cody
introductory
the
life
and
adventures
of
hon
william
cody
buffalo
bill
as
told
by
himself
make
up
a
narrative
which
reads
more
like
romance
than
reality
and
which
in
many
respects
will
prove
a
valuable
contribution
to
the
records
of
our
western
frontier
history
while
no
literary
excellence
is
claimed
for
the
narrative
it
has
the
greater
merit
of
being
truthful
and
is
verified
in
such
a
manner
that
no
one
can
doubt
its
veracity
the
frequent
reference
to
such
military
men
as
generals
sheridan
carr
merritt
crook
terry
colonel
royal
and
other
officers
under
whom
cody
served
as
scout
and
guide
at
different
times
and
in
various
sections
of
the
frontier
during
the
numerous
indian
campaigns
of
the
last
ten
or
twelve
years
affords
ample
proof
of
his
genuineness
as
a
thoroughbred
scout
there
is
no
humbug
or
braggadocio
about
buffalo
bill
he
is
known
far
and
wide
and
his
reputation
has
been
earned
honestly
and
by
hard
work
by
a
combination
of
circumstances
he
was
educated
to
the
life
of
a
plainsman
from
his
youth
up
and
not
the
least
interesting
portion
of
his
career
is
that
of
his
early
life
passed
as
it
was
in
kansas
during
the
eventful
and
troubleous
times
connected
with
the
settlement
of
that
state
spending
much
time
in
the
saddle
while
a
mere
boy
he
crossed
the
plains
many
times
in
company
with
on
some
of
these
trips
he
met
with
thrilling
adventures
and
had
several
hairbreadth
escapes
from
death
at
the
hands
of
indians
then
for
a
while
he
was
dashing
over
the
plains
as
a
rider
soon
afterwards
mounted
on
the
high
seat
of
an
overland
stagecoach
he
was
driving
a
team
we
next
hear
of
him
cracking
the
whip
and
commanding
a
through
a
wild
and
dangerous
country
to
the
far
west
during
the
civil
war
he
enlisted
as
a
private
and
became
a
scout
with
the
union
army
since
the
war
he
has
been
employed
as
hunter
trapper
guide
scout
and
actor
as
a
buffalo
hunter
he
has
no
superior
as
a
trailer
of
indians
he
has
no
equal
for
many
years
he
has
taken
an
active
part
in
all
the
principal
indian
campaigns
on
the
western
frontier
and
as
a
scout
and
guide
he
has
rendered
inestimable
services
to
the
various
expeditions
which
he
accompanied
during
his
life
on
the
plains
he
not
only
had
many
exciting
adventures
himself
but
he
became
associated
with
many
of
the
other
noted
plainsmen
and
in
his
narrative
he
frequently
refers
to
them
and
relates
many
interesting
incidents
and
thrilling
events
connected
with
them
he
has
had
a
fertile
field
from
which
to
produce
this
volume
and
has
frequently
found
it
necessary
to
condense
the
facts
in
order
to
embody
the
most
interesting
events
of
his
life
the
following
from
a
letter
written
by
general
carr
of
the
fifth
cavalry
now
commanding
fort
mcpherson
speaks
for
itself
i
first
met
cody
october
at
buffalo
station
on
the
kansas
pacific
railroad
in
kansas
he
was
scout
and
guide
for
the
seven
companies
of
the
fifth
cavalry
then
under
colonel
royal
and
of
which
i
was
ordered
to
take
the
command
from
his
services
with
my
command
steadily
in
the
field
for
nine
months
from
october
to
july
and
at
subsequent
times
i
am
qualified
to
bear
testimony
to
his
qualities
and
character
he
was
very
modest
and
unassuming
i
did
not
know
for
a
long
time
how
good
a
title
he
had
to
the
appellation
bill
i
am
apt
to
discount
the
claims
of
scouts
as
they
will
occasionally
exaggerate
and
when
i
found
one
who
said
nothing
about
himself
i
did
not
think
much
of
him
till
i
had
proved
him
he
is
a
natural
gentleman
in
his
manners
as
well
as
in
character
and
has
none
of
the
roughness
of
the
typical
frontiersman
he
can
take
his
own
part
when
required
but
i
have
never
heard
of
his
using
a
knife
or
a
pistol
or
engaging
in
a
quarrel
where
it
could
be
avoided
his
personal
strength
and
activity
are
such
that
he
can
hardly
meet
a
man
whom
he
can
not
handle
and
his
temper
and
disposition
are
so
good
that
no
one
has
reason
to
quarrel
with
him
his
is
better
than
a
good
field
glass
he
is
the
best
trailer
i
ever
heard
of
and
also
the
best
judge
of
the
of
country
that
is
he
is
able
to
tell
what
kind
of
country
is
ahead
so
as
to
know
how
to
act
he
is
a
perfect
judge
of
distance
and
always
ready
to
tell
correctly
how
many
miles
it
is
to
water
or
to
any
place
or
how
many
miles
have
been
marched
cody
seemed
never
to
tire
and
was
always
ready
to
go
in
the
darkest
night
or
the
worst
weather
and
usually
volunteered
knowing
what
the
emergency
required
his
trailing
when
following
indians
or
looking
for
stray
animals
or
game
is
simply
wonderful
he
is
a
most
extraordinary
hunter
i
could
not
believe
that
a
man
could
be
certain
to
shoot
antelope
running
till
i
had
seen
him
do
it
so
often
in
a
fight
cody
is
never
noisy
obstreperous
or
excited
in
fact
i
never
hardly
noticed
him
in
a
fight
unless
i
happened
to
want
him
or
he
had
something
to
report
when
he
was
always
in
the
right
place
and
his
information
was
always
valuable
and
reliable
during
the
winter
of
we
encountered
hardships
and
exposure
in
terrific
snow
storms
sleet
etc
on
one
occasion
that
winter
cody
showed
his
quality
by
quietly
offering
to
go
with
some
dispatches
to
general
sheridan
across
a
dangerous
region
where
another
principal
scout
was
reluctant
to
risk
himself
on
the
of
may
he
was
in
the
fight
at
elephant
rock
kansas
and
trailed
the
indians
till
the
when
we
got
another
fight
out
of
them
on
spring
creek
in
nebraska
and
scattered
them
after
following
them
one
hundred
and
fifty
miles
in
three
days
it
was
at
spring
creek
where
cody
was
ahead
of
the
command
about
three
miles
with
the
advance
guard
of
forty
men
when
two
hundred
indians
suddenly
surrounded
them
our
men
dismounted
and
formed
in
a
circle
holding
their
horses
firing
and
slowly
retreating
they
all
to
this
day
speak
of
cody
coolness
and
bravery
this
was
the
dog
soldier
band
which
captured
alderdice
and
weichel
in
kansas
they
strangled
alderdice
baby
killed
weichel
husband
and
took
a
great
deal
of
property
and
stock
from
different
persons
we
got
on
their
trail
again
june
and
followed
it
nearly
two
hundred
miles
till
we
struck
the
indians
on
sunday
july
at
summit
spring
the
indians
as
soon
as
they
saw
us
coming
killed
alderdice
with
a
hatchet
and
shot
weichel
but
fortunately
not
fatally
and
she
was
saved
cody
has
since
served
with
me
as
post
guide
and
scout
at
fort
mcpherson
where
he
frequently
distinguished
himself
in
the
summer
of
cody
went
with
me
to
the
black
hills
region
where
he
killed
afterwards
he
was
with
the
big
horn
and
yellowstone
expedition
i
consider
that
his
services
to
the
country
and
the
army
by
trailing
finding
and
fighting
indians
and
thus
protecting
the
frontier
settlers
and
by
guiding
commands
over
the
best
and
most
practicable
routes
have
been
far
beyond
the
compensation
he
has
received
his
friends
of
the
fifth
cavalry
are
all
glad
that
he
is
in
a
lucrative
business
and
hope
that
he
may
live
long
and
prosper
personally
i
feel
under
obligations
to
him
for
assistance
in
my
campaigns
which
no
other
man
could
or
would
have
rendered
of
course
i
wish
him
and
his
every

the

event
in
my
adventurous
career
being
in
scott

in
the
state
of

my
parents
isaac
and
mary
ann
cody
who
were
numbered
among
the

were

charles
born
in

order
named
at
the
time
of
my
birth
the
family
resided
on
a
farm
which
they
called
napsinekee
place
an
indian
name
and
here
the
first
six
or
seven
years
of
my
childhood
were
spent
when
i
was
about
seven
years
old
my
father
moved
the
family
to
the
little
town
of
leclair
located
on
the
bank
of
the
mississippi
fifteen
miles
above
the
city
of
davenport
even
at
that
early
age
my
adventurous
spirit
led
me
into
all
sorts
of
mischief
and
danger
and
when
i
look
back
upon
my
childhood
days
i
often
wonder
that
i
did
not
get
drowned
while
swimming
or
sailing
or
my
neck
broken
while
i
was
stealing
apples
in
the
neighboring
orchards
i
well
remember
one
day
that
i
went
sailing
with
two
other
boys
in
a
few
minutes
we
found
ourselves
in
the
middle
of
the
mississippi
becoming
frightened
at
the
situation
we
lost
our
presence
of
mind
as
well
as
our
oars
we
at
once
set
up
a
chorus
of
pitiful
yells
when
a
man
who
fortunately
heard
us
came
to
our
rescue
with
a
canoe
and
towed
us
ashore
we
had
stolen
the
boat
and
our
trouble
did
not
end
until
we
had
each
received
a
merited
whipping
which
impressed
the
incident
vividly
upon
my
mind
i
recollect
several
occasions
when
i
was
nearly
eaten
up
by
a
large
and
savage
dog
which
acted
as
custodian
of
an
orchard
and
also
of
a
melon
patch
which
i
frequently
visited
once
as
i
was
climbing
over
the
fence
with
a
hatful
of
apples
this
dog
which
had
started
for
me
caught
me
by
the
seat
of
the
pantaloons
and
while
i
clung
to
the
top
of
the
fence
he
literally
tore
them
from
my
legs
but
fortunately
did
not
touch
my
flesh
i
got
away
with
the
apples
however
by
tumbling
over
to
the
opposite
side
of
the
fence
with
them
it
was
at
leclair
that
i
acquired
my
first
experience
as
an
equestrian
somehow
or
other
i
had
managed
to
corner
a
horse
near
a
fence
and
had
climbed
upon
his
back
the
next
moment
the
horse
got
his
back
up
and
hoisted
me
into
the
air
i
fell
violently
to
the
ground
striking
upon
my
side
in
such
a
way
as
to
severely
wrench
and
strain
my
arm
from
the
effects
of
which
i
did
not
recover
for
some
time
i
abandoned
the
art
of
horsemanship
for
a
while
and
was
induced
after
considerable
persuasion
to
turn
my
attention
to
letters
my
a
b
c
which
were
taught
me
at
the
village
school
my
father
at
this
time
was
running
a
stage
line
between
chicago
and
davenport
no
railroads
then
having
been
built
west
of
chicago
in
he
got
the
california
fever
and
made
up
his
mind
to
cross
the
great
plains
which
were
then
and
for
years
afterwards
called
the
american
desert
to
the
pacific
coast
he
got
ready
a
complete
outfit
and
started
with
quite
a
party
after
proceeding
a
few
miles
all
but
my
father
and
greatly
to
his
disappointment
changed
their
minds
for
some
reason
and
abandoned
the
enterprise
they
all
returned
home
and
soon
afterwards
father
moved
his
family
out
to
walnut
grove
farm
in
scott
county
illustration
youthful
adventures
while
living
there
i
was
sent
to
school
more
for
the
purpose
of
being
kept
out
of
mischief
than
to
learn
anything
much
of
my
time
was
spent
in
trapping
quails
which
were
very
plentiful
i
greatly
enjoyed
studying
the
habits
of
the
little
birds
and
in
devising
traps
to
take
them
in
i
was
most
successful
with
the
common
figure
trap
which
i
could
build
myself
thus
i
think
it
was
that
i
acquired
my
love
for
hunting
i
visited
the
quail
traps
twice
a
day
morning
and
evening
and
as
i
had
now
become
quite
a
good
rider
i
was
allowed
to
have
one
of
the
farm
horses
to
carry
me
over
my
route
many
a
jolly
ride
i
had
and
many
a
boyish
prank
was
perpetrated
after
getting
well
away
from
and
out
of
the
sight
of
home
with
the
horse
there
was
one
event
which
occurred
in
my
childhood
which
i
can
not
recall
without
a
feeling
of
sadness
it
was
the
death
of
my
brother
samuel
who
was
accidentally
killed
in
his
twelfth
year
my
father
at
the
time
being
considerable
of
a
politician
as
well
as
a
farmer
was
attending
a
political
convention
for
he
was
well
known
in
those
days
as
an
old
line
whig
he
had
been
a
member
of
the
iowa
legislature
was
a
justice
of
the
peace
and
had
held
other
offices
he
was
an
excellent
stump
speaker
and
was
often
called
upon
to
canvass
the
country
round
about
for
different
candidates
the
convention
which
he
was
attending
at
the
time
of
the
accident
was
being
held
at
a
tavern
called
sherman
about
a
mile
away
samuel
and
i
had
gone
out
together
on
horseback
for
the
cows
he
rode
a
vicious
mare
which
mother
had
told
him
time
and
again
not
to
ride
as
it
had
an
ugly
disposition
we
were
passing
the
school
house
just
as
the
children
were
being
dismissed
when
samuel
undertook
to
give
an
exhibition
of
his
horsemanship
he
being
a
good
rider
for
a
boy
the
mare
betsy
became
unmanageable
reared
and
fell
backward
upon
him
injuring
him
internally
he
was
picked
up
and
carried
amid
great
excitement
to
the
house
of
a
neighbor
i
at
once
set
out
with
my
horse
at
the
top
of
his
speed
for
my
father
and
informed
him
of
samuel
mishap
he
took
the
horse
and
returned
immediately
when
i
arrived
at
burns
house
where
my
brother
was
i
found
my
father
mother
and
sisters
there
all
weeping
bitterly
at
samuel
bedside
a
physician
after
examining
him
pronounced
his
injuries
to
be
of
a
fatal
character
he
died
the
next
morning
my
brother
was
a
great
favorite
with
everybody
and
his
death
cast
a
gloom
upon
the
whole
neighborhood
it
was
a
great
blow
to
all
of
the
family
and
especially
to
father
who
seemed
to
be
almost
heart
broken
over
it
father
had
been
greatly
disappointed
at
the
failure
of
his
california
expedition
and
still
desired
to
move
to
some
new
country
the
death
of
samuel
no
doubt
increased
this
desire
and
he
determined
to
emigrate
accordingly
early
in
the
spring
of
he
disposed
of
his
farm
and
late
in
march
we
took
our
departure
for
kansas
which
was
then
an
unsettled
territory
our
outfit
consisted
of
one
carriage
three
wagons
and
some
fine
blooded
horses
the
carriage
was
occupied
by
my
mother
and
sisters
thus
we
left
our
iowa
home
illustration
samuel
fatal
accident
father
had
a
brother
elijah
cody
living
at
weston
platte
county
missouri
he
was
the
leading
merchant
of
the
place
as
the
town
was
located
near
the
kansas
line
father
determined
to
visit
him
and
thither
our
journey
was
directed
our
route
lay
across
iowa
and
missouri
and
the
trip
proved
of
interest
to
all
of
us
and
especially
to
me
there
was
something
new
to
be
seen
at
nearly
every
turn
of
the
road
at
night
the
family
generally
put
up
at
hotels
or
taverns
along
the
way
one
day
as
we
were
proceeding
on
our
way
we
were
met
by
a
horseman
who
wanted
to
sell
his
horse
or
for
another
he
said
the
horse
had
been
captured
wild
in
california
that
he
was
a
runner
and
a
racer
that
he
had
been
sold
by
his
different
owners
on
account
of
his
great
desire
to
run
away
when
taking
part
in
a
race
the
stranger
seemed
to
be
very
frank
in
his
statements
and
appeared
to
be
very
anxious
to
get
rid
of
the
animal
and
as
we
were
going
to
kansas
where
there
would
be
plenty
of
room
for
the
horse
to
run
as
far
as
he
pleased
father
concluded
to
make
a
trade
for
him
so
an
exchange
of
animals
was
easily
and
satisfactorily
effected
the
new
horse
being
a
small
gray
we
named
him
little
gray
an
opportunity
of
testing
the
racing
qualities
of
the
horse
was
soon
afforded
one
day
we
drove
into
a
small
missouri
town
or
hamlet
which
lay
on
our
route
where
the
farmers
from
the
surrounding
country
were
congregated
for
the
purpose
of
having
a
holiday
the
principal
amusement
being
father
had
no
trouble
in
arranging
a
race
for
little
gray
and
selected
one
of
his
teamsters
to
ride
him
the
missourians
matched
their
fastest
horse
against
him
and
were
confident
of
cleaning
out
the
emigrant
as
they
called
father
they
were
a
hard
looking
crowd
they
wore
their
pantaloons
in
their
boots
their
hair
was
long
bushy
and
untrimmed
their
faces
had
evidently
never
made
the
acquaintance
of
a
razor
they
seemed
determined
to
win
the
race
by
fair
means
or
foul
they
did
a
great
deal
of
swearing
and
swaggered
about
in
rather
a
ruffianly
style
all
these
incidents
attracted
my
attention
everything
being
new
to
me
and
became
firmly
impressed
upon
my
memory
my
father
being
unaccustomed
to
the
ways
of
such
rough
people
acted
very
cautiously
and
as
they
were
all
very
anxious
to
bet
on
their
own
horse
he
could
not
be
induced
to
wager
a
very
large
sum
on
little
gray
as
he
was
afraid
of
foul
play
now
stranger
exclaimed
one
of
the
crowd
what
kind
o
critter
have
you
got
anyhow
as
how
you
afraid
to
back
him
up
very
heavy
i
bet
five
to
one
agin
the
emergrant
gray
said
another
i
betting
the
same
way
i
go
yer
five
hundred
dollars
agin
a
hundred
that
the
gray
nag
gits
left
behind
do
i
hear
any
man
who
wants
to
come
agin
me
on
them
yer
terms
shouted
still
another
hi
yer
boys
give
the
stranger
a
chance
do
scare
him
out
of
his
boots
said
a
man
who
evidently
was
afraid
that
my
father
might
back
out
father
had
but
little
to
say
however
and
would
not
venture
more
than
fifty
dollars
on
the
result
of
the
race
gentlemen
i
am
only
racing
my
horse
for
sport
said
he
and
am
only
betting
enough
to
make
it
interesting
i
have
never
seen
little
gray
run
and
therefore
do
know
what
he
can
do
at
the
same
time
he
was
confident
that
his
horse
would
come
in
the
winner
as
he
had
chosen
an
excellent
rider
for
him
finally
all
the
preliminaries
of
the
contest
were
arranged
the
judges
were
chosen
and
the
money
was
deposited
in
the
hands
of
a
the
race
was
to
be
a
single
dash
of
a
mile
the
horses
were
brought
side
by
side
and
mounted
by
their
riders
at
the
signal
one
two
three
go
off
they
started
like
a
flash
the
missouri
horse
took
the
lead
for
the
first
quarter
of
a
mile
at
the
however
he
began
to
weaken
the
missourians
shouted
themselves
hoarse
in
urging
their
horse
but
all
to
no
avail
the
little
gray
passed
him
and
continued
to
leave
him
farther
and
farther
behind
easily
winning
the
race
the
affair
created
a
great
deal
of
enthusiasm
but
the
race
was
conducted
with
honor
and
fairness
which
was
quite
an
agreeable
surprise
to
my
father
who
soon
found
the
missourians
to
be
at
heart
very
clever
men
thus
showing
that
outside
appearances
are
sometimes
very
deceptive
they
nearly
all
came
up
and
congratulated
him
on
his
success
asked
him
why
he
had
not
bet
more
money
on
the
race
and
wanted
to
buy
little
gray
gentlemen
said
he
when
i
drove
up
here
and
arranged
for
this
race
i
felt
confident
that
my
horse
would
win
it
i
was
among
entire
strangers
and
therefore
i
only
bet
a
small
amount
i
was
afraid
that
you
would
cheat
me
in
some
way
or
other
i
see
now
that
i
was
mistaken
as
i
have
found
you
to
be
honorable
men
you
could
have
broke
said
the
man
who
wanted
to
bet
the
five
hundred
dollars
to
one
hundred
for
that
there
nag
o
yourn
looks
no
more
like
a
runner
nor
i
do
during
our
stay
in
the
place
they
treated
us
very
kindly
and
continued
to
try
to
purchase
little
gray
my
father
however
remained
firm
in
his
determination
not
to
part
with
him
the
next
place
of
interest
which
we
reached
after
resuming
our
journey
was
within
twenty
miles
of
weston
we
had
been
stopping
at
farm
houses
along
the
road
and
could
not
get
anything
to
eat
in
the
shape
of
bread
except
corn
bread
of
which
all
had
become
heartily
tired
as
we
were
driving
along
we
saw
in
the
distance
a
large
and
handsome
brick
residence
father
said
they
probably
have
white
bread
there
we
drove
up
to
the
house
and
learned
that
it
was
owned
and
occupied
by
burns
mother
of
a
lawyer
of
that
name
who
is
now
living
in
leavenworth
she
was
a
wealthy
lady
and
gave
us
to
understand
in
a
pleasant
way
that
she
did
not
entertain
travelers
my
father
in
the
course
of
the
conversation
with
her
said
do
you
know
elijah
cody
indeed
i
do
said
she
he
frequently
visits
us
and
we
visit
him
we
are
the
best
of
friends
he
is
a
brother
of
mine
said
father
is
it
possible
she
exclaimed
why
you
must
remain
here
all
night
have
your
family
come
into
the
house
at
once
you
must
not
go
another
step
today
the
kind
invitation
was
accepted
and
we
remained
there
over
night
as
father
had
predicted
we
found
plenty
of
white
bread
at
this
house
and
it
proved
quite
a
luxurious
treat
my
curiosity
was
considerably
aroused
by
the
many
negroes
which
i
saw
about
the
premises
as
i
had
scarcely
ever
seen
any
colored
people
the
few
being
on
the
steamboats
as
they
passed
up
and
down
the
mississippi
river
the
next
day
my
father
and
mother
drove
over
to
weston
in
a
carriage
and
returned
with
my
uncle
elijah
we
then
all
proceeded
to
his
house
and
as
kansas
was
not
yet
open
for
settlement
as
a
territory
we
remained
there
a
few
days
while
father
crossed
over
into
kansas
on
a
prospecting
tour
he
visited
the
kickapoo
agency
five
miles
above
weston
on
the
kansas
side
of
the
missouri
river
he
became
acquainted
with
the
agent
and
made
arrangements
to
establish
himself
there
as
an
indian
trader
he
then
returned
to
weston
and
located
the
family
on
one
of
elijah
farms
three
miles
from
town
where
we
were
to
remain
until
kansas
should
be
thrown
open
for
settlement
after
completing
these
arrangements
he
established
a
trading
post
at
salt
creek
valley
in
kansas
four
miles
from
the
kickapoo
agency
one
day
after
he
had
been
absent
some
little
time
he
came
home
and
said
that
he
had
bought
two
ponies
for
me
and
that
next
morning
he
would
take
me
over
into
kansas
this
was
pleasant
news
as
i
had
been
very
anxious
to
go
there
with
him
and
the
fact
that
i
was
now
the
owner
of
two
ponies
made
me
feel
very
proud
that
night
i
could
not
sleep
a
wink
in
the
morning
i
was
up
long
before
the
sun
and
after
an
early
breakfast
father
and
i
started
out
on
our
trip
crossing
the
missouri
river
at
the
rialto
ferry
we
landed
in
kansas
and
passed
along
to
fort
leavenworth
four
miles
distant
chapter
ii
early
influences
general
harney
was
in
command
at
fort
leavenworth
at
the
time
of
our
visit
and
a
regiment
of
cavalry
was
stationed
there
they
were
having
a
dress
parade
when
we
rode
up
and
as
this
was
the
first
time
that
i
had
ever
seen
any
soldiers
i
thought
it
was
a
grand
sight
i
shall
never
forget
it
especially
the
manoeuvres
on
horseback
after
witnessing
the
parade
we
resumed
our
journey
on
the
way
to
my
father
trading
camp
we
had
to
cross
over
a
high
hill
known
as
salt
creek
hill
from
the
top
of
which
we
looked
down
upon
the
most
beautiful
valley
i
have
ever
seen
it
was
about
twelve
miles
long
and
five
miles
wide
the
different
tributaries
of
salt
creek
came
down
from
the
range
of
hills
at
the
southwest
at
the
foot
of
the
valley
another
small
river
plum
creek
also
flowed
the
bluffs
fringed
with
trees
clad
in
their
full
foliage
added
greatly
to
the
picturesqueness
of
the
scene
while
this
beautiful
valley
greatly
interested
me
yet
the
most
novel
sight
of
an
entirely
different
character
which
met
my
enraptured
gaze
was
the
vast
number
of
wagons
or
which
were
encamped
along
the
different
streams
i
asked
my
father
what
they
were
and
where
they
were
going
he
explained
to
me
that
they
were
emigrant
wagons
bound
for
utah
and
california
at
that
time
the
mormon
and
california
trails
ran
through
this
valley
which
was
always
selected
as
a
camping
place
there
were
at
least
one
thousand
wagons
in
the
valley
and
their
white
covers
lent
a
pleasing
contrast
to
the
green
grass
the
cattle
were
quietly
grazing
near
the
wagons
while
the
emigrants
were
either
resting
or
attending
to
camp
duties
a
large
number
of
the
wagons
as
i
learned
from
my
father
belonged
to
majors
russell
the
great
government
freighters
they
had
several
trains
there
each
consisting
of
wagons
heavily
loaded
with
government
supplies
they
were
all
camped
and
corraled
in
a
circle
while
we
were
viewing
this
scene
a
long
wagon
train
came
pulling
up
the
hill
bound
out
from
fort
leavenworth
to
some
distant
frontier
post
the
cattle
were
wild
and
the
men
were
whipping
them
fearfully
the
loud
reports
of
the
sounding
like
they
were
and
some
of
the
wagons
were
being
drawn
by
fifteen
yokes
of
oxen
i
remember
asking
my
father
a
great
many
questions
and
he
explained
to
me
all
about
the
freighting
business
across
the
great
plains
and
told
me
about
the
different
government
posts
pointing
over
to
the
army
of
wagons
camped
below
us
he
showed
me
which
were
the
mormons
and
which
were
the
californians
and
said
that
we
must
steer
clear
of
the
former
as
the
cholera
was
raging
among
them
five
hundred
had
died
that
spring
and
the
was
daily
increasing
its
dimensions
the
unfortunate
people
had
been
overtaken
by
the
dreadful
disease
and
had
been
compelled
to
halt
on
their
journey
until
it
abated
while
we
were
looking
at
the
mormons
they
were
holding
a
funeral
service
over
the
remains
of
some
of
their
number
who
had
died
their
old
cemetery
is
yet
indicated
by
various
which
however
with
the
few
remaining
are
fast
disappearing
we
passed
on
through
this
valley
of
death
as
it
might
then
have
been
very
appropriately
called
and
after
riding
for
some
time
my
father
pointed
out
a
large
hill
and
showed
me
his
camp
which
afterwards
became
our
home
there
was
another
near
by
which
was
conducted
by
rively
who
had
a
store
built
partly
frame
and
partly
of
logs
we
stopped
at
this
establishment
for
a
while
and
found
perhaps
a
hundred
men
women
and
children
gathered
there
engaged
in
trading
and
gossipping
the
men
had
huge
pistols
and
knives
in
their
belts
their
pantaloons
were
tucked
in
their
boots
and
they
wore
large
hats
to
me
they
appeared
like
a
lot
of
pirates
who
had
come
ashore
for
a
lark
it
was
the
first
time
i
had
ever
seen
men
carrying
pistols
and
knives
and
they
looked
like
a
very
dangerous
crowd
some
were
buying
articles
of
merchandise
others
were
talking
about
the
cholera
the
various
camps
and
matters
of
interest
while
others
were
drinking
whisky
freely
and
becoming
intoxicated
it
was
a
busy
and
an
exciting
scene
and
rively
appeared
to
be
doing
a
rushing
trade
at
some
little
distance
from
the
store
i
noticed
a
small
party
of
and
rather
fantastically
dressed
people
whom
i
ascertained
were
indians
and
as
i
had
never
before
seen
a
real
live
indian
i
was
much
interested
in
them
i
went
over
and
endeavored
to
talk
to
them
but
our
conversation
was
very
limited
that
evening
we
reached
our
camp
which
was
located
two
miles
west
of
rively
the
first
thing
i
did
was
to
hunt
up
my
ponies
and
from
my
father
description
of
them
i
had
no
difficulty
in
finding
them
they
were
lariated
in
the
grass
and
i
immediately
ran
up
to
them
supposing
them
to
be
gentle
animals
i
was
greatly
mistaken
however
as
they
snorted
and
jumped
away
from
me
and
would
not
allow
me
to
come
near
them
my
father
who
was
standing
not
far
distant
informed
me
that
the
ponies
were
not
yet
broken
i
was
somewhat
disappointed
at
this
and
thereupon
he
and
one
of
his
men
caught
one
of
the
animals
and
bridled
her
then
putting
me
on
her
back
led
her
around
greatly
to
my
delight
i
kept
petting
her
so
much
that
she
soon
allowed
me
to
approach
her
she
was
a
beautiful
bay
and
i
named
her
dolly
the
other
pony
was
a
sorrel
and
i
called
him
prince
in
the
evening
some
indians
visited
the
camp
which
as
yet
consisted
only
of
tents
though
some
logs
had
been
cut
preparatory
to
building
houses
and
exchanged
their
furs
for
clothing
sugar
and
tobacco
father
had
not
learned
their
language
and
therefore
communicated
with
them
by
means
of
signs
we
had
our
supper
by
the
and
that
night
was
the
first
time
i
ever
camped
out
and
slept
upon
the
ground
the
day
had
been
an
eventful
one
to
me
for
all
the
incidents
were
full
of
excitement
and
romance
to
my
youthful
mind
and
i
think
no
apology
is
needed
for
mentioning
so
many
of
the
little
circumstances
which
so
greatly
interested
me
in
my
childhood
days
and
which
no
doubt
had
a
great
influence
in
shaping
my
course
in
after
years
my
love
of
hunting
and
scouting
and
life
on
the
plains
generally
was
the
result
of
my
early
surroundings
the
next
morning
father
visited
the
kickapoo
agency
taking
me
along
he
rode
a
horse
and
putting
me
on
my
pony
dolly
led
the
animal
all
the
way
he
seemed
anxious
to
break
me
in
as
well
as
the
pony
and
i
greatly
enjoyed
this
my
first
day
ride
on
a
kansas
prairie
at
the
kickapoo
village
i
saw
hundreds
of
indians
some
of
whom
were
living
in
lodges
but
the
majority
occupied
log
cabins
the
agent
resided
in
a
log
house
one
of
the
apartments
of
which
was
used
as
a
school
for
the
indians
the
agency
store
was
opposite
this
structure
all
the
buildings
were
whitewashed
and
looked
neat
and
clean
the
kickapoos
were
very
friendly
indians
and
we
spent
much
of
our
time
among
them
looking
about
and
studying
their
habits
after
a
while
we
returned
to
our
own
camp
and
just
as
we
arrived
there
we
saw
a
drove
of
horses
there
were
three
or
four
hundred
in
all
approaching
from
the
west
over
the
california
trail
they
were
being
driven
by
seven
or
eight
mounted
men
wearing
sombreros
and
dressed
in
buckskin
with
their
lariats
dangling
from
their
saddles
and
they
were
followed
by
two
or
three
or
horses
they
went
into
camp
a
little
below
us
on
the
bank
of
the
stream
presently
one
of
the
men
walked
out
towards
our
camp
and
my
father
called
to
me
to
come
and
see
a
genuine
western
man
he
was
about
six
feet
two
inches
tall
was
well
built
and
had
a
light
springy
and
wiry
step
he
wore
a
california
hat
and
was
dressed
in
a
complete
suit
of
buckskin
beautifully
trimmed
and
beaded
he
saluted
us
and
father
invited
him
to
sit
down
which
he
did
after
a
few
moments
conversation
he
turned
to
me
and
said
little
one
i
see
you
are
working
with
your
ponies
they
are
wild
yet
i
had
been
petting
dolly
and
trying
to
break
her
when
my
father
called
me
to
come
and
look
at
the
californian
yes
i
replied
and
one
of
them
never
has
been
ridden
well
i
ride
him
for
you
and
springing
lightly
to
his
feet
he
continued
come
on
where
is
the
animal
accordingly
we
all
went
to
the
place
where
prince
was
lariated
the
stranger
untied
the
rope
from
the
picket
pin
and
taking
a
around
the
pony
nose
he
jumped
on
his
back
in
a
moment
he
was
flying
over
the
prairie
the
untamed
steed
rearing
and
pitching
every
once
in
a
while
in
his
efforts
to
throw
his
rider
but
the
man
was
not
unseated
he
was
evidently
an
experienced
horseman
i
watched
his
every
movement
i
was
unconsciously
taking
another
lesson
in
the
practical
education
which
has
served
me
so
well
through
my
life
the
californian
rode
the
pony
until
it
was
completely
mastered
then
coming
up
to
me
jumped
to
the
ground
handed
me
the
rope
and
said
here
your
pony
he
all
right
now
i
led
prince
away
while
father
and
the
stranger
sat
down
in
the
shade
of
a
tent
and
began
talking
about
the
latter
horsemanship
which
father
considered
very
remarkable
oh
that
nothing
i
was
raised
on
horseback
said
the
californian
i
ran
away
from
home
when
a
boy
went
to
sea
and
finally
landed
in
the
sandwich
islands
where
i
fell
in
with
a
circus
with
which
i
remained
two
years
during
that
time
i
became
a
celebrated
rider
i
then
went
to
california
being
attracted
there
by
the
gold
excitement
the
news
of
which
had
reached
the
islands
i
did
not
go
to
mining
however
but
went
to
work
as
a
and
breaking
wild
horses
great
numbers
of
which
were
roaming
through
california
last
summer
we
caught
this
herd
that
we
have
brought
with
us
across
the
plains
and
are
taking
it
to
the
states
to
sell
i
came
with
the
outfit
as
it
gave
me
a
good
opportunity
to
visit
my
relatives
who
live
at
cleveland
ohio
i
also
had
an
uncle
over
at
weston
across
the
river
when
i
ran
away
and
i
am
going
to
visit
the
town
to
see
if
he
is
there
yet
illustration
billings
as
a
bocarro
i
am
acquainted
in
weston
said
father
and
perhaps
i
can
tell
you
about
your
uncle
what
is
his
name
elijah
cody
said
the
californian
elijah
cody
exclaimed
father
in
great
surprise
why
elijah
cody
is
my
brother
i
am
isaac
cody
who
are

my
name
is
horace
billings
was
the
reply
and
you
are
my
nephew
you
are
the
son
of
my
sister
sophia
both
men
sprang
to
their
feet
and
began
shaking
hands
in
the
heartiest
manner
possible
the
next
moment
father
called
me
and
said
come
here
my
son
here
is
some
one
you
want
to
know
as
i
approached
he
introduced
us
horace
this
is
my
only
son
we
call
him
little
billy
and
turning
to
me
said
billy
my
boy
this
is
a
cousin
of
yours
horace
billings
whom
you
often
heard
me
speak
of
horace
billings
had
never
been
heard
of
from
the
day
he
ran
away
from
home
and
his
relatives
had
frequently
wondered
what
had
become
of
him
his
appearance
therefore
in
our
camp
in
the
guise
of
a
californian
was
somewhat
of
a
mystery
to
me
and
i
could
hardly
comprehend
it
until
i
had
heard
his
adventurous
story
and
learned
the
accidental
manner
in
which
he
and
father
had
made
themselves
known
to
each
other
neither
father
nor
myself
would
be
satisfied
until
he
had
given
us
a
full
account
of
his
wanderings
and
adventures
which
were
very
exciting
to
me
late
in
the
afternoon
and
just
before
the
sun
sank
to
rest
the
conversation
again
turned
upon
horses
and
horsemanship
father
told
billings
all
about
little
gray
and
his
great
fault
of
running
away
billings
laughed
and
said
little
gray
could
not
run
away
with
him
after
supper
he
went
out
to
look
at
the
horse
which
was
picketed
in
the
grass
surveying
the
animal
carefully
he
untied
the
lariat
and
slipped
a
running
noose
over
his
nose
then
giving
a
light
bound
he
was
on
his
back
in
a
second
and
away
went
the
horse
and
his
rider
circling
round
and
round
on
the
prairie
billings
managed
him
by
the
rope
alone
and
convinced
him
that
he
was
his
master
when
half
a
mile
away
the
horse
started
for
camp
at
the
top
of
his
speed
billings
stood
straight
up
on
his
back
and
thus
rode
him
into
camp
as
he
passed
us
he
jumped
to
the
ground
allowed
the
horse
to
run
to
the
full
length
of
the
lariat
when
he
threw
him
a
complete
somersault

riding
little
gray
that
a
pretty
good
horse
said
billings
yes
he
a
california
horse
he
was
captured
there
wild
replied
father
the
exhibition
of
horsemanship
given
by
billings
on
this
occasion
was
really
wonderful
and
was
the
most
skillful
and
daring
feat
of
the
kind
that
i
ever
witnessed
the
remainder
of
the
evening
was
spent
around
the
camp
and
horace
who
remained
there
entertained
us
with
several
interesting
chapters
of
his
experiences
next
morning
he
walked
over
to
his
own
camp
but
soon
returned
mounted
on
a
beautiful
horse
with
a
handsome
saddle
bridle
and
lariat
i
thought
he
was
a
magnificent
looking
man
i
envied
his
appearance
and
my
ambition
just
then
was
to
become
as
skillful
a
horseman
as
he
was
he
had
rigged
himself
out
in
his
best
style
in
order
to
make
a
good
impression
on
his
uncle
at
weston
whither
father
and
i
accompanied
him
on
horseback
he
was
cordially
received
by
uncle
elijah
who
paid
him
every
possible
attention
and
gave
me
a
handsome
saddle
and
bridle
for
my
pony
and
in
the
evening
when
we
rode
out
to
the
farm
to
see
my
mother
and
sisters
i
started
ahead
to
show
them
my
present
as
well
as
to
tell
them
who
was
coming
they
were
delighted
to
see
the
horace
and
invited
him
to
remain
with
us
when
we
returned
to
camp
next
day
horace
settled
up
with
the
proprietor
of
the
horses
having
concluded
to
make
his
home
with
us
for
that
summer
at
least
father
employed
him
in
cutting
house
logs
and
building
houses
but
this
work
not
being
adapted
to
his
tastes
he
soon
gave
it
up
and
obtained
government
employment
in
catching
united
states
horses
during
the
previous
spring
the
government
herd
had
stampeded
from
fort
leavenworth
and
between
two
and
three
hundred
of
the
horses
were
running
at
large
over
the
kansas
prairies
and
had
become
quite
wild
a
reward
of
ten
dollars
was
offered
for
every
one
of
the
horses
that
was
captured
and
delivered
to
the
quartermaster
at
fort
leavenworth
this
kind
of
work
of
course
just
suited
the
roaming
disposition
of
billings
especially
as
it
was
similar
to
that
in
which
he
had
been
engaged
in
california
the
horses
had
to
be
caught
with
a
lasso
with
which
he
was
very
expert
he
borrowed
little
gray
who
was
fleet
enough
for
the
wildest
of
the
runaways
and
then
he
at
once
began
his
horse
hunting
illustration
exciting
sport
everything
that
he
did
i
wanted
to
do
he
was
a
sort
of
hero
in
my
eyes
and
i
wished
to
follow
in
his
footsteps
at
my
request
and
with
consent
he
took
me
with
him
and
many
a
wild
and
perilous
chase
he
led
me
over
the
prairie
i
made
rapid
advances
in
the
art
of
horsemanship
for
i
could
have
had
no
better
teacher
than
horace
billings
he
also
taught
me
how
to
throw
the
lasso
which
though
it
was
a
difficult
thing
to
learn
i
finally
became
quite
skillful
in
whenever
horace
caught
one
of
the
horses
which
acted
obstinately
and
would
not
be
led
he
immediately
threw
him
to
the
ground
put
a
saddle
and
bridle
on
him
and
gave
me
little
gray
to
take
care
of
he
would
then
mount
the
captive
horse
and
ride
him
into
fort
leavenworth
i
spent
two
months
with
horace
in
this
way
until
at
last
no
more
of
the
horses
were
to
be
found
by
this
time
i
had
become
a
remarkably
good
rider
for
a
youth
and
had
brought
both
of
my
ponies
under
easy
control
horace
returned
to
assist
father
in
hauling
logs
which
were
being
used
in
building
a
dwelling
for
the
family
who
had
moved
over
from
missouri
one
day
a
team
did
not
work
to
suit
him
and
he
gave
the
horses
a
cruel
beating
this
greatly
displeased
father
who
took
him
to
task
for
it
horace
anger
flew
up
in
a
moment
throwing
down
the
lines
he
hurried
to
the
house
and
began
packing
up
his
traps
that
same
day
he
hired
out
to
a
mormon
train
and
bidding
us
all
started
for
salt

six
yokes
of
oxen

boy
days
in
kansas
during
the
summer
of
we
lived
in
our
little
log
house
and
father
continued
to
trade
with
the
indians
who
became
very
friendly
hardly
a
day
passed
without
a
social
visit
from
them
i
spent
a
great
deal
of
time
with
the
indian
boys
who
taught
me
how
to
shoot
with
the
bow
and
arrow
at
which
i
became
quite
expert
i
also
took
part
in
all
their
sports
and
learned
to
talk
the
kickapoo
language
to
some
extent
father
desired
to
express
his
friendship
for
these
indians
and
accordingly
arranged
a
grand
barbecue
for
them
he
invited
them
all
to
be
present
on
a
certain
day
which
they
were
he
then
presented
them
with
two
fat
beeves
to
be
killed
and
cooked
in
the
various
indian
styles
mother
made
several
large
boilers
full
of
coffee
which
she
gave
to
them
together
with
sugar
and
bread
there
were
about
two
hundred
indians
in
attendance
at
the
feast
and
they
all
enjoyed
and
appreciated
it
in
the
evening
they
had
one
of
their
grand
fantastic
war
dances
which
greatly
amused
me
it
being
the
first
sight
of
the
kind
i
had
ever
witnessed
my
uncle
elijah
and
quite
a
large
number
of
gentlemen
and
ladies
came
over
from
weston
to
attend
the
entertainment
the
indians
returned
to
their
homes
well
satisfied
my
uncle
at
that
time
owned
a
trading
post
at
silver
lake
in
the
pottawattamie
country
on
the
kansas
river
and
he
arranged
an
excursion
to
that
place
among
the
party
were
several
ladies
from
weston
and
father
mother
and
myself
mcmeekan
my
uncle
superintendent
who
had
come
to
weston
for
supplies
conducted
the
party
to
the
post
the
trip
across
the
prairies
was
a
delightful
one
and
we
remained
at
the
post
several
days
father
and
one
or
two
of
the
men
went
on
to
fort
riley
to
view
the
country
and
upon
their
return
my
uncle
entertained
the
pottawattamie
indians
with
a
barbecue
similar
to
the
one
given
by
father
to
the
kickapoos
during
the
latter
part
of
the
summer
father
filled
a
hay
contract
at
fort
leavenworth
i
passed
much
of
my
time
among
the
campers
and
spent
days
and
days
in
riding
over
the
country
with
william
russell
who
was
engaged
in
the
freighting
business
and
who
seemed
to
take
a
considerable
interest
in
me
in
this
way
i
became
acquainted
with
many
hunters
and
teamsters
and
learned
a
great
deal
about
the
business
of
handling
cattle
and
mules
it
was
an
excellent
school
for
me
and
i
acquired
a
great
deal
of
practical
knowledge
which
afterwards
i
found
to
be
of
invaluable
service
for
it
was
not
long
before
i
became
employed
by
majors
russell
remaining
with
them
in
different
capacities
for
several
years
the
winter
of
was
spent
by
father
at
our
little
prairie
home
in
cutting
house
logs
and
fence
rails
which
he
intended
to
use
on
his
farm
as
soon
as
the
bill
for
the
opening
of
the
territory
for
settlement
should
pass
this
bill
which
was
called
the
enabling
act
of
kansas
territory
was
passed
in
april
and
father
immediately
the
claim
on
which
we
were
living
the
summer
of
that
year
was
an
exciting
period
in
the
history
of
the
new
territory
thousands
and
thousands
of
people
seeking
new
homes
flocked
thither
a
large
number
of
the
emigrants
coming
over
from
adjoining
states
the
missourians
some
of
them
would
come
laden
with
bottles
of
whisky
and
after
drinking
the
liquor
would
drive
the
bottles
into
the
ground
to
mark
their
land
claims
not
waiting
to
put
up
any
buildings
the
missourians
mostly
were
men
and
held
enthusiastic
meetings
at
which
they
expressed
their
desire
that
kansas
should
be
a
slave
state
and
did
not
hesitate
to
declare
their
determination
to
make
it
so
rively
store
was
the
headquarters
for
these
men
and
there
they
held
their
meetings
illustration
staking
out
lots
at
first
they
thought
father
would
coincide
with
them
on
account
of
his
brother
elijah
being
a
missourian
but
in
this
they
were
greatly
mistaken
at
one
of
their
gatherings
when
there
were
about
one
hundred
of
the
reckless
men
present
my
father
who
happened
also
to
be
there
was
called
upon
for
a
speech
after
considerable
urging
he
mounted
the
box
and
began
speaking
as
nearly
as
i
can
recollect
as
follows
gentlemen
and
you
have
called
upon
me
for
a
speech
and
i
have
accepted
your
invitation
rather
against
my
will
as
my
views
may
not
accord
with
the
sentiments
of
the
rest
of
this
assembly
my
remarks
at
this
time
will
be
brief
and
to
the
point
the
question
before
us
is
shall
the
territory
of
kansas
be
a
free
or
a
slave
state
the
question
of
slavery
in
itself
is
a
broad
one
and
one
which
i
do
not
care
at
this
time
and
place
to
discuss
at
length
i
apprehend
that
your
motive
in
calling
upon
me
is
to
have
me
express
my
sentiments
in
regard
to
the
introduction
of
slavery
into
kansas
i
shall
gratify
your
wishes
in
that
respect
i
was
one
of
the
pioneers
of
the
state
of
iowa
and
aided
in
its
settlement
when
it
was
a
territory
and
helped
to
organize
it
as
a
state
gentlemen
i
voted
that
it
should
be
a
state
that
negroes
whether
free
or
slave
should
never
be
allowed
to
locate
within
its
limits
and
gentlemen
i
say
to
you
now
and
i
say
it
boldly
that
i
propose
to
exert
all
my
power
in
making
kansas
the
same
kind
of
a
state
as
iowa
i
believe
in
letting
slavery
remain
as
it
now
exists
and
i
shall
always
oppose
its
further
extension
these
are
my
sentiments
gentlemen
and
let
me
tell
you
he
never
finished
this
sentence
or
his
speech
his
expressions
were
anything
but
acceptable
to
the
crowd
whose
ire
had
been
gradually
rising
to
fever
heat
and
at
this
point
they
hooted
and
hissed
him
and
shouted
you
black
abolitionist
shut
up
get
down
from
that
box
kill
him
shoot
him
and
so
on
father
however
maintained
his
position
on
the
box
notwithstanding
the
excitement
and
the
numerous
invitations
to
step
down
until
a
man
who
was
in
the
employ
of
my
uncle
elijah
crowded
up
and
said
get
off
that
box
you
black
abolitionist
or
i
pull
you
off
father
paid
but
little
attention
to
him
and
attempted
to
resume
his
speech
intending
doubtless
to
explain
his
position
and
endeavor
to
somewhat
pacify
the
angry
crowd
but
the
fellow
jumped
up
on
the
box
and
pulling
out
a
huge
bowie
knife
stabbed
father
twice
who
reeled
and
fell
to
the
ground
the
man
sprang
after
him
and
would
have
ended
his
life
then
and
there
had
not
some
of
the
better
men
in
the
crowd
interfered
in
time
to
prevent
him
from
carrying
out
his
murderous
intention
the
excitement
was
intense
and
another
assault
would
probably
have
been
made
on
my
father
had
not
rively
hurriedly
carried
him
to
his
home
there
was
no
doctor
within
any
reasonable
distance
and
father
at
once
requested
that
he
be
conveyed
in
the
carriage
to
his
brother
house
in
weston
my
mother
and
a
driver
accordingly
went
there
with
him
where
his
wounds
were
dressed
he
remained
in
weston
several
weeks
before
he
was
able
to
stir
about
again
but
he
never
fully
recovered
from
the
wounds
which
eventually
proved
the
cause
of
his
death

one
night
a
body
of

men
mounted

horses
rode
up
to

surrounded
it
knowing
what
they
had
come
for
and
seeing
that
there
would
be
but
little
chance
for
him

determined
to
make
his
escape

a
little
stratagem
hastily
disguising
himself
in
mother
bonnet
and
shawl
he
boldly
walked
out
of
the
house
and
proceeded
towards
the
the
darkness
proved
a
great
protection
as
the
horsemen
between
whom
he
passed
were
unable
to
detect
him
in
his
disguise
supposing
him
to
be
a
woman
they
neither
halted
him
nor
followed
him
and
he
passed
safely
on
into
the
where
he
concealed
himself
the
horsemen
soon
dismounted
and
inquired
for
father

very
truthfully
told
them
that
he
was
away
they
were
not
satisfied
with
her
statement

made
a
thorough
search
of
the
house
they
raved
and
swore
when
they
could
not
find
him
and
threatened
him
with
death
whenever
they
should
catch
him
i
am
sure
if
they
had
captured
him
that
night
they
would
have
killed
him
they
carried
off
nearly
everything
of
value
in
the
house
and
about
the
premises
then
going
to
the
pasture
they
drove
off
all
the
horses
my
pony
prince
afterward
succeeding
in
breaking
away
from
them
and
came
back
home
father
lay
secreted
in
the
for
three
days
as
there
were
men
in
the
vicinity
who
were
watching
for
him
all
the
time
he
finally
made
his
escape
and
reached
fort
leavenworth
in
safety
whither
the
men
did
not
dare
to
follow
him
while
he
was
staying
at
fort
leavenworth
he
heard
that
jim
lane
captain
cleveland
and
captain
chandler
were
on
their
way
from
indiana
to
kansas
with
a
body
of
free
state
men
between
two
and
three
hundred
strong
they
were
to
cross
the
missouri
river
near
doniphan
between
leavenworth
and
nebraska
city
their
destination
being
lawrence
father
determined
to
join
them
and
took
passage
on
a
steamboat
which
was
going
up
the
river
having
reached
the
place
of
crossing
he
made
himself
known
to
the
leaders
of
the
party
by
whom
he
was
most
cordially
received
the
men
hearing
of
the
approach
of
the
free
state
party
resolved
to
drive
them
out
of
the
territory
the
two
parties
met
at
hickory
point
where
a
severe
battle
was
fought
several
being
killed
the
victory
resulted
in
favor
of
the
free
state
men
who
passed
on
to
lawrence
without
much
further
opposition
my
father
finally
left
them
and
seeing
that
he
could
no
longer
live
at
home
went
to
grasshopper
falls
miles
west
of
leavenworth
there
he
began
the
erection
of
a
while
he
was
thus
engaged
we
learned
from
one
of
our
hired
workmen
at
home
that
the
men
had
laid
another
plan
to
kill
him
and
were
on
their
way
to
grasshopper
falls
to
carry
out
their
intention
mother
at
once
started
me
off
on
prince
to
warn
father
of
the
coming
danger
when
i
had
gone
about
seven
miles
i
suddenly
came
upon
a
party
of
men
who
were
camped
at
the
crossing
of
stranger
creek
as
i
passed
along
i
heard
one
of
them
who
recognized
me
say
that
the
son
of
the
old
abolitionist
we
are
after
and
the
next
moment
i
was
commanded
to
halt
illustration
life
or
death
instead
of
stopping
i
instantly
started
my
pony
on
a
run
and
on
looking
back
i
saw
that
i
was
being
pursued
by
three
or
four
of
the
party
who
had
mounted
their
horses
no
doubt
supposing
that
they
could
easily
capture
me
it
was
very
fortunate
that
i
had
heard
the
remark
about
my
being
the
son
of
the
abolitionist
for
then
i
knew
in
an
instant
that
they
were
to
grasshopper
falls
to
murder
my
father
i
at
once
saw
the
importance
of
my
escaping
and
warning
father
in
time
it
was
a
matter
of
life
or
death
to
him
so
i
urged
prince
to
his
utmost
speed
feeling
that
upon
him
and
myself
depended
a
human
life
a
life
that
was
dearer
to
me
than
that
of
any
other
man
in
the
world
i
led
my
pursuers
a
lively
chase
for
four
or
five
miles
finally
when
they
saw
they
could
not
catch
me
they
returned
to
their
camp
i
kept
straight
on
to
grasshopper
falls
arriving
there
in
ample
time
to
inform
him
of
the
approach
of
his
old
enemies
that
same
night
father
and
i
rode
to
lawrence
which
had
become
the
headquarters
of
the
free
state
men
there
he
met
jim
lane
and
several
other
leading
characters
who
were
then
organizing
what
was
known
as
the
lecompton
legislature
father
was
elected
as
a
member
of
that
body
and
took
an
active
part
in
organizing
the
first
legislature
of
kansas
under
governor
reeder
who
by
the
way
was
a
free
state
man
and
a
great
friend
of
father
about
this
time
agents
were
being
sent
to
the
east
to
induce
emigrants
to
locate
in
kansas
and
father
was
sent
as
one
of
these
agents
to
ohio
after
the
legislature
had
been
organized
at
lawrence
he
departed
for
ohio
and
was
absent
several
months
a
few
days
after
he
had
gone
i
started
for
home
by
the
way
of
fort
leavenworth
accompanied
by
two
men
who
were
going
to
the
fort
on
business
as
we
were
crossing
a
stream
called
little
stranger
we
were
fired
upon
by
some
unknown
party
one
of
my
companions
whose
name
has
escaped
my
memory
was
killed
the
other
man
and
myself
put
spurs
to
our
horses
and
made
a
dash
for
our
lives
we
succeeded
in
making
our
escape
though
a
farewell
shot
or
two
was
sent
after
us
at
fort
leavenworth
i
parted
company
with
my
companion
and
reached
home
without
any
further
adventure
my
mother
and
sisters
who
had
not
heard
of
my
father
or
myself
since
i
had
been
sent
to
warn
him
of
his
danger
had
become
very
anxious
and
uneasy
about
us
and
were
uncertain
as
to
whether
we
were
dead
or
alive
i
received
a
warm
welcome
home
and
as
i
entered
the
house
mother
seemed
to
read
from
the
expression
of
my
countenance
that
father
was
safe
of
course
the
very
first
question
she
asked
was
as
to
his
whereabouts
and
in
reply
i
handed
her
a
long
letter
from
him
which
explained
everything
mother
blessed
me
again
and
again
for
having
saved
his
life
while
father
was
absent
in
ohio
we
were
almost
daily
visited
by
some
of
the
men
who
helped
themselves
to
anything
they
saw
fit
and
frequently
compelled
my
mother
and
sisters
to
cook
for
them
and
to
otherwise
submit
to
a
great
deal
of
bad
treatment
hardly
a
day
passed
without
some
of
them
inquiring
where
the
old
man
was
saying
they
would
kill
him
on
sight
thus
we
passed
the
summer
of
remaining
at
our
home
notwithstanding
the
unpleasant
surroundings
as
mother
had
made
up
her
mind
not
to
be
driven
out
of
the
country
my
uncle
and
other
friends
advised
her
to
leave
kansas
and
move
to
missouri
because
they
did
not
consider
our
lives
safe
as
we
lived
so
near
the
headquarters
of
the
men
who
had
sworn
vengeance
upon
father
nothing
however
could
persuade
mother
to
change
her
determination
she
said
that
the
men
had
taken
everything
except
the
land
and
the
little
home
and
she
proposed
to
remain
there
as
long
as
she
lived
happen
what
might
our
only
friends
in
salt
creek
valley
were
two
families
one
named
lawrence
the
other
hathaway
and
the
peaceable
indians
who
occasionally
visited
us
my
uncle
living
in
missouri
and
being
somewhat
in
fear
of
the
men
could
not
assist
us
much
beyond
expressing
his
sympathy
and
sending
us
provisions
in
the
winter
of
father
returned
from
ohio
but
as
soon
as
his
old
enemies
learned
that
he
was
with
us
they
again
compelled
him
to
leave
he
proceeded
to
lawrence
and
there
spent
the
winter
in
attending
the
lecompton
legislature
the
remainder
of
the
year
he
passed
mostly
at
grasshopper
falls
where
he
completed
his
he
occasionally
visited
home
under
cover
of
the
night
and
in
the
most
secret
manner
virtually
carrying
his
life
in
his
hand
in
the
spring
of
this
year
a
party
came
to
our
house
to
search
for
father
not
finding
him
they
departed
taking
with
them
my
pony
prince
i
shall
never
forget
the
man
who
stole
that
pony
he
afterwards
rose
from
the
low
level
of
a
horse
thief
to
the
high
dignity
of
a
justice
of
the
peace
and
i
think
still
lives
at
kickapoo
the
loss
of
my
faithful
pony
nearly
broke
my
heart
and
bankrupted
me
in
business
as
i
had
nothing
to
ride
one
day
soon
afterwards
i
met
my
old
friend
russell
to
whom
i
related
all
my
troubles
and
his
generous
heart
was
touched
by
my
story
billy
my
boy
said
he
cheer
up
and
come
to
leavenworth
and
employ
you
i
give
you
dollars
a
month
to
herd
cattle
i
accepted
the
offer
and
heartily
thanking
him
hurried
home
to
obtain
mother
consent
she
refused
to
let
me
go
and
all
my
pleading
was
in
vain
young
as
i
was
being
then
only
in
my
tenth
year
my
ideas
and
knowledge
of
the
world
however
being
far
in
advance
of
my
age
i
determined
to
run
away
from
home
russell
offer
of
dollars
a
month
was
a
temptation
which
i
could
not
resist
the
remuneration
for
my
services
seemed
very
large
to
me
and
i
accordingly
stole
away
and
walked
to
leavenworth
badger
one
of
russell
superintendents
immediately
sent
me
out
mounted
on
a
little
gray
mule
to
herd
cattle
i
worked
at
this
for
two
months
and
then
came
into
leavenworth
i
had
not
been
home
during
all
this
time
but
mother
had
learned
from
russell
where
i
was
and
she
no
longer
felt
uneasy
as
he
had
advised
her
to
let
me
remain
in
his
employ
he
assured
her
that
i
was
all
right
and
said
that
when
the
herd
came
in
he
would
allow
me
to
make
a
visit
home
upon
my
arrival
in
leavenworth
with
the
herd
of
cattle
russell
instructed
his
byers
to
pay
me
my
wages
amounting
to
fifty
dollars
byers
gave
me
the
sum
all
in
pieces
i
put
the
bright
silver
coins
into
a
sack
which
i
tied
to
my
mule
and
started
home
thinking
myself
a
this
money
i
gave
to
mother
who
had
already
forgiven
me
for
running
away
thus
began
my
service
for
the
firm
of
russell
majors
afterwards
russell
majors
waddell
with
whom
i
spent
seven
years
of
my
life
in
different
capacities
such
as
pony
express
rider
and
driver
i
continued
to
work
for
russell
during
the
rest
of
the
summer
of
and
in
the
winter
of
i
attended
school
father
who
still
continued
to
secretly
visit
home
was
anxious
to
have
his
children
receive
as
much
of
an
education
as
possible
under
the
adverse
circumstances
surrounding
us
and
he
employed
a
teacher
miss
jennie
lyons
to
come
to
our
house
and
teach
my
mother
was
well
educated
more
so
than
my
father
and
it
used
to
worry
her
a
great
deal
because
her
children
could
not
receive
better
educational
advantages
however
the
little
school
at
home
got
along
exceedingly
well
and
we
all
made
rapid
advances
in
our
studies
as
miss
lyons
was
an
excellent
teacher
she
afterwards
married
a
gentleman
named
hook
who
became
the
first
mayor
of
cheyenne
where
she
now
lives
the
kansas
troubles
reached
their
highest
pitch
in
the
spring
of
and
our
family
continued
to
be
harassed
as
much
as
ever
by
our
old
enemies
i
can
not
now
recollect
of
the
serious
difficulties
that
we
had
to
encounter
but
i
very
distinctly
remember
one
incident
well
worth
relating
i
came
home
one
night
on
a
visit
from
leavenworth
being
accompanied
by
a
a
young
man
during
the
night
we
heard
a
noise
outside
of
the
house
and
soon
the
dogs
began
barking
loudly
we
looked
out
to
ascertain
the
cause
of
the
disturbance
and
saw
that
the
house
was
surrounded
by
a
party
of
men
mother
had
become
accustomed
to
such
occurrences
and
on
this
occasion
she
seemed
to
be
master
of
the
situation
from
the
start
opening
a
window
she
coolly
sang
out
in
a
firm
tone
of
voice
who
are
you
what
do
you
want
here
we
are
after
that
old
abolition
husband
of
yours
was
the
answer
from
one
of
the
crowd
he
is
not
in
this
house
and
has
not
been
here
for
a
long
time
said
my
mother
that
a
lie
we
know
he
is
in
the
house
and
we
are
bound
to
have
him
said
the
spokesman
of
the
party
i
afterwards
learned
they
had
mistaken
the
herder
who
had
ridden
home
with
me
for
my
father
for
whom
they
had
been
watching
my
husband
is
not
at
home
emphatically
repeated
my
heroic
mother
for
if
there
ever
was
a
heroine
she
certainly
was
one
but
the
house
is
full
of
armed
men
continued
she
and
i
give
you
just
two
minutes
to
get
out
of
the
yard
if
you
are
not
out
by
the
end
of
that
time
i
shall
order
them
to
fire
on
you
she
withdrew
from
the
window
for
a
few
moments
and
hurriedly
instructed
the
herder
to
call
aloud
certain
names
any
that
he
might
think
of
just
as
if
the
house
was
full
of
men
to
whom
he
was
giving
orders
he
followed
her
directions
to
the
very
letter
he
could
not
have
done
it
any
better
had
he
rehearsed
the
act
a
dozen
times
the
party
outside
heard
him
as
it
was
intended
they
should
and
they
supposed
that
my
mother
really
had
quite
a
force
at
her
command
while
this
little
by
play
was
being
enacted
she
stepped
to
the
open
window
again
and
said
john
green
you
and
your
friends
had
better
go
away
or
the
men
will
surely
fire
on
you
at
this
point
the
herder
myself
and
my
sisters
commenced
stamping
on
the
floor
in
imitation
of
a
squad
of
soldiers
and
the
herder
issued
his
orders
in
a
loud
voice
to
his
imaginary
troops
who
were
apparently
approaching
the
window
preparatory
to
firing
a
volley
at
the
enemy
this
little
stratagem
proved
eminently
successful
the
cowardly
villains
began
retreating
and
then
my
mother
fired
an
old
gun
into
the
air
which
greatly
accelerated
their
speed
causing
them
to
break
and
run
they
soon
disappeared
from
view
in
the
darkness
the
next
morning
we
accidentally
discovered
that
they
had
intended
to
blow
up
the
house
upon
going
into
the
cellar
which
had
been
left
open
on
one
side
we
found
two
kegs
of
powder
together
with
a
fuse
secreted
there
it
only
required
a
lighted
match
to
have
sent
us
into
eternity
my
mother
presence
of
mind
which
had
never
yet
deserted
her
in
any
trying
situation
had
saved
our
lives
shortly
after
this
affair
i
came
home
again
on
a
visit
and
found
father
there
sick
with
fever
and
confined
to
his
bed
one
day
my
old
enemy
rode
up
to
the
house
on
my
pony
prince
which
he
had
stolen
from
me
what
is
your
business
here
asked
mother
i
am
looking
for
the
old
man
he
replied
i
am
going
to
search
the
house
and
if
i
find
him
i
am
going
to
kill
him
here
you
girls
said
he
addressing
my
sisters
get
me
some
dinner
and
get
it
quick
too
for
i
am
as
hungry
as
a
wolf
very
well
pray
be
seated
and
we
get
you
something
to
eat
said
one
of
my
sisters
without
exhibiting
the
least
sign
of
fear
he
sat
down
and
while
they
were
preparing
a
dinner
for
him
he
took
out
a
big
knife
and
sharpened
it
on
a
whetstone
repeating
his
threat
of
searching
the
house
and
killing
my
father
i
had
witnessed
the
whole
proceeding
and
heard
the
threats
and
i
determined
that
the
man
should
never
go
up
stairs
where
father
was
lying
in
bed
unable
to
rise
taking
a
pistol
which
i
had
recently
bought
i
went
to
the
head
of
the
stairs
cocked
the
weapon
and
waited
for
the
ruffian
to
come
up
determined
that
the
moment
he
set
foot
on
the
steps
i
would
kill
him
i
was
relieved
however
from
the
stern
necessity
as
he
did
not
make
his
appearance
the
brute
was
considerably
intoxicated
when
he
came
to
the
house
and
the
longer
he
sat
still
the
more
his
brain
became
muddled
with
liquor
and
he
actually
forgot
what
he
had
come
there
for
after
he
had
eaten
his
dinner
he
mounted
his
horse
and
rode
off
and
it
was
a
fortunate
thing
for
him
that
he
did
father
soon
recovered
and
returned
to
grasshopper
falls
while
i
resumed
my
cattle
herding
chapter
iv
youthful
experiences
in
july
the
people
living
in
the
vicinity
of
our
home
feeling
the
necessity
of
more
extensive
educational
facilities
for
their
children
than
they
had
yet
had
started
a
subscription
school
in
a
little
log
cabin
on
the
bank
of
the
creek
which
for
a
while
proved
quite
a
success
my
mother
being
very
anxious
to
have
me
attend
this
school
i
acceded
to
her
wishes
and
returning
home
i
became
a
pupil
of
the
institution
i
made
considerable
progress
in
my
studies
such
as
they
were
and
was
getting
along
very
well
in
every
other
respect
until
i
became
involved
in
my
first
love
affair
like
all
i
had
a
sweetheart
with
whom
i
was
dead
in
love
in
a
juvenile
way
her
name
was
mary
hyatt
of
course
i
had
a
rival
stephen
gobel
a
boy
about
three
years
my
senior
the
bully
of
the
school
he
was
terribly
jealous
and
sought
in
every
way
to
revenge
himself
upon
me
for
having
won
the
childish
affections
of
sweet
little
mary
the
boys
of
the
school
used
to
build
or
arbors
among
the
trees
and
bushes
for
their
sweethearts
i
had
built
a
for
mary
when
steve
as
we
called
him
leveled
it
to
the
ground
we
immediately
had
a
very
lively
fight
in
which
i
got
badly
beaten
the
teacher
heard
of
our
quarrel
and
whipped
us
both
this
made
matters
worse
than
ever
as
i
had
received
two
thrashings
to
steve
one
i
smothered
my
angry
feelings
as
much
as
possible
under
the
humiliating
circumstances
and
during
the
afternoon
recess
built
another
thinking
that
gobel
would
not
dare
to
destroy
a
second
one
but
i
was
mistaken
for
he
pushed
the
whole
structure
over
at
the
first
opportunity
i
came
up
to
him
just
as
he
finished
the
job
and
said
steve
gobel
the
next
time
you
do
that
i
hurt
you
and
i
meant
it
too
but
he
laughed
and
called
me
names
illustration
two
to
one
at
recess
next
morning
i
began
the
construction
of
still
another
playhouse
and
when
i
had
it
about
finished
steve
slyly
sneaked
up
to
the
spot
and
tipped
the
whole
thing
over
i
jumped
for
him
with
the
quickness
of
a
cat
and
clutching
him
by
the
throat
for
a
moment
i
had
the
advantage
of
him
but
he
was
too
strong
for
me
and
soon
had
me
on
the
ground
and
was
beating
me
severely
while
away
from
home
i
had
someway
come
into
possession
of
a
very
small
pocket
dagger
which
i
had
carried
about
with
me
in
its
sheath
using
it
in
place
of
a
knife
during
the
struggle
this
fell
from
my
pocket
and
my
hand
by
accident
rested
upon
it
as
it
lay
upon
the
ground
exasperated
beyond
measure
at
persistence
in
destroying
my
and
smarting
under
his
blows
i
forgot
myself
for
the
moment
grasped
the
dagger
and
unthinkingly
thrust
it
into
steve
thigh
had
it
been
larger
it
would
probably
have
injured
him
severely
as
it
was
it
made
a
small
wound
sufficient
to
cause
the
blood
to
flow
freely
and
steve
to
cry
out
in
affright
i
am
killed
o
i
am
killed
the
school
children
all
rushed
to
the
spot
and
were
terrified
at
the
scene
what
the
matter
asked
one
bill
cody
has
killed
steve
gobel
replied
another
the
uproar
reached
the
teacher
ear
and
i
now
saw
him
approaching
with
vengeance
in
his
eye
and
a
big
club
in
his
hand
i
knew
that
he
was
coming
to
interview
i
was
dreadfully
frightened
at
what
i
had
done
and
undecided
whether
to
run
away
or
to
remain
and
take
the
consequences
but
the
sight
of
that
in
the
school
teacher
hand
was
too
much
for
me
i
no
longer
hesitated
but
started
off
like
a
deer
the
teacher
followed
in
hot
pursuit
but
soon
became
convinced
that
he
could
not
catch
me
and
gave
up
the
chase
i
kept
on
running
until
i
reached
one
of
russell
major
waddell
freight
trains
which
i
had
noticed
going
over
the
hill
for
the
west
fortunately
for
me
i
knew
the
john
willis
and
as
soon
as
i
recovered
my
breath
i
told
him
what
had
happened
served
him
right
billy
said
he
and
what
more
we
go
over
and
clean
out
the
teacher
oh
no
do
do
that
said
i
for
i
was
afraid
that
i
might
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
wounded
boy
friends
who
i
knew
would
soon
be
looking
for
me
well
billy
come
along
with
me
i
am
bound
for
fort
kearney
the
trip
will
take
me
forty
days
i
want
you
for
a
cavallard
driver
all
right
i
replied
but
i
must
go
home
and
tell
mother
about
it
and
get
some
clothes
well
then
after
we
make
our
camp
i
go
back
with
you
the
affray
broke
up
the
school
for
the
rest
of
the
day
as
the
excitement
was
too
much
for
the
children
late
in
the
afternoon
after
the
train
had
moved
on
some
considerable
distance
i
saw
steve
father
his
brother
frank
and
one
of
the
neighbors
rapidly
approaching
willis
there
comes
old
gobel
with
frank
and
somebody
else
and
they
are
after
me
what
am
i
going
to
do
i
asked
let
come
said
he
they
ca
take
you
if
i
got
anything
to
say
about
it
and
i
rather
think
i
have
get
into
one
of
the
wagons
keep
quiet
and
lay
low
i
manage
this
little
job
do
you
fret
a
bit
about
it
i
obeyed
his
orders
and
felt
much
easier
old
gobel
frank
and
the
neighbor
soon
came
up
and
inquired
for
me
he
around
here
somewhere
said
willis
we
want
him
said
gobel
he
stabbed
my
son
a
little
while
ago
and
i
want
to
arrest
him
well
you
ca
get
him
that
settles
it
so
you
need
waste
any
of
your
time
around
here
said
willis
gobel
continued
to
talk
for
a
few
minutes
but
getting
no
greater
satisfaction
the
trio
returned
home
when
night
came
willis
accompanied
me
on
horseback
to
my
home
mother
who
had
anxiously
searched
for
me
everywhere
being
afraid
that
something
had
befallen
me
at
the
hands
of
the
gobels
was
delighted
to
see
me
notwithstanding
the
difficulty
in
which
i
had
become
involved
i
at
once
told
her
that
at
present
i
was
afraid
to
remain
at
home
and
had
accordingly
made
up
my
mind
to
absent
myself
for
a
few
weeks
or
months
at
least
until
the
excitement
should
die
out
willis
said
to
her
that
he
would
take
me
to
fort
kearney
with
him
and
see
that
i
was
properly
cared
for
and
would
bring
me
back
safely
in
forty
days
mother
at
first
seriously
objected
to
my
going
on
this
trip
fearing
i
would
fall
into
the
hands
of
indians
her
fears
however
were
soon
overcome
and
she
concluded
to
let
me
go
she
fixed
me
up
a
big
bundle
of
clothing
and
gave
me
a
quilt
kissing
her
and
my
sisters
a
fond
farewell
i
started
off
on
my
first
trip
across
the
plains
and
with
a
light
heart
too
notwithstanding
my
trouble
of
a
few
hours
before
the
trip
proved
a
most
enjoyable
one
to
me
although
no
incidents
worthy
of
note
occurred
on
the
way
on
my
return
from
fort
kearney
i
was
paid
off
the
same
as
the
rest
of
the
employees
the
remainder
of
the
summer
and
fall
i
spent
in
herding
cattle
and
working
for
russell
majors
waddell
i
finally
ventured
home
not
without
some
fear
however
of
the
gobel
family
and
was
delighted
to
learn
that
during
my
absence
mother
had
had
an
interview
with
gobel
and
having
settled
the
difficulty
with
him
the
two
families
had
become
friends
again
and
i
may
state
incidentally
that
they
ever
after
remained
so
i
have
since
often
met
stephen
gobel
and
we
have
had
many
a
laugh
together
over
our
love
affair
and
the
affray
at
the
mary
hyatt
the
innocent
cause
of
the
whole
difficulty
is
now
married
and
living
in
chicago
thus
ended
my
first
love
scrape
in
the
winter
of
my
father
in
company
with
a
man
named
boles
went
to
cleveland
ohio
and
organized
a
colony
of
about
thirty
families
whom
they
brought
to
kansas
and
located
on
the
grasshopper
several
of
these
families
still
reside
there
it
was
during
this
winter
that
father
after
his
return
from
cleveland
caught
a
severe
cold
this
in
connection
with
the
wound
he
had
received
at
rively
from
which
he
had
never
entirely
recovered
affected
him
seriously
and
in
april
he
died
at
home
from
kidney
disease
this
sad
event
left
my
mother
and
the
family
in
poor
circumstances
and
i
determined
to
follow
the
plains
for
a
livelihood
for
them
and
myself
i
had
no
difficulty
in
obtaining
work
under
my
old
employers
and
in
may
i
started
for
salt
lake
city
with
a
herd
of
beef
cattle
in
charge
of
frank
and
bill
mccarthy
for
general
albert
sidney
johnson
army
which
was
then
being
sent
across
the
plains
to
fight
the
mormons
nothing
occurred
to
interrupt
our
journey
until
we
reached
plum
creek
on
the
south
platte
river
miles
west
of
old
fort
kearney
we
had
made
a
morning
drive
and
had
camped
for
dinner
the
and
a
majority
of
the
men
had
gone
to
sleep
under
the
mess
wagons
the
cattle
were
being
guarded
by
three
men
and
the
cook
was
preparing
dinner
no
one
had
any
idea
that
indians
were
anywhere
near
us
the
first
warning
we
had
that
they
were
infesting
that
part
of
the
country
was
the
firing
of
shots
and
the
whoops
and
yells
from
a
party
of
them
who
catching
us
napping
gave
us
a
most
unwelcome
surprise
all
the
men
jumped
to
their
feet
and
seized
their
guns
they
saw
with
astonishment
the
cattle
running
in
every
direction
they
having
been
stampeded
by
the
indians
who
had
shot
and
killed
the
three
men
who
were
on
duty
and
the
red
devils
were
now
charging
down
upon
the
rest
of
us
i
then
thought
of
mother
fears
of
my
falling
into
the
hands
of
the
indians
and
i
had
about
made
up
my
mind
that
such
was
to
be
my
fate
but
when
i
saw
how
coolly
and
determinedly
the
mccarthy
brothers
were
conducting
themselves
and
giving
orders
to
the
little
band
i
became
convinced
that
we
would
stand
the
indians
off
as
the
saying
is
our
men
were
all
well
armed
with
colt
revolvers
and
mississippi
yagers
which
last
carried
a
bullet
and
two
buckshots
the
mccarthy
boys
at
the
proper
moment
gave
orders
to
fire
upon
the
advancing
enemy
the
volley
checked
them
although
they
returned
the
compliment
and
shot
one
of
our
party
through
the
leg
frank
mccarthy
then
sang
out
boys
make
a
break
for
the
slough
yonder
and
we
can
then
have
the
bank
for
a
illustration
killing
my
first
indian
we
made
a
run
for
the
slough
which
was
only
a
short
distance
off
and
succeeded
in
safely
reaching
it
bringing
with
us
the
wounded
man
the
bank
proved
to
be
a
very
effective
affording
us
good
protection
we
had
been
there
but
a
short
time
when
frank
mccarthy
seeing
that
the
longer
we
were
corraled
the
worse
it
would
be
for
us
said
well
boys
we
try
to
make
our
way
back
to
fort
kearney
by
wading
in
the
river
and
keeping
the
bank
for
a
we
all
agreed
that
this
was
the
best
plan
and
we
accordingly
proceeded
down
the
river
several
miles
in
this
way
managing
to
keep
the
indians
at
a
safe
distance
with
our
guns
until
the
slough
made
a
junction
with
the
main
platte
river
from
there
down
we
found
the
river
at
times
quite
deep
and
in
order
to
carry
the
wounded
man
along
with
us
we
constructed
a
raft
of
poles
for
his
accommodation
and
in
this
way
he
was
transported
occasionally
the
water
would
be
too
deep
for
us
to
wade
and
we
were
obliged
to
put
our
weapons
on
the
raft
and
swim
the
indians
followed
us
pretty
close
and
were
continually
watching
for
an
opportunity
to
get
a
good
range
and
give
us
a
raking
fire
covering
ourselves
by
keeping
well
under
the
bank
we
pushed
ahead
as
rapidly
as
possible
and
made
pretty
good
progress
the
night
finding
us
still
on
the
way
and
our
enemies
still
on
our
track
i
being
the
youngest
and
smallest
of
the
party
became
somewhat
tired
and
without
noticing
it
i
had
fallen
behind
the
others
for
some
little
distance
it
was
about
ten
and
we
were
keeping
very
quiet
and
hugging
close
to
the
bank
when
i
happened
to
look
up
to
the
sky
and
saw
the
plumed
head
of
an
indian
peeping
over
the
bank
instead
of
hurrying
ahead
and
alarming
the
men
in
a
quiet
way
i
instantly
aimed
my
gun
at
the
head
and
fired
the
report
rang
out
sharp
and
loud
on
the
night
air
and
was
immediately
followed
by
an
indian
whoop
and
the
next
moment
about
six
feet
of
dead
indian
came
tumbling
into
the
river
i
was
not
only
overcome
with
astonishment
but
was
badly
scared
as
i
could
hardly
realize
what
i
had
done
i
expected
to
see
the
whole
force
of
indians
come
down
upon
us
while
i
was
standing
thus
bewildered
the
men
who
had
heard
the
shot
and
the
and
had
seen
the
indian
take
a
tumble
came
rushing
back
who
fired
that
shot
cried
frank
mccarthy
i
did
replied
i
rather
proudly
as
my
confidence
returned
and
i
saw
the
men
coming
up
yes
and
little
billy
has
killed
an
indian
too
dead
to
skin
said
one
of
the
men
who
had
approached
nearer
than
the
rest
and
had
almost
stumbled
upon
the
corpse
from
that
time
forward
i
became
a
hero
and
an
indian
killer
this
was
of
course
the
first
indian
i
had
ever
shot
and
as
i
was
not
then
more
than
eleven
years
of
age
my
exploit
created
quite
a
sensation
the
other
indians
upon
learning
what
had
happened
to
their
advance
guard
set
up
a
terrible
howling
and
fired
several
volleys
at
us
but
without
doing
any
injury
as
we
were
so
well
protected
by
the
bank
we
resumed
our
journey
down
the
river
and
traveled
all
night
long
just
before
daylight
frank
mccarthy
crawled
out
over
the
bank
and
discovered
that
we
were
only
five
miles
from
fort
kearney
which
post
we
reached
in
safety
in
about
two
hours
shortly
after
bringing
the
wounded
man
with
us
it
was
indeed
a
relief
to
us
all
to
feel
that
once
more
we
were
safe
frank
mccarthy
immediately
reported
to
the
commanding
officer
and
informed
him
of
all
that
had
happened
the
commandant
at
once
ordered
a
company
of
cavalry
and
one
of
infantry
to
proceed
to
plum
creek
on
a
forced
march
taking
a
howitzer
with
them
to
endeavor
to
recapture
the
cattle
from
the
indians
the
firm
of
russell
majors
waddell
had
a
division
agent
at
kearney
and
this
agent
mounted
us
on
mules
so
that
we
could
accompany
the
troops
on
reaching
the
place
where
the
indians
had
surprised
us
we
found
the
bodies
of
the
three
men
whom
they
had
killed
and
scalped
and
literally
cut
into
pieces
we
of
course
buried
the
remains
we
caught
but
few
of
the
cattle
the
most
of
them
having
been
driven
off
and
stampeded
with
the
buffaloes
there
being
numerous
immense
herds
of
the
latter
in
that
section
of
the
country
at
that
time
the
indian
trail
was
discovered
running
south
towards
the
republican
river
and
the
troops
followed
it
to
the
head
of
plum
creek
and
there
abandoned
it
returning
to
fort
kearney
without
having
seen
a
single
the
company
agent
seeing
that
there
was
no
further
use
for
us
in
that
vicinity
as
we
had
lost
our
cattle
and
mules
sent
us
back
to
fort
leavenworth
the
company
it
is
proper
to
state
did
not
have
to
stand
the
loss
of
the
expedition
as
the
government
held
itself
responsible
for
such
depredations
by
the
indians
on
the
day
that
i
got
into
leavenworth
sometime
in
july
i
was
interviewed
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
by
a
newspaper
reporter
and
the
next
morning
i
found
my
name
in
print
as
the
youngest
indian
slayer
on
the
plains
i
am
candid
enough
to
admit
that
i
felt
very
much
elated
over
this
notoriety
again
and
again
i
read
with
eager
interest
the
long
and
sensational
account
of
our
adventure
my
exploit
was
related
in
a
very
graphic
manner
and
for
a
long
time
afterwards
i
was
considerable
of
a
hero
the
reporter
who
had
thus
set
me
up
as
i
then
thought
on
the
highest
pinnacle
of
fame
was
john
hutchinson
and
i
felt
very
grateful
to
him
he
now
lives
in
wichita
kansas
chapter
in
business
in
the
summer
of
russell
majors
waddell
were
sending
a
great
many
trains
across
the
plains
to
salt
lake
with
supplies
for
general
johnston
army
men
were
in
great
demand
and
the
company
was
paying
teamsters
forty
dollars
per
month
in
gold
an
old
and
reliable
named
lewis
simpson
who
had
taken
a
great
fancy
to
me
and
who
by
the
way
was
one
of
the
best
that
ever
ran
a
bull
train
was
loading
a
train
for
the
company
and
was
about
to
start
out
with
it
for
salt
lake
he
asked
me
to
go
along
as
an
extra
hand
the
high
wages
that
were
being
paid
were
a
great
inducement
to
me
and
the
position
of
an
extra
hand
was
a
pleasant
one
all
that
i
would
have
to
do
would
be
to
take
the
place
of
any
man
who
became
sick
and
drive
his
wagon
until
he
recovered
i
would
have
my
own
mule
to
ride
and
to
a
certain
extent
i
would
be
a
minor
boss
my
mother
was
very
much
opposed
to
my
taking
this
long
trip
as
i
would
be
absent
nearly
a
year
and
there
was
a
possibility
that
something
might
arise
to
prevent
me
from
ever
coming
back
as
we
could
not
often
tell
how
the
mormon
difficulty
would
terminate
then
again
owing
to
the
indians
a
journey
over
the
plains
in
those
days
was
a
perilous
undertaking
she
said
that
as
i
had
recently
returned
from
the
plains
and
had
had
a
narrow
escape
from
death
at
the
hands
of
the
indians
she
did
not
want
me
to
risk
my
life
a
second
time
i
told
her
that
inasmuch
as
i
had
determined
to
follow
the
plains
for
an
occupation
nothing
could
now
stop
me
from
going
on
this
trip
and
if
it
became
necessary
i
would
run
away
seeing
that
it
was
impossible
to
keep
me
at
home
she
reluctantly
gave
her
consent
but
not
until
she
had
called
upon
russell
and
simpson
in
regard
to
the
matter
and
had
obtained
from
the
latter
gentleman
his
promise
that
i
should
be
well
taken
care
of
if
we
had
to
winter
in
the
mountains
she
did
not
like
the
appearance
of
simpson
and
upon
inquiry
she
learned
to
her
dismay
that
he
was
a
desperate
character
and
that
on
nearly
every
trip
he
had
made
across
the
plains
he
had
killed
some
one
such
a
man
she
thought
was
not
a
fit
master
or
companion
for
her
son
and
she
was
very
anxious
to
have
me
go
with
some
other
but
i
still
insisted
upon
remaining
with
simpson
madam
i
can
assure
you
that
lew
simpson
is
one
of
the
most
reliable
on
the
plains
said
russell
and
he
has
taken
a
great
fancy
to
billy
if
your
boy
is
bound
to
go
he
can
go
with
no
better
man
no
one
will
dare
to
impose
on
him
while
he
is
with
lew
simpson
whom
i
will
instruct
to
take
good
care
of
the
boy
upon
reaching
fort
laramie
billy
can
if
he
wishes
exchange
places
with
some
fresh
man
coming
back
on
a
returning
train
and
thus
come
home
without
making
the
whole
trip
this
seemed
to
satisfy
mother
and
then
she
had
a
long
talk
with
simpson
himself
imploring
him
not
to
forget
his
promise
to
take
good
care
of
her
precious
boy
he
promised
everything
that
she
asked
thus
after
much
trouble
i
became
one
of
the
members
of
simpson
train
before
taking
our
departure
i
arranged
with
russell
majors
waddell
that
when
my
pay
should
fall
due
it
should
be
paid
over
to
mother
as
a
matter
of
interest
to
the
general
reader
it
may
be
well
in
this
connection
to
give
a
brief
description
of
a
freight
train
the
wagons
used
in
those
days
by
russell
majors
waddell
were
known
as
the
murphy
wagons
made
at
louis
specially
for
the
plains
business
they
were
very
large
and
were
strongly
built
being
capable
of
carrying
seven
thousand
pounds
of
freight
each
the
were
very
commodious
being
as
large
as
the
rooms
of
an
ordinary
house
and
were
covered
with
two
heavy
canvas
sheets
to
protect
the
merchandise
from
the
rain
these
wagons
were
generally
sent
out
from
leavenworth
each
loaded
with
six
thousand
pounds
of
freight
and
each
drawn
by
several
yokes
of
oxen
in
charge
of
one
driver
a
train
consisted
of
wagons
all
in
charge
of
one
man
who
was
known
as
the
the
second
man
in
command
was
the
assistant
then
came
the
extra
hand
next
the
night
herder
and
lastly
the
cavallard
driver
whose
duty
it
was
to
drive
the
lame
and
loose
cattle
there
were
men
all
told
in
a
train
the
men
did
their
own
cooking
being
divided
into
messes
of
seven
one
man
cooked
another
brought
wood
and
water
another
stood
guard
and
so
on
each
having
some
duty
to
perform
while
getting
meals
all
were
heavily
armed
with
colt
pistols
and
mississippi
yagers
and
every
one
always
had
his
weapons
handy
so
as
to
be
prepared
for
any
emergency
the
in
the
language
of
the
plains
was
called
the
boss
the
teamsters
were
known
as
and
the
whole
train
was
denominated
a
everything
at
that
time
was
called
an
outfit
the
men
of
the
plains
were
always
full
of
droll
humor
and
exciting
stories
of
their
own
experiences
and
many
an
hour
i
spent
in
listening
to
the
recitals
of
thrilling
adventures
and
escapes
russell
majors
waddell
had
in
their
employ
two
hundred
and
fifty
trains
composed
of
wagons
oxen
and
about
eight
thousand
men
their
business
reaching
to
all
the
government
frontier
posts
in
the
north
and
west
to
which
they
transported
supplies
and
they
also
carried
freight
as
far
south
as

illustration
a
prairie
schooner
the
trail
to
salt
lake
ran
through
kansas
to
the
northwest
crossing
the
big
blue
river
then
over
the
big
and
little
sandy
coming
into
nebraska
near
the
big
sandy
the
next
stream
of
any
importance
was
the
little
blue
along
which
the
trail
ran
for
sixty
miles
then
crossed
a
range
of
and
struck
the
platte
river
ten
miles
below
old
fort
kearney
thence
the
course
lay
up
the
south
platte
to
the
old
ash
hollow
crossing
thence
eighteen
miles
across
to
the
north
platte
near
the
mouth
of
the
blue
water
where
general
harney
had
his
great
battle
in
with
the
sioux
and
cheyenne
indians
from
this
point
the
north
platte
was
followed
passing
court
house
rock
chimney
rock
and
scott
bluffs
and
then
on
to
fort
laramie
where
the
laramie
river
was
crossed
still
following
the
north
platte
for
some
considerable
distance
the
trail
crossed
this
river
at
old
richard
bridge
and
followed
it
up
to
the
celebrated
red
buttes
crossing
the
willow
creeks
to
the
sweet
water
passing
the
great
independence
rock
and
the
devil
gate
up
to
the
three
crossings
of
the
sweet
water
thence
past
the
cold
springs
where
three
feet
under
the
sod
on
the
hottest
day
of
summer
ice
can
be
found
thence
to
the
hot
springs
and
the
rocky
ridge
and
through
the
rocky
mountains
and
echo
cañon
and
thence
on
to
the
great
salt
lake
valley
we
had
started
on
our
trip
with
everything
in
good
shape
following
the
above
described
trail
during
the
first
week
or
two
out
i
became
well
acquainted
with
most
of
the
train
men
and
with
one
in
particular
who
became
a
and
intimate
friend
of
mine
his
real
name
was
james
hickok
he
afterwards
became
famous
as
wild
bill
the
scout
of
the
plains
though
why
he
was
so
called
i
never
could
ascertain
and
from
this
time
forward
i
shall
refer
to
him
by
his
popular
nickname
he
was
ten
years
my
senior
a
tall
handsome
magnificently
built
and
powerful
young
fellow
who
could
and
any
man
in
the
train
he
was
generally
admitted
to
be
the
best
man
physically
in
the
employ
of
russell
majors
waddell
and
of
his
bravery
there
was
not
a
doubt
general
custer
in
his
life
on
the
plains
thus
speaks
of
wild
bill
among
the
white
scouts
were
numbered
some
of
the
most
noted
of
their
class
the
most
prominent
man
among
them
was
bill
whose
highly
varied
career
was
made
the
subject
of
an
illustrated
sketch
in
one
of
the
popular
monthly
periodicals
a
few
years
ago
bill
was
a
strange
character
just
the
one
which
a
novelist
might
gloat
over
he
was
a
in
every
sense
of
the
word
yet
unlike
any
other
of
his
class
in
person
he
was
about
six
feet
and
one
inch
in
height
straight
as
the
straightest
of
the
warriors
whose
implacable
foe
he
was
he
had
broad
shoulders
chest
and
limbs
and
a
face
strikingly
handsome
a
sharp
clear
blue
eye
which
stared
you
straight
in
the
face
when
in
conversation
a
finely
shaped
nose
inclined
to
be
aquiline
a
mouth
with
lips
only
partially
concealed
by
a
handsome
moustache
his
hair
and
complexion
were
those
of
the
perfect
blonde
the
former
was
worn
in
uncut
ringlets
falling
carelessly
over
his
powerfully
formed
shoulders
add
to
this
figure
a
costume
blending
the
immaculate
neatness
of
the
dandy
with
the
extravagant
taste
and
style
of
the
frontiersman
and
you
have
wild
bill
whether
on
foot
or
on
horseback
he
was
one
of
the
most
perfect
types
of
physical
manhood
i
ever
saw
of
his
courage
there
could
be
no
question
it
had
been
brought
to
the
test
on
too
many
occasions
to
admit
of
a
doubt
his
skill
in
the
use
of
the
pistol
and
rifle
was
unerring
while
his
deportment
was
exactly
the
opposite
of
what
might
be
expected
from
a
man
of
his
surroundings
it
was
entirely
free
from
all
bluster
or
bravado
he
seldom
spoke
himself
unless
requested
to
do
so
his
conversation
strange
to
say
never
bordered
either
on
the
vulgar
or
blasphemous
his
influence
among
the
frontiersmen
was
unbounded
his
word
was
law
and
many
are
the
personal
quarrels
and
disturbances
which
he
has
checked
among
his
comrades
by
his
simple
announcement
that
has
gone
far
enough
if
need
be
followed
by
the
ominous
warning
that
when
persisted
in
or
renewed
the
quarreler
settle
it
with
me
wild
bill
was
anything
but
a
quarrelsome
man
yet
no
one
but
him
could
enumerate
the
many
conflicts
in
which
he
had
been
engaged
and
which
had
almost
always
resulted
in
the
death
of
his
adversary
i
have
a
personal
knowledge
of
at
least
half
a
dozen
men
whom
he
had
at
various
times
killed
one
of
these
being
at
the
time
a
member
of
my
command
others
had
been
severely
wounded
yet
he
always
escaped
unhurt
on
the
plains
every
man
openly
carries
his
belt
with
its
invariable
appendages
knife
and
revolver
often
two
of
the
latter
wild
bill
always
carried
two
handsome
revolvers
of
the
large
size
he
was
never
seen
without
them
yet
in
all
the
many
affairs
of
this
kind
in
which
wild
bill
has
performed
a
part
and
which
have
come
to
my
knowledge
there
was
not
a
single
instance
in
which
the
verdict
of
twelve
men
would
not
have
been
pronounced
in
his
favor
illustration
wild
bill
such
is
the
faithful
picture
of
wild
bill
as
drawn
by
general
custer
who
was
a
close
observer
and
student
of
personal
character
and
under
whom
wild
bill
served
as
a
scout
the
circumstances
under
which
i
first
made
his
acquaintance
and
learned
to
know
him
well
and
to
appreciate
his
manly
character
and
were
these
one
of
the
teamsters
in
lew
train
was
a
surly
overbearing
fellow
and
took
particular
delight
in
bullying
and
tyrannizing
over
me
and
one
day
while
we
were
at
dinner
he
asked
me
to
do
something
for
him
i
did
not
start
at
once
and
he
gave
me
a
slap
in
the
face
with
the
back
of
his
hand
knocking
me
off
an
on
which
i
was
sitting
and
sending
me
sprawling
on
the
ground
jumping
to
my
feet
i
picked
up
a
camp
kettle
full
of
boiling
coffee
which
was
setting
on
the
fire
and
threw
it
at
him
i
hit
him
in
the
face
and
the
hot
coffee
gave
him
a
severe
scalding
he
sprang
for
me
with
the
ferocity
of
a
tiger
and
would
undoubtedly
have
torn
me
to
pieces
had
it
not
been
for
the
timely
interference
of
my
friend
wild
bill
who
knocked
the
man
down
as
soon
as
he
recovered
himself
he
demanded
of
wild
bill
what
business
it
was
of
his
that
he
should
put
in
his
oar
it
my
business
to
protect
that
boy
or
anybody
else
from
being
unmercifully
abused
kicked
and
cuffed
and
i
whip
any
man
who
tries
it
on
said
wild
bill
and
if
you
ever
again
lay
a
hand
on
that
boy
little
billy
there
i
give
you
such
a
pounding
that
you
wo
get
over
it
for
a
month
of
sundays
from
that
time
forward
wild
bill
was
my
protector
and
intimate
friend
and
the
friendship
thus
begun
continued
until
his
death
nothing
transpired
on
the
trip
to
delay
or
give
us
any
trouble
whatever
until
the
train
struck
the
south
platte
river
one
day
we
camped
on
the
same
ground
where
the
indians
had
surprised
the
cattle
herd
in
charge
of
the
mccarty
brothers
it
was
with
difficulty
that
we
discovered
any
traces
of
anybody
ever
having
camped
there
before
the
only
landmark
being
the
single
grave
now
covered
with
grass
in
which
we
had
buried
the
three
men
who
had
been
killed
the
country
was
alive
with
buffaloes
vast
herds
of
these
monarchs
of
the
plains
were
roaming
all
around
us
and
we
laid
over
one
day
for
a
grand
hunt
besides
killing
quite
a
number
of
buffaloes
and
having
a
day
of
rare
sport
we
captured
ten
or
twelve
head
of
cattle
they
being
a
portion
of
the
herd
which
had
been
stampeded
by
the
indians
two
months
before
the
next
day
we
pulled
out
of
camp
and
the
train
was
strung
out
to
a
considerable
length
along
the
road
which
ran
near
the
foot
of
the
two
miles
from
the
river
between
the
road
and
the
river
we
saw
a
large
herd
of
buffaloes
grazing
quietly
they
having
been
down
to
the
stream
for
a
drink
just
at
this
time
we
observed
a
party
of
returning
californians
coming
from
the
west
they
too
noticed
the
buffalo
herd
and
in
another
moment
they
were
dashing
down
upon
them
urging
their
steeds
to
the
greatest
speed
the
buffalo
herd
stampeded
at
once
and
broke
for
the
hills
so
hotly
were
they
pursued
by
the
hunters
that
about
five
hundred
of
them
rushed
through
our
train
frightening
both
men
and
oxen
some
of
the
wagons
were
turned
clear
round
and
many
of
the
terrified
oxen
attempted
to
run
to
the
hills
with
the
heavy
wagons
attached
to
them
others
turned
around
so
short
that
they
broke
the
wagon
tongues
off
nearly
all
the
teams
got
entangled
in
their
gearing
and
became
wild
and
unruly
so
that
the
perplexed
drivers
were
unable
to
manage
them
the
buffaloes
the
cattle
and
the
drivers
were
soon
running
in
every
direction
and
the
excitement
upset
nearly
everybody
and
everything
many
of
the
cattle
broke
their
yokes
and
stampeded
one
big
buffalo
bull
became
entangled
in
one
of
the
heavy
and
it
is
a
fact
that
in
his
desperate
efforts
to
free
himself
he
not
only
actually
snapped
the
strong
chain
in
two
but
broke
the
to
which
it
was
attached
and
the
last
seen
of
him
he
was
running
towards
the
hills
with
it
hanging
from
his
horns
a
dozen
other
equally
remarkable
incidents
happened
during
the
short
time
that
the
frantic
buffaloes
were
playing
havoc
with
our
train
and
when
they
had
got
through
and
left
us
our
outfit
was
very
badly
crippled
and
scattered
this
caused
us
to
go
into
camp
and
spend
a
day
in
replacing
the
broken
tongues
and
repairing
other
damages
and
gathering
up
our
scattered
the
next
day
we
rolled
out
of
camp
and
proceeded
on
our
way
towards
the
setting
sun
everything
ran
along
smoothly
with
us
from
that
point
until
we
came
within
about
eighteen
miles
of
green
river
in
the
rocky
mountains
where
we
camped
at
noon
at
this
place
we
had
to
drive
our
cattle
about
a
mile
and
a
half
to
a
creek
to
water
them
simpson
his
assistant
george
woods
and
myself
accompanied
by
the
usual
number
of
guards
drove
the
cattle
over
to
the
creek
and
while
on
our
way
back
to
camp
we
suddenly
observed
a
party
of
twenty
horsemen
rapidly
approaching
us
we
were
not
yet
in
view
of
our
wagons
as
a
rise
of
ground
intervened
and
therefore
we
could
not
signal
the
in
case
of
any
unexpected
danger
befalling
us
we
had
no
suspicion
however
that
we
were
about
to
be
trapped
as
the
strangers
were
white
men
when
they
had
come
up
to
us
one
of
the
party
who
evidently
was
the
leader
rode
out
in
front
and
said
how
are
you
mr
simpson
you
got
the
best
of
me
sir
said
simpson
who
did
not
know
him
well
i
rather
think
i
have
coolly
replied
the
stranger
whose
words
conveyed
a
double
meaning
as
we
soon
learned
we
had
all
come
to
a
halt
by
this
time
and
the
strange
horsemen
had
surrounded
us
they
were
all
armed
with
shot
guns
rifles
and
revolvers
we
also
were
armed
with
revolvers
but
we
had
had
no
idea
of
danger
and
these
men
much
to
our
surprise
had
got
the
drop
on
us
and
had
covered
us
with
their
weapons
so
that
we
were
completely
at
their
mercy
the
whole
movement
of
corraling
us
was
done
so
quietly
and
quickly
that
it
was
accomplished
before
we
knew
it
i
trouble
you
for
your
six
shooters
gentlemen
now
said
the
leader
i
give
to
you
in
a
way
you
do
want
replied
simpson
the
next
moment
three
guns
were
leveled
at
simpson
if
you
make
a
move
you
a
dead
man
said
the
leader
simpson
saw
that
he
was
taken
at
a
great
disadvantage
and
thinking
it
advisable
not
to
risk
the
lives
of
the
party
by
any
rash
act
on
his
part
he
said
i
see
now
that
you
have
the
best
of
me
but
who
are
you
anyhow
i
am
joe
smith
was
the
reply
what
the
leader
of
the
danites
asked
simpson
you
are
correct
said
smith
for
he
it
was
yes
said
simpson
i
know
you
now
you
are
a
spying
scoundrel
simpson
had
good
reason
for
calling
him
this
and
applying
to
him
a
much
more
opprobrious
epithet
for
only
a
short
time
before
this
joe
smith
had
visited
our
train
in
the
disguise
of
a
teamster
and
had
remained
with
us
two
days
he
suddenly
disappeared
no
one
knowing
where
he
had
gone
or
why
he
had
come
among
us
but
it
was
all
explained
to
us
now
that
he
had
returned
with
his
mormon
danites
after
they
had
disarmed
us
simpson
asked
well
smith
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
us
ride
back
with
us
and
i
soon
show
you
said
smith
we
had
no
idea
of
the
surprise
which
awaited
us
as
we
came
upon
the
top
of
the
ridge
from
which
we
could
view
our
camp
we
were
astonished
to
see
the
remainder
of
the
train
men
disarmed
and
stationed
in
a
group
and
surrounded
by
another
squad
of
danites
while
other
mormons
were
searching
our
wagons
for
such
articles
as
they
wanted
how
is
this
inquired
simpson
how
did
you
surprise
my
camp
without
a
struggle
i
ca
understand
it
easily
enough
said
smith
your
men
were
all
asleep
under
the
wagons
except
the
cooks
who
saw
us
coming
and
took
us
for
returning
californians
or
emigrants
and
paid
no
attention
to
us
until
we
rode
up
and
surrounded
your
train
with
our
arms
covering
the
men
we
woke
them
up
and
told
them
that
all
they
had
to
do
was
to
walk
out
and
drop
their
pistols
which
they
saw
was
the
best
thing
they
could
do
under
circumstances
over
which
they
had
no
control
and
you
can
just
bet
they
did
it
and
what
do
you
propose
to
do
with
us
now
asked
simpson
i
intend
to
burn
your
train
said
he
you
are
loaded
with
supplies
and
ammunition
for
sidney
johnson
and
as
i
have
no
way
to
convey
the
stuff
to
my
own
people
i
see
that
it
does
not
reach
the
united
states
troops
are
you
going
to
turn
us
adrift
here
asked
simpson
who
was
anxious
to
learn
what
was
to
become
of
himself
and
his
men
no
i
hardly
am
as
bad
as
that
i
give
you
enough
provisions
to
last
you
until
you
can
reach
fort
bridger
replied
smith
and
as
soon
as
your
cooks
can
get
the
stuff
out
of
the
wagons
you
can
start
on
foot
was
the
laconic
inquiry
of
simpson
yes
sir
was
the
equally
short
reply
smith
that
too
rough
on
us
men
put
yourself
in
our
place
and
see
how
you
would
like
it
said
simpson
you
can
well
afford
to
give
us
at
least
one
wagon
and
six
yokes
of
oxen
to
convey
us
and
our
clothing
and
provisions
to
fort
bridger
you
a
brute
if
you
do
do
this
well
said
smith
after
consulting
a
minute
or
two
with
some
of
his
company
i
do
that
much
for
you
the
cattle
and
the
wagon
were
brought
up
according
to
his
orders
and
the
clothing
and
provisions
were
loaded
on
now
you
can
go
said
smith
after
everything
had
been
arranged
joe
smith
i
think
you
are
a
mean
coward
to
set
us
afloat
in
a
hostile
country
without
giving
us
our
arms
said
simpson
who
had
once
before
asked
for
the
weapons
and
had
had
his
request
denied
smith
after
further
consultation
with
his
comrades
said
simpson
you
are
too
brave
a
man
to
be
turned
adrift
here
without
any
means
of
defense
you
shall
have
your
revolvers
and
guns
our
weapons
were
accordingly
handed
over
to
simpson
and
we
at
once
started
for
fort
bridger
knowing
that
it
would
be
useless
to
attempt
the
recapture
of
our
train
when
we
had
traveled
about
two
miles
we
saw
the
smoke
arising
from
our
old
camp
the
mormons
after
taking
what
goods
they
wanted
and
could
carry
off
had
set
fire
to
the
wagons
many
of
which
were
loaded
with
bacon
lard
and
other
provisions
which
made
a
very
hot
fierce
fire
and
the
smoke
to
roll
up
in
dense
clouds
some
of
the
wagons
were
loaded
with
ammunition
and
it
was
not
long
before
loud
explosions
followed
in
rapid
succession
we
waited
and
witnessed
the
burning
of
the
train
and
then
pushed
on
to
fort
bridger
arriving
at
this
post
we
learned
that
two
other
trains
had
been
captured
and
destroyed
in
the
same
way
by
the
mormons
this
made
wagon
loads
or
pounds
of
supplies
mostly
provisions
which
never
reached
general
johnson
command
to
which
they
had
been
consigned
chapter
vi
hard
times
as
it
was
getting
very
late
in
the
fall
we
were
compelled
to
winter
at
fort
bridger
and
a
long
tedious
winter
it
was
there
were
a
great
many
troops
there
and
about
four
hundred
of
russell
majors
employees
these
men
were
all
organized
into
militia
companies
which
were
officered
by
the
some
lived
in
tents
others
in
cabins
it
was
known
that
our
supplies
would
run
short
during
the
winter
and
so
all
the
men
at
the
post
were
put
on
rations
to
begin
with
before
long
they
were
reduced
to
rations
and
finally
to
rations
we
were
forced
to
kill
our
poor
cattle
for
beef
they
were
actually
so
poor
that
we
had
to
prop
them
up
to
shoot
them
down
at
last
we
fell
back
on
the
mules
which
were
killed
and
served
up
in
good
style
many
a
poor
unsuspecting
government
mule
passed
in
his
chips
that
winter
in
order
to
keep
the
soldiers
and
from
starvation
it
was
really
a
serious
state
of
affairs
the
wood
for
the
post
was
obtained
from
the
mountains
but
having
no
longer
any
cattle
or
mules
to
transport
it
the
men
were
obliged
to
haul
it
themselves
long
lariats
were
tied
to
the
wagons
and
twenty
men
manning
each
they
were
pulled
to
and
from
the
mountains
notwithstanding
all
these
hardships
the
men
seemed
to
be
contented
and
to
enjoy
themselves
the
winter
finally
passed
away
and
early
in
the
spring
as
soon
as
we
could
travel
the
civil
employees
of
the
government
with
the
teamsters
and
freighters
started
for
the
missouri
river
the
johnson
expedition
having
been
abandoned
on
the
way
down
we
stopped
at
fort
laramie
and
there
met
a
supply
train
bound
westward
of
course
we
all
had
a
square
meal
once
more
consisting
of
hard
tack
bacon
coffee
and
beans
i
can
honestly
say
that
i
thought
it
was
the
best
meal
i
had
ever
eaten
at
least
i
relished
it
more
than
any
other
and
i
think
the
rest
of
the
party
did
the
same
on
leaving
fort
laramie
simpson
was
made
brigade
and
was
put
in
charge
of
two
large
trains
with
about
four
hundred
extra
men
who
were
bound
for
fort
leavenworth
when
we
came
to
ash
hollow
instead
of
taking
the
usual
trail
over
to
the
south
platte
simpson
concluded
to
follow
the
north
platte
down
to
its
junction
with
the
south
platte
the
two
trains
were
traveling
about
fifteen
miles
apart
when
one
morning
while
simpson
was
with
the
rear
train
he
told
his
assistant
george
woods
and
myself
to
saddle
up
our
mules
as
he
wanted
us
to
go
with
him
and
overtake
the
head
train
we
started
off
at
about
eleven
and
had
ridden
about
seven
miles
when
while
we
were
on
a
big
plateau
back
of
cedar
bluffs
we
suddenly
discovered
a
band
of
indians
coming
out
of
the
head
of
a
ravine
half
a
mile
distant
and
charging
down
upon
us
at
full
speed
i
thought
that
our
end
had
come
this
time
sure
simpson
however
took
in
the
situation
in
a
moment
and
knowing
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
escape
by
running
our
mules
he
adopted
a
bolder
and
much
better
plan
he
jumped
from
his
own
mule
and
told
us
to
dismount
also
he
then
shot
the
three
animals
and
as
they
fell
to
the
ground
he
cut
their
throats
to
stop
their
kicking
he
then
jerked
them
into
the
shape
of
a
triangle
and
ordered
us
inside
of
the
barricade
all
this
was
but
the
work
of
a
few
moments
yet
it
was
not
done
any
too
soon
for
the
indians
had
got
within
three
hundred
yards
of
us
and
were
still
advancing
and
uttering
their
demoniacal
yells
or
there
were
forty
of
the
and
only
three
of
us
we
were
each
armed
with
a
mississippi
yager
and
two
colt
revolvers
get
ready
for
them
with
your
guns
and
when
they
come
within
fifty
yards
aim
low
blaze
away
and
bring
down
your
man
such
was
the
quick
command
of
simpson
the
words
had
hardly
escaped
from
his
mouth
when
the
three
yagers
almost
simultaneously
belched
forth
their
contents
we
then
seized
our
revolvers
and
opened
a
lively
fire
on
the
enemy
at
short
range
which
checked
their
advance
then
we
looked
over
our
little
barricade
to
ascertain
what
effect
our
fire
had
produced
and
were
much
gratified
at
seeing
three
dead
indians
and
one
horse
lying
on
the
ground
only
two
or
three
of
the
indians
it
seemed
had
it
must
be
remembered
that
in
those
days
every
indian
did
not
own
a
needle
gun
or
a
winchester
rifle
as
they
now
do
their
principal
weapons
were
their
bows
and
arrows
seeing
that
they
could
not
take
our
little
fortification
or
drive
us
from
it
they
circled
around
us
several
times
shooting
their
arrows
at
us
one
of
the
arrows
struck
george
wood
in
the
left
shoulder
inflicting
only
a
slight
wound
however
and
several
lodged
in
the
bodies
of
the
dead
mules
otherwise
they
did
us
no
harm
the
indians
finally
galloped
off
to
a
safe
distance
where
our
bullets
could
not
reach
them
and
seemed
to
be
holding
a
council
this
was
a
lucky
move
for
us
for
it
gave
us
an
opportunity
to
reload
our
guns
and
pistols
and
prepare
for
the
next
charge
of
the
enemy
during
the
brief
cessation
of
hostilities
simpson
extracted
the
arrow
from
shoulder
and
put
an
immense
quid
of
tobacco
on
the
wound
wood
was
then
ready
for
business
again
illustration
holding
the
fort
the
indians
did
not
give
us
a
very
long
rest
for
with
another
desperate
charge
as
if
to
ride
over
us
they
came
dashing
towards
the
mule
barricade
we
gave
them
a
hot
reception
from
our
yagers
and
revolvers
they
could
not
stand
or
understand
the
rapidly
repeating
fire
of
the
revolvers
and
we
again
checked
them
they
circled
around
us
once
more
and
gave
us
a
few
parting
shots
as
they
rode
off
leaving
behind
them
another
dead
indian
and
a
horse
for
two
hours
afterwards
they
did
not
seem
to
be
doing
anything
but
holding
a
council
we
made
good
use
of
this
time
by
digging
up
the
ground
inside
the
barricade
with
our
knives
and
throwing
the
loose
earth
around
and
over
the
mules
and
we
soon
had
a
very
respectable
fortification
we
were
not
troubled
any
more
that
day
but
during
the
night
the
cunning
rascals
tried
to
burn
us
out
by
setting
fire
to
the
prairie
the
buffalo
grass
was
so
short
that
the
fire
did
not
trouble
us
much
but
the
smoke
concealed
the
indians
from
our
view
and
they
thought
that
they
could
approach
close
to
us
without
being
seen
we
were
aware
of
this
and
kept
a
sharp
being
prepared
all
the
time
to
receive
them
they
finally
abandoned
the
idea
of
surprising
us
next
morning
bright
and
early
they
gave
us
one
more
grand
charge
and
again
we
stood
them
off
they
then
rode
away
half
a
mile
or
so
and
formed
a
circle
around
us
each
man
dismounted
and
sat
down
as
if
to
wait
and
starve
us
out
they
had
evidently
seen
the
advance
train
pass
on
the
morning
of
the
previous
day
and
believed
that
we
belonged
to
that
outfit
and
were
trying
to
overtake
it
they
had
no
idea
that
another
train
was
on
its
way
after
us
our
hopes
of
escape
from
this
unpleasant
and
perilous
situation
now
depended
upon
the
arrival
of
the
rear
train
and
when
we
saw
that
the
indians
were
going
to
besiege
us
instead
of
renewing
their
attacks
we
felt
rather
confident
of
receiving
timely
assistance
we
had
expected
that
the
train
would
be
along
late
in
the
afternoon
of
the
previous
day
and
as
the
morning
wore
away
we
were
somewhat
anxious
and
uneasy
at
its
at
last
about
ten
we
began
to
hear
in
the
distance
the
loud
and
sharp
reports
of
the
big
which
were
handled
with
great
dexterity
by
the
teamsters
and
cracked
like
rifle
shots
these
were
as
welcome
sounds
to
us
as
were
the
notes
of
the
to
the
beseiged
garrison
at
lucknow
when
the
reinforcements
were
coming
up
and
the
pipers
were
heard
playing
the
campbells
are
coming
in
a
few
moments
we
saw
the
lead
or
head
wagon
coming
slowly
over
the
ridge
which
had
concealed
the
train
from
our
view
and
soon
the
whole
outfit
made
its
appearance
the
indians
observed
the
approaching
train
and
assembling
in
a
group
they
held
a
short
consultation
they
then
charged
upon
us
once
more
for
the
last
time
and
as
they
turned
and
dashed
away
over
the
prairie
we
sent
our
farewell
shots
rattling
after
them
the
teamsters
seeing
the
indians
and
hearing
the
shots
came
rushing
forward
to
our
assistance
but
by
the
time
they
reached
us
the
had
almost
disappeared
from
view
the
teamsters
eagerly
asked
us
a
hundred
questions
concerning
our
fight
admired
our
fort
and
praised
our
pluck
remarkable
presence
of
mind
in
planning
the
defense
was
the
general
topic
of
conversation
among
all
the
men
when
the
teams
came
up
we
obtained
some
water
and
bandages
with
which
to
dress
wood
wound
which
had
become
quite
inflamed
and
painful
and
we
then
put
him
into
one
of
the
wagons
simpson
and
myself
obtained
a
remount
bade
to
our
dead
mules
which
had
served
us
so
well
and
after
collecting
the
ornaments
and
other
plunder
from
the
dead
indians
we
left
their
bodies
and
bones
to
bleach
on
the
prairie
the
train
moved
on
again
and
we
had
no
other
adventures
except
several
exciting
buffalo
hunts
on
the
south
platte
near
plum
creek
we
arrived
at
fort
leavenworth
about
the
middle
of
july
when
i
immediately
visited
home
i
found
mother
in
very
poor
health
as
she
was
suffering
from
asthma
my
oldest
sister
martha
had
during
my
absence
been
married
to
john
crane
and
was
living
at
leavenworth
during
the
winter
at
fort
bridger
i
had
frequently
talked
with
wild
bill
about
my
family
and
as
i
had
become
greatly
attached
to
him
i
asked
him
to
come
and
make
a
visit
at
our
house
which
he
promised
to
do
so
one
day
shortly
after
our
return
from
fort
bridger
he
accompanied
me
home
from
leavenworth
my
mother
and
sisters
who
had
heard
so
much
about
him
from
me
were
delighted
to
see
him
and
he
spent
several
weeks
at
our
place
they
did
everything
possible
to
repay
him
for
his
kindness
to
me
ever
afterwards
when
he
was
at
or
near
leavenworth
wild
bill
came
out
to
our
house
to
see
the
family
whether
i
was
at
home
or
not
and
he
always
received
a
most
cordial
reception
his
mother
and
sisters
lived
in
illinois
and
he
used
to
call
our
house
his
home
as
he
did
not
have
one
of
his
own
i
had
been
home
only
about
a
month
after
returning
from
fort
bridger
when
i
again
started
out
with
another
train
going
this
time
as
assistant
under
buck
bomer
we
went
safely
through
to
fort
laramie
which
was
our
destination
and
from
there
we
were
ordered
to
take
a
load
of
supplies
to
a
new
post
called
fort
wallach
which
was
being
established
at
cheyenne
pass
we
made
this
trip
and
got
back
to
fort
laramie
about
november
i
then
quit
the
employ
of
russell
majors
waddell
and
joined
a
party
of
trappers
who
were
sent
out
by
the
post
trader
ward
to
trap
on
the
streams
of
the
chugwater
and
laramie
for
beaver
otter
and
other
fur
animals
and
also
to
poison
wolves
for
their
pelts
we
were
out
two
months
but
as
the
expedition
did
not
prove
very
profitable
and
was
rather
dangerous
on
account
of
the
indians
we
abandoned
the
enterprise
and
came
into
fort
laramie
in
the
latter
part
of
december
being
anxious
to
return
to
the
missouri
river
i
joined
with
two
others
named
scott
and
charley
who
were
also
desirous
of
going
east
on
a
visit
bought
three
ponies
and
a
and
we
started
out
together
we
made
rapid
progress
on
our
journey
and
nothing
worthy
of
note
happened
until
one
afternoon
along
the
banks
of
the
little
blue
river
we
spied
a
band
of
indians
hunting
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
stream
three
miles
away
we
did
not
escape
their
notice
and
they
gave
us
a
lively
chase
for
two
hours
but
they
could
find
no
good
crossing
and
as
evening
came
on
we
finally
got
away
from
them
we
traveled
until
late
in
the
night
when
upon
discovering
a
low
deep
ravine
which
we
thought
would
make
a
comfortable
and
safe
we
stopped
for
a
rest
in
searching
for
a
good
place
to
make
our
beds
i
found
a
hole
and
i
called
to
my
companions
that
i
had
found
a
fine
place
for
a
nest
one
of
the
party
was
to
stand
guard
while
the
others
slept
scott
took
the
first
watch
while
charley
and
i
made
a
bed
in
the
hole
while
clearing
out
the
place
we
felt
something
rough
but
as
it
was
dark
we
could
not
make
out
what
it
was
at
any
rate
we
concluded
that
it
was
bones
or
sticks
of
wood
we
thought
perhaps
it
might
be
the
bones
of
some
animal
which
had
fallen
in
there
and
died
these
bones
for
such
they
really
proved
to
be
we
pushed
one
side
and
then
we
lay
down
but
charley
being
an
inveterate
smoker
could
not
resist
the
temptation
of
indulging
in
a
smoke
before
going
to
sleep
so
he
sat
up
and
struck
a
match
to
light
his
old
pipe
our
subterranean
was
thus
illuminated
for
a
moment
or
two
i
sprang
to
my
feet
in
an
instant
for
a
ghastly
and
horrifying
sight
was
revealed
to
us
eight
or
ten
human
skeletons
lay
scattered
upon
the
ground
the
light
of
the
match
died
out
but
we
had
seen
enough
to
convince
us
that
we
were
in
a
large
grave
into
which
perhaps
some
unfortunate
emigrants
who
had
been
killed
by
the
indians
had
been
thrown
or
perhaps
seeking
refuge
there
they
had
been
corraled
and
then
killed
on
the
spot
if
such
was
the
case
they
had
met
the
fate
of
thousands
of
others
whose
friends
have
never
heard
of
them
since
they
left
their
eastern
homes
to
seek
their
fortunes
in
the
far
west
however
we
did
not
care
to
investigate
this
mystery
any
further
but
we
hustled
out
of
that
chamber
of
death
and
informed
scott
of
our
discovery
most
of
the
are
very
superstitious
and
we
were
no
exception
to
the
general
rule
we
surely
thought
that
this
incident
was
an
evil
omen
and
that
we
would
be
killed
if
we
remained
there
any
longer
illustration
camping
in
a
sepulchre
let
us
dig
out
of
here
quicker
than
we
can
say
jack
robinson
said
scott
and
we
began
to
dig
out
at
once
we
saddled
our
animals
and
hurriedly
pushed
forward
through
the
darkness
traveling
several
miles
before
we
again
went
into
camp
next
morning
it
was
snowing
fiercely
but
we
proceeded
as
best
we
could
and
that
night
we
succeeded
in
reaching
oak
grove
ranch
which
had
been
built
during
the
summer
we
here
obtained
comfortable
accommodations
and
plenty
to
eat
and
drink
especially
the
latter
scott
and
charley
were
great
lovers
and
consumers
of
tanglefoot
and
they
soon
got
gloriously
drunk
keeping
it
up
for
three
days
during
which
time
they
gambled
with
the
ranchmen
who
got
away
with
all
their
money
but
little
they
cared
for
that
as
they
had
their
spree
they
finally
sobered
up
and
we
resumed
our
journey
urging
our
jaded
animals
as
much
as
they
could
stand
until
we
struck
marysville
on
the
big
blue
from
this
place
to
leavenworth
we
secured
accommodations
along
the
road
as
the
country
had
become
pretty
well
settled
it
was
in
february
that
i
got
home
as
there
was
now
a
good
school
in
the
neighborhood
taught
by
divinny
my
mother
wished
me
to
attend
it
and
i
did
so
for
two
months
and
a
half
the
longest
period
of
schooling
that
i
ever
received
at
any
one
time
in
my
life
as
soon
as
the
spring
came
and
the
grass
began
growing
i
became
uneasy
and
discontented
and
again
longed
for
the
free
and
open
life
of
the
plains
the
pike
peak
gold
excitement
was
then
at
its
height
and
everybody
was
rushing
to
the
new
gold
diggings
i
caught
the
myself
and
joined
a
party
bound
for
the
new
town
of
auraria
on
cherry
creek
afterwards
called
denver
in
honor
of
the
then
governor
of
kansas
on
arriving
at
auraria
we
pushed
on
to
the
gold
streams
in
the
mountains
passing
up
through
golden
gate
and
over
guy
hill
and
thence
on
to
black
hawk
we
prospected
for
two
months
but
as
none
of
us
knew
anything
about
mining
we
met
with
very
poor
success
and
we
finally
concluded
that
prospecting
for
gold
was
not
our
forte
we
accordingly
abandoned
the
enterprise
and
turned
our
faces
eastward
once
more
illustration
rafting
on
the
platte
when
we
struck
the
platte
river
the
happy
thought
of
constructing
a
small
raft
which
would
float
us
clear
to
the
missouri
and
thence
down
to
leavenworth
entered
our
heads
and
we
accordingly
carried
out
the
plan
upon
the
completion
of
the
raft
we
stocked
it
with
provisions
and
set
sail
down
the
stream
it
was
a
light
craft
and
a
jolly
crew
and
all
was
smooth
sailing
for
four
or
five
days
when
we
got
near
old
julesburg
we
met
with
a
serious
mishap
our
raft
ran
into
an
eddy
and
quick
as
lightning
went
to
pieces
throwing
us
all
into
the
stream
which
was
so
deep
that
we
had
to
swim
ashore
we
lost
everything
we
had
which
greatly
discouraged
us
and
we
thereupon
abandoned
the
idea
of
rafting
it
any
farther
we
then
walked
over
to
julesburg
which
was
only
a
few
miles
distant
this
ranch
which
became
a
somewhat
famous
spot
had
been
established
by
old
jules
a
frenchman
who
was
afterwards
killed
by
the
notorious
alf

the
great
pony

about
which
so
much
has
been
said
and
written
was
at
that
time
just
being
started
the
line
was
being
stocked
with
horses
and
put
into
good
running
condition
at
julesburg
i
met
george
chrisman
the
leading
of
russell
majors
waddell
who
had
always
been
a
good
friend
to
me
he
had
bought
out
old
jules
and
was
then
the
owner
of
julesburg
ranch
and
the
agent
of
the
pony
express
line
he
hired
me
at
once
as
a
pony
express
rider
but
as
i
was
so
young
he
thought
i
would
not
be
able
to
stand
the
fierce
riding
which
was
required
of
the
messengers
he
knew
however
that
i
had
been
raised
in
the
saddle
that
i
felt
more
at
home
there
than
in
any
other
place
and
as
he
saw
that
i
was
confident
that
i
could
stand
the
racket
and
could
ride
as
far
and
endure
it
as
well
as
some
of
the
older
riders
he
gave
me
a
short
route
of
miles
with
the
stations
fifteen
miles
apart
and
three
changes
of
horses
i
was
required
to
make
fifteen
miles
an
hour
including
the
changes
of
horses
i
was
fortunate
in
getting
animals
and
being
so
light
i
easily
made
my
miles
on
time
on
my
first
trip
out
and
ever
afterwards
i
wrote
to
mother
and
told
her
how
well
i
liked
the
exciting
life
of
a
pony
express
rider
she
replied
and
begged
of
me
to
give
it
up
as
it
would
surely
kill
me
she
was
right
about
this
as
fifteen
miles
an
hour
on
horseback
would
in
a
short
time
shake
any
man
all
to
pieces
and
there
were
but
very
few
if
any
riders
who
could
stand
it
for
any
great
length
of
time
nevertheless
i
stuck
to
it
for
two
months
and
then
upon
receiving
a
letter
informing
me
that
my
mother
was
very
sick
i
gave
it
up
and
went
back
to
the
old
home
in
salt
creek
valley
chapter

accidents
and
escapes
my
restless
roaming
spirit
would
not
allow
me
to
remain
at
home
very
long
and
in
november
after
the
recovery
of
my
mother
i
went
up
the
republican
river
and
its
tributaries
on
a
trapping
expedition
in
company
with
dave
harrington
our
outfit
consisted
of
one
wagon
and
a
yoke
of
oxen
for
the
transportation
of
provisions
traps
and
other
necessaries
we
began
trapping
near
junction
city
kansas
and
then
proceeded
up
the
republican
river
to
the
mouth
of
prairie
dog
creek
where
we
found
plenty
of
beavers
having
seen
no
signs
of
indians
thus
far
we
felt
comparatively
safe
we
were
catching
a
large
number
of
beavers
and
were
prospering
finely
when
one
of
our
oxen
having
become
rather
poor
slipped
and
fell
upon
the
ice
dislocating
his
hip
so
that
we
had
to
shoot
him
to
end
his
misery
this
left
us
without
a
team
but
we
cared
little
for
that
however
as
we
had
made
up
our
minds
to
remain
there
till
spring
when
and
it
was
decided
that
one
of
us
should
go
to
the
nearest
settlement
and
get
a
yoke
of
oxen
with
which
to
haul
our
wagon
into
some
place
of
safety
where
we
could
leave
it
we
would
probably
have
pulled
through
the
winter
all
right
had
it
not
been
for
a
very
serious
accident
which
befell
me
just
at
that
time
spying
a
herd
of
elk
we
started
in
pursuit
of
them
and
creeping
up
towards
them
as
slyly
as
possible
while
going
around
the
bend
of
a
sharp
bluff
or
bank
of
the
creek
i
slipped
and
broke
my
leg
just
above
the
ankle
notwithstanding
the
great
pain
i
was
suffering
harrington
could
not
help
laughing
when
i
urged
him
to
shoot
me
as
he
had
the
ox
and
thus
end
my
misery
he
told
me
to
brace
up
and
that
he
would
bring
me
out
all
right
i
am
not
much
of
a
surgeon
said
he
but
i
can
fix
that
leg
of
yours
even
if
i
have
got
a
diploma
he
succeeded
in
getting
me
back
to
camp
which
was
only
a
few
yards
from
the
creek
and
then
he
set
the
fracture
as
well
as
he
knew
how
and
made
me
as
comfortable
as
was
possible
under
the
circumstances
we
then
discussed
the
situation
which
to
say
the
least
looked
pretty
blue
knowing
that
owing
to
our
mishaps
we
could
not
do
anything
more
that
winter
and
as
i
dreaded
the
idea
of
lying
there
on
my
back
with
a
broken
leg
for
weeks
and
perhaps
months
i
prevailed
upon
harrington
to
go
the
nearest
settlement
about
miles
distant
to
obtain
a
yoke
of
cattle
and
then
come
back
for
me
this
he
consented
to
do
but
before
leaving
he
gathered
plenty
of
wood
and
as
the
ground
was
covered
with
snow
i
would
have
no
difficulty
in
getting
water
if
i
had
a
fire
there
was
plenty
of
fresh
meat
and
other
provisions
in
the
so
that
i
had
no
fears
of
starvation
the
dugout
which
we
had
built
immediately
after
we
had
determined
to
remain
there
all
winter
was
a
very
cosy
hole
in
the
ground
covered
with
poles
grass
and
sod
with
a
fireplace
in
one
end
harrington
thought
it
would
take
him
twenty
days
or
more
to
make
the
round
trip
but
being
well
provided
for
for
this
length
of
time
i
urged
him
to
go
at
once
bidding
me
he
started
on
foot
after
his
departure
each
day
as
it
came
and
went
seemed
to
grow
longer
to
me
as
i
lay
there
helpless
and
alone
i
made
a
note
of
each
day
so
as
to
know
the
time
when
i
might
expect
him
back
illustration
saved
by
chief
on
the
twelfth
day
after
harrington
left
me
i
was
awakened
from
a
sound
sleep
by
some
one
touching
me
upon
the
shoulder
i
looked
up
and
was
astonished
to
see
an
indian
warrior
standing
at
my
side
his
face
was
hideously
daubed
with
paint
which
told
me
more
forcibly
than
words
could
have
done
that
he
was
on
the
he
spoke
to
me
in
broken
english
and
sioux
mixed
and
i
understood
him
to
ask
what
i
was
doing
there
and
how
many
there
were
with
me
by
this
time
the
little
was
nearly
filled
with
other
indians
who
had
been
peeping
in
at
the
door
and
i
could
hear
voices
of
still
more
outside
as
well
as
the
stamping
of
horses
i
began
to
think
that
my
time
had
come
as
the
saying
is
when
into
the
cabin
stepped
an
elderly
indian
whom
i
readily
recognized
as
old
a
sioux
chief
from
the
vicinity
of
fort
laramie
i
rose
up
as
well
as
i
could
and
showed
him
my
broken
leg
i
told
him
where
i
had
seen
him
and
asked
him
if
he
remembered
me
he
replied
that
he
knew
me
well
and
that
i
used
to
come
to
his
lodge
at
fort
laramie
to
visit
him
i
then
managed
to
make
him
understand
that
i
was
there
alone
and
having
broken
my
leg
i
had
sent
my
partner
off
for
a
team
to
take
me
away
i
asked
him
if
his
young
men
intended
to
kill
me
and
he
answered
that
was
what
they
had
proposed
to
do
but
he
would
see
what
they
had
to
say
the
indians
then
talked
among
themselves
for
a
few
minutes
and
upon
the
conclusion
of
the
consultation
old
turned
to
me
and
gave
me
to
understand
that
as
i
was
yet
a
papoose
or
a
very
young
man
they
would
not
take
my
life
but
one
of
his
men
who
had
no
wanted
my
gun
and
pistol
i
implored
old
to
be
allowed
to
keep
the
weapons
or
at
least
one
of
them
as
i
needed
something
with
which
to
keep
the
wolves
away
he
replied
that
as
his
young
men
were
out
on
the
war
path
he
had
induced
them
to
spare
my
life
but
he
could
not
prevent
them
from
taking
what
ever
else
they
wanted
they
unsaddled
their
horses
as
if
to
remain
there
for
some
time
and
sure
enough
they
stayed
the
remainder
of
the
day
and
all
night
they
built
a
fire
in
the
and
cooked
a
lot
of
my
provisions
helping
themselves
to
everything
as
if
they
owned
it
however
they
were
polite
enough
to
give
me
some
of
the
food
after
they
had
cooked
it
it
was
a
sumptuous
feast
that
they
had
and
they
seemed
to
relish
it
as
if
it
was
the
best
they
had
had
for
many
a
long
day
they
took
all
my
sugar
and
coffee
and
left
me
only
some
meat
and
a
small
quantity
of
flour
a
little
salt
and
some
baking
powder
they
also
robbed
me
of
such
cooking
utensils
as
they
wished
then
bidding
me
early
in
the
morning
they
mounted
their
ponies
and
rode
off
to
the
south
evidently
bent
on
some
murdering
and
thieving
expedition
i
was
glad
enough
to
see
them
leave
as
my
life
had
undoubtedly
hung
by
a
thread
during
their
presence
i
am
confident
that
had
it
not
been
for
my
youth
and
the
timely
recognition
and
interference
of
old
they
would
have
killed
me
without
any
hesitation
or
ceremony
the
second
day
after
they
had
gone
it
began
snowing
and
for
three
long
and
weary
days
the
snow
continued
to
fall
thick
and
fast
it
blocked
the
and
covered
the
to
the
depth
of
several
feet
so
that
i
became
a
snowbound
prisoner
my
wood
was
mostly
under
the
snow
and
it
was
with
great
difficulty
that
i
could
get
enough
to
start
a
fire
with
my
prospects
were
gloomy
indeed
i
had
just
faced
death
at
the
hands
of
the
indians
and
now
i
was
in
danger
of
losing
my
life
from
starvation
and
cold
i
knew
that
the
heavy
snow
would
surely
delay
harrington
on
his
return
and
i
feared
that
he
might
have
perished
in
the
storm
or
that
some
other
accident
might
have
befallen
him
perhaps
some
wandering
band
of
indians
had
run
across
him
and
killed
him
i
was
continually
thinking
of
all
these
possibilities
and
i
must
say
that
my
outlook
seemed
desperate
at
last
the
twentieth
day
arrived
the
day
on
which
harrington
was
to
return
and
i
counted
the
hours
from
morning
till
night
but
the
day
passed
away
with
no
signs
of
harrington
the
wolves
made
the
night
hideous
with
their
howls
they
gathered
around
the
ran
over
the
roof
and
pawed
and
scratched
as
if
trying
to
get
in
several
days
and
nights
thus
wore
away
the
monotony
all
the
time
becoming
greater
until
at
last
it
became
almost
unendurable
some
days
i
would
go
without
any
fire
at
all
and
eat
raw
frozen
meat
and
melt
snow
in
my
mouth
for
water
i
became
almost
convinced
that
harrington
had
been
caught
in
the
storm
and
had
been
buried
under
the
snow
or
was
lost
many
a
time
during
that
dreary
period
of
uncertainty
i
made
up
my
mind
that
if
i
ever
got
out
of
that
place
alive
i
would
abandon
the
plains
and
the
life
of
a
trapper
forever
i
had
nearly
given
up
all
hopes
of
leaving
the
alive
it
was
on
the
day
while
i
was
lying
thus
despondently
thinking
and
wondering
that
i
heard
the
cheerful
sound
of
voice
as
he
came
slowly
up
the
creek
yelling
whoa
haw
to
his
cattle
a
criminal
on
the
scaffold
with
the
noose
around
his
neck
the
trap
about
to
be
sprung
and
receiving
a
pardon
just
at
the
last
moment
thus
giving
him
a
new
lease
of
life
could
not
have
been
more
grateful
than
i
was
at
that
time
it
was
useless
for
me
to
try
to
force
the
door
open
as
the
snow
had
completely
blockaded
it
and
i
therefore
anxiously
awaited
harrington
arrival
hello
billy
he
sang
out
in
a
loud
voice
as
he
came
up
he
evidently
being
uncertain
as
to
my
being
alive
all
right
dave
was
my
reply
well
old
boy
you
alive
are
you
said
he
yes
and
that
about
all
i
had
a
tough
siege
of
it
since
been
away
and
i
came
pretty
nearly
passing
in
my
chips
i
began
to
think
you
never
would
get
here
as
i
was
afraid
you
had
been
snowed
under
said
i
he
soon
cleared
away
the
snow
from
the
entrance
and
opening
the
door
he
came
in
i
do
think
there
ever
was
a
more
welcome
visitor
than
he
was
i
remember
that
i
was
so
glad
to
see
him
that
i
put
my
arms
around
his
neck
and
hugged
him
for
five
minutes
never
shall
i
forget
faithful
dave
harrington
well
billy
my
boy
i
hardly
expected
to
see
you
alive
again
said
harrington
as
soon
as
i
had
given
him
an
opportunity
to
draw
his
breath
i
had
a
terrible
trip
of
it
and
i
did
think
i
ever
would
get
through
i
was
caught
in
the
and
was
laid
up
for
three
days
the
cattle
wandered
away
and
i
came
within
an
ace
of
losing
them
altogether
when
i
got
started
again
the
snow
was
so
deep
that
it
prevented
me
from
making
much
headway
but
as
i
had
left
you
here
i
was
bound
to
come
through
or
die
in
the
attempt
again
i
flung
my
arms
around
dave
neck
and
gave
him
a
hug
that
would
have
done
honor
to
a
grizzly
bear
my
gratitude
was
thus
much
more
forcibly
expressed
than
it
could
have
been
by
words
harrington
understood
this
and
seemed
to
appreciate
it
the
tears
of
joy
rolled
down
my
cheeks
and
it
was
impossible
for
me
to
restrain
them
when
my
life
had
been
threatened
by
the
indians
i
had
not
felt
half
so
miserable
as
when
i
lay
in
the
thinking
i
was
destined
to
die
a
slow
death
by
starvation
and
cold
the
indians
would
have
made
short
work
of
it
and
would
have
given
me
little
or
no
time
to
think
of
my
fate
i
questioned
harrington
as
to
his
trip
and
learned
all
the
details
he
had
passed
through
hardships
which
but
few
men
could
have
endured
noble
fellow
that
he
was
he
had
risked
his
own
life
to
save
mine
after
he
had
finished
his
story
every
word
of
which
i
had
listened
to
with
eager
interest
i
related
to
him
my
own
experiences
in
which
he
became
no
less
interested
he
expressed
great
astonishment
that
the
indians
had
not
killed
me
and
he
considered
it
one
of
the
luckiest
and
most
remarkable
escapes
he
had
ever
heard
of
it
amused
me
however
to
see
him
get
very
angry
when
i
told
him
that
they
had
taken
my
gun
and
pistol
and
had
used
up
our
provisions
but
never
mind
billy
said
he
we
can
stand
it
till
the
snow
goes
off
which
will
not
be
long
and
then
we
will
pull
our
wagon
back
to
the
settlements
a
few
days
afterwards
harrington
gathered
up
our
traps
and
cleaned
the
snow
out
of
the
wagon
covering
it
with
the
sheet
which
we
had
used
in
the
he
made
a
comfortable
bed
inside
and
helped
me
into
it
we
had
been
quite
successful
in
trapping
having
caught
three
hundred
beavers
and
one
hundred
otters
the
skins
of
which
harrington
loaded
on
the
wagon
we
then
pulled
out
for
the
settlements
making
good
headway
as
the
snow
had
nearly
disappeared
having
been
blown
or
melted
away
so
that
we
had
no
difficulty
in
finding
a
road
on
the
eighth
day
out
we
came
to
a
farmer
house
or
ranch
on
the
republican
river
where
we
stopped
and
rested
for
two
days
and
then
went
on
to
the
ranch
where
harrington
had
obtained
the
yoke
of
cattle
we
gave
the
owner
of
the
team
beaver
skins
equal
to
for
the
use
of
the
cattle
and
he
let
us
have
them
until
we
reached
junction
city
sending
his
boy
with
us
to
bring
them
back
at
junction
city
we
sold
our
wagon
and
furs
and
went
with
a
government
mule
train
to
leavenworth
arriving
there
in
march
i
was
just
able
to
get
around
on
crutches
when
i
got
into
leavenworth
and
it
was
several
months
after
that
before
i
entirely
recovered
the
use
of
my
leg
during
the
winter
i
had
often
talked
to
harrington
about
my
mother
and
sisters
and
had
invited
him
to
go
home
with
me
in
the
spring
i
now
renewed
the
invitation
which
he
accepted
and
accompanied
me
home
when
i
related
to
mother
my
adventures
and
told
her
how
harrington
had
saved
my
life
she
thanked
him
again
and
again
i
never
saw
a
more
grateful
woman
than
she
was
she
asked
him
to
always
make
his
home
with
us
as
she
never
could
reward
him
sufficiently
for
what
he
had
done
for
her
darling
boy
as
she
called
me
harrington
concluded
to
remain
with
us
through
the
summer
and
farm
mother
land
but
alas
the
uncertainty
of
life
the
coming
of
death
when
least
expected
was
strikingly
illustrated
in
his
case
during
the
latter
part
of
april
he
went
to
a
nursery
for
some
trees
and
while
coming
home
late
at
night
he
caught
a
severe
cold
and
was
taken
seriously
sick
with
lung
fever
mother
did
everything
in
her
power
for
him
she
could
not
have
done
more
had
he
been
her
own
son
but
notwithstanding
her
motherly
care
and
attention
and
the
skill
of
a
physician
from
leavenworth
he
rapidly
grew
worse
it
seemed
hard
indeed
to
think
that
a
great
strong
man
like
harrington
who
had
braved
the
storms
and
endured
the
other
hardships
of
the
plains
all
winter
long
should
during
the
warm
and
beautiful
days
of
spring
when
surrounded
by
friends
and
the
comforts
of
a
good
home
be
fatally
stricken
down
but
such
was
his
fate
he
died
one
week
from
the
day
on
which
he
was
taken
sick
we
all
mourned
his
loss
as
we
would
that
of
a
loved
son
or
brother
as
he
was
one
of
the
truest
bravest
and
best
of
friends
amid
sorrow
and
tears
we
laid
him
away
to
rest
in
a
picturesque
spot
on
pilot
knob
his
death
cast
a
gloom
over
our
household
and
it
was
a
long
time
before
it
was
entirely
dispelled
i
felt
very
lonely
without
harrington
and
i
soon
wished
for
a
change
of
scene
again
chapter
viii
adventures
on
the
overland
road
as
the
warm
days
of
summer
approached
i
longed
for
the
cool
air
of
the
mountains
and
to
the
mountains
i
determined
to
go
after
engaging
a
man
to
take
care
of
the
farm
i
proceeded
to
leavenworth
and
there
met
my
old
and
friend
lewis
simpson
who
was
fitting
out
a
train
at
atchison
and
loading
it
with
supplies
for
the
overland
stage
company
of
which
russell
my
old
employer
was
one
of
the
proprietors
simpson
was
going
with
this
train
to
fort
laramie
and
points
further
west
come
along
with
me
billy
said
he
i
give
you
a
good
i
want
you
with
me
i
do
know
that
i
would
like
to
go
as
far
west
as
that
again
replied
i
but
i
do
want
to
ride
the
pony
express
once
more
some
life
in
that
yes
that
so
but
it
will
soon
shake
the
life
out
of
you
said
he
however
if
that
what
you
got
your
mind
set
on
you
had
better
come
to
atchison
with
me
and
see
russell
who
i
pretty
certain
will
give
you
a
situation
i
replied
that
i
would
do
that
i
then
went
home
and
informed
mother
of
my
intention
and
as
her
health
was
very
poor
i
had
great
difficulty
in
obtaining
her
consent
i
finally
convinced
her
that
as
i
was
of
no
use
on
the
farm
it
would
be
better
and
more
profitable
for
me
to
return
to
the
plains
so
after
giving
her
all
the
money
i
had
earned
by
trapping
i
bade
her
and
set
out
for
atchison
i
met
russell
there
and
asked
him
for
employment
as
a
pony
he
gave
me
a
letter
to
slade
who
was
then
the
stage
agent
for
the
division
extending
from
julesburg
to
rocky
ridge
slade
had
his
headquarters
at
horseshoe
station
miles
west
of
fort
laramie
and
i
made
the
trip
thither
in
company
with
simpson
and
his
train
almost
the
very
first
person
i
saw
after
dismounting
from
my
horse
was
slade
i
walked
up
to
him
and
presented
russell
letter
which
he
hastily
opened
and
read
with
a
sweeping
glance
of
his
eye
he
took
my
measure
from
head
to
foot
and
then
said
my
boy
you
are
too
young
for
a
pony
it
takes
men
for
that
business
i
rode
two
months
last
year
on
bill
trotter
division
sir
and
filled
the
bill
then
and
i
think
i
am
better
able
to
ride
now
said
i
what
are
you
the
boy
that
was
riding
there
and
was
called
the
youngest
rider
on
the
road
i
am
the
same
boy
i
replied
confident
that
everything
was
now
all
right
for
me
i
have
heard
of
you
before
you
are
a
year
or
so
older
now
and
i
think
you
can
stand
it
i
give
you
a
trial
anyhow
and
if
you
weaken
you
can
come
back
to
horseshoe
station
and
tend
stock
that
ended
our
first
interview
the
next
day
he
assigned
me
to
duty
on
the
road
from
red
buttes
on
the
north
platte
to
the
three
crossings
of
the
sweetwater
a
distance
of
miles
and
i
began
riding
at
once
it
was
a
long
piece
of
road
but
i
was
equal
to
the
undertaking
and
soon
afterwards
had
an
opportunity
to
exhibit
my
power
of
endurance
as
a
pony
express
rider
one
day
when
i
galloped
into
three
crossings
my
home
station
i
found
that
the
rider
who
was
expected
to
take
the
trip
out
on
my
arrival
had
got
into
a
drunken
row
the
night
before
and
had
been
killed
and
that
there
was
no
one
to
fill
his
place
i
did
not
hesitate
for
a
moment
to

an
extra
ride
of
miles

rocky
ridge

arrived
at
the
latter
place
on

then
turned
back

immediately

horses
slade
heard
of
this
feat
of
mine
and
one
day
as
he
was
passing
on
a
coach
he
sang
out
to
me
my
boy
you
a
brick
and
no
mistake
that
was
a
good
run
you
made
when
you
rode
your
own
and
miller
routes
and
i
see
that
you
get
extra
pay
for
it
slade
although
rough
at
times
and
always
a
dangerous
character
having
killed
many
a
man
was
always
kind
to
me
during
the
two
years
that
i
worked
for
him
as
pony
and
he
never
spoke
an
angry
word
to
me
as
i
was
leaving
horse
creek
one
day
a
party
of
fifteen
indians
jumped
me
in
a
sand
ravine
about
a
mile
west
of
the
station
they
fired
at
me
repeatedly
but
missed
their
mark
i
was
mounted
on
a
roan
california
horse
the
fleetest
steed
i
had
putting
spurs
and
whip
to
him
and
lying
flat
on
his
back
i
kept
straight
on
for
sweetwater
bridge
eleven
miles
distant
instead
of
trying
to
turn
back
to
horse
creek
the
indians
came
on
in
hot
pursuit
but
my
horse
soon
got
away
from
them
and
ran
into
the
station
two
miles
ahead
of
them
the
had
been
killed
there
that
morning
and
all
the
stock
had
been
driven
off
by
the
indians
and
as
i
was
therefore
unable
to
change
horses
i
continued
on
to
station
twelve
miles
further
thus
making
miles
straight
run
with
one
horse
i
told
the
people
at
ploutz
what
had
happened
at
sweetwater
bridge
and
with
a
fresh
horse
went
on
and
finished
the
trip
without
any
further
adventure

attack
on

about
the
middle
of
september
the
indians
became
very
troublesome
on
the
line
of
the
stage
road
along
the
sweetwater
between
split
rock
and
three
crossings
they
robbed
a
stage
killed
the
driver
and
two
passengers
and

the
assistant

the
thieves
also
drove
off
the
stock
from
the
different
stations
and
were
continually
lying
in
wait
for
the
passing
stages
and
pony
so
that
we
had
to
take
many
desperate
chances
in
running
the
gauntlet
the
indians
had
now
become
so
bad
and
had
stolen
so
much
stock
that
it
was
decided
to
stop
the
pony
express
for
at
least
six
weeks
and
to
run
the
stages
but
occasionally
during
that
period
in
fact
it
would
have
been
almost
impossible
to
have
run
the
enterprise
much
longer
without
restocking
the
line
while
we
were
thus
nearly
all
lying
idle
a
party
was
organized
to
go
out
and
search
for
stolen
stock
this
party
was
composed
of
and
ranchmen
forty
of
them
altogether
and
they
were
and
they
were
mostly
men
who
had
undergone
all
kinds
of
hardships
and
braved
every
danger
and
they
were
ready
and
anxious
to
tackle
any
number
of
indians
wild
bill
who
had
been
driving
stage
on
the
road
and
had
recently
come
down
to
our
division
was
elected
captain
of
the
company
it
was
supposed
that
the
stolen
stock
had
been
taken
to
the
head
of
powder
river
and
vicinity
and
the
party
of
which
i
was
a
member
started
out
for
that
section
in
high
hopes
of
success
twenty
miles
out
from
sweetwater
bridge
at
the
head
of
horse
creek
we
found
an
indian
trail
running
north
towards
powder
river
and
we
could
see
by
the
tracks
that
most
of
the
horses
had
been
recently
shod
and
were
undoubtedly
our
stolen
stage
stock
pushing
rapidly
forward
we
followed
this
trail
to
powder
river
thence
down
this
stream
to
within
about
forty
miles
of
the
spot
where
old
fort
reno
now
stands
here
the
trail
took
a
more
westerly
course
along
the
foot
of
the
mountains
leading
eventually
to
crazy
woman
fork
a
tributary
of
powder
river
at
this
point
we
discovered
that
the
party
whom
we
were
trailing
had
been
joined
by
another
band
of
indians
and
judging
from
the
fresh
appearance
of
the
trail
the
united
body
could
not
have
left
this
spot
more
than
hours
before
being
aware
that
we
were
now
in
the
heart
of
the
hostile
country
and
that
we
might
at
any
moment
find
more
indians
than
we
had
lost
we
advanced
with
more
caution
than
usual
and
kept
a
sharp
lookout
as
we
were
approaching
clear
creek
another
tributary
of
powder
river
we
discovered
indians
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
creek
some
three
miles
distant
at
least
we
saw
horses
grazing
which
was
a
sure
sign
that
there
were
indians
there
the
indians
thinking
themselves
in
comparative
safety
never
before
having
been
followed
so
far
into
their
own
country
by
white
men
had
neglected
to
put
out
any
scouts
they
had
no
idea
that
there
were
any
white
men
in
that
part
of
the
country
we
got
the
lay
of
their
camp
and
then
held
a
council
to
consider
and
mature
a
plan
for
capturing
it
we
knew
full
well
that
the
indians
would
outnumber
us
at
least
three
to
one
and
perhaps
more
upon
the
advice
and
suggestion
of
wild
bill
it
was
finally
decided
that
we
should
wait
until
it
was
nearly
dark
and
then
after
creeping
as
close
to
them
as
possible
make
a
dash
through
their
camp
open
a
general
fire
on
them
and
stampede
the
horses
this
plan
at
the
proper
time
was
most
successfully
executed
the
dash
upon
the
enemy
was
a
complete
surprise
to
them
they
were
so
overcome
with
astonishment
that
they
did
not
know
what
to
make
of
it
we
could
not
have
astonished
them
any
more
if
we
had
dropped
down
into
their
camp
from
the
clouds
they
did
not
recover
from
the
surprise
of
this
sudden
charge
until
after
we
had
ridden
through
their
camp
and
got
away
with
our
own
horses
as
well
as
theirs
we
at
once
circled
the
horses
around
towards
the
south
and
after
getting
them
on
the
south
side
of
clear
creek
some
twenty
of
our
men
just
as
the
darkness
was
coming
on
rode
back
and
gave
the
indians
a
few
parting
shots
we
then
took
up
our
line
of
march
for
sweetwater
bridge
where
we
arrived
four
days
afterwards
with
all
of
our
own
horses
and
about
one
hundred
captured
indian
ponies
the
expedition
had
proved
a
grand
success
and
the
event
was
celebrated
in
the
usual
manner
by
a
grand
spree
the
only
store
at
sweetwater
bridge
did
a
rushing
business
for
several
days
the
returned
drank
and
gambled
and
fought
the
indian
ponies
which
had
been
distributed
among
the
captors
passed
from
hand
to
hand
at
almost
every
deal
of
the
cards
there
seemed
to
be
no
limit
to
the
rioting
and
carousing
revelry
reigned
supreme
on
the
third
day
of
the
orgie
slade
who
had
heard
the
news
came
up
to
the
bridge
and
took
a
hand
in
the
fun
as
it
was
called
to
add
some
variation
and
excitement
to
the
occasion
slade
got
in
to
a
quarrel
with
a
and
shot
him
killing
him
almost
instantly

alf
slade
killing
the
driver
the
boys
became
so
elated
as
well
as
elevated
over
their
success
against
the
indians
that
most
of
them
were
in
favor
of
going
back
and
cleaning
out
the
whole
indian
race
one
old
driver
especially
dan
smith
was
eager
to
open
a
war
on
all
the
hostile
nations
and
had
the
drinking
been
continued
another
week
he
certainly
would
have
undertaken
the
job
and
alone
the
spree
finally
came
to
an
end
the
men
sobered
down
and
abandoned
the
idea
of
again
invading
the
hostile
country
the
recovered
horses
were
replaced
on
the
road
and
the
stages
and
pony
express
were
again
running
on
time
slade
having
taken
a
great
fancy
to
me
said
billy
i
want
you
to
come
down
to
my
headquarters
and
i
make
you
a
sort
of
supernumerary
rider
and
send
you
out
only
when
it
is
necessary
i
accepted
the
offer
and
went
with
him
down
to
horseshoe
where
i
had
a
comparatively
easy
time
of
it
i
had
always
been
fond
of
hunting
and
i
now
had
a
good
opportunity
to
gratify
my
ambition
in
that
direction
as
i
had
plenty
of
spare
time
on
my
hands
in
this
connection
i
will
relate
one
of
my
adventures
one
day
when
i
had
nothing
else
to
do
i
saddled
up
an
extra
pony
express
horse
and
arming
myself
with
a
good
rifle
and
pair
of
revolvers
struck
out
for
the
foot
hills
of
laramie
peak
for
a
riding
carelessly
along
and
breathing
the
cool
and
bracing
autumn
air
which
came
down
from
the
mountains
i
felt
as
only
a
man
can
feel
who
is
roaming
over
the
prairies
of
the
far
west
well
armed
and
mounted
on
a
fleet
and
gallant
steed
the
perfect
freedom
which
he
enjoys
is
in
itself
a
refreshing
stimulant
to
the
mind
as
well
as
to
the
body
such
indeed
were
my
feelings
on
this
beautiful
day
as
i
rode
up
the
valley
of
the
horseshoe
occasionally
i
scared
up
a
flock
of
or
a
antelopes
and
deer
were
almost
always
in
sight
in
any
direction
but
as
they
were
not
the
kind
of
game
i
was
after
on
that
day
i
passed
them
by
and
kept
on
towards
the
higher
mountains
the
further
i
rode
the
rougher
and
wilder
became
the
country
and
i
knew
that
i
was
approaching
the
haunts
of
the
bear
i
did
not
discover
any
however
although
i
saw
plenty
of
tracks
in
the
snow
about
two
in
the
afternoon
my
horse
having
become
tired
and
myself
being
rather
weary
i
shot
a
and
dismounting
i
unsaddled
my
horse
and
tied
him
to
a
small
tree
where
he
could
easily
feed
on
the
mountain
grass
i
then
built
a
little
fire
and
broiling
the
chicken
and
seasoning
it
with
salt
and
pepper
which
i
had
obtained
from
my
i
soon
sat
down
to
a
genuine
square
meal
which
i
greatly
relished
after
resting
for
a
couple
of
hours
i
remounted
and
resumed
my
upward
trip
to
the
mountains
having
made
up
my
mind
to
camp
out
that
night
rather
than
go
back
without
a
bear
which
my
friends
knew
i
had
gone
out
for
as
the
days
were
growing
short
night
soon
came
on
and
i
looked
around
for
a
suitable
camping
place
while
thus
engaged
i
scared
up
a
flock
of
two
of
which
i
shot
intending
to
have
one
for
supper
and
the
other
for
breakfast
by
this
time
it
was
becoming
quite
dark
and
i
rode
down
to
one
of
the
little
mountain
streams
where
i
found
an
open
place
in
the
timber
suitable
for
a
camp
i
dismounted
and
after
unsaddling
my
horse
and
hitching
him
to
a
tree
i
prepared
to
start
a
fire
just
then
i
was
startled
by
hearing
a
horse
whinnying
further
up
the
stream
it
was
quite
a
surprise
to
me
and
i
immediately
ran
to
my
animal
to
keep
him
from
answering
as
horses
usually
do
in
such
cases
i
thought
that
the
strange
horse
might
belong
to
some
roaming
band
of
indians
as
i
knew
of
no
white
men
being
in
that
portion
of
the
country
at
that
time
i
was
certain
that
the
owner
of
the
strange
horse
could
not
be
far
distant
and
i
was
very
anxious
to
find
out
who
my
neighbor
was
before
letting
him
know
that
i
was
in
his
vicinity
i
therefore
my
horse
and
leaving
him
tied
so
that
i
could
easily
reach
him
i
took
my
gun
and
started
out
on
a
scouting
expedition
up
the
stream
i
had
gone
about
four
hundred
yards
when
in
a
bend
of
the
stream
i
discovered
ten
or
fifteen
horses
grazing
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
creek
a
light
was
shining
high
up
the
mountain
bank
approaching
the
mysterious
spot
as
cautiously
as
possible
and
when
within
a
few
yards
of
the
light
which
i
discovered
came
from
a
in
the
mountain
side
i
heard
voices
and
soon
i
was
able
distinguish
the
words
as
they
proved
to
be
in
my
own
language
then
i
knew
that
the
occupants
of
the
whence
the
voices
proceeded
were
white
men
thinking
that
they
might
be
a
party
of
trappers
i
boldly
walked
up
to
the
door
and
knocked
for
admission
the
voices
instantly
ceased
and
for
a
moment
a
deathlike
silence
reigned
inside
then
there
seemed
to
follow
a
kind
of
hurried
whispering
a
sort
of
consultation
and
then
some
one
called
out
who
there
a
friend
and
a
white
man
i
replied
the
door
opened
and
a
big
fellow
stepped
forth
and
said
come
in
i
accepted
the
invitation
with
some
degree
of
fear
and
hesitation
which
i
endeavored
to
conceal
as
i
saw
that
it
was
too
late
to
back
out
and
that
it
would
never
do
to
weaken
at
that
point
whether
they
were
friends
or
foes
upon
entering
the
my
eyes
fell
upon
eight
as
rough
and
villainous
looking
men
as
i
ever
saw
in
my
life
two
of
them
i
instantly
recognized
as
teamsters
who
had
been
driving
in
lew
simpson
train
a
few
months
before
and
had
been
discharged
they
were
charged
with
the
murdering
and
robbing
of
a
ranchman
and
having
stolen
his
horses
it
was
supposed
that
they
had
left
the
country
i
gave
them
no
signs
of
recognition
however
deeming
it
advisable
to
let
them
remain
in
ignorance
as
to
who
i
was
it
was
a
hard
crowd
and
i
concluded
that
the
sooner
i
could
get
away
from
them
the
better
it
would
be
for
me
i
felt
confident
that
they
were
a
band
of
where
are
you
going
young
man
and
who
with
you
asked
one
of
the
men
who
appeared
to
be
the
leader
of
the
gang
i
am
entirely
alone
i
left
horseshoe
station
this
morning
for
a
bear
hunt
and
not
finding
any
bears
i
had
determined
to
camp
out
for
the
night
and
wait
till
morning
said
i
and
just
as
i
was
going
into
camp
a
few
hundred
yards
down
the
creek
i
heard
one
of
your
horses
whinnying
and
then
i
came
up
to
your
camp
illustration
the
horse
thieves
den
i
was
thus
explicit
in
my
statement
in
order
if
possible
to
satisfy
the
that
i
was
not
spying
upon
them
but
that
my
intrusion
was
entirely
accidental
where
your
horse
demanded
the
boss
thief
i
left
him
down
the
creek
i
answered
they
proposed
going
after
the
horse
but
i
thought
that
that
would
never
do
as
it
would
leave
me
without
any
means
of
escape
and
i
accordingly
said
in
hopes
to
throw
them
off
the
track
captain
i
leave
my
gun
here
and
go
down
and
get
my
horse
and
come
back
and
stay
all
night
i
said
this
in
as
cheerful
and
as
careless
a
manner
as
possible
so
as
not
to
arouse
their
suspicions
in
any
way
or
lead
them
to
think
that
i
was
aware
of
their
true
character
i
hated
to
part
with
my
gun
but
my
suggestion
of
leaving
it
was
a
part
of
the
plan
of
escape
which
i
had
arranged
if
they
have
the
gun
thought
i
they
would
surely
believe
that
i
intended
to
come
back
but
this
little
game
did
not
work
at
all
as
one
of
the
desperadoes
spoke
up
and
said
jim
and
i
will
go
down
with
you
after
your
horse
and
you
can
leave
your
gun
here
all
the
same
as
you
not
need
it
all
right
i
replied
for
i
could
certainly
have
said
nothing
else
it
became
evident
to
me
that
it
would
be
better
to
trust
myself
with
two
men
than
with
the
whole
party
it
was
apparent
that
from
this
time
on
i
would
have
to
be
on
the
alert
for
some
good
opportunity
to
give
them
the
slip
come
along
said
one
of
them
and
together
we
went
down
the
creek
and
soon
came
to
the
spot
where
my
horse
was
tied
one
of
the
men
unhitched
the
animal
and
said
i
lead
the
horse
very
well
said
i
i
got
a
couple
of
here
lead
on
i
picked
up
the
which
i
had
killed
a
few
hours
before
and
followed
the
man
who
was
leading
the
horse
while
his
companion
brought
up
the
rear
the
nearer
we
approached
the
the
more
i
dreaded
the
idea
of
going
back
among
the
villainous
my
first
plan
of
escape
having
failed
i
now
determined
upon
another
illustration
my
escape
from
the
horse
thieves
i
had
both
of
my
revolvers
with
me
the
thieves
not
having
thought
it
necessary
to
search
me
it
was
now
quite
dark
and
i
purposely
dropped
one
of
the
and
asked
the
man
behind
me
to
pick
it
up
while
he
was
hunting
for
it
on
the
ground
i
quickly
pulled
out
one
of
my
revolvers
and
struck
him
a
tremendous
blow
on
the
back
of
the
head
knocking
him
senseless
to
the
ground
i
then
instantly
wheeled
around
and
saw
that
the
man
ahead
who
was
only
a
few
feet
distant
had
heard
the
blow
and
had
turned
to
see
what
was
the
matter
his
hand
upon
his
revolver
we
faced
each
other
at
about
the
same
instant
but
before
he
could
fire
as
he
tried
to
do
i
shot
him
dead
in
his
tracks
then
jumping
on
my
horse
i
rode
down
the
creek
as
fast
as
possible
through
the
darkness
and
over
the
rough
ground
and
rocks
the
other
outlaws
in
the
having
heard
the
shot
which
i
had
fired
knew
there
was
trouble
and
they
all
came
rushing
down
the
creek
i
suppose
by
the
time
they
reached
the
man
whom
i
had
knocked
down
that
he
had
recovered
and
hurriedly
told
them
of
what
had
happened
they
did
not
stay
with
the
man
whom
i
had
shot
but
came
on
in
hot
pursuit
of
me
they
were
not
mounted
and
were
making
better
time
down
the
rough
canõn
than
i
was
on
horseback
from
time
to
time
i
heard
them
gradually
gaining
on
me
at
last
they
had
come
so
near
that
i
saw
that
i
must
abandon
my
horse
so
i
jumped
to
the
ground
and
gave
him
a
hard
slap
with
the
butt
of
one
of
my
revolvers
which
started
him
on
down
the
valley
while
i
scrambled
up
the
mountain
side
i
had
not
ascended
more
than
forty
feet
when
i
heard
my
pursuers
coming
closer
and
closer
i
quickly
hid
behind
a
large
pine
tree
and
in
a
few
moments
they
all
rushed
by
me
being
led
on
by
the
rattling
footsteps
of
my
horse
which
they
heard
ahead
of
them
soon
i
heard
them
firing
at
random
at
the
horse
as
they
no
doubt
supposed
i
was
still
seated
on
his
back
as
soon
as
they
had
passed
me
i
climbed
further
up
the
steep
mountain
and
knowing
that
i
had
given
them
the
slip
and
feeling
certain
that
i
could
keep
out
of
their
way
i
at
once
struck
out
for
horseshoe
station
which
was
miles
distant
i
had
hard
traveling
at
first
but
upon
reaching
lower
and
better
ground
i
made
good
headway
walking
all
night
and
getting
into
the
station
just
before
daylight
weary
and
generally
played
out
i
immediately
waked
up
the
men
of
the
station
and
told
them
of
my
adventure
slade
himself
happened
to
be
there
and
he
at
once
organized
a
party
to
go
out
and
hunt
up
the
shortly
after
daylight
twenty
and
ranchmen
were
galloping
in
the
direction
of
the
of
course
i
went
along
with
the
party
notwithstanding
i
was
very
tired
and
had
had
hardly
any
rest
at
all
we
had
a
brisk
ride
and
arrived
in
the
immediate
vicinity
of
the
thieves
rendezvous
at
about
ten
in
the
morning
we
approached
the
cautiously
but
upon
getting
in
close
proximity
to
it
we
could
discover
no
horses
in
sight
we
could
see
the
door
of
the
standing
wide
open
and
we
then
marched
up
to
the
place
no
one
was
inside
and
the
general
appearance
of
everything
indicated
that
the
place
had
been
deserted
that
the
birds
had
flown
such
indeed
proved
to
be
the
case
we
found
a
grave
where
they
had
evidently
buried
the
man
whom
i
had
shot
we
made
a
thorough
search
of
the
whole
vicinity
and
finally
found
their
trail
going
southeast
in
the
direction
of
denver
as
it
would
have
been
useless
to
follow
them
we
rode
back
to
the
station
and
thus
ended
my
eventful
we
had
no
more
trouble
for
some
time
from
after
that
during
the
winter
of
and
the
spring
of
i
remained
at
horseshoe
occasionally
riding
pony
express
and
taking
care
of
stock
chapter
ix

driving
it
was
in
the
spring
of
while
i
was
at
horseshoe
that
the
coach
came
in
one
day
loaded
down
with
passengers
and
baggage
and
stopped
for
dinner
horseshoe
being
a
regular
dinner
station
as
well
as
a
home
station
the
passengers
consisted
of
six
englishmen
and
they
had
been
continually
grumbling
about
the
slow
time
that
was
being
made
by
the
stages
saying
that
the
farther
they
got
east
the
slower
they
went

said
another
their
remarks
were
overheard
by
bob
scott
who
was
to
drive
the
coach
from
horseshoe
to
fort
laramie
and
he
determined
to
give
them
satisfaction
before
they
got
over
his
route
scott
was
known
to
be
the
best
reinsman
and
the
most
expert
driver
on
the
whole
line
of
the
road
he
was
a
very
gentlemanly
fellow
in
his
general
appearance
and
conduct
but
at
times
he
would
become
a
reckless
and
would
take
more
desperate
chances
than
any
other
driver
he
delighted
in
driving
wild
teams
on
the
darkest
nights
over
a
mountain
road
and
had
thus
become
the
hero
of
many
a
thrilling
adventure
it
happened
on
this
day
he
was
to
drive
a
team
of
six
pony
express
horses
which
had
been
only
partially
broken
in
as
a
stage
team
as
the
were
hitching
them
up
bob
who
was
standing
by
said
i
show
them
englishmen
that
we
heathens
do
know
something
about
staging
in
this
country
we
all
knew
from
bob
looks
that
something
was
up
it
required
several
men
to
hitch
up
this
frisky
team
as
a
man
had
to
hold
on
to
each
one
of
the
horses
by
the
bits
while
they
were
stringing
them
out
the
englishmen
came
out
from
dinner
and
were
delighted
to
see
the
horses
prancing
and
pawing
as
if
anxious
to
start

bob
mounted

gathered
the
lines
and
pulling
the
horses
strongly
by
the
bits
he
sang
out
to
the

on

box
was

a
little
fellow
who
was
the
messenger
of
the
coach
after
everybody
was
seated
bob
told
the
to
turn
loose
we
who
were
standing
around
to
see
the
stage
start
out
expected
it
would
go
off
at
a
lively
rate
we
were
considerably
surprised
therefore
when
after
the
horses
had
made
a
few
lively
jumps
bob
put
on
the
big
california
brakes
and
brought
them
down
to
a
walk
the
road
for
a
distance
of
four
miles
gradually
rose
to
the
top
of
a
hill
and
all
the
way
up
this
ascent
bob
held
the
impatient
team
in
check
blarst
your
heyes
driver
why
do
you
let
them
go
exclaimed
one
of
the
passengers
who
had
all
along
been
expecting
a
very
brisk
ride
every
once
in
a
while
they
would
ask
him
some
such
question
but
he
paid
no
attention
to
them
at
last
he
reached
the
top
of
the
hill
and
then
he
suddenly
flung
three
of
the
lines
on
the
left
side
of
the
team
and
the
other
three
on
the
right
side
he
then
began
playing
the
silk
to
them
that
is
to
say
he
began
to
lash
them
unmercifully
the
team
started
off
like
a
streak
of
lightning
so
to
speak
without
a
single
rein
being
held
by
the
driver
bob
cried
out
to
the
englishmen
saying
hold
on
gentlemen
and
i
give
you
a
lively
ride
and
show
you
how
to
stage
it
in
the
rocky
mountains
illustration
bob
scott
famous
coach
ride
his
next
movement
was
to
pull
the
lamps
out
of
the
sockets
and
throw
them
at
the
leaders
the
glass
broke
upon
their
backs
and
nearly
set
them
wild
but
being
so
accustomed
to
running
the
road
they
never
once
left
the
track
and
went
flying
on
down
the
grade
towards
the
next
station
eight
miles
distant
the
coach
bouncing
over
the
loose
stones
and
small
obstacles
and
surging
from
side
to
side
as
an
eggshell
would
in
the
rapids
of
niagara
not
satisfied
with
the
rate
at
which
they
were
traveling
bob
pulled
out
his
revolver
and
fired
in
rapid
succession
at
the
same
time
yelling
in
a
demoniacal
manner
by
this
time
the
englishmen
had
become
thoroughly
frightened
as
they
saw
the
lines
flying
wildly
in
every
direction
and
the
team
running
away
they
did
not
know
whether
to
jump
out
or
remain
in
the
coach
bob
would
occasionally
look
down
from
his
seat
and
seeing
their
frightened
faces
would
ask
well
how
do
you
like
staging
in
this
country
now
the
englishmen
stuck
to
the
coach
probably
thinking
it
would
be
better
to
do
so
than
to
take
the
chances
of
breaking
their
necks
by
jumping
as
the
flying
team
was
nearing
the
station
the
stock
tender
saw
that
they
were
running
away
and
that
the
driver
had
no
control
over
them
whatever
being
aware
that
the
pony
express
horses
were
accustomed
to
running
right
into
the
stable
on
arriving
at
the
station
he
threw
open
the
large
folding
doors
which
would
just
allow
the
passage
of
the
team
and
coach
into
the
stable
the
horses
sure
enough
made
for
the
open
doorway
capt
cricket
the
messenger
and
scott
got
down
in
the
boot
of
the
coach
to
save
themselves
from
colliding
with
the
top
of
the
stable
door
the
coach
would
probably
have
passed
through
into
the
stable
without
any
serious
damage
had
it
not
been
for
the
bar
or
threshold
that
was
stretched
across
the
ground
to
fasten
the
doors
to
this
bar
was
a
small
log
and
the
front
wheels
struck
it
with
such
force
that
the
coach
was
thrown
up
high
enough
to
strike
the
upper
portion
of
the
door
frame
the
top
of
the
coach
was
completely
torn
off
and
one
of
the
arms
was
broken
this
was
the
only
serious
injury
that
was
done
though
it
was
a
matter
of
surprise
to
all
that
any
of
the
travelers
escaped
the
coach
was
backed
out
when
the
running
gear
was
found
to
be
as
good
as
ever
the
top
was
soon
patched
up
a
change
of
team
was
made
and
bob
scott
mounting
the
box
as
if
nothing
had
happened
took
the
reins
in
hand
and
shouted
all
aboard
the
englishmen
however
had
had
enough
of
bob
scott
and
not
one
of
the
party
was
willing
to
risk
his
life
with
him
again
they
said
that
he
was
drunk
or
crazy
or
both
and
that
they
would
report
him
and
have
him
discharged
for
what
he
had
already
done
bob
waited
a
few
minutes
to
give
them
an
opportunity
to
take
their
seats
in
the
coach
but
they
told
him
most
emphatically
that
he
could
drive
on
without
them
as
they
intended
to
wait
there
for
the
next
stage
their
traps
were
taken
off
and
bob
drove
away
without
a
single
passenger
he
made
his
usual
time
into
fort
laramie
which
was
the
end
of
his
run
the
englishmen
came
through
on
the
next
day
coach
and
proceeded
on
to
atchison
where
they
reported
bob
to
the
superintendent
of
the
line
who
however
paid
little
or
no
attention
to
the
matter
as
bob
remained
on
the
road
such
is
the
story
of
the
liveliest
and
most
reckless
piece
of
that
ever
occurred
on
the
overland
stage
road
chapter
x
questionable
proceedings
having
been
away
from
home
nearly
a
year
and
having
occasionally
heard
of
my
mother
poor
health
i
determined
to
make
her
a
visit
so
procuring
a
pass
over
the
road
i
went
to
leavenworth
arriving
there
about
june
going
from
there
home
the
civil
war
had
broken
out
and
excitement
ran
high
in
that
part
of
the
country
my
mother
of
course
was
a
strong
union
woman
and
had
such
great
confidence
in
the
government
that
she
believed
the
war
would
not
last
over
six
months
leavenworth
at
that
time
was
quite
an
important
outfitting
post
for
the
west
and
southwest
and
the
fort
there
was
garrisoned
by
a
large
number
of
troops
while
in
the
city
one
day
i
met
several
of
the
old
as
well
as
the
young
men
who
had
been
members
of
the
free
state
party
all
through
the
kansas
troubles
and
who
had
like
our
family
lost
everything
at
the
hands
of
the
missourians
they
now
thought
a
good
opportunity
offered
to
retaliate
and
get
even
with
their
persecutors
as
they
were
all
considered
to
be
secessionists
that
they
were
all
secessionists
however
was
not
true
as
all
of
them
did
not
sympathize
with
the
south
but
the
free
state
men
myself
among
them
took
it
for
granted
that
as
missouri
was
a
slave
state
the
inhabitants
must
all
be
secessionists
and
therefore
our
enemies
a
man
by
the
name
of
chandler
proposed
that
we
organize
an
independent
company
for
the
purpose
of
invading
missouri
and
making
war
on
its
people
on
our
own
responsibility
he
at
once
went
about
it
in
a
very
quiet
way
and
succeeded
in
inducing
men
to
join
him
in
the
hazardous
enterprise
having
a
longing
and
revengeful
desire
to
retaliate
upon
the
missourians
for
the
brutal
manner
in
which
they
had
treated
and
robbed
my
family
i
became
a
member
of
chandler
company
his
plan
was
that
we
should
leave
our
homes
in
parties
of
not
more
than
two
or
three
together
and
meet
at
a
certain
point
near
westport
missouri
on
a
fixed
day
his
instructions
were
carried
out
to
the
letter
and
we
met
at
the
rendezvous
at
the
appointed
time
chandler
had
been
there
some
days
before
us
and
thoroughly
disguised
had
been
looking
around
the
country
for
the
whereabouts
of
all
the
best
horses
he
directed
us
to
secretly
visit
certain
farms
and
collect
all
the
horses
possible
and
bring
them
together
the
next
night
this
we
did
and
upon
reassembling
it
was
found
that
nearly
every
man
had
two
horses
we
immediately
struck
out
for
the
kansas
line
which
we
crossed
at
an
indian
ferry
on
the
kansas
river
above
wyandotte
and
as
soon
as
we
had
set
foot
upon
kansas
soil
we
separated
with
the
understanding
that
we
were
to
meet
one
week
from
that
day
at
leavenworth
illustration
nearly
every
man
had
two
horses
some
of
the
parties
boldly
took
their
confiscated
horses
into
leavenworth
while
others
rode
them
to
their
homes
this
action
may
look
to
the
reader
like
and
some
people
might
not
hesitate
to
call
it
by
that
name
but
chandler
plausibly
maintained
that
we
were
only
getting
back
our
own
or
the
equivalent
from
the
missourians
and
as
the
government
was
waging
war
against
the
south
it
was
perfectly
square
and
honest
and
we
had
a
good
right
to
do
it
so
we
did
let
our
consciences
trouble
us
very
much
we
continued
to
make
similar
raids
upon
the
missourians
off
and
on
during
the
summer
and
occasionally
we
had
running
fights
with
them
none
of
the
skirmishes
however
amounting
to
much
the
government
officials
hearing
of
our
operations
put
detectives
upon
our
track
and
several
of
the
party
were
arrested
my
mother
upon
learning
that
i
was
engaged
in
this
business
told
me
it
was
neither
honorable
nor
right
and
she
would
not
for
a
moment
countenance
any
such
proceedings
consequently
i
abandoned
the
enterprise
for
such
it
really
was
about
this
time
the
government
bought
from
jones
and
cartwright
several
which
were
sent
to
rolla
missouri
all
being
put
in
charge
of
my
old
and
gallant
friend
wild
bill
who
had
just
become
the
hero
of
the
day
on
account
of
a
terrible
fight
which
he
had
had
with
a
gang
of
desperadoes
and
outlaws
who
infested
the
border
under
the
leadership
of
the
then
notorious
jake
mccandless
in
this
fight
he
had
killed
mccandless
and
three
of
his
men
the
affair
occurred
while
wild
bill
was
riding
the
pony
express
in
western
kansas
the
custom
with
the
express
riders
when
within
half
a
mile
of
a
station
was
either
to
begin
shouting
or
blowing
a
horn
in
order
to
notify
the
stock
tender
of
his
approach
and
to
have
a
fresh
horse
already
saddled
for
him
on
his
arrival
so
that
he
could
go
right
on
without
a
moment
delay
one
day
as
wild
bill
neared
rock
creek
station
where
he
was
to
change
horses
he
began
shouting
as
usual
at
the
proper
distance
but
the
who
had
been
married
only
a
short
time
and
had
his
wife
living
with
him
at
the
station
did
not
make
his
accustomed
appearance
wild
bill
galloped
up
and
instead
of
finding
the
ready
for
him
with
a
fresh
horse
he
discovered
him
lying
across
the
stable
door
with
the
blood
oozing
from
a
in
his
head
the
man
was
dead
and
it
was
evident
that
he
had
been
killed
only
a
few
moments
before
in
a
second
wild
bill
jumped
from
his
horse
and
looking
in
the
direction
of
the
house
he
saw
a
man
coming
towards
him
the
approaching
man
fired
on
him
at
once
but
missed
his
aim
quick
as
lightning
wild
bill
pulled
his
revolver
and
returned
the
fire
the
stranger
fell
dead
shot
through
the
brain
bill
bill
help
help
save
me
such
was
the
cry
that
bill
now
heard
it
was
the
shrill
and
pitiful
voice
of
the
dead
wife
and
it
came
from
a
window
of
the
house
she
had
heard
the
exchange
of
shots
and
knew
that
wild
bill
had
arrived
he
dashed
over
the
dead
body
of
the
villain
whom
he
had
killed
and
just
as
he
sprang
into
the
door
of
the
house
he
saw
two
powerful
men
assaulting
the
woman
one
of
the
desperadoes
was
in
the
act
of
striking
her
with
the
butt
end
of
a
revolver
and
while
his
arm
was
still
raised
bill
sent
a
ball
crashing
through
his
skull
killing
him
instantly
two
other
men
now
came
rushing
from
an
adjoining
room
and
bill
seeing
that
the
odds
were
three
to
one
against
him
jumped
into
a
corner
and
then
firing
he
killed
another
of
the
villains
before
he
could
shoot
again
the
remaining
two
men
closed
in
upon
him
one
of
whom
had
drawn
a
large
bowie
knife
bill
wrenched
the
knife
from
his
grasp
and
drove
it
through
the
heart
of
the
outlaw
illustration
wild
bill
and
the
outlaws
the
fifth
and
last
man
now
grabbed
bill
by
the
throat
and
held
him
at
arm
length
but
it
was
only
for
a
moment
as
bill
raised
his
own
powerful
right
arm
and
struck
his
antagonist
left
arm
such
a
terrible
blow
that
he
broke
it
the
disabled
desperado
seeing
that
he
was
no
longer
a
match
for
bill
jumped
through
the
door
and
mounting
a
horse
he
succeeded
in
making
his
escape
being
the
sole
survivor
of
the
jake
mccandless
gang
wild
bill
remained
at
the
station
with
the
terrified
woman
until
the
stage
came
along
and
he
then
consigned
her
to
the
care
of
the
driver
mounting
his
horse
he
at
once
galloped
off
and
soon
disappeared
in
the
distance
making
up
for
lost
time
this
was
the
exploit
that
was
on
everybody
tongue
and
in
every
newspaper
it
was
one
of
the
most
remarkable
and
desperate
hand
to
hand
encounters
that
has
ever
taken
place
on
the
border
i
happened
to
meet
wild
bill
at
leavenworth
as
he
was
about
to
depart
for
rolla
he
wished
me
to
take
charge
of
the
government
trains
as
a
sort
of
assistant
under
him
and
i
gladly
accepted
the
offer
arriving
at
rolla
we
loaded
the
trains
with
freight
and
took
them
to
springfield
missouri
on
our
return
to
rolla
we
heard
a
great
deal
of
talk
about
the
approaching
fall
races
at
louis
and
wild
bill
having
brought
a
fast
running
horse
from
the
mountains
determined
to
take
him
to
that
city
and
match
him
against
some
of
the
there
and
down
to
louis
we
went
with
this
running
horse
placing
our
hopes
very
high
on
him
wild
bill
had
no
difficulty
in
making
up
a
race
for
him
all
the
money
that
he
and
i
had
we
put
up
on
the
mountain
runner
and
as
we
thought
we
had
a
sure
thing
we
also
bet
the
horse
against
i
rode
the
horse
myself
but
nevertheless
our
sure
thing
like
many
another
sure
thing
proved
a
total
failure
and
we
came
out
of
that
race
minus
the
horse
and
every
dollar
we
had
in
the
world
before
the
race
it
had
been
make
or
break
with
us
and
we
got
broke
we
were
busted
in
the
largest
city
we
had
ever
been
in
and
it
is
no
exaggeration
to
say
that
we
felt
mighty
blue
on
the
morning
after
the
race
we
went
to
the
military
headquarters
where
bill
succeeded
in
securing
an
engagement
for
himself
as
a
government
scout
but
i
being
so
young
failed
in
obtaining
similar
employment
wild
bill
however
raised
some
money
by
borrowing
it
from
a
friend
and
then
buying
me
a
steamboat
ticket
he
sent
me
back
to
leavenworth
while
he
went
to
springfield
which
place
he
made
his
headquarters
while
scouting
in
southeastern
missouri
one
night
after
he
had
returned
from
a
scouting
expedition
he
took
a
hand
in
a
game
of
poker
and
in
the
course
of
the
game
he
became
involved
in
a
quarrel
with
dave
tutt
a
professional
gambler
about
a
watch
which
he
had
won
from
tutt
who
would
not
give
it
up
bill
told
him
he
had
won
it
fairly
and
that
he
proposed
to
have
it
furthermore
he
declared
his
intention
of
carrying
the
watch
across
the
street
next
morning
to
military
headquarters
at
which
place
he
had
to
report
at
nine
tutt
replied
that
he
would
himself
carry
the
watch
across
the
street
at
nine
and
no
other
man
would
do
it
bill
then
said
to
tutt
that
if
he
attempted
anything
of
the
kind
he
would
kill
him
a
challenge
to
a
duel
had
virtually
been
given
and
accepted
and
everybody
knew
that
the
two
men
meant
business
at
nine
the
next
morning
tutt
started
to
cross
the
street
wild
bill
who
was
standing
on
the
opposite
side
told
him
to
stop
at
that
moment
tutt
who
was
carrying
his
revolver
in
his
hand
fired
at
bill
but
missed
him
bill
quickly
pulled
out
his
revolver
and
returned
the
fire
hitting
tutt
squarely
in
the
forehead
and
killing
him
instantly
quite
a
number
of
tutt
friends
were
standing
in
the
vicinity
having
assembled
to
witness
the
duel
and
bill
as
soon
as
tutt
fell
to
the
ground
turned
to
them
and
asked
if
any
one
of
them
wanted
to
take
it
up
for
tutt
if
so
he
would
accommodate
any
of
them
then
and
there
but
none
of
them
cared
to
stand
in
front
of
wild
bill
to
be
shot
at
by
him
nothing
of
course
was
ever
done
to
bill
for
the
killing
of
tutt
chapter
xi
a
soldier
in
the
fall
of
i
made
a
trip
to
fort
larned
kansas
carrying
military
dispatches
and
in
the
winter
i
accompanied
george
long
through
the
country
and
assisted
him
in
buying
horses
for
the
government
the
next
spring
an
expedition
against
the
indians
was
organized
consisting
of
a
volunteer
regiment
the
ninth
kansas
under
colonel
clark
this
expedition
which
i
had
joined
in
the
capacity
of
guide
and
scout
proceeded
to
the
kiowa
and
comanche
country
on
the
arkansas
river
along
which
stream
we
scouted
all
summer
between
fort
lyon
and
fort
larned
on
the
old
santa
fe
trail
we
had
several
engagements
with
the
indians
but
they
were
of
no
great
importance
in
the
winter
of
i
became
one
of
the
red
legged
scouts
a
company
of
scouts
commanded
by
captain
tuff
among
its
members
were
some
of
the
most
noted
kansas
rangers
such
as
red
clark
the
clair
brothers
jack
harvey
an
old
pony
named
johnny
fry
and
many
other
well
known
frontiersmen
our
field
of
operations
was
confined
mostly
to
the
arkansas
country
and
southwestern
missouri
we
had
many
a
lively
skirmish
with
the
bushwhackers
and
younger
brothers
and
when
we
were
not
hunting
them
we
were
generally
employed
in
carrying
dispatches
between
forts
dodge
gibson
leavenworth
and
other
posts
whenever
we
were
in
leavenworth
we
had
a
very
festive
time
we
usually
attended
all
the
balls
in
full
force
and
ran
things
to
suit
ourselves
thus
i
passed
the
winter
of
and
the
spring
of
subsequently
i
engaged
to
conduct
a
small
train
to
denver
for
some
merchants
and
on
reaching
that
place
in
september
i
received
a
letter
stating
that
my
mother
was
not
expected
to
live
i
hastened
home
and
found
her
dangerously
she
grew
gradually
worse
and
at
last
on
the
of
november
she
died
thus
passed
away
a
loving
and
affectionate
mother
and
a
noble
brave
good
and
loyal
woman
that
i
loved
her
above
all
other
persons
no
one
who
has
read
these
reminiscences
can
for
a
moment
doubt
previous
to
this
said
event
my
sister
julia
had
been
married
to
a
gentleman
named
goodman
and
they
now
came
to
reside
at
our
house
and
take
charge
of
the
children
as
my
mother
had
desired
that
they
should
not
be
separated
goodman
became
the
guardian
of
the
minor
children
i
soon
left
the
home
now
rendered
gloomy
by
the
absence
of
her
whom
i
had
so
tenderly
loved
and
going
to
leavenworth
i
entered
upon
a
dissolute
and
reckless
life
to
my
shame
be
it
said
and
associated
with
gamblers
drunkards
and
bad
characters
generally
i
continued
my
dissipation
about
two
months
and
was
becoming
a
very
hard
case
about
this
time
the
seventh
kansas
regiment
known
as
jennison
returned
from
the
war
and
and
as
veterans
among
them
i
met
quite
a
number
of
my
old
comrades
and
neighbors
who
tried
to
induce
me
to
enlist
and
go
south
with
them
i
had
no
idea
of
doing
anything
of
the
kind
but
one
day
after
having
been
under
the
influence
of
bad
whisky
i
awoke
to
find
myself
a
soldier
in
the
seventh
kansas
i
did
not
remember
how
or
when
i
had
enlisted
but
i
saw
i
was
in
for
it
and
that
it
would
not
do
for
me
to
endeavor
to
back
out
in
the
spring
of
the
regiment
was
ordered
to
tennessee
and
we
got
into
memphis
just
about
the
time
that
general
sturgis
was
so
badly
whipped
by
general
forrest
general
smith
the
army
to
operate
against
forrest
and
after
marching
to
tupalo
mississippi
we
had
an
engagement
with
him
and
defeated
him
this
kind
of
fighting
was
all
new
to
me
being
entirely
different
from
any
in
which
i
had
ever
before
engaged
i
soon
became
a
officer
and
was
put
on
detached
service
as
a
scout
after
skirmishing
around
the
country
with
the
rest
of
the
army
for
some
little
time
our
regiment
returned
to
memphis
but
was
immediately
ordered
to
cape
girardeau
in
missouri
as
a
confederate
force
under
general
price
was
then
raiding
that
state
the
command
of
which
my
regiment
was
a
part
hurried
to
the
front
to
intercept
price
and
our
first
fight
with
him
occurred
at
pilot
knob
from
that
time
for
nearly
six
weeks
we
fought
or
skirmished
every
day
i
was
still
acting
as
a
scout
when
one
day
i
rode
ahead
of
the
command
some
considerable
distance
to
pick
up
all
possible
information
concerning
price
movements
i
was
dressed
in
gray
clothes
or
missouri
jeans
and
on
riding
up
to
a
and
entering
i
saw
a
man
also
dressed
in
gray
costume
sitting
at
a
table
eating
bread
and
milk
he
looked
up
as
i
entered
and
startled
me
by
saying
you
little
rascal
what
are
you
doing
in
those
clothes
judge
of
my
surprise
when
i
recognized
in
the
stranger
my
old
friend
and
partner
wild
bill
disguised
as
a
confederate
officer
i
ask
you
the
same
question
sir
said
i
without
the
least
hesitation
hush
sit
down
and
have
some
bread
and
milk
and
we
talk
it
all
over
afterwards
said
he
i
accepted
the
invitation
and
partook
of
the
refreshments
wild
bill
paid
the
woman
of
the
house
and
we
went
out
to
the
gate
where
my
horse
was
standing
billy
my
boy
said
he
i
am
mighty
glad
to
see
you
i
have
seen
or
heard
of
you
since
we
got
busted
on
that
louis
what
are
you
doing
out
here
i
asked
i
am
a
scout
under
general
mcniel
for
the
last
few
days
i
have
been
with
general
marmaduke
division
of
price
army
in
disguise
as
a
southern
officer
from
texas
as
you
see
me
now
said
he
that
exactly
the
kind
of
business
that
i
am
out
on
said
i
and
i
want
to
get
some
information
concerning
price
movements
i
give
you
all
that
i
have
and
he
then
went
on
and
told
me
all
that
he
knew
regarding
price
intentions
and
the
number
and
condition
of
his
men
he
then
asked
about
my
mother
and
when
he
learned
that
she
was
dead
he
was
greatly
surprised
and
grieved
he
thought
a
great
deal
of
her
for
she
had
treated
him
almost
as
one
of
her
own
children
he
finally
took
out
a
package
which
he
had
concealed
about
his
person
and
handing
it
to
me
he
said
here
are
some
letters
which
i
want
you
to
give
to
general
mcniel
all
right
said
i
as
i
took
them
but
where
will
i
meet
you
again
never
mind
that
he
replied
i
am
getting
so
much
valuable
information
that
i
propose
to
stay
a
little
while
longer
in
this
disguise
thereupon
we
shook
hands
and
parted
it
is
not
necessary
to
say
much
concerning
price
raid
in
general
as
that
event
is
a
matter
of
recorded
history
i
am
only
relating
the
incidents
in
which
i
was
personally
interested
either
as
one
of
the
actors
or
as
an
observer
another
interesting
and
i
may
say
exciting
episode
happened
to
me
a
day
or
two
after
my
unexpected
meeting
with
wild
bill
i
was
riding
with
the
advance
guard
of
our
army
and
wishing
a
drink
of
water
i
stopped
at
a
farmhouse
there
were
no
men
about
the
premises
and
no
one
excepting
a
very
fine
and
intellectual
looking
lady
and
her
two
daughters
they
seemed
to
be
almost
frightened
to
death
at
seeing
me
a
yank
appear
before
them
i
quieted
their
fears
somewhat
and
the
mother
then
asked
me
how
far
back
the
army
was
when
i
told
her
it
would
be
along
shortly
she
expressed
her
fears
that
they
would
take
everything
on
the
premises
they
set
me
out
a
lunch
and
treated
me
rather
kindly
so
that
i
really
began
to
sympathize
with
them
for
i
knew
that
the
soldiers
would
ransack
their
house
and
confiscate
everything
they
could
lay
their
hands
on
at
last
i
resolved
to
do
what
i
could
to
protect
them
after
the
generals
and
the
staff
officers
had
passed
by
i
took
it
upon
myself
to
be
a
sentry
over
the
house
when
the
command
came
along
some
of
the
men
rushed
up
with
the
intention
of
entering
the
place
and
carrying
off
all
the
desirable
plunder
possible
and
then
tearing
and
breaking
everything
to
pieces
as
they
usually
did
along
the
line
of
march
halt
i
shouted
i
have
been
placed
here
by
the
commanding
officer
as
a
guard
over
this
house
and
no
man
must
enter
it
this
stopped
the
first
squad
and
seeing
that
my
plan
was
a
success
i
remained
at
my
post
during
the
passage
of
the
entire
command
and
kept
out
all
intruders
it
seemed
as
if
the
ladies
could
not
thank
me
sufficiently
for
the
protection
i
had
afforded
them
they
were
perfectly
aware
of
the
fact
that
i
had
acted
without
orders
and
entirely
on
my
own
responsibility
and
therefore
they
felt
the
more
grateful
they
urgently
invited
me
to
remain
a
little
while
longer
and
partake
of
an
excellent
dinner
which
they
said
they
were
preparing
for
me
i
was
pretty
hungry
about
that
time
as
our
rations
had
been
rather
slim
of
late
and
a
good
dinner
was
a
temptation
i
could
not
withstand
especially
as
it
was
to
be
served
up
by
such
elegant
ladies
while
i
was
eating
the
meal
i
was
most
agreeably
entertained
by
the
young
ladies
and
before
i
had
finished
it
the
last
of
the
must
have
been
at
least
two
miles
from
the
house
suddenly
three
men
entered
the
room
and
i
looked
up
and
saw
three
leveled
straight
at
me
before
i
could
speak
however
the
mother
and
her
daughters
sprang
between
the
men
and
me
father
boys
lower
your
guns
you
must
not
shoot
this
man
and
similar
exclamations
were
the
cry
of
all
three
the
guns
were
lowered
and
then
the
men
who
were
the
father
and
brothers
of
the
young
ladies
were
informed
of
what
i
had
done
for
them
it
appeared
that
they
had
been
concealed
in
the
woods
near
by
while
the
army
was
passing
and
on
coming
into
the
house
and
finding
a
yankee
there
they
determined
to
shoot
him
upon
learning
the
facts
the
old
man
extended
his
hand
to
me
saying
i
would
not
harm
a
hair
of
your
head
for
the
world
but
it
is
best
that
you
stay
here
no
longer
as
your
command
is
some
distance
from
here
now
and
you
might
be
cut
off
by
bushwhackers
before
reaching
it
bidding
them
all
and
with
many
thanks
from
the
mother
and
daughters
i
mounted
my
horse
and
soon
overtook
the
column
happy
in
the
thought
that
i
had
done
a
good
deed
and
with
no
regrets
that
i
had
saved
from
pillage
and
destruction
the
home
and
property
of
a
confederate
and
his
family
our
command
kept
crowding
against
price
and
his
army
until
they
were
pushed
into
the
vicinity
of
kansas
city
where
their
further
advance
was
checked
by
united
states
troops
from
kansas
and
then
was
begun
their
memorable
and
extraordinary
retreat
back
into
kansas
while
both
armies
were
drawn
up
in
skirmish
line
near
fort
scott
kansas
two
men
on
horseback
were
seen
rapidly
leaving
the
confederate
lines
and
suddenly
they
made
a
dash
towards
us
instantly
quick
volleys
were
discharged
from
the
confederates
who
also
began
a
pursuit
and
some
five
hundred
shots
were
fired
at
the
flying
men
it
was
evident
that
they
were
trying
to
reach
our
lines
but
when
within
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
of
us
one
of
them
fell
from
his
horse
to
rise
no
more
he
had
been
fatally
shot
his
companion
galloped
on
unhurt
and
seven
companies
of
our
regiment
charged
out
and
met
him
and
checked
his
pursuers
the
fugitive
was
dressed
in
confederate
uniform
and
as
he
rode
into
our
lines
i
recognized
him
as
wild
bill
the
union
scout
he
immediately
sought
generals
pleasanton
and
mcniel
with
whom
he
held
a
consultation
he
told
them
that
although
price
made
a
bold
showing
on
the
front
by
bringing
all
his
men
into
view
yet
he
was
really
a
great
deal
weaker
than
the
appearance
of
his
lines
would
indicate
and
that
he
was
then
trying
to
cross
a
difficult
stream
four
miles
from
fort
scott
it
was
late
in
the
afternoon
but
general
pleasanton
immediately
ordered
an
advance
and
we
charged
in
full
force
upon
the
rear
of
price
army
and
drove
it
before
us
for
two
hours
if
wild
bill
could
have
made
his
successful
dash
into
our
lines
earlier
in
the
day
the
attack
would
have
been
made
sooner
and
greater
results
might
have
been
expected
the
confederates
had
suspected
him
of
being
a
spy
for
two
or
three
days
and
had
watched
him
too
closely
to
allow
an
opportunity
to
get
away
from
them
sooner
his
unfortunate
companion
who
had
been
shot
was
a
scout
from
springfield
missouri
whose
name
i
can
not
now
remember
from
this
time
on
wild
bill
and
myself
continued
to
scout
together
until
price
army
was
driven
south
of
the
arkansas
river
and
the
pursuit
abandoned
we
then
returned
to
springfield
missouri
for
a
rest
and
for
supplies
and
wild
bill
and
myself
spent
two
weeks
there
in
having
a
jolly
good
time
as
some
people
would
express
it
chapter
xii
a
wedding
it
was
during
the
winter
of
while
i
was
on
detached
service
at
military
headquarters
at
louis
that
i
became
acquainted
with
a
young
lady
named
louisa
frederici
whom
i
greatly
admired
and
in
whose
charming
society
i
spent
many
a
pleasant
hour
the
war
closing
in
i
was
discharged
and
after
a
brief
visit
at
leavenworth
i
returned
to
louis
having
made
up
my
mind
to
capture
the
heart
of
miss
frederici
whom
i
now
adored
above
any
other
young
lady
i
had
ever
seen
her
lovely
face
her
gentle
disposition
and
her
graceful
manners
won
my
admiration
and
love
and
i
was
not
slow
in
declaring
my
sentiments
to
her
the
result
was
that
i
obtained
her
consent
to
marry
me
in
the
near
future
and
when
i
bade
her
i
considered
myself
one
of
the
happiest
of
men
meantime
i
drove
a
string
of
horses
from
leavenworth
to
fort
kearney
where
i
met
my
old
friend
bill
trotter
who
was
then
division
stage
agent
he
employed
me
at
once
to
drive
stage
between
kearney
and
plum
creek
the
road
running
near
the
spot
where
i
had
my
first
indian
fight
with
the
mccarthy
brothers
and
where
i
killed
my
first
indian
nearly
nine
years
before
i
drove
stage
over
this
route
until
february
and
while
bounding
over
the
cold
dreary
road
day
after
day
my
thoughts
turned
continually
towards
my
promised
bride
until
i
at
last
determined
to
abandon
staging
forever
and
marry
and
settle
down
immediately
after
coming
to
this
conclusion
i
went
to
louis
where
i
was
most
cordially
received
by
my
sweetheart
it
was
arranged
between
us
that
our
wedding
should
take
place
on
the
day
of
march
following
at
last
the
day
arrived
and
the
wedding
ceremony
was
performed
at
the
residence
of
the
bride
parents
in
the
presence
of
a
large
number
of
invited
friends
whose
hearty
congratulations
we
received
i
was
certainly
to
be
congratulated
for
i
had
become
possessed
of
a
lovely
and
noble
woman
and
as
i
gazed
upon
her
as
she
stood
beside
me
arrayed
in
her
wedding
costume
i
indeed
felt
proud
of
her
and
from
that
time
to
this
i
have
always
thought
that
i
made
a
most
fortunate
choice
for
a
life
partner
an
hour
after
the
ceremony
we
my
bride
and
myself
were
on
board
of
a
missouri
river
steamboat
bound
for
our
new
home
in
kansas
my
parents
had
accompanied
us
to
the
boat
and
had
bidden
us
a
fond
farewell
and
a
on
our
journey
during
the
trip
up
the
river
several
very
amusing
yet
awkward
incidents
occurred
some
of
which
i
can
not
resist
relating
there
happened
to
be
on
board
the
boat
an
excursion
party
from
lexington
missouri
and
those
comprising
it
seemed
to
shun
me
for
some
reason
which
i
could
not
then
account
for
they
would
point
at
me
and
quietly
talk
among
themselves
and
eye
me
very
closely
their
actions
seemed
very
strange
to
me
after
the
boat
had
proceeded
some
little
distance
i
made
the
acquaintance
of
several
families
from
indiana
who
were
to
kansas
a
gentleman
who
seemed
to
be
the
leader
of
these
colonists
said
to
me
the
people
of
this
excursion
party
do
seem
to
have
any
great
love
for
you
what
does
it
mean
i
asked
what
are
they
saying
it
all
a
mystery
to
me
they
say
that
you
are
one
of
the
kansas
and
one
of
jennison
house
burners
replied
the
gentleman
i
am
from
kansas
that
true
and
was
a
soldier
and
a
scout
in
the
union
army
said
i
and
i
was
in
kansas
during
the
border
ruffian
war
of
perhaps
these
people
know
who
i
am
and
that
explains
their
hard
looks
i
had
a
lengthy
conversation
with
this
gentleman
for
such
he
seemed
to
be
and
entertained
him
with
several
chapters
of
the
history
of
the
early
kansas
troubles
and
told
him
the
experiences
of
my
own
family
in
the
evening
the
lexington
folks
got
up
a
dance
but
neither
the
indiana
people
my
wife
or
myself
were
invited
to
join
them
my
friend
thereupon
came
to
me
and
said
cody
let
us
have
a
dance
of
our
own
very
well
was
my
reply
we
have
some
musicians
along
with
us
so
we
can
have
plenty
of
music
remarked
the
gentleman
good
enough
said
i
and
i
will
hire
the
negro
barber
to
play
the
violin
for
us
he
is
a
good
fiddler
as
i
heard
him
playing
only
a
little
while
ago
the
result
was
that
we
soon
organized
a
good
string
band
and
had
a
splendid
dance
keeping
it
up
as
long
as
the
lexington
party
did
theirs
the
second
day
out
from
louis
the
boat
stopped
to
wood
up
at
a
landing
suddenly
twenty
horsemen
were
seen
galloping
up
through
the
timber
and
as
they
came
nearer
the
boat
they
fired
on
the
negro
deckhands
against
whom
they
seemed
to
have
a
special
grudge
and
who
were
engaged
in
throwing
wood
on
board
the
negroes
all
quickly
jumped
on
the
boat
and
pulled
in
the
gang
plank
and
the
captain
had
only
just
time
to
get
the
steamer
out
into
the
stream
before
the
bushwhackers
for
such
they
proved
to
be
appeared
on
the
bank
where
is
the
black
abolition
shouted
the
leader
show
him
to
us
and
we
shoot
him
yelled
another
but
as
the
boat
had
got
well
out
in
the
river
by
this
time
they
could
not
board
us
and
the
captain
ordering
a
full
head
of
steam
pulled
out
and
left
them
i
afterwards
ascertained
that
some
of
the
missourians
who
were
with
the
excursion
party
were
bushwhackers
themselves
and
had
telegraphed
to
their
friends
from
some
previous
landing
that
i
was
on
board
telling
them
to
come
to
the
landing
which
we
had
just
left
and
take
me
off
had
the
villains
captured
me
they
would
have
undoubtedly
put
an
end
to
my
career
and
the
public
would
never
have
had
the
pleasure
of
being
bored
by
this
autobiography
i
noticed
that
my
wife
felt
grieved
over
the
manner
in
which
these
people
had
treated
me
just
married
she
was
going
into
a
new
country
and
seeing
how
her
husband
was
regarded
how
he
had
been
shunned
and
how
his
life
had
been
threatened
i
was
afraid
she
might
come
to
the
conclusion
too
soon
that
she
had
wedded
a
hard
customer
so
when
the
boat
landed
at
kansas
city
i
telegraphed
to
some
of
my
friends
in
leavenworth
that
i
would
arrive
there
in
the
evening
my
object
was
to
have
my
acquaintances
give
me
a
reception
so
that
my
wife
could
see
that
i
really
did
have
some
friends
and
was
not
so
bad
a
man
as
the
bushwhackers
tried
to
make
out
just
as
i
expected
when
the
boat
reached
leavenworth
i
found
a
general
of
friends
at
the
landing
to
receive
us
there
were
about
sixty
gentlemen
and
ladies
they
had
a
band
of
music
with
them
and
we
were
given
a
fine
serenade
taking
carriages
we
all
drove
to
south
leavenworth
to
the
home
of
my
sister
eliza
who
had
married
george
myers
and
there
we
were
given
a
very
handsome
reception
all
this
cheered
up
my
wife
who
concluded
that
i
was
not
a
desperado
after
all
having
promised
my
wife
that
i
would
abandon
the
plains
i
rented
a
hotel
in
salt
creek
valley
the
same
house
by
the
way
which
my
mother
had
formerly
kept
but
which
was
then
owned
by
crook
late
surgeon
of
the
kansas
this
hotel
i
called
the
golden
rule
house
and
i
kept
it
until
the
next
september
people
generally
said
i
made
a
good
landlord
and
knew
how
to
run
a
hotel
a
business
qualification
which
it
is
said
is
possessed
by
comparatively
few
men
but
it
proved
too
tame
employment
for
me
and
again
i
sighed
for
the
freedom
of
the
plains
believing
that
i
could
make
more
money
out
west
on
the
frontier
than
i
could
at
salt
creek
valley
i
sold
out
the
golden
rule
house
and
started
alone
for
saline
kansas
which
was
then
the
end
of
the
track
of
the
kansas
pacific
railway
which
was
at
that
time
being
built
across
the
plains
on
my
way
i
stopped
at
junction
city
where
i
again
met
my
old
friend
wild
bill
who
was
scouting
for
the
government
his
headquarters
being
at
fort
ellsworth
afterwards
called
fort
harker
he
told
me
that
they
needed
more
scouts
at
this
post
and
i
accordingly
accompanied
him
to
that
fort
where
i
had
no
difficulty
in
obtaining
employment
during
the
winter
of
i
scouted
between
fort
ellsworth
and
fort
fletcher
in
the
spring
of
i
was
at
fort
fletcher
when
general
custer
came
out
to
go
on
an
indian
expedition
with
general
hancock
i
remained
at
this
post
until
it
was
drowned
out
by
the
heavy
floods
of
big
creek
on
which
it
was
located
the
water
rose
about
the
fortifications
and
rendered
the
place
unfit
for
occupancy
so
the
government
abandoned
the
fort
and
moved
the
troops
and
supplies
to
a
new
post
which
had
been
named
fort
hays
located
further
west
on
the
south
fork
of
big
creek
it
was
while
scouting
in
the
vicinity
of
fort
hays
that
i
had
my
first
ride
with
the
dashing
and
gallant
custer
who
had
come
up
to
the
post
from
fort
ellsworth
with
an
escort
of
only
ten
men
he
wanted
a
guide
to
pilot
him
to
fort
larned
a
distance
of
miles
across
the
country
i
was
ordered
by
the
commanding
officer
to
guide
general
custer
to
his
desired
destination
and
i
soon
received
word
from
the
general
that
he
would
start
out
in
the
morning
with
the
intention
of
making
the
trip
in
one
day
early
in
the
morning
after
a
good
night
rest
i
was
on
hand
mounted
on
my
large
mule
an
animal
of
great
endurance
and
ready
for
the
journey
when
the
general
saw
me
he
said
cody
i
want
to
travel
fast
and
go
through
as
quickly
as
possible
and
i
do
think
that
mule
of
yours
is
fast
enough
to
suit
me
general
never
mind
the
mule
said
i
he
get
there
as
soon
as
your
horses
that
mule
is
a
good
one
as
i
knew
that
the
animal
was
better
than
most
horses
very
well
go
ahead
then
said
he
though
he
looked
as
if
he
thought
i
would
delay
the
party
on
the
road
for
the
first
fifteen
miles
until
we
came
to
the
smoky
hill
river
which
we
were
to
cross
i
could
hardly
keep
the
mule
in
advance
of
the
general
who
rode
a
frisky
impatient
and
ambitious
thoroughbred
steed
in
fact
the
whole
party
was
finely
mounted
the
general
repeatedly
told
me
that
the
mule
was
no
good
and
that
i
ought
to
have
had
a
good
horse
but
after
crossing
the
river
and
striking
the
i
began
letting
my
mule
out
a
little
and
putting
the
persuaders
to
him
he
was
soon
the
horses
and
by
the
time
we
had
made
about
half
the
distance
to
fort
larned
i
occasionally
had
to
wait
for
the
general
or
some
of
his
party
as
their
horses
were
beginning
to
show
signs
of
fatigue
general
how
about
this
mule
anyhow
i
asked
at
last
cody
you
have
a
better
vehicle
than
i
thought
you
had
was
his
reply
from
that
time
on
to
fort
larned
i
had
no
trouble
in
keeping
ahead
of
the
party
we
rode
into
the
fort
at
four
in
the
afternoon
with
about
half
the
escort
only
the
rest
having
lagged
far
behind
general
custer
thanked
me
for
having
brought
him
straight
across
the
country
without
any
trail
and
said
that
if
i
were
not
engaged
as
post
scout
at
fort
hays
he
would
like
to
have
me
accompany
him
as
one
of
his
scouts
during
the
summer
and
he
added
that
whenever
i
was
out
of
employment
if
i
would
come
to
him
he
would
find
something
for
me
to
do
this
was
the
beginning
of
my
acquaintance
with
general
custer
whom
i
always
admired
as
a
man
and
as
an
officer
illustration
general
custer
a
few
days
after
my
return
to
fort
hays
the
indians
made
a
raid
on
the
kansas
pacific
railroad
killing
five
or
six
men
and
running
off
about
one
hundred
horses
and
mules
the
news
was
brought
to
the
commanding
officer
who
immediately
ordered
major
arms
of
the
tenth
cavalry
which
by
the
way
was
a
negro
regiment
with
his
company
and
one
mountain
howitzer
to
go
in
pursuit
of
the
and
i
was
sent
along
with
the
expedition
as
scout
and
guide
on
the
second
day
out
we
suddenly
discovered
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
saline
river
about
a
mile
distant
a
large
body
of
indians
who
were
charging
down
upon
us
major
arms
placing
the
cannon
on
a
little
knoll
limbered
it
up
and
left
twenty
men
to
guard
it
and
then
with
the
rest
of
the
command
he
crossed
the
river
to
meet
the
indians
just
as
he
had
got
the
men
over
the
stream
we
heard
a
terrific
yelling
and
shouting
in
our
rear
and
looking
back
to
the
knoll
where
the
cannon
had
been
stationed
we
saw
the
negroes
who
had
been
left
there
to
guard
the
gun
flying
towards
us
being
pursued
by
about
one
hundred
indians
while
another
large
party
of
the
latter
were
dancing
around
the
captured
cannon
as
if
they
had
got
hold
of
an
elephant
and
did
not
know
what
to
do
with
it
major
arms
turned
his
command
back
and
drove
the
indians
from
the
gun
the
troops
then
dismounted
and
took
position
there
quite
a
severe
fight
ensued
lasting
about
two
hours
five
or
six
of
the
soldiers
as
well
as
major
arms
were
wounded
and
several
of
the
horses
were
shot
the
indians
seemed
to
grow
thicker
and
thicker
as
if
receiving
reinforcements
from
some
large
party
the
colored
troops
who
had
been
bragging
all
the
way
that
if
they
could
only
see
some
indians
dey
would
blow
off
de
farm
which
was
a
favorite
expression
of
theirs
were
now
singing
a
different
tune
every
time
the
indians
would
make
a
charge
at
us
the
darkeys
would
cry
out
heah

many
other
similar
expressions
major
arms
who
was
wounded
and
lying
under
the
cannon
which
by
the
way
had
become
useless
called
me
up
and
asked
if
i
thought
there
was
any
show
of
getting
back
to
the
fort
i
replied
that
there
was
orders
were
accordingly
given
by
major
arms
for
a
retreat
the
cannon
being
left
behind
during
the
movement
several
of
our
men
were
killed
but
as
night
came
and
dense
darkness
prevailed
we
succeeded
in
making
good
headway
and
got
into
fort
hays
just
at
daylight
next
morning
in
a
very
condition
during
our
absence
the
cholera
had
broken
out
at
the
post
and
five
or
six
men
were
dying
daily
it
was
difficult
to
tell
which
was
the
greater
danger
fighting
indians
on
the
prairie
or
facing
the
cholera
in
camp
but
the
former
was
decidedly
the
more
inviting
chapter
xiii
a
millionaire
soon
after
returning
to
fort
hays
i
was
sent
with
dispatches
to
fort
harker
after
delivering
the
messages
i
visited
the
town
of
ellsworth
about
three
miles
west
of
fort
harker
and
there
i
met
a
man
named
william
rose
a
contractor
on
the
kansas
pacific
railroad
who
had
a
contract
for
grading
near
fort
hays
he
had
had
his
stock
stolen
by
the
indians
and
had
come
to
ellsworth
to
buy
more
during
the
course
of
our
conversation
rose
incidentally
remarked
that
he
had
some
idea
of
laying
out
a
town
on
the
west
side
of
big
creek
about
one
mile
from
the
fort
where
the
railroad
was
to
cross
he
asked
my
opinion
of
the
contemplated
enterprise
and
i
told
him
that
i
thought
it
was
a
big
thing
he
then
proposed
taking
me
as
a
partner
in
the
scheme
and
suggested
that
after
we
got
the
town
laid
out
and
thrown
open
to
the
public
we
should
establish
a
store
and
saloon
there
thinking
it
would
be
a
grand
thing
to
be
of
a
town
i
at
once
accepted
his
proposition
we
bought
a
stock
of
such
articles
as
are
usually
found
in
a
frontier
store
and
transported
them
to
the
place
on
big
creek
where
we
were
to
found
our
town
we
hired
a
railroad
engineer
to
survey
the
site
and
stake
it
off
into
lots
and
we
gave
the
new
town
the
ancient
and
historical
name
of
rome
to
a
starter
we
donated
lots
to
any
one
who
would
build
on
them
but
reserved
the
corner
lots
and
others
which
were
best
located
for
ourselves
these
reserved
lots
we
valued
at
fifty
dollars
each
our
modern
rome
like
all
mushroom
towns
along
the
line
of
a
new
railroad
sprang
up
as
if
by
magic
and
in
less
than
one
month
we
had
two
hundred
frame
and
log
houses
three
or
four
stores
several
saloons
and
one
good
hotel
rome
was
looming
up
and
rose
and
i
already
considered
ourselves
millionaires
and
thought
we
had
the
world
by
the
tail
but
one
day
a
gentleman
calling
himself
webb
appeared
in
town
and
dropping
into
our
store
introduced
himself
in
a
very
pleasant
way
gentlemen
you
got
a
very
flourishing
little
town
here
would
you
like
to
have
a
partner
in
your
enterprise
no
thank
you
said
i
we
have
too
good
a
thing
here
to
whack
up
with
anybody
my
partner
agreed
with
me
but
the
conversation
was
continued
and
at
last
the
stranger
said
gentlemen
i
am
the
agent
or
prospector
of
the
kansas
pacific
railroad
and
my
business
is
to
locate
towns
for
the
company
along
the
line
we
think
we
have
the
only
suitable
in
this
immediate
locality
said
rose
and
as
a
town
is
already
started
we
have
saved
the
company
considerable
expense
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
said
webb
that
the
company
expects
to
make
money
by
selling
lands
and
town
lots
and
as
you
are
not
disposed
to
give
the
company
a
show
or
share
with
me
i
shall
probably
have
to
start
another
town
near
you
competition
is
the
life
of
trade
you
know
start
your
town
if
you
want
to
we
got
the
on
you
and
can
hold
it
said
i
somewhat
provoked
at
his
threat
but
we
acted
too
independently
and
too
indiscreetly
for
our
own
good
webb
the
very
next
day
after
his
interview
with
us
began
hauling
material
to
a
spot
about
one
mile
east
of
us
where
he
staked
out
a
new
town
which
he
called
hays
city
he
took
great
pains
to
circulate
in
our
town
the
story
that
the
railroad
company
would
locate
their
and
machine
shops
at
hays
city
and
that
it
was
to
be
town
and
a
splendid
business
center
a
ruinous
stampede
from
our
place
was
the
result
people
who
had
built
in
rome
came
to
the
conclusion
that
they
had
built
in
the
wrong
place
they
began
pulling
down
their
buildings
and
moving
them
over
to
hays
city
and
in
less
than
three
days
our
once
flourishing
city
had
dwindled
down
to
the
little
store
which
rose
and
i
had
built
it
was
on
a
bright
summer
morning
that
we
sat
on
a
pine
box
in
front
of
our
crib
moodily
viewing
the
demolition
of
the
last
building
three
days
before
we
had
considered
ourselves
millionaires
on
that
morning
we
looked
around
and
saw
that
we
were
reduced
to
the
ragged
edge
of
poverty
our
sanguine
expectations
of
realizing
immense
fortunes
were
dashed
to
the
ground
and
we
felt
pretty
blue
the
new
town
of
hays
had
swallowed
rome
entirely
rose
facetiously
remarked
that
he
felt
like
the
last
rose
of
summer
with
all
his
lovely
companions
faded
and
gone
and
left
blooming
alone
i
told
him
i
was
still
there
staunch
and
true
but
he
replied
that
that
did
help
the
matter
much
thus
ends
the
brief
history
of
the
rise
decline
and
fall
of
modern
rome
it
having
become
evident
to
me
that
there
was
very
little
hope
of
rome
ever
regaining
its
former
splendor
and
prosperity
i
sent
my
wife
and
daughter
arta
who
had
been
born
at
leavenworth
in
the
latter
part
of
december
to
louis
on
a
visit
they
had
been
living
with
me
for
some
little
time
in
the
rear
part
of
our
store
at
this
time
rose
and
myself
had
a
contract
under
schumacher
miller
constructors
of
the
kansas
pacific
for
grading
five
miles
of
track
westward
from
big
creek
and
running
through
the
site
of
rome
notwithstanding
we
had
been
deserted
we
had
some
small
hope
that
they
would
not
be
able
to
get
water
at
the
new
town
and
that
the
people
would
all
soon
move
back
to
rome
as
we
really
had
the
best
location
we
determined
therefore
to
go
on
with
our
grading
contract
and
wait
for
something
better
to
turn
up
it
was
indeed
hard
for
us
who
had
been
millionaires
to
come
down
to
the
level
of
common
railroad
contractors
but
we
had
to
do
it
all
the
same
we
visited
the
new
town
of
hays
almost
daily
to
see
how
it
was
progressing
and
in
a
short
time
we
became
much
better
acquainted
with
webb
who
had
reduced
us
from
our
late
independent
to
our
present
dependent
position
we
found
him
a
perfect
gentleman
a
fellow
whom
everybody
liked
and
respected
nearly
every
day
doc
and
i
would
take
a
ride
over
the
prairie
together
and
hunt
buffalo
on
one
occasion
having
ventured
about
ten
miles
from
the
town
we
spied
a
band
of
indians
not
over
two
miles
distant
who
were
endeavoring
to
get
between
us
and
the
town
and
thus
cut
us
off
i
was
mounted
on
my
celebrated
horse
brigham
the
fleetest
steed
i
ever
owned
on
several
subsequent
occasions
he
saved
my
life
and
he
was
the
horse
that
i
rode
when
i
killed
buffaloes
in
one
day
webb
was
riding
a
beautiful
thoroughbred
bay
which
he
had
brought
with
him
from
the
east
having
such
splendid
horses
we
laughed
at
the
idea
of
a
band
of
indians
overtaking
us
on
a
square
run
no
matter
how
well
they
might
be
mounted
but
not
caring
to
be
cut
off
by
them
we
ran
our
steeds
about
three
miles
towards
home
thus
getting
between
the
braves
and
the
town
the
indians
were
then
about
of
a
mile
distant
and
we
stopped
and
waved
our
hats
at
them
and
fired
some
shots
at
long
range
there
were
thirteen
in
the
party
and
as
they
were
getting
pretty
close
to
us
we
struck
out
for
hays
they
came
on
in
pursuit
and
sent
several
scattering
shots
after
us
but
we
easily
left
them
behind
they
finally
turned
and
rode
off
towards
the
saline
river
the
doctor
thought
this
glorious
sport
and
wanted
to
organize
a
party
to
go
in
pursuit
of
them
but
i
induced
him
to
give
up
this
idea
although
he
did
so
rather
reluctantly
the
doctor
soon
became
quite
an
expert
hunter
and
before
he
had
remained
on
the
prairie
a
year
there
were
but
few
men
in
the
country
who
could
kill
more
buffaloes
on
a
hunt
than
he
being
aware
that
rose
and
myself
felt
rather
downhearted
over
our
deserted
village
the
doctor
one
day
said
that
as
he
had
made
the
proprietors
of
rome
howl
he
would
give
us
two
lots
each
in
hays
and
did
so
we
finally
came
to
the
conclusion
that
our
old
town
was
dead
beyond
redemption
or
revival
and
we
thereupon
devoted
our
undivided
attention
to
our
railroad
contract
one
day
we
were
pushed
for
horses
to
work
on
our
scrapers
so
i
hitched
up
brigham
to
see
how
he
would
work
he
was
not
much
used
to
that
kind
of
labor
and
i
was
about
giving
up
the
idea
of
making
a
of
him
when
one
of
the
men
called
to
me
that
there
were
some
buffaloes
coming
over
the
hill
as
there
had
been
no
buffaloes
seen
anywhere
in
the
vicinity
of
the
camp
for
several
days
we
had
become
rather
short
of
meat
i
immediately
told
one
of
our
men
to
hitch
his
horses
to
a
wagon
and
follow
me
as
i
was
going
out
after
the
herd
and
we
would
bring
back
some
fresh
meat
for
supper
i
had
no
saddle
as
mine
had
been
left
at
the
camp
a
mile
distant
so
taking
the
harness
from
brigham
i
mounted
him
bareback
and
started
out
after
the
game
being
armed
with
my
celebrated
lucretia
borgia
a
needle
gun
which
i
had
obtained
from
the
government
while
i
was
riding
toward
the
buffaloes
i
observed
five
horsemen
coming
out
from
the
fort
who
had
evidently
seen
the
buffaloes
from
the
post
and
were
going
out
for
a
chase
they
proved
to
be
some
officers
in
that
part
of
the
country
and
when
they
came
up
closer
i
could
see
by
the
shoulder
straps
that
the
senior
officer
was
a
captain
while
the
others
were
lieutenants
hello
may
friend
sang
out
the
captain
i
see
you
are
after
the
same
game
we
are
yes
sir
i
saw
those
buffaloes
coming
over
the
hill
and
as
we
were
about
out
of
fresh
meat
i
thought
i
would
go
and
get
some
said
i
they
scanned
my
outfit
pretty
closely
and
as
my
horse
was
not
very
prepossessing
in
appearance
having
on
only
a
blind
bridle
and
otherwise
looking
like
a
they
evidently
considered
me
a
green
hand
at
hunting
do
you
expect
to
catch
those
buffaloes
on
that
gothic
steed
laughingly
asked
the
captain
i
hope
so
by
pushing
on
the
reins
hard
enough
was
my
reply
you
never
catch
them
in
the
world
my
fine
fellow
said
the
captain
it
requires
a
fast
horse
to
overtake
the
animals
on
these
prairies
does
it
asked
i
as
if
i
did
know
it
yes
but
come
along
with
us
as
we
are
going
to
kill
them
more
for
pleasure
than
anything
else
all
we
want
are
the
tongues
and
a
piece
of
tender
loin
and
you
may
have
all
that
is
left
said
the
generous
man
i
am
much
obliged
to
you
captain
and
will
follow
you
i
replied
there
were
eleven
buffaloes
in
the
herd
and
they
were
not
more
than
a
mile
from
us
the
officers
dashed
ahead
as
if
they
had
a
sure
thing
on
killing
them
all
before
i
could
come
up
with
them
but
i
had
noticed
that
the
herd
was
making
towards
the
creek
for
water
and
as
i
knew
buffalo
nature
i
was
perfectly
aware
that
it
would
be
difficult
to
turn
them
from
their
direct
course
thereupon
i
started
towards
the
creek
to
head
them
off
while
the
officers
came
up
in
the
rear
and
gave
chase
the
buffaloes
came
rushing
past
me
not
a
hundred
yards
distant
with
the
officers
about
three
hundred
yards
in
the
rear
now
thought
i
is
the
time
to
get
my
work
in
as
they
say
and
i
pulled
the
from
my
horse
who
knew
as
well
as
i
did
that
we
were
out
for
buffaloes
as
he
was
a
trained
hunter
the
moment
the
bridle
was
off
he
started
at
the
top
of
his
speed
running
in
ahead
of
the
officers
and
with
a
few
jumps
he
brought
me
alongside
of
the
rear
buffalo
raising
old
lucretia
borgia
to
my
shoulder
i
fired
and
killed
the
animal
at
the
first
shot
my
horse
then
carried
me
alongside
the
next
one
not
ten
feet
away
and
i
dropped
him
at
the
next
fire
as
soon
as
one
buffalo
would
fall
brigham
would
take
me
so
close
to
the
next
that
i
could
almost
touch
it
with
my
gun
in
this
manner
i
killed
the
eleven
buffaloes
with
twelve
shots
and
as
the
last
animal
dropped
my
horse
stopped
i
jumped
to
the
ground
knowing
that
he
would
not
leave
me
it
must
be
remembered
that
i
had
been
riding
him
without
bridle
reins
or
saddle
and
turning
round
as
the
party
of
astonished
officers
rode
up
i
said
to
them
now
gentlemen
allow
me
to
present
to
you
all
the
tongues
and
you
wish
from
these
buffaloes
illustration
tongues
and
tender
loins
captain
graham
for
such
i
soon
learned
was
his
name
replied
well
i
never
saw
the
like
before
who
under
the
sun
are
you
anyhow
my
name
is
cody
said
i
one
of
the
lieutenants
thompson
by
name
who
had
met
me
at
fort
harker
then
recognized
me
and
said
why
that
is
bill
cody
our
old
scout
he
then
introduced
me
to
the
other
officers
who
were
captain
graham
of
the
tenth
cavalry
and
lieutenants
reed
emmick
and
ezekiel
captain
graham
who
was
considerable
of
a
horseman
greatly
admired
brigham
and
said
that
horse
of
yours
has
running
points
yes
sir
he
has
not
only
got
the
points
he
is
a
runner
and
knows
how
to
use
the
points
said
i
so
i
noticed
said
the
captain
they
all
finally
dismounted
and
we
continued
chatting
for
some
little
time
upon
the
different
subjects
of
horses
buffaloes
indians
and
hunting
they
felt
a
little
sore
at
not
getting
a
single
shot
at
the
buffaloes
but
the
way
i
had
killed
them
had
they
said
amply
repaid
them
for
their
disappointment
they
had
read
of
such
feats
in
books
but
this
was
the
first
time
they
had
ever
seen
anything
of
the
kind
with
their
own
eyes
it
was
the
first
time
also
that
they
had
ever
witnessed
or
heard
of
a
white
man
running
buffaloes
on
horseback
without
a
saddle
or
a
bridle
i
told
them
that
brigham
knew
nearly
as
much
about
the
business
as
i
did
and
if
i
had
had
twenty
bridles
they
would
have
been
of
no
use
to
me
as
he
understood
everything
and
all
that
he
expected
of
me
was
to
do
the
shooting
it
is
a
fact
that
brigham
would
stop
if
a
buffalo
did
not
fall
at
the
first
fire
so
as
to
give
me
a
second
chance
but
if
i
did
not
kill
the
buffalo
then
he
would
go
on
as
if
to
say
you
are
no
good
and
i
will
not
fool
away
time
by
giving
you
more
than
two
shots
brigham
was
the
best
horse
i
ever
owned
or
saw
for
buffalo
chasing
our
conversation
was
interrupted
in
a
little
while
by
the
arrival
of
the
wagon
which
i
had
ordered
out
i
loaded
the
of
the
youngest
buffaloes
on
it
and
then
cut
out
the
tongues
and
tender
loins
and
presented
them
to
the
officers
after
which
i
rode
towards
the
fort
with
them
while
the
wagon
returned
to
camp
captain
graham
told
me
that
he
expected
to
be
stationed
at
fort
hays
during
the
summer
and
would
probably
be
sent
out
on
a
scouting
expedition
and
in
case
he
was
he
would
like
to
have
me
accompany
him
as
scout
and
guide
i
replied
that
notwithstanding
i
was
very
busy
with
my
railroad
contract
i
would
go
with
him
if
he
was
ordered
out
i
then
left
the
officers
and
returned
to
our
camp
that
very
night
the
indians
unexpectedly
made
a
raid
on
the
horses
and
ran
off
five
or
six
of
our
very
best
leaving
us
in
a
very
crippled
condition
at
daylight
i
jumped
on
old
brigham
and
rode
to
fort
hays
when
i
reported
the
affair
to
the
commanding
officer
captain
graham
and
lieutenant
emmick
were
at
once
ordered
out
with
their
company
of
one
hundred
colored
troops
to
pursue
the
indians
and
recover
our
stock
if
possible
in
an
hour
we
were
under
way
the
darkies
had
never
been
in
an
indian
fight
and
were
anxious
to
catch
the
band
we
were
after
and
sweep
de
red
debels
from
off
de
face
ob
de
earth
captain
graham
was
a
brave
dashing
officer
eager
to
make
a
record
for
himself
and
it
was
with
difficulty
that
i
could
trail
fast
enough
to
keep
out
of
the
way
of
the
impatient
soldiers
every
few
moments
captain
graham
would
ride
up
to
see
if
the
trail
was
freshening
and
how
soon
we
should
be
likely
to
overtake
the
thieves
at
last
we
reached
the
saline
river
where
we
found
the
indians
had
only
stopped
to
feed
and
water
the
animals
and
had
then
pushed
on
towards
the
solomon
after
crossing
the
saline
they
made
no
effort
to
conceal
their
trail
thinking
they
would
not
be
pursued
beyond
that
point
consequently
we
were
able
to
make
excellent
time
we
reached
the
soloman
before
sunset
and
came
to
a
halt
we
surmised
that
if
the
indians
were
camped
on
this
river
that
they
had
no
suspicion
of
our
being
in
the
neighborhood
i
advised
captain
graham
to
remain
with
the
company
where
it
was
while
i
went
ahead
on
a
scout
to
find
the
indians
if
they
were
in
the
vicinity
after
riding
some
distance
down
the
ravine
that
led
to
the
river
i
left
my
horse
at
the
foot
of
a
hill
then
creeping
to
the
top
i
looked
cautiously
over
the
summit
upon
the
solomon
below
i
at
once
discovered
in
plain
view
not
a
mile
away
a
herd
of
horses
grazing
our
lost
ones
among
them
very
shortly
i
made
out
the
indian
camp
noted
its
lay
and
how
we
could
best
approach
it
reporting
to
captain
graham
whose
eyes
fairly
danced
with
delight
at
the
prospect
of
surprising
and
whipping
the
redskins
we
concluded
to
wait
until
the
moon
rose
then
get
into
the
timber
so
as
to
approach
the
indians
as
closely
as
possible
without
being
discovered
and
finally
to
make
a
sudden
dash
into
their
camp
and
clean
them
out
we
had
everything
cut
and
dried
as
we
thought
but
alas
just
as
we
were
nearing
the
point
where
we
were
to
take
the
open
ground
and
make
our
charge
one
of
the
colored
gentlemen
became
so
excited
that
he
fired
off
his
gun
we
immediately
commenced
the
charge
but
the
firing
of
the
gun
and
the
noise
of
our
rush
through
the
crackling
timber
alarmed
the
indians
who
at
once
sprang
to
their
horses
and
were
away
from
us
before
we
reached
their
late
camp
captain
graham
called
out
follow
me
boys
which
we
did
for
awhile
but
in
the
darkness
the
indians
made
good
their
escape
the
bugle
then
gave
the
but
some
of
the
darkies
did
not
get
back
until
morning
having
in
their
fright
allowed
their
horses
to
run
away
with
them
whithersoever
it
suited
the
animal
pleasure
to
go
illustration
the
indian
horse
thieves
we
followed
the
trail
the
next
day
for
awhile
but
as
it
become
evident
that
it
would
be
a
long
chase
to
overtake
the
enemy
and
as
we
had
rations
only
for
the
day
we
commenced
the
return
captain
graham
was
bitterly
disappointed
in
not
being
able
to
get
the
fight
when
it
seemed
so
near
at
one
time
he
roundly
cursed
the
nigger
who
fired
the
gun
and
as
a
punishment
for
his
carelessness
he
was
compelled
to
walk
all
the
way
back
to
fort
hays
chapter
xiv
earning
a
title
it
was
about
this
time
that
the
end
of
the
kansas
pacific
track
was
in
the
heart
of
the
buffalo
country
and
the
company
was
employing
about
twelve
hundred
men
in
the
construction
of
the
road
as
the
indians
were
very
troublesome
it
was
difficult
to
obtain
fresh
meat
for
the
workmen
and
the
company
therefore
concluded
to
engage
the
services
of
hunters
to
kill
buffaloes
having
heard
of
my
experience
and
success
as
a
buffalo
hunter
goddard
brothers
who
had
the
contract
for
boarding
the
employees
of
the
road
met
me
in
hays
city
one
day
and
made
me
a
good
offer
to
become
their
hunter
and
i
at
once
entered
into
a
contract
with
them
they
said
that
they
would
require
about
twelve
buffaloes
per
day
that
would
be
hams
as
we
took
only
the
and
hump
of
each
buffalo
as
this
was
to
be
dangerous
work
on
account
of
the
indians
who
were
riding
all
over
that
section
of
the
country
and
as
i
would
be
obliged
to
go
from
five
to
ten
miles
from
the
road
each
day
to
hunt
the
buffaloes
accompanied
by
only
one
man
with
a
light
wagon
for
the
transportation
of
the
meat
i
of
course
demanded
a
large
salary
they
could
afford
to
remunerate
me
well
because
the
meat
would
not
cost
them
anything
they
agreed
to
give
me
five
hundred
dollars
per
month
provided
i
furnished
them
all
the
fresh
meat
required
leaving
my
partner
rose
to
complete
our
grading
contract
i
immediately
began
my
career
as
a
buffalo
hunter
for
the
kansas
pacific
railroad
and
it
was
not
long
before
i
acquired
considerable
notoriety
it
was
at
this
time
that
the
very
appropriate
name
of
buffalo
bill
was
conferred
upon
me
by
the
it
has
stuck
to
me
ever
since
and
i
have
never
been
ashamed
of
it
during
my
engagement
as
hunter
for
the
company
a
period
of
less
than
eighteen
mouths
i
killed
buffaloes
and
i
had
many
exciting
adventures
with
the
indians
as
well
as
escapes
some
of
which
are
well
worth
relating
one
day
in
the
spring
of
i
mounted
brigham
and
started
for
smoky
hill
river
after
galloping
about
twenty
miles
i
reached
the
top
of
a
small
hill
overlooking
the
valley
of
that
beautiful
stream
as
i
was
gazing
on
the
landscape
i
suddenly
saw
a
band
of
about
thirty
indians
nearly
half
a
mile
distant
i
knew
by
the
way
they
jumped
on
their
horses
that
they
had
seen
me
as
soon
as
i
came
into
sight
the
only
chance
i
had
for
my
life
was
to
make
a
run
for
it
and
i
immediately
wheeled
and
started
back
towards
the
railroad
brigham
seemed
to
understand
what
was
up
and
he
struck
out
as
if
he
comprehended
that
it
was
to
be
a
run
for
life
he
crossed
a
ravine
in
a
few
jumps
and
on
reaching
a
ridge
beyond
i
drew
rein
looked
back
and
saw
the
indians
coming
for
me
at
full
speed
and
evidently
i
would
have
had
little
or
no
fear
of
being
overtaken
if
brigham
had
been
fresh
but
as
he
was
not
i
felt
uncertain
as
to
how
he
would
stand
a
long
chase
illustration
buffalo
bill
my
pursuers
seemed
to
be
gaining
on
me
a
little
and
i
let
brigham
shoot
ahead
again
when
we
had
run
about
three
miles
farther
some
eight
or
nine
of
the
indians
were
not
over
two
hundred
yards
behind
and
five
or
six
of
these
seemed
to
be
shortening
the
gap
at
every
jump
brigham
now
exerted
himself
more
than
ever
and
for
the
next
three
or
four
miles
he
got
right
down
to
business
and
did
some
of
the
prettiest
running
i
ever
saw
but
the
indians
were
about
as
as
i
was
and
one
of
their
horses
in
particular
a
spotted
animal
was
gaining
on
me
all
the
time
nearly
all
the
other
horses
were
strung
out
behind
for
a
distance
of
two
miles
but
still
chasing
after
me
illustration
down
went
his
horse
the
indian
who
was
riding
the
spotted
horse
was
armed
with
a
rifle
and
would
occasionally
send
a
bullet
whistling
along
sometimes
striking
the
ground
ahead
of
me
i
saw
that
this
fellow
must
be
checked
or
a
stray
bullet
from
his
gun
might
hit
me
or
my
horse
so
suddenly
stopping
brigham
and
quickly
wheeling
him
around
i
raised
old
lucretia
to
my
shoulder
took
deliberate
aim
at
the
indian
and
his
horse
hoping
to
hit
one
or
the
other
and
fired
he
was
not
over
eighty
yards
from
me
at
this
time
and
at
the
crack
of
my
rifle
down
went
his
horse
not
waiting
to
see
if
he
recovered
i
turned
brigham
and
in
a
moment
we
were
again
fairly
flying
towards
our
destination
we
had
urgent
business
about
that
time
and
were
in
a
hurry
to
get
there
the
other
indians
had
gained
on
us
while
i
was
engaged
in
shooting
at
their
leader
and
they
sent
several
shots
whizzing
past
me
but
fortunately
none
of
them
hit
the
intended
mark
to
return
their
compliment
i
occasionally
wheeled
myself
in
the
saddle
and
fired
back
at
them
and
one
of
my
shots
broke
the
leg
of
one
of
their
horses
which
left
its
rider
e
de
as
the
french
would
say
only
seven
or
eight
indians
now
remained
in
dangerous
proximity
to
me
and
as
their
horses
were
beginning
to
lag
somewhat
i
checked
my
faithful
old
steed
a
little
to
allow
him
an
opportunity
to
draw
an
extra
breath
or
two
i
had
determined
if
it
should
come
to
the
worst
to
drop
into
a
buffalo
wallow
where
i
could
stand
the
indians
off
for
a
while
but
i
was
not
compelled
to
do
this
as
brigham
carried
me
through
most
nobly
the
chase
was
kept
up
until
we
came
within
three
miles
of
the
end
of
the
railroad
track
where
two
companies
of
soldiers
were
stationed
for
the
purpose
of
protecting
the
workmen
from
the
indians
one
of
the
outposts
saw
the
indians
chasing
me
across
the
prairie
and
gave
the
alarm
in
a
few
minutes
i
saw
greatly
to
my
delight
men
coming
on
foot
and
cavalrymen
too
came
galloping
to
our
rescue
as
soon
as
they
could
mount
their
horses
when
the
indians
observed
this
they
turned
and
ran
in
the
direction
from
which
they
had
come
in
a
very
few
minutes
i
was
met
by
some
of
the
infantrymen
and
trackmen
and
jumping
to
the
ground
and
pulling
the
blanket
and
saddle
off
of
brigham
i
told
them
what
he
had
done
for
me
they
at
once
took
him
in
charge
led
him
around
and
rubbed
him
down
so
vigorously
that
i
thought
they
would
rub
him
to
death
captain
nolan
of
the
tenth
cavalry
now
came
up
with
forty
of
his
men
and
upon
learning
what
had
happened
he
determined
to
pursue
the
indians
he
kindly
offered
me
one
of
the
cavalry
horses
and
after
putting
my
own
saddle
and
bridle
on
the
animal
we
started
out
after
the
flying
indians
who
only
a
few
minutes
before
had
been
making
it
so
uncomfortably
lively
for
me
our
horses
were
all
fresh
and
of
excellent
stock
and
we
soon
began
shortening
the
distance
between
ourselves
and
the
redskins
before
they
had
gone
five
miles
we
overtook
and
killed
eight
of
their
number
the
others
succeeded
in
making
their
escape
on
coming
up
to
the
place
where
i
had
killed
the
first
horse
the
spotted
one
on
my
home
run
i
found
that
my
bullet
had
struck
him
in
the
forehead
and
killed
him
instantly
he
was
a
noble
animal
and
ought
to
have
been
engaged
in
better
business
when
we
got
back
to
camp
i
found
old
brigham
grazing
quietly
and
contentedly
on
the
grass
he
looked
up
at
me
as
if
to
ask
if
we
had
got
away
with
any
of
those
fellows
who
had
chased
us
i
believe
he
read
the
answer
in
my
eyes
another
very
exciting
hunting
adventure
of
mine
which
deserves
a
place
in
these
reminiscences
occurred
near
saline
river
my
companion
at
the
time
was
a
man
called
scotty
a
butcher
who
generally
accompanied
me
on
these
hunting
expeditions
to
cut
up
the
buffaloes
and
load
the
meat
into
a
light
wagon
which
he
brought
to
carry
it
in
he
was
a
brave
little
fellow
and
a
most
excellent
shot
i
had
killed
some
fifteen
buffaloes
and
we
had
started
for
home
with
a
of
meat
when
within
about
eight
miles
of
our
destination
we
suddenly
ran
on
to
a
party
of
at
least
thirty
indians
who
came
riding
out
of
the
head
of
a
ravine
on
this
occasion
i
was
mounted
on
a
most
excellent
horse
belonging
to
the
railroad
company
and
could
easily
have
made
my
escape
but
of
course
i
could
not
leave
scotty
who
was
driving
a
pair
of
mules
hitched
to
the
wagon
to
think
was
to
act
in
those
days
and
as
scotty
and
i
had
often
talked
over
a
plan
of
defense
in
case
we
were
ever
surprised
by
indians
we
instantly
proceeded
to
carry
it
out
we
jumped
to
the
ground
unhitched
the
mules
quicker
than
it
had
ever
been
done
before
and
tied
them
and
my
horse
to
the
wagon
we
threw
the
buffalo
hams
upon
the
ground
and
piled
them
around
the
wheels
in
such
a
shape
as
to
form
a
breastwork
all
this
was
done
in
a
shorter
time
than
it
takes
to
tell
it
and
then
with
our
extra
box
of
ammunition
and
three
or
four
extra
revolvers
which
we
always
carried
along
with
us
we
crept
under
the
wagon
and
were
fully
prepared
to
give
our
visitors
the
warmest
kind
of
a
reception
the
indians
came
on
but
when
they
were
within
one
hundred
yards
of
us
we
opened
such
a
sudden
and
galling
fire
upon
them
that
they
held
up
and
began
to
circle
around
the
wagon
instead
of
riding
up
to
take
tea
with
us
they
however
charged
back
and
forth
upon
us
several
times
and
their
shots
killed
the
two
mules
and
my
horse
but
we
gave
it
to
them
right
and
left
and
had
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
three
of
them
fall
to
the
ground
not
more
than
fifty
yards
away
on
seeing
how
well
we
were
fortified
and
protected
by
our
breastwork
of
hams
they
probably
came
to
the
conclusion
that
it
would
be
a
difficult
undertaking
to
dislodge
us
for
they
drew
off
and
gave
us
a
rest
but
only
a
short
one
this
was
the
kind
of
fighting
we
had
been
expecting
for
a
long
time
as
we
knew
that
sooner
or
later
we
would
be
jumped
by
indians
while
we
were
out
buffalo
hunting
i
had
an
understanding
with
the
officers
who
commanded
the
troops
at
the
end
of
the
track
that
in
case
their
pickets
should
at
any
time
notice
a
smoke
in
the
direction
of
our
hunting
ground
they
were
to
give
the
alarm
so
that
assistance
might
be
sent
to
us
for
the
smoke
was
to
indicate
that
we
were
in
danger
i
now
resolved
to
signal
to
the
troops
in
the
manner
agreed
on
and
at
the
first
opportunity
set
fire
to
the
grass
on
the
windward
side
of
the
wagon
the
fire
spread
over
the
prairie
at
a
rapid
rate
causing
a
dense
smoke
which
i
knew
would
be
seen
at
the
camp
the
indians
did
not
seem
to
understand
this
strategic
movement
they
got
off
from
their
horses
and
from
behind
a
bank
or
knoll
again
peppered
away
at
us
but
we
were
well
fortified
and
whenever
they
showed
their
heads
we
let
them
know
that
we
could
shoot
as
well
as
they
illustration
the
fire
signal
after
we
had
been
cooped
up
in
our
little
fort
for
about
an
hour
we
discovered
cavalry
coming
toward
us
at
full
gallop
over
the
prairie
our
signal
of
distress
had
proved
a
success
the
indians
saw
the
soldiers
at
about
the
same
time
that
we
did
and
thinking
that
it
would
not
be
healthy
for
them
to
remain
much
longer
in
that
vicinity
they
mounted
their
horses
and
disappeared
down
the
cañons
of
the
creek
when
the
soldiers
came
up
we
had
the
satisfaction
of
showing
them
five
indians
that
is
dead
ones
two
hours
later
we
pulled
into
camp
with
our
load
of
meat
which
was
found
to
be
all
right
except
that
it
had
a
few
bullets
and
arrows
sticking
in
it
while
i
was
hunting
for
the
kansas
pacific
railway
i
had
the
pleasure
in
the
fall
of
of
meeting
the
celebrated
kit
carson
one
of
if
not
the
oldest
and
most
noted
scout
guide
and
hunter
that
our
western
country
has
ever
produced
he
was
on
his
way
to
washington
i
also
met
him
on
his
return
from
the
east
and
invited
him
to
be
my
guest
for
a
few
days
at
hays
city
which
invitation
he
accepted
he
then
proceeded
to
fort
lyon
colorado
near
which
place
his
boggs
and
family
resided
at
this
time
his
health
was
failing
and
shortly
afterwards
he
died
at
boggs
residence

chapter
xv
champion
buffalo
killer
shortly
after
the
adventures
mentioned
in
the
preceding
chapter
i
had
my
celebrated
buffalo
hunt
with
billy
comstock
a
noted
scout
guide
and
interpreter
who
was
then
chief
of
scouts
at
fort
wallace
kansas
comstock
had
the
reputation
for
a
long
time
of
being
a
most
successful
buffalo
hunter
and
the
officers
in
particular
who
had
seen
him
kill
buffaloes
were
very
desirous
of
backing
him
in
a
match
against
me
it
was
accordingly
arranged
that
i
should
shoot
him
a
match
and
the
preliminaries
were
easily
and
satisfactorily
agreed
upon
we
were
to
hunt
one
day
of
eight
hours
beginning
at
eight
in
the
morning
and
closing
at
four
in
the
afternoon
the
wager
was
five
hundred
dollars
a
side
and
the
man
who
should
kill
the
greater
number
of
buffaloes
from
on
horseback
was
to
be
declared
the
winner
the
hunt
took
place
about
twenty
miles
east
of
sheridan
and
as
it
had
been
pretty
well
advertised
and
noised
abroad
a
large
crowd
witnessed
the
interesting
and
exciting
scene
an
excursion
party
mostly
from
louis
consisting
of
about
a
hundred
gentlemen
and
ladies
came
out
on
a
special
train
to
view
the
sport
and
among
the
number
was
my
wife
with
little
baby
arta
who
had
come
to
remain
with
me
for
a
while
the
buffaloes
were
quite
plenty
and
it
was
agreed
that
we
should
go
into
the
same
herd
at
the
same
time
and
make
a
run
as
we
called
it
each
one
killing
as
many
as
possible
a
referee
was
to
follow
each
of
us
on
horseback
when
we
entered
the
herd
and
count
the
buffaloes
killed
by
each
man
the
louis
excursionists
as
well
as
the
other
spectators
rode
out
to
the
vicinity
of
the
hunting
grounds
in
wagons
and
on
horseback
keeping
well
out
of
sight
of
the
buffaloes
so
as
not
to
frighten
them
until
the
time
came
for
us
to
dash
into
the
herd
when
they
were
to
come
up
as
near
as
they
pleased
and
witness
the
chase
we
were
fortunate
in
the
first
run
in
getting
good
ground
comstock
was
mounted
on
one
of
his
favorite
horses
while
i
rode
old
brigham
i
felt
confident
that
i
had
the
advantage
of
comstock
in
two
things
first
i
had
the
best
buffalo
horse
that
ever
made
a
track
and
second
i
was
using
what
was
known
at
that
time
as
the
a
springfield
rifle
calibre
it
was
my
favorite
old
lucretia
which
has
already
been
introduced
to
the
notice
of
the
reader
while
comstock
was
armed
with
a
henry
rifle
and
although
he
could
fire
a
few
shots
quicker
than
i
could
yet
i
was
pretty
certain
that
it
did
not
carry
powder
and
lead
enough
to
do
execution
equal
to
my
calibre
at
last
the
time
came
to
begin
the
match
comstock
and
i
dashed
into
a
herd
followed
by
the
referees
the
buffaloes
separated
comstock
took
the
left
bunch
and
i
the
right
my
great
in
killing
buffaloes
from
horseback
was
to
get
them
circling
by
riding
my
horse
at
the
head
of
the
herd
shooting
the
leaders
thus
crowding
their
followers
to
the
left
till
they
would
finally
circle
round
and
round
on
this
morning
the
buffaloes
were
very
accommodating
and
i
soon
had
them
running
in
a
beautiful
circle
when
i
dropped
them
thick
and
fast
until
i
had
killed
which
finished
my
run
comstock
began
shooting
at
the
rear
of
the
herd
which
he
was
chasing
and
they
kept
straight
on
he
succeeded
however
in
killing
but
they
were
scattered
over
a
distance
of
three
miles
while
mine
lay
close
together
i
had
nursed
my
buffaloes
as
a
does
the
balls
when
he
makes
a
big
run
after
the
result
of
the
first
run
had
been
duly
announced
our
louis
excursion
friends
who
had
approached
to
the
place
where
we
had
stopped
set
out
a
lot
of
champagne
which
they
had
brought
with
them
and
which
proved
a
good
drink
on
a
kansas
prairie
and
a
buffalo
hunter
was
a
good
man
to
get
away
with
it
while
taking
a
short
rest
we
suddenly
spied
another
herd
of
buffaloes
coming
toward
us
it
was
only
a
small
drove
and
we
at
once
prepared
to
give
the
animals
a
lively
reception
they
proved
to
be
a
herd
of
cows
and
calves
which
by
the
way
are
quicker
in
their
movements
than
the
bulls
we
charged
in
among
them
and
i
concluded
my
run
with
a
score
of
eighteen
while
comstock
killed
fourteen
the
score
now
stood
to
in
my
favor
again
the
excursion
party
approached
and
once
more
the
champagne
was
tapped
after
we
had
eaten
a
lunch
which
was
spread
for
us
we
resumed
the
hunt
striking
out
for
a
distance
of
three
miles
we
came
up
close
to
another
herd
as
i
was
so
far
ahead
of
my
competitor
in
the
number
killed
i
thought
i
could
afford
to
give
an
extra
exhibition
of
my
skill
i
had
told
the
ladies
that
i
would
on
the
next
run
ride
my
horse
without
saddle
or
bridle
this
had
raised
the
excitement
to
fever
heat
among
the
excursionists
and
i
remember
one
fair
lady
who
endeavored
to
prevail
upon
me
not
to
attempt
it
that
nothing
at
all
said
i
i
have
done
it
many
a
time
and
old
brigham
knows
as
well
as
i
what
i
am
doing
and
sometimes
a
great
deal
better
so
leaving
my
saddle
and
bridle
with
the
wagons
we
rode
to
the
windward
of
the
buffaloes
as
usual
and
when
within
a
few
hundred
yards
of
them
we
dashed
into
the
herd
i
soon
had
thirteen
laid
out
on
the
ground
the
last
one
of
which
i
had
driven
down
close
to
the
wagons
where
the
ladies
were
it
frightened
some
of
the
tender
creatures
to
see
the
buffalo
coming
at
full
speed
directly
toward
them
but
when
he
had
got
within
fifty
yards
of
one
of
the
wagons
i
shot
him
dead
in
his
tracks
this
made
my
buffalo
and
finished
my
third
and
last
run
comstock
having
killed
as
it
was
now
late
in
the
afternoon
comstock
and
his
backers
gave
up
the
idea
that
he
could
beat
me
and
thereupon
the
referees
declared
me
the
winner
of
the
match
as
well
as
the
champion
of
the
plains
a
footnote
a
poor
billy
comstock
was
afterwards
treacherously
murdered
by
the
indians
he
and
sharpe
grover
visited
a
village
of
indians
supposed
to
be
peaceably
inclined
near
big
spring
station
in
western
kansas
and
after
spending
several
hours
with
the
redskins
in
friendly
conversation
they
prepared
to
depart
having
declined
an
invitation
to
pass
the
night
there
it
appears
that
comstock
beautiful
revolver
had
attracted
the
attention
of
the
indians
who
overtook
him
and
his
companion
when
they
had
gone
about
half
a
mile
after
surrounding
the
two
men
they
suddenly
attacked
them
they
killed
scalped
and
robbed
comstock
but
grover
although
severely
wounded
made
his
escape
owing
to
the
fleetness
of
the
excellent
horse
which
he
was
riding
this
sad
event
occurred
august
on
our
way
back
to
camp
we
took
with
us
some
of
the
choice
meat
and
finest
heads
in
this
connection
it
will
not
be
out
of
place
to
state
that
during
the
time
i
was
hunting
for
the
kansas
pacific
i
always
brought
into
camp
the
best
buffalo
heads
and
turned
them
over
to
the
company
who
found
a
very
good
use
for
them
they
had
them
mounted
in
the
best
possible
manner
and
sent
them
to
all
the
principal
cities
and
railroad
centers
in
the
country
having
them
placed
in
prominent
positions
at
the
leading
hotels
dépôts
and
other
public
buildings
as
a
sort
of
or
advertisement
of
the
kansas
pacific
railroad
and
they
attract
the
attention
of
the
traveler
almost
everywhere
whenever
i
am
traveling
over
the
country
and
see
one
of
these
i
feel
pretty
certain
that
i
was
the
cause
of
the
death
of
the
old
fellow
whose
body
it
once
ornamented
and
many
a
wild
and
exciting
hunt
is
thus
called
to
mind
the
end
of
the
track
finally
reached
sheridan
in
the
month
of
may
and
as
the
road
was
not
to
be
built
any
farther
just
then
my
services
as
a
hunter
were
not
any
longer
required
at
this
time
there
was
a
general
indian
war
raging
all
along
the
western
borders
general
sheridan
had
taken
up
his
headquarters
at
fort
hayes
in
order
to
be
in
the
field
to
superintend
the
campaign
in
person
as
scouts
and
guides
were
in
great
demand
i
concluded
once
more
to
take
up
my
old
avocation
of
scouting
and
guiding
for
the
army
having
no
suitable
place
in
which
to
leave
my
old
and
faithful
brigham
and
not
wishing
to
kill
him
by
scouting
i
determined
to
dispose
of
him
i
was
very
reluctant
to
part
with
him
but
i
consoled
myself
with
the
thought
that
he
would
not
be
likely
to
receive
harder
usage
in
other
hands
than
he
had
in
mine
i
had
several
good
offers
to
sell
him
but
at
the
suggestion
of
some
gentlemen
in
sheridan
all
of
whom
were
anxious
to
obtain
possession
of
the
horse
i
put
him
up
at
a
raffle
in
order
to
give
them
all
an
equal
chance
of
becoming
the
owner
of
the
famous
steed
there
were
ten
chances
at
thirty
dollars
each
and
they
were
all
quickly
taken
old
brigham
was
won
by
a
gentleman
ike
bonham
who
took
him
to
wyandotte
kansas
where
he
soon
added
new
laurels
to
his
already
brilliant
record
although
i
am
getting
ahead
of
my
story
i
must
now
follow
brigham
for
a
while
a
grand
tournament
came
off
four
miles
from
wyandotte
and
brigham
took
part
in
it
as
has
already
been
stated
his
appearance
was
not
very
prepossessing
and
nobody
suspected
him
of
being
anything
but
the
most
ordinary
kind
of
a
plug
the
friends
of
the
rider
laughed
at
him
for
being
mounted
on
such
a
steed
when
the
exercises
which
were
of
a
very
tame
character
being
more
for
style
than
speed
were
over
and
just
as
the
crowd
were
about
to
return
to
the
city
a
purse
of
was
made
up
to
be
given
to
the
horse
that
could
first
reach
wyandotte
four
miles
distant
the
arrangement
was
carried
out
and
brigham
was
entered
as
one
of
the
contestants
for
the
purse
everybody
laughed
at
bonham
when
it
became
known
that
he
was
to
ride
that
plug
against
the
five
thoroughbreds
which
were
to
take
part
in
the
race
when
all
the
preliminaries
had
been
arranged
the
signal
was
given
and
off
went
the
horses
for
wyandotte
for
the
first
several
of
the
horses
led
brigham
but
on
the
second
mile
he
began
passing
them
one
after
the
other
and
on
the
third
mile
he
was
in
advance
of
them
all
and
was
showing
them
all
the
road
at
a
lively
rate
on
the
fourth
mile
his
rider
let
him
out
and
arrived
at
the
hotel
the
in
wyandotte
a
long
way
ahead
of
his
fastest
competitor
everybody
was
surprised
as
well
as
disgusted
that
such
a
homely
critter
should
be
the
winner
brigham
of
course
had
already
acquired
a
wide
reputation
and
his
name
and
exploits
had
often
appeared
in
the
newspapers
and
when
it
was
learned
that
this
critter
was
none
other
than
the
identical
brigham
nearly
the
whole
crowd
admitted
that
they
had
heard
of
him
before
and
had
they
known
him
in
the
first
place
they
certainly
would
have
ruled
him
out
i
finally
lost
track
of
brigham
and
for
several
years
i
did
not
know
what
had
become
of
him
three
years
ago
while
i
was
at
memphis
tennessee
i
met
a
wilcox
who
had
been
one
of
the
superintendents
of
construction
of
the
kansas
pacific
railroad
and
he
informed
me
that
he
owned
brigham
and
that
he
was
at
that
time
on
his
farm
only
a
few
miles
out
of
town
the
next
day
i
rode
out
with
wilcox
and
took
a
look
at
the
gallant
old
horse
he
was
comfortably
cared
for
in
stable
and
looked
the
same
clever
pony
that
he
always
was
it
seemed
as
if
he
almost
remembered
me
and
i
put
my
arms
around
his
neck
as
though
he
had
been
a
child
wilcox
bought
the
horse
at
wyandotte
from
the
gentleman
who
had
won
him
at
the
raffle
and
he
intends
to
keep
him
as
long
as
he
lives
i
am
grateful
that
he
is
in
such
good
hands
and
whenever
i
again
visit
memphis
i
shall
surely
go
and
see
brigham
if
he
is
still
alive
but
to
return
to
the
thread
of
my
narrative
from
which
i
have
wandered
having
received
the
appointment
of
guide
and
scout
and
having
been
ordered
to
report
at
fort
larned
then
commanded
by
captain
dangerfield
parker
i
saw
it
was
necessary
to
take
my
family
who
had
remained
with
me
at
sheridan
after
the
match
to
leavenworth
and
there
leave
them
this
i
did
at
once
and
after
providing
them
with
a
comfortable
little
home
i
returned
and
reported
for
duty
at
fort
larned
chapter
xvi
a
courier
the
scouts
at
fort
larned
when
i
arrived
there
were
commanded
by
dick
curtis
an
old
guide
frontiersman
and
indian
interpreter
there
were
some
three
hundred
lodges
of
kiowa
and
comanche
indians
camped
near
the
fort
these
indians
had
not
as
yet
gone
upon
the
but
were
restless
and
discontented
and
their
leading
chiefs
satanta
lone
wolf
kicking
bird
satank
sittamore
and
other
noted
warriors
were
rather
saucy
the
post
at
the
time
was
garrisoned
by
only
two
companies
of
infantry
and
one
of
cavalry
general
hazen
who
was
at
the
post
was
endeavoring
to
pacify
the
indians
and
keep
them
from
going
on
the
i
was
appointed
as
his
special
scout
and
one
morning
he
notified
me
that
he
was
going
to
fort
harker
and
wished
me
to
accompany
him
as
far
as
fort
zarah
thirty
miles
distant
the
general
usually
traveled
in
an
ambulance
but
this
trip
he
was
to
make
in
a
wagon
under
the
escort
of
a
squad
of
twenty
infantrymen
so
early
one
morning
in
august
we
started
arriving
safely
at
fort
zarah
at
twelve
general
hazen
thought
it
unnecessary
that
we
should
go
farther
and
he
proceeded
on
his
way
to
fort
harker
without
an
escort
leaving
instructions
that
we
should
return
to
fort
larned
the
next
day
after
the
general
had
gone
i
went
to
the
sergeant
in
command
of
the
squad
and
told
him
that
i
was
going
back
that
very
afternoon
instead
of
waiting
till
the
next
morning
and
i
accordingly
saddled
up
my
mule
and
set
out
for
fort
larned
i
proceeded
uninterruptedly
until
i
got
about
between
the
two
posts
when
at
pawnee
rock
i
was
suddenly
jumped
by
about
forty
indians
who
came
dashing
up
to
me
extending
their
hands
and
saying
how
how
they
were
some
of
the
same
indians
who
had
been
hanging
around
fort
larned
in
the
morning
i
saw
that
they
had
on
their
and
were
evidently
now
out
on
the
illustration
a
big
joke
my
first
impulse
was
to
shake
hands
with
them
as
they
seemed
so
desirous
of
it
i
accordingly
reached
out
my
hand
to
one
of
them
who
grasped
it
with
a
tight
grip
and
jerked
me
violently
forward
another
pulled
my
mule
by
the
bridle
and
in
a
moment
i
was
completely
surrounded
before
i
could
do
anything
at
all
they
had
seized
my
revolvers
from
the
holsters
and
i
received
a
blow
on
the
head
from
a
tomahawk
which
nearly
rendered
me
senseless
my
gun
which
was
lying
across
the
saddle
was
snatched
from
its
place
and
finally
the
indian
who
had
hold
of
the
bridle
started
off
towards
the
arkansas
river
leading
the
mule
which
was
being
lashed
by
the
other
indians
who
were
following
the
savages
were
all
singing
yelling
and
whooping
as
only
indians
can
do
when
they
are
having
their
little
game
all
their
own
way
while
looking
towards
the
river
i
saw
on
the
opposite
side
an
immense
village
moving
down
along
the
bank
and
then
i
became
convinced
that
the
indians
had
left
the
post
and
were
now
starting
out
on
the
my
captors
crossed
the
stream
with
me
and
as
we
waded
through
the
shallow
water
they
continued
to
lash
the
mule
and
myself
finally
they
brought
me
before
an
important
looking
body
of
indians
who
proved
to
be
the
chiefs
and
principal
warriors
i
soon
recognized
old
satanta
among
them
as
well
as
others
whom
i
knew
and
i
supposed
it
was
all
over
with
me
the
indians
were
jabbering
away
so
rapidly
among
themselves
that
i
could
not
understand
what
they
were
saying
satanta
at
last
asked
me
where
i
had
been
and
as
good
luck
would
have
it
a
happy
thought
struck
me
i
told
him
i
had
been
after
a
herd
of
cattle
or
as
they
called
them
it
so
happened
that
the
indians
had
been
out
of
meat
for
several
weeks
as
the
large
herd
of
cattle
which
had
been
promised
them
had
not
yet
arrived
although
expected
by
them
the
moment
that
i
mentioned
that
i
had
been
searching
for
the
old
satanta
began
questioning
me
in
a
very
eager
manner
he
asked
me
where
the
cattle
were
and
i
replied
that
they
were
back
only
a
few
miles
and
that
i
had
been
sent
by
general
hazen
to
inform
him
that
the
cattle
were
coming
and
that
they
were
intended
for
his
people
this
seemed
to
please
the
old
rascal
who
also
wanted
to
know
if
there
were
any
soldiers
with
the
herd
and
my
reply
was
that
there
were
thereupon
the
chiefs
held
a
consultation
and
presently
satanta
asked
me
if
general
hazen
had
really
said
that
they
should
have
the
cattle
i
replied
in
the
affirmative
and
added
that
i
had
been
directed
to
bring
the
cattle
to
them
i
followed
this
up
with
a
very
dignified
inquiry
asking
why
his
young
men
had
treated
me
so
the
old
wretch
intimated
that
it
was
only
a
freak
of
the
boys
that
the
young
men
had
wanted
to
see
if
i
was
brave
in
fact
they
had
only
meant
to
test
my
bravery
and
that
the
whole
thing
was
a
joke
the
veteran
liar
was
now
beating
me
at
my
own
game
of
lying
but
i
was
very
glad
of
it
as
it
was
in
my
favor
i
did
not
let
him
suspect
that
i
doubted
his
veracity
but
i
remarked
that
it
was
a
rough
way
to
treat
friends
he
immediately
ordered
his
young
men
to
give
me
back
my
arms
and
scolded
them
for
what
they
had
done
of
course
the
sly
old
dog
was
now
playing
it
very
fine
as
he
was
anxious
to
get
possession
of
the
cattle
with
which
he
believed
there
was
a
heap
of
soldiers
coming
he
had
concluded
it
was
not
best
to
fight
the
soldiers
if
he
could
get
the
cattle
peaceably
another
council
was
held
by
the
chiefs
and
in
a
few
minutes
old
satanta
came
and
asked
me
if
i
would
go
over
and
bring
the
cattle
down
to
the
opposite
side
of
the
river
so
that
they
could
get
them
i
replied
of
course
that
my
instruction
from
general
hazen
satanta
said
i
must
not
feel
angry
at
his
young
men
for
they
had
only
been
acting
in
fun
he
then
inquired
if
i
wished
any
of
his
men
to
accompany
me
to
the
cattle
herd
i
replied
that
it
would
be
better
for
me
to
go
alone
and
then
the
soldiers
could
keep
right
on
to
fort
larned
while
i
could
drive
the
herd
down
on
the
bottom
so
wheeling
my
mule
around
i
was
soon
the
river
leaving
old
satanta
in
the
firm
belief
that
i
had
told
him
a
straight
story
and
was
going
for
the
cattle
which
only
existed
in
my
imagination
i
hardly
knew
what
to
do
but
thought
that
if
i
could
get
the
river
between
the
indians
and
myself
i
would
have
a
good
of
a
mile
the
start
of
them
and
could
then
make
a
run
for
fort
larned
as
my
mule
was
a
good
one
thus
far
my
cattle
story
had
panned
out
all
right
but
just
as
i
reached
the
opposite
bank
of
the
river
i
looked
behind
and
saw
that
ten
or
fifteen
indians
who
had
begun
to
suspect
something
crooked
were
following
me
the
moment
that
my
mule
secured
a
good
foothold
on
the
bank
i
urged
him
into
a
gentle
lope
towards
the
place
where
according
to
my
statement
the
cattle
were
to
be
brought
upon
reaching
a
little
ridge
and
riding
down
the
other
side
out
of
view
i
turned
my
mule
and
headed
him
westward
for
fort
larned
i
let
him
out
for
all
that
he
was
worth
and
when
i
came
out
on
a
little
rise
of
ground
i
looked
back
and
saw
the
indian
village
in
plain
sight
my
pursuers
were
now
on
the
ridge
which
i
had
passed
over
and
were
looking
for
me
in
every
direction
presently
they
spied
me
and
seeing
that
i
was
running
away
they
struck
out
in
swift
pursuit
and
in
a
few
minutes
it
became
painfully
evident
that
they
were
gaining
on
me
they
kept
up
the
chase
as
far
as
ash
creek
six
miles
from
fort
larned
i
still
led
them
half
a
mile
as
their
horses
had
not
gained
much
during
the
last
half
of
the
race
my
mule
seemed
to
have
gotten
his
second
wind
and
as
i
was
on
the
old
road
i
had
played
the
whip
and
spurs
on
him
without
much
cessation
the
indians
likewise
had
urged
their
steeds
to
the
utmost
finally
upon
reaching
the
dividing
ridge
between
ash
greek
and
pawnee
fork
i
saw
fort
larned
only
four
miles
away
it
was
now
sundown
and
i
heard
the
evening
gun
at
the
fort
the
troops
of
the
garrison
little
dreamed
that
there
was
a
man
flying
for
his
life
from
the
indians
and
trying
to
reach
the
post
the
indians
were
once
more
gaining
on
me
and
when
i
crossed
the
pawnee
fork
two
miles
from
the
post
two
or
three
of
them
were
only
a
quarter
of
a
mile
behind
me
just
as
i
had
gained
the
opposite
bank
of
the
stream
i
was
overjoyed
to
see
some
soldiers
in
a
government
wagon
only
a
short
distance
off
i
yelled
at
the
top
of
my
voice
and
riding
up
to
them
told
them
that
the
indians
were
after
me
illustration
ambushing
the
indians
denver
jim
a
scout
asked
how
many
there
were
and
upon
my
informing
him
that
there
were
about
a
dozen
he
said
let
drive
the
wagon
into
the
trees
and
we
lay
for
the
team
was
hurriedly
driven
in
among
the
trees
and
low
bushes
and
there
secreted
we
did
not
have
to
wait
long
for
the
indians
who
came
dashing
up
lashing
their
horses
which
were
panting
and
blowing
we
let
two
of
them
pass
by
but
we
opened
a
lively
fire
on
the
next
three
or
four
killing
two
at
the
first
crack
the
others
following
discovered
that
they
had
run
into
an
ambush
and
whirling
off
into
the
brush
they
turned
and
ran
back
in
the
direction
whence
they
had
come
the
two
who
had
passed
heard
the
firing
and
made
their
escape
we
scalped
the
two
that
we
had
killed
and
appropriated
their
arms
and
equipments
and
then
catching
their
horses
we
made
our
way
into
the
post
the
soldiers
had
heard
us
firing
and
as
we
were
approaching
the
fort
the
drums
were
being
beaten
and
the
buglers
were
sounding
the
call
to
fall
in
the
officers
had
thought
that
satanta
and
his
indians
were
coming
in
to
capture
the
fort
it
seems
that
on
the
morning
of
that
day
two
hours
after
general
hazen
had
taken
his
departure
old
satanta
drove
into
the
post
in
an
ambulance
which
he
had
received
some
months
before
as
a
present
from
the
government
he
appeared
to
be
angry
and
bent
on
mischief
in
an
interview
with
captain
parker
the
commanding
officer
he
asked
why
general
hazen
had
left
the
post
without
supplying
the
beef
cattle
which
had
been
promised
to
him
the
captain
told
him
that
the
cattle
were
surely
on
the
road
but
he
could
not
explain
why
they
were
detained
the
interview
proved
to
be
a
stormy
one
and
satanta
made
numerous
threats
saying
that
if
he
wished
he
could
capture
the
whole
post
with
his
warriors
captain
parker
who
was
a
brave
man
gave
satanta
to
understand
that
he
was
reckoning
beyond
his
powers
and
would
find
it
a
more
difficult
undertaking
than
he
had
any
idea
of
as
they
were
prepared
for
him
at
any
moment
the
interview
finally
terminated
and
satanta
angrily
left
the
officers
presence
going
over
to
the
sutler
store
he
sold
his
ambulance
to
tappan
the
past
trader
and
with
a
portion
of
the
proceeds
he
secretly
managed
to
secure
some
whisky
from
some
bad
men
around
the
fort
there
are
always
to
be
found
around
every
frontier
post
some
men
who
will
sell
whisky
to
the
indians
at
any
time
and
under
any
circumstances
notwithstanding
it
is
a
flagrant
violation
of
both
civil
and
military
regulations
satanta
mounted
his
horse
and
taking
the
whisky
with
him
he
rode
rapidly
away
and
proceeded
straight
to
his
village
he
had
not
been
gone
over
an
hour
when
he
returned
to
the
vicinity
of
the
post
accompanied
by
his
warriors
who
came
in
from
every
direction
to
the
number
of
seven
or
eight
hundred
it
was
evident
that
the
irate
old
rascal
was
on
his
ear
so
to
speak
and
it
looked
as
if
he
intended
to
carry
out
his
threat
of
capturing
the
fort
the
garrison
at
once
turned
out
and
prepared
to
receive
the
who
when
within
half
a
mile
circled
around
the
fort
and
fired
numerous
shots
into
it
instead
of
trying
to
take
it
by
assault
while
this
circular
movement
was
going
on
it
was
observed
that
the
indian
village
in
the
distance
was
packing
up
preparatory
to
leaving
and
it
was
soon
under
way
the
mounted
warriors
remained
behind
some
little
time
to
give
their
families
an
opportunity
to
get
away
as
they
feared
that
the
troops
might
possibly
in
some
manner
intercept
them
finally
they
encircled
the
post
several
times
fired
some
farewell
rounds
and
then
galloped
away
over
the
prairie
to
overtake
their
fast
departing
village
on
their
way
thither
they
surprised
and
killed
a
party
of
down
on
the
pawnee
fork
as
well
as
some
herders
who
were
guarding
beef
cattle
some
seven
or
eight
men
in
all
were
killed
and
it
was
evident
that
the
indians
meant
business
the
soldiers
with
the
wagon
whom
i
had
met
at
the
crossing
of
the
pawnee
fork
had
been
out
for
the
bodies
of
the
men
under
the
circumstances
it
was
no
wonder
that
the
garrison
upon
hearing
the
reports
of
our
guns
when
we
fired
upon
the
party
whom
we
ambushed
should
have
thought
the
indians
were
coming
back
to
give
them
another
turn
we
found
that
all
was
excitement
at
the
post
double
guards
had
been
put
on
duty
and
captain
parker
had
all
the
scouts
at
his
headquarters
he
was
endeavoring
to
get
some
one
to
take
some
important
dispatches
to
general
sheridan
at
fort
hays
i
reported
to
him
at
once
and
stated
where
i
had
met
the
indians
and
how
i
had
escaped
from
them
you
was
very
fortunate
cody
in
thinking
of
that
cattle
story
but
for
that
little
game
your
hair
would
now
be
an
ornament
to
a
lodge
said
he
just
then
dick
curtis
spoke
up
and
said
cody
the
captain
is
anxious
to
send
some
dispatches
to
general
sheridan
at
fort
hays
and
none
of
the
scouts
here
seem
to
be
very
willing
to
undertake
the
trip
they
say
they
are
not
well
enough
acquainted
with
the
country
to
find
the
way
at
night
as
a
storm
was
coming
up
it
was
quite
dark
and
the
scouts
feared
that
they
would
lose
the
way
besides
it
was
a
dangerous
ride
as
a
large
party
of
indians
were
known
to
be
camped
on
walnut
creek
on
the
direct
road
to
fort
hays
it
was
evident
that
curtis
was
trying
to
induce
me
to
volunteer
i
made
some
evasive
answer
to
curtis
for
i
did
not
care
to
volunteer
after
my
long
day
ride
but
curtis
did
not
let
the
matter
drop
said
he
i
wish
bill
that
you
were
not
so
tired
by
your
chase
of
for
you
know
the
country
better
than
the
rest
of
the
boys
and
i
am
certain
that
you
could
go
through
as
far
as
the
ride
to
fort
hays
is
concerned
that
alone
would
matter
but
little
to
me
i
said
but
it
is
a
risky
piece
of
work
just
now
as
the
country
is
full
of
hostile
indians
still
if
no
other
scout
is
willing
to
volunteer
i
will
chance
it
i
go
provided
i
am
furnished
with
a
good
horse
i
am
tired
of
being
chased
on
a
government
mule
by
indians
at
this
captain
nolan
who
had
been
listening
to
our
conversation
said
bill
you
may
have
the
best
horse
in
my
company
you
can
take
your
choice
if
you
will
carry
these
dispatches
although
it
is
against
regulations
to
dismount
an
enlisted
man
i
have
no
hesitancy
in
such
a
case
of
urgent
necessity
as
this
is
in
telling
you
that
you
may
have
any
horse
you
may
wish
captain
your
first
sergeant
has
a
splendid
horse
and
that
the
one
i
want
if
he
let
me
ride
that
horse
i
be
ready
to
start
in
one
hour
storm
or
no
storm
said
i
good
enough
bill
you
shall
have
the
horse
but
are
you
sure
you
can
find
your
way
on
such
a
dark
night
as
this
i
have
hunted
on
nearly
every
acre
of
ground
between
here
and
fort
hays
and
i
can
almost
keep
my
route
by
the
bones
of
the
dead
buffaloes
i
confidently
replied
never
fear
captain
about
cody
not
finding
the
way
he
is
as
good
in
the
dark
as
he
is
in
the
daylight
said
curtis
an
orderly
was
sent
for
the
horse
and
the
animal
was
soon
brought
up
although
the
sergeant
kicked
a
little
against
letting
him
go
after
eating
a
lunch
and
filling
a
canteen
with
brandy
i
went
to
headquarters
and
put
my
own
saddle
and
bridle
on
the
horse
i
was
to
ride
i
then
got
the
dispatches
and
by
ten
was
on
the
road
to
fort
hays
which
was
miles
distant
across
the
country
the
scouts
had
all
bidden
me
a
hearty
and
wished
me
success
not
knowing
when
if
ever
they
would
again
gaze
upon
my
warlike
form
as
the
poet
would
say
it
was
dark
as
pitch
but
this
i
rather
liked
as
there
was
little
probability
of
any
of
the
seeing
me
unless
i
stumbled
upon
them
accidentally
my
greatest
danger
was
that
my
horse
might
run
into
a
hole
and
fall
down
and
in
this
way
get
away
from
me
to
avoid
any
such
accident
i
tied
one
end
of
my
rawhide
lariat
to
the
bridle
and
the
other
end
to
my
belt
i
did
propose
to
be
left
on
foot
alone
out
on
the
prairie
illustration
whoa
there
it
was
indeed
a
wise
precaution
that
i
had
taken
for
within
the
next
three
miles
the
horse
sure
enough
stepped
into
a
hole
and
down
he
went
throwing
me
clear
over
his
head
springing
to
his
feet
before
i
could
catch
hold
of
the
bridle
he
galloped
away
into
the
darkness
but
when
he
reached
the
full
length
of
the
lariat
he
found
that
he
was
picketed
to
bison
william
i
brought
him
up
standing
and
after
finding
my
gun
which
had
dropped
to
the
ground
i
went
up
to
him
and
in
a
moment
was
in
the
saddle
again
and
went
on
my
way
rejoicing
keeping
straight
on
my
course
until
i
came
to
the
ravines
leading
into
walnut
creek
miles
from
fort
larned
where
the
country
became
rougher
requiring
me
to
travel
slower
and
more
carefully
as
i
feared
the
horse
might
fall
over
the
bank
it
being
difficult
to
see
anything
five
feet
ahead
as
a
good
horse
is
not
very
apt
to
jump
over
a
bank
if
left
to
guide
himself
i
let
mine
pick
his
own
way
i
was
now
proceeding
as
quietly
as
possible
for
i
was
in
the
vicinity
of
a
band
of
indians
who
had
recently
camped
in
that
locality
i
thought
that
i
had
passed
somewhat
above
the
spot
having
made
a
little
circuit
to
the
west
with
that
intention
but
as
bad
luck
would
have
it
this
time
when
i
came
up
near
the
creek
i
suddenly
rode
in
among
a
herd
of
horses
the
animals
became
frightened
and
ran
off
in
every
direction
i
knew
at
once
that
i
was
among
indian
horses
and
had
walked
into
the
wrong
pew
so
without
waiting
to
apologize
i
backed
out
as
quickly
as
possible
at
this
moment
a
dog
not
fifty
yards
away
set
up
a
howl
and
then
i
heard
some
indians
engaged
in
conversation
they
were
guarding
the
horses
and
had
been
sleeping
hearing
my
horse
retreating
footsteps
toward
the
hills
and
thus
becoming
aware
that
there
had
been
an
enemy
in
their
camp
they
mounted
their
steeds
and
started
for
me
i
urged
my
horse
to
his
full
speed
taking
the
chances
of
his
falling
into
holes
and
guided
him
up
the
creek
bottom
the
indians
followed
me
as
fast
as
they
could
by
the
noise
i
made
but
i
soon
distanced
them
and
then
crossed
the
creek
when
i
had
traveled
several
miles
in
a
straight
course
as
i
supposed
i
took
out
my
compass
and
by
the
light
of
a
match
saw
that
i
was
bearing
two
points
to
the
east
of
north
at
once
changing
my
course
to
the
direct
route
i
pushed
rapidly
on
through
the
darkness
towards
smoky
hill
river
at
about
three
in
the
morning
i
began
traveling
more
cautiously
as
i
was
afraid
of
running
into
another
band
of
indians
occasionally
i
scared
up
a
herd
of
buffaloes
or
antelopes
or
coyotes
or
deer
which
would
frighten
my
horse
for
a
moment
but
with
the
exception
of
these
slight
alarms
i
got
along
all
right
after
crossing
smoky
hill
river
i
felt
comparatively
safe
as
this
was
the
last
stream
i
had
to
cross
riding
on
to
the
northward
i
struck
the
old
santa
fe
trail
ten
miles
from
fort
hays
just
at
break
of
day
my
horse
did
not
seem
much
fatigued
and
being
anxious
to
make
good
time
and
get
as
near
the
post
as
possible
before
it
was
fairly
daylight
as
there
might
be
bands
of
indians
camped
along
big
creek
i
urged
him
forward
as
fast
as
he
could
go
as
i
had
not
lost
any
indians
i
was
not
now
anxious
to
make
their
acquaintance
and
shortly
after
rode
into
the
post
i
proceeded
directly
to
general
headquarters
and
was
met
at
the
door
by
colonel
moore
on
general
sheridan
staff
who
asked
me
on
what
business
i
had
come
i
have
dispatches
for
general
sheridan
and
my
instructions
from
captain
parker
commanding
fort
larned
are
that
they
shall
be
delivered
to
the
general
as
soon
as
possible
said
i
colonel
moore
invited
me
into
one
of
the
offices
and
said
he
would
hand
the
dispatches
to
t
h
e
general
as
soon
as
he
got
up
illustration
delivering
dispatches
to
sheridan
i
prefer
to
give
these
dispatches
to
general
sheridan
myself
and
at
once
was
my
reply
the
general
who
was
sleeping
in
the
same
building
hearing
our
voices
called
out
send
the
man
in
with
the
dispatches
i
was
ushered
into
the
general
presence
and
as
we
had
met
before
he
recognized
me
and
said
hello
cody
is
that
you
yes
sir
i
have
some
dispatches
here
for
you
from
captain
parker
said
i
as
i
handed
the
package
over
to
him
he
hurriedly
read
them
and
said
they
were
important
and
then
he
asked
me
all
about
general
hazen
and
where
he
had
gone
and
about
the
breaking
out
of
the
kiowas
and
comanches
i
gave
him
all
the
information
that
i
possessed
and
related
the
events
and
adventures
of
the
previous
day
and
night
bill
said
he
you
must
have
had
a
pretty
lively
ride
you
certainly
had
a
close
call
when
you
ran
into
the
indians
on
walnut
creek
that
was
a
good
joke
that
you
played
on
old
satanta
i
suppose
you
pretty
tired
after
your
long
journey
i
am
rather
weary
general
that
a
fact
as
i
have
been
in
the
saddle
since
yesterday
morning
was
my
reply
but
my
horse
is
more
tired
than
i
am
and
needs
attention
full
as
much
if
not
more
i
added
thereupon
the
general
called
an
orderly
and
gave
instructions
to
have
my
animal
well
taken
care
of
and
then
he
said
cody
come
in
and
have
some
breakfast
with
me
no
thank
you
general
said
i
hays
city
is
only
a
mile
from
here
and
i
prefer
riding
over
there
as
i
know
about
every
one
in
the
town
and
want
to
see
some
of
my
friends
very
well
do
as
you
please
and
come
to
the
post
afterwards
as
i
want
to
see
you
said
he
bidding
him
and
telling
him
that
i
would
return
in
a
few
hours
i
rode
over
to
hays
city
and
at
the
perry
house
i
met
many
of
my
old
friends
who
were
of
course
all
glad
to
see
me
i
took
some
refreshments
and
a
two
hours
nap
and
afterward
returned
to
fort
hays
as
i
was
requested
as
i
rode
up
to
the
headquarters
i
noticed
several
scouts
in
a
little
group
evidently
engaged
in
conversation
on
some
important
matter
upon
inquiry
i
learned
that
general
sheridan
had
informed
them
that
he
was
desirous
of
sending
a
dispatch
to
fort
dodge
a
distance
of
miles
the
indians
had
recently
killed
two
or
three
men
while
they
were
carrying
dispatches
between
fort
hays
and
fort
dodge
and
on
this
account
none
of
the
scouts
seemed
at
all
anxious
to
volunteer
although
a
reward
of
several
hundred
dollars
was
offered
to
any
one
who
would
carry
the
dispatches
they
had
learned
of
my
experiences
of
the
previous
day
and
asked
me
if
i
did
not
think
it
would
be
a
dangerous
trip
i
gave
it
as
my
opinion
that
a
man
might
possibly
go
through
without
seeing
an
indian
but
that
the
chances
were
ten
to
one
that
he
would
have
an
exceedingly
lively
run
and
a
hard
time
before
he
reached
his
destination
if
he
ever
got
there
at
all
leaving
the
scouts
to
decide
among
themselves
as
to
who
was
to
go
i
reported
to
general
sheridan
who
also
informed
me
that
he
wished
some
one
to
carry
dispatches
to
fort
dodge
while
we
were
talking
his
chief
of
scouts
dick
parr
entered
and
stated
that
none
of
the
scouts
had
yet
volunteered
upon
hearing
this
i
got
my
brave
up
a
little
and
said
general
if
there
is
no
one
ready
to
volunteer
i
carry
your
dispatches
myself
i
had
not
thought
of
asking
you
to
do
this
duty
cody
as
you
are
already
pretty
hard
worked
but
it
is
really
important
that
these
dispatches
should
go
through
said
the
general
well
if
you
do
get
a
courier
by
four
this
afternoon
i
be
ready
for
business
at
that
time
all
i
want
is
a
fresh
horse
said
i
meantime
i
take
a
little
more
rest
it
was
not
much
of
a
rest
however
that
i
got
for
i
went
over
to
hays
city
again
and
had
a
time
with
the
boys
i
came
back
to
the
post
at
the
appointed
hour
and
finding
that
no
one
had
volunteered
i
reported
to
general
sheridan
he
had
selected
an
excellent
horse
for
me
and
on
handing
me
the
dispatches
he
said
you
can
start
as
soon
as
you
wish
the
sooner
the
better
and
good
luck
go
with
you
my
boy
in
about
an
hour
afterwards
i
was
on
the
road
and
just
before
dark
i
crossed
smoky
hill
river
i
had
not
yet
urged
my
horse
much
as
i
was
saving
his
strength
for
the
latter
end
of
the
route
and
for
any
run
that
i
might
have
to
make
in
case
the
should
jump
me
so
far
i
had
not
seen
a
sign
of
indians
and
as
evening
came
on
i
felt
comparatively
safe
i
had
no
adventures
worth
relating
during
the
night
and
just
before
daylight
i
found
myself
approaching
crossing
on
the
pawnee
fork
having
then
ridden
about
seventy
miles
a
company
of
colored
cavalry
commanded
by
major
cox
was
stationed
at
this
point
and
i
approached
their
camp
cautiously
for
fear
that
the
pickets
might
fire
upon
me
as
the
darkey
soldiers
were
liable
to
shoot
first
and
cry
halt
afterwards
when
within
hearing
distance
i
yelled
out
at
the
top
of
my
voice
and
was
answered
by
one
of
the
pickets
i
told
him
not
to
shoot
as
i
was
a
scout
from
fort
hays
and
then
calling
the
sergeant
of
the
guard
i
went
up
to
the
vidette
of
the
post
who
readily
recognized
me
i
entered
the
camp
and
proceeded
to
the
tent
of
major
cox
to
whom
i
handed
a
letter
from
general
sheridan
requesting
him
to
give
me
a
fresh
horse
he
at
once
complied
with
the
request
after
i
had
slept
an
hour
and
had
eaten
a
lunch
i
again
jumped
into
the
saddle
and
before
sunrise
i
was
once
more
on
the
road
it
was
miles
to
fort
dodge
and
i
arrived
there
between
nine
and
ten
without
having
seen
a
single
indian
after
delivering
the
dispatches
to
the
commanding
officer
i
met
johnny
austin
chief
of
scouts
at
this
post
who
was
an
old
friend
of
mine
upon
his
invitation
i
took
a
nap
at
his
house
and
when
i
awoke
fresh
for
business
once
more
he
informed
me
that
the
indians
had
been
all
around
the
post
for
the
past
two
or
three
days
running
off
cattle
and
horses
and
occasionally
killing
a
stray
man
it
was
a
wonder
to
him
that
i
had
met
with
none
of
the
on
the
way
there
the
indians
he
said
were
also
very
thick
on
the
arkansas
river
between
fort
dodge
and
fort
larned
and
making
considerable
trouble
fort
dodge
was
located
miles
west
of
fort
larned
the
latter
post
being
on
the
pawnee
fork
about
five
miles
from
its
junction
with
the
arkansas
river
the
commanding
officer
at
fort
dodge
was
anxious
to
send
some
dispatches
to
fort
larned
but
the
scouts
like
those
at
fort
hays
were
rather
backward
about
volunteering
as
it
was
considered
a
very
dangerous
undertaking
to
make
the
trip
as
fort
larned
was
my
post
and
as
i
wanted
to
go
there
anyhow
i
said
to
austin
that
i
would
carry
the
dispatches
and
if
any
of
the
boys
wished
to
go
along
i
would
like
to
have
them
for
company
sake
austin
reported
my
offer
to
the
commanding
officer
who
sent
for
me
and
said
he
would
be
happy
to
have
me
take
his
dispatches
if
i
could
stand
the
trip
on
top
of
all
that
i
had
already
done
all
i
want
is
a
good
fresh
horse
sir
said
i
i
am
sorry
to
say
that
we
have
a
decent
horse
here
but
we
have
a
reliable
and
honest
government
mule
if
that
will
do
you
said
the
officer
trot
out
your
mule
said
i
that
good
enough
for
me
i
am
ready
at
any
time
sir
the
mule
was
forthcoming
and
at
dark
i
pulled
out
for
fort
larned
and
proceeded
uninterruptedly
to
coon
creek
thirty
miles
out
from
dodge
i
had
left
the
main
wagon
road
some
distance
to
the
south
and
had
traveled
parallel
with
it
thinking
this
to
be
a
safer
course
as
the
indians
might
be
lying
in
wait
on
the
main
road
for
dispatch
bearers
and
scouts
at
coon
creek
i
dismounted
and
led
the
mule
by
the
bridle
down
to
the
water
where
i
took
a
drink
using
my
hat
for
a
dipper
while
i
was
engaged
in
getting
the
water
the
mule
jerked
loose
and
struck
out
down
the
creek
i
followed
him
in
hopes
that
he
would
catch
his
foot
in
the
bridle
rein
and
stop
but
this
he
seemed
to
have
no
idea
of
doing
he
was
making
straight
for
the
wagon
road
and
i
did
not
know
what
minute
he
might
run
into
a
band
of
indians
he
finally
got
on
the
road
but
instead
of
going
back
toward
fort
dodge
as
i
naturally
expected
he
would
do
he
turned
eastward
toward
fort
larned
and
kept
up
a
little
jog
trot
just
ahead
of
me
but
would
not
let
me
come
up
to
him
although
i
tried
it
again
and
again
i
had
my
gun
in
my
hand
and
several
times
i
was
strongly
tempted
to
shoot
him
and
would
probably
have
done
so
had
it
not
been
for
fear
of
bringing
indians
down
upon
me
and
besides
he
was
carrying
the
saddle
for
me
so
i
trudged
on
after
the
obstinate
critter
and
if
there
ever
was
a
government
mule
that
deserved
and
received
a
good
round
cursing
it
was
that
one
i
had
neglected
the
precaution
of
tying
one
end
of
my
lariat
to
his
bit
and
the
other
to
my
belt
as
i
had
done
a
few
nights
before
and
i
blamed
myself
for
this
gross
piece
of
negligence
mile
after
mile
i
kept
on
after
that
mule
and
every
once
in
a
while
i
indulged
in
strong
language
respecting
the
whole
mule
fraternity
from
coon
creek
to
fort
larned
it
was
miles
and
i
finally
concluded
that
my
prospects
were
good
for
hoofing
the
whole
distance
we
that
is
to
say
the
confounded
mule
and
myself
were
making
pretty
good
time
there
was
nothing
to
hold
the
mule
and
i
was
all
the
time
trying
to
catch
him
which
urged
him
on
i
made
every
step
count
for
i
wanted
to
reach
fort
larned
before
daylight
in
order
to
avoid
if
possible
the
indians
to
whom
it
would
have
been
pie
to
have
caught
me
there
on
foot
the
mule
stuck
to
the
road
and
kept
on
for
larned
and
i
did
the
same
thing
just
as
day
was
beginning
to
break
we
that
is
the
mule
and
myself
found
ourselves
on
a
hill
looking
down
into
the
valley
of
the
pawnee
fork
in
which
fort
larned
was
located
only
four
miles
away
and
when
the
morning
gun
belched
forth
we
were
within
half
a
mile
of
the
post
now
said
i
mule
it
is
my
turn
and
raising
my
gun
to
my
shoulder
in
dead
earnest
this
time
i
blazed
away
hitting
the
animal
in
the
hip
throwing
a
second
cartridge
into
the
gun
i
let
him
have
another
shot
and
i
continued
to
pour
the
lead
into
him
until
i
had
him
completely
laid
out
like
the
great
majority
of
government
mules
he
was
a
tough
one
to
kill
and
he
clung
to
life
with
all
the
tenaciousness
of
his
obstinate
nature
he
was
without
doubt
the
toughest
and
meanest
mule
i
ever
saw
and
he
died
hard
the
troops
hearing
the
reports
of
the
gun
came
rushing
out
to
see
what
was
the
matter
they
found
that
the
mule
had
passed
in
his
chips
and
when
they
learned
the
cause
they
all
agreed
that
i
had
served
him
just
right
taking
the
saddle
and
bridle
from
the
dead
body
i
proceeded
into
the
post
and
delivered
the
dispatches
to
captain
parker
i
then
went
over
to
dick
curtis
house
which
was
headquarters
for
the
scouts
and
there
put
in
several
hours
of
solid
sleep
during
the
day
general
hazen
returned
from
fort
harker
and
he
also
had
some
important
dispatches
to
send
to
general
sheridan
i
was
feeling
quite
elated
over
my
big
ride
and
seeing
that
i
was
getting
the
best
of
the
other
scouts
in
regard
to
making
a
record
i
volunteered
to
carry
general
hazen
dispatches
to
fort
hays
the
general
accepted
my
services
although
he
thought
it
was
unnecessary
for
me
to
kill
myself
i
told
him
that
i
had
business
at
fort
hays
and
wished
to
go
there
anyway
and
it
would
make
no
difference
to
the
other
scouts
for
none
of
them
appeared
willing
to
undertake
the
trip
accordingly
that
night
i
left
fort
larned
on
an
excellent
horse
and
next
morning
at
daylight
found
myself
once
more
in
general
headquarters
at
fort
hays
the
general
was
surprised
to
see
me
and
still
more
so
when
i
told
him
of
the
time
i
had
made
in
riding
to
fort
dodge
and
that
i
had
taken
dispatches
from
fort
dodge
to
fort
larned
and
when
in
addition
to
this
i
mentioned
my
journey
of
the
night
previous
general
sheridan
thought
my
ride
from
post
to
post
taken
as
a
whole
was
a
remarkable
one
and
he
said
that
he
did
not
know
of
its
equal
i
can
safely
say
that
i
have
never
heard
of
its
being
beaten
in
a
country
infested
with
hostile
indians
to
recapitulate
i
had
ridden
from
fort
larned
to
fort
zarah
a
distance
of
miles
and
back
in
twelve
hours
including
the
time
when
i
was
taken
across
the
arkansas
by
the
indians
in
the
succeeding
twelve
hours
i
had
gone
from
fort
larned
to
fort
hays
a
distance
of
miles
in
the
next
hours
i
had
gone
from
fort
hays
to
fort
dodge
a
distance
of
miles
the
following
night
i
had
traveled
from
fort
dodge
thirty
miles
on
muleback
and
miles
on
foot
to
fort
larned
and
the
next
night
miles
more
to
fort
hays
altogether
i
had
ridden
and
walked
miles
in
riding
hours
or
an
average
of
over
six
miles
an
hour
of
course
this
may
not
be
regarded
as
very
fast
riding
but
taking
into
consideration
the
fact
that
it
was
mostly
done
in
the
night
and
over
a
wild
country
with
no
roads
to
follow
and
that
i
had
to
be
continually
on
the
look
out
for
indians
it
was
thought
at
the
time
to
be
a
big
ride
as
well
as
a
most
dangerous
one
chapter
xvii
an
appointment
general
sheridan
highly
complimented
me
for
what
i
had
done
and
informed
me
that
i
need
not
report
back
to
general
hazen
as
he
had
more
important
work
for
me
to
do
he
told
me
that
the
fifth
cavalry
one
of
the
finest
regiments
in
the
army
was
on
its
way
to
the
department
of
the
missouri
and
that
he
was
going
to
send
it
on
an
expedition
against
the
dog
soldier
indians
who
were
infesting
the
republican
river
region
cody
continued
he
i
have
decided
to
appoint
you
as
guide
and
chief
of
scouts
with
the
command
how
does
that
suit
you
general
and
i
thank
you
for
the
honor
i
replied
as
gracefully
as
i
knew
how
the
dog
soldier
indians
were
a
band
of
cheyennes
and
unruly
turbulent
members
of
other
tribes
who
would
not
enter
into
any
treaty
or
keep
a
treaty
if
they
made
one
and
who
had
always
refused
to
go
upon
a
reservation
they
were
a
warlike
body
of
daring
and
restless
braves
and
were
determined
to
hold
possession
of
the
country
in
the
vicinity
of
the
republican
and
solomon
rivers
they
were
called
dog
soldiers
because
they
were
principally
cheyennes
a
name
derived
from
the
french
a
dog
after
my
conversation
with
the
general
i
went
over
to
hays
city
where
i
met
some
of
general
forsyth
scouts
who
had
just
returned
from
one
of
the
severest
battles
ever
fought
with
the
indians
as
it
will
not
be
out
of
place
in
this
connection
i
will
here
give
a
brief
history
of
that
memorable
event
illustration
general
phil
sheridan
the
indians
had
become
quite
troublesome
and
general
sheridan
had
selected
general
george
forsyth
to
go
out
on
an
expedition
and
punish
them
for
their
recent
depredations
there
was
a
scarcity
of
troops
at
fort
hays
at
that
time
so
general
forsyth
recruited
a
company
of
frontiersmen
who
could
move
rapidly
as
they
were
to
carry
no
luggage
and
were
to
travel
without
the
ordinary
transportation
thirty
of
these
frontiersmen
came
from
fort
harker
and
twenty
from
fort
hays
it
was
certainly
a
small
body
of
men
but
nearly
every
one
of
them
was
an
experienced
hunter
guide
scout
and
and
they
could
fight
the
in
their
own
way
in
four
days
they
were
prepared
to
take
the
field
and
on
the
morning
of
the
of
august
they
rode
out
of
fort
hays
to
meet
the
indians
lieutenant
beecher
of
the
third
infantry
nephew
of
henry
ward
beecher
was
second
in
command
brevet
mccall
who
had
been
in
the
volunteer
army
acted
as
first
sergeant
john
mowers
of
hays
city
who
had
been
a
volunteer
army
surgeon
was
the
surgeon
of
the
expedition
and
sharpe
grover
was
the
chief
guide
resting
at
fort
wallace
they
started
september
for
the
town
of
sheridan
thirteen
miles
distant
where
a
band
of
indians
had
attacked
a
train
killed
two
teamsters
and
stolen
some
cattle
arriving
at
sheridan
they
easily
found
the
indian
trail
and
followed
it
for
some
distance
on
the
eighth
day
out
from
fort
wallace
the
command
went
into
camp
late
in
the
afternoon
on
the
arickaree
which
was
then
not
more
than
eight
or
nine
feet
wide
at
that
point
and
only
two
or
three
inches
deep
it
was
evident
to
the
men
that
they
were
not
far
from
the
indians
and
it
was
decided
that
the
next
day
they
would
find
them
and
give
them
a
fight
early
next
morning
september
the
cry
of
indians
startled
the
command
every
man
jumped
for
his
horse
a
yelling
and
whooping
and
making
a
hideous
racket
and
firing
their
guns
rode
up
and
attempted
to
stampede
the
horses
several
of
which
together
with
the
four
were
so
frightened
that
they
broke
loose
and
got
away
the
indians
then
rode
off
followed
by
a
few
shots
in
a
minute
afterwards
hundreds
of
indian
warriors
it
was
estimated
that
there
were
nearly
one
thousand
came
galloping
down
upon
the
command
from
every
quarter
completely
hemming
them
in
acting
under
the
order
of
general
forsyth
the
men
retreated
to
a
small
island
tied
their
horses
in
a
circle
to
the
bushes
and
then
throwing
themselves
upon
the
ground
they
began
the
defense
by
firing
at
the
approaching
enemy
who
came
pretty
close
and
gave
them
a
raking
fire
the
besieged
scouts
at
the
first
opportunity
threw
up
a
small
breastwork
with
their
knives
the
firing
however
continued
back
and
forth
and
early
in
the
fight
forsyth
was
twice
seriously
wounded
once
in
the
right
thigh
and
once
in
the
left
leg
mowers
was
also
wounded
in
the
head
and
soon
died
two
other
men
had
been
killed
and
several
wounded
all
the
horses
of
the
command
were
killed
by
nine
in
the
morning
shortly
afterwards
over
three
hundred
indians
commanded
by
old
roman
nose
charged
down
upon
the
little
band
of
heroes
giving
them
volley
after
volley
but
finally
the
scouts
at
a
favorable
opportunity
returned
their
fire
with
telling
effect
roman
nose
and
medicine
man
were
killed
and
fell
from
their
horses
when
within
less
than
one
rod
of
the
scouts
who
thereupon
sent
up
a
triumphant
shout
the
charging
braves
now
weakened
and
in
a
few
moments
they
were
driven
back
it
was
a
brilliant
charge
and
was
most
nobly
and
bravely
repulsed
the
scouts
had
again
suffered
severely
having
several
men
wounded
among
the
number
being
lieutenant
beecher
who
died
that
night
the
indians
too
had
had
quite
a
number
killed
several
of
whom
had
fallen
close
to
the
earthworks
the
dismounted
indian
warriors
still
continued
firing
but
as
the
scouts
had
thrown
up
their
intrenchments
sufficiently
to
protect
themselves
by
closely
hugging
the
ground
little
or
no
damage
was
done
a
second
charge
was
made
by
the
mounted
indians
about
two
in
the
afternoon
and
they
were
again
repulsed
with
a
severe
loss
darkness
finally
came
on
and
then
ensued
a
cessation
of
hostilities
two
of
the
scouts
had
been
killed
four
fatally
wounded
and
fourteen
others
were
wounded
more
or
less
severely
there
were
just
men
left
out
of
the
fifty
the
supplies
had
run
out
and
as
mowers
had
been
mortally
wounded
and
the
medical
stores
captured
the
wounded
men
could
not
be
properly
cared
for
although
they
were
entirely
surrounded
and
one
hundred
and
ten
miles
from
the
nearest
post
the
men
did
not
despair
they
had
an
abundance
of
ammunition
plenty
of
water
under
ground
only
a
short
distance
and
for
food
they
had
their
horses
and
mules
at
night
two
of
the
scouts
tradeau
and
stillwell
stole
through
the
lines
of
the
indians
and
started
swiftly
for
fort
wallace
to
obtain
relief
it
was
a
dangerous
undertaking
but
they
were
brave
and
experienced
scouts
stillwell
was
only
nineteen
or
twenty
years
old
but
he
was
in
every
sense
of
the
word
a
thoroughbred
frontiersman
during
the
night
the
besieged
scouts
threw
up
their
breastworks
considerably
higher
and
piled
the
dead
animals
on
top
they
dug
down
to
water
and
also
stored
away
a
lot
of
horse
and
mule
meat
in
the
sand
to
keep
it
fresh
as
long
as
possible
the
indians
renewed
their
firing
next
morning
and
kept
it
up
all
day
doing
but
little
injury
however
as
the
scouts
were
now
well
entrenched
but
many
an
indian
was
sent
to
his
happy
hunting
ground
illustration
battle
on
the
arickaree
night
came
again
and
the
prospects
were
indeed
gloomy
an
attempt
was
made
by
two
more
of
the
scouts
to
creep
through
the
indian
lines
but
they
were
detected
by
the
enemy
and
had
to
return
to
their
comrades
the
next
morning
the
indians
renewed
hostilities
as
usual
their
women
and
children
began
to
disappear
about
noon
and
then
the
indians
tried
to
draw
the
scouts
out
by
displaying
a
white
flag
for
a
truce
they
appeared
to
want
to
have
a
talk
with
general
forsyth
but
as
their
treachery
was
the
scouts
did
not
fall
into
this
trap
the
indians
had
apparently
become
tired
of
fighting
especially
as
they
found
that
they
had
a
most
stubborn
foe
to
deal
with
night
once
more
threw
its
mantle
over
the
scene
and
under
the
cover
of
the
darkness
donovan
and
plyley
two
of
the
best
scouts
stealthily
made
their
way
out
of
the
camp
and
started
for
fort
wallace
with
a
dispatch
from
general
forsyth
who
gave
a
brief
summary
of
the
situation
and
stated
that
if
necessary
he
could
hold
out
for
six
days
longer
when
the
day
dawned
again
only
a
small
number
of
warriors
could
be
seen
and
they
probably
remained
to
watch
the
scouts
and
keep
them
corraled
the
uninjured
men
attended
to
the
wounded
as
well
as
they
could
under
the
adverse
circumstances
but
from
want
of
proper
treatment
evidences
of
gangrene
appeared
in
some
of
the
wounds
on
the
sixth
day
the
mule
and
horse
meat
became
totally
unfit
for
use
but
they
had
nothing
else
to
eat
and
had
to
eat
it
or
starve
under
these
trying
circumstances
the
general
told
the
men
that
any
who
wished
to
go
might
do
so
and
take
their
chances
but
they
all
resolved
to
remain
and
die
together
if
need
be
relief
came
at
last
tradeau
and
stillwell
had
safely
reached
fort
wallace
and
on
the
morning
of
the
of
september
colonel
carpenter
and
a
detachment
of
cavalry
arrived
with
supplies
this
assistance
to
the
besieged
and
starving
scouts
came
like
a
vessel
to
men
drifting
and
starving
on
a
raft
in
it
was
with
the
survivors
of
this
terrible
fight
that
i
spent
the
few
days
at
hays
city
prior
to
the
arrival
of
the
fifth
cavalry
chapter
xviii
scouting
on
the
third
day
of
october
the
fifth
cavalry
arrived
at
fort
hays
and
i
at
once
began
making
the
acquaintance
of
the
different
officers
of
the
regiment
i
was
introduced
by
general
sheridan
to
colonel
william
royal
who
was
in
command
of
the
regiment
he
was
a
gallant
officer
and
an
agreeable
and
pleasant
gentleman
he
is
now
stationed
at
omaha
as
inspector
general
in
the
department
of
the
platte
i
also
became
acquainted
with
major
brown
major
walker
captain
sweetman
quartermaster
hays
and
in
fact
all
the
officers
of
the
regiment
general
sheridan
being
anxious
to
punish
the
indians
who
had
lately
fought
general
forsyth
did
not
give
the
regiment
much
of
a
rest
and
accordingly
on
the
of
october
it
began
its
march
for
the
beaver
creek
country
the
first
night
we
camped
on
the
south
fork
of
big
creek
four
miles
west
of
hays
city
by
this
time
i
had
become
pretty
well
acquainted
with
major
brown
and
captain
sweetman
who
invited
me
to
mess
with
them
on
this
expedition
and
a
jolly
mess
we
had
there
were
other
scouts
in
the
command
besides
myself
and
i
particularly
remember
tom
renahan
hank
fields
and
a
character
called
nosey
on
account
of
his
long
nose
on
the
morning
of
the
we
pulled
out
to
the
north
and
during
the
day
i
was
very
favorably
struck
with
the
appearance
of
the
regiment
it
was
a
beautiful
command
and
when
strung
out
on
the
prairie
with
a
train
of
wagons
ambulances
and
pack
mules
i
felt
very
proud
of
my
position
as
guide
and
chief
of
scouts
of
such
a
warlike
expedition
just
as
we
were
about
to
go
into
camp
on
the
saline
river
that
night
we
ran
on
to
a
band
of
about
fifteen
indians
who
seeing
us
dashed
across
the
creek
followed
by
some
bullets
which
we
sent
after
them
but
as
the
small
band
proved
to
be
a
scouting
party
we
pursued
them
only
a
mile
or
two
when
our
attention
was
directed
to
a
herd
of
buffaloes
they
being
very
plenty
and
we
succeeded
in
killing
ten
or
fifteen
for
the
command
the
next
day
we
marched
thirty
miles
and
late
in
the
afternoon
we
went
into
camp
on
the
south
fork
of
the
solomon
at
this
encampment
colonel
royal
asked
me
to
go
out
and
kill
some
buffaloes
for
the
boys
all
right
colonel
send
along
a
wagon
or
two
to
bring
in
the
meat
i
said
i
am
not
in
the
habit
of
sending
out
my
wagons
until
i
know
that
there
is
something
to
be
hauled
in
kill
your
buffalo
first
and
then
i
send
out
the
wagons
was
the
colonel
reply
i
said
no
more
but
went
out
on
a
hunt
and
after
a
short
absence
returned
and
asked
the
colonel
to
send
his
wagons
over
the
hill
for
the
half
dozen
buffaloes
i
had
killed
the
following
afternoon
he
again
requested
me
to
go
out
and
get
some
fresh
buffalo
meat
i
did
ask
him
for
any
wagons
this
time
but
rode
out
some
distance
and
coming
up
with
a
small
herd
i
managed
to
get
seven
of
them
headed
straight
for
the
encampment
and
instead
of
shooting
them
just
then
i
ran
them
at
full
speed
right
into
the
camp
and
then
killed
them
all
one
after
the
other
in
rapid
succession
colonel
royal
witnessed
the
whole
proceeding
which
puzzled
him
somewhat
as
he
could
see
no
reason
why
i
had
not
killed
them
on
the
prairie
he
came
up
rather
angrily
and
demanded
an
explanation
i
ca
allow
any
such
business
as
this
cody
said
he
what
do
you
mean
by
it
i
did
care
about
asking
for
any
wagons
this
time
colonel
so
i
thought
i
would
make
the
buffaloes
furnish
their
own
transportation
was
my
reply
the
colonel
saw
the
point
in
a
moment
and
had
no
more
to
say
on
the
subject
illustration
bringing
meat
into
camp
no
indians
had
been
seen
in
the
vicinity
during
the
day
and
colonel
royal
having
carefully
posted
his
pickets
supposed
everything
was
serene
for
the
night
but
before
morning
we
were
roused
from
our
slumbers
by
hearing
shots
fired
and
immediately
afterwards
one
of
the
mounted
pickets
came
galloping
into
camp
saying
that
there
were
indians
close
at
hand
the
companies
all
fell
into
line
and
were
soon
prepared
and
anxious
to
give
the
battle
but
as
the
men
were
yet
new
in
the
indian
country
a
great
many
of
them
were
considerably
excited
no
indians
however
made
their
appearance
and
upon
going
to
the
where
the
picket
said
he
had
seen
them
none
could
be
found
nor
could
any
traces
of
them
be
discovered
the
sentinel
who
was
an
irishman
insisted
that
there
certainly
had
been
there
illustration
indians
but
you
must
be
mistaken
said
colonel
royal
upon
me
sowl
colonel
i
not
as
shure
ez
me
name
pat
maloney
one
of
thim
rid
divils
hit
me
on
the
head
wid
a
club
so
he
did
said
pat
and
so
when
morning
came
the
mystery
was
further
investigated
and
was
easily
solved
elk
tracks
were
found
in
the
vicinity
and
it
was
undoubtedly
a
herd
of
elks
that
had
frightened
pat
as
he
had
turned
to
run
he
had
gone
under
a
limb
of
a
tree
against
which
he
hit
his
head
and
supposed
he
had
been
struck
by
a
club
in
the
hands
of
an
indian
it
was
hard
to
convince
pat
however
of
the
truth
a
three
days
uninteresting
march
brought
us
to
beaver
creek
where
we
camped
and
from
which
point
scouting
parties
were
sent
out
in
different
directions
neither
of
these
parties
discovering
indians
they
all
returned
to
camp
about
the
same
time
finding
it
in
a
state
of
great
excitement
it
having
been
attacked
a
few
hours
previous
by
a
party
of
indians
who
had
succeeded
in
killing
two
men
and
in
making
off
with
sixty
horses
belonging
to
that
evening
the
command
started
on
the
trail
of
these
indian
major
brown
with
two
companies
and
three
days
rations
pushing
ahead
in
advance
of
the
main
command
being
unsuccessful
however
in
overtaking
the
indians
and
getting
nearly
out
of
provisions
it
being
our
eighteenth
day
out
the
entire
command
marched
towards
the
nearest
railroad
point
and
camped
on
the
saline
river
distant
three
miles
from
buffalo
tank
while
waiting
for
supplies
we
received
a
new
commanding
officer
brevet
carr
who
was
the
senior
major
of
the
regiment
and
who
ranked
colonel
royal
he
brought
with
him
the
now
celebrated
forsyth
scouts
who
were
commanded
by
lieutenant
pepoon
a
regular
army
officer
illustration
carr
it
was
also
while
waiting
in
this
camp
that
major
brown
received
a
new
lieutenant
to
fill
a
vacancy
in
his
company
on
the
day
that
this
officer
was
to
arrive
major
brown
had
his
private
ambulance
brought
out
and
invited
me
to
accompany
him
to
the
railroad
station
to
meet
his
lieutenant
whose
name
was
bache
he
proved
to
be
a
fine
gentleman
and
a
brave
dashing
officer
on
the
way
to
the
dépôt
major
brown
had
said
now
cody
when
we
come
back
we
give
bache
a
lively
ride
and
shake
him
up
a
little
major
brown
was
a
jolly
good
fellow
but
sometimes
he
would
get
a
little
off
and
as
this
was
one
of
his
off
days
he
was
bound
to
amuse
himself
in
some
original
and
mischievous
way
reaching
the
dépôt
just
as
the
train
came
in
we
easily
found
the
lieutenant
and
giving
him
the
back
seat
in
the
ambulance
we
were
soon
headed
for
camp
pretty
soon
major
brown
took
the
reins
from
his
driver
and
at
once
began
whipping
the
mules
after
getting
them
into
a
lively
gallop
he
pulled
out
his
revolver
and
fired
several
shots
the
road
was
terribly
rough
and
the
night
was
so
dark
that
we
could
hardly
see
where
we
were
going
it
was
a
wonderful
piece
of
luck
that
we
were
not
tipped
over
and
our
necks
broken
finally
bache
said
is
this
the
way
you
break
in
all
your
lieutenants
major
oh
no
i
do
do
this
as
a
regular
thing
but
it
the
way
we
frequently
ride
in
this
country
said
the
major
just
keep
your
seat
bache
and
we
take
you
through
on
time
the
major
appropriated
the
reply
of
the
old
california
stage
driver
hank
monk
to
horace
greely
we
were
now
rattling
down
a
steep
hill
at
full
speed
and
just
as
we
reached
the
bottom
the
front
wheels
struck
a
deep
ditch
over
which
the
mules
had
jumped
we
were
all
brought
up
standing
by
the
sudden
stoppage
of
the
ambulance
major
brown
and
myself
were
nearly
pitched
out
on
the
wheels
while
the
lieutenant
came
flying
headlong
from
the
back
seat
to
the
front
of
the
vehicle
take
a
back
seat
lieutenant
coolly
said
major
brown
major
i
have
just
left
that
seat
said
bache
we
soon
lifted
the
wagon
out
of
the
ditch
and
then
resumed
our
drive
running
into
camp
under
full
headway
and
creating
considerable
amusement
every
one
recognized
the
ambulance
and
knew
at
once
that
major
brown
and
i
were
out
on
a
lark
and
therefore
there
was
not
much
said
about
our
exploit
halting
with
a
grand
flourish
in
front
of
his
tent
major
brown
jumped
out
in
his
most
gallant
style
and
politely
asked
his
lieutenant
in
a
very
pleasant
evening
was
spent
there
quite
a
number
of
the
officers
calling
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
the
new
officer
who
entertained
the
visitors
with
an
amusing
account
of
the
ride
from
the
dépôt
next
morning
at
an
early
hour
the
command
started
out
on
a
hunt
for
indians
general
carr
having
a
pretty
good
idea
where
he
would
be
most
likely
to
find
them
directed
me
to
guide
him
by
the
nearest
route
to
elephant
rock
on
beaver
creek
upon
arriving
at
the
south
fork
of
the
beaver
on
the
second
day
march
we
discovered
a
large
fresh
indian
trail
which
we
hurriedly
followed
for
a
distance
of
eight
miles
when
suddenly
we
saw
on
the
bluffs
ahead
of
us
quite
a
large
number
of
indians
general
carr
ordered
lieutenant
pepoon
scouts
and
company
m
to
the
front
this
company
was
commanded
by
lieutenant
schinosky
a
frenchman
by
birth
and
a
reckless
by
nature
who
was
anxious
to
have
a
match
having
advanced
his
company
nearly
a
mile
ahead
of
the
main
command
about
four
hundred
indians
suddenly
charged
down
upon
him
and
gave
him
a
lively
little
fight
until
he
was
supported
by
our
full
force
the
indians
kept
increasing
in
numbers
all
the
while
until
it
was
estimated
that
we
were
fighting
from
eight
hundred
to
one
thousand
of
them
the
engagement
became
quite
general
and
several
were
killed
and
wounded
on
each
side
the
indians
were
evidently
fighting
to
give
their
families
and
village
a
chance
to
get
away
we
had
undoubtedly
surprised
them
with
a
larger
force
than
they
had
expected
to
see
in
that
part
of
the
country
we
fought
them
until
dark
all
the
time
driving
them
before
us
at
night
they
annoyed
us
considerably
by
firing
down
into
our
camp
from
the
higher
hills
and
several
times
the
command
was
ordered
out
to
dislodge
them
from
their
position
and
drive
them
back
after
having
returned
from
one
of
these
little
sallies
major
brown
captain
sweetman
lieutenant
bache
and
myself
were
taking
supper
together
when
whang
came
a
bullet
into
lieutenant
bache
plate
breaking
a
hole
through
it
the
bullet
came
from
the
gun
of
one
of
the
indians
who
had
returned
to
the
high
bluff
our
camp
major
brown
declared
it
was
a
crack
shot
because
it
broke
the
plate
we
finished
our
supper
without
having
any
more
such
close
calls
at
daylight
next
morning
we
struck
out
on
the
trail
and
soon
came
to
the
spot
where
the
indians
had
camped
the
day
before
we
could
see
that
their
village
was
a
very
large
one
consisting
of
about
five
hundred
lodges
and
we
pushed
forward
rapidly
from
this
point
on
the
trail
which
ran
back
toward
prairie
dog
creek
about
two
we
came
in
sight
of
the
retreating
village
and
soon
the
warriors
turned
back
to
give
us
battle
they
set
fire
to
the
prairie
grass
in
front
of
us
and
on
all
sides
in
order
to
delay
us
as
much
as
possible
we
kept
up
a
running
fight
for
the
remainder
of
the
afternoon
and
the
indians
repeatedly
attempted
to
lead
us
off
the
track
of
their
flying
village
but
their
trail
was
easily
followed
as
they
were
continually
dropping
tepee
poles
camp
kettles
robes
furs
and
all
heavy
articles
belonging
to
them
they
were
evidently
scattering
and
it
finally
became
difficult
for
us
to
keep
on
the
main
trail
when
darkness
set
in
we
went
into
camp
it
being
useless
to
try
to
follow
the
indians
after
nightfall
next
morning
we
were
again
on
the
trail
which
led
north
and
back
towards
the
beaver
creek
which
stream
it
crossed
within
a
few
miles
of
the
spot
where
we
had
first
discovered
the
indians
they
having
made
nearly
a
complete
circle
in
hopes
of
misleading
us
late
in
the
afternoon
we
again
saw
them
going
over
a
hill
far
ahead
of
us
and
towards
evening
the
main
body
of
warriors
came
back
and
fought
us
once
more
but
we
continued
to
drive
them
until
darkness
set
in
when
we
camped
for
the
night
the
indians
soon
scattered
in
every
direction
but
we
followed
the
main
trail
to
the
republican
river
where
we
made
a
and
then
went
north
towards
the
platte
river
we
found
however
that
the
indians
by
traveling
night
and
day
had
got
a
long
start
and
the
general
concluded
that
it
was
useless
to
follow
them
any
further
as
we
had
pushed
them
so
hard
and
given
them
such
a
scare
that
they
would
leave
the
republican
country
and
go
north
across
the
union
pacific
railroad
most
of
the
indians
as
he
had
predicted
did
cross
the
platte
river
near
ogallala
on
the
union
pacific
and
thence
continued
northward
that
night
we
returned
to
the
republican
river
and
camped
in
a
grove
of
cottonwoods
which
i
named
carr
grove
in
honor
of
the
commanding
officer
the
general
told
me
that
the
next
day
march
would
be
towards
the
of
the
beaver
and
he
asked
me
the
distance
i
replied
that
it
was
about
miles
and
he
said
we
would
make
it
the
next
day
getting
an
early
start
in
the
morning
we
struck
out
across
the
prairie
my
position
as
guide
being
ahead
of
the
advance
guard
about
two
general
carr
overtook
me
and
asked
how
far
i
supposed
it
was
to
water
i
thought
it
was
about
eight
miles
although
we
could
see
no
sign
or
indication
of
any
stream
in
our
front
pepoon
scouts
say
that
you
are
going
in
the
wrong
direction
said
the
general
and
in
the
way
you
are
bearing
it
will
be
fifteen
miles
before
you
can
strike
any
of
the
branches
of
the
beaver
and
that
when
you
do
you
will
find
no
water
for
the
beavers
are
dry
at
this
time
of
the
year
at
that
point
general
i
think
the
scouts
are
mistaken
said
i
for
the
beaver
has
more
water
near
its
head
than
it
has
below
and
at
the
place
where
we
will
strike
the
stream
we
will
find
immense
beaver
dams
large
enough
and
strong
enough
to
cross
the
whole
command
if
you
wish
well
cody
go
ahead
said
he
i
leave
it
to
you
but
remember
that
i
do
want
a
dry
camp
no
danger
of
that
said
i
and
then
i
rode
on
leaving
him
to
return
to
the
command
as
i
had
predicted
we
found
water
seven
or
eight
miles
further
on
where
we
came
upon
a
beautiful
little
stream
a
tributary
of
the
beaver
hidden
in
the
hills
we
had
no
difficulty
in
selecting
a
good
halting
place
and
obtaining
fresh
spring
water
and
excellent
grass
the
general
upon
learning
from
me
that
the
stream
which
was
only
eight
or
nine
miles
long
had
no
name
took
out
his
map
and
located
it
and
named
it
cody
creek
which
name
it
still
bears
we
pulled
out
early
next
morning
for
the
beaver
and
when
we
were
approaching
the
stream
i
rode
on
ahead
of
the
advance
guard
in
order
to
find
a
crossing
just
as
i
turned
a
bend
of
the
creek
bang
went
a
shot
and
down
went
my
horse
myself
with
him
i
disentangled
myself
and
jumped
behind
the
dead
body
looking
in
the
direction
whence
the
shot
had
come
i
saw
two
indians
and
at
once
turned
my
gun
loose
on
them
but
in
the
excitement
of
the
moment
i
missed
my
aim
they
fired
two
or
three
more
shots
and
i
returned
the
compliment
wounding
one
of
their
horses
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
creek
going
over
the
hill
i
observed
a
few
lodges
moving
rapidly
away
and
also
some
mounted
warriors
who
could
see
me
and
who
kept
blazing
away
with
their
guns
the
two
indians
who
had
fired
at
me
and
had
killed
my
horse
were
retreating
across
the
creek
on
a
beaver
dam
i
sent
a
few
shots
after
them
to
accelerate
their
speed
and
also
fired
at
the
ones
on
the
other
side
of
the
stream
i
was
undecided
as
to
whether
it
was
best
to
run
back
to
the
command
on
foot
or
hold
my
position
i
knew
that
within
a
few
minutes
the
troops
would
come
up
and
if
they
heard
the
firing
they
would
come
rapidly
the
indians
seeing
that
i
was
alone
turned
and
charged
down
the
hill
and
were
about
to
the
creek
to
corral
me
when
the
advance
guard
of
the
command
put
in
an
appearance
on
the
ridge
and
dashed
forward
to
my
rescue
the
whirled
and
made
off
when
general
carr
came
up
he
ordered
company
i
to
go
in
pursuit
of
the
band
i
accompanied
lieutenant
brady
who
commanded
and
we
had
a
running
fight
with
the
indians
lasting
several
hours
we
captured
several
head
of
their
horses
and
most
of
their
lodges
at
night
we
returned
to
the
command
which
by
this
time
had
crossed
the
creek
on
the
beaver
dam
we
scouted
for
several
days
along
the
river
and
had
two
or
three
lively
skirmishes
finally
our
supplies
began
to
run
low
and
general
carr
gave
orders
to
return
to
fort
wallace
which
we
reached
three
days
afterwards
and
where
we
remained
several
days
while
the
regiment
was
waiting
here
for
orders
i
spent
most
of
the
time
in
hunting
buffaloes
and
one
day
while
i
was
out
with
a
small
party
we
were
jumped
by
about
fifty
indians
we
had
a
severe
fight
of
at
least
an
hour
when
we
succeeded
in
driving
the
enemy
they
lost
four
of
their
warriors
and
probably
concluded
that
we
were
a
hard
crowd
i
had
some
excellent
marksmen
with
me
and
they
did
some
fine
work
sending
the
bullets
thick
and
fast
where
they
would
do
the
most
good
two
or
three
of
our
horses
had
been
hit
and
one
man
had
been
wounded
we
were
ready
and
willing
to
stay
with
the
as
long
as
they
wished
but
they
finally
gave
it
up
however
as
a
bad
job
and
rode
off
we
finished
our
hunt
and
went
back
to
the
post
loaded
down
with
plenty
of
buffalo
meat
and
received
the
compliments
of
the
general
for
our
little
fight

chapter
xix
a
tough
time
general
carr
soon
received
orders
from
general
sheridan
that
he
was
to
make
a
winter
campaign
in
the
canadian
river
country
and
that
we
were
to
proceed
to
fort
lyon
on
the
arkansas
river
in
colorado
and
there
fit
out
for
the
expedition
leaving
fort
wallace
in
november
we
arrived
at
fort
lyon
in
the
latter
part
of
the
month
and
outfitted
for
the
coming
expedition
general
penrose
had
left
this
post
three
weeks
previously
with
a
command
of
some
three
hundred
men
he
had
taken
no
wagons
with
him
and
his
supply
train
was
composed
only
of
pack
mules
general
carr
was
ordered
to
follow
with
supplies
on
his
trail
and
overtake
him
as
soon
as
possible
i
was
particularly
anxious
to
catch
up
with
penrose
command
as
my
old
friend
wild
bill
was
among
his
scouts
we
followed
the
trail
very
easily
for
the
first
three
days
and
then
we
were
caught
in
canyon
by
a
fearful
snow
storm
which
compelled
us
to
go
into
camp
for
a
day
the
ground
now
being
covered
with
snow
we
found
that
it
would
be
almost
impossible
to
follow
penrose
trail
any
further
especially
as
he
had
left
no
sign
to
indicate
the
direction
he
was
going
general
carr
sent
for
me
and
said
that
as
it
was
very
important
that
we
should
not
lose
the
trail
he
wished
that
i
would
take
some
scouts
with
me
and
while
the
command
remained
in
camp
push
on
as
far
as
possible
and
see
if
i
could
not
discover
some
traces
of
penrose
or
where
he
had
camped
at
any
time
illustration
camping
in
the
snow
accompanied
by
four
men
i
started
out
in
the
blinding
snow
storm
taking
a
southerly
direction
we
rode
miles
and
upon
reaching
a
tributary
of
the
cimarron
we
scouted
up
and
down
the
stream
for
a
few
miles
and
finally
found
one
of
penrose
old
camps
it
was
now
late
in
the
afternoon
and
as
the
command
would
come
up
the
next
day
it
was
not
necessary
for
all
of
us
to
return
with
the
information
to
general
carr
so
riding
down
into
a
sheltered
place
in
a
bend
of
the
creek
we
built
a
fire
and
broiled
some
venison
from
a
deer
which
we
had
shot
during
the
day
and
after
eating
a
substantial
meal
i
left
the
four
men
there
while
i
returned
to
bring
up
the
troops
it
was
eleven
at
night
when
i
got
back
to
the
camp
a
light
was
still
burning
in
the
general
tent
he
having
remained
awake
anxiously
awaiting
my
return
he
was
glad
to
see
me
and
was
overjoyed
at
the
information
i
brought
for
he
had
great
fears
concerning
the
safety
of
general
penrose
he
roused
up
his
cook
and
ordered
him
to
get
me
a
good
hot
supper
all
of
which
i
greatly
appreciated
i
passed
the
night
in
the
general
tent
and
next
morning
rose
refreshed
and
prepared
for
a
big
day
work
the
command
took
up
its
march
next
day
for
the
cimarron
and
had
a
hard
tramp
of
it
on
account
of
the
snow
having
drifted
to
a
great
depth
in
many
of
the
ravines
and
in
some
places
the
teamsters
had
to
shovel
their
way
through
we
arrived
at
the
cimarron
at
sundown
and
went
into
a
nice
warm
camp
upon
looking
around
next
morning
we
found
that
penrose
having
been
unencumbered
by
wagons
had
kept
on
the
west
side
of
the
cimarron
and
the
country
was
so
rough
that
it
was
impossible
for
us
to
stay
on
his
trail
with
our
wagons
but
knowing
that
he
would
certainly
follow
down
the
river
general
carr
concluded
to
take
the
best
wagon
route
along
the
stream
which
i
discovered
to
be
on
the
east
side
before
we
could
make
any
headway
with
our
wagon
train
we
had
to
leave
the
river
and
get
out
on
the
divide
we
were
very
fortunate
that
day
in
finding
a
splendid
road
for
some
distance
until
we
were
all
at
once
brought
up
standing
on
a
high
overlooking
a
beautiful
winding
creek
that
lay
far
below
us
in
the
valley
the
question
that
troubled
us
was
how
we
were
to
get
the
wagons
down
we
were
now
in
the
of
the
rattoon
mountains
and
the
bluff
we
were
on
was
very
steep
cody
we
in
a
nice
fix
now
said
general
carr
oh
that
nothing
was
my
reply
but
you
can
never
take
the
train
down
said
he
never
you
mind
the
train
general
you
say
you
are
looking
for
a
good
camp
how
does
that
beautiful
spot
down
in
the
valley
suit
you
i
asked
him
that
will
do
i
can
easily
descend
with
the
cavalry
but
how
to
get
the
wagons
down
there
is
a
puzzler
to
me
said
he
by
the
time
you
located
your
camp
your
wagons
shall
be
there
said
i
all
right
cody
i
leave
it
to
you
as
you
seem
to
want
to
be
boss
replied
he
pleasantly
he
at
once
ordered
the
command
to
dismount
and
lead
the
horses
down
the
the
wagon
train
was
a
mile
in
the
rear
and
when
it
came
up
one
of
the
drivers
asked
how
are
we
going
down
there
run
down
slide
down
or
fall
down
any
way
to
get
down
said
i
we
never
can
do
it
it
too
steep
the
wagons
will
run
over
the
mules
said
another
i
guess
not
the
mules
have
got
to
keep
out
of
the
way
was
my
reply
telling
wilson
the
chief
to
bring
on
his
which
was
at
the
head
of
the
train
i
said
i
would
try
the
experiment
at
least
wilson
drove
the
team
and
wagon
to
the
brink
of
the
hill
and
following
my
directions
he
brought
out
some
extra
chains
with
which
we
locked
both
wheels
on
each
side
and
then
them
we
then
started
the
wagon
down
the
hill
the
or
rather
the
were
good
on
the
and
we
got
along
finely
until
we
nearly
reached
the
bottom
when
the
wagon
crowded
the
mules
so
hard
that
they
started
on
a
run
and
galloped
down
into
the
valley
and
to
the
place
where
general
carr
had
located
his
camp
three
other
wagons
immediately
followed
in
the
same
way
and
in
half
an
hour
every
wagon
was
in
camp
without
the
least
accident
having
occurred
it
was
indeed
an
exciting
sight
to
see
the
teams
come
straight
down
the
mountain
and
finally
break
into
a
full
run
at
times
it
looked
as
if
the
wagons
would
turn
a
somersault
and
land
on
the
mules
this
proved
to
be
a
lucky
march
for
us
as
far
as
gaining
on
penrose
was
concerned
for
the
route
he
had
taken
on
the
west
side
of
the
stream
turned
out
to
be
a
bad
one
and
we
went
with
our
immense
wagon
train
as
far
in
one
day
as
penrose
had
in
seven
his
command
had
marched
on
to
a
plateau
or
high
so
steep
that
not
even
a
pack
mule
could
descend
it
and
he
was
obliged
to
retrace
his
steps
a
long
ways
thus
losing
three
days
time
as
we
afterwards
learned
while
in
this
camp
we
had
a
lively
turkey
hunt
the
trees
along
the
banks
of
the
stream
were
literally
alive
with
wild
turkeys
and
after
unsaddling
the
horses
between
two
and
three
hundred
soldiers
surrounded
a
grove
of
timber
and
had
a
grand
turkey
killing
four
or
five
hundred
of
the
birds
with
guns
clubs
and
stones
of
course
we
had
turkey
in
every
style
after
this
hunt
roast
turkey
boiled
turkey
fried
turkey
turkey
on
toast
and
so
on
and
we
appropriately
called
this
place
camp
turkey
from
this
point
on
for
several
days
we
had
no
trouble
in
following
penrose
trail
which
led
us
in
a
southeasterly
direction
towards
the
canadian
river
no
indians
were
seen
nor
any
signs
of
them
found
one
day
while
riding
in
advance
of
the
command
down
san
francisco
creek
i
heard
some
one
calling
my
name
from
a
little
bunch
of
willow
brush
on
the
opposite
bank
and
upon
looking
closely
at
the
spot
i
saw
a
negro
sakes
alive
massa
bill
am
dat
you
asked
the
man
whom
i
recognized
as
one
of
the
colored
soldiers
of
the
tenth
cavalry
i
next
heard
him
say
to
some
one
in
the
brush

then
he
sang
out

general
penrose
i
asked
i
dunno
said
the
darkey
we
got
lost
and
we
been
a
eber
since
by
this
time
two
other
negroes
had
emerged
from
their
place
of
concealment
they
had
deserted
penrose
command
which
was
out
of
rations
and
nearly
in
a
starving
condition
and
were
trying
to
make
their
way
back
to
fort
lyon
general
carr
concluded
from
what
they
could
tell
him
that
general
penrose
was
somewhere
on
polladora
creek
but
we
could
not
learn
anything
definite
from
the
starved
mokes
for
they
knew
not
where
they
were
themselves
having
learned
that
general
penrose
troops
were
in
such
bad
shape
general
carr
ordered
major
brown
to
start
out
the
next
morning
with
two
companies
of
cavalry
and
fifty
loaded
with
provisions
and
to
make
all
possible
speed
to
reach
and
relieve
the
suffering
soldiers
i
accompanied
this
detachment
and
on
the
third
day
out
we
found
the
soldiers
camped
on
the
polladora
the
camp
presented
a
pitiful
sight
indeed
for
over
two
weeks
the
men
had
had
only
quarter
rations
and
were
now
nearly
starved
to
death
over
two
hundred
horses
and
mules
were
lying
dead
having
died
from
fatigue
and
starvation
general
penrose
having
feared
that
general
carr
would
not
find
him
had
sent
back
a
company
of
the
seventh
cavalry
to
fort
lyon
for
supplies
but
no
word
as
yet
had
been
heard
from
them
the

a
welcome
visitor
about
the
first
man
i
saw
after
reaching
the
camp
was
my
old
true
and
tried
friend
wild
bill
that
night
we
had
a
jolly
reunion
around
the
general
carr
upon
arriving
with
his
force
took
command
of
all
the
troops
he
being
the
senior
officer
and
ranking
general
penrose
after
selecting
a
good
camp
he
unloaded
the
wagons
and
sent
them
back
to
fort
lyon
for
fresh
supplies
he
then
picked
out
five
hundred
of
the
best
men
and
horses
and
taking
his
with
him
he
started
south
for
the
canadian
river
distant
about
forty
miles
leaving
the
rest
of
the
troops
at
the
supply
camp
i
was
ordered
to
accompany
this
expedition
we
struck
the
south
fork
of
the
canadian
river
or
rio
colorado
at
a
point
a
few
miles
above
the
old
walls
which
at
one
time
had
composed
a
fort
and
was
the
place
where
kit
carson
once
had
a
big
indian
fight
we
were
now
within
twelve
miles
of
a
new
supply
dépôt
called
camp
evans
which
had
been
established
for
the
third
cavalry
and
evans
expedition
from
new
mexico
the
scouts
who
had
brought
in
this
information
also
reported
that
they
expected
the
arrival
at
camp
evans
of
a
from
new
mexico
with
a
large
quantity
of
beer
for
the
soldiers
this
news
was
pie
for
wild
bill
and
myself
and
we
determined
to
lie
low
for
that
beer
outfit
that
very
evening
it
came
along
and
the
beer
that
was
destined
for
the
soldiers
at
camp
evans
never
reached
its
destination
it
went
straight
down
the
thirsty
throats
of
general
carr
command
it
appears
that
the
mexicans
living
near
fort
union
had
manufactured
the
beer
and
were
taking
it
through
to
camp
evans
to
sell
to
the
troops
but
it
struck
a
lively
market
without
going
so
far
it
was
sold
to
our
boys
in
pint
cups
and
as
the
weather
was
very
cold
we
warmed
the
beer
by
putting
the
ends
of
our
heated
into
the
cups
the
result
was
one
of
the
biggest
beer
jollifications
i
ever
had
the
misfortune
to
attend
one
evening
general
carr
summoned
me
to
his
tent
and
said
he
wished
to
send
some
scouts
with
dispatches
to
camp
supply
which
were
to
be
forwarded
from
there
to
sheridan
he
ordered
me
to
call
the
scouts
together
at
once
at
his
headquarters
and
select
the
men
who
were
to
go
i
asked
him
if
i
should
not
go
myself
but
he
replied
that
he
wished
me
to
remain
with
the
command
as
he
could
not
spare
me
the
distance
to
camp
supply
was
about
two
hundred
miles
and
owing
to
the
very
cold
weather
it
was
anything
but
a
pleasant
trip
consequently
none
of
the
scouts
were
anxious
to
undertake
it
it
was
finally
settled
however
that
wild
bill
a
called
little
geary
and
three
other
scouts
should
carry
the
dispatches
and
they
accordingly
took
their
departure
next
day
with
instructions
to
return
to
the
command
as
soon
as
possible
for
several
days
we
scouted
along
the
canadian
river
but
found
no
signs
of
indians
general
carr
then
went
back
to
his
camp
and
soon
afterwards
our
wagon
train
came
in
from
fort
lyon
with
a
fresh
load
of
provisions
our
animals
being
in
poor
condition
we
remained
in
different
camps
along
san
francisco
creek
and
the
north
fork
of
the
canadian
until
wild
bill
and
his
scouts
returned
from
camp
supply
among
the
scouts
of
penrose
command
were
fifteen
mexicans
and
between
them
and
the
american
scouts
there
had
existed
a
feud
when
general
carr
took
command
of
the
expedition
uniting
it
with
his
own
and
i
was
made
chief
of
all
the
scouts
this
feud
grew
more
intense
and
the
mexicans
often
threatened
to
clean
us
out
but
they
postponed
the
undertaking
from
time
to
time
until
one
day
while
we
were
all
at
the
sutler
store
the
fight
took
place
and
resulted
in
the
mexicans
getting
severely
beaten
general
carr
upon
hearing
of
the
row
sent
for
wild
bill
and
myself
he
having
concluded
from
the
various
statements
which
had
been
made
to
him
that
we
were
the
instigators
of
the
affair
but
after
listening
to
what
we
had
to
say
he
thought
that
the
mexicans
were
as
much
to
blame
as
we
were
it
is
not
to
be
denied
that
wild
bill
and
myself
had
been
partaking
too
freely
of
tanglefoot
that
evening
and
general
carr
said
to
me
cody
there
are
plenty
of
antelopes
in
the
country
and
you
can
do
some
hunting
for
the
camp
while
we
stay
here
all
right
general
i
do
it
after
that
i
put
in
my
time
hunting
and
with
splendid
success
killing
from
fifteen
to
twenty
antelopes
a
day
which
kept
the
men
well
supplied
with
fresh
meat
at
length
our
horses
and
mules
having
become
sufficiently
recruited
to
travel
we
returned
to
fort
lyon
arriving
there
in
march
where
the
command
was
to
rest
and
recruit
for
thirty
days
before
proceeding
to
the
department
of
the
platte
whither
it
had
been
ordered
chapter
xx
an
exciting
chase
general
carr
at
my
request
kindly
granted
me
one
month
leave
of
absence
to
visit
my
family
in
louis
and
ordered
captain
hays
our
quartermaster
to
let
me
ride
my
mule
and
horse
to
sheridan
distant
miles
where
i
was
to
take
the
cars
i
was
instructed
to
leave
the
animals
in
the
quartermaster
corral
at
fort
wallace
until
i
should
come
back
but
instead
of
doing
this
i
put
them
both
in
the
care
of
my
old
friend
perry
the
at
sheridan
after
a
twenty
days
absence
in
louis
pleasantly
spent
with
my
family
i
returned
to
sheridan
and
there
learned
that
my
mule
and
horse
had
been
seized
by
the
government
it
seems
that
the
quartermaster
agent
at
sheridan
had
reported
to
general
bankhead
commanding
fort
wallace
and
to
captain
laufer
the
quartermaster
that
i
had
left
the
country
and
had
sold
a
government
horse
and
mule
to
perry
and
of
course
captain
laufer
took
possession
of
the
animals
and
threatened
to
have
perry
arrested
for
buying
government
property
perry
explained
to
him
the
facts
in
the
case
and
said
that
i
would
return
in
a
few
days
but
the
captain
would
pay
no
attention
to
his
statements
i
immediately
went
over
to
the
office
of
the
quartermaster
agent
and
had
perry
point
him
out
to
me
i
at
once
laid
hold
of
him
and
in
a
short
time
had
treated
him
to
just
such
a
thrashing
as
his
contemptible
lie
deserved
he
then
mounted
a
horse
rode
to
fort
wallace
and
reported
me
to
general
bankhead
and
captain
laufer
and
obtained
a
guard
to
return
with
and
protect
him
the
next
morning
i
secured
a
horse
from
perry
and
proceeding
to
fort
wallace
demanded
my
horse
and
mule
from
general
bankhead
on
the
ground
that
they
were
quartermaster
hays
property
and
belonged
to
general
carr
command
and
that
i
had
obtained
permission
to
ride
them
to
sheridan
and
back
general
bankhead
in
a
gruff
manner
ordered
me
out
of
his
office
and
off
the
reservation
saying
that
if
i
did
take
a
hurried
departure
he
would
have
me
forcibly
put
out
i
told
him
to
do
it
and
be
hanged
i
might
have
used
a
stronger
expression
and
upon
second
thought
i
believe
i
did
i
next
interviewed
captain
laufer
and
demanded
of
him
also
the
horse
and
mule
as
i
was
responsible
for
them
to
quartermaster
hays
captain
laufer
intimated
that
i
was
a
liar
and
that
i
had
disposed
of
the
animals
hot
words
ensued
between
us
and
he
too
ordered
me
to
leave
the
post
i
replied
that
general
bankhead
had
commanded
me
to
do
the
same
thing
but
that
i
had
not
yet
gone
and
that
i
did
not
propose
to
obey
any
orders
of
an
inferior
officer
seeing
that
it
was
of
no
use
to
make
any
further
effort
to
get
possession
of
the
animals
i
rode
back
to
sheridan
and
just
as
i
reached
there
i
met
the
quartermaster
agent
coming
out
from
supper
with
his
head
tied
up
it
occurred
to
me
that
he
had
not
received
more
than
one
half
the
punishment
justly
due
him
and
that
now
would
be
a
good
time
to
give
him
the
balance
so
i
carried
the
idea
into
immediate
execution
after
finishing
the
job
in
good
style
i
informed
him
that
he
could
not
stay
in
that
town
while
i
remained
there
and
convinced
him
that
sheridan
was
not
large
enough
to
hold
us
both
at
the
same
time
he
accordingly
left
the
place
and
again
went
to
fort
wallace
this
time
reporting
to
general
bankhead
that
i
had
driven
him
away
and
had
threatened
to
kill
him
that
night
while
sleeping
at
the
perry
house
i
was
awakened
by
a
tap
on
the
shoulder
and
upon
looking
up
i
was
considerably
surprised
to
see
the
room
filled
with
armed
negroes
who
had
their
guns
all
pointed
at
me
the
first
words
i
heard
came
from
the
sergeant
who
said
now
look
massa
bill
ef
you
makes
a
move
we
blow
you
off
de
farm
shuah
just
then
captain
ezekiel
entered
and
ordered
the
soldiers
to
stand
back
captain
what
does
this
mean
i
asked
i
am
sorry
bill
but
i
have
been
ordered
by
general
bankhead
to
arrest
you
and
bring
you
to
fort
wallace
said
he
that
all
right
said
i
but
you
could
have
made
the
arrest
alone
without
having
brought
the
whole
infantry
with
you
i
know
that
bill
replied
the
captain
but
as
you
not
been
in
very
good
humor
for
the
last
day
or
two
i
did
know
how
you
would
act
i
hastily
dressed
and
accompanied
captain
ezekiel
to
fort
wallace
arriving
there
at
two
in
the
morning
bill
i
am
really
sorry
said
captain
ezekiel
as
we
alighted
but
i
have
orders
to
place
you
in
the
and
i
must
perform
my
duty
very
well
captain
i
do
blame
you
a
bit
said
i
and
into
the
i
went
as
a
prisoner
for
the
first
and
only
time
in
my
life
the
sergeant
of
the
guard
who
was
an
old
friend
of
mine
belonging
to
captain
graham
company
which
was
stationed
there
at
the
time
did
not
put
me
into
a
cell
but
kindly
allowed
me
to
stay
in
his
room
and
occupy
his
bed
and
in
a
few
minutes
i
was
snoring
away
as
if
nothing
unusual
had
occurred
shortly
after
captain
graham
called
to
see
me
he
thought
it
was
a
shame
for
me
to
be
in
the
and
said
that
he
would
interview
general
bankhead
in
my
behalf
as
soon
as
he
got
up
the
captain
had
a
nice
breakfast
prepared
for
me
and
then
departed
at
i
was
not
sent
for
contrary
to
my
expectations
and
thereupon
i
had
word
conveyed
to
captain
graham
who
was
officer
of
the
day
that
i
wanted
to
see
general
bankhead
the
captain
informed
me
that
the
general
absolutely
refused
to
hold
any
conversation
whatever
with
me
at
this
time
there
was
no
telegraph
line
between
fort
wallace
and
fort
lyon
and
therefore
it
was
impossible
for
me
to
telegraph
to
general
carr
and
i
determined
to
send
a
dispatch
direct
to
general
sheridan
i
accordingly
wrote
out
a
long
telegram
informing
him
of
my
difficulty
and
had
it
taken
to
the
telegraph
office
for
transmission
but
the
operator
instead
of
sending
it
at
once
as
he
should
have
done
showed
it
to
general
bankhead
who
tore
it
up
and
instructed
the
operator
not
to
pay
any
attention
to
what
i
might
say
as
he
was
running
that
post
thinking
it
very
strange
that
i
received
no
answer
during
the
day
i
went
to
the
telegraph
office
accompanied
by
a
guard
and
learned
from
the
operator
what
he
had
done
see
here
my
young
friend
said
i
this
is
a
public
telegraph
line
and
i
want
my
telegram
sent
or
there
be
trouble
i
my
dispatch
and
handed
it
to
him
accompanied
with
the
money
to
pay
for
the
transmission
saying
as
i
did
so
young
man
i
wish
that
telegram
sent
direct
to
chicago
you
know
it
is
your
duty
to
send
it
and
it
must
go
he
knew
very
well
that
he
was
compelled
to
transmit
the
message
but
before
doing
so
he
called
on
general
bankhead
and
informed
him
of
what
i
had
said
and
told
him
that
he
would
certainly
have
to
send
it
for
if
he
did
he
might
lose
his
position
the
general
seeing
that
the
telegram
would
have
to
go
summoned
me
to
his
headquarters
and
the
first
thing
he
said
after
i
got
into
his
presence
was
if
i
let
you
go
sir
will
you
leave
the
post
at
once
and
not
bother
my
agent
at
sheridan
again
no
sir
i
replied
i
do
nothing
of
the
kind
i
remain
in
the
until
i
receive
an
answer
from
general
sheridan
if
i
give
you
the
horse
and
mule
will
you
proceed
at
once
to
fort
lyon
no
sir
i
have
some
bills
to
settle
at
sheridan
and
some
other
business
to
transact
replied
i
well
sir
will
you
at
least
agree
not
to
interfere
any
further
with
the
quartermaster
agent
at
sheridan
i
shall
not
bother
him
any
more
sir
as
i
have
had
all
i
want
from
him
was
my
answer
general
bankhead
thereupon
sent
for
captain
laufer
and
ordered
him
to
turn
the
horse
and
mule
over
to
me
in
a
few
minutes
more
i
was
on
my
way
to
sheridan
and
after
settling
my
business
there
i
proceeded
to
fort
lyon
arriving
two
days
afterwards
i
related
my
adventures
to
general
carr
major
brown
and
other
officers
who
were
greatly
amused
thereby
i
glad
you
come
bill
said
general
carr
as
i
have
been
wanting
you
for
the
last
two
weeks
while
we
have
been
at
this
post
several
valuable
animals
as
well
as
a
large
number
of
government
horses
and
mules
have
been
stolen
and
we
think
that
the
thieves
are
still
in
the
vicinity
of
the
fort
but
as
yet
we
have
been
unable
to
discover
their
rendezvous
i
have
had
a
party
out
for
the
last
few
days
in
the
neighborhood
of
old
fort
lyon
and
they
have
found
fresh
tracks
down
there
and
seem
to
think
that
the
stock
is
concealed
somewhere
in
the
timber
along
the
arkansas
river
bill
green
one
of
the
scouts
who
has
just
come
up
from
there
can
perhaps
tell
you
something
more
about
the
matter
green
who
had
been
summoned
said
that
he
had
discovered
fresh
trails
before
striking
the
heavy
timber
opposite
old
fort
lyon
but
that
in
the
tall
grass
he
could
not
follow
them
he
had
marked
the
place
where
he
had
last
seen
fresh
mule
tracks
so
that
he
could
find
it
again
now
cody
you
just
the
person
we
want
said
the
general
very
well
i
get
a
fresh
mount
and
i
go
down
and
see
what
i
can
discover
said
i
you
had
better
take
two
men
besides
green
and
a
pack
mule
with
eight
or
ten
days
rations
suggested
the
general
so
that
if
you
find
the
trail
you
can
follow
it
up
as
i
am
very
anxious
to
get
back
this
stolen
property
the
scoundrels
have
taken
one
of
my
private
horses
and
also
lieutenant
forbush
favorite
little
black
race
mule
next
morning
i
started
out
after
the
being
accompanied
by
green
jack
farley
and
another
scout
the
mule
track
marked
by
green
was
easily
found
and
with
very
little
difficulty
i
followed
it
for
about
two
miles
into
the
timber
and
came
upon
a
place
where
as
i
could
plainly
see
from
numerous
signs
quite
a
number
of
head
of
stock
had
been
tied
among
the
trees
and
kept
for
several
days
this
was
evidently
the
spot
where
the
thieves
had
been
hiding
their
stolen
stock
until
they
had
accumulated
quite
a
herd
from
this
point
it
was
difficult
to
trail
them
as
they
had
taken
the
stolen
animals
out
of
the
timber
one
by
one
and
in
different
directions
thus
showing
that
they
were
experts
at
the
business
and
experienced
frontiersmen
for
no
indian
could
have
exhibited
more
cunning
in
covering
up
a
trail
than
did
they
i
abandoned
the
idea
of
following
their
trail
in
this
immediate
locality
so
calling
my
men
together
i
told
them
that
we
would
ride
out
for
about
five
miles
and
make
a
complete
circuit
about
the
place
and
in
this
way
we
would
certainly
find
the
trail
on
which
they
had
moved
out
while
making
the
circuit
we
discovered
the
tracks
of
twelve
animals
four
mules
and
eight
horses
in
the
edge
of
some
and
from
this
point
we
had
no
trouble
in
trailing
them
down
the
arkansas
river
which
they
had
crossed
at
sand
creek
and
then
had
gone
up
the
latter
stream
in
the
direction
of
denver
to
which
place
they
were
undoubtedly
bound
when
nearing
denver
their
trail
became
so
obscure
that
we
at
last
lost
it
but
by
inquiring
of
the
settlers
along
the
road
which
they
had
taken
we
occasionally
heard
of
them
when
within
four
miles
of
denver
this
was
on
a
thursday
we
learned
that
the
had
passed
there
two
days
before
i
came
to
the
conclusion
they
would
attempt
to
dispose
of
the
animals
in
denver
and
being
aware
that
saturday
was
the
great
auction
day
there
i
thought
it
best
to
remain
where
we
were
at
a
hotel
and
not
go
into
the
city
until
that
day
it
certainly
would
not
have
been
advisable
for
me
to
have
gone
into
denver
meantime
because
i
was
there
and
if
the
thieves
had
learned
of
my
presence
in
the
city
they
would
at
once
have
suspected
my
business
early
saturday
morning
we
rode
into
town
and
stabled
our
horses
at
the
elephant
corral
i
secured
a
room
from
ed
chase
overlooking
the
corral
and
then
took
up
my
post
of
observation
i
did
not
have
long
to
wait
for
a
man
whom
i
readily
recognized
as
one
of
our
old
packers
rode
into
the
corral
mounted
upon
lieutenant
forbush
racing
mule
and
leading
another
government
mule
which
i
also
identified
it
had
been
recently
branded
and
over
the
was
a
plain
i
waited
for
the
man
companion
to
put
in
an
appearance
but
he
did
not
come
and
my
conclusion
was
that
he
was
secreted
outside
of
the
city
with
the
rest
of
the
animals
presently
the
black
mule
belonging
to
forbush
was
put
up
at
auction
now
thought
i
is
the
time
to
do
my
work
so
walking
through
the
crowd
who
were
bidding
for
the
mule
i
approached
the
man
who
had
offered
him
for
sale
he
recognized
me
and
endeavored
to
escape
but
i
seized
him
by
the
shoulder
saying
i
guess
my
friend
that
you
have
to
go
with
me
if
you
make
any
resistance
i
shoot
you
on
the
spot
he
was
armed
with
a
pair
of
pistols
which
i
took
away
from
him
then
informing
the
auctioneer
that
i
was
a
united
states
detective
and
showing
him
as
well
as
an
inquisitive
officer
my
commission
as
such
i
told
him
to
stop
the
sale
as
the
mule
was
stolen
property
and
that
i
had
arrested
the
thief
whose
name
was
williams
farley
and
green
who
were
near
at
hand
now
came
forward
and
together
we
took
the
prisoner
and
the
mules
three
miles
down
the
platte
river
there
in
a
thick
bunch
of
timber
we
all
dismounted
and
made
preparations
to
hang
williams
from
a
limb
if
he
did
not
tell
us
where
his
partner
was
at
first
he
denied
knowing
anything
about
any
partner
or
any
other
stock
but
when
he
saw
that
we
were
in
earnest
and
would
hang
him
at
the
end
of
the
given
time
five
minutes
unless
he
squealed
he
told
us
that
his
pal
was
at
an
unoccupied
house
three
miles
further
down
the
river
we
immediately
proceeded
to
the
spot
indicated
and
as
we
came
within
sight
of
the
house
we
saw
our
stock
grazing
near
by
just
as
we
rode
up
to
the
door
another
one
of
our
old
packers
whom
i
recognized
as
bill
bevins
stepped
to
the
front
and
i
covered
him
instantly
with
my
rifle
before
he
could
draw
his
revolver
i
ordered
him
to
throw
up
his
hands
and
he
obeyed
the
command
green
then
disarmed
him
and
brought
him
out
we
looked
through
the
house
and
found
their
saddles
blankets
overcoats
lariats
and
two
henry
rifles
which
we
took
possession
of
the
horses
and
mules
we
tied
in
a
bunch
and
with
the
whole
outfit
we
returned
to
denver
where
we
lodged
williams
and
bevins
in
jail
in
charge
of
my
friend
sheriff
edward
cook
the
next
day
we
took
them
out
and
tying
each
one
on
a
mule
we
struck
out
on
our
return
trip
to
fort
lyon
at
the
hotel
outside
the
city
where
we
had
stopped
on
thursday
and
friday
we
were
joined
by
our
man
with
the
that
night
we
camped
on
cherry
creek
seventeen
miles
from
denver
the
weather
it
being
in
april
was
cold
and
stormy
but
we
found
a
warm
and
cosy
camping
place
in
a
bend
of
the
creek
we
made
our
beds
in
a
row
with
our
feet
towards
the
fire
the
prisoners
so
far
had
appeared
very
docile
and
had
made
no
attempt
to
escape
and
therefore
i
did
not
think
it
necessary
to
hobble
them
we
made
them
sleep
on
the
inside
and
it
was
so
arranged
that
some
one
of
us
should
be
on
guard
all
the
time
at
about
one
in
the
night
it
began
snowing
while
i
was
watching
shortly
before
three
jack
farley
who
was
then
on
guard
and
sitting
on
the
foot
of
the
bed
with
his
back
to
the
prisoners
was
kicked
clear
into
the
fire
by
williams
and
the
next
moment
bevins
who
had
got
hold
of
his
shoes
which
i
had
thought
were
out
of
his
reach
sprang
up
and
jumped
over
the
fire
and
started
on
a
run
i
sent
a
shot
after
him
as
soon
as
i
awoke
sufficiently
to
comprehend
what
was
taking
place
williams
attempted
to
follow
him
and
as
he
did
so
i
whirled
around
and
knocked
him
down
with
my
revolver
farley
by
this
time
had
gathered
himself
out
of
the
fire
and
green
had
started
after
bevins
firing
at
him
on
the
run
but
the
prisoner
made
his
escape
into
the
brush
in
his
flight
unfortunately
for
him
and
luckily
for
us
he
dropped
one
of
his
shoes
leaving
williams
in
the
charge
of
farley
and
long
doc
as
we
called
the
man
with
the
green
and
myself
struck
out
after
bevins
as
fast
as
possible
we
heard
him
breaking
through
the
brush
but
knowing
that
it
would
be
useless
to
follow
him
on
foot
we
went
back
to
the
camp
and
saddled
up
two
of
the
fastest
horses
and
at
daylight
we
struck
out
on
his
trail
which
was
plainly
visible
in
the
snow
he
had
got
an
hour
and
a
half
the
start
of
us
his
tracks
led
us
in
the
direction
of
the
mountains
and
the
south
platte
river
and
as
the
country
through
which
he
was
passing
was
covered
with
prickly
pears
we
knew
that
he
could
not
escape
stepping
on
them
with
his
one
bare
foot
and
hence
we
were
likely
to
overtake
him
in
a
short
time
we
could
see
however
from
the
long
jumps
that
he
was
taking
that
he
was
making
excellent
time
but
we
frequently
noticed
after
we
had
gone
some
distance
that
the
prickly
pears
and
stones
along
his
route
were
cutting
his
bare
foot
as
nearly
every
track
of
it
was
spotted
with
blood
we
had
run
our
horses
some
twelve
miles
when
we
saw
bevins
crossing
a
ridge
about
two
miles
ahead
urging
our
horses
up
to
their
utmost
speed
we
reached
the
ridge
just
as
he
was
descending
the
divide
towards
the
south
platte
which
stream
was
very
deep
and
swift
at
this
point
it
became
evident
that
if
he
should
cross
it
ahead
of
us
he
would
have
a
good
chance
of
making
his
escape
so
pushing
our
steeds
as
fast
as
possible
we
rapidly
gained
on
him
and
when
within
a
hundred
yards
of
him
i
cried
to
him
to
halt
or
i
would
shoot
knowing
i
was
a
good
shot
he
stopped
and
coolly
sitting
down
waited
till
we
came
up
bevins
you
given
us
a
good
run
said
i
yes
said
he
and
if
i
had
had
fifteen
minutes
more
of
a
start
and
got
across
the
platte
i
would
have
laughed
at
the
idea
of
your
ever
catching
me
bevin
run
was
the
most
remarkable
feat
of
the
kind
ever
known
either
of
a
white
man
or
an
indian
a
man
who
could
run
in
the
snow
eighteen
miles
through
a
prickly
pear
patch
was
certainly
a
tough
one
and
that
the
kind
of
a
person
bill
bevins
was
upon
looking
at
his
bleeding
foot
i
really
felt
sorry
for
him
he
asked
me
for
my
knife
and
i
gave
him
my
bowie
with
which
he
dug
the
prickly
pear
briars
out
of
his
foot
i
considered
him
as
game
a
man
as
i
had
ever
met
bevins
i
have
got
to
take
you
back
said
i
but
as
you
ca
walk
with
that
foot
you
can
ride
my
horse
and
i
foot
it
we
accordingly
started
back
for
our
camp
with
bevins
on
my
horse
which
was
led
either
by
green
or
myself
as
we
alternately
rode
the
other
horse
we
kept
a
close
watch
on
bevins
for
we
had
ample
proof
that
he
needed
watching
his
wounded
foot
must
have
pained
him
terribly
but
not
a
word
of
complaint
escaped
him
on
arriving
at
the
camp
we
found
williams
bound
as
we
had
left
him
and
he
seemed
sorry
that
we
had
captured
bevins
illustration
the
recapture
of
bevins
after
breakfasting
we
resumed
our
journey
and
nothing
worth
of
note
again
occurred
until
we
reached
the
arkansas
river
where
we
found
a
vacant
cabin
and
at
once
took
possession
of
it
for
the
night
there
was
no
likelihood
of
bevins
again
trying
to
escape
for
his
foot
had
swollen
to
an
enormous
size
and
was
useless
believing
that
williams
could
not
escape
from
the
cabin
we
unbound
him
we
then
went
to
sleep
leaving
long
doc
on
guard
the
cabin
being
comfortably
warmed
and
well
lighted
by
the
fire
it
was
a
dark
stormy
night
so
dark
that
you
could
hardly
see
your
hand
before
you
at
about
ten
williams
asked
long
doc
to
allow
him
to
step
to
the
door
for
a
moment
long
doc
who
had
his
revolver
in
his
hand
did
not
think
it
necessary
to
wake
us
up
and
believing
that
he
could
take
care
of
the
prisoner
he
granted
his
request
williams
thereupon
walked
to
the
outer
edge
of
the
door
while
long
doc
revolver
in
hand
was
watching
him
from
the
inside
suddenly
williams
made
a
spring
to
the
right
and
before
doc
could
even
raise
his
revolver
he
had
dodged
around
the
house
doc
jumped
after
him
and
fired
just
as
he
turned
a
corner
the
report
bringing
us
all
to
our
feet
and
in
an
instant
we
knew
what
had
happened
i
at
once
covered
bevins
with
my
revolver
but
as
i
saw
that
he
could
hardly
stir
and
was
making
no
demonstration
i
lowered
the
weapon
just
then
doc
came
in
swearing
a
blue
streak
and
announced
that
williams
had
escaped
there
was
nothing
for
us
to
do
except
to
gather
our
horses
close
to
the
cabin
and
stand
guard
over
them
for
the
rest
of
the
night
to
prevent
the
possibility
of
williams
sneaking
up
and
stealing
one
of
them
that
was
the
last
i
ever
saw
or
heard
of
williams
we
finally
got
back
to
fort
lyon
with
bevins
and
general
carr
to
whom
i
immediately
reported
complimented
us
highly
on
the
success
of
our
trip
notwithstanding
we
had
lost
one
prisoner
the
next
day
we
took
bevins
to
boggs
ranch
on
picket
wire
creek
and
there
turned
him
over
to
the
civil
authorities
who
put
him
in
a
log
jail
to
await
his
trial
he
never
was
tried
however
for
he
soon
made
his
escape
as
i
expected
he
would
do
i
heard
no
more
of
him
until
when
i
learned
that
he
was
skirmishing
around
on
laramie
plains
at
his
old
tricks
he
sent
word
by
the
gentleman
from
whom
i
gained
this
information
that
if
he
ever
met
me
again
he
would
kill
me
on
sight
he
finally
was
arrested
and
convicted
for
robbery
and
was
confined
in
the
prison
at
laramie
city
again
he
made
his
escape
and
soon
afterwards
he
organized
a
desperate
gang
of
outlaws
who
infested
the
country
north
of
the
union
pacific
railroad
and
when
the
stages
began
to
run
between
cheyenne
and
deadwood
in
the
black
hills
they
robbed
the
coaches
and
passengers
frequently
making
large
hauls
of
plunder
they
kept
this
up
for
some
time
till
finally
most
of
the
gang
were
caught
tried
convicted
and
sent
to
the
penitentiary
for
a
number
of
years
bill
bevins
and
nearly
all
of
his
gang
are
now
confined
in
the
nebraska
state
prison
to
which
they
were
transferred

a
military
expedition
a
day
or
two
after
my
return
to
fort
lyon
the
fifth
cavalry
were
ordered
to
the
department
of
the
platte
and
took
up
their
line
of
march
for
fort
mcpherson
nebraska
we
laid
over
one
day
at
fort
wallace
to
get
supplies
and
while
there
i
had
occasion
to
pass
general
headquarters
his
orderly
called
to
me
and
said
the
general
wished
to
see
me
as
i
entered
the
general
office
he
extended
his
hand
and
said
i
hope
you
have
no
hard
feelings
toward
me
cody
for
having
you
arrested
when
you
were
here
i
have
just
had
a
talk
with
general
carr
and
quartermaster
hays
and
they
informed
me
that
you
had
their
permission
to
ride
the
horse
and
mule
and
if
you
had
stated
this
fact
to
me
there
would
have
been
no
trouble
about
the
matter
whatever
that
is
all
right
general
said
i
i
will
think
no
more
of
it
but
i
do
believe
that
your
quartermaster
agent
will
ever
again
circulate
false
stories
about
me
no
said
the
general
he
has
not
yet
recovered
from
the
beating
that
you
gave
him
from
fort
wallace
we
moved
down
to
sheridan
where
the
command
halted
for
us
to
lay
in
a
supply
of
forage
which
was
stored
there
i
was
still
messing
with
major
brown
with
whom
i
went
into
the
village
to
purchase
a
supply
of
provisions
for
our
mess
but
unfortunately
we
were
in
too
jolly
a
mood
to
fool
away
money
on
grub
we
bought
several
articles
however
and
put
them
into
the
ambulance
and
sent
them
back
to
the
camp
with
our
cook
the
major
and
myself
did
not
return
until
next
morning
soon
afterwards
the
general
sounded
boots
and
saddles
and
presently
the
regiment
was
on
its
way
to
mcpherson
it
was
very
late
before
we
went
into
camp
that
night
and
we
were
tired
and
hungry
just
as
major
brown
was
having
his
tent
put
up
his
cook
came
to
us
and
asked
where
the
provisions
were
that
we
had
bought
the
day
before
why
did
we
not
give
them
to
you
did
you
not
bring
them
to
camp
in
the
ambulance
asked
major
brown
no
sir
it
was
only
a
demijohn
of
whiskey
a
demijohn
of
brandy
and
two
cases
of
old
gin
said
the
cook
the
mischief
i
exclaimed
did
we
spend
any
money
on
grub
at
all
no
sir
replied
the
cook
well
that
will
do
for
the
present
said
major
brown
it
seems
that
our
minds
had
evidently
been
running
on
a
different
subject
than
provisions
while
we
were
loitering
in
sheridan
and
we
found
ourselves
with
a
two
hundred
and
fifty
mile
march
ahead
of
us
without
anything
more
inviting
than
ordinary
army
rations
at
this
juncture
captain
denny
came
up
and
the
major
apologized
for
not
being
able
to
invite
him
to
take
supper
with
us
but
we
did
the
next
best
thing
and
asked
him
to
take
a
drink
he
remarked
that
that
was
what
he
was
looking
for
and
when
he
learned
of
our
being
out
of
commissary
supplies
and
that
we
had
bought
nothing
except
whiskey
brandy
and
gin
he
said
joyously
boys
as
we
have
an
abundance
you
can
eat
with
us
and
we
will
drink
with
you
it
was
a
satisfactory
arrangement
and
from
that
time
forward
we
traded
our
liquids
for
their
solids
when
the
rest
of
the
officers
heard
of
what
brown
and
i
had
done
they
all
sent
us
invitations
to
dine
with
them
at
any
time
we
returned
the
compliment
by
inviting
them
to
drink
with
us
whenever
they
were
dry
although
i
would
not
advise
anybody
to
follow
our
example
yet
it
is
a
fact
that
we
got
more
provisions
for
our
whiskey
than
the
same
money
which
we
paid
for
the
liquor
would
have
bought
so
after
all
it
proved
a
very
profitable
investment
on
reaching
the
north
fork
of
the
beaver
and
riding
down
the
valley
towards
the
stream
i
suddenly
discovered
a
large
fresh
indian
trail
on
examination
i
found
it
to
be
scattered
all
over
the
valley
on
both
sides
of
the
creek
as
if
a
very
large
village
had
recently
passed
down
that
way
judging
from
the
size
of
the
trail
i
thought
there
could
not
be
less
than
four
hundred
lodges
or
between
hundred
and
three
thousand
warriors
women
and
children
in
the
band
i
galloped
hack
to
the
command
distant
about
three
miles
and
reported
the
news
to
general
carr
who
halted
the
regiment
and
after
consulting
a
few
minutes
ordered
me
to
select
a
ravine
or
as
low
ground
as
possible
so
that
he
could
keep
the
troops
out
of
sight
until
we
could
strike
the
creek
we
went
into
camp
on
the
beaver
and
the
general
ordered
lieutenant
ward
to
take
twelve
men
and
myself
and
follow
up
the
trail
for
several
miles
and
find
out
how
fast
the
indians
were
traveling
i
was
soon
convinced
by
the
many
camps
they
had
made
that
they
were
traveling
slowly
and
hunting
as
they
journeyed
we
went
down
the
beaver
on
this
scout
about
twelve
miles
keeping
our
horses
well
concealed
under
the
banks
of
the
creek
so
as
not
to
be
discovered
at
this
point
lieutenant
ward
and
myself
leaving
our
horses
behind
us
crawled
to
the
top
of
a
high
knoll
where
we
could
have
a
good
view
for
some
miles
distant
down
the
stream
we
peeped
over
the
summit
of
the
hill
and
not
over
three
miles
away
we
could
see
a
whole
indian
village
in
plain
sight
and
thousands
of
ponies
grazing
around
on
the
prairie
looking
over
to
our
left
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
creek
we
observed
two
or
three
parties
of
indians
coming
in
loaded
down
with
buffalo
meat
this
is
no
place
for
us
lieutenant
said
i
i
think
we
have
important
business
at
the
camp
to
attend
to
as
soon
as
possible
i
agree
with
you
said
he
and
the
quicker
we
get
there
the
better
it
will
be
for
us
we
quickly
descended
the
hill
and
joined
the
men
below
lieutenant
ward
hurriedly
wrote
a
note
to
general
carr
and
handing
it
to
a
corporal
ordered
him
to
make
all
possible
haste
back
to
the
command
and
deliver
the
message
the
man
started
off
on
a
gallop
and
lieutenant
ward
said
we
will
march
slowly
back
until
we
meet
the
troops
as
i
think
the
general
will
soon
be
here
for
he
will
start
immediately
upon
receiving
my
note
in
a
few
minutes
we
heard
two
or
three
shots
in
the
direction
in
which
our
dispatch
courier
had
gone
and
soon
after
we
saw
him
come
flying
around
the
bend
of
the
creek
pursued
by
four
or
five
indians
the
lieutenant
with
his
squad
of
soldiers
and
myself
at
once
charged
upon
them
when
they
turned
and
ran
across
the
stream
this
will
not
do
said
lieutenant
ward
the
whole
indian
village
will
now
know
that
soldiers
are
near
by
lieutenant
give
me
that
note
and
i
will
take
it
to
the
general
said
i
he
gladly
handed
me
the
dispatch
and
spurring
my
horse
i
dashed
up
the
creek
after
having
ridden
a
short
distance
i
observed
another
party
of
indians
also
going
to
the
village
with
meat
but
instead
of
waiting
for
them
to
fire
upon
me
i
gave
them
a
shot
at
long
range
seeing
one
man
firing
at
them
so
boldly
it
surprised
them
and
they
did
not
know
what
to
make
of
it
while
they
were
thus
considering
i
got
between
them
and
our
camp
by
this
time
they
had
recovered
from
their
surprise
and
cutting
their
buffalo
meat
loose
from
their
horses
they
came
after
me
at
the
top
of
their
speed
but
as
their
steeds
were
tired
out
it
did
not
take
me
long
to
leave
them
far
in
the
rear
i
reached
the
command
in
less
than
an
hour
delivered
the
dispatch
to
general
carr
and
informed
him
of
what
i
had
seen
he
instantly
had
the
bugler
sound
boots
and
saddles
and
all
the
troops
with
the
exception
of
two
companies
which
we
left
to
guard
the
train
were
soon
galloping
in
the
direction
of
the
indian
camp
we
had
ridden
about
three
miles
when
we
met
lieutenant
ward
who
was
coming
slowly
towards
us
he
reported
that
he
had
run
into
a
party
of
indian
and
had
killed
one
of
the
number
and
had
had
one
of
his
horses
wounded
we
immediately
pushed
forward
and
after
marching
about
five
miles
came
within
sight
of
hundreds
of
mounted
indians
advancing
up
the
creek
to
meet
us
they
formed
a
complete
line
in
front
of
us
general
carr
being
desirous
of
striking
their
village
ordered
the
troops
to
charge
break
through
their
line
and
keep
straight
on
this
movement
would
no
doubt
have
been
successfully
accomplished
had
it
not
been
for
the
and
french
lieutenant
schinosky
commanding
company
b
who
misunderstanding
general
carr
orders
charged
upon
some
indians
at
the
left
while
the
rest
of
the
command
dashed
through
the
enemy
line
and
was
keeping
straight
on
when
it
was
observed
that
schinosky
and
his
company
were
surrounded
by
four
or
five
hundred
the
general
to
save
the
company
was
obliged
to
sound
a
halt
and
charge
back
to
the
rescue
the
company
during
this
short
fight
had
several
men
and
quite
a
number
of
horses
killed
all
this
took
up
valuable
time
and
night
was
coming
on
the
indians
were
fighting
desperately
to
keep
us
from
reaching
their
village
which
being
informed
by
couriers
of
what
was
taking
place
was
packing
up
and
getting
away
during
that
afternoon
it
was
all
we
could
do
to
hold
our
own
in
fighting
the
mounted
warriors
who
were
in
our
front
and
contesting
every
inch
of
the
ground
the
general
had
left
word
for
our
wagon
train
to
follow
up
with
its
escort
of
two
companies
but
as
it
had
not
made
its
appearance
he
entertained
some
fears
that
it
had
been
surrounded
and
to
prevent
the
possible
loss
of
the
supply
train
we
had
to
go
back
and
look
for
it
about
that
evening
we
found
it
and
went
into
camp
for
the
night
next
morning
we
passed
down
the
creek
and
there
was
not
an
indian
to
be
seen
they
had
all
disappeared
and
gone
on
with
their
village
two
miles
further
on
we
came
to
where
a
village
had
been
located
and
here
we
found
nearly
everything
belonging
or
pertaining
to
an
indian
camp
which
had
been
left
in
the
great
hurry
to
get
away
these
articles
were
all
gathered
up
and
burned
we
then
pushed
out
on
the
trail
as
fast
as
possible
it
led
us
to
the
northeast
towards
the
republican
but
as
the
indians
had
a
night
the
start
of
us
we
entertained
but
little
hope
of
overtaking
them
that
day
upon
reaching
the
republican
in
the
afternoon
the
general
called
a
halt
and
as
the
trail
was
running
more
to
the
east
he
concluded
to
send
his
wagon
train
on
to
fort
mcpherson
by
the
most
direct
route
while
he
would
follow
on
the
trail
of
the
next
morning
at
daylight
we
again
pulled
out
and
were
evidently
gaining
rapidly
on
the
indians
for
we
could
occasionally
see
them
in
the
distance
about
that
day
while
major
babcock
was
ahead
of
the
main
command
with
his
company
and
while
we
were
crossing
a
deep
ravine
we
were
surprised
by
about
three
hundred
warriors
who
commenced
a
lively
fire
upon
us
galloping
out
of
the
ravine
on
to
the
rough
prairie
the
men
dismounted
and
returned
the
fire
we
soon
succeeded
in
driving
the
enemy
before
us
and
were
so
close
upon
them
at
one
time
that
they
abandoned
and
threw
away
nearly
all
their
lodges
and
camp
equipages
and
everything
that
had
any
considerable
weight
they
left
behind
them
their
horses
and
for
miles
we
could
see
indian
furniture
strewn
along
in
every
direction
the
trail
became
divided
and
the
indians
scattered
in
small
bodies
all
over
the
prairie
as
night
was
approaching
and
our
horses
were
about
giving
out
a
halt
was
called
a
company
was
detailed
to
collect
all
the
indian
horses
running
loose
over
the
country
and
to
burn
the
other
indian
property
the
command
being
nearly
out
of
rations
i
was
sent
to
the
nearest
point
old
fort
kearney
about
sixty
miles
distant
for
supplies
shortly
after
we
reached
fort
mcpherson
which
continued
to
be
the
headquarters
of
the
fifth
cavalry
for
some
time
we
remained
there
for
ten
days
fitting
out
for
a
new
expedition
to
the
republican
river
country
and
were
reinforced
by
three
companies
of
the
celebrated
pawnee
indian
scouts
commanded
by
major
frank
north
his
officers
being
captain
lute
north
brother
of
the
major
captain
cushing
his
captain
morse
and
lieutenants
beecher
matthews
and
kislandberry
general
carr
recommended
at
this
time
to
general
augur
who
was
in
command
of
the
department
that
i
be
made
chief
of
scouts
in
the
department
of
the
platte
and
informed
me
that
in
this
position
i
would
receive
higher
wages
than
i
had
been
getting
in
the
department
of
the
missouri
this
appointment
i
had
not
asked
for
i
made
the
acquaintance
of
major
frank
north
b
and
i
found
him
and
his
officers
perfect
gentlemen
and
we
were
all
good
friends
from
the
very
start
the
pawnee
scouts
had
made
quite
a
reputation
for
themselves
as
they
had
performed
brave
and
valuable
services
in
fighting
against
the
sioux
whose
bitter
enemies
they
were
being
thoroughly
acquainted
with
the
republican
and
beaver
country
i
was
glad
that
they
were
to
be
with
the
expedition
and
they
did
good
service
footnote
b
major
north
is
now
my
partner
in
a
cattle
ranch
in
nebraska
during
our
stay
at
fort
mcpherson
i
made
the
acquaintance
of
lieutenant
george
belden
known
as
the
white
chief
whose
life
was
written
by
colonel
brisbin
army
i
found
him
to
be
an
intelligent
dashing
fellow
a
splendid
rider
and
an
excellent
shot
an
hour
after
our
introduction
he
challenged
me
for
a
rifle
match
the
preliminaries
of
which
were
soon
arranged
we
were
to
shoot
ten
shots
each
for
fifty
dollars
at
two
hundred
yards
off
hand
belden
was
to
use
a
henry
rifle
while
i
was
to
shoot
my
old
lucretia
this
match
i
won
and
then
belden
proposed
to
shoot
a
one
hundred
yard
match
as
i
was
shooting
over
his
distance
in
this
match
belden
was
victorious
we
were
now
even
and
we
stopped
right
there
while
we
were
at
this
post
general
augur
and
several
of
his
officers
and
also
thomas
duncan
brevet
brigadier
and
lieutenant
colonel
of
the
fifth
cavalry
paid
us
a
visit
for
the
purpose
of
reviewing
the
command
the
regiment
turned
out
in
fine
style
and
showed
themselves
to
be
well
drilled
soldiers
thoroughly
understanding
military
tactics
the
pawnee
scouts
were
also
reviewed
and
it
was
very
amusing
to
see
them
in
their
full
regulation
uniform
they
had
been
furnished
a
regular
cavalry
uniform
and
on
this
parade
some
of
them
had
their
heavy
overcoats
on
others
their
large
black
hats
with
all
the
brass
accoutrements
attached
some
of
them
were
minus
pantaloons
and
only
wore
a
breech
clout
others
wore
regulation
pantaloons
but
no
shirts
on
and
were
bareheaded
others
again
had
the
seat
of
the
pantaloons
cut
out
leaving
only
leggins
some
of
them
wore
brass
spurs
but
had
no
boots
or
moccasins
on
they
seemed
to
understand
the
drill
remarkably
well
for
indians
the
commands
of
course
were
given
to
them
in
their
own
language
by
major
north
who
could
talk
it
as
well
as
any
pawnee
the
indians
were
well
mounted
and
felt
proud
and
elated
because
they
had
been
made
united
states
soldiers
major
north
has
had
for
years
complete
power
over
these
indians
and
can
do
more
with
them
than
any
man
living
that
evening
after
the
parade
was
over
the
officers
and
quite
a
number
of
ladies
visited
a
grand
indian
dance
given
by
the
pawnees
and
of
all
the
indians
i
have
seen
their
dances
excel
those
of
any
other
tribe
next
day
the
command
started
when
encamped
several
days
after
on
the
republican
river
near
the
mouth
of
the
beaver
we
heard
the
whoops
of
indians
followed
by
shots
in
the
vicinity
of
the
mule
herd
which
had
been
taken
down
to
water
one
of
the
herders
came
dashing
into
camp
with
an
arrow
sticking
into
him
my
horse
was
close
at
hand
and
mounting
him
i
at
once
dashed
off
after
the
mule
herd
which
had
been
stampeded
i
supposed
certainly
that
i
would
be
the
first
man
on
the
ground
i
was
mistaken
however
for
the
pawnee
indians
unlike
regular
soldiers
had
not
waited
to
receive
orders
from
their
officers
but
had
jumped
on
their
ponies
without
bridles
or
saddles
and
placing
ropes
in
their
mouths
had
dashed
off
in
the
direction
whence
the
shots
had
come
and
had
got
there
ahead
of
me
it
proved
to
be
a
party
of
about
fifty
sioux
who
had
endeavored
to
stampede
our
mules
and
it
took
them
by
surprise
to
see
their
inveterate
enemies
the
pawnees
coming
at
full
gallop
towards
them
they
were
not
aware
that
the
pawnees
were
with
the
command
and
as
they
knew
that
it
would
take
regular
soldiers
sometime
to
turn
out
they
thought
they
would
have
ample
opportunity
to
secure
the
herd
before
the
troops
could
give
chase
we
had
a
running
fight
of
fifteen
miles
and
several
of
the
enemy
were
killed
during
this
chase
i
was
mounted
on
an
excellent
horse
which
colonel
royal
had
picked
out
for
me
and
for
the
first
mile
or
two
i
was
in
advance
of
the
pawnees
presently
a
pawnee
shot
by
me
like
an
arrow
and
i
could
not
help
admiring
the
horse
that
he
was
riding
seeing
that
he
possessed
rare
running
qualities
i
determined
if
possible
to
get
possession
of
the
animal
in
some
way
it
was
a
large
buckskin
or
yellow
horse
and
i
took
a
careful
view
of
him
so
that
i
would
know
him
when
i
returned
to
camp
after
the
chase
was
over
i
rode
up
to
major
north
and
inquired
about
the
buckskin
horse
oh
yes
said
the
major
that
is
one
of
our
favorite
steeds
what
chance
is
there
to
trade
for
him
i
asked
it
is
a
government
horse
said
he
and
the
indian
who
is
riding
him
is
very
much
attached
to
the
animal
i
have
fallen
in
love
with
the
horse
myself
said
i
and
i
would
like
to
know
if
you
have
any
objections
to
my
trading
for
him
if
i
can
arrange
it
satisfactorily
with
the
indian
he
said
none
whatever
and
i
will
help
you
to
do
it
you
can
give
the
indian
another
horse
in
his
place
a
few
days
after
this
i
persuaded
the
indian
by
making
him
several
presents
to
trade
horses
with
me
and
in
this
way
i
became
the
owner
of
the
buckskin
steed
not
as
my
own
property
however
but
as
a
government
horse
that
i
could
ride
i
gave
him
the
name
of
buckskin
joe
and
he
proved
to
be
a
second
brigham
that
horse
i
rode
on
and
off
during
the
summers
of
and
and
he
was
the
horse
that
the
grand
duke
alexis
rode
on
his
buffalo
hunt
in
the
winter
of
after
i
had
left
fort
mcpherson
buckskin
joe
was
condemned
and
sold
at
public
sale
and
was
bought
by
dave
perry
at
north
platte
who
in
presented
him
to
me
and
i
still
own
him
he
is
now
at
my
ranch
on
the
dismal
river
stone
blind
but
i
shall
keep
him
until
he
dies
the
command
scouted
several
days
up
the
beaver
and
prairie
dog
rivers
occasionally
having
running
fights
with
war
parties
of
indians
but
did
not
succeed
in
getting
them
into
a
general
battle
at
the
end
of
twenty
days
we
found
ourselves
back
on
the
republican
hitherto
the
pawnees
had
not
taken
much
interest
in
me
but
while
at
this
camp
i
gained
their
respect
and
admiration
by
showing
them
how
i
killed
buffaloes
although
the
pawnees
were
excellent
buffalo
killers
for
indians
i
have
never
seen
one
of
them
who
could
kill
more
than
four
or
five
in
one
run
a
number
of
them
generally
surround
the
herd
and
then
dash
in
upon
them
and
in
this
way
each
one
kills
from
one
to
four
buffaloes
i
had
gone
out
in
company
with
major
north
and
some
of
the
officers
and
saw
them
make
a
surround
twenty
of
the
pawnees
circled
a
herd
and
succeeded
in
killing
only
while
they
were
cutting
up
the
animals
another
herd
appeared
in
sight
the
indians
were
preparing
to
surround
it
when
i
asked
major
north
to
keep
them
back
and
let
me
show
them
what
i
could
do
he
accordingly
informed
the
indians
of
my
wish
and
they
readily
consented
to
let
me
have
the
opportunity
i
had
learned
that
buckskin
joe
was
an
excellent
buffalo
horse
and
felt
confident
that
i
would
astonish
the
natives
galloping
in
among
the
buffaloes
i
certainly
did
so
by
killing
in
less
than
a
run
at
nearly
every
shot
i
killed
a
buffalo
stringing
the
dead
animals
out
on
the
prairie
not
over
fifty
feet
apart
this
manner
of
killing
was
greatly
admired
by
the
indians
who
called
me
a
big
chief
and
from
that
time
on
i
stood
high
in
their
estimation
chapter
xxii
a
desperate
fight
on
leaving
camp
the
command
took
a
westward
course
up
the
republican
and
major
north
with
two
companies
of
his
pawnees
and
two
or
three
companies
of
cavalry
under
the
command
of
colonel
royal
made
a
scout
to
the
north
of
the
river
shortly
after
we
had
gone
into
camp
on
the
black
tail
deer
fork
we
observed
a
band
of
indians
coming
over
the
prairie
at
full
gallop
singing
and
yelling
and
waving
their
lances
and
long
poles
at
first
we
supposed
them
to
be
sioux
and
all
was
excitement
for
a
few
moments
we
noticed
however
that
our
pawnee
indians
made
no
hostile
demonstrations
or
preparations
towards
going
out
to
fight
them
but
began
swinging
and
yelling
themselves
captain
lute
north
stepped
up
to
general
carr
and
said
general
those
are
our
men
who
are
coming
and
they
have
had
a
fight
that
is
the
way
they
act
when
they
come
back
from
a
battle
and
have
taken
any
scalps
the
pawnees
came
into
camp
on
the
run
captain
north
calling
to
one
of
them
a
sergeant
soon
found
out
that
they
had
run
across
a
party
of
sioux
who
were
following
a
large
indian
trail
these
indians
had
evidently
been
in
a
fight
for
two
or
three
of
them
had
been
wounded
and
they
were
conveying
the
injured
persons
on
the
pawnees
had
jumped
them
and
had
killed
three
or
four
more
of
them
next
morning
the
command
at
an
early
hour
started
out
to
take
up
this
indian
trail
which
they
followed
for
two
days
as
rapidly
as
possible
it
becoming
evident
from
the
many
camp
fires
which
we
passed
that
we
were
gaining
on
the
indians
wherever
they
had
encamped
we
found
the
print
of
a
woman
shoe
and
we
concluded
that
they
had
with
them
some
white
captive
this
made
us
all
the
more
anxious
to
overtake
them
and
general
carr
accordingly
selected
all
his
best
horses
which
could
stand
a
hard
run
and
gave
orders
for
the
wagon
train
to
follow
as
fast
as
possible
while
he
pushed
ahead
on
a
forced
march
at
the
same
time
i
was
ordered
to
pick
out
five
or
six
of
the
best
pawnees
and
go
on
in
advance
of
the
command
keeping
ten
or
twelve
miles
ahead
on
the
trail
so
that
when
we
overtook
the
indians
we
could
find
out
the
location
of
their
camp
and
send
word
to
the
troops
before
they
came
in
sight
thus
affording
ample
time
to
arrange
a
plan
for
the
capture
of
the
village
after
having
gone
about
ten
miles
in
advance
of
the
regiment
we
began
to
move
very
cautiously
as
we
were
now
evidently
nearing
the
indians
we
looked
carefully
over
the
summits
of
the
hills
before
exposing
ourselves
to
plain
view
and
at
last
we
discovered
the
village
encamped
in
the
south
of
the
south
platte
river
at
summit
springs
here
i
left
the
pawnee
scouts
to
keep
watch
while
i
went
back
and
informed
general
carr
that
the
indians
were
in
sight
the
general
at
once
ordered
his
men
to
tighten
their
saddles
and
otherwise
prepare
for
action
soon
all
was
excitement
among
the
officers
and
soldiers
every
one
being
anxious
to
charge
the
village
i
now
changed
my
horse
for
old
buckskin
joe
who
had
been
led
for
me
thus
far
and
was
comparatively
fresh
acting
on
my
suggestion
the
general
made
a
circuit
to
the
north
believing
that
if
the
indians
had
their
scouts
out
they
would
naturally
be
watching
in
the
direction
whence
they
had
come
when
we
had
passed
the
indians
and
were
between
them
and
the
platte
river
we
turned
to
the
left
and
started
toward
the
village
by
this
manoeuver
we
had
avoided
discovery
by
the
sioux
scouts
and
we
were
confident
of
giving
them
a
complete
surprise
keeping
the
command
wholly
out
of
sight
until
we
were
within
a
mile
of
the
indians
the
general
halted
the
advance
guard
until
all
closed
up
and
then
issued
an
order
that
when
he
sounded
the
charge
the
whole
command
was
to
rush
into
the
village
as
we
halted
on
the
top
of
the
hill
overlooking
the
camp
of
the
unsuspecting
indians
general
carr
called
out
to
his
bugler
sound
the
charge
the
bugler
for
a
moment
became
intensely
excited
and
actually
forgot
the
notes
the
general
again
sang
out
sound
the
charge
and
yet
the
bugler
was
unable
to
obey
the
command
quartermaster
hays
who
had
obtained
permission
to
accompany
the
expedition
was
riding
near
the
general
and
comprehending
the
dilemma
of
the
man
rushed
up
to
him
jerked
the
bugle
from
his
hands
and
sounded
the
charge
himself
in
clear
and
distinct
notes
as
the
troops
rushed
forward
he
threw
the
bugle
away
then
drawing
his
pistols
was
among
the
first
men
that
entered
the
village
the
indians
had
just
driven
up
their
horses
and
were
preparing
to
make
a
move
of
the
camp
when
they
saw
the
soldiers
coming
down
upon
them
a
great
many
of
them
succeeded
in
jumping
upon
their
ponies
and
leaving
every
thing
behind
them
advanced
out
of
the
village
and
prepared
to
meet
the
charge
but
upon
second
thought
they
quickly
concluded
that
it
was
useless
to
try
to
check
us
and
those
who
were
mounted
rapidly
rode
away
while
the
others
on
foot
fled
for
safety
to
the
neighboring
hills
we
went
through
their
village
shooting
right
and
left
at
everything
we
saw
the
pawnees
the
regular
soldiers
and
the
officers
were
all
mixed
up
together
and
the
sioux
were
flying
in
every
direction
general
carr
had
instructed
the
command
that
when
they
entered
the
village
they
must
keep
a
sharp
look
out
for
white
women
as
he
was
confident
the
indians
had
some
captives
the
company
which
had
been
ordered
to
take
possession
of
the
village
after
its
capture
soon
found
two
white
women
one
of
whom
had
just
been
killed
and
the
other
wounded
they
were
both
swedes
and
the
survivor
could
not
talk
english
a
swedish
soldier
however
was
soon
found
who
could
talk
with
her
the
name
of
this
woman
was
weichel
and
her
story
as
told
to
the
soldier
was
that
as
soon
as
the
indians
saw
the
troops
coming
down
upon
them
a
squaw
tall
bull
wife
had
killed
alderdice
the
other
captive
with
a
hatchet
and
then
wounded
her
this
squaw
had
evidently
intended
to
kill
both
women
to
prevent
them
from
telling
how
cruelly
they
had
been
treated
illustration
indian
village
the
attack
lasted
but
a
short
time
and
the
indians
were
driven
several
miles
away
the
soldiers
then
gathered
in
the
herd
of
indian
horses
which
were
running
at
large
over
the
country
and
drove
them
back
to
the
camp
after
taking
a
survey
of
what
we
had
accomplished
it
was
found
that
we
had
killed
about
one
hundred
and
forty
indians
and
captured
one
hundred
and
twenty
squaws
and
papooses
two
hundred
lodges
and
eight
hundred
horses
and
mules
the
village
proved
to
be
one
of
the
richest
i
had
ever
seen
the
had
everything
pertaining
to
an
indian
camp
besides
numerous
articles
belonging
to
the
white
settlers
whom
they
had
killed
on
the
saline
the
pawnees
as
well
as
the
soldiers
ransacked
the
camp
for
curiosities
and
found
enough
to
start
twenty
museums
besides
a
large
amount
of
gold
and
silver
this
money
had
been
stolen
from
the
swedish
settlers
whom
they
had
murdered
on
the
saline
general
carr
ordered
that
all
the
tepees
the
indian
lodges
buffalo
robes
all
camp
equipage
and
provisions
including
dried
buffalo
meat
amounting
to
several
tons
should
be
gathered
in
piles
and
burned
a
grave
was
dug
in
which
the
dead
swedish
woman
alderdice
was
buried
captain
kane
a
religious
officer
read
the
burial
service
as
we
had
no
chaplain
with
us
while
this
was
going
on
the
sioux
warriors
having
recovered
from
their
surprise
had
come
back
and
a
battle
took
place
all
around
the
camp
i
was
on
the
skirmish
line
and
i
noticed
an
indian
who
was
riding
a
large
bay
horse
and
giving
orders
to
his
men
in
his
own
language
which
i
could
occasionally
understand
telling
them
that
they
had
lost
everything
that
they
were
ruined
and
he
entreated
them
to
follow
him
and
fight
until
they
died
his
horse
was
an
extraordinary
one
fleet
as
the
wind
dashing
here
and
there
and
i
determined
to
capture
him
if
possible
but
i
was
afraid
to
fire
at
the
indian
for
fear
of
killing
the
horse
i
noticed
that
the
indian
as
he
rode
around
the
skirmish
line
passed
the
head
of
a
ravine
not
far
distant
and
it
occurred
to
me
that
if
i
could
dismount
and
creep
to
the
ravine
i
could
as
he
passed
there
easily
drop
him
from
his
saddle
without
danger
of
hitting
the
horse
accordingly
i
crept
into
and
secreted
myself
in
the
ravine
reaching
the
place
unseen
by
the
indians
and
i
waited
there
until
chief
came
riding
by
when
he
was
not
more
than
thirty
yards
distant
i
fired
and
the
next
moment
he
tumbled
from
his
saddle
and
the
horse
kept
on
without
his
rider
instead
of
running
toward
the
indians
however
he
galloped
toward
our
men
by
one
of
whom
he
was
caught
lieutenant
mason
who
had
been
very
conspicuous
in
the
fight
and
who
had
killed
two
or
three
indians
himself
came
galloping
up
to
the
ravine
and
jumping
from
his
horse
secured
the
fancy
war
bonnet
from
the
head
of
the
dead
chief
together
with
all
his
other
accoutrements
we
both
then
rejoined
the
soldiers
and
i
at
once
went
in
search
of
the
horse
i
found
him
in
the
possession
of
sergeant
mcgrath
who
had
caught
him
the
sergeant
knew
that
i
had
been
trying
to
get
the
animal
and
having
seen
me
kill
his
rider
he
handed
him
over
to
me
at
once
little
did
i
think
at
that
time
that
i
had
captured
a
horse
which
for
four
years
afterwards
was
the
fastest
runner
in
the
state
of
nebraska
but
such
proved
to
be
the
fact
illustration
the
killing
of
tall
bull
i
jumped
on
his
back
and
rode
him
down
to
the
spot
where
the
prisoners
were
corraled
one
of
the
squaws
among
the
prisoners
suddenly
began
crying
in
a
pitiful
and
hysterical
manner
at
the
sight
of
this
horse
and
upon
inquiry
i
found
that
she
was
tall
bull
wife
the
same
squaw
that
had
killed
one
of
the
white
women
and
wounded
the
other
she
stated
that
this
was
her
husband
favorite
and
that
only
a
short
time
ago
she
had
seen
tall
bull
riding
him
i
gave
her
to
understand
that
her
liege
lord
had
passed
in
his
mortal
chips
and
that
it
would
be
sometime
before
he
would
ride
his
favorite
horse
again
and
i
informed
her
that
henceforth
i
should
call
the
gallant
steed
tall
bull
in
honor
of
her
husband
late
in
the
evening
our
wagon
train
arrived
and
placing
the
wounded
woman
weichel
in
the
ambulance
she
having
been
kindly
attended
to
by
the
surgeons
and
gathering
up
the
prisoners
the
squaws
and
papooses
and
captured
stock
we
started
at
once
for
the
south
platte
river
eight
miles
distant
and
there
went
into
camp
next
morning
general
carr
issued
an
order
that
all
the
money
found
in
the
village
should
be
turned
over
to
the
adjutant
about
one
thousand
dollars
was
thus
collected
and
the
entire
amount
was
given
to
weichel
the
command
then
proceeded
to
fort
sedgwick
from
which
point
the
particulars
of
our
fight
which
took
place
on
sunday

were
telegraphed
to
all
parts
of
the
country
we
remained
at
this
post
for
two
weeks
during
which
general
augur
of
the
department
of
the
platte
paid
us
a
visit
and
highly
complimented
the
command
for
the
gallant
service
it
had
performed
for
this
fight
at
summit
springs
general
carr
and
his
command
were
complimented
not
only
in
general
orders
but
received
a
vote
of
thanks
from
the
legislatures
of
nebraska
and
colorado
as
tall
bull
and
his
indians
had
long
been
a
terror
to
the
border
settlements
and
the
resolutions
of
thanks
were
elegantly
engrossed
and
sent
to
general
carr
the
wounded
white
woman
was
cared
for
in
the
hospital
at
this
post
and
after
her
recovery
she
soon
married
the
hospital
steward
her
former
husband
having
been
killed
by
the
indians
our
prisoners
were
sent
to
the
whetstone
agency
on
the
missouri
river
where
spotted
tail
and
the
friendly
sioux
were
then
living
the
captured
horses
and
mules
were
distributed
among
the
officers
scouts
and
soldiers
among
the
animals
that
i
thus
obtained
were
my
tall
bull
horse
and
a
pony
which
i
called
powder
face
and
which
afterwards
became
quite
celebrated
as
he
figured
prominently
in
the
stories
of
ned
buntline
one
day
while
we
were
lying
at
fort
sedgwick
general
carr
received
a
telegram
from
fort
mcpherson
stating
that
the
indians
had
made
a
dash
on
the
union
pacific
railroad
and
had
killed
several
and
run
off
some
stock
near
station
also
that
an
expedition
was
going
out
from
fort
mcpherson
to
catch
and
punish
the
if
possible
the
general
ordered
me
to
accompany
the
expedition
and
accordingly
that
night
i
proceeded
by
rail
to
mcpherson
station
and
from
thence
rode
on
horseback
to
the
fort
two
companies
under
command
of
major
brown
had
been
ordered
out
and
next
morning
just
as
we
were
about
to
start
major
brown
said
to
me
by
the
way
cody
we
are
going
to
have
quite
an
important
character
with
us
as
a
guest
on
this
scout
it
old
ned
buntline
the
novelist
just
then
i
noticed
a
gentleman
who
was
rather
stoutly
built
and
who
wore
a
blue
military
coat
on
the
left
breast
of
which
were
pinned
about
twenty
gold
medals
and
badges
of
secret
societies
he
walked
a
little
lame
as
he
approached
us
and
i
at
once
concluded
that
he
was
ned
buntline
he
has
a
good
mark
to
shoot
at
on
the
left
breast
said
i
to
major
brown
but
he
looks
like
a
soldier
as
he
came
up
major
brown
said
cody
allow
me
to
introduce
you
to
colonel
judson
otherwise
known
as
ned
buntline
colonel
judson
i
am
glad
to
meet
you
said
i
the
major
tells
me
that
you
are
to
accompany
us
on
the
scout
yes
my
boy
so
i
am
said
he
i
was
to
deliver
a
temperance
lecture
but
no
lectures
for
me
when
there
is
a
prospect
for
a
fight
the
major
has
kindly
offered
me
a
horse
but
i
do
know
how
i
stand
the
ride
for
i
have
done
any
riding
lately
but
when
i
was
a
young
man
i
spent
several
years
among
the
fur
companies
of
the
northwest
and
was
a
good
rider
and
an
excellent
shot
the
major
has
given
you
a
fine
horse
and
you
soon
find
yourself
at
home
in
the
saddle
said
i
the
command
soon
pulled
out
for
the
south
platte
river
which
was
very
wide
and
high
owing
to
recent
mountain
rains
and
in
crossing
it
we
had
to
swim
our
horses
in
some
places
buntline
was
the
first
man
across
we
reached
at
eleven
and
in
a
short
time
i
succeeded
in
finding
the
indian
trail
the
party
seemed
to
be
a
small
one
which
had
come
up
from
the
south
we
followed
their
track
to
the
north
platte
but
as
they
had
a
start
of
two
days
major
brown
abandoned
the
pursuit
and
returned
to
fort
mcpherson
while
i
went
back
to
fort
sedgwick
accompanied
by
buntline
during
this
short
scout
buntline
had
asked
me
a
great
many
questions
and
he
was
determined
to
go
out
on
the
next
expedition
with
me
providing
he
could
obtain
permission
from
the
commanding
officer
i
introduced
him
to
the
officers
excepting
those
he
already
knew
and
invited
him
to
become
my
guest
while
he
remained
at
the
post
and
gave
him
my
pony
powder
face
to
ride
by
this
time
i
had
learned
that
my
horse
tall
bull
was
a
remarkably
fast
runner
and
therefore
when
lieutenant
mason
who
was
quite
a
sport
and
owned
a
racer
challenged
me
to
a
race
i
immediately
accepted
it
we
were
to
run
our
horses
a
single
dash
of
half
a
mile
for
one
hundred
dollars
a
side
several
of
the
officers
and
also
reub
wood
the
bantered
me
for
side
bets
and
i
took
them
all
until
i
had
put
up
my
last
cent
on
tall
bull
the
ground
was
measured
off
the
judges
were
selected
and
all
other
preliminaries
were
arranged
we
rode
our
horses
ourselves
and
coming
up
to
the
score
nicely
we
let
them
go
i
saw
from
the
start
that
it
would
be
mere
play
to
beat
the
lieutenant
horse
and
therefore
i
held
tall
bull
in
check
so
that
none
could
see
how
fast
he
really
could
run
i
easily
won
the
race
and
pocketed
a
snug
little
sum
of
money
of
course
everybody
was
now
talking
horse
major
north
remarked
that
if
tall
bull
could
beat
the
pawnees
fast
horse
i
could
break
his
whole
command
the
next
day
the
troops
were
paid
off
the
pawnees
with
the
rest
and
for
two
or
three
days
they
did
nothing
but
run
as
all
the
recently
captured
horses
had
to
be
tested
to
find
out
the
swiftest
among
them
finally
the
pawnees
wanted
to
run
their
favorite
horse
against
tall
bull
and
i
accordingly
arranged
a
race
with
them
they
raised
three
hundred
dollars
and
bet
it
on
their
horse
while
of
course
i
backed
tall
bull
with
an
equal
amount
and
in
addition
took
numerous
side
bets
the
race
was
a
single
dash
of
a
mile
and
tall
bull
won
it
without
any
difficulty
i
was
ahead
on
this
race
about
seven
hundred
dollars
and
the
horse
was
fast
getting
a
reputation
heretofore
nobody
would
bet
on
him
but
now
he
had
plenty
of
backers
i
also
made
a
race
for
my
pony
powder
face
against
a
fast
pony
belonging
to
captain
lute
north
i
selected
a
small
boy
living
at
the
post
to
ride
powder
face
while
an
indian
boy
was
to
ride
the
other
pony
the
pawnees
as
usual
wanted
to
bet
on
their
pony
but
as
i
had
not
yet
fully
ascertained
the
running
qualities
of
powder
face
i
did
not
care
about
risking
very
much
money
on
him
had
i
known
him
as
well
then
as
i
did
afterwards
i
would
have
backed
him
for
every
dollar
i
had
for
he
proved
to
be
one
of
the
swiftest
ponies
i
ever
saw
and
had
evidently
been
kept
as
a
racer
the
race
was
to
be
four
hundred
yards
and
when
i
led
the
pony
over
the
track
he
seemed
to
understand
what
he
was
there
for
north
and
i
finally
put
the
riders
on
and
it
was
all
i
could
do
to
hold
the
fiery
little
animal
after
the
boy
became
seated
on
his
back
he
jumped
around
and
made
such
quick
movements
that
the
boy
was
not
at
all
confident
of
being
able
to
stay
on
him
the
order
to
start
was
at
last
given
by
the
judges
and
as
i
brought
powder
face
up
to
the
score
and
the
word
go
was
given
he
jumped
away
so
quickly
that
he
left
his
rider
sitting
on
the
ground
notwithstanding
he
ran
through
and
won
the
race
without
him
it
was
an
easy
victory
and
after
that
i
could
get
up
no
more
races
thus
passed
the
time
while
we
were
at
fort
sedgwick
general
carr
having
obtained
a
leave
of
absence
colonel
royal
was
given
the
command
of
an
expedition
that
was
ordered
to
go
out
after
the
indians
and
in
a
few
days
after
having
rested
a
couple
of
weeks
we
set
out
for
the
republican
having
learned
that
there
were
plenty
of
indians
in
that
section
of
the
country
at
frenchman
fork
we
discovered
an
indian
village
but
did
not
surprise
it
for
its
people
had
noticed
us
approaching
and
were
retreating
when
we
reached
their
we
chased
them
down
the
stream
and
they
finally
turned
to
the
left
went
north
and
crossed
the
south
platte
river
five
miles
above
ogallala
we
pushed
rapidly
after
them
following
them
across
the
north
platte
and
on
through
the
towards
the
niobrara
but
as
they
were
making
much
better
time
than
we
the
pursuit
was
abandoned
while
we
were
in
the
scouting
the
niobrara
country
the
pawnee
indians
brought
into
camp
one
night
some
very
large
bones
one
of
which
a
surgeon
of
the
expedition
pronounced
to
be
the
of
a
human
being
the
indians
claimed
that
the
bones
they
had
found
were
those
of
a
person
belonging
to
a
race
of
people
who
a
long
time
ago
lived
in
this
country
that
there
was
once
a
race
of
men
on
the
earth
whose
size
was
about
three
times
that
of
an
ordinary
man
and
they
were
so
swift
and
powerful
that
they
could
run
of
a
buffalo
and
taking
the
animal
in
one
arm
could
tear
off
a
leg
and
eat
the
meat
as
they
walked
these
giants
denied
the
existence
of
a
great
spirit
and
when
they
heard
the
thunder
or
saw
the
lightning
they
laughed
at
it
and
said
that
they
were
greater
than
either
this
so
displeased
the
great
spirit
that
he
caused
a
great
to
come
and
the
water
kept
rising
higher
and
higher
so
that
it
drove
those
proud
and
conceited
giants
from
the
low
grounds
to
the
hills
and
thence
to
the
mountains
but
at
last
even
the
mountain
tops
were
submerged
and
then
those
mammoth
men
were
all
drowned
after
the
flood
had
subsided
the
great
spirit
came
to
the
conclusion
that
he
had
made
man
too
large
and
powerful
and
that
he
would
therefore
correct
the
mistake
by
creating
a
race
of
men
of
smaller
size
and
less
strength
this
is
the
reason
say
the
indians
that
modern
men
are
small
and
not
like
the
giants
of
old
and
they
claim
that
this
story
is
a
matter
of
indian
history
which
has
been
handed
down
among
them
from
time
immemorial
as
we
had
no
wagons
with
us
at
the
time
this
large
and
heavy
bone
was
found
we
were
obliged
to
leave
it
chapter
xxiii
administering
justice
on
returning
to
fort
mcpherson
we
found
that
brevet
major
general
emory
colonel
of
the
fifth
cavalry
and
brevet
brigadier
general
thomas
duncan
lieutenant
colonel
of
the
regiment
had
arrived
there
during
our
absence
general
emory
had
been
appointed
to
the
command
of
the
district
of
the
republican
with
headquarters
at
fort
mcpherson
as
the
command
had
been
continually
in
the
field
it
was
generally
thought
that
we
were
to
have
a
long
rest
and
it
looked
as
if
this
post
was
to
be
my
home
and
headquarters
for
some
time
to
come
i
accordingly
sent
to
louis
for
my
wife
and
daughter
to
join
me
there
general
emory
promised
to
build
a
house
for
me
but
before
the
building
was
completed
my
family
arrived
during
the
fall
of
there
were
two
or
three
scouting
expeditions
sent
out
but
nothing
of
very
great
importance
was
accomplished
by
them
i
found
fort
mcpherson
to
be
a
lively
and
pleasant
post
to
be
stationed
at
especially
as
there
was
plenty
of
game
in
the
vicinity
and
within
a
day
ride
there
were
large
herds
of
deer
antelope
and
elk
during
the
winter
of
i
spent
a
great
deal
of
time
in
pursuit
of
game
and
during
the
season
we
had
two
hunting
parties
of
englishmen
there
one
party
being
that
of
flynn
and
the
other
that
of
george
boyd
houghton
of
london
the
well
known
caricaturist
among
their
amusements
were
several
horse
races
which
i
arranged
and
in
which
tall
bull
and
powder
face
were
invariably
the
winners
tall
bull
by
this
time
had
such
a
reputation
as
a
running
horse
that
it
was
difficult
to
make
a
race
for
him
i
remember
one
however
in
which
he
ran
against
a
horse
in
captain
spaulding
company
of
the
second
cavalry
this
race
was
rather
a
novel
affair
i
had
made
a
bet
that
tall
bull
would
beat
the
second
cavalry
horse
around
a
one
mile
track
and
during
the
time
that
he
was
running
i
would
jump
off
and
on
the
horse
eight
times
i
rode
the
horse
bareback
seized
his
mane
with
my
left
hand
rested
my
right
on
his
withers
and
while
he
was
going
at
full
speed
i
jumped
to
the
ground
and
sprang
again
upon
his
back
eight
times
in
succession
such
feats
i
had
seen
performed
in
the
circus
and
i
had
practiced
considerably
at
it
with
tall
bull
so
that
i
was
certain
of
winning
the
race
in
the
manner
agreed
upon
early
one
morning
in
the
spring
of
the
indians
who
had
approached
during
the
night
stole
some
head
of
horses
from
john
burke
a
government
contractor
ben
gallagher
and
jack
waite
they
also
ran
off
some
horses
from
the
post
among
the
number
being
my
pony
powder
face
the
commandant
at
once
ordered
out
lieutenant
thomas
with
company
i
of
the
fifth
cavalry
and
directed
me
to
accompany
them
as
trailer
we
discovered
the
trail
after
some
little
difficulty
as
the
indians
were
continually
trying
to
hide
it
and
followed
it
sixty
miles
when
darkness
set
in
we
were
now
within
about
four
miles
of
red
willow
creek
and
i
felt
confident
the
indians
would
camp
that
night
in
that
vicinity
advising
lieutenant
thomas
to
halt
his
company
and
lay
low
i
proceeded
on
to
the
creek
where
moving
around
cautiously
i
suddenly
discovered
horses
feeding
in
a
bend
of
the
stream
on
the
opposite
side
i
hurried
back
to
the
troops
with
the
information
and
lieutenant
thomas
moved
his
company
to
the
bank
of
the
creek
with
the
intention
of
remaining
there
until
daylight
and
then
if
possible
surprise
the
indians
just
at
break
of
day
we
mounted
our
horses
and
after
riding
a
short
distance
we
ascended
a
slight
elevation
when
not
over
one
hundred
yards
distant
we
looked
down
into
the
indian
camp
the
indians
preparing
to
make
an
early
start
had
driven
up
their
horses
and
were
in
the
act
of
mounting
when
they
saw
us
charging
down
upon
them
in
a
moment
they
sprang
upon
their
ponies
and
dashed
away
had
it
not
been
for
the
creek
which
lay
between
us
and
them
we
would
have
got
them
before
they
could
have
mounted
their
horses
but
as
it
was
rather
miry
we
were
unexpectedly
delayed
the
indians
fired
some
shots
at
us
while
we
were
crossing
but
as
soon
as
we
got
across
we
went
for
them
in
hot
pursuit
a
few
of
the
had
not
had
time
to
mount
and
had
started
on
foot
down
the
creek
toward
the
brush
one
of
these
was
killed
a
number
of
our
soldiers
who
had
been
detailed
before
the
charge
to
gather
up
any
of
the
indian
horses
that
would
be
stampeded
succeeded
in
capturing
i
hurriedly
looked
over
them
to
see
if
powder
face
was
among
them
but
he
was
not
there
starting
in
pursuit
of
the
fugitives
i
finally
espied
an
indian
mounted
on
my
favorite
dashing
away
and
leading
all
the
others
we
continued
the
chase
for
two
or
three
miles
overtaking
a
couple
who
were
mounted
upon
one
horse
coming
up
behind
them
i
fired
my
rifle
when
about
thirty
feet
distant
the
ball
passed
through
the
backs
of
both
and
they
fell
headlong
to
the
ground
but
i
made
no
stop
however
just
then
for
i
had
my
eye
on
the
gentleman
who
was
riding
powder
face
it
seemed
to
be
fun
for
him
to
run
away
from
us
and
run
away
he
did
for
the
last
i
saw
of
him
was
when
he
went
over
a
divide
about
three
miles
away
i
bade
him
adieu
on
my
way
back
to
the
indian
camp
i
stopped
and
secured
the
war
bonnets
and
accoutrements
of
the
pair
i
had
killed
and
at
the
same
time
gently
raised
their
hair
we
were
feeling
rather
tired
and
hungry
as
we
had
started
out
on
the
trail
hours
before
without
a
breakfast
or
taking
any
food
with
us
but
not
a
murmur
or
complaint
was
heard
among
the
men
in
the
abandoned
indian
camp
however
we
found
enough
dried
buffalo
meat
to
give
us
all
a
meal
and
after
remaining
there
for
two
hours
to
rest
our
animals
we
started
on
our
return
to
fort
mcpherson
where
we
arrived
at
night
having
traveled
miles
in
two
days
this
being
the
first
fight
lieutenant
thomas
had
ever
commanded
in
he
felt
highly
elated
over
his
success
and
hoped
that
his
name
would
be
mentioned
in
the
special
orders
for
gallantry
sure
enough
when
we
returned
both
he
myself
and
the
whole
command
received
a
complimentary
mention
in
a
special
order
this
he
certainly
deserved
for
he
was
a
brave
energetic
dashing
little
officer
the
war
bonnets
which
i
had
captured
i
turned
over
to
general
carr
with
the
request
that
he
present
them
to
general
augur
whose
daughters
were
visiting
at
the
post
at
the
time
shortly
after
this
another
expedition
was
organized
at
fort
mcpherson
for
the
republican
river
country
it
was
commanded
by
general
duncan
who
was
a
jolly
blustering
old
fellow
and
the
officers
who
knew
him
well
said
that
we
would
have
a
good
time
as
he
was
very
fond
of
hunting
he
was
a
good
fighter
and
one
of
the
officers
said
that
an
indian
bullet
never
could
hurt
him
as
he
had
been
shot
in
the
head
with
a
cannon
ball
which
had
not
injured
him
in
the
least
another
said
the
ball
glanced
off
and
killed
one
of
the
toughest
mules
in
the
army
the
pawnee
scouts
who
had
been
mustered
out
of
service
during
the
winter
of
and
were
reorganized
to
accompany
this
expedition
i
was
glad
of
this
as
i
had
become
quite
attached
to
one
of
the
officers
major
north
and
to
many
of
the
indians
the
only
white
scout
we
had
at
the
post
besides
myself
at
that
time
was
john
nelson
whose
indian
name
was
c
which
interpreted
means
this
man
is
a
character
in
his
way
he
has
a
sioux
squaw
for
a
wife
and
consequently
a
family
john
is
a
good
fellow
though
as
a
liar
he
has
but
few
equals
and
no
superior
footnote
c
since
traveled
with
me
in
my
dramatic
combination
as
interpreter
for
sioux
indians
we
started
out
from
the
post
with
the
regimental
band
playing
the
lively
air
of
the
girl
i
left
behind
me
we
made
but
a
short
march
that
day
and
camped
at
night
at
the
head
of
fox
creek
next
morning
general
duncan
sent
me
word
by
his
orderly
that
i
was
to
bring
up
my
gun
and
shoot
at
a
mark
with
him
but
i
can
assure
the
reader
that
i
did
not
feel
much
like
shooting
anything
except
myself
for
on
the
night
before
i
had
returned
to
fort
mcpherson
and
spent
several
hours
in
interviewing
the
store
in
company
with
major
brown
i
looked
around
for
my
gun
and
found
that
i
had
left
it
behind
the
last
i
could
remember
about
it
was
that
i
had
it
at
the
sutler
store
i
informed
major
brown
of
my
loss
who
said
that
i
was
a
nice
scout
to
start
out
without
a
gun
i
replied
that
that
was
not
the
worst
of
it
as
general
duncan
had
sent
for
me
to
shoot
a
match
with
him
and
i
did
not
know
what
to
do
for
if
the
old
gentleman
discovered
my
predicament
he
would
very
likely
severely
reprimand
me
well
cody
said
he
the
best
you
can
do
is
to
make
some
excuse
and
then
go
and
borrow
a
gun
from
some
of
the
men
and
tell
the
general
that
you
lent
yours
to
some
man
to
go
hunting
with
while
we
are
waiting
here
i
will
send
back
to
the
post
and
get
your
rifle
for
you
i
succeeded
in
obtaining
a
gun
from
john
nelson
and
then
marching
up
to
the
general
headquarters
i
shot
the
desired
match
with
him
which
resulted
in
his
favor
this
was
the
first
scout
the
pawnees
had
been
out
on
under
command
of
general
duncan
and
in
stationing
his
guards
around
the
camp
he
posted
them
in
a
manner
entirely
different
from
that
of
general
carr
and
colonel
royal
and
he
insisted
that
the
different
posts
should
call
out
the
hour
of
the
night
thus
post
no
nine
all
is
well
post
no
nine
all
is
well
etc
the
pawnees
who
had
their
regular
turns
at
standing
upon
guard
were
ordered
to
call
the
hour
the
same
as
the
white
soldiers
this
was
very
difficult
for
them
to
do
as
there
were
but
few
of
them
who
could
express
themselves
in
english
major
north
explained
to
them
that
when
the
man
on
post
next
to
them
should
call
out
the
hour
they
must
call
it
also
as
near
like
him
as
possible
it
was
very
amusing
to
hear
them
do
this
they
would
try
to
remember
what
the
other
man
had
said
on
the
post
next
to
them
for
instance
a
white
soldier
would
call
out
post
no
i
nine
all
is
well
the
indian
standing
next
to
him
knew
that
he
was
bound
to
say
something
in
english
and
he
would
sing
out
something
like
the
following
poss
number
half
pass
five
cents
go
to
i
do
care
this
system
was
really
so
ridiculous
and
amusing
that
the
general
had
to
give
it
up
and
the
order
was
accordingly
countermanded
nothing
of
any
great
interest
occurred
on
this
march
until
one
day
while
proceeding
up
prairie
dog
creek
d
major
north
and
myself
went
out
in
advance
of
the
command
several
miles
and
killed
a
number
of
buffaloes
night
was
approaching
and
i
began
to
look
around
for
a
suitable
camping
ground
for
the
command
major
north
dismounted
from
his
horse
and
was
resting
while
i
rode
down
to
the
stream
to
see
if
there
was
plenty
of
grass
in
the
vicinity
i
found
an
excellent
camping
spot
and
returning
to
major
north
told
him
that
i
would
ride
over
the
hill
a
little
way
so
that
the
advance
guard
could
see
me
this
i
did
and
when
the
advance
came
in
sight
i
dismounted
and
laid
down
upon
the
grass
to
rest
footnote
d
near
the
lonely
camp
where
i
had
so
long
been
laid
up
with
a
broken
leg
when
trapping
years
before
with
dave
harrington
suddenly
i
heard
three
or
four
shots
and
in
a
few
moments
major
north
came
dashing
up
towards
me
pursued
by
eight
or
ten
indians
i
instantly
sprang
into
my
saddle
and
fired
a
few
shots
at
the
indians
who
by
this
time
had
all
come
in
sight
to
the
number
of
fifty
we
turned
our
horses
and
ran
the
bullets
flying
after
us
thick
and
fast
my
whip
being
shot
from
my
hand
and
daylight
being
put
through
the
crown
of
my
hat
we
were
in
close
quarters
when
suddenly
lieutenant
valkmar
came
galloping
up
to
our
relief
with
several
soldiers
and
the
indians
seeing
them
whirled
and
retreated
as
soon
as
major
north
got
in
sight
of
his
pawnees
he
began
riding
in
a
circle
this
was
a
sign
to
them
that
there
were
hostile
indians
in
front
and
in
a
moment
the
pawnees
broke
ranks
and
with
major
north
at
their
head
started
for
the
flying
warriors
the
rest
of
the
command
pushed
rapidly
forward
also
and
chased
the
enemy
for
three
or
four
miles
killing
three
of
them
but
this
was
a
wrong
move
on
our
part
as
their
village
was
on
prairie
dog
creek
while
they
led
us
in
a
different
direction
one
indian
only
kept
straight
on
up
the
creek
a
messenger
to
the
village
some
of
the
command
who
had
followed
him
stirred
up
the
village
and
accelerated
its
departure
we
finally
got
back
to
the
main
force
and
then
learned
that
we
had
made
a
great
mistake
now
commenced
another
stern
chase
the
second
day
that
we
had
been
following
these
indians
we
came
upon
an
old
squaw
whom
they
had
left
on
the
prairie
to
die
her
people
had
built
for
her
a
little
shade
or
lodge
and
had
given
her
some
provisions
sufficient
to
last
her
on
her
trip
to
the
happy
hunting
grounds
this
the
indians
often
do
when
pursued
by
an
enemy
and
one
of
their
number
becomes
too
old
and
feeble
to
travel
any
longer
this
squaw
was
recognized
by
john
nelson
who
said
that
she
was
a
relative
of
his
wife
from
her
we
learned
that
the
flying
indians
were
known
as
pawnee
killer
band
and
that
they
had
lately
killed
buck
surveying
party
consisting
of
eight
or
nine
men
the
massacre
having
occurred
a
few
days
before
on
beaver
creek
we
knew
that
they
had
had
a
fight
with
surveyors
as
we
found
quite
a
number
of
surveying
instruments
which
had
been
left
in
the
abandoned
camp
we
drove
these
indians
across
the
platte
river
and
then
returned
to
fort
mcpherson
bringing
the
old
squaw
with
us
from
there
she
was
sent
to
the
spotted
tail
agency
during
my
absence
my
wife
had
given
birth
to
a
son
and
he
was
several
weeks
old
when
i
returned
no
name
had
yet
been
given
him
and
i
selected
that
of
elmo
judson
in
honor
of
ned
buntline
but
this
the
officers
and
scouts
objected
to
major
brown
proposed
that
we
should
call
him
kit
carson
and
it
was
finally
settled
that
that
should
be
his
name
during
the
summer
we
made
one
or
two
more
scouts
and
had
a
few
skirmishes
with
the
indians
but
nothing
of
any
great
importance
transpired
in
the
fall
of
while
i
was
a
witness
in
a
court
martial
at
fort
russell
i
woke
up
one
morning
and
found
that
i
was
dead
broke
this
is
not
an
unusual
occurrence
to
a
frontiersman
or
an
author
i
may
add
especially
when
he
is
endeavoring
to
kill
time
to
raise
necessary
funds
i
sold
my
race
horse
tall
bull
to
lieutenant
mason
who
had
long
wanted
him
in
the
winter
of
and
i
first
met
george
watts
garland
an
english
gentleman
and
a
great
hunter
whom
i
had
the
pleasure
of
guiding
on
several
hunts
and
with
whom
i
spent
some
weeks
during
the
winter
i
also
took
several
parties
out
on
the
loupe
river
country
hunting
and
trapping
although
i
was
still
chief
of
scouts
i
did
not
have
much
to
do
as
the
indians
were
comparatively
quiet
thus
giving
me
plenty
of
time
for
sporting
in
the
spring
of
several
short
scouting
expeditions
were
sent
out
from
fort
mcpherson
but
all
with
minor
results
about
this
time
general
emory
was
considerably
annoyed
by
petty
offenses
committed
in
the
vicinity
of
the
post
and
as
there
was
no
justice
of
the
peace
in
the
neighborhood
he
was
anxious
to
have
such
an
officer
there
to
attend
to
the
civilians
one
day
he
remarked
to
me
that
i
would
make
an
excellent
justice
general
you
compliment
me
rather
too
highly
for
i
do
know
any
more
about
law
than
a
government
mule
does
about
said
i
that
does
make
any
difference
said
he
for
i
know
that
you
will
make
a
good
he
accordingly
had
the
county
commissioners
appoint
me
to
the
office
of
justice
of
the
peace
and
i
soon
received
my
commission
one
morning
a
man
came
rushing
up
to
my
house
and
stated
that
he
wanted
to
get
out
a
writ
of
replevin
to
recover
possession
of
a
horse
which
a
stranger
was
taking
out
of
the
country
i
had
no
blank
forms
and
had
not
yet
received
the
statutes
of
nebraska
to
copy
from
so
i
asked
the
man
where
is
the
fellow
who
has
got
your
horse
he
is
going
up
the
road
and
is
about
two
miles
away
replied
he
very
well
said
i
i
will
get
the
writ
ready
in
a
minute
or
two
i
saddled
up
my
horse
and
then
taking
my
old
reliable
gun
lucretia
i
said
to
the
man
that
the
best
writ
of
replevin
that
i
can
think
of
come
along
and
we
get
that
horse
or
know
the
reason
why
we
soon
overtook
the
stranger
who
was
driving
a
herd
of
horses
and
as
we
came
up
to
him
i
said
hello
sir
i
am
an
officer
and
have
an
attachment
for
that
horse
and
at
the
same
time
i
pointed
out
the
animal
well
sir
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
it
he
inquired
i
propose
to
take
you
and
the
horse
back
to
the
post
said
i
you
can
take
the
horse
said
he
but
i
have
the
time
to
return
with
you
you
have
to
take
the
time
or
pay
the
costs
here
and
now
said
i
how
much
are
the
costs
twenty
dollars
here
your
money
said
he
as
he
handed
me
the
greenbacks
i
then
gave
him
a
little
friendly
advice
and
told
him
that
he
was
released
from
custody
he
went
on
his
way
a
wiser
and
a
poorer
man
while
the
owner
of
the
horse
and
myself
returned
to
the
fort
i
pocketed
the
twenty
dollars
of
course
some
people
might
think
it
was
not
a
square
way
of
doing
business
but
i
did
know
any
better
just
then
i
had
several
little
cases
of
this
kind
and
i
became
better
posted
on
law
in
the
course
of
time
being
assisted
by
lieutenant
burr
reilly
of
the
fifth
cavalry
who
had
been
educated
for
a
lawyer
one
evening
i
was
called
upon
to
perform
a
marriage
ceremony
the
bridegroom
was
one
of
the
sergeants
of
the
post
i
had
braced
up
for
the
occasion
by
imbibing
rather
freely
of
stimulants
and
when
i
arrived
at
the
house
with
a
copy
of
the
statutes
of
nebraska
which
i
had
recently
received
i
felt
somewhat
confused
whether
my
bewilderment
was
owing
to
the
importance
of
the
occasion
and
the
large
assembly
or
to
the
effect
of
louis
woodin
tanglefoot
i
can
not
now
distinctly
remember
but
my
suspicions
have
always
been
that
it
was
due
to
the
latter
cause
i
looked
carefully
through
the
statutes
to
find
the
marriage
ceremony
but
my
efforts
were
unsuccessful
finally
the
time
came
for
the
knot
to
be
tied
i
told
the
couple
to
stand
up
and
then
i
said
to
the
bridegroom
do
you
take
this
woman
to
be
your
lawful
wedded
wife
to
support
and
love
her
through
life
i
do
was
the
reply
then
addressing
myself
to
the
bride
i
said
do
you
take
this
man
to
be
your
lawful
wedded
husband
through
life
to
love
honor
and
obey
him
illustration
a
wedding
ceremony
i
do
was
her
response
then
join
hands
said
i
to
both
of
them
i
now
pronounce
you
to
be
man
and
wife
and
whomsoever
god
and
buffalo
bill
have
joined
together
let
no
man
put
asunder
may
you
live
long
and
prosper
amen
this
concluded
the
interesting
ceremony
which
was
followed
by
the
usual
festivities
on
such
occasions
i
was
highly
complimented
for
the
elegant
and
eloquent
manner
in
which
i
had
tied
the
matrimonial
knot
during
the
summer
of
professor
marsh
of
yale
college
came
out
to
mcpherson
with
a
large
party
of
students
to
have
a
hunt
and
to
look
for
fossils
professor
marsh
had
heard
of
the
big
bone
which
had
been
found
by
the
pawnees
in
the
niobrara
country
and
he
intended
to
look
for
that
as
well
as
other
bones
he
accordingly
secured
the
services
of
major
frank
north
and
the
pawnees
as
an
escort
i
was
also
to
accompany
the
and
would
have
done
so
had
it
not
been
for
the
fact
that
just
at
that
time
i
was
ordered
out
with
a
small
scouting
party
to
go
after
some
indians
illustration
a
ride
for
life
the
day
before
the
professor
arrived
at
the
fort
i
had
been
out
hunting
on
the
north
side
of
the
north
platte
river
near
pawnee
springs
with
several
companions
when
we
were
suddenly
attacked
by
indians
who
wounded
one
of
our
number
john
weister
we
stood
the
indians
off
for
a
little
while
and
weister
got
even
with
them
by
killing
one
of
their
party
the
indians
however
outnumbered
us
and
at
last
we
were
forced
to
make
a
run
for
our
lives
in
this
we
succeeded
and
reached
the
fort
in
safety
the
general
wanted
to
have
the
indians
pursued
and
said
he
could
not
spare
me
to
accompany
professor
marsh
however
i
had
the
opportunity
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
the
eminent
professor
whom
i
found
to
be
not
only
a
person
but
a
very
entertaining
gentleman
he
gave
me
a
geological
history
of
the
country
told
me
in
what
section
fossils
were
to
be
found
and
otherwise
entertained
me
with
several
scientific
yarns
some
of
which
seemed
too
complicated
and
too
mysterious
to
be
believed
by
an
ordinary
man
like
myself
but
it
was
all
clear
to
him
i
rode
out
with
him
several
miles
as
he
was
starting
on
his
expedition
and
i
greatly
enjoyed
the
ride
his
party
had
been
provided
with
government
transportation
and
his
students
were
all
mounted
on
government
horses
as
we
rode
along
he
delivered
a
scientific
lecture
and
he
convinced
me
that
he
knew
what
he
was
talking
about
i
finally
bade
him
and
returned
to
the
post
while
the
were
out
on
their
expedition
we
had
several
lively
little
skirmishes
with
the
indians
after
having
been
absent
some
little
time
professor
marsh
and
his
party
came
back
with
their
wagons
loaded
down
with
all
kinds
of
bones
and
the
professor
was
in
his
glory
he
had
evidently
struck
a
and
gad
e
was
he
happy
but
they
had
failed
to
find

bone
which
the

had
unearthed

hospitably

besides
these
there
were
three
ambulances
in
which
the
guns
were
carried
and
in
which
members
of
the
party
who
became
weary
of
the
saddle
might
ride
and
rest
at
general
sheridan
request
i
was
to
accompany
the
expedition
he
introduced
me
to
all
his
friends
and
gave
me
a
good
during
the
afternoon
and
evening
the
gentlemen
were
all
entertained
at
the
post
in
a
variety
of
ways
including
dinner
and
supper
parties
and
music
and
dancing
at
a
late
hour
they
retired
to
rest
in
their
tents
at
the
camp
which
they
occupied
outside
the
post
named
camp
rucker
in
honor
of
general
rucker
at
five
next
morning
a
cavalry
bugle
sounded
the
and
soon
all
were
astir
in
the
camp
preparatory
to
pulling
out
for
the
first
day
march
i
rose
fresh
and
eager
for
the
trip
and
as
it
was
a
nobby
and
outfit
which
i
was
to
accompany
i
determined
to
put
on
a
little
style
myself
so
i
dressed
in
a
new
suit
of
light
buckskin
trimmed
along
the
seams
with
fringes
of
the
same
material
and
i
put
on
a
crimson
shirt
handsomely
ornamented
on
the
bosom
while
on
my
head
i
wore
a
broad
then
mounting
a
snowy
white
horse
a
gallant
stepper
i
rode
down
from
the
fort
to
the
camp
rifle
in
hand
i
felt
that
morning
and
looked
well
the
expedition
was
soon
under
way
our
road
for
ten
miles
wound
through
a
wooded
ravine
called
cottonwood
cañon
intersecting
the
high
ground
or
divide
as
it
is
called
between
the
platte
and
republican
rivers
upon
emerging
from
the
cañon
we
found
ourselves
upon
the
plains
first
in
the
line
rode
general
sheridan
followed
by
his
guests
and
then
the
orderlies
then
came
the
ambulances
in
one
of
which
were
carried
five
greyhounds
brought
along
to
course
the
antelope
and
rabbit
with
the
ambulances
marched
a
pair
of
indian
ponies
belonging
to
lieutenant
hayes
captured
during
some
indian
fight
and
harnessed
to
a
light
wagon
which
general
sheridan
occasionally
used
these
little
horses
but
thirteen
hands
high
showed
more
vigor
and
endurance
than
any
other
of
the
animals
we
had
with
us
following
the
ambulances
came
the
main
body
of
the
escort
and
the
supply
wagons
we
marched
seventeen
miles
the
first
day
and
went
into
camp
on
fox
creek
a
tributary
of
the
republican
no
hunting
had
as
yet
been
done
but
i
informed
the
gentlemen
of
the
party
that
we
would
strike
the
buffalo
country
the
next
day
a
hundred
or
more
questions
were
then
asked
me
by
this
one
and
that
one
and
the
whole
evening
was
spent
principally
in
buffalo
talk
sandwiched
with
stories
of
the
plains
both
of
war
and
of
the
chase
several
of
the
party
who
were
good
vocalists
gave
us
some
excellent
music
we
closed
the
evening
by
christening
the
camp
naming
it
camp
brown
in
honor
of
the
gallant
officer
in
command
of
the
escort
at
three
next
morning
the
bugle
called
us
to
an
early
start
we
had
breakfast
at
four
and
at
six
were
in
the
saddle
all
were
eager
to
see
and
shoot
the
buffaloes
which
i
assured
them
we
would
certainly
meet
during
the
day
after
marching
five
miles
the
advance
guard
of
which
i
had
the
command
discovered
six
buffaloes
grazing
at
a
distance
of
about
two
miles
from
us
we
returned
to
the
hunters
with
this
information
and
they
at
once
consulted
with
me
as
to
the
best
way
to
attack
the
enemy
acting
upon
my
suggestions
fitzhugh
crosby
lawrence
jerome
livingston
hecksher
and
rogers
accompanied
by
myself
as
guide
rode
through
a
convenient
cañon
to
a
point
beyond
the
buffaloes
so
that
we
were
to
the
windward
of
the
animals
the
rest
of
the
party
made
a
detour
of
nearly
five
miles
keeping
behind
the
crest
of
a
hill
we
charged
down
upon
the
buffaloes
at
full
gallop
and
just
then
the
other
party
emerged
from
their
concealment
and
witnessed
the
exciting
chase
the
buffaloes
started
off
in
a
line
single
file
fitzhugh
after
a
lively
gallop
led
us
all
and
soon
came
alongside
the
rear
buffalo
at
which
he
fired
the
animal
faltered
and
then
with
another
shot
fitzhugh
brought
him
to
the
ground
crosby
dashed
by
him
and
leveled
another
of
the
herd
while
livingston
dropped
a
third
those
who
were
not
directly
engaged
in
the
hunt
now
came
up
and
congratulated
the
men
upon
their
success
and
fitzhugh
was
at
once
hailed
as
the
winner
of
the
buffalo
cup
while
all
sympathized
with
hecksher
whose
chance
had
been
the
best
at
the
start
but
who
lost
by
reason
of
his
horse
falling
and
rolling
over
him
the
hunt
being
over
the
column
moved
forward
on
its
march
passing
through
a
town
several
miles
in
extent
these
animals
are
found
throughout
the
plains
living
together
in
a
sort
of
society
their
numberless
burrows
in
their
towns
adjoin
each
other
so
that
great
care
is
necessary
in
riding
through
these
places
as
the
ground
is
so
undermined
as
often
to
fall
in
under
the
weight
of
a
horse
around
the
entrance
to
their
holes
the
ground
is
piled
up
almost
a
foot
high
on
these
little
elevations
the
sit
upon
their
hind
legs
chattering
to
each
other
and
observing
whatever
passes
on
the
plains
they
will
permit
a
person
to
approach
quite
near
but
when
they
have
viewed
him
closely
they
dive
into
their
dens
with
wonderful
quickness
they
are
difficult
to
kill
and
if
hit
generally
succeed
in
crawling
underground
before
they
can
be
captured
rattlesnakes
and
small
owls
are
generally
found
in
great
numbers
in
the
towns
and
live
in
the
same
holes
with
the
dogs
on
friendly
terms
a
few
of
the
were
killed
and
were
found
to
be
very
palatable
eating
illustration
village
a
short
distance
beyond
the
dog
town
we
discovered
a
settlement
of
five
white
men
who
proved
to
be
the
two
clifford
brothers
arthur
ruff
dick
seymour
and
john
nelson
the
latter
already
referred
to
in
these
pages
each
of
them
had
a
squaw
wife
and
numerous
children
living
in
tents
of
buffalo
skins
they
owned
a
herd
of
horses
and
mules
and
a
few
cattle
and
had
cultivated
a
small
piece
of
land
their
principal
occupation
was
hunting
and
they
had
a
large
number
of
buffalo
hides
which
they
had
tanned
in
the
indian
manner
upon
reaching
pleasant
valley
on
medicine
creek
our
party
divided
into
two
detachments
one
hunting
along
the
bank
of
the
stream
for
elk
or
deer
and
the
other
remaining
with
the
main
body
of
the
escort
the
elk
hunters
met
with
no
success
whatever
but
the
others
ran
across
plenty
of
buffaloes
and
nearly
everybody
killed
one
or
more
before
the
day
was
over
lawrence
jerome
made
an
excellent
shot
while
riding
in
an
ambulance
he
killed
a
buffalo
which
attempted
to
cross
the
line
of
march
at
about
four
we
arrived
at
mitchell
fork
of
the
medicine
having
traveled
miles
during
that
day
and
there
we
went
into
camp
calling
it
camp
jack
hayes
in
honor
of
lieutenant
hayes
on
the
next
morning
the
we
moved
out
of
camp
at
eight
the
party
was
very
successful
through
the
day
in
securing
game
hecksher
fitzhugh
livingston
and
lieutenant
hayes
and
in
fact
all
did
good
shooting
lawrence
jerome
persuaded
me
to
let
him
ride
buckskin
joe
the
best
buffalo
horse
in
the
whole
outfit
and
on
his
back
he
did
wonders
among
the
buffaloes
leonard
jerome
bennett
and
rogers
also
were
very
successful
in
buffalo
hunting
our
camp
of
this
night
was
named
camp
asch
to
commemorate
our
surgeon
asch
the
evening
was
pleasantly
spent
around
the
camp
fires
in
relating
the
adventures
of
the
day
upon
crossing
the
republican
river
on
the
morning
of
the
we
came
upon
an
immense
number
of
buffaloes
scattered
over
the
country
in
every
direction
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
and
all
had
an
opportunity
to
do
as
much
hunting
as
they
wished
the
wagons
and
troops
moved
slowly
along
in
the
direction
of
the
next
camp
while
the
hunters
went
off
separately
or
by
twos
and
threes
in
different
directions
and
all
were
rewarded
with
abundant
success
lawrence
jerome
however
had
his
career
suddenly
checked
he
had
dismounted
to
make
a
steady
and
careful
shot
and
thoughtlessly
let
go
of
the
bridle
the
buffalo
failing
to
take
a
tumble
as
he
ought
to
have
done
started
off
at
a
lively
gait
followed
by
buckskin
joe
the
horse
being
determined
to
do
some
hunting
on
his
own
account
the
last
seen
of
him
he
was
a
little
ahead
of
the
buffalo
and
gaining
slightly
leaving
his
late
rider
to
his
own
reflections
and
the
prospect
of
a
tramp
his
desolate
condition
was
soon
discovered
and
another
horse
warranted
not
to
run
under
any
provocation
was
sent
to
him
it
maybe
stated
here
that
three
days
afterwards
as
i
subsequently
learned
buckskin
joe
all
saddled
and
bridled
turned
up
at
fort
mcpherson
we
pitched
our
tents
for
the
night
in
a
charming
spot
on
the
bank
of
beaver
creek
the
game
was
so
abundant
that
we
remained
there
one
day
this
stopping
place
was
called
camp
cody
in
honor
of
the
humble
servant
the
next
day
was
spent
in
hunting
coyotes
elks
antelopes
and
wild
turkeys
we
had
a
splendid
dinner
as
will
be
seen
from
the
following
bill
of
fare
soup
buffalo

this
i
considered
a
pretty
square
meal
for
a
party
of
hunters
and
everybody
did
ample
justice
to
it
in
the
evening
a
was
held
at
which
i
presided
as
chief
justice
we
tried
one
of
the
gentlemen
for
aiding
and
abetting
in
the
loss
of
a
government
horse
and
for
having
something
to
do
with
the
mysterious
disappearance
of
a
colt
pistol
he
was
charged
also
with
snoring
in
a
manner
that
was
regarded
as
fiendish
and
with
committing
a
variety
of
other
less
offenses
too
numerous
to
mention
the
accused
made
a
feeble
defense
as
to
the
pistol
and
claimed
that
instead
of
losing
a
government
horse
the
fact
was
that
the
horse
had
lost
him
his
statements
were
all
regarded
as
too
thin
and
finally
failing
to
prove
good
character
he
confessed
all
and
threw
himself
upon
the
mercy
of
the
court
the
culprit
was
lawrence
jerome
as
chief
justice
i
delivered
the
opinion
of
the
court
which
my
modesty
does
not
prevent
me
from
saying
was
done
in
an
able
and
dignified
manner
as
an
act
of
clemency
i
suspended
judgment
for
the
time
being
remarking
that
while
the
camp
fire
held
out
to
burn
the
vilest
sinner
might
return
and
in
hope
of
the
accused
amendment
i
would
defer
pronouncing
sentence
the
trial
afforded
its
considerable
amusement
and
gave
me
a
splendid
opportunity
to
display
the
legal
knowledge
which
i
had
acquired
while
acting
as
justice
of
the
peace
at
fort
mcpherson
on
the
morning
of
the
the
command
crossed
the
south
beaver
distant
nine
miles
from
camp
cody
and
then
striking
a
fair
road
we
made
a
rapid
march
until
we
reached
our
camp
on
short
nose
or
prairie
dog
creek
about
after
having
made
miles
the
remainder
of
the
afternoon
was
spent
in
hunting
buffaloes
and
turkeys
camp
stager
was
the
name
given
to
this
place
in
honor
of
general
stager
of
the
western
union
telegraph
company
the
next
day
we
made
a
march
of
miles
and
then
halted
at
about
on
the
north
solomon
river
this
day
we
killed
three
buffaloes
two
antelopes
two
raccoons
and
three
teal
ducks
near
our
camp
which
we
named
camp
leonard
jerome
was
a
beaver
dam
some
six
feet
high
and
twenty
yards
wide
it
was
near
the
junction
of
two
streams
and
formed
a
pond
of
at
least
four
acres
on
the
we
traveled
miles
and
during
the
march
nine
turkeys
two
rabbits
and
three
or
four
buffaloes
were
killed
we
went
into
camp
on
the
bank
of
the
south
fork
of
the
solomon
river
and
called
the
place
camp
sam
johnson
we
were
now
but
miles
from
fort
hays
the
point
at
which
general
sheridan
and
his
guests
expected
to
strike
the
kansas
pacific
railway
and
thence
return
home
that
evening
i
volunteered
to
ride
to
fort
hays
and
meet
the
party
next
day
bringing
with
me
all
the
letters
that
might
be
at
the
post
taking
the
best
horse
in
the
command
i
started
out
expecting
to
make
the
trip
in
about
four
hours
the
next
morning
the
command
got
an
early
start
and
traveled
thirty
miles
to
saline
river
where
they
made
their
last
camp
on
the
plains
as
some
of
the
party
were
attacking
a
herd
of
buffaloes
i
rode
in
from
fort
hays
and
got
into
the
middle
of
the
herd
and
killed
a
buffalo
or
two
before
the
hunters
observed
me
i
brought
a
large
number
of
letters
which
proved
welcome
reading
matter
in
the
evening
we
gathered
around
the
for
the
last
time
the
duty
of
naming
the
camp
which
was
called
camp
davies
having
been
duly
performed
we
all
united
in
making
that
night
the
pleasantest
of
all
that
we
had
spent
together
we
had
eloquent
speeches
songs
and
interesting
anecdotes
i
was
called
upon
and
entertained
the
gentlemen
with
some
lively
indian
stories
the
excursionists
reached
fort
hays
distant
fifteen
miles
on
the
morning
of
october
where
we
pitched
our
tents
for
the
last
time
and
named
the
camp
in
honor
of
hecksher
that
same
afternoon
general
sheridan
and
his
guests
took
the
train
for
the
east
after
bidding
major
browa
lieutenant
hayes
and
myself
a
hearty
and
expressing
themselves
as
greatly
pleased
with
their
hunt
and
the
manner
in
which
they
had
been
escorted
and
guided
it
will
be
proper
and
fair
to
state
here
that
general
davies
afterwards
wrote
an
interesting
account
of
this
hunt
and
published
it
in
a
neat
volume
of
pages
under
the
title
of
ten
days
on
the
plains
i
would
have
inserted
the
volume
bodily
in
this
book
were
it
not
for
the
fact
that
the
general
has
spoken
in
a
rather
too
complimentary
manner
of
me
however
i
have
taken
the
liberty
in
this
chapter
to
condense
from
the
little
volume
and
in
some
places
i
have
used
the
identical
language
of
general
davies
without
quoting
the
same
in
fact
to
do
the
general
justice
i
ought
to
close
this
chapter
with
several
lines
of
quotation
marks
to
be
pretty
generally
distributed
by
the
reader
throughout
my
account
of
our
ten
days
hunt
soon
after
the
departure
of
general
sheridan
party
we
returned
to
fort
mcpherson
and
found
general
carr
about
to
start
out
on
a
twenty
scout
not
so
much
for
the
purpose
of
finding
indians
but
more
for
the
object
of
taking
some
friends
on
a
hunt
his
guests
were
a
couple
of
englishmen
whose
names
i
can
not
now
remember
and
mccarthy
of
syracuse
new
york
who
was
a
relative
of
general
emory
the
command
consisted
of
three
companies
of
the
fifth
cavalry
one
company
of
pawnee
indians
and
wagons
of
course
i
was
called
on
to
accompany
the
expedition
one
day
after
we
had
been
out
from
the
post
for
some
little
time
i
was
hunting
on
deer
creek
in
company
with
mccarthy
about
eight
miles
from
the
command
i
had
been
wishing
for
several
days
to
play
a
joke
on
him
and
had
arranged
a
plan
with
captain
lute
north
to
carry
it
into
execution
i
had
informed
north
at
about
what
time
we
would
be
on
deer
creek
and
it
was
agreed
that
he
should
appear
in
the
vicinity
with
some
of
his
pawnees
who
were
to
throw
their
blankets
around
them
and
come
dashing
down
upon
us
firing
and
whooping
in
true
indian
style
while
he
was
to
either
conceal
or
disguise
himself
this
programme
was
faithfully
and
completely
carried
out
i
had
been
talking
about
indians
to
mccarthy
and
he
had
become
considerably
excited
when
just
as
we
turned
a
bend
of
the
creek
we
saw
not
half
a
mile
from
us
about
twenty
indians
who
instantly
started
for
us
on
a
gallop
firing
their
guns
and
yelling
at
the
top
of
their
voices
mccarthy
shall
we
dismount
and
fight
or
run
said
i
he
did
wait
to
reply
but
wheeling
his
horse
started
at
full
speed
down
the
creek
losing
his
hat
and
dropping
his
gun
away
he
went
never
once
looking
back
to
see
if
he
was
being
pursued
i
tried
to
stop
him
by
yelling
at
him
and
saying
that
it
was
all
right
as
the
indians
were
pawnees
unfortunately
he
did
not
hear
me
but
kept
straight
on
not
stopping
his
horse
until
he
reached
the
camp
illustration
mccarthy
fright
i
knew
that
he
would
tell
general
carr
that
the
indians
had
jumped
him
and
that
the
general
would
soon
start
out
with
the
troops
so
as
soon
as
the
pawnees
rode
up
to
me
i
told
them
to
remain
there
while
i
went
after
my
friend
i
rode
after
him
as
fast
as
possible
but
he
had
arrived
at
the
command
some
time
before
me
and
when
i
got
there
the
general
had
as
i
had
suspected
he
would
do
ordered
out
two
companies
of
cavalry
to
go
in
pursuit
of
the
indians
i
told
the
general
that
the
indians
were
only
some
pawnees
who
had
been
out
hunting
and
that
they
had
merely
played
a
joke
upon
us
i
forgot
to
inform
him
that
i
had
put
up
the
trick
but
as
he
was
always
fond
of
a
good
joke
himself
he
did
not
get
very
angry
i
had
picked
up
mccarthy
hat
and
gun
which
i
returned
to
him
and
it
was
some
time
afterwards
before
he
discovered
who
was
at
the
bottom
of
the
affair
when
we
returned
to
fort
mcpherson
we
found
there
royal
buck
whose
father
had
been
killed
with
his
entire
party
by
pawnee
killer
band
of
indians
on
the
beaver
creek
he
had
a
letter
from
the
commanding
officer
of
the
department
requesting
that
he
be
furnished
with
an
escort
to
go
in
search
of
the
remains
of
his
father
and
the
party
two
companies
of
cavalry
were
sent
with
him
and
i
accompanied
them
as
guide
as
the
old
squaw
which
we
had
captured
and
of
which
mention
is
made
in
a
previous
chapter
could
not
exactly
tell
us
the
place
on
beaver
creek
where
the
party
had
been
killed
we
searched
the
country
over
for
two
days
and
discovered
no
signs
of
the
murdered
men
at
last
however
our
efforts
were
rewarded
with
success
we
found
pieces
of
their
wagons
and
among
other
things
an
old
letter
or
two
which
buck
recognized
as
his
father
handwriting
we
then
discovered
some
of
the
remains
which
we
buried
but
nothing
further
it
was
now
getting
late
in
the
fall
and
we
accordingly
returned
to
fort
mcpherson
a
short
time
after
this
the
fifth
cavalry
was
ordered
to
arizona
a
not
very
desirable
country
to
soldier
in
i
had
become
greatly
attached
to
the
officers
of
the
regiment
having
been
continually
with
them
for
over
three
years
and
had
about
made
up
my
mind
to
accompany
them
when
a
letter
was
received
from
general
sheridan
instructing
the
commanding
officer
not
to
take
cody
with
him
and
saying
that
i
was
to
remain
in
my
old
position
in
a
few
days
the
command
left
for
its
destination
taking
the
cars
at
mcpherson
station
where
i
bade
my
old
friends
adieu
during
the
next
few
weeks
i
had
but
little
to
do
as
the
post
was
garrisoned
by
infantry
awaiting
the
arrival
of
the
third
cavalry

finding
the
remains

chapter
xxv
hunting
with
a
grand
duke
about
the
first
of
january
general
forsyth
and
asch
of
sheridan
staff
came
out
to
fort
mcpherson
to
make
preparations
for
a
big
buffalo
hunt
for
the
grand
duke
alexis
of
russia
and
as
this
was
to
be
no
ordinary
affair
these
officers
had
been
sent
by
general
sheridan
to
have
all
the
necessary
arrangements
perfected
by
the
time
the
grand
duke
should
arrive
they
learned
from
me
that
there
were
plenty
of
buffaloes
in
the
vicinity
and
especially
on
the
red
willow
sixty
miles
distant
they
said
they
would
like
to
go
over
on
the
red
willow
and
pick
out
a
suitable
place
for
the
camp
they
also
inquired
the
location
of
the
spotted
tail
sioux
indians
spotted
tail
had
permission
from
the
government
to
hunt
the
buffalo
with
his
people
during
the
winter
in
the
republican
river
country
it
was
my
opinion
that
they
were
located
somewhere
on
the
frenchman
fork
about
one
hundred
and
fifty
miles
from
fort
mcpherson
general
sheridan
commissioners
informed
me
that
he
wished
me
to
visit
spotted
tail
camp
and
induce
about
one
hundred
of
the
leading
warriors
and
chiefs
to
come
to
the
point
where
it
should
be
decided
to
locate
the
alexis
hunting
camp
and
to
be
there
by
the
time
the
grand
duke
should
arrive
so
that
he
could
see
a
body
of
american
indians
and
observe
the
manner
in
which
they
killed
buffaloes
the
indians
would
also
be
called
upon
to
give
a
grand
war
dance
in
honor
of
the
distinguished
visitor
next
morning
general
forsyth
and
asch
accompanied
by
captain
hays
who
had
been
left
at
fort
mcpherson
in
charge
of
the
fifth
cavalry
horses
taking
an
ambulance
and
a
light
wagon
to
carry
their
tents
and
provisions
sufficient
to
last
them
two
or
three
days
started
under
my
guidance
with
a
small
escort
for
red
willow
creek
arriving
there
at
night
the
next
day
we
selected
a
pleasant
camping
place
on
a
little
knoll
in
the
valley
of
the
red
willow
general
forsyth
and
his
party
returned
to
the
post
the
next
day
while
i
left
for
spotted
tail
camp
the
weather
was
very
cold
and
i
found
my
journey
by
no
means
a
pleasant
one
as
i
was
obliged
to
camp
out
with
only
my
saddle
blankets
and
besides
there
was
more
or
less
danger
from
the
indians
themselves
for
although
spotted
tail
himself
was
friendly
i
was
afraid
i
might
have
difficulty
in
getting
into
his
camp
i
was
liable
at
any
moment
to
run
into
a
party
of
his
young
men
who
might
be
out
hunting
and
as
i
had
many
enemies
among
the
sioux
i
would
be
running
considerable
risk
in
meeting
them
at
the
end
of
the
first
day
i
camped
on
stinking
water
a
tributary
of
the
frenchman
fork
where
i
built
a
little
fire
in
the
timber
but
it
was
so
very
cold
i
was
not
able
to
sleep
much
getting
an
early
start
in
the
morning
i
followed
up
the
frenchman
fork
and
late
in
the
afternoon
i
could
see
from
the
fresh
horse
tracks
and
from
the
dead
buffaloes
lying
here
and
there
recently
killed
that
i
was
nearing
spotted
camp
i
rode
on
for
a
few
miles
further
and
then
hiding
my
horse
in
a
low
ravine
i
crawled
up
a
high
hill
where
i
obtained
a
good
view
of
the
country
i
could
see
for
four
or
five
miles
up
the
creek
and
got
sight
of
a
village
and
of
two
or
three
hundred
ponies
in
its
vicinity
i
waited
until
night
came
and
then
i
succeeded
in
riding
into
the
indian
camp
unobserved
illustration
spotted
tail
i
had
seen
spotted
tail
camp
when
he
came
from
the
north
and
i
knew
the
kind
of
lodge
he
was
living
in
as
i
entered
the
village
i
wrapped
a
blanket
around
my
head
so
that
the
indians
could
not
tell
whether
i
was
a
white
or
a
red
man
in
this
way
i
rode
around
until
i
found
spotted
tail
lodge
dismounting
from
my
horse
i
opened
his
tent
door
and
looked
in
and
saw
the
old
chief
lying
on
some
robes
i
spoke
to
him
and
he
recognized
me
at
once
and
invited
me
to
enter
inside
the
lodge
i
found
a
white
man
an
old
frontiersman
todd
randall
who
was
spotted
agent
and
who
had
lived
a
great
many
years
with
the
indians
he
understood
their
language
perfectly
and
did
all
the
interpreting
for
spotted
tail
through
him
i
readily
communicated
with
the
chief
and
informed
him
of
my
errand
i
told
him
that
the
warriors
and
chiefs
would
greatly
please
general
sheridan
if
they
would
meet
him
in
about
ten
sleeps
at
the
old
government
crossing
of
the
red
willow
i
further
informed
him
that
there
was
a
great
chief
from
across
the
water
who
was
coming
there
to
visit
him
spotted
tail
replied
that
he
would
be
very
glad
to
go
that
the
next
morning
he
would
call
his
people
together
and
select
those
who
would
accompany
him
i
told
spotted
tail
how
i
had
entered
his
camp
he
replied
that
i
had
acted
wisely
that
although
his
people
were
friendly
yet
some
of
his
young
men
had
a
grudge
against
me
and
i
might
have
had
difficulty
with
them
had
i
met
them
away
from
the
village
he
directed
his
squaw
to
get
me
something
to
eat
and
ordered
that
my
horse
be
taken
care
of
and
upon
his
invitation
i
spent
the
remainder
of
the
night
in
his
lodge
next
morning
the
chiefs
and
warriors
assembled
according
to
orders
and
to
them
was
stated
the
object
of
my
visit
they
were
asked
do
you
know
who
this
man
is
yes
we
know
him
well
replied
one
that
is
that
being
my
name
among
the
sioux
which
translated
means
long
hair
that
is
our
old
enemy
a
great
many
of
the
indians
who
were
with
spotted
tail
at
this
time
had
been
driven
out
of
the
republican
country
that
is
he
said
spotted
tail
i
want
all
my
people
to
be
kind
to
him
and
treat
him
as
my
friend
i
noticed
that
several
of
them
were
looking
daggers
at
me
they
appeared
as
if
they
wished
to
raise
my
hair
then
and
there
spotted
tail
motioned
and
i
followed
him
into
his
lodge
and
thereupon
the
indians
dispersed
having
the
assurance
of
spotted
tail
that
none
of
the
young
men
would
follow
me
i
started
back
for
the
red
willow
arriving
the
second
night
there
i
found

company
of
the

duke
alexis
asked
me
a
great
many
questions
as
to
how
we
shot
buffaloes
and
what
kind
of
a
gun
or
pistol
we
used
and
if
he
was
going
to
have
a
good
horse
i
told
him
that
he
was
to
have
my
celebrated
buffalo
horse
buckskin
joe
and
when
we
went
into
a
buffalo
herd
all
he
would
have
to
do
was
to
sit
on
the
horse
back
and
fire
away
at
nine
next
morning
we
were
all
in
our
saddles
and
in
a
few
minutes
were
galloping
over
the
prairies
in
search
of
a
buffalo
herd
we
had
not
gone
far
before
we
observed
a
herd
some
distance
ahead
of
us
crossing
our
way
after
that
we
proceeded
cautiously
so
as
to
keep
out
of
sight
until
we
were
ready
to
make
a
charge
of
course
the
main
thing
was
to
give
alexis
the
first
chance
and
the
best
shot
at
the
buffaloes
and
when
all
was
in
readiness
we
dashed
over
a
little
knoll
that
had
hidden
us
from
view
and
in
a
few
minutes
we
were
among
them
alexis
at
first
preferred
to
use
his
pistol
instead
of
a
gun
he
fired
six
shots
from
this
weapon
at
buffaloes
only
twenty
feet
away
from
him
but
as
he
shot
wildly
not
one
of
his
bullets
took
effect
riding
up
to
his
side
and
seeing
that
his
weapon
was
empty
i
exchanged
pistols
with
him
he
again
fired
six
shots
without
dropping
a
buffalo
seeing
that
the
animals
were
bound
to
make
their
escape
without
his
killing
one
of
them
unless
he
had
a
better
weapon
i
rode
up
to
him
gave
him
my
old
reliable
lucretia
and
told
him
to
urge
his
horse
close
to
the
buffaloes
and
i
would
then
give
him
the
word
when
to
shoot
at
the
same
time
i
gave
old
buckskin
joe
a
blow
with
my
whip
and
with
a
few
jumps
the
horse
carried
the
grand
duke
to
within
about
ten
feet
of
a
big
buffalo
bull
now
is
your
time
said
i
he
fired
and
down
went
the
buffalo
the
grand
duke
stopped
his
horse
dropped
his
gun
on
the
ground
and
commenced
waving
his
hat
when
his
came
galloping
up
he
began
talking
to
them
in
a
tongue
which
i
could
not
understand
presently
general
sheridan
joined
the
group
and
the
ambulances
were
brought
up
very
soon
the
corks
began
to
fly
from
the
champagne
bottles
in
honor
of
the
grand
duke
alexis
who
had
killed
the
first
buffalo
it
was
reported
in
a
great
many
of
the
newspapers
that
i
shot
the
first
buffalo
for
alexis
while
in
some
it
was
stated
that
i
held
the
buffalo
while
his
royal
highness
killed
it
but
the
way
i
have
related
the
affair
is
the
correct
version
it
was
thought
that
we
had
had
about
sport
enough
for
one
day
and
accordingly
i
was
directed
by
general
sheridan
to
guide
the
party
back
to
camp
and
we
were
soon
on
our
way
thither
several
of
the
party
however
concluded
to
have
a
little
hunt
on
their
own
account
and
presently
we
saw
them
galloping
over
the
prairie
in
different
directions
in
pursuit
of
buffaloes
while
we
were
crossing
a
deep
ravine
on
our
way
to
camp
we
ran
into
a
small
band
of
buffaloes
that
had
been
frightened
by
some
of
the
hunters
as
they
rushed
past
us
not
more
than
thirty
yards
distant
alexis
raised
his
pistol
fired
and
killed
a
buffalo
cow
it
was
either
an
extraordinary
good
shot
or
a
scratch
probably
the
latter
for
it
surprised
the
grand
duke
as
well
as
everybody
else
we
gave
him
three
cheers
and
when
the
ambulance
came
up
we
took
a
pull
at
the
champagne
in
honor
of
the
grand
duke
success
i
was
in
hopes
that
he
would
kill
five
or
six
more
buffaloes
before
we
reached
camp
especially
if
a
basket
of
champagne
was
to
be
opened
every
time
he
dropped
one
general
sheridan
directed
me
to
take
care
of
the
hides
and
heads
of
the
buffaloes
which
alexis
had
killed
as
the
duke
wished
to
keep
them
as
souvenirs
of
the
hunt
i
also
cut
out
the
choice
meat
from
the
cow
and
brought
it
into
camp
and
that
night
at
supper
alexis
had
the
pleasure
of
dining
on
broiled
buffalo
steak
obtained
from
the
animal
which
he
had
shot
himself
we
remained
at
this
camp
two
or
three
days
during
which
we
hunted
most
of
the
time
the
grand
duke
himself
killing
eight
buffaloes
one
day
alexis
desired
to
see
how
the
indians
hunted
buffaloes
and
killed
them
with
bow
and
arrow
so
spotted
tail
selecting
some
of
his
best
hunters
had
them
surround
a
herd
and
bring
the
animals
down
not
only
with
arrows
but
with
lances
the
grand
duke
was
told
to
follow
upon
the
heels
of
one
celebrated
indian
hunter
whose
name
was
two
lance
and
watch
him
bring
down
the
game
for
this
chief
had
the
reputation
of
being
able
to
send
an
arrow
through
and
through
the
body
of
a
buffalo
upon
this
occasion
he
did
not
belie
his
reputation
for
he
sent
an
arrow
a
buffalo
which
fell
dead
at
the
shot
and
the
arrow
was
given
to
alexis
as
a
souvenir
of
his
hunt
on
the
american
plains
illustration
two
lance
killing
a
buffalo
when
the
grand
duke
was
satisfied
with
the
sport
orders
were
given
for
the
return
to
the
railroad
the
conveyance
provided
for
the
grand
duke
and
general
sheridan
was
a
heavy
open
carriage
or
rather
an
irish
and
it
was
drawn
by
four
spirited
cavalry
horses
which
were
not
much
used
to
the
harness
the
driver
was
bill
reed
an
old
overland
stage
driver
and
wagon
master
on
our
way
in
the
grand
duke
frequently
expressed
his
admiration
of
the
skillful
manner
in
which
reed
handled
the
reins
general
sheridan
informed
the
duke
that
i
also
had
been
a
in
the
rocky
mountains
and
thereupon
his
royal
highness
expressed
a
desire
to
see
me
drive
i
was
in
advance
at
the
time
and
general
sheridan
sang
out
to
me
cody
get
in
here
and
show
the
duke
how
you
can
drive
reed
will
exchange
places
with
you
and
ride
your
horse
all
right
general
said
i
and
in
a
few
moments
i
had
the
reins
and
we
were
rattling
away
over
the
prairie
when
we
were
approaching
medicine
creek
general
sheridan
said
shake
up
a
little
bill
and
give
us
some
i
gave
the
horses
a
crack
or
two
of
the
whip
and
they
started
off
at
a
very
rapid
gait
they
had
a
light
load
to
pull
and
kept
increasing
their
speed
at
every
jump
and
i
found
it
difficult
to
hold
them
they
fairly
flew
over
the
ground
and
at
last
we
reached
a
steep
hill
or
divide
which
led
down
into
the
valley
of
the
medicine
there
was
no
brake
on
the
wagon
and
the
horses
were
not
much
on
the
i
saw
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
stop
them
all
i
could
do
was
to
keep
them
straight
in
the
track
and
let
them
go
it
down
the
hill
for
three
miles
which
distance
i
believe
was
made
in
about
six
minutes
every
once
in
a
while
the
hind
wheels
would
strike
a
rut
and
take
a
bound
and
not
touch
the
ground
again
for
fifteen
or
twenty
feet
the
duke
and
the
general
were
kept
rather
busy
in
holding
their
positions
on
the
seats
and
when
they
saw
that
i
was
keeping
the
horses
straight
in
the
road
they
seemed
to
enjoy
the
dash
which
we
were
making
i
was
unable
to
stop
the
team
until
they
ran
into
the
camp
where
we
were
to
obtain
a
fresh
relay
and
there
i
succeeded
in
checking
them
the
grand
duke
said
he
did
want
any
more
of
that
kind
of
driving
as
he
preferred
to
go
a
little
slower
on
arriving
at
the
railroad
the
duke
invited
me
into
his
car
and
made
me
some
valuable
presents
at
the
same
time
giving
me
a
cordial
invitation
to
visit
him
if
ever
i
should
come
to
his
country
general
sheridan
took
occasion
to
remind
me
of
an
invitation
to
visit
new
york
which
i
had
received
from
some
of
the
gentlemen
who
accompanied
the
general
on
the
hunt
from
fort
mcpherson
to
hays
city
in
september
of
the
previous
year
said
he
you
will
never
have
a
better
opportunity
to
accept
that
invitation
than
now
i
have
had
a
talk
with
general
ord
concerning
you
and
he
will
give
you
a
leave
of
absence
whenever
you
are
ready
to
start
write
a
letter
to
general
stager
of
chicago
that
you
are
now
prepared
to
accept
the
invitation
and
he
will
send
you
a
pass
thanking
the
general
for
his
kindness
i
then
bade
him
and
the
grand
duke
and
soon
their
train
was
out
of
sight
chapter
xxvi
general
ord
commanding
the
department
of
the
platte
at
the
time
and
who
had
been
out
on
the
alexis
hunt
had
some
business
to
attend
to
at
fort
mcpherson
and
i
accepted
his
invitation
to
ride
over
to
the
post
with
him
in
an
ambulance
on
the
way
thither
he
asked
me
how
i
would
like
to
have
an
officer
commission
in
the
regular
army
he
said
that
general
sheridan
and
himself
had
had
some
conversation
about
the
matter
and
if
i
wanted
a
commission
one
could
easily
be
procured
for
me
i
thanked
general
ord
for
his
kindness
and
said
that
although
an
commission
in
the
regular
army
was
a
tempting
prize
yet
i
preferred
to
remain
in
the
position
i
was
then
holding
he
concluded
by
stating
that
if
at
any
time
i
should
wish
a
commission
all
that
i
would
have
to
do
to
secure
it
would
be
to
inform
him
of
my
desire
having
determined
to
visit
new
york
i
acted
upon
general
suggestion
and
wrote
to
general
stager
from
whom
in
a
few
days
i
received
my
railroad
passes
obtaining
thirty
days
leave
of
absence
from
the
department
i
struck
out
for
the
east
on
arriving
in
chicago
in
february
i
was
met
at
the
dépôt
by
colonel
sheridan
who
said
that
his
brother
the
general
had
not
yet
returned
but
had
sent
word
that
i
was
to
be
his
and
the
colonel
guest
at
their
house
while
i
remained
in
chicago
i
spent
two
or
three
days
very
pleasantly
in
the
great
city
of
the
west
meeting
several
of
the
gentlemen
who
had
been
out
on
the
sheridan
hunt
in
september
general
stager
colonel
wilson
editor
of
the
sam
johnson
general
rucker
and
others
by
all
of
whom
i
was
most
cordially
received
and
well
entertained
i
was
introduced
to
quite
a
number
of
the
best
people
of
the
city
and
was
invited
to
several
swell
dinners
i
also
accompanied
general
sheridan
who
meantime
had
returned
to
the
city
to
a
ball
at
riverside
an
aristocratic
suburb
illustration
an
embarrassing
situation
on
this
occasion
i
became
so
embarrassed
that
it
was
more
difficult
for
me
to
face
the
throng
of
beautiful
ladies
than
it
would
have
been
to
confront
a
hundred
hostile
indians
this
was
my
first
trip
to
the
east
and
i
had
not
yet
become
accustomed
to
being
stared
at
and
besides
this
the
hundreds
of
questions
which
i
was
called
upon
to
answer
further
embarrassed
and
perplexed
me
according
to
the
route
laid
out
for
me
by
general
stager
i
was
to
stop
at
niagara
falls
buffalo
and
rochester
on
my
way
to
new
york
and
he
provided
me
with
all
the
necessary
railroad
passes
just
as
i
was
about
to
leave
chicago
i
met
professor
henry
a
ward
of
rochester
for
whom
during
the
previous
year
or
two
i
had
collected
a
large
number
of
specimens
of
wild
animals
he
was
on
his
way
to
rochester
and
kindly
volunteered
to
act
as
my
guide
until
we
reached
that
point
we
spent
one
day
in
viewing
the
wonders
of
niagara
and
i
stopped
one
day
at
rochester
and
was
shown
the
beauties
of
that
handsome
city
by
professor
ward
and
i
had
the
honor
of
receiving
an
invitation
to
dine
with
the
mayor
on
arriving
at
new
york
i
was
met
at
the
dépôt
by
hecksher
who
had
been
appointed
as
a
committee
of
one
to
escort
me
to
the
union
club
where
james
gordon
bennett
leonard
jerome
and
others
were
to
give
me
an
informal
reception
and
where
i
was
to
make
my
headquarters
during
my
visit
in
the
great
metropolis
i
had
an
elegant
dinner
at
the
club
rooms
with
the
gentlemen
who
had
been
out
on
the
september
hunt
and
other
members
of
the
club
after
dinner
in
company
with
hecksher
who
acted
as
my
guide
i
started
out
on
the
trail
of
my
friend
ned
buntline
whom
we
found
at
the
brevoort
place
hotel
he
was
delighted
to
see
me
and
insisted
on
my
becoming
his
guest
he
would
listen
to
no
excuses
and
on
introducing
me
to
overton
blair
proprietors
of
the
brevoort
they
also
gave
me
a
pressing
invitation
to
make
my
home
at
their
house
i
finally
compromised
the
matter
by
agreeing
to
divide
my
time
between
the
union
club
the
brevoort
house
and
ned
buntline
quarters
the
next
few
days
i
spent
in
viewing
the
sights
of
new
york
everything
being
new
and
startling
convincing
me
that
as
yet
i
had
seen
but
a
small
portion
of
the
world
i
received
numerous
dinner
invitations
as
well
as
invitations
to
visit
different
places
of
amusement
and
interest
but
as
they
came
in
so
thick
and
fast
i
soon
became
badly
demoralized
and
confused
i
found
i
had
accepted
invitations
to
dine
at
half
a
dozen
or
more
houses
on
the
same
day
and
at
the
same
hour
james
gordon
bennett
had
prepared
a
dinner
for
me
at
which
quite
a
large
number
of
his
friends
were
to
be
present
but
owing
to
my
confusion
arising
from
the
many
other
invitations
i
had
received
i
forgot
all
about
it
and
dined
elsewhere
this
was
a
bad
break
but
i
did
not
learn
of
my
mistake
until
next
day
when
at
the
union
club
house
several
gentlemen
among
them
lawrence
jerome
inquired
where
in
the
world
i
had
been
and
why
i
had
not
put
in
an
appearance
at
bennett
dinner
they
said
that
bennett
had
taken
great
pains
to
give
me
a
splendid
reception
that
the
party
had
waited
till
nine
for
me
and
that
my
caused
considerable
disappointment
i
apologized
as
well
as
i
could
by
saying
that
i
had
been
out
on
a
scout
and
had
got
lost
and
had
forgotten
all
about
the
dinner
and
expressed
my
regret
for
the
disappointment
i
had
created
by
my
forgetfulness
august
belmont
the
banker
being
near
said
never
mind
gentlemen
i
give
cody
a
dinner
at
my
house
thank
you
sir
said
i
i
see
you
are
determined
that
i
shall
not
run
short
of
rations
while
i
am
in
the
city
i
be
there
sure
both
jerome
and
hecksher
told
me
that
i
must
not
disappoint
belmont
for
his
dinners
were
splendid
affairs
i
made
a
note
of
the
date
and
at
the
appointed
time
i
was
promptly
at
belmont
mansion
where
i
spent
a
very
enjoyable
evening
bennett
who
was
among
the
guests
having
forgiven
my
carelessness
invited
me
to
accompany
him
to
the
liederkranz
masked
ball
which
was
to
take
place
in
a
few
evenings
and
would
be
a
grand
spectacle
together
we
attended
the
ball
and
during
the
evening
i
was
well
entertained
the
dancers
kept
on
their
masks
until
midnight
and
the
merry
and
motley
throng
presented
a
brilliant
scene
moving
gracefully
beneath
the
bright
to
the
inspiriting
music
to
me
it
was
a
novel
and
entertaining
sight
and
in
many
respects
reminded
me
greatly
of
an
indian
acting
upon
the
suggestion
of
bennett
i
had
dressed
myself
in
my
buckskin
suit
and
i
naturally
attracted
considerable
attention
especially
when
i
took
part
in
the
dancing
and
exhibited
some
of
my
backwoods
steps
which
although
not
as
graceful
as
some
were
a
great
deal
more
emphatic
but
when
i
undertook
to
do
artistic
dancing
i
found
i
was
decidedly
out
of
place
in
that
crowd
and
i
accordingly
withdrew
from
the
floor
i
occasionally
passed
an
evening
at
niblo
garden
viewing
the
many
beauties
of
the
black
crook
which
was
then
having
its
long
run
under
the
management
of
jarrett
palmer
whose
acquaintance
i
had
made
and
who
extended
to
me
the
freedom
of
the
theater
ned
buntline
and
fred
maeder
had
dramatized
one
of
the
stories
which
the
former
had
written
about
me
for
the
york
the
drama
was
called
buffalo
bill
the
king
of
border
men
while
i
was
in
new
york
it
was
produced
at
the
bowery
theater
studley
an
excellent
actor
appearing
in
the
character
of
buffalo
bill
and
jones
a
fine
actress
taking
the
part
of
my
sister
a
leading
i
was
curious
to
see
how
i
would
look
when
represented
by
some
one
else
and
of
course
i
was
present
on
the
opening
night
a
private
box
having
been
reserved
for
me
the
theater
was
packed
every
seat
being
occupied
as
well
as
the
the
drama
was
played
smoothly
and
created
a
great
deal
of
enthusiasm
the
audience
upon
learning
that
the
real
buffalo
bill
was
present
gave
several
cheers
between
the
acts
and
i
was
called
on
to
come
out
on
the
stage
and
make
a
speech
freleigh
the
manager
insisted
that
i
should
comply
with
the
request
and
that
i
should
be
introduced
to
studley
i
finally
consented
and
the
next
moment
i
found
myself
standing
behind
the
footlights
and
in
front
of
an
audience
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
i
looked
up
then
down
then
on
each
side
and
everywhere
i
saw
a
sea
of
human
faces
and
thousands
of
eyes
all
staring
at
me
i
confess
that
i
felt
very
much
embarrassed
never
more
so
in
my
life
and
i
knew
not
what
to
say
i
made
a
desperate
effort
and
a
few
words
escaped
me
but
what
they
were
i
could
not
for
the
life
of
me
tell
nor
could
any
one
else
in
the
house
my
utterances
were
inaudible
even
to
the
leader
of
the
orchestra
dean
who
was
sitting
only
a
few
feet
in
front
of
me
bowing
to
the
audience
i
beat
a
hasty
retreat
into
one
of
the
cañons
of
the
stage
i
never
felt
more
relieved
in
my
life
than
when
i
got
out
of
the
view
of
that
immense
crowd
that
evening
freleigh
offered
to
give
me
five
hundred
dollars
a
week
to
play
the
part
of
buffalo
bill
myself
i
thought
that
he
was
certainly
joking
especially
as
he
had
witnessed
my
awkward
performance
but
when
he
assured
me
that
he
was
in
earnest
i
told
him
that
it
would
be
useless
for
me
to
attempt
anything
of
the
kind
for
i
never
could
talk
to
a
crowd
of
people
like
that
even
if
it
was
to
save
my
neck
and
that
he
might
as
well
try
to
make
an
actor
out
of
a
government
mule
i
thanked
him
for
the
generous
offer
which
i
had
to
decline
owing
to
a
lack
of
confidence
in
myself
or
as
some
people
might
express
it
i
did
have
the
requisite
cheek
to
undertake
a
thing
of
that
sort
the
play
of
buffalo
bill
had
a
very
successful
run
of
six
or
eight
weeks
and
was
afterwards
produced
in
all
the
principal
cities
of
the
country
everywhere
being
received
with
genuine
enthusiasm
i
had
been
in
new
york
about
twenty
days
when
general
sheridan
arrived
in
the
city
i
met
him
soon
after
he
got
into
town
in
answer
to
a
question
how
i
was
enjoying
myself
i
replied
that
i
had
struck
the
best
camp
i
had
ever
seen
and
if
he
did
have
any
objections
i
would
like
to
have
my
leave
of
absence
extended
about
ten
days
this
he
willingly
did
and
then
informed
me
that
my
services
would
soon
be
required
at
fort
mcpherson
as
there
was
to
be
an
expedition
sent
out
from
that
point
at
westchester
pennsylvania
i
had
some
relatives
living
whom
i
had
never
seen
and
now
being
so
near
i
determined
to
make
them
a
visit
upon
mentioning
the
matter
to
buntline
he
suggested
that
we
should
together
take
a
trip
to
philadelphia
and
thence
run
out
to
westchester
accordingly
the
next
day
found
us
in
the
city
of
brotherly
love
and
in
a
few
hours
we
arrived
at
the
home
of
my
uncle
general
henry
guss
the
proprietor
of
the
green
tree
hotel
who
gave
us
a
cordial
reception
inviting
us
into
the
parlor
my
uncle
brought
in
the
members
of
his
family
among
them
an
elderly
lady
who
was
my
grandmother
as
he
informed
me
he
told
me
that
my
aunt
eliza
his
first
wife
was
dead
and
that
he
had
married
a
second
time
lizzie
guss
my
cousin
i
thought
was
the
most
beautiful
girl
i
had
ever
seen
they
were
all
very
anxious
to
have
us
remain
several
days
but
as
i
had
some
business
to
attend
to
in
new
york
i
was
obliged
to
return
that
day
assuring
them
however
that
i
would
visit
them
again
soon
i
bade
them
adieu
and
with
buntline
took
the
train
for
new
york
the
time
soon
arrived
for
my
departure
for
the
west
so
packing
up
my
traps
i
started
for
home
and
on
the
way
thither
i
spent
a
day
with
my
westchester
relatives
who
did
everything
in
their
power
to
entertain
me
during
my
brief
stay
with
them
chapter
xxvii
honors
upon
reaching
fort
mcpherson
i
found
that
the
third
cavalry
commanded
by
general
reynolds
had
arrived
from
arizona
in
which
territory
they
had
been
on
duty
for
some
time
and
where
they
had
acquired
quite
a
reputation
on
account
of
their
indian
fighting
qualities
shortly
after
my
return
a
small
party
of
indians
made
a
dash
on
mcpherson
station
about
five
miles
from
the
fort
killing
two
or
three
men
and
running
off
quite
a
large
number
of
horses
captain
meinhold
and
lieutenant
lawson
with
their
company
were
ordered
out
to
pursue
and
punish
the
indians
if
possible
i
was
the
guide
of
the
expedition
and
had
as
an
assistant
omohundro
better
known
as
texas
jack
and
who
was
a
scout
at
the
post
finding
the
trail
i
followed
it
for
two
days
although
it
was
difficult
trailing
because
the
had
taken
every
possible
precaution
to
conceal
their
tracks
on
the
second
day
captain
meinhold
went
into
camp
on
the
south
fork
of
the
loupe
at
a
point
where
the
trail
was
badly
scattered
six
men
were
detailed
to
accompany
me
on
a
scout
in
search
of
the
camp
of
the
fugitives
we
had
gone
but
a
short
distance
when
we
discovered
indians
camped
not
more
than
a
mile
away
with
horses
grazing
near
by
they
were
only
a
small
party
and
i
determined
to
charge
upon
them
with
my
six
men
rather
than
return
to
the
command
because
i
feared
they
would
see
us
as
we
went
back
and
then
they
would
get
away
from
us
entirely
i
asked
the
men
if
they
were
willing
to
attempt
it
and
they
replied
that
they
would
follow
me
wherever
i
would
lead
them
that
was
the
kind
of
spirit
that
pleased
me
and
we
immediately
moved
forward
on
the
enemy
getting
as
close
to
them
as
possible
without
being
seen
i
finally
gave
the
signal
to
charge
and
we
dashed
into
the
little
camp
with
a
yell
five
indians
sprang
out
of
a
willow
tepee
and
greeted
us
with
a
volley
and
we
returned
the
fire
i
was
riding
buckskin
joe
who
with
a
few
jumps
brought
me
up
to
the
tepee
followed
by
my
men
we
nearly
ran
over
the
indians
who
were
endeavoring
to
reach
their
horses
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
creek
just
as
one
was
jumping
the
narrow
stream
a
bullet
from
my
old
lucretia
overtook
him
he
never
reached
the
other
bank
but
dropped
dead
in
the
water
those
of
the
indians
who
were
guarding
the
horses
seeing
what
was
going
on
at
the
camp
came
rushing
to
the
rescue
of
their
friends
i
now
counted
thirteen
braves
but
as
we
had
already
disposed
of
two
we
had
only
eleven
to
take
care
of
the
odds
were
nearly
two
to
one
against
us
while
the
indian
reinforcements
were
approaching
the
camp
i
jumped
the
creek
with
buckskin
joe
to
meet
them
expecting
our
party
would
follow
me
but
as
they
could
not
induce
their
horses
to
make
the
leap
i
was
the
only
one
who
got
over
i
ordered
the
sergeant
to
dismount
his
men
and
leaving
one
to
hold
the
horses
to
come
over
with
the
rest
and
help
me
drive
the
indians
off
before
they
could
do
this
two
mounted
warriors
closed
in
on
me
and
were
shooting
at
short
range
i
returned
their
fire
and
had
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
one
of
them
fall
from
his
horse
at
this
moment
i
felt
blood
trickling
down
my
forehead
and
hastily
running
my
hand
through
my
hair
i
discovered
that
i
had
received
a
scalp
wound
the
indian
who
had
shot
me
was
not
more
than
ten
yards
away
and
when
he
saw
his
partner
tumble
from
his
saddle
he
turned
to
run
by
this
time
the
soldiers
had
crossed
the
creek
to
assist
me
and
were
blazing
away
at
the
other
indians
urging
buckskin
joe
forward
i
was
soon
alongside
of
the
chap
who
had
wounded
me
when
raising
myself
in
the
stirrups
i
shot
him
through
the
head
the
reports
of
our
guns
had
been
heard
by
captain
meinhold
who
at
once
started
with
his
company
up
the
creek
to
our
aid
and
when
the
remaining
indians
whom
we
were
still
fighting
saw
these
reinforcements
coming
they
whirled
their
horses
and
fled
as
their
steeds
were
quite
fresh
they
made
their
escape
however
we
killed
six
out
of
the
thirteen
indians
and
captured
most
of
their
stolen
stock
our
loss
was
one
man
killed
and
one
man
myself
slightly
wounded
one
of
our
horses
was
killed
and
buckskin
joe
was
wounded
but
i
did
discover
the
fact
until
some
time
afterwards
as
he
had
been
shot
in
the
breast
and
showed
no
signs
of
having
received
a
scratch
of
any
kind
securing
the
scalps
of
the
dead
indians
and
other
trophies
we
returned
to
the
fort
i
made
several
other
scouts
during
the
summer
with
different
officers
of
the
third
cavalry
one
being
with
major
alick
moore
a
good
officer
with
whom
i
was
out
for
thirty
days
another
long
one
was
with
major
curtis
with
whom
i
followed
some
indians
from
the
south
platte
river
to
fort
randall
on
the
missouri
river
in
dakota
on
which
trip
the
command
ran
out
of
rations
and
for
fifteen
days
subsisted
entirely
upon
the
game
we
killed
in
the
fall
of
the
earl
of
dunraven
and
kingsley
with
several
friends
came
to
fort
mcpherson
with
a
letter
from
general
sheridan
asking
me
to
accompany
them
on
an
elk
hunt
i
did
so
and
i
afterwards
spent
several
weeks
in
hunting
with
the
earl
of
dunraven
who
was
a
thorough
sportsman
and
an
excellent
hunter
it
was
while
i
was
out
with
the
earl
that
a
chicago
party
friends
of
general
sheridan
arrived
at
fort
mcpherson
for
the
purpose
of
going
out
on
a
hunt
they
too
had
a
letter
from
the
general
requesting
me
to
go
with
them
the
earl
had
not
yet
finished
his
hunt
but
as
i
had
been
out
with
him
for
several
weeks
and
he
had
by
this
time
learned
where
to
find
plenty
of
elks
and
other
game
i
concluded
to
leave
him
and
accompany
the
chicago
party
i
informed
him
of
my
intention
and
gave
him
my
reasons
for
going
at
the
same
time
telling
him
that
i
would
send
him
one
of
my
scouts
texas
jack
who
was
a
good
hunter
and
would
be
glad
to
accompany
him
the
earl
seemed
to
be
somewhat
offended
at
this
and
i
do
think
he
has
ever
forgiven
me
for
going
back
on
him
let
that
be
as
it
may
he
found
texas
jack
a
splendid
hunter
and
guide
and
jack
has
been
his
guide
on
several
hunts
since
illustration
texas
jack
among
the
gentlemen
who
composed
the
chicago
party
were
green
of
remington
the
rifle
manufacturer
alexander
sample
milligan
of
the
firm
of
heath
milligan
of
chicago
and
several
others
whose
names
i
do
not
now
remember
milligan
was
a
man
full
of
life
and
was
continually
boiling
over
with
fun
he
was
a
regular
velocipede
so
to
speak
and
was
here
there
and
everywhere
he
was
exceedingly
desirous
of
having
an
indian
fight
on
the
trip
not
that
he
was
naturally
a
man
but
just
for
variety
he
wanted
a
little
indian
pie
he
was
in
every
respect
the
life
of
the
party
during
the
entire
time
that
we
were
out
one
day
while
he
was
hunting
with
sample
and
myself
we
came
in
sight
of
a
band
of
thirty
mounted
indians
milligan
here
what
you
been
wanting
for
some
time
said
i
for
yonder
is
a
war
party
of
indians
and
no
mistake
and
they
come
for
us
you
bet
i
do
believe
this
is
one
of
my
fighting
days
replied
milligan
and
it
occurs
to
me
that
i
have
urgent
business
at
the
camp
our
camp
was
five
or
six
miles
distant
on
the
dismal
river
and
our
escort
consisted
of
a
company
of
cavalry
commanded
by
captain
russell
the
soldiers
were
in
camp
and
milligan
thought
that
captain
russell
ought
to
be
at
once
notified
of
the
appearance
of
these
indians
knowing
that
we
could
reach
the
camp
in
safety
for
we
were
well
mounted
i
continued
to
have
considerable
amusement
at
milligan
expense
who
finally
said
cody
what
making
my
hat
raise
up
so
i
can
hardly
keep
it
on
my
head
sample
who
was
as
cool
as
a
cucumber
said
to
milligan
there
must
be
something
wrong
with
your
hair
it
must
be
trying
to
get
on
end
it
all
very
fine
for
you
fellows
to
stand
here
and
talk
replied
milligan
but
i
am
not
doing
justice
to
my
family
by
remaining
sample
i
think
we
are
a
couple
of
old
fools
to
have
come
out
here
and
i
never
would
have
done
so
if
it
had
not
been
for
you
by
this
time
the
indians
had
discovered
us
and
were
holding
a
consultation
and
milligan
turned
his
horse
in
the
direction
of
the
camp
i
never
believed
that
he
was
half
as
scared
as
he
seemed
to
be
but
that
he
was
merely
pretending
so
that
we
could
enjoy
our
joke
however
we
did
not
wait
any
longer
but
rode
into
camp
and
notified
captain
russell
who
immediately
started
with
his
company
to
pursue
the
band
while
we
were
riding
along
with
the
company
milligan
said
to
sample
now
alick
let
them
come
on
we
may
yet
go
back
to
chicago
covered
with
glory
we
struck
the
trail
going
north
but
as
we
had
not
come
out
on
a
scout
for
indians
we
concluded
not
to
follow
them
although
milligan
was
now
very
anxious
to
proceed
and
clean
them
out
the
hunt
came
to
an
end
in
a
day
or
two
and
we
escorted
the
visiting
hunters
to
north
platte
where
they
took
the
train
for
chicago
before
their
departure
they
extended
to
me
a
very
cordial
invitation
to
come
to
their
city
on
a
visit
promising
that
i
should
be
well
taken
care
of
soon
after
this
i
had
the
pleasure
of
guiding
a
party
of
gentlemen
from
omaha
on
a
buffalo
hunt
among
the
number
were
judge
dundy
colonel
watson
smith
and
district
attorney
neville
we
left
fort
mcpherson
in
good
trim
i
was
greatly
amused
at
the
style
of
neville
who
wore
a
hat
and
a
coat
which
made
up
a
very
comical
rig
for
a
buffalo
hunter
as
we
galloped
over
the
prairie
he
jammed
his
hat
down
over
his
ears
to
keep
it
from
being
shaken
off
his
head
and
in
order
to
stick
to
his
horse
he
clung
to
the
pommel
of
his
saddle
he
was
not
much
of
a
rider
and
he
went
bouncing
up
and
down
with
his
flopping
in
the
air
the
sight
i
shall
never
forget
for
it
was
enough
to
make
a
horse
laugh
and
i
actually
believe
old
buckskin
joe
did
laugh
however
we
had
a
splendid
hunt
and
on
the
second
day
i
lariated
or
roped
a
big
buffalo
bull
and
tied
him
to
a
tree
a
feat
which
i
had
often
performed
and
which
the
gentlemen
requested
me
to
do
on
this
occasion
for
their
benefit
as
they
had
heard
of
my
skill
with
the
lariat
i
captured
several
other
buffaloes
in
the
same
way
the
gentlemen
returned
to
omaha
well
pleased
with
their
hunt
in
the
fall
of
the
year
a
convention
was
held
at
grand
island
when
some
of
my
friends
made
me
their
candidate
to
represent
the
district
in
the
legislature
of
nebraska
but
as
i
had
always
been
a
democrat
and
the
state
was
largely
republican
i
had
no
idea
of
being
elected
in
fact
i
cared
very
little
about
it
and
therefore
made
no
effort
whatever
to
secure
an
election
however
i
was
elected
and
that
is
the
way
in
which
i
acquired
my
title
of
honorable
chapter
xxviii
an
actor
during
the
summer
and
fall
of
i
received
numerous
letters
from
ned
buntline
urging
me
to
come
east
and
go
upon
the
stage
to
represent
my
own
character
there
money
in
it
he
wrote
and
you
will
prove
a
big
card
as
your
character
is
a
novelty
on
the
stage
at
times
i
almost
determined
to
make
the
venture
but
the
recollection
of
that
night
when
i
stood
on
the
stage
of
the
bowery
theatre
and
was
unable
to
utter
a
word
above
a
whisper
would
cause
me
to
stop
and
think
and
become
irresolute
i
feared
that
i
would
be
a
total
failure
and
wrote
buntline
to
that
effect
but
he
insisted
that
i
would
soon
get
over
all
that
embarrassment
and
become
accustomed
to
the
stage
so
that
i
would
think
no
more
of
appearing
before
five
thousand
people
than
i
would
before
half
a
dozen
he
proposed
to
organize
a
good
company
and
wished
me
to
meet
him
in
chicago
where
the
opening
performance
would
be
given
i
remained
undecided
as
to
what
i
ought
to
do
the
officers
at
the
fort
as
well
as
my
family
and
friends
to
whom
i
had
mentioned
the
matter
laughed
at
the
idea
of
my
ever
becoming
an
actor
that
i
an
old
scout
who
had
never
seen
more
than
twenty
or
thirty
theatrical
performances
in
my
life
should
think
of
going
upon
the
stage
was
ridiculous
in
the
extreme
so
they
all
said
a
few
days
after
my
election
to
the
legislature
a
happy
event
occurred
in
my
family
circle
in
the
birth
of
a
daughter
whom
we
named
ora
about
the
same
time
i
received
another
letter
from
buntline
in
which
he
requested
me
to
appear
on
the
stage
for
a
few
months
as
an
experiment
and
he
said
that
if
i
made
a
failure
or
did
not
like
the
business
i
could
easily
return
to
my
old
life
my
two
sisters
who
had
been
living
with
us
had
married
nellie
to
jester
a
cattle
man
and
may
to
ed
bradford
a
railroad
engineer
and
consequently
left
us
and
my
wife
had
been
wishing
for
a
long
time
to
visit
her
parents
in
louis
taking
these
and
other
things
into
consideration
i
finally
resolved
to
resign
my
seat
in
the
legislature
and
try
my
luck
behind
the
footlights
i
informed
general
reynolds
of
my
determination
telling
him
at
the
same
time
that
at
the
end
of
the
month
november
i
would
resign
my
position
under
him
the
general
regretted
to
hear
this
and
advised
me
not
to
take
the
step
for
i
was
leaving
a
comfortable
little
home
where
i
was
sure
of
making
a
good
living
for
my
family
while
on
the
other
hand
i
was
embarking
upon
a
sea
of
uncertainty
having
once
made
up
my
mind
however
nothing
could
change
it
while
i
was
selling
my
horses
and
other
effects
preparatory
to
leaving
the
fort
one
of
my
brother
scouts
texas
jack
said
that
he
would
like
to
accompany
me
now
as
jack
had
also
appeared
as
the
hero
in
one
of
ned
buntline
stories
i
thought
that
he
would
make
as
good
a
star
as
myself
and
it
was
accordingly
arranged
that
jack
should
go
with
me
on
our
way
east
we
stopped
in
omaha
a
day
or
two
to
visit
general
augur
and
other
officers
and
also
the
gentlemen
who
were
out
on
the
judge
dundy
hunt
judge
dundy
and
his
friends
gave
a
dinner
party
in
my
honor
at
the
leading
restaurant
and
entertained
me
very
handsomely
during
my
stay
in
the
city
at
omaha
i
parted
with
my
family
who
went
to
louis
while
jack
and
myself
proceeded
to
chicago
ned
buntline
and
milligan
having
been
apprised
of
our
coming
by
a
telegram
met
us
at
the
dépôt
milligan
accompanied
us
to
the
sherman
house
where
he
had
made
arrangements
for
us
to
be
his
guests
while
we
remained
in
the
city
i
did
see
much
of
buntline
that
evening
as
he
hurried
off
to
deliver
a
temperance
lecture
in
one
of
the
public
halls
the
next
day
we
met
him
by
appointment
and
the
first
thing
he
said
was
boys
are
you
ready
for
business
i
ca
answer
that
replied
i
for
we
do
know
what
we
are
going
to
do
it
all
arranged
said
he
and
you
have
no
trouble
whatever
come
with
me
we
go
and
see
nixon
manager
of
the
amphitheatre
that
the
place
where
we
are
to
play
we
open
there
next
monday
night
jack
and
myself
accordingly
accompanied
him
to
manager
nixon
office
without
saying
a
word
as
we
did
know
what
to
say
here
we
are
nixon
said
buntline
here
are
the
stars
for
you
here
are
the
boys
and
they
are
a
fine
pair
to
draw
too
now
nixon
i
am
prepared
for
business
nixon
and
buntline
had
evidently
had
a
talk
about
the
terms
of
our
engagement
buntline
it
seems
was
to
furnish
the
company
the
drama
and
the
pictorial
printing
and
was
to
receive
sixty
per
cent
of
the
gross
receipts
for
his
share
while
nixon
was
to
furnish
the
theater
the
the
orchestra
and
the
local
printing
and
receive
forty
per
cent
of
the
gross
receipts
i
am
ready
for
you
buntline
have
you
got
your
company
yet
asked
nixon
no
sir
but
there
are
plenty
of
idle
theatrical
people
in
town
and
i
can
raise
a
company
in
two
hours
was
his
reply
you
have
much
time
to
spare
if
you
open
on
monday
night
said
nixon
if
you
will
allow
me
to
look
at
your
drama
to
see
what
kind
of
people
you
want
i
assist
you
in
organizing
your
company
i
have
not
yet
written
the
drama
said
buntline
what
the
deuce
do
you
mean
this
is
wednesday
and
you
propose
to
open
on
next
monday
night
the
idea
is
ridiculous
here
you
are
at
this
late
hour
without
a
company
and
without
a
drama
this
will
never
do
buntline
i
shall
have
to
break
my
contract
with
you
for
you
ca
possibly
write
a
drama
cast
it
and
rehearse
it
properly
for
monday
night
furthermore
you
have
no
pictorial
printing
as
yet
these
two
gentlemen
whom
you
have
with
you
have
never
been
on
the
stage
and
they
certainly
must
have
time
to
study
their
parts
it
is
preposterous
to
think
of
opening
on
monday
night
and
i
cancel
the
engagement
this
little
speech
was
delivered
in
rather
an
excited
manner
by
nixon
buntline
said
that
he
would
write
the
drama
that
day
and
also
select
his
company
and
have
them
at
the
theater
for
rehearsal
next
morning
nixon
laughed
at
him
and
said
that
there
was
no
use
of
trying
to
undertake
anything
of
the
kind
in
so
short
a
time
it
was
utterly
impossible
to
do
it
buntline
whose
ire
was
rising
said
to
nixon
what
rent
will
you
ask
for
your
theater
for
next
week
six
hundred
dollars
was
the
reply
well
sir
i
take
your
theater
for
next
week
at
that
price
and
here
is
half
of
the
amount
in
advance
said
buntline
as
he
threw
down
three
hundred
dollars
on
the
stand
nixon
took
the
money
gave
a
receipt
for
it
and
had
nothing
more
to
say
now
come
with
me
boys
said
buntline
and
away
we
went
to
the
hotel
buntline
immediately
obtained
a
supply
of
pens
ink
and
paper
and
then
engaged
all
the
hotel
clerks
as
penmen
in
less
than
an
hour
after
he
had
rented
the
theater
he
was
dashing
off
page
after
page
of
his
proposed
drama
the
work
being
done
in
his
room
at
the
hotel
he
then
set
his
clerks
at
copying
for
him
and
at
the
end
of
four
hours
he
jumped
up
from
the
table
and
enthusiastically
shouted
hurrah
for
scouts
of
the
plains
that
the
name
of
the
play
the
work
is
done
hurrah
the
parts
were
then
all
copied
off
separately
by
the
clerks
and
handing
us
our
respective
portions
buntline
said
now
boys
go
to
work
and
do
your
level
best
to
have
this
perfect
for
the
rehearsal
which
takes
place
morning
at
ten
prompt
i
want
to
show
nixon
that
we
be
ready
on
time
illustration
studying
the
parts
i
looked
at
my
part
and
then
at
jack
and
jack
looked
at
his
part
and
then
at
me
then
we
looked
at
each
other
and
then
at
buntline
we
did
not
know
what
to
make
of
the
man
how
long
will
it
take
you
to
commit
your
part
to
memory
bill
asked
jack
about
six
months
as
near
as
i
can
calculate
how
long
will
it
take
you
answered
i
it
will
take
me
about
that
length
of
time
to
learn
the
first
line
said
jack
nevertheless
we
went
to
our
room
and
commenced
studying
i
thought
it
was
the
hardest
work
i
had
ever
done
this
is
dry
business
finally
remarked
jack
that
just
what
it
is
i
answered
jerk
the
bell
jack
the
soon
appeared
we
ordered
refreshments
after
partaking
thereof
we
resumed
our
task
we
studied
hard
for
an
hour
or
two
but
finally
gave
it
up
as
a
bad
job
although
we
had
succeeded
in
committing
a
small
portion
to
memory
buntline
now
came
into
the
room
and
said
boys
how
are
you
getting
along
i
guess
we
have
to
go
back
on
this
studying
business
as
it
is
our
said
i
do
weaken
now
bill
you
come
out
on
the
top
of
the
heap
yet
let
me
hear
you
recite
your
part
said
buntline
i
began
spouting
what
i
had
learned
but
was
interrupted
by
buntline
tut
tut
you
not
saying
it
right
you
must
stop
at
the
cue
cue
what
the
mischief
do
you
mean
by
the
cue
i
never
saw
any
cue
except
in
a
billiard
room
said
buntline
thereupon
explained
it
to
me
as
well
as
to
jack
who
was
ignorant
as
myself
concerning
the
cue
business
jack
i
think
we
had
better
back
out
and
go
to
hunting
again
said
i
see
here
boys
it
wo
do
to
go
back
on
me
at
this
stage
of
the
game
stick
to
it
and
it
may
be
the
turning
point
in
your
lives
and
lead
you
on
to
fortune
and
to
fame
a
fortune
is
what
we
are
after
and
we
at
least
give
the
wheel
a
turn
or
two
and
see
what
luck
we
have
said
i
this
satisfied
buntline
but
we
did
study
any
more
after
he
left
us
the
next
morning
we
appeared
at
rehearsal
and
were
introduced
to
the
company
the
first
rehearsal
was
hardly
a
success
and
the
succeeding
ones
were
not
much
better
the
stage
manager
did
his
best
to
teach
jack
and
myself
what
to
do
but
when
monday
night
came
we
did
know
much
more
about
it
than
when
we
began
the
clock
struck
seven
and
then
we
put
on
our
buckskin
suits
which
were
the
costumes
we
were
to
appear
in
the
theater
was
being
rapidly
filled
and
it
was
evident
that
we
were
going
to
make
our
before
a
packed
house
as
the
minutes
passed
by
jack
and
i
became
more
and
more
nervous
we
occasionally
looked
through
the
holes
in
the
curtain
and
saw
that
the
people
were
continuing
to
crowd
into
the
theatre
our
nervousness
increased
to
an
uncomfortable
degree
when
at
length
the
curtain
arose
our
courage
had
returned
so
that
we
thought
we
could
face
the
immense
crowd
yet
when
the
time
came
for
us
to
go
on
we
were
rather
slow
in
making
our
appearance
as
we
stepped
forth
we
were
received
with
a
storm
of
applause
which
we
acknowledged
with
a
bow
illustration
behind
the
footlights
buntline
who
was
taking
the
part
of
cale
durg
appeared
and
gave
me
the
cue
to
speak
my
little
piece
but
for
the
life
of
me
i
could
not
remember
a
single
word
buntline
saw
i
was
stuck
and
a
happy
thought
occurred
to
him
he
said
as
if
it
were
in
the
play
where
have
you
been
bill
what
has
kept
you
so
long
just
then
my
eye
happened
to
fall
on
milligan
who
was
surrounded
by
his
friends
the
newspaper
reporters
and
several
military
officers
all
of
whom
had
heard
of
his
hunt
and
indian
fight
he
being
a
very
popular
man
and
widely
known
in
chicago
so
i
said
i
have
been
out
on
a
hunt
with
milligan
this
proved
to
be
a
big
hit
the
audience
cheered
and
applauded
which
gave
me
greater
confidence
in
my
ability
to
get
through
the
performance
all
right
buntline
who
is
a
very
versatile
man
saw
that
it
would
be
a
good
plan
to
follow
this
up
and
he
said
well
bill
tell
us
all
about
the
hunt
i
thereupon
proceeded
to
relate
in
detail
the
particulars
of
the
affair
i
succeeded
in
making
it
rather
funny
and
i
was
frequently
interrupted
by
rounds
of
applause
whenever
i
began
to
weaken
buntline
would
give
me
a
fresh
start
by
asking
some
question
in
this
way
i
took
up
fifteen
minutes
without
once
speaking
a
word
of
my
part
nor
did
i
speak
a
word
of
it
during
the
whole
evening
the
prompter
who
was
standing
between
the
wings
attempted
to
prompt
me
but
it
did
no
good
for
while
i
was
on
the
stage
i
chipped
in
anything
i
thought
of
the
scouts
of
the
plains
was
an
indian
drama
of
course
and
there
were
between
forty
and
fifty
supers
dressed
as
indians
in
the
fight
with
them
jack
and
i
were
at
home
we
blazed
away
at
each
other
with
blank
cartridges
and
when
the
scene
ended
in
a
encounter
a
general
and
the
way
jack
and
i
killed
indians
was
a
caution
we
would
kill
them
all
off
in
one
act
but
they
would
come
up
again
ready
for
business
in
the
next
finally
the
curtain
dropped
the
play
was
ended
and
i
congratulated
jack
and
myself
on
having
made
such
a
brilliant
there
was
no
backing
out
after
that
the
next
morning
there
appeared
in
the
chicago
papers
some
very
funny
criticisms
on
our
first
performance
the
papers
gave
us
a
better
than
i
expected
for
they
did
not
criticise
us
as
actors
the
said
that
if
buntline
had
actually
spent
four
hours
in
writing
that
play
it
was
difficult
for
any
one
to
see
what
he
had
been
doing
all
the
time
buntline
as
cale
durg
was
killed
in
the
second
act
after
a
long
temperance
speech
and
the
said
that
it
was
to
be
regretted
that
he
had
not
been
killed
in
the
first
act
the
company
however
was
very
good
and
mdlle
morlacchi
as
pale
dove
particularly
fine
while
miss
cafarno
spouted
a
poem
of
some
seven
hundred
and
three
verses
more
or
less
of
which
the
reader
will
be
glad
to
know
that
i
only
recall
the
words
i
was
born
in
march
our
engagement
proved
a
decided
success
financially
if
not
artistically
nixon
was
greatly
surprised
at
the
result
and
at
the
end
of
the
week
he
induced
buntline
to
take
him
in
as
a
partner
in
the
company
the
next
week
we
played
at
debar
opera
house
in
louis
doing
an
immense
business
the
following
week
we
were
at
cincinnati
where
the
theater
was
so
crowded
every
night
that
hundreds
were
unable
to
obtain
admission
we
met
with
equal
success
all
over
the
country
theatrical
managers
upon
hearing
of
this
new
and
novel
combination
which
was
drawing
such
tremendous
houses
were
all
anxious
to
secure
us
and
we
received
offers
of
engagements
at
all
the
leading
theaters
we
played
one
week
at
the
boston
theater
and
the
gross
receipts
amounted
to
we
also
appeared
at
niblo
garden
new
york
the
theater
being
crowded
to
its
utmost
capacity
every
night
of
the
engagement
at
the
arch
street
theater
philadelphia
it
was
the
same
way
there
was
not
a
single
city
where
we
did
not
have
crowded
houses
we
closed
our
tour
on
the
of
june
at
port
jervis
new
york
and
when
i
counted
up
my
share
of
the
profits
i
found
that
i
was
only
about
ahead
i
was
somewhat
disappointed
for
judging
from
our
large
business
i
certainly
had
expected
a
greater
sum
texas
jack
and
myself
longed
for
a
hunt
on
the
western
prairies
once
more
and
on
meeting
in
new
york
a
party
of
gentlemen
who
were
desirous
of
going
with
us
we
all
started
westward
and
after
a
pleasant
trip
arrived
at
fort
mcpherson
chapter
xxix
starring
texas
jack
and
i
spent
several
weeks
in
hunting
in
the
western
part
of
nebraska
and
at
the
end
of
our
vacation
we
felt
greatly
and
ready
for
another
theatrical
campaign
we
accordingly
proceeded
to
new
york
and
organized
a
company
for
the
season
of
thinking
that
wild
bill
would
be
quite
an
acquisition
to
the
troupe
we
wrote
to
him
at
springfield
missouri
offering
him
a
large
salary
if
he
would
play
with
us
that
winter
he
was
doing
nothing
at
the
time
and
we
thought
that
he
would
like
to
take
a
trip
through
the
states
as
he
had
never
been
east
wild
bill
accepted
our
offer
and
came
on
to
new
york
though
he
told
us
from
the
start
that
we
could
never
make
an
actor
out
of
him
although
he
had
a
fine
stage
appearance
and
was
a
handsome
fellow
and
possessed
a
good
strong
voice
yet
when
he
went
upon
the
stage
before
an
audience
it
was
almost
impossible
for
him
to
utter
a
word
he
insisted
that
we
were
making
a
set
of
fools
of
ourselves
and
that
we
were
the
of
the
people
i
replied
that
i
did
not
care
for
that
as
long
as
they
came
and
bought
tickets
to
see
us
wild
bill
was
continually
playing
tricks
upon
the
members
of
the
company
and
it
was
his
especial
delight
to
torment
the
supers
quite
frequently
in
our
sham
indian
battles
he
would
run
up
to
the
indians
the
supers
and
putting
his
pistol
close
to
their
legs
would
fire
at
them
and
burn
them
with
the
powder
instead
of
shooting
over
their
heads
this
would
make
them
dance
and
jump
so
that
it
was
difficult
to
make
them
fall
and
die
although
they
were
paid
cents
each
for
performing
the
dying
business
the
poor
supers
often
complained
to
me
about
this
and
threatened
not
to
go
on
the
stage
and
be
killed
again
if
that
man
wild
bill
did
not
stop
shooting
and
burning
their
legs
i
would
order
wild
bill
to
stop
his
mischief
he
would
laugh
and
then
promise
not
to
do
it
any
more
but
it
would
not
be
long
before
he
was
at
his
old
tricks
again
my
company
known
as
the
buffalo
bill
combination
did
a
fine
business
all
through
the
east
wild
bill
continued
his
pranks
which
caused
us
considerable
annoyance
but
at
the
same
time
greatly
amused
us
one
day
at
titusville
pennsylvania
while
burke
the
business
agent
was
registering
our
names
and
making
arrangements
for
our
accommodation
several
of
us
started
for
the
billiard
room
but
were
met
by
the
landlord
who
stopped
me
and
said
that
there
was
a
party
of
roughs
from
the
lower
oil
region
who
were
spreeing
and
had
boasted
that
they
were
staying
in
town
to
meet
the
buffalo
bill
gang
and
clean
them
out
the
landlord
begged
of
me
not
to
allow
the
members
of
the
troupe
to
enter
the
billiard
room
as
he
did
not
wish
any
fight
in
his
house
to
please
the
landlord
and
at
his
suggestion
i
called
the
boys
up
into
the
parlor
and
explained
to
them
the
situation
wild
bill
wanted
to
go
at
once
and
fight
the
whole
mob
but
i
persuaded
him
to
keep
away
from
them
during
the
day
in
order
to
entirely
avoid
the
roughs
the
members
of
the
company
entered
the
theater
through
a
private
door
from
the
hotel
as
the
two
buildings
joined
each
other
while
i
was
standing
at
the
door
of
the
theater
taking
the
tickets
the
landlord
of
the
hotel
came
rushing
up
and
said
that
wild
bill
was
having
a
fight
with
the
roughs
in
the
it
seemed
that
bill
had
not
been
able
to
resist
the
temptation
of
going
to
see
what
kind
of
a
mob
it
was
that
wanted
to
test
the
pluck
of
the
buffalo
bill
party
and
just
as
he
stepped
into
the
room
one
of
the
bruisers
put
his
hand
on
his
shoulder
and
said
hello
buffalo
bill
we
have
been
looking
for
you
all
day
my
name
is
not
buffalo
bill
you
are
mistaken
in
the
man
was
the
reply
you
are
a
liar
said
the
bruiser
bill
instantly
knocked
him
down
and
then
seizing
a
chair
he
laid
out
four
or
five
of
the
crowd
on
the
floor
and
drove
the
rest
out
of
the
room
all
this
was
done
in
a
minute
or
two
and
by
the
time
i
got
down
stairs
bill
was
coming
out
of
the
whistling
a
lively
tune
well
said
he
i
have
been
interviewing
that
party
who
wanted
to
clean
us
out
i
thought
you
promised
to
come
into
the
opera
house
by
the
private
entrance
i
did
try
to
follow
that
trail
but
i
got
lost
among
the
cañons
and
then
i
ran
in
among
the
hostiles
said
he
but
it
is
all
right
now
they
wo
bother
us
any
more
i
guess
those
fellows
have
found
us
and
sure
enough
they
had
we
heard
no
more
of
them
after
that
another
incident
occurred
one
night
at
portland
maine
bill
found
it
impossible
to
go
to
sleep
at
the
hotel
on
account
of
the
continued
talking
of
some
parties
who
were
engaged
in
a
game
of
cards
in
an
adjoining
room
he
called
to
them
several
times
to
make
less
noise
but
they
paid
little
or
no
attention
to
him
he
finally
got
up
and
went
to
the
room
with
the
intention
of
cleaning
out
the
whole
crowd
he
knocked
and
was
admitted
greatly
to
his
surprise
he
found
the
party
to
be
some
merchants
of
the
city
whom
he
had
met
the
previous
day
they
were
playing
poker
and
invited
him
to
take
a
hand
bill
sat
down
at
the
table
and
said
that
inasmuch
as
they
would
not
let
him
sleep
he
would
mind
playing
for
a
while
provided
they
would
post
him
a
little
in
the
game
for
he
did
know
much
about
it
at
first
he
did
play
very
well
intentionally
making
many
blunders
and
asking
numerous
questions
but
when
morning
came
he
was
about
seven
hundred
dollars
ahead
bill
put
the
money
in
his
pocket
and
just
as
he
was
leaving
the
room
he
advised
them
never
to
wake
a
man
up
and
invite
him
to
play
poker
illustration
learning
the
game
wild
bill
remained
with
me
until
we
reached
rochester
i
met
my
family
there
and
having
bought
some
property
in
that
city
with
the
intention
of
making
the
place
my
home
i
asked
bill
not
to
cut
up
any
of
his
capers
for
i
wanted
the
performance
to
go
off
smoothly
as
i
expected
a
large
audience
that
evening
he
of
course
promised
to
behave
himself
when
the
curtain
rose
the
house
was
crowded
the
play
proceeded
finely
until
the
indian
fight
in
the
second
act
when
bill
amused
himself
by
his
old
trick
of
singeing
the
legs
of
the
supers
after
the
curtain
dropped
the
supers
complained
to
me
about
it
bill
conduct
made
me
angry
and
i
told
him
that
he
must
either
stop
shooting
the
supers
or
leave
the
company
he
made
no
reply
but
went
to
the
and
changed
his
buckskin
suit
for
his
dress
and
during
one
of
my
scenes
i
looked
down
in
front
and
saw
him
elbowing
his
way
through
the
audience
and
out
of
the
theater
when
i
had
finished
the
scene
and
had
retired
from
the
stage
the
came
up
and
said
that
gentleman
who
passed
out
a
few
minutes
ago
requested
me
to
tell
you
that
you
could
go
to
thunder
with
your
old
show
that
was
the
last
time
that
wild
bill
and
i
ever
performed
together
on
the
stage
after
the
evening
entertainment
i
met
him
at
the
osborn
house
by
this
time
he
had
recovered
from
his
mad
fit
and
was
in
as
good
humor
as
ever
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
leave
for
the
west
the
next
day
i
endeavored
to
persuade
him
to
remain
with
me
till
spring
and
then
we
would
go
together
but
it
was
of
no
use
i
then
paid
him
the
money
due
him
and
jack
and
myself
made
him
a
present
of
besides
bill
went
to
new
york
the
next
day
intending
to
start
west
from
there
several
days
afterwards
i
learned
that
he
had
lost
all
his
money
in
new
york
by
playing
faro
also
that
a
theatrical
manager
had
engaged
him
to
play
a
company
was
organized
and
started
out
but
as
a
star
wild
bill
was
not
a
success
the
further
he
went
the
poorer
he
got
this
suit
bill
by
any
means
and
he
accordingly
retired
from
the
stage
the
company
however
kept
on
the
road
using
bill
name
and
employing
an
actor
to
represent
him
not
only
on
the
stage
but
on
the
street
and
elsewhere
bill
heard
of
this
deception
and
sent
word
to
the
manager
to
stop
it
but
no
attention
was
paid
to
his
message
finally
bill
resolved
to
have
satisfaction
and
he
proceeded
to
a
town
where
the
company
was
to
play
he
entered
the
theater
and
took
a
seat
near
the
stage
and
watched
the
performance
until
the
bogus
wild
bill
appeared
he
then
sprang
upon
the
stage
knocked
the
actor
clear
through
one
of
the
scenes
and
grabbing
the
manager
by
the
shoulders
he
threw
him
over
the
into
the
orchestra
illustration
getting
satisfaction
the
other
actors
screamed
and
yelled
police
the
audience
could
not
at
first
understand
what
it
all
meant
some
of
them
supposing
the
affair
to
be
a
part
of
the
play
wild
bill
retired
from
the
stage
in
good
order
resumed
his
seat
and
told
them
to
go
on
with
their
show
a
policeman
now
appearing
bill
was
pointed
out
as
the
disturber
of
the
peace
the
officer
tapping
him
on
the
shoulder
said
i
have
to
arrest
you
sir
how
many
of
you
are
there
asked
bill
only
myself
said
the
policeman
you
had
better
get
some
help
said
bill
the
officer
then
called
up
another
policeman
and
bill
again
asked
how
many
of
you
are
there
now
two
was
the
reply
then
i
advise
you
to
go
out
and
get
some
more
reinforcements
said
bill
very
coolly
the
policemen
thereupon
spoke
to
the
sheriff
who
was
dressed
in
citizen
clothes
the
sheriff
came
up
and
said
he
would
have
to
take
him
into
custody
all
right
sir
replied
bill
i
have
no
objections
to
walking
out
with
you
but
i
wo
go
with
any
two
policemen
at
the
court
next
morning
bill
stated
his
reasons
for
having
acted
as
he
had
done
and
the
judge
fined
him
only
three
dollars
and
costs
this
was
the
last
time
that
wild
bill
appeared
on
the
stage
he
shortly
afterwards
returned
to
the
west
and
on
arriving
at
cheyenne
he
visited
boulder
gambling
room
and
sat
down
at
a
faro
table
no
one
in
the
room
recognized
him
as
he
had
not
been
in
cheyenne
for
several
years
after
losing
two
or
three
bets
he
threw
down
a
fifty
dollar
bill
and
lost
that
also
boulder
quietly
raked
in
the
money
bill
placed
a
second
fifty
dollar
note
on
another
card
when
boulder
informed
him
that
the
limit
was
dollars
you
have
just
taken
in
a
fifty
dollar
bill
which
i
lost
said
bill
well
you
need
make
any
more
such
bets
as
i
will
not
go
above
my
limit
replied
boulder
i
just
play
that
fifty
dollar
bill
as
it
lays
if
it
loses
yours
if
it
wins
you
pay
me
fifty
dollars
or
i
know
the
reason
why
i
am
running
this
game
and
i
want
no
talk
from
you
sir
said
boulder
one
word
brought
on
another
until
boulder
threatened
to
have
bill
put
out
of
the
house
bill
was
carrying
the
butt
end
of
a
billiard
cue
for
a
cane
and
bending
over
the
table
he
said
you
rob
a
blind
man
then
he
suddenly
tapped
boulder
on
the
head
with
the
cane
with
such
force
as
to
knock
him
over
with
another
sweep
of
the
cane
he
tumbled
the
from
his
chair
and
then
reaching
over
into
the
money
drawer
he
grabbed
a
handful
of
greenbacks
and
stuck
them
in
his
pocket
at
this
stage
of
the
game
four
or
five
men
who
were
employed
as
bouncers
for
the
establishment
to
throw
out
the
noisy
persons
rushed
up
to
capture
bill
but
he
knocked
them
right
and
left
with
his
cane
and
seeing
the
whole
crowd
was
now
closing
in
on
him
he
jumped
into
a
corner
and
with
each
hand
drew
a
revolver
and
faced
the
enemy
at
this
moment
the
recognized
him
and
sang
out
in
a
loud
voice
look
out
boys
that
wild
bill
you
run
against
that
settled
the
matter
for
when
they
heard
the
name
of
wild
bill
they
turned
and
beat
a
hasty
retreat
out
of
the
doors
and
windows
and
in
less
time
than
it
takes
to
tell
it
wild
bill
was
the
only
man
in
the
room
he
coolly
walked
over
to
dyer
hotel
and
retired
for
the
night
boulder
claimed
that
he
had
taken
but
he
really
got
only
boulder
upon
learning
that
it
was
wild
bill
who
had
cleaned
him
out
said
nothing
more
about
the
money
the
next
day
the
two
men
met
over
a
bottle
of
wine
and
settled
their
differences
in
an
amicable
manner
poor
bill
was
afterwards
killed
at
deadwood
in
the
black
hills
in
a
cowardly
manner
by
a
desperado
who
sneaked
up
behind
him
while
he
was
playing
a
game
of
cards
in
a
saloon
and
shot
him
through
the
back
of
the
head
without
the
least
provocation
the
murderer
jack
mccall
was
tried
and
hung
at
yankton
dakotah
for
the
crime
thus
ended
the
career
of
a
friend
of
mine
who
in
spite
of
his
many
faults
was
a
noble
man
ever
brave
and
generous
hearted
jack
and
myself
continued
playing
through
the
country
after
wild
bill
left
us
and
we
finally
closed
our
season
in
boston
on
the
of
may
business
called
me
from
boston
to
new
york
and
after
i
had
been
there
a
few
days
i
met
an
english
gentleman
thomas
medley
of
london
who
had
come
to
america
for
a
hunt
on
the
plains
he
had
often
heard
of
me
and
was
anxious
to
engage
me
as
his
guide
and
companion
and
he
offered
to
pay
the
liberal
salary
of
one
thousand
dollars
a
month
while
i
was
with
him
he
was
a
very
wealthy
man
as
i
learned
upon
inquiry
and
was
a
relative
of
lord
of
the
firm
of
lord
taylor
of
new
york
of
course
i
accepted
his
offer
when
we
reached
the
hunting
ground
in
nebraska
he
informed
me
somewhat
to
my
surprise
that
he
did
not
want
to
go
out
as
alexis
did
with
carriages
servants
and
other
luxuries
but
that
he
wished
to
rough
it
just
as
i
would
do
to
sleep
on
the
ground
in
the
open
air
and
kill
and
cook
his
own
meat
we
started
out
from
north
platte
and
spent
several
weeks
in
hunting
all
over
the
county
carver
who
then
resided
at
north
platte
and
who
has
recently
acquired
considerable
notoriety
as
a
hunted
with
us
for
a
few
days
medley
proved
to
be
a
very
agreeable
gentleman
and
an
excellent
hunter
while
in
camp
he
busied
himself
in
carrying
wood
and
water
attending
to
the
fire
and
preparing
and
cooking
the
meals
never
asking
me
to
do
a
thing
he
did
not
do
this
to
save
expenses
but
because
he
wanted
to
do
as
the
other
hunters
in
the
party
were
doing
after
spending
as
much
time
as
he
wished
we
returned
to
the
railroad
and
he
took
the
train
for
the
east
everything
that
was
required
on
this
hunt
was
paid
for
in
the
most
liberal
manner
by
medley
who
also
gave
the
members
of
the
party
several
handsome
presents
about
this
time
an
expedition
consisting
of
seven
companies
of
cavalry
and
two
companies
of
infantry
to
be
commanded
by
colonel
mills
of
the
third
cavalry
was
being
organized
to
scout
the
powder
river
and
big
horn
country
and
i
was
employed
as
guide
for
the
command
proceeding
to
rawlins
wyoming
we
outfitted
and
other
guides
were
engaged
among
them
tom
sun
and
bony
ernest
two
noted
rocky
mountain
scouts
we
there
left
the
railroad
and
passing
through
the
seminole
range
of
the
rocky
mountains
we
established
our
supply
camp
at
the
foot
of
independence
rock
on
the
sweetwater
i
was
now
on
my
old
familiar
stamping
ground
and
it
seemed
like
home
to
me
fifteen
years
before
i
had
ridden
the
pony
express
and
driven
the
overland
stages
through
this
region
and
the
command
was
going
into
the
same
section
of
country
where
wild
expedition
of
and
had
recaptured
from
the
indians
a
large
number
of
stolen
leaving
the
infantry
to
guard
the
supply
camp
colonel
mills
struck
out
for
the
north
with
the
seven
companies
of
cavalry
one
day
while
we
were
resting
on
a
prairie
near
the
head
of
powder
river
a
horseman
was
seen
in
the
distance
approaching
us
at
first
it
was
thought
he
was
an
indian
but
as
he
came
near
we
saw
that
he
was
a
white
man
and
finally
when
he
rode
up
to
us
i
recognized
him
as
california
joe
a
noted
scout
and
frontiersman
who
had
spent
many
years
in
california
on
the
plains
and
in
the
mountains
he
was
armed
with
a
heavy
old
sharpe
rifle
a
revolver
and
a
knife
i
introduced
him
to
colonel
mills
and
the
other
officers
and
asked
him
where
he
was
going
he
replied
that
he
was
out
for
a
morning
ride
only
but
the
fact
was
that
he
had
been
out
prospecting
alone
for
weeks
along
the
foot
of
the
big
horn
mountains
having
no
permanent
occupation
just
at
that
time
joe
accompanied
us
for
two
or
three
days
when
colonel
mills
suggested
that
i
had
better
employ
him
as
a
scout
so
that
he
could
make
a
little
money
for
himself
joe
did
seem
to
care
whether
i
hired
him
or
not
but
i
put
him
on
the
and
while
he
was
with
us
he
drew
his
five
dollars
a
day
it
was
worth
the
money
to
have
him
along
for
company
sake
for
he
was
a
droll
character
in
his
way
and
afforded
us
considerable
amusement
we
finally
surprised
little
wolf
band
of
arapahoes
and
drove
them
into
the
agencies
we
then
scouted
the
powder
river
crazy
woman
fork
and
clear
fork
and
then
pushed
westward
through
the
mountains
to
the
wind
river
after
having
been
out
for
a
month
or
two
we
were
ordered
to
return
i
immediately
went
east
and
organized
another
dramatic
company
for
the
season
of
texas
jack
being
absent
in
the
yellowstone
country
hunting
with
the
earl
of
dunraven
i
played
my
company
in
all
the
principal
cities
of
the
country
doing
a
good
business
wherever
i
went
the
summer
of
i
spent
at
rochester
with
my
family
for
the
season
of
texas
jack
and
i
reorganized
our
old
combination
and
made
a
very
successful
tour
while
we
were
playing
at
springfield
massachusetts
april
and
a
telegram
was
handed
me
just
as
i
was
going
on
the
stage
i
opened
it
and
found
it
to
be
from
colonel
torrence
of
rochester
an
intimate
friend
of
the
family
who
stated
that
my
little
boy
kit
was
dangerously
ill
with
the
scarlet
fever
this
was
indeed
sad
news
for
little
kit
had
always
been
my
greatest
pride
i
sent
for
john
burke
our
business
manager
and
showing
him
the
telegram
told
him
that
i
would
play
the
first
act
and
making
a
proper
excuse
to
the
audience
i
would
then
take
the
nine
train
that
same
evening
for
rochester
leaving
him
to
play
out
my
part
this
i
did
and
at
ten
the
next
morning
i
arrived
in
rochester
and
was
met
at
the
dépôt
by
my
intimate
friend
moses
kerngood
who
at
once
drove
me
to
my
home
i
found
my
little
boy
unable
to
speak
but
he
seemed
to
recognize
me
and
putting
his
little
arms
around
my
neck
he
tried
to
kiss
me
we
did
everything
in
our
power
to
save
him
but
it
was
of
no
avail
the
lord
claimed
his
own
and
that
evening
at
six
my
beloved
little
kit
died
in
my
arms
we
laid
him
away
to
rest
in
the
beautiful
cemetery
of
mount
hope
amid
sorrow
and
tears
chapter
xxx
i
return
to
the
plains
we
closed
our
theatrical
season
earlier
than
usual
in
the
spring
of
because
i
was
anxious
to
take
part
in
the
sioux
war
which
was
then
breaking
out
colonel
hills
had
written
me
several
letters
saying
that
general
crook
was
anxious
to
have
me
accompany
his
command
and
i
promised
to
do
so
intending
to
overtake
him
in
the
powder
river
country
but
when
i
arrived
at
chicago
on
my
way
west
i
learned
that
my
old
regiment
the
gallant
fifth
cavalry
was
on
its
way
back
from
arizona
to
join
general
crook
and
that
my
old
commander
general
carr
was
in
command
he
had
written
to
military
headquarters
at
chicago
to
learn
my
whereabouts
as
he
wished
to
secure
me
as
his
guide
and
chief
of
scouts
i
then
gave
up
the
idea
of
overtaking
general
crook
and
hastening
on
to
cheyenne
where
the
fifth
cavalry
had
already
arrived
i
was
met
at
the
dépôt
by
lieutenant
king
adjutant
of
the
regiment
he
having
been
sent
down
from
fort
russell
for
that
purpose
by
general
carr
who
had
learned
by
a
telegram
from
military
headquarters
at
chicago
that
i
was
on
the
way
i
accompanied
the
lieutenant
on
horseback
to
the
camp
and
as
we
rode
up
one
of
the
boys
shouted
here
buffalo
bill
soon
after
there
came
three
hearty
cheers
from
the
regiment
officers
and
men
all
were
glad
to
see
me
and
i
was
equally
delighted
to
meet
them
once
more
the
general
at
once
appointed
me
his
guide
and
chief
of
scouts
the
next
morning
the
command
pulled
out
for
fort
laramie
and
on
reaching
that
post
we
found
general
sheridan
there
accompanied
by
general
frye
and
general
forsyth
to
red
cloud
agency
as
the
command
was
to
remain
here
a
few
days
i
accompanied
general
sheridan
to
red
cloud
and
back
taking
a
company
of
cavalry
as
escort
the
indians
having
recently
committed
a
great
many
depredations
on
the
black
hills
road
the
fifth
cavalry
was
sent
out
to
scout
the
country
between
the
indian
agencies
and
the
hills
the
command
operated
on
the
south
fork
of
the
cheyenne
and
at
the
foot
of
the
black
hills
for
about
two
weeks
having
several
small
engagements
with
roving
bands
of
indians
during
the
time
general
wesley
merritt
who
had
lately
received
his
promotion
to
the
colonelcy
of
the
fifth
cavalry
now
came
out
and
took
control
of
the
regiment
i
was
sorry
that
the
command
was
taken
from
general
carr
because
under
him
it
had
made
its
fighting
reputation
however
upon
becoming
acquainted
with
general
merritt
i
found
him
to
be
an
excellent
officer
the
regiment
by
continued
scouting
soon
drove
the
indians
out
of
that
section
of
the
country
as
we
supposed
and
we
had
started
on
our
way
back
to
fort
laramie
when
a
scout
arrived
at
the
camp
and
reported
the
massacre
of
general
custer
and
his
band
of
heroes
on
the
little
big
horn
on
the
of
june
and
he
also
brought
orders
to
general
merritt
to
proceed
at
once
to
fort
fetterman
and
join
general
crook
in
the
big
horn
country
colonel
stanton
who
was
with
the
fifth
cavalry
on
this
scout
had
been
sent
to
red
cloud
agency
two
days
before
and
that
same
evening
a
scout
arrived
bringing
a
message
from
him
that
eight
hundred
cheyenne
warriors
had
that
day
left
the
red
cloud
agency
to
join
sitting
bull
hostile
forces
in
the
big
horn
region
notwithstanding
the
instructions
to
proceed
immediately
to
join
general
crook
by
the
way
of
fort
fetterman
colonel
merritt
took
the
responsibility
of
endeavoring
to
intercept
the
cheyennes
and
as
the
sequel
shows
he
performed
a
very
important
service
he
selected
five
hundred
men
and
horses
and
in
two
hours
we
were
making
a
forced
march
back
to
hat
or
creek
the
intention
being
to
reach
the
main
indian
trail
running
to
the
north
across
that
creek
before
the
cheyennes
could
get
there
we
arrived
there
the
next
night
and
at
daylight
the
following
morning
july
i
went
out
on
a
scout
and
found
that
the
indians
had
not
yet
crossed
the
creek
on
my
way
back
to
the
command
i
discovered
a
large
party
of
indians
which
proved
to
be
the
cheyennes
coming
up
from
the
south
and
i
hurried
to
the
camp
with
this
important
information
the
cavalrymen
quietly
mounted
their
horses
and
were
ordered
to
remain
out
of
sight
while
general
merritt
accompanied
by
two
or
three
and
myself
went
out
on
a
little
tour
of
observation
to
a
neighboring
hill
from
the
summit
of
which
we
saw
that
the
indians
were
approaching
almost
directly
towards
us
presently
fifteen
or
twenty
of
them
dashed
off
to
the
west
in
the
direction
from
which
we
had
come
the
night
before
and
upon
closer
observation
with
our
field
glasses
we
discovered
two
mounted
soldiers
evidently
carrying
dispatches
for
us
pushing
forward
on
our
trail
the
indians
were
evidently
endeavoring
to
intercept
these
two
men
and
general
merritt
feared
that
they
would
accomplish
their
object
he
did
not
think
it
advisable
to
send
out
any
soldiers
to
the
assistance
of
the
couriers
for
fear
that
would
show
to
the
indians
that
there
were
troops
in
the
vicinity
who
were
waiting
for
them
i
finally
suggested
that
the
best
plan
was
to
wait
until
the
couriers
came
closer
to
the
command
and
then
just
as
the
indians
were
about
to
charge
to
let
me
take
the
scouts
and
cut
them
off
from
the
main
body
of
the
cheyennes
who
were
coming
over
the
divide
all
right
cody
said
the
general
if
you
can
do
that
go
ahead
i
rushed
back
to
the
command
jumped
on
my
horse
picked
out
fifteen
men
and
returned
with
them
to
the
point
of
observation
i
told
general
merritt
to
give
us
the
word
to
start
out
at
the
proper
time
and
presently
he
sang
out
go
in
now
cody
and
be
quick
about
it
they
are
going
to
charge
on
the
couriers
the
two
messengers
were
not
over
four
hundred
yards
from
us
and
the
indians
were
only
about
two
hundred
yards
behind
them
we
instantly
dashed
over
the
bluffs
and
advanced
on
a
gallop
towards
the
indians
a
running
fight
lasted
several
minutes
during
which
we
drove
the
enemy
some
little
distance
and
killed
three
of
their
number
the
rest
of
them
rode
off
towards
the
main
body
which
had
come
into
plain
sight
and
halted
upon
seeing
the
skirmish
that
was
going
on
we
were
about
half
a
mile
from
general
merritt
and
the
indians
whom
we
were
chasing
suddenly
turned
upon
us
and
another
lively
skirmish
took
place
one
of
the
indians
who
was
handsomely
decorated
with
all
the
ornaments
usually
worn
by
a
war
chief
when
engaged
in
a
fight
sang
out
to
me
in
his
own
tongue
i
know
you
if
you
want
to
fight
come
ahead
and
fight
me
the
chief
was
riding
his
horse
back
and
forth
in
front
of
his
men
as
if
to
banter
me
and
i
concluded
to
accept
the
challenge
i
galloped
towards
him
for
fifty
yards
and
he
advanced
towards
me
about
the
same
distance
both
of
us
riding
at
full
speed
and
then
when
we
were
only
about
thirty
yards
apart
i
raised
my
rifle
and
fired
his
horse
fell
to
the
ground
having
been
killed
by
my
bullet
almost
at
the
same
instant
my
own
horse
went
down
he
having
stepped
into
a
hole
the
fall
did
not
hurt
me
much
and
i
instantly
sprang
to
my
feet
the
indian
had
also
recovered
himself
and
we
were
now
both
on
foot
and
not
more
than
twenty
paces
apart
we
fired
at
each
other
simultaneously
my
usual
luck
did
not
desert
me
on
this
occasion
for
his
bullet
missed
me
while
mine
struck
him
in
the
breast
he
reeled
and
fell
but
before
he
had
fairly
touched
the
ground
i
was
upon
him
knife
in
hand
and
had
driven
the
weapon
to
its
hilt
in
his
heart
jerking
his
off
i
scientifically
scalped
him
in
about
five
seconds
the
whole
affair
from
beginning
to
end
occupied
but
little
time
and
the
indians
seeing
that
i
was
some
little
distance
from
my
company
now
came
charging
down
upon
me
from
a
hill
in
hopes
of
cutting
me
off
general
merritt
had
witnessed
the
duel
and
realizing
the
danger
i
was
in
ordered
colonel
mason
with
company
k
to
hurry
to
my
rescue
the
order
came
none
too
soon
for
had
it
been
given
one
minute
later
i
would
have
had
not
less
than
two
hundred
indians
upon
me
as
the
soldiers
came
up
i
swung
the
indian
chieftain
and
bonnet
in
the
air
and
shouted
first
scalp
for
general
merritt
seeing
that
he
could
not
now
ambush
the
indians
ordered
the
whole
regiment
to
charge
upon
them
they
made
a
stubborn
resistance
for
a
little
while
but
it
was
of
no
use
for
any
eight
hundred
or
even
sixteen
hundred
indians
to
try
and
check
a
charge
of
the
gallant
old
fifth
cavalry
and
they
soon
came
to
that
conclusion
and
began
a
running
retreat
towards
red
cloud
agency
for
miles
we
drove
them
pushing
them
so
hard
that
they
were
obliged
to
abandon
their
loose
horses
their
camp
equipage
and
everything
else
we
drove
them
into
the
agency
and
followed
in
ourselves
notwithstanding
the
possibility
of
our
having
to
encounter
the
thousands
of
indians
at
that
point
we
were
uncertain
whether
or
not
the
other
agency
indians
had
determined
to
follow
the
example
of
the
cheyennes
and
strike
out
upon
the
but
that
made
no
difference
with
the
fifth
cavalry
for
they
would
have
fought
them
all
if
necessary
it
was
dark
when
we
rode
into
the
agency
where
we
found
thousands
of
indians
collected
together
but
they
manifested
no
disposition
to
fight
illustration
a
duel
with
chief
yellow
hand
while
at
the
agency
i
learned
the
name
of
the
indian
chief
whom
i
had
killed
in
the
morning
it
was
yellow
hand
a
son
of
old
a
leading
chief
of
the
cheyennes
having
learned
that
i
had
killed
his
son
sent
a
white
interpreter
to
me
with
a
message
to
the
effect
that
he
would
give
me
four
mules
if
i
would
turn
over
to
him
yellow
hand
guns
pistols
ornaments
and
other
paraphernalia
which
i
had
captured
i
sent
back
word
to
the
old
gentleman
that
it
would
give
me
pleasure
to
accommodate
him
but
i
could
not
do
it
this
time
the
next
morning
we
started
to
join
general
crook
who
was
camped
near
the
foot
of
cloud
peak
in
the
big
horn
mountains
awaiting
the
arrival
of
the
fifth
cavalry
before
proceeding
against
the
sioux
who
were
somewhere
near
the
head
of
the
little
big
horn
as
his
scouts
informed
him
we
made
rapid
marches
and
reached
general
crook
camp
on
goose
creek
about
the
of
august
at
this
camp
i
met
many
old
friends
among
whom
was
colonel
royal
who
had
received
his
promotion
to
the
lieutenant
colonelcy
of
the
third
cavalry
he
introduced
me
to
general
crook
whom
i
had
never
met
before
but
of
whom
i
had
often
heard
he
also
introduced
me
to
the
chief
guide
frank
grouard
a
half
breed
who
had
lived
six
years
with
sitting
bull
and
knew
the
country
thoroughly
we
remained
in
this
camp
only
one
day
and
then
the
whole
troop
pulled
out
for
the
tongue
river
leaving
our
wagons
behind
but
taking
with
us
a
large
pack
train
we
marched
down
the
tongue
river
for
two
days
thence
in
a
westerly
direction
over
to
the
rosebud
where
we
struck
the
main
indian
trail
leading
down
this
stream
from
the
size
of
the
trail
which
appeared
to
be
about
four
days
old
we
estimated
that
there
must
have
been
in
the
neighborhood
of
seven
thousand
indians
who
had
made
the
broad
trail
at
this
point
we
were
overtaken
by
jack
crawford
familiarly
known
as
captain
jack
the
poet
scout
of
the
black
hills
and
right
here
i
will
insert
the
following
lines
written
by
him
just
after
the
custer
massacre
upon
receiving
from
me
the
following
dispatch
jack
old
boy
have
you
heard
of
the
death
of
custer
custer
death
did
i
hear
the
news
from
custer
well
i
reckon
i
did
old
pard
it
came
like
a
streak
of
lightnin
and
you
bet
it
hit
me
hard
i
ai
no
hand
to
blubber
and
the
briny
ai
run
for
years
but
chalk
me
down
for
a
lubber
if
i
did
shed
regular
tears
what
for
now
look
you
here
bill
you
a
bully
boy
that
true
as
good
as
wore
buckskin
or
fought
with
the
boys
in
blue
but
i
bet
my
bottom
dollar
ye
had
no
trouble
to
muster
a
tear
or
perhaps
a
hundred
at
the
news
of
the
death
of
custer
he
always
thought
well
of
you
pard
and
had
it
been
heaven
will
in
a
few
more
days
you
met
him
and
he
welcome
his
old
scout
bill
for
if
ye
remember
at
hat
creek
i
met
ye
with
general
carr
we
talked
of
the
brave
young
custer
and
recounted
his
deeds
of
war
but
little
we
knew
even
then
pard
and
that
just
two
weeks
ago
how
little
we
dreamed
of
disaster
or
that
he
had
met
the
foe
that
the
fearless
reckless
hero
so
loved
by
the
whole
frontier
had
died
on
the
field
of
battle
in
this
our
centennial
year
i
served
with
him
in
the
army
in
the
darkest
days
of
the
war
and
i
reckon
ye
know
his
record
for
he
was
our
guiding
star
and
the
boys
who
gathered
round
him
to
charge
in
the
early
morn
war
just
like
the
brave
who
perished
with
him
on
the
little
horn
and
where
is
the
satisfaction
and
how
will
the
boys
get
square
by
giving
the
reds
more
rifles
invite
them
to
take
more
hair
we
want
no
scouts
no
trappers
nor
men
who
know
the
frontier
phil
old
boy
you
mistaken
must
have
the
never
mind
that
two
hundred
thousand
but
give
us
a
hundred
instead
send
five
thousand
men
towards
reno
and
soon
we
wo
leave
a
red
it
will
save
uncle
sam
lots
of
money
in
fortress
we
need
not
invest
jest
wollup
the
devils
this
summer
and
the
miners
will
do
all
the
rest
the
black
hills
are
filled
with
miners
the
big
horn
will
soon
be
as
full
and
which
will
show
the
most
danger
to
crazy
horse
and
old
sitting
bull
a
band
of
ten
thousand
frontier
men
or
a
couple
of
forts
with
a
few
of
the
boys
in
the
east
now
enlisting
friend
cody
i
leave
it
with
you
they
talk
of
peace
with
these
demons
by
feeding
and
clothing
them
well
i
as
soon
think
an
angel
from
heaven
would
reign
with
contentment
in
h
l
and
one
day
the
quakers
will
answer
before
the
great
judge
of
us
all
for
the
death
of
daring
young
custer
and
the
boys
who
round
him
did
fall
perhaps
i
am
judging
them
harshly
but
i
mean
what
i
telling
ye
pard
i
letting
them
down
mighty
easy
perhaps
they
may
think
it
is
hard
but
i
tell
you
the
day
is
approaching
the
boys
are
beginning
to
muster
that
day
of
the
great
retribution
the
day
of
revenge
for
our
custer
and
i
will
be
with
you
friend
cody
my
weight
will
go
in
with
the
boys
i
shared
all
their
hardships
last
winter
i
shared
all
their
sorrows
and
joys
tell
them
i
coming
friend
william
i
trust
i
will
meet
you
ere
long
regards
to
the
boys
in
the
mountains
yours
ever
in
friendship
still
strong
jack
was
a
new
man
in
the
country
but
evidently
had
plenty
of
nerve
and
pluck
as
he
had
brought
dispatches
from
fort
fetterman
a
distance
of
miles
through
a
dangerous
indian
country
the
dispatches
were
for
general
crook
and
notified
him
that
general
terry
was
to
operate
with
a
large
command
south
of
the
yellowstone
and
that
the
two
commands
would
probably
consolidate
somewhere
on
the
rosebud
jack
at
once
hunted
me
up
and
gave
me
a
letter
from
general
sheridan
informing
me
that
he
had
appointed
him
jack
as
one
of
the
scouts
while
we
were
conversing
jack
informed
me
that
he
had
brought
me
a
present
from
colonel
jones
of
cheyenne
and
that
he
had
it
in
his
asking
the
nature
of
the
gift
he
replied
that
it
was
only
a
bottle
of
good
whiskey
i
placed
my
hand
over
his
mouth
and
told
him
to
keep
still
and
not
to
whisper
it
even
to
the
winds
for
there
were
too
many
dry
men
around
us
and
only
when
alone
with
him
did
i
dare
to
have
him
take
the
treasure
from
his
in
this
connection
i
may
remark
that
jack
crawford
is
the
only
man
i
have
ever
known
that
could
have
brought
that
bottle
of
whiskey
through
without
befalling
it
for
he
is
one
of
the
very
few
teetotal
scouts
i
ever
met
not
wishing
to
have
a
game
of
whiskey
i
invited
general
carr
to
sample
the
bottle
with
me
we
soon
found
a
secluded
spot
and
dismounting
we
thought
we
were
going
to
have
a
nice
little
drink
all
by
ourselves
when
who
should
ride
up
but
lathrop
the
reporter
of
the
associated
press
of
the
pacific
slope
to
whom
we
had
given
the
name
of
the
death
rattler
and
who
was
also
known
in
san
francisco
as
the
man
with
the
iron
jaw
he
having
with
the
true
nose
of
a
reporter
smelt
the
whiskey
from
afar
off
and
had
come
to
interview
it
he
was
a
good
fellow
withal
and
we
were
glad
to
have
him
join
us
now
to
resume
for
two
or
three
days
we
pushed
on
but
we
did
not
seem
to
gain
much
on
the
indians
as
they
were
evidently
making
about
the
same
marches
that
we
were
on
the
fourth
or
fifth
morning
of
our
pursuit
i
rode
ahead
of
the
command
about
ten
miles
and
mounting
a
hill
i
scanned
the
country
far
and
wide
with
my
field
glass
and
discovered
an
immense
column
of
dust
rising
about
ten
miles
further
down
the
creek
and
soon
i
noticed
a
body
of
men
marching
towards
me
that
at
first
i
believed
to
be
the
indians
of
whom
we
were
in
pursuit
but
subsequently
they
proved
to
be
general
terry
command
i
sent
back
word
to
that
effect
to
general
crook
by
a
scout
who
had
accompanied
me
but
after
he
had
departed
i
observed
a
band
of
indians
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
creek
and
also
another
party
directly
in
front
of
me
this
led
me
to
believe
that
i
had
made
a
mistake
but
shortly
afterwards
my
attention
was
attracted
by
the
appearance
of
a
body
of
soldiers
who
were
forming
into
a
skirmish
line
and
then
i
became
convinced
that
it
was
general
terry
command
after
all
and
that
the
whom
i
had
seen
were
some
of
his
friendly
indian
scouts
who
had
mistaken
me
for
a
sioux
and
fled
back
to
their
command
terribly
excited
shouting
the
sioux
are
coming
general
terry
at
once
came
to
the
post
and
ordered
the
seventh
cavalry
to
form
line
of
battle
across
the
rosebud
he
also
ordered
up
his
artillery
and
had
them
prepare
for
action
doubtless
dreading
another
custer
massacre
i
afterwards
learned
the
indians
had
seen
the
dust
raised
by
general
crook
forces
and
had
reported
that
the
sioux
were
coming
these
manoeuvres
i
witnessed
from
my
position
with
considerable
amusement
thinking
the
command
must
be
badly
demoralized
when
one
man
could
cause
a
whole
army
to
form
line
of
battle
and
prepare
for
action
having
enjoyed
the
situation
to
my
heart
content
i
galloped
down
towards
the
skirmish
line
waving
my
hat
and
when
within
about
one
hundred
yards
of
the
troops
colonel
weir
of
the
seventh
cavalry
galloped
out
and
met
me
he
recognized
me
at
once
and
accompanied
me
inside
the
line
then
he
sang
out
boys
here
buffalo
bill
some
of
you
old
soldiers
know
him
give
him
a
cheer
thereupon
the
regiment
gave
three
rousing
cheers
and
it
was
followed
up
all
along
the
line
colonel
weir
presented
me
to
general
terry
and
in
answer
to
his
questions
i
informed
him
that
the
alarm
of
indians
which
had
been
given
was
a
false
one
as
the
dust
seen
by
his
scouts
was
caused
by
general
crook
troops
general
terry
thereupon
rode
forward
to
meet
general
crook
and
i
accompanied
him
at
his
request
that
night
both
commands
went
into
camp
on
the
rosebud
general
terry
had
his
wagon
train
with
him
and
everything
to
make
life
comfortable
on
an
indian
campaign
he
had
large
wall
tents
and
portable
beds
to
sleep
in
and
large
hospital
tents
for
his
camp
looked
very
comfortable
and
attractive
and
presented
a
great
contrast
to
that
of
general
crook
who
had
for
his
headquarters
only
one
small
fly
tent
and
whose
cooking
utensils
consisted
of
a
quart
cup
in
which
he
made
his
coffee
himself
and
a
stick
upon
which
he
broiled
his
bacon
when
i
compared
the
two
camps
i
came
to
the
conclusion
that
general
crook
was
an
indian
fighter
for
it
was
evident
that
he
had
learned
that
to
follow
and
fight
indians
a
body
of
men
must
travel
lightly
and
not
be
detained
by
a
wagon
train
or
heavy
luggage
of
any
kind
that
evening
general
terry
ordered
general
miles
to
take
his
regiment
the
fifth
infantry
and
return
by
a
forced
march
to
the
yellowstone
and
proceed
down
that
river
by
steamboat
to
the
mouth
of
powder
river
to
intercept
the
indians
in
case
they
attempted
to
cross
the
yellowstone
general
mills
made
a
forced
march
that
night
of
miles
which
was
splendid
traveling
for
an
infantry
regiment
through
a
mountainous
country
generals
crook
and
terry
spent
that
evening
and
the
next
day
in
council
and
on
the
following
morning
both
commands
moved
out
on
the
indian
trail
although
general
terry
was
the
senior
officer
he
did
not
assume
command
of
both
expeditions
but
left
general
crook
in
command
of
his
own
troops
although
they
operated
together
we
crossed
the
tongue
river
to
powder
river
and
proceeded
down
the
latter
stream
to
a
point
twenty
miles
from
its
junction
with
the
yellowstone
where
the
indian
trail
turned
to
the
southeast
in
the
direction
of
the
black
hills
the
two
commands
now
being
nearly
out
of
supplies
the
trail
was
abandoned
and
the
troops
kept
on
down
powder
river
to
its
confluence
with
the
yellowstone
and
remained
there
several
days
here
we
met
general
mills
who
reported
that
no
indians
had
as
yet
crossed
the
yellowstone
several
steamboats
soon
arrived
with
a
large
quantity
of
supplies
and
once
more
the
boys
in
blue
were
made
happy
chapter
xxxi
dangerous
work
one
evening
while
we
were
in
camp
on
the
yellowstone
at
the
mouth
of
powder
river
i
was
informed
that
the
commanding
officers
had
selected
louis
richard
a
half
breed
and
myself
to
accompany
general
mills
on
a
scouting
expedition
on
the
steamer
far
west
down
the
yellowstone
as
far
as
glendive
creek
we
were
to
ride
on
the
pilot
house
and
keep
a
sharp
lookout
on
both
sides
of
the
river
for
indian
trails
that
might
have
crossed
the
stream
the
idea
of
scouting
on
a
steamboat
was
indeed
a
novel
one
to
me
and
i
anticipated
a
pleasant
trip
at
daylight
next
morning
we
reported
on
board
the
steamer
to
general
mills
who
had
with
him
four
or
five
companies
of
his
regiment
we
were
somewhat
surprised
when
he
asked
us
where
our
horses
were
as
we
had
not
supposed
that
horses
would
be
needed
if
the
scouting
was
to
be
done
on
the
steamer
he
said
we
might
need
them
before
we
got
back
and
thereupon
we
had
the
animals
brought
on
board
in
a
few
minutes
we
were
booming
down
the
river
at
the
rate
of
about
twenty
miles
an
hour
the
steamer
far
west
was
commanded
by
captain
grant
marsh
whom
i
found
to
be
a
brick
i
had
often
heard
of
him
for
he
was
and
is
yet
one
of
the
best
known
river
captains
in
the
country
he
it
was
who
with
his
steamer
the
far
west
transported
the
wounded
men
from
the
battle
of
the
little
big
horn
to
fort
abraham
lincoln
on
the
missouri
river
and
on
that
trip
he
made
the
fastest
steamboat
time
on
record
he
was
a
skillful
and
experienced
pilot
handling
his
boat
with
remarkable
dexterity
while
richard
and
myself
were
at
our
stations
on
the
pilot
house
the
steamer
with
a
full
head
of
steam
went
flying
past
islands
around
bends
over
sand
bars
at
a
rate
that
was
exhilarating
presently
i
thought
i
could
see
horses
grazing
in
a
distant
bend
of
the
river
and
i
reported
the
fact
to
general
mills
who
asked
captain
marsh
if
he
could
land
the
boat
near
a
large
tree
which
he
pointed
out
to
him
illustration
scouting
on
a
steamboat
yes
sir
i
can
land
her
there
and
make
her
climb
the
tree
if
necessary
said
he
on
reaching
the
spot
designated
general
mills
ordered
two
companies
ashore
while
richard
and
myself
were
ordered
to
take
our
horses
off
the
boat
and
push
out
as
rapidly
as
possible
to
see
if
there
were
indians
in
the
vicinity
while
we
were
getting
ashore
captain
marsh
remarked
that
if
there
was
only
a
good
heavy
dew
on
the
grass
he
would
shoot
the
steamer
ashore
and
take
us
on
the
scout
without
the
trouble
of
leaving
the
boat
it
was
a
false
alarm
however
as
the
objects
we
had
seen
proved
to
be
indian
graves
quite
a
large
number
of
braves
who
had
probably
been
killed
in
some
battle
had
been
buried
on
scaffolds
according
to
the
indian
custom
and
some
of
their
clothing
had
been
torn
loose
from
the
bodies
by
the
wolves
and
was
waving
in
the
air
on
arriving
at
glendive
creek
we
found
that
colonel
rice
and
his
company
of
the
fifth
infantry
who
had
been
sent
there
by
general
mills
had
built
quite
a
good
little
fort
with
their
a
weapon
which
colonel
rice
was
the
inventor
of
and
which
is
by
the
way
a
very
useful
implement
of
war
as
it
can
be
used
for
a
shovel
in
throwing
up
intrenchments
and
can
be
profitably
utilized
in
several
other
ways
on
the
day
previous
to
our
arrival
colonel
rice
had
a
fight
with
a
party
of
indians
and
had
killed
two
or
three
of
them
at
long
range
with
his
rodman
cannon
the
far
west
was
to
remain
at
glendive
over
night
and
general
mills
wished
to
send
dispatches
back
to
general
terry
at
once
at
his
request
i
took
the
dispatches
and
rode
miles
that
night
through
the
bad
lands
of
the
yellowstone
and
reached
general
terry
camp
next
morning
after
having
nearly
broken
my
neck
a
dozen
times
or
more
there
being
but
little
prospect
of
any
more
fighting
i
determined
to
go
east
as
soon
as
possible
to
organize
a
new
dramatic
combination
and
have
a
new
drama
written
for
me
based
upon
the
sioux
war
this
i
knew
would
be
a
paying
investment
as
the
sioux
campaign
had
excited
considerable
interest
so
i
started
down
the
river
on
the
steamer
yellowstone
to
fort
beauford
on
the
same
morning
generals
terry
and
crook
pulled
out
for
powder
river
to
take
up
the
old
indian
trail
which
we
had
recently
left
the
steamer
had
proceeded
down
the
stream
about
twenty
miles
when
it
was
met
by
another
boat
on
its
way
up
the
river
having
on
board
general
whistler
and
some
fresh
troops
for
general
terry
command
both
boats
landed
and
almost
the
first
person
i
met
was
my
old
friend
and
partner
texas
jack
who
had
been
sent
out
as
a
dispatch
carrier
for
the
york
general
whistler
upon
learning
that
general
terry
had
left
the
yellowstone
asked
me
to
carry
to
him
some
important
dispatches
from
general
sheridan
and
although
i
objected
he
insisted
upon
my
performing
this
duty
saying
that
it
would
only
detain
me
a
few
hours
longer
as
an
extra
inducement
he
offered
me
the
use
of
his
own
horse
which
was
on
the
boat
i
finally
consented
to
go
and
was
soon
speeding
over
the
rough
and
hilly
country
towards
powder
river
and
i
delivered
the
dispatches
to
general
terry
that
same
evening
general
horse
although
a
good
animal
was
not
used
to
such
hard
riding
and
was
far
more
exhausted
by
the
journey
than
i
was
after
i
had
taken
a
lunch
general
terry
asked
me
if
i
would
carry
some
dispatches
back
to
general
whistler
and
i
replied
that
i
would
captain
smith
general
terry
offered
me
his
horse
for
the
trip
and
it
proved
to
be
an
excellent
animal
for
i
rode
him
that
same
night
forty
miles
over
the
bad
lands
in
four
hours
and
reached
general
whistler
steamboat
at
one
during
my
absence
the
indians
had
made
their
appearance
on
the
different
hills
in
the
vicinity
and
the
troops
from
the
boat
had
had
several
skirmishes
with
them
when
general
whistler
had
finished
reading
the
dispatches
he
said
cody
i
want
to
send
information
to
general
terry
concerning
the
indians
who
have
been
skirmishing
around
here
all
day
i
have
been
trying
all
the
evening
long
to
induce
some
one
to
carry
my
dispatches
to
him
but
no
one
seems
willing
to
undertake
the
trip
and
i
have
got
to
fall
back
on
you
it
is
asking
a
great
deal
i
know
as
you
have
just
ridden
eighty
miles
but
it
is
a
case
of
necessity
and
if
you
go
cody
i
see
that
you
are
well
paid
for
it
never
mind
about
the
pay
said
i
but
get
your
dispatches
ready
and
i
start
at
once
in
a
few
minutes
he
handed
me
the
package
and
mounting
the
same
horse
which
i
had
ridden
from
general
terry
camp
i
struck
out
for
my
destination
it
was
two
in
the
morning
when
i
left
the
boat
and
at
eight
i
rode
into
general
terry
camp
just
as
he
was
about
to
march
having
made
one
hundred
and
twenty
miles
in
hours
general
terry
after
reading
the
dispatches
halted
his
command
and
then
rode
on
and
overtook
general
crook
with
whom
he
held
a
council
the
result
was
that
crook
command
moved
on
in
the
direction
which
they
had
been
pursuing
while
terry
forces
marched
back
to
the
yellowstone
and
crossed
the
river
on
steamboats
at
the
urgent
request
of
general
terry
i
accompanied
the
command
on
a
scout
in
the
direction
of
the
dry
fork
of
the
missouri
where
it
was
expected
we
would
strike
some
indians
the
first
march
out
from
the
yellowstone
was
made
in
the
night
as
we
wished
to
get
into
the
hills
without
being
discovered
by
the
sioux
scouts
after
marching
three
days
a
little
to
the
east
of
north
we
reached
the
buffalo
range
and
discovered
fresh
signs
of
indians
who
had
evidently
been
killing
buffaloes
general
terry
now
called
on
me
to
carry
dispatches
to
colonel
rice
who
was
still
camped
at
the
mouth
of
glendive
creek
on
the
yellowstone
distant
about
eighty
miles
from
us
night
had
set
in
with
a
storm
and
a
drizzling
rain
was
falling
when
at
ten
i
started
on
this
ride
through
a
section
of
country
with
which
i
was
entirely
unacquainted
i
traveled
through
the
darkness
a
distance
of
about
miles
and
at
daylight
i
rode
into
a
secluded
spot
at
the
head
of
a
ravine
where
stood
a
bunch
of
ash
trees
and
there
i
concluded
to
remain
till
night
for
i
considered
it
a
dangerous
undertaking
to
cross
the
wide
prairies
in
broad
daylight
especially
as
my
horse
was
a
poor
one
illustration
close
quarters
i
accordingly
unsaddled
my
animal
and
ate
a
hearty
breakfast
of
bacon
and
hard
tack
which
i
had
stored
in
the
then
after
taking
a
smoke
i
lay
down
to
sleep
with
my
saddle
for
a
pillow
in
a
few
minutes
i
was
in
the
land
of
dreams
after
sleeping
some
time
i
ca
tell
how
long
i
was
suddenly
awakened
by
a
roaring
rumbling
sound
i
instantly
seized
my
gun
sprang
to
my
horse
and
hurriedly
secreted
him
in
the
brush
then
i
climbed
up
the
steep
side
of
the
bank
and
cautiously
looked
over
the
summit
in
the
distance
i
saw
a
large
herd
of
buffaloes
which
were
being
chased
and
fired
at
by
twenty
or
thirty
indians
occasionally
a
buffalo
would
drop
out
of
the
herd
but
the
indians
kept
on
until
they
had
killed
ten
or
fifteen
they
then
turned
back
and
began
to
cut
up
their
game
i
saddled
my
horse
and
tied
him
to
a
small
tree
where
i
could
reach
him
conveniently
in
case
the
indians
should
discover
me
by
finding
my
trail
and
following
it
i
then
crawled
carefully
back
to
the
summit
of
the
bluff
and
in
a
concealed
position
watched
the
indians
for
two
hours
during
which
time
they
were
occupied
in
cutting
up
the
buffaloes
and
packing
the
meat
on
their
ponies
when
they
had
finished
this
work
they
rode
off
in
the
direction
whence
they
had
come
and
on
the
line
which
i
had
proposed
to
travel
it
appeared
evident
to
me
that
their
camp
was
located
somewhere
between
me
and
glendive
creek
but
i
had
no
idea
of
abandoning
the
trip
on
that
account
i
waited
till
nightfall
before
resuming
my
journey
and
then
i
bore
off
to
the
east
for
several
miles
and
by
making
a
to
avoid
the
indians
i
got
back
on
my
original
course
and
then
pushed
on
rapidly
to
colonel
rice
camp
which
i
reached
just
at
daylight
colonel
rice
had
been
fighting
indians
almost
every
day
since
he
had
been
encamped
at
this
point
and
he
was
very
anxious
to
notify
general
terry
of
the
fact
of
course
i
was
requested
to
carry
his
dispatches
after
remaining
at
glendive
a
single
day
i
started
back
to
find
general
terry
and
on
the
third
day
out
i
overhauled
him
at
the
head
of
deer
creek
while
on
his
way
to
colonel
rice
camp
he
was
not
however
going
in
the
right
direction
but
bearing
too
far
to
the
east
and
i
so
informed
him
he
then
asked
me
to
guide
the
command
and
i
did
so
on
arriving
at
glendive
i
bade
to
the
general
and
his
officers
and
took
passage
on
the
steamer
far
west
which
was
on
her
way
down
the
missouri
at
bismarck
i
left
the
steamer
and
proceeded
by
rail
to
rochester
new
york
where
i
met
my
family
clinton
hall
manager
of
the
rochester
opera
house
was
very
anxious
to
have
me
play
an
engagement
at
his
theatre
i
agreed
to
open
the
season
with
him
as
soon
as
i
had
got
my
drama
written
and
i
did
so
meeting
with
an
enthusiastic
reception
my
new
drama
was
arranged
for
the
stage
by
arlington
the
actor
it
was
a
play
without
head
or
tail
and
it
made
no
difference
at
which
act
we
commenced
the
performance
before
we
had
finished
the
season
several
newspaper
critics
i
have
been
told
went
crazy
in
trying
to
follow
the
plot
it
afforded
us
however
ample
opportunity
to
give
a
noisy
rattling
gunpowder
entertainment
and
to
present
a
succession
of
scenes
in
the
late
indian
war
all
of
which
seemed
to
give
general
satisfaction
from
rochester
i
went
to
new
york
and
played
a
very
successful
engagement
at
the
grand
opera
house
under
the
management
of
poole
and
donnelly
thence
my
route
took
me
to
all
the
principal
cities
in
the
eastern
western
and
middle
states
and
i
everywhere
met
with
crowded
houses
i
then
went
to
the
pacific
coast
against
the
advice
of
friends
who
gave
it
as
their
opinion
that
my
style
of
plays
would
not
take
very
well
in
california
i
opened
for
an
engagement
of
two
weeks
at
the
bush
street
theatre
in
san
francisco
at
a
season
when
the
theatrical
business
was
dull
and
ben
debar
and
the
lingards
were
playing
there
to
empty
seats
i
expected
to
play
to
a
slim
audience
on
the
opening
night
but
instead
of
that
i
had
a
fourteen
hundred
dollar
house
such
was
my
success
that
i
continued
my
engagement
for
five
weeks
and
the
theatre
was
crowded
at
every
performance
upon
leaving
san
francisco
i
made
a
circuit
of
the
interior
towns
and
closed
the
season
at
virginia
city
nevada
on
my
way
east
i
met
my
family
at
denver
where
they
were
visiting
my
sisters
nellie
and
may
who
were
then
residing
there
some
time
previously
i
had
made
arrangements
to
go
into
the
cattle
business
in
company
with
my
old
friend
major
frank
north
and
while
i
was
in
california
he
had
built
our
ranches
on
the
south
fork
of
the
dismal
river
miles
north
of
north
platte
in
nebraska
proceeding
to
ogalalla
the
headquarters
of
the
texas
cattle
drovers
i
found
major
north
there
awaiting
me
and
together
we
bought
branded
and
drove
to
our
ranches
our
first
installment
of
cattle
this
occupied
us
during
the
remainder
of
the
summer
leaving
the
cattle
in
charge
of
major
north
i
visited
red
cloud
agency
early
in
the
fall
and
secured
some
sioux
indians
to
accompany
me
on
my
theatrical
tour
of
taking
my
family
and
the
indians
with
me
i
went
directly
to
rochester
there
i
left
my
oldest
daughter
arta
at
a
young
ladies
seminary
while
my
wife
and
youngest
child
traveled
with
me
during
the
season
i
opened
at
the
bowery
theatre
new
york
september
with
a
new
border
drama
entitled
may
cody
or
lost
and
won
from
the
pen
of
major
burt
of
the
united
states
army
it
was
founded
on
the
incidents
of
the
mountain
meadow
massacre
and
life
among
the
mormons
it
was
the
best
drama
i
had
yet
produced
and
proved
a
grand
success
both
financially
and
artistically
the
season
of
proved
to
be
the
most
profitable
one
i
had
ever
had
in
february
my
wife
became
tired
of
traveling
and
proceeded
to
north
platte
nebraska
where
on
our
farm
adjoining
the
town
she
personally
superintended
the
erection
of
a
comfortable
family
residence
and
had
it
all
completed
when
i
reached
there
early
in
may
in
this
house
we
are
now
living
and
we
hope
to
make
it
our
home
for
many
years
to
come
chapter
xxxii
conclusion
after
my
arrival
at
north
platte
i
found
that
the
ranchmen
or
had
organized
a
regular
annual
to
take
place
in
the
spring
of
the
year
the
word
is
derived
from
the
fact
that
during
the
winter
months
the
cattle
become
scattered
over
a
vast
tract
of
land
and
the
ranchmen
assemble
together
in
the
spring
to
sort
out
and
each
secure
his
own
stock
they
form
a
large
circle
often
of
a
circumference
of
two
hundred
miles
and
drive
the
cattle
towards
a
common
centre
where
all
the
stock
being
branded
each
owner
can
readily
separate
his
own
from
the
general
herd
and
then
he
drives
them
to
his
own
ranch
in
this
cattle
driving
business
is
exhibited
some
most
magnificent
horsemanship
for
the
as
they
are
called
are
invariably
skillful
and
fearless
horsemen
in
fact
only
a
most
expert
rider
could
be
a
as
it
requires
the
greatest
dexterity
and
daring
in
the
saddle
to
cut
a
wild
steer
out
of
the
herd
major
north
was
awaiting
me
upon
my
arrival
at
north
platte
having
with
him
our
own
horses
and
men
other
cattle
owners
such
as
keith
and
barton
coe
and
carter
jack
pratt
the
walker
brothers
guy
and
sim
lang
arnold
and
ritchie
and
a
great
many
others
with
their
outfits
were
assembled
and
were
ready
to
start
on
the
my
old
friend
dave
perry
who
had
presented
buckskin
joe
to
me
and
who
resided
at
north
platte
was
most
anxious
to
go
with
us
for
pleasure
and
frank
north
told
him
he
could
and
have
plenty
of
fun
provided
he
would
furnish
his
own
horses
provisions
and
bedding
and
do
the
usual
work
required
of
a
this
dave
was
willing
to
undertake
we
found
him
to
be
a
good
fellow
in
camp
and
excellent
company
as
there
is
nothing
but
hard
work
on
these
having
to
be
in
the
saddle
all
day
and
standing
guard
over
the
cattle
at
night
rain
or
shine
i
could
not
possibly
find
out
where
the
fun
came
in
that
north
had
promised
me
but
it
was
an
exciting
life
and
the
days
sped
rapidly
by
in
six
weeks
we
found
ourselves
at
our
own
ranch
on
dismal
river
the
having
proved
a
great
success
as
we
had
found
all
our
cattle
and
driven
them
home
this
work
being
over
i
proposed
to
spend
a
few
weeks
with
my
family
at
north
platte
for
the
purpose
of
making
their
better
acquaintance
for
my
long
and
continued
absence
from
home
made
me
a
comparative
stranger
under
my
own
one
great
source
of
pleasure
to
me
was
that
my
wife
was
delighted
with
the
home
i
had
given
her
amid
the
prairies
of
the
far
west
soon
after
my
arrival
my
sisters
nellie
and
may
came
to
make
us
a
visit
and
a
delightful
time
we
all
had
during
their
stay
when
they
left
us
i
accompanied
them
to
their
home
in
denver
colorado
where
i
passed
several
days
visiting
old
friends
and
scenes
returning
to
ogallala
i
purchased
from
bill
phant
an
extensive
cattle
drover
from
texas
a
herd
of
cattle
which
i
drove
to
my
ranch
on
the
dismal
river
after
which
i
bade
my
partner
and
the
boys
and
started
for
the
indian
territory
to
procure
indians
for
my
dramatic
combination
for
the
season
of
to
the
territory
i
paid
a
long
promised
visit
to
my
sisters
julia
goodman
and
eliza
george
myers
who
reside
in
kansas
the
state
which
the
reader
will
remember
was
my
boyhood
home
having
secured
my
indian
actors
and
along
with
them
o
burgess
a
government
interpreter
and
ed
burgess
known
as
the
boy
chief
of
the
pawnees
i
started
for
baltimore
where
i
organized
my
combination
and
which
was
the
largest
troupe
i
had
yet
had
on
the
road
opening
in
that
city
at
the
opera
house
under
the
management
of
hon
john
ford
and
then
started
on
a
southern
tour
playing
in
washington
richmond
and
as
far
south
as
savannah
georgia
where
we
were
brought
to
a
sudden
halt
owing
to
the
yellow
fever
which
was
then
cruelly
raging
in
the
beautiful
cities
of
the
land
of
the
cotton
and
the
cane
illustration
one
of
the
troupe
while
playing
in
washington
i
suddenly
learned
from
a
reporter
washington
newspaper
men
know
everything
that
my
indians
were
to
be
seized
by
the
government
and
sent
back
to
their
agency
finding
that
there
was
foundation
for
the
rumor
i
at
once
sought
general
carl
shurz
secretary
of
the
interior
and
asked
him
if
he
intended
depriving
me
of
my
indian
actors
he
said
that
he
did
as
the
indians
were
away
from
their
reservation
without
leave
i
answered
that
i
had
had
indians
with
me
the
year
before
and
nothing
had
been
said
about
it
but
commissioner
haight
replied
that
the
indians
were
the
wards
of
the
government
and
were
not
allowed
off
of
their
reservation
i
told
the
commissioner
that
the
indians
were
frequently
off
of
their
reservations
out
west
as
i
had
a
distinct
remembrance
of
meeting
them
upon
several
occasions
on
the
war
path
and
furthermore
i
thought
i
was
benefitting
the
indians
as
well
as
the
government
by
taking
them
all
over
the
united
states
and
giving
them
a
correct
idea
of
the
customs
life
of
the
pale
faces
so
that
when
they
returned
to
their
people
they
could
make
known
all
they
had
seen
after
a
conversation
with
the
secretary
of
the
interior
the
commissioner
concluded
to
allow
me
to
retain
the
indians
by
appointing
me
indian
agent
provided
i
would
give
the
necessary
bonds
and
pledge
myself
to
return
them
in
safety
to
their
agency
which
terms
i
agreed
to
from
savannah
georgia
having
changed
my
route
on
account
of
the
yellow
fever
i
jumped
my
entire
company
to
philadelphia
and
at
once
continued
on
a
tour
having
arranged
with
the
author
and
dramatist
colonel
prentiss
ingraham
to
write
a
play
for
me
the
drama
entitled
the
knight
of
the
plains
or
buffalo
bill
best
trail
was
first
produced
at
new
haven
it
has
proved
a
great
success
and
i
expect
to
play
it
in
england
where
i
purpose
to
go
next
season
on
a
theatrical
tour
having
been
urged
to
do
so
by
my
many
friends
abroad
after
a
successful
tour
of
six
weeks
on
the
pacific
slope
thus
ending
the
season
of
i
am
at
my
home
at
north
platte
nebraska
for
the
summer
and
thus
ends
the
account
of
my
career
as
far
as
it
has
gone
the
end
