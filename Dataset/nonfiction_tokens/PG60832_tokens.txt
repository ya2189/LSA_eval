the
very
foundation

the

commonwealth
is
the
proper
bringing
up
of
the
preface
many
years
ago
i
proposed
to
my
friend
quick
to
rewrite
his
educational
reformers
making
some
additions
sturm
and
froebel
for
example
and
allow
me
to
place
it
in
this
series
of
educational
works
i
had
read
his
essays
when
they
first
appeared
and
noted
their
great
value
as
a
contribution
to
the
right
kind
of
educational
literature
they
showed
admirable
tact
in
the
selection
of
the
materials
the
writers
were
chosen
and
the
things
that
had
been
said
and
done
of
permanent
value
were
brought
forward
better
than
all
was
the
running
commentary
on
these
materials
by
quick
himself
his
style
was
popular
taking
the
reader
as
it
were
into
confidential
relations
with
him
from
the
start
and
offering
now
and
then
a
word
of
criticism
in
the
most
judicial
spirit
leaning
neither
to
the
extreme
of
destructive
radicalism
which
seeks
revolution
rather
than
reform
nor
on
the
other
hand
to
the
extreme
of
blind
conservatism
which
wishes
to
preserve
the
vesture
of
the
past
rather
than
its
wisdom
i
have
called
this
book
of
quick
the
most
valuable
history
of
education
in
our
fit
only
to
be
compared
with
karl
von
geschichte
der
pädagogik
for
its
presentation
of
essentials
and
for
the
sanity
of
its
verdicts
i
made
my
proposal
that
he
his
book
because
i
knew
that
he
considered
his
first
edition
hastily
written
and
in
many
respects
not
adequate
to
the
ideal
he
had
conceived
of
the
book
i
knew
moreover
that
years
of
continued
thinking
on
a
theme
necessarily
modifies
views
he
would
wish
to
make
some
changes
in
matter
presented
some
in
judgments
rendered
and
many
more
in
style
of
presentation
hence
it
has
come
about
that
after
this
lapse
of
time
quick
has
produced
a
substantially
new
book
which
retaining
all
or
nearly
all
of
the
admirable
features
of
the
first
edition
has
brought
up
to
their
standard
of
excellence
many
others
the
history
of
education
is
a
vast
field
and
we
are
accustomed
to
demand
bulky
treatises
as
the
only
adequate
ones
but
the
obvious
disadvantage
of
such
works
has
led
to
the
clearly
defined
ideal
of
a
book
like
which
separates
the
gold
from
the
dross
and
offers
it
small
in
bulk
but
precious
in
value
the
educational
reformers
are
the
men
above
all
others
who
stimulate
us
to
think
about
education
every
one
of
these
was
an
extremist
and
erred
in
his
judgment
as
to
the
value
of
the
methods
which
prevailed
in
his
time
and
also
overestimated
the
effects
of
the
new
education
that
he
proposed
in
the
place
of
the
old
but
thought
begins
with
negations
and
originality
shows
itself
first
not
in
creating
something
new
but
in
removing
the
fettering
limitations
of
its
existing
environment
the
old
is
good
and
its
bad
are
condemned
alike
it
has
been
imposed
on
us
by
authority
and
we
have
not
been
allowed
to
summon
it
before
the
bar
of
our
reason
and
ask
of
it
its
credentials
it
informs
us
that
it
presented
these
credentials
ages
ago
to
our
older
and
wiser
than
we
are
such
imposition
of
authority
leaves
us
no
choice
but
to
revolt
we
too
have
a
right
to
think
as
well
as
our
ancestors
we
too
must
clear
up
the
ground
of
our
belief
and
substitute
insight
for
blind
faith
in
tradition
these
educational
reformers
are
prophets
of
the
period
of
revolution
against
mere
authority
while
we
are
inspired
to
think
for
ourselves
however
we
must
not
neglect
that
more
important
matter
of
thinking
the
truth
if
it
does
not
reach
the
truth
is
not
of
great
value
it
sets
itself
as
puny
individual
against
the
might
of
the
race
which
preserves
its
experience
in
the
forms
of
family
the
social
organism
the
state
the
church
hence
our
wiser
and
more
scientific
method
studies
everything
that
is
or
exists
in
its
history
and
endeavors
to
discover
how
it
came
to
be
what
it
is
it
inquires
into
its
evolution
the
essential
truth
is
not
the
present
fact
but
the
entire
process
by
which
the
present
fact
grew
to
be
what
it
is
for
the
living
force
that
made
the
present
fact
made
also
the
past
facts
antecedent
to
the
present
and
it
will
go
on
making
subsequent
facts
the
revelation
of
the
living
forces
which
make
the
facts
of
existence
is
the
object
of
science
it
takes
all
these
facts
to
reveal
the
living
force
that
is
acting
and
producing
them
hence
the
scientific
attitude
is
superior
to
the
attitude
of
these
educational
reformers
and
we
shall
in
our
own
minds
weigh
these
men
in
our
scales
asking
first
of
all
what
is
their
view
of
the
world
how
much
do
they
value
human
institutions
how
much
do
they
know
of
the
substantial
good
that
is
wrought
by
those
institutions
if
they
know
nothing
of
these
things
if
they
see
only
incumbrance
in
these
institutions
if
to
them
the
individual
is
the
measure
of
all
things
we
can
not
do
reverence
to
their
proposed
remedies
but
must
account
their
value
to
us
chiefly
this
that
they
have
stimulated
us
to
thinking
and
helped
us
to
discover
what
they
have
not
the
positive
value
of
institutions
all
education
deals
with
the
boundary
between
ignorance
and
knowledge
and
between
bad
habits
and
good
ones
the
pupil
as
pupil
brings
with
him
the
ignorance
and
the
bad
habits
and
is
engaged
in
acquiring
good
habits
and
correct
knowledge
this
situation
gives
us
a
general
recipe
for
a
frequently
recurring
type
of
educational
reformer
any
reformer
may
take
his
stand
on
the
boundary
mentioned
and
casting
an
angry
look
at
the
realm
of
ignorance
and
bad
habit
not
yet
conquered
condemn
in
wholesale
terms
the
system
of
education
that
has
not
been
efficient
in
removing
this
mental
and
moral
darkness
such
a
reformer
selects
an
examination
paper
written
by
a
pupil
whose
ignorance
is
not
yet
vanquished
and
parades
the
same
as
a
product
of
the
work
of
the
school
taking
great
pains
to
avoid
an
accurate
and
just
admeasurement
of
the
actual
work
done
by
the
school
the
reformer
critic
assumes
that
there
is
one
factor
here
whereas
there
are
three
the
native
and
acquired
powers
of
learning
his
actual
knowledge
acquired
and
the
instruction
given
by
the
school
the
school
is
not
responsible
for
the
first
and
second
of
these
factors
but
it
is
responsible
only
for
what
increment
has
grown
under
its
tutelage
how
much
and
what
has
the
pupil
increased
his
knowledge
and
how
much
his
power
of
acquiring
knowledge
and
of
doing
the
educational
reformer
is
always
telling
us
to
leave
words
and
take
up
things
he
dissuades
from
the
study
of
language
and
also
undervalues
the
knowledge
of
manners
and
customs
and
laws
and
usages
he
dislikes
the
study
of
institutions
even
he
nature
as
he
informs
us
herbert
spencer
wants
us
to
study
the
body
and
to
be
more
interested
in
biology
than
in
formal
logic
more
interested
in
natural
history
than
in
literature
but
i
think
he
would
be
indignant
if
one
were
to
ask
him
whether
he
thought
the
study
of
the
habits
and
social
instincts
of
bees
and
ants
is
less
important
than
the
study
of
insect
anatomy
and
physiology
anatomy
and
physiology
are
of
course
important
but
the
social
organism
is
more
important
than
the
physiological
organism
even
in
bees
and
ants
so
in
man
the
social
organism
is
transcendent
as
compared
with
human
physiology
and
social
hygiene
compared
with
physiological
hygiene
is
supreme
to
suppose
that
the
habits
of
plants
and
insects
are
facts
and
that
the
structure
of
human
languages
the
logical
structure
of
the
mind
itself
as
revealed
in
the
figures
and
modes
of
the
syllogism
and
the
manners
and
customs
of
social
life
the
deep
ethical
principles
which
govern
peoples
as
revealed
in
works
of
suppose
that
these
and
the
like
of
these
are
not
real
facts
and
worthy
of
study
is
one
of
the
strangest
delusions
that
has
ever
prevailed
but
it
is
a
worse
delusion
to
suppose
that
the
study
of
nature
is
more
practical
than
the
study
of
man
though
this
is
often
enough
claimed
by
the
educational
reformers
the
knowledge
of
most
worth
is
first
and
foremost
the
knowledge
of
how
to
knowledge
of
social
customs
and
usages
any
person
totally
ignorant
in
this
regard
would
not
escape
i
should
say
one
day
in
any
city
of
the
in
london
in
pekin
in
timbuctoo
or
in
a
of
arizona
a
knowledge
of
human
customs
and
usages
next
a
knowledge
of
human
views
of
nature
and
are
of
primordial
necessity
to
an
individual
and
are
means
of
direct
the
old
trivium
or
threefold
course
of
study
at
the
university
taught
grammar
logic
and
the
structure
of
language
the
structure
of
mind
and
the
art
of
reasoning
the
principles
and
art
of
persuasion
these
may
be
seen
at
once
to
be
lofty
subjects
and
worthy
objects
of
science
they
will
always
remain
such
but
they
are
not
easy
for
the
child
in
the
course
of
mastering
them
he
must
learn
to
master
himself
and
gain
great
intellectual
stature
pedagogy
has
wisely
graded
the
road
to
these
heights
and
placed
much
easier
studies
at
the
beginning
and
also
made
the
studies
more
various
improvements
in
methods
and
in
for
interesting
the
essential
to
his
for
these
we
have
to
thank
the
educational
reformers
harris

preface
to
edition
of
is
clear
that
in
whatever
it
is
our
duty
to
act
those
matters
also
it
is
our
duty
to
these
words
of
seem
to
me
incontrovertible
so
a
sense
of
duty
as
well
as
fondness
for
the
subject
has
led
me
to
devote
a
period
of
leisure
to
the
study
of
in
the
practice
of
which
i
have
been
for
some
years
engaged
there
are
countries
where
it
would
be
considered
a
truism
that
a
teacher
in
order
to
exercise
his
profession
intelligently
should
know
something
about
the
chief
authorities
in
it
here
however
i
suppose
such
an
assertion
will
seem
paradoxical
but
there
is
a
good
deal
to
be
said
in
defence
of
it
de
quincey
has
pointed
out
that
a
man
who
takes
up
any
pursuit
without
knowing
what
advances
others
have
made
in
it
works
at
a
great
disadvantage
he
does
not
apply
his
strength
in
the
right
direction
he
troubles
himself
about
small
matters
and
neglects
great
he
falls
into
errors
that
have
long
since
been
exploded
an
educator
is
i
think
liable
to
these
dangers
if
he
brings
to
his
task
no
knowledge
but
that
which
he
learnt
for
the
tripos
and
no
skill
but
that
which
he
acquired
in
the
cricket
ground
or
on
the
river
if
his
pupils
are
placed
entirely
in
his
hands
his
work
is
one
of
great
difficulty
with
heavy
penalties
attached
to
all
blundering
in
it
though
here
as
in
the
case
of
the
ignorant
doctor
and
the
careless
architect
the
penalties
unfortunately
are
paid
by
his
victims
if
as
more
commonly
happens
he
has
simply
to
give
a
class
prescribed
instruction
his
smaller
scope
of
action
limits
proportionally
the
mischief
that
may
ensue
but
even
then
it
is
obviously
desirable
that
his
teaching
should
be
as
good
as
possible
and
he
is
not
likely
to
employ
the
best
methods
if
he
invents
as
he
goes
along
or
simply
falls
back
on
his
remembrance
of
how
he
was
taught
himself
perhaps
in
very
different
circumstances
i
venture
to
think
therefore
that
practical
men
in
education
as
in
most
other
things
may
derive
benefit
from
the
knowledge
of
what
has
already
been
said
and
done
by
the
leading
men
engaged
in
it
both
past
and
present
all
study
of
this
kind
however
is
very
much
impeded
by
want
of
books
books
are
in
german
says
professor
seeley
i
have
found
that
on
the
history
of
education
not
only
books
but
books
are
in
german
or
some
other
foreign
language
i
have
therefore
thought
it
worth
while
to
publish
a
few
such
imperfect
sketches
as
these
with
which
the
reader
can
hardly
be
less
satisfied
than
the
author
they
may
however
prove
useful
till
they
give
place
to
a
better
book
several
of
the
following
essays
are
nothing
more
than
compilations
indeed
a
hostile
critic
might
assert
that
i
had
used
the
scissors
with
the
energy
of
timbs
and
without
his
discretion
the
reader
however
will
probably
agree
with
me
that
i
have
done
wisely
in
putting
before
him
the
opinions
of
great
writers
in
their
own
language
where
i
am
simply
acting
as
reporter
the
own
way
of
expressing
himself
is
obviously
the
best
and
if
following
the
example
of
the
gipsies
and
sir
fretful
plagiary
i
had
disfigured
other
offspring
to
make
them
pass
for
my
own
success
would
have
been
fatal
to
the
purpose
i
have
steadily
kept
in
view
the
sources
of
original
ideas
in
any
subject
as
the
student
is
well
aware
are
few
but
for
irrigation
we
require
troughs
as
well
as
and
these
essays
are
intended
to
serve
in
the
humbler
capacity
a
word
about
the
incomplete
handling
of
my
subjects
i
have
not
attempted
to
treat
any
subject
completely
or
even
with
anything
like
completeness
in
giving
a
sketch
of
the
opinions
of
an
author
one
of
two
methods
must
be
adopted
we
may
give
an
epitome
of
all
that
he
has
said
or
by
confining
ourselves
to
his
more
valuable
and
characteristic
opinions
may
gain
space
to
give
these
fully
as
i
detest
epitomes
i
have
adopted
the
latter
method
exclusively
but
i
may
sometimes
have
failed
in
selecting
an
most
characteristic
principles
and
probably
no
two
readers
of
a
book
would
entirely
agree
as
to
what
was
most
valuable
in
it
so
my
account
must
remain
after
all
but
a
poor
substitute
for
the
author
himself
for
the
part
of
a
critic
i
have
at
least
one
acquaintance
with
the
subject
as
boy
or
master
i
have
been
connected
with
no
less
than
eleven
schools
and
my
perception
of
the
blunders
of
other
teachers
is
derived
mainly
from
the
remembrance
of
my
own
some
of
my
mistakes
have
been
brought
home
to
me
by
reading
works
on
education
even
those
with
which
i
do
not
in
the
main
agree
perhaps
there
are
teachers
who
on
looking
through
the
following
pages
may
meet
with
a
similar
experience
had
the
essays
been
written
in
the
order
in
which
they
stand
a
good
deal
of
repetition
might
have
been
avoided
but
this
repetition
has
at
least
the
advantage
of
bringing
out
points
which
seem
to
me
important
and
as
no
one
will
read
the
book
as
carefully
as
i
have
done
i
hope
no
one
will
be
so
much
alive
to
this
and
other
blemishes
in
it
i
much
regret
that
in
a
work
which
is
nothing
if
it
is
not
practically
useful
i
have
so
often
neglected
to
mark
the
exact
place
from
which
quotations
are
taken
i
have
myself
paid
the
penalty
of
this
carelessness
in
the
trouble
it
has
cost
me
to
verify
passages
which
seemed
inaccurate
the
authority
i
have
had
recourse
to
most
frequently
is
raumer
der
in
his
first
two
volumes
he
gives
an
account
of
the
chief
men
connected
with
education
from
dante
to
pestalozzi
the
third
volume
contains
essays
on
various
parts
of
education
and
the
fourth
is
devoted
to
german
universities
there
is
an
english
translation
published
in
america
of
the
fourth
volume
only
i
confess
to
a
great
partiality
for
partiality
which
is
not
shared
by
a
saturday
reviewer
and
by
other
competent
authorities
in
this
country
but
surely
a
german
author
who
is
not
profound
and
is
almost
perspicuous
has
some
claim
on
the
gratitude
of
english
readers
if
he
gives
information
which
we
can
not
get
in
our
own
language
to
raumer
i
am
indebted
for
all
that
i
have
written
about
ratke
and
almost
all
about
basedow
elsewhere
his
history
has
been
used
though
not
to
the
same
extent
des
is
a
vast
mine
of
information
on
everything
connected
with
education
the
work
is
still
in
progress
the
part
containing
has
only
just
reached
me
i
should
have
been
glad
of
it
when
i
was
giving
an
account
of
the
emile
as
raumer
was
of
little
use
to
me
those
for
whom
schmid
is
too
diffuse
and
expensive
will
find
carl
gottlob
useful
this
is
in
two
thick
volumes
and
costs
to
the
best
of
my
memory
about
eighteen
shillings
it
was
finished
in
the
best
sketch
i
have
met
with
of
the
general
history
of
education
is
in
the
article
on
in
i
wish
someone
would
translate
this
article
and
i
should
be
glad
to
draw
the
attention
of
the
editor
of
an
educational
periodical
say
the
or
the
journal
of
to
it
i
have
come
upon
references
to
many
other
works
on
the
history
of
education
but
of
these
the
only
ones
i
have
seen
are
theodore
système
complet
et
et
de
leur
strasburg
and
carl
der
the
first
of
these
gives
only
the
outline
of
the
subject
the
second
is
i
believe
considered
a
standard
work
it
does
not
seem
to
me
so
readable
as
history
but
it
is
much
more
complete
and
comes
down
to
quite
recent
times
for
my
account
of
the
jesuit
schools
and
of
pestalozzi
the
authorities
will
be
found
elsewhere
pp
and
in
writing
about
comenius
i
have
had
much
assistance
from
a
life
of
him
prefixed
to
an
english
translation
of
his
of
by
daniel
benham
london
for
almost
all
the
information
given
about
jacotot
i
am
indebted
to
papers
which
i
should
not
have
ventured
to
extract
from
so
freely
if
they
had
been
before
the
public
in
a
more
permanent
form
i
am
sorry
i
can
not
refer
to
any
english
works
on
the
history
of
education
except
the
essays
of
parker
and
furnivall
and
schools
and
which
are
mentioned
above
but
we
have
a
very
good
treatise
on
the
principles
of
education
in
as
a
means
of
mental
london
seems
falling
into
undeserved
neglect
and
recent
work
is
not
universally
known
even
by
schoolmasters
if
the
following
pages
attract
but
few
readers
it
will
be
some
consolation
though
rather
a
melancholy
one
that
i
share
the
fate
of
my
betters
ingatestone
essex
preface
to
edition
of
when
i
was
a
young
man
nearly
forty
years
ago
i
once
did
what
those
who
know
the
ground
would
declare
a
very
risky
indeed
a
thing
i
was
at
the
highest
point
of
the
gemmi
pass
in
switzerland
above
the
rhone
valley
and
being
in
a
hurry
to
get
down
and
overtake
my
party
i
ran
from
the
top
to
the
bottom
the
path
in
those
days
was
not
so
good
as
it
is
now
and
it
is
so
near
the
precipice
that
a
few
years
afterwards
a
lady
in
descending
lost
her
head
and
fell
over
no
doubt
i
was
in
great
danger
of
a
drop
of
a
thousand
feet
or
so
but
of
this
i
was
totally
unconscious
i
was
in
a
thick
mist
and
saw
the
path
for
a
few
yards
in
front
of
me
nothing
when
i
think
of
the
way
in
which
this
book
was
written
three
and
twenty
years
ago
i
can
compare
it
to
nothing
but
my
first
descent
of
the
gemmi
i
did
a
very
risky
thing
without
knowing
it
my
path
came
into
view
little
by
little
as
i
went
on
all
else
was
hid
from
me
by
a
thick
mist
of
ignorance
when
i
began
the
book
i
knew
next
to
nothing
of
the
reformers
but
i
studied
hard
and
wrote
hard
and
i
turned
out
the
essays
within
the
year
this
feat
i
now
regard
with
amazement
almost
with
horror
since
that
time
i
have
given
more
years
of
work
to
the
subject
than
i
had
then
given
months
and
the
consequence
is
i
find
i
can
write
fast
no
longer
the
mist
has
in
a
measure
cleared
off
and
i
can
not
jog
along
in
comfort
as
i
did
when
i
saw
less
at
the
same
time
i
have
no
reason
to
repent
of
the
adventure
being
fortunate
in
my
plan
and
thoroughly
interested
by
my
subject
i
succeeded
beyond
my
wildest
expectations
in
getting
others
to
take
an
interest
in
it
also
the
small
english
edition
of
copies
was
as
soon
as
i
reduced
the
price
sold
off
immediately
and
the
book
has
been
in
england
for
twenty
years
of
but
no
less
than
three
publishing
firms
in
the
united
states
have
reprinted
it
one
quite
recently
without
my
consent
and
except
in
the
edition
of
clarke
cincinnati
with
omissions
and
additions
made
without
my
knowledge
it
seems
then
that
the
book
will
live
for
some
years
yet
whether
i
like
it
or
not
and
while
it
lives
i
wish
it
to
be
in
a
form
somewhat
less
defective
than
at
its
first
appearance
i
have
therefore
in
a
great
measure
it
beside
filling
in
a
gap
here
and
there
with
an
additional
essay
perhaps
some
critics
will
call
it
a
new
book
with
an
old
title
if
they
do
they
will
i
trust
allow
that
the
new
book
has
at
least
two
merits
which
went
far
to
secure
the
success
of
the
old
a
good
title
and
a
good
plan
my
plan
in
both
editions
has
been
to
select
a
few
people
who
seemed
specially
worth
knowing
about
and
to
tell
concerning
them
in
some
detail
just
that
which
seemed
to
me
specially
worth
knowing
so
i
have
given
what
i
thought
very
valuable
or
very
interesting
and
everything
i
thought
not
particularly
valuable
or
interesting
i
have
ruthlessly
omitted
i
have
not
attempted
a
account
of
anybody
or
anything
and
as
for
what
the
examiner
may
i
have
not
once
given
his
questions
a
thought
as
the
book
is
likely
to
have
more
readers
in
the
country
of
its
adoption
than
in
the
country
of
its
birth
i
have
persuaded
my
friend
william
harris
the
united
states
commissioner
of
education
to
put
it
into
international
education
which
he
edits
so
the
only
authorized
editions
of
the
book
are

the

of

much
as
it
has
been
hitherto
neglected
especially
in
england
must
have
a
great
future
before
it
if
we
ignore
the
past
we
can
not
understand
the
present
or
forecast
the
future
in
this
book
i
am
going
to
speak
of
reformers
or
innovators
who
aimed
at
changing
what
was
handed
down
to
them
but
the
radical
can
no
more
escape
from
the
past
than
the
conservative
can
stereotype
it
it
acts
not
by
attraction
only
but
no
less
by
repulsion
there
have
been
thinkers
in
latter
times
who
have
announced
themselves
as
the
executioners
of
the
past
and
laboured
to
destroy
all
it
has
bequeathed
to
us
they
have
raised
the
ferocious
cry
la
destruction
vive
la
mort
place
à
hurrah
for
destruction
hurrah
for
death
make
room
for
the
world
that
is
to
be
but
their
very
hatred
of
the
past
has
brought
them
under
the
influence
of
it
just
the
opposite
of
what
has
been
done
and
you
will
do
right
said
rousseau
and
this
rule
of
negation
would
make
the
past
regulate
the
present
and
the
future
no
less
than
its
opposite
always
what
is
if
we
can
not
get
free
from
the
past
in
the
domain
of
thought
still
less
can
we
in
action
custom
is
to
all
our
activities
what
the
mainspring
is
to
the
watch
we
may
bring
forces
into
play
to
make
the
watch
go
faster
or
slower
but
if
we
took
out
the
mainspring
it
would
not
go
at
all
for
mainspring
we
are
indebted
to
the
past
in
studying
the
past
we
must
give
our
special
attention
to
those
periods
in
which
the
course
of
ideas
takes
as
the
french
say
a
new
bend
such
a
period
was
the
renascence
then
it
was
that
the
latest
bend
was
given
to
the
educational
ideal
of
the
civilized
world
and
though
we
seem
now
again
to
have
arrived
at
a
period
of
change
we
are
still
perhaps
far
more
than
we
are
aware
affected
by
the
ideas
of
the
great
scholars
who
guided
the
intellect
of
europe
in
the
revival
of
learning
from
the
beginning
to
the
end
of
the
fifteenth
century
the
balance
was
trembling
between
two
kinds
of
culture
and
the
fate
of
the
schoolboy
depended
on
the
result
in
this
century
men
first
got
a
correct
conception
of
the
globe
they
were
inhabiting
hitherto
they
had
not
even
professed
to
have
any
knowledge
of
geography
there
is
no
mention
of
it
in
the
trivium
and
quadrivium
which
were
then
supposed
to
form
the
cycle
of
things
known
if
not
of
things
knowable
but
columbus
and
vasco
da
gama
were
grand
teachers
of
geography
and
their
lessons
were
learnt
as
far
as
civilization
extended
the
impetus
thus
given
to
the
study
of
the
earth
might
at
the
beginning
of
the
sixteenth
century
have
engrossed
the
mind
of
europe
with
the
material
world
had
not
the
leaning
to
physical
science
been
encountered
and
overcome
by
an
impulse
derived
from
another
discovery
about
the
time
of
the
discovery
of
america
there
also
came
to
light
the
literatures
of
greece
and
rome
when
i
speak
of
the
discovery
of
the
ancient
literatures
as
rivalling
that
of
america
this
use
of
the
word
may
be
disputed
it
may
be
urged
that
though
the
greek
language
and
literature
were
unknown
in
the
west
of
europe
till
they
were
brought
there
by
the
fugitives
after
the
fall
of
constantinople
in
yet
the
works
of
the
great
latin
writers
had
always
been
known
in
italy
and
dante
declares
himself
the
disciple
of
virgil
and
yet
i
can
not
give
up
the
word
in
the
life
of
an
individual
it
sometimes
happens
that
he
suddenly
acquires
as
it
were
a
new
sense
the
world
around
him
remains
the
same
as
before
but
it
is
not
the
same
to
him
a
film
passes
from
his
eyes
and
what
has
been
ordinary
and
unmeaning
suddenly
becomes
a
source
of
wonder
and
delight
to
him
something
similar
happens
at
times
in
the
history
of
the
general
mind
indeed
our
own
century
has
seen
a
remarkable
instance
of
it
in
reading
the
thoughts
of
great
writers
of
earlier
times
we
can
not
but
be
struck
not
only
with
their
ignorance
of
the
material
world
but
also
with
their
ignorance
of
their
ignorance
little
as
they
know
they
often
speak
as
if
they
knew
everything
newton
could
see
that
he
was
like
a
child
discovering
a
few
shells
while
the
unexplored
ocean
lay
before
him
but
in
those
days
it
required
the
intellect
of
a
newton
to
understand
this
to
the
other
children
the
ocean
seemed
to
conceal
nothing
and
they
innocently
thought
that
all
the
shells
or
nearly
all
had
been
picked
up
it
was
reserved
for
the
people
of
our
own
century
to
become
aware
of
the
marvels
which
lie
around
us
in
the
material
world
and
to
be
fascinated
by
the
discovery
if
the
human
race
could
live
through
several
civilizations
without
opening
its
eyes
to
the
wonders
of
the
earth
it
inhabits
and
then
could
suddenly
become
aware
of
them
we
may
well
understand
its
retaining
unheeded
the
literatures
of
greece
and
rome
for
centuries
and
at
length
as
it
were
discovering
them
and
turning
to
them
with
unbounded
enthusiasm
and
delight
as
students
of
education
we
can
hardly
attach
too
much
importance
to
this
great
revolution
for
nearly
three
centuries
the
curriculum
in
the
public
schools
of
europe
remained
what
the
renascence
had
made
it
we
have
again
entered
on
an
age
of
change
but
we
are
still
much
influenced
by
the
ideas
of
the
renascence
and
the
best
way
to
understand
the
forces
now
at
work
is
to
trace
them
where
possible
to
their
origin
let
us
then
consider
what
the
renascence
was
and
how
it
affected
the
educational
system
in
endeavouring
to
understand
the
renascence
we
can
not
do
better
than
listen
to
what
mark
pattison
says
of
it
in
his
of
the
fifteenth
century
was
revealed
to
a
world
which
had
hitherto
been
trained
to
logical
analysis
the
beauty
of
literary
form
the
conception
of
style
or
finished
expression
had
died
out
with
the
pagan
schools
of
rhetoric
it
was
not
the
despotic
act
of
justinian
in
closing
the
schools
of
athens
which
had
suppressed
it
the
sense
of
art
in
language
decayed
from
the
same
general
causes
which
had
been
fatal
to
all
artistic
perception
banished
from
the
roman
empire
in
the
sixth
century
or
earlier
the
classical
conception
of
beauty
of
form
the
circle
of
ideas
after
near
a
thousand
years
of
oblivion
and
abeyance
cicero
and
virgil
livius
and
ovid
had
been
there
all
along
but
the
idea
of
composite
harmony
on
which
their
works
were
constructed
was
wanting
the
restored
conception
as
if
to
recoup
itself
for
its
long
suppression
took
entire
possession
of
the
mind
of
europe
the
first
period
of
the
renascence
passed
in
adoration
of
the
awakened
beauty
and
in
efforts
to
copy
and
multiply
here
mark
pattison
speaks
as
if
the
conception
of
beauty
of
form
belonged
exclusively
to
the
ancients
and
those
who
learnt
of
them
this
seems
to
require
some
abatement
there
are
points
in
which
mediæval
art
far
excelled
the
art
of
the
renascence
the
thirteenth
century
as
archbishop
trench
has
said
was
in
glorious
creations
of
almost
every
kind
and
in
that
century
our
great
english
architect
street
found
the
root
of
all
that
is
best
in
modern
art
see
afternoon
lectures
but
there
are
expressions
of
beauty
to
which
the
greeks
and
those
who
caught
their
spirit
were
keenly
alive
and
to
which
the
people
of
the
middle
age
seem
to
have
been
blind
the
first
is
beauty
in
the
human
form
the
second
is
beauty
in
literature
the
old
delight
in
beauty
in
the
human
form
has
never
come
back
to
us
ruskin
tells
us
we
are
an
ugly
race
with
limbs
and
well
pleased
with
our
ugliness
and
deformity
and
in
reply
we
only
mutter
something
about
the
necessity
of
clothing
both
for
warmth
and
decency
but
as
to
the
other
expression
of
beauty
beauty
in
literature
the
mind
of
europe
again
became
conscious
of
it
in
the
fifteenth
and
sixteenth
centuries
the
of
this
sense
of
beauty
we
call
the
renascence
before
we
consider
the
effect
of
this
intellectual
revolution
on
education
let
us
be
sure
that
we
are
not
ourselves
with
words
and
that
we
know
exactly
what
we
mean
by
when
the
conceptions
of
an
individual
mind
are
expressed
in
a
permanent
form
of
words
we
get
literature
the
sum
total
of
all
the
permanent
forms
of
expression
in
one
language
make
up
the
literature
of
that
language
and
if
no
one
has
given
his
conceptions
a
form
which
has
been
preserved
the
language
is
without
a
literature
there
are
then
two
things
essential
to
a
literary
work
first
the
conceptions
of
an
individual
mind
second
a
permanent
form
of
expression
hence
it
follows
that
the
domain
of
literature
is
distinct
from
the
domain
of
natural
or
mathematical
science
science
does
not
give
us
the
conceptions
of
an
individual
mind
but
it
tells
us
what
every
rational
person
who
studies
the
subject
must
think
and
science
is
entirely
independent
of
any
form
of
words
a
proposition
of
euclid
is
science
a
sonnet
of
is
literature
we
learn
from
euclid
certain
truths
which
we
should
have
learnt
from
some
one
else
if
euclid
had
never
existed
and
the
propositions
may
be
conveyed
equally
well
in
different
forms
of
words
and
in
any
language
but
a
sonnet
of
conveys
thought
and
feeling
peculiar
to
the
poet
and
even
if
the
same
thought
and
feeling
were
conveyed
to
us
in
other
words
we
should
lose
at
least
half
of
what
he
has
given
us
poetry
is
indeed
only
one
kind
of
literature
but
it
is
the
highest
kind
and
what
is
true
of
literary
works
in
verse
is
true
also
in
a
measure
of
literary
works
in
prose
so
great
is
the
difference
between
science
and
literature
that
in
literature
as
the
first
lord
lytton
said
the
best
books
are
generally
the
oldest
in
science
they
are
the
newest
at
present
we
are
concerned
with
literature
only
there
are
two
ways
in
which
a
work
of
literature
may
excite
our
admiration
and
affect
our
minds
these
are
first
by
the
beauty
of
the
conceptions
it
conveys
to
us
and
second
by
the
beauty
of
the
language
in
which
it
conveys
them
in
the
greatest
works
the
two
excellences
will
be
combined
now
the
literary
taste
proper
fastens
especially
on
the
second
of
the
two
on
beauty
of
expression
and
the
renascence
was
the
revival
of
literary
taste
was
as
mark
pattison
says
conception
of
style
or
finished
expression
which
had
died
out
with
the
pagan
schools
of
rhetoric
and
which
the
circle
of
ideas
after
a
thousand
years
of
oblivion
and
if
we
lose
sight
of
this
we
shall
be
perplexed
by
the
unbounded
enthusiasm
which
we
find
in
the
sixteenth
century
for
the
old
classics
what
great
evangel
we
may
ask
had
cicero
and
virgil
and
ovid
or
even
plato
and
the
greek
dramatists
for
men
who
lived
when
europe
had
experienced
a
thousand
years
of
christianity
the
answer
is
simple
they
had
none
whatever
their
thoughts
and
conceptions
were
not
adapted
to
the
wants
of
the
new
world
the
civilization
of
the
christian
nations
of
the
sixteenth
century
was
a
very
different
thing
from
the
civilization
of
greece
and
rome
it
had
its
own
thoughts
its
own
problems
its
own
wants
the
thoughts
could
not
be
thought
over
again
by
it
this
indeed
was
felt
though
not
admitted
by
the
renascence
scholars
themselves
had
it
been
the
thoughts
of
the
ancients
which
seemed
to
them
so
valuable
they
would
have
made
some
effort
to
diffuse
those
thoughts
in
the
languages
of
the
modern
world
much
as
a
great
literary
work
loses
by
translation
there
may
still
be
enough
left
of
it
to
be
a
source
of
instruction
and
delight
the
thoughts
of
aristotle
conveyed
in
a
latin
translation
of
an
arabic
translation
profoundly
affected
the
mind
of
europe
in
the
middle
ages
the
bible
or
book
is
known
to
few
indeed
in
its
original
form
some
great
and
shakespeare
and
the
author
of
the
and
instruct
nations
who
know
not
the
sound
of
the
languages
wherein
their
works
are
composed
if
then
the
great
writers
of
greece
and
rome
had
been
valued
for
their
matter
their
works
would
have
been
translated
by
the
renascence
scholars
as
the
bible
was
translated
by
the
reformers
and
the
history
of
modern
education
would
have
taken
a
very
different
turn
from
that
which
awaited
it
but
it
was
not
so
the
renascence
scholars
did
all
they
could
to
discourage
translations
for
the
grand
discovery
which
we
call
the
revival
of
learning
was
not
that
the
ancients
had
something
to
say
but
that
whatever
they
had
to
say
they
knew
how
to
say
it
and
thus
it
happens
that
in
the
period
of
change
when
europe
was
its
institutions
developing
new
ideas
and
settling
into
new
grooves
of
habit
we
find
the
men
most
influential
in
education
entirely
fascinated
by
beauty
of
expression
and
this
in
two
ancient
languages
so
that
the
one
thing
needful
for
the
young
seemed
to
them
an
introduction
to
the
study
of
ancient
writings
the
inevitable
consequence
was
this
education
became
a
mere
synonym
for
instruction
in
latin
and
greek
the
only
ideal
set
up
for
the
was
the
classical
scholar
perhaps
the
absurdity
of
taking
this
ideal
an
ideal
which
is
obviously
fitted
for
a
small
class
of
men
only
and
proposing
it
for
general
adoption
was
partly
concealed
from
the
renascence
scholars
by
the
peculiar
circumstances
of
their
age
no
doubt
they
thought
literature
would
in
the
future
be
a
force
capable
of
much
wider
application
than
it
had
ever
been
before
true
literature
had
till
then
affected
a
small
class
only
literature
meant
books
books
meant
and
mss
were
rare
and
costly
literature
the
embodiment
of
grand
thoughts
in
grand
words
had
existed
before
letters
or
at
least
without
letters
the
homeric
poems
for
example
had
been
known
to
thousands
who
could
not
read
or
write
but
beauty
of
expression
naturally
got
associated
and
indeed
confounded
with
the
art
by
which
it
was
preserved
so
the
creations
of
the
mind
when
embodied
in
particular
combinations
of
words
acquired
the
name
of
literature
or
letters
and
became
almost
exclusively
the
affair
of
those
who
had
opportunities
of
study
opportunities
afforded
only
to
the
few
during
the
middle
ages
every
one
who
could
read
was
allowed
his
of
clergy
that
is
he
was
assumed
to
be
a
clergyman
literature
then
was
not
thought
of
as
a
means
of
instruction
but
at
the
very
time
that
the
beauty
of
the
ancient
writings
dawned
on
the
mind
of
europe
a
mechanical
invention
seemed
to
remove
all
hindrances
to
the
spread
of
literature
the
scholars
seized
on
the
printing
press
and
thought
by
means
of
it
to
give
all
a
knowledge
of
classics
we
can
not
help
speculating
what
would
have
been
the
effect
of
the
discovery
of
printing
if
it
had
been
made
at
another
time
as
there
may
be
literature
without
books
so
there
may
be
books
without
literature
if
at
the
time
of
the
invention
of
printing
there
had
been
no
literature
no
creations
of
individual
minds
embodied
in
permanent
forms
of
speech
books
might
have
been
used
as
apparatus
in
a
mental
gymnasium
or
they
might
have
been
made
the
means
of
conveying
information
but
just
then
the
intellect
of
europe
was
tired
of
mental
gymnastics
it
had
taken
exercise
in
the
trivium
like
a
squirrel
in
its
revolving
cage
and
was
vexed
to
find
it
made
no
progress
as
for
information
there
was
little
to
be
had
the
age
of
observation
and
of
physical
science
was
not
yet
so
the
printing
press
was
entirely
at
the
service
of
the
new
passion
for
literature
and
the
scholars
dreamed
of
the
general
diffusion
of
literary
culture
by
means
of
printed
books
for
some
two
centuries
the
literary
spirit
had
supreme
control
over
the
intellect
of
europe
and
the
literary
spirit
could
then
find
satisfaction
nowhere
but
in
the
study
of
the
ancient
classics
the
natural
consequence
was
that
throughout
this
period
the
was
supposed
to
be
identified
with
the
classical
scholar
the
great
rival
of
the
literary
spirit
the
scientific
spirit
which
cares
for
nothing
but
sequences
independent
of
the
human
mind
began
to
show
itself
early
in
the
seventeenth
century
its
first
great
champion
was
francis
bacon
but
by
this
time
the
school
course
of
study
had
been
settled
and
two
centuries
had
to
elapse
before
the
scientific
spirit
could
unsettle
it
again
even
now
when
we
speak
of
a
man
as
we
are
commonly
understood
to
mean
that
in
his
youth
he
was
taught
the
two
classical
languages
the
taking
of
the
classical
scholar
as
the
only
ideal
of
the
educated
man
has
been
a
fruitful
source
of
evil
in
the
history
of
education
i
this
ideal
exalted
the
learner
above
the
doer
as
far
back
as
xenophon
we
find
a
contest
between
the
passive
ideal
and
the
active
between
the
excellence
which
depends
on
a
knowledge
of
what
others
have
thought
and
done
and
the
excellence
which
comes
of
thinking
and
doing
but
the
excellence
derived
from
learning
had
never
been
highly
esteemed
to
be
able
to
repeat
poetry
was
regarded
in
greece
as
we
now
regard
a
pleasing
accomplishment
but
the
dignity
of
the
learned
man
as
such
was
not
within
the
range
of
greek
ideas
many
of
the
romans
after
they
began
to
study
greek
literature
certainly
piqued
themselves
on
being
good
greek
scholars
and
cicero
occasionally
quotes
with
all
the
airs
of
a
pedant
but
so
thoroughly
was
the
contrary
ideal
the
ideal
of
the
established
at
rome
that
nobody
ever
dreamt
of
placing
its
rival
above
it
in
the
decline
of
the
empire
especially
at
alexandria
we
find
for
the
first
time
honours
paid
to
the
learned
man
but
he
was
soon
lost
sight
of
again
at
the
renascence
he
burst
into
sudden
blaze
and
it
was
then
discovered
that
he
was
what
every
man
would
wish
to
be
thus
the
renascence
scholars
notwithstanding
their
admiration
of
the
great
nations
of
antiquity
set
up
an
ideal
which
those
nations
would
heartily
have
despised
the
schoolmaster
very
readily
adopted
this
ideal
and
schools
have
been
places
of
learning
not
training
ever
since
ii
the
next
defect
i
observe
in
the
renascence
ideal
is
this
it
attributes
to
literature
more
direct
power
over
common
life
than
literature
has
ever
had
or
is
ever
likely
to
have
i
say
power
for
indirectly
literature
is
one
of
the
grand
forces
which
act
on
all
of
us
but
it
acts
on
us
through
others
its
most
important
function
being
to
affect
great
intellects
the
minds
of
those
who
think
out
and
act
out
important
changes
its
direct
action
on
the
mass
of
mankind
is
after
all
but
insignificant
we
have
seen
that
literature
consists
in
permanent
forms
of
words
expressing
the
conceptions
of
individual
minds
and
these
forms
will
be
studied
only
by
those
who
are
interested
in
the
conceptions
or
find
pleasure
in
the
mode
in
which
they
are
expressed
now
the
vast
majority
of
ordinary
people
are
without
these
inducements
to
literary
study
they
take
a
keen
interest
in
everything
connected
with
their
relations
and
intimate
friends
and
a
weaker
interest
in
the
thinkings
and
sayings
and
doings
of
every
one
else
who
is
personally
known
to
them
but
as
to
the
mental
conceptions
of
those
who
lived
in
other
times
or
if
now
alive
are
not
known
even
by
sight
the
ordinary
person
is
profoundly
indifferent
to
them
and
of
course
delight
in
expression
as
such
is
out
of
the
question
the
natural
consequence
is
that
the
habit
of
reading
books
is
by
no
means
common
mark
pattison
observes
that
there
are
few
books
to
be
found
in
most
english
homes
and
he
says
dearth
of
books
is
only
the
outward
and
visible
sign
of
the
mental
torpor
which
reigns
in
those
destitute
see
review
november
i
much
doubt
if
he
would
have
found
more
books
in
the
homes
of
the
continent
there
is
only
one
kind
of
reading
that
is
nearly
reading
of
newspapers
and
the
newspaper
lacks
the
element
of
permanence
and
belongs
to
the
domain
of
talk
rather
than
of
literature
even
when
we
get
among
the
we
find
that
those
who
care
for
literature
form
a
very
small
minority
the
rest
of
course
read
shakespeare
and
milton
and
walter
scott
and
tennyson
but
do
not
read
the
share
of
our
time
and
thoughts
and
interests
must
be
given
to
our
business
or
profession
whatever
that
may
be
and
in
few
instances
is
this
connected
with
literature
for
the
rest
whatever
time
or
thought
a
man
can
spare
from
his
calling
is
mostly
given
to
his
family
or
to
society
or
to
some
hobby
which
is
not
literature
and
love
of
literature
is
not
shown
in
such
reading
as
is
common
the
literary
spirit
shows
itself
as
i
said
in
appreciating
beauty
of
expression
and
how
far
beauty
of
expression
is
cared
for
we
may
estimate
from
the
fact
that
few
people
think
of
reading
anything
a
second
time
the
ordinary
reader
is
profoundly
indifferent
about
style
and
will
not
take
the
trouble
to
understand
ideas
he
keeps
to
periodicals
or
light
fiction
which
enables
the
mind
to
loll
in
its
easy
chair
so
to
speak
and
see
pass
before
it
a
series
of
pleasing
images
an
idea
as
mark
pattison
says
an
excitant
comes
from
mind
and
calls
forth
mind
an
image
is
a
sedative
and
most
people
when
they
take
up
a
book
are
seeking
a
sedative
so
literature
is
after
all
a
very
small
force
in
the
lives
of
most
men
and
perhaps
even
less
in
the
lives
of
most
women
why
then
are
the
employments
of
the
arranged
on
the
supposition
that
it
is
the
grand
force
of
all
the
reason
is
that
we
have
inherited
from
the
renascence
a
false
notion
of
the
function
of
literature
iii
i
must
now
point
out
a
fault
in
the
renascence
ideal
which
is
perhaps
the
most
remarkable
of
all
those
by
whom
this
ideal
was
set
up
were
entirely
possessed
by
an
enthusiasm
for
literature
and
they
made
the
mistake
of
attributing
to
literature
a
share
in
general
culture
which
literature
seems
incapable
of
taking
after
this
we
could
little
have
expected
that
the
new
ideal
would
exclude
literature
from
the
schoolroom
and
yet
so
it
has
actually
turned
out
as
a
literary
creation
contains
the
conceptions
of
an
individual
mind
expressed
in
a
permanent
form
of
words
it
exists
only
for
those
who
can
understand
the
words
or
at
least
the
conceptions
from
this
it
follows
that
literature
for
the
young
must
have
its
expression
in
the
vernacular
the
instances
are
rare
indeed
in
which
any
one
below
the
age
of
fifteen
or
sixteen
perhaps
i
might
put
the
limit
a
year
or
two
higher
understands
any
but
the
mother
tongue
in
the
mother
tongue
indeed
some
forms
of
literature
exercise
a
great
influence
over
young
minds
ballad
literature
seems
especially
to
belong
to
youth
the
youth
of
nations
and
of
individuals
aristotle
educated
alexander
with
homer
and
we
can
easily
imagine
the
effect
which
the
must
have
had
on
the
young
greeks
although
in
the
days
of
plato
instruction
was
not
confined
to
literature
he
gives
this
account
of
part
of
the
training
in
the
athenian
schools
the
pupils
on
benches
the
instructors
make
them
read
and
learn
by
heart
the
poems
of
good
poets
in
which
are
many
moral
lessons
many
tales
and
eulogies
and
lays
of
the
brave
men
of
old
that
the
boys
may
imitate
them
with
emulation
and
strive
to
become
such
here
we
see
a
very
important
function
attributed
to
literature
in
the
bringing
up
of
the
young
but
the
literature
so
used
must
obviously
be
in
the
language
of
the
learners
the
influence
of
a
literary
work
may
however
extend
itself
far
beyond
the
limits
of
its
own
language
when
our
minds
can
receive
and
take
pleasure
in
the
conceptions
of
a
great
writer
he
may
speak
to
us
by
an
interpreter
at
the
renascence
there
were
books
in
the
world
which
might
have
affected
the
minds
of
the
herodotus
and
above
all
homer
but
as
i
have
already
said
it
was
not
the
conceptions
but
the
literary
form
of
the
ancients
which
seemed
to
the
renascence
scholars
of
such
inestimable
value
so
they
refused
to
give
the
conceptions
in
any
but
the
original
words
the
ancients
in
translations
says
melancthon
merely
looking
at
the
he
could
not
have
made
a
greater
mistake
as
far
as
the
young
are
concerned
the
truth
is
exactly
the
reverse
the
translation
would
give
the
substance
the
original
can
give
nothing
but
the
shadow
let
us
take
the
experience
of
kinglake
the
author
of
this
distinguished
eton
man
fired
by
his
remembrances
of
homer
visited
the
troad
he
had
as
he
tells
us
the
line
by
line
to
his
brain
with
reverence
as
well
as
well
done
eton
we
are
tempted
to
exclaim
when
we
read
this
passage
here
at
least
is
proof
that
some
was
taught
in
those
days
of
the
dominion
of
the
classics
but
stop
it
seems
that
this
clasping
did
not
take
place
at
eton
but
in
happy
days
before
eton
when
kinglake
knew
no
greek
and
read
translations
days
are
these
he
writes
the
dark
ages
of
schoolboy
life
come
closing
over
them
i
suppose
all
right
in
the
end
yet
by
jove
at
first
sight
it
does
seem
a
sad
intellectual
fall
the
dismal
change
is
ordained
and
thin
meagre
latin
the
same
for
everybody
with
small
shreds
and
patches
of
greek
is
thrown
like
a
pall
over
all
your
early
lore
instead
of
sweet
knowledge
vile
monkish
doggrel
grammars
and
graduses
dictionaries
and
lexicons
horrible
odds
and
ends
of
dead
languages
are
given
you
for
your
portion
and
down
you
fall
from
roman
story
to
a
scrap
of
greek
poetry
down
down
to
the
cold
rations
of
græci
cut
up
by
commentators
and
served
out
by
schoolmasters
the
troad
we
see
from
this
how
the
renascence
ideal
had
the
extraordinary
effect
of
banishing
literature
from
the
literature
has
indeed
not
ceased
to
influence
the
young
it
still
counts
for
much
more
in
their
lives
than
in
the
lives
of
their
seniors
but
we
all
know
who
are
the
writers
who
affected
our
own
minds
in
childhood
and
youth
and
who
affect
the
minds
of
our
pupils
eutropius
or
xenophon
or
cæsar
or
cicero
but
defoe
and
swift
and
marryatt
and
walter
scott
the
ancient
writings
which
were
literature
to
melancthon
and
erasmus
as
they
are
still
to
many
in
our
universities
and
elsewhere
can
never
be
literature
to
the
young
most
of
the
classical
authors
read
in
the
schoolroom
could
not
be
made
literature
to
young
people
even
by
means
of
translations
for
they
were
men
who
wrote
for
men
and
women
only
we
see
that
it
would
be
absurd
to
make
an
ordinary
boy
of
twelve
or
fourteen
study
burke
or
pope
and
if
we
do
not
make
him
read
burke
whose
language
he
understands
why
do
we
make
him
read
cicero
whose
language
he
does
not
understand
if
he
can
not
appreciate
pope
why
do
we
teach
him
horace
the
renascence
gives
us
the
explanation
of
this
singular
anomaly
the
scholars
of
that
age
were
so
delighted
with
the
of
the
ancient
classics
that
the
study
of
these
classics
seemed
to
them
the
one
thing
worth
living
for
the
main
if
not
the
only
object
they
kept
in
view
in
bringing
up
the
young
was
to
gain
for
them
admission
to
the
treasure
house
and
though
young
people
could
not
understand
the
ancient
writings
as
literature
they
might
at
least
study
them
as
language
and
thus
be
ready
to
enjoy
them
as
literature
in
thus
the
subject
of
instruction
in
the
schoolroom
came
to
be
not
the
classics
but
the
classical
languages
the
classics
were
used
as
school
books
but
the
only
meaning
thought
of
was
the
meaning
of
the
detached
word
or
at
best
of
the
detached
sentence
you
ask
a
child
learning
to
read
if
he
understands
what
he
is
reading
about
and
he
says
think
of
the
meaning
because
i
am
thinking
of
the
the
same
thing
happened
in
the
study
of
the
classics
and
so
it
has
come
to
pass
that
to
this
day
the
great
writers
of
antiquity
discharge
a
humble
function
which
they
certainly
never
contemplated
body
dead
and
turned
to
clay
may
stop
a
hole
to
keep
the
wind
and
great
mind
has
been
turned
to
uses
almost
as
paltry
he
has
in
fact
written
for
the
schoolroom
not
a
commentary
on
the
wars
of
of
the
simply
a
book
of
exercises
in
latin
construing
and
an
excellent
book
it
would
be
if
he
had
only
graduated
the
difficulties
better
iv
there
is
yet
another
weakness
about
the
renascence
weakness
from
which
most
ideals
are
free
most
ideals
have
this
merit
at
least
that
he
who
makes
even
a
feeble
and
abortive
attempt
to
reach
them
is
benefited
in
proportion
to
his
advance
however
small
that
advance
may
be
if
he
fails
to
seize
the
coat
of
gold
he
carries
away
as
the
proverb
tells
us
at
least
one
of
the
sleeves
or
to
use
george
who
aimeth
at
the
sky
shoots
higher
far
than
he
who
means
a
but
the
learned
ideal
has
not
even
this
advantage
the
first
stage
the
study
of
the
ancient
languages
is
so
totally
different
from
the
study
of
the
ancient
literatures
to
which
it
is
the
preliminary
that
the
student
who
never
goes
beyond
this
first
stage
either
gets
no
benefit
at
all
or
a
benefit
which
is
not
of
the
kind
intended
suppose
i
am
within
a
walk
though
a
long
one
of
the
british
museum
and
hearing
of
some
valuable
books
in
the
library
which
i
can
see
nowhere
else
i
set
off
to
consult
them
in
this
case
it
makes
no
difference
to
me
how
valuable
the
books
are
if
i
do
not
get
as
far
as
the
museum
my
friends
may
comfort
me
with
the
assurance
that
the
walk
must
have
done
me
good
perhaps
so
but
i
left
home
to
get
a
knowledge
of
certain
books
not
to
exercise
my
legs
had
exercise
been
my
object
i
should
probably
have
chosen
another
direction
now
schoolmasters
since
the
renascence
have
been
in
the
habit
of
leading
all
their
pupils
through
the
back
slums
of
the
seven
dials
and
soho
in
the
direction
of
the
british
museum
with
the
avowed
purpose
of
taking
them
to
the
library
although
they
knew
full
well
that
not
one
pupil
in
ten
not
one
in
fifty
would
ever
reach
the
door
to
produce
a
few
scholars
able
to
appreciate
the
classics
of
greece
and
rome
they
have
sacrificed
everybody
else
and
according
to
their
own
showing
they
have
condemned
a
large
portion
of
the
upper
classes
nearly
all
the
middle
classes
and
quite
all
the
poorer
classes
to
remain
and
according
to
the
theory
of
the
schoolroom
of
the
human
not
been
supposed
to
need
education
for
them
have
been
held
sufficient
in
conclusion
i
must
point
out
one
effect
of
the
renascence
ideal
which
seems
to
me
no
less
mischievous
than
those
i
have
already
mentioned
this
ideal
led
the
schoolmasters
to
attach
little
importance
to
the
education
of
directly
their
pupils
were
old
enough
for
latin
grammar
the
schoolmasters
were
quite
at
home
but
till
then
the
time
seemed
to
them
of
small
value
and
they
neither
knew
nor
cared
to
know
how
to
employ
it
if
the
little
ones
could
learn
by
heart
forms
of
words
which
would
afterwards
in
useful
the
schoolmasters
were
ready
to
assist
such
learning
by
unsparing
application
of
the
rod
but
no
other
learning
seemed
worthy
even
of
a
caning
absorbed
in
the
world
of
books
they
overlooked
the
world
of
nature
galileo
complains
that
he
could
not
induce
them
to
look
through
his
telescope
for
they
held
that
truth
could
be
arrived
at
only
by
comparison
of
mss
no
wonder
then
that
they
had
so
little
sympathy
with
children
and
did
not
know
how
to
teach
them
it
is
by
slow
degrees
that
we
are
breaking
away
from
the
bad
tradition
then
established
are
getting
to
understand
children
and
with
such
leaders
as
rousseau
pestalozzi
and
froebel
are
investigating
the
best
education
for
them
we
no
longer
think
of
them
as
immature
men
and
women
but
see
that
each
stage
has
its
own
completeness
and
that
there
is
a
perfection
in
childhood
which
must
precede
the
perfection
of
manhood
just
as
truly
as
the
flower
goes
before
the
fruit
says
rousseau
its
own
ways
of
seeing
feeling
thinking
and
it
is
by
studying
these
that
we
find
out
how
children
should
be
educated
our
connexion
with
the
world
of
nature
seems
much
closer
in
our
early
years
than
ever
afterwards
the
mind
seems
drawn
out
to
its
surroundings
he
is
intensely
interested
in
the
new
world
in
which
he
finds
himself
and
whilst
so
many
of
us
grown
people
need
a
flapper
like
the
sages
of
laputa
to
call
our
attention
from
our
own
thoughts
to
anything
that
meets
the
eye
or
ear
the
child
sees
and
hears
everything
and
everything
seen
or
heard
becomes
associated
in
his
mind
not
so
much
with
thought
as
with
feeling
hence
it
is
that
we
most
of
us
look
back
wistfully
to
our
early
days
and
confess
sorrowfully
that
though
years
may
have
brought
philosophic
mind
nothing
can
bring
back
the
hour
of
splendour
in
the
grass
of
glory
in
the
the
material
world
then
seems
to
supply
just
those
objects
whether
birds
beasts
or
flowers
by
which
the
child
is
attracted
and
on
which
his
faculties
will
therefore
be
most
naturally
and
healthily
employed
but
the
renascence
schoolmasters
had
little
notion
of
this
if
you
think
that
the
greatest
scholar
is
the
greatest
man
you
will
as
a
matter
of
course
place
at
the
other
end
of
the
scale
those
who
are
not
scholars
at
all
an
english
inspector
who
seems
to
have
thought
children
had
been
created
with
due
regard
to
the
revised
code
of
the
privy
council
spoke
of
the
infants
who
could
not
be
classed
by
their
performances
in
three
as
fag
end
of
the
school
and
no
doubt
the
renascence
schoolmasters
considered
the
children
the
fag
end
of
humanity
the
great
scholars
were
indeed
far
above
the
race
of
pedants
but
the
schoolmasters
who
adopted
their
ideal
were
not
and
what
is
a
pedant
man
who
has
got
rid
of
his
brains
to
make
room
for
his
the
pedantic
schoolmasters
of
the
renascence
wished
the
mind
of
the
pupil
to
be
cleared
of
everything
else
that
it
might
have
room
for
the
languages
of
greece
and
rome
but
what
if
the
mind
failed
to
take
in
its
destined
freight
in
that
case
the
schoolmasters
had
nothing
else
for
it
and
were
content
that
it
should
go
empty
ii
renascence
tendencies
in
considering
and
comparing
the
two
great
epochs
of
intellectual
activity
and
change
in
modern
times
the
sixteenth
century
and
the
nineteenth
we
can
not
but
be
struck
with
one
fundamental
difference
between
them
it
will
affect
all
our
thoughts
as
sir
henry
maine
has
said
whether
we
place
the
golden
age
in
the
past
or
in
the
future
in
the
nineteenth
century
the
is
supposed
to
be
but
in
the
sixteenth
century
all
thinkers
looked
backwards
the
great
italian
scholars
gazed
with
admiration
and
envy
on
the
works
of
ancient
greece
and
rome
and
longed
to
restore
the
old
languages
and
as
much
as
possible
the
old
world
so
that
such
works
might
be
produced
again
many
were
suspected
not
altogether
perhaps
without
reason
of
wishing
to
uproot
christianity
itself
that
they
might
bring
back
the
golden
age
of
pericles
at
the
same
time
another
movement
was
going
on
principally
in
germany
here
too
men
were
endeavouring
to
throw
off
the
immediate
past
in
order
to
revive
the
remote
past
the
religious
reformers
like
the
scholars
wished
to
restore
a
golden
age
only
a
different
age
not
the
age
of
the
antigone
but
the
age
of
the
creed
thus
it
happened
that
the
scholars
and
the
reformers
joined
in
attaching
the
very
highest
importance
to
the
ancient
languages
through
these
languages
and
as
they
thought
through
them
alone
was
it
possible
to
get
a
glimpse
into
the
bygone
world
in
which
their
soul
delighted
but
though
all
joined
in
extolling
the
ancient
writings
we
find
at
the
renascence
great
differences
in
the
way
of
regarding
these
writings
and
in
the
objects
for
which
they
were
employed
a
consideration
of
these
differences
will
help
us
to
understand
the
course
of
education
when
the
renascence
was
a
force
no
longer
very
powerful
in
education
were
the
great
scholars
of
whom
erasmus
was
perhaps
the
greatest
certainly
the
most
celebrated
in
devoting
their
lives
to
the
study
of
the
ancients
their
object
was
not
merely
to
appreciate
literary
style
though
this
was
a
source
of
boundless
delight
to
them
but
also
to
the
classical
writings
and
the
ancient
world
through
them
these
men
whom
we
may
call
the
scholars
cared
indeed
before
all
things
for
literature
but
with
all
their
delight
in
the
form
they
never
lost
sight
of
the
substance
they
knew
the
truth
that
milton
afterwards
expressed
in
these
memorable
words
a
linguist
should
pride
himself
to
have
all
the
tongues
that
babel
cleft
the
world
into
yet
if
he
have
not
studied
the
solid
things
in
them
as
well
as
the
words
and
lexicons
he
were
nothing
so
much
to
be
esteemed
a
learned
man
as
any
yeoman
or
tradesman
competently
wise
in
his
mother
dialect
tractate
to
hartlib
so
erasmus
and
the
scholars
would
have
all
the
educated
the
classical
authors
but
to
understand
words
you
must
know
the
things
to
which
the
words
refer
thus
the
scholars
were
led
to
advocate
a
partial
study
of
things
a
kind
of
realism
but
we
must
carefully
observe
a
peculiarity
of
this
scholastic
realism
which
distinguished
it
from
the
realism
of
a
later
realism
of
bacon
the
study
of
things
was
undertaken
not
for
its
own
sake
but
simply
in
order
to
understand
books
perhaps
some
of
us
are
conscious
that
this
kind
of
literary
realism
has
not
wholly
passed
away
we
may
have
observed
wild
flowers
or
the
changes
in
tree
or
cloud
because
we
find
that
the
best
way
to
understand
some
favourite
author
as
wordsworth
or
tennyson
this
will
help
us
to
understand
the
realism
of
the
sixteenth
century
the
writings
of
great
authors
have
been
compared
to
the
plaster
globes
as
we
call
them
which
assist
us
in
understanding
the
configuration
of
the
stars
at
j
adopting
this
simile
we
may
say
that
the
scholars
loved
to
study
the
globe
for
its
own
sake
and
when
they
looked
at
stars
they
did
so
with
the
object
of
understanding
the
globe
thus
we
read
of
doctors
who
recommended
their
pupils
to
look
at
actual
cases
of
disease
as
the
best
commentary
on
the
works
of
hippocrates
and
galen
this
kind
of
realism
was
good
as
far
as
it
went
but
it
did
not
go
far
of
course
the
end
in
view
limited
the
study
and
the
scholars
took
no
interest
in
things
except
those
which
were
mentioned
in
the
classics
they
had
no
desire
to
investigate
the
material
universe
and
make
discoveries
for
themselves
this
is
why
galileo
could
not
induce
them
to
look
through
his
telescope
for
the
ancients
had
no
telescopes
and
the
scholars
wished
to
see
nothing
that
had
not
been
seen
by
their
favourite
authors
first
then
we
have
the
scholars
headed
by
erasmus
next
we
find
a
party
less
numerous
and
for
a
time
less
influential
who
did
care
about
things
for
the
sake
of
the
things
themselves
but
carried
away
by
the
literary
current
of
their
age
they
sought
to
learn
about
them
not
directly
but
only
by
reading
here
again
we
have
a
kind
of
realism
which
is
not
yet
extinct
some
years
ago
i
was
assured
by
a
graduate
of
the
university
of
london
who
had
passed
in
chemistry
that
as
far
as
he
knew
he
had
never
seen
a
chemical
in
his
life
he
had
got
all
his
knowledge
from
books
while
such
a
thing
is
possible
among
us
we
need
not
wonder
if
those
who
in
the
sixteenth
century
prized
the
knowledge
of
things
allowed
books
to
come
between
the
learner
and
the
object
of
his
study
if
they
regarded
nature
as
a
country
of
which
we
could
know
nothing
but
what
great
authors
reported
to
us
as
this
party
unlike
the
scholars
did
not
delight
in
literature
as
such
but
simply
as
a
means
of
acquiring
knowledge
literary
form
was
not
valued
by
them
and
they
preferred
euclid
to
sophocles
columella
to
virgil
seeking
to
learn
about
things
not
immediately
but
through
words
they
have
received
from
raumer
a
name
they
are
likely
to
realists
in
the
sixteenth
century
the
greatest
of
the
verbal
realists
also
gave
a
hint
of
realism
proper
for
he
was
no
less
a
man
than
rabelais
lastly
we
come
to
those
who
as
it
turned
out
were
to
have
more
influence
in
the
schoolroom
than
the
scholars
and
the
verbal
realists
combined
i
do
not
know
that
these
have
had
any
name
given
them
but
for
distinction
sake
we
may
call
them
in
studying
literature
the
scholars
cared
both
for
form
and
substance
the
verbal
realists
for
substance
only
and
the
stylists
for
form
only
the
stylists
gave
up
their
lives
not
like
the
scholars
to
gain
a
thorough
understanding
of
the
ancient
writings
and
of
the
old
world
but
to
an
attempted
reproduction
of
the
ancient
languages
and
of
the
classical
literary
form
in
marking
these
tendencies
at
the
renascence
we
must
remember
that
though
distinguished
by
their
tendencies
these
scholars
verbal
realists
and
stylists
were
not
divided
into
clearly
defined
parties
categories
like
these
no
doubt
assist
us
in
gaining
precision
of
thought
but
we
must
not
gain
precision
at
the
expense
of
accuracy
the
tendencies
we
have
been
considering
did
not
act
in
precisely
opposite
directions
and
all
were
to
some
extent
affected
by
them
but
one
tendency
was
predominant
in
one
man
and
another
in
another
and
this
justifies
us
in
calling
sturm
a
stylist
erasmus
a
scholar
and
rabelais
a
verbal
realist
in
one
respect
they
were
all
agreed
the
world
was
to
be
regenerated
by
means
of
books
nothing
pleased
them
more
than
to
think
of
their
age
as
the
revival
of
learning
iii
sturmius
the
curriculum
bequeathed
by
the
renascence
and
stereotyped
in
the
school
codes
of
germany
in
the
of
the
jesuits
and
in
the
english
public
school
system
was
greatly
influenced
by
the
most
famous
schoolmaster
of
the
fifteen
hundreds
john
sturm
who
was
for
over
forty
years
rector
of
the
strassburg
gymnasium
sturm
was
a
fine
specimen
of
the
successful
man
he
knew
what
his
contemporaries
wanted
and
that
was
just
what
he
wanted
was
a
blessed
fellow
as
prince
hal
says
of
poins
think
as
every
man
thought
and
he
not
only
the
himself
but
he
also
great
bands
of
pupils
over
it
at
one
time
noblemen
counts
and
barons
and
what
could
schoolmaster
desire
more
but
i
frankly
own
that
sturm
is
no
favourite
of
mine
and
that
i
think
that
he
did
much
harm
to
education
however
his
influence
in
the
schoolroom
was
so
great
that
i
must
not
leave
him
unnoticed
and
i
give
some
information
taken
mainly
from
account
of
him
which
is
translated
in
henry
teachers
and
i
have
also
looked
at
the
exhaustive
article
by
bossier
in
john
sturm
born
at
schleiden
in
the
eifel
not
far
from
cologne
in
was
one
of
children
and
would
not
have
had
much
teaching
had
not
his
father
been
steward
to
a
nobleman
with
whose
sons
he
was
brought
up
he
always
spoke
with
reverence
and
affection
of
his
early
teachers
and
from
them
no
doubt
he
acquired
his
thirst
for
learning
with
the
sons
and
under
the
guidance
of
a
tutor
he
was
sent
to
liège
and
there
he
attended
a
school
of
the
of
the
life
in
common
hieronymites
many
of
the
arrangements
of
this
school
he
afterwards
reproduced
in
the
strassburg
gymnasium
and
in
this
way
the
good
brethren
gained
an
influence
over
classical
education
throughout
the
world
between
the
age
of
and
sturm
was
at
lyons
and
before
the
end
of
this
period
he
was
forced
into
teaching
for
a
maintenance
he
then
like
many
other
learned
men
of
the
time
turned
printer
we
next
find
him
at
the
university
of
paris
where
he
thought
of
becoming
a
doctor
of
medicine
but
was
finally
carried
away
from
natural
science
by
the
renascence
devotion
to
literature
and
he
became
a
popular
lecturer
on
the
classics
from
paris
he
was
called
to
strassburg
then
as
now
in
germany
in
in
he
published
his
plan
of
a
gymnasium
or
grammar
school
with
the
title
right
way
of
opening
schools
of
literature
literarum
ludis
recte
and
some
years
afterwards
he
published
his
letters
to
the
different
in
his
school
the
object
of
teaching
is
says
sturm
knowledge
and
the
art
of
the
student
should
be
distinguished
by
reasonable
and
neat
speech
et
to
attain
this
the
boys
in
his
school
had
to
give
seven
years
to
the
acquirement
of
a
pure
latin
style
then
two
years
more
were
devoted
to
elegance
then
five
years
of
collegiate
life
were
to
be
given
to
the
art
of
latin
speech
this
course
is
for
ten
years
carefully
mapped
out
by
sturm
in
his
letters
to
the
masters
the
foundation
is
to
be
laid
in
the
tenth
class
which
the
child
enters
at
seven
years
old
and
in
which
he
learns
to
read
and
is
turned
on
to
the
declensions
and
conjugations
we
have
for
all
classes
the
exact
and
also
specimens
of
the
questions
put
in
examination
by
the
boy
of
the
next
class
a
hint
which
was
not
thrown
away
upon
the
jesuits
sturm
cries
over
the
superior
advantages
of
the
roman
children
was
but
twenty
when
he
delivered
his
speeches
in
behalf
of
quintius
and
roscius
but
in
these
days
where
is
there
the
man
even
of
eighty
who
could
make
such
speeches
yet
there
are
books
enough
and
intellect
enough
what
need
we
further
we
need
the
latin
language
and
a
correct
method
of
teaching
both
these
we
must
have
before
we
can
arrive
at
the
summit
of
sturm
did
not
like
rabelais
put
greek
on
a
level
with
latin
or
above
it
the
reading
of
greek
words
is
begun
in
the
sixth
class
hebrew
sturm
did
not
himself
learn
till
he
was
nearly
sixty
with
a
thousand
boys
in
his
school
and
carrying
on
correspondence
with
the
leading
sovereigns
of
his
age
sturm
was
a
model
of
the
successful
man
but
in
the
end
religious
was
too
much
even
for
him
and
he
was
dismissed
from
his
post
by
his
opponents
old
age
and
other
surely
the
need
not
have
been
mentioned
sturm
was
then
eighty
years
old
the
successful
man
in
every
age
is
the
man
who
chooses
a
popular
and
attainable
object
and
shows
tremendous
energy
in
pursuit
of
it
most
people
know
precisely
what
they
want
and
among
the
few
who
do
or
more
fail
through
lack
of
energy
but
sturm
was
quite
clear
in
his
aim
and
having
settled
the
means
he
showed
immense
energy
and
strength
of
will
in
going
through
with
them
he
wanted
to
restore
the
language
of
cicero
and
ovid
and
to
give
his
pupils
great
power
of
elegant
expression
in
that
language
like
all
schoolmasters
he
professed
that
piety
and
knowledge
which
in
more
modern
phrase
would
be
wisdom
and
knowledge
should
come
first
but
like
most
schoolmasters
he
troubled
himself
mainly
if
not
exclusively
about
the
art
of
expression
as
an
abstract
proposition
the
schoolmaster
admits
that
to
have
in
your
head
something
worth
saying
is
more
important
than
to
have
the
power
of
expression
ready
in
case
anything
worth
saying
should
but
the
art
always
has
taken
and
i
suppose
in
the
main
always
will
take
for
its
material
the
means
of
expression
and
by
preference
it
chooses
a
tongue
not
vulgar
or
of
the
thus
the
schoolmasters
with
sturm
at
their
head
set
themselves
to
teach
words
and
allowed
their
pupils
to
study
nothing
else
not
even
the
mother
tongue
the
satirist
who
wrote
hudibras
has
stated
for
us
the
sooner
are
the
organs
of
the
brain
quick
to
receive
and
stedfast
to
retain
best
knowledges
but
laid
out
upon
retrieving
of
the
curse
of
babylon
and
he
that
is
but
able
to
express
no
sense
in
several
languages
will
pass
for
learneder
than
he
known
to
speak
the
strongest
reason
in
his
one
of
the
scholars
of
the
renascence
hieronymus
wolf
was
wise
enough
to
see
that
there
might
be
no
small
merit
in
a
silence
minima
pueri
virtus
est
tacere
cum
recte
loqui
quoted
by
parker
but
this
virtue
of
silence
was
not
encouraged
by
sturm
and
he
determined
that
by
the
age
of
sixteen
his
pupils
should
have
a
fair
command
of
expression
in
latin
and
some
knowledge
of
greek
latin
indeed
was
to
supplant
the
mother
tongue
and
boys
were
to
be
severely
punished
for
using
their
own
language
by
this
we
may
judge
of
the
pernicious
effects
of
following
sturm
and
it
is
a
mistake
to
suppose
that
the
unwisdom
of
tilting
at
the
vernacular
was
not
so
much
as
of
the
age
in
which
he
lived
the
typical
english
schoolmaster
of
the
century
mulcaster
was
in
this
and
many
other
ways
greatly
in
advance
of
sturm
to
him
it
was
plain
that
we
should
for
that
most
which
we
ever
use
most
because
we
need
it
the
only
need
recognized
by
sturm
was
need
of
the
classical
languages
thus
he
and
his
admirers
led
the
unlucky
schoolboy
straight
into
that
of
in
which
he
has
struggled
ever
since
for
some
sense
but
found
no
bottom
there
so
learned
and
floundered
on
in
mere
iv
schools
of
the
jesuits
since
the
revival
of
learning
no
body
of
men
has
played
so
prominent
a
part
in
education
as
the
jesuits
with
characteristic
sagacity
and
energy
they
soon
seized
on
education
as
a
to
power
and
influence
and
with
their
talent
for
organization
they
framed
a
system
of
schools
which
drove
all
important
competitors
from
the
field
and
made
jesuits
the
instructors
of
catholic
and
even
to
some
extent
of
protestant
europe
their
skill
in
this
capacity
is
attested
by
the
highest
authorities
by
bacon
and
by
descartes
the
latter
of
whom
had
himself
been
their
pupil
and
it
naturally
met
with
its
reward
for
more
than
one
hundred
years
nearly
all
the
foremost
men
throughout
christendom
both
among
the
clergy
and
laity
had
received
the
jesuit
training
and
in
most
cases
retained
for
life
an
attachment
to
their
old
masters
about
these
jesuit
so
celebrated
and
so
powerful
and
still
existing
in
great
numbers
though
little
remains
of
their
original
does
not
seem
to
be
much
information
accessible
to
the
english
reader
i
have
therefore
collected
the
following
particulars
about
them
and
refer
any
one
who
is
dissatisfied
with
so
meagre
an
account
to
the
works
which
i
have
consulted
the
jesuit
schools
as
i
said
still
exist
but
they
did
their
great
work
in
other
centuries
and
i
therefore
prefer
to
speak
of
them
as
things
of
the
past
when
the
jesuits
were
first
formally
recognized
by
a
bull
of
paul
iii
in
the
bull
stated
that
the
order
was
formed
among
other
things
for
the
purpose
of
instructing
boys
and
ignorant
persons
in
the
christian
but
the
society
well
understood
that
secular
was
more
in
demand
than
religious
learning
and
they
offered
the
more
valued
instruction
that
they
might
have
the
opportunity
of
inculcating
lessons
which
to
the
society
at
least
were
the
more
valuable
from
various
popes
they
obtained
powers
for
founding
schools
and
colleges
for
giving
degrees
and
for
lecturing
publicly
at
universities
their
foundations
rapidly
extended
in
the
romance
countries
except
in
france
where
they
were
long
in
overcoming
the
opposition
of
the
regular
clergy
and
of
the
university
of
paris
over
the
teutonic
and
slavonic
countries
they
spread
their
influence
first
by
means
of
national
colleges
at
rome
where
boys
of
the
different
nations
were
trained
as
missionaries
but
in
time
the
jesuits
pushed
their
camps
forward
even
into
the
heart
of
the
country
the
system
of
education
to
be
adopted
in
all
the
jesuit
institutions
was
settled
during
the
generalship
of
aquaviva
in
that
general
appointed
a
school
commission
consisting
of
six
distinguished
jesuits
from
the
various
countries
of
europe
these
spent
nearly
a
year
in
rome
in
study
and
consultation
and
the
fruit
of
their
labours
was
the
of
the
atque
institutio
studiorum
societatis
this
however
did
not
take
its
final
form
till
twelve
other
commissioners
had
been
at
work
upon
it
it
was
then
revised
and
approved
by
aquaviva
and
the
fifth
and
sixth
general
assemblies
by
this
code
the
jesuit
schools
were
governed
till
when
the
curriculum
was
enlarged
so
as
to
include
physical
science
and
modern
languages
the
jesuits
who
formed
the
those
who
had
taken
all
the
vows
had
spent
from
fifteen
to
eighteen
years
in
preparation
two
years
as
novices
and
one
as
approved
scholars
during
which
they
were
engaged
chiefly
in
religious
exercises
three
years
in
the
study
of
philosophy
and
mathematics
four
years
of
theology
and
in
the
case
of
the
more
distinguished
students
two
years
more
in
repetition
and
private
theological
study
at
some
point
in
this
course
mostly
after
the
philosophy
the
students
were
sent
for
a
while
to
teach
the
to
boys
the
method
of
teaching
was
to
be
learnt
in
the
training
schools
called
juvenats
one
of
which
was
founded
in
each
province
few
even
of
the
most
distinguished
students
received
dispensation
from
giving
elementary
instruction
salmeron
and

performed
this
duty
in

lainez
in
florence
borgia
who
had
been
viceroy
of
catalonia
in
cordova
canisius
in
cologne
during
the
time
the
jesuit
held
his
post
as
teacher
he
was
to
give
himself
up
entirely
to
the
work
his
private
studies
were
abandoned
his
religious
exercises
shortened
he
began
generally
with
the
boys
in
the
lowest
form
and
that
he
might
be
able
to
study
the
character
of
his
pupils
he
went
up
the
school
with
them
advancing
a
step
every
year
as
in
the
system
now
common
in
scotland
but
some
forms
were
always
taught
as
the
highest
is
in
scotland
by
the
same
master
who
remained
a
teacher
for
life
great
care
was
to
be
taken
that
the
frequent
changes
in
the
staff
of
masters
did
not
lead
to
alteration
in
the
conduct
of
the
school
each
teacher
was
bound
to
carry
on
the
established
instruction
by
the
established
methods
all
his
personal
peculiarities
and
opinions
were
to
be
as
much
as
possible
suppressed
to
secure
this
a
rigid
system
of
supervision
was
adopted
and
reports
were
furnished
by
each
officer
to
his
immediate
superior
over
all
stood
the
general
of
the
order
next
came
the
provincial
appointed
by
the
general
over
each
college
was
the
rector
who
was
appointed
for
three
years
by
the
general
though
he
was
responsible
to
the
provincial
and
made
his
reports
to
him
next
came
the
prefect
of
studies
appointed
not
by
the
rector
but
by
the
provincial
the
teachers
were
carefully
watched
both
by
the
rector
and
the
prefect
of
studies
and
it
was
the
duty
of
the
latter
to
visit
each
teacher
in
his
class
at
least
once
a
fortnight
to
hear
him
teach
the
other
authorities
besides
the
masters
of
classes
were
usually
a
house
prefect
and
monitors
selected
from
the
boys
one
in
each
form
the
school
or

was
to
be
built
and
maintained
by
gifts
and
bequests
which
the
society
might
receive
for
this
purpose
only
their
instruction
was
always
given
gratuitously
when
sufficient
funds
were
raised
to
support
the
officers
teachers
and
at
least
twelve
scholars
no
effort
was
to
be
made
to
increase
them
but
if
they
fell
short
of
this
donations
were
to
be
sought
by
begging
from
house
to
house
want
of
money
however
was
not
a
difficulty
which
the
jesuits
often
experienced
the
jesuit
education
included
two
courses
of
study
superiora
et
in
the
smaller
colleges
only
the
were
carried
on
and
it
is
to
these
that
the
following
account
mainly
refers
the
boys
usually
began
this
course
at
ten
years
old
and
ended
it
at
sixteen
the
pupils
in
the
jesuit
colleges
were
of
two
kinds
those
who
were
training
for
the
order
and
had
passed
the
novitiate
the
externs
who
were
pupils
merely
when
the
building
was
not
filled
by
the
first
of
these
the
scholastici
or
as
they
are
called
in
the
jesuit
writings
other
pupils
were
taken
in
to
board
who
had
to
pay
simply
the
cost
of
their
living
and
not
even
this
unless
they
could
well
afford
it
instruction
as
i
said
was
gratuitous
to
all
receive
gratis
give
was
the
rule
so
they
would
neither
make
any
charge
for
instruction
nor
accept
any
gift
that
was
burdened
with
conditions
faithful
to
the
tradition
of
the
catholic
church
the
society
did
not
estimate
a
worth
simply
according
to
his
birth
and
outward
circumstances
the
constitutions
expressly
laid
down
that
poverty
and
mean
extraction
were
never
to
be
any
hindrance
to
a
admission
and
sacchini
says
not
let
any
favouring
of
the
higher
classes
interfere
with
the
care
of
meaner
pupils
since
the
birth
of
all
is
equal
in
adam
and
the
inheritance
in
the
externs
who
could
not
be
received
into
the
building
were
boarded
in
licensed
houses
which
were
always
liable
to
an
unexpected
visit
from
the
prefect
of
studies
the
was
arranged
in
five
classes
since
increased
to
eight
of
which
the
lowest
usually
had
two
divisions
parallel
classes
were
formed
wherever
the
number
of
pupils
was
too
great
for
five
masters
the
names
given
to
the
several
divisions
were
as
follows
infima
media
classis
grammaticæ
suprema
humanitas
rhetorica
each
was
in
a
year
except
rhetorica
which
required
two
years
stöckl
jesuits
and
protestants
alike
in
the
sixteenth
and
seventeenth
centuries
thought
of
little
but
literary
instruction
and
that
too
connected
only
with
latin
and
greek
the
of
the
teaching
in
the
jesuit
schools
was
to
be
grammaticam
quod
ad
rhetoricam
poësim
et
historiam
pertinet
in
addition
to
grammar
whatever
related
to
rhetoric
poetry
and
history
reading
and
writing
the
might
not
be
taught
without
special
leave
from
the
provincial
latin
was
as
much
as
possible
to
supersede
all
other
languages
even
in
speaking
and
nothing
else
might
be
used
by
the
pupils
in
the
higher
forms
on
any
day
but
a
holiday
to
gain
a
supply
of
latin
words
for
ordinary
use
the
pupils
committed
to
memory
latin
conversations
on
general
topics
such
as
francis
and
although
many
good
were
written
by
the
jesuits
a
great
part
of
their
teaching
was
given
orally
the
master
was
in
fact
a
lecturer
who
expounded
sometimes
a
piece
of
a
latin
or
greek
author
sometimes
the
rules
of
grammar
the
pupils
were
required
to
get
up
the
substance
of
these
lectures
and
to
learn
the
and
parts
of
the
classical
authors
by
heart
the
master
for
his
part
had
to
bestow
great
pains
on
the
preparation
of
his
lectures
written
exercises
translations
were
given
in
on
every
day
except
saturday
and
the
master
had
if
possible
to
go
over
each
one
with
its
writer
and
his
appointed
rival
or
the
method
of
hearing
the
rules
committed
to
memory
was
this
boys
in
each
class
who
were
called
decurions
repeated
their
tasks
to
the
master
and
then
in
his
presence
heard
the
other
boys
repeat
theirs
the
master
meanwhile
corrected
the
written
exercises
one
of
the
leading
peculiarities
in
the
system
was
the
pains
they
took
to
foster
ingenii
puerilis
calcar
whetstone
of
talent
the
spur
of
for
this
purpose
all
the
boys
in
the
lower
part
of
the
school
were
arranged
in
pairs
each
pair
being
rivals
to
one
another
every
boy
was
to
be
constantly
on
the
watch
to
catch
his
rival
tripping
and
was
immediately
to
correct
him
besides
this
individual
rivalry
every
class
was
divided
into
two
hostile
camps
called
rome
and
carthage
which
had
frequent
pitched
battles
of
questions
on
set
subjects
these
were
the
in
which
the
boys
sometimes
had
to
put
questions
to
the
opposite
camp
sometimes
to
expose
erroneous
answers
when
the
questions
were
asked
by
the
master
see
appendix
class
matches
emulation
indeed
was
encouraged
to
a
point
where
as
it
seems
to
me
it
must
have
endangered
the
good
feeling
of
the
boys
among
themselves
jouvency
mentions
a
practice
of
appointing
mock
defenders
of
any
particularly
bad
exercise
who
should
make
the
author
of
it
ridiculous
by
their
excuses
and
any
boy
whose
work
was
very
discreditable
was
placed
on
a
form
by
himself
with
a
daily
punishment
until
he
could
show
that
some
one
deserved
to
change
places
with
him
in
the
higher
classes
a
better
kind
of
rivalry
was
cultivated
by
means
of
voluntary
associations
for
study
which
met
together
under
the
superintendence
of
a
master
to
read
themes
translations
and
to
discuss
passages
from
the
classics
the
new
members
were
elected
by
the
old
and
to
be
thus
elected
was
a
distinction
in
these
academies
the
cleverer
students
got
practice
for
the
disputations
which
formed
an
important
part
of
the
school
work
of
the
higher
classes
there
was
a
vast
number
of
other
expedients
by
which
the
jesuits
sought
to
work
on
their
such
as
on
the
one
hand
the
weekly
publication
of
offences
and
on
the
other
besides
prizes
which
could
be
won
only
by
the
externs
titles
and
badges
of
honour
and
the
like
are
says
jouvency
of
expedients
of
this
sort
all
tending
to
sharpen
the
wits
to
lighten
the
labour
of
the
master
and
to
free
him
from
the
invidious
and
troublesome
necessity
of
the
were
remarkably
short
two
hours
and
a
half
in
the
morning
and
the
same
in
the
afternoon
with
a
whole
holiday
a
week
in
summer
and
a
half
holiday
in
winter
the
time
was
spent
in
the
first
form
after
the
following
manner
the
first
the
master
corrected
the
exercises
of
the
previous
day
while
the
decurions
heard
the
lesson
which
had
been
learnt
by
heart
then
the
master
heard
the
piece
of
latin
which
he
had
explained
on
the
previous
day
with
this
construing
was
connected
a
great
deal
of
parsing
conjugating
declining
the
teacher
then
explained
the
piece
for
the
following
day
which
in
this
form
was
never
to
exceed
four
lines
the
last
of
the
morning
was
spent
in
explaining
grammar
this
was
done
very
slowly
and
carefully
in
the
words
of
the
diebus
fere
singula
præcepta
inculcanda
take
a
single
rule
and
drive
it
in
several
for
the
first
hour
of
the
afternoon
the
master
corrected
exercises
and
the
boys
learnt
grammar
if
there
was
time
the
master
put
questions
about
the
grammar
he
had
explained
in
the
morning
the
second
hour
was
taken
up
with
more
explanations
of
grammar
and
the
school
closed
with
half
an
concertation
or
the
master
corrected
the
notes
which
the
pupils
had
taken
during
the
day
in
the
other
forms
the
work
was
very
similar
to
this
except
that
greek
was
added
and
also
in
the
higher
classes
a
little
mathematics
it
will
be
observed
from
the
above
account
that
almost
all
the
strength
of
the
jesuit
teaching
was
thrown
into
the
study
of
the
latin
language
which
was
to
be
used
not
only
for
reading
but
also
in
writing
and
speaking
but
under
the
name
of
some
amount
of
instruction
in
other
subjects
especially
in
history
and
geography
was
given
in
explaining
or
rather
lecturing
on
the
classical
authors
jouvency
says
that
this
lecture
must
consist
of
the
following
parts
the
general
meaning
of
the
whole
passage
the
explanation
of
each
clause
both
as
to
the
meaning
and
construction
any
information
such
as
accounts
of
historical
events
or
of
ancient
manners
and
customs
which
could
be
connected
with
the
text
in
the
higher
forms
applications
of
the
rules
of
rhetoric
and
poetry
an
examination
of
the
latinity
the
inculcation
of
some
moral
lesson
this
treatment
of
a
subject
he
illustrates
by
examples
among
these
is
an
account
of
a
lesson
for
the
first
lowest
class
in
the
fable
of
the
fox
and
the
mask
comes
the
argument
and
the
explanation
of
words
the
grammar
and
parsing
as
a
substantive
of
the
third
declension
like
here
the
master
is
always
to
give
among
his
examples
some
which
the
boys
already
know
comes
the
about
foxes
about
tragedy
about
the
brain
and
hence
about
other
parts
of
the
head
latinity
the
order
of
the
words
choice
of
the
words
synonyms
then
the
sentences
may
be
parodied
other
suitable
substantives
may
be
found
for
the
adjectives
and
and
every
method
is
to
be
adopted
of
showing
the
boys
how
to
the
words
they
have
learnt
lastly
comes
the
moral
the
practical
teacher
will
be
tempted
to
ask
how
is
the
attention
of
the
class
to
be
kept
up
whilst
all
this
information
is
given
this
the
jesuits
did
partly
by
punishing
the
inattentive
every
boy
was
subsequently
required
to
reproduce
what
the
teacher
had
said
and
to
show
his
written
notes
of
it
but
no
doubt
this
matter
of
attention
was
found
a
difficulty
jouvency
tells
the
teachers
to
break
off
from
time
to
time
in
their
lectures
and
to
ask
questions
and
he
adds
sunt
artes
excitandæ
attentionis
quas
docebit
usus
et
sua
cuique
industria
various
are
the
devices
for
arousing
attention
these
will
occur
with
practice
and
for
private
study
besides
written
exercises
and
learning
by
heart
the
pupils
were
recommended
subjects
to
get
up
in
their
own
time
and
in
this
and
also
as
to
the
length
of
some
of
the
regular
lessons
they
were
permitted
to
decide
for
themselves
here
as
everywhere
the
jesuits
trusted
to
the
sense
of
honour
and
who
did
extra
work
were
praised
and
rewarded
one
of
the
maxims
of
this
system
was
mater
every
lesson
was
connected
with
two
before
it
began
of
preceding
work
and
the
other
at
the
close
of
the
work
just
done
besides
this
one
day
a
week
was
devoted
entirely
to
repetition
in
the
three
lowest
classes
the
desire
of
laying
a
solid
foundation
even
led
to
the
second
six
months
in
the
year
being
given
to
again
going
over
the
work
of
the
first
six
months
by
this
means
boys
of
extraordinary
ability
could
pass
through
these
forms
in
eighteen
months
instead
of
three
years
in
work
was
the
one
thing
insisted
on
sacchini
says
that
much
time
should
be
spent
in
going
over
the
more
important
things
which
are
multorum
fontes
et
capita
as
it
were
the
sources
and
starting
points
of
many
others
and
that
the
master
should
prefer
to
teach
a
few
things
perfectly
to
giving
indistinct
impressions
of
many
things
we
should
remember
however
that
the
pupils
of
the
jesuits
were
not
subjects
such
as
grammar
can
not
by
any
expenditure
of
time
and
trouble
be
perfectly
taught
to
children
because
children
can
not
perfectly
understand
them
so
that
the
jesuit
thoroughness
is
not
always
attainable
the
usual
duration
of
the
course
in
the
lower
schools
was
six
one
year
in
each
of
the
four
lower
classes
and
two
years
in
the
highest
class
every
year
closed
with
a
very
formal
examination
before
this
examination
took
place
the
pupils
had
lessons
in
the
manner
of
it
so
that
they
might
come
prepared
not
only
with
a
knowledge
of
the
subjects
but
also
of
the
laws
of
writing
for
examination
ad
examen
the
examination
was
conducted
by
a
commission
appointed
for
the
purpose
of
which
commission
the
prefect
of
studies
was
an
member
the
masters
of
the
classes
though
they
were
present
and
could
make
remarks
were
not
of
the
examining
body
for
the
the
boys
were
ushered
in
three
at
a
time
before
the
solemn
conclave
the
results
of
the
examination
both
written
and
verbal
were
joined
with
the
records
of
the
work
done
in
the
past
year
and
the
names
of
those
pupils
who
had
distinguished
themselves
were
then
published
in
order
of
merit
but
the
poll
was
arranged
alphabetically
or
according
to
birthplace
as
might
be
expected
the
jesuits
were
to
be
very
careful
of
the
moral
and
religious
training
of
their
pupils
maxime
in
vitæ
probitate
ac
bonis
artibus
doctrinaque
proficiant
ad
dei
quoted
by
schmid
and
sacchini
tells
the
master
to
remember
how
honourable
his
office
is
as
it
has
to
do
not
with
grammar
only
but
also
with
the
science
and
practice
of
a
christian
and
religious
life
eo
quidem
ordine
ut
ipsa
ingenii
eruditio
sit
expolitio
morum
et
humana

divinæ
ancilletur
each
lesson
was
to
begin
with
prayer
or
the
sign
of
the
cross
the
pupils
were
to
hear
mass
every
morning
and
were
to
be
urged
to
frequent
confession
and
receiving
of
the
holy
communion
the
father
confessor
was
always
a
jesuit
but
he
was
not
a
master
in
the
school
the
bodily
health
also
was
to
be
carefully
attended
to
the
pupils
were
not
to
study
too
much
or
too
long
at
a
time
nothing
was
to
be
done
for
a
space
of
from
one
or
two
hours
after
dinner
on
holidays
excursions
were
made
to
farms
in
the
country
punishments
were
to
be
as
light
as
possible
and
the
master
was
to
shut
his
eyes
to
offences
whenever
he
thought
he
might
do
so
with
safety
grave
offences
were
to
be
visited
with
corporal
punishment
performed
by
a
who
was
not
a
member
of
the
order
where
this
chastisement
did
not
have
a
good
effect
the
pupil
was
to
be
expelled
the
dry
details
into
which
i
have
been
drawn
by
faithfully
copying
the
manner
of
the
may
seem
to
the
reader
to
afford
no
answer
to
the
question
which
naturally
suggests
what
did
the
of
the
jesuits
owe
its
enormous
popularity
but
in
part
at
least
these
details
do
afford
an
answer
they
show
us
that
the
jesuits
were
intensely
practical
the
hardly
contains
a
single
principle
but
what
it
does
is
points
out
a
perfectly
attainable
goal
and
carefully
defines
the
road
by
which
that
goal
is
to
be
approached
for
each
class
was
prescribed
not
only
the
work
to
be
done
but
also
the
end
to
be
kept
in
view
thus
method
reigned
not
the
best
method
as
the
object
to
be
attained
was
assuredly
not
the
highest
the
method
such
as
it
was
was
applied
with
undeviating
exactness
in
this
particular
the
jesuit
schools
contrasted
strongly
with
their
rivals
of
old
as
indeed
with
the
ordinary
school
of
the
present
day
the
head
master
who
is
to
the
modern
english
school
what
the
general
provincial
rector
prefect
of
studies
and
combined
were
to
a
school
of
the
jesuits
has
perhaps
no
standard
in
view
up
to
which
the
boy
should
have
been
brought
when
his
school
course
is
completed
the
masters
of
forms
teach
just
those
portion
of
their
subject
in
which
they
themselves
are
interested
in
any
way
that
occurs
to
them
with
by
no
means
uniform
success
so
that
when
two
forms
are
examined
with
the
same
examination
paper
it
is
no
very
uncommon
occurrence
for
the
lower
to
be
found
superior
to
the
higher
it
is
perhaps
to
be
expected
that
a
course
in
which
uniform
method
tends
to
a
definite
goal
would
on
the
whole
be
more
successful
than
one
in
which
a
boy
has
to
accustom
himself
by
turns
to
different
methods
invented
at
haphazard
by
individual
masters
with
different
aims
in
view
if
indeed
they
have
any
aim
at
all
i
have
said
that
the
object
which
the
jesuits
proposed
in
their
teaching
was
not
the
highest
object
they
did
not
aim
at
developing
the
faculties
of
their
pupils
but
mainly
the
receptive
and
reproductive
faculties
when
the
young
man
had
acquired
a
thorough
mastery
of
the
latin
language
for
all
purposes
when
he
was
well
versed
in
the
theological
and
philosophical
opinions
of
his
preceptors
when
he
was
skilful
in
dispute
and
could
make
a
brilliant
display
from
the
resources
of
a
memory
he
had
reached
the
highest
point
to
which
the
jesuits
sought
to
lead
him
originality
and
independence
of
mind
love
of
truth
for
its
own
sake
the
power
of
reflecting
and
of
forming
correct
judgments
were
not
merely
were
suppressed
in
the
system
but
in
what
they
attempted
they
were
eminently
successful
and
their
success
went
a
long
way
towards
securing
their
popularity
their
popularity
was
due
moreover
to
the
means
employed
as
well
as
to
the
result
attained
the
jesuit
teachers
were
to
not
drive
their
pupils
to
make
their
learning
not
merely
endurable
but
even
acceptable
non
modo
tolerabilem
sed
etiam
sacchini
expresses
himself
very
forcibly
on
this
subject
is
says
he
unvarying
decision
of
wise
men
whether
in
ancient
or
modern
times
that
the
instruction
of
youth
will
be
always
best
when
it
is
pleasantest
whence
this
application
of
the
word
the
tenderness
of
youth
requires
of
us
that
we
should
not
overstrain
it
its
innocence
that
we
should
abstain
from
harshness
that
which
enters
into
willing
ears
the
mind
as
it
were
runs
to
welcome
seizes
with
avidity
carefully
stows
away
and
faithfully
the
pupils
were
therefore
to
be
encouraged
in
every
way
to
take
kindly
to
their
learning
with
this
end
in
view
and
no
doubt
other
objects
also
the
masters
were
carefully
to
seek
the
affections
pupils
love
the
master
says
sacchini
will
soon
love
his
teaching
let
him
therefore
show
an
interest
in
everything
that
concerns
them
and
not
merely
in
their
studies
let
him
rejoice
with
those
that
rejoice
and
not
disdain
to
weep
with
those
that
weep
after
the
example
of
the
apostle
let
him
become
a
little
one
amongst
little
ones
that
he
may
make
them
adult
in
christ
and
christ
adult
in
them
let
him
unite
the
grave
kindness
and
authority
of
a
father
with
a
in
order
that
learning
might
be
pleasant
to
the
pupils
it
was
necessary
that
they
should
not
be
overtasked
to
avoid
this
the
master
had
to
study
the
character
and
capacity
of
each
boy
in
his
class
and
to
keep
a
book
with
all
particulars
about
him
and
marks
from
one
to
six
indicating
proficiency
thus
the
master
formed
an
estimate
of
what
should
be
required
and
the
amount
varied
considerably
with
the
pupil
though
the
quality
of
the
work
was
always
to
be
good
not
only
was
the
work
not
to
be
excessive
it
was
never
to
be
of
great
difficulty
even
the
grammar
was
to
be
made
as
easy
and
attractive
as
possible
think
it
a
says
sacchini
introduce
at
an
early
stage
the
more
thorny
difficulties
of
grammar
for
when
the
pupils
have
become
familiar
with
the
earlier
parts
use
will
by
degrees
make
the
more
difficult
clear
to
them
his
mind
expanding
and
his
judgment
ripening
as
he
grows
older
the
pupil
will
often
see
for
himself
that
which
he
could
hardly
be
made
to
see
by
others
moreover
in
reading
an
author
examples
of
grammatical
difficulties
will
be
more
easily
observed
in
connection
with
the
context
and
will
make
more
impression
on
the
mind
than
if
they
are
taught
in
an
abstract
form
by
themselves
let
them
then
be
carefully
explained
whenever
they
perhaps
no
body
of
men
in
europe
the
thugs
may
in
this
respect
rival
them
in
asia
have
been
so
hated
as
the
jesuits
i
once
heard
frederick
denison
maurice
say
he
thought
kingsley
could
find
good
in
every
one
except
the
jesuits
and
he
added
he
thought
could
find
good
even
in
them
but
why
should
a
devoted
christian
find
a
difficulty
in
seeing
good
in
the
jesuits
a
body
of
men
whose
devotion
to
their
idea
of
christian
duty
has
never
been
surpassed
the
difficulty
arose
from
differences
in
ideal
both
held
that
the
ideal
christian
would
do
everything
the
greater
glory
of
god
or
as
the
jesuits
put
it
in
their
fashion
majorem
dei
but
maurice
and
kingsley
thought
of
a
divine
idea
for
every
man
the
idea
lost
sight
of
the
individual
like
their
enemy
carlyle
the
jesuits
in
effect
worshipped
strength
but
carlyle
thought
of
the
strength
of
the
individual
the
jesuits
of
the
strength
of
catholic
catholic
was
to
them
the
manifested
kingdom
of
god
everything
therefore
that
gave
power
to
the
church
tended
the
company
of
jesus
was
the
regular
army
of
the
church
so
arguing
logically
from
their
premises
they
made
the
glory
of
god
and
the
success
of
the
society
convertible
terms
thus
their
conception
was
a
purely
military
conception
a
if
he
were
an
ardent
patriot
and
a
great
general
would
do
all
he
could
to
make
the
army
powerful
he
would
care
much
for
the
health
morals
and
training
of
the
soldiers
but
always
with
direct
reference
to
the
army
he
would
attend
to
everything
that
made
a
man
a
better
soldier
beyond
this
he
would
not
concern
himself
in
his
eyes
the
army
would
be
everything
and
a
soldier
nothing
but
a
part
of
it
just
as
a
link
is
only
a
part
of
a
chain
paulsen
speaking
of
the
jesuits
says
truly
that
no
great
organization
can
exist
without
a
root
idea
the
root
idea
of
the
army
is
the
sacrifice
and
annihilation
of
the
individual
that
the
body
may
be
fused
together
and
so
gain
a
strength
greater
than
that
of
any
number
of
individuals
formed
on
this
idea
the
army
acts
all
together
and
in
obedience
to
a
single
will
and
no
mob
can
stand
its
charge
ignatius
loyola
and
succeeding
generals
took
up
this
idea
and
formed
an
army
for
the
church
an
army
that
became
the
wonder
and
the
terror
of
all
men
never
as
compayré
says
had
a
body
been
so
sagaciously
organized
or
had
wielded
so
great
resources
for
good
and
for
evil
buisson
ij
to
the
english
schoolmaster
the
jesuits
must
always
be
interesting
if
for
no
other
reason
at
least
for
they
were
so
intensely
practical
jésuites
ne
sont
pas
des
pédagogues
assez
desintéressés
pour
nous
jesuits
as
schoolmasters
says
compayré
not
disinterested
enough
for
buisson
sub
ad
but
disinterested
pedagogy
is
not
much
to
the
mind
of
the
englishman
it
does
not
seem
to
know
quite
what
it
would
be
after
and
deals
in
generalities
such
as
is
not
a
means
but
an
end
and
the
end
being
somewhat
indefinite
the
means
are
still
more
wanting
in
precision
this
vagueness
is
what
the
english
master
hates
he
prefers
not
to
trouble
himself
about
the
end
the
wisdom
of
his
ancestors
has
settled
that
and
he
can
direct
his
attention
to
what
really
interests
practical
details
in
this
he
resembles
the
jesuits
the
end
has
been
settled
for
them
by
their
founder
they
revel
in
practical
details
in
which
they
are
truly
great
and
here
we
may
learn
much
from
them
applied
to
says
father
eyre
naturally
means
than
and
our
is
essentially
a
method
or
system
of
teaching
and
here
is
a
method
that
has
been
worked
uniformly
and
with
singular
success
for
three
centuries
and
can
still
give
a
good
account
of
its
old
rivals
but
will
it
hold
its
own
against
the
late
reformers
as
regards
intellectual
training
the
new
school
seeks
to
draw
out
the
faculties
of
the
young
mind
by
employing
them
on
subjects
in
which
it
is
the
jesuits
fixed
a
course
of
study
which
as
they
frankly
recognized
could
not
be
made
interesting
so
they
endeavoured
to
secure
accuracy
by
constant
repetition
and
relied
for
industry
on
two
motive
powers
the
personal
influence
of
the
master
and
spur
of
to
acquire
has
ever
been
the
main
object
of
the
society
and
his
devotion
to
this
object
makes
a
great
distinction
between
the
jesuit
and
most
other
instructors
his
notion
of
the
task
was
thus
expressed
by
father
gerard
at
the
educational
conference
of
is
an
art
amongst
arts
to
be
worthy
of
the
name
it
must
be
the
work
of
an
individual
upon
individuals
the
true
teacher
must
understand
appreciate
and
sympathize
with
those
who
are
committed
to
him
he
must
be
daily
discovering
what
there
is
and
undoubtedly
there
is
something
in
each
of
them
capable
of
fruitful
development
and
contriving
how
better
to
get
at
them
and
to
evoke
whatever
possibilities
there
are
in
them
for
the
jesuit
master
then
tried
to
gain
influence
over
the
boys
and
to
use
that
influence
for
many
purposes
to
make
them
work
well
being
one
of
these
but
not
perhaps
the
most
important
as
for
emulation
no
instructors
have
used
it
so
elaborately
as
the
jesuits
in
most
english
schools
the
prizes
have
no
effect
whatever
except
on
the
first
three
or
four
boys
and
the
marking
is
so
arranged
that
those
who
take
the
lead
in
the
first
few
lessons
can
keep
their
position
without
much
effort
this
clumsy
system
would
not
suit
the
jesuits
they
often
for
divide
a
class
into
a
number
of
small
groups
the
boys
in
each
group
being
approximately
equal
and
a
prize
is
offered
for
each
group
the
class
matches
too
stimulate
the
weaker
pupils
even
more
than
the
strong
in
conclusion
i
will
give
the
chief
points
of
the
system
in
the
words
of
one
of
its
advocates
and
admirers
who
was
himself
educated
at
stonyhurst
us
now
try
to
put
together
the
various
pieces
of
this
school
machinery
and
study
the
effect
we
have
seen
that
the
boys
have
masters
entirely
at
their
disposition
not
only
at
class
time
but
at
recreation
time
after
supper
in
the
night
reading
rooms
each
day
they
record
victory
or
defeat
in
the
recurring
exercises
or
themes
upon
various
matters
by
the
quarterly
papers
or
examinations
in
composition
for
which
nine
hours
are
assigned
the
order
of
merit
is
fixed
and
this
order
entails
many
little
privileges
and
precedencies
in
chapel
refectory
class
room
and
elsewhere
each
master
if
he
prove
a
success
and
his
health
permit
continues
to
be
the
instructor
of
the
boys
in
his
class
during
the
space
of
six
years
is
says
sheil
in
his
account
of
stonyhurst
much
of
a
acquirements
and
a
good
deal
of
the
character
of
his
taste
must
have
depended
upon
the
individual
to
whose
instructions
he
was
thus
almost
exclusively
and
in
many
cases
the
effects
must
be
a
greater
interest
felt
in
the
students
by
their
teachers
a
mutual
attachment
founded
on
long
acquaintance
and
a
more
thorough
knowledge
on
the
part
of
the
master
of
the
weak
and
strong
points
of
his
pupils
add
to
the
above
the
and
system
the
effect
of
challenges
and
class
combats
of
the
wearing
of
decorations
and
medals
by
the
imperators
on
sundays
festival
days
concertation
days
and
examination
days
of
the
extraordinary
much
more
as
than
as
to
give
individuality
to
the
exertions
which
might
otherwise
be
merged
in
the
routine
work
of
the
class
and
the
given
for
improvement
on
wet
evenings
and
after
night
prayers
add
the
honours
matter
the
reports
read
before
the
rector
and
all
subordinate
superiors
the
professors
and
whole
body
of
students
add
the
competition
in
each
class
and
between
the
various
classes
and
even
between
the
various
colleges
in
england
of
the
society
and
only
one
conclusion
can
be
arrived
at
it
is
a
system
which
everyone
is
free
to
admire
or
think
inferior
to
some
other
preferred
by
him
but
it
a
college
present
and
by
hewitson
edition
pp
ff
yes
it
a
system
a
system
built
up
by
the
united
efforts
of
many
astute
intellects
and
showing
marvellous
skill
in
selecting
means
to
attain
a
clearly
conceived
end
there
is
then
in
the
history
of
education
little
that
should
be
more
interesting
or
might
be
more
instructive
to
the
master
of
an
english
public
school
than
the
chapter
about
the
jesuits
rabelais
to
great
geniuses
it
is
given
to
think
themselves
in
a
measure
free
from
the
ordinary
notions
of
their
time
and
often
to
anticipate
the
discoveries
of
a
future
age
in
all
literature
there
is
perhaps
hardly
a
more
striking
instance
of
this
thinking
than
we
find
in
account
of
the
education
of
gargantua
we
see
in
rabelais
an
enthusiasm
for
learning
and
a
tendency
to
verbal
realism
that
is
he
turned
to
the
old
writers
for
instruction
about
so
far
he
was
a
child
of
the
renascence
but
in
other
respects
he
advanced
far
beyond
it
after
a
scornful
account
of
the
ordinary
school
books
and
methods
by
which
gargantua
he
studied
hard
did
nevertheless
profit
nothing
but
only
grew
thereby
foolish
simple
dolted
and
blockish
rabelais
decides
that
were
better
for
him
to
learn
nothing
at
all
than
to
be
taught
suchlike
books
under
suchlike
all
this
old
lumber
must
be
swept
away
and
in
two
years
a
youth
may
acquire
a
better
judgment
a
better
manner
and
more
command
of
language
than
could
ever
have
been
obtained
by
the
old
method
we
are
then
introduced
to
the
model
pupil
the
end
of
education
has
been
declared
to
be
et
eloquens
and
we
find
that
though
rabelais
might
have
substituted
knowledge
for
piety
he
did
care
for
piety
and
valued
very
highly
both
wisdom
and
eloquence
the
eloquent
roman
was
the
ideal
of
the
renascence
and
model
pupil
expresses
himself
gestures
so
proper
pronunciation
so
distinct
a
voice
so
eloquent
language
so
well
turned
in
such
good
that
he
seemed
rather
a
gracchus
a
cicero
an
æmilius
of
the
time
past
than
a
youth
of
the
present
so
a
renascence
tutor
is
appointed
for
gargantua
and
administers
to
him
a
potion
that
makes
him
forget
all
he
has
ever
learned
he
then
puts
him
through
a
very
different
course
like
all
wise
instructors
he
first
endeavours
to
secure
the
will
of
the
pupil
he
allows
gargantua
to
go
the
accustomed
road
till
he
can
convince
him
it
is
the
wrong
one
this
seems
to
me
a
remarkable
proof
of
wisdom
how
often
does
the
break
abruptly
with
the
past
and
raise
the
opposition
of
the
pupil
by
dispraise
of
all
he
has
already
done
by
degrees
ponocrates
the
model
tutor
inspired
in
his
pupil
a
great
desire
for
improvement
this
he
did
by
bringing
him
into
the
society
of
learned
men
who
filled
him
with
ambition
to
be
like
them
thereupon
gargantua
himself
into
such
a
train
of
study
that
he
lost
not
any
hour
in
the
day
but
employed
all
his
time
in
learning
and
honest
the
day
was
to
begin
at
with
reading
of
chapter
of
the
holy
scripture
and
oftentimes
he
gave
himself
to
revere
adore
pray
and
send
up
his
supplications
to
that
good
god
whose
word
did
show
his
majesty
and
marvellous
this
is
the
only
hint
we
get
in
this
part
of
the
book
on
the
subject
of
religious
or
moral
education
the
training
is
directed
to
the
intellect
and
the
body
the
remarkable
feature
in
curriculum
is
this
that
it
is
concerned
mainly
with
of
the
seven
liberal
arts
of
the
middle
ages
the
first
three
were
purely
formal
grammar
logic
rhetoric
while
the
following
course
arithmetic
geometry
astronomy
and
music
were
not
the
effect
of
the
renascence
was
to
cause
increasing
neglect
of
the
quadrivium
but
rabelais
cares
for
the
quadrivium
only
gargantua
studies
arithmetic
geometry
astronomy
and
music
and
the
trivium
is
not
mentioned
great
use
is
made
of
books
and
gargantua
learned
them
by
heart
but
all
that
he
learned
he
at
once
to
practical
cases
concerning
the
estate
of
it
was
the
substance
of
the
reading
not
the
form
that
was
thought
of
at
dinner
they
thought
good
they
continued
reading
or
began
to
discourse
merrily
together
speaking
first
of
the
virtue
propriety
efficacy
and
nature
of
all
that
was
served
in
at
that
table
of
bread
of
wine
of
water
of
salt
of
flesh
fish
fruits
herbs
roots
and
of
their
dressing
by
means
whereof
he
learned
in
a
little
time
all
the
passages
that
on
these
subjects
are
to
be
found
in
pliny
athenæus
whilst
they
talked
of
these
things
many
times
to
be
more
certain
they
caused
the
very
books
to
be
brought
to
the
table
and
so
well
and
perfectly
did
he
in
his
memory
retain
the
things
above
said
that
in
that
time
there
was
not
a
physician
that
knew
half
so
much
as
he
again
out
of
doors
he
was
to
observe
trees
and
plants
and
them
with
what
is
written
of
them
in
the
books
of
the
ancients
such
as
theophrastus
dioscorides
here
again
actual
realism
was
to
be
joined
with
verbal
realism
for
gargantua
was
to
carry
home
with
him
great
handfuls
for
herborising
rabelais
even
recommends
studying
the
face
of
the
heavens
at
night
and
then
observing
the
change
that
has
taken
place
at
in
the
morning
so
he
seems
to
have
been
the
first
writer
on
education
and
the
first
by
a
long
interval
who
would
teach
about
things
by
observing
the
things
themselves
it
was
this
of
pestalozzi
extended
and
claimed
as
his
invention
two
centuries
and
a
half
later
rabelais
also
gives
a
hint
of
the
use
of
as
well
as
gargantua
and
his
fellows
recreate
themselves
in
bottling
hay
in
cleaving
and
sawing
wood
and
in
threshing
sheaves
of
corn
in
the
barn
they
also
studied
the
art
of
painting
or
the
course
was
further
connected
with
life
by
visits
to
the
various
handicraftsmen
in
whose
workshops
did
learn
and
consider
the
industry
and
invention
of
the
thus
even
in
the
time
of
the
renascence
rabelais
saw
that
the
life
of
the
intellect
might
be
nourished
by
many
things
besides
books
but
books
were
still
kept
in
the
highest
place
even
on
a
holiday
which
occurred
on
some
fine
and
clear
day
once
a
month
spent
without
books
or
lecture
yet
was
the
day
not
without
profit
for
in
the
meadows
they
repeated
certain
pleasant
verses
of
of
hesiod
of
they
also
turned
latin
epigrams
into
french
this
course
of
study
at
first
it
seemed
difficult
yet
soon
became
so
sweet
so
easy
and
so
delightful
that
it
seemed
rather
the
recreation
of
a
king
than
the
study
of
a
in
preferring
the
quadrivial
studies
to
the
trivial
and
still
more
in
his
use
of
actual
things
rabelais
separates
himself
from
all
the
teachers
of
his
time
very
remarkable
too
is
the
attention
he
pays
to
physical
education
a
day
does
not
pass
on
which
gargantua
does
not
gallantly
exercise
his
body
as
he
has
already
exercised
his
mind
the
exercises
prescribed
are
very
various
and
include
running
jumping
swimming
with
practice
on
the
horizontal
bar
and
with
but
in
one
respect
rabelais
seems
behind
our
own
writer
richard
mulcaster
mulcaster
trained
the
body
simply
with
a
view
to
health
rabelais
is
thinking
of
the
gentleman
and
all
his
physical
exercises
are
to
prepare
him
for
the
occupation
war
the
constant
preparation
for
war
had
a
strong
and
in
some
respects
a
very
beneficial
influence
on
the
education
of
gentlemen
in
the
fifteen
and
sixteen
hundreds
as
it
has
had
on
that
of
the
germans
in
the
eighteen
hundreds
but
to
be
ready
to
slaughter
fellow
creatures
is
not
an
ideal
aim
in
education
and
besides
this
one
half
of
the
human
race
can
never
as
far
as
we
can
judge
at
present
be
affected
by
it
we
therefore
prefer
the
physical
training
recommended
by
the
englishman
walter
besant
by
his
in
blackwood
has
put
wit
and
wisdom
where
we
can
get
at
most
of
it
without
searching
in
the
but
he
has
unfortunately
omitted
letter
to
pantagruel
at
paris
book
ij
chap
where
we
get
the
curriculum
as
proposed
by
rabelais
a
chapter
in
which
no
scavenger
is
needed
i
will
give
some
extracts
from
it
my
deceased
father
of
happy
memory
grangousier
had
bent
his
best
endeavours
to
make
me
profit
in
all
perfection
and
political
knowledge
and
that
my
labour
and
study
was
fully
correspondent
to
yea
went
beyond
his
desire
nevertheless
the
time
then
was
not
so
proper
and
fit
for
learning
as
it
is
at
present
neither
had
i
plenty
of
such
good
masters
as
thou
hast
had
for
that
time
was
darksome
obscured
with
clouds
of
ignorance
and
savouring
a
little
of
the
infelicity
and
calamity
of
the
goths
who
had
wherever
they
set
footing
destroyed
all
good
literature
which
in
my
age
hath
by
the
divine
goodness
been
restored
unto
its
former
light
and
dignity
and
that
with
such
amendment
and
increase
of
knowledge
that
now
hardly
should
i
be
admitted
unto
the
first
form
of
the
little
grammar
school
boys
petits
i
say
i
who
in
my
youthful
days
was
and
that
justly
reputed
the
most
learned
of
that
age
now
it
is
that
the
old
knowledges
are
restored
the
languages
revived
greek
without
which
it
is
a
shame
for
any
one
to
call
himself
learned
hebrew
chaldee
latin
printing
too
so
elegant
and
exact
is
in
use
which
in
my
day
was
invented
by
divine
inspiration
as
cannon
were
by
suggestion
of
the
devil
all
the
world
is
full
of
men
of
knowledge
of
very
learned
teachers
of
large
libraries
so
that
it
seems
to
me
that
neither
in
the
age
of
plato
nor
of
cicero
nor
of
papinian
was
there
such
convenience
for
studying
as
there
is
now
i
see
the
robbers
hangmen
adventurers
ostlers
of
more
learned
then
the
doctors
and
the
preachers
of
my
youth
why
women
and
girls
have
aspired
to
the
heavenly
manna
of
good
learning
i
mean
you
to
learn
the
languages
perfectly
first
of
all
the
greek
as
quintilian
wishes
then
the
latin
then
hebrew
for
the
scriptures
and
chaldee
and
arabic
at
the
same
time
and
that
thou
form
thy
style
in
greek
on
plato
in
latin
on
cicero
let
there
be
no
history
which
thou
hast
not
ready
in
thy
memory
in
which
cosmography
will
aid
thee
of
the
liberal
arts
geometry
arithmetic
music
i
have
given
thee
a
taste
when
thou
wast
still
a
child
at
the
age
of
five
or
six
pantagruel
was
a
giant
we
must
remember
carry
them
on
and
thou
all
the
rules
of
astronomy
touch
astrology
for
divination
and
the
art
of
lullius
which
are
mere
vanity
in
the
civil
law
thou
must
know
the
five
texts
by
heart
as
for
knowledge
of
the
works
of
nature
i
would
have
thee
devote
thyself
to
them
so
that
there
may
be
no
sea
river
or
spring
of
which
thou
knowest
not
the
fishes
all
the
birds
of
the
air
all
the
trees
forest
or
orchard
all
the
herbs
of
the
field
all
the
metals
hid
in
the
bowels
of
the
earth
all
the
precious
stones
of
the
east
and
the
south
let
nothing
be
unknown
to
thee
turn
again
with
diligence
to
the
books
of
the
greek
physicians
and
the
arabs
and
the
latin
without
despising
the
talmudists
and
the
cabalists
and
by
frequent
dissections
acquire
a
perfect
knowledge
of
the
other
world
which
is
man
and
some
hours
begin
to
read
the
sacred
writings
first
in
greek
the
new
testament
and
epistles
of
the
apostles
then
in
hebrew
the
old
testament
in
brief
let
me
see
thee
an
abyss
and
bottomless
pit
of
knowledge
for
from
henceforth
as
thou
growest
great
and
becomest
a
man
thou
must
part
from
this
tranquillity
and
rest
of
study
and
because
as
solomon
saith
wisdom
entereth
not
into
a
malicious
mind
and
science
without
conscience
is
but
the
ruin
of
the
soul
thou
shouldst
serve
love
and
fear
god
and
in
him
centre
all
thy
thoughts
all
thy
hope
and
by
faith
rooted
in
charity
be
joined
to
him
so
as
never
to
be
separated
from
him
by
the
influence
of
rabelais
on
montaigne
locke
and
rousseau
has
been
well
traced
by
arnstädt
leipzig
barth
vi
montaigne
the
learned
ideal
established
by
the
renascence
was
accepted
by
rabelais
though
he
made
some
suggestions
about
that
seem
to
us
much
in
advance
of
it
when
he
quotes
the
saying
magnos
clericos
non
sunt
magis
magnos
greatest
clerks
are
not
the
greatest
this
singular
piece
of
latinity
is
appropriately
put
into
the
mouth
of
a
monk
who
represents
everything
the
renascence
scholars
despised
in
montaigne
we
strike
into
a
new
vein
of
thought
and
we
find
that
what
the
monk
alleges
in
defence
of
his
ignorance
the
cultured
gentleman
adopts
as
the
expression
of
an
important
truth
we
ordinary
people
see
truths
indeed
but
we
see
them
indistinctly
and
are
not
completely
guided
by
them
it
is
reserved
for
men
of
genius
to
see
truths
some
truths
that
is
often
a
very
few
with
intense
clearness
some
of
these
men
have
no
great
talent
for
speech
or
writing
and
they
try
to
express
the
truths
they
see
not
so
much
by
books
as
by
action
such
men
in
education
were
comenius
pestalozzi
and
froebel
but
sometimes
the
man
of
genius
has
a
great
power
over
language
and
then
he
finds
for
the
truths
he
has
seen
fitting
expression
which
becomes
almost
as
lasting
as
the
truths
themselves
such
men
were
montaigne
and
rousseau
if
the
historian
of
education
is
asked
did
montaigne
do
he
will
answer
did
froebel
say
said
a
great
deal
but
very
few
people
can
read
him
and
still
fewer
understand
both
however
are
and
must
remain
forces
in
education
montaigne
has
given
to
some
truths
imperishable
form
in
his
and
ideas
come
home
to
all
the
world
in
the
kindergarten
the
ideal
set
up
by
the
renascence
attached
the
highest
importance
to
learning
montaigne
maintained
that
the
resulting
training
at
its
was
not
suited
to
a
gentleman
or
man
of
action
virtue
wisdom
and
intellectual
activity
should
be
thought
of
before
learning
education
should
be
first
and
foremost
the
development
and
exercise
of
faculties
and
even
if
the
acquirement
of
knowledge
is
thought
of
montaigne
maintains
that
the
pedants
do
not
understand
the
first
conditions
of
knowledge
and
give
a
semblance
not
the
true
ne
faut
pas
attacher
le
savoir
à
il
faut
can
not
be
fastened
on
to
the
mind
it
must
become
part
and
parcel
of
the
mind
here
then
we
have
two
separate
counts
against
the
renascence
education
is
not
the
main
thing
knowledge
is
something
very
different
from
knowing
by
heart
it
is
a
pity
utterances
about
education
are
to
be
found
in
english
only
in
the
complete
translation
of
his
essays
seeing
that
a
good
many
millions
of
people
read
english
and
are
most
of
them
concerned
in
education
one
may
hope
that
some
day
the
sayings
of
the
shrewd
old
frenchman
may
be
offered
them
in
a
convenient
form
here
are
some
of
them
evil
comes
of
the
foolish
way
in
which
our
instructors
set
to
work
and
on
the
plan
on
which
we
are
taught
no
wonder
if
neither
scholars
nor
masters
become
more
able
whatever
they
may
do
in
becoming
more
learned
in
truth
the
trouble
and
expense
of
our
fathers
are
directed
only
to
furnish
our
heads
with
knowledge
not
a
word
of
judgment
or
virtue
cry
out
to
our
people
about
a
a
learned
man
and
about
another
a
good
man
they
will
be
all
agog
after
the
learned
man
and
will
not
look
at
the
good
man
one
might
fairly
raise
a
third
cry
a
set
of
numskulls
we
are
ready
enough
to
ask
he
know
greek
or
know
latin
does
he
write
verse
or
write
prose
but
whether
he
has
become
wiser
or
better
should
be
the
first
question
and
that
is
always
the
last
we
ought
to
find
out
not
who
knows
but
who
knows
i
chap
page
or
two
beyond
the
true
educators
according
to
montaigne
were
the
spartans
who
despised
literature
and
cared
only
for
character
and
action
at
athens
they
thought
about
words
at
sparta
about
things
at
athens
boys
learnt
to
speak
well
at
sparta
to
do
well
at
athens
to
escape
from
sophistical
arguments
and
to
face
all
attempts
to
deceive
them
at
sparta
to
escape
from
the
allurements
of
pleasure
and
to
face
the
slings
and
arrows
of
outrageous
fortune
even
death
itself
in
the
one
system
there
was
constant
exercise
of
the
tongue
in
the
other
of
the
soul
it
is
not
strange
that
when
antipater
demanded
of
the
spartans
fifty
children
as
hostages
they
replied
they
would
sooner
give
twice
as
many
grown
men
such
store
did
they
set
by
their
ad
it
is
odd
to
find
a
man
of
the
fifteen
hundreds
who
quotes
from
the
old
authors
at
every
turn
and
yet
maintains
that
lean
so
much
on
the
arm
of
other
people
that
we
lose
our
own
the
thing
a
boy
should
learn
is
not
what
the
old
authors
say
but
he
himself
ought
to
do
when
he
becomes
a
wisdom
not
knowledge
may
become
learned
from
the
learning
of
others
wise
we
can
never
be
except
by
our
own
bk
j
chap
so
entirely
was
montaigne
detached
from
the
thought
of
the
renascence
that
he
scoffs
at
his
own
learning
and
declares
that
true
learning
has
for
its
subject
not
the
past
or
the
future
but
the
present
are
truly
learned
from
knowing
the
present
not
from
knowing
the
past
any
more
than
the
and
yet
toil
only
to
stuff
the
memory
and
leave
the
conscience
and
the
understanding
void
and
like
birds
who
fly
abroad
to
forage
for
grain
bring
it
home
in
their
beak
without
tasting
it
themselves
to
feed
their
young
so
our
pedants
go
picking
knowledge
here
and
there
out
of
several
authors
and
hold
it
at
their
end
only
to
spit
it
out
and
distribute
it
amongst
their
are
all
richer
than
we
think
but
they
drill
us
in
borrowing
and
begging
and
lead
us
to
make
more
use
of
other
goods
than
of
our
bk
iij
chap
la
beg
of
paragraph
so
far
montaigne
what
do
we
schoolmasters
say
to
all
this
if
we
would
be
quite
candid
i
think
we
must
allow
that
after
reading
essay
we
put
it
down
with
the
conviction
that
in
the
main
he
was
right
and
that
he
had
proved
the
error
and
absurdity
of
a
vast
deal
that
goes
on
in
the
schoolroom
but
from
this
first
view
we
have
had
on
reflection
to
make
several
drawbacks
montaigne
like
locke
and
rousseau
who
followed
in
his
steps
arranges
for
every
boy
to
have
a
tutor
entirely
devoted
to
him
we
may
question
whether
this
method
of
bringing
up
children
is
desirable
and
we
may
assert
without
question
that
in
most
cases
it
is
impossible
it
seems
ordained
that
at
every
stage
of
life
we
should
require
the
companionship
of
those
of
our
own
age
if
we
take
two
beings
as
little
alike
as
a
man
and
a
child
and
force
them
to
be
each
companions
so
great
is
the
difference
in
their
thoughts
and
interests
that
they
will
fall
into
inevitable
boredom
and
restraint
so
we
see
that
this
plan
even
in
the
few
cases
in
which
it
would
be
possible
would
not
be
desirable
and
for
the
great
majority
of
boys
it
would
be
out
of
the
question
we
must
then
arrange
for
the
young
to
be
taught
not
as
individuals
but
in
classes
and
this
greatly
changes
the
conditions
of
the
problem
one
of
the
first
conditions
is
this
that
we
have
to
employ
each
class
regularly
and
uniformly
for
some
hours
every
day
schoolmasters
know
what
their
mentors
forget
we
can
make
a
class
learn
but
broadly
speaking
we
can
not
make
a
class
think
still
less
can
we
make
it
judge
as
a
great
deal
of
occupation
has
to
be
provided
we
are
therefore
forced
to
make
our
pupils
learn
whatever
may
be
the
value
of
the
learning
in
itself
it
is
absolutely
necessary
no
doubt
it
will
make
a
vast
difference
whether
we
consider
the
learning
mainly
as
employment
as
a
means
of
taking
up
time
and
preventing
as
locke
boldly
calls
it
or
whether
we
are
chiefly
anxious
to
secure
some
special
results
the
knowledge
of
the
latin
and
greek
languages
and
the
latin
and
greek
authors
was
a
result
so
highly
prized
by
the
renascence
scholars
that
they
insisted
on
a
prodigious
quantity
of
learning
not
as
employment
but
simply
as
the
means
of
acquiring
this
knowledge
as
the
knowledge
got
to
be
less
esteemed
the
pressure
was
by
degrees
relaxed
in
our
public
schools
fifty
or
sixty
years
ago
the
learning
was
to
some
extent
retained
as
employment
but
there
certainly
was
no
pressure
and
the
majority
of
the
boys
never
learnt
the
ancient
languages
so
the
masters
of
that
time
had
given
up
the
renascence
enthusiasm
for
the
classics
and
on
the
negative
side
of
his
teaching
had
come
to
an
agreement
with
montaigne
any
one
inclined
to
sarcasm
might
say
that
on
the
positive
side
they
were
still
totally
opposed
to
him
for
thought
virtue
and
judgment
were
the
main
things
to
be
cared
for
and
did
not
care
for
these
things
at
all
but
this
is
not
a
fair
statement
the
one
thing
gained
or
supposed
to
be
gained
in
the
public
schools
was
the
art
of
living
and
this
art
though
it
does
not
demand
heroic
virtue
requires
at
least
prudence
and
system
was
a
revolt
against
the
of
the
renascence
our
studies
says
he
presents
itself
before
us
is
book
enough
a
roguish
trick
of
a
page
a
blunder
of
a
servant
a
jest
at
table
are
so
many
new
so
the
education
of
was
in
his
eyes
of
more
value
than
the
education
in
school
and
this
was
acknowledged
also
in
our
public
schools
is
not
the
latin
and
greek
they
learn
or
learn
that
we
consider
so
important
the
masters
used
to
say
it
is
the
tone
of
the
school
and
the
discipline
of
the
but
of
late
years
this
virtual
agreement
with
montaigne
has
been
broken
up
school
work
is
no
longer
mere
employment
but
it
is
done
under
pressure
and
with
penalties
if
the
tale
of
brick
turned
out
does
not
pass
the
inspector
what
has
produced
this
great
change
it
is
due
mainly
to
two
causes
the
pressure
put
on
the
young
to
attain
classical
knowledge
was
relaxed
when
it
was
thought
that
they
could
get
through
life
very
well
without
this
knowledge
but
in
these
days
new
knowledge
has
awakened
a
new
enthusiasm
the
knowledge
of
science
promises
such
great
advantages
that
the
latest
reformers
headed
by
herbert
spencer
seem
to
make
the
of
the
grown
person
depend
mainly
on
the
amount
of
scientific
knowledge
he
stored
up
in
his
youth
this
is
the
first
cause
of
educational
pressure
the
second
and
more
urgent
cause
is
the
rapid
development
of
our
system
of
examinations
educational
status
is
now
settled
by
the
examiner
a
potentate
whose
influence
has
brought
back
in
a
very
malignant
form
all
the
evils
of
which
montaigne
complains
do
what
we
will
the
faculty
chiefly
exercised
in
preparing
for
ordinary
examinations
is
the
so
the
acquisition
of
memory
or
examination
again
come
to
be
regarded
as
the
one
thing
needful
in
education
and
there
is
great
danger
of
everything
else
being
neglected
for
it
of
the
fourfold
results
of
wisdom
good
manners
last
alone
can
be
fairly
tested
in
examinations
and
as
the
very
bread
depends
nowadays
first
on
his
getting
through
examinations
himself
and
then
on
getting
his
pupils
through
he
would
be
more
than
human
if
with
locke
he
thought
of
learning
and
a
great
change
has
come
over
our
public
schools
the
amount
of
work
required
from
the
boys
is
far
greater
than
it
used
to
be
and
masters
again
measure
their
success
by
the
amount
of
knowledge
the
average
boy
takes
away
with
him
it
seems
to
me
high
time
that
another
montaigne
arose
to
protest
that
a
intellectual
life
does
not
consist
in
the
number
of
things
he
remembers
and
that
his
true
life
is
not
his
intellectual
life
only
but
embraces
his
power
of
will
and
action
and
his
love
of
what
is
noble
and
right
cried
of
old
i
am
the
mother
of
fair
love
and
fear
and
knowledge
and
holy
in
these
days
of
science
and
examinations
does
there
not
seem
some
danger
lest
knowledge
should
prove
the
sole
survivor
may
not
knowledge
like
another
cain
raise
its
hand
against
its
brethren
love
and
fear
and
holy
hope
this
is
perhaps
the
great
danger
of
our
time
a
danger
especially
felt
in
education
every
school
parades
its
scholarships
at
the
public
schools
or
at
the
universities
or
its
passes
in
the
oxford
and
cambridge
locals
or
its
percentage
at
the
last
inspection
and
asks
to
be
judged
by
these
and
yet
these
are
not
the
one
thing
or
indeed
the
chief
thing
needful
and
it
will
be
the
ruin
of
true
education
if
as
mark
pattison
said
the
attention
is
concentrated
on
the
least
important
part
of
his
duty
vii
ascham
masters
and
scholars
who
sigh
over
what
seem
to
them
the
intricacies
and
obscurities
of
modern
grammars
may
find
some
consolation
in
thinking
that
after
all
matters
might
have
been
worse
and
that
our
fate
is
enviable
indeed
compared
with
that
of
the
students
of
latin
years
ago
did
the
reader
ever
open
the
of
alexander
de
villa
dei
which
was
the
grammar
in
general
use
from
the
middle
of
the
thirteenth
to
the
end
of
the
fifteenth
century
appendix
if
so
he
is
aware
how
great
a
step
towards
simplicity
was
made
by
our
grammatical
reformers
lily
colet
and
erasmus
indeed
those
whom
we
now
regard
as
the
forgers
of
our
chains
were
in
their
own
opinion
and
that
of
their
contemporaries
the
champions
of
freedom
appendix
i
have
given
elsewhere
appendix
a
remarkable
passage
from
colet
in
which
he
recommends
the
leaving
of
rules
and
the
study
of
examples
in
good
latin
authors
wolsey
also
in
his
directions
to
the
masters
of
ipswich
school
dated
proposes
that
the
boys
should
be
exercised
in
the
eight
parts
of
speech
in
the
first
form
and
should
begin
to
speak
latin
and
translate
from
english
into
latin
in
the
second
if
the
masters
think
fit
they
may
also
let
the
pupils
read
or
from
the
third
upwards
a
regular
course
of
classical
authors
was
to
be
read
and
rules
were
to
be
introduced
by
degrees
i
confess
such
things
are
necessary
writes
wolsey
as
far
as
possible
we
could
wish
them
so
appointed
as
not
to
occupy
the
more
valuable
part
of
the
only
in
the
sixth
form
the
highest
but
two
syntax
was
to
be
begun
in
these
schools
the
time
was
wholly
taken
up
with
latin
and
the
speaking
of
latin
was
enforced
even
in
play
hours
so
we
see
that
anomalies
in
the
accidence
as
taught
in
the
in
were
not
given
till
the
boys
had
been
some
time
using
the
language
and
the
syntax
was
kept
till
they
had
a
good
practical
knowledge
of
the
usages
to
which
the
rules
referred
but
although
there
was
a
great
stir
in
education
throughout
this
century
and
several
english
books
were
published
about
it
we
come
to
before
we
find
anything
that
has
lived
till
now
we
then
have
roger
a
posthumous
work
brought
out
by
widow
and
republished
in
and
the
book
was
then
lost
sight
of
but
reappeared
with
james
upton
as
editor
in
and
has
been
regarded
as
an
educational
classic
ever
since
johnson
says
contains
perhaps
the
best
advice
that
was
ever
given
for
the
study
of
languages
and
professor
b
mayor
who
on
this
point
is
a
higher
authority
than
johnson
declares
that
book
sets
forth
the
only
sound
method
of
acquiring
a
dead
with
all
their
contempt
for
theory
english
schoolmasters
might
have
been
expected
to
take
an
interest
in
one
part
of
the
history
of
education
the
history
of
methods
there
is
a
true
saying
attributed
by
marcel
to
talleyrand
méthodes
sont
les
maîtres
des
is
the
the
history
of
education
shows
us
that
every
subject
of
instruction
has
been
taught
in
various
ways
and
further
that
the
contest
of
methods
has
not
uniformly
ended
in
the
survival
of
the
fittest
methods
then
might
often
teach
the
teachers
if
the
teachers
cared
to
be
taught
but
till
within
the
last
half
century
or
so
an
unintelligent
traditional
routine
has
sufficed
for
them
there
has
no
doubt
been
a
great
change
since
men
now
old
were
at
school
but
in
those
days
the
main
strength
of
the
teaching
was
given
to
latin
and
the
masters
knew
of
no
better
method
of
starting
boys
in
this
language
than
making
them
learn
by
heart
or
as
it
was
then
called
the
eton
latin
grammar
if
reason
had
had
anything
to
do
with
teaching
this
book
would
have
been
demolished
by
richard
published
in
but
worthless
as
johnson
proved
it
to
be
the
grammar
was
for
another
years
treated
by
english
schoolmasters
as
the
only
introduction
to
the
latin
tongue
the
books
that
have
recently
been
published
show
a
tendency
to
revert
to
methods
set
forth
in
reign
in
and
william
of
but
the
innovators
have
not
as
a
rule
been
drawn
to
these
methods
by
historical
inquiry
there
seem
to
be
only
three
english
writers
on
education
who
have
caught
the
ear
of
other
nations
and
these
are
ascham
locke
and
herbert
spencer
of
a
contemporary
we
do
well
to
speak
with
the
same
reserve
as
of
company
but
of
the
other
two
we
may
say
that
the
choice
has
been
somewhat
capricious
perhaps
deserves
the
reputation
and
influence
it
has
always
had
but
in
it
he
hardly
does
himself
justice
as
a
philosopher
of
the
mind
and
much
of
the
advice
which
has
been
considered
his
exclusively
is
to
be
found
in
his
english
predecessors
whose
very
names
are
unknown
except
to
the
educational
antiquarian
ascham
wrote
a
few
pages
on
method
which
entitle
him
to
mention
in
an
account
of
methods
of
he
also
wrote
a
great
many
pages
about
things
in
general
which
would
have
shared
the
fate
of
many
more
valuable
but
long
forgotten
books
had
he
not
had
one
peculiarity
in
which
the
other
writers
were
wanting
that
indescribable
something
which
matthew
arnold
calls
ascham
has
been
very
fortunate
in
his
editors
professor
arber
and
professor
mayor
and
the
last
editions
give
everyone
an
opportunity
of
reading
the
i
shall
therefore
speak
of
nothing
but
the
method
latin
is
to
be
taught
as
follows
let
the
child
learn
the
eight
parts
of
speech
and
then
the
right
joining
together
of
substantives
with
adjectives
the
noun
with
the
verb
the
relative
with
the
antecedent
after
the
concords
are
learned
let
the
master
take
selection
of
epistles
and
read
them
after
this
manner
let
him
teach
the
child
cheerfully
and
plainly
the
cause
and
matter
of
the
letter
then
let
him
construe
it
into
english
so
oft
as
the
child
may
easily
carry
away
the
understanding
of
it
lastly
parse
it
over
perfectly
this
done
then
let
the
child
by
and
by
both
construe
and
parse
it
over
again
so
that
it
may
appear
that
the
child
doubteth
in
nothing
that
his
master
has
taught
him
before
after
this
the
child
must
take
a
paper
book
and
sitting
in
some
place
where
no
man
shall
prompt
him
by
himself
let
him
translate
into
english
his
former
lesson
then
showing
it
to
his
master
let
the
master
take
from
him
his
latin
book
and
pausing
an
hour
at
the
least
then
let
the
child
translate
his
own
english
into
latin
again
in
another
paper
book
when
the
child
bringeth
it
turned
into
latin
the
master
must
compare
it
with
book
and
lay
them
both
together
and
where
the
child
doth
well
praise
him
where
amiss
point
out
why
use
is
better
thus
the
child
will
easily
acquire
a
knowledge
of
grammar
also
the
ground
of
almost
all
the
rules
that
are
so
busily
taught
by
the
master
and
so
hardly
learned
by
the
scholar
in
all
common
schools
we
do
not
contemn
rules
but
we
gladly
teach
rules
and
teach
them
more
plainly
sensibly
and
orderly
than
they
be
commonly
taught
in
common
schools
for
when
the
master
shall
compare
book
with
the
translation
let
the
master
at
the
first
lead
and
teach
the
scholar
to
join
the
rules
of
his
grammar
book
with
the
examples
of
his
present
lesson
until
the
scholar
by
himself
be
able
to
fetch
out
of
his
grammar
every
rule
for
every
example
and
let
the
grammar
book
be
ever
in
the
scholars
hand
and
also
used
by
him
as
a
dictionary
for
every
present
use
this
is
a
lively
and
perfect
way
of
teaching
of
rules
where
the
common
way
used
in
common
schools
to
read
the
grammar
alone
by
itself
is
tedious
for
the
master
hard
for
the
scholar
cold
and
uncomfortable
for
them
and
elsewhere
ascham
says
i
do
wish
that
all
rules
for
young
scholars
were
shorter
than
they
be
for
without
doubt
itself
is
sooner
and
surer
learned
by
examples
of
good
authors
than
by
the
naked
rules
of
you
perceive
your
scholar
to
go
better
on
away
first
with
understanding
his
lesson
more
quickly
with
parsing
more
readily
with
translating
more
speedily
and
perfectly
than
he
was
wont
after
give
him
longer
lessons
to
translate
and
withal
begin
to
teach
him
both
in
nouns
and
verbs
what
is
and
what
is
what
what
which
be
and
which
be
most
notable
in
all
his
lectures

every
lesson
is
to

thus
carefully
analysed
and
entered
under
these
headings
in
a
third
book
here
ascham
leaves
his
method
and
returns
to
it
only
at
the
beginning
of
book
ii
he
there
supposes
the
first
stage
to
be
finished
and
scholar
to
have
come
indeed
first
to
a
ready
perfectness
in
translating
then
to
a
ripe
and
skilful
choice
in
marking
out
his
six
he
now
recommends
a
course
of
cicero
terence
cæsar
and
livy
which
is
to
be
read
good
deal
at
every
and
the
master
is
to
give
passages
into
plain
natural
these
the
scholar
shall
know
where
to
till
he
shall
have
tried
his
hand
at
putting
them
into
latin
then
the
master
shall
forth
the
place
in
in
the
second
book
of
the
ascham
discusses
the
various
branches
of
the
study
then
common
viz
translatio
linguarum
paraphrasis
metaphrasis
epitome
imitatio
declamatio
he
does
not
lay
much
stress
on
any
of
these
except
and
of
the
last
he
says
languages
both
learned
and
be
gotten
and
gotten
only
by
imitation
for
as
ye
use
to
hear
so
ye
use
to
speak
if
ye
hear
no
other
ye
speak
not
yourself
and
whom
ye
only
hear
of
them
ye
only
but
translation
was
his
great
instrument
for
all
kinds
of
learning
translation
he
says
the
most
common
and
most
commendable
of
all
other
exercises
for
youth
most
common
for
all
your
constructions
in
grammar
schools
be
nothing
else
but
translations
but
because
they
be
not
translations
as
i
do
require
they
bring
forth
but
simple
and
single
commodity
and
because
also
they
lack
the
daily
use
of
writing
which
is
the
only
thing
that
breedeth
deep
root
both
in
the
wit
for
good
understanding
and
in
the
memory
for
sure
keeping
of
all
that
is
learned
most
commendable
also
and
that
by
the
judgment
of
all
authors
which
entreat
of
these
after
quoting
pliny
he
says
perceive
how
pliny
teacheth
that
by
this
exercise
of
double
translating
is
learned
easily
sensibly
by
little
and
little
not
only
all
the
hard
congruities
of
grammar
the
choice
of
ablest
words
the
right
pronouncing
of
words
and
sentences
comeliness
of
figures
and
forms
fit
for
every
matter
and
proper
for
every
tongue
but
that
which
is
greater
also
in
marking
daily
and
following
diligently
thus
the
footsteps
of
the
best
authors
like
invention
of
arguments
like
order
in
disposition
like
utterance
in
elocution
is
easily
gathered
up
and
hereby
your
scholar
shall
be
brought
not
only
to
like
eloquence
but
also
to
all
true
understanding
and
rightful
judgment
both
for
writing
and
again
he
says
speedy
attaining
i
durst
venture
a
good
wager
if
a
scholar
in
whom
is
aptness
love
diligence
and
constancy
would
but
translate
after
this
sort
some
little
book
in
tully
as
with
two
epistles
the
first
quintum
fratrem
the
other
that
scholar
i
say
should
come
to
a
better
knowledge
in
the
latin
tongue
than
the
most
part
do
that
spend
from
five
to
six
years
in
tossing
all
the
rules
of
grammar
in
common
after
quoting
the
instance
of
dion
prussæus
who
came
to
great
learning
and
utterance
by
reading
and
following
only
two
books
the
and
de
falsa
he
goes
on
a
better
and
nearer
example
herein
may
be
our
most
noble
queen
elizabeth
who
never
took
yet
greek
nor
latin
grammar
in
her
hand
after
the
first
declining
of
a
noun
and
a
verb
but
only
by
this
double
translating
of
demosthenes
and
isocrates
daily
without
missing
every
forenoon
and
likewise
some
part
of
tully
every
afternoon
for
the
space
of
a
year
or
two
hath
attained
to
such
a
perfect
understanding
in
both
the
tongues
and
to
such
a
ready
utterance
of
the
latin
and
that
with
such
a
judgment
as
there
be
few
now
in
both
universities
or
elsewhere
in
england
that
be
in
both
tongues
comparable
with
her
authority
is
indeed
not
conclusive
on
this
point
as
he
in
praising
the
attainments
was
vaunting
his
own
success
as
a
teacher
and
moreover
if
he
flattered
her
he
could
plead
prevailing
custom
but
we
have
i
believe
abundant
evidence
that
elizabeth
was
an
accomplished
scholar
before
i
leave
ascham
i
must
make
one
more
quotation
to
which
i
shall
more
than
once
have
occasion
to
refer
speaking
of
the
plan
of
double
translation
he
says
the
scholar
have
construed
parsed
twice
translated
over
by
good
advisement
marked
out
his
six
points
by
skilful
judgment
he
shall
have
necessary
occasion
to
read
over
every
lecture
a
times
at
the
which
because
he
shall
do
always
in
order
he
shall
do
it
always
with
pleasure
and
pleasure
allureth
love
love
hath
lust
to
labour
labour
always
obtaineth
his
a
good
deal
has
been
said
and
perhaps
something
learnt
about
the
teaching
of
latin
since
the
days
of
ascham
as
far
as
i
know
the
method
which
ascham
denounced
and
which
most
english
schoolmasters
stuck
to
for
more
than
two
centuries
longer
has
now
been
abandoned
no
one
thinks
of
making
the
beginner
learn
by
heart
all
the
latin
grammar
before
he
is
introduced
to
the
latin
language
to
understand
the
machinery
of
which
an
account
is
given
in
the
grammar
the
learner
must
see
it
at
work
and
must
even
endeavour
in
a
small
way
to
work
it
himself
so
it
seems
pretty
well
agreed
that
the
information
given
in
the
grammar
must
be
joined
with
some
construing
and
some
exercises
from
the
very
first
but
here
the
agreement
ends
our
teachers
consciously
or
in
ignorance
follow
one
or
more
of
a
number
of
methodizers
who
have
examined
the
problem
of
such
men
as
ascham
ratke
comenius
jacotot
hamilton
robertson
and
prendergast
these
naturally
divide
themselves
into
two
parties
which
i
have
ventured
to
call
impressionists
and
the
first
of
these
plunge
the
beginner
into
the
language
and
trust
to
the
great
mass
of
vague
impressions
clearing
and
defining
themselves
as
he
goes
along
the
second
insist
on
his
learning
at
the
first
a
very
small
portion
of
the
language
and
mastering
and
retaining
everything
he
learns
it
will
be
seen
that
in
the
first
stage
of
the
course
ascham
is
a
he
does
not
talk
like
prendergast
of
nor
like
jacotot
does
he
require
the
learner
to
begin
every
lesson
at
the
beginning
of
the
book
but
he
makes
the
pupil
go
over
each
lesson
dozen
times
at
the
least
before
he
may
advance
beyond
it
as
for
his
practice
of
double
translation
for
the
advanced
pupil
it
is
excellent
but
if
it
is
required
from
the
beginner
it
leads
to
unintelligent
memorizing
i
think
i
shall
be
able
to
show
later
on
that
other
methodizers
have
advanced
beyond
ascham
viii
mulcaster
the
history
of
english
thought
on
education
has
yet
to
be
written
in
the
literature
of
education
the
germans
have
been
the
pioneers
and
have
consequently
settled
the
routes
and
when
a
track
has
once
been
established
few
travellers
will
face
the
risk
and
trouble
of
leaving
it
so
up
to
the
present
time
writers
on
the
history
of
european
education
after
the
renascence
have
occupied
themselves
chiefly
with
men
who
lived
in
germany
or
wrote
in
german
but
the
french
are
at
length
exploring
the
country
for
themselves
and
in
time
no
doubt
the
races
will
show
an
interest
in
the
thoughts
and
doings
of
their
common
ancestors
we
know
what
toils
and
dangers
men
will
encounter
in
getting
to
the
source
of
great
rivers
and
although
as
widgery
truly
says
study
of
origins
is
not
business
we
yet
may
hope
that
students
will
be
found
ready
to
give
time
and
trouble
to
an
investigation
of
great
interest
and
perhaps
some
origin
of
the
school
course
which
now
affects
the
millions
who
have
english
for
their
in
the
fifteen
hundreds
there
were
published
several
works
on
education
three
of
which
and
have
been
recently
reprinted
others
such
as
edward
and
are
pretty
sure
to
follow
without
serious
loss
let
us
hope
to
their
editors
though
neither
coote
nor
mulcaster
are
likely
to
become
as
writers
as
roger
ascham
henry
barnard
whose
knowledge
of
our
educational
literature
no
less
than
his
labours
in
it
makes
him
the
greatest
living
authority
says
that
is
of
the
earliest
and
still
one
of
the
best
treatises
in
the
english
series
p
mulcaster
was
one
of
the
most
famous
of
english
schoolmasters
and
by
his
writings
he
proved
that
he
was
far
in
advance
of
the
schoolmasters
of
his
own
time
and
of
the
times
which
succeeded
but
he
paid
the
penalty
of
thinking
of
himself
more
highly
than
he
should
have
thought
and
whether
or
no
the
conjecture
is
right
that
shakespeare
had
him
in
his
mind
when
writing
there
is
an
affectation
in
style
which
is
very
irritating
for
it
has
caused
even
the
master
of
edmund
spenser
to
be
forgotten
in
a
curious
and
interesting
allegory
on
the
progress
of
language
in
the
pp
ff
mulcaster
says
that
art
selects
the
best
age
of
a
language
to
draw
rules
from
such
as
the
age
of
demosthenes
in
greece
and
of
tully
in
rome
and
he
goes
on
a
period
in
the
english
tongue
i
take
to
be
in
our
days
for
both
the
pen
and
the
and
he
suggests
that
the
english
language
having
reached
its
zenith
is
seen
to
advantage
not
in
the
writings
of
shakespeare
or
spenser
but
in
those
of
richard
mulcaster
after
enumerating
the
excellencies
of
the
language
he
adds
need
no
example
in
any
of
these
whereof
my
own
penning
is
a
general
here
we
feel
tempted
to
exclaim
with
armado
in
act
sc
protest
the
schoolmaster
is
exceeding
fantastical
too
too
vain
too
too
he
speaks
elsewhere
of
his
careful
i
will
not
say
so
curious
and
says
very
truly
some
of
reasonable
study
can
hardly
understand
the
couching
of
my
sentence
and
the
depth
of
my
and
this
was
the
of
his
literary
renown
but
there
is
good
reason
why
mulcaster
should
not
be
forgotten
when
we
read
his
books
we
find
that
wisdom
which
we
are
importing
in
the
nineteenth
century
was
in
a
great
measure
offered
us
by
an
english
schoolmaster
in
the
sixteenth
the
latest
advances
in
pedagogy
have
established
that
the
end
and
aim
of
education
is
to
develop
the
faculties
of
the
mind
and
body
that
all
teaching
processes
should
be
carefully
adapted
to
the
mental
constitution
of
the
learner
that
the
first
stage
in
learning
is
of
immense
importance
and
requires
a
very
high
degree
of
skill
in
the
teacher
that
the
brain
of
children
especially
of
clever
children
should
not
be
subjected
to
that
childhood
should
not
be
spent
in
learning
foreign
languages
but
that
its
language
should
be
the
and
its
exercises
should
include
handwork
especially
drawing
that
education
should
be
cared
for
no
less
than
that
the
only
hope
of
improving
our
schools
lies
in
providing
training
for
our
teachers
these
are
all
regarded
as
planks
in
the
platform
of
new
education
and
these
were
all
advocated
by
mulcaster
before
i
point
this
out
in
detail
i
may
remark
how
greatly
education
has
suffered
from
being
confounded
with
learning
there
are
interesting
passages
both
in
ascham
and
mulcaster
which
prove
that
the
of
the
and
was
of
later
growth
in
the
fifteen
hundreds
learning
was
thought
suitable
not
for
the
rich
but
for
the
clever
still
learning
and
therefore
education
was
not
for
the
many
but
the
few
mulcaster
considers
at
some
length
how
the
number
of
the
educated
is
to
be
kept
down
chapp
though
even
here
he
is
in
the
van
and
would
have
everyone
taught
to
read
and
write
chapp
but
the
true
problem
of
education
was
not
faced
till
it
was
discovered
that
every
human
being
was
to
be
considered
in
it
this
was
i
think
first
seen
by
comenius
with
this
abatement
we
find
notions
not
much
behind
our
nineteenth
is
it
not
good
he
asks
have
every
part
of
the
body
and
every
power
of
the
soul
to
be
fined
to
his
best
elsewhere
he
says
end
of
education
and
train
is
to
help
nature
to
her
perfection
which
is
when
all
her
abilities
be
perfected
in
their
habit
whereunto
right
elements
be
right
great
helps
consideration
and
judgment
must
wisely
mark
whereunto
nature
is
either
evidently
given
or
secretly
affectionate
and
must
frame
an
education
consonant
michelet
has
with
justice
claimed
for
montaigne
that
he
drew
the
attention
from
the
thing
to
be
learnt
to
the
le
savoir
mais
le
sujet
p
mulcaster
has
a
claim
to
share
this
honour
with
his
great
contemporary
he
really
laid
the
foundation
of
a
science
of
education
discussing
our
natural
abilities
he
says
have
a
perceiving
by
outward
sense
to
feel
to
hear
to
see
to
smell
to
taste
all
sensible
things
which
qualities
of
the
outward
being
received
in
by
the
and
examined
by
are
delivered
to
and
afterward
prove
our
great
and
only
grounds
unto
further
p
here
we
see
mulcaster
endeavouring
to
base
education
or
as
he
so
well
calls
it
on
what
we
receive
from
nature
elsewhere
he
speaks
of
the
three
things
which
we
peering
out
of
the
little
young
souls
viz
to
take
memory
to
keep
and
discretion
to
p
i
have
pointed
out
that
the
false
ideal
of
the
renascence
led
schoolmasters
to
neglect
children
mulcaster
remarks
that
the
ancients
considered
the
training
of
children
should
date
from
the
birth
but
he
himself
begins
with
the
school
age
here
he
has
the
boldness
to
propose
that
those
who
teach
the
beginners
should
have
the
smallest
number
of
pupils
and
should
receive
the
highest
pay
first
groundwork
would
be
laid
by
the
best
workman
says
mulcaster
here
expressing
a
truth
which
like
many
truths
that
are
not
quite
convenient
is
seldom
denied
but
almost
systematically
ignored
in
the
magazine
for
november
appeared
a
vigorous
protest
with
nearly
signatures
many
of
which
carried
great
weight
with
them
against
our
of
education
to
our
present
system
whether
good
or
bad
is
the
result
of
accident
winchester
and
eton
had
large
endowments
and
naturally
endeavoured
by
means
of
these
endowments
to
get
hold
of
clever
boys
at
first
no
doubt
they
succeeded
fairly
well
but
other
schools
felt
bound
to
compete
for
juvenile
brains
and
as
the
number
of
prizes
increased
many
of
our
preparatory
schools
became
mere
racing
stables
for
children
destined
at
or
to
run
for
thus
in
the
scramble
for
the
money
all
thought
of
education
has
been
lost
sight
of
injury
has
been
done
in
many
cases
to
those
who
have
succeeded
still
greater
injury
to
those
who
have
failed
or
who
have
from
the
first
been
considered
of
the
these
very
serious
evils
would
have
been
avoided
had
we
taken
counsel
with
mulcaster
it
were
for
so
petty
a
gain
to
forego
a
greater
to
win
an
hour
in
the
morning
and
lose
the
whole
day
after
as
those
people
most
commonly
do
which
start
out
of
their
beds
too
early
before
they
be
well
awaked
or
know
what
it
is
and
be
drowsy
when
they
are
up
for
want
of
their
see
also
pp
ff
it
would
have
been
a
vast
gain
to
all
europe
if
mulcaster
had
been
followed
instead
of
sturm
he
was
one
of
the
earliest
advocates
of
the
use
of
english
instead
of
latin
see
appendix
and
good
reading
and
writing
in
english
were
to
be
secured
before
latin
was
begun
his
elementary
course
included
these
five
things
english
reading
english
writing
drawing
singing
playing
a
musical
instrument
if
the
first
course
were
made
to
occupy
the
up
to
the
age
of
mulcaster
held
that
more
would
be
done
between
and
than
between
and
in
the
ordinary
way
there
would
be
the
further
gain
that
the
children
would
not
be
set
against
learning
of
the
too
timely
onset
too
little
is
done
in
too
long
a
time
and
the
school
is
made
a
torture
which
as
it
brings
forth
delight
in
the
end
when
learning
is
held
fast
so
should
it
pass
on
very
pleasantly
by
the
way
while
it
is
in
among
the
many
changes
brought
about
in
the
nineteenth
century
we
find
little
that
can
compare
in
importance
with
the
advance
in
the
education
of
women
in
the
last
century
whenever
a
woman
exercised
her
mental
powers
she
had
to
do
it
by
stealth
and
her
position
was
degraded
indeed
when
compared
not
only
with
her
descendants
of
the
nineteenth
century
but
also
with
her
ancestors
of
the
sixteenth
this
i
know
has
been
disputed
by
some
authorities
by
the
late
professor
brewer
but
to
others
to
a
man
who
as
regards
honesty
and
wisdom
has
had
few
equals
and
no
superiors
in
investigating
the
course
of
education
i
mean
the
late
joseph
payne
this
educational
superiority
of
the
women
of
time
has
seemed
to
be
entirely
beyond
question
on
this
point
evidence
is
very
valuable
and
to
me
at
least
conclusive
he
not
only
young
maidens
to
learn
but
says
that
stands
for
him
and
that
custom
of
my
country
hath
made
the
train
her
own
approved
p
of
all
the
educational
reforms
of
the
nineteenth
century
by
far
the
most
fruitful
and
most
expansive
is
in
my
opinion
the
training
of
teachers
in
this
as
in
most
educational
matters
the
english
though
advancing
are
in
the
rear
far
more
is
made
of
on
the
continent
and
in
the
united
states
than
in
england
and
yet
we
made
a
good
start
our
early
writers
on
education
saw
that
the
teacher
has
immense
influence
and
that
to
turn
this
influence
to
good
account
he
must
have
made
a
study
of
his
profession
and
have
learnt
best
that
has
been
thought
and
in
it
every
occupation
in
life
has
a
traditional
capital
of
knowledge
and
experience
and
those
who
intend
to
follow
the
business
whatever
it
may
be
are
required
to
go
through
some
kind
of
training
or
apprenticeship
before
they
earn
wages
to
this
rule
there
is
but
one
exception
in
english
elementary
schools
children
are
paid
to
children
and
in
the
higher
schools
the
beginner
is
allowed
to
blunder
at
the
expense
of
his
first
pupils
into
whatever
skill
he
may
in
the
end
manage
to
pick
up
but
our
english
practice
received
no
encouragement
from
the
early
english
writers
mulcaster
brinsley
and
hoole
as
far
as
i
am
aware
the
first
suggestion
of
a
training
college
for
teachers
came
from
mulcaster
he
schemed
seven
special
colleges
at
the
university
and
of
these
one
is
for
teachers
some
of
his
suggestions
about
have
lately
been
adopted
though
without
acknowledgment
and
as
the
university
of
cambridge
has
since
acknowledged
the
existence
of
teachers
and
appointed
a
training
syndicate
we
may
perhaps
in
a
few
centuries
more
carry
out
his
scheme
and
have
training
colleges
at
oxford
and
cambridge
some
of
the
reasons
he
gives
us
have
not
gone
out
of
date
with
his
english
they
are
as
follows
why
should
not
these
men
the
teachers
have
both
this
sufficiency
in
learning
and
such
room
to
rest
in
thence
to
be
chosen
and
set
forth
for
the
common
service
be
either
children
or
schools
so
small
a
portion
of
our
multitude
or
is
the
framing
of
young
minds
and
the
training
of
their
bodies
so
mean
a
point
of
cunning
be
schoolmasters
in
this
realm
such
a
paucity
as
they
are
not
even
in
good
sadness
to
be
soundly
thought
on
if
the
chancel
have
a
minister
the
belfry
hath
a
master
and
where
youth
is
as
it
is
eachwhere
there
must
be
trainers
or
there
will
be
worse
he
that
will
not
allow
of
this
careful
provision
for
such
a
seminary
of
masters
is
most
unworthy
either
to
have
had
a
good
master
himself
or
hereafter
to
have
a
good
one
for
his
why
should
not
teachers
be
well
provided
for
to
continue
their
whole
life
in
the
school
as
do
in
their
several
professions
thereby
judgment
cunning
and
discretion
will
grow
in
them
and
masters
would
prove
old
men
and
such
as
setteth
over
children
in
the
schooling
of
whereas
now
the
school
being
used
but
for
a
shift
afterward
to
pass
thence
to
the
other
professions
though
it
send
out
very
sufficient
men
to
them
itself
remaineth
too
too
naked
considering
the
necessity
of
the
thing
i
conclude
therefore
that
this
trade
requireth
a
particular
college
for
these
four
causes
first
for
the
subject
being
the
mean
to
make
or
mar
the
whole
fry
of
our
state
secondly
for
the
number
whether
of
them
that
are
to
learn
or
of
them
that
are
to
teach
thirdly
for
the
necessity
of
the
profession
which
may
not
be
spared
fourthly
for
the
matter
of
their
study
which
is
comparable
to
the
greatest
professions
for
language
for
judgment
for
skill
how
to
train
for
variety
in
all
points
of
learning
wherein
the
framing
of
the
mind
and
the
exercising
of
the
body
craveth
exquisite
consideration
beside
the
staidness
of
the
pp
though
once
a
celebrated
man
and
moreover
the
master
of
edmund
spenser
mulcaster
has
been
long
forgotten
but
when
the
history
of
education
in
england
comes
to
be
written
the
historian
will
show
that
few
schoolmasters
in
the
fifteen
hundreds
or
since
were
so
enlightened
as
the
first
headmaster
of
merchant
ix
ratichius
the
history
of
education
in
the
fifteen
hundreds
tells
chiefly
of
two
very
different
classes
of
men
first
we
have
the
practical
men
who
set
themselves
to
supply
the
general
demand
for
instruction
in
the
classical
languages
this
class
includes
most
of
the
successful
schoolmasters
such
as
sturm
trotzendorf
neander
and
the
jesuits
the
other
class
were
thinkers
who
never
attempted
to
teach
but
merely
gave
form
to
truths
which
would
in
the
end
affect
teaching
these
were
especially
rabelais
and
montaigne
with
the
sixteen
hundreds
we
come
to
men
who
have
earned
for
themselves
a
name
unpleasant
in
our
ears
although
it
might
fittingly
be
applied
to
all
the
greatest
benefactors
of
the
human
race
i
mean
the
name
of
these
men
were
not
successful
at
least
they
seemed
unsuccessful
to
their
contemporaries
who
contrasted
the
promised
results
with
the
actual
but
their
efforts
were
by
no
means
thrown
away
and
posterity
at
least
has
acknowledged
its
obligations
to
them
one
sees
now
that
they
could
hardly
have
expected
justice
in
their
own
time
it
is
safe
to
adopt
the
customary
plan
it
is
safe
to
speculate
how
that
plan
may
and
should
be
altered
but
it
is
dangerous
to
attempt
to
translate
new
thought
into
new
action
and
boldly
to
advance
without
a
track
trusting
to
principles
which
may
like
the
compass
show
you
the
right
direction
but
like
the
compass
will
give
you
no
hint
of
the
obstacles
that
lie
before
you
the
chief
demands
made
by
the
innovators
have
been
that
the
study
of
should
precede
or
be
united
with
the
study
of
appendix
that
knowledge
should
be
communicated
where
possible
by
appeals
to
the
senses
that
all
linguistic
study
should
begin
with
that
of
the
that
latin
and
greek
should
be
taught
to
such
boys
only
as
would
be
likely
to
complete
a
learned
education
that
physical
education
should
be
attended
to
in
all
classes
of
society
for
the
sake
of
health
not
simply
with
a
view
to
gentlemanly
accomplishments
that
a
new
method
of
teaching
should
be
adopted
framed
to
their
notions
of
method
have
of
course
been
very
various
but
their
systems
mostly
agree
in
these
particulars
they
proceed
from
the
concrete
to
the
abstract
giving
some
knowledge
of
the
thing
itself
before
the
rules
which
refer
to
it
they
employ
the
student
in
analysing
matter
put
before
him
rather
than
in
working
synthetically
according
to
precept
they
require
the
student
to
and
investigate
for
himself
under
the
superintendence
and
guidance
of
the
master
rather
than
be
taught
by
the
master
and
receive
anything
on
the
authority
they
rely
on
the
interest
excited
in
the
pupil
by
the
acquisition
of
knowledge
and
renounce
coercion
only
that
which
is
understood
may
be
committed
to
memory
supra
the
first
of
the
innovators
was
wolfgang
ratichius
who
oddly
enough
is
known
to
posterity
by
a
name
he
and
his
contemporaries
never
heard
of
his
name
was
radtké
or
ratké
and
the
son
having
received
a
university
education
translated
this
into
ratichius
with
our
usual
impatience
of
redundant
syllables
we
have
attempted
to
reduce
the
word
to
its
original
dimensions
and
in
the
process
have
hit
upon
which
is
a
new
name
altogether
ratke
to
adopt
the
true
form
of
the
original
was
connected
as
basedow
was
a
hundred
and
fifty
years
later
with
holstein
and
hamburg
he
was
born
at
wilster
in
holstein
in
and
studied
at
hamburg
and
at
the
university
of
rostock
he
afterwards
travelled
to
amsterdam
and
to
england
and
it
was
perhaps
owing
to
his
residence
in
this
country
that
he
was
acquainted
with
the
new
philosophy
of
bacon
we
next
hear
of
him
at
the
electoral
diet
held
as
usual
in
in
he
was
then
over
forty
years
old
and
he
had
elaborated
a
new
scheme
for
teaching
like
all
inventors
he
was
fully
impressed
with
the
importance
of
his
discovery
and
he
sent
to
the
assembled
princes
an
address
in
which
he
undertook
some
startling
performances
he
was
able
he
said
to
teach
young
or
old
hebrew
greek
and
latin
or
other
languages
in
a
very
short
time
and
without
any
difficulty
to
establish
schools
in
which
all
arts
should
be
taught
and
extended
to
introduce
and
peaceably
establish
throughout
the
german
empire
a
uniform
speech
a
uniform
government
and
still
more
wonderful
a
uniform
religion
naturally
enough
the
address
arrested
the
attention
of
the
princes
the
landgraf
lewis
of
darmstadt
thought
the
matter
worthy
of
examination
and
he
deputed
two
learned
men
jung
and
helwig
to
confer
with
ratke
their
report
was
entirely
favourable
and
they
did
all
they
could
to
get
for
ratke
the
means
of
carrying
his
scheme
into
execution
are
writes
helwig
bondage
to
latin
the
greeks
and
saracens
would
never
have
done
so
much
for
posterity
if
they
had
spent
their
youth
in
acquiring
a
foreign
tongue
we
must
study
our
own
language
and
then
sciences
ratichius
has
discovered
the
art
of
teaching
according
to
nature
by
his
method
languages
will
be
quickly
learned
so
that
we
shall
have
time
for
science
and
science
will
be
learned
even
better
still
as
the
natural
system
suits
best
with
science
which
is
the
study
of
moved
by
this
report
the
town
council
of
augsburg
agreed
to
give
ratke
the
necessary
power
over
their
schools
and
accompanied
by
helwig
he
accordingly
went
to
augsburg
and
set
to
work
but
the
good
folks
of
augsburg
were
like
children
who
expect
a
plant
as
soon
as
they
have
sown
the
seed
they
were
speedily
dissatisfied
and
ratke
and
helwig
left
augsburg
the
latter
much
discouraged
but
still
faithful
to
his
friend
ratke
went
to
frankfurt
again
and
a
commission
was
appointed
to
consider
his
proposals
but
by
its
advice
ratke
was
to
try
he
would
never
have
had
a
fair
chance
had
he
not
had
a
firm
friend
in
the
duchess
dorothy
of
weimar
then
as
now
we
find
women
taking
the
lead
in
everything
which
promises
to
improve
education
and
this
good
duchess
sent
for
ratke
and
tested
his
method
by
herself
taking
lessons
of
him
in
hebrew
with
this
adult
pupil
his
plans
seem
to
have
answered
well
and
she
always
continued
his
admirer
and
advocate
by
her
advice
her
brother
prince
lewis
of
decided
that
the
great
discovery
should
not
be
lost
for
want
of
a
fair
trial
so
he
called
ratke
to
koethen
and
complied
with
all
his
demands
a
band
of
teachers
sworn
to
secrecy
were
first
of
all
instructed
in
the
art
by
ratke
himself
next
schools
with
very
costly
appliances
were
provided
and
lastly
some
little
and
collected
and
handed
over
to
ratke
to
work
his
wonders
with
it
never
seems
to
have
occurred
either
to
ratke
or
his
friends
or
the
prince
that
all
the
principles
and
methods
that
ever
were
or
ever
will
be
established
could
not
enable
a
man
without
experience
to
organize
a
school
of
children
a
man
who
had
never
been
in
the
water
might
just
as
well
plunge
into
the
sea
at
once
and
trust
to
his
knowledge
of
the
laws
of
fluid
pressure
to
save
him
from
drowning
there
are
endless
details
to
be
settled
which
would
bewilder
any
one
without
experience
some
years
ago
were
provided
for
one
of
our
county
schools
and
the
council
consulted
a
master
of
great
experience
who
strongly
urged
them
not
to
start
as
they
had
intended
with
boys
would
not
undertake
such
a
thing
said
he
when
pressed
for
his
reason
he
said
quietly
would
not
be
responsible
for
the
i
have
no
doubt
ratke
had
to
come
down
from
his
principles
and
his
new
method
to
deal
with
numberless
little
questions
of
caps
bonnets
late
children
broken
windows
and
the
like
and
he
was
without
the
tact
and
the
experience
which
enable
many
ordinary
men
and
women
who
know
nothing
of
principles
to
settle
such
matters
satisfactorily
years
afterwards
there
was
another
thinker
much
more
profound
and
influential
than
ratke
who
was
quite
as
incompetent
to
organize
i
mean
pestalozzi
but
pestalozzi
had
one
great
advantage
over
ratke
he
attached
all
his
assistants
to
him
by
inspiring
them
with
love
and
reverence
of
himself
this
made
up
for
many
deficiencies
but
ratke
was
not
like
the
fatherly
pestalozzi
he
leads
us
to
suspect
him
of
being
an
impostor
by
making
a
mystery
of
his
invention
and
he
never
could
keep
the
peace
with
his
assistants
so
as
might
have
been
expected
the
grand
experiment
failed
the
prince
exasperated
at
being
placed
in
a
somewhat
ridiculous
position
and
possibly
at
the
serious
loss
of
money
into
the
bargain
revenged
himself
on
ratke
by
throwing
him
into
prison
nor
would
he
release
him
till
he
had
made
him
sign
a
paper
in
which
he
admitted
that
he
had
undertaken
more
than
he
was
able
to
fulfil
this
was
no
doubt
the
case
and
yet
ratke
had
done
more
for
the
prince
than
the
prince
for
ratke
in
koethen
had
been
opened
the
first
german
school
in
which
the
children
were
taught
to
make
a
study
of
the
german
language
ratke
never
recovered
from
his
failure
at
koethen
and
nothing
memorable
is
recorded
of
him
afterwards
he
died
in
much
was
written
by
ratke
much
has
been
written
about
him
and
those
who
wish
to
know
more
than
the
few
particulars
i
have
given
may
find
all
they
want
in
raumer
or
barnard
the
innovator
failed
in
gaining
the
applause
of
his
contemporaries
and
he
does
not
seem
to
stand
high
in
the
respect
of
posterity
but
he
was
a
pioneer
in
the
art
of
didactics
and
the
rules
which
raumer
has
gathered
from
the
institutionis
nova
ratichii
et
published
by
rhenius
at
leipzig
in
raise
some
of
the
most
interesting
points
to
which
a
teachers
attention
can
be
directed
i
will
therefore
state
them
and
say
briefly
what
i
think
of
them
i
everything
we
should
follow
the
order
of
nature
there
is
a
certain
natural
sequence
along
which
the
human
intelligence
moves
in
acquiring
knowledge
this
sequence
must
be
studied
and
instruction
must
be
based
on
the
knowledge
of
here
as
in
all
teaching
of
the
reformers
we
find
used
as
if
the
word
stood
for
some
definite
idea
from
the
time
of
the
stoics
we
have
been
exhorted
to
in
more
modern
times
the
demand
was
well
formulated
by
picus
of
mirandola
no
heed
what
thing
many
men
do
but
what
thing
the
law
of
what
thing
what
thing
lord
showeth
thee
to
be
trans
by
sir
thomas
more
quoted
in
seebohm
pope
always
happy
in
expression
but
not
always
clear
in
thought
talks
nature
still
divinely
bright
one
clear
unchanged
and
universal
on
i
but
as
harris
has
well
pointed
out
louis
school
report
with
this
word
writers
on
education
do
a
great
deal
of
juggling
some
times
they
use
it
for
the
external
world
including
in
it
growth
sometimes
they
make
it
stand
for
the
ideal
what
sense
does
ratke
attach
to
it
one
might
have
some
difficulty
in
determining
perhaps
the
best
meaning
we
can
nowadays
find
for
his
rule
is
ii
thing
at
a
master
one
subject
before
you
take
up
another
for
each
language
master
a
single
book
go
over
it
again
and
again
till
you
have
completely
made
it
your
own
in
its
crude
form
this
rule
could
not
be
carried
out
if
the
attempt
were
made
the
results
would
be
no
better
than
from
the
six
course
of
terence
under
ratke
it
is
all
to
go
on
hammering
away
at
one
thing
day
after
day
without
any
change
and
there
is
a
point
beyond
which
any
attempt
at
thoroughness
must
end
in
simple
stagnation
the
rule
then
would
have
two
fatal
drawbacks
it
would
lead
to
monotony
it
would
require
a
completeness
of
learning
which
to
the
young
would
be
impossible
but
in
these
days
no
one
follows
ratke
on
the
other
hand
concentration
in
study
is
often
neglected
and
our
afford
specimens
of
the
most
ingenious
mosaic
work
in
which
everything
has
a
place
but
in
so
small
a
quantity
that
the
learners
never
find
out
what
each
thing
really
is
school
subjects
are
like
the
clubs
of
the
eastern
tale
which
did
not
give
out
their
medicinal
properties
till
the
patient
got
warm
in
the
use
of
them
when
a
good
hold
on
a
subject
has
once
been
secured
short
study
with
considerable
intervals
between
may
suffice
to
keep
up
and
even
increase
the
knowledge
already
obtained
but
in
matters
of
any
difficulty
in
a
new
language
no
start
is
ever
made
without
allotting
to
it
much
more
than
two
or
three
hours
a
week
it
is
perhaps
a
mistake
to
suppose
that
if
a
good
deal
of
the
language
may
be
learnt
by
giving
it
ten
hours
a
week
twice
that
amount
might
be
acquired
in
twenty
hours
it
is
a
much
greater
mistake
if
we
think
that
of
the
amount
might
be
acquired
in
two
hours
iii
same
thing
should
be
repeated
over
and
over
this
is
like
the
mater
and
the
same
notion
was
well
developed
years
later
by
jacotot
by
application
of
this
rule
some
odd
results
were
produced
the
little
koetheners
were
drilled
for
german
in
a
book
of
the
bible
genesis
was
selected
and
then
for
latin
in
a
play
of
terence
unlike
many
this
precept
of
comes
more
and
more
into
favour
as
the
schoolmaster
increases
in
age
and
experience
but
we
must
be
careful
to
take
our
pupils
with
us
and
this
repeating
the
same
thing
over
and
over
may
seem
to
them
what
marking
time
would
seem
to
soldiers
who
wanted
to
march
even
more
than
the
last
rule
this
is
open
to
the
objections
that
monotony
is
deadening
and
perfect
attainment
of
anything
but
words
impossible
in
keeping
to
a
subject
then
we
must
not
rely
on
simple
repetition
the
rule
now
accepted
is
thus
stated
by
diesterweg
subject
of
instruction
should
be
viewed
from
as
many
sides
as
possible
and
as
varied
exercises
as
possible
should
be
set
on
one
and
the
same
the
art
of
the
master
is
shown
in
disguising
repetition
and
bringing
known
things
into
new
connection
so
that
they
may
partially
at
least
retain
their
freshness
iv
let
the
be
studied
and
teach
everything
through
the
so
that
the
learners
attention
may
not
be
diverted
to
the
we
saw
that
sturm
the
leading
schoolmaster
of
renascence
tried
to
suppress
the
and
substitute
latin
for
it
against
this
a
vigorous
protest
was
made
in
this
country
by
mulcaster
and
our
language
was
never
conquered
by
a
foreign
language
as
german
was
conquered
first
by
latin
and
then
by
french
but
have
always
had
the
share
of
attention
in
the
schoolroom
and
though
many
have
seen
and
milton
has
said
that
understanding
can
not
in
this
body
found
itself
but
on
sensible
things
this
truth
is
only
now
making
its
way
into
the
schoolroom
hitherto
the
foundation
has
hardly
been
laid
before
schoolmaster
has
stept
in
and
staid
the
building
by
confounding
the
protest
against
this
will
always
be
put
to
his
credit
in
the
history
of
education
without
young
should
not
be
beaten
to
make
them
learn
or
for
not
having
learnt
it
is
compulsion
and
stripes
that
set
young
people
against
studying
boys
are
often
beaten
for
not
having
learnt
but
they
would
have
learnt
had
they
been
well
taught
the
human
understanding
is
so
formed
that
it
has
pleasure
in
receiving
what
it
should
retain
and
this
pleasure
you
destroy
by
your
harshness
where
the
master
is
skilful
and
judicious
the
boys
will
take
to
him
and
to
their
lessons
folly
lurks
indeed
in
the
heart
of
the
child
and
must
be
driven
out
with
the
rod
but
not
by
the
here
at
least
there
is
nothing
original
in
precept
a
goodly
array
of
authorities
have
condemned
learning
this
array
extends
at
least
as
far
as
from
plato
to
bishop
dupanloup
the
case
of
the
mind
no
study
pursued
under
compulsion
remains
rooted
in
the
memory
says
plato
depends
says
dupanloup
what
the
teacher
induces
his
pupils
to
do
for
authority
is
not
ought
to
be
inseparable
from
respect
and
devotion
i
will
respect
human
liberty
in
the
smallest
as
far
as
i
have
observed
there
is
only
one
class
of
persons
whom
the
authorities
from
plato
to
dupanloup
have
failed
to
convince
and
that
is
the
schoolmasters
this
is
the
class
to
which
i
have
belonged
and
i
should
not
be
prepared
to
take
counsel
up
your
boys
in
their
studies
without
constraint
and
in
a
playful
at
the
same
time
i
see
the
importance
of
and
there
is
no
such
thing
as
upon
compulsion
you
can
no
more
hurry
thought
with
the
cane
than
you
can
hurry
a
snail
with
a
pin
so
without
interest
there
can
be
no
proper
learning
interest
must
be
in
latin
grammar
but
if
they
could
choose
their
own
occupation
the
boys
however
interested
in
their
work
would
probably
find
something
else
more
interesting
still
we
can
not
get
on
and
never
shall
without
the
vi
may
be
learnt
by
it
has
always
been
a
common
mistake
in
the
schoolroom
to
confound
the
power
of
running
along
a
sequence
of
sounds
with
a
mastery
of
the
thought
with
which
those
sounds
should
be
connected
but
as
i
have
remarked
elsewhere
note
the
two
things
though
different
are
not
opposed
too
much
is
likely
to
be
made
of
learning
by
heart
for
of
the
two
things
the
pupils
find
it
the
easier
and
the
teacher
the
more
easily
tested
we
may
however
guard
against
the
abuse
without
giving
up
the
use
vii
in
all
both
in
the
way
of
learning
and
in
the
books
and
the
rules
a
uniform
method
should
be
observed
says
ratke
the
right
plan
is
for
the
learner
to
acquire
familiar
knowledge
of
one
subject
or
part
of
a
subject
and
then
use
this
for
comparison
when
he
learns
beyond
it
if
the
same
method
of
learning
is
adopted
throughout
this
will
render
comparison
more
easy
and
more
striking
viii
thing
itself
should
come
first
then
whatever
explains
to
those
who
do
not
with
closed
eyes
cling
to
the
method
of
their
predecessors
this
rule
may
seem
founded
on
would
any
one
but
a
or
a
writer
of
school
books
ever
think
of
making
children
who
do
not
know
a
word
of
french
learn
about
the
french
accents
and
yet
what
ratke
said
years
ago
has
not
been
disproved
since
rei
priusquam
rem
ipsam
quaerere
prorsus
absonum
et
absurdum
esse
videtur
which
i
take
to
mean
the
learner
has
a
notion
of
the
thing
itself
it
is
folly
to
worry
him
about
its
accidents
or
even
its
properties
essential
or
modus
rei
ante
this
rule
of
warns
teachers
against
a
very
common
mistake
the
subject
is
in
full
view
and
they
make
the
most
minute
observations
on
it
but
these
things
can
not
be
seen
by
their
pupils
and
even
if
the
beginner
could
see
these
minutiæ
he
would
find
in
them
neither
interest
nor
advantage
but
when
we
apply
principle
more
widely
we
find
ourselves
involved
in
the
great
question
whether
our
method
should
be
based
on
synthesis
or
analysis
a
question
which
method
did
not
settle
for
us
ix
by
experience
and
examination
of
the
or
as
he
states
the
rule
in
latin
inductionem
et
experimentum
nothing
was
to
be
received
on
authority
and
this
disciple
of
bacon
went
beyond
his
master
and
took
for
his
motto
cessit
ratio
has
yielded
reason
as
if
reason
must
be
and
truth
might
wax
old
and
be
ready
to
vanish
away
from
these
rules
of
his
we
see
that
ratke
did
much
to
formulate
the
main
principles
of
didactics
he
also
deserves
to
be
remembered
among
the
methodizers
who
have
tackled
the
to
teach
a
language
at
köthen
the
instructor
of
the
lowest
class
had
to
talk
with
the
children
and
to
take
pains
with
their
pronunciation
when
they
knew
their
letters
plan
for
reading
ratke
seems
to
have
neglected
the
teacher
read
the
book
of
genesis
through
to
them
each
chapter
twice
over
requiring
the
children
to
follow
with
eye
and
finger
then
the
teacher
began
the
chapter
again
and
read
about
four
lines
only
which
the
children
read
after
him
when
the
book
had
been
worked
over
in
this
way
the
children
were
required
to
read
it
through
without
assistance
reading
once
secured
the
master
proceeded
to
grammar
he
explained
say
what
a
substantive
was
and
then
showed
instances
in
genesis
and
next
required
the
children
to
point
out
others
in
this
way
the
grammar
was
verified
throughout
from
genesis
and
the
pupils
were
exercised
in
declining
and
conjugating
words
taken
from
the
book
when
they
advanced
to
the
study
of
latin
they
were
given
a
of
a
play
of
terence
and
worked
over
it
several
times
before
they
were
shown
the
latin
the
master
then
translated
the
play
to
them
each
work
twice
over
at
the
next
reading
the
master
translated
the
first
and
the
boys
translated
the
same
piece
the
second
having
thus
got
through
the
play
they
began
again
and
only
the
boys
translated
after
this
there
was
a
course
of
grammar
which
was
applied
to
the
terence
as
the
grammar
of
the
had
been
to
genesis
finally
the
pupils
were
put
through
a
course
of
exercises
in
which
they
had
to
turn
into
latin
sentences
imitated
from
the
terence
and
differing
from
the
original
only
in
the
number
or
person
used
raumer
gives
other
particulars
and
quotes
largely
from
the
almost
unreadable
account
of
kromayer
one
of
followers
in
order
that
we
may
have
as
he
says
a
notion
of
the
tediousness
of
the
method
no
doubt
anyone
who
has
followed
me
hitherto
will
consider
that
this
point
has
been
brought
out
already
with
sufficient
distinctness
when
we
compare
method
with
we
find
several
points
of
agreement
ratke
would
begin
the
study
of
a
language
by
taking
a
model
book
and
working
through
it
with
the
pupil
a
great
many
times
ascham
did
the
same
each
lecture
according
to
his
plan
would
be
gone
over
dozen
times
at
the
both
construed
to
the
pupil
instead
of
requiring
him
to
make
out
the
sense
for
himself
both
ratke
and
ascham
taught
grammar
not
by
itself
but
in
connection
with
the
model
book
but
the
points
of
difference
are
still
more
striking
in
one
respect
plan
was
weak
it
gave
the
pupils
little
to
do
and
made
no
use
of
the
pen
was
better
in
this
and
also
as
a
training
in
accuracy
ascham
was
as
i
have
pointed
out
a
ratke
was
a
his
system
was
a
good
deal
like
that
which
had
great
vogue
in
the
early
part
of
this
century
as
the
from
the
first
the
language
was
to
be
laid
on
thick
in
the
belief
that
of
it
was
sure
to
the
impressions
would
be
slight
and
there
would
at
first
be
much
confusion
between
words
which
had
a
superficial
resemblance
but
accuracy
it
was
thought
would
come
in
time
the
contest
between
the
two
schools
of
thought
of
which
ascham
and
ratke
may
be
taken
as
representatives
has
continued
till
now
and
within
the
last
few
years
both
parties
have
made
great
advances
in
method
but
in
nothing
does
progress
seem
slower
than
in
education
and
the
plan
of
in
vogue
fifty
years
ago
was
inferior
to
the
methods
advocated
by
the
old
writers
comenius
one
of
the
most
hopeful
signs
of
the
improvement
of
education
is
the
rapid
advance
in
the
last
thirty
years
of
the
fame
of
comenius
and
the
growth
of
a
large
literature
about
the
man
and
his
ideas
years
ago
when
i
first
became
interested
in
him
his
name
was
hardly
known
beyond
germany
in
english
there
was
indeed
an
excellent
life
of
him
prefixed
to
a
translation
of
his
of
but
this
work
by
daniel
benham
london
had
not
then
and
has
not
now
anything
like
the
circulation
it
deserves
a
much
more
successful
book
has
been
professor
amos
cambridge
university
press
and
this
is
known
to
most
and
should
be
to
all
english
students
of
education
by
the
germans
and
french
comenius
is
now
recognised
as
the
man
who
first
treated
education
in
a
scientific
spirit
and
who
bequeathed
the
rudiments
of
a
science
to
later
ages
on
this
account
the
great
library
of
pedagogy
at
leipzig
has
been
named
in
his
honour
the
john
amos
komensky
or
comenius
the
son
of
a
miller
who
belonged
to
the
moravian
brethren
was
born
at
the
moravian
village
of
niwnic
in
of
his
early
life
we
know
nothing
but
what
he
himself
tells
us
in
the
following
passage
both
my
parents
while
i
was
yet
a
child
i
began
through
the
neglect
of
my
guardians
but
at
sixteen
years
of
age
to
taste
of
the
latin
tongue
yet
by
the
goodness
of
god
that
taste
bred
such
a
thirst
in
me
that
i
ceased
not
from
that
time
by
all
means
and
endeavours
to
labour
for
the
repairing
of
my
lost
years
and
now
not
only
for
myself
but
for
the
good
of
others
also
for
i
could
not
but
pity
others
also
in
this
respect
especially
in
my
own
nation
which
is
too
slothful
and
careless
in
matter
of
learning
thereupon
i
was
continually
full
of
thoughts
for
the
finding
out
of
some
means
whereby
more
might
be
inflamed
with
the
love
of
learning
and
whereby
learning
itself
might
be
made
more
compendious
both
in
matter
of
the
charge
and
cost
and
of
the
labour
belonging
thereto
that
so
the
youth
might
be
brought
by
a
more
easy
method
unto
some
notable
proficiency
in
with
these
thoughts
in
his
head
he
pursued
his
studies
in
several
german
towns
especially
at
herborn
in
nassau
here
he
saw
the
report
on
method
published
in
for
the
universities
of
jena
and
giessen
and
we
find
him
shortly
afterwards
writing
his
first
book
facilioris
which
was
published
at
prag
in
on
his
return
to
moravia
he
was
appointed
to
the
school
at
prerau
but
to
use
his
own
words
shortly
after
at
the
age
of
called
to
the
service
of
the
church
because
divine
challenged
all
my
endeavours
divinumque
hoc
age
præ
oculis
erat
these
scholastic
cares
were
laid
his
pastoral
charge
was
at
fulneck
the
headquarters
of
the
brethren
as
such
it
soon
felt
the
effects
of
the
battle
of
prag
being
in
the
following
year
taken
and
plundered
by
the
spaniards
on
this
occasion
comenius
lost
his
mss
and
almost
everything
he
possessed
the
year
after
his
wife
died
and
then
his
only
child
in
all
protestant
ministers
were
banished
and
in
a
new
decree
extended
the
banishment
to
protestants
of
every
description
comenius
bore
up
against
wave
after
wave
of
calamity
with
christian
courage
and
resignation
and
his
writings
at
this
period
were
of
great
value
to
his
for
a
time
he
found
a
in
the
family
of
a
bohemian
nobleman
baron
sadowsky
at
slaupna
in
the
bohemian
mountains
and
in
this
retirement
his
attention
was
again
directed
to
the
science
of
teaching
the
baron
had
engaged
stadius
one
of
the
proscribed
to
educate
his
three
sons
and
at
request
comenius
wrote
canons
of
a
better
method
for
his
use
we
find
him
too
endeavouring
to
enrich
the
literature
of
his
making
a
metrical
translation
of
the
psalms
of
david
and
even
writing
imitations
of
virgil
ovid
and
in
however
the
persecution
waxed
so
hot
that
comenius
with
most
of
the
brethren
had
to
flee
their
country
never
to
return
on
crossing
the
border
comenius
and
the
exiles
who
accompanied
him
knelt
down
and
prayed
that
god
would
not
suffer
his
truth
to
fail
out
of
their
native
land
comenius
had
now
as
michelet
says
lost
his
country
and
found
his
country
which
was
the
world
many
of
the
banished
and
comenius
among
them
settled
at
the
polish
town
of
leszna
or
as
the
germans
call
it
lissa
near
the
silesian
frontier
here
there
was
an
school
of
the
brethren
in
which
comenius
found
employment
once
more
engaged
in
education
he
earnestly
set
about
improving
the
traditional
methods
as
he
himself
says
by
permission
banished
my
country
with
divers
others
and
forced
for
my
sustenance
to
apply
myself
to
the
instruction
of
youth
i
gave
my
mind
to
the
perusal
of
divers
authors
and
lighted
upon
many
which
in
this
age
have
made
a
beginning
in
reforming
the
method
of
studies
as
ratichius
helvicus
rhenius
ritterus
glaumius
cæcilius
and
who
indeed
should
have
had
the
first
place
joannes
valentinus
andreæ
a
man
of
a
nimble
and
clear
brain
as
also
campanella
and
the
lord
verulam
those
famous
restorers
of
philosophy
reading
of
whom
i
was
raised
in
good
hope
that
at
last
those
so
many
various
sparks
would
conspire
into
a
flame
yet
observing
here
and
there
some
defects
and
gaps
as
it
were
i
could
not
contain
myself
from
attempting
something
that
might
rest
upon
an
immovable
foundation
and
which
if
it
could
be
once
found
out
should
not
be
subject
to
any
ruin
therefore
after
many
workings
and
tossings
of
my
thoughts
by
reducing
everything
to
the
immovable
laws
of
nature
i
lighted
upon
my
which
shows
the
art
of
readily
and
solidly
teaching
all
men
all
this
work
did
not
immediately
see
the
light
but
in
comenius
published
a
book
which
made
him
and
the
little
polish
town
where
he
lived
known
throughout
europe
and
beyond
it
this
was
the
linguarum
or
of
tongues
writing
about
it
many
years
afterwards
he
says
that
he
never
could
have
imagined
that
that
little
work
fitted
only
for
children
istud
would
have
been
received
with
applause
by
all
the
learned
world
letters
of
congratulation
came
to
him
from
every
quarter
and
the
work
was
translated
not
only
into
greek
bohemian
polish
swedish
belgian
english
french
spanish
italian
hungarian
but
also
into
turkish
arabic
persian
and
even

dedication
of
in

of

works
incited
by
the
applause
of
the
learned
comenius
now
planned
a
scheme
of
universal
knowledge
to
impart
which
a
series
of
works
would
have
to
be
written
far
exceeding
what
the
resources
and
industry
of
one
man
however
great
a
scholar
could
produce
he
therefore
looked
about
for
a
patron
to
supply
money
for
the
support
of
himself
and
his
assistants
whilst
these
works
were
in
progress
vastness
of
the
labours
i
contemplate
he
writes
to
a
polish
nobleman
that
i
should
have
a
wealthy
patron
whether
we
look
at
their
extent
or
at
the
necessity
of
securing
assistants
or
at
the
expenses
at
leszna
there
seemed
no
prospect
of
his
obtaining
the
aid
he
required
but
his
fame
now
procured
him
invitations
from
distant
countries
first
he
received
a
call
to
improve
the
schools
of
sweden
after
declining
this
he
was
induced
by
his
english
friends
to
undertake
a
journey
to
london
where
parliament
had
shown
its
interest
in
the
matter
of
education
and
had
employed
hartlib
an
enthusiastic
admirer
of
comenius
to
attempt
a
reform
probably
through
his
family
connections
hartlib
was
on
intimate
terms
with
comenius
and
he
had
much
influence
on
his
career
it
would
seem
that
comenius
though
never
tired
of
forming
magnificent
schemes
hung
back
from
putting
anything
into
a
definite
shape
after
the
appearance
of
the
linguarum
he
planned
a
and
even
allowed
that
title
to
appear
in
list
of
new
books
to
come
forth
at
the
next
mart
at
but
again
he
hesitated
and
withdrew
the
announcement
here
hartlib
came
in
and
forced
him
into
print
without
his
intending
or
even
knowing
it
meam

preface
to
pansophicorum
hartlib
begged
of
comenius
a
sketch
of
his
great
scheme
and
with
apologies
to
the
author
for
not
awaiting
his
consent
he
published
it
at
oxford
in
under
the
title
of
comenianorum
comenius
accepted
the
with
the
best
grace
he
at
the
stir
the
book
made
in
the
learned
world
but
galled
by
criticisms
especially
by
doubts
of
his
orthodoxy
to
refute
the
cavillers
he
wrote
a
tract
called
pansophicorum
which
was
published
in
in
hartlib
issued
in
london
a
new
duodecimo
edition
of
the
or
as
he
then
called
it
and
the
adding
a
dissertation
by
comenius
on
the
study
of
latin
now
when
everything
seemed
ripe
for
a
change
in
education
and
comenius
himself
was
on
his
way
to
england
hartlib
translated
the
and
when
comenius
had
come
he
published
it
with
the
title
reformation
of
it
was
no
doubt
by
influence
that
parliament
had
been
led
to
summon
comenius
and
at
any
other
time
the
visit
might
have
been
occasion
of
great
good
to
this
island
but
arma
silent
and
comenius
went
away
again
this
is
the
account
he
himself
has
left
us
seriously
proposing
to
abandon
the
thorny
studies
of
didactics
and
pass
on
to
the
pleasing
studies
of
philosophical
truth
i
find
myself
again
among
the
same
thorns
after
the
had
been
published
and
dispersed
through
various
kingdoms
of
europe
many
of
the
learned
approved
of
the
object
and
plan
of
the
work
but
despaired
of
its
ever
being
accomplished
by
one
man
alone
and
therefore
advised
that
a
college
of
learned
men
should
be
instituted
to
carry
it
into
effect
hartlib
who
had
forwarded
the
publication
of
the
in
england
laboured
earnestly
in
this
matter
and
endeavoured
by
every
possible
means
to
bring
together
for
this
purpose
a
number
of
men
of
intellectual
activity
and
at
length
having
found
one
or
two
he
invited
me
also
with
many
very
strong
entreaties
my
people
having
consented
to
the
journey
i
came
to
london
on
the
very
day
of
the
autumnal
equinox
september
and
there
at
last
learnt
that
i
had
been
invited
by
the
order
of
the
parliament
but
as
the
parliament
the
king
having
then
gone
to
scotland
august
was
dismissed
for
a
three
recess
not
quite
three
months
but
from
september
to
october
i
was
detained
there
through
the
winter
my
friends
mustering
what
pansophic
apparatus
they
could
though
it
was
but
slender
the
parliament
meanwhile
having
re
assembled
and
our
presence
being
known
i
had
orders
to
wait
until
they
should
have
sufficient
leisure
from
other
business
to
appoint
a
commission
of
learned
and
wise
men
from
their
body
for
hearing
us
and
considering
the
grounds
of
our
design
they
communicated
also
beforehand
their
thoughts
of
assigning
to
us
some
college
with
its
revenues
whereby
a
certain
number
of
learned
and
industrious
men
called
from
all
nations
might
be
honourably
maintained
either
for
a
term
of
years
or
in
perpetuity
there
was
even
named
for
the
purpose
in
london
out
of
london
was
named
and
again
nearer
the
city
inventories
of
which
and
of
its
revenues
were
communicated
to
us
so
that
nothing
seemed
more
certain
than
that
the
design
of
the
great
verulam
concerning
the
opening
somewhere
of
a
universal
college
devoted
to
the
advancement
of
the
sciences
could
be
carried
out
but
the
rumour
of
the
insurrection
in
ireland
and
of
the
massacre
in
one
night
of
more
than
english
october
november
and
the
sudden
departure
of
the
king
from
london
january
and
the
plentiful
signs
of
the
bloody
war
about
to
break
out
disturbed
these
plans
and
obliged
me
to
hasten
my
return
to
my
own
while
comenius
was
in
england
where
he
stayed
till
august
he
received
an
invitation
to
france
this
invitation
which
he
did
not
accept
came
perhaps
through
his
correspondent
mersenne
a
man
of
great
learning
who
is
said
to
have
been
highly
esteemed
and
often
consulted
by
descartes
it
is
characteristic
of
the
state
of
opinion
in
such
matters
in
those
days
that
mersenne
tells
comenius
of
a
certain
le
maire
by
whose
method
a
boy
of
six
years
old
might
with
nine
instruction
acquire
a
perfect
knowledge
of
three
languages
mersenne
also
had
dreams
of
a
universal
alphabet
and
even
of
a
universal
language
hopes
of
assistance
in
england
being
at
an
end
he
thought
of
returning
to
leszna
but
a
letter
now
reached
him
from
a
rich
dutch
merchant
lewis
de
geer
who
offered
him
a
home
and
means
for
carrying
out
his
plans
this
lewis
de
geer
grand
almoner
of
europe
as
comenius
calls
him
displayed
a
princely
munificence
in
the
assistance
he
gave
the
exiled
protestants
at
this
time
he
was
living
at
nordcoping
in
sweden
comenius
having
now
found
such
a
patron
as
he
was
seeking
set
out
from
england
and
joined
him
there
soon
after
the
arrival
of
comenius
in
sweden
the
great
oxenstiern
sent
for
him
to
stockholm
and
with
john
skyte
the
chancellor
of
upsal
university
examined
him
and
his
system
two
as
comenius
says
me
in
colloquy
for
four
days
and
chiefly
the
most
illustrious
oxenstiern
that
eagle
of
the
north
he
inquired
into
the
foundations
of
both
my
schemes
the
didactic
and
the
pansophic
so
searchingly
that
it
was
unlike
anything
that
had
been
done
before
by
any
of
my
learned
critics
in
the
first
two
days
he
examined
the
didactics
and
finally
said
an
early
age
i
perceived
that
our
method
of
studies
generally
in
use
is
a
harsh
and
crude
one
but
where
the
thing
stuck
i
could
not
find
out
at
length
having
been
sent
by
my
king
of
glorious
memory
by
gustavus
adolphus
as
ambassador
into
germany
i
conversed
on
the
subject
with
various
learned
men
and
when
i
had
heard
that
wolfgang
ratichius
was
toiling
at
an
amended
method
i
had
no
rest
of
mind
till
i
had
him
before
me
but
instead
of
talking
on
the
subject
he
put
into
my
hands
a
big
quarto
volume
i
swallowed
this
trouble
and
having
turned
over
the
whole
book
i
saw
that
he
had
detected
well
enough
the
maladies
of
our
schools
but
the
remedies
he
proposed
did
not
seem
to
me
sufficient
yours
comenius
rest
on
firmer
foundations
go
on
with
the
i
answered
that
i
had
done
all
i
could
in
those
matters
and
must
now
go
on
to
others
know
said
he
you
are
toiling
at
greater
affairs
for
i
have
read
your
that
we
will
discuss
i
must
now
to
public
next
day
he
began
on
my
pansophic
attempts
and
examined
them
with
still
greater
severity
you
a
man
he
asked
can
bear
contradiction
can
said
i
for
that
reason
my
or
preliminary
sketch
was
sent
out
first
not
indeed
that
i
sent
it
out
myself
this
was
done
by
friends
that
it
might
meet
with
criticism
and
if
we
seek
the
criticism
of
all
and
sundry
how
much
more
from
men
of
mature
wisdom
and
heroic
reason
he
began
accordingly
to
discourse
against
the
hope
of
a
better
state
of
things
arising
from
a
rightly
instituted
study
of
pansophia
first
objecting
political
reasons
then
what
was
said
in
scripture
about
last
all
which
objections
i
so
answered
that
he
ended
with
these
words
no
mind
do
i
think
such
things
have
come
before
stand
upon
these
grounds
of
yours
so
shall
we
some
time
come
to
agreement
or
there
will
be
no
way
left
my
advice
however
added
he
that
you
first
do
something
for
the
schools
and
bring
the
study
of
the
latin
tongue
to
a
greater
facility
thus
you
will
prepare
the
way
for
those
greater
as
skyte
and
afterwards
de
geer
gave
the
same
advice
comenius
felt
himself
constrained
to
follow
it
so
he
agreed
to
settle
at
elbing
in
prussia
and
there
write
a
work
on
teaching
in
which
the
principles
of
the
should
be
worked
out
with
especial
reference
to
teaching
languages
notwithstanding
the
remonstrances
of
his
english
friends
to
which
comenius
would
gladly
have
listened
he
was
kept
by
oxenstiern
and
de
geer
strictly
to
his
agreement
and
thus
much
against
his
will
he
was
held
fast
for
eight
years
in
what
he
calls
the
entanglements
of
elbing
where
after
a
journey
to
leszna
to
fetch
his
family
for
he
had
married
again
comenius
now
settled
is
in
west
prussia
miles
of
dantzic
from
to
an
english
trading
company
was
settled
here
with
which
the
family
of
hartlib
was
connected
this
perhaps
was
one
reason
why
comenius
chose
this
town
for
his
residence
but
although
he
had
a
grant
of
a
year
from
parliament
hartlib
instead
of
assisting
with
money
seems
at
this
time
to
have
himself
needed
assistance
for
in
october
comenius
writes
to
de
geer
that
he
fears
fundanius
and
hartlib
are
suffering
from
want
and
that
he
intends
for
them
promised
by
the
london
booksellers
he
suggests
that
de
geer
shall
give
them
each
meanwhile
benham
p
the
relation
between
comenius
and
his
patron
naturally
proved
a
difficult
one
the
dutchman
thought
that
as
he
supported
comenius
and
contributed
something
more
for
the
assistants
he
might
expect
of
comenius
that
he
would
devote
all
his
time
to
the
scholastic
treatise
he
had
undertaken
comenius
however
was
a
man
of
immense
energy
and
of
widely
extended
sympathies
and
connections
he
was
a
of
the
religious
body
to
which
he
belonged
and
in
this
capacity
he
engaged
in
controversy
and
attended
some
religious
conferences
then
again
pupils
were
pressed
upon
him
and
as
money
to
pay
five
writers
whom
he
kept
at
work
was
always
running
short
he
did
not
decline
them
de
geer
complained
of
this
and
supplies
were
not
furnished
with
wonted
regularity
in
comenius
writes
to
hartlib
that
he
is
almost
overwhelmed
with
cares
and
sick
to
death
of
writing
yet
in
this
year
he
found
means
to
publish
a
book
the
causes
of
the
thirty
years
in
which
the
roman
catholics
are
attacked
with
great
bitterness
for
which
the
position
of
the
writer
affords
too
good
an
excuse
the
year
brought
with
it
the
downfall
of
all
hopes
of
returning
to
his
native
land
the
peace
of
westphalia
was
concluded
without
any
provision
being
made
for
the
restoration
of
the
exiles
but
though
thus
doomed
to
pass
the
remaining
years
of
his
life
in
banishment
comenius
in
this
year
seemed
to
have
found
an
escape
from
all
his
pecuniary
difficulties
the
senior
bishop
the
head
of
the
moravian
brethren
died
and
comenius
was
chosen
to
succeed
him
in
consequence
of
this
comenius
returned
to
leszna
where
due
provision
was
made
for
him
by
the
brethren
before
he
left
elbing
however
the
fruit
of
his
residence
there
the
linguarum
had
been
submitted
to
a
commission
of
learned
swedes
and
approved
of
by
them
the
went
with
him
to
leszna
where
it
was
published
as
head
of
the
moravian
church
there
now
devolved
upon
comenius
the
care
of
all
the
exiles
and
his
widespread
reputation
enabled
him
to
get
situations
for
many
of
them
in
all
protestant
countries
but
he
was
now
so
much
connected
with
the
science
of
education
that
even
his
post
at
leszna
did
not
prevent
his
receiving
and
accepting
a
call
to
reform
the
schools
in
transylvania
a
model
school
was
formed
at
where
there
was
a
settlement
of
the
banished
brethren
and
in
this
school
comenius
laboured
from
till
at
this
time
he
wrote
his
most
celebrated
book
which
is
indeed
only
an
abridgment
of
his
with
the
important
addition
of
pictures
and
sent
it
to
nürnberg
where
it
appeared
three
years
later
this
was
the
famous
full
of
trouble
as
life
had
hitherto
been
its
greatest
calamity
was
still
before
him
after
he
was
again
settled
at
leszna
poland
was
invaded
by
the
swedes
on
which
occasion
the
sympathies
of
the
brethren
were
with
their
and
comenius
was
imprudent
enough
to
write
a
congratulatory
address
to
the
swedish
king
a
peace
followed
by
the
terms
of
which
several
towns
and
leszna
among
them
were
made
over
to
sweden
but
when
the
king
withdrew
the
poles
took
up
arms
again
and
leszna
the
headquarters
of
the
protestants
the
town
in
which
the
chief
of
the
moravian
brethren
had
written
his
address
welcoming
the
enemy
was
taken
and
plundered
comenius
and
his
family
escaped
but
his
house
was
marked
for
special
violence
and
nothing
was
preserved
his
sole
remaining
possessions
were
the
clothes
in
which
he
and
his
family
travelled
all
his
books
and
manuscripts
were
burnt
among
them
his
valued
work
on
pansophia
and
a
and
dictionary
giving
words
phrases
idioms
adages
and
book
on
which
he
had
been
labouring
for
forty
years
loss
he
writes
shall
cease
to
lament
only
when
i
cease
to
after
wandering
for
some
time
about
germany
and
being
prostrated
by
fever
at
hamburg
he
at
length
came
to
amsterdam
where
lawrence
de
geer
the
son
of
his
deceased
patron
gave
him
an
asylum
here
were
spent
the
remaining
years
of
his
life
in
ease
and
dignity
compassion
for
his
misfortunes
was
united
with
veneration
for
his
learning
and
piety
he
earned
a
sufficient
income
by
giving
instruction
in
the
families
of
the
wealthy
and
by
the
liberality
of
de
geer
he
was
enabled
to
publish
a
fine
folio
edition
of
all
his
writings
on
education
his
political
works
however
were
to
the
last
a
source
of
trouble
to
him
his
hostility
to
the
pope
and
the
house
of
hapsburg
made
him
the
dupe
of
certain
whose
soothsayings
he
published
as
in
one
of
these
prophets
who
had
announced
that
the
turk
was
to
take
vienna
was
executed
at
pressburg
and
the
in
at
the
same
time
burnt
by
the
hangman
before
the
news
of
this
disgrace
reached
amsterdam
comenius
was
no
more
he
died
in
the
year
at
the
advanced
age
of
eighty
and
with
him
terminated
the
office
of
chief
bishop
among
the
moravian
brethren
his
long
life
had
been
full
of
trouble
and
he
saw
little
of
the
improvements
he
so
earnestly
desired
and
laboured
after
but
he
continued
the
struggle
hopefully
to
the
end
in
his
year
he
wrote
these
memorable
words
thank
god
that
i
have
all
my
life
been
a
man
of
aspirations
for
the
longing
after
good
however
it
spring
up
in
the
heart
is
always
a
rill
flowing
from
the
fountain
of
all
labouring
in
this
spirit
he
did
not
toil
in
vain
and
the
historians
of
education
have
agreed
in
ranking
him
among
the
most
influential
as
well
as
the
most
of
the
reformers
before
comenius
no
one
had
brought
the
mind
of
a
philosopher
to
bear
practically
on
the
subject
of
education
montaigne
and
bacon
had
advanced
principles
leaving
others
to
see
to
their
application
a
few
able
schoolmasters
ascham
had
investigated
new
methods
but
had
made
success
in
teaching
the
test
to
which
they
appealed
rather
than
any
abstract
principle
comenius
was
at
once
a
philosopher
who
had
learnt
of
bacon
and
a
schoolmaster
who
had
earned
his
livelihood
by
teaching
the
rudiments
dissatisfied
with
the
state
of
education
as
he
found
it
he
sought
for
a
better
system
by
an
examination
of
the
laws
of
nature
whatever
is
thus
established
is
indeed
on
an
immovable
foundation
and
as
comenius
himself
says
liable
to
any
it
will
hardly
be
disputed
when
broadly
stated
that
there
are
laws
of
nature
which
must
be
obeyed
in
dealing
with
the
mind
as
with
the
body
no
doubt
these
laws
are
not
so
easily
established
in
the
first
case
as
in
the
second
nor
can
we
find
them
without
much
and
some
mistakes
but
whoever
in
any
way
assists
or
even
tries
to
assist
in
the
discovery
deserves
our
gratitude
and
greatly
are
we
indebted
to
him
who
first
boldly
set
about
the
task
and
devoted
to
it
years
of
patient
labour
comenius
has
left
voluminous
latin
writings
professor
laurie
gives
us
the
titles
of
the
books
connected
with
education
and
they
are
in
number
so
there
must
be
much
repetition
and
indeed
retractation
for
comenius
was
always
learning
and
one
of
his
last
books
was
sapientiæ
sive
sapienter
sua
retractandi
or
the
art
of
wisely
withdrawing
own
we
owe
much
to
professor
laurie
who
has
served
as
a
and
left
us
a
succinct
and
clear
account
of
the
teaching
i
have
read
little
of
the
writings
of
comenius
except
the
german
translation
of
the
didactic
from
which
the
following
is
taken
we
live
says
comenius
a
threefold
vegetative
an
animal
and
an
intellectual
or
spiritual
of
these
the
first
is
perfect
in
the
womb
the
last
in
heaven
he
is
happy
who
comes
with
healthy
body
into
the
world
much
more
he
who
goes
with
healthy
spirit
out
of
it
according
to
the
heavenly
idea
man
should
know
all
things
should
be
master
of
all
things
and
of
himself
should
refer
everything
to
god
so
that
within
us
nature
has
implanted
the
seeds
of
learning
virtue
and
piety
to
bring
these
seeds
to
maturity
is
the
object
of
education
all
men
require
education
and
god
has
made
children
unfit
for
other
employments
that
they
may
have
leisure
to
learn
but
schools
have
failed
and
instead
of
keeping
to
the
true
object
of
education
and
teaching
the
foundations
relations
and
intentions
of
all
the
most
important
things
they
have
neglected
even
the
mother
tongue
and
confined
the
teaching
to
latin
and
yet
that
has
been
so
badly
taught
and
so
much
time
has
been
wasted
over
grammar
rules
and
dictionaries
that
from
ten
to
twenty
years
are
spent
in
acquiring
as
much
knowledge
of
latin
as
is
speedily
acquired
of
any
modern
tongue
the
cause
of
this
want
of
success
is
that
the
system
does
not
follow
nature
everything
natural
goes
smoothly
and
easily
there
must
therefore
be
no
pressure
learning
should
come
to
children
as
swimming
to
fish
flying
to
birds
running
to
animals
as
aristotle
says
the
desire
of
knowledge
is
implanted
in
man
and
the
mind
grows
as
the
body
taking
proper
nourishment
not
by
being
stretched
on
the
rack
if
we
would
ascertain
how
teaching
and
learning
are
to
have
good
results
we
must
look
to
the
known
processes
of
nature
and
art
a
man
sows
seed
and
it
comes
up
he
knows
not
how
but
in
sowing
it
he
must
attend
to
the
requirements
of
nature
let
us
then
look
to
nature
to
find
out
how
knowledge
takes
root
in
young
minds
we
find
that
nature
waits
for
the
fit
time
then
too
she
has
prepared
the
material
before
she
gives
it
form
in
our
teaching
we
constantly
run
counter
to
these
principles
of
hers
we
give
instruction
before
the
young
minds
are
ready
to
receive
it
we
give
the
form
before
the
material
words
are
taught
before
the
things
to
which
they
refer
when
a
foreign
tongue
is
to
be
taught
we
commonly
give
the
form
the
grammatical
rules
before
we
give
the
material
the
language
to
which
the
rules
apply
we
should
begin
with
an
author
or
properly
prepared
and
abstract
rules
should
never
come
before
the
examples
again
nature
begins
each
of
her
works
with
its
inmost
part
moreover
the
crude
form
comes
first
then
the
elaboration
of
the
parts
the
architect
acting
on
this
principle
first
makes
a
rough
plan
or
model
and
then
by
degrees
designs
the
details
last
of
all
he
attends
to
the
ornamentation
in
teaching
then
let
the
inmost
part
the
understanding
of
the
subject
come
first
then
let
the
thing
understood
be
used
to
exercise
the
memory
the
speech
and
the
hands
and
let
every
language
science
and
art
be
taught
first
in
its
rudimentary
outline
then
more
completely
with
examples
and
rules
finally
with
exceptions
and
anomalies
instead
of
this
some
teachers
are
foolish
enough
to
require
beginners
to
get
up
all
the
anomalies
in
latin
grammar
and
the
dialects
in
greek
again
as
nature
does
nothing
nor
halts
when
she
has
begun
the
whole
course
of
studies
should
be
arranged
in
strict
order
so
that
the
earlier
studies
prepare
the
way
for
the
later
every
year
every
month
every
day
and
hour
even
should
have
its
task
marked
out
beforehand
and
the
plan
should
be
rigidly
carried
out
much
loss
is
occasioned
by
absence
of
boys
from
school
and
by
changes
in
the
instruction
iron
that
might
be
wrought
with
one
heating
should
not
be
allowed
to
get
cold
and
be
heated
over
and
over
again
nature
protects
her
work
from
injurious
influences
so
boys
should
be
kept
from
injurious
companionships
and
books
in
a
chapter
devoted
to
the
principles
of
easy
teaching
comenius
lays
down
among
rules
similar
to
the
foregoing
that
children
will
learn
if
they
are
taught
only
what
they
have
a
desire
to
learn
with
due
regard
to
their
age
and
the
method
of
instruction
and
especially
when
everything
is
first
taught
by
means
of
the
senses
on
this
point
comenius
laid
great
stress
and
he
was
the
first
who
did
so
education
should
proceed
he
said
in
the
following
order
first
educate
the
senses
then
the
memory
then
the
intellect
last
of
all
the
critical
faculty
this
is
the
order
of
nature
the
child
first
perceives
through
the
senses
est
in
intellectu
quod
non
prius
fuerit
in
everything
in
the
intellect
must
have
come
through
the
these
perceptions
are
stored
in
the
memory
and
called
up
by
the
imagination
by
comparing
one
with
another
the
understanding
forms
general
ideas
and
at
length
the
judgment
decides
between
the
false
and
the
true
by
keeping
to
this
order
comenius
believed
it
would
be
possible
to
make
learning
entirely
pleasant
to
the
pupils
however
young
here
comenius
went
even
further
than
the
jesuits
they
wished
to
make
learning
pleasant
but
despaired
of
doing
this
except
by
external
influences
emulation
and
the
like
comenius
did
not
neglect
external
means
to
make
the
road
to
learning
agreeable
like
the
jesuits
he
would
have
short
and
would
make
great
use
of
praise
and
blame
but
he
did
not
depend
as
they
did
almost
exclusively
on
emulation
he
would
have
the
desire
of
learning
fostered
in
every
possible
parents
by
teachers
by
school
buildings
and
apparatus
by
the
subjects
themselves
by
the
method
of
teaching
them
and
lastly
by
the
public
authorities
the
parents
must
praise
learning
and
learned
men
must
show
children
beautiful
books
must
treat
the
teachers
with
great
respect
the
teacher
must
be
kind
and
fatherly
he
must
distribute
praise
and
reward
and
must
always
where
it
is
possible
give
the
children
something
to
look
at
the
school
buildings
must
be
light
airy
and
cheerful
and
well
furnished
with
apparatus
as
pictures
maps
models
collections
of
specimens
the
subjects
taught
must
not
be
too
hard
for
the
comprehension
and
the
more
entertaining
parts
of
them
must
be
especially
dwelt
upon
the
method
must
be
natural
and
everything
that
is
not
essential
to
the
subject
or
is
beyond
the
pupil
must
be
omitted
fables
and
allegories
should
be
introduced
and
enigmas
given
for
the
pupils
to
guess
the
authorities
must
appoint
public
examinations
and
reward
merit
nature
helps
herself
in
various
ways
so
the
pupils
should
have
every
assistance
given
them
it
should
especially
be
made
clear
what
the
pupils
are
to
learn
and
how
they
should
learn
it
the
pupils
should
be
punished
for
offences
against
morals
only
if
they
do
not
learn
the
fault
is
with
the
teacher
one
of
most
distinctive
principles
was
that
there
should
no
longer
be
divortium
rerum
et
the
wretched
divorce
of
words
from
the
phrase
i
think
is
but
that
knowledge
of
and
words
should
go
together
this
together
with
his
desire
of
submitting
everything
to
the
senses
would
have
introduced
a
great
change
into
the
course
of
instruction
which
was
then
as
it
has
for
the
most
part
continued
purely
literary
we
should
learn
says
comenius
as
much
as
possible
not
from
books
but
from
the
great
book
of
nature
from
heaven
and
earth
from
oaks
and
beeches
when
languages
are
to
be
learnt
he
would
have
them
taught
separately
till
the
pupil
is
from
eight
to
ten
years
old
he
should
be
instructed
only
in
the
and
about
things
then
other
languages
can
be
acquired
in
about
a
year
each
latin
which
is
to
be
studied
more
thoroughly
in
about
two
years
every
language
must
be
learnt
by
use
rather
than
by
rules
it
must
be
learnt
by
hearing
reading
and
transcribing
attempting
imitations
in
writing
and
orally
and
by
using
the
language
in
conversation
rules
assist
and
confirm
practice
but
they
must
come
after
not
before
it
the
first
exercises
in
a
language
should
take
for
their
subject
something
of
which
the
sense
is
already
known
so
that
the
mind
may
be
fixed
on
the
words
and
their
connections
the
catechism
and
bible
history
may
be
used
for
this
purpose
considering
the
classical
authors
not
suited
to
understanding
and
not
fit
for
the
education
of
christians
comenius
proposed
writing
a
set
of
latin
manuals
for
the
different
stages
between
childhood
and
manhood
these
were
to
be
called
or
the
and
were
really
carried
out
in
scheme
there
were
to
be
four
kinds
of
schools
for
a
perfect
educational
course
the
breast
for
infancy
the
public
vernacular
school
for
children
to
which
all
should
be
sent
from
six
years
old
till
twelve
the
latin
school
or
gymnasium
residence
at
a
university
and
travelling
to
complete
the
course
the
public
schools
were
to
be
for
all
classes
alike
and
for
girls
as
well
as
boys
most
boys
and
girls
in
every
community
would
stop
at
the
vernacular
school
and
as
this
school
is
a
very
distinctive
feature
in
plan
it
may
be
worth
while
to
give
his
programme
of
studies
in
this
school
the
children
should
to
read
and
write
the
both
with
writing
and
printing
letters
to
compose
grammatically
to
cipher
to
measure
and
weigh
to
sing
at
first
popular
airs
then
from
music
to
say
by
heart
sacred
psalms
and
hymns
catechism
bible
history
and
texts
moral
rules
with
examples
economics
and
politics
as
far
as
they
could
be
understood
general
history
of
the
world
figure
of
the
earth
and
motion
of
stars
physics
and
geography
especially
of
native
land
general
knowledge
of
arts
and
handicrafts
each
school
was
to
be
divided
into
six
classes
corresponding
to
the
six
years
the
pupil
should
spend
in
it
the
hours
of
work
were
to
be
in
school
two
hours
in
the
morning
and
two
in
the
afternoon
with
nearly
the
same
amount
of
private
study
in
the
morning
the
mind
and
memory
were
to
be
exercised
in
the
afternoon
the
hands
and
voice
each
class
was
to
have
its
proper
written
expressly
for
it
so
as
to
contain
everything
that
class
had
to
learn
when
a
lesson
was
to
be
got
by
heart
from
the
book
the
teacher
was
first
to
read
it
to
the
class
explain
it
and
it
the
boys
then
to
read
it
aloud
by
turns
till
one
of
them
offered
to
repeat
it
without
book
the
others
were
to
do
the
same
as
soon
as
they
were
able
till
all
had
repeated
it
this
lesson
was
then
to
be
worked
over
again
as
a
writing
lesson
in
the
higher
forms
of
the
vernacular
school
a
modern
language
was
to
be
taught
and
duly
practised
here
we
see
a
regular
school
course
projected
which
differed
essentially
from
the
only
complete
school
course
still
earlier
that
of
the
jesuits
in
education
comenius
was
immeasurably
in
advance
of
loyola
and
aquaviva
like
the
great
thinkers
pestalozzi
and
froebel
who
most
resemble
him
he
thought
of
the
development
of
the
child
from
its
birth
and
in
a
singularly
wise
little
book
called
materni
or
of
the
breast
he
has
given
advice
for
bringing
up
children
to
the
age
of
six
very
interesting
are
the
hints
here
given
in
which
we
get
the
first
approaches
to
kindergarten
training
comenius
saw
that
much
as
their
elders
might
do
to
develop
powers
of
thought
and
expression
children
of
the
same
age
and
the
same
manners
and
habits
are
of
greater
service
still
when
they
talk
or
play
together
they
sharpen
each
other
more
effectually
for
the
one
does
not
surpass
the
other
in
depth
of
invention
and
there
is
among
them
no
assumption
of
superiority
of
the
one
over
the
other
only
love
candour
free
questionings
and
of
vi
p
the
constant
activity
of
children
must
be
provided
for
is
better
to
play
than
to
be
idle
for
during
play
the
mind
is
intent
on
some
object
which
often
sharpens
the
abilities
in
this
way
children
may
be
early
exercised
to
an
active
life
without
any
difficulty
since
nature
herself
stirs
them
up
to
be
doing
ix
the
second
third
fourth
years
let
their
spirits
be
stirred
up
by
means
of
agreeable
play
with
them
or
their
playing
among
themselves
nay
if
some
little
occupation
can
be
conveniently
provided
for
the
eyes
ears
or
other
senses
these
will
contribute
to
its
vigour
of
mind
and
vi
we
have
the
usual
cautions
against
forcing
fruit
is
useful
for
the

but
will
not

whereas
late
fruit
may
be
kept
all
the
year
as
some
natural
capacities
would
fly
as
it
were
before
the
sixth
the
fifth
or
even
the
fourth
year
yet
it
will
be
beneficial
rather
to
restrain
than
permit
this
but
very
much
worse
to
enforce
is
safer
that
the
brain
be
rightly
consolidated
before
it
begin
to
sustain
labours
in
a
little
child
the
whole
is
scarcely
closed
and
the
brain
consolidated
within
the
fifth
or
sixth
year
it
is
sufficient
therefore
for
this
age
to
comprehend
spontaneously
imperceptibly
and
as
it
were
in
play
so
much
as
is
employed
in
the
domestic
chap
xi
one
disastrous
tendency
has
always
shown
itself
in
the
tendency
to
sever
all
connection
between
studies
in
the
schoolroom
and
life
outside
the
young
pack
away
their
knowledge
as
it
were
in
compartments
where
it
may
lie
conveniently
till
the
scholastic
voyage
is
over
and
it
can
be
again
unshipped
against
this
tendency
many
great
teachers
have
striven
and
none
more
vigorously
than
comenius
like
pestalozzi
he
sought
to
resolve
everything
into
its
simplest
elements
and
he
finds
the
commencements
before
the
school
age
in
the
of
he
says
speaking
of
rhetoric
aim
is
to
shew
although
this
is
not
generally
attended
to
that
the
roots
of
all
sciences
and
arts
in
every
instance
arise
as
early
as
in
the
tender
age
and
that
on
these
foundations
it
is
neither
impossible
nor
difficult
for
the
whole
superstructure
to
be
laid
provided
always
that
we
act
reasonably
with
a
reasonable
viij
this
principle
he
applies
in
his
chapter
children
ought
to
be
accustomed
to
an
active
life
and
perpetual
chap
vij
in
the
fourth
and
fifth
year
their
powers
are
to
be
drawn
out
in
mechanical
or
architectural
efforts
in
drawing
and
writing
in
music
in
arithmetic
geometry
and
dialectics
for
arithmetic
in
the
fourth
fifth
or
sixth
year
it
will
be
sufficient
if
they
count
up
to
twenty
and
they
may
be
taught
to
play
at
and
in
geometry
they
may
learn
in
the
fourth
year
what
are
lines
what
are
squares
what
are
circles
also
the
usual
pint
quart
and
soon
they
should
try
to
measure
and
weigh
for
themselves
similar
beginnings
are
found
for
other
sciences
such
as
physics
astronomy
geography
history
economics
and
politics
elements
of
will
be
during
the
course
of
the
first
year
and
thenceforward
when
children
begin
to
distinguish
between
their
cradles
and
their

this
geographical
knowledge
extends

in

comenius
is
careful
to
provide
children
with
occupation
for
and
iv
drawing
is
to
be
practised
by
all
matters
not
says
comenius
the
objects
be
correctly
drawn
or
otherwise
that
they
afford
delight
to
the
we
see
then
that
this
restless
thinker
considered
the
entire
course
of
a
from
the
cradle
to
maturity
and
we
can
not
doubt
that
raumer
is
right
in
saying
influence
of
comenius
on
subsequent
thinkers
and
workers
in
education
especially
on
the
methodizers
is
ij
before
we
think
of
his
methods
and
school
books
let
us
inquire
what
he
did
for
education
that
has
proved
to
be
on
a
solid
foundation
and
liable
to
any
he
was
the
first
to
reach
a
standpoint
which
was
and
perhaps
always
will
be
above
the
heads
of
practical
men
and
demand
for
design
for
all
who
have
been
born
human
beings
general
instruction
to
fit
them
for
everything
human
they
must
therefore
as
far
as
possible
be
taught
together
so
that
they
may
mutually
draw
each
other
out
enliven
and
stimulate
of
the
the
end
and
aim
will
be
that
all
the
youth
of
both
sexes
between
the
sixth
and
the
twelfth
or
thirteenth
years
be
taught
those
things
which
will
be
useful
to
them
all
their
life
in
these
days
we
often
hear
controversies
between
the
men
of
science
and
the
ministers
of
religion
it
is
as
far
beyond
my
intention
as
it
is
beyond
my
abilities
to
discuss
how
far
the
antithesis
between
religion
and
science
is
a
true
one
but
our
subject
sometimes
forces
us
to
observe
that
religion
and
science
often
bring
thinkers
by
different
paths
to
the
same
result
they
both
refuse
to
recognise
class
distinctions
and
make
us
see
an
essential
unity
underlying
superficial
variations
in
comenius
we
have
an
earnest
christian
minister
who
was
also
an
enthusiast
for
science
moreover
he
was
without
social
and
virtually
without
national
restrictions
and
he
was
thus
in
a
good
position
for
expressing
freely
and
without
bias
what
both
his
science
and
his
religion
taught
him
only
are
the
children
of
the
rich
and
noble
to
be
drawn
to
the
school
but
all
alike
gentle
and
simple
rich
and
poor
boys
and
girls
in
great
towns
and
small
down
to
the
country
villages
and
for
this
reason
every
one
who
is
born
a
human
being
is
born
with
this
he
should
be
a
human
being
that
is
a
reasonable
creature
ruling
over
the
other
creatures
and
bearing
the
likeness
of
his
ix
this
sounds
to
me
nobler
than
the
utterances
of
rousseau
and
the
french
revolutionists
not
to
mention
locke
who
fell
back
on
considering
merely
even
bishop
butler
a
century
after
comenius
hardly
takes
so
firm
a
ground
though
he
lays
it
down
that
have
as
much
right
to
some
proper
education
as
to
have
their
lives
the
first
man
who
demanded
training
for
every
human
being
he
or
she
was
a
human
must
always
be
thought
of
with
respect
and
gratitude
by
all
who
care
either
for
science
or
religion
it
has
taken
us
years
to
reach
the
standpoint
of
comenius
but
we
have
reached
it
or
almost
reached
it
at
last
and
when
we
have
once
got
hold
of
the
idea
we
are
not
likely
to
lose
it
again
the
only
question
is
whether
we
shall
not
go
on
and
in
the
end
agree
with
comenius
that
the
primary
school
shall
be
for
rich
and
poor
alike
at
present
the
practical
men
in
england
especially
have
things
all
their
own
way
but
their
horizon
is
and
must
be
very
limited
they
have
already
had
to
adjust
themselves
to
many
things
which
their
predecessors
declared
to
be
may
not
their
successors
in
like
manner
get
accustomed
to
other
things
this
scheme
of
comenius
among
them
the
champions
of
realism
have
always
recognised
comenius
as
one
of
their
earliest
leaders
bacon
had
just
given
voice
to
the
scientific
spirit
which
had
at
length
rebelled
against
the
literary
spirit
dominant
at
the
renascence
and
had
begun
to
turn
from
all
that
had
been
thought
and
said
about
nature
straight
to
nature
herself
comenius
was
the
professed
disciple
of
noble
verulam
who
said
he
given
us
the
true
key
of
furnished
with
this
key
comenius
would
unlock
the
door
of
the
for
himself
grieved
me
he
says
i
saw
most
noble
verulam
present
us
indeed
with
a
true
key
of
nature
but
not
to
open
the
secrets
of
nature
only
shewing
us
by
a
few
examples
how
they
were
to
be
opened
and
leave
leaving
the
rest
to
depend
on
observations
and
inductions
continued
for
several
comenius
thought
that
by
the
light
of
the
senses
of
reason
and
of
the
bible
he
might
advance
faster
what
are
not
we
as
well
as
the
old
philosophers
placed
in
garden
why
then
do
we
not
cast
about
our
eyes
nostrils
and
ears
as
well
as
they
why
should
we
learn
the
works
of
nature
of
any
other
master
rather
than
of
these
our
senses
why
do
we
not
i
say
turn
over
the
living
book
of
the
world
instead
of
dead
papers
in
it
we
may
contemplate
more
things
and
with
greater
delight
and
profit
than
any
one
can
tell
us
if
we
have
anywhere
need
of
an
interpreter
the
maker
of
nature
is
the
best
interpreter
preface
to
philosophie
english
several
things
are
involved
in
this
first
comenius
would
fix
the
mind
of
learners
on
material
objects
secondly
he
would
have
them
acquire
their
notions
of
these
for
themselves
through
the
senses
from
these
two
principles
he
drew
the
corollary
that
the
vast
accumulation
of
traditional
learning
and
literature
must
be
thrown
overboard
the
demand
for
the
study
of
things
has
been
best
formulated
by
one
of
the
greatest
masters
of
words
by
milton
our
understanding
can
not
in
the
body
found
itself
but
on
sensible
things
nor
arrive
so
clearly
to
the
knowledge
of
god
and
things
invisible
as
by
orderly
conning
over
the
visible
and
inferior
creature
the
same
method
is
necessarily
to
be
followed
in
all
discreet
its
material
surroundings
then
are
to
be
the
subjects
on
which
the
mind
of
the
child
must
be
fixed
this
being
settled
comenius
demands
that
the
knowledge
shall
not
be
but
realism
knowledge
derived
at
first
hand
through
the
senses
on
this
subject
comenius
may
speak
for
himself
ground
of
this
business
is
that
sensual
objects
we
now
say
why
not
be
rightly
presented
to
the
senses
for
fear
they
may
not
be
received
i
say
and
say
it
again
aloud
that
this
last
is
the
foundation
of
all
the
rest
because
we
can
neither
act
nor
speak
wisely
unless
we
first
rightly
understand
all
the
things
which
are
to
be
done
and
whereof
we
have
to
speak
now
there
is
nothing
in
the
understanding
which
was
not
before
in
the
sense
and
therefore
to
exercise
the
senses
well
about
the
right
perceiving
the
differences
of
things
will
be
to
lay
the
grounds
for
all
wisdom
and
all
wise
discourse
and
all
discreet
actions
in
course
of
life
which
because
it
is
commonly
neglected
in
schools
and
the
things
that
are
to
be
learned
are
offered
to
scholars
without
their
being
understood
or
being
rightly
presented
to
the
senses
it
cometh
to
pass
that
the
work
of
teaching
and
learning
goeth
heavily
onward
and
affordeth
little
preface
to
trans
without
going
into
any
metaphysical
discussion
we
must
all
agree
that
a
vast
amount
of
impressions
come
to
children
through
the
senses
and
that
it
is
by
the
exercise
of
the
senses
that
they
learn
most
readily
as
comenius
says
senses
being
the
main
guides
of
childhood
because
therein
the
mind
doth
not
as
yet
raise
up
it
self
to
an
abstracted
contemplation
of
things
evermore
seek
their
own
objects
and
if
these
be
away
they
grow
dull
and
wry
themselves
hither
and
thither
out
of
a
weariness
of
themselves
but
when
their
objects
are
present
they
grow
merry
wax
lively
and
willingly
suffer
themselves
to
be
fastened
upon
them
till
the
thing
be
sufficiently
to
this
truth
lay
at
the
root
of
most
of
the
methods
of
pestalozzi
and
though
it
has
had
little
effect
on
teaching
in
england
where
for
the
word
there
is
no
equivalent
everything
that
goes
on
in
a
german
folkschool
has
reference
to
it
for
children
then
comenius
gave
good
counsel
when
he
would
have
their
senses
exercised
on
the
world
about
them
but
after
all
whatever
may
be
thought
of
the
proposition
that
all
knowledge
comes
through
the
senses
we
must
not
ignore
what
is
bequeathed
to
us
both
in
science
and
in
literature
comenius
says
now
i
beseech
you
let
this
be
our
business
that
the
schools
may
cease
to
and
begin
to
cease
to
and
begin
to
cease
lastly
to
and
begin
to
for
that
aristotellical
maxim
oportet
a
learner
must
believe
is
as
tyrannical
as
it
is
dangerous
so
also
is
that
same
pythagorean
the
master
has
said
let
no
man
be
compelled
to
swear
to
his
masters
words
but
let
the
things
themselves
constrain
the
to
phil
but
the
things
themselves
will
not
take
us
far
even
in
natural
science
we
need
teachers
for
science
is
not
reached
through
the
senses
but
through
the
intellectual
grasp
of
knowledge
which
has
been
accumulating
for
centuries
if
the
education
of
times
past
has
neglected
the
senses
we
must
not
demand
that
the
education
of
the
future
should
care
for
the
senses
only
there
is
as
yet
little
danger
of
our
thinking
too
much
of
physical
education
but
we
sometimes
hear
reformers
talking
as
if
the
true
ideal
were
sketched
in
hall
they
shall
dive
and
they
shall
run
catch
the
wild
goat
by
the
hair
and
hurl
their
lances
in
the
sun
whistle
back
the
call
and
leap
the
rainbows
of
the
brooks
not
with
blinded
eyesight
poring
over
miserable
there
seems
however
still
some
reason
for
counting
gray
barbarian
lower
than
the
christian
and
the
reason
is
that
we
are
heirs
of
all
the
our
education
must
enable
every
child
to
enter
in
some
measure
on
his
inheritance
and
not
a
few
of
our
most
precious
heirlooms
will
be
found
not
only
in
scientific
discoveries
but
also
in
those
great
works
of
literature
which
the
votaries
of
science
are
apt
to
despise
as
this
truth
was
not
duly
appreciated
by
comenius
as
professor
laurie
well
says
accepted
only
in
a
way
the
products
of
the
genius
of
past
p
in
his
day
there
was
a
violent
reaction
from
the
renascence
passion
for
literature
and
comenius
would
entirely
banish
from
education
the
only
literatures
which
were
then
important
the
literatures
of
greece
and
rome
most
learned
men
says
he
among
the
theologians
take
from
christ
only
the
mask
the
blood
and
life
they
draw
from
aristotle
and
a
crowd
of
other
see
pp
ff
so
for
cicero
and
virgil
he
would
substitute
and
his
contemporaries
at
first
seemed
willing
to
accept
the
but
though
there
may
be
much
more
knowledge
in
the
the
classics
have
survived
it
in
these
days
there
is
a
passion
for
the
study
of
things
which
in
its
intensity
resembles
the
renascence
passion
for
literature
there
is
a
craving
for
knowledge
and
we
know
only
the
truths
we
can
verify
so
this
craving
must
be
satisfied
not
by
words
but
things
and
yet
that
domain
which
the
physicists
contemptuously
describe
as
the
study
of
words
must
not
be
lost
sight
of
indeed
can
not
be
either
by
young
or
old
as
matthew
arnold
has
said
who
are
for
giving
to
natural
knowledge
the
chief
place
in
the
education
of
the
majority
of
mankind
leave
one
important
thing
out
of
their
constitution
of
human
live
by
admiration
hope
and
love
and
as
these
are
well
and
wisely
fixed
in
dignity
of
being
we
so
says
wordsworth
and
if
this
assertion
can
not
be
verified
no
more
can
it
be
disproved
that
the
words
have
become
almost
proverbial
shows
that
it
commends
itself
to
the
general
consciousness
whatever
knowledge
we
may
acquire
it
will
have
little
effect
on
our
lives
unless
we
can
again
to
use
matthew
words
our
sense
of
conduct
and
our
sense
of
in
and
so
long
as
we
retain
our
sense
for
these
are
safe
like
milton
we
may
have
no
inclination
to
study
januas
but
we
shall
not
cease
to
value
many
of
the
works
which
the
janua
of
comenius
was
supposed
to
have
supplanted
are
good
for
illustration
not
for
if
comenius
had
accepted
this
caution
he
would
have
escaped
much
useless
labour
and
might
have
had
a
better
foundation
for
his
rules
than
fanciful
applications
of
what
he
observed
in
the
external
world
as
august
vogel
has
said
unquestionably
right
in
wishing
to
draw
his
principles
of
education
from
nature
but
instead
of
examining
the
proper
constitution
and
nature
of
man
and
taking
that
as
the
basis
of
his
theory
he
watches
the
life
of
birds
the
growth
of
trees
or
the
quiet
influence
of
the
sun
and
thus
substitutes
for
the
nature
of
man
nature
man
objective
and
yet
by
nature
he
understands
that
first
and
primordial
state
to
which
as
to
our
original
idea
we
should
be
restored
and
by
the
voice
of
nature
he
understands
the
universal
providence
of
god
or
the
ceaseless
influence
of
the
divine
goodness
working
all
in
all
that
is
leading
every
creature
to
the
state
ordained
for
it
the
vegetative
and
animal
life
in
nature
is
according
to
comenius
himself
not
life
at
all
in
its
highest
sense
but
the
only
true
life
is
the
intellectual
or
spiritual
life
of
man
no
doubt
in
the
two
lower
kinds
of
life
certain
analogies
may
be
found
for
the
higher
but
nothing
can
be
less
worthy
of
reliance
and
less
scientific
than
a
method
which
draws
its
principles
for
the
higher
life
from
what
has
been
observed
in
the
pädagogik
als
p
this
seems
to
me
judicious
criticism
but
whatever
mistakes
he
may
have
made
comenius
like
froebel
long
after
him
strove
after
a
higher
unity
which
should
embrace
knowledge
of
every
kind
the
connexion
of
knowledges
so
constantly
overlooked
in
the
schoolroom
was
always
in
his
thoughts
see
that
the
branches
of
a
tree
can
not
live
unless
they
all
alike
suck
their
juices
from
a
common
trunk
with
common
roots
and
can
we
hope
that
the
branches
of
wisdom
can
be
torn
asunder
with
safety
to
their
life
that
is
to
truth
can
one
be
a
natural
philosopher
who
is
not
also
a
metaphysician
or
an
ethical
thinker
who
does
not
know
something
of
physical
science
or
a
logician
who
has
no
knowledge
of
real
matters
or
a
theologian
a
jurisconsult
or
a
physician
who
is
not
first
a
philosopher
or
an
orator
or
poet
who
is
not
all
these
at
once
he
deprives
himself
of
light
of
hand
and
of
regulation
who
pushes
away
from
him
any
shred
of
the
quoted
in
of
vol
from
the
delineatio
conf
newman
of
a
disc
iij
we
see
then
that
on
the
side
of
theory
comenius
was
truly
great
but
the
practical
man
who
has
always
been
the
tyrant
of
the
schoolroom
cared
nothing
for
theory
and
held
with
a
modern
english
minister
responsible
for
education
who
proved
his
ignorance
of
theory
by
his
code
that
there
was
and
could
be
no
such
thing
so
the
reputation
of
comenius
became
pretty
much
what
our
great
authority
hallam
has
recorded
that
he
was
a
person
of
some
ingenuity
and
little
judgment
who
invented
a
new
way
of
learning
latin
this
estimate
of
him
enables
us
to
follow
some
windings
in
the
stream
of
thought
about
education
comenius
faced
the
whole
problem
in
its
double
bearing
theory
and
practice
he
asked
what
is
the
task
how
can
he
best
accomplish
it
but
his
contemporaries
had
not
yet
recovered
from
the
idolatry
of
latin
which
had
been
bequeathed
to
them
by
their
fathers
from
the
renascence
and
they
too
saw
in
comenius
chiefly
an
inventor
of
a
new
way
of
learning
latin
he
sought
to
train
up
children
for
this
world
and
the
next
they
supposed
as
oxenstiern
himself
said
that
the
main
thing
to
be
remedied
was
the
clumsy
way
of
teaching
latin
so
comenius
was
little
understood
his
books
were
seized
upon
as
affording
at
once
an
introduction
to
the
knowledge
of
and
a
short
way
of
learning
latin
but
in
the
long
run
they
were
found
more
tiresome
than
the
old
classics
so
they
went
out
of
fashion
and
their
author
was
forgotten
with
them
now
that
schoolmasters
are
forming
a
more
worthy
conception
of
their
office
they
are
beginning
to
do
justice
to
comenius
as
the
jesuits
kept
to
latin
as
the
common
language
of
the
church
so
comenius
thought
to
use
it
as
a
means
of
for
the
instructed
of
every
nationality
but
he
was
singularly
free
from
the
value
of
latin
and
he
demanded
that
all
nations
should
be
taught
in
their
own
language
wherein
they
were
born
on
this
subject
he
expresses
himself
with
great
emphasis
desire
and
protest
that
studies
of
wisdom
be
no
longer
committed
to
latin
alone
and
kept
shut
up
in
the
schools
as
has
hitherto
been
done
to
the
greatest
contempt
and
injury
of
the
people
at
large
and
the
popular
tongues
let
all
things
be
delivered
to
each
nation
in
its
own
in
masson
comenius
was
then
neither
a
verbalist
nor
a
classicist
and
yet
his
contemporaries
were
not
entirely
wrong
in
thinking
of
him
as
man
who
had
invented
a
new
way
of
learning
his
great
principle
was
that
instruction
in
words
and
things
should
go
together
the
young
were
to
learn
about
things
and
the
same
were
to
acquire
both
in
the
vernacular
and
also
in
latin
the
international
tongue
the
words
which
were
connected
with
the
things
having
settled
on
this
plan
of
concurrent
instruction
in
words
and
things
comenius
determined
to
write
a
book
for
carrying
it
out
just
then
there
fell
into
his
hands
a
book
which
a
less
man
might
have
thrown
aside
on
account
of
its
origin
for
it
was
written
by
the
bitter
foes
and
persecutors
of
the
bohemian
protestants
by
the
jesuits
but
comenius
says
truly
care
not
whether
i
teach
or
whether
i
learn
and
he
gave
a
marvellous
proof
of
this
by
adopting
the
linguistic
method
of
the
this
ark
for
words
treated
in
a
series
of
proverbs
of
all
kinds
of
subjects
in
such
a
way
as
to
introduce
in
a
natural
connection
every
common
word
in
the
latin
language
idea
says
comenius
better
than
the
execution
nevertheless
inasmuch
as
they
the
jesuits
were
the
prime
inventors
we
thankfully
acknowledge
it
nor
will
we
upbraid
them
with
those
errors
they
have
preface
to
trans
of
the
plan
commended
itself
to
comenius
on
various
grounds
first
he
had
a
notion
of
giving
an
outline
of
all
knowledge
before
anything
was
taught
in
detail
next
he
could
by
such
a
book
connect
the
teaching
about
simple
things
with
instruction
in
the
latin
words
which
applied
to
them
and
thirdly
he
hoped
by
this
means
to
give
such
a
complete
latin
vocabulary
as
to
render
the
use
of
latin
easy
for
all
requirements
of
modern
society
he
accordingly
wrote
a
short
account
of
things
in
general
which
he
put
in
the
form
of
a
dialogue
and
this
he
published
in
latin
and
german
at
leszna
in
the
success
of
this
work
as
we
have
already
seen
was
prodigious
no
doubt
the
spirit
which
animated
bacon
was
largely
diffused
among
educated
men
in
all
countries
and
they
hailed
the
appearance
of
a
book
which
called
the
youth
from
the
study
of
old
philosophical
ideas
to
observe
the
facts
around
them
the
countrymen
of
bacon
were
not
backward
in
adopting
the
new
work
as
the
following
from
the
of
a
volume
in
the
british
museum
will
show
gate
of
tongues
unlocked
and
opened
or
else
a
seminary
or
of
all
tongues
and
sciences
that
is
a
short
way
of
teaching
and
thoroughly
learning
within
a
yeare
and
a
half
at
the
furthest
the

english
french
and
any
other
tongue
with
the
ground
and
foundation
of
arts
and
sciences
comprised
under
a
hundred
titles
and
periods
in
latin
first
and
now
as
a
token
of
thankfulness
brought
to
light
in
latine
english
and
french
in
the
behalfe
of
the
most
illustrious
prince
charles
and
of
british
french
and
irish
youth
the
edition
much
enlarged
by
the
labour
and
industry
of
john
anchoran
licentiate
in
divinity
london
printed
by
edward
griffin
for
michael
sparke
dwelling
at
the
blew
bible
in
green
arbor
the
first
edition
must
have
been
some
years
earlier
and
the
work
contains
a
letter
to
anchoran
from
comenius
dated
polonorum
leszna
oct
so
we
see
that
however
the
connexion
arose
it
was
anchoran
not
hartlib
who
first
made
comenius
known
in
england
in
the
preface
to
the
volume
signed
by
anchoran
and
comenius
we
read
of
the
complaints
of
vives
erasmus
sturmius
frisclinus
dornavius
and
the
scaligers
and
lipsius
did
climb
but
left
no
track
it
is
that
the
greater
number
of
schools
howsoever
some
boast
the
happinesse
of
the
age
and
the
splendour
of
learning
have
not
as
yet
shaked
off
their
ataxies
the
youth
was
held
off
nay
distracted
and
is
yet
in
many
places
delayed
with
grammar
precepts
infinitely
tedious
perplexed
obscure
and
for
the
most
part
unprofitable
and
that
for
many
the
names
of
things
were
taught
to
those
who
were
in
total
ignorance
of
the
things
themselves
from
this
barren
region
the
pupil
was
to
escape
to
become
acquainted
with
things
on
says
the
teacher
in
the
opening
dialogue
us
go
forth
into
the
open
air
there
you
shall
view
whatsoever
god
produced
from
the
beginning
and
doth
yet
effect
by
nature
afterwards
we
will
go
into
towns
shops
schools
where
you
shall
see
how
men
do
both
apply
those
divine
works
to
their
uses
and
also
instruct
themselves
in
arts
manners
tongues
then
we
will
enter
into
houses
courts
and
palaces
of
princes
to
see
in
what
manner
communities
of
men
are
governed
at
last
we
will
visit
temples
where
you
shall
observe
how
diversely
mortals
seek
to
worship
their
creator
and
to
be
spiritually
united
unto
him
and
how
he
by
his
almightiness
disposeth
all
this
is
from
the
edition
by
the
book
is
still
amusing
but
only
from
the
quaint
manner
in
which
the
mode
of
life
two
hundred
years
ago
is
described
in
it
but
though
parts
of
the
book
may
on
first
reading
have
gratified
the
youth
of
the
seventeenth
century
a
great
deal
of
it
gave
scanty
information
about
difficult
subjects
such
as
physiology
geometry
logic
rhetoric
and
that
too
in
the
driest
and
dullest
way
moreover
in
his
first
version
much
modified
at
comenius
following
the
jesuit
boasts
that
no
important
word
occurs
twice
so
that
the
book
to
attain
the
end
of
giving
a
perfect
stock
of
latin
words
would
have
to
be
read
and
till
it
was
almost
known
by
heart
and
however
amusing
boys
might
find
an
account
of
their
toys
written
in
latin
the
first
time
of
reading
the
interest
would
somewhat
wear
away
by
the
fifth
or
sixth
time
we
can
not
then
feel
much
surprised
on
reading
this
verdict
written
some
years
later
touching
those
earlier
works
of
comenius
are
of
singular
use
and
very
advantageous
to
those
of
more
discretion
especially
to
such
as
have
already
got
a
smattering
in
latin
to
help
their
memories
to
retain
what
they
have
scatteringly
gotten
here
and
there
and
to
furnish
them
with
many
words
which
perhaps
they
had
not
formerly
read
or
so
well
observed
but
to
young
children
whom
we
have
chiefly
to
instruct
as
those
that
are
ignorant
altogether
of
most
things
and
words
they
prove
rather
a
mere
toil
and
burden
than
a
delight
and
chas
preface
to
his
trans
of
dated
my
school
in
london
the
would
therefore
have
had
but
a
popularity
with
teachers
and
a
still
shorter
with
learners
if
comenius
had
not
carried
out
his
principle
of
appealing
to
the
senses
and
adopted
a
plan
which
had
been
suggested
nearly
years
earlier
by
a
protestant
divine
lubinus
of
rostock
the
artist
was
called
in
and
with
endter
at
nürnberg
in
was
published
the
first
edition
of
a
book
which
long
outlived
the
this
was
the
famous
sensualium
which
was
used
for
a
century
at
least
in
many
a
schoolroom
and
lives
in
imitations
to
the
present
day
comenius
wrote
this
book
on
the
same
lines
as
the
but
he
goes
into
less
detail
and
every
subject
is
illustrated
by
a
small
engraving
the
text
is
mostly
on
the
opposite
page
to
the
picture
and
is
connected
with
it
by
a
series
of
corresponding
numbers
everything
named
in
the
text
is
numbered
as
in
the
picture
the
artist
employed
must
have
been
a
bold
man
as
he
sticks
at
nothing
but
in
skill
he
was
not
the
equal
of
many
of
his
contemporaries
witness
the
pictures
in
the
schaffhausen
editio
secunda
schaffhusi
in
edition
of
the
and
the
very
small
but
beautiful
illustrations
in
the
of
redinger
and
amsterdam
however
the
gives
such
a
quaint
delineation
of
life
years
ago
that
copies
with
the
original
engravings
keep
rising
in
value
and
an
american
publisher
bardeen
of
syracuse
new
york
has
lately
reproduced
the
old
book
with
the
help
of
photography
and
yet
as
instruments
of
teaching
these
books
the
and
the
and
even
the
which
in
a
great
measure
superseded
both
proved
a
failure
how
shall
we
account
for
this
comenius
immensely
the
importance
of
knowledge
and
the
power
of
the
human
mind
to
acquire
knowledge
he
took
it
for
the
heavenly
idea
that
should
know
all
this
notion
started
him
on
the
wrong
road
for
forming
a
scheme
of
instruction
and
it
needed
many
years
and
much
experience
to
show
him
his
error
when
he
wrote
the
he
said
of
it
is
little
as
you
see
of
no
great
bulk
yet
a
brief
of
the
whole
world
and
a
whole
language
trans
preface
and
he
afterwards
speaks
of
our
of
things
subject
to
the
but
in
his
old
age
he
saw
that
his
were
too
condensed
and
attempted
too
much
laurie
and
he
admitted
that
after
all
seneca
was
right
est
scire
pauca
et
iis
recté
uti
quam
scire
multa
quorum
ignores
usum
it
is
better
to
know
a
few
things
and
have
the
right
use
of
them
than
to
know
many
things
which
you
can
not
use
at
the
attempt
to
give
has
been
the
ruin
of
a
vast
number
of
professing
educators
since
comenius
masters
the
old
whom
some
of
us
can
still
remember
made
boys
learn
latin
and
greek
grammar
and
their
successors
seem
to
think
that
boys
should
not
learn
latin
and
greek
grammar
but
and
the
last
error
i
take
to
be
much
worse
than
the
first
as
ruskin
has
neatly
said
education
is
not
teaching
people
to
know
what
they
do
not
know
but
to
behave
as
they
do
not
behave
it
is
to
be
judged
not
by
the
knowledge
acquired
but
the
habits
powers
interests
knowledge
must
be
thought
of
and
so
the
attempt
to
teach
about
everything
was
unwise
the
means
adopted
were
unwise
also
it
is
a
great
mistake
to
suppose
that
a
should
come
first
this
is
not
the
right
way
to
give
knowledge
in
any
subject
child
begins
by
seeing
bits
of
a
little
and
there
a
little
it
makes
up
its
wholes
out
of
its
own
littles
and
is
long
in
reaching
the
fulness
of
a
whole
and
in
this
we
are
children
all
our
lives
in
john
brown
in
p
so
nothing
could
have
been
much
more
unfortunate
than
an
attempt
to
give
the
young
brief
of
the
whole
corresponding
to
brief
of
the
whole
world
comenius
offers
brief
of
a
whole
the
two
mistakes
were
well
matched
in
whole
there
are
a
vast
number
of
things
of
which
we
must
and
a
good
number
of
which
we
very
advantageously
be
ignorant
in
a
language
there
are
many
words
which
we
can
not
know
and
many
more
which
we
do
not
want
to
know
the
language
lives
for
us
in
a
small
vocabulary
of
essential
words
and
our
hold
upon
the
language
depends
upon
the
power
we
have
in
receiving
and
expressing
thought
by
means
of
those
words
but
the
jesuit
bath
and
after
him
comenius
made
the
tremendous
mistake
of
treating
all
latin
words
as
of
equal
value
and
took
credit
for
using
each
word
once
and
once
only
moreover
comenius
wrote
not
simply
to
teach
the
latin
language
but
also
to
stretch
the
latin
language
till
it
covered
the
whole
area
of
modern
life
he
aimed
at
two
things
and
missed
them
both
we
see
then
that
comenius
was
not
what
hallam
calls
him
man
who
invented
a
new
way
of
learning
he
did
not
do
this
but
he
did
much
more
than
this
he
saw
that
every
human
creature
should
be
trained
up
to
become
a
reasonable
being
and
that
the
training
should
be
such
as
to
draw
out
faculties
thus
he
struck
the
of
the
science
of
education
the
quantity
and
the
diffuseness
of
the
writings
of
comenius
are
truly
bewildering
in
these
days
eminent
men
carlyle
sometimes
find
it
difficult
to
get
into
print
but
all
over
europe
seemed
to
be
at
the
service
of

the
gentlemen
of
in
the
by
far
the
most
successful
schoolmasters
were
the
jesuits
in
spite
of
their
exclusion
from
the
university
they
had
in
the
province
of
paris
some
pupils
and
in
paris
itself
at
the
collège
de
clermont
might
they
not
have
neglected
little
schools
which
were
organized
by
the
friends
and
disciples
of
the
abbé
de
schools
in
which
the
numbers
were
always
small
about
twenty
or
and
only
once
increasing
to
fifty
and
yet
the
jesuits
left
no
stone
unturned
no
weapon
unemployed
in
their
attack
on
little
the
conflict
seems
to
us
like
an
engagement
between
a
and
a
that
the
poor
would
soon
be
beneath
the
waves
was
clear
enough
from
the
beginning
and
she
did
indeed
speedily
disappear
but
the
victors
have
never
recovered
from
their
victory
and
never
will
whenever
we
think
of
jesuitism
we
are
not
more
forcibly
reminded
of
loyola
than
of
pascal
all
educated
frenchmen
most
educated
people
everywhere
get
their
best
remembered
impressions
of
the
society
of
loyola
from
the
provincial
letters
the
society
had
a
long
standing
rivalry
with
the
university
of
paris
and
the
university
not
only
refused
to
admit
the
jesuits
but
several
times
petitioned
the
parliament
to
chase
them
out
of
france
on
one
of
these
occasions
the
advocate
who
was
retained
by
the
university
was
antoine
arnauld
a
man
of
renowned
eloquence
and
he
threw
himself
into
the
attack
with
all
his
heart
from
that
time
the
jesuits
had
a
standing
feud
with
the
house
of
arnauld
but
it
was
no
mere
personal
dislike
that
separated
the
and
the
jesuits
with
which
the
arnauld
family
was
so
closely
united
became
the
stronghold
of
a
theology
which
was
unlike
that
of
the
jesuits
and
was
denounced
by
them
as
heresy
the
daughter
of
antoine
arnauld
was
made
at
the
age
of
eleven
years
abbess
of
a
cistercian
convent
not
far
from
versailles
this
position
was
obtained
for
her
by
a
fraud
of
marion
henry
who
thought
only
of
providing
comfortably
for
one
of
the
twenty
children
to
whom
his
daughter
made
arnauld
had
made
him
grandfather
never
was
a
nomination
more
scandalously
obtained
or
used
to
better
purpose
the
mère
angélique
is
one
of
the
saints
of
the
universal
church
and
she
soon
became
the
restorer
of
the
religious
life
first
in
her
own
and
then
by
her
influence
and
example
in
other
convents
of
her
order
in
these
reforms
she
had
nothing
to
fear
from
her
hereditary
foes
the
jesuits
but
she
soon
came
under
the
influence
of
a
man
whose
theory
of
life
was
as
much
opposed
to
the
theory
as
to
that
of
the
world
which
found
in
the
jesuits
the
most
accommodating
father
confessors
duvergier
de
hauranne
better
known
by
the
name
of
his
was
one
of
those
commanding
spirits
who
seem
born
to
direct
others
and
form
a
distinct
society
in
vain
richelieu
offered
him
the
posts
most
likely
to
tempt
him
the
prize
that
had
set
his
heart
upon
was
not
of
this
world
and
richelieu
could
assist
him
in
one
way
persecution
this
assistance
the
cardinal
readily
granted
and
by
his
orders
was
imprisoned
at
vincennes
and
not
set
at
liberty
till
richelieu
was
himself
summoned
before
a
higher
tribunal
driven
by
prevailing
sickness
from
des
champs
the
mère
angélique
transported
her
community
in
to
a
house
purchased
for
them
in
paris
by
her
mother
who
in
her
widowhood
became
one
of
the
sisters
in
paris
angélique
sought
for
herself
and
her
convent
the
spiritual
direction
of
not
yet
a
prisoner
and
from
that
time
added
the
abbess
and
sisters
of
to
the
number
of
those
who
looked
up
to
him
as
their
pattern
and
guide
in
all
things
des
champs
was
in
course
of
time
occupied
by
a
band
of
solitaries
who
at
the
bidding
of
renounced
the
world
and
devoted
themselves
to
prayer
and
study
to
them
we
owe
the
works
of
gentlemen
of
it
is
then
to
we
must
look
for
the
ideas
which
became
the
distinctive
mark
of
the
was
before
all
things
a
theologian
in
his
early
days
at
bayonne
his
studies
had
been
shared
by
a
friend
who
afterwards
was
professor
of
theology
at
louvain
and
then
bishop
of
ypres
this
friend
was
jansenius
their
searches
after
truth
had
brought
them
to
opinions
which
in
the
england
of
the
nineteenth
century
are
known
as
according
to
teaching
all
those
who
receive
the
creed
and
the
sacraments
of
the
church
and
do
not
commit
sin
are
in
a
of
salvation
that
is
to
say
the
great
majority
of
christians
are
saved
this
teaching
is
rejected
by
those
of
another
school
of
thought
who
hold
that
only
a
few
are
saved
and
that
the
great
body
even
of
christians
are
doomed
to
perdition
such
a
belief
as
this
would
seem
to
be
associated
of
necessity
with
harshness
and
gloom
but
from
whatever
cause
there
has
been
found
in
many
even
in
most
cases
no
such
connexion
those
who
have
held
that
the
great
mass
of
their
had
no
hope
in
a
future
world
have
thrown
themselves
lovingly
into
all
attempts
to
improve
their
condition
in
this
world
still
their
main
effort
has
always
been
to
increase
the
number
of
the
converted
and
to
preserve
them
from
the
wiles
of
the
enemy
this
sought
to
do
by
selecting
a
few
children
and
bringing
them
up
in
their
tender
years
like
plants
in
the
hope
that
they
would
be
prepared
when
older
and
stronger
to
resist
the
evil
influences
of
the
world
his
first
plan
was
to
choose
out
of
all
paris
six
children
and
to
confide
them
to
the
care
of
a
priest
appointed
to
direct
their
consciences
and
a
tutor
of
not
more
than
years
old
to
teach
them
latin
should
think
says
he
was
doing
a
good
deal
if
i
did
not
advance
them
far
in
latin
before
the
age
of
twelve
and
made
them
pass
their
first
years
confined
to
one
house
or
a
monastery
in
the
country
where
they
might
be
allowed
all
the
pastimes
suited
to
their
age
and
where
they
might
see
only
the
example
of
a
good
life
set
by
those
about
letter
quoted
by
carré
p
his
imprisonment
put
a
stop
to
this
plan
says
do
not
lightly
break
off
what
i
undertake
for
god
so
when
intrusted
with
the
disposal
of
francs
by
bignon
he
started
the
first
school
in
which
two
small
sons
of
were
taken
as
pupils
the
name
of
schools
was
given
partly
perhaps
because
according
to
their
design
the
numbers
in
any
school
could
never
be
large
partly
no
doubt
to
deprecate
any
suspicion
of
rivalry
with
the
schools
of
the
university
the
children
were
to
be
taken
at
an
early
age
nine
or
ten
before
they
could
have
any
guilty
knowledge
of
evil
and
made
in
all
cases
a
stipulation
that
at
any
time
a
child
might
be
returned
to
his
friends
but
in
cases
where
the
care
seemed
successful
the
pupils
were
to
be
kept
under
it
till
they
were
grown
up
the
little
schools
had
a
short
and
troubled
career
of
hardly
more
than
fifteen
years
they
were
not
fully
organized
till
they
were
proscribed
a
few
years
later
and
in
were
finally
broken
up
by
louis
xiv
who
was
under
the
influence
of
their
enemies
the
jesuits
but
in
that
time
the
gentlemen
of
had
introduced
new
ideas
which
have
been
a
force
in
french
education
and
indeed
in
all
literary
education
ever
since
to
then
we
trace
the
attempt
at
a
particular
kind
of
school
and
to
his
followers
some
new
departures
in
the
training
of
the
intellect
basing
his
system
on
the
fall
of
man
came
to
a
conclusion
which
was
also
reached
by
locke
though
by
a
different
road
to
both
of
them
it
seemed
that
children
require
much
more
individual
care
and
watching
than
they
can
possibly
get
in
a
public
school
would
have
said
what
locke
said
difference
is
great
between
two
or
three
pupils
in
the
same
house
and
three
or
four
score
boys
lodged
up
and
down
for
let
the
industry
and
skill
be
never
so
great
it
is
impossible
he
should
have
fifty
or
one
hundred
scholars
under
his
eye
any
longer
than
they
are
in
school
together
nor
can
it
be
expected
that
he
should
instruct
them
successfully
in
anything
but
their
books
the
forming
of
their
minds
and
manners
preserving
them
from
the
danger
of
the
enemy
would
have
said
requiring
a
constant
attention
and
particular
application
to
every
single
boy
which
is
impossible
in
a
numerous
flock
and
would
be
wholly
in
vain
could
he
have
time
to
study
and
correct
peculiar
defects
and
wrong
inclinations
when
the
lad
was
to
be
left
to
himself
or
the
prevailing
infection
of
his
fellows
the
greater
part
of
the
an
english
public
schoolmaster
told
the
commission
on
public
schools
that
he
stood
loco
to
fifty
boys
a
large
family
observed
one
of
the
commissioners
drily
the
truth
is
that
in
the
bringing
up
of
the
young
there
is
the
place
of
the
schoolmaster
and
of
the
as
well
as
that
of
the
parents
and
of
these
several
forces
one
can
not
fulfil
the
functions
of
the
others
according
to
the
theory
or
at
least
the
practice
of
english
public
schools
boys
are
left
in
their
leisure
hours
to
organize
their
life
for
themselves
and
they
form
a
community
from
which
the
masters
are
partly
by
their
own
partly
by
the
traditions
of
the
school
utterly
excluded
from
this
the
intellectual
education
of
the
boys
no
doubt
suffers
them
in
conversation
with
men
of
parts
and
breeding
says
locke
and
this
was
the
old
notion
of
training
when
boys
of
good
family
grew
up
as
pages
in
the
household
of
some
nobleman
but
except
in
the
holidays
the
young
aristocrats
of
the
present
day
talk
only
with
other
boys
and
servants
and
tradesmen
hence
the
amount
of
thought
and
conversation
given
to
school
topics
especially
the
games
is
out
of
all
proportion
to
the
importance
of
such
things
and
this
does
much
to
increase
what
matthew
arnold
calls
inaptitude
for
ideas
what
are
we
to
say
about
the
effects
of
the
system
on
the
morals
of
the
boys
if
we
were
to
start
like
from
the
doctrine
of
human
depravity
we
should
entirely
condemn
the
system
and
predict
from
it
the
most
disastrous
results
but
from
experience
we
come
to
a
very
different
conclusion
bishop
dupanloup
indeed
spoke
of
the
public
schools
of
france
as
this
is
not
what
is
said
or
thought
of
the
english
schools
and
they
are
filled
with
boys
whose
fathers
and
grandfathers
were
brought
up
in
them
and
desire
above
all
things
to
maintain
the
old
traditions
the
little
schools
of
aimed
at
training
a
few
boys
very
differently
each
master
had
the
charge
of
five
or
six
only
and
these
were
never
to
be
out
of
his
presence
day
or
night
it
may
reasonably
be
objected
that
such
schools
would
be
possible
only
for
a
few
children
of
parents
and
that
men
who
would
thus
devote
themselves
could
be
found
only
at
seasons
of
great
enthusiasm
under
ordinary
circumstances
small
schools
have
most
of
the
drawbacks
and
few
of
the
advantages
which
are
to
be
found
in
large
schools
as
i
have
already
said
parents
schoolmasters
and
have
separate
functions
in
education
and
even
in
the
smallest
school
the
master
can
never
take
the
place
of
the
parent
or
the
school
become
the
home
children
at
home
enter
into
the
world
of
their
father
and
mother
the
family
friends
are
friends
the
family
events
affect
them
as
a
matter
of
course
but
in
the
school
however
small
the
interests
are
unconnected
with
the
master
and
the
family
the
boys
may
be
on
the
most
intimate
even
affectionate
terms
with
the
grown
people
who
have
charge
of
them
but
the
mental
horizon
of
the
two
parties
is
very
different
and
their
common
area
of
vision
but
small
in
such
cases
the
young
do
not
rise
into
the
world
of
the
adults
and
it
is
almost
impossible
for
the
adults
to
descend
into
theirs
they
are
the
one
for
the
other
and
to
be
constantly
in
each
presence
would
subject
both
to
very
irksome
restraint
when
left
to
themselves
boys
in
small
numbers
are
far
more
likely
to
get
into
harm
than
boys
in
large
numbers
in
large
communities
even
of
boys
common
sense
of
is
a
check
on
the
badly
disposed
so
as
it
seems
to
me
if
from
any
cause
the
young
can
not
live
at
home
and
attend
a
they
will
be
far
better
off
in
a
large
boarding
school
than
in
one
that
would
better
fulfil
the
requirements
of
erasmus
and
locke
as
attributed
immense
importance
to
the
part
of
the
master
in
education
he
was
not
easily
satisfied
with
his
qualifications
is
no
occupation
in
the
church
that
is
more
worthy
of
a
christian
next
to
giving
up
life
there
is
no
greater
charity
the
charge
of
the
soul
of
one
of
these
little
ones
is
a
higher
employment
than
the
government
of
all
the
cadet
so
thought
and
he
was
ready
to
go
to
the
ends
of
the
earth
to
find
the
sort
of
teacher
he
wanted
he
was
so
anxious
that
the
children
should
see
only
that
which
was
good
that
the
servants
were
chosen
with
peculiar
care
for
the
masters
his
favourite
rule
was
little
put
up
with
much
pray
still
piety
was
not
to
be
instilled
so
much
by
precepts
as
by
the
atmosphere
in
which
the
children
grew
up
not
spend
so
much
time
in
speaking
to
them
about
god
as
to
god
about
them
so
formal
instruction
was
never
to
be
made
wearisome
but
there
was
to
be
an
incessant
watch
against
evil
influences
and
for
good
guarding
the
citadel
says
lancelot
fail
if
we
leave
open
a
single
gateway
by
which
the
enemy
might
though
anxious
like
the
jesuits
to
make
their
studies
only
endurable
but
even
delightful
the
gentlemen
of
banished
every
form
of
rivalry
each
pupil
was
to
think
of
one
whom
he
should
try
to
catch
up
but
this
was
not
a
but
his
own
higher
self
his
ideal
here
pascal
admits
that
the
exclusion
of
competition
had
its
drawbacks
and
that
the
boys
sometimes
became
dans
la
nonchalance
as
he
says
as
for
the
instruction
it
was
founded
on
this
principle
the
object
of
schools
being
piety
rather
than
knowledge
there
was
to
be
no
pressure
in
studying
but
the
children
were
to
be
taught
what
was
sound
and
enduring
in
all
occupations
there
is
of
necessity
a
tradition
in
the
higher
callings
the
tradition
may
be
of
several
kinds
first
there
may
be
a
tradition
of
noble
thoughts
and
high
ideals
which
will
be
conveyed
in
the
words
of
the
greatest
men
who
have
been
engaged
in
that
calling
or
have
thought
out
the
theory
of
it
next
there
will
be
the
tradition
of
the
very
best
workers
in
it
and
lastly
there
is
the
tradition
of
the
common
man
who
learns
and
passes
on
just
the
ordinary
views
of
his
class
and
the
ordinary
expedients
for
getting
through
ordinary
work
of
these
different
kinds
of
tradition
the
has
always
shown
a
tendency
to
keep
to
this
last
and
the
common
man
is
supreme
young
teachers
are
mostly
required
to
fulfil
their
daily
tasks
without
the
smallest
preparation
for
them
so
they
have
to
get
through
as
best
they
can
and
have
no
time
to
think
of
any
high
ideal
or
of
any
way
of
doing
their
work
except
that
which
gives
them
least
trouble
makes
perfect
says
the
proverb
but
it
would
be
truer
to
say
that
practice
in
doing
work
badly
soon
makes
perfect
in
contentment
with
bad
workmanship
thus
it
is
that
the
tradition
of
the
settles
down
for
the
most
part
into
a
deadly
routine
and
teachers
who
have
long
been
engaged
in
carrying
it
on
seem
to
lose
their
powers
of
vision
like
horses
who
turn
mills
in
the
dark
the
gentlemen
of

free
from
tradition
the
want
of
emulation
was
a
drawback

they
wished
to
the

of
their
pupils
to
the
highest
point
they
could
attain
in
doing
this
they
profited
by
their
freedom
from
routine
to
try
experiments
they
used
their
own
judgments
and
sought
to
train
the
judgment
of
their
pupils
themselves
knowing
the
delights
of
literature
they
resolved
that
their
pupils
should
know
them
also
they
would
banish
all
useless
difficulties
and
do
what
they
could
to
the

one
of
their
innovations
though
startling
to
their
contemporaries
does
not
seem
to
us
very
surprising
it
was
the
custom
to
begin
reading
with
a
three
or
four
course
of
reading
latin
because
in
that
language
all
the
letters
were
pronounced
the
connexion
between
sound
and
sense
is
in
our
days
not
always
thought
of
but
even
among
teachers
no
advocates
would
now
be
found
for
the
old
method
which
kept
young
people
for
the
first
three
or
four
years
uttering
sounds
they
could
by
no
possibility
understand
the
french
language
might
have
some
disadvantage
from
its
silent
letters
but
this
was
small
compared
with
the
disadvantage
felt
in
latin
from
its
silent
sense
so
the
began
reading
with
french
further
than
this
they
objected
to
reading
through
spelling
and
pointed
out
that
as
consonants
can
not
be
pronounced
by
themselves
they
should
be
taken
only
in
connexion
with
the
adjacent
vowel
pascal
applied
himself
to
the
subject
and
invented
the
method
described
in
the
chap
of
the
general
grammar
carré
xxiij
and
introduced
by
his
sister
jacqueline
at
des
champs
when
the
child
could
read
french
the
gentlemen
of
sought
for
him
books
within
the
range
of
his
intelligence
there
was
nothing
suitable
in
french
so
they
set
to
work
to
produce
translations
in
good
french
of
the
most
readable
latin
books
them
just
a

fort

as
said
the
chief
translator
de

for
the
sake
of
purity
in
this
way
they
gallicised
the
fables
of
phædrus
three
comedies
of
terence
and
the
familiar
letters
of
cicero
in
this
we
see
an
important
innovation
as
i
have
tried
to
explain
pp
ff
the
effect
of
the
renascence
was
to
banish
both
the
and
literature
proper
from
the
for
no
language
was
tolerated
but
latin
and
no
literature
was
thought
possible
except
in
latin
or
greek
before
any
literature
could
be
known
or
indeed
instruction
in
any
subject
could
be
given
the
pupils
had
to
learn
latin
this
neglect
of
the
was
one
of
the
traditional
mistakes
pointed
out
and
abandoned
by
the
of
quality
complain
says
de

complain
with
reason
that
in
giving
their
children
latin
we
take
away
french
and
to
turn
them
into
citizens
of
ancient
rome
we
make
them
strangers
in
their
native
land
after
learning
latin
and
greek
for
or
years
we
are
often
obliged
at
the
age
of
to
learn
cadet
so
proposed
breaking
through
this
bondage
to
latin
and
laid
down
the
principle
new
in
france
though
not
in
the
country
of
mulcaster
or
of
ratke
that
everything
should
be
taught
through
the
next
the
sought
to
give
their
pupils
an
early
and
a
pleasing
introduction
to
literature
the
best
literature
in
those
days
was
the
classical
and
suitable
works
from
that
literature
might
be
made
intelligible
means
of
in
this
way
the
led
their
pupils
to
look
upon
some
of
the
classical
authors
not
as
inventors
of
examples
in
syntax
but
as
writers
of
books
that
something
and
thus
both
the
and
literature
were
brought
into
the
when
the
boys
had
by
this
means
got
some
feeling
for
literature
and
some
acquaintance
with
the
world
of
the
ancients
they
began
the
study
of
latin
here
again
all
needless
difficulties
were
taken
out
of
their
way
no
attempt
indeed
was
made
to
teach
language
without
grammar
the
rationale
of
language
but
the
science
of
grammar
was
reduced
to
first
principles
set
forth
in
the
générale
et
of
arnauld
and
lancelot
and
the
special
grammar
of
the
latin
language
was
no
longer
taught
by
means
of
the
work
established
in
the
university
the
latin
grammar
of
despautère
but
by
a
written
in
french
which
gave
essentials
only
and
had
for
its
motto
inter
virtutes
grammatici
habebitur
aliqua
me
it
will
be
among
the
good
points
not
to
know
quintil
with
this
minimum
of
the
essentials
of
the
grammar
and
with
a
previous
acquaintance
with
the
sense
of
the
book
the
pupils
were
introduced
to
the
latin
language
and
were
taught
to
translate
a
latin
author
into
french
this
was
a
departure
from
the
ordinary
route
which
after
a
course
of
learning
in
latin
went
to
the
to
composition
in
latin
the
art
of
translating
into
the
was
made
much
of
school
which
consist
in
substituting
a
word
for
a
word
were
entirely
forbidden
and
the
pupils
had
to
produce
the
old
thoughts
from
this
we
see
that
the
training
was
literary
but
in
the
study
of
form
the
did
not
neglect
the
inward
for
the
outward
their
great
work
which
still
stands
the
attacks
of
time
is

or
the
art
of

spencer
baynes
this
was
substantially
the
work
of
arnauld
and
it
was
arnauld
who
led
the
in
their
rupture
with
the
philosophy
of
the
middle
age
and
who
openly
followed
descartes
in
the
we
find
the
claims
of
reason
asserted
as
if
in
defiance
of
the
jesuits
is
a
heavy
bondage
to
think
oneself
forced
to
agree
in
everything
with
aristotle
and
to
take
him
as
the
standard
of
truth
in
philosophy
the
world
can
not
long
continue
in
this
restraint
and
is
recovering
by
degrees
its
natural
and
reasonable
liberty
which
consists
in
accepting
that
which
we
judge
to
be
true
and
rejecting
that

we

to
be

their
scholars
they
paid
great
attention
to

loved

that

love
it
also
and
with
this
end
they
would
give
the
first

the
love
of

still

making

any

he

us
with
what
thought
and

he
had
applied
himself
to
the
art
of
instruction
and
he
gives
us
hints
that
all
teachers
may
profit
by
take
the
following
speaking
it
is
not
the
masters
it
is
no
instruction
from
without
that
makes
things
understood
at
the
best
the
masters
do
nothing
but
expose
the
things
to
the
interior
light
of
the
mind
by
which
alone
they
can
be
understood
it
follows
that
where
this
light
is
wanting
instruction
is
as
useless
as
trying
to
shew
pictures
in
the
dark
the
very
greatest
minds
are
nothing
but
lights
in
confinement
and
they
have
always
sombre
and
shady
spots
but
in
children
the
mind
is
nearly
full
of
shade
and
emits
but
little
rays
of
light
so
everything
depends
on
making
the
most
of
these
rays
on
increasing
them
and
exposing
to
them
what
one
wishes
to
have
understood
for
this
reason
it
is
hard
to
give
general
rules
for
instructing
anyone
because
the
instruction
must
be
adapted
to
the
mixture
of
light
and
darkness
which
differs
widely
in
different
minds
especially
with
children
we
must
look
where
the
day
is
breaking
and
bring
to
it
what
we
wish
them
to
understand
and
to
do
this
we
must
try
a
variety
of
ways
for
getting
at
their
minds
and
must
persevere
with
such
as
we
find
have
most
success
generally
speaking
we
may
say
that
as
in
children
the
light
depends
greatly
on
their
senses
we
should
as
far
as
possible
attach
to
the
senses
the
instruction
we
give
them
and
make
it
enter
not
only
by
the
ear
but
also
by
the
sight
as
there
is
no
sense
which
makes
so
lively
an
impression
on
the
mind
and
forms
such
sharp
and
clear
this
is
excellent
there
is
a
wise
proverb
that
warns
us
that
soon
we
get
up
in
the
morning
the
sunrise
comes
never
the
a
vast
amount
of
instruction
is
thrown
away
because
the
instructors
will
not
wait
for
the
for
the
moral
training
of
the
young
there
is
one
qualification
in
the
teacher
which
is
absolutely
similarly
for
the
intellectual
training
there
is
an
indispensable
this
is
the
qualification
required
by
the
system
of
but
not
required
in
working
the
ordinary
machinery
of
the
either
in
those
days
or
in
ours
when
nicole
has
described
how
instruction
should
be
given
so
as
to
train
the
judgment
and
cultivate
the
taste
he
continues
this
kind
of
instruction
comes
without
observation
so
is
the
profit
derived
from
it
likely
to
escape
observation
also
that
is
it
will
not
announce
itself
by
anything
on
the
surface
and
palpable
to
the
common
man
and
on
this
account
persons
of
small
intelligence
are
mistaken
about
it
and
think
that
a
boy
thus
instructed
is
no
better
than
another
because
he
can
not
make
a
better
translation
from
latin
into
french
or
beat
him
in
saying
his
virgil
thus
judging
of
the
instruction
by
these
trifles
only
they
often
make
less
account
of
a
really
able
teacher
than
of
one
of
little
science
and
of
a
mind
without

in

seem

it
must
be
all
right
if
the
children
can
stand
the
tests
of
the
examiner
or
the
inspector
something
may
no
doubt
be
got
at
by
these
tests
but
we
can
not
hope
for
any
genuine
care
for
education

the
improved
methods

his
colleagues

that

said
applies
only
to
classical

to
literary
instruction

some
of
his
advice
will
be
good
for
all
teachers
as
long
as
the
human
mind
needs
instruction
i
have
met
with
nothing
that
seems
to
me
to
go
more
truly
to
the
very
foundation
of
the
art
of
teaching
than
the
following
should
never
lose
sight
of
this
grand
principle
that
study
depends
on
the
will
and
the
will
does
not
endure
constraint

quint

we
can
to
be
sure
put
constraint
on
the
body
and
make
a
pupil
however
unwilling
stick
to
his
desk
can
double
his
toil
by
punishment
compel
him
to
finish
a
task
imposed
upon
him
and
with
this
object
we
can
deprive
him
of
play
and
recreation
but
is
this
work
of
the
studying
and
what
remains
to
the
pupil
from
this
kind
of
study
but
a
hatred
of
books
of
learning
and
of
masters
often
till
the
end
of
his
days
it
is
then
the
will
that
we
must
draw
on
our
side
and
this
we
must
do
by
gentleness
by
friendliness
by
persuasion

by

allurement
of

x
the
passage
i
have
quoted
is
from
the
giving
a
taste
for
study
and
if
some
masters
do
not
agree
that
this
is
of
the
most
important
points
concerning
education
they
will
not
deny
that
is
at
the
same
time
one
of
the
most
as
rollin
truly
says
a
very
great
number
of
masters
who
in
other
respects
are
highly
meritorious
there
will
be
found
very
few
who
manage
to
get
their
pupils
to
like
their
one
of
the
great
causes
of
the
disinclination
for
school
work
is
to
be
found
according
to
rollin
and
quintilian
in
the
repulsive
form
in
which
children
first
become
acquainted
with
the
elements
of
learning
this
matter
success
depends
very
much
on
first
impressions
and
the
main
effort
of
the
masters
who
teach
the
first
rudiments
should
be
so
to
do
this
that
the
child
who
can
not
as
yet
love
study
should
at
least
not
get
an
aversion
for
it
from
that
time
forward
for
fear
lest
the
bitter
taste
once
acquired
should
still
be
in
his
mouth
when
he
grows
begin
of
art
x
as
above
in
this
matter
rollin
was
more
truly
the
disciple
of
the
than
of
quintilian
they
it
was
who
protested
against
the
dismal
of
learning
to
read
first
in
an
unknown
tongue
and
of
studying
the
rules
of
latin
in
latin
with
no
knowledge
of
latin
a
course
which
professed
to
lead
as
puts
it
the
unknown
through
the
they
directed
their
intellects
to
the
teaching
of
the
elements
and
succeeded
in
proving
that
the
ordinary
difficulties
were
due
not
to
the
dulness
of
the
learners
but
to
the
stupidity
of
the
masters
they
showed
how
much
might
be
done
to
remove
these
difficulties
by
following
not
routine
but
the
dictates
of
thought
and
study
and
love
of
the
little
ones

it
is
only

probable
that
i
have
not
given
to

the
attention
due
to
him
xii
some
english
writers
before
locke
the
beginning
of
the
century
brought
with
it
a
change
in
the
main
direction
of
thought
and
interest
as
we
have
seen
the
century
adored
literature
and
was
thrown
back
on
the
remote
past
some
of
the
great
scholars
like
sturm
had
indeed
visions
of
literary
works
to
be
written
that
would
rival
the
old
models
on
which
they
were
fashioned
but
whether
they
hoped
or
not
to
bring
back
the
golden
age
all
the
scholars
of
the
renascence
thought
of
it
as
with
the
change
of
century
however
a
new
conception
came
into
minds
might
not
this
worship
of
the
old
writers
after
all
be
somewhat
of
a
superstition
the
languages
in
which
they
wrote
were
beautiful
languages
no
doubt
but
they
were
ill
adapted
to
express
the
ideas
and
wants
of
the
modern
world
as
for
the
substance
of
these
old
writings
this
did
not
satisfy
the
cravings
of
minds
it
left
unsolved
all
the
main
problems
of
existence
and
offered
for
knowledge
mere
speculations
or
poetic
fancies
or
polished
rhetoric
man
needed
to
understand
his
position
with
regard
to
god
and
to
nature
but
on
both
of
these
topics
the
classics
were
either
silent
or
misleading
revelation
had
supplied
what
the
classics
could
not
give
concerning
relation
to
god
but
nothing
had
as
yet
thrown
light
on
his
relation
to
nature
and
yet
with
his
material
body
and
animal
life
he
could
not
but
see
how
close
that
relation
was
and
could
not
but
wish
that
something
about
it
might
be
not
simply
guessed
or
feigned
hence
the
demand
for
knowledge
that
is
a
knowledge
of
the
facts
of
the
universe
as
distinct
from
the
knowledge
of
what
men
have
thought
and
said
we
have
heard
of
the
mathematician
who
put
down
paradise
lost
with
the
remark
that
it
seemed
to
him
a
poor
book
for
it
did
not
prove
anything
and
it
was
just
in
this
spirit
that
the
new
school
of
thinkers
the
realists
looked
upon
the
classics
they
wanted
to
know
laws
and
words
which
did
not
convey
such
knowledge
seemed
to
them
of
little
value
here
was
a
tremendous
revolution
from
the
mode
of
thought
prevalent
in
the
renascence
no
longer
was
the
golden
age
in
the
past
in
science
the
golden
age
must
always
be
in
the
future
scientific
men
start
with
what
has
been
discovered
and
add
to
it
every
discovery
passes
into
the
common
stock
of
knowledge
and
becomes
the
property
of
everyone
who
knows
it
just
as
much
as
of
the
discoverer
harvey
had
no
more
property
in
the
circulation
of
the
blood
newton
and
leibnitz
no
more
property
in
the
differential
calculus
than
columbus
in
the
continent
of
america
indeed
not
so
much
for
columbus
gained
some
exclusive
rights
in
america
but
harvey
gained
none
over
the
blood
so
we
see
that
whereas
the
literary
spirit
made
the
dominant
minds
reverence
the
past
the
scientific
spirit
led
them
to
despise
the
past
and
whereas
the
literary
spirit
raised
the
value
of
words
and
led
to
the
study
of
celebrated
writings
the
scientific
spirit
was
totally
careless
about
words
and
prized
only
physical
truths
which
were
entirely
independent
of
words
again
the
literary
spirit
naturally
favoured
the
principle
of
authority
for
its
oracles
had
already
spoken
the
scientific
spirit
set
aside
all
authority
and
accepted
nothing
that
did
not
of
itself
satisfy
the
reason
compare
comenius
p
the
first
great
leader
in
this
revolution
was
an
englishman
francis
bacon
but
the
felt
his
influence
only
through
those
who
learnt
from
him
and
among
educational
reformers
the
chief
advocates
of
realism
have
been
found
on
the
continent
ratke
and
comenius
but
the
desire
to
learn
by
not
affected
the
minds
of
many
english
writers
on
education
and
we
find
this
spirit
showing
itself
even
in
milton
and
locke
and
far
more
clearly
in
some
writers
less
known
to
fame
there
is
a
wide
distinction
in
educational
writers
between
those
who
were
schoolmasters
and
those
who
were
not
schoolmasters
have
to
come
to
terms
with
what
exists
and
to
make
a
livelihood
by
it
so
they
are
conservatives
by
position
and
rarely
get
beyond
an
attempt
at
showing
how
that
which
is
now
done
badly
might
be
done
well
suggestions
of
radical
change
usually
come
from
those
who
never
belonged
to
the
class
of
teachers
or
who
not
without
disgust
have
left
it
among
english
schoolmasters
of
the
olden
times
the
chief
writers
i
have
met
with
besides
mulcaster
are
john
brinsley
the
elder
and
charles
hoole
john
brinsley
the
elder
a
puritan
schoolmaster
at
a
of
bishop
and
father
of
john
brinsley
the
younger
who
became
a
leading
puritan
minister
and
author
was
a
veritable
reformer
but
only
with
reference
to
methods
his
most
interesting
books
are
literarius
or
the
grammar
written
after
experience
in
teaching
as
we
learn
from
the
and
consolation
for
our
grammar
schooles
or
a
faithfull
and
most
comfortable
incouragement
for
laying
of
a
sure
foundation
of
all
good
learning
in
our
schooles
and
for
prosperous
building
the
first
of
these
when
reprinted
as
it
is
sure
to
be
will
always
secure
for
its
author
the
notice
and
the
gratitude
of
students
of
the
history
of
our
education
for
in
this
book
he
tells
us
not
only
what
should
be
done
in
the
but
also
what
was
done
in
a
dialogue
with
the
ordinary
schoolmaster
the
reformer
draws
to
light
the
usual
practice
criticizes
it
and
suggests
improvements
in
brinsley
we
get
no
hint
of
realism
but
by
the
middle
of
the
sixteen
hundreds
we
find
the
realistic
spirit
is
felt
even
by
a
schoolmaster
charles
hoole
who
was
a
kinsman
of
bishop
sanderson
the
casuist
and
was
master
first
of
the
grammar
school
at
rotherham
then
of
a
private
grammar
school
in
london
published
besides
a
number
of
school
books
a
translation
of
the
date
of
preface
january
and
also
new
discovery
of
the
old
art
of
teaching
schoole
published
for
the
general
profit
especially
of
young
date
of
preface
december
in
these
books
we
find
that
hoole
succeeded
even
in
the
in
keeping
his
mind
open
he
complains
of
the
neglect
of
english
and
evidently
in
theory
at
least
went
a
long
way
with
the
realistic
reformers
he
says
proceeded
as
nature
itself
doth
in
an
orderly
way
first
to
exercise
the
senses
well
by
presenting
their
objects
to
them
and
then
to
fasten
upon
the
intellect
by
impressing
the
first
notions
of
things
upon
it
and
linking
them
one
to
another
by
a
rational
discourse
whereas
indeed
we
generally
missing
this
way
do
teach
children
as
we
do
parrots
to
speak
they
know
not
what
nay
which
is
worse
we
taking
the
way
of
teaching
little
ones
by
grammar
only
at
the
first
do
puzzle
their
imaginations
with
abstractive
terms
and
secondary
intentions
which
till
they
be
somewhat
acquainted
with
things
and
the
words
belonging
to
them
in
the
language
which
they
learn
they
can
not
apprehend
what
they
mean
and
this
i
guess
to
be
the
reason
why
many
greater
persons
do
resolve
sometimes
not
to
put
a
child
to
school
till
he
be
at
least
eleven
or
twelve
years
of
age
you
then
that
have
the
care
of
little
children
do
not
too
much
trouble
their
thoughts
and
clog
their
memories
with
bare
grammar
rudiments
which
to
them
are
harsh
in
getting
and
fluid
in
retaining
because
indeed
to
them
they
signifie
nothing
but
a
meer
swimming
notion
of
a
general
term
which
they
know
not
what
it
meaneth
till
they
comprehend
all
particulars
but
by
this
the
or
the
like
subsidiarie
inform
them
first
with
some
knowledge
of
things
and
words
wherewith
to
express
them
and
then
their
rules
of
speaking
will
be
better
understood
and
more
firmly
kept
in
mind
else
how
should
a
child
conceive
what
a
rule
meaneth
when
he
neither
knoweth
what
the
latine
word
importeth
nor
what
manner
of
thing
it
is
which
is
signified
to
him
in
his
own
native
language
which
is
given
him
thereby
to
understand
the
rule
for
rules
consisting
of
generalities
are
delivered
as
i
may
say
at
a
third
hand
presuming
first
the
things
and
then
the
words
to
be
already
apprehended
touching
which
they
are
this
subject
hoole
wisely
commends
to
the
consideration
of
teachers
being
very
basis
of
our
profession
to
search
into
the
way
of
taking
hold
by
little
and
little
of
what
we
teach
that
so
we
may
apply
ourselves
to
their
preface
to
trans
of
lord
how
many
good
and
clear
wits
of
children
be
perished
by
ignorant
schoolmasters
so
said
sir
thomas
elyot
in
his
in
and
the
complaint
would
not
have
been
out
of
date
in
the
century
possibly
not
in
the
in
the
sixteen
hundreds
we
certainly
find
little
advance
in
practice
though
in
theory
many
bold
projects
were
advanced
some
of
which
pointed
to
the
study
of
things
to
the
training
of
the
hand
and
even
to
observation
of
the
the
poet
for
the
advancement
of
experimental
is
a
scheme
of
a
college
near
london
to
which
is
to
be
attached
a
school
of
boys
because
it
is
deplorable
to
consider
the
loss
which
children
make
of
their
time
at
most
schools
employing
or
rather
casting
away
six
or
seven
years
in
the
learning
of
words
only
and
that
too
very
imperfectly
that
a
method
be
here
established
for
the
infusing
knowledge
and
language
at
the
same
time
is
this
an
echo
of
comenius
and
that
this
may
be
their
apprenticeship
in
natural
rarely
indeed
have
those
who
either
theoretically
or
practically
have
made
a
study
of
education
ever
acquired
sufficient
literary
skill
to
catch
the
ear
of
the
public
or
what
is
at
least
as
difficult
the
ear
of
the
teaching
body
and
among
the
eminent
writers
who
have
spoken
on
education
as
rabelais
montaigne
milton
locke
rousseau
herbert
spencer
we
can
not
find
one
who
has
given
to
it
more
than
passing
if
not
accidental
attention
schoolmasters
are
as
i
said
conservative
at
least
in
the
and
moreover
they
seldom
find
the
necessary
time
money
or
inclination
for
publishing
on
the
work
of
their
calling
the
current
thought
at
any
period
must
then
be
gathered
from
books
only
to
be
found
in
our
great
libraries
books
in
which
writers
now
long
forgotten
give
hints
of
what
was
wanted
out
of
the
and
grumble
at
what
went
on
in
it
one
of
the
most
original
of
these
writers
that
have
come
in
my
way
is
john
dury
a
puritan
who
was
at
one
time
chaplain
to
the
english
company
of
merchants
at
elbing
and
laboured
with
comenius
and
hartlib
to
promote
unity
among
the
various
christian
bodies
of
the
reformed
faith
see
of
vol
iii
about
dury
published
reformed
which
gives
the
scheme
of
an
association
for
the
purpose
of
educating
a
number
of
boys
and
girls
a
christian
that
dury
was
not
himself
a
schoolmaster
is
plain
from
the
first
of
his
of
chief
rule
of
the
whole
work
is
that
nothing
be
made
tedious
and
grievous
to
the
children
but
all
the
toilsomeness
of
their
business
the
governor
and
ushers
are
to
take
upon
themselves
that
by
diligence
and
industry
all
things
may
be
so
prepared
methodized
and
ordered
for
their
apprehension
that
this
work
may
unto
them
be
as
a
delightful
recreation
by
the
variety
and
easiness
things
to
be
looked
unto
in
the
care
of
their
education
he
enumerates
in
the
order
of
importance
their
advancement
in
piety
the
preservation
of
their
health
the
forming
of
their
manners
their
proficiency
in
and
bodily
health
are
absolutely
necessary
says
dury
one
for
spiritual
and
the
other
for
their
temporal
so
great
care
is
to
be
taken
in
their
bodies
in
husbandry
or
manufactures
or
military
about
instruction
we
find
the
usual
complaints
which
like
truth
keep
constant
says
dury
taught
to
read
authors
and
learn
words
and
sentences
before
they
can
have
any
notion
of
the
things
signified
by
those
words
and
sentences
or
of
the
strain
and
wit
in
setting
them
together
and
they
are
made
to
learn
by
heart
the
generall
rules
sentences
and
precepts
of
arts
before
they
are
furnished
with
any
matter
whereunto
to
apply
those
rules
and
dury
would
entirely
sweep
away
the
old
routine
and
in
all
instruction
he
would
keep
in
view
the
following
end
true
end
of
all
human
learning
is
to
supply
in
ourselves
and
others
the
defects
which
proceed
from
our
ignorance
of
the
nature
and
use
of
the
creatures
and
the
disorderliness
of
our
natural
faculties
in
using
them
and
reflecting
upon
natural
dury
struck
a
new
note
which
has
now
become
the
keynote
in
the
science
of
education
he
enforces
his
point
with
the
following
ingenious
illustration
in
a
watch
one
wheel
rightly
set
doth
with
its
teeth
take
hold
of
another
and
sets
that
towards
a
third
and
so
all
move
one
by
another
when
they
are
in
their
right
places
for
the
end
for
which
the
watch
is
made
so
is
it
with
the
faculties
of
the
human
nature
being
rightly
ordered
to
the
ends
for
which
god
hath
created
them
but
contrariwise
if
the
wheels
be
not
rightly
set
or
the
watch
not
duly
wound
up
it
is
useless
to
him
that
hath
it
and
so
it
is
with
the
faculties
of
man
if
his
wheels
be
not
rightly
ordered
and
wound
up
by
the
ends
of
sciences
in
their
subordination
leading
him
to
employ
the
same
according
to
his
capacity
to
make
use
of
the
creatures
for
that
whereunto
god
hath
made
them
he
becomes
not
only
useless
but
even
a
burthen
and
hurtful
unto
himself
and
others
by
the
misusing
of
in
nature
sense
is
the
servant
of
imagination
imagination
of
memory
memory
of
reason
so
in
teaching
arts
and
sciences
we
must
set
these
faculties
in
this
order
towards
their
proper
objects
in
everything
which
is
to
be
taught
whence
this
will
follow
that
as
the
faculties
of
soul
naturally
perfect
each
other
by
their
mutual
subordination
so
the
arts
which
perfect
those
faculties
should
be
gradually
suggested
and
the
objects
wherewith
the
faculties
are
to
be
conversant
according
to
the
rules
of
art
should
be
offered
in
that
order
which
is
answerable
to
their
proper
ends
and
uses
and
not
in
this
and
much
else
that
dury
says
we
see
a
firm
grasp
of
the
principle
that
the
instruction
given
should
be
regulated
by
the
gradual
development
of
the
faculties
the
three
sources
of
our
knowledge
says
he
sense
tradition
reason
and
sense
comes
first
or
sciences
which
may
be
learnt
by
mere
sense
should
not
be
learnt
any
other
faculties
break
forth
in
them
by
degrees
to
be
vigorous
with
their
years
and
the
growth
of
their
bodies
so
they
are
to
be
filled
with
objects
whereof
they
are
capable
and
plied
with
arts
whence
followeth
that
while
children
are
not
capable
of
the
acts
of
reasoning
the
method
of
filling
their
senses
and
imaginations
with
outward
objects
should
be
plied
nor
is
their
memory
at
this
time
to
be
charged
further
with
any
objects
than
their
imagination
rightly
ordered
and
fixed
doth
of
itself
impress
the
same
upon
after
speaking
of
the
common
abuse
of
general
rules
he
says
far
as
those
faculties
sense
imagination
and
memory
are
started
with
matters
of
observation
so
far
rules
may
be
given
to
direct
the
mind
in
the
use
of
the
same
and
no
arts
and
sciences
which
lead
us
to
reflect
upon
the
use
of
our
own
faculties
are
not
to
be
taught
till
we
are
fully
acquainted
with
their
proper
objects
and
the
direct
acts
of
the
faculties
about
so
is
a
very
absurd
and
preposterous
course
to
teach
logick
and
metaphysicks
before
or
with
other
humane
sciences
which
depend
more
upon
sense
and
imagination
than
in
all
this
it
seems
to
me
that
the
worthy
puritan
of
whom
nobody
but
barnard
and
professor
masson
has
ever
heard
has
truly
done
more
to
lay
a
foundation
for
the
art
of
teaching
than
his
famous
contemporaries
milton
and
locke
another
writer
of
that
day
better
known
than
dury
and
with
far
more
power
of
expression
was
sir
william
petty
he
is
the
who
in
an
epistle
his
honoured
friend
master
samuel
hartlib
set
down
his
concerning
the
advancement
of
real
this
letter
is
to
be
shown
only
those
few
that
are
reall
friends
to
the
designe
of
petty
sees
the
need
of
intercommunication
of
those
who
wish
to
advance
any
art
or
science
he
complains
that
wits
and
endeavours
of
the
world
are
as
so
many
scattered
coals
or
which
for
want
of
union
are
soon
quenched
whereas
being
but
laid
together
they
would
yield
a
comfortable
light
and
this
is
a
thought
which
may
well
be
applied
to
the
bringing
up
of
the
young
and
the
following
passage
might
have
been
written
to
secure
a
training
for
teachers
the
present
condition
of
men
is
like
a
field
where
a
battle
hath
been
lately
fought
where
we
may
see
many
legs
and
arms
and
eyes
lying
here
and
there
which
for
want
of
a
union
and
a
soul
to
quicken
and
enliven
them
are
good
for
nothing
but
to
feed
ravens
and
infect
the
air
so
we
see
many
wits
and
ingenuities
lying
scattered
up
and
down
the
world
whereof
some
are
now
labouring
to
do
what
is
already
done
and
puzzling
themselves
to
what
is
already
invented
others
we
see
quite
stuck
fast
in
difficulties
for
want
of
a
few
directions
which
some
other
man
might
he
be
met
withal
both
could
and
would
most
easily
give
i
wonder
how
many
young
teachers
are
now
wasting
their
own
and
their
time
in
this
awkward
predicament
for
education
says
petty
can
not
but
hope
that
those
who
make
it
their
trade
will
supply
it
and
render
the
idea
thereof
much
more
his
own
contributions
to
the
more
perfect
idea
consist
mainly
in
making
the
study
of
precede
literature
and
thus
announcing
the
principle
which
in
later
times
has
led
to
the
introduction
of
the
baconians
thought
that
the
good
time
was
at
hand
and
that
they
had
found
the
right
road
at
last
by
experiments
they
would
learn
to
interpret
nature
after
scheming
a
mechanicum
or
college
of
tradesmen
petty
says
experiments
and
stuff
would
all
those
shops
and
operations
afford
to
active
and
philosophical
heads
out
of
which
to
extract
that
interpretation
of
nature
whereof
there
is
so
little
and
that
so
bad
as
yet
extant
in
the
world
and
this
study
of
things
was
to
affect
the
work
of
the
and
redeem
it
from
the
dismal
state
into
which
it
was
fallen
for
the
studies
to
which
children
are
put
says
petty
are
altogether
unfit
for
want
of
judgment
which
is
but
weak
in
them
and
also
for
want
of
will
which
is
sufficiently
seen
by
the
difficulty
of
keeping
them
at
schools
and
the
punishment
they
will
endure
rather
than
be
altogether
debarred
from
the
pleasure
which
they
take
in
the
grand
reform
required
is
thus
set
forth
few
children
have
need
of
reading
before
they
know
or
can
be
acquainted
with
the
things
they
read
of
or
of
writing
before
their
thoughts
are
worth
the
recording
or
they
are
able
to
put
them
into
any
form
which
we
call
inditing
much
less
of
learning
languages
when
there
be
books
enough
for
their
present
use
in
their
own
our
opinion
is
that
those
things
being
withal
somewhat
above
their
capacity
as
being
to
be
attained
by
judgment
which
is
weakest
in
children
be
deferred
awhile
and
others
more
needful
for
them
such
as
are
in
the
order
of
nature
before
those
and
are
attainable
by
the
help
of
memory
which
is
either
most
strong
or
unpreoccupied
in
children
be
studied
before
them
we
wish
therefore
that
the
educands
be
taught
to
observe
and
remember
all
sensible
objects
and
actions
whether
they
be
natural
or
artificial
which
the
educators
must
upon
all
occasions
expound
unto
in
proposing
this
great
change
petty
was
influenced
not
merely
by
his
own
delight
in
the
study
of
things
but
by
something
far
more
important
for
education
by
observation
of
the
children
themselves
this
study
of
things
instead
of
rabble
of
would
be
easy
and
pleasant
to
the
young
as
the
more
suitable
to
the
natural
propensions
we
observe
in
them
for
we
see
children
do
delight
in
drums
pipes
fiddles
guns
made
of
elder
sticks
and
noses
piped
keys
painting
flags
and
ensigns
with
elderberries
and
cornpoppy
making
ships
with
paper
and
setting
even
handling
the
tools
of
workmen
as
soon
as
they
turn
their
backs
and
trying
to
work
themselves
fishing
fowling
hunting
setting
springes
and
traps
for
birds
and
other
animals
making
pictures
in
their
making
tops
gigs
and
whirligigs
gilting
balls
practising
divers
juggling
tricks
upon
the
cards
with
a
million
more
besides
and
for
the
females
they
will
be
making
pies
with
clay
making
their
clothes
and
dressing
them
therewith
they
will
spit
leaves
on
sticks
as
if
they
were
roasting
meat
they
will
imitate
all
the
talk
and
actions
which
they
observe
in
their
mother
and
her
gossips
and
punctually
act
the
comedy
or
the
tragedy
i
know
not
whether
to
call
it
of
a
by
all
which
it
is
most
evident
that
children
do
most
naturally
delight
in
things
and
are
most
capable
of
learning
them
having
quick
senses
to
receive
them
and
unpreoccupied
memories
to
retain
in
these
writers
dury
and
petty
we
find
a
wonderful
advance
in
the
theory
of
instruction
children
are
to
be
taught
about
and
this
because
their
inward
constitution
determines
them
towards
things
moreover
the
subjects
of
instruction
are
to
be
graduated
to
accord
with
the
development
of
the
faculties
the
giving
of
rules
and
incomprehensible
statements
that
will
come
in
useful
at
a
future
stage
is
entirely
forbidden
all
this
is
excellent
and
greatly
have
children
suffered
greatly
do
they
suffer
still
from
their
neglect
of
it
there
seems
to
me
to
have
been
no
important
advance
on
the
thought
of
these
men
till
pestalozzi
and
froebel
fixed
their
attention
on
the
mind
of
the
child
and
valued
things
not
in
themselves
but
simply
as
the
means
best
fitted
for
drawing
out
the
in
several
other
matters
we
find
sir
william
recommendations
in
advance
of
the
practice
of
his
own
time
and
ours
he
advises
the
business
of
education
be
not
as
now
committed
to
the
worst
and
unworthiest
of
men
here
at
least
we
have
improved
but
that
it
be
seriously
studied
and
practised
by
the
best
and
abler
to
this
standard
we
have
not
yet
attained
handwork
is
to
be
practised
but
its
educational
value
is
not
clearly
perceived
children
though
of
the
highest
rank
are
to
be
taught
some
gentle
manufacture
in
their
literary
workhouses
are
to
be
instituted
where
children
may
be
taught
as
well
to
do
something
towards
their
living
as
to
read
and
write
education
was
to
be
universal
but
chiefly
with
the
object
of
bringing
to
the
front
the
clever
sons
of
poor
parents
the
rule
he
would
lay
down
is
all
children
of
above
seven
years
old
may
be
presented
to
this
kind
of
education
none
being
to
be
excluded
by
reason
of
the
poverty
and
unability
of
their
parents
for
hereby
it
hath
come
to
pass
that
many
are
now
holding
the
plough
which
might
have
been
made
fit
to
steer
the
from
these
enthusiasts
for
realities
we
find
a
change
when
we
turn
to
their
contemporary
a
schoolmaster
and
author
of
a
latin
accidence
who
was
perhaps
the
most
notable
englishman
who
ever
kept
a
school
or
published
a
milton
was
not
only
a
great
poet
he
was
also
a
great
scholar
everything
he
said
or
wrote
bore
traces
of
his
learning
the
world
of
books
then
rather
than
the
world
of
the
senses
is
his
world
he
has
benefited
as
he
says
old
renowned
and
inclination
leads
him
to
read
modern
and
or
apparently
the
writings
of
any
of
his
contemporaries
including
those
of
his
great
countryman
bacon
but
as
professor
laurie
reminds
us
no
man
not
even
a
milton
however
he
may
ignore
the
originators
of
ideas
can
keep
himself
outside
the
influence
of
the
ideas
themselves
when
they
are
in
the
air
and
so
we
find
milton
using
his
incomparable
power
of
expression
in
the
service
of
the
realists
but
brief
he
endeavours
to
be
and
paying
the
horatian
penalty
he
becomes
obscure
in
the
observations
which
flowered
off
and
were
the
burnishing
of
many
studious
and
contemplative
years
milton
touches
only
on
the
bringing
up
of
sons
between
the
ages
of
and
and
his
suggestions
do
not
like
those
of
comenius
deal
with
the
education
of
the
people
or
of
both
sexes
this
limit
of
age
sex
and
station
deprives
plan
of
much
of
its
interest
as
the
absence
of
detail
deprives
it
of
much
of
its
value
still
we
find
in
the
a
very
great
advance
on
the
ideas
current
at
the
renascence
learning
is
no
longer
the
aim
of
education
but
is
regarded
simply
as
a
means
no
finer
expression
has
been
given
in
our
literature
to
the
main
thesis
of
the
christian
and
of
the
realist
and
to
the
contempt
of
verbalism
than
this
end
of
learning
is
to
repair
the
ruins
of
our
first
parents
by
regaining
to
know
god
aright
and
out
of
that
knowledge
to
love
him
to
imitate
him
to
be
like
him
as
we
may
the
nearest
by
possessing
our
souls
of
true
virtue
which
being
united
to
the
heavenly
grace
of
faith
makes
up
the
highest
perfection
but
because
our
understanding
can
not
in
this
body
found
itself
but
on
sensible
things
nor
arrive
so
clearly
to
the
knowledge
of
god
and
things
invisible
as
by
orderly
conning
over
the
visible
and
inferior
creature
the
same
method
is
necessarily
to
be
followed
in
all
discreet
teaching
and
seeing
every
nation
affords
not
experience
and
tradition
enough
for
all
kind
of
learning
therefore
we
are
chiefly
taught
the
languages
of
those
people
who
have
at
any
time
been
most
industrious
after
wisdom
so
that
language
is
but
the
instrument
conveying
to
us
things
useful
to
be
known
and
though
a
linguist
should
pride
himself
to
have
all
the
tongues
that
babel
cleft
the
world
into
yet
if
he
have
not
studied
the
solid
things
in
them
as
well
as
the
words
and
lexicons
he
were
nothing
so
much
to
be
esteemed
a
learned
man
as
any
yeoman
or
tradesman
competently
wise
in
his
the
several
propositions
here
implied
have
thus
been
by
professor
laurie
in
the
aim
of
education
is
the
of
god
and
to
god
to
god
we
attain
by
possessing
our
souls
of
true
virtue
and
by
the
heavenly
grace
of
faith
of
god
we
attain
by
the
study
of
the
visible
things
of
god
teaching
then
has
for
its
aim
knowledge
language
is
merely
an
instrument
or
vehicle
for
the
knowledge
of
things
the
linguist
may
be
less
educated
in
the
true
sense
than
a
man
who
can
make
good
use
of
his
though
he
knows
no
other
elsewhere
milton
gives
his
idea
of
complete
and
generous
education
it
a
man
to
perform
justly
skilfully
and
magnanimously
all
the
offices
both
private
and
public
of
peace
and
edition
p
here
and
indeed
in
all
that
milton
says
we
feel
that
noble
moral
glow
that
pervades
the
on
the
mood
of
magnanimity
in
which
it
is
conceived
and
written
and
the
faith
it
inculcates
in
the
powers
of
the
young
human
spirit
if
rightly
nurtured
and
directed
are
merits
masson
iij
p
but
in
this
moral
glow
and
in
an
intense
hatred
of
verbalism
lie
as
it
seems
to
me
the
chief
merits
of
the
tractate
the
practical
suggestions
are
either
incomprehensible
or
of
doubtful
wisdom
the
reforming
of
education
was
as
milton
says
one
of
the
greatest
and
noblest
designs
that
could
be
thought
on
but
he
does
not
take
the
right
road
when
he
proposes
for
every
city
in
england
a
joint
school
and
university
for
about
boarders
the
advice
to
keep
boys
between
and
in
this
barrack
life
i
consider
with
professor
laurie
to
be
unsound
and
the
project
of
uniting
the
military
training
of
sparta
with
the
humanistic
training
of
athens
seems
to
me
a
pure
chimæra
when
we
come
to
instruction
we
find
that
milton
after
announcing
the
distinctive
principle
of
the
realists
proves
to
be
himself
the
last
survivor
of
the
verbal
realists
see
p
no
doubt
daily
teachers
had
been
woods
and
rills
but
his
thoughts
had
been
even
more
in
his
books
and
for
the
young
he
sketches
out
a
purely
bookish
curriculum
the
young
are
to
learn
about
things
but
they
are
to
learn
through
books
and
the
only
books
to
which
milton
attaches
importance
are
written
in
latin
greek
or
hebrew
he
held
probably
with
good
reason
that
far
too
much
time
now
bestowed
in
pure
trifling
at
grammar
and
do
amiss
he
says
spend
or
years
merely
in
scraping
together
so
much
miserable
latin
and
greek
as
might
be
learned
otherwise
easily
and
delightfully
in
one
without
an
explanation
of
the
this
statement
is
a
truism
and
what
milton
says
further
hardly
amounts
to
an
explanation
his
plan
if
plan
it
can
be
called
is
as
follows
after
some
preparatory
grounds
of
speech
by
their
certain
forms
got
into
memory
the
boys
were
led
to
the
praxis
thereof
in
some
chosen
short
book
lessoned
thoroughly
to
them
they
might
then
proceed
to
learn
the
substance
of
good
things
and
arts
in
due
order
which
would
bring
the
whole
language
quickly
into
their
power
this
adds
milton
take
to
be
the
most
rational
and
most
profitable
way
of
learning
it
is
however
not
the
most
intelligible
doubt
not
but
ye
shall
have
more
ado
to
drive
our
dullest
and
laziest
youth
our
stocks
and
stubbs
from
the
infinite
desire
of
such
a
happy
nurture
than
we
have
now
to
hale
and
drag
our
choicest
and
hopefullest
wits
to
that
asinine
feast
of
sow
thistles
and
brambles
which
is
commonly
set
before
them
as
all
the
food
and
entertainment
of
their
tenderest
and
most
docible
we
can
not
but
wonder
whether
this
belief
survived
the
experience
of
pretty
in
from
the
little
we
are
told
by
his
nephew
and
old
pupil
edward
phillips
we
should
infer
that
milton
was
not
unsuccessful
as
a
schoolmaster
in
this
we
have
a
striking
proof
how
much
more
important
is
the
teacher
than
the
teaching
a
character
such
as
in
which
we
find
the
noblest
aims
united
with
untiring
energy
in
pursuit
of
them
could
not
but
dominate
the
impressionable
minds
of
young
people
brought
under
its
influence
but
whatever
success
he
met
with
could
not
have
been
due
to
the
things
he
taught
nor
to
his
method
in
teaching
them
in
spite
of
the
about
his
recommendations
they
are
a
bow
for
every
or
any
man
to
shoot
in
that
counts
himself
a
nor
did
he
do
much
for
the
science
of
education
his
scheme
is
vitiated
as
mark
pattison
says
by
information
in
the
literary
instruction
there
is
no
thought
of
training
the
faculties
of
all
or
the
special
faculties
of
the
individual
requires
much
observation
of
young
minds
to
discover
that
the
rapid
inculcation
of
unassimilable
information
stupefies
the
faculties
instead
of
training
them
says
pattison
and
milton
absorbed
by
his
own
thoughts
and
the
thoughts
of
the
ancients
did
not
observe
the
minds
of
the
young
and
knew
little
of
the
powers
of
any
mind
but
his
own
for
information
the
youths
are
not
required
to
observe
for
themselves
but
are
to
be
taught
general
compact
of
in
course
might
be
read
to
them
out
of
some
not
tedious
writer
the
institution
of
physick
that
they
may
know
the
tempers
the
humours
the
seasons
and
how
to
manage
a
even
the
study
of
the
classics
is
advocated
by
milton
on
false
grounds
if
like
the
he
had
recommended
the
study
of
the
classical
authors
for
the
sake
of
pure
latin
and
greek
or
as
models
of
literary
style
the
means
would
have
been
suited
to
the
end
but
it
was
very
different
when
he
directed
boys
to
study
virgil
and
columella
in
order
to
learn
about
bees
and
farming
in
they
would
find
these
authorities
a
little
out
of
date
and
if
they
ever
attempted
to
improve
tillage
recover
the
bad
soil
and
to
remedy
the
waste
that
is
made
of
good
which
was
one
of
praises
they
would
have
found
a
knowledge
of
the
methods
of
hercules
about
as
useful
as
of
the
methods
of
the
romans
milton
was
then
a
reformer
his
own
hand
and
notwithstanding
his
moral
and
intellectual
elevation
and
his
superb
power
of
rhetoric
he
seems
to
me
a
less
useful
writer
on
education
than
the
humble
puritans
whom
he
probably
would
not
deign
to
read
in
his
haughty
he
like
carlyle
with
whom
seeley
has
well
compared
him
and
addresses
addressed
his
contemporaries
haut
en
and
though
ready
to
teach
could
learn
only
among
the
old
renowned
authors
with
whom
he
associated
himself
and
we
associate
him
judged
from
our
present
standpoint
the
tractate
is
found
with
many
weaknesses
to
be
strong
in
this
that
it
physical
moral
mental
and
æsthetic
training
but
nothing
of
can
be
judged
by
our
ordinary
canons
he
soars
far
above
them
and
raises
us
with
him
mysterious
altitudes
above
the
whatever
we
little
people
may
say
about
the
suggestions
of
the
tractate
milton
will
remain
one
of
the
great
educators
of
mankind
xiii
locke
when
an
english
university
established
an
examination
for
future
teachers
the
first
set
were
and
the
selection
seems
to
me
a
very
happy
one
arnold
greatly
affected
the
spirit
and
even
the
organization
of
our
public
schools
at
a
time
when
the
old
schools
were
about
to
have
new
life
infused
into
them
and
when
new
schools
were
to
be
started
on
the
model
of
the
old
he
is
perhaps
the
greatest
educator
of
the
english
type
the
greatest
educator
who
had
accepted
the
system
handed
down
to
him
and
tried
to
make
the
best
of
it
locke
on
the
other
hand
whose
reputation
is
more
european
than
english
belongs
rather
to
the
continental
type
like
his
disciple
rousseau
and
like
disciples
the
french
revolutionists
locke
refused
the
traditional
system
and
appealed
from
tradition
and
authority
to
reason
we
english
revere
arnold
but
so
long
as
the
history
of
education
continues
to
be
written
as
it
has
been
written
hitherto
on
the
continent
the
only
englishman
celebrated
in
it
will
be
as
now
not
the
great
schoolmaster
but
the
great
philosopher
in
order
to
understand
locke
we
must
always
bear
in
mind
what
i
may
call
his
two
main
characteristics
his
craving
to
know
and
to
speak
the
truth
and
the
whole
truth
in
everything
truth
not
for
a
purpose
but
for
itself
his
perfect
trust
in
the
reason
as
the
guide
the
only
guide
to
truth
those
who
have
not
reflected
much
on
the
subject
will
naturally
suppose
that
the
desire
to
know
the
truth
is
common
to
all
men
and
the
desire
to
speak
the
truth
common
to
most
but
this
is
very
far
from
being
the
case
if
we
had
any
earnest
desire
for
truth
we
should
examine
things
carefully
before
we
admitted
them
as
truths
in
other
words
our
opinions
would
be
the
growth
of
long
and
energetic
thought
but
instead
of
this
they
are
formed
for
the
most
part
quite
carelessly
and
at
haphazard
and
we
value
them
not
on
account
of
their
supposed
agreement
with
fact
but
because
though
they
are
or
those
of
our
sect
or
party
locke
on
the
other
hand
was
always
endeavouring
to
get
at
the
truth
for
its
own
sake
this
separated
him
from
men
in
general
and
he
brought
great
powers
of
mind
to
bear
on
the
investigation
this
raised
him
above
them
second
characteristic
was
his
entire
reliance
on
the
guidance
of
reason
faculty
of
reasoning
says
he
or
never
deceives
those
who
trust
to
elsewhere
borrowing
a
metaphor
from
solomon
prov
xx
he
speaks
of
this
faculty
as
candle
of
the
lord
set
up
by
himself
in
b
in
a
fine
passage
in
the
of
the
he
calls
it
touchstone
of
iij
edition
he
even
goes
so
far
in
his
correspondence
with
molyneux
as
to
maintain
that
intelligent
honest
men
can
not
possibly
differ
but
if
we
consider
it
from
one
point
of
view
the
treatise
on
the
of
the
is
itself
a
witness
that
human
reason
is
a
compass
liable
to
incalculable
variations
and
likely
enough
to
shipwreck
those
who
steer
by
it
alone
in
this
book
locke
shows
us
that
to
come
to
a
true
result
the
understanding
must
be
perfectly
trained
must
not
be
affected
by
any
feeling
in
favour
of
or
against
any
particular
result
and
must
have
before
it
all
the
data
necessary
for
forming
a
judgment
in
practice
these
conditions
are
seldom
if
ever
fulfilled
and
locke
himself
when
he
wants
an
instance
of
a
mind
that
can
acquiesce
in
the
certainty
of
its
conclusions
takes
it
from
and
separate
spirits
who
may
be
endowed
with
more
comprehensive
than
we
are
of
u
iij
it
seems
to
me
then
that
locke
much
exaggerates
the
power
of
the
individual
reason
for
getting
at
the
truth
and
to
exaggerate
the
importance
of
one
function
of
the
mind
is
to
unduly
diminish
the
importance
of
the
rest
thus
we
find
that
in
scheme
of
education
little
thought
is
taken
for
the
play
of
the
affections
and
feelings
and
as
for
the
imagination
it
is
treated
merely
as
a
source
of
mischief
locke
as
it
has
often
been
pointed
out
differs
from
the
schoolmaster
in
making
small
account
of
the
knowledge
to
be
acquired
by
those
under
education
but
it
has
not
been
so
often
remarked
that
the
fundamental
difference
is
much
deeper
than
this
and
lies
in
the
conception
of
knowledge
itself
with
the
ordinary
schoolmaster
the
test
of
knowledge
is
the
power
of
reproduction
whatever
pupils
can
reproduce
with
difficulty
they
know
imperfectly
whatever
they
can
reproduce
with
ease
they
know
thoroughly
but
definition
of
knowledge
confines
it
to
a
much
smaller
area
according
to
him
knowledge
is
internal
perception
of
the
locke
to
stillingfleet
ij
is
seeing
and
if
it
be
so
it
is
madness
to
persuade
ourselves
we
do
so
by
another
eyes
let
him
use
never
so
many
words
to
tell
us
that
what
he
asserts
is
very
visible
till
we
ourselves
see
it
with
our
own
eyes
and
perceive
it
by
our
own
understandings
we
are
as
much
in
the
dark
and
as
void
of
knowledge
as
before
let
us
believe
any
learned
authors
as
much
as
we
of
u
here
locke
makes
no
distinction
between
different
classes
of
truths
but
surely
very
important
differences
exist
about
some
physical
facts
our
knowledge
is
at
once
most
certain
and
most
definite
when
we
derive
it
through
the
evidence
of
our
own
senses
is
believing
says
the
proverb
it
may
be
believing
but
it
is
not
knowing
that
certainty
which
we
call
knowledge
we
often
arrive
at
better
by
the
testimony
of
others
than
by
that
of
our
own
senses
miss
martineau
in
her
autobiography
tells
us
that
as
a
child
of
ten
she
entirely
and
unaccountably
failed
to
see
a
comet
which
was
visible
to
all
other
people
but
although
her
own
senses
were
at
fault
the
evidence
for
the
comet
was
so
conclusive
that
she
may
be
said
to
have
there
was
a
comet
in
the
sky
on
sufficient
evidence
we
can
know
anything
just
as
we
know
there
is
a
great
at
niagara
though
we
may
never
have
crossed
the
atlantic
but
we
can
not
be
so
certain
simply
on
the
evidence
of
our
senses
if
we
trusted
entirely
to
them
we
might
take
the
earth
for
a
plane
and
that
the
sun
moved
round
it
but
locke
probably
considers
as
the
subject
of
knowledge
not
so
much
physical
facts
as
the
great
body
of
truths
which
are
ascertained
by
the
intellect
it
is
the
eye
of
the
mind
by
which
alone
knowledge
is
to
be
gained
of
these
truths
the
purest
specimens
are
the
truths
of
geometry
it
may
be
said
that
only
those
who
have
followed
the
proofs
that
the
area
of
the
square
on
the
side
opposite
the
right
angle
in
a
triangle
is
equal
to
the
sum
of
the
squares
on
the
other
sides
but
even
in
pure
reasoning
like
this
the
tiro
often
seems
to
see
what
he
does
not
really
see
and
where
his
own
reason
brings
him
to
a
conclusion
different
from
the
one
established
he
only
that
he
is
mistaken
it
must
be
admitted
then
that
knowledge
knowledge
derived
from
the
vision
of
the
eye
or
of
the
mind
is
not
the
only
knowledge
the
young
require
every
learner
must
take
things
on
trust
as
even
lord
bacon
admits
credere
to
use
own
words
do
not
say
to
be
a
good
geographer
that
a
man
should
visit
every
mountain
river
promontory
and
creek
upon
the
face
of
the
earth
view
the
buildings
and
survey
the
land
everywhere
as
if
he
were
going
to
make
a
of
iij
so
that
even
according
to
own
shewing
we
must
use
the
eyes
of
others
as
well
as
our
own
and
this
is
true
not
in
geography
only
but
in
all
other
branches
of
knowledge
but
are
we
driven
to
the
alternative
of
agreeing
either
with
locke
or
with
the
schoolmaster
i
do
not
see
that
we
are
the
thought
which
underlies
system
of
education
is
this
true
knowledge
can
be
acquired
only
by
the
exercise
of
the
reason
in
childhood
the
reasoning
power
is
not
strong
enough
for
the
pursuit
of
knowledge
knowledge
therefore
is
out
of
the
question
at
that
age
and
the
only
thing
to
be
thought
of
is
the
formation
of
habits
opposed
to
this
we
have
the
ideal
which
is
governed
by
examinations
according
to
this
ideal
the
object
of
the
school
course
is
to
give
certain
linguistic
and
other
and
to
fix
it
in
the
memory
in
such
a
manner
that
it
can
be
displayed
on
the
day
of
examination
of
this
kind
often
makes
no
demand
whatever
on
the
reasoning
faculty
or
indeed
on
any
faculty
but
that
of
remembering
and
reproducing
what
the
learner
has
been
told
in
extreme
cases
the
memory
of
mere
sounds
or
symbols
suffices
but
after
all
we
are
not
compelled
to
choose
between
these
two
theories
take
the
subject
which
locke
has
mentioned
geography
the
schoolmasters
of
the
olden
time
began
with
the
use
of
the
globes
a
plan
which
by
the
way
locke
himself
seems
to
have
winked
at
his
disciple
molyneux
tells
him
of
the
performances
of
the
small
molyneux
when
he
was
but
just
turned
five
he
could
read
perfectly
well
and
on
the
globe
could
have
traced
out
and
pointed
at
all
the
noted
ports
countries
and
cities
of
the
world
both
land
and
sea
by
five
and
a
half
could
perform
many
of
the
plainest
problems
on
the
globe
as
the
longitude
and
latitude
the
antipodes
the
time
with
them
and
other
countries
molyneux
to
august
here
we
find
a
child
brought
up
without
any
protest
from
locke
on
mere
examination
knowledge
which
according
to
locke
himself
is
not
knowledge
at
all
it
is
strange
that
locke
did
not
at
once
point
out
to
molyneux
that
the
child
was
not
really
learning
what
the
father
supposed
him
to
be
learning
when
the
child
turned
over
the
plaster
ball
and
found
the
word
the
father
no
doubt
attributed
to
the
child
much
that
was
in
his
own
mind
only
to
the
child
as
rousseau
afterwards
said
was
nothing
but
a
plaster
ball
was
nothing
but
some
letters
marked
on
that
ball
comenius
had
already
got
a
notion
how
children
may
be
given
some
knowledge
of
geography
begin
geography
said
he
they
get
to
understand
what
a
hill
a
valley
a
field
a
river
a
village
a
town
p
when
this
beginning
has
been
made
geographical
knowledge
is
at
once
possible
to
the
child
and
not
before
perfect
knowledge
in
geography
as
in
most
other
things
is
out
of
every
reach
nobody
knows
all
that
could
be
known
about
paris
the
knowledge
its
inhabitants
have
of
it
is
very
various
but
in
all
cases
this
knowledge
is
far
greater
than
that
of
a
visitor
the
knowledge
again
is
far
greater
than
that
of
strangers
who
have
never
seen
paris
nobody
then
can
know
everything
even
about
paris
but
a
child
who
knows
what
a
large
town
is
and
can
fancy
to
himself
a
big
town
called
paris
which
is
the
biggest
and
most
important
town
in
france
has
some
knowledge
about
it
this
must
be
maintained
against
locke
against
the
schoolmaster
it
may
be
pointed
out
that
making
an
eskimo
say
the
words
is
the
capital
of
france
would
not
be
giving
him
any
knowledge
at
all
and
the
same
may
be
said
of
many
in
the
if
a
common
sailor
were
to
teach
an
eskimo
english
he
would
very
likely
suppose
that
when
he
had
taught
the
sounds
is
the
capital
of
france
he
had
conveyed
to
his
pupil
all
the
ideas
which
those
sounds
suggested
to
his
own
mind
a
common
schoolmaster
may
fall
into
a
similar
error
in
the
most
celebrated
work
which
has
been
affected
by
the
of
locke
we
find
childhood
treated
in
a
manner
altogether
different
from
youth
the
education
is
mainly
physical
and
instruction
is
not
given
till
the
age
of
twelve
system
on
first
sight
seems
very
different
to
this
but
there
is
a
deeper
connection
between
the
two
than
is
usually
observed
we
have
seen
that
locke
allowed
nothing
to
be
knowledge
that
was
not
acquired
by
the
perception
of
the
intellect
but
in
children
the
intellectual
power
is
not
yet
developed
so
according
to
locke
knowledge
properly
is
not
within
their
reach
what
then
can
the
educator
do
for
them
he
can
prepare
them
for
the
age
of
reason
in
two
ways
by
caring
first
for
their
physical
health
second
for
the
formation
of
good
habits
on
the
continent
locke
has
always
been
considered
one
of
the
first
advocates
of
physical
education
and
he
does
it
is
true
give
physical
education
the
first
place
a
feature
in
his
system
which
we
naturally
connect
with
his
study
of
medicine
and
also
with
the
trouble
he
had
all
his
life
with
his
own
health
but
care
of
the
body
and
especially
bodily
exercises
were
always
much
thought
of
in
this
country
and
the
main
writers
on
education
before
locke
sir
thos
elyot
mulcaster
milton
were
very
emphatic
about
physical
training
in
the
autobiography
of
lord
herbert
of
cherbury
we
may
see
what
attention
was
paid
in
own
century
to
this
part
of
education
and
that
only
is
educative
which
moulds
forms
or
modifies
the
soul
or
mark
pattison
in
quarterly
january
here
we
have
a
proposition
which
is
perhaps
seldom
denied
but
very
commonly
ignored
by
those
who
bring
up
the
young
but
locke
seems
to
have
been
entirely
possessed
with
this
notion
and
the
greater
part
of
the
is
nothing
but
a
long
application
of
it
the
principle
which
lies
at
the
root
of
most
of
his
advice
he
has
himself
expressed
as
follows
which
i
can
not
too
often
inculcate
is
that
whatever
the
matter
be
about
which
it
is
conversant
whether
great
or
small
the
main
i
had
almost
said
only
thing
to
be
considered
in
every
action
of
a
child
is
what
influence
it
will
have
upon
his
mind
what
habit
it
tends
to
and
is
likely
to
settle
in
him
how
it
will
become
him
when
he
is
bigger
and
if
it
be
encouraged
whither
it
will
lead
him
when
he
is
grown
p
here
we
see
that
locke
differed
widely
from
the
schoolmasters
of
his
time
perhaps
of
all
time
a
man
must
be
a
philosopher
indeed
if
he
can
spend
his
life
in
teaching
boys
and
yet
always
think
more
about
what
they
will
and
what
they
will
when
their
schooling
is
over
than
what
they
will
and
in
these
days
if
we
stopped
to
think
at
all
we
should
be
trodden
on
by
the
examiner
in
this
respect
locke
has
not
been
surpassed
like
his
predecessor
montaigne
he
took
for
his
centre
not
the
object
knowledge
but
the
subject
man
in
some
other
respects
he
does
not
seem
so
happy
he
makes
little
attempt
to
reach
a
scientific
standpoint
and
to
establish
general
truths
about
our
common
human
nature
he
thinks
not
so
much
of
the
man
as
the
gentleman
not
so
much
of
the
common
laws
of
the
mind
as
of
the
peculiarities
of
the
individual
child
he
even
hints
that
differences
of
disposition
in
children
render
treatises
on
education
defective
if
not
useless
are
a
thousand
other
things
that
may
need
he
writes
if
one
should
take
in
the
various
tempers
different
inclinations
and
particular
defaults
that
are
to
be
found
in
children
and
prescribe
proper
remedies
the
variety
is
so
great
that
it
would
require
a
volume
nor
would
that
reach
it
each
mind
has
some
peculiarity
as
well
as
his
face
that
distinguishes
him
from
all
others
and
there
are
possibly
scarce
two
children
who
can
be
conducted
by
exactly
the
same
method
besides
that
i
think
a
prince
a
nobleman
or
an
ordinary
son
should
have
different
ways
of
breeding
but
having
had
here
only
some
general
views
in
reference
to
the
main
end
and
aims
in
education
and
those
designed
for
a
son
whom
being
then
very
little
i
considered
only
as
white
paper
or
wax
to
be
moulded
and
fashioned
as
one
pleases
i
have
touched
little
more
than
those
heads
which
i
judged
necessary
for
the
breeding
of
a
young
gentleman
of
his
condition
in
p
no
language
could
bring
out
more
clearly
the
inferiority
of
standpoint
to
that
of
later
thinkers
he
makes
little
account
of
our
common
nature
and
wishes
education
to
be
based
upon
an
estimate
of
the
peculiarities
of
the
individual
pupil
and
of
his
social
needs
and
no
one
with
an
adequate
notion
of
education
could
ever
compare
the
young
child
to
paper
or
perhaps
the
development
of
an
organism
was
a
conception
that
could
not
have
been
formed
without
a
great
advance
in
physical
science
froebel
who
makes
most
of
it
learnt
it
from
the
scientific
study
of
trees
and
from
mineralogy
we
need
not
then
be
surprised
that
locke
does
not
say
as
pestalozzi
said
a
hundred
years
later
instead
of
merely
considering
what
is
to
be
imparted
to
children
ought
to
consider
first
what
they
already
but
if
he
had
read
comenius
he
would
have
been
saved
from
comparing
the
child
to
wax
or
white
paper
in
the
hands
of
the
educator
comenius
had
said
has
implanted
within
us
the
seeds
of
learning
of
virtue
and
of
piety
the
object
of
education
is
to
bring
these
seeds
to
p
this
seems
to
me
a
higher
conception
than
any
that
i
meet
with
in
locke
but
if
our
philosopher
did
not
learn
from
comenius
he
certainly
learnt
from
montaigne
indeed
arnstädt
has
put
him
into
a
series
of
thinkers
who
have
much
in
common
this
succession
is
as
follows
rabelais
montaigne
locke
rousseau
and
according
to
division
they
form
a
school
by
themselves
on
education
says
browning
those
who
wish
to
educate
through
the
study
of
the
classics
or
those
who
wish
to
educate
through
the
study
of
the
works
of
nature
or
those
who
aim
at
an
education
independent
of
study
and
knowledge
and
think
rather
of
the
training
of
character
and
the
attaining
to
the
greek
ideal
the
man
beautiful
and
to
the
three
schools
browning
gives
the
names
humanist
realist
and
naturalist
autres
naturalistes
montaigne
says
locke
he
considers
one
of
the
principal
writers
of
the
school
and
says
locke
given
a
powerful
bias
to
naturalistic
education
both
in
england
and
on
the
continent
for
the
last
p
this
use
of
the
word
seems
to
me
somewhat
misleading
or
at
best
vague
and
it
is
a
word
overworked
already
so
i
should
prefer
to
speak
of
the
or
school
the
classification
itself
certainly
has
its
uses
but
it
must
be
employed
with
caution
if
caught
up
by
those
who
have
only
an
elementary
acquaintance
with
the
subject
a
class
of
persons
apt
to
delight
in
such
arrangements
as
an
aid
to
memory
these
divisions
may
easily
prove
a
hindrance
to
light
this
subject
of
classification
is
so
important
to
students
that
it
may
be
worth
while
to
make
a
few
remarks
upon
it
the
only
thoroughly
consistent
people
are
the
people
of
fiction
we
can
know
all
about
directly
we
understand
their
central
thought
or
peculiarity
we
may
be
sure
that
everything
they
say
and
do
will
be
strictly
in
accordance
with
it
will
indeed
be
explainable
by
it
to
take
a
bald
and
simple
instance
directly
we
know
that
jellaby
in
is
absorbed
by
her
interest
in
an
african
mission
we
know
all
that
is
to
be
known
about
her
and
everything
she
does
or
omits
to
do
has
some
reference
to
borrioboola
ghar
but
in
real
life
not
only
are
people
much
less
easily
understood
but
when
we
actually
have
seized
their
main
idea
or
peculiarity
or
interest
we
must
not
expect
to
find
them
always
consistent
and
they
will
say
and
do
much
which
if
not
inconsistent
with
the
main
idea
or
peculiarity
or
interest
has
at
least
no
connection
with
it
suppose
you
can
make
out
with
some
certainty
that
locke
belonged
to
the
developing
school
you
must
not
expect
him
to
pay
little
heed
to
instruction
as
such
again
suppose
you
find
that
his
philosophy
was
utilitarian
you
must
not
suppose
that
in
everything
he
says
he
will
be
thinking
of
utility
now
the
historian
is
tempted
to
treat
real
men
and
women
as
the
writer
of
fiction
treats
his
puppets
having
fastened
quite
correctly
let
us
suppose
on
their
main
peculiarity
he
considers
it
necessary
to
square
everything
with
his
theory
of
them
and
whatever
will
not
fall
in
with
it
he
if
he
is
unscrupulous
misrepresents
or
if
he
is
scrupulous
suppresses
again
we
are
too
apt
to
read
into
words
meanings
derived
from
controversies
unknown
at
the
time
when
the
words
were
uttered
this
is
a
fact
in
the
history
of
religious
thought
we
must
always
consider
not
merely
the
words
used
but
the
time
when
they
were
used
what
a
man
might
say
quite
naturally
and
orthodoxly
at
one
period
would
be
sufficient
to
convict
him
of
sympathizing
with
some
terrible
heresy
if
uttered
half
a
century
later
we
find
something
like
this
in
the
history
of
education
if
anyone
nowadays
speaks
of
the
pleasure
with
which
as
a
young
man
he
read
tacitus
he
is
understood
to
mean
that
he
is
opposed
to
the
introduction
of
into
the
if
on
the
other
hand
he
extols
botany
or
regrets
that
he
never
learned
chemistry
this
is
taken
for
an
assault
on
classical
instruction
but
of
course
no
such
inference
could
be
drawn
if
we
went
back
to
a
time
when
the
antithesis
between
classics
and
natural
science
had
not
been
accentuated
in
many
other
instances
we
have
to
be
on
our
guard
against
forcing
into
language
meaning
which
belongs
rather
to
a
later
date
with
these
cautions
in
mind
let
us
see
how
far
locke
may
be
said
to
be
a
trainer
and
how
far
a
utilitarian
browning
attributes
to
rabelais
montaigne
and
locke
the
desire
to
bring
up
a
man
rather
than
a
good
scholar
but
rabelais
certainly
craved
for
the
knowledge
of
and
if
he
is
to
be
classed
at
all
i
should
put
him
rather
with
the
realists
albeit
he
lived
before
the
realistic
spirit
became
powerful
montaigne
went
more
on
the
lines
of
developing
rather
than
teaching
and
shrewd
man
of
the
world
as
he
was
he
thought
a
great
deal
about
the
art
of
living
but
his
ideal
was
not
so
much
the
man
as
the
gentleman
this
was
true
also
of
locke
and
here
we
see
some
explanation
why
both
montaigne
and
locke
do
not
value
classical
learning
on
the
continent
classical
learning
has
never
been
associated
with
the
character
of
an
accomplished
gentleman
and
as
far
as
i
know
the
conception
that
the
highest
type
of
excellence
is
found
in
the
union
of
scholar
and
the
is
peculiar
to
this
country
in
the
society
of
day
this
union
does
not
seem
to
have
been
recognized
and
locke
observes
great
part
of
the
learning
now
in
fashion
in
the
schools
of
europe
and
that
goes
ordinarily
into
the
round
of
education
a
gentleman
may
in
a
good
measure
be
unfurnished
with
without
any
great
disparagement
to
himself
or
prejudice
to
his
p
so
locke
sought
as
the
true
essential
for
the
young
gentleman
and
good
he
puts
his
requisites
in
the
following
order
of
importance
virtue
wisdom
manners
learning
and
so
learning
last
and
here
he
shews
himself
far
ahead
of
those
who
still
held
to
the
learned
ideal
but
his
notions
of
development
were
cramped
by
his
thinking
only
of
the
gentleman
and
what
was
requisite
for
him
ii
was
locke
a
utilitarian
in
education
it
is
the
fashion
and
in
history
as
in
other
things
fashion
is
a
powerful
force
it
is
the
fashion
to
treat
of
locke
as
a
great
champion
of
utilitarianism
we
might
expect
this
in
the
ordinary
historians
for
they
do
agree
their
unanimity
not
perhaps
very
wonderful
but
there
is
one
great
english
authority
quite
uninfluenced
by
them
who
has
said
the
same
thing
newman
the
cardinal
as
the
champion
of
authority
is
perhaps
prejudiced
against
locke
who
holds
that
faculty
of
reasoning
seldom
or
never
deceived
those
who
trusted
to
be
this
as
it
may
newman
asserts
that
tone
of
remarks
is
condemnatory
of
any
teaching
which
tends
to
the
general
cultivation
of
the
of
a
discourse
see
also
a
very
interesting
point
for
us
to
consider
is
then
is
this
reputation
of
for
utilitarianism
well
deserved
first
let
us
be
quite
certain
of
our
definition
in
learning
anything
there
are
two
points
to
be
considered
the
advantage
we
shall
find
from
knowing
that
subject
or
having
that
skill
and
the
effect
which
the
study
of
that
subject
or
practising
for
that
skill
will
have
on
the
mind
or
the
body
these
two
points
are
in
themselves
distinct
though
it
is
open
to
anyone
to
maintain
that
they
need
not
be
considered
separately
nature
has
provided
that
the
bodies
of
most
animals
should
get
the
exercise
best
for
them
in
procuring
food
so
herbert
spencer
has
come
to
the
conclusion
that
it
would
be
contrary
to
economy
of
if
one
set
of
occupations
were
needed
as
gymnastics
and
another
for
utility
in
other
words
he
considers
that
it
is
in
learning
the
most
useful
things
we
get
the
best
training
the
utilitarian
view
of
instruction
is
that
we
should
teach
things
useful
in
themselves
and
either
neglect
the
result
on
the
mind
and
body
of
the
learner
or
assume
law
of
economy
of
again
when
the
subjects
are
settled
the
utilitarian
thinks
how
the
knowledge
or
skill
may
be
most
speedily
acquired
and
not
how
this
method
or
that
method
of
acquisition
will
affect
the
faculties
this
being
utilitarianism
in
education
the
question
is
how
far
was
locke
the
utilitarian
he
is
generally
considered
if
we
take
by
itself
what
he
says
under
the
head
of
in
the
concerning
no
doubt
we
should
pronounce
him
a
utilitarian
he
considers
each
subject
of
instruction
and
pronounces
for
or
against
it
according
as
it
seems
likely
or
unlikely
to
be
useful
to
a
gentleman
and
in
the
methods
he
suggests
he
simply
points
out
the
quickest
route
as
if
the
knowledge
were
the
only
thing
to
be
thought
of
hence
his
utilitarian
reputation
but
two
very
important
considerations
have
been
lost
sight
of
learning
is
with
him
last
and
least
in
education
intellectual
education
was
not
for
childhood
but
for
the
age
when
we
can
teach
ourselves
a
man
has
got
an
entrance
into
any
of
the
sciences
says
he
will
be
time
then
to
depend
on
himself
and
rely
upon
his
own
understanding
and
exercise
his
own
faculties
which
is
the
only
way
to
improvement
and
to
peterborough
quoted
in
camb
edition
of
p
he
says
business
of
education
is
not
as
i
think
to
make
the
young
perfect
in
any
one
of
the
sciences
but
so
to
open
and
dispose
their
minds
as
may
best
make
them
capable
of
any
when
they
shall
apply
themselves
to
the
studies
he
proposes
in
the
of
the
which
is
his
treatise
on
intellectual
education
have
for
their
object
increase
of
the
powers
and
activity
of
the
mind
not
an
enlargement
of
its
of
thus
strange
to
say
the
supposed
leader
of
the
utilitarians
has
actually
propounded
in
so
many
words
the
doctrine
of
their
opponents
when
locke
is
more
studied
it
will
be
found
that
the
are
misleading
if
we
neglect
his
other
works
more
particularly
the
of
the
towards
the
end
of
his
days
locke
was
conscious
of
gleams
of
the
which
lay
before
the
generations
to
come
with
great
pathos
he
writes
to
a
friend
i
consider
how
much
of
my
life
has
been
trifled
away
in
beaten
tracks
where
i
vamped
on
with
others
only
to
follow
those
who
went
before
me
i
can
not
but
think
i
have
just
as
much
reason
to
be
proud
as
if
i
had
travelled
all
england
and
if
you
will
all
france
too
only
to
acquaint
myself
with
the
roads
and
be
able
to
tell
how
the
highways
lie
wherein
those
of
equipage
and
even
the
common
herd
too
travel
now
these
are
often
old
see
openings
to
truth
and
direct
paths
leading
to
it
wherein
a
little
application
and
industry
would
settle
mind
with
satisfaction
and
leave
no
darkness
or
doubt
but
this
is
the
end
of
my
day
when
my
sun
is
setting
and
though
the
prospect
it
has
given
me
be
what
i
would
not
for
anything
be
is
so
much
truth
beauty
and
consistency
in
it
is
for
one
of
your
age
i
think
i
ought
to
say
for
yourself
to
set
to
bolde
quoted
by
fowler
but
another
years
have
not
sufficed
to
put
us
in
possession
of
the
promised
land
of
which
locke
had
these
pisgah
visions
we
still
on
following
those
who
went
before
us
and
getting
small
help
from
expounders
of
as
a
but
as
it
would
seem
the
days
of
vamping
on
blindly
in
the
beaten
track
are
drawing
to
a
close
we
can
not
doubt
that
if
locke
had
known
the
wonderful
advance
which
various
sciences
have
made
since
his
day
he
would
have
seen
in
them
to
truth
and
direct
paths
leading
to
for
many
purposes
certainly
for
education
it
is
for
our
age
and
ages
to
come
to
set
about
applying
our
scientific
knowledge
to
the
bringing
up
of
children
and
thinkers
such
as
froebel
will
shew
us
how
concerning
and
his
of

be
in
the
hands
of
all
students
of
education
who
know
the
english
language
i
have
therefore
not
attempted
to
epitomise
what
he
has
said
but
have
endeavoured
to
get
at
the
main
thoughts
which
are
so
to
speak
the
taproot
of
his
system
of
the
there
is
an
edition
published
by
the
national
society
and
another
by
the
pitt

from

essay
of

an
edition

by
the
clarendon
press

above
stands
for
of
in
the
above
essay
i
have
not
treated
of
locke
as
a
methodizer
but
he
advocated
teaching
foreign
languages
and
he
published
fables
in
english
and
latin
interlineary
for
the
benefit
of
those
who
not
having
a
master
would
learn
either
of
these
when
i
edited
the

pitt
press
i
did
not
know
of
this
book
or
i
should
have
mentioned
it
xiv
rousseau
the
great
men
whom
we
meet
with
in
the
history
of
education
may
be
divided
into
two
classes
thinkers
and
doers
there
would
seem
no
good
reason
why
the
thinker
should
not
be
great
as
a
doer
or
the
doer
as
a
thinker
and
yet
we
hardly
find
any
records
of
men
who
have
been
successful
both
in
investigating
theory
and
directing
practice
history
tells
us
of
practical
schoolmasters
like
sturm
and
the
jesuits
but
they
did
not
think
out
their
own
theory
of
their
task
they
accepted
the
current
theory
of
their
time
on
the
other
hand
men
who
like
montaigne
and
locke
rejected
the
current
theory
and
sought
to
establish
a
better
by
an
appeal
to
reason
were
not
practical
schoolmasters
whenever
the
thinker
tries
to
turn
his
thought
into
action
he
has
cause
to
be
disappointed
with
the
result
we
saw
this
in
the
disastrous
failure
of
ratke
and
even
the
books
in
which
comenius
tried
to
work
out
his
principles
the
and
the
rest
with
the
exception
of
the
were
speedily
forgotten
in
the
world
of
education
as
elsewhere
it
takes
time
to
find
for
great
thoughts
the
practice
which
gives
effect
to
them
the
course
of
great
thoughts
is
in
some
ways
like
the
course
of
great
rivers
most
romantic
and
beautiful
near
their
source
they
are
not
most
useful
they
must
leave
the
mountains
in
which
they
first
appeared
and
must
flow
not
in
cataracts
but
smoothly
along
the
plain
among
the
dwellings
of
common
men
before
they
can
be
turned
to
account
in
the
business
of
life
the
eighteenth
century
was
soon
distinguished
by
boundless
activity
of
thought
and
this
thought
was
directed
mainly
to
a
great
work
of
destruction
europe
had
outgrown
the
ideas
of
the
middle
age
and
the
framework
of
society
which
the
middle
age
had
bequeathed
had
waxed
old
and
was
ready
to
vanish
as
soon
as
any
strong
force
could
be
found
to
push
it
out
of
the
way
as
matthew
arnold
has
described
frame
yet
stood
without
a
breach
blood
and
warmth
were
fled
still
it
spake
wonted
every
word
was
here
then
there
was
need
of
some
destructive
power
that
should
remove
and
burn
up
much
that
had
become
mere
obstacle
and
incumbrance
this
power
was
found
in
the
writings
which
appeared
in
france
about
the
middle
of
the
century
and
among
the
authors
of
them
none
spoke
with
more
effect
than
one
who
differed
from
all
the
rest
a
vagabond
without
family
ties
or
social
position
of
any
kind
with
no
literary
training
with
little
knowledge
and
in
conduct
at
least
with
no
morals
the
writings
of
rousseau
and
the
results
produced
by
them
are
among
the
strangest
things
in
history
and
especially
in
matters
of
education
it
is
more
than
doubtful
if
the
wise
man
of
the
world
montaigne
the
christian
philanthropist
comenius
or
that
of
truth
and
the
philosopher
locke
had
half
as
much
influence
as
this
depraved
serving
man
the
work
by
which
rousseau
became
famous
was
a
prize
essay
in
which
he
maintained
that
civilization
the
arts
and
all
human
institutions
were
from
first
to
last
pernicious
in
their
effects
and
that
no
happiness
was
possible
for
the
human
race
without
giving
them
all
up
and
returning
to
what
he
called
the
state
of
nature
he
glorified
the
if
man
had
brought
himself
to
a
state
of
misery
bordering
on
despair
by
following
his
own
many
inventions
take
away
all
these
inventions
and
you
will
have
man
in
his
proper
condition
the
argument
seems
something
of
this
kind
man
was
once
happy
man
is
now
miserable
undo
everything
that
has
been
done
and
man
will
be
happy
again
this
principle
of
a
state
existing
before
many
inventions
rousseau
applied
boldly
to
education
and
he
deduced
this
general
rule
precisely
the
opposite
to
what
is
usually
done
and
you
will
have
hit
on
the
right
not
reform
but
revolution
was
his
advice
he
took
the
ordinary
school
teaching
and
held
it
up
to
ridicule
and
certainly
he
did
prove
its
absurdity
and
a
most
valuable
service
he
thus
rendered
to
teachers
every
employment
while
it
makes
us
see
some
things
clearly
also
provides
us
with
blinkers
so
to
speak
which
prevent
our
seeing
other
things
at
all
the
school
blinkers
often
prevent
his
seeing
much
that
is
plain
enough
to
other
people
and
when
a
writer
like
rousseau
takes
off
our
blinkers
for
us
and
makes
us
look
about
us
he
does
us
a
great
deal
of
good
but
we
need
more
than
this
if
we
have
children
entrusted
to
us
we
must
do
something
with
them
and
rule
of
doing
the
opposite
to
what
is
usual
will
not
be
found
universally
applicable
so
we
consult
rousseau
again
and
what
is
his
advice
rousseau
would
bring
everything
back
to
the
state
and
unfortunately
he
never
pauses
to
settle
whether
he
means
by
this
a
state
of
ideal
perfection
or
of
simply
savagery
the
savage
he
says
gets
his
education
without
any
troubling
about
it
and
so
he
infers
that
all
the
trouble
taken
by
the
civilized
is
worse
than
thrown
away
but
he
does
not
fall
back
on
he
urges
on
parents
the
duty
of
attending
to
the
bringing
up
of
their
children
de
mère
point
mother
no
child
says
he
and
he
would
have
the
father
see
to
the
training
of
the
child
whom
the
mother
has
suckled
picture
of
family
life
is
given
us
where
few
englishmen
are
likely
to
find
it
enveloped
in
the
here
we
read
how
julie
always
has
her
children
with
her
and
while
seeming
to
let
them
do
as
they
like
conceals
with
the
air
of
apparent
carelessness
the
most
vigilant
observation
possessed
by
the
notion
that
there
can
be
no
intellectual
education
before
the
age
of
reason
she
proclaims
fonction
dont
je
suis
chargée
pas
mes
fils
mais
de
les
préparer
pour
être
élevés
my
business
is
not
to
educate
my
sons
but
to
prepare
them
for
being
lett
there
is
much
that
is
very
pleasing
in
this
picture
of
ideal
family
life
but
when
rousseau
comes
formally
to
propound
his
ideas
on
education
he
gives
up
family
life
to
attain
greater
simplicity
tiens
à
ce
qui
est
plus
simple
says
he
i
stick
to
is
the
more
he
tries
to
state
everything
in
its
lowest
terms
so
to
speak
and
this
method
is
excellent
so
long
as
he
puts
on
one
side
only
what
is
accidental
and
retains
all
the
essentials
of
the
problem
but
his
rage
for
simplicity
sometimes
carried
him
beyond
this
there
is
an
old
cambridge
story
of
a
problem
introducing
an
elephant
weight
may
be
this
is
after
the
manner
of
rousseau
in
the
bringing
up
of
the
model
child
he
parents
brothers
and
sisters
young
companions
and
though
he
says
that
the
needful
qualities
of
a
master
may
be
expected
only
in
homme
de
génie
he
hands
over
émile
to
a
governor
to
live
an
isolated
life
in
the
country
this
governor
is
to
devote
himself
for
some
years
entirely
to
imparting
to
his
pupil
these
difficult
art
of
being
ignorant
and
of
losing
time
till
he
is
twelve
years
old
émile
is
to
have
no
direct
instruction
whatever
that
age
he
shall
not
know
what
a
book
is
says
rousseau
though
elsewhere
we
are
told
that
he
will
learn
to
read
of
his
own
accord
by
the
time
he
is
ten
if
no
attempt
is
made
to
teach
him
he
is
to
be
under
no
restraint
and
is
to
do
nothing
but
what
he
sees
to
be
useful
freedom
from
restraint
is
however
to
be
apparent
not
real
as
in
ordinary
education
the
child
employs
all
its
faculties
in
duping
the
master
so
in
education
to
the
master
is
to
devote
himself
to
duping
the
child
him
always
be
his
own
master
in
appearance
and
do
you
take
care
to
be
so
in
reality
there
is
no
subjection
so
complete
as
that
which
preserves
the
appearance
of
liberty
it
is
by
this
means
even
the
will
is
led
most
critical
interval
of
human
nature
is
that
between
the
hour
of
our
birth
and
twelve
years
of
age
this
is
the
time
wherein
vice
and
error
take
root
without
our
being
possessed
of
any
instrument
to
destroy
throughout
this
season
the
governor
is
to
be
at
work
training
the
pupil
in
the
art
of
being
ignorant
and
losing
time
first
education
should
be
purely
negative
it
consists
by
no
means
in
teaching
virtue
or
truth
but
in
securing
the
heart
from
vice
and
the
intellect
from
error
if
you
could
do
nothing
and
let
nothing
be
done
if
you
could
bring
on
your
pupil
healthy
and
strong
to
the
age
of
without
his
being
able
to
tell
his
right
hand
from
his
left
from
your
very
first
lessons
the
eyes
of
his
understanding
would
open
to
reason
being
without
prejudices
and
without
habits
he
would
have
nothing
in
him
to
thwart
the
effect
of
your
care
and
by
beginning
with
doing
nothing
you
would
have
made
an
educational
his
body
his
organs
his
senses
his
powers
but
keep
his
mind
passive
as
long
as
possible
mistrust
all
his
sentiments
formed
before
the
judgment
which
determines
their
value
restrain
avoid
all
foreign
impressions
and
to
prevent
the
birth
of
evil
be
in
no
hurry
to
cause
good
for
good
is
good
only
in
the
light
of
reason
look
on
all
delays
as
so
many
advantages
it
is
a
great
gain
to
advance
towards
the
goal
without
loss
let
childhood
ripen
in
children
in
short
whatever
lesson
they
may
need
be
sure
not
to
give
it
them
if
you
can
safely
put
it
off
till
not
then
alarm
yourself
much
about
this
apparent
idleness
what
would
you
say
of
the
man
who
in
order
to
make
the
most
of
life
should
determine
never
to
go
to
sleep
you
would
say
the
man
is
mad
he
is
not
enjoying
the
time
he
is
depriving
himself
of
it
to
avoid
sleep
he
is
hurrying
towards
death
consider
then
that
it
is
the
same
here
and
that
childhood
is
the
sleep
of
we
have
now
reached
the
climax
or
shall
we
say
the
nadir
in
negation
rousseau
has
given
the
de
to
the
ideal
of
the
renascence
comenius
was
the
first
to
take
a
comprehensive
view
of
the
task
and
to
connect
it
with
nature
and
destiny
but
he
could
not
get
clear
from
an
of
the
importance
of
knowledge
according
to
his
ideal
man
should
know
all
things
so
in
practice
he
thought
too
much
of
imparting
knowledge
then
came
locke
and
treated
the
imparting
of
knowledge
as
of
trifling
importance
when
compared
with
the
formation
of
character
but
he
too
in
practice
hardly
went
so
far
as
this
principle
might
have
led
him
he
was
much
under
the
influence
of
social
distinctions
and
could
not
help
thinking
of
what
it
was
necessary
for
a
gentleman
to
know
so
that
rousseau
was
the
very
first
to
shake
himself
entirely
free
from
the
notion
which
the
renascence
had
handed
down
that
man
was
mainly
a
animal
rousseau
has
the
courage
to
deny
this
in
the
most
emphatic
manner
possible
and
to
say
the
first
years
the
educator
must
teach
the
child
in
this
reaction
against
the
renascence
rousseau
puts
the
truth
in
the
form
of
such
a
violent
paradox
that
we
start
back
in
terror
but
it
was
perhaps
necessary
thus
to
sweep
away
the
ordinary
schoolroom
rubbish
before
the
true
nature
of
the
task
could
be
fairly
considered
the
rubbish
having
been
cleared
away
what
was
to
take
its
place
no
longer
having
his
mind
engrossed
by
the
knowledge
he
wished
to
communicate
the
educator
had
now
an
eye
for
something
else
not
less
worthy
of
his
attention
the
child
itself
rousseau
was
the
first
to
base
education
entirely
on
a
study
of
the
child
to
be
educated
and
by
doing
this
he
became
as
i
believe
one
of
the
greatest
of
educational
reformers
it
was
however
purely
as
a
thinker
or
rather
as
a
giving
expression
to
the
general
discontent
that
rousseau
became
such
a
tremendous
force
in
europe
he
has
indeed
often
been
called
the
father
of
the
first
french
revolution
which
he
did
not
live
to
see
but
as
macaulay
has
well
said
a
good
deal
besides
eloquent
writing
is
needed
to
cause
such
a
convulsion
and
we
can
no
more
attribute
the
french
revolution
to
the
writings
of
rousseau
than
we
can
attribute
the
shock
of
an
explosion
of
gunpowder
to
the
lucifer
match
without
which
it
might
never
have
happened
rousseau
did
in
the
world
of
ideas
what
the
french
revolutionists
afterwards
did
in
the
world
of
politics
he
made
a
clean
sweep
and
endeavoured
to
start
afresh
i
have
already
said
that
as
regards
education
i
think
his
labours
in
destruction
were
of
very
great
value
but
what
shall
we
say
of
his
efforts
at
construction
there
would
not
be
the
least
difficulty
in
showing
that
most
of
his
proposals
are
impracticable
it
is
no
more
to
treat
as
a
typical
case
a
child
brought
up
in
solitude
than
it
would
be
to
write
a
treatise
on
the
rearing
of
a
bee
cut
off
from
the
hive
rousseau
requires
impossibilities
he
postulates
that
the
child
is
never
to
be
brought
into
contact
with
anyone
who
might
set
a
bad
example
modern
science
has
shown
us
that
the
young
are
liable
to
take
diseases
from
impurities
in
the
air
they
breathe
but
as
yet
no
one
has
proposed
that
all
children
should
be
kept
at
an
elevation
of
feet
above
the
level
of
the
sea
yet
the
advice
would
be
about
as
practicable
as
the
advice
of
rousseau
a
method
which
always
starts
with
paradox
and
not
infrequently
ends
with
platitude
might
seem
to
have
little
in
its
favour
and
rousseau
has
had
far
less
influence
since
in
the
words
of
herman
merivale
was
dethroned
with
the
fall
of
his
extravagant
child
the
first
no
doubt
the
great
exponent
of
english
opinion
was
right
in
calling
rousseau
most
stranger
who
ever
landed
on
our
and
the
torch
of
his
eloquence
will
never
cause
a
conflagration
still
less
an
explosion
here
his
disregard
for
rather
his
evident
purpose
of
making
an
impression
by
defying
and
saying
just
the
opposite
of
what
is
expected
is
simply
distressing
to
us
but
there
is
no
denying
genius
his
was
one
of
the
original
voices
that
go
on
sounding
and
awakening
echoes
in
all
lands
willingly
or
unwillingly
at
first
hand
or
from
imperfect
echoes
everyone
who
studies
education
must
study
rousseau
as
specimens
of
teaching
i
will
give
a
few
characteristic
passages
from
the
émile
is
good
as
it
leaves
the
hands
of
the
creator
everything
degenerates
in
the
hands
of
these
are
the
first
words
of
the
and
the
of
philosophy
are
born
weak
we
have
need
of
strength
we
are
born
destitute
of
everything
we
have
need
of
assistance
we
are
born
stupid
we
have
need
of
understanding
all
that
we
have
not
at
our
birth
and
which
we
require
when
grown
up
is
bestowed
on
us
by
education
this
education
we
receive
from
nature
from
men
or
from
things
the
internal
development
of
our
organs
and
faculties
is
the
education
of
nature
the
use
we
are
taught
to
make
of
that
development
is
the
education
given
us
by
men
and
in
the
acquisitions
made
by
our
own
experience
on
the
objects
that
surround
us
consists
our
education
from
the
concurrence
of
these
three
kinds
of
education
is
necessary
to
their
perfection
it
is
by
that
one
which
is
entirely
independent
of
us
we
must
regulate
the
two
now
live
is
not
merely
to
breathe
it
is
to
act
it
is
to
make
use
of
our
organs
our
senses
our
faculties
and
of
all
those
parts
of
ourselves
which
give
us
the
feeling
of
our
existence
the
man
who
has
lived
most
is
not
he
who
has
counted
the
greatest
number
of
years
but
he
who
has
most
thoroughly
felt
the
aim
of
education
then
must
be
complete
living
but
ordinary
education
instead
of
seeking
to
develop
the
life
of
the
child
sacrifices
childhood
to
the
acquirement
of
knowledge
or
rather
the
semblance
of
knowledge
which
it
is
thought
will
prove
useful
to
the
youth
or
the
man
great
merit
lies
in
his
having
exposed
this
fundamental
error
he
says
very
truly
do
not
understand
childhood
and
pursuing
false
ideas
of
it
our
every
step
takes
us
further
astray
the
wisest
among
us
fix
upon
what
it
concerns
men
to
know
without
ever
considering
what
children
are
capable
of
learning
they
always
expect
to
find
the
man
in
the
child
without
thinking
of
what
the
child
is
before
it
is
a
man
and
this
is
the
study
to
which
i
have
especially
devoted
myself
in
order
that
should
my
entire
method
be
false
and
visionary
my
observations
might
always
turn
to
account
i
may
not
have
seen
aright
what
ought
to
be
done
but
i
believe
i
have
seen
aright
the
subject
on
which
we
have
to
act
begin
then
by
studying
your
pupils
better
for
most
certainly
you
do
not
understand
wills
that
children
should
be
before
they
are
if
we
seek
to
pervert
this
order
we
shall
produce
forward
fruits
without
ripeness
or
flavour
and
not
ripe
soon
rotten
we
shall
have
young
and
old
children
childhood
has
ways
of
seeing
thinking
feeling
peculiar
to
itself
nothing
is
more
absurd
than
to
wish
to
substitute
ours
in
their
never
know
how
to
put
ourselves
in
the
place
of
children
we
do
not
enter
into
their
ideas
we
attribute
to
them
our
own
and
following
always
our
own
train
of
thought
even
with
syllogisms
we
manage
to
fill
their
heads
with
nothing
but
extravagance
and
wish
some
discreet
person
would
give
us
a
treatise
on
the
art
of
observing
art
which
would
be
of
immense
value
to
us
but
of
which
fathers
and
schoolmasters
have
not
as
yet
learnt
the
very
first
in
these
passages
rousseau
strikes
the
of
true
education
the
first
thing
necessary
for
us
is
to
see
aright
the
subject
on
which
we
have
to
act
unfortunately
however
this
subject
has
often
been
the
subject
most
neglected
in
the
schoolroom
children
have
been
treated
as
if
they
were
made
for
their
school
books
not
their
school
books
for
them
as
education
has
been
thought
of
as
learning
childhood
has
been
treated
as
unimportant
a
necessary
stage
in
existence
no
doubt
but
far
more
troublesome
and
hardly
more
interesting
than
the
state
of
the
chrysalis
if
some
forms
of
words
tables
declensions
county
towns
and
the
like
can
be
drummed
into
children
this
is
say
educators
of
the
old
school
a
clear
gain
for
the
rest
nothing
can
be
done
with
them
except
teaching
them
to
read
write
and
say
the
multiplication
table
but
since
the
publication
of
the
émile
there
has
been
in
the
world
a
very
different
view
of
education
according
to
this
view
the
importance
of
childhood
is
not
to
be
measured
by
the
amount
of
knowledge
or
even
the
number
of
words
we
can
force
it
to
remember
according
to
this
view
in
dealing
with
children
we
must
not
think
of
our
knowledge
or
of
our
notions
at
all
we
must
think
not
of
our
own
minds
but
of
the
minds
of
the
little
ones
the
absurd
results
in
which
the
opposite
course
has
ended
rousseau
exposes
with
great
severity
the
studies
demanded
from
the
poor
unfortunates
lead
to
such
things
as
are
entirely
beyond
the
range
of
their
ideas
so
you
may
judge
what
amount
of
attention
they
can
give
to
them
schoolmasters
who
make
a
great
display
of
the
instruction
they
give
their
pupils
are
paid
to
differ
from
me
but
we
see
from
what
they
do
that
they
are
entirely
of
my
opinion
for
what
do
they
really
teach
words
words
for
ever
words
among
the
various
knowledges
which
they
boast
of
giving
they
are
careful
not
to
include
such
as
would
be
of
use
because
these
would
involve
a
knowledge
of
things
and
there
they
would
be
sure
to
fail
but
they
choose
subjects
that
seem
to
be
known
when
the
terms
are
known
such
as
heraldry
geography
chronology
languages
and
the
like
all
of
them
studies
so
foreign
to
a
man
and
still
more
to
a
child
that
it
is
a
great
chance
if
anything
of
the
whole
lot
ever
proves
useful
to
him
on
a
single
occasion
in
his
whole
the
study
may
be
without
the
idea
of
the
things
represented
the
signs
representing
them
go
for
nothing
and
yet
the
child
is
always
kept
to
these
signs
without
our
being
able
to
make
him
comprehend
any
of
the
things
they
what
does
a
child
understand
by
an
old
geography
book
says
candidly
that
it
is
a
round
thing
made
of
plaster
and
this
is
the
only
notion
children
have
of
it
what
a
fearful
waste
and
worse
than
waste
it
is
to
make
them
learn
the
signs
without
the
things
when
if
they
ever
learn
the
things
they
must
at
the
same
time
acquire
the
signs
conf
ruskin
if
nature
gives
to
the
brain
this
pliability
which
makes
it
capable
of
receiving
impressions
of
every
kind
this
is
not
that
we
may
engrave
on
it
the
names
of
kings
dates
the
technical
words
of
heraldry
of
astronomy
of
geography
and
all
those
words
meaningless
at
his
age
and
useless
at
any
age
with
which
we
oppress
his
sad
and
sterile
childhood
but
that
all
the
ideas
which
he
can
conceive
and
which
are
useful
to
him
all
those
which
relate
to
his
happiness
and
will
one
day
make
his
duty
plain
to
him
may
trace
themselves
there
in
characters
never
to
be
effaced
and
may
assist
him
in
conducting
himself
through
life
in
a
manner
appropriate
to
his
nature
and
his
with
rousseau
as
afterwards
with
froebel
education
was
a
kind
of
are
developed
by
cultivation

he

education

par
the
governor
who
is
the
is
to
aim
at
three
things
first
he
is
to
shield
the
child
from
all
corrupting
influences
second
he
is
to
devote
himself
to
developing
in
the
child
a
healthy
and
strong
body
in
which
the
senses
are
to
be
rendered
acute
by
exercise
third
he
is
by
practice
not
precept
to
cultivate
the
sense
of
duty
in
his
study
of
children
rousseau
fixed
on
their
activity
failing
energy
concentrates
itself
in
the
heart
of
the
old
man
in
the
heart
of
the
child
energy
is
overflowing
and
spreads
outwards
he
feels
in
him
life
enough
to
animate
all
his
surroundings
whether
he
makes
or
mars
it
is
all
one
to
him
it
is
enough
that
he
has
changed
the
state
of
things
and
every
change
is
an
action
if
he
seems
by
preference
to
destroy
this
is
not
from
mischief
but
the
act
of
construction
is
always
slow
and
the
act
of
destruction
being
quicker
is
more
suited
to
his
one
of
the
first
requisites
in
the
care
of
the
young
is
then
to
provide
for
the
expansion
of
their
activity
all
restraints
such
as
swaddling
clothes
for
infants
and
and
for
children
are
to
be
entirely
done
away
with
literary
instruction
must
not
be
thought
of
must
be
no
other
book
than
the
world
says
rousseau
other
instruction
than
facts
the
child
who
reads
does
not
think
he
does
nothing
but
read
he
gets
no
instruction
he
learns

if
it
be
objected
that
according
to
plan
there
would
be
a
neglect
of
memory
he
replies
the
study
of
books
the
kind
of
memory
that
a
child
should
have
will
not
remain
inactive
all
he
sees
all
he
hears
strikes
him
and
he
remembers
it
he
keeps
a
record
in
himself
of
actions
and
talk
and
all
around
him
makes
the
book
by
which
without
thinking
of
it
he
is
constantly
enriching
his
memory
against
the
time
that
his
judgment
may
benefit
by
it

we
should
be
most
careful
not
to
commit
to
our
memory
anything
we
do
not
understand
for
if
we
do
we
can
never
tell
what
part
of
our
stores
really
belong
to
us
on
the
positive
side
the
most
striking
part
of
advice
relates
to
the
training
of
the
senses
first
faculties
which
become
strong
in
us
says
he
our
senses
these
then
are
the
first
that
should
be
cultivated
they
are
in
fact
the
only
faculties
we
forget
or
at
least
those
which
we
neglect
most
we
find
that
the
young
child
to
touch
and
handle
everything
by
no
means
check
this
restlessness
it
points
to
a
very
necessary
apprenticeship
thus
it
is
that
the
child
gets
to
be
conscious
of
the
hotness
or
coldness
the
hardness
or
softness
the
heaviness
or
lightness
of
bodies
to
judge
of
their
size
and
shape
and
all
their
sensible
properties
by
looking
feeling
listening
especially
by
comparing
sight
and
touch
and
combining
the
sensations
of
the
eye
with
those
of
the
a
cat
enter
a
room
for
the
first
time
she
examines
round
and
stares
and
sniffs
about
without
a
rest
she
is
satisfied
with
nothing
before
she
has
tried
it
and
made
it
out
this
is
just
what
a
child
does
when
he
begins
to
walk
and
enters
so
to
say
the
chamber
of
the
world
the
only
difference
is
that
to
the
sight
which
is
common
to
the
child
and
the
cat
the
first
joins
in
his
observations
the
hands
which
nature
has
given
him
and
the
other
animal
that
subtle
sense
of
smell
which
has
been
bestowed
upon
her
it
is
this
tendency
according
as
it
is
well
cultivated
or
the
reverse
that
makes
children
either
sharp
or
dull
active
or
slow
giddy
or
thoughtful
first
natural
movements
of
the
child
being
then
to
measure
himself
with
his
surroundings
and
to
test
in
everything
he
sees
all
its
sensible
properties
which
may
concern
him
his
first
study
is
a
kind
of
experimental
physics
relating
to
his
own
preservation
and
from
this
we
divert
him
to
speculative
studies
before
he
feels
himself
at
home
here
below
so
long
as
his
delicate
and
flexible
organs
can
adjust
themselves
to
the
bodies
on
which
they
ought
to
act
so
long
as
his
senses
as
yet
uncorrupted
are
free
from
illusion
this
is
the
time
to
exercise
them
all
in
their
proper
functions
this
is
the
time
to
learn
to
understand
the
sensuous
relations
which
things
have
with
us
as
everything
that
enters
the
mind
finds
its
way
through
the
senses
the
first
reason
of
a
human
being
is
a
reason
of
sensations
this
it
is
which
forms
the
basis
of
the
intellectual
reason
our
first
masters
in
philosophy
are
our
feet
our
hands
our
eyes
substituting
books
for
all
this
is
not
teaching
us
to
reason
but
simply
to
use
the
reason
of
other
people
it
teaches
us
to
take
a
great
deal
on
trust
and
never
to
know
anything
order
to
practise
an
art
we
must
begin
by
getting
the
proper
implements
and
that
we
may
have
good
use
of
these
implements
they
must
be
made
strong
enough
to
stand
wear
and
tear
that
we
may
learn
to
think
we
must
then
exercise
our
members
our
senses
our
organs
as
these
are
the
implements
of
our
intelligence
and
that
we
may
make
the
most
of
these
implements
the
body
which
supplies
them
must
be
strong
and
healthy
we
see
then
that
far
from
true
reason
forming
itself
independently
of
his
body
it
is
the
sound
constitution
of
the
body
that
makes
the
operations
of
the
mind
easy
and
rousseau
does
not
confine
himself
to
advising
that
the
senses
should
be
cultivated
he
also
gives
some
hints
of
the
in
which
they
should
be
cultivated
and
many
modern
experiments
such
as
and
the
use
of
actual
weights
and
measures
may
be
directly
traced
to
him
soon
as
a
child
begins
to
distinguish
objects
a
proper
choice
should
be
made
in
those
which
are
presented
to
elsewhere
he
says
exercise
the
senses
is
not
simply
to
make
use
of
them
it
is
to
learn
to
judge
aright
by
means
of
them
it
is
to
learn
so
to
say
to
perceive
for
we
can
only
touch
and
see
and
hear
according
as
we
have
learnt
how
there
is
a
kind
of
exercise
perfectly
natural
and
mechanical
which
serves
to
make
the
body
strong
without
giving
anything
for
the
judgment
to
lay
hold
of
swimming
running
jumping
stone
throwing
all
this
is
capital
but
have
we
nothing
but
arms
and
legs
have
we
not
also
eyes
and
ears
and
are
these
organs
not
needed
in
our
use
of
the
others
do
not
then
merely
exercise
the
strength
but
exercise
all
the
senses
which
direct
it
get
all
you
can
out
of
each
of
them
and
then
check
the
impressions
of
one
by
the
impressions
of
another
measure
reckon
weigh
two
subjects
there
were
in
which
émile
was
to
receive
instruction
viz
music
and
drawing
advice
about
drawing
is
well
worth
considering
he
says
who
are
great
imitators
all
try
to
draw
i
should
wish
my
child
to
cultivate
this
art
not
exactly
for
the
art
itself
but
to
make
his
eye
correct
and
his
hand
supple
les
enfants
grands
imitateurs
essayent
tous
de
dessiner
je
voudrais
que
le
mien
cultivât
cet
art
non
précisément
pour
même
mais
pour
se
rendre
juste
et
la
main
but
émile
is
to
be
kept
clear
of
the
ordinary
who
would
put
him
to
imitate
imitations
and
there
is
a
striking
contrast
between
suggestions
and
those
of
the
authorities
at
south
kensington
technical
skill
he
cares
for
less
than
the
training
of
the
eye
so
émile
is
always
to
draw
the
and
says
rousseau
intention
is
not
so
much
that
he
should
get
to
the
objects
as
get
to
them
mon
intention
pas
tant
sache
imiter
les
objets
que
les
before
we
pass
the
age
of
twelve
years
at
which
point
as
someone
says
rousseau
substitutes
another
émile
for
the
one
he
has
hitherto
spoken
of
let
us
look
at
his
proposals
for
moral
training
rousseau
is
right
beyond
question
in
desiring
that
children
should
be
treated
as
children
but
what
are
children
what
can
they
understand
what
is
the
world
in
which
they
live
is
it
the
material
world
only
or
is
the
moral
world
also
open
to
them
vol
on
the
subject
of
morals
rousseau
seems
to
have
admirable
instincts
but
no
principles
and
moral
as
he
is
instinct
there
is
always
some
confusion
in
what
he
says
at
one
time
he
asserts
that
is
only
one
knowledge
to
give
children
and
that
is
a
knowledge
of
duty
il
a
science
à
enseigner
aux
enfants
celle
des
devoirs
de
elsewhere
he
says
know
right
from
wrong
to
be
conscious
of
the
reason
of
duty
is
not
the
business
of
a
child
connaître
le
bien
et
le
mal
sentir
la
raison
des
devoirs
de
pas
in
another
place
he
mounts
his
hobby
that
most
sublime
virtues
are
and
that
about
the
best
man
who
ever
lived
till
he
found
friday
was
robinson
crusoe
the
outcome
of
all
teaching
on
this
subject
seems
that
we
should
in
every
way
develop
the
animal
or
physical
life
retard
his
intellectual
life
and
ignore
his
life
as
a
spiritual
and
moral
being
a
variety
of
influences
had
combined
as
they
combine
still
to
draw
attention
away
from
the
importance
of
physical
training
and
by
placing
the
bodily
organs
and
senses
as
the
first
things
to
be
thought
of
in
education
rousseau
did
much
to
save
us
from
the
bad
tradition
of
the
renascence
but
there
were
more
things
in
heaven
and
earth
than
were
dreamt
of
in
his
philosophy
and
whatever
rousseau
might
say
émile
could
never
be
restrained
from
inquiring
after
them
every
boy
will
he
will
think
however
unable
he
may
seem
to
think
in
the
direction
in
which
his
instructors
try
to
urge
him
the
wise
elders
who
have
charge
of
him
must
take
this
into
account
and
must
endeavour
to
guide
him
into
thinking
modestly
and
thinking
right
then
again
as
soon
as
the
child
can
speak
or
before
the
world
of
sensation
becomes
for
him
a
world
not
of
sensations
only
but
also
of
sentiments
of
sympathies
of
affections
of
consciousness
of
right
and
wrong
good
and
evil
all
these
feelings
it
is
true
may
be
affected
by
traditional
prejudices
the
air
the
child
breathes
may
also
contain
much
that
is
noxious
but
we
have
no
more
power
to
exclude
the
atmosphere
of
the
moral
world
than
of
the
physical
all
we
can
do
is
to
take
thought
for
fresh
air
in
both
cases
as
for
notion
that
we
can
withdraw
the
child
from
the
moral
atmosphere
we
see
in
it
nothing
but
a
proof
how
little
he
understood
the
problems
he
professed
to
solve
although
the
governor
is
to
devote
himself
to
a
single
child
rousseau
is
careful
to
protest
against
would
stupify
the
child
says
he
you
were
constantly
directing
him
if
you
were
always
saying
to
him
here
go
there
stop
do
this
do
that
if
your
head
always
directs
his
arms
his
own
head
becomes
useless
to
here
we
have
a
warning
which
should
not
be
neglected
by
those
who
maintain
the
in
france
and
the
ordinary
private
in
england
in
these
schools
a
boy
is
hardly
called
upon
to
exercise
his
will
all
day
long
he
rises
in
the
morning
when
he
must
at
meals
he
eats
till
he
is
obliged
to
stop
he
is
taken
out
for
exercise
like
a
horse
he
has
all
his
indoor
work
prescribed
for
him
both
as
to
time
and
quantity
in
this
kind
of
life
he
never
has
occasion
to
think
or
act
for
himself
he
is
therefore
without
so
much
care
is
taken
to
prevent
his
doing
wrong
that
he
gets
to
think
only
of
checks
from
without
he
is
therefore
incapable
of
in
the
english
public
schools
boys
have
much
less
supervision
from
their
elders
and
organise
a
great
portion
of
their
lives
for
themselves
this
proves
a
better
preparation
for
life
after
the
school
age
and
most
public
schoolmasters
would
agree
with
rousseau
that
lessons
the
boys
get
from
each
other
in
the
playground
are
a
hundred
times
more
useful
to
them
than
the
lessons
given
them
in
school
les
leçons
que
les
écoliers
prennent
entre
eux
dans
la
cour
du
collège
leur
sont
cent
fois
plus
utiles
que
tout
ce
leur
dira
jamais
dans
la
on
questions
put
by
children
rousseau
says
art
of
questioning
is
not
so
easy
as
it
may
be
thought
it
is
rather
the
art
of
the
master
than
of
the
pupil
we
must
have
learnt
a
good
deal
of
a
thing
to
be
able
to
ask
what
we
do
not
know
the
learned
know
and
inquire
says
an
indian
proverb
but
the
ignorant
know
not
what
to
inquire
and
from
this
he
infers
that
children
learn
less
from
asking
than
from
being
asked
questions
p
at
twelve
years
old
émile
is
said
to
be
fit
for
instruction
is
the
time
for
labour
for
instruction
for
study
and
observe
that
it
is
not
i
who
arbitrarily
make
this
choice
it
is
pointed
out
to
us
by
nature
what
novelties
await
us
here
as
we
have
seen
rousseau
was
determined
to
recommend
nothing
that
would
harmonise
with
ordinary
educational
practice
but
even
a
genius
though
he
may
abandon
previous
practice
can
not
keep
clear
of
previous
thought
and
plan
for
instruction
is
obviously
connected
with
the
thoughts
of
montaigne
and
of
locke
but
while
on
the
same
lines
with
these
great
writers
rousseau
goes
beyond
them
and
is
both
clearer
and
bolder
than
they
are
proposals
for
instruction
have
the
following
main
features
instruction
is
to
be
no
longer
literary
or
linguistic
the
teaching
about
words
is
to
disappear
and
the
young
are
not
to
learn
by
books
or
about
books
the
subjects
to
be
studied
are
to
be
mathematics
and
physical
science
the
method
to
be
adopted
is
not
the
didactic
but
the
method
of
the
hands
are
to
be
called
into
play
as
a
means
of
learning
till
quite
recently
the
only
learning
ever
given
in
schools
was
a
fact
to
which
the
language
of
the
people
still
bears
witness
when
a
child
does
not
profit
by
school
instruction
he
is
always
said
to
be
good
at
his
the
tendency
is
to
change
the
character
of
the
schools
so
that
they
may
become
less
and
less
mere
in
this
rousseau
seems
to
have
been
a
century
and
more
in
advance
of
us
and
yet
we
can
not
credit
him
with
any
remarkable
wisdom
or
insight
about
literature
he
himself
used
books
as
a
means
of
a
store
of
ideas
true
or
false
but
at
any
rate
chap
and
he
has
recorded
for
us
his
opinion
that
sensible
and
interesting
conversations
of
a
young
woman
of
merit
are
more
proper
to
form
a
young
man
than
all
the
pedantical
philosophy
of
quoted
by
morley
after
this
whatever
we
may
think
of
the
merit
of
his
suggestions
we
can
sit
at
the
feet
no
longer
rousseau
had
himself
little
knowledge
of
mathematics
and
natural
science
but
he
was
strongly
in
favour
of
the
of
and
in
his
last
years
his
devotion
to
botany
became
a
passion
his
curriculum
for
émile
is
in
the
air
but
the
chief
thing
is
to
get
him
to
attend
to
the
phenomena
of
nature
and
foster
his
curiosity
by
being
in
no
hurry
to
satisfy
about
teaching
and
learning
there
is
one
point
on
which
we
find
a
consensus
of
great
authorities
extending
from
the
least
learned
of
writers
who
was
probably
rousseau
to
the
most
learned
who
was
probably
friedrich
august
wolf
in
one
form
or
other
these
assert
that
there
is
no
true
teaching
but
past
a
doubt
the
besetting
weakness
of
teachers
is
they
can
hardly
resist
the
tendency
to
be
didactic
they
have
the
knowledge
which
they
desire
to
find
in
their
pupils
and
they
can
not
help
expressing
it
and
endeavouring
to
pass
it
on
to
those
who
need
it
wealthy
men
who
care
not
how
they
but
true
as
jacotot
and
his
disciple
joseph
payne
were
never
tired
of
testifying
is
to
learn
and
it
is
seldom
that
teaching
has
this
effect
rousseau
saw
this
clearly
and
clearly
pointed
out
the
danger
of
didacticism
as
usual
he
by
exaggeration
laid
himself
open
to
an
answer
that
seems
to
refute
him
but
in
spite
of
this
we
feel
that
there
is
valuable
truth
underlying
what
he
says
like
not
explanations
given
in
long
discourses
says
he
people
pay
little
attention
to
them
and
retain
little
from
them
the
things
themselves
the
things
themselves
i
shall
never
repeat
often
enough
that
we
attach
too
much
importance
to
words
with
our
chattering
education
we
make
nothing
but
accordingly
rousseau
lays
down
the
rule
that
émile
is
not
to
learn
science
but
to
invent
it
pas
la
science
and
he
even
expects
him
to
invent
geometry
as
émile
is
not
supposed
to
be
a
young
pascal
but
only
an
ordinary
boy
with
extraordinary
development
such
a
requirement
is
obviously
absurd
and
herbart
has
reckoned
it
among
the
training
prescribed
is
in
fact
the
training
of
the
intellectual
athlete
and
the
trainer
may
put
the
body
through
its
exercises
much
more
easily
than
the
mind
of
this
the
practical
teacher
is
only
too
conscious
and
he
will
accept
advice
if
at
all
only
as
of
rousseau
says
obliged
to
learn
of
himself
makes
use
of
his
own
reason
and
not
that
of
others
for
to
give
no
weight
to
opinion
none
must
be
given
to
authority
and
the
more
part
of
our
mistakes
come
less
from
ourselves
than
from
other
people
from
this
constant
exercise
there
should
result
a
vigour
of
mind
like
that
which
the
body
gets
from
labour
and
fatigue
another
advantage
is
that
we
advance
only
in
proportion
to
our
strength
the
mind
like
the
body
carries
that
only
which
it
can
carry
when
the
understanding
makes
things
its
own
before
they
are
committed
to
memory
whatever
it
afterwards
draws
forth
belongs
to
it
but
if
the
memory
is
burdened
with
what
the
understanding
knows
nothing
about
we
are
in
danger
of
bringing
from
it
things
which
the
understanding
declines
to
again
he
writes
contradiction
we
get
much
more
clear
and
certain
notions
of
the
things
we
learn
thus
of
ourselves
than
of
those
we
derive
from
other
instruction
and
besides
not
accustoming
our
reason
to
bow
as
a
slave
before
authority
we
become
more
ingenious
in
finding
connexions
in
uniting
ideas
and
in
inventing
our
implements
than
when
we
take
all
that
is
given
us
and
let
our
minds
sink
into
indifference
like
the
body
of
a
man
who
always
has
his
clothes
put
on
for
him
is
waited
on
by
his
servants
and
drawn
about
by
his
horses
till
at
length
he
loses
the
strength
and
use
of
his
limbs
boileau
boasted
of
having
taught
racine
to
find
difficulty
in
rhyming
among
all
the
admirable
methods
of
shortening
the
study
of
the
sciences
we
might
have
need
that
some
one
should
give
us
a
way
of
learning
them
however
highly
we
may
value
our
gains
from
the
use
of
books
we
must
admit
that
in
some
ways
the
use
of
books
tends
to
the
neglect
of
powers
that
should
not
be
neglected
as
rousseau
wished
to
see
the
young
brought
up
without
books
he
naturally
looked
to
other
means
of
learning
especially
to
learning
by
the
eye
and
by
the
hand
much
is
now
said
about
using
the
hand
for
education
and
many
will
agree
with
rousseau
instead
of
making
a
child
stick
to
his
books
i
employ
him
in
a
workshop
his
hands
work
to
the
advantage
of
his
intellect
he
becomes
a
philosopher
while
he
thinks
he
is
becoming
simply
an
artisan
au
lieu
de
coller
un
enfant
sur
des
livres
si
je
dans
un
atelier
ses
mains
travaillent
au
profit
de
son
esprit
il
devient
philosophe
et
croît
in
these
essays
i
have
done
what
i
could
to
shew
the
best
that
each
reformer
has
left
us
in
case
i
have
been
obliged
to
confine
myself
to
his
words
attach
far
too
much
importance
to
words
said
rousseau
and
yet
it
is
by
words
and
words
only
that
rousseau
still
lives
and
for
the
sake
of
his
words
we
forget
his
deeds
of
the
morley
says
is
one
of
the
seminal
books
in
the
history
of
literature
it
cleared
away
the
accumulation
of
clogging
prejudices
and
obscure
inveterate
usage
which
made
education
one
of
the
dark
formalistic
arts
and
it
admitted
floods
of
light
and
air
into
nurseries
and
in
the
region
of
thought
it
set
us
free
from
the
renascence
and
it
did
more
than
this
it
announced
the
true
nature
of
the
calling
the
subject
you
have
to
act
in
these
words
we
have
the
starting
point
of
the
from
them
the
educator
gets
a
fresh
conception
of
his
task
we
grown
people
have
received
innumerable
impressions
which
forgotten
as
they
are
have
left
their
mark
behind
in
our
way
of
looking
at
things
and
as
we
advance
in
life
these
experiences
and
associations
cluster
around
everything
to
which
we
direct
our
attention
till
in
the
end
the
past
seems
to
dominate
the
present
and
to
us
is
but
what
is
but
to
the
child
the
present
with
its
revelations
and
the
future
which
will
be
more
a
bringer
of
new
things
are
all
engrossing
it
is
our
business
as
teachers
to
try
to
realize
how
the
world
looks
from
the
point
of
view
we
may
know
a
great
many
things
and
be
ready
to
teach
them
but
we
shall
have
little
success
unless
we
get
another
knowledge
which
we
can
not
teach
and
can
learn
only
by
patient
observation
a
knowledge
of
subject
to
be
acted
on
of
the
mind
of
our
pupils
and
what
goes
on
there
when
we
set
out
on
this
path
which
was
first
clearly
pointed
out
by
rousseau
teaching
becomes
a
new
occupation
with
boundless
possibilities
and
unceasing
interest
in
it
every
teacher
becomes
a
learner
for
we
have
to
study
the
minds
of
the
young
their
way
of
looking
at
things
their
habits
their
difficulties
their
likes
and
dislikes
how
they
are
stimulated
to
exertion
how
they
are
discouraged
how
one
mood
succeeds
another
what
we
need
we
may
well
devote
a
lifetime
to
acquiring
it
is
a
knowledge
of
the
human
mind
with
the
object
of
influencing
it
xv
basedow
and
the
philanthropinum
one
of
the
most
famous
movements
ever
made
in
educational
reform
was
started
in
the
last
century
by
john
bernard
basedow
basedow
was
born
at
hamburg
in
the
son
of
a
wigmaker
his
early
years
were
not
spent
in
the
ordinary
happiness
of
childhood
his
mother
he
describes
as
melancholy
almost
to
madness
and
his
father
was
severe
almost
to
brutality
it
was
the
intention
to
bring
up
his
son
to
his
own
business
but
the
lad
ran
away
and
engaged
himself
as
servant
to
a
gentleman
in
holstein
the
master
soon
perceived
what
had
never
occurred
to
the
father
that
the
youth
had
very
extraordinary
abilities
sent
home
with
a
letter
from
his
master
pointing
out
this
notable
discovery
basedow
was
allowed
to
renounce
the
paternal
calling
and
to
go
to
the
hamburg
grammar
school
where
he
was
under
reimarus
the
author
of
the
in
due
course
his
friends
managed
to
send
him
to
the
university
of
leipzig
to
prepare
himself
for
the
least
expensive
of
the
learned
clerical
basedow
however
was
not
a
man
to
follow
the
beaten
tracks
after
an
irregular
life
he
left
the
university
too
unorthodox
to
think
of
being
ordained
and
in
became
private
tutor
to
the
children
of
herr
von
quaalen
in
holstein
in
this
situation
his
talent
for
inventing
new
methods
of
teaching
first
showed
itself
he
knew
how
to
adapt
himself
to
the
capacity
of
the
children
and
he
taught
them
much
by
conversation
and
in
the
way
of
play
connecting
his
instruction
with
surrounding
objects
in
the
house
garden
and
fields
through
influence
he
next
obtained
a
professorship
at
soroe
in
denmark
where
he
lectured
for
eight
years
but
his
unorthodox
writings
raised
a
storm
of
opposition
and
the
government
finally
removed
him
to
the
gymnasium
at
altona
here
he
still
continued
his
efforts
to
change
the
prevailing
opinions
in
religious
matters
and
so
great
a
stir
was
made
by
the
publication
of
his
and
his
instruction
in
both
natural
and
biblical
religion
that
he
and
his
family
were
refused
the
communion
at
altona
and
his
books
were
excluded
under
a
heavy
penalty
from
lübeck
about
this
time
basedow
incited
by
turned
his
attention
to
a
fresh
field
of
activity
in
which
he
was
to
make
as
many
friends
as
in
theology
he
had
found
enemies
a
very
general
dissatisfaction
was
then
felt
with
the
condition
of
the
schools
physical
education
was
not
attempted
in
them
the
was
neglected
instruction
in
latin
and
greek
which
was
the
only
instruction
given
was
carried
on
in
a
mechanical
way
without
any
thought
of
improvement
the
education
of
the
poor
and
of
the
middle
classes
received
but
little
attention
says
raumer
in
those
days
for
most
children
a
sadly
harassed
period
instruction
was
hard
and
heartlessly
severe
grammar
was
caned
into
the
memory
so
were
portions
of
scripture
and
poetry
a
common
school
punishment
was
to
learn
by
heart
psalm
cxix
were
dismally
dark
no
one
conceived
it
possible
that
the
young
could
find
pleasure
in
any
kind
of
work
or
that
they
had
eyes
for
aught
besides
reading
and
writing
the
pernicious
age
of
louis
xiv
had
inflicted
on
the
poor
children
of
the
upper
class
hair
curled
by
the
barber
and
messed
with
powder
and
pomade
braided
coats
knee
breeches
silk
stockings
and
a
dagger
by
the
active
lively
children
a
perfect
ii
kant
gave
expression
to
a
very
feeling
when
he
said
that
what
was
wanted
in
education
was
no
longer
a
reform
but
a
revolution
here
then
was
a
good
scope
offered
for
innovators
and
basedow
was
a
prince
of
innovators
having
succeeded
in
interesting
the
danish
minister
bernstorff
in
his
plans
he
was
permitted
to
devote
himself
entirely
to
a
work
on
the
subject
of
education
whilst
retaining
his
income
from
the
altona
gymnasium
the
result
was
his
to
philanthropists
and
men
of
property
on
schools
and
studies
and
their
influence
on
the
public
in
which
he
announces
the
plan
of
his
in
this
address
he
calls
upon
princes
governments
dignitaries
of
the
church
lodges
if
they
loved
their
to
come
to
his
assistance
in
bringing
out
his
book
nor
did
he
call
in
vain
when
the
at
length
appeared
in
he
had
to
acknowledge
contributions
from
the
emperor
joseph
from
catherine
ii
of
russia
from
christian
vii
of
denmark
from
the
grand
prince
paul
and
many
other
celebrities
the
total
sum
received
being
over
while
basedow
was
travelling
about
in
to
get
subscriptions
he
spent
some
time
in
frankfurt
and
thence
made
an
excursion
to
ems
with
two
distinguished
companions
one
of
them
lavater
and
the
other
a
young
man
of
already
celebrated
as
the
author
of
von
berlichingen
and
the
of
of
personal
peculiarities
at
this
time
goethe
has
left
us
an
amusing
description
in
the
und
dichtung
but
we
must
accept
the
portrait
with
caution
the
sketch
was
thrown
in
as
an
artistic
contrast
with
that
of
lavater
and
no
doubt
exaggerates
those
features
in
which
the
antithesis
could
be
brought
out
with
best
effect
could
not
see
writes
goethe
more
marked
contrast
than
between
lavater
and
basedow
as
the
lines
of
countenance
were
free
and
open
to
the
beholder
so
were
contracted
and
as
it
were
drawn
inwards
eye
clear
and
benign
under
a
very
wide
on
the
other
hand
deep
in
his
head
small
black
sharp
gleaming
out
from
under
shaggy
eyebrows
whilst
frontal
bone
seemed
bounded
by
two
arches
of
the
softest
brown
hair
impetuous
rough
voice
his
rapid
and
sharp
utterances
a
certain
derisive
laugh
an
abrupt
changing
of
the
topic
of
conversation
and
whatever
else
distinguished
him
all
were
opposed
to
the
peculiarities
and
the
behaviour
by
which
lavater
had
been
making
us
goethe
approved
of
desire
to
make
all
instruction
lively
and
natural
and
thought
that
his
system
would
promote
mental
activity
and
give
the
young
a
fresher
view
of
the
world
but
he
finds
fault
with
the
and
prefers
the
of
comenius
in
which
subjects
are
presented
in
their
natural
connection
basedow
himself
says
goethe
was
not
a
man
either
to
edify
or
to
lead
other
people
although
the
object
of
his
journey
was
to
interest
the
public
in
his
philanthropic
enterprise
and
to
open
not
only
hearts
but
purses
and
he
was
able
to
speak
eloquently
and
convincingly
on
the
subject
of
education
he
spoilt
everything
by
his
tirades
against
prevalent
religious
belief
especially
on
the
subject
of
the
trinity
goethe
found
in
society
an
opportunity
of
if
not
enlightening
his
mind
so
he
bore
with
his
personal
peculiarities
though
apparently
with
great
difficulty
basedow
seems
to
have
delighted
in
worrying
his
associates
would
never
see
anyone
quiet
but
he
provoked
him
with
mocking
irony
in
a
hoarse
voice
or
put
him
to
confusion
by
an
unexpected
question
and
laughed
bitterly
when
he
had
gained
his
end
yet
he
was
pleased
when
the
object
of
his
jests
was
quick
enough
to
collect
himself
and
answer
in
the
same
so
far
goethe
was
his
match
but
he
was
nearly
routed
by
use
of
bad
tobacco
and
of
some
tinder
still
worse
with
which
he
was
constantly
lighting
his
pipe
and
poisoning
the
air
insufferably
he
soon
discovered
dislike
to
this
preparation
of
his
so
he
took
a
malicious
pleasure
in
using
it
and
dilating
upon
its
merits
here
is
an
odd
account
of
their
intercourse
during
their
stay
at
ems
goethe
went
a
great
deal
into
fashionable
society
make
up
for
these
dissipations
he
writes
always
passed
a
part
of
the
night
with
basedow
he
never
went
to
bed
but
dictated
without
cessation
occasionally
he
cast
himself
on
the
couch
and
slumbered
while
his
amanuensis
sat
quietly
pen
in
hand
ready
to
continue
his
work
when
the
author
should
once
more
give
free
course
to
his
thoughts
all
this
took
place
in
a
close
confined
chamber
filled
with
the
fumes
of
tobacco
and
the
odious
tinder
as
often
as
i
was
disengaged
from
a
dance
i
hastened
up
to
basedow
who
was
ready
at
once
to
speak
and
dispute
on
any
question
and
when
after
a
time
i
hurried
again
to
the
before
i
had
closed
the
door
behind
me
he
would
resume
the
thread
of
his
essay
as
composedly
as
if
he
had
been
engaged
with
nothing
it
was
through
a
friend
of
behrisch
whose
acquaintance
we
make
in
the
und
dichtung
that
basedow
became
connected
with
prince
leopold
of
dessau
behrisch
was
tutor
to
the
son
and
by
him
the
prince
was
so
interested
in
plans
that
he
determined
to
found
an
institute
in
which
they
should
be
realised
basedow
was
therefore
called
to
dessau
and
under
his
direction
was
opened
the
famous
philanthropinum
then
for
the
first
and
probably
for
the
last
time
a
school
was
started
in
which
use
and
wont
were
entirely
set
aside
and
everything
done
on
such
a
bold
enterprise
attracted
the
attention
of
all
interested
in
education
far
and
near
but
it
would
seem
that
few
parents
considered
their
own
children
on
whom
experiments
might
be
made
for
the
public
good
when
in
may
a
number
of
schoolmasters
and
others
collected
from
different
parts
of
germany
and
even
from
beyond
germany
to
be
present
by
invitation
at
an
examination
of
the
children
they
found
only
thirteen
pupils
in
the
philanthropinum
including
own
son
and
daughter
before
we
investigate
how
principles
were
embodied
in
the
philanthropinum
let
us
see
the
form
in
which
he
had
already
announced
them
the
great
work
from
which
all
children
were
to
be
taught
was
the
as
a
companion
to
this
was
published
the
of
for
parents
and
teachers
the
is
a
work
in
which
a
great
deal
of
information
about
things
in
general
is
given
in
the
form
of
dialogue
interspersed
with
tales
and
easy
poetry
except
in
bulk
it
does
not
seem
to
me
to
differ
very
materially
from
many
of
the
which
in
late
years
have
been
published
in
this
country
it
had
the
advantage
however
of
being
accompanied
by
a
set
of
engravings
to
which
the
text
referred
though
they
were
too
large
to
be
bound
up
with
it
the
of
basedow
put
forth
in
his
of
method
and
other
writings
are
those
of
rousseau
for
example
should
attend
to
nature
in
your
children
far
more
than
to
art
the
elegant
manners
and
usages
of
the
world
are
for
the
most
part
unnatural
these
come
of
themselves
in
later
years
treat
children
like
children
that
they
may
remain
the
longer
uncorrupted
a
boy
whose
acutest
faculties
are
his
senses
and
who
has
no
perception
of
anything
abstract
must
first
of
all
be
made
acquainted
with
the
world
as
it
presents
itself
to
the
senses
let
this
be
shown
him
in
nature
herself
or
where
this
is
impossible
in
faithful
drawings
or
models
thereby
can
he
even
in
play
learn
how
the
various
objects
are
to
be
named
comenius
alone
has
pointed
out
the
right
road
in
this
matter
by
all
means
reduce
the
wretched
exercises
of
the
elsewhere
he
gives
instances
of
the
sort
of
things
to
which
this
method
should
be
applied
man
here
he
would
use
pictures
of
foreigners
and
wild
men
also
a
skeleton
a
hand
in
spirits
and
other
objects
still
more
appropriate
to
a
surgical
museum
animals
only
such
animals
are
to
be
depicted
as
it
is
useful
to
know
about
because
there
is
much
that
ought
to
be
known
and
a
good
method
of
instruction
must
shorten
rather
than
increase
the
hours
of
study
articles
of
commerce
made
from
the
animals
may
also
be
exhibited
trees
and
plants
only
the
most
important
are
to
be
selected
of
these
the
seeds
also
must
be
shown
and
cubes
formed
of
the
different
woods
and
implements
are
to
be
explained
minerals
and
chemical
substances
mathematical
instruments
for
weighing
and
measuring
also
the
siphon
and
the
like
the
form
and
motion
of
the
earth
are
to
be
explained
with
globes
and
maps
trades
the
use
of
various
tools
is
to
be
taught
history
this
is
to
be
illustrated
by
engravings
of
historical
events
commerce
samples
of
commodities
may
be
produced
the
younger
children
should
be
shown
pictures
of
familiar
objects
about
the
house
and
its
surroundings
we
see
from
this
list
that
basedow
contemplated
giving
his
educational
course
the
charm
of
variety
indeed
with
that
candour
in
acknowledging
mistakes
which
partly
makes
amends
for
the
effrontery
too
common
in
the
trumpetings
of
his
own
performances
past
present
and
to
come
he
confesses
that
when
he
began
the
he
had
exaggerated
notions
of
the
amount
boys
were
capable
of
learning
and
that
he
had
subsequently
very
much
contracted
his
proposed
curriculum
and
even
revolution
which
was
to
introduce
so
much
new
learning
into
the
schools
could
not
afford
entirely
to
neglect
the
old
however
pleased
parents
might
be
with
the
novel
acquirements
of
their
children
they
were
not
likely
to
be
satisfied
without
the
usual
knowledge
of
latin
and
still
less
would
they
tolerate
the
neglect
of
french
which
in
german
polite
society
of
the
eighteenth
century
was
the
recognised
substitute
for
the
vulgar
tongue
these
then
must
be
taught
but
the
old
methods
might
be
abandoned
if
not
the
old
subjects
basedow
proposed
to
teach
both
french
and
latin
by
let
a
cabinet
of
models
or
something
of
the
kind
be
shown
the
children
let
them
learn
the
names
of
the
different
objects
in
latin
or
french
then
let
questions
be
asked
in
those
languages
and
the
right
answers
at
first
put
into
the
mouths
when
they
have
in
this
way
acquired
some
knowledge
of
the
language
they
may
apply
it
to
the
translating
of
an
easy
book
basedow
does
not
claim
originality
for
the
conversational
method
he
appeals
to
the
success
with
which
it
had
been
already
used
in
teaching
french
the
french
governesses
he
asks
without
vocabularies
and
grammars
first
by
conversation
then
by
reading
teach
their
language
very
successfully
and
very
rapidly
in
schools
of
from
thirty
to
forty
children
better
teachers
than
most
masters
in
our
latin
schools
on
the
subject
of
religion
the
instruction
was
to
be
quite
as
original
as
in
matters
of
less
importance
the
teachers
were
to
give
an
impartial
account
of
all
religions
and
nothing
but
was
to
be
inculcated
the
of
the
whole
system
was
to
according
to
the
natural
desires
and
inclinations
of
the
children
were
to
be
educated
and
directed
aright
but
in
no
case
to
be
suppressed
these
then
were
the
principles
and
the
methods
which
as
basedow
believed
were
to
revolutionise
education
through
the
success
of
the
philanthropinum
basedow
himself
as
we
might
infer
from
description
of
him
was
by
no
means
a
model
director
for
the
model
institution
but
he
was
fortunate
in
his
assistants
of
these
he
had
three
at
the
time
of
the
public
examination
of
whom
wolke
is
said
to
have
been
the
ablest
a
lively
description
of
the
examination
was
afterwards
published
by
herr
schummel
of
magdeburg
under
the
title
of
journey
to
it
purports
to
be
written
by
a
boy
of
twelve
years
old
and
to
describe
what
took
place
without
attempting
criticism
a
few
extracts
will
give
us
a
notion
of
the
instruction
carried
on
in
the
philanthropin
have
just
come
from
a
visit
with
my
father
to
the
philanthropinum
where
i
saw
herr
basedow
herr
wolke
herr
simon
herr
schweighäuser
and
the
little
philanthropinists
i
am
delighted
with
all
that
i
have
seen
and
hardly
know
where
to
begin
my
description
of
it
there
are
two
large
white
houses
and
near
them
a
field
with
trees
a
one
of
the
regular
scholars
but
of
those
they
call
famulants
a
poorer
class
who
were
servitors
us
at
the
door
and
asked
if
we
wished
to
see
herr
basedow
we
said
and
he
took
us
into
the
other
house
where
we
found
herr
basedow
in
a
writing
at
a
desk
we
came
at
an
inconvenient
time
and
herr
basedow
said
he
was
very
busy
he
was
very
friendly
however
and
promised
to
visit
us
in
the
evening
we
then
went
into
the
other
house
and
enquired
for
herr
by
him
they
were
taken
to
the
scholars
have
says
fred
hair
cut
very
short
and
no
is
employed
their
throats
are
quite
open
and
their
fall
back
over
their
further
on
he
describes
the
examination
little
ones
have
gone
through
the
oddest
performances
they
play
at
of
eight
or
ten
stand
in
a
line
like
soldiers
and
herr
wolke
is
officer
he
gives
the
word
in
latin
and
they
must
do
whatever
he
says
for
instance
when
he
says
they
all
shut
their
eyes
when
he
says
they
look
about
them
they
all
sew
like
tailors
they
draw
the
waxed
thread
like
the
cobblers
herr
wolke
gives
a
thousand
different
commands
in
the
drollest
fashion
another
game
hiding
game
i
will
also
teach
you
some
one
writes
a
name
and
hides
it
from
the
name
of
some
part
of
the
body
or
of
a
plant
or
animal
or
the
children
guess
what
it
is
whoever
guesses
right
gets
an
apple
or
a
piece
of
cake
one
of
the
visitors
wrote
and
told
the
children
it
was
a
part
of
the
body
then
the
guessing
began
one
guessed
another
another
another
and
so
forth
for
a
long
time
but
one
of
them
hit
it
at
last
next
herr
wolke
wrote
the
name
of
a
beast
a
quadruped
then
came
the
guesses
and
so
on
till
one
guessed
was
then
a
town
was
written
and
they
guessed
lisbon
madrid
paris
london
till
a
child
won
with
petersburg
they
had
another
game
which
was
this
herr
wolke
gave
the
command
in
latin
and
they
imitated
the
noises
of
different
animals
and
made
us
laugh
till
we
were
tired
they
roared
like
lions
crowed
like
cocks
mewed
like
cats
just
as
they
were
the
subject
that
was
next
handled
had
also
the
effect
of
making
the
strangers
laugh
till
a
severe
reproof
from
herr
wolke
restored
their
gravity
a
picture
was
brought
in
which
was
represented
a
woman
whose
person
indicated
the
approaching
arrival
of
another
subject
for
education
from
one
part
of
the
picture
it
also
appeared
that
the
prospective
mother
with
a
prodigality
of
forethought
had
got
ready
clothing
for
both
a
boy
and
a
girl
after
a
warning
from
herr
wolke
that
this
was
a
most
serious
and
important
subject
the
children
were
questioned
on
the
topics
the
picture
suggested
they
were
further
taught
the
debt
of
gratitude
they
owed
to
their
mothers
and
the
german
fiction
about
the
stork
was
dismissed
with
due
contempt
next
came
the
examination
in
arithmetic
here
there
seems
to
have
been
nothing
remarkable
except
that
all
the
rules
were
worked
from
the
arithmetic
herr
wolke
went
on
to
an
at
various
small
he
asked
the
children
what
he
should
draw
some
one
answered
he
then
pretended
he
was
drawing
a
lion
but
put
a
beak
to
it
whereupon
the
children
shouted
est
non
habent
rostrum
he
went
on
to
other
subjects
as
the
children
directed
him
sometimes
going
wrong
that
the
children
might
put
him
right
in
the
next
exercise
dice
were
introduced
and
the
children
threw
to
see
who
should
give
an
account
of
an
engraving
the
engravings
represented
workmen
at
their
different
trades
and
the
child
had
to
explain
the
process
the
tools
a
lesson
on
ploughing
and
harrowing
was
given
in
french
and
another
on
expedition
to
india
in
latin
four
of
the
pupils
translated
passages
from
curtius
and
from
bible
which
were
read
to
them
children
said
the
teacher
not
a
word
of
latin
a
year
listeners
were
well
pleased
with
the
latin
writes
fred
two
or
three
whom
i
heard
grumbling
that
this
was
all
play
and
that
if
cicero
livy
and
horace
were
introduced
it
would
soon
be
seen
what
was
the
value
of
philanthropinist
after
the
examination
two
comedies
were
acted
by
the
children
one
in
french
the
other
in
german
most
of
the
strangers
seem
to
have
left
dessau
with
a
favourable
impression
of
the
philanthropin
they
were
especially
struck
with
the
brightness
and
animation
of
the
children
how
far
did
the
philanthropinum
really
deserve
their
good
opinion
the
conclusion
to
which
we
are
driven
by
narrative
is
that
basedow
carried
to
excess
his
children
as
children
that
they
may
remain
the
longer
uncorrupted
and
that
the
philanthropinum
was
in
fact
nothing
but
a
good
surely
none
of
the
thirteen
children
who
were
the
subjects
of
experiments
could
have
been
more
than
ten
years
old
but
if
we
consider
system
to
have
been
intended
for
say
between
the
ages
of
six
and
ten
we
must
allow
that
it
possessed
great
merits
at
the
very
beginning
of
a
learning
it
has
always
been
too
much
the
custom
to
make
him
hate
the
sight
of
a
book
and
escape
at
every
opportunity
from
by
giving
him
difficult
tasks
and
neglecting
his
acutest
faculties
love
motion
and
noise
says
basedow
is
a
hint
from
yet
the
youngest
children
in
most
schools
are
expected
to
keep
quiet
and
to
sit
at
their
books
for
as
many
hours
as
the
youths
of
seventeen
or
eighteen
their
vivacity
is
repressed
with
the
cane
their
delight
in
exercising
their
hands
and
eyes
and
ears
is
taken
no
notice
of
and
they
are
required
to
keep
their
attention
fixed
on
subjects
often
beyond
their
comprehension
and
almost
always
beyond
the
range
of
their
interests
everyone
who
has
had
experience
in
teaching
boys
knows
how
hard
it
is
to
get
them
to
throw
themselves
heartily
into
any
task
whatever
and
probably
this
difficulty
arises
in
many
cases
from
the
habits
of
inattention
and
of
shirking
which
the
boys
have
acquired
almost
necessarily
from
the
dreariness
of
their
earliest
lessons
basedow
determined
to
change
all
this
and
in
the
philanthropin
no
doubt
he
succeeded
we
have
already
seen
some
of
the
expedients
by
which
he
sought
to
render
pleasurable
he
appealed
wherever
it
was
possible
to
the
senses
and
these
especially
the
sight
were
trained
with
great
care
by
exercises
such
as
drawing
shooting
at
a
mark
one
of
these
exercises
intended
to
give
quick
perception
bears
a
curious
likeness
to
what
has
since
been
practised
in
a
very
different
educational
system
a
picture
with
a
somewhat
varied
subject
was
exhibited
for
a
short
time
and
removed
the
boys
had
then
either
verbally
or
on
paper
to
give
an
account
of
it
naming
the
different
objects
in
proper
order
houdin
if
i
rightly
remember
tells
us
that
the
young
thieves
of
paris
are
required
by
their
masters
to
make
a
mental
inventory
of
the
contents
of
a
shop
window
which
they
see
only
as
they
walk
rapidly
by
other
exercises
of
the
philanthropinum
connected
the
pupils
with
more
honourable
callings
they
became
acquainted
with
both
skilled
and
unskilled
manual
labour
every
boy
was
taught
a
handicraft
such
as
carpentering
and
turning
and
was
put
to
such
tasks
as
threshing
corn
division
of
the
hours
was
the
following
eight
hours
for
sleep
eight
for
food
and
amusement
and
for
the
children
of
the
rich
six
hours
of
and
two
of
manual
labour
in
the
case
of
the
children
of
the
poor
he
would
have
the
division
of
the
last
eight
hours
inverted
and
would
give
for
two
and
for
manual
labour
six
the
development
of
the
body
was
specially
cared
for
in
the
philanthropinum
gymnastics
were
now
first
introduced
into
modern
schools
and
the
boys
were
taken
long
expeditions
on
commencement
i
believe
of
a
practice
now
common
throughout
germany
as
i
have
already
said
basedow
proved
a
very
unfit
person
to
be
at
the
head
of
the
model
institution
many
of
his
friends
agreed
with
herder
that
he
was
not
fit
to
have
calves
entrusted
to
him
much
less
children
he
soon
resigned
his
post
and
was
succeeded
by
campe
who
had
been
one
of
the
visitors
at
the
public
examination
campe
did
not
remain
long
at
the
philanthropinum
but
left
it
to
set
up
a
school
on
like
principles
at
hamburg
his
fame
now
rests
on
his
writings
for
the
young
one
of
crusoe
the
still
a
general
favourite
other
distinguished
men
became
connected
with
the
them
salzmann
and
matthison
the
the
number
of
pupils
rose
to
over
fifty
gathered
we
are
told
from
all
parts
of
europe
between
riga
and
lisbon
but
this
number
is
by
no
means
a
fair
measure
of
the
interest
nay
enthusiasm
which
the
experiment
excited
we
find
pastor
oberlin
raising
money
on
his
earrings
to
send
a
donation
we
find
the
philosopher
kant
prophesying
that
quite
another
race
of
men
would
grow
up
now
that
education
according
to
nature
had
been
introduced
these
hopes
were
disappointed
kant
confesses
as
much
in
the
following
passage
in
his
treatise
fancies
indeed
that
experiments
in
education
would
not
be
necessary
and
that
we
might
judge
by
the
understanding
whether
any
plan
would
turn
out
well
or
ill
but
this
is
a
great
mistake
experience
shows
that
often
in
our
experiments
we
get
quite
opposite
results
from
what
we
had
anticipated
we
see
too
that
since
experiments
are
necessary
it
is
not
in
the
power
of
one
generation
to
form
a
complete
plan
of
education
the
only
experimental
school
which
to
some
extent
made
a
beginning
in
clearing
the
road
was
the
institute
at
dessau
this
praise
at
least
must
be
allowed
it
notwithstanding
the
many
faults
which
could
be
brought
up
against
which
are
sure
to
show
themselves
when
we
come
to
the
results
of
our
experiments
and
which
merely
prove
that
fresh
experiments
are
necessary
it
was
the
only
school
in
which
the
teachers
had
liberty
to
work
according
to
their
own
methods
and
schemes
and
where
they
were
in
free
communication
both
among
themselves
and
with
all
learned
men
throughout
we
observe
here
that
kant
speaks
of
the
philanthropinum
as
a
thing
of
the
past
it
was
finally
closed
in
but
even
from
kant
we
learn
that
the
experiment
had
been
by
no
means
a
useless
one
the
conservatives
of
course
did
not
neglect
to
point
out
that
young
philanthropinists
when
they
left
school
were
not
in
all
respects
the
superiors
of
their
but
although
no
one
could
pretend
that
the
philanthropinum
had
effected
a
tithe
of
what
basedow
promised
and
the
of
throughout
europe
expected
it
had
introduced
many
new
ideas
which
in
time
had
their
influence
even
in
the
schools
of
the
opposite
party
moreover
teachers
who
had
been
connected
with
the
philanthropinum
founded
schools
on
similar
principles
in
different
parts
of
germany
and
switzerland
as
at
heidesheim
and
celebrated
school
at
schnepfenthal
which
is
i
believe
still
thriving
their
doctrines
too
made
converts
among
other
masters
the
most
celebrated
of
whom
was
meierotto
of
berlin
little
remains
to
be
said
of
basedow
he
lived
chiefly
at
dessau
earning
his
subsistence
by
private
tuition
but
giving
offence
by
his
irregularities
in
when
visiting
magdeburg
he
died
after
a
short
illness
in
his
year
his
last
words
were
wish

for

good

is
thus
the
law
holds
us
accountable
for
the
action
of
others
which
we
direct
by
the
extension
of
this
rule
we
immensely
increase
the
personality
of
great
writers
and
may
credit
them
with
vast
spheres
of
action
which
never
come
within
their
consciousness
no
man
gains
and
suffers
more
from
this
consideration
than
rousseau
on
the
one
hand
we
may
attribute
to
him
the
crimes
of
robespierre
and
on
the
other
pestalozzi
was
instigated
by
him
to
turn
to
farming
in
treating
of
rousseau
as
an
educational
reformer
i
passed
over
a
life
in
which
almost
every
incident
tends
to
weaken
the
effect
of
his
words
with
pestalozzi
we
must
turn
to
his
life
for
the
true
source
of
his
writings
and
the
best
comment
on
them
john
henry
pestalozzi
was
born
at
zurich
in
his
father
dying
when
he
was
five
years
old
he
was
brought
up
with
a
brother
and
sister
by
a
pious
and
mother
and
by
a
faithful
servant
who
had
comforted
the
father
in
his
last
hours
by
promising
to
stay
with
his
family
thus
pestalozzi
had
an
advantage
denied
to
rousseau
and
denied
as
it
would
seem
to
locke
there
was
scope
for
his
home
affections
and
the
head
was
not
developed
before
the
heart
when
he
was
sent
to
a
he
became
to
some
extent
the
laughing
stock
of
his
companions
who
dubbed
him
harry
oddity
of
foolborough
but
he
gained
their
by
his
unselfishness
it
was
remembered
that
on
the
shock
of
an
earthquake
when
teachers
and
taught
fled
from
the
school
building
harry
oddity
was
induced
to
go
back
and
bring
away
what
his
companions
considered
precious
his
holidays
he
spent
with
his
grandfather
the
pastor
of
a
village
some
three
miles
from
zurich
where
the
lad
learnt
the
condition
of
the
rural
poor
and
saw
what
a
good
man
could
do
for
them
he
always
looked
back
to
these
visits
as
an
important
element
in
his
education
best
way
for
a
child
to
acquire
the
fear
of
god
he
wrote
for
him
to
see
and
hear
a
true
the
example
so
affected
him
that
he
wished
to
follow
in
his
steps
and
he
became
a
student
of
theology
even
as
a
student
pestalozzi
proved
that
he
was
no
ordinary
man
in
his
time
there
was
great
intellectual
and
moral
enthusiasm
among
the
students
of
the
little
swiss
university
some
distinguished
professors
especially
bodmer
had
awakened
a
craving
for
the
old
swiss
virtues
of
plain
living
and
high
thinking
and
a
band
of
students
among
whom
lavater
was
leader
and
pestalozzi
played
a
prominent
part
became
eager
reformers
the
citizens
of
the
great
towns
like
geneva
and
zurich
had
become
in
effect
privileged
classes
and
as
their
spokesmen
the
geneva
magistrates
condemned
the
and
the
this
raised
the
indignation
of
the
reforming
students
at
zurich
and
though
their
organ
a
periodical
called
the
kept
clear
of
politics
one
muller
wrote
a
paper
which
contained
some
strong
language
and
this
was
held
to
be
proof
of
a
conspiracy
muller
fled
and
was
banished
pestalozzi
and
some
other
of
his
friends
were
imprisoned
the
was
suppressed
it
is
in
this
a
weekly
paper
edited
by
lavater
who
was
five
years
senior
that
we
have
earliest
writing
we
find
him
coming
forward
as
man
of
no
one
he
says
can
object
to
his
expressing
his
wishes
and
with
a
man
of
are
usually
hopes
among
other
wishes
he
says
would
that
some
one
would
draw
up
in
a
simple
manner
a
few
principles
of
education
intelligible
to
everybody
that
some
generous
people
would
then
share
the
expense
of
printing
so
that
the
pamphlet
might
be
given
to
the
public
for
nothing
or
next
to
nothing
i
would
then
have
clergymen
distribute
it
to
all
fathers
and
mothers
so
that
they
might
bring
up
their
children
in
a
rational
and
christian
manner
but
he
adds
this
is
asking
too
much
at
a
the
was
suppressed
because
privileged
knew
that
it
was
in
the
hands
of
their
opponents
pestalozzi
then
and
always
felt
keenly
the
oppression
to
which
the
peasants
were
exposed
and
he
spoke
of
as
men
on
stilts
who
must
descend
among
the
people
before
they
could
secure
a
natural
and
firm
position
he
also
satirises
them
in
some
of
his
fables
as
that
of
the
and
the
fishes
in
a
pond
brought
an
accusation
against
the
pike
who
were
making
great
ravages
among
them
the
judge
an
old
pike
said
that
their
complaint
was
well
founded
and
that
the
defendants
to
make
amends
should
allow
two
ordinary
fish
every
year
to
become
by
this
time
pestalozzi
had
given
up
theology
and
had
taken
to
the
law
now
under
the
influence
of
rousseau
or
rather
of
the
craving
for
a
simple
life
which
found
its
most
eloquent
expression
in
writing
pestalozzi
made
a
bonfire
of
his
mss
and
decided
on
becoming
a
farmer
there
was
another
person
concerned
in
this
decision
in
his
childhood
he
had
one
day
ventured
into
the
shop
of
one
of
the
leading
tradesmen
herr
schulthess
bent
on
procuring
for
his
farthings
some
object
of
delight
but
he
found
there
a
little
anna
schulthess
seven
years
his
senior
who
discouraged
his
extravagance
and
persuaded
him
to
keep
his
money
anna
and
he
since
those
days
had
become
at
all
to
the
satisfaction
of
her
parents
their
intimacy
had
been
strengthened
by
their
concern
for
a
common
friend
a
young
man
named
bluntschli
who
died
of
consumption
this
friend
three
years
older
than
pestalozzi
seems
to
have
understood
him
thoroughly
and
in
the
parting
advice
he
gave
him
there
was
a
warning
which
happily
for
the
general
good
was
in
after
years
neglected
am
going
said
bluntschli
you
will
be
left
alone
avoid
any
career
in
which
you
might
become
the
victim
of
your
own
goodness
and
trust
and
choose
some
quiet
life
in
which
you
will
run
no
risk
above
all
do
not
take
part
in
any
important
undertaking
without
having
at
your
side
a
man
who
by
his
cool
judgment
knowledge
of
men
and
things
and
unshakable
fidelity
may
be
able
to
protect
you
from
the
dangers
to
which
you
will
be
when
the
friendship
with
anna
schulthess
had
ripened
into
a
betrothal
pestalozzi
spent
a
year
in
the
neighbourhood
of
bern
learning
farming
under
a
man
then
famous
for
his
innovations
his
new
ideas
pestalozzi
absorbed
very
readily
had
come
to
him
he
says
political
visionary
though
with
many
profound
and
correct
attainments
views
and
anticipations
in
matters
political
i
went
away
from
him
just
as
great
an
agricultural
visionary
though
with
many
enlarged
and
correct
ideas
and
intentions
with
regard
to
during
his
he
kept
up
a
correspondence
with
his
betrothed
and
the
letters
of
both
which
have
been
preserved
differ
very
widely
from
in
general
of
himself
pestalozzi
gives
an
account
which
shows
that
in
part
at
least
he
could
see
himself
as
others
saw
him
he
writes
of
my
faults
which
appear
to
me
most
important
in
relation
to
the
situation
in
which
i
may
be
placed
in
are
improvidence
incautiousness
and
a
want
of
presence
of
mind
to
meet
unexpected
changes
in
my
prospects
of
my
great
and
indeed
very
reprehensible
negligence
in
all
matters
of
etiquette
and
generally
in
all
matters
which
are
not
in
themselves
of
importance
i
need
not
speak
anyone
may
see
them
at
first
sight
of
me
i
also
owe
you
the
open
confession
my
dear
that
i
shall
always
consider
my
duties
toward
my
beloved
partner
subordinate
to
my
duties
towards
my
country
and
that
although
i
shall
be
the
tenderest
husband
nevertheless
i
hold
myself
bound
to
be
inexorable
to
the
tears
of
my
wife
if
she
should
ever
attempt
to
restrain
me
by
them
from
the
direct
performance
of
my
duties
as
a
citizen
whatever
this
must
lead
to
my
wife
shall
be
the
confidante
of
my
heart
the
partner
of
all
my
most
secret
counsels
a
great
and
honest
simplicity
shall
reign
in
my
house
and
one
thing
more
my
life
will
not
pass
without
important
and
very
critical
undertakings
i
shall
not
forget
my
first
resolutions
to
devote
myself
wholly
to
my
country
i
shall
never
from
fear
of
man
refrain
from
speaking
when
i
see
that
the
good
of
my
country
calls
upon
me
to
speak
my
whole
heart
is
my
i
will
risk
all
to
alleviate
the
need
and
misery
of
my
what
consequences
may
the
undertakings
to
which
i
feel
myself
urged
on
draw
after
them
how
unequal
to
them
am
i
and
how
imperative
is
my
duty
to
show
you
the
possibility
of
the
great
dangers
which
they
may
bring
upon
me
my
dear
my
beloved
friend
i
have
now
spoken
candidly
of
my
character
and
my
aspirations
reflect
upon
everything
if
the
traits
which
it
was
my
duty
to
mention
diminish
your
respect
for
me
you
will
still
esteem
my
sincerity
and
you
will
not
think
less
highly
of
me
that
i
did
not
take
advantage
of
your
want
of
acquaintance
with
my
character
for
the
attainment
of
my
inmost
the
young
lady
addressed
was
worthy
of
her
lover
nobleness
such
elevation
of
character
reach
my
very
soul
said
she
with
equal
nobleness
she
encouraged
pestalozzi
in
his
schemes
and
took
the
consequences
without
a
murmur
during
their
long
married
life
of
years
full
of
new
ideas
about
farming
pestalozzi
now
thought
he
saw
his
way
to
making
a
fortune
he
took
some
poor
land
near
birr
not
far
from
zurich
and
persuaded
a
banking
firm
to
advance
money
with
which
he
proposed
to
cultivate
vegetables
and
madder
in
september
he
was
married
and
six
months
later
the
pair
settled
in
a
new
house
which
pestalozzi
had
built
on
his
land
but
in
spite
of
his
excellent
ideas
and
great
industry
his
speculation
failed
the
bankers
soon
withdrew
their
money
pestalozzi
was
not
cautious
enough
for
them
however
his
friends
prevented
an
immediate
collapse
but
before
he
had
any
reason
to
doubt
the
success
of
his
speculation
pestalozzi
had
begun
to
reproach
himself
with
being
engrossed
by
it
what
had
become
of
all
his
thoughts
for
the
people
was
he
not
spending
his
strength
entirely
to
gain
the
prosperity
of
himself
and
his
household
these
thoughts
came
to
him
with
all
the
more
force
when
a
son
was
born
to
him
and
at
this
time
they
naturally
connected
themselves
with
education
he
had
now
seen
a
good
deal
of
the
degraded
state
of
the
peasantry
how
were
they
to
be
raised
out
of
it
to
pestalozzi
there
seemed
one
answer
and
one
only
this
was
to
many
people
in
the
present
day
it
might
seem
that
when
quite
successful
would
qualify
labourers
to
become
clerks
this
was
not
the
notion
of
pestalozzi
rousseau
had
completely
freed
him
from
bondage
to
the
renascence
and
education
did
not
mean
to
him
a
training
in
the
use
of
books
he
looked
at
the
children
of
the
lowest
class
of
the
peasants
and
asked
himself
what
they
needed
to
raise
them
knowledge
would
not
do
it
thing
was
not
that
they
should
know
what
they
did
not
know
but
that
they
should
behave
as
they
did
not
and
the
road
to
right
action
lay
through
right
feeling
if
they
could
be
made
conscious
that
they
were
loved
and
cared
for
their
hearts
would
open
and
give
back
love
and
respect
in
return
more
than
this
they
must
be
taught
not
only
to
respect
their
elders
but
also
themselves
they
must
be
taught
to
help
themselves
and
contribute
to
their
own
maintenance
so
pestalozzi
resolved
to
take
into
his
own
house
some
of
the
very
poorest
children
to
bring
them
up
in
an
atmosphere
of
love
and
to
instruct
them
in
and
spinning
which
would
soon
partly
as
pestalozzi
hoped
wholly
pay
for
their
keep
thus
just
at
the
time
when
the
experiment
for
himself
failed
he
began
for
others
an
experiment
that
seemed
likely
to
add
indefinitely
to
his
difficulties
in
the
winter
of
the
first
children
were
taken
into
neuhof
the
consequences
to
his
wife
and
to
his
little
son
only
four
years
old
might
have
vanquished
the
courage
of
a
less
ardent
philanthropist
position
entailed
much
suffering
on
my
wife
he
writes
nothing
could
shake
us
in
our
resolve
to
devote
our
time
strength
and
remaining
fortune
to
the
simplification
of
the
instruction
and
domestic
education
of
the
these
children
at
first
not
more
than
in
number
pestalozzi
treated
as
his
own
they
worked
with
him
in
the
summer
in
the
garden
and
fields
in
winter
in
the
house
very
little
time
was
given
to
separate
lessons
the
children
often
learning
while
they
worked
with
their
hands
pestalozzi
held
that
talking
should
come
before
reading
and
writing
and
he
practised
them
in
conversation
on
subjects
taken
from
their
every
day
life
they
also
repeated
passages
from
the
bible
till
they
knew
them
by
heart
in
a
few
months
as
we
are
told
the
appearance
of
these
poor
little
creatures
had
entirely
changed
though
fed
only
on
bread
and
vegetables
they
looked
strong
and
hearty
and
their
faces
gained
an
expression
of
cheerfulness
frankness
and
intelligence
which
till
then
had
been
totally
wanting
they
made
good
progress
with
their
manual
work
as
well
as
with
the
associated
lessons
and
took
pleasure
in
both
in
all
they
said
and
did
they
seemed
to
show
their
consciousness
of
their
kind
care
of
them
this
experiment
naturally
drew
much
attention
to
it
and
when
it
had
gone
on
over
a
year
pestalozzi
was
induced
by
his
friend
iselin
of
basel
to
insert
in
the
a
paper
of
which
iselin
was
editor
an
for
an
institution
intended
to
provide
education
and
work
for
poor
country
in
this
appeal
pestalozzi
narrates
his
experience
have
proved
says
he
it
is
not
regular
work
that
stops
the
development
of
so
many
poor
children
but
the
turmoil
and
irregularity
of
their
lives
the
privations
they
endure
the
excesses
they
indulge
in
when
opportunity
offers
the
wild
rebellious
passions
so
seldom
restrained
and
the
hopelessness
to
which
they
are
so
often
a
prey
i
have
proved
that
children
after
having
lost
health
strength
and
courage
in
a
life
of
idleness
and
mendicity
have
when
once
set
to
regular
work
quickly
recovered
their
health
and
spirits
and
grown
rapidly
i
have
found
that
when
taken
out
of
their
abject
condition
they
soon
become
kindly
trustful
and
sympathetic
that
even
the
most
degraded
of
them
are
touched
by
kindness
and
that
the
eyes
of
the
child
who
has
been
steeped
in
misery
grow
bright
with
pleasure
and
surprise
when
after
years
of
hardship
he
sees
a
gentle
friendly
hand
stretched
out
to
help
him
and
i
am
convinced
that
a
heart
has
been
touched
the
consequences
will
be
great
for
his
development
and
entire
moral
pestalozzi
therefore
would
have
the
very
poorest
children
brought
up
in
private
establishments
where
agriculture
and
industry
were
combined
and
where
they
would
learn
to
work
steadily
and
carefully
with
their
hands
the
chief
part
of
their
time
being
devoted
to
this
manual
work
and
their
instruction
and
education
being
associated
with
it
and
he
asks
for
support
in
greatly
increasing
the
establishment
he
has
already
begun
encouraged
by
the
support
he
received
and
still
more
by
his
love
for
the
children
and
his
own
too
sanguine
disposition
pestalozzi
enlarged
his
undertaking
the
consequence
was
bankruptcy
several
causes
conspired
to
bring
about
this
result
whatever
he
might
do
for
the
children
he
could
not
educate
the
parents
and
these
were
many
of
them
beggars
with
the
ordinary
vices
of
their
class
with
the
usual
discernment
of
such
people
they
soon
came
to
the
conclusion
that
pestalozzi
was
making
a
fortune
out
of
their
labour
so
they
haunted
neuhof
treated
pestalozzi
with
the
greatest
insolence
and
often
induced
their
children
to
run
away
in
their
new
clothes
this
would
account
for
much
but
there
was
another
cause
of
failure
that
accounted
for
a
great
deal
more
this
was
extreme
incapacity
as
an
administrator
even
his
industrial
experiment
he
carried
on
in
such
a
way
that
it
proved
a
source
of
expense
rather
than
of
profit
he
says
himself
that
contrary
to
his
own
principles
which
should
have
led
him
to
begin
at
the
beginning
and
lay
a
good
foundation
in
teaching
he
put
the
children
to
work
that
was
too
difficult
for
them
wanted
them
to
spin
fine
thread
before
their
hands
got
steadiness
and
skill
by
exercise
on
the
coarser
kind
and
to
manufacture
muslin
before
they
could
turn
out
cotton
goods
i
was
aware
of
it
he
adds
was
deeply
involved
in
debt
and
the
greater
part
of
my
dear
property
and
expectations
had
as
it
were
in
an
instant
gone
up
in
the
precise
arrangement
made
with
the
creditors
we
do
not
know
the
bare
facts
remain
that
the
children
were
sent
away
and
that
the
land
was
let
for
the
benefit
but
pestalozzi
remained
in
the
house
this
was
settled
in
we
have
now
come
to
the
most
gloomy
period
in
history
a
period
of
eighteen
years
and
those
the
best
years
in
a
life
which
pestalozzi
spent
in
great
distress
from
poverty
without
and
doubt
and
despondency
within
when
he
got
into
difficulties
his
friends
he
tells
us
loved
him
without
hope
the
whole
surrounding
district
it
was
everywhere
said
that
i
was
a
lost
man
that
nothing
more
could
be
done
for
his
only
too
elegant
country
house
we
are
told
often
wanted
money
bread
fuel
to
protect
himself
against
hunger
and
years
a
time
for
a
soul
like
his
to
wait
history
passes
lightly
over
such
a
period
ten
twenty
thirty
makes
but
a
cipher
difference
if
nothing
great
happens
in
them
but
with
what
agony
must
he
have
seen
day
after
day
year
after
year
gliding
by
who
in
his
fervent
soul
longed
to
labour
for
the
good
of
mankind
and
yet
looked
in
vain
for
the
opportunity
palmer
but
he
who
was
always
ready
to
sacrifice
himself
for
others
now
found
someone
and
that
a
stranger
ready
to
make
a
great
sacrifice
for
him
a
servant
named
elizabeth
naef
heard
of
the
disaster
and
distress
at
neuhof
and
her
master
having
just
died
she
resolved
to
go
to
the
rescue
at
first
pestalozzi
refused
her
help
he
did
not
wish
her
to
share
the
poverty
of
his
household
and
he
felt
himself
out
of
sympathy
with
her
form
of
piety
but
elizabeth
declared
she
had
come
to
stay
and
when
pestalozzi
found
he
could
not
shake
her
determination
he
consented
saying
you
will
find
after
all
that
god
is
in
our
house
to
this
pious
sensible
but
illiterate
peasant
woman
pestalozzi
was
fond
of
tracing
many
of
his
ideas
she
was
the
original
of
his
and
it
was
of
her
he
wrote
sun
pursues
its
path
from
morning
to
evening
yet
your
eye
detects
no
movement
your
ear
no
sound
even
when
it
goes
down
you
know
that
it
will
rise
again
and
continue
to
ripen
the
fruits
of
the
earth
extreme
as
it
may
seem
i
am
not
ashamed
to
say
that
this
is
an
image
of
gertrude
as
of
every
woman
who
makes
her
house
a
temple
of
the
living
god
and
wins
heaven
for
her
husband
and
and
she
was
invaluable
at
neuhof
and
restored
comfort
to
the
household
in
after
years
she
managed
the
establishment
at
yverdun
and
married
one
of
the
krüsis
who
were
assistants
writing
of
the
gloomy
years
at
neuhof
pestalozzi
afterwards
said
head
was
grey
yet
i
was
still
a
child
with
a
heart
in
which
all
the
foundations
of
life
were
shaken
i
still
pursued
in
those
stormy
times
my
favourite
object
but
my
way
was
one
of
prejudice
of
passion
and
of
but
with
pestalozzi
had
grown
the
habit
of
his
soul
and
in
his
writings
at
neuhof
at
this
period
we
find
no
traces
of
this
prejudice
passion
and
error
from
which
he
supposes
himself
to
have
suffered
he
certainly
did
not
abandon
his
love
of
humanity
and
in
his
sacrifice
for
it
he
sought
a
religious
basis
in
these
neuhof
days
he

quoted
by
guimps
trans
whatever
were
his
doubts
and
difficulties
he
never
swerved
from
pursuing
the
great
object
of
his
life
and
nothing
could
cloud
his
mind
as
to
the
true
method
of
attaining
that
object
as
he
afterwards
wrote
to
gessner
while
i
was
the
sport
of
men
who
condemned
me
i
never
lost
sight
for
a
moment
of
the
object
i
had
in
view
which
was
the
removal
of
the
causes
of
the
misery
that
i
saw
on
all
sides
of
me
my
strength
too
kept
on
increasing
and
my
own
misfortunes
taught
me
valuable
truths
i
knew
the
people
as
no
one
else
did
what
deceived
no
one
else
always
deceived
me
but
what
deceived
everybody
else
deceived
me
no
longer
my
own
sufferings
have
enabled
me
to
understand
the
sufferings
of
the
people
and
their
causes
as
no
man
without
suffering
can
understand
them
i
suffered
what
the
people
suffered
and
saw
them
as
no
one
else
saw
them
and
strange
as
it
may
seem
i
was
never
more
profoundly
convinced
of
the
fundamental
truths
on
which
i
had
based
my
undertaking
than
when
i
saw
that
i
had
guimps
pestalozzi
still
had
a
few
friends
who
did
not
despise
the
dreamer
of
dreams
among
them
was
the
editor
of
the
iselin
this
friend
encouraged
him
to
write
and
there
soon
appeared
in
the
a
series
of
reflexions
under
the
title
of
evening
hour
of
a
not
many
editors
would
have
printed
these
aphorisms
and
they
attracted
little
or
no
attention
at
the
time
but
they
have
proved
worth
attending
to
fruit
of
past
years
they
are
says
raumer
the
same
time
the
of
the
years
that
were
to
come
the
plan
and
key
to
his
action
in
pedagogy
the
drawing
of
the
architect
of
genius
contains
his
work
even
though
the
architect
himself
has
not
skill
enough
to
carry
out
his
own
quoted
by
otto
fischer
what
was
the
connexion
between
belief
at
this
season
and
complete
belief
in
dogmatic
christianity
the
question
is
one
that
will
always
be
asked
and
can
never
i
think
be
fully
answered
in
the
days
preceding
the
french
revolution
it
was
a
proof
of
wisdom
to
ever
to
the
sunnier
side
of
doubt
and
cling
to
faith
even
though
the
faith
were
the
forms
of
see
but
pestalozzi
did
far
more
than
this
he
traced
all
virtue
and
strength
in
the
people
to
belief
in
the
fatherhood
of
god
and
he
saw
in
unbelief
the
severance
of
all
the
bonds
of
society
the
does
not
indeed
use
the
phrases
common
among
christians
but
that
he
was
indeed
a
christian
is
established
not
only
by
the
general
tone
of
his
aphorisms
but
still
more
clearly
by
his
last
words
man
of
god
who
with
his
sufferings
and
death
has
restored
to
humanity
the
lost
feeling
of
the
disposition
towards
god
is
the
redeemer
of
the
world
he
is
the
sacrificed
priest
of
the
lord
he
is
the
mediator
between
god
and
mankind
his
teaching
is
pure
justice
educating
philosophy
of
the
people
it
is
the
revelation
of
god
the
father
to
the
lost
race
of
his
the
remaining
almost
unnoticed
friends
urged
him
to
write
something
in
a
more
popular
form
so
he
set
to
work
on
a
tale
which
should
depict
the
life
of
the
peasantry
and
shew
the
causes
of
their
degradation
and
the
cure
with
extraordinary
rapidity
he
wrote
between
the
lines
of
an
old
account
book
the
first
part
of
his
and
the
book
which
was
complete
in
itself
and
through
the
good
offices
of
iselin
of
the
soon
found
a
publisher
suddenly
sprang
into
immense
popularity
a
popularity
of
which
nothing
but
the
could
ever
have
deprived
it
in
the
works
of
a
great
artist
we
see
natural
objects
represented
with
perfect
fidelity
and
yet
with
a
life
breathed
into
them
by
genius
which
is
wanting
or
at
least
is
not
visible
to
common
eyes
in
the
originals
just
so
do
we
find
swiss
peasant
life
depicted
by
pestalozzi
the
delineation
is
evidently
true
to
nature
and
at
the
same
time
shows
nature
as
she
reveals
herself
to
genius
but
for
this
work
something
more
than
genius
was
necessary
sympathy
and
love
in
the
preface
to
the
first
edition
he
says
that
which
i
here
relate
and
which
i
have
for
the
most
part
seen
and
heard
myself
in
the
course
of
an
active
life
i
have
taken
care
not
once
to
add
my
own
opinion
to
what
i
saw
and
heard
the
people
themselves
saying
feeling
believing
judging
and
in
a
later
edition
he
says
desired
nothing
then
and
i
desire
nothing
else
now
as
the
object
of
my
life
but
the
welfare
of
the
people
whom
i
love
and
whom
i
feel
to
be
miserable
as
few
feel
them
to
be
miserable
because
i
have
with
them
borne
their
sufferings
as
few
have
borne
wherever
german
was
read
this
book
excited
vast
interest
and
though
it
seemed
to
most
people
only
a
good
tale
it
met
with
some
more
discerning
readers
the
bern
agricultural
society
sent
the
author
their
thanks
and
a
gold
medal
and
pestalozzi
was
at
once
recognised
as
a
man
who
understood
the
peasantry
and
had
good
ideas
for
raising
them
the
book
is
and
must
remain
a
classic
but
pestalozzi
in
his
zeal
to
spread
the
truth
added
again
and
again
and
these
became
less
and
less
popular
in
the
method
of
exposition
here
and
there
we
get
glimpses
of
the
trials
pestalozzi
had
gone
through
in
his
industrial
experiment
love
and
patience
he
writes
which
gertrude
bore
with
the
disorderly
and
untrained
little
ones
was
almost
past
belief
their
eyes
were
often
anywhere
but
on
their
yarn
so
that
this
would
now
be
too
thick
and
now
too
thin
when
they
had
spoiled
it
they
would
watch
for
a
moment
when
gertrude
was
not
looking
and
throw
it
out
of
the
window
by
the
handful
until
they
found
that
she
discovered
the
trick
when
she
weighed
their
work
at
p
and
in
this
connexion
pestalozzi
preached
his
doctrine
of
perfect
attainment
you
do
blindfold
said
harry
do
at
we
are
told
quite
unable
to
explain
her
method
in
words
and
here
no
doubt
pestalozzi
was
speaking
of
himself
but
like
gertrude
he
let
fall
some
significant
remark
which
went
to
the
root
of
the
whole
matter
of
as
an
instance
we
may
take
what
gertrude
said
to
the
schoolmaster
should
do
for
the
children
what
their
parents
fail
to
do
for
them
the
reading
writing
and
arithmetic
are
not
after
all
what
they
most
need
it
is
all
well
and
good
for
them
to
learn
something
but
the
really
important
thing
for
them
is
to
when
this
truth
is
fully
realized
by
teachers
and
school
managers
there
will
be
some
hope
for
national
education
gertrude
exerted
herself
to
develop
very
early
the
manual
dexterity
of
her
children
she
was
in
no
haste
for
them
to
learn
to
read
and
write
but
she
took
pains
to
teach
them
early
how
to
speak
for
as
she
said
what
use
is
it
for
a
person
to
be
able
to
read
and
write
if
he
can
not
speak
since
reading
and
writing
are
only
an
artificial
sort
of
she
did
not
adopt
the
tone
of
an
instructor
towards
the
children
and
her
verbal
instruction
seemed
to
vanish
in
the
spirit
of
her
real
activity
in
which
it
always
had
its
source
the
result
of
her
system
was
that
each
child
was
skilful
intelligent
and
active
to
the
full
extent
that
its
age
and
development
p
in
this
book
we
see
that
knowledge
is
treated
as
valueless
unless
it
has
a
basis
in
action
pastor
was
soon
convinced
that
all
verbal
instruction
in
so
far
as
it
aims
at
true
human
wisdom
and
at
the
highest
goal
of
this
wisdom
true
religion
ought
to
be
subordinated
to
a
constant
training
in
practical
domestic
labour
so
he
strove
to
lead
the
children
without
many
words
to
a
quiet
industrious
life
and
thus
to
lay
the
foundations
of
a
silent
worship
of
god
and
love
of
humanity
to
this
end
he
connected
every
word
of
his
brief
religious
teachings
with
their
actual
experience
so
that
when
he
spoke
of
god
and
eternity
it
seemed
to
them
as
if
he
were
speaking
of
father
and
mother
house
and
home
in
short
of
the
things
with
which
they
were
most
thus
he
built
on
the
foundation
laid
by
the
schoolmaster
who
for
the
heads
as
he
did
for
their
hearts
and
demanded
that
whatever
entered
them
should
be
plain
and
clear
as
the
silent
moon
in
the
sky
to
insure
this
he
taught
them
to
see
and
hear
with
accuracy
and
cultivated
their
powers
of
with
all
his
love
for
the
children
an
element
of
severity
was
not
wanting
pestalozzi
maintained
that
was
only
useful
in
the
education
of
men
when
in
conjunction
with
fear
for
they
must
learn
to
root
out
thorns
and
thistles
which
they
never
do
of
their
own
accord
but
only
under
compulsion
and
in
consequence
of
just
at
the
end
of
the
book
appoints
a
commission
to
report
on
the
success
of
the
bonal
experiment
and
pestalozzi
makes
him
give
the
following
order
insure
thoroughness
there
must
be
among
the
examiners
men
skilled
in
law
and
finance
merchants
clergymen
government
officials
schoolmasters
and
physicians
women
of
different
ranks
and
conditions
of
who
shall
view
the
matter
with
their
eyes
and
be
sure
there
is
nothing
visionary
in
the
in
this
respect
pestalozzi
is
in
advance
of
us
still
no
woman
has
yet
sat
on
an
educational
commission
thus
we
find
pestalozzi
at
the
age
of
turning
author
and
for
the
next
six
or
seven
years
he
worked
indefatigably
with
his
pen
most
men
of
genius
have
some
leading
purpose
which
unites
their
varied
activities
and
this
was
specially
true
of
pestalozzi
he
never
lost
sight
of
his
one
object
which
was
the
elevation
of
the
people
and
this
he
held
to
be
attainable
only
by
means
of
education
properly
so
called
the
success
of
the
first
part
of
and
he
now
endeavoured
to
turn
to
account
in
spreading
true
ideas
of
education
with
this
intent
he
published
and
eliza
my
second
book
for
the
which
was
a
kind
of
commentary
on
and
but
the
public
wished
to
be
amused
not
taught
and
the
book
was
a
failure
he
was
thus
driven
into
the
attempt
already
mentioned
to
catch
the
public
ear
by
continuing
and
thus
endangering
his
first
and
as
it
proved
his
only
great
success
in
literature
to
gain
circulation
for
his
ideas
he
also
started
a
weekly
paper
called
the
and
issued
it
regularly
throughout
the
year
but
the
subscribers
were
so
few
that
he
was
then
obliged
to
give
it
up
i
have
not
the
smallest
doubt
that
it
was
as
guimps
says
full
of
wisdom
but
not
the
kind
of
wisdom
that
readers
of
periodicals
are
likely
to
care
for
in
the
we
get
a
hint
of
the
analogy
between
the
development
of
the
plant
and
of
the
man
this
analogy
often
as
it
had
been
observed
before
was
never
before
so
fruitful
as
it
became
in
the
hands
of
pestalozzi
and
froebel
the
passage
quoted
by
guimps
is
this
me
summer
day
that
man
formed
from
the
dust
of
the
earth
grows
and
ripens
like
the
plant
rooted
in
the
between
the
close
of
the
year
and
pestalozzi
did
not
publish
anything
though
he
had
become
famous
had
made
the
acquaintance
of
the
greatest
men
in
germany
such
as
goethe
wieland
herder
and
fichte
and
had
been
declared
a
of
the
french
republic
together
with
bentham
tom
payne
wilberforce
clarkson
washington
madison
klopstock
kozciusko
he
was
nearly
starving
and
naturally
enough
in
that
state
of
affairs
both
private
and
public
he
was
in
great
despondency
as
we
have
seen
his
whole
life
and
work
were
founded
on
religion
and
on
the
only
religion
possible
for
us
the
christian
religion
but
carried
away
by
his
political
radicalism
he
seems
at
this
time
to
have
doubted
whether
christianity
was
more
than
the
highest
human
wisdom
in
october
he
wrote
to
a
friend
in
berlin
doubt
not
because
i
look
on
doubt
as
the
truth
but
because
the
sum
of
the
impressions
of
my
life
has
driven
faith
with
its
blessings
from
my
soul
thus
impelled
by
my
fate
i
see
nothing
more
in
christianity
but
the
purest
and
noblest
teaching
of
the
victory
of
the
spirit
over
the
flesh
the
one
possible
means
of
raising
our
nature
to
its
true
nobility
or
in
other
words
of
establishing
the
empire
of
the
reason
over
the
senses
by
the
development
of
the
purest
feelings
of
the
if
this
was
the
lowest
point
to
which
faith
sank
in
the
days
of
the
revolution
it
remained
for
practical
purposes
higher
than
the
faith
of
most
professing
christians
then
and
since
at
this
time
we
find
him
complaining
agriculture
swallows
up
all
my
time
i
am
longing
for
winter
with
its
leisure
my
time
passes
like
a
he
was
then
years
of
age
and
seemed
to
himself
to
have
done
nothing
another
five
years
he
had
to
wait
before
he
found
an
opportunity
for
action
during
this
time
impelled
by
fichte
he
endeavoured
to
give
his
ideas
philosophic
completeness
and
after
labouring
for
three
years
with
almost
incredible
toil
he
published
in
his
into
the
course
of
nature
in
the
development
of
the
human
this
book
is
pronounced
even
by
his
biographer
guimps
to
be
and
obscure
and
says
pestalozzi
understood
but
even
in
this
book
there
was
much
wisdom
had
the
world
cared
to
learn
but
the
world
had
then
no
place
for
pestalozzi
and
as
he
says
at
the
end
of
this
book
even
asking
whether
the
fault
was
his
or
it
crushed
him
with
its
iron
hammer
as
the
mason
crushes
a
useless
he
was
however
not
actually
crushed
and
a
place
was
in
time
found
for
him
the
world
might
be
pardoned
for
neglecting
an
which
even
a
biographer
finds
and
but
why
could
it
see
nothing
in
another
book
which
pestalozzi
published
in
the
same
year
to
my
abc
book
or
according
to
its
later
title
a
series
of
apologues
as
witty
and
wise
as
those
of
lessing
as
i
have
said
already
there
seems
a
marked
distinction
between
thinkers
and
doers
at
least
in
education
and
we
seldom
find
a
man
great
in
both
but
with
all
his
weakness
as
a
practical
man
pestalozzi
proved
great
both
as
a
thinker
and
a
doer
he
not
only
thought
out
what
should
be
done
but
he
also
made
splendid
efforts
to
do
it
his
first
attempt
at
neuhof
was
as
we
have
seen
all
his
own
so
was
the
next
at
stanz
but
afterwards
he
had
to
work
with
others
and
the
work
would
have
come
to
a
standstill
if
he
had
not
gained
the
of
the
magistrates
the
parents
of
the
children
and
his
own
assistants
so
he
never
again
had
the
free
hand
or
at
least
the
free
thought
which
bore
such
good
fruit
in
his
enforced
cessation
from
practice
in
the
years
between
and
it
is
well
then
to
ask
as
his
biographer
guimps
has
asked
what
was
the
main
outcome
of
thought
before
he
plunged
into
action
a
second
time
in
pestalozzi
set
himself
to
find
a
means
of
rescuing
the
people
from
their
poverty
and
degradation
this
he
held
would
last
as
long
as
their
moral
and
intellectual
poverty
lasted
so
there
was
no
hope
except
in
an
education
that
should
make
them
better
and
more
intelligent
in
studying
the
children
even
of
the
most
degraded
parents
he
found
the
seeds
as
it
were
of
a
wealth
of
faculties
sentiments
tastes
and
capabilities
which
if
developed
might
make
them
reasonable
and
upright
human
beings
but
what
was
called
education
did
nothing
of
the
kind
instead
of
developing
the
noblest
part
of
the
nature
it
neglected
this
entirely
and
bringing
to
the
child
the
knowledge
ideas
and
feelings
of
others
it
tried
to
make
him
them
so
did
little
beyond
stifling
the
individuality
under
a
mass
of
borrowed
ideas
the
schoolmaster
worked
as
it
were
from
without
to
within
this
pestalozzi
would
change
and
make
education
begin
in
the
child
and
work
from
within
outwards
acting
on
this
principle
he
sought
for
some
means
of
developing
the
inborn
faculties
and
he
found
as
he
says
develops
all
the
powers
of
humanity
by
exercising
them
they
increase
with
aph
no
means
can
be
found
of
exercising
the
higher
faculties
which
can
be
compared
with
the
actual
relations
of
daily
life
so
pestalozzi
declares
pure
sentiment
of
truth
and
wisdom
is
formed
in
the
narrow
circle
of
the
relationships
which
affect
us
the
circumstances
which
suggest
our
actions
and
the
common
knowledge
which
we
can
not
do
and
taking
as
his
the
needs
desires
and
connexions
of
actual
life
he
was
naturally
led
to
associate
the
work
of
the
body
with
that
of
the
mind
to
develop
industry
and
study
side
by
side
to
combine
the
workshop
and
the
school
with
regard
to
instruction
he
was
never
tired
of
insisting
on
the
importance
of
thorough
mastery
in
the
first
elements
and
there
was
to
be
no
advance
till
this
mastery
was
attained
see
what
says
p
schools
he
says
no
substitute
an
artificial
method
of
words
for
the
truer
method
of
nature
which
knows
no
hurry
but
in
this
account
of
doctrine
before
i
have
as
usual
followed
guimps
according
to
him
pestalozzi
had
discovered
principle
which
settles
the
law
of
development
and
is
the
fundamental
principle
of
this
principle
guimps
briefly
states
as
follows
the
real
knowledge
useful
powers
and
noble
sentiments
that
a
man
can
acquire
are
but
the
extension
of
his
individuality
by
the
development
of
the
powers
and
faculties
that
god
has
put
in
him
and
by
their
assimilation
of
the
elements
supplied
by
the
outer
world
there
exists
for
this
development
and
the
work
of
assimilation
a
natural
and
necessary
order
an
order
which
the
school
mostly
sets
at
now
we
come
to
the
period
of
practical
activity
in
switzerland
was
overrun
by
the
french
everything
was
remodelled
after
the
french
pattern
and
in
conformity
with
the
existing
phase
in
the
model
country
the
government
of
switzerland
was
declared
to
be
in
the
hands
of
five
pestalozzi
was
a
radical
and
he
at
once
set
to
work
to
serve
the
new
government
with
his
pen
the
directors
gladly
welcomed
such
an
ally
as
the
author
of
and
and
they
made
him
editor
of
a
newspaper
intended
to
diffuse
the
revolutionary
principles
among
the
people
naturally
enough
they
supposed
that
he
like
other
people
something
but
when
asked
what
he
wanted
he
replied
simply
that
he
wished
to
be
a
schoolmaster
the
directors
especially
le
grand
took
a
genuine
interest
in
education
and
were
quite
willing
that
pestalozzi
should
be
allowed
a
free
hand
in
his
they
therefore
agreed
to
find
the
funds
with
which
pestalozzi
might
open
a
new
institution
in
aargau
but
the
editorship
and
the
plans
for
the
new
institution
came
to
an
abrupt
ending
the
catholic
cantons
did
not
acquiesce
in
giving
up
their
local
liberties
and
being
subjected
to
a
new
government
in
the
hands
of
men
whom
they
regarded
as
heretics
and
even
atheists
consequently
those
missionaries
of
enlightenment
the
french
troops
at
once
fell
upon
them
and
slaughtered
many
without
distinction
of
age
or
sex
the
french
we
are
told
did
not
expect
to
meet
with
resistance
so
their
light
became
lightning
and
struck
dead
the
stupid
people
who
could
not
or
would
not
see
it
is
michelet
who
speaks
ferocious
at
this
ferocity
at
stanz
in
september
was
in
secret
disapproved
of
by
the
directors
who
were
nominally
responsible
for
it
but
all
they
could
do
was
to
provide
in
a
measure
for
the
infirm
old
people
the
orphans
and
other
children
who
were
left
totally
destitute
le
grand
proposed
to
pestalozzi
that
he
should
for
the
present
give
up
his
other
plans
and
go
to
stanz
which
is
on
the
lake
of
lucerne
to
take
charge
of
the
orphan
and
destitute
children
pestalozzi
was
not
the
man
to
refuse
such
a
task
as
this
he
at
once
set
out
some
buildings
connected
with
an
ursuline
convent
were
without
the
consent
of
the
nuns
made
over
to
him
workmen
were
employed
upon
them
and
as
soon
as
a
single
room
could
be
inhabited
pestalozzi
received
forty
children
into
it
this
was
in
january
in
the
middle
of
a
remarkably
cold
winter
thus
under
circumstances
perhaps
less
unfavourable
than
they
seemed
began
the
five
trial
of
pure
pestalozzianism
the
physical
difficulties
were
immense
at
first
pestalozzi
and
all
the
children
were
shut
up
day
and
night
in
a
single
room
he
had
throughout
no
helper
of
any
kind
but
one
female
servant
and
he
had
to
do
everything
for
the
children
even
what
was
most
menial
and
disgusting
as
soon
as
possible
the
number
was
increased
and
before
long
was
nearly
eighty
some
of
the
children
having
to
go
out
to
sleep
but
great
as
were
the
material
difficulties
those
arising
from
the
opposition
and
hatred
of
the
people
he
came
to
succour
were
still
worse
to
them
he
seemed
no
philanthropist
but
only
a
servant
of
the
devil
an
agent
of
the
wicked
government
which
had
sent
its
ferocious
soldiers
and
slaughtered
the
parents
of
these
poor
children
a
protestant
who
came
to
complete
the
work
by
destroying
their
souls
pestalozzi
who
was
making
heroic
efforts
in
their
behalf
seems
to
have
wondered
at
the
animosity
shown
him
by
the
people
of
stanz
but
on
looking
back
we
must
admit
that
in
the
circumstances
it
was
only
natural
and
yet
in
spite
of
enormous
difficulties
of
every
kind
pestalozzi
triumphed
within
the
five
months
he
spent
with
them
he
attached
to
him
the
hearts
of
the
children
and
produced
in
them
a
marvellous
physical
intellectual
and
moral
change
ever
there
was
a
miracle
says
michelet
was
here
it
was
the
reward
of
a
strong
faith
of
a
wonderful
expansion
of
heart
he
believed
he
willed
he
what
was
the
great
act
of
faith
by
which
pestalozzi
triumphed
according
to
michelet
he
stood
before
these
vicious
and
degraded
children
and
said
is
pestalozzi
does
not
tell
us
this
himself
and
as
a
benighted
believer
in
christianity
i
venture
to
differ
from
the
enlightened
michelet
as
far
as
i
can
judge
from
own
teaching
the
source
of
his
strength
was
his
belief
in
the
goodness
not
of
man
but
of
god
but
encouraged
and
rewarded
as
he
was
by
the
result
pestalozzi
could
not
long
have
maintained
this
fearful
exertion
he
was
over
fifty
years
of
age
and
he
must
soon
have
succumbed
indeed
he
was
already
spitting
blood
when
in
june
the
french
soldiers
whose
action
had
brought
him
to
stanz
drove
him
away
again
falling
back
before
the
austrians
they
had
need
of
a
hospital
in
stanz
and
demanded
the
buildings
occupied
by
pestalozzi
and
the
children
so
almost
all
the
children
had
to
be
sent
away
and
then
at
last
pestalozzi
took
thought
for
his
own
health
and
retired
to
some
baths
in
the
mountains
but
most
of
his
peculiarities
in
teaching
may
be
said
to
date
from
the
experience
at
stanz
and
i
will
therefore
give
this
experience
in
his
own
words
the
following
is
the
account
given
in
his
letter
to
his
friend
gessner
i
have
in
part
availed
myself
of
translation
of
guimps
pp
friend
once
more
i
awake
from
a
dream
once
more
i
see
my
work
destroyed
and
my
failing
strength
wasted
however
weak
and
unfortunate
my
attempt
a
friend
of
humanity
will
not
grudge
a
few
moments
to
consider
the
reasons
which
convince
me
that
some
day
a
more
fortunate
posterity
will
certainly
take
up
the
thread
of
my
hopes
at
the
place
where
it
is
now
broken
once
more
made
known
as
well
as
i
could
my
old
wishes
for
the
education
of
the
people
in
particular
i
laid
my
whole
scheme
before
legrand
then
one
of
the
directors
who
not
only
took
a
warm
interest
in
it
but
agreed
with
me
that
the
republic
stood
in
urgent
need
of
a
reform
of
public
education
he
also
agreed
with
me
that
much
might
be
done
for
the
regeneration
of
the
people
by
giving
a
certain
number
of
the
poorest
children
an
education
which
should
be
complete
but
which
far
from
lifting
them
out
of
their
proper
sphere
would
but
attach
them
the
more
strongly
to
it
limited
my
desires
to
this
one
point
legrand
helping
me
in
every
possible
way
he
even
thought
my
views
so
important
that
he
once
said
to
me
shall
not
willingly
give
up
my
present
post
till
you
have
begun
your
was
my
intention
to
try
to
find
near
zurich
or
in
aargau
a
place
where
i
should
be
able
to
join
industry
and
agriculture
to
the
other
means
of
instruction
and
so
give
my
establishment
all
the
development
necessary
to
its
complete
success
but
the
unterwalden
disaster
september
left
me
no
further
choice
in
the
matter
the
government
felt
the
urgent
need
of
sending
help
to
this
unfortunate
district
and
begged
me
for
this
once
to
make
an
attempt
to
put
my
plans
into
execution
in
a
place
where
almost
everything
that
could
have
made
it
a
success
was
wanting
went
there
gladly
i
felt
that
the
innocence
of
the
people
would
make
up
for
what
was
wanting
and
that
their
distress
would
at
any
rate
make
them
grateful
eagerness
to
realise
at
last
the
great
dream
of
my
life
would
have
led
me
to
work
on
the
very
highest
peaks
of
the
alps
and
so
to
speak
without
fire
or
water
a
house
the
government
made
over
to
me
the
new
part
of
the
ursuline
convent
at
stanz
but
when
i
arrived
it
was
still
uncompleted
and
not
in
any
way
fitted
to
receive
a
large
number
of
children
before
anything
else
could
be
done
then
the
house
itself
had
to
be
got
ready
the
government
gave
the
necessary
orders
and
rengger
pushed
on
the
work
with
much
zeal
and
useful
activity
i
was
never
indeed
allowed
to
want
for
money
spite
however
of
the
admirable
support
i
received
all
this
preparation
took
time
and
time
was
precisely
what
we
could
least
afford
since
it
was
of
the
highest
importance
that
a
number
of
children
whom
the
war
had
left
homeless
and
destitute
should
be
received
at
once
was
still
without
everything
but
money
when
the
children
crowded
in
neither
kitchen
rooms
nor
beds
were
ready
to
receive
them
at
first
this
was
a
source
of
inconceivable
confusion
for
the
first
few
weeks
i
was
shut
up
in
a
very
small
room
the
weather
was
bad
and
the
alterations
which
made
a
great
dust
and
filled
the
corridors
with
rubbish
rendered
the
air
very
unhealthy
want
of
beds
compelled
me
at
first
to
send
some
of
the
poor
children
home
at
night
these
children
generally
came
back
the
next
day
covered
with
vermin
most
of
them
on
their
arrival
were
very
degenerated
specimens
of
humanity
many
of
them
had
a
sort
of
chronic
which
almost
prevented
their
walking
or
sores
on
their
heads
or
rags
full
of
vermin
many
were
almost
skeletons
with
haggard
careworn
faces
and
shrinking
looks
some
brazen
accustomed
to
begging
hypocrisy
and
all
sorts
of
deceit
others
broken
by
misfortune
patient
suspicious
timid
and
entirely
devoid
of
affection
there
were
also
some
spoilt
children
amongst
them
who
had
known
the
sweets
of
comfort
and
were
therefore
full
of
pretensions
these
kept
to
themselves
affected
to
despise
the
little
beggars
their
comrades
and
to
suffer
from
this
equality
and
seemed
to
find
it
impossible
to
adapt
themselves
to
the
ways
of
the
house
which
differed
too
much
from
their
old
habits
but
what
was
common
to
them
all
was
a
persistent
idleness
resulting
from
their
want
of
physical
and
mental
activity
out
of
every
ten
children
there
was
hardly
one
who
knew
his
a
b
c
as
for
any
other
knowledge
it
was
of
course
out
of
the
question
entire
absence
of
school
learning
was
what
troubled
me
least
for
i
trusted
in
the
natural
powers
that
god
bestows
on
even
the
poorest
and
most
neglected
children
i
had
observed
for
a
long
time
that
behind
their
coarseness
shyness
and
apparent
incapacity
are
hidden
the
finest
faculties
the
most
precious
powers
and
now
even
amongst
these
poor
creatures
by
whom
i
was
surrounded
at
stanz
marked
natural
abilities
soon
began
to
show
themselves
i
knew
how
useful
the
common
needs
of
life
are
in
teaching
men
the
relations
of
things
in
bringing
out
their
natural
intelligence
in
forming
their
judgment
and
in
arousing
faculties
which
buried
as
it
were
beneath
the
coarser
elements
of
their
nature
can
not
become
active
and
useful
till
they
are
set
free
it
was
my
object
then
to
set
free
these
faculties
and
bring
them
to
bear
on
the
pure
and
simple
circumstances
of
domestic
life
for
i
was
convinced
this
was
all
that
was
wanting
and
these
natural
faculties
would
shew
themselves
capable
of
raising
the
hearts
and
minds
of
my
pupils
to
all
that
i
could
desire
saw
then
how
my
wishes
might
be
carried
out
and
i
was
persuaded
that
my
affection
would
change
the
state
of
my
children
just
as
quickly
as
the
spring
sun
would
awake
to
new
life
the
earth
that
winter
had
benumbed
i
was
not
deceiving
myself
before
the
spring
sun
melted
the
snow
of
our
mountains
my
children
were
hardly
to
be
recognised
i
must
not
anticipate
just
as
in
the
evening
i
often
mark
the
quick
growth
of
the
gourd
by
the
side
of
the
house
so
i
want
you
to
mark
the
growth
of
my
plant
and
my
friend
i
will
not
hide
from
you
the
worm
which
sometimes
fastens
on
the
leaves
sometimes
even
on
the
heart
opened
the
establishment
with
no
other
helper
but
a
i
had
not
only
to
teach
the
children
but
to
look
after
their
physical
needs
i
preferred
being
alone
and
unfortunately
it
was
the
only
way
to
reach
my
end
no
one
in
the
world
would
have
cared
to
enter
into
my
views
for
the
education
of
children
and
at
that
time
i
knew
scarcely
any
one
even
capable
of
it
proportion
as
the
men
whom
i
might
have
called
to
my
aid
were
highly
educated
just
so
far
they
failed
to
understand
me
and
were
incapable
of
confining
themselves
even
in
theory
to
the
simple
which
i
sought
to
come
back
to
all
their
views
about
the
organisation
and
requirements
of
the
enterprise
differed
entirely
from
mine
what
they
specially
objected
to
was
the
notion
that
the
enterprise
might
be
carried
out
without
the
aid
of
any
artificial
means
and
simply
by
the
influence
of
nature
in
the
environment
of
the
children
and
by
the
activity
aroused
in
them
by
the
needs
of
their
daily
life
yet
it
was
precisely
upon
this
idea
that
i
based
all
my
hope
of
success
it
was
as
it
were
a
basis
for
innumerable
other
points
of
view
teachers
then
could
not
help
me
still
less
boorish
ignorant
men
i
had
nothing
to
put
into
the
hands
of
assistants
to
guide
them
nor
any
results
or
apparatus
by
which
i
could
make
my
ideas
clearer
to
them
thus
whether
i
would
or
no
i
had
first
to
make
my
experiment
alone
and
collect
facts
to
illustrate
the
essential
features
of
my
system
before
i
could
venture
to
look
for
outside
help
indeed
in
my
then
position
nobody
could
help
me
i
knew
that
i
must
help
myself
and
shaped
my
plans
accordingly
wanted
to
prove
by
my
experiment
that
if
public
education
is
to
have
any
real
value
for
humanity
it
must
imitate
the
means
which
make
the
merit
of
domestic
education
for
it
is
my
opinion
that
if
school
teaching
does
not
take
into
consideration
the
circumstances
of
family
life
and
everything
else
that
bears
on
a
general
education
it
can
only
lead
to
an
artificial
and
methodical
dwarfing
of
humanity
any
good
education
the
mother
must
be
able
to
judge
daily
nay
hourly
from
the
eyes
lips
and
face
of
the
slightest
change
in
his
soul
the
power
of
the
educator
too
must
be
that
of
a
father
quickened
by
the
general
circumstances
of
domestic
life
was
the
foundation
upon
which
i
built
i
determined
that
there
should
not
be
a
minute
in
the
day
when
my
children
should
not
be
aware
from
my
face
and
my
lips
that
my
heart
was
theirs
that
their
happiness
was
my
happiness
and
their
pleasures
my
pleasures
readily
accepts
what
is
good
and
the
child
readily
listens
to
it
but
it
is
not
for
you
that
he
wants
it
master
and
educator
but
for
himself
the
good
to
which
you
would
lead
him
must
not
depend
on
your
capricious
humour
or
passion
it
must
be
a
good
which
is
good
in
itself
and
by
the
nature
of
things
and
which
the
child
can
recognize
as
good
he
must
feel
the
necessity
of
your
will
in
things
which
concern
his
comfort
before
he
can
be
expected
to
obey
it
he
does
gladly
whatever
gains
him
credit
whatever
tends
to
accomplish
his
great
hopes
whatever
awakens
his
powers
and
enables
him
truly
to
say
all
this
he
this
will
is
not
aroused
by
words
it
is
aroused
only
by
a
kind
of
complete
culture
which
gives
feelings
and
powers
words
do
not
give
the
thing
itself
but
only
an
expression
a
clear
picture
of
the
thing
which
we
already
have
in
our
minds
all
things
i
was
bound
to
gain
the
confidence
and
the
love
of
the
children
i
was
sure
that
if
i
succeeded
in
this
all
the
rest
would
come
of
itself
friend
only
think
how
i
was
placed
and
how
great
were
the
prejudices
of
the
people
and
of
the
children
themselves
and
you
will
comprehend
what
difficulties
i
had
to
after
narrating
what
we
already
know
he
goes
on
my
friend
of
this
temper
of
the
people
of
my
weakness
of
my
poor
appearance
of
the
to
which
i
was
almost
publicly
exposed
and
then
judge
how
much
i
had
to
endure
for
the
sake
of
carrying
on
my
work
yet
however
painful
this
want
of
help
and
support
was
to
me
it
was
favourable
to
the
success
of
my
undertaking
for
it
compelled
me
to
be
always
everything
for
my
children
i
was
alone
with
them
from
morning
till
night
it
was
from
me
that
they
received
all
that
could
do
them
good
soul
and
body
all
needful
help
consolation
and
instruction
they
received
direct
from
me
their
hands
were
in
mine
my
eyes
were
fixed
on
theirs
wept
and
smiled
together
they
forgot
the
world
and
stanz
they
only
knew
that
they
were
with
me
and
i
with
them
we
shared
our
food
and
drink
i
had
about
me
neither
family
friends
nor
servants
nothing
but
them
i
was
with
them
in
sickness
and
in
health
and
when
they
slept
i
was
the
last
to
go
to
bed
and
the
first
to
get
up
in
the
bedroom
i
prayed
with
them
and
at
their
own
request
taught
them
till
they
fell
asleep
their
clothes
and
bodies
were
intolerably
filthy
but
i
looked
after
both
myself
and
was
thus
constantly
exposed
to
the
risk
of
contagion
is
how
it
was
that
these
children
gradually
became
so
attached
to
me
some
indeed
so
deeply
that
they
contradicted
their
parents
and
friends
when
they
heard
evil
things
said
about
me
they
felt
that
i
was
being
treated
unfairly
and
loved
me
i
think
the
more
for
it
but
of
what
avail
is
it
for
the
young
nestlings
to
love
their
mother
when
the
bird
of
prey
that
is
bent
on
destroying
them
is
constantly
hovering
near
the
first
results
of
these
principles
and
of
this
line
of
action
were
not
always
satisfactory
nor
indeed
could
they
be
so
the
children
did
not
always
understand
my
love
accustomed
to
idleness
unbounded
liberty
and
the
fortuitous
and
lawless
pleasures
of
an
almost
wild
life
they
had
come
to
the
convent
in
the
expectation
of
being
well
fed
and
of
having
nothing
to
do
some
of
them
soon
discovered
that
they
had
been
there
long
enough
and
wanted
to
go
away
again
they
talked
of
the
school
fever
that
attacks
children
when
they
are
kept
employed
all
day
long
this
dissatisfaction
which
showed
itself
during
the
first
months
resulted
principally
from
the
fact
that
many
of
them
were
ill
the
consequence
either
of
the
sudden
change
of
diet
and
habits
or
of
the
severity
of
the
weather
and
the
dampness
of
the
building
in
which
we
lived
we
all
coughed
a
great
deal
and
several
children
were
seized
with
a
peculiar
sort
of
fever
this
fever
which
always
began
with
sickness
was
very
general
in
the
district
cases
of
sickness
however
not
followed
by
fever
were
not
at
all
rare
and
were
an
almost
natural
consequence
of
the
change
of
food
many
people
attributed
the
fever
to
bad
food
but
the
facts
soon
showed
them
to
be
wrong
for
not
a
single
child
succumbed
the
return
of
spring
it
was
evident
to
everybody
that
the
children
were
all
doing
well
growing
rapidly
and
gaining
colour
certain
magistrates
and
ecclesiastics
who
saw
them
some
time
afterwards
stated
that
they
had
improved
almost
beyond
recognition
passed
before
i
had
the
satisfaction
of
having
my
hand
grasped
by
a
single
grateful
parent
but
the
children
were
won
over
much
sooner
they
even
wept
sometimes
when
their
parents
met
me
or
left
me
without
a
word
of
salutation
many
of
them
were
perfectly
happy
and
used
to
say
to
their
mothers
am
better
here
than
at
at
home
indeed
as
they
readily
told
me
when
we
talked
alone
they
had
been
and
beaten
and
had
often
had
neither
bread
to
eat
nor
bed
to
lie
down
upon
and
yet
these
same
children
would
sometimes
go
off
with
their
mothers
the
very
next
morning
good
many
others
however
soon
saw
that
by
staying
with
me
they
might
both
learn
something
and
become
something
and
these
never
failed
in
their
zeal
and
attachment
before
very
long
their
conduct
was
imitated
by
others
who
had
not
altogether
the
same
feelings
who
ran
away
were
the
worst
in
character
and
the
least
capable
but
they
were
not
incited
to
go
till
they
were
free
of
their
vermin
and
their
rags
several
were
sent
to
me
with
no
other
purpose
than
that
of
being
taken
away
again
as
soon
as
they
were
clean
and
well
clothed
after
a
time
their
better
judgment
overcame
the
defiant
hostility
with
which
they
arrived
in
i
had
nearly
eighty
children
most
of
them
were
bright
and
intelligent
some
even
remarkably
so
most
of
them
study
was
something
entirely
new
as
soon
as
they
found
that
they
could
learn
their
zeal
was
indefatigable
and
in
a
few
weeks
children
who
had
never
before
opened
a
book
and
could
hardly
repeat
a
or
an
would
study
the
whole
day
long
with
the
keenest
interest
even
after
supper
when
i
used
to
say
to
them
will
you
go
to
bed
or
learn
something
they
would
generally
answer
especially
in
the
first
month
or
two
it
is
true
that
afterwards
when
they
had
to
get
up
very
early
it
was
not
quite
the
same
this
first
eagerness
did
much
towards
starting
the
establishment
on
the
right
lines
and
making
the
studies
the
success
they
ultimately
were
a
success
indeed
which
far
surpassed
my
expectations
and
yet
great
beyond
expression
were
my
difficulties
i
did
not
as
yet
find
it
possible
to
organise
the
studies
properly
my
trust
nor
my
zeal
had
been
able
to
overcome
either
the
intractability
of
individuals
or
the
want
of
coherence
in
the
whole
experiment
the
general
order
of
the
establishment
i
felt
must
be
based
upon
order
of
a
higher
character
as
this
higher
order
did
not
yet
exist
i
had
to
attempt
to
create
it
for
without
this
foundation
i
could
not
hope
to
organise
properly
either
the
teaching
or
the
general
management
of
the
place
nor
should
i
have
wished
to
do
so
i
wanted
everything
to
result
not
from
a
preconceived
plan
but
from
my
relations
with
the
children
the
high
principles
and
educating
forces
i
was
seeking
i
looked
for
from
the
harmonious
common
life
of
my
children
from
their
common
attention
activity
and
needs
it
was
not
then
from
any
external
organisation
that
i
looked
for
the
regeneration
of
which
they
stood
so
much
in
need
if
i
had
employed
constraint
regulations
and
lectures
i
should
instead
of
winning
and
ennobling
my
hearts
have
repelled
them
and
made
them
bitter
and
thus
been
farther
than
ever
from
my
aim
first
of
all
i
had
to
arouse
in
them
pure
moral
and
noble
feelings
so
that
afterwards
in
external
things
i
might
be
sure
of
their
ready
attention
activity
and
obedience
i
had
in
short
to
follow
the
high
precept
of
jesus
christ
first
that
which
is
within
that
the
outside
may
be
clean
also
and
if
ever
the
truth
of
this
precept
was
made
manifest
it
was
made
manifest
then
one
aim
was
to
make
their
new
life
in
common
and
their
new
powers
awaken
a
feeling
of
brotherhood
amongst
the
children
and
make
them
affectionate
just
and
considerate
was
successful
in
gaining
my
aims
amongst
these
seventy
wild
there
soon
existed
such
peace
friendship
and
cordial
relations
as
are
rare
even
between
actual
brothers
and
sisters
principle
to
which
i
endeavoured
to
conform
all
my
conduct
was
as
follows
endeavour
first
to
broaden
your
sympathies
and
by
satisfying
their
daily
needs
to
bring
love
and
kindness
into
such
unceasing
contact
with
their
impressions
and
their
activity
that
these
sentiments
may
be
engrafted
in
their
hearts
then
try
to
give
them
such
judgment
and
tact
as
will
enable
them
to
make
a
wise
sure
and
abundant
use
of
these
virtues
in
the
circle
which
surrounds
them
in
the
last
place
do
not
hesitate
to
touch
on
the
difficult
questions
of
good
and
evil
and
the
words
connected
with
them
and
you
must
do
this
especially
in
connection
with
the
ordinary
events
of
every
day
upon
which
your
whole
teaching
in
these
matters
must
be
founded
so
that
the
children
may
be
reminded
of
their
own
feelings
and
supplied
as
it
were
with
solid
facts
upon
which
to
base
their
conception
of
the
beauty
and
justice
of
the
moral
life
even
though
you
should
have
to
spend
whole
nights
in
trying
to
express
in
two
words
what
others
say
in
twenty
never
regret
the
loss
of
sleep
gave
my
children
very
few
explanations
i
taught
them
neither
morality
nor
religion
but
sometimes
when
they
were
perfectly
quiet
i
used
to
say
to
them
you
not
think
that
you
are
better
and
more
reasonable
when
you
are
like
this
than
when
you
are
making
a
noise
when
they
clung
round
my
neck
and
called
me
their
father
i
used
to
say
children
would
it
be
right
to
deceive
your
father
after
kissing
me
like
this
would
you
like
to
do
anything
behind
my
back
to
vex
me
when
our
talk
turned
on
the
misery
of
the
country
and
they
were
feeling
glad
at
the
thought
of
their
own
happier
lot
i
would
say
good
god
is
to
have
given
man
a
compassionate
heart
they
perfectly
understood
that
all
they
did
was
but
a
preparation
for
their
future
activity
and
they
looked
forward
to
happiness
as
the
certain
result
of
their
perseverance
that
is
why
steady
application
soon
became
easy
to
them
its
object
being
in
perfect
accordance
with
their
wishes
and
their
hopes
virtue
my
friend
is
developed
by
this
agreement
just
as
the
young
plant
thrives
when
the
soil
suits
its
nature
and
supplies
the
needs
of
its
tender
shoots
witnessed
the
growth
of
an
inward
strength
in
my
children
which
in
its
general
development
far
surpassed
my
expectations
and
in
its
particular
manifestations
not
only
often
surprised
me
but
touched
me
deeply
the
neighbouring
town
of
altdorf
was
burnt
down
i
gathered
the
children
round
me
and
said
has
been
burnt
down
perhaps
at
this
very
moment
there
are
a
hundred
children
there
without
home
food
or
clothes
will
you
not
ask
our
good
government
to
let
twenty
of
them
come
and
live
with
us
i
still
seem
to
see
the
emotion
with
which
they
answered
yes
yes
my
children
i
said
well
of
what
you
are
asking
even
now
we
have
scarcely
money
enough
and
it
is
not
at
all
certain
that
if
these
poor
children
came
to
us
the
government
would
give
us
any
more
than
they
do
at
present
so
that
you
might
have
to
work
harder
and
share
your
clothes
with
these
children
and
sometimes
perhaps
go
without
food
do
not
say
then
that
you
would
like
them
to
come
unless
you
are
quite
prepared
for
all
these
after
having
spoken
to
them
in
this
way
as
seriously
as
i
could
i
made
them
repeat
all
i
had
said
to
be
quite
sure
that
they
had
thoroughly
understood
what
the
consequences
of
their
request
would
be
but
they
were
not
in
the
least
shaken
in
their
decision
and
all
repeated
yes
we
are
quite
ready
to
work
harder
eat
less
and
share
our
clothes
for
we
want
them
to
refugees
from
the
grisons
having
given
me
a
few
crowns
for
my
poor
children
i
at
once
called
them
and
said
men
are
obliged
to
leave
their
country
they
hardly
know
where
they
will
find
a
home
yet
in
spite
of
their
trouble
they
have
given
me
this
for
you
come
and
thank
and
the
emotion
of
the
children
brought
tears
to
the
eyes
of
the
refugees
was
in
this
way
that
i
strove
to
awaken
the
feeling
of
each
virtue
before
talking
about
it
for
i
thought
it
unwise
to
talk
to
children
on
subjects
which
would
compel
them
to
speak
without
thoroughly
understanding
what
they
were
saying
followed
up
this
awakening
of
the
sentiments
by
exercises
intended
to
teach
the
children
so
that
all
that
was
good
in
them
might
be
applied
to
the
practical
questions
of
life
will
easily
be
understood
that
in
this
respect
it
was
not
possible
to
organise
any
system
of
discipline
for
the
establishment
that
could
only
come
slowly
as
the
general
work
developed
as
an
aid
to
application
is
perhaps
the
great
secret
of
such
an
institution
i
found
it
very
useful
to
insist
on
silence
when
i
was
teaching
and
also
to
pay
particular
attention
to
the
attitude
of
my
children
i
succeeded
so
well
that
the
moment
i
asked
for
silence
i
could
teach
in
quite
a
low
voice
the
children
repeated
my
words
all
together
and
as
there
was
no
other
sound
i
was
able
to
detect
the
slightest
mistakes
of
pronunciation
it
is
true
that
this
was
not
always
so
sometimes
whilst
they
repeated
sentences
after
me
i
would
ask
them
as
if
in
fun
to
keep
their
eyes
fixed
on
their
middle
fingers
it
is
hardly
credible
how
useful
simple
things
of
this
sort
sometimes
are
as
means
to
the
very
highest
ends
young
girl
for
instance
who
had
been
little
better
than
a
savage
by
keeping
her
head
and
body
upright
and
not
looking
about
made
more
progress
in
her
moral
education
than
any
one
would
have
believed
possible
experiences
have
shown
me
that
the
mere
habit
of
carrying
oneself
well
does
much
more
for
the
education
of
the
moral
sentiments
than
any
amount
of
teaching
and
lectures
in
which
this
simple
fact
is
ignored
to
the
application
of
these
principles
my
children
soon
became
more
open
more
contented
and
more
susceptible
to
every
good
and
noble
influence
than
any
one
could
possibly
have
foreseen
when
they
first
came
to
me
so
utterly
devoid
were
they
of
ideas
good
feelings
and
moral
principles
as
a
matter
of
fact
this
lack
of
previous
instruction
was
not
a
serious
obstacle
to
me
indeed
it
hardly
troubled
me
at
all
i
am
inclined
even
to
say
that
in
the
simple
method
i
was
following
it
was
often
an
advantage
for
i
had
incomparably
less
trouble
to
develop
those
children
whose
minds
were
still
blank
than
those
who
had
already
acquired
inaccurate
ideas
the
former
too
were
much
more
open
than
the
latter
to
the
influence
of
all
pure
and
simple
sentiments
when
the
children
were
obdurate
and
churlish
then
i
was
severe
and
made
use
of
corporal
punishment
dear
friend
the
pedagogical
principle
which
says
that
we
must
win
the
hearts
and
minds
of
our
children
by
words
alone
without
having
recourse
to
corporal
punishment
is
certainly
good
and
applicable
under
favourable
conditions
and
circumstances
but
with
children
of
such
widely
different
ages
as
mine
children
for
the
most
part
beggars
and
all
full
of
faults
a
certain
amount
of
corporal
punishment
was
inevitable
especially
as
i
was
anxious
to
arrive
surely
speedily
and
by
the
simplest
means
at
gaining
an
influence
over
them
all
for
the
sake
of
putting
them
all
in
the
right
road
i
was
compelled
to
punish
them
but
it
would
be
a
mistake
to
suppose
that
i
thereby
in
any
way
lost
the
confidence
of
my
pupils
is
not
the
rare
and
isolated
actions
that
form
the
opinions
and
feelings
of
children
but
the
impressions
of
every
day
and
every
hour
from
such
impressions
they
judge
whether
we
are
kindly
disposed
towards
them
or
not
and
this
settles
their
general
attitude
towards
us
their
judgment
of
isolated
actions
depends
upon
this
general
attitude
is
how
it
is
that
punishments
inflicted
by
parents
rarely
make
a
bad
impression
but
it
is
quite
different
with
schoolmasters
and
teachers
who
are
not
with
their
children
night
and
day
and
have
none
of
those
relations
with
them
which
result
from
life
in
common
punishments
never
produced
obstinacy
the
children
i
had
beaten
were
quite
satisfied
if
a
moment
afterwards
i
gave
them
my
hand
and
kissed
them
and
i
could
read
in
their
eyes
that
the
final
effect
of
my
blows
was
really
joy
the
following
is
a
striking
instance
of
the
effect
this
sort
of
punishment
sometimes
had
one
day
one
of
the
children
i
liked
best
taking
advantage
of
my
affection
unjustly
threatened
one
of
his
companions
i
was
very
indignant
and
my
hand
did
not
spare
him
he
seemed
at
first
almost
and
cried
bitterly
for
at
least
a
quarter
of
an
hour
when
i
had
gone
out
however
he
got
up
and
going
to
the
boy
he
had
begged
his
pardon
and
thanked
him
for
having
spoken
about
his
bad
conduct
my
friend
this
was
no
comedy
the
child
had
never
seen
anything
like
it
before
was
impossible
that
this
sort
of
treatment
should
produce
a
bad
impression
on
my
children
because
all
day
long
i
was
giving
them
proofs
of
my
affection
and
devotion
they
could
not
misread
my
heart
and
so
they
did
not
misjudge
my
actions
it
was
not
the
same
with
the
parents
friends
strangers
and
teachers
who
visited
us
but
that
was
natural
but
i
cared
nothing
for
the
opinion
of
the
whole
world
provided
my
children
understood
me
always
did
my
best
therefore
to
make
them
clearly
understand
the
motives
of
my
actions
in
all
matters
likely
to
excite
their
attention
and
interest
this
my
friend
brings
me
to
the
consideration
of
the
moral
means
to
be
employed
in
a
truly
domestic
education
moral
education
considered
as
a
whole
includes
three
distinct
parts
the
moral
sense
must
first
be
aroused
by
their
feelings
being
made
active
and
pure
then
they
must
be
exercised
in
so
that
they
may
give
themselves
to
that
which
is
right
and
good
finally
they
must
be
brought
to
form
for
themselves
by
reflection
and
comparison
a
just
notion
of
the
moral
rights
and
duties
which
are
theirs
by
reason
of
their
position
and
surroundings
far
i
have
pointed
out
some
of
the
means
i
employed
to
reach
the
first
two
of
these
ends
they
were
just
as
simple
for
the
third
for
i
still
made
use
of
the
impressions
and
experiences
of
their
daily
life
to
give
my
children
a
true
and
exact
idea
of
right
and
duty
when
for
instance
they
made
a
noise
i
appealed
to
their
own
judgment
and
asked
them
if
it
was
possible
to
learn
under
such
conditions
i
shall
never
forget
how
strong
and
true
i
generally
found
their
sense
of
justice
and
reason
and
how
this
sense
increased
and
as
it
were
established
their
good
will
appealed
to
them
in
all
matters
that
concerned
the
establishment
it
was
generally
in
the
quiet
evening
hours
that
i
appealed
to
their
free
judgment
when
for
instance
it
was
reported
in
the
village
that
they
had
not
enough
to
eat
i
said
to
them
me
my
children
if
you
are
not
better
fed
than
you
were
at
home
think
and
tell
me
yourselves
whether
it
would
be
well
to
keep
you
here
in
such
a
way
as
would
make
it
impossible
for
you
afterwards
in
spite
of
all
your
application
and
hard
work
to
procure
what
you
had
become
accustomed
to
do
you
lack
anything
that
is
really
necessary
do
you
think
that
i
could
reasonably
and
justly
do
more
for
you
would
you
have
me
spend
all
the
money
that
is
entrusted
to
me
on
thirty
or
forty
children
instead
of
on
eighty
as
at
present
would
that
be
just
the
same
way
when
i
heard
that
it
was
reported
that
i
punished
them
too
severely
i
said
to
them
know
how
i
love
you
my
children
but
tell
me
would
you
like
me
to
stop
punishing
you
do
you
think
that
in
any
other
way
i
can
free
you
from
your
bad
habits
or
make
you
always
mind
what
i
say
you
were
there
my
friend
and
saw
with
your
own
eyes
the
sincere
emotion
with
which
they
answered
complain
about
your
hitting
us
we
wish
we
never
deserved
it
but
we
want
to
be
punished
when
we
do
things
that
make
no
difference
in
a
small
household
could
not
be
tolerated
where
the
numbers
were
so
great
i
tried
to
make
my
children
feel
this
always
leaving
them
to
decide
what
could
or
could
not
be
allowed
it
is
true
that
in
my
intercourse
with
them
i
never
spoke
of
liberty
or
equality
but
at
the
same
time
i
encouraged
them
as
far
as
possible
to
be
free
and
unconstrained
in
my
presence
with
the
result
that
every
day
i
marked
more
and
more
that
clear
open
look
in
their
eyes
which
in
my
experience
is
the
sign
of
a
really
liberal
education
i
could
not
bear
the
thought
of
betraying
the
trust
in
me
which
i
saw
shining
in
their
eyes
i
strove
constantly
to
strengthen
it
and
at
the
same
time
their
free
individuality
that
nothing
might
happen
to
trouble
those
the
sight
of
which
caused
me
the
most
intense
delight
but
i
could
not
endure
frowns
and
anxious
looks
i
myself
smoothed
away
the
frowns
then
the
children
smiled
and
even
among
themselves
they
took
care
not
to
shew
frowning
faces
reason
of
their
great
number
i
had
occasion
nearly
every
day
to
point
out
the
difference
between
good
and
evil
justice
and
injustice
good
and
evil
are
equally
contagious
amongst
so
many
children
so
that
according
as
the
good
or
bad
sentiments
spread
the
establishment
was
likely
to
become
either
much
better
or
much
worse
than
if
it
had
only
contained
a
smaller
number
about
this
too
i
talked
to
them
frankly
i
shall
never
forget
the
impression
that
my
words
produced
when
in
speaking
of
a
certain
disturbance
that
had
taken
place
among
them
i
said
children
it
is
the
same
with
us
as
with
every
other
household
when
the
children
are
numerous
and
each
gives
way
to
his
bad
habits
the
disorder
becomes
such
that
the
weakest
mother
is
driven
to
take
sensible
measures
in
bringing
up
her
children
and
make
them
submit
to
what
is
just
and
right
and
that
is
what
i
must
do
now
if
you
do
not
willingly
assist
in
the
maintenance
of
order
our
establishment
can
not
go
on
you
will
fall
back
into
your
former
condition
and
your
that
you
have
been
accustomed
to
a
good
home
clean
clothes
and
regular
be
greater
than
ever
in
this
world
my
children
necessity
and
conviction
alone
can
teach
a
man
to
behave
when
both
fail
him
he
is
hateful
think
for
a
moment
what
you
would
become
if
you
were
safe
from
want
and
cared
nothing
for
right
justice
or
goodness
at
home
there
was
always
some
one
who
looked
after
you
and
poverty
itself
forced
you
to
many
a
right
action
but
with
convictions
and
reason
to
guide
you
you
will
rise
far
higher
than
by
following
necessity
often
spoke
to
them
in
this
way
without
troubling
in
the
least
whether
they
each
understood
every
word
feeling
quite
sure
that
they
all
caught
the
general
sense
of
what
i
said
are
a
few
more
thoughts
which
produced
a
great
impression
on
my
children
you
know
anything
greater
or
nobler
than
to
give
counsel
to
the
poor
and
comfort
to
the
unfortunate
but
if
you
remain
ignorant
and
incapable
you
will
be
obliged
in
spite
of
your
good
heart
to
let
things
take
their
course
whereas
if
you
acquire
knowledge
and
power
you
will
be
able
to
give
good
advice
and
save
many
a
man
from
have
generally
found
that
great
noble
and
high
thoughts
are
indispensable
for
developing
wisdom
and
firmness
of
character
an
instruction
must
be
complete
in
the
sense
that
it
must
take
account
of
all
our
aptitudes
and
all
our
circumstances
it
must
be
conducted
too
in
a
truly
psychological
spirit
that
is
to
say
simply
lovingly
energetically
and
calmly
then
by
its
very
nature
it
produces
an
enlightened
and
delicate
feeling
for
everything
true
and
good
and
brings
to
light
a
number
of
accessory
and
dependent
truths
which
are
forthwith
accepted
and
assimilated
by
the
human
soul
even
in
the
case
of
those
who
could
not
express
these
truths
in
words
believe
that
the
first
development
of
thought
in
the
child
is
very
much
disturbed
by
a
wordy
system
of
teaching
which
is
not
adapted
either
to
his
faculties
or
the
circumstances
of
his
life
according
to
my
experience
success
depends
upon
whether
what
is
taught
to
children
commends
itself
to
them
as
true
through
being
closely
connected
with
their
own
personal
observation
and
experience
knew
no
other
order
method
or
art
but
that
which
resulted
naturally
from
my
conviction
of
my
love
for
them
nor
did
i
care
to
know
any
other
i
subordinated
the
instruction
of
my
children
to
a
higher
aim
which
was
to
arouse
and
strengthen
their
best
sentiments
by
the
relations
of
life
as
they
existed
between
themselves
and
me
a
general
rule
i
attached
little
importance
to
the
study
of
words
even
when
explanations
of
the
ideas
they
represented
were
given
tried
to
connect
study
with
manual
labour
the
school
with
the
workshop
and
make
one
thing
of
them
but
i
was
the
less
able
to
do
this
as
staff
material
and
tools
were
all
wanting
a
short
time
only
before
the
close
of
the
establishment
a
few
children
had
begun
to
spin
and
i
saw
clearly
that
before
any
fusion
could
be
effected
the
two
parts
must
be
firmly
established
that
is
on
the
one
hand
and
labour
on
the
other
in
the
work
of
the
children
i
was
already
inclined
to
care
less
for
the
immediate
gain
than
for
the
physical
training
which
by
developing
their
strength
and
skill
was
bound
to
supply
them
later
with
a
means
of
livelihood
in
the
same
way
i
considered
that
what
is
generally
called
the
instruction
of
children
should
be
merely
an
exercise
of
the
faculties
and
i
felt
it
important
to
exercise
the
attention
observation
and
memory
first
so
as
to
strengthen
these
faculties
before
calling
into
play
the
art
of
judging
and
reasoning
this
in
my
opinion
was
the
best
way
to
avoid
turning
out
that
sort
of
superficial
and
presumptuous
talker
whose
false
judgments
are
often
more
fatal
to
the
happiness
and
progress
of
humanity
than
the
ignorance
of
simple
people
of
good
sense
by
these
principles
i
sought
less
at
first
to
teach
my
children
to
spell
read
and
write
than
to
make
use
of
these
exercises
for
the
purpose
of
giving
their
minds
as
full
and
as
varied
a
development
as
possible
natural
history
they
were
very
quick
in
corroborating
what
i
taught
them
by
their
own
personal
observations
on
plants
and
animals
i
am
quite
sure
that
by
continuing
in
this
way
i
should
soon
have
been
able
not
only
to
give
them
such
a
general
acquaintance
with
the
subject
as
would
have
been
useful
in
any
vocation
but
also
to
put
them
in
a
position
to
carry
on
their
education
themselves
by
means
of
their
daily
observations
and
experiences
and
i
should
have
been
able
to
do
all
this
without
going
outside
the
very
restricted
sphere
to
which
they
were
confined
by
the
actual
circumstances
of
their
lives
i
hold
it
to
be
extremely
important
that
men
should
be
encouraged
to
learn
by
themselves
and
allowed
to
develop
freely
it
is
in
this
way
alone
that
the
diversity
of
individual
talent
is
produced
and
made
evident
always
made
the
children
learn
perfectly
even
the
least
important
things
and
i
never
allowed
them
to
lose
ground
a
word
once
learnt
for
instance
was
never
to
be
forgotten
and
a
letter
once
well
written
never
to
be
written
badly
again
i
was
very
patient
with
all
who
were
weak
or
slow
but
very
severe
with
those
who
did
anything
less
well
than
they
had
done
it
before
number
and
inequality
of
my
children
rendered
my
task
easier
just
as
in
a
family
the
eldest
and
cleverest
child
readily
shows
what
he
knows
to
his
younger
brothers
and
sisters
and
feels
proud
and
happy
to
be
able
to
take
his
place
for
a
moment
so
my
children
were
delighted
when
they
knew
something
that
they
could
teach
others
a
sentiment
of
honour
awoke
in
them
and
they
learned
twice
as
well
by
making
the
younger
ones
repeat
their
words
in
this
way
i
soon
had
helpers
and
collaborators
amongst
the
children
themselves
when
i
was
teaching
them
to
spell
difficult
words
by
heart
i
used
to
allow
any
child
who
succeeded
in
saying
one
properly
to
teach
it
to
the
others
these
whom
i
had
formed
from
the
very
outset
and
who
had
followed
my
method
step
by
step
were
certainly
much
more
useful
to
me
than
any
regular
schoolmasters
could
have
been
myself
learned
with
the
children
our
whole
system
was
so
simple
and
so
natural
that
i
should
have
had
difficulty
in
finding
a
master
who
would
not
have
thought
it
undignified
to
learn
and
teach
as
i
was
doing
will
hardly
believe
that
it
was
the
capuchin
friars
and
the
nuns
of
the
convent
that
showed
the
greatest
sympathy
with
my
work
few
people
except
truttman
took
any
active
interest
in
it
those
from
whom
i
had
hoped
most
were
too
deeply
engrossed
with
their
high
political
affairs
to
think
of
our
little
institution
as
having
the
least
degree
of
importance
were
my
dreams
but
at
the
very
moment
that
i
seemed
to
be
on
the
point
of
realizing
them
i
had
to
leave
heroic
efforts
rise
above
the
measurement
of
time
as
byron
has
said
thought
is
capable
of
years
and
it
seldom
happens
that
the
nobleness
of
any
human
action
depends
on
the
time
it
lasts
five
experiment
at
stanz
proved
one
of
the
most
memorable
events
in
the
history
of
education
he
was
now
completely
satisfied
that
he
saw
his
way
to
giving
children
a
right
education
and
raising
the
beggar
out
of
the
and
seeing
the
right
course
he
was
urged
by
his
love
of
the
people
into
taking
it
but
how
was
he
to
set
to
work
his
notions
of
school
instruction
differed
entirely
from
those
of
the
teaching
profession
and
even
in
the
revolutionary
age
they
had
some
reason
for
looking
askance
at
this
revolutionist
had
everything
against
him
we
read
indistinct
speech
bad
writing
ignorance
of
drawing
scorn
of
grammatical
learning
he
had
studied
various
branches
of
natural
history
but
without
any
particular
attention
either
to
classification
or
terminology
he
was
conversant
with
the
ordinary
operations
in
arithmetic
but
he
would
have
had
difficulty
in
getting
through
a
really
long
sum
in
multiplication
or
division
and
he
probably
had
never
tried
to
work
out
a
problem
in
geometry
for
years
this
dreamer
had
read
no
books
but
instead
of
the
usual
knowledge
that
any
young
man
of
ordinary
talent
can
acquire
in
a
year
or
two
he
understood
thoroughly
what
most
masters
were
entirely
ignorant
mind
of
man
and
the
laws
of
its
development
human
affections
and
the
art
of
arousing
and
ennobling
them
he
seemed
to
have
almost
an
intuitive
insight
into
the
development
of
human
nature
and
was
never
tired
of
contemplating
monnard
in
guimps
p
this
man
wished
to
be
a
schoolmaster
but
who
would
venture
to
entrust
him
with
a
school
no
one
seemed
willing
to
do
this
and
he
would
have
been
at
a
loss
where
to
turn
had
he
not
had
influential
friends
at
burgdorf
a
town
not
far
from
bern
these
got
for
him
permission
to
teach
not
indeed
the
children
of
burgesses
but
the
children
of
of
whom
used
to
assemble
under
a
shoemaker
in
his
house
in
the
suburbs
with
this
arrangement
however
the
shoemaker
and
the
parents
of
the
children
were
by
no
means
satisfied
the
burgesses
like
the
new
method
they
said
very
reasonably
them
try
it
on
their
own
their
grumbling
was
heard
and
permission
to
teach
was
withdrawn
from
pestalozzi
the
check
however
was
only
temporary
his
friends
were
wiser
than
the
shoemaker
and
they
procured
for
him
admission
into
the
lowest
class
of
the
school
for
children
in
this
class
there
were
about
children
boys
and
girls
between
the
ages
of
and
here
he
proved
that
he
was
vastly
different
from
a
mere
dreamer
after
teaching
these
children
in
his
own
way
for
eight
months
he
received
the
first
official
recognition
of
the
merits
of
his
system
the
burgdorf
school
commission
after
the
usual
examination
wrote
a
public
letter
to
pestalozzi
in
which
they
said
surprising
progress
of
your
little
scholars
of
various
capacities
shews
plainly
that
every
one
is
good
for
something
if
the
teacher
knows
how
to
get
at
his
abilities
and
develop
them
according
to
the
laws
of
psychology
by
your
method
of
teaching
you
have
proved
how
to
lay
the
groundwork
of
instruction
in
such
a
way
that
it
may
afterwards
support
what
is
built
on
it
between
the
ages
of
and
a
period
in
which
according
to
the
system
of
torture
enforced
hitherto
children
have
learnt
to
know
their
letters
to
spell
and
read
your
scholars
have
not
only
accomplished
all
this
with
a
success
as
yet
unknown
but
the
best
of
them
have
already
distinguished
themselves
by
their
good
writing
drawing
and
calculating
in
them
all
you
have
been
able
so
to
arouse
and
excite
a
liking
for
history
natural
history
mensuration
geography
that
thus
future
teachers
must
find
their
task
a
far
easier
one
if
they
only
know
how
to
make
good
use
of
the
preparatory
stage
the
children
have
gone
through
with
morf
pt
i
in
consequence
of
this
report
pestalozzi
in
june
was
made
master
of
the
second
school
of
burgdorf
a
school
numbering
about
boys
and
girls
from
to
years
old
with
them
pestalozzi
did
not
get
on
so
well
ramsauer
a
poor
boy
of
who
afterwards
helped
pestalozzi
at
yverdun
and
became
one
of
his
best
teachers
has
left
us
his
remembrances
two
things
seemed
clear
to
the
mind
that
their
teacher
was
very
kind
but
very
unhappy
that
the
pupils
did
not
learn
anything
and
behaved
very
badly
many
schoolmasters
have
smiled
in
derision
at
this
account
of
actual
teaching
but
in
reading
it
several
things
should
be
borne
in
mind
first
ramsauer
as
a
child
would
have
a
keen
eye
and
good
memory
for
the
eccentricities
but
how
far
the
teaching
succeeded
he
could
not
judge
for
he
did
not
know
what
it
aimed
at
then
again
he
saw
that
zeal
was
for
the
whole
school
not
for
individual
scholars
but
the
child
who
knew
of
nothing
beyond
burgdorf
could
not
tell
that
pestalozzi
was
thinking
not
so
much
of
the
children
of
burgdorf
as
of
the
children
of
europe
for
it
was
pleased
to
honour
or
to
dismiss
not
contain
him
his
aims
extended
beyond
the
town
beyond
canton
bern
beyond
switzerland
even
and
he
was
consumed
with
zeal
to
bring
about
a
radical
change
in
elementary
education
throughout
europe
the
truth
which
was
burning
within
him
he
has
himself
expressed
as
follows
we
desire
to
aid
the
poor
man
the
very
lowest
among
the
people
this
can
be
done
in
one
way
only
that
is
changing
his
schools
into
true
places
of
education
in
which
the
moral
intellectual
and
physical
powers
which
god
has
put
into
our
nature
may
be
drawn
so
that
the
man
may
be
enabled
to
live
a
life
such
as
a
man
should
live
contented
in
himself
and
satisfying
other
people
thus
and
only
thus
does
the
man
whom
in
wide
world
nobody
helps
and
nobody
can
help
learn
to
help
public
common
throughout
europe
must
not
simply
be
better
horsed
but
still
more
it
must
be
round
and
be
brought
on
to
an
entirely
new
quoted
by
morf
i
p
pestalozzi
was
now
working
heart
and
soul
at
the
engineering
of
this
his
grand
successes
hitherto
had
been
gained
more
by
the
heart
than
by
the
head
but
the
school
course
must
draw
out
the
faculties
of
the
head
as
well
as
of
the
heart
pestalozzi
made
all
instruction
start
from
what
children
observed
for
themselves
laid
special
stress
he
says
just
what
usually
affected
their
senses
and
as
i
dwelt
much
on
elementary
knowledge
i
wanted
to
know
when
the
child
receives
its
first
lesson
and
i
soon
came
to
the
conviction
that
the
first
hour
of
learning
dates
from
birth
from
the
very
moment
that
the
senses
open
to
the
impressions
of
nature
nature
teaches
it
its
new
life
is
but
the
faculty
now
come
to
maturity
of
receiving
impressions
it
is
the
awakening
of
the
germs
now
perfect
which
will
go
on
using
all
their
forces
and
energies
to
secure
the
development
of
their
proper
organisation
it
is
the
awakening
of
the
animal
now
complete
which
will
and
shall
become
a
man
so
the
sole
instruction
given
to
the
human
being
consists
merely
in
the
art
of
giving
a
helping
hand
to
this
natural
tendency
towards
its
proper
development
and
this
art
consists
essentially
in
the
means
of
putting
the
impressions
in
connexion
and
harmony
with
the
precise
degree
of
development
the
child
has
reached
there
must
be
then
in
the
impressions
to
be
given
him
by
instruction
a
regular
gradation
and
the
beginning
and
the
progress
of
his
various
knowledges
must
exactly
correspond
with
the
beginning
and
increase
in
his
powers
as
they
are
developed
from
this
i
soon
saw
that
this
gradation
must
be
ascertained
for
all
the
branches
of
human
knowledge
especially
for
those
fundamental
notions
from
which
our
thinking
power
takes
its
rise
on
such
principles
and
no
others
is
it
possible
to
construct
real
school
books
and
books
about
letter
in
endeavouring
to
put
teaching
as
he
said
a
psychological
basis
pestalozzi
compared
it
to
a
mechanism
on
one
occasion
when
expounding
his
views
he
was
interrupted
by
the
exclamation
voulez
mécaniser
pestalozzi
was
weak
in
french
and
he
took
these
words
to
mean
wish
to
get
at
the
mechanism
of
he
accordingly
assented
and
was
in
his
turn
misunderstood
soon
afterwards
he
endeavoured
to
express
the
new
thing
by
a
new
word
and
said
will
den
menschlichen
unterricht
psychologisieren
i
wish
to
psychologise
instruction
and
this
he
explains
to
mean
that
he
sought
to
make
instruction
fall
in
with
the
eternal
laws
which
govern
the
development
of
the
human
intellect
morf
i
but
this
was
a
task
which
no
one
man
could
accomplish
not
even
pestalozzi
the
eternal
laws
which
govern
the
development
of
mind
have
not
been
completely
ascertained
even
after
investigations
carried
on
during
thousands
of
years
and
pestalozzi
did
not
know
what
had
been
established
by
previous
thinkers
he
made
a
gigantic
effort
to
find
both
the
laws
and
their
application
but
if
he
had
continued
to
stand
alone
he
could
have
done
but
little
happily
he
attracted
to
him
some
young
and
vigorous
assistants
who
caught
his
enthusiasm
and
worked
in
his
spirit
they
did
much
but
there
was
one
thing
the
master
could
not
genius
just
at
this
time
before
pestalozzi
found
associates
in
his
work
he
drew
up
for
a
of
friends
of
an
account
of
his
method
and
this
begins
with
the
words
i
have
already
quoted
want
to
psychologise
basing
all
instruction
on
which
is
nearly
equivalent
to
the
own
observation
he
explains
how
this
may
be
used
for
a
series
of
exercises
and
he
takes
as
the
general
elements
of
culture
the
following
language
drawing
writing
arithmetic
and
the
art
of
measuring
in
the
education
of
the
poor
he
would
lay
special
stress
on
the
importance
of
two
things
then
and
since
much
neglected
singing
and
the
sense
of
the
beautiful
the
cradle
song
should
begin
a
series
leading
up
to
hymns
of
praise
to
god
education
should
develop
in
all
a
sense
of
the
beauties
of
nature
is
full
of
lovely
sights
yet
europe
has
done
nothing
either
to
awaken
in
the
poor
a
sense
for
these
beauties
or
to
arrange
them
in
such
a
way
as
to
produce
a
series
of
impressions
capable
of
developing
this
sense
if
ever
popular
education
should
cease
to
be
the
barbarous
absurdity
it
now
is
and
put
itself
into
harmony
with
the
real
needs
of
our
nature
this
want
will
be
guimps
in
the
last
year
of
the
eighteenth
century
pestalozzi
was
toiling
away
constant
to
his
purpose
but
not
clearly
seeing
the
road
before
him
in
march
he
wrote
to
zschokke
thirty
years
my
life
has
been
a
hopeless
struggle
against
the
most
frightful
poverty
for
thirty
years
i
have
had
to
forego
many
of
the
barest
necessaries
of
life
and
have
had
to
shun
the
society
of
my
from
sheer
lack
of
decent
clothes
many
and
many
a
time
have
i
gone
without
a
dinner
and
eaten
in
bitterness
a
dry
crust
of
bread
on
the
road
at
a
time
when
even
the
poorest
were
seated
round
a
table
all
this
i
have
suffered
and
am
still
suffering
and
with
no
other
object
than
the
realization
of
my
plans
for
helping
the
guimps
it
was
clear
that
he
could
not
help
others
till
he
himself
got
help
and
he
now
did
get
just
the
help
he
wanted
an
assistant
who
though
a
schoolmaster
was
strange
to
say
perfectly
ready
to
learn
and
to
throw
himself
into
carrying
out
another
ideas
this
was
hermann
kruesi
a
man
years
old
who
from
the
age
of
had
been
master
of
the
village
school
at
gais
in
appenzell
in
consequence
of
the
war
between
the
french
and
austrians
appenzell
was
now
reduced
to
a
state
of
famine
and
bands
of
children
were
sent
off
to
other
cantons
to
escape
starvation
fischer
a
friend
of
and
himself
an
educationist
taught
by
salzmann
wrote
from
burgdorf
to
the
pastor
of
gais
offering
to
get
thirty
children
taken
in
by
the
people
of
burgdorf
and
asking
that
they
might
be
sent
with
some
one
who
would
look
after
them
in
the
and
teach
them
in
answer
to
this
invitation
kruesi
after
a
march
entered
burgdorf
with
a
troop
of
little
ones
the
children
were
drawn
up
in
an
open
place
and
benevolent
people
chose
which
they
would
adopt
kruesi
was
taken
into
the
castle
which
the
government
had
made
over
partly
to
fischer
partly
to
pestalozzi
in
it
kruesi
opened
a
fischer
soon
afterwards
died
and
pestalozzi
proposed
to
kruesi
who
had
become
entirely
converted
to
his
views
that
they
should
unite
and
together
carry
on
the
school
in
the
castle
by
a
decree
of
july
the
executive
council
granted
to
pestalozzi
the
gratuitous
use
of
as
much
of
the
castle
and
garden
as
he
needed
and
thus
was
established
celebrated
institute
at
burgdorf
very
soon
kruesi
enlisted
other
helpers
who
had
read
and
tobler
and
buss
and
this
is
his
account
of
the
party
society
thus
consisted
of
four
very
different
men
the
founder
whose
chief
reputation
was
that
of
a
dreamy
writer
incapable
in
practical
life
and
three
young
men
one
tobler
a
private
tutor
whose
youth
had
been
much
neglected
who
had
begun
to
study
late
and
whose
pedagogic
efforts
had
never
produced
the
results
his
character
and
talents
seemed
to
promise
another
buss
a
bookbinder
who
devoted
his
leisure
to
singing
and
drawing
and
a
third
kruesi
himself
a
village
schoolmaster
who
carried
out
the
duties
of
his
office
as
best
he
could
without
having
been
in
any
way
prepared
for
them
those
who
looked
on
this
group
of
men
scarce
one
of
them
with
a
home
of
his
own
naturally
formed
but
a
small
opinion
of
their
capabilities
and
yet
our
work
succeeded
and
won
the
public
confidence
beyond
the
expectations
of
those
who
knew
us
and
even
beyond
our
guimps
with
assistance
from
the
government
there
was
added
to
the
united
schools
of
pestalozzi
and
kruesi
a
training
class
for
teachers
and
elementary
teachers
were
sent
to
spend
a
month
at
burgdorf
and
learn
of
pestalozzi
as
years
afterwards
they
were
sent
to
the
same
town
to
learn
of
froebel
this
institute
opened
in
january
and
had
nearly
three
years
of
complete
success
in
it
was
carried
out
notion
that
there
should
be
gulf
between
the
home
and
the
on
one
occasion
a
parent
visiting
the
establishment
exclaimed
this
is
not
a
school
but
a
family
and
pestalozzi
declared
that
this
was
the
highest
praise
he
could
give
it
the
bond
which
united
them
all
both
teachers
and
scholars
was
love
of
want
of
space
kept
the
number
of
children
below
a
hundred
and
these
enjoyed
great
freedom
and
worked
away
without
rewards
and
almost
without
punishments
both
public
reports
and
private
speak
very
highly
of
the
results
in
june
the
president
of
the
council
of
public
education
in
bern
declares
has
discovered
the
real
and
universal
laws
of
all
elementary
a
visitor
charles
victor
von
bonstetten
writes
children
know
little
but
what
they
know
they
know
well
they
are
very
happy
and
evidently
take
great
pleasure
in
their
lessons
which
says
a
great
deal
for
the
method
as
it
will
be
long
before
there
is
another
pestalozzi
i
fear
that
the
rich
harvest
his
discovery
seems
to
promise
will
be
reserved
for
future
the
success
of
the
method
was
specially
conspicuous
in
arithmetic
a
nürnberg
merchant
who
came
prejudiced
against
pestalozzi
was
much
impressed
and
has
acknowledged
was
amazed
when
i
saw
these
children
treating
the
most
complicated
calculations
of
fractions
as
the
simplest
thing
in
the
up
to
this
point
pestalozzi
may
be
said
to
have
gained
by
the
disposition
to
or
revolutionise
everything
which
had
prevailed
in
switzerland
since
but
from
the
reaction
which
now
set
in

he
had
gained

deputies
to
paris
to
discuss
under
the
direction
of
the
first
consul
bonaparte
what
should
be
their
future
form
of
government
among
these
deputies
pestalozzi
was
elected
and
he
set
off
thinking
more
of
the
future
of
the
schools
than
of
the
future
of
the
government
at

he
asked
for

interview

his
opinion

higher
art
than
instruction
the
first
consul
said
he
could
not
be
bothered
about
questions
of
a
b
he
however
deputed
monge
to
hear
what
pestalozzi
had
to
say
but
the
mathematician
seems
to
have
agreed
with
some
english
authorities
that
was
nothing
in
on
his
return
to
switzerland
pestalozzi
was
asked
by
buss
you
see
bonaparte
replied
pestalozzi
did
not
see
bonaparte
and
bonaparte
did
not
see
his
presumption
in
thus
putting
himself
on
an
equality
with
the
great
conqueror
seems
to
have
taken
away
the
breath
of
his
contemporaries
but
whirligig
of
time
brings
in
his
revenges
and
before
the
close
of
the
century
europe
already
thinks
more
in
amount
and
immeasurably
more
in
respect
of
pestalozzi
than
of
bonaparte
as
a
result
of
the
reaction
the
government
of
united
switzerland
ceased
to
exist
and
the
cantons
were
restored
this
destroyed
hopes
of
government
support
and
even
turned
his
institute
out
of
doors
the
castle
of
burgdorf
was
at
once
demanded
for
the
prefect
of
the
district
but
pestalozzi
was
offered
an
old
convent
at
münchenbuchsee
near
bern
and
thither
he
was
forced
to
migrate
close
to
münchenbuchsee
was
hofwyl
where
was
the
agricultural
institution
of
emmanuel
fellenberg
fellenberg
and
pestalozzi
were
old
friends
and
correspondents
and
as
they
had
much
regard
for
each
other
and
fellenberg
was
as
great
in
administration
as
pestalozzi
in
ideas
there
seemed
a
chance
of
their
benefiting
by
but
this
could
not
be
the
teachers
desired
that
the
administration
should
be
put
into
the
hands
of
fellenberg
and
this
was
done
accordingly
without
my
consent
says
pestalozzi
to
my
profound
he
could
not
work
with
this
of
iron
as
he
calls
fellenberg
so
he
left
münchenbuchsee
and
accepting
one
of
several
invitations
he
settled
in
the
castle
of
yverdun
near
the
lake
of
neuchatel
within
a
twelvemonth
he
was
followed
by
his
old
assistants
who
had
found
government
by
fellenberg
less
to
their
taste
than
by
pestalozzi
thus
arose
the
most
celebrated
institute
of
which
we
read
in
the
history
of
education
for
some
years
its
success
seemed
prodigious
teachers
came
from
all
quarters
many
of
them
sent
by
the
governments
of
the
countries
to
which
they
belonged
that
they
might
get
initiated
into
the
pestalozzian
system
children
too
were
sent
from
great
distances
some
of
them
being
intrusted
to
pestalozzi
some
of
them
living
with
their
own
tutor
in
yverdun
and
only
attending
the
institute
during
the
day
the
wave
of
enthusiasm
for
the
new
ideas
seemed
to
carry
everything
before
it
but
there
is
nothing
stable
in
a
wave
and
when
the
enthusiasm
has
subsided
disappointment
follows
this
was
the
case
at
yverdun
and
pestalozzi
outlived
his
institute
but
the
principles
on
which
he
worked
and
the
spirit
in
which
he
worked
could
not
pass
away
and
at
least
in
germany
all
elementary
schoolmasters
acknowledge
how
much
they
are
indebted
to
his
teaching
of
the
state
of
things
in
the
early
days
of
the
institute
we
have
a
very
lively
account
written
for
his
own
children
by
professor
vuillemin
who
entered
it
in
as
a
child
of
eight
and
was
in
it
for
two
years
from
this
i
extract
the
following
portrait
of
pestalozzi
my
children
a
very
ugly
man
with
rough
bristling
hair
his
face
scarred
with
and
covered
with
freckles
an
untidy
beard
no
his
breeches
not
properly
buttoned
and
coming
down
to
his
stockings
which
in
their
turn
descended
on
to
his
great
thick
shoes
fancy
him
panting
and
jerking
as
he
walked
then
his
eyes
which
at
one
time
opened
wide
to
send
a
flash
of
lightning
at
another
were
half
closed
as
if
engaged
on
what
was
going
on
within
his
features
now
expressing
a
profound
sadness
and
now
again
the
most
peaceful
happiness
his
speech
either
slow
or
hurried
either
soft
and
melodious
or
bursting
forth
like
thunder
imagine
the
man
and
you
have
him
whom
we
used
to
call
our
father
pestalozzi
such
as
i
have
sketched
him
for
you
we
loved
him
we
all
loved
him
for
he
loved
us
all
we
loved
him
so
warmly
that
when
some
time
passed
without
our
seeing
him
we
were
quite
troubled
about
it
and
when
he
again
appeared
we
could
not
take
our
eyes
off
guimps
at
this
time
he
was
no
less
loved
by
his
assistants
who
put
up
with
any
quarters
that
could
be
found
for
them
and
received
no
salary
we
read
that
the
money
paid
by
the
scholars
was
kept
in
the
room
of
head
of
the
every
master
could
get
the
key
and
when
they
required
clothes
they
took
from
these
funds
just
the
sum
requisite
this
system
or
want
of
system
went
on
for
some
time
without
abuse
as
vuillemin
says
it
was
like
a
return
to
the
early
days
of
the
christian
church
we
have
seen
that
the
first
emperor
napoleon
not
be
bothered
about
questions
of
a
b
his
was
the
pride
that
goes
before
a
fall
on
the
other
hand
the
prussian
government
which
he
brought
to
the
dust
in
the
battle
of
jena
had
the
wisdom
to
perceive
that
children
will
become
men
and
that
the
nature
of
the
instruction
they
receive
will
in
a
great
measure
determine
what
kind
of
men
they
turn
out
how
was
prussia
again
to
raise
its
head
its
rulers
decided
that
it
was
by
the
education
of
the
people
have
lost
in
territory
said
the
king
power
and
our
credit
abroad
have
fallen
but
we
must
and
will
go
to
work
to
gain
in
power
and
in
credit
at
home
it
is
for
this
reason
that
i
desire
above
everything
that
the
greatest
attention
be
paid
to
the
education
of
the
guimps
about
the
same
time
the
queen
louisa
wrote
in
her
private
diary
am
reading
and
and
i
delight
in
being
transported
into
the
swiss
village
if
i
could
do
as
i
liked
i
should
take
a
carriage
and
start
for
switzerland
to
see
pestalozzi
i
should
warmly
shake
him
by
the
hand
and
my
eyes
filled
with
tears
would
speak
my
gratitude
with
what
goodness
with
what
zeal
he
labours
for
the
welfare
of
his
yes
in
the
name
of
humanity
i
thank
him
with
my
whole
so
in
the
day
of
humiliation
prussia
seriously
went
to
work
at
the
education
of
the
people
and
this
she
did
on
the
lines
pointed
out
by
pestalozzi
to
him
they
were
directed
by
their
philosopher
fichte
who
in
his
to
the
german
delivered
at
berlin
declared
that
education
was
the
only
means
of
raising
a
nation
and
that
all
sound
reform
of
public
instruction
must
be
based
on
the
principles
of
pestalozzi
to
bring
these
principles
to
bear
on
popular
education
the
prussian
government
sent
seventeen
young
men
for
a
three
course
to
institute
as
the
minister
said
in
a
letter
to
pestalozzi
will
be
prepared
not
only
in
mind
and
judgment
but
also
in
heart
for
the
noble
vocation
which
they
are
to
follow
and
will
be
filled
with
a
sense
of
the
holiness
of
their
task
and
with
new
zeal
for
the
work
to
which
you
have
devoted
your
among
the
eminent
men
who
were
drawn
to
yverdun
were
some
who
afterwards
did
great
things
in
education
as
karl
ritter
karl
von
raumer
the
historian
of
education
the
philosopher
herbart
and
a
man
who
was
destined
to
have
more
influence
than
anyone
except
perhaps
pestalozzi
mean
friedrich
froebel
testimony
is
especially
striking
have
seen
says
he
than
the
paradise
of
switzerland
for
i
have
seen
pestalozzi
and
recognised
how
great
his
heart
is
and
how
great
his
genius
never
have
i
been
so
filled
with
a
sense
of
the
sacredness
of
my
vocation
and
the
dignity
of
human
nature
as
in
the
days
i
spent
with
this
noble
man
pestalozzi
knew
less
geography
than
a
child
in
one
of
our
primary
schools
yet
it
was
from
him
that
i
gained
my
chief
knowledge
of
this
science
for
it
was
in
listening
to
him
that
i
first
conceived
the
idea
of
the
natural
method
it
was
he
who
opened
the
way
to
me
and
i
take
pleasure
in
attributing
whatever
value
my
work
may
have
entirely
to
at
this
time
we
read
glowing
accounts
of
the
healthy
and
happy
life
of
the
children
and
throughout
pestalozzi
never
lost
a
single
pupil
by
illness
with
a
body
of
very
able
assistants
instruction
was
carried
on
for
ten
hours
out
of
the
but
in
these
hours
there
was
reckoned
the
time
spent
in
drill
gymnastics
and
singing
the
monotony
of
was
also
broken
by
frequent
and
yet
the
institute
had
taken
into
it
the
seeds
of
its
own
ruin
there
were
several
causes
of
failure
though
these
were
not
visible
till
the
house
was
divided
against
itself
first
pestalozzi
based
the
morality
and
discipline
of
the
school
on
the
relations
of
family
life
he
would
be
the
of
all
the
children
at
burgdorf
this
relation
seemed
a
reality
but
it
completely
failed
at
yverdun
when
the
institute
became
from
the
number
of
the
pupils
and
their
differences
in
language
habits
and
antecedents
a
little
world
the
pupils
still
called
him
pestalozzi
but
he
could
no
longer
know
them
as
a
father
should
know
his
children
thus
the
discipline
of
affection
slowly
disappeared
and
there
was
no
school
discipline
to
take
its
place
next
we
can
see
that
even
at
burgdorf
and
still
more
at
yverdun
pestalozzi
was
attempting
to
do
impossibilities
according
to
his
system
the
faculties
of
the
child
were
to
be
developed
in
a
natural
unbroken
order
and
the
first
exercises
were
to
give
the
child
the
power
of
surmounting
later
difficulties
by
its
own
exertions
but
this
education
could
not
be
started
at
any
age
and
yet
children
of
every
age
and
every
country
were
received
into
the
institution
it
was
not
likely
that
the
fresh
comers
could
be
made
to
understand
that
they
nothing
and
must
start
over
again
on
a
totally
different
road
the
teachers
might
take
such
pupils
to
the
water
of
but
they
could
not
inspire
the
inclination
to
drink
nor
induce
the
lad
to
learn
what
he
supposed
himself
to
know
already
but
there
was
a
greater
mischief
at
work
than
either
of
these
in
his
discourse
to
the
members
of
the
institution
on
new
day
pestalozzi
surprised
them
all
by
his
gloom
he
had
had
a
coffin
brought
in
and
he
stood
beside
it
work
said
he
founded
by
love
but
love
has
disappeared
from
our
this
was
only
too
true
and
the
discord
was
more
deeply
rooted
than
at
first
appeared
among
the
brood
of
pestalozzians
there
was
a
catholic
shepherd
lad
from
tyrol
joseph
schmid
by
name
and
he
in
the
end
proved
a
veritable
cuckoo
as
he
shewed
very
marked
ability
in
mathematics
he
became
one
of
the
assistant
masters
and
a
good
deal
of
the
fame
of
the
institution
rested
on
the
performances
of
his
pupils
but
his
ideas
differed
totally
from
those
of
his
colleagues
especially
from
those
of
niederer
a
clergyman
with
a
turn
for
philosophy
who
had
become
chief
exponent
after
gloomy
speech
the
masters
with
the
exception
of
schmid
urged
pestalozzi
to
apply
for
a
government
inquiry
into
the
state
of
the
institution
this
pestalozzi
did
and
commissioners
were
appointed
among
them
an
educationist
père
girard
of
freiburg
by
whom
the
report
was
drawn
up
the
report
was
not
favourable
père
girard
was
by
no
means
inclined
to
sit
at
the
feet
of
pestalozzi
as
he
had
principles
of
his
own
pestalozzi
he
thought
laid
far
too
much
stress
on
mathematics
and
he
drew
from
him
a
statement
that
everything
taught
to
a
child
should
seem
as
certain
as
that
two
and
two
made
four
said
girard
i
had
thirty
children
i
would
not
intrust
you
with
one
of
them
you
could
not
teach
him
that
i
was
his
thus
the
report
though
very
friendly
in
tone
was
by
no
means
friendly
in
spirit
the
commissioners
simply
compared
the
performances
of
the
scholars
with
what
pupils
of
the
same
age
could
do
in
good
schools
of
the
ordinary
type
and
père
girard
stated
though
not
in
the
report
that
the
institution
was
inferior
to
the
cantonal
school
of
aargau
but
the
comparison
of
these
incommensurables
only
shews
that
girard
was
not
capable
of
understanding
what
was
going
on
at
yverdun
indeed
he
asserts
only
that
the
was
neglected
but
also
that
the
children
they
had
reached
a
high
pitch
of
excellence
in
abstract
mathematics
were
inconceivably
weak
in
all
ordinary
practical
this
is
absurd
in
pestalozzian
teaching
the
abstract
never
went
before
ordinary
practical
calculations
the
good
father
evidently
blunders
and
takes
for
abstract
and
pen
or
pencil
arithmetic
for
practical
work
reckoning
with
slate
or
paper
is
no
doubt
but
a
distinction
has
often
to
be
drawn
between
what
is
ordinary
and
what
is
practical
soon
after
this
the
disputes
between
schmid
and
his
colleagues
waxed
so
fierce
that
schmid
was
virtually
driven
away
in
he
left
yverdun
and
declared
the
institution
disgrace
to
great
was
the
disorder
into
which
the
institution
now
fell
from
having
over
it
only
a
genius
with
unrivalled
incapacity
to
the
days
which
us
of
the
early
were
no
more
and
financial
difficulties
naturally
followed
them
for
the
next
five
years
things
went
from
bad
to
worse
and
the
masters
were
then
driven
to
the
desperate
and
as
it
proved
the
fatal
step
of
inviting
the
able
and
schmid
back
again
he
came
in
he
acquired
entire
control
over
pestalozzi
and
drove
from
him
all
his
most
faithful
adherents
among
them
not
only
niederer
who
had
invited
the
return
of
his
rival
but
even
kruesi
and
the
faithful
servant
elizabeth
naef
now
kruesi
the
widow
of
brother
grandson
married
sister
and
thus
united
with
him
by
family
ties
schmid
took
entire
possession
of
the
old
man
and
kept
it
till
the
end
his
former
colleagues
seem
to
have
been
deceived
in
their
estimate
both
of
integrity
and
ability
he
completed
the
ruin
of
the
institution
and
he
was
finally
expelled
from
yverdun
by
the
magistrates
but
while
pestalozzi
seemed
falling
lower
and
lower
to
the
eyes
of
the
inhabitants
of
yverdun
and
so
had
little
honour
in
his
own
country
his
fame
was
spreading
all
over
europe
of
this
yverdun
was
to
reap
the
benefit
in
austrian
troops
marched
across
switzerland
to
invade
france
in
january
the
castle
and
other
buildings
in
yverdun
were
for
a
military
hospital
many
of
the
austrian
soldiers
being
down
with
typhus
fever
in
a
great
fright
the
municipality
sent
off
two
deputies
to
headquarters
then
at
basel
to
petition
that
this
order
might
be
withdrawn
as
the
order
threatened
the
destruction
of
his
institution
pestalozzi
went
with
them
and
it
was
entirely
to
him
they
owed
their
success
on
their
return
they
reported
that
military
hospital
would
be
established
at
yverdun
and
that
pestalozzi
had
been
received
with
most
extraordinary
on
this
occasion
pestalozzi
took
the
opportunity
of
preaching
to
the
emperor
alexander
on
the
necessity
of
establishing
good
schools
and
of
emancipating
the
serfs
the
emperor
took
the
lecture
in
good
part
and
allowed
the
philanthropist
to
drive
him
into
a
corner
and
him
in
pestalozzi
received
a
visit
from
an
englishman
or
more
accurately
bell
who
however
like
most
of
our
compatriots
could
find
nothing
in
pestalozzi
whatever
we
may
think
of
bell
as
an
educationist
he
was
certainly
a
poor
prophet
on
leaving
yverdun
he
said
another
twelve
years
mutual
instruction
will
be
adopted
by
the
whole
world
and
method
will
be
in
december
pestalozzi
was
thrown
more
completely
into
the
power
of
schmid
by
losing
the
only
companion
from
whom
nothing
but
death
could
separate
wife
at
the
funeral
pestalozzi
standing
by
the
coffin
and
as
if
heard
by
her
whose
earthly
remains
were
in
it
ran
over
the
disasters
and
trials
they
had
passed
through
together
and
the
sacrifices
she
had
made
for
him
in
those
days
of
affliction
said
he
us
strength
to
bear
our
troubles
and
recover
hope
and
taking
up
a
bible
he
went
on
is
the
source
whence
you
drew
whence
we
both
drew
courage
strength
and
the
agony
of
the
institution
as
guimps
calls
it
lasted
for
some
years
but
in
this
gloomy
period
there
are
only
two
incidents
i
will
mention
the
first
is
the
publication
of
writings
for
which
schmid
and
pestalozzi
sought
subscriptions
and
the
appeal
was
so
cordially
answered
that
pestalozzi
received
this
sum
he
wished
to
devote
to
the
carrying
out
of
a
plan
he
had
always
cherished
of
an
orphanage
at
neuhof
but
the
money
seems
to
have
melted
we
do
not
know
how
the
other
incident
is
that
of
last
success
in
spite
of
schmid
he
would
open
a
school
for
twelve
neglected
children
at
clindy
a
hamlet
near
yverdun
here
he
produced
results
like
those
which
had
crowned
his
first
efforts
at
neuhof
stanz
and
burgdorf
old
and
incapable
as
he
seemed
in
ordinary
affairs
he
as
though
by
enchantment
gained
the
attention
and
the
affection
of
the
children
and
bent
them
entirely
to
his
will
in
a
few
months
the
number
of
children
had
risen
to
thirty
and
wonderful
progress
had
been
made
clindy
at
once
became
celebrated
pestalozzi
was
induced
to
admit
some
children
whose
friends
paid
for
them
and
schmid
then
persuaded
the
old
man
to
remove
the
school
into
the
castle
in
the
institution
which
had
lasted
for
twenty
years
was
finally
closed
and
pestalozzi
went
to
spend
his
remaining
days
nearly
three
years
as
it
proved
at
neuhof
which
was
then
in
the
hands
of
his
grandson
the
year
before
his
death
he
visited
an
orphanage
conducted
on
his
principles
by
zeller
at
beuggen
near
rheinfelden
the
children
sang
a
poem
of
quoted
in
and
and
had
a
crown
of
oak
ready
to
put
on
the
old
head
but
this
he
declined
am
not
worthy
of
it
said
he
it
for
on
february
at
the
age
of
pestalozzi
fell
asleep
reform
needed
said
pestalozzi
not
that
the
should
be
better
horsed
but
that
it
should
be
turned
right
round
and
started
on
a
new
this
may
seem
a
violent
metaphor
but
perhaps
it
is
not
more
violent
than
the
change
that
was
and
in
this
country
still
is
necessary
let
us
try
to
ascertain
what
is
the
right
road
according
to
pestalozzi
and
then
see
on
what
road
the
is
now
travelling
the
grand
change
advocated
by
pestalozzi
was
a
change
of
the
main
object
of
the
school
should
not
be
to
but
to
this
change
of
object
naturally
brings
many
changes
with
it
measured
by
their
capacity
for
acquiring
school
knowledge
and
skill
young
children
may
be
considered
as
one
of
inspectors
considered
them
of
the
but
if
the
school
exists
not
to
teach
but
to
develop
young
children
instead
of
being
the
become
the
most
important
part
of
all
in
the
development
of
all
organisms
more
depends
on
the
earlier
than
on
the
later
stages
and
there
is
no
reason
to
doubt
that
this
law
holds
in
the
case
of
human
beings
on
this
account
from
the
days
of
pestalozzi
educational
science
has
been
greatly
i
may
say
mainly
concerned
with
young
children
for
the
dominating
thought
has
been
that
the
young
human
being
is
an
undeveloped
organism
and
that
in
education
that
organism
is
developed
so
the
essence
of
pestalozzianism
lies
not
so
much
in
its
method
as
in
its
aim
not
more
in
what
it
does
than
in
what
it
endeavours
to
do
and
thus
it
was
that
pestalozzi
in
words
the
scholastic
world
to
revise
the
whole
of
their
task
to
reflect
on
the
nature
and
destiny
of
man
and
also
on
the
proper
way
of
leading
him
from
his
youth
towards
that
and
it
was
his
love
of
his
that
raised
him
to
this
standpoint
he
was
moved
by
enthusiasm
of
consumed
with
grief
for
the
degradation
of
the
swiss
peasantry
he
never
lost
faith
in
their
true
dignity
as
men
and
in
the
possibility
of
raising
them
to
a
condition
worthy
of
it
he
cast
about
for
the
best
means
of
thus
raising
them
and
decided
that
it
could
be
effected
not
by
any
improvement
in
their
outward
circumstances
but
by
an
education
which
should
make
them
what
their
creator
intended
them
to
be
and
should
give
them
the
use
and
the
consciousness
of
all
their
inborn
faculties
my
youth
up
he
says
felt
what
a
high
and
indispensable
human
duty
it
is
to
labour
for
the
poor
and
miserable
that
he
may
attain
to
a
consciousness
of
his
own
dignity
through
his
feeling
of
the
universal
powers
and
endowments
which
he
possesses
awakened
within
him
that
he
may
not
only
learn
to
gabble
over
by
rote
the
religious
maxim
that
is
created
in
the
image
of
god
and
is
bound
to
live
and
die
as
a
child
of
god
but
may
himself
experience
its
truth
by
virtue
of
the
divine
power
within
him
so
that
he
may
be
raised
not
only
above
the
ploughing
oxen
but
also
above
the
man
in
purple
and
silk
who
lives
unworthily
of
his
high
quoted
in
barnard
again
he
says
and
i
quote
at
length
on
the
point
as
it
is
indeed
the
key
to
pestalozzianism
have
i
insisted
so
strongly
on
attention
to
early
physical
and
intellectual
education
because
i
consider
these
as
merely
leading
to
a
higher
aim
to
qualify
the
human
being
for
the
free
and
full
use
of
all
the
faculties
implanted
by
the
creator
and
to
direct
all
these
faculties
towards
the
perfection
of
the
whole
being
of
man
that
he
may
be
enabled
to
act
in
his
peculiar
station
as
an
instrument
of
that
and
almighty
power
that
has
called
him
into
to
greaves
believing
in
this
high
aim
of
education
pestalozzi
required
a
proper
early
training
for
all
alike
human
being
said
he
a
claim
to
a
judicious
development
of
his
faculties
by
those
to
whom
the
care
of
his
infancy
is
pestalozzi
therefore
most
earnestly
addressed
himself
to
mothers
to
convince
them
of
the
power
placed
in
their
hands
and
to
teach
them
how
to
use
it
mother
is
qualified
and
qualified
by
the
creator
himself
to
become
the
principal
agent
in
the
development
of
her
child
and
what
is
demanded
of
her
god
has
given
to
thy
child
all
the
faculties
of
our
nature
but
the
grand
point
remains
shall
this
heart
this
head
these
hands
be
employed
to
whose
service
shall
they
be
dedicated
a
question
the
answer
to
which
involves
a
futurity
of
happiness
or
misery
to
a
life
so
dear
to
thee
it
is
recorded
that
god
opened
the
heavens
to
the
patriarch
of
old
and
showed
him
a
ladder
leading
thither
this
ladder
is
let
down
to
every
descendant
of
adam
it
is
offered
to
thy
child
but
he
must
be
taught
to
climb
it
and
let
him
not
attempt
it
by
the
cold
calculations
of
the
head
or
the
mere
impulse
of
the
heart
but
let
all
these
powers
combine
and
the
noble
enterprise
will
be
crowned
with
success
these
powers
are
already
bestowed
on
him
but
to
thee
it
is
given
to
assist
in
calling
them
to
greaves
love
is
the
first
agent
in
education
through
it
the
child
is
led
to
love
and
trust
his
creator
and
his
from
the
theory
of
development
which
lay
at
the
root
of
views
of
education
it
followed
that
the
imparting
of
knowledge
and
the
training
for
special
pursuits
held
only
a
subordinate
position
in
his
scheme
instead
of
merely
considering
what
is
to
be
imparted
to
children
ought
to
consider
first
what
they
may
be
said
already
to
possess
if
not
as
a
developed
at
least
as
an
involved
faculty
capable
of
development
or
if
instead
of
speaking
thus
in
the
abstract
we
will
but
recollect
that
it
is
to
the
great
author
of
life
that
man
owes
the
possession
and
is
responsible
for
the
use
of
his
innate
faculties
education
should
not
simply
decide
what
is
to
be
made
of
a
child
but
rather
inquire
what
it
was
intended
that
he
should
become
what
is
his
destiny
as
a
created
and
responsible
being
what
are
his
faculties
as
a
rational
and
moral
being
what
are
the
means
for
their
perfection
and
the
end
held
out
as
the
highest
object
of
their
efforts
by
the
almighty
father
of
all
both
in
creation
and
in
the
page
of
revelation
education
then
must
consist
continual
benevolent
with
the
object
of
calling
forth
all
the
faculties
which
providence
has
implanted
and
its
province
thus
enlarged
will
yet
be
with
less
difficulty
surveyed
from
one
point
of
view
and
will
have
more
of
a
systematic
and
truly
philosophical
character
than
an
incoherent
mass
of
without
unity
of
principle
and
gone
through
without
too
often
usurps
its
the
task
then
is
to
superintend
and
promote
the
development
morally
intellectually
and
physically
essential
principle
of
education
is
not
teaching
said
pestalozzi
is
again
he
says
child
loves
and
believes
before
it
thinks
and
and
in
a
very
striking
passage
where
he
compares
the
development
of
the
various
powers
of
a
human
being
to
the
development
of
a
tree
he
says
forces
of
the
and
in
the
formation
of
immortal
man
what
the
root
is
for
the
so
according
to
pestalozzi
a
child
without
faith
and
love
can
no
more
grow
up
to
be
what
he
should
be
than
a
tree
can
grow
without
a
root
apart
from
this
vital
truth
there
can
be
no
such
thing
as
pestalozzianism
yet
when
all
is
thought
and
said
the
heart
still
overrules
the
it
is
our
hearts
and
affections
that
lead
us
right
or
wrong
far
more
than
our
intellects
in
advocating
the
training
of
the
minds
of
the
people
lord
derby
once
remarked
that
as
chairman
of
quarter
sessions
he
had
found
most
of
the
culprits
brought
before
him
were
stupid
and
ignorant
it
certainly
can
not
be
denied
that
the
commonest
kind
of
criminal
is
bad
in
every
way
he
has
his
body
ruined
by
debauchery
his
intellect
almost
in
abeyance
and
his
heart
and
affections
set
on
what
is
vile
and
degrading
if
you
could
cultivate
his
intellect
you
would
certainly
raise
him
out
of
the
lowest
and
by
far
the
largest
of
the
criminal
classes
but
he
might
become
a
criminal
of
a
type
less
disgusting
in
externals
but
in
reality
far
more
dangerous
the
most
atrocious
miscreant
of
our
time
if
not
of
all
time
was
a
man
who
contrived
a
machine
to
sink
ships
in
his
only
object
being
to
gain
a
sum
of
money
on
a
false
insurance
this
man
was
a
type
of
the
of
criminals
had
received
an
intellectual
training
and
could
not
have
been
described
by
lord
derby
as
ignorant
or
stupid
pestalozzi
then
much
as
he
valued
the
development
of
the
intellect
put
first
the
moral
and
religious
influence
of
education
and
with
him
moral
and
religious
were
one
and
the
same
he
protested
against
the
ordinary
routine
of
elementary
education
because
in
it
the
flesh
predominated
over
the
spirit
everywhere
the
divine
element
was
cast
into
the
shade
everywhere
selfishness
and
the
passions
were
taken
as
the
motives
of
action
everywhere
mechanical
habits
usurped
the
place
of
intelligent
education
for
the
people
must
be
different
to
this
does
not
live
by
bread
alone
every
child
needs
a
religious
development
every
child
needs
to
know
how
to
pray
to
god
in
all
simplicity
but
with
faith
and
the
religious
element
does
not
run
through
the
whole
of
education
this
element
will
have
little
influence
on
the
life
it
remains
formal
or
and
pestalozzi
sums
up
the
essentials
of
popular
education
in
the
words
child
accustomed
from
his
earliest
years
to
pray
to
think
and
to
work
is
already
more
than
half
here
we
see
the
main
requisites
first
the
child
must
pray
with
faith
and
love
next
he
must
child
must
think
exclaims
the
schoolmaster
he
not
learn
to
which
pestalozzi
would
have
replied
certainly
he
learning
was
not
in
estimation
as
in
the
and
thing
but
learning
was
with
him
something
very
different
from
the
learning
imparted
by
the
ordinary
schoolmaster
pestalozzi
was
very
imperfectly
acquainted
with
the
thoughts
and
efforts
of
his
predecessors
but
the
one
book
on
education
which
he
had
studied
had
freed
him
from
the
of
the
schoolroom
this
book
was
the
of
rousseau
and
from
it
he
came
no
less
than
rousseau
himself
to
despise
the
learning
of
the
schoolmaster
but
when
he
had
to
face
the
problem
of
organizing
a
course
of
education
for
the
people
pestalozzi
did
not
agree
with
rousseau
that
the
first
twelve
years
should
be
spent
in
no
the
children
must
learn
but
they
must
learn
in
such
a
way
as
to
develop
all
the
powers
of
the
mind
and
so
pestalozzi
was
led
to
what
he
considered
his
great
discovery
that
all
instruction
must
be
based
on
the
germans
who
have
devoted
so
much
thought
and
care
and
effort
to
education
greatly
honour
pestalozzi
and
as
his
disciples
aim
at
making
all
elementary
instruction
we
english
have
troubled
ourselves
so
little
about
pestalozzi
or
i
might
say
about
the
theory
of
education
that
we
have
not
cared
to
get
equivalent
words
for
and
for
has
lately
been
tried
but
this
is
in
two
ways
defective
for
there
may
be
beyond
the
range
of
the
senses
and
there
is
in
an
an
active
as
well
as
a
passive
element
and
this
the
word
does
not
convey
the
active
part
is
brought
out
better
by
word
used
by
joseph
payne
and
james
macalister
but
this
seems
hardly
wide
enough
other
writers
of
english
borrow
words
straight
from
the
french
and
talk
about
and
words
which
were
taken
first
i
believe
by
kant
from
the
latin
look
at
attention
and
i
think
we
shall
be
wise
in
following
these
writers
on
good
authority
i
have
heard
of
a
german
professor
who
when
asked
if
he
had
read
some
large
work
recently
published
in
the
distressing
type
of
his
nation
replied
that
he
had
not
he
was
waiting
for
a
french
translation
if
the
germans
find
that
the
french
express
their
thoughts
more
clearly
than
they
can
themselves
we
may
think
ourselves
fortunate
when
the
french
will
act
as
interpreters
i
therefore
gladly
turn
to
buisson
and
translate
what
he
says
about
is
just
the
most
natural
and
most
spontaneous
action
of
human
intelligence
the
action
by
which
the
mind
seizes
a
reality
without
effort
hesitation
or
it
is
a
apperception
made
as
it
were
at
a
glance
if
it
has
to
do
with
some
matter
within
the
province
of
the
senses
the
senses
perceive
it
at
once
here
we
have
the
simplest
case
of
all
the
most
common
the
most
easily
noted
if
the
thing
concerned
is
an
idea
a
reality
that
is
beyond
the
reach
of
the
senses
we
still
say
that
we
seize
it
by
intuition
when
all
that
is
necessary
is
that
it
present
itself
to
the
mind
and
the
mind
at
once
grasps
it
and
is
satisfied
with
it
without
any
need
of
proof
or
investigation
we
advance
by
intuition
whenever
our
mind
acting
by
the
senses
or
by
the
judgment
or
by
the
conscience
knows
things
with
the
same
amount
of
evidence
and
the
same
amount
of
speed
that
a
distinct
view
of
an
object
affords
the
eye
so
intuition
is
no
separate
faculty
it
is
nothing
strange
or
new
in
the
mind
of
man
it
is
just
the
mind
itself
recognising
what
exists
in
it
or
around
conférences
péd
faites
aux
delagrave
so
the
to
keep
the
french
name
for
it
is
of
very
wide
application
appeals
to
this
force
to
this
glance
of
the
mind
to
this
spontaneous
spring
of
the
intelligence
towards
it
sets
the
mind
to
work
in
following
his
own
intellectual
instincts
if
in
our
teaching
we
can
use
it
we
shall
have
gained
as
buisson
says
the
best
helper
in
the
world
the
pupil
if
he
can
be
got
to
take
an
active
part
in
the
instruction
all
difficulty
vanishes
at
once
instead
of
having
to
drag
him
along
you
will
see
him
delighted
to
keep
you
company
according
to
buisson
there
are
three
kinds
of
intellectual
and
moral
similarly
jullien
de
vol
j
says
that
there
are
of
the
as
well
as
of
the
external
the
are
four
in
number
first
the
sense
for
the
true
second
the
sense
for
the
beautiful
third
the
sense
for
the
good
fourth
the
sense
for
the
infinite
without
settling
whether
this
analysis
is
complete
we
shall
have
no
difficulty
in
admitting
that
both
body
and
mind
have
faculties
by
means
of
which
we
apprehend
lay
hold
of
what
is
true
and
right
and
it
is
on
the
use
of
these
faculties
that
pestalozzi
bases
instruction
no
englishman
may
have
found
a
good
word
to
indicate
but
one
englishman
at
least
had
the
idea
of
it
long
before
pestalozzi
more
than
a
century
earlier
locke
had
called
knowledge
internal
perception
of
the
is
seeing
said
he
if
it
be
so
it
is
madness
to
persuade
ourselves
we
do
so
by
another
eyes
let
him
use
never
so
many
words
to
tell
us
that
what
he
asserts
is
very
thus
in
theory
pestalozzi
was
however
unconsciously
a
follower
of
locke
but
in
practice
they
went
far
asunder
thoughts
were
constantly
occupied
with
philosophical
investigations
and
he
seems
to
have
made
small
account
of
the
intellectual
power
of
children
and
to
have
supposed
that
they
can
not
anything
at
all
so
he
cared
little
what
was
taught
them
and
till
they
reached
the
age
of
reason
the
tutor
might
give
such
lessons
as
would
be
useful
to
gentlemen
the
avowed
object
being
to
them
from
his
follower
rousseau
preferred
that
the
mind
should
not
be
filled
with
the
traditional
lore
of
the
schoolroom
and
that
the
instructor
when
the
youth
reached
the
age
of
twelve
should
find
unfurnished
apartment
to
then
came
pestalozzi
and
he
saw
that
at
whatever
age
the
instructor
began
to
teach
the
child
he
would
not
find
an
unfurnished
apartment
seeing
that
every
child
learns
continuously
from
the
hour
of
its
birth
and
how
does
the
child
learn
not
by
repeating
words
which
express
the
thoughts
feelings
and
experiences
of
other
people
but
by
his
own
experiences
and
feelings
and
by
the
thoughts
which
these
suggest
to
him
elementary
education
then
on
its
intellectual
side
is
teaching
the
child
to
think
the
proper
subjects
of
thought
for
children
pestalozzi
held
to
be
the
surroundings
the
realities
of
their
own
lives
the
things
that
affect
them
and
arouse
their
feelings
and
interests
perhaps
he
did
not
emphasize
as
much
as
herbart
has
done
since
but
clearly
an
or
is
only
possible
when
the
child
is
interested
in
the
thing
observed
the
art
of
teaching
in
system
consists
in
analyzing
the
knowledge
that
the
children
should
acquire
about
their
surroundings
arranging
it
in
a
regular
sequence
and
bringing
it
to
the
consciousness
gradually
and
in
the
way
in
which
their
minds
will
act
upon
it
in
this
way
they
learn
slowly
but
all
they
learn
is
their
own
they
are
not
like
the
crow
drest
up
in
feathers
for
they
have
not
appropriated
any
knowledge
todte
as
diesterweg
has
it
and
it
can
not
be
said
of
them
know
about
much
but
nothing
kennen
viel
und
wissen
their
knowledge
is
actual
knowledge
for
they
are
taught
not
to
think
but
and
to
exercise
their
powers
of
observation
and
draw
conclusions
from
their
own
experience
the
teacher
simply
furnishes
materials
and
occasions
for
this
exercise
in
observing
and
as
it
goes
on
gives
his
benevolent
superintendence
they
learn
slowly
for
another
reason
according
to
pestalozzi
the
first
conceptions
must
be
dwelt
upon
till
they
are
distinct
and
firmly
fixed
buss
tells
us
that
when
he
first
joined
pestalozzi
at
burgdorf
the
delay
over
the
prime
elements
seemed
to
him
a
waste
of
time
but
that
afterwards
he
was
convinced
of
its
being
the
right
plan
and
felt
that
the
failure
of
his
own
education
was
due
to
its
incoherent
and
desultory
character
only
says
pestalozzi
the
first
elements
of
knowledge
in
every
subject
the
most
important
bearing
on
its
complete
outline
but
the
confidence
and
interest
are
gained
by
perfect
attainment
even
in
the
lowest
stage
of
we
have
seen
that
pestalozzi
would
have
children
learn
to
pray
to
think
and
to
in
schools
for
the
the
parents
or
friends
of
a
boy
sometimes
say
is
no
need
for
him
to
work
he
will
be
very
well
from
this
kind
of
demoralization
pupils
were
free
they
would
have
to
work
and
pestalozzi
wished
them
to
learn
to
work
as
soon
as
possible
in
this
way
he
sought
to
increase
their
and
to
unite
their
with
their
life
beyond
it
pestalozzi
was
tremendously
in
earnest
and
he
wished
the
children
also
to
take
instruction
seriously
he
was
totally
opposed
to
the
notion
which
had
found
favour
with
many
great
authorities
as
locke
and
basedow
that
instruction
should
always
be
given
in
the
guise
of
amusement
am
convinced
says
he
such
a
notion
will
for
ever
preclude
solidity
of
knowledge
and
for
want
of
sufficient
exertions
on
the
part
of
the
pupils
will
lead
to
that
very
result
which
i
wish
to
avoid
by
my
principle
of
a
constant
employment
of
the
thinking
powers
a
child
must
very
early
in
life
be
taught
the
lesson
that
exertion
is
indispensable
for
the
attainment
of
to
xxiv
but
he
should
be
taught
at
the
same
time
that
exertion
is
not
an
evil
and
he
should
be
encouraged
not
frightened
into
it
healthy
exertion
whether
of
body
or
mind
is
always
attended
with
a
feeling
of
satisfaction
amounting
to
pleasure
and
where
this
pleasure
is
absent
the
instructor
has
failed
in
producing
proper
exertion
as
pestalozzi
says
children
are
inattentive
and
apparently
take
no
interest
in
a
lesson
the
teacher
should
always
first
look
to
himself
for
the
but
though
he
took
so
serious
a
view
of
instruction
he
made
instruction
include
and
indeed
give
a
prominent
place
to
the
arts
of
singing
and
drawing
in
the
pestalozzian
schools
singing
found
immense
favour
with
both
the
masters
and
the
pupils
and
the
collection
of
songs
by
nägeli
a
master
at
yverdun
became
famous
drawing
too
was
practised
by
all
as
pestalozzi
writes
to
greaves
xxiv
person
who
is
in
the
habit
of
drawing
especially
from
nature
will
easily
perceive
many
circumstances
which
are
commonly
overlooked
and
will
form
a
much
more
correct
impression
even
of
such
objects
as
he
does
not
stop
to
examine
minutely
than
one
who
has
never
been
taught
to
look
upon
what
he
sees
with
an
intention
of
reproducing
a
likeness
of
it
the
attention
to
the
exact
shape
of
the
whole
and
the
proportion
of
the
parts
which
is
requisite
for
the
taking
of
an
adequate
sketch
is
converted
into
a
habit
and
becomes
productive
both
of
instruction
and
i
have
now
endeavoured
to
point
out
the
main
features
of
pestalozzianism
the
following
is
the
summing
up
of
these
features
given
by
morf
in
his
contribution
to
biography
instruction
must
be
based
on
the
own
experience
das
fundament
des
unterrichts
ist
die
anschauung
what
the
learner
experiences
and
observes
must
be
connected
with
language
the
time
for
learning
is
not
the
time
for
judging
not
the
time
for
criticism
in
every
department
instruction
must
begin
with
the
simplest
elements
and
starting
from
these
must
be
carried
on
step
by
step
according
to
the
development
of
the
child
that
is
it
must
be
brought
into
psychological
sequence
at
each
point
the
instructor
shall
not
go
forward
till
that
part
of
the
subject
has
become
the
proper
intellectual
possession
of
the
learner
instruction
must
follow
the
path
of
development
not
the
path
of
lecturing
teaching
or
telling
to
the
educator
the
individuality
of
the
child
must
be
sacred
not
the
acquisition
of
knowledge
or
skill
is
the
main
object
of
elementary
instruction
but
the
development
and
strengthening
of
the
powers
of
the
mind
with
knowledge
must
come
power
with
information
skill
intercourse
between
educator
and
pupil
and
school
discipline
especially
must
be
based
on
and
controlled
by
love
instruction
shall
be
subordinated
to
the
aim
of
the
ground
of
bringing
up
lies
in
the
relation
of
mother
and
child
having
now
seen
in
which
direction
pestalozzi
would
start
the
let
us
examine
with
reference
to
england
only
the
direction
in
which
it
is
travelling
at
present
for
educational
purposes
we
may
with
lord
beaconsfield
regard
the
english
as
composed
of
two
nations
the
rich
and
the
poor
let
us
consider
these
separately
in
the
case
of
the
rich
we
find
that
the
worst
part
of
our
educational
part
most
wrong
in
theory
and
pernicious
in
the
schooling
of
young
children
say
between
six
and
twelve
years
old
before
the
age
of
six
some
few
are
fortunate
enough
to
attend
a
good
kindergarten
but
the
opportunity
of
doing
this
is
at
present
rare
and
for
most
children
of
parents
there
is
up
to
six
years
old
little
or
no
organised
instruction
pestalozzi
would
have
every
mother
made
capable
of
giving
such
instruction
froebel
would
have
every
child
sent
to
a
skilled
it
seems
to
me
beyond
question
that
children
gain
immensely
from
joining
a
kindergarten
but
where
this
is
impossible
perhaps
the
mother
may
leave
the
child
to
the
series
of
impressions
which
come
to
its
senses
without
any
regular
order
according
to
the
first
lord
lytton
the
interference
might
remind
us
of
the
man
who
thought
his
bees
would
make
honey
faster
if
instead
of
going
in
search
of
flowers
they
were
shut
up
and
had
flowers
brought
to
them
the
way
in
which
young
children
turn
from
object
to
object
like
the
bees
from
flower
to
flower
seems
to
show
that
at
this
stage
their
intellectual
training
goes
on
whether
we
help
it
or
not
there
is
no
doubt
an
education
for
children
however
young
and
the
mother
is
the
teacher
but
the
lessons
have
more
to
do
with
the
heart
than
the
head
but
the
time
for
regular
teaching
comes
at
last
and
what
is
to
be
done
then
let
us
consider
briefly
what
done
hitherto
the
only
defence
ever
made
of
our
leading
up
to
residence
at
a
university
has
been
that
it
aims
not
at
giving
knowledge
but
at
training
the
mind
youths
then
are
supposed
to
be
engaged
not
in
gaining
knowledge
but
in
training
their
faculties
for
adult
life
but
when
we
come
to
provide
for
the
of
children
we
never
think
of
training
their
faculties
for
youth
but
endeavour
solely
to
inculcate
what
will
then
come
in
useful
we
see
clearly
enough
that
it
would
be
absurd
to
cram
the
mind
of
a
youth
with
laws
of
science
or
art
or
commerce
which
he
could
not
understand
on
the
ground
that
the
of
these
things
might
save
him
trouble
in
but
we
do
not
hesitate
to
sacrifice
childhood
to
the
learning
by
heart
of
grammar
rules
latin
declensions
historical
dates
and
the
like
with
no
thought
whatever
of
the
faculties
but
simply
with
a
view
of
giving
him
knowledge
that
will
come
in
useful
five
or
six
years
afterwards
we
do
not
treat
youths
thus
probably
because
we
have
more
sympathy
with
them
or
at
least
understand
them
better
the
intellectual
life
to
which
the
senses
and
the
imagination
are
subordinated
in
the
man
has
already
begun
in
the
youth
in
an
inferior
degree
he
can
do
what
the
man
can
do
and
understand
what
the
man
can
understand
he
has
already
some
notion
of
reasoning
and
abstraction
and
generalisation
but
with
the
child
it
is
very
different
his
active
faculties
may
be
said
almost
to
differ
in
kind
from
a
he
has
a
feeling
for
the
sensuous
world
which
he
will
lose
as
he
grows
up
his
strong
imagination
under
no
control
of
the
reason
is
constantly
at
work
building
castles
in
the
air
and
investing
the
doll
or
the
with
all
the
properties
of
the
things
they
represent
his
feelings
and
affections
easily
excited
find
an
object
to
love
or
dislike
in
every
person
and
thing
he
meets
with
on
the
other
hand
he
has
only
vague
notions
of
the
abstract
and
has
no
interest
except
in
actual
known
persons
animals
and
things
there
is
then
between
the
child
of
eight
or
nine
and
the
youth
of
fourteen
or
fifteen
a
greater
difference
than
between
the
youth
and
the
man
of
twenty
and
this
demands
a
corresponding
difference
in
their
studies
and
yet
as
matters
are
carried
on
now
the
child
is
too
often
kept
to
the
drudgery
of
learning
by
rote
mere
collections
of
hard
words
perhaps
too
in
a
foreign
language
and
absorbed
in
the
present
he
is
not
much
comforted
by
the
assurance
that
these
things
will
come
in
useful
how
to
educate
the
child
is
doubtless
the
most
difficult
problem
of
all
and
it
is
generally
allotted
to
those
who
are
the
least
likely
to
find
a
satisfactory
solution
the
earliest
educator
of
the
children
of
many
rich
parents
is
the
person
not
usually
distinguished
by
either
intellectual
or
moral
excellence
at
an
early
age
this
educator
is
superseded
by
the
preparatory
school
taken
as
a
body
the
ladies
who
open
for
young
can
not
be
said
to
hold
enlarged
views
or
indeed
any
views
whatever
on
the
subject
of
education
their
intention
is
not
so
much
to
cultivate
the
faculties
as
to
make
a
livelihood
and
to
hear
no
complaints
that
pupils
who
have
left
them
have
been
found
deficient
in
the
expected
knowledge
by
the
master
of
the
next
school
if
anyone
would
investigate
the
sort
of
teaching
which
is
considered
adapted
to
the
capacity
of
children
at
this
stage
let
him
look
into
a
standard
work
still
in
vogue
from
which
the
young
of
both
sexes
acquire
a
great
quantity
and
variety
of
learning
the
whole
of
ancient
and
modern
history
and
biography
together
with
the
heathen
mythology
the
planetary
system
and
the
names
of
all
the
constellations
lying
very
compactly
in
about
pages
unfortunately
moreover
from
the
gentility
of
these
ladies
their
bodies
are
often
treated
in
preparatory
schools
no
less
injuriously
than
their
minds
it
may
be
natural
in
a
child
to
use
his
lungs
and
delight
in
noise
but
this
can
hardly
be
considered
so
the
tendency
is
as
far
as
possible
suppressed
it
is
found
too
that
if
children
are
allowed
to
run
about
they
get
dirty
and
spoil
their
clothes
and
do
not
look
like
gentlemen
so
they
are
made
to
take
exercise
in
a
much
more
genteel
fashion
walking
slowly
gloves
at
nine
or
ten
years
old
boys
are
commonly
put
to
a
school
taught
by
masters
here
they
lose
sight
of
their
gloves
and
learn
the
use
of
their
limbs
but
their
minds
are
not
so
fortunate
as
their
bodies
the
studies
of
the
school
have
been
arranged
without
any
thought
of
their
peculiar
needs
the
youngest
class
is
generally
the
largest
often
much
the
largest
and
it
is
handed
over
to
the
least
competent
and
worst
paid
master
on
the
staff
of
teachers
the
reason
is
that
little
boys
are
found
to
learn
the
tasks
imposed
upon
them
very
slowly
a
youth
or
a
man
who
came
fresh
to
the
latin
grammar
would
learn
in
a
morning
as
much
as
the
master
with
great
labour
can
get
into
children
in
a
week
it
is
thought
therefore
that
the
best
teaching
should
be
applied
where
it
will
have
the
most
obvious
results
if
anyone
were
to
say
to
the
manager
of
a
school
master
who
takes
the
lowest
form
teaches
badly
and
the
children
learn
he
would
perhaps
say
likely
but
if
i
paid
a
much
higher
salary
and
got
a
better
man
they
would
learn
but
the
only
thing
the
thinks
of
is
how
much
do
the
little
boys
learn
of
what
is
taught
in
the
higher
forms
how
their
faculties
are
being
developed
or
whether
they
have
any
faculties
except
for
reading
writing
and
arithmetic
and
for
getting
by
heart
he
is
not
so
as
to
enquire
with
reference
to
the
education
of
the
first
of
our
nations
it
seems
then
pretty
clear
that
pestalozzi
would
require
that
the
should
be
turned
and
started
in
a
totally
different
direction
what
about
the
education
of
the
other
a
nation
of
which
the
verb
has
for
many
centuries
been
used
in
the
passive
voice
but
can
be
used
in
that
voice
no
longer
a
century
ago
with
the
partial
exception
of
scotland
and
massachusetts
there
was
no
such
thing
as
school
education
for
the
people
to
be
found
anywhere
in
europe
or
america
but
from
onwards
power
has
been
passing
more
and
more
from
the
few
to
the
many
and
as
a
natural
consequence
for
which
we
have
not
yet
found
a
name
have
become
of
vast
importance
everywhere
the
germans
as
we
have
seen
have
been
the
disciples
of
pestalozzi
and
their
elementary
education
in
everything
bears
traces
of
his
ideas
the
english
have
organised
a
great
system
of
elementary
education
in
total
ignorance
of
pestalozzi
as
usual
we
seem
to
have
supposed
that
the
right
system
would
come
to
us
but
has
it
come
the
children
of
the
poor
are
now
compelled
by
the
law
to
attend
an
elementary
school
what
sort
of
an
education
has
the
law
there
provided
for
them
the
education
department
professes
to
measure
everything
by
results
let
us
do
the
same
suppose
that
on
his
leaving
school
we
wished
to
forecast
a
future
what
should
we
try
to
find
out
about
him
no
doubt
we
should
ask
what
he
knew
but
this
would
not
be
by
any
means
the
main
thing
his
skill
would
interest
us
and
still
more
would
his
state
of
health
but
what
we
should
ask
first
and
foremost
is
this
whom
does
he
love
whom
does
he
admire
and
imitate
what
does
he
care
about
what
interests
him
it
is
only
when
the
answers
to
these
questions
are
satisfactory
that
we
can
think
hopefully
of
his
future
and
it
is
only
in
so
far
as
the
has
tended
to
make
the
answers
satisfactory
that
it
deserves
our
approval
schools
such
as
pestalozzi
designed
would
have
thus
deserved
our
approval
but
we
can
not
say
this
of
the
schools
into
which
the
children
of
the
english
poor
are
now
driven
in
these
schools
the
heart
and
the
affections
are
not
thought
of
the
powers
of
neither
mind
nor
body
are
developed
by
exercise
and
the
children
do
not
acquire
any
interests
that
will
raise
or
benefit
them
an
advocate
of
our
system
would
not
deny
this
but
would
probably
say
question
for
us
to
consider
is
not
what
is
the
best
that
in
the
most
favourable
circumstances
might
be
attempted
but
what
is
the
best
that
in
very
restricted
and
by
no
means
favourable
circumstances
we
are
likely
to
get
the
teachers
in
our
schools
are
not
pestalozzis
but
only
ordinary
men
and
women
and
still
worse
ordinary
boys
and
girls
it
would
be
of
no
use
talking
to
our
teachers
still
less
our
about
developing
the
affections
and
the
mental
or
bodily
powers
of
the
children
all
such
talk
could
end
in
nothing
but
silly
cant
as
for
character
we
expect
the
school
to
cultivate
in
the
children
habits
of
order
neatness
industry
beyond
this
we
can
not
and
yet
though
this
seems
reasonable
we
feel
that
it
is
not
quite
satisfactory
if
so
much
depends
in
all
of
us
on
hope
and
love
we
can
hardly
consider
a
system
of
education
that
entirely
ignores
them
to
be
well
adapted
to
the
needs
of
human
nature
if
pestalozzi
was
right
we
must
be
wrong
we
have
never
supposed
the
object
of
the
school
to
be
the
development
of
the
faculties
of
heart
of
head
and
of
hand
but
we
have
thought
of
nothing
but
first
of
all
to
read
write
and
cipher
and
then
in
schools
one
or
more
may
be
taken
up
and
a
grant
obtained
for
them
the
sole
object
both
of
managers
and
teachers
is
to
prepare
for
the
inspector
who
comes
once
a
year
and
from
an
examination
of
five
hours
or
so
pronounces
on
what
the
children
have
learnt
the
engineer
most
concerned
in
the
construction
of
this
machine
the
right
hon
robert
lowe
announced
that
there
could
be
such
thing
as
a
science
of
education
and
as
when
we
have
no
opinion
of
our
own
we
always
adopt
the
opinion
of
some
positive
person
we
took
his
word
for
it
but
what
if
the
confident
lowe
was
mistaken
what
if
there
such
a
science
and
the
aim
of
it
is
that
children
should
grow
up
not
so
much
to
something
as
to
something
in
this
case
we
shall
be
obliged
sooner
or
later
to
give
up
lowe
and
to
come
round
to
pestalozzi
science
is
correct
inferences
drawn
from
the
facts
of
the
universe
and
where
such
science
exists
confident
assertions
that
it
does
not
and
can
not
exist
are
dangerous
for
the
confident
persons
and
for
those
who
follow
them
even
if
is
no
such
thing
as
a
science
of
education
such
a
thing
as
there
is
and
this
is
just
what
lowe
and
we
may
say
the
english
practically
deny
they
make
arrangements
for
instruction
and
mete
out
according
to
the
results
obtained
but
they
totally
fail
to
conceive
of
the
existence
of
education
which
has
instruction
among
its
various
agents
in
one
respect
the
analogy
between
the
educator
and
child
and
the
gardener
and
plant
an
analogy
in
which
pestalozzi
no
less
than
froebel
delighted
entirely
breaks
down
the
gardener
has
to
study
the
conditions
necessary
for
the
health
and
development
of
the
plant
but
these
conditions
lie
outside
his
own
life
and
are
independent
of
it
with
the
educator
it
is
different
like
the
gardener
he
can
create
nothing
in
the
child
but
unlike
the
gardener
he
can
further
the
development
only
of
that
which
exists
in
himself
he
in
the
young
the
intelligence
and
the
sense
of
what
is
just
the
love
of
what
is
beautiful
the
admiration
of
what
is
noble
but
this
he
can
do
only
by
his
own
intelligence
and
his
own
enthusiasm
for
what
is
just
and
beautiful
and
noble
even
industry
is
in
many
cases
from
the
teacher
in
a
volume
of
essays
originally
published
in
the
in
which
some
men
distinguished
as
scholars
or
in
literature
in
the
united
states
have
given
an
account
of
their
early
years
we
find
that
almost
in
every
case
they
date
their
intellectual
industry
and
growth
from
the
time
when
they
came
under
the
influence
of
some
inspiring
teacher
thus
even
for
instruction
and
still
more
for
education
the
great
force
is
this
is
a
truth
which
all
our
overlook
they
wage
their
controversies
and
have
their
triumphs
and
defeats
about
unessentials
and
leave
the
essentials
to
in
such
questions
as
whether
the
church
catechism
shall
or
shall
not
be
taught
whether
natural
science
shall
or
shall
not
figure
in
the
without
scientific
teachers
it
can
figure
nowhere
else
whether
the
parents
or
the
government
shall
pay
for
each
child
twopence
or
threepence
a
week
whether
the
ratepayers
shall
or
shall
not
be
among
the
managers
in
schools
in
all
questions
of
this
kind
is
not
concerned
and
yet
these
are
the
only
questions
that
we
think
about
in
the
end
it
will
perhaps
dawn
upon
us
that
in
every
school
what
is
important
for
education
is
not
the
but
the
teacher
and
that
so
far
as
are
employed
education
is
impossible
elsewhere
i
have
told
of
a
man
in
the
prime
of
life
he
seemed
between
and
years
old
whose
time
was
entirely
taken
up
in
teaching
a
large
class
of
children
boys
and
girls
of
six
or
seven
years
he
most
certainly
could
and
did
educate
them
both
in
heart
and
mind
he
made
their
lessons
a
delightful
occupation
to
them
and
he
exercised
over
them
the
influence
of
a
good
and
wise
father
here
was
the
right
system
seen
at
its
best
i
do
not
say
that
all
or
even
most
adult
teachers
would
have
exercised
so
good
an
influence
as
this
gentleman
but
so
far
as
they
come
up
to
what
they
ought
to
be
and
might
be
they
do
exercise
such
an
influence
and
this
of
course
can
be
said
of
no
as
regards
schools
then
schools
for
the
rich
and
schools
for
the
poor
the
great
educating
force
is
the
personality
of
the
teacher
before
we
can
have
pestalozzian
schools
we
must
have
pestalozzian
teachers
teachers
must
catch
something
of
spirit
and
enter
into
his
conception
of
their
task
perhaps
some
of
them
will
feel
inclined
to
say
words
no
doubt
and
in
a
sense
very
true
that
education
should
be
the
unfolding
of
the
faculties
according
to
the
divine
idea
but
between
this
high
poetical
theory
and
the
dull
prose
of
actual
there
is
a
great
gulf
fixed
and
we
can
not
attend
to
both
at
the
same
i
know
full
well
the
difference
there
is
between
theories
and
plans
of
education
as
they
seem
to
us
when
we
are
at
leisure
and
can
think
of
them
without
reference
to
particular
pupils
and
when
all
our
energy
is
taxed
to
get
through
our
teaching
and
our
animal
spirits
jaded
by
having
to
keep
order
and
exact
attention
among
veritable
schoolboys
who
do
not
answer
in
all
respects
to
of
the
theorists
but
whilst
admitting
most
heartily
the
difference
here
as
elsewhere
between
the
actual
and
the
ideal
i
think
that
the
dull
prose
of
would
be
less
dull
and
less
prosaic
if
our
aim
was
higher
and
if
we
did
not
contentedly
assume
that
our
present
performances
are
as
good
as
the
nature
of
the
case
will
admit
of
many
teachers
perhaps
i
may
say
most
are
discontented
with
the
greater
number
of
their
pupils
but
it
is
not
so
usual
for
teachers
to
be
discontented
with
themselves
and
yet
even
those
who
are
most
averse
from
theoretical
views
which
they
call
unpractical
would
admit
as
practical
men
that
their
methods
are
probably
susceptible
of
improvement
and
that
even
if
their
methods
are
right
they
themselves
are
by
no
means
perfect
teachers
only
let
the
of
improvement
once
exist
and
the
teacher
will
find
a
new
interest
in
his
work
in
part
the
monotony
so
wearing
to
the
spirits
will
be
done
away
and
he
will
at
times
have
the
encouragement
of
conscious
progress
to
a
man
thus
minded
theorists
may
be
of
great
assistance
his
practical
knowledge
may
indeed
often
show
him
the
absurdity
of
some
pompously
enunciated
principle
and
even
where
the
principles
seem
sound
he
may
smile
at
the
applications
but
the
theorists
will
show
him
many
aspects
of
his
profession
and
will
lead
him
to
make
many
observations
in
it
which
would
otherwise
have
escaped
him
they
will
save
him
from
a
danger
caused
by
the
difficulty
of
getting
anything
done
in
the
the
danger
of
thinking
more
of
means
than
ends
they
will
teach
him
to
examine
what
his
aim
really
is
and
then
whether
he
is
using
the
most
suitable
methods
to
accomplish
it
such
a
theorist
is
pestalozzi
he
points
to
a
high
ideal
and
bids
us
measure
our
modes
of
education
by
it
let
us
not
forget
that
if
we
are
practical
men
we
are
christians
and
as
such
the
ideal
set
before
us
is
the
highest
of
all
ye
perfect
even
as
your
father
in
heaven
is
the
pestalozzian
literature
in
german
and
even
in

now
considerable
but
it
is
still
small

xvii
friedrich
froebel
i
now
approach
the
most
difficult
part
of
my
subject
i
have
endeavoured
to
give
some
account
of
the
lessons
taught
us
by
the
chief
educational
reformers
no
doubt
my
selection
of
these
has
been
made
in
a
fashion
somewhat
arbitrary
and
there
are
names
which
do
not
appear
and
yet
might
reasonably
be
looked
for
if
all
the
chief
educational
reformers
were
supposed
to
be
included
but
the
plan
of
my
book
has
restricted
me
to
a
few
and
i
am
by
no
means
sure
that
some
to
whom
i
have
given
a
chapter
are
as
worthy
of
it
as
some
to
whom
i
have
not
i
have
in
a
measure
been
guided
by
fancy
and
even
by
chance
one
man
however
i
dare
not
leave
out
all
the
best
tendencies
of
modern
thought
on
education
seem
to
me
to
culminate
in
what
was
said
and
done
by
friedrich
froebel
and
i
have
little
doubt
that
he
has
shown
the
right
road
for
further
advance
of
what
he
said
and
did
i
therefore
feel
bound
to
give
the
best
account
i
can
but
i
am
well
aware
that
i
shall
fail
even
more
conspicuously
than
in
other
cases
to
do
him
justice
there
are
some
great
men
who
seem
to
have
access
to
a
world
from
which
we
ordinary
mortals
are
shut
out
like
moses
go
up
into
the
mount
and
the
directions
they
give
us
are
based
upon
what
they
have
seen
in
it
but
we
can
not
go
up
with
them
so
we
feel
that
we
very
imperfectly
understand
them
and
when
there
can
be
not
the
smallest
doubt
of
their
sincerity
we
at
times
hesitate
about
the
nature
of
their
visions
for
myself
i
must
admit
that
i
very
imperfectly
understand
froebel
i
am
convinced
as
i
said
that
he
has
pointed
out
the
right
road
for
our
advance
in
education
but
he
was
perhaps
right
in
saying
may
yet
pass
before
my
view
of
the
human
creature
as
manifested
in
the
child
and
of
the
educational
treatment
it
requires
are
universally
it
has
already
taken
centuries
to
recover
from
the
mistakes
made
at
the
renascence
for
the
full
attainment
of
standpoint
perhaps
a
few
additional
centuries
may
be
necessary
friedrich
wilhelm
august
froebel
was
born
at
oberweissbach
a
village
of
the
thuringian
forest
on
the
april
he
completed
his
seventieth
year
and
died
at
marienthal
near
on
the
june
like
comenius
with
whom
he
had
much
in
common
he
was
neglected
in
his
youth
and
the
remembrance
of
his
own
early
sufferings
made
him
in
after
life
the
more
eager
in
promoting
the
happiness
of
children
his
mother
he
lost
in
his
infancy
and
his
father
the
pastor
of
oberweissbach
and
the
surrounding
district
attended
to
his
parish
but
not
to
his
family
friedrich
soon
had
a
stepmother
and
neglect
was
succeeded
by
stepmotherly
attention
but
a
maternal
uncle
took
pity
on
him
and
for
some
years
gave
him
a
home
a
few
miles
off
at
here
he
went
to
the
village
school
but
like
many
thoughtful
boys
he
passed
for
a
dunce
throughout
life
he
was
always
seeking
for
hidden
connexions
and
an
underlying
unity
in
all
things
in
his
own
words
particularly
in
boyhood
should
become
intimate
with
so
much
with
reference
to
the
details
and
the
outer
forms
of
her
phenomena
as
with
reference
to
the
spirit
of
god
that
lives
in
her
and
rules
over
her
indeed
the
boy
feels
this
deeply
and
demands
of
but
nothing
of
this
unity
was
to
be
perceived
in
the
piecemeal
studies
of
the
school
so
mind
busy
as
it
was
for
itself
would
not
work
for
the
masters
his
was
therefore
thought
more
worthy
of
a
university
education
and
friedrich
was
apprenticed
for
two
years
to
a
forester
left
to
himself
in
the
thuringian
forest
froebel
now
began
to
intimate
with
nature
and
without
scientific
instruction
he
obtained
a
profound
insight
into
the
uniformity
and
essential
unity
of
laws
years
afterwards
the
celebrated
jahn
the
of
the
german
gymnasts
told
a
berlin
student
of
a
queer
fellow
he
had
met
who
made
out
all
sorts
of
wonderful
things
from
stones
and
cobwebs
this
was
froebel
and
the
habit
of
making
out
general
truths
from
the
observation
of
nature
especially
of
plants
and
trees
dated
from
his
solitary
rambles
in
the
forest
no
training
could
have
been
better
suited
to
strengthen
his
inborn
tendency
to
mysticism
and
when
he
left
the
forest
at
the
early
age
of
seventeen
he
seems
to
have
been
possessed
by
the
main
ideas
which
influenced
him
all
his
life
the
conception
which
in
him
dominated
all
others
was
the
of
and
he
longed
to
study
natural
sciences
that
he
might
find
in
them
various
applications
of
universal
laws
with
great
difficulty
he
got
leave
to
join
his
elder
brother
at
the
university
of
jena
and
there
for
a
year
he
went
from
to
hoping
to
grasp
that
connexion
of
the
sciences
which
had
for
him
far
more
attraction
than
any
particular
science
in
itself
but
allowance
of
money
was
very
small
and
his
skill
in
the
management
of
money
was
never
great
so
his
university
career
ended
in
an
imprisonment
of
nine
weeks
for
a
debt
of
thirty
shillings
he
then
returned
home
with
very
poor
prospects
but
much
more
intent
on
what
he
calls
the
course
of
meines
than
on
in
a
worldly
point
of
view
he
was
soon
sent
to
learn
farming
but
was
recalled
in
consequence
of
the
failing
health
of
his
father
in
the
father
died
and
froebel
now
twenty
years
old
had
to
shift
for
himself
it
was
some
time
before
he
found
his
true
vocation
and
for
the
next
half
years
we
find
him
at
work
now
in
one
part
of
germany
now
in
another
sometimes
acting
as
accountant
sometimes
as
private
secretary
but
in
all
this
his
life
was
far
removed
from
his
inner
carried
my
own
world
within
me
he
tells
us
this
it
was
for
which
i
cared
and
which
i
in
spite
of
his
outward
circumstances
he
became
more
and
more
conscious
that
a
great
task
lay
before
him
for
the
good
of
humanity
and
this
consciousness
proved
fatal
to
his
thee
may
fate
soon
give
a
settled
hearth
and
a
loving
thus
he
wrote
in
a
album
in
let
it
keep
wandering
without
rest
and
allow
only
time
to
learn
aright
my
true
relation
to
the
world
and
to
my
own
inner
being
do
thou
give
bread
to
men
be
it
my
effort
to
give
men
to
ed
by
lange
vol
iv
as
yet
the
nature
of
the
task
was
not
clear
to
him
and
it
seemed
determined
by
accident
while
studying
architecture
in
he
became
acquainted
with
the
director
of
a
model
school
who
had
caught
some
of
the
enthusiasm
of
pestalozzi
this
friend
saw
that
true
field
was
education
and
he
persuaded
him
to
give
up
architecture
and
take
a
post
in
the
model
school
very
first
time
he
says
i
found
myself
before
thirty
or
forty
boys
i
felt
thoroughly
at
home
in
fact
i
perceived
that
i
had
at
last
found
my
and
i
wrote
to
my
brother
that
i
was
as
well
pleased
as
the
fish
in
the
water
i
was
inexpressibly
in
this
school
froebel
worked
for
two
years
with
remarkable
success
but
he
felt
more
and
more
his
need
of
preparation
so
he
then
retired
and
undertook
the
education
of
three
lads
of
one
family
even
in
this
he
could
not
satisfy
himself
and
he
obtained
the
consent
to
his
taking
the
boys
to
yverdun
and
there
forming
with
them
a
part
of
the
celebrated
institution
of
pestalozzi
thus
from
till
froebel
was
drinking
in
pestalozzianism
at
the
fountain
head
and
qualifying
himself
to
carry
on
the
work
which
pestalozzi
had
begun
for
the
science
of
education
had
to
deduce
from
experience
principles
which
pestalozzi
himself
could
not
deduce
and
the
pupil
of
pestalozzi
and
a
genius
like
his
master
completed
the
system
taking
the
results
at
which
pestalozzi
had
arrived
through
the
necessities
of
his
position
froebel
developed
the
ideas
involved
in
them
not
by
further
experience
but
by
deduction
from
the
nature
of
man
and
thus
he
attained
to
the
conception
of
true
human
development
and
to
the
requirements
of
true
holding
that
man
and
nature
inasmuch
as
they
proceed
from
the
same
source
must
be
governed
by
the
same
laws
froebel
longed
for
more
knowledge
of
natural
science
even
pestalozzi
seemed
to
him
not
to
science
in
her
he
therefore
determined
to
continue
the
university
course
which
had
been
so
rudely
interrupted
eleven
years
before
and
in
he
began
studying
at
göttingen
whence
he
proceeded
to
berlin
in
his
autobiography
he
tells
us
lectures
for
which
i
had
so
longed
really
came
up
to
the
needs
of
my
mind
and
soul
and
made
me
feel
more
fervently
than
ever
the
certainty
of
the
demonstrable
inner
connexion
of
the
whole
cosmical
development
of
the
universe
i
saw
also
the
possibility
of
becoming
conscious
of
this
absolute
unity
of
the
universe
as
well
as
of
the
diversity
of
things
and
appearances
which
is
perpetually
unfolding
itself
within
that
unity
and
then
when
i
had
made
clear
to
myself
and
brought
fully
home
to
my
consciousness
the
view
that
the
infinitely
varied
phenomena
in
life
work
thought
feeling
and
position
were
all
summed
up
in
the
unity
of
his
personal
existence
i
felt
myself
able
to
turn
my
thoughts
once
more
to
educational
trans
by
michaelis
and
moore
but
again
his
studies
were
interrupted
this
time
by
the
king
of
celebrated
call
my
though
not
a
prussian
froebel
was
heart
and
soul
a
german
he
therefore
responded
to
the
call
enlisted
in
corps
and
went
through
the
campaign
of
his
military
ardour
however
did
not
take
his
mind
off
education
he
writes
far
as
the
fatigues
i
underwent
allowed
i
carried
in
my
thoughts
my
future
calling
as
educator
yes
even
in
the
few
engagements
in
which
i
had
to
take
part
even
in
these
i
could
gather
experience
for
the
task
i
proposed
to
soldiering
showed
him
the
value
of
discipline
and
united
action
how
the
individual
belongs
not
to
himself
but
to
the
whole
body
and
how
the
whole
body
supports
the
individual
froebel
was
rewarded
for
his
patriotism
by
the
friendship
of
two
men
whose
names
will
always
be
associated
with
his
langethal
and
middendorff
these
young
men
ten
years
younger
than
froebel
became
attached
to
him
in
the
field
and
were
ever
afterwards
his
devoted
followers
sacrificing
all
their
prospects
in
life
for
the
sake
of
carrying
out
his
ideas
at
the
peace
of
fontainebleau
signed
in
may
froebel
returned
to
berlin
and
became
curator
of
the
museum
of
mineralogy
under
professor
weiss
in
accepting
this
appointment
from
the
government
he
seemed
to
turn
aside
from
his
work
as
educator
but
if
not
teaching
he
was
learning
the
unity
of
nature
and
human
nature
seemed
more
and
more
to
reveal
itself
to
him
of
the
days
past
in
the
museum
he
afterwards
wrote
was
i
at
the
central
point
of
my
life
and
strife
where
inner
working
and
law
where
life
nature
and
mathematics
were
united
in
the
fixed
crystaline
form
where
a
world
of
symbols
lay
open
to
the
inner
again
he
says
stones
in
my
hand
and
under
my
eye
became
speaking
forms
the
world
of
crystals
declared
to
me
the
life
and
laws
of
life
of
man
and
in
still
but
real
and
sensible
speech
taught
the
true
life
of
and
crystallography
not
only
opened
for
me
a
higher
circle
of
knowledge
and
insight
but
also
showed
me
a
higher
goal
for
my
inquiry
my
speculation
and
my
endeavour
nature
and
man
now
seemed
to
me
mutually
to
explain
each
other
through
all
their
numberless
various
stages
of
development
man
as
i
saw
receives
from
a
knowledge
of
natural
objects
even
because
of
their
immense
diversity
a
foundation
for
and
a
guidance
towards
a
knowledge
of
himself
and
life
and
a
preparation
for
the
manifestation
of
that
more
and
more
the
thought
possessed
him
that
the
one
thing
needful
for
man
was
unity
of
development
perfect
evolution
in
accordance
with
the
laws
of
his
being
such
evolution
as
science
discovers
in
the
other
organisms
of
nature
he
at
first
intended
to
become
a
teacher
of
natural
science
but
before
long
wider
views
dawned
upon
him
langethal
and
middendorff
were
in
berlin
engaged
in
tuition
froebel
gave
them
regular
instruction
in
his
theory
and
at
length
counting
on
their
support
he
resolved
to
set
about
realising
his
own
idea
of
new
this
was
in
three
years
before
one
of
his
brothers
a
clergyman
had
died
of
fever
caught
from
the
french
prisoners
his
widow
was
still
living
in
the
parsonage
at
griesheim
a
village
on
the
ilm
froebel
gave
up
his
post
in
berlin
and
set
out
for
griesheim
on
foot
spending
his
very
last
groschen
on
the
way
for
bread
here
he
undertook
the
education
of
his
orphan
niece
and
nephews
and
also
of
two
more
nephews
sent
him
by
another
brother
with
these
he
opened
a
school
and
wrote
to
middendorff
and
langethal
to
come
and
help
in
the
experiment
middendorff
came
at
once
langethal
a
year
or
two
later
when
the
school
had
been
moved
to
keilhau
another
of
the
thuringian
villages
which
became
the
mecca
of
the
new
faith
in
keilhau
froebel
langethal
middendorff
and
barop
a
relation
of
all
married
and
formed
an
educational
community
such
zeal
could
not
be
fruitless
and
the
school
gradually
increased
though
for
many
years
its
teachers
with
froebel
at
their
head
were
in
the
greatest
straits
for
money
and
at
times
even
for
food
karl
froebel
who
was
brought
up
in
the
school
tells
how
on
one
occasion
he
and
the
other
children
were
sent
to
ramble
in
the
woods
till
some
of
the
provided
for
the
coming
year
had
been
turned
into
bread
for
them
besides
these
difficulties
the
community
suffered
from
the
panic
and
reaction
after
the
murder
of
kotzebue
and
were
persecuted
as
a
nest
of
demagogues
but
new
was
sufficiently
successful
to
attract
notice
from
all
quarters
and
when
he
had
been
ten
years
at
keilhau
froebel
published
his
great
work
education
of
four
years
later
he
determined
to
start
other
institutions
in
connexion
with
the
parent
institution
at
keilhau
and
being
offered
by
a
private
friend
the
use
of
a
castle
on
the
wartensee
in
the
canton
of
lucerne
he
left
keilhau
under
the
direction
of
barop
and
with
langethal
made
a
settlement
in
switzerland
the
ground
however
was
very
ill
chosen
the
catholic
clergy
resisted
what
they
considered
as
a
protestant
invasion
and
the
experiment
on
the
wartensee
and
at
willisau
in
the
same
canton
to
which
the
institution
was
moved
in
never
had
a
fair
chance
it
was
in
vain
that
middendorff
at
call
left
his
wife
and
family
at
keilhau
and
laboured
for
four
years
in
switzerland
without
once
seeing
them
the
swiss
institution
never
flourished
but
the
swiss
government
wished
to
turn
to
account
the
presence
of
the
great
educator
so
young
teachers
were
sent
to
froebel
for
instruction
and
finally
he
removed
to
burgdorf
a
town
already
famous
from
labours
there
thirty
years
earlier
to
undertake
the
establishment
of
a
public
orphanage
and
also
to
superintend
a
course
of
teaching
for
schoolmasters
the
elementary
teachers
of
the
canton
were
to
spend
three
months
every
alternate
year
at
burgdorf
and
there
compare
experiences
and
learn
of
distinguished
men
such
as
froebel
and
bitzius
in
his
conferences
with
these
teachers
froebel
found
that
the
schools
suffered
from
the
state
of
the
raw
material
brought
into
them
till
the
school
age
was
reached
the
children
were
entirely
neglected
conception
of
harmonious
development
naturally
led
him
to
attach
much
importance
to
the
earliest
years
and
his
great
work
on
education
of
published
as
early
as
deals
chiefly
with
the
education
of
children
at
burgdorf
his
thoughts
were
much
occupied
with
the
proper
treatment
of
children
and
in
scheming
for
them
a
graduated
course
of
exercises
modelled
on
the
games
in
which
he
observed
them
to
be
most
interested
in
his
eagerness
to
carry
out
his
new
plans
he
grew
impatient
of
official
restraints
and
partly
from
this
reason
partly
on
account
of
his
ill
health
he
left
burgdorf
without
even
actually
becoming
father
of
the
orphans
after
a
sojourn
of
some
months
in
berlin
where
he
was
detained
through
family
affairs
but
used
the
opportunities
thus
afforded
of
examining
the
recently
founded
infant
schools
froebel
returned
to
keilhau
and
soon
afterwards
opened
the
first
or
of
children
in
the
neighbouring
village
of
blankenburg
not
only
the
thing
but
the
name
seemed
to
froebel
a
happy
inspiration
and
it
has
now
become
inseparably
connected
with
his
own
perhaps
we
can
hardly
understand
the
pleasure
he
took
in
it
unless
we
know
its
predecessor
firmly
convinced
of
the
importance
of
the
kindergarten
for
the
whole
human
race
froebel
described
his
system
in
a
weekly
paper
his
which
appeared
from
the
middle
of
till
he
also
lectured
in
great
towns
and
he
gave
a
regular
course
of
instruction
to
young
teachers
at
blankenburg
but
although
the
principles
of
the
kindergarten
were
gradually
making
their
way
the
first
kindergarten
was
failing
for
want
of
funds
it
had
to
be
given
up
and
froebel
now
a
widower
he
had
lost
his
wife
in
carried
on
his
course
for
teachers
first
at
keilhau
and
from
for
the
last
four
years
of
his
life
at
or
near
liebenstein
in
the
thuringian
forest
and
in
the
duchy
of
meiningen
it
is
in
these
last
years
that
the
man
froebel
will
be
best
known
to
posterity
for
in
be
attracted
within
the
circle
of
his
influence
a
woman
of
great
intellectual
power
the
baroness
von
who
has
given
us
in
her
of
friedrich
the
only
portrait
we
possess
in
these
records
of
personal
intercourse
we
see
the
truth
of
words
living
perception
of
universal
and
ideal
truth
which
his
talk
revealed
to
us
his
unbounded
enthusiasm
for
the
education
and
happiness
of
the
human
race
his
willingness
to
offer
up
everything
he
possessed
for
the
sake
of
his
idea
the
stream
of
thoughts
which
flowed
from
his
enthusiasm
for
the
ideal
as
from
an
inexhaustible
fountain
all
these
made
froebel
a
wonderful
appearance
in
the
world
by
whom
no
unprejudiced
spectator
could
fail
to
be
attracted
and
these
seemed
likely
to
be
most
peaceful
days
he
married
again
and
having
now
devoted
himself
to
the
training
of
women
as
educators
he
spent
his
time
in
instructing
his
class
of
young
female
teachers
but
trouble
came
upon
him
from
a
quarter
whence
he
least
expected
it
in
the
great
year
of
revolutions
froebel
had
hoped
to
turn
to
account
the
general
eagerness
for
improvement
and
middendorff
had
presented
an
address
on
kindergartens
to
the
german
parliament
besides
this
a
nephew
of
published
books
which
were
supposed
to
teach
socialism
true
the
uncle
and
nephew
differed
so
widely
that
new
were
the
enemies
of
the
but
the
distinction
was
overlooked
and
friedrich
and
karl
froebel
were
regarded
as
the
united
advocates
of
new
in
the
reaction
which
soon
set
in
froebel
found
himself
suspected
of
socialism
and
irreligion
and
in
the
raumer
issued
an
edict
forbidding
the
establishment
of
schools
friedrich
and
karl
in
prussia
it
was
in
vain
that
froebel
proved
that
his
principles
differed
fundamentally
from
his
it
was
in
vain
that
a
congress
of
schoolmasters
presided
over
by
the
celebrated
diesterweg
protested
against
the
calumnious
decree
the
minister
turned
a
deaf
ear
and
the
decree
remained
in
force
ten
years
after
the
death
of
froebel
till
but
the
edict
was
a
heavy
blow
to
the
old
man
who
looked
to
the
government
of
the
prussia
for
support
and
was
met
with
denunciation
of
the
justice
of
the
charge
brought
by
the
minister
against
froebel
the
reader
may
judge
from
the
account
of
his
principles
given
below
whether
from
the
worry
of
this
new
controversy
or
from
whatever
cause
froebel
did
not
long
survive
the
decree
his
seventieth
birthday
was
celebrated
with
great
rejoicings
in
may
but
he
died
in
the
following
month
and
lies
buried
at
schweina
a
village
near
his
last
abode
marienthal
throughout
these
essays
my
object
has
been
to
collect
what
seemed
to
me
the
most
valuable
lessons
of
various
reformers
in
doing
this
i
have
had
to
judge
and
decide
what
was
most
valuable
and
at
times
to
criticise
and
differ
from
my
authorities
this
may
perhaps
give
rise
to
the
question
do
you
then
think
yourself
the
superior
or
at
least
the
equal
of
the
great
men
you
criticise
and
i
could
only
reply
in
all
sincerity
i
most
certainly
do
not
if
i
am
asked
further
what
then
is
my
attitude
towards
them
i
reply
it
differs
very
much
with
different
individuals
i
can
not
say
i
am
prepared
to
sit
at
the
feet
of
mulcaster
or
dury
or
petty
in
writing
of
these
men
i
simply
point
out
very
early
expression
of
ideas
that
following
generations
have
developed
partially
and
we
are
developing
still
when
we
come
to
the
great
leaders
we
see
among
them
men
like
comenius
who
unite
a
thorough
study
of
what
has
already
been
thought
and
done
with
a
genius
for
original
thinking
men
like
locke
with
splendid
intellectual
gifts
and
a
power
of
happy
and
clear
expression
men
like
rousseau
with
a
talent
for
shaking
themselves
free
from
which
upon
us
with
a
weight
heavy
as
frost
and
deep
almost
as
life
and
besides
this
in
his
case
at
least
endowed
with
a
voice
to
be
heard
throughout
the
world
then
again
we
have
men
like
pestalozzi
who
with
a
genius
for
investigating
devote
their
lives
to
the
investigation
and
men
like
froebel
who
seem
to
penetrate
to
a
region
above
us
or
at
least
beyond
us
and
to
talk
about
it
in
language
which
at
times
only
partially
conveys
a
meaning
from
all
these
men
we
have
much
to
learn
and
that
we
may
do
this
we
must
come
as
learners
to
them
when
we
thus
come
we
find
that
the
great
lessons
they
teach
become
clearer
and
clearer
as
each
takes
up
wholly
or
in
part
what
has
been
taught
by
his
predecessors
and
adds
to
it
some
of
these
lessons
we
may
now
receive
as
established
truths
and
seek
to
conform
our
practice
to
them
but
in
following
our
leaders
we
dare
not
close
our
eyes
before
we
can
know
anything
we
must
see
it
as
locke
says
with
our
eye
the
great
thing
is
to
keep
the
eye
of
the
mind
wide
open
and
always
on
the
lookout
for
truth
acting
on
this
conviction
i
have
not
blindly
accepted
the
dicta
even
of
the
greatest
men
but
have
selected
those
of
their
lessons
which
are
taught
if
not
by
all
at
least
by
most
of
them
and
which
also
seem
to
evoke
spontaneous
spring
of
the
intelligence
towards
see
in
reading
froebel
however
i
am
conscious
that
this
is
wanting
before
one
can
accept
teaching
one
must
at
least
understand
it
and
this
preliminary
is
not
always
possible
when
we
would
learn
from
froebel
at
times
he
goes
entirely
out
of
sight
and
whether
the
words
we
hear
are
the
expression
of
deep
truth
or
have
absolutely
no
meaning
at
all
i
for
my
part
am
at
times
totally
unable
to
determine
but
where
i
can
understand
him
he
seems
to
me
singularly
wise
and
working
in
the
same
lines
as
pestalozzi
he
in
some
respects
advances
far
beyond
his
great
predecessor
both
these
men
were
devotees
of
science
but
instead
of
finding
in
science
anything
antagonistic
to
religion
they
looked
upon
science
as
the
expression
of
the
mind
of
god
their
belief
was
just
that
which
sir
thomas
browne
had
uttered
more
than
years
before
in
the
we
christen
effects
by
their
most
sensible
and
nearest
causes
yet
is
god
the
true
and
infallible
cause
of
all
whose
concourse
concurrence
though
it
be
general
yet
doth
it
subdivide
itself
into
the
particular
actions
of
everything
and
is
that
spirit
by
which
each
singular
essence
not
only
subsists
but
performs
its
with
this
belief
froebel
sought
to
trace
everything
back
to
the
central
unity
to
god
the
author
of
the
imitatione
has
said
man
to
whom
all
things
are
one
who
refers
all
things
to
one
and
sees
all
things
in
one
he
can
stand
firm
and
be
at
peace
in
god
cui
omnia
unum
sunt
et
qui
omnia
ad
unum
trahit
et
omnia
in
uno
videt
potest
stabilis
esse
et
in
deo
pacificus
im
lib
i
cap
so
thought
froebel
and
his
great
longing
was
to
refer
all
things
to
one
and
see
all
things
in
one
however
little
we
may
share
this
longing
we
must
admit
that
it
is
a
natural
outcome
from
the
christian
religion
if
there
is
one
in
whom
all
and
move
and
have
their
being
everything
should
be
referred
to
him
as
froebel
says
allem
wirkt
und
schafft
leben
weil
das
leben
ein
gott
gegeben
in
everything
there
works
and
stirs
life
because
to
all
one
god
has
given
life
so
long
then
as
we
remain
christians
we
must
agree
with
froebel
that
all
true
education
is
founded
on
religion
perhaps
in
the
end
we
may
adopt
his
high
ideal
and
say
with
him
should
lead
and
guide
man
to
clearness
concerning
himself
and
in
himself
to
peace
with
nature
and
to
unity
with
god
hence
it
should
lift
him
to
a
knowledge
of
himself
and
of
mankind
to
a
knowledge
of
god
and
of
nature
and
to
the
pure
and
holy
life
to
which
such
knowledge
of
object
of
education
is
the
realization
of
a
faithful
pure
inviolate
and
hence
holy
this
is
indeed
a
high
ideal
and
we
naturally
ask
if
we
would
work
towards
it
what
road
would
froebel
point
out
to
us
this
brings
us
to
his
theory
of
development
or
as
it
has
been
called
since
darwin
evolution
the
idea
of
organic
growth
was
first
definitely
applied
to
the
young
by
pestalozzi
but
it
was
more
clearly
and
consistently
applied
by
froebel
it
has
gone
forth
conquering
and
to
conquer
and
though
far
indeed
from
being
accepted
by
the
teaching
profession
of
this
age
it
is
likely
to
have
a
vast
influence
on
the
practice
of
those
who
will
come
after
them
i
therefore
give
the
following
statement
of
it
which
seems
to
me
excellent
first
thing
to
note
in
the
idea
of
development
is
that
it
indicates
not
an
increase
in
bulk
or
quantity
though
it
may
include
this
but
an
increase
in
complexity
of
structure
an
improvement
in
power
skill
and
variety
in
the
performance
of
natural
functions
we
say
that
a
thing
is
fully
developed
when
its
internal
organisation
is
perfect
in
every
detail
and
when
it
can
perform
all
its
natural
actions
or
functions
perfectly
if
we
apply
this
distinction
to
mind
an
increase
in
bulk
will
be
represented
by
an
increase
in
the
amount
of
material
retained
in
the
mind
in
the
memory
development
will
be
a
perfecting
of
the
structure
of
the
mind
itself
an
increase
of
power
and
skill
and
variety
in
dealing
with
knowledge
and
in
putting
knowledge
to
all
its
natural
uses
the
next
thing
to
consider
is
how
this
development
is
produced
how
can
we
aid
in
promoting
this
change
from
germ
to
complete
organism
from
partially
developed
thing
to
more
highly
developed
thing
the
answer
comes
from
every
part
of
creation
with
clearness
and
is
produced
by
exercise
of
function
use
of
faculty
neglect
or
disuse
of
any
part
of
an
organism
leads
to
the
dwindling
and
sometimes
even
to
the
disappearance
of
that
part
and
this
applies
not
only
to
individuals
but
stretches
also
from
parent
to
child
from
generation
to
generation
constituting
then
what
we
call
heredity
or
what
froebel
calls
the
connectedness
of
humanity
slowly
through
successive
generations
a
faculty
or
organ
may
dwindle
and
decay
or
may
be
brought
to
greater
and
greater
perfection
as
froebel
puts
it
humanity
past
present
and
future
is
one
continuous
whole
the
of
development
then
possible
in
any
particular
case
plainly
depends
partly
on
the
original
outfit
and
partly
and
as
a
rule
in
a
greater
measure
on
the
opportunities
there
have
been
for
exercise
and
the
use
made
of
those
opportunities
if
we
wish
to
develop
the
hand
we
must
exercise
the
hand
if
we
wish
to
develop
the
body
we
must
exercise
the
body
if
we
wish
to
develop
the
mind
we
must
exercise
the
mind
if
we
wish
to
develop
the
human
being
we
must
the
human
being
but
will
exercise
suffice
again
the
answer
is
clear
only
that
exercise
which
is
always
in
harmony
with
the
nature
of
the
thing
and
which
is
always
proportioned
to
the
strength
of
the
thing
produces
true
development
all
other
exercise
is
partially
or
wholly
hurtful
and
another
condition
evident
in
every
case
becomes
still
more
evident
when
we
apply
these
laws
to
the
mind
to
produce
development
most
truly
and
effectively
the
exercise
must
arise
from
and
be
sustained
by
the
own
own
natural
powers
and
all
of
them
as
far
as
these
are
in
sense
connected
with
the
activity
proposed
should
be
awakened
and
become
naturally
active
if
for
instance
we
desire
to
further
the
development
of
a
plant
what
we
have
to
do
is
to
induce
the
plant
and
the
whole
of
it
to
become
active
in
its
own
natural
way
and
to
help
it
to
sustain
that
activity
we
may
abridge
the
time
we
may
modify
the
result
but
we
must
act
through
and
by
the
own
activity
this
activity
of
a
own
self
we
call
of
we
generally
consider
the
mind
in
the
light
of
its
three
activities
of
feeling
and
the
exercise
which
aims
at
producing
mental
development
must
be
in
harmony
with
the
nature
of
and
and
continually
in
proportion
to
their
strength
and
further
it
is
found
that
the
more
the
activity
is
that
of
the
mind
the
more
it
is
the
and
and
better
is
the
result
in
other
words
knowing
feeling
and
willing
must
take
their
rightful
share
in
the
exercise
and
in
particular
feeling
and
powers
of
prompting
and
nourishing
of
maintaining
and
directing
its
own
never
be
bowen
on
of
divine
message
or
eternal
regulation
of
the
universe
there
verily
is
in
regard
to
every
conceivable
procedure
and
affair
of
man
faithfully
following
this
said
procedure
or
affair
will
prosper
not
following
this
destruction
and
wreck
are
certain
for
every
these
words
of
express
thought
about
education
before
attempting
to
educate
we
must
do
all
we
can
to
ascertain
the
divine
message
and
must
then
direct
our
proceedings
by
it
the
divine
message
must
be
learnt
according
to
froebel
by
studying
the
nature
of
the
organism
we
have
to
assist
in
developing
each
human
being
must
from
within
and
free
in
accordance
with
the
eternal
law
this
is
the
problem
and
the
aim
of
all
education
in
instruction
and
training
there
can
be
and
should
be
no
of
for
has
come
forth
from
the
divine
from
god
and
is
through
god
alone
conditioned
to
this
it
is
that
all
things
owe
their
the
divine
working
in
them
the
divine
element
that
works
in
each
thing
is
the
true
idea
of
the
therefore
destiny
and
calling
of
all
things
is
to
develop
their
true
idea
and
in
so
doing
to
reveal
god
in
outward
and
through
passing
what
we
must
think
of
then
is
the
which
each
child
should
develop
how
is
this
idea
to
be
ascertained
in
other
words
how
are
we
to
learn
the
divine
message
about
the
bringing
up
of
children
this
message
is
given
us
through
the
works
of
god
the
creation
in
nature
and
the
order
of
the
material
world
and
in
the
progress
of
mankind
god
has
given
us
the
true
type
of
so
froebel
would
have
all
educators
lay
to
heart
the
great
principle
of
the
baconian
philosophy
we
command
nature
only
by
obeying
her
they
are
to
be
very
cautious
how
they
interfere
and
the
education
they
give
is
to
be
even
in
teaching
they
must
bear
in
mind
that
purpose
of
teaching
is
to
bring
ever
more
man
rather
than
to
put
more
and
more
of
froebel
in
fact
taught
the
pestalozzian
doctrine
that
the
function
of
the
educator
was
that
of
but
if
froebel
would
thus
limit
the
action
of
the
educator
he
would
greatly
extend
the
action
of
those
educated
and
here
we
see
the
great
principle
with
which
the
name
of
froebel
is
likely
to
be
permanently
associated
of
all
that
appears
of
all
that
exists
and
therefore
of
all
intellectual
conception
is
act
action
from
the
act
from
action
must
therefore
start
true
human
education
the
developing
education
of
the
man
in
action
in
acting
it
must
be
rooted
and
must
spring
up
living
acting
conceiving
must
form
a
triple
chord
within
every
child
of
man
though
the
sound
now
of
this
string
now
of
that
may
preponderate
and
then
again
of
two
many
thinkers
before
froebel
had
seen
the
transcendent
importance
of
action
but
froebel
not
only
based
everything
upon
it
but
he
based
it
upon
god
creates
and
works
productively
in
uninterrupted
continuity
each
thought
of
god
is
a
work
a
of
as
jesus
has
said
father
worketh
hitherto
and
i
john
v
from
this
it
follows
that
since
god
created
man
in
his
own
image
should
create
and
bring
forth
like
of
who
will
early
learn
to
recognise
the
creator
must
early
exercise
his
own
power
of
action
with
the
consciousness
that
he
is
bringing
about
what
is
good
for
the
doing
good
is
the
link
between
the
creature
and
the
creator
and
the
conscious
doing
of
it
the
conscious
connexion
the
true
living
union
of
the
man
with
god
of
the
individual
man
as
of
the
human
race
and
is
therefore
at
once
the
starting
point
and
the
eternal
aim
of
all
elsewhere
he
says
become
truly
in
diligence
and
industry
in
working
and
doing
which
are
accompanied
by
the
clear
perception
or
even
by
the
vaguest
feeling
that
thereby
we
represent
the
inner
in
the
outer
that
we
give
body
to
spirit
and
form
to
thought
that
we
render
visible
the
invisible
that
we
impart
an
outward
finite
transient
being
to
life
in
the
spirit
through
this
we
rise
more
and
more
to
a
true
knowledge
of
god
to
insight
into
his
spirit
and
thus
inwardly
and
outwardly
god
comes
ever
nearer
to
us
therefore
jesus
says
of
the
poor
is
the
kingdom
of
heaven
if
they
could
but
see
and
know
it
and
practice
it
in
diligence
and
industry
in
productive
and
creative
work
of
children
too
is
the
kingdom
of
heaven
for
unchecked
by
the
presumption
and
conceit
of
adults
they
yield
themselves
in
trust
and
cheerfulness
to
their
formative
and
creative
of
this
and
creative
which
as
we
must
suppose
has
existed
in
all
children
in
all
nations
and
in
all
ages
of
the
world
froebel
was
the
first
to
take
duly
into
account
for
education
pestalozzi
saw
the
importance
of
getting
children
to
and
to
think
about
their
material
surroundings
these
the
child
can
observe
and
search
into
and
in
doing
this
he
may
discover
what
is
not
at
first
obvious
to
sight
or
touch
and
may
even
ascertain
relations
between
the
several
parts
of
the
same
thing
or
connexions
between
different
things
compared
together
all
these
discoveries
may
be
made
by
the
but
only
on
one
condition
viz
that
the
child
is
interested
but
in
the
search
interest
soon
flags
and
then
observation
comes
to
an
end
besides
even
while
it
lasts
in
full
vigour
the
activity
is
mental
only
it
is
concerned
with
perceiving
taking
in
and
for
development
something
more
is
needed
the
organism
must
not
only
take
in
it
must
also
and
so
we
find
in
children
a
restless
eagerness
to
touch
pull
about
and
change
the
condition
of
things
around
them
when
this
activity
of
theirs
instead
of
being
checked
is
properly
directed
the
children
are
delighted
in
recognising
desirable
results
which
they
themselves
have
brought
about
especially
those
which
give
expression
to
what
is
their
own
thought
in
this
way
the
child
the
inner
outer
and
in
thus
satisfying
his
creative
instinct
he
is
led
to
exercise
some
faculties
both
of
mind
and
body
the
prominence
which
froebel
gave
to
action
his
doctrine
that
man
is
primarily
a
doer
and
even
a
creator
and
that
he
learns
only
through
may
produce
great
changes
in
educational
methods
generally
and
not
simply
in
the
treatment
of
children
too
young
for
schooling
but
it
was
to
the
first
stage
of
life
that
froebel
paid
the
greatest
attention
and
it
is
over
this
stage
that
his
influence
is
gradually
extending
froebel
held
that
each
age
has
a
completeness
of
its
own
the
blade
then
the
ear
then
the
full
corn
in
the
and
that
the
perfection
of
the
later
stage
can
be
attained
only
through
the
perfection
of
the
earlier
if
the
infant
is
what
he
should
be
as
an
infant
and
the
child
as
a
child
he
will
become
what
he
should
be
as
a
boy
just
as
naturally
as
new
shoots
spring
from
the
healthy
plant
every
stage
then
must
be
cared
for
and
tended
in
such
a
way
that
it
may
attain
its
own
perfection
but
as
bacon
says
with
reference
to
education
the
gardener
bestows
most
care
on
the
young
plants
and
it
was
young
for
whom
froebel
designed
his
kindergarten
like
pestalozzi
he
attached
the
very
highest
importance
to
giving
instruction
to
mothers
but
he
would
not
like
pestalozzi
leave
young
children
entirely
in
the
hands
there
was
something
to
be
done
for
them
which
even
the
ideal
mother
in
the
ideal
family
could
not
do
pestalozzi
held
that
the
child
belonged
to
the
family
fichte
on
the
other
hand
claimed
it
for
society
and
the
state
froebel
whose
mind
like
that
of
our
own
theologian
frederick
maurice
delighted
in
harmonising
apparent
contradictions
and
who
taught
that
progress
lay
through
opposites
to
their
reconciliation
maintained
that
the
child
belongs
both
to
the
family
and
to
society
and
he
would
therefore
have
children
prepare
for
society
by
spending
some
hours
of
the
day
in
a
common
life
and
in
common
employments
his
study
of
children
showed
him
that
one
of
their
most
striking
characteristics
was
restlessness
this
was
first
restlessness
of
body
delight
in
mere
motion
of
the
limbs
and
secondly
restlessness
of
mind
a
constant
curiosity
about
whatever
came
within
the
range
of
the
senses
and
especially
a
desire
to
examine
with
the
hand
every
unknown
object
within
reach
fondness
for
using
their
hands
was
especially
noted
by
froebel
and
he
found
that
they
delighted
not
merely
in
examining
by
touch
but
also
in
altering
whatever
they
could
alter
and
further
that
they
endeavoured
to
imitate
known
forms
whether
by
drawing
or
whenever
they
could
get
any
kind
of
plastic
material
by
modelling
besides
remarking
in
them
these
various
activities
he
saw
that
children
were
sociable
and
needed
the
sympathy
of
companions
there
was
too
in
them
a
growing
moral
nature
passions
affections
and
conscience
which
needed
to
be
controlled
responded
to
cultivated
both
the
restraints
and
the
opportunities
incident
to
a
community
would
be
beneficial
to
their
moral
nature
and
prove
a
cure
for
selfishness
as
all
education
was
to
be
sought
in
rightly
directed
but
spontaneous
action
froebel
considered
how
the
children
in
this
community
should
be
employed
at
that
age
their
most
natural
employment
is
play
especially
as
wordsworth
has
pointed
out
games
in
which
they
imitate
and
the
they
themselves
will
have
to
fill
in
after
years
froebel
agreed
with
montaigne
that
the
games
of
children
were
most
serious
occupations
and
with
locke
that
the
plays
and
diversions
of
children
should
be
directed
towards
good
and
useful
habits
or
else
they
will
introduce
ill
so
he
invented
a
course
of
occupations
a
great
part
of
which
consisted
in
social
games
many
of
the
names
are
connected
with
the
as
he
called
the
series
of
simple
playthings
provided
for
the
children
the
first
being
the
ball
type
of
the
are
chiefly
not
mere
playthings
but
materials
which
the
children
work
up
in
their
own
way
thus
gaining
scope
for
their
power
of
doing
and
inventing
and
creating
the
artistic
faculty
was
much
thought
of
by
froebel
and
as
in
the
education
of
the
ancients
the
sense
of
rhythm
in
sound
and
motion
was
cultivated
by
music
and
poetry
introduced
in
the
games
much
care
was
to
be
given
to
the
training
of
the
senses
especially
those
of
sight
sound
and
touch
intuition
was
to
be
recognised
as
the
true
basis
of
knowledge
and
though
stories
were
to
be
told
and
there
was
to
be
much
intercourse
in
the
way
of
social
chat
instruction
of
the
imparting
and
kind
was
to
be
excluded
there
was
to
be
no
knowledge
in
fact
froebel
like
pestalozzi
endeavoured
to
do
for
the
child
what
bacon
nearly
years
before
had
done
for
the
philosopher
bacon
showed
the
philosopher
that
the
way
to
study
nature
was
not
to
learn
what
others
had
surmised
but
to
go
straight
to
nature
and
use
his
own
senses
and
his
own
powers
of
observation
pestalozzi
and
froebel
wished
children
to
learn
in
this
way
as
well
as
philosophers
schools
for
very
young
children
existed
before
kindergarten
but
they
had
been
thought
of
more
in
the
interest
of
the
mothers
than
of
the
children
it
was
for
the
sake
of
the
mothers
that
oberlin
established
them
in
the
vosges
more
than
a
century
ago
his
first
de
being
peasant
women
sara
banzet
and
louise
scheppler
in
the
early
part
of
this
century
the
notion
was
taken
up
by
james
buchanan
and
samuel
wilderspin
in
this
country
see
james
and
by
cochin
in
france
but
conception
differed
from
that
of
the
his
object
was
purely
educational
but
he
would
have
no
he
called
these
communities
of
children
gardens
of
children
enclosures
in
which
young
human
plants
are
nurtured
the
employment
is
to
be
play
but
any
occupation
in
which
children
delight
is
to
them
and
series
of
employments
while
they
are
in
this
sense
play
to
the
children
have
nevertheless
as
seen
from
the
adult
point
of
view
a
distinctly
educational
object
this
object
as
froebel
himself
describes
it
is
give
the
children
employment
in
agreement
with
their
whole
nature
to
strengthen
their
bodies
to
exercise
their
senses
to
engage
their
awakening
mind
and
through
their
senses
to
bring
them
acquainted
with
nature
and
their
it
is
especially
to
guide
aright
the
heart
and
the
affections
and
to
lead
them
to
the
original
ground
of
all
life
to
unity
with
no
less
than
years
ago
henry
barnard
in
his
report
to
governor
of
connecticut
declared
the
kindergarten
to
be
far
the
most
original
attractive
and
philosophical
form
of
infant
development
the
world
has
yet
since
then
it
has
spread
in
all
civilised
lands
and
in
many
of
them
there
are
now
kindergartens
the
first
i
believe
having
been
established
in
by
william
harris
in
louis
mo
but
ideas
are
not
so
easily
got
hold
of
as
his
and
the
real
extension
of
his
system
may
be
by
no
means
so
great
as
it
seems
kindergarten
system
in
the
hands
of
one
who
understands
it
says
james
ward
admirable
results
but
it
is
apt
to
be
too
mechanical
and
formal
there
does
not
seem
room
for
the
individuality
of
a
child
to
which
all
free
play
possible
should
be
given
in
the
earliest
in
ap
and
courthope
bowen
has
well
said
work
without
the
kindergarten
idea
like
a
body
without
a
soul
is
subject
to
rapid
degeneration
and
so
perhaps
it
will
in
the
end
prove
that
froebel
in
his
of
which
is
book
with
seven
has
left
us
a
more
precious
legacy
than
in
his
and
occupations
which
are
so
popular
and
so
easily
adopted
it
has
been
well
said
that
essence
of
stupidity
is
in
the
demand
for
final
how
our
thoughts
have
widened
about
education
since
a
man
like
johnson
could
assert
is
as
well
known
and
has
long
been
as
well
known
as
ever
it
can
be
ij
the
astronomers
of
the
middle
ages
might
as
well
have
asserted
that
nothing
more
could
ever
be
known
about
astronomy
was
froebel
what
he
believed
himself
to
be
the
kepler
or
the
newton
of
the
educational
system
whoso
is
wise
will
not
during
the
nineteenth
century
lay
claim
to
a
on
this
point
but
the
seems
gaining
ground
parker
emphatically
declares
by
which
he
probably
means
encouragement
of
to
be
most
important
educational
reform
of
the
nineteenth
we
sometimes
see
it
questioned
whether
the
has
any
proper
claim
to
its
title
but
the
education
which
johnson
considered
final
and
which
seems
to
us
old
aimed
at
learning
and
the
education
which
aims
not
at
learning
but
at
developing
through
is
so
different
from
this
that
it
may
well
be
called
new
if
we
consider
the
platform
of
the
new
educationists
as
it
stands
in
the
new
york
we
shall
find
that
if
it
is
not
all
new
in
theory
it
would
be
substantially
new
in
practice
let
us
look
at
a
brief
statement
of
what
the
requires
each
study
must
be
valued
in
proportion
as
it
develops
and
power
is
developed
by
the
memory
must
be
employed
in
strict
subservience
to
the
higher
faculties
of
the
mind
whatever
instruction
is
given
it
must
be
adapted
to
the
actual
state
of
the
pupil
and
not
ruled
by
the
wants
of
the
future
boy
or
man
more
time
must
be
given
to
the
study
of
nature
and
to
modern
language
and
literature
less
to
the
ancient
languages
the
body
must
be
educated
as
well
as
the
mind
rich
and
poor
alike
must
be
taught
to
use
their
eyes
and
hands
the
higher
education
of
women
must
be
cared
for
no
less
than
that
of
men
teachers
no
less
than
doctors
must
go
through
a
course
of
professional
training
to
these
there
must
in
time
be
added
another
all
methods
shall
have
a
scientific
foundation
they
shall
be
based
on
the
laws
of
the
mind
or
shall
have
been
tested
by
those
laws
when
this
program
is
adopted
even
as
the
object
of
our
efforts
we
shall
indeed
have
a
new
education
at
present
the
encouragement
of
is
thought
of
if
at
all
only
as
a
of
our
school
work
is
chiefly
mechanical
and
will
long
remain
so
the
primary
school
to
the
college
productive
creative
doing
is
almost
wholly
excluded
knowledge
in
its
barrenest
form
is
communicated
and
tested
in
the
barrenest
wordiest
way
possible
never
is
the
learner
taught
or
permitted
to
apply
his
knowledge
to
even
so
inveterate
is
the
habit
of
the
school
that
the
kindergarten
itself
although
invented
by
the
and
froebel
for
the
very
purpose
of
correcting
this
fault
has
in
most
cases
fallen
a
victim
to
its
so
says
hailmann
may
and
those
who
best
know
what
usually
goes
on
in
the
are
the
least
likely
to
differ
from
him
during
the
last
thirty
years
i
have
spent
the
greatest
part
of
my
working
hours
in
a
variety
of
and
if
my
school
experience
has
shown
me
that
our
advance
is
slow
my
study
of
the
reformers
convinces
me
that
it
is
sure
out
the
old
ring
in
the
new
it
has
been
well
said
that
to
study
science
is
to
study
the
thoughts
of
god
and
thus
it
is
that
all
true
educational
reformers
declare
the
thoughts
of
god
to
us
divine
message
of
eternal
regulation
of
the
universe
there
verily
is
in
regard
to
every
conceivable
procedure
and
affair
of
man
and
it
behoves
us
to
ascertain
what
that
message
is
in
regard
to
the
immensely
important
procedure
and
affair
of
bringing
up
children
after
innumerable
mistakes
we
seem
by
degrees
to
be
getting
some
notion
of
it
and
such
insight
as
we
have
we
owe
to
those
who
have
contributed
to
the
science
of
education
among
these
there
are
probably
no
greater
names
than

jacotot
a
methodizer
we
are
now
by
degrees
becoming
convinced
that
teachers
like
everyone
else
who
undertakes
skilled
labour
should
be
trained
before
they
seek
an
engagement
this
has
led
to
a
great
increase
in
the
number
of
normal
schools
in
some
of
these
schools
it
has
already
been
discovered
that
while
the
study
of
principles
requires
much
time
and
the
application
of
much
intellectual
force
the
study
of
methods
is
a
far
simpler
matter
and
can
be
knocked
off
in
a
short
time
and
with
no
intellectual
force
at
all
methods
are
special
ways
of
doing
things
and
when
it
has
been
settled
what
is
to
be
done
and
why
a
knowledge
of
the
methods
available
adds
greatly
to
a
power
but
the
what
and
the
why
demand
our
attention
before
the
how
and
the
study
of
methods
disconnected
from
principles
leads
straight
to
the
of
all
the
higher
i
have
called
jacotot
a
methodizer
because
he
invented
a
special
method
and
wished
everything
to
be
taught
by
it
but
in
advocating
this
method
he
appeals
to
principles
and
his
principles
are
so
important
that
at
least
one
man
great
in
educational
science
joseph
payne
always
spoke
of
him
as
his
master
in
the
following
summary
of
system
i
am
largely
indebted
to
joseph
lectures
which
he
published
in
the
in
and
which
i
believe
payne
has
lately
reprinted
in
a
volume
of
his
collected
papers
jacotot
was
born
at
dijon
of
humble
parentage
in
even
as
a
boy
he
showed
his
preference
for
we
are
told
that
he
rejoiced
greatly
in
the
acquisition
of
all
kinds
of
knowledge
that
could
be
gained
by
his
own
efforts
while
he
steadily
resisted
what
was
imposed
on
him
by
authority
he
was
however
early
distinguished
by
his
acquirements
and
at
the
age
of
was
appointed
of
the
polytechnic
school
some
years
afterwards
he
became
professor
of
method
of
at
dijon
and
it
was
here
that
his
method
of
instruction
first
attracted
attention
of
pouring
forth
a
flood
of
information
on
the
subject
under
attention
from
his
own
ample
everything
and
thus
too
frequently
superseding
in
a
great
degree
the
own
investigation
of
after
a
simple
statement
of
the
subject
with
its
leading
divisions
boldly
started
it
as
a
quarry
for
the
class
to
hunt
down
and
invited
every
member
of
it
to
take
part
in
the
all
were
free
to
ask
questions
to
raise
objections
to
suggest
answers
the
professor
himself
did
little
more
than
by
leading
questions
put
them
on
the
right
scent
he
was
afterwards
professor
of
ancient
and
oriental
languages
of
mathematics
and
of
roman
law
and
he
pursued
the
same
method
we
are
told
with
uniform
success
being
compelled
to
leave
france
as
an
enemy
of
the
bourbons
he
was
appointed
in
when
he
was
years
old
to
the
professorship
of
the
french
language
and
literature
at
the
university
of
louvain
the
celebrated
teacher
was
received
with
enthusiasm
but
he
soon
met
with
an
unexpected
difficulty
many
members
of
his
large
class
knew
no
language
but
the
flemish
and
dutch
and
of
these
he
himself
was
totally
ignorant
he
was
therefore
forced
to
consider
how
to
teach
without
talking
to
his
pupils
the
plan
he
adopted
was
as
follows
gave
the
young
flemings
copies
of
with
the
french
on
one
side
and
a
dutch
translation
on
the
other
this
they
had
to
study
for
themselves
comparing
the
two
languages
and
learning
the
french
by
heart
they
were
to
go
over
the
same
ground
again
and
again
and
as
soon
as
possible
they
were
to
give
in
french
however
bad
the
substance
of
those
parts
which
they
had
not
yet
committed
to
memory
this
method
was
found
to
succeed
marvellously
jacotot
attributed
its
success
to
the
fact
that
the
students
had
learnt
by
the
efforts
of
their
own
and
that
though
working
under
his
superintendence
they
had
been
in
fact
their
own
teachers
hence
he
proceeded
to
generalise
and
by
degrees
arrived
at
a
series
of
astounding
paradoxes
these
paradoxes
at
first
did
their
work
well
and
made
noise
enough
in
the
world
but
jacotot
seems
to
me
like
a
captain
who
in
his
eagerness
to
astonish
his
opponents
takes
on
board
guns
much
too
heavy
for
his
own
safety
human
beings
are
equally
capable
of
said
jacotot
the
truth
which
jacotot
chose
to
throw
into
this
more
than
doubtful
form
may
perhaps
be
expressed
by
saying
that
the
power
of
learning
depends
in
a
great
measure
on
his
and
that
where
there
is
no
will
there
is
no
capacity
can
teach
and
moreover
can
teach
that
which
he
does
not
know
let
us
ask
ourselves
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
first
of
all
we
have
to
get
rid
of
some
ambiguity
in
the
meaning
of
the
word
to
teach
according
to
idea
is
to
cause
to
learn
teaching
and
learning
are
therefore
correlatives
where
there
is
no
learning
there
can
be
no
teaching
but
this
meaning
of
the
word
only
coincides
partially
with
the
ordinary
meaning
we
speak
of
the
lecturer
or
preacher
as
teaching
when
he
gives
his
hearers
an
opportunity
of
learning
and
do
not
say
that
his
teaching
ceases
the
instant
they
cease
to
attend
on
the
other
hand
we
do
not
call
a
parent
a
teacher
because
he
sends
his
boy
to
school
and
so
causes
him
to
learn
the
notion
of
teaching
then
in
the
minds
of
most
of
us
includes
giving
information
or
showing
how
an
art
is
to
be
performed
and
we
look
upon
assertion
as
absurd
because
we
feel
that
no
one
can
give
information
which
he
does
not
possess
or
show
how
anything
is
to
be
done
if
he
does
not
himself
know
but
let
us
take
the
jacototian
definition
of
to
then
see
how
far
a
person
can
cause
another
to
learn
that
of
which
he
himself
is
ignorant
subjects
which
are
may
be
divided
into
three
great
classes
facts
reasonings
or
generalisation
from
facts
science
actions
which
have
to
be
performed
by
the
learner
arts
we
learn
some
facts
by
by
direct
experience
it
may
be
as
well
to
make
the
number
of
them
as
large
as
possible
no
doubt
there
are
no
facts
which
are
so
perfectly
as
these
for
instance
a
boy
who
has
tried
to
smoke
knows
the
fact
that
tobacco
is
apt
to
produce
nausea
much
better
than
another
who
has
picked
up
the
information
an
intelligent
master
may
suggest
experiments
even
in
matters
about
which
he
himself
is
ignorant
and
thus
in
sense
he
teaches
things
which
he
does
not
know
but
some
facts
can
not
be
learnt
in
this
way
and
then
a
newton
is
helpless
either
to
find
them
out
for
himself
or
to
teach
them
to
others
without
knowing
them
if
the
teacher
does
not
know
in
what
county
tavistock
is
he
can
only
learn
from
those
who
do
and
the
pupils
will
be
no
cleverer
than
their
master
here
then
i
consider
that
pretensions
utterly
break
down
the
answer
is
teacher
may
give
his
pupil
an
atlas
and
direct
the
boy
to
find
out
for
himself
thus
the
master
will
teach
what
he
does
not
but
in
this
case
he
is
a
teacher
only
so
far
as
he
knows
for
what
he
does
not
know
he
hands
over
the
pupil
to
the
maker
of
the
map
who
communicates
with
him
not
orally
but
by
ink
and
paper
the
ignorance
is
simply
an
obstacle
to
the
learning
for
the
boy
would
learn
sooner
the
position
of
tavistock
if
it
were
shown
him
on
the
map
the
very
point
says
the
disciple
of
jacotot
the
boy
gets
the
knowledge
without
any
trouble
he
is
likely
to
forget
it
again
directly
come
lightly
moreover
his
faculty
of
observation
will
not
have
been
it
is
indeed
well
not
to
allow
the
knowledge
even
of
facts
to
come
too
easily
though
the
difficulties
which
arise
from
the
ignorance
will
not
be
found
the
most
advantageous
still
there
is
obviously
a
limit
if
we
gave
boys
their
lessons
in
cipher
and
offered
a
prize
to
the
first
decipherer
one
would
probably
be
found
at
last
and
meantime
all
the
powers
of
observation
would
have
been
cultivated
by
comparing
like
signs
in
different
positions
and
guessing
at
their
meaning
but
the
time
might
have
been
better
employed
plan
of
teaching
a
language
which
the
master
did
not
know
was
to
put
a
book
with
say
virumque
cano
on
one
side
and
sing
arms
and
the
man
on
the
other
and
to
require
the
pupil
to
puzzle
over
it
till
he
found
out
which
word
answered
to
which
in
this
case
the
teacher
was
the
translator
and
though
from
the
roundabout
way
in
which
the
knowledge
was
communicated
the
pupil
derived
some
benefit
the
benefit
was
hardly
sufficient
to
make
up
for
the
expenditure
of
time
involved
jacotot
then
did
not
teach
facts
of
which
he
was
ignorant
except
in
the
sense
in
which
the
parent
who
sends
his
boy
to
school
may
be
said
to
teach
him
all
jacotot
did
was
to
direct
the
pupil
to
learn
sometimes
in
a
very
awkward
fashion
from
somebody
else
when
we
come
to
science
we
find
all
the
best
authorities
agree
that
the
pupil
should
be
led
to
principles
if
possible
and
not
have
the
principles
brought
to
him
men
like
tyndall
huxley
spencer
wilson
have
spoken
eloquently
on
this
subject
and
shown
how
valuable
scientific
teaching
is
when
thus
conducted
in
drawing
out
the
faculties
of
the
mind
but
although
a
schoolboy
may
be
led
to
great
scientific
discoveries
by
anyone
who
knows
the
road
he
will
have
no
more
chance
of
making
them
with
an
ignorant
teacher
than
he
would
have
had
in
the
days
of
the
ptolemies
here
again
then
i
can
not
understand
how
the
teacher
can
teach
what
he
does
not
know
he
may
indeed
join
his
pupil
in
investigating
principles
but
he
must
either
keep
with
the
pupil
or
go
in
advance
of
him
in
the
first
case
he
is
only
a
in
the
second
he
teaches
only
that
which
he
knows
finally
we
come
to
arts
and
we
are
told
that
jacotot
taught
drawing
and
music
without
being
either
a
draughtsman
or
a
musician
in
art
everything
depends
on
directed
the
most
consummate
artist
can
not
communicate
his
skill
and
except
for
inspiration
may
be
inferior
as
a
teacher
to
one
whose
attention
is
more
concentrated
on
the
mechanism
of
the
art
perhaps
it
is
not
even
necessary
that
the
teacher
should
be
able
to
do
the
exercises
himself
if
only
he
knows
how
they
should
be
done
but
he
seldom
gets
credit
for
this
knowledge
unless
he
can
show
that
he
knows
how
the
thing
should
be
done
by
doing
it
lessing
tells
us
that
raphael
would
have
been
a
great
painter
even
if
he
had
been
born
without
hands
he
would
not
however
have
succeeded
in
getting
mankind
to
believe
it
i
grant
then
that
the
teacher
of
art
need
not
be
a
artist
and
in
some
very
exceptional
cases
need
not
be
an
artist
at
all
but
if
he
can
not
perform
the
exercises
he
gives
his
pupil
he
must
at
least
how
they
should
be
but
jacotot
claims
perfect
ignorance
we
are
told
that
he
drawing
by
setting
objects
before
his
pupils
and
making
them
imitate
them
on
paper
as
best
they
could
of
course
the
art
originated
in
this
way
and
a
person
with
great
perseverance
and
i
must
say
in
spite
of
jacotot
with
more
than
average
ability
would
make
considerable
progress
with
no
proper
instruction
but
he
would
lose
much
by
the
ignorance
of
the
person
calling
himself
his
teacher
an
awkward
habit
of
holding
the
pencil
will
make
skill
doubly
difficult
to
acquire
and
thus
half
his
time
might
be
wasted
then
again
he
would
hardly
have
a
better
eye
than
the
early
painters
so
the
drawing
of
his
landscape
would
not
be
less
faulty
than
theirs
to
consider
music
i
am
told
that
a
person
who
is
ignorant
of
music
can
teach
say
the
piano
or
the
violin
this
seems
to
go
beyond
the
region
of
paradox
into
that
of
utter
nonsense
talent
often
surmounts
all
kinds
of
difficulties
but
in
the
case
of
and
musicians
it
is
often
painful
to
see
what
time
and
talent
have
been
wasted
for
want
of
proper
instruction
i
have
thus
carefully
examined
pretensions
to
teach
what
he
did
not
know
because
i
am
anxious
that
what
seems
to
me
the
rubbish
should
be
cleared
away
from
his
principles
and
should
no
longer
conceal
those
parts
of
his
system
which
are
worthy
of
general
attention
at
the
root
of
paradox
lay
a
truth
of
very
great
importance
the
highest
and
best
teaching
is
not
that
which
makes
the
pupils
passive
recipients
of
other
ideas
not
to
speak
of
the
teaching
which
conveys
mere
words
without
any
ideas
at
all
but
that
which
guides
and
encourages
the
pupils
in
working
for
themselves
and
thinking
for
themselves
the
master
as
joseph
payne
well
says
can
no
more
think
or
practise
or
see
for
his
pupil
than
he
can
digest
for
him
or
walk
for
him
the
pupil
must
owe
everything
to
his
own
exertions
which
it
is
the
function
of
the
master
to
encourage
and
direct
perhaps
this
may
seem
very
obvious
truth
but
obvious
or
not
it
has
been
very
generally
neglected
the
old
system
of
lecturing
which
found
favour
with
the
jesuits
has
indeed
now
passed
away
and
boys
are
left
to
acquire
facts
from
instead
of
from
the
master
but
this
change
is
merely
accidental
the
essence
of
the
teaching
still
remains
even
where
the
master
does
not
confine
himself
to
hearing
what
the
scholars
have
learnt
by
heart
he
seldom
does
more
than
offer
explanations
he
measures
the
teaching
rather
by
the
amount
which
has
been
put
before
the
what
he
has
done
for
them
and
shown
by
what
they
have
learned
but
this
is
not
teaching
of
the
highest
type
when
the
votary
of
dulness
in
the
is
rendering
an
account
of
his
services
he
arrives
at
this
climax
thee
explain
a
thing
till
all
men
doubt
it
and
write
about
it
goddess
and
about
and
in
the
same
spirit
wilson
stigmatises
as
synonymous
most
stupid
and
most
all
the
eminent
authorities
on
education
have
a
very
different
theory
of
the
teachers
function
according
to
them
the
attention
is
not
to
be
fixed
on
his
own
mind
and
his
own
store
of
knowledge
but
on
his
mind
and
on
its
gradual
expansion
he
must
in
fact
be
not
so
much
a
as
a
here
we
have
the
view
which
jacotot
intended
to
enforce
by
his
paradox
for
we
may
possibly
train
faculties
which
we
do
not
ourselves
possess
just
as
the
sportsman
trains
his
pointer
and
his
hunter
to
perform
feats
which
are
altogether
out
of
the
range
of
his
own
capacities
now
is
the
cultivation
bestowed
on
any
set
of
faculties
with
the
object
of
developing
wilson
and
to
train
any
faculty
you
must
set
it
to
work
hence
it
follows
that
as
minds
are
not
simply
their
memories
the
master
must
aim
at
something
more
than
causing
his
pupils
to
remember
facts
jacotot
has
done
good
service
to
education
by
giving
prominence
to
this
truth
and
by
showing
in
his
method
how
other
faculties
may
be
cultivated
besides
the
memory
est
dans
is
in
is
another
of
paradoxes
i
do
not
propose
discussing
it
as
the
philosophical
thesis
which
takes
other
forms
as
man
is
a
microcosm
but
merely
to
inquire
into
its
meaning
as
applied
to
didactics
if
you
asked
an
ordinary
french
schoolmaster
who
jacotot
was
he
would
probably
answer
jacotot
was
a
man
who
thought
you
could
learn
everything
by
getting
up
by
heart
by
carrying
your
investigation
further
you
would
find
that
this
account
of
him
required
modification
that
the
learning
by
heart
was
only
part
and
a
very
small
part
of
what
jacotot
demanded
from
his
pupils
but
you
would
also
find
that
entire
mastery
of
was
the
first
requisite
and
that
he
managed
to
connect
everything
he
taught
with
that
of
course
if
est
dans
tout
everything
is
in
and
said
an
objector
also
in
the
first
book
of
and
in
first
jacotot
went
through
a
variety
of
subtilties
to
show
that
all
is
contained
in
the
word
and
perhaps
he
would
have
been
equally
successful
if
he
had
been
required
to
take
only
the
first
letter
instead
of
the
first
word
his
maxim
indeed
becomes
by
his
treatment
of
it
a
mere
paraphrase
of
ex
the
reader
is
amused
rather
than
convinced
by
these
discussions
but
he
finds
them
not
without
fruit
they
bring
to
his
mind
very
forcibly
a
truth
to
which
he
has
hitherto
probably
not
paid
sufficient
attention
he
sees
that
all
knowledge
is
connected
together
or
what
will
do
equally
well
for
our
present
purpose
that
there
are
a
thousand
links
by
which
we
may
bring
into
connexion
the
different
subjects
of
knowledge
if
by
means
of
these
links
we
can
attach
in
our
minds
the
knowledge
we
acquire
to
the
knowledge
we
already
possess
we
shall
learn
faster
and
more
intelligently
and
at
the
same
time
we
shall
have
a
much
better
chance
of
retaining
our
new
acquisitions
the
memory
as
we
all
know
is
assisted
even
by
artificial
association
of
ideas
much
more
by
natural
hence
the
value
of
est
dans
tout
or
to
adopt
a
modification
suggested
by
joseph
payne
of
the
connexion
of
knowledges
suppose
we
know
only
one
subject
but
know
that
thoroughly
our
knowledge
if
i
may
express
myself
algebraically
can
not
be
represented
by
ignorance
plus
the
knowledge
of
that
subject
we
have
acquired
a
great
deal
more
than
that
when
other
subjects
come
before
us
they
may
prove
to
be
so
connected
with
what
we
had
before
that
we
may
also
seem
to
know
them
already
in
other
words
when
we
know
a
little
thoroughly
though
our
actual
possession
is
small
we
have
potentially
a
great
deal
more
practical
application
of
his
est
dans
was
as
follows
faut
apprendre
quelque
chose
et
y
rapporter
tout
le
pupil
must
learn
something
thoroughly
and
refer
everything
to
for
language
he
must
take
a
model
book
and
become
thoroughly
master
of
it
his
knowledge
must
not
be
a
verbal
knowledge
only
but
he
must
enter
into
the
sense
and
spirit
of
the
writer
here
we
find
that
practical
advice
coincides
with
that
of
many
other
great
authorities
who
do
not
base
it
on
the
same
principle
the
maxim
was
that
their
pupils
should
always
learn
something
thoroughly
however
little
it
might
be
pestalozzi
insisted
on
the
children
going
over
the
elements
again
and
again
till
they
were
completely
master
of
them
ascham
ratke
and
comenius
all
required
a
to
be
read
and
till
words
and
thoughts
were
firmly
fixed
in
the
memory
jacotot
probably
never
read
if
he
had
done
so
he
might
have
appropriated
some
of
words
as
exactly
conveying
his
own
thoughts
ascham
as
we
saw
recommended
that
a
short
book
should
be
thoroughly
mastered
each
lesson
being
worked
over
in
different
ways
a
dozen
times
at
the
least
and
in
this
way
scholar
shall
be
brought
not
only
to
like
eloquence
but
also
to
all
true
understanding
and
right
judgment
both
for
writing
and
in
this
the
englishman
and
the
frenchman
are
in
perfect
accord
but
if
jacotot
agrees
so
far
with
earlier
authorities
there
is
one
point
in
which
he
seems
to
differ
from
them
he
makes
great
demands
on
the
memory
and
requires
six
books
of
to
be
learned
by
heart
on
the
other
hand
montaigne
locke
rousseau
spencer
and
other
great
writers
would
be
opposed
to
this
ratke
insisted
that
nothing
should
be
learnt
by
heart
protests
against
the
memory
without
book
are
everywhere
to
be
met
with
and
nowhere
more
vigorously
expressed
than
in
ascham
he
says
of
the
boys
of
his
time
that
whole
knowledge
by
learning
without
the
book
was
tied
only
to
their
tongue
and
lips
and
never
ascended
up
to
the
brain
and
head
and
therefore
was
soon
spit
out
of
the
mouth
again
they
learnt
without
book
everything
they
understood
within
the
book
little
or
but
these
protests
were
really
directed
at
verbal
knowledge
when
it
is
made
to
take
the
place
of
knowledge
of
the
thing
signified
we
are
always
too
ready
to
suppose
that
words
are
connected
with
ideas
though
both
old
and
young
are
constantly
exposing
themselves
to
the
sarcasm
of
mephistopheles
eben
wo
begriffe
fehlen
da
stellt
ein
wort
zur
rechten
zeit
sich
ein
just
where
meaning
fails
a
word
comes
patly
in
to
serve
your
turn
against
this
danger
jacotot
took
special
precautions
the
pupil
was
to
undergo
an
examination
in
everything
connected
with
the
lesson
learnt
and
the
share
in
the
work
was
to
convince
himself
from
the
answers
he
received
that
the
pupil
thoroughly
grasped
the
meaning
as
well
as
remembered
the
words
of
the
author
still
the
six
books
of
which
jacotot
gave
to
be
learnt
by
heart
was
a
very
large
dose
and
he
would
have
been
more
faithful
to
his
own
principles
says
joseph
payne
if
he
had
given
the
first
book
only
there
are
three
ways
in
which
the
may
be
studied
it
may
be
read
through
rapidly
again
and
again
which
was
plan
and
or
each
lesson
may
be
thoroughly
mastered
read
in
various
ways
a
dozen
times
at
the
least
which
was
plan
or
the
pupil
may
begin
always
at
the
beginning
and
advance
a
little
further
each
time
which
was
plan
this
last
could
not
of
course
be
carried
very
far
the
repetitions
when
the
pupil
had
got
on
some
way
in
the
book
could
not
always
be
from
the
beginning
still
every
part
was
to
be
repeated
so
frequently
that
could
be
jacotot
did
not
wish
his
pupils
to
learn
simply
in
order
to
forget
but
to
learn
in
order
to
remember
for
ever
are
learned
said
he
so
far
as
we
have
learned
but
only
so
far
as
we
he
seems
indeed
almost
to
ignore
the
fact
that
the
act
of
learning
serves
other
purposes
than
that
of
making
learned
and
to
assert
that
to
forget
is
the
same
as
never
to
have
learned
which
is
a
palpable
error
we
necessarily
forget
much
that
passes
through
our
minds
and
yet
its
effect
remains
all
grown
people
have
arrived
at
some
opinions
convictions
knowledge
but
they
can
not
call
to
mind
every
spot
they
trod
on
in
the
road
thither
when
we
have
read
a
great
history
say
or
travelled
through
a
fresh
country
we
have
gained
more
than
the
number
of
facts
we
happen
to
remember
the
mind
seems
to
have
formed
an
acquaintance
with
that
history
or
that
country
which
is
something
different
from
the
mere
acquisition
of
facts
moreover
our
interests
as
well
as
our
ideas
may
long
survive
the
memory
of
the
facts
which
originally
started
them
we
are
told
that
one
of
the
old
judges
when
a
barrister
objected
to
some
dictum
of
his
put
him
down
by
the
assertion
i
have
forgotten
more
law
than
ever
you
if
he
wished
to
make
the
amount
forgotten
a
measure
of
the
amount
remembered
this
was
certainly
fallacious
as
the
ratio
between
the
two
is
not
a
constant
quantity
but
he
may
have
meant
that
this
extensive
reading
had
left
its
result
and
that
he
could
see
things
from
more
points
of
view
than
the
less
travelled
legal
vision
of
his
opponent
that
acquired
by
learning
may
also
last
longer
than
the
knowledge
of
the
thing
learned
is
sufficiently
obvious
so
the
advantages
derived
from
having
learnt
a
thing
are
not
entirely
lost
when
the
thing
itself
is
forgotten
but
the
reflection
by
no
means
justifies
the
disgraceful
waste
of
memory
which
goes
on
in
most
much
is
learnt
which
for
want
of
the
necessary
repetition
will
soon
be
lost
again
besides
much
that
would
be
valueless
if
remembered
the
thing
to
aim
at
is
not
giving
knowledge
but
making
the
memory
a
store
house
of
such
facts
as
are
good
material
for
the
other
powers
of
the
mind
to
work
with
and
that
the
facts
may
serve
this
purpose
they
must
be
such
as
the
mind
can
thoroughly
grasp
and
handle
and
such
as
can
be
connected
together
to
is
put
together
in
order
to
build
it
is
not
cramming
the
memory
with
facts
without
connexion
and
as
herbert
spencer
calls
them
and
yet
a
great
deal
of
our
memory
is
wasted
in
storing
facts
of
this
kind
which
can
never
form
part
of
any
organism
we
do
not
teach
them
geography
as
the
germans
call
it
but
the
names
of
places
our
is
a
similar
though
disconnected
study
we
leave
our
children
ignorant
of
the
land
but
insist
on
their
getting
up
the
and
perhaps
from
a
latent
perception
of
the
uselessness
of
such
work
neither
teachers
nor
scholars
ever
think
of
these
things
as
learnt
to
be
remembered
they
are
indeed
got
up
as
schuppius
says
of
the
logic
of
his
day
spem
futuræ
latin
grammar
is
gone
through
again
and
again
and
a
boy
feels
that
the
sooner
he
gets
it
into
his
head
the
better
it
will
be
for
him
but
who
expects
that
the
lists
of
geographical
and
historical
names
which
are
learnt
one
will
be
remembered
the
next
i
have
seen
it
asserted
that
when
a
boy
leaves
school
he
has
already
forgotten
of
what
he
has
been
taught
and
i
dare
say
that
estimate
is
quite
within
the
mark
by
adopting
the
principles
of
jacotot
we
avoid
a
great
deal
of
this
waste
we
give
some
thorough
knowledge
with
which
fresh
knowledge
may
be
connected
and
it
will
then
be
found
that
perfect
familiarity
with
a
subject
is
something
beyond
the
mere
understanding
it
and
being
able
with
difficulty
to
reproduce
what
we
have
learned
by
thus
going
over
the
same
thing
again
and
again
we
acquire
a
thorough
command
over
our
knowledge
and
the
feeling
perfectly
at
home
even
within
narrow
borders
gives
a
consciousness
of
strength
an
old
adage
tells
us
that
the
is
master
of
none
but
the
master
of
one
trade
will
have
no
difficulty
in
extending
his
insight
and
capacity
beyond
it
to
use
an
illustration
which
is
of
course
an
illustration
merely
we
should
kindle
knowledge
in
children
like
fire
in
a
grate
a
stupid
servant
with
a
small
quantity
of
wood
spreads
it
over
the
whole
grate
it
blazes
away
goes
out
and
is
simply
wasted
another
who
is
wiser
or
more
experienced
kindles
the
whole
of
the
wood
at
one
spot
and
the
fire
thus
concentrated
extends
in
all
directions
similarly
we
should
concentrate
the
beginnings
of
knowledge
and
although
we
could
not
expect
to
make
much
show
for
a
time
we
might
be
sure
that
after
a
bit
the
fire
would
extend
almost
of
its
own
accord
from
joseph
payne
i
take
directions
for
carrying
out
the
rule
faut
apprendre
quelque
chose
et
y
rapporter
tout
le
learn
so
as
to
know
thoroughly
perfectly
immovably
as
well
six
months
or
twelve
months
hence
as
which
fairly
represents
the
subject
to
be
acquired
which
contains
its
essential
characteristics
repeat
that
incessantly
every
day
or
very
frequently
from
the
beginning
without
any
omission
so
that
no
part
may
be
forgotten
reflect
upon
the
matter
thus
acquired
so
as
by
degrees
to
make
it
a
possession
of
the
mind
as
well
as
of
the
memory
so
that
being
appreciated
as
a
whole
and
appreciated
in
its
minutest
parts
what
is
as
yet
unknown
may
be
it
and
interpreted
by
it
verify
or
test
general
remarks
grammatical
rules
made
by
others
by
comparing
them
with
the
facts
the
words
and
phraseology
which
you
have
learnt
yourself
in
conclusion
i
will
give
some
account
of
the
way
in
which
reading
writing
and
the
were
taught
on
the
jacototian
system
the
teacher
takes
a
book
say
lessons
points
to
the
first
word
and
names
it
the
child
looks
at
the
word
and
also
pronounces
it
then
the
teacher
does
the
same
with
the
first
two
words
then
with
the
three
first
and
robert
when
a
line
or
so
has
been
thus
gone
over
the
teacher
asks
which
word
is
robert
what
word
is
that
pointing
to
one
me
the
same
word
in
this
pointing
to
another
part
of
the
book
when
a
sentence
has
been
thus
acquired
the
words
already
known
are
analysed
into
syllables
and
these
syllables
the
child
must
pick
out
elsewhere
finally
the
same
thing
is
done
with
letters
when
the
child
can
read
a
sentence
that
sentence
is
put
before
him
written
in
and
the
child
is
required
to
copy
it
when
he
has
copied
the
first
word
he
is
led
by
the
questions
of
the
teacher
to
see
how
it
differs
from
the
original
and
then
he
tries
again
the
pupil
must
always
correct
himself
guided
only
by
questions
this
sentence
must
be
worked
at
till
the
pupil
can
write
it
pretty
well
from
memory
he
then
tries
it
in
larger
characters
by
carrying
out
this
plan
the
powers
of
observation
and
making
comparisons
are
strengthened
and
the
arts
of
reading
and
writing
are
said
to
be
very
readily
acquired
for
the
a
model
book
is
chosen
and
thoroughly
learned
suppose
is
selected
pupil
learns
by
heart
a
sentence
or
a
few
sentences
and
adds
a
few
more
still
repeating
from
the
beginning
the
teacher
after
two
or
three
lessons
of
learning
and
repeating
takes
the
matter
and
submits
it
to
the
crucible
of
the
mind
was
rasselas
who
was
his
father
what
is
the
father
of
waters
where
does
it
begin
its
course
where
is
abyssinia
where
is
egypt
where
was
rasselas
placed
what
sort
of
a
person
was
rasselas
what
is
what
are
the
of
fancy
the
of
youth
a
great
variety
of
written
exercises
is
soon
joined
with
the
learning
by
heart
pieces
must
be
written
from
memory
and
the
spelling
pointing
corrected
by
the
pupil
himself
from
the
book
the
same
piece
must
be
written
again
and
again
till
there
are
no
more
mistakes
to
correct
said
joseph
payne
who
had
himself
taught
in
this
way
the
best
plan
for
spelling
that
has
been
then
the
pupil
may
write
an
analysis
may
define
words
distinguish
between
synonyms
explain
metaphors
imitate
descriptions
write
imaginary
dialogues
or
correspondence
between
the
characters
besides
these
a
great
variety
of
grammatical
exercises
may
be
given
and
the
force
of
prefixes
and
affixes
may
be
found
out
by
the
pupils
themselves
by
collection
and
comparison
resources
even
of
such
a
book
as
will
be
found
all
but
exhaustless
while
the
training
which
the
mind
undergoes
in
the
process
of
thoroughly
mastering
it
the
acts
of
analysis
comparison
induction
and
deduction
performed
so
frequently
as
to
become
a
sort
of
second
nature
can
not
but
serve
as
an
excellent
preparation
for
the
subsequent
study
of
english
payne
we
see
from
these
instances
how
jacotot
sought
to
imitate
the
method
by
which
young
children
and
men
teach
themselves
all
such
proceed
from
objects
to
definitions
from
facts
to
reflections
and
theories
from
examples
to
rules
from
particular
observations
to
general
principles
they
pursue
in
fact
however
unconsciously
the
of
the
advantages
of
which
are
thus
set
out
in
a
passage
from
treatise
on
the
sublime
and
beautiful
am
convinced
says
he
the
method
of
teaching
which
approaches
most
nearly
to
the
method
of
investigation
is
incomparably
the
best
since
not
content
with
serving
up
a
few
barren
and
lifeless
truths
it
leads
to
the
stock
on
which
they
grew
it
tends
to
set
the
reader
or
learner
himself
in
the
track
of
invention
and
to
direct
him
into
those
paths
in
which
the
author
has
made
his
own
jacotot
i
think
the
claim
may
without
presumption
be
maintained
that
he
has
beyond
all
other
teachers
succeeded
in
the
method
of
elementary
teaching
with
the
method
of
payne
the
latter
part
of
his
life
which
did
not
end
till
jacotot
spent
in
his
native
at
valenciennes
and
then
at
paris
to
the
last
he
laboured
indefatigably
and
with
a
noble
disinterestedness
for
what
he
believed
to
be
the
of
his
for
a
time
his
system
made
great
way
in
france
but
we
now
hear
little
of
it
jacotot
has
however
lately
found
an
advocate
in
bernard
perez
who
has
written
a
book
about
him
and
also
a
very
good
article
in
xix
herbert
spencer
i
once
heard
it
said
by
a
teacher
of
great
ability
that
no
one
without
practical
acquaintance
with
the
subject
could
write
anything
worth
reading
on
education
my
own
opinion
differs
very
widely
from
this
i
am
not
indeed
prepared
to
agree
with
another
authority
much
given
to
paradox
that
the
actual
work
of
education
unfits
a
man
for
forming
enlightened
views
about
it
but
i
think
that
the
outsider
coming
fresh
to
the
subject
and
unencumbered
by
tradition
and
prejudice
may
hit
upon
truths
which
the
teacher
whose
attention
is
too
much
engrossed
with
practical
difficulties
would
fail
to
perceive
without
assistance
and
that
consequently
the
theories
of
intelligent
men
unconnected
with
the
work
of
education
deserve
our
careful
and
if
possible
our
impartial
consideration
one
of
the
most
important
works
of
this
kind
which
has
lately
appeared
is
the
treatise
of
herbert
spencer
so
eminent
a
writer
has
every
claim
to
be
listened
to
with
respect
and
in
this
book
he
speaks
with
more
than
his
individual
authority
the
views
he
has
very
vigorously
propounded
are
shared
by
a
number
of
distinguished
scientific
men
and
not
a
few
of
the
unscientific
believe
that
in
them
is
shadowed
forth
the
education
of
the
future
it
is
perhaps
to
be
regretted
that
spencer
has
not
kept
the
tone
of
one
who
investigates
the
truth
in
a
subject
of
great
difficulty
but
lays
about
him
right
and
left
after
the
manner
of
a
spirited
controversialist
this
no
doubt
makes
his
book
much
more
entertaining
reading
than
such
treatises
usually
are
but
on
the
other
hand
it
has
the
disadvantage
of
arousing
the
antagonism
of
those
whom
he
would
most
wish
to
influence
when
the
man
who
has
no
practical
acquaintance
with
education
lays
down
the
law
garnished
with
sarcasms
at
all
that
is
now
going
on
the
schoolmaster
offended
by
the
assumed
tone
of
authority
sets
himself
to
show
where
these
theories
would
not
work
instead
of
examining
what
basis
of
truth
there
is
in
them
and
how
far
they
should
influence
his
own
practice
i
shall
proceed
to
examine
proposals
with
all
the
impartiality
i
am
master
of
the
great
question
whether
the
teaching
which
gives
the
most
valuable
knowledge
is
the
same
as
that
which
best
disciplines
the
faculties
of
the
mind
spencer
dismisses
briefly
would
be
utterly
contrary
to
the
beautiful
economy
of
nature
he
says
one
kind
of
culture
were
needed
for
the
gaining
of
information
and
another
kind
were
needed
as
a
mental
but
it
seems
to
me
that
different
subjects
must
be
used
to
train
the
faculties
at
different
stages
of
development
the
processes
of
science
which
form
the
staple
of
education
in
system
can
not
be
grasped
by
the
intellect
of
a
child
scientific
discoverer
does
the
work
and
when
it
is
done
the
schoolboy
is
called
in
to
witness
the
result
to
learn
its
chief
features
by
heart
and
to
repeat
them
when
called
upon
just
as
he
is
called
on
to
name
the
mothers
of
the
patriarchs
or
to
give
an
account
of
the
eastern
campaigns
of
alexander
the
mall
this
however
affords
but
scanty
training
for
the
mind
we
want
to
draw
out
the
interests
and
to
direct
them
to
worthy
objects
we
want
not
only
to
teach
him
but
to
enable
and
encourage
him
to
teach
himself
and
if
following
advice
we
make
him
get
up
the
species
of
plants
amount
to
some
and
the
varied
forms
of
animal
life
which
are
at
some
we
may
as
spencer
tells
us
have
strengthened
his
memory
as
effectually
as
by
teaching
him
languages
but
the
pupil
will
perhaps
have
no
great
reason
to
rejoice
over
his
escape
from
the
horrors
of
the
in
præsenti
and
quæ
the
consequences
will
be
the
same
in
both
cases
we
shall
disgust
the
great
majority
of
our
scholars
with
the
acquisition
of
knowledge
and
with
the
use
of
the
powers
of
their
mind
whether
therefore
we
adopt
or
reject
conclusion
that
there
is
one
sort
of
knowledge
which
is
universally
the
most
valuable
i
think
we
must
deny
that
there
is
one
sort
of
knowledge
which
is
universally
and
at
every
stage
in
education
the
best
adapted
to
develop
the
intellectual
faculties
spencer
himself
acknowledges
this
elsewhere
is
says
he
certain
sequence
in
which
the
faculties
spontaneously
develop
and
a
certain
kind
of
knowledge
which
each
requires
during
its
it
is
for
us
to
ascertain
this
sequence
and
supply
this
knowledge
spencer
discusses
more
fully
relative
value
of
knowledges
and
this
is
a
subject
which
has
hitherto
not
met
with
the
attention
it
deserves
it
is
not
sufficient
for
us
to
prove
of
any
subject
taught
in
our
schools
that
the
knowledge
or
the
learning
of
it
is
valuable
we
must
also
show
that
the
knowledge
or
the
learning
of
it
is
of
at
least
as
great
value
as
that
of
anything
else
that
might
be
taught
in
the
same
time
we
time
to
master
all
subjects
we
need
not
be
particular
to
quote
the
old
could
a
man
be
secure
that
his
life
would
endure
as
of
old
for
a
thousand
long
years
what
things
he
might
know
what
deeds
he
might
do
and
all
without
hurry
or
care
but
we
that
have
but
lives
must
ever
bear
in
mind
our
limited
time
for
to
test
the
value
of
the
learning
imparted
in
education
we
must
look
to
the
end
of
education
this
spencer
defines
as
follows
prepare
us
for
complete
living
is
the
function
which
education
has
to
discharge
and
the
only
rational
mode
of
judging
of
an
educational
course
is
to
judge
in
what
degree
it
discharges
such
for
complete
living
we
must
know
what
way
to
treat
the
body
in
what
way
to
treat
the
mind
in
what
way
to
manage
our
affairs
in
what
way
to
bring
up
a
family
in
what
way
to
behave
as
a
citizen
in
what
way
to
utilise
those
sources
of
happiness
which
nature
to
use
all
our
faculties
to
the
greatest
advantage
of
ourselves
and
there
are
a
number
of
sciences
says
spencer
which
throw
light
on
these
subjects
it
should
therefore
be
the
business
of
education
to
impart
these
sciences
but
if
there
were
which
is
far
from
being
the
case
a
and
science
in
each
of
these
departments
those
sciences
would
not
be
understandable
by
children
nor
would
any
individual
have
time
to
master
the
whole
of
them
or
even
due
proportion
of
the
utmost
that
could
be
attempted
would
be
to
give
young
people
some
knowledge
of
the
of
such
sciences
and
the
rules
derived
from
them
but
to
this
spencer
would
object
that
it
would
tend
like
the
learning
of
languages
increase
the
already
undue
respect
for
to
consider
divisions
in
detail
we
come
first
to
knowledge
that
leads
to
that
part
of
education
which
goes
to
secure
direct
is
in
part
already
provided
for
too
momentous
to
be
left
to
our
blundering
nature
takes
it
into
her
own
but
spencer
warns
us
against
such
thwartings
of
nature
as
that
by
which
schoolmistresses
commonly
prevent
the
girls
in
their
charge
from
the
spontaneous
physical
activities
they
would
indulge
in
and
so
render
them
comparatively
incapable
of
taking
care
of
themselves
in
circumstances
of
indirect
spencer
believes
may
be
much
assisted
by
a
knowledge
of
physiology
are
often
contracted
our
members
are
often
injured
by
causes
which
superior
knowledge
would
i
believe
these
are
not
the
only
grounds
on
which
the
advocates
of
physiology
urge
its
claim
to
be
admitted
into
the
curriculum
but
these
if
they
can
be
established
are
no
doubt
very
important
is
it
true
however
that
doctors
preserve
their
own
life
and
health
or
that
of
their
children
by
their
knowledge
of
physiology
i
think
the
matter
is
open
to
dispute
spencer
does
not
he
says
very
truly
that
many
a
man
would
blush
if
convicted
of
ignorance
about
the
pronunciation
of
iphigenia
or
about
the
labours
of
hercules
who
nevertheless
would
not
scruple
to
acknowledge
that
he
had
never
heard
of
the
eustachian
tubes
and
could
not
tell
the
normal
rate
of
pulsation
terribly
adds
spencer
our
education
does
the
ornamental
override
the
useful
but
this
is
begging
the
question
at
present
classics
form
part
of
the
instruction
given
to
every
gentleman
and
physiology
does
not
this
is
the
simpler
form
of
assertion
about
the
labours
of
hercules
and
the
eustachian
tubes
and
no
one
denies
it
but
we
are
not
so
well
agreed
on
the
comparative
value
of
these
subjects
in
his
address
at
andrews
mill
showed
that
he
at
least
was
not
convinced
of
the
uselessness
of
classics
and
spencer
does
not
tell
us
how
the
knowledge
of
the
normal
state
of
pulsation
is
useful
how
to
use
his
own
test
it
however
whether
we
admit
the
claims
of
physiology
or
not
we
shall
probably
allow
that
there
are
certain
physiological
facts
and
rules
of
health
the
knowledge
of
which
would
be
of
great
practical
value
and
should
therefore
be
imparted
to
everyone
here
the
doctor
should
come
to
the
assistance
and
give
him
a
manual
from
which
to
teach
them
next
in
order
of
importance
according
to
spencer
comes
the
knowledge
which
aids
indirect
by
facilitating
the
gaining
of
a
livelihood
here
spencer
thinks
it
necessary
to
prove
to
us
that
such
sciences
as
mathematics
and
physics
and
biology
underlie
all
the
practical
arts
and
business
of
life
no
one
would
think
of
joining
issue
with
him
on
this
point
but
the
question
still
remains
what
influence
should
this
have
on
education
science
says
spencer
grounding
in
science
is
of
great
importance
both
because
it
prepares
for
all
this
business
of
life
and
because
rational
knowledge
has
an
immense
superiority
over
empirical
should
we
teach
all
sciences
to
everybody
this
is
clearly
impossible
should
we
then
decide
for
each
child
what
is
to
be
his
particular
means
of
and
instruct
him
in
those
sciences
which
will
be
most
useful
in
that
business
or
profession
in
other
words
should
we
have
a
separate
school
for
each
calling
the
only
attempt
of
this
kind
which
has
been
made
is
i
believe
the
institution
of
commercial
schools
in
germany
in
them
youths
of
fifteen
or
sixteen
enter
for
a
course
of
two
or
three
instruction
which
aims
exclusively
at
fitting
them
for
commerce
but
in
this
case
their
general
education
is
already
finished
with
us
the
lad
commonly
goes
to
work
at
the
business
itself
quite
as
soon
as
he
has
the
faculties
for
learning
the
sciences
connected
with
it
if
the
school
sends
him
to
it
with
a
love
of
knowledge
and
with
a
mind
well
disciplined
to
acquire
knowledge
this
will
be
of
more
value
to
him
than
any
special
information
as
spencer
is
here
considering
science
merely
with
reference
to
its
importance
in
earning
a
livelihood
it
is
not
beside
the
question
to
remark
that
in
a
great
number
of
instances
the
knowledge
of
the
science
which
underlies
an
operation
confers
no
practical
ability
whatever
no
one
sees
the
better
for
understanding
the
structure
of
the
eye
and
the
undulatory
theory
of
light
in
swimming
or
rowing
a
senior
wrangler
has
no
advantage
over
a
man
who
is
entirely
ignorant
about
the
laws
of
fluid
pressure
as
far
as
is
concerned
then
science
will
not
be
found
to
be
universally
serviceable
spencer
gives
instances
indeed
where
science
would
prevent
very
expensive
blundering
but
the
true
inference
is
not
that
the
blunderers
should
learn
science
but
that
they
should
mind
their
own
business
and
take
the
opinion
of
scientific
men
about
theirs
is
a
mine
says
he
the
sinking
of
which
many
shareholders
ruined
themselves
from
not
knowing
that
a
certain
fossil
belonged
to
the
old
red
sandstone
below
which
no
coal
is
perhaps
they
were
misled
by
the
little
knowledge
which
pope
tells
us
is
a
dangerous
thing
if
they
had
been
entirely
ignorant
they
would
surely
have
called
in
a
professional
geologist
whose
opinion
would
have
been
more
valuable
than
their
own
even
though
geology
had
taken
the
place
of
classics
in
their
schooling
are
men
induced
to
aid
in
carrying
out
inventions
which
a
mere
tyro
in
science
could
show
to
be
but
these
are
men
whose
function
it
would
always
be
to
lose
money
not
make
it
whatever
you
might
teach
them
i
have
great
doubt
therefore
whether
the
learning
of
sciences
will
ever
be
found
a
ready
way
of
making
a
fortune
but
directly
we
get
beyond
the
region
of
pounds
shillings
and
pence
i
agree
most
cordially
with
spencer
that
a
rational
knowledge
has
an
immense
superiority
over
empirical
knowledge
and
as
a
part
of
their
education
boys
should
be
taught
to
distinguish
the
one
from
the
other
and
to
desire
rational
knowledge
much
might
be
done
in
this
way
by
teaching
not
all
the
sciences
and
nothing
else
but
the
main
principles
of
some
one
science
which
would
enable
the
more
intelligent
boys
to
understand
and
appreciate
the
value
of
rational
explanation
of
i
believe
this
addition
to
what
was
before
a
literary
education
has
already
been
made
in
some
of
our
leading
schools
as
harrow
rugby
and
the
city
of
london
next
spencer
would
have
instruction
in
the
proper
way
of
rearing
offspring
form
a
part
of
his
curriculum
there
can
be
no
question
of
the
importance
of
this
knowledge
and
all
that
spencer
says
of
the
lamentable
ignorance
of
parents
is
unfortunately
no
less
undeniable
but
could
this
knowledge
be
imparted
early
in
life
young
people
would
naturally
take
but
little
interest
in
it
it
is
by
parents
or
at
least
by
those
who
have
some
notion
of
the
parental
responsibility
that
this
knowledge
should
be
sought
the
best
way
in
which
we
can
teach
the
young
will
be
so
to
bring
them
up
that
when
they
themselves
have
to
rear
children
the
remembrance
of
their
own
youth
may
be
a
guide
and
not
a
beacon
to
them
but
more
knowledge
than
this
is
necessary
and
i
differ
from
spencer
only
as
to
the
proper
time
for
acquiring
it
next
comes
the
knowledge
which
fits
a
man
for
the
discharge
of
his
functions
as
a
citizen
a
subject
to
which
arnold
attached
great
importance
at
the
time
of
the
first
reform
bill
and
which
deserves
our
attention
all
the
more
in
consequence
of
the
second
and
third
but
what
knowledge
are
we
to
give
for
this
purpose
one
of
the
subjects
which
seem
especially
suitable
is
history
but
history
as
it
is
now
written
is
according
to
spencer
useless
does
not
illustrate
the
right
principles
of
political
great
mass
of
historical
facts
are
facts
from
which
no
conclusions
can
be
facts
and
therefore
facts
of
no
service
in
establishing
principles
of
conduct
which
is
the
chief
use
of
facts
read
them
if
you
like
for
amusement
but
do
not
flatter
yourself
they
are
about
the
right
principles
of
political
action
we
seem
so
completely
at
sea
that
perhaps
the
main
thing
we
can
do
for
the
young
is
to
point
out
to
them
the
responsibilities
which
will
hereafter
devolve
upon
them
and
the
danger
both
to
the
state
and
the
individual
of
just
echoing
the
popular
cry
without
the
least
reflection
according
to
our
present
usage
but
history
as
it
is
now
written
by
great
historians
may
be
of
some
use
in
training
the
young
both
to
be
citizens
and
men
about
the
fifteen
decisive
battles
or
all
the
battles
in
history
would
not
make
a
man
a
more
judicious
voter
at
the
next
election
says
spencer
but
is
this
true
the
knowledge
of
what
has
been
done
in
other
times
even
by
those
whose
coronation
renders
them
so
distasteful
to
spencer
is
knowledge
which
influences
a
whole
character
and
may
therefore
affect
particular
acts
even
when
we
are
unable
to
trace
the
connexion
as
it
has
been
often
said
the
effect
of
reading
history
is
in
some
respects
the
same
as
that
of
travelling
anyone
in
vein
might
ask
a
man
has
seen
the
alps
of
what
use
will
that
be
to
him
in
weighing
out
groceries
directly
none
at
all
but
indirectly
much
the
travelled
man
will
not
be
such
a
slave
to
the
petty
views
and
customs
of
his
trade
as
the
man
who
looks
on
his
county
town
as
the
centre
of
the
universe
the
study
of
history
like
travelling
widens
the
mental
vision
frees
him
to
some
extent
from
the
bondage
of
the
present
and
prevents
his
mistaking
conventionalities
for
laws
of
nature
it
brings
home
to
him
in
all
its
force
the
truth
that
are
also
people
beyond
the
dem
berge
sind
auch
that
there
are
higher
interests
in
the
world
than
his
own
business
concerns
and
nobler
men
than
himself
or
the
best
of
his
acquaintance
it
teaches
him
what
men
are
capable
of
and
thus
gives
him
juster
views
of
his
race
and
to
have
all
this
truth
worked
into
the
mind
contributes
perhaps
as
largely
to
as
knowledge
of
the
eustachian
tubes
or
of
the
normal
rate
of
pulsation
i
think
therefore
that
the
works
of
great
historians
and
biographers
which
we
already
possess
may
be
usefully
employed
in
education
it
is
difficult
to
estimate
the
value
of
history
according
to
idea
as
it
has
yet
to
be
written
but
i
venture
to
predict
that
if
boys
instead
of
reading
about
the
history
of
nations
in
connection
with
their
leading
men
are
required
to
study
only
progress
of
society
the
subject
will
at
once
lose
all
its
interest
for
them
and
perhaps
many
of
the
facts
communicated
will
prove
after
all
no
less
unorganisable
than
the
fifteen
decisive
battles
lastly
we
come
to
that
division
of
human
life
which
includes
the
relaxations
and
amusements
filling
leisure
spencer
assures
us
that
he
will
yield
to
none
in
the
value
he
attaches
to
æsthetic
culture
and
its
pleasures
but
if
he
does
not
value
the
fine
arts
less
he
values
science
more
and
painting
music
and
poetry
would
receive
as
little
encouragement
under
his
dictatorship
as
in
the
days
of
the
commonwealth
the
fine
arts
and
occupy
the
leisure
part
of
life
so
should
they
occupy
the
leisure
part
of
this
language
is
rather
obscure
but
the
only
meaning
i
can
attach
to
it
is
that
music
drawing
poetry
may
be
taught
if
time
can
be
found
when
all
other
knowledges
are
provided
for
this
reminds
me
of
the
author
whose
works
are
so
valuable
that
they
will
be
studied
when
shakspeare
is
not
before
any
one
of
the
sciences
which
spencer
considers
so
necessary
might
employ
a
lifetime
where
then
shall
we
look
for
the
leisure
part
of
education
when
education
includes
them
all
but
if
adopting
own
measure
we
estimate
the
value
of
knowledge
by
its
influence
on
action
we
shall
probably
rank
much
higher
than
they
have
hitherto
been
placed
in
the
schemes
of
educationists
knowledge
and
skill
connected
with
the
business
of
life
are
of
necessity
acquired
in
the
discharge
of
business
but
the
knowledge
and
skill
which
make
our
leisure
valuable
to
ourselves
and
a
source
of
pleasure
to
others
can
seldom
be
gained
after
the
work
of
life
has
begun
and
yet
every
day
a
man
may
benefit
by
possessing
such
an
ability
or
may
suffer
from
the
want
of
it
one
whose
eyesight
has
been
trained
by
drawing
and
painting
finds
objects
of
interest
all
around
him
to
which
other
people
are
blind
a
primrose
by
a
brim
is
perhaps
more
to
him
who
has
a
feeling
for
its
form
and
colour
than
even
to
the
scientific
student
who
can
tell
all
about
its
classification
and
component
parts
a
knowledge
of
music
is
often
of
the
greatest
practical
service
as
by
virtue
of
it
its
possessor
is
valuable
to
his
associates
to
say
nothing
of
his
having
a
constant
source
of
pleasure
and
a
means
of
recreation
which
is
most
precious
as
a
relief
from
the
cares
of
life
of
far
greater
importance
is
the
knowledge
of
our
best
poetry
one
of
the
first
reforms
in
our
school
course
would
have
been
i
should
have
thought
to
give
this
knowledge
a
much
more
prominent
place
but
spencer
consigns
it
with
music
and
drawing
to
leisure
part
of
whether
a
man
who
was
engrossed
by
science
who
had
no
knowledge
of
the
fine
arts
except
as
they
illustrated
scientific
laws
no
acquaintance
with
the
lives
of
great
men
or
with
any
history
but
sociology
and
who
studied
the
thoughts
and
emotions
expressed
by
our
great
poets
merely
with
a
view
to
their
psychological
such
a
man
could
be
said
to
is
a
question
to
which
every
one
not
excepting
spencer
himself
would
probably
return
the
same
answer
and
yet
this
is
the
kind
of
man
which
system
would
produce
where
it
was
most
successful
let
me
now
briefly
sum
up
the
conclusions
arrived
at
and
consider
how
far
i
differ
from
spencer
i
believe
that
there
is
no
one
study
which
is
suited
to
train
the
faculties
of
the
mind
at
every
stage
of
its
development
and
that
when
we
have
decided
on
the
necessity
of
this
or
that
knowledge
we
must
consider
further
what
is
the
right
time
for
acquiring
it
i
believe
that
intellectual
education
should
aim
not
so
much
at
communicating
facts
however
valuable
as
at
showing
the
boy
what
true
knowledge
is
and
giving
him
the
power
and
the
to
acquire
it
i
believe
that
the
exclusively
scientific
teaching
which
spencer
approves
would
not
effect
this
it
would
lead
at
best
to
a
very
development
of
the
mind
it
might
fail
to
engage
the
interest
sufficiently
to
draw
out
his
faculties
and
in
this
case
the
net
outcome
of
his
would
be
no
larger
than
at
present
of
the
knowledges
which
spencer
recommends
for
special
objects
some
i
think
would
not
conduce
to
the
object
and
some
could
not
be
communicated
early
in
life
for
indirect
we
do
not
require
to
know
physiology
but
the
results
of
physiology
the
science
which
bears
on
special
pursuits
in
life
has
not
in
many
cases
any
pecuniary
value
and
although
it
is
most
desirable
that
every
one
should
study
the
science
which
makes
his
work
intelligible
to
him
this
must
usually
be
done
when
his
schooling
is
over
the
school
will
have
done
its
part
if
it
has
accustomed
him
to
the
intellectual
processes
by
which
sciences
are
learned
and
has
given
him
an
intelligent
appreciation
of
their
value
the
right
way
of
rearing
and
training
children
should
be
studied
but
not
by
the
children
themselves
the
knowledge
which
fits
a
man
to
discharge
his
duties
as
a
citizen
is
of
great
importance
and
as
arnold
pointed
out
is
likely
to
be
entirely
neglected
by
those
who
have
to
struggle
for
a
livelihood
the
schoolmaster
should
therefore
by
no
means
neglect
this
subject
with
those
of
his
pupils
whose
will
soon
be
over
but
probably
all
that
he
can
do
is
to
cultivate
in
them
a
sense
of
the
duty
and
a
capacity
for
being
their
own
teachers
the
knowledge
of
poetry
and
the
fine
arts
which
spencer
hands
over
to
the
leisure
part
of
education
is
the
only
knowledge
in
his
program
which
i
think
should
most
certainly
form
a
prominent
part
in
the
curriculum
of
every
school
i
therefore
differ
though
with
great
respect
from
the
conclusions
at
which
spencer
has
arrived
but
i
heartily
agree
with
him
that
we
are
bound
to
inquire
into
the
relative
value
of
knowledges
and
if
we
take
as
i
should
willingly
do
test
and
ask
how
does
this
or
that
knowledge
influence
action
including
in
our
inquiry
its
influence
on
mind
and
character
through
which
it
bears
upon
action
i
think
we
should
banish
from
our
schools
much
that
has
hitherto
been
taught
in
them
besides
those
old
tormentors
of
youth
laid
i
fancy
at
in
quæ
and
its
kindred
absurdities
what
we
teach
is
of
course
not
so
easily
decided
as
what
we
i
now
come
to
consider
second
chapter
in
which
under
the
heading
of
education
he
gives
an
admirable
summing
up
of
the
main
principles
in
which
the
great
writers
on
the
subject
have
agreed
from
comenius
downwards
these
principles
are
perhaps
not
all
of
them
unassailable
and
even
where
they
are
true
many
mistakes
must
be
expected
before
we
arrive
at
the
best
method
of
applying
them
but
the
only
reason
that
can
be
assigned
for
the
small
amount
of
influence
they
have
hitherto
exercised
is
that
most
teachers
are
as
ignorant
of
them
as
of
the
abstrusest
doctrines
of
kant
and
hegel
in
stating
these
principles
spencer
points
out
that
they
merely
form
a
commencement
for
a
science
of
education
educational
methods
can
be
made
to
harmonise
in
character
and
arrangement
with
the
faculties
in
the
mode
and
order
of
unfolding
it
is
first
needful
that
we
ascertain
with
some
completeness
how
the
faculties
unfold
at
present
we
have
acquired
on
this
point
only
a
few
general
notions
these
general
notions
must
be
developed
in
be
transformed
into
a
multitude
of
specific
propositions
before
we
can
be
said
to
possess
that
on
which
the
of
education
must
be
based
and
then
when
we
have
definitely
made
out
in
what
succession
and
in
what
combinations
the
mental
powers
become
active
it
remains
to
choose
out
of
the
many
possible
ways
of
exercising
each
of
them
that
which
best
conforms
to
its
natural
mode
of
action
evidently
therefore
it
is
not
to
be
supposed
that
even
our
most
advanced
modes
of
teaching
are
the
right
ones
or
nearly
the
right
it
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
that
we
have
no
science
of
education
those
who
have
been
able
to
observe
the
phenomena
have
had
no
interest
in
generalising
from
them
up
to
the
present
time
the
schoolmaster
has
been
a
person
to
whom
boys
were
sent
to
learn
latin
and
greek
he
has
had
therefore
no
more
need
of
a
science
than
the
but
the
present
century
which
has
brought
in
so
many
changes
will
not
leave
the
state
of
education
as
it
found
it
latin
and
greek
if
they
are
not
dethroned
in
our
higher
schools
will
have
their
despotism
changed
for
a
very
limited
monarchy
a
course
of
instruction
certainly
without
greek
and
perhaps
without
latin
will
have
to
be
provided
for
middle
schools
juster
views
are
beginning
to
prevail
of
the
function
it
is
at
length
perceived
that
he
has
to
assist
the
development
of
the
human
mind
and
perhaps
he
may
think
it
as
well
to
learn
all
he
can
of
that
which
he
is
employed
in
developing
when
matters
have
advanced
as
far
as
this
we
may
begin
to
hope
for
a
science
of
education
in
day
he
could
say
of
physical
science
that
there
was
no
such
science
in
existence
for
thousands
of
years
the
human
race
had
lived
in
ignorance
of
the
simplest
laws
of
the
world
it
inhabited
but
the
true
method
of
inquiring
once
introduced
science
has
made
such
rapid
conquests
and
acquired
so
great
importance
that
some
of
our
ablest
men
seem
inclined
to
deny
if
not
the
existence
at
least
the
value
of
any
other
kind
of
knowledge
so
too
when
teachers
seek
by
actual
observation
to
discover
the
laws
of
mental
development
a
science
may
be
arrived
at
which
in
its
influence
on
mankind
would
perhaps
rank
before
any
we
now
possess
those
who
have
read
the
previous
essays
will
have
seen
in
various
forms
most
of
the
principles
which
spencer
enumerates
but
i
gladly
avail
myself
of
his
assistance
in
summing
them
up
we
should
proceed
from
the
simple
to
the
complex
both
in
our
choice
of
subjects
and
in
the
way
in
which
each
subject
is
taught
we
should
begin
with
but
few
subjects
at
once
and
successively
adding
to
these
should
finally
carry
on
all
subjects
abreast
each
larger
concept
is
made
by
a
combination
of
smaller
ones
and
presupposes
them
if
this
order
is
not
attended
to
in
communicating
knowledge
the
pupil
can
learn
nothing
but
words
and
will
speedily
sink
into
apathy
and
disgust
that
we
must
proceed
from
the
known
to
the
unknown
is
something
more
than
a
corollary
to
the
above
because
not
only
are
new
concepts
formed
by
the
combination
of
old
but
the
mind
has
a
liking
for
what
it
knows
and
this
liking
extends
itself
to
all
that
can
be
connected
with
its
object
the
principle
of
using
the
known
in
teaching
the
unknown
is
so
simple
that
all
teachers
who
really
endeavour
to
make
anything
understood
naturally
adopt
it
the
traveller
who
is
describing
what
he
has
seen
and
what
we
have
not
seen
tells
us
that
it
is
in
one
particular
like
this
object
and
in
another
like
that
object
with
which
we
are
already
familiar
we
combine
these
different
concepts
we
possess
and
so
get
some
notion
of
things
about
which
we
were
previously
ignorant
what
is
required
in
our
teaching
is
that
the
use
of
the
known
should
be
employed
more
systematically
most
teachers
think
of
boys
who
have
no
school
learning
as
entirely
ignorant
the
least
reflection
shows
however
that
they
know
already
much
more
than
schools
can
ever
teach
them
a
sarcastic
examiner
is
said
to
have
handed
a
small
piece
of
paper
to
a
student
and
told
him
to
write
he
on
it
perhaps
many
boys
would
have
no
difficulty
in
stating
the
sum
of
their
within
very
narrow
limits
but
with
other
knowledge
a
child
of
five
years
old
could
he
write
might
soon
fill
a
volume
our
aim
should
be
to
connect
the
knowledge
boys
bring
with
them
to
the
schoolroom
with
that
which
they
are
to
acquire
there
i
suppose
all
will
allow
whether
they
think
it
a
matter
of
regret
or
otherwise
that
hardly
anything
of
the
kind
has
hitherto
been
attempted
against
this
state
of
things
i
can
not
refrain
from
borrowing
eloquent
protest
recognising
the
truth
that
the
function
of
books
is
they
form
an
indirect
means
to
knowledge
when
direct
means
fail
a
means
of
seeing
through
other
men
what
you
can
not
see
for
yourself
teachers
are
eager
to
give
facts
in
place
of
facts
not
perceiving
the
enormous
value
of
that
spontaneous
education
which
goes
on
in
early
years
not
perceiving
that
a
restless
observation
instead
of
being
ignored
or
checked
should
be
diligently
ministered
to
and
made
as
accurate
and
complete
as
possible
they
insist
on
occupying
its
eyes
and
thoughts
with
things
that
are
for
the
time
being
incomprehensible
and
repugnant
possessed
by
a
superstition
which
worships
the
symbols
of
knowledge
instead
of
the
knowledge
itself
they
do
not
see
that
only
when
his
acquaintance
with
the
objects
and
processes
of
the
household
the
street
and
the
fields
is
becoming
tolerably
exhaustive
only
then
should
a
child
be
introduced
to
the
new
sources
of
information
which
books
supply
and
this
not
only
because
immediate
cognition
is
of
far
greater
value
than
mediate
cognition
but
also
because
the
words
contained
in
books
can
be
rightly
interpreted
into
ideas
only
in
proportion
to
the
antecedent
experience
of
while
agreeing
heartily
in
the
spirit
of
this
protest
i
doubt
whether
we
should
wait
till
the
acquaintance
with
the
objects
and
processes
of
the
household
the
streets
and
the
fields
is
becoming
tolerably
exhaustive
before
we
give
him
instruction
from
books
the
point
of
time
which
spencer
indicates
is
at
all
events
rather
hard
to
fix
and
i
should
wish
to
connect
as
soon
as
possible
with
the
learning
that
is
being
acquired
in
other
ways
thus
might
both
the
books
and
the
acts
and
objects
of
daily
life
win
an
additional
interest
if
the
first
were
about
the
animals
and
later
on
about
the
trees
and
flowers
which
the
children
constantly
meet
with
and
their
attention
was
kept
up
by
large
coloured
pictures
to
which
the
text
might
refer
the
children
would
soon
find
both
pleasure
and
advantage
in
reading
and
they
would
look
at
the
animals
and
trees
with
a
keener
interest
from
the
additional
knowledge
of
them
they
had
derived
from
books
this
is
of
course
only
one
small
application
of
a
very
influential
principle
one
marvellous
instance
of
the
neglect
of
this
principle
is
found
in
the
practice
of
teaching
latin
grammar
before
english
grammar
as
professor
seeley
has
so
well
pointed
out
children
bring
with
them
to
school
the
knowledge
of
language
in
its
concrete
form
they
may
soon
be
taught
to
observe
the
language
they
already
know
and
to
find
almost
for
themselves
some
of
the
main
divisions
of
words
in
it
but
instead
of
availing
himself
of
the
previous
knowledge
the
schoolmaster
takes
a
new
and
difficult
language
differing
as
much
as
possible
from
english
a
new
and
difficult
science
that
of
grammar
conveyed
too
in
a
new
and
difficult
terminology
and
all
this
he
tries
to
teach
at
the
same
time
the
consequence
is
that
the
science
is
destroyed
the
terminology
is
either
misunderstood
or
more
probably
associated
with
no
ideas
and
even
the
language
for
which
every
sacrifice
is
made
is
found
in
nine
cases
out
of
ten
never
to
be
acquired
at
all
development
is
an
advance
from
the
indefinite
to
the
i
do
not
feel
very
certain
of
the
truth
of
this
principle
or
of
its
application
if
true
of
course
a
intellectual
conceptions
are
at
first
vague
and
we
should
not
forget
this
but
it
is
rather
a
fact
than
a
principle
lessons
ought
to
start
from
the
concrete
and
end
in
the
what
spencer
says
under
this
head
well
deserves
the
attention
of
all
teachers
formulas
which
men
have
devised
to
express
groups
of
details
and
which
have
severally
simplified
their
conceptions
by
uniting
many
facts
into
one
fact
they
have
supposed
must
simplify
the
conceptions
of
a
child
also
they
have
forgotten
that
a
generalisation
is
simple
only
in
comparison
with
the
whole
mass
of
particular
truths
it
comprehends
that
it
is
more
complex
than
any
one
of
these
truths
taken
simply
that
only
after
many
of
these
single
truths
have
been
acquired
does
the
generalisation
ease
the
memory
and
help
the
reason
and
that
to
a
mind
not
possessing
these
single
truths
it
is
necessarily
a
mystery
thus
confounding
two
kinds
of
simplification
teachers
have
constantly
erred
by
setting
out
with
principles
a
proceeding
essentially
though
not
apparently
at
variance
with
the
primary
rule
of
proceeding
from
the
simple
to
the
complex
which
implies
that
the
mind
should
be
introduced
to
principles
through
the
medium
of
examples
and
so
should
be
led
from
the
particular
to
the
general
from
the
concrete
to
the
in
conformity
with
this
principle
pestalozzi
made
the
actual
counting
of
things
precede
the
teaching
of
abstract
rules
in
arithmetic
basedow
introduced
weights
and
measures
into
the
school
and
spencer
describes
some
exercise
in
cutting
out
geometrical
figures
in
cardboard
as
a
preparation
for
geometry
the
difficulty
about
such
instruction
is
that
it
requires
apparatus
and
apparatus
is
apt
to
get
lost
or
out
of
order
but
if
apparatus
is
good
for
anything
at
all
it
is
worth
a
little
trouble
there
is
a
tendency
in
the
minds
of
many
teachers
to
depreciate
even
a
decent
is
not
always
to
be
found
in
our
higher
schools
but
though
such
appliances
will
not
enable
a
bad
master
to
teach
well
nevertheless
other
things
being
equal
the
master
will
teach
better
with
them
than
without
them
there
is
little
credit
due
to
him
for
managing
to
dispense
with
apparatus
an
author
might
as
well
pride
himself
on
being
saving
in
pens
and
paper
genesis
of
knowledge
in
the
individual
must
follow
the
same
course
as
the
genesis
of
knowledge
in
the
this
is
the
thesis
on
which
i
have
no
opinion
to
offer
from
the
above
principle
spencer
infers
that
every
study
should
have
a
purely
experimental
introduction
thus
proceeding
through
an
empirical
stage
to
a
rational
a
second
conclusion
which
spencer
draws
is
that
in
education
the
process
of
should
be
encouraged
to
the
utmost
children
should
be
led
to
make
their
own
investigations
and
to
draw
their
own
inferences
they
should
be
told
as
little
as
possible
and
induced
to
discover
as
much
as
possible
i
quite
agree
with
spencer
that
this
principle
can
not
be
too
strenuously
insisted
on
though
it
obviously
demands
a
high
amount
of
intelligence
in
the
teacher
but
if
education
is
to
be
a
training
of
the
faculties
if
it
is
to
prepare
the
pupil
to
teach
himself
something
more
is
needed
than
simply
to
pour
in
knowledge
and
make
the
pupil
reproduce
it
the
receptive
and
reproductive
faculties
form
but
a
small
portion
of
a
powers
and
yet
the
only
portion
which
many
schoolmasters
seek
to
cultivate
it
is
indeed
not
easy
to
get
beyond
this
point
but
the
impediment
is
in
us
not
in
the
children
can
watch
ask
spencer
ceaseless
observation
and
inquiry
and
inference
going
on
in
a
mind
or
listen
to
its
acute
remarks
in
matters
within
the
range
of
its
faculties
without
perceiving
that
these
powers
it
manifests
if
brought
to
bear
systematically
upon
studies
the
same
would
readily
master
them
without
help
this
need
for
perpetual
telling
results
from
our
stupidity
not
from
the
we
drag
it
away
from
the
facts
in
which
it
is
interested
and
which
it
is
actively
assimilating
of
itself
we
put
before
it
facts
far
too
complex
for
it
to
understand
and
therefore
distasteful
to
it
finding
that
it
will
not
voluntarily
acquire
these
facts
we
thrust
them
into
its
mind
by
force
of
threats
and
punishment
by
thus
denying
the
knowledge
it
craves
and
cramming
it
with
knowledge
it
can
not
digest
we
produce
a
morbid
state
of
its
faculties
and
a
consequent
disgust
for
knowledge
in
general
and
when
as
a
result
partly
of
the
stolid
indolence
we
have
brought
on
and
partly
of
unfitness
in
its
studies
the
child
can
understand
nothing
without
explanation
and
becomes
a
mere
passive
recipient
of
our
instruction
we
infer
that
education
must
necessarily
be
carried
on
thus
having
by
our
method
induced
helplessness
we
make
the
helplessness
a
reason
for
our
it
is
of
course
much
easier
to
point
out
defects
than
to
remedy
them
but
every
one
who
has
observed
the
usual
indifference
of
schoolboys
to
their
work
and
the
waste
of
time
consequent
on
their
inattention
or
only
attention
to
the
matter
before
them
and
then
thinks
of
the
eagerness
with
which
the
same
boys
throw
themselves
into
the
pursuits
of
their
will
feel
a
desire
to
get
at
the
cause
of
this
difference
and
perhaps
it
may
seem
to
him
partly
accounted
for
by
the
fact
that
their
makes
a
monotonous
demand
on
a
single
memory
this
brings
me
to
the
last
of
principles
of
intellectual
education
instruction
must
excite
the
interest
of
the
pupils
and
therefore
be
pleasurable
to
them
has
made
the
healthful
exercise
of
our
faculties
both
of
mind
and
body
pleasurable
it
is
true
that
some
of
the
highest
mental
powers
as
yet
but
little
developed
in
the
race
and
congenitally
possessed
in
any
considerable
degree
only
by
the
most
advanced
are
indisposed
to
the
amount
of
exertion
required
of
them
but
these
in
virtue
of
their
very
complexity
will
in
a
normal
course
of
culture
come
last
into
exercise
and
will
therefore
have
no
demands
made
on
them
until
the
pupil
has
arrived
at
an
age
when
ulterior
motives
can
be
brought
into
play
and
an
indirect
pleasure
made
to
counterbalance
a
direct
displeasure
with
all
faculties
lower
than
these
however
the
immediate
gratification
consequent
on
activity
is
the
normal
stimulus
and
under
good
management
the
only
needful
stimulus
when
we
have
to
fall
back
on
some
other
we
must
take
the
fact
as
evidence
that
we
are
on
the
wrong
track
experience
is
daily
showing
with
greater
clearness
that
there
is
always
a
method
to
be
found
productive
of
of
it
ever
turns
out
that
this
is
the
method
proved
by
all
other
tests
to
be
the
right
as
far
as
i
have
had
the
means
of
judging
i
have
found
that
the
majority
of
teachers
reject
this
principle
if
you
ask
them
why
most
of
them
will
tell
you
that
it
is
impossible
to
make
interesting
to
children
a
large
number
also
hold
that
it
is
not
desirable
let
us
consider
these
two
points
separately
of
course
if
it
is
not
possible
to
get
children
to
take
interest
in
anything
they
could
be
taught
in
school
there
is
an
end
of
the
matter
but
no
one
really
goes
as
far
as
this
every
teacher
finds
that
some
of
the
things
boys
are
taught
they
like
better
than
others
and
perhaps
that
one
boy
takes
to
one
subject
and
another
to
another
and
he
also
finds
both
of
classes
and
individuals
that
they
always
get
on
best
with
what
they
like
best
the
utmost
that
can
be
maintained
is
then
that
some
subjects
which
must
be
taught
will
not
interest
the
majority
of
the
learners
and
if
it
be
once
admitted
that
it
is
desirable
to
make
learning
pleasant
and
interesting
to
our
pupils
this
principle
will
influence
us
to
some
extent
in
the
subjects
we
select
for
teaching
and
still
more
in
the
methods
by
which
we
endeavour
to
teach
them
i
say
we
shall
be
guided
some
in
the
selection
of
subjects
there
are
theorists
who
assert
that
nature
gives
to
young
minds
a
craving
for
their
proper
aliment
so
that
they
should
be
taught
only
what
they
show
an
inclination
for
but
surely
our
natural
inclinations
in
this
matter
as
in
others
are
neither
on
the
one
hand
to
be
ignored
nor
on
the
other
to
be
uncontrolled
by
such
motives
as
our
reason
dictates
to
us
we
at
length
perceive
this
in
the
physical
nurture
of
our
children
locke
directs
that
children
are
to
have
very
little
sugar
or
salt
of
all
kinds
are
to
be
avoided
says
he
whether
they
do
more
harm
to
the
maker
or
eater
is
not
easy
to
ed
now
however
doctors
have
found
out
that
young
taste
for
sweets
should
in
moderation
be
gratified
that
they
require
sugar
as
much
as
they
require
any
other
kind
of
nutriment
but
no
one
would
think
of
feeding
his
children
entirely
on
sweetmeats
or
even
of
letting
them
have
an
unlimited
supply
of
plum
puddings
and
hardbake
if
we
follow
out
this
analogy
in
nourishing
the
mind
we
shall
to
some
extent
gratify
a
taste
for
whilst
we
also
provide
a
large
amount
of
more
solid
fare
but
although
we
should
certainly
not
ignore
our
likes
and
dislikes
in
learning
or
in
anything
else
it
is
easy
to
attach
too
much
importance
to
them
dislike
very
often
proceeds
from
mere
want
of
insight
into
the
subject
when
a
boy
has
the
first
book
of
euclid
without
knowing
how
to
judge
of
the
size
of
an
angle
or
the
second
book
without
forming
any
conception
of
a
rectangle
no
one
can
be
surprised
at
his
not
liking
euclid
and
then
the
failure
which
is
really
due
to
bad
teaching
is
attributed
by
the
master
to
the
stupidity
of
his
pupil
and
by
the
pupil
to
the
dulness
of
the
subject
if
masters
really
desired
to
make
learning
a
pleasure
to
their
pupils
i
think
they
would
find
that
much
might
be
done
to
effect
this
without
any
alteration
in
the
subjects
taught
but
the
present
dulness
of
is
not
without
its
defenders
they
insist
on
the
importance
of
breaking
in
the
mind
to
hard
work
this
can
only
be
done
they
say
by
tasks
which
are
repulsive
to
it
the
schoolboy
does
not
like
and
ought
not
to
like
learning
latin
grammar
any
more
than
the
colt
should
find
pleasure
in
running
round
in
a
circle
the
very
fact
that
these
things
are
not
pleasant
makes
them
beneficial
perhaps
a
certain
amount
of
such
training
may
train
the
mind
and
qualify
it
for
some
drudgery
from
which
it
might
otherwise
revolt
but
if
this
result
is
attained
it
is
attained
at
the
sacrifice
of
the
intellectual
activity
which
is
necessary
for
any
higher
function
as
carlyle
says
no
iij
when
speaking
of
routine
work
generally
you
want
nothing
but
a
sorry
nag
to
draw
your
your
arab
will
be
dangerous
in
such
a
capacity
but
who
would
advocate
for
all
colts
a
training
which
should
render
them
fit
for
nothing
but
such
humble
toil
i
shall
say
more
about
this
further
on
pp
here
i
will
merely
express
my
strong
conviction
that
minds
are
frequently
dwarfed
and
their
interest
in
intellectual
pursuits
blighted
by
the
practice
of
employing
the
first
years
of
their
in
learning
by
heart
things
which
it
is
quite
impossible
for
them
to
understand
or
care
for
teachers
set
out
by
assuming
that
little
boys
can
not
understand
anything
and
that
all
we
can
do
with
them
is
to
keep
them
quiet
and
cram
them
with
forms
which
will
come
in
useful
at
a
later
age
when
the
boys
have
been
taught
on
this
system
for
two
or
three
years
their
teacher
complains
that
they
are
stupid
and
inattentive
and
that
so
long
as
they
can
say
a
thing
by
heart
they
never
trouble
themselves
to
understand
it
in
other
words
the
teacher
grumbles
at
them
for
doing
precisely
what
they
have
been
taught
to
do
for
repeating
words
without
any
thought
of
their
meaning
in
this
very
important
matter
i
am
fully
alive
to
the
difference
between
theory
and
practice
it
is
so
easy
to
recommend
that
boys
should
be
got
to
understand
and
take
an
interest
in
their
difficult
to
carry
out
the
recommendation
grown
people
can
hardly
conceive
that
words
which
have
in
their
minds
been
associated
with
familiar
ideas
from
time
immemorial
are
mere
sounds
in
the
mouths
of
their
pupils
the
teacher
thinks
he
is
beginning
at
the
beginning
if
he
says
that
a
transitive
verb
must
govern
an
accusative
or
that
all
the
angles
of
a
square
are
right
angles
he
gives
his
pupils
credit
for
innate
ideas
up
to
this
point
at
all
events
and
advancing
on
this
supposition
he
finds
that
he
can
get
nothing
out
of
them
but
so
he
insists
on
this
that
his
time
and
theirs
may
seem
not
to
be
wholly
wasted
the
great
difficulty
of
teaching
well
however
is
after
all
but
a
poor
excuse
for
contentedly
teaching
badly
and
it
would
be
a
great
step
in
advance
if
teachers
in
general
were
as
dissatisfied
with
themselves
as
they
usually
are
with
their
pupils
i
do
not
purpose
following
spencer
through
his
chapters
on
moral
and
physical
education
in
practice
i
find
i
can
draw
no
line
between
moral
and
religious
education
so
the
discussion
of
one
without
the
other
has
not
for
me
much
interest
spencer
has
some
very
valuable
remarks
on
physical
education
which
i
could
do
little
more
than
extract
and
i
have
already
made
too
many
quotations
from
a
work
which
will
be
in
the
hands
of
most
of
my
readers
spencer
differs
very
widely
from
the
great
body
of
our
schoolmasters
i
have
ventured
in
turn
to
differ
on
some
points
from
spencer
but
i
have
failed
to
give
any
adequate
notion
of
the
work
i
have
been
discussing
if
the
reader
has
not
perceived
that
it
is
not
only
one
of
the
most
readable
but
also
one
of
the
most
important
books
on
education
in
the
english
language
xx
thoughts
and
suggestions
one
of
the
great
wants
of
education
at
present
is
an
ideal
to
work
towards
our
old
public
schools
have
such
an
ideal
the
model
public
is
a
gentleman
who
is
an
elegant
latin
and
greek
scholar
true
this
may
not
be
a
very
good
ideal
and
some
of
our
ablest
men
both
literary
and
scientific
are
profoundly
dissatisfied
with
it
but
so
long
as
it
is
maintained
all
questions
of
reform
are
comparatively
simple
in
schools
on
the
other
hand
there
is
no
ad
a
number
of
boys
are
got
together
and
the
question
arises
not
simply
to
teach
but
to
teach
where
the
masters
are
not
university
men
they
are
it
may
be
not
men
of
broad
views
or
high
culture
of
course
no
one
will
suppose
me
ignorant
of
the
fact
that
a
great
number
of
teachers
who
have
never
been
at
a
university
are
both
enlightened
and
highly
cultivated
and
also
that
many
teachers
who
have
taken
degrees
even
in
honours
are
neither
but
speaking
broadly
of
the
two
classes
i
may
fairly
assume
that
the
men
are
inferior
in
these
respects
to
the
graduates
if
not
our
universities
should
be
reformed
on
principle
without
further
loss
of
time
many
masters
have
been
engaged
in
teaching
ever
since
they
were
boys
themselves
and
teaching
is
a
very
narrowing
occupation
they
are
apt
therefore
to
be
careless
of
general
principles
and
to
aim
merely
at
storing
their
memory
with
about
language
about
history
about
geography
without
troubling
themselves
to
consider
what
is
and
what
is
not
worth
knowing
or
what
faculties
the
boys
have
and
how
they
should
be
developed
the
consequence
is
their
boys
get
up
for
the
purpose
of
forgetting
with
all
convenient
speed
quantities
of
details
about
as
instructive
and
entertaining
as
the
quæ
such
as
the
division
of
england
under
the
heptarchy
the
battles
in
the
wars
of
the
roses
and
lists
of
geographical
names
where
the
masters
are
university
men
they
have
rather
a
contempt
for
this
kind
of
cramming
which
makes
them
do
it
badly
if
they
attempt
it
at
all
but
they
are
driven
to
this
teaching
in
many
cases
because
they
do
not
know
what
to
substitute
in
its
place
in
their
own
they
were
taught
classics
and
mathematics
and
nothing
else
their
pupils
are
too
young
to
have
much
capacity
for
mathematics
and
they
will
leave
school
too
soon
to
get
any
sound
knowledge
of
classics
so
the
strength
of
the
teaching
ought
clearly
not
to
be
thrown
into
these
subjects
but
the
master
really
knows
no
other
he
soon
finds
that
he
is
not
much
his
superior
in
acquaintance
with
the
theory
of
the
english
language
or
with
history
and
geography
there
are
not
many
men
with
sufficient
strength
of
will
to
study
whilst
their
energies
are
taxed
by
teaching
and
standard
books
are
not
always
within
reach
so
the
master
is
forced
to
content
himself
with
hearing
lessons
in
a
perfunctory
way
out
of
dreary
hence
it
comes
to
pass
that
he
goes
on
teaching
subjects
of
which
he
himself
is
ignorant
subjects
too
of
which
he
does
not
recognise
the
importance
with
an
enlightened
disbelief
in
his
own
method
of
tuition
he
finds
it
uphill
work
to
be
sure
and
is
conscious
that
his
pupils
do
not
get
on
however
hard
he
may
try
to
drive
them
but
he
never
hoped
for
success
in
his
teaching
so
the
want
of
it
does
not
distress
him
i
may
be
suspected
of
caricature
but
not
i
think
by
university
men
who
have
themselves
had
to
teach
anything
besides
classics
and
mathematics
if
there
is
any
truth
in
what
i
have
been
saying
in
subjects
other
than
classics
and
mathematics
which
i
am
not
now
considering
is
very
commonly
a
failure
and
a
failure
it
must
remain
until
boys
can
be
got
to
work
with
a
will
in
other
words
to
feel
interest
in
the
subject
taught
i
know
there
is
a
strong
prejudice
in
some
minds
against
the
notion
of
making
learning
pleasant
they
remind
us
that
school
should
be
a
preparation
for
will
bring
with
it
an
immense
amount
of
drudgery
if
they
say
things
at
school
are
made
too
easy
and
pleasant
words
by
the
way
very
often
and
very
erroneously
confounded
school
will
cease
to
give
the
proper
discipline
boys
will
be
turned
out
not
knowing
what
hard
work
is
which
after
all
is
the
most
important
lesson
that
can
be
taught
them
in
these
views
i
sincerely
concur
so
far
as
this
at
least
that
we
want
boys
to
work
hard
and
vigorously
to
go
through
the
necessary
drudgery
labour
in
itself
disagreeable
but
this
result
is
not
attained
by
such
a
system
as
i
have
described
boys
do
not
learn
to
work
but
in
a
dull
stupid
way
with
most
of
their
faculties
lying
dormant
and
though
they
are
put
through
a
vast
quantity
of
drudgery
they
seem
as
incapable
of
throwing
any
energy
into
it
as
prisoners
on
the
i
think
we
shall
find
on
consideration
that
no
one
succeeds
in
any
occupation
unless
that
occupation
is
interesting
either
in
itself
or
from
some
object
that
is
to
be
obtained
by
means
of
it
only
when
such
an
interest
is
aroused
is
energy
possible
no
one
will
deny
that
as
a
rule
the
most
successful
men
are
those
for
whom
their
employment
has
the
greatest
attractions
we
should
be
sorry
to
give
ourselves
up
to
the
treatment
of
a
doctor
who
thought
the
study
of
disease
mere
drudgery
or
a
dentist
who
felt
a
strong
repugnance
to
operating
on
teeth
no
doubt
the
successful
man
in
every
pursuit
has
to
go
through
a
great
deal
of
drudgery
but
he
has
a
general
interest
in
the
subject
which
extends
partially
at
least
to
its
most
wearisome
details
his
energy
too
is
excited
by
the
desire
of
what
the
drudgery
will
gain
for
him
observe
that
although
i
would
have
boys
take
pleasure
in
their
work
i
regard
the
pleasure
as
a
not
an
end
if
it
could
be
proved
that
the
mind
was
best
trained
by
the
most
repulsive
exercises
i
should
most
certainly
enforce
them
but
i
do
not
think
that
the
mind
benefited
by
labour
indeed
hardly
any
of
its
faculties
are
capable
of
such
labour
we
can
compel
a
boy
to
learn
a
thing
by
heart
but
we
can
not
compel
him
to
wish
to
understand
it
and
the
intellect
does
not
act
without
the
will
hence
when
anything
is
required
which
can
not
be
performed
by
the
memory
alone
the
driving
system
utterly
breaks
down
and
even
the
memory
as
i
hope
to
show
presently
works
much
more
effectually
in
matters
about
which
the
mind
feels
an
interest
indeed
the
mind
without
sympathy
and
interest
is
like
the
when
the
tide
is
down
an
unlovely
thing
closed
against
external
influences
enduring
existence
as
best
it
can
but
let
it
find
itself
in
a
more
congenial
element
and
it
opens
out
at
once
shows
altogether
unexpected
capacities
and
eagerly
assimilates
all
the
proper
food
that
comes
within
its
reach
our
school
teaching
is
often
little
better
than
an
attempt
to
get
to
flourish
on
dry
land
we
see
then
that
a
boy
before
he
can
throw
energy
into
a
study
must
find
that
study
in
itself
or
in
its
some
subjects
properly
taught
are
interesting
in
themselves
some
subjects
may
be
interesting
to
older
and
more
thoughtful
boys
from
a
perception
of
their
usefulness
all
subjects
may
be
made
interesting
by
emulation
hardly
any
effort
is
made
in
some
schools
to
interest
the
younger
children
in
their
work
and
yet
no
effort
can
be
as
the
germans
say
more
the
teacher
of
children
has
this
advantage
that
his
pupils
are
never
dull
and
listless
as
youths
are
apt
to
be
if
they
are
not
attending
to
him
they
very
soon
give
him
notice
of
it
and
if
he
has
the
sense
to
see
that
their
inattention
is
his
fault
not
theirs
this
will
save
him
much
annoyance
and
them
much
misery
he
has
too
another
advantage
which
gives
him
the
power
of
gaining
their
emulation
is
easily
excited
in
the
waisenhaus
at
halle
i
once
heard
a
class
of
very
young
children
none
of
them
much
above
six
years
old
perform
feats
of
mental
arithmetic
quite
as
i
should
have
said
beyond
their
age
and
i
well
remember
the
pretty
eagerness
with
which
each
child
held
out
a
little
hand
and
shouted
bitte
to
gain
the
privilege
of
answering
then
again
there
are
many
subjects
in
which
children
take
an
interest
indeed
all
visible
things
especially
animals
are
much
more
to
them
than
to
us
a
child
has
made
acquaintance
with
all
the
animals
in
the
neighbourhood
and
can
tell
you
much
more
about
the
house
and
its
surroundings
than
you
know
yourself
but
all
this
knowledge
and
interest
you
would
wish
forgotten
directly
he
comes
into
school
reading
writing
and
figures
are
taught
in
the
driest
manner
the
two
first
are
in
themselves
not
uninteresting
to
the
child
as
he
has
something
to
do
and
young
people
are
much
more
ready
to
do
anything
than
to
learn
anything
but
when
lessons
are
given
the
child
to
learn
they
are
not
about
things
concerning
which
he
has
ideas
and
feels
an
interest
but
you
teach
him
mere
that
alfred
to
him
only
a
name
came
to
the
throne
in
though
he
has
no
notion
what
the
throne
is
or
what
means
the
child
learns
the
lesson
with
much
trouble
and
small
profit
bearing
the
infliction
with
what
patience
he
can
till
he
escapes
out
of
school
and
begins
to
learn
much
faster
on
a
very
different
system
we
can
not
often
introduce
into
the
school
the
thing
much
less
the
animal
which
children
would
care
to
see
but
we
can
introduce
what
will
please
them
as
well
in
some
cases
even
better
good
pictures
a
teacher
who
could
draw
boldly
on
the
blackboard
would
have
no
difficulty
in
arresting
the
attention
but
at
present
few
can
do
this
and
pictures
must
be
provided
a
good
deal
has
been
done
of
late
years
in
the
way
of
illustrating
books
and
even
childhood
must
be
the
happier
for
such
pictures
as
those
of
tenniel
and
harrison
weir
but
it
seems
well
understood
that
these
gentlemen
are
incapable
of
doing
anything
for
children
beyond
affording
them
innocent
amusement
and
we
should
be
as
much
surprised
at
seeing
their
works
introduced
into
that
region
of
asceticism
the
english
as
if
we
ran
across
one
of
madonnas
in
a
baptist
chapel
i
had
the
good
fortune
many
years
ago
to
be
present
at
the
lessons
given
by
a
very
excellent
teacher
to
the
youngest
class
consisting
both
of
boys
and
girls
at
the
first
of
leipzig
in
saxony
the
schooling
which
the
state
demands
for
each
child
begins
at
six
years
old
and
lasts
till
fourteen
these
children
were
therefore
between
six
and
seven
in
one
year
a
certain
vater
taught
them
to
read
write
and
reckon
his
method
of
teaching
was
as
follows
child
had
a
book
with
pictures
of
objects
such
as
a
hat
a
slate
under
the
picture
was
the
name
of
the
object
in
printing
and
writing
characters
and
also
a
couplet
about
the
object
the
children
having
opened
their
books
and
found
the
picture
of
a
hat
the
teacher
showed
them
a
hat
and
told
them
a
tale
connected
with
one
he
then
asked
the
children
questions
about
his
story
and
about
the
hat
he
had
in
his
was
the
colour
of
it
he
then
drew
a
hat
on
the
blackboard
and
made
the
children
copy
it
on
their
slates
next
he
wrote
the
word
and
told
them
that
for
people
who
could
read
this
did
as
well
as
the
picture
the
children
then
copied
the
word
on
their
slates
the
teacher
proceeded
to
analyse
the
word
is
made
up
said
he
three
sounds
the
most
important
of
which
is
the
which
comes
in
the
in
all
cases
the
vowel
sound
was
first
ascertained
in
every
syllable
and
then
was
given
an
approximation
to
consonantal
sounds
before
and
after
the
couplet
was
now
read
by
the
teacher
and
the
children
repeated
it
after
him
in
this
way
the
book
had
to
be
worked
over
and
over
till
the
children
were
perfectly
familiar
with
everything
in
it
they
had
been
already
six
months
thus
employed
when
i
visited
the
school
and
knew
the
book
pretty
thoroughly
to
test
their
knowledge
vater
first
wrote
a
number
of
capitals
at
random
on
the
board
and
called
out
a
boy
to
tell
him
words
having
these
capitals
as
initials
this
boy
had
to
call
out
a
girl
to
do
something
of
the
kind
she
a
boy
and
so
forth
everything
was
done
very
smartly
both
by
master
and
children
the
best
proof
i
saw
of
their
accuracy
and
quickness
was
this
the
master
traced
words
from
the
book
very
rapidly
with
a
stick
on
the
blackboard
and
the
children
always
called
out
the
right
word
though
i
could
not
follow
him
he
also
wrote
with
chalk
words
which
the
children
had
never
seen
and
made
them
name
first
the
vowel
sounds
then
the
consonantal
then
combine
them
i
have
been
thus
minute
in
my
description
of
this
lesson
because
it
seems
to
me
an
admirable
example
of
the
way
in
which
children
between
six
and
eight
years
of
age
should
be
taught
the
method
see
also
published
by
orell
füssli
zürich
was
arranged
and
the
book
prepared
by
the
late
vogel
who
was
then
director
of
the
school
its
merits
as
its
author
pointed
out
to
me
are
that
it
connects
the
instruction
with
objects
of
which
the
child
has
already
an
idea
in
his
mind
and
so
associates
new
knowledge
with
old
that
it
gives
the
children
plenty
to
as
well
as
to
learn
a
point
on
which
the
doctor
was
very
emphatic
that
it
makes
the
children
go
over
the
same
matter
in
various
ways
till
they
have
a
little
and
then
applies
their
knowledge
to
the
acquirement
of
more
here
the
doctor
seems
to
have
followed
jacotot
but
though
the
method
was
no
doubt
a
good
one
i
must
say
its
success
at
leipzig
was
due
at
least
as
much
to
vater
as
to
vogel
this
gentleman
had
been
taking
the
youngest
class
in
this
school
for
twenty
years
and
whether
by
practice
or
natural
talent
he
had
acquired
precisely
the
right
manner
for
keeping
attention
he
was
energetic
without
bustle
and
excitement
and
quiet
without
a
suspicion
of
dulness
or
apathy
by
frequently
changing
the
employment
of
the
class
and
requiring
smartness
in
everything
that
was
done
he
kept
them
all
on
the
alert
the
lesson
i
have
described
was
followed
without
pause
by
one
in
arithmetic
the
two
together
occupying
an
hour
and
three
quarters
and
the
interest
of
the
children
never
flagged
throughout
method
for
arithmetic
i
can
not
now
recall
but
i
do
not
doubt
that
as
a
german
teacher
who
had
studied
his
profession
he
understood
what
english
teachers
and
do
not
understand
how
children
should
get
their
first
knowledge
of
numbers
pestalozzi
and
froebel
insisted
that
children
should
learn
about
numbers
from
which
they
actually
counted
and
according
to
method
which
i
found
in
germany
over
years
ago
and
which
is
now
extending
to
the
united
states
the
whole
of
the
first
year
is
given
to
the
relations
of
numbers
not
exceeding
ten
see
by
seeley
new
york
kellogg
and
chicago
in
arithmetic
everything
depends
on
these
relations
becoming
thoroughly
familiar
the
decimal
scale
is
possibly
not
so
good
as
the
scale
of
eight
or
of
twelve
but
the
human
race
has
adopted
it
and
even
the
french
revolutionists
with
all
their
belief
in
and
their
hatred
of
the
past
recoiled
from
any
attempt
to
change
it
but
in
accepting
it
they
endeavoured
to
remove
anomalies
and
so
should
we
everything
must
be
based
on
groups
of
ten
and
with
children
we
should
do
well
as
wooding
suggests
to
avoid
the
great
anomaly
in
our
nomenclature
and
call
the
numbers
between
ten
and
twenty
or
numeration
should
by
a
long
way
precede
any
kind
of
notation
and
the
main
truths
about
numbers
should
be
got
at
experimentally
with
counters
or
coins
in
these
truths
should
be
included
all
that
we
usually
separate
under
the
four
rules
and
with
integers
we
may
even
from
the
first
give
a
clear
conception
of
the
fractional
parts
of
whole
numbers
that
one
third
of
is
actual
measuring
and
weighing
besides
actual
counting
go
towards
actual
arithmetic
for
children
all
this
teaching
if
conducted
as
vater
would
have
conducted
it
would
not
give
children
any
distaste
for
learning
or
make
them
dread
the
sound
of
the
school
bell
i
will
suppose
a
child
to
have
passed
through
such
a
course
as
this
by
the
time
he
is
eight
or
nine
years
old
besides
having
some
clear
notions
of
number
and
form
he
can
now
read
and
copy
easy
words
what
we
next
want
for
him
is
a
series
of
good
about
things
in
which
he
takes
an
interest
the
language
must
of
course
be
simple
but
the
matter
so
good
that
neither
master
nor
pupils
will
be
disgusted
by
its
frequent
repetition
the
first
volume
may
very
well
be
about
horses
of
which
large
pictures
should
be
provided
illustrating
the
text
the
first
cost
of
these
pictures
would
be
considerable
but
as
they
would
last
for
years
the
expense
to
the
friends
of
each
child
taught
from
them
would
be
a
mere
trifle
the
books
placed
in
the
hands
of
the
children
should
be
well
printed
and
strongly
bound
in
the
present
system
are
given
out
in
cloth
and
the
leaves
are
loose
at
the
end
of
a
fortnight
so
that
children
get
accustomed
to
their
destruction
and
treat
it
as
a
matter
of
course
this
ruins
their
respect
for
books
which
is
not
so
unimportant
a
matter
as
it
may
at
first
appear
after
each
reading
lesson
which
should
contain
at
least
one
interesting
anecdote
there
should
be
columns
of
all
the
words
which
occurred
for
the
first
time
in
that
lesson
these
should
be
arranged
according
to
their
grammatical
classification
not
that
the
child
should
be
taught
grammar
but
this
order
is
as
good
as
any
other
and
by
it
the
child
would
learn
to
observe
certain
differences
in
words
almost
unconsciously
here
i
can
not
resist
quoting
an
excellent
remark
from
should
make
the
greatest
progress
in
art
science
politics
and
morals
if
we
could
train
up
our
minds
to
look
straight
and
steadfastly
and
uninterruptedly
at
the
thing
in
question
that
we
are
observing
this
seems
a
very
slight
thing
to
do
but
practically
it
is
hardly
ever
done
between
you
and
the
object
rises
a
mist
of
technicalities
of
prejudices
of
previous
knowledge
and
above
all
of
terrible
perhaps
it
is
this
that
has
prevented
our
seeing
till
quite
lately
that
reading
is
the
art
of
getting
meaning
by
signs
that
appeal
to
the
eye
the
art
of
reporting
to
others
the
meaning
we
have
thus
arrived
at
boys
to
read
aloud
what
they
do
not
first
understand
says
benjamin
franklin
the
cause
of
those
even
set
tones
so
common
among
readers
which
when
they
have
once
got
a
habit
of
using
them
they
find
so
difficult
to
correct
by
which
means
among
fifty
readers
we
scarcely
find
a
good
sk
of
english
it
seems
to
have
escaped
even
sagacity
that
reading
aloud
is
a
different
art
to
the
art
of
reading
and
a
much
harder
one
the
two
should
be
studied
separately
and
most
time
and
attention
should
be
given
to
silent
reading
which
is
by
far
the
more
important
of
the
two
colonel
parker
who
has
successfully

and

agonising
pronunciation

have
heard

many
times
in
the
is
a
terrible
sin
that
we
should
never
be
guilty
of
there
is
indeed
not
the
slightest
need
of
changing
a
good
habit
to
a
miserable
one
if
we
would
follow
the
rule
that
the
child
has
naturally
followed
all
his
life
allow
a
child
to
give
a
thought
till
he
gets
now
that
the
existence
of
a
thought
in
children
is
allowed
for
we
may
expect
all
sorts
of
improvements
reading
as
a
means
of
ascertaining
thought
is
second
only
to
hearing
and
this
art
should
be
cultivated
by
giving
children
books
of
questions
horace
for
young
and
requiring
the
learner
silently
to
get
at
the
question
and
then
give
the
answer
aloud
easy
descriptive
and
narrative
poetry
should
be
learnt
by
heart
at
this
stage
that
the
children
may
repeat
it
well
they
should
get
their
first
notions
of
it
from
the
master
according
to
the
usual
plan
they
get
it
up
with
false
emphasis
and
false
stops
and
the
more
thoroughly
they
have
learnt
the
piece
the
more
difficulty
the
master
has
in
making
them
say
it
properly
every
lesson
should
be
worked
over
in
various
ways
the
columns
of
words
at
the
end
of
the
reading
lessons
may
be
printed
with
writing
characters
and
used
for
copies
to
write
an
upright
column
either
of
words
or
figures
is
an
excellent
exercise
in
neatness
the
columns
will
also
be
used
as
spelling
lessons
and
the
children
may
be
questioned
about
the
meaning
of
the
words
the
poetry
when
thoroughly
learned
may
sometimes
be
written
from
memory
sentences
from
the
book
may
be
copied
either
directly
or
from
the
and
afterwards
used
for
dictation
boys
should
as
soon
as
possible
be
accustomed
to
write
out
fables
or
the
substance
of
other
reading
lessons
in
their
own
words
they
may
also
write
descriptions
of
things
with
which
they
are
familiar
or
any
event
which
has
recently
happened
such
as
a
country
excursion
every
one
feels
the
necessity
on
grounds
of
practical
utility
at
all
events
of
boys
being
taught
to
express
their
thoughts
neatly
on
paper
in
good
english
and
with
correct
spelling
yet
this
is
a
point
rarely
reached
before
the
age
of
fifteen
or
sixteen
often
never
reached
at
all
the
reason
is
that
written
exercises
must
be
carefully
looked
over
by
the
master
or
they
are
done
in
a
slovenly
manner
anyone
who
has
never
taught
in
a
school
will
say
let
the
master
carefully
look
them
but
the
expenditure
of
time
and
trouble
this
involves
on
the
master
is
so
great
that
in
the
end
he
is
pretty
sure
either
to
have
few
exercises
written
or
to
neglect
to
look
them
over
the
only
remedy
is
for
the
master
not
to
have
many
boys
to
teach
and
not
to
be
many
hours
in
school
even
then
unless
he
set
apart
a
special
time
every
day
for
correcting
exercises
he
is
likely
to
find
them
upon
the
course
of
accompanied
by
large
illustrations
may
go
on
to
many
other
things
which
the
children
see
around
them
such
as
trees
and
plants
and
so
lead
up
to
instruction
in
natural
history
and
physiology
but
in
imparting
all
knowledge
of
this
kind
we
should
aim
not
at
getting
the
children
to
remember
a
number
of
facts
but
at
opening
their
eyes
and
extending
the
range
of
their
interests
i
should
suggest
then
for
children
three
books
to
be
used
concurrently
a
reading
book
about
animals
and
things
a
poetry
book
and
a
prose
narrative
or
fables
with
the
first
commences
a
series
culminating
in
works
of
science
with
the
second
a
series
that
should
lead
up
to
milton
and
shakespeare
the
third
should
be
succeeded
by
some
of
our
best
writers
in
prose
but
many
schoolmasters
will
shudder
at
the
thought
of
a
spending
a
year
or
two
at
school
without
ever
hearing
of
the
heptarchy
or
magna
charta
and
without
knowing
the
names
of
the
great
towns
in
any
country
of
europe
i
confess
i
regard
this
ignorance
with
great
equanimity
if
the
child
or
the
youth
even
takes
no
interest
in
the
heptarchy
and
magna
charta
and
knows
nothing
of
the
towns
but
their
names
i
think
him
quite
as
well
off
without
this
knowledge
as
with
better
as
such
knowledge
turns
the
lad
into
a
as
carlyle
might
say
and
gives
him
the
appearance
of
being
without
the
reality
but
i
neither
despise
a
knowledge
of
history
and
geography
nor
do
i
think
that
these
studies
should
be
neglected
for
foreign
languages
or
science
and
it
is
because
i
should
wish
a
pupil
of
mine
to
become
in
the
end
thoroughly
conversant
in
history
and
geography
that
i
should
if
possible
conceal
from
him
the
existence
of
the
numerous
school
manuals
on
these
subjects
we
will
suppose
that
a
parent
meets
with
a
book
which
he
thinks
will
be
both
instructive
and
entertaining
to
his
children
but
the
book
is
a
large
one
and
would
take
a
long
time
to
get
through
so
instead
of
reading
any
part
of
it
to
them
or
letting
them
read
it
for
themselves
he
makes
them
by
heart
the
table
of
the
children
do
find
it
entertaining
they
get
a
horror
of
the
book
which
prevents
their
ever
looking
at
it
afterwards
and
they
forget
what
they
have
learnt
as
soon
as
they
possibly
can
just
such
is
the
sagacious
plan
adopted
in
teaching
history
and
geography
in
schools
and
such
are
the
natural
consequences
every
student
knows
that
the
use
of
an
epitome
is
to
knowledge
not
to
communicate
it
and
yet
in
teaching
we
give
the
epitome
first
and
allow
it
to
precede
or
rather
to
supplant
the
knowledge
epitomised
the
children
are
disgusted
and
no
wonder
the
subjects
indeed
are
interesting
but
not
so
the
epitomes
i
suppose
if
we
could
see
the
skeletons
of
the
gunnings
we
should
not
find
them
more
fascinating
than
any
other
skeletons
the
first
thing
to
be
aimed
at
then
is
to
excite
the
interest
even
if
we
thought
of
nothing
but
the
acquiring
of
information
this
is
clearly
the
true
method
what
are
the
facts
which
we
remember
those
in
which
we
feel
an
interest
if
we
are
told
that
has
met
with
an
accident
or
failed
in
business
we
forget
it
directly
unless
we
know
the
person
spoken
of
similarly
if
i
read
anything
about
addison
or
goldsmith
it
interests
me
and
i
remember
it
because
they
are
so
to
speak
friends
of
mine
but
the
same
information
about
sir
richard
blackmore
or
cumberland
would
not
stay
in
my
head
for
hours
so
again
we
naturally
retain
anything
we
learn
about
a
foreign
country
in
which
a
relation
has
settled
but
it
would
require
some
little
trouble
to
commit
to
memory
the
same
facts
about
a
place
in
which
we
had
no
concern
all
this
proceeds
from
two
causes
first
that
the
mind
retains
that
in
which
it
takes
an
interest
and
secondly
that
one
of
the
principal
helps
to
memory
is
the
association
of
ideas
these
were
no
doubt
the
ground
reasons
which
influenced
arnold
in
framing
his
plan
of
a
first
history
book
this
book
he
says
should
be
a
of
the
memorable
deeds
which
would
best
appeal
to
the
imagination
they
should
be
arranged
in
order
of
time
but
with
no
other
connection
the
should
simply
but
fully
tell
the
of
the
action
depicted
these
would
form
of
interest
the
child
would
be
curious
to
know
more
about
the
great
men
whose
acquaintance
he
had
made
and
would
associate
with
them
the
scenes
of
their
exploits
and
thus
we
might
actually
find
our
children
anxious
to
learn
history
and
geography
i
am
sorry
that
even
the
great
authority
of
arnold
has
not
availed
to
bring
this
method
into
use
such
a
book
would
of
course
be
dear
bad
pictures
are
worse
than
none
at
all
and
goethe
tells
us
that
his
appreciation
of
homer
was
for
years
destroyed
by
his
having
been
shown
when
a
child
absurd
pictures
of
the
homeric
heroes
the
book
would
therefore
cost
six
or
eight
shillings
at
least
and
who
would
give
this
sum
for
an
account
of
single
actions
of
a
few
great
men
when
he
might
buy
the
lives
of
all
great
men
together
with
ancient
and
modern
history
the
names
of
the
planets
and
a
great
amount
of
miscellaneous
information
all
for
a
shilling
in
however
if
the
saving
of
a
few
shillings
is
more
to
be
thought
of
than
the
best
method
of
instruction
the
subject
hardly
deserves
our
serious
consideration
it
is
much
to
be
regretted
that
books
for
the
young
are
so
seldom
written
by
distinguished
authors
i
suppose
that
of
the
three
things
which
the
author
seeks
money
reputation
influence
the
first
is
not
often
despised
nor
the
last
considered
the
least
valuable
and
yet
both
money
and
influence
are
more
certainly
gained
by
a
good
book
for
the
young
than
by
any
other
the
influence
of
brown
however
different
in
kind
is
probably
not
smaller
in
amount
than
that
of
what
we
want
is
a
macaulay
for
boys
who
shall
handle
historical
subjects
with
that
wonderful
art
displayed
in
the
art
of
elaborating
all
the
more
telling
portions
of
the
subject
outlining
the
rest
and
suppressing
everything
that
does
not
conduce
to
heighten
the
general
effect
some
of
these
essays
such
as
the
and
will
be
read
with
avidity
by
the
elder
boys
but
macaulay
did
not
write
for
children
and
he
abounds
in
words
to
them
unintelligible
had
he
been
a
married
man
we
might
perhaps
have
had
such
a
volume
of
historical
sketches
for
boys
as
now
we
must
wish
for
in
vain
but
there
are
good
left
among
us
and
we
might
soon
expect
such
books
as
we
desiderate
if
it
were
clearly
understood
what
is
the
right
sort
of
book
and
if
men
of
literary
ability
and
experience
would
condescend
to
write
them
if
in
these
latter
days
individual
withers
and
the
world
is
more
and
more
we
must
not
expect
our
children
to
enter
into
this
their
sympathy
and
their
imagination
can
be
aroused
not
for
nations
but
for
individuals
and
this
is
the
reason
why
some
biographies
of
great
men
should
precede
any
history
these
should
be
written
after
method
there
should
be
no
attempt
at
completeness
but
what
is
most
important
and
interesting
about
the
man
should
be
narrated
in
detail
and
the
rest
lightly
sketched
or
omitted
altogether
painters
understand
this
principle
and
in
taking
a
portrait
very
often
depict
a
features
minutely
without
telling
all
the
truth
about
the
buttons
on
his
waistcoat
but
because
in
a
literary
picture
each
touch
takes
up
additional
space
writers
seem
to
fear
that
the
picture
will
be
distorted
unless
every
particular
is
expanded
or
condensed
in
the
same
ratio
at
the
risk
of
wearisome
repetition
i
must
again
say
that
i
care
as
little
about
driving
into
a
boy
as
the
most
ultra
cambridge
man
could
wish
but
i
want
to
get
the
boy
to
have
wide
sympathies
and
to
teach
himself
and
i
should
therefore
select
the
great
men
from
very
different
periods
and
countries
that
his
net
of
interest
so
to
speak
may
be
spread
in
all
waters
when
we
have
thus
got
our
boys
to
form
the
acquaintance
of
great
men
they
will
have
certain
associations
connected
with
many
towns
and
countries
constant
reference
should
be
made
to
the
map
and
the
knowledge
and
interest
will
thus
make
settlements
in
different
parts
of
the
globe
these
may
be
extended
by
a
good
book
of
travels
especially
of
voyages
of
discovery
there
are
now
many
such
books
suitable
for
the
purpose
but
i
am
still
partial
to
a
book
which
has
been
a
delight
to
me
and
to
my
own
children
from
our
earliest
years
evenings
or
tales
of
or
as
routledge
now
calls
a
part
of
it
in
hot
and
cold
in
studying
such
travels
the
map
should
of
course
be
always
in
sight
and
outline
maps
may
be
filled
up
by
the
boys
as
they
learn
about
the
places
in
the
route
anyone
who
has
had
the
management
of
a
school
library
knows
how
popular
and
is
with
the
boys
who
have
passed
the
stage
in
which
the
of
animals
were
the
main
attraction
captain
cook
mungo
park
and
admiral
byron
are
heroes
without
whom
boyhood
would
be
incomplete
but
as
boys
are
engrossed
by
the
adventures
and
never
trouble
themselves
about
the
map
they
often
remember
the
incidents
without
knowing
where
they
happened
of
course
school
geographies
never
mention
such
people
as
celebrated
travellers
if
they
did
it
would
be
impossible
to
give
all
the
principal
geographical
names
in
the
world
within
the
compass
of
pages
what
might
we
fairly
expect
from
such
a
course
of
teaching
as
i
have
here
suggested
at
the
end
of
a
year
and
a
half
or
two
years
from
the
age
say
of
nine
the
boy
would
read
to
himself
intelligently
he
would
write
fairly
he
would
spell
all
common
english
words
correctly
he
would
be
thoroughly
familiar
with
the
relations
of
all
common
numbers
that
is
of
all
numbers
below
he
would
have
had
his
interest
aroused
or
to
speak
more
accurately
not
stifled
but
increased
in
common
objects
such
as
animals
trees
and
plants
he
would
have
made
the
acquaintance
of
some
great
men
and
traced
the
voyages
of
some
great
travellers
he
would
be
able
to
say
by
heart
and
to
write
from
memory
some
of
the
best
simple
english
poetry
and
his
ear
would
be
familiar
with
the
sound
of
good
english
prose
so
much
at
least
on
the
positive
side
on
the
negative
there
might
also
be
results
of
considerable
value
he
would
have
learned
to
look
upon
books
and
as
the
torment
of
his
life
nor
have
fallen
into
the
habit
of
giving
them
as
little
of
his
attention
as
he
could
reconcile
with
immunity
from
the
cane
the
benefit
of
the
negative
result
might
outweigh
a
very
glib
knowledge
of
and
latin
grammar
xxi
the
moral
and
religious
influence
all
who
are
acquainted
with
the
standard
treatises
on
the
theory
of
education
and
also
with
the
management
of
schools
will
have
observed
that
moral
and
religious
training
occupies
a
larger
and
more
prominent
space
in
theory
than
in
practice
on
consideration
we
shall
find
perhaps
that
this
might
naturally
be
expected
of
course
we
are
all
agreed
that
morality
is
more
important
than
learning
and
masters
who
are
many
of
them
clergymen
will
hardly
be
accused
of
the
value
of
religion
why
then
does
not
moral
and
religious
training
receive
a
larger
share
of
the
attention
the
reason
i
take
to
be
this
experience
shows
that
it
depends
directly
on
the
master
whether
a
boy
acquires
knowledge
but
only
indirectly
and
in
a
much
less
degree
whether
he
grows
up
a
good
and
religious
man
the
aim
which
engrosses
most
of
our
time
is
likely
to
absorb
an
equal
share
of
our
interest
and
thus
it
happens
that
masters
especially
those
who
never
associate
on
terms
of
intimacy
with
their
pupils
out
of
school
throw
energy
enough
into
making
boys
but
seldom
think
at
all
of
the
development
of
their
character
or
about
their
thoughts
and
feelings
in
matters
of
religion
this
statement
may
indeed
be
exaggerated
but
no
one
who
has
the
means
of
judging
will
assert
that
it
is
altogether
without
foundation
and
yet
although
a
master
can
be
more
certain
of
sending
out
his
pupils
than
his
influence
on
their
character
is
much
greater
than
it
might
appear
to
a
superficial
observer
i
am
not
speaking
of
formal
religious
instruction
i
refer
now
to
the
indirect
influence
the
results
of
his
formal
teaching
vary
as
its
amount
but
he
can
apply
no
such
gauge
to
his
informal
teaching
a
few
words
of
earnest
advice
or
remonstrance
which
a
boy
hears
at
the
right
time
from
a
man
whom
he
respects
may
affect
that
character
for
life
here
everything
depends
not
on
the
words
used
but
on
the
feeling
with
which
they
are
spoken
and
on
the
way
in
which
the
speaker
is
regarded
by
the
hearer
in
such
matters
the
master
has
a
much
more
delicate
and
difficult
task
than
in
mere
instruction
the
words
indeed
are
soon
spoken
but
that
which
gives
them
their
influence
is
not
soon
or
easily
acquired
here
as
in
so
many
other
instances
we
may
in
a
few
minutes
throw
down
what
it
has
cost
us
build
up
an
unkind
word
will
destroy
the
effects
of
kindness
boys
always
form
their
opinion
of
a
man
from
the
worst
they
know
of
him
experience
has
not
yet
taught
them
that
good
people
have
their
failings
and
bad
people
their
virtues
if
the
scholars
find
the
master
at
times
harsh
and
testy
they
can
not
believe
in
his
kindness
of
heart
and
care
for
their
welfare
they
do
not
see
that
he
may
have
an
ideal
before
him
to
which
he
is
partly
though
not
wholly
true
they
judge
him
by
his
demeanour
in
his
least
guarded
times
when
he
is
jaded
and
dissatisfied
with
the
result
of
his
labours
at
such
times
he
is
no
longer
with
his
pupils
he
is
conscious
only
of
his
own
power
and
mental
superiority
feeling
almost
a
contempt
for
the
weakness
he
does
not
care
for
their
opinion
of
him
or
think
for
an
instant
what
impression
he
is
making
by
his
words
and
conduct
he
gives
full
play
to
his
and
says
or
does
something
which
seems
to
the
boys
to
reveal
him
in
his
true
character
and
which
causes
them
ever
after
to
distrust
his
kindness
when
we
consider
the
way
in
which
masters
endeavour
to
gain
influence
we
shall
find
that
they
may
be
divided
roughly
into
two
parties
whom
i
will
call
the
open
and
the
reserved
a
teacher
of
the
party
endeavours
to
appear
to
his
pupils
precisely
as
he
is
he
will
hear
of
no
restraint
except
that
of
decorum
he
believes
that
if
he
is
as
much
the
superior
of
his
pupils
as
he
ought
to
be
his
authority
will
take
care
of
itself
without
his
casting
round
it
a
wall
of
artificial
reserve
natural
he
says
rid
of
affectations
and
shams
of
all
kinds
and
then
if
there
is
any
good
in
you
it
will
tell
on
those
around
you
whatever
is
bad
would
be
felt
just
as
surely
in
disguise
and
the
disguise
would
only
be
an
additional
source
of
the
on
the
other
hand
wish
their
pupils
to
think
of
them
as
they
ought
to
be
rather
than
as
they
are
against
the
other
party
they
urge
that
our
words
and
actions
can
not
always
be
in
harmony
with
our
thoughts
and
feelings
however
much
we
may
desire
to
make
them
so
we
must
therefore
they
say
reconcile
ourselves
to
this
and
since
our
words
and
actions
are
more
under
our
control
than
our
thoughts
and
feelings
we
must
make
them
as
nearly
as
possible
what
they
should
be
instead
of
debasing
them
to
involuntary
thoughts
and
feelings
which
are
not
worthy
of
us
then
again
a
teacher
who
is
an
idealist
may
say
young
require
some
one
to
look
up
to
in
my
better
moments
i
am
not
altogether
unworthy
of
their
respect
but
if
they
knew
all
my
weaknesses
they
would
naturally
and
perhaps
justly
despise
me
for
their
sakes
therefore
i
must
keep
my
weaknesses
out
of
sight
and
the
effort
to
do
this
demands
a
certain
reserve
in
all
our
i
suppose
an
excess
in
either
direction
might
lead
to
mischievous
results
the
man
might
be
wanting
in
and
might
say
and
do
things
which
though
not
wrong
in
themselves
might
have
a
bad
effect
on
the
young
then
again
the
lower
and
more
worldly
side
of
his
character
might
show
itself
in
too
strong
relief
and
his
pupils
seeing
this
mainly
and
supposing
that
they
understood
him
entirely
might
disbelieve
in
his
higher
motives
and
religious
feeling
on
the
other
hand
those
who
set
up
for
being
better
than
they
really
are
are
as
it
were
walking
on
stilts
they
gain
no
real
influence
by
their
separation
from
their
pupils
and
they
are
always
liable
to
an
accident
which
may
expose
them
to
their
ridicule
i
am
therefore
though
with
some
limitation
in
favour
of
the
school
i
am
well
aware
however
what
an
immense
demand
this
system
makes
on
the
master
who
desires
to
exercise
a
good
influence
on
the
moral
and
religious
character
of
his
pupils
if
he
would
have
his
pupils
know
him
as
he
is
if
he
would
have
them
think
as
he
thinks
feel
as
he
feels
and
believe
as
he
believes
he
must
be
at
least
in
heart
and
aim
worthy
of
their
imitation
he
must
with
reverence
be
it
spoken
enter
in
his
humble
way
into
the
spirit
of
the
perfect
teacher
who
said
their
sakes
i
sanctify
myself
that
they
also
may
be
sanctified
in
are
we
prepared
to
look
upon
our
calling
in
this
light
i
believe
that
the
of
this
country
need
not
fear
comparison
with
any
other
body
of
men
in
point
of
morality
and
religious
earnestness
but
i
dare
say
many
have
found
as
i
have
that
the
occupation
is
a
very
one
that
the
teacher
soon
gets
to
work
in
a
groove
and
from
having
his
thoughts
so
much
occupied
with
routine
work
especially
with
small
and
small
corrections
he
is
apt
to
settle
down
insensibly
into
a
kind
of
moral
and
intellectual
as
matthew
arnold
has
taught
us
to
call
which
he
cares
as
little
for
high
aims
and
general
principles
as
his
most
commonplace
pupil
thus
it
happens
sometimes
that
a
man
who
set
out
with
the
notion
of
developing
all
the
powers
of
his
minds
thinks
in
the
end
of
nothing
but
getting
them
to
work
out
equations
and
do
latin
exercises
without
false
concords
and
the
clergyman
even
who
began
with
a
strong
sense
of
his
responsibility
and
a
confident
hope
of
influencing
the
belief
and
character
at
length
is
quite
content
if
they
conform
to
discipline
and
give
him
no
trouble
out
of
we
may
say
of
a
really
good
teacher
what
wordsworth
says
of
the
poet
in
his
work
he
must
neither
lack
that
first
great
gift
the
vital
soul
nor
general
truths
which
are
themselves
a
sort
of
elements
and
agents
subordinate
helpers
of
the
living
i
but
the
is
too
often
crushed
by
excessive
routine
labour
and
then
when
general
truths
both
moral
and
intellectual
have
ceased
to
interest
us
our
own
education
stops
and
we
become
incapable
of
fulfilling
the
highest
and
most
important
part
of
our
duty
in
educating
others
it
is
then
the
duty
of
the
teacher
to
resist
gravitating
into
this
state
no
less
for
his
sake
than
for
his
own
the
ways
and
means
of
doing
this
i
am
by
no
means
competent
to
point
out
so
i
will
merely
insist
on
the
importance
of
teachers
not
being
matter
which
has
not
i
think
hitherto
received
due
attention
we
can
not
expect
intellectual
activity
of
men
whose
minds
are
compelled
constancy
to
keep
the
hour
after
hour
till
they
are
too
jaded
for
exertion
of
any
kind
the
man
himself
suffers
and
his
work
even
his
easiest
work
suffers
also
it
may
be
laid
down
as
a
general
rule
that
no
one
can
teach
long
and
teach
well
all
satisfactory
teaching
and
management
of
boys
absolutely
requires
that
the
master
should
be
good
when
the
spirits
fail
as
they
must
from
an
overdose
of
monotonous
work
everything
goes
wrong
directly
the
master
has
no
longer
the
power
of
keeping
the
attention
and
has
to
resort
to
punishments
even
to
preserve
order
his
gloom
quenches
their
interest
and
mental
activity
just
as
fire
goes
out
before
carbonic
acid
and
in
the
end
teacher
and
taught
acquire
not
without
cause
a
feeling
of
mutual
aversion
and
another
reason
why
the
master
should
not
spend
the
greater
part
of
his
time
in
formal
teaching
is
doing
so
compels
him
to
neglect
the
informal
but
very
important
teaching
he
may
both
give
and
receive
by
making
his
pupils
his
companions
i
fear
i
shall
be
met
here
by
an
objection
which
has
only
too
much
force
in
it
most
englishmen
are
at
a
loss
how
to
make
any
use
of
leisure
if
a
man
has
no
turn
for
thinking
no
fondness
for
reading
and
is
without
a
hobby
what
good
shall
his
leisure
do
him
he
will
only
pass
it
in
insipid
gossip
from
which
any
easy
work
would
be
a
relief
that
this
is
so
in
many
cases
is
a
proof
to
my
mind
of
the
utter
failure
of
our
ordinary
education
and
perhaps
an
improved
education
may
some
day
alter
what
now
seems
a
national
peculiarity
meantime
the
mind
even
of
englishmen
is
more
than
a
for
salt
and
its
tendency
to
bury
its
sight
under
a
heap
of
routine
work
must
be
strenuously
resisted
if
it
is
to
escape
its
deadly
enemies
stupidity
and
ignorance
i
have
elsewhere
expressed
what
i
believe
is
the
common
conviction
of
those
who
have
seen
something
both
of
large
schools
and
of
small
that
the
moral
atmosphere
of
the
former
is
as
a
rule
by
far
the
more
wholesome
and
also
that
each
boy
is
more
influenced
by
his
companions
than
by
his
master
more
than
this
i
believe
that
in
many
perhaps
in
most
schools
one
or
two
boys
affect
the
tone
of
the
whole
body
more
than
any
master
what
are
called
preparatory
schools
labour
under
this
immense
disadvantage
that
their
ruling
spirits
are
mere
children
without
reflection
or
sense
of
responsibility
but
where
the
leading
boys
are
virtually
young
men
these
may
be
made
a
medium
through
which
the
mind
of
the
master
may
act
upon
the
whole
school
they
can
enter
into
the
thoughts
feelings
and
aims
of
the
master
on
the
one
hand
and
they
know
what
is
said
and
done
among
the
boys
on
the
other
the
master
must
therefore
know
the
elder
boys
intimately
and
they
must
know
him
this
consummation
however
will
not
be
arrived
at
without
great
tact
and
on
the
part
of
the
master
the
youth
who
is
man
nor
is
apt
to
be
shy
and
awkward
and
is
not
by
any
means
so
easy
to
entertain
as
the
lad
who
chatters
freely
of
the
cricket
or
football
past
present
and
to
come
but
the
master
who
feels
how
is
the
of
the
school
will
not
grudge
any
pains
to
influence
those
on
whom
it
chiefly
depends
but
allowing
the
value
of
all
these
indirect
influences
can
we
afford
to
neglect
direct
formal
religious
instruction
we
have
most
of
us
the
greatest
horror
of
what
we
call
a
secular
education
meaning
thereby
an
education
without
formal
religious
teaching
but
this
horror
seems
to
affect
our
theory
more
than
our
practice
few
parents
ever
enquire
what
religious
instruction
their
sons
get
at
eton
harrow
or
westminster
at
harrow
when
i
was
in
the
fourth
form
there
nearly
fifty
years
ago
by
the
way
we
had
no
religious
instruction
except
a
weekly
lesson
in
scripture
history
and
when
i
was
a
master
some
twenty
years
ago
my
form
had
only
a
sunday
lesson
in
a
portion
of
the
old
testament
and
a
lesson
in
french
testament
at
on
monday
even
in
some
we
do
not
find
made
so
much
of
as
the
arithmetic
in
this
matter
we
differ
very
widely
from
the
germans
all
their
classes
have
a
nearly
every
day
the
younger
children
in
the
german
bible
the
elder
in
the
greek
testament
or
church
history
and
in
all
cases
the
teacher
is
careful
to
instruct
his
pupils
in
the
tenets
of
luther
or
calvin
the
germans
may
urge
that
if
we
believe
a
set
of
doctrines
to
be
a
fitting
expression
of
divine
revelation
it
is
our
first
duty
to
make
the
young
familiar
with
those
doctrines
i
can
not
say
however
that
i
have
been
favourably
impressed
by
the
i
have
heard
given
in
german
schools
i
do
not
deny
that
dogmatic
teaching
is
necessary
but
the
first
thing
to
cultivate
in
the
young
is
reverence
and
reverence
is
surely
in
danger
if
you
take
a
class
in
just
as
you
take
a
class
in
grammar
emerson
says
somewhere
that
to
the
poet
the
saint
and
the
philosopher
all
distinction
of
sacred
and
profane
ceases
to
exist
all
things
become
alike
sacred
as
the
schoolboy
however
does
not
as
yet
come
under
any
one
of
these
denominations
if
the
distinction
ceases
to
exist
for
him
all
things
will
become
alike
profane
i
believe
that
religious
instruction
is
conveyed
in
the
most
impressive
way
when
it
is
connected
with
worship
where
the
prayers
are
joined
with
the
reading
of
scripture
and
with
occasional
simple
addresses
and
where
the
congregation
have
responses
to
repeat
and
psalms
and
hymns
to
sing
there
is
reason
to
hope
that
boys
will
increase
not
only
in
knowledge
but
in
wisdom
and
reverence
too
without
asserting
that
the
church
of
england
service
is
the
best
possible
for
the
young
i
hold
that
any
form
for
them
should
at
least
resemble
it
in
its
main
features
should
be
as
varied
as
possible
should
require
frequent
change
of
posture
and
should
give
the
congregation
much
to
say
and
sing
much
use
might
be
made
as
in
the
church
of
rome
of
litanies
the
service
whatever
its
form
should
be
conducted
with
great
solemnity
and
the
boys
should
not
sit
or
kneel
so
close
together
that
the
badly
disposed
may
disturb
their
neighbours
who
try
to
join
in
the
act
of
worship
if
good
hymns
are
sung
these
may
be
taken
occasionally
as
the
subject
of
an
address
so
that
attention
may
be
drawn
to
their
meaning
music
should
be
carefully
attended
to
and
the
danger
of
irreverence
at
practices
guarded
against
by
never
using
sacred
words
more
than
is
necessary
and
by
impressing
on
the
singers
the
sacredness
of
everything
connected
with
divine
worship
questions
combined
with
instruction
may
sometimes
keep
up
attention
better
than
a
formal
sermon
though
common
prayer
should
be
frequent
this
should
not
be
supposed
to
take
the
place
of
private
prayer
in
many
schools
boys
have
hardly
an
opportunity
for
private
prayer
they
kneel
down
perhaps
with
all
the
talk
and
play
of
their
schoolfellows
going
on
around
them
and
sometimes
fear
of
public
opinion
prevents
their
kneeling
down
at
all
a
schoolmaster
can
not
teach
private
prayer
but
he
can
at
least
see
that
there
is
opportunity
for
it
education
to
goodness
and
piety
as
far
as
it
lies
in
human
hands
must
consist
almost
entirely
in
the
influence
of
the
good
and
pious
superior
over
his
inferiors
and
as
this
influence
is
independent
of
rules
these
remarks
of
mine
can
not
do
more
than
touch
the
surface
of
this
most
important
subject
in
conclusion
i
wish
to
say
a
word
on
the
education
of
opinion
sir
arthur
helps
lays
great
stress
on
preparing
the
way
to
moderation
and
by
teaching
boys
that
all
good
men
are
not
of
the
same
way
of
thinking
it
is
indeed
a
miserable
error
to
lead
a
young
person
to
suppose
that
his
small
ideas
are
a
measure
of
the
universe
and
that
all
who
do
not
accept
his
formularies
are
less
enlightened
than
himself
if
a
young
man
is
so
brought
up
he
either
carries
intellectual
blinkers
all
his
life
or
what
is
far
more
probable
he
finds
that
something
he
has
been
taught
is
false
and
forthwith
begins
to
doubt
everything
on
the
other
hand
it
is
a
necessity
with
the
young
to
believe
and
we
could
not
even
if
we
would
bring
a
youth
into
such
a
state
of
mind
as
to
regard
everything
about
which
there
is
any
variety
of
opinion
as
an
open
question
but
he
may
be
taught
reverence
and
humility
he
may
be
taught
to
reflect
how
infinitely
greater
the
facts
of
the
universe
must
be
than
our
poor
thoughts
about
them
and
how
inadequate
are
words
to
express
even
our
imperfect
thoughts
then
he
will
not
suppose
that
all
truth
has
been
taught
him
in
his
formularies
nor
that
he
understands
even
all
the
truth
of
which
those
formularies
are
the
imperfect
expression
xxii
conclusion
when
i
originally
published
these
essays
more
than
years
ago
the
critic
of
the
in
one
of
the
best
though
by
no
means
most
complimentary
of
the
many
notices
with
which
the
book
was
favoured
took
me
to
task
for
being
in
such
a
hurry
to
publish
i
had
confessed
incompleteness
what
need
was
there
for
me
to
publish
before
i
had
completed
my
work
since
that
time
i
have
spent
years
on
my
subject
and
at
least
two
years
on
these
essays
themselves
but
they
now
seem
to
me
even
further
from
completeness
than
they
seemed
then
however
i
have
reason
to
believe
that
the
old
book
incomplete
as
it
was
proved
useful
to
teachers
and
in
its
altered
form
it
will
i
hope
be
found
useful
still
it
may
be
useful
i
think
in
two
ways
first
it
may
lead
some
teachers
to
the
study
of
the
great
thinkers
on
education
there
are
some
vital
truths
which
remain
in
the
books
which
time
can
not
destroy
in
the
world
as
goethe
says
are
few
voices
many
echoes
and
the
echoes
often
prevent
our
hearing
the
voices
distinctly
perhaps
most
people
had
a
better
chance
of
hearing
the
voices
when
there
were
fewer
books
and
no
periodicals
speakers
properly
so
called
can
not
now
be
heard
for
the
hubbub
of
the
talkers
and
as
literature
is
becoming
more
and
more
periodical
our
writers
seem
mostly
employed
like
children
on
card
pagodas
or
like
the
recumbent
artists
of
the
london
streets
who
produce
on
the
stones
of
the
pavement
gaudy
chalk
drawings
which
the
next
shower
washes
out
but
if
i
would
have
fewer
books
what
business
have
i
to
add
to
the
number
i
may
be
told
who
in
quest
of
quiet
hoots
is
apt
to
make
the
hubbub
he
my
answer
is
that
i
do
not
write
to
expound
my
own
thought
but
to
draw
attention
to
the
thoughts
of
the
men
who
are
best
worth
hearing
it
is
not
given
to
us
small
people
to
think
strongly
and
clearly
like
the
great
people
we
however
gain
in
strength
and
clearness
by
contact
with
them
and
this
contact
i
seek
to
promote
so
long
as
this
book
is
used
it
will
i
hope
be
used
only
as
an
to
the
great
thinkers
whose
names
are
found
in
it
there
is
another
way
in
which
the
book
may
be
of
use
by
considering
the
great
thinkers
in
chronological
order
we
see
that
each
adds
to
the
treasure
which
he
finds
already
accumulated
and
thus
by
degrees
we
are
arriving
in
education
as
in
most
departments
of
human
endeavour
at
a
in
this
science
lies
our
hope
for
the
future
teachers
must
endeavour
to
obtain
more
and
more
knowledge
of
the
laws
to
which
their
art
has
to
conform
itself
it
may
be
of
advantage
to
some
readers
if
i
point
out
briefly
what
seems
to
me
the
course
of
the
main
stream
of
thought
as
it
has
flowed
down
to
us
from
the
renascence
as
i
endeavoured
to
show
at
the
beginning
of
this
book
the
scholars
of
the
renascence
fell
into
a
great
mistake
a
mistake
which
perhaps
could
not
have
been
avoided
at
a
time
when
literature
was
rediscovered
and
the
printing
press
had
just
been
invented
this
mistake
was
the
idolatry
of
books
and
still
worse
of
books
in
latin
and
greek
so
the
schoolmaster
fell
into
a
bad
theory
or
conception
of
his
task
for
he
supposed
that
his
function
was
to
teach
latin
and
greek
and
his
practice
or
way
of
going
to
work
was
not
much
better
for
his
chief
implements
were
grammar
and
the
cane
the
first
who
made
a
great
advance
were
the
jesuits
they
were
indeed
far
too
much
bent
on
being
popular
to
be
they
endeavoured
to
do
well
what
most
schoolmasters
did
badly
they
taught
latin
and
greek
and
they
made
great
use
of
grammar
but
they
gave
up
the
cane
boys
were
to
be
made
happy
were
to
be
reduced
from
hours
a
day
to
hours
and
in
those
hours
learning
was
to
be
made
only
endurable
but
even
but
the
pupils
were
to
find
this
pleasure
not
in
the
exercise
of
their
mental
powers
but
in
other
ways
as
eve
has
said
young
teachers
are
inclined
to
think
mainly
of
stimulating
their
minds
and
so
neglect
the
repetition
needed
for
accuracy
old
teachers
on
the
other
hand
care
so
much
for
accuracy
that
they
require
the
same
thing
over
and
over
till
the
pupils
lose
zest
and
mental
activity
the
jesuits
frankly
adopted
the
maxim
is
the
mother
of
studies
and
worked
over
the
same
ground
again
and
again
the
two
forces
on
which
they
relied
for
making
the
work
pleasant
were
one
personal
influence
of
the
master
will
soon
love
learning
when
they
love
the
teacher
and
one
bad
or
at
least
spur
of
emulation
however
the
attempt
to
lead
not
drive
was
a
great
step
in
the
right
direction
moreover
as
they
did
not
hold
with
the
sturms
and
trotzendorfs
that
the
classics
in
and
for
themselves
were
the
object
of
education
the
jesuits
were
able
to
think
of
other
things
as
well
they
were
very
careful
of
the
health
of
the
body
and
they
also
enlarged
the
task
of
the
schoolmaster
in
another
and
still
more
important
way
to
the
best
of
their
lights
they
attended
to
the
moral
and
religious
training
of
their
pupils
it
is
much
to
the
credit
of
the
fathers
that
though
plautus
and
terence
were
considered
very
valuable
for
giving
a
knowledge
of
colloquial
latin
and
were
studied
and
learnt
by
heart
in
the
protestant
schools
the
jesuits
rejected
them
on
account
of
their
impurity
the
jesuits
wished
the
whole
boy
not
his
memory
only
to
be
affected
by
the
master
so
the
master
was
to
make
a
study
of
each
of
his
pupils
and
to
go
on
with
the
same
pupils
through
the
greater
part
of
their
school
course
the
jesuit
system
stands
out
in
the
history
of
education
as
a
remarkable
instance
of
a
school
system
elaborately
thought
out
and
worked
as
a
whole
in
it
the
individual
schoolmaster
withered
but
the
system
grew
and
was
i
may
say
a
mighty
organism
the
single
jesuit
teacher
might
not
be
the
superior
of
the
average
teacher
in
good
protestant
schools
but
by
their
unity
of
action
the
jesuits
triumphed
over
their
rivals
as
easily
as
a
regiment
of
soldiers
scatters
a
mob
the
theory
of
the
human
mind
made
of
it
to
use
bartle
simile
a
kind
of
bladder
fit
only
to
hold
what
was
poured
into
it
this
theory
of
education
was
first
called
in
question
by
that
strange
genius
who
seems
to
have
stood
outside
all
the
traditions
and
opinions
of
his
age
no
form
of
creed
but
contemplating
i
mean
rabelais
like
most
reformers
rabelais
begins
with
denunciations
of
the
system
established
by
use
and
wont
after
an
account
of
the
and
of
the
day
he
would
be
better
for
a
boy
to
learn
nothing
at
all
than
to
be
taught
books
by
he
then
proposes
a
training
in
which
though
the
boy
is
to
study
books
he
is
not
to
do
this
mainly
but
is
to
be
led
to
look
about
him
and
to
use
both
his
senses
and
his
limbs
for
instance
he
is
to
examine
the
stars
when
he
goes
to
bed
and
then
to
be
called
up
at
four
in
the
morning
to
find
the
change
that
has
taken
place
here
we
see
a
training
of
the
powers
of
observation
these
powers
are
also
to
be
exercised
on
the
trees
and
plants
which
are
met
with
and
on
objects
within
the
house
as
well
as
on
the
food
placed
on
the
table
the
study
of
books
is
to
be
joined
with
this
study
of
things
for
the
old
authors
are
to
be
consulted
for
their
accounts
of
whatever
has
been
met
with
the
study
of
trades
too
and
the
practice
of
some
of
them
such
as
and
carving
in
stone
makes
a
very
interesting
feature
in
this
system
on
the
whole
i
think
we
may
say
that
rabelais
was
the
first
to
advocate
training
as
distinguished
from
teaching
and
he
was
the
father
of
teaching
by
by
the
own
senses
and
the
spring
of
his
own
intelligence
rabelais
would
bestow
much
care
on
the
body
too
not
only
was
the
pupil
to
ride
and
fence
we
find
him
even
shouting
for
the
benefit
of
his
lungs
rabelais
had
now
started
an
entirely
new
theory
of
the
task
and
fifty
years
afterwards
his
thought
was
taken
up
and
put
forward
with
incomparable
vigour
by
the
great
essayist
montaigne
montaigne
starts
with
a
quotation
from
greatest
clerks
are
not
the
wisest
men
and
then
he
makes
one
of
the
most
effective
onslaughts
on
the
theory
that
is
to
be
found
in
all
literature
his
accusation
against
the
schoolmasters
of
his
time
is
twofold
first
he
says
they
aim
only
at
giving
knowledge
whereas
they
should
first
think
of
judgment
and
virtue
secondly
in
their
method
of
teaching
they
do
not
exercise
the
own
minds
the
sum
and
substance
of
the
charge
is
contained
in
these
labour
to
stuff
the
memory
and
in
the
meantime
leave
the
conscience
and
understanding
impoverished
and
his
notion
of
education
embraced
the
whole
man
very
exercises
and
recreations
says
he
wrestling
music
dancing
hunting
riding
fencing
will
prove
to
be
a
good
part
of
our
study
i
would
have
the
outward
fashion
and
mien
and
the
disposition
of
his
limbs
formed
at
the
same
time
with
his
mind
not
a
soul
not
a
body
that
we
are
training
up
but
a
and
we
ought
not
to
divide
before
the
end
of
the
fifteen
hundreds
then
we
see
in
the
best
thought
of
the
time
a
great
improvement
in
the
conception
of
the
task
of
the
schoolmaster
learning
is
not
the
only
thing
to
be
thought
of
moral
and
religious
training
are
recognised
as
of
no
less
importance
and
as
soul
and
body
have
been
created
by
the
hand
of
the
words
are
ignatius
both
must
be
thought
of
in
education
when
we
come
to
instruction
we
find
rabelais
recommending
that
at
least
part
of
it
should
be
and
montaigne
requiring
that
the
instruction
should
involve
an
exercise
of
the
intellectual
powers
of
the
learner
but
the
escape
even
in
thought
from
the
renascence
ideal
was
but
partial
some
of
directions
seem
to
come
from
a
realist
and
montaigne
was
far
from
saying
as
joseph
payne
has
said
act
of
teaching
is
a
mode
of
dealing
with
mind
and
will
be
successful
only
in
proportion
as
this
is
recognised
is
only
another
name
for
mental
but
if
rabelais
and
montaigne
did
not
reach
the
best
thought
of
our
time
they
were
much
in
advance
of
a
great
deal
of
our
the
opening
of
the
sixteen
hundreds
saw
a
great
revolt
from
the
literary
spirit
of
the
renascence
the
exclusive
devotion
to
books
was
followed
by
a
reaction
there
might
after
all
be
something
worth
knowing
that
books
would
not
teach
why
give
so
much
time
to
the
study
of
words
and
so
little
to
the
observation
of
things
says
a
writer
of
the
time
deluged
with
grammar
precepts
infinitely
tedious
perplexed
obscure
and
for
the
most
part
unprofitable
and
that
for
many
why
not
escape
from
this
barren
region
forth
my
son
says
comenius
us
go
into
the
open
air
there
you
shall
view
whatsoever
god
produced
from
the
beginning
and
doth
yet
effect
by
and
milton
thus
expresses
the
conviction
of
his
day
our
understanding
can
not
in
this
body
found
itself
but
on
sensible
things
nor
arrive
so
clearly
to
the
knowledge
of
god
and
things
invisible
as
by
orderly
conning
over
the
visible
and
inferior
creature
the
same
method
is
necessarily
to
be
followed
in
all
discreet
this
great
revolution
which
was
involved
in
the
baconian
philosophy
may
be
described
as
a
turning
from
fancy
to
fact
all
the
creations
of
the
human
mind
seemed
to
have
lost
their
value
the
only
things
that
seemed
worth
studying
were
the
material
universe
and
the
laws
or
sequences
which
were
gradually
ascertained
by
patient
induction
and
experiment
till
the
present
century
this
revolution
did
not
extend
to
our
schools
and
universities
it
is
only
within
the
last
fifty
years
that
natural
science
has
been
studied
even
in
the
university
of
bacon
and
newton
the
public
school
commission
of
found
that
the
curriculum
was
just
as
it
had
been
settled
at
the
renascence
but
if
the
walls
of
these
educational
jerichos
were
still
standing
this
was
not
from
any
remissness
on
the
part
of
children
of
in
shouting
and
blowing
with
the
trumpet
they
raised
the
words
but
things
and
the
cry
has
been
continued
by
a
succession
of
eminent
men
against
the
schools
of
the
and
centuries
and
has
at
length
begun
to
tell
on
the
schools
of
the
perhaps
the
change
demanded
is
best
shown
in
the
words
of
john
dury
about
true
end
of
all
human
learning
is
to
supply
in
ourselves
and
others
the
defects
which
proceed
from
our
ignorance
of
the
nature
and
use
of
the
creatures
and
the
disorderliness
of
our
natural
faculties
in
using
them
and
reflecting
upon
so
the
innovators
required
teachers
to
devote
themselves
to
natural
science
and
to
the
science
of
the
human
mind
the
first
innovators
like
the
people
of
the
fifteen
hundreds
thought
mainly
of
the
acquisition
of
knowledge
only
the
knowledge
was
to
be
not
of
the
classics
but
of
the
material
world
in
this
they
seem
inferior
to
montaigne
who
had
given
the
first
place
to
virtue
and
judgment
but
towards
the
middle
of
the
sixteen
hundreds
a
very
eminent
innovator
took
a
comprehensive
view
of
education
and
reduced
instruction
to
its
proper
place
that
is
he
treated
it
as
a
part
of
education
merely
this
man
comenius
was
at
once
a
philosopher
a
philanthropist
and
a
schoolmaster
and
in
his
writings
we
find
the
first
attempt
at
a
science
of
education
the
outline
of
his
science
is
as
follows
live
a
threefold
vegetative
an
animal
and
an
intellectual
or
spiritual
of
these
the
first
is
perfect
in
the
womb
the
last
in
heaven
he
is
happy
who
comes
with
healthy
body
into
the
world
much
more
he
who
goes
with
healthy
spirit
out
of
it
according
to
the
heavenly
idea
a
man
know
all
things
he
should
be
master
of
things
and
of
himself
he
should
refer
everything
to
god
so
that
within
us
nature
has
implanted
the
seeds
of
learning
of
virtue
and
of
piety
to
bring
these
seeds
to
maturity
is
the
object
of
education
all
men
require
education
and
god
has
made
children
unfit
for
other
employment
that
they
may
have
time
to
here
we
have
quite
a
new
theory
of
the
task
he
is
to
bring
to
maturity
the
seeds
of
learning
virtue
and
piety
which
are
already
sown
by
nature
in
his
pupils
this
is
quite
different
from
the
theory
and
seems
to
anticipate
the
notion
of
froebel
that
the
educator
should
be
called
not
but
but
comenius
evidently
made
too
much
of
knowledge
had
he
lived
two
centuries
later
he
would
have
seen
the
area
of
possible
knowledge
extending
to
infinity
in
all
directions
and
he
would
no
longer
have
made
it
his
ideal
that
should
know
all
the
next
great
thinker
about
mean
to
me
chiefly
important
from
his
having
taken
up
the
principles
of
montaigne
and
treated
the
giving
of
knowledge
as
of
very
small
importance
montaigne
as
we
have
seen
was
the
first
to
bring
out
clearly
that
education
was
much
more
than
instruction
as
the
whole
was
greater
than
its
part
and
that
instruction
was
of
far
less
importance
than
some
other
parts
of
education
and
this
lies
at
the
root
of
theory
also
the
great
function
of
the
educator
according
to
him
is
not
to
but
to
the
pupil
to
virtue
first
industry
next
and
then
knowledge
but
he
thinks
where
the
first
two
have
been
properly
cared
for
knowledge
will
come
of
itself
the
following
are
own
words
great
work
of
a
governor
is
to
fashion
the
carriage
and
to
form
the
mind
to
settle
in
his
pupil
good
habits
and
the
principles
of
virtue
and
wisdom
to
give
him
little
by
little
a
view
of
mankind
and
work
him
into
a
love
and
imitation
of
what
is
excellent
and
praiseworthy
and
in
the
prosecution
of
it
to
give
him
vigour
activity
and
industry
the
studies
which
he
sets
him
upon
are
but
as
it
were
the
exercise
of
his
faculties
and
employment
of
his
time
to
keep
him
from
sauntering
and
idleness
to
teach
him
application
and
accustom
him
to
take
pains
and
to
give
him
some
little
taste
of
what
his
own
industry
must
so
we
see
that
locke
agrees
with
comenius
in
his
enlarged
view
of
the
task
and
that
he
thought
much
less
than
comenius
of
the
importance
of
the
knowledge
to
be
given
we
already
see
a
gradual
escape
from
the
of
the
renascence
locke
instead
of
accepting
the
learned
ideal
declares
that
learning
is
the
last
and
least
thing
to
be
thought
of
he
cares
little
about
the
ordinary
literary
instruction
given
to
children
though
he
thinks
they
must
be
taught
something
and
does
not
know
what
to
put
in
its
place
he
provides
for
the
education
of
those
who
are
to
remain
ignorant
of
greek
but
only
when
they
are
in
this
respect
the
van
is
led
by
comenius
who
thought
of
education
for
boys
and
girls
rich
and
poor
alike
comenius
also
gave
the
first
hint
of
the
true
nature
of
our
bring
to
perfection
the
seeds
implanted
by
nature
he
also
cared
for
the
little
ones
whom
the
schoolmaster
had
despised
locke
does
not
escape
from
a
certain
intellectual
disdain
of
young
masters
as
he
calls
them
but
in
one
respect
he
advanced
as
far
as
the
best
thinkers
among
his
successors
have
advanced
knowledge
he
says
must
come
by
the
action
of
the
own
mind
the
true
teacher
is
within
we
now
come
to
the
least
practical
and
at
the
same
time
the
most
influential
of
all
the
writers
on
mean
rousseau
he
like
rabelais
montaigne
and
locke
was
to
use
matthew
expression
a
of
the
he
attacked
scholastic
use
and
wont
not
in
the
name
of
expedience
but
in
the
name
of
reason
and
such
an
eloquent
so
vehement
so
never
been
made
before
still
there
remained
even
in
theory
and
far
more
in
practice
effects
produced
by
the
false
ideal
of
the
renascence
this
ideal
rousseau
entirely
rejected
he
proposed
making
a
clean
sweep
and
returning
to
what
he
called
the
state
of
nature
rousseau
was
by
no
means
the
first
of
the
reformers
who
advocated
a
return
to
nature
there
has
been
a
constant
conviction
in
minds
from
the
time
of
the
stoics
onwards
that
most
of
the
evils
which
afflict
humanity
have
come
from
our
not
following
the
cry
of
according
to
was
soon
raised
by
educationists
ratke
announced
it
as
one
of
his
principles
comenius
would
base
all
action
on
the
analogy
of
nature
indeed
there
has
hardly
ever
been
a
system
of
education
which
did
not
lay
claim
to
be
the
system
and
by
has
been
always
understood
something
different
from
what
is
usual
what
is
the
notion
that
produces
this
antithesis
when
we
come
to
trace
back
things
to
their
cause
we
are
wont
to
attribute
them
to
god
to
nature
or
to
man
according
to
the
general
belief
god
works
in
and
through
nature
and
therefore
the
tendency
of
things
apart
from
human
agency
must
be
to
good
this
faith
which
underlies
all
our
thoughts
and
modes
of
speech
has
been
beautifully
expressed
by
gracious
spirit
this
earth
presides
and
in
the
heart
of
man
invisibly
it
comes
to
works
of
unreproved
delight
and
tendency
benign
directing
those
who
care
not
know
not
think
not
what
they
v
but
if
the
tendency
of
things
is
to
good
why
should
the
usual
be
in
such
strong
contrast
with
here
again
we
may
turn
to
wordsworth
after
pointing
to
the
harmony
of
the
visible
world
and
declaring
his
faith
that
flower
enjoys
the
air
it
breathes
he
goes
this
belief
from
heaven
be
sent
if
this
be
holy
plan
have
i
not
reason
to
lament
what
man
has
made
of
man
this
passage
might
be
taken
as
the
motto
of
rousseauism
according
to
that
philosophy
man
is
the
great
disturber
and
perverter
of
the
natural
order
other
animals
simply
follow
nature
but
man
has
no
instinct
and
is
thus
left
to
find
his
own
way
what
is
the
consequence
a
very
different
authority
from
rousseau
the
poet
cowper
tells
us
in
language
which
rousseau
might
have
at
every
step
he
treads
man
yet
mistakes
his
way
while
meaner
things
whom
instinct
leads
are
seldom
known
to
man
has
to
investigate
the
sequences
of
nature
and
to
arrange
them
for
himself
in
this
way
he
brings
about
a
great
number
of
foreseen
results
but
in
doing
this
he
also
brings
about
perhaps
even
a
greater
number
of
unforeseen
results
and
alas
it
turns
out
that
many
if
not
most
of
these
unforeseen
results
are
the
reverse
of
beneficial
another
thing
is
observable
other
animals
are
guided
by
instinct
we
for
the
most
part
are
guided
by
tradition
man
it
has
been
said
is
the
only
animal
that
capitalises
his
discoveries
if
we
capitalised
nothing
but
our
discoveries
this
accumulation
would
be
an
immense
advantage
to
us
but
we
capitalise
also
our
conjectures
our
ideals
our
habits
and
unhappily
in
many
cases
our
blunders
so
a
great
deal
of
action
which
is
purely
mischievous
in
its
effects
comes
not
from
our
own
mistakes
but
from
those
of
our
ancestors
the
consequence
is
that
what
with
our
own
mistakes
and
the
mistakes
we
inherit
we
sometimes
go
far
indeed
out
of
the
course
which
has
prescribed
for
us
the
generation
which
found
a
mouthpiece
in
rousseau
had
become
firmly
convinced
not
indeed
of
its
own
stupidity
but
of
the
stupidity
of
all
its
predecessors
and
the
vast
patrimony
bequeathed
to
it
seemed
nothing
but
lumber
or
worse
so
rousseau
found
an
eager
and
enthusiastic
audience
when
he
proposed
a
return
to
nature
in
other
words
to
give
up
all
existing
customs
and
for
the
most
part
to
do
nothing
and
nature
a
his
boy
of
twelve
years
old
was
to
have
been
taught
up
to
that
age
the
great
art
of
education
says
rousseau
is
to
do
everything
by
doing
nothing
the
first
part
of
education
should
be
purely
negative
rousseau
then
was
the
first
who
escaped
completely
from
the
notion
of
the
renascence
that
man
was
mainly
a
and
animal
but
if
he
is
not
this
what
is
he
we
must
ascertain
said
rousseau
not
but
by
observation
we
need
a
new
art
the
art
of
observing
children
now
at
length
there
was
hope
for
the
science
of
education
this
science
must
be
based
on
a
study
of
the
subject
on
whom
we
have
to
act
according
to
locke
there
is
such
variation
not
only
in
the
circumstances
but
also
in
the
personal
peculiarities
of
individuals
that
general
laws
either
do
not
exist
or
can
never
be
ascertained
but
this
variation
is
no
less
observable
in
the
human
body
and
the
art
of
the
physician
has
to
conform
itself
to
a
science
which
is
still
very
far
from
perfect
the
physician
however
does
not
despair
he
carefully
avails
himself
of
such
science
as
we
now
have
and
he
makes
a
study
of
the
human
body
in
order
to
increase
that
science
when
a
few
more
generations
have
passed
away
the
medical
profession
will
very
likely
smile
at
mistakes
made
by
the
old
victorian
doctors
but
meantime
we
profit
by
the
science
of
medicine
in
its
present
state
and
we
find
that
this
science
has
considerably
increased
the
average
duration
of
human
life
we
therefore
require
every
practitioner
to
have
made
a
scientific
study
of
his
calling
and
to
have
had
a
training
in
both
the
theory
and
practice
of
it
the
science
of
education
can
not
be
said
to
have
done
much
for
us
at
present
but
it
will
do
more
in
the
future
and
might
do
more
now
if
no
one
were
allowed
to
teach
before
he
or
she
had
been
trained
in
the
best
theory
and
practice
we
have
since
the
appearance
of
the
emile
the
best
educators
have
studied
the
subject
on
whom
they
had
to
act
and
they
have
been
learning
more
and
more
of
the
laws
or
sequences
which
affect
the
human
mind
and
the
human
body
the
marvellous
strides
of
science
in
every
other
department
encourages
us
to
hope
that
it
will
make
great
advances
in
the
field
of
education
where
it
is
still
so
greatly
needed
perhaps
the
day
may
come
when
a
pestalozzi
may
be
considered
even
by
his
contemporaries
on
an
equality
with
a
napoleon
and
the
human
race
may
be
willing
to
give
to
the
art
of
instruction
the
same
amount
of
time
money
thought
and
energy
which
in
our
day
have
been
devoted
with
such
tremendous
success
to
the
art
of
destruction
it
is
already
dawning
on
the
general
consciousness
that
in
education
as
in
physical
science
conquer
nature
by
obeying
her
and
we
are
learning
more
and
more
how
to
obey
her
great
work
was
first
to
expose
the
absurdities
of
the
and
second
to
set
the
educator
on
studying
the
laws
of
nature
in
the
human
mind
and
body
he
also
drew
attention
to
the
restless
activity
he
would
also
like
locke
before
him
make
the
young
learner
his
own
teacher
there
is
another
way
in
which
the
appearance
of
the
emile
was
as
the
germans
say
from
the
time
of
the
earliest
innovators
we
have
seen
that
not
words
had
been
the
of
a
strong
party
of
reformers
but
had
been
considered
merely
as
a
superior
means
of
instruction
rousseau
first
pointed
out
the
intimate
relation
that
exists
between
children
and
the
material
world
around
them
children
had
till
then
been
thought
of
only
as
immature
and
inferior
men
since
his
day
an
english
poet
has
taught
us
that
in
some
ways
the
man
is
far
inferior
to
the
child
things
which
we
have
seen
we
now
can
see
no
more
and
that
can
bring
back
the
hour
splendour
in
the
grass
of
glory
in
the
rousseau
had
not
gifts
but
he
too
observed
that
childhood
is
the
age
of
strong
impressions
from
without
and
that
its
material
surroundings
affect
it
much
more
acutely
than
they
will
in
after
life
which
of
us
knows
as
much
about
our
own
house
and
furniture
as
our
children
know
still
more
remarkable
is
the
sympathy
children
have
with
animals
if
a
cat
comes
into
a
room
where
there
are
grown
people
and
also
a
child
which
sees
the
cat
first
which
observes
it
most
accurately
now
this
intimate
relation
of
the
child
with
its
surroundings
plays
a
most
important
part
in
its
education
the
educator
may
if
so
minded
ignore
this
altogether
and
stick
to
grammar
dates
and
county
towns
but
if
he
does
so
the
real
education
will
not
be
much
affected
by
him
rousseau
saw
this
clearly
and
wished
to
use
not
for
instruction
but
for
education
their
special
function
was
to
train
the
senses
perhaps
it
is
not
too
much
to
say
of
rousseau
that
he
was
the
first
who
gave
up
thinking
of
the
child
as
a
being
whose
chief
faculty
was
the
faculty
of
remembering
and
thought
of
him
rather
as
a
being
who
feels
and
reflects
acts
and
invents
but
if
the
thought
may
be
traced
back
to
rousseau
it
was
as
left
by
him
quite
crude
or
rather
embryonic
since
his
time
this
conception
of
the
young
has
been
taken
up
and
moulded
into
a
fair
commencement
of
a
science
of
education
this
commencement
is
now
occupying
the
attention
of
thinkers
such
as
herbert
spencer
and
much
may
be
expected
from
it
even
in
the
immediate
future
for
the
science
so
far
as
it
exists
we
are
indebted
mainly
to
the
two
reformers
with
whom
i
will
and
froebel
pestalozzi
like
comenius
more
than
years
before
him
conceived
of
education
for
all
human
being
said
he
a
claim
to
a
judicious
development
of
his
every
child
must
go
to
school
but
the
word
includes
a
great
variety
of
institutions
the
object
these
have
in
view
differs
immensely
with
us
the
main
object
in
some
schools
seems
to
be
to
prepare
boys
to
compete
at
an
early
age
for
entrance
scholarships
awarded
to
the
greatest
proficients
in
latin
and
greek
in
other
schools
the
object
is
to
turn
the
children
out
in
another
sense
that
is
the
school
is
held
to
be
successful
when
the
boys
and
girls
acquire
skill
in
the
arts
of
reading
writing
and
arithmetic
and
can
remember
a
number
of
of
history
of
geography
and
even
of
natural
science
so
the
common
notion
is
that
what
is
wanted
in
the
way
of
education
depends
entirely
on
the
social
position
there
still
linger
among
us
notions
derived
from
the
literary
men
of
the
renascence
we
still
measure
all
children
by
their
literary
and
mnemonic
attainments
we
still
consider
knowledge
of
latin
and
greek
the
highest
kind
of
knowledge
children
are
sent
to
school
that
they
may
not
be
ignorant
pestalozzi
who
had
studied
rousseau
entirely
denied
all
this
he
required
that
the
should
be
turned
and
started
in
a
new
direction
the
main
object
of
the
school
was
not
to
teach
but
to
develop
not
to
but
to
the
study
of
nature
shows
us
that
every
animal
comes
into
the
world
with
certain
faculties
or
capabilities
there
are
a
set
of
circumstances
which
will
develop
these
capabilities
and
make
the
most
of
them
there
are
other
circumstances
which
would
impede
this
development
decrease
it
or
even
prevent
it
altogether
all
other
animals
have
this
development
secured
for
them
by
their
ordinary
environment
but
man
with
far
higher
capacities
and
with
immeasurably
greater
faculties
both
for
good
and
evil
is
left
far
more
to
his
own
resources
than
the
other
animals
placed
in
an
almost
endless
variety
of
circumstances
we
have
to
ascertain
how
the
development
of
our
offspring
may
best
be
brought
about
we
have
to
consider
what
are
the
inborn
faculties
of
our
children
and
also
what
aids
and
what
hinders
their
development
when
we
have
arrived
at
this
knowledge
we
must
educate
them
by
placing
them
in
the
best
circumstances
in
our
power
and
then
superintending
judiciously
and
lovingly
the
development
of
their
faculties
and
of
their
higher
nature
there
is
said
pestalozzi
only
one
way
in
which
faculty
can
be
developed
and
that
is
by
exercise
so
his
system
sought
to
encourage
the
activities
of
children
and
in
this
respect
he
was
surpassed
as
we
shall
see
by
froebel
knowledge
as
it
has
been
knowledge
commonly
acquired
for
examinations
our
in
despised
by
pestalozzi
as
it
had
been
by
locke
and
rousseau
before
him
in
its
place
he
would
put
knowledge
acquired
by
by
the
spring
of
the
own
intelligence
the
conception
of
every
child
as
an
organism
and
of
education
as
the
process
by
which
the
development
of
that
organism
is
promoted
is
found
first
in
pestalozzi
but
it
was
more
consistently
thought
out
by
froebel
there
is
said
froebel
a
divine
idea
for
every
human
being
for
we
are
all
offspring
the
object
of
the
education
of
a
human
being
is
to
further
the
development
of
his
divine
idea
this
development
is
attainable
only
through
action
for
the
development
of
every
organism
depends
on
its
then
activity
a
will
is
the
main
thing
to
be
cared
for
in
education
the
educator
has
to
direct
the
activity
in
such
a
way
that
it
may
satisfy
their
instincts
especially
the
formative
and
creative
instincts
the
child
from
his
earliest
years
is
to
be
treated
as
a
and
even
a
now
at
last
we
have
arrived
at
the
complete
antithesis
between
the
old
education
and
the
new
the
old
education
had
one
object
and
that
was
learning
man
was
a
being
who
learnt
and
remembered
education
was
a
process
by
which
he
at
first
the
languages
and
literatures
of
rome
and
greece
only
but
as
time
went
on
the
curriculum
was
greatly
extended
the
new
education
treats
the
human
being
not
so
much
a
learner
as
a
doer
and
creator
the
educator
no
longer
fixes
his
eyes
on
the
knowledge
but
on
the
being
to
be
educated
the
success
of
the
education
is
not
determined
by
what
the
educated
but
by
what
they
and
what
they
they
are
well
educated
when
they
love
what
is
good
and
have
had
all
their
faculties
of
mind
and
body
properly
developed
to
do
it
the
new
education
then
is
following
and
must
be
based
on
the
study
of
human
nature
when
we
have
ascertained
what
are
the
faculties
to
be
developed
we
must
consider
further
how
to
foster
the
that
will
develop
them
we
have
travelled
far
from
johnson
who
asserted
that
education
was
as
well
known
as
it
ever
could
be
some
of
us
are
more
inclined
to
assert
that
in
his
day
education
was
not
invented
on
the
other
hand
there
are
those
who
belittle
the
new
education
and
endeavour
to
show
that
in
it
there
is
nothing
new
at
all
as
it
seems
to
me
a
revolution
of
the
most
salutary
kind
was
made
by
the
thinkers
who
proposed
basing
education
on
a
study
of
the
subject
to
be
educated
and
more
than
this
making
the
process
a
process
with
the
object
of
drawing
out
this
change
of
object
must
in
the
end
be
fruitful
in
changes
of
every
kind
but
as
yet
we
are
only
groping
our
way
and
if
i
may
give
a
caution
which
in
this
country
at
least
is
quite
superfluous
we
should
be
cautious
and
till
we
see
our
way
clearly
we
should
try
no
great
experiment
that
would
destroy
our
connexion
with
the
past
most
of
our
predecessors
thought
only
of
knowledge
by
a
reaction
some
of
our
new
educationists
seem
to
despise
knowledge
but
knowledge
is
necessary
and
without
some
knowledge
development
would
be
impossible
we
probably
can
not
do
too
much
to
assist
development
and
encourage
but
there
is
perhaps
some
danger
of
our
losing
sight
of
truths
which
schoolroom
experience
would
bring
home
to
us
even
the
clearest
get
hazy
again
and
totally
unfit
for
use
unless
they
are
permanently
fixed
in
the
mind
by
repetition
which
to
be
effective
must
to
some
extent
take
the
form
of
the
practical
man
even
the
crammer
has
here
mastered
a
truth
of
the
teaching
art
which
the
educationist
is
prone
to
overlook
and
there
are
no
doubt
other
things
which
the
practical
man
can
teach
but
the
great
thinkers
would
raise
us
to
a
higher
from
which
we
may
see
much
that
will
make
the
right
road
clearer
to
us
and
lead
us
to
press
forward
in
it
with
good
heart
and
hope

to
me
to
have
been
very
successful
in
bringing
out
the
most
important

of
his

his

shows

we

it
seems
to
me
a
good

which
we
do
not
want

opens

no

in

sturm
knew
what
he
was
about
as
well
as
most
men
of
his
time
yet
few
will
be
disposed
to
accept
his
theory
of
education
even
for
the
sixteenth
century
as
the
best
wherein
then
lay
the
mistake
sturm
asserted
that
the
proper
end
of
school
education
is
eloquence
or
in
modern
phrase
a
masterly
command
of
language
and
that
the
knowledge
of
things
mainly
belongs
to
a
later
stage
sturm
assumed
that
latin
is
the
language
in
which
eloquence
is
to
be
this
is

him

he

over
of

will
take
delight
in
finding
within
them
a
treasure
which
at
a
time
of
life
otherwise
unfruitful
they
have
been
preparing
almost
without
knowing
it
how
often
we
see
and
hear
eminent
men
far
advanced
in
life
when
in
learned
and
noble
company
take
a
special
delight
in
quoting
what
they
stored
up
as
boys
the
master
he
says
must
point
out
to
his
pupils
the
advantages
we
derive
from
memory
that
we
only
know
and
possess
that
which
we
retain
that
this
can
not
be
taken
from
us
but
is
with
us
always
and
is
always
ready
for
use
a
living
library
which
may
be
studied
even
in
the
dark
boys
should
therefore
be
encouraged
to
run
over
in
their
minds
or
to
say
aloud
what
they
have
learnt
as
often
as
opportunity
offers
as
when
they
are
walking
or
are
by
themselves

this
is
interesting
and
well
put
but
we
see
one
or
two
points
in
which
we
have
now
made
an
advance
learning
by
heart
will
give
none
of
the
advantages
mentioned
unless
the
boys
understand
the
pieces
and
delight
in
them
learning
by
heart
strengthens
no
doubt
a
faculty
but
nothing
large
enough
to
be
called
and
the
renascence
must
indeed
have
blinded
the
eyes
of
the
man
to
whom
childhood
and
youth
seemed

parum

marvellous
instances
of

in
that
most
interesting
book
francis
in
boston
little
edition
i
have
referred
to
francis
parkman
who
has
chronicled
the
marvellous
and
heroism
of
the
jesuit
missionaries
in
canada
such
a
witness
may
be
trusted
when
he
says
jesuit
was
as
often
a
fanatic
for
his
order
as
for
his
faith
and
oftener
yet
the
two
fanaticisms
mingled
in
him
inextricably
ardently
as
he
burned
for
the
saving
of
souls
he
would
have
none
saved
on
the
upper
lakes
except
by
his
brethren
and
himself
he
claimed
a
monopoly
of
conversion
with
its
attendant
monopoly
of
toil
hardships
and
martyrdom
often
disinterested
for
himself
he
was
inordinately
ambitious
for
the
great
corporate
power
in
which
he
had
merged
his
own
personality
and
here
lies
one
of
the
causes
among
many
of
the
seeming
contradictions
which
abound
in
the
annals
of
the
discovery
of
the
great
by
parkman
london
in
a
letter
dated
from
stonyhurst
april
the
best
account
i
have
seen
of
life
in
a
jesuit
school
is
in
eines
chemaligen
leipzig
brockhaus
the
writer
köhler
says
that
he
has
become
an
evangelical
clergyman
but
there
is
no
hostile
feeling
shown
to
his
old
instructors
and
the
narrative
bears
the
strongest
internal
evidence
of
accuracy
some
of
the
jesuit
devices
mentioned
are
very
ingenious
all
house
masters
who
have
adopted
the
cubicle
arrangement
of
dormitories
know
how
difficult
it
is
to
keep
the
boys
in
their
own
cubicles
the
jesuits
have
the
cubicles
barred
across
at
the
top
and
the
locks
on
the
doors
are
so
constructed
that
though
they
can
be
opened
from
the
inside
can
not
be
shut
the
fathers
at
freiburg
in
breisgau
opened
a
for
the
boys
and
gave
in
counters
which
passed
at
their
own
shop
and
nowhere
else
the
author
speaks
warmly
of
the
kindness
of
the
fathers
and
of
their
care
for
health
and
recreation
but
their
ways
were
inscrutable
and
every
boy
felt
himself
in
the
hands
of
a
providence
as
the
boys
go
out
for
a
walk
one
of
them
is
detained
by
the
porter
who
says
rector
wants
to
speak
to
on
their
way
back
the
boys
meet
a
diligence
in
which
sits
their
late
comrade
waving
adieus
has
been
another
book
which
throws
much
light
on
jesuit
pedagogy
is
by
a
par
le
emmanuel
barbier
paris
palmé
edition
i
will
give
a
specimen
in
a
loose
translation
as
it
may
interest
the
reader
to
see
how
carefully
the
jesuits
have
studied
the
difficulties
master
in
charge
of
the
boys
especially
in
in
his
first
intercourse
with
them
has
no
greater
snare
in
his
way
than
taking
his
power
for
granted
and
trusting
to
the
strength
of
his
will
and
his
knowledge
of
the
world
especially
as
he
is
at
first
lulled
into
security
by
the
deferential
manner
of
his
pupils
master
who
goes
off
with
such
ease
from
the
very
first
to
whom
the
carrying
out
of
all
the
rules
seems
the
simplest
thing
in
the
world
who
in
the
very
first
hour
he
is
with
them
has
already
made
himself
liked
almost
popular
with
his
pupils
who
shows
no
more
anxiety
about
his
work
than
he
must
show
to
keep
his
character
for
good
sense
that
master
is
indeed
to
be
pitied
he
is
most
likely
a
lost
man
he
will
soon
have
to
choose
one
of
two
things
either
to
shut
his
eyes
and
put
up
with
all
the
irregularities
he
thought
he
had
done
away
with
or
to
break
with
a
past
that
he
would
wish
forgotten
and
engage
in
open
conflict
with
the
boys
who
are
inclined
to
set
him
at
defiance
these
cases
are
we
trust
rare
but
many
believe
with
a
kind
of
rash
ignorance
and
in
spite
of
the
warnings
of
experience
that
the
good
feelings
of
their
pupils
will
work
together
to
maintain
their
authority
they
have
been
told
that
this
authority
should
be
mild
and
endeared
by
acts
of
kindness
so
they
set
about
crowning
the
edifice
without
making
sure
of
the
foundations
and
taking
the
title
of
authority
for
its
possession
they
spend
all
their
efforts
in
lightening
a
yoke
of
which
no
one
really
bears
the
weight
point
of
fact
the
first
steps
often
determine
the
whole
course
for
this
reason
you
will
attach
extreme
importance
to
what
i
am
now
going
to
advise
chief
characteristic
in
your
conduct
towards
the
boys
during
the
first
few
weeks
should
be
extreme
however
far
you
go
in
this
you
can
hardly
overdo
it
so
your
first
attitude
is
clearly
defined
have
everything
to
observe
the
individual
character
of
each
boy
and
the
general
tendencies
and
feelings
of
the
whole
body
but
be
sure
of
one
thing
that
are
observed
also
and
a
careful
study
is
made
both
of
your
strong
points
and
of
your
weak
your
way
of
speaking
and
of
giving
orders
the
tone
of
your
voice
your
gestures
disclose
your
character
your
tastes
your
failings
to
a
hundred
boys
on
the
alert
to
pounce
upon
them
one
is
summed
up
long
before
one
has
the
least
notion
of
it
try
then
to
remain
impenetrable
you
should
never
give
up
your
reserve
till
you
are
master
of
the
situation
the
rest
let
there
be
no
affectation
about
you
attempt
to
put
on
a
severe
manner
answer
politely
and
simply
your
questions
but
let
it
be
in
few
words
and
all
depends
on
that
let
there
be
no
chatting
with
them
in
these
early
days
you
can
not
be
too
cautious
in
this
respect
boys
have
such
a
polite
such
a
taking
way
with
them
in
drawing
out
information
about
your
impressions
your
tastes
your
antecedents
attempt
the
diplomate
match
your
skill
against
theirs
you
can
not
chat
without
coming
out
of
your
shell
so
to
speak
instead
of
this
you
must
puzzle
them
by
your
reserve
and
drive
them
to
this
admission
know
what
to
make
of
our
new
i
advise
you
then
to
be
on
the
defensive
throughout
the
whole
year
and
like
a
stranger
among
your
pupils
no
a
thousand
times
no
it
is
just
to
make
their
relations
with
you
simple
confiding
i
might
say
cordial
without
the
least
danger
to
your
authority
that
i
endeavour
to
raise
this
authority
at
first
beyond
the
reach
of
chap
v
pp
ff
in
this
book
we
see
the
best
side
of
the
jesuits
they
believe
in
their
and
this
belief
throws
light
on
many
things
those
who
hate
the
jesuits
have
often
extolled
the
wisdom
of
montaigne
when
he
says
have
not
to
train
up
a
soul
nor
yet
a
body
but
a
man
and
we
can
not
divide
can
they
see
no
wisdom
in
your
mind
be
filled
with
the
thought
that
both
soul
and
body
have
been
created
by
the
hand
of
god
we
must
account
to
him
for
these
two
parts
of
our
being
and
we
are
not
required
to
weaken
one
of
them
out
of
love
for
the
creator
we
should
love
the
body
in
the
same
degree
that
he
could
love
this
is
what
loyola
wrote
in
to
francis
borgia
compayré
vol
j
but
if
we
wish
to
see
the
other
side
of
the
jesuit
character
we
have
only
to
look
at
the
jesuit
as
a
controversialist
we
sometimes
see
children
hiding
things
and
then
having
a
pretence
hunt
for
them
the
jesuits
are
no
children
but
in
arguing
they
pretend
to
be
searching
for
conclusions
which
are
settled
before
arguments
are
thought
of
see
the
attack
on
the
port
royalists
in
jésuites
par
le
ch
daniel
in
which
the
jesuit
sets
himself
to
maintain
this
thesis
source
aussi
profondément
infectée
du
poison
de
il
ne
pouvait
sortir
rien
one
good
point
he
certainly
makes
and
in
my
judgment
one
only
in
comparing
the
port
royalist
schools
with
the
schools
of
jesuits
methods
which
answer
with
very
small
numbers
may
not
do
with
large
numbers
might
as
well
try
to
extend
your
gardening
operations
to
i
am
sorry
to
use
a
german
word
but
educational
matters
have
been
so
little
considered
among
us
that
we
have
no
english
vocabulary
for
them
the
want
of
a
word
for
was
felt
over
years
ago
for
shall
be
prepared
by
which
from
beholding
the
things
gentlewomen
may
learn
the
names
natures
values
and
use
of
herbs
shrubs
trees
metals
and
to
revive
the
antient
education
of
london
see
the
very
interesting
on
by
dean
church
perhaps
the
saying
of
which
is
most
frequently
quoted
is
the
paradox
par
cœur
pas
know
by
heart
is
not
to
but
these
words
are
often
misunderstood
the
meaning
as
i
take
it
is
this
when
a
thought
has
entered
into
the
mind
it
shakes
off
the
words
by
which
it
was
conveyed
thither
therefore
so
long
as
the
words
are
indispensable
the
thought
is
not
known
knowing
and
knowing
by
heart
are
not
necessarily
opposed
but
they
are
different
things
and
as
the
mind
most
easily
runs
along
sequences
of
words
a
knowledge
of
the
words
often
conceals
ignorance
or
neglect
of
the
thought
i
once
asked
a
boy
if
he
thought
of
the
meaning
when
he
repeated
latin
poetry
and
i
got
the
instructive
answer
i
am
not
sure
of
the
but
there
are
cases
in
which
we
naturally
connect
a
particular
form
of
words
with
thoughts
that
have
become
part
of
our
minds
we
then
know
and
know
by
heart
also
lord
armstrong
has
perhaps
never
read
on
certainly
he
has
not
borrowed
from
it
and
yet
much
that
he
says
in
discussing
cry
for
useless
century
november
is
just
what
montaigne
said
more
than
three
centuries
ago
aphorism
that
knowledge
is
power
is
so
constantly
used
by
educational
enthusiasts
that
it
may
almost
be
regarded
as
the
motto
of
the
party
but
the
first
essential
of
a
motto
is
that
it
be
true
and
it
is
certainly
not
true
that
knowledge
is
the
same
as
power
seeing
that
it
is
only
an
aid
to
power
the
power
of
a
surgeon
to
amputate
a
limb
no
more
lies
in
his
knowledge
than
in
his
knife
in
fact
the
knife
has
the
better
claim
to
potency
of
the
two
for
a
man
may
hack
off
a
limb
with
his
knife
alone
but
not
with
his
knowledge
alone
knowledge
is
not
even
an
aid
to
power
in
all
cases
seeing
that
useless
knowledge
which
is
no
uncommon
article
in
our
popular
schools
has
no
relation
to
power
the
true
source
of
power
is
the
originative
action
of
the
mind
which
we
see
exhibited
in
the
daily
incidents
of
life
as
well
as
in
matters
of
great
importance
a
success
in
life
depends
incomparably
more
upon
his
capacities
for
useful
action
than
upon
his
acquirements
in
knowledge
and
the
education
of
the
young
should
therefore
be
directed
to
the
development
of
faculties
and
valuable
qualities
rather
than
to
the
acquisition
of
knowledge
men
of
capacity
and
possessing
qualities
for
useful
action
are
at
a
premium
all
over
the
world
while
men
of
mere
education
are
at
a
deplorable
is
a
great
tendency
in
the
scholastic
world
to
underrate
the
value
and
potency
of
which
commences
on
leaving
school
and
endures
all
through
deprecate
plunging
into
doubtful
and
costly
schemes
of
instruction
led
on
by
the
that
is
a
for
where
natural
capacity
is
wasted
in
attaining
knowledge
it
would
be
truer
to
say
that
knowledge
is
in
another
matter
also
we
find
that
the
masters
of
these
schools
subsequently
departed
widely
from

the

that

it
differs
slightly
from

of

mulcaster
goes
on
to
talk
about
the
brain
of
course
he
does
not
anticipate
the
discoveries
of
science
but
his
language
is
very
different
from
what
we
should
expect
from
a
writer
in
the
age
serve
the
turn
of
these
two
both
and
nature
hath
planted
in
our
body
a
the
prince
of
all
our
parts
which
by
spreading
sinews
of
all
sorts
throughout
all
our
parts
doth
work
all
those
effects
which
either
is
seen
in
or
perceived
p
but
much
as
he
thinks
of
the
body
mulcaster
is
no
materialist
of
all
our
soul
hath
in
it
an
imperial
prerogative
of
understanding
beyond
sense
of
judging
by
reason
of
directing
by
both
for
duty
towards
god
for
society
towards
men
for
conquest
in
affections
for
purchase
in
knowledge
and
such
other
things
whereby
it
furnisheth
out
all
manner
of
uses
in
this
our
mortal
life
and
bewrayeth
in
itself
a
more
excellent
being
than
to
continue
still
in
this
roaming
p
the
grand
thing
he
says
is
to
bring
all
these
abilities
to
perfection
so
heavenly
a
benefit
is
begun
by
education
confirmed
by
use
perfected
with
continuance
which
crowneth
the
whole
p
makes
the
boy
toward
nurture
sees
him
p
the
neglect
of
the
material
world
which
has
been
for
ages
the
source
of
mischief
of
all
kinds
in
the
schoolroom
and
which
has
not
yet
entirely
passed
away
would
have
been
impossible
if
elementary
course
had
been
adopted
the

by
nature
nimble
to

to

to

anything
else
which
beareth
praise
in
that
kind

not

the
greatest
instruments
whereby
the
receiving
and
delivery
of
our

is

executed
and
doth
not
this
elementary
instruct
the
hand
to
write
to
draw
to

the
eye
to
read
by
letters
to
discern
by

said
the
elizabethan
schoolmaster
so
says
the
victorian
reformer
i
wish
some
good
author
would
write
a
book
on
and
show
how
on
some
subjects
wise
men
go
on
saying
the
same
thing
in
all
ages
and
nobody
listens
to
them
plato
said
every
work
the
beginning
is
the
most
important
part
especially
in
dealing
with
anything
young
and
bk
ii
davies
and
vaughan
p
and
the
complaints
about
prove
our
common
neglect
of
what
mulcaster
urged
three
centuries
ago
the
because
good
scholars
will
not
abase
themselves
to
it
it
is
left
to
the
meanest
and
therefore
to
the
worst
for
that
the
first
grounding
would
be
handled
by
the
best
and
his
reward
would
be
greatest
because
both
his
pains
and
his
judgment
should
be
with
the
greatest
and
it
would
easily
allure
sufficient
men
to
come
down
so
low
if
they
might
perceive
that
reward
would
rise
up
no
man
of
judgment
will
contrary
this
point
neither
can
any
ignorant
be
blamed
for
the
contrary
the
one
seeth
the
thing
to
be
but
low
in
order
the
other
knoweth
the
ground
to
be
great
in
laying
not
only
for
the
matter
which
the
child
doth
learn
which
is
very
small
in
show
though
great
for
process
but
also
for
the
manner
of
handling
his
wit
to
hearten
him
for
afterward
which
is
of
great
moment
the
first
master
can
deal
but
with
a
few
the
next
with
more
and
so
still
upward
as
reason
groweth
on
and
receives
without
forcing
it
is
the
foundation
well
and
soundly
laid
which
makes
all
the
upper
building
muster
with
countenance
and
continuance
if
i
were
to
strike
the
stroke
as
i
am
but
to
give
counsel
the
first
pains
truly
taken
should
in
good
truth
be
most
liberally
recompensed
and
less
allowed
still
upward
as
the
pains
diminish
and
the
ease
increaseth
whereat
no
master
hath
cause
to
repine
so
he
may
have
his
children
well
grounded
in
the
whose
imperfection
at
this
day
doth
marvellously
trouble
both
masters
and
scholars
so
that
we
can
hardly
do
any
good
nay
scantly
tell
how
to
place
the
too
too
raw
boys
in
any
certain
form
with
hope
to
go
forward
orderly
the
of
their
entry
being
so
rotten
pp
quaint
as
we
find
mulcaster
in
his
mode
of
expression
the
thing
expressed
is
sometimes
rather
what
we
should
expect
from
herbert
spencer
than
from
a
schoolmaster
of
the
renascence
i
have
met
with
nothing
more
modern
in
thought
than
the
following
time
all
learning
may
be
brought
into
one
tongue
and
that
natural
to
the
inhabitant
so
that
schooling
for
tongues
may
prove
needless
as
once
they
were
not
needed
but
it
can
never
fall
out
that
arts
and
sciences
in
their
right
nature
shall
be
but
most
necessary
for
any
commonwealth
that
is
not
given
over
unto
too
too
much
to
a
regulation
like
that
of
the
ancient
spartans
the
theft
of
knowledge
in
our
sex
is
only
connived
at
while
carefully
concealed
and
if
displayed
is
punished
with
so
says
barbauld
and
i
have
met
with
similar
passages
in
other
female
writers
john
brinsley
the
elder
who
married
a
sister
of
bishop
and
kept
school
at
was
it
the
was
one
of
the
best
english
writers
on
education
in
his
for
our
grammar
published
early
in
the
sixteen
hundreds
he
says
others
myself
having
first
had
long
experience
of
the
manifold
evils
which
grow
from
the
ignorance
of
a
right
order
of
teaching
and
afterwards
some
gracious
taste
of
the
sweetness
that
is
to
be
found
in
the
better
courses
truly
known
and
practised
i
have
betaken
me
almost
wholly
for
many
years
unto
this
weighty
work
and
that
not
without
much
comfort
through
the
goodness
of
our
blessed
p
for
the
most
part
wherein
any
good
is
done
it
is
ordinarily
effected
by
the
endless
vexation
of
the
painful
master
the
extreme
labour
and
terror
of
the
poor
children
with
enduring
far
overmuch
and
long
severity
now
whence
proceedeth
all
this
but
because
so
few
of
those
who
undertake
this
function
are
acquainted
with
any
good
method
or
right
order
of
instruction
fit
for
a
grammar
school
p
it
is
sad
to
think
how
many
generations
have
since
suffered
from
teachers
with
any
good
method
or
right
order
of
and
it
seems
to
justify
dictum
engländer
ist
eigentlich
ohne
that
for
several
generations
to
come
this
evil
will
be
but
partially
abated
at
cambridge
as
also
in
london
and
edinburgh
there
is
already
a
training
college
for
women
teachers
in
secondary
schools
all
we
know
of
his
life
may
soon
be
told
richard
mulcaster
was
a
cumberland
man
of
good
family
an
borne
as
he
calls
himself
who
was
at
eton
then
college
cambridge
then
at
christ
church
oxford
his
birth
year
was
probably
or
and
he
became
a
student
of
christ
church
in
in
he
settled
as
a
schoolmaster
in
london
and
was
elected
first
headmaster
of
merchant
school
which
dates
from
here
he
remained
years
till
whether
he
then
became
as
wilson
says
surmaster
of
i
can
not
determine
but
came
highmaster
in
and
held
that
office
for
twelve
years
though
in
elizabeth
made
him
rector
of
stanford
rivers
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
he
did
not
give
up
the
highmastership
till
when
he
must
have
been
about
years
old
he
died
at
stanford
rivers
three
years
later
while
at
merchant
in
and
he
published
the
two
books
which
have
secured
for
him
a
permanent
place
in
the
history
of
education
in
england
the
first
was
his
the
second
first
and
as
it
proved
the
only
part
of
his
of
his
other
writings
his
seems
to
have
been
the
most
important
and
a
very
interesting
quotation
from
it
has
been
preserved
in
preface
to
the
of
comenius
but
the
book
itself
is
lost
at
least
i
never
heard
of
a
copy
and
i
have
sought
in
vain
in
the
british
museum
and
at
the
university
libraries
of
oxford
and
cambridge
his
is
a
rare
book
but
rev
lupton
has
found
and
described
a
copy
in
the
bodleian
and
in
by
seeley
elsewhere
in
the
same
lecture
professor
seeley
says
schoolmaster
might
set
this
right
every
boy
that
enters
the
school
is
a
creature
he
is
a
performer
in
his
small
degree
upon
the
same
instrument
as
milton
and
shakespeare
only
do
not
sacrifice
this
advantage
do
not
try
by
artificial
and
laborious
processes
to
give
him
a
new
knowledge
before
you
have
developed
that
which
he
has
already
train
and
perfect
the
gift
of
speech
unfold
all
that
is
in
it
and
you
train
at
the
same
time
the
power
of
thought
and
the
power
of
intellectual
sympathy
you
enable
your
pupil
to
think
the
thoughts
and
to
delight
in
the
words
of
great
philosophers

this
lecture

children
are

to

first
they
have
to
say
the
very
easy
task
as
it
seems
to
us
but
if
we
met
with
a
strange
word
of
and
that
not
a
compound
word
but
one
of
which
every
syllable
was
new
to
us
we
might
have
some
difficulty
in
remembering
it
and
yet
such
a
word
would
be
to
us
what
the
alphabet
is
to
a
child
when
he
can
perform
this
feat
he
is
next
required
to
learn
the
visual
symbols
of
the
sounds

to
connect
these
with

vocal
symbols
some
of
the
vocal
symbols
bring
the
child
in
contact
with
the
sound
itself
but
most
are
simply
conventional
what
notion
does
the

get
of
the
aspirate
from
the
name

having
learnt
visual

symbols

with
john

for
their

hartlib
came
to
england
not
later
than
and
devoted
himself
to
the
furtherance
of
a
variety
of
schemes
for
the
public
good
he
was
one
of
those
rare
beings
who
labour
to
promote
the

of

if
they

carried
forth
to
watch
for
the
opportunities
of
provoking
others
who
can
do
more
to
improve
their
talents
i
have
found
experimentally
that
my
endeavours
have
not
been
without
quoted
by
dircks
p
the
philosophy
of
bacon
seemed
to
have
introduced
an
age
of
boundless
improvement
and
men
like
comenius
hartlib
petty
and
dury
caught
the
first
unchecked
enthusiasm
is
scarce
one
day
so
hartlib
wrote
to
robert
boyle
one
hour
of
the
day
or
night
being
brim
full
with
all
manner
of
objects
of

public

universal
nature
but
my
soul
is
crying
out
redde

quid

but
in
this
world
hartlib
looked
in
vain
for
the
day
the
income
of
a
year
allowed
him
by
parliament
was
in
arrears
at
the
restoration
and
he
had
then
nothing
to
hope
his
last
years
were
attended
by
much
physical
suffering
and
by
extreme
poverty
he
died
as
evelyn
thought
at
oxford
in

this
is
uncertain

gives
us
the
following
from
chap
ix
cols
of
the
to
say
something
particularly
on
this
subject
can
any
sufficient
reason
be
given
why
the
weaker
sex
literally
the
or
sex
is
his
phrase
borrowed
from
apuleius
and
though
the
phrase
is
usually
translated
the
inferior
sex
it
seems
to
have
been
chosen
by
comenius
to
avoid
that
implication
should
be
wholly
shut
out
from
liberal
studies
whether
in
the
native
tongue
or
in
latin
for
equally
are
they
image
equally
are
they
partakers
of
grace
and
of
the
kingdom
to
come
equally
are
they
furnished
with
minds
agile
and
capable
of
wisdom
yea
often
beyond
our
sex
equally
to
them
is
there
a
possibility
of
attaining
high
distinction
inasmuch
as
they
have
often
been
employed
by
god
himself
for
the
government
of
peoples
the
bestowing
of
wholesome
counsels
on
kings
and
princes
the
science
of
medicine
and
other
things
useful
to
the
human
race
nay
even
the
prophetical
office
and
the
rattling
reprimand
of
priests
and
bishops
etiam

munus
et
increpandos
sacerdotes
episcoposque
are
the
words
and
as
the

was
prepared
for

press
in
one
detects
a
reference

quote
this
latin
from
the
excellent
article
by
several
writers
in
it
is
a
great
thing
to
get
an
exact
words
unfortunately
the
writer
in
the
follows
custom
and
does
not
give
the
means
of
verifying
the
quotation
comenius
in
latin
i
have
never
seen
except
in
the
british
museum
in
sermon
on
charity
schools
the
bishop
points
out
that
up
children
is
a
very
different
thing
from
merely
teaching
them
some
truths
necessary
to
be
known
or
he
goes
into
the
historical
aspect
of
the
subject
as
since
the
days
of
elizabeth
there
has
been
legal
provision
for
the
maintenance
of
the
poor
there
has
been
also
of
some
particular
legal
provision
in
behalf
of
poor
children
for
their
this
not
being
included
in
what
we
call
says
the
bishop
might
be
necessary
that
a
burden
so
entirely
new
as
that
of
a
was
at
the
time
i
am
speaking
of
should
be
as
light
as
possible
thus
the
legal
provision
for
the
poor
was
first
settled
without
any
particular
consideration
of
that
additional
want
in
the
case
of
children
as
it
still
remains
with
scarce
any
alteration
in
this
and
for
nearly
a
century
longer
great
changes
naturally
followed
and
will
follow
from
the
extension
of
the
franchise
and
another
century
will
probably
see
us
with
a
folkschool
worthy
of
its
importance
by
that
time
we
shall
no
longer
be
open
to
the
sarcasm
of

highly
instructive
to
visit
english

for
there
you
find
everything
that

be

calkins

do
you
learn

a
cookery
book
something
new
something
that
you
did
not
know
before
in

paragraph
but
would
you
therefore
put
the
wretched
cookery
book
on
a
higher
level
of
estimation
than
the

poem
what
you
owe

not
any
of
which
a
million
separate
items

a
million
of

what

that

exercise

your

latent
capacity

ascending

altitudes

all
the
steps
of

carry
you
further
on

you
one
foot

an
ascending
into

i
have
met
with
this
as
a
quotation
from
de
quincey
when
i
visited
some
years
ago
the
at
brussels
i
was
told
that
books
were
used
for
except
for
learning
to
read
comenius
was
saved
from
this
consequence
of
his
realism
by
his
fervent
christianity
he
valued
the
study
of
the
bible
as
highly
as
the
renascence
scholars
valued
the
study
of
the
classics
though
for
a
very
different
reason
he
cared
for
the
bible
not
as
literature
but
as
the
highest
authority
on
the
problems
of
existence
those
who
like
matthew
arnold
may
attribute
to
it
far
less
authority
may
still
treasure
it
as
literature
while
those
who
despise
literature
and
recognise
no
authority
above
things
would
limit
us
to
the
curriculum
of
the
and
care
for
natural
science
only
in
this
country
we
are
fortunately
able
to
advocate
some
reforms
which
were
suggested
by
the
realism
of
comenius
without
incurring
any
suspicion
of
rejecting
his
christianity
it
is
singular
to
see
how
the
highest
authorities
of
conversant
with
the
subject
on
the
side
of
practice
as
well
as
precisely
the
language
which
practical
men
have
been
wont
to
laugh
at
as
ever
since
the
days
of
comenius
a
striking
instance
will
be
found
in
a
lecture
by
the
principal
of
the
battersea
training
college
rev
canon
daniel
as
reported
in
july
compare
what
comenius
said
with
the
following
are
not
sufficiently
required
to
use
their
senses
they
are
allowed
to
observe
by
deputy
they
look
at
nature
through
the
spectacles
of
books
and
through
the
eyes
of
the
teacher
but
do
not
observe
for
themselves
it
might
be
expected
that
in
object
lessons
and
science
lessons
which
are
specially
intended
to
cultivate
the
observing
faculty
this
fault
would
be
avoided
but
i
do
not
find
that
such
is
the
case
i
often
hear
lessons
on
objects
that
are
not
object
lessons
at
all
the
object
is
not
allowed
to
speak
for
itself
eloquent
though
it
is
and
capable
though
it
is
of
adapting
its
teaching
to
the
youngest
child
who
interrogates
it
the
teacher
buries
it
under
a
heap
of
words
and
statements
thereby
converting
the
object
lesson
into
a
verbal
lesson
and
throwing
away
golden
opportunities
of
forming
the
scientific
habit
of
mind
now
mental
science
teaches
us
that
our
knowledge
of
the
sensible
qualities
of
the
material
world
can
come
to
us
only
through
our
senses
and
through
the
right
senses
if
we
had
no
senses
we
should
know
nothing
about
the
material
world
at
all
if
we
had
a
sense
less
we
should
be
cut
off
from
a
whole
class
of
facts
if
we
had
as
many
senses
as
are
ascribed
to
the
inhabitants
of
sirius
in
novel
our
knowledge
would
be
proportionately
greater
than
it
is
now
words
can
not
compensate
for
sensations
the
eloquence
of
a
cicero
would
not
explain
to
a
deaf
man
what
music
is
or
to
a
blind
man
what
scarlet
is
yet
i
have
frequently
seen
teachers
wholly
disregard
these
obvious
truths
they
have
taught
as
though
their
pupils
had
eyes
that
saw
not
and
ears
that
heard
not
and
noses
that
smelled
not
and
palates
that
tasted
not
and
skins
that
felt
not
and
muscles
that
would
not
work
they
have
insisted
on
taking
the
words
out
of
mouth
and
speaking
for
her
they
have
thought
it
derogatory
to
play
a
subordinate
part
to
the
object
this
subject
has
been
well
treated
by
thos
balliet
in
a
paper
on
shortening
the
curriculum
york
school
says
he
of
two
kinds
studies
which
supply
the
mind
with
thoughts
of
images
and
those
which
give
us
the
means
of
indicating
and
so
communicating
thought
under
the
last
head
come
the
study
of
language
writing
including
spelling
notation
balliet
proposes
as
comenius
did
that
the
symbol
subjects
shall
not
be
taken
separately
but
in
connexion
with
the
thought
subjects
especially
in
the
we
should
study
language
for
thought
not
thought
for
the
sake
of
language
but
after
all
though
we
may
and
bring
the
young
in
connexion
with
the
objects
of
thought
and
not
with
words
merely
we
must
not
forget
that
the
scholastic
aspect
of
things
will
differ
from
the
practical
when
brought
into
the
schoolroom
the
thing
must
be
divested
of
details
and
surroundings
and
used
to
give
a
conception
of
one
of
a
class
the
fir
tree
of
the
schoolboy
can
not
be
the
fir
tree
of
the
the
becomes
a
cylinder
subject
to
internal
or
external
pressure
it
is
not
the
thing
that
the
knows
will
burn
and
corrode
get
foul
in
its
tubes
and
loose
in
its
joints
and
be
liable
to
burst
see
benton
on
and
theoretical
in
the
school
knowledge
of
things
no
less
than
of
words
may
easily
be
it
should
be
given
not
for
itself
but
to
excite
interest
and
draw
out
the
powers
of
the
mind
ruskin
seems
to
be
echoing
comenius
of
whom
perhaps
he
never
heard
when
he
says
be
taught
to
see
is
to
gain
word
and
thought
at
once
and
both
at
camb
sch
of
oct
as
far
as
my
experience
goes
there
are
few
men
capable
both
of
teaching
and
being
taught
and
of
these
rare
beings
comenius
was
a
noble
example
the
passage
in
which
he
acknowledges
his
obligation
to
the
is
a
striking
proof
of
his
candour
and
as
an
experiment
in
this
is
a
very
interesting
book
and
will
be
well
worth
a
note
from
augustin
and
alois
de
des
ecrivains
de
la
de
i
learn
that
the
author
william
bath
or
bathe
latin
bateus
was
born
in
dublin
in
and
died
in
madrid
in
brief
introduction
to
the
skill
of
song
as
set
forth
by
william
bathe
is
attributed
to
him
but
we
know
nothing
of
his
origin
or
occupation
till
he
entered
on
the
jesuit
noviciate
at
tournai
in
either
before
or
after
this
as
he
himself
tells
us
pleasant
race
of
at
beauvais
after
studying
at
padua
he
was
sent
as
spiritual
father
to
the
irish
college
at
salamanca
here
according
to
sommervogel
he
wrote
two
latin
books
he
also
designed
the
and
carried
out
the
plan
with
the
help
of
the
other
members
of
the
college
the
book
was
published
at
salamanca
de
cea
four
years
afterwards
an
edition
with
english
version
added
was
published
in
london
edited
by
wm
welde
i
have
never
seen
the
spanish
version
but
a
copy
of
edition
wanting
title
page
was
bequeathed
to
me
by
a
friend
honoured
by
all
students
of
education
joseph
payne
the
must
have
had
great
success
in
this
country
and
soon
had
other
editors
in
an
old
catalogue
i
have
seen
linguarum
or
a
messe
of
tongues
latine
english
french
spanish
neatly
served
up
together
for
a
wholesome
repast
to
the
worthy
curiositie
of
the
studious
sm
matthew
lowndes
this
must
have
been
the
early
edition
of
isaac
habrecht
i
have
his
linguarum
strassburg
and
in
the
preface
he
says
that
the
first
english
edition
came
out
in
and
that
he
had
added
a
french
version
and
published
the
book
at
london
in
four
languages
in
i
have
seen
edition
also
published
by
lowndes
and
edited
john
harmar
called
in
catalogue
of
british
museum
of
scholæ
sancti
albani
magistri
harmar
i
think
suppressed
all
mention
of
the
author
of
the
book
but
he
kept
the
title
this
seems
to
have
been
altered
by
the
celebrated
scioppius
who
published
the
book
as
grosippi
mercurius
this
is
one
of
the
most
interesting
experiments
in
language
teaching
i
ever
met
with
bathe
and
his
collected
as
they
believed
all
the
common
root
words
in
the
latin
language
and
these
they
worked
up
into
short
sentences
in
the
form
of
proverbs
after
the
sentences
follows
a
short
appendix
of
which
the
following
is
a
specimen
malum
comedis
juxta
malum
navis
de
malo
commisso
sub
malo
vetita
meditare
while
thou
eatest
an
apple
near
the
mast
of
a
ship
think
of
the
evil
committed
under
the
forbidden
apple
an
alphabetical
index
of
all
the
latin
words
is
then
given
with
the
number
of
the
sentence
in
which
the
word
occurs
prefixed
to
this
we
find
some
introductory
chapters
in
which
the
problem
what
is
the
best
way
of
learning
a
foreign
language
is
considered
and
some
advance
made
towards
a
solution
body
of
every
language
consisteth
of
four
principal
congruity
phrases
and
elegancy
the
dictionary
sets
down
the
words
grammar
the
congruities
authors
the
phrases
and
rhetoricians
with
their
figures
the
elegancy
we
call
phrases
the
proper
forms
or
peculiar
manners
of
speaking
which
every
tongue
chap
hitherto
says
bathe
there
have
been
in
use
only
two
ways
of
learning
a
language
such
as
is
grammar
to
observe
the
congruities
and
irregular
such
as
is
the
common
use
of
learners
by
reading
and
speaking
in
vulgar
the
way
is
more
certain
the
is
easier
so
bathe
has
planned
a
middle
way
which
is
to
combine
the
advantages
of
the
other
two
the
are
learnt
regularly
by
the
grammar
why
are
not
the
learned
regularly
by
the
dictionary
because
the
dictionary
contains
many
useless
words
because
compound
words
may
be
known
from
the
root
words
without
special
learning
because
words
as
they
stand
in
the
dictionary
bear
no
sense
and
so
can
not
be
remembered
by
the
use
of
this
all
these
objections
will
be
avoided
useful
words
and
root
words
only
are
given
and
they
are
worked
up
into
sentences
to
be
and
with
the
exception
of
a
few
little
words
such
as
no
word
occurs
a
second
time
thus
says
bathe
the
labour
of
learning
the
language
will
be
lightened
and
it
was
much
more
easy
to
have
known
all
the
living
creatures
by
often
looking
into
ark
wherein
was
a
selected
couple
of
each
kind
than
by
travelling
over
all
the
world
until
a
man
should
find
here
and
there
a
creature
of
each
kind
even
in
the
same
manner
will
all
the
words
be
far
more
easily
learned
by
use
of
these
sentences
than
by
hearing
speaking
or
reading
until
a
man
do
accidentally
meet
with
every
particular
proeme
hope
no
man
will
be
so
ingrateful
as
not
to
think
this
work
very
profitable
says
the
author
for
my
own
part
i
feel
grateful
for
such
an
earnest
attempt
at
of
the
curse
of
babylon
but
i
can
not
show
my
gratitude
by
declaring
work
very
the
attempt
to
squeeze
the
greater
part
of
a
language
into
short
sentences
could
produce
nothing
better
than
a
curiosity
the
language
could
not
be
thus
squeezed
into
the
memory
of
the
learner
this
book
must
have
had
a
great

in

lubinus
or
eilert
lueben
born
was
professor
first
of
poetry
then
of
theology
at
rostock
where
he
died
in
this
projector
of
the
most
famous
of
modern
times
seems
not
to
be
mentioned
in
great
at
least
in
the
first
edition
i
have
not
seen
the
second
i
find
from
that
ratke
declared
he
learnt
nothing
from
lubinus
while
comenius
recognised
him
gratefully
as
his
predecessor
this
is
just
what
we
should
have
expected
from
the
character
of
ratke
and
of
comenius
lubinus
advocated
the
use
of
interlinear
translations
and
published
says
sander
such
translations
of
the
new
testament
of
plautus
the
very
interesting
preface
to
the
new
was
translated
into
english
by
hartlib
and
published
as
true
and
readie
way
to
learne
the
latine
tongue
by
lubinus
the
date
given
for
preface
is
finds
fault
with
the
grammar
teaching
which
is
thrashed
into
boys
so
that
they
hate
their
masters
he
would
appeal
to
the
senses
from
these
things
falling
under
the
sense
of
the
eyes
and
as
it
were
more
known
we
will
make
entrance
and
begin
to
learn
the
latin
speech
living
creatures
creeping
things
fishes
and
birds
which
can
neither
be
gotten
nor
live
well
in
these
parts
ought
to
be
painted
others
also
which
because
of
their
bulk
and
greatness
can
not
be
shut
up
in
houses
may
be
made
in
a
lesser
form
or
drawn
with
the
pencil
yet
of
such
bigness
as
they
may
be
well
seen
by
boys
even
afar
he
says
he
has
often
counselled
the
stationers
to
bring
out
a
book
which
all
things
whatsoever
which
may
be
devised
and
written
and
seen
by
the
eyes
might
be
described
so
as
there
might
be
also
added
to
all
things
and
all
parts
and
members
of
things

own
proper
word
its
own

or

are
first
to
be
known
by
the
and
the
joining
of
seeing
the

and
hearing
the
name

by
far
the
profitablest
and
the
bravest
course

there
are
some
capital
hints
on
teaching
children

hadrianus
junius
has
made
a
that
may
be
useful
in
the
pictures
of
the
projected
book
there
are
to
be
lines
under
each
object
and
under
its
printed
name
the
excellent
device
of
corresponding
numbers
seems
due
to
comenius
for
printing
below
the
pictures
also
suggests
sentences
which
are
simpler
and
better
for
children
than
those
in
the
vestibulum
in
mensa
positus

vorat
in
the
brit
museum
there
is
a
copy
of
linguæ
in
which
works
up
the
root
words
of
greek
into
sentences
he
was
evidently
a
man
with
ideas
comenius
thought
of
them
so
highly
that
he
tried
to
carry
out
another

the
plan
of
a
or
roman
colony
in
which
no

should
be
used
but
latin

full
titles
of
the
books
referred
to

the
solitaries
of
used
to
vary
their
mental
toil
with
manual
a
jesuit
having
maliciously
asked
whether
it
was
true
that
monsieur
pascal
made
shoes
met
with
the
awkward
repartee
ne
sais
pas

des

mais
je
crois
a
porté
une
fameuse
a
master
in
a
great
public
school
once
stated
in
a
school
address
what
masters
and
boys
felt
to
be
true
would
hardly
be
too
much
to
say
that
the
whole
problem
of
education
is
how
to
surround
the
young
with
good
influences
i
believe
we
must
go
on
to
add
that
if
the
wisest
man
had
set
himself
to
work
out
this
problem
without
the
teaching
of
experience
he
would
have
been
little
likely
to
hit
upon
the
system
of
which
we
are
so
proud
and
which
we
call
public
school
if
the
real
secret
of
education
is
to
surround
the
young
with
good
influences
is
it
not
a
strange
paradox
to
take
them
at
the
very
age
when
influences
act
most
despotically
and
mass
them
together
in
large
numbers
where
much
that
is
coarsest
is
sure
to
be
tolerated
and
much
that
is
gentlest
and
most
presence
of
mothers
and
sisters
for
for
a
large
part
of
the
year
a
memory
or
an
echo
rather
than
a
living
voice
i
confess
i
have
never
seen
any
answers
to
this
objection
which
from
the
test
of
i
should
have
been
prepared
to
pronounce
satisfactory
it
is
a
simple
truth
that
the
moral
dangers
of
our
public
school
system
are
enormous
it
is
the
simple
truth
that
do
what
you
will
in
the
way
of
precaution
you
do
give
to
boys
of
low
animal
natures
the
very
boys
who
ought
to
be
exceptionally
subject
to
almost
despotic
restraint
exceptional
opportunities
of
exercising
a
debasing
influence
over
natures
far
more
refined
and
spiritual
than
their
own
and
it
is
further
the
simple
but
the
sad
truth
that
these
exceptional
opportunities
are
too
often
turned
to
account
and
that
the
young
character
for
a
for
a
long
spoiled
or
vulgarized
by
the
influence
of
unworthy
this
is
what
public
schoolmasters
if
their
eyes
are
not
blinded
by
routine
are
painfully
conscious
of
but
they
find
that
in
the
end
good
prevails
the
average
boy
gains
a
manly
character
and
contributes
towards
the
keeping
up
a
healthy
public
opinion
which
is
of
great
effect
in
restraining
the
number
of
boarders
was
never
very
great
because
to
a
master
were
assigned
no
more
than
he
could
have
beds
for

from

liveliness
they
seem

to

the

may
give
sufficient
care
to
each
individual
moreover
there
will
be
an
easy
avoidance

see
cadet
pp
ff
the
seem
to
me
in
some
respects
far
behind
comenius
but
they
were
right
in
rejecting
him
as
a
methodiser
in
lancelot
in
the
preface
to
his
of
greek
roots
says
that
the
of
comenius
is
totally
wanting
in
method
would
need
says
he
extraordinary
memory
and
from
my
experience
i
should
say
that
few
children
could
learn
this
book
for
it
is
long
and
difficult
and
as
the
words
in
it
are
not
repeated
those
at
the
beginning
would
be
forgotten
before
the
learner
reached
the
end
so
he
would
feel
a
constant
discouragement
because
he
would
always
find
himself
in
a
new
country
where
he
would
recognize
nothing
and
the
book
is
full
of
all
sorts
of
uncommon
and
difficult
words
and
the
first
chapters
throw
no
light
on
those
which
to
this
criticism
he
adds
to
the
to
deserve
its
name
should
be
nothing
but
a
short
and
simple
way
leading
us
as
soon
as
possible
to
read
the
best
books
in
the
language
so
that
we
might
not
only
acquire
the
words
we
are
in
need
of
but
also
all
that
is
most
characteristic
in
the
idiom
and
pure
in
the
phraseology
which
make
up
the
most
difficult
and
most
important
part
of
every
quoted
by
cadet
lemaître
a
nephew
of
la
mère
angélique
was
one
of
the
most
celebrated
orators
in
france
in
renouncing
the
world
for

retired
from
a
splendid
position
at
the
bar
such

qualifications
out
of
the
reach
of
ordinary
schoolmasters

in
after
years
told
how
when
he
was
a
boy
lemaître
called
him
often
to
his
room
and
gave
him
solid
instruction
in
learning
and
piety
read
to
me
and
made
me
read
pieces
from
poets
and
orators
and
saw
that
i
noticed
the
beauties
in
them
both
in
thought
and
diction
moreover
he
taught
me
the
right
emphasis
and
articulation
both
in
verse
and
prose
in
which
he
himself
was
admirable
having
the
charm
of
a
fine
voice
and
all
else
that
goes
to
make
a
great
orator
he
gave
me
also
many
rules
for
good
translation
and
for
making
my
progress
in
that
art
easy
to
quoted
by
cadet
p
it
was
lemaître
who
instructed
racine
born

at
les
granges
port
royal
des

in
in
the
general
of
the
jesuits
issued
a
letter
to
the
society
against
the
cartesian
philosophy
the
university
in
this
agreed
with
its
rivals
and
petitioned
the
parliament
to
prohibit
the
cartesian
teaching
this
produced
the
burlesque
by
boileau
it
is
stated
that
for
some
years
past
a
stranger
named
reason
has
endeavoured
to
make
entry
by
force
into
the
schools
of
the
university
where
aristotle
has
always
been
acknowledged
as
judge
without
appeal
and
not
accountable
for
his
opinions
be
it
known
by
these
presents
that
this
court
has
maintained
and
kept
and
does
maintain
and
keep
the
said
aristotle
in
perfect
and
peaceable
possession
of
the
said
schools
and
in
order
that
for
the
future
he
may
not
be
interfered
with
in
them
it
has
banished
reason
for
ever
from
the
schools
of
the
said
university
and
forbids
his
entry
to
disturb
and
disquiet
the
said
aristotle
in
the
possession
and
enjoyment
of
the
aforesaid
schools
under
pain
and
penalty
of
being
declared
a
jansenist
and
a
lover
of
quoted
by
cadet
p
although
so
much
time
is
given
to
the
study
of
words
practice
in
the
use
of
words
is
almost
entirely
neglected
and
the
english
schoolboy
remains
inarticulate
rollin
somewhat
extends
statement
desire
of
learning
rests
in
the
will
which
you
can
not
about
attempts
to
coerce
the
will
in
the
absence
of
interest
i
may
quote
a
passage
from
a
lecture
of
mine
at
birmingham
in
when
i
did
not
know
that
i
had
behind
me
such
high
authorities
as
quintilian
and
rollin
should
divide
the
powers
of
the
mind
that
may
be
cultivated
in
the
into
two
classes
in
the
first
i
should
put
all
the
higher
of
meaning
perception
of
analogy
observation
reflection
imagination
intellectual
memory
in
the
other
class
is
one
power
only
and
that
is
a
kind
of
memory
that
depends
on
the
association
of
sounds
how
is
it
then
that
in
most
far
more
time
is
spent
in
cultivating
this
last
and
power
than
all
the
rest
put
together
the
explanation
is
easy
all
the
higher
powers
can
be
exercised
only
when
the
pupils
are
interested
or
as
thring
puts
it
for
what
they
are
the
memory
that
depends
on
associating
sounds
is
independent
of
interest
and
can
be
secured
by
simple
repetition
now
it
is
very
hard
to
awaken
interest
and
still
harder
to
maintain
it
that
wand
the
cane
with
which
the
schoolmasters
of
olden
time
worked
such
wonders
is
powerless
here
or
powerful
only
in
the
negative
direction
and
so
is
every
form
of
punishment
you
may
tell
a
you
say
your
lesson
you
shall
stay
in
and
write
it
out
times
and
the
threat
may
have
effect
but
no
from
orbilius
downwards
has
ever
thought
of
saying
you
take
an
interest
in
your
work
keep
you
in
till
you
do
so
teachers
very
naturally
prefer
the
kind
of
teaching
in
which
they
can
make
sure
of
here
as
usual
rollin
uses
quintilian
without
directly
quoting
him
he
gives
in
a
note
the
passage
he
had
in
his
mind
imprimis

pestalozzi

froebel
were
also
in
this
sense
realists
but
they
held
that
the
educational
value
of
knowledge
lay
not
in
itself
but
only
in
so
far
as
it
was
an
instrument
for
developing
the
faculties
of
the
mind
henry

a
very
interesting

if

were
more
active

in

in

affairs
of

life
as

as
in
speculative
opinions
disposed
to
follow
reason
whosoever
it
were
that
suggested
it
he
being
ever
a
faithful
servant
i
had
almost
said
a
slave
to
truth
never
abandoning
her
for
anything
else
and
following
her
for
her
own
sake
quoted
by

it
is
one
thing
to
desire
truth
and
another
to
think
own
reasoning
power
the
sole
means
of
obtaining
it
am
far
from
imagining
myself
infallible
but
yet
i
should
be
loth
to
differ
from
any
thinking
man
being
fully
persuaded
there
are
very
few
things
of
pure
speculation
wherein
two
thinking
men
who
impartially
seek
truth
can
differ

they
give
themselves

you

not

i
think
any
two

used
to
think
with
freedom
who
really
prefer
truth
to
opiniatrety

a
little
foolish
of
not
having
made
a

carlyle
thine

have
got
to

thine
own

victoriously

by

alas
it

about

and
fight
about

till
thou
die
striving
to

and
all
men
how
much
it
is
thine
not
is
thine

only
a

it

much
the

how
a

can
content
himself

it
would
be
difficult
to
find
a

more

good
sense
than
the

derby
or
whether
we
say
it
in
praise
or
dispraise
a
man
less
like
rousseau
so
it
is
interesting
to
find
him
in
agreement
with
rousseau
in
condemning
the
ordinary
restraints
of

are
beginning
to
find
out
what
if
they
would
use
their
own
observation
more
and
not
follow
one
another
like
sheep
they
would
have
found
out
long
ago
that
it
is
doing
positive
harm
to
a
young
child
mental
and
bodily
harm
to
keep
it
learning
or
pretending
to
learn
the
greater
part
of
the
day
nature
says
to
a
child
about
the
schoolmaster
says
still
and
as
the
schoolmaster
can
punish
on
the
spot
and
nature
only
long
afterwards
he
is
obeyed
and
health
and
brain
in
all
this
is
very
crude
and
so
is
the
artifice
by
which
julie
in
the
entraps
her
son
into
learning
to
read
no
doubt
rousseau
is
right
when
he
says
that
where
there
is
a
desire
to
read
the
power
is
sure
to
come
but
is
one
thing
in
the
lives
of
the
labouring
classes
to
whom
it
means
reading
aloud
in
school
and
quite
another
in
families
of
literary
tastes
and
habits
with
whom
the
range
of
thought
is
in
a
great
measure
dependent
on
books
in
such
families
the
children
learn
to
read
as
surely
as
they
learn
to
talk
they
mostly
have
access
to
books
which
they
read
to
themselves
for
pleasure
and
of
course
it
is
absurdly
untrue
to
say
that
they
learn
nothing
but
words
and
do
not
think
in
my
opinion
it
may
be
questioned
whether
the
world
of
fiction
into
which
their
reading
gives
them
the
does
not
withdraw
them
too
much
from
the
actual
world
in
which
they
live
the
elders
find
it
very
convenient
when
the
child
can
always
be
depended
on
to
amuse
himself
with
a
book
but
noise
and
motion
contribute
more
to
health
of
body
and
perhaps
of
mind
also
while
children
of
parents
often
read
too
much
the
children
of
our
schools
hardly
get
a
notion
what
reading
is
in
these
schools
always
stands
for
vocal
reading
and
the
power
and
the
habit
of
using
books
for
pleasure
or
for
knowledge
other
than
verbal
are
little
cultivated

may
say
of

yet
he
himself
testifies

it
is
the
exercise
of
the

carries
the

of

he
asserts
in
his
fitful
way
that
there
is
inborn
in
the
heart
of
man
a
feeling
of
what
is
just
and
unjust
again
after
all
his
praise
of
negation
he
contradicts
himself

says

is
well
discussed
by
girardin

the
following
passage
is
striking
is
it
that
madame
understood
the
child
better
than
rousseau
did
she
saw
in
the
child
two
things
a
creation
and
a
something
finished
and
something
begun
a
perfection
which
prepares
the
way
for
another

a
child
and
a
man

who
has
put
together
human
life
in
several
pieces
has
willed
it
is
true
that
all
these
pieces
should
be
related
to
each
other
but
he
has
also
willed
that
each
of
them
should
be
complete
in
itself
so
that
every
stage
of
life
has
what
it
needs
as
the
object
of
that
period
and
also
what
it
needs
to
bring
in
the
period
that
comes
next
wonderful
union
of
aims
and
means
which
shews
itself
at
every
step
in
creation
in
everything
there
is
aim

also
means
everything
exists
for
itself
and
also

has
not
met
with
some
experience
such
as
a
child
with
an
active
and
inquiring
mind
accustomed
to
chatter
about
everything
that
interests
him
is
sent
to
school
in
a
few
weeks
his
vivacity
is
extinguished
his
abundance
of
talk
has
dried
up
if
you
ask
him
about
his
studies
if
you
desire
him
to
give
you
a
specimen
of
what
he
has
learnt
he
repeals
to
you
in
a
voice
some
rule
for
the
formation
of
tenses
or
some
recipe
for
spelling
words
such
are
the
results
of
the
teaching
which
should
be
of
all
teaching
the
most
fruitful
and
the
most
attractive
translated
from
by
bréal
in
these
visits
he
observed
how
the
children
suffered
from
working
in
factories
these
observations
influenced
him
in
after
years
in
these
aphorisms
pestalozzi
states
the
main
principles
at
work
in
his
own
mind
but
this
bare
statement
is
not
well
suited
to
communicate
these
principles
to
the
minds
of
others
for
most
readers
the
aphorisms
have
as
little
attraction
as
the
enunciations
say
of
a
book
of
euclid
would
have
for
those
who
knew
no
geometry
but
as
his
future
life
was
guided
by
the
principles
he
has
formulated
in
this
paper
it
seems
necessary
for
us
to
bear
some
of
these
in
mind
what
he
mainly
insists
upon
is
that
all
wise
guidance
must
proceed
from
a
knowledge
of
the
nature
of
the
creature
to
be
guided
further
that
there
is
a
simple
wisdom
which
must
direct
the
course
of
all
men
path
of
nature
says
he
brings
out
the
powers
of
men
must
be
open
and
plain
and
human
education
to
true
wisdom
must
be
simple
and
available
for
all
nature
brings
out
all
powers
by
practice
and
their
increase
springs
from
the
powers
of
children
should
be
strengthened
by
exercise
on
what
is
close
at
hand
and
this
should
be
done
without
hardness
or
pressure
a
forced
and
rigid
sequence
in
instruction
is
not
method
says
he
this
would
make
men
and
truth
would
not
penetrate
freely
and
softly
into
their
whole
being
the
pure
feeling
for
truth
grows
in
a
small
area
and
human
wisdom
must
be
grounded
on
a
perception
of
our
closest
relationships
and
must
show
itself
in
skilled
management
of
our
nearest
concerns
everything
we
do
against
our
consciousness
of
right
weakens
our
perception
of
truth
and
disturbs
the
purity
of
our
fundamental
conceptions
and
experiences
on
this
account
all
wisdom
of
man
rests
in
the
strength
of
a
good
heart
that
follows
after
truth
and
all
the
blessing
of
man
in
the
sense
of
simplicity
and
innocence
peace
of
mind
must
be
the
outcome
of
right
training
to
get
out
of
his
surroundings
all
he
needs
for
life
and
enjoyment
to
be
patient
painstaking
and
in
every
difficulty
trustful
in
the
love
of
the
heavenly
father
this
comes
of
a
true
education
to
wisdom
nothing
concerns
the
human
race
so
closely
and
intimately
as
father
of
thy
household
as
source
of
thy
as
thy
father
in
this
belief
thou
findest
rest
and
strength
and
wisdom
which
no
violence
nor
the
grave
itself
can
belief
in
god
which
is
a
part
of
our
nature
like
the
sense
of
right
and
wrong
and
the
feeling
we
can
never
quench
of
what
is
just
and
unjust
must
be
made
the
foundation
in
educating
the
human
race
the
subject
of
that
belief
is
that
god
is
the
father
of
men
men
are
the
children
of
god
to
this
divine
relationship
pestalozzi
refers
all
human
relationships
as
those
of
parent
and
child
of
ruler
and
subject
the
priest
is
appointed
to
declare
the
fatherhood
of
god
and
the
brotherhood
of
men
the
only
text
i
have
seen
is
that
reprinted
by
raumer
from
otto
fischer
i
learn
that
this
is
the
edition
of
which
differs
at
least
by
omission
from
the
original
of
there
are
now
four
parts
first
published
respectively
in
and
fischer
the
english
translation
in
two
small
vols
ends
with
the
first
part
but
miss
eva
channing
has
recently
sought
to
weld
the
four
parts
into
one
boston
heath
and
in
this
form
the
book
seems
to
me
not
only
very
instructive
but
very
entertaining
also
not
many
readers
who
look
into
it
will
fail
to
reach
the
end
and
few
are
the
books
connected
with
education
of
which
this
could
prudently
be
asserted
good
teachers
should
read
it
with
care
says
stanley
hall
in
his
introduction
and
if
they
thus
read
it
and
catch
anything
of
the
spirit
of
pestalozzi
both
they
and
their
pupils
will
have
reason
to
rejoice
in
the
pages
of
this
journal
pestalozzi
taught
that
it
was
domestic
virtues
which
determine
the
happiness
of
a
again
he
says
the
throne
and
in
the
cottage
man
has
equal
need
of
religion
and
becomes
the
most
wretched
being
on
the
earth
if
he
forget
his
child
at
his
breast
is
weaker
and
more
dependent
than
any
creature
on
earth
and
yet
he
already
feels
the
first
moral
impressions
of
love
and
is
nothing
but
a
result
of
the
development
of
the
first
sentiments
of
love
and
gratitude
felt
by
the
the
first
development
of
the
powers
should
come
from
his
participation
in
the
work
of
his
home
for
this
work
is
what
his
parents
understand
best
what
most
absorbs
their
attention
and
what
they
can
best
teach
but
even
if
this
were
not
so
work
undertaken
to
supply
real
needs
would
be
just
as
truly
the
surest
foundation
of
a
good
education
engage
the
attention
of
the
child
to
exercise
his
judgment
to
raise
his
heart
to
noble
sentiments
these
i
think
the
chief
ends
of
and
how
can
these
ends
be
reached
so
surely
as
by
training
the
child
as
early
as
possible
in
the
various
daily
duties
of
domestic
life
it
would
seem
then
that
at
this
time
pestalozzi
was
for
basing
education
on
domestic
labour
and
would
teach
the
child
to
be
useful
but
it
is
hard
to
see
how
this
principle
could
always
be
applied
one
of
these
i
have
already
given
i
will
give
another
not
as
by
any
means
one
of
the
best
but
as
a
fit
companion
to
the
two
colts
colts
as
like
as
two
eggs
fell
into
different
hands
one
was
bought
by
a
peasant
whose
only
thought
was
to
harness
it
to
his
plough
as
soon
as
possible
this
one
turned
out
a
bad
horse
the
other
fell
to
the
lot
of
a
man
who
by
looking
after
it
well
and
training
it
carefully
made
a
noble
steed
of
it
strong
and
mettlesome
fathers
and
mothers
if
your
faculties
are
not
carefully
trained
and
directed
right
they
will
become
not
only
useless
but
hurtful
and
the
greater
the
faculties
the
greater
the
compare
rousseau
look
at
those
two
dogs
they
are
of
the
same
litter
they
have
been
brought
up
and
treated
precisely
alike
they
have
never
been
separated
and
yet
one
of
them
is
sharp
lively
affectionate
and
very
intelligent
the
other
is
dull
lumpish
surly
and
nobody
could
ever
teach
him
anything
simply
a
difference
of
temperament
has
produced
in
them
a
difference
of
character
just
as
a
simple
difference
of
our
interior
organisation
produces
in
us
a
difference

lettre
iii
pestalozzi
was
with
the
children
at
stanz
only
during
the
first
half
of
as
pestalozzi
wrote
to
gessner
gertrude
see
is
not
always
entirely
wrong
i
really
could
not
write
properly
nor
read
nor
reckon
but
people
always
jump
to
wrong
conclusions
from
such
at
stanz
you
saw
that
i
could
teach
writing
without
myself
being
able
to
write
he
here
anticipates
a
paradox
of
years
afterwards
napoleon
though
he
could
not
foresee
sedan
got
a
notion
that
after
all
there
was
in
pestalozzi
and
that
the
aim
of
the
system
was
to
put
the
freedom
and
development
of
the
individual
in
the
place
of
the
mechanical
routine
of
the
old
schools
which
tended
to
produce
a
mass
of
dull
uniformity
with
this
aim
as
guimps
says
napoleon
was
quite
out
of
sympathy
and
whenever
the
subject
was
mentioned
he
would
say
pestalozzians
are
thus
very
inaccurately
expressing
an
accurate
notion
that
there
was
more
in
them
than
could
be
understood
at
the
first
glance
pestalozzi
had
from
this
country
some
more
discerning
visitors
greaves
to
whom
pestalozzi
addressed
which
were
translated
and
published
in
this
country
also
mayo
who
was
at
yverdun
with
his
pupils
for
three
years
from
and
afterwards
conducted
a
celebrated
pestalozzian
school
at
cheam
mayo
in
lectured
on
system
at
the
royal
institution
sir
jas
and
tufnell
also
drew
attention
to
it
in
the
of
council
on
the
disciple
is
not
above
his
master
and
if
parents
and
teachers
are
without
sympathy
and
religious
feeling
the
children
will
also
be
without
faith
and
love
this
can
not
be
urged
too
strongly
on
those
who
have
charge
of
the
young
but
there
is
no
test
by
which
we
can
ascertain
that
a
master
has
these
essential
qualifications
as
in
the
christian
ministry
the
unfit
can
be
shut
out
only
by
their
own
consciences
but
let
no
one
think
to
understand
education
if
he
loses
sight
of
what
joseph
payne
has
called

but
profound

says
carlyle
religion
the
first
thing
needful
and
also
the
last
and
only
thing
is
finding
of
a
man
who
religion
all
else
in
a
congress
in
which
more
than
german
elementary
teachers
were
represented
petitioned
the
prussian
government
for
organization
of
training
schools
in
accordance
with
the
pedagogic
principles
of
pestalozzi
which
formerly
enjoyed
so
much
favour
in
prussia
and
so
visibly
contributed
to
the
regeneration
of
the
did
pestalozzi
make
due
allowance
for
the
system
of
thought
which
every
child
inherits
croom
robertson
in
we
came
by
our
no
march
without
mentioning
pestalozzi
seems
to
differ
from
him
croom
robertson
says
that
being
born
into
the
world
are
born
into
society
and
are
acted
on
by
overpowering
social
influences
before
they
have
any
chance
of
being
their
proper
selves
the
words
and
sentences
that
fall
upon
a
ear
and
are
soon
upon
his
lips
express
not
so
much
his
subjective
experience
as
the
common
experience
of
his
kind
which
becomes
as
it
were
an
objective
rule
or
measure
to
which
his
shall
conform
he
does
he
must
accept
what
he
is
told
and
in
general
he
is
only
too
glad
to
find
his
own
experience
in
accordance
with
it
we
use
our
incidental
by
which
i
mean
our
natural
subjective
experience
mainly
to
decipher
and
verify
the
scheme
of
knowledge
that
is
given
us
with
the
words
of
our
pp
one
of
the
most
interesting
and
most
difficult
problems
in
teaching
is
this
long
should
the
beginner
be
kept
to
the
rudiments
with
young
children
to
whom
ideas
come
fast
the
main
thing
is
no
doubt
to
take
care
that
these
ideas
become
distinct
and
are
made
intellectual
of
the
learners
but
after
a
year
or
two
children
will
be
impatient
to
on
and
if
they
seem
will
be
bored
and
discouraged
then
again
in
some
subjects
the
elementary
parts
seem
clear
only
to
those
who
have
a
conception
of
the
whole
as
diderot
says
in
a
passage
i
have
seen
quoted
from
neveu
de
faut
être
profond
dans
ou
dans
la
science
pour
en
bien
posséder
les

the
greatest
in
cambridge
used
to
his
men
through
their
subjects
and
then
go
back
again
for
thorough
learning
to
be
sure
the
suitable
for
young
men
differs
greatly
from
the
or
of
investigation
which
is
best
for
children
see
joseph
lecture
on
pestalozzi
but
even
with
children
we
should
bear
in
mind
caution
itself
may
become
superficial
by
exaggeration
for
it
may
keep
too
long
to
a
part
and
in
this
way
fail
to
complete
and
give
any
notion
of
the
quoted
by
fischer
nearly
years
ago
appeared
a
paper
on
national
in
which
parkin
advocated
making
all
our
elementary
schools
industrial
not
only
for
practical
purposes
but
still
more
for
the
sake
of
physical
education
the
paper
attracted
no
notice
at
the
time
but
now
we
are
beginning
to
see
that
the
body
is
concerned
in
education
as
well
as
the
mind
and
that
the
mind
learns
through
it
the
application
of
this
truth
will
bring
about
many
changes
herbart
when
he
visited
pestalozzi
at
burgdorf
observed
that
though
kindness
was
apparent
to
all
he
took
no
pains
in
his
teaching
to
mix
the
with
the
he
never
talked
to
the
children
or
joked
or
gave
them
an
anecdote
this
however
did
not
surprise
herbart
whose
own
experience
had
taught
him
that
when
the
subject
requires
earnest
attention
the
children
do
not
like
it
the
better
for
the
feeling
of
clear
apprehension
says
he
held
to
be
the
only
genuine
condiment
of
ed
by
willmann
j
look
to
himself
but
there
may
be
other
causes
of
failure
as
well
the
great
thing
is
never
to
put
up
contentedly
or
even
discontentedly
with
failure
in
teaching
classes
of
lads
from
ten
to
sixteen
years
old
when
i
have
found
the
lessons
in
any
subject
were
not
going
well
i
have
sometimes
taken
the
class
into
my
confidence
told
them
that
they
no
doubt
felt
as
i
did
that
this
lesson
was
a
dull
one
and
asked
them
each
to
put
on
paper
what
he
considered
to
be
the
reasons
and
also
to
make
any
suggestions
that
occurred
to
him
in
this
way
i
have
got
some
very
good
hints
and
i
have
always
been
helped
in
my
effort
to
understand
how
the
work
seemed
to
the
pupils
every
teacher
should
make
this
effort
as
pestalozzi
says
we
conceive
the
indescribable
tedium
which
must
oppress
the
young
mind
while
the
weary
hours
are
slowly
passing
away
one
after
another
in
occupations
which
it
can
neither
relish
nor
understand
we
should
no
longer
be
surprised
at
the
remissness
of
the
schoolboy
creeping
like
snail
unwillingly
to
to
xxx
with
it
is
interesting
to
compare
joseph
given
at
the
end
of
his
lecture
on
i
the
principles
of
education
are
not
to
be
devised
they
are
to
be
sought
for
in
human
nature
ii
this
nature
is
an
organic
plexus
of
bodily
intellectual
and
moral
capabilities
ready
for
development
and
struggling
to
develop
themselves
iii
the
education
conducted
by
the
formal
educator
has
both
a
negative
and
a
positive
side
the
negative
function
of
the
educator
consists
in
removing
impediments
so
as
to
afford
free
scope
for
the
his
positive
function
is
to
stimulate
the
learner
to
the
exercise
of
his
powers
to
furnish
materials
and
occasion
for
the
exercise
and
to
superintend
and
maintain
the
action
of
the
machinery
iv
begins
with
the
impressions
received
by
the
mind
from
external
objects
these
impressions
called
sensations
when
the
mind
becomes
conscious
of
them
group
themselves
into
perceptions
these
are
registered
in
the
mind
as
conceptions
or
ideas
and
constitute
that
elementary
knowledge
which
is
the
basis
of
all
knowledge
spontaneity
and
are
the
necessary
conditions
under
which
the
mind
educates
itself
and
gains
power
and
independence
vi
practical
aptness
or
faculty
depends
more
on
habits
gained
by
the
assiduous
exercise
of
the
active
powers
than
on
knowledge
alone
knowing
and
doing
und
must
however
proceed
together
the
chief
aim
of
all
education
including
instruction
is
the
development
of
the
powers
vii
all
education
including
instruction
must
be
grounded
on
the
own
observation
at
first
his
own
personal
experience
this
is
the
true
basis
of
all
his
knowledge
first
the
reality
then
the
symbol
first
the
thing
then
the
word
not
viii
that
which
the
learner
has
gained
by
his
own
observation
and
which
as
a
part
of
his
personal
experience
is
incorporated
with
his
mind
he
and
can
describe
or
explain
in
his
own
words
his
competency
to
do
this
is
the
measure
of
the
accuracy
of
his
observation
and
consequently
of
his
knowledge
ix
personal
experience
necessitates
the
advancement
of
the
mind
from
the
near
and
actual
with
which
he
is
in
contact
and
which
he
can
deal
with
himself
to
the
more
remote
therefore
from
the
concrete
to
the
abstract
from
particulars
to
generals
from
the
known
to
the
unknown
this
is
the
method
of
elementary
education
the
opposite
usual
proceeding
of
our
traditional
the
mind
from
the
abstract
to
the
concrete
from
generals
to
particulars
from
the
unknown
to
the
known
this
latter
is
the
scientific
method
suited
only
to
the
advanced
learner
who
it
assumes
is
already
trained
by
the
elementary
method
most
parents
do
not
seem
to
think
with
jean
paul
we
regard
all
life
as
an
educational
institution
a
circumnavigator
of
the
world
is
less
influenced
by
all
the
nations
he
has
seen
than
by
his
quoted
in
i
will
quote
the
first
paragraph
of
this
work
which
is
still
considered
mental
pabulum
suited
to
the
digestions
of
young
ladies
and
children
some
of
the
most
ancient
babylonia
assyria
china
in
asia
and
egypt
in
africa
nimrod
the
grandson
of
ham
is
supposed
to
have
founded
the
first
of
these
as
well
as
the
famous
cities
of
babylon
and
nineveh
his
kingdom
being
within
the
fertile
plains
of
chaldēa
chalonītis
and
assyria
was
of
small
extent
compared
with
the
vast
empires
that
afterwards
arose
from
it
but
included
several
large
cities
in
the
district
called
babylonia
were
the
cities
of
babylon
barsīta
idicarra
and
vologsia
i
shall
always
feel
gratitude
and
affection
for
the
two
old
ladies
sisters
to
whom
i
was
entrusted
over
half
a
century
ago
more
truly
christian
women
i
never
met
with
but
of
the
science
and
art
of
education
they
were
totally
ignorant
and
moreover
the
premises
they
occupied
were
unfit
for
a
school
as
all
the
boys
were
under
ten
years
old
it
will
seem
strange
but
is
alas
too
true
that
there
were
vices
among
them
which
are
supposed
to
be
unknown
to
children
and
which
if
discovered
would
have
made
the
old
ladies
close
their
school
the
want
of
subjects
in
which
the
children
can
take
a
healthy
interest
will
in
a
great
measure
account
for
the
spread
of
evil
in
such
schools
on
this
point
some
mistresses
and
most
parents
are
dangerously
ignorant
having
watched
the
of
i
find
that
some
of
them
i
may
say
many
never
address
more
than
one
child
at
a
time
and
never
attempt
to
gain
the
attention
of
more
than
a
single
child
so
by
a
very
simple
calculation
we
can
get
at
the
maximum
time
each
child
is
if
the
has
but
of
the
pupils
for
whom
the
department
supposes
him
each
child
can
not
be
under
instruction
than
two
minutes
in
the
hour
the
rest
of
the
time
the
children
must
sit
quiet
or
be
cuffed
if
they
do
not
what
is
called
teaching
in
say
reading
consists
in
the
reading
from
the
book
and
as
he
pronounces
each
word
the
children
shout
it
after
him
but
no
one
except
the
knows
the
place
in
the
book
but
perhaps
the
dangers
from
employing
boys
and
girls
to
teach
and
govern
children
are
greater
morally
than
intellectually
whether
he
report
on
it
or
not
the
inspector
has
less
influence
on
the
moral
training
than
the
youngest
channing
has
well
said
child
compelled
for
six
hours
each
day
to
see
the
countenance
and
hear
the
voice
of
an
unfeeling
petulant
passionate
unjust
teacher
is
placed
in
a
school
of
those
who
have
never
taught
day
after
day
week
after
week
month
after
month
little
know
what
demands
makes
on
the
temper
and
the
sense
of
justice
the
harshest
tyrants
are
usually
those
who
are
raised
but
a
little
way
above
those
whom
they
have
to
control
and
when
i
think
of
the
with
his
forty
pupils
to
keep
in
order
i
heartily
pity
both
him
and
them
is
there
not
too
much
reason
to
fear
lest
in
many
cases
the
school
should
prove
for
both
what
channing
has
well
described
as
school
of
in
march
since
the
above
was
written
another
has
appeared
march
in
which
the
system
of
measuring
by
a
system
maintained
in
spite
of
the
remonstrances
of
all
interested
in
for
nearly
years
is
at
length
abandoned
we
are
certainly
travelling
however
slowly
away
from
lowe
far
as
we
are
still
from
pestalozzi
there
seems
reason
to
hope
that
the
distance
is
diminishing
this
short
sketch
of
life
is
mainly
taken
with
permission
from
the
for
which
i
wrote
it
this
office
was
first
filled
by
langethal
and
afterwards
by
ferdinand
froebel
i
learned
this
at
burgdorf
from
herr
pfarrer
heuer
whose
father
had
himself
been
waisenvater
for
this
quotation
and
for
much
besides
as
will
appear
later
on
i
am
indebted
to
courthope
bowen
see
his
paper
education
of
the
educator
has
his
activity
limited
according
to
degarmo
to
these
two
things
the
of
the
mind
for
a
rapid
and
effective
assimilation
of
new
knowledge
the
of
the
matter
of
instruction
in
such
order
and
manner
as
will
best
conduce
to
the
most
effective
of
by
chas
degarmo
boston
heath
besides
this
he
must
make
his
pupils
their
knowledge
both
new
and
old
and
reproduce
it
in
fresh
connexions
children
says
joseph
payne
scarcely
ever
contented
with
simply
doing
nothing
and
their
fidgetiness
and
unrest
which
often
give
mothers
and
teachers
so
much
anxiety
are
merely
the
strugglings
of
the
soul
to
get
through
the
body
some
employment
for
its
powers
supply
this
want
give
them
an
object
to
work
upon
and
you
solve
the
problem
the
divergence
and
distraction
of
the
faculties
cease
as
they
converge
upon
the
work
and
the
mind
is
at
rest
in
its
very
to
german
i
entirely
agree
with
joseph
payne
that
where
the
language
spoken
is
not
german
it
would
be
well
to
discard
and
all
who
have
to
do
with
children
should
master
some
great
principles
taught
by
froebel
but
there
is
no
need
for
them
to
learn
german
or
to
use
german
words
the
french
seem
satisfied
with
but
we
are
not
likely
to
be
with
do
contrast
this
with
what
has
been
said
by
an
eminent
thinker
of
our
time
art
of
equal
importance
to
mankind
has
been
so
little
investigated
scientifically
as
the
art
of
sir
maine
quoted
in

notion
of

reminds
one
of

quotes
from
of
the
lowest
kind
is
knowledge
science
is
knowledge
philosophy
is
as
i
have
said
above
these
methodizers
in
may
with
regard
to
the
first
stage
be
divided
into
two
parties
which
i
have
called
and
two
complete
retainers
robertson
and
prendergast
have
as
it
seems
to
me
made
since
jacotot
a
great
advance
on
his
method
and
that
of
his
predecessor
ascham
as
i
have
had
a
good
deal
of
experience
with
beginners
in
german
i
will
give
from
an
old
lecture
of
mine
the
main
conclusions
at
which
i
have
arrived
principle
is
to
attack
the
most
vital
part
of
the
language
and
at
first
to
keep
the
area
small
or
rather
to
enlarge
it
very
slowly
but
within
that
area
i
want
to
get
as
much
variety
as
possible
the
study
of
a
book
written
in
the
language
should
be
carried
on
with
drill
in
its
common
inflexions
now
arises
the
question
should
the
book
be
made
with
the
object
of
teaching
the
language
or
should
it
be
selected
from
those
written
for
other
purposes
i
see
much
to
be
said
on
either
side
the
three
great
facts
we
have
to
turn
to
account
in
teaching
a
language
are
these
a
few
words
recur
so
constantly
that
a
knowledge
of
them
and
grasp
of
them
gives
us
a
power
in
the
language
quite
out
of
proportion
to
their
number
second
large
classes
of
words
admit
of
many
variations
of
meaning
by
inflection
which
variations
we
can
understand
from
analogy
third
compound
words
are
formed
on
simple
laws
so
that
the
root
word
supplies
the
key
to
a
whole
family
now
if
the
book
is
written
by
the
he
has
the
whole
language
before
him
and
he
can
make
the
most
of
all
these
advantages
he
can
use
only
the
important
words
of
the
language
he
can
repeat
them
in
various
connections
he
can
bring
the
main
facts
of
inflection
and
construction
before
the
learner
in
a
regular
order
which
is
a
great
assistance
to
the
memory
he
can
give
the
simple
words
before
introducing
words
compounded
of
them
and
he
can
provide
that
when
a
word
occurs
for
the
first
time
the
learners
shall
connect
it
with
its
root
meaning
a
short
book
securing
all
these
advantages
would
no
doubt
be
a
very
useful
implement
but
i
have
never
seen
such
a
book
almost
all
delectuses
bury
the
learner
with
a
pile
of
new
words
under
which
he
feels
himself
powerless
so
far
as
i
know
the
book
has
yet
to
be
written
and
even
if
it
were
written
with
the
greatest
success
from
a
linguistic
point
of
view
it
would
of
course
make
no
pretension
to
a
meaning
having
myself
gone
through
a
course
of
ahn
and
of
ollendorf
i
remember
as
a
sort
of
nightmare
innumerable
questions
and
answers
such
as
you
my
thread
stockings
no
i
have
your
worsted
still
more
repulsive
are
the
long
sentences
of
prendergast
much
must
i
give
to
the
cabdriver
to
take
my
father
to
the
bank
in
new
street
before
his
second
breakfast
and
to
bring
him
home
again
before
two
i
can
not
forget
which
has
a
good
deal
of
truth
in
it
way
is
good
but
the
tiresome
and
most
of
the
books
written
for
beginners
are
inexpressibly
tiresome
no
doubt
it
will
be
said
you
adopt
the
plan
any
book
be
tiresome
what
is
a
meaning
at
first
becomes
no
meaning
by
frequent
this
however
is
not
altogether
true
i
myself
have
taught
for
years
and
i
know
some
chapters
by
heart
but
the
old
tales
of
jason
and
hercules
as
they
are
told
in
simple
language
do
not
bore
me
in
the
least
begriff
muss
bei
dem
worte
sein
says
the
student
in
faust
and
a
very
pleasing
notion
to
me
about
every
word
in
the
these
then
would
be
my
books
to
be
worked
at
the
same
time
by
a
beginner
say
in
german
book
for
drill
in
the
principal
inflexions
followed
by
the
main
facts
about
gender
and
a
book
like
the
this
i
would
have
prepared
very
much
after
the
robertsonian
manner
it
should
be
printed
as
should
also
the
primer
in
roman
type
though
in
an
appendix
some
of
it
should
be
reprinted
in
german
type
the
book
should
be
divided
into
short
lessons
a
translation
of
each
lesson
should
be
given
in
parallel
columns
then
should
come
a
vocabulary
in
which
all
useful
information
should
be
given
about
the
really
important
words
unimportant
words
being
finally
should
come
and
exercises
in
the
lessons
and
in
these
the
important
words
of
that
and
previous
lessons
should
be
used
exclusively
the
exercises
should
be
such
as
the
pupils
could
do
in
writing
out
of
school
and
in
school
they
should
be
very
exercises
in
what
is
already
known
not
a
series
of
linguistic
puzzles
the
object
of
the
exercises
and
also
of
a
vast
number
of
questions
should
be
to
accustom
the
pupil
to
use
his
knowledge
but
some
teachers
young
teachers
especially
are
always
and
seem
to
themselves
to
fail
when
their
questions
are
answered
without
difficulty
the
ear
the
voice
the
hand
should
all
be
practised
on
each
lesson
when
the
construing
is
known
transcription
of
the
german
is
not
by
any
means
to
be
despised
a
good
variety
of
transcription
is
for
the
teacher
to
write
the
german
clause
by
clause
on
the
and
rub
out
each
clause
before
the
pupils
begin
to
write
it
then
a
known
piece
may
be
prepared
for
dictation
in
reading
this
as
dictation
the
master
may
introduce
small
variations
to
teach
his
pupils
to
keep
their
ears
open
he
may
as
another
exercise
read
the
german
aloud
and
stop
here
and
there
for
the
boys
to
give
the
english
of
the
last
sentence
read
or
he
may
read
to
them
either
the
exact
german
in
the
book
or
small
variations
on
it
and
make
the
pupils
translate
clause
by
clause
he
may
then
ask
questions
on
the
piece
in
german
and
require
answers
in
english
for
exercises
there
are
many
devices
by
which
the
pupil
may
be
trained
to
observation
and
also
be
confirmed
in
his
knowledge
of
back
lessons
the
great
teacher
wolf
used
to
make
his
own
children
ascertain
how
many
times
such
and
such
a
word
occurred
in
such
and
such
pages
as
bréal
says
children
are
collectors
by
nature
and
acting
on
this
hint
we
might
say
in
column
all
the
dative
cases
on
pages
to
and
give
the
english
and
the
corresponding
or
from
those
pages
all
the
accusative
prepositions
with
the
accusatives
after
or
out
the
past
participles
with
their
or
such
and
such
sentences
and
explain
them
with
reference
to
the
or
questions
may
be
asked
on
the
of
the
book
there
is
no
end
to
the
possible
varieties
of
such
exercises
as
soon
as
they
get
any
feeling
of
the
language
the
pupils
should
learn
by
heart
some
easy
poetry
in
it
i
should
recommend
their
learning
the
english
of
the
piece
first
and
then
getting
the
german
from
the
teacher
to
quicken
the
german
in
their
minds
i
think
it
is
well
to
give
them
in
addition
a
german
prose
version
using
almost
the
same
words
variations
of
the
more
important
sentences
should
be
learnt
at
the
same
time
in
all
these
suggestions
you
will
see
what
i
am
aiming
at
i
wish
the
learner
to
get
a
feeling
of
and
a
power
over
the
main
words
of
the
language
and
the
machinery
in
which
they
are
employed
i
append
in
a
note
a
passage
from
the
old
edition
of
this
book
referring
to
the
cambridge
man
of
forty
years
ago
typical
cambridge
man
studies
mathematics
not
because
he
likes
mathematics
or
derives
any
pleasure
from
the
perception
of
mathematical
truth
still
less
with
the
notion
of
ever
using
his
knowledge
but
either
because
if
he
is
good
man
he
hopes
for
a
fellowship
or
because
if
he
can
not
aspire
so
high
he
considers
reading
the
thing
to
do
and
finds
a
satisfaction
in
mental
effort
just
as
he
does
in
a
constitutional
to
the
gogmagogs
when
such
a
student
takes
his
degree
he
is
by
no
means
a
highly
cultivated
man
but
he
is
not
the
sort
of
man
we
can
despise
for
all
that
he
has
in
him
to
use
one
of
his
own
metaphors
a
considerable
amount
of
which
may
be
applied
in
any
direction
he
has
great
power
of
concentration
and
sustained
mental
effort
even
on
subjects
which
are
distasteful
to
him
in
other
words
his
mind
is
under
the
control
of
his
will
and
he
can
bring
it
to
bear
promptly
and
vigorously
on
anything
put
before
him
he
will
sometimes
be
half
through
a
piece
of
work
while
an
average
oxonian
as
we
cambridge
men
conceive
of
him
at
least
is
thinking
about
beginning
but
his
training
has
taught
him
to
value
mental
force
without
teaching
him
to
care
about
its
application
perhaps
he
has
been
working
at
the
gymnasium
and
has
at
length
succeeded
in
a
hundredweight
in
learning
to
do
this
he
has
been
acquiring
strength
for
its
own
sake
he
does
not
want
to
put
up
hundredweights
but
simply
to
be
able
to
put
them
up
and
his
reward
is
the
consciousness
of
power
now
the
tripos
is
a
kind
of
competitive
examination
in
putting
up
weights
the
student
who
has
been
training
for
it
has
acquired
considerable
mental
vigour
and
when
he
has
put
up
his
weight
he
falls
back
on
the
consciousness
of
strength
which
he
seldom
thinks
of
using
having
put
up
the
heavier
he
despises
the
lighter
weights
he
rather
prides
himself
on
his
ignorance
of
such
things
as
history
modern
languages
and
english
literature
he
get
those
up
in
a
few
evenings
whenever
he
wants
them
he
reminds
me
indeed
of
a
tradesman
who
has
worked
hard
to
have
a
large
balance
at
his
this
done
he
is
satisfied
he
has
neither
taste
nor
desire
for
the
things
which
make
wealth
valuable
but
when
he
sees
other
people
in
the
enjoyment
of
them
he
hugs
himself
with
the
consciousness
that
he
can
write
a
cheque
for
such
things
whenever
he
on
this
interesting
subject
i
will
quote
three
men
who
said
nothing
morgan
helps
and
the
first
sir
james
stephen
de
morgan
speaking
of
plan
wrote
is
much
truth
in
the
assertion
that
new
knowledge
hooks
on
easily
to
a
little
of
the
old
thoroughly
mastered
the
day
is
coming
when
it
will
be
found
out
that
crammed
erudition
got
up
for
examination
does
not
cast
out
any
hooks
for
of
p
elsewhere
he
says
the
student
has
occupied
his
time
in
learning
a
moderate
portion
of
many
different
things
what
has
he
knowledge
or
useful
habits
even
if
he
can
be
said
to
have
varied
learning
it
will
not
long
be
true
of
him
for
nothing
flies
so
quickly
as
knowledge
and
when
this
is
gone
there
remains
but
a
slender
portion
of
useful
power
a
small
quantity
of
learning
quickly
evaporates
from
a
mind
which
never
held
any
learning
except
in
small
quantities
and
the
intellectual
philosopher
can
perhaps
explain
the
following
men
who
have
given
deep
attention
to
one
or
more
liberal
studies
can
learn
to
the
end
of
their
lives
and
are
able
to
retain
and
apply
very
small
quantities
of
other
kinds
of
knowledge
while
those
who
have
never
learnt
much
of
any
one
thing
seldom
acquire
new
knowledge
after
they
attain
to
years
of
maturity
and
frequently
lose
the
greater
part
of
that
which
they
once
sir
arthur
helps
in
in
says
things
are
so
connected
together
that
a
man
who
knows
one
subject
well
can
not
if
he
would
have
failed
to
have
acquired
much
besides
and
that
man
will
not
be
likely
to
keep
fewer
pearls
who
has
a
string
to
put
them
on
than
he
who
picks
them
up
and
throws
them
together
without
method
this
however
is
a
very
poor
metaphor
to
represent
the
matter
for
what
i
would
aim
at
producing
not
merely
holds
together
what
is
gained
but
has
vitality
in
always
growing
and
anybody
will
confirm
this
who
in
his
own
case
has
had
any
branch
of
study
or
human
affairs
to
work
upon
for
he
must
have
observed
how
all
he
meets
seems
to
work
in
with
and
assimilate
itself
to
his
own
peculiar
subject
during
his
lonely
walks
or
in
society
or
in
action
it
seems
as
if
this
one
pursuit
were
something
almost
independent
of
himself
always
on
the
watch
and
claiming
its
share
in
whatever
is
going
in
his
lecture
on
and
systematic
sir
james
stephen
said
is
a
world
not
a
chaos
the
various
accumulations
of
human
knowledge
are
not
so
many
detached
masses
they
are
all
connected
parts
of
one
great
system
of
truth
and
though
that
system
be
infinitely
too
comprehensive
for
any
one
of
us
to
compass
yet
each
component
member
of
it
bears
to
every
other
component
member
relations
which
each
of
us
may
in
his
own
department
of
study
search
out
and
discover
for
himself
a
man
is
really
and
soundly
learned
in
exact
proportion
to
the
number
and
to
the
importance
of
those
relations
which
he
has
thus
carefully
examined
and
accurately
this
essay
which
was
written
nearly
years
ago
i
leave
as
it
stands
i
take
some
credit
to
myself
for
having
early
recognised
the
importance
of
a
book
now
famous
june
this
proposition
has
been
ably
discussed
by
president
payne
to
the
science
of
brewer
as
spencer
himself
tells
us
his
business
is
very
extensive
finds
it
pay
to
keep
a
chemist
on
the
a
good
deal
better
i
suspect
than
learning
chemistry
at
school
helps
who
by
taste
and
talent
is
eminently
literary
put
in
this
claim
for
science
more
than
now
nearer
years
ago
higher
branches
of
method
can
not
be
taught
at
first
but
you
may
begin
by
teaching
orderliness
of
mind
collecting
classifying
contrasting
and
weighing
facts
are
some
of
the
processes
by
which
method
is
taught
scientific
method
may
be
acquired
without
many
sciences
being
learnt
but
one
or
two
great
branches
of
science
must
be
accurately
in
council
helps
though
by
his
delightful
style
he
never
gives
the
reader
any
notion
of
over
compression
has
told
us
more
truth
about
education
in
a
few
pages
than
one
sometimes
meets
with
in
a
complete
treatise
mill
who
by
the
way
would
leave
history
entirely
to
private
reading
at
has
pointed
out
that
is
not
a
fact
in
history
which
is
not
susceptible
of
as
many
different
explanations
as
there
are
possible
theories
of
human
affairs
and
that
is
not
the
foundation
but
the
verification
of
the
social
but
he
admits
that
we
know
of
former
ages
like
what
we
know
of
foreign
nations
is
with
all
its
imperfectness
of
much
use
by
correcting
the
narrowness
incident
to
personal
dissertations
vol
i
p
it
is
difficult
to
treat
seriously
the
arguments
by
which
spencer
endeavours
to
show
that
a
knowledge
of
science
is
necessary
for
the
practice
or
the
enjoyment
of
the
fine
arts
of
course
the
highest
art
of
every
kind
is
based
on
science
that
is
on
truths
which
science
takes
cognizance
of
and
explains
but
it
does
not
therefore
follow
that
science
there
can
be
neither
perfect
production
nor
full
spencer
tells
us
of
mistakes
which
john
lewis
and
rossetti
have
made
for
want
of
science
very
likely
and
had
those
gentlemen
devoted
much
of
their
time
to
science
we
should
never
have
heard
of
their
of
their
pictures
either
if
they
were
to
paint
a
piece
of
woodwork
a
carpenter
might
perhaps
detect
something
amiss
in
the
mitring
if
they
painted
a
wall
a
bricklayer
might
point
out
that
with
their
arrangement
of
stretchers
and
headers
the
wall
would
tumble
down
for
want
of
a
proper
bond
but
even
spencer
would
not
wish
them
to
spend
their
time
in
mastering
the
technicalities
of
every
handicraft
in
order
to
avoid
these
inaccuracies
it
is
the
business
of
the
painter
to
give
us
form
and
colour
as
they
reveal
themselves
to
the
eye
not
to
prepare
illustrations
of
scientific
the
physical
sciences
however
are
only
part
of
the
necessary
equipment
according
to
spencer
must
also
understand
how
the
minds
of
spectators
will
be
affected
by
the
several
peculiarities
of
his
question
in
psychology
still
more
surprising
is
dictum
about
poetry
rhythm
its
strong
and
numerous
metaphors
its
hyperboles
its
violent
inversions
are
simply
exaggerations
of
the
traits
of
excited
speech
to
be
good
therefore
poetry
must
pay
attention
to
those
laws
of
nervous
action
which
excited
speech
it
is
difficult
to
see
how
poetry
can
pay
attention
to
anything
the
poet
of
course
must
not
violate
those
laws
but
if
he
paid
to
them
in
composing
he
will
do
well
to
present
his
to
the
local
newspaper
it
seems
the
class
is
not
extinct
of
whom
pope
wrote
drily
plain
without
aid
dull
receipts
how
poems
may
be
on
speaking
of
law
medicine
engineering
and
the
industrial
arts
mill
remarks
those
whose
speciality
they
are
will
learn
them
as
a
branch
of
intelligence
or
as
a
mere
trade
and
whether
having
learnt
them
they
will
make
a
wise
and
conscientious
use
of
them
or
the
reverse
depends
less
on
the
manner
in
which
they
are
taught
their
profession
than
upon
sort
of
mind
they
bring
to
kind
of
intelligence
and
of
conscience
the
general
system
of

this
is

admirable

through

after
remarking
on
the
wrong
order
in
which
subjects
are
taught
he
continues
with
perceptions
unnaturally
dulled
by
early
thwartings
and
a
coerced
attention
to
books
what
with
the
mental
confusion
produced
by
teaching
subjects
before
they
can
be
understood
and
in
each
of
them
giving
generalisations
before
the
facts
of
which
they
are
the
generalisations

with
making
the
pupil
a
mere
passive
recipient
of
ideas
and
not
in
the
least
leading
him
to
be
an
active
inquirer
or
and
what
with
taxing
the
faculties
to
excess
there
are
very
few
minds
that
become
as
efficient
as
they
might
a
class
of
boys
whom
i
once
took
in
latin
delectus
denied
with
the
utmost
confidence
when
i
questioned
them
on
the
subject
that
there
were
any
such
things
in
english
as
verbs
and
substantives
on
another
occasion
i
saw
a
poor
boy
of
nine
or
ten
caned
because
when
he
had
said
that
was
a
deponent
verb
he
could
not
say
what
a
deponent
verb
was
even
if
he
had
remembered
the
inaccurate
grammar
definition
expected
of
him
deponent
verb
is
a
verb
with
a
passive
form
and
an
active
meaning
his
comprehension
of
would
have
been
no
greater
it
is
worth
observing
that
even
when
offending
grievously
in
great
matters
against
the
principle
of
connecting
fresh
knowledge
with
the
old
teachers
are
sometimes
driven
to
it
in
small
they
find
that
it
is
better
for
boys
to
see
that
is
like
and
like
than
simply
to
learn
that
is
of
the
second
declension
and
of
the
first
conjugation
if
boys
had
to
learn
by
a
mere
effort
of
memory
the
particular
declension
or
conjugation
of
latin
words
before
they
were
taught
anything
about
declensions
and
conjugations
this
would
be
as
sensible
as
the
method
adopted
in
some
other
instances
and
the
teachers
might
urge
as
usual
that
the
information
would
come
in
useful
afterwards
spencer
and
professor
tyndall
appeal
to
the
results
of
experience
as
justifying
a
more
rational
method
of
teaching
speaking
of
geometrical
deductions
spencer
says
has
repeatedly
occurred
that
those
who
have
been
stupefied
by
the
ordinary
its
abstract
formulas
its
wearisome
tasks
its
suddenly
had
their
intellects
roused
by
thus
ceasing
to
make
them
passive
recipients
and
inducing
them
to
become
active
discoverers
the
discouragement
caused
by
bad
teaching
having
been
diminished
by
a
little
sympathy
and
sufficient
perseverance
excited
to
achieve
a
first
success
there
arises
a
revolution
of
feeling
affecting
the
whole
nature
they
no
longer
find
themselves
incompetent
they
too
can
do
something
and
gradually
as
success
follows
success
the
incubus
of
despair
disappears
and
they
attack
the
difficulties
of
their
other
studies
with
a
courage
insuring
on
this
subject
i
can
quote
the
authority
of
a
great
observer
of
the
less
a
man
indeed
than
wordsworth
he
speaks
of
the
elementary
principal
of
pleasure
by
which
man
knows
and
feels
and
lives
and
moves
we
have
no
sympathy
he
continues
what
is
propagated
by
would
not
be
wherever
we
sympathise
with
pain
it
will
be
found
that
the
sympathy
is
produced
and
carried
on
by
subtile
combinations
with
pleasure
we
have
no
knowledge
that
is
no
general
principles
drawn
from
the
contemplation
of
particular
facts
but
what
has
been
built
up
by
pleasure
and
exists
in
us
by
pleasure
alone
the
man
of
science
the
chemist
and
mathematician
whatever
difficulties
and
disgusts
they
may
have
to
struggle
with
know
and
feel
this
however
painful
may
be
the
objects
with
which
the
knowledge
may
be
connected
he
feels
that
his
knowledge
is
pleasure
and
he
has
no
pleasure
he
has
no

wordsworth
would
have
agreed
with

what
you
most
this
remark
i
am
glad
to
say
is
much
less
true
now
than
when
first
published
indeed
some
purveyors
of
books
for
children
are
getting
to
rely
too
exclusively
on
the
pictures
just
as
i
have
noticed
that
an
with
a
monkey
seldom
or
never
has
a
good
organ
of
large
pictures
for
class
teaching
some
of
the
best

have
seen

for

and

briggate

very
useful
for

for
higher
stages
one
might
say
the
same
of
with
vertical
wires
the
grammar
question
is
still
a
perplexing
one
there
are
inspectors
who
require
children
as
i
once
heard
in
a
remote
country
school
to
distinguish
kinds
of
then
we
have
children
discriminating
after
the
fashion
of
one
of
my
own
pupils
i
quote
from
a
grammar
paper
is
a
prepreition
almost
all
small
words
are
in
such
cases
it
is
very
hard
indeed
to
find
any
common
ground
for
the
minds
of
the
old
and
the
young
the
true
way
i
believe
is
to
lead
the
young
to
make
their
own
observations
the
way
is
very
very
slow
but
it
developes
power
i
have
lately
seen
an
interesting
little
book
on
these
lines
called
by
de
garmo
bloomington
books
for
a
beginner
should
contain
a
little
matter
in
much
space
and
as
they
are
usually
written
they
contain
much
matter
in
a
little
space
nothing
can
be
truer
than
the
saying
of
lakanal

le
contraire

that
which
is
abridged
is
just
the
opposite
of
that
which
is

a
silly
poor
kind
of

not
unlike
to
the

of
those
poor

neither

not

about

my

is
keep
clear
of

yet

of

which
i
suggested
in
irony
i
afterwards
found
proposed
in
all
seriousness
in
an
announcement
of
marginal
analysis
has
been
collected
at
the
beginning
of

so
as
to
form
an
abstract
of

for
the
use
of
those
who
are
beginning
the

would
rather
listen
to

such
stories
alone
should
be
laid
before

as
might
catch
the
imagination
instead
of
this
they
are
too
frequently
obliged
to
toil
through
the
four
empires
as
they
are
called
where
their
memories
are
burthened
by
a
number
of
disgusting
names
that
destroy
all

that

in
it
had
to
point
out
that
it
had
appeared
before

modern

on

has
come
to
the

conclusion
as

not

devil
is
an
act
sc
i
fortify
myself
with
the
following
quotation
from
the
about
by
hope
moncrieff
he
says
that
a
school
of
from
twenty
to
a
hundred
boys
is
too
large
to
be
altogether
under
the
influence
of
one
man
and
too
small
for
the
development
of
a
healthy
condition
of
public
opinion
among
the
boys
themselves
a
community
of
fifty
boys
there
will
always
be
found
so
many
bad
ones
who
will
be
likely
to
carry
things
their
own
way
vice
is
more
unblushing
in
small
societies
than
in
large
ones
boys
will
be
more
easily
leavened
by
the
wickedness
of
five
than
five
hundred
by
that
of
it
would
be
too
dangerous
an
ordeal
to
send
a
boy
to
a
school
where
sin
appears
fashionable
and
where
if
he
would
remain
virtuous
he
must
shun
his
companions
there
may
be
schools
which
derive
a
good
and
healthy
tone
from
the
moral
strength
of
their
masters
or
the
good
example
of
a
certain
set
of
boys
but
i
doubt
if
there
are
many
boys
are
so
easily
led
to
do
right
or
wrong
that
we
should
be
very
careful
at
least
to
set
the
balance
and
again
he
says
moral
tone
of
a
school
will
be
peculiarly
liable
to
be
at
the
mercy
of
a
set
of
bold
and
bad
as
i
have
been
thought
to
express
myself
too
strongly
on
this
point
i
will
give
a
quotation
from
a
master
whose
opinion
will
go
far
with
all
who
know
him
moral
tone
of
the
school
is
made
what
it
is
not
nearly
so
much
by
its
rules
and
regulations
or
its
masters
as
by
the
leading
characters
among
the
boys
they
mainly
determine
the
public
opinion
amongst
their
personal
influence
is
rev
edwardes
of
denstone
about
preparatory
schools
i
find
i
am
at
issue
with
my
friend
the
head
master
of
harrow
see
by
rev
welldon
in
may
i
do
indeed
incline
to
his
opinion
that
very
young
boys
should
not
be
at
a
public
school
but
i
can
not
agree
that
they
should
be
at
a
boarding
school
i
hold
that
they
should
live
in
a
their
own
if
possible
and
go
to
a
day
school
day
schools
have
now
been
provided
for
girls
but
for
young
boys
they
do
not
seem
in
demand
english
parents
who
can
afford
it
send
their
sons
to
boarding
schools
from
eight
years
old
onwards
this
seems
to
me
a
great
mistake
of
theirs
is
education
it
is
that
which
is
imbibed
from
the
moral
atmosphere
which
a
child
breathes
it
is
the
involuntary
and
unconscious
language
of
its
parents
and
of
all
those
by
whom
it
is
surrounded
and
not
their
set
speeches
and
set
lectures
it
is
the
words
which
the
young
hear
fall
from
their
seniors
when
the
speakers
are
off
their
guard
and
it
is
by
these
unconscious
expressions
that
the
child
interprets
the
hearts
of
its
parents
that
is
in
in
what
i
have
said
on
this
subject
the
incompleteness
which
is
noticeable
enough
in
the
preceding
essays
has
found
an
appropriate
climax
i
see
too
that
if
anyone
would
take
the
trouble
the
little
i
have
said
might
easily
be
misinterpreted
i
am
well
aware
however
that
if
the
young
mind
will
not
readily
assimilate
sharply
defining
religious
formulæ
still
less
will
it
feel
at
home
among
the
and
the
great
educating
force
of
christianity
i
believe
to
be
due
to
this
that
it
is
not
a
set
of
abstractions
or
vague
generalities
but
that
in
it
god
reveals
himself
to
us
in
a
divine
man
and
raises
us
through
our
devotion
to
him
i
hold
therefore
that
religious
teaching
for
the
young
should
neither
be
vague
nor
abstract
froude
in
commenting
on
the
use
made
of
hagiology
in
the
church
of
rome
has
shown
that
we
lose
much
by
not
following
the
bible
method
of
instruction
see
studies
lives
of
the
and
this
theory
of
the
task
which
makes
him
a
disposer
or
director
of
influence
rather
than
a
teacher
led
locke
to
decry
our
public
schools
for
in
them
the
traditions
and
tone
of
the
school
seem
the
source
of
influence
and
the
masters
are
to
all
appearance
mainly
teachers
own
words
are
these
difference
is
great
between
two
or
three
pupils
in
the
same
house
and
three
or
four
score
boys
lodged
up
and
down
for
let
the
industry
and
skill
be
never
so
great
it
is
impossible
he
should
have
fifty
or
a
hundred
scholars
under
his
eye
any
longer
than
they
are
in
the
school
together
nor
can
it
be
expected
that
he
should
instruct
them
successfully
in
anything
but
their
books
the
forming
of
their
minds
and
manners
requiring
a
constant
attention
and
particular
application
to
every
single
boy
which
is
impossible
in
a
numerous
flock
and
would
be
wholly
in
vain
could
he
have
time
to
study
and
correct
particular
defects
and
wrong
inclinations
when
the
lad
was
to
be
left
to
himself
or
the
prevailing
infection
of
his
fellows
the
greatest
part
of
the
but
the
educator
who
considers
himself
a
director
of
influences
must
remember
that
he
is
not
the
only
force
the
companions
are
a
force
at
least
as
great
and
if
he
were
brought
up
in
private
on
system
he
would
be
entirely
without
a
kind
of
influence
much
more
valuable
than
locke
seems
to
influence
of
boy
companions
and
of
the
traditions
of
a
great
school
on
the
other
hand
it
can
not
be
denied
that
our
public
schools
used
to
be
and
perhaps
are
still
to
some
extent
and
that
the
masters
should
not
be
the
mere
teachers
which
from
overwork
and
other
causes
they
often
tend
to
become
the
consequence
has
been
that
the
real
education
of
the
boys
has
in
a
great
measure
passed
out
of
their
hands
what
has
been
the
result
a
long
succession
of
able
teachers
have
aimed
at
giving
literary
instruction
and
making
their
pupils
classical
scholars
both
manners
and
bodily
training
have
been
left
to
take
care
of
themselves
yet
such
is
the
irony
of
fate
that
the
majority
of
youths
who
leave
our
great
schools
are
not
literary
and
are
not
much
of
classical
scholars
but
they
are
decidedly
gentlemanly
and
still
more
decidedly
athletic
i
append
a
note
written
from
a
different
point
of
how
little
wisdom
certainly
seems
to
cover
most
departments
of
life
yes
but
are
we
not
apt
to
overlook
the
wisdom
that
lies
in
the
great
mass
of
people
in
some
small
department
we
may
have
investigated
further
than
our
and
may
see
or
think
we
see
a
good
deal
of
stupidity
in
what
goes
on
but
in
most
matters
we
do
not
investigate
for
ourselves
but
just
do
the
usual
thing
and
this
seems
to
work
all
right
there
must
be
a
good
deal
of
wisdom
underlying
the
complex
machinery
of
civilised
life
fools
will
by
no
means
account
for
it
at
times
one
has
a
dim
perception
that
people
in
general
are
not
so
stupid
as
they
seem
perhaps
a
long
life
would
in
the
end
lead
us
to
say
like
tithonus
should
a
man
desire
in
any
way
vary
from
the
kindly
race
of
men
there
is
a
higher
wisdom
than
the
disintegrating
individualism
of
carlyle
far
better
to
believe
with
mazzini
in
collective
existence
of
humanity
and
remembering
that
we
work
in
a
medium
fashioned
for
us
by
the
labours
of
all
who
have
preceded
us
regard
our
collective
powers
as
upon
those
of
all
foregoing
this
is
the
point
of
view
to
which
wordsworth
would
raise
us
the
multitudes
that
huge
city
oftentimes
was
seen
unity
of
man
spirit
over
ignorance
and
vice
in
good
and
evil
hearts
sense
for
moral
judgements
as
one
eye
the
light
the
soul
when
smitten
thus
a
sublime
whence
for
union
or
communion
feeds
the
pure
bliss
and
takes
her
rest
with
viij
though
unable
to
share
in
pure
of
wordsworth
we
may
take
refuge
with
goethe
in
the
thought
that
is
the
true
man
and
enjoy
much
to
which
we
have
no
claim
as
individuals
tradition
blind
tradition
must
rule
our
actions
through
by
far
the
greatest
part
of
our
lives
and
seeing
we
owe
it
so
much
we
should
be
tolerant
even
grateful
professor
jebb
has
lately
given
us
the
main
ideas
of
the
great
scholar
erasmus
all
his
work
says
the
professor
had
an
educational
aim
the
evils
of
his
age
in
church
in
state
in
the
daily
lives
of
men
seemed
to
him
to
have
their
roots
in
ignorance
of
what
christianity
meant
ignorance
of
what
the
bible
taught
ignorance
of
what
the
noblest
and
most
gifted
minds
of
the
past
whether
christian
or
pagan
had
contributed
to
the
instruction
of
the
human
rede
lecture
erasmus
evidently
fell
into
the
error
against
which
pestalozzi
and
froebel
lift
up
their
voices
often
in
error
of
forgetting
that
knowledge
is
of
no
avail
without
intelligence
what
is
the
use
of
lighting
additional
candles
for
the
blind
appendix
of
this
wise
man
has
advised
us
never
to
find
fault
with
ourselves
for
says
he
you
may
always
depend
on
your
friends
to
do
it
for
you
so
having
looked
through
the
proofs
of
this
book
i
abstain
from
i
fancy
i
find
fault
more
effectively
than
my
friends
or
even
my
professional
critics
as
the
in
an
easy
says
very
truly
the
author
has
read
his
book
many
times
the
critic
has
read
it
once
in
fact
the
critic
gives
to
the
book
in
some
cases
to
the
subject
of
the
book
also
no
greater
number
of
hours
than
the
author
has
given
months
perhaps
years
partiality
blinds
the
author
no
doubt
but
unless
he
is
a
fatuous
person
it
does
not
blind
him
so
much
as
his
haste
blinds
the
critic
an
author
of
note
said
of
a
book
of
his
which
had
been
much
criticised
book
has
faults
but
i
am
the
only
person
who
has
discovered
them
to
which
a
friend
maliciously
appended
read
whatever
was
the
truth
here
i
am
inclined
to
think
the
author
has
the
best
chance
of
putting
his
finger
on
the
weak
places
but
if
i
see
weaknesses
in
the
foregoing
book
why
do
i
not
make
it
better
just
for
two
reasons
to
improve
the
book
i
should
have
to
spend
more
time
on
it
and
more
money
the
more
i
read
and
think
about
any
one
of
my
subjects
the
more
i
want
to
go
on
reading
and
thinking
perhaps
i
hear
of
an
old
book
that
has
escaped
my
notice
or
a
new
book
comes
out
sometimes
an
important
book
like
so
i
can
never
finish
an
essay
to
my
satisfaction
and
the
only
way
of
getting
it
off
my
hands
is
to
send
the
copy
to
the
printer
by
the
time
the
proof
comes
in
there
is
something
that
i
should
like
to
add
or
alter
but
then
the
dread
of
a
long
bill
for
restrains
me
however
now
the
book
is
all
in
type
i
see
here
and
there
something
that
suggests
a
note
by
way
of
explanation
or
addition
so
i
add
this
appendix
taking
a
hint
from
one
of
my
favourite
authors
sir
arthur
helps
i
throw
my
notes
into
the
form
of
a
dialogue
but
being
entirely
destitute
of
dramatic
skill
i
confine
myself
to
the
essayist
and
amicus
who
is
only
too
clearly
an
so
the
americans
have
kept
alive
your
old
book
for
you
and
at
last
you
have
rewritten
it
you
at
least
have
no
reason
to
complain
that
there
is
no
international
copyright
your
book
would
have
been
forgotten
long
ago
if
a
lady
in
cincinnati
had
not
persuaded
an
american
publisher
there
to
reprint
it
yes
i
very
readily
allow
that
i
have
been
a
gainer
the
americans
have
done
more
for
me
than
my
own
countrymen
to
be
sure
neither
have
with
the
as
has
it
and
in
money
at
least
the
book
has
never
paid
its
expenses
but
three
american
publishers
have
done
for
themselves
what
no
englishman
would
do
for
me
publish
at
their
own
risk
in
when
my
was
ready
i
went
to
my
old
friend
alexander
macmillan
but
he
would
not
even
look
at
it
on
education
said
he
pay
why
there
is
and
a
capital
i
assented
heartily
for
i
was
very
fond
of
it
i
was
forced
to
admit
that
in
that
case
i
had
little
chance
i
said
suppose
you
would
publish
at
my
risk
said
macmillan
author
is
never
satisfied
when
his
book
would
you
advise
i
asked
give
you
a
letter
of
introduction
to
william
longman
said
macmillan
dare
say
publish
for
with
this
letter
i
went
to
william
longman
who
has
since
those
days
been
gathered
to
his
ancestors
formerly
of
paternoster
row
longman
said
he
would
put
the
in
the
hands
of
his
reader
if
the
report
was
favourable
the
firm
would
offer
me
terms
if
not
they
would
publish
for
me
on
commission
i
sent
the
accordingly
and
soon
after
i
had
a
letter
from
the
firm
offering
to
publish
when
the
book
was
in
type
longman
advised
me
to
have
only
printed
and
to
publish
at
a
high
price
should
charge
he
said
few
people
will
buy
and
they
consider
the
this
was
not
my
opinion
but
in
such
a
matter
i
felt
that
the
weight
of
authority
was
enormously
against
me
so
i
consented
to
the
publishing
price
of
and
at
first
it
seemed
that
longman
was
least
about
the
small
number
of
purchasers
was
spent
in
advertising
and
the
book
was
very
generally
and
i
may
say
very
favourably
reviewed
but
when
about
copies
had
been
sold
it
almost
entirely
ceased
i
think
copies
were
sold
in
six
months
so
to
get
rid
of
the
remainder
of
my
copies
some
of
them
i
put
down
the
price
to
then
it
seemed
that
longman
had
made
a
mistake
about
the
price
without
another
advertisement
the
were
sold
in
a
month
or
two
some
time
after
i
heard
that
the
book
had
been
republished
in
cincinnati
and
on
my
writing
to
the
publishers
robert
clarke
they
presented
me
with
copies
this
proved
to
be
a
perfect
reprint
which
is
more
than
i
can
say
of
those
which
years
afterwards
were
issued
by
bardeen
and
kellogg
i
have
therefore
from
time
to
time
purchased
from
clarke
and
imported
the
copies
i
suppose
about
in
all
that
have
been
wanted
for
the
english
market
i
hope
these
details
do
not
bore
you
not
at
all
the
history
of
any
book
interests
me
and
your
book
has
had
some
odd
experiences
it
has
lived
i
own
much
longer
than
i
expected
and
for
this
you
have
to
thank
the
americans
in
my
case
the
absence
of
international
copyright
has
done
no
harm
certainly
but
after
all
copyright
has
its
advantages
international
copyright
included
specialists
suffer
severely
from
the
want
of
it
perhaps
the
public
in
this
country
is
so
small
that
an
important
book
for
it
can
not
be
published
if
to
our
special
public
were
joined
the
special
public
of
the
the
book
might
be
fairly
remunerative
to
its
author
take
joseph
writings
these
would
have
been
lost
to
the
world
had
not
payne
published
them
as
an
act
of
filial
piety
with
an
international
copyright
these
works
would
be
very
good
property
you
think
then
that
in
the
long
run
is
the
best
even
internationally
i
must
say
my
opinion
does
incline
in
that
direction
matches
p
i
think
you
have
had
a
good
deal
to
do
with
class
matches
yes
one
must
be
careful
not
to
overdo
them
but
i
have
found
an
occasional
match
a
capital
way
of
enlivening
some
time
before
the
match
takes
place
the
master
lets
the
two
best
boys
pick
up
sides
the
second
boy
having
the
first
choice
the
subject
for
the
match
is
then
arranged
and
to
prevent
disputes
the
area
must
be
carefully
defined
moreover
there
must
be
no
opportunity
for
the
boys
to
ask
questions
about
unimportant
details
that
are
likely
to
have
escaped
attention
when
the
match
is
to
take
place
each
boy
should
come
provided
with
a
set
of
written
questions
and
whenever
a
boy
shows
himself
ignorant
of
the
right
answer
to
a
question
of
his
own
he
must
be
held
to
have
failed
even
if
his
opponent
is
ignorant
also
at
harrow
where
i
had
a
as
it
is
there
called
to
myself
i
used
to
work
these
matches
very
successfully
in
german
say
lorelei
had
been
learnt
by
heart
i
set
as
a
subject
for
a
match
the
plurals
of
the
substantives
and
the
past
participles
of
the
verbs
in
the
poem
or
the
boys
had
to
make
up
for
themselves
and
number
on
paper
a
set
of
short
sentences
in
which
only
words
which
occurred
in
the
poem
were
used
in
this
last
case
the
questioner
handed
in
to
the
master
his
paper
with
both
the
english
and
the
german
on
it
and
the
master
gave
the
other
side
the
english
of
which
they
had
to
write
the
german
the
details
of
such
matches
may
of
course
be
varied
to
any
extent
so
long
as
the
subject
set
is
quite
definite
the
scoring
will
be
found
best
at
the
lower
end
so
that
a
match
stimulates
those
who
need
stimulus
what
did
you
call
pairs
oh
that
was
a
device
for
getting
up
a
little
harmless
excitement
knowing
the
capacities
of
my
boys
i
arranged
them
in
pairs
the
best
boy
and
the
worst
forming
one
pair
the
next
best
and
next
worst
the
second
pair
i
then
asked
a
series
of
questions
to
which
all
had
to
write
short
answers
i
then
looked
over
the
answers
and
marked
them
finally
the
marks
of
each
were
added
together
and
i
announced
the
order
in
which
the
pairs
it
was
really
for
neither
i
nor
anyone
could
predict
the
result
if
the
number
of
boys
was
an
odd
number
the
boy
in
the
middle
fought
for
his
own
hand
and
had
his
marks
doubled
perhaps
on
the
whole
he
had
the
best
chance
there
were
then
some
forms
of
emulation
which
you
did
not
set
your
face
against
there
were
many
but
i
preferred
emulation
which
stimulated
the
idle
rather
than
the
industrious
most
act
only
on
those
who
would
be
better
without
them
do
you
see
no
danger
in
encouraging
rivalry
between
different
bodies
the
strife
between
parties
has
often
been
more
virulent
than
the
strife
between
individuals
yes
i
know
well
that
in
exciting
one
is
playing
with
edged
tools
and
besides
this
a
boy
who
for
any
cause
is
thought
a
disgrace
to
his
side
is
very
likely
to
be
bullied
by
it
let
me
tell
you
of
one
form
of
stimulus
which
seemed
to
work
well
and
was
free
from
most
of
the
objections
you
are
thinking
of
when
i
had
a
small
school
of
my
own
in
which
there
were
only
young
boys
i
put
up
in
the
a
list
of
the
names
in
alphabetical
order
with
blank
spaces
after
the
names
i
looked
over
the
written
work
very
carefully
and
whenever
i
came
across
any
written
exercise
evidently
done
with
great
painstaking
and
for
that
boy
with
more
than
ordinary
success
i
marked
it
with
a
g
and
i
put
up
the
g
in
one
of
the
spaces
after
that
name
in
the
list
hung
up
in
the
when
the
school
collectively
had
obtained
a
fixed
number
of
we
had
an
extra
the
announcement
of
a
g
was
therefore
always
hailed
with
delight
i
see
one
thing
in
favour
of
that
device
you
might
by
a
g
give
encouragement
to
a
boy
when
he
has
just
begun
to
this
is
often
a
in
a
life
and
a
early
recognition
of
effort
may
do
much
to
strengthen
into
a
habit
what
might
without
the
recognition
have
proved
nothing
but
a
passing
whim
at
the
very
least
all
such
devices
have
one
good
effect
they
break
the
monotony
of
and
monotony
is
much
more
wearing
to
the
young
than
it
is
to
their
elders
can
you
tell
me
of
others
who
have
used
such
plans
a
friend
of
mine
who
has
a
genius
for
inventing
school
plans
of
all
kinds
and
marvellous
energy
in
working
them
has
a
in
connexion
with
a
large
school
the
marks
of
every
boy
in
the
school
are
given
out
for
each
week
my
friend
gives
a
supper
at
the
end
of
the
quarter
if
the
average
marks
of
his
house
come
up
to
a
certain
standard
he
puts
up
each
week
a
list
of
of
the
boys
who
have
surpassed
the
average
and
of
of
boys
who
have
fallen
below
it
no
doubt
this
is
an
effective
spur
but
i
should
fear
it
would
in
practice
deliver
the
hindermost
to
satan
the
boy
whom
nature
has
made
a
is
likely
to
have
by
no
means
a
good
time
in
that
house
do
you
know
if
such
devices
as
you
have
mentioned
are
common
in
schools
i
really
say
i
have
seen
in
american
school
papers
accounts
of
class
matches
in
the
new
england
of
november
winship
gave
an
account
of
some
matches
at
milwaukee
there
is
a
match
between
three
classes
say
in
penmanship
if
there
are
seventy
boys
in
the
three
classes
together
each
boy
draws
a
number
from
one
to
seventy
and
puts
not
his
name
but
his
number
on
his
paper
the
same
lesson
is
set
for
all
the
papers
are
collected
divided
into
three
equal
heaps
and
looked
over
and
marked
by
three
masters
finally
the
of
each
class
is
taken
in
mental
arithmetic
each
class
chooses
its
own
champions
this
would
be
fun
but
would
do
nothing
for
the
lower
end
of
the
class
the
principal
of
mcdonough
school
no
new
orleans
chambers
gives
an
account
in
the
new
york
december
how
he
organised
sixteen
boys
into
teams
of
four
putting
the
best
and
worst
together
as
i
did
in
making
up
scratch
pairs
the
match
between
these
teams
was
to
see
which
could
get
the
best
record
for
the
month
as
mr
chambers
tells
us
the
sharper
boys
managed
with
more
success
than
the
master
to
let
light
into
the
dull
intellects
of
boys
in
the
same
team
with
them
this
union
of
interests
between
the
and
the
as
the
french
call
them
is
a
very
good
feature
in
combats
of
what
is
it
that
interests
you
so
much
in
the
jesuits
two
things
first
the
jesuit
shows
the
effects
of
a
definitely
planned
and
rigidly
carried
out
system
of
education
and
next
in
such
a
society
you
find
a
continuity
of
effort
which
is
and
must
be
wanting
in
the
life
of
an
individual
if
ever
feel
that
we
are
greater
than
we
it
is
when
we
can
think
of
ourselves
as
parts
of
a
society
a
society
which
existed
long
before
us
and
will
last
after
us
for
instance
it
is
a
great
thing
to
be
connected
with
an
historical
school
such
as
harrow
we
then
realise
as
the
poet
bowen
has
said
that
we
are
no
mere
of
yesterday
and
thinking
of
the
connection
between
the
mighty
dead
and
the
old
school
we
join
heartily
in
the
chorus
of
the
school
song
glory
thus
shall
circle
us
time
be
i
verily
believe
you
expect
your
share
in
this
for
having
invented
the
harrow
book
which
is
likely
to
outlive
but
if
the
boys
ever
thought
of
the
inventor
which
they
they
would
naturally
suppose
that
he
was
some
contemporary
of
cadmus
or
deucalion
transit
but
what
has
this
to
do
with
the
jesuits
only
this
that
by
corporate
life
you
secure
a
continuity
of
effort
there
is
to
me
something
very
attractive
in
the
idea
of
a
teaching
society
how
such
a
society
might
capitalise
its
discoveries
the
roman
church
has
shown
a
genius
for
such
societies
witness
the
jesuits
and
the
christian
brothers
the
experience
of
centuries
must
have
taught
them
much
that
we
could
learn
of
them
the
jesuits
seem
to
me
to
be
without
the
spirit
of
investigators
and
discoverers
the
rules
of
their
society
do
not
permit
of
their
learning
anything
or
forgetting
anything
ignatius
loyola
was
a
wonderful
man
but
he
must
have
been
superhuman
if
he
could
legislate
for
all
time
by
the
way
i
see
you
say
the
first
edition
of
the
was
published
in
what
is
your
authority
i
took
the
date
from
the
copy
in
the
british
museum
according
to
a
volume
published
by
rivingtons
in
societatis
the
were
first
printed
in
but
were
not
divulged
till
celebrated
suit
of
the
mm
lionci
and
father
la
in
doctrinale
i
thought
you
made
it
a
rule
to
give
only
what
was
useful
what
can
be
the
use
of
the
quotations
which
your
old
appendix
contained
a
celebrated
grammar
written
by
a
franciscan
of
brittany
about
the
middle
of
the
perhaps
i
had
an
attack
of
antiquarianism
but
i
rather
think
the
quotations
were
given
in
order
to
shew
our
progress
since
those
days
the
art
of
making
easy
things
difficult
is
well
exemplified
in
rules
for
the
first
declension
but
life
is
short
and
folly
is
best
forgotten
grammar
would
not
your
last
remark
rule
out
what
you
told
us
about
grammar
as
regards
assertion
of
nouns
be
it
certainly
would
surely
nobody
but
a
writer
of
would
ever
have
thought
of
making
a
out
of
hæc
hoc
but
the
absurdity
did
not
originate
with
lily
he
was
all
for
simplification
and
though
there
were
some
changes
in
the
eton
latin
grammar
which
succeeded
the
introduction
of
known
as
grammar
these
changes
were
some
of
them
at
least
by
no
means
improvements
the
old
book
put
before
ablatives
and
taught
that
a
was
if
this
was
not
any
better
than
teaching
that
by
itself
was
a
lord
it
was
at
least
no
worse
the
optative
of
the
old
book
i
pray
god
i
be
would
god
i
were
and
the
subjunctive
when
i
am
were
better
than
the
oracular
statement
which
perplexed
my
youth
subjunctive
mood
is
declined
like
the
how
often
i
said
those
words
and
being
of
an
inquiring
mind
wondered

on

was
the

after
the
accidence
of
the
eight
parts
of
speech
he
says
these
eight
parts
of
speech
in
order
well
construed
be
made
reasons
and
sentences
and
long
orations
but
how
and
in
what
manner
and
with
what
constructions
of
words
and
all
the
varieties
and
diversities
and
changes
in
latin
speech
which
be
innumerable
if
any
man
will
know
and
by
that
knowledge
attain
to
understand
latin
books
and
to
speak
and
to
write
clean
latin
let
him
above
all
busily
learn
and
read
good
latin
authors
of
chosen
poets
and
orators
and
note
wisely
how
they
wrote
and
spake
and
study
always
to
follow
them
desiring
none
other
rules
but
their
examples
for
in
the
beginning
men
spake
not
latin
because
such
rules
were
made
but
contrariwise
because
men
spake
such
latin
upon
that
followed
the
rules
and
were
made
that
is
to
say
latin
speech
was
before
the
rules
and
not
the
rules
before
the
latin
speech
wherefore
masters
and
teachers
of
grammar
after
the
parts
of
speech
sufficiently
known
in
our
schools
read
and
expound
plainly
unto
your
scholars
good
authors
and
show
to
them
in
every
word
and
in
every
sentence
what
they
shall
note
and
observe
warning
them
busily
to
follow
and
do
like
both
in
writing
and
in
speaking
and
be
to
them
your
own
self
also
speaking
with
them
the
pure
latin
very
present
and
leave
the
rules
for
reading
of
good
books
diligent
information
of
learned
masters
studious
advertence
and
taking
heed
of
learners
hearing
eloquent
men
speak
and
finally
busy
imitation
with
tongue
and
pen
more
availeth
shortly
to
get
the
true
eloquent
speech
than
all
the
traditions
rules
and
precepts
of
this
passage
is
i
find
well
known
it
is
given
in
of
and
is
referred
to
by
seebohm
lupton
latest
biographer
has
kindly
corrected
the
date
for
me
it
is
indistinct
in
the
museum
copy
for
english
except
in
edition
your
extracts
from
have
been
omitted
by
your
american
reprinters
so
i
see
i
should
have
thought
the
americans
would
have
been
much
interested
by
this
early
praise
of
our
common
language
the
passage
is
certainly
a
very
remarkable
one
and
professor
masson
has
thought
it
worth
quoting
in
his
of
the
is
a
scarce
book
so
i
will
not
follow
my
reprinters
in
leaving
out
this
passage
it
not
a
marvellous
bondage
to
become
servants
to
one
tongue
for
sake
the
most
part
of
our
time
with
loss
of
most
time
whereas
we
may
have
the
very
same
treasure
in
our
own
tongue
with
the
gain
of
most
time
our
own
bearing
the
joyful
title
of
our
liberty
and
freedom
the
latin
tongue
remembering
us
of
our
thraldom
and
bondage
i
love
rome
but
london
better
i
favour
italy
but
england
more
i
honour
the
latin
but
i
worship
the
english
i
honour
foreign
tongues
but
wish
my
own
to
be
partaker
of
their
honour
knowing
them
i
wish
my
own
tongue
to
resemble
their
grace
i
confess
their
furniture
and
wish
it
were
ours
the
diligent
labour
of
learned
countrymen
did
so
enrich
those
tongues
and
not
the
tongues
themselves
though
they
proved
very
pliable
as
our
tongue
will
prove
i
dare
assure
it
of
knowledge
if
our
learned
countrymen
will
put
to
their
labour
and
why
not
i
pray
you
as
well
in
english
as
either
latin
or
any
tongue
else
will
ye
say
it
is
needless
sure
that
will
not
hold
if
loss
of
time
while
ye
be
pilgrims
to
learning
by
lingering
about
tongues
be
no
argument
of
need
if
lack
of
sound
skill
while
the
tongue
distracteth
sense
more
than
half
to
itself
and
that
most
of
all
in
a
simple
student
or
a
silly
wit
be
no
argument
of
need
then
ye
say
somewhat
which
pretend
no
need
but
because
we
needed
not
to
lose
any
time
unless
we
listed
if
we
had
such
a
vantage
in
the
course
of
study
as
we
now
lose
while
we
travail
in
tongues
and
because
our
understanding
also
were
most
full
in
our
natural
speech
though
we
know
the
foreign
exceedingly
itself
doth
call
for
whereby
all
that
gaiety
may
be
had
at
home
which
makes
us
gaze
so
much
at
the
fine
among
various
objections
to
the
use
of
english
which
he
answers
he
comes
to
this
one
will
ye
thus
break
off
the
common
conference
with
the
learned
foreign
to
this
his
answer
is
not
very
forcible
conference
will
not
cease
while
the
people
have
cause
to
interchange
dealings
and
without
the
latin
it
may
well
be
continued
as
in
some
countries
the
learneder
sort
and
some
near
cousins
to
the
latin
itself
do
already
wean
their
pens
and
tongues
from
the
use
of
the
latin
both
in
written
discourse
and
spoken
disputation
into
their
own
natural
and
yet
no
dry
nurse
being
so
well
appointed
by
the
milch
further
on
he
says
emperor
justinian
said
when
he
made
the
institutes
of
force
that
the
students
were
happy
in
having
such
a
foredeal
as
to
hear
him
at
once
and
not
to
wait
four
years
first
and
doth
not
our
languaging
hold
us
back
four
years
and
that
full
think
you
but
this
is
not
all
our
best
understanding
is
in
our
natural
tongue
and
all
our
foreign
learning
is
applied
to
our
use
by
means
of
our
own
and
without
the
application
to
particular
use
wherefore
serves
learning
as
for
dishonouring
antiquity
if
we
must
cleave
to
the
eldest
and
not
the
best
we
should
be
eating
acorns
and
wearing
old
pelts
but
why
not
all
in
english
a
tongue
of
itself
both
deep
in
conceit
and
frank
in
delivery
i
do
not
think
that
any
language
be
it
whatsoever
is
better
able
to
utter
all
arguments
either
with
more
pith
or
greater
plainness
than
our
english
tongue
is
it
is
our
accident
which
restrains
our
tongue
and
not
the
tongue
itself
which
will
strain
with
the
strongest
and
stretch
to
the
furthest
for
either
government
if
we
were
conquerors
or
for
cunning
if
we
were
treasurers
not
any
whit
behind
either
the
subtle
greek
for
crouching
close
or
the
stately
latin
for
spreading
i
have
seen
marcel
referred
to
as
a
great
authority
in
education
but
i
look
in
vain
for
his
name
in
cyclopædia
and
in
you
would
be
more
successful
in
there
i
see
that
claude
marcel
was
born
at
paris
in
and
died
in
he
was
one
of
soldiers
after
absence
from
france
dating
from
he
went
back
to
paris
he
had
been
french
consul
at
cork
and
brought
up
nine
children
whom
he
taught
entirely
himself
in
he
published
with
chapman
and
hall
his
as
a
means
of
mental
this
book
was
not
very
well
named
for
it
contains
in
fact
an
analysis
of
the
to
the
study
of
this
subject
marcel
must
have
given
his
life
and
it
seems
odd
that
his
contribution
to
english
not
french
pedagogic
literature
is
so
little
known
a
french
abridgment
of
his
work
appeared
in
with
the
title
principes
and
in
he
published
in
french
des
paris
borrani
of
which
a
translation
was
published
in
the
notion
of
education
is
threefold
physical
intellectual
and
moral
education
the
aiming
at
and
the
at
and
the
of
the
at
and
according
to
him
the
creator
has
made
the
exercise
of
our
faculties
this
will
suggest
his
main
lines
he
expects
to
find
general
assent
for
he
quotes
from
garrick
doctrine
meets
with
general
approbation
is
not
heresy
but
but
he
has
met
with
less
approbation
than
neglect
his
that
i
quoted
in
the
old
appendix
were
abused
without
mercy
by
a
critic
of
those
days
who
accused
me
of
for
putting
them
in
on
the
other
hand
my
last
american
reprinter
singles
them
out
for
honour
and
puts
them
at
the
beginning
of
the
book
after
this
i
suppose
somebody
likes
them
so
here
they
are
truths
of
the
method
of
nature
is
the
archetype
of
all
methods
and
especially
of
the
method
of
learning
languages
the
classification
of
the
objects
of
study
should
mark
out
to
teacher
and
learner
their
respective
spheres
of
action
the
ultimate
objects
of
the
study
should
always
be
kept
in
view
that
the
end
be
not
forgotten
in
pursuit
of
the
means
the
means
ought
to
be
consistent
with
the
end
example
and
practice
are
more
efficient
than
precept
and
theory
only
one
thing
should
be
taught
at
one
time
and
an
accumulation
of
difficulties
should
be
avoided
especially
in
the
beginning
of
the
study
instruction
should
proceed
from
the
known
to
the
unknown
from
the
simple
to
the
complex
from
concrete
to
abstract
notions
from
analysis
to
synthesis
the
mind
should
be
impressed
with
the
idea
before
it
takes
cognisance
of
the
sign
that
represents
it
the
development
of
the
intellectual
powers
is
more
important
than
the
acquisition
of
knowledge
each
should
be
made
auxiliary
to
the
other
all
the
faculties
should
be
equally
exercised
and
exercised
in
a
way
consistent
with
the
exigencies
of
active
life
the
protracted
exercise
of
the
faculties
is
injurious
a
change
of
occupation
renews
the
energy
of
their
action
no
exercise
should
be
so
difficult
as
to
discourage
exertion
nor
so
easy
as
to
render
it
unnecessary
attention
is
secured
by
making
study
interesting
first
impressions
and
early
habits
are
the
most
important
because
they
are
the
most
enduring
what
the
learner
discovers
by
mental
exertion
is
better
known
than
what
is
told
him
learners
should
not
do
with
their
instructor
what
they
can
do
by
themselves
that
they
may
have
time
to
do
with
him
what
they
can
not
do
by
themselves
the
monitorial
principle
multiplies
the
benefits
of
public
instruction
by
teaching
we
learn
the
more
concentrated
is
the
teaching
the
more
comprehensive
and
efficient
his
instruction
in
a
class
the
time
must
be
so
employed
that
no
learner
shall
be
idle
and
the
business
so
contrived
that
learners
of
different
degrees
of
advancement
shall
derive
equal
advantage
from
the
instructor
repetition
must
mature
into
a
habit
what
the
learner
wishes
to
remember
young
persons
should
be
taught
only
what
they
are
capable
of
clearly
understanding
and
what
may
be
useful
to
them
in
what
do
think
of
these
i
confess
they
bring
into
my
mind
the
advice
given
to
a
learner
in
billiards
in
doubt
cannon
and
pocket
the
first
catch
your
of
nature
as
glass
might
have
said
as
to
no
again
who
shall
say
what
the
are
and
is
smelling
a
faculty
that
must
be
equally
exercised
with
seeing
when
the
young
marcels
went
to
paris
i
fancy
they
found
there
far
more
that
was
worth
seeing
than
worth
smelling
after
what
you
have
said
about
i
infer
you
do
not
advocate
the
not
exactly
teaching
we
this
is
very
true
but
if
we
teach
we
learn
by
teaching
but
may
we
not
gain
by
trying
to
teach
and
short
of
teaching
a
good
deal
may
be
done
by
monitors
if
by
the
monitorial
principle
we
mean
the
young
to
make
themselves
it
is
a
capital
principle
and
in
your
sturm
essay
you
say
art
always
has
taken
and
i
suppose
in
the
main
always
will
take
for
its
material
the
means
of
surely
the
signs
of
the
times
do
not
indicate
this
have
not
the
tongue
and
the
pen
had
their
day
and
is
not
the
schoolmaster
turning
his
attention
from
them
not
perhaps
to
the
brain
but
certainly
to
the
eye
and
the
hand
it
has
at
length
occurred
to
him
to
ask
like
shylock
not
a
boy
eyes
hath
not
a
boy
hands
and
as
it
seems
certain
that
the
boy
has
these
organs
the
schoolmaster
wants
to
find
employment
for
them
till
now
no
scholastic
use
has
been
found
for
the
eye
except
reading
or
for
the
hand
except
making
strokes
with
the
pen
and
receiving
them
from
the
cane
but
it
will
be
different
in
the
future
words
have
had
their
day
things
will
have
theirs
you
may
be
right
but
be
careful
in
your
use
of
terms
as
is
usually
the
case
with
if
we
want
a
meaning
we
may
take
our
choice
the
contrast
between
and
is
sometimes
between
studies
like
grammar
logic
and
rhetoric
on
the
one
hand
and
on
the
other
studies
which
in
some
way
have
things
for
their
subject
then
again
we
have
as
the
vocal
or
visible
symbols
of
ideas
contrasted
with
the
ideas
themselves
those
who
complain
of
the
time
spent
on
words
are
thinking
some
of
them
of
the
time
spent
on
the
art
of
expression
others
of
the
time
given
to
symbols
which
do
not
to
the
learner
symbolize
anything
but
in
our
day
words
and
things
are
supposed
to
represent
the
study
of
literature
and
the
study
of
natural
science
at
present
there
is
a
rage
for
things
but
it
is
a
little
early
to
adjudicate
on
the
comparative
claims
of
say
homer
and
james
watt
on
the
gratitude
of
mankind
the
great
book
of
our
day
on
education
herbert
would
make
short
work
with
and
yet
two
school
commissions
the
public
schools
commission
of
and
the
middle
schools
commission
of
have
defended
the
first
of
these
says
is
the
logic
of
common
speech
and
there
are
few
educated
men
who
are
not
sensible
of
the
advantages
they
gained
as
boys
from
the
steady
practice
of
composition
and
translation
and
from
their
introduction
to
etymology
the
study
of
literature
is
the
study
not
indeed
of
the
physical
but
of
the
intellectual
and
moral
world
we
live
in
and
of
the
thoughts
lives
and
characters
of
those
men
whose
writings
or
whose
memories
succeeding
generations
have
thought
it
worth
while
to
the
commissioners
on
middle
schools
express
a
similar
opinion
subjects
of
instruction
of
which
the
study
of
language
is
the
beginning
appear
to
have
a
distinctly
greater
educational
power
than
the
as
all
civilisation
really
takes
its
rise
in
human
intercourse
so
the
most
efficient
instrument
of
education
appears
to
be
the
study
which
most
bears
on
that
intercourse
the
study
of
human
speech
nothing
appears
to
develop
and
discipline
the
whole
man
so
much
as
the
study
which
assists
the
learner
to
understand
the
thoughts
to
enter
into
the
feelings
to
appreciate
the
moral
judgments
of
others
there
is
nothing
so
opposed
to
true
cultivation
nothing
so
unreasonable
as
excessive
narrowness
of
mind
and
nothing
contributes
to
remove
this
narrowness
so
much
as
that
clear
understanding
of
language
which
lays
open
the
thoughts
of
others
to
ready
appreciation
nor
is
equal
clearness
of
thought
to
be
obtained
in
any
other
way
clearness
of
thought
is
bound
up
with
clearness
of
language
and
the
one
is
impossible
without
the
other
when
the
study
of
language
can
be
followed
by
that
of
literature
not
only
breadth
and
clearness
but
refinement
becomes
attainable
the
study
of
history
in
the
full
sense
belongs
to
a
still
later
age
for
till
the
learner
is
old
enough
to
have
some
appreciation
of
politics
he
is
not
capable
of
grasping
the
meaning
of
what
he
studies
but
both
literature
and
history
do
but
carry
on
that
which
the
study
of
language
has
begun
the
cultivation
of
all
those
faculties
by
which
man
has
contact
with
middle
schools
report
vol
i
iv
p
as
matthew
arnold
says
in
comparing
two
things
it
is
kind
of
to
be
totally
ignorant
about
one
of
them
and
i
labour
under
this
disadvantage
in
comparing
literature
and
science
but
i
own
i
do
not
expect
the
ultimate
victory
will
be
with
those
who
may
kill
or
even
cure
or
carry
the
body
and
after
that
have
no
more
that
they
can
do
milton
says
of
fine
music
that
it
all
heaven
before
our
similarly
fine
literature
can
at
least
bring
all
earth
and
its
inhabitants
and
the
best
thoughts
and
actions
the
world
has
known
i
remember
matthew
arnold
in
conversation
dwelling
on
the
difference
it
makes
to
us
we
surely
one
of
the
great
things
education
should
do
is
to
enable
and
to
accustom
the
thoughts
of
the
young
to
follow
the
guidance
which
is
offered
us
in
words
of
the
i
like
your
quotation
on
from
john
brown
after
your
fashion
you
have
in
a
note
on
expressed
a
fondness
for
notion
of
the
i
am
there
thinking
of
instruction
about
parts
but
in
most
things
notions
of
the
parts
precede
the
notion
of
the
whole
and
in
this
matter
i
think
seneca
was
wiser
than
comenius
easily
are
we
led
through
the
parts
into
a
conception
of
the
whole
facilius
per
partes
in
cognitionem
totius
ep
a
may
i
ask
to
whom
you
are
indebted
for
this
erudition
to
wuestemann
gotha
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
now
and
then
you
do
not
attach
sufficient
importance
to
the
possession
of
knowledge
and
skill
perhaps
i
do
not
what
i
wish
to
cultivate
is
not
so
much
knowledge
as
the
desire
for
knowledge
and
further
the
activity
of
mind
that
will
turn
knowledge
to
account
knowledge
driven
in
from
without
so
to
speak
and
skill
obtained
by
enforced
practice
are
i
will
not
say
valueless
but
very
different
in
quality
from
the
knowledge
and
skill
that
their
possessor
has
sought
for
knowledge
is
a
tool
he
who
has
acquired
it
without
caring
for
it
will
have
neither
the
skill
nor
the
will
to
use
it
a
does
not
this
apply
to
the
knowledges
recommended
by
herbert
spencer
knowledge
how
to
bring
up
children
and
to
the
knowledge
of
physiological
facts
and
rules
of
health
which
you
yourself
say
would
be
great
practical
certainly
it
does
and
also
to
the
of
our
board
schools
still
more
to
the
lessons
in
morality
which
it
seems
are
at
least
in
france
if
not
elsewhere
to
supersede
religion
if
you
can
get
the
learners
to
care
for
such
lessons
the
lessons
are
worth
giving
if
not
not
care
not
for
the
thing
but
for
the
examination
in
the
thing
is
different
and
can
produce
only
a
very
inferior
article
i
expect
there
are
instances
in
which
care
for
the
examination
develops
into
care
for
the
subject
of
the
examination
but
these
cases
are
so
rare
that
they
may
be
neglected
i
see
you
would
not
take
a
deep
interest
in
the
for
the
diffusion
of
useful
and
yet
how
terrible
are
the
results
of
ignorance
herbert
spencer
is
great
on
knowledge
for
earning
a
livelihood
it
would
add
perhaps
three
or
four
shillings
a
week
to
the
wages
of
the
working
man
if
his
wife
had
learnt
to
cook
in
matters
of
food
the
waste
from
ignorance
among
the
english
poor
is
appalling
in
this
case
the
school
might
do
much
as
girls
would
be
anxious
to
learn
and
though
we
can
not
lay
down
as
a
general
rule
that
it
is
too
late
to
learn
this
rule
might
be
applied
to
cooking
i
see
that
in
govan
a
suburb
of
glasgow
the
widow
of
the
great
john
elder
employs
a
trained
teacher
of
cookery
to
instruct
both
by
demonstrations
and
also
by
visiting
houses
to
which
he
or
she
is
invited
the
results
are
said
to
be
excellent
may
this
good
lady
find
many
imitators
about
learning
poetry
by
heart
did
you
ever
hear
of
the
old
winchester
plan
of
in
the
regular
as
we
called
them
at
harrow
each
boy
had
to
state
in
how
much
homer
and
virgil
he
was
ready
to
the
master
examined
into
the
power
of
saying
this
by
heart
and
of
construing
all
he
said
from
the
very
first
the
boy
always
gave
in
the
poetry
only
adding
to
it
each
time
i
have
heard
of
it
why
i
wonder
was
this
plan
given
up
i
have
asked
old
wykamists
but
nobody
seems
to
know
perhaps
the
quantities
learnt
became
absurdly
large
but
this
method
of
accretion
if
not
overdone
would
leave
something
behind
it
for
life
let
me
show
you
a
passage
from
æschines
agnst
ktesip
which
i
have
seen
not
in
æschines
but
in
among
the
erziehg
bei
it
is
so
simple
that
even
may
construe
it
διὰ
τοῦτο
γὰρ
οἶμαι
ἠμᾶς
παῖδας
ὄντας
τὰς
τῶν
ποιητῶν
γνώμας
ἔκμανθάνειν
ἄνδρες
ὄντὲς
αὐταῖς
χρώμεθα
there
is
very
little
left
of
my
littlego
greek
but
i
will
try
it
is
i
suppose
with
this
object
that
when
we
are
boys
we
thoroughly
commit
to
memory
the
sayings
of
the
order
to
turn
them
to
account
when
we
are
i
wish
the
old
greek
custom
were
continued
i
believe
in
learning
by
heart
what
is
worthy
of
it
see
a
but
the
poetry
that
appeals
to
children
they
grow
out
of
this
can
not
be
said
of
the
best
of
it
but
of
this
best
there
is
to
be
sure
a
very
small
quantity
by
to
i
suppose
you
mean
on
purpose
but
in
a
sense
much
melodious
poetry
appeals
to
children
even
when
they
can
get
only
a
vague
notion
that
it
a
meaning
i
have
known
children
delight
in
splendour
falls
on
castle
walls
and
hohen
linden
pleases
them
much
better
than
anything
of
jane
but
here
at
all
events
there
can
be
no
doubt
about
the
wisdom
of
rule
what
you
most
as
i
have
said
in
an
old
paper
of
mine
to
train
the
no
the
teacher
may
read
aloud
some
selected
pieces
and
let
the
children
separately
for
each
he
can
then
choose
they
most
for
you
think
you
might
give
some
useful
advice
to
young
teachers
about
the
books
they
should
read
i
had
intended
giving
some
advice
but
in
reading
tastes
differ
widely
and
after
all
the
best
advice
is
what
you
most
there
are
three
englishmen
who
have
written
so
well
that
as
it
seems
they
will
be
read
by
teachers
of
all
time
these
are
ascham
locke
and
herbert
spencer
if
a
teacher
does
not
know
these
he
is
not
likely
to
know
or
care
anything
about
the
literature
of
education
these
authors
have
attained
to
the
position
of
classics
by
writing
short
books
in
excellent
english
after
these
i
must
know
something
of
the
student
before
i
ventured
on
a
recommendation
if
he
or
more
probably
be
a
student
indeed
nothing
will
be
found
more
valuable
than
henry
vols
especially
those
of
the
but
the
majority
of
mankind
want
books
that
are
readable
can
be
read
easily
i
do
not
know
any
books
on
teaching
that
i
have
found
easier
reading
than
of
a
and
clay
and
eng
edition
is
hodder
and
but
some
very
valuable
books
are
by
no
means
easy
reading
take
of
trans
by
hailmann
appletons
this
book
is
a
fount
of
ideas
but
froebel
seems
to
want
interpreters
and
happily
he
has
found
them
the
baroness
has
done
good
work
for
him
in
german
and
in
english
he
has
had
good
interpreters
as
miss
shirreff
bowen
and
supt
hailmann
in
the
case
of
froebel
there
is
certainly
a
want
of
literary
talent
but
even
where
this
talent
is
clearly
shown
a
book
may
be
by
no
means
it
may
make
great
demands
on
our
thinking
power
and
thought
is
never
easy
this
will
probably
prevent
and
practice
of
pitt
press
from
ever
being
a
popular
book
though
every
teacher
who
has
read
it
will
feel
that
he
is
the
better
for
it
sometimes
the
size
of
a
book
stands
in
the
way
of
its
popularity
this
seems
to
me
the
case
with
joseph
and
art
of
longmans
but
this
book
is
popular
in
the
united
states
and
i
take
this
as
a
proof
that
the
american
teachers
are
more
in
earnest
than
we
are
all
the
essentials
of
popularity
are
combined
in
on
pitt
press
and
this
is
now
and
long
may
it
continue
one
of
our
most
read
educational
works
a
but
what
about
less
known
books
can
not
you
recommend
anything
as
yet
unknown
to
fame
ah
you
want
me
to
tell
you
what
books
deserve
fame
that
is
into
the
seeds
of
time
say
which
grain
will
grow
and
which
will
but
i
have
no
intention
of
posing
as
the
representative
of
the
readers
of
our
day
still
less
of
the
future
indeed
far
from
being
able
to
tell
you
what
other
people
would
like
or
should
like
i
can
hardly
say
what
i
like
myself
perhaps
i
come
across
a
book
and
read
it
with
delight
remembering
the
very
favourable
impression
made
by
the
first
reading
i
go
back
to
the
book
some
years
afterwards
and
i
then
in
some
cases
can
not
discover
what
it
was
that
pleased
me
a
that
reminds
me
of
similar
sometimes
could
be
sad
to
think
of
to
read
over
many
a
page
poems
withal
of
name
which
at
that
time
did
never
fail
to
entrance
me
and
are
now
dead
in
my
eyes
dead
as
a
theatre
fresh
emptied
of
i
suppose
this
has
happened
to
all
of
us
we
go
back
and
the
things
are
the
same
and
yet
look
so
different
it
is
like
after
the
night
of
an
illumination
looking
at
the
designs
by
daylight
not
many
of
our
designs
will
bear
light
of
common
and
if
we
tried
to
settle
which
we
should
probably
be
quite
wrong
of
my
three
english
educational
classics
one
can
hardly
understand
why
the
peoples
who
speak
english
have
retained
ascham
while
mulcaster
brinsley
and
hoole
are
forgotten
locke
had
his
reputation
as
a
philosopher
to
keep
his
from
neglect
and
yet
at
the
beginning
of
found
that
there
was
no
edition
in
print
perhaps
some
of
the
old
writers
will
come
into
the
field
of
view
again
my
friend
bülbring
of
heidelberg
the
editor
of
de
talks
of
reviving
the
fame
of
mary
astell
who
at
the
end
of
the
seventeenth
century
took
up
the
rights
of
women
and
put
very
vigorously
some
of
the
pet
ideas
of
the
nineteenth
century
i
will
not
ask
you
to
into
the
seeds
of
time
and
i
will
not
take
you
for
a
representative
person
in
any
way
on
these
conditions
perhaps
you
will
give
me
the
names
of
some
of
the
books
that
have
made
such
a
favourable
impression
on
first
least
in
cases
where
that
impression
has
not
been
effaced
by
further
acquaintance
agreed
i
ought
to
begin
with
psychology
but
i
must
with
sorrow
confess
that
i
never
read
a
book
on
the
science
of
mind
so
this
most
important
section
of
the
subject
must
be
omitted
french
and
german
books
i
will
also
omit
unless
they
exist
in
an
english
translation
about
the
historical
and
biographical
part
of
the
subject
i
have
already
named
many
books
such
as
and
of
is
pleasantly
written
but
no
really
satisfactory
history
of
education
can
be
held
in
one
small
volume
this
objection
also
applies
to
of
trans
by
payne
which
is
far
too
full
of
matter
in
it
we
find
but
only
a
very
advanced
student
can
find
little
has
been
written
about
educators
but
there
are
good
accounts
of
bell
lancaster
wilderspin
and
stow
in
macmillans
turning
to
books
about
principles
and
methods
i
have
found
nothing
that
with
reference
to
the
first
stage
of
instruction
seems
to
me
better
than
colonel
on
new
york
kelloggs
more
complete
book
i
have
named
already
of
macmillans
is
a
book
i
read
with
great
delight
for
principles
joseph
payne
seems
to
me
one
of
our
best
educational
writers
and
we
shall
before
long
have
i
hope
the
much
expected
volume
of
his
papers
on
the
history
of
education
some
of
the
smaller
books
that
i
remember
reading
with
especial
gratification
are
jacob
calderwood
lectures
on
pitt
press
and
on
rivingtons
and
on
early
sonnenschein
there
seemed
to
me
a
very
fine
tone
in
a
book
much
read
in
the
united
and
practice
of
of
i
liked
very
much
and
the
book
has
been
revived
by
colonel
parker
kelloggs
there
are
some
books
that
are
worth
getting
opportunity
as
the
germans
say
good
books
now
out
of
print
among
them
i
should
name
in
three
volumes
in
four
de
essays
on
a
liberal
edited
by
farrar
i
know
or
have
known
all
the
books
here
named
but
my
knowledge
and
time
for
reading
do
not
extend
as
far
as
my
bookshelves
and
i
see
before
me
some
books
that
i
have
not
mentioned
and
yet
feel
sure
i
ought
to
mention
among
them
are
on
translated
by
payne
which
seems
an
admirable
compilation
boston
heath
london
sonnenschein
shaw
and
kelloggs
in
which
i
have
seen
some
good
and
boston
silver
rogers
london
paul
i
have
heard
spoken
of
as
an
excellent
book
and
i
like
what
i
have
seen
of
it
but
i
set
out
with
a
promise
to
mention
not
all
our
good
books
but
those
which
i
thought
good
reading
there
still
remain
some
that
fall
under
this
category
and
have
not
been
mentioned
action
of
by
latham
in
public
and
a
pamphlet
from
which
i
formed
a
very
high
estimate
of
the
ability
to
give
us
some
books
about
teaching
i
mean
pot
of
green
by
rooper
what
a
pity
it
is
that
in
english
we
have
no
name
for
when
an
important
truth
has
been
aptly
expressed
the
very
expression
may
be
an
important
event
in
the
history
of
thought
take
words
which
i
observe
you
have
quoted
more
than
once
about
understanding
founding
itself
on
sensible
here
we
have
a
that
might
have
sprung
up
and
yielded
a
rich
crop
of
improvements
in
teaching
if
it
had
only
taken
root
in
minds
why
you
make
a
collection
of
such
i
have
had
thoughts
of
doing
so
and
i
have
a
collection
of
collections
of
in
german
a
well
german
is
the
language
i
should
choose
for
the
expression
of
thought
according
to
heine
in
everything
the
germans
do
there
is
a
thought
embodied
and
we
may
add
that
in
everything
they
say
a
thought
is
embedded
but
i
rather
shrink
from
the
labour
of
digging
it
out
you
would
find
a
collection
of
in
any
language
rather
stiff
reading
and
after
all
the
sayings
which
strike
us
are
just
those
which
give
utterance
to
our
own
thought
this
is
probably
the
reason
why
in
reading
such
a
book
so
few
sayings
seem
to
us
worthy
of
selection
i
had
intended
prefacing
these
essays
with
some
mottoes
as
hodgson
used
to
do
when
he
wrote
but
finally
i
have
left
my
readers
to
collect
for
themselves
i
should
like
to
know
the
sort
of
thing
you
intended
for
your
here
is
one
of
them
from
professor
stanley
hall
of
worcester
mass
life
in
all
its
departments
is
ruled
by
experts
and
by
those
who
have
attained
the
mastery
that
comes
by
new
england
of
february
a
according
to
you
sayings
strike
us
only
when
they
express
our
own
thought
in
that
case
professor
saying
would
not
make
much
impression
on
the
generality
of
your
scholastic
friends
many
of
the
best
paid
schoolmasters
in
england
would
burst
out
laughing
if
anyone
spoke
of
them
as
educational
experts
why
they
have
never
even
thought
of
the
art
of
teaching
leave
alone
the
science
of
education
they
are
who
at
one
time
thought
enough
of
preparing
for
the
tripos
or
the
honour
schools
and
having
got
a
good
degree
they
thought
and
small
blame
to
them
how
to
employ
their
knowledge
of
classics
so
as
to
secure
a
comfortable
income
for
life
accordingly
they
took
a
mastership
and
soon
settled
down
into
the
groove
of
work
but
as
for
the
science
of
education
they
have
thought
of
it
about
as
much
as
they
have
thought
of
the
and
would
probably
tell
you
with
lowe
now
forgotten
as
lord
sherbrooke
that
is
no
such
no
doubt
they
feel
the
force
of
words
the
most
part
the
teacher
who
is
theoretically
inclined
is
lame
in
the
region
of
details
of
it
would
be
a
pity
indeed
if
their
to
make
a
good
income
were
with
the
pale
cast
of
a
they
had
to
think
how
to
prepare
for
the
tripos
and
before
long
they
will
have
to
think
how
to

professor
hall
is
right
the
day
of
the
experts
is
coming
but
does
not
even
harris
warn
teachers
against
being
it
is
rather
jumping
at
conclusions
to
assume
with
some
of
our
countrymen
that
if
a
man
does
not
think
he
does
act
aphorism
which
harris
quotes
is
this
expands
but
lames
action
narrows
but
now
a
good
many
men
who
do
not
expend
energy
in
thought
are
by
no
means
strong
in
action
in
education
they
have
no
desire
either
to
think
the
best
that
is
thought
or
to
do
the
best
that
is
done
they
inquire
about
either
and
they
show
the
most
impartial
ignorance
of
both
like
ridding
they
are
of
opinion
that
professional
knowledge
is
to
be
sought
only
by
persons
without
the
advantages
of
having
been
at
a
public
school
and
of
good
as
for
reading
books
about
teaching
they
leave
that
sort
of
thing
to
national
schoolmasters
and
yet
if
teaching
is
an
art
they
might
get
at
least
as
much
good
from
books
as
the
gets
or
the
marvellous
it
is
when
one
comes
to
consider
the
matter
that
a
man
should
decline
to
receive
instruction
on
a
technical
subject
from
those
who
have
eminently
distinguished
themselves
in
it
and
have
systematised
for
the
benefit
of
others
the
results
of
the
experience
of
a
lifetime
james
payn
who
wrote
this
private
was
thinking
of
books
not
on
teaching
but
on
whist
but
his
words
would
come
home
to
teachers
if
they
took
as
much
interest
in
teaching
as
he
takes
in
whist
i
fancy
you
have
spotted
the
real
deficiency
it
is
want
of
interest
it
is
only
when
a
man
becomes
thoroughly
interested
in
whist
that
he
desires
to
play
better
and
when
he
becomes
thoroughly
interested
in
teaching
that
he
desires
to
teach
better
and
if
only
he
to
improve
he
will
seek
all
the
professional
knowledge
within
his
reach
one
says
matthew
arnold
one
is
aware
how
those
who
want
to
cultivate
any
sense
or
endowment
in
themselves
must
be
habitually
conversant
with
the
works
of
people
who
have
been
eminent
for
that
sense
must
study
them
catch
inspiration
from
them
only
in
this
way
can
progress
be
quoted
by
momerie
let
us
hope
that
you
have
incited
some
young
teachers
to
study
and
catch
inspiration
from
the
great
thinkers
and
workers
in
the
educational
field

is
the
object
i
have
aimed
