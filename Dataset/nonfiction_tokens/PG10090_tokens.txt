peaceless
europe
by
francesco
nitti
preface
in
this
book
are
embodied
the
ideas
which
as
a
parliamentarian
as
head
of
the
italian
government
and
as
a
writer
i
have
upheld
with
firm
conviction
during
the
last
few
years
i
believe
that
europe
is
threatened
with
decadence
more
owing
to
the
peace
treaties
than
as
a
result
of
the
war
she
is
in
a
state
of
daily
increasing
decline
and
the
causes
of
dissatisfaction
are
growing
apace
europe
is
still
waiting
for
that
peace
which
has
not
yet
been
definitely
concluded
and
it
is
necessary
that
the
public
should
be
made
aware
that
the
courses
now
being
followed
by
the
policy
of
the
great
victorious
states
are
perilous
to
the
achievement
of
serious
lasting
and
useful
results
i
believe
that
it
is
to
the
interest
of
france
herself
if
i
speak
the
language
of
truth
as
a
sincere
friend
of
france
and
a
confirmed
enemy
of
german
imperialism
not
only
did
that
imperialism
plunge
germany
into
a
sea
of
misery
and
suffering
covering
her
with
the
opprobrium
of
having
provoked
the
terrible
war
or
at
least
of
having
been
mainly
responsible
for
it
but
it
has
ruined
for
many
years
the
productive
effort
of
the
most
cultured
and
industrious
country
in
europe
some
time
ago
the
of
the
french
republic
poincar√©
after
the
san
remo
conference
of
certain
differences
of
opinion
which
had
arisen
between
lloyd
george
and
myself
on
the
one
hand
and
millerand
on
the
other
wrote
as
follows
italy
and
england
know
what
they
owe
to
france
just
as
france
knows
what
she
owes
to
them
they
do
not
wish
to
part
company
with
us
nor
do
we
with
them
they
recognize
that
they
need
us
as
we
have
need
of
them
lloyd
george
and
nitti
are
statesmen
too
shrewd
and
experienced
not
to
understand
that
their
greatest
strength
will
always
lie
in
this
fundamental
axiom
on
leaving
san
remo
for
rome
or
london
let
them
ask
the
opinion
of
the
in
the
street
his
reply
will
be
tout
restez
unis
avec
la
i
believe
that
lloyd
george
and
i
share
the
same
cordial
sentiments
toward
france
we
have
gone
through
so
much
suffering
and
anxiety
together
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
tear
asunder
links
firmly
welded
by
common
danger
and
pain
france
will
always
remember
with
a
sympathetic
glow
that
italy
was
the
first
country
which
proclaimed
her
neutrality
on
august
without
that
proclamation
the
destinies
of
the
war
might
have
taken
a
very
different
turn
but
the
work
of
reconstruction
in
europe
is
in
the
interest
of
france
herself
she
has
hated
too
deeply
to
render
a
sudden
cessation
of
her
possible
and
the
treaties
have
been
begotten
in
rancour
and
applied
with
violence
even
as
the
life
of
men
the
life
of
peoples
has
days
of
joy
and
days
of
grief
sunshine
follows
the
storm
the
whole
history
of
european
peoples
is
one
of
alternate
victories
and
defeats
it
is
the
business
of
civilization
to
create
such
conditions
as
will
render
victory
less
brutal
and
defeat
more
bearable
the
recent
treaties
which
regulate
or
are
supposed
to
regulate
the
relations
among
peoples
are
as
a
matter
of
fact
nothing
but
a
terrible
regress
the
denial
of
all
those
principles
which
had
been
regarded
as
an
unalienable
conquest
of
public
right
president
wilson
by
his
league
of
nations
has
been
the
most
responsible
factor
in
setting
up
barriers
between
nations
christopher
columbus
sailed
from
europe
hoping
to
land
in
india
whereas
he
discovered
america
president
wilson
sailed
from
america
thinking
that
he
was
going
to
bring
peace
to
europe
but
only
succeeded
in
bringing
confusion
and
war
however
we
should
judge
him
with
the
greatest
indulgence
for
his
intentions
were
undoubtedly
sincere
and
honest
france
has
more
to
gain
than
any
other
country
in
europe
by
reverting
to
those
sound
principles
of
democracy
which
formed
her
erstwhile
glory
we
do
not
forget
what
we
owe
her
nor
the
noble
spirit
which
pervades
some
of
her
historic
deeds
but
and
all
the
more
binding
is
her
duty
to
respect
tradition
when
france
shall
have
witnessed
the
gradual
unfolding
of
approaching
events
she
will
be
convinced
that
he
who
has
spoken
to
her
the
language
of
truth
and
has
sought
out
a
formula
permitting
the
peoples
of
europe
to
rediscover
their
path
in
life
towards
life
is
not
only
a
friend
but
a
friend
who
has
opportunely
brought
back
to
mind
and
heart
the
deeds
of
her
great
ancestors
at
the
time
when
fresh
deeds
of
greatness
and
glory
await
accomplishment
the
task
which
we
must
undertake
with
our
inmost
feeling
with
all
the
ardour
of
our
faith
is
to
find
once
more
the
road
to
peace
to
utter
the
word
of
brotherly
love
toward
oppressed
peoples
and
to
reconstruct
europe
which
is
gradually
sinking
to
the
condition
of
quattrocento
italy
without
its
effulgence
of
art
and
beauty
thirty
states
mutually
diffident
of
each
other
in
a
sea
of
programmes
and
balkan
ideas
towards
the
achievement
of
this
work
of
civilization
the
great
democracies
must
march
shoulder
to
shoulder
at
the
present
moment
i
hear
nothing
but
hostile
voices
but
the
time
is
not
far
distant
when
my
friends
of
france
will
be
marching
with
us
along
the
same
road
they
already
admit
in
private
many
things
which
they
will
presently
be
obliged
to
recognize
openly
many
truths
are
the
fruit
of
persuasion
others
again
are
the
result
of
former
delusions
i
place
my
greatest
trust
in
the
action
of
american
democracy
by
refusing
to
sanction
the
treaty
of
versailles
and
all
the
other
peace
treaties
the
american
senate
has
given
proof
of
the
soundest
political
wisdom
the
united
states
of
america
has
negotiated
its
own
separate
treaties
and
resumes
its
relations
with
victors
and
vanquished
alike
it
follows
that
all
that
has
been
done
hitherto
in
the
way
of
treaties
is
rendered
worthless
as
the
most
important
participant
has
withdrawn
this
is
a
further
motive
for
reflecting
that
it
is
impossible
to
continue
living
much
longer
in
a
europe
divided
by
two
contending
fields
and
by
a
medley
of
rancour
and
hatred
which
tends
to
widen
the
chasm
it
is
of
the
greatest
interest
to
america
that
europe
should
once
more
be
the
wealthy
prosperous
civilized
europe
which
before
ruled
over
the
destinies
of
the
world
only
by
so
great
an
effort
can
the
finest
conquests
of
civilization
come
back
to
their
own
we
should
only
remember
our
dead
in
so
far
as
their
memory
may
prevent
future
generations
from
being
saddened
by
other
war
victims
the
voices
of
those
whom
we
have
lost
should
reach
us
as
voices
praying
for
the
return
of
that
civilization
which
shall
render
massacres
impossible
or
shall
at
least
diminish
the
violence
and
ferocity
of
war
just
as
the
growing
dissolution
of
europe
is
a
common
danger
so
is
the
renewal
of
the
bonds
of
solidarity
a
common
need
let
us
all
work
toward
this
end
even
if
at
first
we
may
be
misunderstood
and
may
find
obstacles
in
our
way
truth
is
on
the
march
and
will
assert
herself
we
shall
strike
the
main
road
after
much
of
dreary
wandering
in
the
dark
lanes
of
prejudice
and
violence
many
of
the
leading
men
of
europe
and
america
who
in
the
intoxication
of
victory
proclaimed
ideas
of
violence
and
revenge
would
now
be
very
glad
to
reverse
their
attitude
of
which
they
see
the
unhappy
results
the
truth
is
that
what
they
privately
recognize
they
will
not
yet
openly
admit
but
no
matter
the
confessions
which
many
of
them
have
made
to
me
both
verbally
and
in
writing
induce
me
to
believe
that
my
ideas
are
also
their
ideas
and
that
they
only
seek
to
express
them
in
the
form
and
on
the
occasions
less
antagonistic
to
the
currents
of
opinion
which
they
themselves
set
up
in
the
days
when
the
chief
object
to
be
achieved
seemed
to
be
the
vivisection
of
the
enemy
recent
events
however
have
entirely
changed
the
situation
as
i
said
before
the
american
senate
has
not
sanctioned
the
treaty
of
versailles
nor
is
it
likely
to
give
it
its
approval
the
united
states
of
america
concludes
separate
treaties
on
its
own
account
agreements
of
a
military
character
had
been
arrived
at
in
paris
the
united
states
of
america
and
great
britain
guaranteed
france
against
any
future
unjust
attack
by
germany
the
american
senate
did
not
sanction
the
agreement
in
fact
it
did
not
even
discuss
it
the
house
of
commons
had
approved
it
subordinate
to
the
consent
of
the
united
states
italy
has
kept
aloof
from
all
alliances
as
a
result
of
this
situation
the
four
entente
powers
allied
and
associated
as
formerly
was
the
official
term
have
ceased
to
be
either
allied
or
associated
after
the
end
of
the
war
on
the
other
hand
europe
after
emerging
from
the
war
is
darkened
and
overcast
by
intrigues
secret
agreements
and
dissimulated
plots
fresh
menaces
of
war
and
fresh
explosions
of
dissatisfaction
nothing
can
help
the
cause
of
peace
more
than
giving
a
full
knowledge
of
the
real
situation
to
the
various
peoples
errors
thrive
in
darkness
while
truth
walks
abroad
in
the
full
light
of
day
it
has
been
my
intention
to
lay
before
the
public
those
great
controversies
which
can
not
merely
form
the
object
of
diplomatic
notes
or
of
posthumous
books
presented
to
parliament
in
a
more
or
less
incomplete
condition
after
events
have
become
irreparable
the
sense
of
a
common
danger
threatening
all
alike
will
prove
the
most
persuasive
factor
in
swerving
us
from
the
perilous
route
which
we
are
now
following
as
a
result
of
the
war
the
bonds
of
economic
solidarity
have
been
torn
asunder
the
losers
in
the
war
must
not
only
make
good
their
own
losses
but
according
to
the
treaties
are
expected
to
pay
for
all
the
damage
which
the
war
has
caused
meanwhile
all
the
countries
of
europe
have
only
one
prevailing
fear
german
competition
in
order
to
pay
the
indemnities
imposed
upon
her
and
she
can
only
do
it
by
exporting
goods
germany
is
obliged
to
produce
at
the
lowest
possible
cost
which
necessitates
the
maximum
of
technical
progress
but
exports
at
low
cost
must
in
the
long
run
prove
detrimental
if
not
destructive
to
the
commerce
of
neutral
countries
and
even
to
that
of
the
victors
thus
in
all
tariffs
which
have
already
been
published
or
which
are
in
course
of
preparation
there
is
one
prevailing
object
in
view
that
of
reducing
german
competition
which
practically
amounts
to
rendering
it
impossible
for
her
to
pay
the
war
indemnity
if
winners
and
losers
were
to
abandon
ideas
for
a
while
and
rather
were
to
persuade
themselves
that
the
oppression
of
the
vanquished
can
not
be
lasting
and
that
there
is
no
other
logical
way
out
of
the
difficulty
but
that
of
small
indemnities
payable
in
a
few
years
debiting
to
the
losers
in
tolerable
proportion
all
debts
contracted
towards
great
britain
and
the
united
states
the
european
situation
would
immediately
improve
why
is
europe
still
in
such
a
state
of
economic
disorder
because
the
confusion
of
moral
ideas
persists
in
many
countries
nerves
are
still
as
tense
as
a
bowstring
and
the
language
of
hatred
still
prevails
for
some
countries
as
for
some
social
groups
war
has
not
yet
ceased
to
be
one
hears
now
in
the
countries
of
the
victors
the
same
arguments
used
as
were
current
coin
in
germany
before
the
war
and
during
the
first
phases
of
the
war
only
now
and
then
more
as
a
question
of
habit
than
because
they
are
truly
felt
we
hear
the
words
justice
peace
and
democracy
why
is
the
present
state
of
discomfort
and
dissatisfaction
on
the
increase
because
almost
everywhere
in
continental
europe
in
the
countries
which
have
emerged
from
the
war
the
rate
of
production
is
below
the
rate
of
consumption
and
many
social
groups
instead
of
producing
more
plan
to
possess
themselves
with
violence
of
the
wealth
produced
by
others
at
home
the
social
classes
unable
to
resist
are
threatened
abroad
the
vanquished
equally
unable
to
resist
are
menaced
but
in
the
very
menace
it
is
easy
to
discern
the
anxiety
of
the
winners
confusion
discomfort
and
dissatisfaction
thus
grow
apace
the
problem
of
europe
is
above
all
a
moral
problem
a
great
step
toward
its
solution
will
have
been
accomplished
when
winners
and
losers
persuade
themselves
that
only
by
a
common
effort
can
they
be
saved
and
that
the
best
enemy
indemnity
consists
in
peace
and
joint
labour
now
that
the
enemy
has
lost
all
he
possessed
and
threatens
to
make
us
lose
the
fruits
of
victory
one
thing
is
above
all
others
necessary
the
resumption
not
only
of
the
language
but
of
the
ideas
of
peace
during
one
of
the
last
international
conferences
at
which
i
was
present
and
over
which
i
presided
at
san
remo
after
a
long
exchange
of
views
with
the
british
and
french
premiers
lloyd
george
and
millerand
the
american
journalists
asked
me
to
give
them
my
ideas
on
peace
what
is
the
most
necessary
thing
for
the
maintenance
of
peace
they
inquired
one
thing
only
i
replied
is
necessary
europe
must
smile
once
more
smiles
have
vanished
from
every
lip
nothing
has
remained
but
hatred
menaces
and
nervous
excitement
when
europe
shall
smile
again
she
will
rediscover
her
political
peace
ideas
and
will
drink
once
more
at
the
spring
of
life
class
struggles
at
home
in
their
acutest
form
are
like
the
competition
of
nationalism
abroad
explosions
of
cupidity
masked
by
the
pretext
of
the
country
greatness
the
deeply
rooted
economic
crisis
which
threatens
and
prepares
new
wars
the
deeply
rooted
social
crisis
which
threatens
and
prepares
fresh
conflicts
abroad
are
nothing
but
the
expression
of
a
or
soul
condition
statesmen
are
the
most
directly
responsible
for
the
continuation
of
a
language
of
violence
they
should
be
the
first
to
speak
the
language
of
peace
nitti

peaceless
europe
is
an
entirely
new
book
which
i
have
written
in
my
hermitage
of
acquafredda
facing
the
blue
adriatic
it
contains
however
some
remarks
and
notices
which
have
already
appeared
in
articles
written
by
me
for
the
great
american
agency
the
and
which
have
been
reproduced
by
the
american
papers
i
have
repeatedly
stated
that
i
have
not
published
any
document
which
was
not
meant
for
publication
i
have
availed
myself
of
my
knowledge
of
the
most
important
international
acts
and
of
all
diplomatic
documents
merely
as
a
guide
but
it
is
on
facts
that
i
have
solidly
based
my
considerations
keynes

robert
lansing
have
already
published
some
very
important
things
but
no
secret

recently
however
tardieu

poincar√©
in
the
interest
of
the
french
nationalist
thesis
which
they
sustain
have
published
also
documents
of
a
very
reserved
nature
tardieu
book
is
a
documentary
proof
of
the
french
extremist
attitude
during
the
conference
amply
showing
that
the
present
form
of
peace
has
been
desired
almost
exclusively
by
france

that

have
been
unwilling

preceded

first
year

it
all
seems
terribly
remote
something
like
a
prehistoric
era
not
only
because
the
conditions
of
life
have
changed
but
because
our
viewpoint
on
life
has
swerved
to
a
different
angle
something
like
thirty
million
dead
have
dug
a
chasm
between
two
ages
war
killed
many
millions
disease
accounted
for
many
more
but
the
hardiest
reaper
has
been
famine
the
dead
have
built
up
a
great
cold
barrier
between
the
europe
of
yesterday
and
the
europe
of
we
have
lived
through
two
historic
epochs
not
through
two
different
periods
europe
was
happy
and
prosperous
while
now
after
the
terrible
world
war
she
is
threatened
with
a
decline
and
a
reversion
to
brutality
which
suggest
the
fall
of
the
roman
empire
we
ourselves
do
not
quite
understand
what
is
happening
around
us
more
than
of
europe
is
in
a
state
of
ferment
and
everywhere
there
prevails
a
vague
sense
of
uneasiness
to
encourage
important
collective
works
we
live
as
the
saying
is
from
hand
to
mouth
before
europe
had
enjoyed
a
prolonged
period
of
peace
attaining
a
degree
of
wealth
and
civilization
unrivalled
in
the
past
in
central
europe
germany
had
sprung
up
after
the
napoleonic
invasions
in
the
course
of
a
century
germany
which
a
hundred
years
ago
seemed
of
all
european
countries
the
least
disposed
to
militarism
had
developed
into
a
great
military
monarchy
from
being
the
most
particularist
country
germany
had
in
reality
become
the
most
unified
state
but
what
constituted
her
strength
was
not
so
much
her
army
and
navy
as
the
prestige
of
her
intellectual
development
she
had
achieved
it
laboriously
almost
painfully
on
a
soil
which
was
not
fertile
and
within
a
limited
territory
but
thanks
to
the
tenacity
of
her
effort
she
succeeded
in
winning
a
prominent
place
in
the
for
supremacy
her
universities
her
institutes
for
technical
instruction
her
schools
were
a
model
to
the
whole
world
in
the
course
of
a
few
years
she
had
built
up
a
merchant
fleet
which
seriously
threatened
those
of
other
countries
having
arrived
too
late
to
create
a
real
colonial
empire
of
her
own
such
as
those
of
france
and
england
she
nevertheless
succeeded
in
exploiting
her
colonies
most
intelligently
in
the
field
of
industry
she
appeared
to
beat
all
competitors
from
a
technical
point
of
view
and
even
in
those
industries
which
were
not
hers
by
habit
and
tradition
she
developed
so
powerful
an
organization
as
to
appear
almost
uncanny
germany
held
first
place
not
only
in
the
production
of
iron
but
in
that
of
dyes
and
chemicals
men
went
there
from
all
parts
of
the
world
not
only
to
trade
but
to
acquire
knowledge
an
ominous
threat
weighed
on
the
empire
namely
the
constitution
of
the
state
itself
essentially
militaristic
and
bureaucratic
not
even
in
russia
perhaps
were
the
reins
of
power
held
in
the
hands
of
so
few
men
as
in
germany
and
a
few
years
before
the
world
war
started
one
of
the
leading
european
statesmen
told
me
that
there
was
everything
to
be
feared
for
the
future
of
europe
where
some
three
hundred
millions
the
inhabitants
of
russia
germany
and
about
of
the
whole
continent
were
governed
in
an
almost
irresponsible
manner
by
a
man
without
will
or
intelligence
the
tsar
of
russia
a
madman
without
a
spark
of
genius
the
german
kaiser
and
an
obstinate
old
man
hedged
in
by
his
ambition
the
emperor
of
not
more
than
thirty
persons
he
added
act
as
a
controlling
force
on
these
three
irresponsible
sovereigns
who
might
assume
on
their
own
initiative
the
most
terrible
responsibilities
the
magnificent
spiritual
gifts
of
the
germans
gave
them
an
emanuel
kant
the
greatest
thinker
of
modern
times
beethoven
their
greatest
exponent
of
music
and
goethe
their
greatest
poet
but
the
imperial
germany
which
came
after
the
victory
of
had
limited
the
spirit
of
independence
even
in
the
manifestations
of
literature
and
art
there
still
existed
in
germany
the
most
widely
known
men
of
science
the
best
universities
the
most
schools
but
the
clumsy
mechanism
tended
to
crush
rather
than
to
encourage
all
personal
initiative
great
manifestations
of
art
or
thought
are
not
possible
without
the
most
ample
spiritual
liberty
germany
was
the
most
highly
organized
country
from
a
scientific
point
of
view
but
at
the
same
time
the
country
in
which
there
was
the
least
liberty
for
individual
initiative
it
went
on
like
a
huge
machine
that
explains
why
it
almost
stopped
after
being
damaged
by
the
war
and
the
whole
life
of
the
nation
was
paralysed
while
there
were
very
few
individual
impulses
of
reaction
imperial
germany
has
always
been
lacking
in
political
ability
perhaps
not
only
through
a
temperamental
failing
but
chiefly
owing
to
her
militaristic
education
before
the
war
germany
beat
her
neighbours
in
all
the
branches
of
human
labour
in
science
industry
banking
commerce
etc
but
in
one
thing
she
did
not
succeed
and
succeeded
still
less
after
the
war
namely
in
politics
when
the
german
people
was
blessed
with
a
political
genius
such
as
frederick
the
great
or
bismarck
it
achieved
the
height
of
greatness
and
glory
but
when
the
same
people
after
obtaining
the
maximum
of
power
found
on
its
path
william
ii
with
his
mediocre
collaborators
it
ruined
by
war
a
colossal
work
not
only
to
the
great
detriment
of
the
country
but
also
to
that
of
the
victors
themselves
of
whom
it
can
not
be
said
with
any
amount
of
certainty
so
far
as
those
of
the
continent
are
concerned
whether
they
are
the
winners
or
the
losers
so
great
is
the
ruin
threatening
them
and
so
vast
the
material
and
moral
losses
sustained
i
have
always
felt
the
deepest
aversion
for
william
ii
so
few
as
ten
years
ago
he
was
still
treated
with
the
greatest
sympathy
both
in
europe
and
america
even
democracies
regarded
with
admiration
the
work
of
the
kaiser
who
brought
everywhere
his
voice
his
enthusiasm
his
activity
to
the
service
of
germany
as
a
matter
of
fact
his
speeches
were
poor
in
phraseology
a
mere
conglomerate
of
violence
prejudice
and
ignorance
as
no
one
believed
in
the
possibility
of
a
war
no
one
troubled
about
it
but
after
the
war
nothing
has
been
more
harmful
to
germany
than
the
memory
of
those
ugly
speeches
unrelieved
by
any
noble
idea
and
full
of
a
clumsy
vulgarity
draped
in
a
solemn
and
majestic
garb
some
of
his
threatening
utterances
such
as
the
address
to
the
troops
sailing
for
china
in
order
to
quell
the
boxer
rebellion
the
constant
association
in
all
his
speeches
of
the
great
idea
of
god
with
the
ravings
of
a
megalomaniac
the
frenzied
oratory
in
which
he
indulged
at
the
beginning
of
the
war
have
harmed
germany
more
than
anything
else
it
is
possible
to
lose
nobly
but
to
have
lost
a
great
war
after
having
won
so
many
battles
would
not
have
harmed
the
german
people
if
it
had
not
been
represented
abroad
by
the
presumptuous
vulgarity
of
the
kaiser
and
of
all
the
members
of
his
entourage
who
were
more
or
less
guilty
of
the
same
attitude
before
the
war
germany
had
everywhere
attained
first
place
in
all
forms
of
activity
excepting
perhaps
in
certain
spiritual
and
artistic
manifestations
she
admired
herself
too
much
and
too
openly
but
succeeded
in
affirming
her
magnificent
expansion
in
a
greatness
and
prosperity
without
rival
by
common
accord
germany
held
first
place
probably
this
consciousness
of
power
together
with
the
somewhat
brutal
forms
of
the
struggle
for
industrial
supremacy
as
in
the
case
of
the
iron
industry
threw
a
mysterious
and
threatening
shadow
over
the
granitic
edifice
of
the
empire
when
i
was
minister
of
commerce
in
i
received
a
deputation
of
german
business
men
who
wished
to
confer
with
me
on
the
italian
customs
regime
they
spoke
openly
of
the
necessity
of
possessing
themselves
of
the
iron
mines
of
french
lorraine
they
looked
upon
war
as
an
industrial
fact
germany
had
enough
coal
but
not
enough
iron
and
the
press
of
the
iron
industry
trumpeted
forth
loud
notes
of
war
after
the
conclusion
of
peace
when
france
through
a
series
of
wholly
unexpected
events
saw
germany
prostrate
at
her
feet
and
without
an
army
the
same
phenomenon
took
place
the
iron
industry
tends
to
affirm
itself
in
france
she
has
the
iron
and
now
she
wants
coal
should
she
succeed
in
getting
it
german
production
would
be
doomed
to
deprive
germany
of
upper
silesia
would
mean
killing
production
after
having
disorganized
it
at
the
very
roots
of
its
development
seven
years
ago
or
thereabouts
germany
was
flourishing
in
an
unprecedented
manner
and
presented
the
most
favourable
conditions
for
developing
her
powerful
demographic
structure
was
almost
unique
placed
in
the
centre
of
europe
after
having
withstood
the
push
of
so
many
peoples
she
had
attained
an
unrivalled
economic
position
close
to
germany
the
empire
united
together
eleven
different
peoples
not
without
difficulty
and
this
union
tended
to
the
common
elevation
of
all
the
vast
monarchy
the
result
of
a
slow
aggregation
of
violence
and
of
administrative
wisdom
represented
perhaps
the
most
interesting
historic
attempt
on
the
part
of
different
peoples
to
achieve
a
common
rule
and
discipline
on
the
same
territory
having
successfully
weathered
the
most
terrible
financial
crises
and
having
healed
in
half
a
century
the
wounds
of
two
great
wars
which
she
had
lost
lived
in
the
effort
of
holding
together
germans
magyars
slavs
and
italians
without
their
flying
at
each
others
throats
time
will
show
how
the
effort
of
has
not
been
lost
for
civilization
russia
represented
the
largest
empire
which
has
ever
been
in
existence
and
in
spite
of
its
defective
political
regime
was
daily
progressing
perhaps
for
the
first
time
in
history
an
immense
empire
of
millions
and
a
half
of
square
kilometres
times
the
size
of
italy
almost
three
times
as
large
as
the
united
states
of
america

ruled
by
a
single
man
from
the
baltic
to
the
yellow
sea
from
finland
to
the
caucasus
one

and
one
rule

the
most
different

over
an
immense
territory

methods
by
which
after
peter
the
great
the
old
duchy
of
muscovy
had
been
transformed
into
an
empire
still
lived
in
the
administration
they
survive
in
the
bolshevist
organization
which
represents
less
a
revolution
than
a
hieratic
and
brutal
form
of
violence
placed
at
the
service
of
a
political
organization
the
war
between
russia
and
japan
had
revealed
all
the
perils
of
a
political
organization
exclusively
based
on
central
authority
represented
by
a
few
irresponsible
men
under
the
apparent
rule
of
a
sovereign
not
gifted
with
the
slightest
trace
of
will
power
those
who
exalt
nationalist
sentiments
and
pin
their
faith
on
imperialistic
systems
fail
to
realize
that
while
the
greatest
push
towards
the
war
came
from
countries
living
under
a
less
liberal
regime
those
very
countries
gave
proof
of
the
least
power
of
resistance
modern
war
means
the
full
exploitation
of
all
the
human
and
economic
resources
of
each
belligerent
country
the
greater
a
nation
wealth
the
greater
is
the
possibility
to
hold
out
and
the
perfection
of
arms
and
weapons
is
in
direct
ratio
with
the
degree
of
technical
progress
attained
moreover
the
combatants
and
the
possibility
of
using
them
are
in
relation
with
the
number
of
persons
who
possess
sufficient
skill
and
instruction
to
direct
the
war
germany
great
britain
france
italy
the
united
states
of
america
were
able
without
any
appreciable
effort
to
improvise
an
enormous
number
of
officers
for
the
war
transforming
professional
men
engineers
and
technicians
into
officers
russia
who
did
not
have
a
real
industrial
bourgeoisie
nor
a
sufficient
development
of
the
middle
classes
was
only
able
to
furnish
an
enormous
number
of
combatants
but
an
insufficient
organization
from
a
technical
and
military
point
of
view
and
a
very
limited
number
of
officers
while
on
a
peace
footing
her
army
was
the
most
numerous
in
the
world
over
one
million
three
hundred
thousand
men
when
her
officers
began
to
fail
russia
was
unable
to
replace
them
so
rapidly
as
the
proportion
of
nine
or
ten
times
more
than
normal
required
by
the
war
russia
has
always
had
a
latent
force
of
development
there
is
within
her
a
equivalent
to
a
mysterious
energy
of
expansion
her
is
higher
than
that
of
any
other
european
country
she
does
not
progress
she
increases
her
weight
acts
as
a
menace
to
neighbouring
countries
and
as
by
a
mysterious
historic
law
the
primitive
migrations
of
peoples
and
the
ancient
invasions
mostly
originated
from
the
territories
now
occupied
by
russia
the
latter
has
succeeded
in
amalgamating
widely
different
peoples
and
in
creating
unity
where
no
affinity
appeared
possible
at
any
rate
although
suffering
from
an
excessively
centralized
government
and
a
form
of
constitution
which
did
not
allow
the
development
of
popular
energies
nor
a
sufficient
education
of
the
people
russia
was
perhaps
half
a
century
before
the
war
the
european
country
which
considering
the
difficulties
in
her
path
had
accomplished
most
progress
european
russia
with
her
yearly
excess
of
from
one
million
and
a
half
to
two
million
births
over
deaths
with
the
development
of
her
industries
and
the
formation
of
important
commercial
centres
progressed
very
rapidly
and
was
about
to
become
the
pivot
of
european
politics
when
it
will
be
possible
to
examine
carefully
the
diplomatic
documents
of
the
war
and
time
will
allow
us
to
judge
them
calmly
it
will
be
seen
that
russia
attitude
was
the
real
and
underlying
cause
of
the
she
alone
promoted
and
kept
alive
the
agitations
in
serbia
and
of
the
slavs
in
austria
she
alone
in
germany
eyes
represented
the
peril
of
the
future
germany
has
never
believed
in
a
french
danger
she
knew
very
well
that
france
single
handed
could
never
have
withstood
germany
numerically
so
much
her
superior
russia
was
the
only
danger
that
germany
saw
and
the
continual
increase
of
the
russian
army
was
her
gravest
preoccupation
before
the
war
when
italy
was
germany
ally
the
leading
german
statesmen
with
whom
i
had
occasion
to
discuss
the
situation
did
nothing
but
allude
to
the
russian
peril
it
was
known
and
subsequent
facts
have
amply
proved
it
that
the
tsar
was
absolutely
devoid
of
will
power
that
he
was
led
and
carried
away
by
conflicting
currents
and
that
his
advisers
were
for
the
most
part
favourable
to
the
war
after
the
japanese
defeat
the
militarist
party
felt
keenly
the
need
for
just
such
a
great
military
revival
and
a
brilliant
in
europe
possessing
an
enormous
wealth
of
raw
materials
and
an
immense
territory
russia
represented
europe
great
resource
her
support
for
the
future
if
the
three
great
empires
had
attained
enviable
prosperity
and
development
in
when
the
war
burst
the
three
great
western
democracies
great
britain
france
and
italy
had
likewise
progressed
immensely
great
britain
proud
of
her
splendid
isolation
and
ruler
of
the
seas
traded
in
every
country
of
the
world
having
the
vastest
empire
she
was
also
financially
the
greatest
creditor
country
creditor
of
america
and
asia
of
the
new
african
states
and
of
australia
perhaps
all
this
wealth
had
somewhat
diminished
the
spirit
of
enterprise
before
the
war
and
popular
culture
also
suffered
from
this
unprecedented
prosperity
there
was
not
the
spasmodic
effort
noticeable
in
germany
but
a
continuous
and
secure
expansion
an
undisputed
supremacy
although
somewhat
preoccupied
at
progress
and
regarding
it
as
a
peril
for
the
future
great
britain
attached
more
importance
to
the
problems
of
her
empire
namely
to
her
internal
constitution
like
ancient
rome
she
was
a
truly
imperial
country
in
the
security
of
her
supremacy
in
her
calm
in
her
forbearance
france
continued
patiently
to
accumulate
wealth
she
did
not
increase
her
population
but
ably
added
to
her
territory
and
her
savings
threatened
with
the
phenomenon
known
to
political
economists
under
the
name
of
oliganthropy
or
lack
of
men
she
had
founded
a
colonial
empire
which
may
be
regarded
as
the
largest
on
earth
it
is
true
that
the
british
colonies
even
before
the
war
covered
an
area
of
thirty
million
square
kilometres
while
france
colonial
empire
was
slightly
over
twelve
millions
but
it
must
be
remembered
that
the
british
colonies
are
not
colonies
in
the
real
sense
of
the
word
but
consist
chiefly
in
dominions
which
enjoy
an
almost
complete
autonomy
canada
alone
represents
about
of
the
territories
of
the
british

more
than
of
the

while
india
accounts
for
about
fifty
per

of
the
missing
third
after
england
france
was
the
most
important
creditor
country
her
astonishing
capacity
for
saving
increased
in
proportion
with
her
wealth
without
having
force
of
development
and
great
britain
power
of
expansion
france
enjoyed
a
wonderful
prosperity
and
her
wealth
was
scattered
all
over
the
world
italy
had
arisen
under
the
greatest
difficulties
but
in
less
than
fifty
years
of
unity
she
progressed
steadily
having
a
territory
too
small
and
mountainous
for
a
population
already
overflowing
and
constantly
on
the
increase
italy
had
been
unable
to
exploit
the
limited
resources
of
her
subsoil
and
had
been
forced
to
build
up
her
industries
in
conditions
far
less
favourable
than
those
of
other
countries
italy
is
perhaps
the
only
nation
which
has
succeeded
in
forming
her
industries
without
having
any
coal
of
her
own
and
very
little
iron
but
the
acquisition
of
wealth
extremely
difficult
at
first
had
gradually
been
rendered
more
easy
by
the
improvement
in
technical
instruction
and
methods
for
the
most
part
borrowed
from
germany
on
the
eve
of
the
war
after
a
period
of
years
the
triple
alliance
had
rendered
the
greatest
services
to
italy
fully
confirming
crispi
political
intuition
france
with
whom
we
had
had
serious
differences
of
opinion
especially
after
the
tunis
affair
did
not
dare
to
threaten
italy
because
the
latter
belonged
to
the
triple
alliance
and
for
the
same
reason
all
ideas
of
a
conflict
with
had
been
set
aside
because
of
her
forming
part
of
the
triplice
during
the
triple
alliance
italy
built
up
all
her
industries
she
consolidated
her
national
unity
and
prepared
her
economic
transformation
which
was
fraught
with
considerable
difficulties
suddenly
her
sons
spread
all
over
the
world
stimulated
by
the
fecundity
of
their
race
and
by
the
narrowness
of
their
fields
the
greater
states
were
surrounded
by
minor
nations
which
had
achieved
considerable
wealth
and
great
prosperity
europe
throughout
her
history
had
never
been
so
rich
so
far
advanced
on
the
road
to
progress
above
all
so
united
and
living
in
her
unity
as
regards
production
and
exchanges
she
was
really
a
living
unity
the
vital
lymph
was
not
limited
to
this
or
that
country
but
flowed
with
an
even
current
through
the
veins
and
arteries
of
the
various
nations
through
the
great
organizations
of
capital
and
labour
promoting
a
continuous
and
increasing
solidarity
among
all
the
parties
concerned
in
fact
the
idea
of
solidarity
had
greatly
progressed
economic
moral
and
spiritual
solidarity
moreover
the
idea
of
peace
although
threatened
by
military
oligarchies
and
by
industrial
corners
was
firmly
based
on
the
sentiments
of
the
great
majority
the
strain
of
barbaric
blood
which
still
ferments
in
many
populations
of
central
europe
constituted
it
is
true
a
standing
menace
but
no
one
dreamt
that
the
threat
was
about
to
be
followed
lightning
like
by
facts
and
that
we
were
on
the
eve
of
a
catastrophe
europe
had
forgotten
what
hunger
meant
never
had
europe
had
at
her
disposal
such
abundant
economic
resources
or
a
greater
increase
in
wealth
wealth
is
not
our
final
object
in
life
but
a
minimum
of
means
is
an
indispensable
condition
of
life
and
happiness
excessive
wealth
may
lead
both
to
moral
elevation
and
to
depression
and
ruin
europe
had
not
only
increased
her
wealth
but
developed
the
solidarity
of
her
interests
europe
is
a
small
continent
about
as
large
as
canada
or
the
united
states
of
america
but
her
economic
ties
and
interests
had
been
steadily
on
the
increase
now
the
development
of
her
wealth
meant
for
europe
the
development
of
her
moral
ideas
and
of
her
social
life
and
aspirations
we
admire
a
country
not
so
much
for
its
wealth
as
for
the
works
of
civilization
which
that
wealth
enables
it
to
accomplish
although
peace
be
the
aspiration
of
all
peoples
even
as
physical
health
is
the
aspiration
of
all
living
beings
there
are
wars
which
can
not
be
avoided
as
there
are
diseases
which
help
us
to
overcome
an
organic
crisis
to
which
we
might
otherwise
succumb
war
and
peace
can
not
be
regarded
as
absolutely
bad
or
absolutely
good
and
desirable
war
is
often
waged
in
order
to
secure
peace
in
certain
cases
war
is
not
only
a
necessary
condition
of
life
but
may
be
an
indispensable
condition
towards
progress
we
must
consider
and
analyse
the
sentiments
and
psychological
causes
which
bring
about
a
war
a
war
waged
to
redeem
its
independence
by
a
nation
downtrodden
by
another
nation
is
perfectly
legitimate
even
from
the
point
of
view
of
abstract
morality
a
war
which
has
for
its
object
the
conquest
of
political
or
religious
liberty
can
not
be
condemned
even
by
the
most
confirmed
pacificist
taken
as
a
whole
the
wars
fought
in
the
nineteenth
century
wars
of
nationality
of
independence
of
unity
even
colonial
wars
were
of
a
character
far
less
odious
than
that
of
the
great
conflict
which
has
devastated
europe
and
upset
the
economic
conditions
of
the
world
it
has
not
only
been
the
greatest
war
in
history
but
in
its
consequences
it
threatens
to
prove
the
worst
war
which
has
ravaged
europe
in
modern
times
after
nearly
every
war
there
has
been
a
marked
revival
of
human
activity
but
this
unprecedented
clash
of
peoples
has
reduced
the
energy
of
all
it
has
darkened
the
minds
of
men
and
spread
the
spirit
of
violence
europe
will
be
able
to
make
up
for
her
losses
in
lives
and
wealth
time
heals
even
the
most
painful
wounds
but
one
thing
she
has
lost
which
if
she
does
not
succeed
in
recovering
it
must
necessarily
lead
to
her
decline
and
fall
the
spirit
of
solidarity
after
the
victory
of
the
entente
the
microbes
of
hate
have
developed
and
flourished
in
special
cultures
consisting
of
national
egotism
imperialism
and
a
mania
for
conquest
and
expansion
the
peace
treaties
imposed
on
the
vanquished
are
nothing
but
arms
of
oppression
what
more
could
germany
herself
have
done
had
she
won
the
war
perhaps
her
terms
would
have
been
more
lenient
certainly
not
harder
as
she
would
have
understood
that
conditions
such
as
we
have
imposed
on
the
losers
are
simply
inapplicable
three
years
have
elapsed
since
the
end
of
the
war
two
since
the
conclusion
of
peace
nevertheless
europe
has
still
more
men
under
arms
than
in
times
the
sentiment
of
nationality
twisted
and
transformed
into
nationalism
aims
at
the
subjugation
and
depression
of
other
peoples
no
civilized
is
possible
where
each
nation
proposes
to
harm
instead
of
helping
its
neighbour
the
spread
of
hatred
among
peoples
has
everywhere
rendered
more
difficult
the
internal
relations
between
social
classes
and
the
economic
life
of
each
country
fearing
a
repetition
of
armed
conflicts
and
owing
to
that
spirit
of
unrest
and
intolerance
engendered
everywhere
by
the
war
workers
are
becoming
every
day
more
exacting
they
too
claim
their
share
of
the
spoils
they
too
clamour
for
enemy
indemnities
the
same
manifestations
of
hate
the
same
violence
of
language
spread
from
people
to
people
and
from
class
to
class
this
tremendous
war
which
the
peoples
of
europe
have
fought
and
suffered
has
not
only
bled
the
losers
almost
to
death
but
it
has
deeply
perturbed
the
very
life
and
existence
of
the
victors
it
has
not
produced
a
single
manifestation
of
art
or
a
single
moral
affirmation
for
the
last
seven
years
the
universities
of
europe
appear
to
be
stricken
with
paralysis
not
one
outstanding
personality
has
been
revealed
in
almost
every
country
the
war
has
brought
a
sense
of
internal
dissolution
everywhere
this
disquieting
phenomenon
is
more
or
less
noticeable
with
the
exception
perhaps
of
great
britain
whose
privileged
insular
situation
enormous
mercantile
navy
and
flourishing
trade
in
coal
have
enabled
her
to
resume
her
economic
existence
almost
entirely
no
country
has
emerged
scatheless
from
the
war
the
rates
of
exchange
soar
daily
to
fantastic
heights
and
insuperable
barriers
to
the
commerce
of
european
nations
are
being
created
people
work
less
than
they
did
in
times
but
everywhere
a
tendency
is
noticeable
to
consume
more
austria
germany
italy
france
are
not
different
phenomena
but
different
manifestations
and
phases
of
the
same
phenomenon
before
the
war
europe
in
spite
of
her
great
represented
a
living
economic
whole
there
are
not
only
victors
and
vanquished
but
currents
of
hate
ferments
of
violence
a
hungering
after
conquests
an
unscrupulous
cornering
of
raw
materials
carried
out
brutally
and
almost
ostentatiously
in
the
name
of
the
rights
of
victory
a
situation
which
renders
production
let
alone
its
development
and
increase
utterly
impossible
the
treaty
system
as
applied
after
the
war
has
divided
europe
into
two
distinct
parts
the
losers
held
under
the
military
and
economic
control
of
the
victors
are
expected
to
produce
not
only
enough
for
their
own
needs
but
to
provide
a
in
order
to
indemnify
the
winners
for
all
the
losses
and
damages
sustained
on
account
of
the
war
the
victors
bound
together
in
what
is
supposed
to
be
a
permanent
alliance
for
the
protection
of
their
common
interests
are
supposed
to
exercise
a
military
action
of
oppression
and
control
over
the
losers
until
the
full
payment
of
the
indemnity
another
part
of
europe
is
in
a
state
of
revolutionary
ferment
and
the
entente
powers
have
by
their
attitude
rather
tended
to
aggravate
than
to
improve
the
situation
europe
can
only
recover
her
peace
of
mind
by
remembering
that
the
war
is
over
and
done
with
unfortunately
the
treaty
system
not
only
prevents
us
from
remembering
that
the
war
is
finished
but
determines
a
state
of
permanent
war
clemenceau
bluntly
declared
to
the
french
chamber
that
treaties
were
a
means
of
continuing
the
war
he
was
perfectly
right
for
war
is
being
waged
more
bitterly
than
ever
and
peace
is
as
remote
as
it
ever
was
the
problem
with
which
modern
statesmen
are
confronted
is
very
simple
can
europe
continue
in
her
decline
without
involving
the
ruin
of
civilization
and
is
it
possible
to
stop
this
process
of
decay
without
finding
some
form
of
civil
symbiosis
which
will
ensure
for
all
men
a
more
human
mode
of
living
in
the
affirmative
case
what
course
should
we
take
and
is
it
presumable
that
there
should
be
an
immediate
change
for
the
better
in
the
situation
given
the
national
and
economic
interests
now
openly
and
bitterly
in
conflict
we
have
before
us
a
problem
or
rather
a
series
of
problems
which
call
for
impartiality
and
calm
if
a
satisfactory
solution
is
to
be
arrived
at
perhaps
if
some
fundamental
truths
were
brought
home
to
the
people
or
to
be
more
exact
to
the
peoples
now
at
loggerheads
with
each
other
a
notion
of
the
peril
equally
impending
upon
all
concerned
and
the
conviction
that
an
indefinite
prolongation
of
the
present
state
of
things
is
impossible
would
prove
decisive
factors
in
restoring
a
spirit
of
peace
and
in
reviving
that
spirit
of
solidarity
which
now
appears
spent
or
slumbering
but
in
the
first
place
it
is
necessary
to
review
the
situation
such
as
it
is
at
the
present
moment
firstly
europe
which
was
the
creditor
of
all
other
continents
has
now
become
their
debtor
secondly
her
working
capacity
has
greatly
decreased
chiefly
owing
to
the
negative
change
in
her
demographic
structure
in
times
the
ancient
continent
supplied
new
continents
and
new
territories
with
a
hardy
race
of
pioneers
and
held
the
record
as
regards
population
both
adult
and
infantile
the
prevalence
of
women
over
men
being
especially
noted
by
statisticians
all
this
has
changed
considerably
for
the
worse
thirdly
on
the
losing
nations
including
germany
which
is
generally
understood
to
be
the
most
cultured
nation
in
the
world
the
victors
have
forced
a
peace
which
practically
amounts
to
a
continuation
of
the
war
the
vanquished
have
had
to
give
up
their
colonies
their
shipping
their
credits
abroad
and
their
transferable
resources
besides
agreeing
to
the
military
and
economic
control
of
the
allies
moreover
despite
their
desperate
conditions
they
are
expected
to
pay
an
indemnity
the
amount
of
which
although
hitherto
only
vaguely
mentioned
surpasses
by
its
very
absurdity
all
possibility
of
an
even
remote
settlement
fourthly
considerable
groups
of
peoples
chiefly
germans
and
magyars
have
been
assigned
to
populations
of
an
inferior
civilization
fifthly
as
a
result
of
this
state
of
things
while
germany
austria
and
bulgaria
have
practically
no
army
at
all
and
have
submitted
without
the
slightest
resistance
to
the
most
stringent
forms
of
military
control
the
victorious
states
have
increased
their
armies
and
fleets
to
proportions
which
they
did
not
possess
before
the
war
sixthly
europe
cut
up
into
thirty
states
daily
sees
her
buying
capacity
decreasing
and
the
rate
of
exchange
rising
menacingly
against
her
seventhly
the
peace
treaties
are
the
most
barefaced
denial
of
all
the
principles
which
the
entente
powers
declared
and
proclaimed
during
the
war
not
only
so
but
they
are
a
fundamental
negation
of
president
wilson
famous
fourteen
points
which
were
supposed
to
constitute
a
solemn
pledge
and
covenant
not
only
with
the
enemy
but
with
the
democracies
of
the
whole
world
eighthly
the
moral
unrest
deriving
from
these
conditions
has
divided
among
themselves
the
various
entente
powers
united
states
of
america
great
britain
italy
and
france
not
only
in
their
aims
and
policy
but
in
their
sentiments
the
united
states
is
anxious
to
get
rid
as
far
as
possible
of
european
complications
and
responsibilities
france
follows
methods
with
which
great
britain
and
italy
are
not
wholly
in
sympathy
and
it
can
not
be
said
that
the
three
great
powers
of
western
europe
are
in
perfect
harmony
there
is
still
a
great
deal
of
talk
about
common
ends
and
ideals
and
the
necessity
of
applying
the
treaties
in
perfect
accord
and
harmony
but
everybody
is
convinced
that
to
enforce
the
treaties
without
attenuating
or
modifying
their
terms
would
mean
the
ruin
of
europe
and
the
collapse
of
the
victors
after
that
of
the
vanquished
ninthly
a
keen
contest
of
nationalisms
and
cornering
of
raw
materials
renders
friendly
relations
between
the
thirty
states
of
europe
extremely
difficult
the
most
characteristic
examples
of
nationalist
violence
have
arisen
out
of
the
war
as
in
the
case
of
poland
and
other
newborn
states
which
pursue
vain
dreams
of
empire
while
on
the
verge
of
dissolution
through
sheer
lack
of
vital
strength
and
energy
and
becoming
every
day
more
deeply
engulfed
in
misery
and
ruin
finally
continental
europe
is
on
the
eve
of
a
series
of
fresh
and
more
violent
wars
among
peoples
threatening
to
submerge
civilization
unless
some
means
be
found
to
replace
the
present
treaties
which
are
based
on
the
principle
that
it
is
necessary
to
continue
the
war
by
a
system
of
friendly
agreements
whereby
winners
and
losers
are
placed
on
a
footing
of
liberty
and
equality
and
which
while
laying
on
the
vanquished
a
weight
they
are
able
to
bear
will
liberate
europe
from
the
present
spectacle
of
a
continent
divided
into
two
camps
where
one
is
armed
to
the
teeth
and
threatening
while
the
other
unarmed
and
inoffensive
is
forced
to
labour
in
slavish
conditions
under
the
menace
of
a
servitude
even
more
severe
ii
the
peace
treaties
and
the
continuation
of
the
war
the
various
peace
treaties
regulating
the
present
territorial
situation
bear
the
names
of
the
localities
near
paris
in
which
they
were
signed
versailles
trianon
and
s√®vres
the
first
deals
with
germany
the
second
with
austria
the
third
with
hungary
and
the
fourth
with
turkey
the
treaty
of
neuilly
comparatively
far
less
important
concerns
bulgaria
alone
but
the
one
fundamental
and
decisive
treaty
is
the
treaty
of
versailles
inasmuch
as
it
not
only
establishes
as
a
recognized
fact
the
partition
of
europe
but
lays
down
the
rules
according
to
which
all
future
treaties
are
to
be
concluded
history
has
not
on
record
a
more
colossal
diplomatic
feat
than
this
treaty
by
which
europe
has
been
neatly
divided
into
two
sections
victors
and
vanquished
the
former
being
authorized
to
exercise
on
the
latter
complete
control
until
the
fulfilment
of
terms
which
even
at
an
optimistic
point
valuation
would
require
at
least
thirty
years
to
materialize
although
it
is
a
matter
of
recent
history
we
may
as
well
call
to
mind
that
the
entente
powers
have
always
maintained
that
the
war
was
wanted
and
was
imposed
by
germany
that
she
alone
with
her
allies
repeatedly
violated
the
rights
of
peoples
that
the
world
war
could
well
be
regarded
as
the
last
war
inasmuch
as
the
triumph
of
the
entente
meant
the
triumph
of
democracy
and
a
more
human
regime
of
life
a
society
of
nations
rich
in
effects
conducive
to
a
lasting
peace
it
was
imperative
to
restore
the
principles
of
international
justice
in
france
in
england
in
italy
and
later
even
more
solemnly
in
the
united
states
the
same
principles
have
been
proclaimed
by
heads
of
states
by
parliaments
and
governments
there
are
two
documents
laying
down
and
fixing
the
principles
which
the
entente
powers
on
the
eve
of
that
event
of
decisive
importance
the
entry
of
the
united
states
into
the
war
bound
themselves
to
sustain
and
to
carry
on
to
triumph
the
first
is
a
statement
by
briand
to
the
united
states
ambassador
in
the
name
of
all
the
other
allies
dated
december
briand
speaks
in
the
name
of
all
gouvernements
alli√©s
unis
pour
la
d√©fense
et
la
libert√©
des
briand
second
declaration
dated
january
is
even
more
fundamentally
important
it
is
a
collective
note
of
reply
to
president
wilson
delivered
in
the
name
of
all
the
allies
to
the
united
states
ambassador
the
principles
therein
established
are
very
clearly
enunciated
according
to
that
document
the
entente
has
no
idea
of
conquest
and
proposes
mainly
to
achieve
the
following
objects
restoration
of
belgium
serbia
and
montenegro
with
the
indemnities
due
to
them
evacuation
of
invaded
territories
in
france
russia
and
rumania
and
payment
of
just
reparations
reorganization
of
europe
with
a
permanent
regime
based
on
the
respect
of
nationalities
and
on
the
right
of
all
countries
both
great
and
small
to
complete
security
and
freedom
of
economic
development
besides
territorial
conventions
and
international
regulations
capable
of
guaranteeing
land
and
sea
frontiers
from
unjustified
attacks
restitution
of
the
provinces
and
territories
taken
in
the
past
from
the
allies
by
force
and
against
the
wish
of
the
inhabitants
liberation
of
italians
slavs
rumanians
and
from
foreign
rule
liberation
of
the
peoples
subjected
to
the
tyranny
of
the
turks
and
expulsion
from
europe
of
the
ottoman
empire
as
being
decidedly
extraneous
to
western
civilization
the
intentions
of
his
majesty
the
emperor
of
russia
in
regard
to
poland
are
clearly
indicated
in
the
proclamation
addressed
to
his
armies
the
allies
have
never
harboured
the
design
of
exterminating
german
peoples
nor
of
bringing
about
their
political
disappearance
at
that
time
the
autocratic
form
of
government
still
prevailed
in
russia
and
the
allies
still
considered
themselves
bound
to
aspirations
moreover
there
existed
in
regard
to
italy
the
obligations
established
by
the
pact
of
london
that
is
why
in
the
statements
of
the
entente
powers
of
europe
the
restoration
of
montenegro
is
regarded
as
an
obligation
mention
is
made
of
the
necessity
of
driving
the
turks
out
of
europe
in
order
to
enable
russia
to
seize
constantinople
and
as
to
poland
there
are
only
vague
allusions
namely
the
reference
made
to
the
tsar
intentions
as
outlined
in
his
proclamation
the
entente
has
won
the
war
but
russia
has
collapsed
under
the
strain
had
victory
been
achieved
without
the
fall
of
russia
the
latter
would
have
installed
herself
as
the
predominating
power
in
the
mediterranean
on
the
other
hand
to
unite
dalmatia
to
italy
while
separating
her
from
italy
according
to
the
pact
of
london
by
assigning
the
territory
of
fiume
to
croatia
would
have
meant
setting
all
the
forces
of
slav
irredentism
against
italy
these
considerations
are
of
no
practical
value
inasmuch
as
events
have
taken
another
course
nobody
can
say
what
would
have
happened
if
the
carthagenians
had
conquered
the
romans
or
if
victory
had
remained
with
mithridates
hypotheses
are
of
but
slight
interest
when
truth
follows
another
direction
nevertheless
we
can
not
but
repeat
that
it
was
a
great
fortune
for
europe
that
victory
was
not
decided
by
russia
and
that
the
decisive
factor
proved
the
united
states
it
is
beyond
all
possible
doubt
that
without
the
intervention
of
the
united
states
of
america
the
war
could
not
have
been
won
by
the
entente
although
the
admission
may
prove
humiliating
to
the
european
point
of
view
it
is
a
fact
which
can
not
be
attenuated
or
disguised
the
united
states
threw
into
the
balance
the
weight
of
its
enormous
economic
and
technical
resources
besides
its
enormous
resources
in
men
although
its
dead
only
amount
to
fifty
thousand
the
united
states
built
up
such
a
formidable
human
reserve
as
to
deprive
germany
of
all
hopes
of
victory
the
announcement
of
america
entry
in
the
war
immediately
crushed
all
germany
power
of
resistance
germany
felt
that
the
struggle
was
no
longer
limited
to
europe
and
that
every
effort
was
vain
the
united
states
besides
giving
to
the
war
enormous
quantities
of
arms
and
money
had
practically
inexhaustible
reserves
of
men
to
place
in
the
field
against
an
enemy
already
exhausted
and
war
and
battles
are
two
very
different
things
battles
constitute
an
essentially
military
fact
while
war
is
an
essentially
political
fact
that
explains
why
great
leaders
in
war
have
always
been
first
and
foremost
great
political
leaders
namely
men
accustomed
to
manage
other
men
and
able
to
utilize
them
for
their
purposes
alexander
julius
caesar
napoleon
the
three
greatest
military
leaders
produced
by
aryan
civilization
were
essentially
political
men
war
is
not
only
a
clash
of
arms
it
is
above
all
the
most
convenient
exploitation
of
men
of
economic
resources
and
of
political
situations
a
battle
is
a
fact
of
a
purely
military
nature
the
romans
almost
constantly
placed
at
the
head
of
their
armies
personages
of
consular
rank
who
regarded
and
conducted
the
war
as
a
political
enterprise
the
rules
of
tactics
and
strategy
are
perfectly
useless
if
those
who
conduct
the
war
fail
to
utilize
to
the
utmost
all
the
means
at
their
disposal
it
can
not
be
denied
that
in
the
war
germany
and
scored
the
greatest
number
of
victories
for
a
long
period
they
succeeded
in
invading
large
tracts
of
enemy
territory
and
in
recovering
those
parts
of
their
own
territory
which
had
been
invaded
besides
always
maintaining
the
offensive
they
won
great
battles
at
the
cost
of
enormous
sacrifices
in
men
and
lives
and
for
a
long
time
victory
appeared
to
shine
on
their
arms
but
they
failed
to
understand
that
from
the
day
in
which
the
violation
of
belgium
neutrality
determined
great
britain
entry
in
the
field
the
war
from
a
general
point
of
view
could
be
regarded
as
lost
as
i
have
said
germany
is
especially
lacking
in
political
sense
after
bismarck
her
statesmen
have
never
risen
to
the
height
of
the
situation
even
von
b√ºlow
who
appeared
to
be
one
of
the
cleverest
never
had
a
single
manifestation
of
real
intelligence
the
banal
statements
made
about
belgium
and
the
united
states
of
america
by
the
men
who
directed
germany
war
policy
were
precisely
the
sort
of
thing
most
calculated
to
harm
the
people
from
whom
they
came
what
is
decidedly
lacking
in
germany
while
it
abounds
in
france
is
a
political
class
now
a
political
class
consisting
of
men
of
ability
and
culture
can
not
but
be
the
result
of
a
democratic
education
in
all
modern
states
especially
in
those
which
have
achieved
a
high
standard
of
civilization
and
development
it
seems
almost
incredible
that
germany
despite
all
her
culture
should
have
tolerated
the
political
dictatorship
of
the
kaiser
and
of
his
accomplices
at
the
conferences
of
paris
and
london
in
and
i
did
all
that
was
in
my
power
to
prevent
the
trial
of
the
kaiser
and
i
am
convinced
that
my
firm
attitude
in
the
matter
succeeded
in
avoiding
it
sound
common
sense
saved
us
from
floundering
in
one
of
the
most
formidable
blunders
of
the
treaty
of
versailles
to
hold
one
man
responsible
for
the
whole
war
and
to
bring
him
to
trial
his
enemies
acting
as
judge
and
jury
would
have
been
such
a
monstrous
travesty
of
justice
as
to
provoke
a
moral
revolt
throughout
the
world
on
the
other
hand
it
was
also
a
moral
monstrosity
which
would
have
deprived
the
treaty
of
versailles
of
every
shred
of
dignity
if
the
one
responsible
for
the
war
is
the
kaiser
why
does
the
entente
demand
of
the
german
people
such
enormous
indemnities
unprecedented
in
history
one
of
the
men
who
has
exercised
the
greatest
influence
on
european
events
during
the
last
ten
years
one
of
the
most
intelligent
of
living
statesmen
once
told
me
that
it
was
his
opinion
that
the
kaiser
did
not
want
the
war
but
neither
did
he
wish
to
prevent
it
germany
although
under
protest
has
been
forced
to
accept
the
statement
of
the
versailles
treaty
to
the
effect
that
she
is
responsible
for
the
war
and
that
she
provoked
it
the
same
charge
has
been
levelled
at
her
in
all
the
entente
states
throughout
the
war
when
our
countries
were
engaged
in
the
struggle
and
we
were
at
grips
with
a
dangerous
enemy
it
was
our
duty
to
keep
up
the
of
our
people
and
to
paint
our
adversaries
in
the
darkest
colours
laying
on
their
shoulders
all
the
blame
and
responsibility
of
the
war
but
after
the
great
world
conflict
now
that
imperial
germany
has
fallen
it
would
be
absurd
to
maintain
that
the
responsibility
of
the
war
is
solely
and
wholly
attributable
to
germany
and
that
earlier
than
in
europe
there
had
not
developed
a
state
of
things
fatally
destined
to
culminate
in
a
war
if
germany
has
the
greatest
responsibility
that
responsibility
is
shared
more
or
less
by
all
the
countries
of
the
entente
but
while
the
entente
countries
in
spite
of
their
mistakes
had
the
political
sense
always
to
invoke
principles
of
right
and
justice
the
statesmen
of
germany
gave
utterance
to
nothing
but
brutal
and
vulgar
statements
culminating
in
the
deplorable
mental
and
moral
expressions
contained
in
the
speeches
messages
and
telegrams
of
william
ii
he
was
a
perfect
type
of
the
not
a
harmless
but
an
irritating
and
dangerous
boaster
who
succeeded
in
piling
up
more
loathing
and
hatred
against
his
country
than
the
most
active
and
intelligently
managed
enemy
propaganda
could
possibly
have
done
if
the
issue
of
the
war
could
be
regarded
as
seriously
jeopardized
by
england
intervention
it
was
practically
lost
for
the
central
empires
when
the
united
states
stepped
in
america
decision
definitely
crippled
germany
resistance
and
not
only
for
military
but
for
moral
reasons
in
all
his
messages
president
wilson
had
repeatedly
declared
that
he
wanted
a
peace
based
on
justice
and
equity
of
which
he
outlined
the
fundamental
conditions
moreover
he
stated
that
he
had
no
quarrel
with
the
germans
themselves
but
with
the
men
who
were
at
their
head
and
that
he
did
not
wish
to
impose
on
the
vanquished
peace
terms
such
as
might
savour
of
oppression
president
wilson
ideas
on
the
subject
have
been
embodied
in
a
bulky
volume
turning
over
the
pages
of
this
book
now
we
have
the
impression
that
it
is
a
collection
of
literary
essays
by
a
man
who
had
his
eye
on
posterity
and
assumed
a
pose
most
likely
to
attract
the
admiration
of
generations
as
yet
unborn
but
when
these
same
words
were
uttered
in
the
intervals
of
mighty
battles
they
fell
on
expectant
and
anxious
ears
they
were
regarded
as
a
ray
of
light
in
the
fearsome
darkness
of
uncertainty
and
everybody
listened
to
them
not
only
because
the
president
was
the
authorized
exponent
of
a
great
nation
of
a
powerful
people
but
because
he
represented
an
inexhaustible
source
of
vitality
in
the
midst
of
the
ravages
of
violence
and
death
president
wilson
messages
have
done
as
much
as
famine
and
cruel
losses
in
the
field
to
break
the
stubborn
resistance
of
the
german
people
if
it
was
possible
to
obtain
a
just
peace
why
go
to
the
bitter
end
when
defeat
was
manifestly
inevitable
obstinacy
is
the
backbone
of
war
and
nothing
undermines
a
nation
power
of
resistance
so
much
as
doubt

also

president

words
pronounced
as
a
solemn
pledge
before
the
whole

had
a
most
powerful
effect
on
all
classes

greatly
contributed
towards

while
reactionaries
welcomed
any
way
out
of
their
disastrous
adventure
after

entry
in

president

on

formulated
the
fourteen
points
of
his
programme
regarding
the
finalities
of
the

and
the
peace
to
be
realized
it
is
here
necessary
to
reproduce
the
original
text
of
president
wilson
message
containing
the
fourteen
points
which
constitute
a
formal
pledge
undertaken
by
the
democracy
of
america
not
only
towards
enemy
peoples
but
towards
all
peoples
of
the
world
these
important
statements
from
president
wilson
message
have
strangely
enough
been
reproduced
either
incompletely
or
in
an
utterly
mistaken
form
even
in
official
documents
and
in
books
published
by
statesmen
who
took
a
leading
part
in
the
paris
conference
it
is
therefore
advisable
to
reproduce
the
original
text
in
full
honest
peace
treaties
following
loyal
and
honest
negotiations
after
which
secret
international
agreements
will
be
abolished
and
diplomacy
will
always
proceed
frankly
and
openly
full
liberty
of
navigation
on
the

rigorous
observance
of
the
principle
that
in
the
determination
of
all
questions
of
sovereignty
the
interests
of
the
populations
shall
bear
equal
weight
with
those
of
the
government
whose
claims
are
to
be
determined
the
evacuation
of
all
russian
territories
and
a
settlement
of
all
russian
questions
such
as
to
ensure
the
best
and
most
untrammelled
of
other
nations
of
the
world
in
order
to
afford
russia
a
clear
and
precise
opportunity
for
the
independent
settlement
of
her
autonomous
political
development
and
of
her
national
policy
promising
her
a
cordial
welcome
in
the
league
of
nations
under
institutions
of
her
own
choice
and
besides
a
cordial
welcome
help
and
assistance
in
all
that
she
may
need
and
require
the
treatment
meted
out
to
russia
by
the
sister
nations
in
the
months
to
come
must
be
a
decisive
proof
of
their
goodwill
of
their
understanding
of
her
needs
as
apart
from
their
own
interests
and
of
their
intelligent
and
disinterested
sympathy
belgium
as
the
whole
world
will
agree
must
be
evacuated
and
reconstructed
without
the
slightest
attempt
at
curtailing
the
sovereign
rights
which
she
enjoys
in
common
with
other
free
nations
nothing
will
be
more
conducive
to
the
of
confidence
and
respect
among
nations
for
those
laws
which
they
themselves
have
made
for
the
regulation
and
observance
of
their
reciprocal
relations
without
this
salutary
measure
the
whole
structure
and
validity
of
international
law
would
be
permanently
undermined
all
french
territories
will
be
liberated
the
invaded
regions
reconstructed
and
the
wrong
done
to
france
by
prussia
in
in
the
question
of

which
has

the
peace
of
the
world
for
nearly
half
a
century
must
be
made
good
so
as
to
ensure
a
lasting
peace
in
the
general
interest
the
italian
frontier
must
be
rectified
on
the
basis
of
the
clearly
recognized
lines
of
nationality
the
people
of
whose
place
among
the
nations
we
wish
to
see
safeguarded
and
maintained
should
come
to
an
agreement
as
to
the
best
way
of
attaining
their
autonomous
development
rumania
serbia
and
montenegro
are
to
be
evacuated
and
occupied
territories
restored

mutual
relations
between
the
balkan
states
to
be
determined
on
a
friendly
basis
by
a
council
following
the
lines
of
friendship
and
nationality
traced
by
tradition
and
history
the
political
and
economic
integrity
of
the
various
balkan
states
to
be
guaranteed
a
certain
degree
of
sovereignty
must
be
assigned
to
that
part
of
the
ottoman
empire
which
is
turkish
but
the
other
nationalities
now
under
the
turkish
regime
should
have
the
assurance
of
an
independent
existence
and
of
an
absolute
and
undisturbed
opportunity
to
develop
their
autonomy
moreover
the
dardanelles
should
be
permanently
open
to
the
shipping
and
commerce
of
all
nations
under
international
guarantees
an
independent
polish
state
should
be
founded
comprising
all
territories
inhabited
by
peoples
of
undoubtedly
polish
nationality
with
a
free
and
secure
access
to
the
sea
and
its
political
and
economic
independence
and
territorial
integrity
guaranteed
by
international
agreements
a
league
of
nations
must
be
formed
with
special
pacts
and
for
the
sole
scope
of
ensuring
the
reciprocal
guarantees
of
political
independence
and
of
territorial
integrity
in
equal
measure
both
for
large
and
small
states
the
peace
treaty
as
outlined
by
wilson
would
really
have
brought
about
a
just
peace
but
we
shall
see
how
the
actual
result
proved
quite
the
reverse
of
what
constituted
a
solemn
pledge
of
the
american
people
and
of
the
entente
powers
on
february
president
wilson
confirmed
before
congress
that
all
territorial
readjustments
were
to
be
made
in
the
interest
and
for
the
advantage
of
the
populations
concerned
not
merely
as
a
bargain
between
rival
states
and
that
there
were
not
to
be
indemnities
annexations
or
punitive
exactions
of
any
kind
on
september
just
on
the
eve
of
the
armistice
when
german
resistance
was
already
shaken
almost
to
breaking
point
president
wilson
gave
it
the
de
by
his
message
on
the
economic
settlement
no
special
or
separate
interest
of
any
single
nation
or
group
of
nations
was
to
be
taken
as
the
basis
of
any
settlement
which
did
not
concern
the
common
interest
of
all
there
were
not
to
be
any
leagues
or
alliances
or
special
pacts
or
ententes
within
the
great
family
of
the
society
of
nations
economic
deals
and
corners
of
an
egotistical
nature
were
to
be
forbidden
as
also
all
forms
of
boycotting
with
the
exception
of
those
applied
in
punishment
to
the
countries
transgressing
the
rules
of
good
fellowship
all
international
treaties
and
agreements
of
every
kind
were
to
be
published
in
their
entirety
to
the
whole
world
it
was
a
magnificent
programme
of
world
policy
not
only
would
it
have
meant
peace
after
war
but
a
peace
calculated
to
heal
the
deep
wounds
of
europe
and
to
renovate
the
economic
status
of
nations
on
the
basis
of
these
principles
which
constituted
a
solemn
pledge
germany
worn
out
by
famine
and
even
more
by
increasing
internal
unrest
demanded
peace
according
to
president
wilson
clear
statements
made
not
only
in
the
name
of
the
united
states
but
in
that
of
the
whole
entente
peace
should
therefore
have
been
based
on
justice
the
relations
between
winners
and
losers
in
a
society
of
nations
being
exclusively
inspired
by
mutual
trust
there
were
no
longer
to
be
huge
standing
armies
neither
on
the
part
of
the
empires
or
on
that
of
the
victorious
states
adequate

were
to
be

the
reduction
of

to
the
minimum
necessary
for
internal

economic
barriers
absolute

as
to

of
the
vanquished
besides
evacuating
the
occupied
territories
they
were
to
reconstruct
belgium
to
restore
to
france
the
territories
taken
in
to
restore
all
the
territories
belonging
to
rumania
serbia
and
montenegro

serbia
a

constitute
a

poland
founded
on

ethnical
bases
far
from
being
a
military
state
was
to
be
an
element
of
peace
and
her
political
and
economic
independence
and
territorial
integrity
were
to
have
been
guaranteed
by
an
international
agreement
after
the
rectification
of
the
italian
frontier
according
to
the
principles
of
nationality
the
peoples
of
were
to
agree
on
the
free
opportunity
of
their
autonomous
development
in
other
terms
each
people
could
freely
choose
autonomy
or
throw
in
its
lot
with
some
other
state
after
giving
a
certain
sovereignty
to
the
turkish
populations
of
the
ottoman
empire
the
other
nationalities
were
to
be
allowed
to
develop
autonomously
and
the
free
navigation
of
the
dardanelles
was
to
be
internationally
guaranteed
these
principles
announced
by
president
wilson
and
already
proclaimed
in
part
by
the
entente
powers
when
they
stoutly
affirmed
that
they
were
fighting
for
right
for
democracy
and
for
peace
did
not
constitute
a
concession
but
a
duty
towards
the
enemy
in
each
of
the
losing
countries
in
germany
as
in
the
democratic
groups
contrary
to
the
war
and
those
even
more
numerous
which
had
accepted
the
war
as
in
a
momentary
intoxication
when
they
exerted
themselves
for
the
triumph
of
peace
had
counted
on
the
statements
or
rather
on
the
solemn
promises
which
american
democracy
had
made
not
only
in
the
name
of
the
united
states
but
in
that
of
all
the
entente
powers
let
us
now
try
to
sum
up
the
terms
imposed
on
germany
and
the
other
losing
countries
by
the
treaty
of
june
the
treaty
it
is
true
was
concluded
between
the
allied
and
associated
countries
and
germany
but
it
also
concerns
the
very
existence
of
other
countries
such
as
russia
etc
territorial
and
political
clauses
until
the
payment
of
an
indemnity
the
amount
of
which
is
as
yet
not
definitely
stated
germany
loses
the
fundamental
characters
of
a
sovereign
state
not
only
part
of
her
territory
remains
under
the
occupation
of
the
troops
for
a
period
of
fifteen
years
but
a
whole
series
of
controls
is
established
military
administrative
on
transports
etc
the
commission
for
reparations
is
empowered
to
effect
all
the
changes
it
thinks
fit
in
the
laws
and
regulations
of
the
german
state
besides
applying
sanctions
of
a
military
and
economic
nature
in
the
event
of
violations
of
the
clauses
placed
under
its
control
art
the
allied
and
associated
governments
declare
and
germany
recognizes
that
germany
and
her
allies
are
solely
responsible
being
the
direct
cause
thereof
for
all
the
losses
and
damages
suffered
by
the

their
subjects

a
result
of
the
war
which
was
thrust
upon
them
by
the
aggression
of
germany
and
her
allies
art
consequently
the
resources
of
germany
and
by
the
other
treaties
those
of
her
allies
as
well
are
destined
even
if
insufficient
to
ensure
full
reparation
for
all
losses
and
damages

allied
and

these

have

the

lines
of

of

the

far
less
important
inasmuch
as
the

was

well
defined

as
regards
territorial
questions
by
the
treaty
of
versailles
are
cast
in
the
same
mould
and
contain
no
essential
variation
now
these
treaties
constitute
an
absolutely
new
fact
and
no
one
can
affirm
that
the
treaty
of
versailles
derives
even
remotely
from
the
declarations
of
the
entente
and
from
wilson
solemn
pledges
uttered
in
the
name
of
those
who
took
part
in
the
war
if
the
terms
of
the
armistice
were
deeply
in
contrast
with
the
pledges
to
which
the
entente
powers
had
bound
themselves
before
the
whole
world
the
treaty
of
versailles
and
the
other
treaties
deriving
therefrom
are
a
deliberate
negation
of
all
that
had
been
promised
amounting
to
a
debt
of
honour
and
which
had
contributed
much
more
powerfully
towards
the
defeat
of
the
enemy
than
the
entry
in
the
field
of
many
fresh
divisions
in
the
state
of
extreme
exhaustion
in
which
both
conquerors
and
losers
found
themselves
in
in
the
terrible
suffering
of
the
germanic
group
of
belligerents
deprived
for
four
years
of
sufficient
nourishment
and
of
the
most
elementary
necessaries
of
life
in
the
moral
collapse
which
had
taken
the
place
of
boasting
and
temerity
the
words
of
wilson
who
pledged
himself
to
a
just
peace
and
established
its
terms
proclaiming
them
to
the
world
had
completely
broken
down
whatever
force
of
resistance
there
still
remained
they
were
the
most
powerful
instruments
of
victory
and
if
not
the
essential
cause
certainly
not
the
least
important
among
the
causes
which
brought
about
the
collapse
of
the
central
empires
germany
had
been
deeply
hit
by
the
armistice
obliged
to
hand
over
immediately
locomotives
and
railway
trucks
and
carriages
at
the
very
time
when
she
had
to
demobilize
during
the
first
months
she
found
her
traffic
almost
completely
paralysed
every
war
brings
virulent
germs
of
revolution
in
the
vanquished
countries
the
war
of
gave
france
the
impulsive
manifestations
of
in
exactly
the
same
manner
as
war
gave
rise
in
germany
during
the
first
months
after
the
armistice
to
a
violent
revolutionary
crisis
overcome
not
without
difficulty
and
still
representing
a
grave
menace
forced
to
surrender
immediately
a
large
quantity
of
live
stock
to
demobilize
when
the
best
part
of
her
railway
material
had
gone
still
hampered
by
the
blockade
germany
against
the
interest
of
the
allies
themselves
has
been
obliged
to
sacrifice
her
exchange
because
in
the
absence
of
sufficient
help
she
has
had
to
buy
the
most
indispensable
foodstuffs
in
neutral
countries
her
paper
currency
which
at
the
end
of
amounted
to
milliard
marks
not
excessive
as
compared
with
that
of
other
countries
immediately
increased
with
a
growing
crescendo
till
it
reached
in
a
very
short
time
the
figure
of
milliards
thus
rendering
from
the
very
first
the
payment
of
indemnities
in
gold
extremely
difficult
the
most
skilled
men
have
been
thrust
into
an
absolute
impossibility
of
producing
to
have
deprived
germany
of
her
merchant
fleet
built
up
with
so
much
care
means
to
have
deprived
the
freight
market
of
sixty
thousand
of
the
most
skilled
intelligent
and
seamen
but
what
germany
has
lost
as
a
result
of
the
treaty
surpasses
all
imagination
and
can
only
be
regarded
as
a
sentence
of
ruin
and
decay
voluntarily
passed
over
a
whole
people
germany
without
taking
into
account
the
countries
subject
to
plebiscite
has
lost
per
cent
of
her
population
should
the
plebiscites
prove
unfavourable
to
her
or
as
the
tendency
seems
to
be
should
these
plebiscites
be
disregarded
germany
would
lose
per
cent
of
her
population
purely
german
territories
have
been
forcibly
wrenched
from
her
what
has
been
done
in
the
case
of
the
saar
has
no
precedents
in
modern
history
it
is
a
country
of
inhabitants
of
whom
not
even
one
hundred
are
french
a
country
which
has
been
german
for
a
thousand
years
and
which
was
temporarily
occupied
by
france
for
purely
military
reasons
in
spite
of
these
facts
however
not
only
have
the
coal
fields
of
the
saar
been
assigned
in
perpetuity
to
france
as
compensation
for
the
damages
caused
to
the
french
mines
in
the
north
but
the
territory
of
the
saar
forms
part
of
the
french
customs
regime
and
will
be
subjected
after
fifteen
years
to
a
plebiscite
when
such
a
necessity
is
absolutely
incomprehensible
as
the
population
is
purely
german
and
has
never
in
any
form
or
manner
expressed
the
intention
of
changing
its
nationality
the
ebb
and
flow
of
peoples
in
europe
during
the
long
war
of
nationalities
has
often
changed
the
situation
of
frontier
countries
sometimes
it
may
still
be
regarded
as
a
necessity
to
include
small
groups
of
alien
race
and
language
in
different
states
in
order
to
ensure
strategically
safe
frontiers
but
with
the
exception
of
the
necessity
for
there
is
nothing
to
justify
what
has
been
done
to
the
detriment
of
germany
wilson
had
only
said
that
france
should
receive
compensation
for
the
wrong
suffered
in
and
that
belgium
should
be
evacuated
and
reconstructed
what
had
been
destroyed
was
to
have
been
built
up
again
but
no
one
had
ever
thought
during
the
war
of
handing
over
to
belgium
a
part
however
small
of
german
territory
or
of
surrendering
predominantly
and
purely
german
territories
to
poland
the
german
colonies
covered
an
area
of
nearly
square
kilometres
they
had
reached
an
admirable
degree
of
development
and
were
managed
with
the
greatest
skill
and
ability
they
represented
an
enormous
value
nevertheless
they
have
been
assigned
to
france
great
britain
and
in
minor
proportion
to
japan
without
figuring
at
all
in
the
reparations
account
it
is
calculated
that
as
a
result
of
the
treaty
owing
to
the
loss
of
a
considerable
percentage
of
her
agricultural
area
germany
is
per
cent
the
poorer
in
regard
to
the
production
of
cereals
and
potatoes
and
ten
to
twelve
per
cent
in
regard
to
the
breeding
of
live
stock
the
restitution
of
the
only
formal
claim
advanced
by
the
entente
in
its
war
programme
has
deprived
germany
of
the
bulk
of
her
production
in
germany
could
count
on
tons
of
iron
from
lorraine
from
luxemburg
from
upper
silesia
and
from
the
rest
of
her
territory
this
means
that
germany
is
reduced
to
only
per
cent
of
her
wealth
in
iron
ore
in
the
saar
district
represented
per
cent
of
the
total
production
of
coal
and
upper
silesia
per
cent
having
lost
about
eighty
per
cent
of
her
iron
ore
and
large
stocks
of
coal
while
her
production
is
severely
handicapped
germany
completely
disorganized
abroad
after
the
suppression
of
all
economic
equilibrium
is
condemned
to
look
on
helplessly
while
the
very
sources
of
her
national
wealth
dry
up
and
cease
to
flow
in
order
to
form
a
correct
estimate
of
the
facts
we
must
hold
in
mind
that
of
germany
total
exports
before
the
war
consisted
of
iron
and
of
tools
and
machinery
mostly
manufactured
with
german
iron
if
we
now
consider
the
fourteen
points
of
president
wilson
accepted
by
the
entente
as
a
peace
programme
comparing
the
actual
results
obtained
by
the
treaty
of
versailles
we
are
faced
with
the
following
situation
loyal
peace
negotiations
and
the
conclusion
and
signing
of
peace
treaties
secret
diplomatic
agreements
must
be
regarded
as
says
wilson
on
the
contrary
secret
peace
negotiations
have
been
protracted
for
more
than
six
months
and
no
hearing
was
even
granted
to
the
german
delegates
who
wished
to
expose
their
views
by
a
system
of
treaties
france
has
created
a
military
alliance
with
belgium
and
poland
thus
completely
cornering
germany
freedom
of
the
sea
beyond
territorial
nothing
as
a
matter
of
fact
has
been
changed
from
the
state
of
things
with
the
difference
that
the
losers
have
had
to
surrender
their
mercantile
fleets
and
are
therefore
no
longer
directly
interested
in
the
question
of
all
economic
barriers
and
equality
of
trade
the
treaty
imposes
on
germany
terms
without
reciprocity
and
almost
all
entente
countries
have
already
adopted
protectionist
and
prohibitive
tariffs
guarantees
to
be
given
and
received
for
the
reduction
of
armaments
to
a
minimum
compatible
with
home
the
treaties
have
compelled
the
vanquished
countries
to
destroy
or
to
surrender
their
navies
and
have
reduced
the
standing
armies
of
germany
to
men
including
officers
of
bulgaria
to
of
austria

in
reality
only
of

superior
to
those
which
they
had
before
the

belgium
and
poland
have
between
them
about

the

germany
austria

has

on
the

them
more
than

and
wrangel
all

has
been
done

to
belgium
have
been
assigned
territories
which
she
never
dreamt
of
claiming
before

french
territories
reconstruction
of
invaded
regions
and
restitution
of
to
france
in
respect
of
the
territories
taken
from
her
in
france
occupies
a
dominating
position
in
the
saar
which
constitutes
an
absolute
denial
of
the
principle
of
nationality
of
the
italian
frontier
according
to
clearly
defined
lines
of
as
these
lines
have
never
been
clearly
defined
or
recognized
the
solution
arrived
at
has
been
distasteful
both
to
the
italians
and
to
their
neighbours

of
to
be
left
free
to
unite
together
or
to
form
autonomous
states
in
the
manner
best
suited
to
their
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
treaties
have
taken
the
greatest
possible
number
of
germans
from
austria
and
of
magyars
from
hungary
in
order
to
hand
them
over
to

to

to
namely
to

the
most
part
inferior
to
the

this
has
been
effected
but
whereas
the
entente
powers
have
always
proclaimed
their
fundamental
duty
for
the
reconstruction
of
montenegro
they
all
contributed

what
really
happened
was
that

powers
immediately
tried
to
possess
themselves
of
asia

but
events
rendered
it
necessary
to
adopt
a
regime
of

to
be
founded
as
a
neutral
state
with
a
free
and
secure
outlet
to
the
sea
and
whose
integrity
is
to
be
guaranteed
by
international
in
reality
a
polish
state
has
been
formed
with
populations
undoubtedly
having
a
markedly
military
character
and
aiming
at
further
expansion
in
ukranian
and
german
territory
it
has
a
population
of
inhabitants
while
it
should
not
exceed
and
proposes
to
isolate
russia
from
germany
moreover
the
free
state
of
danzig
practically
dependent
from
poland
constitutes
a
standing
menace
to
germany
of
the
league
of
nations
for
the
sole
purpose
of
order
among
nations
and
laying
the
basis
of
reciprocal
guarantees
of
territorial
integrity
and
political
independence
for
all
states
both
great
and
after
more
than
two
years
have
elapsed
since
the
conclusion
of
peace
and
three
since
the
armistice
the
league
of
nations
is
still
nothing
but
a
holy
alliance
the
object
of
which
is
to
guarantee
the
privileges
of
the
conquerors
after
the
vote
of
the
senate
deserving
of
all
praise
from
every
point
of
view
the
united
states
does
not
form
part
of
the
league
nor
do
the
losing
countries
including
germany
it
is
therefore
obvious
that
the
most
solemn
pledges
on
which
peace
was
based
have
not
been
maintained
the
noble
declarations
made
by
the
entente
during
the
war
have
been
forgotten
forgotten
all
the
solemn
collective
pledges
forgotten
and
disregarded
wilson
proclamations
which
without
being
real
contracts
or
treaties
were
something
far
more
solemn
and
binding
a
pledge
taken
before
the
whole
world
at
its
most
tragic
hour
to
give
the
enemy
a
guarantee
of
justice
without
expressing
any
opinion
on
the
treaties
it
can
not
be
denied
that
the
manner
in
which
they
have
been
applied
has
been
even
worse
for
the
first
time
in
civilized
europe
not
during
the
war
when
everything
was
permissible
in
the
supreme
interests
of
defence
but
now
that
the
war
is
over
the
entente
powers
though
maintaining
armies
more
numerous
than
ever
for
which
the
vanquished
must
pay
have
occupied
german
territories
inhabited
by
the
most
cultured
progressive
and
technically
advanced
populations
in
the
world
as
an
insult
and
a
slight
with
coloured
troops
men
from
darkest
and
most
barbarous
africa
to
act
as
defenders
of
the
rights
of
civilization
and
to
maintain
the
law
and
order
of
democracy
iii
the
peace
treaties
their
origin
and
aims
how
after
the
solemn
pledges
undertaken
during
the
war
a
peace
could
have
been
concluded
which
practically
negatives
all
the
principles
professed
during
the
war
and
all
the
obligations
entered
into
is
easily
explained
when
the
progress
of
events
is
noted
from
the
autumn
of
to
the
end
of
the
spring
of
i
took
no
direct
part
in
those
events
as
i
had
no
share
in
the
government
of
italy
from
january
to
the
end
of
june
the
period
during
which
the
treaties
of
versailles
and
were
being
prepared
the
orlando
ministry
was
resigning
when
the
treaty
of
versailles
was
drawn
up
for
signature
and
the
situation
which
confronted
the
ministry
of
which
i
was
head
was
clearly
defined
nevertheless
i
asked
the
minister
of
foreign
affairs
and
the
delegates
of
the
preceding
cabinet
to
put
their
signatures
to
it
signing
was
a
necessity
and
it
fell
to
me
later
on
to
put
my
signature
to
the
ratification
the
treaty
of
versailles
and
those
which
have
followed
with
austria
hungary
bulgaria
and
turkey
have
been
validly
signed
and
they
pledge
the
good
faith
of
the
countries
which
have
signed
them
but
in
the
application
of
them
there
is
need
of
great
breadth
of
view
there
is
need
of
dispassionate
study
to
see
if
they
can
be
maintained
if
the
fulfilment
of
the
impossible
or
unjust
conditions
demanded
of
the
conquered
countries
will
not
do
more
harm
to
the
conquerors
will
not
in
point
of
actual
fact
pave
the
way
to
their
ruin
if
there
is
one
thing
lloyd
george
has
said
which
will
never
be
forgotten
or
forgiven
it
is
arrogance
and
injustice
in
the
hour
of
triumph
we
have
never
tired
of
saying
that
germany
is
the
most
barbarous
among
civilized
countries
that
under
her
civilization
is
hidden
all
the
barbarism
of
mediaeval
times
that
she
puts
into
practice
the
doctrine
of
might
over
right
at
the
present
moment
it
is
our
duty
to
ask
ourselves
if
something
of
the
principles
which
we
have
for
so
long
been
attributing
to
germany
has
not
passed
over
to
the
other
side
if
in
our
own
hearts
there
is
not
a
bitterness
of
hatred
clouding
our
judgment
and
robbing
our
programme
of
all
action
that
can
do
real
good
prussia
won
the
war
against
in
and
did
not
ask
for
or
impose
any
really
onerous
terms
it
was
contented
with
having
regained
hegemony
among
the
german
people
prussia
conquered
france
in
it
was
an
unjust
war
and
prussia
laid
down
two
unjust
conditions
and
the
indemnity
of
five
milliards
as
soon
as
the
indemnity
was
paid
and
it
was
an
indemnity
that
could
be
paid
in
one
lump
sum
prussia
evacuated
the
occupied
territory
it
did
not
claim
of
france
its
colonies
or
its
fleet
it
did
not
impose
the
reduction
of
its
armaments
or
control
of
its
transport
after
the
peace
the
treaty
of
frankfort
is
a
humanitarian
act
compared
with
the
treaty
of
versailles
if
germany
had
won
the
war
germany
to
whom
we
have
always
attributed
the
worst
possible
intentions
what
could
it
have
done
that
the
entente
has
not
done
it
is
possible
that
as
it
is
gifted
with
more
practical
common
sense
it
might
have
laid
down
less
impossible
conditions
in
order
to
gain
a
secure
advantage
without
ruining
the
conquered
countries
there
are
about
ninety
millions
of
germans
in
europe
and
perhaps
fifteen
millions
in
different
countries
outside
europe
but
in
the
heart
of
europe
they
represent
a
great
ethnic
unity
they
are
the
largest
and
most
compact
national
group
in
that
continent
with
all
the
good
and
bad
points
of
their
race
too
methodical
and
at
the
same
time
easily
depressed
by
a
severe
setback
they
are
still
the
most
cultivated
people
on
earth
it
is
impossible
to
imagine
that
they
can
disappear
much
less
that
they
can
reconcile
themselves
to
live
in
a
condition
of
slavery
on
the
other
hand
the
entente
has
built
on
a
foundation
of
shifting
sand
a
europe
full
of
small
states
poisoned
with
imperialism
and
in
ruinous
conditions
of
economy
and
finance
and
a
too
great
poland
without
a
national
basis
and
necessarily
the
enemy
of
russia
and
of
germany
no
people
has
always
been
victorious
the
peoples
who
have
fought
most
wars
in
modern
europe
english
french
and
germans
have
had
alternate
victories
and
defeats
a
defeat
often
carries
in
its
train
reconsideration
which
is
followed
by
renewed
energy
the
greatness
of
england
is
largely
due
to
its
steadfast
determination
to
destroy
the
napoleonic
empire
what
elevates
men
is
this
steadfast
and
persevering
effort
and
a
series
of
such
collective
efforts
carries
a
nation
to
a
high
place
there
is
nothing
lasting
in
the
existing
groupings
at
the
moment
of
common
danger
eternal
union
and
unbreakable
solidarity
are
proclaimed
but
both
are
mere
literary
expressions
great
britain
the
country
which
has
the
least
need
to
make
war
has
been
at
war
for
centuries
with
nearly
all
the
european
countries
there
is
one
country
only
against
which
it
has
never
made
war
not
even
when
a
commercial
challenge
from
the
mercantile
republics
of
italy
seemed
possible
that
country
is
italy
that
shows
that
between
the
action
of
italy
there
is
not
nor
can
there
be
contrast
and
indeed
that
between
the
two
nations
there
is
complete
agreement
in
european
continental
policy
it
is
the
common
desire
of
the
two
nations
though
perhaps
for
different
reasons
that
no
one
state
shall
have
hegemony
on
the
continent
but
between
the
years
and
great
britain
and
france
were
at
war
for
seventy
years
for
seventy
years
that
is
out
of
a
hundred
and
there
was
a
state
of
deadly
hostility
between
the
two
countries
general
progress
evinced
in
various
ways
above
all
in
respect
for
and
in
the
autonomy
of
other
peoples
is
a
guarantee
for
all
no
peoples
are
always
victorious
none
always
conquered
in
the
time
of
napoleon
the
first
the
french
derided
the
lack
of
righting
spirit
in
the
german
peoples
producers
of
any
number
of
philosophers
and
writers
they
would
have
laughed
at
anyone
who
suggested
the
possibility
of
any
early
german
military
triumph
after
the
countries
of
the
holy
alliance
would
never
have
believed
in
the
possibility
of
the
revolutionary
spirit
recovering
they
were
sure
of
lasting
peace
in
europe
in
the
germans
had
no
doubt
at
all
that
they
had
surely
smothered
france
now
the
entente
thinks
that
it
has
surely
smothered
germany
but
civilization
has
gained
something
it
has
gained
that
collection
of
rules
moral
conditions
sentiments
international
regulations
which
tend
both
to
mitigate
violence
and
to
regulate
in
a
form
which
is
tolerable
if
not
always
just
relations
between
conquerors
and
conquered
above
all
a
respect
for
the
liberty
and
autonomy
of
the
latter
now
the
treaties
which
have
been
made
are
from
the
moral
point
of
view
immeasurably
worse
than
any
consummated
in
former
days
in
that
they
carry
europe
back
to
a
phase
of
civilization
which
was
thought
to
be
over
and
done
with
centuries
ago
they
are
a
danger
too
for
as
everyone
who
takes
vengeance
does
so
in
a
degree
greater
than
the
damage
suffered
if
one
supposes
for
a
moment
that
the
conquered
of
may
be
the
conquerors
of
to
what
lengths
of
violence
degradation
and
barbarism
may
not
europe
be
dragged
every
effort
then
should
now
be
made
to
follow
the
opposite
road
to
that
traversed
up
to
now
the
more
so
in
that
the
treaties
can
not
be
carried
out
and
if
it
is
desired
that
the
conquered
countries
shall
pay
compensation
to
the
conquerors
at
least
in
part
for
the
most
serious
damage
then
the
line
to
be
followed
must
be
based
on
realities
instead
of
on
violence
but
before
trying
to
see
how
and
why
the
treaties
can
not
be
carried
out
it
may
be
well
to
consider
how
the
actual
system
of
treaties
has
been
reached
in
complete
opposition
to
all
that
was
said
by
the
entente
during
the
war
and
to
president
wilson
fourteen
points
at
the
same
time
ought
to
be
examined
the
causes
which
led
in
six
months
from
the
declarations
of
the
entente
and
of
president
wilson
to
the
treaty
of
versailles
the
most
important
cause
for
what
has
happened
was
the
choice
of
paris
as
the
of
the
conference
after
the
war
paris
was
the
least
fitted
of
any
place
for
the
holding
of
a
peace
conference
and
in
the
two
french
leaders
the
president
of
the
republic
poincar√©
and
the
president
of
the
council
of
ministers
clemenceau
even
if
the
latter
was
more
adaptable
in
mind
and
more
open
to
consideration
of
arguments
on
the
other
side
were
two
temperaments
driving
inevitably
to
extremes
victory
had
come
in
a
way
that
surpassed
all
expectation
a
people
that
living
through
every
day
the
war
had
lasted
had
passed
through
every
sorrow
privation
agony
had
now
but
one
thought
to
destroy
the
enemy
the
atmosphere
of
paris
was
fiery
the
decision
of
the
peace
terms
to
be
imposed
on
the
enemy
was
to
be
taken
in
a
city
which
a
few
months
before
one
might
really
say
a
few
weeks
before
had
been
under
the
fire
of
the
guns
invented
by
the
germans
in
hourly
dread
of
enemy
aeroplanes
even
now
it
is
inexplicable
that
president
wilson
did
not
realize
the
situation
which
must
inevitably
come
about
it
is
possible
that
the
delirium
of
enthusiasm
with
which
he
was
received
at
paris
may
have
given
him
the
idea
that
it
was
in
him
alone
that
the
people
trusted
may
have
made
him
take
the
welcome
given
to
the
representative
of
the
deciding
factor
of
the
war
as
the
welcome
to
the
principles
which
he
had
proclaimed
to
the
world
months
later
when
he
left
france
amid
general
indifference
if
not
distrust
president
wilson
must
have
realized
that
he
had
lost
not
popularity
but
prestige
the
one
sure
element
of
success
for
the
head
of
a
government
much
more
so
for
the
head
of
a
state
it
was
inevitable
that
a
peace
conference
held
in
paris
only
a
few
months
after
the
war
with
the
direction
and
preparation
of
the
work
almost
entirely
in
french
hands
and
with
clemenceau
at
the
head
of
everything
should
conclude
as
it
did
conclude
all
the
more
so
when
italy
held
apart
right
from
the
beginning
and
england
though
convinced
of
the
mistakes
being
made
could
not
act
freely
and
effectively
the
first
duty
of
the
peace
conference
was
to
restore
a
state
of
equilibrium
and
conditions
of
life
taking
europe
as
an
economic
unity
broken
by
the
war
it
was
necessary
first
of
all
and
in
the
interests
of
all
to
conditions
of
life
which
would
make
it
possible
for
the
crisis
to
be
overcome
with
the
least
possible
damage
i
do
not
propose
to
tell
the
story
of
the
conference
and
it
is
as
well
to
say
at
once
that
i
do
not
intend
to
make
use
of
any
document
placed
in
my
hands
for
official
purposes
but
the
story
of
the
paris
conference
can
now
be
told
with
practical
completeness
after
what
has
been
published
by
keynes
in
his
noble
book
on
the
economic
consequences
of
the
war
and
by
the
american
secretary
of
state
robert
lansing
and
after
the
statements
made
in
the
british
and
french
parliaments
by
lloyd
george
and
clemenceau
but
from
the
political
point
of
view
the
most
interesting
document
is
still
andr√©
book
to
which
clemenceau
wrote
a
preface
and
which
expresses
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
french
delegation
at
the
conference
the
programme
which
france
laid
before
itself
and
what
it
obtained
this
book
explains
how
the
principal
decisions
were
taken
and
indeed
can
be
fairly
considered
to
show
in
a
more
reliable
way
than
any
other
publication
extant
how
the
work
of
the
conference
proceeded
for
not
only
was
tardieu
one
of
the
french
delegates
to
the
conference
one
of
those
who
signed
the
versailles
treaty
but
also
he
prepared
the
plan
of
work
as
well
as
the
solutions
of
the
most
important
questions
in
his
capacity
of
trusted
agent
of
the
prime
minister
the
determination
in
the
mind
of
president
wilson
when
he
came
to
paris
was
to
carry
through
his
programme
of
the
league
of
nations
he
was
fickle
in
his
infallibility
but
he
had
the
firmest
faith
that
he
was
working
for
the
peace
of
the
world
and
above
all
for
the
glory
of
the
united
states
of
european
things
he
was
supremely
ignorant
we
are
bound
to
recognize
his
good
faith
but
we
are
not
in
the
least
bound
on
that
account
to
admit
his
capacity
to
tackle
the
problems
which
with
his
academic
simplicity
he
set
himself
to
solve
when
he
arrived
in
europe
he
had
not
even
prepared
in
outline
a
scheme
of
what
the
league
of
nations
was
to
be
the
principal
problems
found
him
unprepared
and
the
duty
of
the
crowd
of
experts
sometimes
not
too
expert
who
followed
him
seemed
rather
to
be
to
demonstrate
the
truth
of
his
idea
than
to
prepare
material
for
seriously
thought
out
decisions
he
could
have
made
no
greater
mistake
than
he
did
in
coming
to
europe
to
take
part
in
the
meetings
of
the
conference
his
figure
lost
relief
at
once
in
a
way
it
seemed
to
lose
dignity
the
head
of
a
state
was
taking
part
in
meetings
of
heads
of
governments
one
of
the
latter
presiding
it
was
a
giant
compelled
to
live
in
a
cellar
and
thereby
sacrificing
his
height
he
was
surrounded
by
formal
respect
and
in
some
decisions
he
exercised
almost
despotic
authority
but
his
work
was
none
the
less
disordered
there
was
a
semblance
of
giving
in
to
him
while
he
was
giving
away
his
entire
programme
without
being
aware
of
it
in
his
ignorance
of
european
things
he
was
brought
without
recognizing
it
to
accept
a
series
of
decisions
not
superficially
in
opposition
to
his
fourteen
points
but
which
did
actually
nullify
them
great
britain
is
part
of
europe
but
is
not
on
the
continent
of
europe
while
germany
france
italy
austria
russia
hungary
holland
belgium
live
the
same
life
are
one
in
thought
great
britain
lives
in
her
superb
insularity
if
she
had
any
moment
of
supreme
anxiety
during
the
war
it
was
in
the
spring
and
summer
of
during
the
terrible
threat
of
the
destruction
of
her
shipping
by
submarines
and
the
inability
of
construction
to
keep
pace
with
it
but
after
the
defeat
of
germany
great
britain
found
herself
with
a
fleet
far
superior
to
those
of
all
the
rest
of
europe
put
together
once
more
she
broke

lloyd
george
with
swiftly
acting
brain
and
clear
insight
undoubtedly
the
most
remarkable
man
at
the
paris
conference
found
himself
in
a
difficult
situation
between
president
wilson
pronouncements
some
of
them
like
that
regarding
the
freedom
of
the
seas
undefined
and
dangerous
and
the
claims
of
france
tending
after
the
brutal
attack
it
had
had
to
meet
not
towards
a
true
peace
and
the
reconstruction
of
europe
but
towards
the
vivisection
of
germany
in
one
of
the
first
moments
just
before
the
general
elections
lloyd
george
too
promised
measures
of
the
greatest
severity
the
trial
of
the
kaiser
the
punishment
of
all
guilty
of
atrocities
compensation
for
all
who
had
suffered
from
the
war
the
widest
and
most
complete
indemnity
but
such
pronouncements
gave
way
before
his
clear
realization
of
facts
and
later
on
he
tried
in
vain
to
put
the
conference
on
the
plane
of
such
realization
italy
as
tardieu
says
very
plainly
carried
no
weight
in
the
conference
in
the
meetings
of
the
prime

wilson
clemenceau
lloyd
the
italian
government
came
into
the
war
in
may
on
the
basis
of
the
london
agreement
of
the
preceding
april
and
it
had
never
thought
of
claiming
fiume
either
before
the
war
when
it
was
free
to
lay
down
conditions
or
during
the
progress
of
the
war
the
italian
people
had
always
been
kept
in
ignorance
of
the
principles
established
in
the
london
agreement
one
of
the
men
chiefly
responsible
for
the
american
policy
openly
complained
to
me
that
when
the
united
states
came
into
the
war
no
notification
was
given
them
of
the
london
agreement
in
which
were
defined
the
future
conditions
of
part
of
europe
a
far
worse
mistake
was
made
in
the
failure
to
communicate
the
london
agreement
to
serbia
which
would
certainly
have
accepted
it
without
hesitation
in
the
terrible
position
in
which
it
then
was
but
the
most
serious
thing
of
all
was
that
italian
ministers
were
unaware
of
its
provisions
till
after
its
publication
in
london
by
the
organ
of
the
which
had
evidently
received
the
text
from
petrograd
where
the
bolsheviks
had
published
it
in
italy
the
london
agreement
was
a
mystery
to
everyone
its
text
was
known
only
to
the
presidents
of
the
council
and
the
minister
for
foreign
affairs
of
the
war
cabinets
thus
only
four
or
five
people
knew
about
it
secrecy
was
strictly
kept
and
moreover
it
can
not
possibly
be
said
that
it
was
in
accordance
either
with
national
ideals
or
the
currents
of
public
opinion
much
less
with
any
intelligent
conception
of
italy
needs
and
italy
future
the
framers
of
the
london
agreement
never
thought
of
fiume
indeed
they
specifically
expressed
their
willingness
that
it
should
go
to
croatia
whether
in
the
case
of
remaining
united
or
of
the
detachment
of
croatia
from
it
it
is
not
true
that
it
was
through
the
opposition
of
russia
or
of
france
that
the
italian
framers
of
the
london
agreement
gave
up
all
claim
to
fiume
there
was
no
opposition
because
there
was
no
claim
the
representatives
of
russia
and
france
have
told
me
officially
that
no
renunciation
took
place
through
any
action
on
the
part
of
their
governments
because
no
claim
was
ever
made
to
them
on
the
other
hand
after
the
armistice
and
when
it
became
known
through
the
newspapers
that
the
london
agreement
gave
fiume
to
croatia
a
very
strong
movement
for
fiume
arose
fanned
by
the
government
itself
and
an
equally
strong
movement
in
fiume
also
if
in
the
london
agreement
instead
of
claiming
large
areas
of
dalmatia
which
are
entirely
or
almost
entirely
slav
provision
had
been
made
for
the
constitution
of
a
state
of
fiume
placed
in
a
condition
to
guarantee
not
only
the
people
of
italian
nationality
but
the
economic
interests
of
all
the
peoples
in
it
and
surrounding
it
there
is
no
doubt
that
such
a
claim
on
the
part
of
italy
would
have
gone
through
without
opposition
during
the
paris
conference
the
representatives
of
italy
showed
hardly
any
interest
at
all
in
the
problems
concerning
the
peace
of
europe
the
situation
of
the
conquered
peoples
the
distribution
of
raw
materials
the
regulation
of
the
new
states
and
their
relations
with
the
victor
countries
they
concentrated
all
their
efforts
on
the
question
of
fiume
that
is
to
say
on
the
one
point
in
which
italian
action
was
fundamentally
weak
in
that
when
it
was
free
to
enter
into
the
war
and
lay
down
conditions
of
peace
at
the
moment
when
the
entente
was
without
america
invaluable
assistance
and
was
beginning
to
doubt
the
capacity
of
russia
to
carry
on
it
had
never
even
asked
for
fiume
in
its
war
treaty
that
it
had
made
the
inexplicable
mistake
of
neglecting
to
communicate
that
treaty
to
the
united
states
when
that
country
came
into
the
war
and
to
serbia
at
the
moment
when
italy
effort
was
most
valuable
for
its
help
at
the
conference
italy
had
no
directing
policy
it
had
been
a
part
of
the
system
of
the
german
alliance
but
it
had
left
its
allies
germany
and
because
it
recognized
that
the
war
was
unjust
and
had
remained
neutral
for
ten
months
then
entering
into
the
war
freely
and
without
obligation
there
was
one
road
for
it
to
follow
that
of
proclaiming
solemnly
and
defending
the
principles
of
democracy
and
justice
indeed
that
was
a
moral
duty
in
that
the
break
with
the
two
countries
with
which
italy
had
been
in
alliance
for
years
became
a
matter
not
only
of
honesty
but
of
duty
solely
through
the
injustice
of
the
cause
for
which
they
had
proclaimed
an
offensive
war
it
was
not
possible
for
italy
to
go
to
war
to
realize
the
dream
of
uniting
the
italian
lands
to
the
nation
for
she
had
entered
the
system
of
alliance
of
the
central
empires
and
had
stayed
there
long
years
while
having
all
the
time
italian
territories
unjustly
subjected
to
the
annexation
of
the
italian
lands
to
the
kingdom
of
italy
had
to
be
the
consequence
of
the
affirmation
of
the
principles
of
nationality
not
the
reason
for
going
to
war
in
any
case
for
italy
which
had
laid
on
itself
in
the
london
agreement
the
most
absurd
limitations
which
had
confined
its
war
aims
within
exceedingly
modest
limits
which
had
no
share
in
the
distribution
of
the
wealth
of
the
conquered
countries
which
came
out
of
the
war
without
raw
materials
and
without
any
share
in
germany
colonial
empire
it
was
a
matter
not
only
of
high
duty
but
of
the
greatest
utility
to
proclaim
and
uphold
all
those
principles
which
the
entente
had
so
often
and
so
publicly
proclaimed
as
its
war
policy
and
its
war
aims
but
in
the
paris
conference
italy
hardly
counted
without
any
definite
idea
of
its
own
policy
it
followed
france
and
the
united
states
sometimes
it
followed
great
britain
there
was
no
affirmation
of
principles
at
all
the
country
which
among
all
the
european
warring
powers
had
suffered
most
severely
in
proportion
to
its
resources
and
should
have
made
the
greatest
effort
to
free
itself
from
the
burdens
imposed
on
it
took
no
part
in
the
most
important
decisions
it
has
to
be
added
that
these
were
arrived
at
between
march
and
may
while
the
italian
representatives
were
absent
from
paris
or
had
returned
there
humbled
without
having
been
recalled
after
interminable
discussions
which
decided
very
little
especially
with
regard
to
the
league
of
nations
which
arose
before
the
nations
were
constituted
and
could
live
real
vital
questions
were
tackled
as
is
seen
from
the
report
of
the
conference
on
march
and
it
is
a
fact
that
between
that
date
and
may
the
whole
treaty
was
put
in
shape
territorial
questions
financial
questions
economic
questions
colonial
questions
now
at
that
very
moment
on
account
of
the
question
of
fiume
and
fiume
alone
for
some
inscrutable
reason
the
italian
delegates
thought
good
to
retire
from
the
conference
to
which
they
returned
later
without
being
invited
and
during
that
time
all
the
demonstrations
against
president
wilson
took
place
in
italy
not
without
some
grave
responsibility
on
the
part
of
the
government
italy
received
least
consideration
in
the
peace
treaties
among
all
the
conquering
countries
it
was
practically
put
on
one
side
it
has
to
be
noted
that
both
in
the
armistice
and
in
the
peace
treaty
the
most
serious
decisions
were
arrived
at
almost
incidentally
moreover
they
were
always
vitiated
by
slight
concessions
apparently
of
importance
on
november
when
the
representatives
of
the
different
nations
met
at
paris
to
fix
the
terms
of
armistice
tardieu
relates
the
question
of
reparation
for
damages
was
decided
quite
incidentally
it
is
worth
while
reproducing
what
he
says
in
his
book
taken
from
the
official

if
i
were
at
liberty
to
publish
the
official
report
of
the
doings
of
the
conference
while
the
various
peace
treaties
were
being
prepared
as
mm
poincar√©
and
tardieu
have
published
secret
acts
it
would
be
seen
that
the
proceedings
were
very
much
the
same
in
every
case
meanwhile
we
may
confine
ourselves
to
an
examination
of
the
report
as
given
by
tardieu
the
question
of
reparation
of
damages
was
not
a
condition
of
the
armistice
it
had
not
been
accepted
clemenceau
brings
the
question
up
again
solely
in
homage
to
french
public
opinion
the
suggestion
is
to
write
in
simply
the
three
words
of
it
is
true
that
these
three
words
determine
a
policy
and
that
there
is
no
mention
of
it
in
the
claims
of
the
entente
in
the
fourteen
points
of
president
wilson
or
in
the
armistice
between
italy
and
in
his
fourteen
points
wilson
confined
himself
in
the
matter
of
damages
to
the
following
claims
reconstruction
of
belgium
reconstruction
of
french
territory
invaded
reparation
for
territory
invaded
in
serbia
montenegro
and
rumania
there
is
no
other
claim
or
statement
in
the
fourteen
points
on
the
other
hand
the
pronouncement
des
included
as
in
fact
was
afterwards
included
any
claim
for
damage
by
land
or
sea
the
representatives
of
belgium
italy
and
great
britain
remark
that
it
is
a
condition
of
peace
not
of
armistice
but
clemenceau
makes
it
a
question
of
regard
and
consideration
for
france
france
would
not
understand
there
being
no
mention
of
it
there
was
no
desire
to
define
anything
only
just
to
mention
it
and
in
three
simple
words
i
ask
you
says
clemenceau
to
put
yourselves
into
the
spirit
of
the
people
of
france
at
once
the
british
representative
notes
the
necessity
of
a
clear
statement
regarding
reparations
for
losses
at
sea
through
submarines
and
mines
and
all
the
serbian
the
belgian
and
last
of
all
the
italian
at
once
call
attention
to
their
own
damages
house
not
realizing
the
wide
and
serious
nature
of
the
claim
says
that
it
is
an
important
question
for
all
while
america
had
already
stated
in
the
words
of
the
president
of
the
republic
that
it
renounced
all
indemnity
of
any
nature
whatsoever
so
was
established
quite
incidentally
the
principle
of
indemnity
for
damages
which
gave
the
treaty
a
complete
turn
away
from
the
spirit
of
the
pronouncements
by
the
entente
and
the
united
states
equally
incidentally
were
established
all
the
declarations
in
the
treaty
the
purpose
of
which
is
not
easy
to
understand
except
in
so
far
as
it
is
seen
in
the
economic
results
which
may
accrue
article
of
the
treaty
of
versailles
states
that
the
allied
and
associated
governments
affirm
and
germany
accepts
the
responsibility
of
germany
and
her
allies
for
causing
all
the
loss
and
damage
to
which
the
allied
and
associated
governments
and
their
peoples
have
been
subjected
as
a
consequence
of
the
war
imposed
on
them
by
the
aggression
of
germany
and
her
allies
article
of
the
treaty
of
states
in
the
same
way
that
the
allied
and
associated
governments
affirm
and
accepts
the
responsibility
of
austria
and
her
allies
etc
this
article
is
common
to
all
the
treaties
and
it
would
have
no
more
than
historic
and
philosophic
interest
if
it
were
not
followed
by
another
article
in
which
the
allied
and
associated
governments
recognize
that
the
resources
of
germany
and
of
etc
are
not
adequate
after
taking
into
account
permanent
diminutions
of
such
resources
which
will
result
from
other
provisions
of
the
present
treaty
to
make
complete
reparation
for
all
such
loss
and
damage
the
allied
and
associated
governments
however
require
and
germany
undertakes
that
she
will
make
compensation
for
all
damage
done
to
the
civilian
population
of
the
allied
and
associated
powers
and
to
their
property
during
the
period
of
the
belligerency
of
each
as
an
allied
or
associated
power
against
germany
by
such
aggression
by
land
by
sea
and
from
the
air
and
in
general
all
damage
as
defined
in
the
treaty
comprising
many
of
the
burdens
of
war
war
pensions
and
compensations
to
soldiers
and
their
families
cost
of
assistance
to
families
of
those
mobilized
during
the
war
there
is
nothing
more
useless
indeed
more
stupid
than
to
take
your
enemy
by
the
throat
after
you
have
beaten
him
and
force
him
to
declare
that
all
the
wrong
was
on
his
side
the
declaration
is
of
no
use
whatever
either
to
the
conqueror
because
no
importance
can
be
attributed
to
an
admission
extorted
by
force
or
to
the
conquered
because
he
knows
that
there
is
no
moral
significance
in
being
forced
to
state
what
one
does
not
believe
or
for
third
parties
because
they
are
well
aware
of
the
circumstances
under
which
the
declaration
was
made
it
is
possible
that
president
wilson
wanted
to
establish
a
moral
reason
i
do
not
like
to
say
a
moral
alibi
for
accepting
as
he
was
constrained
by
necessity
to
accept
all
those
conditions
which
were
the
negation
of
what
he
had
solemnly
laid
down
the
moral
pledge
of
his
people
of
the
american
democracy
germany
and
the
conquered
countries
have
accepted
the
conditions
imposed
on
them
with
the
reserve
that
they
feel
that
they
are
not
bound
by
them
even
morally
in
the
future
the
future
will
pour
ridicule
on
this
new
form
of
treaty
which
endeavours
to
justify
excessive
and
absurd
demands
which
will
have
the
effect
of
destroying
the
enemy
rather
than
of
obtaining
any
sure
benefit
by
using
a
forced
declaration
which
has
no
value
at
all
i
have
always
detested
german
imperialism
and
also
the
phases
of
exaggerated
nationalism
which
have
grown
up
in
every
country
after
the
war
and
have
been
eliminated
one
after
the
other
through
the
simple
fact
of
their
being
common
to
all
countries
but
only
after
having
brought
the
greatest
possible
harm
to
all
the
peoples
and
i
can
not
say
that
germany
and
her
allies
were
solely
responsible
for
the
war
which
devastated
europe
and
threw
a
dark
shadow
over
the
life
of
the
whole
world
that
statement
which
we
all
made
during
the
war
was
a
weapon
to
be
used
at
the
time
now
that
the
war
is
over
it
can
not
be
looked
on
as
a
serious
argument
an
honest
and
thorough
examination
of
all
the
diplomatic
documents
all
the
agreements
and
relations
of
days
compels
me
to
declare
solemnly
that
the
responsibility
for
the
war
does
not
lie
solely
on
the
defeated
countries
that
germany
may
have
desired
war
and
prepared
for
it
under
the
influence
of
powerful
industrial
interests
metallurgic
for
instance
responsible
for
the
extreme
views
of
newspapers
and
other
publications
but
still
all
the
warring
countries
have
their
share
of
responsibility
in
differing
degree
it
can
not
be
said
that
there
existed
in
europe
two
groups
with
a
moral
conception
differing
to
the
point
of
complete
contrast
on
one
side
germany
turkey
and
bulgaria
responsible
for
the
war
which
they
imposed
by
their
aggression
on
the
other
all
the
free
and
independent
nations
by
the
side
of
england
france
italy
and
the
united
states
there
was
russia
which
must
bear
if
not
the
greatest
a
very
great
responsibility
for
what
happened
nor
is
it
true
that
armament
expenses
in
the
ten
years
preceding
the
war
were
greater
in
the
central
empires
or
to
put
it
better
in
the
states
forming
the
triple
alliance
than
in
the
countries
which
later
formed
the
european
entente
it
is
not
true
that
only
in
the
case
of
germany
were
the
war
aims
imperialist
and
that
the
entente
countries
came
in
without
desire
of
conquest
putting
aside
for
the
moment
what
one
sees
in
the
treaties
which
have
followed
the
war
it
is
worth
while
considering
what
would
have
happened
if
russia
had
won
the
war
instead
of
being
torn
to
pieces
before
victory
came
russia
would
have
had
all
the
poland
of
the
eighteenth
century
with
the
apparent
autonomy
promised
by
the
tsar
nearly
all
turkey
in
europe
constantinople
and
a
great
part
of
asia
minor
russia
with
already
the
greatest
existing
land
empire
and
at
least
half
the
population
not
russian
would
have
gained
fresh
territories
with
fresh
populations
putting
the
mediterranean
peoples
and
above
all
italy
in
a
very
difficult
situation
indeed
it
can
not
be
said
that
in
the
ten
years
preceding
the
war
russia
did
not
do
as
much
as
germany
to
bring
unrest
into
europe
it
was
on
account
of
russia
that
the
serbian
government
was
a
perpetual
cause
of
disturbance
a
perpetual
threat
to
the
unending
strife
in
the
balkans
was
caused
by
russia
in
no
less
degree
than
by
and
all
the
great
european
nations
shared
with
opposing
views
in
the
policy
of
eastern
expansion
the
judgment
of
peoples
and
of
events
given
the
uncertainty
of
policy
as
expressed
in
parliament
and
newspapers
is
variable
to
the
last
degree
it
will
be
enough
to
recall
the
varying
judgment
upon
serbia
during
the
last
ten
years
in
the
press
of
great
britain
france
and
italy
the
people
of
serbia
have
been
described
as
criminals
and
heroes
assassins
and
martyrs
no
one
would
have
anything
to
do
with
serbia
later
serbia
was
raised
to
the
skies
the
documents
published
by
kautsky
in
germany
and
those
revealed
from
time
to
time
by
the
moscow
government
prove
that
the
preparation
for
and
conviction
of
war
was
not
only
on
the
part
of
the
central
empires
but
also
and
in
no
less
degree
on
the
part
of
the
other
states
one
point
will
always
remain
inexplicable
why
russia
should
have
taken
the
superlatively
serious
step
of
general
mobilization
which
could
not
be
and
was
not
a
simple
measure
of
precaution
it
is
beyond
doubt
that
the
russian
mobilization
preceded
even
that
of
austria
after
a
close
examination
of
events
after
the
bitter
feeling
of
war
had
passed
in
his
speech
of
december
lloyd
george
said
justly
that
the
war
broke
out
without
any
government
having
really
desired
it
all
in
one
way
or
another
slithered
into
it
stumbling
and
tripping
there
were
three
monarchies
in
europe
the
russian
german
and
empires
and
the
fact
that
they
were
divided
into
two
groups
necessarily
led
to
war
it
was
inevitable
sooner
or
later
russia
was
the
greatest
danger
the
greatest
threat
to
europe
what
happened
had
to
happen
under
one
form
or
another
the
crazy
giant
was
under
the
charge
of
one
man
without
intelligence
and
a
band
of
men
the
men
of
the
old
regime
largely
without
scruples
each
country
of
europe
has
its
share
of
responsibility
italy
not
excluded
it
is
difficult
to
explain
why
italy
went
to
tripoli
in
the
way
in
which
she
did
in
bringing
about
the
war
which
brought
about
the
two
balkan
wars
and
the
policy
of
adventure
of
serbia
which
was
the
incident
though
not
the
cause
of
the
european
war
the
libyan
adventure
considered
now
in
the
serene
light
of
reason
can
not
be
looked
on
as
anything
but
an
aberration
libya
is
an
immense
box
of
sand
which
never
had
any
value
nor
has
it
now
tripolitania
cyrenaica
and
fezzan
cover
more
than
one
million
one
hundred
thousand
square
kilometres
and
have
less
than
nine
hundred
thousand
inhabitants
of
whom
even
now
after
ten
years
less
than
a
third
are
under
the
effective
control
of
italy
with
the
war
and
expenses
of
occupation
libya
has
cost
italy
about
seven
milliard
lire
and
for
a
long
time
yet
it
will
be
on
the
debit
side
in
the
life
of
the
nation
with
the
same
number
of
milliards
most
of
which
were
spent
before
the
european
war
italy
could
have
put
in
order
and
utilized
her
immense
patrimony
of
and
would
be
free
from
anxiety
about
the
coal
problem
by
which
it
is
actually
enslaved
the
true
policy
of
the
nation
was
to
gain
economic
independence
not
a
barren
waste
ignorant
people
spoke
of
libya
in
italy
as
a
promised
land
in
one
official
speech
the
king
was
even
made
to
say
that
libya
could
absorb
part
of
italian
emigration
that
was
just
a
phenomenon
of
madness
for
libya
has
no
value
at
all
from
the
agricultural
commercial
or
military
point
of
view
it
may
pay
its
way
one
day
but
only
if
all
expenses
are
cut
down
and
the
administrative
system
is
completely
changed
it
may
be
that
if
only
from
a
feeling
of
duty
towards
the
inhabitants
italy
can
not
abandon
libya
now
that
she
has
taken
it
but
the
question
will
always
be
asked
why
she
did
take
it
why
she
took
it
by
violence
when
a
series
of
concessions
could
have
been
obtained
without
difficulty
from
the
turkish
government
the
libyan
enterprise
undertaken
on
an
impulse
against
the
opinion
of
italy
allies
austria
and
germany
against
the
wish
of
england
and
france
is
a
very
serious
political
responsibility
for
italy
the
european
war
was
the
consequence
of
a
long
series
of
movements
aspirations
agitations
it
can
not
be
denied
and
it
is
recognized
by
men
like
lloyd
george
that
france
and
england
too
have
by
their
actions
taken
on
themselves
their
part
in
the
serious
responsibility
to
say
that
in
the
past
they
had
never
thought
of
war
is
to
say
a
thing
not
true
and
there
is
no
doubt
that
all
the
diplomatic
documents
published
before
and
during
the
war
show
in
russia
above
all
a
situation
which
inevitably
would
soon
lead
to
war
in
the
balkans
especially
in
serbia
russia
was
pursuing
a
cynical
and
shameless
policy
of
corruption
nourishing
and
exciting
every
ferment
of
revolt
against
russian
policy
in
serbia
was
really
criminal
everyone
in
germany
was
convinced
that
russia
was
preparing
for
war
the
tsar
pacificist
ideas
were
of
no
importance
whatever
in
absolute
monarchies
it
is
an
illusion
to
think
that
the
sovereign
though
apparently
an
autocrat
acts
in
accordance
with
his
own
views
his
views
are
almost
invariably
those
of
the
people
round
him
he
does
not
even
receive
news
in
its
true
form
but
in
the
form
given
it
by
officials
russia
was
an
unwieldy
giant
who
had
shown
signs
of
madness
long
before
the
actual
revolution
it
is
impossible
that
a
collective
madness
such
as
that
which
has
had
possession
of
russia
for
three
years
could
be
produced
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
the
regime
of
autocracy
contained
in
itself
the
germs
of
bolshevism
and
violence
bolshevism
can
not
properly
be
judged
by
western
notions
it
is
not
a
revolutionary
movement
of
the
people
it
is
as
i
have
said
before
the
religious
fanaticism
of
the
eastern
orthodox
rising
from
the
dead
body
of
tsarist
despotism
bolshevism
centralizing
and
bureaucratic
follows
the
same
lines
as
the
imperial
policy
of
almost
every
tsar
undoubtedly
the
greatest
responsibility
for
the
war
lies
on
germany
if
it
has
not
to
bear
all
the
responsibility
as
the
treaties
claim
it
has
to
bear
the
largest
share
and
the
responsibility
lies
rather
than
on
the
shoulders
of
the
emperor
and
the
quite
ordinary
men
who
surrounded
him
on
those
of
the
military
caste
and
some
great
industrial
groups
the
crazy
writings
of
general
von
bernhardi
and
other
scandalous
publications
of
the
same
sort
expressed
more
than
just
theoretical
views
the
real
hopes
and
tendencies
of
the
whole
military
caste
it
is
true
enough
that
there
existed
in
germany
a
real
democratic
society
under
the
control
of
the
civil
government
but
there
was
the
military
caste
too
with
privileges
in
social
life
and
a
special
position
in
the
life
of
the
state
this
caste
was
educated
in
the
conception
of
violence
as
the
means
of
power
and
grandeur
when
a
country
has
allowed
the
military
and
social
theories
of
general
von
bernhardi
and
the
senselessly
criminal
pronouncements
of
the
emperor
william
ii
to
prevail
for
so
many
years
it
has
put
the
most
formidable
weapons
possible
into
the
hands
of
its
enemies
the
people
who
governed
germany
for
so
long
have
no
right
to
complain
now
of
the
conditions
in
which
their
country
is
placed
but
the
great
german
people
hardworking
and
persevering
has
full
right
to
look
on
such
conditions
as
the
negation
of
justice
the
head
of
a
european
state
a
man
of
the
clearest
view
and
calmest
judgment
speaking
to
me
of
the
emperor
william
of
whose
character
and
intellect
he
thought
very
little
expressed
the
view
that
the
emperor
did
not
want
war
but
that
he
would
not
avoid
it
when
he
had
the
chance
the
truth
is
that
germany
troubled
itself
very
little
about
france
kinderlen
w√§chter
the
most
intelligent
of
the
german
foreign
ministers
and
perhaps
the
one
most
opposed
to
the
war
when
he
outlined
to
me
the
situation
as
it
was
ten
years
ago
showed
no
anxiety
at
all
except
in
regard
to
russia
russia
might
make
war
and
it
was
necessary
to
be
ready
or
to
see
that
it
came
about
at
a
moment
when
victory
was
certain
if
conditions
did
not
change
germany
had
no
reason
at
all
for
making
war
on
france
from
the
time
that
it
had
got
well
ahead
of
that
country
in
industry
commerce
and
navigation
it
is
true
that
there
were
a
certain
number
of
unbalanced
people
in
the
metal
industry
who
talked
complacently
of
french
iron
and
stirred
up
the
yellow
press
just
as
in
france
there
are
many
industrials
with
their
eyes
fixed
on
german
coal
which
they
want
to
seize
as
far
as
possible
but
the
intellectuals
the
politicians
even
military
circles
had
no
anxiety
at
all
except
with
regard
to
russia
there
were
mistaken
views
in
german
policy
no
doubt
but
at
the
same
time
there
was
real
anxiety
about
her
national
existence
with
a
huge
population
and
limited
resources
with
few
colonies
owing
to
her
late
arrival
in
the
competition
for
them
germany
looked
on
the
desire
of
russia
for
constantinople
as
the
ruin
of
her
policy
of
expansion
in
the
east
and
in
actual
fact
there
was
but
one
way
by
which
the
three
great
empires
which
in
population
and
extension
of
territory
dominated
the
greater
part
of
europe
could
avoid
war
and
that
was
to
join
in
alliance
among
themselves
or
at
least
not
to
enter
other
alliances
the
three
great
empires
divided
themselves
into
two
allied
groups
from
that
moment
given
the
fact
that
in
each
of
them
the
military
caste
held
power
that
the
principal
decisions
lay
in
the
hands
of
a
few
men
not
responsible
to
parliament
given
the
fact
that
russia
faithful
to
her
traditional
policy
aimed
to
draw
into
her
political
orbit
all
the
slav
peoples
right
down
to
the
adriatic
and
the
aegean
and
austria
was
leaning
toward
the
creation
of
a
third
slav
monarchy
in
the
dual
kingdom
it
was
inevitable
that
sooner
or
later
the
violence
intrigue
and
corruption
with
which
we
are
familiar
should
culminate
in
open
conflict
bismarck
always
saw
that
putting
russia
and
germany
up
against
each
other
meant
war
peoples
like
individuals
are
far
from
representing
with
anything
approaching
completeness
such
social
conceptions
as
we
call
violence
and
right
honesty
and
bad
faith
justice
and
injustice
each
people
has
its
different
characteristics
but
no
one
people
represents
good
or
another
bad
no
one
represents
brutality
or
another
civilization
all
these
meaningless
phrases
were
brought
out
during
the
war
according
to
which
as
was
said
by
one
of
the
prime
ministers
of
the
entente
the
war
was
the
decisive
struggle
between
the
forces
of
autocracy
and
liberty
between
the
dark
powers
of
evil
and
violence
and
the
radiant
powers
of
good
and
right
all
this
causes
nothing
but
a
smile
such
things
are
just
speechifying
and
banal
at
that
perhaps
they
were
a
necessity
of
which
might
well
be
made
use
of
when
you
are
fighting
for
your
very
life
you
use
every
means
you
have
when
you
are
in
imminent
danger
you
do
not
choose
your
weapons
you
use
everything
to
hand
all
the
war
propaganda
against
the
german
empires
recounting
sometimes
exaggerating
all
the
crimes
of
the
enemy
claiming
that
all
the
guilt
was
on
the
side
of
germany
describing
german
atrocities
as
a
habit
almost
a
characteristic
of
the
german
people
deriding
german
culture
as
a
species
of
liquid
in
which
were
bred
the
microbes
of
moral
madness
all
this
was
legitimate
perhaps
necessary
during
the
war
the
reply
to
the
asphyxiating
gas
of
the
enemy
was
not
only
the
same
gas
but
a
propaganda
calculated
to
do
more
damage
and
which
in
fact
did
do
as
much
damage
as
tanks
and
blockade
but
when
war
is
over
nothing
should
be
put
into
a
peace
treaty
except
such
things
as
will
lead
to
a
lasting
peace
or
the
most
lasting
peace
compatible
with
our
degree
of
civilization
on
january
president
wilson
explained
the
reasons
why
he
made
the
proposal
to
put
an
end
to
the
war
he
said
in
the
american
senate
that
the
greatest
danger
lay
in
a
peace
imposed
by
conquerors
after
victory
at
that
time
it
was
said
that
there
must
be
neither
conquerors
nor
conquered
a
peace
imposed
after
victory
would
be
the
cause
of
so
much
humiliation
and
such
intolerable
sacrifices
for
the
conquered
side
it
would
be
so
severe
it
would
give
rise
to
so
much
bitter
feeling
that
it
would
not
be
a
lasting
peace
but
one
founded
on
shifting
sand
in
the
spring
of
just
before
the
most
serious
decisions
were
to
be
taken
lloyd
george
put
before
the
conference
a
memorandum
entitled
considerations
for
the
peace
conference
before
they
finally
draft
their
with
his
marvellously
quick
insight
after
having
listened
to
the
speeches
of
which
force
was
the
leading
motive
the
tendency
round
him
was
not
to
establish
a
lasting
peace
but
to
vivisect
germany
lloyd
george
saw
that
it
was
not
a
true
peace
that
was
being
prepared
on
march
lloyd
george
presented
the
following
memorandum
to
the
conference
i
when
nations
are
exhausted
by
wars
in
which
they
have
put
forth
all
their
strength
and
which
leave
them
tired
bleeding
and
broken
it
is
not
difficult
to
patch
up
a
peace
that
may
last
until
the
generation
which
experienced
the
horrors
of
the
war
has
passed
away
pictures
of
heroism
and
triumph
only
tempt
those
who
know
nothing
of
the
sufferings
and
terrors
of
war
it
is
therefore
comparatively
easy
to
patch
up
a
peace
which
will
last
for
thirty
years
what
is
difficult
however
is
to
draw
up
a
peace
which
will
not
provoke
a
fresh
struggle
when
those
who
have
had
practical
experience
of
what
war
means
have
passed
away
history
has
proved
that
a
peace
which
has
been
hailed
by
a
victorious
nation
as
a
triumph
of
diplomatic
skill
and
statesmanship
even
of
moderation
in
the
long
run
has
proved
itself
to
be
and
charged
with
danger
to
the
victor
the
peace
of
was
believed
by
germany
to
ensure
not
only
her
security
but
her
permanent
supremacy
the
facts
have
shown
exactly
the
contrary
france
itself
has
demonstrated
that
those
who
say
you
can
make
germany
so
feeble
that
she
will
never
be
able
to
hit
back
are
utterly
wrong
year
by
year
france
became
numerically
weaker
in
comparison
with
her
victorious
neighbour
but
in
reality
she
became
ever
more
powerful
she
kept
watch
on
europe
she
made
alliance
with
those
whom
germany
had
wronged
or
menaced
she
never
ceased
to
warn
the
world
of
its
danger
and
ultimately
she
was
able
to
secure
the
overthrow
of
the
far
mightier
power
which
had
trampled
so
brutally
upon
her
you
may
strip
germany
of
her
colonies
reduce
her
armaments
to
a
mere
police
force
and
her
navy
to
that
of
a
power
all
the
same
in
the
end
if
she
feels
that
she
has
been
unjustly
treated
in
the
peace
of
she
will
find
means
of
exacting
retribution
from
her
conquerors
the
impression
the
deep
impression
made
upon
the
human
heart
by
four
years
of
unexampled
slaughter
will
disappear
with
the
hearts
upon
which
it
has
been
marked
by
the
terrible
sword
of
the
great
war
the
maintenance
of
peace
will
then
depend
upon
there
being
no
causes
of
exasperation
constantly
stirring
up
the
spirit
of
patriotism
of
justice
or
of
fair
play
to
achieve
redress
our
terms
may
be
severe
they
may
be
stern
and
even
ruthless
but
at
the
same
time
they
can
be
so
just
that
the
country
on
which
they
are
imposed
will
feel
in
its
heart
that
it
has
no
right
to
complain
but
injustice
arrogance
displayed
in
the
hour
of
triumph
will
never
be
forgotten
nor
forgiven
for
these
reasons
i
am
therefore
strongly
averse
to
transferring
more
germans
from
german
rule
to
the
rule
of
some
other
nation
than
can
possibly
be
helped
i
can
not
conceive
any
greater
cause
of
future
war
than
that
the
german
people
who
have
certainly
proved
themselves
one
of
the
most
vigorous
and
powerful
races
in
the
world
should
be
surrounded
by
a
number
of
small
states
many
of
them
consisting
of
people
who
have
never
previously
set
up
a
stable
government
for
themselves
but
each
of
them
containing
large
masses
of
germans
clamouring
for
reunion
with
their
native
land
the
proposal
of
the
polish
commission
that
we
should
place
germans
under
the
control
of
a
people
of
a
different
religion
and
which
has
never
proved
its
capacity
for
stable
throughout
its
history
must
in
my
judgment
lead
sooner
or
later
to
a
new
war
in
the
east
of
europe
what
i
have
said
about
the
germans
is
equally
true
about
the
magyars
there
will
never
be
peace
in
europe
if
every
little
state
now
coming
into
being
is
to
have
a
large
magyar
irredenta
within
its
borders
i
would
therefore
take
as
a
guiding
principle
of
the
peace
that
as
far
as
is
humanly
possible
the
different
races
should
be
allocated
to
their
motherlands
and
that
this
human
criterion
should
have
precedence
over
considerations
of
strategy
or
economics
or
communications
which
can
usually
be
adjusted
by
other
means
secondly
i
would
say
that
the
duration
for
the
payments
of
reparation
ought
to
disappear
if
possible
with
the
generation
which
made
the
war
but
there
is
a
consideration
in
favour
of
a
peace
which
influences
me
even
more
than
the
desire
to
leave
no
causes
justifying
a
fresh
outbreak
thirty
years
hence
there
is
one
element
in
the
present
condition
of
nations
which
differentiates
it
from
the
situation
as
it
was
in
in
the
napoleonic
wars
the
countries
were
equally
exhausted
but
the
revolutionary
spirit
had
spent
its
force
in
the
country
of
its
birth
and
germany
had
satisfied
the
legitimate
popular
demands
for
the
time
being
by
a
series
of
economic
changes
which
were
inspired
by
courage
foresight
and
high
statesmanship
even
in
russia
the
tsar
had
effected
great
reforms
which
were
probably
at
that
time
even
too
advanced
for
the
population
the
situation
is
very
different
now
the
revolution
is
still
in
its
infancy
the
extreme
figures
of
the
terror
are
still
in
command
in
russia
the
whole
of
europe
is
filled
with
the
spirit
of
revolution
there
is
a
deep
sense
not
only
of
discontent
but
of
anger
and
revolt
among
the
workmen
against
conditions
the
whole
existing
order
in
its
political
social
and
economic
aspects
is
questioned
by
the
masses
of
the
population
from
one
end
of
europe
to
the
other
in
some
countries
like
germany
and
russia
the
unrest
takes
the
form
of
open
rebellion
in
others
like
france
great
britain
and
italy
it
takes
the
shape
of
strikes
and
of
general
disinclination
to
settle
down
to
work
symptoms
which
are
just
as
much
concerned
with
the
desire
for
political
and
social
change
as
with
wage
demands
much
of
this
unrest
is
healthy
we
shall
never
make
a
lasting
peace
by
attempting
to
restore
the
conditions
of
but
there
is
a
danger
that
we
may
throw
the
masses
of
the
population
throughout
europe
into
the
arms
of
the
extremists
whose
only
idea
for
regenerating
mankind
is
to
destroy
utterly
the
whole
existing
fabric
of
society
these
men
have
triumphed
in
russia
they
have
done
so
at
a
terrible
price
hundreds
and
thousands
of
the
population
have
perished
the
railways
the
roads
the
towns
the
whole
structural
organization
of
russia
has
been
almost
destroyed
but
somehow
or
other
they
seem
to
have
managed
to
keep
their
hold
upon
the
masses
of
the
russian
people
and
what
is
much
more
significant
they
have
succeeded
in
creating
a
large
army
which
is
apparently
well
directed
and
well
disciplined
and
is
as
to
a
great
part
of
it
prepared
to
die
for
its
ideals
in
another
year
russia
inspired
by
a
new
enthusiasm
may
have
recovered
from
her
passion
for
peace
and
have
at
her
command
the
only
army
eager
to
fight
because
it
is
the
only
army
that
believes
that
it
has
any
cause
to
fight
for
the
greatest
danger
that
i
see
in
the
present
situation
is
that
germany
may
throw
in
her
lot
with
bolshevism
and
place
her
resources
her
brains
her
vast
organizing
power
at
the
disposal
of
the
revolutionary
fanatics
whose
dream
it
is
to
conquer
the
world
for
bolshevism
by
force
of
arms
this
danger
is
no
mere
chimera
the
present
government
in
germany
is
weak
its
authority
is
challenged
it
lingers
merely
because
there
is
no
alternative
but
the
spartacists
and
germany
is
not
ready
for
spartacism
as
yet
but
the
argument
which
the
spartacists
are
using
with
great
effect
at
this
very
time
is
that
they
alone
can
save
germany
from
the
intolerable
conditions
which
have
been
bequeathed
her
by
the
war
they
offer
to
free
the
german
people
from
indebtedness
to
the
allies
and
indebtedness
to
their
own
richer
classes
they
offer
them
complete
control
of
their
own
affairs
and
the
prospect
of
a
new
heaven
and
earth
it
is
true
that
the
price
will
be
heavy
there
will
be
two
or
three
years
of
anarchy
perhaps
of
bloodshed
but
at
the
end
the
land
will
remain
the
people
will
remain
the
greater
part
of
the
houses
and
the
factories
will
remain
and
the
railways
and
the
roads
will
remain
and
germany
having
thrown
off
her
burdens
will
be
able
to
make
a
fresh
start
if
germany
goes
over
to
the
spartacists
it
is
inevitable
that
she
should
throw
in
her
lot
with
the
russian
bolshevists
once
that
happens
all
eastern
europe
will
be
swept
into
the
orbit
of
the
bolshevik
revolution
and
within
a
year
we
may
witness
the
spectacle
of
nearly
three
hundred
million
people
organized
into
a
vast
red
army
under
german
instructors
and
german
generals
equipped
with
german
cannon
and
german
machine
guns
and
prepared
for
a
renewal
of
the
attack
on
western
europe
this
is
a
prospect
which
no
one
can
face
with
equanimity
yet
the
news
which
came
from
hungary
yesterday
shows
only
too
clearly
that
this
danger
is
no
fantasy
and
what
are
the
reasons
alleged
for
this
decision
they
are
mainly
the
belief
that
large
numbers
of
magyars
are
to
be
handed
over
to
the
control
of
others
if
we
are
wise
we
shall
offer
to
germany
a
peace
which
while
just
will
be
preferable
for
all
sensible
men
to
the
alternative
of
bolshevism
i
would
therefore
put
it
in
the
forefront
of
the
peace
that
once
she
accepts
our
terms
especially
reparation
we
will
open
to
her
the
raw
materials
and
markets
of
the
world
on
equal
terms
with
ourselves
and
will
do
everything
possible
to
enable
the
german
people
to
get
upon
their
legs
again
we
can
not
both
cripple
her
and
expect
her
to
pay
finally
we
must
offer
terms
which
a
responsible
government
in
germany
can
expect
to
be
able
to
carry
out
if
we
present
terms
to
germany
which
are
unjust
or
excessively
onerous
no
responsible
government
will
sign
them
certainly
the
present
weak
administration
will
not
if
it
did
i
am
told
that
it
would
be
swept
away
within
hours
yet
if
we
can
find
nobody
in
germany
who
will
put
his
hand
to
a
peace
treaty
what
will
be
the
position
a
large
army
of
occupation
for
an
indefinite
period
is
out
of
the
question
germany
would
not
mind
it
a
very
large
number
of
people
in
that
country
would
welcome
it
as
it
would
be
the
only
hope
of
preserving
the
existing
order
of
things
the
objection
would
not
come
from
germany
but
from
our
own
countries
neither
the
british
empire
nor
america
would
agree
to
occupy
germany
france
by
itself
could
not
bear
the
burden
of
occupation
we
should
therefore
be
driven
back
on
the
policy
of
blockading
the
country
that
would
inevitably
mean
spartacism
from
the
urals
to
the
rhine
with
its
inevitable
consequence
of
a
huge
red
army
attempting
to
cross
the
rhine
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
am
doubtful
whether
public
opinion
would
allow
us
deliberately
to
starve
germany
if
the
only
difference
between
germany
and
ourselves
were
between
onerous
terms
and
moderate
terms
i
very
much
doubt
if
public
opinion
would
tolerate
the
deliberate
condemnation
of
millions
of
women
and
children
to
death
by
starvation
if
so
the
allies
would
have
incurred
the
moral
defeat
of
having
attempted
to
impose
terms
on
germany
which
germany
had
successfully
resisted
from
every
point
of
view
therefore
it
seems
to
me
that
we
ought
to
endeavour
to
draw
up
a
peace
settlement
as
if
we
were
impartial
arbiters
forgetful
of
the
passions
of
the
war
this
settlement
ought
to
have
three
ends
in
view
first
of
all
it
must
do
justice
to
the
allies
by
taking
into
account
germany
responsibility
for
the
origin
of
the
war
and
for
the
way
in
which
it
was
fought
secondly
it
must
be
a
settlement
which
a
responsible
german
government
can
sign
in
the
belief
that
it
can
fulfil
the
obligations
it
incurs
thirdly
it
must
be
a
settlement
which
will
contain
in
itself
no
provocations
for
future
wars
and
which
will
constitute
an
alternative
to
bolshevism
because
it
will
commend
itself
to
all
reasonable
opinion
as
a
fair
settlement
of
the
european
problem
ii
it
is
not
however
enough
to
draw
up
a
just
and
peace
with
germany
if
we
are
to
offer
europe
an
alternative
to
bolshevism
we
must
make
the
league
of
nations
into
something
which
will
be
both
a
safeguard
to
those
nations
who
are
prepared
for
fair
dealing
with
their
neighbours
and
a
menace
to
those
who
would
trespass
on
the
rights
of
their
neighbours
whether
they
are
imperialist
empires
or
imperialist
bolshevists
an
essential
element
therefore
in
the
peace
settlement
is
the
constitution
of
the
league
of
nations
as
the
effective
guardian
of
international
right
and
international
liberty
throughout
the
world
if
this
is
to
happen
the
first
thing
to
do
is
that
the
leading
members
of
the
league
of
nations
should
arrive
at
an
understanding
between
themselves
in
regard
to
armaments
to
my
mind
it
is
idle
to
endeavour
to
impose
a
permanent
limitation
of
armaments
upon
germany
unless
we
are
prepared
similarly
to
impose
a
limitation
upon
ourselves
i
recognize
that
until
germany
has
settled
down
and
given
practical
proof
that
she
has
abandoned
her
imperialist
ambitions
and
until
russia
has
also
given
proof
that
she
does
not
intend
to
embark
upon
a
military
crusade
against
her
neighbours
it
is
essential
that
the
leading
members
of
the
league
of
nations
should
maintain
considerable
forces
both
by
land
and
sea
in
order
to
preserve
liberty
in
the
world
but
if
they
are
to
present
a
united
front
to
the
forces
both
of
reaction
and
revolution
they
must
arrive
at
such
an
agreement
in
regard
to
armaments
among
themselves
as
would
make
it
impossible
for
suspicion
to
arise
between
the
members
of
the
league
of
nations
in
regard
to
their
intentions
towards
one
another
if
the
league
is
to
do
its
work
for
the
world
it
will
only
be
because
the
members
of
the
league
trust
it
themselves
and
because
there
are
no
rivalries
and
jealousies
in
the
matter
of
armaments
between
them
the
first
condition
of
success
for
the
league
of
nations
is
therefore
a
firm
understanding
between
the
british
empire
and
the
united
states
of
america
and
france
and
italy
that
there
will
be
no
competitive
building
up
of
fleets
or
armies
between
them
unless
this
is
arrived
at
before
the
covenant
is
signed
the
league
of
nations
will
be
a
sham
and
a
mockery
it
will
be
regarded
and
rightly
regarded
as
a
proof
that
its
principal
promoters
and
patrons
repose
no
confidence
in
its
efficacy
but
once
the
leading
members
of
the
league
have
made
it
clear
that
they
have
reached
an
understanding
which
will
both
secure
to
the
league
of
nations
the
strength
which
is
necessary
to
enable
it
to
protect
its
members
and
which
at
the
same
time
will
make
misunderstanding
and
suspicion
with
regard
to
competitive
armaments
impossible
between
them
its
future
and
its
authority
will
be
assured
it
will
then
be
able
to
ensure
as
an
essential
condition
of
peace
that
not
only
germany
but
all
the
smaller
states
of
europe
undertake
to
limit
their
armaments
and
abolish
conscription
if
the
small
nations
are
permitted
to
organize
and
maintain
conscript
armies
running
each
to
hundreds
of
thousands
boundary
wars
will
be
inevitable
and
all
europe
will
be
drawn
in
unless
we
secure
this
universal
limitation
we
shall
achieve
neither
lasting
peace
nor
the
permanent
observance
of
the
limitation
of
german
armaments
which
we
now
seek
to
impose
i
should
like
to
ask
why
germany
if
she
accepts
the
terms
we
consider
just
and
fair
should
not
be
admitted
to
the
league
of
nations
at
any
rate
as
soon
as
she
has
established
a
stable
and
democratic
government
would
it
not
be
an
inducement
to
her
both
to
sign
the
terms
and
to
resist
bolshevism
might
it
not
be
safer
that
she
should
be
inside
the
league
than
that
she
should
be
outside
it
finally
i
believe
that
until
the
authority
and
effectiveness
of
the
league
of
nations
has
been
demonstrated
the
british
empire
and
the
united
states
ought
to
give
france
a
guarantee
against
the
possibility
of
a
new
german
aggression
france
has
special
reason
for
asking
for
such
a
guarantee
she
has
twice
been
attacked
and
twice
invaded
by
germany
in
half
a
century
she
has
been
so
attacked
because
she
has
been
the
principal
guardian
of
liberal
and
democratic
civilization
against
central
european
autocracy
on
the
continent
of
europe
it
is
right
that
the
other
great
western
democracies
should
enter
into
an
undertaking
which
will
ensure
that
they
stand
by
her
side
in
time
to
protect
her
against
invasion
should
germany
ever
threaten
her
again
or
until
the
league
of
nations
has
proved
its
capacity
to
preserve
the
peace
and
liberty
of
the
world
iii
if
however
the
peace
conference
is
really
to
secure
peace
and
prove
to
the
world
a
complete
plan
of
settlement
which
all
reasonable
men
will
recognize
as
an
alternative
preferable
to
anarchy
it
must
deal
with
the
russian
situation
bolshevik
imperialism
does
not
merely
menace
the
states
on
russia
borders
it
threatens
the
whole
of
asia
and
is
as
near
to
america
as
it
is
to
france
it
is
idle
to
think
that
the
peace
conference
can
separate
however
sound
a
peace
it
may
have
arranged
with
germany
if
it
leaves
russia
as
it
is
i
do
not
propose
however
to
complicate
the
question
of
the
peace
with
germany
by
introducing
a
discussion
of
the
russian
problem
i
mention
it
simply
in
order
to
remind
ourselves
of
the
importance
of
dealing
with
it
as
soon
as
possible
the
memorandum
is
followed
by
some
proposals
entitled
general
lines
of
the
peace
conditions
which
would
tend
to
make
the
peace
less
severe
it
is
hardly
worth
while
reproducing
them
as
in
many
points
the
decisions
taken
were
in
the
opposite
sense
it
is
better
not
to
go
beyond
the
general
considerations
lloyd
george
memorandum
is
a
secret
document
but
as
the
english
and
american
press
have
already
printed
long
passages
from
it
it
is
practically
possible
to
give
it
in
its
entirety
without
adding
anything
to
what
has
already
been
printed
tardieu
has
published
clemenceau
reply
drawn
up
by
tardieu
himself
and
representing
the
french
point
of
view
i
the
french
government
is
in
complete
agreement
with
the
general
purpose
of
lloyd
george
note
to
make
a
lasting
peace
and
for
that
reason
a
just
peace
but
on
the
other
hand
it
does
not
think
that
this
principle
which
is
its
own
really
leads
to
the
conclusions
arrived
at
in
the
note
in
question
ii
the
note
suggests
that
the
territorial
conditions
laid
down
for
germany
in
europe
shall
be
moderate
in
order
that
she
may
not
feel
deeply
embittered
after
peace
the
method
would
be
sound
if
the
recent
war
had
been
nothing
but
a
european
war
for
germany
but
that
is
not
the
case
previous
to
the
war
germany
was
a
great
world
power
whose
was
on
the
this
was
the
power
of
which
she
was
so
inordinately
proud
for
the
loss
of
this
world
power
she
will
never
be
consoled
the
allies
have
taken
from
her
or
are
going
to
take
from
her
without
being
deterred
by
fear
of
her
resentment
all
her
colonies
all
her
ships
of
war
a
great
part
of
her
commercial
fleet
as
reparations
the
foreign
markets
which
she
controlled
that
is
the
worst
blow
that
could
be
inflicted
on
her
and
it
is
suggested
that
she
can
be
pacified
by
some
improvements
in
territorial
conditions
that
is
a
pure
illusion
the
remedy
is
not
big
enough
for
the
thing
it
is
to
cure
if
there
is
any
desire
for
general
reasons
to
give
germany
some
satisfaction
it
must
not
be
sought
in
europe
such
help
will
be
vain
as
long
as
germany
has
lost
her
world
policy
to
pacify
her
if
there
is
any
interest
in
so
doing
she
must
have
satisfaction
given
her
in
colonies
in
ships
in
commercial
expansion
the
note
of
march
thinks
of
nothing
but
satisfaction
in
european
territory
iii
lloyd
george
fears
that
unduly
severe
territorial
conditions
imposed
on
germany
will
play
into
the
hands
of
bolshevism
is
there
not
cause
for
fear
on
the
other
hand
that
the
method
he
suggests
will
have
that
very
result
the
conference
has
decided
to
call
into
being
a
certain
number
of
new
states
is
it
possible
without
being
unjust
to
them
to
impose
on
them
inacceptable
frontiers
towards
germany
if
these
people
poland
and
bohemia
above
all
have
resisted
bolshevism
up
to
now
it
is
through
national
sentiment
if
this
sentiment
is
violated
bolshevism
will
find
an
easy
prey
in
them
and
the
only
existing
barrier
between
russian
and
german
bolshevism
will
be
broken
the
result
will
be
either
a
confederation
of
eastern
and
central
europe
under
the
direction
of
a
bolshevik
germany
or
the
enslavery
of
those
countries
to
a
germany
become
reactionary
again
thanks
to
the
general
anarchy
in
either
case
the
allies
will
have
lost
the
war
the
policy
of
the
french
government
on
the
other
hand
is
to
give
the
fullest
aid
to
those
young
peoples
with
the
support
of
everything
liberal
in
europe
and
not
to
try
to
introduce
at
their
expense
abatements
which
in
any
case
would
be
useless
of
the
colonial
naval
and
commercial
disaster
which
the
peace
imposes
on
germany
if
it
is
necessary
in
giving
these
young
peoples
frontiers
without
which
they
can
not
live
to
transfer
under
their
sovereignty
some
germans
sons
of
the
men
who
enslaved
them
we
may
regret
the
necessity
and
we
should
do
it
with
moderation
but
it
can
not
be
avoided
further
when
all
the
german
colonies
are
taken
from
her
entirely
and
definitely
because
she
the
natives
what
right
is
there
to
refuse
normal
frontiers
to
poland
and
bohemia
because
germans
installed
themselves
in
those
countries
as
precursors
of
the
tyrant
iv
the
note
of
march
insists
on
the
necessity
of
a
peace
which
will
appear
to
germany
as
a
just
peace
and
the
french
government
agrees
it
may
be
observed
however
that
given
the
german
mentality
their
conception
of
justice
may
not
be
the
same
as
that
of
the
allies
and
also
surely
the
allies
as
well
as
germany
even
before
germany
should
feel
this
impression
of
justice
the
allies
who
fought
together
should
conclude
the
war
with
a
peace
equal
for
all
now
following
the
method
suggested
in
the
note
of
march
what
will
be
the
result
a
certain
number
of
total
and
definite
guarantees
will
be
given
to
maritime
nations
whose
countries
were
not
invaded
total
and
definite
the
surrender
of
the
german
colonies
total
and
definite
the
surrender
of
the
german
war
fleet
total
and
definite
the
surrender
of
a
large
part
of
the
german
commercial
fleet
total
and
lasting
if
not
definite
the
exclusion
of
germany
from
foreign
markets
for
the
continental
countries
on
the
other
hand
that
is
to
say
for
the
countries
which
have
suffered
most
from
the
war
would
be
reserved
partial
and
transitory
solutions
partial
solution
the
modified
frontiers
suggested
for
poland
and
bohemia
transitory
solution
the
defensive
pledge
offered
france
for
the
protection
of
her
territory
transitory
solution
the
regime
proposed
for
the
saar
coal
there
is
an
evident
inequality
which
might
have
a
bad
influence
on
the
relations
among
the
allies
more
important
than
the
relations
of
germany
with
them
it
has
been
shown
in
paragraph
i
that
it
would
be
an
illusion
to
hope
that
territorial
satisfaction
offered
to
germany
would
compensate
her
sufficiently
for
the
world
disaster
she
has
suffered
and
it
may
surely
be
added
that
it
would
be
an
injustice
to
lay
the
burden
of
such
compensation
on
the
shoulders
of
those
countries
among
the
allies
which
have
had
to
bear
the
heaviest
burden
of
the
war
after
the
burdens
of
the
war
these
countries
can
not
bear
the
burdens
of
the
peace
it
is
essential
that
they
should
feel
that
the
peace
is
just
and
equal
for
all
and
unless
that
be
assured
it
is
not
only
in
central
europe
that
there
will
be
fear
of
bolshevism
for
nowhere
does
it
propagate
so
easily
as
has
been
seen
as
amid
national
disillusionment
v
the
french
government
desires
to
limit
itself
for
the
moment
to
these
observations
of
a
general
character
it
pays
full
homage
to
the
intentions
which
inspired
lloyd
george
memorandum
but
it
considers
that
the
inductions
that
can
be
drawn
from
the
present
note
are
in
consonance
with
justice
and
the
general
interests
and
those
are
the
considerations
by
which
the
french
government
will
be
inspired
in
the
coming
exchange
of
ideas
for
the
discussion
of
conditions
suggested
by
the
prime
minister
of
great
britain
these
two
documents
are
of
more
than
usual
interest
the
british
prime
minister
with
his
remarkable
insight
at
once
notes
the
seriousness
of
the
situation
he
sees
the
danger
to
the
peace
of
the
world
in
german
depression
germany
oppressed
does
not
mean
germany
subjected
every
year
france
becomes
numerically
weaker
germany
stronger
the
horrors
of
war
will
be
forgotten
and
the
maintenance
of
peace
will
depend
on
the
creation
of
a
situation
which
makes
life
possible
does
not
cause
exasperation
to
come
into
public
feeling
or
into
the
just
claims
of
germans
desirous
of
independence
injustice
in
the
hour
of
triumph
will
never
be
pardoned
can
never
be
atoned
so
the
idea
of
handing
over
to
other
states
numbers
of
germans
is
not
only
an
injustice
but
a
cause
of
future
wars
and
what
can
be
said
of
germans
is
also
true
of
magyars
no
cause
of
future
wars
must
be
allowed
to
remain
putting
millions
of
germans
under
polish
rule
that
is
under
an
inferior
people
which
has
never
shown
any
capacity
for
stable
must
lead
to
a
new
war
sooner
or
later
if
germany
in
exasperation
became
a
country
of
revolution
what
would
happen
to
europe
you
can
impose
severe
conditions
but
that
does
not
mean
that
you
can
enforce
them
the
conditions
to
be
imposed
must
be
such
that
a
responsible
german
government
can
in
good
faith
assume
the
obligation
of
carrying
them
out
neither
great
britain
nor
the
united
states
of
america
can
assume
the
obligation
of
occupying
germany
if
it
does
not
carry
out
the
excessively
severe
conditions
which
it
is
desired
to
impose
can
france
occupy
germany
alone
from
that
moment
lloyd
george
saw
the
necessity
of
admitting
germany
into
the
league
of
nations
and
proposed
a
scheme
of
treaty
containing
conditions
which
while
very
severe
were
in
part
tolerable
for
the
german
people
clemenceau
reply
issued
a
few
days
later
contains
the
french
point
of
view
and
has
an
ironical
note
when
it
touches
on
the
weak
points
in
lloyd
george
argument
the
war
says
the
french
note
was
not
a
european
war
germany
eyes
were
fixed
on
world
power
and
she
saw
that
her
future
was
on
the
sea
there
is
no
necessity
to
show
consideration
regarding
territorial
conditions
in
europe
by
taking
away
her
commercial
fleet
her
colonies
and
her
foreign
markets
more
harm
is
done
to
germany
than
by
taking
european
territory
to
pacify
her
if
there
is
any
occasion
for
doing
so
she
must
be
offered
commercial
satisfaction
at
this
point
the
note
in
considering
questions
of
justice
and
of
mere
utility
becomes
distinctly
ironical
having
decided
to
bring
to
life
new
states
especially
poland
and
why
not
give
them
safe
frontiers
even
if
some
germans
or
magyars
have
to
be
sacrificed
one
of
clemenceau
fixed
ideas
is
that
criterions
of
justice
must
not
be
applied
to
germans
the
note
says
explicitly
that
given
the
german
mentality
it
is
by
no
means
sure
that
the
conception
of
justice
of
germany
will
be
the
same
as
that
of
the
allies
on
another
occasion
after
the
signing
of
the
treaty
when
lloyd
george
pointed
out
the
wisdom
of
not
claiming
from
germany
the
absurdity
of
handing
over
thousands
of
officers
accused
of
cruelty
for
judgment
by
their
late
enemies
and
recognized
frankly
the
impossibility
of
carrying
out
such
a
stipulation
in
england
clemenceau
replied
simply
that
the
germans
are
not
like
the
english
the
delicate
point
in
clemenceau
note
is
the
contradiction
in
which
he
tries
to
involve
the
british
prime
minister
between
the
clauses
of
the
treaty
concerning
germany
outside
europe
in
which
no
moderation
had
been
shown
and
those
regarding
germany
in
europe
in
which
he
himself
did
not
consider
moderation
either
necessary
or
opportune
there
was
an
evident
divergence
of
views
clearing
the
way
for
a
calm
review
of
the
conditions
to
be
imposed
and
here
two
countries
could
have
exercised
decisive
action
the
united
states
and
italy
but
the
united
states
was
represented
by
wilson
who
was
already
in
a
difficult
situation
by
successive
concessions
the
gravity
of
which
he
had
not
realized
he
found
himself
confronted
by
drafts
of
treaties
which
in
the
end
were
contradictions
of
all
his
proposals
the
absolute
antithesis
of
the
pledges
he
had
given
it
is
quite
possible
that
he
had
not
seen
where
he
was
going
but
his
frequent
irritation
was
the
sign
of
his
distress
still
in
the
of
his
whole
programme
he
had
succeeded
in
saving
one
thing
the
statute
of
the
league
of
nations
which
was
to
be
prefaced
to
all
the
treaties
he
wanted
to
go
back
to
america
and
meet
the
senate
with
at
least
something
to
show
as
a
record
of
the
great
undertaking
and
he
hoped
and
believed
in
good
faith
that
the
covenant
of
the
league
of
nations
would
sooner
or
later
have
brought
about
agreement
and
modified
the
worst
of
the
mistakes
made
his
conception
of
things
was
academic
and
he
had
not
realized
that
there
was
need
to
constitute
the
nations
before
laying
down
rules
for
the
league
he
trusted
that
bringing
them
together
with
mutual
pledges
would
further
most
efficiently
the
cause
of
peace
among
the
peoples
on
the
other
hand
there
was
diffidence
shared
by
both
between
wilson
and
lloyd
george
and
there
was
little
likelihood
of
the
british
prime
minister
move
checking
the
course
the
conference
had
taken
italy
might
have
done
a
great
work
if
its
representatives
had
had
a
clear
policy
but
as
tardieu
says
they
had
no
share
in
the
effective
doings
of
the
conference
and
their
activity
was
almost
entirely
absorbed
in
the
question
of
fiume
the
conference
was
a
conversation
between
wilson
clemenceau
and
lloyd
george
and
the
latter
had
hostility
and
diffidence
on
each
side
of
him
with
italy
as
earlier
stated
for
the
most
part
absent
also
it
was
just
then
that
the
divergence
between
wilson
and
the
italian
representatives
reached
its
acute
stage
the
essential
parts
of
the
treaty
were
decided
in
april
and
the
beginning
of
may
on
april
the
question
of
the
right
bank
of
the
rhine
on
the
or
the
agreement
about
reparations
italy
was
absent
and
when
the
italian
delegates
returned
to
paris
without
being
asked
on
may
the
text
of
the
treaty
was
complete
in
print
in
actual
fact
only
one
person
did
really
effective
work
and
directed
the
trend
of
the
conference
and
that
person
was
clemenceau
the
fact
that
the
conference
met
in
paris
that
everything
that
was
done
by
the
various
delegations
was
known
even
foreseen
so
that
it
could
be
opposed
discredited
even
destroyed
by
the
press
beforehand
a
thing
which
annoyed
lloyd
george
so
much
that
at
one
time
he
thought
seriously
of
leaving
the
conference
all
this
gave
an
enormous
advantage
to
the
french
delegation
and
especially
to
clemenceau
who
directed
the
conference
work
all
his
life
clemenceau
has
been
a
tremendous
destroyer
for
years
and
years
he
has
done
nothing
but
overthrow
governments
with
a
sort
of
obstinate
ferocity
he
was
an
old
man
when
he
was
called
to
lead
the
country
but
he
brought
with
him
all
his
fighting
spirit
no
one
detests
the
church
and
detests
socialism
more
than
he
both
of
these
moral
forces
are
equally
repulsive
to
his
individualistic
spirit
i
do
not
think
there
is
any
man
among
the
politicians
i
have
known
who
is
more
individualistic
than
clemenceau
who
remains
the
man
of
the
old
democracy
in
time
of
war
no
one
was
better
fitted
than
he
to
lead
a
fighting
ministry
fighting
at
home
fighting
abroad
with
the
same
feeling
the
same
passion
when
there
was
one
thing
only
necessary
in
order
to
beat
the
enemy
never
to
falter
in
hatred
never
to
doubt
the
sureness
of
victory
no
one
came
near
him
no
one
could
be
more
determined
no
one
more
bitter
but
when
war
was
over
when
it
was
peace
that
had
to
be
ensured
no
one
could
be
less
fitted
for
the
work
he
saw
nothing
beyond
his
hatred
for
germany
the
necessity
for
destroying
the
enemy
sweeping
away
every
bit
of
his
activity
bringing
him
into
subjection
on
account
of
his
age
he
could
not
visualize
the
problems
of
the
future
he
could
only
see
one
thing
necessary
and
that
was
immediate
to
destroy
the
enemy
and
either
destroy
or
confiscate
all
his
means
of
development
he
was
not
nationalist
or
imperialist
like
his
collaborators
but
before
all
and
above
all
one
idea
lived
in
him
hatred
for
germany
she
must
be
rendered
barren
disembowelled
annihilated
he
had
said
in
the
french
parliament
that
treaties
of
peace
were
nothing
more
than
a
way
of
going
on
with
war
and
in
september
in
his
preface
to
tardieu
book
he
said
that
france
must
get
reparation
for
waterloo
and
sedan
even
waterloo
et
sedan
pour
ne
pas
remonter
plus
haut
nous
imposaient
les
douloureux
soucis
politique
de
tardieu
noted
as
we
have
seen
that
there
were
only
three
people
in
the
conference
wilson
clemenceau
and
lloyd
george
orlando
he
remarks
spoke
little
and
italy
had
no
importance
with
subtle
irony
he
notes
that
wilson
talked
like
a
university
don
criticizing
an
essay
with
the
didactic
logic
of
the
professor
the
truth
is
that
after
having
made
the
mistake
of
staying
in
the
conference
he
did
not
see
that
his
whole
edifice
was
tumbling
down
and
he
let
mistakes
accumulate
one
after
the
other
with
the
result
that
treaties
were
framed
which
as
already
pointed
out
actually
destroyed
all
the
principles
he
had
declared
to
the
world
things
being
as
they
were
in
paris
clemenceau
temperament
the
pressure
of
french
industry
and
of
the
newspapers
the
real
anxiety
to
make
the
future
safe
and
the
desire
on
that
account
to
exterminate
the
enemy
france
naturally
demanded
through
its
representatives
the
severest
sanctions
england
given
the
realistic
nature
of
its
representatives
and
the
calm
clear
vision
of
lloyd
george
always
favoured
in
general
the
more
moderate
solutions
as
those
which
were
more
likely
to
be
carried
out
and
would
least
disturb
the
equilibrium
of
europe
so
it
came
about
that
the
decisions
seemed
to
be
a
compromise
but
were
on
the
other
hand
actually
so
hard
and
so
stern
that
they
were
impossible
of
execution
without
committing
any
indiscretion
it
is
possible
to
see
now
from
the
publications
of
the
french
representatives
at
the
conference
themselves
what
france
claims
were
let
us
try
to
sum
them
up
as
regards
disarmament
and
control
there
could
have
been
and
there
ought
to
have
been
no
difficulty
about
agreement
i
am
in
favour
of
the
reduction
of
all
armaments
but
i
regard
it
as
a
perfectly
legitimate
claim
that
the
country
principally
responsible
for
the
war
and
in
general
the
conquered
countries
should
be
obliged
to
disarm
no
one
would
regard
it
as
unfair
that
germany
and
the
conquered
countries
should
be
compelled
to
reduce
their
armaments
to
the
measure
necessary
to
guarantee
internal
order
only
but
a
distinction
must
be
drawn
between
military
sanctions
meant
to
guarantee
peace
and
those
which
have
the
end
of
ruining
the
enemy
in
actual
truth
in
his
solemn
pronouncements
after
the
entry
of
the
united
states
into
the
war
president
wilson
had
never
spoken
of
a
separate
disarmament
of
the
conquered
countries
but
of
adequate
guarantees
and
that
national
armaments
should
be
reduced
to
the
smallest
point
compatible
with
internal
order
assurances
given
and
received
that
is
to
say
an
identical
situation
as
between
conquerors
and
conquered
no
one
can
deny
the
right
of
the
conqueror
to
compel
the
conquered
enemy
to
give
up
his
arms
and
reduce
his
military
armaments
at
any
rate
for
some
time
but
on
this
point
too
there
was
useless
excess
i
should
never
have
thought
of
publishing
france
claims
bitterness
comes
that
way
responsibility
is
incurred
in
future
it
may
be
an
argument
in
your
adversary
hands
but
tardieu
has
taken
this
office
on
himself
and
has
told
us
all
france
did
recounting
her
claims
from
the
acts
of
the
conference
itself
reference
is
easy
to
the
story
written
by
one
of
the
representatives
of
france
possibly
the
most
efficient
through
having
been
in
america
a
long
time
and
having
fuller
and
more
intimate
knowledge
of
the
american
representatives
particularly
colonel
house
generally
speaking
in
every
claim
the
french
representatives
started
from
an
extreme
position
and
that
was
not
only
a
state
of
mind
it
was
a
tactical
measure
later
on
if
they
gave
up
any
part
of
their
claim
they
had
the
air
of
yielding
of
accepting
a
compromise
when
their
claims
were
of
such
an
extreme
nature
that
the
anxiety
they
caused
the
opposition
they
raised
was
evident
clemenceau
put
on
an
air
of
moderation
and
gave
way
at
once
sometimes
too
he
showed
moderation
himself
when
it
suited
his
purpose
but
in
reality
he
only
gave
way
when
he
saw
that
it
was
impossible
to
get
what
he
wanted
in
points
where
english
and
american
interests
were
not
involved
given
the
difficult
position
in
which
lloyd
george
was
placed
and
wilson
utter
ignorance
of
all
european
questions
with
italy
keeping
almost
entirely
apart
the
french
point
of
view
always
came
out
on
top
if
slightly
modified
but
the
original
claim
was
always
so
extreme
that
the
modification
left
standing
the
most
radically
severe
measure
against
the
conquered
countries
many
decisions
affecting
france
were
not
sufficiently
criticized
on
account
of
the
relations
in
which
the
english
and
americans
stood
to
france
objections
would
have
looked
like
pleading
the
enemy
cause
previously
in
nearly
every
case
when
peace
was
being
made
the
representatives
of
the
conquered
countries
had
been
called
to
state
their
case
opportunity
was
given
for
discussion
the
peace
is
an
example
undoubtedly
the
aggression
of
russia
had
been
unscrupulous
and
premeditated
but
both
parties
participated
in
drawing
up
the
peace
treaty
at
paris
possibly
for
the
first
time
in
history
the
destiny
of
the
most
cultured
people
in
europe
was
decided
or
rather
it
was
thought
that
it
was
being
decided
without
even
listening
to
what
they
had
to
say
and
without
hearing
from
their
representatives
if
the
conditions
imposed
could
or
could
not
possibly
be
carried
out
later
on
an
exception
if
only
a
purely
formal
one
was
made
in
the
case
of
hungary
whose
delegates
were
heard
but
it
will
remain
for
ever
a
terrible
precedent
in
modern
history
that
against
all
pledges
all
precedents
and
all
traditions
the
representatives
of
germany
were
never
even
heard
nothing
was
left
to
them
but
to
sign
a
treaty
at
a
moment
when
famine
and
exhaustion
and
threat
of
revolution
made
it
impossible
not
to
sign
it
if
germany
had
not
signed
she
would
have
suffered
less
loss
but
at
that
time
conditions
at
home
with
latent
revolution
threatening
the
whole
empire
made
it
imperative
to
accept
any
solution
and
all
the
more
as
the
germans
considered
that
they
were
not
bound
by
their
signature
the
decisions
having
been
imposed
by
violence
without
any
hearing
being
given
to
the
conquered
party
and
the
most
serious
decisions
being
taken
without
any
real
examination
of
the
facts
in
the
old
law
of
the
church
it
was
laid
down
that
everyone
must
have
a
hearing
even
the
devil
diabulus
even
the
devil
has
the
right
to
be
heard
but
the
new
democracy
which
proposed
to
install
the
society
of
the
nations
did
not
even
obey
the
precepts
which
the
dark
middle
ages
held
sacred
on
behalf
of
the
accused
conditions
in
germany
were
terribly
difficult
and
an
army
of
two
hundred
thousand
men
was
considered
by
the
military
experts
the
minimum
necessary
the
military
commission
presided
over
by
marshal
foch
left
germany
an
army
of
two
hundred
thousand
men
recruited
by
conscription
a
staff
in
proportion
service
of
one
year
fifteen
divisions
heavy
guns
that
is
less
than
what
little
states
without
any
resources
have
now
three
years
after
the
close
of
the
war
but
france
at
once
imposed
the
reduction
of
the
german
army
to
men
no
conscription
but
a
twelve
service
of
paid
soldiers
artillery
reduced
practically
to
nothing
no
heavy
guns
at
all
very
few
no
opportunity
was
given
for
discussion
nor
was
there
any
clemenceau
put
the
problem
in
such
a
way
that
discussion
was
out
of
the
question

lloyd
george
and
colonel
house
confined
themselves
to
saying
that
on
this
point
france
formally
expressed
their
views
great
britain
and
the
united
states
had
no
right
to
oppose
lloyd
george
was
convinced
that
the
measures
were
too
extreme
and
had
tried
on
may
to
modify
them
but
france
insisted
on
imposing
on
germany
this
situation
of
tremendous
difficulty
i
have
referred
to
the
military
conditions
imposed
on
germany
destruction
of
all
war
material
fortresses
and
armament
factories
prohibition
of
any
trade
in
arms
destruction
of
the

occupation
of
the
west
bank
of
the

and
the
bridgeheads
for
fifteen
years
allied
control
with
wide
powers
over
the
execution
of
the
military
and
naval
clauses
of
the
treaty
with
consequent
subjection
of
all
public
administrations
and
private
companies
to
the
will
of
a
foreigner
or
rather
of
an
enemy
kept
at
the
expense
of
germany
itself
and
at
no
small
expense
etc
in
some
of
the
conferences
i
have
had
to
take
note
of
what
these
commissions
of
control
really
are
and
their
absurd
extravagance
based
on
the
argument
that
the
enemy
must
pay
for
everything
the
purport
of
france
action
in
the
conference
was
not
to
ensure
safe
military
guarantees
against
germany
but
to
destroy
her
at
any
rate
to
cut
her
up
and
indeed
when
she
had
got
all
she
wanted
and
germany
was
helpless
she
continued
the
same
policy
even
intensifying
it
every
bit
of
territory
possible
must
be
taken
german
unity
must
be
broken
and
not
only
military
but
industrial
germany
must
be
laid
low
under
a
series
of
controls
and
an
impossible
number
of
obligations
all
know
how
in
article
of
the
treaty
it
is
laid
down
as
a
guarantee
of
the
execution
of
the
treaty
terms
on
the
part
of
germany
or
rather
as
a
more
extended
military
guarantee
for
france
that
german
territory
on
the
west
bank
of
the
rhine
and
the
bridgeheads
are
to
be
occupied
by
allied
and
associated
troops
for
fifteen
years
methods
and
regulations
for
such
occupation
following
in
articles
and
this
occupation
not
only
gives
deep
offence
to
germany
france
has
always
looked
back
with
implacable
bitterness
on
the
few
military
occupation
by
her
prussian
conquerors
in
the
war
of
but
it
paralyses
all
her
activity
and
is
generally
judged
to
be
completely
useless
all
the
allies
were
ready
to
give
france
every
military
guarantee
against
any
unjust
aggression
by
germany
but
france
wanted
in
addition
the
occupation
of
the
left
bank
of
the
rhine
it
was
a
very
delicate
matter
and
the
notes
presented
to
the
conference
by
great
britain
on
march
and
april
by
the
united
states
on
march
and
april
show
how
embarrassed
the
two
governments
were
in
considering
a
question
which
france
regarded
as
essential
for
her
future
it
has
to
be
added
that
the
action
of
marshal
foch
in
this
matter
was
not
entirely
constitutional
he
claimed
that
independently
of
nationality
france
and
belgium
have
the
right
to
look
on
the
rhine
as
the
indispensable
frontier
for
the
nations
of
the
west
of
europe
par
l√†
de
la
neither
lloyd
george
nor
wilson
could
swallow
the
argument
of
the
rhine
a
frontier
between
the
civilization
of
france
and
belgium
all
civilization
indeed
and
germany
in
the
treaty
the
occupation
of
the
left
bank
of
the
rhine
and
the
bridgeheads
by
the
allied
and
associated
powers
for
fifteen
years
was
introduced
as
a
compromise
such
districts
will
be
evacuated
by
degrees
every
five
years
if
germany
shall
have
faithfully
carried
out
the
terms
of
the
treaty
now
the
conditions
of
the
treaty
are
in
large
measure
impossible
of
execution
and
in
consequence
no
execution
of
them
can
ever
be
described
as
faithful
further
the
occupying
troops
are
paid
by
germany
it
follows
that
the
conception
of
the
occupation
of
the
left
bank
of
the
rhine
was
of
a
fact
of
unlimited
duration
the
harm
that
would
result
from
the
occupation
was
pointed
out
at
the
conference
by
the
american
representatives
and
even
more
strongly
by
the
english
what
was
the
use
of
it
they
asked
if
the
german
army
were
reduced
to
men
tardieu
himself
tells
the
story
of
all
the
efforts
made
especially
by
lloyd
george
and
bonar
law
to
prevent
the
blunder
which
later
on
was
endorsed
in
the
treaty
as
article
lloyd
george
went
so
far
as
to
complain
of
political
intrigues
for
creating
disorder
on
the
rhine
but
clemenceau
took
care
to
put
the
question
in
such
a
form
that
no
discussion
was
possible
in
the
matter
of
the
occupation
he
said
to
the
english
you
do
not
understand
the
french
point
of
view
you
live
in
an
island
with
the
sea
as
defence
we
on
the
continent
with
a
bad
frontier
we
do
not
look
for
an
attack
by
germany
but
for
systematic
refusal
to
carry
out
the
terms
of
the
treaty
never
was
there
a
treaty
with
so
many
clauses
with
consequently
so
many
opportunities
for
evasion
against
that
risk
the
material
guarantee
of
occupation
is
necessary
there
are
two
methods
in
direct
contrast

and

had
offered
france
the
fullest
military
guarantee
in
place
of
the
occupation
of
the
left
bank
of
the
rhine
france
wanted
and
in
fact
got
the
occupation
as
well
as
the
alliances
says
tardieu
la

outside
the
versailles
treaty
the
united
states
and
great
britain
had
made
several
treaties
of
alliance
with
france
for
the
event
of
unprovoked
aggression
by
germany
later
on
the
treaty
was
approved
by
the
house
of
commons
the
underwent
the
same
fate
as
the
versailles
treaty
but
the
treaty
with
great
britain
fell
through
also
on
account
of
the
provision
that
it
should
come
into
force
simultaneously
with
the
american
treaty
in
a
paris
newspaper
poincar√©
published
in
september
some
strictly
reserved
documents
on
the
questions
of
the
military
guarantees
and
the
occupation
of
the
left
bank
of
the
rhine
he
wished
to
get
the
credit
of
having
stood
firm
when
clemenceau
himself
hesitated
at
the
demand
for
an
occupation
of
the

even
a
longer
period
than
fifteen
years
he
has
published
the
letter
he
sent
to
clemenceau
to
be
shown
to
wilson
and
lloyd
george
and
the
latter
reply
he
said
that
there
must
be
no
thought
of
giving
up
the
occupation
and
renouncing
a
guarantee
until
every
obligation
in
the
treaty
should
have
been
carried
out
he
went
so
far
as
to
claim
that
in
occupation
regarded
as
a
guarantee
of
a
credit
representing
an
indemnity
for
damages
there
is
nothing
contrary
to
the
principles
proclaimed
by
president
wilson
and
recognized
by
the
allies
nor
would
it
suffice
even
to
have
the
faculty
of
reoccupation
because
this
faculty
could
never
be
a
valid
substitute
for
occupation
as
regards
the
suggestion
that
a
long
occupation
or
one
for
an
indeterminate
period
would
cause
bad
feeling
poincar√©
was
convinced
that
this
was
an
exaggeration
a
short
occupation
causes
more
irritation
on
account
of
its
arbitrary
limit
everyone
understands
an
occupation
without
other
limit
than
the
complete
carrying
out
of
the
treaty
the
longer
the
time
that
passes
the
better
would
become
the
relations
between
the
german
populations
and
the
armies
of
occupation
clemenceau
communicated
poincar√©
letter
to
lloyd
george
the
british
prime
minister
replied
on
may
in
the
clearest
terms
in
his
eyes
forcing
germany
to
submit
to
the
occupation
of
the
rhine
and
the
rhine
provinces
for
an
unlimited
period
was
a
provocation
to
renew
the
war
in
europe
during
the
conference
france
put
forward
some
proposals
the
aim
of
which
was
nothing
less
than
to
split
up
germany
a
typical
example
is
the
memorandum
presented
by
the
french
delegation
claiming
the
annexation
of
the
saar
territory
this
is
completely
german
in
the
six
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
inhabitants
before
the
war
there
were
not
a
hundred
french
not
a
word
had
ever
been
said
about
annexation
of
the
saar
either
in
government
pronouncements
or
in
any
vote
in
the
french
parliament
nor
had
it
been
discussed
by
any
political
party
no
one
had
ever
suggested
such
annexation
which
certainly
was
a
far
more
serious
thing
than
the
annexation
of
to
germany
as
there
was
considerable
german
population
in
there
was
no
french
population
at
all
in
the
saar
and
the
territory
in
question
could
not
even
be
claimed
for
military
reasons
but
only
for
its
economic
resources
reasons
of
history
could
not
count
for
they
were
all
in
germany
favour
nevertheless
the
request
was
put
forward
as
a
matter
of
sentiment
had
not
the
saar
belonged
in
other
days
entirely
or
in
part
to
france
politics
and
economics
are
not
everything
said
clemenceau
history
also
has
great
value
for
the
united
states
a
hundred
and
twenty
years
are
a
long
time
for
france
they
count
little
material
reparations
are
not
enough
there
must
be
moral
reparations
too
and
the
conception
of
france
can
not
be
the
same
as
that
of
her
allies
the
desire
for
the
saar
responded
according
to
clemenceau
to
a
need
of
moral
reparation
on
this
point
too
the
extreme
french
claim
was
modified
the
saar
mines
were
given
to
france
not
provisionally
as
a
matter
of
reparations
but
permanently
with
full
right
of
possession
and
full
guarantees
for
their
working
for
fifteen
years
from
the
date
of
the
treaty
the
government
of
the
territory
was
put
in
the
hands
of
the
league
of
nations
as
trustee
after
fifteen
years
the
population
entirely
german
should
be
called
to
decide
under
what
government
they
desired
to
live
in
other
words
in
a
purely
german
country
which
no
one
in
france
had
ever
claimed
of
which
no
one
in
france
had
ever
spoken
during
the
war
the
most
important
property
was
handed
to
a
conquering
state
the
country
was
put
under
the
administration
of
the
conquerors
which
is
what
the
league
of
nations
actually
is
at
present
and
after
fifteen
years
of
torment
the
population
is
to
be
put
through
a
plebiscite
meanwhile
the
french
douane
rules
in
the
saar
it
was
open
to
the
treaty
to
adopt
or
not
to
adopt
the
system
of
plebiscites
when
it
was
a
case
of
handing
over
great
masses
of
german
populations
a
plebiscite
was
imperative
at
any
rate
where
any
doubt
existed
and
the
more
so
in
concessions
which
formed
no
part
of
the
war
aims
and
were
not
found
in
any
pronouncement
of
the
allies
on
the
other
hand
in
all
cessions
of
german
territory
to
poland
and
bohemia
no
mention
is
made
of
a
plebiscite
because
it
was
a
question
of
military
necessity
or
of
lands
which
had
been
historically
victims
of
germany
but
only
for
schleswig
upper
silesia
marienwerder
allenstein
klagenfurth
and
the
saar
were
plebiscites
laid
down
and
with
the
exception
that
the
plebiscite
itself
when
as
in
the
case
of
upper
silesia
it
resulted
in
favour
of
germany
was
not
regarded
as
conclusive
but
where
the
most
extreme
views
clashed
was
in
the
matter
of
reparations
and
the
indemnity
to
be
claimed
from
the
enemy
we
have
already
seen
that
the
theory
of
reparation
for
damage
found
its
way
incidentally
even
before
the
treaty
was
considered
into
the
armistice
terms
no
word
had
been
said
previously
of
claiming
from
the
conquered
enemy
anything
beyond
restoration
of
devastated
territories
but
after
the
war
another
theory
was
produced
if
germany
and
her
allies
are
solely
responsible
for
the
war
they
must
pay
the
whole
cost
of
the
war
damage
to
property
persons
and
war
works
when
damage
has
been
done
he
who
has
done
the
wrong
must
make
reparation
for
it
to
the
utmost
limit
of
his
resources
the
american
delegation
struck
a
note
of
moderation
no
claim
should
be
made
beyond
what
was
established
in
the
peace
conditions
reparation
for
actions
which
were
an
evident
violation
of
international
law
restoration
of
invaded
country
and
reparation
for
damage
caused
to
the
civil
population
and
to
its
property
during
the
war
there
were
a
number
of
exaggerated
pronouncements
on
the
immense
resources
of
germany
and
her
capacity
for
payment
besides
all
the
burdens
with
which
germany
was
loaded
there
was
a
discussion
on
the
sum
which
the
allies
should
claim
the
war
had
cost
milliard
francs
and
the
claims
for
damage
to
persons
and
property
amounted
to
at
least
milliards
for
all
the
allies
together
whatever
the
sum
might
be
when
it
had
been
laid
down
in
the
treaty
what
damage
was
to
be
indemnified
the
french
negotiators
claimed
per
leaving
per
cent
for
all
the
others
what
was
necessary
was
to
lay
down
proportions
not
the
actual
amount
of
the
sum
it
was
impossible
to
say
at
once
what
amount
the
damages
would
reach
that
was
the
business
of
the
reparations
commission
instead
of
inserting
in
the
treaty
the
enormous
figures
spoken
of
the
quality
not
the
quantity
of
the
damages
to
be
indemnified
was
laid
down
but
the
standard
of
reckoning
led
to
fantastic
figures
an
impossible
amount
had
to
be
paid
and
the
delegations
were
discussing
then
the
very
same
things
that
are
being
discussed
now
the
american
experts
saw
the
gross
mistake
of
the
other
delegations
and
put
down
as
the
maximum
payment
milliard
marks
up
to
the
first
payment
to
be
milliard
marks
in
so
was
invented
the
reparations
commission
machine
a
thing
which
has
no
precedent
in
any
treaty
being
a
commission
with
sovereign
powers
to
control
the
life
of
the
whole
of
germany
in
actual
truth
no
serious
person
has
ever
thought
that
germany
can
pay
more
than
a
certain
number
of
milliards
a
year
no
one
believes
that
a
country
can
be
subjected
to
a
regime
of
control
for
thirty
years
but
the
directing
line
of
work
of
the
treaties
has
been
to
break
down
germany
to
cut
her
up
to
suffocate
her
france
had
but
one
idea
and
later
on
did
not
hesitate
to
admit
it
to
dismember
germany
to
destroy
her
unity
by
creating
intolerable
conditions
of
life
taking
away
territory
on
the
frontier
putting
large
districts
under
military
occupation
delaying
or
not
making
any
diplomatic
appointments
and
carrying
on
communications
solely
through
military
commissions
a
state
of
things
was
brought
about
which
must
inevitably
tend
to
weaken
the
constitutional
unity
of
the
german
empire
taking
away
from
germany
thousand
kilometres
of
territory
nearly
eight
million
inhabitants
and
all
the
most
important
mineral
resources
preventing
the
unity
of
the
german
people
and
the
six
million
and
five
hundred
thousand
of
german
austrians
to
which
austria
was
then
reduced
putting
the
whole
german
country
under
an
interminable
series
of
controls
all
this
did
more
harm
to
german
unity
than
would
have
been
done
by
taking
the
responsibility
of
a
forcible
and
immediate
division
to
which
the
germans
could
not
have
consented
and
which
the
allies
could
not
have
claimed
to
impose
what
has
been
said
about
germany
and
the
versailles
treaty
can
be
said
about
all
the
other
conquered
countries
and
all
the
other
treaties
with
merely
varying
proportions
in
each
case
the
verdict
that
has
to
be
passed
on
them
will
very
soon
be
shown
by
facts
if
indeed
facts
have
not
shown
already
that
in
great
measure
what
had
been
laid
down
can
not
be
carried
out
one
thing
is
certain
that
the
actual
treaties
threaten
to
ruin
conquerors
and
conquered
that
they
have
not
brought
peace
to
europe
but
conditions
of
war
and
violence
in
clemenceau
words
the
treaties
are
a
way
of
going
on
with
war
but
even
if
it
were
possible
to
dispute
that
as
men
minds
can
not
yet
frame
an
impartial
judgment
and
the
danger
is
not
seen
by
all
there
is
one
thing
that
can
not
be
denied
or
disputed
and
that
is
that
the
treaties
are
the
negation
of
the
principles
for
which
the
united
states
and
italy
without
any
obligation
on
them
entered
the
war
they
are
a
perversion
of
all
the
entente
had
repeatedly
proclaimed
they
break
into
pieces
president
wilson
fourteen
points
which
were
a
solemn
pledge
for
the
american
people
and
they
will
be
the
greatest
moral
weapon
with
which
the
conquered
of
will
face
the
conquerors
of
iv
the
conquerors
and
the
conquered
how
many
are
the
states
of
europe
before
the
war
the
political
geography
of
europe
was
almost
tradition
every
part
of
europe
is
in
a
state
of
flux
the
only
absolute
certainty
is
that
in
continental
europe
conquerors
and
conquered
are
in
a
condition
of
spiritual
as
well
as
economic
unrest
it
is
difficult
indeed
to
say
how
many
political
unities
there
are
and
how
many
are
lasting
and
what
new
wars
are
being
prepared
if
a
way
of
salvation
is
not
found
by
some
common
endeavour
to
install
peace
which
the
peace
of
paris
has
not
done
how
many
thinking
men
can
without
perplexity
remember
how
many
states
there
are
and
what
they
are
arbitrary
creations
of
the
treaties
creations
of
the
moment
territorial
limitations
imposed
by
the
necessities
of
international
agreements
the
situation
of
russia
is
so
uncertain
that
no
one
knows
whether
new
states
will
arise
as
a
result
of
her
continuous
disintegration
or
if
she
will
be
reconstructed
in
a
solid
unified
form
and
other
states
amongst
those
which
have
arisen
will
fall
without
taking
into
account
those
traditional
little
states
which
are
merely
historical
curiosities
as
monaco
san
marino
andorra
monte
santo
not
counting
iceland
as
a
state
apart
not
including
the
saar
which
as
a
result
of
one
of
the
absurdities
of
the
treaty
of
versailles
is
an
actual
state
outside
germany
but
considering
montenegro
as
an
existing
state
europe
probably
comprises
thirty
states
some
of
them
are
however
in
such
a
condition
that
they
do
not
give
promise
of
the
slightest
guarantee
of
life
or
security
europe
has
rather
balkanized
herself
not
only
the
war
came
from
the
balkans
but
also
many
ideas
which
have
been
largely
exploited
in
parliamentary
and
newspaper
circles
listening
to
many
speeches
and
being
present
at
many
events
leaves
the
sensation
of
being
in
belgrade
or
at
sarajevo
europe
including
russia
and
including
also
the
polar
archipelagos
covers
an
area
of
a
little
more
than
ten
million
square
kilometres
canada
is
of
almost
the
same
size
the
united
states
of
america
has
about
the
same
territory
the
historical
procedure
before
the
war
was
towards
the
formation
of
large
territorial
unities
the
procedure
is
entirely
towards
a
process
of
dissolution
and
the
fractionizing
resulting
a
little
from
necessity
and
a
little
also
from
the
desire
to
dismember
the
old
empires
and
to
weaken
germany
has
assumed
proportions
almost
impossible
to
foresee
in
the
relations
between
the
various
states
good
and
evil
are
not
abstract
ideas
political
actions
can
only
be
judged
by
their
results
if
the
treaties
of
peace
which
have
been
imposed
on
the
conquered
would
be
capable
of
application
we
could
from
an
ethnical
point
of
view
regret
some
or
many
of
the
decisions
but
we
should
only
have
to
wait
for
the
results
of
time
for
a
definite
judgment
the
evil
is
that
the
treaties
which
have
been
signed
are
not
applicable
or
can
not
be
applied
without
the
rapid
dissolution
of
europe
so
the
of
the
peace
after
three
years
from
the
armistice
that
is
three
years
from
the
war
shows
on
the
whole
a
worsening
of
the
situation
the
spirit
of
violence
has
not
died
out
and
perhaps
in
some
countries
not
even
diminished
on
the
other
hand
the
causes
of
material
disagreement
have
increased
the
inequality
has
augmented
the
division
between
the
two
groups
has
grown
and
the
causes
of
hatred
have
been
consolidated
an
analysis
of
the
foreign
exchanges
indicated
a
process
of
undoing
and
not
a
tendency
to
reconstruction
we
have
referred
in
a
general
manner
to
the
conditions
of
germany
as
a
result
of
the
treaty
of
versailles
even
worse
is
the
situation
of
the
other
conquered
countries
in
so
far
that
either
they
have
not
been
treated
with
due
regard
or
they
have
lost
so
much
territory
that
they
have
no
possibility
of
reconstructing
their
national
existence
such
is
the
case
with
austria
with
turkey
and
with
hungary
bulgaria
which
has
a
tenacious
and
compact
population
composed
of
small
agriculturists
has
less
difficult
conditions
of
reconstruction
germany
has
fulfilled
loyally
all
the
conditions
of
the
disarmament
after
she
had
handed
over
her
fleet
she
destroyed
her
fortifications
she
destroyed
all
the
material
up
to
the
extreme
limit
imposed
by
the
treaties
she
disbanded
her
enormous
armies
if
in
any
one
of
the
works
of
destruction
she
had
proceeded
with
a
bad
will
if
she
had
tried
to
delay
them
it
would
be
perfectly
understandable
a
different
step
carries
one
to
a
dance
or
to
a
funeral
at
the
actual
moment
germany
has
no
fleet
no
army
no
artillery
and
is
in
a
condition
in
which
she
could
not
reply
to
any
act
of
violence
this
is
why
all
the
violence
of
the
poles
against
germany
has
found
hardly
any
opposition
all
this
is
so
evident
that
no
one
can
raise
doubts
on
the
question
everyone
remembers
said
hindenburg
the
difficult
task
that
the
united
states
had
to
put
in
the
field
an
army
of
a
million
men
nevertheless
they
had
the
protection
of
the
ocean
during
the
period
when
they
were
preparing
their
artillery
and
their
aerial
material
germany
for
her
aviation
for
her
heavy
artillery
for
her
armaments
is
not
even
separated
by
the
ocean
from
her
allies
and
on
the
contrary
they
are
firmly
established
in
german
territory
it
would
require
many
months
to
prepare
a
new
war
during
which
france
and
her
allies
would
not
be
resting
quietly
general
ludendorff
recently
made
certain
declarations
which
have
a
capital
importance
since
they
fit
the
facts
exactly
he
declared
that
a
war
of
reconquest
by
germany
against
the
allies
and
especially
against
france
is
for
an
indefinite
time
completely
impossible
from
the
technical
and
military
point
of
view
france
has
an
army
largely
supplied
with
all
the
means
of
battle
ready
to
march
at
any
time
which
could
smash
any
german
military
organization
hostile
to
france
the
more
so
since
by
the
destruction
of
the
german
war
industries
germany
has
lost
every
possibility
of
arming
herself
afresh
it
is
absurd
to
believe
that
a
german
army
ready
for
modern
warfare
can
be
organized
and
put
on
a
war
footing
secretly
a
german
army
which
could
fight
with
the
least
possible
hope
of
success
against
an
enemy
army
armed
and
equipped
in
the
most
modern
manner
would
first
of
all
have
to
be
based
on
a
huge
german
war
industry
which
naturally
could
not
be
improvised
or
built
up
in
secret
even
if
a
third
power
wished
to
arm
germany
it
would
not
be
possible
to
arm
her
so
quickly
and
mobilize
her
in
sufficient
time
to
prevent
the
enemy
army
from
obtaining
an
immediate
and
decisive
victory
it
would
be
necessary
as
everyone
realizes
even
in
france
that
germany
should
wish
to
commit
suicide
in
consequence
of
the
treaty
there
is
the
maximum
of
obstacles
which
mind
can
conceive
to
guard
against
any
german
peril
and
against
germany
there
have
been
accumulated
guarantees
that
never
before
has
history
recorded
the
tardieu
and
germany
can
not
do
anything
for
many
years
mobilization
requires
years
and
years
for
preparation
and
the
greatest
publicity
for
its
execution
wilson
spoke
of
guarantees
and
for
the
reduction
of
armaments
instead
after
the
treaties
had
been
concluded
if
the
conquered
were
completely
disarmed
the
conquering
nations
have
continued
to
arm
almost
all
the
conquering
nations
have
not
only
high
expenses
but
more
numerous
armies
if
the
conditions
of
peace
imposed
by
the
treaties
were
considered
supportable
remembering
the
fact
that
the
late
enemies
were
harmless
against
whom
are
these
continuous
increase
of
armaments
we
have
already
seen
the
military
conditions
imposed
on
germany
a
small
mercenary
army
no
obligatory
conscription
no
military
instruction
no
aviation
no
artillery
except
a
minimum
and
insignificant
quantity
required
by
the
necessities
of
interior
order
austria
bulgaria
and
hungary
can
only
have
insignificant
armies
austria
may
maintain
under
arms
men
but
her
ruined
finances
only
permit
her
according
to
the
latest
reports
to
keep
bulgaria
has
men
plus
gendarmes
hungary
according
to
the
treaty
of
trianon
has
turkey
in
europe
which
hardly
exists
any
more
as
a
territorial
state
except
for
the
city
of
constantinople
where
the
sovereignty
of
the
sultan
is
more
apparent
than
real
has
not
an
actual
army
taken
all
together
the
states
which
formed
the
powerful
nucleus
of
war
of
germany
as
they
are
now
reduced
territorially
have
under
arms
fewer
than
men
not
including
naturally
those
new
states
risen
on
the
ruins
of
the
old
central
empires
and
which
arm
themselves
by
the
request
and
sometimes
in
the
interest
of
some
state
of
the
entente
the
old
enemies
therefore
are
not
in
a
condition
to
make
war
and
are
placed
under
all
manner
of
controls
sometimes
the
controls
are
even
of
a
very
singular
nature
all
have
been
occupied
in
giving
the
sea
to
the
victors
poland
has
obtained
the
absurd
paradox
of
the
state
of
danzig
because
it
has
the
sea
the
constant
aim
of
the
allies
even
in
opposition
to
italy
has
been
to
give
free
and
safe
outlets
on
the
sea
coast
to
the
state
at
the
conference
of
london
and
san
remo
i
repeatedly
referred
to
the
expenses
of
these
military
missions
of
control
and
often
their
outrageous
imposition
on
the
conquered
who
are
suffering
from
hunger
there
are
generals
who
are
assigned
as
indemnity
and
expenses
of
all
sorts
salaries
which
are
much
superior
to
that
of
the
president
of
the
united
states
of
america
it
is
necessary
to
look
at
vienna
and
budapest
where
the
people
are
dying
of
hunger
to
see
the
carnival
of
the
danube
commission
for
the
rest
it
is
only
necessary
to
look
at
the
expense
accounts
of
the
reparations
commissions
to
be
convinced
that
this
sad
spectacle
of
greed
and
luxury
humiliates
the
victors
more
than
the
conquered
has
lost
every
access
to
the
sea
she
can
not
live
on
her
resources
with
her
enormous
capital
in
ruins
she
can
not
unite
with
germany
though
she
is
a
purely
german
country
because
the
treaty
requires
the
unanimous
consent
of
the
league
of
nations
and
france
having
refused
it
is
therefore
impossible
she
can
not
unite
with
with
hungary
and
other
countries
which
have
been
formed
from
the
austrian
empire
because
that
is
against
the
aspirations
of
the
german
populations
and
it
would
be
the
formation
anew
of
that
danube
state
which
with
its
numerous
contrasts
was
one
of
the
essential
causes
of
the
war
austria
has
lost
every
access
to
the
sea
has
consigned
her
fleet
and
her
merchant
marine
but
in
return
has
had
the
advantage
of
numerous
commissions
of
control
to
safeguard
the
military
naval
and
aeronautic
clauses
but
there
are
clauses
which
can
no
longer
be
justified
as
for
instance
when
austria
no
longer
has
a
sea
coast
art
of
the
treaty
of
germain
which
forbids
the
construction
or
acquisition
of
any
sort
of
submersible
vessel
even
commercial
it
is
impossible
to
understand
why
art
the
wireless
station
of
vienna
is
not
allowed
to
transmit
other
than
commercial
telegrams
under
the
surveillance
of
the
allied
and
associated
powers
who
take
the
trouble
to
determine
even
the
length
of
the
wave
to
be
used
before
the
war
in
france
desired
to
bring
her
army
to
the
maximum
of
efficiency
opposite
a
great
german
army
was
to
be
found
a
great
french
army
germany
had
in
according
to
the
budget
presented
to
the
reichstag
a
standing
army
of
soldiers
of
all
arms
of
which
were
officers
and
officers
it
was
the
greatest
army
of
europe
and
of
the
world
taking
into
account
its
real
efficiency
whilst
germany
has
no
longer
an
army
france
on
july
had
under
arms
men
of
which
were
officers
therefore
many
more
than
germany
had
before
the
war
given
its
demographic
character
it
is
the
greatest
military
force
which
has
been
seen
in
modern
times
and
can
only
have
two
reasons
either
military
domination
or
ruin
the
military
budget
proposed
for
the
present
year
in
the
ordinary
section
is
for
millions
of
francs
besides
that
portion
paid
by
germany
for
the
army
of
occupation
the
extraordinary
section
of
the
same
budget
is
for
millions
of
francs
besides
millions
for
expenses
repayable
for
the
maintenance
of
troops
of
occupation
in
foreign
countries
had
in
a
total
of
officers
and
men
the
states
which
have
arisen
from
her
ruins
have
a
good
many
more
whilst
has
as
a
matter
of
fact
only
men
and
hungary
has
only
has
men
of
which
are
officers
has
about
of
which
to
are
officers
but
the
two
allies
of
france
belgium
and
poland
belgium
no
longer
neutral
poland
always
in
disorder
and
in
a
state
of
continual
provocation
abroad
and
of
increasing
anarchy
at
home
have
in
their
turn
armies
which
previous
to
the
war
could
have
been
maintained
only
by
a
power
belgium
has
doubled
her
peace
effectives
which
now
amount
to
men
an
enormous
army
for
a
population
which
is
about
equal
to
that
of
the
city
of
new
york
or
london
poland
whose
economic
conditions
are
completely
disastrous
and
may
be
described
as
having
neither
money
nor
credit
any
more
but
which
maintains
more
employees
than
any
other
country
on
earth
has
under
arms
not
fewer
than
men
and
often
many
more
and
possibly
has
many
more
about
her
treaty
with
france
imposes
on
her
military
obligations
the
extension
of
which
can
not
be
compatible
with
the
policy
of
a
country
desiring
peace
poland
has
besides
vast
dreams
of
greatness
abroad
and
growing
ruin
in
the
interior
she
enslaves
herself
in
order
to
enslave
others
and
pretends
in
her
disorder
to
control
and
dominate
much
more
intelligent
and
cultured
peoples
rumania
has
under
arms
men
besides
carabineers
and
frontier
guards
greece
has
particularly
on
account
of
her
undertakings
in
asia
minor
which
only
the
lesser
intelligence
of
her
national
exaltations
can
explain
more
than
men
under
arms
she
is
suffocating
under
the
weight
of
heavy
armaments
and
can
move
only
with
difficulty
the
two
pupils
of
the
entente
greece
and
poland
exactly
like
naughty
children
have
a
policy
of
greed
and
capriciousness
poland
was
not
the
outcome
of
her
own
strength
but
of
the
strength
of
the
entente
greece
never
found
the
way
to
contribute
heavily
to
the
war
with
a
strong
army
and
after
the
war
has
the
most
numerous
army
which
she
has
ever
had
in
her
history
great
britain
and
italy
are
the
only
two
countries
which
have
largely
demobilized
great
britain
in
the
much
greater
measure
it
is
calculated
that
great
britain
has
under
arms
men
of
which
are
officers
in
this
number
however
are
not
included
men
in
india
and
the
personnel
of
the
air
force
in
italy
on
july
there
were
under
arms
soldiers
and
officers
in
all
of
which
however
were
carabineers
carrying
out
duties
almost
exclusively
of
public
order
under
the
pressure
and
as
a
result
of
the
example
of
the
states
which
have
come
through
the
war
those
states
which
did
not
take
part
have
also
largely
augmented
their
armies
so
whilst
the
conquered
have
ceased
every
preoccupation
the
neutrals
of
the
war
have
developed
their
armaments
and
the
conquerors
have
developed
theirs
beyond
measure
no
one
can
say
what
may
be
the
position
of
bolshevik
russia
probably
she
has
not
much
less
than
a
million
of
men
under
arms
also
because
in
a
communist
regime
the
vagabonds
and
the
violent
find
the
easiest
occupation
in
the
army
the
conquerors
having
disarmed
the
conquered
have
imposed
their
economic
conditions
their
absurd
moralities
and
territorial
humiliations
as
those
imposed
on
bulgaria
turkey
and
hungary
conditions
which
are
sufficiently
difficult
to
be
maintained
and
as
the
ferment
of
hate
develops
the
conquerors
do
not
disarm
above
all
the
little
states
do
not
disarm
who
have
wanted
too
much
have
obtained
too
much
and
now
do
not
know
how
to
maintain
what
they
have
in
many
countries
for
certain
social
reasons
war
has
become
an
industry
they
live
by
the
state
of
war
what
would
they
do
without
a
state
of
war
in
general
then
europe
has
considerably
more
men
under
arms
than
in
not
only
has
it
not
disarmed
as
the
entente
always
declared
would
be
the
consequence
of
the
victory
of
the
principles
of
democracy
but
the
victors
are
always
leaning
toward
further
armament
the
more
difficult
it
becomes
to
maintain
the
conditions
of
the
peace
because
of
their
severity
and
their
absurdity
the
more
necessary
it
is
to
maintain
armies
the
conquered
have
not
armies
the
conquerors
are
or
perhaps
up
to
a
short
time
ago
were
sure
that
the
big
armies
would
serve
to
enforce
the
payment
of
the
indemnities
now
in
fact
they
would
not
serve
for
anything
else
at
the
conference
of
london
after
a
long
discussion
in
february
the
economic
manifesto
was
drawn
up
which
warned
europe
of
the
perils
of
the
economic
situation
lloyd
george
and
myself
were
easily
agreed
in
denouncing
it
as
the
gravest
danger
as
the
principal
cause
of
high
prices
and
of
economic
disorder
both
as
to
the
maintenance
of
large
armies
and
in
the
continuation
of
the
state
of
war
a
europe
divided
distinctly
into
two
parts
can
not
be
pacific
even
after
the
conquered
have
yielded
up
their
arms
the
conquerors
are
bound
to
arm
themselves
because
of
their
own
inquietude
from
the
conviction
that
the
only
salvation
is
in
force
which
allows
if
not
a
true
peace
at
least
an
armed
peace
if
not
the
development
of
production
and
exchange
at
least
the
possibility
of
cutting
off
from
the
markets
the
very
fountains
of
riches
violence
begets
new
violence
if
the
conditions
of
the
peace
can
not
be
fulfilled
other
heavier
conditions
can
be
imposed
in
france
irresponsible
people
are
supporting
already
the
necessity
of
occupying
permanently
the
ruhr
that
is
to
say
the
greatest
german
centre
for
the
production
of
coal
and
of
not
respecting
the
plebiscite
of
upper
silesia
what
has
been
said
about
the
armies
is
true
also
about
the
fleets
there
is
a
race
towards
the
increase
of
naval
armaments
if
first
that
was
the
preoccupation
of
the
conquered
now
it
is
the
preoccupation
of
the
conquerors
in
the
exchange
of
doubts
into
which
they
have
fallen
after
the
war
the
state
of
mind
which
has
been
created
between
great
britain
the
united
states
of
america
and
japan
deserves
to
be
seriously
examined
the
race
for
naval
armaments
into
which
these
three
countries
entered
not
many
months
ago
and
the
competition
between
the
two
great
people
can
not
be
other
than
very
damaging
for
civilization
the
great
war
which
has
been
fought
was
at
bottom
the
fight
between
the
germanic
race
and
the
slav
race
it
was
the
doubts
in
regard
to
the
last
and
not
in
regard
to
france
which
pushed
germany
to
war
and
precipitated
events
the
results
of
the
continental
war
however
are
the
suppression
of
germany
which
lost
as
well
as
of
russia
which
had
not
resisted
and
france
alone
has
gathered
the
fruits
of
the
situation
if
they
can
be
called
that
from
amongst
the
thorns
which
everywhere
surround
the
victory
but
the
war
was
decided
above
all
by
the
intervention
of
the
people
great
britain
her
dominions
and
the
united
states
of
america
nothing
but
the
small
political
intelligence
of
the
german
statesmen
could
have
united
in
the
same
group
the
peoples
who
have
the
greatest
contrast
of
interests
among
themselves
great
britain
russia
the
united
states
of
america
japan
france
and
italy
but
now
the
situation
of
europe
and
especially
that
of
asia
is
creating
fresh
competitions
the
expenses
for
the
navies
according
to
the
figures
of
the
various
budgets
from
to
have
risen
in
the
united
states
of
america
from
millions
of
lire
to
in
great
britain
from
millions
to
in
japan
from
millions
to
in
france
from
millions
to
in
italy
from
millions
to
the
sums
proposed
for
new
constructions
in
the
year
are
millions
in
the
united
states
of
america
millions
for
great
britain
millions
for
japan
millions
for
france
and
millions
for
italy
the
united
states
of
america
and
great
britain
are
countries
of
great
resources
they
can
stand
the
effort
but
can
japan
which
has
but
limited
resources
support
these
for
any
length
of
time
or
has
she
some
immediate
intentions
a
comparative
table
of
the
navies
in
and
shows
that
the
fleets
of
the
conquering
countries
are
very
much
more
powerful
than
they
were
before
the
war
nevertheless
russia
and
and
the
people
arisen
in
their
territories
are
not
naval
powers
germany
has
lost
all
her
fleet
the
race
for
naval
armaments
regards
especially
the
two
powers
and
japan
the
race
for
land
armaments
regards
all
the
conquerors
of
europe
and
especially
the
small
states
this
situation
can
not
but
be
the
cause
of
great
preoccupation
but
the
greater
preoccupation
arises
from
the
fact
that
the
minor
states
especially
those
which
took
no
part
in
the
war
become
every
day
more
exigent
and
display
fresh
aspirations
the
whole
system
of
the
treaty
of
versailles
has
been
erected
on
the
error
of
poland
poland
was
not
created
as
the
noble
manifestation
of
the
rights
of
nationality
ethnical
poland
was
not
created
but
a
great
state
which
as
she
is
can
not
live
long
because
there
are
not
great
foreign
minorities
but
a
whole
mass
of
populations
which
can
not
poland
which
has
already
the
experience
of
a
too
numerous
israelitic
population
has
not
the
capacity
to
assimilate
the
germans
the
russians
and
the
ukranians
which
the
treaty
of
versailles
has
unjustly
given
to
her
against
the
very
declarations
of
wilson
so
that
after
with
the
aid
of
the
entente
having
had
the
strength
to
resist
the
bolshevik
troops
poland
is
now
in
a
state
of
permanent
anarchy
consumes
and
does
not
produce
pays
debts
with
a
fantastic
bigness
and
does
not
know
how
to
regulate
the
incomings
no
country
in
the
world
has
ever
more
abused
paper
currency
her
paper
money
is
probably
the
most
greatly
depreciated
of
any
country
on
earth
she
has
not
succeeded
in
organizing
her
own
production
and
now

the
whole

the

conceived
as

a

principal
duty
is
that
of
disorganizing

the
result
of
a
miracle
of
the
war
no
one
could
foretell
the
simultaneous
fall
of
the
central
empires
and
of
the
russian
empire
was
formed
not
from
a
tenacious
endeavour
but
from
an
unforeseen
circumstance
which
was
the
just
reward
for
the
long
martyrdom
of
a
people
the
borders
of
poland
will
reach
in
time
to
the
baltic
sea
in
the
north
the
carpathians

and
pomerania
the
new
patriots
dream
of
an
immense
poland
the
old
poland
of
tradition
and
then
to
descend
into
the
countries
of
the
ukraine
and
dominate
new
territories
it
is
easy
to
see
that
sooner
or
later
the
bolshevik
degeneration
over
russia
will
be
recomposed
germany
in
spite
of
all
the
attempts
to
break
her
up
and
crush
her
unity
within
thirty
or
forty
years
will
be
the
most
formidable
ethnical
nucleus
of
continental
europe
what
will
then
happen
to
a
poland
which
pretends
to
divide
two
people
who
represent
numerically
and
will
represent
in
other
fields
also
the
greatest
forces
of
continental
europe
of
amongst
many
in
france
there
is
the
old
conception
of
napoleon
i
who
considered
the
whole
of
european
politics
from
an
erroneous
point
of
view
that
of
a
lasting
french
hegemony
in
europe
when
the
lasting
hegemony
of
peoples
is
no
longer
possible
in
the
sad
solitude
of
his
exile
at
saint
helena
napoleon
i
said
that
not
to
have
created
a
powerful
poland
keystone
of
the
roof
of
the
european
edifice
not
to
have
destroyed
prussia
and
to
have
been
mistaken
in
regard
to
russia
were
the
three
great
errors
of
his
life
but
all
his
work
had
as
an
end
to
put
the
life
of
europe
under
the
control
of
france
and
was
necessarily
wrecked
by
reality
which
does
not
permit
the
lasting
mistake
of
a
single
nation
which
places
herself
above
all
the
others
in
a
free
and
progressive
europe
if
the
policy
of
the
entente
towards
germany
and
towards
the
conquered
countries
does
not
correspond
either
to
collective
declarations
made
during
the
war
or
to
the
promises
solemnly
made
by
wilson
the
policy
towards
russia
has
been
a
whole
series
of
error
in
fact
one
can
not
talk
of
a
policy
of
the
entente
in
so
far
that
with
the
exception
of
a
few
errors
committed
in
common
great
britain
france
and
italy
have
each
followed
their
own
policy
in
his
sixth
point
among
the
fourteen
points
no
longer
pure
but
violated
and
outraged
worse
than
the
women
of
a
conquered
race
by
a
tribe
of
kurds
wilson
said
on
january
that
the
treatment
meted
out
to
russia
by
the
sister
nations
and
therefore
their
loyalty
in
assisting
her
to
settle
herself
should
be
the
stern
proof
of
their
goodwill
they
should
show
that
they
did
not
confound
their
own
interests
or
rather
their
egoism
with
what
should
be
done
for
russia
the
proof
was
most
unfortunate
the
attitude
of
the
entente
towards
russia
has
had
different
phases
in
the
first
phase
the
prevailing
idea
especially
on
the
part
of
one
of
the
allies
was
to
send
military
expeditions
in
conjunction
especially
with
rumania
and
poland
this
idea
was
immediately
abandoned
on
account
of
its
very
absurdity
in
the
second
phase
the
greatest
hopes
were
placed
in
the
blockade
of
isolating
russia
completely
cutting
off
from
her
and
for
the
rest
she
no
longer
had
it
every
facility
of
trade
exchange
at
the
same
time
war
on
the
part
of
poland
and
rumania
was
encouraged
to
help
the
attempt
which
the
men
of
the
old
regime
were
making
in
the
interior
france
alone
reached
the
point
of
officially
recognizing
the
tsarist
undertaking
of
general
wrangel
lloyd
george
with
the
exception
of
some
initial
doubts
always
had
the
clearest
ideas
in
regard
to
russia
and
i
never
found
myself
in
disagreement
with
him
in
valuing
the
men
and
the
russian
situation
it
is
easy
for
a
broad
and
serene
mind
to
judge
the
position
of
the
rest
for
my
part
i
always
tried
to
follow
that
policy
which
would
best
bring
about
the
most
useful
result
with
the
least
damage
after
the
war
the
working
masses
in
europe
had
the
greatest
illusions
about
russian
communism
and
the
bolshevik
organization
every
military
expedition
against
russia
signified
giving
the
people
the
conviction
that
it
was
desired
not
to
fight
an
enemy
but
to
suffocate
in
blood
an
attempt
at
a
communist
organization
i
have
always
thought
that
the
dictatorship
of
the
proletariat
that
is
the
dictatorship
of
ignorance
and
incapacity
would
necessarily
lead
to
disaster
and
that
hunger
and
death
would
follow
violence
there
are
for
the
peoples
great
errors
which
must
be
carried
out
in
the
very
effort
to
benefit
civilization
our
propaganda
would
have
served
nothing
without
the
reality
of
ruin
only
the
death
by
hunger
of
millions
of
men
in
communist
russia
will
convince
the
working
masses
in
europe
and
america
that
the
experiment
of
russia
is
not
to
be
followed
rather
is
it
to
be
avoided
at
any
cost
to
exterminate
the
communist
attempt
by
an
unjust
war
even
if
it
were
possible
would
have
meant
ruin
for
western
civilization
on
repeated
occasions
i
have
counselled
rumania
and
poland
not
to
make
any
attempt
against
russia
and
to
limit
themselves
to
defence
every
unjust
aggression
on
the
part
of
bolshevik
russia
would
have
found
the
entente
disposed
to
further
sacrifice
to
save
two
free
nations
but
any
provocation
on
their
part
could
not
create
secure
solidarity
when
i
assumed
the
direction
of
the
government
in
june
an
italian
military
expedition
was
under
orders
for
georgia
the
english
troops
who
were
in
small
numbers
were
withdrawing
italy
had
with
the
consent
of
the
allies
and
partly
by
her
own
desire
prepared
a
big
military
expedition
a
considerable
number
of
divisions
were
ready
as
also
were
the
ships
to
commence
the
transport
georgia
is
a
country
of
extraordinary
natural
resources
and
it
was
thought
that
she
would
be
able
to
furnish
italy
with
a
great
number
of
raw
materials
which
she
lacked
what
surprised
me
was
that
not
only
men
of
the
government
but
intelligent
financiers
and
men
of
very
advanced
ideas
were
convinced
supporters
of
this
expedition
however
confronted
by
much
opposition
i
immediately
renounced
this
undertaking
and
renounced
it
in
a
definite
form
limiting
myself
to
encouraging
every
commercial
enterprise
certainly
the
allies
could
not
suggest
anything
unfriendly
to
italy
but
the
effect
of
the
expedition
was
to
put
italy
directly
at
variance
with
the
government
of
moscow
to
launch
her
upon
an
adventure
of
which
it
was
impossible
to
tell
the
consequences
in
fact
not
long
afterwards
georgia
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
bolsheviks
who
sent
there
an
army
of
men
and
since
then
she
has
not
been
able
to
liberate
herself
if
italy
had
made
that
expedition
she
would
have
been
engaged
in
a
frightful
military
adventure
with
most
difficult
and
costly
transport
in
a
theatre
of
war
of
insuperable
difficulty
to
what
end
georgia
before
the
war
formed
part
of
the
russian
empire
and
no
country
of
the
entente
had
considered
that
unjust
further
as
though
the
vast
empire
and
the
dominion
of
the
caucasus
were
not
enough
for
russia
the
entente
with
monstrous
condescension
had
given
to
russia
constantinople
and
the
straits
and
a
huge
zone
in
asia
minor
how
could
you
take
away
from
russia
a
territory
which
was
legitimately
hers
and
if
georgia
and
the
other
states
of
the
caucasus
had
sufficient
strength
to
live
autonomously
how
can
you
dominate
aryan
people
who
have
risen
to
a
notable
state
of
development
to
go
to
georgia
inevitably
meant
war
with
russia
for
italy
and
one
moreover
fraught
with
extraordinary
difficulties
in
fact
later
the
government
of
moscow
as
we
have
said
succeeded
in
invading
as
well
as
georgia
almost
all
the
republics
of
the
caucasus
and
at
san
remo
discussing
the
possibility
of
an
expedition
on
the
part
of
great
britain
france
and
italy
to
defend
at
least
the
oil
production
after
the
report
of
a
military
committee
presided
over
by
marshal
foch
the
conclusion
was
quickly
and
easily
arrived
at
that
it
was
better
to
leave
the
matter
alone
italy
had
already
made
an
expedition
into
albania
the
reason
for
which
beyond
the
military
necessities
for
the
period
of
the
war
has
never
been
understood
except
that
of
spending
a
huge
sum
without
receiving
the
gratitude
of
the
albanians
an
expedition
in
georgia
would
have
done
harm
the
consequence
of
which
can
not
be
readily
measured
it
could
indeed
have
meant
ruin
even
those
minds
that
are
most
blinded
by
prejudice
and
hate
recognize
the
complete
failure
of
the
russian
communist
system
the
dictatorship
of
the
proletariat
is
reduced
in
practice
to
a
military
dictatorship
of
a
communist
group
which
represents
only
a
fraction
of
the
working
classes
and
that
not
the
best
the
bolshevik
government
is
in
the
hands
of
a
small
minority
in
which
fanaticism
has
taken
the
place
of
character
everything
which
represented
the
work
of
the
past
has
been
destroyed
and
they
have
not
known
how
to
construct
anything
the
great
industries
have
fallen
and
production
is
paralysed
russia
has
lived
for
a
long
time
on
the
residues
of
her
capitalistic
production
rather
than
on
new
productions
the
productivity
of
her
agricultural
and
industrial
work
has
been
killed
by
communism
and
the
force
of
work
has
been
reduced
to
a
minimum
the
russian
people
are
in
straits
which
have
no
comparison
and
entire
territories
are
dying
of
hunger
the
communist
regime
in
a
short
time
has
precipitated
such
damage
and
such
misery
as
no
system
of
oppression
could
achieve
in
centuries
it
is
the
proof
if
any
were
necessary
that
the
form
of
communist
production
is
not
only
harmful
but
not
even
lasting
the
economists
say
that
it
is
absurd
but
given
the
collective
madness
which
has
attacked
some
people
nothing
is
absurd
beyond
hoping
in
the
rapid
recovery
of
the
most
excited
nations
if
any
country
could
be
the
scene
of
a
communist
experiment
it
was
russia
imperial
russia
represented
the
most
vast
continuative
territory
which
a
state
ever
occupied
in
all
history
records
of
vast
empires
under
the
tsars
a
territory
which
was
almost
three
times
the
size
of
the
united
states
of
america
was
occupied
by
a
people
who
with
the
exception
of
a
few
cases
of
individual
revolt
were
accustomed
to
the
most
servile
obedience
under
nicholas
ii
a
few
men
exercised
rule
in
a
most
despotic
form
over
more
than
individuals
spread
over
an
immense
territory
all
obeyed
blindly
centralization
was
so
great
and
the
obedience
to
the
central
power
so
absolute
that
no
hostile
demonstration
was
tolerated
for
long
the
communist
regime
therefore
was
able
to
count
not
only
on
the
apathy
of
the
russian
people
but
also
upon
the
blindest
obedience
to
this
fundamental
condition
of
success
to
a
government
which
must
regulate
production
despotically
was
joined
another
even
greater
condition
of
success
russia
is
one
of
those
countries
which
like
the
united
states
of
america
china
and
brazil
the
four
greatest
countries
of
the
earth
not
counting
the
english
dominions
with
much
thinner
populations
possess
within
their
own
territories
everything
necessary
for
life
imagine
a
country
of
economy
that
lives
entirely
upon
her
own
resources
and
trades
with
no
one
and
that
is
what
happened
in
russia
as
a
result
of
the
blockade
russia
has
the
possibility
of
realizing
within
herself
the
most
prosperous
conditions
of
existence
she
has
in
her
territories
everything
grain
textile
fibres
combustibles
of
every
sort
russia
is
one
of
the
greatest
reserves
if
not
the
greatest
reserve
in
the
world
well
the
communist
organization
was
sufficient
the
bureaucratic
centralization
which
communism
must
necessarily
carry
with
it
to
arrest
every
form
of
production
russia
which
before
could
give
grain
to
all
is
dying
of
hunger
russia
which
had
sufficient
quantities
of
coal
for
herself
and
could
give
petroleum
to
all
europe
can
no
longer
move
her
railways
russia
which
had
wool
flax
linen
and
could
have
easily
increased
her
cotton
cultivation
in
the
caucasus
can
not
even
clothe
the
soldiers
and
functionaries
of
the
bolshevik
state
ceased
is
the
stimulus
of
individual
interest
few
work
the
peasants
work
only
to
produce
what
their
families
need
the
workers
in
the
city
are
chiefly
engaged
in
meetings
and
political
reunions
all
wish
to
live
upon
the
state
and
production
organized
autocratically
and
bureaucratically
every
day
dries
up
and
withers
a
bit
more
to
those
who
read
the
collection
of
laws
issued
by
the
bolshevik
government
many
institutions
appear
not
only
reasonable
but
also
full
of
interest
and
justice
also
many
laws
of
the
absolute
governments
of
past
regimes
appear
intelligent
and
noble
but
the
law
has
not
in
itself
any
power
of
creation
it
regulates
relations
does
not
create
them
it
can
even
take
away
wealth
from
some
and
give
it
to
others
but
can
not
create
the
wealth
when
the
individual
interest
begins
to
lack
work
which
is
sorrow
and
pain
lags
and
does
not
produce
to
begin
with
it
weakens
in
the
short
days
when
energy
is
avoided
and
then
it
stops
through
incapacity
for
energy
the
old
fundamental
truth
is
that
in
all
the
aryan
tongues
the
words
which
indicate
work
have
the
same
root
as
the
words
which
denote
pain
among
the
great
mass
of
man
work
is
only
done
by
necessity
or
under
the
stimulus
of
individual
interest
which
excites
the
production
of
wealth
they
work
for
wealth
and
therefore
in
the
aryan
tongues
wealth
means
dominion
and
power
two
years
ago
i
wanted
in
spite
of
the
opinion
of
others
to
consent
to
the
italian
socialists
visiting
russia
i
was
convinced
that
nothing
would
have
served
better
to
break
in
italy
the
sympathy
for
russia
or
rather
the
illusions
of
the
revolutionaries
as
the
spectacle
of
famine
and
disorder
would
never
did
the
press
of
my
country
or
the
greater
part
of
it
criticize
with
more
violence
a
proposal
which
i
considered
to
be
both
wise
and
prudent
i
am
glad
to
state
that
i
was
right
and
that
maybe
through
the
uncertainties
and
the
lessons
of
those
who
had
spread
the
illusions
the
italian
socialists
returned
from
russia
were
bound
to
recognize
that
the
communist
experiment
was
the
complete
ruin
of
the
russian
people
no
conservative
propaganda
could
have
been
more
efficacious
than
the
vision
of
the
truth
i
am
convinced
that
the
hostile
attitude
and
almost
persecution
on
the
part
of
the
entente
rather
helped
the
bolshevik
government
whose
claims
to
discredit
were
already
so
numerous
that
it
was
not
necessary
to
nullify
it
by
an
unjust
and
evident
persecution
the
bolshevik
government
could
not
be
recognized
it
gave
no
guarantees
of
loyalty
and
too
often
its
representatives
had
violated
the
rights
of
hospitality
and
intrigued
through
fanatics
and
excited
people
to
extend
the
revolution
revolution
and
government
are
two
terms
which
can
not
but
not
to
recognize
the
government
of
the
soviet
does
not
mean
that
the
conditions
of
such
recognition
must
include
that
the
war
debt
shall
be
guaranteed
and
worse
still
the
debt
or
that
the
gold
resources
and
the
metals
of
russia
shall
be
given
as
a
guarantee
of
that
debt
this
morality
exclusively
financial
and
plutocratic
can
not
be
the
base
of
international
relations
in
a
period
in
which
humanity
after
the
sorrows
of
the
war
has
the
annoyance
of
a
peace
which
no
one
foresaw
and
of
which
very
few
in
the
early
days
understood
the
dangers
even
when
there
was
a
tendency
favourable
to
the
recognition
of
the
republic
of
the
soviet
i
was
always
decidedly
against
it
it
is
impossible
to
recognize
a
state
which
bases
all
its
relations
on
violence
and
which
in
its
relations
with
foreign
states
seeks
or
has
almost
always
sought
to
carry
out
revolutionary
propaganda
even
when
yielding
to
an
impulse
which
it
was
not
possible
to
avoid
in
the
new
italian
chamber
after
the
elections
of
not
only
the
socialists
but
above
all
the
catholic
popular
party
and
the
party
of
rinnovamento
of
which
the
especially
formed
part
voted
unanimously
an
order
of
the
day
for
the
recognition
of
the
actual
government
of
russia
i
did
not
think
it
right
to
give
and
did
not
give
effect
to
that
vote
impulsively
generous
which
would
have
invested
italy
with
the
responsibility
of
recognizing
even
if
it
were
the
government
of
the
soviet
i
have
always
however
rebelled
and
would
never
give
my
consent
to
any
military
undertakings
against
russia
not
even
to
a
participation
in
the
undertakings
of
men
of
the
old
regime
it
was
easy
to
foresee
that
the
population
would
not
have
followed
them
and
that
the
undertakings
were
doomed
to
failure
however
all
the
attempts
at
military
revolts
and
were
encouraged
with
supplies
of
arms
and
material
but
in
all
the
military
undertakings
in
spite
of
the
help
given
failed
one
after
another
in
february
the
attempt
of
admiral
koltchak
failed
miserably
and
in
march
that
of
general
judenic
failed
has
the
attempt
of
denikin
all
the
hopes
of
the
restoration
were
centred
in
general
wrangel
the
only
grand
duke
with
any
claim
to
military
authority
also
sent
to
tell
me
that
this
was
a
serious
attempt
with
probability
of
success
general
wrangel
in
fact
reunited
the
scattered
forces
of
the
old
regime
and
occupied
a
large
territory
in
power
france
not
only
recognized
in
the
government
of
wrangel
the
legitimate
representative
of
russia
but
nominated
her
official
representatives
with
him
in
november
even
the
army
of
wrangel
which
appeared
to
be
of
granite
was
scattered
poland
through
alternating
vicissitudes
claimed
the
power
of
resistance
but
has
shown
that
she
has
no
offensive
power
against
russia
so
all
the
attempts
at
restoration
have
broken
one
after
another
one
of
the
greatest
errors
of
the
entente
has
been
to
treat
russia
on
many
occasions
not
as
a
fallen
friend
but
as
a
conquered
enemy
nothing
has
been
more
deplorable
than
to
have
considered
as
russia
the
men
of
the
old
regime
who
have
been
treated
for
a
long
time
as
the
representatives
of
an
existing
state
when
the
state
no
longer
existed
let
us
suppose
that
the
bolshevik
government
transforms
itself
and
gives
guarantees
to
the
civilized
nations
not
to
make
revolutionary
agitations
in
foreign
countries
to
maintain
the
pledges
she
assumes
and
to
respect
the
liberty
of
citizens
the
united
states
of
america
great
britain
and
italy
would
recognize
her
at
once
but
france
has
an
entirely
different
point
of
view
she
will
not
give
any
recognition
unless
the
creditors
of
the
old
regime
are
guaranteed
in
june
the
government
of
moscow
sent
some
gold
to
sweden
to
purchase
indispensable
goods
millerand
president
of
the
council
of
ministers
and
minister
of
foreign
affairs
declared
to
the
minister
of
sweden
at
paris
that
if
his
government
consented
to
receive
russian
gold
acte
de
he
then
telegraphed
to
the
minister
of
finance
at
stockholm
regretting
that
the
government
and
public
opinion
in
sweden
were
tending
to
consider
the
of
the
french
creditors
of
the
ancient
russian
regime
to
be
such
that
they
did
not
stop
the
consignment
of
swedish
goods
against
russian
gold
he
added
at
the
end
that
the
syndicates
of
creditors
could
utilize
the
news
in
telegram
no
in
which
the
swedish
government
gave
notice
of
the
trade
and
put
a
sequestration
on
russian
gold
sent
to
sweden
this
telegram
better
than
any
speech
shows
the
diversity
of
conception
the
bolshevik
government
may
be
so
immoral
that
we
can
not
recognize
it
until
it
gives
serious
guarantees
but
if
the
government
of
moscow
sends
a
little
of
the
gold
that
remains
or
has
remained
to
buy
goods
what
right
have
we
to
sequestrate
the
gold
in
the
interests
of
the
creditors
of
the
old
regime
the
new
regime
born
after
the
revolution
can
also
not
recognize
the
debts
of
the
old
regime
and
annul
them
it
is
not
for
that
that
we
have
no
relations
with
it
we
have
pushed
germany
by
absurd
demands
to
ruin
her
circulation
it
is
already
at
about
milliard
of
marks
if
it
goes
to
or
to
it
will
be
necessary
to
annul
it
nearly
the
same
as
is
done
for
bills
of
exchange
and
for
this
should
we
not
treat
with
germany
the
new
plutocratic
conception
which
marks
the
policy
of
a
section
of
the
entente
is
not
lasting
and
the
people
have
a
justifiable
diffidence
towards
it
bolshevism
as
i
have
repeatedly
stated
can
not
be
judged
by
our
western
eyes
it
is
not
a
popular
and
revolutionary
movement
it
is
a
religious
fanaticism
of
the
orthodox
of
the
east
hoisted
on
the
throne
of
tsarist
despotism
italy
is
the
country
which
suffers
most
from
the
lack
of
continuous
relations
with
russia
in
so
far
that
almost
all
italian
commerce
and
in
consequence
the
prices
of
freight
and
goods
have
been
for
almost
half
a
century
regulated
by
the
traffic
with
the
black
sea
ships
which
leave
england
fully
laden
with
goods
for
italy
generally
continue
to
the
black
sea
where
they
fill
up
with
grain
petroleum
and
then
return
to
england
after
having
taken
fresh
cargoes
in
italy
and
especially
iron
in
spain
it
was
possible
in
italy
for
long
periods
of
time
to
obtain
most
favourable
freights
and
have
coal
at
almost
the
same
price
as
in
england
the
voyages
of
the
ships
were
made
both
coming
and
going
fully
laden
the
situation
of
russia
therefore
hurts
especially
italy
great
britain
has
mediterranean
interests
france
is
partly
a
mediterranean
nation
italy
alone
is
a
mediterranean
nation
although
italy
has
a
particular
interest
in
reopening
relations
with
russia
the
italian
government
has
understood
that
the
best
and
shortest
way
is
not
to
recognize
the
government
of
moscow
but
italy
will
never
subordinate
her
recognition
to
plutocratic
considerations
whatever
government
there
may
be
in
italy
it
will
never
associate
itself
with
actions
directed
to
compelling
russia
in
order
to
be
recognized
to
guarantee
the
payment
of
obligations
assumed
previous
to
the
war
and
the
revolution
civilization
has
already
suppressed
corporal
punishment
for
insolvent
debtors
and
slavery
from
which
individuals
are
released
should
not
be
imposed
on
nations
by
democracies
which
say
they
are
civilized
the
fall
of
the
communistic
organization
in
russia
is
inevitable
very
probably
from
the
immense
revolutionary
catastrophe
which
has
hit
russia
there
will
spring
up
the
diffusion
of
a
regime
of
small
landed
proprietors
whatever
is
contrary
to
human
nature
is
not
lasting
and
communism
can
only
accumulate
misery
and
on
its
ruins
will
arise
new
forms
of
life
which
we
can
not
yet
define
but
bolshevik
russia
can
count
still
on
two
elements
which
we
do
not
habitually
take
into
account
the
apathy
and
indolence
of
the
people
on
the
one
hand
and
the
strength
of
the
military
organization
on
the
other
no
other
people
would
have
resigned
itself
to
the
intense
misery
and
to
the
infinite
sufferings
which
tens
of
millions
of
russians
endure
without
complaint
but
still
in
the
midst
of
so
much
misery
no
other
people
would
have
known
how
to
maintain
a
powerful
and
disciplined
army
such
as
is
the
army
of
revolutionary
russia
the
russian
people
have
never
had
any
sympathy
for
the
military
undertakings
which
the
entente
has
aided
during
some
of
the
meetings
of
premiers
at
paris
and
london
i
had
occasion
in
the
sittings
of
the
conferences
to
speak
with
the
representatives
of
the
new
states
especially
those
from
the
caucasus
they
were
all
agreed
in
considering
that
the
action
of
the
men
of
the
old
regime
and
especially
denikin
was
directed
at
the
suppression
of
the
independent
states
and
to
the
return
of
the
old
forms
and
they
attributed
to
this
the
aversion
of
the
russian
people
to
them
certainly
it
is
difficult
to
speak
of
russia
where
there
exists
no
longer
a
free
press
and
the
people
have
hardly
any
other
preoccupation
than
that
of
not
dying
of
hunger
although
it
is
a
disastrous
organization
the
organization
of
the
soviet
remains
still
the
only
one
which
it
is
not
possible
to
substitute
immediately
with
another
although
the
russian
people
can
slowly
into
international
life
and
take
up
again
its
thread
a
long
time
is
necessary
but
also
it
is
necessary
to
change
tactics
the
peasants
who
form
the
enormous
mass
of
the
russian
people
look
with
terror
on
the
old
regime
they
have
occupied
the
land
and
will
maintain
that
occupation
they
do
not
want
the
return
of
the
great
russian
princes
who
possessed
lands
covering
provinces
and
were
even
ignorant
of
their
possessions
one
of
the
causes
which
has
permitted
bolshevism
to
last
is
as
i
have
said
the
attitude
of
the
entente
which
on
many
occasions
has
shown
the
greatest
sympathy
for
the
men
of
the
old
regime
the
tsar
of
russia
was
an
insignificant
man
all
the
grand
dukes
were
persons
without
dignity
and
without
credit
and
the
court
and
government
abounded
with
men
without
scruples
violent
thieves
and
drunkards
if
bolshevik
government
had
been
ruin
no
one
can
deny
but
that
a
great
part
of
the
blame
belongs
to
the
old
regime
the
return
of
which
no
honest
man
desires
an
error
not
less
serious
was
to
allow
poland
to
occupy
large
tracts
of
purely
russian
territory
there
remain
in
europe
therefore
so
many
states
of
unrest
which
do
not
only
concern
the
conditions
of
the
conquered
countries
but
also
those
of
the
conquering
countries
we
have
already
seen
how
germany
and
the
states
which
form
part
of
her
group
can
not
now
any
longer
represent
a
danger
of
war
for
many
years
to
come
and
that
none
the
less
the
victorious
countries
and
the
new
states
continue
to
arm
themselves
in
a
most
formidable
manner
we
have
seen
what
an
element
of
disorder
poland
has
become
and
how
the
policy
of
the
entente
towards
russia
has
constituted
a
permanent
danger
but
all
europe
is
still
uncertain
and
the
ground
is
so
movable
that
any
new
construction
threatens
ruin
austria
hungary
bulgaria
turkey
can
not
live
under
the
conditions
imposed
on
them
by
the
treaties
but
the
new
states
for
the
most
part
are
themselves
in
a
sufficiently
serious
position
with
the
exception
of
finland
all
the
other
states
which
have
arisen
on
the
ruins
of
the
russian
empire
are
in
serious
difficulty
if
esthonia
and
lithuania
are
in
a
fairly
tolerable
situation
lettonia
is
in
real
ruin
and
hunger
and
tuberculosis
rule
almost
everywhere
as
in
many
districts
of
poland
and
russia
at
riga
hunger
and
sickness
have
caused
enormous
losses
amongst
the
population
recently
children
were
in
an
extremely
serious
physical
and
mental
condition
in
a
single
dispensary
of
children
who
were
brought
for
treatment
were
were
scrofulous
anaemic
and
suffering
from
rickets
the
data
published
in
england
and
the
united
states
and
those
of
the
red
cross
of
geneva
are
terrible
even
with
the
greatest
imagination
it
is
difficult
to
think
how
hungary
and
austria
can
live
and
carry
out
even
in
the
smallest
degree
the
obligations
imposed
by
the
treaties
by
a
moral
paradox
besides
living
they
must
indemnify
the
victors
according
to
the
treaties
of
germain
and
the
trianon
for
all
the
damages
which
the
war
has
brought
on
themselves
and
which
the
victors
have
suffered
hungary
has
undergone
the
greatest
occupation
of
her
territories
and
her
wealth
this
poor
great
country
which
saved
both
civilization
and
christianity
has
been
treated
with
a
bitterness
which
nothing
can
explain
except
the
desire
of
greed
of
those
surrounding
her
and
the
fact
that
the
weaker
people
seeing
the
stronger
overcome
wish
and
insist
that
she
shall
be
reduced
to
impotence
nothing
in
fact
can
justify
the
measures
of
violence
and
the
depredations
committed
in
magyar
territory
what
was
the
rumanian
occupation
of
hungary
a
systematic
rapine
and
the
systematic
destruction
for
a
long
time
hidden
and
the
stern
reproach
which
lloyd
george
addressed
in
london
to
the
premier
of
rumania
was
perfectly
justified
after
the
war
everyone
wanted
some
sacrifice
from
hungary
and
no
one
dared
to
say
a
word
of
peace
or
goodwill
for
her
when
i
tried
it
was
too
late
the
victors
hated
hungary
for
her
proud
defence
the
adherents
of
socialism
do
not
love
her
because
she
had
to
resist
under
more
than
difficult
conditions
internal
and
external
bolshevism
the
international
financiers
hate
her
because
of
the
violences
committed
against
the
jews
so
hungary
suffers
all
the
injustices
without
defence
all
the
miseries
without
help
and
all
the
intrigues
without
resistance
before
the
war
hungary
had
an
area
almost
equal
to
that
of
italy
square
kilometres
with
a
population
of
inhabitants
the
treaty
of
trianon
reduced
her
territory
to
kilometres
that
is
per
and
the
population
to
or
per
cent
it
was
not
sufficient
to
cut
off
from
hungary
the
populations
which
were
not
ethnically
magyar
without
any
reason
magyars
have
been
handed
over
to
to
to
rumania
also
other
nuclei
of
population
have
been
detached
without
reason
amongst
all
the
belligerents
hungary
perhaps
is
the
country
which
in
comparison
with
the
population
has
had
the
greatest
number
of
dead
the
monarchy
of
the
habsburgs
knew
that
they
could
count
on
the
bravery
of
the
magyars
and
they
sent
them
to
massacre
in
all
the
most
bloody
battles
so
the
little
people
gave
over
dead
and
an
enormous
number
of
injured
and
sick
the
territories
taken
from
hungary
represent
of
her
mineral
wealth
the
production
of
three
million
quintali
tons
of
gold
and
silver
is
entirely
lost
the
great
production
of
salt
is
also
lost
to
her
about
tons
the
production
of
iron
ore
is
reduced
by
per
of
anthracite
by
per
of
lignite
by
per
cent
of
the
factories
hardly
have
remained
to
hungary
more
than
of
the
magnificent
railway
wealth
has
been
given
away
hungary
at
the
same
time
has
lost
her
greater
resources
in
agriculture
and
cattle
breeding
the
capital
henceforth
too
large
for
a
too
small
state
carries
on
amidst
the
greatest
difficulties
and
there
congregate
the
most
pitiable
of
the
transylvanian
refugees
and
those
from
other
lost
regions
the
demographic
structure
of
hungary
which
up
to
a
few
years
ago
was
excellent
is
now
threatening
the
mortality
among
the
children
and
the
mortality
from
tuberculosis
have
become
alarming
at
budapest
even
after
the
war
the
number
of
deaths
surpasses
the
number
of
births
the
statistics
published
by
ferenczi
prove
that
the
number
of
children
afflicted
with
rickets
and
tuberculosis
reaches
in
budapest
the
terrific
figure
of
in
a
population
of
about
two
millions
it
is
said
that
practically
all
the
in
recent
years
partly
through
the
privations
of
the
mothers
and
partly
from
the
lack
of
milk
are
tuberculous
the
conditions
of
life
are
so
serious
that
there
is
no
comparison
some
prices
have
only
risen
five
to
tenfold
but
very
many
from
thirty
to
fifty
and
even
higher
grain
which
before
the
war
cost
crowns
costs
now
crowns
corn
has
passed
from
to
and
crowns
a
kilogram
of
rice
which
used
to
cost
centimes
can
be
found
now
only
at
crowns
sugar
coffee
and
milk
are
at
prices
which
are
absolutely
prohibitive
of
the
financial
situation
it
is
almost
useless
to
speak
the
documents
presented
to
the
conference
of
brussels
are
sad
evidence
and
a
sure
index
is
the
course
of
the
crown
now
so
reduced
as
to
have
hardly
any
value
in
international
relations
the
effective
income
is
more
than
a
fourth
part
of
the
effective
expenses
and
the
rest
is
covered
especially
by
the
circulation
such
is
the
situation
of
hungary
which
has
lost
everything
and
which
suffers
the
most
atrocious
privations
and
the
most
cruel
pangs
of
hunger
in
this
condition
she
should
according
to
the
treaty
of
trianon
not
only
have
sufficient
for
herself
but
pay
indemnities
to
the
enemy
the
hungarian
deputies
at
the
sitting
which
approved
the
treaty
of
trianon
were
clad
in
mourning
and
many
were
weeping
at
the
close
they
all
rose
and
sang
the
national
hymn
a
people
which
is
in
the
condition
of
mind
of
the
magyar
people
can
accept
the
actual
state
of
affairs
as
a
temporary
necessity
but
have
we
any
faith
that
it
will
not
seek
all
occasions
to
retake
what
it
has
unjustly
lost
and
that
in
a
certain
number
of
years
there
will
not
be
new
and
more
terrible
wars
i
can
not
hide
the
profound
emotion
which
i
felt
when
count
apponyi
on
january
before
the
supreme
council
at
paris
gave
the
reasons
of
hungary
you
gentlemen
he
said
whom
victory
has
permitted
to
place
yourselves
in
the
position
of
judges
you
have
pronounced
the
culpability
of
your
late
enemies
and
the
point
of
view
which
directs
you
in
your
resolutions
is
that
of
making
the
consequences
of
the
war
fall
on
those
who
were
responsible
for
it
let
us
examine
now
with
great
serenity
the
conditions
imposed
on
hungary
conditions
which
are
inacceptable
without
the
most
serious
consequences
taking
away
from
hungary
the
larger
part
of
her
territory
the
greater
part
of
her
population
the
greater
portion
of
her
economic
resources
can
this
particular
severity
be
justified
by
the
general
principles
which
inspire
the
entente
hungary
not
having
been
heard
and
was
not
heard
except
to
take
note
of
the
declaration
of
the
head
of
the
delegation
can
not
accept
a
verdict
which
destroys
her
without
explaining
the
reasons
the
figures
furnished
by
the
hungarian
delegation
left
no
doubt
behind
they
treated
of
the
dismemberment
of
hungary
and
the
sacrifice
of
three
millions
and
a
half
of
magyars
and
of
the
german
population
of
hungary
to
people
certainly
more
ignorant
and
less
advanced
at
the
end
apponyi
and
the
hungarian
delegation
did
not
ask
for
anything
more
than
a
plebiscite
for
the
territories
in
dispute
after
he
had
explained
in
a
marvellous
manner
the
great
function
of
historic
hungary
that
of
having
saved
on
various
occasions
europe
from
barbaric
invasion
and
of
having
known
how
to
maintain
its
unity
for
ten
centuries
in
spite
of
the
many
differences
amongst
nations
count
apponyi
showed
how
important
it
was
for
europe
to
have
a
solid
hungary
against
the
spread
of
bolshevism
and
violence
you
can
say
added
apponyi
that
against
all
these
reasons
there
is
only
one
victory
the
right
of
victory
we
know
it
gentlemen
we
are
sufficient
realists
in
politics
to
count
on
this
factor
we
know
what
we
owe
to
victory
and
we
are
ready
to
pay
the
price
of
our
defeat
but
should
this
be
the
sole
principle
of
construction
that
force
alone
should
be
the
basis
of
what
you
would
build
that
force
alone
should
be
the
base
of
the
new
building
that
material
force
alone
should
be
the
power
to
hold
up
those
constructions
which
fall
whilst
you
are
trying
to
build
them
the
future
of
europe
would
then
be
sad
and
we
can
not
believe
it
we
do
not
find
all
that
in
the
mentality
of
the
victorious
nations
we
do
not
find
it
in
the
declarations
in
which
you
have
defined
the
principles
for
which
you
have
fought
and
the
objects
of
the
war
which
you
have
proposed
to
yourselves
and
after
having
referred
to
the
traditions
of
the
past
count
apponyi
added
we
have
faith
in
the
sincerity
of
the
principles
which
you
have
proclaimed
it
would
be
doing
you
injustice
to
think
otherwise
we
have
faith
in
the
moral
forces
with
which
you
have
wished
to
identify
your
cause
and
all
that
i
wish
to
hope
gentlemen
is
that
the
glory
of
your
arms
may
be
surpassed
by
the
glory
of
the
peace
which
you
will
give
to
the
world
the
hungarian
delegation
was
simply
heard
but
the
treaty
which
had
been
previously
prepared
and
was
the
natural
consequence
of
the
treaty
of
versailles
was
in
no
way
modified
an
examination
of
the
treaty
of
trianon
is
superfluous
by
a
stroke
of
irony
the
financial
and
economic
clauses
inflict
the
most
serious
burdens
on
a
country
which
had
lost
almost
everything
which
has
lost
the
greatest
number
of
men
proportionately
in
the
war
which
since
the
war
has
had
two
revolutions
which
for
four
months
suffered
the
sackings
of
bolshevism
led
by
bela
kun
and
the
worst
elements
of
revolutionary
political
crime
and
finally
has
suffered
a
rumanian
occupation
which
was
worse
almost
than
the
revolutions
or
bolshevism
it
is
impossible
to
say
which
of
the
peace
treaties
imposed
on
the
conquered
is
lasting
and
which
is
the
least
supportable
after
the
treaty
of
versailles
all
the
treaties
have
had
the
same
tendency
and
the
same
conformation
the
situation
of
is
now
such
that
she
can
say
with
andromache
let
it
please
god
that
i
have
still
something
more
to
fear
austria
has
lost
everything
and
her
great
capital
which
was
the
most
joyous
in
europe
shelters
now
a
population
whose
resources
are
reduced
to
the
minimum
the
slump
in
her
production
which
is
carried
on
amidst
all
the
difficulties
the
fall
in
her
credit
the
absolute
lack
of
foreign
exchanges
the
difficulty
of
trading
with
the
hostile
populations
which
surround
her
put
austria
in
an
extremely
difficult
position
and
in
progressive
and
continuous
decadence
the
population
especially
in
the
cities
is
compelled
to
the
hardest
privations
the
increase
of
tuberculosis
is
continuous
and
threatening
bulgaria
has
had
rather
less
loss
and
although
large
tracts
of
bulgarian
territory
have
been
given
without
any
justifiable
motive
to
greece
and
and
although
all
outlet
on
the
aegean
has
been
taken
from
her
by
assigning
to
greece
lands
which
she
can
not
maintain
on
the
whole
bulgaria
after
the
treaty
of
neuilly
has
less
sharp
sufferings
than
the
other
conquered
countries
bulgaria
had
a
territorial
extension
of
square
kilometres
she
has
now
lost
about
square
kilometres
she
had
a
population
of
and
has
lost
about
as
for
turkey
if
the
treaties
should
continue
to
exist
she
can
be
considered
as
disappearing
from
europe
and
on
the
road
to
disappear
from
asia
the
turkish
population
has
been
distributed
haphazard
especially
to
greece
or
divided
up
under
the
form
of
mandates
to
countries
of
the
entente
according
to
the
treaty
of
s√®vres
of
august
turkey
abandons
all
her
territory
in
europe
withdrawing
her
frontier
to
the
ciatalgia
lines
turkey
in
europe
is
limited
therefore
to
the
surroundings
of
constantinople
with
little
more
than
square
kilometres
and
a
population
which
is
rather
hard
to
estimate
but
which
is
that
only
of
the
city
and
the
surroundings
perhaps
a
million
and
a
half
men
in
asia
minor
turkey
loses
the
territory
of
the
sanjak
of
smyrna
over
which
however
she
retains
a
purely
nominal
sovereignty
the
territory
still
undefined
of
the
armenian
republic
syria
cilicia
palestine
and
mesopotamia
which
become
independent
under
mandatory
powers
in
arabia
the
territory
of
the
hedjaz
whilst
the
remainder
of
the
peninsula
will
enjoy
almost
complete
independence
besides
constantinople
and
the
straits
are
subject
to
international
control
and
the
three
states
now
the
most
closely
interested
great
britain
france
and
italy
assume
the
control
of
the
finances
and
other
aspects
of
the
ottoman
administration
every
programme
has
ignored
turkey
except
when
the
entente
has
had
opportunity
to
favour
greece
the
greece
of
venezelos
was
the
ward
of
the
entente
almost
more
than
poland
itself
having
participated
in
the
war
to
a
very
small
extent
and
with
almost
insignificant
losses
she
has
after
the
war
almost
trebled
her
territory
and
almost
doubled
her
population
turkey
was
put
entirely
or
almost
so
outside
europe
greece
has
taken
almost
everything
rejected
was
the
idea
of
fixing
the
frontier
on
the
enos
medea
line
and
the
frontier
fixed
at
ciatalgia
constantinople
was
under
the
fire
of
the
greek
artillery
and
constantinople
was
nominally
the
only
city
which
remained
to
turkey
the
sanjak
of
smyrna
in
asia
minor
was
the
true
wealth
of
turkey
it
represented
per
cent
of
the
imports
of
the
turkish
empire
although
the
population
of
the
whole
vilayet
of
audin
and
the
majority
of
the
sanjak
of
smyrna
was
mussulman
greece
had
the
possession
the
whole
of
thrace
was
assigned
to
greece
adrianople
a
city
sacred
to
islam
which
contains
the
tombs
of
the
caliphs
has
passed
to
the
greeks
the
entente
despite
the
resistance
of
some
of
the
heads
of
governments
always
yielded
to
the
requests
of
greece
there
was
a
sentiment
of
antipathy
for
the
turks
and
there
was
a
sympathy
for
the
greeks
there
was
the
idea
to
put
outside
europe
all
mussulman
dominion
and
the
remembrance
of
the
old
propaganda
of
gladstone
and
there
were
the
threats
of
wilson
who
in
one
of
his
proposals
desired
exactly
to
put
turkey
outside
europe
but
above
all
there
was
the
personal
work
of
venezelos
every
request
without
being
even
examined
thoroughly
was
immediately
justified
by
history
statistics
ethnography
in
any
discussion
he
took
care
to
doucement
les
as
often
the
learned
with
few
scruples
do
i
have
met
few
men
in
my
career
who
united
to
an
exalted
patriotism
such
a
profound
ability
as
venezelos
every
time
that
in
a
friendly
way
i
gave
him
counsels
of
moderation
and
showed
him
the
necessity
of
limiting
the
requests
of
greece
i
never
found
a
hard
or
intemperate
spirit
he
knew
how
to
ask
and
obtain
to
profit
by
all
the
circumstances
to
utilize
all
the
resources
better
even
than
the
professional
diplomats
in
asking
he
always
had
the
air
of
offering
and
obtaining
he
appeared
to
be
conceding
something
he
had
at
the
same
time
a
supreme
ability
to
obtain
the
maximum
force
with
the
minimum
of
means
and
a
mobility
of
spirit
almost
surprising
he
saw
no
difficulty
convinced
as
he
was
of
erecting
a
greek
empire
on
the
remnants
of
turkey
every
time
that
doubts
were
expressed
to
him
or
he
was
shown
data
which
should
have
moderated
the
positions
he
denied
the
most
evident
things
he
recognized
no
danger
and
saw
no
difficulty
he
affirmed
always
with
absolute
calm
the
certainty
of
success
it
was
his
opinion
that
the
balkan
peninsula
should
be
in
the
north
under
the
action
of
the
state
and
of
rumania
and
in
the
south
of
greece
but
greece
having
almost
all
the
islands
of
the
aegean
a
part
of
the
territory
of
turkey
and
all
the
ports
in
the
aegean
and
having
the
sanjak
of
smyrna
should
form
a
littoral
empire
of
the
east
and
chase
the
turks
into
the
poorer
districts
of
anatolia
in
the
facility
with
which
the
demands
of
greece
were
accepted
and
in
spite
of
everything
they
were
accepted
even
after
the
fall
of
venezelos
there
was
not
only
a
sympathy
for
greece
but
above
all
the
certainty
that
a
large
greek
army
at
smyrna
would
serve
principally
towards
the
security
of
those
countries
which
have
and
wished
to
consolidate
great
interests
in
asia
minor
as
long
as
the
turks
of
anatolia
were
thinking
specially
about
smyrna
and
could
not
use
her
forces
elsewhere
for
the
same
motive
in
the
last
few
years
all
the
blame
is
attributed
to
the
turks
if
they
have
erred
much
the
errors
even
the
minor
ones
have
been
transformed
into
crimes
the
atrocities
of
the
turks
have
been
described
illustrated
exaggerated
all
the
other
atrocities
often
no
less
serious
have
been
forgotten
or
ignored
the
idea
of
a
hellenic
empire
which
dominates
all
the
coast
of
the
aegean
in
europe
and
asia
encounters
one
fundamental
difficulty
to
dominate
the
coast
it
is
necessary
to
have
the
certainty
of
a
large
hinterland
the
romans
in
order
to
dominate
dalmatia
were
obliged
to
go
as
far
as
the
danube
alexander
the
great
to
have
a
greek
empire
had
above
all
to
provide
for
land
dominion
commercial
colonies
or
penetration
in
isolation
are
certainly
possible
but
vast
political
organizations
are
not
possible
it
is
not
sufficient
to
have
territory
it
is
necessary
to
organize
it
and
regulate
the
life
mankind
does
not
nourish
itself
on
what
it
eats
and
even
less
on
what
it
digests
but
on
what
it
assimilates
historians
of
the
future
will
be
profoundly
surprised
to
learn
that
in
the
name
of
the
principle
of
nationality
the
vilayet
of
adrianople
which
contains
the
city
dearest
to
the
heart
of
islam
after
mecca
was
given
to
the
greeks
according
to
the
very
data
supplied
by
venezelos
there
were
turks
greeks
and
bulgarians
in
truth
the
turks
are
in
much
greater
superiority
the
grand
vizier
of
turkey
in
april
presented
a
note
to
the
ambassadors
of
the
entente
to
revindicate
the
rights
on
certain
vilayets
of
the
turkish
empire
according
to
this
note
in
western
thrace
there
were
inhabitants
of
which
were
mussulmans
in
the
vilayet
of
adrianople
out
of
inhabitants
were
mussulmans
the
population
of
the
vilayet
of
smyrna
is
inhabitants
of
which
are
mussulmans
perhaps
these
statistics
are
biased
but
the
statistics
presented
by
the
opposing
party
were
even
more
fantastic
after
having
had
so
many
territorial
concessions
greece
who
during
the
war
had
enriched
herself
by
commerce
is
obliged
even
after
the
return
of
constantine
who
did
not
know
how
to
resist
the
pressure
to
undertake
most
risky
undertakings
in
asia
minor
and
has
no
way
of
saving
herself
except
by
an
agreement
with
turkey
in
the
illusion
of
conquering
the
turkish
resistance
she
is
now
obliged
to
maintain
an
army
twice
as
big
as
that
of
the
british
empire
the
dreams
of
greatness
increase
some
little
military
success
has
given
greece
the
idea
also
that
the
treaty
of
s√®vres
is
only
a
foundation
regulating
the
relationship
with
the
allies
and
with
the
enemy
and
constituting
for
greece
a
title
of
rights
the
full
possession
of
which
can
not
be
modified
the
war
determines
new
rights
which
can
not
invalidate
the
concessions
already
given
which
on
the
contrary
are
reinforced
and
become
intangible
but
renders
necessary
new
concessions
what
will
happen
whilst
greece
dreams
of
constantinople
and
we
have
disposed
of
constantinople
and
the
straits
turkey
seems
resigned
to
constantinople
itself
a
very
poor
international
city
rather
than
a
turkish
city
the
treaty
of
s√®vres
says
that
it
is
true
that
the
contracting
states
are
in
agreement
in
not
offending
any
of
the
rights
of
the
ottoman
government
on
constantinople
which
remains
the
capital
of
the
turkish
empire
always
under
the
reserve
of
the
dispositions
of
the
treaty
that
is
equivalent
to
saying
of
a
political
regime
that
it
is
a
controlled
liberty
just
as
in
the
time
of
the
tsars
it
was
said
that
there
existed
a
constitutionnelle
sous
un
constantinople
under
the
treaty
of
s√®vres
is
the
free
capital
of
the
turkish
empire
under
the
reserve
of
the
conditions
which
are
contained
in
the
treaty
and
limit
exactly
that
liberty
the
force
of
turkey
has
always
been
in
her
immense
power
of
resistance
win
by
resisting
wear
out
with
the
aid
of
time
which
the
turks
have
considered
not
as
an
economic
value
but
as
their
friend
to
conquer
the
resistance
of
turkey
both
in
the
new
territories
of
europe
and
in
asia
minor
greece
will
have
to
exhaust
the
greater
part
of
her
limited
resources
the
turks
have
always
brought
to
a
standstill
those
who
would
dominate
her
by
a
stubborn
resistance
which
is
fanaticism
and
national
dignity
on
the
other
hand
the
treaty
of
s√®vres
which
has
systematized
in
part
eastern
europe
was
concluded
in
the
absence
of
two
personages
not
to
be
unconsidered
russia
and
germany
the
two
states
which
have
the
greatest
interest
there
germany
the
war
won
as
she
could
not
give
her
explanations
on
the
conclusions
of
peace
was
not
able
to
intervene
in
the
solutions
of
the
question
of
the
orient
russia
was
absent
worn
out
with
the
force
of
a
war
superior
to
her
energies
she
fell
into
convulsions
and
is
now
struggling
between
the
two
misfortunes
of
communism
and
misery
of
which
it
is
hard
to
say
whether
one
or
which
of
the
two
is
the
consequence
of
the
other
one
of
the
most
characteristic
facts
concerns
armenia
the
entente
never
spoke
of
armenia
in
his
fourteen
points
wilson
neither
considered
nor
mentioned
it
it
was
an
argument
difficult
for
the
entente
in
so
far
that
russia
was
straining
in
reality
under
the
necessity
of
protecting
the
christians
to
take
turkish
armenia
without
leaving
russian
armenia
but
suddenly
some
religious
societies
and
some
philanthropic
people
instituted
a
vast
movement
for
the
liberation
of
armenia
nothing
could
be
more
just
than
to
create
a
small
armenian
state
which
would
have
allowed
the
armenians
to
group
themselves
around
lake
van
and
to
affirm
their
national
unity
in
one
free
state
but
here
also
the
hatred
of
the
turks
the
agitation
of
the
greeks
the
dimly
illuminated
philanthropy
determined
a
large
movement
to
form
a
great
state
of
armenia
which
should
have
outlets
on
the
sea
and
great
territories
so
that
no
longer
did
people
talk
of
a
small
state
a
refuge
and
safe
asylum
for
the
armenians
but
of
a
large
state
president
wilson
himself
during
the
conference
of
san
remo
sent
a
message
in
the
form
of
a
recalling
to
mind
if
not
a
reproof
to
the
european
states
of
the
entente
because
they
did
not
proceed
to
the
constitution
of
a
state
of
armenia
it
was
suggested
to
bring
it
down
to
trebizond
to
include
erzeroum
in
the
new
armenia
a
vast
state
of
armenia
in
which
the
armenians
would
have
been
in
the
minority
and
all
that
in
homage
to
historical
tradition
and
for
dislike
of
the
turks
a
great
armenia
creates
also
a
series
of
difficulties
amongst
which
is
that
of
the
relations
between
armenia
georgia
and
azerbajan
supposing
that
in
the
future
these
states
cut
themselves
off
definitely
from
russia
the
great
armenia
would
include
the
vilayet
of
erzeroum
which
is
now
the
centre
of
turkish
nationalism
and
contains
more
mussulmans
than
armenians
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
vilayet
of
erzeroum
has
mussulmans
greeks
and
armenians
when
it
was
a
question
of
giving
greece
territories
in
which
the
greeks
were
in
a
minority
it
was
said
that
the
populations
were
so
badly
governed
by
the
turks
that
they
had
the
right
to
pass
under
a
better
regime
whatever
it
might
be
but
for
a
large
part
of
the
territory
of
the
great
armenia
it
is
possible
to
commit
the
error
of
putting
large
majorities
of
mussulman
people
under
a
hostile
armenian
minority
the
armenians
would
have
to
fight
at
the
same
time
against
the
kurds
and
against
azerbajan
they
are
surrounded
by
enemies
on
all
sides
but
the
whole
of
the
discussion
of
giving
the
vilayet
of
erzeroum
to
armenia
or
leaving
it
to
turkey
is
entirely
superfluous
for
it
is
not
a
question
of
attributing
territory
but
of
determining
actual
situations
if
it
is
desired
to
give
to
the
armenians
the
city
of
erzeroum
it
is
first
of
all
necessary
that
they
shall
be
able
to
enter
and
be
able
to
remain
there
now
since
the
armenians
have
not
shown
with
a
few
exceptions
a
great
power
of
resistance
and
are
rather
a
race
of
merchants
than
warriors
it
would
be
necessary
for
others
to
undertake
the
charge
of
defending
them
none
of
the
european
states
desired
a
mandate
for
armenia
and
no
one
wished
to
assume
the
serious
military
burden
of
protecting
the
armenians
the
united
states
after
having
in
the
message
of
wilson
backed
a
great
armenia
wished
even
less
than
the
other
states
to
interest
themselves
in
it
probably
proposals
of
a
more
reasonable
character
and
marked
by
less
aversion
for
the
turks
would
have
permitted
the
turks
not
only
to
recognize
which
is
not
difficult
for
them
but
in
fact
to
respect
the
new
state
of
armenia
without
the
dreams
of
a
sea
coast
and
the
madness
of
erzeroum
if
the
condition
of
the
conquered
is
sufficiently
serious
the
situation
of
the
peoples
most
favoured
by
the
entente
in
europe
poland
and
greece
who
have
obtained
the
greatest
and
most
unjust
increases
in
territory
having
given
for
a
diversity
of
reasons
extremely
little
during
the
war
is
certainly
not
less
so
each
of
these
countries
are
suffocating
under
the
weight
of
the
concessions
and
seek
in
vain
a
way
of
salvation
from
the
burdens
which
they
are
not
able
to
support
and
from
the
mania
of
conquest
which
are
the
fruits
of
exaltation
and
error
having
obtained
much
having
obtained
far
more
than
they
thought
or
hoped
they
believe
that
their
advantage
lies
in
new
expansion
poland
violates
treaties
offends
the
laws
of
international
usage
and
is
protected
in
everything
she
undertakes
but
every
one
of
her
undertakings
can
only
throw
her
into
greater
discomfort
and
augment
the
total
of
ruin
all
the
violences
in
upper
silesia
to
prevent
the
plebiscite
going
in
favour
of
germany
were
not
only
tolerated
but
prepared
far
ahead
when
i
was
head
of
the
italian
government
the
representative
of
the
german
government
in
rome
von
herf
gave
documentary
evidence
on
what
was
being
prepared
and
on
april
in
an
audience
which
i
gave
him
as
head
of
the
council
he
furnished
me
with
proofs
of
what
was
the
polish
organization
what
were
its
objects
and
the
source
of
its
funds
as
everyone
knows
the
plebiscite
of
march
in
spite
of
the
violence
and
notwithstanding
the
officially
protected
brigandage
resulted
favourably
to
germany
out
of
voters
were
for
germany
and
for
poland
the
richest
most
prosperous
and
most
populous
communes
gave
a
majority
for
the
germans
communes
gave
a
majority
for
poland
the
territory
of
upper
silesia
according
to
the
treaty
according
to
the
plebiscite
according
to
the
most
elementary
international
honesty
should
be
immediately
handed
over
to
germany
but
as
they
do
not
wish
to
give
the
coal
of
upper
silesia
to
germany
and
the
big
interests
of
the
new
great
metallurgical
group
press
and
trick
the
treaty
of
versailles
has
here
also
become
a
de
instead
of
accepting
as
was
the
first
duty
the
result
of
the
plebiscite
people
have
resorted
to
sophism
of
incomparable
weakness
article
of
the
treaty
of
versailles
says
only
that
the
inhabitants
of
upper
silesia
shall
be
called
to
designate
by
means
of
a
plebiscite
if
they
desire
to
be
united
to
germany
or
to
poland
it
was
necessary
to
find
a
sophism
the
addendum
of
section
establishes
how
the
work
of
scrutiny
shall
be
carried
out
and
all
the
procedure
of
the
elections
there
are
six
articles
of
procedure
paragraph
says
that
each
one
shall
vote
in
the
commune
where
he
is
domiciled
or
in
that
where
he
was
born
if
he
has
not
a
domicile
in
the
territory
the
result
of
the
vote
shall
be
determined
commune
by
commune
according
to
the
majority
of
votes
in
each
commune
this
means
then
that
the
results
of
the
voting
as
is
done
in
political
questions
in
all
countries
should
be
controlled
commune
by
commune
it
is
the
form
of
the
scrutiny
which
the
appendix
defines
instead
in
order
to
take
the
coal
away
from
germany
it
was
attempted
and
is
being
still
attempted
not
to
apply
the
treaty
but
to
violate
the
principle
of
the
indivisibility
of
the
territory
and
to
give
the
mining
districts
to
poland
the
violation
of
the
neutrality
of
belgium
was
not
an
offence
to
a
treaty
more
serious
than
this
attempt
the
treaty
of
can
not
be
considered
a
de
more
than
the
treaty
of
versailles
only
the
parties
are
inverted
it
is
not
france
noble
and
democratic
which
inspires
these
movements
but
a
plutocratic
situation
which
has
taken
the
same
positions
but
on
worse
grounds
as
the
german
metallurgists
before
the
war
it
is
the
same
current
against
which
lloyd
george
has
several
times
bitterly
protested
and
for
which
he
has
had
very
bitter
words
which
it
is
not
necessary
to
recall
it
is
the
same
movement
which
has
created
agitations
in
italy
by
means
of
its
organs
and
which
attempt
one
thing
only
to
ruin
the
german
industry
and
having
the
control
of
the
coal
to
monopolize
in
europe
the
iron
industries
and
those
which
are
derived
from
it
first
of
all
in
order
to
indemnify
france
for
the
damages
done
to
the
mines
in
the
north
there
was
the
cession
of
the
mines
of
the
saar
then
there
were
the
repeated
attempts
to
occupy
the
territory
of
the
ruhr
to
control
the
coal
last
of
all
there
is
the
wish
not
to
apply
the
plebiscite
and
to
violate
the
treaty
of
versailles
by
not
giving
upper
silesia
to
germany
but
giving
it
abusively
to
poland
germany
produced
before
the
war
about
tons
of
coal
in
the
consumption
of
these
mines
themselves
was
about
a
tenth
tons
whilst
for
exportation
were
tons
and
for
internal
consumption
were
now
germany
has
lost
and
justly
tons
she
has
lost
and
it
was
not
just
the
saar
tons
she
is
bound
by
the
obligations
of
the
treaty
to
furnish
france
with
tons
and
to
belgium
and
italy
and
france
again
another
tons
if
she
loses
the
excellent
coal
of
upper
silesia
about
tons
per
year
she
will
be
completely
paralysed
it
is
needless
to
lose
time
in
demonstrating
for
what
geographic
ethnographic
and
economist
reason
upper
silesia
should
be
united
with
germany
it
is
a
useless
procedure
and
also
after
the
plebiscites
an
insult
to
the
reasoning
powers
if
the
violation
of
treaties
is
not
a
right
of
the
victor
after
the
plebiscite
in
which
notwithstanding
all
the
violences
of
the
population
voted
for
germany
then
there
is
no
reason
for
discussion
the
words
used
by
lloyd
george
on
may
in
the
house
of
commons
are
a
courteous
abbreviation
of
the
truth
from
the
historical
point
of
view
he
said
poland
has
no
rights
over
silesia
the
only
reason
for
which
poland
could
claim
upper
silesia
is
that
it
possesses
a
numerous
polish
population
arrived
there
in
comparatively
recent
times
with
the
intention
of
finding
work
and
especially
in
the
mines
that
is
true
and
is
more
serious
than
would
be
an
agitation
of
the
italians
in
the
state
of
san
paulo
of
brazil
claiming
that
they
had
a
majority
of
the
population
the
polish
insurrection
said
lloyd
george
justly
is
a
challenge
to
the
treaty
of
versailles
which
at
the
same
time
constitutes
the
charter
of
polish
liberty
poland
is
the
last
country
in
europe
which
has
the
right
to
deplore
the
treaty
because
poland
did
not
conquer
the
treaty
poland
did
not
gain
her
liberty
and
more
than
any
other
country
should
respect
every
comma
of
the
treaty
she
owes
her
liberty
to
italy
great
britain
and
france
in
the
future
said
the
english
prime
minister
force
will
lose
its
efficiency
in
regard
to
the
treaty
of
versailles
and
the
maintenance
of
the
undertakings
on
the
part
of
germany
on
the
basis
of
her
signature
placed
to
the
treaty
will
count
increasingly
we
have
the
right
to
everything
which
she
gives
us
but
we
have
the
right
also
to
leave
everything
which
is
left
to
her
it
is
our
duty
of
impartiality
to
act
with
rigorous
justice
without
taking
into
account
the
advantages
or
the
disadvantages
which
may
accrue
therefrom
either
the
allies
must
demand
that
the
treaty
shall
be
respected
or
they
should
permit
the
germans
to
make
the
poles
respect
it
it
is
all
very
well
to
disarm
germany
but
to
desire
that
even
the
troops
which
she
does
possess
should
not
participate
in
the
of
order
is
a
pure
injustice
russia
added
lloyd
george
is
a
fallen
power
tired
a
prey
to
a
despotism
which
leaves
no
hope
but
is
also
a
country
of
great
natural
resources
inhabited
by
a
people
of
courage
who
at
the
beginning
of
the
war
gave
proof
of
its
courage
russia
will
not
always
find
herself
in
the
position
in
which
she
is
who
can
say
what
she
will
become
in
a
short
time
she
may
become
a
powerful
country
which
can
say
its
word
about
the
future
of
europe
and
the
world
to
which
part
will
she
turn
with
whom
will
she
unite
there
is
nothing
more
just
or
more
true
than
this
but
poland
wants
to
take
away
upper
silesia
from
germany
notwithstanding
the
plebiscite
and
against
the
treaty
and
which
has
in
this
action
the
aid
of
the
metallurgical
interests
and
the
great
interests
of
a
large
portion
of
the
press
of
all
europe
poland
which
has
large
nuclei
of
german
populations
after
having
been
enslaved
claims
the
right
to
enslave
populations
which
are
more
cultured
richer
and
more
advanced
and
besides
the
germans
it
claims
the
right
to
enslave
even
russian
peoples
and
further
to
occupy
entire
russian
territories
and
wishes
to
extend
into
ukraine
there
is
then
the
political
paradox
of
wilna
this
city
which
belongs
according
to
the
regular
treaty
to
lithuania
has
been
occupied
in
an
arbitrary
manner
by
the
poles
who
also
claim
kowno
in
short
poland
which
obtained
her
unity
by
a
miracle
is
working
in
the
most
feverish
manner
to
create
her
own
ruin
she
has
no
finance
she
has
no
administration
she
has
no
credit
she
does
not
work
and
yet
consumes
she
occupies
new
territories
and
ruins
the
old
ones
of
the
inhabitants
as
we
have
seen
millions
are
ukranians
russians
germans
and
nearly
half
a
million
of
other
nationalities
but
among
the
eighteen
or
nineteen
million
poles
there
are
at
least
four
million
jews
polish
jews
without
doubt
but
the
greater
portion
do
not
love
poland
which
has
not
known
how
to
assimilate
them
the
treaty
of
versailles
has
created
the
absurd
position
that
to
go
from
one
part
to
the
other
of
germany
it
is
necessary
to
traverse
the
danzig
corridor
in
other
terms
germany
is
cut
in
two
parts
and
to
move
in
prussia
herself
from
berlin
to
one
of
the
oldest
german
cities
the
home
of
emanuel
kant
konigsberg
it
is
necessary
to
traverse
polish
territory
so
poland
separates
the
two
most
numerous
people
of
europe
russia
and
germany
the
biblical
legend
lets
us
suppose
that
the
waters
of
the
red
sea
opened
to
let
the
chosen
people
pass
but
immediately
afterwards
the
waters
closed
up
again
is
it
possible
to
suppose
that
such
an
arbitrary
arrangement
as
this
will
last
for
long
if
it
has
lasted
as
long
as
it
has
it
is
because
it
was
at
least
from
the
part
of
one
section
of
the
entente
not
the
road
to
peace
but
because
it
was
a
method
of
crushing
down
germany
if
a
people
had
conditions
for
developing
rapidly
it
was
but
also
with
the
intention
of
hurting
germany
and
the
german
peoples
a
state
was
created
which
has
also
its
own
tremendous
crisis
of
nationality
a
with
a
population
of
eight
to
nine
million
people
represented
a
compact
ethnical
unity
instead
they
have
added
five
and
a
half
million
people
of
different
nationalities
amongst
whom
about
germans
with
cities
which
are
the
most
german
in
the
world
as
pilsen
karlsbad
reichenberg
etc
what
is
even
more
serious
is
that
the
germans
are
attached
to
germany
and
having
a
superior
culture
and
civilization
will
never
resign
themselves
to
being
placed
under
the
czeks
had
mineral
riches
industrial
concerns
and
solid
agriculture
and
a
culture
spread
among
the
people
all
the
conditions
for
rising
rapidly
all
these
advantages
risk
being
annulled
by
the
grave
and
useless
insult
to
the
germans
and
magyars
not
only
is
the
situation
of
europe
in
every
way
uncertain
but
there
is
a
tendency
in
the
groups
of
the
victors
on
the
continent
of
europe
to
increase
the
military
budgets
the
relationships
of
trade
are
being
restored
only
slowly
commerce
is
spoken
of
as
an
aim
in
italy
the
dangers
and
perils
of
reopening
trade
with
germany
have
been
seriously
discussed
customs
duties
are
raised
every
day
the
industrial
groups
find
easy
propaganda
for
protection
any
limitation
of
competition
is
a
duty
whether
it
be
the
enemy
of
yesterday
or
the
enemy
of
and
so
the
greatest
evils
of
protection
are
camouflaged
under
patriotism
none
of
the
countries
which
have
come
out
of
the
war
on
the
continent
have
a
financial
position
which
helps
toward
a
solid
situation
all
the
financial
documents
of
the
various
countries
which
i
have
collected
and
studied
with
great
care
contain
enormous
masses
of
expenses
which
are
the
consequences
of
the
war
those
of
the
conquering
countries
also
contain
enormous
aggregations
of
expenses
which
are
or
can
become
the
cause
of
new
wars
the
conquered
countries
have
not
actually
any
finance
germany
has
an
increase
of
expenses
which
the
fall
of
the
mark
renders
more
serious
in
she
spent
not
less
than
milliards
ruining
her
circulation
how
much
has
she
spent
in
austria
and
hungary
have
budgets
which
are
simply
hypotheses
the
last
austrian
budget
for
assigned
a
sum
of
milliards
of
crowns
for
expenses
and
this
for
a
poor
country
with
inhabitants
a
detailed
examination
of
the
financial
situation
of
of
rumania
and
of
the
states
gives
results
which
are
at
the
least
alarming
even
greece
which
until
yesterday
had
a
solid
structure
gallops
now
in
a
madness
of
expenditure
which
exceeds
all
her
resources
and
if
she
does
not
find
a
means
to
make
peace
with
turkey
she
will
find
her
credit
exhausted
the
most
ruinous
of
all
is
the
situation
of
poland
whose
finance
is
certainly
not
better
regulated
than
that
of
the
bolsheviks
of
moscow
to
judge
from
the
course
of
the
polish
mark
and
the
russian
rouble
if
anyone
gets
the
idea
of
buying
them
on
an
international
market
the
situation
of
the
exchange
since
the
war
has
not
sensibly
bettered
even
for
the
great
countries
and
it
is
extraordinarily
worse
for
the
other
countries
in
june
france
had
a
circulation
of
about
milliard
of
francs
belgium
six
milliard
of
francs
italy
of
about
eighteen
milliards
great
britain
between
state
notes
and
bank
of
england
notes
had
hardly
sterling
actually
among
the
continental
countries
surviving
the
war
italy
is
the
country
which
has
made
the
greatest
efforts
not
to
augment
the
circulation
but
to
increase
the
duties
also
because
she
had
no
illusions
of
rebuilding
her
finance
and
her
national
economy
on
an
enemy
indemnity
but
the
conquered
countries
have
so
abused
their
circulation
that
they
almost
live
on
the
thought
of
it
as
in
fact
not
a
few
of
the
conquering
countries
and
those
come
out
from
the
war
do
germany
has
passed
milliards
and
is
rapidly
approaching
one
hundred
milliards
now
when
one
thinks
that
the
united
states
after
so
many
loans
and
after
all
the
expenses
of
the
war
has
only
a
circulation
of
dollars
one
understands
what
difficulty
germany
has
to
produce
to
live
and
to
refurnish
herself
with
raw
materials
only
great
britain
of
all
the
countries
in
europe
which
have
issued
from
the
war
has
had
a
courageous
financial
policy
public
opinion
instead
of
pushing
parliament
to
financial
dissipation
has
insisted
on
economy
if
the
situation
created
by
the
war
has
transformed
also
the
english
circulation
into
unconvertible
paper
money
this
is
merely
a
passing
fact
if
the
sterling
loses
on
the
dollar
that
is
on
gold
given
the
fact
that
the
united
states
of
america
alone
now
have
a
money
at
par
almost
a
quarter
of
its
value
this
is
also
merely
a
transitory
fact
great
britain
has
the
good
sense
to
curtail
expenses
and
the
sterling
tends
always
to
improve
france
and
italy
are
in
an
intermediate
position
their
money
can
be
saved
but
it
will
require
energetic
care
and
great
economies
stern
finance
a
greater
development
of
production
limitation
of
consumption
above
all
of
what
is
purchased
from
abroad
at
the
date
of
which
i
am
writing
expressed
on
a
percentual
basis
the
french
franc
is
worth
centimes
of
the
sterling
and
of
the
dollar
that
is
to
say
of
gold
the
italian
lira
is
worth
centimes
of
the
sterling
and
of
the
dollar
here
are
still
two
countries
in
which
tenacious
energy
can
save
and
with
many
sacrifices
they
can
arrive
at
good
money
france
has
a
good
many
more
resources
than
italy
she
has
a
smaller
need
of
importations
and
a
greater
facility
for
exportations
but
her
public
debt
has
reached
milliards
the
circulation
has
well
passed
milliards
and
they
still
fear
to
calculate
amongst
the
extraordinary
income
of
the
budget
the
fifteen
milliards
a
year
which
should
come
from
germany
italy
with
great
difficulty
of
production
and
less
concord
inside
the
country
has
a
more
true
vision
and
does
not
reckon
any
income
which
is
not
derived
from
her
own
resources
her
circulation
does
not
pass
eighteen
milliards
and
her
debt
exceeds
by
a
little
one
hundred
milliards
with
prudence
and
firmness
france
and
italy
will
be
able
to
balance
their
accounts
but
the
financial
situation
and
the
exchanges
of
the
conquered
countries
even
that
of
germany
may
be
called
desperate
if
expressed
in
percentages
the
german
mark
is
worth
per
cent
in
comparison
with
the
pound
sterling
and
per
cent
of
the
dollar
what
possibility
is
there
of
systematizing
the
exchange
germany
was
compelled
this
year
to
carry
her
expenses
to
milliards
of
marks
as
her
circulation
has
exceeded
milliards
how
can
she
straighten
out
her
money
as
for
the
austrian
and
hungarian
crowns
the
crowns
the
rumanian
lei
and
all
the
other
depreciated
moneys
their
fate
is
not
doubtful
as
their
value
is
always
descending
and
the
gold
equivalent
becomes
almost
indeterminable
they
will
have
a
common
fate
as
for
the
polish
mark
it
can
be
said
that
before
long
it
will
not
be
worth
the
paper
on
which
it
is
printed
there
is
then
the
fantastic
position
of
the
public
debts
they
have
reached
now
such
figures
that
no
imagination
could
have
forecasted
france
alone
has
a
debt
which
of
itself
exceeds
by
a
great
deal
all
the
debts
of
all
the
european
states
previous
to
the
war
milliards
of
francs
and
germany
the
conquered
country
has
in
her
turn
a
debt
which
exceeds
milliards
of
marks
and
which
is
rapidly
approaching
milliards
the
debts
of
many
countries
are
only
recorded
by
feats
of
memory
because
there
is
no
practical
interest
in
knowing
whether
austria
hungary
and
especially
poland
has
one
debt
or
another
since
the
situation
of
the
creditors
is
not
a
situation
of
reality
the
whole
debt
of
the
united
states
of
america
is
after
so
much
war
only
dollars
but
the
united
states
are
creditors
of
the
entente
for
dollars
also
england
against
a
debt
of
sterling
has
a
credit
of
these
serious
figures
whilst
they
increase
the
condition
of
discomfort
rendered
even
more
serious
by
the
scarcity
of
commercial
exchanges
indicate
also
what
necessity
may
be
superior
to
all
in
every
country
to
preserve
internal
peace
produce
more
consume
less
put
the
finances
in
order
and
reconquer
the
credits
instead
the
conquered
countries
are
going
downwards
every
day
and
the
conquering
countries
are
maintaining
very
big
armies
exhausting
their
resources
whilst
they
are
spreading
the
conviction
that
the
indemnity
from
the
enemy
will
compensate
sufficiently
or
at
least
partially
for
the
work
of
restoration
in
fact
the
causes
of
discontent
and
diffidence
are
augmenting
nothing
is
more
significant
than
the
lack
of
conscience
with
which
programmes
of
violence
and
of
ruin
are
lightly
accepted
nothing
is
more
deplorable
than
the
thoughtlessness
with
which
the
germs
of
new
wars
are
cultivated
germany
has
disarmed
with
a
swiftness
which
has
even
astonished
the
military
circles
of
the
entente
but
the
bitter
results
of
the
struggle
are
not
only
not
finished
against
germany
not
even
does
she
form
part
of
the
league
of
nations
which
is
rather
a
sign
of
a
state
of
mind
than
an
advantage
but
the
attitude
towards
her
is
even
more
hostile
two
years
after
the
end
of
the
war
poincar√©
wrote
that
the
league
of
nations
would
lose
its
best
possibility
of
lasting
if
it
did
not
reunite
all
the
nations
of
europe
but
he
added
that
of
all
the
conquered
nations
austria
hungary
bulgaria
turkey
and
germany
the
by
her
conduct
during
the
war
and
after
the
peace
justified
least
a
near
right
of
entry
it
would
be
plus
of
how
many
things
does
nature
occupy
herself
to
let
austria
enter
first
if
she
will
disavow
the
policy
of
reattachment
that
is
being
purely
german
renounce
against
the
principle
of
nationality
in
spite
of
the
principle
of
when
she
can
not
live
alone
to
unite
herself
to
germany
bulgaria
and
turkey
as
long
as
they
had
a
loyal
and
courteous
attitude
towards
greece
rumania
and
serbia
the
turn
of
germany
will
come
but
only
after
turkey
when
she
will
have
given
proof
of
executing
the
treaty
which
no
reasonable
and
honest
person
considers
any
more
executable
in
its
integrity
the
most
characteristic
facts
of
this
peace
which
continues
the
war
can
be
recapitulated
as
follows
europe
on
the
whole
has
more
men
under
arms
than
before
the
war
the
conquered
states
are
forced
to
disarm
but
the
conquering
states
have
increased
the
armaments
the
new
states
and
the
countries
which
have
come
through
the
war
have
increased
their
armaments
production
is
very
tardily
being
taken
up
again
because
there
is
everywhere
if
in
a
different
degree
a
lesser
desire
for
work
on
the
part
of
the
working
classes
joined
with
a
need
for
higher
remuneration
the
difficulties
of
trade
instead
of
decreasing
in
many
countries
of
europe
are
increasing
and
international
commerce
is
very
slowly
recovering
between
the
states
of
europe
there
is
not
a
real
commerce
which
can
compare
with
that
under
normal
conditions
considering
actual
values
with
values
before
the
war
the
products
which
now
form
the
substance
of
trade
between
european
countries
do
not
represent
even
the
half
of
that
before
the
war
as
the
desire
for
consumption
if
not
the
capacity
for
consumption
has
greatly
increased
and
the
production
is
greatly
decreased
all
the
states
have
increased
their
functions
so
the
discredit
of
the
paper
money
and
the
treasury
bills
which
permit
these
heavy
expenses
is
in
all
the
countries
of
europe
even
if
in
different
degrees
very
great
the
conquering
countries
from
the
moment
that
they
had
obtained
in
the
treaties
of
peace
the
acknowledgment
of
the
conquered
that
the
war
was
caused
by
them
held
it
to
be
legitimate
that
they
should
lose
all
their
disposable
goods
their
colonies
their
ships
their
credits
and
their
commercial
organization
abroad
but
that
the
conquered
should
also
pay
all
the
damages
of
the
war
the
war
therefore
should
be
paid
for
by
the
conquered
who
recognized
even
if
against
their
will
that
they
were
alone
responsible
that
forms
henceforth
a
certain
canon
of
foreign
politics
the
less
a
thing
appears
true
the
more
it
is
repeated
although
the
treaties
oblige
austria
hungary
bulgaria
and
turkey
to
pay
the
damages
of
the
war
it
is
however
certain
that
they
are
not
able
to
pay
anything
and
not
even
the
expenses
of
the
victors
on
their
territory
vacuus
coram
latrone
said
juvenal
who
has
nothing
can
give
nothing
and
austria
for
her
part
instead
of
giving
is
imploring
food
succour
so
the
problem
remains
limited
to
germany
can
she
pay
the
indemnity
indicated
in
the
treaty
can
she
pay
for
the
damages
and
indemnify
the
victors
after
having
given
up
her
colonies
her
ships
her
railway
material
all
her
disposable
credits
abroad
in
what
form
can
she
pay
the
fundamental
controversy
reduces
itself
henceforth
only
to
this
point
which
we
shall
try
if
possible
to
make
clear
since
we
desire
that
this
matter
shall
be
presented
in
the
clearest
and
most
evident
form
from
now
on
it
is
not
the
chancelleries
which
must
impose
the
solutions
of
great
problems
but
it
is
the
mass
of
the
public
in
europe
and
america
v
the
anxieties
of
the
victors
we
have
seen
the
process
by
which
the
idea
of
the
indemnity
for
damages
which
was
not
contained
either
in
the
peace
declaration
of
the
entente
nor
in
the
manifestations
of
the
various
parliaments
nor
in
the
first
armistice
proposals
nor
in
the
armistice
between
italy
and
austria
was
introduced
in
the
armistice
with
germany
out
of
pure
regard
for
france
without
taking
heed
of
the
consequences
three
words
said
clemenceau
only
three
words
need
be
added
words
which
compromise
nothing
and
are
an
act
of
deference
to
france
the
entire
construction
of
the
treaties
after
all
is
based
on
those
three
words
and
how
fantastic
the
demands
for
compensation
have
become
an
old
italian
proverb
says
in
time
of
war
there
are
more
lies
than
earth
ancient
and
modern
pottery
reproduce
the
motto
which
is
widespread
and
whose
truth
was
not
understood
until
some
years
ago
so
many
foolish
things
were
said
about
the
almost
mysterious
manoeuvres
of
germany
about
her
vast
expansion
her
great
resources
and
accumulated
capital
that
the
reality
tended
to
become
lost
to
sight
these
absurd
legends
formed
during
the
war
were
not
forgotten
and
there
are
even
now
many
who
believe
in
good
faith
that
germany
can
pay
if
not
twenty
or
milliards
a
year
at
least
eight
or
nine
without
any
difficulty
france
shrewdest
politicians
however
well
knew
that
the
demand
for
an
enormous
and
unlimited
indemnity
was
only
a
means
of
putting
germany
under
control
and
depressing
her
to
the
point
of
exhaustion
but
the
others
maintained
this
proposal
more
out
of
rancour
and
hatred
than
from
any
actual
political
concept
it
may
be
said
that
the
problem
of
the
indemnity
has
never
been
seriously
studied
and
that
the
calculations
the
valuations
the
procedures
have
all
formed
a
series
of
impulsive
acts
by
a
single
error
the
error
of
the
french
politicians
who
had
the
one
aim
of
holding
germany
down
the
procedure
was
simple
in
the
first
phase
the
indemnities
came
into
being
from
three
words
inserted
almost
by
chance
into
the
armistice
treaty
on
november
des
it
was
merely
a
matter
of
a
simple
expression
to
content
public
feeling
supplie
le
conseil
de
se
mettre
dans
de
la
population
it
was
a
moral
concession
a
moral
satisfaction
but
afterwards
as
things
went
on
all
was
altered
when
it
came
to
preparing
the
treaties
for
a
while
the
idea
not
only
of
a
reparation
of
damages
but
of
the
payment
of
the
cost
of
the
war
was
entertained
it
was
maintained
that
the
practice
of
making
the
vanquished
reimburse
the
cost
of
the
war
was
permitted
by
international
law
since
germany
had
provoked
the
war
and
lost
it
she
must
not
only
furnish
an
indemnity
for
the
losses
but
also
pay
the
cost
the
cost
was
calculated
roughly
at
seven
hundred
milliards
of
francs
at
par
further
there
was
the
damage
to
assess
in
the
aggregate
war
costs
damage
to
property
damage
to
persons
came
to
at
least
one
thousand
milliards
but
since
it
was
impossible
to
demand
immediate
payment
and
was
necessary
to
spread
the
sum
over
fifty
years
taking
into
consideration
sinking
funds
and
interest
the
total
came
to
three
thousand
milliards
the
amount
was
published
by
the
illustrated
papers
with
the
usual
diagrams
drawings
of
golden
globes
length
of
paper
money
if
stretched
out
height
of
metal
if
all
piled
up
together
etc
etc
these
figures
were
discussed
for
the
first
few
months
by
a
public
accustomed
to
be
surprised
at
nothing
they
merely
helped
to
demonstrate
that
an
indemnity
of
milliards
was
a
real
sacrifice
for
the
allies
thus
a
whole
series
of
principles
came
to
be
established
which
were
a
contradiction
of
reality
a
great
share
in
the
responsibility
in
this
matter
lies
with
great
britain
who
not
only
followed
france
error
but
in
certain
ways
made
it
worse
by
a
number
of
intemperate
requests
italy
had
no
influence
on
the
proceedings
owing
to
her
indecisive
policy
only
the
united
states
notwithstanding
the
banality
of
some
of
her
experts
a
non
spoke
an
occasional
word
of
reason
when
lloyd
george
understood
the
mistake
committed
in
the
matter
of
the
indemnity
it
was
too
late
the
english
public
found
itself
face
to
face
with
the
elections
almost
the
day
after
the
conclusion
of
the
war
in
the
existing
state
of
exaltation
and
hatred
the
candidates
found
a
convenient
plank
in
promising
the
extermination
of
germany
the
trial
of
the
kaiser
as
well
as
of
thousands
of
german
officers
accused
of
cruelty
and
last
but
not
least
the
end
of
german
competition
the
prime
minister
of
australia
william
morris
hughes
a
insensitive
violent
man
directed
a
furious
campaign
in
favour
of
a
huge
indemnity
lord
northcliffe
lent
the
aid
of
his
numerous
papers
to
this
campaign
which
stirred
up
the
electors
lloyd
george
with
his
admirable
intelligence
perceived
the
situation
clearly
he
did
not
believe
in
the
usefulness
or
even
in
the
possibility
of
trying
the
kaiser
and
the
german
officers
he
did
not
believe
in
the
possibility
of
an
enormous
indemnity
or
even
a
very
large
one
his
first
statements
like
those
of
bonar
law
a
serious
honest
man
an
idealist
with
the
appearance
of
a
practical
person
revealed
nothing
on
the
eve
of
the
dissolution
of
parliament
lloyd
george
speaking
at
wolverhampton
november
did
not
even
hint
at
the
question
of
the
reparations
or
indemnity
he
was
impelled
along
that
track
by
the
movement
coming
from
france
by
the
behaviour
of
the
candidates
by
hughes
attitude
and
by
the
press
generally
especially
that
of
northcliffe
a
most
vulgar
spectacle
was
offered
by
many
of
the
english
candidates
among
whom
were
several
members
of
the
war
cabinet
who
used
language
worthy
of
raving
dervishes
before
crowds
hypnotized
by
promises
of
the
most
impossible
things
to
promise
the
electors
that
germany
should
pay
the
cost
of
the
war
to
announce
to
those
who
had
lost
their
senses
that
the
kaiser
was
to
be
hanged
to
promise
the
arrest
and
punishment
of
the
most
guilty
german
officers
to
prophesy
the
reduction
to
slavery
of
a
germany
competing
on
sea
and
land
was
certainly
the
easiest
kind
of
electoral
programme
the
numerous
accepted
it
with
much
enthusiasm
and
the
people
listened
to
the
endless
series
of
promises
hughes
who
was
at
bottom
in
good
faith
developed
the
thesis
which
he
afterwards
upheld
at
paris
with
logical
precision
it
was
duty
to
reimburse
without
any
limitation
the
entire
cost
of
the
war
damage
to
property
damage
to
persons
and
he
who
has
committed
the
wrong
must
make
reparation
for
it
to
the
extreme
limits
of
his
resources
and
this
principle
recognized
by
the
jurists
requires
that
the
total
of
the
whole
cost
of
the
war
fall
upon
the
enemy
nations
later
on
hughes
who
was
a
sincere
man
recognized
that
it
was
not
possible
to
go
beyond
asking
for
reparation
of
the
damages
lloyd
george
was
dragged
along
by
the
necessity
of
not
drawing
away
the
mass
of
the
electors
from
the
candidates
of
his
party
thus
he
was
obliged
on
december
in
his
final
manifesto
to
announce
not
only
the
kaiser
trial
and
that
of
all
those
responsible
for
atrocities
but
to
promise
the
most
extensive
kind
of
indemnity
from
germany
and
the
compensation
of
all
who
had
suffered
by
the
war
speaking
the
same
evening
at
bristol
he
promised
to
uphold
the
principle
of
the
indemnity
and
asserted
the
absolute
right
to
demand
from
germany
payment
for
the
costs
of
the
war
in
england
where
the
illusion
soon
passed
away
in
france
where
it
has
not
yet
been
dissipated
the
public
has
been
allowed
to
believe
that
germany
can
pay
the
greater
part
if
not
the
entire
cost
of
the
war
or
at
least
make
compensation
for
the
damage
for
many
years
i
have
studied
the
figures
in
relation
to
private
wealth
and
the
wealth
of
nations
and
i
have
written
at
length
on
the
subject
i
know
how
difficult
it
is
to
obtain
by
means
of
even
approximate
statistics
results
more
or
less
near
to
the
reality
nothing
pained
me
more
than
to
hear
the
facility
with
which
politicians
of
repute
spoke
of
obtaining
an
indemnity
of
hundreds
of
milliards
when
germany
expressed
her
desire
to
pay
an
indemnity
in
one
agreed
lump
sum
of
one
hundred
milliards
of
gold
marks
an
indemnity
she
could
never
pay
so
enormous
is
it
i
saw
statesmen
whom
i
imagined
not
deprived
of
intelligence
smile
at
the
paltriness
of
the
offer
an
indemnity
of
fifty
milliards
of
gold
marks
such
as
that
proposed
by
keynes
appeared
absurd
in
its
smallness
when
the
peace
conference
reassembled
in
paris
the
situation
concerning
the
indemnity
was
as
follows
the
entente
had
never
during
the
war
spoken
of
indemnity
as
a
condition
of
peace
wilson
in
his
proposals
had
spoken
only
of
reconstruction
of
invaded
territories
the
request
for
des
had
been
included
in
the
terms
of
the
armistice
merely
to
afford
a
moral
satisfaction
to
france
but
the
campaign
waged
in
france
and
during
the
elections
in
england
had
exaggerated
the
demands
so
as
to
include
not
only
reparation
for
damage
but
reimbursement
of
the
cost
of
the
war
only
the
united
states
maintained
that
the
indemnity
should
be
limited
to
the
reparation
of
the
damages
a
reparation
which
in
later
phases
included
not
only
reconstruction
of
destroyed
territories
and
damage
done
to
private
property
but
even
pensions
to
the
families
of
those
dead
in
the
war
and
the
sums
in
grant
paid
during
it
when
prussia
beat
france
in
she
asked
for
an
indemnity
of
five
milliards
the
entente
could
have
demanded
from
the
vanquished
an
indemnity
and
then
have
reassumed
relations
with
them
provided
it
were
an
indemnity
which
they
could
pay
in
a
brief
period
of
time
instead
it
being
impossible
to
demand
an
enormous
sum
of
or
milliards
a
difficult
figure
to
fix
definitely
recourse
was
had
to
another
expedient
from
the
moment
that
the
phrase
des
was
included
in
the
armistice
treaty
as
a
claim
that
could
be
urged
it
became
impossible
to
ask
for
a
fixed
sum
what
was
to
be
asked
for
was
neither
more
nor
less
than
the
amount
of
the
damages
hence
a
special
commission
was
required
and
the
reparations
commission
appears
on
the
scene
to
decide
the
sum
to
demand
from
germany
and
to
control
its
payment
also
even
after
germany
was
disarmed
a
portion
of
her
territory
must
remain
in
the
allies
hands
as
a
guarantee
for
the
execution
of
the
treaty
the
reason
why
france
has
always
been
opposed
to
a
rapid
conclusion
of
the
indemnity
question
is
that
she
may
continue
to
have
the
right
in
view
of
the
question
remaining
still
open
to
occupy
the
left
bank
of
the
rhine
and
to
keep
the
bridgeheads
indicated
in
the
treaty
the
thesis
supported
by
clemenceau
at
the
conference
was
a
simple
one
germany
must
recognize
the
total
amount
of
her
debt
it
is
not
enough
to
say
that
we
recognize
it
i
demand
in
the
name
of
the
french
government
and
after
having
consulted
my
colleagues
that
the
peace
treaty
fixes
germany
debt
to
us
and
indicates
the
nature
of
the
damages
for
which
reparation
is
due
we
will
fix
a
period
of
thirty
years
if
you
so
wish
it
and
we
will
give
to
the
commission
after
it
has
reduced
the
debt
to
figures
the
mandate
to
make
germany
pay
within
these
thirty
years
all
she
owes
us
if
the
whole
debt
can
not
be
paid
in
thirty
years
the
commission
will
have
the
right
to
extend
the
time
for
payment
this
scheme
was
agreed
and
the
thesis
of
the
compensation
of
damages
instead
of
that
for
the
payment
of
the
cost
of
the
war
prevailed
for
a
very
simple
reason
if
they
proposed
to
demand
for
all
integral
reparations
and
therefore
the
reimbursement
of
the
cost
of
the
war
the
figures
would
have
been
enormous
it
became
necessary
to
reduce
all
the
credits
proportionally
as
in
the
case
of
a
bankruptcy
now
since
in
the
matter
of
the
indemnities
france
occupied
the
first
place
to
begin
with
she
asked
per
cent
of
all
sums
paid
by
germany
she
took
the
greater
part
of
the
indemnities
while
on
the
sums
paid
for
reimbursement
of
cost
of
war
she
would
only
have
got
less
than
twenty
per
cent
germany
has
therefore
been
put
under
control
for
all
the
time
she
will
be
paying
the
indemnities
that
is
for
an
indefinite
time
the
valuation
of
the
expenses
for
the
reconstruction
of
the
ruined
territories
had
to
be
carried
out
according
to
the
regulations
of
the
treaty
and
the
prices
having
increased
the
french
government
presented
in
july
a
first
approximate
valuation
damages
milliards
pensions
milliards
in
all
milliards
in
november
the
damages
had
increased
to
milliards
even
these
figures
represent
something
less
absurd
than
the
first
demands
and
figures
on
september
the
french
minister
of
finance
speaking
in
the
french
chamber
calculated
the
total
of
the
german
indemnities
arising
from
the
treaty
at
milliards
whose
interest
would
accumulate
until
after
which
date
germany
would
begin
to
pay
her
debt
in
annual
rates
of
about
milliards
each
and
milliards
a
year
would
go
to
france
again
in
november
ogier
minister
of
the
liberated
regions
put
before
the
reparations
commission
in
the
name
of
france
a
detailed
memorial
which
made
the
value
of
the
territories
to
be
reconstructed
only
for
the
cases
of
private
individuals
come
to
milliards
not
including
the
pensions
damage
to
railways
and
mercantile
marine
which
totalled
milliards
of
which
milliards
were
for
pensions
and
milliards
for
damages
of
late
the
sense
of
reality
has
begun
to
diffuse
itself
the
minister
loucheur
himself
has
laughed
at
the
earlier
figures
and
has
stated
that
the
damages
do
not
exceed
eighty
milliards
but
the
french
public
has
been
accustomed
for
some
time
to
take
the
figures
of
klotz
seriously
and
to
discuss
indemnities
of
and
milliards
the
public
however
is
not
yet
aware
of
the
real
position
and
will
not
be
able
to
arrive
at
a
just
realization
of
it
without
passing
through
a
serious
moral
crisis
which
will
be
the
first
secure
element
of
the
real
peace
setting
aside
all
questions
of
indemnities
from
turkey
and
bulgaria
they
have
nothing
to
give
can
give
nothing
on
the
contrary
they
ask
and
merit
assistance
it
is
clear
that
all
the
indemnities
must
be
paid
by
germany
the
french
totals
of
the
material
damage
claims
in
the
invaded
districts
have
been
absolutely
fantastic
and
more
exaggerated
than
in
the
case
of
belgium
whose
indemnity
claims
would
lead
one
to
suppose
the
total
destruction
of
at
least
the
third
part
of
her
territory
almost
as
if
she
had
undergone
the
submersion
of
say
ten
thousand
square
metres
of
her
small
territory
this
problem
of
the
indemnities
limited
to
the
reparation
of
damages
and
in
accordance
with
the
costs
contemplated
in
the
treaty
of
versailles
has
never
been
seriously
tackled
one
may
even
say
it
has
not
been
seriously
examined
and
it
is
deplorable
that
there
has
been
created
among
the
public
or
among
a
large
part
of
it
the
conviction
that
germany
will
repair
the
damage
of
the
war
by
her
own
effort
this
idea
however
finds
no
acceptance
in
england
among
serious
persons
and
in
italy
no
one
believes
in
it
but
in
france
and
belgium
the
idea
is
widely
diffused
and
the
wish
to
spread
the
belief
is
lively
in
several
sections
of
opinion
not
because
intelligent
people
believe
in
the
possibility
of
effective
payment
but
with
the
idea
of
putting
germany
in
the
light
of
not
maintaining
the
clauses
of
the
peace
thus
extending
the
right
to
prolong
the
military
occupation
and
even
to
aggravate
it
germany
thereby
is
kept
out
of
the
league
of
nations
and
her
dissolution
facilitated
john
maynard
keynes
ever
since
the
end
of
has
shown
in
his
admirable
book
the
absurdity
of
asking
for
vast
indemnities
impossibility
of
paying
them
and
the
risk
for
all
europe
of
following
a
road
leading
to
ruin
thus
at
the
same
time
accentuating
the
work
of
disintegration
started
by
the
treaty
that
book
had
awakened
a
echo
but
it
ought
to
have
had
a
still
wider
one
and
would
have
done
but
for
the
fact
that
unfortunately
the
press
in
free
countries
is
anything
but
free
the
great
industrial
syndicates
especially
in
the
industry
which
control
so
large
a
part
of
the
press
among
the
majority
of
the
states
of
europe
and
even
beyond
europe
find
easy
allies
in
the
inadequate
preparation
of
the
major
part
of
the
journalists
to
discuss
the
most
important
problems
and
the
indisposition
on
the
part
of
the
public
to
examine
those
questions
which
present
difficulties
and
are
so
rendered
less
convenient
for
discussion
i
knew
keynes
during
the
war
when
he
was
attached
to
the
british
treasury
and
chief
of
the
department
charged
to
look
after
the
foreign
exchanges
and
the
financial
relations
between
great
britain
and
her
allies
a
serious
writer
a
teacher
of
economics
of
considerable
value
he
brought
to
his
difficult
task
a
scrupulousness
and
an
exactness
that
bordered
on
mistrust
being
at
that
time
chancellor
of
the
exchequer
in
italy
in
the
bitterest
and
most
decisive
period
of
the
war
i
had
frequent
contact
with
keynes
and
i
always
admired
his
exactness
and
his
precision
i
could
not
always
find
it
in
myself
to
praise
his
friendly
spirit
but
he
had
an
almost
mystic
force
of
severity
and
those
enormous
squanderings
of
wealth
that
facile
assumption
of
liabilities
that
characterized
this
period
of
the
war
must
have
doubtless
produced
in
him
a
sense
of
infinite
disgust
this
state
of
mind
often
made
him
very
exigent
and
sometimes
unjustifiably
suspicious
his
word
had
a
decisive
effect
on
the
actions
of
the
english
treasury
when
the
war
was
finished
he
took
part
as
first
delegate
of
the
english
treasury
at
the
peace
conference
of
paris
and
was
substituted
by
the
chancellor
of
the
exchequer
in
the
supreme
economic
council
he
quitted
his
office
when
he
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
it
was
hopeless
to
look
for
any
fundamental
change
of
the
peace
treaties
his
book
is
not
only
a
document
of
political
uprightness
but
the
first
appeal
to
a
sense
of
reality
which
after
an
orgy
of
mistakes
menaces
a
succession
of
catastrophes
in
my
opinion
it
merits
a
serious
reconsideration
as
the
expression
of
a
new
conscience
as
well
as
an
expression
of
the
truth
which
is
only
disguised
by
the
existing
state
of
exasperation
and
violence
after
two
years
we
must
recognize
that
all
the
forecasts
of
keynes
have
been
borne
out
by
the
facts
that
the
exchange
question
has
grown
worse
in
all
the
countries
who
have
been
in
the
war
that
the
absurd
indemnities
imposed
on
the
enemies
can
not
be
paid
that
the
depressed
condition
of
the
vanquished
is
harmful
to
the
victors
almost
in
equal
measure
with
the
vanquished
themselves
that
it
menaces
their
very
existence
that
in
fine
the
sense
of
dissolution
is
more
widespread
than
ever
the
moment
has
come
to
make
an
objective
examination
of
the
indemnity
question
and
to
discuss
it
without
any
hesitation
let
us
lay
aside
all
sentiment
and
forget
the
undertakings
of
the
peace
treaties
let
us
suppose
that
the
entente
declarations
and
wilson
proposals
never
happened
let
us
imagine
that
we
are
examining
a
simple
commercial
proposition
stripped
of
all
sentiment
and
moral
ideas
after
a
great
war
it
is
useless
to
invoke
moral
sentiments
men
while
they
are
blinded
by
hatred
recognize
nothing
save
their
passion
it
is
the
nature
of
war
not
only
to
kill
or
ruin
a
great
number
of
men
not
only
to
cause
considerable
material
damage
but
also
necessarily
to
bring
about
states
of
mind
full
of
hate
which
can
not
be
ended
at
once
and
which
are
even
refractory
to
the
language
of
reason
for
a
long
time
i
myself
have
looked
upon
the
germans
with
the
profoundest
hatred
when
i
think
of
all
the
persons
of
my
race
dead
in
the
war
when
i
look
back
upon
the
fifteen
months
of
anguish
when
my
son
was
a
prisoner
of
war
in
germany
i
am
quite
able
to
understand
the
state
of
mind
of
those
who
made
the
peace
and
the
mental
condition
in
which
it
was
made
what
determined
the
atmosphere
of
the
peace
treaties
was
the
fact
that
there
was
a
conference
presided
over
by
clemenceau
who
remembered
the
prussians
in
the
streets
of
paris
after
the
war
of
who
desired
but
one
thing
the
extermination
of
the
germans
what
created
this
atmosphere
or
helped
to
create
it
was
the
action
of
marshal
foch
who
had
lost
in
the
war
the
two
persons
dearest
to
him
in
life
the
persons
who
attached
him
to
existence
but
now
we
must
examine
the
question
not
in
the
light
of
our
sentiments
or
even
of
our
hatreds
we
must
see
quite
calmly
if
the
treaties
are
possible
of
application
without
causing
the
ruin
of
the
vanquished
then
we
must
ask
ourselves
if
the
ruin
of
the
vanquished
does
not
bring
in
its
train
the
ruin
of
the
victors
putting
aside
then
all
moral
considerations
let
us
examine
and
value
the
economic
facts
there
is
no
question
that
the
reparation
problem
exists
solely
in
the
case
of
germany
who
has
still
a
powerful
statal
framework
which
allows
her
to
maintain
great
efforts
capable
not
only
of
providing
her
with
the
means
of
subsistence
but
also
of
paying
a
large
indemnity
to
the
victors
the
other
vanquished
states
are
more
in
need
of
succour
than
anything
else
what
are
the
reparations
let
us
follow
the
of
them
which
a
representative
of
france
made
at
the
signing
of
the
treaty
of
versailles
they
are
as
follows
germany
is
responsible
for
the
total
of
the
losses
and
damages
sustained
by
her
victors
inasmuch
as
she
caused
them
germany
in
consideration
of
the
permanent
diminution
of
her
resources
resulting
from
the
peace
treaty
is
only
obliged
but
is
obliged
without
restitutions
or
reserves
to
reimburse
the
direct
damages
and
the
pensions
as
precised
in
schedule
i
of
clause
viii
of
the
treaty
germany
must
pay
before
may
not
less
than
twenty
milliards
of
gold
marks
or
make
equivalent
payment
in
kind
on
may
the
reparations
commission
will
fix
the
total
amount
of
the
german
debt
this
debt
must
be
liquidated
by
annual
payments
whose
totals
are
to
be
fixed
by
the
commission
the
payments
will
continue
for
a
period
of
thirty
years
or
longer
if
by
that
time
the
debt
is
not
extinguished
germany
will
issue
one
hundred
milliards
of
gold
marks
of
bearer
bonds
and
afterwards
all
such
issues
as
the
reparations
commission
shall
demand
until
the
amount
of
the
debt
be
reached
in
order
to
permit
the
stabilization
of
credit
the
payments
will
be
made
in
money
and
in
kind
the
payments
in
kind
will
be
made
in
coal
live
stock
chemical
products
ships
machines
furniture
etc
the
payments
consist
of
metal
money
of
germany
credits
public
and
private
abroad
and
of
a
first
charge
on
all
the
effects
and
resources
of
the
empire
and
the
german
states
the
reparations
commission
charged
with
seeing
to
the
execution
of
this
clause
shall
have
powers
of
control
and
decision
it
will
be
a
commission
for
germany
debt
with
wider
powers
called
upon
to
decide
according
to
equity
justice
and
good
faith
without
being
bound
by
any
codex
or
special
legislation
it
has
obtained
from
germany
an
irrevocable
recognition
of
its
authority
its
duty
is
to
supervise
until
the
extinction
of
the
debt
germany
situation
her
financial
operations
her
effects
her
capacity
for
production
her
provisioning
her
production
this
commission
must
decide
what
germany
can
pay
each
year
and
must
see
that
her
payments
added
to
the
budget
fall
upon
her
taxpayers
at
least
to
the
extent
of
the
allied
country
most
heavily
taxed
its
decisions
shall
be
carried
out
immediately
and
receive
immediate
application
without
any
other
formality
the
commission
can
effect
all
the
changes
deemed
necessary
in
the
german
laws
and
regulations
as
well
as
all
the
sanctions
whether
of
a
financial
economic
or
military
nature
arising
from
established
violations
of
the
clauses
put
under
its
control
and
germany
is
obliged
not
to
consider
these
sanctions
as
hostile
acts
in
order
to
guarantee
the
payments
an
army
in
reality
a
army
occupies
the
left
bank
of
the
rhine
and
is
stationed
at
the
bridgeheads
germany
is
completely
helpless
and
has
lost
all
the
features
of
a
sovereign
state
inasmuch
as
she
is
subject
to
controls
in
a
way
that
turkey
never
was
in
modern
history
we
can
find
no
parallel
for
this
state
of
things
these
are
conditions
which
alter
the
very
bases
of
civilization
and
the
relations
between
peoples
such
procedure
has
been
unknown
in
europe
for
centuries
the
public
has
become
accustomed
in
certain
countries
to
consider
responsible
for
the
war
not
the
government
that
wished
it
or
the
german
people
but
the
future
generations
thus
the
indemnities
are
to
be
paid
were
such
conditions
possible
in
thirty
years
and
for
at
least
twenty
years
afterwards
by
people
still
unborn
at
the
time
of
the
war
this
cursing
of
the
guilty
people
has
no
parallel
in
modern
history
we
must
go
back
to
the
early
ages
of
humanity
to
find
anything
of
the
kind
but
even
the
most
inhuman
policies
such
as
germany
has
never
adopted
in
her
victories
although
she
has
been
accused
of
every
cruelty
can
find
at
least
some
justification
if
they
had
a
useful
effect
on
the
country
which
has
wished
and
accepts
responsibility
for
them
the
conqueror
has
his
rights
julius
caesar
killed
millions
of
germans
and
retarded
perhaps
for
some
centuries
the
invasion
of
rome
but
the
practices
established
by
the
treaty
of
versailles
are
in
effect
equally
harmful
to
victors
and
vanquished
though
maybe
in
unequal
measure
and
in
any
case
prepare
the
dissolution
of
europe
i
had
my
share
in
arranging
at
san
remo
the
spa
conference
in
the
hope
and
with
the
desire
of
discussing
frankly
with
the
germans
what
sum
they
could
pay
by
way
of
indemnity
without
upsetting
their
economy
and
damaging
severely
that
of
the
allies
but
the
ministerial
crisis
which
took
place
in
june
prevented
me
from
participating
at
the
spa
conference
and
the
profitable
action
which
great
britain
had
agreed
to
initiate
in
the
common
interest
ours
as
well
as
france
could
not
be
proceeded
with
the
old
mistakes
continued
to
be
repeated
though
many
attenuations
have
come
about
and
the
truth
begins
to
appear
even
for
those
most
responsible
for
past
errors
we
shall
have
to
examine
with
all
if
germany
is
in
a
position
to
pay
in
whole
or
in
part
the
indemnity
established
or
rather
resulting
from
the
treaty
france
especially
believes
or
has
said
on
several
occasions
she
believes
that
germany
can
pay
without
difficulty
milliards
after
many
stupidities
and
many
exaggerations
which
have
helped
considerably
to
confuse
the
public
in
face
of
the
new
difficulties
which
have
arisen
new
arrangements
for
the
payment
of
the
indemnity
have
been
established
on
may
in
face
of
the
situation
which
had
arisen
the
allies
proposed
and
germany
accepted
a
fresh
scheme
for
the
payment
of
the
reparations
germany
is
constrained
to
pay
every
year
in
cash
and
in
kind
the
equivalent
of
million
dollars
plus
per
cent
of
the
total
of
her
exports
the
rest
of
the
accord
refers
to
the
procedure
for
the
issue
of
bonds
guaranteed
on
the
indicated
payments
to
the
constitution
of
a
guarantee
committee
and
to
the
date
of
payment
probably
germany
will
have
been
able
to
get
through
the
year
without
insurmountable
difficulties
at
spa
on
april
the
proportionate
sums
assessed
for
each
of
the
conquering
powers
were
established
on
a
total
indemnity
notably
reduced
in
comparison
with
the
earlier
absurd
demands
but
leaving
alone
the
idea
of
an
indemnity
of
or
even
milliards
of
gold
marks
it
will
be
well
to
see
in
a
concrete
form
what
germany
can
be
made
to
pay
and
whether
the
useless
and
elaborate
structure
of
the
reparations
commission
which
with
its
powers
of
regulating
the
internal
life
of
germany
for
thirty
years
or
more
ought
not
to
be
substituted
by
a
simpler
formula
more
in
sympathy
with
civilized
notions
shortly
before
the
war
according
to
successive
statistics
the
private
wealth
of
france
did
not
amount
to
more
than
milliards
the
wealth
of
france
according
to
successive
valuations
was
calculated
at
milliards
of
francs
in
de
foville
at
milliards
in
turquan
at
about
milliards
according
to
other
authors
the
wealth
of
belgium
according
to
official
statistics
published
by
the
belgian
ministry
of
finance
in
amounted
to
rather
less
than
milliards
of
francs
the
estimate
is
perhaps
a
trifle
low
but
this
official
figure
must
not
be
considered
as
being
a
long
way
from
the
truth
at
certain
moments
belgium
demands
have
surpassed
even
the
total
of
her
national
wealth
while
the
damages
have
not
been
more
than
some
milliards
the
value
of
the
land
in
france
was
calculated
before
the
war
at
between
and
milliards
the
value
of
the
buildings
according
to
statistique
de
la
at
milliards
the
territory
occupied
by
the
germans
is
not
more
than
a
tenth
of
the
national
territory
even
taking
into
consideration
the
loss
of
industrial
buildings
it
is
very
difficult
to
arrive
at
the
figure
of
milliards
at
the
same
time
it
is
true
that
the
minister
loucheur
declared
on
february
in
the
french
chamber
that
the
reconstruction
of
the
devastated
regions
in
france
required
milliards
that
is
very
much
more
than
double
the
private
wealth
of
all
the
inhabitants
of
all
the
occupied
regions
in
all
the
demands
for
compensation
of
the
various
states
we
have
seen
not
so
much
a
real
and
precise
estimate
of
the
damages
as
a
kind
of
fixing
of
credit
in
the
largest
measure
possible
in
order
that
in
the
successive
reductions
each
state
should
still
have
proportionally
an
advantageous
position
making
his
calculation
with
a
generosity
which
i
assert
to
be
excessive
and
i
assert
this
as
a
result
of
an
accurate
study
of
the
question
which
perhaps
i
may
have
occasion
to
publish
keynes
maintains
that
the
damages
for
which
germany
should
be
made
to
pay
come
to
milliards
for
all
losses
on
land
and
sea
and
for
the
effects
of
aerial
bombardments
milliards
of
francs
all
told
including
the
damages
of
france
great
britain
italy
belgium
serbia
i
do
not
believe
that
the
damages
reach
milliards
of
gold
marks
unless
of
course
we
calculate
in
them
the
pensions
and
allowances
but
these
figures
have
but
small
interest
since
the
demands
have
been
almost
entirely
purely
arbitrary
what
we
must
see
is
if
germany
can
pay
and
if
with
a
regime
of
restrictions
and
violence
she
can
hand
over
not
the
many
milliards
which
have
been
announced
and
which
have
been
a
deplorable
speculation
on
the
ignorance
of
the
public
but
a
considerable
sum
such
as
is
that
which
many
folk
still
delude
themselves
it
is
possible
to
have
germany
has
already
consigned
all
her
transferable
wealth
the
gold
in
her
banks
her
colonies
her
commercial
fleet
a
large
and
even
the
best
part
of
her
railway
material
her
submarine
cables
her
foreign
credits
the
property
of
her
private
citizens
in
the
victorious
countries
etc
everything
that
could
be
handed
over
even
in
opposition
to
the
rights
of
nations
as
such
are
known
in
modern
civilized
states
germany
has
given
she
has
also
hypothecated
all
her
national
goods
what
can
she
give
now
germany
can
pay
in
three
ways
only
merchandise
and
food
products
on
account
of
the
indemnity
coal
machines
chemical
products
etc
credits
abroad
coming
from
the
sale
of
merchandise
if
germany
exports
that
is
sells
eight
milliard
marks
worth
of
goods
abroad
she
pays
two
milliards
to
the
reparations
commission
property
of
private
citizens
germany
can
enslave
herself
ceding
the
property
of
her
private
citizens
to
foreign
states
or
citizens
to
be
disposed
of
as
they
wish
excluding
this
last
form
which
would
constitute
slavery
pure
and
simple
as
useless
as
impossible
and
calculated
to
parallel
the
methods
in
use
among
barbarous
peoples
there
only
remain
the
first
two
methods
of
payment
which
we
will
examine
briefly
it
must
be
remembered
that
germany
even
before
the
war
was
in
difficulties
for
insufficient
avenues
of
development
given
the
restricted
nature
of
her
territory
and
the
exuberance
of
her
population
her
territory
smaller
than
that
of
france
and
much
less
fertile
must
now
nourish
a
population
which
stands
to
that
of
france
as
three
to
two
if
we
have
had
gigantic
war
losses
germany
who
fought
on
all
the
fronts
has
had
losses
certainly
not
inferior
to
ours
she
too
has
had
in
larger
or
smaller
proportion
her
dead
and
her
mutilated
she
has
known
the
most
atrocious
sufferings
from
hunger
thus
her
productive
power
is
much
diminished
not
only
on
account
of
the
grave
difficulties
in
which
her
people
find
themselves
and
the
development
of
tuberculosis
is
a
terrible
index
but
also
for
the
lowered
productive
capacity
of
her
working
classes
the
statistics
published
by
the
office
of
public
health
of
the
empire
and
those
given
in
england
by
professor
starling
and
laid
before
the
british
parliament
leave
no
doubt
in
the
matter
germany
has
had
more
than
dead
and
many
more
than
of
wounded
she
has
her
mass
of
orphans
widows
and
invalids
taken
altogether
the
structure
of
her
people
has
become
much
worse
what
constituted
the
great
productive
force
of
the
german
people
was
not
only
its
capacity
to
work
but
the
industrial
organization
which
she
had
created
with
fifty
years
of
effort
at
home
and
abroad
with
many
sacrifices
now
germany
has
not
only
lost
per
cent
of
her
population
but
per
cent
of
her
territory
from
which
cereals
and
potatoes
were
produced
and
to
per
cent
of
her
live
stock
etc
we
have
already
seen
the
enormous
losses
sustained
by
germany
in
coal
iron
and
potash
the
most
intelligent
and
able
working
classes
created
by
the
most
patient
efforts
have
been
reduced
to
the
state
of
becoming
revolutionary
elements
by
taking
away
from
germany
at
a
stroke
her
mercantile
marine
about
sailors
have
been
thrown
on
the
streets
and
their
skill
made
useless
germany
therefore
impoverished
in
her
agricultural
territory
deprived
of
a
good
part
of
her
raw
materials
with
a
population
weakened
in
its
productive
qualities
has
lost
a
good
part
of
her
productive
capacity
because
all
her
organization
abroad
has
been
broken
and
everything
which
served
as
a
means
of
exchange
of
products
such
as
her
mercantile
fleet
has
been
destroyed
moreover
germany
encounters
everywhere
obstacles
and
diffidence
impeded
from
developing
herself
on
the
seas
held
up
to
ridicule
by
the
absurd
corridor
of
danzig
whereby
there
is
a
polish
state
in
german
territory
she
can
not
help
seeking
life
and
raw
materials
in
russia
in
these
conditions
she
must
not
only
nourish
her
vast
population
not
only
produce
sufficient
to
prevent
her
from
falling
into
misery
but
must
also
pay
an
indemnity
which
fertile
fantasies
have
made
a
deceived
europe
believe
should
amount
even
to
milliards
of
gold
marks
and
which
even
now
is
supposed
by
seemingly
reasonable
people
to
be
able
to
surpass
easily
the
sum
of
a
hundred
milliards
could
france
or
italy
by
any
kind
of
sacrifice
have
paid
any
indemnities
after
ending
the
war
germany
has
not
only
to
live
and
make
reparation
but
to
maintain
an
army
of
occupation
and
the
heavy
machinery
of
the
reparations
commission
and
must
prepare
to
pay
an
indemnity
for
thirty
years
france
and
italy
have
preserved
their
colonies
italy
do
not
amount
to
much
their
mercantile
fleets
which
have
much
increased
their
foreign
organization
germany
without
any
of
these
things
is
to
find
herself
able
to
pay
an
indemnity
which
a
and
ignorant
press
deceived
the
public
into
believing
could
amount
to
twenty
or
milliards
a
year
taking

chance

at
ten
milliards
the
difference
between
an
annual
production
of
milliards
and
a
consumption
of
milliards
inexpert
persons
have
said
that
germany
can
pay
without
difficulty
ten
milliards
plus
a
premium
on
her
exports
plus
a
sufficient
quantity
of
goods
and
products
one
becomes
humiliated
when
one
sees
newspapers
of
serious
reputation
and
politicians
deemed
not
to
be
unimportant
reasoning
in
language
so
false
the
estimates
of
private
wealth
about
which
the
economists
make
experiments
and
on
which
i
myself
have
written
much
in
the
past
have
a
relative
value
it
may
be
argued
that
before
the
war
the
total
of
all
private
patrimony
in
germany
surpassed
but
by
little
three
hundred
milliards
of
marks
and
this
is
a
valuation
made
upon
generous
criteria
but
when
it
is
said
that
the
annual
capitalization
of
germany
was
ten
milliards
that
is
not
to
say
that
ten
milliards
of
capital
is
deposited
in
the
banks
ready
to
be
transferred
at
will
capitalization
means
the
creation
of
instruments
of
production
the
national
capital
increases
in
proportion
as
these
are
increased
therefore
the
best
way
of
examining
the
annual
capitalization
of
a
country
is
to
see
how
many
new
industries
have
arisen
to
what
extent
the
old
ones
have
been
improved
what
improvements
have
been
introduced
into
agriculture
what
new
investments
have
been
made
etc
if
the
capitalization
of
germany
before
the
war
was
scarcely
ten
milliards
of
marks
it
was
too
small
for
an
empire
of
some
persons
i
believe
that
in
reality
it
was
larger
but
even
if
it
came
to
fifteen
milliards
it
represented
a
very
small
figure
the
population
in
the
progressive
countries
augments
every
year
in
germany
before
the
war
in
the
period
the
population
increased
on
an
average
by
persons
a
year
the
difference
between
the
people
born
alive
and
the
dead
in
other
words
the
annual
increase
of
the
population
per
annum
was
at
the
rate
of
per
thousand
as
in
certain
districts
of
italy
the
peasants
plant
a
row
of
trees
on
the
birth
of
every
son
so
among
nations
it
is
necessary
to
increase
the
national
wealth
at
least
in
proportion
to
the
newly
arrived
supposing
that
the
private
wealth
of
the
german
citizens
was
from
to
milliards
of
marks
an
exaggeration
doubtless
it
would
mean
that
the
wealth
increased
each
year
by
a
thirteenth
part
or
rather
more
the
difference
between
the
increase
in
population
and
the
increase
in
wealth
constituted
the
effective
increase
in
wealth
but
always
in
a
form
not
capable
of
being
immediately
handled
to
plant
trees
build
workshops
utilize
all
this
stands
for
the
output
of
so
much
force
one
may
undertake
such
works
or
not
but
in
any
case
the
result
can
not
immediately
be
given
to
the
enemy
this
is
so
obvious
as
to
be
banal
to
seek
to
propagate
the
idea
that
germany
can
give
that
which
constitutes
her
annual
capitalization
either
wholly
or
in
great
part
is
an
example
of
extreme
ignorance
of
economic
facts
it
is
positively
painful
to
listen
to
certain
types
of
argument
a
french
minister
has
said
that
the
success
of
the
war
loans
for
milliards
in
germany
and
the
increase
of
bank
deposits
for
a
sum
of
milliards
coinciding
with
an
increase
of
capital
of
milliards
in
limited
companies
demonstrate
that
germany
has
saved
at
least
milliards
in
four
years
leaving
aside
the
exactness
of
these
figures
it
is
really
sad
to
observe
reasoning
of
this
type
how
can
the
public
have
an
idea
of
the
reality
let
us
apply
the
same
reasoning
to
france
we
must
say
that
inasmuch
as
france
before
the
war
had
a
public
debt
of
milliards
and
now
has
a
debt
of
milliards
without
calculating
what
she
owes
to
great
britain
and
the
united
states
france
by
reason
of
the
war
has
immensely
enriched
herself
since
leaving
aside
the
debt
contracted
abroad
and
the
previous
debt
she
has
saved
during
the
war
milliards
quite
apart
from
the
increase
in
bank
deposits
and
the
increase
in
capital
of
limited
companies
the
war
has
therefore
immensely
enriched
her
in
reality
we
are
face
to
face
with
one
of
the
phenomena
of
the
intoxication
brought
about
by
paper
money
by
means
of
which
it
has
been
possible
at
certain
times
for
the
public
to
believe
that
the
war
had
increased
wealth
other
features
of
this
phenomenon
we
have
in
the
wretched
example
of
the
capitalist
classes
after
which
it
was
not
unnatural
that
the
people
should
give
way
to
a
great
increase
in
consumption
should
demand
high
wages
and
offer
little
work
in
return
at
the
very
time
when
it
was
most
necessary
to
work
more
and
consume
less
there
is
small
cause
for
wonder
that
certain
erroneous
ideas
are
diffused
among
the
public
when
they
have
their
being
in
those
very
sophisms
according
to
which
the
indemnity
to
be
paid
by
the
beaten
enemy
will
pay
all
the
debts
and
losses
of
the
conquering
nations
we
are
told
that
germany
being
responsible
for
the
war
must
impose
on
herself
a
regime
of
restrictions
and
organize
herself
as
an
exporting
nation
for
the
payment
of
the
reparation
debts
here
again
the
question
can
be
considered
in
two
ways
according
as
it
is
proposed
to
allow
germany
a
free
commerce
or
to
impose
on
her
a
series
of
forced
cessions
of
goods
in
payment
of
the
reparations
both
hypotheses
can
be
entertained
but
both
as
we
shall
see
lead
to
economic
disorder
in
the
conquering
states
if
these
relations
are
to
be
regulated
by
violence
it
is
useless
to
dilate
on
the
other
aphorisms
or
rather
sophisms
which
were
seriously
discussed
at
the
paris
conference
and
which
had
even
the
honour
of
being
sustained
by
the
technical
experts
that
it
is
not
important
to
know
what
germany
can
pay
but
it
is
sufficient
to
know
what
she
ought
to
pay
that
no
one
can
foresee
what
immense
resources
germany
will
develop
within
thirty
or
forty
years
and
what
germany
will
not
be
able
to
pay
will
be
paid
by
the
allies
that
germany
under
the
stimulus
of
a
military
occupation
will
increase
her
production
in
an
manner
the
obligation
arising
from
the
treaty
is
an
absolute
one
the
capacity
to
pay
can
only
be
taken
into
consideration
to
establish
the
number
and
amount
of
the
annual
payments
the
total
must
in
any
case
be
paid
within
thirty
years
or
more
ou
germany
must
pay
if
she
does
the
allies
must
pay
it
is
not
necessary
that
germany
free
herself
by
a
certain
date
it
is
only
necessary
that
she
pay
all
germany
has
not
to
discuss
only
to
pay
let
time
illustrate
what
is
at
present
unforeseeable
etc
etc
if
we
exclude
the
third
means
of
payment
germany
has
two
ways
open
to
her
first
of
all
she
can
give
goods
what
goods
when
we
speak
of
goods
we
really
mean
coal
now
as
we
have
seen
according
to
the
treaty
germany
must
furnish
for
ten
years
to
belgium
italy
and
france
especially
quantities
of
coal
which
in
the
first
five
years
run
from
to
millions
of
tons
and
in
the
following
five
years
come
to
a
maximum
of
about
millions
and
all
this
when
she
has
lost
the
saar
coalfields
and
is
faced
with
the
threatening
situation
in
upper
silesia
germany
exports
reached
their
maximum
in
when
the
figures
touched
millions
of
marks
excluding
precious
metals
grouping
exports
and
imports
in
categories
the
millions
of
marks
were
distributed
as
follows
imports
exports
foodstuffs
live
animals
raw
materials
goods
manufactured
goods
about
of
the
entire
exports
was
in
iron
and
machine
products
mil
articles
in
iron
machines
millions
from
coal
as
against
imports
of
other
qualities
of
millions
of
chemical
products
and
drugs
from
cotton
paint
productions
etc
what
goods
can
germany
give
in
payment
of
the
indemnity
we
have
seen
how
she
has
lost
a
very
large
part
of
her
iron
and
a
considerable
quantity
of
her
coal
all
the
economic
force
of
germany
was
based
upon
a
the
proper
use
of
her
reserves
of
coal
and
iron
which
allowed
her
to
develop
enormously
those
industries
which
are
based
on
these
two
elements
b
on
her
transport
and
tariff
system
which
enabled
her
to
fight
any
competition
c
on
her
potent
overseas
commercial
organization
now
by
effect
of
the
treaty
these
three
great
forces
have
been
entirely
or
in
part
destroyed
what
goods
can
germany
give
in
payment
of
the
indemnity
and
what
goods
can
she
offer
without
ruining
the
internal
production
of
the
entente
countries
let
us
suppose
that
germany
gives
machines
colours
wagons
locomotives
etc
then
for
this
very
fact
the
countries
of
the
entente
already
suffering
by
unemployment
would
soon
see
their
factories
obliged
to
shut
down
germany
must
therefore
above
all
give
raw
materials
but
since
she
is
herself
a
country
that
imports
raw
materials
and
has
an
enormous
and
dense
population
she
is
herself
obliged
to
import
raw
materials
for
the
fundamental
needs
of
her
existence
if
we
examine
germany
commerce
in
the
five
years
prior
to
the
war
that
is
in
the
five
years
of
her
greatest
boom
we
shall
find
that
the
imports
always
exceeded
the
exports
in
the
two
years
before
the
war
and
the
imports
were
respectively
and
millions
and
the
exports
and
millions
in
some
years
the
difference
even
exceeded
two
milliards
and
was
compensated
by
credits
abroad
with
the
payment
of
freights
and
with
the
remittances
always
considerable
of
the
german
emigrants
all
this
is
lost
exported
goods
can
yield
to
the
exporter
a
profit
of
let
us
suppose
ten
twelve
or
twenty
per
cent
for
the
allies
to
take
an
income
from
the
custom
returns
means
in
practice
reducing
the
exports
in
fact
in
germany
production
must
be
carried
on
at
such
low
prices
as
to
compensate
for
the
difference
or
the
exports
must
be
reduced
in
the
first
case
which
is
not
likely
since
germany
succeeds
only
with
difficulty
owing
to
her
exchange
in
obtaining
raw
materials
and
must
encounter
worse
difficulties
in
this
respect
than
other
countries
germany
would
be
preparing
the
ruin
of
the
other
countries
in
organizing
forms
of
production
which
are
superior
to
those
of
all
her
rivals
germany
would
therefore
damage
all
her
creditors
especially
in
the
foreign
markets
in
the
second
case
the
reduction
of
exports
one
would
have
the
exactly
opposite
effect
to
that
imagined
in
the
programme
proposed
that
is
the
indemnities
would
become
unpayable
in
terms
of
francs
or
lire
at
par
with
the
dollar
exportations
in
have
amounted
to
millions
in
an
increase
may
be
foreseen
if
germany
has
to
pay
in
cash
and
kind
millions
of
marks
at
par
plus
per
cent
of
the
total
of
her
exports
then
supposing
an
export
trade
of
eight
milliards
she
will
have
to
give
millions
or
in
all
millions
of
marks
thus
we
arrive
by
stages
at
less
hyperbolical
figures
coming
down
from
the
milliards
a
year
to
something
less
than
a
fifth
but
to
come
to
grips
with
reality
germany
in
all
ways
it
must
be
admitted
can
not
give
more
than
two
milliards
a
year
if
indeed
it
is
desired
that
an
indemnity
be
paid
notwithstanding
her
great
resources
france
would
not
be
in
a
condition
to
pay
abroad
two
milliards
a
year
without
ruining
her
exchange
which
would
drop
at
once
to
the
level
of
germany
italy
with
difficulty
could
pay
one
milliard
france
and
italy
are
honest
countries
yet
they
can
not
pay
their
war
creditors
and
have
not
been
able
and
are
not
able
to
pay
any
share
of
their
debt
either
to
the
united
states
of
america
or
to
great
britain
as
a
matter
of
fact
up
till
now
they
have
paid
nothing
and
the
interest
continues
to
accumulate
with
the
capital
why
have
neither
france
nor
italy
yet
started
to
pay
some
of
their
debt
having
won
the
war
france
has
had
all
she
could
have
fertile
territories
new
colonies
an
abundance
of
raw
material
and
above
all
iron
and
potash
the
simple
explanation
is
that
which
i
have
given
above
can
then
germany
who
is
in
a
terrible
condition
whose
circulation
promises
ruin
who
has
no
longer
credits
nor
organization
abroad
who
has
a
great
shortage
in
raw
materials
can
germany
pay
four
or
five
milliards
a
year
we
must
also
remember
that
germany
in
addition
to
the
indemnity
must
pay
the
cost
of
the
army
of
occupation
which
up
to
now
has
amounted
to
milliards
of
paper
marks
a
year
or
more
than
millions
of
francs
at
par
that
is
germany
has
to
bear
for
the
support
of
the
allied
troops
a
charge
equal
to
the
cost
of
maintaining
the
armies
of
france
italy
and
belgium
before
the
war
no
financier
seriously
believes
that
the
issue
of
bonds
authorized
by
the
treaty
for
the
credit
of
the
reparations
commission
has
now
any
probability
of
success
germany
monetary
circulation
system
is
falling
to
the
stage
of
and
the
time
is
not
distant
when
if
intelligent
provision
is
not
made
germany
will
not
be
in
a
position
to
pay
any
indemnity
obliged
to
pay
only
one
milliard
of
gold
marks
germany
has
not
been
able
to
find
this
modest
sum
modest
that
is
in
comparison
with
all
the
dreams
about
the
indemnity
without
contracting
new
foreign
debts
and
increasing
her
already
enormous
paper
circulation
each
new
indemnity
payment
each
new
debt
incurred
will
only
place
germany
in
the
position
of
being
unable
to
make
payments
abroad
many
capitalists
even
in
italy
inspire
their
press
to
state
that
germany
derives
an
advantage
from
the
depreciation
of
her
mark
or
in
other
words
is
content
with
its
low
level
but
the
high
exchanges
and
in
the
case
of
germany
it
amounts
to
ruin
render
almost
impossible
the
purchase
of
raw
materials
of
which
germany
has
need
with
what
means
must
she
carry
out
her
payments
if
she
is
obliged
to
cede
a
large
part
of
her
customs
receipts
that
is
of
her
best
form
of
monetary
value
and
if
she
has
no
longer
either
credits
or
freights
abroad
if
what
is
happening
injured
germany
only
it
would
be
more
possible
to
explain
it
if
not
to
justify
it
but
on
the
contrary
fall
which
is
also
the
decadence
of
europe
profoundly
disturbs
not
only
the
european
continent
but
many
other
producing
countries
though
the
united
states
and
great
britain
partially
escape
the
effect
they
too
feel
the
influence
of
it
not
only
in
their
political
serenity
but
in
the
market
of
goods
and
values
germany
position
is
bound
up
with
that
of
europe
her
conquerors
can
not
escape
dire
consequences
if
the
erstwhile
enemy
collapses
we
must
not
forget
that
before
the
war
in
the
years
and
the
larger
part
of
germany
commerce
was
with
the
united
states
with
great
britain
with
russia
and
with
in
her
commerce
with
the
united
states
represented
alone
little
less
than
two
milliards
and
a
half
of
marks
according
to
the
statistics
of
the
german
empire
and
millions
of
dollars
according
to
the
figures
of
america
if
we
except
canada
which
we
may
consider
a
territorial
continuation
the
two
best
customers
of
the
united
states
were
great
britain
and
germany
they
were
moreover
the
two
customers
whose
imports
largely
exceeded
the
exports
the
downfall
of
germany
will
bring
about
inevitably
a
formidable
crisis
in
the
countries
and
consequent
ruin
in
other
countries
up
to
now
germany
has
given
all
she
could
any
further
payment
will
cause
a
downfall
without
changing
the
actual
monetary
position
germany
after
a
certain
point
will
not
pay
but
will
drag
down
in
her
fall
the
economic
edifices
of
the
victorious
countries
of
the
continent
all
attempts
at
force
are
useless
all
impositions
are
sterile
all
this
is
true
and
can
not
be
denied
but
at
the
same
time
it
must
be
recognized
that
in
the
first
move
for
the
indemnity
there
was
a
reasonable
cause
for
anxiety
on
the
part
of
the
allies
if
germany
had
had
to
pay
no
indemnity
this
absurd
situation
would
have
come
about
that
although
exhausted
germany
would
have
issued
from
the
war
without
debts
abroad
and
could
easily
have
got
into
her
stride
again
while
france
italy
and
in
much
less
degree
great
britain
would
have
come
out
of
the
war
with
heavy
debts
this
anxiety
was
not
only
just
and
well
founded
but
it
is
easy
to
see
why
it
gave
ground
for
a
feeling
of
grave
disquiet
france
and
italy
the
two
big
victor
states
of
the
continent
were
only
able
to
carry
on
the
war
through
the
assistance
of
great
britain
and
the
united
states
the
war
would
not
have
lasted
long
without
the
aid
of
the
which
had
a
decisive
effect
france
has
obtained
all
she
asked
for
and
indeed
more
than
all
her
previsions
warranted
italy
has
found
herself
in
a
difficult
position
she
too
has
realized
her
territorial
aspirations
though
not
completely
and
the
assistance
of
her
allies
has
not
always
been
cordial
i
have
had
as
head
of
the
government
to
oppose
all
the
agitations
and
especially
the
adriatic
adventures
which
have
caused
an
acute
party
division
in
italy
from
a
sense
of
duty
i
have
also
assumed
all
responsibility
but
the
rigidness
of
wilson
in
the
fiume
and
adriatic
questions
and
the
behaviour
of
some
of
the
european
allies
have
been
perfectly
unjustifiable
in
certain
messages
to
wilson
during
my
term
of
government
i
did
not
fail
to
bring
this
fact
forward
certainly
demands
must
be
considered
with
a
sense
of
justice
and
it
would
have
been
an
error
and
an
injustice
to
attribute
to
italy
large
tracts
of
territory
in
dalmatia
but
it
would
have
been
possible
to
find
a
more
reasonable
settlement
for
a
country
which
has
had
such
sufferings
and
known
such
losses
during
the
war
in
any
case
when
by
the
absurd
system
followed
in
the
treaties
so
many
millions
of
germans
magyars
turks
and
bulgarians
have
been
handed
over
to
states
like
serbia
whose
intemperate
behaviour
precipitated
the
war
or
to
states
like
greece
which
took
only
a
small
and
obligatory
part
in
it
when
states
like
poland
have
won
their
unity
and
independence
without
making
war
when
germany
has
been
dismembered
in
order
to
give
poland
an
access
to
the
sea
and
the
ridiculous
situation
of
danzig
has
been
created
when
the
moral
paradox
of
the
saar
which
now
becomes
a
german
has
been
set
up
when
so
many
millions
of
men
have
been
parcelled
out
without
any
criteria
it
was
particularly
invidious
to
contest
so
bitterly
italy
claims
i
can
freely
affirm
this
inasmuch
as
risking
all
popularity
i
have
always
done
my
duty
as
a
statesman
pointing
out
that
solution
which
time
has
proved
to
be
inevitable
no
one
can
deny
that
italy
is
passing
through
a
period
of
crisis
and
political
such
states
of
public
psychology
are
for
peoples
what
neurasthenia
is
for
individuals
on
what
does
it
depend
often
enough
on
reasons
which
can
not
be
isolated
or
defined
it
is
a
state
of
mind
which
may
come
to
an
end
at
any
minute
and
is
consequent
upon
the
of
the
war
rather
than
coming
from
the
economic
disorder
it
derives
from
a
malady
of
the
temperament
i
have
never
believed
in
spite
of
the
agitations
which
have
been
seen
at
certain
periods
in
the
possibility
of
a
revolutionary
movement
in
italy
italy
is
the
only
country
which
has
never
had
religious
wars
the
only
country
which
in
twenty
centuries
has
never
had
a
real
revolution
land
of
an
ancient
civilization
prone
to
sudden
bursts
of
enthusiasm
susceptible
to
rapid
moods
of
discouragement
italy
with
all
the
infinite
resources
of
the
latin
spirit
has
always
overcome
the
most
difficult
crises
by
her
wonderful
adaptive
power
in
human
history
she
is
perhaps
the
only
country
where
three
great
civilizations
have
risen
up
one
after
another
in
her
limited
soil
if
italy
can
have
the
minimum
of
coal
cereals
and
raw
materials
necessary
to
her
existence
and
her
economic
revival
the
traditional
good
sense
of
the
italian
people
will
easily
overcome
a
crisis
which
is
grave
but
which
affects
in
various
measure
all
the
victors
and
is
especially
temperamental
it
can
not
be
denied
that
if
all
europe
is
sick
italy
has
its
own
special
state
of
mind
those
who
wished
the
war
and
those
who
were
against
it
are
both
dissatisfied
the
former
because
after
the
war
italy
has
not
had
the
compensations
she
expected
and
has
had
sufferings
far
greater
than
could
have
been
imagined
the
latter
because
they
attribute
to
the
war
and
the
conduct
of
the
war
the
great
trials
which
the
nation
has
now
to
face
this
sickness
of
the
spirit
is
the
greatest
cause
of
disorder
since
malcontent
is
always
the
worst
kind
of
leaven
four
great
countries
decided
the
war
great
britain
france
italy
and
the
united
states
of
america
russia
fell
to
pieces
soon
and
fell
rather
on
account
of
her
own
internal
conditions
than
from
enemy
pressure
the
action
of
the
united
states
arrived
late
but
was
decisive
each
country
however
acted
from
a
different
state
of
mind
france
had
of
necessity
to
make
war
her
territory
was
invaded
and
all
hope
of
salvation
lay
in
moral
resistance
alone
great
britain
had
to
wage
the
war
out
of
sense
of
duty
she
had
guaranteed
the
neutrality
of
belgium
and
could
not
fail
to
keep
her
word
of
honour
two
countries
alone
chose
freely
the
sorrowful
way
of
the
war
italy
and
the
united
states
but
their
sacrifices
sufferings
and
losses
have
been
very
different
during
the
war
the
united
states
have
been
able
to
develop
their
immense
resources
and
notwithstanding
some
crises
they
have
come
out
of
it
much
richer
than
before
from
being
debtors
to
europe
they
have
become
creditors
they
had
few
losses
in
men
and
a
great
development
in
wealth
italy
who
after
many
difficulties
had
developed
in
her
famous
but
too
narrow
territory
the
germs
of
a
greater
fortune
has
had
together
with
very
heavy
losses
in
men
heavy
losses
in
her
wealth
italy
saved
the
destinies
of
france
for
the
first
time
by
declaring
her
neutrality
on
august
and
letting
the
certainty
of
it
be
known
from
july
as
the
diplomatic
documents
have
shown
it
was
that
sudden
and
unexpected
declaration
of
neutrality
which
rendered
it
possible
for
france
to
concentrate
all
her
forces
in
the
north
and
to
win
the
battle
of
the
marne
italy
for
a
second
time
saved
the
destinies
of
the
entente
by
entering
into
the
war
too
precipitately
and
unprepared
in
may
thus
preventing
the
austrian
army
which
was
formidable
for
its
technical
organization
and
for
its
valour
from
obtaining
the
advantages
it
expected
why
did
italy
go
to
war
the
diplomatic
documents
which
are
not
all
documents
of
political
wisdom
demonstrate
the
anxiety
of
the
italian
government
to
realize
its
adriatic
programme
and
to
gain
secure
frontiers
against
and
its
successors
but
this
was
not
the
of
the
war
it
was
rather
a
means
of
explaining
to
the
people
the
necessity
for
the
war
italy
had
been
for
nearly
years
ally
of
and
the
aspirations
of
italy
adriatic
policy
had
never
disturbed
the
relations
between
the
two
countries
the
real
cause
of
italy
war
was
a
sentimental
movement
a
form
of
extraordinary
agitation
of
the
spirits
brought
about
by
the
invasion
of
belgium
and
the
danger
of
france
the
intellectual
movement
especially
the
world
of
culture
partook
largely
in
fomenting
the
state
of
exaltation
which
determined
the
war
during
the
progress
of
the
war
which
was
long
and
bitter
italy
passed
through
some
terrible
hours
her
privations
during
the
war
and
immediately
after
surpassed
all
expectations
italy
found
herself
face
to
face
with
an
enemy
who
enjoyed
a
superior
geographical
situation
a
numerical
superiority
as
well
as
a
superiority
in
artillery
after
the
downfall
of
russia
she
had
to
support
a
terrible
campaign
even
in
after
the
military
disaster
when
allied
troops
came
to
italy
she
sent
abroad
more
men
than
there
came
allied
troops
to
her
aid
according
to
some
statistics
which
i
had
compiled
and
which
i
communicated
to
the
allies
italy
was
shown
in
relation
to
her
demographic
structure
to
have
more
men
in
the
front
line
than
any
other
country
the
economic
sufferings
were
and
are
greater
than
those
endured
by
others
france
is
only
in
part
a
mediterranean
country
while
italy
is
entirely
so
during
the
war
the
action
of
the
submarines
rendered
the
victualling
of
italy
a
very
difficult
matter
many
provinces
for
months
on
end
had
to
content
themselves
with
the
most
wretched
kind
of
food
taking
population
and
wealth
into
proportion
if
the
united
states
had
made
the
effort
of
italy
they
would
have
had
to
arm
sixteen
millions
of
men
to
have
lost
a
million
and
a
half
to
two
million
soldiers
and
to
have
spent
at
least
four
hundred
milliards
in
order
to
work
up
popular
enthusiasm
and
it
was
perhaps
necessary
the
importance
of
the
country
adriatic
claims
was
exaggerated
thus
many
italians
believe
even
in
good
faith
that
the
war
may
be
considered
as
lost
if
some
of
these
aspirations
have
not
been
realized
or
will
not
be
realized
but
after
the
war
italy
situation
suddenly
changed
the
war
had
aroused
in
the
minds
of
all
europeans
a
certain
sentiment
of
violence
a
longing
for
expansion
and
conquest
the
proclamations
of
the
entente
the
declarations
of
wilson
principles
or
points
became
so
contorted
that
no
trace
of
them
could
be
found
in
the
treaties
save
for
that
ironic
of
the
league
of
nations
which
is
always
repeated
on
the
front
page
as
dante
said
of
the
rule
of
benedict
the
expense
of
the
for
italy
a
very
curious
situation
came
about
france
had
but
one
enemy
germany
she
united
all
her
forces
against
this
enemy
in
a
coherent
and
single
action
which
culminated
in
the
treaty
of
versailles
france
had
but
one
idea
to
make
the
entente
abandon
the
principles
it
had
proclaimed
and
try
to
suffocate
germany
dismember
her
humiliate
her
by
means
of
a
military
occupation
by
controlling
her
transports
confiscating
all
her
available
wealth
by
raising
to
the
dignity
of
elevated
and
highly
civilized
states
inferior
populations
without
national
dignity
was
composed
of
eleven
peoples
it
was
split
up
into
a
series
of
states
austria
and
hungary
were
reduced
to
small
territories
and
shut
up
in
narrow
confines
all
the
other
countries
were
given
to
rumania
to
serbia
or
more
exactly
to
the
state
to
poland
or
else
were
formed
into
new
states
such
as
these
countries
were
considered
by
the
entente
as
allies
and
to
further
good
relations
the
most
important
of
the
entente
nations
protected
their
aspirations
even
against
the
wishes
of
italy
the
italians
had
found
themselves
in
their
difficult
theatre
of
war
against
galatians
bosnians
croats
transylvanians
etc
but
by
the
simple
fact
of
their
having
changed
names
and
having
called
themselves
poles
rumanians
they
became
friends
in
order
to
favour
some
of
these
new
friends
it
has
happened
that
not
only
have
italy
sentiments
been
offended
but
even
justice
itself
montenegro
was
always
mentioned
in
the
declarations
of
the
entente
on
january
briand
speaking
in
the
name
of
all
the
allies
united
at
that
time
la
d√©fense
et
la
libert√©
des
put
forward
as
a
fundamental
programme
the
restoration
of
belgium
serbia
and
montenegro
montenegro
was
in
this
on
an
equality
with
belgium
just
a
year
afterwards
january
wilson
when
formulating
his
fourteen
points
had
included
in
the
eleventh
proposition
the
duty
of
evacuating
the
territories
of
rumania
serbia
and
montenegro
and
restoring
them
the
exact
reason
for
which
it
was
established
that
montenegro
should
be
absorbed
even
without
plebiscite
by
the
state
thus
offending
also
italy
sentiments
will
remain
one
of
the
most
melancholy
pages
of
the
new
holy
alliance
that
the
entente
has
become
along
with
that
poor
prestigeless
organism
the
league
of
nations
but
let
us
hope
this
latter
will
find
a
means
of
renovating
itself
while
france
was
ruining
the
german
people
sources
of
life
the
peoples
who
had
fought
most
ferociously
against
italy
became
through
the
war
friendly
nations
and
every
aspiration
of
italy
appeared
directed
to
lessen
the
prestige
of
the
new
friends
and
allies
the
territories
annexed
to
italy
have
a
small
economic
value
for
more
than
thirty
years
italy
had
sold
a
large
part
of
her
richest
agricultural
produce
to
germany
and
had
imported
a
considerable
share
of
her
raw
materials
from
russia
since
the
war
she
has
found
herself
in
a
state
of
regular
isolation
a
large
part
of
the
italian
press
which
repeats
at
haphazard
the
commonest
themes
of
the
french
press
instead
of
wishing
for
a
more
intense
revival
of
commercial
relations
with
germany
frightens
the
ignorant
public
with
stories
of
german
penetration
and
the
very
plutocracy
in
france
and
italy
though
not
to
the
same
extent
in
italy
abandons
itself
to
the
identical
error
so
we
find
spread
throughout
the
peninsula
a
sense
of
lively
discontent
which
is
conducive
to
a
wider
acceptance
of
the
exaggerations
of
the
socialists
and
the
fascists
but
the
phenomenon
is
a
transitory
one
italy
had
no
feeling
of
rancour
against
the
german
people
she
entered
the
war
against
german
imperialism
and
can
not
now
follow
any
imperialistic
policy
indeed
in
the
face
of
the
imperialistic
competitions
which
have
followed
the
war
italy
finds
herself
in
a
state
of
profound
psychological
uneasiness
france
worries
herself
about
one
people
only
since
as
a
matter
of
fact
she
has
only
one
warlike
race
at
her
frontiers
germany
frontiers
touch
france
the
german
peoples
the
slav
races
it
is
therefore
her
interest
to
approve
a
democratic
policy
which
allows
no
one
of
the
group
of
combatants
to
take
up
a
position
of
superiority
the
true
italian
nationalist
policy
consists
in
being
against
all
excessive
nationalisms
and
nothing
is
more
harmful
to
italy
policy
than
the
abandonment
of
those
democratic
principles
in
the
name
of
which
she
arose
and
by
which
she
lives
if
the
policy
of
justice
is
a
moral
duty
for
the
other
nations
for
italy
it
is
a
necessity
of
existence
the
italian
people
has
a
clear
vision
of
these
facts
notwithstanding
a
certain
section
of
her
press
and
notwithstanding
the
exaggerations
of
certain
excited
parties
arisen
from
the
ashes
of
the
war
and
therefore
her
uneasiness
is
great
while
other
countries
have
an
economic
crisis
italy
experiences
in
addition
a
mental
crisis
but
one
with
which
she
will
be
able
to
cope
france
however
is
in
a
much
more
difficult
situation
and
her
policy
is
still
a
result
of
her
anxieties
all
the
violences
against
germany
were
until
the
day
before
yesterday
an
effect
of
hatred
they
derive
from
dread
moral
ideas
have
for
nations
a
still
greater
value
than
wealth
france
had
until
the
other
day
the
prestige
of
her
democratic
institutions
all
of
us
who
detested
the
hohenzollern
dynasty
and
the
insolent
fatuity
of
william
ii
loved
france
heir
of
the
bourgeois
revolution
and
champion
of
democracy
so
when
the
war
came
all
the
democracies
felt
a
lively
pang
the
crushing
of
france
meant
the
crushing
of
democracy
and
liberty
all
the
old
bonds
are
broken
all
the
organization
which
germany
had
abroad
is
smashed
up
and
france
has
been
saved
not
by
arms
alone
but
by
the
potent
life
of
free
peoples
yet
victory
has
taken
away
from
france
her
greatest
prestige
her
fascination
as
a
democratic
country
now
all
the
democratic
races
of
the
world
look
at
france
with
an
eye
of
diffidence
some
indeed
with
rancour
others
with
hate
france
has
comported
herself
much
more
crudely
toward
germany
than
a
victorious
germany
would
have
comported
herself
toward
france
in
the
case
of
russia
she
has
followed
purely
plutocratic
tendencies
she
has
on
foot
the
largest
army
in
the
world
in
front
of
a
helpless
germany
she
sends
coloured
troops
to
occupy
the
most
cultured
and
progressive
cities
of
germany
abusing
the
fruits
of
victory
she
shows
no
respect
for
the
principle
of
nationality
or
for
the
right
of
germany
is
in
a
helpless
and
broken
condition
she
will
not
make
war
she
can
not
but
if
she
should
make
war
how
many
peoples
would
come
to
france
aid
the
policy
which
has
set
the
people
of
italy
against
one
another
the
diffusion
of
nationalist
violence
the
crude
persecutions
of
enemies
excluded
even
from
the
league
of
nations
have
created
an
atmosphere
of
distrust
of
france
admirable
in
her
political
perceptiveness
france
by
reason
of
an
error
of
exaltation
has
lost
almost
all
the
benefit
of
her
victorious
action
a
situation
hedged
with
difficulties
has
been
brought
about
the
united
states
and
great
britain
have
no
longer
any
treaty
of
alliance
of
guarantee
with
france
the
conquerors
of
the
war
and
the
peace
have
drawn
themselves
aside
italy
has
no
alliance
and
can
not
have
any
no
italian
politician
could
pledge
his
country
and
parliament
only
desires
that
italy
follow
a
democratic
peaceful
policy
maintaining
herself
in
europe
as
a
force
for
equilibrium
and
life
france
apart
from
her
military
alliance
with
belgium
has
a
whole
system
of
alliances
based
largely
on
the
newly
formed
states
shifting
sands
like
poland
russia
and
germany
enemy
whose
fate
no
one
can
prophesy
when
germany
is
reconstructed
and
russia
risen
again
unless
she
finds
a
way
of
remedying
her
present
mistakes
which
are
much
more
numerous
than
her
past
misfortunes
thus
the
more
france
increases
her
army
the
more
she
corners
raw
materials
and
increases
her
measures
against
germany
the
more
unquiet
she
becomes
she
has
seen
that
germany
mistress
on
land
and
to
a
large
extent
on
the
seas
after
having
carried
everywhere
her
victorious
flag
after
having
organized
her
commerce
and
by
means
of
her
bankers
merchants
and
capitalists
made
vast
expansions
and
placed
a
regular
network
of
relations
and
intrigue
round
the
earth
fell
when
she
attempted
her
act
of
imperialistic
violence
france
when
in
difficulties
appealed
to
the
sentiment
of
the
nations
and
found
arms
everywhere
to
help
her
what
then
is
able
organization
worth
the
fluctuations
of
fortune
in
europe
show
for
all
her
peoples
a
succession
of
victories
and
defeats
there
are
no
peoples
always
victorious
after
having
under
napoleon
i
humiliated
germany
france
saw
the
end
of
her
imperialistic
dream
and
later
witnessed
the
ruin
of
napoleon
iii
she
has
suffered
two
great
defeats
and
then
when
she
stood
diminished
in
stature
before
a
germany
at
the
top
of
her
fortune
she
together
with
the
allies
has
had
a
victory
over
an
enemy
who
seemed
invincible
but
no
one
can
foresee
the
future
to
have
conveyed
great
nuclei
of
german
populations
to
the
slav
states
and
especially
to
poland
to
have
divided
the
magyars
without
any
consideration
for
their
fine
race
among
the
rumanians
and
the
to
have
used
every
kind
of
violence
with
the
bulgars
to
have
offended
turkey
on
any
and
every
pretext
to
have
done
this
is
not
to
have
guaranteed
the
victory
and
the
peace
russia
sooner
or
later
will
recover
it
is
an
illusion
to
suppose
that
great
britain
france
and
italy
can
form
an
agreement
to
regulate
the
new
state
or
new
states
that
will
arise
in
russia
there
are
too
many
tendencies
and
diverse
interests
germany
too
will
reconstruct
herself
after
a
series
of
sorrows
and
privations
and
no
one
can
say
how
the
germans
will
behave
unless
a
policy
of
peace
and
social
renovation
be
shaped
and
followed
our
sons
will
witness
scenes
much
more
terrible
than
those
which
have
horrified
our
generation
and
upset
our
minds
even
more
than
our
interests
meanwhile
in
spite
of
the
frightful
increase
of
scrofula
rickets
and
tuberculosis
from
which
the
conquered
peoples
are
principally
suffering
the
march
of
the
nations
will
proceed
according
to
the
laws
which
have
hitherto
ruled
them
and
on
which
our
limited
action
can
only
for
brief
periods
cause
small
modifications
or
alterations
demographic
forecasts
like
all
forecasts
of
social
events
have
but
a
comparative
value
it
is
true
that
demographic
movements
are
especially
biological
manifestations
but
it
is
also
true
that
economic
and
social
factors
exercise
a
profound
influence
in
limiting
their
regularity
and
can
disturb
them
very
considerably
it
is
better
therefore
not
to
make
long
prophecies
what
is
certain
is
that
the
french
population
has
increased
almost
imperceptibly
while
the
population
of
germany
augmented
very
rapidly
the
annual
average
of
births
in
the
five
years
before
the
war
was
in
france
and
in
belgium
in
germany
it
was
the
average
of
deaths
was
in
france
in
belgium
and
in
germany
thus
per
thousand
the
excess
of
births
in
france
was
in
belgium
in
germany
the
war
has
terribly
aggravated
the
situation
in
france
whose
demographic
structure
is
far
from
being
a
healthy
one
from
statistics
published
giving
the
first
results
of
the
french
census
of
without
the
new
territory
of
france
in
the
interval
between
the
two
census
periods
has
decreased
by
from
to
the
deaths
in
the
war
do
not
represent
a
half
of
this
decrease
when
is
deducted
the
losses
among
the
coloured
troops
and
those
from
french
colonies
who
fought
for
france
the
new
territories
annexed
to
france
do
not
compensate
for
the
and
the
decrease
in
births
we
may
presume
that
if
normal
conditions
of
life
return
the
population
of
germany
and
will
be
more
than
one
hundred
millions
that
the
population
of
belgium
altogether
little
less
than
fifty
millions
that
italy
will
have
a
population
much
greater
than
that
of
france
of
at
least
million
inhabitants
and
that
great
britain
will
have
about
sixty
million
inhabitants
in
the
case
of
the
germans
we
have
mentioned
one
hundred
million
persons
taking
into
consideration
germany
and
but
the
germans
of
poland
of
and
the
baltic
states
will
amount
to
at
least
twenty
millions
of
inhabitants
no
one
can
make
forecasts
even
of
an
approximate
nature
on
russia
whose
fecundity
is
always
the
highest
in
europe
and
whose
losses
are
rapidly
replaced
by
a
high
even
after
the
greatest
catastrophes
and
then
there
are
the
germans
spread
about
the
world
great
aggregations
of
populations
as
in
the
united
states
of
america
and
in
a
lesser
degree
in
brazil
up
to
now
these
people
have
been
silent
not
only
because
they
were
surrounded
by
hostile
populations
but
because
the
accusation
of
being
sons
of
the
huns
weighed
down
upon
them
more
than
any
danger
of
the
war
but
the
treaty
of
versailles
and
more
still
the
manner
in
which
it
has
been
applied
is
to
dissipate
and
soon
will
entirely
dissipate
the
atmosphere
of
antipathy
that
existed
against
the
germans
in
great
britain
the
situation
has
changed
profoundly
in
three
years
the
united
states
have
made
their
separate
peace
and
want
no
responsibility
in
italy
there
scarcely
exists
any
hatred
for
the
germans
and
apart
from
certain
capitalists
who
paint
in
lurid
colours
the
danger
of
german
penetration
in
their
papers
because
they
want
higher
tariff
protection
and
to
be
able
to
speculate
on
government
orders
there
is
no
one
who
does
not
desire
peace
with
all
peoples
the
great
majority
of
the
italian
people
only
desire
to
reconstruct
the
economic
and
social
life
of
the
nation
certain
tendencies
in
france
policy
depend
perhaps
on
her
great
anxiety
for
the
future
an
anxiety
in
fact
not
unjustified
by
the
lessons
of
the
past
germany
notwithstanding
her
fallen
state
her
anguish
and
the
torment
she
has
to
go
through
is
so
strong
and
vital
that
everybody
is
certain
of
seeing
her
once
again
potent
indeed
more
potent
and
formidable
than
ever
everyone
in
france
is
convinced
that
the
treaty
of
versailles
has
lost
all
foundation
since
the
united
states
of
america
abandoned
it
and
since
great
britain
and
italy
persuaded
of
the
impossibility
of
putting
certain
clauses
into
effect
have
shown
by
their
attitude
that
they
are
not
disposed
to
entertain
coercive
measures
which
are
as
useless
as
they
are
damaging
in
france
the
very
authors
of
the
treaty
of
versailles
recognize
that
it
is
weakened
by
a
series
of
successive
attenuations
tardieu

yet
in

of

of
france
and
other
countries
of

entente
there
is
not
only
the
rancour
and
anxiety
for
the
future
but
a
sentiment
of
diffidence
after
the
war
the
european
states
belonging
to
the
entente
have
been
embarrassed
not
only
on
account
of
the
enormous
internal
debts
but
also
for
the
huge
debts
contracted
abroad
if
germany
had
not
had
to
pay
any
indemnity
and
had
not
lost
her
colonies
and
mercantile
marine
we
should
have
been
confronted
with
the
absurd
paradox
that
the
victorious
nations
would
have
issued
from
the
war
worn
out
with
their
territories
destroyed
and
with
a
huge
foreign
debt
germany
would
have
had
her
territory
quite
intact
her
industries
ready
to
begin
work
again
herself
anxious
to
start
again
her
productive
force
and
in
addition
with
no
foreign
debt
consequently
ample
credit
abroad
in
the
mad
struggle
to
break
up
germany
there
has
had
part
not
only
hatred
but
also
a
quite
reasonable
anxiety
which
after
all
must
be
taken
into
consideration
even
three
years
after
the
war
great
britain
has
not
paid
her
debt
to
america
and
france
and
italy
have
not
paid
their
debts
to
america
and
great
britain
great
britain
could
pay
with
a
great
effort
france
and
italy
can
not
pay
anyhow
according
to
the
accounts
of
the
american
treasury
the
allies
war
debt
is
millions
of
dollars
millions
owing
from
great
britain
millions
from
france
millions
from
italy
millions
from
belgium
millions
from
russia
millions
from
millions
from
serbia
millions
from
rumania
and
millions
from
greece
up
to
last
july
great
britain
had
paid
back
millions
of
dollars
since
the
spring
of
the
payment
of
the
interest
on
the
amounts
due
to
the
american
treasury
has
been
suspended
by
some
european
states
between
october
and
november
the
amount
of
the
capitalizing
and
unpaid
interests
of
the
european
states
came
to
million
dollars
the
figure
has
considerably
increased
since
then
according
to
the
august
the
allies
debt
to
the
united
states
on
march
amounted
to
ten
milliards
and
million
dollars
including
the
interests
in
which
sum
great
britain
was
interested
to
the
sum
of
million
dollars
and
france
for
million
dollars
but
the
figures
in
variance
to
the
official
figures
include
other
debts
than
strictly
war
debts
the
debts
of
the
various
allied
countries
to
great
britain
on
march
according
to
a
schedule
annexed
to
the
financial
statement
for
published
by
the
british
treasury
came
to
distributed
as
follows
france
millions
italy
millions
russia
millions
belgium
millions
serbia
millions
portugal
rumania
greece
and
other
allies
millions
this
sum
represents
war
debts
but
to
it
must
be
added
the
given
by
great
britain
for
the
reconstruction
of
belgium
and
the
loans
granted
by
her
for
relief
to
an
amount
of
so
altogether
great
britain
credit
to
the
allies
on
march
was
and
has
since
been
increased
by
the
interests
great
britain
had
also
at
the
same
date
a
credit
of
to
her
dominions
france
has
credit
of
little
less
than
nine
milliard
francs
of
which
millions
is
from
italy
four
milliards
from
russia
millions
from
belgium
millions
from
the
and
millions
from
other
allies
italy
has
only
small
credits
of
no
account
now
this
situation
by
reason
of
which
the
victorious
countries
of
europe
are
heavy
debtors
france
has
a
foreign
debt
of
nearly
milliards
and
italy
a
debt
of
more
than
milliards
in
comparison
with
germany
which
came
out
of
the
war
without
any
debt
has
created
a
certain
amount
of
bad
feeling
germany
would
have
got
on
her
feet
again
quicker
than
the
victors
if
she
had
no
indemnity
to
pay
and
had
no
foreign
debts
to
settle
france
anxieties
in
this
matter
are
perfectly
legitimate
and
must
be
most
seriously
considered
without
however
producing
the
enormities
of
the
treaty
of
versailles
assuming
this
the
situation
may
be
stated
in
the
following
terms
all
the
illusions
as
to
the
capacity
of
germany
being
able
to
pay
have
fallen
to
pieces
and
the
indemnities
after
the
absurd
demands
which
tended
to
consider
as
inadequate
the
figure
of
milliards
and
an
annual
payment
of
from
ten
to
fifteen
milliards
have
become
an
anxious
unknown
quantity
as
troublesome
to
the
victors
as
to
the
vanquished
the
german
circulation
has
lost
all
control
under
the
force
of
internal
needs
and
germany
is
threatened
with
failure
the
other
debtors
turkey
bulgaria
have
need
of
succour
and
can
pay
nothing
austria
has
need
of
the
most
indispensable
objects
of
existence
and
everything
is
lacking
the
indemnity
which
germany
can
pay
annually
in
her
present
condition
can
not
calculating
goods
and
cash
payments
altogether
represent
more
than
two
or
three
milliards
at
the
most
the
victorious
countries
such
as
france
have
won
immense
territories
and
great
benefits
yet
they
have
not
been
able
to
pay
the
war
debts
contracted
abroad
and
not
even
the
interests
france
and
italy
being
countries
of
good
faith
have
demonstrated
that
if
they
can
not
pay
it
is
absurd
to
demand
the
payment
of
much
higher
sums
from
countries
like
germany
which
has
lost
almost
all
her
best
resources
mercantile
fleet
colonies
and
foreign
organization
etc
the
danger
exists
that
with
the
aggravation
of
the
situation
in
the
vanquished
countries
and
the
weakening
of
the
economic
structure
of
europe
the
vanquished
countries
will
drag
the
victors
down
with
them
to
ruin
while
the
peoples
standing
apart
from
continental
europe
will
detach
themselves
more
and
more
from
its
policy
the
situation
which
has
come
about
is
a
reason
for
everyone
to
be
anxious
and
threatens
both
the
downfall
of
the
vanquished
and
the
almost
inevitable
ruin
of
the
victors
unless
a
way
is
found
of
reconstructing
the
moral
unity
of
europe
and
the
solidarity
of
economic
life
vi
europe
reconstruction
and
peace
policy
no
person
has
nowadays
any
doubt
as
to
the
profound
injustice
of
the
treaty
of
versailles
and
of
all
the
treaties
which
derive
from
it
but
this
fact
is
of
small
importance
inasmuch
as
it
is
not
justice
or
injustice
which
regulates
the
relations
between
nations
but
their
interests
and
sentiments
in
the
past
we
have
seen
christian
peoples
transplanted
in
america
maintain
the
necessity
of
slavery
and
we
have
seen
and
continue
to
see
every
day
methods
of
reasoning
which
when
used
by
the
defeated
enemy
were
declared
to
be
fallacious
and
wrong
become
in
turn
when
varied
only
in
form
the
ideas
and
the
customary
life
of
the
conquerors
in
the
war
ideas
which
then
assume
the
quality
of
liberal
expressions
of
democracy
if
appeals
to
the
noblest
human
sentiments
are
not
made
in
vain
and
no
effort
of
goodness
or
generosity
is
ever
sterile
the
conviction
which
is
gradually
forming
itself
even
in
the
least
receptive
minds
that
the
treaties
of
peace
are
inapplicable
as
harmful
to
the
conquerors
as
to
the
conquered
gains
in
force
for
the
treaties
are
at
one
and
the
same
time
a
menace
for
the
conquerors
and
a
paralysis
of
all
activity
on
the
part
of
the
conquered
since
once
the
economic
unity
of
continental
europe
is
broken
the
resultant
depression
becomes
inevitable
if
many
errors
have
been
committed
many
errors
were
inevitable
what
we
must
try
to
do
now
is
to
limit
the
consequences
of
these
mistakes
in
a
changed
spirit
to
reconstruct
where
we
see
only
ruins
is
the
most
evident
necessity
we
must
also
try
to
diffuse
among
the
nations
which
have
won
the
war
together
and
suffered
together
the
least
amount
of
diffidence
possible
as
it
is
the
united
states
great
britain
france
italy
japan
all
go
their
own
way
france
has
obtained
her
maximum
of
concessions
including
those
of
least
use
to
her
but
never
before
has
the
world
seen
her
so
alone
in
her
attitude
as
after
the
treaties
of
paris
what
is
most
urgently
required
at
the
moment
is
to
change
the
prevalent
which
still
infects
us
and
overcomes
all
generous
sentiments
all
hopes
of
unity
the
statement
that
war
makes
men
better
or
worse
is
perhaps
an
exaggerated
one
war
which
creates
a
state
of
exaltation
hypertrophies
all
the
qualities
all
the
tendencies
be
they
for
good
or
for
evil
ascetic
souls
spirits
naturally
noble
being
disposed
toward
sacrifice
develop
a
state
of
exaltation
and
true
fervour
how
many
examples
of
nobility
of
abnegation
of
voluntary
martyrdom
has
not
the
war
given
us
but
in
persons
disposed
to
evil
actions
in
rude
and
violent
spirits
and
these
are
always
in
the
majority
the
spirit
of
violence
increases
this
spirit
which
among
the
intellectuals
takes
the
form
of
arrogance
and
concupiscence
and
in
politics
expresses
itself
in
a
policy
of
conquest
assumes
in
the
crowd
the
most
violent
forms
of
class
war
continuous
assaults
upon
the
power
of
the
state
and
an
unbalanced
desire
to
gain
as
much
as
possible
with
the
least
possible
work
before
the
war
the
number
of
men
ready
to
take
the
law
into
their
own
hands
was
relatively
small
now
there
are
many
such
individuals
the
various
nations
even
those
most
advanced
can
not
boast
a
moral
progress
comparable
with
their
intellectual
development
the
explosion
of
sentiments
of
violence
has
created
in
the
period
after
the
war
in
most
countries
an
atmosphere
which
one
may
call
unbreathable
peoples
accustomed
to
be
dominated
and
to
serve
have
come
to
believe
that
having
become
dominators
in
their
turn
they
have
the
right
to
use
every
kind
of
violence
against
their
overlords
of
yesterday
are
not
the
injustices
of
the
poles
against
the
germans
and
those
of
the
rumanians
against
the
magyars
a
proof
of
this
state
of
mind
even
in
the
most
civilized
countries
many
rules
of
order
and
discipline
have
gone
by
the
board
after
all
the
great
wars
a
condition
of
torpor
of
unwillingness
to
work
together
with
a
certain
rudeness
in
social
relations
has
always
been
noticed
the
war
of
was
a
little
war
in
comparison
with
the
cataclysm
let
loose
by
the
european
war
yet
then
the
conquered
country
had
its
attempt
at
bolshevism
which
in
those
days
was
called
the
commune
and
the
fall
of
its
political
regime
in
the
conquering
country
we
witnessed
together
with
the
rapid
development
of
industrial
groups
a
quick
growth
in
socialism
and
the
constitution
of
great
parties
like
the
catholic
centre
the
same
situation
has
shown
itself
after
the
european
war
what
is
most
urgently
necessary
therefore
is
to
effect
a
return
to
peace
sentiments
and
in
the
manifestations
of
government
to
abandon
those
attitudes
which
in
the
peaces
of
paris
had
their
roots
in
hate
i
have
tried
as
premier
of
italy
as
writer
and
as
politician
to
regulate
my
actions
by
this
principle
in
the
first
months
of
i
gave
instructions
to
italy
ambassador
in
vienna
the
marquis
della
torretta
to
arrange
a
meeting
between
himself
and
chancellor
renner
head
of
the
government
of
vienna
so
the
chief
of
the
conquered
country
came
together
with
his
ministers
to
greet
the
head
of
the
conquering
country
and
there
was
no
word
that
could
record
in
any
way
the
past
hatred
and
the
ancient
rancour
all
the
conversation
was
of
the
necessity
for
reconstruction
and
for
the
development
of
fresh
currents
of
life
and
commercial
activity
the
government
of
italy
helped
the
government
of
austria
in
so
far
as
was
possible
and
in
so
acting
i
felt
i
was
working
better
for
the
greatness
of
my
country
than
i
could
possibly
have
done
by
any
kind
of
stolid
persecution
i
felt
that
over
and
beyond
our
competition
there
existed
the
human
sorrow
of
nations
for
whom
we
must
avoid
fresh
shedding
of
blood
and
fresh
wars
had
i
not
left
the
government
it
was
my
intention
not
only
to
continue
in
this
path
but
also
to
intensify
my
efforts
in
this
direction
the
banal
idea
that
there
exist
in
europe
two
groups
of
nations
one
of
which
stands
for
violence
and
barbarism
the
germans
the
magyars
and
the
bulgarians
while
the
other
group
of
and
latins
represents
civilization
must
not
continue
to
be
repeated
because
not
only
is
it
an
outrage
on
truth
but
an
outrage
on
honesty
always
to
repeat
that
the
germans
are
not
adapted
for
a
democratic
regime
is
neither
just
nor
true
nor
is
it
true
that
germany
is
an
essentially
warlike
country
and
therefore
different
from
all
other
lands
in
the
last
three
centuries
france
and
england
have
fought
many
more
wars
than
germany
one
must
read
the
books
of
the
napoleonic
period
to
see
with
what
disdain
pacificist
germany
is
referred
to
that
country
of
peasants
waiters
and
philosophers
it
is
sufficient
to
read
the
works
of
german
writers
including
treitschke
himself
to
perceive
for
what
a
long
period
of
time
the
german
lands
anxious
for
peace
have
considered
france
as
the
country
always
eager
for
war
and
conquest
not
only
am
i
of
the
opinion
that
germany
is
a
land
suited
for
democratic
institutions
but
i
believe
that
after
the
fall
of
the
empire
democratic
principles
have
a
wider
prevalence
there
than
in
any
other
country
of
europe
the
resistance
offered
to
the
peace
of
versailles
that
is
to
disorganization
may
be
claimed
as
a
merit
for
the
democratic
parties
which
if
they
are
loyally
assisted
by
the
states
of
the
entente
can
not
only
develop
themselves
but
establish
a
great
and
noble
democracy
germany
has
accustomed
us
in
history
to
the
most
remarkable
surprises
a
century
and
a
half
ago
she
was
considered
as
a
pacificist
nation
without
national
spirit
she
has
since
then
become
a
warlike
country
with
the
most
pronounced
national
spirit
early
in
the
seventeenth
century
there
were
in
germany
more
than
one
hundred
territories
and
independent
states
there
was
no
true
national
conscience
and
not
even
the
violence
of
the
napoleonic
wars
a
century
after
sufficed
to
awaken
it
what
was
required
was
a
regular
effort
of
thought
a
sustained
programme
of
action
on
the
part
of
men
like
wolff
fichte
and
hegel
to
mould
a
national
conscience
fifty
years
earlier
no
one
would
have
believed
in
the
possibility
of
a
germany
united
and
compact
in
her
national
sentiment
germany
passed
from
the
widest
decentralization
to
the
greatest
concentration
and
the
intensest
national
life
germany
will
also
be
a
democratic
country
if
the
violence
of
her
ancient
enemies
does
not
drive
her
into
a
state
of
exaltation
which
will
tend
to
render
minds
and
spirits
favourable
to
a
return
to
the
old
regime
to
arrive
at
peace
we
must
first
of
all
desire
peace
we
must
no
longer
carry
on
conversations
by
means
of
military
missions
but
by
means
of
ambassadors
and
diplomatic
representatives
the
league
of
nations
and
the
participation
of
the
vanquished
a
great
step
towards
peace
may
be
made
by
admitting
at
once
all
states
into
the
league
of
nations
among
the
states
of
european
civilization
millions
of
persons
are
unrepresented
in
the
league
of
nations
the
united
states
who
has
not
wished
to
adhere
to
it
after
the
treaty
of
versailles
sanctioned
violence
russia
who
has
not
been
able
to
join
owing
to
her
difficult
position
germany
hungary
austria
and
bulgaria
who
have
not
been
permitted
to
join
the
turks
etc
the
league
of
nations
was
a
magnificent
conception
in
which
i
have
had
faith
and
which
i
have
regarded
with
sympathy
but
a
formidable
mistake
has
deprived
it
of
all
prestige
clauses
and
of
its
originating
constitution
and
the
exclusion
of
the
defeated
have
given
it
at
once
the
character
of
a
kind
of
holy
alliance
of
the
conquerors
established
to
regulate
the
incredible
relations
which
the
treaties
have
created
between
conquerors
and
conquered
wilson
had
already
committed
the
mistake
of
founding
the
league
of
nations
without
first
defining
the
nations
and
leaving
to
chance
the
resources
of
the
beaten
peoples
and
their
populations
the
day
however
on
which
all
the
peoples
are
represented
in
the
league
the
united
states
without
approving
the
treaties
of
versailles
germain
or
trianon
will
feel
the
need
of
abandoning
their
isolation
which
is
harmful
for
them
and
places
them
in
a
position
of
inferiority
and
the
day
when
all
the
peoples
of
the
world
are
represented
and
accept
reciprocal
pledges
of
international
solidarity
a
great
step
will
have
been
taken
as
things
stand
the
organism
of
the
reparations
commission
established
by
schedule
of
part
viii
of
the
treaty
of
versailles
is
an
absurd
union
of
the
conquerors
no
longer
allies
but
reunited
solely
in
a
kind
of
bankruptcy
procedure
who
interpret
the
treaty
in
their
own
fashion
and
can
even
modify
the
laws
and
regulations
in
the
conquered
countries
the
existence
of
such
an
institution
among
civilized
peoples
ought
to
be
an
impossibility
its
powers
must
be
transferred
to
the
league
of
nations
in
such
a
manner
as
to
provide
guarantees
for
the
victors
but
guarantees
also
for
the
conquered
the
suppression
of
the
reparations
commission
becomes
therefore
a
fundamental
necessity
the
revision
of
the
treaties
when
the
public
and
especially
in
the
united
states
and
great
britain
become
convinced
that
the
spirit
of
peace
can
only
prevail
by
means
of
an
honest
revision
of
the
treaties
the
difficulties
will
be
easily
eliminated
but
one
can
not
merely
speak
of
a
simple
revision
it
would
be
a
cure
worse
than
the
evil
during
the
tempest
one
can
not
abandon
the
ship
and
cross
over
to
a
safer
vessel
it
is
necessary
to
return
into
harbour
and
make
the
transhipment
where
calm
or
relative
calm
at
any
rate
reigns
inasmuch
as
europe
is
out
of
equilibrium
a
settlement
even
of
a
bad
kind
can
not
be
arrived
at
to
cast
down
the
present
political
scaffolding
without
having
built
anything
would
be
an
error
perhaps
here
the
method
that
will
prove
most
efficacious
is
to
entrust
the
league
of
nations
with
the
task
of
arriving
at
a
revision
when
the
league
of
nations
is
charged
with
this
work
the
various
governments
will
send
their
best
politicians
and
the
discussion
will
be
able
to
assume
a
realizable
character
according
to
its
constitution
the
league
of
nations
may
in
case
of
war
or
the
menace
of
war
clause
convoke
its
members
and
take
all
the
measures
required
to
safeguard
the
peace
of
the
nations
all
the
adhering
states
have
recognized
their
obligation
to
submit
all
controversies
to
arbitration
and
that
in
any
case
they
have
no
right
to
resort
to
war
before
the
expiration
of
a
term
of
three
months
after
the
verdict
of
the
arbiters
or
the
report
of
the
council
clause
any
member
of
the
league
of
nations
resorting
to
war
contrary
to
the
undertakings
of
the
treaty
which
constitutes
the
league
is
considered
as
if
he
had
committed
an
act
of
war
against
all
the
other
members
of
the
league
clause
but
more
important
still
is
the
fact
that
the
assembly
of
the
league
of
nations
may
invite
its
members
to
proceed
to
a
fresh
examination
of
treaties
that
become
inapplicable
as
well
as
of
international
situations
whose
prolongation
might
imperil
the
peace
of
the
world
clause
we
may
therefore
revise
the
present
treaties
without
violence
and
without
destroying
them
what
requires
to
be
modified
there
is
no
necessity
to
say
inasmuch
as
all
the
matter
of
this
book
supplies
the
evidence
and
the
proof
what
is
certain
is
that
in
europe
and
america
except
for
an
intransigent
movement
running
strong
in
france
everyone
is
convinced
of
the
necessity
of
revision
it
will
be
well
that
this
revision
should
take
place
through
the
operations
of
the
league
of
nations
after
the
representatives
of
all
the
states
conquerors
conquered
and
neutrals
have
come
to
form
part
of
it
but
in
the
constitution
of
the
league
of
nations
there
are
two
clauses
which
form
its
fundamental
weakness
sections
desired
by
france
whose
gravity
escaped
wilson
clause
declares
that
save
and
excepting
contrary
dispositions
the
decisions
of
the
assembly
or
of
the
council
are
to
be
by
the
unanimous
consent
of
the
members
represented
at
the
meetings
it
is
difficult
to
imagine
anything
more
absurd
if
the
modification
of
a
territorial
situation
is
being
discussed
all
the
nations
must
agree
as
to
the
solution
including
the
interested
nation
the
league
of
nations
is
convinced
that
the
danzig
corridor
is
an
absurdity
but
if
france
is
not
of
the
same
opinion
no
modification
can
be
made
without
a
change
of
this
clause
every
honest
attempt
at
revision
must
necessarily
break
down
clause
by
which
the
members
of
the
league
of
nations
pledge
themselves
to
respect
and
preserve
from
external
attacks
the
territorial
integrity
and
the
existing
political
independence
of
all
the
members
of
the
league
must
also
be
altered
this
clause
which
is
profoundly
immoral
consecrates
and
perpetuates
the
mistakes
and
faults
of
the
treaties
no
honest
country
can
guarantee
the
territorial
integrity
of
the
states
now
existing
after
the
monstrous
parcelling
out
of
entire
groups
of
germans
and
magyars
to
other
nations
arranged
without
scruples
and
without
intelligence
no
one
can
honestly
guarantee
the
territorial
integrity
of
poland
as
it
stands
at
present
if
a
russia
a
renewed
germany
and
an
unextinguished
austria
desire
in
the
future
a
revision
of
the
treaties
they
will
be
making
a
most
reasonable
demand
to
which
no
civilized
country
may
make
objection
it
is
indeed
clauses
and
which
have
deprived
the
constitution
of
the
league
of
nations
of
all
moral
credit
which
have
transformed
it
into
an
instrument
of
oppression
for
the
victors
which
have
caused
the
just
and
profound
disapproval
of
the
most
enlightened
men
of
the
american
senate
a
league
of
nations
with
clauses
and
and
the
prolonged
exclusion
of
the
vanquished
can
not
but
accentuate
the
diffidence
of
all
the
democracies
and
the
aversion
of
the
masses
but
the
league
of
nations
can
be
altered
and
can
become
indeed
a
great
force
for
renovation
if
the
problem
of
its
functioning
be
clearly
confronted
and
promptly
resolved
the
league
of
nations
can
become
a
great
guarantee
for
peace
on
three
conditions
a
that
it
include
really
and
in
the
shortest
space
of
time
possible
all
the
peoples
conquerors
conquered
and
neutrals
b
that
clauses
and
be
modified
and
that
after
their
modification
a
revision
of
the
treaties
be
undertaken
c
that
the
reparations
commission
be
abolished
and
its
powers
be
conferred
upon
the
league
of
nations
itself
as
it
exists
at
present
the
league
of
nations
has
neither
prestige
nor
dignity
it
is
an
expression
of
the
violence
of
the
conquering
group
of
nations
but
reconstituted
and
renovated
it
may
become
the
greatest
of
peace
factors
in
the
relations
between
the
peoples
the
safety
of
france
and
the
military
guarantees
in
the
state
of
mind
in
which
france
exists
at
present
there
is
a
reasonable
cause
of
worry
for
the
future
since
the
conclusion
of
the
war
the
united
states
of
america
have
withdrawn
they
concern
themselves
with
europe
no
more
or
only
in
a
very
limited
form
and
with
diffidence
the
monroe
doctrine
has
come
into
its
own
again
great
britain
watches
the
decadence
of
the
european
continent
but
girt
by
the
sea
has
nothing
to
fear
she
is
a
country
of
europe
but
she
does
not
live
the
life
of
europe
she
stands
apart
from
it
italy
when
she
has
overcome
the
difficulties
of
her
economic
situation
can
be
certain
of
her
future
the
very
fact
that
she
stands
in
direct
opposition
to
no
state
that
she
may
have
competition
with
various
peoples
but
not
hatreds
gives
italy
a
relative
security
but
france
who
has
been
in
less
than
years
twice
at
war
with
germany
has
little
security
for
her
future
germany
and
the
germanic
races
increase
rapidly
in
number
france
does
not
increase
france
notwithstanding
the
new
territories
after
her
war
losses
has
probably
no
more
inhabitants
than
in
in
her
almost
tormented
anxiety
to
destroy
germany
we
see
her
dread
for
the
future
more
indeed
than
mere
hatred
to
occupy
with
numerous
troops
the
left
bank
of
the
rhine
and
the
bridgeheads
is
an
act
of
vengeance
but
in
the
vengeance
there
is
also
anxiety
there
are
many
in
france
who
think
that
neither
now
nor
after
fifteen
years
must
the
territory
of
the
vanquished
be
abandoned
and
so
france
maintains
in
effective
force
too
large
an
army
and
nourishes
too
great
a
rancour
and
for
this
reason
she
helps
the
poles
in
their
unjustifiable
attempt
in
upper
silesia
will
not
allow
the
germans
of
austria
to
live
and
seeks
to
provoke
and
facilitate
all
movements
and
political
actions
which
can
tend
towards
the
dismemberment
of
germany
the
british
and
the
italian
viewpoints
are
essentially
different
france
which
knows
it
can
no
longer
count
on
the
of
great
britain
of
the
united
states
or
of
italy
keeps
on
foot
her
numerous
army
has
allied
herself
with
belgium
and
poland
and
tries
to
suffocate
germany
in
a
ring
of
iron
the
attempt
is
a
vain
one
and
destined
to
fail
within
a
few
years
inasmuch
as
france
allies
have
no
capacity
for
resistance
yet
all
the
same
her
attempt
derives
from
a
feeling
that
is
not
only
justifiable
but
just
france
had
obtained
at
paris
apart
from
the
occupation
of
the
left
bank
of
the
rhine
and
all
the
military
controls
two
guaranteeing
treaties
from
the
united
states
and
from
great
britain
in
case
of
unprovoked
aggression
on
the
part
of
germany
great
britain
and
the
united
states
pledged
themselves
to
defend
france
the
british
parliament
as
we
have
seen
approved
the
treaty
provisionally
on
the
similar
approbation
of
the
united
states
but
as
the
latter
has
not
approved
the
treaty
of
versailles
and
has
not
even
discussed
the
guarantee
treaty
france
has
now
no
guarantee
treaty
if
we
are
anxious
to
realize
a
peace
politic
two
things
are
necessary
that
france
has
security
and
that
for
twenty
years
at
least
great
britain
and
italy
pledge
themselves
to
defend
her
in
case
of
aggression
that
the
measures
for
the
disarmament
of
the
conquered
states
be
maintained
maybe
with
some
tempering
of
their
conditions
and
that
their
execution
and
control
be
entrusted
with
the
amplest
powers
to
the
league
of
nations
no
one
can
think
it
unjust
that
the
parties
who
provoked
the
war
or
those
who
have
if
not
the
entire
at
least
the
greatest
share
of
responsibility
should
be
rendered
for
a
certain
time
incapable
the
fall
of
the
military
caste
in
germany
and
the
formation
of
a
democratic
society
will
derive
much
help
from
the
abolition
for
a
not
too
brief
period
of
time
of
the
permanent
army
and
this
will
render
possible
at
no
distant
date
an
effective
reduction
of
the
armaments
in
the
victorious
countries
great
britain
has
the
moral
duty
to
proffer
a
guarantee
already
spontaneously
given
italy
also
must
give
such
a
guarantee
if
she
wishes
truly
to
contribute
towards
the
peace
of
europe
as
long
as
germany
has
no
fleet
and
can
not
put
together
an
artillery
and
an
aviation
corps
she
can
not
present
a
menace
great
britain
and
italy
can
however
only
give
their
guarantees
on
the
condition
that
they
guarantee
a
proper
state
of
things
and
not
a
continued
condition
of
violence
the
withdrawal
of
all
the
troops
from
the
rhine
ought
to
coincide
with
a
clear
definition
concerning
the
fate
of
the
germans
of
austria
and
the
germans
detached
from
germany
without
motive
such
a
retirement
must
coincide
with
the
definition
of
the
territory
of
the
saar
and
the
assigning
pure
and
simple
of
upper
silesia
to
germany
and
the
end
of
all
the
insupportable
controls
and
the
indemnity
regulations
being
myself
contrary
to
any
pledge
binding
italy
for
too
long
a
period
i
am
of
opinion
that
it
is
perfectly
right
that
great
britain
and
italy
should
make
this
sacrifice
for
the
peace
of
europe
but
no
guarantee
is
possible
either
for
great
britain
or
italy
until
the
most
essential
problems
be
resolved
in
the
justest
manner
by
means
of
straightforward
and
explicit
understandings
italy
tendency
towards
british
policy
on
the
continent
of
europe
depends
on
the
fact
that
great
britain
has
never
wished
or
tolerated
that
any
continental
state
should
have
a
hegemony
over
others
and
therefore
she
has
found
herself
at
different
epochs
ranged
against
france
germany
and
russia
england
is
in
the
mediterranean
solely
to
secure
her
passage
through
it
not
to
dominate
it
she
continues
to
follow
the
grand
policy
by
which
she
has
transformed
her
colonies
into
dominions
and
in
spite
of
errors
she
has
always
shown
the
greatest
respect
for
the
liberty
of
other
peoples
but
europe
will
not
have
peace
until
the
three
progressive
countries
of
the
continent
germany
france
and
italy
find
a
way
of
agreement
which
can
reunite
all
their
energies
in
one
common
force
russia
has
conceived
the
idea
of
having
the
hegemony
of
europe
germany
has
indeed
had
the
illusion
of
such
a
hegemony
now
this
illusion
penetrates
certain
french
elements
can
a
people
of
forty
million
inhabitants
who
are
not
increasing
who
already
find
difficulties
in
dominating
and
controlling
their
immense
colonies
aspire
to
hegemonic
action
even
taking
count
of
their
great
political
prestige
can
france
lastingly
dominate
and
menace
a
country
like
germany
which
at
no
distant
date
will
have
a
population
double
that
of
france
the
future
of
european
civilization
requires
that
germany
france
and
italy
after
so
much
disaster
find
a
common
road
to
travel
the
first
step
to
be
taken
is
to
give
security
of
existence
and
of
reconstruction
to
germany
the
second
is
to
guarantee
france
from
the
perils
of
a
not
distant
future
the
third
is
to
find
at
all
costs
a
means
of
accord
between
germany
france
and
italy
but
only
vast
popular
movements
and
great
currents
of
thought
and
of
life
can
work
effectively
in
those
cases
where
the
labours
of
politicians
have
revealed
themselves
as
characterized
by
uncertainty
and
as
being
too
traditional
europe
is
still
under
the
dominion
of
old
souls
which
often
enough
dwell
in
young
bodies
and
therefore
unite
old
errors
with
violence
a
great
movement
can
only
come
from
the
intellectuals
of
the
countries
most
menaced
and
from
fresh
popular
energies
regulating
debts
germany
indemnity
and
that
of
the
defeated
countries
these
two
problems
are
closely
connected
the
victorious
countries
demand
an
indemnity
from
the
conquered
countries
which
except
germany
who
has
a
great
productive
force
even
in
her
hour
of
difficulties
are
in
extreme
depression
and
misery
great
britain
is
in
debt
to
the
united
states
and
france
italy
and
minor
nations
are
in
their
turn
heavy
debtors
to
the
americans
and
to
great
britain
the
experience
of
the
last
three
years
has
shown
that
even
with
the
best
will
none
of
the
countries
owing
money
to
the
entente
has
been
able
to
pay
its
debts
or
even
the
interest
with
an
effort
great
britain
could
pay
france
and
italy
will
never
be
able
to
and
have
moreover
exchanges
which
constitute
a
real
menace
for
the
future
of
each
the
fact
that
france
and
italy
although
they
came
out
of
the
war
victoriously
have
not
been
able
to
pay
their
debts
or
even
the
interest
on
them
is
the
proof
that
germany
whose
best
resources
have
been
taken
away
from
her
can
only
pay
an
indemnity
very
different
from
the
fantastic
figures
put
forward
at
the
time
of
the
conference
of
paris
when
even
important
political
men
spoke
of
monstrous
and
ridiculous
indemnities
the
problem
of
the
debts
as
well
as
that
of
the
indemnity
will
be
solved
by
a
certain
sacrifice
on
the
part
of
all
who
participated
in
the
war
the
credits
of
the
united
states
amount
to
almost
milliards
of
lire
or
francs
at
par
and
the
credits
of
great
britain
to
milliards
great
britain
owes
about
milliards
to
the
united
states
and
is
in
turn
creditor
for
some
milliards
she
has
a
bad
debt
owing
from
russia
for
more
than
milliards
but
milliards
are
owing
from
france
about
milliards
from
italy
and
almost
milliards
from
belgium
that
is
to
say
that
great
britain
could
well
pay
her
debt
to
the
united
states
ceding
the
greater
part
of
her
credits
towards
france
and
italy
but
the
truth
is
that
while
on
the
subject
of
the
german
indemnities
stolid
illusions
continue
to
be
propagated
perhaps
now
with
greater
discretion
neither
france
nor
italy
is
in
a
position
to
pay
its
debts
the
most
honest
solution
which
intelligently
enough
keynes
has
seen
from
the
first
is
that
each
of
the
countries
should
renounce
its
state
credits
towards
countries
that
were
allies
or
associates
during
the
war
the
united
states
of
america
are
creditors
only
great
britain
has
lent
the
double
of
what
she
has
borrowed
france
has
received
on
loan
the
triple
of
what
she
has
lent
to
others
the
credits
of
france
are
for
almost
undemandable
credits
of
great
britain
more
than
milliards
being
with
russia
they
are
for
considerably
more
than
bad
debts
france
and
italy
would
be
benefited
chiefly
by
this
provision
great
britain
would
scarcely
either
benefit
or
lose
or
rather
the
benefit
accruing
to
her
would
be
less
in
so
much
as
her
chief
credits
are
to
russia
the
united
states
would
doubtless
have
to
bear
the
largest
burden
but
when
one
thinks
of
the
small
sacrifice
which
the
united
states
has
made
in
comparison
with
the
efforts
of
france
and
italy
and
italy
was
not
obliged
to
enter
the
war
the
new
sacrifice
demanded
does
not
seem
excessive
during
the
war
the
united
states
of
america
who
for
three
years
furnished
food
provisions
and
arms
to
the
countries
of
the
entente
have
absorbed
the
greater
part
of
their
available
resources
not
only
are
the
states
of
europe
debtors
but
so
are
especially
the
private
citizens
who
have
contracted
debts
during
or
after
the
war
great
britain
during
the
war
had
to
sell
at
least
milliards
of
her
foreign
values
the
united
states
of
america
on
the
contrary
have
immensely
increased
their
reserves
but
this
very
increase
is
harmful
to
them
inasmuch
as
the
capacity
for
exchange
of
the
states
of
europe
has
been
much
reduced
the
united
states
now
risk
seeing
still
further
reduced
if
not
destroyed
this
purchasing
capacity
of
their
best
clients
and
this
finally
constitutes
for
the
infinitely
greater
damage
than
the
renouncing
of
all
their
credits
to
reconstruct
germany
to
intensify
exchange
of
goods
with
the
old
countries
of
and
russia
to
settle
the
situation
of
the
exchange
of
goods
with
italy
and
the
balkan
countries
is
much
more
important
for
the
united
states
and
the
prosperity
of
its
people
than
to
demand
payment
or
not
demand
payment
of
those
debts
made
for
the
common
cause
i
will
speak
of
the
absurd
situation
which
has
come
about
and
poland
unwillingly
indeed
fought
against
the
entente
which
has
raised
them
to
free
and
autonomous
states
and
not
only
have
they
no
debts
to
pay
being
now
in
the
position
of
conquerors
or
at
least
allies
of
the
conquerors
but
they
have
in
fact
scarcely
any
foreign
debts
the
existence
of
enormous
war
debts
is
then
everywhere
a
menace
to
financial
stability
no
one
is
anxious
to
repudiate
his
debts
in
order
not
to
suffer
in
loss
of
dignity
but
almost
all
know
that
they
can
not
pay
the
end
of
the
war
as
keynes
has
justly
written
has
brought
about
that
all
owe
immense
sums
of
money
to
one
another
the
holders
of
loan
stock
in
every
country
are
creditors
for
vast
sums
towards
the
state
and
the
state
in
its
turn
is
creditor
for
enormous
sums
towards
the
taxpayers
the
whole
situation
is
highly
artificial
and
irritating
we
shall
be
unable
to
move
unless
we
succeed
in
freeing
ourselves
from
this
chain
of
paper
the
work
of
reconstruction
can
begin
by
annulling
the
debts
if
it
is
not
thought
desirable
to
proceed
at
once
to
annulment
there
remains
only
the
solution
of
including
them
in
the
indemnity
which
germany
must
pay
in
the
measure
of
per
allocating
a
certain
proportion
to
each
country
which
has
made
loans
to
allied
and
associated
governments
on
account
of
the
war
in
round
figures
the
loans
come
to
milliards
they
can
be
reduced
to
and
then
each
creditor
can
renounce
his
respective
credit
towards
allies
or
associates
and
participate
proportionately
in
the
new
credit
towards
germany
such
a
credit
bearing
no
interest
could
only
be
demanded
after
the
payment
of
all
the
other
indemnities
and
would
be
considered
in
the
complete
total
of
the
indemnities
all
the
illusions
concerning
the
indemnities
are
now
fated
to
disappear
they
have
already
vanished
for
the
other
countries
they
are
about
to
vanish
in
the
case
of
germany
nevertheless
it
is
right
that
germany
should
pay
an
indemnity
yet
if
the
conquerors
can
not
meet
their
foreign
debts
how
can
the
vanquished
clear
the
vast
indemnity
asked
each
passing
day
demonstrates
more
clearly
the
misunderstanding
of
the
indemnity
the
have
not
learned
financial
technics
but
common
sense
tells
them
that
the
golden
nimbus
which
has
been
trailed
before
their
eyes
is
only
a
thick
cloud
of
smoke
that
is
slowly
dissipating
i
have
already
said
that
the
real
damages
to
repair
do
not
exceed
milliards
of
gold
marks
and
that
all
the
other
figures
are
pure
exaggerations
if
it
be
agreed
that
germany
accept
per
cent
of
the
debt
the
indemnity
may
be
raised
to
milliards
of
francs
at
par
to
be
paid
in
gold
marks
but
we
must
calculate
for
germany
benefit
all
that
she
has
already
given
in
immediate
marketable
wealth
apart
from
her
colonies
germany
has
given
up
all
her
mercantile
marine
fleet
her

without

of

and

germany
has
parted
with
at

milliards
if
we
were
to
calculate
what
germany
has
ceded
with
the
same
criteria
with
which
the
conquering
countries
have
calculated
their
losses
we
should
arrive
at
figures
much
surpassing
these
we
may
agree
in
taxing
germany
with
an
indemnity
equivalent
in
gold
marks
to
milliards
of
francs
at
par
an
indemnity
to
be
paid
in
the
following
manner
a
twenty
milliards
of
francs
to
be
considered
as
already
paid
in
consideration
of
all
that
germany
has
ceded
in
consequence
of
the
treaties
b
twenty
milliards
from
the
indemnity
which
germany
must
pay
to
her
conquerors
especially
in
coal
and
other
materials
according
to
the
proportions
already
established
c
twenty
milliards
after
the
payment
of
the
debts
in
the
second
category
to
be
taken
over
by
germany
as
part
of
the
reimbursement
for
countries
which
have
made
credits
to
the
belligerents
of
the
entente
that
is
the
united
states
great
britain
and
france
in
proportion
to
the
sums
lent
in
what
material
can
germany
pay
milliards
in
a
few
years
especially
in
coal
and
in
material
for
repairing
the
devastated
territories
of
france
germany
must
pledge
herself
for
ten
years
to
consign
to
france
a
quantity
of
coal
at
least
equal
in
bulk
to
the
difference
between
the
annual
production
before
the
war
in
the
mines
of
the
north
and
in
the
pas
de
calais
and
the
production
of
the
mines
in
the
same
area
during
the
next
ten
years
she
must
also
furnish
italy
who
after
the
heavy
losses
sustained
has
not
the
possibility
of
effecting
exchanges
a
quantity
of
coal
that
will
represent
of
the
figures
settled
upon
in
the
treaty
of
versailles
we
can
compel
germany
to
give
to
the
allies
for
ten
years
in
extinction
of
their
credits
at
least
millions
a
year
in
gold
with
privileges
on
the
customs
receipts
this
systematization
which
can
only
be
imposed
by
the
free
agreement
of
the
united
states
and
great
britain
would
have
the
effect
of
creating
excellent
relations
the
united
states
cancelling
their
in
great
part
impossible
debt
would
derive
the
advantage
of
developing
their
trade
and
industry
and
thus
be
able
to
guarantee
credits
for
private
individuals
in
europe
it
would
also
be
of
advantage
to
great
britain
who
would
lose
nothing
great
britain
has
about
an
equal
number
of
debits
and
credits
with
this
difference
that
the
debits
are
secured
while
the
credits
are
in
part
unsecured
credits
are
proportionately
the
worst
and
her
debits
largest
almost
milliards
france
liberated
from
her
debt
and
in
a
position
to
calculate
on
a
coal
situation
comparable
with
that
of
before
the
war
and
with
her
new
territories
would
be
in
a
position
to
herself
the
cancellation
of
milliards
of
debt
a
proportionate
share
in
milliards
together
with
all
that
she
has
had
represent
on
the
whole
a
sum
that
perhaps
exceeds
milliards
italy
would
have
the
advantage
of
possessing
for
ten
years
the
minimum
of
coal
necessary
to
her
existence
and
would
be
liberated
from
her
foreign
debt
which
amounts
to
much
more
than
she
can
possibly
hope
for
from
the
indemnity
such
an
arrangement
or
one
like
it
is
the
only
way
calculated
to
allow
europe
to
set
out
again
on
the
path
of
civilization
and
to
slowly
that
economic
equilibrium
which
the
war
has
destroyed
with
enormous
damage
for
the
conquerors
and
the
certain
ruin
of
the
vanquished
but
before
speaking
of
any
indemnity
the
reparations
commission
must
be
abolished
and
its
functions
handed
over
to
the
league
of
nations
while
all
the
useless
controls
and
other
hateful
vexations
must
be
put
an
end
to
while
the
allied
troops
occupation
of
the
rhine
costs
germany
milliards
of
paper
marks
a
year
it
is
foolish
to
speak
of
reconstruction
or
indemnity
either
all
occupation
must
cease
or
the
expenses
ought
not
to
exceed
according
to
the
foregoing
agreements
a
maximum
of
millions
at
par
or
even
less
we
shall
however
never
arrive
at
such
an
arrangement
until
the
continental
countries
become
convinced
of
two
things
first
that
the
united
states
will
grant
no
credits
under
any
formula
secondly
that
germany
under
the
present
system
will
be
unable
to
pay
anything
and
will
collapse
dragging
down
to
ruin
her
conquerors
among
many
uncertainties
these
two
convictions
become
ever
clearer
if
in
all
countries
the
spirit
of
insubordination
among
the
working
classes
is
increasing
the
state
of
mind
of
the
german
operatives
is
quite
remarkable
the
workmen
almost
everywhere
in
face
of
the
enormous
fortunes
which
the
war
has
created
and
by
reason
of
the
spirit
of
violence
working
in
them
have
worked
with
bad
spirit
after
the
war
because
they
have
thought
that
a
portion
of
their
labour
has
gone
to
form
the
profits
of
the
industrials
it
is
useless
to
say
that
we
are
dealing
here
with
an
absurd
and
dangerous
conception
because
the
profit
of
the
capitalist
is
a
necessary
element
of
production
and
because
production
along
communist
lines
wherever
it
has
been
attempted
has
brought
ruin
and
misery
but
it
is
useless
to
deny
that
such
a
situation
exists
together
with
the
state
of
mind
which
it
implies
we
can
well
imagine
then
the
conditions
in
which
germany
and
the
vanquished
countries
find
themselves
the
workmen
who
in
france
england
and
italy
exhibit
in
various
degree
and
measure
a
state
of
intractability
in
germany
have
to
face
a
situation
still
graver
when
they
work
they
know
that
a
portion
of
their
labour
is
destined
to
go
to
the
victors
another
part
to
the
capitalist
and
finally
there
will
remain
something
for
them
add
to
this
that
in
all
the
beaten
countries
hunger
is
widespread
with
a
consequent
diminution
of
energy
and
work
no
reasonable
person
can
explain
how
humanity
can
continue
to
believe
in
the
perpetuation
of
a
similar
state
of
things
for
another
forty
years
in
speaking
of
the
indemnity
which
germany
can
pay
it
is
necessary
to
consider
this
special
state
of
mind
of
the
operatives
and
other
categories
of
producers
but
the
mere
announcement
of
the
settling
of
the
indemnity
of
the
immediate
admission
of
the
vanquished
nations
into
the
league
of
nations
of
the
settling
the
question
of
the
occupation
of
the
rhine
and
of
the
firm
intention
to
modify
the
constitution
of
the
league
of
nations
according
it
the
powers
now
held
by
the
reparations
commission
will
improve
at
once
the
market
and
signalize
a
definite
and
assured
revival
the
united
states
made
a
great
financial
effort
to
assist
their
associates
and
in
their
own
interests
as
well
as
for
those
of
europe
they
would
have
done
badly
to
have
continued
with
such
assistance
when
the
means
provided
by
america
come
to
be
employed
to
keep
going
the
anarchy
of
central
europe
rumania
disorder
adventures
and
poland
violences
together
with
denikin
and
wrangel
restoration
attempts
it
is
better
that
all
help
should
cease
in
fact
europe
has
begun
to
reason
a
little
better
than
her
governments
since
the
financial
difficulties
have
increased
the
fall
of
the
mark
and
germany
profound
economic
depression
have
already
destroyed
a
great
part
of
the
illusions
on
the
subject
of
the
indemnity
and
the
figures
with
which
for
three
years
the
public
has
been
humbugged
no
longer
convince
anyone
forming
new
connexions
with
russia
among
the
states
of
the
entente
there
is
always
a
fundamental
discord
on
the
subject
of
russia
great
britain
recognized
at
once
that
if
it
were
impossible
to
acknowledge
the
soviet
government
it
was
a
mistake
to
encourage
attempts
at
restoration
after
the
first
moments
of
uncertainty
great
britain
has
insisted
on
temperate
measures
and
notwithstanding
that
during
the
war
she
made
the
largest
loans
to
the
russian
government
more
than
milliards
of
francs
at
par
while
france
only
lent
about
milliards
she
has
never
put
forward
the
idea
that
as
a
condition
precedent
to
the
recognition
of
the
soviet
government
a
guarantee
of
the
repayment
of
the
debt
was
necessary
only
france
has
had
this
mistaken
idea
which
she
has
forced
to
the
point
of
asking
for
the
sequestration
of
all
gold
sent
abroad
by
the
soviet
government
for
the
purchase
of
goods
wilson
had
already
stated
in
his
fourteen
points
what
the
attitude
of
the
entente
towards
russia
ought
to
be
but
the
attitudes
actually
assumed
have
been
of
quite
a
different
order
the
barrier
which
poland
wants
to
construct
between
germany
and
russia
is
an
absurdity
which
must
be
swept
away
at
once
having
taken
away
germany
colonies
and
her
capacities
for
expansion
abroad
we
must
now
direct
her
towards
russia
where
alone
she
can
find
the
outlet
necessary
for
her
enormous
population
and
the
debt
she
has
to
carry
the
blockade
of
russia
the
barbed
wire
placed
round
russia
have
damaged
europe
severely
this
blockade
has
resolved
itself
into
a
blockade
against
the
allies
before
the
present
state
of
economic
ruin
russia
was
the
great
reservoir
of
raw
materials
she
was
the
unexplored
treasure
towards
which
one
went
with
the
confidence
of
finding
everything
now
owing
to
her
effort
she
has
fallen
but
how
large
a
part
of
her
fall
is
as
much
due
to
the
entente
as
to
her
action
during
the
war
and
since
for
some
time
now
even
the
most
hidebound
intelligences
have
recognized
the
fact
that
it
is
useless
to
talk
of
entering
into
trade
relations
with
russia
without
the
of
germany
the
obvious
ally
in
the
vast
task
of
renovation
similarly
it
is
useless
to
talk
of
reattempting
military
manoeuvres
while
germany
remains
disassociated
from
the
work
of
reconstruction
and
feels
herself
menaced
by
a
poland
that
is
anarchical
and
disorderly
and
acts
as
an
agent
of
the
entente
while
germany
has
no
security
for
her
future
and
must
work
with
doubt
and
with
rancour
all
attempts
to
reconstruct
russia
will
be
vain
the
simple
and
fundamental
truth
is
just
this
one
can
only
get
to
moscow
by
passing
through
berlin
if
we
do
not
wish
conquerors
and
conquered
to
fall
one
after
the
other
and
a
common
fate
to
reunite
those
who
for
too
long
have
hated
each
other
and
continue
to
hate
each
other
a
solemn
word
of
peace
must
be
pronounced
austria
germany
italy
france
are
not
diverse
phenomena
they
are
different
phases
of
the
same
phenomenon
all
europe
will
go
to
pieces
if
new
conditions
of
life
are
not
found
and
the
economic
equilibrium
profoundly
shaken
by
the
war
i
have
sought
in
this
book
to
point
out
in
all
sincerity
the
things
that
are
in
store
for
europe
what
perils
menace
her
and
in
what
way
her
regeneration
lies
in
my
political
career
i
have
found
many
bitternesses
but
the
campaign
waged
against
me
has
not
disturbed
me
at
all
i
know
that
wisdom
and
life
are
indivisible
and
i
have
no
need
to
modify
anything
of
what
i
have
done
neither
in
my
propaganda
nor
in
my
attempt
at
human
regeneration
convinced
as
i
am
that
i
am
serving
both
the
cause
of
my
country
and
the
cause
of
civilization
blame
and
praise
do
not
disturb
me
and
the
agitations
promoted
in
the
heart
of
my
country
will
not
modify
in
any
way
my
conviction
on
the
contrary
they
will
only
reinforce
my
will
to
follow
in
my
own
way
truth
be
it
only
slowly
makes
its
way
though
now
the
clouds
are
blackest
they
will
shortly
disappear
the
crisis
which
menaces
and
disturbs
europe
so
profoundly
has
inoculated
with
alarm
the
most
excited
spirits
europe
is
still
in
the
phase
