the
plants
intended
for
large
specimens
must
receive
their
final
shift
and
be
allowed
sufficient
space
to
expand
their
foliage
without
interfering
with
or
injuring
each
other
the
to
be
tied
out
as
some
of
them
will
be
preparing
to
burst
into
flower
a
little
arrangement
may
be
necessary
in
tying
them
out
to
display
their
spikes
of
bloom
more
advantageously
if
wanted
early
the
plants
that
were
first
put
to
rest
should
be
selected
and
be
fresh
potted
cutting
back
the
roots
beginning
with
a
pot
to
be
shifted
into
larger
when
the
roots
have
extended
to
the
outside
of
the

place
them
in
a
nice
moist
temperature
of
by

and
by

to
be
looked
over
and
the
dead
and
decaying

such
as
the
and
many
others
to
be
tied
out
and
arranged
for
the
season
when
large

are
wanted
tie
out
the
branches
at
equal
distances
and
down
as
near
to
the
rim
of
the

as
possible
air
to
be
given
at
all
favourable
opportunities
water
to
be
given
but
sparingly
and
not
overhead
stove
and
be
careful
that
the
night
temperature
is
not
raised
too
high
if
kept
at
in
severe
weather
no
ill
consequences
will
result
the
atmosphere
to
be
kept
rather
moist
especially
if
the
weather
is
bright
and
all
plants
indicating
an
appearance
of
starting
into
bloom
to
be
removed
to
the
warmest
part
of
the
house
to
be
shaken
out
of
their
pots
their
roots
reduced
and
repotted
into
small
pots
in
a
light
sandy
loamy
compost
sow
seeds
and
also
of
any
stove
plants
water
to
be
given
very
cautiously
to
the
orchids
merely
sufficient
to
prevent
the
plants
from
shrivelling
and
to
do
this
effectually
it
is
necessary
to
look
over
them
every
day
the
air
of
the
house
to
be
kept
moist
by
sprinkling
the
pathways
floors
tables
daily
if
any
plant
is
found
not
to
have
ripened
off
its
bulbs
it
should
be
placed
in
the
warmest
part
of
the
house
and
the
ripening
process
encouraged
the
brassias
cyanoches
coelogynes
miltonias
and
other
such
plants
when
they
are
beginning
to
grow
to
be
repotted
the
compost
to
consist
of
turfy
peat
mixed
with
a
portion
of
charcoal
or
broken
potsherds
and
the
pots
to
be
at
least
half
full
of
very
open
drainage
very
gentle
excitement
to
be
given
by
fire
or
artificial
heat
with
kindly
humidity
and
abundance
of
air
although
they
will
bear
a
higher
degree
of
temperature
without
injury
than
either
cherries
or
peaches
it
is
advisable
to
begin
cautiously
as
it
frequently
happens
that
the
more
haste
with
fire
the
less
speed
with
fruit
and
that
favourable
opportunities
of
sun
and
light
must
be
embraced
for
making
sure
progress
with
them
where
the
trees
are
coming
into
bloom
it
is
necessary
to
be
cautious
in
the
application
of
humidity
and
when
they
have
expanded
their
flowers
to
withhold
it
altogether
for
a
time
fire
or
other
artificial
heat
to
be
applied
moderately
that
is
from
by
night
to
by
day
particularly
when
dark
and
gloomy
weather
prevails
the
houses
now
commencing
to
force
to
be
kept
moderately
moist
and
in
a
sweet
healthy
state
syringing
the
trees
pretty
freely
once
or
twice
with
tepid
water
shut
up
early
on
sunny
days
and
sprinkle
the
paths
floors
flues
or
pipes
frequently
when
they
have
all
broken
the
superfluous
buds
must
be
rubbed
off
and
the
young
shoots
stopped
as
soon
as
they
are
long
enough
to
admit
the
points
of
the
shoots
at
one
bud
above
the
bunch
being
broken
out
in
vineries
now
commencing
to
force
adopt
the
practice
of
producing
where
it
can
be
applied
a
kindly
humidity
by
means
of
dung
and
leaves
or
other
such
fermenting
materials
if
they
are
to
be
broken
principally
by
fire
heat
either
by
flues
or
pipes
copious
syringings
must
be
resorted
to
with
tepid
water
once
or
twice
fire
heat
to
be
applied
principally
by
day
with
air
at
the
same
time
and
very
moderately
at
night
second
week
greenhouse
and
conservatory
the
plants
will
now
require
particular
attention
and
a
nice
discrimination
in
the
application
of
water
it
may
be
comprehended
by
all
persons
interested
in
gardening
operations
that
when
the
soil
on
the
surface
of
the
pot
looks
damp
it
will
not
require
water
until
it
gets
thoroughly
dry
at
this
season
and
then
it
is
to
be
given
before
the
plant
droops
or
flags
for
want
of
it
but
when
the
plant
droops
and
the
soil
on
the
surface
appears
damp
the
cause
is
then
to
be
discovered
by
turning
the
ball
out
of
the
pot
when
it
will
be
seen
whether
the
whole
or
only
a
portion
of
the
soil
is
wet
as
it
sometimes
happens
when
fresh
potted
with
light
soil
it
shrinks
from
the
sides
of
the
pot
when
dry
and
when
water
is
given
it
runs
down
and
moistens
the
outside
without
penetrating
the
ball
the
evil
is
corrected
by
holding
it
for
a
short
space
of
time
in
a
tub
of
water
of
the
same
temperature
as
the
house
if
the
soil
of
any
plant
is
sodden
with
water
it
should
be
turned
out
of
the
pot
and
the
drainage
examined
and
no
water
to
be
given
until
it
becomes
thoroughly
dry
they
require
to
be
kept
tolerably
dry
as
they
are
more
susceptible
of
injury
from
damp
than
from
cold
a
top
shelf
near
the
glass
in
the
greenhouse
is
a
very
suitable
place
for
them
if
mildew
appears
to
be
dusted
with
flowers
of
sulphur
stove
and
although
all
plants
now
at
rest
should
be
kept
comparatively
dry
they
will
require
to
be
looked
over
daily
to
see
that
they
do
not
suffer
for
want
of
water
the
temperature
not
to
exceed
by
fire
heat
and
a
fall
of
may
be
allowed
at
night
in
very
cold
weather
many
of
the
stove
plants
such
as
aphelandras
justicias
poinsettias
may
now
be
cut
down
altogether
and
kept
dry
for
a
few
weeks
which
will
cause
them
to
make
an
early
growth
and
to
come
into
flower
a
few
weeks
sooner
next
winter
select
a
few
roots
of
them
and
a
few
of
the
gloxinias
to
start
into
growth
to
produce
a
succession
of
flowers
if
the
soil
in
the
bed
is
dry
give
it
a
liberal
supply
of
water
so
that
it
may
descend
to
the
roots
as
unproductiveness
is
sometimes
caused
by
the
soil
at
the
roots
being
very
dry
when
the
top
is
kept
moist
by
gentle
waterings
beans
dwarf
kidney
sow
every
three
weeks
if
a
constant
supply
is
wanted
keep
the
early
crops
well
supplied
with
water
and
give
them
frequent
sprinklings
overhead
to
prevent
the
attacks
of
red
spider
an
abundance
of
water
to
be
thrown
about
the
floors
if
the
beds
are
dry

be
syringed
with
lukewarm
water

it
like

intervals
for
a
few
hours

in
favourable
weather
continue
previous
directions
the
trees
in
bloom
to
be
artificially
impregnated
and
the
foreright
shoots
to
be
rubbed
off
a
few
at
a
time
before
they
become
too
large
currents
of
air
to
be
carefully
avoided
especially
when
the
trees
are
in
bloom
as
they
have
been
sometimes
observed
to
sustain
injury

be
given

the
top
daily
in
favourable
weather
as
the
days
lengthen
and
the
light
increases
the
plants
that
are
swelling
their
fruit
should
be
supplied
with
a
gradual
increase
of
heat
from
at
night
to
or
in
the
middle
of
the
day
in
clear
weather
water
and
atmospheric
moisture
while
others
that
are
in

and
starting
into

their
growth
for
fruiting
in
may
or
june
in
pits
or
houses
where
the
flues
run
near

be
closely
examined

may
be
placed
in
a
frame
where
there
is
a
gentle
heat
and
an
atmosphere
more
congenial
to
their
healthy
growth

of
gardening
are
likely
to
occupy
more

well
spared
as
spring
operations
accumulate
very
fast
it
is
advisable
to
proceed
with
the
potting
of

from
this
time
forward
beginning
with
those
that
are
showing

of
growth
peat
cut

cubes
fresh
sphagnum
to
be
soaked
in
boiling

to
destroy

and
charcoal
lumps
with
an
abundance
of
crocks
are
the
materials
to
be
used
any
plants
that
had
become
very
dry
should
be
immersed
in
tepid
water
for
an
hour
the
day
previous
to
shifting
the
climate
of
the
countries
and
the
localities
from
whence
the
species
come
are
the
best
guides
to
their
successful
cultivation
as
the
treatment
required
for
would
kill
and
will
thrive
where
will
die
and
in
like
manner
with
many
others
sow
seeds
of
the
large
sort
in
pans
or
pots
to
be
placed
in
heat
when
the
seedlings
are
an
inch
or
two
high
pot
them
singly
into
small
pots
and
replace
them
in

to
be
afterwards
shifted
when
necessary
until
the
end

may
when
they
may
be
planted
out
on
a
south
border
plenty
of

atmospheric
moisture
and
a
very
moderate
temperature
are
the
requisites
for
them

be
enough
to
maintain

plants
if
the
weather
is
very
dull
and
unfavourable
for
giving
air
where
the
trees
are
in
bloom
it
is
advisable
to
shake
the
trellis
towards
noon
for
dispersing
the
pollen
proceed
with
the
routine
as
advised
in
last
calendar
keep
them
close

remember
that

maximum
with
an
atmospheric
warmth

in
such
a
situation
they
will
want
scarcely
any

until
they
begin
to
throw
up
their
sow
seed
of
the
large
to
be
treated
as
advised
for
capsicums
to
be
looked
over
carefully
and
as
soon
as
they
are
sufficiently
forward
to
distinguish
the

to
be
removed
that
is
all
that
do
not
show

it
may
also
be
necessary
to
take
off

we
have
lately

the
beneficial

close
pruning
on
such

they
had
been
cut
in

last
season
by
removing
strong

watered
and
introduced
to

the
plants
treated
in
that
manner
are

and
fixing
them
to
a
wire

or

attached
to
the
rim
of
the
pot
by
such
means
the
nakedness
of
the
plant
at

placed

a
little
before

which
will
be
of
some
assistance
to

without
much

of

it
is
advisable
to
use
no
more
artificial

is
absolutely
necessary
the
drying
effects
of

must
be
counteracted
by
a

condensed

falls
in

that
are
apt

spoil
the
beauty
of

and
to

the
best
corrective
for

results
is
to
be
found
in
keeping
the

as
low
as
may
be
consistent

in

do
not
expose

as
our

are
from

with
different

it
is
difficult
to

so
satisfactorily
as
where
there
are
two
divisions
the

commanding
a

there
is

may
be
taken
of

vacant
spot
in
the
they
will
be
found
to
bear
fruit
abundantly
with
common
care
it
is
a
more
certain
method
of
obtaining
fruit
than
by
potting
them
when
started
and
until
the
buds
are
fairly
broken
endeavour
to
keep
the
points
of
the
shoots
nearly
on
a
level
with
the
lowest
part
of
the
vine
and
if
that
should
not
be
found
sufficient
to
induce
the
buds
to
start
regularly
throughout
the
whole
length
of
the
vine
the
rod
should
be
bent
so
as
to
bring
the
most
forward
buds
to
the
lowest
level
and
elevating
those
that
are
backward
a
moist
atmosphere
to
be
kept
up
by
sprinkling
the
floor
and
paths
and
by
syringing
the
vines
lightly
every
morning
and
evening
until
the
leaves
begin
to
appear
when
the
supply
of
moisture
will
not
be
so
much
required
introduce
a
lot
in
pots
to
some
house
pit
or
frame
prepared
with
leaves
or
manure
if
not
done
as
advised
last
week
at
first
vines
in
pots
are
most
useful
for
early
work
as
they
in
many
places
save
the
established
vines
in
houses
from
the
hazardous
operation
of
early
excitement
increase
the
temperature
slightly
when
the
buds
are
beginning
to
swell
or
are
starting
a
little
the
fermenting
material
in
the
house
to
be
stirred
up
occasionally
this
fermenting
material
should
if
possible
consist
of
a
large
proportion
of
leaves
mixed
with
the
dung
to
prevent
the
steam
from
the
latter
discolouring
the
rafters
and
sashes
and
if
the
vapour
is
likely
to
be
too
strong
a
thin
covering
of
sawdust
or
old
tan
will
prevent
any
injurious
effects
if
the
roots
are
outside
the
house
and
had
been
covered
before
the
commencement
of
frost
as
advised
some
more
dung
and
leaves
should
be
added
to
keep
up
a
genial
heat
in
the
border
the
good
effects
of
which
will
be
soon
evident
in
the
progress
of
the
vines
inside
when
the
grapes
are
all
cut
in
the
late
houses
the
vines
to
be
pruned
immediately
and
the
cuts
to
be
covered
with
white
lead
