a
foreword
the
and
tendency
of
this
hurrying
grasping
competing
age
is
the
excuse
for
this
booklet
is
it
not
an
absolute
necessity
to
get
rid
of
all
irritants
of
everything
which
worries
and
frets
and
which
brings
discord
into
so
many
lives
cheerfulness
has
a
wonderful
lubricating
power
it
lengthens
the
life
of
human
machinery
as
lubricants
lengthen
the
life
of
inert
machinery
life
delicate
bearings
should
not
be
carelessly
ground
away
for
mere
lack
of
oil
what
is
needed
is
a
habit
of
cheerfulness
to
enjoy
every
day
as
we
go
along
not
to
fret
and
stew
all
the
week
and
then
expect
to
make
up
for
it
sunday
or
on
some
holiday
it
is
not
a
question
of
mirth
so
much
as
of
cheerfulness
not
alone
that
which
accompanies
laughter
but
serenity
a
calm
sweet
and
inward
peace
are
there
not
multitudes
of
people
who
have
the
blues
who
yet
wish
well
to
their
neighbors
they
would
say
kind
words
and
make
the
world
happier
but
they
have
the
time
to
lead
them
to
look
on
the
sunny
side
of
things
and
to
take
a
little
time
every
day
to
speak
pleasant
words
is
the
message
of
the
hour

author

the
preparation
of

what
vanderbilt
paid
for

william
vanderbilt
when
he
last
visited
constantinople
one
day
invited
coquelin
the
elder
so
celebrated
for
his
powers
as
a
mimic
who
happened
to
be
in
the
city
at
the
time
to
give
a
private
recital
on
board
his
yacht
lying
in
the
bosphorus
coquelin
spoke
three
of
his
monologues
a
few
days
afterwards
coquelin
received
the
following
memorandum
from
the
millionaire
you
have
brought
tears
to
our
eyes
and
laughter
to
our
hearts
since
all
philosophers
are
agreed
that
laughing
is
preferable
to
weeping
your
account
with
me
stands
thus
for
tears
six
times
for
laughter
twelve
times
kindly
acknowledge
receipt
of
enclosed
check
i
find
nonsense
singularly
refreshing
said
talleyrand
there
is
good
philosophy
in
the
saying
laugh
and
grow
fat
if
everybody
knew
the
power
of
laughter
as
a
health
tonic
and
life
prolonger
the
tinge
of
sadness
which
now
clouds
the
american
face
would
largely
disappear
and
many
physicians
would
find
their
occupation
gone
the
power
of
laughter
was
given
us
to
serve
a
wise
purpose
in
our
economy
it
is
nature
device
for
exercising
the
internal
organs
and
giving
us
pleasure
at
the
same
time
laughter
begins
in
the
lungs
and
diaphragm
setting
the
liver
stomach
and
other
internal
organs
into
a
quick
vibration
which
gives
a
pleasant
sensation
and
exercise
almost
equal
to
that
of
horseback
riding
during
digestion
the
movements
of
the
stomach
are
similar
to
churning
every
time
you
take
a
full
breath
or
when
you
cachinnate
well
the
diaphragm
descends
and
gives
the
stomach
an
extra
squeeze
and
shakes
it
frequent
laughing
sets
the
stomach
to
dancing
hurrying
up
the
digestive
process
the
heart
beats
faster
and
sends
the
blood
bounding
through
the
body
there
is
not
says
green
one
remotest
corner
or
little
inlet
of
the
minute
of
the
human
body
that
does
not
feel
some
wavelet
from
the
convulsions
occasioned
by
a
good
hearty
laugh
in
medical
terms
it
stimulates
the
vasomotor
centers
and
the
spasmodic
contraction
of
the
causes
the
blood
to
flow
quickly
laughter
accelerates
the
respiration
and
gives
warmth
and
glow
to
the
whole
system
it
brightens
the
eye
increases
the
perspiration
expands
the
chest
forces
the
poisoned
air
from
the
lung
cells
and
tends
to
restore
that
exquisite
poise
or
balance
which
we
call
health
which
results
from
the
harmonious
action
of
all
the
functions
of
the
body
this
delicate
poise
which
may
be
destroyed
by
a
sleepless
night
a
piece
of
bad
news
by
grief
or
anxiety
is
often
wholly
restored
by
a
good
hearty
laugh
there
is
therefore
sound
sense
in
the
caption
cheerfulness
as
a
life
power
relating
as
it
does
to
the
physical
life
as
well
as
the
mental
and
moral
and
what
we
may
call
the
laugh
cure
is
based
upon
principles
recognized
as
sound
by
the
medical
profession
so
literally
true
is
the
hebrew
proverb
that
a
merry
heart
doeth
good
like
a
medicine
mirth
is
god
medicine
said
oliver
wendell
holmes
everybody
ought
to
bathe
in
it
grim
care
moroseness
anxiety
all
the
rust
of
life
ought
to
be
scoured

burdick

known
as
the
laughing
doctor
he
always
presented
the
happiest
kind
of

his

was

dealt

the
most
eminent
medical
journal
in
the
world
gives
the
following
scientific
testimony
to
the
value
of
jovialty
this
power
of
spirits
is
a
matter
of
high
moment
to
the
sick
and
weakly
to
the
former
it
may
mean
the
ability
to
survive
to
the
latter
the
possibility
of
outliving
or
living
in
spite
of
a
disease
it
is
therefore
of
the
greatest
importance
to
cultivate
the
highest
and
most
buoyant
frame
of
mind
which
the
conditions
will
admit
the
same
energy
which
takes
the
form
of
mental
activity
is
vital
to
the
work
of
the
organism
mental
influences
affect
the
system
and
a
joyous
spirit
not
only
relieves
pain
but
increases
the
momentum
of
life
in
the
body
ray
superintendent
of
butler
hospital
for
the
insane
says
in
one
of
his
reports
a
hearty
laugh
is
more
desirable
for
mental
health
than
any
exercise
of
the
reasoning
faculties
grief
anxiety
and
fear
are
great
enemies
of
human
life
a
depressed
sour
melancholy
soul
a
life
which
has
ceased
to
believe
in
its
own
sacredness
its
own
power
its
own
mission
a
life
which
sinks
into
querulous
egotism
or
vegetating
aimlessness
has
become
crippled
and
useless
we
should
fight
against
every
influence
which
tends
to
depress
the
mind
as
we
would
against
a
temptation
to
crime
it
is
undoubtedly
true
that
as
a
rule
the
mind
has
power
to
lengthen
the
period
of
youthful
and
mature
strength
and
beauty
preserving
and
renewing
physical
life
by
a
stalwart
mental
health
i
read
the
other
day
of
a
man
in
a
neighboring
city
who
was
given
up
to
die
his
relatives
were
sent
for
and
they
watched
at
his
bedside
but
an
old
acquaintance
who
called
to
see
him
assured
him
smilingly
that
he
was
all
right
and
would
soon
be
well
he
talked
in
such
a
strain
that
the
sick
man
was
forced
to
laugh
and
the
effort
so
roused
his
system
that
he
rallied
and
he
was
soon
well
again
was
it
not
shakespere
who
said
that
a
light
heart
lives
long
the
san
francisco
argonaut
says
that
a
woman
in
milpites
a
victim
of
almost
crushing
sorrow
despondency
indigestion
insomnia
and
kindred
ills
determined
to
throw
off
the
gloom
which
was
making
life
so
heavy
a
burden
to
her
and
established
a
rule
that
she
would
laugh
at
least
three
times
a
day
whether
occasion
was
presented
or
not
so
she
trained
herself
to
laugh
heartily
at
the
least
provocation
and
would
retire
to
her
room
and
make
merry
by
herself
she
was
soon
in
excellent
health
and
buoyant
spirits
her
home
became
a
sunny
cheerful
abode
it
was
said
by
one
who
knew
this
woman
well
and
who
wrote
an
account
of
the
case
for
a
popular
magazine
that
at
first
her
husband
and
children
were
amused
at
her
and
while
they
respected
her
determination
because
of
the
griefs
she
bore
they
did
not
enter
into
the
spirit
of
the
plan
but
after
awhile
said
this
woman
to
me
with
a
smile
only
yesterday
the
funny
part
of
the
idea
struck
my
husband
and
he
began
to
laugh
every
time
we
spoke
of
it
and
when
he
came
home
he
would
ask
me
if
i
had
had
my
laughs
and
he
would
laugh
when
he
asked
the
question
and
again
when
i
answered
it
my
children
then
very
young
thought
notion
very
queer
but
they
laughed
at
it
just
the
same
gradually
my
children
told
other
children
and
they
told
their
parents
my
husband
spoke
of
it
to
our
friends
and
i
rarely
met
one
of
them
but
he
or
she
would
laugh
and
ask
me
many
of
your
laughs
have
you
had
naturally
they
laughed
when
they
asked
and
of
course
that
set
me
laughing
when
i
formed
this
apparently
strange
habit
i
was
weighed
down
with
sorrow
and
my
rule
simply
lifted
me
out
of
it
i
had
suffered
the
most
acute
indigestion
for
years
i
have
not
known
what
it
is
headaches
were
a
daily
dread
for
over
six
years
i
have
not
had
a
single
pain
in
the
head
my
home
seems
different
to
me
and
i
feel
a
thousand
times
more
interest
in
its
work
my
husband
is
a
changed
man
my
children
are
called
girls
who
are
always
laughing
and
altogether
my
rule
has
proved
an
inspiration
which
has
worked
wonders
the
queen
of
fashion
however
says
that
we
must
never
laugh
out
loud
but
since
the
same
tyrannical
mistress
kills
people
by
corsets
indulges
in
cosmetics
and
is
out
all
night
at
dancing
parties
and
in
china
pinches
up
the
women
feet
i
place
much
less
confidence
in
her
views
upon
the
laugh
cure
for
human
woes
yet
in
all
civilized
countries
it
is
a
fundamental
principle
of
refined
manners
not
to
be
and
unreasonably
noisy
and
boisterous
in
mirth
one
who
is
wise
will
never
violate
the
proprieties
of
people
yet
says
a
wholesome
writer
upon
health
we
should
do
something
more
than
to
simply
cultivate
a
cheerful
hopeful
spirit
we
should
cultivate
a
spirit
of
mirthfulness
that
is
not
only
easily
pleased
and
smiling
but
that
indulges
in
hearty
hilarious
laughter
and
if
this
faculty
is
not
well
marked
in
our
organization
we
should
cultivate
it
being
well
assured
that
hearty
laughter
will
do
us
good
ordinary
good
looks
depend
on
one
sense
of
humor
a
merry
heart
maketh
a
cheerful
countenance
joyfulness
keeps
the
heart
and
face
young
a
good
laugh
makes
us
better
friends
with
ourselves
and
everybody
around
us
and
puts
us
into
closer
touch
with
what
is
best
and
brightest
in
our
lot
in
life
physiology
tells
the
story
the
great
sympathetic
nerves
are
closely
allied
and
when
one
set
carries
bad
news
to
the
head
the
nerves
reaching
the
stomach
are
affected
indigestion
comes
on
and
countenance
becomes
doleful
laugh
when
you
can
it
is
a
cheap
medicine
merriment
is
a
philosophy

understood
the
eminent
surgeon
chavasse
says
that
we
ought
to
begin
with
the
babies
and
train
children
to
habits
of
mirth
encourage
your
child
to
be
merry
and
laugh
aloud
a
good
hearty
laugh
expands
the
chest
and
makes
the
blood
bound
merrily
along
commend
me
to
a
good
laugh
not
to
a
little
snickering
laugh
but
to
one
that
will
sound
right
through
the
house
it
will
not
only
do
your
child
good
but
will
be
a
benefit
to
all
who
hear
and
be
an
important
means
of
driving
the
blues
away
from
a
dwelling
merriment
is
very
catching
and
spreads
in
a
remarkable
manner
few
being
able
to
resist
its
contagion
a
hearty
laugh
is
delightful
harmony
indeed
it
is
the
best
of
all

the
cold
glitter

fewest
are
able
to
laugh
what
can
be
called
laughing
but
only
sniff
and
titter
and
snicker
from

throat
outward
or
at

produce
some
whiffing
husky
cachinnation
as
if

the
alpha
and
omega
of
american
life
there
is
no
pleasure
no
joy
no
satisfaction
there
is
no
standard
except
that
of
profit
there
is
no
other
country
where
they
speak
of
a
man
as
worth
so
many
dollars
in
other
countries
they
live
to
enjoy
life
here
they
exist
for
business
a
boston
merchant
corroborated
this
statement
by
saying
he
was
anxious
all
day
about
making
money
and
worried
all
night
for
fear
he
should
lose
what
he
had
made
in
the
united
states
a
distinguished
traveler
once
said
there
is
everywhere
comfort
but
no
joy
the
ambition
of
getting
more
and
fretting
over
what
is
lost
absorb
life
every
man
we
meet
looks
as
if
he
gone
out
to
borrow
trouble
with
plenty
of
it
on
hand
said
a
french
lady
upon
arriving
in
new
york
the
americans
are
the
the
and
the
people
in
the
world
says
another
witness
but
they
are
the
most
anxious
they
hug
possible
calamity
to
their
breasts
i
question
if
care
and
doubt
ever
wrote
their
names
so
legibly
on
the
faces
of
any
other
population
says
emerson
old
age
begins
in
the
nursery
how
quickly
we
americans
exhaust
life
with
what
panting
haste
we
pursue
everything
every
man
you
meet
seems
to
be
late
for
an
appointment
hurry
is
stamped
in
the
wrinkles
of
the
national
face
we
are
men
of
action
we
go
faster
and
faster
as
the
years
go
by
speeding
our
machinery
to
the
utmost
bent
forms
prematurely
gray
hair
restlessness
and
discontent
are
characteristic
of
our
age
and
people
we
earn
our
bread
but
can
not
digest
it
and
our
nerves
soon
become
irritated
and
touchiness
follows
so
fatal
to
a
business
man
and
so
annoying
in
society
it
is
not
work
that
kills
men
says
beecher
it
is
worry
work
is
healthy
you
can
hardly
put
more
on
a
man
than
he
can
bear
but
worry
is
rust
upon
the
blade
it
is
not
movement
that
destroys
the
machinery
but
friction
it
is
not
so
much
the
great
sorrows
the
great
burdens
the
great
hardships
the
great
calamities
that
cloud
over
the
sunshine
of
life
as
the
little
petty
vexations
insignificant
anxieties
and
fear
the
little
daily
dyings
which
render
our
lives
unhappy
and
destroy
our
mental
elasticity
without
advancing
our
one
inch
anxiety
never
yet
bridged
any
chasm
what
asks
george
jacoby
in
an
evening
post
interview
is
the
ultimate
physical
effect
of
worry
why
the
same
as
that
of
a
fatal
or
worry
kills
as
surely
though
not
so
quickly
as
ever
gun
or
dagger
did
and
more
people
have
died
in
the
last
century
from
sheer
worry
than
have
been
killed
in
battle
jacoby
is
one
of
the
foremost
of
american
brain
doctors
the
investigations
of
the
neurologists
he
says
have
laid
bare
no
secret
of
nature
in
recent
years
more
startling
and
interesting
than
the
discovery
that
worry
kills
this
is
the
final
word
not
only
is
it
known
resumes
the
great
neurologist
counting
off
his
words
as
it
were
on
his
that
worry
kills
but
the
most
minute
details
of
its
murderous
methods
are
familiar
to
modern
scientists
it
is
a
common
belief
of
those
who
have
made
a
special
study
of
the
science
of
brain
diseases
that
hundreds
of
deaths
attributed
to
other
causes
each
year
are
due
simply
to
worry
in
plain
untechnical
language
worry
works
its
irreparable
injury
through
certain
cells
of
the
brain
life
the
insidious
inroads
upon
the
system
can
be
best
likened
to
the
constant
falling
of
drops
of
water
in
one
spot
in
the
brain
it
is
the
insistent
idea
the
single
constant
thought
centered
upon
one
subject
which
in
the
course
of
time
destroys
the
brain
cells
the
healthy
brain
can
cope
with
occasional
worry
it
is
the
iteration
and
reiteration
of
disquieting
thoughts
which
the
cells
of
the
brain
can
not
successfully
combat
the
mechanical
effect
of
worry
is
much
the
same
as
if
the
skull
were
laid
bare
and
the
brain
exposed
to
the
action
of
a
little
hammer
beating
continually
upon
it
day
after
day
until
the
membranes
are
disintegrated
and
the
normal
functions
disabled
the
maddening
thought
that
will
not
be
downed
the
haunting
idea
that
is
not
or
can
not
be
banished
by
a
supreme
effort
of
the
will
is
the
theoretical
hammer
which
diminishes
the
vitality
of
the
sensitive
nerve
organisms
the
minuteness
of
which
makes
them
visible
to
the
eye
only
under
a
powerful
microscope
the
the
thought
the
single
idea
grows
upon
one
as
time
goes
on
until
the
worry
victim
can
not
throw
it
off
through
this
one
set
or
area
of
cells
is
affected
the
cells
are
intimately
connected
joined
together
by
little
fibres
and
they
in
turn
are
in
close
relationship
with
the
cells
of
the
other
parts
of
the
brain
worry
is
itself
a
species
of
monomania
no
mental
attitude
is
more
disastrous
to
personal
achievement
personal
happiness
and
personal
usefulness
in
the
world
than
worry
and
its
twin
brother
despondency
the
remedy
for
the
evil
lies
in
training
the
will
to
cast
off
cares
and
seek
a
change
of
occupation
when
the
first
warning
is
sounded
by
nature
in
intellectual
lassitude
relaxation
is
the
certain
foe
of
worry
and
fret
one
of
the
healthiest
of
maxims
in
a
life
of
constant
worrying
we
are
as
much
behind
the
times
as
if
we
were
to
go
back
to
use
the
first
steam
engines
that
wasted
ninety
per
cent
of
the
energy
of
the
coal
instead
of
having
an
electric
dynamo
that
utilizes
ninety
per
cent
of
the
power
some
people
waste
a
large
percentage
of
their
energy
in
fretting
and
stewing
in
useless
anxiety
in
scolding
in
complaining
about
the
weather
and
the
perversity
of
inanimate
things
others
convert
nearly
all
of
their
energy
into
power
and
moral
sunshine
he
who
has
learned
the
true
art
of
living
will
not
waste
his
energies
in
friction
which
accomplishes
nothing
but
merely
grinds
out
the
machinery
of
life
it
must
be
relegated
to
the
debating
societies
to
determine
which
is
the
worse
a
nervous
man
or
a
worrying
woman
i
awfully
worried
this
morning
said
one
woman
what
is
it
why
i
thought
of
something
to
worry
about
last
night
and
now
i
remember
it
a
famous
actress
once
said
worry
is
the
foe
of
all
beauty
she
might
have
added
it
is
the
foe
to
all
health
it
seems
so
heartless
in
me
if
i
do
not
worry
about
my
children
said
one
mother
women
nurse
their
troubles
as
they
do
their
babies
troubles
grow
larger
said
lady
holland
by
nursing
the
white
knight
who
carried
about
a
mousetrap
lest
he
be
troubled
with
mice
upon
his
journeys
was
not
unlike
those
who
anticipate
their
burdens
he
grieves
says
seneca
more
than
is
necessary
who
grieves
before
it
is
necessary
my
children
said
a
dying
man
during
my
long
life
i
have
had
a
great
many
troubles
most
of
which
never
happened
a
prominent
business
man
in
philadelphia
said
that
his
father
worried
for
years
over
an
anticipated
misfortune
which
never
arrived
we
try
to
grasp
too
much
of
life
at
once
since
we
think
of
it
as
a
whole
instead
of
living
one
day
at
a
time
life
is
a
mosaic
and
each
tiny
piece
must
be
cut
and
set
with
skill
first
one
piece
then
another
a
clock
would
be
of
no
use
as
a
if
it
should
become
discouraged
and
come
to
a
standstill
by
calculating
its
work
a
year
ahead
as
the
clock
did
in
jane
taylor
fable
it
is
not
the
troubles
of
but
those
of
and
next
week
and
next
year
that
whiten
our
heads
wrinkle
our
faces
and
bring
us
to
a
standstill
there
is
such
a
thing
said
uncle
eben
as
too
much
foresight
people
get
to
figuring
what
might
happen
year
after
next
and
let
the
fire
go
out
and
catch
their
death
of
cold
right
where
they
are
nervous
prostration
is
seldom
the
result
of
present
trouble
or
work
but
of
work
and
trouble
anticipated
mental
exhaustion
comes
to
those
who
look
ahead
and
climb
mountains
before
reaching
them
resolutely
build
a
wall
about
and
live
within
the
inclosure
the
past
may
have
been
hard
sad
or
wrong
but
it
is
over
why
not
take
a
turn
about
instead
of
worrying
over
unforeseen
misfortune
set
out
with
all
your
soul
to
rejoice
in
the
unforeseen
blessings
of
all
your
coming
days
i
find
the
gayest
castles
in
the
air
that
were
ever
piled
says
emerson
far
better
for
comfort
and
for
use
than
the
dungeons
in
the
air
that
are
daily
dug
and
caverned
out
by
grumbling
discontented
people
what
is
this
world
but
as
you
take
it
thackeray
calls
the
world
a
that
gives
back
the
reflection
of
one
own
face
frown
at
it
and
it
will
look
sourly
upon
you
laugh
at
it
and
it
is
a
jolly
companion
there
is
no
use
in
talking
said
a
woman
every
time
i
move
i
vow
i
never
move
again
such
neighbors
as
i
get
in
with
seems
as
though
they
grow
worse
and
worse
indeed
replied
her
caller
perhaps
you
take
the
worst
neighbor
with
you
when
you
move
in
the
sudden
of
independence
day
says
a
news
correspondent
we
were
struck
by
the
contrast
between
two
women
each
of
whom
had
had
some
trying
experience
with
the
weather
one
came
through
the
rain
and
hail
to
take
refuge
at
the
railway
station
under
the
swaying
and
uncertain
shelter
of
an
escorting
man
umbrella
her
skirts
were
soaked
to
the
knees
her
pink
ribbons
were
limp
the
purple
of
the
flowers
on
her
hat
ran
in
streaks
down
the
white
silk
and
yet
though
she
was
a
poor
girl
and
her
holiday
finery
must
have
been
relatively
costly
she
made
the
best
of
it
with
a
smile
and
cheerful
words
the
other
was
well
sheltered
but
she
took
the
disappointment
of
her
hopes
and
the
possibility
of
a
little
spattering
from
a
leaky
window
with
frowns
and
cries
little
miss
fret
in
a
very
great
pet
hate
this
warm
weather
it
horrid
to
tan
it
scorches
my
nose
and
it
blisters
my
toes
and
wherever
i
go
i
must
carry
a
fan
chirps
little
miss
laugh
i
could
tell
half
the
fun
i
am
having
this
bright
summer
day
i
sing
through
the
hours
i
cull
pretty
flowers
and
ride
like
a
queen
on
the
hay
happily
a
new
era
has
of
late
opened
for
our
worried
housekeepers
who
spend
their
time
in
the
dusting
of
corners
spasmodic
sweeping
impatient
snatching
or
pushing
aside
obstacles
in
the
room
hurrying
and
skurrying
upstairs
and
down
cellar
it
is
not
says
prentice
mulford
the
work
that
exhausts
them
it
is
the
mental
condition
they
are
in
that
makes
so
many
old
and
haggard
at
forty
all
that
is
needful
now
to
ease
up
their
burdens
is
to
go
to
our
hawaiian
paradise
a
newspaper
correspondent
annie
laurie
has
told
us
all
about
the
new
kind
of
american
girls
just
added
to
our
country
they
are
as
straight
as
an
arrow
and
walk
as
queens
walk
in
fairy
stories
they
have
great
braids
of
sleek
black
hair
soft
brown
eyes
and
gleaming
white
teeth
they
can
swim
and
ride
and
sing
and
they
are
brown
with
a
skin
that
shines
like
bronze
there
is
a
worried
woman
in
hawaii
the
women
there
ca
worry
they
do
know
how
they
eat
and
sing
and
laugh
and
see
the
sun
and
the
moon
set
and
possess
their
souls
in
smiling
peace
if
a
hawaii
woman
has
a
good
dinner
she
laughs
and
invites
her
friends
to
eat
it
with
her
if
she
has
a
good
dinner
she
laughs
and
goes
to
sleep
and
forgets
to
be
hungry
she
does
have
to
worry
about
what
the
people
in
the
downstairs
flat
will
think
if
they
do
see
the
butcher
boy
arrive
on
time
if
she
can
earn
the
money
she
buys
a
nice
new
glorified
mother
hubbard
and
if
she
ca
get
it
she
throws
the
old
one
into
the
surf
and
washes
it
out
puts
a
new
wreath
of
fresh
flowers
in
her
hair
and
starts
out
to
enjoy
the
morning
and
the
breezes
thereof
they
are
not
earnest
workers
they
have
the
slightest
idea
that
they
were
put
upon
earth
to
reform
the
universe
they
just
happy
they
run
across
great
stretches
of
clear
white
sand
washed
with
resplendent
purple
waves
and
when
the
little
brown
babies
roll
in
the
surf
their
brown
mothers
run
after
them
laughing
and
splashing
like
a
lot
of
children
or
perhaps
we
see
them
in
gay
cavalcades
mounted
upon
garlanded
ponies
adorned
by
white
jasmine
wreaths
with
roses
and
pinks
and
here
in
this
paradise
of
laughter
and
light
hearts
and
gentle
music
there
absolutely
nothing
to
do
but
to
care
for
the
children
and
old
people
and
to
swim
or
ride
you
could
start
a
circle
to
save
your
life
there
is
a
jail
in
the
place
nor
a
tenement
quarter
and
there
are
no
outdoor
poor
there
is
a
woman
club
in
honolulu
not
a
club
there
was
a
culture
circle
once
for
a
few
days
a
boston
woman
who
went
there
for
her
health
organized
it
but
it
interfered
with
afternoon
so
nobody
came
when
hereafter
we
talk
about
worrying
women
we
must
take
into
account
our
hawaiian
sisters
if
we
will
average
up
the
amount
of
worry
in
our
nation
a
weather
breeder
it
is
probably
quite
within
bounds
to
say
that
one
out
of
three
of
our
american
farming
population
women
and
men
never
enjoy
a
beautiful
day
without
first
reminding
you
that
it
is
one
of
those
infernal
weather
breeders
habitual
fretters
see
more
trouble
than
others
they
are
never
so
well
as
their
neighbors
the
weather
never
suits
them
the
climate
is
trying
the
winds
are
too
high
or
too
low
it
is
too
hot
or
too
cold
too
damp
or
too
dry
the
roads
are
either
muddy
or
dusty
i
met
one
wet
morning
says
john
todd
and
bound
as
i
was
to
make
the
best
of
it
i
ventured
morning
this
rain
will
be
fine
for
your
grass
crop
perhaps
he
replied
it
is
very
bad
for
corn
i
do
think
we
have
half
a
crop
a
few
days
later
i
met
him
again
is
a
fine
sun
for
corn
said
he
it
awful
for
rye
rye
wants
cold
weather
one
cool
morning
soon
after
i
said
is
a
capital
day
for
rye
he
said
it
is
the
worst
kind
of
weather
for
corn
and
grass
they
want
heat
to
bring
them
forward
there
are
a
vast
number
of
fidgety
nervous
and
eccentric
people
who
live
only
to
expect
new
disappointments
or
to
recount
their
old
ones
impatient
people
said
spurgeon
water
their
miseries
and
hoe
up
their
comforts
let
see
said
a
neighbor
to
a
farmer
whose
wagon
was
loaded
down
with
potatoes
were
we
talking
together
last
august
i
believe
so
at
that
time
you
said
corn
was
all
burnt
up
yes
and
potatoes
were
baking
in
the
ground
yes
and
that
your
district
could
not
possibly
expect
more
than
half
a
crop
i
remember
well
here
you
are
with
your
wagon
loaded
down
things
did
turn
out
so
badly
after
all
eh
well
said
the
farmer
as
he
raked
his
fingers
through
his
hair
but
i
tell
you
my
geese
suffered
awfully
for
want
of
a
to
paddle
in
what
is
a
pessimist
but
a
man
who
looks
on
the
sun
only
as
a
thing
that
casts
a
shadow
in
pepys
diary
we
learn
the
difference
between
eyes
shut
and
ears
open
and
ears
shut
and
eyes
open
in
going
from
john
o
house
to
land
end
a
blind
man
would
hear
that
the
country
was
going
to
destruction
but
a
deaf
man
with
eyes
open
could
see
great
prosperity
i
dare
no
more
fret
than
curse
or
swear
said
john
wesley
a
discontented
mortal
is
no
more
a
man
than
discord
is

why
should
a
man
whose
blood
is
warm
within
sit
like
his
grandsire
cut
in
alabaster
sleep
when
he
wakes
and
creep
into
the
jaundice
by
being
peevish
who
are
the
lemon
squeezers
of
society
they
are
people
who
predict
evil
extinguish
hope
and
see
only
the
worst
side
people
whose
very
look
curdles
the
milk
and
sets
your
teeth
on
edge
they
are
often
worthy
people
who
think
that
pleasure
is
wrong
people
said
an
old
divine
who
lead
us
heavenward
and
stick
pins
into
us
all
the
way
they
say
depressing
things
and
do
disheartening
things
they
chill
discourage
charitable
institutions
injure
commerce
and
kill
churches
they
are
blowing
out
lights
when
they
ought
to
be
kindling
them
a
man
without
mirth
is
like
a
wagon
without
springs
in
which
one
jolts
over
every
pebble
with
mirth
he
is
like
a
chariot
with
springs
riding
over
the
roughest
roads
and
scarcely
feeling
anything
but
a
pleasant
rocking
motion
difficulties
melt
away
before
the
man
who
carries
about
a
cheerful
spirit
and
persistently
refuses
to
be
discouraged
while
they
accumulate
before
the
one
who
is
always
groaning
over
his
hard
luck
and
scanning
the
horizon
for
clouds
not
yet
in
sight
to
one
man
says
schopenhauer
the
world
is
barren
dull
and
superficial
to
another
rich
interesting
and
full
of
meaning
if
one
loves
beauty
and
looks
for
it
he
will
see
it
wherever
he
goes
if
there
is
music
in
his
soul
he
will
hear
it
everywhere
every
object
in
nature
will
sing
to
him
two
men
who
live
in
the
same
house
and
do
the
same
work
may
not
live
in
the
same
world
although
they
are
under
the
same
roof
one
may
see
only
deformity
and
ugliness
to
him
the
world
is
out
of
joint
everything
is
and
out
of
sorts
the
other
is
surrounded
with
beauty
and
harmony
everybody
is
kind
to
him
nobody
wishes
him
harm
these
men
see
the
same
objects
but
they
do
not
look
through
the
same
glasses
one
looks
through
a
smoked
glass
which
drapes
the
whole
world
in
mourning
the
other
looks
through
lenses
which
tint
everything
with
loveliness
and
touch
it
with
beauty
take
two
persons
just
home
from
a
vacation
one
has
positively
seen
nothing
and
has
always
been
robbed
the
landlady
was
a
harpy
the
bedroom
was
unhealthy
and
the
mutton
was
tough
the
other
has
always
found
the
coziest
nooks
the
cheapest
houses
the
best
landladies
the
finest
views
and
the
best
dinners
what
is
an
optimist
this
is
the
question
a
farmer
boy
asked
of
his
father
well
john
replied
his
father
you
know
i
ca
give
ye
the
dictionary
meanin
of
that
word
any
more
i
can
of
a
great
many
others
but
i
got
a
kind
of
an
idee
what
it
means
probably
you
remember
your
uncle
henry
but
i
guess
if
there
ever
was
an
optimist
he
was
one
things
was
always
comin
out
right
with
henry
and
especially
anything
hard
that
he
had
to
do
it
wa
to
be
hard
was
jest
kind
of
take
hoein
corn
now
if
anything
ever
tuckered
me
out
was
corn
in
the
hot
sun
but
in
the
field
about
the
time
i
begun
to
lag
back
a
little
henry
he
look
up
an
say
jim
when
we
get
these
two
rows
hoed
an
eighteen
more
the
piece
be
half
done
an
he
say
it
in
such
a
kind
of
a
cheerful
way
that
i
could
ben
any
more
tickled
if
the
piece
had
been
all
done
an
the
rest
would
go
light
enough
but
the
worst
thing
we
had
to
do
hoein
corn
was
a
picnic
to
it
was
pickin
stones
there
was
no
end
to
that
on
our
old
farm
if
we
wanted
to
raise
anything
when
we
hurried
and
pressed
with
else
there
was
always
pickin
stones
to
do
and
there
a
but
what
brought
up
a
fresh
crop
an
seems
as
if
the
pickin
had
all
to
be
done
over
again
well
you
a
thought
to
hear
henry
that
there
any
fun
in
the
world
like
pickin
stones
he
looked
at
it
in
a
different
way
from
anybody
i
ever
see
once
when
the
corn
was
all
hoed
and
the
grass
fit
to
cut
yet
an
i
got
all
laid
out
to
go
fishin
and
father
he
up
and
set
us
to
pickin
stones
up
on
the
west
piece
an
i
was
about
ready
to
cry
henry
he
says
on
jim
i
know
where
there
lots
of
nuggets
an
what
do
you
now
that
boy
had
a
kind
of
a
game
that
that
there
field
was
what
he
called
a
plasser
mining
field
and
he
got
me
into
it
and
i
could
sworn
i
was
in
californy
all
day
i
had
such
a
good
time
says
henry
after
we
got
through
the
day
work
way
you
get
rich
with
these
nuggets
is
to
get
rid
of
instead
of
to
get
that
somehow
did
strike
my
fancy
but
we
had
play
instead
of
work
anyway
an
a
great
lot
of
stones
had
been
rooted
out
of
that
field
an
as
i
said
before
i
ca
give
ye
any
dictionary
definition
of
optimism
but
if
your
uncle
henry
an
optimist
i
do
know
what
one
is
at
life
outset
says
one
a
cheerful
optimistic
temperament
is
worth
everything
a
cheerful
man
who
always
feels
who
always
looks
on
the
bright
side
who
is
ever
ready
to
snatch
victory
from
defeat
is
the
successful
man
everybody
avoids
the
company
of
those
who
are
always
grumbling
who
are
full
of
ifs
and
buts
and
i
told
you
so
we
like
the
man
who
always
looks
toward
the
sun
whether
it
shines
or
not
it
is
the
cheerful
hopeful
man
we
go
to
for
sympathy
and
assistance
not
the
carping
gloomy
critic
who
always
thinks
it
is
going
to
rain
and
that
we
are
going
to
have
a
terribly
hot
summer
or
a
fearful
or
who
is
forever
complaining
of
hard
times
and
his
hard
lot
it
is
the
bright
cheerful
hopeful
contented
man
who
makes
his
way
who
is
respected
and
admired
gloom
and
depression
not
only
take
much
out
of
life
but
detract
greatly
from
the
chances
of
winning
success
it
is
the
bright
and
cheerful
spirit
that
wins
the
final
triumph
living
up
thanksgiving
avenue
i
see
our
brother
who
has
just
sat
down
lives
on
grumbling
street
said
a
yorkshireman
i
lived
there
myself
for
some
time
and
never
enjoyed
good
health
the
air
was
bad
the
house
bad
the
water
bad
the
birds
never
came
and
sang
in
the
street
and
i
was
gloomy
and
sad
enough
but
i
i
got
into
thanksgiving
avenue
and
ever
since
then
i
have
had
good
health
and
so
have
all
my
family
the
air
is
pure
the
house
good
the
sun
shines
on
it
all
day
the
birds
are
always
singing
and
i
am
happy
as
i
can
live
now
i
recommend
our
brother
to
there
are
plenty
of
houses
to
let
on
thanksgiving
avenue
and
he
will
find
himself
a
new
man
if
he
will
only
come
and
i
shall
be
right
glad
to
have
him
for
a
neighbor
this
world
was
not
intended
for
a
vale
of
tears
but
as
a
sweet
vale

content
travelers
are
told
by
the
icelanders
who
live
amid
the
cold
and
desolation
of
almost
perpetual
winter
that
iceland
is
the
best
land

blithe

of

amid

glorious

of

the

have
a
dozen
words
for

when
a
persian
king
was

he
peddles
needles
and
thread
buttons
and
supplies
about
the
streets
of
boston
from

minot
j
savage
used
to
pity
this
man
very
much
and
once
in
venturing
to
talk
with
him
about
his
condition
he
was
utterly
amazed
to
find
that
the
man
was
perfectly
happy
he
said
that
he
had
a
faithful
wife
and
a
business
by
which
he
earned
sufficient
for
his
wants
and
if
he
were
to
complain
of
his
lot
he
should
feel
mean
and
contemptible
surely
if
there
are
any
solid
men
in
boston
he
is

according

business

we
often
say
that
cotton
is
king
or
corn
is
king
but
with
greater
propriety
we
may
say
that
the
king
is
that
great

is

inciting
the
actions
of
men
what
has
most
at
its
disposal
the
condition
and
destinies
of
the
world
we
must
answer
at
once
it
is
business
in
its

the
most

john

clerks
have
been

to

we
can
work

for
a
week
after

morning
from
mr

this
kindly
disposition
and
cheerful
manner
and
a
desire
to
create
a
pleasant
feeling

diffuse
good
cheer

who
work

had
a
great

who
easily
finds
fault

is

who
never
commends
the
work
of
subordinates
when
he
can
do
so
justly
who

fails
to
secure
the

why
not
try

way
it
will
pay
better
and
be
better
a
habit
of
cheerfulness
enabling
one
to
transmute
apparent
misfortunes
into
real
blessings
is
a
fortune
to
a
young
man
or
young
woman
just
crossing
the
threshold
of
active
life
there
is
nothing
but
ill
fortune
in
a
habit
of
grumbling
which
requires
no
talent
no
no
brains
no
character
grumbling
only
makes
an
employee
more
uncomfortable
and
may
cause
his
dismissal
no
one
would
or
should
wish
to
make
him
do
grudgingly
what
so
many
others
would
be
glad
to
do
in
a
cheerful
spirit
if
you
dislike
your

no

express
yourself
in

as
freely
as
you

for
it
is
the
only
way
that
will
count
no
one
ever
found
the
world
quite
as
he
would
like
it
you
will
be
sure
to
have
burdens
laid
upon
you
that
belong
to
other
people
unless
you
are
a
shirk
yourself
but
do
grumble
if
the
work
needs
doing
and
you
can
do
it
never
mind
about
the
other
one
who
ought
to
have
done
it
and
did
do
it
yourself
those
workers
who
fill
up
the
gaps
and
smooth
away
the
rough
spots
and
finish
up
the
jobs
that
others
leave
undone
they
are
the
true
peacemakers
and
worth
a
regiment
of
grumblers
oh
what
a
sunny
winsome
face
she
has
said
a
christian
endeavorer
in
reporting
of
a
clerk
whom
he
saw
in
a
bay
city
store
the
customers
flocked
about
her
like
bees
about
a
in
full
bloom
singing
at
your
work
give
us
therefore
let
us
cry
with
carlyle
oh
give
us
the
man
who
sings
at
his
work
he
will
do
more
in
the
same
time
he
will
do
it
better
he
will
persevere
longer
one
is
scarcely
sensible
of
fatigue
whilst
he
marches
to
music
the
very
stars
are
said
to
make
harmony
as
they
revolve
in
their
spheres
wondrous
is
the
strength
of
cheerfulness
altogether
past
calculation
its
powers
of
endurance
efforts
to
be
permanently
useful
must
be
uniformly
joyous
a
spirit
all
sunshine
graceful
from
very
gladness
beautiful
because
bright
it
is
a
good
sign
says
another
writer
when
girlish
voices
carol
over
the
steaming
or
the
when
the
broom
moves
rhythmically
and
the
duster
flourishes
in
time
to
some
brisk
melody
we
are
sure
that
the
dishes
shine
more
brightly
and
that
the
sweeping
and
dusting
and
mending
are
more
satisfactory
because
of
this
running
accompaniment
of
song

when
he
hears

without
realizing
it
perhaps
catch
the
spirit
of
the
cheerful
worker
there
are
singing
milkers
in
switzerland
a
milkmaid
or
man
gets
better
wages
if
gifted
with
a
good
voice
for
a
cow
will
yield
more
milk
when
soothed
by
a
pleasing
melody
it
was
said
by
buffon
that
even
sheep
fatten
better
to
the
sound
of
music
and
when
are
singing
as
you
sometimes
hear
them
in
the
old
country
you
may
be
sure
the
labor
is
lightened
it
is
howitt
who
has
told
us
of
the
musical
bells
of
the
farm
teams
in
a
rural
district
in
england
it
was
no
regular
tune
but
a
delicious
melody
in
that
soft
sunshiny
air
which
was
filled
at
the
same
time
with
the
song
of
birds
angela
had
heard
all
kinds
of
music
in
london
but
this
was
unlike
anything
she
had
heard
before
so
soft
and
sweet
and
gladsome
on
it
came
ringing
ringing
as
softly
as
flowing
water
the
boys
and
grandfather
knew
what
it
meant
then
it
came
in
sight
the
farm
team
going
to
the
mill
with
sacks
of
corn
to
be
ground
each
horse
with
a
little
string
of
bells
to
its
harness

the

creatures
nodding
their

and

asked
angela
no
means
replied
her
grandfather
cost
something
but
if
we
can
make
labor
easier
to
a
horse
by
giving
him
a
little
music
which
he
loves
he
is
less
worn
by
his
work
and
that
is
a
saving
worth
thinking
of
a
horse
is
a
generous
animal
and
not
without
intellect
either
and
he
is
capable
of
much
enjoyment
from
music
a
spirit
of
song
if
not
the
singing
itself
is
a
constant
delight
to
us
it
is
like
passing
sweet
meadows
alive
with
bobolinks
some
men
says
beecher
move
through
life
as
a
band
of
music
moves
down
the
street
flinging
out
pleasures
on
every
side
through
the
air
to
every
one
far
and
near
who
can
listen
others
fill
the
air
with
harsh
clang
and
clangor
many
men
go
through
life
carrying
their
tongue
their
temper
their
whole
disposition
so
that
wherever
they
go
others
dread
them
some
men
fill
the
air
with
their
presence
and
sweetness
as
orchards
in
october
days
fill
the
air
with
the
perfume
of
ripe
fruit

health

are
to

the
late
charles
dana
fairly
bubbled
over
with
the
enjoyment
of
his
work
and
was
up
to
his
last
illness
at
his
office
every
day
a
cabinet
officer
once
said
to
him
well
dana
i
do
see
how
you
stand
this
infernal
grind
grind
said
dana
you
never
were
more
mistaken
i
have
nothing
but
fun
bully
was
a
favorite
word
with
him
a
slang
word
used
to
express
uncommon
pleasure
such
as
had
been
afforded
by
a
trip
abroad
or
by
a
run
to
cuba
or
mexico
or
by
the
perusal
of
something
especially
pleasing
in
the
sun
columns
one
of
my
neighbors
is
a
very
man
said
nathan
rothschild
he
tries
to
vex
me
and
has
built
a
great
place
for
swine
close
to
my
walk
so
when
i
go
out
i
hear
first
grunt
then
squeak
but
this
does
me
no
harm
i
am
always
in
good
humor
offended
by
a
pungent
article
a
gentleman
called
at
the
tribune
office
and
inquired
for
the
editor
he
was
shown
into
a
little
sanctum
where
greeley
sat
with
his
head
close
down
to
his
paper
scribbling
away
at
a
rate
the
angry
man
began
by
asking
if
this
was
greeley
yes
sir
what
do
you
want
said
the
editor
quickly
without
once
looking
up
from
his
paper
the
irate
visitor
then
began
using
his
tongue
with
no
reference
to
the
rules
of
propriety
good
breeding
or
reason
meantime
greeley
continued
to
write
page
after
page
was
dashed
off
in
the
most
impetuous
style
with
no
change
of
features
and
without
paying
the
slightest
attention
to
the
visitor
finally
after
about
twenty
minutes
of
the
most
impassioned
scolding
ever
poured
out
in
an
editor
office
the
angry
man
became
disgusted
and
abruptly
turned
to
walk
out
of
the
room
then
for
the
first
time
greeley
quickly
looked
up
rose
from
his
chair
and
slapping
the
gentleman
familiarly
on
his
shoulder
in
a
pleasant
tone
of
voice
said
do
go
friend
sit
down
sit
down
and
free
your
mind
it
will
do
you
good
you
will
feel
better
for
it
besides
it
helps
me
to
think
what
i
am
to
write
about
do
go
one
good
hearty
laugh
says
talmage
is
like
a
exploding
in
the
right
place
and
spleen
and
discontent
like
a
gun
that
kicks
over
the
man
shooting
it
off
every
one
says
lubbock
likes
a
man
who
can
enjoy
a
laugh
at
his
own
expense
and
justly
so
for
it
shows
good
humor
and
good
sense
if
you
laugh
at
yourself
other
people
will
not
laugh
at
you
people
differ
very
much
in
their
sense
of
humor
as
some
are
deaf
to
certain
sounds
and
blind
to
certain
colors
so
there
are
those
who
seem
deaf
and
blind
to
certain
pleasures
what
makes
me
laugh
until
i
almost
go
into
convulsions
moves
them
not
at
all
is
it
not
worth
while
to
make
an
effort
to
see
the
funny
side
of
our
petty
annoyances
how
could
the
two
boys
but
laugh
after
they
had
contended
long
over
the
possession
of
a
box
found
by
the
wayside
when
they
agreed
to
divide
its
contents
and
found
nothing
in
it
the
ability
to
get
on
with
scolding
irritating
people
is
a
great
art
in
doing
business
to
preserve
serenity
amid
petty
trials
is
a
happy
gift
a
sunny
temper
is
also
conducive
to
health
a
medical
authority
of
highest
repute
affirms
that
excessive
labor
exposure
to
wet
and
cold
deprivation
of
sufficient
quantities
of
necessary
and
wholesome
food
habitual
bad
lodging
sloth
and
intemperance
are
all
deadly
enemies
to
human
life
but
they
are
none
of
them
so
bad
as
violent
and
ungoverned
passions
that
men
and
women
have
frequently
lived
to
an
advanced
age
in
spite
of
these
but
that
instances
are
very
rare
in
which
people
of
irascible
tempers
live
to
extreme
old
age
poultney
bigelow
in
harper
magazine
in
relating
the
story
of
jameson
raid
upon
the
boers
of
south
africa
says
that
the
triumphant
boers
fell
on
their
knees
thanking
god
for
their
victory
and
that
they
prayed
for
their
enemies
and
treated
their
prisoners
with
the
utmost
kindness
our
foreign
missionary
books
relate
similar
anecdotes
it
being
a
characteristic
feature
of
their
childlike
piety
for
new
converts
to
take
literally
the
words
of
our
lord
love
your
enemies
it
is
not
true
that
the
devil
has
his
tail
in
everything
a
stalwart
confidence
in
god
and
faith
in
the
happy
outcome
of
life
will
do
more
to
lubricate
the
creaking
machinery
of
our
daily
affairs
than
anything
else

which
was
such
cheering

that

ran

cooke
many
times
a
millionaire
at
the
age
of
at
practically
penniless
went
to
work
again
and
built
another
fortune
the
last
of
his
three
thousand
creditors
was
paid
and
the
promise
of
the
great
financier
was
fulfilled
to
a
visitor
who
once
asked
him
how
he
regained

cooke
replied
that
is
simple
enough
by
never
changing
the
temperament
i
derived
from
my
father
and
mother
from
my
earliest
experience
in
life
i
have
always
been
of
a
hopeful
temperament
never
living
in
a
cloud
i
have
always
had
a
reasonable
philosophy
to
think
that
men
and
times
are
better
than
harsh
criticism
would
suppose
i
believed
that
this
american
world
of
ours
is
full
of
wealth
and
that
it
was
only
necessary
to
go
to
work
and
find
it
that
is
the
secret
of
my
success
in
life
always
look
on
the
sunny
side
everything
has
gone
said
a
new
york
business
man
in
despair
when
he
reached
home
but
when
he
came
to
himself
he
found
that
his
wife
and
his
children
and
the
promises
of
god
were
left
to
him
suffering
it
was
said
by
aristotle
becomes
beautiful
when
any
one
bears
great
calamities
with
cheerfulness
not
through
insensibility
but
through
greatness
of
mind
when
garrison
was
locked
up
in
the
boston
city
jail
he
said
he
had
two
delightful
companions
a
good
conscience
and
a
cheerful
mind
to
live
as
always
seeing
the
invisible
source
of
things
is
the
blessedest
state
of
being
for
the
quietude
it
brings
away
with
those
fellows
who
go
howling
through
life
wrote
beccher
and
all
the
while
passing
for
birds
of
paradise
he
that
can
not

and
be
gay

look
to
himself
he
should
fast

martin
luther
has
told
us
that
he
was
once
sorely
discouraged
and
vexed
at
himself
the
world
and
the
church
and
at
the
small
success
he
then
seemed
to
be
having
and
he
fell
into
a
despondency
which
affected
all
his
household
his
good
wife
could
not
charm
it
away
by
cheerful
speech
or
acts
at
length
she
hit
upon
this
happy
device
which
proved
effectual
she
appeared
before
him
in
deep
mourning
who
is
dead
asked
luther
oh
do
you
not
know
martin
god
in
heaven
is
dead
how
can
you
talk
such
nonsense
käthe
how
can
god
die
why
he
is
immortal
and
will
live
through
all
eternity
is
that
really
true
persisted
she
as
if
she
could
hardly
credit
his
assertion
that
god
still
lived
how
can
you
doubt
it
so
surely
as
there
is
a
god
in
heaven
asserted
the
aroused
theologian
so
sure
is
it
that
he
can
never
die
and
yet
said
she
demurely
in
a
tone
which
made
him
look
up
at
her
though
you
do
not
doubt
there
is
a
god
you
become
hopeless
and
discouraged
as
if
there
were
none
it
seemed
to
me
you
acted
as
if
god
were
dead
the
spell
was
broken
luther
heartily
laughed
at
his
wife
lesson
and
her
ingenious
way
of
presenting
it
i
observed
he
remarked
what
a
wise
woman
my
wife
was
who
mastered
my
sadness
jean
paul
richter
dream
of
no
god
is
one
of
the
most
somber
things
in
all
literature
tempestuous
chaos
no
healing
hand
no
infinite
father
i
awoke
my
soul
wept
for
joy
that
it
could
again
worship
the
infinite
father
and
when
i
arose
from
all
nature
i
heard
flowing
sweet
peaceful
tones
as
from
evening
bells
iv
taking
your
fun
every
day
as
you
do
your
work
ten
things
are
necessary
for
happiness
in
this
life
the
first
being
a
good
digestion
and
the
other
nine
money
so
at
least
it
is
said
by
our
modern
philosophers
yet
the
author
of
a
gentle
life
speaks
more
truly
in
saying
that
the
divine
creation
includes
thousands
of
superfluous
joys
which
are
totally
unnecessary
to
the
bare
support
of
life
he
alone
is
the
happy
man
who
has
learned
to
extract
happiness
not
from
ideal
conditions
but
from
the
actual
ones
about
him
the
man
who
has
mastered
the
secret
will
not
wait
for
ideal
surroundings
he
will
not
wait
until
next
year
next
decade
until
he
gets
rich
until
he
can
travel
abroad
until
he
can
afford
to
surround
himself
with
works
of
the
great
masters
but
he
will
make
the
most
out
of
life
where
he
is
why
thus
longing
thus
forever
sighing
for
the
unattained
and
dim
while
the
beautiful
all
round
thee
lying
offers
up
its
low
perpetual
hymn
happy
the
man
and
happy
he
alone
he
who
can
call
his
own
he
who
secure
within
himself
can
say
do
thy
worst
for
i
have
lived
paradise
is
here
or
nowhere
you
must
take
your
joy
with
you
or
you
will
never
find
it
it
is
after
business
hours
not
in
them
that
men
break
down
men
must
like

turn
the

on
business
when
they
leave
it
and

wholesome
recreation
lyman
beecher
used
to
divert
himself
with
a
violin
he
had
a
regular
system
of
what
he
called
unwinding
thus
relieving
the
great
strain
put
upon
him
a
man
says
johnson
should
spend
part
of

with
the

lincoln
as
it
has
been
of
thousands
of
others
if
it
were
not
for
this

the

to

you

and

a

gladstone
early
formed
a
habit
of
looking
on
the
bright
side
of
things
and
never
lost
a
moment
sleep
by
worrying
about
public
business
there
are
many
sports
and
the
very
presence
of
nature
is
to
many
a
great
joy
how
true
it
is
that
if
we
are
cheerful
and
contented
all
nature
smiles
with
us
the
air
seems
more
balmy
the
sky
more
clear
the
earth
has
a
brighter
green
the
trees
have
a
richer
foliage
the
flowers
are
more
fragrant
the
birds
sing
more
sweetly
and
the
sun
moon
and
stars
all
appear
more
beautiful
it
is
a
grand
thing
to
live
to
open
the
eyes
in
the
morning
and
look
out
upon
the
world
to
drink
in
the
pure
air
and
enjoy
the
sweet
sunshine
to
feel
the
pulse
bound
and
the
being
thrill
with
the
consciousness
of
strength
and
power
in
every
nerve
it
is
a
good
thing
simply
to
be
alive
and
it
is
a
good
world
we
live
in
in
spite
of
the
abuse
we
are
fond
of
giving
it
i
love
to
hear
the
bee
sing
amid
the
blossoms
sunny
to
me
his
drowsy
melody
is
sweeter
than
his
honey
for
while
the
shades
are
shifting
along
the
path
to
noon
my
happy
brain
goes
drifting
to
dreamland
on
his
tune
i
love
to
hear
the
wind
blow
amid
the
blushing
petals
and
when
a
fragile
flower
falls
to
watch
it
as
it
settles
and
view
each
leaflet
falling
upon
the
emerald
turf
with
idle
mind
recalling
the
bubbles
on
the
surf
i
love
to
lie
upon
the
grass
and
let
my
glances
wander
earthward
and
skyward
there
while
peacefully
i
ponder
how
much
of
purest
pleasure
earth
holds
for
his
delight
who
takes
life
cup
to
measure
naught
but
its
blessings
bright
upon
every
side
of
us
are
to
be
found
what
one
has
happily
called

mines
and
he
who
goes
prospecting
to
see
what
he
can
daily
discover
is
a
wise
man
training
his
eye
to
see
beauty
in
everything
and
everywhere
one
ought
every
day
says
goethe
at
least
to
hear
a
little
song
read
a
good
poem
see
a
fine
picture
and
if
it
were
possible
to
speak
a
few
reasonable
words
and
if
this
be
good
for
one
self
why
not
try
the
song
the
poem
the
picture
and
the
good
words
on
some
one
else
shall
music
and
poetry
die
out
of
you
while
you
are
struggling
for
that
which
can
never
enrich
the
character
nor
add
to
the
soul
worth
shall
a
disciplined
imagination
fill
the

he
who

upon
will
not

it
was
a
remark
of
archbishop
whately
that
we
ought
not
only
to
cultivate
the
cornfields
of
the
mind
but
the
also
a
life
is
a
cheerful
life
a
happy
union
of
fine
qualities
and
unruffled
temper
a
clear
judgment
and
faculties
in
a
corner
of
his
desk
lincoln
kept
a
copy
of
the
latest
humorous
work
and
it
was
frequently
his
habit
when
fatigued
annoyed
or
depressed
to
take
this
up
and
read
a
chapter
with
great
relief
clean
sensible
wit
or
sheer
nonsense
anything
to
provoke
mirth
and
make
a
man
jollier
this
too
is
a
gift
from
heaven
in
the
world
of
books
what
is
grand
and
inspiring
may
easily
become
a
part
of
every
man
life
a
fondness
for
good
literature
for
good
fiction
for
travel
for
history
and
for
biography
what
is
better
than
this
the
queen
of
the
world
this
title
best
fits
victoria
the
true
queen
of
the
world
but
it
fits
her
best
because
she
is
the
best
type
of
a
noble
wife
the
queen
of
her
husband
heart
and
of
a
queen
mother
whose
children
rise
up
and
call
her
blessed
i
noticed
said
franklin
a
mechanic
among
a
number
of
others
at
work
on
a
house
a
little
way
from
my
office
who
always
appeared
to
be
in
a
merry
humor
he
had
a
kind
word
and
smile
for
every
one
he
met
let
the
day
be
ever
so
cold
gloomy
or
sunless
a
happy
smile
danced
on
his
cheerful
countenance
meeting
him
one
morning
i
asked
him
to
tell
me
the
secret
of
his
constant
flow
of
spirits
is
no
secret
doctor
he
replied
have
one
of
the
best
of
wives
and
when
i
go
to
work
she
always
has
a
kind
word
of
encouragement
for
me
and
when
i
go
home
she
meets
me
with
a
smile
and
a
kiss
and
then
tea
is
sure
to
be
ready
and
she
has
done
so
many
little
things
through
the
day
to
please
me
that
i
can
not
find
it
in
my
heart
to
speak
an
unkind
word
to
anybody
some
of
the
happiest
homes
i
have
ever
been
in
ideal
homes
where
intelligence
peace
and
harmony
dwell
have
been
homes
of
poor
people
no
rich
carpets
covered
the
floors
there
were
no
costly
paintings
on
the
walls
no
piano
no
library
no
works
of
art
but
there
were
contented
minds
devoted
and
unselfish
lives
each
contributing
as
much
as
possible
to
the
happiness
of
all
and
endeavoring
to
compensate
by
intelligence
and
kindness
for
the
poverty
of
their
surroundings
one
cheerful
bright
and
contented
spirit
in
a
household
will
uplift
the
tone
of
all
the
rest
the
keynote
of
the
home
is
in
the
hand
of
the
resolutely
cheerful
member
of
the
family
and
he
or
she
will
set
the
pitch
for
the
rest
young
men
it
is
said
are
apt
to
be
overbearing
imperious
brusque
in
their
manner
they
need
that
suavity
of
manner
and
urbanity
of
demeanor
gracefulness
of
expression
and
delicacy
of
manner
which
can
only
be
gained
by
association
with
the
female
character
which
possesses
the
delicate
instinct
ready
judgment
acute
perceptions
wonderful
intuition
the
blending
of
the
male
and
female
characteristics
produces
the
grandest
character
in
each
the
woman
who
has
what
helen
hunt
so
aptly
called
a
genius
for
affection
she
indeed
is
queen
of
the
home
i
have
often
had
occasion
said
washington
irving
to
remark
the
fortitude
with
which
woman
sustains
the
most
overwhelming
reverses
of
fortune
those
disasters
which
break
down
the
spirit
of
a
man
and
prostrate
him
in
the
dust
seem
to
call
forth
all
the
energies
of
the
softer
sex
and
give
such
intrepidity
and
elevation
to
their
character
that
at
times
it
approaches
sublimity
if
a
wife
can
not
make
her
home
bright
and
happy
so
that
it
shall
be
the
cleanest
sweetest
cheerfulest
place
her
husband
can
find
refuge
in
a
retreat
from
the
toils
and
troubles
of
the
outer
world
then
god
help
the
poor
man
for
he
is
virtually
homeless
hearts
said
longfellow
are
happiest
what
is
a
good
wife
a
good
mother
is
she
not
a
gift
out
of
heaven
sacred
and
delicate
with
affections
so
great
that
no
measuring
line
short
of
that
of
the
infinite
god
can
tell
their
bound
fashioned
to
refine
and
soothe
and
lift
and
irradiate
home
and
society
and
the
world
of
such
value
that
no
one
can
appreciate
it
unless
his
mother
lived
long
enough
to
let
him
understand
it
or
unless
in
some
great
crisis
of
life
when
all
else
failed
him
he
had
a
wife
to
reënforce
him
with
a
faith
in
god
that
nothing
could
disturb
nothing
can
be
more
delightful
than
an
anecdote
of
joseph
choate
of
new
york
our
minister
at
the
court
of
james
upon
being
asked
at
a
who
he
would
prefer
to
be
if
he
could
not
be
himself
he
hesitated
a
moment
apparently
running
over
in
his
mind
the
great
ones
on
earth
when
his
eyes
rested
on
choate
at
the
other
end
of
the
table
who
was
watching
him
with
great
interest
in
her
face
and
suddenly
replied
if
i
could
not
be
myself
i
should
like
to
be
choate
second
husband
pleasant
words
are
as
a
honeycomb
sweet
to
the
soul
and
health
to
the
bones
it
is
the
little
disputes
little
little
insinuations
little
reflections
sharp
criticisms
fretfulness
and
impatience
little
unkindnesses
slurs
little
discourtesies
bad
temper
that
create
most
of
the
discord
and
unhappiness
in
the
family
how
much
it
would
add
to
the
glory
of
the
homes
of
the
world
if
that
might
be
said
of
every
one
which
rogers
said
of
lord
holland
sunshiny
face
he
always
comes
to
breakfast
like
a
man
upon
whom
some
sudden
good
fortune
has
fallen
the
value
of
pleasant
words
every
day
as
you
go
along
is
well
depicted
by
aunt
jerusha
in
what
she
said
to
our
genial
friend
of
herald
if
folks
could
have
their
funerals
when
they
are
alive
and
well
and
struggling
along
what
a
help
it
would
be
she
sighed
upon
returning
from
a
funeral
wondering
how
poor
brown
would
have
felt
if
she
could
have
heard
what
the
minister
said
poor
soul
she
never
dreamed
they
set
so
much
by
her
mis
brown
got
discouraged
ye
see
deacon
brown
he
got
a
way
of
blaming
everything
on
to
her
i
do
suppose
the
deacon
meant
it
was
just
his
way
but
it
awful
wearing
when
things
wore
out
or
broke
he
acted
just
as
if
mis
brown
did
it
herself
on
purpose
and
they
all
caught
it
like
the
measles
or
the
and
the
minister
how
the
deacon
brought
his
young
wife
here
when
nothing
but
a
wilderness
and
how
patiently
she
bore
hardship
and
what
a
good
wife
she
been
now
the
minister
have
known
anything
about
that
if
the
deacon
had
told
him
dear
dear
if
he
only
told
mis
brown
herself
what
he
thought
i
do
believe
he
might
have
saved
the
funeral
and
when
the
minister
said
how
the
children
would
miss
their
mother
seemed
as
though
they
could
stand
it
poor
things
well
i
guess
it
is
true
enough
mis
brown
was
always
doing
for
some
of
them
when
they
was
singing
about
sweet
rest
in
heaven
i
help
thinking
that
that
was
something
mis
brown
would
have
to
get
used
to
for
she
never
had
none
of
it
here
she
have
been
awful
pleased
with
the
flowers
they
was
pretty
and
no
mistake
ye
see
the
deacon
never
willing
for
her
to
have
a
he
said
was
enough
prettier
sight
to
see
good
cabbages
but
mis
brown
always
kind
of
hankered
after
things
like
roses
and
such
what
did
you
say
levi
time
for
supper
well
land
sake
so
it
is
i
must
have
got
to
meditating
i
been
levi
you
need
tell
the
minister
anything
about
me
if
the
pancakes
and
pumpkin
pies
are
good
you
just
say
so
as
we
go
along
it
ai
best
to
keep
everything
laid
up
for
funerals
is
the
grand
secret
of
a
happy
home
to
express
the
affection
you
really
he
is
the
happiest
it
was
said
by
goethe
be
he
king
or
peasant
who
finds
peace
in
his
home
there
are
indeed
many
serious
too
fathers
and
mothers
who
do
not
wish
to
advertise
their
children
to
all
the
neighbors
as
the
laughing
family
if
this
be
so
yet
at
the
very
least
these
solemn
parents
may
read
the
bible
where
it
is
said
provoke
not
your
children
to
wrath
it
means
literally
do
not
irritate
your
children
do
not
rub
them
up
the
wrong
way
children
ought
never
to
get
the
impression
that
they
live
in
a
hopeless
cheerless
cold
world
but
the
household
cheerfulness
should
transform
their
lives
like
sunlight
making
their
hearts
glad
with
little
things
rejoicing
upon
small
occasion
how
beautiful
would
our
be
if
every
little
child
at
the
hour
could
look
into
the
faces
of
the
older
ones
and
say
had
such
sweet
times
to
love
and
to
be
loved
says
sydney
smith
is
the
greatest
happiness
of
existence
finding
what
you
do
not
seek
dining
one
day
with
baron
james
rothschild
eugene
delacroix
the
famous
french
artist
confessed
that
during
some
time
past
he
had
vainly
sought
for
a
head
to
serve
as
a
model
for
that
of
a
beggar
in
a
picture
which
he
was
painting
and
that
as
he
gazed
at
his
host
features
the
idea
suddenly
occurred
to
him
that
the
very
head
he
desired
was
before
him
rothschild
being
a
great
lover
of
art
readily
consented
to
sit
as
the
beggar
the
next
day
at
the
studio
delacroix
placed
a
tunic
around
the
baron
shoulders
put
a
stout
staff
in
his
hand
and
made
him
pose
as
if
he
were
resting
on
the
steps
of
an
ancient
roman
temple
in
this
attitude
he
was
found
by
one
of
the
artist
favorite
pupils
in
a
brief
absence
of
the
master
from
the
room
the
youth
naturally
concluded
that
the
beggar
had
just
been
brought
in
and
with
a
sympathetic
look
quietly
slipped
a
piece
of
money
into
his
hand
rothschild
thanked
him
simply
pocketed
the
money
and
the
student
passed
out
rothschild
then
inquired
of
the
master
and
found
that
the
young
man
had
talent
but
very
slender
means
soon
after
the
youth
received
a
letter
stating
that
charity
bears
interest
and
that
the
accumulated
interest
on
the
amount
he
had
given
to
one
he
supposed
to
be
a
beggar
was
represented
by
the
sum
of
ten
thousand
francs
which
was
awaiting
his
claim
at
the
rothschild
office
this
illustrates
well
the
art
of
cheerful
amusement
even
if
one
has
great
business
cares
the
entertainment
of
the
artist
the
personation
of
a
beggar
and
an
act
of
beneficence
toward
a
worthy
student
it
illustrates
too
what
was
said
by
wilhelm
von
humboldt
that
it
is
worthy
of
special
remark
that
when
we
are
not
too
anxious
about
happiness
and
unhappiness
but
devote
ourselves
to
the
strict
and
unsparing
performance
of
duty
then
happiness
comes
of
itself
we
carry
each
day
nobly
doing
the
duty
or
enjoying
the
privilege
of
the
moment
without
thinking
whether
or
not
it
will
make
us
happy
this
is
quite
in
accord
with
the
saying
of
george
herbert
the
consciousness
of
duty
performed
gives
us
music
at
midnight
are
not
buoyant
spirits
like
water
sparkling
when
it
runs
have
found
my
greatest
happiness
in
said
gladstone
i
early
formed
a
habit
of
industry
and
it
has
been
its
own
reward
the
young
are
apt
to
think
that
rest
means
a
cessation
from
all
effort
but
i
have
found
the
most
perfect
rest
in
changing
effort
if
over
books
and
study
go
out
into
the
blessed
sunlight
and
the
pure
air
and
give
heartfelt
exercise
to
the
body
the
brain
will
soon
become
calm
and
rested
the
efforts
of
nature
are
ceaseless
even
in
our
sleep
the
heart
throbs
on
i
try
to
live
close
to
nature
and
to
imitate
her
in
my
labors
the
compensation
is
sound
sleep
a
wholesome
digestion
and
powers
that
are
kept
at
their
best
and
this
i
take
it
is
the
chief
reward
of
industry
owing
to
ingrained
habits
said
horace
mann
work
has
always
been
to
me
what
water
is
to
a
fish
i
have
wondered
a
thousand
times
to
hear
people
say
do
like
this
business
or
wish
i
could
exchange
it
for
that
for
with
me
when
i
have
had
anything
to
do
i
do
not
remember
ever
to
have
demurred
but
have
always
set
about
it
like
a
fatalist
and
it
was
as
sure
to
be
done
as
the
sun
was
to
set
personal
enjoyment
is
a
very
small
thing
but
one
personal
usefulness
is
a
very
important
thing
those
only
are
happy
who
have
their
minds
fixed
on
some
object
other
than
their
own
the
most
delicate
the
most
sensible
of
all
pleasures
says
la
bruyère
consists
in
promoting
the
pleasures
of
others
and
hawthorne
has
said
that
the
inward
pleasure
of
imparting
pleasure
is
the
choicest
of
all
oh
it
is
great
said
carlyle
and
there
is
no
other
greatness
to
make
some
nook
of
god
creation
more
fruitful
better
more
worthy
of
god
to
make
some
human
heart
a
little
wiser
manlier
happier
more
blessed
less
accursed
the
gladness
of
service
of
having
some
honorable
share
in
the
world
work
what
is
better
than
this
the
lord
must
love
the
common
people
said
lincoln
for
he
made
so
many
of
them
and
so
few
of
the
other
kind
to
extend
to
all
the
cup
of
joy
is
indeed
angelic
business
and
there
is
nothing
that
makes
one
more
beautiful
than
to
be
engaged
in
it
the
high
desire
that
others
may
be
blest
savors
of
heaven
the
memory
of
those
who
spend
their
days
in
hanging
sweet
pictures
of
faith
and
trust
in
the
galleries
of
sunless
lives
shall
never
perish
from
the
earth
doing
good
by
stealth
and
having
it
found
out
by
accident
this
said
charles
lamb
is
the
greatest
pleasure
i
know
money
never
yet
made
a
man
happy
said
franklin
and
there
is
nothing
in
its
nature
to
produce
happiness
to
do
good
with
it
makes
life
a
delight
to
the
giver
how
happy
then
was
the
life
of
jean
ingelow
since
what
she
received
from
the
sale
of
a
hundred
thousand
copies
of
her
poems
and
fifty
thousand
of
her
prose
works
she
spent
largely
in
charity
one
unique
charity
being
a
copyright
dinner
three
times
a
week
to
twelve
poor
persons
just
discharged
from
the
neighboring
hospitals
nor
was
any
one
made
happier
by
it
than
the
poet
john
buskin
inherited
a
million
dollars
with
this
money
he
set
about
doing
good
says
a
writer
in
the
arena
poor
young
men
and
women
who
were
struggling
to
get
an
education
were
helped
homes
for
working
men
and
women
were
established
and
model
apartment
houses
were
erected
he
also
promoted
a
work
for
reclaiming
waste
land
outside
of
london
this
land
was
used
for
the
aid
of
unfortunate
men
who
wished
to
rise
again
from
the
state
in
which
they
had
fallen
through
cruel
social
conditions
and
their
own
weaknesses
it
is
said
that
this
work
suggested
to
general
booth
his
colonization
farms
ruskin
has
also
ever
been
liberal
in
aiding
poor
artists
and
has
done
much
to
encourage
artistic
taste
among
the
young
on
one
occasion
he
purchased
ten
fine
paintings
by
holman
hunt
for
to
be
hung
in
the
public
schools
of
london
by
he
had
disposed
of
of
his
inheritance
besides
all
the
income
from
his
books
but
the
calls
of
the
poor
and
his
plans
looking
toward
educating
and
ennobling
the
lives
of
working
men
giving
more
sunshine
and
joy
were
such
that
he
determined
to
dispose
of
all
the
remainder
of
his
wealth
except
a
sum
sufficient
to
yield
him
a
year
on
which
to
live
our
own
peter
cooper
in
his
last
days
was
one
of
the
happiest
men
in
america
his
beneficence
shone
in
his
countenance
let
the
man
who
has
the
blues
take
a
map
and
census
table
of
the
world
and
estimate
how
many
millions
there
are
who
would
gladly
exchange
lots
with
him
and
let
him
begin
upon
some
practicable
plan
to
do
all
the
good
he
can
to
as
many
as
he
can
and
he
will
forget
to
be
despondent
and
he
need
not
stop
short
at
praying
for
them
without
first
giving
every
dollar
he
can
without
troubling
the
lord
about
that
let
him
scatter
his
flowers
as
he
goes
along
since
he
will
never
go
over
the
same
road
again
no
man
in
england
had
a
better
time
than
did
du
maurier
on
that
cold
day
when
he
took
the
hat
of
an
old
soldier
on
hampstead
road
and
sent
him
away
to
the
soup
kitchen
in
euston
to
get
warm
the
artist
chalked
on
a
blackboard
such
portraits
as
he
commonly
made
for
punch
and
soon
gathered
a
great
quantity
of
small
coins
for
the
grateful
soldier
who
however
at
once
rubbed
out
du
maurier
pictures
and
put
on
the
faithful
dog
and
a
battle
scene
as
more
artistic
chinese
gordon
after
serving
faithfully
and
valiantly
in
the
great
chinese
rebellion
and
receiving
the
highest
honors
of
the
chinese
empire
returned
to
england
caring
little
for
the
praise
thus
heaped
on
him
he
took
some
position
at
gravesend
just
below
london
where
he
filled
his
house
with
boys
from
the
streets
whom
he
taught
and
made
men
of
and
then
secured
them
places
on
ships
following
them
all
over
the
world
with
letters
of
advice
and
encouragement
his
head
in
a
hole
i
was
appointed
to
lecture
in
a
town
in
great
britain
six
miles
from
the
railway
said
john
gough
and
a
man
drove
me
in
a
fly
from
the
station
to
the
town
i
noticed
that
he
sat
leaning
forward
in
an
awkward
manner
with
his
face
close
to
the
glass
of
the
window
soon
he
folded
a
handkerchief
and
tied
it
round
his
neck
i
asked
him
if
he
was
cold
no
sir
then
he
placed
the
handkerchief
round
his
face
i
asked
him
if
he
had
the
toothache
no
sir
was
the
reply
still
he
sat
leaning
forward
at
last
i
said
will
you
please
tell
me
why
you
sit
leaning
forward
that
way
with
a
handkerchief
round
your
neck
if
you
are
not
cold
and
have
no
toothache
he
said
very
quietly
the
window
of
the
carriage
is
broke
and
the
wind
is
cold
and
i
am
trying
to
keep
it
from
you
i
said
in
surprise
you
are
not
putting
your
face
to
that
broken
pane
to
keep
the
wind
from
me
are
you
yes
sir
i
am
why
do
you
do
that
god
bless
you
sir
i
owe
everything
i
have
in
the
world
to
you
but
i
never
saw
you
before
no
sir
but
i
have
seen
you
i
was
a
once
i
used
to
go
round
with
a
baby
in
my
arms
for
charity
and
a
draggled
wife
at
my
heels
half
the
time
with
her
eyes
blackened
and
i
went
to
hear
you
in
edinburgh
and
told
me
i
was
a
and
when
i
went
out
of
that
house
i
said
the
help
of
god
i
be
a
man
and
now
i
a
happy
wife
and
a
comfortable
home
god
bless
you
sir
i
would
stick
my
head
in
any
hole
under
the
heavens
if
it
would
do
you
any
good
let
find
the
sunny
side
of
men
or
be
believers
in
it
a
light
there
is
in
every
soul
that
takes
the
pains
to
win
it
oh
there
a
slumbering
good
in
all
and
we
perchance
may
wake
it
our
hands
contain
the
magic
wand
this
life
is
what
we
make
it
he
indeed
is
getting
the
most
out
of
life
who
does
most
to
elevate
mankind
how
happy
were
those
little
sisters
of
the
poor
at
tours
who
took
scissors
to
divide
their
last
remnant
of
bedclothing
with
an
old
woman
who
came
to
them
at
night
craving
hospitality
and
how
happy
was
that
american
who
gave
up
the
best
room
in
the
house
which
she
had
engaged
long
before
the
season
opened
at
a
mountain
sanitarium
during
the
late
war
taking
instead
of
it
the
poorest
room
in
the
house
that
she
might
give
good
quarters
to
a
soldier
just
out
of
his
camp
hospital
teach
said
walter
scott
and
make
its
practice
pleasurable
and
you
create
for
the
world
a
destiny
more
sublime
than
ever
issued
from
the
brain
of
the
wildest
dreamer
yet
how
many
there
are
ready
to
make
some
great
sacrifice
who
neglect
those
little
acts
of
kindness
which
make
so
many
lives
brighter
and
happier
i
say
jim
it
the
first
time
i
ever
had
anybody
ask
my
parding
and
it
kind
o
took
me
off
my
feet
a
young
lady
had
knocked
him
down
in
hastily
turning
a
corner
she
stopped
and
said
to
the
ragged
i
beg
your
pardon
my
little
fellow
i
am
very
sorry
i
ran
against
you
he
took
off
the
piece
of
a
cap
he
had
on
his
skull
made
a
low
bow
and
said
with
a
broad
smile
you
have
my
parding
miss
and
welcome
and
the
next
time
you
run
agin
me
you
can
knock
me
clean
down
and
i
wo
say
a
word
one
of
the
greatest
mistakes
of
life
is
to
save
our
smiles
and
pleasant
words
and
sympathy
for
those
of
our
set
or
for
those
not
now
with
us
and
for
other
times
than
the
present
if
a
word
or
two
will
render
a
man
happy
said
a
frenchman
he
must
be
a
wretch
indeed
who
will
not
give
it
it
is
like
lighting
another
man
candle
with
your
own
which
loses
none
of
its
brilliancy
by
what
the
other
gains
sydney
smith
recommends
us
to
make
at
least
one
person
happy
every
day
take
ten
years
and
you
will
make
hundred
and
fifty
persons
happy
or
brighten
a
small
town
by
your
contribution
to
the
fund
of
general
joy
one
who
is
cheerful
is
preeminently
useful
raffles
once
said
i
have
made
it
a
rule
never
to
be
with
a
person
ten
minutes
without
trying
to
make
him
happier
it
was
a
remark
of
dwight
that
one
who
makes
a
little
child
happier
for
half
an
hour
is
a
with
god
a
little
boy
said
to
his
mother
i
could
make
little
sister
happy
nohow
i
could
fix
it
but
i
made
myself
happy
trying
to
make
her
happy
i
make
jim
happy
and
he
laughs
said
another
boy
speaking
of
his
invalid
brother
and
that
makes
me
happy
and
i
laugh
there
was
once
a
king
who
loved
his
little
boy
very
much
and
took
a
great
deal
of
pains
to
please
him
so
he
gave
him
a
pony
to
ride
beautiful
rooms
to
live
in
pictures
books
toys
without
number
teachers
companions
and
everything
that
money
could
buy
or
ingenuity
devise
but
for
all
this
the
young
prince
was
unhappy
he
wore
a
frown
wherever
he
went
and
was
always
wishing
for
something
he
did
not
have
at
length
a
magician
came
to
the
court
he
saw
the
scowl
on
the
face
and
said
to
the
king
i
can
make
your
son
happy
and
turn
his
frowns
into
smiles
but
you
must
pay
me
a
great
price
for
telling
him
this
secret
all
right
said
the
king
whatever
you
ask
i
will
give
the
magician
took
the
boy
into
a
private
room
he
wrote
something
with
a
white
substance
on
a
piece
of
paper
he
gave
the
boy
a
candle
and
told
him
to
light
it
and
hold
it
under
the
paper
and
then
see
what
he
could
read
then
the
magician
went
away
the
boy
did
as
he
had
been
told
and
the
white
letters
turned
into
a
beautiful
blue
they
formed
these
words
do
a
kindness
to
some
one
every
day
the
prince
followed
the
advice
and
became
the
happiest
boy
in
the
realm
happiness
says
one
writer
is
a
mosaic
composed
of
many
smaller
stones
it
is
the
little
acts
of
kindness
the
little
courtesies
the
disposition
to
be
accommodating
to
be
helpful
to
be
sympathetic
to
be
unselfish
to
be
careful
not
to
wound
the
feelings
not
to
expose
the
sore
spots
to
be
charitable
of
the
weaknesses
of
others
to
be
considerate
these
are
the
little
things
which
added
up
at
night
are
found
to
be
the
secret
of
a
happy
day
how
much
greater
are
all
these
than
one
great
act
of
noteworthy
goodness
once
a
year
our
lives
are
made
up
of
trifles
emergencies
rarely
occur
little
things
unimportant
events
experiences
so
small
as
to
scarcely
leave
a
trace
behind
make
up
the
of
life
and
the
one
great
thing
in
life
is
to
do
a
little
good
to
every
one
we
meet
ready
sympathy
a
quick
eye
and
a
little
tact
are
all
that
are
needed
this
point
is
happily
illustrated
by
this
report
of
an
incident
upon
a
train
from
providence
to
boston
a
lady
was
caring
for
her
father
whose
mental
faculties
were
weakened
by
age
he
imagined
that
some
imperative
duty
called
on
him
to
leave
the
train
and
his
daughter
could
not
quiet
him
just
then
she
noticed
a
large
man
watching
them
over
the
top
of
his
paper
as
soon
as
he
caught
her
eye
he
rose
and
crossed
quickly
to
her
i
beg
your
pardon
you
are
in
trouble
may
i
help
you
she
explained
the
situation
to
him
what
is
your
father
name
he
asked
she
told
him
and
then
with
an
encouraging
smile
she
spoke
to
her
venerable
father
who
was
sitting
immediately
in
front
of
her
the
next
moment
the
large
man
turned
over
the
seat
and
leaning
toward
the
troubled
old
man
he
addressed
him
by
name
shook
hands
with
him
cordially
and
engaged
him
in
a
conversation
so
interesting
and
so
cleverly
arranged
to
keep
his
mind
occupied
that
the
old
gentleman
forgot
his
need
to
leave
the
train
and
did
not
think
of
it
again
until
they
were
in
boston
there
the
stranger
put
the
lady
and
her
charge
into
a
carriage
received
her
assurance
that
she
felt
perfectly
safe
and
was
about
to
close
the
carriage
door
when
she
remembered
that
she
had
felt
so
safe
in
the
keeping
of
this
man
that
she
had
not
even
asked
his
name
hastily
putting
her
hand
against
the
door
she
said
pardon
me
but
you
have
rendered
me
such
service
may
i
not
know
whom
i
am
thanking
the
big
man
smiled
as
he
turned
away
and
answered
phillips
brooks
what
a
gift
it
is
said
beecher
who
was
the
great
preacher
of
cheerfulness
to
make
all
men
better
and
happier
without
knowing
it
we
do
not
suppose
that
flowers
know
how
sweet
they
are
these
roses
and
carnations
have
made
me
happy
for
a
day
yet
they
stand
huddled
together
in
my
pitcher
without
seeming
to
know
my
thoughts
of
them
or
the
gracious
work
they
are
doing
and
how
much
more
is
it
to
have
a
disposition
that
carries
with
it
involuntarily
sweetness
calmness
courage
hope
and
happiness
yet
this
is
the
portion
of
good
nature
in
a
man
when
it
has
made
him
happy
it
has
scarcely
begun
its
office
god
sends
a
natural
a
man
whose
nature
is
large
and
luminous
and
who
by
his
very
carriage
and
spontaneous
actions
calms
cheers
and
helps
his
fellows
god
bless
him
for
he
blesses
everybody
this
is
just
what
beecher
would
have
said
about
phillips
brooks
and
what
better
can
be
said
than
to
compare
the
heart
good
cheer
to
a
floral
offering
not
flowers
appropriate
gifts
to
persons
of
all
ages
in
any
conceivable
circumstances
in
which
they
are
placed
so
the
heart
good
cheer
and
deeds
of
kindness
are
always
acceptable
to
children
and
youth
to
busy
men
and
women
to
the
aged
and
to
a
world
of
thus
live
and
die
o
man
immortal
says
chalmers
live
for
something
do
good
and
leave
behind
you
a
monument
of
virtue
which
the
storms
of
time
can
never
destroy
write
your
name
in
kindness
love
and
mercy
on
the
hearts
of
those
who
come
in
contact
with
you
and
you
will
never
be
forgotten
good
deeds
will
shine
as
brightly
on
earth
as
the
stars
of
heaven
what
is
needed
to
round
out
human
happiness
is
a
life
not
ease
not
pleasure
not
happiness
but
a
man
nature
is
after
there
is
says
robert
waters
no
success
without
honor
no
happiness
without
a
clear
conscience
no
use
in
living
at
all
if
only
for
one
self
it
is
not
at
all
necessary
for
you
to
make
a
fortune
but
it
is
necessary
absolutely
necessary
that
you
should
become
a
honorable
useful
man
radiating
goodness
and
cheerfulness
wherever
you
go
and
making
your
life
a
blessing
when
a
man
does
not
find
repose
in
himself
says
a
french
proverb
it
is
vain
for
him
to
seek
it
elsewhere
happy
is
he
who
has
no
sense
of
discord
with
the
harmony
of
the
universe
who
is
open
to
the
voices
of
nature
and
of
the
spiritual
realm
and
who
sees
the
light
that
never
was
on
sea
or
land
such
a
life
can
but
give
expression
to
its
inward
harmony
every
pure
and
healthy
thought
every
noble
aspiration
for
the
good
and
the
true
every
longing
of
the
heart
for
a
higher
and
better
life
every
lofty
purpose
and
unselfish
endeavor
makes
the
human
spirit
stronger
more
harmonious
and
more
beautiful
it
is
this
alone
that
gives
a
confidence
in
one
powers
and
a
cheerfulness
like
that
of
a
celestial
spirit
it
is
this
which
an
old
writer
has
called
the
paradise
of
a
good
conscience
i
count
this
thing
to
be
grandly
true
that
a
noble
deed
is
a
step
toward
god
lifting
the
soul
from
the
common
clod
to
a
purer
air
and
a
broader
view
we
rise
by
the
things
that
are
under
our
feet
by
what
we
have
mastered
of
good
or
gain
by
the
pride
deposed
and
the
passion
slain
and
the
vanquished
ills
that
we
hourly
meet
my
body
must
walk
the
earth
said
an
ancient
poet
but
i
can
put
wings
on
my
soul
and
plumes
to
my
hardest
thought
the
splendors
and
symphonies
and
the
ecstacies
of
a
higher
world
are
with
us
now
in
the
rudimentary
organs
of
eye
and
ear
and
heart
much
we
have
to
do
much
we
have
to
love
much
we
have
to
hope
for
and
our
joy
is
the
grace
we
say
to
god
when
i
think
upon
god
said
haydn
to
carpani
my
heart
is
so
full
of
joy
that
the
notes
leap
from
my
pen
says
gibbons
our
lives
are
songs
god
writes
the
words
and
we
set
them
to
music
at
leisure
and
the
song
is
sad
or
the
song
is
glad
as
we
choose
to
fashion
the
measure
we
must
write
the
song
whatever
the
words
whatever
its
rhyme
or
meter
and
if
it
is
sad
we
must
make
it
glad
and
if
sweet
we
must
make
it
sweeter
vi
looking
pleasant
something
to
be
worked
from
the
inside
acting
on
a
sudden
impulse
an
elderly
woman
the
widow
of
a
soldier
who
had
been
killed
in
the
civil
war
went
into
a
photographer
to
have
her
picture
taken
she
was
seated
before
the
camera
wearing
the
same
stern
hard
forbidding
look
that
had
made
her
an
object
of
fear
to
the
children
living
in
the
neighborhood
when
the
photographer
thrusting
his
head
out
from
the
black
cloth
said
suddenly
brighten
the
eyes
a
little
she
tried
but
the
dull
and
heavy
look
still
lingered
look
a
little
pleasanter
said
the
photographer
in
an
unimpassioned
but
confident
and
commanding
voice
see
here
the
woman
retorted
sharply
if
you
think
that
an
old
woman
who
is
dull
can
look
bright
that
one
who
feels
cross
can
become
pleasant
every
time
she
is
told
to
you
do
know
anything
about
human
nature
it
takes
something
from
the
outside
to
brighten
the
eye
and
illuminate
the
face
oh
no
it
does
something
to
be
worked
from
the
try
it
again
said
the
photographer
something
in
his
manner
inspired
faith
and
she
tried
again
this
time
with
better
success
that
good
that
fine
you
look
twenty
years
younger
exclaimed
the
artist
as
he
caught
the
transient
glow
that
illuminated
the
faded
face
she
went
home
with
a
queer
feeling
in
her
heart
it
was
the
first
compliment
she
had
received
since
her
husband
had
passed
away
and
it
left
a
pleasant
memory
behind
when
she
reached
her
little
cottage
she
looked
long
in
the
glass
and
said
there
may
be
something
in
it
but
i
wait
and
see
the
picture
when
the
picture
came
it
was
like
a
resurrection
the
face
seemed
alive
with
the
lost
fires
of
youth
she
gazed
long
and
earnestly
then
said
in
a
clear
firm
voice
if
i
could
do
it
once
i
can
do
it
again
approaching
the
little
mirror
above
her
bureau
she
said
brighten
up
catherine
and
the
old
light
flashed
up
once
more
look
a
little
pleasanter
she
commanded
and
a
calm
and
radiant
smile
diffused
itself
over
the
face
her
neighbors
as
the
writer
of
this
story
has
said
soon
remarked
the
change
that
had
come
over
her
face
why
you
are
getting
young
how
do
you
manage
it
is
almost
all
done
from
the
inside
you
just
brighten
up
inside
and
feel
fate
served
me
meanly
but
i
looked
at
her
and
laughed
that
none
might
know
how
bitter
was
the
cup
i
quaffed
along
came
joy
and
paused
beside
me
where
i
sat
saying
came
to
see
what
you
were
laughing
at
emotion

into

passions
petulance

every
dishonest
act
every

every
feeling
of
envy
jealousy
fear
each
has
its
effect
on
the

deleteriously

think
says
sir

that
the

would
be

oliver
wendell
holmes
in
advanced
years
acknowledged
his
debt
of
gratitude
to
the
nurse
of
his
childhood
who
studiously
taught
him
to
ignore
unpleasant
incidents
if
he
stubbed
his
toe
or
skinned
his
knee
or
bumped
his
nose
his
nurse
would
never
permit
his
mind
to
dwell
upon
the
temporary
pain
but
claimed
his
attention
for
some
pretty
object
or
charming
story
or
happy
reminiscence
to
her
he
said
he
was
largely
indebted
for
the
sunshine
of
a
long
life
it
is
a
lesson
which
is
easily
mastered
in
childhood
but
seldom
to
be
learned
in
middle
life
and
never
in
old
age
when
i
was
a
boy
says
another
author
i
was
consoled
for
cutting
my
finger
by
having
my
attention
called
to
the
fact
that
i
had
not
broken
my
arm
and
when
i
got
a
cinder
in
my
eye
i
was
expected
to
feel
more
comfortable
because
my
cousin
had
lost
his
eye
by
an
accident
we
should
brave
trouble
says
beecher
as
the
new
england
boy
braves
winter
the
school
is
a
mile
away
over
the
hill
yet
he
lingers
not
by
the
fire
but
with
his
books
slung
over
his
shoulder
he
sets
out
to
face
the
storm
when
he
reaches
the
topmost
ridge
where
the
snow
lies
in
drifts
and
the
north
wind
comes
keen
and
biting
does
he
shrink
and
cower
down
by
the
fences
or
run
into
the
nearest
house
to
warm
himself
no
he
buttons
up
his
coat
and
rejoices
to
defy
the
blast
and
tosses
the
with
his
foot
and
so
erect
and
fearless
with
strong
heart
and
ruddy
cheek
he
goes
on
to
his
place
at
school
children
should
be
taught
the
habit
of
finding
pleasure
everywhere
and
to
see
the
bright
side
of
everything
serenity
of
mind
comes
easy
to
some
and
hard
to
others
it
can
be
taught
and
learned
we
ought
to
have
teachers
who
are
able
to
educate
us
in
this
department
of
our
natures
quite
as
much
as
in
music
or
art
think
of
a
school
or
classes
for
training
men
and
women
to
carry
themselves
serenely
amid
all
the
trials
that
beset
them
joy
is
the
mainspring
in
the
whole
of
endless
nature
calm
rotation
joy
moves
the
dazzling
wheels
that
roll
in
the
great
timepiece
of

schiller
the
do
worry
society
was
organized
not
long
ago
in
new
york
it
is
however
just
as
well
suited
to
other
latitudes
and
longitudes
it
is
intended
for
people
who
can
not
help
worrying
if
really
you
ca
help
it
you
are
in
an
abnormal
condition
you
have
lost
it
is
a
mild
type
of
mental
derangement
you
must
attack
your
bad
habit
of
worrying
as
you
would
a
disease
it
is
definitely
something
to
be
overcome
an
infirmity
that
you
are
to
get
rid
of
be
good
and
you
will
be
happy
is
a
very
old
piece
of
advice
mary
livermore
now
proposes
to
reverse
it
be
happy
and
you
will
be
good
if
unhappiness
is
a
bad
habit
you
are
to
turn
about
by
sheer
force
of
will
and
practice
cheerfulness
happiness
is
a
thing
to
be
practiced
like
a
violin
not
work
but
worry
fretfulness
friction
these
are
our
foes
in
america
you
should
not
go
here
and
there
making
prominent
either
your
bad
manners
or
a
gloomy
face
who
has
a
right
to
rob
other
people
of
their
happiness
do
not
says
emerson
hang
a
dismal
picture
on
your
wall
and
do
not
deal
with
sables
and
glooms
in
your
conversation
if
you
are
not
at
the
moment
cheerful
look
speak
act
as
if
you
were
you
know
i
had
no
money
i
had
nothing
to
give
but
myself
said
a
woman
who
had
great
sorrows
to
bear
but
who
bore
them
cheerfully
i
formed
a
resolution
never
to
sadden
any
one
else
with
my
troubles
i
have
laughed
and
told
jokes
when
i
could
have
wept
i
have
always
smiled
in
the
face
of
every
misfortune
i
have
tried
never
to
let
any
one
go
from
my
presence
without
a
happy
word
or
a
bright
thought
to
carry
away
and
happiness
makes
happiness
i
myself
am
happier
than
i
should
have
been
had
i
sat
down
and
bemoaned
my
fate
is
easy
enough
to
be
pleasant
when
life
flows
along
like
a
song
but
the
man
worth
while
is
the
one
who
will
smile
when
everything
goes
dead
wrong
for
the
test
of
the
heart
is
trouble
and
it
always
comes
with
the
years
and
the
smile
that
is
worth
the
praise
of
the
earth
is
the
smile
that
comes
through
tears
a
pleasure
book
she
is
an
aged
woman
but
her
face
is
serene
and
peaceful
though
trouble
has
not
passed
her
by
she
seems
utterly
above
the
little
worries
and
vexations
which
torment
the
average
woman
and
leave
lines
of
care
the
fretful
woman
asked
her
one
day
the
secret
of
her
happiness
and
the
beautiful
old
face
shone
with
joy
dear
she
said
keep
a
pleasure
book
what
pleasure
book
long
ago
i
learned
that
there
is
no
day
so
dark
and
gloomy
that
it
does
not
contain
some
ray
of
light
and
i
have
made
it
one
business
of
my
life
to
write
down
the
little
things
which
mean
so
much
to
a
woman
i
have
a
book
marked
for
every
day
of
every
year
since
i
left
school
it
is
but
a
little
thing
the
new
gown
the
chat
with
a
friend
the
thoughtfulness
of
my
husband
a
flower
a
book
a
walk
in
the
field
a
letter
a
concert
or
a
drive
but
it
all
goes
into
my
pleasure
book
and
when
i
am
inclined
to
fret
i
read
a
few
pages
to
see
what
a
happy
blessed
woman
i
am
you
may
see
my
treasures
if
you
will
slowly
the
peevish
discontented
woman
turned
over
the
book
her
friend
brought
her
reading
a
little
here
and
there
one
day
entries
ran
thus
a
pleasant
letter
from
mother
saw
a
beautiful
lily
in
a
window
found
the
pin
i
thought
i
had
lost
saw
such
a
bright
happy
girl
on
the
street
husband
brought
some
roses
in
the
evening
bits
of
verse
and
lines
from
her
daily
reading
have
gone
into
the
pleasure
book
of
this
woman
until
its
pages
are
a
storehouse
of
truth
and
beauty
you
found
a
pleasure
for
every
day
the
fretful
woman
asked
every
day
the
low
voice
answered
had
to
make
my
theory
come
true
you
know
the
fretful
woman
ought
to
have
stopped
there
but
did
not
and
she
found
that
page
where
it
was
written
he
died
with
his
hand
in
mine
and
my
name
upon
his
lips
below
were
the
lines
from
lowell
lone
watcher
on
the
mountain
height
it
is
right
precious
to
behold
the
first
long
surf
of
climbing
light
flood
all
the
thirsty
eat
with
gold
yet
god
deems
not
thine
aeried
sight
more
worthy
than
our
twilight
dim
for
meek
obedience
too
is
light
and
following
that
is
finding
him
in
one
of
the
battles
of
the
crimea
a
struck
inside
the
fort
crashing
through
a
beautiful
garden
but
from
the
ugly
chasm
there
burst
forth
a
spring
of
water
which
is
still
flowing
and
how
beautiful
it
is
if
our
strange
earthly
sorrows
become
a
blessing
to
others
through
our
determination
to
live
and
to
do
for
those
who
need
our
help
life
is
not
given
for
mourning
but
for
unselfish
service
cheerfulness
says
ruskin
is
as
natural
to
the
heart
of
a
man
in
strong
health
as
color
to
his
cheek
and
wherever
there
is
habitual
gloom
there
must
be
either
bad
air
unwholesome
food
improperly
severe
labor
or
erring
habits
of
life
it
is
an
erring
habit
of
life
if
we
are
not
first
of
all
cheerful
we
are
thrown
into
a
morbid
habit
through
circumstances
utterly
beyond
our
control
yet
this
fact
does
not
change
our
duty
toward
god
and
toward
man
our
duty
to
be
cheerful
we
are
human
but
it
is
our
high
privilege
to
lead
a
divine
life
to
accept
the
joy
which
our
lord
bequeathed
to
his
disciples
our
trouble
is
that
we
do
not
half
will
after
a
man
habits
are
well
set
about
all
he
can
do
is
to
sit
by
and
observe
which
way
he
is
going
regret
it
as
he
may
how
helpless
is
a
weak
man
bound
by
the
mighty
cable
of
habit
twisted
from
tiny
threads
which
he
thought
were
absolutely
within
his
control
yet
a
habit
of
happy
thought
would
transform
his
life
into
harmony
and
beauty
is
not
the
will
almost
omnipotent
to
determine
habits
before
they
become
what
contributes
more
to
health
or
happiness
than
a
vigorous
will
a
habit
of
directing
a
firm
and
steady
will
upon
those
things
which
tend
to
produce
harmony
of
thought
will
bring
happiness
and
contentment
the
will
rightly
drilled
and
divinely
guided
can
drive
out
all
discordant
thoughts
and
usher
in
the
reign
of
perpetual
harmony
it
is
impossible
to
overestimate
the
importance
of
forming
a
habit
of
cheerfulness
early
in
life
the
serene
optimist
is
one
whose
mind
has
dwelt
so
long
upon
the
sunny
side
of
life
that
he
has
acquired
a
habit
of
cheerfulness
talk
happiness
the
world
is
sad
enough
without
your
woes
no
path
is
wholly
rough
look
for
the
places
that
are
smooth
and
clear
and
speak
of
those
who
rest
the
weary
ear
of
earth
so
hurt
by
one
continuous
strain
of
human
discontent
and
grief
and
pain
talk
faith
the
world
is
better
off
without
your
uttered
ignorance
and
morbid
doubt
if
you
have
faith
in
god
or
man
or
self
say
so
if
not
push
back
upon
the
shelf
of
silence
all
your
thoughts
till
faith
shall
come
no
one
will
grieve
because
your
lips
are
dumb
talk
health
the
dreary
tale
of
mortal
maladies
is
worn
and
stale
you
can
not
charm
or
interest
or
please
by
harping
on
that
minor
chord
disease
say
you
are
well
or
all
is
well
with
you
and
god
shall
hear
your
words
and
make
them
true
footnotes
for
this
illustration
i
am

to
the

the
three
metrical

vii
the
there
the
dearest
little
old
gentleman
says
james
buckham
who
goes
into
town
every
morning
on
the
train
i
do
know
his
name
and
yet
i
know
him
better
than
anybody
else
in
town
he
just
radiates
cheerfulness
as
far
as
you
can
see
him
there
is
always
a
smile
on
his
face
and
i
never
heard
him
open
his
mouth
except
to
say
something
kind
courteous
or
good
natured
everybody
bows
to
him
even
strangers
and
he
bows
to
everybody
yet
never
with
the
slightest
hint
of
presumption
or
familiarity
if
the
weather
is
fine
his
jolly
compliments
make
it
seem
finer
and
if
it
is
raining
the
merry
way
in
which
he
speaks
of
it
is
as
good
as
a
rainbow
everybody
who
goes
in
on
the
train
knows
the
it
his
train
you
just
hurry
up
a
little
and
show
you
the
this
morning
it
foggy
and
cold
but
if
one
look
at
him
does
cheer
you
up
so
that
you
want
to
whistle
then
i
no
judge
of
human
nature
good
morning
sir
said
jolliboy
in
going
to
the
same
train
why
sir
i
do
know
you
replied
neversmile
i
did
say
you
did
sir
good
morning
sir
the
inborn
geniality
of
some
people
says
whipple
amounts
to
genius
how
in
our
troubled
lives
asks
freeman
clarke
could
we
do
without
these
fair
sunny
natures
into
which
on
their
god
allowed
nothing
sour
acrid
or
bitter
to
enter
but
made
them
a
perpetual
solace
and
comfort
by
their
cheerfulness
there
are
those
whose
very
presence
carries
sunshine
with
them
wherever
they
go
a
sunshine
which
means
pity
for
the
poor
sympathy
for
the
suffering
help
for
the
unfortunate
and
benignity
toward
all
everybody
loves
the
sunny
soul
his
very
face
is
a
passport
anywhere
all
doors
fly
open
to
him
he
disarms
prejudice
and
envy
for
he
bears
good
will
to
everybody
he
is
as
welcome
in
every
household
as
the
sunshine
he
was
quiet
cheerful
genial
says
carlyle
in
his
reminiscences
concerning
edward
irving
sunny
helpfulness
his
soul
unruffled
clear
as
a
mirror
honestly
loving
and
loved
irving
voice
was
to
me
one
of
blessedness
and
new
hope
and
to
william
wilberforce
the
poet
southey
paid
this
tribute
i
never
saw
any
other
man
who
seemed
to
enjoy
such
perpetual
serenity
and
sunshine
of
spirit
i
resolved
said
tom
hood
that
like
the
sun
so
long
as
my
day
lasted
i
would
look
on
the
bright
side
of
everything
when
goldsmith
was
in
flanders
he
discovered
the
happiest
man
he
had
ever
seen
at
his
toil
from
morning
till
night
he
was
full
of
song
and
laughter
yet
this
being
was
a
slave
maimed
deformed
and
wearing
a
chain
how
well
he
illustrated
that
saying
which
bids
us
if
there
is
no
bright
side
to
polish
up
the
dark
one
mirth
is
like
the
flash
of
lightning
that
breaks
through
the
gloom
of
the
clouds
and
glitters
for
a
moment
cheerfulness
keeps
up
a
daylight
in
the
soul
filling
it
with
a
steady
and
perpetual
serenity
it
is
cheerfulness
that
has
the
staying
quality
like
the
sunshine
changing
a
world
of
gloom
into
a
paradise
of
beauty
the
first
prize
at
a
was
taken
by
a
pale
sickly
little
girl
who
lived
in
a
close
dark
court
in
the
east
of
london
the
judges
asked
how
she
could
grow
it
in
such
a
dingy
and
sunless
place
she
replied
that
a
little
ray
of
sunlight
came
into
the
court
as
soon
as
it
appeared
in
the
morning
she
put
her
flower
beneath
it
and
as
it
moved
moved
the
flower
so
that
she
kept
it
in
the
sunlight
all
day
water
air
and
sunshine
the
three
greatest
hygienic
agents
are
free
and
within
the
reach
of
all
twelve
years
ago
says
walt
whitman
i
came
to
camden
to
die
but
every
day
i
went
into
the
country
and
bathed
in
the
sunshine
lived
with
the
birds
and
squirrels
and
played
in
the
water
with
the
fishes
i
received
my
health
from
nature
it
is
the
unqualified
result
of
all
my
experience
with
the
sick
said
florence
nightingale
that
second
only
to
their
need
of
fresh
air
is
their
need
of
light
that
after
a
close
room
what
most
hurts
them
is
a
dark
room
and
that
it
is
not
only
light
but
direct
sunshine
they
want
sunlight
says
curtis
in
health
culture
has
much
to
do
in
keeping
air
in
a
healthy
condition
no
plant
can
grow
in
the
dark
neither
can
man
remain
healthy
in
a
dark
room
when
the
first
asylum
for
the
blind
was
erected
in
massachusetts
the
committee
decided
to
save
expense
by
not
having
any
windows
they
reasoned
that
as
the
patients
could
not
see
there
was
no
need
of
any
light
it
was
built
without
windows
but
ventilation
was
well
provided
for
and
the
poor
sightless
patients
were
domiciled
in
the
house
but
things
did
not
go
well
one
after
another
began
to
sicken
and
great
languor
fell
upon
them
they
felt
distressed
and
restless
craving
something
they
hardly
knew
what
after
two
had
died
and
all
were
ill
the
committee
decided
to
have
windows
the
sunlight
poured
in
and
the
white
faces
recovered
their
color
their
flagging
energies
and
depressed
spirits
revived
and
health
was
restored
the
sun
making
all
living
things
to
grow
exerts
its
happiest
influence
in
cheering
the
mind
of
man
and
making
his
heart
glad
and
if
a
man
has
sunshine
in
his
soul
he
will
go
on
his
way
rejoicing
content
to
look
forward
if
under
a
cloud
not
bating
one
jot
of
heart
or
hope
if
for
a
moment
cast
down
honoring
his
occupation
whatever
it
be
rendering
even
rags
respectable
by
the
way
he
wears
them
and
not
only
happy
himself
but
giving
happiness
to
others
how
a
man
face
shines
when
illuminated
by
a
great
moral
motive
and
his
manner
too
is
touched
with
the
grace
of
light
nothing
will
supply
the
want
of
sunshine
to
peaches
said
emerson
and
to
make
knowledge
valuable
you
must
have
the
cheerfulness
of
wisdom
wondrous
is
the
strength
of
cheerfulness
said
carlyle
altogether
past
calculation
its
powers
of
endurance
efforts
to
be
permanently
useful
must
be
uniformly
joyous
a
spirit
all
sunshine
graceful
from
very
gladness
beautiful
because
bright
the
cheerful
man
carries
with
him
perpetually
in
his
presence
and
personality
an
influence
that
acts
upon
others
as
summer
warmth
on
the
fields
and
forests
it
wakes
up
and
calls
out
the
best
that
is
in
them
it
makes
them
stronger
braver
and
happier
such
a
man
makes
a
little
spot
of
this
world
a
lighter
brighter
warmer
place
for
other
people
to
live
in
to
meet
him
in
the
morning
is
to
get
inspiration
which
makes
all
the
day
struggles
and
tasks
easier
his
hearty
handshake
puts
a
thrill
of
new
vigor
into
your
veins
after
talking
with
him
for
a
few
minutes
you
feel
an
exhilaration
of
spirits
a
quickening
of
energy
a
renewal
of
zest
and
interest
in
living
and
are
ready
for
any
duty
or
service
great
hearts
there
are
among
men
says
hillis
of
plymouth
pulpit
they
carry
a
volume
of
manhood
their
presence
is
sunshine
their
coming
changes
our
climate
they
oil
the
bearings
of
life
their
shadow
always
falls
behind
them
they
make
right
living
easy
blessed
are
the
they
represent
the
best
forces
in
civilization
if
refined
manners
reprove
us
a
little
for
laughter
a
smiling
face
kindled
by
a
smiling
heart
is
always
in
order
who
can
ever
forget
emerson
smile
it
was
a
perpetual
benediction
upon
all
who
knew
him
a
smile
is
said
to
be
to
the
human
countenance
what
sunshine
is
to
the
landscape
or
a
smile
is
called
the
rainbow
of
the
face
this
is
a
dark
world
to
many
people
says
a
suggestive
modern
writer
a
world
of
chills
a
world
of
fogs
a
world
of
wet
blankets
of
the
men
we
meet
need
encouragement
your
work
is
so
urgent
that
you
have
no
time
to
stop
and
speak
to
the
people
but
every
day
you
meet
scores
perhaps
hundreds
and
thousands
of
persons
upon
whom
you
might
have
direct
and
immediate
influence
how
you
cry
out
we
answer
by
the
grace
of
physiognomy
there
is
nothing
more
catching
than
a
face
with
a
lantern
behind
it
shining
clear
through
we
have
no
admiration
for
a
face
with
a
dry
smile
meaning
no
more
than
the
grin
of
a
false
face
but
a
smile
written
by
the
hand
of
god
as
an
index
finger
or
table
of
contents
to
whole
volumes
of
good
feeling
within
is
a
benediction
you
say
face
is
hard
and
lacking
in
mobility
and
my
benignant
feelings
are
not
observable
in
the
facial
proportions
we
do
not
believe
you
freshness
and
geniality
of
the
soul
are
so
subtle
and
pervading
that
they
will
at
some
eye
or
mouth
corner
leak
out
set
behind
your
face
a
feeling
of
gratitude
to
god
and
kindliness
toward
man
and
you
will
every
day
preach
a
sermon
long
as
the
streets
you
walk
a
sermon
with
as
many
heads
as
the
number
of
people
you
meet
and
differing
from
other
sermons
in
the
fact
that
the
longer
it
is
the
better
the
reason
that
there
are
so
many
sour
faces
so
many
frowning
faces
so
many
dull
faces
is
because
men
consent
to
be
acrid
and
petulant
and
stupid
the
way
to
improve
your
face
is
to
improve
your
disposition
attractiveness
of
physiognomy
does
not
depend
on
regularity
of
features
we
know
persons
whose
brows
are
shaggy
eyes
oblique
noses
ominously
longitudinal
and
mouths
straggling
along
in
unusual
and
unexpected
directions
and
yet
they
are
men
and
women
of
so
much
soul
that
we
love
to
look
upon
them
and
their
faces
are
sweet
evangels
it
was
willis
i
think
who
added
to
the
beatitudes
blessed
are
the
and
this
is
why
all
the
world
loves
little
children
who
are
always
ready
to
have
sunshine
party
little
children
bubbling
over
with
fun
as
a
bobolink
with
song
how
well
we
remember
it
all
the
long
gone
years
of
our
own
childhood
and
the
households
of
joyous
children
we
have
known
in
later
years
are
the
children
still
some
of
them
in
unending
scenes
of
light
i
saw
but
yesterday
this
epitaph
at
mount
auburn
was
so
pleasant
in
life
and
now
alive
forever
more
in
light
supernal
how
can
we
then
but
rejoice
with
joy
unspeakable
as
the
children
of
immortality
living
habitually
above
the
gloom
and
damps
of
earth
and
leading
lives
of
ministration
bestowing
everywhere
sweetness
and
light
radiating
upon
the
earth
something
of
the
beauty
of
the
unseen
world
what
is
a
sunny
temper
but
a
talisman
more
powerful
than
wealth
more
precious
than
rubies
what
is
it
but
an
aroma
whose
fragrance
fills
the
air
with
the
odors
of
paradise
i
am
so
full
of
happiness
said
a
little
child
that
i
could
not
be
any
happier
unless
i
could
grow
and
she
bade
good
morning
to
her
sweet
singing
bird
and
good
morning
to
the
sun
then
she
asked
her
mother
permission
and
softly
reverently
gladly
bade
good
morning
to
god
and
why
should
she
not
was
it
not
goethe
who
represented
a
journey
that
followed
the
sunshine
round
the
world
forever
bathed
in
light
and
longfellow
sang
is
always
morning
somewhere
and
above
the
awakening
continents
from
shore
to
shore
somewhere
the
birds
are
singing
evermore
the
darkness
past
we
mount
the
radiant
skies
and
changeless
day
is
ours
we
hear
the
songs
of
higher
spheres
the
light
divine
our
eyes
behold
and
sunlight
robes
of
countless
throngs
who
dwell
in
light
we
seek
with
joyous
quest
god
service
sweet
to
wipe
all
tears
away
and
list
we
every
hour
with
eager
zest
for
high
command
to
toils
that
god
has
blest
so
fill
we
full
our
endless
sunshine
day
