mohammed
the
most
extraordinary
man
who
arose
after
the
fall
of
the
roman
empire
was
doubtless
mohammed
and
his
posthumous
influence
has
been
greater
than
that
of
any
man
since
christianity
was
declared
if
we
take
into
account
the
number
of
those
who
have
received
his
doctrines
even
christianity
never
had
so
rapid
a
spread
more
than
a
sixth
part
of
the
human
race
are
the
professed
followers
of
the
arabian
prophet
in
regard
to
mohammed
himself
a
great
change
has
taken
place
in
the
opinions
of
critics
within
fifty
years
it
was
the
fashion
half
a
century
ago
to
speak
of
this
man
as
a
hypocrite
an
impostor
even
as
antichrist
now
he
is
generally
regarded
as
a
reformer
that
is
as
a
man
who
introduced
into
arabia
a
religion
and
a
morality
superior
to
what
previously
existed
and
he
is
regarded
as
an
impostor
only
so
far
as
he
was
visionary
few
critics
doubt
his
sincerity
he
was
no
hypocrite
since
he
himself
believed
in
his
mission
and
his
mission
was
benevolent
to
turn
his
countrymen
from
a
gross
polytheism
to
the
worship
of
one
god
although
his
religion
can
not
compare
with
christianity
in
purity
and
loftiness
yet
it
enforced
a
higher
morality
than
the
old
arabian
religions
and
assimilated
to
christianity
in
many
important
respects
the
chief
fault
we
have
to
find
in
mohammed
was
the
propagation
of
his
doctrines
by
the
sword
and
the
use
of
wicked
means
to
bring
about
a
good
end
the
truths
he
declared
have
had
an
immense
influence
on
asiatic
nations
and
these
have
given
vitality
to
his
system
if
we
accept
the
position
that
truth
alone
has
vitality
one
remarkable
fact
stands
out
for
the
world
to
ponder
that
for
more
than
fourteen
hundred
years
one
hundred
and
eighty
millions
more
than
a
sixth
part
of
the
human
race
have
adopted
and
cherished
the
religion
of
mohammed
that
christianity
never
had
so
astonishing
a
triumph
and
that
even
the
adherents
of
christianity
in
many
countries
have
not
manifested
the
zeal
of
the
mohammedans
in
most
of
the
countries
where
it
has
been
acknowledged
now
these
startling
facts
can
be
explained
only
on
the
ground
that
mohammedanism
has
great
vital
religious
and
moral
truths
underlying
its
system
which
appeal
to
the
consciousness
of
mankind
or
else
that
these
truths
are
so
blended
with
dangerous
errors
which
appeal
to
depraved
passions
and
interests
that
the
religion
spread
in
consequence
of
these
errors
rather
than
of
the
truth
itself
the
question
to
be
considered
then
is
whether
mohammedanism
spread
in
consequence
of
its
truths
or
in
consequence
of
its
errors
in
order
to
appreciate
the
influence
of
the
arabian
prophet
we
are
first
led
into
the
inquiry
whether
his
religion
was
really
an
improvement
on
the
old
systems
which
previously
prevailed
in
arabia
if
it
was
he
must
be
regarded
as
a
benefactor
and
reformer
even
if
we
admit
the
glaring
evils
of
his
system
when
measured
by
the
purer
religion
of
the
cross
and
it
then
simply
becomes
a
question
whether
it
is
better
to
have
a
prevalent
corrupted
system
of
religion
containing
many
important
truths
or
a
system
of
downright
paganism
with
few
truths
at
all
in
examining
the
religious
systems
of
arabia
in
the
age
preceding
the
advent
of
the
prophet
it
would
seem
that
the
most
prominent
of
them
were
the
old
doctrines
of
the
magians
and
sabaeans
blended
with
a
gross
idolatry
and
a
senseless
polytheism
whatever
may
have
been
the
faith
of
the
ancient
sabaean
sages
who
noted
the
aspects
of
the
stars
and
supposed
they
were
inhabited
by
angels
placed
there
by
almighty
power
to
supervise
and
govern
the
universe
yet
history
seems
to
record
that
this
ancient
faith
was
practically
subverted
and
that
the
stars
where
were
supposed
to
dwell
deities
to
whom
prayers
were
made
became
themselves
objects
of
worship
and
even
graven
images
were
made
in
honor
of
them
among
the
arabs
each
tribe
worshipped
a
particular
star
and
set
up
its
particular
idol
so
that
a
degrading
polytheism
was
the
religion
of
the
land
the
object
of
greatest
veneration
was
the
celebrated
black
stone
at
mecca
fabled
to
have
fallen
from
heaven
at
the
same
time
with
adam
over
this
stone
was
built
the
kaabah
a
small
oblong
stone
building
around
which
has
been
since
built
the
great
mosque
it
was
ornamented
with
three
hundred
and
sixty
idols
the
guardianship
of
this
pagan
temple
was
intrusted
to
the
most
ancient
and
honorable
families
of
mecca
and
to
it
resorted
innumerable
pilgrims
bringing
precious
offerings
it
was
like
the
shrine
of
delphi
as
a
source
of
profit
to
its
fortunate
guardians
thus
before
mohammed
appeared
polytheism
was
the
prevalent
religion
of
arabia
a
degradation
even
from
the
ancient
sabaean
faith
it
is
true
there
were
also
other
religions
there
were
many
jews
at
medina
and
there
was
also
a
corrupted
form
of
christianity
in
many
places
split
up
into
hostile
and
wrangling
sects
with
but
little
of
the
spirit
of
the
divine
founder
with
innumerable
errors
and
superstitions
so
that
in
no
part
of
the
world
was
christianity
so
feeble
a
light
but
the
great
body
of
the
people
were
pagans
a
marked
reform
was
imperatively
needed
to
restore
the
belief
in
the
unity
of
god
and
set
up
a
higher
standard
of
morality
it
is
claimed
that
mohammed
brought
such
a
reform
he
was
born
in
the
year
of
the
family
of
hashem
and
the
tribe
of
koreish
to
whom
was
intrusted
the
keeping
of
the
black
stone
he
therefore
belonged
to
the
highest
arabian
aristocracy
early
left
an
orphan
and
in
poverty
he
was
reared
in
the
family
of
one
of
his
uncles
under
all
the
influences
of
idolatry
this
uncle
was
a
merchant
and
the
youth
made
long
journeys
with
him
to
distant
fairs
especially
in
syria
where
he
probably
became
acquainted
with
the
holy
scriptures
especially
with
the
old
testament
in
his
year
he
entered
the
service
of
cadijeh
a
very
wealthy
widow
who
sent
to
the
fairs
and
towns
great
caravans
which
mohammed
accompanied
in
some
humble
capacity
according
to
the
tradition
as
but
his
personal
beauty
which
was
remarkable
and
probably
also
his
intelligence
and
spirit
won
the
heart
of
this
powerful
mistress
and
she
became
his
wife
he
was
now
second
to
none
in
the
capital
of
arabia
and
great
thoughts
began
to
fill
his
soul
his
wife
perceived
his
greatness
and
like
josephine
and
the
wife
of
disraeli
forwarded
the
fortunes
of
her
husband
for
he
became
rich
as
well
as
intellectual
and
noble
and
thus
had
time
and
leisure
to
accomplish
more
easily
his
work
from
to
forty
he
led
chiefly
a
contemplative
life
spending
months
together
in
a
cave
absorbed
in
his
grand
reflections
at
intervals
issuing
from
his
retreat
visiting
the
marts
of
commerce
and
gaining
knowledge
from
learned
men
it
is
seldom
that
very
great
men
lead
either
a
life
of
perpetual
contemplation
or
of
perpetual
activity
without
occasional
rest
and
leisure
to
mature
knowledge
no
man
can
arm
himself
with
the
weapons
of
the
gods
to
be
truly
great
a
man
must
blend
a
life
of
activity
with
a
life
of
study
like
moses
who
matured
the
knowledge
he
had
gained
in
egypt
amid
the
deserts
of
midian
with
all
great
men
some
leading
idea
rules
the
ordinary
life
the
idea
which
took
possession
of
the
mind
of
mohammed
was
the
degrading
polytheism
of
his
countrymen
the
multitude
of
their
idols
the
grossness
of
their
worship
and
the
degrading
morals
which
usually
accompany
a
false
theology
he
set
himself
to
work
to
produce
a
reform
but
amid
overwhelming
obstacles
he
talked
with
his
uncles
and
they
laughed
at
him
they
would
not
even
admit
the
necessity
of
a
reform
only
cadijeh
listened
to
him
and
encouraged
him
and
believed
in
him
and
mohammed
was
ever
grateful
for
this
mark
of
confidence
and
cherished
the
memory
of
his
wife
in
his
subsequent
apostasy
if
it
be
true
that
he
fell
like
solomon
long
afterwards
when
she
was
dead
ay√©sha
his
young
and
favorite
wife
thus
addressed
him
am
i
not
better
than
cadijeh
do
you
not
love
me
better
than
you
did
her
she
was
a
widow
old
and
ugly
no
by
allah
replied
the
prophet
she
believed
in
me
when
no
one
else
did
in
the
whole
world
i
had
but
one
friend
and
she
was
that
friend
no
woman
ever
retained
the
affections
of
a
husband
superior
to
herself
unless
she
had
the
spirit
of
cadijeh
unless
she
proved
herself
his
friend
and
believed
in
him
how
miserable
the
life
of
jane
carlyle
would
have
been
had
she
not
been
proud
of
her
husband
one
reason
why
there
is
frequent
unhappiness
in
married
life
is
because
there
is
no
mutual
appreciation
how
often
have
we
seen
a
noble
lofty
earnest
man
fettered
and
chained
by
a
frivolous
woman
who
could
not
be
made
to
see
the
dignity
and
importance
of
the
labors
which
gave
to
her
husband
all
his
real
power
not
so
with
the
woman
who
assisted
mohammed
without
her
sympathy
and
faith
he
probably
would
have
failed
he
told
her
and
her
alone
his
dreams
his
ecstasies
his
visions
how
that
god
at
different
times
had
sent
prophets
and
teachers
to
reveal
new
truths
by
whom
religion
had
been
restored
how
this
one
god
who
created
the
heavens
and
the
earth
had
never
left
himself
without
witnesses
of
his
truth
in
the
most
degenerate
times
how
that
the
universal
recognition
of
this
sovereign
power
and
providence
was
necessary
to
the
salvation
of
society
he
had
learned
much
from
the
study
of
the
talmud
and
the
jewish
scriptures
he
had
reflected
deeply
in
his
isolated
cave
he
knew
that
there
was
but
one
supreme
god
and
that
there
could
be
no
elevated
morality
without
the
sense
of
personal
responsibility
to
him
that
without
the
fear
of
this
one
god
there
could
be
neither
wisdom
nor
virtue
hence
his
soul
burned
to
tell
his
countrymen
his
earnest
belief
in
a
supreme
and
personal
god
to
whom
alone
prayers
should
be
made
and
who
alone
could
rescue
by
his
almighty
power
he
pondered
day
and
night
on
this
single
and
simple
truth
his
perpetual
meditations
and
ascetic
habits
induced
dreams
and
ecstasies
such
as
marked
primitive
monks
and
loyola
in
his
manresan
cave
he
became
a
visionary
man
but
most
intensely
earnest
for
his
convictions
were
overwhelming
he
fancied
himself
the
ambassador
of
this
god
as
the
ancient
jewish
prophets
were
that
he
was
even
greater
than
they
his
mission
being
to
remove
idolatry
to
his
mind
the
greatest
evil
under
the
sun
since
it
was
the
root
of
all
vices
and
follies
idolatry
is
either
a
defiance
or
a
forgetfulness
of
god
high
treason
to
the
majesty
of
heaven
entailing
the
direst
calamities
at
last
one
day
in
his
fortieth
year
after
he
had
been
shut
up
a
whole
month
in
solitude
so
that
his
soul
was
filled
with
ecstasy
and
enthusiasm
he
declared
to
cadijeh
that
the
night
before
while
wrapped
in
his
mantle
absorbed
in
reverie
a
form
of
divine
beauty
in
a
flood
of
light
appeared
to
him
and
in
the
name
of
the
almighty
who
created
the
heavens
and
the
earth
thus
spake
o
mohammed
of
a
truth
thou
art
the
prophet
of
god
and
i
am
his
angel
gabriel
this
says
carlyle
is
the
soul
of
islam
this
is
what
mohammed
felt
and
now
declared
to
be
of
infinite
moment
that
idols
and
formulas
were
nothing
that
the
jargon
of
argumentative
greek
sects
the
vague
traditions
of
jews
the
stupid
routine
of
arab
idolatry
were
a
mockery
and
a
delusion
that
there
is
but
one
god
that
we
must
let
idols
alone
and
look
to
him
he
alone
is
reality
he
made
us
and
sustains
us
our
whole
strength
lies
in
submission
to
him
the
thing
he
sends
us
be
it
death
even
is
good
is
the
best
we
resign
ourselves
to
him
such
were
the
truths
which
mohammed
with
preternatural
earnestness
now
declared
doctrines
which
would
revolutionize
arabia
and
why
not
they
are
the
same
substantially
which
moses
declared
to
those
sensual
and
degraded
slaves
whom
he
led
out
of
egypt
yea
the
doctrines
of
david
and
of
job
though
he
slay
me
yet
will
i
trust
in
him
what
a
grand
and
truth
it
is
to
impress
upon
people
sunk
in
forgetfulness
and
sensuality
and
and
idle
schemes
of
vanity
and
ambition
that
there
is
a
supreme
intelligence
who
overrules
and
whose
laws
can
not
be
violated
with
impunity
from
whom
no
one
can
escape
even
though
he
take
the
wings
of
the
morning
and
fly
to
the
uttermost
parts
of
the
sea
this
is
the
one
truth
that
moses
sought
to
plant
in
the
minds
of
the
jews
a
truth
always
forgotten
when
there
is
slavery
to
epicurean
pleasures
or
a
false
philosophy
now
i
maintain
that
mohammed
in
seeking
to
impress
his
degenerate
countrymen
with
the
idea
of
the
one
supreme
god
amid
a
most
degrading
and
almost
universal
polytheism
was
a
great
reformer
in
preaching
this
he
was
neither
fanatic
nor
hypocrite
he
was
a
very
great
man
and
thus
far
a
good
man
he
does
not
make
an
original
revelation
he
reproduces
an
old
truth
as
old
as
the
patriarchs
as
old
as
job
as
old
as
the
primitive
religions
but
an
exceedingly
important
one
lost
sight
of
by
his
countrymen
gradually
lost
sight
of
by
all
peoples
when
divine
grace
is
withheld
indeed
practically
by
people
in
christian
lands
in
times
of
great
degeneracy
the
fool
has
said
in
his
heart
there
is
no
god
or
let
there
be
no
god
that
we
may
eat
and
drink
before
we
die
epicureanism
in
its
pleasures
or
in
its
speculations
is
virtually
atheism
it
was
so
in
greece
it
is
so
with
us
mohammed
was
now
at
the
mature
age
of
forty
in
the
fulness
of
his
powers
in
the
prime
of
his
life
and
he
began
to
preach
everywhere
that
there
is
but
one
god
few
however
believed
in
him
why
not
acknowledge
such
a
fundamental
truth
appealing
to
the
intellect
as
well
as
the
moral
sense
but
to
confess
there
is
a
supreme
god
who
rewards
and
punishes
and
to
whom
all
are
responsible
both
for
words
and
actions
is
to
imply
a
confession
of
sinfulness
and
the
justice
of
retribution
those
degraded
arabians
would
not
receive
willingly
such
a
truth
as
this
even
as
the
israelites
ever
sought
to
banish
it
from
their
hearts
and
minds
in
spite
of
their
deliverance
from
slavery
the
uncles
and
friends
of
mohammed
treated
his
mission
with
scorn
and
derision
nor
do
i
read
that
the
common
people
heard
him
gladly
as
they
listened
to
the
teachings
of
christ
zealously
he
labored
for
three
years
with
all
classes
and
yet
in
three
years
of
exalted
labor
with
all
his
eloquence
and
fervor
and
sincerity
he
converted
only
about
thirteen
persons
one
of
whom
was
his
slave
think
of
such
a
man
declaring
such
a
truth
and
only
gaining
thirteen
followers
in
three
years
how
sickened
must
have
been
his
enthusiastic
soul
his
worldly
relatives
urged
him
to
silence
why
attack
idols
why
quarrel
with
his
own
interests
why
destroy
his
popularity
then
exclaimed
that
great
hero
if
the
sun
stood
on
my
right
hand
and
the
moon
on
my
left
ordering
me
to
hold
my
peace
i
would
still
declare
there
is
but
one
god
a
speech
rivalled
only
by
luther
at
the
diet
of
worms
why
urge
a
great
man
to
be
silent
on
the
very
thing
which
makes
him
great
he
can
not
be
silent
his
truth
from
which
he
can
not
be
separated
is
greater
than
life
or
death
or
principalities
or
powers
buffeted
and
ridiculed
still
mohammed
persevered
he
used
at
first
only
moral
means
he
appealed
only
to
the
minds
and
hearts
of
the
people
encouraged
by
his
few
believers
and
sustained
by
the
fancied
voice
of
that
angel
who
appeared
to
him
in
his
retreat
but
his
earnest
voice
was
drowned
by
discordant
noises
he
was
regarded
as
a
lunatic
a
demented
man
because
he
professed
to
believe
in
a
personal
god
the
angry
mob
covered
his
clothes
with
dust
and
ashes
they
demanded
miracles
but
at
this
time
he
had
only
truths
to
declare
those
saving
truths
which
are
perpetual
miracles
at
last
hostilities
began
he
was
threatened
and
he
was
persecuted
they
laid
plots
to
take
his
life
he
sought
shelter
in
the
castle
of
his
uncle
abu
taleh
but
he
died
then
mohammed
wife
cadijeh
died
the
priests
of
an
idolatrous
religion
became
furious
he
had
laid
his
hands
on
their
idols
he
was
regarded
as
a
disorganizer
an
innovator
a
most
dangerous
man
his
fortunes
became
darker
and
darker
he
was
hated
persecuted
and
alone
thus
thirteen
years
passed
away
in
reproach
in
persecution
in
fear
at
last
forty
picked
men
swore
to
assassinate
him
should
he
remain
at
mecca
and
die
before
his
mission
was
accomplished
or
should
he
fly
he
concluded
to
fly
to
medina
where
there
were
jews
and
some
nominal
converts
to
christianity
a
new
ground
this
was
in
the
year
and
the
flight
is
called
the
hegira
from
which
the
east
dates
its
era
in
the
year
of
the
prophet
life
in
this
city
he
was
cordially
welcomed
and
he
soon
found
himself
surrounded
with
enthusiastic
followers
he
built
a
mosque
and
openly
performed
the
rites
of
the
new
religion
at
this
era
a
new
phase
appears
in
the
prophet
life
and
teachings
thus
far
until
his
flight
it
would
seem
that
he
propagated
his
doctrines
by
moral
force
alone
and
that
these
doctrines
in
the
main
were
elevated
he
had
earnestly
declared
his
great
idea
of
the
unity
of
god
he
had
pronounced
the
worship
of
images
to
be
idolatrous
he
held
idolatry
of
all
kinds
in
supreme
abhorrence
he
enjoined
charity
justice
and
forbearance
he
denounced
all
falsehood
and
all
deception
especially
in
trade
he
declared
that
humility
benevolence
and
were
the
greatest
virtues
he
commanded
his
disciples
to
return
good
for
evil
to
restrain
the
passions
to
bridle
the
tongue
to
be
patient
under
injuries
to
be
submissive
to
god
he
enjoined
prayer
fastings
and
meditation
as
a
means
of
grace
he
laid
down
the
necessity
of
rest
on
the
seventh
day
he
copied
the
precepts
of
the
bible
in
many
of
their
essential
features
and
recognized
its
greatest
teachers
as
inspired
prophets
it
was
during
these
thirteen
years
at
mecca
amid
persecution
and
ridicule
and
with
few
outward
successes
that
he
probably
wrote
the
koran
a
book
without
beginning
and
without
end
regardless
of
all
rules
of
art
full
of
repetitions
and
yet
full
of
lofty
precepts
and
noble
truths
of
morality
evidently
borrowed
from
the
jewish
scriptures
in
which
his
great
ideas
stand
out
with
singular
eloquence
and
impressiveness
the
unity
of
god
his
divine
sovereignty
the
necessity
of
prayer
the
soul
immortality
future
rewards
and
punishments
his
own
private
life
had
been
blameless
it
was
plain
and
simple
for
a
whole
month
he
did
not
light
a
fire
to
cook
his
food
he
swept
his
chamber
himself
and
mended
his
own
clothes
his
life
was
that
of
an
ascetic
enthusiast
profoundly
impressed
with
the
greatness
and
dignity
of
his
mission
thus
far
his
greatest
error
and
fault
was
in
the
supposition
that
he
was
inspired
in
the
same
sense
as
the
ancient
jewish
prophets
were
inspired
to
declare
the
will
and
the
truth
of
god
any
man
leading
such
a
life
of
contemplative
asceticism
and
retirement
is
prone
to
fall
into
the
belief
of
special
divine
illumination
it
characterized
george
fox
the
anabaptists
ignatius
loyola
saint
theresa
and
even
to
some
extent
oliver
cromwell
himself
supreme
error
was
that
he
was
the
greatest
as
well
as
the
last
of
the
prophets
this
was
fanaticism
but
he
was
probably
honest
in
the
belief
his
brain
was
turned
by
dreams
ecstasies
and
ascetic
devotions
but
with
all
his
visionary
ideas
of
his
call
his
own
morality
and
his
teachings
had
been
lofty
and
apparently
unsuccessful
possibly
he
was
discouraged
with
the
small
progress
he
had
made
disgusted
irritated
fierce
certainly
soon
after
he
was
established
at
medina
a
great
change
took
place
in
his
mode
of
propagating
his
doctrines
his
great
ideas
remained
the
same
but
he
adopted
a
new
way
to
spread
them
so
that
i
can
almost
fancy
that
some
mephistopheles
some
form
of
satanic
agency
some
lying
voice
whispered
to
him
in
this
wise
o
mohammed
of
a
truth
thou
art
the
prophet
of
the
living
god
thou
hast
declared
the
grandest
truths
ever
uttered
in
arabia
but
see
how
powerless
they
are
on
the
minds
and
hearts
of
thy
countrymen
with
all
thy
eloquence
sincerity
and
fervor
by
moral
means
thou
hast
effected
comparatively
nothing
thou
hast
preached
thirteen
years
and
only
made
a
few
converts
thy
truths
are
too
elevated
for
a
corrupt
and
wicked
generation
to
accept
even
thine
own
life
is
in
danger
thou
hast
been
obliged
to
fly
to
these
barren
rocks
and
sands
thou
hast
failed
why
not
pursue
a
new
course
and
adapt
thy
doctrines
to
men
as
they
are
thy
countrymen
are
wild
fierce
and
warlike
why
not
incite
their
martial
passions
in
defence
of
thy
doctrines
they
are
an
earnest
people
and
believing
in
the
truths
which
thou
now
declarest
they
will
fight
for
them
and
establish
them
by
the
sword
not
merely
in
arabia
but
throughout
the
east
they
are
a
and
imaginative
people
why
not
promise
the
victors
of
thy
faith
a
sensual
bliss
in
paradise
they
will
not
be
subverters
of
your
grand
truths
they
will
simply
extend
them
and
jealously
if
they
have
a
reward
in
what
their
passions
crave
in
short
use
the
proper
means
for
a
great
end
the
end
justifies
the
means
whether
influenced
by
such
specious
sophistries
or
disheartened
by
his
former
method
or
corrupted
in
his
own
heart
as
solomon
was
by
his
numerous
wives
for
mohammed
permitted
polygamy
and
practised
it
himself
it
is
certain
that
he
now
was
bent
on
achieving
more
signal
and
rapid
victories
he
resolved
to
adapt
his
religion
to
the
depraved
hearts
of
his
followers
he
would
mix
up
truth
with
error
he
would
make
truth
palatable
he
would
use
the
means
which
secure
success
it
was
success
he
wanted
and
success
he
thus
far
had
not
secured
he
was
ambitious
he
would
become
a
mighty
spiritual
potentate
so
he
allowed
polygamy
the
vice
of
eastern
nations
from
remote
periods
he
promised
a
sensual
paradise
to
those
who
should
die
in
defence
of
his
religion
he
inflamed
the
imagination
of
the
arabians
with
visions
of
sensual
joys
he
painted
heaven
as
a
land
whose
soil
was
the
finest
wheaten
flour
whose
air
was
fragrant
with
perfumes
whose
streams
were
of
crystal
water
or
milk
or
wine
or
honey
flowing
over
beds
of
musk
and
camphor
a
glorious
garden
of
fruits
and
flowers
whose
inhabitants
were
clothed
in
garments
of
gold
sparkling
with
rubies
and
diamonds
who
reclined
in
sumptuous
palaces
and
silken
pavilions
and
on
couches
of
voluptuous
ease
and
who
were
served
with
viands
which
could
be
eaten
without
satiety
and
liquors
which
could
be
drunk
without
inebriation
yea
where
the
blissful
warrior
for
the
faith
should
enjoy
an
unending
youth
and
where
he
would
be
attended
by
houris
with
black
and
loving
eyes
free
from
all
defects
resplendent
in
beauty
and
grace
and
rejoicing
in
perpetual
charms
such
were
the
views
it
is
maintained
with
which
he
inflamed
the
faithful
and
more
he
encouraged
them
to
take
up
arms
and
penetrate
as
warlike
missionaries
to
the
utmost
bounds
of
the
habitable
world
in
order
to
convert
men
to
the
faith
of
the
one
god
whose
prophet
he
claimed
to
be
moreover
he
made
new
and
extraordinary
revelations
that
he
had
ascended
into
the
seventh
heaven
and
held
converse
with
gabriel
and
he
now
added
to
his
creed
that
old
lie
of
eastern
theogonies
that
base
element
of
all
false
religions
that
man
can
propitiate
the
deity
by
works
of
supererogation
that
man
can
purchase
by
ascetic
labors
and
sacrifices
his
future
salvation
this
falsity
enters
largely
into
mohammedanism
i
need
not
add
how
discrepant
it
is
with
the
cheerful
teachings
of
the
apostles
especially
to
the
poor
as
seen
in
the
deeds
of
penance
prayers
in
the
corners
of
the
streets
the
ablutions
the
fasts
and
the
pilgrimages
to
which
the
faithful
are
exhorted
and
moreover
he
accommodated
his
fasts
and
feasts
and
holidays
and
pilgrimages
to
the
old
customs
of
the
people
thereby
teaching
lessons
of
worldly
wisdom
astarte
the
old
object
of
sabaean
idolatry
was
particularly
worshipped
on
a
friday
and
this
day
was
made
the
mohammedan
sabbath
again
the
month
rhamad√°n
from
time
immemorial
had
been
set
apart
for
fastings
this
month
the
prophet
adopted
declaring
that
in
it
he
had
received
his
first
revelations
pilgrimages
to
the
black
stone
were
favorite
forms
of
penance
and
this
was
perpetuated
in
the
pilgrimages
to
mecca
thus
it
would
appear
that
mohammed
after
his
flight
accommodated
his
doctrines
to
the
customs
and
tastes
of
his
countrymen
blending
with
the
sublime
truths
he
declared
subtile
and
pernicious
errors
the
jesuit
missionaries
did
the
same
thing
in
china
and
japan
thinking
more
of
the
number
of
their
converts
than
of
the
truth
itself
expediency
the
accepted
jesuitical
principle
of
the
end
justifying
the
means
is
seen
in
almost
everything
in
this
world
which
blazes
with
success
it
is
seen
in
politics
in
philanthropy
in
ecclesiasticism
and
in
education
there
are
political
jesuits
and
philanthropical
jesuits
and
protestant
jesuits
as
well
as
catholic
jesuits
and
mohammedan
jesuits
what
do
you
think
of
a
man
wearing
the
livery
of
a
gospel
minister
devoting
all
his
energies
to
versed
in
the
ways
of
the
heathen
chinee
ways
that
are
dark
and
tricks
that
are
vain
all
to
succeed
better
in
worldly
thrift
using
all
means
for
that
single
end
is
not
he
practically
a
jesuit
i
do
not
mean
a
catholic
jesuit
belonging
to
the
society
of
jesus
but
popularly
what
we
mean
by
a
jesuit
what
would
you
think
of
a
college
which
lowered
the
standard
of
education
in
order
to
draw
students
or
selected
as
the
guardians
of
its
higher
interests
those
men
who
would
contribute
the
most
money
to
its
funds
this
spirit
of
expediency
mohammed
entertained
and
utilized
in
order
to
gain
success
most
of
what
is
false
in
mohammedanism
is
based
on
expediency
the
end
was
not
lost
sight
of
the
conversion
of
his
countrymen
to
the
belief
in
the
unity
and
sovereignty
of
god
but
it
was
sought
by
means
which
would
make
them
fanatics
or
pharisees
he
was
not
such
a
miserable
creature
as
one
who
seeks
to
make
money
by
trading
on
the
religious
capital
of
the
community
but
he
did
adapt
his
religion
to
the
passions
and
habits
of
the
people
in
order
that
they
might
more
readily
be
led
to
accept
it
he
listened
to
that
same
wicked
voice
which
afterwards
appeared
in
the
guise
of
an
angel
of
light
to
mediaeval
ritualists
and
it
is
thus
that
satan
has
contrived
to
pervert
the
best
institutions
of
the
world
the
moment
good
men
look
to
outward
and
superficial
triumphs
to
the
disregard
of
inward
purity
that
moment
do
they
accept
the
jesuitical
lie
of
all
ages
the
end
justifies
the
means
but
the
worst
thing
which
the
prophet
did
in
order
to
gain
his
end
was
to
make
use
of
the
sword
for
thirteen
years
he
appealed
to
conscience
now
he
makes
it
an
inducement
for
men
to
fight
for
his
great
idea
different
prophets
said
he
in
his
memorable
manifesto
have
been
sent
by
god
to
illustrate
his
different
attributes
moses
his
providence
solomon
his
wisdom
christ
his
righteousness
but
i
the
last
of
the
prophets
am
sent
with
the
sword
let
those
who
promulgate
my
faith
enter
into
no
arguments
or
discussions
but
slay
all
who
refuse
obedience
whoever
fights
for
the
true
faith
whether
he
fall
or
conquer
will
assuredly
receive
a
glorious
reward
for
the
sword
is
the
key
of
heaven
all
who
draw
it
in
defence
of
the
faith
shall
receive
temporal
and
future
blessings
every
drop
of
their
blood
every
peril
and
hardship
will
be
registered
on
high
as
more
meritorious
than
fasting
or
prayer
if
they
fall
in
battle
their
sins
will
be
washed
away
and
they
shall
be
transported
into
paradise
to
revel
in
eternal
pleasures
and
in
the
arms
of
houris
thus
did
he
stimulate
the
martial
fanaticism
of
a
warlike
and
heroic
people
with
the
promise
of
future
happiness
what
a
monstrous
expediency
worse
than
all
the
combined
usurpations
of
the
popes
and
what
was
the
result
i
need
not
point
to
the
successive
conquests
of
the
saracens
with
such
a
mighty
stimulus
they
were
loyal
to
the
truth
for
which
they
fought
they
never
afterwards
became
idolaters
but
their
religion
was
built
up
on
the
miseries
of
nations
to
propagate
the
faith
of
mohammed
they
overran
the
world
never
were
conquests
more
rapid
and
more
terrible
at
first
mohammed
followers
in
medina
sallied
out
and
attacked
the
caravans
of
arabia
and
especially
all
belonging
to
mecca
the
city
which
had
rejected
him
until
all
the
various
tribes
acknowledged
the
religion
of
the
prophet
for
they
were
easily
converted
to
a
faith
which
flattered
their
predatory
inclinations
and
promised
them
future
immunities
the
first
cavalcade
which
entered
medina
with
spoils
made
mussulmans
of
all
the
inhabitants
and
gave
mohammed
the
control
of
the
city
the
battle
of
moat
gave
him
a
triumphal
entrance
into
mecca
he
soon
found
himself
the
sovereign
of
all
arabia
and
when
he
died
at
the
age
of
in
the
eleventh
year
after
his
hegira
or
flight
from
mecca
he
was
the
most
successful
founder
of
a
religion
the
world
has
known
next
to
buddha
a
religion
appealing
to
truth
alone
had
made
only
a
few
converts
in
thirteen
years
a
religion
which
appealed
to
the
sword
had
made
converts
of
a
great
nation
in
eleven
years
it
is
difficult
to
ascertain
what
the
private
life
of
the
prophet
was
in
these
years
of
dazzling
success
the
authorities
differ
some
represent
him
as
sunk
in
a
miserable
sensuality
which
shortened
his
days
but
i
think
this
statement
may
be
doubted
he
never
lost
the
veneration
of
his
countrymen
and
no
veneration
can
last
for
a
man
steeped
in
sensuality
even
solomon
lost
his
prestige
and
popularity
when
he
became
vain
and
sensual
those
who
were
nearest
to
the
prophet
reverenced
him
most
profoundly
with
his
wife
ay√©sha
he
lived
with
great
frugality
he
was
kindly
firm
in
friendship
faithful
and
tender
in
his
family
ready
to
forgive
enemies
just
in
decision
the
caliphs
who
succeeded
him
for
some
time
were
men
of
great
simplicity
and
sought
to
imitate
his
virtues
he
was
doubtless
warlike
and
fanatical
but
conquests
such
as
he
and
his
successors
made
are
incompatible
with
luxury
and
effeminacy
he
stands
arraigned
at
the
bar
of
eternal
justice
for
perverting
truth
for
blending
it
with
error
for
making
use
of
wicked
means
to
accomplish
what
he
deemed
a
great
end
i
have
no
patience
with
carlyle
great
and
venerable
as
is
his
authority
for
seeming
to
justify
mohammed
in
assuming
the
sword
i
care
little
for
the
sword
says
this
sophistical
writer
i
will
allow
a
thing
to
struggle
for
itself
in
this
world
with
any
sword
or
tongue
or
implement
it
has
or
can
lay
hold
on
what
is
better
than
itself
it
can
not
put
away
but
only
what
is
worse
in
this
great
nature
herself
is
umpire
and
can
do
no
wrong
that
is
might
makes
right
only
evil
perishes
in
the
conflict
of
principles
whatever
prevails
is
just
in
other
words
if
mohammedanism
by
any
means
it
may
choose
to
use
proves
itself
more
formidable
than
other
religions
then
it
ought
to
prevail
suppose
that
the
victories
of
the
saracens
had
extended
over
europe
as
well
as
asia
and
africa
had
not
been
arrested
by
charles
martel
would
carlyle
then
have
preferred
mohammedanism
to
the
christianity
of
degenerate
nations
was
mohammedanism
a
better
religion
than
the
christianity
which
existed
in
asia
minor
and
in
various
parts
of
the
greek
empire
in
the
sixth
and
seventh
centuries
was
it
a
good
thing
to
convert
the
church
of
saint
sophia
into
a
saracenic
mosque
and
the
city
of
the
later
christian
emperors
into
the
capital
of
the
turks
is
a
united
saracenic
empire
better
than
a
divided
wrangling
christian
empire
but
i
will
not
enter
upon
that
discussion
i
confine
myself
to
facts
it
is
certain
that
mohammedanism
by
means
of
the
sword
spread
with
marvellous
and
unprecedented
rapidity
the
successors
of
the
prophet
carried
their
conquests
even
to
india
neither
the
syrians
nor
the
egyptians
could
cope
with
men
who
felt
that
the
sacrifice
of
life
in
battle
would
secure
an
eternity
of
bliss
the
armies
of
the
greek
emperor
melted
away
before
the
generals
of
the
caliph
the
cross
waned
before
the
crescent
the
banners
of
the
moslems
floated
over
the
proudest
battlements
of
ancient
roman
grandeur
in
the
fifth
year
of
the
caliph
omar
only
seventeen
years
from
the
prophet
flight
from
mecca
the
conquest
of
syria
was
completed
the
christians
were
forbidden
to
build
churches
or
speak
openly
of
their
religion
or
sit
in
the
presence
of
a
mohammedan
or
to
sell
wine
or
bear
arms
or
use
the
saddle
in
riding
or
have
a
domestic
who
had
been
in
the
mohammedan
service
the
utter
prostration
of
all
civil
and
religious
liberty
took
place
in
the
old
scenes
of
christian
triumph
this
was
an
instance
in
which
persecution
proved
successful
and
because
it
was
successful
it
is
a
proof
in
the
eyes
of
carlyle
that
the
persecuting
religion
was
the
better
because
it
was
outwardly
the
stronger
the
conquest
of
egypt
rapidly
followed
that
of
syria
and
with
the
fall
of
alexandria
perished
the
largest
library
of
the
world
the
thesaurus
of
all
the
intellectual
treasures
of
antiquity
then
followed
the
conquest
of
persia
a
single
battle
as
in
the
time
of
alexander
decided
its
fate
the
marvel
is
that
the
people
should
have
changed
their
religion
but
then
it
was
mohammedanism
or
death
and
a
still
greater
marvel
it
is
an
utter
mystery
to
me
why
that
oriental
country
should
have
continued
faithful
to
the
new
religion
it
must
have
had
some
elements
of
vitality
almost
worth
fighting
for
and
which
we
do
not
comprehend
nor
did
saracenic
conquests
end
until
the
arabs
of
the
desert
had
penetrated
southward
into
india
farther
than
had
alexander
the
great
and
westward
until
they
had
subdued
the
northern
kingdoms
of
africa
and
carried
their
arms
to
the
pillars
of
hercules
yea
to
the
cities
of
the
goths
in
spain
and
were
only
finally
arrested
in
europe
by
the
heroism
of
charles
martel
such
were
the
rapid
conquests
of
the
saracens
and
permanent
conquests
also
in
asia
and
africa
under
the
stimulus
of
religious
fanaticism
until
they
had
reduced
thousand
cities
towns
and
castles
and
built
fourteen
thousand
mosques
now
what
are
the
deductions
to
be
logically
drawn
from
these
stupendous
victories
and
the
consolidation
of
the
various
religions
of
the
conquered
into
the
creed
of
mohammed
not
repudiated
when
the
pressure
was
removed
but
apparently
cherished
by
one
hundred
and
eighty
millions
of
people
for
more
than
a
thousand
years
we
must
take
the
ground
that
the
religion
of
mohammed
has
marvellous
and
powerful
truths
which
we
have
overlooked
and
do
not
understand
which
appeal
to
the
heart
and
conscience
and
excite
a
great
enthusiasm
so
great
as
to
stimulate
successive
generations
with
an
almost
unexampled
ardor
and
to
defend
which
they
were
ready
to
die
a
religion
which
has
bound
diverse
nations
together
for
nearly
fourteen
hundred
years
if
so
it
can
not
be
abused
or
ridiculed
or
sneered
at
any
more
than
can
the
dominion
of
the
popes
in
the
middle
ages
but
remains
august
in
impressive
mystery
to
us
and
even
to
future
ages
but
if
in
comparison
with
christianity
it
is
a
corrupt
and
false
religion
as
many
assume
then
what
deductions
must
we
draw
from
its
amazing
triumphs
for
the
fact
stares
us
in
the
face
that
it
is
rooted
deeply
in
a
large
part
of
the
eastern
world
or
at
least
has
prevailed
victorious
for
more
than
a
thousand
years
first
we
must
conclude
that
the
external
triumph
of
a
religion
especially
among
ignorant
or
wicked
people
is
not
so
much
owing
to
the
purity
and
loftiness
of
its
truths
as
to
its
harmony
with
prevailing
errors
and
corruptions
when
mohammed
preached
his
sublimest
doctrines
and
appealed
to
reason
and
conscience
he
converted
about
a
score
of
people
in
thirteen
years
when
he
invoked
demoralizing
passions
he
converted
all
arabia
in
eleven
years
and
does
not
this
startling
conclusion
seem
to
be
confirmed
by
the
whole
history
of
mankind
how
slow
the
progress
of
christianity
for
two
hundred
years
except
when
assisted
by
direct
supernatural
influences
how
rapid
its
triumphs
when
it

how
popular
and
prevalent
and
widespread
are
those
religions
which
we
are
accustomed
to
regard
as
most
corrupt
buddhism
and
brahmanism
have
had
more
adherents
than
even
mohammedanism
how
difficult
it
was
for
moses
and
the
prophets
to
keep
the
jews
from
idolatry
what
caused
the
rapid
eclipse
of
faith
in
the
antediluvian
world
why
could
not
noah
establish
and
perpetuate
his
doctrines
among
his
own
descendants
before
he
was
dead
why
was
the
socratic
philosophy
unpopular
why
were
the
epicureans
so
fashionable
why
was
christianity
itself
most
eagerly
embraced
when
its
light
was
obscured
by
fables
and
superstitions
why
did
the
roman
empire
perish
with
all
the
aid
of
a
magnificent
civilization
why
did
this
civilization
itself
retrograde
why
did
its

and
literature
decline
why
did
the
grand
triumphs
of
protestantism
stop
in
half
a
century
after
luther
delivered
his
message
what
made
the
mediaeval
popes
so
powerful
what
gave
such
ascendency
to
the
jesuits
why
is
the
simple
faith
of
the
primitive
christians
so
obnoxious
to
the
wise
the
mighty
and
the
noble
what
makes
the
most
insidious
heresies
so
acceptable
to
the
learned
why
is
modern
literature
when
fashionable
and
popular
so
antichristian
in
its
tone
and
spirit
why
have
not
the
doctrines
of
luther
held
their
own
in
germany
and
those
of
calvin
in
geneva
and
those
of
cranmer
in

and
those
of
the
pilgrim
fathers
in

is
it
because
as
men
become
advanced
in
learning
and
culture
they
are
theologically
wiser
than
moses
and
abraham
and
isaiah
i
do

in

in

i
do
not

over

i
would
not

jeremiads
over
the

developments
of
mankind
i
simply
speak
of
the
marvellous
similarity
which
the
spread
and
triumph
of
mohammedanism
seem
to
bear
to
the
spread
and
triumph
of
what
is
corrupt
and
wicked
in
all
institutions
and
religions
since
the
fall
of
man
everywhere
it
is
the
frivolous
the
corrupt
the
false
which
seem
to
be
most
prevalent
and
most
popular
do
men
love
truth
or
readily
accept
it
when
it
conflicts
with
passions
and
interests
is
any
truth
popular
which
is
arrayed
against
the
pride
of
reason
when
has
pure
moral
truth
ever
been
fashionable
when
have
its
advocates
not
been
reviled
slandered
misrepresented
and
persecuted
if
it
has
interfered
with
the
domination
of
prevailing
interests
the
lower
the
scale
of
pleasures
the
more
eagerly
are
they
sought
by
the
great
mass
of
the
people
even
in
christian
communities
you
can
best
make
colleges
thrive
by
turning
them
into
schools
of
technology
with
a
view
of
advancing
utilitarian
and
material
interests
you
can
not
make
a
newspaper
flourish
unless
you
fill
it
with
pictures
and
scandals
or
make
it
a
vehicle
of
advertisements
which
are
not
frivolous
or
corrupt
it
is
true
but
which
have
to
do
with
merely
material
interests
your
libraries
would
never
be
visited
if
you
took
away
their
trash
your
books
would
not
be
read
unless
you
made
them
an
insult
to
the
human
understanding
your
salons
would
be
deserted
if
you
entertained
your
guests
with
instructive
conversation
there
would
be
no
fashionable
gatherings
if
it
were
not
to
display
dresses
and
diamonds
your
pulpits
would
be
unoccupied
if
you
sought
the
profoundest
men
to
fill
them
everything
even
in
christian
communities
shows
that
vanities
and
follies
and
falsehoods
are
the
most
sought
and
that
nothing
is
more
discouraging
than
appeals
to
high
intelligence
or
virtue
even
in
art
this
is
the
uniform
history
of
the
race
everywhere
and
in
all
ages
is
it
darkness
or
light
which
the
world
loves
i
never
read
and
i
never
heard
of
a
great
man
with
a
great
message
to
deliver
who
would
not
have
sunk
under
disappointment
or
chagrin
but
for
his
faith
everywhere
do
you
see
the
fascination
of
error
so
that
it
almost
seems
to
be
as
vital
as
truth
itself
when
and
where
have
not
lies
and
sophistries
and
hypocrisies
reigned
i
appeal
to
history
i
appeal
to
the
observation
and
experience
of
every
thoughtful
and
candid
mind
you
can
not
get
around
this
truth
it
blazes
and
it
burns
like
the
fires
of
sinai
men
left
to
themselves
will
more
and
more
retrograde
in
virtue
what
then
is
the
hope
of
the
world
we
are
driven
to
this
deduction
that
if
truth
in
itself
is
not
the
divine
assistance
given
at
times
to
truth
itself
as
in
the
early
church
is
the
only
reason
why
truth
conquers
this
divine
grace
promised
in
the
bible
has
wrought
wonders
whenever
it
has
pleased
the
almighty
to
bestow
it
and
only
then
history
teaches
this
as
impressively
as
revelation
christianity
itself
unaided
would
probably
die
out
in
this
world
and
hence
the
grand
conclusion
is
that
it
is
the
mysterious
or
as
some
call
it
the
supernatural
spirit
of
almighty
power
which
is
after
all
the
highest
hope
of
this
world
this
is
not
discrepant
with
the
oldest
traditions
and
theogonies
of
the
east
the
hidden
wisdom
of
ancient
indian
and
persian
and
egyptian
sages
concealed
from
the
vulgar
but
really
embraced
by
the
profoundest
men
before
corruptions
perverted
even
their
wisdom
this
certainly
is
the
earliest
revelation
of
the
bible
this
is
the
power
which
moses
recognized
and
all
the
prophets
who
succeeded
him
this
is
the
power
which
even
mohammed
in
the
loftiness
of
his
contemplations
more
dimly
saw
and
imperfectly
taught
to
the
idolaters
around
him
and
which
gives
to
his
system
all
that
was
really
valuable
ask
not
when
and
where
this
power
shall
be
most
truly
felt
it
is
around
us
and
above
us
and
beneath
us
it
is
the
mystery
and
grandeur
of
the
ages
it
is
not
by
might
nor
by
power
but
by
my
spirit
saith
the
lord
man
is
nothing
his
aspirations
are
nothing
the
universe
itself
is
nothing
without
the
living
permeating
force
which
comes
from
this
supernal
deity
we
adore
to
interfere
and
save
without
his
special
agency
giving
to
his
truths
vitality
this
world
would
soon
become
a
hopeless
and
perpetual
pandemonium
take
away
the
necessity
of
this
divine
assistance
as
the
one
great
condition
of
all
progress
as
well
as
the
highest
boon
which
mortals
seek
then
prayer
itself
recognized
even
by
mohammedans
as
the
loftiest
aspiration
and
expression
of
a
dependent
soul
and
regarded
by
prophets
and
apostles
and
martyrs
as
their
noblest
privilege
becomes
a
superstition
a
puerility
a
mockery
and
a
hopeless
dream

charlemagne
revival
of
western
empire
the
most
illustrious
monarch
of
the
middle
ages
was
doubtless
charlemagne
certainly
he
was
the
first
great
statesman
hero
and
organizer
that
looms
up
to
view
after
the
dissolution
of
the
roman
empire
therefore
i
present
him
as
one
with
whom
is
associated
an
epoch
in
civilization
to
him
we
date
the
first
memorable
step
which
europe
took
out
of
the
anarchies
of
the
merovingian
age
his
dream
was
to
revive
the
empire
that
had
fallen
he
was
the
first
to
labor
with
giant
strength
to
restore
what
vice
and
violence
had
destroyed
he
did
not
succeed
in
realizing
the
great
ends
to
which
he
aspired
but
his
aspirations
were
lofty
it
was
not
in
the
power
of
any
man
to
civilize
in
a
single
reign
but
if
he
attempted
impossibilities
he
did
not
live
in
vain
since
he
bequeathed
some
permanent
conquests
and
some
great
traditions
he
left
a
great
legacy
to
civilization
his
life
has
not
dramatic
interest
like
that
of
hildebrand
nor
poetic
interest
like
the
lives
of
the
leaders
of
the
crusades
but
it
is
very
instructive
he
was
the
pride
of
his
own
generation
and
the
boast
of
succeeding
ages
claimed
says
sismondi
by
the
church
as
a
saint
by
the
french
as
the
greatest
of
their
kings
by
the
germans
as
their
countryman
and
by
the
italians
as
their
emperor
his
remote
ancestors
it
is
said
were
ecclesiastical
magnates
his
grandfather
was
charles
martel
who
gained
such
signal
victories
over
the
mohammedan
saracens
his
father
was
pepin
who
was
a
renowned
conqueror
and
who
subdued
the
southern
part
of
france
or
gaul
he
did
not
rise
like
clovis
from
the
condition
of
a
chieftain
of
a
tribe
of
barbarians
nor
like
the
founder
of
his
family
from
a
mayor
of
the
palace
or
minister
of
the
merovingian
kings
his
early
life
was
spent
amid
the
turmoils
and
dangers
of
camps
and
as
a
young
man
he
was
distinguished
for
precocity
of
talent
manly
beauty
and
gigantic
physical
strength
he
was
a
type
of
chivalry
before
chivalry
arose
he
was
born
to
greatness
and
early
succeeded
to
a
great
inheritance
at
the
age
of
in
the
year
he
became
the
monarch
of
the
greater
part
of
modern
france
and
of
those
provinces
which
border
on
the
rhine
by
unwearied
activities
this
inheritance
greater
than
that
of
any
of
the
merovingian
kings
was
not
only
kept
together
and
preserved
but
was
increased
by
successive
conquests
until
no
so
great
an
empire
has
ever
been
ruled
by
any
one
man
in
europe
since
the
fall
of
the
roman
empire
from
his
day
to
ours
yet
greater
than
the
conquests
of
charlemagne
was
the
greatness
of
his
character
he
preserved
simplicity
and
gentleness
amid
all
the
distractions
attending
his
government
his
reign
affords
a
striking
contrast
to
that
of
all
his
predecessors
of
the
merovingian
dynasty
which
reigned
from
the
immediate
destruction
of
the
roman
empire
the
merovingian
princes
with
the
exception
of
clovis
and
a
few
others
were
mere
barbarians
although
converted
to
a
nominal
christianity
some
of
them
were
monsters
and
others
were
idiots

and
fourteen
years
only
two
of
whom
attained
to
man
estate
and
not
one
to
the
full
development
of
intellectual
powers
there
was
scarcely
one
who
did
not
live
in
a
state
of
perpetual
intoxication
or
who
did
not
rival
sardanapalus
in
effeminacy
and
commodus
in
cruelty
as
these
sovereigns
were
ruled
by
priests
their
iniquities
were
glossed
over
by
gregory
of
tours
in
annals
they
may
pass
for
saints
but
history
consigns
them
to
an
infamous
immortality
it
is
difficult
to
conceive
a
more
dreary
and
dismal
state
of
society
than
existed
in
france
and
in
fact
over
all
europe
when
charlemagne
began
to
reign
the
roman
empire
was
in
ruins
except
in
the
east
where
the
greek
emperors
reigned
at
constantinople
the
western
provinces
were
ruled
by
independent
barbaric
kings
there
was
no
central
authority
although
there
was
an
attempt
of
the
popes
to
revive
it
a
spiritual
rather
than
a
temporal
power
a
theocracy
whose
foundation
had
been
laid
by
leo
the
great
when
he
established
the
principle
that
he
was
the
successor
of
peter
to
whom
were
given
the
keys
of
heaven
and
hell
if
there
was
an
interesting
feature
in
the
times
it
was
this
spiritual
authority
exercised
by
the
bishops
of
rome
the
most
useful
and
beneficent
considering
the
evils
which
prevailed
the
reign
of
brute
force
the
barbaric
chieftains
yielded
a
partial
homage
to
this
spiritual
power
and
it
was
some
check
on
their
rapacity
of
violence
it
is
mournful
to
think
that
so
little
of
the
ancient
civilization
remained
in
the
eighth
century
its
eclipse
was
total
the
shadows
of
a
dark
and
long
night
of
superstition
and
ignorance
spread
over
europe
law
was
silenced
by
the
sword
justinian
glorious
legacy
was
already
forgotten
the
old
mechanism
which
had
kept
society
together
in
the
fifth
century
was
worn
out
broken
rejected
there
was
no
literature
no
philosophy
no
poetry
no
history
and
no
art
even
the
clergy
had
become
ignorant
superstitious
and
idle
forms
had
taken
the
place
of
faith
no
great
theologians
had
arisen
since
saint
augustine
the
piety
of
the
age
hid
itself
in
monasteries
and
these
monasteries
were
as
funereal
as
society
itself
men
despaired
of
the
world
and
retreated
from
it
to
sing
mournful
songs
the
architecture
of
the
age
expressed
the
sentiments
of
the
age
and
was
heavy
gloomy
and
monotonous
the
barbarians
ruthlessly
marched
over
the
ruins
of
cities
and
palaces
having
no
regard
for
the
treasures
of
the
classic
world
and
unmoved
by
the
lessons
of
its
past
experience
rome
itself
repeatedly
sacked
was
a
heap
of
ruins
no
reconstruction
had
taken
place
gardens
and
villas
were
as
desolate
as
the
ruined
palaces
which
were
the
abodes
of
owls
and
spiders
the
immortal
creations
of
the
chisel
were
used
to
prop
up
old
crumbling
walls
the
costly
monuments
of
senatorial
pride
were
broken
to
pieces
in
sport
or
in
caprice
and
those
structures
which
had
excited
the
admiration
of
ages
were
pulled
down
that
their
material
might
be
used
in
erecting
tasteless
edifices
literature
shared
the
general
desolation
the
valued
manuscripts
of
classical
ages
were
mutilated
erased
or
burned
the
monks
finished
the
destruction
which
the
barbarians
began
ignorance
as
well
as
anarchy
veiled
europe
in
darkness
the
rust
of
barbarism
became
harder
and
thicker
the
last
hope
of
man
had
fled
and
glory
was
succeeded
by
shame
even
slavery
the
curse
of
the
roman
empire
was
continued
by
the
barbarians
only
brute
force
was
not
made
subservient
to
intellect
but
intellect
to
brute
force
the
descendants
of
ancient
patrician
families
were
in
bondage
to
barbarians
the
age
was
the
jubilee
of
monsters
assassination
was
common
and
was
unavenged
by
law
every
man
was
his
own
avenger
of
crime
and
his
bloody
weapons
were
his
only
law
nor
were
there
seen
among
the
barbaric
chieftains
the
virtues
of
ancient
pagan
rome
and
greece
for
christianity
was
nominal
war
was
universal
for
the
barbarians
having
no
longer
the
romans
to
fight
fought
among
themselves
there
were
incessant
irruptions
of
different
tribes
passing
from
one
country
to
another
in
search
of
plunder
and
pillage
there
was
no
security
of
life
or
property
and
therefore
no
ambition
for
acquisition
men
hid
themselves
in
morasses
in
forests
on
the
tops
of
inaccessible
hills
and
amid
the
recesses
of
valleys
for
violence
was
the
rule
and
not
the
exception
even
feudalism
was
not
then
born
and
still
less
chivalry
we
find
no
elevated
sentiments
the
only
refuge
for
the
miserable
was
in
the
church
and
the
church
was
governed
by
narrow
and
ignorant
priests
a
cry
of
despair
went
up
to
heaven
among
the
descendants
of
the
old
population
there
was
no
commerce
no
travel
no
industries
no
money
no
peace
the
chastisement
of
almighty
power
seems
to
have
been
sent
on
the
old
races
and
the
new
alike
it
was
a
desolation
greater
than
that
predicted
by
jeremy
the
prophet
the
very
end
of
the
world
seemed
to
be
at
hand
never
in
the
old
seats
of
civilization
was
there
such
a
disintegration
never
such
a
combination
of
evils
and
miseries
and
there
appeared
to
be
no
remedy
nothing
but
a
long
night
of
horrors
and
sufferings
could
be
predicted
gaul
or
france
was
the
scene
of
turbulence
invasions
and
anarchies
of
murders
of
conflagrations
and
of
pillage
by
rival
chieftains
who
sought
to
divide
its
territories
among
themselves
the
people
were
utterly
trodden
down
england
was
the
of
danes
saxons
and
celts
invaded
perpetually
and
split
up
into
petty
saxon
kingdoms
the
roads
were
infested
with
robbers
and
agriculture
was
rude
the
people
lived
in
cabins
dressed
themselves
in
skins
and
fed
on
the
coarsest
food
spain
was
invaded
by
saracens
and
the
gothic
kingdoms
succumbed
to
these
fierce
invaders
italy
was
portioned
out
among
different
tribes
gothic
and
slavonic
but
the
prevailing
races
in
europe
were
germanic
who
had
conquered
both
the
celts
and
the
romans
the

the
franks

what
a
commentary
on
the
imperial
government
of
the
caesars
that
government
which
with
all
its
mechanisms
and
traditions
lasted
scarcely
four
hundred
years
was
there
ever
in
the
whole
history
of
the
world
so
sudden
and
mournful
a
change
from
civilization
to
barbarism
and
this
in
spite
of
art
science
law
and
christianity
itself
were
there
no
conservative
forces
in
that
imposing
empire
why
did
society
constantly
decline
for
four
hundred
years
with
that
civilization
which
was
its
boast
and
hope
oh
ye
optimists
who
talk
so
glibly
about
the
natural
and
necessary
progress
of
humanity
why
was
the
roman
empire
swept
away
with
all
its
material
glories
to
give
place
to
such
a
state
of
society
as
i
have
just
briefly
described
and
yet
men
should
arise
in
due
time
after
the
punishment
of
five
centuries
of
crime
and
violence
wretchedness
and
despair
to
reconstruct
not
from
the
old
pagan
materials
of
greece
and
rome
but
with
the
fresh
energies
of
new
races
aided
and
inspired
by
the
truths
of
the
everlasting
gospel
the
infancy
of
the
new
races
sprung
however
from
the
same
old
aryan
stock
passed
into
vigorous
youth
when
charlemagne
appeared
from
him
we
date
the
first
decided
impulse
given
to
the
gothic
civilization
he
was
the
morning
star
of
european
hopes
and
aspirations
let
us
now
turn
to
his
glorious
deeds
what
were
the
services
he
rendered
to
europe
and
christian
civilization
it
was
necessary
that
a
truly
great
man
should
arise
in
the
eighth
century
if
the
new
forces
of
civilization
were
to
be
organized
to
show
what
he
did
for
the
new
races
and
how
he
did
it
is
the
duty
and
task
in
describing
the
reign
of
charlemagne
sent
i
think
as
moses
was
for
a
providential
mission
in
the
fulness
of
time
after
the
slaveries
of
three
hundred
years
which
prepared
the
people
for
labor
and
industry
better
was
it
that
they
should
till
the
lands
of
allodial
proprietors
in
misery
and
sorrow
attacked
and
pillaged
than
to
wander
like
savages
in
forests
and
morasses
in
quest
of
a
precarious
support
or
in
great
predatory
bands
as
they
did
in
the
fourth
and
fifth
centuries
when
they
ravaged
the
provinces
of
the
falling
empire
nothing
was
wanted
but
their
consolidation
under
central
rule
in
order
to
repel
aggressors
and
that
is
what
charlemagne
attempted
to
do
he
soon
perceived
the
greatness
of
the
struggle
to
which
he
was
destined
and
he
did
not
flinch
from
the
contest
which
has
given
him
immortality
he
comprehended
the
difficulties
which
surrounded
him
and
the
dangers
which
menaced
him
the
great
perils
which
threatened
europe
were
from
unsubdued
barbarians
who
sought
to
replunge
it
into
the
miseries
which
the
great
irruptions
had
inflicted
three
hundred
years
before
he
therefore
bent
all
the
energies
of
his
mind
and
all
the
resources
of
his
kingdom
to
arrest
these
fresh
waves
of
inundation
and
so
long
was
his
contest
with
saxons
avares
lombards
and
other
tribes
and
races
that
he
is
chiefly
to
be
contemplated
as
a
man
who
struggled
against
barbarism
and
he
fought
them
not
for
excitement
not
for
the
love
of
fighting
not
for
useless
conquests
not
for
military
fame
not
for
aggrandizement
but
because
a
stern
necessity
was
laid
upon
him
to
protect
his
own
territories
and
the
institutions
he
wished
to
conserve
of
these
barbarians
there
was
one
nation
peculiarly
warlike
and
ferocious
and
which
cherished
an
inextinguishable
hatred
not
merely
of
the
franks
but
of
civilization
itself
they
were
obstinately
attached
to
their
old
superstitions
and
had
a
great
repugnance
to
christianity
they
were
barbarians
like
the
old
north
american
indians
because
they
determined
to
be
so
because
they
loved
their
forests
and
the
chase
indulged
in
amusements
which
were
uncertain
and
dangerous
and
sought
for
nothing
beyond
their
immediate
inclinations
they
had
no
territorial
divisions
and
abhorred
cities
as
prisons
of
despotism
but
like
all
the
germanic
barbarians
they
had
interesting
traits
they
respected
women
they
were
brave
and
daring
they
had
a
dogged
perseverance
and
a
noble
passion
for
personal
independence
but
they
were
nevertheless
the
enemies
of
civilization
of
a
regular
and
industrious
life
and
sought
plunder
and
revenge
the
franks
and
goths
were
once
like
them
before
the
time
of
clovis
but
they
had
made
settlements
they
tilled
the
land
and
built
villages
and
cities
they
were
partially
civilized
and
were
converted
to
christianity
but
these
new
barbarians
could
not
be
won
by
arts
or
the
ministers
of
religion
these
people
were
the
saxons
and
inhabited
those
parts
of
germany
which
were
bounded
by
the
rhine
the
oder
the
north
sea
and
the
thuringian
forests
they
were
fond
of
the
sea
and
of
daring
expeditions
for
plunder
they
were
a
kindred
race
to
those
saxons
who
had
conquered
england
and
had
the
same
elements
of
character
they
were
poor
and
sought
to
live
by
piracy
and
robbery
they
were
very
dangerous
enemies
but
if
brought
under
subjection
to
law
and
converted
to
christianity
might
be
turned
into
useful
allies
for
they
had
the
materials
of
a
noble
race
with
such
a
people
on
his
borders
and
every
day
becoming
more
formidable
what
was
charlemagne
policy
what
was
he
to
do
the
only
thing
to
the
eye
of
that
enlightened
statesman
was
to
conquer
them
if
possible
and
add
their
territories
to
the
frankish
empire
if
left
to
themselves
they
might
have
conquered
the
franks
it
was
either
anvil
or
hammer
there
could
be
no
lasting
peace
in
europe
while
these
barbarians
were
left
to
pursue
their
depredations
a
vigorous
warfare
was
imperative
for
unless
subdued
a
disadvantageous
war
would
be
carried
on
near
the
frontiers
until
some
warrior
would
arise
among
them
unite
the
various
chieftains
and
lead
his
followers
to
successful
invasion
charlemagne
knew
that
the
difficult
and
unpleasant
work
of
subjugation
must
be
done
by
somebody
and
he
was
unwilling
to
leave
the
work
to
enervated
successors
the
work
was
not
child
play
it
took
him
the
best
part
of
his
life
to
accomplish
it
and
amid
great
discouragements
of
his
expeditions
eighteen
were
against
the
saxons
as
soon
as
he
had
cut
off
one
head
of
the
monster
another
head
appeared
how
allegorical
of
human
labor
is
that
old
fable
of
the
hydra
where
do
man
labors
cease
charlemagne
fought
not
only
amid
great
difficulties
but
perpetual
irritations
the
saxons
cheated
him
they
broke
their
promises
and
their
oaths
when
beaten
they
sued
for
peace
but
the
moment
his
back
was
turned
they
broke
out
in
new
insurrections
the
fame
of
caesar
chiefly
rests
on
his
eight
campaigns
in
gaul
but
caesar
had
the
disciplined
legions
of
rome
to
fight
with
charlemagne
had
no
such
disciplined
troops
yet
he
had
as
many
difficulties
to
surmount
as
caesar
rugged
forests
to
penetrate
rapid
rivers
to
cross
morasses
to
avoid
and
mountains
to
climb
it
is
a
very
difficult
thing
to
subdue
even
savages
who
are
desperate
determined
and
united
charlemagne
fought
the
saxons
for
years
though
he
never
lost
a
battle
they
still
held
out
at
first
he
was
generous
and
forgiving
for
he
was
more
magnanimous
than
caesar
but
they
could
not
be
won
by
kindness
he
was
obliged
to
change
his
course
and
at
last
was
as
summary
as
oliver
cromwell
in
ireland
he
is
even
accused
of
cruelties
but
war
in
the
hands
of
masters
has
no
quarter
to
give
and
no
tears
to
shed
it
was
necessary
to
conquer
the
saxons
and
charlemagne
used
the
requisite
means
sometimes
the
harshest
measures
will
most
speedily
effect
the
end
did
our
fathers
ever
dream
of
compromise
with
treacherous
and
hostile
indians
war
has
a
horrid
maxim
that
nothing
is
so
successful
as
success
charlemagne
at
last
was
successful
the
saxons
were
so
completely
subdued
at
the
end
of
years
that
they
never
molested
civilized
europe
again
they
became
civilized
like
the
once
invading
celts
and
goths
and
they
even
embraced
the
religion
of
the
conquerors
they
became
ultimately
the
best
people
in
europe
earnest
honest
and
brave
they
formed
great
kingdoms
and
states
and
became
new
barriers
against
fresh
inundations
from
the
north
and
east
the
saxons
formed
the
nucleus
of
the
great
german
empire
or
were
incorporated
with
it
which
arose
in
the
middle
ages
and
which
is
the
most
powerful
in
europe
and
the
least
corrupted
by
the
vices
of
a
luxurious
life
the
descendants
of
those
saxons
are
among
the
most
industrious
and
useful
settlers
in
the
new
world
there
was
one
mistake
which
charlemagne
made
in
reference
to
them
he
forced
their
conversion
to
a
nominal
christianity
he
immersed
them
in
the
rivers
of
saxony
whether
they
would
or
no
he
would
make
them
christians
in
his
way
but
then
who
does
not
seek
to
make
converts
in
his
way
whether
enlightened
or
not
when
have
the
principles
of
religious
toleration
been
understood
did
the
puritans
understand
them
with
all
their
professions
do
we
tolerate
in
our
hearts
those
who
differ
from
us
do
not
men
look
daggers
though
they
dare
not
use
them
if
we
had
the
power
would
we
not
seek
to
produce
conformity
with
our
notions
like
queen
elizabeth
or
oliver
cromwell
or
archbishop
laud
there
is
not
perhaps
a
village
in
america
where
a
true
catholicism
reigns
there
is
not
a
spot
upon
the
globe
where
there
is
not
some
form
of
religious
persecution
nor
is
there
anything
more
sincere
than
religious
bigotry
and
when
people
have
not
fundamental
principles
to
fight
about
they
will
fight
about
technicalities
and
matters
of
no
account
and
all
the
more
bitterly
sometimes
when
the
objects
of
contention
are
not
worth
fighting
about
at
all
as
in
forms
of
worship
or
baptism
such
is
the
weakness
of
human
nature
charlemagne
was
no
exception
to
the
race
but
if
he
wished
to
make
christians
in
his
way
he
was
on
the
whole
enlightened
he
caused
the
young
saxons
whom
he
baptized
and
marked
with
the
sign
of
the
cross
to
be
educated
he
built
monasteries
and
churches
in
the
conquered
territories
he
recognized
this
that
christianity
whatever
it
be
is
the
mightiest
power
of
the
world
and
he
bore
his
testimony
in
behalf
of
the
intellectual
dignity
of
the
clergy
in
comparison
with
other
classes
he
encouraged
missions
as
well
as
schools
there
was
another
germanic
tribe
at
that
time
which
he
held
in
great
alarm
but
which
he
did
not
attack
since
they
were
not
immediately
dangerous
this
tribe
or
race
was
the
norman
just
then
beginning
their
ravages
pirates
in
open
boats
they
had
dared
to
enter
a
port
in
narbonensis
gaul
for
purposes
of
plunder
some
took
them
for
africans
and
others
for
british
merchants
nay
said
charlemagne
they
are
not
merchants
but
cruel
enemies
and
he
covered
his
face
with
his
iron
hands
and
wept
like
a
child
he
did
not
fear
these
barbarians
but
he
wept
when
he
foresaw
the
evil
they
would
do
when
he
was
dead
i
weep
said
he
that
they
should
dare
almost
to
land
on
my
shores
in
my
lifetime
these
normans
escaped
him
they
conquered
and
they
founded
kingdoms
but
they
did
not
replunge
europe
in
darkness
a
barrier
had
been
made
against
their
inundation
the
saxon
conquest
was
that
barrier
moreover
the
normans
were
the
noblest
race
of
barbarians
which
then
roamed
through
the
forests
of
germany
or
skirted
the
shores
of
scandinavia
they
had
grand
natural
traits
of
character
they
were
poetic
brave
and
adventurous
they
were
superior
to
the
saxons
and
the
franks
when
converted
they
were
the
great
allies
of
the
pope
and
early
became
civilized
to
them
we
trace
the
noblest
development
of
gothic
architecture
they
became
great
scholars
and
statesmen
they
were
more
refined
by
nature
than
the
saxons
and
avoided
their
gluttonous
habits
in
after
times
they
composed
the
flower
of
european
chivalry
it
was
providential
that
they
were
not
subdued
that
they
became
the
leading
race
in
northern
europe
to
them
we
trace
the
mercantile
greatness
of
england
for
they
were
born
sailors
they
never
lost
their
natural
heroism
or
love
of
power
the
next
important
conquest
of
charlemagne
was
that
of
the
avares
a
tribe
of
the
huns
of
slavonic
origin
they
are
represented
as
very
hideous
barbarians
and
only
thought
of
plunder
they
never
sought
to
reconstruct
there
seemed
to
be
no
end
of
their
invasions
from
the
time
of
attila
they
were
more
formidable
for
their
numbers
and
destructive
ravages
than
for
their
military
skill
there
was
a
time
however
when
they
threatened
the
combined
forces
of
germany
and
rome
but
europe
was
delivered
by
the
battle
of
poictiers
the
bloodiest
battle
on
record
when
they
seemed
to
be
annihilated
but
they
sprang
up
again
in
new
invasions
in
the
ninth
century
had
they
conquered
civilization
would
have
been
crushed
out
but
charlemagne
was
successful
against
them
and
from
that
time
to
this
they
were
shut
out
from
western
europe
they
would
be
formidable
now
for
the
russians
are
the
descendants
of
these
people
were
it
not
for
the
barrier
raised
against
them
by
the
germans
the
necessities
of
europe
still
require
the
vast
military
strength
and
organization
of
germany
not
to
fight
france
but
to
awe
russia
napoleon
predicted
that
europe
would
become
either
french
or
cossack
but
there
is
little
probability
of
russian
aggressions
in
europe
so
long
as
russia
is
held
in
check
by
germany
charlemagne
had
now
delivered
france
and
germany
from
external
enemies
he
then
turned
his
arms
against
the
saracens
of
spain
this
was
the
great
mistake
of
his
life
yet
every
one
makes
mistakes
however
great
his
genius
alexander
made
the
mistake
of
pushing
his
arms
into
india
and
napoleon
made
a
great
blunder
in
invading
russia
even
caesar
died
at
the
right
time
for
his
military
fame
for
he
was
on
the
point
of
attempting
the
conquest
of
parthia
where
like
crassus
he
would
probably
have
perished
or
have
lost
his
army
needless
conquests
seem
to
be
impossible
in
the
moral
government
of
god
who
rules
the
fate
of
war
conquests
are
only
possible
when
civilization
seems
to
require
them
in
seeking
to
invade
spain
charlemagne
warred
against
a
race
from
whom
europe
had
nothing
more
to
fear
his
grandfather
charles
martel
had
arrested
the
conquests
of
the
saracens
and
they
were
quiet
in
their
settlements
in
spain
and
had
made
considerable
attainments
in
science
and
literature
their
schools
of
medicine
and
their
arts
were
in
advance
of
the
rest
of
europe
they
were
the
translators
of
aristotle
who
reigned
in
the
rising
universities
during
the
middle
ages
as
this
war
was
unnecessary
providence
seemed
to
rebuke
charlemagne
his
defeat
at
roncesvalles
was
one
of
the
most
memorable
events
in
his
military
history
prodigies
of
valor
were
wrought
by
him
and
his
gallant
paladins
the
early
heroic
poetry
of
the
middle
ages
has
commemorated
his
exploits
as
well
as
those
of
his
nephew
roland
to
whom
some
writers
have
ascribed
the
origin
of
chivalry
but
the
frankish
forces
were
signally
defeated
amid
the
passes
of
the
pyrenees
and
it
was
not
until
after
several
centuries
that
the
gothic
princes
of
spain
shook
off
the
yoke
of
their
saracenic
conquerors
and
drove
them
from
europe
the
lombard
wars
of
charlemagne
are
the
last
to
which
i
allude
these
were
undertaken
in
defence
of
the
church
to
rescue
his
ally
the
pope
the
lombards
belonged
to
the
great
germanic
family
but
they
were
unfriendly
to
the
pope
and
to
the
church
they
stood
out
against
the
empire
which
was
then
the
chief
hope
of
europe
and
of
civilization
they
would
have
reduced
the
pope
to
insignificance
and
seized
his
territories
without
uniting
italy
so
charlemagne
like
his
father
pepin
lent
his
powerful
aid
to
the
roman
bishop
and
the
lombards
were
easily
subdued
this
conquest
although
the
easiest
which
he
ever
made
most
flattered
his
pride
lombardy
was
not
only
joined
to
his
empire
but
he
received
unparalleled
honors
from
the
pope
being
crowned
by
him
emperor
of
the
west
it
was
a
proud
day
when
in
the
ancient
metropolis
of
the
world
and
in
the
fulness
of
his
fame
pope
leo
iii
placed
the
crown
of
augustus
upon
charlemagne
brow
and
gave
to
him
amid
the
festivities
of
christmas
his
apostolic
benediction
his
dominions
now
extended
from
catalonia
to
the
bohemian
forests
embracing
germany
france
the
netherlands
italy
and
the
spanish
main
the
largest
empire
which
any
one
man
has
possessed
since
the
fall
of
the
roman
empire
what
more
natural
than
for
charlemagne
to
feel
that
he
had
restored
the
western
empire
what
more
natural
than
that
he
should
have
taken
the
title
still
claimed
by
the
austrian
emperor
in
one
sense
his
legitimate
successor
kaiser
or
caesar
in
the
possession
of
such
enormous
power
he
naturally
dreamed
of
establishing
a
new
universal
military
monarchy
like
that
of
the
romans
as
charles
dreamed
and
napoleon
after
him
but
this
is
a
dream
that
providence
has
rebuked
among
all
successive
conquerors
there
may
have
been
need
of
the
universal
monarchy
of
the
caesars
that
christianity
might
spread
in
peace
and
be
protected
by
a
reign
of
law
and
order
this
at
least
is
one
of
the
platitudes
of
historians
froude
himself
harps
on
it
in
his
life
of
caesar
historians
are
fond
of
exalting
the
glories
of
imperialism
and
everybody
is
dazzled
by
the
splendor
and
power
of
ancient
roman
emperors
they
do
not
i
think
sufficiently
consider
the
blasting
influence
of
imperialism
on
the
life
of
nations
how
it
dries
up
the
sources
of
renovation
how
it
necessarily
withers
literature
and
philosophy
how
nothing
can
thrive
under
it
but
pomp
and
material
glories
how
it
paralyzes
all
virtuous
impulses
how
it
kills
all
enthusiasm
how
it
crushes
out
all
hope
and
lofty
aspirations
how
it
makes
slaves
of
its
best
subjects
how
it
fills
the
earth
with
fear
how
it
drains
national
resources
to
support
standing
armies
how
it
mocks
all
enterprises
which
do
not
receive
imperial
approbation
how
everything
is
concentrated
to
reflect
the
glory
of
one
man
or
family
how
impossible
under
its
withering
shade
is
manly
independence
or
the
free
expression
of
opinions
or
healthy
growth
how
it
buries
up
under
its
armies
discontents
and
aspirations
alike
and
creates
nothing
but
machinery
which
must
ultimately
wear
out
and
leave
a
world
in
ruins
with
nothing
stable
to
take
its
place
law
and
order
are
good
things
the
preservation
of
property
is
desirable
the
punishment
of
crime
is
necessary
but
there
are
other
things
which
are
valuable
also
nothing
is
so
valuable
as
the
preservation
of
national
life
nothing
is
so
healthy
as
scope
for
energies
nothing
is
so
contemptible
and
degrading
as
universal
sycophancy
to
official
rule
there
are
no
tyrants
more
oppressive
than
the
tools
of
absolute
power
see
in
what
a
state
imperialism
left
the
roman
empire
when
it
fell
there
were
no
rallying
forces
there
was
no
resurrection
of
heroes
vitality
had
fled
where
would
turkey
be
without
the
european
powers
if
the
sultan
authority
were
to
fall
it
would
be
in
the
state
of
ancient
babylon
or
persia
when
those
empires
fell
there
is
another
side
to
imperialism
besides
dreaded
anarchies
moreover
the
whole
progress
of
civilization
has
been
counter
to
it
the
fiats
of
eternal
justice
have
pronounced
against
it
because
it
is
antagonistic
to
the
dignity
of
man
and
the
triumphs
of
reason
i
would
not
fall
in
with
the
cant
of
the
dignity
of
man
because
there
is
no
dignity
to
man
without
aid
from
god
almighty
through
his
spirit
and
the
message
he
has
sent
in
christianity
but
there
is
dignity
in
man
with
the
aid
of
a
regenerating
gospel
some
people
talk
of
the
triumphs
of
christianity
under
the
roman
emperors
but
see
how
rapidly
it
was
corrupted
by
them
when
they
sought
the
aid
of
its
institutions
to
bolster
up
their
power
the
power
of
christianity
is
in
its
truths
in
its
religion
and
not
in
its
forms
and
institutions
in
its
inventions
to
uphold
the
arms
of
despotism
and
the
tools
of
despotism
it
is
and
it
was
and
it
will
be
through
all
the
ages
the
great
power
of
the
world
against
which
it
is
vain
to
rebel
and
that
government
is
really
the
best
which
unfetters
its
spiritual
influence
and
encourages
it
and
not
that
government
which
seeks
to
perpetuate
its
corrupt
and
worldly
institutions
the
roman
emperors
made
christianity
an
institution
and
obscured
its
truths
and
perhaps
that
is
one
reason
why
providence
permitted
their
despotism
to
pass
away
preferring
the
rude
anarchy
of
the
germanic
nations
to
the
dead
mechanism
of
a
lifeless
church
and
imperial
rottenness
imperialism
must
ever
end
in
rottenness
and
that
is
one
reason
why
the
heart
of
christendom
i
mean
the
people
of
europe
in
its
enlightened
and
virtuous
sections
has
ever
opposed
imperialism
the
progress
has
been
slow
but
marked
towards
representative
governments
not
the
reign
of
the
people
directly
but
of
those
whom
they
select
to
represent
them
the
victory
has
been
nearly
gained
in
england
in
france
the
progress
has
been
uniform
since
the
revolution
napoleon
revived
or
sought
to
revive
the
imperialism
of
rome
he
failed
there
is
nothing
which
the
french
now
so
cordially
detest
since
their
eyes
have
been
opened
to
the
character
and
ends
of
that
usurper
as
his
imperialism
it
can
not
be
revived
any
more
easily
than
the
oracles
of
dodona
even
in
germany
there
are
dreadful
discontents
in
view
of
the
imperialism
which
bismarck
by
the
force
of
successful
wars
has
seemingly
revived
the
awful
standing
armies
are
a
menace
to
all
liberty
and
progress
and
national
development
in
italy
itself
there
is
the
commencement
of
constitutional
authority
although
it
is
united
under
a
king
the
great
standing
warfare
of
modern
times
is
constitutional
authority
against
the
absolute
power
of
kings
and
emperors
and
the
progress
has
been
on
the
side
of
liberty
everywhere
with
occasional
drawbacks
such
as
when
louis
napoleon
revived
the
accursed
despotism
of
his
uncle
and
by
the
same
means
a
standing
army
and
promises
of
military
glory
hence
in
the
order
of
providence
the
dream
of
charlemagne
as
to
unbounded
military
aggrandizement
could
not
be
realized
he
could
not
revive
the
imperialism
of
rome
or
persia
no
man
will
ever
arise
in
europe
who
can
it
except
for
a
brief
period
it
will
be
rebuked
by
the
superintending
power
because
it
is
fatal
to
the
highest
development
of
nations
because
all
its
glories
are
delusory
because
it
sows
the
seeds
of
ruin
it
produces
that
very
egotism
materialism
and
sensuality
that
inglorious
rest
and
pleasure
which
as
everybody
concedes
prepared
the
way
for
violence
and
hence
charlemagne
empire
went
to
pieces
as
soon
as
he
was
dead
there
was
nothing
permanent
in
his
conquests
except
those
made
against
barbarism
he
was
raised
up
to
erect
barriers
against
fresh
inroads
of
barbarians
his
whole
empire
was
finally
split
up
into
petty
sovereignties
in
one
sense
he
founded
states
since
he
founded
the
states
which
sprang
up
from
the
dismemberment
of
his
empire
the
kingdoms
of
germany
italy
france
burgundy
lorraine
navarre
all
date
to
his
memorable
reign
but
these
mediaeval
kingdoms
were
feudal
the
power
of
the
kings
was
nominal
government
passed
from
imperialism
into
the
hands
of
nobles
the
government
of
europe
in
the
middle
ages
was
a
military
aristocracy
only
powerful
as
the
interests
of
the
people
were
considered
kings
and
princes
did
not
make
much
show
except
in
the
trappings
of
royalty
in
gorgeous
dresses
of
purple
and
gold
to
suit
a
barbaric
taste
in
the
insignia
of
power
without
its
reality
the
power
was
among
the
aristocracy
who
it
must
be
confessed
ground
down
the
people
by
a
hard
feudal
rule
but
who
did
not
grind
the
souls
out
of
them
like
the
imperialism
of
absolute
monarchies
with
their
standing
armies
under
them
the
feudal
nobles
of
europe
at
length
recuperated
virtues
were
born
everywhere
in
england
in
france
in
germany
in
holland
which
were
a
savor
of
life
unto
life
loyalty
fidelity
to
covenants
chivalry
sympathy
with
human
misery
love
of
home
rural
sports
a
glorious
rural
life
which
gave
stamina
to
character
a
material
which
christianity
could
work
upon
and
kindle
the
latent
fires
of
freedom
and
the
impulses
of
a
generous
enthusiasm
it
was
under
the
fostering
influences
of
small
independent
chieftains
that
manly
strength
and
organized
social
institutions
arose
once
more
the
reserved
power
of
unconquerable
nations
nobody
hates
feudalism
in
its
corruptions
in
its
oppressions
more
than
i
do
but
it
was
the
transition
stage
from
the
anarchy
which
the
collapse
of
imperialism
produced
to
the
constitutional
governments
of
our
times
if
we
could
forget
the
absolute
monarchies
which
flourished
on
the
breaking
up
of
feudalism
when
it
became
a
tyranny
and
a
mockery
but
which
absolute
monarchies
flourished
only
one
or
two
hundred
years
a
sort
of
necessity
in
the
development
of
nations
to
check
the
insolence
and
overgrown
power
of
nobles
but
after
all
essentially
different
from
the
imperialism
of
caesar
or
napoleon
since
they
relied
on
the
support
of
nobles
and
municipalities
more
than
on
a
standing
army
yea
on
votes
and
grants
from
parliaments
to
raise
money
to
support
the
army
certainly
in
england
as
in
the
time
of
elizabeth
the
bourbons
indeed
reigned
without
grants
from
the
people
or
the
nobility
and
what
was
the
logical
result
a
french
revolution
would
a
french
revolution
have
been
possible
under
the
roman
caesars
but
i
will
not
pursue
this
gradual
development
of
constitutional
government
from
the
anarchies
which
arose
out
of
the
fall
of
the
roman
empire
just
the
reverse
of
what
happened
in
the
history
of
rome
i
say
no
more
of
the
imperialism
which
charlemagne
sought
to
restore
but
was
not
permitted
by
providence
and
which
after
all
was
the
dream
of
his
latter
days
when
like
napoleon
he
was
intoxicated
by
power
and
brilliant
conquests
and
i
turn
to
consider
briefly
his
direct
effects
in
civilization
which
showed
his
great
and
enlightened
mind
and
on
which
his
fame
in
no
small
degree
rests
charlemagne
was
no
insignificant
legislator
his
capitularies
may
not
be
equal
to
the
laws
of
justinian
in
natural
justice
but
were
adapted
to
his
times
and
circumstances
he
collected
the
scattered
codes
so
far
as
laws
were
codified
of
the
various
germanic
nations
and
modified
them
he
introduced
a
great
christian
element
into
his
jurisprudence
he
made
use
of
the
canons
of
the
church
his
code
is
more
ecclesiastical
than
that
of
theodosius
even
the
last
great
christian
emperor
but
in
his
day
the
clergy
wielded
great
power
and
their
ordinances
and
decisions
were
directed
to
society
as
it
was
the
clergy
were
the
great
jurists
of
their
day
the
spiritual
courts
decided
matters
of
great
importance
and
took
cognizance
of
cases
which
were
out
of
the
jurisdiction
of
temporal
courts
charlemagne
recognized
the
value
of
these
spiritual
courts
and
aided
them
he
had
no
quarrels
with
ecclesiastics
nor
was
he
jealous
of
their
power
he
allied
himself
with
it
he
was
a
friend
of
the
clergy
one
of
the
peculiarities
of
all
the
germanic
laws
seen
especially
in
those
of
ina
and
alfred
was
pecuniary
compensation
for
crime
fifty
shillings
in
england
would
pay
for
the
loss
of
a
foot
and
twenty
for
a
nose
and
four
for
a
tooth
thus
recognizing
a
principle
seen
in
our
times
in
railroad
accidents
though
not
recognized
in
our
civil
laws
in
reference
to
crimes
this
system
of
compensation
charlemagne
retained
which
perhaps
answered
for
his
day
he
was
also
a
great
administrator
nothing
escaped
his
vigilance
i
do
not
read
that
he
made
many
roads
or
effected
important
internal
improvements
the
age
was
too
barbarous
for
the
development
of
national
industries
one
of
the
main
things
which
occupy
modern
statesmen
and
governments
but
whatever
he
did
was
wise
and
enlightened
he
rewarded
merit
he
made
an
alliance
with
learned
men
he
sought
out
the
right
men
for
important
posts
he
made
the
learned
alcuin
his
teacher
and
counsellor
he
established
libraries
and
schools
he
built
convents
and
monasteries
he
gave
encouragement
to
men
of
great
attainments
he
loved
to
surround
himself
with
learned
men
the
scholars
of
all
countries
sought
his
protection
and
patronage
and
found
him
a
friend
alcuin
became
one
of
the
richest
men
in
his
dominions
and
englebert
received
one
of
his
daughters
in
marriage
napoleon
professed
a
great
admiration
for
charlemagne
although
frederic
ii
was
his
model
sovereign
but
how
differently
napoleon
acted
in
this
respect
napoleon
was
jealous
of
literary
genius
he
hated
literary
men
he
rarely
invited
them
to
his
table
and
was
constrained
in
their
presence
he
drove
them
out
of
the
kingdom
even
he
wanted
nothing
but
homage
and
literary
genius
has
no
sympathy
with
brute
force
or
machinery
or
military
exploits
but
charlemagne
like
peter
the
great
delighted
in
the
society
of
all
who
could
teach
him
anything
he
was
a
tolerably
learned
man
himself
considering
his
life
of
activity
he
spoke
latin
as
fluently
as
his
native
german
and
it
is
said
that
he
understood
greek
he
liked
to
visit
schools
and
witness
the
performances
of
the
boys
and
provided
they
made
proficiency
in
their
studies
he
cared
little
for
their
noble
birth
he
was
no
respecter
of
persons
with
wrath
he
reproved
the
idle
he
promised
rewards
to
merit
and
industry
the
most
marked
feature
of
his
reign
outside
his
wars
was
his
sympathy
with
the
clergy
here
too
he
differed
from
napoleon
and
frederic
ii
hallam
considers
his
alliance
with
the
church
the
great
error
of
his
reign
but
i
believe
it
built
up
his
throne
in
his
time
the
clergy
were
the
most
influential
people
of
the
empire
and
the
most
enlightened
but
at
that
time
the
great
contest
of
the
middle
ages
between
spiritual
and
temporal
authority
had
not
begun
ambrose
indeed
had
rebuked
theodosius
and
set
in
defiance
the
empress
when
she
interfered
with
his
spiritual
functions
and
leo
had
laid
the
of
the
papacy
by
instituting
a
divine
right
to
his
decrees
but
a
hildebrand
and
a
becket
had
not
arisen
to
usurp
the
prerogatives
of
their
monarchs
least
of
all
did
popes
then
dream
of
subjecting
the
temporal
powers
and
raising
the
spiritual
over
them
so
as
to
lead
to
issues
with
kings
that
was
a
later
development
in
the
history
of
the
papacy
the
popes
of
the
eighth
and
ninth
centuries
sought
to
heal
disorder
to
punish
turbulent
chieftains
to
sustain
law
and
order
to
establish
a
tribunal
of
justice
to
which
the
discontented
might
appeal
they
sought
to
conserve
the
peace
of
the
world
they
sought
to
rule
the
church
rather
than
the
world
they
aimed
at
a
theocratic
ministry
to
be
the
ambassadors
of
god
almighty
to
allay
strife
and
division
the
clergy
were
the
friends
of
order
and
law
and
they
were
the
natural
guardians
of
learning
they
were
kind
masters
to
the
slaves
for
slavery
still
prevailed
that
was
an
evil
with
which
the
clergy
did
not
grapple
they
would
ameliorate
it
but
did
not
seek
to
remove
it
yet
they
shielded
the
unfortunate
and
the
persecuted
and
the
poor
they
gave
the
only
consolation
which
an
iron
age
afforded
the
church
was
gloomy
ascetic
austere
like
the
cathedrals
of
that
time
monks
buried
themselves
in
crypts
they
sang
mournful
songs
they
saw
nothing
but
poverty
and
misery
and
they
came
to
the
relief
in
a
funereal
way
but
they
were
not
cold
and
hard
and
cruel
like
baronial
lords
secular
lords
were
rapacious
and
ground
down
the
people
and
mocked
and
trampled
upon
them
but
the
clergy
were
hospitable
gentle
and
affectionate
they
sympathized
with
the
people
from
whom
they
chiefly
sprang
they
had
their
vices
but
those
vices
were
not
half
so
revolting
as
those
of
barons
and
knights
intellectually
the
clergy
were
at
all
times
the
superiors
of
these
secular
lords
they
loved
the
peaceful
virtues
which
were
generated
in
the
consecrated
convent
the
passions
of
nobles
urged
them
on
to
perpetual
pillage
injustice
and
cruelty
the
clergy
only
quarrelled
among
themselves
their
vices
were
those
of
envy
and
perhaps
of
gluttony
but
they
were
not
public
robbers
they
were
the
best
farmers
of
their
times
they
cultivated
lands
and
made
them
attractive
by
fruits
and
flowers
they
were
generally
industrious
every
convent
was
a
beehive
in
which
various
kinds
of
manufactures
were
produced
the
monks
aspired
even
to
be
artists
they
illuminated
manuscripts
as
well
as
copied
them
they
made
tapestries
and
beautiful
vestments
they
were
a
peaceful
and
useful
set
of
men
at
this
period
outside
their
spiritual
functions
they
built
grand
churches
they
had
fruitful
gardens
they
were
exceedingly
hospitable
every
monastery
was
an
inn
as
well
as
a
beehive
to
which
all
travellers
resorted
and
where
no
pay
was
exacted
it
was
a
retreat
for
the
unfortunate
which
no
one
dared
assail
and
it
was
vocal
with
songs
and
anthems
the
clergy
were
not
only
thus
general
benefactors
in
an
age
of
turbulence
and
crime
in
spite
of
all
their
narrowness
and
spiritual
pride
and
ghostly
arts
and
ambition
for
power
but
they
lent
a
helping
hand
to
the
peasantry
the
church
was
democratic
and
enabled
the
poor
to
rise
according
to
their
merits
while
nobles
combined
to
crush
them
or
keep
them
in
an
ignoble
sphere
in
the
church
the
son
of
a
murdered
peasant
could
rise
according
to
his
deserts
but
if
he
followed
a
warrior
to
the
no
virtues
no
talents
no
bravery
could
elevate
him
he
was
still
a
peasant
a
menial
if
he
entered
a
monastery
he
might
pass
from
office
to
office
until
as
a
mitred
abbot
he
would
become
the
master
of
ten
thousand
acres
the
counsellor
of
kings
the
equal
of
that
proud
baron
in
whose
service
his
father
spent
his
abject
life
the
great
hildebrand
was
the
son
of
a
carpenter
the
church
ever
recognized
what
feudality
did
not
the
claims
of
man
as
man
and
enabled
peasants
sons
if
they
had
abilities
and
virtues
to
rise
to
proud
positions
to
be
the
patrons
of
the
learned
the
companions
of
princes
the
ministers
of
kings
and
that
is
the
reason
why
charlemagne
befriended
the
church
and
elevated
it
because
its
influence
was
civilizing
he
sought
to
establish
among
the
clergy
a
counterbalancing
power
to
that
of
nobles
who
can
doubt
that
the
influence
of
the
church
was
better
than
that
of
nobles
in
the
middle
ages
if
it
ground
down
society
by
a
spiritual
yoke
that
yoke
was
necessary
for
the
rude
middle
ages
could
be
ruled
only
by
fear
what
fear
more
potent
than
the
destruction
of
the
soul
in
a
future
life
it
was
by
this
weapon
excommunication
that
europe
was
governed
we
may
abhor
it
but
it
was
the
great
idea
of
mediaeval
europe
which
no
one
could
resist
and
which
kept
society
from
dissolution
charlemagne
may
have
erred
in
thus
giving
power
and
consideration
to
the
clergy
in
view
of
the
subsequent
encroachments
of
the
popes
but
he
never
anticipated
the
future
quarrels
between
his
successors
and
the
popes
for
the
popes
were
not
then
formidable
as
the
antagonists
of
kings
i
believe
his
policy
was
the
best
for
europe
on
the
whole
the
infancy
of
the
gothic
races
was
long
dark
dreary
and
unfortunate
but
it
prepared
them
for
the
civilization
which
they
scorned
such
were
the
services
which
this
great
sovereign
rendered
to
his
times
and
to
europe
he
probably
saved
it
from
renewed
barbarism
he
was
the
great
legislator
of
the
middle
ages
and
the
greatest
friend
after
constantine
and
theodosius
of
which
the
church
can
boast
with
him
dawned
the
new
civilization
he
brought
back
souvenirs
of
rome
and
the
empire
not
for
himself
did
he
live
but
for
the
welfare
of
the
nations
he
governed
it
was
his
example
which
alfred
sought
to
imitate
though
a
warrior
he
saw
something
greater
than
the
warrior
excellence
it
is
said
he
was
eloquent
like
julius
caesar
he
loved
music
and
all
the
arts
in
his
palace
at
were
sung
the
songs
of
the
earliest
poets
of
germany
he
took
great
pains
to
introduce
the
gregorian
chant
he
was
simple
in
dress
and
only
on
rare
occasions
did
he
indulge
in
parade
he
was
temperate
in
eating
and
drinking
as
all
the
famous
warriors
have
been
he
absolutely
abhorred
drunkenness
the
great
vice
of
the
northern
nations
during
meals
he
listened
to
the
lays
of
minstrels
or
the
readings
of
his
secretaries
he
took
unwearied
pains
with
the
education
of
his
daughters
and
he
was
so
fond
of
them
that
they
even
accompanied
him
in
his
military
expeditions
he
was
not
one
of
those
men
that
gibbon
appreciated
but
his
fame
is
steadily
growing
after
a
lapse
of
a
thousand
years
his
whole
appearance
was
manly
cheerful
and
dignified
his
countenance
reflected
a
serenity
he
was
one
of
the
few
men
like
david
who
was
not
spoiled
by
war
and
flatteries
though
gentle
he
was
subject
to
fits
of
anger
like
theodosius
but
he
did
not
affect
anger
like
napoleon
for
theatrical
effect
his
greatness
and
his
simplicity
his
humanity
and
his
religious
faith
are
typical
of
the
germanic
race
he
died
after
a
reign
of
half
a
century
lamented
by
his
own
subjects
and
to
be
admired
by
succeeding
generations
hallam
though
not
eloquent
generally
has
pronounced
his
most
beautiful
eulogy
written
in
the
disgraces
and
miseries
of
succeeding
times
he
stands
alone
like
a
rock
in
the
ocean
like
a
beacon
on
a
waste
his
sceptre
was
the
bow
of
ulysses
not
to
be
bent
by
a
weaker
hand
in
the
dark
ages
of
european
history
his
reign
affords
a
solitary
between
two
dark
periods
of
turbulence
and
ignominy
deriving
the
advantage
of
contrast
both
from
that
of
the
preceding
dynasty
and
of
a
posterity
for
whom
he
had
founded
an
empire
which
they
were
unworthy
and
unequal
to
maintain
to
such
a
tribute
i
can
add
nothing
his
greatness
consists
in
this
that
born
amidst
barbarism
he
was
yet
the
friend
of
civilization
and
understood
its
elemental
principles
and
struggled
years
to
establish
them
failing
only
because
his
successors
and
subjects
were
not
prepared
for
them
and
could
not
learn
them
until
the
severe
experience
of
ten
centuries
amidst
disasters
and
storms
should
prove
the
value
of
the
old
basal
walls
and
pillars
which
remained
unburied
amid
the
despised
ruins
of
antiquity
and
show
that
no
structure
could
adequately
shelter
the
european
nations
which
was
not
established
by
the
beautiful
union
of
german
vigor
with

by
the
combined

proved
to
be
the
most
wonderful

call
worldly
wisdom
that
our

has
seen
controlling

dictating

to
ancient
monarchies
and
binding
the
souls
of
millions
with
a
more
perfect
despotism
than
oriental

ever
sought
or
dreamed
and
what
a
marvellous
vitality
it
seems
to
have
it
has
survived
the
attacks
of
its
countless
enemies
it
has
recovered
from

of

it
still
remains
majestic
and
powerful
extending
its
arms

love
or
briarean
terror
over
half
of

as
a
temporal
government
rivalling
kings
in

pomps
of

and
the
pride
of

it
may
be
passing
away
but
as
an
organization
to
diffuse
and
conserve
religious
truths
yea
even
to
bring
a
moral
pressure
on
the
minds
of
princes
and
governors
and
reinforce
its
ranks
with
the
mighty
and
the
noble
it
seems
to
be
as
potent
as
ever
it
is
still
sending
its
missionaries
its
prelates
and
its
cardinals
into
the
heart
of
protestant
countries
who
anticipate
and
boast
of
new
victories
it
derides
the
dissensions

the

speculations
of

predicts
that

call

it

and
than

among

in

in

very
seats
of
learning
and
power
and
fashion
which
once
were
kindled
into
lofty
enthusiasm
by
the
voice
of
luther
who
is
it
that
desert
the
churches
and
disregard
the
sacraments
the
catholics
or
the
protestants
surely
such
a
power
whether
we
view
it
as
an
institution
or
as
a
religion
can
not
be
despised
even
by
the
narrowest
and
most
fanatical
protestant
it
is
too
grand
and
venerable
for
sarcasm
ridicule
or
mockery
it
is
too
potent
and
respectable
to
be
sneered
at
or
lied
about
no
cause
can
be
advanced
permanently
except
by
adherence
to
the
truth
whether
it
be
agreeable
or
not
if
the
papacy
were
a
mere
despotism
having
nothing
else
in
view
than
the
inthralment
of
mankind
of
which
it
has
been
accused
then
mankind
long
ago
in
lofty
indignation
would
have
hurled
it
from
its
venerable
throne
but
despotic
as
its
yoke
is
in
the
eyes
of
protestants
and
always
has
been
and
always
may
be
it
is
something
more
than
that
having
at
heart
the
welfare
of
the
very
millions
whom
it
rules
by
working
on
their
fears
in
spite
of
dogmas
which
are
deductions
from
questionable
premises
or
which
are
at
war
with
reason
and
ritualism
borrowed
from
other
religions
and
pious
frauds
and
jesuitical
means
to
compass
desirable
ends
which
protestants
indignantly
discard
and
which
they
maintain
are
antagonistic
to
the
spirit
of
primitive
christianity
still
it
is
also
the
defender
and
advocate
of
vital
christian
truths
to
which
we
trace
the
hopes
and
consolations
of
mankind
as
the
conservator
of
doctrines
common
to
all
christian
sects
it
can
not
be
swept
away
by
the
hand
of
man
nor
as
a
government
confining
its
officers
and
rules
to
the
spiritual
necessities
of
its
members
its
empire
is
spiritual
rather
than
temporal
temporal
monarchs
are
hurled
from
their
thrones
the
long
line
of
the
bourbons
vanishes
before
the
tempests
of
revolution
and
they
who
were
borne
into
power
by
these
tempests
are
in
turn
hurled
into
ignominious
banishment
but
the
pope
he
still
sits
secure
on
the
throne
of
the
gregories
and
the
clements
ready
to
pronounce
benedictions
or
hurl
anathemas
to
which
half
of
europe
bows
in
fear
or
love
whence
this
strange
vitality
what
are
the
elements
of
a
power
so
enduring
and
so
irresistible
what
has
given
to
it
its
greatness
and
its
dignity
i
confess
i
gaze
upon
it
as
a
peasant
surveys
a
king
as
a
boy
contemplates
a
queen
of
beauty
as
something
which
may
be
talked
about
yet
removed
beyond
our
influence
and
no
more
affected
by
our
praise
or
censure
than
is
a
procession
of
cardinals
by
the
gaze
of
admiring
spectators
in
saint
peter
church
who
can
measure
it
or
analyze
it
or
comprehend
it
the
weapons
of
reason
appear
to
fall
impotent
before
its
haughty
dogmatism
genius
can
not
reconcile
its
inconsistencies
serenely
it
sits
unmoved
amid
all
the
aggressions
of
human
thought
and
all
the
triumphs
of
modern
science
it
is
both
lofty
and
degraded
simple
yet
worldly
wise
humble
yet
scornful
and
proud
washing
beggars
feet
yet
imposing
commands
on
the

benignant

severe
on
all
who
rebel

the

there
ever
such
a

type
of

there
ever
such
a

so
subtile
its
policy
so
plausible
its
pretensions
so
certain
its

how
imposing
the
words
of
paternal
benediction
how
grand
the
liturgy

down
from
ages
of

how
absorbed

devotion

to

of
our
redemption
on

ceremony
of
the
mass
in

everywhere
are
rites

betokening
maceration
grief

penitence
the
humiliation
of
humanity
before
the
awful
power

divine
omnipotence

moral
government
no

dares
openly
to
deny

of
what
crimes
and
abominations
has
not
this
government
been
accused
if
we
go
back
to
darker
ages

accept
what

supreme
rulers
of
this
contradictory

benevolent
and

so
cruel
so
enlightened
and

so
fanatical
so

and
yet
so
proud
this

equally
renowned
for
saints

and

the
joy
and

and

shame
of
earth
there
never
were
greater
geniuses
or
greater
fools
saints
of
almost
preternatural
sanctity
like
the
first
leo
and
gregory
or
hounds
like
boniface
viii
or
alexander
vi
an
array
of
scholars
and
dunces
ascetics
and
gluttons
men
who
adorned
and
men
who
scandalized
their
lofty
position
and
yet
on
the
whole
we
are
forced
to
admit
the
most
remarkable
body
of
rulers
any
empire
has
known
since
they
were
elevated
by
their
peers
and
generally
for
talents
or
services
at
a
period
of
life
when
character
is
formed
and
experience
is
matured
they
were
not
greater
than
their
church
or
their
age
like
the
charlemagnes
and
peters
of
secular
history
but
they
were
the
picked
men
the
best
representatives
of
their
church
ambitious
doubtless
and
worldly
as
great
potentates
generally
are
but
made
so
by
the
circumstances
which
controlled
them
who
can
wield
irresponsible
power
and
not
become
arrogant
and
perhaps
it
requires
the
almost
superhuman
virtue
of
a
marcus
aurelius
or
a
saint
louis
to
crucify
the
pride
of
rank
and
power
if
the
president
of
a
college
or
of
a
railroad
or
of
a
bank
becomes
a
different
man
to
the
eye
of
an
early
friend
what
can
be
expected
of
those
who
are
raised
above
public
opinion
and
have
no
fetters
on
their
wills
men
who
are
regarded
as
infallible
and
feel
themselves
supreme
but
of
all
these
three
hundred
or
four
hundred
men
who
have
swayed
the
destinies
of
europe
an
uninterrupted
line
of
pontiffs
for
fifteen
hundred
years
or
more
no
one
is
so
famous
as
gregory
vii
for
the
grandeur
of
his
character
the
heroism
of
his
struggles
and
the
posthumous
influence
of
his
deeds
he
was
too
great
a
man
to
be
called
by
his
papal
title
he
is
best
known
by
his
baptismal
name
hildebrand
the
greatest
hero
of
the
roman
church
there
are
some
men
whose
titles
add
nothing
to
their
august
names
david
julius
constantine
augustine
when
a
man
has
become
very
eminent
we
drop
titles
altogether
except
in
military
life
we
say
daniel
webster
edward
everett
jonathan
edwards
thomas
jefferson
benjamin
franklin
william
pitt
hildebrand
is
a
greater
name
than
gregory
and
with
him
is
identified
the
greatest
struggle
of
the
papacy
against
the
temporal
powers
i
do
not
aim
to
dissect
his
character
so
much
as
to
present
his
services
to
the
church
i
wish
to
show
why
and
how
he
is
identified
with
movements
of
supreme
historical
importance
it
would
be
easy
to
make
him
out
a
saint
and
martyr
and
equally
so
to
paint
him
as
a
tyrant
and
usurper
it
is
of
little
consequence
to
us
whether
he
was
ascetic
or
ambitious
or
unscrupulous
but
it
of
consequence
to
show
the
majestic
power
of
those
ideas
by
which
he
ruled
the
middle
ages
and
which
will
never
pass
away
as
sublime
agencies
so
long
as
men
are
ignorant
and
superstitious
as
a
man
he
no
longer
lives
but
his
thunderbolts
are
perpetual
powers
since
they
still
alarm
the
fears
of
men
still
his
personal
history
is
not
uninteresting
born
of
humble
parents
in
italy
in
the
year
the
son
of
a
carpenter
he
rose
by
genius
and
virtue
to
the
highest
offices
and
dignities
but
his
greatness
was
in
force
of
character
rather
than
original
ideas
like
that
of
washington
or
william
or
the
duke
of
wellington
he
had
not
the
comprehensive
intellect
of
charlemagne
nor
the
creative
genius
of
peter
of
russia
but
he
had
the
sagacity
of
richelieu
and
the
iron
will
of
napoleon
he
was
statesman
as
well
as
priest
marvellous
for
his
activity
insight
into
human
nature
vast
executive
abilities
and
dauntless
heroism
he
comprehended
the
only
way
whereby
christendom
could
be
governed
and
unscrupulously
used
the
means
of
success
he
was
not
a
great
scholar
or
theologian
or
philosopher
but
a
man
of
action
embracing
opportunities
and
striking
decisive
blows
from
first
to
last
he
was
devoted
to
his
cause
which
was
greater
than
himself
even
the
spiritual
supremacy
of
the
papacy
i
do
not
read
of
great
intellectual
precocity
like
that
of
cicero
and
william
pitt
nor
of
great
attainments
like
those
of
ab√©lard
and
thomas
aquinas
nor
even
an
insight
like
that
of
bacon
into
what
constitutes
the
dignity
of
man
and
the
true
glory
of
civilization
but
like
ambrose
and
the
first
leo
he
was
early
selected
for
important
missions
and
responsible
trusts
all
of
which
he
discharged
with
great
fidelity
and
ability
his
education
was
directed
by
the
monks
of
cluny
that
princely
abbey
in
burgundy
where
monks
were
sovereigns
and
sovereigns
were
monks
like
all
earnest
monks
he
was
ascetic
devotional
and
like
all
men
ambitious
to
rule
he
learned
how
to
obey
he
pondered
on
the
holy
scriptures
as
well
as
on
the
canons
of
the
church
so
marked
a
man
was
he
that
he
was
early
chosen
as
prior
of
his
convent
and
so
great
were
his
personal
magnetism
eloquence
and
influence
that
he
induced
bruno
the
bishop
of
toul
when
elected
pope
by
the
emperor
of
germany
to
lay
aside
the
badges
and
vestments
of
the
pontifical
office
and
refuse
his
title
until
he
should
be
elected
by
the
clergy
and
people
of
rome
thus
showing
that
at
the
age
of
he
comprehended
the
issues
of
the
day
and
meditated
on
the
gigantic
changes
it
was
necessary
to
make
before
the
pope
could
be
the
supreme
ruler
of
christendom
the
autocratic
idea
of
leo
and
the
great
gregory
who
sent
his
missionaries
to
england
was
that
to
which
hildebrand
ardent
soul
clung
with
preternatural
earnestness
as
the
only
government
fit
for
turbulent
and
superstitious
ages
he
did
not
originate
this
idea
but
he
defended
and
enforced
it
as
had
never
been
done
before
so
that
to
many
minds
he
was
the
great
architect
of
the
papal
structure
it
was
a
rare
spectacle
to
see
a
sovereign
pontiff
lay
aside
the
insignia
of
his
grandeur
at
the
bidding
of
this
monk
of
cluny
it
was
grander
to
see
this
monk
laying
the
foundation
of
an
irresistible
despotism
which
was
to
last
beyond
the
time
of
luther
not
merely
was
leo
ix
his
tool
but
three
successive
popes
were
chosen
at
his
dictation
and
when
he
became
cardinal
and
archdeacon
he
seems
to
have
been
the
inspiring
genius
of
the
papal
government
undertaking
the
most
important
missions
curbing
the
turbulent
spirit
of
the
roman
princes
and
assisting
in
all
ecclesiastical
councils
it
was
by
his
suggestion
that
abbots
were
deposed
and
bishops
punished
and
monarchs
reprimanded
he
was
the
prime
minister
of
four
popes
before
he
accepted
that
high
office
to
which
he
doubtless
had
aspired
while
meditating
as
a
monk
amid
the
sunny
slopes
of
cluny
since
he
knew
that
the
exigences
of
the
church
required
a
bold
and
able
ruler
and
who
in
christendom
was
bolder
and
more
than
he
he
might
have
been
elevated
to
the
chair
of
saint
peter
at
an
earlier
period
but
he
was
contented
with
power
rather
than
glory
knowing
that
his
day
would
come
and
at
a
time
when
his
extraordinary
abilities
would
be
most
needed
he
could
afford
to
wait
and
no
man
is
truly
great
who
can
not
bide
his
time
at
last
hildebrand
received
the
reward
of
his
great
services
a
reward
says
stephen
which
he
had
long
contemplated
but
which
with
policy
he
had
so
long
declined
in
the
year
hildebrand
became
gregory
and
his
memorable
pontificate
began
as
a
reformer
of
the
abuses
of
his
age
and
the
intrepid
defender
of
that
unlimited
and
absolute
despotism
which
inthralled
not
merely
the
princes
of
europe
but
the
mind
of
christendom
itself
it
was
he
who
not
only
proclaimed
the
liberties
of
the
people
against
nobles
and
made
the
church
an
asylum
for
misery
and
oppression
but
who
realized
the
idea
that
the
church
was
the
mother
of
spiritual
principles
and
that
the
spiritual
authority
should
be
raised
over
all
temporal
power
in
the
great
crises
of
states
and
empires
deliverers
seem
to
be
raised
up
by
divine
providence
to
restore
peace
and
order
and
maintain
the
first
condition
of
society
or
extricate
nations
from
overwhelming
calamities
thus
charlemagne
appeared
at
the
right
time
to
prevent
the
overthrow
of
europe
by
new
waves
of
barbaric
invasion
thus
william
the
silent
preserved
the
nationality
of
holland
and
gustavus
adolphus
gave
religious
liberty
to
germany
when
persecution
was
apparently
successful
thus
richelieu
undermined
feudalism
in
france
and
established
absolutism
as
one
of
the
needed
forces
of
his
turbulent
age
even
as
napoleon
gave
law
and
order
to
france
when
distracted
by
the
anarchism
of
a
revolution
which
did
not
comprehend
the
liberty
which
was
invoked
so
hildebrand
was
raised
up
to
establish
the
only
government
which
could
rescue
europe
from
the
rapacities
of
feudal
nobles
and
establish
law
and
order
in
the
hands
of
the
most
enlightened
class
so
that
like
peter
the
great
he
looms
up
as
a
reformer
as
well
as
a
despot
he
appears
in
a
double
light
now
you
ask
what
were
his
reforms
and
what
were
his
schemes
of
aggrandizement
for
which
we
honor
him
while
we
denounce
him
we
can
not
see
the
reforms
he
attempted
without
glancing
at
the
enormous
evils
which
stared
him
in
the
face
society
in
europe
in
the
eleventh
century
was
nearly
as
dark
and
degraded
as
it
was
on
the
fall
of
the
merovingian
dynasty
in
some
respects
it
had
reached
the
lowest
depth
of
wretchedness
which
the
middle
ages
ever
saw
never
had
the
clergy
been
more
ignorant
more
sensual
and
more
worldly
they
had
not
the
piety
of
the
fourth
century
nor
the
intelligence
of
the
sixteenth
century
they
were
powerful
and
wealthy
but
exceedingly
corrupt
monastic
institutions
covered
the
face
of
europe
but
the
monks
had
sadly
departed
from
the
virtues
which
partially
redeemed
the
miseries
that
succeeded
the
fall
of
the
roman
empire
the
lives
of
the
clergy
regular
and
secular
still
compared
favorably
with
the
lives
of
the
feudal
nobility
who
had
in
addition
to
priestly
vices
the
vices
of
robbers
and
bandits
but
still
the
clergy
were
notoriously
ignorant
superstitious
and
sensual
monasteries
sought
to
be
independent
of
all
foreign
control
and
of
episcopal
jurisdiction
they
had
been
enormously
enriched
by
princes
and
barons
and
they
owned
with
the
other
clergy
half
the
lands
of
europe
and
more
than
half
its
silver
and
gold
the
monks
fattened
on
all
the
luxuries
which
then
were
known
they
neglected
the
rules
of
their
order
and
lived
in
idleness
spending
their
time
in
the
chase
or
in
taverns
and
brothels
hardly
a
great
scholar
or
theologian
had
arisen
among
them
since
the
patristic
age
with
the
exception
of
a
few
schoolmen
like
anselm
and
peter
lombard
saint
bernard
had
not
yet
appeared
to
reform
the
benedictines
nor
dominic
and
saint
francis
to
found
new
orders
gluttony
and
idleness
were
perhaps
the
characteristic
vices
of
the
great
body
of
the
monks
who
numbered
over
one
hundred
thousand
hunting
and
hawking
were
the
most
innocent
of
their
amusements
they
have
been
accused
of
drinking
toasts
in
honor
of
the
devil
and
celebrating
mass
in
a
state
of
intoxication
not
one
in
a
thousand
says
hallam
could
address
to
one
another
a
common
letter
of
salutation
they
were
a
walking
libel
on
everything
sacred
read
the
account
of
their
banquets
in
the
annals
which
have
come
down
to
us
of
the
tenth
and
eleventh
centuries
when
convents
were
so
numerous
and
rich
if
dugdale
is
to
be
credited
their
gluttony
exceeded
that
of
any
previous
or
succeeding
age
their
cupidity
their
drunken
revels
their
infamous
haunts
their
disgusting
coarseness
their
hypocrisy
ignorance
selfishness
and
superstition
were
notorious
yet
the
monks
were
not
worse
than
the
secular
clergy
high
and
low
bishoprics
and
all
benefices
were
bought
and
sold
canons
were
trodden
under
foot
ancient
traditions
were
turned
out
of
doors
old
customs
were
laid
aside
boys
were
made
archbishops
ludicrous
stories
were
recited
in
the
churches
the
most
disgraceful
crimes
were
pardoned
for
money
desolation
according
to
cardinal
baronius
was
seen
in
the
temples
of
the
lord
as
petrarch
said
of
avignon
in
a
better
age
there
is
no
pity
no
charity
no
faith
no
fear
of
god
the
air
the
streets
the
houses
the
markets
the
beds
the
hotels
the
churches
even
the
altars
consecrated
to
god
are
all
peopled
with
knaves
and
liars
or
to
use
the
still
stronger
language
of
a
great
reviewer
the
gates
of
hell
appeared
to
roll
back
on
their
infernal
hinges
that
there
might
go
forth
malignant
spirits
to
empty
the
vials
of
wrath
on
the
patrimony
even
of
the
great
chief
of
the
apostles
these
vices
it
is
true
were
not
confined
to
the
clergy
all
classes
were
alike
forlorn
miserable
and
corrupt
it
was
a
gloomy
period
the
church
whenever
religious
was
sad
and
despairing
the
contemplative
hid
themselves
in
noisome
and
sepulchral
crypts
the
inspiring
chants
of
ambrose
gave
place
to
gloomy
and
monotonous
antiphonal
singing
that
is
when
the
monks
confined
themselves
to
their
dismal
vocation
what
was
especially
needed
was
a
reform
among
the
clergy
themselves
they
indeed
owned
their
allegiance
to
the
pope
as
the
supreme
head
of
the
church
but
their
fealty
was
becoming
a
mockery
they
could
not
support
the
throne
of
absolutism
if
they
were
not
respected
by
the
laity
baronial
and
feudal
power
was
rapidly
gaining
over
spiritual
and
this
was
a
poor
exchange
for
the
power
of
the
clergy
if
it
led
to
violence
and
rapine
it
is
to
maintain
law
and
order
justice
and
safety
that
all
governments
are
established
hildebrand
saw
and
lamented
the
countless
evils
of
the
day
especially
those
which
were
loosening
the
bands
of
clerical
obedience
and
undermining
the
absolutism
which
had
become
the
great
necessity
of
his
age
he
made
up
his
mind
to
reform
these
evils
no
pope
before
him
had
seriously
undertaken
this
gigantic
task
the
popes
who
for
two
hundred
years
had
preceded
him
were
a
scandal
and
a
reproach
to
their
exalted
position
these
heirs
of
saint
peter
wasted
their
patrimony
in
pleasures
and
pomps
at
no
period
of
the
papal
history
was
the
papal
chair
filled
with
such
bad
or
incompetent
men
of
these
popes
two
were
murdered
five
were
driven
into
exile
and
four
were
deposed
some
were
raised
to
prominence
by
arms
and
others
by
money
john
commanded
an
army
in

john
xi
died
in
a
fit
of
debauchery
and

xii
was
murdered

one
of
the
infamous
women
whom
he
patronized
benedict
ix
was
driven
from
the
throne
by
robbery
and
murder
while
gregory
vi
purchased
the
papal
dignity
for
two
hundred
years
no
commanding
character
had
worn
the
tiara
hildebrand
however
set
a
new
example
and
became
a
watchful
shepherd
of
his
fold
his
private
life
was
without
reproach
he
was
absorbed
in
his
duties
he
sympathized
with
learning
and
learned
men
he
was
the
friend
of
lanfranc
and
it
was
by
his
influence
that
this
great
prelate
was
appointed
to
the
see
of
canterbury
and
a
closer
union
was
formed
with
england
he
infused
by
his
example
a
quiet
but
noble
courage
into
the
soul
of
anselm
he
had
great
faults
of
course
faults
of
his
own
and
faults
of
his
age
i
wonder
why
so
a
man
has
escaped
the
admiring
eulogium
of
carlyle
guizot
compares
him
with
the
russian
peter
in
some
respects
he
reminds
me
of
oliver
cromwell
since
both
equally
deplored
the
evils
of
the
day
and
both
invoked
the
aid
of
god
almighty
both
were
ambitious
and
unscrupulous
in
the
use
of
tools
neither
of
them
was
stained
by
vulgar
vices
nor
seduced
from
his
course
by
love
of
ease
or
pleasure
both
are
to
be
contemplated
in
the
double
light
of
reformer
and
usurper
both
were
honest
and
both
were
unscrupulous
honest
in
seeking
to
promote
public
morality
and
the
welfare
of
society
and
unscrupulous
in
the
arts
by
which
their
power
was
gained
that
which
filled
the
soul
of
hildebrand
with
especial
grief
was
the
alienation
of
the
clergy
from
their
highest
duties
their
worldly
lives
and
their
frail
support
in
his
efforts
to
elevate
the
spiritual
power
therefore
he
determined
to
make
a
reform
of
the
clergy
themselves
having
in
view
all
the
time
their
assistance
in
establishing
the
papal
supremacy
he
attacked
the
clergy
where
they
were
weakest
they
the
secular
ones
the
parish
priests
were
getting
married
especially
in
germany
and
france
they
were
setting
at
defiance
the
laws
of
celibacy
they
not
only
sought
wives
but
they
lived
in
concubinage
now
celibacy
had
been
regarded
as
the
supernal
virtue
from
the
time
of
saint
jerome
it
was
supposed
to
be
a
state
most
favorable
to
christian
perfection
it
animated
the
existence
of
the
most
noted
saints
says
jerome
take
axe
in
hand
and
hew
down
the
sterile
tree
of
marriage
this
notion
of
the
superior
virtue
of
virginity
was
one
of
the
fruits
of
those
eastern
theogonies
which
were
engrafted
on
the
early
church
growing
out
of
the
oriental
idea
of
the
inalienable
evil
of
matter
it
was
one
of
the
fundamental
principles
of
monasticism
and
monasticism
wherever
born
whether
in
india
or
the
syrian
deserts
was
one
of
the
established
institutions
of
the
church
it
was
indorsed
by
benedict
as
well
as
by
basil
it
had
taken
possession
of
the
minds
of
the
gothic
nations
more
firmly
even
than
of
the
eastern
the
east
never
saw
such
monasteries
as
those
which
covered
italy
france
germany
and
england
they
were
more
needed
among
the
feudal
robbers
of
europe
than
in
the
effeminate
monarchies
of
asia
moreover
it
was
in
monasteries
that
the
popes
had
ever
found
their
strongest
adherents
their
most
zealous
supporters
without
the
aid
of
convents
the
papal
empire
might
have
crumbled
monasticism
and
the
papacy
were
strongly
allied
one
supported
the
other
so
efficient
were
monastic
institutions
in
advocating
the
idea
of
a
theocracy
as
upheld
by
the
popes
that
they
were
exempted
from
episcopal
authority
an
abbot
was
as
powerful
and
independent
as
a
bishop
but
to
make
the
papacy
supreme
it
was
necessary
to
call
in
the
aid
of
the
secular
priests
likewise
unmarried
priests
being
more
like
monks
were
more
efficient
supporters
of
the
papal
throne
to
maintain
celibacy
therefore
was
always
in
accordance
with
papal
policy
but
nature
had
gradually
asserted
its
claims
over
tradition
and
authority
the
clergy
especially
in
france
and
germany
were
setting
at
defiance
the
edicts
of
popes
and
councils
the
glory
of
celibacy
was
in
an
eclipse
no
one
comprehended
the
necessity
of
celibacy
among
the
clergy
more
clearly
than
hildebrand
himself
a
monk
by
education
and
sympathy
he
looked
upon
married
life
with
all
its
hallowed
beauty
as
a
profanation
for
a
priest
in
his
eyes
the
clergy
were
married
only
to
the
church
domestic
affections
suited
ill
with
the
duties
of
a
theocratic
ministry
anything
which
diverted
the
labors
of
the
clergy
from
the
church
seemed
to
him
an
outrage
and
a
degeneracy
how
could
they
reach
the
state
of
beatific
existence
if
they
were
to
listen
to
the
prattle
of
children
or
be
engrossed
with
the
joys
of
conjugal
or
parental
love
so
he
assembled
a
council
and
caused
it
to
pass
canons
to
the
effect
that
married
priests
should
not
perform
any
clerical
office
that
the
people
should
not
even
be
present
at
mass
celebrated
by
them
that
all
who
had
wives
or
concubines
as
he
called
them
should
put
them
away
and
that
no
one
should
be
ordained
who
did
not
promise
to
remain
unmarried
during
his
whole
life
of
course
there
was
a
violent
opposition
a
great
outcry
was
raised
especially
in
germany
the
whole
body
of
the
secular
priests
exclaimed
against
the
proceeding
at
mentz
they
threatened
the
life
of
the
archbishop
who
attempted
to
enforce
the
decree
at
paris
a
numerous
synod
was
assembled
in
which
it
was
voted
that
gregory
ought
not
here
to
be
obeyed
but
gregory
was
stronger
than
his
rebellious
clergy
stronger
than
the
instincts
of
human
nature
stronger
than
the
united
voice
of
reason
and
scripture
he
fell
back
on
the
majestic
power
of
prevailing
ideas
on
the
ascetic
element
of
the
early
church
on
the
traditions
of
monastic
life
he
was
supported
by
more
than
a
hundred
thousand
monks
by
the
superstitions
of
primitive
ages
by
the
example
of
saints
and
martyrs
by
his
own
elevated
rank
by
the
allegiance
due
to
him
as
head
of
the
church
excommunications
were
hurled
like
thunderbolts
into
remotest
hamlets
and
the
murmurs
of
indignant
christendom
were
silenced
by
the
awful
denunciations
of
supposed
vicegerent
the
clergy
succumbed
before
such
a
terrible
spiritual
force
the
fear
of
hell
the
great
idea
by
which
the
priests
themselves
controlled
their
flocks
was
more
potent
than
any
temporal
good
what
priest
in
that
age
would
dare
resist
his
spiritual
monarch
on
almost
any
point
and
especially
when
disobedience
was
supposed
to
entail
the
burnings
of
a
physical
hell
forever
and
ever
so
celibacy
was
as
a
law
of
the
christian
church
at
the
bidding
of
that
genius
who
had
devised
the
means
of
spiritual
despotism
that
law
so
gloomy
so
unnatural
so
fraught
with
evil
has
never
been
repealed
it
still
rules
the
catholic
priesthood
of
europe
and
america
nor
will
it
be
repealed
so
long
as
the
ideas
of
the
middle
ages
have
more
force
than
enlightened
reason
it
is
an
abominable
law
but
who
can
doubt
its
efficacy
in
cementing
the
power
of
the
popes
but
simony
or
the
sale
of
ecclesiastical
benefices
was
a
still
more
alarming
evil
to
the
mind
of
gregory
it
was
the
great
scandal
of
the
church
and
age
here
we
honor
the
pope
for
striving
to
remove
it
and
yet
its
abolition
was
no
easy
thing
he
came
in
contact
with
the
selfishness
of
barons
and
kings
he
found
it
an
easier
matter
to
take
away
the
wives
of
priests
than
the
purses
of
princes
priests
who
had
vowed
obedience
might
consent
to
the
repudiation
of
their
wives
but
would
great
temporal
robbers
part
with
their
spoils
the
sale
of
benefices
was
one
great
source
of
royal
and
baronial
revenues
bishoprics
once
conferred
for
wisdom
and
piety
had
become
prizes
for
the
rapacious
and
ambitious
bishops
and
abbots
were
most
frequently
chosen
from
the
ranks
of
the
great
powerful
sees
were
the
gifts
of
kings
to
their
favorites
or
families
or
were
bought
by
the
wealthy
so
that
worldly
or
incapable
men
were
made
overseers
of
the
church
of
christ
the
clergy
were
in
danger
of
being
hopelessly
secularized
and
the
evil
spread
to
the
extremities
of
the
clerical
body
the
princes
and
barons
were
getting
control
of
the
church
itself
bishops
often
possessed
a
plurality
of
sees
children
were
elevated
to
episcopal
thrones
sycophants
courtiers
jesters
imbecile
sons
of
princes
became
great
ecclesiastical
dignitaries
who
can
wonder
at
the
degeneracy
of
the
clergy
when
they
held
their
cures
at
the
hands
of
lay
patrons
to
whom
they
swore
allegiance
for
the
temporalities
of
their
benefices
even
the
ring
and
the
crozier
the
emblems
of
spiritual
authority
once
received
at
the
hand
of
metropolitan
archbishops
alone
were
now
bestowed
by
temporal
sovereigns
who
claimed
thereby
fealty
and
allegiance
so
that
princes
had
gradually
usurped
the
old
rights
of
the
church
and
gregory
resolved
to
recover
them
so
long
as
emperors
and
kings
could
fill
the
rich
bishoprics
and
abbacies
with
their
creatures
the
papal
dominion
was
weakened
in
its
most
vital
point
and
might
become
a
dream
this
evil
was
rapidly
undermining
the
whole
ecclesiastical
edifice
and
it
required
a
hero
of
prodigious
genius
energy
and
influence
to
reform
it
hildebrand
saw
and
comprehended
the
whole
extent
and
bearing
of
the
evil
and
resolved
to
remove
it
or
die
in
the
attempt
it
was
not
only
undermining
his
throne
but
was
secularizing
the
church
and
destroying
the
real
power
of
the
clergy
he
made
up
his
mind
to
face
the
difficulty
in
its
most
dreaded
quarters
he
knew
that
the
attempt
to
remove
this
scandal
would
entail
a
desperate
conflict
with
the
princes
of
the
earth
before
this
popes
and
princes
were
generally
leagued
together
they
played
into
each
other
hands
but
now
a
battle
was
to
be
fought
between
the
temporal
and
spiritual
powers
he
knew
that
princes
would
never
relinquish
so
lucrative
a
source
of
profit
as
the
sale
of
powerful
sees
unless
the
right
to
sell
them
were
taken
away
by
some
tremendous
conflict
he
therefore
prepared
for
the
fight
and
forged
his
weapons
and
gathered
together
his
forces
nor
would
he
waste
time
by
idle
negotiations
it
was
necessary
to
act
with
promptness
and
vigor
no
matter
how
great
the
danger
no
matter
how
powerful
his
enemies
the
church
was
in
peril
and
he
resolved
to
come
to
the
rescue
cost
what
it
might
what
was
his
life
compared
with
the
sale
of
god
heritage
for
what
was
he
placed
in
the
most
exalted
post
of
the
church
if
not
to
defend
her
in
an
alarming
crisis
in
resolving
to
separate
forever
the
spiritual
from
the
temporal
power
hildebrand
followed
in
the
footsteps
of
ambrose
but
he
had
also
deeper
designs
he
resolved
to
raise
if
possible
the
spiritual
the
temporal
power
kings
should
be
subject
to
the
church
not
the
church
to
the
kings
of
the
earth
he
believed
that
he
was
the
appointed
vicar
of
the
almighty
to
rule
the
world
in
peace
on
the
principles
of
eternal
love
that
christ
had
established
a
new
theocracy
and
had
delegated
his
power
to
the
apostle
peter
which
had
descended
to
the
pope
as
the
apostle
legitimate
successor
i
say
nothing
here
of
this
monstrous
claim
of
this
ingenious
falsehood
on
which
the
monarchical
power
of
the
papacy
rests
it
is
the
great
fraud
of
the
middle
ages
and
yet
but
for
this
theocratic
idea
it
is
difficult
to
see
how
the
external
unity
of
the
church
could
have
been
preserved
among
the
of
europe
and
what
a
necessary
thing
it
was
in
ages
of
superstition
ignorance
and
anarchy
to
preserve
the
unity
of
the
church
to
establish
a
spiritual
power
which
should
awe
and
control
barbaric
princes
there
are
two
sides
to
the
supremacy
of
the
popes
as
head
of
the
church
when
we
consider
the
aspect
and
state
of
society
in
those
iron
and
lawless
times
would
providence
have
permitted
such
a
power
to
rule
for
a
thousand
years
had
it
not
been
a
necessity
at
any
rate
this
is
too
complicated
a
question
for
me
to
discuss
it
is
enough
for
me
to
describe
the
conflict
for
principles
not
to
attempt
to
settle
them
in
this
matter
i
am
not
a
partisan
but
a
painter
i
seek
to
describe
a
battle
not
to
defend
either
this
cause
or
that
i
have
my
opinions
but
this
is
no
place
to
present
them
i
seek
to
describe
simply
the
great
battle
of
the
middle
ages
and
you
can
draw
your
own
conclusions
as
to
the
merits
of
the
respective
causes
i
present
the
battle
of
heroes
a
battle
worthy
of
the
muse
of
homer
hildebrand
in
this
battle
disdained
to
fight
with
any
but
great
and
noble
antagonists
as
the
friend
of
the
poor
man
crushed
and
mocked
by
a
cold
and
unfeeling
nobility
as
the
protector
of
the
church
in
danger
of
being
subverted
by
the
unhallowed
tyranny
and
greed
of
princes
as
the
consecrated
monarch
of
a
great
spiritual
fraternity
he
resolved
to
face
the
mightiest
monarchs
and
suffer
and
if
need
be
die
for
a
cause
which
he
regarded
as
the
hope
and
salvation
of
europe
therefore
he
convened
another
council
and
prohibited
under
the
terrible
penalty
of
excommunication
for
that
was
his
mighty
weapon
the
investiture
of
bishoprics
and
abbacies
at
the
hands
of
laymen
only
he
himself
should
give
to
ecclesiastics
the
ring
and
the
crozier
the
badges
of
spiritual
authority
and
he
equally
threatened
with
eternal
fire
any
bishop
or
abbot
who
should
receive
his
dignity
from
the
hand
of
a
prince
this
decree
was
especially
aimed
against
the
emperor
of
germany
to
whom
as
liege
lord
the
pope
himself
owed
fealty
and
obedience
henry
iv
was
one
of
the
mightiest
monarchs
of
the
franconian
dynasty
a
great
warrior
and
a
great
man
beloved
by
his
subjects
and
feared
by
the
princes
of
europe
but
he
as
well
as
gregory
was
resolved
to
maintain
the
rights
of
his
predecessors
he
also
perceived
the
importance
of
the
approaching
contest
and
what
a
contest
the
spiritual
and
temporal
powers
were
now
to
be
arrayed
against
each
other
in
a
fierce
antagonism
the
apparent
object
of
contention
changed
it
was
not
merely
simony
it
was
as
to
who
should
be
the
supreme
master
of
germany
and
italy
the
emperor
or
the
pope
to
whom
in
the
eyes
of
contemporaries
would
victory
incline
to
the
son
of
a
carpenter
speaking
in
the
name
of
the
church
and
holding
in
his
hands
the
consecrated
weapon
of
excommunication
or
the
most
powerful
monarch
of
his
age
armed
with
the
secular
sword
and
seeking
to
restore
the
dignity
of
roman
emperors
the
pope
is
supported
by
the
monks
the
inferior
clergy
and
the
vast
spiritual
powers
universally
supposed
to
be
delegated
to
him
by
christ
as
the
successor
of
saint
peter
the
emperor
is
supported
by
large
feudal
armies
and
all
the
prestige
of
the
successors
of
charlemagne
if
the
pope
appeals
to
an
ancient
custom
of
the
church
the
emperor
appeals
to
a
general
feudal
custom
which
required
bishops
and
abbots
to
pay
their
homage
to
him
for
the
temporalities
of
their
sees
the
pope
has
the
canons
of
the
church
on
his
side
the
emperor
the
laws
of
feudalism
and
both
the
canons
of
the
church
and
feudal
principles
are
binding
obligations
hitherto
they
have
not
clashed
but
now
feudalism
very
generally
established
and
papal
absolutism
rapidly
culminating
are
to
meet
in
angry
collision
shall
the
kings
of
the
earth
prevail
assisted
by
feudal
armies
and
outward
grandeur
and
sustained
by
such
powerful
sentiments
as
loyalty
and
chivalry
or
shall
a
priest
speaking
in
the
name
of
god
almighty
and
appealing
to
the
future
fears
of
men
what
conflict
grander
and
more
sublime
than
this
in
the
whole
history
of
society
what
conflict
proved
more
momentous
in
its
results
i
need
not
trace
all
the
steps
of
that
memorable
contest
or
describe
the
details
from
the
time
when
the
pope
sent
out
his
edicts
and
excommunicated
all
who
dared
to
disobey
him
including
some
of
the
most
eminent
german
prelates
and
german
princes
henry
at
this
time
was
engaged
in
a
desperate
war
with
the
saxons
and
gregory
seized
this
opportunity
to
summon
the
emperor
his
emperor
to
appear
before
him
at
rome
and
answer
for
alleged
crimes
against
the
saxon
church
was
there
ever
such
audacity
how
could
henry
help
giving
way
to
passionate
indignation
he
the
successor
of
the
roman
caesars
sovereign
lord
of
germany
and
italy
summoned
to
the
bar
of
a
priest
and
that
priest
his
own
subject
in
a
temporal
sense
he
was
filled
with
wrath
and
defiance
and
at
once
summoned
a
council
of
german
bishops
at
worms
who
denounced
the
pope
as
a
usurper
a
simonist
a
murderer
a
worshipper
of
the
devil
and
pronounced
upon
him
the
empty
sentence
of
a
deposition
the
aged
hildebrand
in
the
words
of
stephen
was
holding
a
council
in
the
second
week
of
lent
beneath
the
sculptured
roof
of
the
vatican
arrayed
in
the
rich
and
mystic
vestments
of
pontifical
dominion
and
the
papal
choir
were
chanting
those
immortal
anthems
which
had
come
down
from
blessed
saints
and
martyrs
when
the
messenger
of
the
emperor
presented
himself
before
the
assembled
hierarchy
of
rome
and
with
insolent
demeanor
and
abrupt
speech
delivered
the
sentence
of
the
german
council
he
was
left
unharmed
by
the
indignant
pontiff
but
the
next
day
ascending
his
throne
and
in
presence
of
the
dignitaries
of
his
church
thus
invoked
the
assistance
of
the
pretended
founder
of
his
empire
saint
peter
lend
us
your
ears
and
listen
to
your
servant
whom
you
have
cherished
from
his
infancy
and
all
the
saints
also
bear
witness
how
the
roman
church
raised
me
by
force
and
against
my
will
to
this
high
dignity
although
i
should
have
preferred
to
spend
my
days
in
a
continual
pilgrimage
than
to
ascend
thy
pulpit
for
any
human
motive
and
inasmuch
as
i
think
it
will
be
grateful
to
you
that
those
intrusted
to
my
care
should
obey
me
therefore
supported
by
these
hopes
and
for
the
honor
and
defence
of
the
church
in
the
name
of
the
omnipotent
god
father
son
and
holy
ghost
by
my
authority
and
power
i
prohibit
king
henry
who
with
pride
has
raised
himself
against
your
church
from
governing
the
kingdoms
of
germany
and
italy
i
absolve
all
christians
from
the
oath
they
have
taken
to
him
and
i
forbid
all
men
to
yield
to
him
that
service
which
is
due
unto
a
king
finally
i
bind
him
with
the
bonds
of
anathema
that
all
people
may
know
that
thou
art
peter
and
that
upon
thee
the
son
of
god
hath
built
his
church
against
which
the
gates
of
hell
can
not
prevail
this
was
an
excommunication
and
we
in
these
days
have
but
a
faint
idea
what
a
dreadful
thing
it
was
especially
when
accompanied
with
an
interdict
the
churches
were
everywhere
shut
the
dead
were
unburied
in
consecrated
ground
the
rites
of
religion
were
suspended
gloom
and
fear
sat
on
every
countenance
desolation
overspread
the
land
the
king
was
regarded
as
guilty
and
damned
his
ministers
looked
upon
him
as
a
samson
shorn
of
his
locks
his
very
wife
feared
contamination
from
his
society
his
children
as
a
man
blasted
with
the
malediction
of
heaven
when
a
man
was
universally
supposed
to
be
cursed
in
the
house
and
in
the
field
in
the
wood
and
in
the
church
in
eating
or
drinking
in
fasting
or
sleeping
in
working
or
resting
in
his
arms
in
his
legs
in
his
heart
and
in
his
head
living
or
dying
in
this
world
and
in
the
next
what
could
he
do
and
what
could
henry
do
with
all
his
greatness
his
victorious
armies
deserted
him
a
rival
prince
laid
claim
to
his
throne
his
enemies
multiplied
his
difficulties
thickened
new
dangers
surrounded
him
on
every
side
if
loyalty
that
potent
principle
had
summoned
one
hundred
thousand
warriors
to
his
camp
a
principle
much
more
powerful
than
loyalty
the
fear
of
hell
had
dispersed
them
even
his
friends
joined
the
pope
the
sainted
agnes
his
own
mother
acquiesced
in
the
sentence
the
countess
matilda
the
richest
lady
in
the
world
threw
all
her
treasures
at
the
feet
of
her
spiritual
monarch
the
moral
sentiments
of
his
own
subjects
were
turned
against
him
he
was
regarded
as
justly
condemned
the
great
princes
of
germany
sought
his
deposition
the
world
rejected
him
the
church
abandoned
him
and
god
had
forsaken
him
he
was
prostrate
helpless
disarmed
ruined
true
he
made
superhuman
efforts
he
traversed
his
empire
with
the
hope
of
rallying
his
subjects
he
flew
from
city
to
city
but
all
in
vain
every
convent
every
castle
every
city
of
his
vast
dominions
beheld
in
him
the
visitation
of
the
almighty
the
diadem
was
obscured
by
the
tiara
and
loyalty
itself
yielded
to
the
superior
potency
of
religious
fear
only
bertha
his
neglected
wife
was
faithful
and
trusting
in
that
gloomy
day
all
else
had
defrauded
and
betrayed
him
how
bitter
his
humiliation
and
yet
his
haughty
foe
was
not
contented
with
the
punishment
he
had
inflicted
he
declared
that
if
the
sun
went
down
on
the
of
february
before
henry
was
restored
to
the
bosom
of
the
church
his
crown
should
be
transferred
to
another
that
inexorable
old
pontiff
laid
claim
to
the
right
of
giving
and
taking
away
imperial
crowns
was
ever
before
seen
such
arrogance
and
audacity
in
a
priest
and
yet
he
knew
that
he
would
be
sustained
he
knew
that
his
supremacy
was
based
on
a
universally
recognized
idea
who
can
resist
the
ideas
of
his
age
henry
might
have
resisted
if
resistance
had
been
possible
even
he
must
yield
to
irresistible
necessity
he
was
morally
certain
that
he
would
lose
his
crown
and
be
in
danger
of
losing
his
soul
unless
he
made
his
peace
with
his
dangerous
enemy
it
was
necessary
that
the
awful
curse
should
be
removed
he
had
no
remedy
only
one
course
was
before
him
he
must
yield
not
to
man
alone
but
to
an
idea
which
had
the
force
of
fate
wonder
not
that
he
made
up
his
mind
to
submit
he
was
great
but
not
greater
than
his
age
how
few
men
are
mohammed
could
renounce
prevailing
idolatries
luther
could
burn
a
papal
bull
but
the
emperor
of
germany
could
not
resist
the
supposed
vicegerent
of
the
almighty
behold
then
the
melancholy
pitiable
spectacle
of
this
mighty
monarch
in
the
depth
of
winter
and
a
winter
of
unprecedented
severity
crossing
in
the
garb
of
a
pilgrim
the
frozen
alps
enduring
the
greatest
privations
and
fatigues
and
perils
and
approaching
on
foot
the
gloomy
fortress
of
canossa
beyond
the
po
in
which
hildebrand
had
intrenched
himself
even
then
the
angry
pontiff
refused
to
see
him
henry
had
to
stoop
to
a
still
deeper
degradation
to
stand
bareheaded
and
barefooted
for
three
days
amid
the
blasts
of
winter
in
the
of
the
castle
before
the
pope
would
promise
absolution
and
then
only
at
the
intercession
of
the
countess
matilda
what
are
we
to
think
of
such
a
fall
such
a
humiliation
on
the
part
of
a
sovereign
what
are
we
to
think
of
such
haughtiness
on
the
part
of
a
priest
his
subject
we
are
filled
with
blended
pity
and
indignation
we
are
inclined
to
say
that
this
was
the
greatest
blunder
that
any
monarch
ever
made
that
henry
humbled
and
deserted
and
threatened
as
he
was
should
not
have
stooped
to
this
that
he
should
have
lost
his
crown
and
life
rather
than
handed
over
his
empire
to
a
plebeian
priest
for
he
was
an
acknowledged
hero
he
was
monarch
of
half
of
europe
and
yet
we
are
bound
to
consider
henry
circumstances
and
the
ideas
with
which
he
had
to
contend
his
was
the
error
of
the
middle
ages
the
feeblest
of
his
modern
successors
would
have
killed
the
pope
if
he
could
rather
than
have
disgraced
himself
by
such
an
ignominy
true
it
is
that
henry
came
to
himself
that
he
repented
of
his
step
but
it
was
too
late
gregory
had
gained
the
victory
and
it
was
all
the
greater
because
it
was
a
moral
one
it
was
known
to
all
europe
and
all
the
world
and
would
be
known
to
all
posterity
that
the
emperor
of
germany
had
bowed
in
submission
to
a
foreign
priest
the
temporal
power
had
yielded
to
the
spiritual
the
state
had
conceded
the
supremacy
of
the
church
the
pope
had
triumphed
over
the
mightiest
monarch
of
the
age
and
his
successors
would
place
their
feet
over
future
prostrate
kings
what
a
victory
what
mighty
consequences
were
the
result
of
it
on
what
a
throne
did
this
moral
victory
seat
the
future
pontiffs
of
the
eternal
city
how
august
their
dominion
for
it
was
over
the
minds
and
souls
of
men
truly
to
the
pope
were
given
the
keys
of
heaven
and
hell
and
so
long
as
the
ideas
of
that
age
were
accepted
who
could
resist
a
man
armed
with
the
thunders
of
omnipotence
it
mattered
nothing
that
the
emperor
was
ashamed
of
his
weakness
that
he
retracted
that
he
vowed
vengeance
that
he
marched
at
the
head
of
new
armies
no
matter
that
his
adherents
were
indignant
that
all
germany
wept
that
loyalty
rallied
to
his
aid
that
he
gained
victories
proportionate
with
his
former
defeats
that
he
chased
gregory
from
city
to
city
and
castle
to
castle
and
convent
to
convent
while
his
generals
burned
the
pope
palaces
and
wasted
his
territories
no
matter
that
gregory
broken
defeated
miserable
outwardly
ruined
died
prematurely
in
exile
no
matter
that
he
did
not
in
his
great
reverses
anticipate
the
fruits
of
his
firmness
and
heroism
his
principles
survived
him
they
have
never
been
lost
sight
of
by
his
successors
they
gained
strength
through
successive
generations
innocent
iii
reaped
what
he
had
sown
kings
dared
not
resist
innocent
who
realized
those
three
things
to
which
the
more
able
gregory
had
aspired
independent
sovereignty
control
over
the
princes
of
the
earth
and
the
supremacy
of
the
church
innocent
was
the
greater
pope
but
hildebrand
was
the
greater
man
yet
like
so
many
of
the
great
heroes
of
the
world
he
was
not
destined
in
his
own
person
to
reap
the
fruits
of
his
heroism
i
have
loved
righteousness
and
hated
iniquity
and
therefore
i
die
in
exile
these
were
his
last
bitter
words
he
fancied
he
had
failed
but
did
he
fail
what
did
he
leave
behind
he
left
his
great
example
and
his
still
greater
ideas
he
left
a
legacy
to
his
successors
which
makes
them
still
potent
on
the
earth
in
spite
of
reformations
and
revolutions
and
all
the
triumphs
of
literature
and
science
how
mighty
his
deeds
how
great
his
services
to
his
church
he
found
says
an
eloquent
and
able
edinburgh
reviewer
the
papacy
dependent
on
the
emperor
he
sustained
it
by
alliances
almost
commensurate
with
the
italian
peninsula
he
found
the
papacy
electoral
by
the
roman
people
and
clergy
he
left
it
electoral
by
papal
nomination
he
found
the
emperor
the
virtual
patron
of
the
roman
see
he
wrenched
that
power
from
his
hands
he
found
the
secular
clergy
the
allies
and
dependents
of
the
secular
power
he
converted
them
into
inalienable
auxiliaries
of
his
own
he
found
the
patronage
of
the
church
the
desecrated
spoil
and
merchandise
of
princes
he
reduced
it
to
his
own
dominion
he
is
celebrated
as
the
reformer
of
the
impure
and
profane
abuses
of
his
age
he
is
more
justly
entitled
to
the
praise
of
having
left
the
impress
of
his
gigantic
character
on
all
the
ages
which
have
succeeded
him
such
was
the
great
hildebrand
a
conqueror
however
by
the
force
of
recognized
ideas
more
than
by
his
own
strength
how
long
you
ask
shall
his
empire
last
we
can
not
tell
who
can
predict
the
fortunes
of
such
a
power
it
is
not
for
me
to
speculate
or
preach
in
considering
his
life
and
career
i
have
simply
attempted
to
paint
one
of
the
most
memorable
moral
contests
of
the
world
to
show
the
power
of
genius
and
will
in
a
superstitious
age
and
more
the
majestic
force
of
ideas
over
the
minds

monastic
institutions
one
of
the
oldest
institutions
of
the
church
is
that
which
grew
out
of
monastic
life
it
had
its
seat
at
a
remote
period
in
india
it
has
existed
in
different
forms
in
other
oriental
countries
it
has
been
modified
by
brahminical
buddhistic
and
persian
theogonies
and
extended
to
egypt
syria
and
asia
minor
go
where
you
will
in
the
east
and
you
see
traces
of
its
mighty
influence
we
can
not
tell
its
remotest
origin
but
we
see
everywhere
the
force
of
its
ideas
its
fundamental
principle
appears
to
be
the
desire
to
propitiate
the
deity
by
penances
and
ascetic
labors
as
an
atonement
for
sin
or
as
a
means
of
rising
to
a
higher
religious
life
it
has
sought
to
escape
the
polluting
influences
of
demoralized
society
by
lofty
contemplation
and
retirement
from
the
world
from
the
first
it
was
a
protest
against
materialism
luxury
and
enervating
pleasures
it
recognized
something
higher
and
nobler
than
devotion
to
material
gains
or
a
life
of
degrading
pleasure
in
one
sense
it
was
an
intellectual
movement
while
in
another
it
was
an
insult
to
the
human
understanding
it
attempted
a
purer
morality
but
abnegated
obvious
and
pressing
duties
it
was
always
a
contradiction
lofty
while
degraded
seeking
to
comprehend
the
profoundest
mysteries
yet
debased
by
puerile
superstitions
the
consciousness
of
mankind
in
all
ages
and
countries
has
ever
accepted
retribution
for
sin
more
or
less
permanent
in
this
world
or
in
the
next
and
it
has
equally
accepted
the
existence
of
a
supreme
intelligence
and
power
to
whom
all
are
responsible
and
in
connection
with
whom
human
destinies
are
bound
up
the
deeper
we
penetrate
into
the
occult
wisdom
of
the
east
on
which
light
has
been
shed
by
modern
explorations
monumental
inscriptions
manuscripts
historical
records
and
other
things
which
science
and
genius
have
deciphered
the
surer
we
feel
that
the
esoteric
classes
of
india
egypt
and
china
were
more
united
in
their
views
of
supreme
power
and
intelligence
than
was
generally
supposed
fifty
years
ago
the
higher
intellects
of
asia
in
all
countries
and
ages
had
more
lofty
ideas
of
god
than
we
have
a
right
to
infer
from
the
superstitions
of
the
people
generally
they
had
unenlightened
ideas
as
to
the
grounds
of
forgiveness
but
of
the
necessity
of
forgiveness
and
the
favor
of
the
deity
they
had
no
doubt
the
philosophical
opinions
of
these
sages
gave
direction
to
a
great
religious
movement
matter
was
supposed
to
be
inherently
evil
and
mind
was
thought
to
be
inherently
good
the
seat
of
evil
was
placed
in
the
body
rather
than
in
the
heart
and
mind
not
the
thoughts
of
men
were
evil
but
the
passions
and
appetites
of
the
body
hence
the
first
thing
for
a
good
man
to
do
was
to
bring
the
body
this
seat
of
evil
under
subjection
and
if
possible
to
eradicate
the
passions
and
appetites
which
enslave
the
body
and
this
was
to
be
done
by
penances
austerities
and
solitude
flight
from
the
contaminating
influences
of
the
world
all
oriental
piety
assumed
this
ascetic
form
the
transition
was
easy
to
the
sundering
of
domestic
ties
to
the
suppression
of
natural
emotions
and
social
enjoyments
the
devotee
became
austere
cold
inhuman
unsocial
he
shunned
the
habitations
of
men
and
the
more
desirous
he
was
to
essay
a
high
religious
life
and
thus
rise
in
favor
with
god
the
more
severe
and
revengeful
and
unforgiving
he
made
the
deity
he
adored
not
a
compassionate
creator
and
father
but
an
irresistible
power
bent
on
his
destruction
this
degrading
view
of
the
deity
borrowed
from
paganism
tinged
the
subsequent
theology
of
the
christian
monks
and
entered
largely
into
the
theology
of
the
middle
ages
such
was
the
prevailing
philosophy
or
theosophy
both
lofty
and
degraded
with
which
the
christian
convert
had
to
contend
not
merely
the
shameless
vices
of
the
people
so
open
and
flagrant
as
to
call
out
disgust
and
indignation
but
also
the
views
which
the
more
virtuous
and
religious
of
pagan
saints
accepted
and
promulgated
and
not
saints
alone
but
those
who
made
the
greatest
pretension
to
intellectual
culture
like
the
gnostics
and
manicheans
those
men
who
were
the
first
to
ensnare
saint
augustine
specious
subtle
sophistical
as
acute
as
the
brahmins
of
india
it
was
eastern
philosophy
false
as
we
regard
it
which
created
the
most
powerful
institution
that
existed
in
europe
for
above
a
thousand
years
an
institution
which
all
the
learning
and
eloquence
of
the
reformers
of
the
sixteenth
century
could
not
subvert
except
in
protestant
countries
now
what
more
specifically
were
the
ideas
which
the
early
monks
borrowed
from
india
persia
and
egypt
which
ultimately
took
such
a
firm
hold
of
the
european
mind
one
was
the
superior
virtue
of
a
life
devoted
to
purely
religious
contemplation
and
for
the
same
end
that
animated
the
existence
of
fakirs
and
sofis
it
was
to
escape
the
contaminating
influence
of
matter
to
rise
above
the
wants
of
the
body
to
exterminate
animal
passions
and
appetites
to
hide
from
a
world
which
luxury
corrupted
the
christian
recluses
were
thus
led
to
bury
themselves
in
cells
among
the
mountains
and
deserts
in
dreary
and
uncomfortable
caverns
in
isolated
retreats
far
from
the
habitation
of
men
yea
among
wild
beasts
clothing
themselves
in
their
skins
and
eating
their
food
in
order
to
commune
with
god
more
effectually
and
propitiate
his
favor
their
thoughts
were
diverted
from
the
miseries
which
they
ought
to
have
alleviated
and
the
ignorance
which
they
ought
to
have
removed
and
were
concentrated
upon
themselves
not
upon
their
relatives
and
neighbors
the
cries
of
suffering
humanity
were
disregarded
in
a
vain
attempt
to
practise
doubtful
virtues
how
much
good
those
pious
recluses
might
have
done
had
their
piety
taken
a
more
practical
form
what
missionaries
they
might
have
made
what
laborers
in
the
field
of
active
philanthropy
what
noble
teachers
to
the
poor
and
miserable
the
conversion
of
the
world
to
christianity
did
not
enter
into
their
minds
so
much
as
the
desire
to
swell
the
number
of
their
communities
they
only
aimed
at
a
dreamy
pietism
at
best
their
own
individual
salvation
rather
than
the
salvation
of
others
instead
of
reaching
to
the
beatific
vision
they
became
ignorant
narrow
and
visionary
and
when
learned
they
fought
for
words
and
not
for
things
they
were
advocates
of
subtile
and
metaphysical
distinctions
in
theology
rather
than
of
those
practical
duties
and
simple
faith
which
primitive
christianity
enjoined
monastic
life
no
less
than
the
schools
of
alexandria
was
influential
in
creating
a
divinity
which
gave
as
great
authority
to
dogmas
that
are
the
result
of
intellectual
deductions
as
those
based
on
direct
and
original
declarations
and
these
deductions
were
often
gloomy
and
colored
by
the
fears
which
were
inseparable
from
a
belief
in
divine
wrath
rather
than
divine
love
the
genius
of
monasticism
ancient
and
modern
is
the
propitiation
of
the
divinity
who
seeks
to
punish
rather
than
to
forgive
it
invented
purgatory
to
escape
the
awful
burnings
of
an
everlasting
hell
of
physical
sufferings
it
pervaded
the
whole
theology
of
the
middle
ages
filling
hamlet
and
convent
alike
with
an
atmosphere
of
fear
and
wrath
and
creating
a
cruel
spiritual
despotism
the
recluse
isolated
and
lonely
consumed
himself
with
phantoms
fancied
devils
and
chimeras
dire
he
could
not
escape
from
himself
although
he
might
fly
from
society
as
a
means
of
grace
he
sought
voluntary
solitary
confinement
without
nutritious
food
or
proper
protection
from
the
heat
and
cold
clad
in
a
sheepskin
filled
with
dirt
and
vermin
what
life
could
be
more
antagonistic
to
enlightened
reason
what
mistake
more
fatal
to
everything
like
culture
knowledge
happiness
and
all
for
what
to
strive
after
an
impossible
perfection
or
the
solution
of
insoluble
questions
or
the
favor
of
a
deity
whose
attributes
he
misunderstood
but
this
unnatural
unwise
retirement
was
not
the
worst
evil
in
the
life
of
a
primitive
monk
with
all
its
dreamy
contemplation
and
silent
despair
it
was
accompanied
with
the
most
painful
austerities
scourgings
lacerations
dire
privations
to
propitiate
an
angry
deity
or
to
bring
the
body
into
a
state
which
would
be
insensible
to
pain
or
to
exorcise
passions
which
the
imaginations
inflamed
all
this
was
based
on
penance
which
entered
so
largely
into
the
theogonies
of
the
east
and
which
gave
a
gloomy
form
to
the
piety
of
the
middle
ages
this
error
was
among
the
first
to
kindle
the
fiery
protests
of
luther
the
repudiation
of
this
error
and
of
its
logical
sequences
was
one
of
the
causes
of
the
reformation
this
error
cast
its
dismal
shadow
on
the
common
life
of
the
middle
ages
you
can
not
penetrate
the
spirit
of
those
centuries
without
a
painful
recognition
of
almost
universal
darkness
and
despair
how
gloomy
was
a
gothic
church
before
the
eleventh
century
with
its
dark
and
heavy
crypt
its
narrow
windows
its
massive
pillars
its
low
roof
its
cold
damp
pavement
as
if
men
went
into
that
church
to
hide
themselves
and
sing
mournful
songs
the
of
monastic
fear
but
the
primitive
monks
with
all
their
lofty
and
efforts
for
holy
meditation
towards
the
middle
of
the
fourth
century
as
their
number
increased
from
the
anarchies
and
miseries
of
a
falling
empire
became
quarrelsome
sometimes
turbulent
and
generally
fierce
and
fanatical
they
had
to
be
governed
they
needed
some
master
mind
to
control
them
and
confine
them
to
their
religious
duties
then
arose
basil
a
great
scholar
and
accustomed
to
civilized
life
in
the
schools
of
athens
and
constantinople
who
gave
rules
and
laws
to
the
monks
gathered
them
into
communities
and
discouraged
social
isolation
knowing
that
the
demons
had
more
power
over
men
when
they
were
alone
and
idle
this
basil
was
an
extraordinary
man
his
ancestors
were
honorable
and
wealthy
he
moved
in
the
highest
circle
of
social
life
like
chrysostom
he
was
educated
in
the
most
famous
schools
he
travelled
extensively
like
other
young
men
of
rank
his
tutor
was
the
celebrated
libanius
the
greatest
rhetorician
of
the
day
he
exhausted
antioch
caesarea
and
constantinople
and
completed
his
studies
at
athens
where
he
formed
a
famous
friendship
with
gregory
nazianzen
which
was
as
warm
and
devoted
as
that
between
cicero
and
atticus
these
young
men
were
the
talk
and
admiration
of
athens
here
too
he
was
intimate
with
young
julian
afterwards
the
apostate
emperor
of
rome
basil
then
visited
the
schools
of
alexandria
and
made
the
acquaintance
of
the
great
athanasius
as
well
as
of
those
monks
who
sought
a
retreat
amid
egyptian
solitudes
here
his
conversion
took
place
and
he
parted
with
his
princely
patrimony
for
the
benefit
of
the
poor
he
then
entered
the
church
and
was
successively
ordained
deacon
and
priest
while
leading
a
monastic
life
he
retired
among
the
mountains
of
armenia
and
made
choice
of
a
beautiful
grove
watered
with
crystal
streams
where
he
gave
himself
to
study
and
meditation
here
he
was
joined
by
his
friend
gregory
nazianzen
and
by
enthusiastic
admirers
who
formed
a
religious
fraternity
to
whom
he
was
a
spiritual
father
he
afterwards
was
forced
to
accept
the
great
see
of
caesarea
and
was
no
less
renowned
as
bishop
and
orator
than
he
had
been
as
monk
yet
it
is
as
a
monk
that
he
left
the
most
enduring
influence
since
he
made
the
first
great
change
in
monastic
life
making
it
more
orderly
more
industrious
and
less
fanatical
he
instituted
or
embodied
among
others
the
three
great
vows
which
are
vital
to
monastic
institutions
poverty
obedience
and
chastity
in
these
vows
he
gave
the
institution
a
more
christian
and
a
less
oriental
aspect
monachism
became
more
practical
and
less
visionary
and
wild
it
approximated
nearer
to
the
christian
standard
submission
to
poverty
is
certainly
a
christian
virtue
if
voluntary
poverty
is
not
chastity
is
a
cardinal
duty
obedience
is
a
necessity
to
all
civilized
life
it
is
the
first
condition
of
all
government
moreover
these
three
vows
seem
to
have
been
called
for
by
the
condition
of
society
and
the
prevalence
of
destructive
views
here
basil
one
of
the
commanding
intellects
of
his
day
and
as
learned
and
polished
as
he
was
pious
like
jerome
after
him
proved
himself
a
great
legislator
and
administrator
including
in
his
comprehensive
view
both
christian
principles
and
the
necessities
of
the
times
and
adapting
his
institution
to
both
one
of
the
most
obvious
flagrant
and
universal
evils
of
the
day
was
devotion
to
in
order
to
purchase
sensual
pleasures
it
pervaded
roman
life
from
the
time
of
augustus
the
vow
of
poverty
therefore
was
a
stern
lofty
disdainful
protest
against
the
most
dangerous
and
demoralizing
evil
of
the
empire
it
hurled
scorn
hatred
and
defiance
on
this
overwhelming
evil
and
invoked
the
aid
of
christianity
it
was
simply
the
earnest
affirmation
and
belief
that
money
could
not
buy
the
higher
joys
of
earth
and
might
jeopardize
the
hopes
of
heaven
it
called
to
mind
the
greatest
examples
it
showed
that
the
great
teachers
of
mankind
the
sages
and
prophets
of
history
had
disdained
money
as
the
highest
good
that
riches
exposed
men
to
great
temptation
and
lowered
the
standard
of
morality
and
virtue
how
hardly
shall
they
who
have
riches
enter
into
the
kingdom
of
god
it
appealed
to
the
highest
form
of
it
arrayed
itself
against
a
vice
which
was
undermining
society
and
among
truly
christian
people
this
new
application
of
christ
warnings
against
the
dangers
of
wealth
excited
enthusiasm
it
was
like
enlisting
in
the
army
of
christ
against
his
greatest
enemies
make
any
duty
clear
and
imperious
to
christian
people
and
they
will
generally
conform
to
it
so
the
world
saw
one
of
the
most
impressive
spectacles
of
all
history
the
rich
giving
up
their
possessions
to
follow
the
example
and
injunctions
of
christ
it
was
the
most
signal
test
of
christian
obedience
it
prompted
paula
the
richest
lady
of
christian
antiquity
to
devote
the
revenues
of
an
entire
city
which
she
owned
to
the
cause
of
christ
and
the
approbation
of
jerome
her
friend
was
a
sufficient
recompense
the
vow
of
chastity
was
equally
a
protest
against
one
of
the
characteristic
vices
of
the
day
as
well
as
a
christian
virtue
luxury
and
lives
had
relaxed
the
restraints
of
home
and
the
virtues
of
earlier
days
the
evils
of
concubinage
were
shameless
and
open
throughout
the
empire
which
led
to
a
low
estimate
of
female
virtue
and
degraded
the
sex
the
pagan
poets
held
up
woman
as
a
subject
of
scorn
and
scarcasm
on
no
subject
were
the
apostles
more
urgent
in
their
exhortations
than
to
a
life
of
purity
to
no
greater
temptation
were
the
converts
to
christianity
subjected
than
the
looseness
of
prevailing
sentiments
in
reference
to
this
vice
it
stared
everybody
in
the
face
basil
took
especial
care
to
guard
the
monks
from
this
prevailing
iniquity
and
made
chastity
a
transcendent
and
fundamental
virtue
he
aimed
to
remove
the
temptation
to
sin
the
monks
were
enjoined
to
shun
the
very
presence
of
women
if
they
carried
the
system
of
too
far
and
became
hard
and
unsympathetic
it
was
to
avoid
the
great
scandal
of
the
age
a
still
greater
evil
to
the
monk
was
denied
even
the
blessing
of
the
marriage
ties
celibacy
became
a
fundamental
law
of
monachism
it
was
not
to
cement
a
spiritual
despotism
that
basil
forbade
marriage
but
to
attain
a
greater
sanctity
for
a
monk
was
consecrated
to
what
was
supposed
to
be
the
higher
life
this
law
of
celibacy
was
abused
and
gradually
was
extended
to
all
the
clergy
secular
as
well
as
regular
but
not
till
the
clergy
were
all
subordinated
to
the
rule
of
an
absolute
pope
it
is
the
fate
of
all
human
institutions
to
become
corrupt
but
no
institution
of
the
church
has
been
so
fatally
perverted
as
that
pertaining
to
the
marriage
of
the
clergy
founded
to
promote
purity
of
personal
life
it
was
used
to
uphold
the
arms
of
spiritual
despotism
it
was
the
policy
of
hildebrand
the
vow
of
obedience
again
was
made
in
special
reference
to
the
disintegration
of
society
when
laws
were
feebly
enforced
and
a
central
power
was
passing
away
the
discipline
even
of
armies
was
relaxed
mobs
were
the
order
of
the
day
even
in
imperial
cities
moreover
monks
had
long
been
insubordinate
they
obeyed
no
head
except
nominally
they
were
with
difficulty
ruled
in
their
communities
therefore
obedience
was
made
a
cardinal
virtue
as
essential
to
the
very
existence
of
monastic
institutions
i
need
not
here
allude
to
the
perversion
of
this
rule
how
it
degenerated
into
a
fearful
despotism
and
was
made
use
of
by
ambitious
popes
and
finally
by
the
generals
of
the
mendicant
friars
and
the
jesuits
all
the
rules
of
basil
were
perverted
from
their
original
intention
but
in
his
day
they
were
called
for
about
a
century
later
the
monastic
system
went
through
another
change
or
development
when
benedict
a
remarkable
organizer
instituted
on
monte
cassino
near
naples
his
celebrated
monastery
which
became
the
model
of
all
the
monasteries
of
the
west
he
reaffirmed
the
rules
of
basil
but
with
greater
strictness
he
gave
no
new
principles
to
monastic
life
but
he
adapted
it
to
the
climate
and
institutions
of
the
newly
founded
gothic
kingdoms
of
europe
it
became
less
oriental
it
was
made
more
practical
it
was
invested
with
new
dignity
the
most
visionary
and
fanatical
of
all
the
institutions
of
the
east
was
made
useful
the
monks
became
industrious
industry
was
recognized
as
a
prime
necessity
even
for
men
who
had
retired
from
the
world
no
longer
were
the
labors
of
monks
confined
to
the
weaving
of
baskets
but
they
were
extended
to
the
comforts
of
ordinary
life
to
the
erection
of
stately
buildings
to
useful
arts
the
systematic
cultivation
of
the
land
to
the
accumulation
of
wealth
not
for
individuals
but
for
their
monasteries
monastic
life
became
less
dreamy
less
visionary
but
more
useful
recognizing
the
bodily
necessities
of
men
the
religious
duties
of
monks
were
still
dreary
monotonous
and
gloomy
long
and
protracted
singing
in
the
choir
incessant
vigils
an
unnatural
silence
at
the
table
solitary
walks
in
the
cloister
the
absence
of
social
pleasures
confinement
to
the
precincts
of
their
convents
but
their
convents
became
of
industry
and
their
lands
were
highly
cultivated
the
monks
were
hospitable
they
entertained
strangers
and
gave
a
shelter
to
the
persecuted
and
miserable
their
monasteries
became
sacred
retreats
which
were
respected
by
those
rude
warriors
who
crushed
beneath
their
feet
the
glories
of
ancient
civilization
nor
for
several
centuries
did
the
monks
in
their
sacred
enclosures
give
especial
scandal
their
lives
were
spent
in
labors
of
a
useful
kind
alternated
and
relieved
by
devotional
duties
hence
they
secured
the
respect
and
favor
of
princes
and
good
men
who
gave
them
lands
and
rich
presents
of
gold
and
silver
vessels
their
convents
were
unmolested
and
richly
endowed
and
these
became
enormously
multiplied
in
every
european
country
gradually
they
became
so
rich
as
to
absorb
the
wealth

the

it

the

have

and
have
been
elevated
to
the
papal
throne
from
these
things
and
others
which
may
seem
too
trivial
to
mention
we
infer
the
great
wealth
and
power
of
monastic
institutions
the
most
flourishing
days
of
which
were
from
the
sixth
century
to
the
crusades
beginning
in
the
eleventh
when
more
than
one
hundred
thousand
monks
acknowledged
the
rule
of
saint
benedict
during
this
period
of
prosperity
when
the
vast
abbey
churches
were
built
and
when
abbots
were
great
temporal
as
well
as
spiritual
magnates
quite
on
an
equality
with
the
proudest
feudal
barons
we
notice
a
marked
decline
in
the
virtues
which
had
extorted
the
admiration
of
europe
the
benedictines
retained
their
original
organization
they
were
bound
by
the
same
vows
as
individuals
the
monks
were
always
poor
they
wore
the
same
dress
as
they
did
centuries
before
and
they
did
not
fail
in
their
duties
in
the
choir
singing
their
mournful
chants
from
two
in
the
morning
but
discipline
was
relaxed
the
brothers
strayed
into
unseemly
places
they
indulged
in
the
pleasures
of
the
table
they
were
sensual
in
their
appearance
they
were
certainly
ignorant
as
a
body
and
they
performed
more
singing
than
preaching
or
teaching
they
lived
for
themselves
rather
than
for
the
people
they
however
remained
hospitable
to
the
last
their
convents
were
hotels
as
well
as
any
stranger
could
remain
two
nights
at
a
convent
without
compensation
and
without
being
questioned
the
brothers
dined
together
at
the
refectory
according
to
the
rules
on
bread
vegetables
and
a
little
meat
although
it
was
noticed
that
they
had
a
great
variety
in
cooking
eggs
which
were
turned
and
roasted
and
beaten
up
and
hardened
and
minced
and
fried
and
stuffed
it
is
said
that
subsequently
they
drank
enormous
quantities
of
beer
and
wine
and
sometimes
even
to
disgraceful
excess
their
rules
required
them
to
keep
silence
at
their
meals
but
their
humanity
got
the
better
of
them
and
they
have
been
censured
for
their
hilarious
and
frivolous
conversation
for
jests
and
stories
and
puns
bernard
accused
the
monks
of
degeneracy
of
being
given
to
the
pleasures
of
the
table
of
loving
the
good
things
which
they
professed
to
scorn
rare
fish
game
and
elaborate
cookery
that
the
monks
sadly
degenerated
in
morals
and
discipline
and
even
became
objects
of
scandal
is
questioned
by
no
respectable
historian
no
one
was
more
bitter
and
vehement
in
his
denunciations
of
this
almost
universal
corruption
of
monastic
life
than
saint
bernard
himself
the
impersonation
of
an
ideal
monk
hence
reforms
were
attempted
and
the
cluniacs
and
cistercians
and
other
orders
arose
modelled
after
the
original
institution
on
monte
cassino
these
were
only
branches
of
the
benedictines
their
vows
and
habits
and
duties
were
the
same
it
would
seem
that
the
prevailing
vices
of
the
benedictines
in
their
decline
were
those
which
were
fostered
by
great
wealth
and
consequent
idleness
and
luxury
but
at
their
worst
estate
the
monks
or
regular
clergy
were
no
worse
than
the
secular
clergy
or
parish
priests
in
their
ordinary
lives
and
were
more
intelligent
at
least
more
learned
the
ignorance
of
the
secular
clergy
was
notorious
and
scandalous
they
could
not
even
write
letters
of
common
salutation
and
what
little
knowledge
they
had
was
extolled
and
exaggerated
it
was
confined
to
the
acquisition
of
the
psalter
by
heart
while
a
little
grammar
writing
and
accounts
were
regarded
as
extraordinary
he
who
could
write
a
few
homilies
drawn
from
the
fathers
was
a
wonder
and
a
prodigy
there
was
a
total
absence
of
classical
literature
but
the
monks
ignorant
and
degenerate
as
they
were
guarded
what
little
literature
had
escaped
the
ruin
of
the
ancient
civilization
they
gave
the
only
education
the
age
afforded
there
was
usually
a
school
attached
to
every
convent
and
manual
labor
was
shortened
in
favor
of
students
nor
did
the
monks
systematically
and
deliberately
shut
the
door
of
knowledge
against
those
inclined
to
study
for
at
that
time
there
was
no
jealousy
of
learning
there
was
only
indifference
to
it
or
want
of
appreciation
the
age
was
ignorant
and
life
was
hard
and
the
struggle
for
existence
occupied
the
thoughts
of
all
the
time
of
the
monks
was
consumed
in
alternate
drudgeries
and
monotonous
devotions
there
was
such
a
general
intellectual
torpor
that
scholars
and
these
were
very
few
were
left
at
liberty
to
think
and
write
as
they
pleased
on
the
great
questions
of
theology
there
was
such
a
general
unanimity
of
belief
that
the
popes
were
not
on
the
for
heresy
nobody
thought
of
attacking
their
throne
there
was
no
jealousy
about
the
reading
of
the
scriptures
every
convent
had
a
small
library
mostly
composed
of
lives
of
the
saints
and
of
devout
meditations
and
homilies
and
the
bible
was
the
greatest
treasure
of
all
the
vulgate
of
saint
jerome
which
was
copied
and
illuminated
by
busy
hands
in
spite
of
the
general
ignorance
the
monks
relieved
their
dull
lives
by
some
attempts
at
art
this
was
the
age
of
the
most
beautiful
illuminated
manuscripts
there
was
but
little
of
doctrinal
controversy
for
the
creed
of
the
church
was
settled
but
pious
meditations
and
the
writings
of
noted
saints
were
studied
and
accepted
especially
the
works
of
saint
augustine
who
had
fixed
the
thinking
of
the
west
for
a
thousand
years
pagan
literature
had
but
little
charm
until
aristotle
was
translated
by
arabian
scholars
the
literature
of
the
church
was
puerile
and
extravagant
yet
christian
consisting
chiefly
of
legends
of
martyrs
and
lives
of
saints
that
literature
has
no
charm
to
us
and
can
never
be
revived
indeed
is
already
forgotten
and
neglected
as
well
it
may
be
but
it
gave
unity
to
christian
belief
and
enthroned
the
christian
heroes
on
the
highest
pedestal
of
human
greatness
in
the
monasteries
some
one
of
the
fraternity
read
aloud
these
lives
and
meditations
while
the
brothers
worked
or
dined
there
was
no
discussion
for
all
thought
alike
and
all
sought
to
stimulate
religious
emotions
rather
than
to
quicken
intellectual
activity
about
half
the
time
of
the
monks
in
a
monastery
was
given
to
singing
and
devotional
exercises
and
religious
improvement
and
the
other
half
to
labors
in
the
fields
or
in
painting
or
musical
composition
so
far
as
we
know
the
monks
lived
in
great
harmony
and
were
obedient
to
the
commands
of
their
superiors
they
had
a
common
object
to
live
for
and
had
few
differences
in
opinion
on
any
subject
they
did
not
enjoy
a
high
life
but
it
was
free
from
distracting
pleasures
they
affected
great
humility
with
which
spiritual
pride
was
mingled
not
the
arrogant
pride
of
the
dialectician
but
the
pride
of
the
devotee
there
was
no
religious
hatred
except
towards
turks
and
saracens
the
monk
in
his
narrowness
and
ignorance
may
be
repulsive
to
an
enlightened
age
he
was
not
repulsive
to
his
own
for
he
was
not
behind
it
either
in
his
ideas
or
in
his
habits
of
life
in
fact
the
more
repulsive
the
monk
of
the
dark
ages
is
to
this
generation
the
more
venerated
he
was
by
bishops
and
barons
seven
hundred
years
ago
which
fact
leads
us
to
infer
that
the
degenerate
monk
might
be
to
us
most
interesting
when
he
was
most
condemned
by
the
reformers
of
his
day
since
he
was
more
humane
genial
and
free
than
his
brethren
chained
to
the
rigid
discipline
of
his
convent
even
a
friar
tuck
is
not
so
repulsive
to
us
as
an
unsocial
austere
and
ignorant
fanatic
of
the
eleventh
century
but
the
monks
were
not
to
remain
forever
imprisoned
in
the
castles
of
ignorance
and
despair
with
the
opening
of
the
twelfth
century
light
began
to
dawn
upon
the
human
mind
the
intellectual
monk
long
accustomed
to
devout
meditations
began
to
speculate
on
those
subjects
which
had
occupied
his
thoughts
on
god
and
his
attributes
on
the
nature
and
penalty
of
sin
on
redemption
on
the
saviour
on
the
power
of
the
will
to
resist
evil
and
other
questions
that
had
agitated
the
early
fathers
of
the
church
then
arose
such
men
as
erigena
roscelin
b√©renger
lanfranc
anselm
bernard
and
others
all
more
or
less
orthodox
but
inquiring
and
intellectual
it
was
within
the
walls
of
the
cloister
that
the
awakening
began
and
the
first
impulse
was
given
to
learning
and
philosophy
the
abbey
of
bec
in
normandy
was
the
most
distinguished
of
new
intellectual
centres
while
clairvaux
and
other
princely
abbeys
had
inmates
as
distinguished
for
meditative
habits
as
for
luxury
and
pride
it
was
at
this
period
when
the
convents
of
europe
rejoiced
in
ample
possessions
and
their
churches
rivalled
cathedrals
in
size
and
magnificence
and
their
abbots
were
lords
and
princes
the
palmy
age
of
monastic
institutions
chiefly
of
the
benedictine
order
that
saint
bernard
the
greatest
and
best
representative
of
mediaeval
monasticism
was
born
at
fontaine
in
burgundy
he
belonged
to
a
noble
family
his
mother
was
as
remarkable
as
monica
or
nonna
she
had
six
sons
and
a
daughter
whom
she
early
consecrated
to
the
lord
bernard
was
the
third
son
like
luther
he
was
religiously
inclined
from
early
youth
and
panted
for
monastic
seclusion
at
the
age
of
he
entered
the
new
monastery
at
citeaux
which
had
been
founded
a
few
years
before
by
stephen
harding
an
english
saint
who
revived
the
rule
of
saint
benedict
with
still
greater
strictness
and
was
the
founder
of
the
cistercian
order
a
branch
of
the
benedictines
he
entered
this
gloomy
retreat
situated
amid
marshes
and
morasses
with
no
outward
attractions
like
cluny
but
unhealthy
and
miserably
poor
the
dreariest
spot
perhaps
in
burgundy
and
he
entered
at
the
head
of
thirty
young
men
of
the
noble
class
among
whom
were
four
of
his
brothers
who
had
been
knights
and
who
presented
themselves
to
the
abbot
as
novices
bent
on
the
severest
austerities
that
human
nature
could
support
bernard
himself
was
a
beautiful
delicate
refined
young
man
tall
with
flaxen
hair
fair
complexion
blue
eyes
from
which
shone
a
superhuman
simplicity
and
purity
his
noble
birth
would
have
opened
to
him
the
highest
dignities
of
the
church
but
he
sought
only
to
bear
the
yoke
of
christ
and
to
be
nailed
to
the
cross
and
he
really
became
a
common
laborer
wrapped
in
a
coarse
cowl
digging
ditches
and
planting
fields
for
such
were
the
labors
of
the
monks
of
citeaux
when
not
performing
their
religious
exercises
but
his
disposition
was
as
beautiful
as
his
person
and
he
soon
won
the
admiration
of
his
brother
monks
as
he
had
won
the
affection
of
the
knights
of
burgundy
such
was
his
physical
weakness
that
nearly
everything
he
took
his
stomach
rejected
and
such
was
the
rigor
of
his
austerities
that
he
destroyed
the
power
of
appetite
he
could
scarcely
distinguish
oil
from
wine
he
satisfied
his
hunger
with
the
bible
and
quenched
his
thirst
with
prayer
in
three
years
he
became
famous
as
a
saint
and
was
made
abbot
of
clairvaux
a
new
cistercian
convent
in
a
retired
valley
which
had
been
a
nest
of
robbers
but
his
intellect
was
as
remarkable
as
his
piety
and
his
monastery
became
not
only
a
model
of
monastic
life
to
which
flocked
men
from
all
parts
of
europe
to
study
its
rules
but
the
ascetic
abbot
himself
became
an
oracle
on
all
the
questions
of
the
day
so
great
was
his
influence
that
when
he
died
in
he
left
behind
one
hundred
and
sixty
monasteries
formed
after
his
model
he
became
the
counsellor
of
kings
and
nobles
bishops
and
popes
he
was
summoned
to
attend
councils
and
settle
quarrels
his
correspondence
exceeded
that
of
jerome
or
saint
augustine
he
was
sought
for
as
bishop
in
the
largest
cities
of
france
and
italy
he
ruled
europe
by
the
power
of
learning
and
sanctity
he
entered
into
all
the
theological
controversies
of
the
day
he
was
the
opponent
of
ab√©lard
whose
condemnation
he
secured
he
became
a
great
theologian
and
statesman
as
well
as
churchman
he
incited
the
princes
of
europe
to
a
new
crusade
his
eloquence
is
said
to
have
been
marvellous
even
the
tones
of
his
voice
would
melt
to
pity
or
excite
to
rage
with
a
long
neck
like
that
of
cicero
and
a
trembling
emaciated
frame
he
preached
with
passionate
intensity
nobody
could
resist
his
eloquence
he
could
scarcely
stand
upright
from
weakness
yet
he
could
address
ten
thousand
men
he
was
an
outspoken
man
and
reproved
the
greatest
dignitaries
with
as
much
boldness
as
did
savonarola
he
denounced
the
gluttony
of
monks
the
avarice
of
popes
and
the
rapacity
of
princes
he
held
heresy
in
mortal
hatred
like
the
fathers
of
the
fifth
century
his
hostility
to
ab√©lard
was
direful
since
he
looked
upon
him
as
undermining
christianity
and
extinguishing
faith
in
the
world
in
his
defence
of
orthodoxy
he
was
the
peer
of
augustine
or
athanasius
he
absolutely
abhorred
the
mohammedans
as
the
bitterest
foes
of
christendom
the
persecutors
of
pious
pilgrims
he
wandered
over
europe
preaching
a
crusade
he
renounced
the
world
yet
was
compelled
by
the
unanimous
voice
of
his
contemporaries
to
govern
the
world
he
gave
a
new
impulse
to
the
order
of
knights
templars
he
was
as
warlike
as
he
was
humble
he
would
breathe
the
breath
of
intense
hostility
into
the
souls
of
crusaders
and
then
hasten
back
to
the
desolate
and
barren
country
in
which
clairvaux
was
situated
rebuild
his
hut
of
leaves
and
boughs
and
soothe
his
restless
spirit
with
the
study
of
the
song
of
songs
like
his
age
and
like
his
institution
he
was
a
great
contradiction
the
fiercest
and
most
dogmatic
of
controversialists
was
the
most
gentle
and
loving
of
saints
his
humanity
was
as
marked
as
his
fanaticism
and
nothing
could
weaken
it
not
even
the
rigors
of
his
convent
life
he
wept
at
the
sorrows
of
all
who
sought
his
sympathy
or
advice
on
the
occasion
of
his
brother
death
he
endeavored
to
preach
a
sermon
on
the
canticles
but
broke
down
as
jerome
did
at
the
funeral
of
paula
he
kept
to
the
last
the
most
vivid
recollection
of
his
mother
and
every
night
before
he
went
to
bed
he
recited
the
seven
penitential
psalms
for
the
benefit
of
her
soul
in
his
sermons
and
exhortations
bernard
dwelt
equally
on
the
wrath
of
god
and
the
love
of
christ
said
he
to
a
runaway
cistercian
thou
fearest
watchings
fasts
and
manual
labor
but
these
are
light
to
one
who
thinks
on
eternal
fire
the
remembrance
of
the
outer
darkness
takes
away
all
horror
from
solitude
place
before
thine
eyes
the
everlasting
weeping
and
gnashing
of
teeth
the
fury
of
those
flames
which
can
never
be
extinguished
the
essence
of
the
theology
of
the
middle
ages
the
fear
of
hell
of
a
physical
and
eternal
hell
of
bodily
torments
by
which
fear
those
ages
were
controlled
bernard
the
loveliest
impersonation
of
virtue
which
those
ages
saw
was
not
beyond
their
ideas
he
impersonated
them
and
therefore
led
the
age
and
became
its
greatest
oracle
the
passive
virtues
of
the
sermon
on
the
mount
were
united
with
the
fiercest
passions
of
religious
intolerance
and
the
most
repulsive
views
of
divine
vengeance
that
is
the
soul
of
monasticism
even
as
reformed
by
harding
alberic
and
bernard
in
the
twelfth
century
less
human
than
in
the
tenth
century
yet
more
intellectual
the
monks
of
citeaux
of
morimond
of
pontigny
of
clairvaux
amid
the
wastes
of
a
barren
country
with
their
white
habits
and
perpetual
vigils
and
haircloth
shirts
and
root
dinners
and
hard
labors
in
the
field
were
yet
the
counsellors
and
ministers
of
kings
and
the
creators
of
popes
and
incited
the
nations
to
the
most
bloody
and
unfortunate
wars
in
the
whole
history
of
society
i
mean
the
crusades
some
were
great
intellectual
giants
yet
all
repelled
scepticism
as
life
repels
death
all
dwelt
on
the
sufferings
of
the
cross
as
a
door
through
which
the
penitent
and
believing
could
surely
enter
heaven
yet
based
the
justice
of
the
infinite
father
of
love
on
what
when
it
appeals
to
consciousness
seems
to
be
the
direst
injustice
we
can
not
despise
the
middle
ages
which
produced
such
beatific
and
exalted
saints
but
we
pity
those
dismal
times
when
the
great
mass
of
the
people
had
so
little
pleasure
and
comfort
in
this
life
and
such
gloomy
fears
of
the
world
to
come
when
life
was
made
a
perpetual
sacrifice
and
abnegation
of
all
the
pleasures
that
are
given
us
to
enjoy
to
use
and
not
to
pervert
hence
monasticism
was
repulsive
even
in
its
best
ages
to
enlightened
reason
and
fatal
to
all
progress
among
nations
although
it
served
a
useful
purpose
when
men
were
governed
by
fear
alone
and
when
violence
and
strife
and
physical
discomfort
and
ignorance
and
degrading
superstitions
covered
the
fairest
portion
of
the
earth
with
a
funereal
pall
for
more
than
a
thousand
years
the
thirteenth
century
saw
a
new
development
of
monastic
institutions
in
the
creation
of
the
mendicant
friars
especially
the
dominicans
and
franciscans
monks
whose
mission
it
was
to
wander
over
europe
as
preachers
confessors
and
teachers
the
benedictines
were
too
numerous
wealthy
and
corrupt
to
be
reformed
they
had
become
a
scandal
they
had
lost
the
confidence
of
good
men
there
were
needed
more
active
partisans
of
the
pope
to
sustain
his
authority
the
new
universities
required
abler
professors
the
cities
sought
more
popular
preachers
the
great
desired
more
intelligent
confessors
the
crusades
had
created
a
new
field
of
enterprise
and
had
opened
to
the
eye
of
europe
a
wider
horizon
of
knowledge
the
universities
which
had
grown
up
around
the
cathedral
schools
had
kindled
a
spirit
of
inquiry
church
architecture
had
become
lighter
more
cheerful
and
more
symbolic
the
greek
philosophy
had
revealed
a
new
method
the
doctrines
of
the
church
if
they
did
not
require
a
new
system
yet
needed
or
were
supposed
to
need
the
aid
of
philosophy
for
the
questions
which
the
schoolmen
discussed
were
so
subtile
and
intricate
that
only
the
logic
of
aristotle
could
make
them
clear
now
the
mendicant
orders
entered
with
a
zeal
which
has
never
been
equalled
except
by
the
jesuits
into
all
the
inquiries
of
the
schools
and
kindled
a
new
religious
life
among
the
people
like
the
methodists
of
the
last
century
they
were
somewhat
similar
to
the
temperance
reformers
of
the
last
fifty
years
they
were
popular
zealous
intelligent
and
religious
so
great
were
their
talents
and
virtues
that
they
speedily
spread
over
europe
and
occupied
the
principal
pulpits
and
the
most
important
chairs
in
the
universities
bonaventura
albertus
magnus
thomas
aquinas
and
duns
scotus
were
the
great
ornaments
of
these
new
orders
their
peculiarity
in
contrast
with
the
old
orders
was
that
they
wandered
from
city
to
city
and
village
to
village
at
the
command
of
their
superiors
they
had
convents
like
the
other
monks
but
they
professed
absolute
poverty
went
barefooted
and
submitted
to
increased
rigors
their
vows
were
essentially
those
of
the
benedictines
in
less
than
a
century
however
they
too
had
degenerated
and
were
bitterly
reproached
for
their
vagabond
habits
and
the
violation
of
their
vows
their
convents
had
also
become
rich
like
those
of
the
benedictines
it
was
these
friars
whom
chaucer
ridiculed
and
against
whose
vices
wyclif
declaimed
yet
they
were
retained
by
the
popes
for
their
services
in
behalf
of
ecclesiastical
usurpation
it
was
they
who
were
especially
chosen
to
peddle
indulgences
their
history
is
an
impressive
confirmation
of
the
tendency
of
all
human
institutions
to
degenerate
it
would
seem
that
the
mission
of
the
benedictines
had
been
accomplished
in
the
thirteenth
century
and
that
of
the
dominicans
and
franciscans
in
the
fourteenth
but
monasticism
in
any
of
its
forms
ceased
to
have
a
salutary
influence
on
society
when
the
darkness
of
the
middle
ages
was
dispersed
it
is
peculiarly
a
mediaeval
institution
as
a
mediaeval
institution
it
conferred
many
benefits
on
the
of
europe
as
a
whole
considering
the
shadows
of
ignorance
and
superstition
which
veiled
christendom
and
the
evils
which
violence
produced
its
influence
was
beneficent
among
the
benefits
which
monastic
institutions
conferred
at
least
indirectly
may
be
mentioned
the
counteracting
influence
they
exerted
against
the
turbulence
and
tyranny
of
baronial
lords
whose
arrogance
and
extortion
they
rebuked
they
befriended
the
peasantry
they
enabled
poor
boys
to
rise
they
defended
the
doctrine
that
the
instructors
of
mankind
should
be
taken
from
all
classes
alike
they
were
democratic
in
their
sympathies
while
feudal
life
produced
haughtiness
and
scorn
they
welcomed
scholars
from
the
humblest
ranks
they
beheld
in
children
souls
which
could
be
ennobled
though
abbots
were
chosen
generally
from
the
upper
classes
yet
the
ordinary
monks
sprang
from
the
peasantry
for
instance
a
peasant
family
is
deprived
of
its
head
he
has
been
killed
while
fighting
for
a
feudal
lord
the
family
are
doomed
to
misery
and
hardship
no
aristocratic
tears
are
shed
for
them
they
are
no
better
than
dogs
or
cattle
the
mother
is
heartbroken
not
one
of
her
children
can
ordinarily
rise
from
their
abject
position
they
can
live
and
breathe
the
common
air
and
that
is
all
they
are
unmolested
in
their
mud
huts
if
they
will
toil
for
the
owner
of
their
village
at
the
foot
of
the
baronial
castle
but
one
of
her
sons
is
bright
and
religious
he
attracts
the
attention
of
a
sympathetic
monk
whose
venerable
retreat
is
shaded
with
trees
adorned
with
flowers
and
seated
perhaps
on
the
side
of
a
murmuring
stream
whose
banks
have
been
made
fertile
by
industry
and
beautiful
with
herds
of
cattle
and
flocks
of
sheep
he
urges
the
afflicted
mother
to
consecrate
him
to
the
service
of
the
church
and
the
boy
enters
the
sanctuary
and
is
educated
according
to
the
fashion
of
the
age
growing
up
a
sad
melancholy
austere
and
pharisaical
member
of
the
fraternity
whose
spirit
is
buried
in
a
gloomy
grave
of
ascetic
severities
he
passes
from
office
to
office
in
time
he
becomes
the
prior
of
his
convent
possibly
its
abbot
the
equal
of
that
proud
baron
in
whose
service
his
father
lost
his
life
the
controller
of
innumerable
acres
the
minister
of
kings
how
outside
the
church
could
he
thus
have
arisen
but
in
the
monastery
he
is
enabled
in
the
most
aristocratic
age
of
the
world
to
rise
to
the
highest
of
worldly
dignities
and
he
is
a
man
of
peace
and
not
of
war
he
hates
war
he
seeks
to
quell
dissensions
and
quarrels
he
believes
that
there
is
a
higher
than
the
warrior
excellence
monachism
recognized
what
feudalism
did
not
the
claims
of
man
as
man
in
this
respect
it
was
human
and
sympathetic
it
furnished
a
retreat
from
misery
and
oppression
it
favored
contemplative
habits
and
the
passive
virtues
so
much
needed
in
turbulent
times
whatever
faults
the
monks
had
it
must
be
allowed
that
they
alleviated
sufferings
and
presented
the
only
consolation
that
their
gloomy
and
iron
age
afforded
in
an
imperfect
manner
their
convents
answered
the
purpose
of
our
modern
hotels
hospitals
and
schools
it
was
benevolence
charity
and
piety
which
the
monks
aimed
to
secure
and
which
they
often
succeeded
in
diffusing
among
people
more
wretched

ignorant

abbot

archbishop
of

not
merely
a
great
prelate
but
a
great
theologian
resplendent
in
the
virtues
of
monastic
life
and
in
devotion
to
the
interests
of
the
church
he
was
one
of
the
first
to
create
an
intellectual
movement
in
europe
and
to
stimulate
theological
inquiries
anselm
was
born
at
aosta
in
italy
and
he
died
in
at
the
age
of
he
was
therefore
the
contemporary
of
hildebrand
of

of

of
roscelin
of
henry
iv
of

of
william
the
conqueror
of

he
saw
the
first
crusade
the
great
quarrel
about
investitures
and
the
establishment
of
the
normans
in
england
aosta
was
on
the
confines
of
lombardy
and
burgundy
in
a
mountainous
district
amid
rich
cornfields
and
fruitful
vines
and
dark
waving
chestnuts
in
sight
of
lofty
peaks
with
their
everlasting
snow
anselm
belonged
to
a
noble
but
impoverished
family
his
father
was
violent
and
unthrifty
but
his
mother
was
religious
and
prudent
he
was
by
nature
a
student
and
early
was
destined
to
monastic
life
the
only
life
favorable
to
the
development
of
the
intellect
in
a
rude
and
turbulent
age
i
have
already
alluded
to
the
general
ignorance
of
the
clergy
in
those
times
there
were
no
schools
of
any
note
at
this
period
and
no
convents
where
learning
was
cultivated
beyond
the
rudiments
of
grammar
and
arithmetic
and
the
writings
of
the
fathers
the
monks
could
read
and
talk
in
latin
of
a
barbarous
sort
which
was
the
common
language
of
the
learned
so
far
as
any
in
that
age
could
be
called
learned
the
most
famous
place
in
europe
at
that
time
where
learning
was
cultivated
was
the
abbey
of
bec
in
normandy
under
the
superintendence
of
the
archbishop
of
rouen
of
which
lanfranc
of
pavia
was
the
prior
it
was
the
first
abbey
in
normandy
to
open
the
door
of
learning
to
the
young
and
inquiring
minds
of
western
europe
it
was
a
benedictine
abbey
as
severe
in
its
rules
as
that
of
clairvaux
it
would
seem
that
the
fame
of
this
convent
and
of
lanfranc
its
presiding
genius
afterwards
the
great
archbishop
of
canterbury
reached
the
ears
of
anselm
so
that
on
the
death
of
his
parents
he
wandered
over
the
alps
through
burgundy
to
this
famous
school
where
the
best
teaching
of
the
day
was
to
be
had
lanfranc
cordially
welcomed
his
then
at
the
age
of
to
his
retreat
and
on
his
removal
three
years
afterwards
to
the
more
princely
abbey
of
stephen
in
caen
anselm
succeeded
him
as
prior
fifteen
years
later
he
became
abbot
and
ruled
the
abbey
for
fifteen
years
during
which
time
lanfranc
the
mutual
friend
of
william
the
conqueror
and
the
great
hildebrand
became
archbishop
of
canterbury
during
this
seclusion
of
thirty
years
in
the
abbey
of
bec
anselm
gave
himself
up
to
theological
and
philosophical
studies
and
became
known
both
as
a
profound
and
original
thinker
and
a
powerful
supporter
of
ecclesiastical
authority
the
scholastic
age
that
is
the
age
of
dialectics
when
theology
invoked
the
aid
of
philosophy
to
establish
the
truths
of
christianity
had
not
yet
begun
but
anselm
may
be
regarded
as
a
pioneer
the
precursor
of
thomas
aquinas
since
he
was
led
into
important
theological
controversies
to
establish
the
creed
of
saint
augustine
it
was
not
till
several
centuries
after
his
death
however
that
his
remarkable
originality
of
genius
was
fully
appreciated
he
anticipated
descartes
in
his
argument
to
prove
the
existence
of
god
he
is
generally
regarded
as
the
profoundest
intellect
among
the
early
schoolmen
and
the
most
original
that
appeared
in
the
church
after
saint
augustine
he
was
not
a
popular
preacher
like
saint
bernard
but
he
taught
theology
with
marvellous
lucidity
to
the
monks
who
sought
the
genial
quiet
of
his
convent
as
an
abbot
he
was
cheerful
and
humane
almost
to
frank
and
kind
to
everybody
an
exception
to
most
of
the
abbots
of
his
day
who
were
either
austere
and
rigid
or
convivial
and
worldly
he
was
a
man
whom
everybody
loved
and
trusted
yet
one
not
unmindful
of
his
duties
as
the
supreme
ruler
of
his
abbey
enforcing
discipline
while
favoring
relaxation
no
monk
ever
led
a
life
of
higher
meditation
than
he
absorbed
not
in
a
dreamy
and
visionary
piety
but
in
intelligent
inquiries
as
to
the
grounds
of
religious
belief
he
was
a
true
scholar
of
the
platonic
and
augustinian
school
not
a
dialectician
like
albertus
magnus
and
ab√©lard
but
a
man
who
went
beyond
words
to
things
and
seized
on
realities
rather
than
forms
not
given
to
disputations
and
the
sports
of
logical
tournaments
but
to
solid
inquiries
after
truth
the
universities
had
not
then
arisen
but
a
hundred
years
later
he
would
have
been
their
ornament
like
thomas
aquinas
and
bonaventura
like
other
norman
abbeys
the
abbey
of
bec
had
after
the
conquest
received
lands
in
england
and
it
became
one
of
the
duties
of
the
abbot
to
look
after
its
temporal
interests
hence
anselm
was
obliged
to
make
frequent
visits
to
england
where
his
friendship
with
lanfranc
was
renewed
and
where
he
made
the
acquaintance
of
distinguished
prelates
and
abbots
and
churchmen
among
others
of
eadmer
his
future
biographer
it
seems
that
he
also
won
the
hearts
of
the
english
nobility
by
his
gentleness
and
affability
so
that
they
rendered
to
him
uncommon
attentions
not
only
as
a
great
ecclesiastic
who
had
no
equal
in
learning
but
as
a
man
whom
they
could
not
help
loving
the
life
of
anselm
very
nearly
corresponded
with
that
of
the
conqueror
who
died
in
being
five
years
older
and
he
was
abbot
of
bec
during
the
whole
reign
of
william
as
king
of
england
there
was
nothing
particularly
memorable
in
his
life
as
abbot
aside
from
his
theological
studies
it
was
not
until
he
was
elevated
to
the
see
of
canterbury
on
the
death
of
lanfranc
that
his
memorable
career
became
historical
he
anticipated
thomas
becket
in
his
contest
to
secure
the
liberties
of
the
church
against
the
encroachments
of
the
norman
kings
the
cause
of
the
one
was
the
cause
of
the
other
only
anselm
was
trained
in
monastic
seclusion
and
becket
amid
the
tumults
and
intrigues
of
a
court
the
one
was
essentially
an
ecclesiastic
and
theologian
the
other
a
courtier
and
statesman
the
former
was
religious
and
the
latter
secular
in
his
habits
and
duties
yet
both
fought
the
same
great
battle
the
essential
principle
of
which
was
the
object
of
contention
between
the
popes
and
the
emperors
of
germany
that
pertaining
to
the
right
of
investiture
which
may
be
regarded
next
to
the
crusades
as
the
great
outward
event
of
the
twelfth
century
that
memorable
struggle
for
supremacy
was
not
brought
to
a
close
until
innocent
iii
made
the
kings
of
the
earth
his
vassals
and
reigned
without
a
rival
in
christendom
gregory
vii
had
fought
heroically
but
he
died
in
exile
leaving
to
future
popes
the
fruit
of
his
transcendent
labors
lanfranc
died
in
the
ablest
churchman
of
the
century
next
to
the
great
hildebrand
his
master
it
was
through
his
influence
that
england
was
more
closely
allied
with
rome
and
that
those
fetters
were
imposed
by
the
popes
which
the
ablest
of
the
norman
kings
were
unable
to
break
the
pope
had
sanctioned
the
atrocious
conquest
of
england
by
the
normans
beneficially
as
it
afterwards
turned
out
only
on
the
condition
that
extraordinary
powers
should
be
conferred
on
the
archbishop
of
canterbury
his
representative
in
enforcing
the
papal
claims
who
thus
became
virtually
independent
of
the
king
a
spiritual
monarch
of
such
dignity
that
he
was
almost
equal
to
his
sovereign
in
authority
there
was
no
such
see
in
germany
and
france
as
that
of
canterbury
its
mighty
and
lordly
metropolitan
had
the
exclusive
right
of
crowning
the
king
to
him
the
archbishop
of
york
once
his
equal
had
succumbed
he
was
not
merely
primate
but
had
the
supreme
control
of
the
church
in
england
he
could
depose
prelates
and
excommunicate
the
greatest
personages
he
enjoyed
enormous
revenues
he
was
vicegerent
of
the
pope
loth
was
william
to
concede
such
great
powers
to
the
pope
but
he
could
not
be
king
of
england
without
making
a
king
of
canterbury
so
he
made
choice
of
lanfranc
then
abbot
of
stephen
the
most
princely
of
the
norman
convents
for
the
highest
ecclesiastical
dignity
in
his
realm
and
perhaps
in
europe
after
the
papacy
itself
lanfranc
was
his
friend
and
also
the
friend
of
hildebrand
and
no
collision
took
place
between
them
for
neither
could
do
without
the
other
william
was
willing
to
waive
some
of
his
prerogatives
as
a
sovereign
for
such
a
kingdom
as
england
which
made
him
the
most
powerful
monarch
in
western
europe
since
he
ruled
the
fairest
part
of
france
and
the
whole
british
realm
the
united
possession
of
both
saxons
and
danes
with
more
absolute
authority
than
any
feudal
sovereign
at
that
time
possessed
his
victorious
knights
were
virtually
a
standing
army
bound
to
him
with
more
than
feudal
loyalty
since
he
divided
among
them
the
lands
of
the
conquered
saxons
and
gave
to
their
relatives
the
richest
benefices
of
the
church
with
the
aid
of
an
italian
prelate
bound
in
allegiance
to
the
pope
he
hoped
to
cement
his
conquest
lanfranc
did
as
he
wished
removed
the
saxon
bishops
and
gave
their
sees
to
normans
since
dunstan
no
great
saxon
bishop
had
arisen
the
saxon
bishops
were
feeble
and
indolent
and
were
not
capable
of
making
an
effective
resistance
but
lanfranc
was
even
more
able
than
dunstan
a
great
statesman
as
well
as
prelate
he
ruled
england
as
grand
justiciary
in
the
absence
of
the
monarch
and
was
thus
viceregent
of
the
kingdom
but
while
he
despoiled
the
saxon
prelates
he
would
suffer
no
royal
spoliation
of
the
norman
bishops
he
even
wrested
away
from
odo
of
the
conqueror
the
manors
he
held
as
count
of
kent
which
originally
belonged
to
the
see
of
canterbury
thus
was
william
with
all
his
greed
and
ambition
kept
in
check
by
the
spiritual
monarch
he
had
himself
made
so
powerful
on
the
death
of
this
great
prelate
all
eyes
were
turned
to
anselm
as
his
successor
who
was
then
abbot
of
bec
absorbed
in
his
studies
but
william
rufus
who
had
in
the
mean
time
succeeded
to
the
throne
of
the
conqueror
did
not
at
once
appoint
any
one
to
the
vacant
see
since
he
had
seized
and
used
its
revenues
to
the
scandal
of
the
nation
and
the
indignation
of
the
church
for
five
years
there
was
no
primate
in
england
and
no
archbishop
of
canterbury
at
last
what
seemed
to
be
a
mortal
sickness
seized
the
king
and
in
the
near
prospect
of
death
he
summoned
anselm
to
his
chamber
and
conferred
upon
him
the
exalted
dignity
which
anselm
refused
to
accept
dreading
the
burdens
of
the
office
and
preferring
the
quiet
life
of
a
scholar
in
his
norman
abbey
like
thomas
aquinas
in
the
next
century
who
refused
the
archbishopric
of
naples
to
pursue
his
philosophical
studies
in
paris
anselm
declined
the
primacy
of
the
church
in
england
with
its
cares
and
labors
and
responsibilities
that
he
might
be
unmolested
in
his
theological
inquiries
he
understood
the
position
in
which
he
should
be
placed
and
foresaw
that
he
should
be
brought
in
collision
with
his
sovereign
if
he
would
faithfully
guard
the
liberties
and
interests
of
the
church
he
was
a
man
of
peace
and
meditation
and
hated
conflict
turmoil
and
active
life
he
knew
that
one
of
the
requirements
of
a
great
prelate
is
to
have
business
talents
more
necessary
perhaps
than
eloquence
or
learning
at
last
however
on
the
pressing
solicitation
of
the
pope
the
king
and
the
clergy
he
consented
to
mount
the
throne
of
lanfranc
on
condition
that
the
temporalities
privileges
and
powers
of
the
see
of
canterbury
should
not
be
attacked
the
crafty
and
rapacious
but
now
penitent
monarch
thinking
he
was
about
to
die
and
wishing
to
make
his
peace
with
heaven
made
all
the
concessions
required
and
the
quiet
monk
and
doctor
whom
everybody
loved
and
revered
was
enthroned
and
consecrated
as
the
spiritual
monarch
of
england
anselm
memorable
career
as
bishop
began
in
peace
but
was
soon
clouded
by
a
desperate
quarrel
with
his
sovereign
as
he
had
anticipated
this
learned
and
theologian
was
forced
into
a
contest
which
stands
out
in
history
like
the
warfare
between
hildebrand
and
henry
iv
it
was
the
beginning
of
that
fierce
contest
in
england
which
was
made
memorable
by
the
martyrdom
of
becket
anselm
when
consecrated
was
sixty
years
of
age
a
period
of
life
when
men
are
naturally
timid
cautious
and
averse
to
innovations
quarrels
and
physical
discomforts
the
friendly
relations
between
william
rufus
and
anselm
were
disturbed
when
the
former
sought
to
exact
large
sums
of
money
from
his
subjects
to
carry
on
war
against
his
brother
robert
among
those
who
were
expected
to
make
heavy
contributions
in
the
shape
of
presents
was
the
archbishop
of
canterbury
whose
revenues
were
enormous
perhaps
the
largest
in
the
realm
next
to
those
of
the
king
anselm
offered
as
his
contribution
five
hundred
marks
what
would
now
be
equal
to
a
large
sum
in
those
days
but
not
as
much
as
the
norman
sovereign
expected
in
indignation
he
refused
the
present
which
seemed
to
him
meagre
especially
since
it
was
accompanied
with
words
of
seeming
reproof
for
anselm
had
said
that
a
free
gift
which
he
meant
this
to
be
was
better
than
a
forced
and
servile
contribution
the
king
then
angrily
bade
him
begone
that
he
wanted
neither
his
money
nor
his
scolding
the
courtiers
tried
to
prevail
on
the
prelate
to
double
the
amount
of
his
present
and
thus
regain
the
royal
favor
but
he
firmly
refused
to
do
this
since
it
looked
to
him
like
a
corrupt
bargain
anselm
having
distributed
among
the
poor
the
money
which
the
king
had
refused
left
the
court
as
soon
as
the
christmas
festival
was
over
and
retired
to
his
diocese
preserving
his
independence
and
dignity
a
breach
had
not
been
made
but
the
irritation
was
followed
by
coolness
and
this
was
increased
when
anselm
desired
to
have
the
religious
posts
filled
the
revenues
of
which
the
king
had
too
long
enjoyed
and
when
in
addition
he
demanded
a
council
of
bishops
to
remedy
the
disorders
and
growing
evils
of
the
kingdom
this
council
the
angry
king
refused
with
a
sneer
saying
he
would
call
the
council
when
he
himself
pleased
not
when
anselm
pleased
as
to
the
filling
the
vacancies
of
the
abbeys
he
further
replied
what
are
abbeys
to
are
they
not
go
and
do
what
you
like
with
your
farms
and
i
will
do
what
i
please
with
my
abbeys
so
they
parted
these
two
potentates
the
king
saying
to
his
companions
i
hated
him
yesterday
i
hate
him
more
and
i
shall
hate
him
still
more
i
refuse
alike
his
blessings
and
his
prayers
his
chief
desire
now
was
to
get
rid
of
the
man
he
had
elevated
to
the
throne
of
canterbury
it
may
be
observed
that
it
was
not
the
pope
who
made
this
appointment
but
the
king
of
england
yet
by
the
rules
long
established
by
the
popes
and
accepted
by
christendom
it
was
necessary
that
an
archbishop
before
he
could
fully
exercise
his
spiritual
powers
should
go
to
rome
and
receive
at
the
hands
of
the
pope
his
or
white
woollen
stole
as
the
badge
of
his
office
and
dignity
lanfranc
had
himself
gone
to
rome
for
this
purpose
and
a
journey
from
canterbury
to
rome
in
the
eleventh
century
was
no
small
undertaking
being
expensive
and
fatiguing
but
there
were
now
at
rome
two
rival
popes
which
one
should
anselm
recognize
france
and
normandy
acknowledged
urban
england
was
undecided
whether
it
should
be
urban
or
clement
william
would
probably
recognize
the
one
that
anselm
did
not
for
a
rupture
was
certain
and
the
king
sought
for
a
pretext
so
when
the
archbishop
asked
leave
of
the
king
to
go
to
rome
according
to
custom
william
demanded
to
know
to
which
of
these
two
popes
he
would
apply
for
his
pallium
to
pope
urban
was
the
reply
but
said
the
king
him
i
have
not
acknowledged
and
no
man
in
england
may
acknowledge
a
pope
without
my
leave
at
first
view
the
matter
was
a
small
one
comparatively
whether
urban
was
or
was
not
the
true
pope
the
real
point
was
whether
the
king
of
england
should
accept
as
pope
the
man
whom
the
archbishop
recognized
or
whether
the
archbishop
should
acknowledge
him
whom
the
king
had
accepted
this
could
be
settled
only
by
a
grand
council
of
the
nation
to
whom
the
matter
should
be
submitted
virtually
a
parliament
this
council
demanded
by
anselm
met
in
the
royal
castle
of
rockingham
composed
of
nobles
bishops
and
abbots
a
large
majority
of
the
council
were
in
the
interests
of
the
king
and
the
subject
at
issue
was
virtually
whether
the
king
or
the
prelate
was
supreme
in
spiritual
matters
a
point
which
the
conqueror
had
ceded
to
lanfranc
and
hildebrand
this
council
insulted
and
worried
the
primate
and
sought
to
frighten
him
into
submission
but
submission
was
to
yield
up
the
liberties
of
the
church
the
intrepid
prelate
was
not
prepared
for
this
and
he
appealed
from
the
council
to
the
pope
thereby
putting
himself
in
antagonism
to
the
king
and
a
majority
of
the
peers
of
the
realm
the
king
was
exasperated
but
foiled
while
the
council
was
perplexed
the
bishop
of
durham
saw
no
solution
but
in
violence
but
violence
to
the
metropolitan
was
too
bold
a
measure
to
be
seriously
entertained
the
king
hoped
that
anselm
would
resign
as
his
situation
was
very
unpleasant
but
resignation
would
be
an
act
of
cowardice
and
would
result
in
the
appointment
of
an
archbishop
favorable
to
the
encroachments
of
the
king
who
doubtless
aimed
at
the
subversion
of
the
liberties
of
the
church
and
greater
independence
five
centuries
later
the
sympathies
of
england
would
have
been
on
his
side
but
the
english
nation
felt
differently
in
the
eleventh
century
all
christendom
sympathized
with
the
pope
for
this
resistance
of
anselm
to
the
king
was
the
cause
of
the
popes
themselves
against
the
monarchs
of
europe
anselm
simply
acted
as
the
vicegerent
of
the
pope
to
submit
to
the
dictation
of
the
king
in
a
spiritual
matter
was
to
undermine
the
authority
of
rome
i
do
not
attempt
to
settle
the
merits
of
the
question
but
only
to
describe
the
contest
to
settle
the
merits
of
such
a
question
is
to
settle
the
question
whether
the
papal
power
in
its
plenitude
was
good
or
evil
for
society
in
the
middle
ages
one
thing
seems
certain
that
the
king
was
thus
far
foiled
by
the
firmness
of
a
churchman
the
man
who
had
passed
the
greater
part
of
his
life
in
a
convent
studying
and
teaching
theology
one
of
the
mildest
and
meekest
men
ever
elevated
to
high
ecclesiastical
office
anselm
was
sustained
by
the
power
of
conscience
by
an
imperative
sense
of
duty
by
allegiance
to
his
spiritual
head
he
indeed
owed
fealty
to
the
king
but
only
for
the
temporalities
of
his
see
his
paramount
obligations
as
an
archbishop
were
according
to
all
the
ideas
of
his
age
to
the
supreme
pontiff
of
christendom
doubtless
his
life
would
have
been
easier
and
more
pleasant
had
he
been
more
submissive
to
the
king
he
could
have
brought
all
the
bishops
as
well
as
barons
to
acknowledge
the
supremacy
but
on
his
shoulders
was
laid
the
burden
of
sustaining
ecclesiastical
authority
in
england
he
had
anticipated
this
burden
and
would
have
joyfully
been
exempted
from
its
weight
but
having
assumed
it
perhaps
against
his
will
he
had
only
one
course
to
pursue
according
to
the
ideas
of
the
age
and
this
was
to
maintain
the
supreme
authority
of
the
pope
in
england
in
all
spiritual
matters
it
was
remarkable
that
at
this
stage
of
the
contest
the
barons
took
his
side
and
the
bishops
took
the
side
of
the
king
the
barons
feared
for
their
own
privileges
should
the
monarch
be
successful
for
they
knew
his
unscrupulous
and
tyrannical
character
that
he
would
encroach
on
these
and
make
himself
as
absolute
as
possible
the
bishops
were
weak
and
worldly
men
and
either
did
not
realize
the
gravity
of
the
case
or
wished
to
gain
the
royal
favor
they
were
nearly
all
norman
nobles
who
had
been
under
obligations
to
the
crown
the
king
however
understood
and
appreciated
his
position
he
could
not
afford
to
quarrel
with
the
pope
he
dared
not
do
violence
to
the
primate
of
the
realm
so
he
dissembled
his
designs
and
restrained
his
wrath
and
sought
to
gain
by
cunning
what
he
could
not
openly
effect
by
the
exercise
of
royal
power
he
sent
messengers
and
costly
gifts
to
rome
such
as
the
needy
and
greedy
servants
of
the
servants
of
god
rarely
disdained
he
sought
to
conciliate
the
pope
and
begged
as
a
favor
that
the
pallium
should
be
sent
to
him
as
monarch
and
given
by
him
with
the
papal
sanction
to
the
archbishop
the
name
of
anselm
being
suppressed
this
favor
being
bought
by
potent
arguments
was
granted
unwisely
and
the
pallium
was
sent
to
william
with
the
greatest
secrecy
in
return
the
king
acknowledged
the
claims
of
urban
as
pope
so
anselm
did
not
go
to
rome
for
the
emblem
of
his
power
the
king
having
succeeded
thus
far
then
demanded
of
the
pope
the
deposition
of
anselm
he
could
not
himself
depose
the
archbishop
he
could
elevate
him
but
not
remove
him
he
could
make
but
not
unmake
only
he
who
held
the
keys
of
saint
peter
who
was
armed
with
spiritual
omnipotence
could
reverse
his
own
decrees
and
rule
arbitrarily
but
for
any
king
to
expect
that
the
pope
would
part
with
the
ablest
defender
of
the
liberties
of
the
church
and
disgrace
him
for
being
faithful
to
papal
interests
was
absurd
the
pope
may
have
used
smooth
words
but
was
firm
in
the
uniform
policy
of
all
his
predecessors
meanwhile
political
troubles
came
so
thick
and
heavy
on
the
king
some
of
his
powerful
nobles
being
in
open
rebellion
that
he
felt
it
necessary
to
dissemble
and
defer
the
gratification
of
his
vengeance
on
the
man
he
hated
more
than
any
personage
in
england
he
pretended
to
restore
anselm
to
favor
bygones
should
be
bygones
the
king
and
the
archbishop
sat
at
dinner
at
windsor
with
friends
and
nobles
while
an
ironical
courtier
pleasantly
quoted
the
psalmist
behold
how
good
and
how
pleasant
it
is
for
brethren
to
dwell
together
in
unity
the
king
now
supposed
that
anselm
would
receive
the
pallium
at
his
royal
hands
which
the
prelate
warily
refused
to
accept
the
subject
was
carefully
dropped
but
as
the
pallium
was
saint
peter
gift
it
was
brought
to
canterbury
and
placed
upon
the
altar
and
the
archbishop
condescended
amid
much
pomp
and
ceremony
to
take
it
thence
and
put
it
on
a
sort
of
puerile
concession
for
the
sake
of
peace
the
king
too
wishing
conciliation
for
the
present
until
he
had
gained
the
possession
of
normandy
from
his
brother
robert
who
had
embarked
in
the
crusades
and
feeling
that
he
could
ill
afford
to
quarrel
with
the
highest
dignitary
of
his
kingdom
until
his
political
ambition
was
gratified
treated
anselm
with
affected
kindness
until
his
ill
success
with
the
celtic
welsh
put
him
in
a
bad
humor
and
led
to
renewed
hostility
he
complained
that
anselm
had
not
furnished
his
proper
contingent
of
forces
for
the
conquest
of
wales
and
summoned
him
to
his
court
in
a
secular
matter
like
this
anselm
as
a
subject
had
no
remedy
refusal
to
appear
would
be
regarded
as
treason
and
rebellion
yet
he
neglected
to
obey
the
summons
perhaps
fearing
violence
and
sought
counsel
from
the
pope
he
asked
permission
to
go
to
rome
the
request
was
angrily
refused
again
he
renewed
his
request
and
again
it
was
denied
him
with
threats
if
he
departed
without
leave
the
barons
now
against
him
thought
he
had
no
right
to
leave
his
post
the
bishops
even
urged
him
not
to
go
to
all
of
whom
he
replied
you
wish
me
to
swear
that
i
will
not
appeal
to
saint
peter
to
swear
this
is
to
forswear
saint
peter
to
forswear
saint
peter
is
to
forswear
christ
at
last
it
seems
that
the
king
gave
a
reluctant
consent
but
with
messages
that
were
insulting
and
anselm
with
a
pilgrim
staff
took
leave
of
his
monks
for
the
chapter
of
canterbury
was
composed
of
monks
set
out
for
dover
and
reached
the
continent
in
safety
thus
began
says
church
the
system
of
appeals
to
rome
and
of
inviting
foreign
interference
in
the
home
affairs
of
england
and
anselm
was
the
beginning
of
it
but
however
unfortunate
it
ultimately
proved
it
was
in
accordance
with
the
ideas
and
customs
of
the
middle
ages
without
which
the
papal
power
could
not
have
been
so
successfully
established
and
i
take
the
ground
that
the
papacy
was
an
institution
of
which
very
much
may
be
said
in
its
favor
in
the
dark
ages
of
european
society
especially
in
restraining
the
tyranny
of
kings
and
the
turbulence
of
nobles
governments
are
based
on
expediencies
and
changing
circumstances
not
on
immutable
principles
or
divine
rights
if
this
be
not
true
we
are
driven
to
accept
as
the
true
form
of
government
that
which
was
recognized
by
christ
and
his
disciples
the
feudal
kings
of
europe
claimed
a
divine
right
and
professed
to
reign
by
the
grace
of
god
whence
was
this
right
derived
if
it
can
be
substantiated
on
what
claim
rests
the
sovereignty
of
the
people
are
not
popes
and
kings
and
bishops
alike
the
creation
of
circumstances
good
or
evil
inventions
as
they
meet
the
wants
of
society
anselm
felt
himself
to
be
the
subject
of
the
pope
as
well
as
of
the
king
but
that
as
a
priest
his
supreme
allegiance
should
be
given
to
the
pope
as
the
spiritual
head
of
the
church
and
vicegerent
of
christ
upon
the
earth
we
differ
from
him
in
his
view
of
the
claims
of
the
pope
which
he
regarded
as
based
on
immutable
truth
and
the
fiat
of
almighty
power
even
as
richelieu
looked
upon
the
imbecile
king
whom
he
served
as
reigning
by
divine
right
the
protestant
reformation
demolished
the
claims
of
the
spiritual
potentate
as
the
french
revolution
swept
away
the
claims
of
the
temporal
monarch
the
logic
of
events
is
the
only
logic
which
substantiates
the
claims
of
rulers
and
this
logic
means
in
our
day
constitutional
government
in
politics
and
private
judgment
in
religion
the
free
choice
of
such
public
servants
whatever
their
titles
of
honor
in
state
and
church
as
the
exigencies
and
circumstances
of
society
require
the
haughtiest
of
the
popes
in
the
proudest
period
of
their
absolute
ascendancy
never
rejected
their
early
title
servant
of
the
servants
of
god
wherever
there
is
real
liberty
among
the
people
whose
sovereignty
is
acknowledged
as
the
source
of
power
the
ruler
a
servant
of
the
people
and
not
their
tyrant
however
great
the
authority
which
they
delegate
to
him
which
they
alone
may
continue
or
take
away
absolute
authority
delegated
to
kings
or
popes
by
god
was
the
belief
of
the
middle
ages
limited
authority
delegated
to
rulers
by
the
people
is
the
idea
of
our
times
what
the
next
invention
in
government
may
be
no
one
can
tell
but
whatever
it
be
it
will
be
in
accordance
with
the
ideas
and
altered
circumstances
of
progressive
ages
no
one
can
anticipate
or
foresee
the
revolutions
in
human
thought
and
therefore
in
human
governments
till
he
shall
come
whose
right
it
is
to
reign
taking
it
then
to
be
the
established
idea
of
the
middle
ages
that
all
ecclesiastics
owed
supreme
allegiance
to
the
visible
head
of
the
church
no
one
can
blame
anselm
for
siding
with
the
pope
rather
than
with
his
sovereign
in
spiritual
matters
he
would
have
been
disloyal
to
his
conscience
if
he
had
not
been
true
to
his
clerical
vows
of
obedience
conscience
may
be
unenlightened
yet
take
away
the
power
of
conscience
and
what
would
become
of
our
world
what
is
a
man
without
a
conscience
he
is
a
usurper
a
tyrant
a
libertine
a
spendthrift
a
robber
a
miser
an
idler
a
trifler
whatever
he
is
tempted
to
be
a
supreme
egotist
who
says
in
his
heart
there
is
no
god
the
almighty
creator
placed
this
instinct
in
the
soul
of
man
to
prevent
the
total
eclipse
of
faith
and
to
preserve
some
allegiance
to
him
some
guidance
in
the
trials
and
temptations
of
life
we
lament
a
perverted
conscience
yet
better
this
than
no
conscience
at
all
a
voice
silenced
by
the
combined
forces
of
evil
a
man
obey
this
voice
it
is
the
wisdom
of
the
ages
to
make
it
harmonious
with
eternal
right
it
is
the
power
of
god
to
remove
or
weaken
the
assailing
forces
which
pervert
or
silence
it
see
then
this
gentle
lovable
and
meditative
scholar
not
haughty
like
dunstan
not
arrogant
like
becket
not
sacerdotal
like
ambrose
not
passionate
like
chrysostom
but
meek
as
moses
is
said
to
have
been
before
pharaoh
although
i
never
could
see
this
distinguishing
trait
in
the
hebrew
leader
yet
firmly
and
heroically
braving
the
wrath
of
the
sovereign
who
had
elevated
him
and
pursuing
his
toilsome
journey
to
rome
to
appeal
to
justice
against
injustice
to
law
against
violence
he
reached
the
old
capital
of
the
world
in
midwinter
after
having
spent
christmas
in
that
hospitable
convent
where
hildebrand
had
reigned
and
which
was
to
shield
the
persecuted
ab√©lard
from
the
wrath
of
his
ecclesiastical
tormentors
he
was
most
honorably
received
by
the
pope
and
lodged
in
the
lateran
as
the
great
champion
of
papal
authority
vainly
did
he
beseech
the
pope
to
relieve
him
from
his
dignities
and
burdens
for
such
a
man
could
not
be
spared
from
the
exalted
post
in
which
he
had
been
placed
as
he
was
his
destiny
was
to
fight
battles
in
the
following
year
pope
urban
died
and
in
the
following
year
william
rufus
himself
was
accidentally
killed
in
the
new
forest
his
death
was
not
much
lamented
he
having
proved
hard
unscrupulous
cunning
and
tyrannical
at
this
period
the
kings
of
england
reigned
with
almost
despotic
power
independent
of
barons
and
oppressive
to
the
people
william
had
but
little
regard
for
the
interests
of
the
kingdom
he
built
neither
churches
nor
convents
but
westminster
hall
was
the
memorial
of
his
iron
reign
much
was
expected
of
henry
who
immediately
recalled
anselm
from
lyons
where
he
was
living
in
voluntary
exile
he
returned
to
canterbury
with
the
firm
intention
of
reforming
the
morals
of
the
clergy
and
resisting
royal
encroachments
henry
was
equally
resolved
on
making
bishops
as
well
as
nobles
subservient
to
him
of
course
harmony
and
concord
could
not
long
exist
between
such
men
with
such
opposite
views
even
at
the
first
interview
of
the
king
with
the
archbishop
at
salisbury
he
demanded
a
renewal
of
homage
by
a
new
act
of
investiture
which
was
virtually
a
continuance
of
the
quarrel
it
was
however
mutually
agreed
that
the
matter
should
be
referred
to
the
new
pope
anselm
on
his
part
knew
that
the
appeal
was
hopeless
while
the
king
wished
to
gain
time
it
was
not
long
before
the
answer
of
pope
pascal
came
he
was
willing
that
henry
should
have
many
favors
but
not
this
only
the
head
of
the
church
could
bestow
the
emblems
of
spiritual
authority
on
receiving
the
papal
reply
the
king
summoned
his
nobles
and
bishops
to
his
court
and
required
that
anselm
should
acknowledge
the
right
of
the
king
to
invest
prelates
with
the
badges
of
spiritual
authority
the
result
was
a
second
embassy
to
the
pope
of
more
distinguished
persons
the
archbishop
of
york
and
two
other
prelates
the
pope
of
course
remained
inflexible
on
the
return
of
the
envoys
a
great
council
was
assembled
in
london
and
anselm
again
was
required
to
submit
to
the
king
will
it
seems
that
the
pope
from
motives
of
policy
for
all
the
popes
were
reluctant
to
quarrel
with
princes
had
given
the
envoys
assurance
that
so
long
as
henry
was
a
good
king
he
should
not
be
disturbed
and
that
oral
declarations
were
contrary
to
his
written
documents
this
contradiction
and
double
dealing
required
a
new
embassy
to
rome
but
in
the
mean
time
the
king
gave
the
see
of
salisbury
to
his
chancellor
and
that
of
hereford
to
the
superintendent
of
his
larder
when
the
answer
of
the
pope
was
finally
received
it
was
found
that
he
indignantly
disavowed
the
verbal
message
and
excommunicated
the
three
prelates
as
liars
but
the
king
was
not
disconcerted
he
suddenly
appeared
at
canterbury
and
told
anselm
that
further
opposition
would
be
followed
by
the
royal
enmity
yet
mollifying
his
wrath
requested
anselm
himself
to
go
to
rome
and
do
what
he
could
with
the
pope
anselm
assured
him
that
he
could
do
nothing
to
the
prejudice
of
the
church
he
departed
however
the
king
obviously
wishing
him
out
of
the
way
the
second
journey
of
anselm
to
rome
was
a
perpetual
ovation
but
was
of
course
barren
of
results
the
pope
remained
inflexible
and
anselm
prepared
to
return
to
england
but
from
the
friendly
hints
of
the
prelates
who
accompanied
him
he
sojourned
again
at
lyons
with
his
friend
the
archbishop
both
the
pope
and
the
king
had
compromised
anselm
alone
was
straightforward
and
fearless
as
a
consequence
his
revenues
were
seized
and
he
remained
in
exile
he
had
been
willing
to
do
the
pope
bidding
had
he
made
an
exception
to
the
canons
but
so
long
as
the
law
remained
in
force
he
had
nothing
to
do
but
conform
to
it
he
remained
in
lyons
a
year
and
a
half
while
henry
continued
his
negotiations
with
pascal
but
finding
that
nothing
was
accomplished
anselm
resolved
to
excommunicate
his
sovereign
the
report
of
this
intention
alarmed
henry
then
preparing
for
a
decisive
conflict
with
his
brother
robert
the
excommunication
would
at
least
be
inconvenient
it
might
cost
him
his
crown
so
he
sought
an
interview
with
anselm
at
the
castle
of
and
became
outwardly
reconciled
and
restored
to
him
his
revenues
the
end
of
the
dreary
contest
came
at
last
in
after
vexatious
delays
and
intrigues
it
was
settled
by
compromise
as
most
quarrels
are
settled
as
most
institutions
are
established
outwardly
the
king
yielded
he
agreed
in
an
assembly
of
nobles
bishops
and
abbots
at
london
that
henceforth
no
one
should
be
invested
with
bishopric
or
abbacy
either
by
king
or
layman
by
the
customary
badges
of
ring
and
crosier
anselm
on
his
part
agreed
that
no
prelate
should
be
refused
consecration
who
was
nominated
by
the
king
the
appointment
of
bishops
remained
with
the
king
but
the
consecration
could
be
withheld
by
the
primate
since
he
alone
had
the
right
to
give
the
badges
of
office
without
which
spiritual
functions
could
not
be
lawfully
performed
it
was
a
moral
victory
to
the
church
but
the
victory
of
an
unpopular
cause
it
cemented
the
power
of
the
pope
while
freedom
from
papal
interference
has
ever
been
dear
to
the
english
nation
when
anselm
had
fought
this
great
fight
he
died
in
the
sixteenth
year
of
his
reign
as
primate
of
the
church
in
england
and
was
buried
next
to
lanfranc
in
his
abbey
church
his
career
outwardly
is
memorable
only
for
this
contest
which
was
afterwards
renewed
by
thomas
becket
with
a
greater
king
than
either
william
rufus
or
henry
i
it
is
interesting
since
it
was
a
part
of
the
great
struggle
between
the
spiritual
and
temporal
powers
for
two
hundred
years
from
hildebrand
to
innocent
iii
this
was
only
one
of
the
phases
of
the
quarrel
one
of
the
battles
of
a
long
war
not
between
popes
and
emperors
as
in
germany
and
italy
but
between
a
king
and
the
vicegerent
of
a
pope
a
king
and
his
subject
the
one
armed
with
secular
the
other
with
spiritual
weapons
it
was
only
brought
to
an
end
by
an
appeal
to
the
fears
of
men
the
dread
of
excommunication
and
consequent
torments
in
hell
which
was
the
great
governing
idea
of
the
middle
ages
the
means
by
which
the
clergy
controlled
the
laity
abused
and
perverted
as
this
idea
was
it
indicates
and
presupposes
a
general
belief
in
the
personality
of
god
in
rewards
and
punishments
in
a
future
state
and
the
necessity
of
conforming
to
the
divine
laws
as
expounded
and
enforced
by
the
christian
church
hence
the
dark
ages
have
been
called
ages
of
faith
it
now
remains
to
us
to
contemplate
anselm
as
a
theologian
and
philosopher
a
more
interesting
view
for
in
this
aspect
his
character
is
more
genial
and
his
influence
more
extended
and
permanent
he
is
one
of
the
first
who
revived
theological
studies
in
europe
he
did
not
teach
in
the
universities
as
a
scholastic
doctor
but
he
was
one
who
prepared
the
way
for
universities
by
the
stimulus
he
gave
to
philosophy
it
was
in
his
abbey
of
bec
that
he
laid
the
foundation
of
a
new
school
of
theological
inquiry
in
original
genius
he
was
surpassed
by
no
scholastic
in
the
middle
ages
although
both
ab√©lard
and
thomas
aquinas
enjoyed
a
greater
fame
it
was
for
his
learning
and
sanctity
that
he
was
canonized
and
singularly
enough
by
alexander
the
worst
pope
who
ever
reigned
still
more
singular
is
it
that
the
last
of
his
successors
as
abbot
of
bec
was
the
diplomatist
talleyrand
one
of
the
most
worldly
and
secular
of
all
the
ecclesiastical
dignitaries
of
an
infidel
age
the
theology
of
the
middle
ages
of
which
anselm
was
one
of
the
greatest
expounders
certainly
the
most
profound
was
that
which
was
systematized
by
saint
augustine
from
the
writings
of
paul
augustine
was
the
oracle
of
the
latin
church
until
the
council
of
trent
and
nominally
his
authority
has
never
been
repudiated
by
the
catholic
church
but
he
was
no
more
the
father
of
the
catholic
theology
than
he
was
of
the
protestant
as
taught
by
john
calvin
these
two
great
theologians
were
in
harmony
in
all
essential
doctrines
as
completely
as
were
augustine
and
anselm
or
augustine
and
thomas
aquinas
the
doctrines
of
theology
as
formulated
by
augustine
were
subjects
of
contemplation
and
study
in
all
the
convents
of
the
middle
ages
in
spite
of
the
prevailing
ignorance
it
was
impossible
that
inquiring
men
secluded
in
gloomy
monasteries
should
find
food
for
their
minds
in
the
dreary
and
monotonous
duties
to
which
monks
were
doomed
a
life
devoted
to
alternate
manual
labor
and
mechanical
religious
services
there
would
be
some
of
them
who
would
speculate
on
the
lofty
subjects
which
were
the
constant
themes
of
their
meditations
bishops
were
absorbed
in
their
practical
duties
as
executive
rulers
village
priests
were
too
ignorant
to
do
much
beyond
looking
after
the
wants
of
hinds
and
peasants
the
only
scholarly
men
were
the
monks
and
although
the
number
of
these
was
small
they
have
the
honor
of
creating
the
first
intellectual
movement
since
the
fall
of
the
roman
empire
they
alone
combined
leisure
with
these
intellectual
and
inquiring
monks
as
far
back
as
the
ninth
century
speculated
on
the
great
subjects
of
christian
faith
with
singular
boldness
considering
the
general
ignorance
which
veiled
europe
in
melancholy
darkness
some
of
them
were
logically
led
to
a
secret
mutiny
and
insurrection
against
the
doctrines
which
were
universally
received
this
insurrection
of
human
intelligence
gave
great
alarm
to
the
orthodox
leaders
of
the
church
and
to
suppress
it
the
church
raised
up
conservative
dialecticians
as
acute
and
able
as
those
who
strove
for
emancipation
at
first
they
used
the
weapons
of
natural
reason
but
afterwards
employed
the
logic
and
method
of
aristotle
as
translated
into
latin
from
the
arabic
to
assist
them
in
their
intellectual
combats
gradually
the
movement
centred
in
the
scholastic
philosophy
as
a
bulwark
to
catholic
theology
but
this
was
nearly
a
hundred
years
after
the
time
of
anselm
who
himself
was
not
enslaved
by
the
technicalities
of
a
complicated
system
of
dialectics
naturally
the
first
subject
which
was
suggested
to
the
minds
of
inquiring
monks
was
the
being
and
attributes
of
god
he
was
the
beginning
and
end
of
their
meditations
it
was
to
meditate
upon
god
that
the
oriental
recluse
sought
the
deserts
of
asia
minor
and
egypt
like
the
eastern
monk
of
the
fourth
century
he
sought
to
know
the
essence
and
nature
of
the
deity
he
worshipped
there
arose
before
his
mind
the
great
doctrines
of
the
trinity
the
incarnation
and
redemption
closely
connected
with
these
were
predestination
and
grace
and
then
fixed
fate
foreknowledge
absolute
on
these
mysteries
he
could
not
help
meditating
and
with
meditation
came
speculation
on
unfathomable
subjects
pertaining
to
god
and
his
relations
with
man
to
the
nature
of
sin
and
its
penalty
to
the
freedom
of
the
will
and
eternal
decrees
the
monk
became
first
a
theologian
and
then
a
philosopher
whether
of
the
school
of
plato
or
of
aristotle
he
did
not
know
he
began
to
speculate
on
questions
which
had
agitated
the
grecian
schools
the
origin
of
evil
and
of
matter
whether
the
world
was
created
or
uncreated
whether
there
is
a
distinction
between
things
visible
and
invisible
whether
we
derive
our
knowledge
from
sensation
or
reflection
whether
the
soul
is
necessarily
immortal
how
is
to
be
reconciled
with
god
eternal
decrees
or
what
the
greeks
called
fate
whether
ideas
are
eternal
or
are
the
creation
of
our
own
minds
these
and
other
more
subtile
questions
like
the
nature
of
angels
began
to
agitate
the
convent
in
the
ninth
century
it
was
then
that
the
monk
gottschalk
revived
the
question
of
predestination
which
had
slumbered
since
the
time
of
saint
augustine
although
the
bishop
of
hippo
was
the
oracle
of
the
church
and
no
one
disputed
his
authority
it
would
seem
that
his
characteristic
doctrine
that
of
grace
the
essential
doctrine
of
luther
also
was
never
a
favorite
one
with
the
great
churchmen
of
the
middle
ages
they
did
not
dispute
saint
augustine
but
they
adhered
to
penances
and
expiations
which
entered
so
largely
into
the
piety
of
the
middle
ages
the
idea
of
penances
and
expiations
pushed
to
their
utmost
logical
sequence
was
salvation
by
works
and
not
by
faith
grace
as
understood
by
the
fathers
was
closely
allied
to
predestination
it
disdained
the
elaborate
and
cumbrous
machinery
of
ecclesiastical
discipline
on
which
the
power
of
the
clergy
was
based
grace
was
opposed
to
penance
while
penance
was
the
form
which
religion
took
and
as
predestination
was
a
theological
sequence
of
grace
it
was
distasteful
to
the
mediaeval
church
both
grace
and
predestination
tended
to
undermine
the
system
of
penance
then
universally
accepted
the
great
churchmen
of
the
middle
ages
were
plainly
at
war
with
their
great
oracle
in
this
matter
without
being
fully
aware
of
their
real
antagonism
so
they
made
an
onslaught
on
gottschalk
as
opposed
to
those
ideas
on
which
sacerdotal
power
rested
especially
did
hincmar
archbishop
of
rheims
the
greatest
prelate
of
that
age
persecuted
gottschalk
appealed
to
reason
rather
than
authority
thus
anticipating
luther
by
five
hundred
years
an
immense
heresy
in
the
middle
ages
hincmar
not
being
able
to
grapple
with
the
monk
in
argument
summoned
to
his
aid
the
brightest
intellect
of
that
century
the
first
man
who
really
gave
an
impulse
to
philosophical
inquiries
in
the
middle
ages
the
true
founder
of
scholasticism
this
man
was
john
scotus
erigena
or
john
the
who
was
also
a
monk
and
whose
early
days
had
been
spent
in
some
secluded
monastery
in
ireland
or
the
scottish
islands
somehow
he
attracted
the
attention
of
charles
the
bald
and
became
his
guest
and
chosen
companion
and
yet
while
he
lived
in
the
court
he
spent
the
most
of
his
time
in
intellectual
seclusion
as
a
guest
of
the
king
he
may
have
become
acquainted
with
hincmar
or
his
acquaintance
with
hincmar
may
have
led
to
his
friendship
with
charles
he
was
witty
bright
and
learned
like
ab√©lard
a
favorite
with
the
great
in
his
treatise
on
predestination
in
which
he
combated
the
views
of
gotschalk
he
probably
went
further
than
hincmar
desired
or
expected
he
boldly
asserted
the
supremacy
of
reason
and
threw
off
the
shackles
of
authority
he
combated
saint
augustine
as
well
as
gottschalk
he
even
aspired
to
reconcile
with
the
divine
sovereignty
the
great
mistake
of
theologians
in
every
age
the
most
hopeless
and
the
most
ambitious
effort
of
human
genius
a
problem
which
can
not
be
solved
he
went
even
further
than
this
he
attempted
to
harmonize
philosophy
with
religion
as
ab√©lard
did
afterwards
he
brought
all
theological
questions
to
the
test
of
dialectical
reasoning
thus
the
ninth
century
saw
a
rationalist
and
a
pantheist
at
the
court
of
a
christian
king
like
democritus
he
maintained
the
eternity
of
matter
like
a
buddhist
he
believed
that
god
is
all
things
and
all
things
are
god
such
doctrines
were
not
to
be
tolerated
even
in
an
age
when
theological
speculations
did
not
usually
provoke
persecution
religious
persecution
for
opinions
was
the
fruit
of
subsequent
inquiries
and
did
not
reach
its
height
until
the
dominicans
arose
in
the
thirteenth
century
but
erigena
was
generally
denounced
he
fell
under
the
censure
of
the
pope
and
was
obliged
to
fly
taking
refuge
about
the
year
in
england
it
is
said
at
oxford
where
there
was
probably
a
cathedral
school
but
not
as
yet
a
university
with
its
professors
chairs
and
scholastic
honors
others
suppose
that
he
died
in
paris
a
spirit
of
inquiry
having
been
thus
awakened
among
a
few
intellectual
monks
they
began
to
speculate
about
those
questions
which
had
agitated
the
grecian
schools
whether
and
called
universals
or
ideas
have
a
substantial
and
independent
existence
or
whether
they
are
the
creation
of
our
own
minds
whether
if
they
have
a
real
existence
they
are
material
or
immaterial
essences
whether
they
exist
apart
from
objects
perceptible
by
the
senses
it
is
singular
that
such
questions
should
have
been
discussed
in
the
ninth
century
since
neither
plato
nor
aristotle
were
studied
that
age
was
totally
ignorant
of
greek
it
may
be
doubted
whether
there
was
a
greek
scholar
in
western
europe
or
even
in
rome
no
very
remarkable
man
arose
with
a
rationalizing
spirit
after
erigena
until
berengar
of
tours
in
the
eleventh
century
who
maintained
that
in
the
sacrament
the
presence
of
the
body
of
christ
involves
no
change
in
the
nature
and
essence
of
the
bread
and
wine
he
was
opposed
by
lanfranc
but
the
doctrine
of
transubstantiation
was
too
deeply
grounded
in
the
faith
of
christendom
to
be
easily
shaken
controversies
seemed
to
centre
around
the
doctrine
of
the
real
existence
of
ideas
what
are
called
universals
which
doctrine
was
generally
accepted
the
monks
in
this
matter
followed
saint
augustine
who
was
a
realist
as
were
also
the
orthodox
leaders
of
the
church
generally
from
his
time
to
that
of
saint
bernard
it
was
a
sequence
of
the
belief
in
the
doctrine
of
the
trinity
no
one
of
mark
opposed
the
realism
which
had
now
become
one
of
the
accepted
philosophical
opinions
of
the
age
until
roscelin
in
the
latter
part
of
the
eleventh
century
denied
that
universals
have
a
real
existence
it
was
plato
doctrine
that
universals
have
an
independent
existence
apart
from
individual
objects
and
that
they
exist
before
the
latter
ante
the
thought
the
thing
while
aristotle
maintained
that
universals
though
possessing
a
real
existence
exist
only
in
individual
objects
in
the
thought
the
thing
nominalism
is
the
doctrine
that
individuals
only
have
real
existence
post
the
thought
the
thing
it
is
not
probable
that
this
profound
question
about
universals
would
have
excited
much
interest
among
the
intellectual
monks
of
the
eleventh
century
had
it
not
been
applied
to
theological
subjects
in
which
chiefly
they
were
absorbed
now
roscelin
advanced
the
doctrine
that
if
the
three
persons
in
the
trinity
were
one
thing
it
would
follow
that
the
father
and
the
holy
ghost
must
have
entered
into
the
flesh
together
with
the
son
and
as
he
believed
that
only
individuals
exist
in
reality
it
would
follow
that
the
three
persons
of
the
godhead
are
three
substances
in
fact
three
gods
thus
nominalism
logically
led
to
an
assault
on
the
received
doctrine
of
the
trinity
the
central
point
in
the
theology
of
the
church
this
was
heresy
the
foundations
of
christian
belief
were
attacked
and
no
one
in
that
age
was
strong
enough
to
come
to
the
rescue
but
anselm
then
abbot
of
bec
his
great
service
to
the
cause
of
christian
theology
and
therefore
to
the
church
universal
was
his
exposition
of
the
logical
results
of
the
nominalism
of
roscelin
to
whom
universals
or
ideas
were
merely
creations
of
the
mind
or
conventional
phrases
having
no
real
existence
hence
such
things
as
love
friendship
beauty
justice
were
only
conceptions
plato
and
augustine
maintained
that
they
are
eternal
verities
not
to
be
explained
by
definitions
appealing
to
consciousness
in
the
firm
belief
in
which
the
soul
sustains
itself
that
there
can
be
no
certain
knowledge
without
a
recognition
of
these
that
from
these
only
sound
deductions
of
moral
truth
can
be
drawn
that
without
a
firm
belief
in
these
eternal
certitudes
there
can
be
no
repose
and
no
lofty
faith
these
ideas
are
independent
of
us
they
do
not
vary
with
our
changing
sensations
they
have
nothing
to
do
with
sensation
they
are
not
creations
of
the
brain
they
inherently
exist
from
all
eternity
the
substance
of
these
ideas
is
god
without
these
we
could
not
conceive
of
god
augustine
especially
in
the
true
spirit
of
platonism
abhorred
doctrines
which
made
the
existence
of
god
depend
upon
our
own
abstractions
to
him
there
was
a
reality
in
love
in
friendship
in
justice
in
beauty
and
he
repelled
scepticism
as
to
their
eternal
existence
as
life
repels
death
roscelin
took
away
the
platform
from
whose
lofty
heights
socrates
and
plato
would
survey
the
universe
he
attacked
the
citadel
in
which
augustine
intrenched
himself
amid
the
desolations
of
a
dissolving
world
he
laid
the
axe
at
the
root
of
the
tree
which
sheltered
all
those
who
would
fly
from
uncertainty
and
despair
but
if
these
ideas
were
not
true
what
was
true
on
what
were
the
hopes
of
the
world
to
be
based
where
was
consolation
for
the
miseries
of
life
to
be
found
there
are
many
goods
says
anselm
which
we
desire
some
for
utility
and
others
for
beauty
but
all
these
goods
are
relative
more
or
less
good
and
imply
something
absolutely
good
this
absolute
good
the
is
god
in
like
manner
all
that
is
great
and
high
are
only
relatively
great
and
high
and
hence
there
must
be
something
absolutely
great
and
high
and
this
is
god
there
must
exist
at
least
one
being
than
which
no
other
is
higher
hence
there
must
be
but
one
such
being
and
this
is
god
it
was
thus
that
anselm
brought
philosophy
to
the
support
of
theology
he
would
combat
the
philosophical
reasonings
of
roscelin
with
still
keener
dialectics
he
would
conquer
him
on
his
own
ground
and
with
his
own
weapons
let
it
not
be
supposed
that
this
controversy
about
universals
was
a
mere
dialectical
tournament
with
no
grand
results
it
goes
down
to
the
root
of
almost
every
great
subject
in
philosophy
and
religion
the
denial
of
universal
ideas
is
rationalism
and
materialism
in
philosophy
as
it
is
pelagianism
and
arminianism
in
theology
the
nominalism
of
roscelin
reappeared
in
the
rationalism
of
ab√©lard
and
carried
out
to
its
severe
logical
sequences
is
the
refusal
to
accept
any
doctrine
which
can
not
be
proved
by
reason
hence
nothing
is
to
be
accepted
which
is
beyond
the
province
of
reason
to
explain
and
hence
nothing
is
to
be
received
by
faith
alone
christianity
in
the
hands
of
fearless
and
logical
nominalists
would
melt
away
that
is
what
is
peculiar
in
its
mysterious
dogmas
its
mysterious
dogmas
were
the
anchors
of
belief
in
ages
of
faith
it
was
these
which
animated
the
existence
of
such
men
as
augustine
bernard
anselm
and
thomas
aquinas
hence
their
terrible
antagonism
even
to
philosophical
doctrines
which
conflicted
with
the
orthodox
belief
on
which
as
they
thought
the
salvation
of
mankind
rested
but
anselm
did
not
rest
with
combating
the
nominalism
of
roscelin
in
the
course
of
his
inquiries
and
arguments
he
felt
it
necessary
to
establish
the
belief
in
god
the
one
great
thing
from
which
all
other
questions
radiated
by
a
new
argument
and
on
firmer
ground
than
that
on
which
it
had
hitherto
rested
he
was
profoundly
devotional
as
well
as
logical
and
original
as
he
was
learned
beyond
all
the
monks
of
his
age
he
lived
in
the
contemplation
of
god
god
was
to
him
the
essence
of
all
good
the
end
of
all
inquiries
the
joy
and
repose
of
his
soul
he
could
not
understand
unless
he
believed
knowledge
was
the
of
faith
not
its
the
idea
of
god
in
the
mind
of
man
is
the
highest
proof
of
the
existence
of
god
that
only
is
real
which
appeals
to
consciousness
he
did
not
care
to
reason
about
a
thing
when
reasoning
would
not
strengthen
his
convictions
perhaps
involve
him
in
doubts
and
perplexities
reason
is
finite
and
clouded
and
warped
but
that
which
directly
appeals
to
consciousness
as
all
that
is
eternal
must
appeal
and
to
that
alone
like
beauty
and
justice
and
love
ultimate
ideas
to
which
reasoning
and
definitions
add
nothing
is
to
be
received
as
a
final
certitude
hence
absolute
certainty
of
the
existence
of
god
as
it
appeals
to
consciousness
like
the
ergo
in
this
argument
he
anticipated
descartes
and
proved
himself
the
profoundest
thinker
of
his
century
perhaps
of
five
centuries
the
deductions
which
anselm
made
from
the
attributes
of
god
and
his
moral
government
seem
to
have
strengthened
the
belief
of
the
middle
ages
in
some
theological
aspects
which
are
repulsive
to
consciousness
his
stronghold
thereby
showing
how
any
deductions
are
apt
to
be
when
pushed
out
to
their
utmost
logical
consequences
how
they
may
even
become
a
rebuke
to
human
reason
in
those
grand
efforts
of
which
reason
is
most
proud
for
theology
it
must
be
borne
in
mind
is
a
science
of
deductions
from
acknowledged
truths
of
revelation
hence
from
the
imperfections
of
reason
or
from
disregard
of
other
established
truths
deductions
may
be
pushed
to
absurdity
even
when
logical
and
may
be
made
to
conflict
with
the
obvious
meaning
of
primal
truths
from
which
these
deductions
are
made
or
at
least
with
those
intuitions
which
are
hard
to
be
distinguished
from
consciousness
itself
there
may
be
no
flaw
in
the
argument
but
the
argument
may
land
one
in
absurdity
and
contradiction
for
instance
from
the
acknowledged
sinfulness
of
human
nature
one
of
the
cardinal
declarations
of
scripture
and
confirmed
by
universal
experience
and
the
equally
fundamental
truth
that
god
is
infinite
anselm
assumed
the
dogma
that
the
guilt
of
men
as
sinners
against
an
infinite
god
is
infinitely
great
from
this
premise
which
few
in
his
age
were
disposed
to
deny
for
it
was
in
accordance
with
saint
augustine
it
follows
that
infinite
sin
according
to
eternal
justice
could
only
be
atoned
for
by
an
infinite
punishment
hence
all
men
deserve
eternal
punishment
and
must
receive
it
unless
there
be
made
an
infinite
satisfaction
or
atonement
since
not
otherwise
can
divine
love
be
harmonized
with
divine
justice
hence
it
was
necessary
that
the
eternal
son
should
become
man
and
make
by
his
voluntary
death
on
the
cross
the
necessary
atonement
for
human
sins
pushed
out
to
the
severest
logical
consequences
it
would
follow
that
as
an
infinite
satisfaction
has
atoned
for
sin
sinners
are
pardoned
but
the
church
shrank
from
such
a
conclusion
although
logical
and
included
in
the
benefits
of
the
atonement
only
the
portion
of
mankind
the
discrepancy
between
the
logical
deductions
and
consciousness
and
i
may
add
scripture
lies
in
assuming
that
human
guilt
great
it
is
thus
that
theology
became
complicated
even
gloomy
and
in
some
points
false
by
metaphysical
reasonings
which
had
such
a
charm
both
to
the
fathers
and
the
schoolmen
the
attempt
to
reconcile
divine
justice
with
divine
love
by
metaphysics
and
abstruse
reasoning
proved
as
futile
as
the
attempt
to
reconcile
with
predestination
for
divine
justice
was
made
by
deduction
without
reference
to
other
attributes
to
conflict
with
those
ideas
of
justice
which
consciousness
attests
even
as
a
fettered
will
of
which
all
are
conscious
that
is
a
will
fettered
by
sin
was
pushed
out
by
logical
deductions
into
absolute
slavery
and
impotence
anselm
did
not
carry
out
metaphysical
reasonings
to
such
lengths
as
did
the
schoolmen
who
succeeded
him
those
dialecticians
who
lived
in
universities
in
the
thirteenth
century
he
was
a
devout
man
who
meditated
on
god
and
on
revealed
truth
with
awe
and
reverence
without
any
desire
of
or
dialectical
victories
this
desire
more
properly
marked
the
scholastic
doctors
of
the
universities
in
a
subsequent
age
when
though
philosophy
had
been
invoked
by
anselm
to
support
theology
they
virtually
made
theology
subordinate
to
philosophy
it
was
his
main
effort
to
establish
on
rational
grounds
the
existence
of
god
and
afterwards
the
doctrines
of
the
trinity
and
the
incarnation
and
yet
with
anselm
and
roscelin
the
scholastic
age
began
they
were
the
founders
of
the
realists
and
the
nominalists
those
two
schools
which
divided
the
church
in
the
twelfth
and
thirteenth
centuries
and
which
will
probably
go
on
together
under
different
names
as
long
as
men
shall
believe
and
doubt
but
this
subject
on
which

article

in

thomas
aquinas
the
scholastic
philosophy
we
have
seen
how
the
cloister
life
of
the
middle
ages
developed
meditative
habits
of
mind
which
were
followed
by
a
spirit
of
inquiry
on
deep
theological
questions
we
have
now
to
consider
a
great
intellectual
movement
stimulated
by
the
effort
to
bring
philosophy
to
the
aid
of
theology
and
thus
more
effectually
to
battle
with
insidious
and
rising
heresies
the
most
illustrious
representative
of
this
movement
was
thomas
of
aquino
generally
called
thomas
aquinas
with
him
we
associate
the
scholastic
philosophy
which
though
barren
in
the
results
at
which
it
aimed
led
to
a
remarkable
intellectual
activity
and
hence
indirectly
to
the
emancipation
of
the
mind
it
furnished
teachers
who
prepared
the
way
for
the
great
lights
of
the
reformation
anselm
had
successfully
battled
with
the
rationalism
of
roscelin
and
also
had
furnished
a
new
argument
for
the
existence
of
god
he
secured
the
triumph
of
realism
for
a
time
and
the
apparent
extinction
of
heresy
but
a
new
impulse
to
thought
was
given
soon
after
his
death
by
a
less
profound
but
more
popular
and
brilliant
man
and
like
him
a
monk
this
was
the
celebrated
peter
ab√©lard
born
in
the
year
in
brittany
of
noble
parents
and
a
boy
of
remarkable
precocity
he
was
a
sort
of
of
philosophy
going
from
convent
to
convent
and
from
school
to
school
disputing
while
a
mere
youth
with
learned
teachers
wherever
he
could
find
them
having
vanquished
the
masters
in
the
provincial
schools
he
turned
his
steps
to
paris
at
that
time
the
intellectual
centre
of
europe
the
university
was
not
yet
established
but
the
cathedral
school
of
notre
dame
was
presided
over
by
william
of
champeaux
who
defended
the
realism
of
anselm
to
this
famous
cathedral
school
ab√©lard
came
as
a
pupil
of
the
veteran
dialectician
at
the
age
of
twenty
and
dared
to
dispute
his
doctrines
he
soon
set
up
as
a
teacher
himself
but
as
notre
dame
was
interdicted
to
him
he
retired
to
melun
ten
leagues
from
paris
where
enthusiastic
pupils
crowded
to
his
lecture
room
for
he
was
witty
bold
sarcastic
acute
and
eloquent
he
afterwards
removed
to
paris
and
so
completely
discomfited
his
old
master
that
he
retired
from
the
field
ab√©lard
then
applied
himself
to
the
study
of
divinity
and
attended
the
lectures
of
anselm
of
laon
who
though
an
old
man
was
treated
by
ab√©lard
with
great
flippancy
and
arrogance
he
then
began
to
lecture
on
divinity
as
well
as
philosophy
with
extraordinary
students
flocked
to
his
lecture
room
from
all
parts
of
germany
italy
france
and
england
it
is
said
that
five
thousand
young
men
attended
his
lectures
among
whom
one
hundred
were
destined
to
be
prelates
including
that
brilliant
and
able
italian
who
afterwards
reigned
as
innocent
iii
it
was
about
this
time
when
he
was
that
he
encountered
h√©lo√Øse
a
passage
of
his
life
which
will
be
considered
in
a
later
volume
of
this
work
his
unfortunate
love
and
his
cruel
misfortune
led
to
a
temporary
seclusion
in
a
convent
from
which
however
he
issued
to
lecture
with
renewed
popularity
in
a
desert
place
in
champagne
where
he
constructed
a
vast
edifice
and
dedicated
it
to
the
paraclete
it
was
here
that
his
most
brilliant
days
were
spent
it
is
said
that
three
thousand
pupils
followed
him
to
this
wilderness
he
was
doubtless
the
most
brilliant
and
successful
lecturer
that
the
middle
ages
ever
saw
he
continued
the
controversy
which
was
begun
by
roscelin
respecting
universals
the
reality
of
which
he
denied
ab√©lard
was
not
acquainted
with
the
greek
but
in
a
latin
translation
from
the
arabic
he
had
studied
aristotle
whom
he
regarded
as
the
great
master
of
dialectics
although
not
making
use
of
his
method
as
did
the
great
scholastics
of
the
succeeding
century
still
he
was
among
the
first
to
apply
dialectics
to
theology
he
maintained
a
certain
independence
of
the
patristic
authority
by
his
sic
et
non
in
which
treatise
he
makes
the
authorities
neutralize
each
other
by
placing
side
by
side
contradictory
assertions
he
maintained
that
the
natural
propensity
to
evil
in
consequence
of
the
original
transgression
is
not
in
itself
sin
that
sin
consists
in
consenting
to
evil
it
is
not
said
he
the
temptation
to
lust
that
is
sinful
but
the
acquiescence
in
the
temptation
hence
that
virtue
can
not
be
tested
without
temptations
consequently
that
moral
worth
can
only
be
truly
estimated
by
god
to
whom
motives
are
known
in
short
that
sin
consists
in
the
intention
and
not
in
act
he
admitted
with
anselm
that
faith
in
a
certain
sense
precedes
knowledge
but
insisted
that
one
must
know
why
and
what
he
believes
before
his
faith
is
established
hence
that
faith
works
itself
out
of
doubt
by
means
of
rational
investigation
the
tendency
of
ab√©lard
teachings
was
rationalistic
and
therefore
he
arrayed
against
himself
the
great
champion
of
orthodoxy
in
his
day
saint
bernard
abbot
of
clairvaux
the
most
influential
churchman
of
his
age
and
the
most
devout
and
lofty
his
immense
influence
was
based
on
his
learning
and
sanctity
but
he
was
dogmatic
and
intolerant
it
is
probable
that
the
intellectual
arrogance
of
ab√©lard
his
flippancy
and
his
sarcasms
offended
more
than
the
matter
of
his
lectures
it
is
not
by
industry
said
he
that
i
have
reached
the
heights
of
philosophy
but
by
force
of
genius
he
was
more
admired
by
young
and
worldly
men
than
by
old
men
he
was
the
admiration
of
women
for
he
was
poet
as
well
as
philosopher
his
were
scattered
over
europe
with
a
proud
and
aristocratic
bearing
severe
yet
negligent
dress
beautiful
and
noble
figure
musical
and
electrical
voice
added
to
the
impression
he
made
by
his
wit
and
dialectical
power
no
man
ever
commanded
greater
admiration
from
those
who
listened
to
him
but
he
excited
envy
as
well
as
admiration
and
was
probably
misrepresented
by
his
opponents
like
all
strong
and
original
characters
he
had
bitter
enemies
as
well
as
admiring
friends
and
these
enemies
exaggerated
his
failings
and
his
heretical
opinions
therefore
he
was
summoned
before
the
council
of
soissons
and
condemned
to
perpetual
silence
from
this
he
appealed
to
rome
and
rome
sided
with
his
enemies
he
found
a
retreat
after
his
condemnation
in
the
abbey
of
cluny
and
died
in
the
arms
of
his
friend
peter
the
venerable
the
most
benignant
ecclesiastic
of
the
century
who
venerated
his
genius
and
defended
his
orthodoxy
and
whose
influence
procured
him
absolution
from
the
pope
but
whatever
were
the
faults
of
ab√©lard
however
selfish
he
was
in
his
treatment
of
h√©lo√Øse
or
proud
and
provoking
to
adversaries
or
even
heretical
in
many
of
his
doctrines
especially
in
reference
to
faith
which
he
is
accused
of
undermining
although
he
accepted
in
the
main
the
received
doctrines
of
the
church
certainly
in
his
latter
days
when
he
was
broken
and
penitent
for
no
great
man
ever
suffered
more
humiliating
misfortunes
one
thing
is
clear
that
he
gave
a
stimulus
to
philosophical
inquiries
and
awakened
a
desire
of
knowledge
and
gave
dignity
to
human
reason
beyond
any
man
in
the
middle
ages
the
dialectical
and
controversial
spirit
awakened
by
ab√©lard
led
to
such
a
variety
of
opinions
among
the
inquiring
young
men
who
assembled
in
paris
at
the
various
schools
some
of
which
were
regarded
as
rationalistic
in
their
tendency
or
at
least
a
departure
from
the
patristic
standard
that
peter
lombard
bishop
of
paris
collected
in
four
books
the
various
sayings
of
the
fathers
concerning
theological
dogmas
he
was
also
influenced
to
make
this
exposition
by
the
sic
et
non
of
ab√©lard
which
tended
to
unsettle
belief
this
famous
manual
called
the
book
of
sentences
appeared
about
the
middle
of
the
twelfth
century
and
had
an
immense
influence
it
was
the
great
of
the
theological
schools
about
the
time
this
book
appeared
the
works
of
aristotle
were
introduced
to
the
attention
of
students
translated
into
latin
from
the
saracenic
language
aristotle
had
already
been
commented
upon
by
arabian
scholars
in
spain
among
whom
averroes
a
physician
and
mathematician
of
cordova
was
the
most
distinguished
who
regarded
the
greek
philosopher
as
the
founder
of
scientific
knowledge
his
works
were
translated
from
the
greek
into
the
arabic
in
the
early
part
of
the
ninth
century
the
introduction
of
aristotle
led
to
an
extension
of
philosophical
studies
from
the
time
of
charlemagne
only
grammar
and
elementary
logic
and
dogmatic
theology
had
been
taught
but
ab√©lard
introduced
dialectics
into
theology
a
more
complete
method
was
required
than
that
which
the
existing
schools
furnished
and
this
was
supplied
by
the
dialectics
of
aristotle
he
became
therefore
at
the
close
of
the
twelfth
century
an
acknowledged
authority
and
his
method
was
adopted
to
support
the
dogmas
of
the
church
meanwhile
the
press
of
students
at
paris
collected
into
various
schools
the
chief
of
which
were
the
theological
school
of
notre
dame
and
the
school
of
logic
at
mount
genevi√®ve
where
ab√©lard
had
lectured
demanded
a
new
organization
the
teachers
and
pupils
of
these
schools
then
formed
a
corporation
called
a
university
magistrorum
et
under
the
control
of
the
chancellor
and
chapter
of
notre
dame
whose
corporate
existence
was
secured
from
innocent
iii
a
few
years
afterwards
thus
arose
the
university
of
paris
at
the
close
of
the
twelfth
century
or
about
the
beginning
of
the
thirteenth
soon
followed
in
different
parts
of
europe
by
other
universities
the
most
distinguished
of
which
were
those
of
oxford
bologna
padua
and
salamanca
but
that
of
paris
took
the
lead
this
city
being
the
intellectual
centre
of
europe
even
at
that
early
day
thither
flocked
young
men
from
germany
england
and
italy
as
well
as
from
all
parts
of
france
to
the
number
of
or
thirty
thousand
these
students
were
a
motley
crowd
some
of
them
were
youth
with
tattered
clothes
living
in
garrets
and
unhealthy
cells
others
again
were
rich
and
noble
but
all
were
eager
for
knowledge
they
came
to
paris
as
pilgrims
flocked
to
jerusalem
being
drawn
by
the
fame
of
the
lecturers
the
old
sleepy
schools
of
the
convents
were
deserted
for
who
would
go
to
fulda
or
york
or
citeaux
when
such
men
as
ab√©lard
albert
and
victor
were
dazzling
enthusiastic
youth
by
their
brilliant
disputations
these
young
men
also
seem
to
have
been
noisy
turbulent
and
dissipated
for
the
most
part
filling
the
streets
with
their
brawls
and
the
taverns
with
the
fumes
of
liquor
there
was
no
such
thing
as
discipline
among
them
they
yelled
and
shouted
and
brandished
daggers
fought
the
townspeople
and
were
free
with
their
knocks
and
blows
they
were
not
all
youth
many
of
them
were
men
in
middle
life
with
wives
and
children
at
that
time
no
one
finished
his
education
at
some
remained
scholars
until
the
age
of
some
of
these
students
came
to
study
medicine
others
law
but
more
theology
and
philosophy
the
headquarters
of
theology
was
the
sorbonne
opened
in
a
college
founded
by
robert
sorbon
chaplain
of
the
king
whose
aim
was
to
bring
together
the
students
and
professors
heretofore
scattered
throughout
the
city
the
students
of
this
college
which
formed
a
part
of
the
university
under
the
rule
of
the
chancellor
of
notre
dame
it
would
seem
were
more
orderly
and
studious
than
the
other
students
they
arose
at
five
assisted
at
mass
at
six
studied
till
ten
the
dinner
hour
from
dinner
till
five
they
studied
or
attended
lectures
then
went
to
supper
the
principal
meal
after
which
they
discussed
problems
till
nine
or
ten
when
they
went
to
bed
the
students
were
divided
into
and
the
latter
of
whom
carried
on
the
administration
the
lectures
were
given
in
a
large
hall
in
the
middle
of
which
was
the
chair
of
the
master
or
doctor
while
immediately
below
him
sat
his
assistant
the
bachelor
who
was
going
through
his
training
for
a
professorship
the
chair
of
theology
was
the
most
coveted
honor
of
the
university
and
was
reached
only
by
a
long
course
of
study
and
searching
examinations
to
which
no
one
could
aspire
but
the
most
learned
and
gifted
of
the
doctors
the
students
sat
around
on
benches
or
on
the
straw
there
were
no
the
teaching
was
oral
principally
by
questions
and
answers
neither
the
master
nor
the
bachelor
used
a
book
no
reading
was
allowed
the
students
rarely
took
notes
or
wrote
in
they
listened
to
the
lectures
and
wrote
them
down
afterwards
so
far
as
their
memory
served
them
the
usual
was
the
book
of
sentences
by
peter
lombard
the
bachelor
after
having
previously
studied
ten
years
was
obliged
to
go
through
a
three
years
drill
and
then
submit
to
a
public
examination
in
presence
of
the
whole
university
before
he
was
thought
fit
to
teach
he
could
not
then
receive
his
master
badge
until
he
had
successfully
maintained
a
public
disputation
on
some
thesis
proposed
and
even
then
he
stood
no
chance
of
being
elevated
to
a
professor
chair
unless
he
had
lectured
for
some
time
with
great
even
albertus
magnus
fresh
with
the
laurels
of
cologne
was
compelled
to
go
through
a
three
years
course
as
a
at
paris
before
he
received
his
cap
and
to
lecture
for
some
years
more
as
master
before
his
transcendent
abilities
were
rewarded
with
a
professorship
the
dean
of
the
faculty
of
theology
was
chosen
by
the
suffrages
of
the
doctors
the
philosophy
of
first
principles
of
aristotle
was
first
publicly
taught
in
this
was
certainly
in
advance
of
the
seven
liberal
arts
which
were
studied
in
the
old
cathedral
schools
grammar
rhetoric
and
dialectic
trivium
and
arithmetic
geometry
music
and
astronomy
quadrivium
for
only
the
elements
of
these
were
taught
but
philosophy
and
theology
under
the
teaching
of
the
scholastic
doctors
taxed
severely
the
intellectual
powers
when
they
introduced
dialectics
to
support
theology
a
more
severe
method
was
required
the
method
consisted
in
connecting
the
doctrine
to
be
expounded
with
a
commentary
on
some
work
chosen
for
the
purpose
the
contents
were
divided
and
subdivided
until
the
several
propositions
of
which
it
was
composed
were
reached
then
these
were
interpreted
questions
were
raised
in
reference
to
them
and
the
grounds
of
affirming
or
denying
were
presented
then
the
decision
was
announced
and
in
case
this
was
affirmative
the
grounds
of
the
negative
were
confuted
aristotle
was
made
use
of
in
order
to
reduce
to
scientific
form
a
body
of
dogmatic
teachings
or
to
introduce
a
logical
arrangement
platonism
embraced
by
the
early
fathers
was
a
collection
of
abstractions
and
theories
but
was
deficient
in
method
it
did
not
furnish
the
weapons
to
assail
heresy
with
effect
but
aristotle
was
logical
and
precise
and
passionless
he
examined
the
nature
of
language
and
was
clear
and
accurate
in
his
definitions
his
logic
was
studied
with
the
sole
view
of
learning
to
use
polemical
weapons
for
this
end
the
syllogism
was
introduced
which
descends
from
the
universal
to
the
particular
by
deduction
connecting
the
general
with
the
special
by
means
of
a
middle
term
which
is
common
to
both
this
mode
of
reasoning
is
opposite
to
the
method
by
induction
which
rises
to
the
universal
from
a
comparison
of
the
single
and
particular
or
as
applied
in
science
from
a
collection
and
collation
of
facts
sufficient
to
form
a
certainty
or
high
probability
a
sound
special
deduction
can
be
arrived
at
only
by
logical
inference
from
true
and
certain
general
principles
this
is
what
anselm
essayed
to
do
but
the
schoolmen
who
succeeded
ab√©lard
often
drew
dialectical
inferences
from
what
appeared
to
be
true
while
some
of
them
were
so
sophistical
as
to
argue
from
false
premises
this
syllogistic
reasoning
in
the
hands
of
an
acute
dialectician
was
very
efficient
in
overthrowing
an
antagonist
or
turning
his
position
into
absurdity
but
not
favorable
for
the
discovery
of
truth
since
it
aimed
no
higher
than
the
establishment
of
the
particulars
which
were
included
in
the
doctrine
assumed
or
deduced
from
it
it
was
reasoning
in
perpetual
circles
it
was
full
of
quibbles
and
sophistries
it
was
ingenious
subtle
acute
very
attractive
to
the
minds
of
that
age
and
inexhaustible
from
divisions
and
subdivisions
and
endless
ramifications
it
made
the
contests
of
the
schools
a
dialectical
display
of
remarkable
powers
in
which
great
interest
was
felt
yet
but
little
knowledge
was
acquired
in
one
respect
the
scholastic
doctors
rendered
a
service
they
demolished
all
dreamy
theories
and
poured
contempt
on
mystical
phrases
they
insisted
like
socrates
on
a
definite
meaning
to
words
if
they
were
in
their
definitions
and
distinctions
they
were
at
least
clear
and
precise
their
method
was
scientific
such
terms
and
expressions
as
are
frequently
used
by
our
modern
transcendental
philosophers
would
have
been
laughed
to
scorn
by
the
schoolmen
no
system
of
philosophy
can
be
built
up
when
words
have
no
definite
meaning
this
socrates
was
the
first
to
inculcate
and
aristotle
followed
in
his
steps
with
the
crusades
arose
a
new
spirit
which
gave
an
impulse
to
philosophy
as
well
as
to
art
and
enterprise
the
of
the
new
system
was
motion
in
distinction
from
the
rest
which
marked
the
old
monastic
retreats
an
immense
enthusiasm
for
knowledge
had
been
kindled
by
ab√©lard
which
was
further
intensified
by
the
scholastic
doctors
of
the
thirteenth
century
especially
such
of
them
as
belonged
to
the
dominican
and
franciscan
friars
these
celebrated
orders
arose
at
a
great
crisis
in
the
papal
history
when
rival
popes
aspired
to
the
throne
of
saint
peter
when
the
church
was
rent
with
divisions
when
princes
were
contending
for
the
right
of
investiture
and
when
heretical
opinions
were
defended
by
men
of
genius
at
this
crisis
a
great
pope
was
called
to
the
government
of
the
church
innocent
under
whose
able
rule
the
papal
power
culminated
he
belonged
to
an
illustrious
roman
family
and
received
an
unusual
education
being
versed
in
theology
philosophy
and
canon
law
his
name
was
lothario
of
the
family
of
the
conti
he
was
nephew
of
a
pope
and
counted
three
cardinals
among
his
relatives
at
the
age
of
about
the
year
he
was
one
of
the
canons
of
saint
peter
church
at
he
was
sent
by
the
pope
on
important
missions
in
he
was
created
cardinal
by
his
uncle
clement
iii
and
in
he
was
elected
pope
at
the
age
of
when
the
crusades
were
at
their
height
when
the
south
of
france
was
agitated
by
the
opinions
of
the
albigenses
and
the
provinces
on
the
rhine
by
those
of
the
waldenses
it
was
a
turbulent
age
full
of
tumults
insurrections
wars
and
theological
dissensions
the
old
benedictine
monks
had
lost
their
influence
and
were
disgraced
by
idleness
and
gluttony
while
the
secular
clergy
were
ignorant
and
worldly
innocent
cast
his
eagle
eye
into
all
the
abuses
which
disgraced
the
age
and
church
and
made
fearless
war
upon
those
princes
who
usurped
his
prerogatives
he
excommunicated
princes
humbled
the
emperor
of
germany
and
the
king
of
england
put
kingdoms
under
interdict
exempted
abbots
from
the
jurisdiction
of
bishops
punished
heretics
formed
crusades
laid
down
new
canons
regulated
taxes
and
directed
all
ecclesiastical
movements
his
activity
was
ceaseless
and
his
ambition
was
boundless
he
instituted
important
changes
and
added
new
orders
of
monks
to
the
church
it
was
this
pope
who
instituted
auricular
confession
and
laid
the
foundation
of
a
more
dreadful
spiritual
despotism
in
the
form
of
inquisitions
yet
while
he
ruled
tyrannically
his
private
life
was
above
reproach
his
habits
were
simple
and
his
tastes
were
cultivated
he
was
charitable
and
kind
to
the
poor
and
unfortunate
he
spent
his
enormous
revenues
in
building
churches
endowing
hospitals
and
rewarding
learned
men
and
otherwise
showed
himself
the
friend
of
scholars
and
the
patron
of
benevolent
movements
he
was
a
reformer
of
abuses
publishing
the
most
severe
acts
against
venality
and
deciding
quarrels
on
principles
of
justice
he
had
no
dramatic
conflicts
like
hildebrand
for
his
authority
was
established
as
the
supreme
guardian
of
the
interests
of
the
church
he
seldom
made
demands
which
he
had
not
the
power
to
enforce
john
of
england
attempted
resistance
but
was
compelled
to
submit
innocent
even
gave
the
archbishopric
of
canterbury
to
one
of
his
cardinals
stephen
langton
against
the
wishes
of
a
norman
king
he
took
away
the
wife
of
philip
augustus
he
nominated
an
emperor
to
the
throne
of
constantine
he
compelled
france
to
make
war
on
england
and
incited
the
barons
to
rebellion
against
john
ten
years
civil
war
in
germany
was
the
fruit
of
his
astute
policy
and
the
only
great
failure
of
his
administration
was
that
he
could
not
exempt
italy
from
the
dominion
of
the
emperors
of
germany
thus
giving
rise
to
the
two
great
political
parties
of
the
thirteenth
and
fourteenth
centuries
the
guelphs
and
ghibellines
to
cement
his
vast
spiritual
power
he
encouraged
what
doubtless
seemed
even
to
him
a
great
fanaticism
but
which
he
found
could
be
turned
to
his
advantage
that
of
the
mendicant
friars
established
by
saint
francis
of
assisi
and
saint
dominic
of
the
great
family
of
the
guzmans
in
spain
these
men
made
substantially
the
same
offers
to
the
pope
that
ignatius
loyola
did
in
after
times
to
go
where
they
were
sent
as
teachers
preachers
and
missionaries
without
condition
or
reward
they
renounced
riches
professed
absolute
poverty
and
wandered
from
village
to
city
barefooted
and
subsisting
entirely
on
alms
as
beggars
the
dominican
friar
in
his
black
habit
and
the
franciscan
in
his
gray
became
the
ablest
and
most
effective
preachers
of
the
thirteenth
century
the
dominicans
confined
their
teachings
to
the
upper
classes
and
became
their
favorite
confessors
they
were
the
most
learned
men
of
the
thirteenth
century
and
also
the
most
reproachless
in
morals
the
franciscans
were
itinerary
preachers
to
the
common
people
and
created
among
them
the
same
religious
revival
that
the
methodists
did
later
in
england
under
the
guidance
of
wesley
the
founder
of
the
franciscans
was
a
man
who
seemed
to
be
inebriated
with
love
so
unquenchable
was
his
charity
rapt
his
devotions
and
supernal
his
sympathy
he
found
his
way
to
rome
in
the
year
and
in
years
after
his
death
there
were
nine
thousand
religious
houses
of
his
order
in
a
century
from
his
death
the
friars
numbered
one
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
the
increase
of
the
dominicans
was
not
so
rapid
but
more
illustrious
men
belonged
to
this
institution
it
is
affirmed
that
it
produced
seventy
cardinals
four
hundred
and
sixty
bishops
and
four
popes
it
was
in
the
palmy
days
of
these
celebrated
monks
before
corruption
had
set
in
that
the
dominican
order
was
recruited
with
one
of
the
most
extraordinary
men
of
the
middle
ages
this
man
was
saint
thomas
born
or
son
of
a
count
of
aquino
in
the
kingdom
of
naples
known
in
history
as
thomas
aquinas
the
most
successful
organizer
of
knowledge
says
archbishop
trench
the
world
has
known
since
aristotle
he
was
called
the
angelical
doctor
exciting
the
enthusiasm
of
his
age
for
his
learning
and
piety
and
genius
alike
he
was
a
prodigy
and
a
marvel
of
dialectical
skill
and
catholic
writers
have
exhausted
language
to
find
expressions
for
their
admiration
their
lives
of
him
are
an
unbounded
panegyric
for
the
sweetness
of
his
temper
his
wonderful
his
lofty
devotion
to
study
his
indifference
to
praises
and
rewards
his
spiritual
devotion
his
loyalty
to
the
church
his
marvellous
acuteness
of
intellect
his
industry
and
his
unparalleled
logical
victories
when
he
was
five
years
of
age
his
father
a
noble
of
very
high
rank
sent
him
to
monte
cassino
with
the
hope
that
he
would
become
a
benedictine
monk
and
ultimately
abbot
of
that
famous
monastery
with
the
control
of
its
vast
revenues
and
patronage
here
he
remained
seven
years
until
the
convent
was
taken
and
sacked
by
the
soldiers
of
the
emperor
frederic
in
his
war
with
the
pope
the
young
aquino
returned
to
his
father
castle
and
was
then
sent
to
naples
to
be
educated
at
the
university
living
in
a
benedictine
abbey
and
not
in
lodgings
like
other
students
the
dominicans
and
franciscans
held
chairs
in
the
university
one
of
which
was
filled
with
a
man
of
great
ability
whose
preaching
and
teaching
had
such
great
influence
on
the
youthful
thomas
that
he
resolved
to
join
the
order
and
at
the
age
of
seventeen
became
a
dominican
friar
to
the
disappointment
of
his
family
his
mother
theodora
went
to
naples
to
extricate
him
from
the
hands
of
the
dominicans
who
secretly
hurried
him
off
to
rome
and
immured
him
in
their
convent
from
which
he
was
rescued
by
violence
but
the
youth
persisted
in
his
intentions
against
the
most
passionate
entreaties
of
his
mother
made
his
escape
and
was
carried
back
to
naples
the
pope
at
the
solicitation
of
his
family
offered
to
make
him
abbot
of
monte
cassino
but
he
remained
a
poor
dominican
his
superior
seeing
his
remarkable
talents
sent
him
to
cologne
to
attend
the
lectures
of
albertus
magnus
then
the
most
able
expounder
of
the
scholastic
philosophy
and
the
oracle
of
the
universities
who
continued
his
lectures
after
he
was
made
a
bishop
and
even
until
he
was
when
albertus
was
transferred
from
cologne
to
paris
where
the
dominicans
held
two
chairs
of
theology
thomas
followed
him
and
soon
after
was
made
bachelor
again
was
albert
sent
back
to
cologne
and
thomas
was
made
his
assistant
professor
he
at
once
attracted
attention
was
ordained
priest
and
became
as
famous
for
his
sermons
as
for
his
lectures
after
four
years
at
cologne
thomas
was
ordered
back
to
paris
travelling
on
foot
and
begging
his
way
yet
stopping
to
preach
in
the
large
cities
he
was
still
magister
and
albert
professor
but
had
greatly
distinguished
himself
by
his
lectures
his
appearance
at
this
time
was
marked
his
body
was
tall
and
massive
but
spare
and
lean
from
fasting
and
labor
his
eyes
were
bright
but
their
expression
was
most
modest
his
face
was
oblong
his
complexion
sallow
his
forehead
depressed
his
head
large
his
person
erect
his
first
great
work
was
a
commentary
of
about
twelve
hundred
pages
on
the
book
of
sentences
in
the
parma
edition
which
was
received
with
great
admiration
for
its
logical
precision
and
its
opposition
to
the
rationalistic
tendencies
of
the
times
in
it
are
discussed
all
the
great
theological
questions
treated
by
saint
augustine
god
christ
the
holy
spirit
grace
predestination
faith
providence
and
the
like
blended
with
metaphysical
discussions
on
the
soul
the
existence
of
evil
the
nature
of
angels
and
other
subjects
which
interested
the
middle
ages
such
was
his
fame
and
dialectical
skill
that
he
was
taken
away
from
his
teachings
and
sent
to
rome
to
defend
his
order
and
the
cause
of
orthodoxy
against
the
slanders
of
william
of
saint
amour
an
aristocratic
doctor
who
hated
the
mendicant
friars
and
their
wandering
and
begging
habits
william
had
written
a
book
called
perils
in
which
he
exposed
the
dangers
to
be
apprehended
from
the
new
order
of
monks
in
which
he
proved
himself
a
true
prophet
for
ultimately
the
mendicant
friars
became
subjects
of
ridicule
and
reproach
but
the
pope
came
to
the
rescue
of
his
best
supporters
on
the
return
of
thomas
to
paris
he
was
made
doctor
of
theology
at
the
same
time
with
bonaventura
the
franciscan
called
the
seraphic
doctor
between
whom
and
thomas
were
intimate
ties
of
friendship
he
had
now
reached
the
highest
honor
that
the
university
could
bestow
which
was
conferred
with
such
extraordinary
ceremony
that
it
would
seem
to
have
been
a
great
event
in
paris
at
that
time
his
fame
chiefly
rests
on
the
ablest
treatise
written
in
the
middle
ages
the
summa
theologica
in
which
all
the
great
questions
in
theology
and
philosophy
are
minutely
discussed
in
the
most
exhaustive
manner
he
took
the
side
of
the
realists
his
object
being
to
uphold
saint
augustine
he
was
more
a
platonist
in
his
spirit
than
an
aristotelian
although
he
was
indebted
to
aristotle
for
his
method
he
appealed
to
both
reason
and
authority
he
presented
the
christian
religion
in
a
scientific
form
his
book
is
an
assimilation
of
all
that
is
precious
in
the
thinking
of
the
church
if
he
learned
many
things
at
paris
cologne
and
naples
he
was
also
educated
by
chrysostom
by
augustine
and
ambrose
it
is
impossible
says
cardinal
newman
and
no
authority
is
higher
than
his
to
read
the
of
saint
thomas
without
being
struck
by
the
masterly
skill
with
which
he
put
it
together
a
learning
of
the
highest
kind
not
mere
literary
book
knowledge
which
may
have
supplied
the
place
of
indexes
and
tables
in
ages
destitute
of
these
helps
and
when
they
had
to
be
read
in
unarranged
and
fragmentary
manuscripts
but
a
thorough
acquaintance
with
the
whole
range
of
ecclesiastical
antiquity
so
as
to
be
able
to
bring
the
substance
of
all
that
had
been
written
on
any
point
to
bear
upon
the
text
which
involved
it
a
familiarity
with
the
style
of
each
writer
so
as
to
compress
in
a
few
words
the
pith
of
the
whole
page
and
a
power
of
clear
and
orderly
arrangement
in
this
mass
of
knowledge
are
qualities
which
make
this
nearly
perfect
as
an
interpretation
of
patristic
literature
vaughan
in
eulogistic
language
says
the
theologica
may
be
likened
to
one
of
the
great
cathedrals
of
the
middle
ages
infinite
in
detail
but
massive
in
the
grouping
of
pillars
and
arches
forming
a
complete
unity
that
must
have
taxed
the
brain
of
the
architect
to
its
greatest
extent
but
greater
as
work
of
intellect
is
this
digest
of
all
theological
richness
for
one
thousand
years
in
which
the
thread
of
discourse
is
never
lost
sight
of
but
winds
through
a
labyrinth
of
important
discussions
and
digressions
all
bearing
on
the
fundamental
truths
which
paul
declared
and
augustine
systematized
this
treatise
would
seem
to
be
a
thesaurus
of
both
patristic
and
mediaeval
learning
not
a
dictionary
of
knowledge
but
a
system
of
truth
severely
elaborated
in
every
part
a
work
to
be
studied
by
the
mediaeval
students
as
calvin
institutes
were
by
the
scholars
of
the
reformation
and
not
far
different
in
its
scope
and
end
for
the
patristic
the
mediaeval
and
the
protestant
divines
did
not
materially
differ
in
reference
to
the
fundamental
truths
pertaining
to
god
the
incarnation
and
redemption
the
catholic
and
protestant
divines
differ
chiefly
on
the
ideas
pertaining
to
government
and
ecclesiastical
institutions
and
the
various
inventions
of
the
middle
ages
to
uphold
the
authority
of
the
church
not
on
dogmas
strictly
theological
a
student
in
theology
could
even
in
our
times
sit
at
the
feet
of
thomas
aquinas
as
he
could
at
the
feet
of
augustine
or
calvin
except
that
in
the
theology
which
thomas
aquinas
commented
upon
there
is
a
cumbrous
method
borrowed
from
aristotle
which
introduced
infinite
distinctions
and
questions
and
definitions
and
deductions
and
ramifications
which
have
no
charm
to
men
who
have
other
things
to
occupy
their
minds
than
scholastic
subtilties
acute
and
logical
as
they
may
be
thomas
aquinas
was
raised
to
combat
with
the
weapons
most
esteemed
in
his
day
the
various
forms
of
rationalism
pantheism
and
mysticism
which
then
existed
and
were
included
in
the
nominalism
of
his
antagonists
and
as
long
as
universities
are
centres
of
inquiry
the
same
errors
under
other
names
will
have
to
be
combated
but
probably
not
with
the
same
methods
which
marked
the
teachings
of
the
angelical
doctor
in
demolishing
errors
and
systematizing
truth
he
was
the
greatest
benefactor
to
the
cause
of
orthodoxy
that
appeared
in
europe
for
several
centuries
admired
for
his
genius
as
much
as
spencer
and
other
great
lights
of
science
are
in
our
day
but
standing
preeminent
and
lofty
over
all
like
a
beacon
light
to
give
both
guidance
and
warning
to
inquiring
minds
in
every
part
of
christendom
nor
could
popes
and
sovereigns
render
too
great
honor
to
such
a
prodigy
of
genius
they
offered
him
the
abbacy
of
monte
cassino
and
the
archbishopric
of
naples
but
he
preferred
the
life
of
a
quiet
student
finding
in
knowledge
and
study
for
their
own
sake
the
highest
reward
and
pursuing
his
labors
without
the
of
those
high
positions
which
involve
ceremonies
and
cares
and
pomps
yet
which
most
ambitious
men
love
better
than
freedom
placidity
and
intellectual
repose
he
lived
not
in
a
palace
as
he
might
have
lived
surrounded
with
flatterers
luxuries
and
dignities
but
in
a
cell
wearing
his
simple
black
gown
and
walking
barefooted
wherever
he
went
begging
his
daily
bread
according
to
the
rules
of
his
order
his
black
gown
was
not
an
academic
badge
but
the
dominican
dress
his
only
badge
of
distinction
was
the
doctors
cap
vaughan
in
his
heavy
and
unartistic
life
of
thomas
aquinas
has
drawn
a
striking
resemblance
between
plato
and
the
mediaeval
doctor
both
he
says
were
nobly
born
both
were
grave
from
youth
both
loved
truth
with
an
intensity
of
devotion
if
plato
was
instructed
by
socrates
aquinas
was
taught
by
albertus
magnus
if
plato
travelled
into
italy
greece
and
egypt
aquinas
went
to
cologne
naples
bologna
and
rome
if
plato
was
famous
for
his
erudition
aquinas
was
no
less
noted
for
his
universal
knowledge
both
were
naturally
meek
and
gentle
both
led
lives
of
retirement
and
contemplation
both
loved
solitude
both
were
celebrated
for
both
were
brave
both
held
their
pupils
by
their
brilliant
mental
gifts
both
passed
their
time
in
lecturing
to
the
schools
what
the
pythagoreans
were
to
plato
the
benedictines
were
to
the
angelical
both
shrank
from
the
display
of
self
both
were
great
dialecticians
both
reposed
on
eternal
ideas
both
were
oracles
to
their
generation
but
if
aquinas
had
the
soul
of
plato
he
also
had
the
scholastic
gifts
of
aristotle
to
whom
the
church
is
indebted
for
method
and
nomenclature
as
it
was
to
plato
for
synthesis
and
that
exalted
realism
which
went
hand
in
hand
with
christianity
how
far
he
was
indebted
to
plato
it
is
difficult
to
say
he
certainly
had
not
studied
his
dialectics
through
translations
or
in
the
original
but
had
probably
imbibed
the
spirit
of
this
great
philosopher
through
saint
augustine
and
other
orthodox
fathers
who
were
his
admirers
although
both
plato
and
aristotle
accepted
universals
as
the
foundation
of
scientific
inquiry
the
former
arrived
at
them
by
consciousness
and
the
other
by
reasoning
the
spirit
of
the
two
great
masters
of
thought
was
as
essentially
different
as
their
habits
and
lives
plato
believed
that
god
governed
the
world
aristotle
believed
that
it
was
governed
by
chance
the
former
maintained
that
mind
is
divine
and
eternal
the
latter
that
it
is
a
form
of
the
body
and
consequently
mortal
plato
thought
that
the
source
of
happiness
was
in
virtue
and
resemblance
to
god
while
aristotle
placed
it
in
riches
and
outward
prosperity
plato
believed
in
prayer
but
aristotle
thought
that
god
would
not
hear
or
answer
it
and
therefore
that
it
was
useless
plato
believed
in
happiness
after
death
while
aristotle
supposed
that
death
ended
all
pleasure
plato
lived
in
the
world
of
abstract
ideas
aristotle
in
the
realm
of
sense
and
observation
the
one
was
religious
the
other
secular
and
worldly
with
both
the
passion
for
knowledge
was
boundless
but
they
differed
in
their
conceptions
of
knowledge
the
one
basing
it
on
eternal
ideas
and
the
deductions
to
be
drawn
from
them
and
the
other
on
physical
science
the
phenomena
of
nature
those
things
which
are
cognizable
by
the
senses
the
spiritual
life
of
plato
was
a
longing
after
love
and
of
eternal
ideas
by
the
contemplation
of
which
the
soul
sustains
itself
and
becomes
participant
in
immortality
the
life
of
aristotle
was
not
spiritual
but
intellectual
he
was
an
incarnation
of
mere
intellect
the
architect
of
a
great
temple
of
knowledge
which
received
the
name
of
or
the
philosophy
of
first
principles
thomas
aquinas
we
may
see
from
what
has
been
said
was
both
platonic
and
aristotelian
he
resembled
plato
in
his
deep
and
pious
meditations
on
the
eternal
realities
of
the
spiritual
world
while
in
the
severity
of
his
logic
he
resembled
aristotle
from
whom
he
learned
precision
of
language
lucidity
of
statement
and
a
syllogistic
mode
of
argument
well
calculated
to
confirm
what
was
already
known
but
not
to
make
attainments
in
new
fields
of
thought
or
knowledge
if
he
was
gentle
and
loving
and
pious
like
plato
he
was
also
as
calm
and
passionless
as
aristotle
this
great
man
died
at
the
age
of
in
the
year
a
few
years
after
saint
louis
before
his
sum
of
theology
was
completed
he
died
prematurely
exhausted
by
his
intense
studies
leaving
however
treatises
which
filled
seventeen
printed
folio
volumes
one
of
the
most
voluminous
writers
of
the
world
his
fame
was
prodigious
both
as
a
dialectician
and
a
saint
and
he
was
in
due
time
canonized
as
one
of
the
great
pillars
of
the
church
ranking
after
chrysostom
jerome
augustine
and
gregory
the
great
the
standard
authority
for
centuries
of
the
catholic
theology
the
scholastic
philosophy
which
culminated
in
thomas
aquinas
maintained
its
position
in
the
universities
of
europe
until
the
reformation
but
declined
in
earnestness
it
descended
to
the
discussion
of
unimportant
and
often
frivolous
questions
even
the
angelical
doctor
is
quoted
as
discussing
the
absurd
question
as
to
how
many
angels
could
dance
together
on
the
point
of
a
needle
the
play
of
words
became
interminable
things
were
lost
sight
of
in
a
barbarous
jargon
about
questions
which
have
no
interest
to
humanity
and
which
are
utterly
unintelligible
at
the
best
logical
processes
can
add
nothing
to
the
ideas
from
which
they
start
when
these
ideas
are
lofty
discussion
upon
them
elevates
the
mind
and
doubtless
strengthens
its
powers
but
when
the
subjects
themselves
are
frivolous
the
logical
tournaments
in
their
defence
degrade
the
intellect
and
narrow
it
nothing
destroys
intellectual
dignity
more
effectually
than
the
waste
of
energies
in
the
defence
of
what
is
of
no
practical
utility
and
which
can
not
be
applied
to
the
acquisition
of
solid
knowledge
hence
the
scholastic
philosophy
did
not
advance
knowledge
since
it
did
not
seek
the
acquisition
of
new
truths
but
only
the
establishment
of
the
old
its
utility
consisted
in
training
the
human
mind
to
logical
reasonings
it
exercised
the
intellect
and
strengthened
it
as
gymnastics
do
the
body
without
enlarging
it
it
was
nothing
but
barren
dialectics
dry
bones
a
perpetual
fencing
the
soul
cries
out
for
bread
the
scholastics
gave
it
a
stone
we
are
amazed
that
intellectual
giants
equal
to
the
old
greeks
in
acuteness
and
logical
powers
could
waste
their
time
on
the
frivolous
questions
and
dialectical
subtilties
to
which
they
devoted
their
mighty
powers
however
interesting
to
them
nothing
is
drier
and
duller
to
us
nothing
more
barren
and
unsatisfying
than
their
logical
sports
their
treatises
are
like
trees
with
endless
branches
each
leading
to
new
ramifications
with
no
central
point
in
view
and
hence
never
finished
and
which
might
be
carried
on
to
attempt
to
read
their
disquisitions
is
like
walking
in
labyrinths
of
intricacies
by
such
a
method
no
ultimate
truth
could
be
arrived
at
beyond
what
was
assumed
there
is
now
and
then
a
man
who
professes
to
have
derived
light
and
wisdom
from
those
dialectical
displays
since
they
were
doubtless
marvels
of
logical
precision
and
clearness
of
statement
but
in
a
practical
point
of
view
those
masterpieces
of
logic
are
utterly
useless
to
most
modern
inquirers
these
are
interesting
only
as
they
exhibit
the
waste
of
gigantic
energies
they
do
not
even
have
the
merit
of
illustrative
rhetoric
or
eloquence
the
earlier
monks
were
devout
and
spiritual
and
we
can
still
read
their
lofty
meditations
with
profit
since
they
elevate
the
soul
and
make
it
pant
for
the
beatitudes
of
spiritual
communion
with
god
but
the
writings
of
the
scholastic
doctors
are
cold
calm
passionless
and
purely
intellectual
logical
without
being
edifying
we
turn
from
them
however
acute
and
able
with
blended
disappointment
and
despair
they
are
bearing
nothing
but
leaves
such
as
our
lord
did
curse
the
distinctions
are
simply
metaphysical
and
not
moral
why
the
whole
force
of
an
awakening
age
should
have
been
devoted
to
such
subtilties
and
barren
discussion
it
is
difficult
to
see
unless
they
were
found
useful
in
supporting
a
theology
made
up
of
metaphysical
deductions
rather
than
an
interpretation
of
the
meaning
of
scripture
texts
but
there
was
then
no
knowledge
of
greek
or
hebrew
there
was
no
exegetical
research
there
was
no
science
and
no
real
learning
there
was
nothing
but
theology
with
the
exception
of
lives
of
the
saints
the
horizon
of
human
inquiries
was
extremely
narrow
but
when
the
minds
of
very
intellectual
men
were
directed
to
one
particular
field
it
would
be
natural
to
expect
something
remarkable
and
marvellously
elaborate
of
its
kind
such
was
the
scholastic
philosophy
as
a
mere
exhibition
of
dialectical
acumen
minute
distinctions
and
logical
precision
in
the
use
of
words
it
was
wonderful
the
intricacy
and
detail
and
ramifications
of
this
system
were
an
intellectual
feat
which
astonishes
us
yet
which
does
not
instruct
us
certainly
outside
of
a
metaphysical
divinity
which
had
more
charm
to
the
men
of
the
middle
ages
than
it
can
have
to
us
even
in
a
theological
school
where
dogmatic
divinity
is
made
the
most
important
study
the
day
will
soon
come
when
the
principal
chair
in
the
theological
school
will
be
for
the
explanation
of
the
scripture
texts
on
which
dogmas
are
based
and
for
this
great
learning
and
scholarship
will
be
indispensable
to
me
it
is
surprising
that
metaphysics
have
so
long
retained
their
hold
on
the
minds
of
protestant
divines
nothing
is
more
unsatisfactory
and
to
many
more
repulsive
than
metaphysical
divinity
it
is
a
perversion
of
the
spirit
of
christian
teachings
what
says
our
lord
should
be
the
great
inquiry
in
our
schools
of
theology
not
what
deductions
can
be
drawn
from
them
by
a
process
of
ingenious
reasoning
which
often
without
reference
to
other
important
truths
lands
one
in
absurdities
or
at
least
in
systems
but
the
metaphysical
divinity
of
the
schoolmen
had
great
attractions
to
the
students
of
the
middle
ages
and
there
must
have
been
something
in
it
which
we
do
not
appreciate
or
it
would
not
have
maintained
itself
in
the
schools
for
three
hundred
years
perhaps
it
was
what
those
ages
needed
the
discipline
through
which
the
mind
must
go
before
it
could
be
prepared
for
the
scientific
investigations
of
our
own
times
in
an
important
sense
the
scholastic
doctors
were
the
teachers
of
luther
and
bacon
certainly
their
unsatisfactory
science
was
one
of
the
marked
developments
of
the
civilization
of
europe
through
which
the
gothic
nations
must
need
pass
it
has
been
the
fashion
to
ridicule
it
and
depreciate
it
in
our
modern
times
especially
among
protestants
who
have
ridiculed
and
slandered
the
papal
power
and
all
the
institutions
of
the
middle
ages
yet
scholars
might
as
well
ridicule
the
they
were
required
to
study
fifty
years
ago
because
they
are
not
up
to
our
times
we
should
not
disdain
the
early
steps
by
which
future
progress
is
made
easy
we
can
not
despise
men
who
gave
up
their
lives
to
the
contemplation
of
subjects
which
demand
the
highest
tension
of
the
intellectual
faculties
even
if
these
exercises
were
barren
of
utilitarian
results
some
future
age
may
be
surprised
at
the
comparative
unimportance
of
questions
which
interest
this
generation
the
scholastic
philosophy
can
not
indeed
be
utilized
by
us
in
the
pursuit
of
scientific
knowledge
nor
to
recur
to
vaughan
simile
for
the
great
work
of
aquinas
can
a
mediaeval
cathedral
be
utilized
for
purposes
of
oratory
or
business
but
the
cathedral
is
nevertheless
a
grand
monument
suggesting
lofty
sentiments
which
it
would
be
senseless
and
ruthless
barbarism
to
destroy
or
allow
to
fall
into
decay
but
which
should
rather
be
preserved
as
a
precious
memento
of
what
is
most
poetic
and
attractive
in
the
middle
ages
when
any
modern
philosopher
shall
rear
so
gigantic
and
symmetrical
a
monument
of
logical
disquisitions
as
the
summa
theologica
is
said
to
be
by
the
most
competent
authorities
then
the
sneers
of
a
macaulay
or
a
lewes
will
be
entitled
to
more
consideration
it
is
said
that
a
new
edition
of
this
great
mediaeval
work
is
about
to
be
published
under
the
direct
auspices
of
the
pope
as
the
best
and
most
comprehensive
system
of
christian
theology
ever

thomas
becket
prelatical
power
a
great
deal
has
been
written
of
late
years
on
thomas
becket
archbishop
of
canterbury
in
the
reign
of
henry
some
historians
writing
him
up
and
others
writing
him
down
some
making
him
a
martyr
to
the
church
and
others
representing
him
as
an
ambitious
prelate
who
encroached
on
royal
authority
more
of
a
rebel
than
a
patriot
his
history
has
become
interesting
in
view
of
this
very
discrepancy
of
opinion
like
that
of
oliver
cromwell
one
of
those
historical
puzzles
which
always
have
attraction
to
critics
and
there
is
abundant
material
for
either
side
we
choose
to
take
an
advocate
can
make
a
case
in
reference
to
career
with
more
plausibility
than
about
any
other
great
character
in
english
history
with
the
exception
of
queen
elizabeth
cromwell
and
archbishop
laud
the
cause
of
becket
was
the
cause
of
the
middle
ages
he
was
not
the
advocate
of
fundamental
principles
as
were
burke
and
bacon
he
fought
either
for
himself
or
for
principles
whose
importance
has
in
a
measure
passed
away
he
was
a
who
sought
to
make
the
temporal
power
subordinate
to
the
spiritual
he
appears
in
an
interesting
light
only
so
far
as
the
principles
he
sought
to
establish
were
necessary
for
the
elevation
of
society
in
his
ignorant
and
iron
age
moreover
it
was
his
struggles
which
give
to
his
life
its
chief
charm
and
invest
it
with
dramatic
interest
it
was
his
energy
his
audacity
his
ability
in
overcoming
obstacles
which
made
him
memorable
one
of
the
heroes
of
history
like
ambrose
and
hildebrand
an
ecclesiastical
warrior
who
fought
bravely
and
died
without
seeing
the
fruits
of
his
bravery
there
seems
to
be
some
discrepancy
among
historians
as
to
becket
birth
and
origin
some
making
him
out
a
pure
norman
and
others
a
saxon
and
others
again
half
saracen
but
that
is
after
all
a
small
matter
although
the
critics
make
a
great
thing
of
it
they
always
are
inclined
to
wrangle
over
unimportant
points
michelet
thinks
he
was
a
saxon
and
that
his
mother
was
a
saracen
lady
of
rank
who
had
become
enamored
of
the
saxon
when
taken
prisoner
while
on
a
pilgrimage
to
the
holy
land
and
who
returned
with
him
to
england
embraced
his
religion
and
was
publicly
baptized
in
saint
paul
cathedral
her
beauty
and
rank
having
won
attention
but
froude
and
milman
regard
this
as
a
late
legend
it
would
seem
however
that
he
was
born
in
london
about
the
year
or
and
that
his
father
gilbert
becket
was
probably
a
respectable
merchant
and
sheriff
or
portreeve
of
london
and
was
a
norman
his
parents
died
young
leaving
him
not
well
provided
for
but
being
beautiful
and
bright
he
was
sent
to
school
in
an
abbey
and
afterwards
to
oxford
from
oxford
he
went
into
a
house
of
business
in
london
for
three
years
and
contrived
to
attract
the
notice
of
theobald
archbishop
of
canterbury
who
saw
his
talents
sent
him
to
paris
and
thence
to
bologna
to
study
the
canon
law
which
was
necessary
to
a
young
man
who
would
rise
in
the
world
he
was
afterwards
employed
by
theobald
in
confidential
negotiations
the
question
of
the
day
in
england
was
whether
stephen
son
eustace
or
matilda
son
henry
of
anjou
was
the
true
heir
to
the
crown
it
being
settled
that
stephen
should
continue
to
rule
during
his
lifetime
and
that
henry
should
peaceably
follow
him
which
happened
in
a
little
more
than
a
year
becket
had
espoused
the
side
of
henry
the
reign
of
henry
during
which
becket
memorable
career
took
place
was
an
important
one
he
united
through
his
mother
matilda
the
blood
of
the
old
saxon
kings
with
that
of
the
norman
dukes
he
was
the
first
truly
english
sovereign
who
had
sat
on
the
throne
since
the
conquest
in
his
reign
the
blending
of
the
norman
and
saxon
races
was
effected
villages
and
towns
rose
around
the
castles
of
great
norman
nobles
and
the
cathedrals
and
abbeys
of
norman
ecclesiastics
ultimately
these
towns
obtained
freedom
london
became
a
great
city
with
more
than
a
hundred
churches
the
castles
built
during
the
disastrous
civil
wars
of
stephen
usurped
reign
were
demolished
peace
and
order
were
restored
by
a
legitimate
central
power
between
the
young
monarch
of
and
thomas
as
a
favorite
of
theobald
and
as
archdeacon
of
canterbury
an
intimacy
sprang
up
henry
ii
was
the
most
powerful
sovereign
of
western
europe
since
he
was
not
only
king
of
england
but
had
inherited
in
france
anjou
and
touraine
from
his
father
and
normandy
and
maine
from
his
mother
by
his
marriage
with
eleanor
of
aquitaine
he
gained
seven
other
provinces
as
her
dower
the
dominions
of
louis
were
not
half
so
great
as
his
even
in
france
and
henry
was
not
only
a
powerful
sovereign
by
his
great
territorial
possessions
but
also
for
his
tact
and
ability
he
saw
the
genius
of
becket
and
made
him
his
chancellor
loading
him
with
honors
and
perquisites
and
church
benefices
the
power
of
becket
as
chancellor
was
very
great
since
he
was
prime
minister
and
the
civil
administration
of
the
kingdom
was
chiefly
intrusted
to
him
embracing
nearly
all
the
functions
now
performed
by
the
various
members
of
the
cabinet
as
chancellor
he
rendered
great
services
he
effected
a
decided
improvement
in
the
state
of
the
country
it
was
freed
from
robbers
and
bandits
and
brought
under
dominion
of
the
law
he
depressed
the
power
of
the
feudal
nobles
he
appointed
the
most
deserving
people
to
office
he
repaired
the
royal
palaces
increased
the
royal
revenues
and
promoted
agricultural
industry
he
seems
to
have
pursued
a
peace
policy
but
he
was
unscrupulous
and
grasping
his
style
of
life
when
chancellor
was
for
that
age
magnificent
wolsey
in
after
times
scarcely
excelled
him
his
dress
was
as
rich
as
barbaric
taste
could
make
it
for
the
more
barbarous
the
age
the
more
gorgeous
is
the
attire
of
great
dignitaries
the
hospitalities
of
the
chancellor
were
unbounded
he
kept
seven
hundred
horsemen
completely
armed
the
harnesses
of
his
horses
were
embossed
with
gold
and
silver
the
most
powerful
nobles
sent
their
sons
to
serve
in
his
household
as
pages
and
nobles
and
knights
waited
in
his
antechamber
there
never
passed
a
day
when
he
did
not
make
rich
presents
his
expenditure
was
enormous
he
rivalled
the
king
in
magnificence
his
sideboard
was
loaded
with
vessels
of
gold
and
silver
he
was
doubtless
ostentatious
but
his
hospitality
was
free
and
his
person
was
as
accessible
as
a
primitive
bishop
he
is
accused
of
being
light
and
frivolous
but
this
i
doubt
he
had
too
many
cares
and
duties
for
frivolity
he
doubtless
unbent
all
men
loaded
down
with
labors
must
unbend
somewhere
it
was
nothing
against
him
that
he
told
good
stories
at
the
royal
table
or
at
his
own
surrounded
by
earls
and
barons
these
relaxations
preserved
in
him
elasticity
of
mind
without
which
the
greatest
genius
soon
becomes
a
hack
a
plodding
piece
of
mechanism
a
stupid
lump
of
learned
dulness
but
he
was
stained
by
no
vices
or
excesses
he
was
a
man
of
indefatigable
activity
and
all
his
labors
were
in
the
service
of
the
crown
to
which
as
chancellor
he
was
devoted
body
and
soul
is
it
strange
that
such
a
man
should
have
been
offered
the
see
of
canterbury
on
the
death
of
theobald
he
had
been
devoted
to
his
royal
master
and
friend
he
enjoyed
rich
livings
and
was
archdeacon
of
canterbury
he
had
shown
no
opposition
to
the
royal
will
moreover
henry
wanted
an
able
man
for
that
exalted
post
in
order
to
carry
out
his
schemes
of
making
himself
independent
of
priestly
influence
and
papal
interference
so
becket
was
made
archbishop
and
primate
of
the
english
church
at
the
age
of
the
clergy
of
the
province
acquiescing
perhaps
with
secret
complaints
for
he
was
not
even
priest
merely
deacon
and
the
minister
of
an
unscrupulous
king
he
was
ordained
priest
only
just
before
receiving
the
primacy
and
for
that
purpose
nothing
in
england
could
exceed
the
dignity
of
the
see
of
canterbury
even
the
archbishopric
of
york
was
subordinate
becket
as
metropolitan
of
the
english
church
was
second
in
rank
only
to
the
king
himself
he
could
depose
any
ecclesiastic
in
the
realm
he
had
the
exclusive
privilege
of
crowning
the
king
his
decisions
were
final
except
an
appeal
to
rome
no
one
dared
disobey
his
mandates
for
the
law
of
clerical
obedience
was
one
of
the
fundamental
ideas
of
the
age
through
his
clergy
over
whom
his
power
was
absolute
he
controlled
the
people
his
law
courts
had
cognizance
of
questions
which
the
royal
courts
could
not
interfere
with
no
ecclesiastical
dignitary
in
europe
was
his
superior
except
the
pope
the
archbishop
of
canterbury
had
been
a
great
personage
under
the
saxon
kings
dunstan
ruled
england
as
the
prime
minister
of
edward
the
martyr
but
his
influence
would
have
been
nearly
as
great
had
he
been
merely
primate
of
the
church
nor
was
the
power
of
the
archbishop
reduced
by
the
norman
kings
william
the
conqueror
might
have
made
the
spiritual
authority
subordinate
to
the
temporal
if
he
had
followed
his
inclinations
but
he
dared
not
quarrel
with
the
pope
the
great
hildebrand
by
whose
favor
he
was
unmolested
in
the
conquest
of
the
saxons
he
was
on
very
intimate
terms
of
friendship
with
lanfranc
whom
he
made
archbishop
of
canterbury
a
wily
and
ambitious
italian
who
was
devoted
to
the
see
of
rome
and
his
spiritual
monarch
the
influence
of
hildebrand
and
lanfranc
combined
was
too
great
to
be
resisted
nor
did
he
attempt
resistance
he
acquiesced
in
the
necessity
of
making
a
king
of
canterbury
his
mind
was
so
deeply
absorbed
with
his
conquest
and
other
state
matters
that
he
did
not
seem
to
comprehend
the
difficulties
which
might
arise
under
his
successors
in
yielding
so
much
power
to
the
primate
moreover
lanfranc
in
the
quiet
enjoyment
of
his
ecclesiastical
privileges
gave
his
powerful
assistance
in
imposing
the
norman
yoke
he
filled
the
great
sees
with
norman
prelates
he
does
not
seem
to
have
had
much
sympathy
with
the
saxons
or
their
bishops
who
were
not
so
refined
or
intellectual
as
the
bishops
of
france
the
normans
were
a
superior
race
to
the
saxons
in
executive
ability
and
military
enthusiasm
the
chivalric
element
of
english
society
among
the
higher
classes
came
from
the
normans
not
from
the
saxons
in
piety
in
passive
virtues
in
sustained
industry
in
patient
toil
in
love
of
personal
freedom
the
saxons
doubtless
furnished
a
finer
material
for
the
basis
of
an
agricultural
industrial
and
commercial
nation
the
sturdy
yeomen
of
england
were
saxons
the
noble
and
great
administrators
were
normans
in
pride
in
ambition
and
in
executive
ability
the
normans
bore
a
closer
resemblance
to
the
old
heroic
romans
than
did
the
saxons
the
next
archbishop
after
lanfranc
was
anselm
appointed
by
william
rufus
anselm
was
a
great
scholar
the
profoundest
of
the
early
schoolmen
a
man
of
meditative
habits
who
it
was
presumed
would
not
interfere
with
royal
encroachments
william
rufus
never
dreamed
that
the
austere
and
learned
monk
who
had
spent
most
of
his
days
in
the
abbey
of
bec
in
devout
meditations
and
scholastic
inquiries
would
interfere
with
his
rapacity
but
as
we
have
already
seen
anselm
was
conscientious
and
became
the
champion
of
the
party
in
the
west
he
occupied
two
distinct
spheres
he
was
absorbed
in
philosophical
speculations
yet
took
an
interest
in
all
mundane
questions
his
resolve
to
oppose
the
king
usurpations
in
the
spiritual
realm
caused
the
bitter
quarrel
already
described
which
ended
in
a
compromise
when
henry
came
to
the
throne
he
appointed
theobald
a
feeble
but
good
man
to
the
see
of
canterbury
less
ambitious
than
lanfranc
more
inoffensive
than
anselm
a
norman
disinclined
to
quarrel
with
his
sovereign
he
died
during
the
reign
of
henry
and
this
great
monarch
as
we
have
seen
appointed
becket
to
the
vacant
see
thinking
that
in
the
double
capacity
of
chancellor
and
archbishop
he
would
be
a
very
powerful
ally
but
he
was
amazingly
deceived
in
the
character
of
his
chancellor
becket
had
not
sought
the
office
the
office
had
sought
him
it
would
seem
that
he
accepted
it
unwillingly
he
knew
that
new
responsibilities
and
duties
would
be
imposed
upon
him
which
if
he
discharged
conscientiously
like
anselm
would
in
all
probability
alienate
his
friend
the
king
and
provoke
a
desperate
contest
and
when
the
courtly
and
luxurious
chancellor
held
out
in
normandy
the
skirts
of
his
gilded
and
embroidered
garments
to
show
how
unfit
he
was
for
an
archbishop
henry
ought
to
have
perceived
that
a
future
estrangement
was
a
probability
better
for
henry
had
becket
remained
in
the
civil
service
but
henry
with
all
his
penetration
had
not
fathomed
the
mind
of
his
favorite
becket
may
have
been
a
dissembler
or
a
great
change
may
have
been
wrought
in
his
character
probably
the
new
responsibilities
imposed
upon
him
as
primate
of
the
english
church
pressed
upon
his
conscience
he
knew
that
supreme
allegiance
was
due
to
the
pope
as
head
of
the
church
and
that
if
compelled
to
choose
between
the
pope
and
the
king
he
must
obey
the
pope
he
was
ambitious
doubtless
but
his
subsequent
career
shows
that
he
preferred
the
liberties
of
his
church
to
the
temporal
interests
of
the
sovereign
he
was
not
a
theologian
like
lanfranc
and
anselm
of
all
the
great
characters
who
preceded
him
he
most
resembles
ambrose
ambrose
the
governor
and
a
layman
became
archbishop
of
milan
becket
the
minister
of
a
king
and
only
deacon
became
archbishop
of
canterbury
the
character
of
both
these
great
men
changed
on
their
elevation
to
high
ecclesiastical
position
they
both
became
and
defended
the
prerogatives
of
the
clergy
but
ambrose
was
superior
to
becket
in
his
zeal
to
defend
the
doctrines
of
the
church
it
does
not
appear
that
becket
took
much
interest
in
doctrines
in
his
age
there
was
no
dissent
everybody
outwardly
at
least
was
orthodox
in
england
certainly
there
were
no
heretics
had
becket
remained
chancellor
in
all
probability
he
would
not
have
quarrelled
with
henry
as
archbishop
he
knew
what
was
expected
of
him
and
he
knew
also
the
infamy
in
store
for
him
should
he
betray
his
cause
i
do
not
believe
he
was
a
hypocrite
every
subsequent
act
of
his
life
shows
his
sincerity
and
his
devotion
to
his
church
against
his
own
interests
becket
was
no
sooner
ordained
priest
and
consecrated
as
archbishop
than
he
changed
his
habits
he
became
as
austere
as
lanfranc
he
laid
aside
his
former
ostentation
he
clothed
himself
in
sackcloth
he
mortified
his
body
with
fasts
and
laceration
he
associated
only
with
the
pious
and
the
learned
he
frequented
the
cloisters
and
places
of
meditation
he
received
into
his
palace
the
needy
and
the
miserable
he
washed
the
feet
of
thirteen
beggars
every
day
he
conformed
to
the
standard
of
piety
in
his
age
he
called
forth
the
admiration
of
his
attendants
by
his
devotion
to
clerical
duties
he
was
says
james
stephen
a
second
moses
entering
the
tabernacle
at
the
accepted
time
for
the
contemplation
of
his
god
and
going
out
from
it
in
order
to
perform
some
work
of
piety
to
his
neighbor
he
was
like
one
of
god
angels
on
the
ladder
whose
top
reached
the
heavens
now
descending
to
lighten
the
wants
of
men
now
ascending
to
behold
the
divine
majesty
and
the
splendor
of
the
heavenly
one
his
prime
councillor
was
reason
which
ruled
his
passions
as
a
mistress
guides
her
servants
under
her
guidance
he
was
conducted
to
virtue
which
wrapped
up
in
itself
and
embracing
everything
within
itself
never
looks
forward
for
anything
additional
this
is
the
testimony
of
his
biographer
and
has
not
been
explained
away
or
denied
although
it
is
probably
true
that
becket
did
not
purge
the
corruptions
of
the
church
or
punish
the
disorders
and
vices
of
the
clergy
as
hildebrand
did
but
i
only
speak
of
his
private
character
i
admit
that
he
was
no
reformer
he
was
simply
the
aiming
to
secure
the
ascendency
of
the
spiritual
power
becket
is
not
immortal
for
his
reforms
or
his
theological
attainments
but
for
his
intrepidity
his
courage
his
devotion
to
his
cause
a
hero
and
not
a
man
of
progress
a
man
who
fought
a
fight
it
should
be
the
aim
of
an
historian
to
show
for
what
he
was
distinguished
to
describe
his
warfare
not
to
abuse
him
because
he
was
not
a
philosopher
and
reformer
he
lived
in
the
twelfth
century
one
of
the
first
things
which
opened
the
eyes
of
the
king
was
the
resignation
of
the
chancellor
the
king
doubtless
made
him
primate
of
the
english
hierarchy
in
order
that
he
might
combine
both
offices
but
they
were
incompatible
unless
becket
was
willing
to
be
the
unscrupulous
tool
of
the
king
in
everything
of
course
henry
could
not
long
remain
the
friend
of
the
man
who
he
thought
had
duped
him
before
a
year
had
passed
his
friendship
was
turned
to
secret
but
bitter
enmity
nor
was
it
long
before
an
event
occurred
a
small
matter
which
brought
the
king
and
the
prelate
into
open
collision
the
matter
was
this
a
young
nobleman
who
held
a
clerical
office
committed
a
murder
as
an
ecclesiastic
he
was
brought
before
the
court
of
the
bishop
of
lincoln
and
was
sentenced
to
pay
a
small
fine
but
public
justice
was
not
satisfied
and
the
sheriff
summoned
the
canon
who
refused
to
plead
before
him
the
matter
was
referred
to
the
king
who
insisted
that
the
murderer
should
be
tried
in
the
civil
court
that
a
sacred
profession
should
not
screen
a
man
who
had
committed
a
crime
against
society
while
the
king
had
as
we
think
justice
on
his
side
yet
in
this
matter
he
interfered
with
the
jurisdiction
of
the
spiritual
courts
which
had
been
in
force
since
constantine
theodosius
and
justinian
had
confirmed
the
privilege
of
the
church
on
the
ground
that
the
irregularities
of
a
body
of
men
devoted
to
the
offices
of
religion
should
be
veiled
from
the
common
eye
so
that
ecclesiastics
were
sometimes
protected
when
they
should
be
punished
but
if
the
ecclesiastical
courts
had
abuses
they
were
generally
presided
over
by
good
and
wise
men
more
learned
than
the
officers
of
the
civil
courts
and
very
popular
in
the
middle
ages
and
justice
in
them
was
generally
administered
so
much
were
they
valued
in
a
dark
age
when
the
clergy
were
the
most
learned
men
of
their
times
that
much
business
came
gradually
to
be
transacted
in
them
which
previously
had
been
settled
in
the
civil
courts
as
tithes
testaments
breaches
of
contract
perjuries
and
questions
pertaining
to
marriage
but
henry
did
not
like
these
courts
and
was
determined
to
weaken
their
jurisdiction
and
transfer
their
power
to
his
own
courts
in
order
to
strengthen
the
royal
authority
enlightened
jurists
and
historians
in
our
times
here
sympathize
with
henry
ecclesiastics
defend
the
jurisdiction
of
the
spiritual
courts
since
they
upheld
the
power
of
the
church
so
useful
in
the
middle
ages
the
king
began
the
attack
where
the
spiritual
courts
were
weakest
protection
afforded
to
clergymen
accused
of
crime
so
he
assembled
a
council
of
bishops
and
barons
to
meet
him
at
westminster
the
bishops
at
first
were
inclined
to
yield
to
the
king
but
becket
gained
them
over
and
would
make
no
concession
he
stood
up
for
the
privileges
of
his
order
it
was
neither
justice
nor
right
which
he
defended
but
his
church
at
all
hazards
not
her
doctrines
but
her
prerogatives
he
would
present
a
barrier
against
royal
encroachments
even
if
they
were
for
the
welfare
of
the
realm
he
would
defend
the
independence
of
the
clergy
and
their
power
perhaps
as
an
offset
to
royal
power
in
his
rigid
defence
of
the
privileges
of
the
clergy
we
see
the
churchman
not
the
statesman
we
see
the
antagonist
not
the
ally
of
the
king
henry
was
of
course
enraged
who
can
wonder
he
was
bearded
by
his
former
favorite
by
one
of
his
subjects
if
becket
was
narrow
he
probably
was
conscientious
he
may
have
been
ambitious
of
wielding
unlimited
spiritual
authority
but
it
should
be
noted
that
had
he
not
quarrelled
with
the
king
he
could
have
been
both
archbishop
and
chancellor
and
in
that
double
capacity
wielded
more
power
and
had
he
been
disposed
to
serve
his
royal
master
had
he
been
more
gentle
the
king
might
not
have
pushed
out
his
policy
of
crippling
the
spiritual
courts
might
have
waived
delayed
or
made
concessions
but
now
these
two
great
potentates
were
in
open
opposition
and
a
deadly
warfare
was
at
hand
it
is
this
fight
which
gives
to
becket
all
his
historical
importance
it
is
not
for
me
to
settle
the
merits
of
the
case
if
i
could
only
to
describe
the
battle
the
lawyers
would
probably
take
one
side
and
catholic
priests
would
take
the
other
and
perhaps
all
even
men
like
froude
and
freeman
both
very
learned
and
able
are
totally
at
issue
not
merely
as
to
the
merits
of
the
case
but
even
as
to
the
facts
froude
seems
to
hate
becket
and
all
other
churchmen
as
much
as
freeman
loves
them
i
think
one
reason
why
froude
exalts
so
highly
henry
viii
is
because
he
put
his
foot
on
the
clergy
and
took
away
their
revenues
but
with
the
war
of
partisans
i
have
nothing
to
do
except
the
war
between
henry
ii
and
thomas
becket
this
war
waxed
hot
when
a
second
council
of
bishops
and
barons
was
assembled
at
clarendon
near
winchester
to
give
their
assent
to
certain
resolutions
which
the
king
judges
had
prepared
in
reference
to
the
questions
at
issue
and
other
things
tending
to
increase
the
royal
authority
they
are
called
in
history
the
constitutions
of
clarendon
the
gist
and
substance
of
them
were
that
during
the
vacancy
of
any
bishopric
or
abbey
of
royal
foundation
the
estates
were
to
be
in
the
custody
of
the
crown
that
all
disputes
between
laymen
and
clergymen
should
be
tried
in
the
civil
courts
that
clergymen
accused
of
crime
should
if
the
judges
decided
be
tried
in
the
king
court
and
if
found
guilty
be
handed
over
to
the
secular
arm
for
punishment
that
no
officer
or
tenant
of
the
king
should
be
excommunicated
without
the
king
consent
that
no
peasant
son
should
be
ordained
without
permission
of
his
feudal
lord
that
great
ecclesiastical
personages
should
not
leave
the
kingdom
without
the
king
consent
anybody
must
see
that
these
articles
were
nothing
more
nor
less
than
the
surrender
of
the
most
important
and
vital
privileges
of
the
church
into
the
hands
of
the
king
not
merely
her
properties
but
her
liberties
even
a
surrender
of
the
only
weapon
with
which
she
defended
herself
in
extreme
cases
that
of
excommunication
it
was
the
virtual
confiscation
of
the
church
in
favor
of
an
aggressive
and
unscrupulous
monarch
could
we
expect
becket
to
sign
such
an
agreement
to
part
with
his
powers
to
betray
the
church
of
which
he
was
the
first
dignitary
in
england
when
have
men
parted
with
their
privileges
except
upon
compulsion
he
never
would
have
given
up
his
prerogatives
he
never
meant
for
a
moment
to
do
so
he
was
not
the
man
for
such
a
base
submission
yet
he
was
so
worried
and
threatened
by
the
king
who
had
taken
away
from
him
the
government
of
the
prince
his
son
and
the
custody
of
certain
castles
he
was
so
importuned
by
the
bishops
themselves
for
fear
that
the
peace
of
the
country
would
be
endangered
that
in
a
weak
moment
he
promised
to
sign
the
articles
reserving
this
phrase
saving
the
honor
of
his
order
with
this
reservation
he
thought
he
could
sign
the
agreement
for
he
could
include
under
such
a
phrase
whatever
he
pleased
but
when
really
called
to
fulfil
his
promise
and
sign
with
his
own
hand
those
constitutions
he
wavered
he
burst
out
in
passionate
for
having
made
a
promise
he
never
intended
to
keep
never
never
he
said
i
will
never
do
it
so
long
as
breath
is
in
my
body
in
his
repentance
he
mortified
himself
with
new
he
suspended
himself
from
the
service
of
the
altar
he
was
overwhelmed
with
grief
shame
rage
and
penitence
he
resolved
he
would
not
yield
up
the
privileges
of
his
order
come
what
might
not
even
if
the
pope
gave
him
authority
to
sign
the
dejected
and
humbled
metropolitan
advanced
to
the
royal
throne
with
downcast
eye
but
unfaltering
voice
accused
himself
of
weakness
and
folly
and
firmly
refused
to
sign
the
articles
miserable
wretch
that
i
am
cried
he
with
bitter
tears
coursing
down
his
cheeks
i
see
the
anglican
church
enslaved
in
punishment
for
my
sins
but
it
is
all
right
i
was
taken
from
the
court
not
the
cloister
to
fill
this
station
from
the
palace
of
caesar
not
the
school
of
the
saviour
i
was
a
feeder
of
birds
but
suddenly
made
a
feeder
of
men
a
patron
of
a
follower
of
hounds
and
i
became
a
shepherd
over
so
many
souls
surely
i
am
rightly
abandoned
by
god
he
then
took
his
departure
for
canterbury
but
was
soon
summoned
to
a
grand
council
at
northampton
to
answer
serious
charges
he
was
called
to
account
for
the
sums
he
had
spent
as
chancellor
and
for
various
alleged
injustices
he
was
found
guilty
by
a
court
controlled
by
the
king
and
sentenced
to
pay
a
heavy
fine
which
he
paid
the
next
day
new
charges
were
preferred
and
he
was
condemned
to
a
still
heavier
fine
which
he
was
unable
to
pay
but
he
found
sureties
on
the
next
day
still
heavier
charges
were
made
and
new
fines
inflicted
which
would
have
embarrassed
the
temporalities
of
his
see
he
now
perceived
that
the
king
was
bent
on
his
ruin
that
the
more
he
yielded
the
more
he
would
be
expected
to
yield
he
therefore
resolved
to
yield
no
further
but
to
stand
on
his
rights
but
before
he
made
his
final
resistance
he
armed
himself
with
his
crozier
and
sought
counsel
from
the
bishops
assembled
in
another
chamber
of
the
royal
castle
the
bishops
were
divided
some
for
him
some
against
him
gilbert
foliot
of
london
put
him
in
mind
of
the
benefits
he
had
received
from
henry
and
the
humble
condition
from
which
he
was
raised
and
advised
him
to
resign
for
sake
of
peace
henry
of
winchester
a
relative
of
the
king
bade
him
resign
roger
of
worcester
was
if
i
advise
to
resist
the
king
i
shall
be
put
out
of
the
synagogue
said
he
i
counsel
nothing
the
bishop
of
chichester
declared
that
becket
was
primate
no
longer
as
he
had
gone
against
the
laws
of
the
realm
in
the
midst
of
this
conference
the
earl
of
leicester
entered
and
announced
the
sentence
of
the
peers
then
gathering
himself
up
to
his
full
height
the
primate
with
austere
dignity
addressed
the
earl
and
the
bishops
my
brethren
our
enemies
are
pressing
hard
upon
us
and
the
whole
world
is
against
us
but
i
now
enjoin
you
in
virtue
of
your
obedience
and
in
peril
of
your
orders
not
to
be
present
in
any
cause
which
may
be
made
against
my
person
and
i
appeal
to
that
refuge
of
the
distressed
the
holy
see
and
i
command
you
as
your
primate
and
in
the
name
of
the
pope
to
put
forth
the
censures
of
the
church
in
behalf
of
your
archbishop
should
the
secular
arm
lay
violent
hands
upon
me
for
be
assured
though
this
frail
body
may
yield
to
persecution
since
all
flesh
is
weak
yet
shall
my
spirit
never
yield
then
pushing
his
way
he
swept
through
the
chamber
reached
the
quadrangle
of
the
palace
mounted
his
horse
reached
his
lodgings
gave
a
banquet
to
some
beggars
stole
away
in
disguise
and
fled
reaching
the
coast
in
safety
and
succeeding
in
crossing
over
to
flanders
he
was
now
out
of
the
king
power
who
doubtless
would
have
imprisoned
him
and
perhaps
killed
him
for
he
hated
him
with
the
intensest
hatred
becket
had
deceived
him
having
trifled
with
him
by
taking
an
oath
to
sign
the
constitutions
of
clarendon
and
then
broken
his
oath
and
defied
his
authority
appealing
to
the
pope
and
perhaps
involving
the
king
in
a
quarrel
with
the
supreme
spiritual
power
of
christendom
finally
he
had
deserted
his
post
and
fled
the
kingdom
he
had
defeated
the
king
in
his
most
darling
schemes
but
although
becket
was
an
exile
a
fugitive
and
a
wanderer
he
was
still
archbishop
of
canterbury
he
was
the
head
of
the
english
church
and
all
the
clergy
of
the
kingdom
owed
him
spiritual
obedience
he
still
had
the
power
of
excommunicating
the
king
and
the
sole
right
of
crowning
his
successor
if
the
pope
should
take
his
side
and
the
king
of
france
and
other
temporal
powers
becket
would
be
no
unequal
match
for
the
king
it
was
a
grand
crisis
which
henry
comprehended
and
he
therefore
sent
some
of
his
most
powerful
barons
and
prelates
to
the
continent
to
advance
his
cause
and
secure
the
papal
interposition
becket
did
not
remain
long
in
flanders
since
the
count
was
cold
and
did
not
take
his
side
he
escaped
and
sought
shelter
and
aid
from
the
king
of
france
louis
vii
was
a
feeble
monarch
but
he
hated
henry
ii
and
admired
becket
he
took
him
under
his
protection
and
wrote
a
letter
to
the
pope
in
his
behalf
that
pope
was
alexander
iii
himself
an
exile
living
in
sens
and
placed
in
a
situation
of
great
difficulty
struggling
as
he
was
with
an
and
the
great
frederic
barbarossa
emperor
of
germany
moreover
he
was
a
personal
friend
of
henry
to
whom
he
had
been
indebted
for
his
elevation
to
the
papal
throne
his
course
therefore
was
and
dilatory
and
vacillating
although
he
doubtless
was
on
the
side
of
the
prelate
who
exalted
ecclesiastical
authority
but
he
was
obliged
from
policy
to
be
prudent
and
conciliatory
he
patiently
heard
both
sides
but
decided
nothing
all
he
consented
to
do
was
to
send
cardinal
legates
to
england
but
intrusted
to
none
but
himself
the
prerogatives
of
final
judgment
after
henry
ambassadors
had
left
becket
appeared
with
a
splendid
train
of
three
hundred
horsemen
the
archbishop
of
rheims
the
brothers
of
the
king
of
france
and
a
long
array
of
bishops
the
pope
dared
not
receive
him
with
the
warmth
he
felt
but
was
courteous
more
so
than
his
cardinals
and
becket
unfolded
and
discussed
the
constitutions
of
clarendon
which
of
course
found
no
favor
with
the
pope
he
rebuked
becket
for
his
weakness
in
promising
to
sign
a
paper
which
curtailed
so
fundamentally
the
privileges
of
the
church
some
historians
affirm
he
did
not
extend
to
him
the
protection
he
deserved
although
he
confirmed
him
in
his
office
he
sent
him
to
the
hospitable
care
of
the
abbot
of
pontigny
go
now
he
said
and
learn
what
privation
is
and
in
the
company
of
christ
humblest
servants
subdue
the
flesh
to
the
spirit
in
this
cistercian
abbey
it
would
seem
that
becket
lived
in
great
austerity
tearing
his
flesh
with
his
nails
and
inflicting
on
himself
severe
flagellations
so
that
his
health
suffered
and
his
dreams
haunted
him
he
was
protected
but
he
could
not
escape
annoyances
and
persecutions
henry
in
his
wrath
sequestrated
the
estates
of
the
archbishopric
the
incumbents
of
his
benefices
were
expelled
all
his
relatives
and
dependents
were
banished
some
four
hundred
people
men
women
and
children
the
bishops
sent
him
ironical
letters
and
hoped
his
fasts
would
benefit
his
soul
the
quarrel
now
was
of
great
interest
to
all
europe
it
was
nothing
less
than
a
battle
between
the
spiritual
and
temporal
powers
like
that
a
century
before
between
hildebrand
and
the
emperor
of
germany
although
the
pope
was
obliged
from
motives
of
policy
for
fear
of
being
deposed
to
seem
neutral
and
attempt
to
conciliate
still
the
war
really
was
carried
on
in
his
behalf
the
great
the
terrible
the
magnificent
in
the
fate
of
becket
says
michelet
arises
from
his
being
charged
weak
and
unassisted
with
the
interests
of
the
church
universal
a
post
which
belonged
to
the
pope
himself
he
was
still
archbishop
but
his
revenues
were
cut
off
and
had
it
not
been
for
the
bounty
of
louis
the
king
of
france
who
admired
him
and
respected
his
cause
he
might
have
fared
as
a
simple
monk
the
pope
allowed
him
to
excommunicate
the
persons
who
occupied
his
estates
but
not
the
king
himself
he
feared
a
revolt
of
the
english
church
from
papal
authority
since
henry
was
supreme
in
england
and
had
won
over
to
his
cause
the
english
bishops
the
whole
question
became
complicated
and
interesting
it
was
the
common
topic
of
discourse
in
all
the
castles
and
convents
of
europe
the
pope
timid
and
calculating
began
to
fear
he
had
supported
becket
too
far
and
pressed
upon
him
a
reconciliation
with
henry
much
to
the
disgust
of
becket
who
seemed
to
comprehend
the
issue
better
than
did
the
pope
for
the
pope
had
in
his
desire
to
patch
up
the
quarrel
permitted
the
son
of
henry
to
be
crowned
by
the
archbishop
of
york
which
was
not
only
an
infringement
of
the
privileges
of
the
primate
but
was
a
blow
against
the
spiritual
power
so
long
as
the
archbishop
of
canterbury
had
the
exclusive
privilege
of
crowning
a
king
the
king
was
dependent
in
a
measure
on
the
primate
and
through
him
on
the
pope
at
this
suicidal
act
on
the
part
of
alexander
becket
lost
all
patience
and
wrote
to
him
a
letter
of
blended
indignation
and
reproach
why
said
he
lay
in
my
path
a
how
can
you
blind
yourself
to
the
wrong
which
christ
suffers
in
me
and
yourself
and
yet
you
call
on
me
like
a
hireling
to
be
silent
i
might
flourish
in
power
and
riches
and
pleasures
and
be
feared
and
honored
of
all
but
since
the
lord
hath
called
me
weak
and
unworthy
as
i
am
to
the
oversight
of
the
english
church
i
prefer
proscription
exile
poverty
misery
and
death
rather
than
traffic
with
the
liberties
of
the
church
what
language
to
a
pope
what
a
reproof
from
a
subordinate
how
grandly
the
character
of
becket
looms
up
here
i
say
nothing
of
his
cause
it
may
have
been
a
right
or
a
wrong
one
who
shall
settle
whether
spiritual
or
temporal
power
should
have
the
ascendency
in
the
middle
ages
i
speak
only
of
his
heroism
his
fidelity
to
his
cause
his
undoubted
sincerity
men
do
not
become
exiles
and
martyrs
voluntarily
unless
they
are
backed
by
a
great
cause
becket
may
have
been
haughty
irascible
ambitious
very
likely
but
what
then
the
more
personal
faults
he
had
the
greater
does
his
devotion
to
the
interests
of
the
church
appear
fighting
as
it
were
alone
and
unassisted
undaunted
against
the
advice
of
his
friends
unsupported
by
the
pope
he
now
hurls
his
anathemas
from
his
retreat
in
france
he
excommunicates
the
bishop
of
salisbury
and
john
of
oxford
and
the
archdeacon
of
ilchester
and
the
lord
de
luci
and
everybody
who
adhered
to
the
constitutions
of
clarendon
the
bishops
of
england
remonstrate
with
him
and
remind
him
of
his
plebeian
origin
and
his
obligations
to
the
king
to
whom
he
replies
i
am
not
indeed
sprung
from
noble
ancestors
but
i
would
rather
be
the
man
to
whom
nobility
of
mind
gives
the
advantages
of
birth
than
to
be
the
degenerate
issue
of
an
illustrious
family
david
was
taken
from
the
sheepfold
to
be
a
ruler
of
god
people
and
peter
was
taken
from
fishing
to
be
the
head
of
the
church
i
was
born
under
a
humble
roof
yet
nevertheless
god
has
intrusted
me
with
the
liberties
of
the
church
which
i
will
guard
with
my
latest
breath
henry
now
threatens
to
confiscate
the
property
of
all
the
cistercian
convents
in
england
and
the
abbot
of
pontigny
at
the
command
of
his
general
is
forced
to
drive
becket
away
from
his
sanctuary
becket
retires
to
sens
sad
at
heart
and
grieved
that
the
excommunications
which
he
had
inflicted
should
have
been
removed
by
the
pope
then
louis
the
king
of
france
made
war
on
henry
and
took
becket
under
his
protection
the
pope
rebuked
louis
for
the
war
but
louis
retorted
by
telling
alexander
that
it
was
a
shame
for
him
not
to
give
up
his
policy
in
so
doing
louis
spoke
out
the
heart
of
christendom
the
pope
at
last
aroused
excommunicated
the
archbishop
of
york
for
crowning
the
son
of
henry
and
threatened
henry
himself
with
an
interdict
and
recalled
his
legates
becket
also
fulminated
his
excommunications
there
was
hardly
a
prelate
or
royal
chaplain
in
england
who
was
not
under
ecclesiastical
censure
the
bishops
began
to
waver
henry
had
reason
to
fear
he
might
lose
the
support
of
his
english
subjects
and
norman
likewise
he
could
do
nothing
with
the
whole
church
against
him
the
king
was
therefore
obliged
to
compromise
several
times
before
he
had
sought
reconciliation
with
his
dreadful
enemy
but
becket
always
in
his
promises
fell
back
on
the
phrase
saving
the
honor
of
his
order
or
saving
the
honor
of
god
but
now
amid
the
fire
of
excommunications
henry
was
compelled
to
make
his
peace
with
the
man
he
detested
he
himself
did
not
much
care
for
the
priestly
thunderbolts
but
his
clergy
and
his
subjects
did
the
penalty
of
eternal
fire
was
a
dreadful
fear
to
those
who
believed
as
everybody
then
did
in
the
hell
of
which
the
popes
were
supposed
to
hold
the
keys
this
fear
sustained
the
empire
of
the
popes
it
was
the
basis
of
sacerdotal
rule
in
the
middle
ages
hence
becket
was
so
powerful
even
in
exile
his
greatness
was
in
his
character
his
power
was
in
his
spiritual
weapons
in
the
hollow
reconciliation
at
last
effected
between
the
king
and
the
prelate
henry
promised
to
confirm
becket
in
his
powers
and
dignities
and
molest
him
no
more
but
he
haughtily
refused
the
customary
kiss
of
peace
becket
saw
the
omen
so
did
the
king
of
france
the
peace
was
inconclusive
it
was
a
truce
not
a
treaty
both
parties
distrusted
each
other
but
henry
was
weary
with
the
struggle
and
becket
was
tired
of
exile
never
pleasant
even
if
voluntary
moreover
the
prelate
had
gained
the
moral
victory
even
as
hildebrand
did
when
the
emperor
of
germany
stooped
as
a
suppliant
in
the
fortress
of
canossa
the
king
of
england
had
virtually
yielded
to
the
archbishop
of
canterbury
perhaps
becket
felt
that
his
mission
was
accomplished
that
he
had
done
the
work
for
which
he
was
raised
up
wearied
sickened
with
the
world
disgusted
with
the
pope
despising
his
bishops
perhaps
he
was
willing
to
die
he
had
a
presentiment
that
he
should
die
as
a
martyr
so
had
the
french
king
and
his
prelates
but
becket
longed
to
return
to
his
church
and
celebrate
the
festivities
of
christmas
so
he
made
up
his
mind
to
return
to
england
although
i
know
of
a
truth
he
said
i
shall
meet
my
passion
there
before
embarking
he
made
a
friendly
and
parting
visit
to
the
king
of
france
and
then
rode
to
the
coast
with
an
escort
of
one
hundred
horsemen
as
dover
was
guarded
by
the
king
retainers
who
might
harm
him
he
landed
at
sandwich
his
own
town
the
next
day
he
set
out
for
canterbury
after
an
absence
of
seven
years
the
whole
population
lined
the
road
strewed
it
with
flowers
and
rent
the
air
with
songs
their
beloved
archbishop
had
returned
on
reaching
canterbury
he
went
directly
to
his
cathedral
and
seated
himself
on
his
throne
and
the
monks
came
and
kissed
him
with
tears
in
their
eyes
one
herbert
said
christ
has
conquered
christ
is
now
king
from
canterbury
becket
made
a
sort
of
triumphal
progress
through
the
kingdom
with
the
pretence
of
paying
a
visit
to
the
young
king
at
woodstock
exciting
rather
than
allaying
the
causes
of
discord
scattering
his
excommunications
still
haughty
restless
implacable
so
that
the
court
became
alarmed
and
ordered
him
to
return
to
his
diocese
he
obeyed
as
he
wished
to
celebrate
christmas
at
home
and
ascending
his
pulpit
preached
according
to
michelet
from
this
singular
text
i
am
come
to
die
in
the
midst
of
you
henry
at
this
time
was
on
the
continent
and
was
greatly
annoyed
at
the
reports
of
becket
conduct
which
reached
him
then
there
arrived
three
bishops
whom
the
primate
had
excommunicated
with
renewed
complaints
and
grievances
assuring
him
there
would
be
no
peace
so
long
as
becket
lived
henry
was
almost
wild
with
rage
and
perplexity
what
could
he
do
he
dared
not
execute
the
archbishop
as
henry
viii
would
have
done
in
his
age
the
prelate
was
almost
as
powerful
as
the
king
violence
to
his
person
was
the
last
thing
to
do
for
this
would
have
involved
the
king
in
war
with
the
adherents
of
the
pope
and
would
have
entailed
an
excommunication
still
the
supremest
desire
of
henry
soul
was
to
get
becket
out
of
the
way
so
yielding
to
an
impulse
of
passion
he
said
to
his
attendants
is
there
no
one
to
relieve
me
from
the
insults
of
this
and
turbulent
priest
among
these
attendants
were
four
courtiers
or
knights
of
high
birth
and
large
estates
who
hearing
these
reproachful
words
left
the
court
at
once
crossed
the
channel
and
repaired
to
the
castle
of
sir
ranulf
de
broc
the
great
enemy
of
becket
who
had
molested
him
in
innumerable
ways
some
friendly
person
contrived
to
acquaint
becket
with
his
danger
to
whom
he
paid
no
heed
knowing
it
very
well
himself
he
knew
he
was
to
die
and
resolved
to
die
bravely
the
four
armed
knights
meanwhile
on
the
of
december
rode
with
an
escort
to
canterbury
dined
at
the
augustinian
abbey
and
entered
the
of
the
archbishop
palace
as
becket
had
finished
his
meal
and
had
retired
to
an
inner
room
with
his
chaplain
and
a
few
intimate
friends
they
then
entered
the
hall
and
sought
the
archbishop
who
received
them
in
silence
sir
reginald
fitzurst
then
broke
the
silence
with
these
words
we
bring
you
the
commands
of
the
king
beyond
the
sea
that
you
repair
without
delay
to
the
young
king
presence
and
swear
allegiance
and
further
he
commands
you
to
absolve
the
bishops
you
have
excommunicated
on
becket
refusal
the
knight
continued
since
you
will
not
obey
the
royal
command
is
that
you
and
your
clergy
forthwith
depart
from
the
realm
never
more
to
return
becket
angrily
declared
he
would
never
again
leave
england
the
knights
then
sprang
to
their
feet
and
departed
enjoining
the
attendants
to
prevent
the
escape
of
becket
who
exclaimed
do
you
think
i
shall
fly
then
neither
for
the
king
nor
any
living
man
will
i
fly
you
can
not
be
more
ready
to
kill
me
than
i
am
to
die
he
sought
however
the
shelter
of
his
cathedral
as
the
vesper
bell
summoned
him
to
prayers
followed
by
the
armed
knights
with
a
company
of
driving
before
them
a
crowd
of
monks
the
archbishop
was
standing
on
the
steps
of
the
choir
beyond
the
central
pillar
which
reached
to
the
roof
of
the
cathedral
in
the
dim
light
shed
by
the
candles
of
the
altars
so
that
only
the
outline
of
his
noble
figure
could
be
seen
when
the
knights
closed
around
him
and
fitzurst
seized
him
perhaps
meaning
to
drag
him
away
as
a
prisoner
to
the
king
or
outside
the
church
before
despatching
him
becket
cried
touch
me
not
thou
abominable
wretch
at
the
same
time
hurling
tracy
another
of
the
knights
to
the
ground
who
rising
wounded
him
in
the
head
with
his
sword
the
archbishop
then
bent
his
neck
to
the
assassins
exclaiming
i
am
prepared
to
die
for
christ
and
his
church
such
was
the
murder
of
becket
a
martyr
as
he
has
been
generally
regarded
for
the
liberties
of
the
church
but
according
to
some
justly
punished
for
presumptuous
opposition
to
his
sovereign
the
assassination
was
a
shock
to
christendom
the
most
intrepid
churchman
of
his
age
was
slain
at
his
post
for
doing
as
he
believed
his
duty
no
one
felt
the
shock
more
than
the
king
himself
who
knew
he
would
be
held
responsible
for
the
murder
he
dreaded
the
consequences
and
shut
himself
up
for
three
days
in
his
chamber
refusing
food
issuing
orders
for
the
arrest
of
the
murderers
and
sending
ambassadors
to
the
pope
to
exculpate
himself
fearing
an
excommunication
and
an
interdict
he
swore
on
the
gospel
in
one
of
the
norman
cathedrals
that
he
had
not
commanded

to

at

knights

the

desired
amid
the
calamities
which
saddened
his
latter
days
he
felt
that
all
were
the
judgments
of
god
for
his
persecution
of
the
martyr
and
did
penance
at
his
tomb
so
becket
slew
more
by
his
death
than
he
did
by
his
life
his
cause
was
gained
by
his
blood
it
arrested
the
encroachments
of
the
norman
kings
for
more
than
three
hundred
years
he
gained
the
gratitude
of
the
church
and
a
martyr
crown
he
was
canonized
as
a
saint
his
shrine
was
enriched
with
princely
offerings
beyond
any
other
object
of
popular
veneration
in
the
middle
ages
till
the
time
of
the
reformation
a
pilgrimage
to
that
shrine
was
a
common
form
of
penance
for
people
of
all
conditions
and
was
supposed
to
expiate
their
sins
even
miracles
were
reputed
to
be
wrought
at
that
shrine
while
a
drop
of
becket
blood
would
purchase
a
domain
whatever
may
be
said
about
the
cause
of
becket
to
which
there
are
two
sides
there
is
no
doubt
about
his
popularity
even
the
reformation
and
the
changes
made
in
the
english
constitution
have
not
obliterated
the
veneration
in
which
he
was
held
for
five
hundred
years
you
can
not
destroy
respect
for
a
man
who
is
willing
to
be
a
martyr
whether
his
cause
is
right
or
wrong
if
enlightened
judgments
declare
that
he
was
a
martyr
of
sacerdotal
power
not
of
christianity
of
a
caste
and
not
of
mankind
that
he
struggled
for
the
authority
and
privileges
of
the
clergy
rather
than
for
the
good
of
his
country
still
it
will
be
conceded
that
he
fought
bravely
and
died
with
dignity
all
people
love
heroism
they
are
inclined
to
worship
heroes
and
especially
when
an
unarmed
priest
dares
to
resist
an
unscrupulous
and
rapacious
king
as
henry
is
well
known
to
have
been
and
succeeds
in
tearing
from
his
hands
the
spoils
he
has
seized
there
must
be
admiration
you
can
not
extinguish
the
tribute
of
the
soul
for
heroism
any
more
than
that
of
the
mind
for
genius
the
historian
who
seeks
to
pull
down
a
hero
from
the
pedestal
on
which
he
has
been
seated
for
ages
plays
a
losing
game
no
brilliancy
in
sophistical
pleadings
can
make
men
long
prefer
what
is
to
that
which
is
becket
is
enshrined
in
the
hearts
of
his
countrymen
even
as
cromwell
is
among
the
descendants
of
the
puritans
and
substantially
for
the
same
reason
because
they
both
fought
bravely
for
their
respective
causes
the
cause
of
the
people
in
their
respective
ages
both
recognized
god
almighty
and
both
contended
against
the
despotism
of
kings
seeking
to
be
absolute
and
in
behalf
of
the
people
who
were
ground
down
by
military
power
in
the
twelfth
century
the
people
looked
up
to
the
clergy
as
their
deliverers
and
friends
in
the
seventeenth
century
to
parliaments
and
lawyers
becket
was
the
champion
of
the
clergy
even
as
cromwell
was
the
champion
at
least
at
first
of
the
parliament
carlyle
eulogizes
cromwell
as
much
as
froude
abuses
becket
but
becket
if
more
haughty
and
repulsive
than
cromwell
in
his
private
character
yet
was
truer
to
his
principles
he
was
a
great
hero
faithful
to
a
great
cause
as
he
regarded
it
however
averse
this
age
may
justly
be
to
priestly
domination
he
must
be
judged
by
the
standard
which
good
and
enlightened
people
adopted
seven
hundred
years
ago
not
in
england
alone
but
throughout
the
continent
of
europe
this
is
not
the
standard
which
reason
accepts
i
grant
but
it
is
the
standard
by
which
becket
must
be
judged
even
as
the
standard
which
justified
the
encroachments
of

the

the

about
there
is
no

character
with
whom
feudalism
is

it
was
an
institution
of
the

ages
which
grew
out
of
the
miseries
and
robberies
that
succeeded
the
fall
of
the

i
would
call
your
attention
to
political
anarchies
ending
in
political
degradation
to
an
unformed
state
of
society
to
with
its
characteristic
vices
of
plunder
rapine
oppression
and
injustice
to
wild
and
violent
passions
unchecked
by
law
to
the
absence
of

nobles
to
the
miseries
of
the
people
ground
down
ignorant
and
brutal
to
rude
agricultural
life
to
petty
wars
to
general
ignorance
which
kept
society
in
darkness
and
gloom
for
a
thousand
years
all
growing
out
of
the
eclipse
of
the
old
civilization
so
that
the
european
nations
began
a
new
existence
and
toiled
in
sorrow
and
fear
with
few
ameliorations
an
iron
age
yet
an
age
which
was
not
unfavorable
for
the
development
of
new
virtues
and
heroic
qualities
under
the
influence
of
which
society
emerged
from
barbarism
with
a
new
foundation
for
national
greatness
and
a
new
material
for
christianity
and
art
and
literature
and
science
to
work
upon
such
was
the
state
of
society
during
the
existence
of
feudal
institutions
a
period
of
about
five
hundred
years
dating
from
the
dismemberment
of
charlemagne
empire
to
the
fifteenth
century
the
era
of
its
greatest
power
was
from
the
norman
conquest
of
england
to
the
reign
of
edward
iii
but
there
was
a
long
and
gloomy
period
before
feudalism
ripened
into
an
institution
from
the
dissolution
of
the
roman
empire
to
the
eighth
and
ninth
centuries
i
would
assign
this
period
as
the
darkest
and
the
dreariest
in
the
history
of
europe
since
the
roman
conquests
for
this
reason
that
civilization
perished
without
any
one
to
chronicle
the
changes
or
to
take
notice
of
the
extinction
from
charlemagne
there
had
been
with
the
exception
of
brief
intervals
the
birth
of
new
ideas
and
interests
the
growth
of
a
new
civilization
before
his
day
there
was
a
progressive
decline
art
literature
science
alike
faded
away
there
were
no
grand
monuments
erected
the
voice
of
the
poet
was
unheard
in
the
universal
wretchedness
the
monks
completed
the
destruction
which
the
barbarians
began
why
were
libraries
burned
or
destroyed
why
was
classic
literature
utterly
neglected
why
did
no
great
scholars
arise
even
in
the
church
the
new
races
looked
in
vain
for
benefactors
even
the
souvenirs
of
the
old
empire
were
lost
nearly
all
the
records
of
ancient
greatness
perished
the
old
cities
were
levelled
to
the
ground
nothing
was
built
but
monasteries
and
these
were
as
gloomy
as
feudal
castles
at
a
later
date
the
churches
were
heavy
and
mournful
good
men
hid
themselves
trying
to
escape
from
the
miserable
world
and
sang
monotonous
chants
of
death
and
the
grave
agriculture
was
at
the
lowest
state
and
hunting
piracy
and
robbery
were
resorted
to
as
a
means
of
precarious
existence
there
was
no
commerce
the
roads
were
invested
with
vagabonds
and
robbers
it
was
the
era
of
universal
pillage
and
destruction
nothing
was
sacred
universal
desolation
filled
the
souls
of
men
with
despair
what
state
of
society
could
be
worse
than
that
of
england
under
the
early
saxon
kings
there
were
no
dominant
races
and
no
central
power
the
countries
of
europe
relapsed
into
a
sullen
barbarism
i
see
no
bright
spot
anywhere
not
even
in
italy
which
was
at
this
time
the
most
overrun
and
the
most
mercilessly
plundered
of
all
the
provinces
of
the
fallen
empire
the
old
capital
of
the
world
was
nearly
depopulated
nothing
was
spared
of
ancient
art
on
which
the
barbarians
could
lay
their
hands
and
nothing
was
valued
this
was
the
period
of
what
writers
call
tenure
in
distinction
from
feudal
the
allodialist
owned
indeed
his
lands
but
they
were
subject
to
incessant
depredations
from
wandering
tribes
of
barbarians
and
from
robbers
there
was
no
encouragement
to
till
the
soil
there
was
no
incentive
to
industry
of
any
kind
during
a
reign
of
universal
lawlessness
what
man
would
work
except
for
a
scanty
and
precarious
support
his
cattle
might
be
driven
away
his
crops
seized
his
house
plundered
it
is
hard
to
realize
that
our
remote
ancestors
were
mere
barbarians
who
by
the
force
of
numbers
overran
the
world
they
seem
to
have
had
but
one
class
of
virtues
of
death
and
the
willing
sacrifice
of
their
lives
in
battle
the
allodialist
however
was
not
a
barbaric
warrior
or
chieftain
but
the
despoiled
owner
of
lands
that
his
ancestors
had
once
cultivated
in
peace
and
prosperity
he
was
the
degenerate
descendant
of
celtic
and
roman
citizens
the
victim
of
barbaric
spoliations
his
lands
may
have
passed
into
the
hands
of
the
gothic
conquerors
but
the
gothic
or
burgundian
or
frankish
possessor
of
innumerable
acres
once
tilled
by
peaceful
citizens
remained
an
allodial
proprietor
even
he
had
no
protection
and
no
safety
for
any
new
excursion
of
less
fortunate
barbarians
would
desolate
his
possessions
and
decimate
his
laborers
the
small
proprietor
was
especially
subject
to
pillage
and
murder
in
the
universal
despair
from
this
reign
of
anarchy
and
lawlessness
when
there
was
no
security
to
property
and
no
redress
of
evils
the
allodialist
parted
with
his
lands
to
some
powerful
chieftain
and
obtained
promise
of
protection
he
even
resigned
the
privilege
of
freedom
to
save
his
wretched
life
he
became
a
serf
a
chained
to
the
soil
but
protected
from
outrage
nothing
but
inconceivable
miseries
which
have
not
been
painted
by
historians
can
account
for
the
almost
simultaneous
change
in
the
ownership
of
land
in
all
european
countries
we
can
conceive
of
nothing
but
blank
despair
among
the
people
who
attempted
to
cultivate
land
and
there
must
have
been
the
grossest
ignorance
and
the
lowest
degradation
when
men
were
willing
to
submit
to
the
curtailment
of
personal
freedom
and
the
loss
of
their
lands
in
order
to
find
protectors
thus
feudalism
arose
in
the
ninth
and
tenth
centuries
from
the
absolute
wreck
of
property
and
hopes
it
was
virtually
the
surrender
of
land
for
the
promise
of
protection
it
was
the
great
necessity
of
that
anarchical
age
like
all
institutions
it
grew
out
of
the
needs
of
the
times
yet
its
universal
acceptance
seems
to
prove
that
the
change
was
beneficial
feudalism
especially
in
its
early
ages
is
not
to
be
judged
by
the
institutions
of
our
times
any
more
than
is
the
enormous
growth
of
spiritual
power
which
took
place
when
this
social
and
political
revolution
was
going
on
wars
and
devastations
and
untold
calamities
and
brutal
forces
were
the
natural
sequence
of
barbaric
invasions
and
of
the
progressive
fall
of
the
old
civilization
continued
from
generation
to
generation
for
a
period
of
two
or
three
hundred
years
with
scarcely
any
interruption
you
get
no
relief
from
such
a
dispensation
of
divine
providence
unless
you
can
solve
the
question
why
the
roman
empire
was
permitted
to
be
swept
away
if
it
must
be
destroyed
from
the
prevalence
of
the
same
vices
which
have
uniformly
undermined
all
empires
utter
and
unspeakable
rottenness
and
depravity
in
spite
of
christianity
whether
nominal
or
real
if
eternal
justice
must
bear
sway
on
this
earth
bringing
its
fearful
retributions
for
the
abuse
of
privileges
and
general
wickedness
then
we
accept
the
natural
effects
of
that
violence
which
consummated
the
ruin
the
natural
consequences
of
two
hundred
years
of
pillage
and
warfare
and
destruction
of
ancient
institutions
were
and
could
have
been
nothing
other
than
miseries
misrule
sufferings
poverty
insecurity
and
despair
a
universal
conflagration
must
destroy
everything
that
past
ages
had
valued
as
a
relief
from
what
was
felt
to
be
intolerable
and
by
men
who
were
brutal
ignorant
superstitious
and
degraded
all
from
the
effect
of
the
necessary
evils
which
war
creates
a
sort
of
was
felt
to
be
preferable
as
the
price
of
dependence
and
protection
dependence
and
protection
are
the
elemental
principles
of
feudalism
these
were
the
hard
necessities
which
the
age
demanded
and
for
three
hundred
years
it
can
not
be
doubted
the
relation
between
master
and
serf
was
beneficial
it
resulted
in
a
more
peaceful
state
of
society
not
free
from
great
evils
but
still
a
healthful
change
from
the
disorders
of
the
preceding
epoch
the
peasant
could
cultivate
his
land
comparatively
free
from
molestation
he
was
still
poor
sometimes
he
was
exposed
to
heavy
exactions
he
was
bound
to
give
a
portion
of
the
profits
of
his
land
to
his
lordly
proprietor
and
he
was
bound
to
render
services
in
war
but
as
he
was
not
bound
to
serve
over
forty
days
he
was
not
led
on
distant
expeditions
he
was
not
carried
far
from
home
he
was
not
exposed
to
the
ambition
of
military
leaders
his
warlike
services
seem
to
be
confined
to
the
protection
of
his
master
castle
and
family
or
to
the
assault
of
some
neighboring
castle
he
was
simply
made
to
participate
in
baronial
quarrels
and
as
these
quarrels
were
frequent
his
life
was
not
altogether
peaceful
but
war
on
a
large
scale
was
impossible
in
the
feudal
age
the
military
glory
of
the
roman
conquerors
was
unknown
and
also
that
of
modern
european
monarchs
the
peasant
was
bound
to
serve
under
the
banner
of
a
military
chieftain
only
for
a
short
time
then
he
returned
to
his
farm
his
great
military
weapon
was
the
bow
the
weapon
of
the
spear
the
sword
the
were
the
weapons
of
the
baronial
family
the
weapons
of
knights
who
fought
on
horseback
cased
in
defensive
armor
the
peasant
fought
on
foot
and
as
the
tactics
of
ancient
warfare
were
inapplicable
and
those
of
modern
warfare
unknown
the
strength
of
armies
was
in
cavalry
and
not
in
the
infantry
as
in
modern
times
but
armies
were
not
large
from
the
ninth
to
the
twelfth
century
not
until
the
crusades
arose
nor
were
they
subject
to
a
rigid
discipline
they
were
simply
an
armed
rabble
they
were
more
like
militia
than
regular
forces
they
fostered
military
virtues
without
the
demoralization
of
standing
armies
in
the
feudal
age
there
were
no
standing
armies
even
at
so
late
a
period
as
the
time
of
queen
elizabeth
that
sovereign
had
to
depend
on
the
militia
for
the
defence
of
the
realm
against
the
spaniards
standing
armies
are
the
invention
of
great
military
monarchs
or
a
great
military
state
the
bow
and
arrow
were
used
equally
to
shoot
men
and
shoot
deer
but
they
rarely
penetrated
the
armor
of
knights
or
their
force
was
broken
by
the
heavy
shield
they
took
effect
only
on
the
undefended
bodies
of
the
peasantry
hence
there
was
a
great
disproportion
of
the
slain
in
battle
between
peasants
and
their
mounted
masters
war
even
when
confined
to
a
small
sphere
has
its
terrors
the
sufferers
were
the
common
people
whose
lives
were
not
held
of
much
account
history
largely
confines
itself
to
battles
hence
we
are
apt
to
lose
sight
of
the
uneventful
life
of
the
people
in
quiet
times
but
the
barons
were
not
always
fighting
in
the
intervals
of
war
the
peasant
enjoyed
the
rude
pleasures
of
his
home
he
grew
up
with
strong
attachments
having
no
desire
to
migrate
or
travel
gradually
the
sentiment
of
loyalty
was
born
loyalty
to
his
master
and
to
his
country
his
life
was
rough
but
earnest
he
had
great
simplicity
of
character
he
became
honest
industrious
and
frugal
he
was
contented
with
but
few
pleasures
rural
f√™tes
and
village
holidays
he
had
no
luxuries
and
no
craving
for
them
measured
by
our
modern
scale
of
pleasures
he
led
a
very
inglorious
unambitious
and
rude
life
contentment
is
one
of
the
mysteries
of
existence
we
should
naturally
think
that
excitement
and
pleasure
and
knowledge
would
make
people
happy
since
they
stimulate
the
intellectual
powers
but
on
the
contrary
they
seem
to
produce
unrest
and
cravings
which
are
never
satisfied
and
we
should
naturally
think
that
a
life
of
isolation
especially
with
no
mental
resources
a
hard
rural
existence
with
but
few
comforts
and
no
luxuries
would
make
people
discontented
yet
it
does
not
seem
to
be
so
in
fact
as
illustrated
by
the
apparent
contentment
of
people
doomed
to
hard
labor
in
the
most
retired
and
dreary
retreats
we
wonder
at
their
placitude
as
we
travel
in
remote
and
obscure
sections
of
the
country
a
poor
farmer
whose
house
is
scarcely
better
than
a
hovel
surrounded
with
chickens
and
pigs
and
with
only
a
small
garden
unadorned
and
lonely
and
repulsive
has
no
cravings
which
make
the
life
of
the
favored
rich
sometimes
unendurable
the
poorer
he
is
and
therefore
the
more
miserable
as
we
should
think
the
more
contented
he
seems
to
be
while
a
fashionable
woman
or
man
both
accustomed
to
the
luxuries
and
follies
of
city
life
with
all
its
refinements
and
gratification
of
intellectual
and
social
pleasures
will
sometimes
pine
in
a
suburban
home
with
all
the
gilded
glories
of
rich
furniture
books
beautiful
gardens
greenhouses
luxurious
living
horses
carriages
and
everything
that
wealth
can
furnish
so
that
civilization
would
seem
often
a
bitter
mockery
showing
that
intellectual
life
only
stimulates
the
cravings
of
the
soul
but
does
not
satisfy
them
and
when
people
are
poor
but
cultivated
the
unhappiness
seems
to
be
still
greater
demonstrating
that
cultivated
intellect
alone
opens
to
the
mind
the
existence
of
evils
which
are
intensified
by
the
difficulty
of
their
removal
and
on
which
the
mind
dwells
with
feelings
kindred
to
despair
i
have
sometimes
doubted
whether
an
obscure
daughter
is
any
happier
with
her
piano
and
her
piles
of
cheaply
illustrated
literature
and
translations
of
french
novels
and
her
smatterings
of
science
learned
in
normal
schools
since
she
has
learned
too
often
to
despise
her
father
and
mother
and
brother
and
her
uneducated
rural
beau
and
all
her
surroundings
with
poverty
and
unrest
and
aspiration
for
society
eating
out
her
soul
the
happiness
produced
merely
by
intellectual
pleasures
and
social
frivolities
is
very
small
at
the
best
compared
with
that
produced
by
the
virtues
of
the
heart
and
the
affections
kindled
by
deeds
of
devotion
or
the
duties
which
take
the
mind
from
itself
intellectual
pleasures
give
only
a
brief
satisfaction
unless
directed
to
a
practical
end
like
the
earnest
imparting
of
knowledge
in
educational
pursuits
or
the
pursuit
of
art
for
itself
alone
to
create
and
not
to
devour
as
the
epicure
eats
his
dinner
where
is
the
happiness
of
devouring
books
with
no
attempt
to
profit
by
them
except
in
the
temporary
pleasure
of
satisfying
an
appetite
so
even
the
highest
means
of
happiness
may
become
a
savor
of
death
unto
death
when
perverted
or
unimproved
never
should
we
stimulate
the
intellect
merely
to
feed
upon
itself
unless
intellectual
culture
is
directed
to
what
is
useful
especially
to
the
necessities
or
improvement
of
others
it
is
a
delusion
and
a
snare
better
far
to
be
ignorant
but
industrious
and
useful
in
any
calling
however
humble
than
to
cram
the
mind
with
knowledge
that
leads
to
no
good
practical
result
the
buxom
maiden
of
rural
life
in
former
days
absorbed
in
the
duties
of
home
with
no
knowledge
except
that
gained
in
a
district
school
in
the
winter
with
all
her
genial
humanities
in
the
society
of
equals
no
more
aspiring
than
herself
is
to
me
a
far
more
interesting
person
than
the
languid
discontented
envious
girl
who
has
just
returned
from
a
school
beyond
her
father
means
even
if
she
can
play
upon
an
instrument
and
has
worn
herself
thin
in
exhausting
studies
under
the
stimulus
of
ambitious
competition
or
the
harangues
of
a
pedant
who
thinks
what
he
calls
education
to
be
the
end
of
life
an
education
which
reveals
her
own
insignificance
or
leads
her
to
strive
for
an
unattainable
position
i
am
forced
to
make
these
remarks
to
show
that
the
mediaeval
peasant
was
not
necessarily
miserable
because
he
was
ignorant
or
isolated
or
poor
in
so
doing
i
may
excite
the
wrath
of
some
who
think
a
little
knowledge
is
a
dangerous
thing
and
may
appear
to
be
throwing
cold
water
on
one
of
the
noblest
endeavors
of
modern
times
but
i
do
not
sneer
at
education
i
only
seek
to
show
that
it
will
not
make
people
happy
unless
it
is
directed
into
useful
channels
and
that
even
ignorance
may
be
bliss
when
it
is
folly
to
be
wise
a
benevolent
providence
tempers
all
conditions
to
the
necessities
of
the
times
the
peasantry
of
europe
became
earnest
and
stalwart
warriors
and
farmers
even
under
the
grinding
despotism
of
feudal
masters
with
their
beer
and
brown
bread
and
a
fowl
in
the
pot
on
a
sunday
they
grew
up
to
be
hardy
bold
strong
healthy
and
industrious
they
furnished
a
material
on
which
christianity
and
a
future
civilization
could
work
they
became
patriotic
religious
and
they
learned
to
bear
their
evils
in
patience
they
were
more
cheerful
than
the
laboring
classes
of
our
day
with
their
partial
education
although
we
may
console
ourselves
with
the
reflection
that
these
are
passing
through
the
fermenting
processes
of
a
transition
from
a
lower
to
a
higher
grade
of
living
look
at
the
picture
of
them
which
art
has
handed
down
their
faces
are
ruddy
genial
sympathetic
although
coarse
and
vulgar
and
boorish
and
they
learned
to
accept
the
inequalities
of
life
without
repining
insolence
they
were
humble
and
felt
that
there
were
actually
some
people
in
the
world
superior
to
themselves
i
do
not
paint
their
condition
as
desirable
or
interesting
by
our
standard
but
as
endurable
they
were
doubtless
very
ignorant
but
would
knowledge
have
made
them
any
happier
knowledge
is
for
those
who
can
climb
by
it
to
positions
of
honor
and
usefulness
not
for
those
who
can
not
rise
above
the
condition
in
which
they
were
born
not
for
those
who
will
be
snubbed
and
humiliated
and
put
down
by
arrogant
wealth
and
birth
better
be
unconscious
of
suffering
than
conscious
of
wrongs
which
can
not
be
redressed
let
no
one
here
misunderstand
and
pervert
me
i
am
not
exalting
the
ignorance
and
brutality
of
the
feudal
ages
i
am
not
decrying
the
superior
advantages
of
our
modern
times
i
only
state
that
ignorance
and
brutality
were
the
necessary
sequences
of
the
wars
and
disorders
of
a
preceding
epoch
but
that
this
very
ignorance
and
brutality
were
accompanied
by
virtues
which
partially
ameliorated
the
evils
of
the
day
that
in
the
despair
of
slavery
were
the
hopes
of
future
happiness
that
religion
took
a
deep
hold
of
the
human
mind
even
though
blended
with
puerile
and
degrading
superstitions
that
christianity
taking
hold
of
the
hearts
of
a
suffering
people
taught
lessons
which
enabled
them
to
bear
their
hardships
with
resignation
that
cheerfulness
was
not
extinguished
and
that
so
many
virtues
were
generated
by
the
combined
influence
of
suffering
and
christianity
that
even
with
ignorance
human
nature
shone
with
greater
lustre
than
among
those
by
whom
knowledge
is
perverted
it
was
not
until
the
evil
and
injustice
of
feudalism
were
exposed
by
political
writers
and
were
meditated
upon
by
the
people
who
had
arisen
by
education
and
knowledge
that
they
became
unendurable
and
then
the
people
shook
off
the
yoke
but
how
impossible
would
have
been
a
french
revolution
in
the
thirteenth
century
what
readers
would
a
rousseau
have
found
among
the
people
in
the
time
of
louis
if
knowledge
breaks
fetters
when
the
people
are
strong
enough
to
shake
them
off
ignorance
enables
them
to
bear
those
fetters
when
emancipation
is
impossible
the
great
empire
of
charlemagne
was
divided
at
his
death
in
among
his
three
sons
one
of
whom
had
france
another
italy
and
the
third
germany
in
years
afterwards
we
find
seven
kingdoms
instead
of
three
france
navarre
provence
burgundy
lorraine
germany
and
italy
in
a
few
years
more
there
were
hereditary
fiefs
and
as
early
as
the
tenth
century
france
itself
was
split
up
into
independent
sovereignties
and
these
small
sovereignties
were
again
divided
into
dukedoms
and
baronies
all
these
dukes
and
barons
however
acknowledged
the
king
of
france
as
their
liege
lord
yet
he
was
not
richer
or
more
powerful
than
some
of
the
dukes
who
swore
fealty
to
him
the
duke
of
burgundy
at
one
time
had
larger
territories
and
more
power
than
the
king
of
france
himself
so
that
the
central
authority
of
kings
was
merely
nominal
their
power
extended
scarcely
beyond
the
lands
they
individually
controlled
and
all
the
countries
of
europe
were
equally
ruled
by
petty
kings
the
kings
of
england
seem
to
have
centralized
around
their
thrones
more
power
than
other
european
monarchs
until
the
time
of
the
crusades
when
they
were
checked
not
so
much
by
nobles
as
by
act
of
parliament
now
all
europe
was
virtually
divided
among
these
petty
sovereigns
called
dukes
earls
counts
and
barons
each
one
was
virtually
independent
he
coined
money
administered
justice
and
preserved
order
he
ruled
by
hereditary
right
and
his
estate
descended
to
his
oldest
son
his
revenues
were
derived
by
the
extorted
contributions
of
those
who
cultivated
his
lands
and
by
certain
perquisites
among
which
were
the
privilege
of
wardship
and
the
profits
of
an
estate
during
the
minority
of
its
possessor
and
reliefs
or
fines
paid
on
the
alienation
of
a
vassal
feud
and
the
lord
could
bestow
a
female
ward
in
marriage
on
whomever
he
pleased
and
on
her
refusal
take
possession
of
her
estate
these
lordly
proprietors
of
great
estates
or
nobles
so
powerful
and
independent
lived
in
castles
these
strongholds
were
necessary
in
such
turbulent
times
they
were
large
or
small
according
to
the
wealth
or
rank
of
the
nobles
who
occupied
them
but
of
no
architectural
beauty
they
were
fortresses
generally
built
on
hills
or
cragged
rocks
or
in
inaccessible
marshes
or
on
islands
in
rivers
anywhere
where
defence
was
easiest
the
nobles
did
not
think
of
beautiful
situations
or
fruitful
meadows
so
much
as
of
the
safety
and
independence
of
the
feudal
family
they
therefore
lived
in
great
isolation
travelling
but
little
and
only
at
short
distances
it
was
the
higher
clergy
only
who
travelled
though
born
to
rank
and
power
they
were
yet
rude
rough
unpolished
they
were
warriors
they
fought
on
horseback
covered
with
defensive
armor
they
were
greedy
and
quarrelsome
and
hence
were
engaged
in
perpetual
strife
in
the
assault
on
castles
and
devastation
of
lands
these
castles
were
generally
gloomy
heavy
and
uncomfortable
yet
were
very
numerous
in
the
eleventh
and
twelfth
centuries
they
were
occupied
by
the
feudal
family
perhaps
the
chaplain
strangers
of
rank
bards
minstrels
and
servants
who
lived
on
the
best
the
country
afforded
but
without
the
luxuries
of
our
times
they
lived
better
than
the
monks
as
they
had
no
vows
to
restrain
them
but
in
their
dreary
castles
the
rooms
were
necessarily
small
dark
and
damp
except
the
banqueting
hall
they
were
poorly
lighted
there
being
no
glass
in
the
narrow
windows
nor
chimneys
nor
carpets
nor
mirrors
nor
luxurious
furniture
nor
crockery
nor
glassware
nor
stoves
nor
the
refinements
of
cookery
the
few
roads
of
the
country
were
travelled
only
by
horsemen
or
people
on
foot
there
were
no
carriages
only
a
few
heavy
lumbering
wagons
tea
and
coffee
were
unknown
as
also
tropical
fruits
and
some
of
our
best
vegetables
but
game
of
all
kinds
was
plenty
and
cheap
so
also
were
wine
and
beer
and
beef
and
mutton
and
pork
and
poultry
the
feudal
family
was
illiterate
and
read
but
few
books
the
chief
pleasures
were
those
of
the
chase
hunting
and
hawking
and
intemperate
feasts
what
we
call
society
was
impossible
although
the
barons
may
have
exchanged
visits
with
each
other
they
rarely
visited
cities
which
at
that
time
were
small
and
uninteresting
the
lordly
proprietor
of
ten
thousand
acres
may
have
been
jolly
frank
and
convivial
but
he
was
still
rough
and
had
little
to
say
on
matters
of
great
interests
circumscribed
he
was
of
necessity
ignorant
and
prejudiced
conscious
of
power
however
he
was
proud
and
insolent
to
inferiors
he
was
merely
a
physical
man
ruddy
healthy
strong
indeed
but
without
refinement
or
knowledge
or
social
graces
his
castle
was
a
fort
and
not
a
palace
and
here
he
lived
with
boisterous
or
sullen
companions
as
rough
and
ignorant
as
himself
his
wife
and
daughters
were
more
interesting
but
without
those
attainments
which
grace
and
adorn
society
they
made
tapestries
and
embroideries
and
rode
horseback
and
danced
well
and
were
virtuous
but
were
primitive
uneducated
and
supercilious
their
beauty
was
of
the
ruddy
sort
physical
but
genial
they
were
very
fond
of
ornaments
and
gay
dresses
and
so
were
their
lords
on
festive
occasions
for
delights
in
what
is
showy
and
glittering
purple
and
feathers
and
trinkets
feudalism
was
intensely
aristocratic
a
line
was
drawn
between
the
noble
and
ignoble
classes
almost
as
broad
as
that
which
separates
liberty
from
slavery
it
was
next
to
impossible
for
a
peasant
or
artisan
or
even
a
merchant
to
pass
that
line
the
exclusiveness
of
the
noble
class
was
intolerable
it
held
in
scorn
any
profession
but
arms
neither
riches
nor
learning
was
of
any
account
it
gloried
in
the
pride
of
birth
and
nourished
a
haughty
scorn
of
plebeian
prosperity
it
was
not
until
cities
and
arts
and
commerce
arose
that
the
arrogance
of
the
baron
was
rebuked
or
his
iron
power
broken
haughty
though
ignorant
he
had
no
pity
or
compassion
for
the
poor
and
miserable
his
peasantry
were
doomed
to
perpetual
insults
their
cornfields
were
trodden
down
by
the
baronial
hunters
they
were
compelled
even
to
grind
their
corn
in
the
landlord
mill
and
bake
their
bread
in
his
oven
they
had
no
redress
of
injuries
and
were
scorned
as
well
as
insulted
what
knight
would
arm
himself
for
them
what
gentle
lady
wept
at
their
sorrows
the
feeling
of
personal
consequence
was
entirely
confined
to
the
feudal
family
the
poorest
knight
took
precedence
over
the
richest
merchant
pride
of
birth
was
carried
to
romantic
extravagance
so
that
marriages
seldom
took
place
between
different
classes
a
beautiful
peasant
girl
could
never
rise
above
her
drudgeries
and
she
never
dreamed
of
rising
for
the
members
of
the
baronial
family
were
looked
up
to
as
superior
beings
a
caste
grew
up
as
rigid
and
exclusive
as
that
of
india
the
noble
and
ignoble
classes
were
not
connected
by
any
ties
there
was
nothing
in
common
between
them
even
the
glory
of
successful
warfare
shed
no
radiance
on
a
peasant
hut
he
fought
for
his
master
and
not
for
himself
and
scarcely
for
his
country
he
belonged
to
his
master
as
completely
as
if
he
could
be
bought
and
sold
christianity
teaches
the
idea
of
a
universal
brotherhood
feudalism
suppressed
or
extinguished
it
peasants
had
no
rights
only
duties
and
duties
to
hard
and
unsympathetic
masters
can
we
wonder
that
a
relation
so
unequal
should
have
been
detested
by
the
people
when
they
began
to
think
can
we
wonder
it
should
have
created
french
revolutions
when
we
remember
how
the
people
toiled
for
a
warrior
how
they
fought
for
his
interests
how
they
died
for
his
renown
how
they
were
curtailed
in
their
few
pleasures
how
they
were
not
permitted
even
to
shoot
a
pheasant
or
hare
in
their
own
grounds
we
are
amazed
that
such
signal
injustice
should
ever
have
been
endured
it
is
impossible
that
this
injustice
should
not
have
been
felt
and
no
man
ever
became
reconciled
to
injustice
unless
reduced
to
the
condition
of
a
brute
religious
tyranny
may
be
borne
for
the
priest
invokes
a
supreme
authority
which
all
feel
to
be
universally
binding
but
all
tyranny
over
the
body
the
utter
extinction
of
liberty
is
hateful
even
to
the
most
degraded
hottentot
why
then
was
such
an
unjust
and
unequal
relation
permitted
to
exist
so
long
what
good
did
it
accomplish
what
were
its
extenuating
features
why
was
it
commended
by
historians
as
a
good
institution
for
the
times
it
created
a
hardy
agricultural
class
inured
them
to
the
dangers
and
the
toils
of
war
bound
them
by
local
attachments
and
fostered
a
patriotic
spirit
it
developed
the
virtues
of
obedience
and
submission
to
evils
it
created
a
love
of
home
and
household
duties
it
was
favorable
to
female
virtue
it
created
the
stout
yeomanry
who
could
be
relied
upon
in
danger
it
made
law
and
order
possible
it
defended
the
people
from
robbers
it
laid
a
foundation
for
warlike
prowess
it
was
favorable
to
growth
of
population
for
war
did
not
sweep
off
the
people
so
much
as
those
dire
plagues
and
pestilences
which
were
common
in
the
middle
ages
it
was
preferable
to
the
disorders
and
conflagrations
and
depredations
of
preceding
times
the
poor
man
was
oppressed
but
he
was
safe
so
long
as
his
lord
could
protect
him
it
was
a
hard
discipline
but
a
discipline
which
was
healthy
it
preserved
the
seed
if
it
did
not
bear
the
fruits
of
civilization
the
peasantry
became
honest
earnest
sincere
they
were
made
susceptible
of
religious
impressions
they
became
attached
to
all
the
institutions
of
the
church
the
parish
church
was
their
retreat
their
consolation
and
their
joy
the
priest
tyrannized
over
the
soul
and
the
knight
over
the
body
but
the
flame
of
piety
burned
steadily
and
warmly
when
the
need
of
such
an
institution
as
feudalism
no
longer
existed
then
it
was
broken
up
its
blessings
were
not
commensurate
with
its
evils
but
the
evils
were
less
than
those
which
previously
existed
this
is
i
grant
but
faint
praise
but
the
progress
of
society
could
not
be
rapid
amid
such
universal
ignorance
it
is
slow
in
the
best
of
times
i
do
not
call
that
state
of
society
progressive
where
moral
and
spiritual
truths
are
forgotten
or
disregarded
in
the
triumphs
of
a
brilliant
material
life
there
was
no
progress
of
society
from
the
antonines
to
theodosius
but
a
steady
decline
but
there
was
a
progress
however
slow
from
charlemagne
to
philip
augustus
but
for
feudalism
and
ecclesiastical
institutions
the
european
races
might
not
have
emerged
from
anarchy
or
might
have
been
subjected
to
a
new
and
withering
imperialism
say
what
we
will
of
the
grinding
despotism
of
feudalism
and
we
can
not
be
too
severe
on
any
form
of
despotism
yet
the
rude
barbarian
became
a
citizen
in
process
of
time
with
education
and
political
rights
society
made
the
same
sort
of
advance
in
the
gloomy
epoch
we
are
reviewing
that
the
slaves
in
our
southern
states
made
from
the
time
they
were
imported
from
africa
with
their
degrading
fetichism
and
unexampled
ignorance
to
the
time
of
their
emancipation
how
marked
the
progress
of
the
southern
slaves
during
the
two
hundred
years
of
their
bondage
no
degraded
race
ever
made
so
marked
a
progress
as
they
did
in
the
same
period
even
under
all
the
withering
influences
of
slavery
probably
their
moral
and
spiritual
progress
was
greater
than
it
will
be
in
the
next
two
hundred
years
exposed
to
all
the
dangers
of
modern
materialism
which
saps
the
life
of
nations
in
the
midst
of
the
most
brilliant
triumphs
of
art
we
are
now
on
the
road
to
a
marvellous
intellectual
enlightenment
unprecedented
and
full
of
encouragement
but
with
this
we
face
dangers
also
such
as
undermined
the
old
roman
world
and
all
the
ancient
civilizations
if
i
could
fix
my
eye
on
a
single
state
or
nation
in
the
whole
history
of
our
humanity
that
has
escaped
these
dangers
that
has
not
retrograded
in
those
virtues
on
which
the
strength
of
man
is
based
after
a
certain
point
has
been
reached
in
civilization
i
would
not
hazard
this
remark
society
escaped
these
evils
in
that
agricultural
period
which
saw
the
rise
and
fall
of
feudalism
and
made
a
slow
but
notable
advance
that
is
a
fact
which
can
not
be
gainsaid
and
this
is
impressive
it
shows
that
society
in
a
moral
point
of
view
thrives
better
under
hard
restraints
than
when
exposed
to
the
dangers
of
an
irreligious
material
civilization
nor
is
feudalism
to
be
condemned
as
being
altogether
dark
and
uninteresting
it
had
redeeming
features
in
the
life
of
the
baronial
family
under
its
influence
arose
the
institution
of
chivalry
and
though
the
virtues
of
chivalry
may
be
poetic
and
exaggerated
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
it
was
a
civilizing
institution
and
partially
redeemed
the
middle
ages
it
gave
rise
to
beautiful
sentiments
it
blazed
in
new
virtues
rarely
seen
in
the
old
civilizations
they
were
peculiar
to
the
age
and
to
europe
were
fostered
by
the
church
and
took
a
coloring
from
christianity
itself
chivalry
bound
together
the
martial
barons
of
europe
by
the
ties
of
a
fraternity
of
knights
those
armed
and
mailed
warriors
fought
on
horseback
and
chivalry
takes
its
name
from
the
french
meaning
a
horse
the
knights
learned
gradually
to
treat
each
other
with
peculiar
courtesy
they
became
generous
in
battle
or
in
misfortune
for
they
all
alike
belonged
to
the
noble
class
and
felt
a
common
bond
in
the
pride
of
birth
it
was
not
the
memory
of
illustrious
ancestors
which
created
this
aristocratic
distinction
as
among
roman
patricians
but
the
fact
that
the
knights
were
a
superior
order
yet
among
themselves
distinctions
vanished
there
was
no
higher
distinction
than
that
of
a
gentleman
the
poorest
knight
was
welcome
at
any
castle
or
at
any
festivity
at
the
tournament
or
in
the
chase
generally
gallantry
and
unblemished
reputation
were
the
conditions
of
social
rank
among
the
knights
themselves
they
were
expected
to
excel
in
courage
in
courtesy
in
generosity
in
truthfulness
in
loyalty
the
great
patrimony
of
the
knight
was
his
horse
his
armor
and
his
valor
he
was
bound
to
succor
the
defenceless
he
was
required
to
abstain
from
all
mean
pursuits
if
his
trade
were
war
he
would
divest
war
of
its
cruelties
his
word
was
seldom
broken
and
his
promises
were
held
sacred
if
pride
of
rank
was
generated
in
this
fraternity
of
gentlemen
so
also
was
scorn
of
lies
and
baseness
if
there
was
no
brotherhood
of
man
there
was
the
brotherhood
of
equals
the
most
beautiful
friendships
arose
from
common
dangers
and
common
duties
a
stranger
knight
was
treated
with
the
greatest
kindness
and
hospitality
if
chivalry
condemned
anything
it
was
selfishness
and
treachery
and
hypocrisy
all
the
old
romances
and
chronicles
record
the
frankness
and
magnanimity
of
knights
more
was
thought
of
moral
than
of
intellectual
excellence
nobody
was
ashamed
to
be
thought
religious
the
mailed
warrior
said
his
orisons
every
day
and
never
neglected
mass
even
in
war
prisoners
were
released
on
their
parole
of
honor
and
their
ransom
was
rarely
exorbitant
the
institution
tended
to
soften
manners
as
well
as
to
develop
the
virtues
of
the
heart
under
its
influence
the
rude
baron
was
transformed
into
a
courteous
gentleman
but
the
distinguishing
glory
of
chivalry
was
devotion
to
the
female
sex
respect
for
woman
was
born
in
the
german
forests
before
the
roman
empire
fell
it
was
the
best
trait
of
the
germanic
barbarians
but
under
the
institution
of
chivalry
this
natural
respect
was
ripened
into
admiration
and
gallantry
love
of
god
and
the
ladies
was
enjoined
as
a
single
duty
the
knight
ever
came
to
the
rescue
of
a
woman
in
danger
or
distress
provided
she
was
a
lady
nothing
is
better
attested
than
the
chivalric
devotion
to
woman
in
a
feudal
castle
the
name
of
a
mistress
of
the
heart
was
never
mentioned
but
in
profound
respect
even
pages
were
required
to
choose
objects
of
devotion
to
whom
they
were
to
be
loyal
unto
death
woman
presided
in
the
feudal
castle
where
she
exercised
a
proper
restraint
she
bestowed
the
prize
of
valor
at
tournaments
and
tilts
to
insult
a
lady
was
a
lasting
disgrace
or
to
reveal
her
secrets
for
the
first
time
in
history
woman
became
the
equal
partner
of
her
husband
she
was
his
companion
often
in
the
chase
gaily
mounted
on
her
steed
she
always
dined
with
him
and
was
the
presiding
genius
of
the
castle
she
was
made
regent
of
kingdoms
heir
of
crowns
and
joint
manager
of
great
estates
she
had
the
supreme
management
of
her
household
and
was
consulted
in
every
matter
of
importance
what
an
insignificant
position
woman
filled
at
athens
compared
with
that
in
the
feudal
castle
how
different
the
estimate
of
woman
among
the
pagan
poets
from
that
held
by
the
proven√ßal
poets
what
a
contrast
to
juvenal
is
sordello
the
lady
of
a
baronial
hall
deemed
it
an
insult
to
be
addressed
in
the
language
of
gallantry
except
in
that
vague
and
poetic
sense
in
which
every
knight
selected
some
lady
as
the
object
of
his
dutiful
devotion
she
disdained
the
attentions
of
the
most
potent
prince
if
his
addresses
were
not
honorable
nor
would
she
bestow
her
love
on
one
of
whom
she
was
not
proud
she
would
not
marry
a
coward
or
a
braggart
even
if
he
were
the
owner
of
ten
thousand
acres
the
knight
was
encouraged
to
pay
his
address
to
any
lady
if
he
was
personally
worthy
of
her
love
for
chivalry
created
a
high
estimate
of
individual
merit
the
feudal
lady
ignored
all
degrees
of
wealth
within
her
own
rank
she
was
as
tender
and
compassionate
as
she
was
heroic
she
was
treated
as
a
superior
rather
than
as
an
equal
there
was
a
poetical
admiration
among
the
whole
circle
of
knights
a
knight
without
an
object
of
devotion
was
as
a
ship
without
a
rudder
a
horse
without
a
bridle
a
sword
without
a
hilt
a
sky
without
a
star
even
a
don
quixote
must
have
his
dulcinea
as
well
as
horse
and
armor
and
squire
dante
impersonates
the
spirit
of
the
middle
ages
in
his
adoration
of
beatrice
the
ancient
poets
coupled
the
praises
of
women
with
the
praises
of
wine
woman
under
the
influence
of
chivalry
became
the
star
of
worship
an
object
of
idolatry
we
read
of
few
divorces
in
the
middle
ages
or
of
separations
or
desertions
or
even
alienations
these
things
are
a
modern
improvement
borrowed
from
the
customs
of
the
romans
the
awe
and
devotion
with
which
the
lover
regarded
his
bride
became
regard
and
affection
in
the
husband
the
matron
maintained
the
rank
which
had
been
assigned
to
her
as
a
maiden
the
gallant
warriors
blended
even
the
adoration
of
our
lord
with
adoration
of
our
lady
the
deification
of
christ
with
the
deification
of
woman
chivalry
encouraged
by
the
church
and
always
strongly
allied
with
religious
sentiments
accepted
for
eternal
veneration
the
transcendent
loveliness
of
the
mother
of
our
lord
so
that
chivalric
veneration
for
the
sex
culminated
in
the
reverence
which
belongs
to
the
queen
of
heaven
fidelis
regina
woman
assumed
among
kings
and
barons
the
importance
which
she
was
supposed
to
have
in
the
celestial
hierarchy
and
besides
the
religious
influence
the
poetic
imagination
of
the
time
seized
upon
this
pure
and
lovely
element
which
passed
into
the
songs
the
tales
the
talk
the
thought
and
the
aspirations
of
all
the
knightly
order
whence
now
this
veneration
for
woman
which
arose
in
the
middle
ages
a
veneration
which
all
historians
attest
such
as
never
existed
in
the
ancient
civilization
it
was
undoubtedly
based
on
the
noble
qualities
and
domestic
virtues
which
feudal
life
engendered
women
were
heroines
queen
philippa
in
the
absence
of
her
husband
stationed
herself
in
the
castle
of
bamborough
and
defied
the
whole
power
of
douglas
the
first
military
dispatch
ever
written
in
the
middle
ages
was
addressed
to
her
she
even
took
david
of
scotland
a
prisoner
when
he
invaded
england
these
women
of
chivalry
were
ready
to
undergo
any
fatigues
to
promote
their
husbands
interests
they
were
equal
to
any
personal
sacrifices
nothing
could
daunt
their
courage
they
could
defend
themselves
in
danger
showing
an
extraordinary
fertility
of
resources
they
earned
the
devotion
they
called
out
what
more
calculated
to
win
the
admiration
of
feudal
warriors
than
this
devotion
and
bravery
on
the
part
of
wives
and
daughters
they
were
helpmates
in
every
sense
they
superintended
the
details
of
castles
they
were
always
employed
and
generally
in
what
were
imperative
duties
if
they
embroidered
dresses
or
worked
tapestries
they
also
wove
the
cloth
for
their
husband
coats
and
made
his
shirts
and
knit
his
stockings
if
they
trained
hawks
and
falcons
they
fed
the
poultry
and
cultivated
the
flowers
they
understood
the
cares
of
the
kitchen
and
managed
the
servants
but
it
was
their
moral
virtues
which
excited
the
greatest
esteem
they
gloried
in
their
unsullied
names
their
characters
were
above
suspicion
any
violation
of
the
marriage
vow
was
almost
unknown
an
unfaithful
wife
was
infamous
the
ordinary
life
of
a
castle
was
that
of
isolation
which
made
women
discreet
and
free
from
entangling
excitements
they
had
no
great
pleasures
and
but
little
society
they
were
absorbed
with
their
duties
and
contented
with
their
love
the
feudal
castle
however
was
not
dull
although
it
was
isolated
and
afforded
few
novelties
it
was
full
of
strangers
and
minstrels
and
bards
and
pedlars
and
priests
women
could
gratify
their
social
wants
without
seductive
excitements
they
led
a
life
favorable
to
friendships
which
can
not
thrive
amid
the
distractions
of
cities
in
cities
few
have
time
to
cultivate
friendships
although
they
may
not
be
extinguished
in
the
baronial
castle
however
they
were
necessary
to
existence
and
here
where
she
was
so
well
known
woman
worth
was
recognized
her
caprices
and
frivolities
were
balanced
by
sterling
qualities
as
a
nurse
in
sickness
as
a
devotee
to
duties
as
a
friend
in
distress
ever
sympathetic
and
kind
she
was
not
exacting
and
required
very
little
to
amuse
her
of
course
she
was
not
intellectual
since
she
read
but
few
books
and
received
only
the
rudiments
of
education
but
she
was
as
learned
as
her
brothers
and
quicker
in
her
wits
she
had
the
vivacity
which
a
healthy
life
secures
nor
was
she
beautiful
according
to
our
standard
she
was
a
ruddy
cheerful
active
healthy
woman
accustomed
to
exercise
in
the
open
air
to
and
horseback
journeys
still
less
was
she
what
we
call
fashionable
for
the
word
was
not
known
nor
was
she
a
woman
of
society
for
as
we
have
said
there
was
no
society
in
a
feudal
castle
what
we
call
society
was
born
in
cities
where
women
reign
by
force
of
mind
and
elegant
courtesies
and
grace
of
manners
where
woman
is
an
ornament
as
well
as
a
power
without
drudgeries
and
almost
without
cares
as
at
the
courts
of
the
bourbon
princes
yet
i
am
not
certain
but
that
the
foundation
of
courtly
elegance
and
dignity
was
laid
in
the
baronial
home
when
woman
began
her
reign
as
the
equal
of
her
wedded
lord
when
she
commanded
reverence
for
her
courtesies
and
friendships
and
when
her
society
was
valued
so
highly
by
aristocratic
knights
in
the
castle
she
became
genial
and
kind
and
sympathetic
although
haughty
to
inferiors
and
hard
on
the
peasantry
she
was
ever
religious
religious
duties
took
up
no
small
part
of
her
time
christianity
raised
her
more
than
all
other
influences
combined
you
never
read
of
an
infidel
woman
when
chivalry
flourished
any
more
than
of
a
woman
the
feudal
woman
never
left
her
sphere
even
amid
the
pleasures
of
the
chase
or
the
tilt
her
gentle
and
domestic
virtues
remained
with
her
to
the
end
and
were
the
most
prized
woman
was
worshipped
because
she
was
a
woman
not
because
she
resembled
a
man
benevolence
and
compassion
and
simplicity
were
her
cardinal
virtues
though
her
sports
were
masculine
her
character
was
feminine
she
yielded
to
man
in
matters
of
reason
and
intellect
but
he
yielded
to
her
in
the
virtues
of
the
heart
and
the
radiance
of
the
soul
she
associated
with
man
without
seductive
spectacles
or
demoralizing
excitements
and
retained
her
influence
by
securing
his
respect
in
antiquity
there
was
no
respect
for
the
sex
even
when
aspasia
enthralled
pericles
by
the
fascinations
of
blended
intellect
and
beauty
but
there
was
respect
in
the
feudal
ages
when
women
were
unlettered
and
unpolished
and
this
respect
was
alike
the
basis
of
friendship
and
the
key
to
power
it
was
not
elegance
of
manners
nor
intellectual
culture
nor
physical
beauty
which
elevated
the
women
of
chivalry
but
their
courage
their
fidelity
their
sympathy
their
devotion
to
duty
qualities
which
no
civilization
ought
to
obscure
and
for
the
loss
of
which
no
refinements
of
life
can
make
up
thus
chivalry
the
most
interesting
institution
of
the
middle
ages
rejoicing
in
deeds
of
daring
guided
by
honor
and
renown
executing
enterprises
almost
extravagant
battling
injustice
and
wrong
binding
together
the
souls
of
a
great
fraternity
scorning
lies
revering
truth
devoted
to
the
church
could
not
help
elevating
the
sex
to
which
its
proudest
efforts
were
pledged
by
cherishing
elevated
conceptions
of
love
by
offering
all
the
courtesies
of
friendship
by
coming
to
the
rescue
of
innocence
by
stimulating
admiration
of
all
that
is
heroic
and
by
asserting
the
honor
of
the
loved
ones
even
at
the
risk
of
life
and
limb
in
the
dark
ages
of
european
society
woman
takes
her
place
for
the
first
time
in
the
world
as
the
equal
and
friend
of
man
not
by
physical
beauty
not
by
graces
of
manner
not
even
by
intellectual
culture
but
by
the
solid
virtues
of
the
heart
brought
to
light
by
danger
isolation
and
practical
duties
and
by
that
influence
which
radiated
from
the
cross
divest
chivalry
of
the
religious
element
and
you
take
away
its
glory
and
its
fascination
the
knight
would
be
only
a
hardhearted
warrior
oppressing
the
poor
and
miserable
and
only
interesting
from
his
deeds
of
valor
but
christianity
softened
him
and
made
him
human
while
it
dignified
the
partner
of
his
toils
and
gave
birth
to
virtues
which
commanded
reverence
the
soul
of
chivalry
closely
examined
in
its
influence
over
men
or
over
women
after
all
was
that
power
which
is
and
will
be
through
all
the
ages
the
hope
and
glory
of
our
world
thus
with
all
the
miseries
cruelties
injustices
and
hardships
of
feudal
life
there
were
some
bright
spots
showing
that
providence
never
deserts
the
world
and
that
though
progress
may
be
slow
in
the
infancy
of
races
yet
with
the
light
of
christianity
even
if
it
be
darkened
this
progress
is
certain
and
will
be
more
and
more
rapid
as
christianity
achieves
its
victories

in

has
incorporated
the
spirit
of
ancient
chivalry
the
crusades
the
great
external
event
of
the
middle
ages
was
the
crusades
indeed
they
were
the
only
common
enterprise
in
which
europe
ever
engaged
such
an
event
ought
to
be
very
interesting
since
it
has
reference
to
conflicting
passions
and
interests
unfortunately
in
a
literary
point
of
view
there
is
no
central
figure
in
the
great
drama
which
the
princes
of
europe
played
for
two
hundred
years
and
hence
the
crusades
have
but
little
dramatic
interest
no
one
man
represents
that
mighty
movement
it
was
a
great
wave
of
inundation
flooding
asia
with
the
unemployed
forces
of
europe
animated
by
passions
which
excite
our
admiration
our
pity
and
our
reprobation
they
are
chiefly
interesting
for
their
results
and
results
which
were
unforeseen
a
philosopher
sees
in
them
the
hand
of
providence
the
overruling
of
mortal
wrath
to
the
praise
of
him
who
governs
the
universe
i
know
of
no
great
movement
of
blind
forces
so
pregnant
with
mighty
consequences
the
crusades
were
a
and
a
movement
they
represent
the
passions
and
ideas
of
europe
in
the
twelfth
and
thirteenth
centuries
its
chivalry
its
hatred
of
mohammedanism
and
its
desire
to
possess
the
spots
consecrated
by
the
sufferings
of
our
lord
their
long
continuance
shows
the
intensity
of
the
sentiments
which
animated
them
they
were
aggressive
wars
alike
fierce
and
unfortunate
absorbing
to
the
nations
that
embarked
in
them
but
of
no
interest
to
us
apart
from
the
moral
lessons
to
be
drawn
from
them
perhaps
one
reason
why
history
is
so
dull
to
most
people
is
that
the
greater
part
of
it
is
a
record
of
battles
and
sieges
of
military
heroes
and
conquerors
this
is
true
of
greece
of
rome
of
the
middle
ages
and
of
our
modern
times
down
to
the
nineteenth
century
but
such
chronicles
of
everlasting
battles
and
sieges
do
not
satisfy
this
generation
hence
our
more
recent
historians
wishing
to
avoid
the
monotony
of
ordinary
history
have
attempted
to
explore
the
common
life
of
the
people
and
to
bring
out
their
manners
and
habits
they
would
succeed
in
making
history
more
interesting
if
the
materials
at
present
were
not
so
scanty
and
unsatisfactory
the
only
way
to
make
the
history
of
wars
interesting
is
to
go
back
to
the
ideas
passions
and
interests
which
they
represent
then
we
penetrate
to
the
heart
of
history
and
feel
its
life
for
all
the
great
wars
of
the
world
we
shall
see
are
exponents
of
its
great
moving
spiritual
forces
the
wars
of
cyrus
and
alexander
represent
the
passion
of
military
glory
those
of
marius
sylla
pompey
and
caesar
the
desire
of
political
aggrandizement
those
of
constantine
and
theodosius
the
desire
for
political
unity
and
the
necessity
of
the
sweeping
and
desolating
inundations
of
the
barbarians
from
the
third
to
the
sixth
century
represent
the
poverty
of
those
rude
nations
and
their
desire
to
obtain
settlements
more
favorable
to
getting
a
living
the
conquests
of
mohammed
and
his
successors
were
made
to
swell
the
number
of
converts
of
a
new
religion
the
perpetual
strife
of
the
baronial
lords
was
to
increase
their
domains
the
wars
of
charlemagne
and
charles
were
to
revive
the
imperialism
of
the
caesars
to
create
new
universal
monarchies
the
wars
which
grew
out
of
the
reformation
were
to
preserve
or
secure
religious
liberty
those
which
followed
were
to
maintain
the
balance
of
power
those
of
napoleon
were
at
first
at
least
nominally
to
spread
or
defend
the
ideas
of
the
french
revolution
until
he
became
infatuated
with
the
love
of
military
glory
our
first
great
war
was
to
secure
national
independence
and
our
second
to
preserve
national
unity
the
contest
between
prussia
and
france
was
to
prevent
the
ascendency
of
either
of
those
great
states
the
wars
of
the
english
in
india
were
to
find
markets
for
english
goods
employment
for
the
sons
of
the
higher
classes
and
a
new
field
for
colonization
and
political
power
so
all
the
great
passions
and
interests
which
have
moved
mankind
have
found
their
vent
in
war
rough
barbaric
spoliations
love
of
glory
and
political
aggrandizement
desire
to
spread
religious
ideas
love
of
liberty
greediness
for
wealth
unity
of
nations
jealousy
of
other
powers
even
the
desire
to
secure
general
peace
and
tranquillity
most
wars
have
had
in
view
the
attainment
of
great
ends
and
it
is
in
the
ultimate
results
of
them
that
we
see
the
progress
of
nations
thus
wars
contemplated
in
a
philosophical
aspect
in
spite
of
their
repulsiveness
are
invested
with
dignity
and
really
indicate
great
moral
and
intellectual
movements
as
well
as
the
personal
ambition
or
vanity
of
conquerors
they
are
the
ultimate
solutions
of
great
questions
not
to
be
solved
in
any
other
way
unfortunately
i
grant
on
account
of
human
wickedness
and
i
know
of
no
great
wars
much
as
i
loathe
and
detest
them
and
severely
and
justly
as
they
may
be
reprobated
which
have
not
been
overruled
for
the
ultimate
welfare
of
society
the
wars
of
alexander
led
to
the
introduction
of
grecian
civilization
into
asia
and
egypt
those
of
the
romans
to
the
pacification
of
the
world
and
the
reign
of
law
and
order
those
of
barbarians
to
the
colonization
of
the
provinces
of
the
roman
empire
by
hardier
and
more
energetic
nations
those
of
charlemagne
to
the
ultimate
suppression
of
barbaric
invasions
those
of
the
saracens
to
the
acknowledgment
of
one
god
those
of
charles
to
the
recognized
necessity
of
a
balance
of
power
those
which
grew
out
of
the
reformation
to
religious
liberty
the
huguenots
contest
undermined
the
ascendency
of
roman
priests
in
france
the
seven
years
war
developed
the
naval
power
of
england
and
gave
to
her
a
prominent
place
among
the
nations
and
exposed
the
weakness
of
austria
so
long
the
terror
of
europe
the
wars
of
louis
xiv
sowed
the
seeds
of
the
french
revolution
those
of
napoleon
vindicated
its
great
ideas
those
of
england
in
india
introduced
the
civilization
of
a
christian
nation
those
of
the
americans
secured
liberty
and
the
unity
of
their
vast
nation
the
majesty
of
the
governor
of
the
universe
is
seen
in
nothing
more
impressively
than
in
the
direction
which
the
wrath
of
man
is
made
to
take
now
these
remarks
apply
to
the
crusades
they
represent
prevailing
ideas
their
origin
was
a
universal
hatred
of
mohammedans
like
all
the
institutions
of
the
middle
ages
they
were
a
great
contradiction
debasement
in
glory
and
glory
in
debasement
with
all
the
fierceness
and
superstition
and
intolerance
of
feudal
barons
we
see
in
the
crusades
the
exercise
of
gallantry
personal
heroism
tenderness
christian
courtesy
the
virtues
of
chivalry
unselfishness
and
magnanimity
but
they
ended
in
giving
a
new
impulse
to
civilization
which
will
be
more
minutely
pointed
out
before
i
close
my
lecture
thus
the
crusades
are
really
worthy
to
be
chronicled
by
historians
above
anything
else
which
took
place
in
the
middle
ages
since
they
gave
birth
to
mighty
agencies
which
still
are
vital
forces
in
society
even
as
everything
in
american
history
pales
before
that
awful
war
which
arrayed
in
our
times
the
north
against
the
south
in
desperate
and
deadly
contest
the
history
of
which
remains
to
be
written
but
can
not
be
written
till
the
animosities
which
provoked
it
have
passed
away
what
a
small
matter
to
future
historians
is
rapid
colonization
and
development
of
material
resources
in
comparison
with
the
sentiments
which
provoked
that
war
what
will
future
philosophers
care
how
many
bushels
of
wheat
are
raised
in
minnesota
or
of
corn
brought
from
illinois
or
hogs
slaughtered
in
chicago
or
yards
of
cloth
woven
in
lowell
or
cases
of
goods
packed
in
new
york
or
bales
of
carpets
manufactured
in
philadelphia
or
pounds
of
cotton
exported
from
new
orleans
or
meetings
of
railway
presidents
at
cincinnati
to
pool
the
profits
of
their
monopolies
or
conventions
held
in
boston
or
schemes
of
speculators
ventilated
in
the
lobbies
of
washington
or
and
gambling
operations
take
place
in
every
large
city
of
the
country
compared
with
the
mighty
marshalling
of
forces
on
the
banks
of
the
potomac
at
the
call
of
patriotism
to
preserve
the
life
of
the
republic
you
can
not
divest
war
of
dignity
and
interest
when
the
grandest
results
which
affect
the
permanent
welfare
of
nations
are
made
to
appear
the
crusades
as
they
were
historically
developed
are
mixed
up
with
the
religious
ideas
of
the
middle
ages
with
the
domination
of
popes
with
the
feudal
system
with
chivalry
with
monastic
life
with
the
central
power
of
kings
with
the
birth
of
mercantile
states
with
the
fears
and
interests
of
england
france
germany
and
italy
for
two
hundred
years
yea
with
the
architecture
commerce
geographical
science
and
all
the
arts
then
known
all
these
principalities
and
powers
and
institutions
and
enterprises
were
affected
by
them
so
that
at
their
termination
a
new
era
in
civilization
began
grasp
the
crusades
and
you
comprehend
one
of
the
forces
which
undermined
the
institutions
of
the
middle
ages
it
is
not
a
little
remarkable
that
the
earliest
cause
of
the
crusades
so
far
as
i
am
able
to
trace
was
the
adoption
by
the
european
nations
of
some
of
the
principles
of
eastern
theogonies
which
pertained
to
an
asiatic
theological
idea
prepared
the
way
for
the
war
between
europe
and
asia
the
european
pietist
embraced
the
religious
tenets
of
the
asiatic
monk
which
centred
in
the
propitiation
of
the
deity
by
works
of
penance
one
of
the
approved
and
popular
forms
of
penance
was
a
pilgrimage
to
sacred
places
seen
equally
among
degenerate
christian
sects
in
asia
minor
and
among
the
mohammedans
of
arabia
what
place
so
sacred
as
jerusalem
the
scene
of
the
passion
and
resurrection
of
our
lord
ever
since
the
empress
helena
had
built
a
church
at
jerusalem
it
had
been
thronged
with
pious
pilgrims
a
pilgrimage
to
old
jerusalem
would
open
the
doors
of
the
new
jerusalem
whose
streets
were
of
gold
and
whose
palaces
were
of
pearls
at
the
close
of
the
tenth
century
there
was
great
suffering
in
europe
bordering
on
despair
the
calamities
of
ordinary
life
were
so
great
that
the
end
of
the
world
seemed
to
be
at
hand
universal
fear
of
impending
divine
wrath
seized
the
minds
of
men
a
great
religious
awakening
took
place
especially
in
england
france
and
germany
in
accordance
with
the
sentiments
of
the
age
there
was
every
form
of
penance
to
avert
the
anger
of
god
and
escape
the
flames
of
hell
the
most
popular
form
of
penance
was
the
pilgrimage
to
jerusalem
long
and
painful
as
it
was
could
the
pilgrim
but
reach
that
consecrated
spot
he
was
willing
to
die
the
village
pastor
delivered
the
staff
into
his
hands
girded
him
with
a
scarf
and
attached
to
it
a
leathern
scrip
friends
and
neighbors
accompanied
him
a
little
way
on
his
toilsome
journey
which
lay
across
the
alps
through
the
plains
of
lombardy
over
illyria
and
pannonia
along
the
banks
of
the
danube
by
moesia
and
dacia
to
belgrade
and
constantinople
and
then
across
the
bosphorus
through
bithynia
cilicia
and
syria
until
the
towers
and
walls
of
tyre
ptolemais
and
caesarea
proclaimed
that
he
was
at
length
in
the
holy
land
barons
and
common
people
swell
the
number
of
these
pilgrims
the
haughty
knight
who
has
committed
unpunished
murders
and
the
pensive
saint
wrapt
in
religious
ecstasies
rival
each
other
in
humility
and
zeal
those
who
have
no
money
sell
their
lands
those
who
have
no
lands
to
sell
throw
themselves
on
providence
and
beg
their
way
for
fifteen
hundred
miles
among
strangers
the
roads
are
filled
with
these
travellers
on
foot
in
rags
fainting
from
hunger
and
fatigue
what
sufferings
to
purchase
the
favor
of
god
or
to
realize
the
attainment
of
pious
curiosity
the
heart
almost
bleeds
to
think
that
our
ancestors
could
ever
have
been
so
visionary
and
misguided
that
such
a
gloomy
view
of
divine
forgiveness
should
have
permeated
the
middle
ages
but
the
sorrows
of
the
pious
pilgrims
did
not
end
when
they
reached
the
holy
land
jerusalem
was
then
in
the
hands
of
the
turks
and
saracens
or
orientals
a
general
name
given
to
the
arabian
mohammedans
who
exacted
two
pieces
of
gold
from
every
pilgrim
as
the
price
of
entering
jerusalem
and
moreover
reviled
and
maltreated
him
the
holy
sepulchre
could
be
approached
only
on
the
condition
of
defiling
it
the
reports
of
these
atrocities
and
cruelties
at
last
reached
the
europeans
filling
them
with
sympathy
for
the
sufferers
and
indignation
for
the
persecutors
an
intense
hatred
of
mohammedans
was
generated
and
became
universal
a
desire
for
vengeance
unparalleled
in
history
popes
and
bishops
weep
barons
and
princes
swear
every
convent
and
every
castle
in
europe
is
animated
with
deadly
resentment
rage
indignation
and
vengeance
are
the
passions
of
the
hour
all
concentrated
on
the
infidels
which
term
was
the
bitterest
reproach
that
each
party
could
inflict
on
the
other
an
infidel
was
accursed
of
god
and
was
consigned
to
human
wrath
and
the
mohammedans
had
the
same
hatred
of
christians
that
christians
had
of
mohammedans
in
the
eyes
of
each
their
enemies
were
infidels
and
they
were
enemies
because
they
were
regarded
as
infidels
such
a
state
of
feeling
in
both
europe
and
asia
could
not
but
produce
an
outbreak
a
spark
only
was
needed
to
kindle
a
conflagration
that
spark
was
kindled
when
peter
of
amiens
a
returned
hermit
aroused
the
martial
nations
to
a
bloody
war
on
these
enemies
of
god
and
man
he
was
a
man
with
neglected
beard
and
disordered
dress
he
had
no
genius
nor
learning
nor
political
position
he
was
a
mere
fanatic
fierce
furious
with
ungovernable
rage
but
he
impersonated
the
leading
idea
of
the
age
hatred
of
the
infidels
as
the
mohammedans
were
called
and
therefore
his
voice
was
heard
the
pope
used
him
as
a
tool
two
centuries
later
he
could
not
have
made
himself
a
passing
wonder
but
he
is
the
means
of
stirring
up
the
indignation
of
europe
into
a
blazing
flame
he
itinerates
france
and
italy
exposing
the
wrongs
of
the
christians
and
the
cruelties
of
the
saracens
the
obstruction
placed
in
the
way
of
salvation
at
length
a
council
is
assembled
at
clermont
and
the
pope
urban
presides
and
urges
on
the
sacred
war
in
the
year
the
pope
in
his
sacred
robes
and
in
the
presence
of
four
hundred
bishops
and
abbots
ascends
the
pulpit
erected
in
the
and
tells
the
immense
multitude
how
their
faith
is
trodden
in
the
dust
how
the
sacred
relics
are
desecrated
and
appeals
alike
to
chivalry
and
religion
more
than
this
he
does
just
what
mohammed
did
when
he
urged
his
followers
to
take
the
sword
he
announces
in
fiery
language
the
fullest
indulgence
to
all
who
take
part
in
the
expedition
that
all
their
sins
shall
be
forgiven
and
that
heaven
shall
be
opened
to
them
it
is
the
voice
of
god
they
cry
we
will
hasten
to
the
deliverance
of
the
sacred
city
every
man
stimulates
the
passions
of
his
neighbor
all
vie
in
their
contributions
the
knights
especially
are
enthusiastic
for
they
can
continue
their
accustomed
life
without
penance
and
yet
obtain
the
forgiveness
of
their
sins
religious
fears
are
turned
at
first
into
the
channel
of
penance
and
penance
is
made
easy
by
the
indulgence
of
the
martial
passions
every
recruit
wore
a
red
cross
and
was
called
whence
the
name
of
the
holy
war
thus
the
crusades
began
at
the
close
of
the
eleventh
century
when
william
rufus
was
king
of
england
when
henry
iv
was
still
emperor
of
germany
when
anselm
was
reigning
at
canterbury
as
spiritual
head
of
the
english
church
ten
years
after
the
great
hildebrand
had
closed
his
turbulent
pontificate
i
need
not
detail
the
history
of
this
first
crusade
of
the
two
hundred
thousand
who
set
out
with
peter
the
hermit
this
fiery
fanatic
with
no
practical
abilities
only
twenty
thousand
succeeded
in
reaching
even
constantinople
the
rest
miserably
perished
by
the
way
a
most
disorderly
rabble
and
nothing
illustrates
the
darkness
of
the
age
more
impressively
than
that
a
mere
monk
should
have
been
allowed
to
lead
two
hundred
thousand
armed
men
on
an
enterprise
of
such
difficulty
how
little
the
science
of
war
was
comprehended
and
even
of
the
five
hundred
thousand
men
under
godfrey
tancred
bohemond
and
other
great
feudal
princes
men
of
rare
personal
valor
and
courage
men
who
led
the
flower
of
the
european
chivalry
thousand
remained
after
the
conquest
of
jerusalem
the
glorious
array
of
a
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
horsemen
in
full
armor
was
a
miserable
failure
the
lauded
warriors
of
feudal
europe
effected
almost
nothing
tasso
attempted
to
immortalize
their
deeds
but
how
insignificant
they
were
compared
with
even
homer
heroes
a
modern
army
of
thousand
men
could
not
only
have
put
the
whole
five
hundred
thousand
to
rout
in
an
hour
but
could
have
delivered
palestine
in
a
few
months
even
one
of
the
standing
armies
of
the
sixteenth
century
under
such
a
general
as
henry
iv
or
the
duke
of
guise
could
have
effected
more
than
all
the
crusaders
of
two
hundred
years
the
crusaders
numbered
many
heroes
but
scarcely
a
single
general
there
was
no
military
discipline
among
them
they
knew
nothing
of
tactics
or
strategy
they
fought
in
groups
as
in
the
contests
of
barons
among
themselves
individually
they
were
gallant
and
brave
and
performed
prodigies
of
valor
with
their
swords
and
but
there
was
no
direction
given
to
their
strength
by
leaders
the
second
crusade
preached
half
a
century
afterwards
by
saint
bernard
and
commanded
by
an
emperor
of
germany
and
a
king
of
france
proved
equally
unfortunate
not
a
single
trophy
consoled
europe
for
the
additional
loss
of
two
hundred
thousand
men
the
army
melted
away
in
foolish
sieges
for
which
the
crusaders
had
no
genius
or
proper
means
the
third
crusade
and
the
most
famous
which
began
in
the
year
of
which
philip
augustus
of
france
richard
coeur
de
lion
of
england
and
frederic
barbarossa
of
germany
were
the
leaders
the
three
greatest
monarchs
of
their
age
was
also
signally
unsuccessful
feudal
armies
seem
to
have
learned
nothing
in
one
hundred
years
of
foreign
warfare
or
else
they
had
greater
difficulties
to
contend
with
abler
generals
to
meet
than
they
dreamed
of
who
reaped
the
real
advantages
like
saladin
sir
walter
scott
in
his
ivanhoe
has
not
probably
exaggerated
the
military
prowess
of
the
heroes
of
this
war
or
the
valor
of
templars
and
hospitallers
yet
the
finest
array
of
feudal
forces
in
the
middle
ages
from
which
so
much
was
expected
wasted
its
strength
and
committed
innumerable
mistakes
it
proved
how
useless
was
a
feudal
army
for
a
distant
and
foreign
war
philip
may
have
been
wily
and
richard
but
neither
had
the
generalship
of
saladin
though
they
triumphed
at
tiberias
at
jaffa
at
caesarea
though
prodigies
of
valor
were
performed
though
ptolemais
or
acre
the
strongest
city
of
the
east
was
taken
yet
no
great
military
results
followed
more
blood
was
shed
at
this
famous
siege
which
lasted
three
years
than
ought
to
have
sufficed
for
the
subjugation
of
asia
there
were
no
decisive
battles
and
yet
one
hundred
battles
took
place
under
its
walls
slaughter
effected
nothing
jerusalem
which
had
been
retaken
by
the
saracens
still
remained
in
their
hands
and
never
afterwards
was
conquered
by
the
europeans
the
leaders
returned
dejected
to
their
kingdoms
and
the
bones
of
their
followers
whitened
the
soil
of
palestine
the
fourth
crusade
incited
by
pope
innocent
three
years
after
terminated
with
divisions
among
the
states
of
christendom
without
weakening
the
power
of
the
saracens
among
other
expeditions
was
one
called
the
children
crusade
a
wretched
fanatical
misery
resulting
in
the
enslavement
of
many
and
the
death
of
thousands
by
shipwreck
and
exposure
the
fifth
crusade
commanded
by
the
emperor
frederic
ii
of
germany
was
diverted
altogether
from
the
main
object
and
spent
its
force
on
constantinople
that
city
was
taken
but
the
holy
land
was
not
delivered
the
byzantine
empire
was
then
in
the
last
stages
of
decrepitude
or
its
capital
would
not
have
fallen
as
it
did
from
a
naval
attack
made
by
the
venetians
and
in
revenge
for
the
treacheries
and
injuries
of
the
greek
emperors
to
former
crusaders
this
instead
of
weakening
the
mussulmans
broke
down
the
chief
obstacle
to
their
entrance
into
europe
shortly
afterward
the
sixth
crusade
only
secured
the
capture
of
damietta
on
the
banks
of
the
nile
the
seventh
and
last
of
these
miserable
wars
was
the
most
unfortunate
of
all
the
saintly
monarch
of
france
perished
with
most
of
his
forces
on
the
coast
of
africa
and
the
ruins
of
carthage
were
the
only
conquest
which
was
made
europe
now
fairly
sickened
over
the
losses
and
misfortunes
and
defeats
of
nearly
two
centuries
during
which
five
millions
are
supposed
to
have
lost
their
lives
famine
and
pestilence
destroyed
more
than
the
sword
before
disheartened
europe
could
again
rally
the
last
strongholds
of
the
christians
were
wrested
away
by
the
mohammedans
and
their
gallant
but
unsuccessful
defenders
were
treated
with
every
inhumanity
and
barbarously
murdered
in
spite
of
truces
and
treaties
such
were
the
famous
crusades
only
the
main
facts
of
which
i
allude
to
for
to
describe
them
all
or
even
the
more
notable
incidents
would
fill
volumes
all
interesting
to
be
read
in
detail
by
those
who
have
leisure
all
marked
by
prodigious
personal
valor
all
disgraceful
for
the
want
of
unity
of
action
and
the
absence
of
real
generalship
they
indicate
the
enormous
waste
of
forces
which
characterizes
nations
in
their
progress
this
waste
of
energies
is
one
of
the
great
facts
of
all
history
surpassed
only
by
the
apparent
waste
of
the
forces
of
nature
or
the
fruits
of
the
earth
in
the
transition
period
between
the
time
when
men
roamed
in
forests
and
the
time
when
they
cultivated
the
land
see
what
a
vast
destruction
there
has
been
of
animals
by
each
other
what
a
waste
of
plants
and
vegetables
when
they
could
not
be
utilized
why
should
man
escape
the
universal
waste
when
reason
is
ignored
or
misdirected
of
what
use
or
value
could
palestine
have
been
to
europeans
in
the
middle
ages
of
what
use
can
any
country
be
to
conquerors
when
it
can
not
be
civilized
or
made
to
contribute
to
their
wants
europe
then
had
no
need
of
asia
and
that
perhaps
is
the
reason
why
europe
then
could
not
conquer
asia
providence
interfered
and
rebuked
the
mad
passions
which
animated
the
invaders
and
swept
them
all
away
were
palestine
really
needed
by
europe
it
could
be
wrested
from
the
turks
with
less
effort
than
was
made
by
the
feeblest
of
the
crusaders
constantinople
the
most
magnificent
site
for
a
central
power
was
indeed
wrested
from
the
greek
emperors
and
kept
one
hundred
years
but
the
europeans
did
not
know
what
to
do
with
the
splendid
prize
and
it
was
given
to
the
turks
who
made
it
the
capital
of
a
vital
empire
all
the
good
which
resulted
to
europe
from
the
temporary
possession
of
constantinople
was
the
introduction
into
europe
of
grecian
literature
and
art
its
political
and
mercantile
importance
was
not
appreciated
nor
then
even
scarcely
needed
it
will
one
day
become
again
the
spoil
of
that
nation
which
can
most
be
benefited
by
it
such
is
the
course
events
are
made
to
take
in
this
brief
notice
of
the
most
unsuccessful
wars
in
which
europe
ever
engaged
we
can
not
help
noticing
their
great
mistakes
we
see
rashness
depreciation
of
enemies
want
of
foresight
ignorance
of
the
difficulties
to
be
surmounted
the
crusaders
were
diverted
from
their
main
object
and
wasted
their
forces
in
attacking
unimportant
cities
or
fortresses
out
of
their
way
they
invaded
the
islands
of
the
mediterranean
egypt
africa
and
greek
possessions
they
quarrelled
with
their
friends
and
they
quarrelled
with
each
other
the
chieftains
sought
their
individual
advantage
rather
than
the
general
good
nor
did
they
provide
themselves
with
the
necessities
for
such
distant
operations
they
had
no
commissariat
without
which
even
a
modern
army
fails
they
were
captivated
by
trifles
and
frivolities
rather
than
directing
their
strength
to
the
end
in
view
they
allowed
themselves
to
be
seduced
by
both
greek
and
infidel
arts
and
vices
they
were
betrayed
into
the
most
foolish
courses
they
had
no
proper
knowledge
of
the
forces
with
which
they
were
to
contend
they
wantonly
massacred
their
foes
when
they
fell
into
their
hands
increased
the
animosity
of
the
mohammedans
and
united
them
in
a
concert
which
they
should
themselves
have
sought
they
marched
by
land
when
they
should
have
sailed
by
sea
and
they
sailed
by
sea
when
they
should
have
marched
by
land
they
intrusted
the
command
to
monks
and
inexperienced
leaders
they
obeyed
the
mandates
of
apostolic
vicars
when
they
should
have
considered
military
necessities
in
fact
there
was
no
unity
of
action
and
scarcely
unity
of
end
what
would
the
great
masters
of
grecian
and
roman
warfare
have
thought
of
these
blunders
and
stupidities
to
say
nothing
of
modern
generals
the
conduct
of
those
wars
excites
our
contempt
in
spite
of
the
heroism
of
individual
knights
we
despise
the
incapacity
of
leaders
as
much
as
we
abhor
the
fanaticism
which
animated
their
labors
the
crusades
have
no
bright
side
apart
from
the
piety
and
valor
of
some
who
embarked
in
them
hence
they
are
less
and
less
interesting
to
modern
readers
the
romance
about
them
has
ceased
to
affect
us
we
only
see
mistakes
and
follies
and
who
cares
to
dwell
on
the
infirmities
of
human
nature
it
is
only
what
is
great
in
man
that
moves
and
exalts
us
there
is
nothing
we
dwell
upon
with
pleasure
in
these
aggressive
useless
unjustifiable
wars
except
the
chivalry
associated
with
them
the
reason
of
modern
times
as
sternly
rebukes
them
as
the
heart
of
the
middle
ages
sickened
at
them
in
one
aspect
they
are
absolutely
repulsive
and
this
in
view
of
their
vices
the
crusaders
were
cruel
they
wantonly
massacred
their
enemies
even
when
defenceless
sixty
thousand
people
were
butchered
on
the
fall
of
jerusalem
ten
thousand
were
slaughtered
in
the
mosque
of
omar
the
christians
themselves
felt
safe
when
they
sought
the
retreat
of
churches
in
dire
calamities
at
home
but
they
had
no
respect
for
the
religious
retreats
of
infidels
when
any
city
fell
into
their
hands
there
was
wholesale
assassination
and
they
became
licentious
as
well
as
rapacious
and
cruel
they
learned
all
the
vices
of
the
east
even
under
the
walls
of
acre
they
sang
to
the
sounds
of
arabian
instruments
and
danced
amid
indecent
songs
when
they
took
constantinople
they
had
no
respect
for
either
churches
or
tombs
and
desecrated
even
the
pulpit
of
the
patriarch
their
original
religious
zeal
was
finally
lost
sight
of
entirely
in
their
military
license
they
became
more
hateful
to
the
orthodox
greeks
than
to
the
infidel
saracens
and
when
the
crusaders
returned
to
their
homes
what
few
of
them
lived
to
return
they
morally
poisoned
the
communities
and
villages
in
which
they
dwelt
they
became
vagabonds
and
vagrants
they
introduced
demoralizing
amusements
and
jugglers
and
strolling
players
appeared
for
the
first
time
in
europe
all
war
is
necessarily
demoralizing
even
war
in
defence
of
glorious
principles
and
especially
in
these
times
but
much
more
so
is
unjust
fanatical
and
unnecessary
war
but
i
turn
from
the
record
of
the
mistakes
follies
vices
miseries
and
crimes
which
marked
the
wickedest
and
most
wars
of
european
history
to
consider
their
ultimate
results
not
logical
results
for
these
were
melancholy
the
depopulation
of
europe
the
decimation
of
the
nobility
the
poverty
which
enormous
drains
of
money
from
their
natural
channels
produced
the
spread
of
vice
the
decline
of
even
feudal
virtues
these
evils
and
others
followed
naturally
and
inevitably
from
those
distant
wars
the
immediate
effects
of
all
war
are
evil
and
melancholy
murder
pillage
profanity
drunkenness
extravagance
public
distress
bitter
sorrows
wasted
energies
destruction
of
property
national
debts
exaltation
of
military
maxims
general
looseness
of
life
distaste
for
regular
pursuits
these
are
the
of
war
offensive
and
defensive
and
as
inevitable
and
uniform
as
the
laws
of
gravity
no
wars
were
ever
more
disastrous
than
the
crusades
in
their
immediate
effects
in
any
way
they
may
be
viewed
it
is
all
one
dark
view
of
disappointment
sorrow
wretchedness
and
sin
there
were
no
bright
spots
no
gains
only
calamities
nothing
consoled
europe
for
the
loss
of
five
millions
of
her
most
men
no
increase
of
territory
no
establishment
of
rights
no
glory
even
nothing
but
disgrace
and
ruin
as
in
that
maddest
of
all
modern
expeditions
the
invasion
of
russia
by
napoleon
but
after
the
lapse
of
nearly
seven
hundred
years
we
can
see
important
results
on
the
civilization
of
europe
indirectly
effected
not
intended
nor
designed
nor
dreamed
of
which
results
we
consider
beneficent
and
so
beneficent
that
the
world
is
probably
better
for
those
horrid
wars
it
was
fortunate
to
humanity
at
large
that
they
occurred
although
so
unfortunate
to
europe
at
the
time
in
the
end
europe
was
a
gainer
by
them
wickedness
was
not
the
seed
of
virtue
but
wickedness
was
overruled
woe
to
them
by
whom
offences
come
but
it
must
need
be
that
offences
come
men
in
their
depravity
will
commit
crimes
and
those
crimes
are
punished
but
even
these
are
made
to
praise
a
power
superior
to
that
of
devils
as
benevolent
as
it
is
omnipotent
in
which
fact
i
see
the
utter
hopelessness
of
earth
without
a
superintending
and
controlling
deity
one
important
result
of
the
crusades
was
the
barrier
they
erected
to
the
conquests
of
the
mohammedans
in
europe
it
is
true
that
the
wave
of
saracenic
invasion
had
been
arrested
by
charles
martel
four
or
five
hundred
years
before
but
in
the
mean
time
a
new
mohammedan
power
sprang
up
of
greater
vigor
of
equal
ferocity
and
of
a
more
stubborn
fanaticism
this
was
that
of
the
turks
who
had
their
eye
on
constantinople
and
all
eastern
europe
and
europe
might
have
submitted
to
their
domination
had
they
instead
of
the
latins
taken
constantinople
the
conquest
of
that
city
was
averted
several
hundred
years
and
when
at
last
it
fell
into
turkish
hands
christendom
was
strong
enough
to
resist
the
turkish
armies
we
must
remember
that
the
turks
were
a
great
power
even
in
the
times
of
peter
the
great
and
would
have
taken
vienna
but
for
john
sobieski
but
when
urban
at
the
council
of
clermont
urged
the
nations
of
europe
to
repel
the
infidels
on
the
confines
of
asia
rather
than
wait
for
them
in
the
heart
of
europe
the
asiatic
provinces
of
the
greek
empire
were
overrun
both
by
turks
and
saracens
they
held
syria
armenia
asia
minor
africa
spain
and
the
balearic
islands
had
not
godfrey
come
to
the
assistance
of
a
division
of
the
christian
army
when
it
was
surrounded
by
two
hundred
thousand
turks
at
the
battle
of
dorylaeum
the
christians
would
have
been
utterly
overwhelmed
and
the
turks
would
have
pressed
to
the
hellespont
but
they
were
beaten
back
into
syria
and
for
a
time
as
far
as
the
line
of
the
euphrates
but
for
that
timely
repulse
the
battles
of
belgrade
and
lepanto
might
not
have
been
fought
in
subsequent
ages
it
would
have
been
an
overwhelming
calamity
had
the
turks
invaded
europe
in
the
twelfth
century
the
loss
of
five
millions
on
the
plains
of
asia
would
have
been
nothing
in
comparison
to
an
invasion
of
europe
by
the
mohammedans
whether
saracens
or
turks
it
may
be
that
the
chivalry
of
europe
would
have
successfully
repelled
an
invasion
as
the
saracens
repelled
the
christians
on
their
soil
it
may
be
that
asia
could
not
have
conquered
europe
any
easier
than
europe
could
conquer
asia
i
do
not
know
how
far
statesmanlike
views
entered
into
the
minds
of
the
leaders
of
the
crusades
i
believe
the
sentiment
which
animated
peter
and
urban
and
bernard
was
pure
hatred
of
the
mohammedans
because
they
robbed
insulted
and
oppressed
the
pilgrims
and
not
any
controlling
fears
of
their
invasion
of
europe
if
such
a
fear
had
influenced
them
they
would
not
have
permitted
a
mere
rabble
to
invade
asia
there
would
have
been
a
sense
of
danger
stronger
than
that
of
hatred
which
does
not
seem
to
have
existed
in
the
of
the
crusaders
they
thought
it
an
easy
thing
to
capture
jerusalem
it
was
a
sort
of
holiday
march
of
the
chivalry
of
europe
under
richard
and
philip
augustus
perhaps
however
the
princes
of
europe
were
governed
by
political
rather
than
religious
reasons
some
few
statesmen
if
such
there
were
among
the
best
informed
of
bishops
and
abbots
may
have
felt
the
necessity
of
the
conflict
in
a
political
sense
but
i
do
not
believe
this
was
a
general
conviction
there
was
doubtless
a
political
necessity
although
men
were
too
fanatical
to
see
more
than
one
side
to
crush
the
saracens
because
they
were
infidels
and
not
because
they
were
warriors
but
whether
they
saw
it
or
not
or
armed
themselves
to
resist
a
danger
as
well
as
to
exterminate
heresy
the
ultimate
effects
were
all
the
same
the
crusaders
failed
in
their
direct
end
they
did
not
recover
palestine
but
they
so
weakened
or
diverted
the
mohammedan
armies
that
there
was
not
strength
enough
left
in
them
to
conquer
europe
or
even
to
invade
her
until
she
was
better
prepared
to
resist
it
as
she
did
at
the
battle
of
lepanto
one
of
the
decisive
battles
of
the
world
i
have
said
that
the
crusades
were
a
disastrous
failure
i
mean
in
their
immediate
ends
not
in
ultimate
results
if
it
is
probable
that
they
arrested
the
conquests
of
the
turks
in
europe
then
this
blind
and
fanatical
movement
effected
the
greatest
blessing
to
christendom
it
almost
seems
that
the
christians
were
hurled
into
the
crusades
by
an
irresistible
fate
to
secure
a
great
ultimate
good
or
to
use
christian
language
were
sent
as
blind
instruments
by
the
almighty
to
avert
a
danger
they
could
not
see
and
if
this
be
true
the
inference
is
logical
and
irresistible
that
god
uses
even
the
wicked
passions
of
men
to
effect
his
purposes
as
when
the
envy
of
haman
led
to
the
elevation
of
mordecai
and
to
the
deliverance
of
the
jews
from
one
of
their
greatest
dangers
another
and
still
more
noticeable
result
of
the
crusades
was
the
weakening
of
the
power
of
those
very
barons
who
embarked
in
the
wars
their
fanaticism
recoiled
upon
themselves
and
undermined
their
own
system
nothing
could
have
happened
more
effectually
to
loosen
the
rigors
of
the
feudal
system
it
was
the
baron
and
the
knight
that
marched
to
palestine
who
suffered
most
in
the
curtailment
of
the
privileges
which
they
had
abused
even
as
it
was
the
southern
planter
of
carolina
who
lost
the
most
heavily
in
the
war
which
he
provoked
to
defend
his
slave
property
in
both
cases
the
fetters
of
the
serfs
and
slaves
were
broken
by
their
own
masters
not
intentionally
of
course
but
really
and
effectually
how
blind
men
are
in
their
injustices
they
are
made
to
hang
on
the
gallows
which
they
have
erected
for
others
to
gratify
his
passion
of
punishing
the
infidels
whom
he
so
intensely
hated
the
baron
or
prince
was
obliged
to
grant
great
concessions
to
the
towns
and
villages
which
he
ruled
with
an
iron
hand
in
order
to
raise
money
for
his
equipment
and
his
journey
he
was
not
paid
by
government
as
are
modern
soldiers
and
officers
he
had
to
pay
his
own
expenses
and
they
were
heavier
than
he
had
expected
or
provided
for
sometimes
he
was
taken
captive
and
had
his
ransom
to
raise
to
pay
for
in
hard
cash
and
not
in
land
as
in
the
case
of
richard
of
england
when
on
his
return
from
palestine
he
was
imprisoned
in
austria
and
it
took
to
ransom
him
as
some
have
estimated
one
third
of
all
the
gold
and
silver
of
the
realm
chiefly
furnished
by
the
clergy
but
where
was
the
imprisoned
baron
to
get
the
money
for
his
ransom
not
from
the
jews
for
their
compound
interest
of
fifty
per
cent
every
six
months
would
have
ruined
him
in
less
than
two
years
but
the
village
guilds
had
money
laid
by
merchants
and
mechanics
in
the
towns
whom
he
despised
had
money
monasteries
had
money
he
therefore
gave
new
privileges
to
all
he
gave
charters
of
freedom
to
towns
he
made
concessions
to
the
peasantry
as
the
result
of
this
when
the
baron
came
back
from
the
wars
he
found
himself
much
poorer
than
when
he
went
away
he
found
his
lands
encumbered
his
castle
dilapidated
and
his
cattle
sold
in
short
he
was
as
we
say
of
a
proud
merchant
now
and
then
embarrassed
in
his
circumstances
he
was
obliged
to
economize
but
the
feudal
family
would
not
hear
of
retrenchment
and
the
baron
himself
had
become
more
extravagant
in
his
habits
as
travel
and
commerce
had
increased
he
had
new
wants
which
he
could
not
gratify
without
parting
with
either
lands
or
prerogatives
as
the
result
of
all
this
he
became
not
quite
so
overbearing
though
perhaps
more
sullen
for
he
saw
men
rising
about
him
who
were
as
rich
as
he
men
whom
his
ancestors
had
despised
the
artisans
who
belonged
to
the
leading
guilds
which
had
become
enriched
by
the
necessities
of
barons
or
by
that
strange
activity
of
trade
and
manufactures
which
war
seems
to
stimulate
as
well
as
to
destroy
these
rude
and
ignorant
people
were
not
so
servile
as
formerly
but
began
to
feel
a
sort
of
importance
especially
in
towns
and
cities
which
multiplied
wonderfully
during
the
crusades
in
other
words
they
were
no
longer
brutes
to
be
trodden
down
without
murmur
or
resistance
they
began
to
form
what
we
call
a
middle
class
feudalism
in
its
proud
ages
did
not
recognize
a
middle
class
the
impoverishment
of
nobles
by
the
crusades
laid
the
foundation
of
this
middle
class
at
least
in
large
towns
the
growth
of
cities
and
the
decay
of
feudalism
went
on
simultaneously
and
both
were
equally
the
result
of
the
crusades
if
the
noble
became
impoverished
the
merchant
became
enriched
and
the
merchant
lived
not
in
the
country
but
in
some
mercantile
mart
the
crusaders
had
need
of
ships
these
were
furnished
by
those
cities
which
had
obtained
from
feudal
sovereigns
charters
of
freedom
florence
pisa
venice
genoa
marseilles
became
centres
of
wealth
and
political
importance
the
growth
of
cities
and
the
extension
of
commerce
went
hand
in
hand
whatever
the
crusades
did
for
cities
they
did
equally
for
commerce
and
with
the
needs
of
commerce
came
improvement
in
naval
architecture
as
commerce
grew
the
ships
increased
in
size
and
convenience
and
the
products
which
the
ships
brought
from
asia
to
europe
were
not
only
introduced
but
they
were
cultivated
new
fruits
and
vegetables
were
raised
by
european
husbandmen
were
brought
from
damascus
and
from
tripoli
silk
fabrics
formerly
confined
to
constantinople
and
the
east
were
woven
in
italian
and
french
villages
the
venetians
obtained
from
tyrians
the
art
of
making
glass
the
greek
fire
suggested
gunpowder
architecture
received
an
immense
impulse
the
churches
became
less
sombre
and
heavy
and
more
graceful
and
beautiful
even
the
idea
of
the
arch
some
think
came
from
the
east
the
domes
and
minarets
of
venice
were
borrowed
from
constantinople
the
ornaments
of
byzantine
churches
and
palaces
were
brought
to
europe
the
horses
of
lysippus
carried
from
greece
to
rome
and
from
rome
to
constantinople
at
last
surmounted
the
palace
of
the
doges
houses
became
more
comfortable
churches
more
beautiful
and
palaces
more
splendid
even
manners
improved
and
intercourse
became
more
polished
chivalry
borrowed
many
of
its
courtesies
from
the
east
there
were
new
refinements
in
the
arts
of
cookery
as
well
as
of
society
literature
itself
received
a
new
impulse
as
well
as
science
it
was
from
constantinople
that
europe
received
the
philosophy
of
plato
and
aristotle
in
the
language
in
which
it
was
written
instead
of
translations
through
the
arabic
greek
scholars
came
to
italy
to
introduce
their
unrivalled
literature
and
after
grecian
literature
came
grecian
art
the
study
of
greek
philosophy
gave
a
new
stimulus
to
human
inquiry
and
students
flocked
to
the
universities
they
went
to
bologna
to
study
roman
law
as
well
as
to
paris
to
study
the
scholastic
philosophy
thus
the
germs
of
a
new
civilization
were
scattered
over
europe
it
so
happened
that
at
the
close
of
the
crusades
civilization
had
increased
in
every
country
of
europe
in
spite
of
the
losses
they
had
sustained
delusions
were
dispelled
and
greater
liberality
of
mind
was
manifest
the
world
opened
up
towards
the
east
and
was
larger
than
was
before
supposed
europe
and
asia
had
been
brought
together
and
recognized
each
other
inventions
and
discoveries
succeeded
the
new
scope
for
energies
which
the
crusades
opened
the
ships
which
had
carried
the
crusaders
to
asia
were
now
used
to
explore
new
coasts
and
harbors
navigators
learned
to
be
bolder
a
navigator
of
genoa
a
city
made
by
the
commerce
which
the
crusades
necessitated
crosses
the
atlantic
ocean
as
the
magnetic
needle
which
a
venetian
traveller
brought
from
asia
gave
a
new
direction
to
commerce
so
the
new
stimulus
to
learning
which
the
grecian
philosophy
effected
led
to
the
necessity
of
an
easier
form
of
writing
and
printing
appeared
with
the
shock
which
feudalism
received
from
the
crusades
central
power
was
once
more
wielded
by
kings
and
standing
armies
supplanted
the
feudal
the
crusaders
must
have
learned
something
from
their
mistakes
and
military
science
was
revived
there
is
scarcely
an
element
of
civilization
which
we
value
that
was
not
directly
or
indirectly
developed
by
the
crusades
yet
which
was
not
sought
for
or
anticipated
even
the
centralization
of
thrones
the
weakening
of
the
power
of
feudal
barons
the
rise
of
free
cities
the
growth
of
commerce
the
impulse
given
to
art
improvements
in
agriculture
the
rise
of
a
middle
class
the
wonderful
spread
of
literature
greater
refinements
in
manners
and
dress
increased
toleration
of
opinions
a
more
cheerful
view
of
life
the
simultaneous
development
of
energies
in
every
field
of
human
labor
new
hopes
and
aspirations
among
the
people
new
glories
around
courts
new
attractions
in
the
churches
new
comforts
in
the
villages
new
luxuries
in
the
cities
even
spiritual
power
became
less
grim
and
sepulchral
since
there
was
less
fear
to
work
upon
i
do
not
say
that
the
crusades
alone
produced
the
marvellous
change
in
the
condition
of
society
which
took
place
in
the
thirteenth
century
but
they
gave
an
impulse
to
this
change
the
strong
sapling
which
the
barbarians
brought
from
their
german
forests
and
planted
in
the
heart
of
europe
and
which
had
silently
grown
in
the
darkest
ages
of
barbarism
guarded
by
the
hand
of
providence
became
a
sturdy
tree
in
the
feudal
ages
and
bore
fruit
when
the
barons
had
wasted
their
strength
in
asia
the
crusades
improved
this
fruit
and
found
new
uses
for
it
and
scattered
it
far
and
wide
and
made
it
for
the
healing
of
the
nations
enterprise
of
all
sorts
succeeded
the
apathy
of
convents
and
castles
the
village
of
mud
huts
became
a
town
in
which
manufactures
began
as
new
wants
became
apparent
new
means
of
supplying
them
appeared
the
crusades
stimulated
these
wants
and
commerce
and
manufactures
supplied
them
the
modern
merchant
was
born
in
lombard
cities
which
supplied
the
necessities
of
the
crusaders
feudalism
ignored
trade
but
the
baron
found
his
rival
in
the
feudalism
disdained
art
but
increased
wealth
turned
peasants
into
carpenters
and
masons
carpenters
and
masons
combined
and
defied
their
old
masters
and
these
masters
left
their
estates
for
the
higher
civilization
of
cities
and
built
palaces
instead
of
castles
palaces
had
to
be
adorned
as
well
as
churches
and
the
painters
and
handicraftsmen
found
employment
so
one
force
stimulated
another
force
neither
of
which
would
have
appeared
if
feudal
life
had
remained
statu
the
only
question
to
settle
is
how
far
the
marked
progress
of
the
twelfth
and
thirteenth
centuries
may
be
traced
to
the
natural
development
of
the
germanic
races
under
the
influence
of
religion
or
how
far
this
development
was
hastened
by
those
vast
martial
expeditions
indirectly
indeed
but
really
historians
generally
give
most

to
the
latter
if
so

it
is
clear
that
the

disastrous

recorded
in

were
made

blindly

church
architecture
is
the
only
addition
which
the
middle
ages
made
to
art
but
even
this
fact
is
remarkable
when
we
consider
the
barbarism
and
ignorance
of
the
teutonic
nations
in
those
dark
and
gloomy
times
it
is
difficult
to
conceive
how
it
could
have
arisen
except
from
the
stimulus
of
religious
ideas
and
sentiments
like
the
vast
temples
of
the
egyptians
the
artists
who
built
the
hoary
and
attractive
cathedrals
and
abbey
churches
which
we
so
much
admire
are
unknown
men
to
us
and
yet
they
were
great
benefactors
it
is
probable
that
they
were
practical
and
working
architects
like
those
who
built
the
temples
of
greece
who
quietly
sought
to
accomplish
their
ends
not
to
make
pictures
but
to
make
buildings
as
economically
as
they
could
consistently
with
the
end
proposed
which
end
they
always
had
in
view
in
this
lecture
i
shall
not
go
back
to
classic
antiquity
nor
shall
i
undertake
to
enter
upon
any
disquisition
on
art
itself
but
simply
present
the
historical
developments
of
the
church
architecture
of
the
middle
ages
it
is
a
technical
and
complicated
subject
but
i
shall
try
to
make
myself
understood
it
suggests
however
great
ideas
and
national
developments
and
ought
to
be
interesting
the
romans
added
nothing
to
the
architecture
of
the
greeks
except
the
arch
and
the
use
of
brick
and
small
stones
for
the
materials
of
their
stupendous
structures
now
christianity
and
the
middle
ages
seized
the
arch
and
the
materials
of
the
roman
architects
and
gradually
formed
from
these
a
new
style
of
architecture
in
roman
architecture
there
was
no
symbolism
no
poetry
nothing
to
represent
consecrated
sentiments
it
was
mundane
in
its
ideas
and
ends
everything
was
for
utility
the
grandest
efforts
of
the
romans
were
feats
of
engineering
skill
rather
than
creations
inspired
by
the
love
of
the
beautiful
what
was
beautiful
in
their
edifices
was
borrowed
from
the
greeks
what
was
original
was
intended
to
accommodate
great
multitudes
whether
they
sought
the
sports
of
the
amphitheatre
or
the
luxury
of
the
bath
their
temples
were
small
comparatively
and
were
grecian
the
first
stage
in
the
development
of
church
architecture
was
reached
amid
the
declining
glories
of
roman
civilization
before
the
fall
of
the
empire
but
the
first
model
of
a
christian
church
was
not
built
until
after
the
imperial
persecutions
the
early
christians
worshipped
god
in
upper
chambers
in
catacombs
in
retired
places
where
they
would
not
be
molested
where
they
could
hide
in
safety
their
assemblies
were
small
and
their
meetings
unimportant
they
did
nothing
to
attract
attention
the
worshippers
were
mostly
unlettered
plebeian
people
with
now
and
then
a
converted
philosopher
or
centurion
or
lady
of
rank
they
met
for
prayer
exhortation
the
reading
of
the
scriptures
the
singing
of
sacred
melodies
and
mutual
support
in
trying
times
they
did
not
want
grand
edifices
the
plainer
the
place
in
which
they
assembled
the
better
suited
it
was
to
their
circumstances
and
necessities
they
scarcely
needed
a
rostrum
for
the
age
of
sermons
had
not
begun
still
less
the
age
of
litanies
and
music
and
pomps
for
such
people
in
that
palmy
age
of
faith
and
courage
when
the
seeds
of
a
new
religion
were
planted
in
danger
and
watered
with
tears
when
their
minds
were
directed
almost
entirely
to
the
soul
welfare
and
future
glory
when
they
loved
one
another
with
true
christian
disinterestedness
when
they
stimulated
each
other
enthusiasm
by
devotion
to
a
common
cause
one
lord
one
faith
one
baptism
when
they
were
too
insignificant
to
take
any
social
rank
too
poor
to
be
of
any
political
account
too
ignorant
to
attract
the
attention
of
philosophers
place
where
they
would
be
unmolested
and
retired
was
enough
in
process
of
time
when
their
numbers
had
increased
and
when
and
wherever
they
were
tolerated
when
money
began
to
flow
into
the
treasuries
and
especially
when
some
gifted
leader
educated
perhaps
in
famous
schools
yet
who
was
fervent
and
eloquent
desired
a
wider
field
for
usefulness
then
church
edifices
became
necessary
this
original
church
was
modelled
after
the
ancient
basilica
or
hall
of
justice
or
of
commerce
at
one
end
was
an
elevated
tribunal
and
back
of
this
what
was
called
the
apsis
a
rounded
space
with
arched
roof
the
whole
was
railed
off
or
separated
from
the
auditory
and
was
reserved
for
the
clergy
who
in
the
fourth
century
had
become
a
class
the
apsis
had
no
window
was
vaulted
and
its
walls
were
covered
with
figures
of
christ
and
of
the
saints
or
of
eminent
christians
who
in
later
times
were
canonized
by
the
popes
between
the
apsis
and
the
auditory
called
the
nave
was
the
altar
for
by
this
time
the
church
was
borrowing
names
and
emblems
from
the
jews
and
the
old
religions
from
the
apsis
to
the
extremity
of
the
other
end
of
the
building
were
two
rows
of
pillars
supporting
an
upper
wall
broken
by
circular
arches
and
windows
called
now
the
clear
story
in
the
low
walls
of
the
side
aisles
were
also
windows
both
the
nave
and
the
aisles
supported
a
framework
of
roof
lined
with
a
ceiling
adorned
with
painting
for
some
time
we
see
no
marked
departure
at
this
stage
from
the
ancient
basilica
the
church
is
simple
not
much
adorned
and
adapted
to
preaching
the
age
in
which
it
was
built
was
the
age
of
pulpit
orators
when
bishops
preached
like
basil
chrysostom
ambrose
augustine
and
leo
when
preaching
was
an
important
part
of
the
service
by
the
foolishness
of
which
the
world
was
to
be
converted
probably
there
were
but
few
what
we
should
call
fine
churches
but
there
was
one
at
rome
which
was
justly
celebrated
built
by
theodosius
and
called
paul
it
is
now
outside
the
walls
of
the
modern
city
the
nave
is
divided
into
five
aisles
and
the
main
one
opening
into
the
apsis
is
spanned
by
a
lofty
arch
supported
by
two
colossal
columns
the
apsis
is
eighty
feet
in
breadth
all
parts
of
the
church
one
of
the
largest
of
rome
are
decorated
with
mosaics
it
has
two
small
transepts
at
the
extremity
of
the
nave
on
each
side
of
the
apsis
the
four
rows
of
magnificent
columns
supporting
semicircular
arches
are
corinthian
in
this
church
the
greek
and
roman
architecture
predominates
the
essential
form
of
the
church
is
like
a
pagan
basilica
we
see
convenience
but
neither
splendor
nor
poetry
moreover
it
is
cheerful
it
has
an
altar
and
an
apsis
but
it
is
adapted
to
preaching
rather
than
to
singing
the
public
dangers
produce
oratory
not
chants
the
voice
of
the
preacher
penetrates
the
minds
of
the
people
as
did
that
of
savonarola
at
florence
announcing
the
invasion
of
italy
by
the
french
days
of
fear
and
anxiety
reminding
us
also
of
chrysostom
at
antioch
when
in
his
spacious
basilican
church
he
roused
the
people
to
penitence
to
avert
the
ire
of
theodosius
the
first
transition
from
the
basilica
to
the
gothic
church
is
called
the
and
was
made
after
the
fall
of
the
empire
when
the
barbarians
had
erected
new
kingdoms
on
its
ruins
when
literature
and
art
were
indeed
crushed
yet
when
universal
desolation
was
succeeded
by
new
forms
of
government
and
new
habits
of
life
when
the
clergy
had
become
an
enormous
power
greatly
enriched
by
the
contributions
of
christian
princes
this
transition
retained
the
traditions
of
the
fallen
empire
and
yet
was
adapted
to
a
people
nominally
converted
to
christianity
it
arose
after
the
fall
of
the
merovingians
when
charlemagne
was
seeking
to
restore
the
glory
of
the
western
empire
paganism
had
been
suppressed
by
law
even
heresies
were
extinguished
in
the
west
kings
and
people
were
alike
orthodox
and
bowed
to
the
domination
of
the
church
abbeys
and
convents
were
founded
everywhere
and
richly
endowed
the
different
states
and
kingdoms
were
poor
but
the
wealth
that
existed
was
deposited
in
sacred
retreats
the
powers
of
the
state
were
the
nobles
warlike
and
ignorant
rapidly
becoming
feudal
barons
acknowledging
only
a
nominal
fealty
to
the
crown
kings
had
no
glory
defied
by
their
own
subjects
and
unsupported
by
standing
armies
but
these
haughty
barons
were
met
face
to
face
by
equally
haughty
bishops
armed
with
spiritual
weapons
these
bishops
were
surrounded
and
supported
by
priests
secular
and
regular
by
those
who
ruled
the
people
in
small
parishes
and
those
who
ruled
the
upper
classes
in
their
monastic
cells
learning
had
fled
to
monasteries
what
little
there
was
and
the
church
became
a
new
attraction
the
architects
of
the
romanesque
who
were
probably
churchmen
retained
the
nave
of
the
basilica
but
made
it
narrower
and
used
but
two
rows
of
columns
they
introduced
the
transepts
or
making
them
to
project
north
and
south
of
the
nave
in
the
space
separated
from
the
apsis
and
the
apsis
was
expanded
into
the
choir
filled
with
priests
and
choristers
the
building
now
assumes
the
form
of
a
cross
the
choir
is
elevated
several
steps
above
the
nave
and
beneath
it
is
the
crypt
where
the
bishops
and
abbots
and
saints
are
buried
at
the
intersection
of
choir
nave
and
transept
an
open
square
place
rises
a
square
tower
at
each
corner
of
which
is
a
massive
pier
supporting
four
arches
the
windows
are
narrow
with
semicircular
arches
at
the
western
entrance
at
the
end
opposite
the
apse
is
a
small
porch
where
the
consecrated
water
is
placed
in
an
urn
or
basin
and
this
is
inclosed
between
two
towers
the
old
roman
atrium
or
entirely
disappears
in
its
place
is
a
grander
fa√ßade
and
the
pillars
which
are
all
internal
like
those
of
an
egyptian
temple
not
external
as
in
the
greek
temple
have
no
longer
grecian
capitals
but
new
combinations
of
every
variety
and
the
pillars
are
even
more
heavy
and
massive
than
the
doric
the
flat
wooden
ceiling
of
the
nave
disappears
on
account
of
frequent
fires
and
the
eye
rests
on
arches
supporting
a
stone
roof
all
the
arches
are
semicircular
like
those
of
the
coliseum
and
of
the
roman
aqueducts
and
baths
they
are
built
of
small
stones
united
by
cement
the
building
is
low
and
heavy
and
its
external
beauty
is
in
the
west
front
or
fa√ßade
with
its
square
towers
and
circular
window
and
ornamented
portal
the
internal
beauty
is
from
the
pillars
supporting
the
roof
and
the
tower
which
intersects
the
nave
choir
and
transepts
sometimes
instead
of
a
tower
there
is
a
dome
reminding
us
of
byzantine
workmanship
but
this
romanesque
church
is
also
connected
with
monastic
institutions
whose
extensive
buildings
join
the
church
at
the
north
or
south
the
church
is
wedded
to
monasticism
one
supports
the
other
and
both
make
a
unity
exceedingly
efficient
in
the
middle
ages
the
communication
between
the
church
and
the
convent
is
effected
by
a
cloister
a
vaulted
gallery
surrounding
a
square
open
space
where
the
brothers
walk
and
meditate
but
do
not
talk
except
in
undertone
or
whisper
for
all
the
precincts
are
sacred
made
for
contemplation
and
silence
a
retreat
from
the
noisy
barbaric
world
connected
with
the
cloisters
is
a
court
opening
into
the
refectory
where
the
brothers
dine
on
herbs
and
eggs
and
a
little
meat
also
in
silence
and
where
the
rule
is
strict
in
gloom
an
ascetic
dreary
discipline
the
whole
range
of
buildings
is
enclosed
with
walls
like
a
fortress
you
see
in
this
architecture
the
gloom
and
desolation
which
overspread
the
world
churches
are
heavy
and
sombre
they
are
places
for
dreary
meditation
on
the
end
of
the
world
on
the
failure
of
civilization
on
the
degradation
of
humanity
and
yet
the
only
places
where
man
may
be
brought
in
contact
with
the
deity
who
presides
over
a
fallen
world
exalting
human
hopes
to
heaven
where
miseries
end
and
worship
begins
this
style
of
architecture
prevailed
till
the
twelfth
century
and
was
seen
in
its
greatest
perfection
in
germany
under
the
saxon
emperors
especially
in
the
rhenish
provinces
as
in
the
cathedrals
of
spires
mentz
worms
and
nuremberg
its
general
effect
was
gloomy
and
heavy
a
separation
from
the
outward
world
a
world
disgraced
by
feudal
wars
and
peasants
wrongs
and
general
ignorance
which
made
men
sad
morose
inhuman
it
flourished
in
ages
when
the
poor
had
no
redress
and
were
trodden
under
the
feet
of
hard
feudal
masters
when
there
was
no
law
but
of
brute
force
when
luxuries
were
few
and
comforts
rare
an
age
of
hardship
privation
poverty
suffering
an
age
of
isolations
and
sorrows
when
men
were
forced
to
look
beyond
the
grave
for
peace
and
hope
when
immortality
through
a
redeemer
was
the
highest
inspiration
of
life
everybody
was
agitated
by
fears
the
clergy
made
use
of
this
universal
feeling
by
presenting
the
terrors
of
the
law
the
penalty
of
sin
everlasting
physical
burnings
from
which
the
tortured
soul
could
be
extricated
only
by
penance
and
offerings
to
the
church
and
entire
subserviency
to
the
will
of
the
priest
who
held
the
keys
of
heaven
and
hell
the
men
who
lived
when
the
romanesque
churches
dotted
every
part
in
europe
looked
upon
society
and
saw
nothing
but
grief
heavy
burdens
injustices
oppressions
cruel
wrongs
and
they
hid
their
faces
and
wept
and
said
let
us
retreat
from
this
miserable
world
which
discord
ravages
let
us
hide
ourselves
in
contemplation
let
us
prepare
to
meet
god
in
judgment
let
us
bring
to
him
our
offering
let
us
propitiate
him
let
us
build
him
a
house
where
we
may
chant
our
mournful
songs
so
the
church
arises
in
germany
in
france
in
england
solemn
mystical
massive
a
type
of
sorrow
in
the
form
of
a
cross
with
a
sepulchral
crypt
like
the
man
in
the
tomb
before
the
lofty
spire
pointed
to
the
man
who
had
risen
to
heaven
the
church
is
still
struggling
and
is
not
jubilant
except
in
gregorian
chants
and
is
not
therefore
lofty
or
ornamental
it
is
a
vault
it
is
more
like
a
catacomb
than
a
basilica
for
the
world
is
buried
deep
in
sorrows
and
fears
look
to
any
of
the
saxon
churches
of
the
period
when
the
romanesque
prevailed
and
they
are
low
gloomy
and
damp
though
massive
and
solemn
the
church
as
an
edifice
ever
represents
the
church
as
an
institution
or
a
power
ever
typifies
prevailing
sentiments
and
ideas
perhaps
the
finest
of
the
old
romanesque
churches
was
that
of
cluny
in
burgundy
destroyed
during
the
french
revolution
it
had
five
aisles
and
was
five
hundred
and
twenty
feet
in
length
it
had
a
stately
tower
at
the
intersection
of
the
transepts
and
six
other
towers
it
was
early
norman
and
loftier
than
the
saxon
churches
although
heavy
and
massive
like
them
but
the
romanesque
church
with
all
its
varieties
is
still
gloomy
dark
sepulchral
reminding
us
of
the
sorrows
of
the
middle
ages
and
the
dreary
character
of
prevailing
religious
sentiments
fervent
sincere
profound
but
sad
the
sentiments
of
an
age
of
ignorance
and
faith
the
crusades
came
a
new
era
burst
upon
the
world
the
old
ideas
became
modified
society
became
more
cheerful
because
more
chivalric
adventurous
poetic
the
world
opened
towards
the
east
and
was
larger
than
was
before
supposed
liberality
of
mind
began
to
dawn
on
the
darkened
ages
no
longer
were
priests
supreme
the
gay
proven√ßals
began
to
sing
the
universities
began
to
teach
and
to
question
the
scholastic
philosophy
sent
forth
such
daring
thinkers
as
erigena
and
ab√©lard
orthodoxy
was
still
supreme
before
such
mighty
intellects
as
anselm
bernard
and
thomas
aquinas
but
it
was
assailed
ab√©lard
put
forth
his
puzzling
questions
the
schoolmen
began
to
think
for
themselves
and
the
iron
weight
of
feudalism
was
less
oppressive
free
cities
and
commerce
began
to
enrich
the
people
kings
were
becoming
more
powerful
grim
spiritual
despotism
was
less
arrogant
the
end
of
the
world
it
was
found
had
not
come
a
glorious
future
began
to
shed
forth
the
beams
of
its
coming
day
it
was
the
dawn
of
a
new
civilization
so
a
lighter
more
cheerful
and
grander
architecture
with
symbolic
beauties
appeared
with
changing
ideas
and
sentiments
the
church
no
longer
a
gloomy
power
struggling
with
saracens
and
barbarism
but
dominant
triumphant
issues
forth
from
darksome
crypts
and
soars
upward
elevates
her
vaulted
roofs
the
oriental
ogive
appears
the
architects
heap
arcade
on
arcade
ogive
on
ogive
pyramid
on
pyramid
and
give
to
all
geometrical
symmetry
and
artistic
grace
the
greek
column
is
there
but
dilated
to
colossal
proportions
and
exfoliated
in
a
variegated
capital
the
old
roman
arch
disappears
and
the
pointed
arch
is
substituted
graceful
and
elevated
the
old
egyptian
obelisk
appears
in
the
spire
reaching
to
heaven
full
of
aspiration
the
window
becomes
larger
and
encroaches
on
the
naked
wall
and
radiates
in
mystic
roses
the
arches
widen
and
the
piers
become
more
lofty
stained
glass
appears
and
diffuses
religious
light
every
part
of
the
church
becomes
decorated
and
symbolical
and
harmonious
though
infinitely
variegated
the
altars
have
pictures
over
them
shrines
and
monuments
appear
in
the
niches
the
dresses
of
the
priests
are
more
gorgeous
the
music
of
the
choir
peals
forth
hallelujahs
christ
is
risen
from
the
tomb
the
purple
of
his
blood
colors
the
windows
the
roof
like
pinnacles
and
spires
seems
to
reach
the
skies
the
pressure
of
the
walls
is
downwards
rather
than
lateral
the
vertical
lines
of
cologne
are
as
marked
as
the
old
horizontal
lines
of
the
parthenon
the
walls
too
are
not
so
heavy
and
are
supported
by
buttresses
which
give
increased
beauty
to
the
exterior
greater
light
and
shade
every
part
of
the
church
seems
to
press
forward
and
strive
for
greater
freedom
for
outward
manifestation
even
the
broad
and
expansive
window
presses
to
the
outer
surface
of
the
walls
now
broken
by
buttresses
and
pinnacles
the
window
the
eye
of
the
edifice
is
more
cheerful
and
intelligent
more
calm
is
the
imposing
fa√ßade
with
its
mighty
towers
and
lofty
spires
tapering
like
a
pyramid
with
its
round
oriel
window
rich
in
beautiful
tracery
and
its
wide
portal
with
sculptured
saints
and
martyrs
and
in
all
the
churches
you
see
geometrical
proportions
even
the
cross
of
the
church
is
deduced
from
the
figure
by
which
euclid
constructed
the
equilateral
triangle
the
columns
present
the
proportions
of
the
doric
as
to
diameter
and
height
the
love
of
the
true
and
beautiful
meet
the
natural
and
supernatural
both
appear
all
parts
symbolize
the
passion
of
christ
if
the
crypt
speaks
of
death
the
lofty
and
vaulted
roof
and
the
beautiful
pointed
arches
and
the
cheerful
window
and
the
jubilant
chants
speak
of
life
the
old
church
reminds
one
of
the
christ
that
lay
in
the
tomb
the
new
of
the
christ
who
arose
the
third
day
the
old
fosters
meditation
and
silence
the
new
kindles
the
imagination
by
its
variety
of
perspective
arrangement
and
mystic
representation
still
reverential
still
expressive
of
consecrated
sentiments
yet
more
cheerful
the
foliated
shaft
the
rich
tracery
of
the
window
the
graceful
pinnacle
the
arabian
gorgeousness
of
the
interior
as
if
the
crusaders
had
learned
something
from
the
east
the
innumerable
shrines
and
pictures
the
variegated
marbles
of
the
altar
with
its
vessels
of
silver
and
gold
the
splendid
dresses
of
the
priests
the
imposing
character
of
the
ritualism
the
treasures
lavished
everywhere
all
speak
greater
independence
wealth
and
power
the
church
takes
the
place
of
all
amusements
its
various
attractions
draw
together
the
people
from
their
farms
and
shops
they
are
gaily
dressed
as
if
they
were
attending
a
festival
their
condition
is
so
improved
that
they
have
time
for
holidays
and
these
the
church
multiplies
for
perpetual
toil
is
the
grave
of
intellect
the
people
must
have
rest
amusement
excitement
all
these
things
the
catholic
church
gives
and
consecrates
crusader
baron
knight
priest
peasant
all
resort
to
the
church
for
benedictions
women
too
are
there
and
in
greater
numbers
and
they
linger
for
the
confessional
when
the
time
comes
that
women
stay
away
from
church
like
busy
preoccupied
sceptical
men
then
let
us
be
on
the
watch
for
some
great
catastrophe
since
practical
paganism
will
then
be
restored
and
the
angels
of
light
will
have
left
the
earth
paris
and
its
neighborhood
was
the
cradle
of
this
new
development
of
architecture
which
we
wrongly
call
the
gothic
even
as
paris
was
the
centre
of
the
intelligence
of
the
era
the
word
gothic
suggests
destructive
barbarism
the
english
french
and
germans
descended
chiefly
from
normans
saxons
and
burgundians
this
form
of
church
architecture
rapidly
spreads
to
germany
england
and
spain
the
famous
suger
the
minister
of
a
powerful
king
built
the
abbey
of
denis
the
churches
of
rheims
paris
and
bourges
arose
in
all
their
grandeur
the
fa√ßade
of
rheims
is
the
most
significant
example
of
the
wonderful
architecture
of
the
thirteenth
century
in
the
church
of
amiens
you
see
the
perfection
of
the
gothic
so
graceful
are
its
details
so
dazzling
is
its
height
the
central
aisle
is
one
hundred
and
feet
in
altitude
only
surpassed
by
that
of
beauvais
which
is
fourteen
feet
higher
it
was
then
that
the
cathedral
of
rouen
was
built
with
its
elegant
lightness
a
marvel
to
modern
travellers
soon
after
the
cathedral
of
cologne
appears
more
grand
than
either
but
left
unfinished
with
its
central
aisle
feet
in
width
rising
one
hundred
and
forty
feet
into
the
air
with
its
colossal
towers
intended
to
support
the
slender
openwork
spires
five
hundred
and
twenty
feet
in
height
the
whole
church
is
five
hundred
and
feet
in
length
i
confess
this
church
made
a
greater
impression
on
my
mind
than
did
any
gothic
church
in
europe
more
even
than
milan
with
its
unnumbered
pinnacles
and
statues
and
its
marble
roof
i
could
not
rest
while
surveying
its
ten
thousand
wonders
so
much
lightness
combined
with
strength
so
grand
and
yet
so
cheerful
so
exquisitely
proportioned
so
complicated
in
details
and
yet
a
grand
unity
a
glorious
and
fit
temple
for
the
reverential
worship
of
the
deity
oh
how
grand
are
those
monuments
which
were
designed
to
last
through
ages
and
which
are
consecrated
not
to
traffic
not
to
pleasure
not
to
material
wealth
but
to
the
worship
of
that
almighty
god
to
whom
every
human
being
is
personally
responsible
i
can
not
enumerate
the
churches
of
mediaeval
europe
built
possibly
by
the
freemasons
certainly
by
men
familiar
with
all
that
is
practical
in
their
art
with
all
that
is
hallowed
and
poetical
i
glance
at
the
english
cathedrals
built
during
this
epoch
the
period
of
the
crusades
and
the
revival
of
learning
and
here
i
allude
to
the
man
who
furnishes
me
with
a
text
to
my
discourse
william
of
wykeham
chancellor
and
prime
minister
of
edward
the
contemporary
of
chaucer
and
wyclif
who
flourished
in
the
fourteenth
century
and
who
built
winchester
cathedral
a
great
and
benevolent
prelate
who
also
founded
other
colleges
and
schools
but
i
merely
allude
to
him
since
my
subject
is
the
art
to
which
he
gave
an
impulse
rather
than
any
single
individual
no
one
man
represents
church
architecture
any
more
appropriately
than
any
one
man
represents
the
feudal
system
or
monasticism
or
the
crusades
or
the
french
revolution
i
do
not
think
the
english
cathedrals
are
equal
to
those
of
cologne
rheims
amiens
and
rouen
but
they
are
full
of
interest
and
they
have
varied
excellences
that
of
salisbury
is
the
only
one
which
is
of
uniform
style
its
glory
is
in
its
spire
as
that
of
lincoln
is
in
its
west
front
and
that
of
westminster
is
in
its
nave
gloucester
is
celebrated
for
its
choir
and
york
for
its
tower
in
all
are
beautiful
vistas
of
pillars
and
arches
but
they
lack
the
inspiration
of
the
catholic
church
they
are
indeed
hoary
monuments
petrified
mysteries
a
passion
of
stone
as
michelet
speaks
of
the
marble
histories
which
will
survive
his
rhapsodies
they
alike
show
the
pilgrimage
of
humanity
through
gloomy
centuries
if
their
great
wooden
screens
were
removed
which
separate
the
choir
from
the
nave
the
cathedrals
doubtless
would
appear
to
more
advantage
and
especially
if
they
were
filled
with
altars
and
shrines
and
pictures
and
lighted
candles
on
the
altars
filled
also
with
crowds
of
worshippers
reverent
before
the
gorgeously
attired
ministers
of
divine
omnipotence
and
excited
by
transporting
chants
and
the
various
appeals
to
sense
and
imagination
the
reason
must
be
assisted
by
the
imagination
before
the
mind
can
revel
in
the
glories
of
gothic
architecture
imagination
intensifies
all
our
pleasures
even
those
of
sense
and
without
imagination
yea
a
memory
stored
with
the
pious
deeds
of
saints
and
martyrs
in
bygone
ages
a
gothic
cathedral
is
as
much
a
sealed
book
as
wordsworth
is
to
taine
the
protestant
tourist
from
michigan
or
pennsylvania
can
do
any
cathedral
in
two
hours
and
wonder
why
they
make
such
a
fuss
about
a
church
not
half
so
large
as
the
new
york
central
railroad
station
the
wonders
of
cathedrals
must
be
studied
like
the
glories
of
a
landscape
with
an
eye
to
the
beautiful
and
the
grand
cultured
and
practised
by
the
contemplation
of
ideal
excellence
when
the
mind
summons
the
imagination
to
its
aid
with
all
the
poetry
and
all
the
history
which
have
been
learned
in
a
life
of
leisure
and
study
how
different
the
emotions
of
a
ruskin
or
a
tennyson
in
surveying
those
costly
piles
from
those
of
a
man
fresh
from
a
distillery
or
from
a
warehouse
of
cotton
fabrics
or
even
from
those
of
many
fashionable
women
whose
only
aesthetic
accomplishment
is
to
play
languidly
and
mechanically
on
an
instrument
and
whose
only
intellectual
achievement
is
to
have
devoured
a
dozen
silly
novels
in
the
course
of
a
summer
spent
in
alternate
sleep
and
dalliance
nor
does
familiarity
always
give
a
zest
to
the
pleasure
which
arises
from
the
creations
of
art
or
the
glories
of
nature
the
roman
beggar
passes
the
coliseum
or
peter
without
notice
or
enjoyment
as
a
peasant
sees
unmoved
the
mountains
of
switzerland
or
the
beautiful
lakes
of
killarney
said
sorrowfully
my
guide
up
the
rhigi
i
wish
i
lived
in
holland
for
there
are
men
there
yet
there
are
those
whom
the
ascent
of
rhigi
and
the
ruined
monuments
of
ancient
rome
would
haunt
for
a
lifetime
in
whose
memory
they
would
be
perpetually
fresh
never
to
pass
away
any
more
than
the
looks
and
the
vows
of
early
love
from
the
mind
of
a
sentimental
woman
the
glorious
old
architecture
whose
peculiarity
was
the
pointed
arch
flourished
only
about
three
hundred
years
in
its
purity
and
matchless
beauty
then
another
change
took
place
the
ideal
became
lost
in
meaningless
ornaments
the
human
figure
peoples
the
naked
walls
man
places
his
own
image
everywhere
the
tomb
rises
like
a
mausoleum
in
side
chapels
man
is
enthroned
not
god
the
corruption
of
the
art
keeps
pace
with
the
corruption
of
the
papacy
and
the
discords
of
society
in
the
fourteenth
century
the
mediaeval
has
lost
its
charm
and
faith
and
then
sets
in
the
new
era
which
begins
with
michael
angelo
it
is
marked
by
the
revival
of
greek
art
and
greek
literature

ancient
art
regains
her
throne
and
wields
her
sceptre
over
the
worshippers
of
the
parthenon
and
the
admirers
of
aeschylus
and
thucydides
with
the
revived
statues
of
greece
appear
the
most
beautiful
pictures
ever
produced
by
the
hand
of
man
and
with
pictures
and
statues
architecture
receives
a
new
development
it
is
the
blending
of
the
old
greek
and
roman
with
the
gothic
and
is
called
the
renaissance
michael
angelo
erects
peter
the
heathen
pantheon
on
the
intersection
of
gothic
nave
and
choir
and
transept
a
glorious
dome
more
beautiful
than
any
gothic
spire
or
tower
rising
four
hundred
and
fifty
feet
into
the
air
and
in
the
interior
are
classic
circular
arches
and
pillars
so
vast
that
one
is
impressed
as
with
great
feats
of
engineering
skill
all
that
is
variegated
in
marbles
adorns
the
altars
all
that
is
bewitching
in
paintings
is
transferred
to
mosaics
and
this
new
style
of
italy
spreads
into
france
and
england
sir
christopher
wren
builds
paul
more
grecian
than
gothic
and
fills
london
with
new
churches
not
one
of
which
is
gothic
and
all
different
the
brain
is
bewildered
in
attempting
to
classify
the
new
and
forms
of
the
revived
italian
and
so
for
three
hundred
years
the
architects
mingle
the
gothic
with
the
classical
until
now
a
mongrel
architecture
is
the
disgrace
of
europe
varied
but
not
expressive
resting
on
no

neither
on

nor
on

corinthian

with

a
heap
of
diverse
forms
alien
alike
from
the
principles
of
wykeham
and
vitruvius
and
this
varied
mongrel
style
of
architecture
corresponds
with
the
confused
civilization
of
the
period
neither
greek
nor
gothic
but
a
mixture
of
both
intolerant
priests
wrangling

was
there
ever
such
a
simmering

and
fermenting
period
of
activities
since
the
world
began
in
such
a
wild
and
tumultuous
agitation
of
passions

how
could
art
reappear
either
in
the
classic
severity
of

the
hoary
grandeur
of

cathedrals
in
this
jumble
we
look
for
new
creations

no

in

appear
only
fantastic
imitations
there
is
no
creation

in
a
new

of

there
is

turned
into
great
feats
of
engineering
it
does
not
span
the
apsis
of
a
church
it
spans
rivers
and
valleys
the
church
indeed
passes
out
of
mind
if
not
out
of
sight
in
the
new
material
age
in
the
multiplication
of
bridges
and
gigantic
reservoirs
old
rome
brought
back
again
in
its
luxuries
and
yet
the
exactness
of
science
and
the
severity
of
criticism
begun
fifty
years
ago
in
the
verification
of
principles
produce
a
better
taste
architects
have
sought
to
revive
the
purest
forms
of
both
gothic
and
grecian
if
they
could
not
create
a
new
style
they
would
imitate
the
old
as
in
philosophy
they
would
go
round
in
the
old
circles
as
science
revives
the
atoms
of
democritus
so
art
would
reproduce
the
ideas
of
phidias
and
vitruvius
and
even
the
poetry
and
sanctity
of
the
middle
ages
within
fifty
years
christendom
has
been
covered
with
gothic
churches
some
of
which
are
as
beautiful
as
those
built
by
freemasons
the
cathedrals
have
been
copied
rigidly
even
for
village
churches
the
parthenon
reappears
in
the
madeleine
we
no
longer
see
as
in
the
eighteenth
century
gothic
spires
on
roman
basilicas
or
grecian
porticos
ornamenting
norman
towers
the
various
styles
of
two
thousand
years
are
not
mixed
up
in
the
same
building
we
copy
either
the
horizontal
lines
of
paganism
or
the
vertical
lines
of
the
ages
of
faith
no
more
harmonious
gothic
edifice
was
ever
erected
than
the
new
catholic
cathedral
of
new
york
the
only
absurdity
is
seen
when
radical
protestantism
adopts
the
church
of
pomps
and
liturgies
when
the
reformation
was
completed
men
sought
to
build
churches
where
they
could
hear
the
voice
of
the
preacher
for
the
mission
of
protestantism
is
to
teach
not
to
sing
protestantism
glories
in
its
sermons
as
much
as
catholicism
in
its
chants
if
the
people
wish
to
return
again
to
ritualism
let
them
have
the
gothic
church
if
they
wish
to
be
electrified
by
eloquence
let
them
have
a
basilica
for
the
voice
of
the
preacher
is
lost
in
high
and
vaulted
roofs
if
they
wish
to
join
in
the
prayers
and
the
ceremonies
of
the
altar
let
them
have
the
clustering
pillars
and
the
purple
windows
everything
turns
upon
what
is
meant
by
a
church
what
is
it
for
is
it
for
liturgical
services
or
is
it
for
pulpit
eloquence
solve
that
question
and
you
solve
the
reformation
my
house
saith
the
divine
voice
shall
be
called
the
house
of
prayer
it
is
by
the
foolishness
of
preaching
said
paul
that
men
are
saved
if
you
will
have
the
prayers
of
the
middle
ages
and
the
sermons
of
the
reformation
both
together
then
let
the
architects
invent
a
new
style
which
shall
allow
the
blending
of
prayer
and
pulpit
eloquence
you
can
not
have
them
both
in
a
grecian
temple
or
in
a
gothic
church
you
must
combine
the
parthenon
with
salisbury
which
is
virtually
a
new
miracle
of
architecture
will
that
miracle
be
wrought
i
do
not
know
but
a
modern
protestant
church
with
all
the
wonders
of
our
modern
civilization
must
be
something
new
some
new
combination
which
shall
be
worthy
of
the
necessity
of
our
times
this
is
what
the
architect
must
now
aspire
to
accomplish
he
must
produce
a
house
in
which
one
can
both
hear
the
sermon
and
be
stimulated
by
inspiring
melodies
for
the
church
must
have
both
the
psalms
of
david
and
the
chants
of
gregory
must
be
blended
with
the
fervid
words
of
a
chrysostom
and
a
chalmers
this
at
least
should
be
borne
in
mind
the
church
edifice
be
adapted
to
the
end
designed
the
gothic
architects
adapted
their
vaults
and
pillars
to
the
ceremonies
of
the
catholic
ritual
if
it
is
this
you
want
then
copy
gothic
cathedrals
but
if
it
is
preaching
you
want
then
restore
the
grecian
temple
or
better
still
the
roman
theatre
where
the
voice
of
the
preacher
is
not
lost
either
in
byzantine
domes
or
gothic
vaults
whose
height
is
greater
than
their
width
the
preacher
must
draw
by
the
distinctness
of
his
tones
for
every
preacher
has
not
the
musical
voice
of
chrysostom
or
the
electricity
of
bernard
he
can
neither
draw
nor
inspire
if
he
can
not
be
heard
he
speaks
to
stones
not
to
living
men
or
women
he
loses
his
power
and
is
driven
to
chants
and
music
to
keep
his
audience
from
deserting
him
he
must
make
his
choir
an
orchestra
he
must
hide
himself
in
priestly
vestments
he
must
import
opera
singers
to
amuse
and
not
instruct
he
can
not
instruct
when
he
can
not
be
heard
and
heard
easily
unless
the
people
catch
every
tone
of
his
voice
his
electricity
will
be
wasted
and
he
will
preach
in
vain
and
be
tired
out
by
attempting
to
prevent
echoes
the
voice
of
saint
paul
would
be
lost
in
some
of
our
modern
fashionable
churches
think
of
the
absurdity
of
baptists
and
methodists
and
presbyterians
affecting
to
restore
gothic
monuments
when
the
great
end
of
sacred
eloquence
is
lost
in
those
devices
which
appeal
to
sense
think
of
the
folly
of
erecting
a
church
for
eight
hundred
people
as
high
as
westminster
abbey
it
is
not
the
size
of
a
church
which
prevents
the
speaker
from
being
heard
it
is
the
disproportion
of
height
with
breadth
and
length
and
the
echoes
produced
by
arcades
spurgeon
is
heard
easily
by
seven
thousand
people
and
talmage
by
six
thousand
and
hall
by
four
thousand
because
the
buildings
in
which
they
preach
are
adapted
to
public
speaking
those
who
erect
theatres
take
care
that
a
great
crowd
shall
be
able
to
catch
even
the
whispers
of
actors
what
would
you
think
of
the
good
sense
and
judgment
of
an
architect
who
should
construct
a
reservoir
that
would
leak
in
order
to
make
it
ornamental
or
a
schoolhouse
without
ventilation
or
a
theatre
where
actors
could
only
be
seen
or
a
hotel
without
light
and
convenient
rooms
or
a
railroad
bridge
which
would
not
support
a
heavy
weight
a
protestant
church
is
designed
no
matter
what
the
sect
may
be
to
which
it
belongs
not
for
poetical
or
aesthetic
purposes
not
for
the
admiration
of
architectural
expenditures
not
even
for
music
but
for
earnest
people
to
hear
from
the
preacher
the
words
of
life
and
death
that
they
may
be
aroused
by
his
enthusiasm
or
instructed
by
his
wisdom
where
the
poor
are
not
driven
to
a
few
back
seats
in
the
gallery
where
the
meeting
is
cheerful
and
refreshing
where
all
are
stimulated
to
duties
it
must
not
be
dark
damp
and
gloomy
where
it
is
necessary
to
light
the
gas
on
a
foggy
day
and
where
one
must
be
within
ten
feet
of
the
preacher
to
see
the
play
of
his
features
take
away
facilities
for
hearing
and
even
for
seeing
the
preacher
and
the
vitality
of
a
protestant
service
is
destroyed
and
the
end
for
which
the
people
assemble
is
utterly
defeated
moreover
you
destroy
the
sacred
purposes
of
a
church
if
you
make
it
so
expensive
that
the
poor
can
not
get
sittings
nothing
is
so
dull
depressing
funereal
as
a
church
occupied
only
by
prosperous
who
come
together
to
show
their
faces
and
prove
their
respectability
rather
than
to
join
in
the
paeans
of
redemption
or
to
learn
humiliating
lessons
of
worldly
power
before
the
altar
of
omnipotence
to
the
poor
the
gospel
is
preached
and
it
is
ever
the
common
people
who
hear
most
gladly
gospel
truth
ah
who
are
the
common
people
i
fancy
we
are
all
common
people
when
we
are
sick
or
in
bereavement
or
in
adversity
or
when
we
come
to
die
but
if
advancing
society
based
on
material
wealth
and
epicurean
pleasure
demands
churches
for
the
rich
and
churches
for
the
poor
if
the
lines
of
society
must
be
drawn
somewhere
let
those
architects
be
employed
who
understand
at
least
the
first
principles
of
their
art
i
do
not
mean
those
who
learn
to
draw
pictures
in
the
back
room
of
a
studio
but
conscientious
men
if
you
can
not
find
sensible
men
and
let
the
pulpit
itself
be
situated
where
the
people
can
hear
the
speaker
easily
without
straining
their
eyes
and
ears
then
only
will
the
speaker
voice
ring
and
kindle
and
inspire
those
who
come
together
to
hear
god
message
then
only
will
he
be
truly
eloquent
and
successful
since
then
only
does
his
own
electricity
permeate
the
whole
mass
then
only
can
he
be
effective
and
escape
the
humiliation
of
being
only
a
part
of
a
vain
show
where
his
words
are
disregarded
and
his
strength
is
wasted
in
the
echoes
of
vaults
and
recesses
copied
from
the
gloomy
though
beautiful
monuments

never
never

john
wyclif
dawn
of
the
reformation
the
name
of
wyclif
suggests
the
dawn
of
the
protestant
reformation
and
the
reformation
suggests
the
existence
of
evils
which
made
it
a
necessity
i
do
not
look
upon
the
reformation
in
its
earlier
stages
as
a
theological
movement
in
fact
the
catholic
and
protestant
theology
as
expounded
and
systematized
by
great
authorities
does
not
materially
differ
from
that
of
the
fathers
of
the
church
the
doctrines
of
augustine
were
accepted
equally
by
thomas
aquinas
and
john
calvin
what
is
called
systematic
divinity
as
taught
in
our
theological
seminaries
is
a
series
of
deductions
from
the
writings
of
paul
and
other
apostles
elaborately
and
logically
drawn
by
athanasius
jerome
augustine
and
other
lights
of
the
early
church
which
were
defended
in
the
middle
ages
with
amazing
skill
and
dialectical
acuteness
by
the
scholastic
doctors
with
the
aid
of
the
method
which
aristotle
the
greatest
logician
of
antiquity
bequeathed
to
philosophy
neither
luther
nor
calvin
departed
essentially
from
these
great
deductions
on
such
vital
subjects
as
the
existence
and
attributes
of
god
the
trinity
sin
and
its
penalty
redemption
grace
and
predestination
the
creeds
of
modern
protestant
churches
are
in
harmony
with
the
writings
of
both
the
fathers
and
the
scholastic
doctors
on
the
fundamental
principles
of
christianity
there
are
indeed
some
ideas
in
reference
to
worship
and
the
sacraments
and
the
government
of
the
church
and
aids
to
a
religious
life
defended
by
the
scholastic
doctors
which
protestants
do
not
accept
and
for
which
there
is
not
much
authority
in
the
writings
of
the
fathers
but
the
main
difference
between
protestants
and
catholics
is
in
reference
to
the
institutions
of
the
church
institutions
which
gradually
arose
with
the
triumph
of
christianity
in
its
contest
with
paganism
and
which
received
their
full
development
in
the
middle
ages
it
was
the
enormous
and
scandalous
corruptions
which
crept
into
these
which
led
to
the
cry
for
reform
it
was
the
voice
of
wyclif
denouncing
these
abuses
which
made
him
famous
and
placed
him
in
the
van
of
reformers
these
abuses
were
generally
admitted
and
occasionally
attacked
by
churchmen
and
laymen
alike
even
by
the
poets
they
were
too
flagrant
to
be
denied
now
what
were
the
prominent
evils
in
the
institutions
of
the
church
which
called
for
reform
and
in
reference
to
which
wyclif
raised
up
his
voice
for
in
his
day
there
was
only
church
an
enumeration
of
these
is
necessary
before
we
can
appreciate
the
labors
and
teachings
of
the
reformer
i
can
only
state
them
i
can
not
enlarge
upon
them
i
state
only
what
is
indisputable
not
in
reference
to
theological
dogmas
so
much
as
to
morals
and
ecclesiastical
abuses
the
centre
and
life
and
support
of
all
was
the
papacy
an
institution
a
great
government
not
a
religion
i
have
spoken
of
this
great
power
as
built
up
by
leo
gregory
and
innocent
and
by
others
whom
i
have
not
mentioned
so
much
may
be
said
of
the
necessity
of
a
central
spiritual
power
in
the
dark
ages
of
european
society
that
i
shall
not
combat
this
power
or
stigmatize
it
with
offensive
epithets
the
necessities
of
the
times
probably
called
it
into
existence
like
other
governments
although
i
can
not
see
any
argument
drawn
from
the
scriptures
or
from
the
history
of
the
early
apostolic
church
to
warrant
its
existence
nor
would
i
defend
the
long
series
of
papal
usurpations
by
which
the
roman
pontiffs
got
possession
of
the
government
of
both
church
and
state
i
speak
not
of
their
quarrels
with
princes
about
investitures
in
which
their
genius
and
their
heroism
were
displayed
rather
than
by
efforts
in
behalf
of
civilization
but
the
popes
exercised
certain
powers
and
prerogatives
in
england
about
the
time
of
wyclif
which
were
exceedingly
offensive
to
the
secular
rulers
of
the
land
they
claimed
the
island
as
a
sort
of
property
which
reason
and
the
laws
did
not
justify
a
claim
which
led
to
heavy
exactions
and
forced
contributions
on
the
english
people
that
crippled
the
government
and
impoverished
the
nation
boys
and
favorites
were
appointed
by
the
popes
to
important
posts
and
livings
church
preferments
were
almost
exclusively
in
the
hands
of
the
pope
and
these
were
often
bought
a
yearly
tribute
had
been
forced
on
the
nation
in
the
time
of
john
peter
pence
were
collected
from
the
people
enormous
sums
under
various
pretences
flowed
to
rome
and
the
clergy
were
taxed
as
well
as
the
laity
the
contributions
which
were
derived
from
the
sale
of
benefices
from
investitures
from
the
transfer
of
sees
from
the
bestowal
of
rings
and
crosiers
badges
of
episcopal
authority
from
the
confirmation
of
elections
and
other
taxes
irritated
sovereigns
and
called
out
the
severest
denunciation
of
statesmen
closely
connected
with
papal
exactions
was
the
enormous
increase
of
the
mendicant
friars
especially
the
dominicans
and
franciscans
who
had
been
instituted
by
innocent
iii
to
uphold
the
papal
domination
these
itinerating
beggars
in
their
gowns
infested
every
town
and
village
in
england
for
a
century
after
their
institution
they
were
the
ablest
and
perhaps
the
best
soldiers
of
the
pope
and
did
what
the
jesuits
afterwards
performed
and
perhaps
the
methodists
a
hundred
years
ago
gained
the
hearts
of
the
people
and
stimulated
religious
life
but
in
the
fourteenth
century
they
were
a
nuisance
they
sold
indulgences
they
invented
pious
frauds
they
were
covetous
under
pretence
of
poverty
they
had
become
luxurious
in
their
lives
they
slandered
the
regular
clergy
they
usurped
the
prerogatives
of
parish
priests
they
enriched
their
convents
they
accommodated
themselves
to
the
wishes
of
the
great
and
were
marked
by
those
peculiarities
of
which
the
jesuits
were
accused
in
the
time
of
pascal
as
they
had
not
in
england
as
in
spain
and
italy
tribunals
of
inquisition
they
were
ridiculed
despised
and
hated
rather
than
feared
one
gets
the
truest
impression
of
the
popular
estimate
of
these
friars
from
the
sarcasms
of
chaucer
the
friar
tuck
whom
sir
walter
scott
has
painted
was
a
very
different
man
from
the
dominicans
or
the
franciscans
of
the
thirteenth
century
when
they
reigned
in
the
universities
and
were
the
confessors
of
monarchs
and
the
most
popular
preachers
of
their
time
in
the
fourteenth
century
they
were
consumed
with
jealousies
and
rivalries
and
animosities
against
each
other
and
all
the
various
orders
dominican
franciscan
carmelite
in
spite
of
their
professions
of
poverty
were
the
possessors
of
magnificent
monasteries
and
fattened
on
the
credulity
of
the
world
besides
these
mendicant
friars
england
was
dotted
with
convents
and
religious
houses
belonging
to
the
different
orders
of
benedictines
which
though
enormously
rich
devoured
the
substance
of
the
poor
there
were
more
than
twenty
thousand
monks
in
a
population
of
three
or
four
millions
and
most
of
them
led
idle
and
dissolute
lives

were
subjects

perpetual
reproach

the
various
religious
houses
had
been
attempted
but
all
reforms
had
failed
nor
were
the
lives
of
the
secular
clergy
much
more
respectable
than
those
of
the
great
body
of
monks
they
are
accused
by
all
historians
of
avarice
venality
dissoluteness
and
ignorance
and
it
was
their
incapacity
their
disregard
of
duties
and
indifference
to
the
spiritual
interests
of
their
flocks
that
led
to
the
immense
popularity
of
the
mendicant
friars
until
they
in
their
turn
became
perhaps
a
greater
scandal
than
the
parish
priests
whose
functions
they
had
usurped
both
priests
and
monks
in
the
time
of
bishop
grost√™te
of
lincoln
frequented
taverns
and
so
enormous
and
scandalous
was
the
wealth
of
the
clergy
that
as
early
as
under
edward
parliament
passed
a
statute
of
mortmain
forbidding
religious
bodies
to
receive
bequests
without
the
king
license
with
the
increase
of
scandalous
vices
among
the
clergy
was
a
corruption
in
the
doctrines
of
the
church
not
those
which
are
strictly
theological
but
those
which
pertained
to
the
sacraments
and
the
conditions
on
which
absolution
was
given
and
communion
administered
in
the
thirteenth
century
as
the
scholastic
philosophy
was
reaching
its
fullest
development
we
notice
the
establishment
of
the
doctrine
of
transubstantiation
the
withholding
the
cup
from
the
laity
and
the
necessity
of
confession
as
the
condition
of
receiving
the
communion
which
corruptions
increased
amazingly
the
power
of
the
clergy
over
the
minds
of
superstitious
people
and
led
to
still
more
flagrant
evils
like
the
sale
of
indulgences
and
the
perversion
of
the
doctrine
of
penance
originally
enforced
in
order
to
aid
the
soul
to
overcome
the
tyranny
of
the
body
but
finally
accepted
as
the
expiation
for
sin
so
that
the
door
of
heaven
itself
was
opened
by
venal
priests
only
to
those
whom
they
could
control
or
rob
such
was
the
state
of
the
church
when
wyclif
was
born
in
near
richmond
in
yorkshire
about
a
century
after
the
establishment
of
universities
the
creation
of
the
mendicant
orders
and
the
memorable
usurpation
of
innocent
iii
in
the
year
during
the
reign
of
edward
we
find
him
at
the
age
of
sixteen
a
student
in
merton
college
at
oxford
the
college
then
most
distinguished
for
scholastic
doctors
the
college
of
islip
of
bradwardine
of
occam
and
perhaps
of
duns
scotus
it
would
seem
that
wyclif
devoted
himself
with
great
assiduity
to
the
study
which
gave
the
greatest
intellectual
position
and
influence
in
the
middle
ages
and
which
required
a
training
of
nineteen
years
in
dialectics
before
the
high
degree
of
doctor
of
divinity
was
conferred
by
the
university
we
know
nothing
of
his
studious
life
at
oxford
until
he
received
his
degree
with
the
title
of
evangelical
or
gospel
doctor
from
which
we
infer
that
he
was
a
student
of
the
bible
and
was
more
remarkable
for
his
knowledge
of
the
scriptures
than
for
his
dialectical
skill
but
even
for
his
knowledge
of
the
scholastic
philosophy
he
was
the
most
eminent
man
in
the
university
and
he
was
as
familiar
with
the
writings
of
saint
augustine
and
jerome
as
with
those
of
aristotle
it
was
not
then
the
fashion
to
study
the
text
of
the
scriptures
so
much
as
the
commentaries
upon
it
and
he
who
was
skilled
in
the
book
of
sentences
and
the
summa
theologica
stood
a
better
chance
of
preferment
than
he
who
had
mastered
saint
paul
but
wyclif
it
would
seem
was
distinguished
for
his
attainments
in
everything
which
commanded
the
admiration
of
his
age
in
when
he
was
he
wrote
a
tract
on
the
last
ages
of
the
church
in
view
of
the
wretchedness
produced
by
the
great
plague
eight
years
before
in
at
the
age
of
he
attacked
the
mendicant
orders
and
his
career
as
a
reformer
began
an
unsuccessful
reformer
indeed
like
john
huss
since
the
evils
which
he
combated
were
not
removed
he
merely
protested
against
the
corruptions
which
good
men
lamented
and
that
is
nearly
all
that
great
men
can
do
when
they
are
beyond
their
age
they
are
simply
witnesses
of
truth
and
fortunate
are
they
if
they
do
not
die
as
martyrs
for
in
the
early
church
witnesses
and
martyrs
were
synonymous
greek
the
year
following
wyclif
was
presented
to
the
rich
rectory
of
fillingham
by
baliol
college
and
was
promoted
the
same
year
to
the
wardenship
of
that
ancient
college
the
learned
doctor
is
now
one
of
the
dons
of
the
university
at
that
time
even
more
than
now
a
great
dignitary
it
would
be
difficult
for
an
unlearned
politician
of
the
nineteenth
century
to
conceive
of
the
exalted
position
which
a
dignitary
of
the
church
crowned
with
scholastic
honors
held
five
hundred
years
ago
it
gave
him
access
to
the
table
of
his
sovereign
and
to
the
halls
of
parliament
it
made
him
an
oracle
in
all
matters
of
the
law
it
created
for
him
a
hearing
on
all
the
great
political
as
well
as
ecclesiastical
issues
of
the
day
what
great
authorities
in
the
thirteenth
century
were
albertus
magnus
thomas
aquinas
and
bonaventura
scarcely
less
than
they
in
the
next
century
were
duns
scotus
and
john
wyclif
far
greater
in
influence
than
any
of
the
proud
feudal
lords
who
rendered
service
to
edward
broad
as
were
their
acres
and
grand
as
were
their
castles
strange
as
it
may
seem
the
glory
that
radiated
from
the
brow
of
a
scholar
or
a
saint
was
greatest
in
ages
of
superstition
and
darkness
perhaps
because
both
scholars
and
saints
were
rare
the
modern
lights
of
learning
may
be
better
paid
than
in
former
days
but
they
do
not
stand
out
to
the
eye
of
admiring
communities
in
such
prominence
as
they
did
among
our
ancestors
who
stops
and
turns
back
to
gaze
reverentially
on
a
poet
or
a
scholar
whom
he
passes
by
unconsciously
as
both
men
and
women
strained
their
eyes
to
see
an
ab√©lard
or
a
dante
even
a
webster
now
would
not
command
the
homage
he
received
fifty
years
ago
it
is
not
uninteresting
to
contemplate
the
powers
that
have
ruled
in
successive
ages
outside
the
realms
of
conquerors
and
kings
in
the
ninth
and
tenth
centuries
they
were
baronial
lords
in
armor
in
the
eleventh
and
twelfth
centuries
these
powers
like
those
of
ancient
egypt
were
priests
in
the
thirteenth
and
fourteenth
centuries
they
were
the
learned
doctors
as
in
the
schools
of
athens
when
political
supremacy
was
lost
in
the
sixteenth
century
the
era
of
reforms
they
were
controversial
theologians
like
those
of
the
age
of
theodosius
in
the
seventeenth
century
they
were
fighting
nobles
in
the
eighteenth
they
were
titled
and
hereditary
courtiers
and
great
landed
proprietors
in
the
nineteenth
they
are
bankers
merchants
and
railway
presidents
men
who
control
the
material
interests
of
the
country
it
is
only
at
elections
though
managed
by
politicians
that
the
people
are
a
power
socially
the
magnates
are
the
rich
it
is
money
which
in
these
times
all
classes
combine
to
worship
if
this
be
questioned
see
the
adulation
which
even
colleges
and
schools
of
learning
pay
to
their
wealthy
patrons
or
those
from
whom
they
seek
benefits
the
patrons
of
the
schools
in
the
middle
ages
were
princes
and
nobles
but
these
princes
and
nobles
bowed
down
in
reverence
to
learned
bishops
and
great
theological
doctors
wyclif
was
the
representative
of
the
schools
when
he
attacked
the
abuses
of
the
church
it
is
not
a
little
singular
that
the
great
religious
movements
in
england
have
generally
come
from
oxford
while
cambridge
has
been
distinguished
for
great
movements
in
science
in
he
was
appointed
to
the
headship
of
canterbury
hall
founded
by
archbishop
islip
afterwards
merged
into
christ
church
the
most
magnificent
and
wealthy
of
all
the
oxford
colleges
when
islip
died
in
and
langham
originally
a
monk
of
canterbury
was
made
archbishop
the
appointment
of
wyclif
was
pronounced
void
by
langham
and
the
revenues
of
the
hall
of
which
he
was
warden
or
president
were
sequestered
wyclif
on
this
appealed
to
the
pope
who
however
ratified
decree
as
it
would
be
expected
for
the
pope
sustained
the
friars
whom
wyclif
had
denounced
the
spirit
of
such
a
progressive
man
was
of
course
offensive
to
the
head
of
the
church
in
this
case
the
crown
confirmed
the
decision
of
the
pope
since
the
royal
license
was
obtained
by
a
costly
bribe
the
whole
transaction
was
so
iniquitous
that
wyclif
could
not
restrain
his
indignation
but
before
this
decision
of
the
crown
was
made
the
services
of
wyclif
had
been
accepted
by
the
parliament
in
its
resistance
to
the
claim
which
pope
urban
had
made
in
to
the
arrears
of
tribute
due
under
john
vassalage
edward
iii
had
referred
this
claim
to
parliament
and
the
parliament
had
rejected
it
without
hesitation
on
the
ground
that
john
had
no
power
to
bind
the
realm
without
its
consent
the
parliament
was
the
mere
mouthpiece
of
wyclif
who
was
now
actively
engaged
in
political
life
and
probably
as
lechler
thinks
had
a
seat
in
parliament
he
was
at
any
rate
a
very
prominent
political
character
for
he
was
sent
in
to
bruges
as
one
of
the
commissioners
to
treat
with
the
representatives
of
the
french
pope
in
reference
to
the
appointment
of
foreigners
to
the
rich
benefices
of
the
church
in
england
which
gave
great
offence
to
the
liberal
and
popular
party
in
england
for
there
was
such
a
progressive
party
as
early
as
the
fourteenth
century
although
it
did
not
go
by
that
name
and
was
not
organized
as
parties
are
now
in
fact
in
all
ages
and
countries
there
are
some
men
who
are
before
their
contemporaries
the
great
grievance
of
which
the
more
advanced
and
enlightened
complained
was
the
interference
of
the
pope
with
ecclesiastical
livings
in
england
wyclif
led
the
opposition
to
this
usurpation
and
this
opposition
to
the
pope
on
the
part
of
a
churchman
made
it
necessary
for
him
to
have
a
protector
powerful
enough
to
shield
him
from
papal
vengeance
this
protector
he
found
in
john
of
gaunt
duke
of
lancaster
who
next
to
the
king
had
the
greatest
authority
in
england
it
is
probable
that
wyclif
enjoyed
at
bruges
the
friendship
of
this
great
man
great
for
his
station
influence
and
birth
at
least
who
was
at
the
head
of
the
opposition
to
the
papal
claims
resisted
not
only
by
him
but
by
parliament
which
seems
to
have
been
composed
of
men
in
advance
of
their
age
as
early
as
this
parliament
had
petitioned
the
king
to
exclude
all
ecclesiastics
from
the
great
offices
of
state
held
almost
exclusively
by
them
as
the
most
able
and
learned
people
of
the
realm
from
the
time
of
alfred
this
custom
had
not
been
seriously
opposed
by
the
baronial
lords
who
were
ignorant
and
unenlightened
but
in
the
fourteenth
century
light
had
broken
in
upon
the
darkness
the
day
had
at
least
dawned
and
the
absurdity
of
confining
the
cares
of
state
and
temporal
matters
to
men
who
ought
to
be
absorbed
with
spiritual
duties
alone
was
seen
by
the
more
enlightened
of
the
laity
but
the
king
was
not
then
prepared
to
part
with
the
most
efficient
of
his
ministers
because
they
happened
to
be
ecclesiastics
and
the
custom
continued
for
nearly
two
centuries
longer
bishop
williams
was
the
last
of
the
clergy
who
filled
the
great
office
of
chancellor
and
archbishop
laud
was
the
last
of
the
clergy
who
became
a
prime
minister
the
reign
of
elizabeth
was
marked
for
the
first
time
in
the
history
of
england
by
the
almost
total
exclusion
of
prelates
from
great
secular
offices
in
the
reign
of
edward
iii
it
was
william
of
wykeham
bishop
of
winchester
who
held
the
great
seal
and
the
bishop
of
exeter
who
was
lord
treasurer
probably
the
two
men
in
the
whole
realm
who
were
the
most
experienced
in
public
affairs
as
men
of
business
wyclif
it
would
appear
although
he
was
an
ecclesiastic
here
took
the
side
of
parliament
against
his
own
order
in
his
treatise
on
the
regimen
of
the
church
he
contends
that
neither
doctors
nor
deacons
should
hold
secular
offices
or
even
be
land
stewards
and
clerks
of
account
and
appeals
to
the
authority
of
the
fathers
and
saint
paul
in
confirmation
of
his
views
at
this
time
he
was
a
doctor
of
divinity
and
professor
of
theology
in
the
university
having
been
promoted
to
this
high
position
in
two
years
before
he
was
sent
as
commissioner
to
bruges
in
he
was
presented
to
the
rectory
of
lutterworth
in
leicestershire
by
the
crown
in
reward
for
his
services
as
an
ambassador
in
parliament
renewed
its
assault
on
pontifical
pretensions
and
exactions
and
there
was
cause
since
twenty
thousand
marks
or
pounds
were
sent
annually
to
rome
from
the
pope
collector
in
england
which
collector
was
a
frenchman
another
indignity
against
these
corruptions
and
usurpations
wyclif
was
unsparing
in
his
denunciations
and
the
hierarchy
at
last
were
compelled
by
their
allegiance
to
rome
to
take
measures
to
silence
and
punish
him
as
a
pertinacious
heretic
the
term
heretic
meant
in
those
days
opposition
to
papal
authority
as
much
as
opposition
to
the
theological
dogmas
of
the
church
and
the
brand
of
heresy
was
the
greatest
stigma
which
authority
could
impose
the
bold
denunciator
of
papal
abuses
was
now
in
danger
he
was
summoned
by
the
convocation
to
appear
in
saint
paul
cathedral
and
answer
for
his
heresies
on
which
occasion
were
present
the
archbishop
of
canterbury
and
the
arrogant
bishop
of
london
the
latter
the
son
of
the
earl
of
devonshire
of
the
great
family
of
the
courtenays
wyclif
was
attended
by
the
duke
of
lancaster
and
the
earl
marshal
henry
percy
the
ancestor
of
the
dukes
of
northumberland
who
forced
themselves
into
the
lady
chapel
behind
the
high
altar
where
the
prelates
were
assembled
an
uproar
followed
from
this
unusual
intrusion
of
the
two
most
powerful
men
of
the
kingdom
into
the
very
sanctuary
of
prelatic
authority
what
could
be
done
when
the
great
oxford
professor
the
most
learned
scholastic
of
the
kingdom
was
protected
by
a
royal
duke
clothed
with
viceregal
power
and
the
earl
marshal
armed
with
the
sword
of
state
the
position
of
wyclif
was
as
strong
as
it
was
before
he
was
attacked
nor
could
he
be
silenced
except
by
the
authority
of
the
pope
himself
still
acknowledged
as
the
supreme
lord
of
christendom
and
the
pope
now
felt
that
he
must
assert
his
supremacy
and
interpose
his
supreme
authority
or
lose
his
hold
on
england
so
he
hurled
his
weapons
not
yet
impotent
and
fulminated
his
bulls
ordering
the
university
under
penalty
of
excommunication
to
deliver
the
daring
heretic
into
the
hands
of
the
archbishop
of
canterbury
or
the
bishop
of
london
and
further
commanding
these
two
prelates
to
warn
the
king
against
the
errors
of
wyclif
and
to
examine
him
as
to
his
doctrines
and
keep
him
in
chains
until
the
pope
pleasure
should
be
further
known
in
addition
to
these
bulls
the
pope
sent
one
to
the
king
himself
it
was
resolved
that
the
work
should
be
thoroughly
done
this
time
yet
it
would
appear
that
these
various
bulls
threatening
an
interdict
did
not
receive
a
welcome
from
any
quarter
the
prelates
did
not
wish
to
quarrel
with
such
an
antagonist
as
the
duke
of
lancaster
who
was
now
the
chief
power
in
the
state
the
king
being
in
his
last
illness
they
allowed
several
months
to
pass
before
executing
their
commission
during
which
wyclif
was
consulted
by
the
great
council
of
state
whether
they
should
allow
money
to
be
carried
out
of
the
realm
at
the
pope
demands
and
he
boldly
declared
that
they
should
not
thus
coming
in
direct
antagonism
with
hierarchal
power
he
also
wrote
at
this
time
pamphlets
vindicating
himself
from
the
charges
made
against
him
asserting
the
invalidity
of
unjust
excommunication
which
if
allowed
would
set
the
pope
above
god
at
last
after
seven
months
the
prelates
took
courage
and
ordered
the
university
to
execute
the
papal
bulls
to
imprison
wyclif
at
the
command
of
the
pope
would
be
to
allow
the
pope
temporal
rule
in
england
yet
to
disobey
the
bulls
would
be
disregard
of
the
papal
power
altogether
in
this
dilemma
the
himself
a
monk
ordered
a
nominal
imprisonment
the
result
of
these
preliminary
movements
was
that
wyclif
appeared
at
lambeth
before
the
archbishop
to
answer
his
accusers
the
great
prelates
had
a
different
spirit
from
the
university
which
was
justly
proud
of
its
most
learned
doctor
a
man
too
beyond
his
age
in
his
progressive
spirit
for
the
universities
in
those
days
were
not
so
conservative
as
they
subsequently
became
at
lambeth
wyclif
found
unexpected
support
from
the
people
of
london
who
broke
into
the
archiepiscopal
chapel
and
interrupted
the
proceedings
and
a
still
more
efficient
aid
from
the
queen
dowager
the
princess
joan
who
sent
a
message
forbidding
any
sentence
against
wyclif
thus
was
he
backed
by
royal
authority
and
the
popular
voice
as
luther
was
afterwards
in
saxony
the
prelates
were
overcome
with
terror
and
dropped
the
proceedings
while
the
of
oxford
who
had
tardily
and
imperfectly
obeyed
the
pope
was
cast
into
prison
for
a
time
and
compelled
to
resign
his
office
wyclif
had
gained
a
great
triumph
which
he
used
by
publishing
a
summary
of
his
opinions
in
articles
both
in
latin
and
english
in
these
it
would
seem
that
he
attacked
the
infallibility
of
the
pope
liable
to
sin
like
any
other
person
and
hence
to
be
corrected
by
the
voices
of
those
who
are
faithful
to
a
higher
power
than
his
a
blow
to
the
exercise
of
excommunication
from
any
personal
grounds
of
malice
or
hatred
or
when
used
to
extort
unjust
or
mercenary
demands
he
also
maintained
that
the
endowments
of
the
clergy
could
be
lawfully
withdrawn
if
they
were
perverted
or
abused
a
bold
assertion
in
his
day
but
which
he
professed
he
was
willing
to
defend
even
unto
death
if
the
prelates
had
dared
or
had
possessed
sufficient
power
he
would
doubtless
have
suffered
death
from
their
animosity
but
he
was
left
unmolested
in
his
retirement
at
his
rectory
although
he
kept
himself
discreetly
out
of
the
way
of
danger
when
the
memorable
schism
took
place
in
the
roman
government
by
the
election
of
an
and
both
popes
proclaimed
a
crusade
and
issued
their
indulgences
wyclif
who
heretofore
had
admitted
the
primacy
of
the
roman
see
now
openly
proclaimed
the
doctrine
that
the
church
would
be
better
off
with
no
pope
at
all
he
owed
his
safety
to
the
bitterness
of
the
rival
popes
who
in
their
mutual
quarrels
had
no
time
to
think
of
him
and
his
opportunity
was
improved
by
writing
books
and
homilies
in
which
the
antichristian
claims
of
the
popes
were
fearlessly
exposed
and
commented
upon
in
fact
he
now
openly
denounces
the
pope
as
antichrist
from
his
pulpit
at
lutterworth
to
his
parishioners
for
whose
good
he
seems
to
have
earnestly
labored
the
model
of
a
parish
priest
it
is
supposed
that
chaucer
had
him
in
view
when
he
wrote
his
celebrated
description
of
a
good
parson
benign
and
diligent
learned
and
pious
giving
a
noble
example
to
his
flock
of
disinterestedness
and
devotion
to
truth
and
duty
in
contrast
with
the
ordinary
lives
of
the
clergy
of
those
times
who
were
infamous
for
their
ignorance
sensuality
gluttony
and
ostentation
frequenting
taverns
and
wasting
their
time
in
gambling
idleness
and
disgraceful
brawls
hitherto
wyclif
had
simply
protested
against
the
external
evils
of
the
church
without
much
effect
although
protected
by
powerful
laymen
and
encouraged
by
popular
favor
the
time
had
not
come
for
a
real
and
permanent
reformation
but
he
prepared
the
way
for
it
and
in
no
slight
degree
by
his
translation
of
the
scriptures
into
the
vernacular
tongue
the
greatest
service
he
rendered
to
the
english
people
and
the
cause
of
civilization
all
the
great
reformers
successful
and
unsuccessful
appealed
to
the
scriptures
as
the
highest
authority
even
when
they
did
not
rebel
against
the
papal
power
like
savonarola
in
florence
i
do
not
get
the
impression
that
wyclif
was
a
great
popular
preacher
like
the
florentine
reformer
or
like
luther
latimer
and
knox
he
was
a
student
first
of
the
scholastic
theology
and
afterwards
of
the
bible
he
lived
in
a
quiet
way
as
scholars
love
to
live
in
his
retired
rectory
near
oxford
preaching
plain
and
simple
sermons
to
his
parishioners
but
spending
his
time
chiefly
in
his
library
or
study
wyclif
translation
of
the
bible
was
a
great
event
for
it
was
the
first
which
was
made
in
english
although
parts
of
the
bible
had
been
translated
into
the
saxon
tongue
between
the
seventh
and
eleventh
centuries
he
had
no
predecessor
in
that
vast
work
and
he
labored
amid
innumerable
obstacles
it
was
not
a
translation
from
the
original
greek
and
hebrew
for
but
little
was
known
of
either
language
in
the
fourteenth
century
not
until
the
fall
of
constantinople
into
the
hands
of
the
turks
was
greek
or
hebrew
studied
so
the
translation
was
made
from
the
latin
vulgate
of
jerome
the
version
of
wyclif
besides
its
transcendent
value
to
the
people
now
able
to
read
the
bible
in
their
own
language
before
a
sealed
book
except
to
the
clergy
and
the
learned
gave
form
and
richness
to
the
english
language
to
what
extent
wyclif
was
indebted
to
the
labors
of
other
men
it
is
not
easy
to
determine
but
there
is
little
doubt
that
whatever
aid
he
received
the
whole
work
was
under
his
supervision
of
course
it
was
not
printed
for
printing
was
not
then
discovered
but
the
manuscripts
of
the
version
were
very
numerous
and
they
are
to
be
found
in
the
great
public
libraries
of
england
and
even
in
many
private
collections
considering
that
the
latin
vulgate
has
ever
been
held
in
supreme
veneration
by
the
catholic
church
in
all
ages
and
countries
by
popes
bishops
abbots
and
schoolmen
that
no
jealousy
existed
as
to
the
reading
of
it
by
the
clergy
generally
that
in
fact
it
was
not
a
sealed
book
to
the
learned
classes
and
was
regarded
universally
as
the
highest
authority
in
matters
of
faith
and
morals
it
seems
strange
that
so
violent
an
opposition
should
have
been
made
to
its
translation
into
vernacular
tongues
and
to
its
circulation
among
the
people
translation
was
regarded
as
an
act
of
sacrilege
worthy
of
condemnation
and
punishment
so
furious
was
the
outcry
against
him
as
an
audacious
violator
who
dared
to
touch
the
sacred
ark
with
unconsecrated
hands
that
even
a
bill
was
brought
into
the
house
of
lords
forbidding
the
perusal
of
the
bible
by
the
laity
and
it
would
have
been
passed
but
for
john
of
gaunt
at
a
convocation
of
bishops
and
clerical
dignitaries
held
in
paul
in
it
was
decreed
as
heresy
to
read
the
bible
in
english
to
be
punished
by
excommunication
the
version
of
wyclif
and
all
other
translations
into
english
were
utterly
prohibited
under
the
severest
penalties
fines
imprisonment
and
martyrdom
were
inflicted
on
those
who
were
guilty
of
so
foul
a
crime
as
the
reading
or
possession
of
the
scriptures
in
the
vernacular
tongue
this
is
one
of
the
gravest
charges
ever
made
against
the
catholic
church
this
absurd
and
cruel
persecution
alone
made
the
reformation
a
necessity
even
as
the
translation
of
the
bible
prepared
the
way
for
the
reformation
the
translation
of
the
scriptures
and
the
reformation
are
indissolubly
linked
together
nobody
doubts
that
the
whole
influence
of
the
catholic
hierarchy
has
ever
been
and
still
continues
to
be
hostile
to
the
perusal
of
the
scriptures
by
the
people
in
the
vulgar
tongue
and
it
was
this
translation
by
wyclif
which
made
him
more
obnoxious
to
the
pope
than
all
his
tirades
against
the
vices
of
the
monks
and
the
other
evils
which
disgraced
the
church
we
can
not
call
this
translation
a
reform
but
it
led
to
reforms
it
arrayed
the
people
against
the
usurpations
of
the
pope
and
the
corruptions
of
the
church
as
an
institution
yea
more
it
was
the
main
cause
of
that
memorable
religious
movement
which
followed
the
death
of
wyclif
there
would
have
been
no
lollards
had
there
been
no
translation
of
the
bible
it
led
also
to
the
affirmation
of
that
private
judgment
which
was
the
foundation
pillar
of
protestantism
and
which
existed
among
the
lollards
long
before
luther
delivered
his
message
and
yet
it
is
not
strange
that
the
catholic
hierarchy
i
say
catholic
rather
than
roman
because
in
the
fourteenth
century
there
was
but
one
church
although
in
that
church
considerable
difference
of
opinion
existed
both
as
to
matters
of
faith
and
government
should
have
bitterly
opposed
the
translation
of
the
scriptures
into
vernacular
tongues
since
it
opened
the
door
to
private
judgment
if
there
is
anything
the
catholic
church
has
hated
it
is
private
judgment
the
very
phrase
is
obnoxious
it
means
the
emancipation
of
the
people
from
papal
domination
and
ecclesiastical
bondage
of
all
description
while
the
thing
itself
is
subversive
of
all
the
claims
which
the
catholic
hierarchy
have
ever
put
forth
as
to
the
authority
of
the
church
as
an
institution
it
has
undermined
and
will
continue
to
undermine
spiritual
despotism
the
great
evil
of
the
middle
ages
and
of
the
papal
church
in
our
times
the
unrestrained
circulation
of
the
scriptures
in
the
language
the
people
can
understand
must
lead
to
the
breaking
up
of
the
false
doctrines
and
all
the
instruments
by
which
the
clergy
have
maintained
their
usurpations
it
necessarily
opens
the
eyes
of
the
people
to
the
antichristian
doctrine
of
penance
to
the
absurdity
of
indulgences
for
sin
to
the
unwarranted
worship
of
the
virgin
mary
to
the
monstrous
claim
of
papal
infallibility
and
to
all
other
glaring
usurpations
by
which
the
popes
have
ruled
the
world
there
is
not
a
false
doctrine
in
religion
nor
an
antichristian
form
of
worship
nor
a
usurped
prerogative
of
the
pope
and
clergy
which
the
unrestrained
perusal
of
the
scriptures
does
not
expose
illae
the
dignitaries
of
the
roman
catholic
church
are
not
fools
they
know
that
the
free
circulation
of
the
scriptures
in
vulgar
tongues
does
undermine
their
authority
and
will
ultimately
destroy
the
edifice
of
pride
and
pomp
and
power
which
it
took
a
thousand
years
to
build
this
is
what
they
ever
have
consistently
opposed
and
will
continue
to
oppose
as
a
thing
dangerous
to
them
they
would
have
destroyed
if
they
could
every
copy
of
the
version
which
wyclif
made
and
now
when
they
can
no
longer
prevent
the
bible
from
being
printed
they
would
exclude
it
from
the
schools
which
they
control
and
from
the
houses
of
those
who
belong
to
their
church
doubtless
the
opposition
to
the
circulation
of
the
bible
in
the
vernacular
has
been
exaggerated
but
in
the
fourteenth
century
it
was
certainly
bitter
and
furious
wyclif
might
expose
vices
which
everybody
saw
and
lamented
as
a
scandal
and
make
himself
obnoxious
to
those
who
committed
them
but
to
open
the
door
to
free
inquiry
and
a
reformed
faith
and
hostility
to
the
pope
this
was
a
graver
offence
to
be
visited
with
the
severest
penalties
to
the
storm
of
indignation
thus
raised
against
him
wyclif
only
answer
was
the
clergy
cry
aloud
that
it
is
heresy
to
speak
of
the
holy
scriptures
in
english
and
so
they
would
condemn
the
holy
ghost
who
gave
tongues
to
the
apostles
of
christ
to
speak
the
word
of
god
in
all
languages
under
heaven
notwithstanding
the
enormous
cost
of
the
bible
as
translated
by
wyclif
a
sum
probably
equal
to
thirty
pounds
or
one
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
of
our
present
money
more
than
half
the
annual
income
of
a
substantial
yeoman
still
it
was
copied
and
circulated
with
remarkable
rapidity
neither
the
cost
of
the
valuable
manuscript
nor
the
opposition
and
vigilance
of
an
almost
omnipresent
inquisition
were
able
to
suppress
it
wyclif
was
now
about
years
of
age
he
had
rendered
a
transcendent
service
to
the
english
nation
and
a
service
that
not
one
of
his
contemporaries
could
have
performed
to
which
only
the
foremost
scholar
and
theologian
of
his
day
was
equal
after
such
a
work
he
might
have
reposed
in
his
quiet
parish
in
genial
rest
conscious
that
he
had
opened
a
new
era
in
the
history
of
his
country
but
rest
was
not
for
him
he
now
appears
as
a
doctrinal
controversialist
hitherto
his
attacks
had
been
against
the
flagrant
external
evils
of
the
church
the
enormous
corruptions
that
had
entered
into
the
institutions
which
sustained
the
papal
power
he
had
been
the
advocate
of
the
university
in
defence
of
her
privileges
the
champion
of
the
crown
in
vindication
of
its
rights
and
prerogatives
the
friend
of
the
people
in
the
preservation
of
their
property
he
now
assailed
the
romish
doctrine
of
the
eucharist
but
without
the
support
of
those
powerful
princes
and
nobles
who
had
hitherto
sustained
him
he
combats
one
of
the
prevailing
ideas
of
the
age
a
more
difficult
and
infinitely
bolder
thing
which
theologians
had
not
dared
to
assail
and
which
in
was
a
to
luther
himself
in
ascending
the
mysterious
mount
where
clouds
gathered
around
him
his
old
friends
began
to
desert
him
for
now
he
assailed
the
awful
and
invisible
the
church
of
the
middle
ages
had
asserted
that
the
body
of
christ
was
actually
present
in
the
consecrated
wafer
and
few
there
were
who
doubted
it
berengar
had
maintained
in
the
eleventh
century
that
the
sacred
elements
should
be
regarded
as
mere
symbols
but
he
was
vehemently
opposed
with
all
the
terrors
of
spiritual
power
and
compelled
to
abjure
the
heresy
in
the
year
at
a
lateran
council
innocent
iii
established
the
doctrine
of
transubstantiation
as
one
of
the
fundamental
pillars
of
catholic
belief
then
metaphysics
all
the
weapons
of
scholasticism
were
called
into
the
service
of
superstition
to
establish
what
is
most
mythical
in
the
creed
of
the
church
and
which
implied
a
perpetual
miracle
since
at
the
moment
of
consecration
the
substance
of
the
bread
was
taken
away
and
the
substance
of
christ
body
took
its
place
from
his
chair
of
theology
at
oxford
in
wyclif
attacked
what
lanfranc
and
anselm
and
the
doctors
of
the
church
had
uniformly
and
strenuously
defended
his
views
of
the
eucharist
were
substantially
those
which
archbishop
berengar
had
advanced
three
hundred
years
before
and
of
course
drew
down
upon
him
the
censure
of
the
church
in
his
peril
he
appealed
not
to
the
pope
or
the
clergy
but
to
the
king
himself
a
measure
of
renewed
audacity
for
in
those
days
no
layman
however
exalted
had
authority
in
matters
purely
ecclesiastical
his
boldness
was
too
much
even
for
the
powerful
duke
of
lancaster
his
friend
and
patron
who
forbade
him
to
speak
further
on
such
a
matter
he
might
attack
the
mendicant
and
itinerant
friars
who
had
forgotten
their
duties
and
their
vows
but
not
the
great
mysteries
of
the
catholic
faith
when
he
questioned
the
priestly
power
of
absolution
and
the
pope
authority
in
purgatory
when
he
struck
at
indulgences
and
special
masses
he
had
on
his
side
the
spiritual
instincts
of
the
people
but
when
he
impugned
the
dignity
of
the
central
act
of
christian
worship
and
the
highest
expression
of
mystical
devotion
it
appeared
to
ordinary
minds
that
he
was
denying
all
that
is
sacred
impressive
and
authoritative
in
the
sacrament
itself
and
he
gave
offence
to
many
devout
minds
who
had
approved
his
attacks
on
the
monks
and
the
various
corruptions
of
the
church
even
the
parliament
pressed
the
archbishop
to
make
an
end
of
such
a
heresy
and
courtenay
who
hated
wyclif
needed
not
to
be
urged
so
a
council
was
assembled
at
the
dominican
convent
at
blackfriars
where
the
times
office
now
stands
and
unanimously
condemned
not
only
the
opinions
of
wyclif
as
to
the
eucharist
but
also
those
in
reference
to
the
power
of
excommunication
and
the
uselessness
of
the
religious
orders
yet
he
himself
was
allowed
to
escape
and
the
condemnation
had
no
other
effect
than
to
drive
him
from
oxford
to
his
rectory
at
lutterworth
where
until
his
death
he
occupied
himself
in
literary
and
controversial
writings
his
illness
soon
afterwards
prevented
him
from
obeying
the
summons
of
the
pope
to
rome
where
he
would
doubtless
have
suffered
as
a
martyr
in
he
was
struck
with
paralysis
and
died
in
three
days
after
the
attack
at
the
age
of
sixty
though
some
say
in
his
year
probably
in
spite
of
ecclesiastical
censure
the
most
revered
man
of
his
day
as
well
as
one
of
the
ablest
and
most
learned
not
from
the
ranks
of
fanatics
or
illiterate
popular
orators
did
the
reformation
come
in
any
country
but
from
the
greatest
scholars
and
theologians
this
grand
old
man
the
illustrious
pioneer
of
reform
in
england
and
indeed
on
the
continent
did
not
live
to
threescore
years
and
ten
but
being
worn
out
with
his
exhaustive
labors
he
died
peaceably
and
unmolested
in
his
retired
parish
not
much
is
known
of
the
details
of
his
personal
history
any
more
than
of
shakspeare
we
know
nothing
of
his
loves
and
hatreds
of
his
habits
and
tastes
of
his
temper
and
person
of
his
friends
and
enemies
he
stands
out
to
the
eye
of
posterity
in
solitary
and
mysterious
loneliness
tradition
speaks
of
him
as
a
successful
benignant
and
charitable
parish
priest
giving
consolation
to
the
afflicted
and
to
the
sick
he
lived
in
honor
professor
of
theology
at
oxford
holding
a
prebendal
stall
and
a
parochial
rectory
perhaps
a
seat
in
parliament
and
was
employed
by
the
crown
as
an
ambassador
to
bruges
he
was
statesman
as
well
as
theologian
and
lived
among
the
great
more
as
a
learned
doctor
than
as
a
saint
which
he
was
not
from
the
catholic
standpoint
he
was
the
scourge
of
imposture
the
ponderous
hammer
which
smote
the
brazen
idolatry
of
his
age
he
labored
to
expose
the
vices
that
had
taken
shelter
in
the
sanctuary
of
the
church
a
reformer
of
ecclesiastical
abuses
rather
than
of
the
lax
morals
of
the
laity
and
hence
did
different
work
from
that
of
savonarola
whose
life
was
spent
in
a
crusade
against
sin
wherever
it
was
to
be
found
his
labors
were
great
and
his
attainments
remarkable
for
his
age
he
is
accused
of
being
coarse
in
his
invectives
but
that
charge
can
also
be
laid
to
luther
and
other
reformers
in
rough
and
outspoken
times
considering
the
power
of
the
pope
in
the
fourteenth
century
wyclif
was
as
bold
and
courageous
as
luther
the
weakness
of
the
papacy
had
not
been
exposed
by
the
councils
of
pisa
of
constance
and
of
basil
nor
was
popular
indignation
in
view
of
the
sale
of
indulgences
as
great
in
england
as
when
the
dominican
tetzel
peddled
the
papal
pardons
in
germany
in
combating
the
received
ideas
of
the
age
wyclif
was
even
more
remarkable
than
the
saxon
reformer
who
was
never
fully
emancipated
from
the
mediaeval
doctrine
of
transubstantiation
although
luther
went
beyond
wyclif
in
the
completeness
of
his
reform
wyclif
was
beyond
his
age
luther
was
the
impersonation
of
its
passions
wyclif
represented
universities
and
learned
men
luther
was
the
oracle
of
the
people
the
former
was
the
mediaeval
doctor
the
latter
was
the
popular
orator
and
preacher
the
one
was
mild
and
moderate
in
his
spirit
and
manners
the
other
was
vehement
dogmatic
and
often
offensive
not
only
from
his
more
violent
and
passionate
nature
but
for
his
bitter
and
ironical
sallies
it
is
the
manner
more
than
the
matter
which
offends
had
wyclif
been
as
satirical
and
boisterous
as
luther
was
he
would
not
probably
have
ended
his
days
in
peace
and
would
not
have
accomplished
so
much
as
a
preparation
for
reforms
it
was
the
peculiarity
of
wyclif
to
recognize
occasional
merits
in
the
system
he
denounced
even
when
his
language
was
most
vehement
he
admitted
that
confession
did
much
good
to
some
persons
although
as
a
universal
practice
as
enjoined
by
innocent
it
was
an
evil
and
harmed
the
church
in
regard
to
the
worship
of
images
while
he
denounced
the
waste
of
treasure
on
dead
stocks
he
admitted
that
images
might
be
used
as
aids
to
excite
devotion
but
if
miraculous
powers
were
attributed
to
them
it
was
an
evil
rather
than
a
good
and
as
to
the
adoration
of
the
saints
he
simply
maintained
that
since
gifts
can
be
obtained
only
through
the
mediation
of
christ
it
would
be
better
to
pray
to
him
directly
rather
than
through
the
mediation
of
saints
in
regard
to
the
mendicant
friars
it
does
not
appear
that
his
vehement
opposition
to
them
was
based
on
their
vows
of
poverty
or
on
the
spirit
which
entered
into
monasticism
in
its
best
ages
but
because
they
were
untrue
to
their
rule
because
they
were
vendors
of
pardons
and
absolved
men
of
sins
which
they
were
ashamed
to
confess
to
their
own
pastors
and
especially
because
they
encouraged
the
belief
that
a
benefaction
to
a
convent
would
take
the
place
of
piety
in
the
heart
it
was
the
abuses
of
the
system
rather
than
the
system
itself
which
made
him
so
wrathful
on
the
vagrant
friars
preaching
their
catchpenny
sermons
and
so
of
other
abuses
of
the
church
he
did
not
defy
the
pope
or
deny
his
authority
until
it
was
plain
that
he
sought
to
usurp
the
prerogatives
of
kings
and
secular
rulers
and
bring
both
the
clergy
and
laity
under
his
spiritual
yoke
it
was
not
as
the
first
and
chief
of
bishops
the
head
of
the
visible
church
that
wyclif
attacked
the
pope
but
as
a
usurper
and
a
tyrant
grasping
powers
which
were
not
conferred
by
the
early
church
and
which
did
not
culminate
until
innocent
iii
had
instituted
the
mendicant
orders
and
enforced
persecution
for
religious
opinions
by
the
terrors
of
the
inquisition
the
wealth
of
the
church
was
a
sore
evil
in
his
eyes
since
it
diverted
the
clergy
from
their
spiritual
duties
and
was
the
cause
of
innumerable
scandals
and
was
closely
connected
with
simony
and
the
accumulation
of
benefices
in
the
hands
of
a
single
priest
so
it
was
indignation
in
view
of
the
corruptions
of
the
church
and
vehement
attacks
upon
them
which
characterized
wyclif
rather
than
efforts
to
remove
their
causes
as
was
the
case
with
luther
he
was
not
a
radical
reformer
he
only
prepared
the
way
for
radical
reform
by
his
translation
of
the
scriptures
into
a
language
the
people
could
read
more
than
by
any
attacks
on
the
monks
or
papal
usurpations
or
indulgences
for
sin
he
was
the
type
of
a
meditative
scholar
and
theologian
thin
and
worn
without
much
charm
of
conversation
except
to
men
of
rank
or
great
animal
vivacity
such
as
delights
the
people
nor
was
he
a
religious
genius
like
thomas
√†
kempis
anselm
and
pascal
he
had
no
remarkable
insight
into
spiritual
things
his
intellectual
and
moral
nature
preponderated
over
the
emotional
so
that
he
was
charged
with
intellectual
pride
and
desire
for
distinction
yet
no
one
disputed
the
blamelessness
of
his
life
and
the
elevation
of
his
character
if
wyclif
escaped
the
wrath
and
vengeance
of
rome
because
of
his
high
rank
as
a
theological
doctor
his
connection
with
the
university
of
oxford
opposed
to
itinerating
beggars
with
great
pretensions
and
greedy
ends
and
his
friendship
and
intercourse
with
the
rulers
of
the
land
his
followers
did
not
they
became
very
numerous
and
were
variously
called
lollards
wyclifites
and
biblemen
they
kept
alive
evangelical
religion
until
the
time
of
cranmer
and
latimer
their
distinguishing
doctrine
being
that
the
scriptures
are
the
only
rule
of
faith
there
was
no
persecution
of
them
of
any
account
during
the
reign
of
richard
although
he
was
a
hateful
tyrant
probably
owing
to
the
influence
of
his
wife
a
bohemian
princess
who
read
wyclif
bible
but
under
henry
iv
evil
days
fell
upon
them
and
persecution
was
intensified
under
henry
because
of
their
supposed
rebellion
the
lollards
under
archbishop
chicheley
as
early
as
were
hunted
down
and
burned
as
heretics
the
severest
inquisition
was
instituted
to
hunt
up
those
who
were
even
suspected
of
heresy
and
every
parish
was
the
scene
of
cruelties
i
need
not
here
enumerate
the
victims
of
persecution
continued
with
remorseless
severity
during
the
whole
reign
of
henry
vii
but
it
was
impossible
to
suppress
the
opinions
of
the
reformers
or
to
prevent
the
circulation
of
the
scriptures
the
blood
of
martyrs
was
the
seed
of
the
church
persecution
in
this
instance
was
not
successful
since
there
was
a
noble
material
in
england
as
in
germany
for
christianity
to
work
upon
it
was
in
humble
homes
among
the
yeomanry
and
the
artisans
that
evangelical
truth
took
the
deepest
hold
as
in
primitive
times
and
produced
the
fervent
christians
of
succeeding
centuries
such
as
no
other
country
has
produced
in
no
country
was
the
reformation
as
established
by
edward
vi
and
elizabeth
so
complete
and
so
permanent
unless
scotland
and
switzerland
be
excepted
the
glory
of
this
radical
reform
must
be
ascribed
to
the
humble
and
persecuted
followers
of
wyclif
who
proved
themselves
martyrs
and
witnesses
faithful
unto
death
