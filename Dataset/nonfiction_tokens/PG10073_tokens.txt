owes
more
than

dedication
can
acknowledge
preface
you
should
know
at
the
outset
what
this
book
does
attempt
to
do
it
does
not
save
to
the
extent
that
its
own
special
purpose
requires
concern
itself
with
the
many
and
intricate
problems
of
grammar
rhetoric
spelling
punctuation
and
the
like
or
clarify
the
thousands
of
individual
difficulties
regarding
correct
usage
all
these
matters
are
important
concise
treatment
of
them
may
be
found
in
the
century
handbook
of
writing
and
the
century
desk
book
of
good
english
both
of
which
manuals
are
issued
by
the
present
publishers
but
this
volume
confines
itself
to
the
one
task
of
placing
at
your
disposal
the
means
of
adding
to
your
stock
of
words
of
increasing
your
vocabulary
it
does
not
assume
that
you
are
a
scholar
or
try
to
make
you
one
to
be
sure
it
recognizes
the
ends
of
scholarship
as
worthy
it
levies
at
every
turn
upon
the
facts
which
scholarship
has
accumulated
but
it
demands
of
you
no
technical
equipment
nor
leads
you
into
any
of
those
bypaths
of
knowledge
alluring
indeed
of
which
the
benefits
are
not
immediate
for
example
in
chapter
v
it
forms
into
groups
words
etymologically
akin
to
each
other
it
does
this
for
an
end
entirely
practical
namely
that
the
words
you
know
may
help
you
to
understand
the
words
you
do
not
know
did
it
go
farther
did
it
account
for
minor
differences
in
these
words
by
showing
that
they
sprang
from
related
rather
than
identical
originals
did
it
explain
how
and
how
variously
their
forms
have
been
modified
in
the
long
process
of
their
descent
it
would
pass
beyond
its
strict
utilitarian
bounds
this
it
refrains
from
doing
and
thus
everything
it
contains
it
rigorously
subjects
to
the
test
of
serviceability
it
helps
you
to
bring
more
and
more
words
into
workaday
harness
to
gain
such
mastery
over
them
that
you
can
speak
and
write
them
with
fluency
flexibility
precision
and
power
it
enables
you
in
your
use
of
words
to
attain
the
readiness
and
efficiency
expected
of
a
capable
and
cultivated
man
there
are
many
ways
of
building
a
vocabulary
as
there
are
many
ways
of
attaining
and
preserving
health
fanatics
may
insist
that
one
should
be
cultivated
to
the
exclusion
of
the
others
just
as
may
declare
that
diet
should
be
watched
in
complete
disregard
of
recreation
sanitation
exercise
the
need
for
medicines
and
one
mental
attitude
to
life
but
the
sum
of
human
experience
rather
than
fanaticism
must
determine
our
procedure
moreover
experience
has
shown
that
the
various
successful
methods
of
bringing
words
under
man
sway
are
not
mutually
antagonistic
but
may
be
practiced
simultaneously
just
as
health
is
promoted
not
by
attending
to
diet
one
year
to
exercise
the
next
and
to
mental
attitude
the
third
but
by
bestowing
wise
and
fairly
constant
attention
on
all
yet
it
would
be
absurd
to
state
that
all
methods
of
increasing
one
vocabulary
or
of
attaining
vigor
of
physique
are
equally
valuable
this
volume
offers
everything
that
helps
and
it
yields
space
in
proportion
to
helpfulness
aside
from
a
brief
introductory
chapter
a
chapter
number
x
given
over
to
a
list
of
words
and
a
brief
concluding
chapter
the
subject
matter
of
the
volume
falls
into
three
main
divisions
chapters
ii
and
iii
are
based
on
the
fact
that
we
must
all
use
words
in
combination
must
fling
the
words
out
by
the
handfuls
even
as
the
accomplished
pianist
must
strike
his
notes
chapters
iv
and
v
are
based
on
the
fact
that
we
must
become
thoroughly
acquainted
with
individual
words
that
no
one
who
scorns
to
study
the
separate
elements
of
speech
can
command
powerful
and
discriminating
utterance
chapters
vi
vii
viii
and
ix
are
based
on
the
fact
that
we
need
synonyms
as
our
constant
lackeys
that
we
should
be
able
to
summon
not
a
word
that
will
do
but
a
word
that
will
express
the
idea
with
precision
exercises
scattered
throughout
the
book
together
with
five
of
the
six
appendices
provide
inexhaustible
materials
for
practice
for
be
it
understood
once
for
all
that
this
volume
is
not
a
machine
which
you
can
set
going
and
then
sit
idly
beside
the
while
your
vocabulary
broadens
mastery
over
words
like
worthy
mastery
of
any
kind
whatsoever
involves
effort
for
yourself
you
can
of
course
contemplate
the
nature
and
activities
of
the
mechanism
and
learn
something
thereby
but
also
you
must
work
work
hard
work
intelligently
as
you
can
not
acquire
health
by
watching
a
gymnast
take
exercise
or
a
doctor
swallow
medicine
or
a
dietician
select
food
so
you
can
not
become
an
overlord
of
words
without
first
fighting
battles
to
subjugate
them
hence
this
volume
is
for
you
less
a
machine
than
a
collection
and
arrangement
of
materials
which
you
must
put
together
by
hand
it
assembles
everything
you
need
it
tags
everything
plainly
it
tells
you
just
what
you
must
do
in
these
ways
it
makes
your
task
far
easier
the
task
is
industry
persistence
a
fair
amount
of
common
sense
these
three
you
must
have
without
them
you
will
accomplish
nothing
even
with
them
let
the
forewarning
be
candid
you
will
not
accomplish
everything
you
can
not
learn
all
there
is
to
be
learned
about
words
any
more
than
about
human
nature
and
what
you
do
achieve
will
be
not
a
sudden
attainment
but
a
growth
this
is
not
the
dark
side
of
the
picture
it
is
an
honest
avowal
that
the
picture
is
not
composed
altogether
of
light
but
as
the
result
of
your
efforts
an
adequate
vocabulary
will
some
day
be
yours
nor
will
you
have
to
wait
long
for
an
earnest
of
ultimate
success
just
as
system
will
speedily
transform
a
haphazard
business
into
one
which
seizes
opportunities
and
stops
the
leakage
of
profits

i
reasons
for
increasing
your
vocabulary
sometimes
a
dexterous
use
of
words
appears
to
us
to
be
only
a
kind
of
parlor
trick
and
sometimes
it
just
that
the
command
of
a
wide
vocabulary
is
in
truth
an
accomplishment
and
like
any
other
accomplishment
it
may
be
used
for
show
but
not
necessarily
just
as
a
man
may
have
money
without
flashing
it
or
an
extensive
wardrobe
without
sporting
gaudy
neckties
or
wearing
a
dress
suit
in
the
morning
so
may
he
possess
linguistic
resources
without
making
a
caddish
exhibition
of
them
indeed
the
more
distant
he
stands
from
verbal
bankruptcy
the
less
likely
he
is
to
indulge
in
needless
display
again
glibness
of
speech
sometimes
awakens
our
distrust
we
like
actions
rather
than
words
we
prefer
that
character
personality
and
kindly
feelings
should
be
their
own
mouthpiece
so
be
it
but
there
are
thoughts
and
emotions
properly
to
be
shared
with
other
people
yet
incapable
of
being
revealed
except
through
language
it
is
only
when
language
is
insincere
when
it
expresses
lofty
sentiments
or
generous
sympathies
yet
springs
from
designing
selfishness
that
it
justly
arouses
misgivings
power
over
words
like
power
of
any
other
sort
is
for
use
not
abuse
that
it
sometimes
is
abused
must
not
mislead
us
into
thinking
that
it
should
in
itself
be
scorned
or
neglected
our
contempt
and
distrust
do
not
mean
that
our
fundamental
ideas
about
language
are
unsound
beneath
our
wholesome
dislike
for
shallow
facility
and
insincerity
of
speech
we
have
a
conviction
that
the
mastery
of
words
is
a
good
thing
not
a
bad
we
are
therefore
unwilling
to
take
the
vow
of
linguistic
poverty
if
we
lack
the
ability
to
bend
words
to
our
use
it
is
from
laziness
not
from
scruple
we
desire
to
speak
competently
but
without
affectation
we
know
that
if
our
diction
rises
to
this
dual
standard
it
silently
distinguishes
us
from
the
sluggard
the
weakling
and
the
upstart
for
such
diction
is
not
to
be
had
on
sudden
notice
like
a
suit
nor
can
it
like
such
a
suit
deceive
anybody
as
to
our
true
status
a
man
utterance
reveals
what
he
is
it
is
the
measure
of
his
inward
attainment
the
assertion
has
been
made
that
for
a
man
to
express
himself
freely
and
well
in
his
native
language
is
the
surest
proof
of
his
culture
meditate
the
saying
can
you
think
of
a
proof
that
is
surer
but
a
man
speech
does
more
than
lend
him
distinction
it
does
more
than
reveal
to
others
what
manner
of
man
he
is
it
is
an
instrument
as
well
as
an
index
it
is
an
agent
oftentimes
indeed
it
is
agent
of
his
influence
upon
others
how
silly
are
those
persons
who
oppose
words
to
things
as
if
words
were
not
things
at
all
but
unrealities
words
are
among
the
most
powerful
realities
in
the
world
you
vote
the
republican
ticket
why
because
you
have
studied
the
issues
of
the
campaign
and
reached
a
conclusion
how
the
general
interests
may
be
served
possibly
but
nine
times
in
ten
it
will
be
because
of
that
republican
you
may
believe
that
in
a
given
instance
the
republican
cause
or
candidate
is
inferior
you
may
have
nothing
personally
to
lose
through
republican
defeat
yet
you
squirm
and
twist
and
seek
excuses
for
casting
a
republican
ballot
such
is
the
power
aye
sometimes
the
tyranny
of
a
word
the
word
has
not
been
selected
invidiously
would
have
served
as
well
or
take
religious
words
methodist
presbyterian
episcopalian
baptist
lutheran
or
what
not
a
man
who
belongs
in
person
or
by
proxy
to
one
of
the
sects
designated
may
be
more
indifferent
to
the
institution
itself
than
to
the
word
that
represents
it
thus
you
may
attack
in
his
presence
the
tenets
of
presbyterianism
for
example
but
you
must
be
wary
about
calling
the
presbyterian
name
the
what
sooner
than
an
insult
coupled
with
these
terms
will
rouse
a
man
to
fight
but
does
that
man
kiss
his
mother
or
salute
the
flag
or
pay
much
heed
to
either
probably
not
words
not
realities
with
what
realities
must
we
more
carefully
reckon
words
are
as
dangerous
as
dynamite
as
beneficent
as
brotherhood
an
unfortunate
word
may
mean
a
plea
rejected
an
enterprise
baffled
half
the
world
plunged
into
war
a
fortunate
word
may
open
a
door
avert
a
disaster
bring
thousands
of
people
from
jealousy
and
hatred
into
coöperation
and
goodwill
nor
is
it
solely
on
their
emotional
side
that
men
may
be
affected
by
words
their
thinking
and
their
esthetic
nature
also
their
hard
sense
and
their
personal
likes
and
dislikes
are
subject
to
the
same
influence
you
interview
a
potential
investor
does
he
accept
your
proposition
or
not
a
prospective
customer
walks
into
your
store
does
he
buy
the
goods
you
show
him
you
enter
the
drawing
room
of
one
of
the
elite
are
you
invited
again
and
again
your
words
will
largely
decide
your
words
or
your
verbal
abstinence
for
be
it
remembered
that
words
no
more
than
dollars
are
to
be
scattered
broadcast
for
the
sole
reason
that
you
have
them
the
right
word
should
be
used
at
the
right
time
and
at
that
time
only
silence
is
oftentimes
golden
nevertheless
there
are
occasions
for
us
to
speak
frequent
occasions
to
be
inarticulate
may
mean
only
embarrassment
it
may
some
day
it
will
mean
suffering
and
failure
that
we
may
make
the
most
of
the
important
occasions
sure
to
come
we
must
have
our
instruments
ready
those
instruments
are
words
he
who
commands
words
commands
events
commands
men
ii
words
in
combination
some
pitfalls
you
wish
then
to
increase
your
vocabulary
of
course
you
must
become
observant
of
words
and
inquisitive
about
them
for
words
are
like
people
they
have
their
own
particular
characteristics
they
do
their
work
well
or
ill
they
are
in
good
odor
or
bad
and
they
yield
best
service
to
him
who
loves
them
and
tries
to
understand
them
your
curiosity
about
them
must
be
burning
and
insatiable
you
must
study
them
when
they
have
withdrawn
from
the
throng
of
their
fellows
into
the
quiescence
of
their
natural
selves
you
must
also
see
them
and
study
them
in
action
not
only
as
they
are
employed
in
good
books
and
by
careful
speakers
but
likewise
as
they
fall
from
the
lips
of
unconventional
speakers
who
through
them
secure
vivid
and
telling
effects
in
brief
you
must
learn
word
nature
as
you
learn
human
nature
from
a
variety
of
sources
now
in
ordinary
speech
most
of
us
use
words
not
as
individual
things
but
as
parts
of
a
whole
as
cogs
in
the
machine
of
utterance
by
which
we
convey
our
thoughts
and
feelings
we
do
not
think
of
them
separately
at
all
and
this
instinct
is
sound
in
our
expression
we
are
like
manufacturing
plants
rather
than
establishments
we
have
at
our
disposal
not
one
worker
but
a
multitude
hence
we
are
concerned
with
our
employees
collectively
and
with
the
total
production
of
which
they
are
capable
to
be
sure
our
understanding
of
them
as
individuals
will
increase
the
worth
and
magnitude
of
our
output
but
clearly
we
must
have
large
dealings
with
them
in
the
aggregate
this
chapter
and
the
following
therefore
are
given
over
to
the
study
of
words
in
combination
as
in
all
matters
there
is
a
negative
as
well
as
a
positive
side
to
be
reckoned
with
let
us
consider
the
negative
side
first
tameness
correct
diction
is
too
often
insipid
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
it
but
it
does
not
interest
us
it
lacks
character
lacks
color
lacks
power
it
too
closely
resembles
what
we
conceive
of
the
angels
as
having
impeccability
without
the
warmth
of
camaraderie
speech
like
a
man
should
be
alive
it
need
not
of
course
be
boisterous
it
may
be
intense
in
a
quiet
modest
way
but
if
it

a

it

indeed
the

to
instil

into

rarer

an
inoffensive
one

the

of

is

with
failures

such

are
beyond
the

of
those

who
are
constantly
pausing

grope

the
end
for
which
we
gain
our
understanding
must
be
to
hurl
these

upon
the
enemy

as
disconnected

another
thing

another
thing
to
avoid
is
triteness
the
english
language

with
phrases
once
strikingly
original
but
now
and
vulgarized
by
incessant
repetition
it
can
scarcely
be
said
that
you
are
to
shun
these
altogether
now
and
then
you
will
find
one
of
them
coming

but
you
must
not
use
them
too
often

you
must

finally
to
the
extent
that
you

slang
at
all
be
its
master
instead
of
its
slave
you
have
many
times
been
told
that
the
overuse
of
slang
disfigures
one
speech
and
hampers
his
standing
with
cultivated
people
you
have
also
been
told
that
slang
constantly
changes
so
that
accumulations
of
it
today
will
be
a
profitless
clutter
tomorrow
these
things
are
true
but
an
even
more
cogent
objection
remains
slang
is
detrimental
to
the
formation
of
good
intellectual
habits
from
its
very
nature
it
can
not
be
precise
can
not
discriminate
closely
it
is
a
vehicle
for
people
it
is
fraught
with
unconsidered
general
meanings
it
moves
in
a
region
of
mental
mists
it
could
not
flourish
as
it
does
were
fewer
of
us
content
to
express
vague
thoughts
and
feelings
instead
of
those
which
are
sharply
and
specifically
ours
unless
therefore
you
wish
your
intellectual
processes
to
be
as
hazy
and
haphazard
as
those
of
mental
shirkers
and
loafers
you
must
eschew
not
necessarily
all
slang
but
all
heedless
all
habitual
use
of
it
now
and
then
a
touch
of
slang
judiciously
chosen
is
effective
now
and
then
it
fulfils
a
legitimate
purpose
of
language
but
normally
you
should
express
yourself
as
befits
one
who
has
at
his
disposal
the
rich
treasuries
of
the
dictionary
instead
of
a
mere
stock
of
greasy
counterfeit

accuracy
but
to
display
spontaneity
daring
freshness
accuracy
you
must
have
or
acquire
a
large
stock
a
wide
range
of
words
now
this
possession
like
any
other
brings
with
it
temptation
if
we
have
words
we
like
to
use
them
nor
do
we
wait
for
an
indulgence
in
this
luxury
until
we
have
consciously
set
to
work
to
amass
a
vocabulary
verbosity
is
in
truth
the
besetting
linguistic
sin
most
people
are
lavish
with
words
as
most
people
are
lavish
with
money
this
is
not
to
say
that
in
the
currency
of
language
they
are
rich
but
even
if
they
lack
the
means
and
the
desire
to
be
extravagant
they
yet
make
their
purchases
heedlessly
or
fail
to
count
their
linguistic
change
the
degree
of

ostentatious
terms

son
these
convey
their
thought
and
feeling
perfectly
yet
both
are
simple
exquisitely
simple
they
strike
us
indeed
as
being
inevitable
as
if
their

could
not
have
been

than
it
is
they
have
they
are

of
our
meaning
instead
of
expressing
it
briefly
and
clearly
we
throw
a
handful
of
words
at
an
idea
when
one
word
would
suffice
we
try
to
bring
the
idea
down
with
a
shotgun
instead
of
a
rifle
of
course
one
means
of
correction
is
that
we
should
acquire
accuracy
a
quality
already
discussed
another
is
that
we
should
practice
condensation
first
let
us
learn
to
omit
the
words
which
add
nothing
to
the
meaning
thus
in
the
sentence
an
important
essential
in
cashing
a
check
is
that
you
should
indorse
it
on
the
back
several
words
or
groups
of
words
needlessly
repeat
ideas
which
are
expressed
elsewhere
the
sentence
is
as
complete
in
substance
and
far
terser
in
form
when
it
reads
an
essential
in
cashing
a
check
is
that
you
should
indorse
it
next
let
us
when
we
may
reduce
phrases
and
even
clauses
to
a
word
thus
the
clause
at
the
beginning
and
the
phrase
at
the
close
of
the
following
sentence
constitute
sheer
verbiage
men
who
have
let
their
temper
get
the
better
of
them
are
often
in
a
mood
to
do
harm
to
somebody
the
sentence
tells
us
nothing
that
may
not
be
told
in
five
words
angry
men
are
often
dangerous
finally
let
us
substitute
phrases
or
clauses
for
unnecessary
sentences
the
following
series
of
independent
assertions
contains
avoidable
repetitions
one
morning
i
was

the
full

may
better
be

you
will
often
be
able
to
strike
out
many
of
the
words
without
at
all
impairing
the
meaning
another
means
of
acquiring
succinct
expression
is
to
practice
the
composition
of
telegrams

messages
you
will
of
course
lessen
the
cost
by
eliminating
every
word
that
can
possibly
be
spared
on
the
other
hand
you
must
bear
it
in
mind
that
your
punctuation
will
not
be
transmitted
and
that
the
recipient
must
be
absolutely
safeguarded
against
reading
together
words
meant
to
be
separated

as
we

it
sounded
terrible

for

while

it
is
to

over
details
not
vital
to
your
purpose
of

you
must
have
due
regard
for
circumstances
details
needed
for
one
purpose
may
be
superfluous
for
another
but
all
of
us
are
familiar
with
the
person
who
loses
her
ideas
in
a
rigmarole
of
prosaic
and
irrelevant
facts
such
a
person
is
shakespeare

on

this

is
shrilly
reproaching
sir
john

for
his

inquires
she

thou
wert
an
honest
man
thyself
and
the
money
too
thou
didst
promise
to
marry
me
deny
it
if
thou
canst
instead
she
plunges
into
a
prolix
recital
of
the
circumstances
of
the
engagement
so
that
the
fact
that
the
engagement
exists
has
no
special
emphasis
in
her
welter
of
words
if
thou
wert
an
honest
man
she
cries
thyself
and
the
money
too
thou
didst

to
me
upon

at

study
the
following
paragraph
decide
which
ideas
are
important
and
strike
out
the
details
that
merely
clog
the
thought
as
i
stepped
into
the
room
i
heard
the
clock
ticking
and
that
caused
me
to
look
at
it
it
sits
on
the
mantelpiece
with
some
layers
of
paper
under
one
corner
where
the
mantel
is
warped
when
the
papers
slip
out
or
we
move
the
clock
a
little
as
we
dusting
the
ticking
stops
right
away
of
course
the
clock
not
a
new
one
at
all
but
it
an
old
one
it
has
been
in
the
family
for
many
a
long
year
yes
from
even
before
my
time
let
me
see
it
was
bought
by
my
grandfather
no
it
could
have
been
grandfather
that
bought
it
it
was
his
brother
oh
yes
i
remember
now
my
mother
told
me
all
about
it
and
i
forgotten
what
she
said
till
this
minute
but
really
my
grandfather
brother
did
exactly
buy
it
he
just
traded
for
it
he
gave
two
pigs
and
a
saddle
that
what
my
mother
said
you
see
he
was
afraid
his
hogs
might
take
cholera
and
so
he
wanted
to
get
rid
of
them
and
as
for
the
saddle
he
had
sold
his
and
he
did
have
any
more
use
for
that
well
it
is
a
valuable
clock
like
a
grandfather
clock
or
anything
of
that
sort
though
it
is
antique
as
i
was
saying
when
i
glanced
at
it
it
read
seven
minutes
to
six
i
remember
the
time
very
well
for
just
then
the
factory
whistle
blew
and
i
remember
saying
to
myself
it
seven
minutes
slow
today
you
see
old
and
we
do
keep
it
oiled
and
so
it
always
losing
time
hardly
a
day
passes
but
i
set
it
up
sometimes
twice
a
day
as
for
the
matter
of
that
and
i
usually
go
by
the
factory
whistle
too
though
now
and
then
i
go
by
dwight
gold
watch
well
anyhow
that
tells
me
what
time
it
was
i
certain
i
ca
be
wrong
study
on
the
other
hand
the
castaway
appendix
for
its
judicious
use
of
details
defoe
in
his
stories
is
a
supreme
master
of
verisimilitude
likeness
to
truth
as
we
read
him
we
can
not
help
believing
that
these
things
actually
happened
more
than
in
anything
else
the
secret
of
his
lifelikeness
lies
in
his
constant
faithfulness
to
reality
he
puts
in
the
little
mishaps
that
would
have
befallen
a
man
so
situated
the
things
he
would
have
done
the
difficulties
he
might
have
avoided
had
he
exercised
forethought
though
defoe
had
little
insight
into
the
complexities
of
man
inner
life
he
has
not
been
surpassed
in
his
accumulations
of
naturalistic
outer
details
these
do
not
cumber
his
narrative
they
contribute
to
its
purpose
and
add
to
its
effectiveness
in
this
selection
appendix
observe
how
plausible
are
such
homely
details
as
seeing
no
sign
of
his
comrades
except
three
of
their
hats
one
cap
and
two
shoes
that
were
not
fellows
as
his
difficulty
in
getting
aboard
the
ship
again
and
as
his
having
his
clothes
washed
away
by
the
rising
of
the
tide
find
half
a
dozen
other
such
incidents
that
you
consider
especially
effective
verbal
discords
we
may
pitch
our
talk
or
our
writing
in
almost
any
key
we
choose
our
mood
may
be
dreamy
or
eager
or
hilarious
or
grim
or
blustering
or
somber
or
bantering
or
scornful
or
satirical
or
whatever
we
will
but
once
we
have
established
the
tone
we
should
not
except
sometimes
for
broadly
humorous
effects
change
it
needlessly
or
without
clear
forewarning
if
we
do
we
create
one
or
the
other
of
two
obstacles
or
both
of
them
for
whoever
is
trying
to
follow
what
we
say
in
the
first
place
we
obscure
our
meaning
for
example
we
have
been
speaking
ironically
and
suddenly
swerve
into
serious
utterance
or
we
have
been
speaking
seriously
and
then
incongruously
adopt
an
ironic
tone
how
are
our
listeners
our
readers
to
take
us
they
are
puzzled
they
do
not
know
in
the
second
place
we
offend
perhaps
in
insidious
indefinable
fashion
the
esthetic
proprieties
we
violate
the
natural
fitness
of
things
for
example
we
have
been
speaking
with
colloquial
freedom
sprinkling
our
discourse
with
and
suddenly
we
become
formal
and
say
and
our
meaning
is
as
obvious
as
before
but
the
verbal
harmony
has
been
interrupted
our
hearers
or
readers
are
uneasily
aware
of
a
break
in
the
unity
of
tone
a
speaker
or
writer
is
a
host
to
verbal
guests
when
he
invites
them
to
his
assembly
he
gives
each
the
tacit
assurance
that
it
will
not
be
brought
into
fellowship
with
those
which
in
one
or
another
of
a
dozen
subtle
ways
will
be
uncongenial
company
for
it
he
must
never
be
forgetful
of
this
unspoken
promise
if
he
is
to
avoid
a
linguistic
breach
he
must
constantly
have
his
wits
about
him
must
study
out
his
combinations
carefully
and
use
all
his
knowledge
all
his
tact
he
will
make
due
use
of
spontaneous
impulse
but
that
this
may
be
wise
and
disciplined
he
will
form
the
habit
of
curiosity
about
words
their
stations
their
savor
their
aptitudes
their
limitations
their
outspokenness
their
reticences
their
affinities
and
antipathies
thus
when
he
has
need
of
a
phrase
to
fill
out
a
verbal
dinner
party
he
will
know
which
one
to
select
certain
broad
classifications
of
words
are
manifest
even
to
the
most
obtuse
user
of
english
and
are
popular
words
while
their
synonyms
decapitate
and
are
learned
words
and
are
colloquial
while
and
are
literary
and
are
technical
while
and
are
slang
it
would
be
disenchanting
indeed
were
extremes
of
this
sort
brought
together
but
offenses
of
a
less
glaring
kind
are
as
hard
to
shut
out
as
february
cold
from
a
heated
house
unusual
are
the
speeches
or
compositions
even
the
short
ones
in
which
every
word
is
in
keeping
is
in
perfect
tune
with
the
rest
for
the
attainment
of
this
ultimate
verbal
decorum
we
should
have
to
possess
knowledge
almost
unbounded
together
with
unerring
artistic
instinct
but
diction
of
a
kind
only
measurably
inferior
to
this
is
possible
to
us
if
we
are
in
earnest
to
attain
it
we
must
study
the
difference
between
abstract
and
concrete
terms
and
let
neither
intrude
unadvisedly
upon
the
presence
or
functions
of
the
other
do
the
same
by
literal
and
figurative
terms
and
instruct
ourselves
in
the
nature
and
significance
of
connotation
before
considering
these
more
detailed
matters
however
we
may
pause
for
a
general
exercise

harmony

abstract
vs
concrete
terms

vs
specific
terms
abstract
terms
convey
ideas
concrete
terms
call
up
pictures
if
we
say
honesty
is
the
best
policy
we
speak
abstractly
nobody
can
see
or
hear
or
touch
the
thing
or
the
thing
the
apprehension
of
them
must
be
purely
intellectual
but
if
we
say
the
rat
began
to
gnaw
the
rope
we
speak
concretely
and
are
tangible
perceptible
things
the
words
bring
to
us
visions
of
particular
objects
and
actions
now
when
we
engage
in
explanations
and
discussions
of
principles
theories
broad
social
topics
and
the
like
when
we
expound
moralize
or
philosophize
our
subject
matter
is
general
we
approach
our
readers
or
hearers
on
the
thinking
the
rational
side
of
their
natures
our
phraseology
is
therefore
normally
abstract
but
when
on
the
other
hand
we
narrate
an
event
or
depict
an
appearance
our
subject
matter
is
specific
we
approach
our
readers
or
hearers
on
the
sensory
or
emotional
side
of
their
natures
our
phraseology
is
therefore
normally
concrete
you
should
be
able
to
express
yourself
according
to
either
method
you
should
be
able
to
choose
the
words
best
suited
to
make
people
understand
also
to
choose
the
words
best
suited
to
make
people
realize
vividly
and
feel
now
to
some
extent
you
will
adopt
the
right
method
by
intuition
but
if
you
do
not
reinforce
your
intuition
with
a
careful
study
of
words
you
will
vacillate
from
one
method
to
the
other
and
strike
crude
discords
of
phrasing
of
course
if
you
switch
methods
intelligently
and
of
purpose
that
is
quite
another
matter
an
abstract
discussion
may
be
enlivened
by
a
concrete
illustration
a
concrete
narrative
or
portrayal
may
be
given
weight
and
rationalized
by
generalization
moreover
many
things
lie
on
the
borderland
between
the
two
domains
and
may
properly
be
attached
to
either
thus
the
abstraction
is
legitimate
when
you
say
or
write
a
man
wishes
to
acquire
the
comforts
and
luxuries
as
well
as
the
necessaries
of
life
the
concreteness
is
likewise
legitimate
when
you
say
or
write
john
smith
wishes
to
earn
cake
as
well
as
bread
and
butter
in
most
instances
general
terms
are
the
same
as
abstract
and
specific
the
same
as
concrete
some
subtle
discriminations
may
however
be
made
of
these
the
only
one
that
need
concern
us
here
is
that
the
wording
of
a
passage
may
not
be
abstract
and
yet
be
general
suppose
for
example
you
were
telling
the
story
of
the
prodigal
son
and
should
say
he
was
very
hungry
and
could
not
obtain
food
anywhere
when
he
had
come
to
his
senses
he
thought
should
be
better
off
at
home
this
language
is
not
abstract
but
it
is
general
rather
than
specific
when
jesus
told
the
story
he
wished
to
put
the
situation
as
poignantly
as
possible
and
therefore
avoided
both
abstract
and
general
terms
and
he
would
fain
have
filled
his
belly
with
the
husks
that
the
swine
did
eat
and
no
man
gave
unto
him
and
when
he
came
to
himself
he
said
how
many
hired
servants
of
my
father
have
bread
enough
and
to
spare
and
i
perish
with
hunger
many
a
person
who
shuns
abstractions
and
talks
altogether
of
the
concrete
things
of
life
yet
traps
out
circumstance
in
general
rather
than
specific
terms
to
do
this
is
always
to
sacrifice
force
exercise
abstract
discuss
as
abstractly
as
possible
such
topics
as
those
listed
in
activity
for
exercise
discourse
or
as
the
following
is
there
any
such
thing
as
luck
is
the
golden
rule
practicable
in
the
modern
business
world
is
modesty
rather
than
regarding
his
own
merits
and
abilities
the
better
policy
for
an
employee
are
substantial
girls
or
girls
rather
fast
and
frivolous
the
more
likely
to
obtain
good
husbands
is
it
desirable
for
a
young
man
to
take
out
life
insurance
is
better
than
collegiate
training
should
one
always
tell
the
truth
discuss
as
concretely
as
possible
the
topics
you
have
selected
from

illustrations
drawn
from

your

with
this
from

the

gables

words
how
many
of
them
are
color
words
how
many
motion
words
how
many
of
the
first
words
in
your
description
appeal
to
one
or
another
of
the
five
senses
narrate
as
vividly
as
possible
an
experience
in
your
own
life
compare
what
you
have
written
with
the
account
of
crusoe
escape
to
the
island
appendix
which
narrative
is
the
more
concrete
how
much
literal
figurative
terms
phraseology
is
literal
when
it
says
exactly
what
it
means
is
figurative
when
it
says
one
thing
but
really
means
another
thus
he
fought
bravely
is
literal
he
was
a
lion
in
the
fight
is
figurative
literal
phraseology
as
a
rule
appeals
to
our
scientific
or
understanding
faculties
figurative
to
our
emotional
faculties
here
again
as
with
abstraction
and
concreteness
you
should
learn
to
express
yourself
by
either
method
both
have
their
advantages
and
their
drawbacks
we
all
admire
the
man
who
has
observed
and
can
state
accurately
it
is
upon
this
belief
of
ours
in
the
literal
that
defoe
shrewdly
traffics
see
appendix
he
does
not
stir
us
as
some
writers
do
but
he
gains
our
implicit
confidence
dame
quickly
on
the
contrary
makes
egregious
use
of
the
literal
see
paragraph
above
exercise
wordiness
iii
above
her
facts
are
accurate
yes
but
how
strictly
how
unsparingly
accurate
and
how
many
of
them
are
beside
the
point
she
quite
convinces
us
that
the
devotee
of
the
literal
may
be
dull
an
advantage
of
the
figurative
also
is
that
it
may
make
meanings
lucid
thus
when
burke
near
the
close
of
his
discussion
appendix
wishes
to
make
it
clear
that
by
a
law
of
nature
the
authority
of
extensive
empires
is
slighter
in
its
more
remote
territories
he
has
recourse
to
a
figure
of
speech
in
large
bodies
the
circulation
of
power
must
be
less
vigorous
at
the
extremities
nature
has
said
it
more
often
however
the
function
of
the
figurative
is
to
drive
home
a
thought
or
a
mood
of
which
a
mere
statement
would
leave
us
unmoved
to
make
us
it
thus
burke
said
of
the
americans
their
love
of
liberty
as
with
you
fixed
and
attached
on
this
specific
point
of
taxing
he
added
here
they
felt
its
pulse
and
as
they
found
that
beat
they
thought
themselves
sick
or
sound
had
you
been
one
of
his
parliamentary
hearers
would
not
that
second
sentence
have
made
more
real
and
more
important
the
colonial
attitude
to
taxation
the
poets
of
course
make
frequent
and
noble
use
of
the
figurative
this
is
how
coleridge
tells
us
that
the
descent
of
a
tropical
night
is
sudden
the
sun
rim
dips
the
stars
rush
out
at
one
stride
comes
the
dark
the
words
and
one
stride
convert
the
stars
and
the
darkness
into
vast
beings
or
at
least
vast
personal
forces
the
comparisons
are
so
natural
as
to
seem
inevitable
we
are
transported
to
the
very
scene
and
feel
the
overwhelming
abruptness
of
the
nightfall
but
if
a
figure
of
speech
seems
artificial
if
it
is
strained
or
or
merely
decorative
it
subtracts
from
the
effectiveness
of
the
passage
thus
when
tennyson
says
when
the
breeze
of
a
joyful
dawn
blew
free
in
the
silken
sail
of
infancy
we
must
stop
and
ponder
before
we
perceive
that
what
he
means
is
when
i
was
a
happy
child
the
figure
is
like
an
exotic
plant
rather
than
a
natural
outgrowth
of
the
soil
it
appears
to
us
something
thought
up
and
stuck
on
it
is
a
parasite
rather
than
a
helper
of
course
as
with
abstraction
and
concreteness
you
should
develop
facility
in
gliding
from
literalness
to
figurativeness
and
back
again
but
you
are
always
to
remember
that
your
gymnastics
are
not
to
militate
against
verbal
concord
you
must
never
set
words
scowling
and
growling
at
each
other
through
injudicious
combinations
like
this
she
was
five
feet
four
and
inches
high
had
a
small
round
scar
between
her
nose
and
her
left

radiant
grace

only
see
as
through

connotation
the
connotation
of
a
word
is
the
subtle
implication
the
emotional
association
it
carries
often
quite
apart
from
its
dictionary
definition
thus
the
words
and
in
large
measure
overlap
in
meaning
but
emotionally
they
are
not
equivalents
at
all
you
can
say
without
experiencing
any
sensation
whatever
but
if
you
utter
the
word
it
will
call
back
however
slightly
tender
and
cherished
recollections
and
are
both
indicative
of
age
but
you
would
pronounce
the
former
in
disparaging
allusion
to
elderly
persons
and
the
latter
with
sentiments
of
veneration
you
would
say
of
a
clodpole
that
he
plays
the
but
of
fritz
kreisler
that
he
plays
the
and
just
as
you
unconsciously
adapt
words
to
feelings
in
these
obvious
instances
you
must
learn
on
peril
of
striking
false
notes
verbally
to
do
so
when
distinctions
are
less
gross
moreover
circumstance
as
well
as
sentiment
may
control
the
connotation
of
a
word
a
word
or
phrase
may
have
a
double
or
triple
connotation
and
depend
upon
vocal
inflection
upon
gesture

the
words
with
which
it
is
linked

the
experience
of
speaker
or
hearer

place
and
external
fact
or
upon
other
forces
outside
it
for
the
sense
in
which
it
is
to
be
taken
you
may
be
called
old
dog
in
an
insulting
manner
or
especially
if
a
slap
on
the
shoulder
accompanies
the
phrase
in
an
affectionate
manner
you
may
properly
say
calhoun

logic
on
his
side

however
the

but
his
face
was

the
past
and
you
spoil
the

to
slight
perhaps

momentary

disconcerting

over
the
funny
stories
you
have
heard
many
of

you
will
find
on
the
outcropping
of

in
a

of
its
environment

inquiring
my

you

who

anecdote
of

words
in

how
mastered
the
more
dangerous
pitfalls
for
those
who
use
words
in
combination
as
all
of
us
do
have
been
pointed
out
the
best
ways
of
avoiding
these
pitfalls
have
also
been
indicated
but
our
work
together
has
thus
far
been
chiefly
negative
to
be
sure
many
tasks
assigned
for
your
performance
have
been
constructive
as
well
as
precautionary
but
held
ever
before
you
has
been
the
avoidance
of
feeble
or
ridiculous
diction
in
the
present
chapter
we
must
take
up
those
aspects
of
the
mastery
of
words
in
combination
which
are
primarily
positive
preliminaries
general
purposes
and
methods
before
coming
to
specific
aspects
and
assignments
however
we
shall
do
well
to
consider
certain
large
general
purposes
and
methods
i
a
ready
an
accurate
or
a
wide
vocabulary
first
what
kind
of
vocabulary
do
we
wish
to
acquire
a
facile
readily
used
one
an
accurate
one
or
one
as
nearly
as
may
be
comprehensive
the
three
kinds
do
not
necessarily
coexist
the
possession
of
one
may
even
hinder
and
retard
the
acquisition
of
another
thus
if
we
seek
a
ready
vocabulary
an
accurate
vocabulary
may
cause
us
to
halt
and
hesitate
for
words
which
shall
correspond
with
the
shadings
of
our
thought
and
emotion
and
a
wide
vocabulary
may
embarrass
us
with
the
plenitude
of
our
verbal
riches
but
is
not
though
the
three
kinds
of
vocabulary
may
interfere
with
each
other
there
is
no
reason
except
superficially
why
they
should
our
purpose
should
be
therefore
to
acquire
not
a
single
kind
but
all
three
we
should
be
like
the
boy
who
when
asked
whether
he
would
have
a
small
slice
of
apple
pie
or
a
small
slice
of
pumpkin
pie
replied
resolutely
thank
you
i
will
take
a
large
piece
of
both
that
the
assignments
in
this
chapter
may
help
you
develop
a
vocabulary
which
shall
be
promptly
responsive
to
your
needs
you
should
perform
some
of
them
rapidly
your
thoughts
and
feelings
regarding
a
topic
may
be
anything
but
clear
but
you
must
not
pause
to
clarify
them
the
words
best
suited
to
the
matter
may
not
be
instantly
available
but
you
must
not
tarry
for
accessions
of
language
stumble
flounder
if
you
must
yea
rearrange
your
ideas
even
as
you
present
them
but
press
resolutely
ahead
comforting
yourself
with
the
assurance
that
in
the
heat
and
stress
of
circumstances
a
man
rarely
does
his
work
precisely
as
he
wishes
when
you
have
finished
the
discussion
repeat
it
immediately
and
with
no
more
loitering
than
before
you
will
find
that
your
ideas
have
shifted
and
enlarged
and
that
more
appropriate
words
have
become
available
further
repetitions
will
assist
you
the
more
but
the
goal
you
should
set
yourself
as
you
proceed
from
topic
to
topic
is
the
attainment
of
the
power
to
be
at
your
best
in
the
first
discussion
you
may
never
reach
this
goal
but
at
least
you
may
approach
it
that
the
assignments
in
this
chapter
may
assist
you
in
making
your
vocabulary
accurate
you
should
perform
some
of
them
in
another
way
when
you
have
selected
a
topic
you
should
first
of
all
think
it
through
in
doing
this
arrange
your
ideas
as
consistently
and
logically
as
you
can
and
test
them
with
your
reason
then
set
them
forth
in
language
which
shall
be
lucid
and
exact
tolerate
no
slipshod
diction
no
vaguely
rendered
general
meanings
send
every
sentence
every
word
like
a
skilful
straight
above
the
crossbar
when
you
have
done
your
best
with
the
topic
lay
it
by
for
a
space
time
is
a
great
revealer
of
hidden
defects
and
you
must
not
regard
your
labors
as
ended
until
your
achievement
is
the
maturest
possible
for
you
if
the
quantity
of
what
you
accomplish
is
meager
suffer
no
distress
on
that
account
the
desideratum
now
is
not
quantity
but
quality
the
assignments
in
this
chapter
will
do
less
toward
making
your
vocabulary
wide
than
toward
making
it
facile
and
precise
to
be
sure
they
will
now
and
then
set
you
to
hunting
for
words
that
are
new
better
still
they
will
give
you
a
mastery
over
some
of
your
outlying
words
words
known
to
your
eyes
or
ears
but
not
to
your
tongue
but
these
advantages
will
be
somewhat
incidental
means
for
the
systematic
extension
of
your
verbal
domain
into
regions
as
yet
unexplored
by
you
are
reserved
for
the
later
chapters
of
this
book
a
vocabulary
for
speech
or
for
writing
in
the
second
place
are
we
to
develop
a
vocabulary
for
oral
discourse
or
a
vocabulary
for
writing
it
may
be
that
our
chief
impediment
or
our
chief
ambition
lies
in
one
field
rather
than
in
the
other
nevertheless
we
should
strive
for
a
double
mastery
we
ought
to
speak
well
write
well
indeed
the
two
powers
so
react
upon
each
other
that
we
ought
to
cultivate
both
for
the
sake
of
either
true
some
men
though
inexpert
as
writers
have
made
themselves
proficient
as
speakers
or
though
shambling
and
ineffective
as
speakers
have
made
themselves
proficient
as
writers
but
this
is
not
natural
or
normal
moreover
these
men
might
have
gleaned
more
abundantly
from
their
chosen
field
had
they
not
shut
it
off
from
the
acres
adjacent
fences
waste
space
and
curtail
harvests
the
assignments
in
this
chapter
are
of
such
a
nature
that
you
may
perform
them
either
orally
or
in
writing
you
should
speak
and
write
alternately
sometimes
on
the
same
topic
sometimes
on
topics
taken
in
rotation
in
your
oral
discussions
you
should
perhaps
absent
yourself
at
first
from
human
auditors
a
bedstead
or
a
dresser
will
not
make
you
or
in
any
way
distract
your
attention
and
it
will
permit
you
to
sit
down
afterward
and
think
out
the
degree
of
your
failure
or
success
ultimately
of
course
you
must
speak
to
human
beings
in
informal
conversations
at
the
outset
in
more
ambitious
ways
later
as
occasion
permits
in
your
writing
you
may
find
it
advantageous
to
make
preliminary
outlines
of
what
you
wish
to
say
but
above
all
you
must
be
willing
to
blot
to
revise
to
take
infinite
pains
you
should
remember
the
old
admonition
that
easy
reading
is
devilish
hard
writing
the
mastery
of
words
in
combination
these
purposes
and
methods
are
general
we
now
come
to
the
specific
fields
in
which
we
may
with
profit
cultivate
words
in
combination
of
these
fields
there
are
four
i
mastery
through
translation
if
you
read
a
foreign
language
whether
laboriously
or
with
ease
you
should
make
this
power
assist
you
to
amass
a
good
english
vocabulary
take
compositions
or
parts
of
compositions
written
in
the
foreign
tongue
and
turn
them
into
idiomatic
english
how
much
you
should
translate
at
a
given
time
depends
upon
your
leisure
and
your
adeptness
employ
all
the
methods
the
spontaneous
the
carefully
perfected
the
oral
the
written
heretofore
explained
in
this
chapter
in
your
final
work
on
a
passage
you
should
aim
at
a
faultless
rendition
and
should
spend
time
and
ransack
the
lexicons
rather
than
come
short
of
this
ideal
the
habit
of
translation
is
an
excellent
habit
to
keep
up
for
the
study
of
an
alien
tongue
not
only
improves
your
english
but
has
compensations
in
itself
exercise
translation
translate
from
any
accessible
book
in
the
foreign
language
you
can
read
subscribe
for
a
period
of
at
least
two
or
three
months
for
a
newspaper
or
magazine
in
that
language
if
it
is
a
modern
one
translate
as
before
but
give
most
of
your
time
to
rapid
oral
translation
for
a
real
or
imaginary
american
hearer
when
you
have
completed
your
final
written
translation
of
a
passage
from
the
foreign
language
make
yourself
master
of
all
the
english
words
you
have
not
previously
known
or
used
but
have
encountered
in
your
work
of
translation
mastery
through
paraphrasing
it
may
be
that
you
are
not
familiar
with
a
foreign
language
at
any
rate
you
have
some
knowledge
of
english
put
this
knowledge
to
use
in
paraphrasing
for
thus
you
will
enrich
your
vocabulary
and
make
it
surer
and
more
flexible
the
process
of
paraphrasing
is
simple
though
the
actual
work
is
not
easy
you
take
passages
written
in
english
the
more
of
them
the
better
and
the
more
diversified
the
better
and
both
reproduce
their
substance
and
incarnate
their
mood
in
words
you
yourself
shall
choose
you
may
have
a
passage
before
you
and
paraphrase
it
unit
by
unit
more
often
however
you
should
follow
the
plan
adopted
by
franklin
when
he
emulated
addison
by
rewriting
the
that
is
you
should
steep
yourself
in
the
thought
and
emotion
of
a
piece
of
writing
and
then
lay
the
piece
aside
until
its
wording
has
faded
from
your
memory
when
you
should
reëmbody
the
substance
in
language
that
seems
to
you
natural
and
fitting
much
of
the
benefit
will
come
from
your
comparing
your
version
as
franklin
did
his
with
the
original
when
you
perceive
that
you
have
fallen
short
you
should
consider
the
respects
wherein
your
inferiority
lies
and
should
make
another
attempt
and
yet
another
and
another
when
you
perceive
that
in
any
way
you
have
surpassed
the
original
you
should
feel
a
just
pride
in
your
achievement
and
should
resolve
that
next
time
your
cause
for
pride
shall
be
greater
still
even
after
you
have
desisted
from
formal
paraphrasing
you
should
cling
to
the
habit
formed
at
this
time
of
observing
any
notable
felicities
in
whatever
you
read
and
of
comparing
them
with
the
expression
you
yourself
would
likely
have
employed

the
editorial
in

you
should
improve
upon
the
original

trying
until
you
do
paraphrase
the
second
paragraph
in
burke
speech
appendix
burke
lacked
the
cheap
tricks
of
the
ordinary
orator
but
his
discussions
were
based
upon
a
comprehensive
knowledge
of
facts
a
sympathetic
understanding
of
human
nature
a
vast
depth
and
range
of
thought
and
a

can

employs

forth

his
full
accompaniments

you
will
be
bewildered

condense
your
paraphrase
as
much
as
you
can
in
each
of
the
preceding
exercises
compare
your
vocabulary
with
that
of
the
original
as
to
size
precision
and
the
grace
and
ease
with
which
words
are
put
together
does
the
original
employ
terms
unfamiliar
to
you
if
so
look
up
their
meaning
and
make
them
yours
then
observe
when
you
next
paraphrase
the
passage
whether
your
mastery
of
these
terms
has
improved
your
expression
mastery
through
discourse
at
first
hand
models
have
their
use
but
you
can
also
work
without
models
it
is
imperative
that
you
should
you
must
learn
to
discuss
explain
analyze
argue
narrate
and
describe
for
yourself
here
again
you
should
diversify
your
materials
to
the
utmost
not
only
that
you
may
become
and
versatile
in
your
ability
to
set
forth
ideas
and
feelings
in
words
but
also
that
your
knowledge
and
your
sensibility
may
receive
stimulation
it
is
feasible
to
begin
by
discussing
or
explaining
most
of
the
intercourse
conducted
through
language
consists
in
either
discussion
or
explanation
analysis
ordinarily
is
almost
ignored
argument
is
indulged
in
and
so
is
description
though
less
freely
but
they
are
of
the
bluntest
and
broadest
narration
the
recounting
of
incidents
of
everyday
existence
is
however
widely
employed
in
your
work
of
discussion
or
explanation
you
may
seize
upon
any
current
topic
industrial
social
political
or
what
not
that
comes
into
your
mind
or
you
may
make
a
list
of
such
topics
writing
each
on
a
separate
piece
of
paper
may
jumble
the
slips
in
a
hat
and
may
thus
have
always
at
your
elbow
a
collection
of
satisfactory
themes
from
which
you
may
take
one
at
random
or
you
may
invest
in
language
of
your
own
selection
the
substance
of
an
address
or
sermon
you
have
heard
or
give
the
burden
of
some
important
conversation
in
which
you
have
participated
or
explain
the
tenor
of
an
article
you
have
read
you
should
of
course
try
to
interest
your
hearers
and
above
all
you
should
impart
to
what
you
say
complete
clarity
in
analyzing
you
should
select
as
your
topic
a
process
fairly
obscure
the
implications
of
a
certain
statement
or
argument
the
results
to
be
expected
from
some
action
or
policy
that
has
been
advocated
or
the
exact
matter
at
issue
between
two
disputants
any
topic
for
discussion
explanation
or
argument
may
be
treated
analytically
your
analysis
in
its
final
form
should
be
so
carefully
considered
that
its
soundness
can
not
be
impeached
in
arguing
you
may
take
any
subject
under
the
sun
from
baseball
to
bolshevism
for
all
of
them
are
debated
with
vehemence
any
topic
for
discussion
or
explanation
becomes
when
approached
from
some
particular
angle
material
for
argument
thus
the
initial
topic
in
the
exercise
that
follows
is
the
aeroplane
future
as
a
carrier
of
mail
you
may
convert
it
into
a
question
for
debate
by
making
it
read
the
aeroplane
is
destined
to
supplant
the
railroad
as
a
carrier
of
mail
or
the
aeroplane
is
destined
to
be
used
increasingly
as
a
carrier
of
transcontinental
mail
in
arguing
you
may
propose
for
yourself
either
of
two
objectives
to
silence
your
opponent
to
refute
persuade
and
win
him
over
fairly
the
achievement
of
the
first
end
calls
for
bluster
and
perhaps
a
grim
barbaric
strength
you
must
do
as
johnson
did
according
to
goldsmith
famous
dictum
if
your
pistol
misses
fire
you
must
knock
your
adversary
down
with
the
butt
end
of
it
this
procedure
though
inartistic
to
be
sure
is
in
some
contingencies
the
only
kind
that
will
serve
but
you
should
cultivate
procedure
of
a
type
more
urbane
let
your
very
reasonableness
be
the
most
potent
weapon
you
wield
to
this
end
you
should
form
the
habit
of
looking
for
good
points
on
both
sides
of
a
question
as
a
still
further
precaution
against
contentiousness
you
should
uphold
the
two
sides
successively
in
narrating
you
should
as
a
rule
stick
to
simple
occurrences
though
you
may
occasionally
vary
your
work
by
summarizing
the
plot
of
a
novel
or
giving
the
gist
and
drift
of
big
historical
events
you
should
confine
yourself
in
large
part
to
incidents
in
which
you
have
been
personally
involved
or
which
you
yourself
have
witnessed
as
mishaps
unexpected
encounters
bickerings
even
rescues
or
riots
you
should
omit
and
make
the
happening
itself
live
for
your
hearer
if
you
can
so
interest
him
in
it
that
he
will
not
notice
your
manner
of
telling
it
your
success
is
but
the
greater
finally
in
describing
you
should
deal
for
the
most
part
with
beings
objects
and
appearances
familiar
to
you
description
is
usually
hard
to
make
vivid
this
is
because
the
objects
and
scenes
are
likely
to
be
immobile
and
at
least
when
told
about
to
lack
distinctiveness
try
therefore
to
lay
hold
of
the
peculiar
quality
of
the
thing
described
and
use
words
suggestive
of
color
and
motion
moreover
be
brief

sure
to
be
wearisome

mastery
through
adapting
discourse
to

for
convenience
we
have
heretofore
assumed
that
ideas
and
emotions
together
with
such
expression
of
them
as
shall
be
in
itself
adequate
and
faithful
comprise
the
sole
elements
that
have
to
be
reckoned
with
in
the
use
of
words
in

but
as
you
go
out
into
life
you
will
find
that
these
things
however
complete
they
may
seem
are
not
in
practice
sufficient
another
factor
the
human
must
have
its
place
in
our
equation
you
do
not
speak
or
write
in
a
vacuum
your
object
your
ultimate
object
at
least
in
building
up
your
vocabulary
is
to
address
men
and
women
and
among
men
and
women
the
varieties
of
training
of
stations
of
outlooks
of
sentiments
of
prejudices
of
caprices
are
infinite
to
gain
an
unbiased
hearing
you
must
take
persistent
cognizance
of
flesh
and
blood
in
adapting
discourse
to
audience
you
must
have
a
supple
and
attentive
mind
and
an
impressionable
and
swiftly
responsive
temperament
as
well
as
a
wide
accurate
and
flexible
vocabulary
unless
you
are
a
fool
a
zealot
or
an
incorrigible
adventurer
you
will
not
broach
a
subject
at
all
to
which
your
hearers
feel
absolute
indifference
or
hostility
normally
you
should
pick
a
subject
capable
of
interesting
them
in
presenting
it
you
should
pay
heed
to
both
your
matter
and
your
manner
you
should
emphasize
for
your
listeners
those
aspects
of
the
subject
which
they
will
most
respond
to
or
most
need
to
hear
whether
or
not
the
phases
be
such
as
you
would
emphasize
with
other
auditors
you
should
also
speak
in
the
fashion
you
deem
most
effective
with
them
whether
or
not
it
be
one
to
which
your
own
natural
instincts
prompt
you
let
us
say
you
are
discussing
conditions
in
europe
you
must
speak
in
one
way
to
the
man
who
has
traveled
and
in
an
entirely
different
way
to
the
man
who
has
never
gone
abroad
in
one
way
to
the
man
in
an
entirely
different
way
to
the
ignoramus
let
us
say
you
are
discussing
urban
life
urban
problems
you
must
speak
in
one
way
to
the
man
who
lives
in
the
city
in
another
to
the
man
who
lives
in
the
country
let
us
say
you
are
discussing
the
labor
problem
you
must
speak
in
one
way
to
employers
in
another
to
employees
possibly
in
a
third
to
men
thrown
out
of
jobs
possibly
in
a
fourth
to
the
general
public
let
us
say
you
are
discussing
education
or
literature
or
social
tendencies
or
mechanical
principles
or
processes
or
some
great
enterprise
or
movement
you
must
speak
in
one
way
to
cultivated
hearers
and
in
another
to
men
in
the
street
and
if
you
are
a
specialist
addressing
specialists
you
will
cut
the
garment
of
your
discourse
to
their
particular
measure
the
same
principle
holds
regardless
of
whether
you
expound
analyze
argue
recount
or
describe
you
must
always
keep
a
finger
on
the
mental
or
emotional
pulse
of
those
whom
you
address
but
your
problem
varies
slightly
with
the
form
of
discourse
you
adopt
in
explanation
analysis
and
argument
the
chief
barriers
you
encounter
are
likely
to
be
those
of
the
mind
you
must
make
due
allowance
for
the
intellectual
limitations
of
your
auditors
though
many
who
have
capacity
enough
may
for
some
cause
or
other
be
unreceptive
to
ideas
in
description
you
must
reckon
with
the
imaginative
faculty
with
the
possibility
that
your
hearers
can
not
visualize

iv
individual
words
as
verbal
celibates
thus
far
we
have
studied
words
as
grouped
together
into
phrases
sentences
paragraphs
whole
compositions
we
must
now
enter
upon
a
new
phase
of
our
efforts
to
extend
our
vocabulary
we
must
study
words
as
individual
entities
you
may
think
the
order
of
our
study
should
be
reversed
no
great
harm
would
result
if
it
were
the
learning
of
individual
words
and
the
combining
of
them
into
sentences
are
parallel
rather
than
successive
processes
in
our
babyhood
we
do
not
accumulate
a
large
stock
of
terms
before
we
frame
phrases
and
clauses
and
our
attainment
of
the
power
of
continuous
iteration
does
not
check
our
inroads
among
individual
words
we
do
the
two
things
simultaneously
each
contributing
to
our
success
with
the
other
there
are
plenty
of
analogies
for
this
procedure
a
good
baseball
player
for
instance
tirelessly
studies
both
the
minutiae
of
his
technique
as
how
to
hold
a
bat
how
to
stand
at
the
plate
and
the
big
combinations
and
possibilities
of
the
game
a
good
musician
keeps
unremitting
command
over
every
possible
touch
of
each
key
and
at
the
same
time
seeks
sweeping
mastery
over
vast
and
complex
harmonies
so
we
if
we
would
have
the
obedience
of
our
vocabularies
dare
not
lag
into
desultory
attention
to
either
words
when
disjoined
or
words
as
potentially
combined
into
the
larger
units
of
thought
and
feeling
we
might
therefore
consider
either
the
individuals
first
or
the
groups
first
but
the
majority
of
speakers
and
writers
pay
more
heed
to
rough
general
substance
than
to
separate
instruments
and
items
hence
we
have
thought
best
to
begin
where
most
work
is
going
on
already
with
words
in
combination
as
you
turn
from
the
groups
to
the
individuals
you
must
understand
that
your
labors
will
be
onerous
and
detailed
you
must
not
assume
that
by
nature
all
words
are
much
alike
any
more
than
you
assume
that
all
men
are
much
alike
of
course
the
similarities
are
many
and
striking
and
the
fundamental
fact
is
that
a
word
is
a
word
as
a
man
is
a
man
but
you
will
be
no
adept
in
handling
either
the
one
or
the
other
until
your
knowledge
goes
much
farther
than
this
let
us
glance
first
at
the
human
variations
each
man
has
his
own
business
and
conducts
it
in
his
own
way
a
way
never
absolutely
matched
with
that
of
any
other
mortal
being
all
this
you
may
see
but
besides
the
man
visible
employment
he
may
be
connected
in
devious
fashions
with
a
score
of
enterprises
the
public
knows
nothing
about
furthermore
he
leads
a
private
life
again
not
precisely
corresponding
to
that
of
any
other
has
his
hobbies
and
aversions
is
stamped
with
a
character
a
temperament
of
his
own
in
short
though
in
thousands
of
respects
he
is
like
his
fellows
he
has
after
all
no
human
counterpart
he
is
a
distinct
individual
self
to
know
him
to
use
him
to
count
upon
his
service
in
whatsoever
contingency
it
might
bestead
you
you
must
deem
him
something
more
than
a
member
of
the
great
human
family
you
must
cultivate
him
personally
cultivate
him
without
weariness
or
stint
and
undergo
inconvenience
in
so
doing
even
so
with
a
word
commonplace
enough
it
may
seem
but
it
has
its
peculiar
characteristics
its
activities
undisclosed
except
to
the
curious
its
subtle
inclinations
its
repugnances
its
latent
potentialities
there
is
no
precise
duplicate
for
it
in
all
the
wide
domain
of
language
to
know
it
intimately
and
thoroughly
to
be
on
entirely
free
terms
with
it
to
depend
upon
it
just
so
far
as
dependence
is
safe
to
have
a
sure
understanding
of
what
it
can
do
and
what
it
can
not
you
must
arduously
cultivate
it
words
like
people
yield
themselves
to
the
worthy
they
hunger
for
friendship
and
lack
the
last
barrier
of
reserve
which
hedges
all
human
communion
thus
linguistically
speaking
you
must
search
out
the
individuals
you
must
step
aside
from
your
way
for
the
sake
of
a
new
acquaintance
in
conversations
in
sermons
in
addresses
in
letters
in
journalistic
columns
in
standard
literature
you
must
grasp
the
stranger
by
the
hand
and
look
him
straight
in
the
eye
nor
must
you
treat
cavalierly
the
words
you
know
already
you
must
study
them
afresh
you
must
learn
them
over
and
learn
them
better
you
must
come
to
understand
them
not
only
for
what
they
are
but
for
what
they
will
do
what
words
to
learn
first
what
then
is
your
first
task
somebody
has
laid
down
the
injunction
and
as
always
when
anything
is
enjoined
others
have
given
it
currency
that
each
day
you
should
learn
two
new
words
so
be
it
but
which
two
the
first
two
in
the
dictionary
or
hitherto
left
untouched
in
your
systematic
conquest
of
the
dictionary
the
first
two
you
hear
spoken
the
first
two
that
stare
at
you
from
casual
everyday
print
the
first
two
you
can
ferret
from
some
technical
jargon
some
special
department
of
human
interest
or
endeavor
in
any
of
these
ways
you
may
obey
the
behest
of
these
mentors
but
are
not
such
ways
arbitrary
haphazard
and
suppose
after
doing
your
daily
stint
you
should
encounter
a
word
it
behooves
you
to
know
what
then
are
you
to
sulk
to
withhold
yourself
from
further
exertion
on
the
plea
of
a
day
to
adopt
any
of
the
methods
designated
would
be
like
resolving
to
invest
in
city
lots
and
then
buying
properties
as
you
encountered
them
with
no
regard
for
expenditure
for
value
in
general
or
for
special
serviceability
to
you
surely
such
procedure
would
be
unbusinesslike
if
you
pay
out
good
money
you
meditate
well
whether
that
which
you
receive
for
it
shall
compensate
you
likewise
if
you
devote
time
and
effort
to
gaining
ownership
of
words
you
should
exercise
foresight
in
determining
whether
they
will
yield
you
commensurate
returns
what
then
is
the
principle
upon
which
at
the
outset
you
should
proceed
what
better
than
to
insure
the
possession
of
the
words
regarding
which
you
know
this
already
that
you
need
them
and
should
make
them
yours
the
analysis
of
your
own
vocabulary
the
natural
way
and
the
best
to
begin
is
with
an
analysis
of
your
own
vocabulary
you
are
of
course
aware
that
of
the
enormous
number
of
words
contained
in
the
dictionary
relatively
few
are
at
your
beck
and
bidding
but
probably
you
have
made
no
attempt
to
ascertain
the
nature
and
extent
of
your
actual
linguistic
resources
you
should
make
an
inventory
of
the
stock
on
hand
before
sending
in
your
order
for
additional
goods
you
will
speedily
discover
that
your
vocabulary
embraces
several
distinct
classes
of
words
of
these
the
first
consists
of
those
words
which
you
have
at
your
tongue
end
which
you
can
summon
without
effort
and
use
in
your
daily
speech
they
are
old
verbal
friends
numbered
with
them
to
be
sure
there
may
be
a
few
with
senses
and
connotations
you
are
ignorant
of
friends
of
yours
let
us
say
with
a
reservation
even
these
you
may
woo
with
a
little
care
into
uncurbed
fraternal
abandon
with
the
exception
of
these
few
you
know
the
words
of
the
first
class
so
well
that
without
thinking
about
it
at
all
you
may
rely
upon
their
giving
you
the
moment
you
need
them
their
untempered
uttermost
service
you
need
be
at
no
further
pains
about
them
they
are
yours
already
a
second
class
of
words
is
made
up
of
those
you
speak
on
occasions
either
special
or
formal
occasions
when
you
are
trying
perhaps
not
to
show
off
but
at
least
to
put
your
best
linguistic
foot
foremost
some
of
them
have
a
meaning
you
are
not
quite
sure
of
some
of
them
seem
too
ostentatious
for
workaday
purposes
some
of
them
you
might
have
been
using
but
somehow
have
not
words
of
this
class
are
not
your
bosom
friends
they
are
your
speaking
acquaintance
or
perhaps
a
little
better
than
that
you
must
convert
them
into
friends
into
prompt
and
staunch
supporters
in
time
of
need
that
is
to
say
you
must
put
them
into
class
one
in
bringing
about
this
change
of
footing
you
yourself
must
make
the
advances
you
must
say
go
to
i
will
bear
them
in
mind
as
i
would
a
person
i
wished
to
cultivate
when
occasion
rises
you
must
introduce
them
into
your
talk
you
will
feel
a
bit
shy
about
it
for
introductions
are
difficult
to
accomplish
gracefully
you
will
steal
a
furtive
glance
at
your
hearer
perchance
and
another
at
the
word
itself
as
you
would
when
first
labeling
a
man
my
friend
mr
blank
but
the
embarrassment
is
momentary
and
there
is
no
other
way
assume
a
friendship
if
you
have
it
not
and
presently
the
friendship
will
be
real
you
must
be
steadfast
in
intention
for
the
words
that
have
held
aloof
from
you
are
many
and
to
unloose
all
at
once
on
a
single
victim
would
brand
you
criminal
but
you
will
make
sure
headway
and
will
be
conscious
besides
that
no
other
class
of
words
in
the
language
will
so
well
repay
the
mastering
for
these
are
words
you
use
and
need
to
use
more
and
more
freely
words
your
own
experience
stamps
as
valuable
if
not
indeed
vital
to
you
the
third
class
of
words
is
made
up
of
those
you
do
not
speak
at
all
but
sometimes
write
they
are
acquaintance
one
degree
farther
removed
than
those
of
the
second
class
your
task
is
to
bring
them
into
class
two
and
thence
into
class
one
that
is
to
introduce
them
into
your
more
formal
speech
and
from
this
gradually
into
your
everyday
speech
the
fourth
class
of
words
is
made
up
of
those
you
recognize
when
you
hear
or
read
them
but
yourself
never
employ
they
are
acquaintance
of
a
very
distant
kind
you
nod
to
them
let
us
say
and
they
to
you
but
there
the
intercourse
ends
obviously
they
are
not
to
be
brought
without
considerable
effort
into
a
position
of
tried
and
trusted
friendship
and
shall
we
be
absolutely
honest
some
of
them
may
not
justify
such
assiduous
care
as
their
complete
subjugation
would
call
for
but
even
these
you
should
make
your
feudal
retainers
you
should
constrain
them
to
membership
in
class
three
and
at
your
discretion
in
class
two
apart
from
the
words
in
class
four
you
will
not
to
this
point
have
made
actual
additions
to
your
vocabulary
but
you
will
have
made
your
vocabulary
infinitely
more
serviceable
you
will
be
like
a
man
with
a
host
of
friends
where
before
when
his
necessities
were
sorest
he
found
along
with
some
friends
many
distant
and
timid
acquaintance
outside
the
bounds
of
your
present
vocabulary
altogether
are
the
words
you
encounter
but
do
not
recognize
except
it
may
be
dimly
and
uncertainly
some
counselors
would
have
you
look
up
all
such
words
in
a
dictionary
but
the
task
would
be
irksome
moreover
those
who
prescribe
it
are
loath
to
perform
it
themselves
your
own
candid
judgment
in
the
matter
is
the
safest
guide
if
the
word
is
incidental
rather
than
vital
to
the
meaning
of
the
passage
that
contains
it
and
if
it
gives
promise
of
but
rarely
crossing
your
vision
again
you
should
deign
it
no
more
than
a
civil
glance
plenty
of
ways
will
be
left
you
to
expend
time
wisely
in
the
service
of
your
vocabulary
exercise
analysis
make
a
list
of
the
words
in
class
two
of
your
own
vocabulary
and
similar
lists
for
classes
three
and
four
to
make
a
list
for
class
one
would
be
but
a
waste
of
time
procure
if
you
can
for
this
purpose
a
notebook
and
in
the
several
lists
reserve
a
full
page
for
each
letter
of
the
alphabet
as
used
initially
do
not
scamp
the
lists
though
their
proper
preparation
consume
many
days
many
weeks
try
to
make
them
really
exhaustive
their
value
will
be
in
proportion
to
their
accuracy
and
fulness
con
the
words
in
each
list
carefully
and
repeatedly
your
task
is
to
transfer
these
words
into
a

you
are
then
to
promote
again
the
words
in
the
lower
classes
except
that
if
your
judgment
so
dictates
you
may
leave
the
new
class
three
wholly
or
partially
intact
to
carry
out
this
exercise
properly
you
must
keep
these
words
in
mind
make
them
part
and
parcel
of
your
daily
life
for
a
special
device
for
bringing
them
under
subjection
see
the
next
exercise
to
write
a
word
down
helps
you
to
remember
it
that
is
why
the
normal
way
to
transfer
a
word
from
class
four
into
class
two
is
to
put
it
temporarily
into
the
intermediary
class
three
you
first
or
the
word
next
it
afterwards
it
the
mere
writing
down
of
your
lists
has
probably
done
much
to
bring
the
words
written
into
the
circuit
of
your
memory
where
you
can
more
readily
lay
hold
of
them
also
it
has
fortified
your
confidence
in
using
them
for
to
write
a
word
out
letter
by
letter
makes
you
surer
that
you
have
its
right
form
with
many
of
your
words
you
will
likely
have
no
more
trouble
they
will
be
at
hand
anxious
for
employment
and
you
may
use
them
according
to
your
need
but
some
of
your
words
will
still
stubbornly
withhold
themselves
from
memory
weed
these
out
from
your
lists
make
a
special
list
of
them
copy
it
frequently
construct
short
sentences
into
which
the
troublesome
words
fit
by
dint
of
writing
the
words
so
often
you
will
soon
make
them
more
tractable
make
a
fifth
list
of
words
those
you
hear
or
see
printed
do
not
understand
the
meaning
of
but
yet
feel
you
should
know
obtain
and
confirm
a
grasp
of
them
by
the
successive
processes
used
with
words
in
the
preceding
lists
the
definition
of
words
another
means
of
buttressing
your
command
of
your
present
vocabulary
is
to
define
words
you
use
or
are
familiar
with
do
not
bewilder
yourself
with
words
like
which
call
for
ingenuity
in
handling
somewhat
technical
terms
or
with
words
like
affair
which
loosely
cover
a
multitude
of
meanings
you
may
however
concentrate
your
efforts
upon
some
one
meaning
of
words
in
the
latter
group
select
words
with
a
fairly
definite
signification
and
express
this
as
precisely
as
you
can
you
may
afterwards
consult
a
dictionary
for
means
of
checking
up
on
what
you
have
done
but
in
consulting
it
think
only
of
idea
not
of
form
you
are
not
training
yourself
in
dictionary
definitions
but
in
the
sharpness
and
clarity
of
your
understanding
of
meanings
about
the
only
rule
to
be
laid
down
regarding
the
definition
of
verbs
adjectives
and
adverbs
is
that
you
must
not
define
a
word
in
terms
of
itself
thus
if
you
define
as
in
a
grudging
manner
you
do
not
dissipate
your
hearer
uncertainty
as
to
what
the
word
means
if
you
define
it
as
unwillingly
or
in
a
manner
that
shows
reluctance
to
yield
possession
you
give
your
hearer
a
idea
in
no
wise
dependent
upon
his
ability
to
understand
the
word
that
puzzled
him
in
the
first
place
normally
in
defining
a
noun
you
should
assign
the
thing
named
to
a
general
class
and
to
its
special
limits
within
that
class
in
other
words
you
should
designate
its
genus
and
species
you
must
take
care
to
differentiate
the
species
from
all
others
comprised
within
the
genus
you
will
in
most
instances
first
indicate
the
genus
and
then
the
species
but
at
your
convenience
you
may
indicate
the
species
first
thus
if
you
affirm
a
cigar
is
in
the
form
of
a
roll
of
you
name
the
genus
first
and
later
the
characteristics
of
the
species
you
have
given
a
satisfactory
definition
if
on
the
other
hand
you
affirm
a
cigar
is
a
roll
of
meant
for
smoking
you
first
designate
the
species
and
then
merely
imply
the
genus
again
you
have
given
a
satisfactory
definition
for
you
have
permitted
no
doubt
that
the
genus
is
and
have
prescribed
such
limits
for
the
species
as
exclude
tobacco
intended
for
a
pipe
or
a
cigarette
in
defining
nouns
by
the
method
restrict
the
genus
to
the
narrowest
possible
bounds
you
will
thus
save
the
need
for
exclusions
later
had
you
in
your
first
definition
of
a
cigar
begun
by
saying
that
it
is
tobacco
rather
than
you
would
have
violated
this
principle
and
you
would
have
had
to
amplify
the
rest
of
your
definition
in
order
to
exclude
snuff
and
the
like
exercise
definition
define
words
of
your
own
choosing
in
accordance
with
the
principles
laid
down
in
the

define
the

how
to
look
up
a
word
in
the
dictionary
so
much
for
the
words
which
are
already
yours
or
which
you
can
make
yours
through
your
own
unaided
efforts
for
convenience
we
have
grouped
with
them
some
words
of
a
nature
more
baffling
words
of
which
you
know
perhaps
but
a
single
aspect
rather
than
the
totality
or
upon
which
you
can
obtain
but
a
feeble
and
precarious
grip
these
slightly
known
words
belong
more
to
the
class
now
to
be
considered
than
to
that
just
disposed
of
for
we
have
now
to
deal
with
words
over
which
you
can
establish
no
genuine
rulership
unless
you
have
outside
help
you
must
own
a
dictionary
have
it
by
you
consult
it
carefully
and
often
do
not
select
one
for
purchasing
upon
the
basis
of
either
mere
bigness
or
cheapness
if
you
do
you
may
make
yourself
the
owner
of
an
reprint
from
stereotyped
plates
what
to
choose
depends
partly
upon
personal
preference
partly
upon
whether
your
need
is
for
comprehensiveness
or
compression
if
you
are
a
scholar
english
may
be
the
publication
for
you
but
if
you
are
an
ordinary
person
you
will
probably
content
yourself
with
something
less
expensive
and
exhaustive
you
will
find
the
dictionary
and
in
twelve
volumes
or
new
international
an
admirable
compilation
the
standard
will
also
prove
useful
all
in
all
if
you
can
afford
it
you
should
provide
yourself
with
one
or
the
other
of
these
three
large
and
authoritative
but
not
too
inclusive
works
of
the
smaller
lexicons
collegiate
dictionary
webster
secondary
school
the
standard
and
the
standard
answer
most
purposes
well
a
dictionary
is
not
for
show
you
must
learn
to
use
it
what
ordinarily
passes
for
use
is
in
fact
abuse
wherein
let
us
say
that
you
turn
to
your
lexicon
for
the
meaning
of
a
word
of
the
various
definitions
given
you
disregard
all
save
the
one
which
enables
the
word
to
make
sense
in
its
present
context
or
which
fits
your
preconception
of
what
the
word
should
stand
for
having
engaged
in
this
solemn
mummery
you
mentally
record
the
fact
that
you
have
been
squandering
your
time
and
enter
into
a
compact
with
yourself
that
no
more
will
you
so
do
at
best
you
have
tided
over
a
transitory
need
or
have
verified
a
surmise
you
have
not
truly
the
word
brought
it
into
a
vassal
relationship
with
you
so
fixed
it
in
memory
that
henceforth
night
or
day
you
can
take
it
up
like
a
familiar
tool
this
procedure
is
blundering
farcical
futile
incorrect
to
suppose
you
have
learned
a
word
by
so
cursory
a
glance
at
its
resources
is
like
supposing
you
have
learned
a
man
through
having
had
him
render
you
some
temporary
and
trivial
service
as
lending
you
a
match
or
telling
you
the
time
of
day
to
acquaint
yourself
thoroughly
with
a
word
or
a
man
involves
effort
application
you
must
go
about
the
work
seriously
intelligently
one
secret
of
consulting
a
dictionary
properly
lies
in
finding
the
primary
the
original
meaning
of
the
word
you
must
go
to
the
source
if
the
word
is
of
recent
formation
and
is
native
rather
than
naturalized
english
you
have
only
to
look
through
the
definitions
given
such
a
word
will
not
cause
you
much
trouble
but
if
the
word
is
derived
from
primitive
english
or
from
a
foreign
language
you
must
seek
its
origin
not
in
one
of
the
numbered
subheads
of
the
definition
but
in
an
etymological
record
you
will
perceive
within
brackets
or
parentheses
here
you
will
find
the
old
english
latin
greek
french
german
italian
scandinavian
or
other
word
from
which
sprang
the
word
you
are
studying
and
along
with
this
authentic
original
you
may
find
cognate
words
in
other
languages
these
you
may
examine
if
you
care
to
observe
their
resemblance
to
your
word
but
the
examination
is
not
necessary
it
could
teach
you
only
the
earlier
or
other
of
your
word
whereas
what
you
are
after
is
the
original
this
too
is
set
down
within
the
brackets
if
your
search
is
in
earnest
you
can
not
possible
miss
it
and
having
discovered
this
original
meaning
you
must
get
it
in
mind
it
is
one
of
the
really
significant
things
about
the
word
your
next
step
is
to
find
the
present
import
of
the
word
look
therefore
through
the
modern
definitions
of
these
there
may
be
too
many
with
too
delicate
shadings
in
thought
between
them
for
you
to
keep
all
clearly
in
mind
in
fact
you
need
not
try
consider
them
of
course
but
out
of
them
seek
mainly
the
drift
the
central
meaning
after
a
little
practice
you
will
be
able
to
disengage
it
from
the
others
you
now
know
the
original
sense
of
the
word
and
its
central
signification
today
the
two
may
be
identical
they
may
be
widely
different
but
through
reflection
or
study
of
the
entire
definition
you
will
establish
some
sort
of
connection
between
them
when
you
have
done
this
you
have
mastered
the
word
from
the
two
meanings
you
can
surmise
the
others
wherever
and
whenever
encountered
for
the
others
are
but
outgrowths
and
applications
of
them
one
warning
will
not
be
amiss
you
must
not
suppose
that
the
terms
used
in
defining
a
word
are
its
absolute
synonyms
or
may
be
substituted
for
it
indiscriminately
you
must
develop
a
feeling
for
of
the
word
so
that
you
may
perceive
where
its
likeness
to
the
other
terms
leaves
off
and
its
unlikeness
begins
thus
if
one
of
the
terms
employed
in
defining
is
you
must
not
assume
that
the
two
words
are
interchangeable
you
must
not
say
for
instance
that
the
captain
controlled
his
men
to
present
arms
such
abstractly
stated
is
the
way
to
look
up
a
word
in
the
dictionary
let
us
now
take
a
concrete
illustration
starting
with
the
word
let
us
ascertain
what
we
can
about
it
in
the
dictionary
and
our
first
quest
is
the
original
meaning
for
this
we
consult
the
bracketed
matter
there
we
meet
the
french
spanish
portuguese
and
italian
kinsmen
of
the
word
and
learn
that
they
are
traceable
to
a
common
ancestor
the
latin
n
which
comes
from
the
latin
verb
the
meaning
of
n
is
given
as
stretching
that
of
as
stretch
extend
thus
we
know
of
the
original
word
that
in
form
it
closely
resembles
the
modern
word
and
that
in
meaning
it
involves
the
idea
of
stretching
what
is
the
central
meaning
of
the
word
today
to
acquaint
ourselves
with
this
we
must
run
through
the
definitions
listed
here
in
condensed
form
they
are
the
act
of
stretching
in
stress
or
the
force
by
which
something
is
pulled
in
a
constrained
condition
of
the
particles
of
bodies
in
mental
strain
stress
or
application
a
strained
state
of
any
kind
as
political
or
social
an
attachment
to
a
for
regulating
the
strain
of
the
thread
now
of
these
definitions
and
are
too
highly
specialized
to
conduct
us
of
themselves
into
the
highway
of
the
word
meaning
they
bear
out
however
the
evidence
of
and
which
have
as
their
core
the
idea
of
stretching
or
of
the
strain
which
stretching
produces
we
must
now
lay
the
original
meaning
alongside
the
central
meaning
today
in
order
to
draw
our
conclusions
we
perceive
that
the
two
meanings
correspond
yet
by
prying
into
them
we
make
out
one
marked
difference
between
them
the
original
meaning
is
literal
the
modern
largely
figurative
to
be
sure
the
figure
has
been
so
long
used
that
it
is
now
scarcely
felt
as
a
figure
its
force
and
definiteness
have
departed
consequently
we
may
speak
of
being
on
a
tension
without
having
in
mind
at
all
a
comparison
of
our
nervous
system
with
a
stretched
garment
or
with
an
outreaching
arm
or
with
a
tightly
strung
musical
instrument
or
with
a
taut
rope
what
then
is
the
net
result
of
our
investigation
simply
this
that
means
stretching
and
that
the
stretching
may
be
conceived
either
literally
or
figuratively
with
these
two
facts
in
mind
we
need
not
unless
we
are
experts
in
mechanics
physics
statical
electricity
or
the
go
to
the
trouble
of
committing
the
special
senses
of
for

occasion
bid
we
can
from
our
position
at

a
venetian
a
garment
worn
by
venetians
and
consisting
of
breeches
and
stockings
in
one
the
second
sense
is
preserved
substantially
in
our
term
the
first
sense
led
to
the
use
of
the
word
in
the
mouths
of
the
venetians
enemies
for
buffoon
and
then
in
early
italian
comedy
for
a
lean
and
foolish
old
man
it
is
this
stock
figure
of
the
stage
that
shakespeare
evokes
in
line
means
the
covering
for
a
man
body
from
his
waist
to
his
compare
the
present
meaning
a
covering
for
the
feet
and
the
part
of
the
legs
in
line
means
absolute
in
line
means
without
of
the
words
we
have
examined
only
is
obsolete
though
and
are
perhaps
not
entirely
familiar
that
is
only
one
word
in
the
passage
so
far
as
its
outward
form
goes
is
completely
alien
to
our
knowledge
but
how
different
the
matter
stands
when
we
consider
meanings
the
words
are
words
of
today
but
the
meanings
are
the
meanings
of
shakespeare
we
should
be
baffled
and
misled
as
to
the
dramatist
thought
if
we
had
made
no
inquiries
into
the
vehicle
therefor
in
the
second
place
to
look
beyond
the
present
into
the
more
remote
signification
of
words
will
put
us
on
our
guard
against
the
reappearance
of
submerged
or
meanings
we
have
seen
that
the
word
may
be
used
without
conscious
connection
with
the
idea
of
stretching
but
if
we
incautiously
place
the
word
in
the
wrong
environment
the
idea
will
be
resurrected
to
our
undoing
we
associate
with
strong
and
eager
desire
for
ordinary
purposes
this
conception
of
the
word
suffices
but
is
one
of
the
children
of
fire
its
primary
sense
is
burning
compare
therefore
to
pronounce
the
three
vocables
overflowing
with
ardor
is
to
mix
figures
of
speech
absurdly
we
should
fall
into
a
similar
mistake
if
we
said
brilliant
fluency
and
into
a
mistake
of
another
kind
that
of
tautology
or
repetition
of
an
idea
if
we
said
cordiality
for
means
feelings
of
the
heart
means
set
a
due
value
on
we
may
perhaps
say
really
appreciate
but
scrupulous
writers
and
speakers
do
not
say
appreciate
very
much
a
compare
humid
was
once
a
moisture
then
one
of
the
four
moistures
or
liquids
that
entered
into
the
human
constitution
and
by
the
proportions
of
their
admixture
determined
human
temperament
next
a
outstanding
temperamental
quality
the
thing
itself
rather
than
the
cause
of
it
then
oddity
which
people
may
laugh
at
then
the
spirit
of
laughter
and
good
nature
in
general
normally
we
do
not
connect
the
idea
of
moisture
with
the
word
we
may
even
speak
of
a
dry
humor
but
we
should
not
say
now
and
then
a
dry
humor
crops
out
for
then
too
many
buried
meanings
lie
in
the
same
grave
for
the
very
dead
to
rest
peacefully
together
even
apart
from
reading
old
literature
and
from
having
when
you
use
words
no
ghosts
of
their
pristine
selves
rise
up
to
damn
you
you
may
profit
from
a
knowledge
of
how
the
meaning
of
a
term
has
evolved
for
example
you
will
meet
many
tokens
and
reminders
of
the
customs
and
beliefs
of
our
ancestors
thus
carries
you
back
to
the
days
when
every
court
was
amused
by
a
fool
whose
head
was
decked
with
a
cock
comb
takes
you
back
to
cockfighting
and
moonstruck
evil
star
and
thank
your
lucky
stars
plant
you
in
the
era
of
superstition
when
human
fate
was
governed
by
heavenly
bodies
further
you
will
perceive
the
poetry
of
words
thus
to
to
wag
the
tail
and
to
is
to
hurry
through
one
prayers
paternoster
what
a
picture
of
the
frailty
of
men
even
in
their
holiness
flashes
on
us
from
that
word
breakfast
the
breaking
of
the
fast
of
the
night
the
most
humdrum
of
words
is
travel
along
a
way
already
broken

an
abridged
form
of

you
is
fallen

from
its
spicy

the
the
tooth

is
a
you
will
perceive
moreover
that
many
a
dignified
word
once
involved
the
same
idea
as
some
unassuming
or
even
word
or
expression
involves
now
thus
there
is
little
or
no
difference
in
figure
between
understanding
a
thing
and
getting
on
to
it
between
averting
something
turning
it
aside
and
sidetracking
it
between
excluding
shutting
out
and
closing
the
door
to
between
degrading
putting
down
a
step
and
taking
down
a
notch
between
accumulating
heaping
up
and
making
pile
between
taking
umbrage
the
shadow
and
being
thrown
in
the
shade
between
ejaculating
and
throwing
out
a
remark
between
being
on
a
tension
and
being
highstrung
between
being
vapid
and
having
lost
steam
between
insinuating
winding
in
and
worming
in
between
investigating
and
tracking
between
instigating
goading
on
or
into
and
prodding
up
between
being
incensed

and
burning
with
indignation
between
recanting
unsinging
and
singing
another
tune
between
ruminating
chewing
and
smoking
in
one
pipe
nor
is
there
much
difference
in
figure
between
sarcasm
a
tearing
of
the
flesh
and
taking
the
hide
off
between
sinister
and
backhanded
between
preposterous

will

concrete
meanings
than
they

you
will
find
that
many
words
were
once
more
general
in
import
than
they
have
since
become
originally
meant
foolish
then
foolishly
devoted
then
becoming
more
general
again
devoted
meant
our
own
then
a
medicine
not
known
by
other
physicians
then
a
quack
remedy
meant
confirmed
in
modesty
shame
then
through
a
confusion
of
with
a
betrayal
through
the
countenance
of
or
guilt
meant
a
copy
or

then
an

duplication
especially
of

meant

of

then

meant
manliness
then
the
quality

attribute
peculiar
to
true
manhood
with
the
romans
this
was
valor
then
any
admirable
quality
then
female
chastity
meant
a

then
a

then
an
instrument
for
writing
used
in
the
same
way
as
a
quill
a
meant
a
man
then
a
stableman
in
however
it
preserves
the
old
signification
peasant
and
a
divinity
had
in
themselves
no
iniquitous
savor
until
early
christians
formed
their
opinion
of
the
people
inaccessible
to
them
and
the
spirits
incompatible
with
the
unity
of
the
godhead
words
betokening
future
happenings
or
involving
judgment
tend
to
take
a
special
cast
from
the
fears
and
anxieties
men
feel
when
their
fortune
is
affected
or
their
destiny
controlled
by
external
forces
thus
a
prophetic
utterance
or
sign
and
a
stretching
forward
a
foreseeing
a
foretelling
might
originally
be
either
benign
or
baleful
but
nowadays
especially
in
the
adjectival
forms
and
they
wear
a
menacing
hue
similarly
and
all
of
them
signifying
at
first
mere
judgment
have
come
the
first
in
popular
the
other
two
in
universal
usage
to
stand
for
adverse
judgment
the
old
sense
of
is
perpetuated
however
in
which
means
the
day
on
which
we
are
all
to
be
not
necessarily
sent
to
hell
but
judged
you
will
furthermore
perceive
that
the
exaggerated
affirmations
people
are
always
indulging
in
have
led
to
the
weakening
of
many
a
word
meant
eat
formerly
to
say
that
a
man
was
fretting
was
to
use
a
vigorous
comparison
to
have
the
man
devoured
with
care
meant
to
kill
then
killed
with
embarrassment
then
embarrassed
meant
death
but
our
qualms
of
conscience
have
degenerated
into
mere
twinges
oaths
are
shorn
of
their
might
by
overuse
once
a
tremendous
malinvocation
may
now
fall
from
the
lips
of
respectable
young
ladies
and
in
its
time
not
a
whit
less
dire
would
be
scarcely
out
of
place
in
even
a
cloister
words
designating
immediacy
come
to
have
no
more
strength
than
seven
times
boiled
meant
in
the
present
and
and
meant
forthwith
how
they
have
lost
their
fundamental
meaning
will
be
intelligible
to
you
if
you
have
in
ordering
something
been
told
that
it
would
be
delivered
right
away
or
in
calling
for
a
girl
have
been
told
that
she
would
be
down
in
a
minute
you
will
detect
in
words
of
another
class
a
deterioration
not
in
force
but
in
character
they
have
fallen
into
contemptuous
or
sinister
usage
many
words
for
skill
or
wisdom
have
been
thus
debased
meant
knowing
meant
well
acquainted
with
one
art
meant
proficient
in
one
craft
or
calling
meant
wise
man
the
present
import
of
these
words
shows
how
men
have
assumed
that
mental
superiority
must
be
yoked
with
moral
dereliction
or
diabolical
aid
words
indicating
the
generality
indicating
ordinary
rank
or
popular
affiliations
have
in
many
instances
suffered
the
same
decline

ways

might
be
heard
at
the

or
on
any
route
you
chanced
to
be
traveling

its
value
was
accordingly
slight
meant
belonging
to
the
laity
it
came
to
mean
ignorant

then
morally
reprehensible

be
used

its

the

type

individual

as

our
investigation
into
the
nature
qualities
and
fortunes
of
single
words
must
now
merge
into
a
study
of
their
family
connections
we
do
not
go
far
into
this
new
phase
of
our
researches
before
we
perceive
that
the
career
of
a
word
may
be
very
complicated
most
people
if
you
asked
them
would
tell
you
that
an
individual
word
is
a
causeless
entity
a
thing
that
was
never
begotten
and
lacks
power
to
propagate
they
would
deny
the
possibility
that
its
course
through
the
world
could
be
other
than
colorless
humdrum
now
words
thus
immaculately
conceived
and
fatefully
impotent
words
that
shamble
thus
listlessly
through
life
there
are
but
many
words
are
born
in
an
entirely
normal
way
have
a
grubby
boyhood
a
vigorous
youth
and
a
sober
maturity
marry
beget
sons
and
daughters
become
old
enfeebled
even
senile
and
suffer
neglect
if
not
death
in
their
advanced
age
they
are
exempted
by
the
discerning
from
enterprises
that
call
for
a
lusty
agility
but
are
drafted
into
service
by
those
to
whom
all
levies
are
alike
indeed
in
their
very
prime
of
manhood
their
vicissitudes
are
such
as
to
make
them
seem
human
some
rise
in
the
world
some
sink
some
start
along
the
road
of
grandeur
or
obliquity
and
then
backslide
or
reform
some
are
social
climbers
and
mingle
in
company
where
verbal
dress
coats
are
worn
some
are
social
degenerates
and
consort
with
the
ragamuffins
and
guttersnipes
of
language
some
marry
at
their
own
social
level
some
above
them
some
beneath
some
go
down
in
childless
bachelorhood
or
leave
an
unkempt
and
illegitimate
progeny
and
if
you
trace
their
own
lineage
you
will
find
for
some
that
it
is
but
decent
and
for
some
that
it
is
mongrelized
and
miscegenetic
for
some
that
it
is
proud
ancient
yea
perhaps
patriarchal
it
is
contrary
to
nature
for
a
word
as
for
a
man
to
live
the
life
of
a
hermit
through
external
compulsion
or
internal
characteristics
a
word
has
contacts
with
its
fellows
and
its
most
intimate
most
spontaneous
associations
are
normally
with
its
own
kindred
in
our
work
hitherto
we
have
had
nothing
to
say
of
verbal
consanguinity
but
we
have
not
wholly
ignored
its
existence
for
the
very
good
reason
that
we
could
not
for
example
in
the
latter
portions
of
chapter
iv
we
proceeded
on
the
hypothesis
that
at
least
some
words
have
ancestors
also
in
the
analysis
of
the
dictionary
definition
of
we
learned
that
the
word
has
not
only
a
latin
forebear
but
french
spanish
portuguese
and
italian
kinsmen
as
well
one
thing
omitted
from
that
analysis
would
have
revealed
something
further
namely
that
the
word
has
its
english
kinfolks
too
for
the
bracketed
part
of
the
dictionary
definition
mentions
two
other
english
words
and
which
from
their
origin
involve
the
same
idea
as
that
of
the
idea
of
stretching
now
words
may
be
akin
in
either
of
two
ways
they
may
be
related
in
blood
or
they
may
be
related
by
marriage
let
us
consider
these
two
kinds
of
connection
more
fully
words
related
in
blood
as
an
illustration
of
blood
kinships
enjoyed
by
a
native
english
word
take
the
adjective
we
can
easily
call
to
mind
other
members
of
its
family
goodly
goodish
humored
goods
goodness
goodliness
gospel
good
story
goodby
goodwill
goodman
goodwife
good
den
good
evening
the
good
book
the
connection
between
these
words
is
obvious
next
consider
a
group
of
words
that
have
been
naturalized
scribe
prescribe
ascribe
proscribe
transcribe
circumscribe
subscriber
indescribable
scribble
script
scripture
postscript
conscript
rescript
manuscript
nondescript
inscription
superscription
description
it
is
clear
that
these
words
are
each
other
kith
and
kin
in
blood
and
that
the
strain
or
stock
common
to
all
is
or
as
sometimes
modified
what
does
this
strain
signify
the
idea
of
writing
the
are
a
writing
clan
some
of
them
to
be
sure
have
strayed
somewhat
from
the
ancestral
calling
for
words
are
as
wilful
or
as
independent
as
men
for
example
does
not
act
like
a
member
of
the
household
of
writers
whatever
it
may
look
like
we
should
have
to
scrutinize
it
carefully
or
consult
the
record
for
it
in
that
verbal
who
who
the
dictionary
before
we
could
understand
how
it
came
by
its
scribal
affiliations
honestly
but
once
we
begin
to
reflect
or
to
probe
we
find
we
have
not
mistaken
its
identity
is
the
offspring
of
to
and
write
both
latin
terms
it
originally
meant
writing
to
a
person
name
or
after
it
that
is
imputing
to
the
person
by
means
of
written
words
some
quality
or
happening
of
which
he
was
regarded
as
the
embodiment
source
or
cause
nowadays
we
may
saddle
the
matter
on
him
through
oral
rather
than
written
speech
that
is
has
largely
lost
the
writing
traits
but
all
the
same
it
is
manifestly
of
the
writing
blood
the
are
of
undivided
racial
stock
latin
consider
now
the
or
words
which
sprang
from
the
latin
meaning
hand
here
are
some
of
them
manual
manoeuver
mandate
manacle
manicure
manciple
emancipate
manage
manner
manipulate
manufacture
manumission
manuscript
amanuensis
these
too
are
children
of
the
same
father
they
are
brothers
and
sisters
to
each
other
but
what
shall
we
say
of
legerdemain
light
or
sleight
of
hand
maintain
coup
de
main
and
the
like
they
bear
a
resemblance
to
the
and
yet
one
that
casual
observers
would
not
notice
is
there
kinship
between
the
two
sets
of
words
there
is
but
not
the
full
fraternal
or
sororal
relation
the
are
children
of
by
a
french
marriage
he
contracted
with
this
french
blood
in
their
veins
they
are
only
of
the
and
the
your
examination
of
the
family
trees
of
words
will
be
practical
rather
than
highly
scholastic
in
nature
you
need
not
track
every
word
in
the
dictionary
to
the
den
of
its
remote
parentage
nor
need
you
bother
your
head
with
the
name
of
the
distant
ancestor
but
in
the
case
of
the
large
number
of
words
that
have
a
numerous
kindred
you
should
learn
to
detect
the
inherited
strain
you
will
then
know
that
the
word
is
the
brother
or
cousin
of
certain
other
words
of
your
acquaintance
and
this
knowledge
will
apprise
you
of
qualities
in
it
with
which
you
should
reckon
to
this
extent
only
must
you
make
yourself
a
student
of
verbal
genealogy
exercise

simple
exercises
in
tracing

relationships
among

given
at
the
end

therefore
the
exercises
assigned
here
are
of
a
special
character
each
of
the
following
groups
is
made
up
of

words
but
the

is
somewhat
disguised
consult
the

for
each

learn
all
you
can

is
too
generally
overlooked
any
student
of
a
foreign
language
german
for
instance
can
recall
the
thrill
of
discovery
and
the
lift
of
reawakened
hope
that
came
to
him
when
first
he
suspected
aye
perceived
the
existence
of
verbal
matrimony
for
weeks
he
had
struggled
with
words
that
apparently
were
made
up
of
fortuitous
collocations
of
letters
then
in
some
beatific
moment
these
huddles
of
letters
took
meaning
in
instance
after
instance
they
represented
not
a
word
but
words
a
linguistic
household
let
them
be
what
they
might
a
harem
the
domestic
establishment
of
a
mormon

could
at
last
see
order
in
their

their

he
was
indifferent
absorbed
as
he
was
in
his
joy
of
understanding
in
english
likewise
are
thousands
of
these
verbal
marriages
we
may
not
be
aware
of
them
from
our
very
familiarity
with
words
we
may
overlook
the
fact
that
in
instances
uncounted
their
oneness
has
been
welded
by
a
linguistic
minister
or
justice
of
the
peace
but
to
read
a
single
page
or
harken
for
thirty
seconds
to
oral
discourse
with
our
minds
intent
on
such
states
of

relationships
hitherto
in
our
study
of
verbal
relationships
we
have
usually
started
with
the
family
having
strayed
as
by
good
luck
into
an
assembly
of
kinsmen
we
have
observed
the
common
strain
and
the
general
characteristics
and
have
then
placed
the
individual
with
reference
to
these
but
we
do
not
normally
meet
words
any
more
than
we
meet
men
in
the
domestic
circle
we
meet
them
and
greet
them
hastily
as
they
hurry
through
the
tasks
of
the
day
with
no
other
associates
about
them
than
such
as
chance
or
momentary
need
may
dictate
if
we
are
to
see
anything
of
their
family
life
it
must
be
through
effort
we
ourselves
put
forth
we
must
be
inquisitive
about
their
conjugal
and
blood
relationships
how
then
starting
with
the
individual
word
can
you
come
into
a
knowledge
of
it
not
in
its
public
capacity
but
in
what
is
even
more
important
its
personal
connections
you
must
form
the
habit
of
asking
two
questions
about
it
is
it
married
of
what
family
or
families
was
it
born
if
you
can
get
an
understanding
answer
to
these
two
questions
an
answer
that
will
tell
you
what
its
relations
stand
for
as
well
as
what
their
name
is
your
inquiries
will
be
anything
but
bootless
let
us
illustrate
your
procedure
concretely
suppose
you
read
or
hear
the
word
it
is
a
somewhat
unusual
word
but
see
what
you
can
do
with
it
yourself
before
calling
on
the
dictionary
to
help
you
observe
the
word
closely
and
you
will
obtain
the
answer
to
your
first
question
is
no
bachelor
no
verbal
old
maid
it
is
a
married
pair
your
second
and
more
difficult
task
awaits
you
you
must
ascertain
the
meaning
of
the
family
connections
with
conch
you
are
on
speaking
terms
you
know
him
as
one
of
the
shells
but
the
utmost
you
can
recall
about
his
wife
is
that
she
is
one
of
a
whole
flock
of
what
significance
does
this
relationship
possess
you
are
uncertain
but
do
not
thumb
the
dictionary
yet
pass
in
mental
review
all
the
you
can
assemble
wait
also
for
the
others
that
through
the
unconscious
operations
of
memory
will
tardily
straggle
in
be
on
the
lookout
for
as
you
read
as
you
listen
in
time
you
will
muster
a
sizable
company
of
them
and
you
will
draw
a
conclusion
as
to
the
meaning
of
the
blood
that
flows
through
their
veins
implies
speech
or
study
then
must
be
the
study
of
conches
your
investigations
thus
far
have
done
more
than
teach
you
the
meaning
of
the
word
you
began
with
they
have
brought
you
some
of
the
of
the
study
of
verbal
kinships
for
you
no
longer
pass
the
by
with
face
averted
or
bow
timidly
ventured
you
have
become
so
well
acquainted
with
them
that
even
a
new
one
wherever
encountered
would
flash
upon
you
the
face
of
a
friend
but
now
your
desires
are
whetted
you
wish
to
find
out
how
much
you
learn
you
at
last
consult
the
dictionary
here
a
huge
obstacle
confronts
you
the
like
the
above
are
a
haughty
clan
they
are
the
wooed
rather
than
the
wooing
members
of
most
marital
households
that
contain
them
now
the
marriage
licenses
recorded
in
the
dictionary
are
entered
under
the
name
of
the
suitor
not
of
the
person
sought
hence
you
labor
under
a
severe
handicap
as
you
take
the
census
of
the
let
us
imagine
the
handicap
the
most
severe
possible
let
us
suppose
that
no
had
ever
been
the
suitor
even
so
you
would
not
be
entirely
baffled
for
you
could
look
up
in
the
dictionary
the
you
your
self
had
been
able
to
recall
to
what
profit
first
you
could
verify
or
correct
your
surmise
as
to
what
the
blood
betokens
secondly
you
could
perhaps
obtain
to
yet
other
than
those
you
remembered
but
you
are
not
reduced
to
these
extremities
the
arrogant
as
they
are
sometimes
are
the
applicants
for
matrimony
and
the
marriage
registry
of
the
dictionary
so
indicates
to
be
sure
they
do
not
when
thus
appearing
at
the
beginning
of
words
take
the
form
they
take
the
form
but
you
must
be
resourceful
enough
to
keep
after
your
quarry
in
spite
of
the
omission
of
a
vowel
or
two
also
from
some
lexicons
you
may
obtain
still
further
help
you
may
find
logy
or
listed
as
a
combining
form
its
meaning
given
and
examples
of
its
use
in
compounds
cited
by
your
zeal
and
persistence
you
have
now
brought
together
a
goodly
array
of
the
all
or
most
let
us
say
of
the
following
conchology
biology
morphology
phrenology
physiology
osteology
histology
zoology
entomology
bacteriology
ornithology
pathology
psychology
cosmology
eschatology
demonology

moreover
you
may
have
perceived
in
some
of
these
words
the
kinship
which
exists
in
all
for
the
group
see
soliloquy
below
of
course
you
will
discard
some
items
from
this
list
as
being
too
learned
for
your
purposes
but
you
will
observe
of
the
others
that
once
you
know
the
meaning
of
you
are
likely
to
know
the
whole
word
thus
from
your
study
of
you
have
mastered
not
an
individual
term
but
a
tribe
in
only
one
element
was
really
dubious
at
the
outset
let
us
take
a
word
of
which
both
elements
give
you
pause
suppose
your
thought
is
arrested
by
the
word
you
perhaps
know
the
word
as
a
whole
but
not
its
components
for
by
looking
at
it
and
thinking
about
it
you
decide
that
its
state
is
married
that
it
comprises
the
household
of
eu
and
his
wife
formerly
miss
gen
but
you
can
not
say
offhand
just
what
kind
of
person
either
eu
or
the
erstwhile
miss
gen
is
likely
to
prove
have
you
met
any
of
the
elsewhere
you
think
vaguely
that
you
have
but
can
not
lay
claim
to
any
real
acquaintance
to
the
dictionary
you
accordingly
betake
yourself
there
you
find
that
eu
is
of
a
family
quite
respectable
but
not
prone
to
marriage
eupepsia
euphemism
are
of
his
retiring
kindred
the
meaning
of
the
blood
so
the
dictionary
informs
you
is
well
the
blood
as
you
see
exemplified
in
gentle
general
genital
engender
carries
with
it
the
idea
of
begetting
of
producing
of
birth
or
by
extension
of
kinship
then
is
an
alliance
of
well
and
begotten
or
born
your
immediate
purpose
is
fulfilled
but
you
resolve
let
us
say
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
more
of
the
whose
number
you
have
perceived
to
be
legion
you
are
duly
introduced
to
the
following
genus
generic
genre
gender
genitive
genius
general
gentile
gentle

primogeniture

some
of
these
are
professional
rather
than
social
you
decide
not
to
leave
your
card
at
their
doors
others
have
assumed
a
significance
somewhat
though
the
relationship
may
be
traced
if
you
are
not
averse
to
trouble
thus
in
its
superficial
aspects
seems
alien
to
the
idea
of
born
but
it
is
the
child
of
innate
inborn
is
the
inborn
power
to
accomplish
and
is
the
result
of
the
application
of
that
power
whether
you
care
to
bother
with
such
subtleties
or
not
enough
are
left
to
make
the
family
one
well
worth
your
cultivation
thus
by
studying
two
words
and
you
have
for
the
first
time
placed
yourself
on
an
intimate
footing
with
three
verbal
families
the
the
and
the
observe
that
though
you
studied
the
apart
from
the
and
the
your
knowledge
once
you
have
acquired
it
can
not
be
kept
pigeonholed
for
the
have
intermarried
with
both
the
other
families
hence
you
on
meeting
can
exclaim
how
do
you
do
eu
i
am
honored
in
making
your
acquaintance
eu
i
was
about
to
call
you
by
your
maiden
name
for
i
am
a
friend
of
your
sister
the
miss
ology
who
married
conch
and
you
too
eu
i
can
not
regard
you
as
a
stranger
i
have
looked
in
so
often
on
the
family
of
your
brother
the
euphony
family
i
mean
what
a
beautiful
literary
household
it
is
yet
it
has
been
neglected
by
the
even
by
the
people
who
write
well
the
loss
is
theirs
who
do
the
neglecting
and
you
can
greet
with
an
equal
parade
of
family
lore
trouble
to
tell
me
who
you
are
i
am
hob
and
nob
with
your
folks
on
both
sides
of
the
family
and
my
word
for
it
the
relationship
is
written
all
over
you
gen
i
envy
you
the
pride
you
must
feel
in
the
prominence
given
nowadays
to
the
household
and
it
must
delight
you
miss
that
connoisseurs
are
so
keenly
interested
in
how
are
grandfather
gen
and
grandmother
ology
they
were
keeping
up
remarkably
the
last
time
i
saw
them
do
you
think
words
will
not
respond
to
cordiality
like
this
they
will
work
their
flattered
heads
off
for
you
exercise
relationships
for
each
of
the
following
words
a
determine
what
families
are
intermarried
b
ascertain
the
exact
contribution
to
the
household
by
each
family
represented
and
c
make
as
complete
a
list
as
possible
of
cognate
words
reject
oppose
convent
defer
omit
produce
expel
test
the
extent
of
the
intermarriages
among
these
words
by
successively
attaching
each
of
the
prefixes
to
each
of
the
main
or
key
syllables
thus
etc
two
admonitions
in
tracing
verbal
kinships
you
must
be
prepared
for
slight
variations
in
the

the

perhaps
the
last
six
should
be
disregarded
as
too
exceptional
in
form
to
be
clearly
recognized
and
certainly
some
words
as
from
are
so
metamorphosed
that
they
should
be
excluded
from
practical
lists
of
this
kind
but
even
in
the
words
left
to
us
there
are
fairly
marked
divergences
in
appearance
why
because
the
has
descended
to
us
not
through
one
language
but
through
several
as
good
verbal
detectives
we
should
be
able
to
penetrate
the
consequent
disguises
for
wiz
wit
vid
and
all
embody
the
idea
of
seeing
or
knowing
on
the
other
hand
you
must
take
care
not
to
be
misled
by
a
superficial
resemblance
into
thinking
two
unrelated
identical
let
us
consider
two
sets
of
words
the

is
usually
or
that
for
the
second
tens
or
you
may
therefore
easily
confuse
the
two
groups
until
you
have
learned
to
look
past
appearances
into
meanings
thenceforth
the
holdings
and
the
stretchings
will
be
distinct
in
your
mind
will
constitute
two
great
families
not
one
of
course
individual
words
may
still
puzzle
you
you
will
not
perceive
that
for
example
belongs
with
the
stretchings
until
you
go
back
to
its
primary
idea
of
something
stretched
thin
or
that
has
membership
in
that
family
until
you
connect
it
with
the
sound
which
a
stretched
chord
emits

of

with

has
been
through

through

quality
in

which
holds
them
together

words
in

our
first
task
in
this
volume
was
the
study
of
words
in
combination
our
second
was
the
study
of
individual
words
in
two
of
their
aspects
first
as
they
are
seen
in
isolation
next
as
they
are
seen
in
verbal
families
now
our
third
task
confronts
us
it
is
the
study
of
words
as
they
are
associated
not
in
actual
blood
kinship
but
in
meaning
such
an
association
in
meaning
may
involve
only
two
words
pairs
or
larger
groups
in
this
chapter
we
shall
confine
ourselves
to
the
study
of
pairs
of
the
relationship
between
pairs
there
are
three
types
in
the
first
the
words
are
hostile
to
each
other
in
the
second
they
may
easily
be
confused
with
each
other
in
the
third
they
are
parallel
with
each
other
we
shall
examine
the
three
types
successively
but
we
must
make
an
explanation
first
although
we
shall
in
this
and
the
following
chapters
have
frequent
occasion
to
give
the
meanings
of
individual
words
we
shall
give
them
without
regard
to
dictionary
methods
we
shall
not
attempt
formal
or
exhaustive
definitions
our
purpose
is
to
convey
in
the
simplest
and
most
human
manner
possible
brief
general
explanations
of
what
the
words
stand
for
opposites
pairs
of
the
first
type
are
made
up
of
words
by
nature
opposite
to
each
other
or
else
thought
of
as
opposite
because
they
are
so
often

none
of
these

needs
explaining
if
you
think
of
one
of
them
you
will
think
of
its
opposite
at
least
its
opposite
will
be
lurking
in
the
back
of
your
mind
as
proof
of
this
fact
you
have
only
to
glance
at
the
following
list
from
which
the
second
member
of
each

is

many
words
of
a
more
difficult
kind
are
thus
pitted
against
each
other
and
we
learn
them
not
singly
but
in
pairs
at
least
we
should
as
good
verbal
hunters
we
should
be
alert
to
the
chance
of
killing
two
birds
with
one
stone
and
for
example
are
difficult
opposites
we
know
of
the
existence
of
the
two
classes
of
medical
practitioners
we
know
that
they
use
different
methods
but
beyond
this
our
knowledge
is
likely
to
be
hazy
let
us
set
out
then
to
the
two
words
the
best
way
is
to
learn
them
together
means
other
suffering
like
suffering
an
allopath
uses
remedies
which
create
within
the
patient
a
condition
that
squarely
conflicts
with
the
further
progress
of
the
disease
a
homeopath
prescribes
medicines
in
small
doses
which
produce
within
the
patient
the
same
condition
that
the
disease
would
produce
he
beats
the
disease
to
it
so
to
speak
takes
the
job
himself
and
leaves
the
disease
nothing
to
do
the
allopath
travels
around
a
in
the
opposite
direction
from
the
disease
and
thwarts
it
through
a
collision
the
homeopath
travels
around
the
in
the
same
direction
as
the
disease
and
thwarts
it
by
pulling
at
the
reins
if
we
consider
the
two
words
together
and
get
these
ideas
in
mind
we
shall
have
no
further
trouble
with
allopaths
and
homeopaths
except
perhaps
when
they
have
rendered
their
services
and
presented
their
bills
and
are
also
a
troublesome
pair
a
thing
is
objective
if
it
is
an
actual
object
or
being
if
it
exists
in
itself
rather
than
in
our
surmises
a
thing
is
subjective
if
it
is
the
creature
of
a
state
of
mind
if
it
has
its
existence
in
the
thought
or
imagination
of
some
person
or
other
thus
if
i
meet
a
bear
in
the
wilds
that
bear
is
objective
whatever
may
be
the
state
of
my
thoughts
is
and
it
would
be
to
my
advantage
to
reckon
with
this
fact
but
if
a
child
who
is
sent
off
to
bed
alone
says
there
is
a
bear
in
the
room
the
bear
is
subjective
it
is
not
a
living
monster
that
will
devour
anybody
but
a
creature
called
into
the
mind
of
the
child
through
dread
exercise

study

following

words
often
confused
pairs
of
the
second
type
are
made
up
of
words
which
are
often
confused
by
careless
writers
and
speakers
and
which
should
be
accurately
discriminated
sometimes
the
words
are
actually
akin
to
each
other
and
are
examples
sometimes
they
merely
look
or
sound
much
alike
and
are
examples
sometimes
the
things
they
designate
are
more
or
less
related
so
that
the
ideas
behind
the
words
rather
than
the
words
themselves
are
responsible
for
the
confusion
and
are
examples
let
us
distinguish
between
the
two
members
of
each
of
the
pairs
named
a
thing
is
if
it
suffers
no
interruption
whatever
if
it
is
broken
at
regular
intervals
but
as
regularly
renewed
thus
a
continuous
stretch
of
forest
the
continual
drip
of
water
from
the
eaves
pertains
to
the
moral
and
sometimes
the
social
to
the
physical
thus
the
enormity
of
the
crime
the
enormity
of
this
social
offense
the
enormousness
of
prehistoric
animals
is
often
used
reproachfully
because
of
its
supposed
relation
to
but
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
word
with
which
to
connect
it
is
conduct
thus
we
observed
how
he
demeaned
himself
implies
no
adverse
criticism
of
either
the
man
or
his
deportment
both
may
be
debased
to
be
sure
but
they
may
be
exemplary
to
means
to
feign
or
to
have
an
influence
upon
to
to
bring
to
pass
thus
he
affects
a
fondness
for
classical
music
the
little
orphan
story
affected
those
who
heard
it
we
effected
a
compromise
is
never
properly
used
as
a
noun
as
a
noun
means
result
consequence
or
practical
operation
thus
the
shot
took
instant
effect
he
put
this
idea
into
effect
a
disease
is
when
the
only
way
to
catch
it
is
through
direct
contact
with
a
person
already
having
it
or
through
contact
with
articles
such
a
person
has
used
a
disease
is
when
it
is
presumably
caused
not
by
contact
with
a
person
but
through
widespread
general
conditions

of

parallels
pairs
of
the
third
type
are
made
up
of
words
parallel
in
meaning
this
class
somewhat
overlaps
the
second
many
terms
that
are
frequently
confused
are
parallels
and
parallelism
is
of
course
a
cause
of
confusion
parallels
are
words
that
show
likeness
in
meaning
likeness
not
sameness
yet
at
one
time
actual
sameness
may
have
existed
and
in
many
instances
did
nowadays
this
sameness
has
been
lost
and
the
words
have
become
differentiated
as
a
rule
they
still
are
closely
related
in
thought
sometimes
however
the
divergence
between
them
is
wide
why
did
words
having
the
same
meaning
find
lodgment
in
the
language
in
the
first
place
the
law
of
linguistic
economy
forbids
any
such
happening
and
only
through
sheer
good
fortune
did
english
come
to
possess
duplications
the
original
did
not
contain
them
but
the
roman
catholic
clergy
brought
to
england
the
language
of
religion
and
of
scholarship
latin
later
the
normans
whose
speech
as
a
branch
of
french
was
an
offshoot
of
latin
came
to
the
island
as
conquerors
for
a
time
therefore
three
languages
existed
side
by
side
in
the
country
saxon
among
the
common
folk
latin
among
the
clergy
and
at
the
court
and
among
the
nobility
the
coalescing
of
the
three
or
of
the
two
if
we
count
latin
in
its
direct
and
indirect
contributions
as
one
was
inevitable
but
other
mostly
cognate
languages
also
had
a
part
in
the
speech
that
was
ultimately
evolved
the
element
was
augmented
by
words
from
dutch
scandinavian
and
the
germanic
tongues
in
general
and
latin
was
reinforced
by
greek
thus
to
imply
as
is
sometimes
done
that
modern
english
is
simply
a
blend
of
and
latin
elements
is
misleading
and
are
the
better
terms
to
use
provided
both
are
used
broadly
must
include
not
only
but
the
other
germanic
elements
as
well
and
must
include
french
and
greek
as
well
as
latin
the
welding
of
these
languages
made
available
two
in
some
instances
more
than
two
words
for
a
single
object
or
idea
what
became
of
these
duplicates
sometimes
one
of
the
words
was
dropped
as
needless
oftentimes
however
both
were
retained
with
such
modifications
in
meaning
that
thereafter
they
designated
not
the
same
object
or
idea
but
different
forms
or
aspects
of
it
thus
they
became
parallels
and
the
new
language
waxed
rich
with
discriminations
which
neither
of
the
component
tongues
had
possessed
scott
in
gives
the
basis
upon
which
the
unification
of
the
languages
proceeded
the
jester
wamba
in
conversation
with
the
swineherd
gurth
explains
how
the
term
took
on
the
homelier
rougher
more
workaday
uses
and
left
the
more
refined
and
fastidious
uses
for
the
a
domestic
animal
says
wamba
was
cared
for
by
the
conquered
people
and
in
consequence
bore
while
living
a
good
saxon
name
swine
ox
or
calf
but
it
was
served
at
the
tables
of
the
conquerors
and
therefore
when
ready
for
consumption
bore
a
good
name
pork
beef
or
veal
when
the
brute
a
sow
lives
and
is
in
charge
of
a
saxon
slave
she
goes
by
her
saxon
name
but
becomes
norman
and
is
called
pork
when
she
is
carried
into
the
castle
hall
to
feast
among
the
nobles
he
a
calf
is
saxon
when
he
requires
tendance
and
takes
a
norman
name
monsieur
de
veau
when
he
becomes
matter
of
enjoyment
let
us
see
how
scott
contention
fares
if
we
extend
his
list
of
terms
relative
to
animal
life
as
throughout
the
rest
of
this
chapter
with
the
single
and

a

will
show
that
at
least
as
regards
animal
life
the
native
word
is
likely
to
be
the
more
familiar
and
unpretentious
but
we
must
not
leap
to
the
conclusion
that
taking
the
language
as
a
whole
the
simple
easy
word
is
sure
to
be
native
the
abstruse

the
native

besides
being
in
itself
simpler
and
starker
than
the
classic
makes
stronger
appeal
to
our
feelings
and
affections
in
nearly
every
instance
the
objects
and
relationships
that
have
woven
themselves
into
the
very
texture
of
our
lives
are
designated
by
native

even
if
they
are
not
so
designated
solely
they
are
so
designated
in
their
more
cherished
aspects
we
warm
more
to
the
native
than
to
the

we
have
a
deeper
sentiment
for
the

for

that
the

may
be
seen
from

fact
that

language

is
likely
to
be

it

greedy

excessiveness
usually
habitual
of

or
in

figurative
uses
of

it
nearly
always
carries
the
idea
of
selfishness
denotes
intense
hunger
or
the
hasty
and
prolonged
consumption
of
great
quantities
of
food
it
may
indicate
not
habitual
selfishness
but
the

ghost
is
the
narrower
term
it
never
expresses
as
does
the
idea
of
soul
or
of
animating
mood
or
purpose
with
reference
to
incorporeal
beings
it
denotes
except
in
the
phrase
the
holy
ghost
the
reappearance
of
the
dead
in

form
may
denote
a
variety
of

nowadays
the
chief
difference
between
the
two
terms
is
that
is
the
more
used
in
poetry
in
prose
but
tends
to
express
the
more
personal
and
implacable
hostility
we
do
not
think
of
foes
as
bearing
any
friendship
for
each
other
enemies
may
or
they
may
be
enemies
in
public
affairs
but
downright
friends
in
their
private
relations
a
man
is
hardly
spoken
of
as
being
his
own
foe
but
he
may
be
his
own
enemy

the
moment
we

ourselves

truth
has
to
do
with
the
accuracy
of
the
statement
of
the
facts
with
the
intention
of
the
person
to
say
nothing
false
i
can
not
vouch
for
the
veracity
of
the
story
but
i
can
for
the
truth
of
the
teller
though
he
is
not
a
man
of

he
is

break
fracture
is
the
broader
term
it
need
not
refer
clearly
to
the
operation
or
result
of
external
force
nor
need
it
embody
the
idea
that
this
force
is
brought
against
a
hard
substance
in
these
respects
it
differs
from
as
also
in
the
fact
that
it
may
designate
a
mere
interruption
furthermore
it
has
figurative
uses
whereas
is
narrowly
literal
there
was
a
fracture
in

and
perhaps
ludicrously
to

perhaps
even
in

formal
way
the

also
means
to

how
to
acquire
synonyms
the
best
principle
for
the
extension
of
one
mastery
of
synonyms
is
the
principle
already
used
over
and
over
in
this
book
that
of
proceeding
from
the
known
to
the
unknown
it
is
the
fundamental
principle
indeed
of
any
kind
of
successful
learning
we
should
build
on
what
we
have
fit
each
new
piece
of
material
into
the
structure
already
erected
but
normally
it
is
our
ill
fortune
to
learn
through
chance
rather
than
through
system
we
perceive
elucidation
here
draw
an
inference
there
these
isolated
fragments
of
knowledge
may
mislead
rather
than
inform
us
the
principle
of
proceeding
from
the
known
to
the
unknown
may
be
applied
to
synonyms
in
various
ways
two
of
these
the
two
of
most
importance
we
must
consider
here
first
you
should
reckon
with
your
personal
demonstrated
needs
just
as
you
have
already
analyzed
your
working
vocabulary
for
its
general
limits
and
shortcomings
so
should
you
analyze
it
with
particular
reference
to
your
poverty
in
synonyms
watch
your
actual
speech
make
a
list
of
the
words
nouns
verbs
and
adjectives
particularly
that
you
employ
again
and
again
make
each
of
these
words
the
for
a
linguistic
exploring
expedition
first
write
the
word
down
then
under
it
write
all
the
synonyms
that
come
forthwith
to
your
mind
these
constitute
your
present
available
stock
in
speaking
or
writing
you
could
if
you
kept
yourself
mentally
alert
summon
them
on
the
moment
but
the
list
as
you
know
is
not
exhaustive
draw
a
line
under
it
and
subjoin
such
synonyms
as
come
to
you
after
reflection
these
constitute
a
second
stock
not
instantaneously
available
yet
to
be
tagged
as
among
your
resources
next
add
a
list
of
the
synonyms
you
find
through
research
through
a
ransacking
of
dictionaries
and
books
of
synonyms
this
third
stock
but
dimly
familiar
if
familiar
at
all
is
in
no
practical
sense
yours
and
indeed
some
of
the
words
are
too
abstruse
learned
or
technical
for
you
to
burden
your
memory
with
them
but
many
most
are
worth
acquiring
by
writing
down
the
words
of
these
three
classes
you
have
done
something
to
stamp
them
upon
your
memory
as
associates
you
must
now
make
it
your
business
to
bring
them
into
use
never
call
upon
them
for
volunteers
but
like
a
wise
commander
summon
the
individual
that
can
rightly
perform
a
particular
service
thus
will
your
speech
perhaps
vague
and
indolent
now
become
exact
discriminating
competent
vital
in
the
second
place
you
should
obtain
specific
and
detailed
command
of
general
ideas
not
of
ideas
but
of
the
great
basic
ideas
that
are
the
common
possession
of
all
mankind
for
through
these
basic
ideas
is
the
most
natural
and
profitable
approach
to
the
study
of
synonyms
each
of
them
is
represented
by
a
generic
word
so
elementary
are
idea
and
word
alike
that
a
person
can
not
have
the
one
in
mind
without
having
the
other
ready
and
on
his
tongue
every
person
is
master
of
both
but
it
is
unsafe
to
predicate
the
person
acquaintance
with
the
shades
and
phases
of
the
idea
or
with
the
corresponding
discriminations
in
language
he
may
not
know
them
at
all
he
may
know
them
partially
he
may
know
them
through
and
through
let
us
suppose
him
ignorant
of
them
but
determined
to
learn
his
progress
both
in
the
thought
and
in
the
language
will
be
from
the
general
to
the
specific
his
acquaintance
with
the
idea
in
the
large
he
will
gradually
extend
to
an
acquaintance
with
it
in
detail
and
his
command
of
the
broad
term
for
it
he
will
little
by
little
supplement
with
definite
terms
for
its
phases
an
illustration
will
make
this
clear
we
are
aware
that
the
world
is
made
up
of
various
classes
and
conditions
of
men
how
did
we
learn
this
let
us
go
back
to
the
time
when
our
minds
were
a
blank
when
we
were
babes
and
sucklings
when
we
had
not
perceived
that
men
exist
much
less
that
mankind
is
infinitely
complex
a
baby
comes
slowly
to
understand
that
all
objects
in
the
universe
are
divisible
into
two
classes
human
and
and
that
a
member
of
the
former
may
be
separated
from
the
others
and
regarded
as
an
individual
it
has
reached
the
initial
stage
of
its
knowledge
on
the
subject
it
has
the
basic
idea
that
of
the
individual
human
being
as
soon
as
it
can
speak
it
acquires
a
designating
term
not
of
course
the
sophisticated
but
the
simpler
it
uses
this
word
in
the
generic
sense
to
indicate
member
of
the
human
race
for
as
yet
it
knows
nothing
and
cares
nothing
about
differences
in
species
with
increasing
enlightenment
however
it
discerns
five
species
and
distinguishes
among
them
by
swelling
this
branch
of
its
vocabulary
to
five
words
man
in
the
sense
of
adult
male
woman
boy
girl
baby
to
be
sure
it
may
chance
to
have
acquired
a
specific
term
as
or
before
the
generic
term
but
if
so
it
has
attached
this
term
to
some
particular
individual
as
the
grocer
boy
or
itself
rather
than
to
the
individuals
of
a
species
its
understanding
of
the
species
as
a
species
comes
after
its
understanding
of
the
genus
as
time
passes
it
divides
mankind
into
yet
further
species
by
sundry
other
methods
according
to
occupation
for
example
as
doctors
chauffeurs
gardeners
to
race
or
color
as
white
men
negroes
malays
chinese
to
disposition
as
heroes
teasers
talkers
and
so
on
it
perceives
moreover
that
species
are
made
up
of
thus
instead
of
lumping
all
boys
together
it
begins
to
distinguish
them
as
big
boys
little
boys
boys
boys
in
long
trousers
boys
in
short
trousers
barefoot
boys
schoolboys
poor
boys
rich
boys
sick
boys
well
boys
friends
enemies
bullies
and
what
not
it
even
divides
the
thus
it
classifies
schoolboys
as
bright
boys
dullards
workers
shirkers
teachers
favorites
scapegoats
athletes
and
the
like
and
of
these
classes
it
may
make
yet
further
or
at
least
it
may
separate
them
into
the
individuals
that
compose
them
in
fine
with
its
growing
powers
and
experience
it
abandons
its
old
conception
that
all
persons
are
practically
alike
and
follows
human
nature
through
the
countless
ramifications
of
man
status
temperament
activities
or
fate
and
it
augments
its
vocabulary
to
keep
pace
roughly
at
least
with
its
expanding
ideas
in
thought
and
terminology
alike
its
growth
is
from
genus
to
species
so
it
is
with
all
our
ideas
and
with
all
our
words
to
cap
them
we
radiate
from
an
ascertained
center
into
new
areas
of
knowledge
we
proceed
from
the
broad
fundamental
generic
to
the
precise
discriminatory
specific
upon
this
natural
law
are
based
the
exercises
in
this
chapter
and
the
two
to
follow
the
is
always
a
word
representative
of
an
elementary
idea
a
word
and
an
idea
which
everybody
knows
the
advance
is
into
the
unknown
or
the
unused
at
any
rate
into
the
particular
now
fundamental
ideas
are
not
very
numerous
and
these
exercises
include
the
commoner
ones
such
a
method
of
studying
synonyms
must
therefore
yield
large
and
tangible
results
one
matter
however
should
be
explained
most
books
of
synonyms
start
with
a
word
and
list
all
the
terms
in
any
way
related
to
it
the
idea
of
the
compilers
is
that
the
more
they
give
the
student
the
more
they
help
him
but
oftentimes
by
giving
more
than
is
strictly
pertinent
they
actually
hinder
and
confuse
him
they
may
do
this
in
various
ways
of
which
two
must
be
mentioned
first
they
follow
an
idea
too
far
afield
thus
in
listing
the
synonyms
of
they
include
such
terms
as
and
words
only
through
stretched
usage
connected
with
secondly
they
trace
not
one
meaning
of
a
word
but
two
or
more
unrelated
meanings
when
the
word
chances
to
possess
them
thus
in
listing
the
synonyms
of
they
include
both
the
idea
of
weeping
and
the
idea
of
calling
or
screaming
what
are
the
results
of
these
methods
the
student
finds
a
clutter
where
he
expects
rationalized
order
he
finds
he
must
exclude
many
words
which
lie
in
the
borders
and
fringes
of
the
meaning
moreover
he
finds
mere
chance
associations
mingled
with
marked
kinships
in
both
cases
he
finds
dulled
distinctions
this
book
offers
synonyms
that
are
apropos
and
definite
rather
than
comprehensive
starting
with
a
basic
idea
it
finds
the
generic
term
it
then
disregards
dim
and
distant
relationships
confines
itself
rigorously
to
one
of
perhaps
two
or
three
legitimate
senses
and
refuses
to
consider
the
peculiar
twists
and
devious
ways
of
subsidiary
words
when
they
wander
from
the
idea
it
is
tracing
it
thus
deliberately
blinds
itself
to
much
that
is
interesting
but
this
partial
blindness
enables
it
to
concentrate
attention
upon
the
matter
actually
under
study
to
give
sharper
distinctions
and
surer
guidance
exercise
a
after
three
introductory
groups
dealing
with
thoroughly
concrete
ideas
and
words
the
synonyms
in
this
exercise
are
arranged
alphabetically
according
to
the
first
word
in
each
group
this
first
word
is
generic
it
is
immediately
followed
by
a
list
of
its
synonyms
these
are
then
informally
discriminated
or
else
in
a
few
instances
questions
are
asked
about
them
perhaps
a
few
less
closely
related
synonyms
are
then
listed
for
you
to
discriminate
in
a
similar
way
finally
illustrative
sentences
are
given
each
blank
in
these
you
are
to
fill
with
the
word
that
conveys
the
meaning
exactly
to
prevent
monotony
and
inattention
the
number
of
illustrative
sentences
varies

what
differences
in
human
nature
conditions
and
disposition
are
revealed
by
laughter
if
a
person
gives
audible
expression
to
mirth
gayety
or
the
simplest
word
to
apply
to
what
he
does
is
but
suppose
a
girl
with
slight
or
insufficient
provocation
engages
in
silly
or
foolish
though
perhaps
involuntary
laughter
we
should
say
she
suppose
a
youngster
is
amused
at
an
inappropriate
moment
and
but
partly
suppresses
his
laughter
or
suppose
he
wilfully
permits
the
breaking
forth
of
just
enough
laughter
to
indicate
disrespect
he
suppose
a
person
gives
a
little
light
laugh
or
more
especially
suppose
a
crowd
gives
such
an
one
as
the
result
of
slight
simultaneous
amusement
our
word
now
is
suppose
we
laugh
low
or
gently
or
to
ourselves
we
suppose
some
one
laughs
loudly
boisterously
even
coarsely
in
a
manner
befitting

lumber
camp

than
a

the

violent
irritating
sounds
the
little
dog
to
see
such
sport
the
audience
when
the
glasses
began
to
slip
from

the
girl
kept
in
a
way
that
embarrassed
us
both
the
small
boy

the

fluttered
out
of

to
the

fellows
at

a
person
simply
directs
his
eyes
to
see
he
but
eyes
may
speak
we
are
told
and
since
this
person
undergoes
many
changes
of
mood
and
purpose
we
shall
let
his
eyes
tell
us
all
they
will
about
his
different
manners
of
looking
at
first
he
but
looks
momentarily
as
from
lack
of
time
or
casually
as
from
lack
of
interest
he
soon
he
makes
a
business
of
looking
and
fastens
his
eyes
for
a
long
time
on
something
he
admires
or
wonders
at
he
presently
he
looks
with
a
blank
perhaps
a
rude
expression
and
with
eyes
opened
widely
he
may
be
for
the
moment
overcome
with
incomprehension
surprise
or
fright
or
perhaps
he
wishes
to
be
insolent
he
now
he
is
looking
narrowly
or
closely
at
something
that
he
sees
with
difficulty
he
the
next
moment
he
looks
over
something
with
care
or
with
an
encompassing
sweep
of
vision
he
it
his
interest
thoroughly
enlisted
he
looks
at
it
carefully
point
by
point
to
see
that
it
is
right
in
each
detail
he
it
he
then
alters
his
mood
and
looks
with
scornful
or
malignant
satisfaction
upon
something
he
has
conquered
or
has
power
over
he
anger
perhaps
fierceness
takes
possession
of
him
and
he
looks
with
piercing
eyes
he
threat
mingles
with
anger
and
in
all
likelihood
he
looks
scowlingly
or
frowningly
he
an
added
expression
of
sullenness
or
gloom
comes
into
his
look
he
he
throws
off
his
dark
spirit
and
looks
slyly
and
playfully
let
us
say
through
a
small
opening
he
playfulness
gives
place
to
curiosity
he
looks
quickly
and
furtively
perhaps
through
some
tiny
aperture
and
probably
at
something
he
has
no
business
to
see
he
the
while
he
looks
his
mouth
falls
open
as
from
stupidity
or
wonder
he
he
looks
at
something
a
long
time
to
study
it
he
or
his
study
is
not

itself
it
is
meditation

of

he
looks
at

with
the
effort
of

a

us
see

degrees
the
man

actively
applies
himself
to
something
whether

habitually
is
the
man
who
makes
continued
application
to
work
a
principle
or
habit
of
life
is
the
man
who
applies
himself
aggressively
to
the
accomplishment
of
some
specific
undertaking
or
pursuit
is
the
man
who
quietly
and
determinedly
sticks
to
a
task
until
it
is
accomplished
no
matter
what
its
difficulties
or
length
is
the
man
who
makes
steady
and
painstaking
application
to
whatever
he
is
about

early
in

he
acquired
habits
by
patient
and
study
you

defects
of
your

qualities

its

axiomatic
way

that
they
can
be
easily
grasped
and
remembered

unfavorably
used
the

be
filled
with

platitudes
a

the
very
the
heart
of
a
matter
it
is
sometimes
slightly
quaint
always
effective
and
arresting
a

made
in
the
manner

hated

few
words

possible

command

that

this

a

if
however
we
can
shake
off

and
exert
ourselves
in

ix
words
in
chapter
vii
you
made
a
study
of
printed
distinctions
between
synonyms
in
chapter
viii
you
were
given
lists
of
synonyms
and
made
the
distinctions
yourself
near
the
close
of
chapter
viii
you
were
given
words
and
discovered
for
yourself
what
their
synonyms
are
this
third
stage
might
seem
to
reveal
to
you
the
full
joys
and
benefits
of
your
researches
in
this
subject
certainly
to
find
a
new
word
for
an
old
one
is
an
exhilarating
sort
of
mental
travel
and
to
find
a
new
word
which
expresses
exactly
what
an
old
one
expressed
but
approximately
is
a
real
acquisition
in
living
but
you
are
not
yet
a
perfectly
trained
hunter
of
synonyms
some
miscellaneous
tasks
remain
they
will
involve
hard
work
and
call
your
utmost
powers
into
play
of
these
tasks
the
most
important
is
connected
with
the
hint
already
given
that
many
words
especially
if
they
be
generic
words
have
two
or
more
entirely
different
meanings
let
us
first
establish
this
fact
and
afterwards
see
what
bearing
it
has
on
our
study
of
synonyms
my
friend
says
i
hope
you
will
have
a
good
day
does
he
mean
an
enjoyable
one
in
general
a
profitable
or
lucrative
one
in
case
i
have
business
in
hand
a
successful
one
if
i
am
selling
stocks
or
buying
a
house
possibly
he
means
a
sunshiny
day
if
i
intend
to
play
golf
a
snowy
day
if
i
plan
to
go
hunting
a
rainy
day
if
my
crops
are
drying
up
the
ideas
here
are
varied
even
contradictory
enough
yet
may
be
used
of
every
one
of
them
is
in
truth
so
general
a
term
that
we
must
know
the
attendant
circumstances
if
we
are
to
attach
to
it
a
signification
even
approximately
accurate
this
does
not
at
all
imply
that
is
a
term
we
may
brand
as
useless
it
implies
merely
that
when
our
meaning
is
specific
we
must
set
aside
unless
circumstances
make
its
sense
unmistakable
in
favor
of
a
specific
word
is
another
very
general
term
in
let
us
wash
up
the
things
it
likely
means
dishes
or
clothes
in
hang
your
things
in
the
closet
it
likely
means
clothes
in
put
the
things
in
the
it
likely
means
tools
in
put
the
things
in
the
it
likely
means
thread
needles
and
scissors
in
the
trenches
are
swarming
with
these
things
it
likely
means
cooties
a
more
accurate
word
is
usually
desirable
yet
we
may
see
the
value
of
the
generality
in
the
saying
a
place
for
everything
and
everything
in
its
place
and
are
not
alone
in
having
multitudinous
meanings
there
are
in
the
language
numerous
words
these
words
should
be
studied
carefully
true
they
are
not
always
employed
in
ambiguous
ways
for
example
in
the
sense
of
correct
is
seldom
likely
to
be
mistaken
for
in
the
sense
of
but
a
reader
or
hearer
may
frequently
mistake
it
for
in
the
sense
of
just
or
of
honorable
in
the
use
of
such
words
therefore
we
can
not
become
too
discriminating
exercise
h
this
exercise
concerns
itself
with
common
words
that
have
more
than
one
meaning
make
your
procedure
as
follows
first
look
up
the
word
itself
under
it
you
will
find
a
number
of
defining
words
then
look
up
each
of
these
in
turn
until
you
have
the
requisite
number
and
kind
of
synonyms
the
word
is
sure
to
have
more
synonyms
than
are
called
for
you
will
have
to
use
your
dictionary
tirelessly
find
three
synonyms
for
as
applied
to
the

three
for
it
as

to

give

can
you

literal

one
of
the
most
interesting
things
to
watch
in
the
study
of
words
is
their
development
from
a
literal
to
a
figurative
application
the
first
man
who
broke
away
from
the
confines
of
the
literal
meaning
of
a
word
and
applied
the
word
to
something
that
only
in
a
figurative
sense
had
qualities
analogous
to
the
original
meaning
was
creating
poetry
he
was
making
an
imaginative
flight
comparable
in
daring
to
the
wright
brothers
first
aeronautic
flight
but
as
the
word
was
used
over
and
over
in
this
figurative
way
the
imaginative
flight
became
more
and
more
commonplace
at
last
it
ceased
to
be
imaginative
at
all
through
frequent
repetition
it
had
settled
into
the
matter
of
course
a
glance
back
at
the
group
above
will
show
you
that
with
time
the
comparison
which
was
once
the
basis
and
the
life
of
the
figurative
use
of
words
is
dulled
obscured
even
lost
as
a
further
enforcement
of
this
fact
let
us
analyze
the
word
in
its
literal
application
it
may
designate
any
surface
that
has
ridges
projections
or
inequalities
and
is
therefore
uneven
jagged
rugged
scraggy
or
scabrous
now
frequently
a
man
face
or
head
is
rough
because
unshaved
or
uncombed
also
the
fur
of
an
animal
is
rough
hence
the
term
could
be
used
for
unkempt
disheveled
shaggy
hairy
coarse
bristly
the
child
ran
its
hand
over
its
father
rough
cheek
and
the
bear
had
a
rough
coat
are
sentences
that
even
the
most
unimaginative
mind
can
understand
we
speak
of
rough
timber
because
its
surface
has
not
been
planed
or
made
smooth
we
speak
of
a
rough
diamond
because
it
is
unpolished
uncut
note
that
all
these
uses
are
literal
that
in
each
instance
some
unevenness
of
surface
is
referred
to
but
man
urged
on
by
the
desire
to
say
what
he
means
with
more
novelty
strikingness
or
force
applied
the
word
to
ideas
that
have
no
surfaces
to
be
uneven
he
imagined
what
these
ideas
would
be
like
if
they
had
surfaces
of
course
in
putting
these
conceptions
into
language
he
was
creating
figures
of
speech
some
of
them
startlingly
apt
some
of
them
merely
he
said
a
man
had
a
voice
as
though
the
voice
were
like
a
cactus
in
its
prickly
irregularities
by
he
meant
what
his
fellows
meant
when
they
spoke
of
the
voice
as
harsh
grating
jarring
discordant
inharmonious
strident
raucous
or
unmusical
going
farther
that
early
poet
said
the
weather
was
he
thought
of
clement
weather
as
being
smooth
and
even
but
of
inclement
severe
stormy
tempestuous
or
violent
weather
as
being
full
of
projections
to
rend
and
harass
one
thus
an
everyday
use
of
the
term
today
was
once
wrenched
and
immoderate
speech
possibly
the
first
man
who
heard
of
rough
weather
was
puzzled
for
a
moment
then
amused
or
delighted
as
he
caught
the
figure
it
did
not
require
great
originality
to
think
of
a
crowd
as
in
its
movements
but
our
poet
applied
the
idea
to
an
individual
to
him
a
rude
uncivil
impolite
ungracious
uncourteous
unpolished
uncouth
boorish
blunt
bluff
gruff
brusk
or
burly
person
was
as
the
unplaned
lumber
or
the
unpolished
gem
and
we
imitative
moderns
still
call
such
a
man
but
we
do
not
think
of
the
man
as
covered
with
projections
that
need
to
be
taken
off
unless
forsooth
we
receive
treatment
at
his
hands
and
note
how
far
we
have
journeyed
from
the
original
idea
of
the
word
when
we
say
i
gave
the
report
a
glance
meaning
cursory
hasty
superficial
or
incomplete
consideration
many
very
simple
words
including
several
of
those
already
treated
in
this
chapter
are
in
that
they
are
both
literal
and
figurative
exercise

trace
each
of
the
following
words

its
literal
to

of

imperfectly
understood
facts
and

thus
far
in
this
chapter
we
have
been
considering
words
we
must
now
turn
to
a
certain
class
of
facts
and
ideas
that
deserve
better
understanding
and
closer
analysis
than
we
usually
accord
them
these
facts
and
ideas
are
supposed
to
be
matters
of
common
knowledge
and
in
their
broad
scope
and
purport
they
are
because
acquaintance
with
them
is
taken
for
granted
it
behooves
us
to
know
them
yet
they
are
in
reality
complicated
and
when
we
attempt
to
deal
with
them
in
detail
our
assurance
forsakes
us
all
of
us
have
our
blind
sides
intellectually
quake
to
have
certain
areas
of
discussion
entered
because
we
foresee
that
we
must
sit
idly
by
without
power
to
make
sensible
comment
unto
as
many
as
possible
of
these
blind
sides
of
ourselves
we
should
pronounce
the
blessed
words
let
there
be
light
we
have
therefore
to
consider
certain
matters
and
topics
which
are
supposed
to
belong
to
the
common
currency
of
social
information
but
with
which
our
familiarity
is
less
thoroughgoing
than
it
should
be
what
are
these
facts
and
topics
take
for
illustration
the
subject
of
aeronautics
suppose
we
have
but
the
vaguest
conception
of
the
part
played
or
likely
to
be
played
by
aircraft
in
war
commerce
and
pleasure
suppose
we
are
not
aware
that
some
craft
are
made
to
float
and
others
to
be
driven
by
propellers
suppose
such
terms
as
zeppelin
blimp
monoplane
biplane
hydroplane
dirigible
have
no
definite
import
for
us
does
not
our
knowledge
fall
short
of
that
expected
of
men
in
this
present
age
or
take
military
terms
everybody
uses
them
clergymen
pacifists
clubmen
social
reformers
novelists
tramps
we
can
not
escape
them
if
we
would
we
ourselves
use
them
but
do
we
use
them
with
precise
and
masterly
understanding
you
call
one
civilian
colonel
and
another
major
which
have
you
paid
the
higher
compliment
you
are
uncertain
whether
a
given
officer
is
a
colonel
or
a
major
and
you
wish
to
address
him
in
such
fashion
as
will
least
offend
his
sensitiveness
as
to
rank
and
nomenclature
which
title
colonel
or
major
is
the
less
perilous
you
are
told
that
a
major
has
command
of
a
battalion
does
that
tell
you
anything
about
him
you
are
told
that
he
has
command
of
a
squadron
of
a
brigade
of
a
platoon
do
these
changes
in
circumstances
have
any
import
for
you
if
not
you
have
too
faltering
a
grasp
upon
military
facts
and
terminology
the
best
remedy
for
such
shortcomings
is
to
be
insatiably
curious
on
all
subjects
this
of
course
is
the
ideal
nobody
ever
fully
attains
it
nevertheless
exercise
m
will
set
you
to
groping
into
certain
broad
matters
relevant
to
ordinary
needs
thereafter
if
your
purpose
be
strong
enough
you
will
carry
the
same
methods
there
acquired
into
other
fields
of
knowledge
you
may
object
that
all
this
is
as
much
mental
as
linguistic
that
what
is
proposed
will
result
in
as
large
accessions
of
general
information
as
of
vocabulary
let
this
be
admitted
deficiencies
of
language
are
often
perhaps
almost
invariably
linked
with
deficiencies
of
knowledge
to
repair
the
one
we
must
at
the
same
time
repair
the
other
this
may
seem
a
hard
saying
to
those
who
seek
or
would
impart
mere
glibness
of
phrase
without
regard
for
the
substance
who
worship
words
words
words
without
thought
of
the

there
is
such
a
thing
as
froth
of
utterance
but
who
has
respect
therefor
or
is
deceived
thereby
speech
that
is
not
informed
is
like
a
house
without
a
foundation
you
should
not
desire
to
possess
it
abroad
in
this

of
ours

supplementary
list
of
words
you
have
already
mastered
many
words
but
a
glance
at
any
page
of
the
dictionary
will
convince
you
that
you
have
not
mastered
all
nor
will
you
ever
their
number
is
too
great
and
too
many
of
them
are
abstrusely
technical
nevertheless
there
remain
many
words
that
you
should
bring
into
your
vocabulary
most
of
them
are
not
extremely
usual
on
the
other
hand
they
are
not
so
unusual
that
you
would
encounter
them
but
once
in
a
lifetime
the
majority
of
them
are
familiar
to
you
perhaps
that
is
you
will
have
a
general
feeling
that
you
have
seen
them
before
but
this
is
not
enough
do
you
know
exactly
what
they
mean
can
you
when
the
occasion
comes
use
them
them
promptly
and
well
this
is
the
test
many
of
the
words
are
absolutely
new
so
far
as
this
book
is
concerned
they
have
not
been
discussed
or
attached
to
any
list
many
are
not
entirely
new
they
have
appeared
but
not
received
such
emphasis
that
they
are
sure
to
stand
fast
in
your
memory
or
some
cognate
form
of
them
may
have
been
mastered
yet
they
themselves
may
remain
unknown
thus
you
may
know
but
not
but
not
but
not
or
one
of
the
best
of
all
ways
to
extend
your
vocabulary
is
to
make
each
word
of
your
acquaintance
introduce
you
to
its
immediate
kinsmen
those
grouped
with
it
on
the
same
page
of
the
dictionary
this
chapter
puts
you
on
your
mettle
hitherto
you
have
been
given
instructions
as
to
the
way
to
proceed
now
you
must
shift
for
yourself
the
words
to
be
sure
are
corraled
for
you
but
you
must
tame
them
and
break
them
in
order
that
on
them
you
may
ride
the
ranges
of
human
intercourse
if
you
have
not
yet
learned
how
to
subdue
them
to
your
will
and
use
it
would
be
futile
to
tell
you
how
you
have
been
put
in
the
way
of
mastering
words
the
task
that
henceforth
confronts
you
is
your
own
you
must
have
at
it
unaided
it
is
true
that
in
the
exercise
that
follows
specific
help
is
given
you
on
a
limited
number
of
the
words
but
this
help
is
only
toward
discovering
the
words
for
yourself
before
you
have
seen
them
in
a
list
and
for
most
of
the
words
not
even
this
meager
assistance
is
given
exercise
supplementary
each
of
the
following
groups
of
words
is
preceded
by
sentences
in
which
blanks
should
be
filled
by
words
from
that
group
but
do
your
best
to
fill
these
blanks
properly
before
you
consult
the
group
at
all
you
must
learn
to
think
of
or
think
up
the
right
word
instead
of
having
it
pointed
out
to
you

xi
retrospect
do
you
never
while
occupying
a
dental
chair
and
deploring
the
necessity
that
drives
you
to
that
uncomfortable
seat
admire
the
skill
of
the
dentist
in
the
use
of
his
instruments
a
great
many
of
these
instruments
lie
at
his
hand
to
you
they
appear
bewildering
so
slightly
different
are
they
from
each
other
yet
with
unerring
readiness
the
dentist
lays
hold
of
the
one
he
needs
now
this
facility
of
his
is
not
a
blessing
with
which
a
gracious
heaven
endowed
him
it
is
the
consequence
and
reward
of
hard
study
and
above
all
of
work
hard
work
you
have
been
ambitious
of
like
skill
in
the
manipulation
of
words
had
you
not
been
you
would
never
have
undertaken
this
study
you
have
perceived
that
when
you
speak
or
write
words
are
your
instruments
you
have
wished
to
learn
how
to
use
them
now
for
every
idea
you
shall
ever
have
occasion
to
express
await
throngs
of
vocables
each
presenting
its
claims
as
a
fit
medium
these
you
must
pass
in
instantaneous
review
these
you
must
expertly
appraise
out
of
these
you
must
choose
the
words
that
will
best
serve
your
purpose
with
practice
you
will
make
your
selections
unconsciously
you
will
never
of
course
quite
attain
the
infallibility
of
the
dentist
for
linguistic
instruments
are
more
numerous
than
dental
and
far
more
complex
but
you
will
more
and
more
nearly
approximate
the
ideal
will
more
and
more
nearly
find
that
right
expression
has
become
second
nature
with
you
all
this
is
conditioned
upon
labor
faithful
and
steadfast
without
labor
you
will
never
be
adept
at
the
outset
of
our
study
together
we
warned
you
that
though
we
should
gather
the
material
and
point
the
way
you
yourself
must
do
the
work
this
book
is
not
one
to
glance
through
it
is
one
to
dwell
with
to
toil
with
it
exacts
much
of
you
makes
you
for
each
page
you
turn
pay
with
the
sweat
of
your
brain
but
assuming
that
you
have
done
your
part
what
have
you
gained
without
answering
this
question
at
all
fully
we
may
at
this
juncture
engage
in
a
brief
retrospect
first
of
all
you
have
rid
yourself
of
the
notion
that
words
are
dead
things
unrealities
worthy
of
no
more
than
wooden
and
mechanical
employment
as
much
as
anything
else
in
the
world
words
are
alive
and
responsive
are
fraught
with
unmeasured
possibilities
of
good
or
you
have
taken
due
cognizance
of
the
fact
that
words
must
be
considered
in
the
aggregate
as
well
as
individually
and
have
reckoned
with
the
pitfalls
and
dangers
as
well
as
with
the
advantages
of
their
use
in
combination
but
the
basis
of
everything
is
a
keener
knowledge
of
words
severally
you
have
therefore
come
to
study
words
with
the
zest
and
insight
you
exhibit
or
should
exhibit
in
studying
men
incidentally
you
have
acquired
the
habit
of
looking
up
dictionary
definitions
not
merely
to
satisfy
a
present
need
but
also
to
add
permanently
to
your
linguistic
resources
you
have
carried
the
study
of
individuals
farther
you
have
come
to
know
words
inside
and
out
such
knowledge
not
only
assists
you
in
your
dealings
with
your
contemporaries
it
illuminates
for
you
great
literature
of
the
past
that
otherwise
would
remain
obscure
how
much
keener
for
example
is
your
understanding
of
shakespeare
passage
on
the
seven
ages
of
man
because
of
your
thorough
acquaintance
with
the
single
word
how
quickly
does
the
awe
for
big
words
slip
from
you
when
you
perceive
that
is
in
origin
the
equivalent
of
what
intimacy
of
insight
into
words
you
feel
when
you
find
that
a
is
a
of
one
what
a
linking
of
language
with
life
you
discover
when
you
learn
the
original
signification
of
of
of
of
of
and
what
revelations
as
into
a
mystic
fraternalism
with
words
do
you
obtain
when
you
confront
such
a
phrase
as
the
bank
or
cut
to
the
not
only
have
words
become
more
like
living
beings
to
you
you
have
learned
to
think
of
them
in
relations
analogous
to
the
human
you
can
detect
the
blood
kinship
for
example
between
and
and
know
that
the
strain
of
or
or
in
a
word
is
pretty
sure
to
betoken
making
or
doing
you
know
that
there
are
elaborate
intermarriages
among
words
you
recognize
for
example
as
a
married
couple
you
even
have
confidential
word
as
to
the
dowry
brought
by
each
of
the
contracting
parties
to
the
new
verbal
household
you
have
discovered
further
that
the
language
actually
swarms
with
pairs
words
joined
with
each
other
not
in
blood
or
by
marriage
but
through
meaning
you
have
so
familiarized
yourself
with
hundreds
of
these
pairs
that
to
think
of
one
word
is
to
call
the
other
to
mind
finally
and
in
many
respects
most
important
of
all
you
have
acquired
a
vast
stock
of
synonyms
you
have
had
it
brought
to
your
attention
that
the
number
of
basic
ideas
in
the
world
is
surprisingly
small
that
for
each
of
these
ideas
there
is
in
our
language
one
generic
word
that
most
people
use
this
one
word
constantly
instead
of
seeking
the
subsidiary
term
that
expresses
a
particular
phase
of
the
idea
and
that
you
as
a
builder
of
your
vocabulary
must
while
holding
fast
to
the
basic
idea
with
one
hand
reach
out
with
the
other
for
the
fit
sure
material
of
specific
words
nor
have
you
rested
in
the
mere
perception
of
theory
you
have
had
abundant
practice
have
yourself
covered
the
ground
foot
by
foot
you
can
therefore
proceed
with
reasonable
freedom
from
the
commoner
ideas
of
the
human
mind
to
that
expression
of
definite
aspects
of
them
which
is
anything
but
common
you
have
not
of
course
achieved
perfection
there
still
is
much
for
you
to
do
there
always
will
be
nevertheless
in
the
ways
just
reviewed
and
in
various
other
ways
not
mentioned
in
this
chapter
you
have
made
yourself
verbally
rich
you
are
one
of
the
millionaires
of
language
when
you
speak
it
is
not
with
stammering
incompetence
but
with
confident
readiness
when
you
write
it
is
with
energy
and
assurance
in
the
very
flow
of
the
ink
where
you
had
long
been
a
slave
you
have
become
a
freeman
and
can
look
your
fellows
in
the
eye
you
have
the
best
badge
of
culture
a
human
being
can
possess
you
have
power
at
your
tongue
end
you
have
the
proud
satisfaction
of
having
wrought
well
and
the
inspiration
of
knowing
that
whatever
verbal
need
may
arise
you
are
trained
and
equipped
to
grapple
with
it
triumphantly
appendices
the
drift
of
our
rural
population
cityward
an
editorial
to
an
individual
who
from
whatever
motives
of
personal
advantage
or
mere
curiosity
has
made
himself
an
observer
of
current
tendencies
the
drift
of
our
rural
population
cityward
gives
food
for
serious
reflection
this
drift
is
one
of
the
most
pronounced
of
the
social
and
economic
phenomena
of
the
day
its
consequences
upon
the
life
welfare
and
future
of
the
great
nation
to
which
we
are
proud
to
acknowledge
our
allegiance
are
matters
of
such
paramount
importance
to
all
concerned
that
we
should
turn
aside
more
often
than
we
do
from
the
distracting
exactions
of
our
ordinary
activities
to
give
them
prolonged
and
earnest
consideration
a
generation
or
so
ago
human
beings
were
content
to
spend
the
full
term
of
their
earthly
existence
amid
rural
surroundings
or
if
in
their
declining
days
they
longed
for
more
of
the
comforts
and
associations
which
are
among
the
cravings
of
mortality
it
was
an
easy
proposition
to
move
to
the
nearest
village
or
if
they
were
too
high
and
mighty
for
this
simple
measure
to
satisfy
them
they
could
indulge
in
the
more
grandiose
performance
of
residing
in
the
county
seat
but
nowadays
our
people
want
more
rich
or
poor
tall
or
dumpy
tottering
grandmothers
or
babies
in
they
long
for
ampler
pastures
their
brawny
arms
or
hoary
heads
must
bedeck
nothing
less
than
the
metropolis
itself
and
perchance
put
shoulders
to
the
wheel
in
the
incessant
grind
of
the
urban
treadmill
can
you
beat
it
unquestioned
profit
does
not
attend
the
migration
it
stands
to
reason
that
some
of
the
very
advantages
sought
have
been
sacrificed
on
the
altar
of
the
drift
cityward
let
us
say
you
have
your
individual
domicile
or
the
cramped
and
sunless
apartment
you
dub
your
habitation
within
corporate
limits
does
that
mean
that
the
privileges
of
the
city
are
at
your
disposal
so
that
you
have
merely
to
reach
forth
your
hand
and
pluck
them
well
hardly
you
certainly
do
not
reside
in
the
downtown
section
or
if
you
do
you
wish
to
heaven
you
did
and
you
can
reach
this
section
only
with
delay
and
inconvenience
whether
in
the
hours
of
business
or
in
the
subsequent
period
devoted
to
the
glitter
of
nocturnal
revelry
and
amusement
but
whatever
the
disadvantages
of
the
city
the
people
who
endure
them
are
convinced
that
to
go
back
to
the
vines
and
figtrees
of
their
native
heath
would
be
jumping
out
of
the
frying
pan
into
the
fire
why
well
for
one
thing
there
is
no
such
thing
as
leisure
in
the
areas
that
lie
beyond
those
vast
aggregations
of
humanity
which
constitute
our
cities
not
only
are
there
innumerable
and
seemingly
interminable
chores
that
must
follow
the
regular
occupations
of
the
day
but
a
thousand
emergencies
due
to
chance
weather
or
the
natural
cussedness
of
things
must
be
disposed
of
as
they
arise
regardless
of
what
plans
the
rustic
swain
cherishes
for
the
use
of
his
spare
time
urban
laborers
have
contrived
by
one
means
or
another
to
bring
about
a
limitation
of
the
number
of
hours
per
diem
they
are
forced
to
toil
to
the
farmers
such
an
alleviation
of
their
hardships
is
not
within
the
realm
of
practicability
they
kick
about
it
of
course
they
say
it
a
blooming
nuisance
but
neither
their
heartburnings
nor
their
struggles
can
efface
it
as
a
fact
again
the
means
of
entertainment
are
more
limited
and
that
by
a
big
lot
with
the
farmer
than
with
those
who
dwell
in
the
cities
it
is
all
very
well
to
talk
about
the
blessings
of
the
rural
telephone
rural
free
delivery
and
the
automobile
these
things
do
make
communication
easier
than
it
used
to
be
but
after
all
they
only
a
drop
in
the
bucket
and
do
little
to
stop
the
drift
cityward
we
may
remark
just
here
that
if
you
live
a
thousand
miles
from
nowhere
and
are
willing
to
drive
your
tin
lizzie
into
town
for
the
advantages
you
are
likely
to
get
much
even
along
the
line
of
the
movies
and
you
get
less
still
if
what
after
is
an
school
for
your
progeny
finally
the
widespread
impression
that
the
farmer
is
a
bloated
and
unscrupulous
profiteer
has
done
much
to
disgust
him
with
his
station
and
employment
in
life
we
do
say
he
the
one
and
only
when
it
comes
to
the
virtues
maybe
he
has
sprouted
any
wings
yet
what
if
he
has
the
cities
with
their
brothels
their
big
business
and
their
municipal
governments
you
would
have
the
face
to
say
that
there
anything
wrong
with
them
now
would
you
oh
no
of
course
not
the
farmer
pays
high
for
his
machinery
and
goes
clear
to
the
bottom
of
his
pocketbook
when
he
has
to
buy
shoes
or
a
sack
of
flour
but
let
him
have
a
steer
hide
or
a
wagon
load
of
wheat
to
sell
and
it
somebody
else
ox
that
gored
consumers
pay
big
prices
for
farm
products
goodness
knows
but
they
pay
them
to
the
farmer
not
on
your
tintype
the
middleman
gets
his
you
need
question
that
we
beg
pardon
a
thousand
times
we
mean
the
there
no
end
to
those
human
parasites
and
so
farmer
after
farmer
breaks
up
the
old
homestead
and
contributes
his
mite
to
the
drift
cityward
what
will
be
the
result
that
comes
out
of
it
all
the
effect
upon
the
farmer
deserves
an
editorial
all
to
itself
here
we
must
limit
ourselves
to
the
effects
on
the
future
of
our
beloved
american
nation
and
even
these
we
can
now
do
no
more
than
mention
we
lack
space
to
elaborate
them
one
effect
if
the
tendency
continues
will
be
such
a
reduction
in
foodstuffs
that
we
shall
have
to
import
from
other
countries
lying
abroad
a
good
portion
of
the
means
of
our
physical
sustenance
and
shall
face
such
an
increase
in
the
cost
of
the
same
that
thousands
and
thousands
of
our
people
will
find
it
increasingly
harder
as
the
years
pass
by
to
maintain
their
relative
economic
position
another
effect
will
be
that
our
civilization
which
to
this
point
has
sprawled
over
broad
acres
will
become
an
urban
civilization
penned
in
amid
conditions
restraints
privations
and
perhaps
also
opportunities
unprecedented
in
our
past
history
and
unknown
to
the
experience
we
have
had
hitherto
a
final
effect
will
be
that
our
most
conservative
class
the
rural
populace
will
no
longer
present
resistance
that
is
formidable
to
the
innovations
which
those
who
hold
extreme
views
are
forever
exhorting
us
to
embrace
and
the
result
may
well
be
that
the
disintegration
of
this
staying
and
stabilizing
element
in
our
citizenship
one
that
retards
and
mollifies
if
it
does
not
inhibit
change
will
produce
consequences
in
its
train
which
may
be
as
dire
as
they
are
difficult
to
foretell
causes
for
the
american
spirit
of
liberty
from
the
on
conciliation
with
the
by
edmund
burke
in
this
character
of
the
americans
a
love
of
freedom
is
the
predominating
feature
which
marks
and
distinguishes
the
whole
and
as
an
ardent
is
always
a
jealous
affection
your
colonies
become
suspicious
restive
and
untractable
whenever
they
see
the
least
attempt
to
wrest
from
them
by
force
or
shuffle
from
them
by
chicane
what
they
think
the
only
advantage
worth
living
for
this
fierce
spirit
of
liberty
is
stronger
in
the
english
colonies
probably
than
in
any
other
people
of
the
earth
and
this
from
a
great
variety
of
powerful
causes
which
to
understand
the
true
temper
of
their
minds
and
the
direction
which
this
spirit
takes
it
will
not
be
amiss
to
lay
open
somewhat
more
largely
first
the
people
of
the
colonies
are
descendants
of
englishmen
england
sir
is
a
nation
which
still
i
hope
respects
and
formerly
adored
her
freedom
the
colonists
emigrated
from
you
when
this
part
of
your
character
was
most
predominant
and
they
took
this
bias
and
direction
the
moment
they
parted
from
your
hands
they
are
therefore
not
only
devoted
to
liherty
but
to
liberty
according
to
english
ideas
and
on
english
principles
abstract
liberty
like
other
mere
abstractions
is
not
to
be
found
liberty
inheres
in
some
sensible
object
and
every
nation
has
formed
to
itself
some
favorite
point
which
by
way
of
eminence
becomes
the
criterion
of
their
happiness
it
happened
you
know
sir
that
the
great
contests
for
freedom
in
this
country
were
from
the
earliest
times
chiefly
upon
the
question
of
taxing
most
of
the
contests
in
the
ancient
commonwealths
turned
primarily
on
the
right
of
election
of
magistrates
or
on
the
balance
among
the
several
orders
of
the
state
the
question
of
money
was
not
with
them
so
immediate
but
in
england
it
was
otherwise
on
this
point
of
taxes
the
ablest
pens
and
most
eloquent
tongues
have
been
exercised
the
greatest
spirits
have
acted
and
suffered
in
order
to
give
the
fullest
satisfaction
concerning
the
importance
of
this
point
it
was
not
only
necessary
for
those
who
in
argument
defended
the
excellence
of
the
english
constitution
to
insist
on
this
privilege
of
granting
money
as
a
dry
point
of
fact
and
to
prove
that
the
right
had
been
acknowledged
in
ancient
parchments
and
blind
usages
to
reside
in
a
certain
body
called
a
house
of
commons
they
went
much
farther
they
attempted
to
prove
and
they
succeeded
that
in
theory
it
ought
to
be
so
from
the
particular
nature
of
a
house
of
commons
as
an
immediate
representative
of
the
people
whether
the
old
records
had
delivered
this
oracle
or
not
they
took
infinite
pains
to
inculcate
as
a
fundamental
principle
that
in
all
monarchies
the
people
must
in
effect
themselves
mediately
or
immediately
possess
the
power
of
granting
their
own
money
or
no
shadow
of
liberty
can
subsist
the
colonies
draw
from
you
as
with
their
these
ideas
and
principles
their
love
of
liberty
as
with
you
fixed
and
attached
on
this
specific
point
of
taxing
liberty
might
be
safe
or
might
be
endangered
in
twenty
other
particulars
without
their
being
much
pleased
or
alarmed
here
they
felt
its
pulse
and
as
they
found
that
beat
they
thought
themselves
sick
or
sound
i
do
not
say
whether
they
were
right
or
wrong
in
applying
your
general
arguments
to
their
own
case
it
is
not
easy
indeed
to
make
a
monopoly
of
theorems
and
corollaries
the
fact
is
that
they
did
thus
apply
those
general
arguments
and
your
mode
of
governing
them
whether
through
lenity
or
indolence
through
wisdom
or
mistake
confirmed
them
in
the
imagination
that
they
as
well
as
you
had
an
interest
in
these
common
principles
they
were
further
confirmed
in
this
pleasing
error
by
the
form
of
their
provincial
legislative
assemblies
their
governments
are
popular
in
an
high
degree
some
are
merely
popular
in
all
the
popular
representative
is
the
most
weighty
and
this
share
of
the
people
in
their
ordinary
government
never
fails
to
inspire
them
with
lofty
sentiments
and
with
a
strong
aversion
from
whatever
tends
to
deprive
them
of
their
chief
importance
if
anything
were
wanting
to
this
necessary
operation
of
the
form
of
government
religion
would
have
given
it
a
complete
effect
religion
always
a
principle
of
energy
in
this
new
people
is
no
way
worn
out
or
impaired
and
their
mode
of
professing
it
is
also
one
main
cause
of
this
free
spirit
the
people
are
protestants
and
of
that
kind
which
is
the
most
adverse
to
all
implicit
submission
of
mind
and
opinion
this
is
a
persuasion
not
only
favorable
to
liberty
but
built
upon
it
i
do
not
think
sir
that
the
reason
of
this
averseness
in
the
dissenting
churches
from
all
that
looks
like
absolute
government
is
so
much
to
be
sought
in
their
religious
tenets
as
in
their
history
every
one
knows
that
the
roman
catholic
religion
is
at
least
coeval
with
most
of
the
governments
where
it
prevails
that
it
has
generally
gone
hand
in
hand
with
them
and
received
great
favor
and
every
kind
of
support
from
authority
the
church
of
england
too
was
formed
from
her
cradle
under
the
nursing
care
of
regular
government
but
the
dissenting
interests
have
sprung
up
in
direct
opposition
to
all
the
ordinary
powers
of
the
world
and
could
justify
that
opposition
only
on
a
strong
claim
to
natural
liberty
their
very
existence
depended
on
the
powerful
and
unremitted
assertion
of
that
claim
all
protestantism
even
the
most
cold
and
passive
is
a
sort
of
dissent
but
the
religion
most
prevalent
in
our
northern
colonies
is
a
refinement
on
the
principle
of
resistance
it
is
the
dissidence
of
dissent
and
the
protestantism
of
the
protestant
religion
this
religion
under
a
variety
of
denominations
agreeing
in
nothing
but
in
the
communion
of
the
spirit
of
liberty
is
predominant
in
most
of
the
northern
provinces
where
the
church
of
england
notwithstanding
its
legal
rights
is
in
reality
no
more
than
a
sort
of
private
sect
not
composing
most
probably
the
tenth
of
the
people
the
colonists
left
england
when
this
spirit
was
high
and
in
the
emigrants
was
the
highest
of
all
and
even
that
stream
of
foreigners
which
has
been
constantly
flowing
into
these
colonies
has
for
the
greatest
part
been
composed
of
dissenters
from
the
establishments
of
their
several
countries
who
have
brought
with
them
a
temper
and
character
far
from
alien
to
that
of
the
people
with
whom
they
mixed
sir
i
can
perceive
by
their
manner
that
some
gentlemen
object
to
the
latitude
of
this
description
because
in
the
southern
colonies
the
church
of
england
forms
a
large
body
and
has
a
regular
establishment
it
is
certainly
true
there
is
however
a
circumstance
attending
these
colonies
which
in
my
opinion
fully
counterbalances
this
difference
and
makes
the
spirit
of
liberty
still
more
high
and
haughty
than
in
those
to
the
northward
it
is
that
in
virginia
and
the
carolinas
they
have
a
vast
multitude
of
slaves
where
this
is
the
case
in
any
part
of
the
world
those
who
are
free
are
by
far
the
most
proud
and
jealous
of
their
freedom
freedom
is
to
them
not
only
an
enjoyment
but
a
kind
of
rank
and
privilege
not
seeing
there
that
freedom
as
in
countries
where
it
is
a
common
blessing
and
as
broad
and
general
as
the
air
may
be
united
with
much
abject
toil
with
great
misery
with
all
the
exterior
of
servitude
liberty
looks
amongst
them
like
something
that
is
more
noble
and
liberal
i
do
not
mean
sir
to
commend
the
superior
morality
of
this
sentiment
which
has
at
least
as
much
pride
as
virtue
in
it
but
i
can
not
alter
the
nature
of
man
the
fact
is
so
and
these
people
of
the
southern
colonies
are
much
more
strongly
and
with
an
higher
and
more
stubborn
spirit
attached
to
liberty
than
those
to
the
northward
such
were
all
the
ancient
commonwealths
such
were
our
gothic
ancestors
such
in
our
days
were
the
poles
and
such
will
be
all
masters
of
slaves
who
are
not
slaves
themselves
in
such
a
people
the
haughtiness
of
domination
combines
with
the
spirit
of
freedom
fortifies
it
and
renders
it
invincible
permit
me
sir
to
add
another
circumstance
in
our
colonies
which
contributes
no
mean
part
towards
the
growth
and
effect
of
this
untractable
spirit
i
mean
their
education
in
no
country
perhaps
in
the
world
is
the
law
so
general
a
study
the
profession
itself
is
numerous
and
powerful
and
in
most
provinces
it
takes
the
lead
the
greater
number
of
the
deputies
sent
to
the
congress
were
lawyers
but
all
who
read
and
most
do
read
endeavor
to
obtain
some
smattering
in
that
science
i
have
been
told
by
an
eminent
bookseller
that
in
no
branch
of
his
business
after
tracts
of
popular
devotion
were
so
many
books
as
those
on
the
law
exported
to
the
plantations
the
colonists
have
now
fallen
into
the
way
of
printing
them
for
their
own
use
i
hear
that
they
have
sold
nearly
as
many
of
blackstone
commentaries
in
america
as
in
england
general
gage
marks
out
this
disposition
very
particularly
in
a
letter
on
your
table
he
states
that
all
the
people
in
his
government
are
lawyers
or
smatterers
in
law
and
that
in
boston
they
have
been
enabled
by
successful
chicane
wholly
to
evade
many
parts
of
one
of
your
capital
penal
constitutions
the
smartness
of
debate
will
say
that
this
knowledge
ought
to
teach
them
more
clearly
the
rights
of
legislature
their
obligations
to
obedience
and
the
penalties
of
rebellion
all
this
is
mighty
well
but
my
honorable
and
learned
friend
on
the
floor
who
condescends
to
mark
what
i
say
for
animadversion
will
disdain
that
ground
he
has
heard
as
well
as
i
that
when
great
honors
and
great
emoluments
do
not
win
over
this
knowledge
to
the
service
of
the
state
it
is
a
formidable
adversary
to
government
if
the
spirit
be
not
tamed
and
broken
by
these
happy
methods
it
is
stubborn
and
litigious
studia
in
this
study
renders
men
acute
inquisitive
dexterous
prompt
in
attack
ready
in
defence
full
of
resources
in
other
countries
the
people
more
simple
and
of
a
less
mercurial
cast
judge
of
an
ill
principle
in
government
only
by
an
actual
grievance
here
they
anticipate
the
evil
and
judge
of
the
pressure
of
the
grievance
by
the
badness
of
the
principle
they
augur
misgovernment
at
a
distance
and
snuff
the
approach
of
tyranny
in
every
tainted
breeze
the
last
cause
of
this
disobedient
spirit
in
the
colonies
is
hardly
less
powerful
than
the
rest
as
it
is
not
merely
moral
but
laid
deep
in
the
natural
constitution
of
things
three
thousand
miles
of
ocean
lie
between
you
and
them
no
contrivance
can
prevent
the
effect
of
this
distance
in
weakening
government
seas
roll
and
months
pass
between
the
order
and
the
execution
and
the
want
of
a
speedy
explanation
of
a
single
point
is
enough
to
defeat
a
whole
system
you
have
indeed
winged
ministers
of
vengeance
who
carry
your
bolts
in
their
pounces
to
the
remotest
verge
of
the
sea
but
there
a
power
steps
in
that
limits
the
arrogance
of
raging
passions
and
furious
elements
and
says
far
shalt
thou
go
and
no
who
are
you
that
you
should
fret
and
rage
and
bite
the
chains
of
nature
nothing
worse
happens
to
you
than
does
to
all
nations
who
have
extensive
empire
and
it
happens
in
all
the
forms
into
which
empire
can
be
thrown
in
large
bodies
the
circulation
of
power
must
be
less
vigorous
at
the
extremities
nature
has
said
it
the
turk
can
not
govern
egypt
and
arabia
and
kurdistan
as
he
governs
thrace
nor
has
he
the
same
dominion
in
crimea
and
algiers
which
he
has
at
brusa
and
smyrna
despotism
itself
is
obliged
to
truck
and
huckster
the
sultan
gets
such
obedience
as
he
can
he
governs
with
a
loose
rein
that
he
may
govern
at
all
and
the
whole
of
the
force
and
vigor
of
his
authority
in
his
center
is
derived
from
a
prudent
relaxation
in
all
his
borders
spain
in
her
provinces
is
perhaps
not
so
well
obeyed
as
you
are
in
yours
she
complies
too
she
submits
she
watches
times
this
is
the
immutable
condition
the
eternal
law
of
extensive
and
detached
empire
then
sir
from
these
six
capital
sources
of
descent
of
form
of
government
of
religion
in
the
northern
provinces
of
manners
in
the
southern
of
education
of
the
remoteness
of
situation
from
the
first
mover
of
all
these
causes
a
fierce
spirit
of
liberty
has
grown
up
it
has
grown
with
the
growth
of
the
people
in
your
colonies
and
increased
with
the
increase
of
their
wealth
a
spirit
that
unhappily
meeting
with
an
exercise
of
power
in
england
which
however
lawful
is
not
reconcilable
to
any
ideas
of
liberty
much
less
with
theirs
has
kindled
this
flame
that
is
ready
to
consume
us
parable
of
the
sower
matthew
and
and
he
spake
many
things
unto
them
in
parables
saying
behold
a
sower
went
forth
to
sow
and
when
he
sowed
some
seeds
fell
by
the
way
side
and
the
fowls
came
and
devoured
them
up
some
fell
upon
stony
places
where
they
had
not
much
earth
and
forthwith
they
sprung
up
because
they
had
no
deepness
of
earth
and
when
the
sun
was
up
they
were
scorched
and
because
they
had
no
root
they
withered
away
and
some
fell
among
thorns
and
the
thorns
sprung
up
and
choked
them
but
other
fell
into
good
ground
and
brought
forth
fruit
some
an
hundredfold
some
sixtyfold
some
thirtyfold
hear
ye
therefore
the
parable
of
the
sower
when
any
one
heareth
the
word
of
the
kingdom
and
understandeth
it
not
then
cometh
the
wicked
one
and
catcheth
away
that
which
was
sown
in
his
heart
this
is
he
which
received
seed
by
the
way
side
but
he
that
received
the
seed
into
stony
places
the
same
is
he
that
heareth
the
word
and
anon
with
joy
receiveth
it
yet
he
hath
not
root
in
himself
but
dureth
for
a
while
for
when
tribulation
or
persecution
ariseth
because
of
the
word
by
and
by
he
is
offended
he
also
that
received
seed
among
the
thorns
is
he
that
heareth
the
word
and
the
care
of
this
world
and
the
deceitfulness
of
riches
choke
the
word
and
he
becometh
unfruitful
but
he
that
received
seed
into
the
good
ground
is
he
that
heareth
the
word
and
understandeth
it
which
also
beareth
fruit

all
the

a
stage
and
all
the
men
and
women
merely
players
they
have
their
exits
and
their
entrances
and
one
man
in
his
time
plays
many
parts
his
acts
being
seven
ages
at
first
the
infant
mewling
and
puking
in
the
nurse
arms
and
then
the
whining
with
his
satchel
and
shining
morning
face
creeping
like
snail
unwillingly
to
school
and
then
the
lover
sighing
like
furnace
with
a
woful
ballad
made
to
his
mistress
eyebrow
then
a
soldier
full
of
strange
oaths
and
bearded
like
the
pard
jealous
in
honor
sudden
and
quick
in
quarrel
seeking
the
bubble
reputation
even
in
the
cannon
mouth
and
then
the
justice
in
fair
round
belly
with
good
capon
lin
with
eyes
severe
and
beard
of
formal
cut
full
of
wise
saws
and
modern
instances

so
he

part

sixth
age
shifts
into
the
lean
and
slipper
pantaloon
with
spectacles
on
nose
and
pouch
on
side
his
youthful
hose
well
say
a
world
too
wide
for
his
shrunk
shank
and
his
big
manly
voice
turning
again
toward
childish
treble
pipes
and
whistles
in
his
sound
last
scene
of
all
that
ends
this
strange
eventful
history
is
second
childishness
and
mere
oblivion
sans
teeth
sans
eyes
sans
taste
sans
everything
the
castaway
from
by
daniel
defoe
and
now
our
case
was
very
dismal
indeed
for
we
all
saw
plainly
that
the
sea
went
so
high
that
the
boat
could
not
escape
and
that
we
should
be
inevitably
drowned
as
to
making
sail
we
had
none
nor
if
we
had
could
we
have
done
anything
with
it
so
we
worked
at
the
oar
towards
the
land
though
with
heavy
hearts
like
men
going
to
execution
for
we
all
knew
that
when
the
boat
came
near
the
shore
she
would
be
dashed
in
a
thousand
pieces
by
the
beach
of
the
sea
however
we
committed
our
souls
to
god
in
the
most
earnest
manner
and
the
wind
driving
us
towards
the
shore
we
hastened
our
destruction
with
our
own
hands
pulling
as
well
as
we
could
towards
land
what
the
shore
was
whether
rock
or
sand
whether
steep
or
shoal
we
knew
not
the
only
hope
that
could
rationally
give
us
the
least
shadow
of
expectation
was
if
we
might
happen
into
some
bay
or
gulf
or
the
mouth
of
some
river
where
by
great
chance
we
might
have
run
our
boat
in
or
got
under
the
lee
of
the
land
and
perhaps
made
smooth
water
but
there
was
nothing
of
this
appeared
but
as
we
made
nearer
and
nearer
the
shore
the
land
looked
more
frightful
than
the
sea
after
we
had
rowed
or
rather
driven
about
a
league
and
a
half
as
we
reckoned
it
a
raging
wave
came
rolling
astern
of
us
and
plainly
bade
us
expect
the
de
in
a
word
it
took
us
with
such
a
fury
that
it
overset
the
boat
at
once
and
separating
us
as
well
from
the
boat
as
from
one
another
gave
us
not
time
hardly
to
say
o
god
for
we
were
all
swallowed
up
in
a
moment
nothing
can
describe
the
confusion
of
thought
which
i
felt
when
i
sank
into
the
water
for
though
i
swam
very
well
yet
i
could
not
deliver
myself
from
the
waves
so
as
to
draw
breath
till
that
wave
having
driven
me
or
rather
carried
me
a
vast
way
on
towards
the
shore
and
having
spent
itself
went
back
and
left
me
upon
the
land
almost
dry
but
half
dead
with
the
water
i
took
in
i
had
so
much
presence
of
mind
as
well
as
breath
left
that
seeing
myself
nearer
the
mainland
than
i
expected
i
got
upon
my
feet
and
endeavored
to
make
on
towards
the
land
as
fast
as
i
could
before
another
wave
should
return
and
take
me
up
again
but
i
soon
found
it
was
impossible
to
avoid
it
for
i
saw
the
sea
come
after
me
as
high
as
a
great
hill
and
as
furious
as
an
enemy
which
i
had
no
means
or
strength
to
contend
with
my
business
was
to
hold
my
breath
and
raise
myself
upon
the
water
if
i
could
and
so
by
swimming
to
preserve
my
breathing
and
pilot
myself
towards
the
shore
if
possible
my
greatest
concern
now
being
that
the
wave
as
it
would
carry
me
a
great
way
toward
the
shore
when
it
came
on
might
not
carry
me
back
again
with
it
when
it
gave
back
towards
the
sea
the
wave
that
came
upon
me
again
buried
me
at
once
twenty
or
thirty
feet
deep
in
its
own
body
and
i
could
feel
myself
i
carried
with
a
mighty
force
and
swiftness
towards
the
shore
a
very
great
way
but
i
held
my
breath
and
assisted
myself
to
swim
still
forward
with
all
my
might
i
was
ready
to
burst
with
holding
my
breath
when
as
i
felt
myself
rising
up
so
to
my
immediate
relief
i
found
my
head
and
hands
shoot
out
above
the
surface
of
the
water
and
though
it
was
not
two
seconds
of
time
that
i
could
keep
myself
so
yet
it
relieved
me
greatly
gave
me
breath
and
new
courage
i
was
covered
again
with
water
a
good
while
but
not
so
long
but
i
held
it
out
and
finding
the
water
had
spent
itself
and
began
to
return
i
struck
forward
against
the
return
of
the
waves
and
felt
ground
again
with
my
feet
i
stood
still
a
few
moments
to
recover
breath
and
till
the
waters
went
from
me
and
then
took
to
my
heels
and
ran
with
what
strength
i
had
farther
towards
the
shore
but
neither
would
this
deliver
me
from
the
fury
of
the
sea
which
came
pouring
in
after
me
again
and
twice
more
i
was
lifted
up
by
the
waves
and
carried
forwards
as
before
the
shore
being
very
flat
the
last
time
of
these
two
had
been
fatal
to
me
for
the
sea
having
hurried
me
along
as
before
landed
me
or
rather
dashed
me
against
a
piece
of
a
rock
and
that
with
such
force
as
it
left
me
senseless
and
indeed
helpless
as
to
my
own
deliverance
for
the
blow
taking
my
side
and
breast
beat
the
breath
as
it
were
quite
out
of
my
body
and
had
it
returned
again
immediately
i
must
have
been
strangled
in
the
water
but
i
recovered
a
little
before
the
return
of
the
waves
and
seeing
i
should
be
covered
again
with
the
water
i
resolved
to
hold
fast
by
a
piece
of
the
rock
and
so
to
hold
my
breath
if
possible
till
the
wave
went
back
now
as
the
waves
were
not
so
high
as
at
first
being
nearer
land
i
held
my
hold
till
the
wave
abated
and
then
fetched
another
run
which
brought
me
so
near
the
shore
that
the
next
wave
though
it
went
over
me
yet
did
not
so
swallow
me
up
as
to
carry
me
away
and
the
next
run
i
took
i
got
to
the
mainland
where
to
my
great
comfort
i
clambered
up
the
cliffs
of
the
shore
and
sat
me
down
upon
the
grass
free
from
danger
and
quite
out
of
the
reach
of
the
water
i
was
now
landed
and
safe
on
shore
and
began
to
look
up
and
thank
god
that
my
life
was
saved
in
a
case
wherein
there
was
some
minutes
before
scarce
any
room
to
hope
i
believe
it
is
impossible
to
express
to
the
life
what
the
ecstasies
and
transports
of
the
soul
are
when
it
is
so
saved
as
i
may
say
out
of
the
very
grave
and
i
do
not
wonder
now
at
that
custom
when
a
malefactor
who
has
the
halter
about
his
neck
is
tied
up
and
just
going
to
be
turned
off
and
has
a
reprieve
brought
to
him
i
say
i
do
not
wonder
that
they
bring
a
surgeon
with
it
to
let
him
blood
that
very
moment
they
tell
him
of
it
that
the
surprise
may
not
drive
the
animal
spirits
from
the
heart
and
overwhelm
him
for
sudden
joys
like
griefs
confound
at
first
i
walked
about
on
the
shore
lifting
up
my
hands
and
my
whole
being
as
i
may
say
wrapt
up
in
a
contemplation
of
my
deliverance
making
a
thousand
gestures
and
motions
which
i
can
not
describe
reflecting
upon
all
my
comrades
that
were
drowned
and
that
there
should
not
be
one
soul
saved
but
myself
for
as
for
them
i
never
saw
them
afterwards
or
any
sign
of
them
except
three
of
their
hats
one
cap
and
two
shoes
that
were
not
fellows
i
cast
my
eyes
to
the
stranded
vessel
when
the
breach
and
froth
of
the
sea
being
so
big
i
could
hardly
see
it
it
lay
so
far
off
and
considered
lord
how
was
it
possible
i
could
get
on
shore
after
i
had
solaced
my
mind
with
the
comfortable
part
of
my
condition
i
began
to
look
round
me
to
see
what
kind
of
place
i
was
in
and
what
was
next
to
be
done
and
i
soon
found
my
comforts
abate
and
that
in
a
word
i
had
a
dreadful
deliverance
for
i
was
wet
had
no
clothes
to
shift
me
nor
anything
either
to
eat
or
drink
to
comfort
me
neither
did
i
see
any
prospect
before
me
but
that
of
perishing
with
hunger
or
being
devoured
by
wild
beasts
and
that
which
was
particularly
afflicting
to
me
was
that
i
had
no
weapon
either
to
hunt
and
kill
any
creature
for
my
sustenance
or
to
defend
myself
against
any
other
creature
that
might
desire
to
kill
me
for
theirs
in
a
word
i
had
nothing
about
me
but
a
knife
a
and
a
little
tobacco
in
a
box
this
was
all
my
provision
and
this
threw
me
into
terrible
agonies
of
mind
that
for
awhile
i
ran
about
like
a
madman
night
coming
upon
me
i
began
with
a
heavy
heart
to
consider
what
would
be
my
lot
if
there
were
any
ravenous
beasts
in
that
country
seeing
at
night
they
always
come
abroad
for
their
prey
all
the
remedy
that
offered
to
my
thoughts
at
that
time
was
to
get
up
into
a
thick
busby
tree
like
a
fir
but
thorny
which
grew
near
me
and
where
i
resolved
to
sit
all
night
and
consider
the
next
day
what
death
i
should
die
for
as
yet
i
saw
no
prospect
of
life
i
walked
about
a
furlong
from
the
shore
to
see
if
i
could
find
any
fresh
water
to
drink
which
i
did
to
my
great
joy
and
having
drunk
and
put
a
little
tobacco
in
my
mouth
to
prevent
hunger
i
went
to
the
tree
and
getting
up
into
it
endeavored
to
place
myself
so
that
if
i
should
sleep
i
might
not
fall
and
having
cut
me
a
short
stick
like
a
truncheon
for
my
defense
i
took
up
my
lodging
and
being
excessively
fatigued
i
fell
fast
asleep
and
slept
as
comfortably
as
i
believe
few
could
have
done
in
my
condition
and
found
myself
more
refreshed
with
it
than
i
think
i
ever
was
on
such
an
occasion
when
i
waked
it
was
broad
day
the
weather
clear
and
the
storm
abated
so
that
the
sea
did
not
rage
and
swell
as
before
but
that
which
surprised
me
most
was
that
the
ship
was
lifted
off
in
the
night
from
the
sand
where
she
lay
by
the
swelling
of
the
tide
and
was
driven
up
almost
as
far
as
the
rock
which
i
at
first
mentioned
where
i
had
been
so
bruised
by
the
wave
dashing
me
against
it
this
being
within
about
a
mile
from
the
shore
where
i
was
and
the
ship
seeming
to
stand
upright
still
i
wished
myself
on
board
that
at
least
i
might
save
some
necessary
things
for
my
use
when
i
came
down
from
my
apartment
in
the
tree
i
looked
about
me
again
and
the
first
thing
i
found
was
the
boat
which
lay
as
the
wind
and
sea
had
tossed
her
up
upon
the
land
about
two
miles
on
my
right
hand
i
walked
as
far
as
i
could
upon
the
shore
to
have
got
to
her
but
found
a
neck
or
inlet
of
water
between
me
and
the
boat
which
was
about
half
a
mile
broad
so
i
came
back
for
the
present
being
more
intent
upon
getting
at
the
ship
where
i
hoped
to
find
something
for
my
present
subsistence
a
little
after
noon
i
found
the
sea
very
calm
and
the
tide
ebbed
so
far
out
that
i
could
come
within
a
quarter
of
a
mile
of
the
ship
and
here
i
found
a
fresh
renewing
of
my
grief
for
i
saw
evidently
that
if
we
had
kept
on
board
we
had
been
all
safe
that
is
to
say
we
had
all
got
safe
on
shore
and
i
had
not
been
so
miserable
as
to
be
left
entirely
destitute
of
all
comfort
and
company
as
i
now
was
this
forced
tears
to
my
eyes
again
but
as
there
was
little
relief
in
that
i
resolved
if
possible
to
get
to
the
so
i
pulled
off
my
clothes
for
the
weather
was
hot
to
extremity
and
took
the
water
but
when
i
came
to
the
ship
my
difficulty
was
still
greater
to
know
how
to
get
on
board
for
as
she
lay
aground
and
high
out
of
the
water
there
was
nothing
within
my
reach
to
lay
hold
of
i
swam
round
her
twice
and
the
second
time
i
espied
a
small
piece
of
rope
which
i
wondered
i
did
not
see
at
first
hanging
down
by
the
so
low
that
with
great
difficulty
i
got
hold
of
it
and
by
the
help
of
that
rope
got
up
into
the
forecastle
of
the
ship
here
i
found
that
the
ship
was
bulged
and
had
a
great
deal
of
water
in
her
hold
but
that
she
lay
so
on
the
side
of
a
bank
of
hard
sand
or
rather
earth
that
her
stern
lay
lifted
up
upon
the
bank
and
her
head
low
almost
to
the
water
by
this
means
all
her
quarter
was
free
and
all
that
was
in
that
part
was
dry
for
you
may
be
sure
my
first
work
was
to
search
and
to
see
what
was
spoiled
and
what
was
free
and
first
i
found
that
all
the
ship
provisions
were
dry
and
untouched
by
the
water
and
being
very
well
disposed
to
eat
i
went
to
the
and
filled
my
pockets
with
biscuit
and
ate
it
as
i
went
about
other
things
for
i
had
no
time
to
lose
i
also
found
some
rum
in
the
great
cabin
of
which
i
took
a
large
dram
and
which
i
had
indeed
need
enough
of
to
spirit
me
for
what
was
before
me
now
i
wanted
nothing
but
a
boat
to
furnish
myself
with
many
things
which
i
foresaw
would
be
very
necessary
to
me
it
was
in
vain
to
sit
still
and
wish
for
what
was
not
to
be
had
and
this
extremity
roused
my
application
we
had
several
spare
yards
and
two
or
three
large
spars
of
wood
and
a
spare
topmast
or
two
in
the
ship
i
resolved
to
fall
tp
work
with
these
and
i
flung
as
many
of
them
overboard
as
i
could
manage
for
their
weight
tying
every
one
with
a
rope
that
they
might
not
drive
away
when
this
was
done
i
went
down
the
ship
side
and
pulling
them
to
me
i
tied
four
of
them
together
at
both
ends
as
well
as
i
could
in
the
form
of
a
raft
and
laying
two
or
three
short
pieces
of
plank
upon
them
crossways
i
found
i
could
walk
upon
it
very
well
but
that
it
was
not
able
to
bear
any
great
weight
the
pieces
being
too
light
so
i
went
to
work
and
with
the
carpenter
saw
i
cut
a
spare
topmast
into
three
lengths
and
added
them
to
my
raft
with
a
great
deal
of
labor
and
pains
but
the
hope
of
furnishing
myself
with
necessaries
encouraged
me
to
go
beyond
what
i
should
have
been
able
to
have
done
upon
another
occasion
my
raft
was
now
strong
enough
to
bear
any
reasonable
weight
my
next
care
was
what
to
load
it
with
and
how
to
preserve
what
i
laid
upon
it
from
the
surf
of
the
sea
but
i
was
not
long
considering
this
i
first
laid
all
the
planks
or
boards
upon
it
that
i
could
get
and
having
considered
well
what
i
most
wanted
i
first
got
three
of
the
seamen
chests
which
i
had
broken
open
and
emptied
and
lowered
them
down
upon
my
raft
the
first
of
these
i
filled
with
provisions
bread
rice
three
dutch
cheeses
five
pieces
of
dried
goat
flesh
which
we
lived
much
upon
and
a
little
remainder
of
european
corn
which
had
been
laid
by
for
some
fowls
which
we
brought
to
sea
with
us
but
the
fowls
were
killed
there
had
been
some
barley
and
wheat
together
but
to
my
great
disappointment
i
found
afterwards
that
the
rats
had
eaten
or
spoiled
it
all
as
for
liquors
i
found
several
cases
of
bottles
belonging
to
our
skipper
in
which
were
some
cordial
waters
and
in
all
about
five
or
six
gallons
of
arrack
these
i
stowed
by
themselves
there
being
no
need
to
put
them
into
the
chest
nor
any
room
for
them
while
i
was
doing
this
i
found
the
tide
began
to
flow
though
very
calm
and
i
had
the
mortification
to
see
my
coat
shirt
and
waistcoat
which
i
had
left
on
shore
upon
the
sand
swim
away
as
for
my
breeches
which
were
only
linen
and
i
swam
on
board
in
them
and
my
stockings
however
this
put
me
upon
rummaging
for
clothes
of
which
i
found
enough
but
took
no
more
than
i
wanted
for
present
use
for
i
had
other
things
which
my
eye
was
more
upon
as
first
tools
to
work
with
on
shore
and
it
was
after
long
searching
that
i
found
out
the
carpenter
chest
which
was
indeed
a
very
useful
prize
to
me
and
much
more
valuable
than
a
of
gold
would
have
been
at
that
time
i
got
it
down
to
my
raft
whole
as
it
was
without
losing
time
to
look
into
it
for
i
knew
in
general
what
it
contained
my
next
care
was
for
some
ammunition
and
arms
there
were
two
very
good
in
the
great
cabin
and
two
pistols
these
i
secured
first
with
some
a
small
bag
of
shot
and
two
old
rusty
swords
i
knew
there
were
three
barrels
of
powder
in
the
ship
but
knew
not
where
our
gunner
had
stowed
them
but
with
much
search
i
found
them
two
of
them
dry
and
good
the
third
had
taken
water
those
two
i
got
to
my
raft
with
the
arms
and
now
i
thought
myself
pretty
well
freighted
and
began
to
think
how
i
should
get
to
shore
with
them
having
neither
sail
oar
nor
rudder
and
the
least
capful
of
wind
would
have
overset
all
my
navigation
i
had
three
encouragements
first
a
smooth
calm
sea
secondly
the
tide
rising
and
setting
in
to
the
shore
thirdly
what
little
wind
there
was
blew
me
towards
the
land
and
thus
having
found
two
or
three
broken
oars
belonging
to
the
boat
and
besides
the
tools
which
were
in
the
chest
two
saws
an
axe
and
a
hammer
with
this
cargo
i
put
to
sea
for
a
mile
or
thereabouts
my
raft
went
very
well
only
that
i
found
it
drive
a
little
distant
from
the
place
where
i
had
landed
before
by
which
i
perceived
that
there
was
some
indraught
of
the
water
and
consequently
i
hoped
to
find
some
creek
or
river
there
which
i
might
malze
use
of
as
a
port
to
get
to
land
with
my
cargo
as
i
imagined
so
it
was
there
appeared
before
me
a
little
opening
of
the
land
i
found
a
strong
current
of
the
tide
set
into
it
so
i
guided
my
raft
as
well
as
i
could
to
keep
in
the
middle
of
the
stream
but
here
i
had
like
to
have
suffered
a
second
shipwreck
which
if
i
had
i
think
verily
would
have
broken
my
heart
for
knowing
nothing
of
the
coast
my
raft
ran
aground
at
one
end
of
it
upon
a
shoal
and
not
being
aground
at
the
other
end
it
wanted
but
a
little
that
all
my
cargo
had
slipped
off
towards
the
end
that
was
afloat
and
so
fallen
into
the
water
i
did
my
utmost
by
setting
my
back
against
the
chests
to
keep
them
in
their
places
but
could
not
thrust
off
the
raft
with
all
my
strength
neither
durst
i
stir
from
the
posture
i
was
in
but
holding
up
the
chests
with
all
my
might
i
stood
in
that
manner
near
half
an
hour
in
which
time
the
rising
of
the
water
brought
me
a
little
more
upon
a
level
and
a
little
after
the
water
still
rising
my
raft
floated
again
and
i
thrust
her
off
with
the
oar
i
had
into
the
channel
and
then
driving
up
higher
i
at
length
found
myself
in
the
mouth
of
a
little
river
with
land
on
both
sides
and
a
strong
current
or
tide
running
up
i
looked
on
both
sides
for
a
proper
place
to
get
to
shore
for
i
was
not
willing
to
be
driven
too
high
up
the
river
hoping
in
time
to
see
some
ship
at
sea
and
therefore
resolved
to
place
myself
as
near
the
coast
as
i
could
at
length
i
spied
a
little
cove
on
the
right
shore
of
the
creek
to
which
with
great
pain
and
difficulty
i
guided
my
raft
and
at
last
got
so
near
that
reaching
ground
with
my
oar
i
could
thrust
her
directly
in
but
here
i
had
like
to
have
dipped
all
my
cargo
into
the
sea
again
for
that
shore
lying
pretty
is
to
say
sloping
there
was
no
place
to
land
but
where
one
end
of
my
float
if
it
ran
on
shore
would
lie
so
high
and
the
other
sink
lower
as
before
that
it
would
endanger
my
cargo
again
all
that
i
could
do
was
to
wait
till
the
tide
was
at
the
highest
keeping
the
raft
with
my
oar
like
an
anchor
to
hold
the
side
of
it
fast
to
the
shore
near
a
flat
piece
of
ground
which
i
expected
the
water
would
flow
over
and
so
it
did
as
soon
as
i
found
water
enough
for
my
raft
drew
about
a
foot
of
water
i
thrust
her
upon
that
flat
piece
of
ground
and
there
fastened
or
moored
her
by
sticking
my
two
broken
oars
into
the
on
one
side
near
one
end
and
one
on
the
other
side
near
the
other
end
and
thus
i
lay
till
the
water
ebbed
away
and
left
my
raft
and
all
my
cargo
safe
on
shore
reading
lists
one
of
the
best
ways
to
words
is
through
seeing
them
used
by
the
masters
for
this
reason
as
well
as
for
many
others
you
should
read
extensively
in
good
literature
the
following
lists
of
prose
works
may
prove
useful
for
your
guidance
they
are
not
intended
to
be
exclusive
not
intended
to
designate
the
hundred
best
books
rather
do
they
name
some
good
books
of
fairly
varied
types
these
are
not
all
of
equal
merit
even
in
their
use
of
words
some
use
words
with
nice
discrimination
some
with
splendid
vividness
and
force
for
each
author
only
one
or
two
books
are
named
but
in
many
instances
you
will
wish
to
read
further
in
the
author
perhaps
indeed
his
entire
works
biography

autobiography
