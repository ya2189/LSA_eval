this
paper
is
an
attempt
to
describe
the
mixed
races
which
inhabited
orkney
and
shetland
from
the
foundation
of
the
norse
earldom
in
until
the
end
of
the
rule
of
the
gaelic
earls
and
it
is
a
first
instalment
of
the
evidence
on
which
a
paragraph
on
was
founded
in
the
to
and
shetland
vol
i
the
earliest
inhabitants
of
whom
we
have
any
record
were
the
picts
and
the
irish
papas
and
columban
missionaries
who
must
have
brought
some
irish
settlers
with
them
it
has
already
been
suggested
that
the
norse
must
have
settled
in
orkney
and
shetland
among
the
aboriginal
race
the
picts
who
would
have
become
their
thralls
and
with
whom
the
settlers
would
have
intermarried
the
first
norsemen
who
came
to
orkney
and
shetland
would
have
been
adventurers
and
not
settlers
with
wives
families
and
thralls
such
as
later
went
to
iceland
and
orkney
consequently
such
adventurers
who
settled
in
the
islands
would
naturally
have
intermarried
with
the
aborigines
this
kind
of
male
settlement
may
have
gone
on
for
some
time
before
the
actual
colonisation
took
place
it
has
already
been
pointed
out
that
shetland
was
not
so
fully
colonised
as
orkney
at
the
commencement
of
the
norse
migration
which
appears
to
account
for
the
older
norse
dialect
forms
in
orkney
and
for
the
survival
of
more
keltic
in
shetland
a
stronger
pictish
strain
is
thus
on
that
account
to
be
looked
for
in
shetland
the
norse
would
select
the
easiest
while
the
kelts
would
occupy
the
inland
and
inaccessible
places
as
they
did
in
the
isle
of
man
the
two
inland
districts
of
hara
and
stennes
in
orkney
are
especially
rich
in
the
remains
of
the
inhabitants
stone
circles
brochs
etc
and
ireland
the
only
of
stennes
is
particularly
inhospitable
for
shipping
besides
the
archæological
and
topographical
proof
of
the
continued
residence
of
the
picts
in
orkney
and
shetland
there
is
the
much
more
reliable
evidence
of
anthropology
in
the
existence
of
a
large
strain
of
the
small
and
dark
race
in
both
orkney
and
shetland
representing
the
aboriginal
race
the
later
prisoners
of
raids
and
the
later
settlers
from
scotland
allowance
must
also
be
made
for
thralls
brought
from
norway
queen
auðr
djúpauðga
or
djúpúðga
passed
through
orkney
in
the
ninth
century
on
her
way
to
iceland
with
twenty
freed
irish
thralls
after
this
einarr
grandson
of
earl
went
to
iceland
from
orkney
with
two
vestmenn
irishmen
irish
occurs
in
in
iceland
orkney
and
shetland
in
each
of
which
latter
there
is
an
it
will
now
be
proved
that
there
were
only
three
possible
norse
earls
of
orkney
and
shetland
the
first
three
sigurðr
hinn
ríki
his
son
guþormr
and
his
nephew
hallaðr
the
first
earl
of
the
main
line
was
who
was
half
norse
and
half
thrall
his
mother
being
probably
of
the
dark
race
his
son
the
next
earl
married
a
gael
and
after
this
through
repeated
gaelic
marriages
the
succeeding
earls
in
the
norse
male
line
were
never
more
than
a
cross
between
norse
and
gael
sometimes
almost
approaching
gaels
if
the
rules
of
a
modern
breeding
society
are
to
be
observed
the
same
holds
good
of
earl
rögnvaldr
a
norwegian
who
succeeded
on
the
distaff
side
his
mother
being
of
gaelic
extraction
the
gaelic
conversion
of
the
earls
was
completed
on
the
succession
of
the
gaelic
earls
in
the
next
step
will
be
to
show
that
the
leading
families
some
of
which
were
related
to
the
earls
were
also
mainly
of
gaelic
descent
and
in
some
cases
probably
in
the
male
line
as
the
gaels
did
not
give
up
patronymics
and
begin
to
assume
permanent
surnames
usually
those
of
their
chiefs
until
after
those
who
settled
in
orkney
before
that
and
became
norse
in
language
and
customs
of
course
adopted
the
norse
in
place
of
the
gaelic
patronymic
for
this
was
done
by
the
gaelic
earls
in
orkney
in
precisely
the
same
way
as
had
been
done
by
the
irish
settlers
in
iceland
in
reply
to
a
query
sir
herbert
maxwell
writes
ask
me
to
fix
a
date
patronymics
flourished
and
ceased
in
the
highlands
i
think
it
would
be
impossible
to
do
so
there
were
few
if
any
fixed
surnames
in
england
or
lowland
scotland
before
the
middle
of
the
thirteenth
century
other
than
territorial
ones
derived
from
the
feudal
tenure
of
land
in
the
highlands
the
adoption
of
fixed
names
appears
to
have
been
indefinitely
deferred
such
counties
as
perth
and
dumbarton
being
nearest
the
frontier
of
civilisation
their
people
would
find
it
convenient
to
conform
to
the
habit
of
their
neighbours
in
more
remote
districts
the
shifting
patronymic
prevailed
much
longer
and
when
it
was
abandoned
individuals
frequently
assumed
the
surname
of
their
chief
or
the
name
of
his
clan
which
accounts
for
the
old
patronymic
being
the
third
commonest
surname
in
scotland
smith
and
brown
being
first
and
in
the
following
description
particular
attention
will
be
called
to
personal
appearance
character
habits
superstitions
as
indications
of
descent
the
norse
earls
earl
was
the
illegitimate
son
of
the
norwegian
earl
rögnvaldr
by
a
thrall
mother
who
was
thrall
born
on
all
sides
allar
ættir
he
was
therefore
half
norse
and
half
thrall
his
mother
was
probably
of
the
small
dark
race
the
finnar
or
lappir
which
may
account
for
her
son
being
ugly
but
an
expression
which
latterly
meant
and
capable
of
seeing
elves
etc
he
saw
what
others
did
not
hálfdán
the
of
orkney
bobbing
up
and
down
on
another
island
and
had
a
carved
on
him
his
poetic
genius
may
have
been
the
result
of
the
mixture
of
norse
and
finn
he
died
of
sickness
equivalent
to
died
in
bed
an
ignominious
death
for
a
víkingr
nothing
is
known
of
his
wife
but
as
he
had
children
before
he
left
norway
she
was
probably
a
norwegian
his
children
were
earls
þorfinnr
arnkell
and
erlendr
and
two
daughters
þórdís
born
in
his
youth
in
norway
she
was
brought
up
by
her
grandfather
earl
rögnvaldr
and
married
þórgeirr
klaufi
whose
son
einarr
went
to
orkney
to
his
kinsmen
and
as
they
would
not
receive
him
he
bought
a
ship
and
went
to
iceland
and
hlíf
who
had
descendants
in
iceland
earl
þorfinnr
hausakljúfr
was
the
son
of
earl
and
an
unknown
mother
probably
norwegian
so
that
he
would
be
norse
and
thrall
in
descent
he
married
grelöð
a
daughter
of
dungað
gaelic
duncan
gaelic
earl
of
caithness
and
gróa
daughter
of
þorsteinn

he
is

as
a

chief
and
warrior
höfðingi
ok
and
died
of
sickness
and
was
buried
in
a
mound
in
rögnvaldsey
at
hoxa
the
saga
reads
wrongly
this
isthmus
would
have
been
called
isthmus
because
the
norse
found
on
it
a
large
mound
which
covered
the
ruins
of
a
round
tower
in
which
the
earl
may
have
been
buried
his
children
were
earls
arnfinnr
hávarðr
of
prosperous
years
hlöðver
ljótr
or
arnljótr
and
skúli
and
two
daughters
three
of

sons
married
in

the

daughter
of

killed
her

herself
the

was
killed
by
his
nephew
einarr
klíningr

at
the
instigation
of
his
aunt
who
promised
to
marry
him
and
for
which
deed
he
was

to
be
a
dastard
preparatory
to
marrying
the
third
brother
she
got
rid
of
einarr
at
the
hands
of
his
cousin
einarr
harðkjöptr
who
was
in
turn
slain
by
the
third
and
last
husband
one
can
not
wonder
at
the
character
of
ragnhildr
considering
the
antecedents
of
her
mother
gunnhildr
the
reputed
daughter
of
özurr
toti
a
lord
in

probably

was

struck
with
her
great
beauty
obtained
her
in

she
was
held
guilty
of
having
poisoned

life
was

in

mischief
she
is
described
in
the
fairest
of
women
wise

cunning
in
witchcraft
glad
of

guileful
of

the
of
the

had

thus
the

a
distinction

drawn
between

which

which
leaves
no
possibility
of
a
doubt
as
to
the
true
origin
of
the
name
with
regard
to
nicknames
those
which
are
person
forenames
in
themselves
such
as
buck
and
personifications
such
as
landlouper
are
used
in
formation
while
nicknames
which
merely
point
to
an
eccentricity
in
personal
detail
and
are
attached
to
forenames
such
as
flat
nose
do
not
lend
themselves
for
but
even
if
such
nicknames
were
detached
from
their
forenames
and
applied
to
places
they
would
be
in
the
genitive
case
if
hákon

had
been
known
as

of

there
is
no
evidence
then
his

would
have

not
which
could
only
point
to

such
as

he
would
have
held

nothing

he
is
described
as
a

man
and
had
the
calling
out
of

he
smelt
a
rat
when
the
invading
earl
rögnvaldr
played
a
clever
trick
in
getting
the
fair
isle

lit
and
his
pawky
speech
thwarted
the
internecine
complications
which
that
deed
was
designed
to
arouse
earl
rögnvaldr
however
unexpectedly
landed
in
westrey
whereupon
the
the
beards
louped
together
to
get
advice
which
was
that
they
should
at
once
get
peace
from
the
earl
and
he
and
the
vestreyingar
submitted
to
the
earl
and
swore
oaths
to
him
one
night
however
the
men
caught
kúgi
napping
at
a
secret
meeting
for
treachery
against
the
earl
he
was
promptly
put
in
fetters
when
the
earl
arrived
on
the
scene
kúgi
fell
at
his
feet
and
offered
or
left
all
his
case
in
hands
and
the
he
then
tried
to
shift
the
blame
on
to
others
and
asserted
that
he
had
been
brought
to
the
þing
unwilling
and
that
all
the
bœndr
had
wanted
him
to
be
the
instigator
of
the
plot
the
saga
states
that
kúgi
pleaded
his
own
cause
with
great
elocution
or
glibly
fortunately
for
life
the
humour
of
the
situation
tickled
the
poetic
fancy
to
such
a
degree
that
he
could
not
resist
the
temptation
of
letting
off
steam
in
one
of
his
habitual
improvisations
stuffed
with
scathing
ridicule
a
lasting
punishment
more
severe
than
the
decapitation
or
sound
drubbing
which
the
object
of
his
poetic
flight
so
richly
deserved
the
earl
referred
to
the
fettered
man
before
him
as
a
a
carl
or
old
duffer
and
advised
him
in
future
never
to
hold
night
meetings
which
vigfússon
says
were
not
considered
proper
the
earl
further
admonished
him
that
it
was
needful
to
keep
oath
and
covenant
peace
was
given
to
all
and
they
bound
their
fellowship
anew

may
be
mentioned
his

asked

spoil
sveinn
said
that
they
should
all
share
equally
except
himself
who
should
have
a

because
he
said
he

þorbjörn

they
also
wished
all

to

the

said
it

time
that
sveinn
was
an
unfair
man
and
the
day
of
retribution
would
come
for
his

the

made

what

where
he
had
the
the

of
the

and
where
sveinn
was
afterwards
sýslumaðr
the

appears
to
have
been
a
caithness
one
and
the

claim
to
be
descended
from

taken
in
conjunction
with
the
personal
characteristics
and
the
numerous
gaelic
names
of
members
of
the
family
relations
and
friends
makes
it
probable
that
these
families
were
all
of
gaelic
descent
in
the
male
line
sveinn
brjóstreip
had
a
kinsman
jón
of
whose

nothing
more
is

he
was
a
hirðmaðr
of
earl

by
whom
he
was
well
esteemed

he
spent
the
summer
in
víking
and
the
winter
with
the
earl
he
was
a
man
and
strong
of
dark
complexion
and
rather
he
was
a
great
wizard
and
had
always
sat
out
at
night
as
a
wizard
in
order
to
raise
ghosts
which
in
accordance
with
old
gulathinglaw
was
an
unfinable
crime
punished
by
outlawry
he
was
one
of
the
forecastle
men
and
was
the
foremost
of
all
the
men
in
battle
and
fought
bravely
sveinn
preferred
to
attending
midnight
mass
on
yule
the
bishop
hailed
his
slaughter
as
a
cleansing
of
the
land
of
miscreants
it
was
the
opinion
of
ragna
of
rinansey
that
the
earl
had
little
scathe
in
sveinn
even
though
he
were
a
great
warrior
or
bravo
and
that
the
earl
had
suffered
much
unpopularity
through

there
can
be
little
doubt
as
to
the
race
of
the
swarthy

the
differentiation
between
the
norwegians
and
the
mixed
race
in
orkney
is
unmistakably
brought
into
prominence
in
the
middle
of
the
twelfth
century
when
the
norwegian
contingent
of
the
famous
crusade
which
wintered
in
orkney
got
on
so
ill
with
the
islanders
that
it
resulted
in
murder
and
bloodshed
about
love
and
mercantile
affairs
the
earls
who
were
of
gaelic
descent
in
the
female
line
while
exhibiting
gaelic
features
were
also
good
rulers
and
great
warriors
whose
exploits
provided
good
copy
for
the
which
was
probably
written
down
by
icelanders
the
gaelic
admixture
of
blood
in
orkney
does
not
appear
to
have
produced
any
literary
or
poetic
talent
such
as
it
did
in

first
of
these
sagas
is
prefaced
with
a
summary
of
the
sagas
of
the
preceding
earls
of

none
have
been

while
the

is
prefaced

the
saga
of

is
partly
preserved
in
the

in
as
regards
orkney
poets
earl
the
skáld
was
a
norwegian
by
birth
and
family
with
a
thrall
mother
probably
finnish
from
which
admixture
of
norse
and
dark
races
he
probably
derived
his
ugly
appearance
and
poetic
genius
earl
rögnvaldr
the
skáld
was
also
a
norwegian
by
birth
and
the
son
of
a
norwegian
father
while
his
mother
was
an
orkney
woman
of
gaelic
extraction
bishop
biarni
the
skáld
was
the
only
orkney
born
poet
but
his
father
was
also
a
norwegian
and
his
mother
an
orkney
woman
of
gaelic
extraction
it
is
just
possible
that
these
two
skálds
derived
their
poetic
inspiration
from
just
the
right
dash
of
gaelic
descent
all
the
other
poets
whose
compositions
are
recorded
in
the
saga
were
icelanders
arnórr
jarlaskáld
hallr
etc
it
goes
without
saying
that
orcadians
and
shetlanders
must
have
been
like
their
fellow
norsemen
of
the
period
improvisers
whose
verses
although
referred
to
have
not
been
preserved
there
were
only
two
orkney
saints
earls
magnús
and
rögnvaldr
the
one
was
martyred
and
the
other
assassinated
and
both
of
them
had
very
little
gaelic
blood
it
is
a
question
whether
orkney
and
shetland
with
their
christian
picts
and
heathen
norse
in
the
seventh
eighth
and
ninth
centuries
were
the
of
some
of
the
edda
lays
and
whether
any
of
these
lays
were
current
there
as
oral
tradition
and
taken
down
in
writing
in
the
twelfth
century
by
earl
rögnvaldr
and
his
icelandic
skálds
the
solitary
preservation
and
use
of
many
edda
poetic
words
in
shetland
is
significant
the
first
notices
we
have
of
writing
in
the
saga
are
in
when
kali
kolsson
afterwards
earl
rögnvaldr
kali
in
a
verse
numbered
among
his
accomplishments
reading
and
writing
and
in
when
earl
erlendr
produced
king
letter
at
the
þing
in
kirkjuvágr
with
regard
to
it
will
have
been
noted
that
the
norse
earls
in
the
male
line
although
half
gaels
always
gave
their
children
norse
names
while
the
gaelic
earls
who
were
only
of
slight
norse
descent
gave
their
children
norse
gaelic
and
english
names
so
that
the
gœðingar
and
other
leading
families
of
the
late
eleventh
and
early
twelfth
centuries
who
also
gave
their
children
norse
gaelic
and
english
names
were
therefore
probably
like
the
gaelic
earls
also
of
gaelic
descent
in
the
male
line
this
is
also
in
accordance
with
the
known
practice
of
other
gaelic
settlers
in
iceland
etc
the
characteristics
of
persons
of
gaelic
descent
are
most
pronounced
black
hair
swarthy
complexion
quarrelsome
given
to
witchcraft
pawky
and
glib
which
perhaps
point
to
the
iberian
element
rather
than
to
the
true
gael
and
that
in
comparison
with
the
norse
accomplished
and
generous
makers
of
hard
bargains
which
they
however
kept
true
to
their
word
etc
it
must
be
remembered
that
these
comparative
characteristics
are
the
observations
of
the
norsemen
themselves
who
wrote
the
saga
probably
icelanders
and
therefore
presumably
exaggerated
in
their
own
favour
they
are
valuable
however
in
placing
beyond
doubt
the
large
strain
of
people
who
lived
in
orkney
it
has
been
shown
that
the
gaelic
earls
adopted
norse
patronymics
and
that
all
persons
in
orkney
and
shetland
before
used
norse
patronymics
including
the
numerous
gaelic
families
which
must
have
settled
in
the
islands
there
was
no
other
alternative
just
as
it
was
conversely
the
case
in
the
hebrides
where
the
gaels
predominated
and
where
their
language
prevailed
and
was
adopted
by
the
norsemen
here
the
norse
became
gaelic
etc
compare
also
the
case
in
ireland
gaelic
names
in
orkney
and
shetland
in
their
norse
form
have
already
been
dealt
with
the
blending
of
norse
and
gael
in
the
hebrides
does
not
appear
to
have
been
more
successful
than
in
orkney
since
we
find
in
that
earl
rögnvaldr
said
that
most
suðreyingar
were
untrue
and
even
sveinn
ásleifarson
put
little
faith
in
them
the
use
of
norse
names
and
patronymics
by
the
leading
gaels
in
caithness
who
are
alone
mentioned
in
the
saga
is
accounted
for
by
the
fashion
set
by
their
norse
earls
as
well
as
through
the
influence
of
norse
marriages
while
the
leading
people
must
have
been
bilingual
speaking
norse
the
court
language
and
gaelic
the
or
common
people
appear
to
have
maintained
their
native
gaelic
this
is
indicated
in
two
striking
instances
in
the
saga
in
earls
haraldr
and
rögnvaldr
went
from
up
and
took
night
quarters
at
some
which
call
the
local
gaelic
name
of
such
a
shieling
was
ir
in
earl
haraldr
who
was
living
at
víkr
dispersed
his
men
quartered
them
on
various
houses
in
accordance
with
the
obligations
of
the
householders
during
páskar
easter
then
the
katnesingar
said
that
the
earl
was
on
vigfússon
suggested
that
this
word
was
some
corrupt
form
of
a
local
name
dasent
translated
it
and
goudie
which
is
correct
as
must
be
gaelic
a
messing
eating
together
ir
gaelic
a
supper
a
party
to
which
everyone
brings
his
own
provisions
ir
quartering
in
both
these
cases
the
ir
spelling
comes
nearer
to
the
norse
than
the
scottish
gaelic
does
and
corresponds
to
the
scottish
gaelic
of
the
twelfth
century
the
fact
that
the
earl
had
the
right
to
quarter
his
men
in
orkney
and
shetland
is
preserved
in
the
tax
which
was
paid
in
lieu
of
actual
entertainment
this
tax
continues
to
be
paid
to
this
day
inhabitants
of
orkney
and
shetland
after
will
be
the
subject
of
a
future
paper
meanwhile
it
may
be
emphasised
that
the
gaelic
earls
of
orkney
failed
in
the
male
line
before
the
scots
began
to
assume
permanent
surnames
the
gaelic
earls
were
succeeded
in
the
female
line
by
the
family
of
clair
bearing
a
hereditary
surname
about
the
time
of
whose
arrival
began
the
settlement
of
orkney
to
the
influence
of
which
must
be
attributed
the
assumption
of
the
lowland
scottish
language
and
the
adoption
of
and
not
fixed
patronymics
in
orkney
by
the
inhabitants
shetland
being
far
removed
from
the
seat
of
government
and
fashion
continued
the
use
of
patronymics
until
the
nineteenth
century
when
they
became
fixed
the
great
number
of
persons
in
orkney
and
shetland
bearing
the
names
of
tulloch
and
sinclair
appears
to
indicate
that
the
ancestors
of
some
of
them
may
have
been
tenants
of
the
bishopric
and
earldom
who
in
accordance
with
gaelic
custom
assumed
the
names
of
their
lords
of
that
ilk
the
tulloch
bishops
ruled
and
the
sinclair
earls
and
lessees
the
period
during
which
patronymics
were
giving
place
to
hereditary
surnames
in
orkney
tulloch
and
sinclair
may
also
have
been
christian
names
which
became
stereotyped
as
patronymics
and
the
termination
afterwards
dropped
as
in
the
case
of
omondson
omond
shetlanders
pride
themselves
in
their
geographic
detachment
from
orkney
with
its
scottish
people
and
customs
and
claim
to
be
regarded
as
purer
norsemen
as
compared
with
the
scots
of
orkney
perhaps
it
is
owing
to
this
qualified
humdrum
purity
that
the
shetlanders
did
not
achieve
any
deeds
of
sufficient
interest
to
be
recorded
in
the
saga
however
from
an
anthropological
point
of
view
the
pictish
and
small
dark
strain
is
as
much
in
evidence
in
shetland
as
in
orkney
and
perhaps
more
so
in
the
twelfth
century
even
an
ordinary
shetland
farmer
had
his
thrall
and
giving
a
thrall
his
freedom
is
mentioned
as
an
ordinary
transaction
the
thrall
element
must
therefore
have
formed
a
large
proportion
of
the
population
and
intermarriage
must
have
taken
place
between
the
norse
and
the
thralls
we
find
the
earls
had
children
by
thralls
and
intermarriage
between
the
bœndr
and
thralls
especially
the
freed
thralls
must
also
have
taken
place
persons
of
mixed
racial
descent
are
usually
very
loud
in
an
exaggerated
appreciation
of
the
heroic
line
of
their
ancestry
especially
when
it
is
on
the
distaff
side
usually
coupled
with
an
inverse
depreciation
of
the
other
ascent
which
is
represented
by
an
inappropriate
and
inconvenient
surname
there
would
be
no
necessity
for
a
genuine
norse
islander
to
crow
himself
hoarse
on
his
native
rock
and
to
do
so
would
indicate
that
there
were
grave
doubts
as
to
the
purity
of
his
strain
hitherto
the
norse
traditions
of
orkney
and
shetland
have
been
solely
espoused
by
outlanders
and
by
natives
bearing
surnames
which
leave
no
doubt
as
to
their
foreign
origin
the
most
voluminous
history
of
shetland
was
written
by
an
english
tourist
hibbert
afterwards
hibbert
ware
but
then
the
english
are
noted
for
their
greater
interest
in
the
history
and
antiquities
of
countries
other
than
their
own
which
may
be
accounted
for
by
the
exceptional
variety
of
races
which
they
represent
but
after
all
the
land
makes
the
man
if
it
had
not
been
for
these
northern
islands
there
would
have
been
no
with
its
verses
and
narratives
of
stirring
events
