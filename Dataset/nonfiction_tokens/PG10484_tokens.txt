by

greek
and
roman
jurisprudence
there
is
not
much
in
ancient
governments
and
laws
to
interest
us
except
such
as
were
in
harmony
with
natural
justice
and
were
designed
for
the
welfare
of
all
classes
in
the
state
a
jurisprudence
founded
on
the
edicts
of
absolute
kings
or
on
the
regulations
of
a
priestly
caste
is
necessarily
partial
and
may
be
unenlightened
but
those
laws
which
are
gradually
enacted
for
the
interests
of
the
whole
body
of
the
people
for
the
rich
and
poor
the
powerful
and
feeble
alike
have
generally
been
the
result
of
great
and
diverse
experiences
running
through
centuries
the
work
of
wise
men
under
constitutional
forms
of
government
the
jurisprudence
of
nations
based
on
equity
is
a
growth
or
development
according
to
public
wants
and
necessities
especially
in
countries
having
popular
liberty
and
rights
as
in
england
and
the
united
states
we
do
not
find
in
the
history
of
ancient
nations
such
a
jurisprudence
except
in
the
free
states
of
greece
and
among
the
romans
who
had
a
natural
genius
or
aptitude
for
government
and
where
the
people
had
a
powerful
influence
in
legislation
until
even
the
name
of
liberty
was
not
invoked
among
the
egyptians
assyrians
and
babylonians
the
only
laws
were
the
edicts
of
kings
or
the
regulations
of
priests
mostly
made
with
a
view
of
cementing
their
own
power
except
those
that
were
dictated
by
benevolence
or
the
pressing
needs
of
the
people
who
were
ground
down
and
oppressed
and
protected
only
as
slaves
were
once
protected
in
the
southern
states
of
america
wise
and
good
monarchs
doubtless
issued
decrees
for
the
benefit
of
all
classes
such
as
conscience
or
knowledge
dictated
whenever
they
felt
their
great
responsibilities
as
in
some
of
the
absolute
monarchies
of
europe
but
they
never
issued
their
decrees
at
the
suggestions
or
demands
of
those
classes
for
whom
the
laws
were
made
the
voice
of
the
people
was
ignored
except
so
far
as
it
moved
the
pity
or
appealed
to
the
hearts
and
consciences
of
their
rulers
the
people
had
and
claimed
no
the
only
men
to
whom
rulers
listened
or
by
whom
they
were
controlled
were
those
whom
they
chose
as
counsellors
and
ministers
who
were
supposed
to
advise
with
a
view
to
the
sovereign
benefit
and
that
of
the
empire
generally
the
same
may
be
said
in
general
of
other
oriental
monarchies
especially
when
embarked
in
aggressive
wars
where
the
will
of
the
monarch
was
supreme
and
unresisted
as
in
persia
in
india
and
china
the
government
was
not
so
absolute
since
it
was
checked
by
feudatory
princes
almost
independent
like
the
feudal
barons
and
dukes
of
mediaeval
europe
nor
was
there
probably
among
oriental
nations
any
elaborate
codification
of
the
decrees
and
laws
as
in
greece
and
rome
except
by
the
priests
for
their
ritual
service
like
that
which
marked
the
jurisprudence
of
the
israelites
there
were
laws
against
murder
theft
adultery
and
other
offences
since
society
can
not
exist
anywhere
without
such
laws
but
there
was
no
complicated
jurisprudence
produced
by
the
friction
of
competing
classes
striving
for
justice
and
right
or
even
for
the
interests
of
contending
parties
we
do
not
look
to
egypt
or
to
china
for
wise
punishment
of
ordinary
crimes
but
we
do
look
to
greece
and
rome
and
to
rome
especially
for
a
legislation
which
shall
balance
the
complicated
relations
of
society
on
principles
of
enlightened
reason
moreover
those
great
popular
rights
which
we
now
most
zealously
defend
have
generally
been
extorted
in
the
strife
of
classes
and
parties
sometimes
from
kings
and
sometimes
from
princes
and
nobles
where
there
has
been
no
opposition
to
absolutism
these
rights
have
not
been
secured
but
whenever
and
wherever
the
people
have
been
a
power
they
have
imperiously
made
their
wants
known
and
so
far
as
they
have
been
reasonable
they
have
been
finally
secured
perhaps
after
angry
expostulations
and
disputations
now
it
is
this
kind
of
legislation
which
is
remarkable
in
the
history
of
greece
and
rome
secured
by
a
combination
of
the
people
against
the
ruling
classes
in
the
interests
of
justice
and
the
common
welfare
and
finally
endorsed
and
upheld
even
by
monarchs
themselves
it
is
from
this
legislation
that
modern
nations
have
learned
wisdom
for
a
permanent
law
in
a
free
country
may
be
the
result
of
a
hundred
years
of
discussion
or
contention
a
compromise
of
parties
a
lesson
in
human
experience
as
the
laws
of
greece
and
rome
alone
among
the
ancients
are
rich
in
moral
wisdom
and
adapted
more
or
less
to
all
nations
and
ages
in
the
struggle
for
equal
rights
and
wise
social
regulations
i
shall
confine
myself
to
them
besides
i
aim
not
to
give
useless
and
curious
details
but
to
show
how
far
in
general
the
enlightened
nations
of
antiquity
made
attainments
in
those
things
which
we
call
civilization
and
particularly
in
that
great
department
which
concerns
so
nearly
all
human
interests
that
of
the
regulation
of
mutual
social
relations
and
this
by
modes
and
with
results
which
have
had
their
direct
influence
upon
our
modern
times
when
we
consider
the
native
genius
of
the
greeks
and
their
marvellous
achievements
in
philosophy
literature
and
art
we
are
surprised
that
they
were
so
inferior
to
the
romans
in
jurisprudence
although
in
the
early
days
of
the
roman
republic
a
deputation
of
citizens
was
sent
to
athens
to
study
the
laws
of
solon
but
neither
nations
nor
individuals
are
great
in
everything
before
solon
lived
lycurgus
had
given
laws
to
the
spartans
this
lawgiver
one
of
the
descendants
of
hercules
was
born
according
to
grote
about
eight
hundred
and
eighty
years
before
christ
and
was
the
uncle
of
the
reigning
king
there
is
however
no
certainty
as
to
the
time
when
he
lived
it
was
probably
about
the
period
when
carthage
was
founded
by
the
phoenicians
he
instituted
the
spartan
senate
and
gave
an
aristocratic
form
to
the
constitution
but
the
senate
composed
of
about
thirty
old
men
who
acted
in
conjunction
with
the
two
kings
did
not
differ
materially
from
the
council
of
chiefs
or
old
men
found
in
other
ancient
grecian
states
the
spartan
chiefs
simply
modified
or
curtailed
the
power
of
the
kings
in
the
course
of
time
the
senate
with
the
kings
included
in
it
became
the
governing
body
of
the
state
and
this
oligarchical
form
of
government
lasted
several
hundred
years
we
know
but
little
of
the
especial
laws
given
by
lycurgus
we
know
the
distinctions
of
society
citizens
and
helots
and
their
mutual
relations
the
distribution
of
lands
to
check
luxury
the
public
men
the
public
training
of
youth
the
severe
discipline
to
which
all
were
subjected
the
cruelty
exercised
towards
slaves
the
attention
given
to
gymnastic
exercises
and
athletic
sports
in
short
the
habits
and
customs
of
the
people
rather
than
any
regular
system
of
jurisprudence
lycurgus
was
the
trainer
of
a
military
brotherhood
rather
than
a
under
his
régime
the
citizen
belonged
to
the
state
rather
than
to
his
family
and
all
the
ends
of
the
state
were
warlike
rather
than
peaceful
not
looking
to
the
settlement
of
quarrels
on
principles
of
equity
or
a
development
of
industrial
interests
which
are
the
great
aims
of
modern
legislation
the
influence
of
the
athenian
solon
on
the
laws
which
affected
individuals
is
more
apparent
than
that
of
the
spartan
lycurgus
the
earliest
of
the
grecian
legislators
but
solon
had
a
predecessor
in
athens
itself
draco
who
in
was
appointed
to
reduce
to
writing
the
arbitrary
decisions
of
the
archons
thus
giving
a
form
of
permanent
law
and
a
basis
for
a
court
of
appeal
draco
laws
were
extraordinarily
severe
punishing
small
thefts
and
even
laziness
with
death
the
formulation
of
any
system
of
justice
would
have
as
draco
did
a
beneficial
influence
on
the
growth
of
the
state
but
the
severity
of
these
bloody
laws
caused
them
to
be
hated
and
in
practice
neglected
until
solon
arose
solon
was
born
in
athens
about
and
belonged
to
the
noblest
family
of
the
state
he
was
contemporary
with
pisistratus
and
thales
his
father
having
lost
his
property
solon
applied
himself
to
merchandise
always
a
respectable
calling
in
a
mercantile
city
he
first
became
known
as
a
writer
of
love
poems
then
came
into
prominence
as
a
successful
military
commander
of
volunteer
forces
in
a
disastrous
war
and
at
last
he
gained
the
confidence
of
his
countrymen
so
completely
that
in
a
period
of
anarchy
distress
and
mutiny
the
poor
being
so
grievously
oppressed
by
the
rich
that
a
sixth
part
of
the
produce
of
land
went
to
the
landlord
he
was
chosen
archon
with
authority
to
revise
the
laws
and
might
have
made
himself
king
he
abolished
the
custom
of
selling
the
body
of
a
debtor
for
debt
and
even
annulled
debts
in
a
state
of
general
distress
which
did
not
please
the
rich
nor
even
the
poor
since
they
desired
a
redivision
of
lands
such
as
lycurgus
had
made
in
sparta
he
repealed
the
severe
laws
of
draco
which
inflicted
capital
punishment
for
so
many
small
offences
retaining
the
extreme
penalty
only
for
murder
and
treason
in
order
further
to
promote
the
interests
of
the
people
he
empowered
any
man
whatever
to
enter
an
action
for
one
that
was
injured
he
left
the
great
offices
of
state
however
in
the
hands
of
the
rich
giving
the
people
a
share
in
those
which
were
not
so
important
he
the
council
of
the
areopagus
composed
of
those
who
had
been
archons
and
nine
were
appointed
annually
for
the
general
guardianship
of
the
laws
but
he
instituted
another
court
or
senate
of
four
hundred
citizens
for
the
cognizance
of
all
matters
before
they
were
submitted
to
the
higher
court
although
the
poorest
and
most
numerous
class
were
not
eligible
for
office
they
had
the
right
of
suffrage
and
could
vote
for
the
principal
officers
it
would
at
first
seem
that
the
legislation
of
solon
gave
especial
privileges
to
the
rich
but
it
is
generally
understood
that
he
was
the
founder
of
the
democracy
of
athens
he
gave
the
athenians
not
the
best
possible
code
but
the
best
they
were
capable
of
receiving
he
intended
to
give
to
the
people
as
much
power
as
was
strictly
needed
and
no
more
but
in
a
free
state
the
people
continually
encroach
on
the
privileges
of
the
rich
and
thus
gradually
the
chief
power
falls
into
their
hands
whatever
the
power
which
solon
gave
to
the
people
and
however
great
their
subsequent
encroachments
it
can
not
be
doubted
that
he
was
the
first
to
lay
the
foundations
of
constitutional
government
that
is
one
in
which
the
people
took
part
in
legislation
and
in
the
election
of
rulers
the
greatest
benefit
which
he
conferred
on
the
state
was
in
the
laws
which
gave
relief
to
poor
debtors
those
which
enabled
people
to
protect
themselves
by
constitutional
means
and
those
which
prohibited
fathers
from
selling
their
daughters
and
sisters
for
slaves
an
abomination
which
had
long
disgraced
the
athenian
republic
some
of
solon
laws
were
of
questionable
utility
he
prohibited
the
exportation
of
the
fruits
of
the
soil
in
attica
with
the
exception
of
alone
a
regulation
difficult
to
be
enforced
in
a
mercantile
state
neither
would
he
grant
citizenship
to
immigrants
and
he
released
sons
from
supporting
their
parents
in
old
age
if
the
parents
had
neglected
to
give
them
a
trade
he
encouraged
all
developments
of
national
industries
knowing
that
the
wealth
of
the
state
depended
on
them
solon
was
the
first
athenian
legislator
who
granted
the
power
of
testamentary
bequests
when
a
man
had
no
legitimate
children
sons
succeeded
to
the
property
of
their
parents
with
the
obligation
of
giving
a
marriage
dowry
to
their
sisters
if
there
were
no
sons
the
daughters
inherited
the
property
of
their
parents
but
a
person
who
had
no
children
could
bequeath
his
property
to
whom
he
pleased
solon
prohibited
costly
sacrifices
at
funerals
he
forbade
of
the
dead
and
indeed
of
all
persons
before
judges
and
archons
he
pronounced
a
man
infamous
who
took
part
in
a
sedition
when
this
enlightened
and
disinterested
man
had
finished
his
work
of
legislation
he
visited
egypt
and
cyprus
and
devoted
his
leisure
to
the
composition
of
poems
he
also
it
is
said
when
a
prisoner
in
the
hands
of
the
persians
visited
croesus
the
rich
king
of
lydia
and
gave
to
him
an
admonitory
lesson
on
the
vicissitudes
of
life
after
a
prolonged
absence
solon
returned
to
athens
about
the
time
of
the
usurpation
of
his
kinsman
peisistratus
who
however
suffered
the
aged
legislator
and
patriot
to
go
unharmed
and
even
allowed
most
of
his
laws
to
remain
in
force
the
constitution
and
laws
of
athens
continued
substantially
for
about
a
hundred
years
after
the
archonship
of
solon
when
the
democratic
party
under
cleisthenes
gained
complete
ascendency
some
modification
of
the
laws
was
then
made
the
political
franchise
was
extended
to
all
free
native
athenians
the
command
of
the
military
forces
was
given
to
ten
generals
one
from
each
tribe
instead
of
being
intrusted
to
one
of
the
archons
the
ecclesia
a
formal
assembly
of
the
citizens
met
more
frequently
the
people
were
called
into
direct
action
as
or
jurors
all
citizens
were
eligible
to
the
magistracy
even
to
the
archonship
ostracism
which
virtually
was
exile
without
disgrace
became
a
political
necessity
to
check
the
ascendency
of
demagogues
such
were
the
main
features
of
the
constitution
and
jurisprudence
of
athens
when
the
struggle
between
the
patricians
and
plebeians
of
rome
began
to
which
we
now
give
our
attention
it
was
the
real
beginning
of
constitutional
liberty
in
rome
before
this
time
the
government
was
in
the
hands
either
of
kings
or
aristocrats
the
patricians
were
descendants
of
the
original
latin
sabine
and
etruscan
families
the
plebeians
were
the
throng
of
common
folk
brought
in
by
conquest
or
later
immigration
mostly
of
latin
origin
the
senate
was
the
ruling
power
after
the
expulsion
of
the
kings
and
senators
were
selected
from
the
great
patrician
families
who
controlled
by
their
wealth
and
influence
the
popular
elections
the
army
and
navy
and
all
foreign
relations
consuls
the
highest
magistrates
who
commanded
the
armies
were
annually
elected
by
the
people
but
for
several
centuries
the
consuls
belonged
to
great
families
the
constitution
was
essentially
aristocratic
and
the
aristocracy
was
based
on
wealth
power
was
in
the
hands
of
nobles
whether
their
ancestors
were
patricians
or
plebeians
although
in
the
early
ages
of
the
republic
they
were
mostly
patricians
by
birth
but
with
the
growth
of
rome
new
families
that
were
not
descended
from
the
ancient
tribes
became
prominent
like
the
claudii
the
julii
and
the
servilii
and
were
incorporated
with
the
nobility
there
are
very
few
names
in
roman
history
before
the
time
of
marius
which
did
not
belong
to
this
noble
class
the
or
common
people
had
at
first
no
political
privileges
whatever
not
even
the
right
of
suffrage
and
were
not
allowed
to
marry
into
patrician
rank
indeed
they
were
politically
and
socially
oppressed
the
first
great
event
which
gave
the
plebs
protection
and
political
importance
was
the
appointment
of
representatives
called
tribunes
of
the
people
a
privilege
extorted
from
the
patricians
the
tribunes
had
the
right
to
be
present
at
the
deliberations
of
the
senate
their
persons
were
inviolable
and
they
had
the
power
of
veto
over
obnoxious
laws
their
power
continually
increased
until
they
were
finally
elected
from
the
senatorial
body
in
the
plebs
had
gained
sufficient
influence
to
establish
the
by
which
they
were
allowed
to
intermarry
with
patricians
in
the
same
year
they
were
admitted
to
the
quaestorship
which
office
entitled
the
possessor
to
a
seat
in
the
senate
the
quaestors
had
charge
of
the
public
money
in
the
plebeians
obtained
the
praetorship
a
judicial
office
in
the
year
the
distinctions
vanished
between
plebeians
and
patricians
and
the
term
instead
of
was
applied
to
all
roman
people
alike
originally
the
comprised
strictly
roman
citizens
those
who
belonged
to
the
original
tribes
and
who
had
the
right
of
suffrage
when
the
plebeians
obtained
access
to
the
great
offices
of
the
state
the
senate
represented
the
whole
people
as
it
formerly
represented
the
and
the
term
was
enlarged
to
embrace
the
entire
community
the
senate
was
an
august
body
and
was
very
powerful
it
was
both
judicial
and
legislative
and
for
several
centuries
was
composed
of
patricians
alone
its
members
always
belonged
to
the
aristocracy
whether
of
patrician
or
plebeian
descent
and
were
supposed
to
be
rich
under
augustus
it
required
one
million
two
hundred
thousand
sesterces
annually
to
support
the
senatorial
dignity
the
senate
the
members
of
which
were
chosen
for
life
had
the
superintendence
of
matters
of
religion
and
foreign
relations
it
commanded
the
levies
of
troops
it
regulated
duties
and
taxes
it
gave
audience
to
ambassadors
it
determined
upon
the
way
that
war
should
be
conducted
it
decreed
to
what
provinces
governors
should
be
sent
it
declared
martial
law
in
the
appointment
of
dictators
and
it
decreed
triumphs
to
fortunate
generals
the
senators
as
a
badge
of
distinction
wore
upon
their
tunics
a
broad
purple
stripe
and
they
had
the
privilege
of
the
best
seats
in
the
theatres
their
decisions
were
laws
leges
a
large
part
of
them
had
held
curule
offices
which
entitled
them
to
a
seat
in
the
senate
for
life
the
curule
officers
were
the
consuls
the
praetors
the
aediles
the
quaestors
the
tribunes
so
that
an
able
senator
was
sure
of
a
great
office
in
the
course
of
his
life
a
man
could
scarcely
be
a
senator
unless
he
had
held
a
great
office
nor
could
he
often
have
held
a
great
office
unless
he
were
a
senator
thus
it
would
seem
that
the
roman
constitution
for
three
hundred
years
after
the
expulsion
of
the
kings
was
essentially
aristocratic
the
had
but
small
consideration
till
the
time
of
the
gracchi
but
after
the
institution
of
tribunes
a
change
in
the
constitution
gradually
took
place
so
that
it
was
neither
aristocratic
nor
popular
exclusively
but
was
composed
of
both
elements
and
was
a
system
of
balance
of
power
between
the
various
classes
the
more
complete
the
balance
of
power
the
closer
is
the
resemblance
to
a
constitutional
government
when
one
class
acted
as
a
check
against
another
class
as
gradually
came
to
pass
until
the
subversion
of
liberties
by
successful
generals
the
senate
the
magistrates
and
the
people
in
their
assemblies
shared
between
them
the
political
power
but
the
senate
had
a
preponderating
influence
the
judicial
the
legislative
and
the
executive
authority
was
as
well
defined
in
roman
legislation
as
it
is
in
english
or
american
no
person
was
above
the
authority
of
the
laws
no
one
class
could
subvert
the
liberties
and
prerogatives
of
another
class
even
the
senate
could
not
override
the
constitution
the
consuls
elected
by
the
centuries
presided
over
the
senate
and
over
the
assemblies
of
the
people
there
was
no
absolute
power
exercised
at
rome
until
the
subversion
of
the
constitution
except
by
dictators
chosen
by
the
senate
in
times
of
imminent
danger
nor
could
senators
elect
members
of
their
own
body
the
censors
alone
had
the
right
of
electing
from
the
and
of
excluding
such
as
were
unworthy
the
consuls
could
remain
in
office
but
a
year
and
could
be
called
to
account
when
their
terms
of
office
had
expired
the
tribunes
of
the
people
ultimately
could
prevent
a
consul
from
convening
the
senate
could
seize
a
consul
and
imprison
him
and
could
veto
an
ordinance
of
the
senate
itself
the
nobles
had
no
exclusive
privilege
like
the
feudal
aristocracy
of
mediaeval
europe
although
it
was
their
aim
to
secure
the
high
magistracies
to
the
members
of
their
own
body
the
term
implied
that
some
one
of
a
man
ancestors
had
filled
a
curule
magistracy
a
patrician
long
before
the
reforms
of
the
gracchi
had
become
a
man
of
secondary
importance
but
the
nobles
were
aristocrats
to
the
close
of
the
republic
and
continued
to
secure
the
highest
offices
they
prevented
their
own
extinction
by
admitting
into
their
ranks
those
who
distinguished
themselves
that
is
exercising
their
influence
in
the
popular
elections
to
secure
the
magistracies
from
among
themselves
the
roman
constitution
then
as
gradually
developed
by
the
necessities
and
crises
that
arose
which
i
have
not
space
to
mention
was
a
wonderful
monument
of
human
wisdom
the
nobility
were
very
powerful
from
their
wealth
and
influence
but
the
people
were
not
ground
down
there
were
no
oppressive
laws
to
reduce
them
to
practical
slavery
what
rights
they
gained
they
retained
they
constantly
extorted
new
privileges
until
they
were
sufficiently
powerful
to
be
courted
by
demagogues
it
was
the
demagogues
generally
aristocratic
ones
like
catiline
and
caesar
who
subverted
the
liberties
of
the
people
by
buying
votes
but
for
nearly
five
hundred
years
not
a
man
arose
whom
the
roman
people
feared
and
the
proud
symbol
spqr
on
the
standards
of
the
armies
of
the
republic
bore
the
name
of
the
roman
senate
and
people
to
the
ends
of
the
earth
when
however
the
senate
came
to
be
made
up
of
men
whom
the
great
generals
selected
when
the
tribunes
played
into
the
hands
of
the
very
men
they
were
created
to
oppose
when
the
of
a
people
originally
religious
was
chosen
politically
and
without
regard
to
moral
or
religious
consideration
when
aristocratic
nobles
left
their
own
ranks
to
steal
the
few
offices
which
the
people
controlled
then
the
constitution
under
which
the
romans
had
advanced
to
the
conquest
of
the
world
became
subverted
and
the
empire
was
a
consolidated
despotism
under
the
emperors
there
was
no
constitution
since
they
combined
in
their
own
persons
all
the
great
offices
of
state
and
controlled
the
senate
the
army
the
tribunals
of
the
law
the
distant
provinces
the
city
itself
and
regulated
taxes
and
imposed
burdens
as
they
pleased
the
senate
lost
its
independence
the
courts
their
justice
the
army
its
spirit
and
the
people
their
hopes
and
yet
the
old
forms
remained
the
senate
met
as
in
the
days
of
the
gracchi
and
there
were
consuls
and
praetors
as
before
however
much
we
may
deplore
the
subversion
of
the
roman
constitution
and
the
absolute
reign
of
the
emperors
in
which
most
historians
see
a
political
necessity
there
was
yet
under
these
emperors
whether
good
or
bad
the
reign
of
law
the
bequest
of
five
hundred
years
experience
the
emperors
reigned
despotically
but
under
the
forms
of
legislation
nor
did
they
attempt
to
subvert
laws
which
did
not
interfere
with
their
own
political
power
what
is
called
jurisprudence
they
even
improved
as
that
later
imperial
despot
napoleon
gave
a
code
to
the
nation
he
ruled
it
is
this
science
of
jurisprudence
for
which
the
romans
had
a
genius
that
gives
them
their
highest
claim
to
be
ranked
among
the
benefactors
of
mankind
they
created
legal
science
its
aim
was
justice
equity
in
the
relations
between
man
and
man
this
was
the
pride
of
the
roman
world
even
under
the
rule
of
tyrants
and
madmen
and
this
has
survived
all
the
calamities
of
fifteen
hundred
years
the
roman
laws
founded
by
the
republic
but
symmetrically
completed
by
the
empire
have
more
powerfully
affected
the
interests
of
civilization
than
have
the
philosophy
and
arts
of
greece
roman
jurisprudence
was
not
perfectly
developed
until
five
hundred
years
after
the
christian
era
when
justinian
consolidated
it
into
the
code
the
pandects
and
the
institutes
the
classical
jurists
like
gaius
ulpian
and
paulus
may
have
laid
the
foundation
but
the
superstructure
was
raised
under
the
auspices
of
the
imperial
despots
the
earliest
code
of
roman
laws
was
called
the
twelve
tables
framed
from
the
report
of
the
commissioners
sent
to
athens
and
other
greek
states
to
collect
what
was
most
useful
in
their
legal
systems
the
laws
of
the
twelve
tables
were
the
basis
of
all
the
roman
laws
civil
and
religious
but
the
edicts
of
the
praetors
who
were
the
great
equity
judges
as
well
as
the
magistrates
proclaimed
certain
changes
which
custom
and
the
practice
of
the
courts
had
introduced
and
these
added
to
the
or
laws
proposed
by
the
consul
and
passed
by
the
centuries
the
or
laws
proposed
by
the
tribunes
and
passed
by
the
tribes
and
the
consulta
or
decrees
of
the
senate
gradually
swelled
the
laws
to
a
great
number
three
thousand
engraved
plates
of
brass
containing
these
various
laws
were
deposited
in
the
capitol
subtleties
and
fictions
were
in
the
course
of
litigations
introduced
by
the
lawyers
to
defeat
the
written
statutes
and
jurisprudence
became
complicated
as
early
as
the
time
of
cicero
even
the
opinions
of
eminent
lawyers
were
adopted
by
the
legal
profession
as
authoritative
and
were
recognized
by
the
courts
the
evils
of
a
complicated
jurisprudence
were
so
evident
in
the
seventh
century
of
the
city
that
mucius
scaevola
a
great
lawyer
when
consul
published
a
scientific
elaboration
of
the
civil
law
cicero
studied
law
under
him
and
his
contemporaries
varus
and
aelius
gallus
wrote
learned
treatises
from
which
extracts
appear
in
the
digest
made
under
the
emperor
justinian
julius
caesar
contemplated
a
complete
revision
of
the
laws
but
did
not
live
long
enough
to
carry
out
his
intentions
his
legislation
so
far
as
he
directed
his
mind
to
it
was
very
just
among
other
laws
established
by
him
was
one
which
ordained
that
creditors
should
accept
lands
as
payment
for
their
outstanding
debts
according
to
the
value
determined
by
commissioners
in
his
time
the
relative
value
of
money
had
changed
and
was
greatly
diminished
the
most
important
law
of
augustus
deserving
of
all
praise
was
that
which
related
to
the
manumission
of
slaves
but
he
did
not
interfere
with
the
social
relations
of
the
people
after
he
had
deprived
them
of
political
liberty
he
once
attempted
by
his
to
counteract
the
custom
which
then
prevailed
of
abstaining
from
legal
marriage
and
substituting
concubinage
instead
by
which
the
free
population
declined
but
this
attempt
to
improve
the
morals
of
the
people
met
with
such
opposition
from
the
tribes
and
centuries
that
the
next
emperor
abolished
popular
assemblies
altogether
which
augustus
had
feared
to
do
the
senate
in
the
time
of
the
emperors
composed
chiefly
of
lawyers
and
magistrates
and
entirely
dependent
upon
them
became
the
great
fountain
of
law
by
the
original
constitution
the
people
were
the
source
of
power
and
the
senate
merely
gave
or
refused
its
approbation
to
the
laws
proposed
but
under
the
emperors
the
or
popular
assemblies
disappeared
and
the
senate
passed
decrees
which
had
the
force
of
laws
subject
to
the
veto
of
the
emperor
it
was
not
until
the
time
of
septimus
severus
and
caracalla
second
century
that
the
legislative
action
of
the
senate
ceased
and
the
edicts
and
rescripts
of
emperors
took
the
place
of
all
legislation
the
golden
age
of
roman
jurisprudence
was
from
the
birth
of
cicero
to
the
reign
of
the
emperor
alexander
severus
before
this
period
it
was
an
occult
science
confined
to
praetors
pontiffs
and
patrician
lawyers
but
in
the
latter
days
of
the
republic
law
became
the
fashionable
study
of
roman
youth
and
eminent
masters
arose
the
first
great
lawyer
who
left
behind
him
important
works
was
mucius
scaevola
who
wrote
a
treatise
in
eighteen
books
on
the
civil
law
he
was
says
cicero
the
most
eloquent
of
jurists
and
the
most
learned
of
orators
this
work
george
long
thinks
had
a
great
influence
on
contemporaries
and
on
subsequent
jurists
who
followed
it
as
a
model
it
is
the
oldest
work
from
which
there
are
any
excerpts
in
the
digest
servius
sulpicius
the
friend
of
cicero
and
his
in
oratory
surpassed
his
teachers
balbus
and
gallus
and
was
the
equal
in
reputation
of
the
great
mucius
scaevola
the
pontifex
maximus
who
said
it
was
disgraceful
for
a
patrician
and
a
noble
to
be
ignorant
of
the
law
with
which
he
had
to
do
cicero
ascribes
the
great
superiority
of
servius
as
a
lawyer
to
the
study
of
philosophy
which
disciplined
and
developed
his
mind
and
enabled
him
to
deduce
his
conclusions
from
his
premises
with
logical
precision
he
left
behind
him
one
hundred
and
eighty
treatises
and
had
numerous
pupils
among
whom
ofilius
and
alfenus
varus
cato
julius
caesar
antony
and
cicero
were
great
lawyers
labeo
in
the
time
of
augustus
wrote
four
hundred
books
on
jurisprudence
spending
six
months
in
the
year
in
giving
instruction
to
his
pupils
and
in
answering
legal
questions
and
the
other
six
months
in
the
country
in
writing
books
like
all
the
great
roman
jurists
he
was
versed
in
literature
and
philosophy
and
so
devoted
to
his
profession
that
he
refused
political
office
his
rival
capito
was
equally
learned
in
all
departments
of
the
law
and
left
behind
him
as
many
treatises
as
labeo
these
two
jurists
were
the
founders
of
celebrated
schools
like
the
ancient
philosophers
and
each
had
distinguished
followers
gaius
who
flourished
in
the
time
of
the
antonines
was
a
great
legal
authority
and
the
recent
discovery
of
his
institutes
has
revealed
the
least
mutilated
fragment
of
roman
jurisprudence
which
exists
and
one
of
the
most
valuable
which
sheds
great
light
on
ancient
roman
law
it
was
found
in
the
library
of
verona
no
roman
jurist
had
a
higher
reputation
than
papinian
who
was
praefectus
praetorio
under
septimius
severus
an
office
which
made
him
second
only
to
the
emperor
a
sort
of
grand
vizier
whose
power
extended
over
all
departments
of
the
state
he
was
beheaded
by
caracalla
the
great
commentator
cujacius
declares
that
he
was
the
first
of
all
lawyers
who
have
been
or
who
are
to
be
that
no
one
ever
surpassed
him
in
legal
knowledge
and
no
one
will
ever
equal
him
paulus
was
his
contemporary
and
held
the
same
office
as
papinian
he
was
the
most
fertile
of
roman
and
there
is
more
taken
from
him
in
justinian
digest
than
from
any
other
jurist
except
ulpian
there
are
two
thousand
and
excerpts
from
this
writer
one
sixth
of
the
whole
digest
no
legal
writer
ancient
or
modern
has
handled
so
many
subjects
in
perspicuity
he
is
said
to
be
inferior
to
ulpian
one
of
the
most
famous
of
jurists
who
was
his
contemporary
ulpian
has
also
exercised
a
great
influence
on
modern
jurisprudence
from
the
copious
extracts
of
his
writings
in
the
digest
he
was
the
chief
adviser
of
alexander
severus
and
like
paulus
was
praefectus
praetorio
the
number
of
excerpts
in
the
digest
from
him
is
said
to
be
two
thousand
four
hundred
and
and
they
form
a
third
part
of
it
some
fragments
of
his
writings
remain
the
last
of
the
great
civilians
associated
with
gaius
papinian
paulus
and
ulpian
as
oracles
of
jurisprudence
was
modestinus
who
was
a
pupil
of
ulpian
he
wrote
both
in
greek
and
latin
there
are
three
hundred
and
excerpts
in
the
digest
from
his
writings
the
titles
of
which
show
the
extent
and
variety
of
his
labors
these
eminent
lawyers
shed
great
glory
on
the
roman
civilization
in
the
earliest
times
men
sought
distinction
on
the
fields
of
battle
but
in
the
latter
days
of
the
republic
honor
was
conferred
for
forensic
ability
the
first
pleaders
of
rome
were
not
jurisconsults
but
aristocratic
patrons
who
looked
after
their
clients
men
of
lower
social
grade
who
in
return
for
protection
and
assistance
rendered
service
sometimes
political
by
voting
sometimes
pecuniary
sometimes
military
but
when
law
became
complicated
a
class
of
men
arose
to
interpret
it
these
men
were
held
in
great
honor
and
reached
by
their
services
the
highest
offices
like
cicero
and
hortensius
no
remuneration
was
given
originally
for
forensic
pleading
beyond
the
services
which
the
client
gave
to
a
patron
but
gradually
the
practice
of
the
law
became
lucrative
hortensius
as
well
as
cicero
gained
an
immense
fortune
he
had
several
villas
a
gallery
of
paintings
a
large
stock
of
wines
parks
and
aviaries
cicero
had
villas
in
all
parts
of
italy
a
house
on
the
palatine
with
columns
of
numidian
marble
and
a
fortune
of
twenty
millions
of
sesterces
equal
to
eight
hundred
thousand
dollars
most
of
the
great
statesmen
of
rome
in
the
time
of
cicero
were
either
lawyers
or
generals
crassus
pompey
sextus
marcellus
clodius
asinius
pollio
cicero
antonius
julius
caesar
caelius
brutus
catullus
were
all
celebrated
for
their
forensic
efforts
candidates
for
the
bar
studied
four
years
under
a
distinguished
jurist
and
were
required
to
pass
a
rigorous
examination
the
judges
were
chosen
from
members
of
the
bar
as
well
as
in
later
times
the
senators
the
great
lawyers
were
not
only
learned
in
the
law
but
possessed
great
accomplishments
varro
was
a
lawyer
and
was
the
most
learned
man
that
rome
ever
produced
but
under
the
emperors
the
lawyers
were
chiefly
distinguished
for
their
legal
attainments
like
paulus
and
ulpian
during
this
golden
age
of
roman
jurisprudence
many
commentaries
were
written
on
the
twelve
tables
the
perpetual
edict
the
laws
of
the
people
and
the
decrees
of
the
senate
as
well
as
a
vast
mass
of
treatises
on
every
department
of
the
law
most
of
which
have
perished
the
institutes
of
gaius
already
mentioned
are
the
most
valuable
that
remain
and
have
thrown
great
light
on
some
important
branches
previously
involved
in
obscurity
their
use
in
explaining
the
institutes
of
justinian
is
spoken
of
very
highly
by
mackenzie
since
the
latter
are
mainly
founded
on
the
work
of
gaius
the
great
lawyers
who
flourished
from
trajan
to
alexander
severus
like
gaius
ulpian
paulus
papinian
and
modestinus
had
no
successors
who
can
be
compared
with
them
and
their
works
became
standard
authorities
in
the
courts
of
law
after
the
death
of
alexander
severus
no
great
accession
was
made
to
roman
law
until
theodosius
caused
the
constitutions
from
constantine
to
his
own
time
to
be
collected
and
arranged
in
sixteen
books
this
was
called
the
theodosian
code
which
in
the
west
was
held
in
high
esteem
it
was
very
influential
among
the
germanic
nations
serving
as
the
chief
basis
of
their
early
legislation
it
also
paved
the
way
for
the
more
complete
codification
that
followed
in
the
justinian
code
which
superseded
it
to
justinian
belongs
the
immortal
glory
of
reforming
the
jurisprudence
of
the
romans
in
the
space
of
ten
centuries
says
gibbon
the
infinite
variety
of
laws
and
legal
opinions
had
filled
many
thousand
volumes
which
no
fortune
could
purchase
and
no
capacity
could
digest
books
could
not
easily
be
found
and
the
judges
poor
in
the
midst
of
riches
were
reduced
to
the
exercise
of
their
illiterate
discretion
the
emperors
had
very
early
begun
to
issue
ordinances
under
the
authority
of
the
various
offices
gathered
into
their
hands
and
these
together
with
the
answers
to
appeals
from
the
lower
courts
made
to
the
emperors
directly
or
to
the
sort
of
supreme
court
which
they
established
were
called
and
justinian
determined
to
unite
in
one
body
all
the
rules
of
law
whatever
may
have
been
their
origin
and
in
the
year
appointed
ten
jurisconsults
among
whom
was
the
celebrated
tribonian
to
select
and
arrange
the
imperial
constitutions
and
rescripts
leaving
out
what
was
obsolete
or
useless
or
contradictory
and
to
make
such
alterations
as
the
circumstances
required
this
was
called
the
divided
into
twelve
books
and
comprising
the
constitutions
from
hadrian
to
justinian
it
was
published
in
fourteen
months
after
it
was
undertaken
justinian
thereupon
authorized
tribonian
then
quaestor
magnificus
magisteria
dignitate
inter
agentes
decoratus
for
great
titles
were
now
given
to
the
officers
of
the
crown
to
prepare
with
the
assistance
of
sixteen
associates
a
collection
of
extracts
from
the
writings
of
the
most
eminent
jurists
so
as
to
form
a
body
of
law
for
the
government
of
the
empire
with
power
to
select
and
omit
and
alter
and
this
immense
work
was
done
in
three
years
and
published
under
the
title
of
digest
or
pandects
says
lord
mackenzie
all
the
judicial
learning
of
former
times
was
laid
under
contribution
by
tribonian
and
his
colleagues
selections
from
the
works
of
of
the
ablest
lawyers
scattered
over
two
thousand
separate
treatises
were
collected
in
one
volume
and
care
was
taken
to
inform
posterity
that
three
millions
of
lines
were
abridged
and
reduced
in
these
extracts
to
the
modest
number
of
one
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
among
the
selected
jurists
only
three
names
belonged
to
the
age
of
the
republic
the
civilians
who
flourished
under
the
first
emperors
are
seldom
appealed
to
so
that
most
of
the
writers
whose
works
have
contributed
to
the
pandects
lived
within
a
period
of
one
hundred
years
more
than
a
third
of
the
whole
pandects
is
from
ulpian
and
next
to
him
the
principal
writers
are
paulus
papinian
salvius
julianus
pomponius
cervidius
scaevola
and
gaius
though
the
variety
of
subjects
is
immense
the
digest
has
no
claims
to
scientific
arrangement
it
is
a
vast
cyclopedia
of
heterogeneous
law
badly
arranged
everything
is
there
but
everything
is
not
in
its
proper
place
neither
the
digest
nor
the
code
was
adapted
to
elementary
instruction
it
was
therefore
necessary
to
prepare
a
treatise
on
the
principles
of
roman
law
this
was
intrusted
to
tribonian
and
two
professors
theophilus
and
dorotheus
it
is
probable
that
tribonian
merely
superintended
the
work
which
was
founded
chiefly
on
the
institutes
of
gaius
divided
into
four
books
it
has
been
universally
admired
for
its
method
and
elegant
precision
it
was
intended
merely
as
an
introduction
to
the
pandects
and
the
code
and
was
entitled
the
institutes
the
or
constitutions
of
were
subsequently
published
being
the
new
ordinances
of
the
emperor
and
the
changes
he
thought
proper
to
make
and
were
therefore
of
high
authority
the
code
pandects
institutes
and
novels
of
justinian
comprise
the
roman
law
as
received
in
europe
in
the
form
given
by
the
school
of
bologna
and
is
called
the
corpus
juris
civilis
savigny
says
it
was
in
that
form
that
the
roman
law
became
the
common
law
of
europe
and
when
four
centuries
later
other
sources
came
to
be
added
to
it
the
of
the
school
of
bologna
had
been
so
universally
received
and
so
long
established
as
a
basis
of
practice
that
the
new
discoveries
remained
in
the
domain
of
science
and
served
only
for
the
theory
of
the
law
for
the
same
reason
the
law
is
excluded
from
practice
after
justinian
the
old
texts
were
left
to
moulder
as
useless
though
venerable
and
they
have
nearly
all
disappeared
the
code
the
pandects
and
the
institutes
were
declared
to
be
the
only
legitimate
authority
and
alone
were
admitted
to
the
tribunals
or
taught
in
the
schools
the
rescripts
of
the
early
emperors
recognized
too
many
popular
rights
to
suit
the
despotic
character
of
justinian
and
the
older
jurists
like
the
scaevolas
sulpicius
and
labeo
were
distasteful
from
their
sympathy
with
free
institutions
different
opinions
have
been
expressed
by
the
jurisconsults
as
to
the
merits
of
the
justinian
collection
by
some
it
is
regarded
as
a
vast
mass
of
legal
lumber
by
others
as
a
beautiful
monument
of
human
labor
after
the
lapse
of
so
many
centuries
it
is
certain
that
a
large
portion
of
it
is
of
no
practical
utility
since
it
is
not
applicable
to
modern
wants
but
again
no
one
doubts
that
it
has
exercised
a
great
and
good
influence
on
moral
and
political
science
and
introduced
many
enlightened
views
concerning
the
administration
of
justice
as
well
as
the
nature
of
civil
government
and
thus
has
modified
the
codes
of
the
teutonic
nations
that
sprang
up
on
the
ruins
of
the
old
roman
world
it
was
used
in
the
greek
empire
until
the
fall
of
constantinople
it
never
entirely
lost
authority
in
italy
although
it
remained
buried
for
centuries
till
the
discovery
of
the
florentine
copy
of
the
pandects
at
the
siege
of
amalfi
in
peter
valence
in
the
eleventh
century
made
use
of
it
in
a
which
he
published
with
the
rise
of
the
italian
cities
the
study
of
roman
law
revived
and
bologna
became
the
seat
from
which
it
spread
over
europe
in
the
sixteenth
century
the
science
of
theoretical
law
passed
from
italy
to
france
under
the
auspices
of
francis
when
cujas
or
cujacius
became
the
great
ornament
of
the
school
of
bourges
and
the
greatest
commentator
on
roman
law
until
dumoulin
appeared
grotius
in
holland
excited
the
same
interest
in
civil
law
that
dumoulin
did
in
france
followed
by
eminent
professors
in
leyden
and
the
german
universities
it
was
reserved
for
pothier
in
the
middle
of
the
eighteenth
century
to
reduce
the
roman
law
to
systematic
order
one
of
the
most
gigantic
tasks
that
ever
taxed
the
industry
of
man
the
recent
discoveries
especially
that
made
by
niebuhr
of
the
work
of
gaius
have
given
a
great
impulse
to
the
study
of
roman
law
in
germany
and
to
this
impulse
no
one
has
contributed
so
greatly
as
savigny
of
berlin
the
great
importance
of
the
subject
demands
a
more
minute
notice
of
the
principles
of
the
roman
law
than
the
limits
of
this
work
properly
allow
i
shall
therefore
endeavor
to
abridge
what
has
been
written
by
eminent
authorities
taking
as
a
basis
the
late
work
of
lord
mackenzie
and
the
learned
and
interesting
essay
of
professor
maine
the
institutes
of
justinian
began
with
the
law
of
persons
recognizing
the
distinction
of
ranks
all
persons
are
capable
of
enjoying
civil
rights
but
not
all
in
the
same
degree
greater
privileges
are
allowed
to
men
than
to
women
to
freemen
than
to
slaves
to
fathers
than
to
children
in
the
eye
of
the
law
all
roman
citizens
were
equal
wherever
they
lived
whether
in
the
capital
or
the
provinces
citizenship
embraced
both
political
and
civil
rights
political
rights
had
reference
to
the
right
of
voting
in
the
comitia
but
this
was
not
considered
the
essence
of
citizenship
which
was
the
enjoyment
of
the
and
by
the
former
the
citizen
could
contract
a
valid
marriage
and
acquire
the
rights
resulting
from
it
particularly
the
paternal
power
by
the
latter
he
could
acquire
and
dispose
of
property
citizenship
was
acquired
by
birth
and
by
manumission
it
was
lost
when
a
roman
became
a
prisoner
of
war
or
had
been
exiled
for
crime
or
became
a
citizen
of
another
state
an
unsullied
reputation
was
required
by
law
for
a
citizen
to
exercise
his
rights
to
their
full
extent
the
roman
jurists
acknowledged
all
persons
originally
free
by
natural
law
and
while
they
recognized
slavery
they
ascribed
the
power
of
masters
entirely
to
the
law
and
custom
of
nations
persons
taken
in
war
were
considered
at
the
absolute
control
of
their
captors
and
were
therefore
slaves
the
children
of
a
female
slave
followed
the
condition
of
their
mother
and
belonged
to
her
master
but
masters
could
manumit
their
slaves
who
thus
became
roman
citizens
with
some
restrictions
after
the
emancipation
of
a
slave
he
was
bound
to
render
certain
services
to
his
former
master
as
patron
and
if
the
freedman
died
intestate
his
property
reverted
to
his
patron
marriage
was
contracted
by
the
simple
consent
of
the
parties
though
in
early
times
equality
of
condition
was
required
the
authorized
connubium
between
patricians
and
plebeians
and
the
allowed
it
between
freedmen
and
freeborn
by
the
in
a
wife
passed
out
of
her
family
into
that
of
her
husband
who
acquired
all
her
property
without
it
the
woman
remained
in
the
power
of
her
father
and
retained
the
free
disposition
of
her
property
polygamy
was
not
permitted
and
relationship
within
certain
degrees
rendered
the
parties
incapable
of
contracting
marriage
these
rules
as
to
forbidden
degrees
have
been
substantially
adopted
in
england
celibacy
was
discouraged
concubinage
was
allowed
if
a
man
had
not
a
wife
and
provided
the
concubine
was
not
the
wife
of
another
man
this
heathenish
custom
was
abrogated
by
justinian
the
wife
was
entitled
to
protection
and
support
from
her
husband
and
she
retained
her
property
independent
of
him
on
her
marriage
the
father
gave
his
daughter
a
dowry
in
proportion
to
his
means
the
management
of
which
with
its
usufruct
during
marriage
belonged
to
the
husband
but
he
could
not
alienate
real
estate
without
the
wife
consent
and
on
the
dissolution
of
marriage
the
reverted
to
the
wife
divorce
existed
in
all
ages
at
rome
and
was
very
common
at
the
beginning
of
the
empire
to
check
its
prevalence
laws
were
passed
inflicting
severe
penalties
on
those
whose
bad
conduct
led
to
it
every
man
whether
married
or
not
could
adopt
children
under
certain
restrictions
and
they
passed
entirely
under
paternal
power
but
the
marriage
relation
among
the
romans
did
not
accord
after
all
with
those
principles
of
justice
which
we
see
in
other
parts
of
their
legislative
code
the
roman
husband
like
the
father
was
a
tyrant
the
facility
of
divorce
destroyed
mutual
confidence
and
inflamed
every
trifling
dispute
for
a
word
or
a
message
or
a
letter
or
the
mandate
of
a
freedman
was
quite
sufficient
to
secure
a
separation
it
was
not
until
christianity
became
the
religion
of
the
empire
that
divorce
could
not
be
easily
effected
without
a
just
cause
this
facility
of
divorce
was
a
great
stigma
on
the
roman
laws
and
the
degradation
of
woman
was
the
principal
consequence
but
woman
never
was
honored
in
any
pagan
land
although
her
condition
at
rome
was
better
than
it
was
at
athens
she
always
was
regarded
as
a
possession
rather
than
as
a
person
her
virtue
was
mistrusted
and
her
aspirations
were
scorned
she
was
hampered
and
guarded
more
like
a
slave
than
the
equal
companion
of
man
but
the
progress
of
legislation
as
a
whole
was
in
her
favor
and
she
continued
to
gain
new
privileges
until
the
fall
of
the
empire
the
roman
catholic
church
regards
marriage
as
one
of
the
sacraments
and
through
all
the
middle
ages
and
down
to
our
own
day
the
great
authority
of
the
church
has
been
one
of
the
strongest
supports
of
that
institution
as
necessary
to
christianity
as
to
civilization
we
americans
have
improved
on
the
morality
of
jesus
of
the
early
and
later
church
and
of
the
great
nations
of
modern
europe
and
in
many
of
our
states
persons
are
allowed
to
slip
out
of
the
marriage
tie
about
as
easily
as
they
get
into
it
nothing
is
more
remarkable
in
the
roman
laws
than
the
extent
of
paternal
power
it
was
unjust
and
bears
the
image
of
a
barbarous
age
moreover
it
seems
to
have
been
coeval
with
the
foundation
of
the
city
a
father
could
chastise
his
children
by
stripes
by
imprisonment
by
exile
by
sending
them
to
the
country
with
chains
on
their
feet
he
was
even
armed
with
the
power
of
life
and
death
neither
age
nor
rank
says
gibbon
nor
the
consular
office
could
exempt
the
most
illustrious
citizen
from
the
bonds
of
filial
subjection
without
fear
though
not
without
danger
of
abuse
the
roman
legislators
had
reposed
unbounded
confidence
in
the
sentiments
of
paternal
love
and
the
oppression
was
tempered
by
the
assurance
that
each
generation
must
succeed
in
its
turn
to
the
awful
dignity
of
parent
and
master
by
an
express
law
of
the
twelve
tables
a
father
could
sell
his
children
as
slaves
but
the
abuse
of
paternal
power
was
checked
in
the
republic
by
the
censors
and
afterward
by
emperors
alexander
severus
limited
the
right
of
the
father
to
simple
correction
and
constantine
declared
the
father
who
should
kill
his
son
to
be
guilty
of
murder
the
rigor
of
parents
in
reference
to
the
disposition
of
the
property
of
children
was
also
gradually
relaxed
under
augustus
the
son
could
keep
absolute
possession
of
what
he
had
acquired
in
war
under
constantine
he
could
retain
any
property
acquired
in
the
civil
service
and
all
property
inherited
from
the
mother
could
also
be
retained
in
later
times
a
father
could
not
give
his
son
or
daughter
to
another
by
adoption
without
their
consent
thus
this
was
gradually
relaxed
as
civilization
advanced
though
it
remained
a
peculiarity
of
roman
law
to
the
latest
times
and
was
severer
than
is
ever
seen
in
the
modern
world
fathers
were
bound
to
maintain
their
children
when
they
had
no
separate
means
to
supply
their
wants
and
children
were
also
bound
to
maintain
their
parents
if
in
want
these
reciprocal
duties
creditable
to
the
roman
lawgivers
are
recognized
in
the
french
code
but
not
in
the
english
which
also
recognizes
the
right
of
a
father
to
bequeath
his
whole
estate
to
strangers
a
thing
which
roman
fathers
had
not
power
to
do
the
age
when
children
attained
majority
among
the
romans
was
years
women
were
condemned
to
the
perpetual
tutelage
of
parents
husbands
or
guardians
as
it
was
supposed
they
never
could
attain
to
the
age
of
reason
and
experience
the
relation
of
guardian
and
ward
was
strictly
observed
by
the
romans
they
made
a
distinction
between
the
right
to
govern
a
person
and
the
right
to
manage
his
estate
although
the
tutor
or
guardian
could
do
both
if
the
pupil
was
an
infant
the
tutor
could
act
without
the
intervention
of
the
pupil
if
the
pupil
was
above
seven
years
of
age
he
was
considered
to
have
an
imperfect
will
the
youth
ceased
to
be
a
pupil
if
a
boy
at
fourteen
if
a
girl
at
twelve
the
tutor
managed
the
estate
of
the
pupil
but
was
liable
for
loss
occasioned
by
bad
management
he
could
sell
movable
property
when
expedient
but
not
real
estate
without
judicial
authority
the
tutor
named
by
the
father
was
preferred
to
all
others
the
institutes
of
justinian
pass
from
persons
to
things
or
the
law
relating
to
real
rights
in
other
words
that
which
pertains
to
property
some
things
common
to
all
like
air
light
the
ocean
and
things
sacred
like
temples
and
churches
are
not
classed
as
property
two
things
were
required
for
the
transfer
of
property
for
it
is
the
essence
of
property
that
the
owner
of
a
thing
should
have
the
right
to
transfer
it
first
the
consent
of
the
owner
to
transfer
the
thing
upon
some
just
ground
and
secondly
the
actual
delivery
of
the
thing
to
the
person
who
is
to
acquire
it
movables
were
presumed
to
be
the
property
of
the
possessors
until
positive
evidence
was
produced
to
the
contrary
a
prescriptive
title
to
movables
was
acquired
by
possession
for
one
year
and
to
immovables
by
possession
for
two
years
undisturbed
possession
for
thirty
years
constituted
in
general
a
valid
title
when
a
roman
died
his
heirs
succeeded
to
all
his
property
by
hereditary
right
if
he
left
no
will
his
estate
devolved
upon
his
relatives
in
a
certain
order
prescribed
by
law
the
power
of
making
a
testament
only
belonged
to
citizens
above
puberty
children
under
the
paternal
power
could
not
make
a
will
males
above
fourteen
and
females
above
twelve
when
not
under
power
could
make
wills
without
the
authority
of
their
guardian
but
pupils
lunatics
prisoners
of
war
criminals
and
various
other
persons
were
incapable
of
making
a
testament
the
testator
could
divide
his
property
among
his
heirs
in
such
proportions
as
he
saw
fit
but
if
there
was
no
distribution
all
the
heirs
participated
equally
a
man
could
disinherit
either
of
his
children
by
declaring
his
intentions
in
his
will
but
only
for
grave
reasons
such
as
grievously
injuring
his
person
or
character
or
feelings
or
attempting
his
life
no
will
was
effectual
unless
one
or
more
persons
were
appointed
heirs
to
represent
the
deceased
wills
were
required
to
be
signed
by
the
testator
or
some
person
for
him
in
the
presence
of
seven
witnesses
who
were
roman
citizens
if
a
will
was
made
by
a
parent
for
distributing
his
property
solely
among
his
children
no
witnesses
were
required
and
the
ordinary
formalities
were
dispensed
with
among
soldiers
in
actual
service
and
during
the
prevalence
of
pestilence
the
testament
was
opened
in
the
presence
of
the
witnesses
or
a
majority
of
them
and
after
they
had
acknowledged
their
seals
a
copy
was
made
and
the
original
was
deposited
in
the
public
archives
according
to
the
twelve
tables
the
powers
of
a
testator
in
disposing
of
his
property
were
unlimited
but
in
process
of
time
laws
were
enacted
to
restrain
immoderate
or
unnatural
bequests
by
the
falcidian
law
in
the
time
of
augustus
no
one
could
leave
in
legacies
more
than
three
fourths
of
his
estate
so
that
the
heirs
could
inherit
at
least
one
fourth
again
a
law
was
passed
by
which
the
descendants
were
entitled
to
one
third
of
the
succession
and
to
one
half
if
there
were
more
than
four
in
france
if
a
man
die
leaving
one
lawful
child
he
can
dispose
of
only
half
his
estate
by
will
if
he
leaves
two
children
he
can
dispose
only
of
one
third
if
he
leaves
three
or
more
children
then
he
can
dispose
by
will
of
only
one
fourth
of
his
estate
in
england
a
man
can
disinherit
both
his
wife
and
children
these
and
many
other
matters
bequests
in
trust
succession
of
men
dying
intestate
heirs
at
law
were
regulated
by
the
romans
in
ways
on
which
our
modern
legislators
have
improved
little
or
none
in
the
matter
of
contracts
the
roman
law
was
especially
comprehensive
and
the
laws
of
france
and
scotland
are
substantially
based
upon
the
roman
system
the
institutes
of
gaius
and
justinian
distinguish
four
sorts
of
obligations
re

gibbon
in
his
learned
chapter
prefers
to
consider
the
specific
obligations
of
men
to
each
other
under
promises
benefits
and
injuries
lord
mackenzie
treats
the
subject
in
the
order
of
the
institutes
obligations
contracted
by
the
intervention
of
are
called
by
the
moderns
real
contracts
because
they
are
not
perfected
till
something
has
passed
from
one
party
to
another
of
this
description
are
the
contracts
of
loan
deposit
and
pledge
security
for

till
the

is
actually
lent
deposited

it
does

form
the
special

next
to
the
perfection
of
contracts
by
the
intervention
of
things
were
obligations
contracted
by
spoken
and
by
or
writings
the
was
contracted
by
uttering
certain
words
of
formal
style
an
interrogation
being
put
by
one
party
and
an
answer
given
by
the
other
these
stipulations
were
binding
in
england
all
guarantees
must
be
in
writing
the
was
a
written
acknowledgment
of
debt
chiefly
employed
when
money
was
borrowed
but
the
creditor
could
not
sue
upon
a
note
within
two
years
from
its
date
without
being
called
upon
also
to
prove
that
the

contracts
perfected
by
consent
had
reference
to
sale
hiring
partnership
and

orders
to

carried
out
by
agents
all
contracts
of
sale
were
good
without
writing
acts
which
caused
damage
to
another
opened
a
new
class
of
cases
the
law
obliged
the
to
make
reparation
and
this
responsibility
extended
to
damages
arising
not
only
from
positive
acts
but
from
negligence
or
imprudence
in
cases
of
libel
or
slander
the
truth
of
the
allegation
might
be
pleaded
in
justification
in
all
cases
it
was
necessary
to
show
that
an
injury
had
been
committed
maliciously
but
if
damage
arose
in
the
exercise
of
a
right
as
killing
a
slave
in
no
claim
for
reparation
could
be
maintained
if
any
one
exercised
a
profession
or
trade
for
which
he
was
not
qualified
he
was
liable
to
all
the
damage
his
want
of
skill
or
knowledge
might
occasion
a
provision
that
some
of
our
modern
laws
might
advantageously
revive
when
any
damage
was
done
by
a
slave
or
an
animal
the
owner
of
the
same
was
liable
for
the
loss
though
the
mischief
was
done
without
his
knowledge
and
against
his
will
if
anything
was
thrown
from
a
window
giving
on
the
public
thoroughfare
so
as
to
injure
any
one
by
the
fall
the
occupier
was
bound
to
repair
the
damage
though
done
by
a
stranger
legal
claims
might
be
transferred
to
a
third
person
by
sale
exchange
or
donation
but
to
prevent
speculators
from
purchasing
debts
at
low
prices
it
was
ordered
that
the
assignee
should
not
be
entitled
to
exact
from
the
debtor
more
than
he
himself
had
paid
to
acquire
the
debt
with
interest
a
wise
and
just
regulation
by
the
ancient
constitution
the
king
had
the
prerogative
of
determining
civil
causes
the
right
then
devolved
on
the
consuls
afterward
on
the
praetor
and
in
certain
cases
on
the
curule
and
plebeian
ediles
who
were
charged
with
the
internal
police
of
the
city
the
praetor
a
magistrate
next
in
dignity
to
the
consuls
acted
as
supreme
judge
of
the
civil
courts
assisted
by
a
council
of
jurisconsults
to
determine
questions
in
law
at
first
one
praetor
was
sufficient
but
as
the
limits
of
the
city
and
empire
extended
he
was
joined
by
a
colleague
after
the
conquest
of
sicily
sardinia
and
the
two
spains
new
praetors
were
appointed
to
administer
justice
in
the
provinces
the
praetor
held
his
court
in
the
comitium
wore
a
robe
bordered
with
purple
sat
in
a
curule
chair
and
was
attended
by
lictors
the
praetor
delegated
his
power
to
three
classes
of
judges
called
respectively
and
when
parties
were
at
issue
about
facts
it
was
the
custom
for
the
praetor
to
fix
the
question
of
law
upon
which
the
action
turned
and
then
to
remit
to
a
delegate
or
judge
to
inquire
into
the
facts
and
pronounce
judgment
according
to
them
in
the
time
of
augustus
there
were
four
thousand
judices
who
were
merely
private
citizens
generally
senators
or
men
of
consideration
the
judex
was
invested
by
the
magistrate
with
a
judicial
commission
for
a
single
case
only
after
being
sworn
to
duty
he
received
from
the
praetor
a
formula
containing
a
summary
of
all
the
points
under
litigation
from
which
he
was
not
allowed
to
depart
he
was
required
not
merely
to
investigate
facts
but
to
give
sentence
and
as
law
questions
were
more
or
less
mixed
up
with
the
case
he
was
allowed
to
consult
one
or
more
jurisconsults
if
the
case
was
beyond
his
power
to
decide
he
could
decline
to
give
judgment
the
arbiter
like
the
judex
received
a
formula
from
the
praetor
and
seemed
to
have
more
extensive
power
the
recuperators
heard
and
determined
cases
but
the
number
appointed
for
each
case
was
usually
three
or
five
the
constituted
a
permanent
tribunal
composed
of
members
annually
elected
in
equal
numbers
from
each
tribe
and
this
tribunal
was
presided
over
by
the
praetor
and
divided
into
four
chambers
which
under
the
republic
was
placed
under
the
ancient
quaestors
the
centumvirs
decided
questions
of
property
embracing
a
wide
range
of
subjects
the
romans
had
no
class
of
men
like
the
judges
of
modern
times
the
superior
magistrates
were
changed
annually
and
political
duties
were
mixed
with
judicial
the
evil
was
partially
remedied
by
the
institution
of
legal
assessors
selected
from
the
most
learned
jurisconsults
under
the
empire
the
praetors
were
greatly
increased
under
tiberius
there
were
sixteen
who
administered
justice
besides
the
consuls
six
ediles
and
ten
tribunes
of
the
people
the
emperor
himself
became
the
supreme
judge
and
he
was
assisted
in
the
discharge
of
his
judicial
duties
by
a
council
composed
of
the
consuls
a
magistrate
of
each
grade
and
fifteen
senators
at
first
the
duties
of
the
praetorian
prefects
were
purely
military
but
finally
they
discharged
important
judicial
functions
the
prefect
of
the
city
in
the
time
of
the
emperors
was
a
great
judicial
personage
who
heard
appeals
from
the
praetors
themselves
in
all
cases
brought
before
the
courts
the
burden
of
proof
was
with
the
party
asserting
an
affirmative
fact
proof
by
writing
was
generally
considered
most
certain
but
proof
by
witnesses
was
also
admitted
pupils
lunatics
infamous
persons
interested
parties
near
relatives
and
slaves
could
not
bear
evidence
nor
any
person
who
had
a
strong
enmity
against
either
party
the
witnesses
were
required
to
give
their
testimony
on
oath
in
most
cases
two
witnesses
were
enough
to
prove
a
fact
when
witnesses
gave
conflicting
testimony
the
judge
regarded
those
who
were
most
worthy
of
credit
rather
than
those
who
were
most
numerous
in
the
english
courts
the
custom
used
to
be
as
with
the
romans
of
refusing
testimony
from
those
who
were
interested
but
this
has
been
removed
on
the
failure
of
regular
proof
the
roman
law
allowed
a
party
to
refer
the
facts
in
a
civil
action
to
the
oath
of
his
adversary
under
the
roman
republic
there
was
no
appeal
in
civil
suits
but
under
the
emperors
a
regular
system
was
established
under
augustus
there
was
an
appeal
from
all
the
magistrates
to
the
prefect
of
the
city
and
from
him
to
the
praetorian
prefect
or
even
to
the
emperor
in
the
provinces
there
was
an
appeal
from
the
municipal
magistrates
to
the
governors
and
from
them
to
the
emperor
as
paul
appealed
from
festus
to
caesar
under
justinian
no
appeal
was
allowed
from
a
suit
which
did
not
involve
at
least
twenty
pounds
in
gold
in
regard
to
criminal
courts
among
the
romans
during
the
republic
the
only
body
which
had
absolute
power
of
life
and
death
was
the
the
senate
had
no
jurisdiction
in
criminal
cases
so
far
as
roman
citizens
were
concerned
it
was
only
in
extraordinary
emergencies
that
the
senate
with
the
consuls
assumed
the
responsibility
of
inflicting
summary
punishment
under
the
emperors
the
senate
was
armed
with
the
power
of
criminal
jurisdiction
and
as
the
senate
was
the
tool
of
the
imperator
he
could
crush
whomsoever
he
pleased
as
it
was
inconvenient
when
rome
had
become
a
very
great
city
to
convene
the
comitia
for
the
trial
of
offenders
the
expedient
was
adopted
of
delegating
the
jurisdiction
of
the
people
to
persons
invested
with
temporary
authority
called
these
were
finally
established
into
regular
and
permanent
courts
called
every
case
submitted
to
these
courts
was
tried
by
a
judge
and
jury
it
was
the
duty
of
the
judge
to
preside
and
regulate
proceedings
according
to
law
and
it
was
the
duty
of
the
jury
after
hearing
the
evidence
and
pleadings
to
decide
on
the
guilt
or
innocence
of
the
accused
as
many
as
fifty
persons
frequently
composed
the
jury
whose
names
were
drawn
out
of
an
urn
each
party
had
a
right
to
challenge
a
certain
number
and
the
verdict
was
decided
by
a
majority
of
votes
at
first
the
judices
were
chosen
from
the
senate
and
afterward
from
the
equestrians
and
then
again
from
both
orders
but
in
process
of
time
the
quaestores
perpetui
gave
place
to
imperial
magistrates
the
accused
defended
himself
in
person
or
by
counsel
the
romans
divided
into
public
and
private
private
crimes
could
be
prosecuted
only
by
the
party
injured
and
were
generally
punished
by
pecuniary
fines
as
among
the
old
germanic
nations
of
public
crimes
the
laesae
or
treason
was
regarded
as
the
greatest
and
this
was
punished
with
death
and
with
confiscation
of
goods
while
the
memory
of
the
offender
was
declared
infamous
greater
severity
could
scarcely
be
visited
on
a
culprit
treason
comprehended
conspiracy
against
the
government
assisting
the
enemies
of
rome
and
misconduct
in
the
command
of
armies
thus
manlius
in
spite
of
his
magnificent
services
was
hurled
from
the
tarpeian
rock
because
he
was
convicted
of
an
intention
to
seize
upon
the
government
under
the
empire
not
only
any
attempt
on
the
life
of
the
emperor
was
treason
but
disrespectful
words
or
acts
the
criminal
was
even
tried
after
death
that
his
memory
might
become
infamous
and
this
barbarous
practice
was
perpetuated
in
france
and
scotland
as
late
as
the
beginning
of
the
seventeenth
century
in
england
men
have
been
executed
for
treasonable
words
besides
treason
there
were
other
crimes
against
the
state
such
as
a
breach
of
the
peace
extortion
on
the
part
of
provincial
governors
embezzlement
of
public
property
stealing
sacred
things
bribery
most
of
which
offences
were
punished
by
pecuniary
penalties
but
there
were
also
crimes
against
individuals
which
were
punished
with
the
death
penalty
wilful
murder
poisoning
and
parricide
were
capitally
punished
adultery
was
punished
by
banishment
besides
a
forfeiture
of
considerable
property
constantine
made
it
a
capital
offence
rape
was
punished
with
death
and
confiscation
of
goods
as
in
england
till
a
late
period
when
transportation
for
life
became
the
penalty
the
punishments
inflicted
for
forgery
coining
base
money
and
perjury
were
arbitrary
robbery
theft
patrimonial
damage
and
injury
to
person
and
property
were
private
trespasses
and
not
punished
by
the
state
after
a
lapse
of
twenty
years
without
accusation
crimes
were
supposed
to
be
extinguished
the
cornelian
pompeian
and
julian
laws
formed
the
foundation
of
criminal
jurisprudence
this
however
never
attained
the
perfection
that
was
seen
in
the
civil
code
in
which
the
full
maturity
of
roman
wisdom
was
reached
the
emperors
greatly
increased
the
severity
of
punishments
as
was
probably
necessary
in
a
corrupt
state
of
society
after
the
decemviral
laws
fell
into
disuse
the
romans
in
the
days
of
the
republic
passed
from
extreme
rigor
to
great
lenity
as
is
observable
in
the
transition
from
the
puritan
régime
to
our
own
times
in
the
united
states
capital
punishment
for
several
centuries
was
exceedingly
rare
and
was
frequently
prevented
by
voluntary
exile
under
the
empire
again
public
executions
were
frequent
and
revolting
fines
were
a
common
mode
of
punishment
with
the
romans
as
with
the
early
germans
imprisonment
in
a
public
jail
was
rare
the
custom
of
bail
being
in
general
use
although
retaliation
was
authorized
by
the
twelve
tables
for
bodily
injuries
it
was
seldom
exacted
since
pecuniary
compensation
was
taken
in
lieu
corporal
punishments
were
inflicted
upon
slaves
but
rarely
upon
citizens
except
for
military
crimes
but
roman
citizens
could
be
sold
into
slavery
for
various
offences
chiefly
military
and
criminals
were
often
condemned
to
labor
in
the
mines
or
upon
public
works
banishment
was
common
et
ignis
and
this
was
equivalent
to
the
deprivation
of
the
necessities
of
life
and
incapacitating
a
person
from
exercising
the
rights
of
citizenship
under
the
emperors
persons
were
confined
often
on
the
rocky
islands
off
the
coast
or
in
a
compulsory
residence
in
a
particular
place
assigned
thus
chrysostom
was
sent
to
a
dreary
place
on
the
banks
of
the
euxine
and
ovid
was
banished
to
tomi
death
when
inflicted
was
by
hanging
scourging
and
beheading
also
by
strangling
in
prison
slaves
were
often
crucified
and
were
compelled
to
carry
their
cross
to
the
place
of
execution
this
was
the
most
ignominious
and
lingering
of
all
deaths
it
was
abolished
by
constantine
from
reverence
to
the
sacred
symbol
under
the
emperors
execution
took
place
also
by
burning
alive
and
exposure
to
wild
beasts
it
was
thus
the
early
christians
were
tormented
since
their
offence
was
associated
with
treason
persons
of
distinction
were
treated
with
more
favor
than
the
lower
classes
and
their
punishments
were
less
cruel
and
ignominious
thus
seneca
condemned
for
privity
to
treason
was
allowed
to
choose
his
mode
of
death
the
criminal
laws
of
modern
european
states
followed
too
often
the
barbarous
custom
of
the
roman
emperors
until
a
recent
date
since
the
french
revolution
the
severity
of
the
penal
codes
has
been
much
modified
the
penal
statutes
of
rome
however
as
gibbon
emphatically
remarks
formed
a
very
small
portion
of
the
code
and
the
pandects
and
in
all
judicial
proceedings
the
life
or
death
of
the
citizen
was
determined
with
less
caution
and
delay
than
the
most
ordinary
question
of
covenant
or
inheritance
this
was
owing
to
the
complicated
relations
of
society
by
which
obligations
are
created
or
annulled
while
duties
to
the
state
are
explicit
and
well
known
being
inscribed
not
only
on
tables
of
brass
but
on
the
conscience
itself
it
was
natural
with
the
growth
and
development
of
commerce
and
dominion
that
questions
should
arise
which
could
not
be
ordinarily
settled
by
ancient
customs
and
the
practice
of
lawyers
and
the
decisions
of
judges
continually
raised
new
difficulties
to
be
met
only
by
new
edicts
it
is
a
pleasing
fact
to
record
that
jurisprudence
became
more
just
and
enlightened
as
it
became
more
intricate
the
principles
of
equity
were
more
regarded
under
the
emperors
than
in
the
time
of
cato
it
is
in
the
application
of
these
principles
that
the
laws
of
the
romans
have
obtained
so
high
consideration
their
abuse
consisted
in
the
expense
of
litigation
and
the
advantages
which
the
rich
thus
obtained
over
the
poor
but
if
delays
and
forms
led
to
an
expensive
and
vexatious
administration
of
justice
these
were
more
than
compensated
by
the
checks
which
a
complicated
jurisprudence
gave
to
hasty
or
partial
decisions
it
was
in
the
minuteness
and
precision
of
the
forms
of
law
and
in
the
foresight
with
which
questions
were
anticipated
in
the
various
transactions
of
business
that
the
romans
in
their
civil
and
social
relations
were
very
much
on
a
level
with
modern
times
it
would
be
difficult
to
find
in
the
most
enlightened
of
modern
codes
greater
wisdom
and
foresight
than
appear
in
the
legacy
of
justinian
as
to
all
questions
pertaining
to
the
nature
the
acquisition
the
possession
the
use
and
the
transfer
of
property
civil
obligations
are
most
admirably
defined
and
all
contracts
are
determined
by
the
wisest
application
of
the
natural
principles
of
justice
nothing
can
be
more
enlightened
than
the
laws
which
relate
to
leases
to
sales
to
partnerships
to
damages
to
pledges
to
hiring
of
work
and
to
the
laws
pertaining
to
the
succession
to
property
to
the
duties
of
guardians
to
the
rights
of
wards
to
legacies
to
bequests
in
trust
and
to
the
general
limitation
of
testamentary
powers
were
singularly
clear
the
regulations
in
reference
to
intestate
succession
and
to
the
division
of
property
among
males
and
females
were
wise
and
just
we
find
no
laws
of
entail
no
unequal
rights
no
absurd
distinction
between
brothers
no
peculiar
privileges
given
to
males
over
females
or
to
older
sons
particularly
was
everything
pertaining
to
property
and
contracts
and
wills
guarded
with
the
most
jealous
care
a
man
was
sure
of
possessing
his
own
and
of
transmitting
it
to
his
children
in
the
institutes
of
justinian
we
see
on
every
page
a
regard
to
the
principles
of
natural
justice
but
moreover
we
find
that
malicious
witnesses
should
be
punished
that
corrupt
judges
should
be
visited
with
severe
penalties
that
libels
and
satires
should
subject
their
authors
to
severe
chastisement
that
every
culprit
should
be
considered
innocent
until
his
guilt
was
proved
no
infringement
on
personal
rights
could
be
tolerated
a
citizen
was
free
to
go
where
he
pleased
to
do
whatsoever
he
would
if
he
did
not
trespass
on
the
rights
of
another
to
seek
his
pleasure
unobstructed
and
pursue
his
business
without
vexatious
incumbrances
if
he
was
injured
or
cheated
he
was
sure
of
redress
nor
could
he
be
easily
defrauded
with
the
sanction
of
the
laws
a
rigorous
police
guarded
his
person
his
house
and
his
property
he
was
supreme
and
uncontrolled
within
his
family
this
security
to
property
and
life
and
personal
rights
was
guaranteed
by
the
greatest
tyrants
although
political
liberty
was
dead
the
fullest
personal
liberty
was
enjoyed
under
the
emperors
and
it
was
under
their
sanction
that
jurisprudence
in
some
of
the
most
important
departments
of
life
reached
perfection
if
injustice
was
suffered
it
was
not
on
account
of
the
laws
but
owing
to
the
depravity
of
men
the
venality
of
the
rich
and
the
tricks
of
lawyers
the
laws
were
wise
and
equal
the
civil
jurisprudence
of
the
romans
could
be
copied
with
safety
by
the
most
enlightened
of
european
states
indeed
it
is
already
the
foundation
of
their
civil
codes
especially
in
france
and
germany
that
there
were
some
features
in
the
roman
laws
which
we
in
these
christian
times
can
not
indorse
and
which
we
reprehend
can
not
be
denied
under
the
republic
there
was
not
sufficient
limit
to
paternal
power
and
the
was
necessarily
a
tyrant
it
was
unjust
that
the
father
should
control
the
property
of
his
son
and
cruel
that
he
was
allowed
an
absolute
control
not
only
over
his
children
but
also
his
wife
yet
the
limits
of
paternal
power
were
more
and
more
curtailed
so
that
under
the
later
emperors
fathers
were
not
allowed
to
have
more
authority
than
was
perhaps
expedient
the
recognition
of
slavery
as
a
domestic
institution
was
another
blot
and
slaves
could
be
treated
with
the
grossest
cruelty
and
injustice
without
possibility
of
redress
but
here
the
romans
were
not
sinners
beyond
all
other
nations
and
our
modern
times
have
witnessed
a
parallel
it
was
not
the
existence
of
slavery
however
which
was
the
greatest
evil
but
the
facility
by
which
slaves
could
be
made
the
laws
pertaining
to
debt
were
severe
and
were
most
disgraceful
in
dooming
a
debtor
to
the
absolute
power
of
a
creditor
to
subject
men
of
the
same
race
to
slavery
for
trifling
debts
which
they
could
not
discharge
was
the
great
defect
of
the
roman
laws
but
even
these
cruel
regulations
were
modified
so
that
in
the
corrupt
times
of
the
empire
there
was
no
greater
practical
severity
than
was
common
in
england
as
late
as
one
hundred
years
ago
the
temptations
to
fraud
were
enormous
in
a
wicked
state
of
society
and
demanded
a
severe
remedy
it
is
possible
that
our
modern
laws
may
show
too
great
leniency
to
debtors
who
are
not
merely
unfortunate
but
dishonest
the
problem
is
not
yet
solved
whether
men
should
be
severely
handled
who
are
guilty
of
reckless
and
unprincipled
speculations
and
unscrupulous
dealings
or
whether
they
should
be
allowed
immunity
to
prosecute
their
dangerous
and
disgraceful
courses
moreover
the
penal
code
of
the
romans
in
reference
to
breaches
of
trust
or
carelessness
or
ignorance
by
which
property
was
lost
or
squandered
may
have
been
too
severe
as
is
still
the
case
in
england
in
reference
to
hunting
game
on
another
grounds
it
was
hard
to
doom
a
man
to
death
who
drove
away
his
neighbor
cattle
or
even
entered
in
the
night
his
neighbor
house
but
severe
penalties
alone
will
keep
men
from
crimes
where
there
is
a
low
state
of
virtue
and
religion
and
general
prosperity
and
contentment
become
impossible
where
there
is
no
efficient
protection
to
property
society
was
never
more
secure
and
happy
in
england
than
when
vagabonds
could
be
arrested
and
when
petty
larcenies
were
visited
with
certain
retribution
every
traveller
in
france
and
england
feels
that
in
regard
to
the
punishment
of
crime
those
older
countries
restricted
as
are
their
political
privileges
are
in
most
questions
of
secure
and
comfortable
living
vastly
superior
to
our
own
the
romans
lost
under
the
emperors
their
political
rights
but
gained
protection
and
safety
in
their
relations
with
society
where
quiet
and
industrious
citizens
feel
safe
in
their
homes
are
protected
from
scoundrels
in
their
dealings
have
ample
scope
for

and
are
free
to
choose
their
private
pleasures
they
resign
themselves
to
the
loss
of
electing
their

without
great
unhappiness
there
are
greater
evils
in
the
world
than
the
deprivation
of
the
elective
franchise
lofty
and
glorious
as
is
this
privilege
the
arbitrary
rule
of
the
emperors
was
fatal
to
political
aspirations
and
rights
and
the
growth
of
a
genuine
manhood
yet
it
is
but
fair
to
note
that
the
evils
of
political
slavery
were
qualified
and
set
off
by
the
excellence
of
the
civil
code
and
the
privileges
of
social
freedom
the
great
practical
evil
connected
with
roman
jurisprudence
was
the
intricacy
and
perplexity
and
uncertainty
of
the
laws
together
with
the
expense
involved
in
litigation
the
class
of
lawyers
was
large
and
their
gains
were
extortionate
justice
was
not
always
to
be
found
on
the
side
of
right
the
law
was
uncertain
as
well
as
costly
the
most
learned
counsel
could
be
employed
only
by
the
rich
and
even
judges
were
venal
so
that
the
poor
did
not
easily
find
adequate
redress
but
all
this
is
the
necessary
attendant
on
a
factitious
state
of
society
and
by
many
is
regarded
as
being
quite
as
characteristic
of
modern
civilized
christian
england
and
america
as
it
was
of
pagan
rome
material
civilization
leads
to
an
undue
estimate
of
money
and
when
money
purchases
all
that
artificial
people
desire
then
all
classes
will
prostitute
themselves
for
its
possession
and
justice
dignity
and
elevation
of
sentiment
will
be
forced
to
retreat
as
hermits
sought
a
solitude
when
society
had
reached
its
lowest
degradation
out
of
pure
despair
of

my
object
in
the
present
lecture
is
not
a
criticism
of
the
principles
of
art
so
much
as
an
enumeration
of
its
various
forms
among
the
ancients
to
show
that
in
this
department
of
civilization
they
reached
remarkable
perfection
and
were
not
inferior
to
modern
christian
nations
the
first
development
of
art
among
all
the
nations
of
antiquity
was
in
architecture
the
earliest
buildings
erected
were
houses
to
protect
people
from
heat
cold
and
the
fury
of
the
elements
of
nature
at
that
remote
period
much
more
attention
was
given
to
convenience
and
practical
utility
than
to
beauty
or
architectural
effect
the
earliest
houses
were
built
of
wood
and
stone
was
not
employed
until
temples
and
palaces
arose
ordinary
houses
were
probably
not
much
better
than
and
hovels
until
wealth
was
accumulated
by
private
persons
the
earliest
monuments
of
enduring
magnificence
were
the
temples
of
powerful
priests
and
the
palaces
of
kings
and
in
egypt
and
assyria
these
appear
earliest
as
well
as
most
other
works
showing
civilization
perhaps
the
first
great
monument
which
arose
after
the
deluge
of
noah
was
the
tower
of
babel
built
probably
of
brick
it
was
intended
to
be
very
lofty
but
of
its
actual
height
we
know
nothing
nor
of
its
style
of
architecture
indeed
we
do
not
know
that
it
was
ever
advanced
beyond
its
foundations
yet
there
are
some
grounds
for
supposing
that
it
was
ultimately
finished
and
became
the
principal
temple
of
the
chaldaean
metropolis
from
the
ruins
of
ancient
monuments
we
conclude
that
architecture
received
its
earliest
development
in
egypt
and
that
its
effects
were
imposing
massive
and
grand
it
was
chiefly
directed
to
the
erection
of
palaces
and
temples
the
ruins
of
which
attest
grandeur
and
vastness
they
were
built
of
stone
in
blocks
so
huge
and
heavy
that
even
modern
engineers
are
at
loss
to
comprehend
how
they
could
have
been
transported
and
erected
all
the
monuments
of
the
pharaohs
are
wonders
especially
such
as
appear
in
the
ruins
of
karnak
a
temple
formerly
designated
as
that
of
jupiter
ammon
it
was
in
the
time
of
sesostris
or
rameses
the
great
the
first
of
the
pharaohs
of
the
nineteenth
dynasty
that
architecture
in
egypt
reached
its
greatest
development
then
we
find
the
blocks
of
stone
in
parallel
courses
the
heavy
pier
the
cylindrical
column
with
its
capital
and
the
bold
and
massive
rectangular
architraves
extending
from
pier
to
pier
and
column
to
column
surmounted
by
a
deep
covered
coping
or
cornice
the
imposing
architecture
of
egypt
was
chiefly
owing
to
the
impressive
vastness
of
the
public
buildings
it
was
not
produced
by
beauty
of
proportion
or
graceful
embellishments
it
was
designed
to
awe
the
people
and
kindle
sentiments
of
wonder
and
astonishment
so
far
as
this
end
was
contemplated
it
was
nobly
reached
even
to
this
day
the
traveller
stands
in
admiring
amazement
before
those
monuments
that
were
old
three
thousand
years
ago
no
structures
have
been
so
enduring
as
the
pyramids
no
ruins
are
more
extensive
and
majestic
than
those
of
thebes
the
temple
of
karnak
and
the
palace
of
rameses
the
great
were
probably
the
most
imposing
ever
built
by
man
this
temple
was
built
of
blocks
of
stone
seventy
feet
in
length
on
a
platform
one
thousand
feet
long
and
three
hundred
wide
with
pillars
sixty
feet
in
height
but
this
and
other
structures
did
not
possess
that
unity
of
design
which
marked
the
grecian
temples
alleys
of
colossal
sphinxes
formed
the
approach
at
karnak
the
alley
was
six
thousand
feet
long
and
before
the
main
body
of
the
edifice
stood
two
obelisks
commemorative
of
the
dedication
the
principal
structures
of
egyptian
temples
do
not
follow
the
straight
line
but
begin
with
pyramidal
towers
which
flank
the
gateways
then
follow
usually
a
court
surrounded
with
colonnades
subordinate
temples
and
houses
for
the
priests
a
second
pylon
or
pyramidal
tower
leads
to
the
interior
and
most
considerable
part
of
the
temple
a
portico
inclosed
with
walls
which
receives
light
only
through
the
entablature
or
openings
in
the
roof
adjoining
this
is
the
cella
of
the
temple
without
columns
enclosed
by
several
walls
often
divided
into
various
small
chambers
with
monolithic
receptacles
for
idols
or
mummies
or
animals
the
columns
stand
within
the
walls
the
colonnade
is
not
as
among
the
greeks
an
expansion
of
the
temple
it
is
merely
the
wall
with
apertures
the
walls
composed
of
square
blocks
are
perpendicular
only
on
the
inside
and
bevelled
externally
so
that
the
thickness
at
the
bottom
sometimes
amounts
to
feet
thus
the
whole
building
assumes
a
pyramidal
form
the
fundamental
principle
of
egyptian
architecture
the
columns
are
more
slender
than
the
early
doric
are
placed
close
together
and
have
bases
of
circular
plinths
the
shaft
diminishes
upward
and
is
ornamented
with
perpendicular
or
oblique
furrows
but
not
fluted
like
grecian
columns
the
capitals
are
of
the
bell
form
ornamented
with
all
kinds
of
foliage
and
have
a
narrow
but
high
abacus
they
abound
with
sculptured
decorations
the
designs
of
which
were
borrowed
from
the
vegetation
of
the
country
the
highest
of
the
columns
of
the
temple
of
luxor
is
five
and
a
quarter
times
the
greatest
diameter
but
no
monuments
have
ever
excited
so
much
curiosity
and
wonder
as
the
pyramids
not
in
consequence
of
any
particular
beauty
or
ingenuity
in
their
construction
but
because
of
their
immense
size
and
unknown
age
none
but
sacerdotal
monarchs
would
ever
have
erected
them
none
but
a
fanatical
people
would
ever
have
toiled
upon
them
we
do
not
know
for
what
purpose
they
were
raised
unless
as
sepulchres
for
kings
they
are
supposed
to
have
been
built
at
a
remote
antiquity
between
two
thousand
and
three
thousand
years
before
christ
lepsius
thought
that
the
oldest
of
these
pyramids
were
built
more
than
three
thousand
years
before
christ
the
pyramid
of
cheops
at
memphis
covers
a
square
whose
side
is
seven
hundred
and
feet
and
rises
into
the
air
nearly
five
hundred
feet
it
is
a
solid
mass
of
stone
which
has
suffered
less
from
time
than
the
mountains
near
it
possibly
it
stands
over
an
immense
substructure
in
which
may
yet
be
found
the
lore
of
ancient
egypt
it
may
even
prove
to
be
the
famous
labyrinth
of
which
herodotus
speaks
built
by
the
twelve
kings
of
egypt
according
to
this
author
one
hundred
thousand
men
worked
on
this
monument
for
forty
years
the
palaces
of
the
kings
are
mere
imitations
of
the
temples
their
only
difference
of
architecture
being
that
their
rooms
are
larger
and
in
greater
numbers
some
think
that
the
famous
labyrinth
was
a
collective
palace
of
many
rulers
of
babylonian
architecture
we
know
little
beyond
what
the
hebrew
scriptures
and
ancient
authors
tell
us
but
though
nothing
survives
of
ancient
magnificence
we
know
that
a
city
whose
walls
according
to
herodotus
were
feet
in
thickness
three
hundred
and
in
height
and
sixty
miles
in
circumference
and
in
which
were
one
hundred
gates
of
brass
must
have
had
considerable
architectural
splendor
this
account
of
babylon
however
is
probably
exaggerated
especially
as
to
the
height
of
the
walls
the
tower
of
belus
the
palace
of
nebuchadnezzar
and
the
obelisk
of
semiramis
were
probably
wonderful
structures
certainly
in
size
which
is
one
of
the
conditions
of
architectural
effect
the
tyrians
must
have
carried
architecture
to
considerable
perfection
since
the
temple
of
solomon
one
of
the
most
magnificent
in
the
ancient
world
was
probably
built
by
artists
from
tyre
it
was
not
remarkable
for
size
it
was
indeed
very
small
but
it
had
great
splendor
of
decoration
it
was
of
quadrangular
outline
erected
upon
a
solid
platform
of
stone
and
bearing
a
striking
resemblance
to
the
oldest
greek
temples
like
those
of
aegina
and
paestum
the
portico
of
the
temple
as
rebuilt
by
herod
was
one
hundred
and
eighty
feet
high
and
the
temple
itself
was
entered
by
nine
gates
thickly
coated
with
silver
and
gold
the
inner
sanctuary
was
covered
on
all
sides
with
plates
of
gold
and
was
dazzling
to
the
eye
the
various
courts
and
porticos
and
palaces
with
which
it
was
surrounded
gave
to
it
a
very
imposing
effect
architectural
art
in
india
was
not
so
impressive
and
grand
as
in
egypt
and
was
directed
chiefly
to
the
erection
of
temples
nor
is
it
of
very
ancient
date
there
is
no
stone
architecture
now
remaining
in
india
according
to
sir
james
fergusson
older
than
two
and
a
half
centuries
before
christ
and
this
is
in
the
form
of
buddhist
temples
generally
traced
to
the
great
asoka
who
reigned
from
to
and
who
established
buddhism
as
a
state
religion
there
were
doubtless
magnificent
buildings
before
his
time
but
they
were
of
wood
and
have
all
perished
we
know
however
nothing
about
them
the
buddhist
temples
were
generally
excavated
out
of
the
solid
rock
and
only
the
façades
were
ornamented
these
were
not
larger
than
ordinary
modern
parochial
churches
and
do
not
give
the
impression
of
extraordinary
magnificence
besides
these
temples
in
india
there
remain
many
examples
of
a
kind
of
memorial
monument
called
or
the
earliest
of
these
are
single
columns
but
the
later
and
more
numerous
are
in
the
shape
of
cones
or
circular
mounds
resembling
domes
rarely
exceeding
one
hundred
feet
in
diameter
around
the
apex
of
each
was
a
balustrade
or
some
ornamental
work
about
six
feet
in
diameter
these
topes
remind
one
of
the
pantheon
at
rome
in
general
form
but
were
of
much
smaller
size
they
were
built
on
a
stone
basement
less
than
fifty
feet
in
height
above
which
was
the
brickwork
in
process
of
time
they
came
to
resemble
pyramidal
towers
rather
than
rounded
domes
and
were
profusely
ornamented
with
carvings
the
great
peculiarity
of
all
indian
architectural
monuments
is
excessive
ornamentation
rather
than
beauty
of
proportion
or
grand
effect
in
course
of
time
however
indian
temples
became
more
and
more
magnificent
and
a
chinese
traveller
in
the
year
describes
one
in
gaudhava
as
four
hundred
and
seventy
feet
high
decorated
with
every
sort
of
precious
substance
its
dome
as
it
appears
in
a
must
have
rivalled
that
of
peter
at
rome
but
no
trace
of
it
now
remains
the
topes
of
india
which
were
numerous
indicate
that
the
hindus
were
acquainted
with
the
arch
both
pointed
and
circular
which
was
not
known
to
the
egyptians
or
the
greeks
the
most
important
of
these
buildings
in
which
are
preserved
valuable
relics
are
found
in
the
punjab
they
were
erected
about
twenty
years
before
christ
in
size
they
are
about
one
hundred
and
feet
in
diameter
connected
with
the
circular
topes
are
found
what
are
called
surrounding
the
topes
built
in
the
form
of
rectangles
with
heavy
pillars
one
of
the
most
interesting
of
these
was
found
to
be
two
hundred
and
feet
long
having
square
pillars
feet
in
height
profusely
carved
with
scenes
from
the
life
of
buddha
topped
by
capitals
in
the
shape
of
elephants
supporting
a
succession
of
horizontal
stone
beams
all
decorated
with
a
richness
of
carving
unknown
in
any
other
country
the
amravati
rail
one
of
the
finest
of
the
ancient
monuments
of
india
is
found
to
be
one
hundred
and
by
one
hundred
and
feet
having
octagonal
pillars
ornamented
with
the
most
elaborate
carvings
from
an
architectural
point
of
view
the
rails
were
surpassed
by
the
or
in
western
india
these
were
cut
in
the
solid
rock
some
one
thousand
different
specimens
are
to
be
found
the
facades
of
these
caves
are
perfect
generally
in
the
form
of
an
arch
executed
in
the
rock
with
every
variety
of
detail
and
therefore
imperishable
without
violence
the
process
of
excavation
extended
through
ten
centuries
from
the
time
of
asoka
and
the
interiors
as
well
as
the
façades
were
highly
ornamented
with
sculptures
the
are
seldom
more
than
one
hundred
and
fifty
feet
deep
and
fifty
feet
in
width
and
the
roofs
are
supported
by
pillars
like
the
interior
of
gothic
cathedrals
some
of
which
are
of
beautiful
proportions
with
elaborated
capitals
though
these
temples
are
no
larger
than
ordinary
christian
churches
they
are
very
impressive
from
the
richly
decorated
carvings
they
were
lighted
from
a
single
opening
in
the
façade
sometimes
in
the
shape
of
a
horseshoe
besides
these
chaityas
or
temples
there
are
still
more
numerous
or
monasteries
found
in
india
of
different
dates
but
none
older
than
the
third
century
before
christ
they
show
a
central
hall
surrounded
on
three
sides
by
cells
for
the
monks
on
the
fourth
side
is
an
open
verandah
facing
this
is
generally
a
shrine
with
an
image
of
buddha
these
edifices
are
not
imposing
unless
surrounded
by
galleries
as
some
were
supported
by
highly
decorated
pillars
the
halls
are
constructed
in
several
stories
with
heavy
masonry
in
the
shape
of
pyramids
adorned
with
the
figures
of
men
and
animals
one
of
these
halls
in
southern
india
had
fifteen
hundred
cells
the
most
celebrated
was
the
nalanda
monastery
founded
in
the
first
century
by
nagarjuna
which
accommodated
ten
thousand
priests
and
was
enclosed
by
a
wall
measuring
sixteen
hundred
feet
by
four
hundred
it
was
to
central
india
what
mount
casino
was
to
italy
and
cluny
was
to
france
in
the
middle
ages
the
seat
of
learning
and
art
it
was
not
until
the
mohammedan
conquest
in
india
that
architecture
received
a
new
impulse
from
the
saracenic
influence
then
arose
the
mosques
minarets
and
palaces
which
are
a
wonder
for
their
magnificence
and
in
which
are
seen
the
influence
of
greek
art
as
well
as
that
of
india
there
is
an
oriental
splendor
in
these
palaces
and
mosques
which
has
called
out
the
admiration
of
critics
although
it
is
different
from
those
types
of
beauty
which
we
are
accustomed
to
praise
but
these
later
edifices
were
erected
in
the
middle
ages
coeval
with
the
cathedrals
of
europe
and
therefore
do
not
properly
come
under
the
head
of
ancient
art
in
which
the
ancient
hindus
whether
of
aryan
or
turanian
descent
did
not
particularly
excel
it
was
in
matters
of
religion
and
philosophy
that
the
hindus
felt
most
interest
even
as
the
ancient
jews
thought
more
of
theology
than
of
art
and
science
architecture
however
as
the
expression
of
genius
and
high
civilization
was
carried
to
perfection
only
by
the
greeks
who
excelled
in
so
many
things
it
was
among
the
ancient
dorians
who
descended
from
the
mountains
of
northern
greece
eighty
years
after
the
fall
of
troy
that
architectural
art
worthy
of
the
name
first
appeared
the
pelasgi
erected
cyclopean
structures
fifteen
hundred
years
before
christ
as
seen
in
the
massive
walls
of
the
acropolis
at
athens
constructed
of
huge
blocks
of
hewn
stone
and
in
the
palaces
of
the
princes
of
the
heroic
times
the
lintel
of
the
doorway
of
the
mycenaean
treasury
is
composed
of
a
single
stone
feet
long
and
sixteen
broad
but
these
edifices
which
aimed
at
splendor
and
richness
merely
were
deficient
in
that
simplicity
and
harmony
which
have
given
immortality
to
the
temples
of
the
dorians
in
this
style
of
architecture
everything
was
suitable
to
its
object
and
was
grand
and
noble
the
great
thickness
of
the
columns
the
beautiful
entablature
the
ample
proportion
of
the
capital
the
great
horizontal
lines
of
the
architrave
and
cornice
predominating
over
the
vertical
lines
of
the
columns
the
severity
of
geometrical
forms
produced
for
the
most
part
by
straight
lines
gave
an
imposing
simplicity
to
the
doric
temple
how
far
the
greek
architects
were
indebted
to
the
egyptian
we
can
not
tell
for
though
columns
are
found
amid
the
ruins
of
the
egyptian
temples
they
are
of
different
shape
from
any
made
by
the
greeks
in
the
structures
of
thebes
we
find
both
the
tumescent
and
the
cylindrical
columns
from
which
amalgamation
might
have
been
produced
the
doric
column
the
greeks
seized
on
beauty
wherever
they
found
it
and
improved
upon
it
the
doric
column
was
not
probably
an
entirely
new
creation
but
shaped
after
models
furnished
by
the
most
original
of
all
the
ancient
nations
even
the
egyptians
the
doric
temples
were
uniform
in
plan
the
columns
were
fluted
and
were
generally
about
six
diameters
in
height
they
diminished
gradually
upward
from
the
base
with
a
slightly
con
vexed
swelling
they
were
surmounted
by
capitals
regularly
proportioned
according
to
their
height
the
entablature
which
the
column
supported
was
also
of
a
certain
number
of
diameters
in
height
so
regular
and
perfect
was
the
plan
of
the
temple
that
if
the
dimensions
of
a
single
column
and
the
proportion
the
entablature
should
bear
to
it
were
given
to
two
individuals
acquainted
with
the
style
with
directions
to
compose
a
temple
they
would
produce
designs
exactly
similar
in
size
arrangement
and
general
proportions
the
doric
order
possessed
a
peculiar
harmony
but
taste
and
skill
were
nevertheless
necessary
in
order
to
determine
the
number
of
diameters
a
column
should
have
and
also
the
height
of
the
entablature
the
doric
was
the
favorite
order
of
european
greece
for
one
thousand
years
and
also
of
her
colonies
in
sicily
and
magna
graecia
it
was
used
exclusively
until
after
the
macedonian
conquest
and
was
chiefly
applied
to
temples
the
massive
temples
of
paestum
the
colossal
magnificence
of
the
sicilian
ruins
and
the
more
elegant
proportions
of
the
athenian
structures
like
the
parthenon
and
temple
of
theseus
show
the
perfection
of
the
doric
architecture
although
the
general
style
of
all
the
doric
temples
is
so
uniform
hardly
two
temples
were
alike
the
earlier
doric
was
more
massive
the
later
was
more
elegant
and
its
edifices
were
rich
in
sculptured
decorations
nothing
could
surpass
the
beauty
of
a
doric
temple
in
the
time
of
pericles
the
stylobate
or
general
base
upon
which
the
columnar
story
stood
from
two
thirds
to
a
whole
diameter
of
a
column
in
height
was
built
in
three
equal
courses
which
gradually
receded
upward
and
formed
steps
as
it
were
of
a
grand
platform
the
column
simply
set
upon
the
stylobate
without
base
or
pedestal
was
from
four
to
six
diameters
in
height
with
twenty
flutes
having
a
capital
of
half
a
diameter
on
this
rested
the
entablature
two
in
height
which
was
divided
into
architrave
lower
mouldings
frieze
broad
middle
space
and
cornice
upper
mouldings
the
great
beauty
of
the
temple
was
the
portico
in
front
a
forest
of
columns
supporting
the
triangular
pediment
about
a
diameter
and
a
half
to
the
apex
making
an
angle
at
the
base
of
about
fourteen
degrees
from
the
pediment
projects
the
cornice
while
in
the
apex
and
at
the
base
of
the
flat
gable
are
sculptured
ornaments
generally
the
figures
of
men
or
animals
the
whole
outline
of
columns
supporting
the
entablature
is
graceful
while
the
variety
of
light
and
shade
arising
from
the
arrangement
of
mouldings
and
capitals
produces
a
grand
effect
the
parthenon
the
most
beautiful
specimen
of
the
doric
has
never
been
equalled
and
it
still
stands
august
in
its
ruins
the
glory
of
the
old
acropolis
and
the
pride
of
athens
it
was
built
of
white
pentelic
marble
and
rested
on
a
basement
of
limestone
it
was
two
hundred
and
feet
in
length
one
hundred
and
one
in
breadth
and
in
height
surrounded
with
fluted
columns
six
feet
and
two
inches
at
the
base
and
feet
in
height
while
within
the
peristyle
at
either
end
was
an
interior
range
of
columns
standing
before
the
end
of
the
cella
the
frieze
and
the
pediment
were
elaborately
ornamented
with
reliefs
and
statues
and
the
cella
within
and
without
was
adorned
with
the
choicest
sculptures
of
phidias
the
remains
of
the
exquisite
sculptures
of
the
pediment
and
the
frieze
were
in
the
early
part
of
this
century
brought
from
greece
by
lord
elgin
purchased
by
the
english
government
and
placed
in
the
british
museum
where
preserved
from
further
dilapidation
they
stand
as
indisputable
evidence
of
the
perfection
of
greek
art
the
grandest
adornment
of
the
temple
was
the
colossal
statue
of
minerva
in
the
eastern
apartment
of
the
cella
forty
feet
in
height
composed
of
gold
and
ivory
the
inner
walls
of
the
chamber
were
decorated
with
paintings
and
the
whole
temple
was
a
repository
of
countless
treasure
but
the
parthenon
so
regular
to
the
eye
with
its
vertical
oblique
and
horizontal
lines
was
curved
in
every
line
with
the
exception
of
the
gable
with
its
entablature
architrave
frieze
and
cornice
together
with
the
basement
all
arched
upwards
and
even
the
columns
had
a
slight
convexity
of
vertical
line
amounting
to
of
the
entire
height
of
shaft
though
so
slightly
as
not
to
be
perceptible
these
curved
lines
gave
to
the
structure
a
peculiar
grace
which
can
not
be
imitated
as
well
as
an
effect
of
solidity
nearly
coeval
with
the
doric
was
the
ionic
order
invented
by
the
asiatic
greeks
still
more
graceful
though
not
so
imposing
the
acropolis
is
a
perfect
example
of
this
order
the
column
is
nine
diameters
in
height
with
a
base
while
the
capital
is
more
ornamented
than
the
doric
the
shaft
is
fluted
with
flutes
and
alternate
fillets
flat
longitudinal
ridges
and
the
fillet
is
about
a
quarter
the
width
of
the
flute
the
pediment
is
flatter
than
that
of
the
doric
order
and
more
elaborate
the
great
distinction
of
the
ionic
column
is
a
base
and
a
capital
formed
with
volutes
spiral
scrolls
the
shaft
also
being
more
slender
vitruvius
the
greatest
authority
among
the
ancients
in
architecture
says
that
the
greeks
in
inventing
these
two
kinds
of
columns
imitated
in
the
one
the
naked
simplicity
and
dignity
of
man
and
in
the
other
the
delicacy
and
ornaments
of
woman
the
base
of
the
ionic
was
the
imitation
of
sandals
and
the
volutes
of
ringlets
the
discoveries
of
many
of
the
ionic
ornamentations
among
the
remains
of
assyrian
architecture
indicate
the
oriental
source
of
the
ionic
ideas
just
as
the
doric
style
seems
to
have
originated
in
egypt
the
artistic
greeks
however
always
simplified
and
refined
upon
their
masters
the
corinthian
order
exhibits
a
still
greater
refinement
and
elegance
than
the
other
two
and
was
introduced
toward
the
end
of
the
peloponnesian
war
its
peculiarity
consists
in
columns
with
foliated
capitals
modelled
after
the
acanthus
leaf
and
still
greater
height
about
ten
diameters
surmounted
with
a
more
ornamented
entablature
of
this
order
the
most
famous
temple
in
greece
was
that
of
minerva
at
tegea
built
by
scopas
of
paros
but
destroyed
by
fire
four
hundred
years
before
christ
nothing
more
distinguished
greek
architecture
than
the
variety
the
grace
and
the
beauty
of
the
mouldings
generally
in
eccentric
curves
the
general
outline
of
the
moulding
is
a
gracefully
flowing
cyma
or
wave
concave
at
one
end
and
convex
at
the
other
like
an
italic
the
concavity
and
convexity
being
exactly
in
the
same
curve
according
to
the
line
of
beauty
which
hogarth
describes
the
most
beautiful
application
of
greek
architecture
was
in
the
temples
which
were
very
numerous
and
of
extraordinary
grandeur
long
before
the
persian
war
their
entrance
was
always
from
the
west
or
the
east
they
were
built
either
in
an
oblong
or
round
form
and
were
mostly
adorned
with
columns
those
of
an
oblong
form
had
columns
either
in
the
front
alone
or
in
the
eastern
and
western
fronts
or
on
all
the
four
sides
they
generally
had
porticos
attached
to
them
and
were
without
windows
receiving
their
light
from
the
door
or
from
above
the
friezes
were
adorned
with
various
sculptures
as
were
sometimes
the
pediments
and
no
expense
was
spared
upon
them
the
most
important
part
of
the
temple
was
the
cell
or
temple
proper
a
square
chamber
in
which
the
statue
of
the
deity
was
kept
generally
surrounded
with
a
balustrade
in
front
of
the
cella
was
the
vestibule
and
in
the
rear
or
back
a
chamber
in
which
the
treasures
of
the
temple
were
kept
names
were
applied
to
the
temples
as
well
as
to
the
porticos
according
to
the
number
of
columns
in
the
portico
at
either
end
of
the
temple
such
as
the
tetrastyle
four
columns
in
front
or
hexastyle
when
there
were
six
there
were
never
more
than
ten
columns
across
the
front
the
parthenon
had
eight
but
six
was
the
usual
number
it
was
the
rule
to
have
twice
as
many
columns
along
the
sides
as
in
front
some
of
the
temples
had
double
rows
of
columns
on
all
sides
like
that
of
diana
at
ephesus
and
of
quirinus
at
rome
the
distance
between
the
columns
varied
from
one
diameter
and
a
half
to
four
diameters
about
five
eighths
of
a
doric
temple
were
occupied
by
the
cella
and
three
eighths
by
the
portico
that
which
gives
to
the
greek
temples
so
much
simplicity
and
harmony
the
great
elements
of
beauty
in
architecture
is
the
simple
outline
in
parallelogrammic
and
pyramidal
forms
in
which
the
lines
are
uninterrupted
through
their
entire
length
this
simplicity
and
harmony
are
more
apparent
in
the
doric
than
in
any
of
the
other
orders
but
pertain
to
all
the
grecian
temples
of
which
we
have
knowledge
the
ionic
and
corinthian
or
the
voluted
and
foliated
orders
do
not
possess
that
severe
harmony
which
pervades
the
doric
but
the
more
beautiful
compositions
are
so
consummate
that
they
will
ever
be
taken
as
models
of
study
there
is
now
no
doubt
that
the
exteriors
of
the
grecian
temples
were
ornamented
in
color
perhaps
with
historical
pictures
although
as
the
traces
have
mostly
disappeared
it
is
impossible
to
know
the
extent
or
mode
of
decoration
it
has
been
thought
that
the
mouldings
also
may
have
been
gilded
or
colored
and
that
the
background
of
the
sculptures
had
some
flat
color
laid
on
as
a
relief
to
the
raised
figures
we
may
be
sure
however
it
was
done
that
the
effect
was
not
gaudy
or
crude
but
restrained
within
the
limits
of
refinement
and
good
taste
by
the
infallible
artistic
instinct
of
those
masters
of
the
beautiful
it
is
not
the
magnitude
of
the
greek
temples
and
other
works
of
art
which
most
impresses
us
it
is
not
for
this
that
they
are
important
models
it
is
not
for
this
that
they
are
copied
and
reproduced
in
all
the
modern
nations
of
europe
they
were
generally
small
compared
with
the
temples
of
egypt
and
with
the
vast
dimensions
of
roman
amphitheatres
only
three
or
four
would
compare
in
size
with
a
gothic
cathedral
the
parthenon
the
temple
of
olympian
zeus
at
athens
and
the
temple
of
diana
at
ephesus
even
the
pantheon
at
rome
is
small
compared
with
the
later
monuments
of
the
caesars
the
traveller
is
always
disappointed
in
contemplating
the
ruins
of
greek
buildings
so
far
as
size
is
concerned
but
it
is
their
matchless
proportions
their
severe
symmetry
the
grandeur
of
effect
the
undying
beauty
the
graceful
form
which
impress
us
and
make
us
feel
that
they
are
perfect
by
the
side
of
the
colosseum
they
are
insignificant
in
magnitude
they
do
not
cover
acres
like
the
baths
of
caracalla
yet
who
has
copied
the
flavian
amphitheatre
who
erects
an
edifice
after
the
style
of
the
thermae
all
artists
however
copy
the
parthenon
that
and
not
the
colossal
monuments
of
the
caesars
reappears
in
the
capitals
of
europe
and
stimulates
the
genius
of
a
michael
angelo
or
a
christopher
wren
the
flourishing
period
of
greek
architecture
was
during
the
period
from
pericles
to
alexander
one
hundred
and
thirteen
years
the
macedonian
conquest
introduced
more
magnificence
and
less
simplicity
the
roman
conquest
accelerated
the
decline
in
severe
taste
when
different
orders
began
to
be
used
indiscriminately
in
this
state
the
art
passed
into
the
hands
of
the
masters
of
the
world
and
they
inaugurated
a
new
era
in
architecture
the
art
was
still
essentially
greek
although
the
romans
derived
their
first
knowledge
from
the
etruscans
the
cloaca
maxima
or
great
sewer
was
built
during
the
reign
of
the
second
tarquin
the
grandest
monument
of
the
reign
of
the
kings
it
is
not
probable
that
temples
and
other
public
buildings
in
rome
were
either
beautiful
or
magnificent
until
the
conquest
of
greece
after
which
grecian
architects
were
employed
the
romans
adopted
the
corinthian
style
which
they
made
even
more
ornamental
and
by
the
successful
combination
of
the
etruscan
arch
with
the
grecian
column
they
laid
the
foundation
of
a
new
and
original
style
susceptible
of
great
variety
and
magnificence
they
entered
into
architecture
with
the
enthusiasm
of
their
teachers
but
in
their
passion
for
novelty
lost
sight
of
the
simplicity
which
is
the
great
fascination
of
a
doric
temple
says
memes
they
the
romans
deemed
that
lightness
and
grace
were
to
be
attained
not
so
much
by
proportion
between
the
vertical
and
the
horizontal
as
by
the
comparative
slenderness
of
the
former
hence
we
see
a
poverty
in
roman
architecture
in
the
midst
of
profuse
ornament
the
great
error
was
a
constant
aim
to
lessen
the
diameter
while
they
increased
the
elevation
of
the
columns
hence
the
massive
simplicity
and
severe
grandeur
of
the
ancient
doric
disappear
in
the
roman
the
characteristics
of
the
order
being
frittered
down
into
a
multiplicity
of
minute
details
when
the
romans
used
the
doric
at
all
they
used
a
base
for
the
column
which
was
never
done
at
athens
they
also
altered
the
doric
capital
which
can
not
be
improved
again
most
of
the
grecian
doric
temples
were
peripteral
surrounded
with
pillars
on
all
the
sides
but
the
romans
built
with
porticos
on
one
front
only
which
had
a
greater
projection
than
the
grecian
they
generally
were
projected
three
columns
while
the
greek
portico
had
usually
but
a
single
row
many
of
the
roman
temples
are
circular
like
the
pantheon
which
has
a
portico
of
eight
columns
projected
to
the
depth
of
three
nor
did
the
romans
construct
hypaethral
or
uncovered
temples
with
internal
columns
like
the
greeks
the
pantheon
is
an
exception
since
the
dome
has
an
open
eye
and
one
great
ornament
of
this
beautiful
structure
is
in
the
arrangement
of
internal
columns
placed
in
the
front
of
niches
composed
of
antae
or
ends
of
walls
to
carry
an
entablature
round
under
an
attic
on
which
the
cupola
rests
the
romans
also
adopted
coupled
columns
broken
and
recessed
entablatures
and
pedestals
which
are
considered
blemishes
they
again
paid
more
attention
to
the
interior
than
to
the
exterior
decoration
of
their
palaces
and
baths
as
we
may
infer
from
the
ruins
of
hadrian
villa
at
tivoli
and
the
excavations
of
pompeii
the
pediments
used
in
roman
architectural
works
are
steeper
than
those
made
by
the
greeks
varying
in
inclination
from
eighteen
to
degrees
instead
of
fourteen
the
mouldings
are
the
same
as
the
grecian
in
general
form
although
they
differ
from
them
in
contour
they
are
less
delicate
and
graceful
but
were
used
in
great
profusion
roman
architecture
is
overdone
with
ornament
every
moulding
carved
and
every
straight
surface
sculptured
with
foliage
or
historical
subjects
in
relief
the
ornaments
of
the
frieze
consist
of
foliage
and
animals
with
a
variety
of
other
things
the
great
exuberance
of
ornament
is
considered
a
defect
although
when
applied
to
some
structures
it
is
exceedingly
beautiful
in
the
time
of
the
first
caesars
roman
architecture
had
from
the
huge
size
of
the
buildings
a
character
of
grandeur
and
magnificence
columns
and
arches
appeared
in
all
the
leading
public
buildings
columns
generally
forming
the
external
and
arches
the
internal
construction
fabric
after
fabric
arose
on
the
ruins
of
others
the
flavii
supplanted
the
edifices
of
nero
which
ministered
to
debauchery
by
structures
of
public
utility
the
romans
invented
no
new
principle
in
architecture
unless
it
be
the
arch
which
was
known
though
not
practically
applied
by
the
assyrians
egyptians
and
greeks
the
romans
were
a
practical
and
utilitarian
people
and
needed
for
their
various
structures
greater
economy
of
material
than
was
compatible
with
large
blocks
of
stone
especially
for
such
as
were
carried
to
great
altitudes
the
arch
supplied
this
want
and
is
perhaps
the
greatest
invention
ever
made
in
architecture
no
instance
of
its
adoption
occurs
in
the
construction
of
greek
edifices
before
greece
became
a
part
of
the
roman
empire
its
application
dates
back
to
the
cloaca
maxima
and
may
have
been
of
etrurian
invention
some
maintain
that
archimedes
of
sicily
was
the
inventor
of
the
arch
but
to
whomsoever
the
glory
of
the
invention
is
due
it
is
certain
that
the
romans
were
the
first
of
european
nations
to
make
a
practical
application
of
its
wonderful
qualities
it
enabled
them
to
rear
vast
edifices
with
the
humblest
materials
to
build
bridges
aqueducts
sewers
amphitheatres
and
triumphal
arches
as
well
as
temples
and
palaces
the
merits
of
the
arch
have
never
been
lost
sight
of
by
succeeding
generations
and
it
is
an
essential
element
in
the
magnificent
gothic
cathedrals
of
the
middle
ages
its
application
extends
to
domes
and
cupolas
to
floors
and
corridors
and
roofs
and
to
various
other
parts
of
buildings
where
economy
of
material
and
labor
is
desired
it
was
applied
extensively
to
doorways
and
windows
and
is
an
ornament
as
well
as
a
utility
the
most
imposing
forms
of
roman
architecture
may
be
traced
to
a
knowledge
of
the
properties
of
the
arch
and
as
brick
was
more
extensively
used
than
any
other
material
the
arch
was
invaluable
the
imperial
palace
on
mount
palatine
the
pantheon
except
its
portico
and
internal
columns
the
temples
of
peace
of
venus
and
rome
and
of
minerva
medica
were
of
brick
so
were
the
great
baths
of
titus
caracalla
and
diocletian
the
villa
of
hadrian
the
city
walls
the
villa
of
mecaenas
at
tivoli
and
most
of
the
palaces
of
the
nobility
although
like
many
of
the
temples
they
were
faced
with
stone
the
colosseum
was
of
travertine
a
cheap
white
limestone
and
faced
with
marble
it
was
another
custom
to
stucco
the
surface
of
brick
walls
as
favorable
to
decorations
in
consequence
of
the
invention
of
the
arch
the
romans
erected
a
greater
variety
of
fine
structures
than
either
the
greeks
or
egyptians
whose
public
edifices
were
chiefly
confined
to
temples
the
arch
entered
into
almost
every
structure
public
or
private
and
superseded
the
use
of
long
which
were
necessary
in
the
grecian
temples
as
also
of
wooden
timbers
in
the
use
of
which
the
romans
were
not
skilled
and
which
do
not
really
pertain
to
architecture
an
imposing
edifice
must
always
be
constructed
of
stone
or
brick
the
arch
also
enabled
the
romans
to
economize
in
the
use
of
costly
marbles
of
which
they
were
very
fond
as
well
as
of
other
stones
some
of
the
finest
columns
were
made
of
egyptian
granite
very
highly
polished
the
extensive
application
of
the
arch
doubtless
led
to
the
deterioration
of
the
grecian
architecture
since
it
blended
columns
with
arcades
and
thus
impaired
the
harmony
which
so
peculiarly
marked
the
temples
of
athens
and
corinth
and
as
taste
became
vitiated
with
the
decline
of
the
empire
monstrous
combinations
took
place
which
were
a
great
fall
from
the
simplicity
of
the
parthenon
and
the
interior
of
the
pantheon
but
whatever
defects
marked
the
age
of
diocletian
and
constantine
it
can
never
be
questioned
that
the
romans
carried
architecture
to
a
perfection
rarely
attained
in
our
times
they
may
not
have
equalled
the
severe
simplicity
of
their
teachers
the
greeks
but
they
surpassed
them
in
the
richness
of
their
decorations
and
in
all
buildings
designed
for
utility
especially
in
private
houses
and
baths
and
theatres
the
romans
do
not
seem
to
have
used
other
than
semicircular
arches
the
gothic
or
pointed
or
christian
architecture
as
it
has
been
variously
called
was
the
creation
of
the
middle
ages
and
arose
almost
simultaneously
in
europe
after
the
first
crusade
so
that
it
would
seem
to
be
of
eastern
origin
but
it
was
a
graft
on
the
old
roman
arch
in
the
curve
of
the
ellipse
rather
than
the
circle
aside
from
this
invention
of
the
arch
to
which
we
are
indebted
for
the
most
beautiful
ecclesiastical
structures
ever
erected
we
owe
everything
in
architecture
to
the
greeks
and
romans
we
have
found
out
no
new
principles
which
were
not
known
to
vitruvius
no
one
man
was
the
inventor
or
creator
of
the
wonderful
structures
which
ornamented
the
cities
of
the
ancient
world
we
have
the
names
of
great
architects
who
reared
various
and
faultless
models
but
they
all
worked
upon
the
same
principles
and
these
can
never
be
subverted
so
that
in
architecture
the
ancients
are
our
schoolmasters
whose
genius
we
revere
the
more
we
are
acquainted
with
their
works
what
more
beautiful
than
one
of
those
grand
temples
which
the
cultivated
heathen
greeks
erected
to
the
worship
of
their
unknown
gods
the
graduated
and
receding
stylobate
as
a
base
for
the
fluted
columns
rising
at
regular
distances
in
all
their
severe
proportion
and
matchless
harmony
with
their
richly
carved
capitals
supporting
an
entablature
of
heavy
stones
most
elaborately
moulded
and
ornamented
with
the
figures
of
plants
and
animals
and
rising
above
this
on
the
ends
of
the
temple
or
over
a
portico
several
columns
deep
the
pediment
covered
with
chiselled
cornices
with
still
richer
ornaments
rising
from
the
apices
and
at
the
feet
all
carved
in
white
marble
and
then
spread
over
an
area
larger
than
any
modern
churches
making
a
forest
of
columns
to
bear
aloft
those
ponderous
beams
of
stone
without
anything
tending
to
break
the
continuity
of
horizontal
lines
by
which
the
harmony
and
simplicity
of
the
whole
are
regulated
so
accurately
squared
and
nicely
adjusted
were
the
stones
and
pillars
of
which
these
temples
were
composed
that
there
was
scarcely
need
even
of
cement
without
noise
or
confusion
or
sound
of
hammers
did
those
temples
rise
since
all
their
parts
were
cut
and
carved
in
the
distant
quarries
and
with
mathematical
precision
and
within
the
cella
nearly
concealed
by
surrounding
columns
were
the
statues
of
the
gods
and
the
altars
on
which
incense
was
offered
or
sacrifices
made
in
every
part
interior
and
exterior
do
we
see
a
matchless
proportion
and
beauty
whether
in
the
shaft
or
the
capital
or
the
frieze
or
the
pilaster
or
the
pediment
or
the
cornices
or
even
the
mouldings
everywhere
grace
and
harmony
which
grow
upon
the
mind
the
more
they
are
contemplated
the
greatest
evidence
of
the
matchless
creative
genius
displayed
in
those
architectural
wonders
is
that
after
two
thousand
years
and
with
all
the
inventions
of
roman
and
modern
artists
no
improvement
has
been
made
and
those
edifices
which
are
the
admiration
of
our
own
times
are
deemed
beautiful
as
they
approximate
the
ancient
models
which
will
forever
remain
objects
of
imitation
no
science
can
make
two
and
two
other
than
four
no
art
can
make
a
doric
temple
different
from
the
parthenon
without
departing
from
the
settled
principles
of
beauty
and
proportion
which
all
ages
have
indorsed
such
were
the
greeks
and
romans
in
an
art
which
is
one
of
the
greatest
indices
of
material
civilization
and
which
by
them
was
derived
from
geometrical
forms
or
the
imitation
of
nature
the
genius
displayed
by
the
ancients
in
sculpture
is
even
more
remarkable
than
their
skill
in
architecture
sculpture
was
carried
to
perfection
only
by
the
greeks
but
they
did
not
originate
the
art
since
we
read
of
sculptured
images
from
the
remotest
antiquity
the
earliest
names
of
sculptors
are
furnished
by
the
old
testament
assyria
and
egypt
are
full
of
relics
to
show
how
early
this
art
was
cultivated
it
was
not
carried
to
perfection
as
early
probably
as
architecture
but
rude
images
of
gods
carved
in
wood
are
as
old
as
the
history
of
idolatry
the
history
of
sculpture
is
in
fact
identified
with
that
of
idols
the
egyptians
were
probably
the
first
who
made
any
considerable
advances
in
the
execution
of
statues
those
which
remain
are
rude
simple
uniform
without
beauty
or
grace
except
a
certain
serenity
of
facial
expression
which
seems
to
pervade
all
their
portraiture
but
colossal
and
grand
nearly
two
thousand
years
before
christ
the
walls
of
thebes
were
ornamented
with
sculptured
figures
even
as
the
gates
of
babylon
were
made
of
sculptured
bronze
the
dimensions
of
egyptian
colossal
figures
surpass
those
of
any
other
nation
the
sitting
statues
of
memnon
at
thebes
are
fifty
feet
in
height
and
the
sphinx
is
all
of
granite
the
number
of
colossal
statues
was
almost
incredible
the
sculptures
found
among
the
ruins
of
karnak
must
have
been
made
nearly
four
thousand
years
ago
they
exhibit
great
simplicity
of
design
but
have
not
much
variety
of
expression
they
are
generally
carved
from
the
hardest
stones
and
finished
so
nicely
that
we
infer
that
the
egyptians
were
acquainted
with
the
art
of
hardening
metals
for
their
tools
to
a
degree
not
known
in
our
times
but
we
see
no
ideal
grandeur
among
any
of
the
remains
of
egyptian
sculpture
however
symmetrical
or
colossal
there
is
no
diversity
of
expression
no
trace
of
emotion
no
intellectual
force
everything
is
calm
impassive
imperturbable
it
was
not
until
sculpture
came
into
the
hands
of
the
greeks
that
any
remarkable
excellence
in
grace
of
form
or
expression
of
face
was
reached
but
the
progress
of
development
was
slow
the
earliest
carvings
were
rude
wooden
images
of
the
gods
and
more
than
a
thousand
years
elapsed
before
the
great
masters
were
produced
whose
works
marked
the
age
of
pericles
it
is
not
my
object
to
give
a
history
of
the
development
of
the
plastic
art
but
to
show
the
great
excellence
it
attained
in
the
hands
of
immortal
sculptors
the
greeks
had
an
intuitive
perception
of
the
beautiful
and
to
this
great
national
trait
we
ascribe
the
wonderful
progress
which
sculpture
made
nature
was
most
carefully
studied
by
the
greek
artists
and
that
which
was
most
beautiful
in
nature
became
the
object
of
their
imitation
they
even
attained
to
an
ideal
excellence
since
they
combined
in
a
single
statue
what
could
not
be
found
in
a
single
individual
as
zeuxis
is
said
to
have
studied
the
beautiful
forms
of
seven
virgins
of
crotona
in
order
to
paint
his
famous
picture
of
venus
great
as
was
the
beauty
of
phryne
or
aspasia
or
lais
yet
no
one
of
them
could
have
served
for
a
perfect
model
and
it
required
a
great
sensibility
to
beauty
in
order
to
select
and
idealize
what
was
most
perfect
in
the
human
figure
beauty
was
adored
in
greece
and
every
means
were
used
to
perfect
it
especially
beauty
of
form
which
is
the
characteristic
excellence
of
grecian
statuary
the
gymnasia
were
universally
frequented
and
the
great
prizes
of
the
games
bestowed
for
feats
of
strength
and
agility
were
regarded
as
the
highest
honors
which
men
could
receive
the
subject
of
the
poet
ode
and
the
people
admiration
statues
of
the
victors
perpetuated
their
fame
and
improved
the
sculptor
art
from
the
study
of
these
statues
were
produced
those
great
creations
which
all
subsequent
ages
have
admired
and
from
the
application
of
the
principles
seen
in
these
forms
we
owe
the
perpetuation
of
the
ideas
of
grace
and
beauty
such
as
no
other
people
besides
the
greeks
had
ever
discovered
or
indeed
scarcely
appreciated
the
sculpture
of
the
human
figure
became
a
noble
object
of
ambition
in
greece
and
was
most
munificently
rewarded
great
artists
arose
whose
works
adorned
the
temples
of
greece
so
long
as
she
preserved
her
independence
and
when
that
was
lost
her
priceless
productions
were
scattered
over
asia
and
europe
the
romans
especially
seized
what
was
most
prized
whether
or
not
they
could
tell
what
was
most
perfect
greece
lived
in
her
marble
statues
more
than
in
her
government
or
laws
and
when
we
remember
the
estimation
in
which
sculpture
was
held
among
the
greeks
the
great
prices
paid
for
masterpieces
the
care
and
attention
with
which
they
were
guarded
and
preserved
and
the
innumerable
works
which
were
produced
filling
all
the
public
buildings
especially
consecrated
places
and
even
open
spaces
and
the
houses
of
the
rich
and
great
calling
from
all
classes
admiration
and
praise
we
can
not
think
it
likely
that
so
great
perfection
will
ever
be
reached
again
in
those
figures
which
are
designed
to
represent
beauty
of
form
even
the
comparatively
few
statues
which
have
survived
the
wars
and
violence
of
two
thousand
years
convince
us
that
the
moderns
can
only
imitate
they
can
produce
no
creations
equal
to
those
by
athenian
artists
no
mechanical
copying
of
greek
statues
however
skilful
the
copyist
can
ever
secure
for
modern
sculpture
the
same
noble
and
effective
character
it
possessed
among
the
greeks
for
the
simple
reason
that
the
imitation
close
as
may
be
the
resemblance
is
but
the
result
of
the
eye
and
hand
while
the
original
is
the
expression
of
a
true
and
deeply
felt
sentiment
art
was
not
sustained
by
the
patronage
of
a
few
who
affect
to
have
what
is
called
in
greece
the
artist
having
a
common
feeling
for
the
beautiful
with
his
countrymen
produced
his
works
for
the
public
which
were
erected
in
places
of
honor
and
dedicated
in
temples
of
the
gods
it
was
not
until
the
persian
wars
awakened
among
the
greeks
the
slumbering
consciousness
of
national
power
and
athens
became
the
central
point
of
grecian
civilization
that
sculpture
like
architecture
and
painting
reached
its
culminating
point
of
excellence
under
phidias
and
his
contemporaries
great
artists
had
previously
made
themselves
famous
like
miron
polycletus
and
ageladas
but
the
great
riches
which
flowed
into
athens
at
this
time
gave
a
peculiar
stimulus
to
art
especially
under
the
encouragement
of
such
a
ruler
as
pericles
whose
age
was
the
golden
era
of
grecian
history
pheidias
or
phidias
was
to
sculpture
what
aeschylus
was
to
tragic
poetry
the
representative
of
the
sublime
and
grand
he
was
born
four
hundred
and
years
before
christ
and
was
the
pupil
of
ageladas
he
stands
at
the
head
of
the
ancient
sculptors
not
from
what
know
of
him
for
his
masterpieces
have
perished
but
from
the
estimation
in
which
he
was
held
by
the
greatest
critics
of
antiquity
it
was
to
him
that
pericles
intrusted
the
adornment
of
the
parthenon
and
the
numerous
and
beautiful
sculptures
of
the
frieze
and
the
pediment
were
the
work
of
artists
whom
he
directed
his
great
work
in
that
wonderful
edifice
was
the
statue
of
the
goddess
minerva
herself
made
of
gold
and
ivory
forty
feet
in
height
standing
victorious
with
a
spear
in
her
left
hand
and
an
image
of
victory
in
her
right
with
helmet
on
her
head
and
her
shield
resting
by
her
side
the
cost
of
this
statue
may
be
estimated
when
we
consider
that
the
gold
alone
used
upon
it
was
valued
at
talents
equal
to
five
hundred
thousand
dollars
of
our
money
an
immense
sum
in
that
age
some
critics
suppose
that
this
statue
was
overloaded
with
ornament
but
all
antiquity
was
unanimous
in
its
admiration
the
exactness
and
finish
of
detail
were
as
remarkable
as
the
grandeur
of
the
proportions
another
of
the
famous
works
of
phidias
was
a
colossal
bronze
statue
of
athene
promachos
sixty
feet
in
height
on
the
acropolis
between
the
propylaea
and
the
parthenon
but
both
of
these
yielded
to
the
colossal
statue
of
zeus
in
his
great
temple
at
olympia
represented
in
a
sitting
posture
forty
feet
high
on
a
pedestal
of
twenty
feet
the
god
was
seated
on
a
throne
ebony
gold
ivory
and
precious
stones
formed
with
a
multitude
of
sculptured
and
painted
figures
the
wonderful
composition
of
this
throne
in
this
his
greatest
work
the
artist
sought
to
embody
the
idea
of
majesty
and
repose
of
a
supreme
deity
no
longer
engaged
in
war
with
titans
and
giants
but
enthroned
as
a
conqueror
ruling
with
a
nod
the
subject
world
and
giving
his
blessing
to
those
victories
which
gave
glory
to
the
greeks
so
famous
was
this
statue
which
was
regarded
as
the
masterpiece
of
grecian
art
that
it
was
considered
a
calamity
to
die
without
having
seen
it
and
this
served
for
a
model
for
all
subsequent
representations
of
majesty
and
power
in
repose
among
the
ancients
it
was
removed
to
constantinople
by
theodosius
and
was
destroyed
by
fire
in
the
year
phidias
executed
various
other
famous
works
which
have
perished
but
even
those
that
were
executed
under
his
superintendence
which
have
come
down
to
our
times
like
the
statues
which
ornamented
the
pediment
of
the
parthenon
are
among
the
finest
specimens
of
art
that
exist
and
exhibit
the
most
graceful
and
appropriate
forms
which
could
have
been
selected
uniting
grandeur
with
simplicity
and
beauty
with
accuracy
of
anatomical
structure
his
distinguishing
excellence
was
ideal
beauty
and
that
of
the
sublimest
order
of
all
the
wonders
and
mysteries
of
ancient
art
the
colossal
statues
of
ivory
and
gold
were
perhaps
the
most
remarkable
and
the
difficulty
of
executing
them
has
been
set
forth
by
the
ablest
of
modern
critics
like
winckelmann
heyne
and
de
quincey
the
grandeur
of
their
dimensions
the
perfection
of
their
workmanship
the
richness
of
their
materials
their
majesty
beauty
and
ideal
truth
the
splendor
of
the
architecture
and
pictorial
decoration
with
which
they
were
associated
all
conspired
to
impress
the
beholder
with
wonder
and
awe
and
induce
a
belief
of
the
actual
presence
of
the
god
after
the
peloponnesian
war
a
new
school
of
art
arose
in
athens
which
appealed
more
to
the
passions
of
this
school
was
praxiteles
who
aimed
to
please
without
seeking
to
elevate
or
instruct
no
one
has
probably
ever
surpassed
him
in
execution
he
wrought
in
bronze
and
marble
and
was
one
of
the
artists
who
adorned
the
mausoleum
of
artemisia
without
attempting
the
sublime
impersonation
of
the
deity
in
which
phidias
excelled
he
was
unsurpassed
in
the
softer
graces
and
beauties
of
the
human
form
especially
in
female
figures
his
most
famous
work
was
an
undraped
statue
of
venus
for
his
native
town
of
cnidus
which
was
so
remarkable
that
people
flocked
from
all
parts
of
greece
to
see
it
he
did
not
aim
at
ideal
majesty
so
much
as
at
ideal
gracefulness
his
works
were
formed
from
the
most
beautiful
living
models
and
hence
expressed
only
the
ideal
of
sensuous
charms
it
is
probable
that
the
venus
de
medici
of
cleomenes
was
a
mere
copy
of
the
aphrodite
of
praxiteles
which
was
so
highly
extolled
by
the
ancient
authors
it
was
of
parian
marble
and
modelled
from
the
celebrated
phryne
his
statues
of
dionysus
also
expressed
the
most
consummate
physical
beauty
representing
the
god
as
a
beautiful
youth
crowned
with
ivy
and
expressing
tender
and
dreamy
emotions
praxiteles
sculptured
several
figures
of
eros
or
the
god
of
love
of
which
that
at
thespiae
attracted
visitors
to
the
city
in
the
time
of
cicero
it
was
subsequently
carried
to
rome
and
perished
by
a
conflagration
in
the
time
of
titus
one
of
the
most
celebrated
statues
of
this
artist
was
an
apollo
many
copies
of
which
still
exist
his
works
were
very
numerous
but
chiefly
from
the
circle
of
dionysus
aphrodite
and
eros
in
which
adoration
for
corporeal
attractions
is
the
most
marked
peculiarity
and
for
which
the
artist
was
fitted
by
his
dissolute
life
scopas
was
the
contemporary
of
praxiteles
and
was
the
author
of
the
celebrated
group
of
niobe
which
is
one
of
the
chief
ornaments
of
the
gallery
of
sculpture
at
florence
he
flourished
about
three
hundred
and
fifty
years
before
christ
and
wrought
chiefly
in
marble
he
was
employed
in
decorating
the
mausoleum
which
artemisia
erected
to
her
husband
one
of
the
wonders
of
the
world
his
masterpiece
is
said
to
have
been
a
group
representing
achilles
conducted
to
the
island
of
leuce
by
the
divinities
of
the
sea
which
ornamented
the
shrine
of
domitius
in
the
flaminian
circus
in
this
tender
grace
heroic
grandeur
daring
power
and
luxurious
fulness
of
life
were
combined
with
wonderful
harmony
like
the
other
great
artists
of
this
school
scopas
exhibited
the
grandeur
and
sublimity
for
which
phidias
was
celebrated
but
a
greater
refinement
and
luxury
as
well
as
skill
in
the
use
of
drapery
sculpture
in
greece
culminated
as
an
art
in
lysippus
who
worked
chiefly
in
bronze
he
is
said
to
have
executed
fifteen
hundred
statues
and
was
much
esteemed
by
alexander
the
great
by
whom
he
was
extensively
patronized
he
represented
men
not
as
they
were
but
as
they
appeared
to
be
and
if
he
exaggerated
he
displayed
great
energy
of
action
he
aimed
to
idealize
merely
human
beauty
and
his
imitation
of
nature
was
carried
out
in
the
minutest
details
none
of
his
works
are
extant
but
as
he
alone
was
permitted
to
make
the
statue
of
alexander
we
infer
that
he
had
no
equals
the
emperor
tiberius
transferred
one
of
his
statues
that
of
an
athlete
from
the
baths
of
agrippa
to
his
own
chamber
which
so
incensed
the
people
that
he
was
obliged
to
restore
it
his
favorite
subject
was
hercules
and
a
colossal
statue
of
this
god
was
carried
to
rome
by
fabius
maximus
when
he
took
tarentum
and
afterward
was
transferred
to
constantinople
the
farnese
hercules
and
the
belvidere
torso
are
probably
copies
of
this
work
he
left
many
eminent
scholars
among
whom
were
chares
who
executed
the
famous
colossus
of
rhodes
agesander
polydorus
and
athenodorus
who
sculptured
the
group
of
the
laocoön
the
rhodian
school
was
the
immediate
offshoot
from
the
school
of
lysippus
at
sicyon
and
from
this
small
island
of
rhodes
the
romans
when
they
conquered
it
carried
away
three
thousand
statues
the
colossus
was
one
of
the
wonders
of
the
world
seventy
cubits
in
height
and
the
laocoön
the
group
of
the
trojan
hero
and
his
two
sons
encoiled
by
serpents
is
a
perfect
miracle
of
art
in
which
pathos
is
exhibited
in
the
highest
degree
ever
attained
in
sculpture
it
was
discovered
in
near
the
baths
of
titus
and
is
one
of
the
choicest
remains
of
ancient
plastic
art
the
great
artists
of
antiquity
did
not
confine
themselves
to
the
representation
of
man
but
also
carved
animals
with
exceeding
accuracy
and
beauty
nicias
was
famous
for
his
dogs
myron
for
his
cows
and
lysippus
for
his
horses
praxiteles
composed
his
celebrated
lion
after
a
living
animal
the
horses
of
the
frieze
of
the
elgin
marbles
says
flaxman
appear
to
live
and
move
to
roll
their
eyes
to
gallop
prance
and
curvet
the
veins
of
their
faces
and
legs
seem
distended
with
circulation
the
beholder
is
charmed
with
the
lightness
and
elegance
of
their
make
and
although
the
relief
is
not
above
an
inch
from
the
background
and
they
are
so
much
smaller
than
nature
we
can
scarcely
suffer
reason
to
persuade
us
they
are
not
alive
the
greeks
also
carved
gems
cameos
medals
and
vases
with
unapproachable
excellence
very
few
specimens
have
come
down
to
our
times
but
those
which
we
possess
show
great
beauty
both
in
design
and
execution
grecian
statuary
began
with
ideal
representations
of
the
deities
and
was
carried
to
the
greatest
perfection
by
phidias
in
his
statues
of
jupiter
and
minerva
then
succeeded
the
school
of
praxiteles
in
which
the
figures
of
gods
and
goddesses
were
still
represented
but
in
mortal
forms
the
school
of
lysippus
was
famous
for
the
statues
of
celebrated
men
especially
in
cities
where
macedonian
rulers
resided
artists
were
expected
henceforth
to
glorify
kings
and
powerful
nobles
and
rulers
by
portrait
statues
from
this
period
however
plastic
art
degenerated
nor
were
works
of
original
genius
produced
but
rather
copies
or
varieties
from
the
three
great
schools
to
which
allusion
has
been
made
sculpture
may
have
multiplied
but
not
new
creations
although
some
imitations
of
great
merit
were
produced
like
the
hermaphrodite
the
torso
the
farnese
hercules
and
the
fighting
gladiator
when
corinth
was
sacked
by
mummius
some
of
the
finest
statues
of
greece
were
carried
to
rome
and
after
the
civil
war
between
caesar
and
pompey
the
greek
artists
emigrated
to
italy
the
fall
of
syracuse
introduced
many
works
of
priceless
value
into
rome
but
it
was
from
athens
delphi
corinth
elis
and
other
great
centres
of
art
that
the
richest
treasures
were
brought
greece
was
despoiled
to
ornament
italy
the
romans
did
not
create
a
school
of
sculpture
they
borrowed
wholly
from
the
greeks
yet
made
especially
in
the
time
of
hadrian
many
beautiful
statues
they
were
fond
of
this
art
and
all
eminent
men
had
statues
erected
to
their
memory
the
busts
of
emperors
were
found
in
every
great
city
and
rome
was
filled
with
statues
the
monuments
of
the
romans
were
even
more
numerous
than
those
of
the
greeks
and
among
them
some
admirable
portraits
are
found
these
sculptures
did
not
express
that
consummation
of
beauty
and
grace
of
refinement
and
sentiment
which
marked
the
greeks
but
the
imitations
were
good
art
had
reached
its
perfection
under
lysippus
there
was
nothing
more
to
learn
genius
in
that
department
could
soar
no
higher
it
will
never
rise
to
loftier
heights
it
is
noteworthy
that
the
purest
forms
of
grecian
art
arose
in
its
earlier
stages
from
a
moral
point
of
view
sculpture
declined
from
the
time
of
phidias
it
was
prostituted
at
rome
under
the
emperors
the
specimens
which
have
often
been
found
among
the
ruins
of
ancient
baths
make
us
blush
for
human
nature
the
skill
of
execution
did
not
decline
for
several
centuries
but
the
lofty
ideal
was
lost
sight
of
and
gross
appeals
to
human
passions
were
made
by
those
who
sought
to
please
corrupt
leaders
of
society
in
an
effeminate
age
the
turgidity
and
luxuriance
of
art
gradually
passed
into
tameness
and
poverty
the
reliefs
on
the
arch
of
constantine
are
rude
and
clumsy
compared
with
those
on
the
column
of
marcus
aurelius
it
is
not
my
purpose
to
describe
the
decline
of
art
or
enumerate
the
names
of
the
celebrated
masters
who
exalted
sculpture
in
the
palmy
days
of
pericles
or
even
alexander
i
simply
speak
of
sculpture
as
an
art
which
reached
a
great
perfection
among
the
greeks
and
romans
as
we
have
a
right
to
infer
from
the
specimens
that
have
been
preserved
how
many
more
must
have
perished
we
may
infer
from
the
criticisms
of
the
ancient
authors
the
finest
productions
of
our
own
age
are
in
a
measure
reproductions
they
can
not
be
called
creations
like
the
statue
of
the
olympian
jove
even
the
moses
of
michael
angelo
is
a
grecian
god
and
powers
greek
slave
is
a
copy
of
an
ancient
venus
the
very
tints
which
have
been
admired
in
some
of
the
works
of
modern
sculptors
are
borrowed
from
praxiteles
who
succeeded
in
giving
to
his
statues
an
appearance
of
living
flesh
the
museum
of
the
vatican
alone
contains
several
thousand
specimens
of
ancient
sculpture
which
have
been
found
among
the
débris
of
former
magnificence
many
of
which
are
the
productions
of
greek
artists
transported
to
rome
among
them
are
antique
copies
of
the
cupid
and
the
faun
of
praxiteles
the
statue
of
demosthenes
the
minerva
medica
the
athlete
of
lysippus
the
torso
belvedere
sculptured
by
apollonius
the
belvidere
antinous
of
faultless
anatomy
and
a
study
for
domenichino
the
laocoön
so
panegyrized
by
pliny
the
apollo
belvedere
the
work
of
agasias
of
ephesus
the
sleeping
ariadne
with
numerous
other
statues
of
gods
and
goddesses
emperors
philosophers
poets
and
statesmen
of
antiquity
the
dying
gladiator
which
ornaments
the
capitol
is
alone
a
magnificent
proof
of
the
perfection
to
which
sculpture
was
carried
centuries
after
the
art
had
culminated
at
athens
and
these
are
only
a
few
which
stand
out
among
the
twenty
thousand
recovered
statues
that
now
embellish
italy
to
say
nothing
of
those
that
are
scattered
over
europe
we
have
the
names
of
hundreds
of
artists
who
were
famous
in
their
day
not
merely
the
figures
of
men
are
chiselled
but
of
animals
and
plants
nature
in
all
her
forms
was
imitated
and
not
merely
nature
but
the
dresses
of
the
ancients
are
perpetuated
in
marble
no
modern
sculptor
has
equalled
in
delicacy
of
finish
the
draperies
of
those
ancient
statues
as
they
appear
to
us
even
after
the
exposure
and
accidents
of
two
thousand
years
no
one
after
a
careful
study
of
the
museums
of
europe
can
question
that
of
all
the
nations
who
have
claimed
to
be
civilized
the
ancient
greeks
and
romans
deserve
a
proud
in
an
art
which
is
still
regarded
as
among
the
highest
triumphs
of
human
genius
all
these
matchless
productions
of
antiquity
are
the
result
of
native
genius
alone
without
the
aid
of
christian
ideas
nor
with
the
aid
of
christianity
are
we
sure
that
any
nation
will
ever
soar
to
loftier
heights
than
did
the
greeks
in
that
proud
realm
which
was
consecrated
to
paganism
we
are
not
so
certain
in
regard
to
the
excellence
of
the
ancients
in
the
art
of
painting
as
we
are
in
regard
to
sculpture
and
architecture
since
so
few
specimens
of
painting
have
been
preserved
we
have
only
the
testimony
of
the
ancients
themselves
and
as
they
had
so
severe
a
taste
and
so
great
a
susceptibility
to
beauty
in
all
its
forms
we
can
not
suppose
that
their
notions
were
crude
in
this
great
art
which
the
moderns
have
carried
to
such
great
perfection
in
this
art
the
moderns
doubtless
excel
especially
in
perspective
and
drawing
and
light
and
shade
no
age
we
fancy
can
surpass
italy
in
the
fifteenth
and
sixteenth
centuries
when
the
genius
of
raphael
correggio
and
domenichino
blazed
with
such
wonderful
brilliancy
painting
in
some
form
however
is
very
ancient
though
not
so
ancient
as
are
the
temples
of
the
gods
and
the
statues
that
were
erected
to
their
worship
it
arose
with
the
susceptibility
to
beauty
of
form
and
color
and
with
the
view
of
conveying
thoughts
and
emotions
of
the
soul
by
imitation
of
their
outward
expression
the
walls
of
babylon
were
painted
after
nature
with
representations
of
different
species
of
animals
and
of
combats
between
them
and
man
semiramis
was
represented
as
on
horseback
striking
a
leopard
with
a
dart
and
her
husband
ninus
as
wounding
a
lion
ezekiel
describes
various
idols
and
beasts
portrayed
upon
the
walls
and
even
princes
painted
in
vermilion
with
girdles
around
their
loins
in
ages
almost
fabulous
there
were
some
rude
attempts
in
this
art
which
probably
arose
from
the
coloring
of
statues
and
reliefs
the
wooden
chests
of
egyptian
mummies
are
covered
with
painted
and
hieroglyphic
presentations
of
religious
subjects
but
the
colors
were
laid
without
regard
to
light
and
shade
the
egyptians
did
not
seek
to
represent
the
passions
and
emotions
which
agitate
the
soul
but
rather
to
authenticate
events
and
actions
and
hence
their
paintings
like
hieroglyphics
are
but
inscriptions
it
was
their
great
festivals
and
religious
rites
which
they
sought
to
perpetuate
not
ideas
of
beauty
or
of
grace
thus
their
paintings
abound
with
dismembered
animals
plants
and
flowers
with
censers
entrails
whatever
was
used
in
their
religious
worship
in
greece
also
the
original
painting
consisted
in
coloring
statues
and
reliefs
of
wood
and
clay
at
corinth
painting
was
early
united
with
the
fabrication
of
vases
on
which
were
rudely
painted
figures
of
men
and
animals
among
the
etruscans
before
rome
was
founded
it
is
said
there
were
beautiful
paintings
and
it
is
probable
that
these
people
were
advanced
in
art
before
the
greeks
there
were
paintings
in
some
of
the
old
etruscan
cities
which
the
roman
emperors
wished
to
remove
so
much
admired
were
they
even
in
the
days
of
the
greatest
splendor
the
ancient
etruscan
vases
are
famous
for
designs
which
have
never
been
exceeded
in
purity
of
form
but
it
is
probable
that
these
were
copied
from
the
greeks
whether
the
greeks
or
the
etruscans
were
the
first
to
paint
however
the
art
was
certainly
carried
to
the
greatest
perfection
among
the
former
the
development
of
it
was
like
all
arts
very
gradual
it
probably
began
by
drawing
the
outline
of
a
shadow
without
intermediate
markings
the
next
step
was
the
complete
outline
with
the
inner
markings
such
as
are
represented
on
the
ancient
vases
or
like
the
designs
of
flaxman
they
were
originally
practised
on
a
white
ground
then
light
and
shade
were
introduced
and
then
the
application
of
colors
in
accordance
with
nature
we
read
of
a
great
painting
by
bularchus
of
the
battle
of
magnete
purchased
by
a
king
of
lydia
seven
hundred
and
eighteen
years
before
christ
as
the
subject
was
a
battle
it
must
have
represented
the
movement
of
figures
although
we
know
nothing
of
the
coloring
or
of
the
real
excellence
of
the
work
except
that
the
artist
was
paid
munificently
cimon
of
cleona
is
the
first
great
name
connected
with
the
art
in
greece
he
is
praised
by
pliny
to
whom
we
owe
the
history
of
ancient
painting
more
than
to
any
other
author
cimon
was
not
satisfied
with
drawing
simply
the
outlines
of
his
figures
such
as
we
see
in
the
oldest
painted
vases
but
he
also
represented
limbs
and
folds
of
garments
he
invented
the
art
of
foreshortening
or
the
various
representations
of
the
diminution
of
the
length
of
figures
as
they
appear
when
looked
at
obliquely
and
hence
was
the
first
painter
of
perspective
he
first
made
muscular
articulations
indicated
the
veins
and
gave
natural
folds
to
drapery
a
much
greater
painter
than
he
was
polygnotus
of
thasos
the
contemporary
of
phidias
who
came
to
athens
about
the
year
one
of
the
greatest
geniuses
of
any
age
and
one
of
the
most
magnanimous
who
had
the
good
fortune
to
live
in
an
age
of
exceeding
intellectual
activity
he
painted
on
panels
which
were
afterward
let
into
the
walls
being
employed
on
the
public
buildings
of
athens
and
on
the
great
temple
of
delphi
the
hall
of
which
he
painted
gratuitously
he
also
decorated
the
propylaea
which
was
erected
under
the
superintendence
of
phidias
the
pictures
of
polygnotus
had
nothing
of
that
elaborate
grouping
aided
by
the
powers
of
perspective
so
much
admired
in
modern
art
his
greatness
lay
in
statuesque
painting
which
he
brought
nearly
to
perfection
by
ideal
expression
accurate
drawing
and
improved
coloring
he
used
but
few
colors
and
softened
the
rigidity
of
his
predecessors
by
making
the
mouth
of
beauty
smile
he
gave
great
expression
to
the
face
and
figure
and
his
pictures
were
models
of
excellence
for
the
beauty
of
the
eyebrows
the
blush
upon
the
cheeks
and
the
gracefulness
of
the
draperies
he
strove
like
phidias
to
express
character
in
repose
he
imitated
the
personages
and
the
subjects
of
the
old
mythology
and
treated
them
in
an
epic
spirit
his
subjects
being
almost
invariably
taken
from
homer
and
the
epic
cycle
among
the
works
of
polygnotus
as
mentioned
by
pliny
are
his
paintings
in
the
temple
at
delphi
in
the
propylaea
of
the
acropolis
in
the
temple
of
theseus
and
in
the
temple
of
the
dioscuri
at
athens
he
painted
in
a
truly
religious
spirit
and
upon
symmetrical
principles
with
great
grandeur
and
freedom
resembling
michael
angelo
more
than
any
other
modern
artist
the
use
of
oil
was
unknown
to
the
ancients
the
artists
painted
upon
wood
clay
plaster
stone
parchment
but
not
upon
canvas
which
was
not
used
till
the
time
of
nero
they
painted
upon
tablets
or
panels
and
not
upon
the
walls
the
panels
being
afterward
framed
and
encased
in
the
walls
the
stylus
or
cestrum
used
in
drawing
and
for
spreading
the
wax
colors
was
pointed
on
one
end
and
flat
on
the
other
and
generally
made
of
metal
wax
was
prepared
by
purifying
and
bleaching
and
then
mixed
with
colors
when
painting
was
practised
in
watercolors
glue
was
used
with
the
white
of
an
egg
or
with
gums
but
wax
and
resins
were
also
worked
with
water
with
certain
preparations
this
latter
mode
was
called
encaustic
and
was
according
to
plutarch
the
most
durable
of
all
methods
it
was
not
generally
adopted
till
the
time
of
alexander
the
great
wax
was
a
most
essential
ingredient
since
it
prevented
the
colors
from
cracking
encaustic
painting
was
practised
both
with
the
cestrum
and
the
pencil
and
the
colors
were
also
burned
in
fresco
or
on
fresh
plaster
was
used
for
coloring
walls
which
were
divided
into
compartments
or
panels
the
composition
of
the
stucco
and
the
method
of
preparing
the
walls
for
painting
is
described
by
the
ancient
writers
they
first
covered
the
walls
with
a
layer
of
ordinary
plaster
over
which
when
dry
were
successively
added
three
other
layers
of
a
finer
quality
mixed
with
sand
above
these
were
placed
three
layers
of
a
composition
of
chalk
and
the
upper
one
being
laid
on
before
the
under
one
was
dry
by
which
process
the
different
layers
were
so
bound
together
that
the
whole
mass
formed
one
beautiful
and
solid
slab
resembling
marble
and
was
capable
of
being
detached
from
the
wall
and
transported
in
a
wooden
frame
to
any
distance
the
colors
were
applied
when
the
composition
was
still
wet
the
fresco
wall
when
painted
was
covered
with
an
encaustic
varnish
both
to
heighten
the
color
and
to
preserve
it
from
the
effects
of
the
sun
or
the
weather
but
this
process
required
so
much
care
and
was
attended
with
so
much
expense
that
it
was
used
only
in
the
better
houses
and
palaces
the
later
discoveries
at
pompeii
show
the
same
correctness
of
design
in
painting
as
in
sculpture
and
also
considerable
perfection
in
coloring
the
great
artists
of
greece
phidias
and
euphranor
zeuxis
and
protogenes
polygnotus
and
lysippus
were
both
sculptors
and
painters
like
michael
angelo
and
the
ancient
writers
praise
the
paintings
of
these
great
artists
as
much
as
their
sculpture
the
aldobrandini
marriage
found
on
the
esquiline
mount
during
the
pontificate
of
clement
and
placed
in
the
vatican
by
pius
is
admired
both
for
drawing
and
color
polygnotus
was
praised
by
aristotle
for
his
designs
and
by
lucian
for
his
color
dionysius
and
mikon
were
the
great
contemporaries
of
polygnotus
the
former
being
celebrated
for
his
portraits
his
pictures
were
deficient
in
the
ideal
but
were
remarkable
for
expression
and
elegant
drawing
mikon
was
particularly
skilled
in
painting
horses
and
was
the
first
who
used
for
a
color
the
light
attic
ochre
and
the
black
made
from
burnt
he
painted
three
of
the
walls
of
the
temple
of
theseus
and
also
the
walls
of
the
temple
of
the
dioscuri
a
greater
painter
still
was
apollodorus
of
athens
through
his
labors
about
dramatic
effect
was
added
to
the
style
of
polygnotus
without
departing
from
his
pictures
as
models
the
acuteness
of
his
taste
says
fuseli
led
him
to
discover
that
as
all
men
were
connected
by
one
general
form
so
they
were
separated
each
by
some
predominant
power
which
fixed
character
and
bound
them
to
a
class
thence
he
drew
his
line
of
imitation
and
personified
the
central
form
of
the
class
to
which
his
object
belonged
and
to
which
the
rest
of
its
qualities
administered
without
being
absorbed
agility
was
not
suffered
to
destroy
firmness
solidity
or
weight
nor
strength
and
weight
agility
elegance
did
not
degenerate
into
effeminacy
nor
grandeur
swell
to
hugeness
his
aim
was
to
deceive
the
eye
of
the
spectator
by
the
semblance
of
reality
he
painted
men
and
things
as
they
really
appeared
he
also
made
a
great
advance
in
coloring
he
invented
other
painters
had
given
attention
to
the
proper
gradation
of
light
and
shade
he
heightened
this
effect
by
the
gradation
of
tints
and
thus
obtained
what
the
moderns
call
he
was
the
first
who
conferred
due
honor
on
the
pencil
gloriam
penicillo
jure
this
great
painter
was
succeeded
by
zeuxis
who
belonged
to
his
school
but
who
surpassed
him
in
the
power
to
give
ideal
form
to
rich
effects
he
began
his
great
career
four
hundred
and
years
before
christ
and
was
most
remarkable
for
his
female
figures
his
helen
painted
from
five
of
the
most
beautiful
women
of
croton
was
one
of
the
most
renowned
productions
of
antiquity
to
see
which
the
painter
demanded
money
he
gave
away
his
pictures
because
with
an
pride
he
maintained
that
their
price
could
not
be
estimated
there
is
a
tradition
that
zeuxis
laughed
himself
to
death
over
an
old
woman
painted
by
him
he
arrived
at
illusion
of
the
senses
regarded
as
a
high
attainment
in
art
as
in
the
instance
recorded
of
his
grapes
at
which
the
birds
pecked
he
belonged
to
the
asiatic
school
whose
headquarters
were
at
ephesus
the
peculiarities
of
which
were
accuracy
of
imitation
the
exhibition
of
sensuous
charms
and
the
gratification
of
sensual
tastes
he
went
to
athens
about
the
time
that
the
sculpture
of
phidias
was
completed
which
modified
his
style
his
marvellous
powers
were
displayed
in
the
contrast
of
light
and
shade
which
he
learned
from
apollodorus
he
gave
ideal
beauty
to
his
figures
but
it
was
in
form
rather
than
in
expression
he
taught
the
true
method
of
grouping
by
making
each
figure
the
perfect
representation
of
the
class
to
which
it
belonged
his
works
were
deficient
in
those
qualities
which
elevate
the
feelings
and
the
character
he
was
the
euripides
rather
than
the
homer
of
his
art
he
exactly
imitated
natural
objects
which
are
incapable
of
ideal
representation
his
works
were
not
so
numerous
as
they
were
perfect
in
their
way
in
some
of
which
as
in
the
infant
hercules
strangling
the
serpent
he
displayed
great
dramatic
power
lucian
highly
praises
his
female
centaur
as
one
of
the
most
remarkable
paintings
of
the
world
in
which
he
showed
great
ingenuity
of
contrasts
his
jupiter
enthroned
is
also
extolled
by
pliny
as
one
of
his
finest
works
zeuxis
acquired
a
great
fortune
and
lived
ostentatiously
contemporaneous
with
zeuxis
and
equal
in
fame
was
parrhasius
a
native
of
ephesus
whose
skill
lay
in
accuracy
of
drawing
and
power
of
expression
he
gave
to
painting
true
proportion
and
attended
to
minute
details
of
the
countenance
and
the
hair
in
his
gods
and
heroes
he
did
for
painting
what
phidias
did
in
sculpture
his
outlines
were
so
perfect
as
to
indicate
those
parts
of
the
figure
which
they
did
not
express
he
established
a
rule
of
proportion
which
was
followed
by
all
succeeding
artists
while
many
of
his
pieces
were
of
a
lofty
character
some
were
demoralizing
zeuxis
yielded
the
palm
to
him
since
parrhasius
painted
a
curtain
which
deceived
his
rival
whereas
the
grapes
of
zeuxis
had
deceived
only
birds
parrhasius
was
exceedingly
arrogant
and
luxurious
and
boasted
of
having
reached
the
utmost
limits
of
his
art
he
combined
the
magic
tone
of
apollodorus
with
the
exquisite
design
of
zeuxis
and
the
classic
expression
of
polygnotus
many
were
the
eminent
painters
that
adorned
the
fifth
century
before
christ
not
only
in
athens
but
in
the
ionian
cities
of
asia
timanthes
of
sicyon
was
distinguished
for
invention
and
eupompus
of
the
same
city
founded
a
school
his
advice
to
lysippus
is
memorable
let
nature
not
an
artist
be
your
model
protogenes
was
celebrated
for
his
high
finish
his
talissus
took
him
seven
years
to
complete
pamphilus
was
celebrated
for
composition
antiphilus
for
facility
theon
of
samos
for
prolific
fancy
apelles
for
grace
pausias
for
his
nicomachus
for
his
bold
and
rapid
pencil
aristides
for
depth
of
expression
the
art
probably
culminated
in
apelles
who
was
at
once
a
rich
colorist
and
portrayer
of
sensuous
charm
and
a
scientific
artist
while
he
added
a
peculiar
grace
of
his
own
which
distinguished
him
above
both
his
predecessors
and
contemporaries
he
was
contemporaneous
with
alexander
and
was
alone
allowed
to
paint
the
picture
of
the
great
conqueror
apelles
was
a
native
of
ephesus
studied
under
pamphilus
of
amphipolis
and
when
he
had
gained
reputation
he
went
to
sicyon
and
took
lessons
from
melanthius
he
spent
the
best
part
of
his
life
at
the
court
of
philip
and
alexander
and
painted
many
portraits
of
these
great
men
and
of
their
generals
he
excelled
in
portraits
and
labored
so
assiduously
to
perfect
himself
in
drawing
that
he
never
spent
a
day
without
practising
he
made
great
improvement
in
the
mechanical
part
of
his
art
inventing
some
colors
and
being
the
first
to
varnish
pictures
by
the
general
consent
of
ancient
authors
apelles
stands
at
the
head
of
all
the
painters
of
their
world
his
greatest
work
was
his
venus
anadyomene
or
venus
rising
out
of
the
sea
in
which
female
grace
was
personified
the
falling
drops
of
water
from
her
hair
gave
the
appearance
of
a
transparent
silver
veil
over
her
form
this
picture
cost
one
hundred
talents
was
painted
for
the
temple
of
aesculapius
at
cos
and
afterward
placed
by
augustus
in
the
temple
which
he
dedicated
to
julius
caesar
the
lower
part
of
it
becoming
injured
no
one
could
be
found
to
repair
it
nor
was
there
an
artist
who
could
complete
an
unfinished
picture
which
apelles
left
he
feared
no
criticism
and
was
unenvious
of
the
fame
of
rivals
after
apelles
the
art
of
painting
declined
although
great
painters
occasionally
appeared
especially
from
the
school
of
sicyon
which
was
renowned
for
nearly
two
hundred
years
the
destruction
of

by
mummius
gave
a
severe
blow
to
grecian
art
this
general
destroyed
or
carried
to
rome
more
works
than
all
his
predecessors
combined
sulla
when
he
spoiled
athens
inflicted
a
still
greater
injury
and
from
that
time
artists
resorted
to
rome
and
alexandria
and
other
flourishing
cities
for
patronage
and
remuneration
the
masterpieces
of
famous
artists
brought
enormous
prices
and
greece
and
asia
were
ransacked
for
old
pictures
the
paintings
which
aemilius
paulus
brought
from
greece
required
two
hundred
and
fifty
wagons
to
carry
them
in
the
triumphal
procession
with
the
spoliation
of
greece
the
migration
of
artists
began
and
this
spoliation
of
greece
asia
and
sicily
continued
for
two
centuries
we
have
already
said
that
such
was
the
wealth
of
rhodes
in
works
of
art
that
three
thousand
statues
were
found
there
by
the
conquerors
nor
could
there
have
been
less
at
athens
olympia
and
delphi
scaurus
had
all
the
public
pictures
of
sicyon
transported
to
rome
verres
plundered
every
temple
and
public
building
in
sicily
thus
rome
was
possessed
of
the
finest
paintings
in
the
world
without
the
slightest
claim
to
the
advancement
of
the
art
and
if
the
opinion
of
sir
joshua
reynolds
is
correct
art
could
advance
no
higher
in
the
realm
of
painting
as
well
as
of
statuary
than
the
greeks
had
already
borne
it
yet
the
romans
learned
to
place
as
high
value
on
the
works
of
grecian
genius
as
the
english
do
on
the
paintings
of
the
old
masters
of
italy
and
flanders
and
if
they
did
not
add
to
the
art
they
gave
such
encouragement
that
under
the
emperors
it
may
be
said
to
have
been
flourishing
varro
had
a
gallery
of
seven
hundred
portraits
of
eminent
men
the
portraits
as
well
as
the
statues
of
the
great
were
placed
in
the
temples
libraries
and
public
buildings
the
baths
especially
were
filled
with
paintings
the
great
masterpieces
of
the
greeks
were
either
historical
or
mythological
paintings
of
gods
and
heroes
groups
of
men
and
women
in
which
character
and
passion
could
be
delineated
were
the
most
highly
prized
it
was
in
the
expression
given
to
the
human
figure
in
beauty
of
form
and
countenance
in
which
all
the
emotions
of
the
soul
as
well
as
the
graces
of
the
body
were
portrayed
that
the
greek
artists
sought
to
reach
the
ideal
and
to
gain
immortality
and
they
painted
for
a
people
who
had
both
a
natural
and
a
cultivated
taste
and
sensibility
among
the
romans
portrait
decorative
and
scene
painting
engrossed
the
art
much
to
the
regret
of
such
critics
as
pliny
and
vitruvius
nothing
could
be
in
more
execrable
taste
than
a
colossal
painting
of
nero
one
hundred
and
twenty
feet
high
from
the
time
of
augustus
landscape
decorations
were
common
and
were
carried
out
with
every
species
of
license
among
the
greeks
we
do
not
read
of
landscape
painting
this
has
been
reserved
for
our
age
and
is
much
admired
as
it
was
at
rome
in
the
latter
days
of
the
empire
mosaic
work
of
inlaid
stones
or
composition
of
varying
shades
and
colors
gradually
superseded
painting
in
rome
it
was
first
used
for
floors
and
finally
walls
and
ceilings
were
ornamented
with
it
it
is
true
the
ancients
could
show
no
such
exquisite
perfection
of
colors
tints
and
shades
as
may
be
seen
in
the
wonderful
reproductions
of
paintings
on
the
walls
of
peter
at
rome
but
many
ancient
mosaics
have
been
preserved
which
attest
beauty
of
design
of
the
highest
character
like
the
battle
of
issus
lately
discovered
at
pompeii
and
this
brilliant
art
had
its
origin
and
a
splendid
development
at
the
hands
of
the
old
romans
thus
in
all
those
arts
of
which
modern
civilization
is
proudest
and
in
which
the
genius
of
man
has
soared
to
the
loftiest
heights
the
ancients
were
not
merely
our
equals
they
were
our
superiors
it
is
greater
to
originate
than
to
copy
in
architecture
in
sculpture
and
perhaps
in
painting
the
greeks
attained
absolute
perfection
any
architect
of
our
time
who
should
build
an
edifice
in
different
proportions
from
those
that
were
recognized
in
the
great
cities
of
antiquity
would
make
a
mistake
who
can
improve
upon
the
doric
columns
of
the
parthenon
or
upon
the
corinthian
capitals
of
the
temple
of
jupiter
indeed
it
is
in
proportion
as
we
accurately
copy
the
faultless
models
of
the
age
of
pericles
that
excellence
with
us
is
attained
and
recognized
when
we
differ
from
them
we
furnish
grounds
of
just
criticism
so
in
sculpture
the
finest
modern
works
are
inspired
by
antique
models
it
is
only
when
the
artist
seeks
to
bring
out
the
purest
and
loftiest
sentiments
of
the
soul
such
as
only
christianity
can
inspire
that
he
may
hope
to
surpass
the
sculpture
of
antiquity
in
one
department
of
that
art
alone
in
expression
rather
than
in
beauty
of
form
on
which
no
improvement
can
be
made
and
if
we
possessed
the
painted
venus
of
apelles
as
we
can
boast
of
having
the
sculptured
venus
of
cleomenes
we
should
probably
discover
greater
richness
of
coloring
as
well
as
grace
of
figure
than
appear
in
that
famous
picture
of
titian
which
is

any

such
as
they
made
in
the
field
of
letters
or
the
realm

it
is
in
science
especially
when
applied
to
practical
life
that
the
moderns
show
their
great
superiority
to
the
most
enlightened

great

modern
genius

it
is
this
which
most
strikingly
attests
the
advance
of
civilization
it
is
this
which
has

elevated
the
races
of
europe
and
carried
them
in
the
line
of
progress
beyond
the
attainments
of
the
greeks
and

with
the
magnificent
discoveries
and
inventions
of
the
last
three
hundred
years
in
almost
every
department

especially
in

in

in

in

our

to
cultivate
the

to

to

do

with

accuracy
of

orbits
to
use
the
sun
itself
in
perpetuating
our
likenesses
to
distant
generations
to
cause
a
needle
to
guide
the
mariner
with
assurance
on
the
darkest
night
to
propel
a
heavy
ship
against
wind
and

at

rate
of

miles
an

to
convey

with
the
speed
of

from

that
ancient
navigators
never
dared
to
cross
these
and
other
wonders
attest
an
ingenuity
and
audacity
of
intellect
which
would
have
overwhelmed
with
amazement
the
most
adventurous
of
greeks
and
the
most
potent
of
romans
but
the
great
discoveries
and
inventions
to
which
we
owe
this
marked
superiority
are
either
accidental
or
the
result
of
generations
of
experiment
assisted
by
an
immense
array
of
ascertained
facts
from
which
safe
inductions
can
be
made
it
is
not
probably
the
superiority
of
the
european
races
over
the
greeks
and
romans
to
which
we
may
ascribe
the
wonderful
advance
of
modern
society
but
the
particular
direction
which
genius
was
made
to
take
had
the
greeks
given
the
energy
of
their
minds
to
mechanical
forces
as
they
did
to
artistic
creations
they
might
have
made
wonderful
inventions
but
it
was
not
so
ordered
by
providence
at
that
time
the
world
was
not
in
the
stage
of
development
when
this
particular
direction
of
intellect
could
have
been
favored
the
development
of
the
physical
sciences
with
their
infinite
multiplicity
and
complexity
required
more
centuries
of
observation
collection
and
collation
of
facts
deductions
from
known
phenomena
than
the
ancients
had
had
to
work
with
while
the
more
ethereal
realms
of
philosophy
ethics
aesthetics
and
religion
though
needing
keen
study
of
nature
and
of
man
depended
more
upon
inner
spiritual
forces
and
less
upon
accumulated
detail
of
external
knowledge
yet
as
there
were
some
subjects
which
the
greeks
and
romans
seemed
to
exhaust
some
fields
of
labor
and
thought
in
which
they
never
have
been
and
perhaps
never
will
be
surpassed
so
some
future
age
may
direct
its
energies
into
channels
that
are
as
unknown
to
us
as
clocks
and
were
to
the
greeks
this
is
the
age
of
mechanism
and
of
science
and
mechanism
and
science
sweep
everything
before
them
and
will
probably
be
carried
to
their
utmost
capacity
and
development
after
that
the
human
mind
may
seek
some
new
department
some
new
scope
for
its
energies
and
an
age
of
new
wonders
may
arise
perhaps
after
the
present
dominant
races
shall
have
become
intoxicated
with
the
greatness
of
their
triumphs
and
have
shared
the
fate
of
the
old
monarchies
of
the
east
but
i
would
not
speculate
on
the
destinies
of
the
european
nations
whether
they
are
to
make
indefinite
advances
until
they
occupy
and
rule
the
whole
world
or
are
destined
to
be
succeeded
by
nations
as
yet
undeveloped
savages
as
their
fathers
were
when
rome
was
in
the
fulness
of
material
wealth
and
grandeur
i
have
shown
that
in
the
field
of
artistic
excellence
in
literary
composition
in
the
arts
of
government
and
legislation
and
even
in
the
realm
of
philosophical
speculation
the
ancients
were
our
and
that
among
them
were
some
men
of
most
marvellous
genius
who
have
had
no
superiors
among
us
but
we
do
not
see
among
them
the
exhibition
of
genius
in
what
we
call
science
at
least
in
its
application
to
practical
life
it
would
be
difficult
to
show
any
department
of
science
which
the
ancients
carried
to
any
considerable
degree
of
perfection
nevertheless
there
were
departments
in
which
they
made
noble
attempts
and
in
which
they
showed
large
capacity
even
if
they
were
unsuccessful
in
great
practical
results
astronomy
was
one
of
these
in
this
science
such
men
as
eratosthenes
aristarchus
hipparchus
and
ptolemy
were
great
lights
of
whom
humanity
may
be
proud
and
had
they
been
assisted
by
our
modern
inventions
they
might
have
earned
a
fame
scarcely
eclipsed
by
that
of
kepler
and
newton
the
old
astronomers
did
little
to
place
this
science
on
a
true
foundation
but
they
showed
great
ingenuity
and
discovered
some
truths
which
no
succeeding
age
has
repudiated
they
determined
the
circumference
of
the
earth
by
a
method
identical
with
that
which
would
be
employed
by
modern
astronomers
they
ascertained
the
position
of
the
stars
by
right
ascension
and
declination
they
knew
the
obliquity
of
the
ecliptic
and
determined
the
place
of
the
sun
apogee
as
well
as
its
mean
motion
their
calculations
on
the
eccentricity
of
the
moon
prove
that
they
had
a
rectilinear
trigonometry
and
tables
of
chords
they
had
an
approximate
knowledge
of
parallax
they
could
calculate
eclipses
of
the
moon
and
use
them
for
the
correction
of
their
lunar
tables
they
understood
spherical
trigonometry
and
determined
the
motions
of
the
sun
and
moon
involving
an
accurate
definition
of
the
year
and
a
method
of
predicting
eclipses
they
ascertained
that
the
earth
was
a
sphere
and
reduced
the
phenomena
of
the
heavenly
bodies
to
uniform
movements
of
circular
orbits
we
have
settled
by
physical
geography
the
exact
form
of
the
earth
but
the
ancients
arrived
at
their
knowledge
by
astronomical
reasoning
says
whewell
the
reduction
of
the
motions
of
the
sun
moon
and
five
planets
to
circular
orbits
as
was
done
by
hipparchus
implies
deep
concentrated
thought
and
scientific
abstraction
the
theories
of
eccentrics
and
epicycles
accomplished
the
end
of
explaining
all
the
known
phenomena
the
resolution
of
the
apparent
motions
of
the
heavenly
bodies
into
an
assemblage
of
circular
motions
was
a
great
triumph
of
genius
and
was
equivalent
to
the
most
recent
and
improved
processes
by
which
modern
astronomers
deal
with
such
motions
astronomy
was
probably
born
in
chaldaea
as
early
as
the
time
of
abraham
the
glories
of
the
firmament
were
impressed
upon
the
minds
of
the
rude
primitive
races
with
an
intensity
which
we
do
not
feel
with
all
the
triumphs
of
modern
science
the
chaldaean
shepherds
as
they
watched
their
flocks
by
night
noted
the
movements
of
the
planets
and
gave
names
to
the
more
brilliant
constellations
before
religious
rituals
were
established
before
great
superstitions
arose
before
poetry
was
sung
before
musical
instruments
were
invented
before
artists
sculptured
marble
or
melted
bronze
before
coins
were
stamped
before
temples
arose
before
diseases
were
healed
by
the
arts
of
medicine
before
commerce
was
known
those
oriental
shepherds
counted
the
anxious
hours
by
the
position
of
certain
constellations
astronomy
is
therefore
the
oldest
of
the
ancient
sciences
although
it
remained
imperfect
for
more
than
four
thousand
years
the
old
assyrians
egyptians
and
greeks
made
but
few
discoveries
which
are
valued
by
modern
astronomers
but
they
laid
the
foundation
of
the
science
and
ever
regarded
it
as
one
of
the
noblest
subjects
that
could
stimulate
the
faculties
of
man
it
was
invested
with
all
that
was
religious
and
poetical
the
spacious
level
and
unclouded
horizon
of
chaldaea
afforded
peculiar
facilities
of
observation
and
its
pastoral
and
contemplative
inhabitants
uncontaminated
by
the
vices
and
superstitions
of
subsequent
ages
and
fresh
discovered
after
a
long
observation
of
eclipses
some
say
extending
over
nineteen
centuries
the
cycle
of
two
hundred
and
lunations
which
brings
back
the
eclipses
in
the
same
order
having
once
established
their
cycle
they
laid
the
foundation
for
the
most
sublime
of
all
the
sciences
callisthenes
transmitted
from
babylon
to
aristotle
a
collection
of
observations
of
all
the
eclipses
that
preceded
the
conquests
of
alexander
together
with
the
definite
knowledge
which
the
chaldaeans
had
collected
about
the
motions
of
the
heavenly
bodies
such
knowledge
was
rude
and
simple
and
amounted
to
little
beyond
the
fact
that
there
were
spherical
revolutions
about
an
inclined
axis
and
that
the
poles
pointed
always
to
particular
stars
the
egyptians
also
recorded
their
observations
from
which
it
would
appear
that
they
observed
eclipses
at
least
sixteen
hundred
years
before
the
beginning
of
our
era
which
is
not
improbable
if
the
speculations
of
modern
philosophers
respecting
the
age
of
the
world
are
entitled
to
credit
the
egyptians
discovered
by
the
rising
of
sirius
that
the
year
consists
of
three
hundred
and
and
days
and
this
was
their
sacred
year
in
distinction
from
the
civil
which
consisted
of
three
hundred
and
days
they
also
had
observed
the
courses
of
the
planets
and
could
explain
the
phenomena
of
the
stations
and
retrogradations
and
it
is
asserted
too
that
they
regarded
mercury
and
venus
as
satellites
of
the
sun
some
have
maintained
that
the
obelisks
which
the
egyptians
erected
served
the
purpose
of
gnomons
for
determining
the
obliquity
of
the
ecliptic
the
altitude
of
the
pole
and
the
length
of
the
tropical
year
it
is
thought
even
that
the
pyramids
by
the
position
of
their
sides
toward
the
cardinal
points
attest
egyptian
acquaintance
with
a
meridional
line
the
chinese
boast
of
having
noticed
and
recorded
a
series
of
eclipses
extending
over
a
period
of
hundred
and
years
and
it
is
probable
that
they
anticipated
the
greeks
two
thousand
years
in
the
discovery
of
the
metonic
cycle
or
the
cycle
of
nineteen
years
at
the
end
of
which
time
the
new
moons
fall
on
the
same
days
of
the
year
the
chinese
also
determined
the
obliquity
of
the
ecliptic
eleven
hundred
years
before
our
era
the
hindus
at
a
remote
antiquity
represented
celestial
phenomena
with
considerable
exactness
and
constructed
tables
by
which
the
longitude
of
the
sun
and
moon
were
determined
and
dials
to
measure
time
bailly
thinks
that
hundred
and
two
years
before
christ
astronomy
was
cultivated
in
siam
which
hardly
yields
in
accuracy
to
that
which
modern
science
has
built
on
the
theory
of
universal
gravitation
but
the
greeks
after
all
were
the
only
people
of
antiquity
who
elevated
astronomy
to
the
dignity
of
a
science
they
however
confessed
that
they
derived
their
earliest
knowledge
from
the
babylonian
and
egyptian
priests
while
the
priests
of
thebes
claimed
to
be
the
originators
of
exact
astronomical
observations
diodorus
asserts
that
the
chaldaeans
used
the
temple
of
belus
in
the
centre
of
babylon
for
their
survey
of
the
heavens
but
whether
the
babylonians
or
the
egyptians
were
the
earliest
astronomers
is
of
little
consequence
although
the
pedants
make
it
a
grave
matter
of
investigation
all
we
know
is
that
astronomy
was
cultivated
by
both
babylonians
and
egyptians
and
that
they
made
but
very
limited
attainments
they
approximated
to
the
truth
in
reference
to
the
solar
year
by
observing
the
equinoxes
and
solstices
and
the
heliacal
rising
of
particular
stars
the
early
greek
philosophers
who
visited
egypt
and
the
east
in
search
of
knowledge
found
very
little
to
reward
their
curiosity
or
industry
not
much
beyond
preposterous
claims
to
a
high
antiquity
and
to
an
esoteric
wisdom
which
has
not
yet
been
revealed
plato
and
eudoxus
spent
thirteen
years
in
heliopolis
for
the
purpose
of
extracting
the
scientific
knowledge
of
the
egyptian
priests
yet
they
learned
but
little
beyond
the
fact
that
the
solar
year
was
a
trifle
beyond
three
hundred
and
days
no
great
names
have
come
down
to
us
from
the
priests
of
babylon
or
egypt
no
one
gained
an
individual
reputation
the
chaldaean
and
egyptian
priests
may
have
furnished
the
raw
material
of
observation
to
the
greeks
but
the
latter
alone
possessed
the
scientific
genius
by
which
undigested
facts
were
converted
into
a
symmetrical
system
the
east
never
gave
valuable
knowledge
to
the
west
it
gave
the
tendency
to
religious
mysticism
which
in
its
turn
tended
to
superstition
instead
of
astronomy
it
gave
astrology
instead
of
science
it
gave
magic
incantations
and
dreams
the
eastern
astronomers
connected
their
astronomy
with
divination
from
the
stars
and
made
their
antiquity
reach
back
to
two
hundred
and
seventy
thousand
years
there
were
soothsayers
in
the
time
of
daniel
and
magicians
exorcists
and
interpreters
of
signs
they
were
not
men
of
scientific
research
seeking
truth
it
was
power
they
sought
by
perverting
the
intellect
of
the
people
the
astrology
of
the
east
was
founded
on
the
principle
that
a
star
or
constellation
presided
over
the
birth
of
an
individual
and
that
it
either
portended
his
fate
or
shed
a
good
or
bad
influence
upon
his
future
life
the
star
which
looked
upon
a
child
at
the
hour
of
his
birth
was
called
the
horoscopus
and
the
peculiar
influence
of
each
planet
was
determined
by
the
astrologers
the
superstitions
of
egypt
and
chaldaea
unfortunately
spread
among
both
the
greeks
and
romans
and
these
were
about
all
that
the
western
nations
learned
from
the
boastful
priests
of
occult
oriental
science
whatever
was
known
of
real
value
among
the
ancients
is
due
to
the
earnest
inquiries
of
the
greeks
and
yet
their
researches
were
very
unsatisfactory
until
the
time
of
hipparchus
the
primitive
knowledge
was
almost
nothing
the
homeric
poems
regarded
the
earth
as
a
circular
plain
bounded
by
the
heaven
which
was
a
solid
vault
or
hemisphere
with
its
concavity
turned
downward
this
absurdity
was
believed
until
the
time
of
herodotus
five
centuries
after
nor
was
it
exploded
fully
in
the
time
of
aristotle
the
sun
moon
and
stars
were
supposed
to
move
upon
or
with
the
inner
surface
of
the
heavenly
hemisphere
and
the
ocean
was
thought
to
gird
the
earth
around
as
a
great
belt
into
which
the
heavenly
bodies
sank
at
night
homer
believed
that
the
sun
arose
out
of
the
ocean
ascended
the
heaven
and
again
plunged
into
the
ocean
passing
under
the
earth
and
producing
darkness
the
greeks
even
personified
the
sun
as
a
divine
charioteer
driving
his
fiery
steeds
over
the
steep
of
heaven
until
he
bathed
them
at
evening
in
the
western
waves
apollo
became
the
god
of
the
sun
as
diana
was
the
goddess
of
the
moon
but
the
early
greek
inquirers
did
not
attempt
to
explain
how
the
sun
found
his
way
from
the
west
back
again
to
the
east
they
merely
took
note
of
the
diurnal
course
the
alternation
of
day
and
night
the
number
of
the
seasons
and
their
regular
successions
they
found
the
points
of
the
compass
by
determining
the
recurrence
of
the
equinoxes
and
solstices
but
they
had
no
conception
of
the
ecliptic
of
that
great
circle
in
the
heaven
formed
by
the
sun
annual
course
and
of
its
obliquity
when
compared
with
our
equator
like
the
egyptians
and
babylonians
the
greeks
ascertained
the
length
of
the
year
to
be
three
hundred
and
days
but
perfect
accuracy
was
lacking
for
want
of
scientific
instruments
and
of
recorded
observations
of
the
heavenly
bodies
the
greeks
had
not
even
a
common
chronological
era
for
the
designation
of
years
herodotus
informs
us
that
the
trojan
war
preceded
his
time
by
eight
hundred
years
he
merely
states
the
interval
between
the
event
in
question
and
his
own
time
he
had
certain
data
for
distant
periods
the
greeks
reckoned
dates
from
the
trojan
war
and
the
romans
from
the
building
of
their
city
the
greeks
also
divided
the
year
into
twelve
months
and
introduced
the
intercalary
circle
of
eight
years
although
the
romans
disused
it
afterward
until
the
calendar
was
reformed
by
julius
caesar
thus
there
was
no
scientific
astronomical
knowledge
worth
mentioning
among
the
primitive
greeks
immense
research
and
learning
have
been
expended
by
modern
critics
to
show
the
state
of
scientific
astronomy
among
the
greeks
i
am
amazed
equally
at
the
amount
of
research
and
its
comparative
worthlessness
for
what
addition
to
science
can
be
made
by
an
enumeration
of
the
puerilities
and
errors
of
the
greeks
and
how
wasted
and
pedantic
the
learning
which
ransacks
all
antiquity
to
prove
that
the
greeks
adopted
this
or
that
absurdity
footnote
the
style
of
modern
historical
criticism
is
well

the
earliest
historic
name
associated
with

in

was
thales
the
founder
of
the
ionic
school
of
philosophers
he
is
reported
to
have
made
a
visit
to
egypt
to
have
fixed
the
year
at
three
hundred
and
days
to
have
determined
the
course
of
the
sun
from
solstice
to
solstice
and
to
have
calculated
eclipses
he
attributed
an
eclipse
of
the
moon
to
the
interposition
of
the
earth
between
the
sun
and
moon
and
an
eclipse
of
the
sun
to
the
interposition
of
the
moon
between
the
sun
and
earth
and
thus
taught
the
rotundity
of
the
earth
sun
and
moon
he
also
determined
the
ratio
of
the
sun
diameter
to
its
apparent
orbit
as
he
first
solved
the
problem
of
inscribing
a
triangle
in

circle
he
is
the
founder
of
geometrical
science
in

he
left
however
nothing

him

a

one
mentioned

this
says

was
probably
the
first
dial
on
record
and
is
one
hundred
and
forty
years
before
thales
and
nearly
four
hundred
before
plato
and
aristotle
and
just
a
little
previous
to
the
lunar
eclipses
observed
at
babylon
as
recorded
by
ptolemy
the
hebrew
word
for
this
dial
is
said
by
colonel
white
of
the
bengal
army
to
signify
a
which
much
strengthens
the
inference
that
it
was
like
the
equinoctial
dial
of
the
indian
nations
and
of
mesopotamia
from
whence
its
pattern
is
assumed
to
have
been
derived
anaximenes
of
miletus
taught
like
his
predecessors
crude
notions
of
the
sun
and
stars
and
speculated
on
the
nature
of
the
moon
but
did
nothing
to
advance
his
science
on
true
grounds
except
by
the
construction
of
the
same
may
be
said
of
heraclitus
xenophanes
parmenides
and
anaxagoras
they
were
great
men
but
they
gave
to
the
world
mere
speculations
some
of
which
are
very
puerile
they
all
held
to
the
idea
that
the
heavenly
bodies
revolved
around
the
earth
and
that
the
earth
was
a
plain
but
they
explained
eclipses
and
supposed
that
the
moon
derived
its
light
from
the
sun
some
of
them
knew
the
difference
between
the
planets
and
the
fixed
stars
anaxagoras
scouted
the
notion
that
the
sun
was
a
god
and
supposed
it
to
be
a
mass
of
ignited
stone
for
which
he
was
called
an
atheist
socrates
who
belonged
to
another
school
avoided
all
barren
speculations
concerning
the
universe
and
confined
himself
to
human
actions
and
interests
he
looked
even
upon
geometry
in
a
very
practical
way
valuing
it
only
so
far
as
it
could
be
made
serviceable
to
as
for
the
stars
and
planets
he
supposed
it
was
impossible
to
arrive
at
a
true
knowledge
of
them
and
regarded
speculations
upon
them
as
useless
it
must
be
admitted
that
the
greek
astronomers
however
barren
were
their
general
theories
laid
the
foundation
of
science
pythagoras
taught
the
obliquity
of
the
ecliptic
probably
learned
in
egypt
and
the
identity
of
the
morning
and
evening
stars
it
is
supposed
that
he
maintained
that
the
sun
was
the
centre
of
the
universe
and
that
the
earth
revolved
around
it
but
this
he
did
not
demonstrate
and
his
whole
system
was
unscientific
assuming
certain
arbitrary
principles
from
which
he
reasoned
deductively
he
assumed
that
fire
is
more
worthy
than
earth
that
the
more
worthy
place
must
be
given
to
the
more
worthy
that
the
extremity
is
more
worthy
than
the
intermediate
parts
and
hence
as
the
centre
is
an
extremity
the
place
of
fire
is
at
the
centre
of
the
universe
and
that
therefore
the
earth
and
other
heavenly
bodies
move
round
the
fiery
centre
but
this
was
no
heliocentric
system
since
the
sun
moved
like
the
earth
in
a
circle
around
the
central
fire
this
was
merely
the
work
of
the
imagination
utterly
unscientific
though
bold
and
original
nor
did
this
hypothesis
gain
credit
since
it
was
the
fixed
opinion
of
philosophers
that
the
earth
was
the
centre
of
the
universe
around
which
the
sun
moon
and
planets
revolved
but
the
pythagoreans
were
the
first
to
teach
that
the
motions
of
the
sun
moon
and
planets
are
circular
and
equable
their
idea
that
the
celestial
bodies
emitted
a
sound
and
were
combined
into
a
harmonious
symphony
was
exceedingly
crude
however
beautiful
the
music
of
the
spheres
belongs
to
poetry
as
well
as
to
the
speculations
of
plato
eudoxus
in
the
fifth
century
before
christ
contributed
to
science
by
making
a
descriptive
map
of
the
heavens
which
was
used
as
a
manual
of
sidereal
astronomy
to
the
sixth
century
of
our
era
the
error
of
only
one
hundred
and
ninety
days
in
the
periodic
time
of
saturn
shows
that
there
had
been
for
a
long
time
close
observations
aristotle
whose
comprehensive
intellect
like
that
of
bacon
took
in
all
forms
of
knowledge
condensed
all
that
was
known
in
his
day
into
a
treatise
concerning
the
heavens
he
regarded
astronomy
as
more
intimately
connected
with
mathematics
than
any
other
branch
of
science
but
even
he
did
not
soar
far
beyond
the
philosophers
of
his
day
since
he
held
to
the
immobility
of
the
earth
the
grand
error
of
the
ancients
some
few
speculators
in
science
like
heraclitus
of
pontus
and
hicetas
conceived
a
motion
of
the
earth
itself
upon
its
axis
so
as
to
account
for
the
apparent
motion
of
the
sun
but
they
also
thought
it
was
in
the
centre
of
the
universe
the
introduction
of
the
gnomon
and
dial
into
greece
advanced
astronomical
knowledge
since
they
were
used
to
determine
the
equinoxes
and
solstices
as
well
as
parts
of
the
day
meton
set
up
a
at
athens
in
the
year
but
the
length
of
the
hour
varied
with
the
time
of
the
year
since
the
greeks
divided
the
day
into
twelve
equal
parts
dials
were
common
at
rome
in
the
time
of
plautus
but
there
was
a
difficulty
in
using
them
since
they
failed
at
night
and
in
cloudy
weather
and
could
not
be
relied
on
hence
the
introduction
of
instead
aristarchus
is
said
to
have
combated
the
geocentric
theory
so
generally
received
by
philosophers
and
to
have
promulgated
the
hypothesis
that
the
fixed
stars
and
the
sun
are
immovable
that
the
earth
is
carried
round
the
sun
in
the
circumference
of
a
circle
of
which
the
sun
is
the
centre
and
that
the
sphere
of
the
fixed
stars
having
the
same
centre
as
the
sun
is
of
such
magnitude
that
the
orbit
of
the
earth
is
to
the
distance
of
the
fixed
stars
as
the
centre
of
the
sphere
of
the
fixed
stars
is
to
its
surface
aristarchus
also
according
to
plutarch
explained
the
apparent
annual
motion
of
the
sun
in
the
ecliptic
by
supposing
the
orbit
of
the
earth
to
be
inclined
to
its
axis
there
is
no
evidence
that
this
great
astronomer
supported
his
heliocentric
theory
with
any
geometrical
proof
although
plutarch
maintains
that
he
demonstrated
it
this
theory
gave
great
offence
especially
to
the
stoics
and
cleanthes
the
head
of
the
school
at
that
time
maintained
that
the
author
of
such
an
impious
doctrine
should
be
punished
aristarchus
left
a
treatise
on
the
magnitudes
and
distances
of
the
sun
and
moon
and
his
methods
to
measure
the
apparent
diameters
of
the
sun
and
moon
are
considered
theoretically
sound
by
modern
astronomers
but
practically
inexact
owing
to
defective
instruments
he
estimated
the
diameter
of
the
sun
at
the
seven
hundred
and
twentieth
part
of
the
circumference
of
the
circle
which
it
describes
in
its
diurnal
revolution
which
is
not
far
from
the
truth
but
in
this
treatise
he
does
not
allude
to
his
heliocentric
theory
archimedes
of
syracuse
born
is
stated
to
have
measured
the
distance
of
the
sun
moon
and
planets
and
he
constructed
an
orrery
in
which
he
exhibited
their
motions
but
it
was
not
in
the
grecian
colony
of
syracuse
but
of
alexandria
that
the
greatest
light
was
shed
on
astronomical
science
here
aristarchus
resided
and
also
eratosthenes
who
lived
between
the
years
and
the
latter
was
a
native
of
athens
but
was
invited
by
ptolemy
euergetes
to
alexandria
and
placed
at
the
head
of
the
library
his
great
achievement
was
the
determination
of
the
circumference
of
the
earth
this
was
done
by
measuring
on
the
ground
the
distance
between
syene
a
city
exactly
under
the
tropic
and
alexandria
situated
on
the
same
meridian
the
distance
was
found
to
be
five
thousand
stadia
the
meridional
distance
of
the
sun
from
the
zenith
of
alexandria
he
estimated
to
be
or
a
fiftieth
part
of
the
circumference
of
the
meridian
hence
the
circumference
of
the
earth
was
fixed
at
two
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
stadia
which
is
not
very
different
from
our
modern
computation
the
circumference
being
known
the
diameter
of
the
earth
was
easily
determined
the
moderns
have
added
nothing
to
this
method
he
also
calculated
the
diameter
of
the
sun
to
be
times
greater
than
that
of
the
earth
and
the
distance
of
the
sun
from
the
earth
to
be
eight
hundred
and
four
million
stadia
and
that
of
the
moon
seven
hundred
and
eighty
thousand
stadia
a
close
approximation
to
the
truth
astronomical
science
received
a
great
impulse
from
the
school
of
alexandria
the
greatest
light
of
which
was
hipparchus
who
flourished
early
in
the
second
century
before
christ
he
laid
the
foundation
of
astronomy
upon
a
scientific
basis
he
determined
says
delambre
the
position
of
the
stars
by
right
ascensions
and
declinations
and
was
acquainted
with
the
obliquity
of
the
ecliptic
he
determined
the
inequality
of
the
sun
and
the
place
of
its
apogee
as
well
as
its
mean
motion
the
mean
motion
of
the
moon
of
its
nodes
and
apogee
the
equation
of
the
moon
centre
and
the
inclination
of
its
orbit
he
calculated
eclipses
of
the
moon
and
used
them
for
the
correction
of
his
lunar
tables
and
he
had
an
approximate
knowledge
of
parallax
his
determination
of
the
motions
of
the
sun
and
moon
and
his
method
of
predicting
eclipses
evince
great
mathematical
genius
but
he
combined
with
this
determination
a
theory
of
epicycles
and
eccentrics
which
modern
astronomy
discards
it
was
however
a
great
thing
to
conceive
of
the
earth
as
a
solid
sphere
and
to
reduce
the
phenomena
of
the
heavenly
bodies
to
uniform
motions
in
circular
orbits
that
hipparchus
should
have
succeeded
in
the
first
great
steps
of
the
resolution
of
the
heavenly
bodies
into
circular
motions
is
a
circumstance
says
whewell
which
gives
him
one
of
the
most
distinguished
places
in
the
roll
of
great
astronomers
but
he
did
even
more
than
this
he
discovered
that
apparent
motion
of
the
fixed
stars
round
the
axis
of
the
ecliptic
which
is
called
the
precession
of
the
equinoxes
one
of
the
greatest
discoveries
in
astronomy
he
maintained
that
the
precession
was
not
greater
than
seconds
and
not
less
than
seconds
hipparchus
also
framed
a
catalogue
of
the
stars
and
determined
their
places
with
reference
to
the
ecliptic
by
their
latitudes
and
longitudes
altogether
he
seems
to
have
been
one
of
the
greatest
geniuses
of
antiquity
and
his
works
imply
a
prodigious
amount
of
calculation
astronomy
made
no
progress
for
three
hundred
years
although
it
was
expounded
by
improved
methods
posidonius
constructed
an
orrery
which
exhibited
the
diurnal
motions
of
the
sun
moon
and
five
planets
posidonius
calculated
the
circumference
of
the
earth
to
be
two
hundred
and
forty
thousand
stadia
by
a
different
method
from
eratosthenes
the
barrenness
of
discovery
from
hipparchus
to
ptolemy
the
alexandrian
mathematician
astronomer
and
geographer
in
the
second
century
of
the
christian
era
in
spite
of
the
patronage
of
the
royal
ptolemies
of
egypt
was
owing
to
the
want
of
instruments
for
the
accurate
measure
of
time
like
our
clocks
to
the
imperfection
of
astronomical
tables
and
to
the
want
of
telescopes
hence
the
great
greek
astronomers
were
unable
to
realize
their
theories
their
theories
however
were
magnificent
and
evinced
great
power
of
mathematical
combination
but
what
could
they
do
without
that
wondrous
instrument
by
which
the
human
eye
indefinitely
multiplies
its
power
moreover
the
ancients
had
no
accurate
almanacs
since
the
care
of
the
calendar
belonged
not
so
much
to
the
astronomers
as
to
the
priests
who
tampered
with
the
computation
of
time
for
sacerdotal
objects
the
calendars
of
different
communities
differed
hence
julius
caesar
rendered
a
great
service
to
science
by
the
reform
of
the
roman
calendar
which
was
exclusively
under
the
control
of
the
college
of
pontiffs
or
general
religious
overseers
the
roman
year
consisted
of
three
hundred
and
days
and
in
the
time
of
caesar
the
calendar
was
in
great
confusion
being
ninety
days
in
advance
so
that
january
was
an
autumn
month
he
inserted
the
regular
intercalary
month
of
days
and
two
additional
ones
of
days
these
together
with
ninety
days
were
added
to
three
hundred
and
days
making
a
year
of
transition
of
four
hundred
and
days
by
which
january
was
brought
back
to
the
first
month
in
the
year
after
the
winter
solstice
and
to
prevent
the
repetition
of
the
error
he
directed
that
in
future
the
year
should
consist
of
three
hundred
and
and
days
which
he
effected
by
adding
one
day
to
the
months
of
april
june
september
and
november
and
two
days
to
the
months
of
january
sextilis
and
december
making
an
addition
of
ten
days
to
the
old
year
of
three
hundred
and
and
he
provided
for
a
uniform
intercalation
of
one
day
in
every
fourth
year
which
accounted
for
the
remaining
quarter
of
a
day
caesar
was
a
student
of
astronomy
and
always
found
time
for
its
contemplation
he
is
said
even
to
have
written
a
treatise
on
the
motion
of
the
stars
he
was
assisted
in
his
reform
of
the
calendar
by
sosigines
an
alexandrian
astronomer
he
took
it
out
of
the
hands
of
the
priests
and
made
it
a
matter
of
pure
civil
regulation
the
year
was
defined
by
the
sun
and
not
as
before
by
the
moon
thus
the
romans
were
the
first
to
bring
the
scientific
knowledge
of
the
greeks
into
practical
use
but
while
they
measured
the
year
with
a
great
approximation
to
accuracy
they
still
used
and
to
measure
diurnal
time
yet
even
these
were
not
constructed
as
they
should
have
been
the
on
the
were
all
made
equal
instead
of
varying
with
the
periods
of
the
day
so
that
the
length
of
the
hour
varied
with
the
length
of
the
day
the
illuminated
interval
was
divided
into
twelve
equal
parts
so
that
if
the
sun
rose
at
five
and
set
at
eight
each
hour
was
equal
to
eighty
minutes
and
this
rude
method
of
measurement
of
diurnal
time
remained
in
use
till
the
sixth
century
clocks
with
wheels
and
weights
were
not
invented
till
the
twelfth
century
the
last
great
light
among
the
ancients
in
astronomical
science
was
ptolemy
who
lived
from
to
in
alexandria
he
was
acquainted
with
the
writings
of
all
the
previous
astronomers
but
accepted
hipparchus
as
his
guide
he
held
that
the
heaven
is
spherical
and
revolves
upon
its
axis
that
the
earth
is
a
sphere
and
is
situated
within
the
celestial
sphere
and
nearly
at
its
centre
that
it
is
a
mere
point
in
reference
to
the
distance
and
magnitude
of
the
fixed
stars
and
that
it
has
no
motion
he
adopted
the
views
of
the
ancient
astronomers
who
placed
saturn
jupiter
and
mars
next
under
the
sphere
of
the
fixed
stars
then
the
sun
above
venus
and
mercury
and
lastly
the
moon
next
to
the
earth
but
he
differed
from
aristotle
who
conceived
that
the
earth
revolves
in
an
orbit
around
the
centre
of
the
planetary
system
and
turns
upon
its
axis
two
ideas
in
common
with
the
doctrines
which
copernicus
afterward
unfolded
but
even
ptolemy
did
not
conceive
the
heliocentric
theory
the
sun
the
centre
of
our
system
archimedes
and
hipparchus
both
rejected
this
theory
in
regard
to
the
practical
value
of
the
speculations
of
the
ancient
astronomers
it
may
be
said
that
had
they
possessed
clocks
and
telescopes
their
scientific
methods
would
have
sufficed
for
all
practical
purposes
the
greatness
of
modern
discoveries
lies
in
the
great
stretch
of
the
perceptive
powers
and
the
magnificent
field
they
afford
for
sublime
contemplation
but
as
sir
cornewall
lewis
remarks
modern
astronomy
is
a
science
of
pure
curiosity
and
is
directed
exclusively
to
the
extension
of
knowledge
in
a
field
which
human
interests
can
never
enter
the
periodic
time
of
uranus
the
nature
of
saturn
ring
and
the
occultation
of
jupiter
satellites
are
as
far
removed
from
the
concerns
of
mankind
as
the
heliacal
rising
of
sirius
or
the
northern
position
of
the
great
bear
this
may
seem
to
be
a
utilitarian
view
with
which
those
philosophers
who
have
cultivated
science
for
its
own
sake
finding
in
the
same
a
sufficient
reward
can
have
no
sympathy
the
upshot
of
the
scientific
attainments
of
the
ancients
in
the
magnificent
realm
of
the
heavenly
bodies
would
seem
to
be
that
they
laid
the
foundation
of
all
the
definite
knowledge
which
is
useful
to
mankind
while
in
the
field
of
abstract
calculation
they
evinced
reasoning
and
mathematical
powers
that
have
never
been
surpassed
eratosthenes
archimedes
and
hipparchus
were
geniuses
worthy
to
be
placed
by
the
side
of
kepler
newton
and
la
place
and
all
ages
will
reverence
their
efforts
and
their
memory
it
is
truly
surprising
that
with
their
imperfect
instruments
and
the
absence
of
definite
data
they
reached
a
height
so
sublime
and
grand
they
explained
the
doctrine
of
the
sphere
and
the
apparent
motions
of
the
planets
but
they
had
no
instruments
capable
of
measuring
angular
distances
the
ingenious
epicycles
of
ptolemy
prepared
the
way
for
the
elliptic
orbits
and
laws
of
kepler
which
in
turn
conducted
newton
to
the
discovery
of
the
law
of
gravitation
the
grandest
scientific
discovery
in
the
annals
of
our
race
closely
connected
with
astronomical
science
was
geometry
which
was
first
taught
in
egypt
the
nurse
and
cradle
of
ancient
wisdom
it
arose
from
the
necessity
of
adjusting
the
landmarks
disturbed
by
the
inundations
of
the
nile
there
is
hardly
any
trace
of
geometry
among
the
hebrews
among
the
hindus
there
are
some
works
on
this
science
of
great
antiquity
their
mathematicians
knew
the
rule
for
finding
the
area
of
a
triangle
from
its
sides
and
also
the
celebrated
proposition
concerning
the
squares
on
the
sides
of
the
triangle
the
chinese
it
is
said
also
knew
this
proposition
before
it
was
known
to
the
greeks
among
whom
it
was
first
propounded
by
thales
he
applied
a
circle
to
the
measurement
of
angles
anaximander
made
geographical
charts
which
required
considerable
geometrical
knowledge
anaxagoras
employed
himself
in
prison
in
attempting
to
square
the
circle
thales
as
has
been
said
discovered
the
important
theorem
that
in
a
triangle
the
squares
on
the
sides
containing
the
right
angle
are
together
equal
to
the
square
on
the
opposite
side
of
it
pythagoras
discovered
that
of
all
figures
having
the
same
boundary
the
circle
among
plane
figures
and
the
sphere
among
solids
are
the
most
capacious
hippocrates
treated
of
the
duplication
of
the
cube
and
wrote
elements
of
geometry
and
knew
that
the
area
of
a
circle
was
equal
to
a
triangle
whose
base
is
equal
to
its
circumference
and
altitude
equal
to
its
radius
the
disciples
of
plato
invented
conic
sections
and
discovered
the
geometrical
foci
it
was
however
reserved
for
euclid
to
make
his
name
almost
synonymous
with
geometry
he
was
born
and
belonged
to
the
platonic
sect
which
ever
attached
great
importance
to
mathematics
his
elements
are
still
in
use
as
nearly
perfect
as
any
human
production
can
be
they
consist
of
thirteen
books
the
first
four
are
on
plane
geometry
the
fifth
is
on
the
theory
of
proportion
and
applies
to
magnitude
in
general
the
seventh
eighth
and
ninth
are
on
arithmetic
the
tenth
on
the
arithmetical
characteristics
of
the
division
of
a
straight
line
the
eleventh
and
twelfth
on
the
elements
of
solid
geometry
the
thirteenth
on
the
regular
solids
these
elements
soon
became
the
universal
study
of
geometers
throughout
the
civilized
world
they
were
translated
into
the
arabic
and
through
the
arabians
were
made
known
to
mediaeval
europe
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
this
work
is
one
of
the
highest
triumphs
of
human
genius
and
it
has
been
valued
more
than
any
single
monument
of
antiquity
it
is
still
a
in
various
english
translations
in
all
our
schools
euclid
also
wrote
various
other
works
showing
great
mathematical
talent
perhaps
a
greater
even
than
euclid
was
archimedes
born
he
wrote
on
the
sphere
and
cylinder
terminating
in
the
discovery
that
the
solidity
and
surface
of
a
sphere
are
two
thirds
respectively
of
the
solidity
and
surface
of
the
circumscribing
cylinder
he
also
wrote
on
conoids
and
spheroids
the
properties
of
the
spiral
and
the
quadrature
of
the
parabola
were
added
to
ancient
geometry
by
archimedes
the
last
being
a
great
step
in
the
progress
of
the
science
since
it
was
the
first
curvilineal
space
legitimately
squared
modern
mathematicians
may
not
have
the
patience
to
go
through
his
investigations
since
the
conclusions
he
arrived
at
may
now
be
reached
by
shorter
methods
but
the
great
conclusions
of
the
old
geometers
were
reached
by
only
prodigious
mathematical
power
archimedes
is
popularly
better
known
as
the
inventor
of
engines
of
war
and
of
various
ingenious
machines
than
as
a
mathematician
great
as
were
his
attainments
in
this
direction
his
theory
of
the
lever
was
the
foundation
of
statics
till
the
discovery
of
the
composition
of
forces
in
the
time
of
newton
and
no
essential
addition
was
made
to
the
principles
of
the
equilibrium
of
fluids
and
floating
bodies
till
the
time
of
stevin
in
archimedes
detected
the
mixture
of
silver
in
a
crown
of
gold
which
his
patron
hiero
of
syracuse
ordered
to
be
made
and
he
invented
a
for
pumping
water
out
of
the
hold
of
a
great
ship
which
he
had
built
he
contrived
also
the
combination
of
pulleys
and
he
constructed
an
orrery
to
represent
the
movement
of
the
heavenly
bodies
he
had
an
extraordinary
inventive
genius
for
discovering
new
provinces
of
inquiry
and
new
points
of
view
for
old
and
familiar
objects
like
newton
he
had
a
habit
of
abstraction
from
outward
things
and
would
forget
to
take
his
meals
he
was
killed
by
roman
soldiers
when
syracuse
was
taken
and
the
sicilians
so
soon
forgot
his
greatness
that
in
the
time
of
cicero
they
did
not
know
where
his
tomb
was
eratosthenes
was
another
of
the
famous
geometers
of
antiquity
and
did
much
to
improve
geometrical
analysis
he
was
also
a
philosopher
and
geographer
he
gave
a
solution
of
the
problem
of
the
duplication
of
the
cube
and
applied
his
geometrical
knowledge
to
the
measurement
of
the
magnitude
of
the
earth
being
one
of
the
first
who
brought
mathematical
methods
to
the
aid
of
astronomy
which
in
our
day
is
almost
exclusively
the
province
of
the
mathematician
apollonius
of
perga
probably
about
forty
years
younger
than
archimedes
and
his
equal
in
mathematical
genius
was
the
most
fertile
and
profound
writer
among
the
ancients
who
treated
of
geometry
he
was
called
the
great
geometer
his
most
important
work
is
a
treatise
on
conic
sections
which
was
regarded
with
unbounded
admiration
by
contemporaries
and
in
some
respects
is
unsurpassed
by
any
thing
produced
by
modern
mathematicians
he
however
made
use
of
the
labors
of
his
predecessors
so
that
it
is
difficult
to
tell
how
far
he
is
original
but
all
men
of
science
must
necessarily
be
indebted
to
those
who
have
preceded
them
even
homer
in
the
field
of
poetry
made
use
of
the
bards
who
had
sung
for
a
thousand
years
before
him
and
in
the
realms
of
philosophy
the
great
men
of
all
ages
have
built
up
new
systems
on
the
foundations
which
others
have
established
if
plato
or
aristotle
had
been
contemporaries
with
thales
would
they
have
matured
so
wonderful
a
system
of
dialectics
yet
if
thales
had
been
contemporaneous
with
plato
he
might
have
added
to
the
great
athenian
sublime
science
even
more
than
did
aristotle
so
of
the
great
mathematicians
of
antiquity
they
were
all
wonderful
men
and
worthy
to
be
classed
with
the
newtons
and
keplers
of
our
times
considering
their
means
and
the
state
of
science
they
made
as
though
not
as
discoveries
discoveries
which
show
patience
genius
and
power
of
calculation
apollonius
was
one
of
these
one
of
the
master
intellects
of
antiquity
like
euclid
and
archimedes
one
of
the
master
intellects
of
all
ages
like
newton
himself
i
might
mention
the
subjects
of
his
various
works
but
they
would
not
be
understood
except
by
those
familiar
with
mathematics
other
famous
geometers
could
also
be
named
but
such
men
as
euclid
archimedes
and
apollonius
are
enough
to
show
that
geometry
was
cultivated
to
a
great
extent
by
the
philosophers
of
antiquity
it
progressively
advanced
like
philosophy
itself
from
the
time
of
thales
until
it
had
reached
the
perfection
of
which
it
was
capable
when
it
became
merged
into
astronomical
science
it
was
cultivated
more
particularly
by
the
disciples
of
plato
who
placed
over
his
school
this
inscription
let
no
one
ignorant
of
geometry
enter
here
he
believed
that
the
laws
by
which
the
universe
is
governed
are
in
accordance
with
the
doctrines
of
mathematics
the
same
opinion
was
shared
by
pythagoras
the
great
founder
of
the
science
whose
main
formula
was
that
is
the
essence
or
first
principle
of
all
things
no
thinkers
ever
surpassed
the
greeks
in
originality
and
profundity
and
mathematics
being
highly
prized
by
them
were
carried
to
the
greatest
perfection
their
method
would
allow
they
did
not
understand
algebra
by
the
application
of
which
to
geometry
modern
mathematicians
have
climbed
to
greater
heights
than
the
ancients
but
then
it
is
all
the
more
remarkable
that
without
the
aid
of
algebraic
analysis
they
were
able
to
solve
such
difficult
problems
as
occupied
the
minds
of
archimedes
and
apollonius
no
positive
science
can
boast
of
such
rapid
development
as
geometry
for
two
or
three
hundred
years
before
christ
and
never
was
the
intellect
of
man
more
severely
tasked
than
by
the
ancient
mathematicians
no
empirical
science
can
be
carried
to
perfection
by
any
one
nation
or
in
any
particular
epoch
it
can
only
expand
with
the
progressive
developments
of
the
human
race
itself
nevertheless
in
that
science
which
for
three
thousand
years
has
been
held
in
the
greatest
honor
and
which
is
one
of
the
three
great
liberal
professions
of
our
modern
times
the
ancients
especially
the
greeks
made
considerable
advance
the
science
of
medicine
having
in
view
the
amelioration
of
human
misery
and
the
prolongation
of
life
itself
was
very
early
cultivated
it
was
indeed
in
old
times
another
word
for
the
science
of
nature
and
the
was
the
observer
and
expounder
of
physics
the
physician
was
supposed
to
be
acquainted
with
the
secrets
of
nature
that
is
the
knowledge
of
drugs
of
poisons
of
antidotes
to
them
and
the
way
to
administer
them
he
was
also
supposed
to
know
the
process
of
preserving
the
body
after
death
thus
joseph
seventeen
hundred
years
before
the
birth
of
christ
commanded
his
physician
to
embalm
the
body
of
his
father
and
the
process
of
embalming
was
probably
known
to
the
egyptians
before
the
period
when
history
begins
helen
of
trojan
fame
put
into
wine
a
drug
that
frees
man
from
grief
and
anger
and
causes
oblivion
of
all
ills
solomon
was
a
great
botanist
a
realm
with
which
the
science
of
medicine
is
indissolubly
connected
the
origin
of
hindu
medicine
is
lost
in
remote
antiquity
the
ayur
veda
written
nine
hundred
years
before
hippocrates
was
born
sums
up
the
knowledge
of
previous
periods
relating
to
obstetric
surgery
to
general
pathology
to
the
treatment
of
insanity
to
infantile
diseases
to
toxicology
to
personal
hygiene
and
to
diseases
of
the
generative
functions
thus
hippocrates
the
father
of
european
medicine
must
have
derived
his
knowledge
not
merely
from
his
own
observations
but
from
the
writings
of
men
unknown
to
us
and
from
systems
practised
for
an
indefinite
period
the
real
founders
of
greek
medicine
are
fabled
characters
like
hercules
and
aesculapius
that
is
benefactors
whose
fictitious
names
alone
have
descended
to
us
they
are
mythical
personages
like
hermes
and
chiron
twelve
hundred
years
before
christ
temples
were
erected
to
aesculapius
in
greece
the
priests
of
which
were
really
physicians
and
the
temples
themselves
hospitals
in
them
were
practised
rites
apparently
mysterious
but
which
modern
science
calls
by
the
names
of
mesmerism
hydropathy
the
use
of
mineral
springs
and
other
essential
elements
of
empirical
science
and
these
temples
were
also
medical
schools
that
of
cos
gave
birth
to
hippocrates
and
it
was
there
that
his
writings
were
begun
pythagoras
for
those
old
grecian
philosophers
were
the
fathers
of
all
wisdom
and
knowledge
in
mathematics
and
empirical
sciences
as
well
as
philosophy
itself
studied
medicine
in
the
schools
of
egypt
phoenicia
chaldaea
and
india
and
came
in
conflict
with
sacerdotal
power
which
has
ever
been
antagonistic
to
new
ideas
in
science
he
travelled
from
town
to
town
as
a
teacher
or
lecturer
establishing
communities
in
which
as
well
as
was
taught
the
greatest
name
in
medical
science
in
ancient
or
in
modern
times
the
man
who
did
the
most
to
advance
it
the
greatest
medical
genius
of
whom
we
have
any
early
record
was
hippocrates
born
on
the
island
of
cos
of
the
great
aesculapian
family
he
received
his
instruction
from
his
father
we
know
scarcely
more
of
his
life
than
we
do
of
homer
himself
although
he
lived
in
the
period
of
the
highest
splendor
of
athens
even
his
writings
like
those
of
homer
are
thought
by
some
to
be
the
work
of
different
men
they
were
translated
into
arabic
and
were
no
slight
means
of
giving
an
impulse
to
the
saracenic
schools
of
the
middle
ages
in
that
science
in
which
the
saracens
especially
excelled
the
hippocratic
collection
consists
of
more
than
sixty
works
which
were
held
in
the
highest
estimation
by
the
ancient
physicians
hippocrates
introduced
a
new
era
in
medicine
which
before
his
time
had
been
monopolized
by
the
priests
he
carried
out
a
system
of
severe
induction
from
the
observation
of
facts
and
is
as
truly
the
creator
of
the
inductive
method
as
bacon
himself
he
abhorred
theories
which
could
not
be
established
by
facts
he
was
always
open
to
conviction
and
candidly
confessed
his
mistakes
he
was
conscientious
in
the
practice
of
his
profession
and
valued
the
success
of
his
art
more
than
silver
and
gold
the
athenians
revered
hippocrates
for
his
benevolence
as
well
as
genius
the
great
principle
of
his
practice
was
in
hence
he
was
accused
of
allowing
his
patients
to
die
but
this
principle
has
many
advocates
among
scientific
men
in
our
day
and
some
suppose
that
the
whole
successful
practice
of
homoeopathy
rests
on
the
primal
principle
which
hippocrates
advanced
although
the
philosophy
of
it
claims
a
distinctly
scientific
basis
in
the
principle
similibus
hippocrates
had
great
skill
in
diagnosis
by
which
medical
genius
is
most
severely
tested
his
practice
was
cautious
and
timid
in
contrast
with
that
of
his
contemporaries
he
is
the
author
of
the
celebrated
maxim
life
is
short
and
art
is
long
he
divides
the
causes
of
disease
into
two
principal
classes
the
one
comprehending
the
influence
of
seasons
climates
and
other
external
forces
the
other
including
the
effects
of
food
and
exercise
to
the
influence
of
climate
he
attributes
the
conformation
of
the
body
and
the
disposition
of
the
mind
to
a
vicious
system
of
diet
he
attributes
innumerable
forms
of
disease
for
more
than
twenty
centuries
his
pathology
was
the
foundation
of
all
the
medical
sects
he
was
well
acquainted
with
the
medicinal
properties
of
drugs
and
was
the
first
to
assign
three
periods
to
the
course
of
a
malady
he
knew
but
little
of
surgery
although
he
was
in
the
habit
of
bleeding
and
often
employed
the
knife
he
was
also
acquainted
with
cupping
and
used
violent
purgatives
he
was
not
aware
of
the
importance
of
the
pulse
and
confounded
the
veins
with
the
arteries
hippocrates
wrote
in
the
ionic
dialect
and
some
of
his
works
have
gone
through
three
hundred
editions
so
highly
have
they
been
valued
his
authority
passed
away
like
that
of
aristotle
on
the
revival
of
science
in
europe
yet
who
have
been
greater
ornaments
and
lights
than
these
two
distinguished
greeks
the
school
of
alexandria
produced
eminent
physicians
as
well
as
mathematicians
after
the
glory
of
greece
had
departed
so
highly
was
it
esteemed
that
galen
in
the
second
century
born
in
greece
but
famous
in
the
service
of
rome
went
there
to
study
five
hundred
years
after
its
foundation
it
was
distinguished
for
inquiries
into
scientific
anatomy
and
physiology
for
which
aristotle
had
prepared
the
way
galen
was
the
humboldt
of
his
day
and
gave
great
attention
to
physics
in
eight
books
he
developed
the
general
principles
of
natural
science
known
to
the
greeks
on
the
basis
of
the
aristotelian
researches
the
alexandrian
physicians
carried
out
extensive
inquiries
in
physiology
herophilus
discovered
the
fundamental
principles
of
neurology
and
advanced
the
anatomy
of
the
brain
and
spinal
cord
although
the
romans
had
but
little
sympathy
with
science
or
philosophy
being
essentially
political
and
warlike
in
their
turn
of
mind
yet
when
they
had
conquered
the
world
and
had
turned
their
attention
to
arts
medicine
received
a
good
share
of
their
attention
the
first
physicians
in
rome
were
greek
slaves
of
these
was
asclepiades
who
enjoyed
the
friendship
of
cicero
it
is
from
him
that
the
popular
medical
theories
as
to
the
pores
have
descended
he
was
the
inventor
of
the
celsus
wrote
a
work
on
medicine
which
takes
almost
equal
rank
with
the
hippocratic
writings
medical
science
at
rome
culminated
in
galen
as
it
did
at
athens
in
hippocrates
galen
was
patronized
by
marcus
aurelius
and
availed
himself
of
all
the
knowledge
of
preceding
naturalists
and
physicians
he
was
born
at
pergamos
about
the
year
where
he
learned
under
able
masters
anatomy
pathology
and
therapeutics
he
finished
his
studies
at
alexandria
and
came
to
rome
at
the
invitation
of
the
emperor
like
his
imperial
patron
galen
was
one
of
the
brightest
ornaments
of
the
heathen
world
and
one
of
the
most
learned
and
accomplished
men
of
any
age
he
left
five
hundred
treatises
most
of
them
relating
to
some
branch
of
medical
science
which
give
him
the
name
of
being
one
of
the
most
voluminous
of
authors
his
celebrity
is
founded
chiefly
on
his
anatomical
and
physiological
works
he
was
familiar
with
practical
anatomy
deriving
his
knowledge
from
dissection
his
observations
about
health
are
practical
and
useful
he
lays
great
stress
on
gymnastic
exercises
and
recommends
the
pleasures
of
the
chase
the
cold
bath
in
hot
weather
hot
baths
for
old
people
the
use
of
wine
and
three
meals
a
day
the
great
principles
of
his
practice
were
that
disease
is
to
be
overcome
by
that
which
is
contrary
to
the
disease
itself
hence
the
name
allopathy
invented
by
the
founder
of
homoeopathy
to
designate
the
fundamental
principle
of
the
general
practice
and
that
nature
is
to
be
preserved
by
that
which
has
relation
with
nature
his
commentaries
on
hippocrates
served
as
a
treasure
of
medical
criticism
from
which
succeeding
annotators
borrowed
no
one
ever
set
before
the
medical
profession
a
higher
standard
than
galen
advanced
and
few
have
more
nearly
approached
it
he
did
not
attach
himself
to
any
particular
school
but
studied
the
doctrines
of
each
the
works
of
galen
constituted
the
last
production
of
ancient
roman
medicine
and
from
his
day
the
decline
in
medical
science
was
rapid
until
it
was
revived
among
the
arabs
the
physical
sciences
it
must
be
confessed
were
not
carried
by
the
ancients
to
any
such
length
as
geometry
and
astronomy
in
physical
geography
they
were
particularly
deficient
yet
even
this
branch
of
knowledge
can
boast
of
some
eminent
names
when
men
sailed
timidly
along
the
coasts
and
dared
not
explore
distant
seas
the
true
position
and
characteristics
of
countries
could
not
be
ascertained
with
the
definiteness
that
it
is
at
present
but
geography
was
not
utterly
neglected
in
those
early
times
nor
was
natural
history
herodotus
gives
us
most
valuable
information
respecting
the
manners
and
customs
of
oriental
and
barbarous
nations
and
pliny
wrote
a
natural
history
in
books
which
is
compiled
from
upwards
of
two
thousand
volumes
and
refers
to
twenty
thousand
matters
of
importance
he
was
born
and
was
when
the
eruption
of
vesuvius
took
place
which
caused
his
death
pliny
can
not
be
called
a
scientific
genius
in
the
sense
understood
by
modern
savants
nor
was
he
an
original
observer
his
materials
being
drawn
up
like
a
modern
encyclopaedia
nor
did
he
evince
great
judgment
in
his
selection
he
had
a
great
love
of
the
marvellous
and
his
work
was
often
unintelligible
but
it
remains
a
wonderful
monument
of
human
industry
his
natural
history
treats
of
everything
in
the
natural
world
of
the
heavenly
bodies
of
the
elements
of
thunder
and
lightning
of
the
winds
and
seasons
of
the
changes
and
phenomena
of
the
earth
of
countries
and
nations
of
seas
and
rivers
of
men
animals
birds
fishes
and
plants
of
minerals
and
medicines
and
precious
stones
of
commerce
and
the
fine
arts
he
is
full
of
errors
but
his
work
is
among
the
most
valuable
productions
of
antiquity
buffon
pronounced
his
natural
history
to
contain
an
infinity
of
knowledge
in
every
department
of
human
occupation
conveyed
in
a
dress
ornate
and
brilliant
it
is
a
literary
rather
than
a
scientific
monument
and
as
such
it
is
wonderful
in
strict
scientific
value
it
is
inferior
to
the
works
of
modern
research
but
there
are
few
minds
even
in
these
times
who
have
directed
inquiries
to
such
a
variety
of
subjects
as
are
treated
in
masterpiece
if
we
would
compare
the
geographical
knowledge
of
the
ancients
with
that
of
the
moderns
we
confess
to
the
immeasurable
inferiority
of
the
ancients
eratosthenes
though
more
properly
an
astronomer
and
the
most
distinguished
among
the
ancients
was
also
a
considerable
writer
on
geography
indeed
the
first
who
treated
the
subject
systematically
although
none
of
his
writings
have
reached
us
the
improvements
he
pointed
out
were
applied
by
ptolemy
himself
his
work
was
a
presentation
of
the
geographical
knowledge
known
in
his
day
so
far
as
geography
is
the
science
of
determining
the
position
of
places
on
the
surface
when
eratosthenes
began
his
labors
in
the
third
century
before
christ
it
was
known
that
the
surface
of
the
earth
was
spherical
he
established
parallels
of
latitude
and
longitude
and
attempted
the
difficult
undertaking
of
measuring
the
circumference
of
the
globe
by
the
actual
measurement
of
a
segment
of
one
of
its
great
circles
hipparchus
beginning
of
second
century
before
christ
introduced
into
geography
a
great
improvement
namely
the
relative
situation
of
places
by
the
same
process
that
he
determined
the
positions
of
the
heavenly
bodies
he
also
pointed
out
how
longitude
might
be
determined
by
observing
the
eclipses

and

this
led
to
the
construction
of
maps
but
none
have
reached
us
except
those
that
were
used
to
illustrate
the
geography
of
ptolemy
hipparchus
was
the
first
who
raised
geography
to
the
rank
of
a
science
he
starved
himself
to
death
being
tired
of
life
posidonius
who
was
nearly
a
century
later
determined
the
arc
of
a
meridian
between
rhodes
and
alexandria
to
be
a
part
of
the
whole
circumference
an
enormous
calculation
yet
a
remarkable
one
in
the
infancy
of
astronomical
science
his
writings
on
history
and
geography
are
preserved
only
in
quotations
by
cicero
strabo
and
others
geographical
knowledge
however
was
most
notably
advanced
by
strabo
who
lived
in
the
augustan
era
although
his
researches
were
chiefly
confined
to
the
roman
empire
strabo
was
like
herodotus
a
great
traveller
and
much
of
his
geographical
information
is
the
result
of
his
own
observations
it
is
probable
he
was
much
indebted
to
eratosthenes
who
preceded
him
by
three
centuries
the
authorities
of
strabo
were
chiefly
greek
but
his
work
is
defective
from
the
imperfect
notions
which
the
ancients
had
of
astronomy
so
that
the
determination
of
the
figure
by
the
measure
of
latitude
and
longitude
the
essential
foundation
of
geographical
description
was
unknown
the
enormous
strides
which
all
forms
of
physical
science
have
made
since
the
discovery
of
america
throw
all
ancient
descriptions
and
investigations
into
the
shade
and
strabo
appears
at
as
great
disadvantage
as
pliny
or
ptolemy
yet
the
work
of
strabo
considering
his
means
and
the
imperfect
knowledge
of
the
earth
surface
and
astronomical
science
in
his
day
was
really
a
great
achievement
he
treats
of
the
form
and
magnitude
of
the
earth
and
devotes
eight
books
to
europe
six
to
asia
and
one
to
africa
the
description
of
places
belongs
to
strabo
whose
work
was
accepted
as
the
of
the
science
till
the
fifteenth
century
for
in
his
day
the
roman
empire
had
been
well
surveyed
he
maintained
that
the
earth
is
spherical
and
established
the
terms
and
which
eratosthenes
had
introduced
and
computed
the
earth
to
be
one
hundred
and
eighty
thousand
stadia
in
circumference
and
a
degree
to
be
five
hundred
stadia
in
length
or
and
roman
miles
his
estimates
of
the
length
of
a
degree
of
latitude
were
nearly
correct
but
he
made
great
errors
in
the
degrees
of
longitude
making
the
length
of
the
world
from
east
to
west
too
great
which
led
to
the
belief
in
the
practicability
of
a
western
passage
to
india
he
also
assigned
too
great
length
to
the
mediterranean
arising
from
the
difficulty
of
finding
the
longitude
with
accuracy
but
it
was
impossible
with
the
scientific
knowledge
of
his
day
to
avoid
errors
and
we
are
surprised
that
he
made
so
few
whatever
may
be
said
of
the
accuracy
of
the
great
geographer
of
antiquity
it
can
not
be
denied
that
he
was
a
man
of
immense
research
and
learning
his
work
in
seventeen
books
is
one
of
the
most
valuable
that
have
come
down
from
antiquity
both
from
the
discussions
which
run
through
it
and
the
curious
facts
which
can
be
found
nowhere
else
it
is
scarcely
fair
to
estimate
the
genius
of
strabo
by
the
correctness
and
extent
of
his
geographical
knowledge
all
men
are
comparatively
ignorant
in
science
because
science
is
confessedly
a
progressive
study
the
great
scientific
lights
of
our
day
may
be
insignificant
compared
with
those
who
are
to
arise
if
profundity
and
accuracy
of
knowledge
be
made
the
test
it
is
the
genius
of
the
ancients
their
grasp
and
power
of
mind
their
original
labors
which
we
are
to
consider
thus
it
would
seem
that
among
the
ancients
in
those
departments
of
science
which
are
inductive
there
were
not
sufficient
facts
well
established
from
which
to
make
sound
inductions
but
in
those
departments
which
are
deductive
like
pure
mathematics
and
which
require
great
reasoning
powers
there
were
lofty
attainments
which
indeed
gave
the
foundation
for
the
achievements
of
modern
science

more
was
accomplished
by
the

for
the

of

than

naturally
might

egypt
was
the

of

were

there
when
the
rest
of

was
still
in

and
barbarism
more
than
four
thousand
years
ago
the
egyptians
had
chariots
of
war
and
most
of
the
military
weapons
known
afterward
to
the
greeks
especially
the
spear
and
bow
which
were
the
most
effective
offensive
weapons
known
to
antiquity
or
the
middle
ages
some
of
their
warriors
were
clothed
in
coats
of
brass
equal
to
the

cuirass
worn
by
the

twenty
thousand

they
erected

they
engraved
the
sides
of
these
obelisks
from

they
ornamented
their

and
were
one
hundred

twenty
feet
in

among
their

the
egyptians
used
the

kind
of
buckets
for

that
we
find
among
the
farmhouses
of
new
england
skilful
gardeners
were
employed
in

by
the
egyptians
in

greatly
surpassed
that
known
to
modern
farmers
according
to
wilkinson
they
caught
fish
in
nets
equal
to
the
seines
employed
by
modern
fishermen
their
houses
as
well
as
their

were
built
of
brick
and
were
sometimes
four
or
five
stories
in
height
and
secured
by
bolts
on
the
doors
locks
and
keys
were
also
in
use
made
of

and
the
doorways
were
ornamented
some
of
the
roofs
of
their
public
buildings
were
arched
with
stone
in
their
mills
for
grinding
wheat
circular
stones
were
used
resembling
in
form
those
now
employed
generally
turned
by
women
but
sometimes
so
large
that
asses
and
mules
were
employed
in
the
work
the
walls
and
ceilings
of
their
buildings
were
richly
painted
the
devices
being
as
elaborate
as
those
of
the
greeks
besides
the

villas
and
gardens
where
they
amused
themselves
with
angling
and
spearing

were
laid
in

earthen
jars
corresponding
to
the

of
the
romans
and
covered
with
lids
made
by

the
egyptians
had
several
kinds
of
wine
highly
praised
by
the
ancients

abundant
egypt
was
also
renowned
for

unknown
to
other
nations

so
fond
were
the
egyptians
of

flowers
that
they
exacted
a
contribution
from
the
nations
tributary
to
them
of
their
rarest
plants
so
that
their
gardens
bloomed
with
flowers
of
every
variety
in
all
seasons
of
the

wreaths
and
chaplets
were
in
common
use
from
the
earliest
antiquity
it
was
in
their
gardens
abounding
with
vegetables
as
well
as
with
fruits
and
flowers
that
the
egyptians
entertained
their
friends
in
egyptian
houses
were
handsome
chairs
and
fauteuils
stools
and
couches
the
legs
of
which
were
carved
in
imitation
of
the
feet
of
animals
and
these
were
made
of
rare
woods
inlaid
with
ivory
and
covered
with
rich

some
of
the
egyptian
chairs
were
furnished
with
cushions
and
covered
with
the
skins
of
leopards
and
lions
the
seats
were
made
of
leather
painted
with

footstools
were
sometimes
made
of
elegant

mats
were
used
in

utilized
in
some
instances

were
round
square

were
sometimes
made
of

highly
ornamented
with

conspicuous
they
also
perfumed
the

were
the

music
was
looked
upon
by

as
an
important
science

were
united
with
the
sounds

many
of
the

were
not
inferior
in
elegance
of

finely
carved

all
dating

these

with
admirably
fitting
lids
representing
fishes
birds

the
rings
bracelets
and
other
articles
of
jewelry
that
have
been
preserved
show
great
facility
on
the
part
of
the
egyptians
in
cutting
the
hardest
stones
the
skill
displayed
in
the
sculptures
on
the
hard
obelisks
and
granite
monuments
of
egypt
was
remarkable
since
they
were
executed
with
hardened
bronze
was
another
art
in
which
the
egyptians
excelled
fifteen
hundred
years
before
christ
they
made
ornaments
of
glass
and
glass
vessels
of
large
size
were
used
for
holding
wine
such
was
their
skill
in
the
manufacture
of
glass
that
they
counterfeited
precious
stones
with
a
success
unknown
to
the
moderns
we
read
of
a
counterfeited
emerald
six
feet
in
length
counterfeited
necklaces
were
sold
at
thebes
which
deceived
strangers
the
uses
to
which
glass
was
applied
were
in
the
manufacture
of
bottles
beads
mosaic
work
and
and
their
different
colors
show
considerable
knowledge
of
chemistry
the
art
of
cutting
and
engraving
stones
was
doubtless
learned
by
the
israelites
in
their
sojourn
in
egypt
so
perfect
were
the
egyptians
in
the
arts
of
cutting
precious
stones
that
they
were
sought
by
foreign
merchants
and
they
furnished
an
important
material
in
commerce
from
the
earliest
times
the
egyptians
were
celebrated
for
their
manufacture
of
linen
which
was
one
of
the
principal
articles
of
commerce
and
cotton
and
woollen
cloths
as
well
as
linen
were
woven
cotton
was
used
not
only
for
articles
of
dress
but
for
the
covering
of
chairs
and
other
kinds
of
furniture
the
great
mass
of
the
mummy
cloths
is
of
coarse
texture
but
the
fine
linen
spoken
of
in
the
scripture
was
as
fine
as
muslin
in
some
instances
containing
more
than
five
hundred
threads
to
an
inch
while
the
finest
productions
of
the
looms
of
india
have
only
one
hundred
threads
to
the
inch
not
only
were
the
threads
of
linen
cloth
of
extraordinary
fineness
but
the
dyes
were
equally
remarkable
and
were
unaffected
by
strong
alkalies
spinning
was
principally
the
occupation
of
women
who
also
practised
the
art
of
embroidery
in
which
gold
thread
was
used
supposed
to
be
beaten
out
by
the
hammer
but
in
the
arts
of
dyeing
and
embroidery
the
egyptians
were
surpassed
by
the
babylonians
who
were
renowned
for
their
cloths
of
various
colors
the
manufacture
of
paper
was
another
art
for
which
the
egyptians
were
famous
made
from
the
papyrus
a
plant
growing
in
the
of
the
nile
the
papyrus
was
also
applied
to
the
manufacture
of
sails
baskets
canoes
and
parts
of
sandals
some
of
the
papyri
on
which
is
hieroglyphic
writing
dating
from
two
thousand
years
before
our
era
are
in
good
preservation
parchment
also
was
used
for
writing
the
egyptians
were
especially
skilled
in
the
preparation
of
leather
for
sandals
shields
and
chairs
the
curriers
used
the
same
semicircular
knife
which
is
now
in
use
the
great
consumption
of
leather
created
a
demand
far
greater
than
could
be
satisfied
by
the
produce
of
the
country
and
therefore
skins
from
foreign
countries
were
imported
as
part
of
the
tribute
laid
on
conquered
nations
or
tribes
more
numerous
than
the
tanners
in
egypt
were
the
potters
among
whom
the
was
known
from
a
remote
antiquity
previous
to
the
arrival
of
joseph
from
canaan
and
long
before
the
foundation
of
the
greek
athens
earthenware
was
used
for
holding
wine
oils
and
other
liquids
but
the
finest
production
of
the
potter
were
the
vases
covered
with
a
vitreous
glaze
and
modelled
in
every
variety
of
forms
some
of
which
were
as
elegant
as
those
made
later
by
the
greeks
who
excelled
in
this
department
of
art
carpenters
and
formed
a
large
class
of
egyptian
workmen
for
making
coffins
boxes
tables
chairs
doors
sofas
and
other
articles
of
furniture
frequently
inlaid
with
ivory
and
rare
woods
veneering
was
known
to
these
workmen
probably
arising
from
the
scarcity
of
wood
the
tools
used
by
the
carpenters
as
appear
from
the
representations
on
the
monuments
were
the
axe
the
adze
the
the
chisel
the
drill
and
the
plane
these
tools
were
made
of
bronze
with
handles
of
acacia
tamarisk
and
other
hard
woods
the
hatchet
by
which
trees
were
felled
was
used
by
the
boxes
and
other
articles
of
furniture
were
highly
ornamented
with
inlaid
work
in
egypt
also
employed
many
workmen
boats
were
made
of
the
papyrus
plant
deal
cedar
and
other
woods
and
were
propelled
both
by
sails
and
oars
one
built
for
ptolemy
philopater
is
said
by
ancient
writers
to
have
been
feet
long
to
have
had
forty
banks
of
oars
and
to
have
carried
sailors
rowers
and
soldiers
this
is
doubtless
an
exaggeration
but
indicates
great
progress
in
naval
architecture
the
construction
of
boats
varied
according
to
the
purpose
for
which
they
were
intended
they
were
built
with
ribs
as
at
the
present
day
with
small
keels
square
sails
with
spacious
cabins
in
the
centre
and
ornamented
sterns
there
was
usually
but
one
mast
and
the
prows
terminated
in
the
heads
of
animals
the
boats
of
burden
were
somewhat
similar
to
our
barges
the
sails
were
generally
painted
with
rich
colors
the
origin
of
was
probably
the
raft
and
improvement
followed
improvement
until
the
rivalled
in
size
our
largest
vessels
while
egyptian
merchant
vessels
penetrated
to
distant
seas
and
probably
doubled
the
cape
of
good
hope
in
regard
to
agriculture
the
egyptians
were
the
most
advanced
of
the
nations
of
antiquity
since
the
fertility
of
their
soil
made
the
occupation
one
of
primary
importance
irrigation
was
universally
practised
the
nile
furnishing
water
for
innumerable
canals
the
soil
was
often
turned
up
with
the
hoe
rather
than
the
plough
the
grain
was
sown
broadcast
and
was
trodden
in
by
goats
their
plough
was
very
simple
and
was
drawn
by
oxen
the
yoke
being
attached
to
the
horns
although
the
soil
was
rich
manures
were
frequently
used
the
chief
crops
were
those
of
wheat
barley
beans
peas
lentils
vetches
lupines
clover
rice
indigo
cotton
lettuce
flax
hemp
cumin
coriander
poppy
melons
cucumbers
onions
and
leeks
we
do
not
read
of
carrots
cabbages
beets
or
potatoes
which
enter
so
largely
into
modern
husbandry
oil
was
obtained
from
the
olive
the
simsin
and
coleseed
among
the
principal
trees
which
were
cultivated
were
the
vine
olive
locust
acacia
date
sycamore
pomegranate
and
tamarisk
grain
after
harvest
was
trodden
out
by
oxen
and
the
straw
was
used
as
provender
to
protect
the
fields
from
inundation
dykes
were
built
all
classes
in
egypt
delighted
in
the
sports
of
the
field
especially
in
the
hunting
of
wild
animals
in
which
the
arrow
was
most
frequently
used
sometimes
the
animals
were
caught
in
nets
in
enclosed
places
near
the
egyptians
also
had
numerous
since
they
were
as
fond
of
angling
as
they
were
of
hunting
hunting
in
egypt
was
an
amusement
not
an
occupation
as
among
nomadic
people
not
only
was
hunting
for
pleasure
a
great
amusement
among
egyptians
but
also
among
babylonians
and
persians
who
coursed
the
plains
with
dogs
they
used
the
noose
or
lasso
also
to
catch
antelopes
and
wild
cattle
which
were
hunted
with
lions
the
bow
used
in
the
chase
was
similar
to
that
employed
in
war
all
the
subjects
of
the
chase
were
sculptured
on
the
monuments
with
great
spirit
and
fidelity
especially
the
stag
the
ibex
the
porcupine
the
wolf
the
hare
the
lion
the
fox
and
the
giraffe
the
camel
is
not
found
among
the
egyptian
sculptures
nor
the
bear
of
the
birds
found
in
their
sculptures
were
vultures
eagles
kites
hawks
owls
ravens
larks
swallows
quails
ostriches
storks
plovers
snipes
geese
and
ducks
many
of
which
were
taken
in
nets
the
nile
and
lake
birket
el
keroun
furnished
fish
in
great
abundance
the
profits
of
the
fisheries
were
enormous
and
were
farmed
out
by
the
government
the
egyptians
were
very
fond
of
ornaments
in
dress
especially
the
women
they
paid
great
attention
to
their
sandals
they
wore
their
hair
long
and
plaited
bound
round
with
an
ornamented
fillet
fastened
by
a
lotus
bud
they
wore
and
a
profusion
of
rings
on
the
fingers
and
bracelets
for
the
arms
made
of
gold
and
set
with
precious
stones
the
scarabaeus
or
sacred
beetle
was
the
adornment
of
rings
and
necklaces
even
the
men
wore
necklaces
and
rings
and
chains
both
men
and
women
stained
the
eyelids
and
brows
pins
and
needles
were
among
the
articles
of
the
toilet
usually
made
of
bronze
also
metallic
mirrors
finely
polished
the
men
carried
canes
or
the
wands
of
moses
and
aaron
as
the
egyptians
paid
great
attention
to
health
physicians
were
held
in
great
repute
and
none
were
permitted
to
practise
but
in
some
particular
branch
such
as
diseases
of
the
eye
the
ear
the
head
the
teeth
and
the
internal
maladies
they
were
paid
by
government
and
were
skilled
in
the
knowledge
of
drugs
the
art
of
curing
diseases
originated
according
to
pliny
in
egypt
connected
with
the
healing
art
was
the
practice
of
embalming
dead
bodies
which
was
carried
to
great
perfection
in
elegance
of
life
the
greeks
and
romans
however
far
surpassed
any
of
the
nations
of
antiquity
if
not
in
luxury
itself
which
was
confined
to
the
palaces
of
kings
in
social
refinements
the
greeks
were
not
behind
any
modern
nation
as
one
infers
from
reading
becker
charicles
among
the
greeks
was
the
network
of
trades
and
professions
as
in
paris
and
london
and
a
complicated
social
life
in
which
all
the
amenities
known
to
the
modern
world
were
seen
especially
in
athens
and
corinth
and
the
ionian
capitals
what
could
be
more
polite
and
courteous
than
the
intercourse
carried
on
in
greece
among
cultivated
and
famous
people
when
were
symposia
more
attractive
than
when
the
of
athens
in
the
time
of
pericles
feasted
and
communed
together
when
was
art
ever
brought
in
support
of
luxury
to
greater
perfection
we
read
of
libraries
and
books
and

of
social
games
of
attractive
gardens
and
villas
as
well
as
of
baths
and
spectacles
of
markets
and
fora
in
athens
the
common
life
of
a
pericles
or
a
cicero
differed
but
little
from
that
of
modern
men
of
rank
and
fortune
in
describing
the
various
arts
which
marked
the
nations
of
antiquity
we
can
not
but
feel
that
in
a
material
point
of
view
the
ancient
civilization
in
its
important
features
was
as
splendid
as
our
own
in
the
decoration
of
houses
in
social
entertainments
in

the
romans
were
our
equals
the
mosaics
the
signet

bronzes

colored

all
attest
great
elegance
and

the

as
expensive
as

carved
in

exquisitely
as

mirrors
were
made
of

imitate
the
colors
of
precious

so
well
that
the
portland
vase
from
the
tomb
of
alexander
severus
was
long
considered
as
a

sardonyx
the

was

celebrated
for

the

cast

but
the
glory
of

was
in

which
visited
all
the

and
even
penetrated
to

but
greater
than
tyre
or

or

was
alexandria
the
capital
of

egypt
even
in
its
decline
was
still
a
great
monarchy
and
when

the

is
said
to
have
amounted

the
annual
revenues
of

amounted
to
about
seventeen
million

besides
the

a

cost
philadelphus
more
than
half
a

sterling
and
he
had
accumulated
treasures
to
the
amount
of
seven
hundred
and
forty
thousand
talents
or
about
eight
hundred
and
sixty
million
dollars
what
european
monarch
ever
possessed
such
a
sum
the
kings
of
egypt
even
when
tributary
to
rome
were
richer
in
gold
and
silver
than
was
louis
xiv
in
the
proudest
hour
of
his
life
the
of
alexandria
was
traced
by
alexander
himself
but
it
was
not
completed
until
the
reign
of
ptolemy
philadelphus
its
circumference
was
about
fifteen
miles
the
streets
were
regular
and
crossed
one
another
at
right
angles
being
wide
enough
for
free
passage
of
both
carriages
and
foot
passengers
its
harbor
could
hold
the
largest
fleet
ever
congregated
its
walls
and
gates
were
constructed
with
all
the
skill
and
strength
known
to
antiquity
its
population
numbered
six
hundred
thousand
and
all
nations
were
represented
in
its
crowded
streets
the
wealth
of
the
city
may
be
inferred
from
the
fact
that
in
one
year
hundred
and
fifty
talents
or
more
than
six
million
dollars
were
paid
to
the
public
treasury
for
port
dues
the
library
was
the
largest
in
the
world
numbering
over
seven
hundred
thousand
volumes
and
this
was
connected
with
a
museum
a
menagerie
a
botanical
garden
and
various
halls
for
lectures
altogether
forming
the
most
famous
university
in
the
roman
empire
the
inhabitants
were
chiefly
greek
and
had
all
the
cultivated
tastes
and
mercantile
thrift
of
that
people
in
a
commercial
point
of
view
alexandria
was
the
most
important
city
in
the
world
and
its
ships
whitened
every
sea
unlike
most
commercial
cities
it
was
intellectual
and
its
schools
of
poetry
mathematics
medicine
philosophy
and
theology
were
more
renowned
than
even
those
of
athens
during
the
third
and
fourth
centuries
alexandria
could
it
have
been
transported
in
its
former
splendor
to
our
modern
world
would
be
a
great
capital
in
these
times
and
all
these
cities
were
connected
with
one
another
and
with
rome
by
magnificent
roads
perfectly
straight
and
paved
with
large
blocks
of
stone
they
were
originally
constructed
for

still

thus

of
one

sailed

the

with
the

which
flowed
into
it
was
the

highway
of
the
ancient
navigator
navigation
by
the
ancients
was
even
more
rapid
than
in
modern
times
before
the
invention
of
steam
since
oars
were
employed
as
well
as
sails
in
summer
one
hundred
and
roman
miles
were
sailed
over
in
hours
this
was
the
average
speed
or
about
seven
knots
from
the

of
the

vessels
could
usually
reach
africa
in
two
days
massilia
in

and
the

of

in

from
puteoli
the
passage
to
alexandria
had
been
effected
with
moderate
winds
in
nine
days
these
facts
however
apply
only
to
the
summer
and
to
favorable
winds
the
romans
did
not
navigate
in
the
inclement
seasons
but
in
summer
the
great
inland
sea
was
white
with
sails
great
fleets
brought
corn
from
gaul
spain
sardinia
africa
sicily
and
egypt
this
was
the
most
important
trade
but
a
considerable
commerce
was
carried
on
also
in
ivory
cotton
and
silk
fabrics
pearls
and
precious
stones
gums
spices
wines
wool
and
oil
greek
and
asiatic
wines
especially
the

for
the

of

and
of

required
very
large
fleets
and
thousands
of
mariners
which
probably
belonged
chiefly
to
great

these

with
their
dependencies
required
even
more

for

with
one
another
than
for
rome
herself
the
great
central
object
of
enterprise
and
cupidity
in
this
survey
of
ancient
cities
i
have
not
yet
spoken
of
the
great
central
city
the
city
of
the

hills
to
which
all
the
world
was
tributary
whatever
was
costly
or
rare
or
beautiful
in
greece
or
asia
or
egypt
was
appropriated
by
her
citizen
kings
since
citizens
were
provincial
governors
all
the
great
highways
from
the
atlantic
to
the

converged
to
the
capital
all
roads
led
to

all
the

of
alexandria
and
carthage
and
tarentum
and
other

were
employed
in

her
with
luxuries
or

never
was
there
so
proud
a
city
as
this
epitome
of
the
universe
london
paris
vienna
constantinople
petersburg
berlin
are
great
centres
of
fashion
and
power
but
they
are
rivals
and
excel
only
in
some
great
department
of
human
enterprise
and
genius
as
in
letters
or
fashions
or
commerce
or
manufactures
centres
of
influence
and
power
in
the
countries
of
which
they
are
capitals
yet
they
do
not
monopolize
the
wealth
and
energies
of
the
world
london
may
contain
more
people
than
did
ancient
rome
and
may
possess
more
commercial
wealth
but
london
represents
only
the
british
monarchy
not
a
universal
empire
rome
however
monopolized
every
thing
and
controlled
all
nations
and
peoples
she
could
shut
up
the
schools
of
athens
or
disperse
the

of
alexandria
or
regulate
the
shops
of

what
lyons

are

corinth
and
babylon
were
to

him
the

their

as

enriched
with

great
were

but
how
was
rome
since
all
were
subordinate
to
her
how
bewildering
and
bewitching
to
a
traveller
must
have
been
the
varied
wonders
of
the
city
go
where
he
would
his
eye
rested
on
something
which
was
both
a
study
and
a
marvel
let
him
drive
or
walk
about
the
suburbs
there
were
villas
tombs
aqueducts
looking
like
our
railroads
on
arches
sculptured
monuments
and
gardens
of
surpassing
beauty
and
luxury
let
him
approach
the
walls
they
were
great
fortifications
extending
miles
in
circuit
according
to
the
measurement
of
ammon
as
adopted
by
gibbon
and
miles
according
to
other
authorities
let
him
enter
any
of
the
various
gates
that
opened
into
the
city
from
the
roads
which
radiated
to
all
parts
of
italy
and
the
world
they
were
of
monumental
brass
covered
with
on
which
the
victories
of
generals
for
a
thousand
years
were
commemorated
let
him
pass
through
any
of
the
crowded
thoroughfares
he
saw
houses
towering
scarcely
ever
less
than
seventy
feet
as
tall
as
those
of
edinburgh
in
its
oldest
sections
most
of
the
houses
in
which
this
vast
population
lived
according
to
strabo
possessed
pipes
which
gave
a
supply
of
water
from
the
rivers
that
flowed
into
the
city
through
the
aqueducts
and
out
again
through
the
sewers
into
the
tiber
let
the
traveller
walk
up
the
via
sacra
that
short
street
scarcely
half
a
mile
in
length
and
he
passed
the
flavian
amphitheatre
the
temple
of

and
rome
the
arch
of

the
temples
of
peace
of
vesta

and
stood
before
the
majestic
ascent
to
the
capitoline
jupiter
with
its
magnificent
portico
and
ornamented
pediment
surpassing
the
façade
of
any
modern
church
on
his
left
as
he
emerged
from
beneath
the
sculptured
arch
of
titus
was
the
palatine
mount
nearly
covered
by
the
palace
of
the
caesars
the
magnificent
residences
of
the
higher
nobility
and
various
temples
of
which
that
of
apollo
was
the
most
magnificent
built
by
augustus
of
solid
white
marble
from

here
were
the

on
his

in
the

between
the

though
he
could
not
see
it
concealed
from
view
by
the
great
temples
of
vesta
and
of
castor
and
the
still
greater
edifice
known
as
the
basilica
julia
was
the
quarter
called
the
velabrum
extending
to
the
river
where
the
pons
aemilius
crossed
it
a
low
quarter
of
narrow
streets
and
tall
houses
where
the
rabble
lived
and
died
on
his
right
concealed
from
view
by
the
aedes
divi
julii
and
the
forum
romanum
was
that
magnificent
series
of
edifices
extending

more
than
three
thousand
feet
in
length
and
six
hundred
in
breadth
almost
entirely
surrounded
by
porticos
and
colonnades
and
filled
with
statues
and
pictures
displaying
on
the
whole
probably
the
grandest
series
of
public
buildings
clustered
together
ever
erected
especially
if
we
include
the
forum
romanum
and
the
various
temples
and
basilicas
which
connected
the
whole
a
forest
of
marble
pillars
and
statues
ascending
the
steps
which
led
from
the
temple
of
concord
to
the
temple
of
juno
moneta
upon
the
arx
or
tarpeian
rock
on
the
southwestern
summit
of
the
hill
itself
one
of
the
most
beautiful
temples
in
rome
erected
by
camillus
on
the
spot
where
the
house
of
manlius
capitolinus
had
stood
and
one
came
upon
the
roman
mint
near
this
was
the
temple
erected
by
augustus
to
jupiter
tonans
and
that
built
by
domitian
to
jupiter
custos
but
all
the
sacred
edifices
which
crowned
the
capitoline
were
subordinate
to
the
templum
jovis
capitolini
standing
on
a
platform
of
eight
thousand
square
feet
and
built
of
the
richest
materials
the
portico
which
faced
the
via
sacra
consisted
of
three
rows
of
doric
columns
the
pediment
profusely
ornamented
with
the
choicest
sculptures
the
apex
of
the
roof
surmounted
by
the
bronze
horses
of
lysippus
and
the
roof
itself
covered
with
gilded
tiles
the
temple
had
three
separate
cells
though
covered
with
one
roof
in
front
of
each
stood
colossal
statues
of
the
three
deities
to
whom
it
was
consecrated
here
were
preserved
what
was
most
sacred
in
the
eyes
of
romans
and
it
was
itself
the
richest
of
all
the
temples
of
the
city
what
a
beautiful
panorama
was
presented
to
the
view
from
the
summit
of
this
consecrated
hill
only
mounted
by
a
steep
ascent
of
one
hundred

was
the

as
the

could
reach
a
little
beyond
the
fora
to
the
east
was
the
carinae
a
fashionable
quarter
of
beautiful
shops

houses
and
still
farther
off
were
the
baths
of
titus
extending
from
the
carinae
to
the
esquiline
mount
to
the
northeast
were
the
viminal
and
quirinal
hills
after
the
palatine
the
most
ancient
part
of
the
city
the
seat
of
the
sabine
population
abounding
in
fanes
and
temples
the
most
splendid
of
which
was
the
temple
of
quirinus
erected
originally
to
romulus
by
numa
but
rebuilt
by
augustus
with
a
double
row
of
columns
on
each
of
its
sides
in
number
near
by
was
the
house
of
atticus
and
the
gardens
of
sallust
in
the
valley
between
the
quirinal
and
pincian
afterward
the
property
of
the
emperor
far
back
on
the
quirinal
near
the
wall
of
servius
were
the
baths
of
diocletian
and
still
farther
to
the
east
the
pretorian
camp
established
by
tiberius
and
included
within
the
wall
of
aurelian

the
northeast
the

lighted
on
the
pincian
hill
covered
with
the
gardens
of
lucullus
to
possess
which
messalina
caused
the
death
of
valerius
asiaticus
into
whose
possession
they
had
fallen
in
the
valley
which
lay
between
the
fora
and
the
quirinal
was
the
celebrated
subura
the
quarter
of
shops
markets
and
artificers
a
busy
noisy
vulgar
section
not
beautiful
but
full
of
life
and
enterprise
and
wickedness
the
eye
then
turned
to
the
north
and
the
whole
length
of
the
via
flamina
was
exposed
to
view
extending
from
the
capitoline
to
the
flaminian
gate
perfectly
straight
the
finest

to
the

was
the

aurelius
and
the

was
the
circus
flaminius
the
portico
of
octavius
the
theatre
of

and
the
theatre
of
pompey
where
forty
thousand
spectators
were
accommodated
stretching
beyond
the
thermae
alexandrinae
near
the
pantheon
was
the
magnificent
bridge
which
crossed
the
tiber
built
by
hadrian
when
he
founded
his
mausoleum
to
which
it
led
still
standing
under
the
name
of
the
ponte
angelo
the

took
in
eight
or
nine
bridges
over
the
tiber

of
wood
but
generally
of
stone
of
beautiful
masonry
and
crowned
with
statues

between
the
palatine
and
the
aventine
was
the

maximus
founded
by
the
early

it
was
the
largest
open
space
inclosed
by
walls
and
porticos
in
the
city
it
seated
three
hundred
and
thousand
spectators
how
vast
a
city
which
could
spare
nearly
four
hundred
thousand
of
its
population
to
see
the
beyond
was
the
aventine
itself
this
also
was
rich
in
legendary
monuments
and
in
the

jerome
beneath
the

a
little

of
the

maximus
were
the
great
baths
of
caracalla
the
ruins
of
which
next
to
those
of
the
colosseum
made
on
my
mind
the
strongest
impression
of
all
i
saw
that
pertains
to
antiquity
though
these
were
not
so
large
as
those
of
diocletian
the
view
south
took
in
the
caelian
hill
the
ancient
residence
of
tullus
hostilius
this
hill
was
the
residence
of
many
distinguished
romans
among
whose
palaces
was
that
of
claudius
centumalus
which
towered
ten
or
twelve
stories
into
the
air
but
grander
than
any
of
these
palaces
was
that
of
plautius
lateranus
on
whose
site
now
stands
the
basilica
of
john

of
constantine

rome
one
of
the
most
ancient
of
the
christian
churches
in
which
for
fifteen
hundred
years
daily
services
have
been
performed
such
were
the
objects
of
interest
and
grandeur
that
met
the
eye
as
it
was
turned
toward
the
various
quarters
of
the
city
which
contained
between
three
and
four
millions
of
people
lipsius
estimates
four
millions
as
the
population
including
slaves
women
children
and
strangers
though
this
estimate
is
regarded
as
too
large
by
merivale
and
others
yet
how
enormous
must
have
been
the
number
of
the
people
when
there
were
nine
thousand
and
baths
and
when
those
of
diocletian
could
accommodate
hundred
bathers
at
a
time
the
wooden
theatre
of
scaurus
contained
eighty
thousand
seats
that
of
marcellus
twenty
thousand
the
colosseum
would
seat
thousand
persons
and
give
standing
space
for
thousand
more
the
circus
maximus
would
hold
three
hundred
and
thousand
spectators
if
only
one
person
out
of
four
of
the
free
population
witnessed
the
games
and
spectacles
at
a
time
we
thus
must
have
four
millions
of
people
altogether
in
the
city
the
aurelian
walls
are
now
only
thirteen
miles
in
circumference
but
lipsius
estimates
the
original
circumference
at
miles
and
vopiscus
at
nearly
fifty
the
diameter
of
the
city
must
have
been
eleven
miles
since
strabo
tells
us
that
the
actual
limit
of
rome
was
at
a
place
between
the
fifth
and
sixth
milestone
from
the
column
of
trajan
in
the
forum
the
central
and
most
conspicuous
object
in
the
city
except
the
capitol
modern
writers
taking
london
and
paris
for
their
measure
of
material
civilization
seem
unwilling
to
admit
that
rome
could
have
reached
such
a
pitch
of
glory
and
wealth
and
power
to
him
who
stands
within
the
narrow
limits
of
the
forum
as
it
now
appears
it
seems
incredible
that
it
could
have
been
the
centre
of
a
much
larger
city
than
europe
can
now
boast
of
grave
historians
are
loath
to
compromise
their
dignity
and
character
for
truth
by
admitting
statements
which
seem
to
men
of
limited
views
to
be
fabulous
and
which
transcend
modern
experience
but
we
should
remember
that
most
of
the
monuments
of
ancient
rome
have
entirely
disappeared
nothing
remains
of
the
palace
of
the
caesars
which
nearly
covered
the
palatine
hill
little
of
the
fora
which
connected
together
covered
a
space
twice
as
large
as
that
inclosed
by
the
palaces
of
the
louvre
and
tuileries
with
all
their
galleries
and
courts
almost
nothing
of
the
glories
of
the
capitoline
hill
and
little
comparatively
of
those
thermae
which
were
a
mile
in
circuit
but
what
does
remain
attests
an
unparalleled
grandeur
the
broken
pillars
of
the
forum
the
lofty
columns
of
trajan
and
marcus
aurelius
the
pantheon
lifting
its
spacious
dome
two
hundred
feet
into
the
air
the
mere
vestibule
of
the
baths
of
agrippa
the
triumphal
arches
of
titus
and
trajan
and
constantine
the
bridges
which
span
the
tiber
the
aqueducts
which
cross
the
campagna
the
cloaca
maxima
which
drained
the
marshes
and
lakes
of
the
infant
city
and
above
all
the
colosseum
what
glory
and
shame
are
associated
with
that
single
edifice
that
alone
if
nothing
else
remained
of
pagan
antiquity
would
indicate
a
grandeur
and
a
folly
such
as
can
not
now
be
seen
on
earth
it
reveals
a
wonderful
skill
in
masonry
and
great
architectural
strength
it
shows
the
wealth
and
resources
of
rulers
who
must
have
had
the
treasures
of
the
world
at
their
command
it
shows
the
restless
passions
of
the
people
for
excitement
and
the
necessity
on
the
part
of
government
of
yielding
to
this
taste
what
leisure
and
indolence
marked
a
city
which
could
afford
to
give
up
so
much
time
to
the
demoralizing
sports
what
facilities
for
transportation
were
afforded
when
so
many
wild
beasts
could
be
brought
to
the
capitol
from
the
central
parts
of
africa
without
calling
out
unusual
comment
how
imperious
a
populace
that
compels
the
government
to
provide
such
expensive
pleasures
the
games
of
titus
on
the
dedication
of
the
colosseum
lasted
one
hundred
days
and
five
thousand
wild
beasts
were
slaughtered
in
the
arena
the
number
of
the
gladiators
who
fought
surpasses
belief
at
the
triumph
of
trajan
over
the
dacians
ten
thousand
gladiators
were
exhibited
and
the
emperor
himself
presided
under
a
gilded
canopy
surrounded
by
thousands
of
his
lords
underneath
the
arena
strewed
with
yellow
sand
and
sawdust
was
a
solid
pavement
so
closely
cemented
that
it
could
be
turned
into
an
artificial
lake
on
which
naval
battles
were
fought
but
it
was
the
conflict
of
gladiators
which
most
deeply
stimulated
the
passions
of
the
people
the
benches
were
crowded
with
eager
spectators
and
the
voices
of
one
hundred
thousand
were
raised
in
triumph
or
rage
as
the
miserable
victims
sank
exhausted
in
the
bloody
sport
yet
it
was
not
the
gladiatorial
sports
of
the
amphitheatre
which
most
strikingly
attested
the
greatness
and
splendor
of
the
city
nor
the
palaces
in
which
as
many
as
four
hundred
slaves
were
sometimes
maintained
as
domestic
servants
for
a
single
establishment
twelve
hundred
in
number
according
to
the
lowest
estimate
but
probably
five
times
as
numerous
since
every
senator
every
knight
and
every
rich
man
was
proud
to
possess
a
residence
which
would
attract
attention
nor
the
temples
which
numbered
four
hundred
and
most
of
which
were
of
marble
filled
with
statues
the
contributions
of
ages
and
surrounded
with
groves
nor
the
fora
and
basilicas
with
their
porticos
statues
and
pictures
covering
more
space
than
any
cluster
of
public
buildings
in
europe
a
mile
and
a
half
in
circuit
nor
the
baths
nearly
as
large
still
more
completely
filled
with
works
of
art
nor
the
circus
maximus
where
more
people
witnessed
the
chariot
races
at
a
time
than
are
nightly
assembled
in
all
the
places
of
public
amusement
in
paris
london
and
new
york
combined
more
than
could
be
seated
in
all
the
cathedrals
of
england
and
france
it
is
not
these
which
most
impressively
make
us
feel
the
amazing
grandeur
of
the
old
capital
of
the
world
the
triumphal
processions
of
the
conquering
generals
were
still
more
exciting
to
behold
for
these
appealed
more
directly
to
the
imagination
and
excited
those
passions
which
urged
the
romans
to
a
career
of
conquest
from
generation
to
generation
no
military
review
of
modern
times
equalled
those
gorgeous
triumphs
even
as
no
scenic
performance
compares
with
the
gladiatorial
shows
the
sun
has
never
shone
upon
any
human
assemblage
so
magnificent
and
so
grand
so
imposing
and
yet
so
guilty
not
only
were
displayed
the
spoils
of
conquered
kingdoms
and
the
triumphal
cars
of
generals
but
the
whole
military
strength
of
the
capital
an
army
of
one
hundred
thousand
men
flushed
with
victory
followed
the
gorgeous
procession
of
nobles
and
princes
the
triumph
of
aurelian
on
his
return
from
the
east
gives
us
some
idea
of
the
grandeur
of
that
ovation
to
conquerors
the
pomp
was
opened
by
twenty
elephants
four
royal
tigers
and
two
hundred
of
the
most
curious
animals
from
every
climate
north
south
east
and
west
these
were
followed
by
sixteen
hundred
gladiators
devoted
to
the
cruel
amusement
of
the
amphitheatre
then
were
displayed
the
arms
and
ensigns
of
conquered
nations
the
plate
and
wardrobe
of
the
syrian
queen
then
ambassadors
from
all
parts
of
the
earth
all
remarkable
in
their
rich
dresses
with
their
crowns
and
offerings
then
the
captives
taken
in
the
various
wars
goths
vandals
samaritans
alemanni
franks
gauls
syrians
and
egyptians
each
marked
by
their
national
costume
then
the
queen
of
the
east
the
beautiful
zenobia
confined
by
fetters
of
gold
and
fainting
under
the
weight
of
jewels
preceding
the
beautiful
chariot
in
which
she
had
hoped
to
enter
the
gates
of
rome
then
the
chariot
of
the
persian
king
then
the
triumphal
car
of
aurelian
himself
drawn
by
elephants
finally
the
most
illustrious
of
the
senate
and
the
army
closed
the
solemn
procession
amid
the
acclamations
of
the
people
and
the
sound
of
musical
instruments
it
took
from
dawn
of
day
until
the
ninth
hour
for
the
procession
to
pass
to
the
capitol
and
the
festival
was
protracted
by
theatrical
representations
the
games
of
the
circus
the
hunting
of
wild
beasts
combats
of
gladiators
and
naval
engagements
such
were
the
material
wonders
of
the
ancient
civilizations
culminating
in
their
latest
and
greatest
representative
and
displayed
in
its
proud
capital
nearly
all
of
which
became
later
the
spoil
of
barbarians
who
ruthlessly
marched
over
the
classic
world
having
no
regard
for
its
choicest
treasures
those
old
glories
are
now
indeed
succeeded
by
a
prouder
civilization
the
work
of
nobler
races
after
sixteen
hundred
years
of
new
experiments
but
why
such
an
eclipse
of
the
glory
of
man
the
reason
is
apparent
if
we
survey

of

notwithstanding

the

in

of

nothing
impresses
us
more
forcibly
than
the
perpetual
wars
in
which
they
were
engaged
and
the
fact
that
military
art
and
science
seem
to
have
been
among
the
earliest
things
that
occupied
the
thoughts
of
men
personal
strife
and

are
coeval
with

after
the
expulsion
of

from

read
of
contentions
between
the
servants
of
abraham
and
of
lot
and
between
the
petty
kings
and
chieftains
of
the
countries
where
they
journeyed
long
before
abraham
was
born
violence
was
the
greatest
evil
with
which
the
world
was
afflicted
before
his
day
mighty
conquerors
arose
and
founded

babylon
and
egypt
were
powerful
military
states
in
times
wars
more
or
less
fierce
were
waged
before
nations
were
civilized
the
earliest
known
art
therefore
was
the
art
of
destruction
growing
out
of
the
wicked
and
brutal
passions
of

envy
and
hatred
ambition
and
revenge
in

selfishness
race
fought
with

kingdom
with

with

in
the
very
infancy
of
society
in
secular
history
the
greatest
names
are
those
of
conquerors
and
heroes
in
every
land
under
the
sun
and
it
was
by
conquerors
that
those
grand
monuments
were
erected
the
ruins
of
which
astonish
every
traveller
especially
in
egypt
and
assyria
but
wars
in
the
earliest
ages
were
not
carried
on
scientifically
or
even
as
an
art
there
was
little
to
mark
them
except
brute
force
armies
were
scarcely
more
than
great
collections
of
armed
men
led
by
kings
either
to
protect
their
states
from
hostile
invaders
or
to
acquire
new
territory
or
to
exact
tribute
from
weaker
nations
we
do
not
read
of
military
discipline
or
of
skill
in
strategy
and
tactics
a
battle
was
lost
or
won
by
individual
prowess
it
was
generally
a
encounter
in
which
the
strongest
and
bravest
gained
the
victory
one
of
the
earliest
descriptions
of
war
is
to
be
found
in
the
iliad
of
homer
where
individual
heroes
fought
with
one
another
armed
with
the
sword
the
lance
and
the
javelin
protected
by
shields
helmets
and
coats
of
mail
they
fought
on
foot
or
from
chariots
which
were
in
use
before
cavalry
the
was
driven
before
he
was
ridden
in
egypt
or
palestine
but
the
aryan
barbarians
in
their
invasion
rode
their
horses
and
fought
on
horseback
like
the
modern
cossacks
until
the
greeks
became
familiar
with
war
as
an
art
armies
were
usually
very
large
as
if
a
great
part
of
the
population
of
a
country
followed
the
sovereign
who
commanded
them
rameses
the
great
the
sesostris
of
the
greeks
according
to
herodotus
led
nearly
a
million
of
men
in
his
expeditions
he
was
the
most
noted
of
ancient
warriors
until
cyrus
the
persian
arose
and
was
nearly
contemporaneous
with
moses
the
trojan
war
is
supposed
to
have
taken
place
during
the
period
when
the
israelites
were
subject
to
the
ammonites
and
about
the
time
that
the
philistines
were
defeated
by
david
the
greeks
were
forced
by
war
to
found
colonies
in
asia
minor
after
authentic
history
begins
war
is
the
main
subject
with
which
it
has
to
deal
and
for
three
thousand
years
history
is
simply
the
record
of
the
feats
of
warriors
and
generals
of
their
conquests
and
defeats
of
the
rise
and
fall
of
kingdoms
and
cities
of
the
growth
or
decline
of
military
virtues
no
arts
of
civilization
have
preserved
nations
from
the
sword
of
the
conqueror
and
war
has
been
both
the
amusement
and
the
business
of
kings
from
the
earliest
ages
the
most
valued
laurels
have
been
bestowed
for
success
in
war
and
military
fame
has
eclipsed
all
other
glories
the
cry
of
the
mourner
has
been
unheeded
in
the
blaze
of
conquest
even
the
aspirations
of
the
poet
and
the
labors
of
the
artist
have
been
as
nought
except
to
celebrate
the
achievements
of
heroes
it
is
interesting
then
to
inquire
how
far
the
ancients
advanced
in
the
arts
of
war
which
include
military
weapons
movements
the
structure
of
camps
the
discipline
of
armies
the
construction
of
ships
and
of
military
engines
and
the
concentration
and
management
of
forces
under
a
single
man
what
was
that
mighty
machinery
by
which
nations
were
subdued
or
rose
to
greatness
on
the
ruin
of
states
and
empires
the
conquests
of
rameses
of
david
of
nebuchadnezzar
of
cyrus
of
alexander
of
hannibal
of
caesar
and
other
heroes
are
still
the
subjects
of
contemplation
among
statesmen
and
schoolboys
the
exploits
of
heroes
are
the
pith
of
history
the
art
of
war
must
have
made
great
progress
in
the
infancy
of
civilization
when
bodily
energies
were
most
highly
valued
when
men
were
fierce
hardy
strong
and
uncorrupted
by
luxury
when
mere
physical
forces
gave
law
alike
to
the
rich
and
the
poor
to
the
learned
and
the
ignorant
and
when
the
avenue
to
power
led
across
the
field
of
battle
we
must
go
to
egypt
for
the
earliest
development
of
art
and
science
in
all
departments
and
so
far
as
the
art
of
war
consists
in
the
organization
of
physical
forces
for
conquest
or
defence
under
the
direction
of
a
single
man
it
was
in
egypt
that
this
was
first
accomplished
about
seventeen
hundred
years
before
christ
as
chronologists
think
by
rameses
the
great
this
monarch
according
to
wilkinson
the
greatest
and
most
ambitious
of
the
egyptian
kings
to
whom
the
greeks
gave
the
name
of
sesostris
showed
great
ability
in
collecting
together
large
bodies
of
his
subjects
and
controlling
them
by
a
rigid
military
discipline
he
accustomed
them
to
heat
and
cold
hunger
and
thirst
fatigue
and
exposure
to
danger
with
bodies
thus
rendered
vigorous
by
labor
and
discipline
they
were
fitted
for
distant
expeditions
rameses
first
subdued
the
arabians
and
libyans
and
annexed
them
to
the
egyptian
monarchy
while
he
inured
his
subjects
to
fatigue
and
danger
he
was
careful
to
win
their
affections
by
acts
of
munificence
and
clemency
he
then
made
his
preparations
for
the
conquest
of
the
known
world
and
collected
an
army
according
to
diodorus
siculus
of
six
hundred
thousand
infantry
thousand
cavalry
and
thousand
it
is
difficult
to
understand
how
a
small
country
like
egypt
could
furnish
such
an
immense
force
if
the
account
of
the
historian
be
not
exaggerated
rameses
must
have
enrolled
the
conquered
libyans
and
arabians
and
other
nations
among
his
soldiers
he
subjected
his
army
to
a
stern
discipline
and
an
uncomplaining
obedience
to
orders
the
first
principle
in
the
science
of
war
which
no
successful
general
in
the
world
history
has
ever
disregarded
from
alexander
to
napoleon
with
this
powerful
army
his
march
was
irresistible
ethiopia
was
first
subdued
and
an
exaction
made
from
the
conquered
of
a
tribute
of
gold
ivory
and
ebony
in
those
ancient
times
a
conquering
army
did
not
resettle
or
colonize
the
territories
it
had
subdued
but
was
contented
with
overrunning
the
country
and
exacting
tribute
from
the
people
such
was
the
nature
of
the
babylonian
and
persian
conquests
after
overrunning
ethiopia
and
some
other
countries
near
the
straits
of
babelmandeb
the
conqueror
proceeded
to
india
which
he
overran
beyond
the
ganges
and
ascended
the
high
of
central
asia
then
proceeding
westward
he
entered
europe
nor
halted
in
his
devastating
career
until
he
reached
thrace
from
thence
he
marched
to
asia
minor
conquering
as
he
went
and
invaded
assyria
seating
himself
on
the
throne
of
ninus
and
semiramis
then
laden
with
booty
from
the
eastern
world
he
returned
to
egypt
after
an
absence
of
thirty
years
and
consolidated
his
empire
building
those
vast
structures
at
thebes
which
for
magnitude
have
never
been
surpassed
thus
was
egypt
enriched
with
the
spoil
of
nations
and
made
formidable
for
a
thousand
years
rameses
was
the
last
of
the
pharaohs
who
pursued
the
phantom
of
military
renown
or
sought
glory
in
distant
expeditions
we
are
in
ignorance
as
to
the
details
of
the
conquests
and
the
generals
who
served
under
rameses
there
is
doubtless
some
exaggeration
in
the
statements
of
the
greek
historian
but
there
is
no
doubt
that
this
monarch
was
among
the
first
of
the
great
conquerors
to
establish
a
regular
army
and
to
provide
a
fleet
to
with
his
land
forces
the
strength
of
the
egyptian
army
consisted
mainly
in
archers
they
fought
either
on
foot
or
in
chariots
cavalry
was
not
much
relied
upon
although
mention
is
frequently
made
of
horsemen
as
well
as
of
chariots
the
egyptian
infantry
was
divided
into
regiments
and
wilkinson
tells
us
that
they
were
named
according
to
the
arms
they
bore
as
bowmen
spearmen
swordsmen
clubmen
slingers
these
regiments
were
divided
into
battalions
and
companies
commanded
by
their
captains
the
infantry
heavily
armed
with
spears
and
shields
formed
a
phalanx
almost
impenetrable
of
twelve
men
deep
who
marched
with
great
regularity
each
company
had
its
who
was
an
officer
of
approved
valor
the
royal
standards
were
carried
by
the
royal
princes
or
by
persons
of
the
royal
household
the
troops
were
summoned
by
the
sound
of
trumpet
and
also
by
the
drum
both
used
from
the
earliest
period
the
offensive
weapons
were
the
bow
the
spear
the
javelin
the
sword
the
club
or
mace
and
the
the
chief
defensive
weapon
was
the
shield
about
three
feet
in
length
covered
with
bull
hide
having
the
hair
outward
and
studded
with
nails
the
shape
of
the
bow
was
not
essentially
different
from
that
used
in
europe
in
the
middle
ages
being
about
five
feet
and
a
half
long
round
and
tapering
at
the
ends
the
bowstring
was
of
hide
or
catgut
the
arrows
of
the
archers
averaged
about
thirty
inches
in
length
and
were
made
of
wood
or
reeds
tipped
with
a
metal
point
or
flint
and
winged
with
feathers
each
bowman
was
furnished
with
a
plentiful
supply
of
arrows
when
arrows
were
exhausted
the
bowman
fought
with
swords
and
his
defensive
armor
was
confined
chiefly
to
the
helmet
and
a
sort
of
quilted
coat
the
spear
was
of
wood
with
a
metal
head
was
about
five
or
six
feet
in
length
and
used
for
thrusting
the
javelin
was
lighter
for
throwing
the
sling
was
a
thong
of
plaited
leather
broad
in
the
middle
with
a
loop
at
the
end
the
sword
was
straight
and
short
between
two
and
three
feet
in
length
with
a
double
edge
tapering
to
a
sharp
point
and
used
for
either
cut
or
thrust
the
handle
was
frequently
inlaid
with
precious
stones
the
metal
used
in
the
manufacture
of
swords
and
was
bronze
hardened
by
a
process
unknown
to
us
the
had
a
handle
about
feet
in
length
and
was
less
ornamented
than
other
weapons
the
cuirass
or
coat
of
armor
was
made
of
horizontal
rows
of
metal
plate
about
an
inch
in
breadth
well
secured
together
by
bronze
pieces
the
egyptian
chariot
held
two
persons
the
charioteer
and
the
warrior
armed
with
his
and
wearing
a
cuirass
or
coat
of
mail
the
warrior
carried
also
other
weapons
for
close
encounter
when
he
should
descend
from
his
chariot
to
fight
on
foot
the
chariot
was
of
wood
the
body
of
which
was
light
strengthened
with
metal
the
pole
was
inserted
in
the
axle
the
two
wheels
usually
had
six
spokes
but
sometimes
only
four
the
wheel
revolved
on
the
axle
and
was
secured
by
a
the
leathern
harness
and
housings
were
simple
and
the
bridles
or
reins
were
nearly
the
same
as
are
now
in
use
the
egyptian
chariot
corps
like
the
infantry
says
wilkinson
were
divided
into
light
and
heavy
troops
both
armed
with
bows
the
former
chiefly
employed
in
harassing
the
enemy
with
missiles
the
latter
called
upon
to
break
through
opposing
masses
of
infantry
the
infantry
when
employed
in
the
assault
of
fortified
towns
were
provided
with
shields
under
cover
of
which
they
made
their
approaches
to
the
place
to
be
attacked
in
their
attack
they
advanced
under
cover
of
the
arrows
of
the
bowmen
and
instantly
applied
the
to
the
ramparts
the
testudo
a
wooden
shelter
was
also
used
large
enough
to
contain
several
men
the
and
movable
towers
resembled
those
of
the
romans
a
thousand
years
later
it
would
thus
appear
that
the
ancient
egyptians
in
the
discipline
of
armies
in
military
weapons
offensive
and
defensive
in
chariots
and
horses
and
in
military
engines
for
the
reduction
of
fortified
towns
were
scarcely
improved
upon
by
the
greeks
and
romans
or
by
the
europeans
in
the
middle
ages
yet
the
egyptians
were
an
ingenious
rather
than
a
warlike
people
fond
of
peace
and
devoted
to
agricultural
pursuits
more
warlike
than
they
were
the
assyrians
and
the
persians
although
we
fail
to
discover
any
essential
difference
in
the
organization
of
armies
or
in
military
weapons
the
great
difference
between
the
persian
and
the
egyptian
armies
was
in
the
use
of
cavalry
from
their
earliest
settlements
the
persians
were
skilful
horsemen
and
these
formed
the
guard
of
their
kings
under
cyrus
the
persians
became
the
masters
of
the
world
but
they
rapidly
degenerated
not
being
able
to
withstand
the
luxurious
life
of
the
conquered
babylonians
and
when
they
were
marshalled
against
the
greeks
and
especially
against
the
disciplined
forces
of
alexander
they
were
disgracefully
routed
in
spite
of
their
enormous
armies
which
could
not
be
handled
and
became
mere
mobs
of
armed
men
the
art
of
war
made
a
great
advance
under
the
greeks
although
we
do
not
notice
any
striking
superiority
of
arms
over
the
eastern
armies
led
by
sesostris
or
cyrus
the
greeks
were
among
the
most
warlike
of
all
the
races
of
men
they
had
a
genius
for
war
the
grecian
states
were
engaged
in
perpetual
strifes
with
one
another
and
constant
contention
developed
military
strength
and
yet
the
greeks
until
the
time
of
philip
had
no
standing
armies
they
relied
for
offence
and
defence
on
the
volunteer
militia
which
was
animated
by
intense
patriotic
ideas
all
armies
in
the
nature
of
things
are
more
or
less
machines
moved
by
one
commanding
will
but
the
greek
armies
owed
much
of
their
success
to
the
individual
bravery
of
their
troops
who
were
citizens
of
states
under
constitutional
forms
of
government
the
most
remarkable
improvement
in
the
art
of
war
was
made
by
the
spartans
who
in
addition
to
their
strict
military
discipline
introduced
the
files
of
picked
soldiers
eight
deep
heavily
armed
with
spear
sword
and
shield
placed
in
ranks
of
eight
at
intervals
of
about
six
feet
apart
this
phalanx
of
eight
files
and
eight
ranks
men
closely
locked
when
the
soldiers
received
or
advanced
to
attack
proved
nearly
impregnable
and
irresistible
it
combined
solidity
and
the
power
of
resistance
with
mobility
the
picked
men
were
placed
in
the
front
and
rear
for
in
skilful
evolutions
the
front
often
became
the
rear
and
the
rear
became
the
front
armed
with
spears
projecting
beyond
the
front
and
with
their
shields
locked
together
the
phalanx
advanced
to
meet
the
enemy
with
regular
step
and
to
the
cadence
of
music
if
beaten
it
retired
in
perfect
order
after
battle
each
soldier
was
obliged
to
produce
his
shield
as
a
proof
that
he
had
fought
or
retired
as
a
soldier
should
the
athenian
phalanx
was
less
solid
than
that
of
sparta
miltiades
having
decreased
the
depth
to
four
ranks
in
order
to
lengthen
his
front
but
was
more
efficient
in
a
charge
against
the
enemy
the
spartan
phalanx
was
stronger
in
defence
the
athenian
more
agile
in
attack
the
attack
was
nearly
irresistible
as
the
soldiers
advanced
with
accelerated
motion
corresponding
to
the
time
of
modern
warfare
this
was
first
introduced
by
miltiades
at
marathon
philip
of
macedon
adopted
the
spartan
phalanx
but
made
it
sixteen
deep
which
gave
it
greater
solidity
and
rendered
it
still
more
effective
he
introduced
the
large
oval
buckler
and
a
larger
and
heavier
spear
when
the
phalanx
was
closed
for
action
each
man
occupied
but
three
square
feet
of
ground
as
the
pikes
were
feet
in
length
and
projected
eighteen
feet
beyond
the
front
the
formation
presented
an
array
of
points
such
as
had
never
been
seen
before
the
greatest
improvement
effected
by
philip
however
was
the
adoption
of
standing
armies
instead
of
the
militia
heretofore
in
use
throughout
the
grecian
states
he
also
attached
great
importance
to
his
cavalry
which
was
composed
of
the
flower
of
the
nobility
about
twelve
hundred
in
number
all
covered
with
defensive
armor
these
he
formed
into
eight
squadrons
and
constituted
them
his
the
usual
formation
of
the
regular
cavalry
was
in
the
form
of
a
wedge
so
as
to
penetrate
and
break
the
enemy
line
a
manoeuvre
probably
learned
from
epaminondas
of
thebes
a
great
master
in
the
art
of
war
who
defeated
the
spartan
phalanx
by
forming
his
columns
upon
a
front
less
than
their
depth
thus
enabling
him
to
direct
his
whole
force
against
a
given
point
by
these
tactics
he
gained
the
great
victory
at
leuctra
as
napoleon
likewise
prevailed
over
the
austrians
in
his
italian
campaign
in
like
manner
philip
son
alexander
following
the
example
of
epaminondas
concentrated
his
forces
upon
the
enemy
centre
and
easily
defeated
the
persian
hosts
by
creating
a
panic
there
was
no
resisting
a
phalanx
sixteen
files
deep
with
their
projecting
pikes
aided
by
the
heavily
armed
cavalry
all
under
the
strictest
military
discipline
and
animated
by
patriotic
ardor
this
terrible
macedonian
phalanx
was
a
great
advance
over
the
early
armies
of
the
greeks
who
fought
without
discipline
in
a
hand
to
hand
encounter
with
swords
and
spears
after
exhausting
their
arrows
they
had
learned
two
things
of
great
importance
a
rigid
discipline
and
a
concentration
of
forces
which
made
an
army
a
machine
under
alexander
the
grand
phalanx
consisted
of
men
made
up
of
four
divisions
and
smaller
phalanxes
in
roman
armies
we
see
a
still
further
advance
in
the
military
art
as
it
existed
in
the
time
of
augustus
which
required
centuries
to
perfect
the
hardy
physique
and
stern
nature
of
the
romans
exercised
and
controlled
by
their
organizing
genius
evolved
the
roman
legion
which
learned
to
resist
the
impetuous
assaults
of
the
elephants
of
the
east
the
phalanx
of
the
greeks
and
the
teutonic
barbarians
the
indomitable
courage
of
the
romans
trained
under
severest
discipline
and
directed
by
means
of
an
organization
divided
and
subdivided
and
officered
almost
as
perfectly
as
our
modern
corps
and
divisions
and
brigades
and
regiments
and
companies
and
squads
marched
over
and
subdued
the
world
the
roman
soldier
was
trained
to
march
twenty
miles
a
day
under
a
burden
of
eighty
pounds
to
swim
rivers
to
climb
mountains
to
penetrate
forests
and
to
encounter
every
kind
of
danger
he
was
taught
that
his
destiny
was
to
die
in
battle
death
was
at
once
his
duty
and
his
glory
he
enlisted
in
the
army
with
little
hope
of
revisiting
his
home
he
crossed
seas
and
deserts
and
forests
with
the
idea
of
spending
his
life
in
the
service
of
his
country
his
pay
was
only
a
denarius
daily
equal
to
about
sixteen
cents
of
our
money
marriage
for
him
was
discouraged
or
forbidden
however
insignificant
the
legionary
was
as
a
man
he
gained
importance
from
the
great
body
with
which
he
was
identified
he
was
both
the
servant
and
the
master
of
the
state
he
had
an
intense
de
he
was
bound
up
in
the
glory
of
his
legion
both
religion
and
honor
bound
him
to
his
standards
the
golden
eagle
which
glittered
in
his
front
was
the
object
of
his
fondest
devotion
nor
was
it
possible
to
escape
the
penalty
of
cowardice
or
treachery
or
disobedience
he
could
be
chastised
with
blows
by
his
centurion
and
his
general
could
doom
him
to
death
never
was
the
severity
of
military
discipline
relaxed
military
exercises
were
incessant
in
winter
as
in
summer
in
the
midst
of
peace
the
roman
troops
were
familiarized
with
the
practice
of
war
it
was
the
spirit
which
animated
the
roman
legions
and
the
discipline
to
which
they
were
inured
that
gave
them
their
irresistible
strength
when
we
remember
that
they
had
not
our
firearms
we
can
but
be
surprised
at
their
efficiency
especially
in
taking
strongly
fortified
cities
jerusalem
was
defended
by
a
triple
wall
the
most
elaborate
fortifications
and
thousand
soldiers
besides
the
aid
received
from
the
citizens
and
yet
it
fell
in
little
more
than
four
months
before
an
army
of
eighty
thousand
under
titus
how
great
must
have
been
the
military
science
that
could
reduce
a
place
of
such
strength
in
so
short
a
time
without
the
aid
of
other
artillery
than
the
ancient
catapult
and
whether
the
military
science
of
the
romans
was
superior
or
inferior
to
our
own
no
one
can
question
that
it
was
as
perfect
as
it
could
be
lacking
any
knowledge
of
gunpowder
we
surpass
them
only
in
the
application
of
this
great
invention
especially
in
artillery
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
a
roman
army
was
superior
to
a
feudal
army
in
the
brightest
days
of
chivalry
the
world
has
produced
no
generals
greater
than
caesar
pompey
sulla
and
marius
no
armies
ever
won
greater
victories
over
superior
numbers
than
the
roman
and
no
armies
of
their
size
ever
retained
in
submission
so
vast
an
empire
and
for
so
long
a
time
at
no
period
in
the
history
of
the
roman
empire
were
the
armies
so
large
as
those
sustained
by
france
in
time
of
peace
two
hundred
thousand
legionaries
and
as
many
more
auxiliaries
controlled
diverse
nations
and
powerful
monarchies
the
single
province
of
syria
once
boasted
of
a
military
force
equal
in
the
number
of
soldiers
to
that
wielded
by
the
emperor
tiberius
roman
legions
made
the
conquest
of
the
world
and
retained
that
conquest
for
five
hundred
years
the
energy
of
caesar
in
gaul
puts
to
the
blush
the
efforts
of
all
modern
generals
unless
we
except
frederic
marlborough
napoleon
wellington
grant
sherman
and
a
few
other
great
geniuses
whom
warlike
crises
have
developed
nor
is
there
a
better
on
the
art
of
war
than
that
furnished
by
caesar
himself
in
his
commentaries
the
great
victories
of
the
romans
over
barbarians
over
gauls
over
carthaginians
over
greeks
over
syrians
over
persians
were
not
the
result
of
a
enthusiasm
like
those
of
attila
and
tamerlane
but
extended
over
a
thousand
years
the
romans
were
essentially
military
in
all
their
tastes
and
habits
luxurious
senators
and
nobles
showed
the
greatest
courage
and
skill
in
the
most
difficult
campaigns
antony
caesar
pompey
and
lucullus
at
home
were
enervated
and
but
at
the
head
of
their
legions
they
were
capable
of
any
privation
and
fatigue
the
roman
legion
was
a
most
perfect
organization
a
great
mechanical
force
and
could
sustain
furious
attacks
after
vigor
patriotism
and
public
spirit
had
fled
for
three
hundred
years
a
vast
empire
was
sustained
by
mechanism
alone
the
legion
is
coeval
with
the
foundation
of
rome
but
the
number
of
the
troops
of
which
it
was
composed
varied
at
different
periods
it
rarely
exceeded
six
thousand
men
gibbon
estimates
the
number
at
six
thousand
eight
hundred
and
men
for
many
centuries
it
was
composed
exclusively
of
roman
citizens
up
to
the
year
no
one
was
permitted
to
serve
among
the
regular
troops
except
those
who
were
regarded
as
possessing
a
strong
personal
interest
in
the
stability
of
the
republic
marius
admitted
all
orders
of
citizens
and
after
the
close
of
the
social
war
the
whole
free
population
of
italy
was
allowed
to
serve
in
the
regular
army
claudius
incorporated
with
the
legion
the
vanquished
goths
and
after
him
the
barbarians
filled
up
the
ranks
on
account
of
the
degeneracy
of
the
times
but
during
the
period
when
the
romans
were
conquering
the
world
every
citizen
was
trained
to
arms
like
the
germans
of
the
present
day
and
was
liable
to
be
called
upon
to
serve
in
the
armies
in
the
early
age
of
the
republic
the
legion
was
disbanded
as
soon
as
the
special
service
was
performed
and
was
in
all
essential
respects
a
militia
for
three
centuries
we
have
no
record
of
a
roman
army
wintering
in
the
field
but
when
southern
italy
became
the
seat
of
war
and
especially
when
rome
was
menaced
by
foreign
enemies
and
still
more
when
a
protracted
foreign
service
became
inevitable
the
same
soldiers
remained
in
activity
for
several
years
gradually
the
distinction
between
the
soldier
and
the
civilian
was
entirely
obliterated
the
distant
wars
of
the
republic
such
as
the
prolonged
operations
of
caesar
in
gaul
and
the
civil
contests
made
a
standing
army
a
necessity
during
the
civil
wars
between
caesar
and
pompey
the
legions
were
forty
in
number
under
augustus
but
alexander
severus
increased
them
to
this
was
the
standing
force
of
the
empire
from
one
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
to
two
hundred
and
forty
thousand
men
stationed
in
the
various
provinces
the
main
dependence
of
the
legion
was
on
the
infantry
which
wore
heavy
armor
consisting
of
helmet
breastplate
greaves
on
the
right
leg
and
on
the
left
arm
a
buckler
four
feet
in
length
and
two
and
a
half
in
width
the
helmet
was
originally
made
of
leather
or
untanned
skin
strengthened
and
adorned
by
bronze
or
gold
and
surmounted
by
a
crest
which
was
often
of
and
so
made
as
to
give
an
imposing
look
the
crests
served
not
only
for
ornament
but
to
distinguish
the
different
centurions
the
breastplate
or
cuirass
was
generally
made
of
metal
and
sometimes
was
highly
ornamented
was
also
used
the
greaves
were
of
bronze
or
brass
with
a
lining
of
leather
or
felt
and
reached
above
the
knees
the
shield
worn
by
the
infantry
was
not
round
like
that
of
the
early
greeks
but
oval
or
oblong
adapted
to
the
shape
of
the
body
such
as
was
adopted
by
philip
and
alexander
and
was
made
of
wood
or
the
weapons
were
a
light
spear
a
pilum
or
javelin
over
six
feet
long
terminated
by
a
steel
point
and
a
short
sword
with
a
double
edge
besides
the
armor
and
weapons
of
the
legionary
he
usually
carried
on
the
marches
provisions
for
two
weeks
three
or
four
stakes
used
in
forming
the
palisade
of
the
camp
besides
various
tools
altogether
a
burden
of
sixty
or
eighty
pounds
per
man
the
legion
was
drawn
up
eight
deep
and
three
feet
intervened
between
rank
and
file
which
disposition
gave
great
activity
and
made
it
superior
to
the
macedonian
phalanx
the
strength
of
which
depended
on
sixteen
ranks
of
long
pikes
wedged
together
the
general
period
of
service
for
the
infantry
was
twenty
years
after
which
the
soldier
received
a
discharge
together
with
a
bounty
in
money
or
land
the
cavalry
attached
to
each
legion
consisted
of
three
hundred
men
who
originally
were
selected
from
the
leading
men
in
the
state
they
were
mounted
at
the
expense
of
the
state
and
formed
a
distinct
order
the
cavalry
was
divided
into
ten
squadrons
to
each
legion
was
attached
also
a
train
of
ten
military
engines
of
the
largest
size
and
of
the
smaller
all
of
which
discharged
stones
and
darts
with
great
effect
this
train
corresponded
with
our
artillery
the
roman
legion
whether
it
was
composed
of
four
thousand
men
as
in
the
early
ages
of
the
republic
or
six
thousand
as
in
the
time
of
augustus
was
divided
into
ten
cohorts
and
each
cohort
was
composed
of
hastati
raw
troops
principes
trained
troops
triarii
veterans
and
velites
light
troops
or
skirmishers
the
soldiers
of
the
first
line
called
hastati
consisted
of
youths
in
the
bloom
of
manhood
who
were
distributed
into
fifteen
companies
or
maniples
each
company
contained
sixty
privates
two
centurions
and
a
two
thirds
were
heavily
armed
and
bore
the
long
shield
the
remainder
carried
only
a
spear
and
light
javelins
the
second
line
the
principes
was
composed
of
men
in
the
full
vigor
of
life
divided
also
into
fifteen
companies
all
heavily
armed
and
distinguished
by
the
splendor
of
their
equipments
the
third
body
the
triarii
was
composed
of
tried
veterans
in
fifteen
companies
the
least
trustworthy
of
which
were
placed
in
the
rear
these
formed
three
lines
the
velites
were
troops
employed
on
duty
and
mingled
with
the
horsemen
the
hastati
were
so
called
because
they
were
armed
with
the
or
spear
the
principes
for
being
placed
so
near
to
the
front
the
triarii
from
having
been
arrayed
behind
the
first
two
lines
as
a
body
of
reserve
the
triarii
were
armed
with
the
pilum
thicker
and
stronger
than
the
grecian
lance
four
and
a
half
feet
long
of
wood
with
a
barbed
head
of
iron
so
that
the
whole
length
of
the
weapon
was
six
feet
nine
inches
it
was
used
either
to
throw
or
thrust
with
and
when
it
pierced
the
enemy
shield
the
iron
head
was
bent
and
the
spear
owing
to
the
twist
in
the
iron
still
held
to
the
shield
each
soldier
carried
two
of
these
weapons
and
threw
the
heavy
pilum
over
the
heads
of
their
comrades
in
front
in
order
to
break
the
enemy
line
in
the
time
of
the
empire
when
the
legion
was
modified
the
infantry
wore
cuirasses
and
helmets
and
carried
a
sword
and
dagger
the
select
infantry
were
armed
with
a
long
spear
and
a
shield
the
rest
with
a
pilum
each
man
carried
a
saw
a
basket
a
mattock
a
hatchet
a
leather
strap
a
hook
a
chain
and
provisions
for
three
days
the
equites
cavalry
wore
helmets
and
cuirasses
like
the
infantry
having
a
broadsword
at
the
right
side
and
in
the
hand
a
long
pole
a
buckler
swung
at
the
horse
flank
they
were
also
furnished
with
a
quiver
containing
three
or
four
javelins
the
artillery
were
used
both
for
hurling
missiles
in
battle
and
for
the
attack
on
fortresses
the
which
was
an
elastic
instrument
discharged
stones
and
darts
and
was
held
in
general
use
until
the
discovery
of
gunpowder
in
besieging
a
city
the
ram
was
employed
for
destroying
the
lower
part
of
a
wall
and
the
which
discharged
stones
was
used
to
overthrow
the
battlements
the
balista
would
project
a
stone
weighing
from
fifty
to
three
hundred
pounds
the
or
consisted
of
a
large
beam
made
of
the
trunk
of
a
tree
frequently
one
hundred
feet
in
length
to
one
end
of
which
was
fastened
a
mace
of
iron
or
bronze
resembling
in
form
the
head
of
a
ram
it
was
often
suspended
by
ropes
from
a
beam
fixed
transversely
over
it
so
that
the
soldiers
were
relieved
from
supporting
its
weight
and
were
able
to
give
it
a
rapid
and
forcible
swinging
motion
backward
and
forward
when
this
machine
was
further
perfected
by
rigging
it
upon
wheels
and
constructing
over
it
a
roof
so
as
to
form
a
which
protected
the
besieging
party
from
the
assaults
of
the
besieged
there
was
no
tower
so
strong
no
wall
so
thick
as
to
resist
a
attack
the
great
length
of
the
beam
enabling
the
soldiers
to
work
across
the
defensive
ditch
and
as
many
as
one
hundred
men
being
often
employed
upon
it
the
romans
learned
from
the
greeks
the
art
of
building
this
formidable
engine
which
was
used
with
great
effect
by
alexander
but
with
still
greater
by
titus
in
the
siege
of
jerusalem
it
was
first
used
by
the
romans
in
the
siege
of
syracuse
the
was
a
sort
of
roof
under
which
the
soldiers
protected
themselves
when
they
undermined
walls
the
also
used
in
the
attack
on
cities
was
a
square
tower
furnished
with
all
the
means
of
assault
this
also
was
a
greek
invention
and
the
one
used
by
demetrius
at
the
siege
of
rhodes
was
one
hundred
and
feet
high
and
wide
divided
into
nine
stories
the
a
tower
of
the
same
class
was
used
both
by
greeks
and
romans
and
even
by
asiatics
mithridates
used
one
at
the
siege
of
cyzicus
one
hundred
and
fifty
feet
in
height
these
most
formidable
engines
were
generally
made
of
beams
of
wood
covered
on
three
sides
with
iron
and
sometimes
with
rawhides
they
were
higher
than
the
walls
and
all
the
other
fortifications
of
a
besieged
place
and
divided
into
stories
pierced
with
windows
in
and
upon
them
were
stationed
archers
and
slingers
and
in
the
lower
story
was
a
the
soldiers
in
the
turris
were
also
provided
with
sometimes
on
wheels
so
that
when
the
top
of
the
wall
was
cleared
by
means
of
the
turris
it
might
be
scaled
by
means
of
the
ladders
it
was
impossible
to
resist
these
powerful
engines
except
by
burning
them
or
by
undermining
the
ground
upon
which
they
stood
or
by
overturning
them
with
stones
or
beams
hung
from
a
mast
on
the
wall
or
by
increasing
the
height
of
the
wall
or
by
erecting
temporary
towers
on
the
wall
beside
them
thus
there
was
no
ancient
fortification
capable
of
withstanding
a
long
siege
when
the
besieged
city
was
short
of
defenders
or
provisions
with
forces
equal
between
the
combatants
an
attack
was
generally
a
failure
for
the
defenders
had
always
a
great
advantage
but
when
the
number
of
defenders
was
reduced
or
when
famine
pressed
the
skill
and
courage
of
the
assailants
would
ultimately
triumph
some
ancient
cities
made
a
most
obstinate
resistance
like
tarentum
like
carthage
which
stood
a
siege
of
four
years
like
numantia
in
spain
and
like
jerusalem
when
cities
were
of
immense
size
population
and
resources
like
rome
when
besieged
by
alaric
it
was
easier
to
take
them
by
cutting
off
all
ingress
and
egress
so
as
to
produce
famine
tyre
was
taken
by
alexander
only
by
cutting
off
the
harbor
cyrus
could
not
have
taken
babylon
by
assault
since
the
walls
were
of
such
enormous
height
and
the
ditch
was
too
wide
for
the
use
of
he
resorted
to
an
expedient
of
which
the
blinded
inhabitants
of
that
doomed
city
never
dreamed
which
rendered
their
impregnable
fortifications
useless
nor
probably
would
the
romans
have
prevailed
against
jerusalem
had
not
famine
decimated
and
weakened
its
defenders
fortified
cities
though
scarcely
ever
impregnable
were
yet
more
in
use
in
ancient
than
modern
times
and
greatly
delayed
the
operations
of
advancing
armies
and
it
was
probably
the
fortified
camp
of
the
romans
which
protected
an
army
against
surprises
and
other
misfortunes
that
gave
such
permanent
efficacy
to
the
legions
the
chief
officers
of
the
legion
were
the
tribunes
and
originally
there
was
one
in
each
legion
from
the
three
tribes
the
ramnes
luceres
and
tities
in
the
time
of
polybius
the
number
in
each
legion
was
six
their
authority
extended
equally
over
the
whole
legion
but
to
prevent
confusion
it
was
the
custom
for
them
to
divide
into
three
sections
of
two
and
each
pair
undertook
the
routine
duties
for
two
months
out
of
six
they
nominated
the
centurions
and
assigned
each
to
the
company
to
which
he
belonged
these
tribunes
at
first
were
chosen
the
by
the
kings
and
consuls
but
during
the
palmy
days
of
the
republic
when
the
patrician
power
was
they
were
elected
by
the
people
that
is
the
citizens
later
they
were
named
half
by
the
senate
and
half
by
the
consuls
no
one
was
eligible
to
this
great
office
who
had
not
served
ten
years
in
the
infantry
or
five
in
the
cavalry
the
tribunes
were
distinguished
by
their
dress
from
the
common
soldier
next
in
rank
to
the
tribunes
who
corresponded
to
the
rank
of
brigadiers
and
colonels
in
our
times
were
the
centurions
of
whom
there
were
sixty
in
each
legion
men
who
were
more
remarkable
for
calmness
and
sagacity
than
for
courage
and
daring
valor
men
who
would
keep
their
posts
at
all
hazards
it
was
their
duty
to
drill
the
soldiers
to
inspect
arms
clothing
and
food
to
visit
the
sentinels
and
regulate
the
conduct
of
the
men
they
had
the
power
of
inflicting
corporal
punishment
they
were
chosen
for
merit
solely
until
the
later
ages
of
the
empire
when
their
posts
were
bought
as
is
the
case
to
some
extent
in
the
english
army
the
centurions
were
of
unequal
rank
those
of
the
triarii
before
those
of
the
principes
and
those
of
the
principes
before
those
of
the
hastati
the
first
centurion
of
the
first
maniple
of
the
triarii
stood
next
in
rank
to
the
tribunes
and
had
a
seat
in
the
military
councils
his
office
was
very
lucrative
to
his
charge
was
intrusted
the
eagle
of
the
legion
as
the
centurion
might
rise
from
the
ranks
by
regular
gradation
through
the
different
maniples
of
the
hastati
principes
and
triarii
there
was
great
inducement
held
out
to
the
soldiers
it
would
however
appear
that
the
centurion
received
only
twice
the
pay
of
the
ordinary
legionary
there
was
not
therefore
so
much
difference
in
rank
between
a
private
and
a
captain
as
there
is
in
our
day
there
were
no
aristocratic
distinctions
in
the
ancient
world
so
marked
as
those
existing
in
the
modern
in
the
roman
legion
there
was
nevertheless
a
regular
gradation
of
rank
although
there
were
but
few
distinct
offices
the
gradation
was
determined
not
by
length
of
service
but
for
merit
alone
of
which
the
tribunes
were
the
sole
judges
hence
the
tribune
in
a
roman
legion
had
more
power
than
that
of
a
modern
colonel
as
the
tribunes
named
the
centurions
so
the
centurions
appointed
their
lieutenants
who
were
called
still
below
these
were
two
or
sergeants
and
the
or
corporal
to
every
ten
men
there
was
a
change
in
the
constitution
and
disposition
of
the
legion
after
the
time
of
marius
until
the
fall
of
the
republic
the
legions
were
thrown
open
to
men
of
all
grades
they
were
all
armed
and
equipped
alike
the
lines
were
reduced
to
two
with
a
space
between
every
two
cohorts
of
which
there
were
five
in
each
line
the
young
soldiers
were
placed
in
the
rear
the
distinction
between
hastati
principes
and
triarii
ceased
the
velites
disappeared
their
work
being
done
by
the
foreign
mercenaries
the
cavalry
ceased
to
be
part
of
the
legion
and
became
a
distinct
body
and
the
military
was
completely
severed
from
the
rest
of
the
state
formerly
no
one
could
aspire
to
office
who
had
not
completed
ten
years
of
military
service
but
in
the
time
of
cicero
a
man
could
pass
through
all
the
great
dignities
of
the
state
with
a
very
limited
experience
of
military
life
cicero
himself
did
military
service
in
but
one
campaign
under
the
emperors
there
were
still
other
changes
the
regular
army
consisted
of
legions
and
supplementa
the
latter
being
subdivided
into
the
imperial
guards
and
the
auxiliary
troops
the
auxiliaries
consisted
of

or

to
furnish

the
infantry
of
the
allies
was
generally
more
numerous
than
that
of
the
romans
while
the
cavalry
was
three
times
as
numerous
all
the
auxiliaries
were
paid
by
the
state
their
infantry
received
the
same
pay
as
the
roman
infantry
but
their
cavalry
received
only
two
thirds
of
what
was
paid
to
the
roman
cavalry
the

received
in
the
time
of
polybius
three
and
a
half
asses
a

equal
to
about
three
cents
the
horseman
three
times
as
much
the
praetorian
cohorts
received
twice
as
much
as
the
legionaries
julius
caesar
allowed
about
six
asses
a
day
as
the
pay
of
the
legionary
and
under
augustus
the
daily
pay
was
raised
to
ten
asses
little
more
than
eight
cents
per
day
domitian
raised
the
stipend
still
higher
the
soldier
however
was
fed
and
clothed
by
the
government
the
praetorian
cohort
was
a
select
body
of
troops
instituted
by
augustus
to
protect
his
person
and
consisted
of
ten
cohorts
each
of
one
thousand
men
chosen
from
italy
this
number
was
increased
by
vitellius
to
sixteen
thousand
and
they
were
assembled
by
tiberius
in
a
permanent
camp
which
was
strongly
fortified
they
had
peculiar
privileges
and
when
they
had
served
sixteen
years
received
twenty
thousand
sesterces
or
more
than
one
hundred
pounds
sterling
each
praetorian
had
the
rank
of
a
centurion
in
the
regular
army
like
the
of
louis
xiv
they
were
all
gentlemen
and
formed
gradually
a
great
power
like
the
janissaries
at
constantinople
and
frequently
disposed
of
the
purple
itself
our
notice
of
the
roman
legion
would
be
incomplete
without
some
description
of
the
camp
in
which
the
soldier
virtually
lived
a
roman
army
never
halted
for
a
single
night
without
forming
a
regular
intrenchment
capable
of
holding
all
the
fighting
men
the
beasts
of
burden
and
the
baggage
during
the
winter
months
when
the
army
could
not
retire
into
some
city
it
was
compelled
to
live
in
the
camp
which
was
arranged
and
fortified
according
to
a
uniform
plan
so
that
every
company
and
individual
had
a
place
assigned
we
can
not
tell
when
this
practice
of
intrenchment
began
it
was
matured
gradually
like
all
other
things
pertaining
to
all
arts
the
system
was
probably
brought
to
perfection
during
the
wars
with
hannibal
skill
in
the
choice
of
ground
giving
facilities
for
attack
and
defence
and
for
procuring
water
and
other
necessities
was
of
great
account
with
the
generals
an
area
of
about
five
thousand
square
feet
was
allowed
for
a
company
of
infantry
and
ten
thousand
feet
for
a
troop
of
thirty
dragoons
the
form
of
a
camp
was
an
exact
square
the
length
of
each
side
being
two
thousand
and
seventeen
feet
there
was
a
space
of
two
hundred
feet
between
the
ramparts
and
the
tents
to
facilitate
the
marching
in
and
out
of
soldiers
and
to
guard
the
cattle
and
booty
the
principal
street
was
one
hundred
feet
wide
and
was
called
principia
the
defences
of
the
camp
consisted
of
a
ditch
the
earth
from
which
was
thrown
inward
and
of
strong
palisades
of
wooden
stakes
driven
into
the
top
of
the
earthwork
so
formed
the
ditch
was
sometimes
fifteen
feet
deep
and
the
or
rampart
ten
feet
in
height
when
the
army
encamped
for
the
first
time
the
tribunes
administered
an
oath
to
each
individual
including
slaves
to
the
effect
that
they
would
steal
nothing
out
of
the
camp
every
morning
at
daybreak
the
centurions
and
the
equites
presented
themselves
before
the
tents
of
the
tribunes
and
the
tribunes
in
like
manner
presented
themselves
before
the
praetorian
to
learn
the
orders
of
the
consuls
which
through
the
centurions
were
communicated
to
the
soldiers
four
companies
took
charge
of
the
principal
street
to
see
that
it
was
properly
cleaned
and
watered
one
company
took
charge
of
the
tent
of
the
tribune
a
strong
guard
attended
to
the
horses
and
another
of
fifty
men
stood
beside
the
tent
of
the
general
that
he
might
be
protected
from
open
danger
and
secret
treachery
the
mounted
guard
the
whole
night
and
day
along
the
whole
extent
of
the
vallum
and
each
gate
was
guarded
by
ten
men
the
were
intrusted
with
the
duty
of
acting
as
sentinels
during
the
night
and
most
ingenious
measures
were
adopted
to
secure
their
watchfulness
and
fidelity
the
watchword
for
the
night
was
given
by
the
on
the
first
signal
being
given
by
the
trumpet
the
tents
were
all
struck
and
the
baggage
packed
at
the
second
signal
the
baggage
was
placed
upon
the
beasts
of
burden
and
at
the
third
the
whole
army
began
to
move
then
the
herald
standing
at
the
right
hand
of
the
general
demands
thrice
if
they
are
ready
for
war
to
which
they
all
respond
with
loud
and
repeated
cheers
that
they
are
ready
and
for
the
most
part
being
filled
with
martial
ardor

from
what
has
come
down
to
us
of
roman
military
life
it
appears
to
have
been
full
of
excitement
toil
danger
and
hardship
the
pecuniary
rewards
of
the
soldier
were
small
he
was
paid
in
glory
no
profession
brought
so
much
honor
as
the
military
and
it
was
from
the
undivided
attention
of
a
great
people
to
this
profession
that
it
was
carried
to
all
the
perfection
which
could
be
attained
before
the
great
invention
of
gunpowder
changed
the
art
of
war
it
was
not
the
number
of
men
employed
in
the
roman
armies
which
particularly
arrests
attention
but
the
genius
of
organization
which
controlled
and
the
spirit
which
animated
them
the
romans
loved
war
but
so
reduced
it
to
a
science
that
it
required
comparatively
small
armies
to
conquer
the
world
sulla
defeated
mithridates
with
only
thirty
thousand
men
while
his
adversary
marshalled
against
him
over
one
hundred
thousand
caesar
had
only
ten
legions
to
effect
the
conquest
of
gaul
and
none
of
these
were
of
italian
origin
at
the
great
decisive
battle
of
pharsalia
when
most
of
the
available
forces
of
the
empire
were
employed
on
one
side
or
the
other
pompey
commanded
a
legionary
army
of
thousand
men
and
his
cavalry
amounted
to
seven
thousand
more
but
among
them
were
included
the
flower
of
the
roman
nobility
the
auxiliary
force
has
not
been
computed
although
it
was
probably
numerous
in
the
same
battle
caesar
had
under
him
only
thousand
legionaries
and
one
thousand
cavalry
but
every
man
in
both
armies
was
prepared
to
conquer
or
die
the
forces
were
posted
on
the
open
plain
and
the
battle
was
really
a
encounter
in
which
the
soldiers
after
hurling
their
lances
fought
with
their
swords
chiefly
and
when
the
cavalry
of
pompey
rushed
upon
the
legionaries
of
caesar
no
blows
were
wasted
on
the
mailed
panoply
of
the
mounted
romans
but
were
aimed
at
the
face
alone
as
that
only
was
unprotected
the
battle
was
decided
by
the
coolness
bravery
and
discipline
of
caesar
veterans
inspired
by
the
genius
of
the
greatest
general
of
antiquity
less
than
one
hundred
thousand
men
in
all
probability
were
engaged
in
one
of
the
most
memorable
conflicts
which
the
world
has
seen
thus
it
was
by
blended
art
and
heroism
that
the
roman
legions
prevailed
over
the
armies
of
the
ancient
world
but
this
military
power
was
not
gained
in
a
say
it
took
nearly
two
hundred
years
after
the
expulsion
of
the
kings
to
regain
supremacy
over
the
neighboring
people
and
another
century
to
conquer
italy
the
romans
did
not
contend
with
regular
armies
until
they
were
brought
in
conflict
with
the
king
of
epirus
and
the
phalanx
of
the
greeks
which
improved
their
military
tactics
and
introduced
between
the
combatants
those
mutual
regards
of
civilized
nations
which
teach
men
to
honor
their
adversaries
to
spare
the
vanquished
and
to
lay
aside
wrath
when
the
struggle
is
ended
after
the
consolidation
of

power

cicero
roman
literature
marcus
tullius
cicero
is
one
of
the
great
lights
of
history
because
his
genius
and
influence
were
directed
to
the
conservation
of
what
was
most
precious
in
civilization
among
the
cultivated
nations
of
antiquity
he
was
not
a
warrior
like
so
many
of
the
roman
senators
but
his
excellence
was
higher
than
that
of
a
conqueror
he
was
doomed
by
his
literary
genius
to
an
immortality
and
was
confessedly
the
most
prominent
figure
in
the
political
history
of
his
time
next
to
caesar
and
pompey
his
influence
was
greater
than
his
power
reaching
down
to
our
time
and
if
his
character
had
faults
let
us
remember
that
he
was
stained
by
no
crimes
and
vices
in
an
age
of
violence
and
wickedness
until
lately
he
has
received
almost
unmixed
praise
the
fathers
of
the
church
revered
him
to
erasmus
as
well
as
to
jerome

he
was

new
rather
than
what

true
cicero
was
born
in
the
little
suburban
town
of
arpinum
about
fifty
miles
from
rome
the
town
which
produced
marius
the
period
of
his
birth
was
one
of
marked
national
prosperity
great
military
roads
were
built
which
were
a
marvel
of
engineering
skill
canals
were
dug
sails
whitened
the
sea
commerce
was
prosperous
the
arts
of
greece
were
introduced
and
its
literature
also
elegant
villas
lined
the
shores
of
the
mediterranean
pictures
and
statues
were
indefinitely
multiplied
everything
indicated
an
increase
of
wealth
and
culture
with
these
triumphs
of
art
and
science
and
literature
we
are
compelled
to
notice
likewise
a
decline
in
morals
money
had
become
the
god
which
everybody
worshipped
religious
life
faded
away
there
was
a
general
eclipse
of
faith
an
epicurean
life
produced
an
epicurean
philosophy
was
universal
and
even
revolting
in
the
sports
of
the
amphitheatre
sensualism
became
the
convertible
word
for
utilities
the
romans
were
thus
rapidly
advancing
to
a
materialistic
millennium
an
outward
progress
of
wealth
and
industries
but
an
inward
decline
in
those
virtues
on
which
the
strength
of
man
is
based
accompanied
with
seditions
among
the
people
luxury
and
pride
among
the
nobles
and
usurpations
on
the
part
of
successful
generals
when
cicero
began
his
memorable
career
he
was
but
not
of
noble
ancestors
the
great
peculiarity
of
his
youth
was
his
precocity
he
was
an
intellectual
prodigy
like
pitt
macaulay
and
mill
like
them
he
had
a
wonderful
memory
he
early
mastered
the
greek
language
he
wrote
poetry
studied
under
eminent
professors
frequented
the
forum
listened
to
the
speeches
of
different
orators
watched
the
posture
and
gestures
of
actors
and
plunged
into
the
mazes
of
literature
and
philosophy
he
was
conscious
of
his
marvellous
gifts
and
was
of
course
ambitious
of
distinction
there
were
only
three
ways
at
rome
in
which
a
man
could
rise
to
eminence
and
power
one
was
by
making
money
like
army
contractors
and
merchants
such
as
the
equites
to
whose
ranks
he
belonged
the
second
was
by
military
service
and
the
third
by
the
law
an
honorable
profession
like
caesar
a
few
years
younger
than
he
cicero
selected
the
law
but
he
was
a
not
a
patrician
as
caesar
was
and
had
few
powerful
friends
hence
his
progress
was
not
rapid
in
the
way
of
clients
he
was
years
of
age
before
he
had
a
case
he
was
when
he
defended
roscius
which
seems
to
have
brought
him
into
notice
even
as
the
fortune
of
erskine
was
made
in
the
greenwich
hospital
case
and
that
of
daniel
webster
in
the
case
of
dartmouth
college
to
have
defended
roscius
against
all
the
influence
of
sulla
then
the
most
powerful
man
in
rome
was
considered
bold
and
audacious
his
fame
for
great
logical
power
rests
on
his
defence
of
milo
the
admiration
of
all
lawyers
cicero
was
not
naturally
robust
his
figure
was
tall
and
spare
his
neck
long
and
slender
and
his
mouth
anything
but
sensual
he
looked
more
like
an
elegant
scholar
than
a
popular
public
speaker
yet
he
was
impetuous
ardent
and
fiery
like
demosthenes
resorting
to
violent
gesticulations
the
health
of
such
a
young
man
could
not
stand
the
strain
on
his
nervous
system
and
he
was
obliged
to
leave
rome
for
recreation
he
therefore
made
the
tour
of
greece
and
asia
minor
which
every
fashionable
and
cultivated
man
was
supposed
to
do
yet
he
did
not
abandon
himself
to
the
pleasures
of
cities
more
fascinating
than
rome
itself
but
pursued
his
studies
in
rhetoric
and
philosophy
under
eminent
masters
or
professors
as
we
should
now
call
them
he
remained
abroad
two
years
returning
when
he
was
thirty
years
of
age
and
settling
down
in
his
profession
taking
at
first
but
little
part
in
politics
he
married
terentia
with
whom
he
lived
happily
for
thirty
years
but
the
roman
lawyer
was
essentially
a
politician
looking
ultimately
to
political
office
since
only
through
the
great
public
offices
could
he
enter
the
senate
the
object
of
ambition
to
all
distinguished
romans
as
a
seat
in
parliament
is
the
goal
of
an
englishman
the
roman
lawyer
did
not
receive
fees
like
modern
lawyers
but
derived
his
support
from
presents
and
legacies
when
he
became
a
political
leader
a
man
of
influence
with
the
great
his
presents
were
enormous
cicero
acknowledged
late
in
life
to
have
received
what
would
now
be
equal
to
more
than
a
million
of
dollars
from
legacies
alone
the
great
political
leaders
and
orators
were
the
stipendiaries
of
eastern
princes
and
nobles
who
wanted
favors
from
the
senate
and
who
knew
as
well
how
to
reward
such
services
as
do
the
railway
kings
in
our
times
before
cicero
then
could
be
a
senator
he
must
pass
through
those
great
public
offices
which
were
in
the
gift
of
the
people
the
first
step
on
the
ladder
of
advancement
was
the
office
of
quaestor
which
entailed
the
duty
of
collecting
revenues
in
one
of
the
provinces
this
office
he
was
sufficiently
influential
to
secure
being
sent
to
sicily
where
he
distinguished
himself
for
his
activity
and
integrity
at
the
end
of
a
year
he
renewed
his
practice
in
the
courts
at
rome
being
hardly
anything
more
than
a
mere
lawyer
for
five
years
when
he
was
elected
an
aedile
to
whom
the
care
of
the
public
buildings
was
intrusted
it
was
while
he
was
that
cicero
appeared
as
the
public
prosecutor
of
verres
this
was
one
of
the
great
cases
of
antiquity
and
the
one
from
which
the
orator
public
career
fairly
dates
his
residence
in
sicily
had
prepared
him
for
this
duty
and
he
secured
the
conviction
of
this
great
criminal
whose
peculations
and
corruptions
would
amaze
our
modern
new
yorkers
and
all
the
rings
of
our
great
cities
combined
but
the
praetor
of
sicily
was
a
provincial
governor
more
like
warren
hastings
than
tweed
for
this
public
service
cicero
gained
more
than
burke
did
for
his
prosecution
of
hastings
since
hastings
though
a
corrupt
man
laid
after
clive
the
foundation
of
the
english
empire
in
india
and
was
a
man
of
immense
talents
greater
than
those
of
any
who
has
since
filled
his
place
hence
the
nation
screened
hastings
but
verres
had
no
virtues
and
no
great
abilities
he
was
an
outrageous
public
robber
and
hoped
from
his
wealth
and
powerful
connections
to
purchase
immunity
for
his
crimes
in
the
hands
of
such
an
orator
as
cicero
he
could
not
escape
the
penalty
of
the
law
powerful
as
he
was
even
at
rome
this
case
placed
cicero
above
hortensius
hitherto
the
leader
of
the
roman
bar
it
was
at
this
period
that
the
extant
correspondence
of
cicero
began
which
is
the
best
picture
we
have
of
the
manners
and
habits
of
the
roman
aristocracy
at
the
time
history
could
scarcely
spare
those
famous
letters
especially
to
atticus
in
which
also
the
private
life
and
character
of
cicero
shine
to
the
most
advantage
revealing
no
vices
no
treacheries
only
egotism
vanity
and
vacillation
and
a
way
that
some
have
of
speaking
about
people
in
private
very
differently
from
what
they
say
in
public
which
looks
like
insincerity
in
these
letters
cicero
appears
as
a
very
frank
man
genial
hospitable
domestic
witty
whose
society
and
conversation
must
have
been
delightful
in
no
modern
correspondence
do
we
see
a
higher
perfection
in
the
polished
courtesies
and
urbanities
of
social
life
with
the
alloy
of
vanity
irony
and
discontent
but
in
these
letters
he
also
evinces
a
friendship
which
is
immortal
and
what
is
nobler
than
the
capacity
of
friendship
in
these
he
not
only
shines
as
a
cultivated
scholar
but
as
a
great
statesman
and
patriot
living
for
the
good
of
his
country
though
not
unmindful
of
the
luxuries
of
home
and
the
charms
of
country
retirement
and
those
enjoyments
which
are
ever
associated
with
refined
and
favored
life
we
read
here
of
pictures
books
medals
statues
curiosities
of
every
kind
all
of
which
adorned
his
various
villas
as
well
as
his
magnificent
palace
on
mount
palatine
which
cost
him
what
would
be
equal
in
our
money
to
two
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
dollars
to
keep
up
this
town
house
and
some
fifteen
villas
in
different
parts
of
italy
and
to
feast
the
greatest
nobles
like
pompey
and
caesar
would
imply
that
his
income
was
enormous
much
greater
than
that
of
any
modern
professional
man
and
yet
he
seems
to
have
lived
like
bacon
and
our
webster
beyond
his
income
and
was
in
debt
the
greater
part
of
his
life
another
flaw
in
his
character
for
i
do
not
wish
to
paint
him
without
faults
but
only
as
a
good
as
well
as
a
great
man
for
his
times
his
private
character
was
as
lofty
as
that
of
chatham
or
canning
if
we
could
forget
his
vanity
which
after
all
is
not
so
offensive
as
the
intellectual
pride
of
burke
and
pitt
and
of
sundry
other
great
lights
who
might
be
mentioned
conscious
of
their
gifts
and
attainments
there
is
something
very
different
in
the
egotism
of
a
silly
and
aristocrat
from
that
of
a
great
benefactor
who
has
something
to
be
proud
of
and
with
whose
private
experiences
the
greatest
national
deeds
are
connected
i
speak
of
this
fault
because
it
has
been
handled
too
severely
by
modern
critics
what
were
the
faults
of
cicero
compared
with
those
of
theodosius
or
constantine
to
say
nothing
of
his
contemporaries
like
caesar
before
whom
so
much
incense
has
been
burned
at
the
age
of
forty
cicero
became
praetor
or
supreme
judge
this
office
when
it
expired
entitled
him
to
a
provincial
government
the
great
ultimate
ambition
of
a
senator
since
the
administration
of
a
province
even
for
a
single
year
usually
secured
an
enormous
fortune
but
this
tempting
offer
he
resigned
since
he
felt
he
could
not
be
spared
from
rome
in
such
a
crisis
of
public
affairs
when
the
fortunate
generals
were
grasping
power
and
the
demagogues
were
almost
preparing
the
way
for
despotism
some
might
say
he
was
a
and
ambitious
statesman
who
could
not
afford
to
weaken
his
chances
of
being
made
consul
by
absence
from
the
capital
this
great
office
the
consulship
the
highest
in
the
gift
of
the
people
which
gave
supreme
executive
control
was
rarely
conferred
although
elective
upon
any
but
senators
of
ancient
family
and
enormous
wealth
it
was
as
difficult
for
a
new
man
to
reach
this
dignity
under
an
aristocratic
constitution
as
for
a
commoner
a
hundred
years
ago
to
become
prime
minister
of
england
transcendent
talents
and
services
scarcely
sufficed
only
generals
who
had
won
great
military
fame
or
the
highest
of
the
nobles
stood
much
chance
for
a
lawyer
to
aim
at
the
highest
office
in
the
state
without
a
great
family
to
back
him
would
have
been
deemed
as
audacious
as
for
such
a
man
as
burke
to
aspire
to
a
seat
in
the
cabinet
during
the
reign
of
george
iii
a
lawyer
at
rome
like
a
lawyer
in
london
might
become
a
lord
chancellor
or
praetor
but
not
easily
a
prime
minister
he
would
be
defeated
by
aristocratic
influence
and
jealousies
although
the
people
had
the
right
of
election
they
voted
at
the
dictation
of
those
who
had
money
and
power
yet
cicero
obtained
the
consulship
probably
with
the
aid
of
senators
which
he
justly
regarded
as
a
great
triumph
it
was
a
very
unusual
thing
it
was
more
marvellous
than
for
a
jew
to
reign
in
great
britain
or
like
mordecai
in
the
court
of
a
persian
king
the
most
distinguished
service
of
cicero
as
consul
was
to
ferret
out
the
conspiracy
of
catiline
now
this
traitor
belonged
to
the
very
highest
rank
in
a
senate
of
nobles
he
was
like
an
ancient
duke
in
the
british
house
of
peers
it
was
no
easy
thing
for
a
plebeian
consul
to
bring
to
justice
so
great
a
culprit
he
was
more
formidable
than
essex
in
the
reign
of
elizabeth
or
bassompierre
in
the
time
of
richelieu
he
was
a
man
of
profligate
life
but
of
marked
ability
and
boundless
ambition
he
had
a
band
of
numerous
and
faithful
followers
armed
and
desperate
he
was
also
one
of
those
oily
and
aristocratic
demagogues
who
bewitch
the
people
not
as
in
our
times
by
sophistries
but
by
flatteries
he
was
as
debauched
as
mirabeau
but
without
his
patriotism
though
like
him
he
aimed
to
overturn
the
constitution
by
allying
himself
with
the
democracy
the
people
whom
he
despised
he
gained
by
his
money
and
promises
and
he
had
powerful
confederates
of
his
own
rank
so
that
he
was
on
the
point
of
deluging
rome
with
blood
his
aim
being
nothing
less
than
the
extermination
of
the
senate
and
the
magistrates
by
assassination
and
a
general
division
of
the
public
treasure
with
personal
assumption
of
public
power
but
all
his
schemes
were
foiled
by
cicero
who
added
unwearied
activity
to
extraordinary
penetration
for
this
great
and
signal
service
cicero
received
the
highest
tribute
the
state
could
render
he
was
called
the
savior
of
his
country
and
he
succeeded
in
staving
off
for
a
time
the
fall
of
his
country
liberties
it
was
a
mournful
sight
to
him
to
see
the
ascendency
which
demagogues
had
already
gained
since
it
betokened
the
approaching
destruction
of
the
constitution
which
good
or
bad
was
dear
to
him
and
which
as
an
aristocrat
he
sought
to
conserve
cicero
evil
star
was
not
catiline
but
clodius
another
aristocratic
demagogue
whose
crimes
he
exposed
although
he
failed
to
bring
him
to
justice
clodius
was
shielded
by
his
powerful
connections
and
he
was
besides
a
popular
favorite
as
well
as
a
petted
scion
of
one
of
the
greatest
families
clodius
showed
his
hostility
to
cicero
and
sought
revenge
by
artfully
causing
the
people
to
pass
or
revive
a
law
that
whoever
had
inflicted
capital
punishment
on
a
citizen
without
a
trial
should
be
banished
this
seemed
to
the
people
to
be
a
protection
to
their
liberties
now
cicero
when
consul
had
executed
some
of
the
conspirators
associated
with
catiline
for
which
he
was
called
the
savior
of
his
country
but
by
the
law
which
was
now
passed
or
revived
by
the
influence
of
clodius
cicero
was
himself
a
culprit
and
it
would
seem
that
all
the
influence
of
the
senate
and
his
friends
could
not
prevent
his
exile
he
appealed
to
his
friend
pompey
but
pompey
turned
a
deaf
ear
and
also
to
caesar
but
caesar
was
then
outside
the
walls
of
the
city
in
command
of
an
army
in
fact
both
these
generals
wished
him
out
of
the
way
although
they
equally
admired
and
feared
him
for
each
of
them
was
bent
on
being
the
supreme
ruler
of
rome
so
it
was
permitted
for
the
most
illustrious
patriot
which
rome
then
held
to
go
into
exile
what
a
comment
on
the
demoralization
of
the
times
here
was
the
best
the
most
gifted
and
the
most
accomplished
man
of
the
republic
a
man
who
had
rendered
invaluable
and
acknowledged
services
that
man
of
consular
dignity
and
one
of
the
leaders
of
the
senate
sent
into
inglorious
banishment
on
a
mere
technicality
and
for
an
act
which
saved
the
state
and
the
magnanimous
caesar
and
the
illustrious
pompey
allowed
him
to
go
where
was
salvation
to
a
republic
which
banished
its
savior
and
for
having
saved
it
the
heart
sickens
over
such
a
fact
although
it
occurred
two
thousand
years
ago
when
the
citizens
of
rome
saw
that
great
man
depart
mournfully
from
among
them
and
to
all
appearance
forever
for
having
rescued
them
from
violence
and
slaughter
and
by
their
own
act
they
ought
to
have
known
that
the
days
of
the
republic
were
numbered
but
this
only
a
few
patriots
felt
and
not
only
was
cicero
banished
but
his
palace
was
burned
and
his
villas
confiscated
he
was
not
only
disgraced
but
ruined
he
was
an
exile
and
a
pauper
what
a
fall
what
an
unmerited
treatment
very
few
people
conceive
what
a
dreadful
punishment
it
was
in
greece
and
rome
to
be
banished
or
as
the
formula
went
to
be
interdicted
from
fire
and
water
the
sacred
fire
of
the
hearth
the
lustral
water
which
served
for
sacrifices
the
exile
was
deprived
of
these
by
being
forced
to
extinguish
the
the
elemental
fundamental
religion
of
a
greek
and
roman
he
could
not
deprived
of
this
hold
property
having
no
longer
a
worship
he
had
no
longer
a
family
he
ceased
to
be
a
husband
and
father
his
sons
were
no
longer
in
his
power
his
wife
was
no
longer
his
wife
and
when
he
died
he
had
not
the
right
to
be
buried
in
the
tombs
of
his
ancestors
footnote
coulanges
ancient
city
is
it
to
be
wondered
at
that
even
so
good
and
great
a
man
as
cicero
should
bitterly
feel
his
disgrace
and
misfortunes
is
it
surprising
that
philosopher
as
he
was
he
should
have
given
way
to
grief
and
despondency
he
would
have
been
more
than
human
not
to
have
lost
his
spirits
and
his
hopes
how
natural
were
grief
and
despair
in
such
complicated
miseries
especially
to
a
religious
man
chrysostom
could
support
exile
with
dignity
for
christianity
had
abolished
the
superstitions
of
greece
and
rome
as
to
household
gods
cicero
could
not
he
was
not
great
enough
for
such
a
martyrdom
it
is
true
we
should
have
esteemed
him
higher
had
he
accepted
his
fate
with
resignation
no
man
should
yield
to
despair
had
he
been
as
old
as
socrates
and
had
he
accomplished
his
mission
possibly
he
would
have
shown
more
equanimity
but
his
work
was
not
yet
done
he
was
cut
off
in
his
prime
and
in
the
midst
of
usefulness
from
his
home
his
religion
his
family
his
honor
and
his
influence
he
was
utterly
ruined
i
think
the
critics
make
too
much
of
the
grief
and
misery
of
cicero
in
his
banishment
we
may
be
disappointed
that
cicero
was
not
equal
to
his
circumstances
but
we
need
not
be
hard
on
him
my
surprise
is
not
that
he
was
overwhelmed
with
grief
but
that
he
did
not
attempt
to
drown
his
grief
in
books
and
literature
his
sole
relief
was
in
pathetic
and
unmanly
letters
the
great
injustice
of
this
punishment
naturally
produced
a
reaction
nor
could
the
romans
afford
to
lose
the
services
of
their
greatest
orator
they
also
craved
the
excitement
of
his
speeches
more
thrilling
and
delightful
than
the
performance
of
any
actor
so
he
was
recalled
cicero
ought
to
have
anticipated
this
it
seems
however
he
had
that
unfortunate
temperament
which
favors
alternate
depression
and
exhilaration
of
spirits
without
measure
or
reason
his
return
was
a
triumph
a
grand
ovation
an
unbounded
tribute
to
his
vanity
his
palace
was
rebuilt
at
the
expense
of
the
state
and
his
property
was
restored
his
popularity
was
regained
in
fact
his
influence
was
never
lost
and
because
it
was
so
great
his
enemies
wished
him
out
of
the
way
he
was
one
of
the
few
who
retain
influence
after
they
have
lost
power
the
excess
of
his
joy
on
his
restoration
to
home
and
friends
and
property
and
fame
and
position
was
as
great
as
the
excess
of
his
grief
in
his
short
exile
but
this
is
a
defect
in
temperament
in
his
mental
constitution
rather
than
a
flaw
in
his
character
we
could
have
wished
more
placidity
and
equanimity
but
to
condemn
him
because
he
was
not
great
in
everything
is
unjust
on
his
return
to
rome
cicero
resumed
his
practice
in
the
courts
with
greater
devotion
than
ever
he
was
now
past
fifty
years
of
age
in
the
prime
of
his
strength
and
in
the
height
of
his
forensic
fame
but
notwithstanding
his
success
and
honors
his
life
was
saddened
by
the
growing
dissensions
between
caesar
and
pompey
the
decline
of
public
spirit
and
the
approaching
fall
of
the
institutions
in
which
he
gloried
it
was
clear
that
one
or
the
other
of
these
fortunate
generals
would
soon
become
the
master
of
the
roman
world
and
that
liberty
was
about
to
perish
his
eloquence
now
became
sad
he
sings
the
of
departing
glories
he
wails
his
jeremiads
over
the
demoralization
which
was
sweeping
away
not
merely
liberty
but
religion
and
extinguishing
faith
in
the
world
to
console
himself
he
retired
to
one
of
his
beautiful
villas
and
wrote
that
immortal
essay
de
oratore
which
has
come
down
to
us
entire
his
literary
genius
now
blazed
equally
with
his
public
speeches
in
the
forum
and
in
the
senate
literature
was
his
solace
and
amusement
not
a
source
of
profit
or
probably
of
contemporary
fame
he
wrote
treatises
on
the
same
principles
that
he
talked
with
friends
or
that
fra
angelico
painted
pictures
he
renewed
his
attempts
in
poetry
but
failed
his
poetry
is
in
the
transcendent
rhythm
of
his
prose
compositions
like
that
of
madame
de
staël
and
macaulay
and
rousseau
but
he
was
dragged
from
his
literary
and
forensic
life
to
accept
the
office
of
a
governor
of
a
province
it
was
forced
upon
him
an
honor
to
him
without
a
charm
had
he
been
venal
and
unscrupulous
he
would
have
seized
it
with
avidity
he
was
too
conscientious
to
enrich
himself
by
public
corruption
as
other
senators
did
and
unless
he
could
accumulate
a
fortune
the
command
of
a
distant
province
was
an
honorable
exile
he
was
years
of
age
when
he
became
proconsul
of
cilicia
an
eastern
province
and
all
historians
have
united
in
praising
his
proconsulate
for
its
justice
its
integrity
and
its
ability
he
committed
no
extortions
and
returned
home
when
his
term
of
office
expired
as
poor
as
when
he
went
one
of
the
highest
praises
which
can
be
given
to
a
public
man
who
has
chances
of
enriching
himself
is
that
he
remains
poor
when
a
member
of
congress
known
not
to
be
worth
ten
thousand
dollars
returns
to
his
home
worth
one
hundred
thousand
dollars
the
public
have
an
instinct
that
he
has
somehow
or
other
been
untrue
to
himself
and
his
country
when
a
great
man
returns
home
from
washington
poorer
than
when
he
went
his
influence
is
apt
to
survive
his
power
and
this
perpetuated
influence
is
the
highest
glory
of
a
public
man
the
glory
of
jefferson
of
hamilton
of
washington
like
the
voice
of
gladstone
during
his
retirement
now
cicero
had
this
influence
as
long
as
he
lived
and
it
was
ever
exerted
for
the
good
of
his
country
had
his
country
been
free
he
would
have
died
in
honor
but
his
country
was
enslaved
and
his
voice
was
drowned
and
he
had
to
pay
the
penalty
of
speaking
the
truth
about
those
unscrupulous
men
who
usurped
authority
on
his
return
to
rome
the
state
of
public
affairs
was
most
alarming
caesar
and
pompey
were
in
antagonism
he
must
choose
between
them
and
he
distrusted
both
caesar
was
the
more
able
accomplished
and
magnanimous
but
he
was
the
more
unscrupulous
and
dangerous
he
had
ventured
to
cross
the
rubicon
the
first
general
who
ever
dared
thus
openly
to
assail
his
country
liberties
pompey
was
pompous
overrated
and
proud
and
had
been
fortunate
in
the
east
but
then
he
sided
with
the
constitutional
authorities
that
is
with
the
senate
so
far
as
his
ambition
allowed
so
cicero
took
his
side
feebly
reluctantly
as
the
least
of
the
evils
he
had
to
choose
but
not
without
vacillation
which
is
one
of
the
popular
charges
against
him
his
distraction
almost
took
the
form
of
insanity
his
inconsistency
was
an
incoherence
never
did
a
more
wretched
man
than
cicero
resort
to
pompey
camp
where
he
remained
until
his
cause
was
lost
he
returned
after
the
battle
of
pharsalia
a
suppliant
at
the
feet
of
caesar
the
conqueror
this
to
me
is
one
of
his
weakest
acts
it
would
have
been
more
lofty
and
heroic
to
have
perished
in
the
camp
of
pompey
sons
in
the
midst
of
these
public
misfortunes
which
saddened
his
soul
his
private
miseries
began
he
was
now
prematurely
an
old
man
under
sixty
years
of
age
almost
broken
down
with
grief
his
beloved
daughter
tullia
with
whom
his
life
was
bound
up
died
and
he
was
divorced
from
his
wife
terentia
a
proceeding
the
cause
of
which
remains
a
mystery
neither
in
his
most
confidential
letters
nor
in
his
conversations
with
most
intimate
friends
does
it
appear
that
he
ever
unbosomed
himself
although
he
was
the
frankest
and
most
social
of
men
in
his
impressive
silence
he
has
set
one
of
the
noblest
examples
of
a
man
afflicted
with
domestic
infelicities
he
buries
his
conjugal
troubles
in
eternal
silence
although
he
is
forced
to
give
vent
to
sorrows
so
plaintive
and
bitter
that
both
friend
and
foe
were
constrained
to
pity
he
expects
no
sympathy
even
at
rome
for
the
sundering
of
conjugal
relations
and
he
communicates
no
secrets
in
his
grief
and
sadness
he
does
however
a
most
foolish
thing
he
marries
a
young
lady
his
age
she
accepted
him
for
his
name
and
rank
he
sought
her
for
her
beauty
her
youth
and
her
fortune
this
union
of
may
with
december
was
of
course
a
failure
both
parties
were
soon
disenchanted
and
disappointed
neither
party
found
happiness
only
discontent
and
chagrin
the
everlasting
incongruities
of
such
a
relation
he
sixty
and
she
nineteen
soon
led
to
another
divorce
expected
his
young
wife
to
mourn
with
him
the
loss
of
his
daughter
tullia
expected
that
her
society
and
charms
would
be
a
compensation
for
all
that
he
had
lost
yea
more
enough
to
make
him
the
most
fortunate
and
happy
of
mortals
in
truth
he
was
too
old
a
man
to
have
married
a
young
woman
whatever
were
the
inducements
it
was
the
great
folly
of
his
life
an
illustration
of
the
fact
that
as
a
general
thing
the
older
a
man
grows
the
greater
fool
he
becomes
so
far
as
women
are
concerned
a
folly
that
disgraced
and
humiliated
the
two
wisest
and
greatest
men
who
ever
sat
on
the
jewish
throne
in
his
accumulated
sorrows
cicero
now
plunged
for
relief
into
literary
labors
it
was
thus
that
his
private
sorrows
were
the
means
which
providence
employed
to
transmit
his
precious
thoughts
and
experiences
to
future
ages
as
the
most
valued
inheritance
he
could
bestow
on
posterity
what
a
precious
legacy
to
the
mind
of
the
world
was
the
book
of
ecclesiastes
yet
by
what
bitter
experiences
was
its
wisdom
earned
it
was
in
the
short
period
when
caesar
rejoiced
in
the
mighty
power
which
he
transmitted
to
the
roman
emperors
that
cicero
wrote
in
comparative
retirement
his
history
of
roman
eloquence
his
inquiry
as
to
the
greatest
good
and
evil
his
cato
his
orator
his
nature
of
the
gods
and
his
treatises
on
glory
on
fate
on
friendship
on
old
age
and
his
grandest
work
of
all
the
offices
the
best
manual
in
ethics
which
has
come
down
to
us
from
heathen
antiquity
in
his
studious
retirement
he
reminds
us
of
bacon
after
his
fall
when
on
his
estate
surrounded
with
friends
and
in
the
enjoyment
of
elegant
leisure
he
penned
the
most
valued
of
his
immortal
compositions
and
in
those
degenerate
days
at
rome
when
liberty
was
crushed
under
foot
forever
it
is
beautiful
to
see
the
greatest
of
roman
statesmen
and
lawyers
consoling
himself
and
instructing
posterity
by
his
exhaustive
treatises
on
the
fundamental
principles
of
law
of
morality
and
of
philosophy
the
assassination
of
caesar
by
roman
senators
which
cicero
seems
to
have
foreseen
and
in
which
he
rejoiced
at
this
time
shocked
and
disturbed
the
world
for
nearly
two
thousand
years
the
verdict
of
the
civilized
world
respecting
this
great
conqueror
has
been
unanimous
but
froude
has
attempted
to
reverse
this
verdict
as
he
has
in
reference
to
henry
and
as
carlyle
another
idolater
of
force
has
attempted
in
the
cases
of
oliver
cromwell
and
frederick
ii
this
remarkable
in
his
life
of
caesar
which
is
however
interesting
from
first
to
last
as
everything
he
writes
is
interesting
has
presented
him
as
an
object
of
unbounded
admiration
as
i
have
already
noticed
in
my
lecture
on
caesar
whether
in
his
eagerness
to
say
something
new
or
from
an
hostility
to
aristocratic
and
religious
institutions
or
from
an
admiration
of
imperialism
or
disdain
of
the
people
in
their
efforts
at
this
able
special
pleader
seems
to
hail
the
roman
conqueror
as
a
benefactor
to
the
cause
of
civilization
but
imperialism
crushed
all
alike
the
people
no
longer
able
to
send
their
best
men
to
the
senate
through
the
higher
offices
perchance
to
represent
their
interests
and
the
nobles
shorn
of
the
administration
of
the
empire
soldiers
not
civilians
henceforth
were
to
rule
the
world
a
dreary
thought
to
a
great
lawyer
like
cicero
or
a
landed
proprietor
like
brutus
even
if
such
a
terrible
revolution
as
occurred
in
rome
under
caesar
may
have
been
ordered
wisely
by
a
superintending
power
for
those
degenerate
times
and
as
a
preservation
of
the
peace
of
the
world
that
christianity
might
take
root
and
spread
in
countries
where
all
religions
were
dead
still
the
prostration
of
what
was
dearest
to
the
hearts
of
all
true
citizens
by
the
sword
was
a
crime
and
men
are
not
to
be
commended
for
crime
even
if
those
crimes
may
be
palliated
it
must
need
be
that
offences
come
but
woe
to
those
by
whom
they
come
cicero
was
now
prematurely
old
discouraged
and
and
yet
he
braced
himself
up
for
one
more
grand
effort
for
a
life
and
death
struggle
with
antony
one
of
the
ablest
of
caesar
generals
a
demagogue
eloquent
and
popular
but
outrageously
cruel
and
unscrupulous
and
with
unbridled
passions
had
it
not
been
for
his
infatuated
love
of
cleopatra
he
probably
would
have
succeeded
to
the
imperial
sceptre
for
it
was
by
the
sword
that
he
too
sought
to
suppress
the
liberties
of
the
senate
and
people
against
him
as
the
enemy
of
his
country
cicero
did
not
scruple
to
launch
forth
the
most
terrible
of
his
invectives
in
thirteen
immortal
philippics
some
of
which
however
were
merely
written
and
never
delivered
after
the
fashion
of
demosthenes
with
whom
as
an
orator
and
a
patriot
he
can
alone
be
compared
he
denounced
the
unprincipled
demagogue
and
general
with
every
offensive
epithet
the
language
afforded
unveiling
his
designs
exposing
his
forgeries
and
proving
his
crimes
nobler
eloquence
was
never
uttered
and
wasted
than
that
with
which
cicero
pursued
in
passionate
vengeance
the
most
powerful
and
the
most
unscrupulous
man
in
the
roman
empire
and
cicero
must
have
anticipated
the
fate
which
impended
over
him
if
antony
were
not
decreed
a
public
enemy
but
the
protests
of
the
orator
were
in
vain
he
lived
to
utter
them
as
a
witness
of
truth
and
nothing
was
left
to
him
but
to
die
of
course
antony
when
he
became
triumvir
when
he
made
a
bargain
that
he
never
meant
to
keep
with
octavius
and
lepidus
for
a
division
of
the
empire
between
them
would
not
spare
such
an
enemy
as
cicero
the
patriot
fled
mechanically
with
a
vacillating
mind
when
his
proscription
became
known
to
him
now
more
ready
to
die
than
live
since
all
hope
in
his
country
liberties
was
utterly
crushed
perhaps
he
might
have
escaped
to
some
remote
corner
of
the
empire
but
he
did
not
wish
for
life
any
more
than
did
socrates
when
summoned
before
his
judges
desponding
uncertain
pursued
he
met
his
fate
with
the
heroism
of
an
ancient
philosopher
he
surrendered
his
wearied
and
exhausted
body
to
the
hand
of
the
executioner
and
his
lofty
soul
to
the
keeping
of
that
personal
and
supreme
god
in
whom
he
believed
as
firmly
as
any
man
perhaps
of
pagan
antiquity
and
surely
of
him
more
than
of
any
other
roman
could
it
be
said
as
sir
walter
scott
said
of
pitt
and
as
gladstone
quoted
and
applied
to
sir
robert
peel
now
is
the
stately
column
broke
the
is
quenched
in
smoke
the
trumpet
silver
voice
is
still
the
warder
silent
on
the
hill
with
the
death
so
sad
of
the
most
illustrious
of
the
romans
whose
fame
was
not
earned
on
the
battlefield
i
should
perhaps
close
my
lecture
yet
it
would
be
incomplete
without
a
short
notice
of
those
services
which
as
statesman
orator
and
essayist
he
rendered
to
his
country
and
to
future
ages
and
nations
in
regard
to
his
services
as
a
statesman
they
were
rendered
chiefly
to
his
day
and
generation
for
he
elaborated
no
system
of
political
wisdom
like
burke
which
bears
except
casually
and
indirectly
on
modern
governments
and
institutions
it
was
his
aim
as
a
statesman
to
continue
the
roman
constitution
and
keep
the
people
from
civil
war
nor
does
he
seem
to
have
held
like
rousseau
the
as
the
voice
of
god
he
could
find
no
language
sufficiently
strong
to
express
his
abhorrence
of
those
who
led
the
people
for
their
own
individual
advancement
he
was
equally
severe
on
corrupt
governors
and
venal
judges
he
upheld
morality
and
justice
as
the
only
guides
in
public
affairs
he
loved
popularity
but
he
loved
his
country
better
he
hated
anarchy
as
much
as
did
burke
like
bright
he
looked
upon
civil
war
as
the
greatest
of
national
calamities
he
advocated
the
most
enlightened
views
based
on
the
principles
of
immutable
justice
he
wished
to
preserve
his
country
equally
from
unscrupulous
generals
and
unprincipled
politicians
as
for
his
orations
they
also
were
chiefly
designed
for
his
own
contemporaries
they
are
not
particularly
valuable
to
us
except
as
models
of
rhetorical
composition
and
transcendent
beauty
and
grace
of
style
they
are
not
so
luminous
with
fundamental
principles
as
they
are
vivid
with
invective
sarcasm
wit
and
telling
exaggeration
sometimes
persuasive
and
working
on
the
sensibilities
and
at
other
times
full
of
withering
scorn
they
are
more
like
the
pleadings
of
an
advocate
than
an
appeal
to
universal
reason
he
lays
down
no
laws
of
political
philosophy
nor
does
he
soar
into
the
region
of
abstract
truth
evolving
great
deductions
in
morals
but
as
an
orator
he
was
transcendently
effective
like
demosthenes
though
not
equal
to
the
greek
in
force
his
sentences
are
perhaps
too
involved
for
our
taste
yet
he
always
swayed
an
audience
whether
the
people
from
the
rostrum
or
the
judges
at
the
bar
or
the
senators
in
the
curia
he
seldom
lost
a
case
no
one
could
contend
with
him
successfully
he
called
out
the
admiration
of
critics
and
even
of
actors
he
had
a
wonderful
electrical
influence
his
very
tones
and
gestures
carried
everything
before
him
his
action
was
superb
and
his
whole
frame
quivered
from
real
or
affected
emotion
like
edward
everett
in
his
happiest
efforts
he
was
vehement
in
gesture
like
brougham
and
mirabeau
he
was
intensely
earnest
and
impressive
like
savonarola
he
had
exceeding
tact
and
was
master
of
the
passions
of
his
audience
there
was
an
irresistible
music
in
his
tones
of
voice
like
that
of
bernard
when
he
fanned
crusades
he
was
withering
in
his
denunciations
like
wendell
phillips
whom
in
person
he
somewhat
resembled
he
was
a
fascination
like
pericles
and
the
people
could
not
long
spare
him
from
the
excitement
he
produced
it
was
their
desire
to
hear
him
speak
which
had
no
small
share
in
producing
his
recall
from
banishment
they
crowded
around
him
as
the
people
did
around
chrysostom
in
antioch
he
amused
like
an
actor
and
instructed
like
a
sage
his
sentences
are
not
short
terse
epigrammatic
and
direct
but
elaborate
and
artificial
yet
with
all
his
arts
of
eloquence
his
soul
fired
with
great
sentiments
rose
in
its
inspired
fervor
above
even
the
melody
of
voice
the
rhythm
of
language
and
the
vehemence
of
action
a
listener
who
was
not
a
critic
might
fancy
it
was
gesture
voice
and
language
combined
but
after
all
it
was
the
communicating
his
soul
to
those
who
hung
upon
his
lips
and
securing
conviction
by
his
sincerity
and
appeals
to
conscience
he
must
have
had
a
natural
gift
for
oratory
aside
from
his
learning
and
accomplishments
and
rhetorical
arts
a
talent
very
rare
and
approaching
to
creative
genius
but
to
his
natural
gifts
like
luther
or
henry
clay
born
an
orator
he
added
marvellous
attainments
he
had
a
most
retentive
memory
he
was
versed
in
the
whole
history
of
the
world
he
was
always
ready
with
apt
illustrations
which
gave
interest
and
finish
to
his
discourses
he
was
the
most
industrious
and
studious
man
of
his
age
his
attainments
were
prodigious
he
was
master
of
all
the
knowledge
then
known
like
gladstone
of
our
day
he
was
not
so
learned
a
man
as
varro
but
varro
works
have
perished
as
the
great
monuments
of
german
scholars
are
perhaps
destined
to
perish
for
lack
of
style
cicero
style
embalmed
his
thoughts
and
made
them
imperishable
no
writer
is
immortal
who
is
not
an
artist
cicero
was
a
consummate
artist
and
studied
the
arrangement
of
sentences
like
the
historian
tacitus
and
the
grecian
thucydides
but
greater
than
as
an
artist
was
he
in
the
loftiness
of
his
mind
he
appealed
to
what
is
noblest
in
the
soul
transcendent
eloquence
ever
raises
mortals
to
the
skies
and
never
pulls
angels
down
love
of
country
love
of
home
love
of
friends
love
of
nature
love
of
law
love
of
god
is
brought
out
in
all
his
discourses
exalting
the
noblest
sentiments
which
move
the
human
soul
he
was
the
first
to
give
to
the
latin
language
beauty
and
artistic
finish
he
added
to
its
richness
copiousness
and
strength
he
gave
it
music
for
style
alone
he
would
be
valued
as
one
of
the
immortal
classics
all
men
of
culture
have
admired
it
from
augustine
to
bossuet
and
acknowledged
their
obligations
to
him
we
accord
to
the
great
poets
the
formation
of
languages
homer
dante
chaucer
shakspeare
but
i
doubt
if
either
virgil
or
horace
contributed
to
the
formation
of
the
latin
language
more
than
cicero
certainly
they
have
not
been
more
studied
and
admired
in
every
succeeding
age
the
orations
of
cicero
have
been
one
of
the
first
books
which
have
been
used
as
textbooks
in
colleges
is
it
not
something
to
have
been
one
of
the
acknowledged
masters
of
human
composition
what
a
great
service
did
cicero
render
to
the
education
of
the
teutonic
races
whatever
the
latin
language
has
done
for
the
modern
world
cicero
comes
in
for
a
large
share
of
the
glory
more
is
preserved
of
his
writings
than
of
any
other
writer
of
antiquity
but
not
for
style
alone
seen
equally
in
his
essays
and
in
his
orations
is
he
admirable
his
most
enduring
claim
on
the
gratitude
of
the
world
is
the
noble
tribute
he
rendered
to
those
truths
which
save
the
world
his
testimony
considering
he
was
a
pagan
is
remarkable
in
reference
to
what
is
sound
in
philosophy
and
morals
his
learning
too
is
seen
to
most
advantage
in
his
ethical
and
philosophical
writings
it
is
true
he
did
not
originate
like
socrates
and
plato
but
he
condensed
and
sifted
the
writings
of
the
greeks
and
is
the
best
expounder
of
their
philosophy
who
has
added
substantially
to
what
the
greeks
worked
out
of
their
creative
brain
i
know
that
no
roman
ever
added
to
the
domain
of
speculative
thought
yet
what
roman
ever
showed
such
a
comprehension
and
appreciation
of
greek
philosophy
as
did
cicero
he
was
profoundly
versed
in
all
the
learning
the
grecians
ever
taught
like
socrates
he
had
a
contempt
for
physical
science
because
science
in
his
day
was
based
on
imperfect
inductions
there
were
not
facts
enough
known
of
the
material
world
to
construct
sound
theories
physical
science
at
that
time
was
the
most
uncertain
of
all
knowledge
although
there
were
great
pretenders
then
as
now
who
maintained
it
was
the
only
certainty
but
the
speculations
of
scientists
disgusted
him
for
he
saw
nothing
in
them
upon
which
to
base
incontrovertible
truth
they
were
mere
dreams
and
baseless
theories
on
the
origin
of
the
universe
they
were
even
puerile
and
they
were
then
as
now
atheistic
in
their
tendency
they
mocked
the
consciousness
of
mankind
they
annihilated
faith
and
providence
at
best
they
made
all
things
subject
to
necessity
to
an
immutable
fate
not
to
an
intelligent
and
creator
but
cicero
like
socrates
believed
in
god
and
in
providential
interference
in
striking
contrast
with
caesar
who
believed
nothing
he
taught
moral
obligation
on
the
basis
of
accountability
to
god
he
repudiated
expediency
as
the
guide
in
life
and
fell
back
on
the
principles
of
eternal
right
as
an
ethical
writer
he
was
profounder
and
more
enlightened
than
paley
he
did
not
seek
to
overturn
the
popular
religion
like
grecian
sophists
only
like
socrates
to
overturn
ignorance
before
a
sound
foundation
could
be
laid
for
any
system
of
truth
nor
did
he
ridicule
religion
as
lucian
did
in
but
soared
to
comprehend
it
like
the
esoteric
priests
of
egypt
in
the
time
of
moses
or
pythagoras
he
cherished
as
lofty
views
of
god
and
his
moral
government
as
any
moralist
of
antiquity
and
all
these
lofty
views
he
taught
in
matchless
language
principles
of
government
principles
of
law
of
ethics
of
theology
giving
consolation
not
only
to
the
men
of
his
day
but
to
christian
sages
in
and
there
is
nothing
puerile
or
dreamy
or
demoralizing
in
his
teachings
they
all
are
luminous
for
learning
as
well
as
genius
he
rivalled
bacon
in
the
variety
and
profundity
of
his
attainments
he
gloried
in
the
certitudes
which
consciousness
reveals
as
well
as
in
the
facts
which
experience
and
history
demonstrate
with
these
he
consoled
himself
in
trouble
on
these
he
reposed
in
the
hour
of
danger
like
pascal
he
meditated
on
the
highest
truths
which
task
the
intellect
of
man
but
unlike
him
did
not
disdain
those
weapons
which
forged
and
which
no
one
used
more
triumphantly
than
pascal
himself
and
these
great
meditations
he
transmitted
for
all
ages
to
ponder
as
among
the
most
precious
of
the
legacies
of
antiquity
thus
did
he
live
a
shining
light
in
a
corrupt
and
godless
age
in
spite
of
all
the
faults
which
modern
critics
have
enlarged
upon
in
their
ambitious
desire
for
novelties
or
in
their
thoughtless
or
malignant
desire
to
show
up
human
frailties
he
was
a
patriot
taking
the
side
of
his
country
highest
interests
a
statesman
seeking
to
conserve
the
wisdom
of
his
ancestors
an
orator
exposing
vices
and
defending
the
innocent
a
philosopher
unfolding
the
wisdom
of
the
greeks
a
moralist
laying
down
the
principles
of
immutable
justice
a
sage
pondering
the
mysteries
of
life
ever
active
studious
dignified
the
charm
and
fascination
of
cultivated
circles
as
courteous
and
polished
as
the
ornaments
of
modern
society
revered
by
friends
feared
by
enemies
adored
by
all
good
people
a
kind
father
an
indulgent
husband
a
generous
friend
hospitable
witty
magnificent
a
most
accomplished
gentleman
one
of
the
best
men
of
all
antiquity
what
if
he
was
vain
and
egotistical
and
vacillating
and
occasionally
weak
can
you
expect
perfection
in
him
who
is
born
of
a
woman
we
palliate
the
backslidings
of
christians
we
excuse
the
crimes
of
a
constantine
a
theodosius
a
cromwell
shall
we
have
no
toleration
for
the
frailties
of
a
pagan
in
one
of
the
worst
periods
of
history
i
have
no
patience
with
those
critics
who
would
hurl
him
from
the
pedestal
on
which
he
has
stood
for
two
thousand
years
contrast
him
with
other
illustrious
men
how
few
romans
or
greeks
were
better
than
he
how
few
have
rendered
such
exalted
services
and
even
if
he
has
not
perpetuated
a
faultless
character
he
has
yet
bequeathed
a
noble
example
and
more
has
transmitted
a
legacy
in
the
richness
of
which
we
forget
the
faults
of
the
testator
a
legacy
of
imperishable
thought
clothed
in
the
language
of
imperishable
art
a
legacy
so
valuable
that
it
is
the
treasured
inheritance
of
all

which
no

the

of

it
is
my
object
in
this
lecture
to
present
the
condition
of
woman
under
the
influences
of
paganism
before
christianity
enfranchised
and
elevated
her
as
a
type
of
the
pagan
woman
i
select
cleopatra
partly
because
she
was
famous
and
partly
because
she
possessed
traits
and
accomplishments
which
made
her
interesting
in
spite
of
the
vices
which
degraded
her
she
was
a
queen
the
heir
of
a
long
line
of
kings
and
ruled
over
an
ancient
and
highly
civilized
country
she
was
intellectual
accomplished
beautiful
and
fascinating
she
lived
in
one
of
the
most
interesting
capitals
of
the
ancient
world
and
by
birth
she
was
more
greek
than
she
was
african
or
oriental
she
lived
too
in
a
great
age
when
rome
had
nearly
conquered
the
world
when
roman
senators
and
generals
had
more
power
than
kings
when
grecian
arts
and
literature
were
copied
by
the
imperial
romans
when
the
rich
and
fortunate
were
luxurious
and
ostentatious
beyond
all
precedent
when
life
had
reached
the
highest
point
of
material
splendor
and
yet
when
luxury
had
not
destroyed
military
virtues
or
undermined
the
strength
of
the
empire
the
eternal
city
then
numbered
millions
of
people
and
was
the
grandest
capital
ever
seen
on
this
earth
since
everything
was
there
concentrated
the
spoils
of
the
world
riches
immeasurable
literature
and
art
palaces
and
temples
power
unlimited
the
proudest
centre
of
civilization
which
then
existed
and
a
civilization
which
in
its
material
aspects
has
not
since
been
surpassed
the
civilized
world
was
then
most
emphatically
pagan
in
both
spirit
and
forms
religion
as
a
controlling
influence
was
dead
only
a
very
few
among
speculative
philosophers
believed
in
any
god
except
in
a
degrading
sense
as
a
blind
inexorable
fate
or
an
impersonation
of
the
powers
of
nature
the
future
state
was
a
most
perplexing
uncertainty
epicurean
and
material
prosperity
were
regarded
as
the
greatest
good
and
as
doubt
of
the
darkest
kind
hung
over
the
future
the
body
was
necessarily
regarded
as
of
more
value
than
the
soul
in
fact
it
was
only
the
body
which
paganism
recognized
as
a
reality
the
soul
god
and
immortality
were
virtually
everywhere
ignored
it
was
in
this
godless
yet
brilliant
age
that
cleopatra
appears
upon
the
stage
having
been
born
years
before
christ
about
a
century
before
the
new
revolutionary
religion
was
proclaimed
in
judea
her
father
was
a
ptolemy
and
she
succeeded
him
on
the
throne
of
egypt
when
quite
young
the
last
of
a
famous
dynasty
that
had
reigned
nearly
three
hundred
years
the
ptolemies
descended
from
one
of
generals
reigned
in
great
magnificence
at
alexandria
which
was
the
commercial
centre
of
the
world
whose
ships
whitened
the
mediterranean
that
great
inland
lake
as
it
were
in
the
centre
of
the
roman
empire
around
whose
shores
were
countless
cities
and
villas
and
works
of
art
alexandria
was
a
city
of
schools
of
libraries
and
museums
of
temples
and
of
palaces
as
well
as
a
mart
of
commerce
its
famous
library
was
the
largest
in
the
world
and
was
the
pride
of
the
age
and
of
the
empire
learned
men
from
all
countries
came
to
this
capital
to
study
science
philosophy
and
art
it
was
virtually
a
grecian
city
and
the
language
of
the
leading
people
was
greek
it
was
rivalled
in
provincial
magnificence
only
by
antioch
the
seat
of
the
old
syrian
civilization
also
a
greek
capital
so
far
as
the
governing
classes
could
make
it
one
greece
politically
ruined
still
sent
forth
those
influences
which
made
her
civilization
potent
in
every
land
cleopatra
the
last
of
the
line
of
grecian
sovereigns
in
egypt
was
essentially
greek
in
her
features
her
language
and
her
manners
there
was
nothing
african
about
her
as
we
understand
the
term
african
except
that
her
complexion
may
have
been
darkened
by
the
intermarriage
of
the
ptolemies
and
i
have
often
wondered
why
so
learned
and
classical
a
man
as
story
should
have
given
to
this
queen
in
his
famous
statue
such
thick
lips
and
african
features
which
no
more
marked
her
than
indian
features
mark
the
family
of
the
braganzas
on
the
throne
of
brazil
she
was
not
even
coptic
like
athanasius
and
saint
augustine
on
the
ancient
coins
and
medals
her
features
are
severely
classical
nor
is
it
probable
that
any
of
the
peculiarities
of
the
ancient
egyptian
kings
marked
the
dynasty
of
the
ptolemies
no
purely
egyptian
customs
lingered
in
the
palaces
of
alexandria
the
old
deities
of
isis
and
osiris
gave
place
to
the
worship
of
jupiter
minerva
and
venus
the
wonders
of
pristine
egypt
were
confined
to
memphis
and
thebes
and
the
dilapidated
cities
of
the
nile
the
mysteries
of
the
antique
egyptian
temples
were
no
more
known
to
the
learned
and
mercantile
citizen
of
alexandria
than
they
are
to
us
the
pyramids
were
as
much
a
wonder
then
as
now
the
priests
and
jugglers
alike
mingled
in
the
crowd
of
jews
syrians
romans
greeks
parthians
arabs
who
congregated
in
this
learned
and
mercantile
city
so
we
have
a
right
to
presume
that
cleopatra
when
she
first
appeared
upon
the
stage
of
history
as
a
girl
of
fourteen
was
simply
a
very
beautiful
and
accomplished
greek
princess
who
could
speak
several
languages
with
fluency
as
precocious
as
elizabeth
of
england
skilled
in
music
conversant
with
history
and
surrounded
with
eminent
masters
she
was
only
when
she
was
an
object
of
attraction
to
caesar
then
in
the
midst
of
his
triumphs
how
remarkable
must
have
been
her
fascinations
if
at
that
age
she
could
have
diverted
even
for
a
time
the
great
captain
from
his
conquests
and
chained
him
to
her
side
that
refined
intellectual
old
veteran
of
fifty
with
the
whole
world
at
his
feet
loaded
down
with
the
cares
of
government
as
temperate
as
he
was
ambitious
and
bent
on
new
conquests
would
not
have
been
chained
and
enthralled
by
a
girl
of
however
beautiful
had
she
not
been
as
remarkable
for
intellect
and
culture
as
she
was
for
beauty
nor
is
it
likely
that
cleopatra
would
have
devoted
herself
to
this
old
general
had
she
not
hoped
to
gain
something
from
him
besides
caresses
namely
the
confirmation
of
her
authority
as
queen
she
also
may
have
had
some
patriotic
motives
touching
the
political
independence
of
her
country
left
by
her
father
will
at
the
age
of
eighteen
joint
heir
of
the
egyptian
throne
with
her
brother
ptolemy
she
soon
found
herself
expelled
from
the
capital
by
him
and
the
leading
generals
of
the
army
because
they
did
not
relish
her
precocious
activity
in
government
her
gathered
adherents
had
made
but
little
advance
towards
regaining
her
rights
when
in
august
caesar
landed
in
pursuit
of
pompey
whom
he
had
defeated
at
pharsalia
pompey
assassination
left
caesar
free
and
he
proceeded
to
alexandria
to
establish
himself
for
the
winter
here
the
wily
and
beautiful
young
exile
sought
him
and
won
his
interest
and
his
affection
after
some
months
of
revelry
and
luxury
caesar
left
egypt
in
to
chastise
an
eastern
rebel
and
was
in
followed
to
rome
by
cleopatra
who
remained
there
in
splendid
state
until
the
assassination
of
caesar
drove
her
back
to
egypt
her
whole
subsequent
life
showed
her
to
be
as
cunning
and
politic
as
she
was
luxurious
and
possibly
she
may
have
loved
so
interesting
and
brilliant
a
man
as
the
great
caesar
aside
from
the
admiration
of
his
position
but
he
never
became
her
slave
although
it
was
believed
a
hundred
years
after
his
death
that
she
was
actually
living
in
his
house
when
he
was
assassinated
and
was
the
mother
of
his
son
caesarion
but
froude
doubts
this
and
the
probabilities
are
that
he
is
correct
for
like
macaulay
he
is
not
apt
to
be
wrong
in
facts
but
only
in
the
way
he
puts
them
cleopatra
was
years
of
age
when
she
first
met
antony
a
period
of
life
says
plutarch
when
woman
beauty
is
most
splendid
and
her
intellect
is
in
full
maturity
we
have
no
account
of
the
style
of
her
beauty
except
that
it
was
transcendent
absolutely
irresistible
with
such
a
variety
of
expression
as
to
be
called
infinite
as
already
remarked
from
the
long
residence
of
her
family
in
egypt
and
intermarriages
with
foreigners
her
complexion
may
have
been
darker
than
that
of
either
persians
or
greeks
it
probably
resembled
that
of
queen
esther
more
than
that
of
aspasia
in
that
dark
richness
and
voluptuousness
which
to
some
have
such
attractions
but
in
grace
and
vivacity
she
was
purely
grecian
not
like
a
blooming
eastern
bride
languid
and
passive
and
effeminate
but
bright
witty
and
intellectual
shakspeare
paints
her
as
full
of
lively
sallies
with
the
power
of
adapting
herself
to
circumstances
with
tact
and
good
nature
like
a
madame
récamier
or
a
maintenon
rather
than
like
a
montespan
or
a
pompadour
although
her
nature
was
passionate
her
manner
enticing
and
her
habits
luxurious
she
did
not
weary
or
satiate
like
a
mere
sensual
beauty
age
can
not
wither
her
nor
custom
stale
her
infinite
variety
she
certainly
had
the
power
of
retaining
the
conquests
she
had
won
which
rarely
happens
except
with
those
who
are
gifted
with
intellectual
radiance
and
freshness
she
held
her
hold
on
antony
for
eleven
years
when
he
was
burdened
with
great
public
cares
and
duties
and
when
he
was
years
of
age
such
a
superior
man
as
he
was
intellectually
and
after
caesar
the
leading
man
of
the
empire
a
statesman
as
well
as
soldier
would
not
have
been
enslaved
so
long
by
cleopatra
had
she
not
possessed
remarkable
gifts
and
attainments
like
those
famous
women
who
reigned
in
the
courts
of
the
bourbons
in
the
seventeenth
and
eighteenth
centuries
and
who
by
their
wit
and
social
fascinations
gathered
around
their
thrones
the
most
distinguished
men
of
france
and
made
them
friends
as
well
as
admirers
the
pompadours
of
the
world
have
only
a
brief
reign
and
at
last
become
repulsive
but
cleopatra
like
maintenon
was
always
attractive
although
she
could
not
lay
claim
to
the
virtues
of
the
latter
she
was
as
politic
as
the
french
beauty
and
as
full
of
expedients
to
please
her
lord
she
may
have
revelled
in
the
banquets
she
prepared
for
antony
as
esther
did
in
those
she
prepared
for
xerxes
but
with
the
same
intent
to
please
him
rather
than
herself
and
win
from
his
weakness
those
political
favors
which
in
his
calmer
hours
he
might
have
shrunk
from
granting
cleopatra
was
a
politician
as
well
as
a
luxurious
beauty
and
it
may
have
been
her
supreme
aim
to
secure
the
independence
of
egypt
she
wished
to
beguile
antony
as
she
had
sought
to
beguile
caesar
since
they
were
the
masters
of
the
world
and
had
it
in
their
power
to
crush
her
sovereignty
and
reduce
her
realm
to
a
mere
province
of
the
empire
nor
is
there
evidence
that
in
the
magnificent
banquets
she
gave
to
the
roman
general
she
ever
lost
her
she
drank
and
made
him
drink
but
retained
her
wits
laughing
him
out
of
patience
and
laughing
him
into
patience
ascendant
over
him
by
raillery
irony
and
wit
and
antony
again
although
fond
of
banquets
and
ostentation
like
other
roman
nobles
and
utterly
unscrupulous
and
unprincipled
as
roman
libertines
were
was
also
general
statesman
and
orator
he
grew
up
amid
the
dangers
and
toils
and
privations
of
caesar
camp
he
was
as
greedy
of
honors
as
was
his
imperial
master
he
was
a
sunburnt
and
experienced
commander
obliged
to
be
on
his
guard
and
ready
for
emergencies
no
such
man
feels
that
he
can
afford
to
indulge
his
appetites
except
on
rare
occasions
one
of
the
leading
peculiarities
of
all
great
generals
has
been
their
temperance
it
marked
caesar
charlemagne
gustavus
adolphus
frederic
the
great
cromwell
and
napoleon
when
alexander
gave
himself
up
to
banquets
his
conquests
ended
even
such
a
man
as
louis
xiv
always
maintained
the
decencies
of
society
amid
his
dissipated
courtiers
we
feel
that
a
man
who
could
discourse
so
eloquently
as
antony
did
over
the
dead
body
of
caesar
was
something
more
than
a
sensualist
or
a
demagogue
he
was
also
the
man
in
rome
reminding
the
people
it
is
said
of
the
busts
of
hercules
he
was
lavish
like
caesar
but
like
him
sought
popularity
and
cared
but
little
what
it
cost
it
is
probable
that
cicero
painted
him
in
his
famous
philippics
in
darker
colors
than
he
deserved
because
he
aimed
to
be
caesar
successor
as
he
probably
would
have
been
but
for
his
infatuation
for
cleopatra
caesar
sent
him
to
rome
as
master
of
the
horse
a
position
next
in
power
to
that
of
dictator
when
caesar
was
assassinated
antony
was
the
most
powerful
man
of
the
empire
he
was
greater
than
any
existing
king
he
was
almost
supreme
and
after
caesar
death
when
he
divided
his
sovereignty
of
the
world
with
octavius
and
lepidus
he
had
the
fairest
chance
of
becoming
imperator
he
had
great
military
experience
the
broad
orient
as
his
domain
and
half
the
legions
of
rome
under
his
control
it
was
when
this
great
man
was
triumvir
sharing
with
only
two
others
the
empire
of
the
world
and
likely
to
overpower
them
when
he
was
in
asia
consolidating
and
arranging
the
affairs
of
his
vast
department
that
he
met
the
woman
who
was
the
cause
of
all
his
calamities
he
was
then
in
cilicia
and
with
all
the
arrogance
of
a
roman
general
had
sent
for
the
queen
of
egypt
to
appear
before
him
and
answer
to
an
accusation
of
having
rendered
assistance
to
cassius
before
the
fatal
battle
of
philippi
he
had
already
known
and
admired
cleopatra
in
rome
and
it
is
not
improbable
that
she
divined
the
secret
of
his
judicial
summons
his
envoy
struck
with
her
beauty
and
intelligence
advised
her
to
appear
in
her
best
attire
such
a
woman
scarcely
needed
such
a
hint
so
making
every
preparation
for
her
journey
money
ornaments
gifts
a
kind
of
queen
of
sheba
a
zenobia
in
her
pride
and
glory
a
queen
esther
when
she
had
invited
the
king
and
his
minister
to
a
banquet
she
came
to
the
cydnus
and
ascended
the
river
in
a
magnificent
barge
such
as
had
never
been
seen
before
and
prepared
to
meet
her
judge
not
as
a
criminal
but
as
a
conqueror
armed
with
those
weapons
that
few
mortals
can
resist
the
barge
she
sat
in
like
a
burnish
throne
burn
on
the
water
the
poop
was
beaten
gold
purple
the
sails
and
so
perfumed
that
the
winds
were
with
them
the
oars
were
silver
which
to
the
tune
of
flutes
kept
stroke
and
made
the
water
which
they
beat
to
follow
faster
as
amorous
of
their
strokes
for
her
own
person
it
beggar
all
description
she
did
lie
in
her
pavilion
of
tissue
that
venus
where
we
see
the
fancy
outwork
nature
on
each
side
her
stood
pretty
dimpled
boys
like
smiling
cupids
with
fans
her
gentlewomen
like
the
nereides
so
many
mermaids
tended
her
i
the
eyes
at
the
helm
a
seeming
mermaid
steers
from
the
barge
a
strange
invisible
perfume
hits
the
sense
of
the
adjacent
wharves
the
city
cast
her
people
out
upon
her
and
antony
enthroned
i
the
did
sit
alone
whistling
to
th
air
which
but
for
vacancy
had
gone
to
gaze
on
cleopatra
too
and
made
a
gap
in
nature
on
the
arrival
of
this
siren
queen
antony
had
invited
her
to
supper
the
dinner
of
the
romans
but
she
with
woman
instinct
had
declined
till
he
should
come
to
her
and
he
with
the
urbanity
of
a
polished
noble
for
such
he
probably
was
complied
and
found
a
banquet
which
astonished
even
him
accustomed
as
he
was
to
senatorial
magnificence
and
which
with
all
the
treasures
of
the
east
he
could
not
rival
from
that
fatal
hour
he
was
enslaved
she
conquered
him
not
merely
by
her
display
and
her
dazzling
beauty
but
by
her
wit
her
very
tones
were
music
so
accomplished
was
she
in
languages
that
without
interpreters
she
conversed
not
only
with
greeks
and
latins
but
with
ethiopians
jews
arabians
syrians
medes
and
parthians
so
dazzled
and
bewitched
was
antony
that
instead
of
continuing
the
duties
of
his
great
position
he
returned
with
cleopatra
to
alexandria
there
to
keep
holiday
and
squander
riches
and
still
worse
his
precious
time
to
the
shame
and
scandal
of
rome
inglorious
and
without
excuse
a
samson
at
the
feet
of
delilah
or
a
hercules
throwing
away
his
club
to
seize
the
distaff
of
omphale
confessing
to
the
potency
of
that
mysterious
charm
which
the
sage
at
the
court
of
an
eastern
prince
pronounced
the
strongest
power
on
earth
never
was
a
strong
man
more
enthralled
than
was
antony
by
this
bewitching
woman
who
exhausted
every
art
to
please
him
she
played
at
dice
with
him
drank
with
him
hunted
with
him
rambled
with
him
jested
with
him
angled
with
him
flattering
and
reproving
him
by
turn
always
having
some
new
device
of
pleasure
to
gratify
his
senses
or
stimulate
his
curiosity
thus
passed
the
winter
of
and
in
the
spring
he
was
recalled
to
borne
by
political
dissensions
there
at
this
stage
however
it
would
seem
that
ambition
was
paramount
with
him
not
love
for
his
wife
fulvia
having
died
he
did
not
marry
cleopatra
but
octavia
sister
of
octavius
his
and
general
rival
it
was
evidently
from
political
considerations
that
he
married
octavia
who
was
a
stately
and
noble
woman
but
tedious
in
her
dignity
and
unattractive
in
her
person
and
what
a
commentary
on
roman
rank
the
sister
of
a
roman
grandee
seemed
to
the
ambitious
general
a
greater
match
than
the
queen
of
egypt
how
this
must
have
piqued
the
proud
daughter
of
the
ptolemies
that
she
a
queen
with
all
her
charms
was
not
the
equal
in
the
eyes
of
antony
to
the
sister
of
caesar
heir
but
she
knew
her
power
and
stifled
her
resentment
and
waited
for
her
time
she
too
had
a
political
end
to
gain
and
was
too
politic
to
give
way
to
anger
and
reproaches
she
was
anything
but
the
impulsive
woman
that
some
suppose
but
a
great
actress
and
artist
as
some
women
are
when
they
would
conquer
even
in
their
loves
which
if
they
do
not
feign
at
least
they
know
how
to
make
appear
greater
than
they
are
for
about
three
years
antony
cut
loose
from
cleopatra
and
pursued
his
military
career
in
the
east
as
the
rival
of
octavius
might
having
in
view
the
sovereignty
that
caesar
had
bequeathed
to
the
strongest
man
but
his
passion
for
cleopatra
could
not
long
be
suppressed
neither
from
reasons
of
state
nor
from
the
respect
he
must
have
felt
for
the
admirable
conduct
of
octavia
who
was
devoted
to
him
and
who
was
one
of
the
most
magnanimous
and
reproachless
women
of
antiquity
and
surely
he
must
have
had
some
great
qualities
to
call
out
the
love
of
the
noblest
and
proudest
woman
of
the
age
in
spite
of
his
many
vices
and
his
abandonment
to
a
mad
passion
forgetful
alike
both
of
fame
and
duty
he
had
not
been
two
years
in
athens
the
headquarters
of
his
eastern
department
before
he
was
called
upon
to
chastise
the
parthians
who
had
thrown
off
the
roman
yoke
and
invaded
other
roman
provinces
but
hardly
had
he
left
octavia
and
set
foot
again
in
asia
before
he
sent
for
his
egyptian
mistress
and
loaded
her
with
presents
not
gold
and
silver
and
precious
stones
and
silks
and
curious
works
of
art
merely
but
whole
provinces
even
phoenicia
syria
cilicia
and
a
part
of
judea
and
arabia
provinces
which
belonged
not
to
him
but
to
the
roman
empire
how
indignant
must
have
been
the
roman
people
when
they
heard
of
such
lavish
presents
and
presents
which
he
had
no
right
to
give
and
when
the
artful
cleopatra
feigned
illness
on
the
approach
of
octavia
pretending
to
be
dying
of
love
and
wasting
her
body
by
fasting
and
weeping
by
turns
and
perhaps
tearing
her
hair
in
a
seeming
paroxysm
of
grief
for
an
actress
can
do
even
this
antony
was
totally
disarmed
and
gave
up
his
parthian
expedition
altogether
which
was
treason
to
the
state
and
returned
to
alexandria
more
submissive
than
ever
this
abandonment
of
duty
and
official
trust
disgusted
and
incensed
the
romans
so
that
his
cause
was
weakened
octavius
became
stronger
every
day
and
now
resolved
on
reigning
alone
this
meant
another
civil
war
how
strong
the
party
of
antony
must
have
been
to
keep
together
and
sustain
him
amid
such
scandals
treasons
and
disgrace
antony
perceiving
a
desperate
contest
before
him
ending
in
his
supremacy
or
ruin
put
forth
all
his
energies
assisted
by
the
contributions
of
cleopatra
who
furnished
two
hundred
ships
and
twenty
thousand
talents
about
twenty
million
dollars
he
had
five
hundred
beside
galleys
one
hundred
thousand
foot
and
twelve
thousand
horse
one
of
the
largest
armies
that
any
roman
general
had
ever
commanded
and
he
was
attended
by
vassal
kings
from
the
east
the
forces
of
octavius
were
not
so
large
though
better
disciplined
nor
was
he
a
match
for
antony
in
military
experience
antony
with
his
superior
forces
wished
to
fight
upon
the
land
but
against
his
better
judgment
was
overruled
by
cleopatra
who
having
reinforced
him
with
sixty
galleys
urged
him
to
contend
upon
the
sea
the
rivals
met
at
actium
where
was
fought
one
of
the
great
decisive
battles
of
the
world
for
a
while
the
fortunes
of
the
day
were
doubtful
when
cleopatra
from
some
unexplained
motive
or
from
panic
or
possibly
from
a
calculating
policy
was
seen
sailing
away
with
her
ships
for
egypt
and
what
was
still
more
extraordinary
antony
abandoned
his
fleet
and
followed
her
had
he
been
defeated
on
the
sea
he
still
had
superior
forces
on
the
land
and
was
a
match
for
octavius
his
infatuation
ended
in
a
weakness
difficult
to
comprehend
in
a
successful
roman
general
and
never
was
infatuation
followed
by
more
tragic
consequences
was
this
madness
sent
upon
him
by
that
awful
power
who
controls
the
fate
of
war
and
the
destinies
of
nations
who
sent
madness
upon
nebuchadnezzar
who
blinded
napoleon
at
the
very
summit
of
his
greatness
may
not
that
memorable
defeat
have
been
ordered
by
providence
to
give
consolidation
and
peace
and
prosperity
to
the
roman
empire
so
long
groaning
under
the
complicated
miseries
of
anarchy
and
civil
war
if
an
imperial
government
was
necessary
for
the
existing
political
and
social
condition
of
the
roman
world
and
this
is
maintained
by
most
historians
how
fortunate
it
was
that
the
empire
fell
into
the
hands
of
a
man
whose
subsequent
policy
was
peace
the
development
of
resources
of
nations
and
a
vigorous
administration
of
government
it
is
generally
conceded
that
the
reign
of
octavius
or
as
he
is
more
generally
known
augustus
caesar
was
able
enlightened
and
efficient
he
laid
down
the
policy
which
succeeding
emperors
pursued
and
which
resulted
in
the
peace
and
prosperity
of
the
roman
world
until
vices
prepared
the
way
for
violence
augustus
was
a
great
organizer
and
the
machinery
of
government
which
he
and
his
ministers
perfected
kept
the
empire
together
until
it
was
overrun
by
the
new
germanic
races
had
antony
conquered
at
actium
the
destinies
of
the
empire
might
have
been
far
different
but
for
two
hundred
years
the
world
never
saw
a
more
efficient
central
power
than
that
exercised
by
the
roman
emperors
or
by
their
ministers
imperialism
at
last
proved
fatal
to
genius
and
the
higher
interests
of
mankind
but
imperialism
was
the
creation
of
julius
caesar
as
a
real
or
supposed
necessity
it
was
efficiently
and
beneficently
continued
by
his
augustus
and
its
consolidated
strength
became
an
established
institution
which
the
civilized
world
quietly
accepted
the
battle
of
actium
virtually
settled
the
civil
war
and
the
fortunes
of
antony
although
he
afterwards
fought
bravely
and
energetically
but
all
to
no
purpose
and
then
at
last
his
eyes
were
opened
and
shakspeare
makes
him
bitterly
exclaim
all
is
lost
this
foul
egyptian
hath
betrayed
me
betray
i
am
o
this
false
soul
of
egypt
and
with
his
ruin
the
ruin
of
his
paramour
was
also
settled
yet
her
resources
were
not
utterly
exhausted
she
retired
into
a
castle
or
mausoleum
she
had
prepared
for
herself
in
case
of
necessity
with
her
most
valuable
treasures
and
sent
messengers
to
antony
who
reported
to
him
that
she
was
dead
that
she
had
killed
herself
in
despair
he
believed
it
all
his
wrath
now
vanished
in
his
grief
he
could
not
live
or
did
not
wish
to
live
without
her
and
he
fell
upon
his
own
sword
the
wound
was
mortal
but
death
did
not
immediately
follow
he
lived
to
learn
that
cleopatra
had
again
deceived
him
that
she
was
still
alive
even
amid
the
agonies
of
the
shadow
of
death
and
in
view
of
this
last
fatal
lie
of
hers
he
did
not
upbraid
her
but
ordered
his
servants
to
bear
him
to
her
retreat
covered
with
blood
the
dying
general
was
drawn
up
by
ropes
and
through
a
window
the
only
entrance
to
the
retreat
that
was
left
unbarred
into
her
presence
and
soon
expired
shakspeare
has
antony
greet
cleopatra
with
the
words
i
am
dying
egypt
dying
this
suggestive
theme
has
been
enlarged
in
a
modern
song
of
pathetic
eloquence
i
am
dying
egypt
dying
ebbs
the
crimson
fast
and
the
dark
plutonian
shadows
gather
on
the
evening

let
thine

enfold
me
hush
thy
sobs
and
bow
thine
ear
listen
to
the
great
and
thou
must
hear
should
the
base
plebeian
rabble
dare
assail
my
name
at

where
my
noble

circling
wings
that
her

with

for

egyptian
glorious
sorceress
of

the

ah
no

shall
my

exulting
swell

guard
thee
cleopatra
rome
farewell
thus
perished
the
great
triumvir
dying
like
a
roman
whose
blinded
but
persistent
love
whatever
were
its
elements
ever
shall
make
his
name
memorable
all
the
ages
will
point
to
him
as
a
man
who
gave
the
world
away
for
the
caresses
of
a
woman
and
a
woman
who
deceived
and
ruined
him
as
for
her
this
selfish
heartless
sorceress
gifted
and
beautiful
as
she
was
what
does
she
do
when
she
sees
her
lover
dead
dying
for
her
does
she
share
his
fate
not
she
what
selfish
woman
ever
killed
herself
for
love
some
natural
tears
she
shed
but
wiped
them
soon
she
may
have
torn
her
clothes
and
beaten
her
breast
and
disfigured
her
face
and
given
vent
to
mourning
and
lamentations
but
she
does
not
seek
death
nor
surrender
herself
to
grief
nor
court
despair
she
renews
her
strength
she
reserves
her
arts
for
another
victim
she
hopes
to
win
octavius
as
she
had
won
julius
and
antony
for
she
was
only
and
still
a
queen
and
for
what
that
she
might
retain
her
own
sovereignty
or
the
independence
of
egypt
still
the
most
fertile
of
countries
rich
splendid
and
with
grand
traditions
which
went
back
thousands
of
years
the
oldest
and
once
the
most
powerful
of
monarchies
love
was
ever
subservient
to
her
interests
antony
gave
up
ambition
for
love
whatever
that
love
was
it
took
possession
of
his
whole
being
not
pure
and
tender
but
powerful
strange
doubtless
a
mad
infatuation
and
perhaps
something
more
since
it
never
passed
away
admiration
allied
with
desire
the
worship
of
dazzling
gifts
though
not
of
moral
virtues
would
such
a
love
have
been
permanent
probably
not
since
the
object
of
it
did
not
shine
in
the
beauty
of
the
soul
but
rather
in
the
graces
and
adornments
of
the
body
intensified
indeed
by
the
lustre
of
bewitching
social
qualities
and
the
brightness
of
a
cultivated
intellect
it
is
hard
to
analyze
a
passionate
love
between
highly
gifted
people
who
have
an
intense
development
of
both
the
higher
and
the
lower
natures
and
still
more
difficult
when
the
idol
is
a
venus
polyhymnia
rather
than
a
venus
urania
but
the
love
of
antony
whether
unwise
or
mysterious
or
unfortunate
was
not
feigned
or
forced
it
was
real
and
it
was
irresistible
he
could
not
help
it
he
was
enslaved
bound
hand
and
foot
his
reason
may
have
rallied
to
his
support
but
his
will
was
fettered
he
may
have
had
at
times
dark
and
gloomy
suspicions
that
he
was
played
with
that
he
was
cheated
that
he
would
be
deserted
that
cleopatra
was
false
and
treacherous
and
yet
she
reigned
over
him
he
could
not
live
without
her
she
was
all
in
all
to
him
so
long
as
the
infatuation
lasted
and
it
had
lasted
fourteen
years
with
increasing
force
in
spite
of
duty
and
pressing
labors
the
calls
of
ambition
and
the
lust
of
power
in
this
consuming
and
abandoned
passion
for
fourteen
years
so
strange
and
inglorious
and
for
a
woman
so
unworthy
even
if
he
were
no
better
than
she
we
see
one
of
the
great
mysteries
of
our
complex
nature
not
uncommon
but
insoluble
i
have
no
respect
for
antony
and
but
little
admiration
i
speak
of
such
mad
infatuation
as
a
humiliating
exhibition
of
human
weakness
any
one
under
its
fearful
spell
is
an
object
of
pity
but
i
have
more
sympathy
for
him
than
for
cleopatra
although
she
was
doubtless
a
very
gifted
woman
he
was
her
victim
she
was
not
his
if
extravagant
and
reckless
and
sensual
he
was
frank
generous
eloquent
brave
and
true
to
her
she
was
artful
designing
and
selfish
and
used
him
for
her
own
ends
although
we
do
not
know
that
she
was
perfidious
and
false
to
him
but
for
her
he
would
have
ruled
the
world
he
showed
himself
capable
of
an
enormous
sacrifice
she
made
no
sacrifices
for
him
she
could
even
have
transferred
her
affections
since
she
afterwards
sought
to
play
her
blandishments
upon
his
rival
conceive
of
antony
if
you
can
as
loving
any
one
else
than
her
who
led
him
on
to
ruin
in
the
very
degradation
of
love
we
see
its
sacredness
in
his
fidelity
we
find
some
palliation
nor
does
it
seem
that
octavia
the
slighted
wife
of
antony
gave
way
to
vengeance
her
sense
of
injury
was
overshadowed
by
her
pity
this
lofty
and
dignified
matron
even
took
his
six
surviving
children
three
of
whom
were
cleopatra
and
brought
them
up
in
her
own
house
as
her
own
can
paganism
show
a
greater
magnanimity
the
fate
of
cleopatra
was
tragic
also
she
too
destroyed
herself
not
probably
by
the
bite
of
asps
as
is
the
popular
opinion
but
by
some
potent
and
subtile
poison
that
she
ever
carried
with
her
and
which
had
the
effect
of
benumbing
the
body
and
making
her
insensible
to
pain
yet
she
does
not
kill
herself
because
she
can
not
survive
the
death
of
antony
but
because
she
is
too
proud
to
be
carried
to
rome
to
grace
the
triumph
of
the
new
caesar
she
will
not
be
led
a
captive
princess
up
the
capitoline
hill
she
has
an
overbearing
pride
know
sir
says
she
to
proculeius
that
i
will
not
wait
pinion
at
your
master
court
nor
once
be
chastis
with
the
sober
eye
of
dull
octavia
rather
a
ditch
in
egypt
be
gentle
grave
to
me
but
whether
pride
or
whether
shame
was
the
more
powerful
motive
in
committing
suicide
i
do
not
read
that
she
was
a
victim
of
remorse
she
had
no
moral
sense
nor
did
she
give
way
to
sentimental
grief
on
the
death
of
antony
her
grief
was
blended
with
disappointment
and
rage
nor
did
she
hide
her
head
but
wore
a
face
of
brass
she
used
all
her
arts
to
win
octavius
her
resources
did
not
fail
her
but
she
expended
them
on
one
of
the
coldest
most
politic
and
most
astute
men
that
ever
lived
and
the
disappointment
that
followed
her
defeat
that
she
could
not
enslave
another
conqueror
was
greater
than
the
grief
for
antony
nor
during
her
whole
career
do
we
see
any
signs
of
that
sorrow
and
humility
which
it
would
seem
should
mark
a
woman
who
has
made
so
great
and
fatal
a
mistake
cut
off
hopelessly
from
the
respect
of
the
world
and
the
peace
of
her
own
soul
we
see
grief
rage
despair
in
her
miserable
end
as
we
see
pride
and
shamefacedness
in
her
gilded
life
but
not
remorse
or
shame
and
when
she
dies
by
her
own
hand
it
is
not
in
madness
but
to
escape
humiliation
suicide
was
one
of
the
worst
features
of
pagan
antiquity
it
was
a
base
and
cowardly
reluctance
to
meet
the
evils
of
life
as
much
as
indifference
to
the
future
and
a
blunted
moral
sense
so
much
for
the
woman
herself
her
selfish
spirit
her
vile
career
but
as
cleopatra
is
one
of
the
best
known
and
most
striking
examples
of
a
pagan
woman
with
qualities
and
in
circumstances
peculiarly
characteristic
of
paganism
i
must
make
a
few
remarks
on
these
points
one
of
the
most
noticeable
of
these
is
that
immorality
seems
to
have
been
no
bar
to
social
position
some
of
those
who
were
most
attractive
and
sought
after
were
notoriously
immoral
aspasia
whom
socrates
and
pericles
equally
admired
and
whose
house
was
the
resort
of
poets
philosophers
statesmen
and
artists
and
who
is
said
to
have
been
one
of
the
most
cultivated
women
of
antiquity
bore
a
sullied
name
sappho
who
was
ever
exalted
by
grecian
poets
for
the
sweetness
of
her
verses
attempted
to
reconcile
a
life
of
pleasure
with
a
life
of
letters
and
threw
herself
into
the
sea
because
of
a
disappointed
passion
lais
a
professional
courtesan
was
the
associate
of
kings
and
sages
as
well
as
the
idol
of
poets
and
priests
agrippina
whose
very
name
is
infamy
was
the
admiration
of
courtiers
and
statesmen
lucilla
who
armed
her
assassins
against
her
own
brother
seems
to
have
ruled
the
court
of
marcus
aurelius
and
all
these
women
and
more
who
could
be
mentioned
were
like
cleopatra
cultivated
intellectual
and
brilliant
they
seem
to
have
reigned
for
their
social
fascinations
as
much
as
by
their
physical
beauty
hence
that
class
of
women
who
with
us
are
shunned
and
excluded
from
society
were
not
only
flattered
and
honored
but
the
class
itself
seems
to
have
been
recruited
by
those
who
were
the
most
attractive
for
their
intellectual
gifts
as
well
as
for
physical
beauty
no
woman
if
bright
witty
and
beautiful
was
avoided
because
she
was
immoral
it
was
the
immoral
women
who
often
aspired
to
the
highest
culture
they
sought
to
reign
by
making
their
homes
attractive
to
distinguished
men
their
houses
seem
to
have
been
what
the
of
noble
and
fascinating
duchesses
were
in
france
in
the
last
two
centuries
the
homes
of
virtuous
and
domestic
women
were
dull
and
wearisome
in
fact
the
modest
wives
and
daughters
of
most
men
were
confined
to
monotonous
domestic
duties
they
were
household
slaves
they
saw
but
little
of
what
we
now
call
society
i
do
not
say
that
virtue
was
not
held
in
honor
i
know
of
no
age
however
corrupt
when
it
was
not
prized
by
husbands
and
fathers
i
know
of
no
age
when
virtuous
women
did
not
shine
at
home
and
exert
a
healthful
influence
upon
men
and
secure
the
proud
regard
of
their
husbands
but
these
were
not
the
women
whose
society
was
most
sought
the
drudgeries
and
slaveries
of
domestic
life
among
the
ancients
made
women
unattractive
to
the
world
the
women
who
were
most
attractive
were
those
who
gave
or
attended
sumptuous
banquets
and
indulged
in
pleasures
that
were
demoralizing
not
domestic
women
but
bright
women
carried
away
those
prizes
which
turned
the
brain
those
who
shone
were
those
that
attached
themselves
to
men
through
their
senses
and
possibly
through
their
intellects
and
who
were
themselves
strong
in
proportion
as
men
were
weak
for
a
woman
to
appear
in
public
assemblies
with
braided
and
decorated
hair
and
ostentatious
dress
and
especially
if
she
displayed
any
gifts
of
eloquence
or
culture
was
to
proclaim
herself
one
of
the
immoral
leisurely
educated
dissolute
class
this
gives
point
to
saint
paul
strict
injunctions
to
the
women
of
corinth
to
dress
soberly
to
keep
silence
in
the
assemblies
etc
the
modest
woman
was
to
be
in
subjection
those
pagan
converts
to
the
new
way
were
to
avoid
even
the
appearance
of
evil
thus
under
paganism
the
general
influence
of
women
was
to
pull
men
down
rather
than
to
elevate
them
especially
those
who
were
attractive
in
society
virtuous
and
domestic
women
were
not
sufficiently
educated
to
have
much
influence
except
in
a
narrow
circle
even
they
in
a
social
point
of
view
were
slaves
they
could
be
given
in
marriage
without
their
consent
they
were
restricted
in
their
intercourse
with
men
they
were
confined
to
their
homes
they
had
but
few
privileges
they
had
no
books
they
led
a
life
of
terror
from
the
caprices
of
their
lords
and
masters
and
hence
inspired
no
veneration
the
wives
and
daughters
of
the
rich
tyrannized
over
their
servants
decked
themselves
with
costly
ornaments
and
were
merely
gilded
toys
whose
society
was
vapid
and
uninteresting
the
wives
and
daughters
of
the
poor
were
drudges
and
menials
without
attraction
or
influence
noisy
quarrelsome
garrulous
women
who
said
the
least
when
they
talked
the
most
hence
under
paganism
home
had
none
of
those
attractions
which
in
christian
countries
invest
it
with
such
charms
the
home
of
the
poor
was
squalid
and
repulsive
the
home
of
the
rich
was
gaudy
and
tinselled
enough
but
was
dull
and
uninspiring
what
is
home
when
women
are
ignorant
stupid
and
slavish
what
glitter
or
artistic
splendor
can
make
home
attractive
when
women
are
mere
butterflies
or
slaves
with
gilded
fetters
deprive
women
of
education
and
especially
of
that
respect
which
christian
chivalry
inspires
and
they
can
not
rise
to
be
the
equal
companions
of
men
they
are
simply
their
victims
or
their
slaves
what
is
a
home
where
women
are
treated
as
inferiors
paganism
never
recognized
their
equality
with
men
and
if
they
ever
ruled
men
it
was
by
appealing
to
their
lower
qualities
or
resorting
to
arts
and
devices
which
are
subversive
of
all
dignity
of
character
when
their
personal
beauty
fled
their
power
also
departed
a
faded
or
homely
woman
without
intelligence
or
wit
was
a
forlorn
object
in
a
pagan
home
to
be
avoided
derided
despised
a
melancholy
object
of
pity
or
neglect
so
far
as
companionship
goes
she
may
have
been
valued
as
a
cook
or
drudge
but
she
was
only
a
menial
of
all
those
sins
of
omission
of
which
paganism
is
accused
the
worst
was
that
it
gave
to
women
no
mental
resources
to
assist
them
in
poverty
or
neglect
or
isolation
when
beauty
or
fortune
deserted
them
no
home
can
be
attractive
where
women
have
no
resources
and
women
can
have
no
resources
outside
of
domestic
duties
unless
educated
to
some
art
or
something
calculated
to
draw
out
their
energies
and
higher
faculties
by
which
they
win
the
respect
and
admiration
not
of
men
only
but
of
their
own
sex
it
was
this
lack
of
education
which
paganism
withheld
from
women
which
not
only
destroyed
the
radiance
of
home
but
which
really
made
women
inferior
to
men
all
writers
poets
and
satirists
alike
speak
of
the
inferiority
of
women
to
men
not
physically
only
but
even
intellectually
and
some
authors
made
them
more
vicious
than
men
in
natural
inclination
and
when
the
mind
was
both
neglected
and
undervalued
how
could
respect
and
admiration
be
kindled
or
continue
after
sensual
charms
had
passed
away
paganism
taught
the
inequality
of
the
sexes
and
produced
it
and
when
this
inequality
is
taught
or
believed
in
or
insisted
upon
then
farewell
to
the
glory
of
homes
to
all
unbought
charms
to
the
graces
of
domestic
life
to
everything
that
gilds
our
brief
existence
with
the
radiance
of
imperishable
joy
nor
did
paganism
offer
any
consolations
to
the
injured
neglected
uninteresting
woman
of
antiquity
she
could
not
rise
above
the
condition
in
which
she
was
born
no
sympathetic
priest
directed
her
thoughts
to
another
and
higher
and
endless
life
nobody
wiped
away
her
tears
nobody
gave
encouragement
to
those
visions
of
beauty
and
serenity
for
which
the
burdened
spirit
will
under
any
oppressions
sometimes
aspire
to
enjoy
no
one
told
her
of
immortality
and
a
god
of
forgiveness
who
binds
up
the
bleeding
heart
and
promises
a
future
peace
and
bliss
paganism
was
merciful
only
in
this
that
it
did
not
open
wounds
it
could
not
heal
that
it
did
not
hold
out
hopes
and
promises
it
could
not
fulfil
that
it
did
not
remind
the
afflicted
of
miseries
from
which
they
could
not
rise
that
it
did
not
let
in
a
vision
of
glories
which
could
never
be
enjoyed
that
it
did
not
provoke
the
soul
to
indulge
in
a
bitterness
in
view
of
evils
for
which
there
was
no
remedy
that
it
did
not
educate
the
mind
for
enjoyments
which
could
never
be
reached
that
it
did
not
kindle
a
discontent
with
a
condition
from
which
there
is
no
escape
if
one
can
not
rise
above
debasement
or
misery
there
is
no
use
in
pointing
it
out
if
the
pagan
woman
was
not
seemingly
aware
of
the
degradation
which
kept
her
down
and
from
which
it
was
impossible
to
rise
paganism
did
not
add
stings
to
her
misery
by
presenting
it
as
an
accident
which
it
was
easy
to
surmount
there
would
be
no
contentment
or
submission
among
animals
if
they
were
endowed
with
the
reason
of
men
give
to
a
healthy
but
ignorant
coarse
uncultivated
country
girl
surrounded
only
with
pigs
and
chickens
almost
without
neighbors
a
glimpse
of
the
glories
of
cities
the
wonders
of
art
the
charms
of
social
life
the
triumphs
of
mind
the
capacities
of
the
soul
and
would
she
be
any
happier
if
obliged
to
remain
for
life
in
her
rustic
obscurity
and
labor
and
with
no
possible
chance
of
improving
her
condition
such
was
woman
under
paganism
she
could
rise
only
so
far
as
men
lifted
her
up
and
they
lifted
her
up
only
further
to
consummate
her
degradation
but
there
was
another
thing
which
kept
women
in
degradation
paganism
did
not
recognize
the
immaterial
and
immortal
soul
it
only
had
regard
to
the
wants
of
the
body
of
course
there
were
exceptions
there
were
sages
and
philosophers
among
the
men
who
speculated
on
the
grandest
subjects
which
can
elevate
the
mind
to
the
regions
of
immortal
truth
like
socrates
plato
epictetus
marcus
aurelius
even
as
there
were
women
who
rose
above
all
the
vile
temptations
which
surrounded
them
and
were
poets
heroines
and
benefactors
like
telessa
who
saved
argos
by
her
courage
and
volumnia
who
screened
rome
from
the
vengeance
of
her
angry
son
and
lucretia
who
destroyed
herself
rather
than
survive
the
dishonor
of
her
house
there
are
some
people
who
rise
and
triumph
over
every
kind
of
oppression
and
injury
under
paganism
there
was
the
possibility
of
the
emancipation
of
the
soul
but
not
the
probability
its
genius
was
directed
to
the
welfare
of
the
body
to
utilitarian
ends
of
life
to
ornaments
and
riches
to
luxury
and
voluptuousness
to
the
pleasures
which
are
brief
to
the
charms
of
physical
beauty
and
grace
it
could
stimulate
ambition
and
inculcate
patriotism
and
sing
of
love
if
it
coupled
the
praises
of
venus
with
the
praises
of
wine
but
everything
it
praised
or
honored
had
reference
to
this
life
and
to
the
mortal
body
it
may
have
recognized
the
mind
but
not
the
soul
which
is
greater
than
the
mind
it
had
no
aspirations
for
future
happiness
it
had
no
fears
of
future
misery
hence
the
frequency
of
suicide
under
disappointment
or
ennui
or
satiated
desire
or
fear
of
poverty
or
disgrace
or
pain
and
thus
as
paganism
did
not
take
cognizance
of
the
soul
in
its
future
existence
it
disregarded
man
highest
aspirations
it
did
not
cultivate
his
graces
it
set
but
a
slight
value
on
moral
beauty
it
thought
little
of
affections
it
spurned
gentleness
and
passive
virtues
it
saw
no
lustre
in
the
tender
eye
it
heard
no
music
in
the
tones
of
sympathy
it
was
hard
and
cold
that
which
constitutes
the
richest
beatitudes
of
love
it
could
not
see
and
did
not
care
for
ethereal
blessedness
it
despised
that
which
raises
woman
highest
it
was
indifferent
to
the
cold
atmosphere
of
paganism
froze
her
soul
and
made
her
callous
to
wrongs
and
sufferings
it
destroyed
enthusiasm
and
poetic
ardor
and
the
graces
which
shine
in
misfortune
woman
was
not
kindled
by
lofty
sentiments
since
no
one
believed
in
them
the
harmonies
of
home
had
no
poetry
and
no
inspiration
and
they
disappeared
the
face
of
woman
was
not
lighted
by
supernatural
smiles
her
caresses
had
no
spiritual
fervor
and
her
benedictions
were
unmeaning
platitudes
take
away
the
soul
of
woman
and
what
is
she
rob
her
of
her
divine
enthusiasm
and
how
vapid
and
commonplace
she
becomes
destroy
her
yearnings
to
be
a
spiritual
solace
and
how
limited
is
her
sphere
take
away
the
holy
dignity
of
the
soul
and
how
impossible
is
a
lofty
friendship
without
the
amenities
of
the
soul
there
can
be
no
real
society
crush
the
soul
of
a
woman
and
you
extinguish
her
life
and
shed
darkness
on
all
who
surround
her
she
can
not
rally
from
pain
or
labor
or
misfortune
if
her
higher
nature
is
ignored
paganism
ignored
what
is
grandest
and
truest
in
a
woman
and
she
withered
like
a
stricken
tree
she
succumbed
before
the
cold
blasts
that
froze
her
noblest
impulses
and
sunk
sullenly
into
obscurity
oh
what
a
fool
a
man
is
to
make
woman
a
slave
he
forgets
that
though
he
may
succeed
in
keeping
her
down
chained
and
fettered
by
drudgeries
she
will
be
revenged
that
though
powerless
she
will
instinctively
learn
to
hate
him
and
if
she
can
not
defy
him
she
will
scorn
him
for
not
even
a
brute
animal
will
patiently
submit
to
cruelty
still
less
a
human
soul
become
reconciled
to
injustice
and
what
is
the
possession
of
a
human
body
without
the
sympathy
of
a
living
soul
and
hence
women
under
paganism
having
no
hopes
of
future
joy
no
recognition
of
their
diviner
attributes
no
true
scope
for
energies
no
field
of
usefulness
but
in
a
dreary
home
no
ennobling
friendships
no
high
encouragements
no
education
no
lofty
companionship
utterly
unappreciated
in
what
most
distinguishes
them
and
valued
only
as
household
slaves
or
victims
of
guilty
pleasure
adorned
and
bedecked
with
trinkets
all
to
show
off
the
graces
of
the
body
alone
and
with
nothing
to
show
their
proud
equality
with
men
in
influence
if
not
in
power
in
mind
as
well
as
heart
took
no
interest
in
what
truly
elevates
society
what
schools
did
they
teach
or
even
visit
what
hospitals
did
they
enrich
what
miseries
did
they
relieve
what
charities
did
they
contribute
to
what
churches
did
they
attend
what
social
gatherings
did
they
enliven
what
missions
of
benevolence
did
they
embark
in
what
were
these
to
women
who
did
not
know
what
was
the
most
precious
thing
they
had
or
when
this
precious
thing
was
allowed
to
run
to
waste
what
was
there
for
a
woman
to
do
with
an
unrecognized
soul
but
gird
herself
with
ornaments
and
curiously
braid
her
hair
and
ransack
shops
for
new
cosmetics
and
hunt
for
new
perfumes
and
recline
on
luxurious
couches
and
issue
orders
to
attendant
slaves
and
join
in
seductive
dances
and
indulge
in
frivolous
gossip
and
entice
by
the
display
of
sensual
charms
her
highest
aspiration
was
to
adorn
a
perishable
body
and
vanity
became
the
spring
of
life
and
the
men
without
the
true
sanctities
and
beatitudes
of
married
life
without
the
tender
companionship
which
cultivated
women
give
without
the
hallowed
friendships
which
the
soul
alone
can
keep
alive
despising
women
who
were
either
toys
or
slaves
fled
from
their
dull
monotonous
and
dreary
homes
to
the
circus
and
the
theatre
and
the
banqueting
hall
for
excitement
or
they
did
not
seek
society
for
there
can
be
no
high
society
where
women
do
not
preside
and
inspire
and
guide
society
is
a
christian
institution
it
was
born
among
our
german
ancestors
amid
the
inspiring
glories
of
chivalry
it
was
made
for
women
as
well
as
men
of
social
cravings
and
aspirations
which
have
their
seat
in
what
paganism
ignored
society
under
paganism
was
confined
to
men
at
banquets
or
symposia
where
women
seldom
entered
unless
for
the
amusement
of
men
never
for
their
improvement
and
still
less
for
their
restraint
it
was
not
until
christianity
permeated
the
old
pagan
civilization
and
destroyed
its
idols
that
the
noble
paulas
and
marcellas
and
fabiolas
arose
to
dignify
human
friendships
and
give
fascination
to
reunions
of
cultivated
women
and
gifted
men
that
the
seeds
of
society
were
sown
it
was
not
until
the
natural
veneration
which
the
gothic
nations
seem
to
have
had
for
women
even
in
their
native
forests
had
ripened
into
devotion
and
gallantry
under
the
teachings
of
christian
priests
that
the
true
position
of
women
was
understood
and
after
their
equality
was
recognized
in
the
feudal
castles
of
the
middle
ages
the
of
the
seventeenth
and
eighteenth
centuries
established
their
claims
as
the
inspiring
geniuses
of
what
we
call
society
then
and
not
till
then
did
physical
beauty
pale
before
the
brilliancy
of
the
mind
and
the
radiance
of
the
soul
at
last
recognized
as
the
highest
charm
of
woman
the
leaders
of
society
became
not
the
ornamented
and
painted
which
had
attracted
grecian
generals
and
statesmen
and
men
of
letters
but
the
witty
and
the
genial
and
the
dignified
matrons
who
were
capable
of
instructing
and
inspiring
men
superior
to
themselves
with
eyes
beaming
with
intellectual
radiance
and
features
changing
with
perpetual
variety
modern
society
created
by
christianity
since
only
christianity
recognizes
what
is
most
truly
attractive
and
ennobling
among
women
is
a
great
advance
over
the
banquets
of
imperial
romans
and
the
symposia
of
gifted
greeks
but
even
this
does
not
satisfy
woman
in
her
loftiest
aspirations
the
soul
which
animates
and
inspires
her
is
boundless
its
wants
can
not
be
fully
met
even
in
an
assemblage
of
wits
and
beauties
the
soul
of
madame
de
staël
pined
amid
all
her
social
triumphs
the
soul
craves
friendships
intellectual
banquetings
and
religious
aspirations
and
unless
the
emancipated
soul
of
woman
can
have
these
wants
gratified
she
droops
even
amid
the
glories
of
society
she
is
killed
not
as
a
hero
perishes
on
a
but
she
dies
as
madame
de
maintenon
said
that
she
died
amid
the
imposing
splendors
of
versailles
it
is
only
the
teachings
and
influences
of
that
divine
religion
which
made
bethany
the
centre
of
true
social
banquetings
to
the
wandering
and
isolated
man
of
sorrows
which
can
keep
the
soul
alive
amid
the
cares
the
burdens
and
the
duties
which
bend
down
every
son
and
daughter
of
adam
however
gilded
may
be
the
outward
life
how
grateful
then
should
women
be
to
that
influence
which
has
snatched
them
from
the
pollutions
and
heartless
slaveries
of
paganism
and
given
dignity
to
their
higher
nature
it
is
to
them
that
it
has
brought
the
greatest
boon
and
made
them
triumphant
over
the
evils
of
life
and
how
thoughtless
how
misguided
how
ungrateful
is
that
woman
who
would
exchange
the
priceless
blessings
which
christianity
has
brought
to
her
for
those
ornaments
those
excitements
and
those
pleasures
which
ancient
paganism
gave
as
the
only
solace

glory
and
shame
we
have
now
surveyed
what
was
most
glorious
in
the
states
of
antiquity
we
have
seen
a
civilization
which
in
many
respects
rivals
all
that
modern
nations
have
to
show
in
art
in
literature
in
philosophy
in
laws
in
the
mechanism
of
government
in
the
cultivated
face
of
nature
in
military
strength
in
aesthetic
culture
the
greeks
and
romans
were
our
equals
and
this
high
civilization
was
reached
by
the
native
and
unaided
strength
of
man
by
the
power
of
will
by
courage
by
perseverance
by
genius
by
fortunate
circumstances
we
are
filled
with
admiration
by
all
these
trophies
of
genius
and
can
not
but
feel
that
only
superior
races
could
have
accomplished
such
mighty
triumphs
yet
all
this
splendid
exterior
was
deceptive
for
the
deeper
we
penetrate
the
social
condition
of
the
people
the
more
we
feel
disgust
and
pity
supplanting
all
feelings
of
admiration
and
wonder
the
roman
empire
especially
which
had
gathered
into
its
strong
embrace
the
whole
world
and
was
the
natural
inheritor
of
all
the
achievements
of
all
the
nations
in
its
shame
and
degradation
suggests
melancholy
feelings
in
reference
to
the
destiny
of
man
so
far
as
his
happiness
and
welfare
depend
upon
his
own
unaided
efforts
it
is
a
sad
picture
of
oppression
injustice
crime
and
wretchedness
which
i
have
now
to
present
glory
is
succeeded
by
shame
strength
by
weakness
and
virtue
by
vice
the
condition
of
the
mass
is
deplorable
and
even
the
great
and
fortunate
shine
in
a
false
and
fictitious
light
we
see
laws
theoretically
good
practically
perverted
and
selfishness
and
egotism
the
mainsprings
of
life
we
see
energies
misdirected
and
art
corrupted
all
noble
aspirations
have
fled
and
the
good
and
the
wise
retire
from
active
life
in
despair
and
misanthropy
poets
flatter
the
tyrants
who
trample
on
human
rights
while
sensuality
and
luxurious
pleasure
absorb
the
depraved
thoughts
of
a
perverse
generation
the
first
thing
which
arrests
our
attention
as
we
survey
the
civilized
countries
of
the
old
world
is
the
imperial
despotism
of
rome
the
empire
indeed
enjoyed
quietude
and
society
was
no
longer
rent
by
factions
and
parties
demagogues
no
longer
disturbed
the
public
peace
nor
were
the
provinces
ransacked
and
devastated
to
provide
for
the
means
of
carrying
on
war
so
long
as
men
did
not
oppose
the
government
they
were
safe
from
molestation
and
were
left
to
pursue
their
business
and
pleasure
in
their
own
way
imperial
cruelty
was
not
often
visited
on
the
humble
classes
it
was
the
policy
of
the
emperors
to
amuse
and
flatter
the
people
while
depriving
them
of
political
rights
hence
social
life
was
free
all
were
at
liberty
to
seek
their
pleasures
and
gains
all
were
proud
of
their
metropolis
with
its
gilded
glories
and
its
fascinating
pleasures
outrages
extortions
and
disturbances
were
punished
order
reigned
and
all
classes
felt
secure
they
could
sleep
without
fear
of
robbery
or
assassination
in
short
all
the
arguments
which
can
be
adduced
in
favor
of
despotism
in
contrast
with
civil
war
and
violence
show
that
it
was
beneficial
in
its
immediate
effects
nevertheless
it
was
a
most
lamentable
change
from
that
condition
of
things
which
existed
before
the
civil
wars
roman
liberties
were
prostrated
forever
noble
sentiments
and
aspirations
were
rebuked
under
the
emperors
we
read
of
no
more
great
orators
like
cicero
battling
for
human
rights
and
defending
the
public
weal
eloquence
was
suppressed
nor
was
there
liberty
of
speech
even
in
the
senate
it
was
treason
to
find
fault
with
any
public
acts
from
the
pillars
of
hercules
to
the
caspian
sea
one
stern
will
ruled
all
classes
and
orders
no
one
could
fly
from
the
agents
and
ministers
of
the
emperor
he
controlled
the
army
the
senate
the
judiciary
the
internal
administration
of
the
empire
and
the
religious
worship
of
the
people
all
offices
honors
and
emoluments
emanated
from
him
all
influences
conspired
to
elevate
the
man
whom
no
one
could
hope
successfully
to
rival
revolt
was
madness
and
treason
absurdity
nor
did
the
emperors
attempt
to
check
the
gigantic
social
evils
of
the
empire
they
did
not
seek
to
prevent
irreligion
luxury
slavery
and
usury
the
encroachments
of
the
rich
upon
the
poor
the
tyranny
of
foolish
fashions
demoralizing
sports
and
pleasures
and
all
the
follies
which
lax
principles
of
morality
allowed
they
fed
the
rabble
with
corn
oil
and
wine
and
thus
encouraged
idleness
and
dissipation
the
world
never
saw
a
more
rapid
retrogression
in
human
rights
or
a
greater
prostration
of
liberties
taxes
were
imposed
according
to
the
pleasure
or
necessities
of
the
government
provincial
governors
became
still
more
rapacious
and
cruel
judges
hesitated
to
decide
against
the
government
patriotism
in
its
most
enlarged
sense
became
an
impossibility
all
lofty
spirits
were
crushed
corruption
in
all
forms
of
administration
fearfully
increased
for
there
was
no
safeguard
against
it
theoretically
absolutism
may
be
the
best
government
if
rulers
are
wise
and
just
but
practically
as
men
are
despotisms
are
generally
cruel
and
revengeful
despotism
implies
slavery
and
slavery
is
the
worst
condition
of
mankind
it
can
not
be
questioned
that
many
virtuous
princes
reigned
at
rome
who
would
have
ornamented
any
age
or
country
titus
hadrian
marcus
aurelius
antoninus
pius
alexander
severus
tacitus
probus
carus
constantine
theodosius
were
all
men
of
remarkable
virtues
as
well
as
talents
they
did
what
they
could
to
promote
public
prosperity
marcus
aurelius
was
one
of
the
purest
and
noblest
characters
of
antiquity
theodosius
for
genius
and
virtue
ranks
with
the
most
illustrious
sovereigns
that
ever
wore
a
crown
with
charlemagne
with
alfred
with
william
with
gustavus
adolphus
but
it
matters
not
whether
the
emperors
were
good
or
bad
if
the
régime
to
which
they
consecrated
their
energies
was
exerted
to
crush
the
liberties
of
mankind
the
imperial
despotism
whether
brilliant
or
disgraceful
was
a
mournful
retrograde
step
in
civilization
it
implied
the
extinction
of
patriotism
and
the
general
degradation
of
the
people
and
would
have
been
impossible
in
the
days
of
cato
scipio
or
metellus
if
we
turn
from
the
emperors
to
the
class
which
before
the
dictatorship
of
julius
caesar
had
the
ascendency
in
the
state
and
for
several
centuries
the
supreme
power
we
shall
find
but
little
that
is
flattering
to
a
nation
or
to
humanity
under
the
emperors
the
aristocracy
had
degenerated
in
morals
as
well
as
influence
they
still
retained
their
enormous
fortunes
originally
acquired
as
governors
of
provinces
and
continually
increased
by
fortunate
marriages
and
speculations
indeed
nothing
was
more
marked
and
melancholy
at
rome
than
the
vast
disproportion
in
fortunes
in
the
better
days
of
the
republic
property
was
more
equally
divided
the
citizens
were
not
ambitious
for
more
land
than
they
could
conveniently
cultivate
but
the
lands
obtained
by
conquest
gradually
fell
into
the
possession
of
powerful
families
the
classes
of
society
widened
as
great
fortunes
were
accumulated
pride
of
wealth
kept
pace
with
pride
of
ancestry
and
when
plebeian
families
had
obtained
great
estates
they
were
amalgamated
with
the
old
aristocracy
the
equestrian
order
founded
substantially
on
wealth
grew
daily
in
importance
knights
ultimately
rivalled
senatorial
families
even
freedmen
in
an
age
of
commercial
speculation
became
powerful
for
their
riches
the
pursuit
of
money
became
a
passion
and
the
rich
assumed
all
the
importance
and
consideration
which
had
once
been
bestowed
upon
those
who
had
rendered
great
public
services
as
the
wealth
of
the
world
flowed
naturally
to
the
capital
rome
became
a
city
of
princes
whose
fortunes
were
almost
incredible
it
took
eighty
thousand
dollars
a
year
to
support
the
ordinary
senatorial
dignity
some
senators
owned
whole
provinces
trimalchio
a
rich
freedman

diminishing

of
three
hundred
millions
of
sesterces

the
philosopher
amassed
an
enormous
fortune
as
the
romans
were
a
sensual
ostentatious
and
luxurious
people
they
accordingly
wasted
their
fortunes
by
an
extravagance
in
their
living
which
has
had
no
parallel
the
pleasures
of
the
table
and
the
cares
of
the
kitchen
were
the
most
serious
avocation
of
the
aristocracy
in
the
days
of
the
greatest
corruption
they
had
around
them
regular
courts
of
parasites
and
flatterers
and
they
employed
even
persons
of
high
rank
as
their
chamberlains
and
stewards
carving
was
taught
in
celebrated
schools
and
the
masters
of
this
sublime
art
were
held
in
higher
estimation
than
philosophers
or
poets

such
perfection
now

brought
that

crimes

for
their

their

their
tables
and
their
fine
old
plate
unbounded
pride
insolence
inhumanity
selfishness
and
scorn
marked
this
noble
class
of
course
there
were
exceptions
but
the
historians
and
satirists
give
the
saddest
pictures
of
their
depravity
the
sole
result
of
friendship
with
a
great
man
was
a
meal
at
which
flattery
and
sycophancy
were
expected
but
the
best
wine
was
drunk
by
the
host
instead
of
by
the
guest
provinces
were
ransacked
for
fish
and
fowl
and
game
for
the
tables
of
the
great
and
sensualism
was
thought
to
be
no
reproach
they
violated
the
laws
of
chastity
and
decorum
they
scourged
to
death
their
slaves
they
degraded
their
wives
and
sisters
they
patronized
the
most
demoralizing
sports
they
enriched
themselves
by
usury
and
monopolies
they
practised
no
generosity
except
at
their
banquets
when
ostentation
balanced
their
avarice
they
measured
everything
by
the
they
had
no
taste
for
literature
but
they
rewarded
sculptors
and
painters
who
prostituted
art
to
their
vanity
or
passions
they
had
no
reverence
for
religion
and
ridiculed
the
gods
their
distinguishing
vices
were
meanness
and
servility
the
pursuit
of
money
by
every
artifice
the
absence
of
honor
and
unblushing
sensuality
gibbon
has
eloquently
abridged
the
remarks
of
ammianus
marcellinus
respecting
these
people
they
contend
with
each
other
in
the
empty
vanity
of
titles
and
surnames
they
affect
to
multiply
their
likenesses
in
statues
of
bronze
or
marble
nor
are
they
satisfied
unless
these
statues
are
covered
with
plates
of
gold
they
boast
of
the
of
their
estates
they
measure
their
rank
and
consequence
by
the
loftiness
of
their
chariots
and
the
weighty
magnificence
of
their
dress
their
long
robes
of
silk
and
purple
float
in
the
wind
and
as
they
are
agitated
by
art
or
accident
they
discover
the
under
garments
the
rich
tunics
embroidered
with
the
figures
of
various
animals
followed
by
a
train
of
fifty
servants
and
tearing
up
the
pavement
they
move
along
the
streets
as
if
they
travelled
with
and
the
example
of
the
senators
is
boldly
imitated
by
the
matrons
and
ladies
whose
covered
carriages
are
continually
driving
round
the
immense
space
of
the
city
and
suburbs
whenever
they
condescend
to
enter
the
public
baths
they
assume
on
their
entrance
a
tone
of
loud
and
insolent
command
and
maintain
a
haughty
demeanor
which
perhaps
might
have
been
excused
in
the
great
marcellus
after
the
conquest
of
syracuse
sometimes
these
heroes
undertake
more
arduous
achievements
they
visit
their
estates
in
italy
and
procure
themselves
by
servile
hands
the
amusements
of
the
chase
and
if
at
any
time
especially
on
a
hot
day
they
have
the
courage
to
sail
in
their
gilded
galleys
from
the
lucrine
lake
to
their
elegant
villas
on
the
of
puteoli
and
cargeta
they
compare
these
expeditions
to
the
marches
of
caesar
and
alexander
yet
should
a
fly
presume
to
settle
on
the
silken
folds
of
their
gilded
umbrellas
should
a
sunbeam
penetrate
through
some
unguarded
chink
they
deplore
their
intolerable
hardships
and
lament
in
affected
language
that
they
were
not
born
in
the
regions
of
eternal
darkness
in
the
exercise
of
domestic
jurisdiction
they
express
an
exquisite
sensibility
for
any
personal
injury
and
a
contemptuous
indifference
for
the
rest
of
mankind
when
they
have
called
for
warm
water
should
a
slave
be
tardy
in
his
obedience
he
is
chastised
with
a
hundred
lashes
should
he
commit
a
wilful
murder
his
master
will
mildly
observe
that
he
is
a
worthless
fellow
and
shall
be
punished
if
he
repeat
the
offence
if
a
foreigner
of
no
contemptible
rank
be
introduced
to
these
senators
he
is
welcomed
with
such
warm
professions
that
he
retires
charmed
with
their
affability
but
when
he
repeats
his
visit
he
is
surprised
and
mortified
to
find
that
his
name
his
person
and
his
country
are
forgotten
the
modest
the
sober
and
the
learned
are
rarely
invited
to
their
sumptuous
banquets
only
the
most
worthless
of
mankind
parasites
who
applaud
every
look
and
gesture
who
gaze
with
rapture
on
marble
columns
and
variegated
pavements
and
strenuously
praise
the
pomp
and
elegance
which
he
is
taught
to
consider
as
a
part
of
his
personal
merit
at
the
roman
table
the
birds
the
squirrels
the
fish
which
appear
of
uncommon
size
are
contemplated
with
curious
attention
and
notaries
are
summoned
to
attest
by
authentic
record
their
real
weight
another
method
of
introduction
into
the
houses
of
the
great
is
skill
in
games
which
is
a
sure
road
to
wealth
and
reputation
a
master
of
this
sublime
art
if
placed
at
a
supper
below
a
magistrate
displays
in
his
countenance
a
surprise
and
indignation
which
cato
might
be
supposed
to
feel
when
refused
the
praetorship
the
acquisition
of
knowledge
seldom
engages
the
attention
of
the
nobles
who
abhor
the
fatigue
and
disdain
the
advantages
of
study
and
the
only
books
they
peruse
are
the
of
juvenal
or
the
fabulous
histories
of
marius
maximus
the
libraries
they
have
inherited
from
their
fathers
are
secluded
like
dreary
sepulchres
from
the
light
of
day
but
the
costly
instruments
of
the
theatre
flutes
and
hydraulic
organs
are
constructed
for
their
use
in
their
palaces
sound
is
preferred
to
sense
and
the
care
of
the
body
to
that
of
the
mind
the
suspicion
of
a
malady
is
of
sufficient
weight
to
excuse
the
visits
of
the
most
intimate
friends
the
prospect
of
gain
will
urge
a
rich
and
gouty
senator
as
far
as
spoleta
every
sentiment
of
arrogance
and
dignity
is
suppressed
in
the
hope
of
an
inheritance
or
legacy
and
a
wealthy
childless
citizen
is
the
most
powerful
of
the
romans
the
distress
which
follows
and
chastises
extravagant
luxury
often
reduces
the
great
to
use
the
most
humiliating
expedients
when
they
wish
to
borrow
they
employ
the
base
and
supplicating
style
of
the
slaves
in
the
comedy
but
when
they
are
called
upon
to
pay
they
assume
the
royal
and
tragic
declamations
of
the
grandsons
of
hercules
if
the
demand
is
repeated
they
readily
procure
some
trusty
sycophant
to
maintain
a
charge
of
poison
or
magic
against
the
insolent
creditor
who
is
seldom
released
from
prison
until
he
has
signed
a
discharge
of
the
whole
debt
and
these
vices
are
mixed
with
a
puerile
superstition
which
disgraces
their
understanding
they
listen
with
confidence
to
the
productions
of
haruspices
who
pretend
to
read
in
the
entrails
of
victims
the
signs
of
future
greatness
and
prosperity
and
this
superstition
is
observed
among
those
very
sceptics
who
impiously
deny
or
doubt
the
existence
of
a
celestial
power
such
in
the
latter
days
of
the
empire
was
the
leading
class
at
rome
and
probably
also
in
the
cities
which
aped
the
fashions
of
the
capital
frivolity
and
luxury
loosened
all
the
ties
of
society
they
were
bound
up
in
themselves
and
had
no
care
for
the
people
except
as
they
might
extract
more
money
from
them
as
for
the
miserable
class
whom
the
patricians
oppressed
their
condition
became
worse
every
day
from
the
accession
of
the
emperors
the
plebeians
had
ever
disdained
those
arts
which
now
occupied
the
middle
classes
these
were
intrusted
to
slaves
originally
they
employed
themselves
upon
the
lands
which
had
been
obtained
by
conquest
but
these
lands
were
gradually
absorbed
or
usurped
by
the
large
proprietors
the
small
farmers
oppressed
with
debt
and
usury
parted
with
their
lands
to
their
wealthy
creditors
even
in
the
time
of
cicero
it
was
computed
that
there
were
only
about
two
thousand
citizens
possessed
of
independent
property
these
two
thousand
persons
owned
the
world
the
rest
were
dependent
and
powerless
and
would
have
perished
but
for
largesses
monthly
distributions
of
corn
were
converted
into
daily
allowance
for
bread
the
people
were
amused
with
games
and
festivals
fed
like
slaves
and
of
course
lost
at
last
even
the
semblance
of
manliness
and
independence
they
loitered
in
the
public
streets
and
dissipated
in
gaming
their
miserable
pittance
they
spent
the
hours
of
the
night
in
the
lowest
resorts
of
crime
and
misery
they
expired
in
wretched
apartments
without
attracting
the
attention
of
government
pestilence
famine
and
squalid
misery
thinned
their
ranks
and
they
would
have
been
annihilated
but
for
constant
accession
to
their
numbers
from
the
provinces
in
the
busy
streets
of
rome
might
be
seen
adventurers
from
all
parts
of
the
world
disgraced
by
all
the
various
vices
of
their
respective
countries
they
had
no
education
and
but
small
religious
advantages
they
were
held
in
terror
by
both
priests
and
nobles
the
priest
terrifying
them
with
egyptian
sorceries
the
nobles
crushing
them
by
iron
weight
like
lazzaroni
they
lived
in
the
streets
or
were
crowded
into
filthy
tenements
a
gladiatorial
show
delighted
them
but
the
circus
was
their
peculiar
joy
here
they
sought
to
drown
the
consciousness
of
their
squalid
degradation
they
were
sold
into
slavery
for
trifling
debts
they
had
no
homes
the
poor
man
had
no
ambition
or
hope
his
wife
was
a
slave
his
children
were
precocious
demons
whose
prattle
was
the
cry
for
bread
whose
laughter
was
the
howl
of
pandemonium
whose
sports
were
the
tricks
of
premature
iniquity
whose
beauty
was
the
squalor
of
disease
and
filth
he
fled
from
a
wife
in
whom
he
had
no
trust
from
children
in
whom
he
had
no
hope
from
brothers
for
whom
he
felt
no
sympathy
from
parents
for
whom
he
felt
no
reverence
the
circus
was
his
home
the
fights
of
wild
beasts
were
his
consolation
the
future
was
a
blank
death
was
the
release
from
suffering
there
were
no
hospitals
for
the
sick
and
the
old
except
one
on
an
island
in
the
tiber
the
old
and
helpless
were
left
to
die
unpitied
and
unconsoled
suicide
was
so
common
that
it
attracted
no
attention
superstition
culminated
at
rome
for
there
were
seen
the
priests
and
devotees
of
all
the
countries
that
it
governed
the
daughters
of
isis
with
drum
and
timbrel
and
wanton
mien
devotees
of
the
persian
mithras
emasculated
asiatics
priests
of
cybele
with
their
wild
dances
and
discordant
cries
worshippers
of
the
great
goddess
diana
barbarian
captives
with
the
rites
of
teuton
priests
syrians
jews
chaldaean
astrologers
and
thessalian
sorcerers
the
crowds
which
flocked
to
rome
from
the
eastern
shores
of
the
mediterranean
brought
with
them
practices
extremely
demoralizing
the
awful
rites
of
initiation
the
tricks
of
magicians
the
pretended
virtues
of
amulets
and
charms
the
riddles
of
emblematical
idolatry
with
which
the
superstition
of
the
east
abounded
amused
the
languid
voluptuaries
who
had
neither
the
energy
for
a
moral
belief
nor
the
boldness
requisite
for
logical
scepticism
we
can
not
pass
by
in
this
enumeration
of
the
different
classes
of
roman
society
the
number
and
condition
of
slaves
a
large
part
of
the
population
belonged
to
this
servile
class
originally
brought
in
by
foreign
conquest
it
was
increased
by
those
who
could
not
pay
their
debts
the
single
campaign
of
regulus
introduced
as
many
captives
as
made
up
a
fifth
part
of
the
whole
population
four
hundred
were
maintained
in
a
single
palace
at
a
comparatively
early
period
a
freedman
in
the
time
of
augustus
left
behind
him
hundred
and
sixteen
horace
regarded
two
hundred
as
the
suitable
establishment
for
a
gentleman
some
senators
owned
twenty
thousand
gibbon
estimates
the
number
of
slaves
at
about
sixty
millions
of
the
whole
population
one
hundred
thousand
captives
were
taken
in
the
jewish
war
who
were
sold
as
slaves
and
sold
as
cheap
as
horses
william
blair
supposes
that
there
were
three
slaves
to
one
freeman
from
the
conquest
of
greece
to
the
reign
of
alexander
severus
slaves
often
cost
two
hundred
thousand
sesterces
yet
everybody
was
eager
to
possess
a
slave
at
one
time
the
slave
life
was
at
the
absolute
control
of
his
master
he
could
be
treated
at
all
times
with
brutal
severity
fettered
and
branded
he
toiled
to
cultivate
the
lands
of
an
imperious
master
and
at
night
was
shut
up
in
a
subterranean
cell
the
laws
hardly
recognized
his
claim
to
be
considered
a
moral
agent
he
was
hominum
he
could
acquire
no
rights
social
or
political
he
was
incapable
of
inheriting
property
or
making
a
will
or
contracting
a
legal
marriage
his
value
was
estimated
like
that
of
a
brute
he
was
a
thing
and
not
a
person
a
piece
of
furniture
possessed
of
life
he
was
his
property
to
be
scourged
or
tortured
or
crucified
if
a
wealthy
proprietor
died
under
circumstances
which
excited
suspicion
of
foul
play
his
whole
household
was
put
to
torture
it
is
recorded
that
on
the
murder
of
a
man
of
consular
dignity
by
a
slave
every
slave
in
his
possession
was
condemned
to
death
slaves
swelled
the
useless
rabbles
of
the
cities
and
devoured
the
revenues
of
the
state
all
manual
labor
was
done
by
slaves
in
towns
as
well
as
the
country
they
were
used
in
the
navy
to
propel
the
galleys
even
the
mechanical
arts
were
cultivated
by
the
slaves
nay
more
slaves
were
schoolmasters
secretaries
actors
musicians
and
physicians
for
in
intelligence
they
were
often
on
an
equality
with
their
masters
slaves
were
procured
from
greece
and
asia
minor
and
syria
as
well
as
from
gaul
and
the
african
deserts
they
were
white
as
well
as
black
all
captives
in
war
were
made
slaves
also
unfortunate
debtors
sometimes
they
could
regain
their
freedom
but
generally
their
condition
became
more
and
more
deplorable
what
a
state
of
society
when
a
refined
and
cultivated
greek
could
be
made
to
obey
the
most
offensive
orders
of
a
capricious
and
sensual
roman
without
remuneration
without
thanks
without
favor
without
redress
what
was
to
be
expected
of
a
class
who
had
no
object
to
live
for
they
became
the
most
degraded
of
mortals
ready
for
pillage
and
justly
to
be
feared
in
the
hour
of
danger
slavery
undoubtedly
proved
the
most
destructive
canker
of
the
roman
state
it
was
this
social
evil
more
than
political
misrule
which
undermined
the
empire
slavery
proved
at
rome
a
monstrous
curse
destroying
all
manliness
of
character
creating
contempt
of
honest
labor
making
men
timorous
yet
cruel
idle
frivolous
weak
dependent
powerless
the
empire
might
have
lasted
centuries
longer
but
for
this
incubus
the
standing
disgrace
of
the
pagan
world
paganism
never
recognized
what
is
most
noble
and
glorious
in
man
never
recognized
his
equality
his
common
brotherhood
his
natural
rights
it
had
no
compunction
no
remorse
in
depriving
human
beings
of
their
highest
privileges
its
whole
tendency
was
to
degrade
the
soul
and
to
cause
forgetfulness
of
immortality
slavery
thrives
best
when
the
generous
instincts
are
suppressed
when
egotism
sensuality
and
pride
are
the
dominant
springs
of
human
action
the
same
influences
which
tended
to
rob
man
of
the
rights
which
god
has
given
him
and
produce
cruelty
and
heartlessness
in
the
general
intercourse
of
life
also
tended
to
degrade
the
female
sex
in
the
earlier
age
of
the
republic
when
the
people
were
poor
and
life
was
simple
and
primitive
and
heroism
and
patriotism
were
characteristic
woman
was
comparatively
virtuous
and
respected
she
asserted
her
natural
equality
and
led
a
life
of
domestic
tranquillity
employed
upon
the
training
of
her
children
and
inspiring
her
husband
to
noble
deeds
but
under
the
emperors
these
virtues
had
fled
woman
was
miserably
educated
being
taught
by
a
slave
or
some
greek
chambermaid
accustomed
to
ribald
conversation
and
fed
with
idle
tales
and
silly
superstitions
she
was
regarded
as
more
vicious
in
natural
inclination
than
man
and
was
chiefly
valued
for
household
labors
she
was
reduced
to
dependence
she
saw
but
little
of
her
brothers
or
relatives
she
was
confined
to
her
home
as
if
it
were
a
prison
she
was
guarded
by
eunuchs
and
female
slaves
she
was
given
in
marriage
without
her
consent
she
could
be
easily
divorced
she
was
valued
only
as
a
domestic
servant
or
as
an
animal
to
prevent
the
extinction
of
families
she
was
regarded
as
the
inferior
of
her
husband
to
whom
she
was
a
victim
a
toy
or
a
slave
love
after
marriage
was
not
frequent
since
woman
did
not
shine
in
the
virtues
by
which
love
is
kept
alive
she
became
timorous
or
frivolous
without
dignity
or
public
esteem
her
happiness
was
in
extravagant
attire
in
elaborate
in
rings
and
bracelets
in
a
retinue
of
servants
in
gilded
apartments
in
luxurious
couches
in
voluptuous
dances
in
exciting
banquets
in
demoralizing
spectacles
in
frivolous
gossip
in
inglorious
idleness
if
virtuous
it
was
not
so
much
from
principle
as
from
fear
hence
she
resorted
to
all
sorts
of
arts
to
deceive
her
husband
her
genius
was
sharpened
by
perpetual
devices
and
cunning
was
her
great
resource
she
cultivated
no
lofty
friendships
she
engaged
in
no
philanthropic
mission
she
cherished
no
ennobling
sentiments
she
kindled
no
chivalrous
admiration
her
amusements
were
frivolous
her
taste
vitiated
her
education
neglected
her
rights
violated
her
sympathy
despised
her
aspirations
scorned
and
here
i
do
not
allude
to
great
and
infamous
examples
that
history
has
handed
down
in
the
sober
pages
of
suetonius
and
tacitus
or
that
unblushing
depravity
which
stands
out
in
the
bitter
satires
of
those
times
i
speak
not
of
the
adultery
the
poisoning
the
infanticide
the
debauchery
the
cruelty
of
which
history
accuses
the
messalinas
and
agrippinas
of
imperial
rome
i
allude
not
to
the
orgies
of
the
palatine
hill
or
the
abominations
which
are
inferred
from
the
paintings
of
pompeii
i
mean
the
general
frivolity
and
extravagance
and
demoralization
of
the
women
of
the
roman
empire
marriage
was
considered
inexpedient
unless
large
dowries
were
brought
to
the
husband
numerous
were
the
efforts
of
emperors
to
promote
honorable
marriages
but
the
relation
was
shunned
courtesans
usurped
the
privileges
of
wives
and
with
unblushing
effrontery
a
man
was
derided
who
contemplated
matrimony
for
there
was
but
little
confidence
in
female
virtue
or
capacity
and
woman
lost
all
her
fascination
when
age
had
destroyed
her
beauty
even
her
very
virtues
were
distasteful
to
her
husband
when
as
sometimes
happened
the
wife
gained
the
ascendency
by
her
charms
she
was
tyrannical
her
relatives
incited
her
to
despoil
her
husband
she
lived
amid
incessant
broils
she
had
no
care
for
the
future
and
exceeded
man
in
prodigality
the
government
of
her
house
is
no
more
merciful
says
juvenal
than
the
court
of
a
sicilian
tyrant
in
order
to
render
herself
attractive
she
exhausted
all
the
arts
of
cosmetics
and
elaborate
she
delighted
in
magical
incantations
and
in
the
bitter
satire
of
juvenal
we
get
an
impression
most
melancholy
and
loathsome
were
long
to
tell
what
philters
they
provide
what
drugs
to
set
a
aside
women
in
judgment
weak
in
feeling
strong
by
every
gust
of
passion
borne
along
to
a
fond
spouse
a
wife
no
mercy
shows
though
warmed
with
equal
fires
she
mocks
his
woes
and
triumphs
in
his
spoils
her
wayward
will
defeats
his
bliss
and
turns
his
good
to
women
support
the
bar
they
love
the
law
and
raise
litigious
questions
for
a
straw
nay
more
they
fence
who
has
not
marked
their
oil
their
purple
rigs
for
this
preposterous
toil
a
woman
stops
at
nothing
when
she
wears
rich
emeralds
round
her
neck
and
in
her
ears
pearls
of
enormous
size
these
justify
her
faults
and
make
all
lawful
in
her
eye
more
shame
to
rome
in
every
street
are
found
the
essenced
lypanti
with
roses
crowned
the
gay
miletan
and
the
tarentine
lewd
petulant
and
reeling
ripe
with
wine
in
the
sixth
satire
of
juvenal
is
found
the
most
severe
delineation
of
woman
that
ever
mortal
penned
doubtless
he
is
libellous
and
extravagant
for
only
infamous
women
can
stoop
to
such
arts
and
degradations
as
would
seem
to
have
been
common
in
his
time
but
with
all
his
probable
exaggeration
we
are
forced
to
feel
that
but
few
women
even
in
the
highest
class
except
those
converted
to
christianity
showed
the
virtues
of
a
lucretia
a
volumnia
a
cornelia
or
an
octavia
the
lofty
virtues
of
a
perpetua
a
felicitas
an
agnes
a
paula
a
blessilla
a
fabiola
would
have
adorned
any
civilization
but
the
great
mass
were
what
they
were
in
greece
even
in
the
days
of
pericles
what
they
have
ever
been
under
the
influence
of
paganism
what
they
ever
will
be
without
christianity
to
guide
them
victims
or
slaves
of
man
revenging
themselves
by
squandering
his
wealth
stealing
his
secrets
betraying
his
interests
and
deserting
his
home
another
essential
but
demoralizing
feature
of
roman
society
was
to
be
found
in
the
games
and
festivals
and
gladiatorial
shows
which
accustomed
the
people
to
unnatural
excitement
and
familiarity
with
cruelty
and
suffering
they
made
all
ordinary
pleasures
insipid
they
ended
in
making
homicide
an
institution
the
butcheries
of
the
amphitheatre
exerted
a
fascination
which
diverted
the
mind
from
literature
art
and
the
enjoyments
of
domestic
life
very
early
they
were
the
favorite
sport
of
the
romans
marcus
and
decimus
brutus
employed
gladiators
in
celebrating
the
obsequies
of
their
fathers
nearly
three
centuries
before
christ
the
wealth
and
ingenuity
of
the
aristocracy
were
taxed
to
the
utmost
to
content
the
populace
and
provide
food
for
the
indiscriminate
slaughter
of
the
circus
where
brute
fought
with
brute
and
man
again
with
man
or
where
the
skill
and
weapons
of
the
latter
were
matched
against
the
strength
and
ferocity
of
the
first
pompey
let
loose
six
hundred
lions
in
the
arena
in
one
day
augustus
delighted
the
people
with
four
hundred
and
twenty
panthers
the
games
of
trajan
lasted
one
hundred
and
twenty
days
when
ten
thousand
gladiators
fought
and
ten
thousand
beasts
were
slain
titus
slaughtered
five
thousand
animals
at
a
time
twenty
elephants
contended
according
to
pliny
against
a
band
of
six
hundred
captives

reserved
six
hundred

for
one
of
his
festivals
and

on

twenty
leopards
and

hundred
bears
gordian
let
loose
three
hundred
african
hyenas
and
ten
indian
tigers
in
the
arena
every
corner
of
the
earth
was
ransacked
for
these
wild
animals
which
were
so
highly
valued
that
in
the
time
of
theodosius
it
was
forbidden
by
law
to
destroy
a
getulian
lion
no
one
can
contemplate
the
statue
of
the
dying
gladiator
which
now
ornaments
the
capitol
at
rome
without
emotions
of
pity
and
admiration
if
a
marble
statue
can
thus
move
us
what
was
it
to
see
the
christian
gladiators
contending
with
the
fierce
lions
of
africa
the
christians
to
the
lions
was
the
cry
of
the
brutal
populace
what
a
sight
was
the
old
amphitheatre
of
titus
five
hundred
and
sixty
feet
long
and
four
hundred
and
seventy
feet
wide
built
on
eighty
arches
and
rising
one
hundred
and
forty
feet
into
the
air
with
its
four
successive
orders
of
architecture
and
enclosing
its
eighty
thousand
seated
spectators
arranged
according
to
rank
from
the
emperor
to
the
lowest
of
the
populace
all
seated
on
marble
benches
covered
with
cushions
and
protected
from
the
sun
and
rain
by
ample
canopies
what
an
excitement
when
men
strove
not
with
wild
beasts
alone
but
with
one
another
and
when
all
that
human
skill
and
strength
increased
by
elaborate
treatment
and
taxed
to
the
uttermost
were
put
forth
in
needless
slaughter
until
the
thirsty
soil
was
wet
and
saturated
with
human
gore
familiarity
with
such
sights
must
have
hardened
the
heart
and
rendered
the
mind
insensible
to
refined
pleasures
what
theatres
are
to
the
french
what
are
to
the
spaniards
what
are
to
the
english
these
gladiatorial
shows
were
to
the
ancient
romans
the
ruins
of
hundreds
of
amphitheatres
attest
the
universality
of
the
custom
not
in
rome
alone
but
in
the
provinces
probably
no
people
abandoned
themselves
to
pleasures
more
universally
than
the
romans
after
war
had
ceased
to
be
their
master
passion
all
classes
alike
pursued
them
with
restless
eagerness
amusements
were
the
fashion
and
the
business
of
life
at
the
theatre
at
the
great
gladiatorial
shows
at
the
chariot
races
emperors
and
senators
and
generals
were
always
present
in
conspicuous
and
reserved
seats
of
honor
behind
them
were
the
patricians
and
then
the
ordinary
citizens
and
in
the
rear
of
these
the
people
fed
at
the
public
expense
the
circus
maximus
the
theatre
of
pompey
the
amphitheatre
of
titus
would
collectively
accommodate
over
four
hundred
thousand
spectators
we
may
presume
that
over
five
hundred
thousand
persons
were
in
the
habit
of
constant
attendance
on
these
demoralizing
sports
and
the
fashion
spread
throughout
all
the
great
cities
of
the
empire
so
that
there
was
scarcely
a
city
of
twenty
thousand
inhabitants
which
had
not
its
theatres
amphitheatres
or
circus
and
when
we
remember
the
heavy
bets
on
favorite
horses
and
the
universal
passion
for
gambling
in
every
shape
we
can
form
some
idea
of
the
effect
of
these
amusements
on
the
common
mind
destroying
the
taste
for
home
pleasures
and
for
all
that
was
intellectual
and
simple
what
are
we
to
think
of
a
state
of
society
where
all
classes
had
continual
leisure
for
these
sports
habits
of
industry
were
destroyed
and
all
respect
for
employments
that
required
labor
the
rich
were
supported
by
contributions
from
the
provinces
since
they
were
the
great
proprietors
of
conquered
lands
the
poor
had
no
solicitude
for
a
living
since
they
were
supported
at
the
public
expense
all
therefore
gave
themselves
up
to
pleasure
even
the
baths
designed
for
sanatory
purposes
became
places
of
resort
and
idleness
and
ultimately
of
intrigue
and
vice
in
the
time
of
julius
caesar
we
find
no
less
a
personage
than
the
mother
of
augustus
making
use
of
the
public
establishments
and
in
process
of
time
the
emperors
themselves
bathed
in
public
with
the
meanest
of
their
subjects
the
baths
in
the
time
of
alexander
severus
were
not
only
kept
open
from
sunrise
to
sunset
but
even
during
the
whole
night
the
luxurious
classes
almost
lived
in
the
baths
commodus
took
his
meals
in
the
bath
gordian
bathed
seven
times
in
the
day
and
gallienus
as
often
they
bathed
before
they
took
their
meals
and
after
meals
to
provoke
a
new
appetite
they
did
not
content
themselves
with
a
single
bath
but
went
through
a
course
of
baths
in
succession
in
which
the
agency
of
air
as
well
as
of
water
was
applied
and
the
bathers
were
attended
by
an
army
of
slaves
given
over
to
every
sort
of
roguery
and
theft
nor
were
water
and
air
baths
alone
used
the
people
made
use
of
scented
oils
to
anoint
their
persons
and
perfumed
the
water
itself
with
the
most
precious
essences
bodily
health
and
cleanliness
were
only
secondary
considerations
voluptuous
pleasure
was
the
main
object
the
ruins
of
the
baths
of
titus
caracalla
and
diocletian
in
rome
show
that
they
were
decorated
with
prodigal
magnificence
and
with
everything
that
could
excite
the
passions
pictures
statues
ornaments
and
mirrors
the
baths
were
scenes
of
orgies
consecrated
to
bacchus
and
the
frescos
on
the
excavated
baths
of
pompeii
still
raise
a
blush
on
the
face
of
every
spectator
who
visits
them
i
speak
not
of
the
elaborate
ornaments
the
numidian
marbles
the
precious
stones
the
exquisite
sculptures
that
formed
part
of
the
decorations
of
the
roman
baths
but
of
the
demoralizing
pleasures
with
which
they
were
connected
and
which
they
tended
to
promote
the
baths
ultimately
became
according
to
the
ancient
writers
places
of
excessive
and
degrading
debauchery
balnea
vina
venus
corrumpunt
corpora
nostra
if
it
were
possible
to
allude
to
an
evil
more
revolting
than
the
sports
of
the
amphitheatre
and
circus
or
the
extravagant
luxuries
of
the
table
i
would
say
that
the
universal
abandonment
to
for
the
enjoyment
of
the
factitious
pleasures
it
purchased
was
even
still
more
melancholy
since
it
struck
deeper
into
the
foundations
which
supported
society
the
leading
spring
of
life
was
money
boys
were
bred
from
early
youth
to
all
the
mysteries
of
unscrupulous
gains
usury
was
practised
to
such
an
incredible
extent
that
the
interest
on
loans
in
some
instances
equalled
in
a
few
months
the
whole
capital
this
was
the
more
aristocratic
mode
of
making
money
which
not
even
senators
disdained
the
pages
of
the
poets
show
how
profoundly
money
was
prized
and
how
miserable
were
people
without
it
rich
old
bachelors
without
heirs
were
held
in
the
supremest
honor
money
was
the
first
object
in
all
matrimonial
alliances
and
provided
that
women
were
only
wealthy
neither
bridegroom
nor
parent
was
fastidious
as
to
age
or
deformity
or
meanness
of
family
or
vulgarity
of
person
the
needy
descendants
of
the
old
patricians
yoked
themselves
with
fortunate
plebeians
and
the
blooming
maidens
of
a
comfortable
obscurity
sold
themselves
without
shame
or
reluctance
to
the
bloated
sensualists
who
could
give
them
what
they
supremely
valued
chariots
and
diamonds
the
giddy
women
in
love
with
ornaments
and
dress
and
the
godless
men
seeking
what
they
should
eat
could
only
be
satisfied
with
what
purchased
their
pleasures
the
haughtiest
aristocracy
ever
known
on
earth
tracing
their
lineage
to
the
times
of
cato
and
boasting
of
their
descent
from
the
scipios
and
the
pompeys
accustomed
themselves
at
last
to
regard
money
as
the
only
test
of
their
own
social
position
the
great
augustine
found
himself
utterly
neglected
at
rome
because
of
his
poverty
being
dependent
on
his
pupils
and
they
being
mean
enough
to
run
away
without
paying
him
literature
languished
and
died
since
it
brought
neither
honor
nor
emolument
no
dignitary
was
respected
for
his
office
only
for
his
gains
nor
was
any
office
prized
which
did
not
bring
rich
emoluments
corruption
was
so
universal
that
an
official
in
an
important
post
was
sure
of
making
a
fortune
in
a
short
time
with
such
an
idolatry
of
money
all
trades
and
professions
which
were
not
favorable
to
its
accumulation
fell
into
disrepute
while
those
who
administered
to
the
pleasures
of
a
rich
man
were
held
in
honor
cooks
buffoons
and
dancers
received
the
consideration
which
artists
and
philosophers
enjoyed
at
athens
in
the
days
of
pericles
but
artists
and
scholars
were
very
few
indeed
in
the
more
degenerate
days
of
the
empire
nor
would
they
have
had
influence
the
wit
of
a
petronius
the
ridicule
of
a
martial
the
bitter
sarcasm
of
a
juvenal
were
lost
on
a
people
abandoned
to
frivolous
gossip
and
demoralizing
excesses
the
haughty
scorn
with
which
a
sensual
beauty
living
on
the
smiles
and
purse
of
a
fortunate
glutton
would
pass
in
her
gilded
chariot
some
of
the
impoverished
descendants
of
the
great
camillus
might
have
provoked
a
smile
had
any
one
been
found
even
a
neglected
poet
to
give
them
countenance
and
sympathy
but
alas
everybody
worshipped
at
the
shrine
of
mammon
everybody
was
valued
for
what
he
rather
than
for
what
he
and
life
was
prized
not
for
those
pleasures
which
are
cheap
and
free
as
heaven
not
for
quiet
tastes
and
rich
affections
and
generous
sympathies
the
glorious
certitudes
of
love
esteem
and
friendship
which
be
they
what
they
may
are
yet
the
of
all
our
day
but
for
the
gratification
of
depraved
and
expensive
tastes
of
those
enjoyments
which
ended
with
the
decay
of
appetite
and
the
of
realized
expectation
all
of
the
earth
earthy
making
a
wreck
of
the
divine
image
which
was
made
for
god
and
heaven
preparing
the
way
for
a
most
fearful
retribution
and
producing
on
contemplative
minds
a
sadness
allied
with
despair
driving
them
to
caves
and
solitudes
and
making
death
the
relief
from
sorrow
the
fourteenth
satire
of
juvenal
is
directed
mainly
to
the
universal
passion
for
gain
and
the
demoralizing
vices
it
brings
in
its
train
which
made
rome
a
vanity
fair
and
even
a
pandemonium
the
old
greek
philosophers
gloried
in
their
poverty
but
poverty
was
the
greatest
reproach
to
a
roman
in
exact
proportion
to
the
sum
of
money
a
man
keeps
in
his
chest
says
juvenal
is
the
credit
given
to
his
oath
and
the
first
question
ever
asked
of
a
man
is
in
reference
to
his
income
rather
than
his
character
how
many
slaves
does
he
keep
how
many
acres
does
he
own
what
dishes
are
his
table
spread
with
these
are
the
universal
inquiries
poverty
bitter
though
it
be
has
no
sharper
sting
than
this
that
it
makes
men
ridiculous
who
was
ever
allowed
at
borne
to
become
a
if
his
estate
was
inferior
what
poor
man
name
appears
in
any
will
and
with
this
reproach
of
poverty
there
were
no
means
to
escape
from
it
nor
was
there
alleviation
a
man
was
regarded
as
a
fool
who
gave
anything
except
to
the
rich
charity
and
benevolence
were
unknown
virtues
the
sick
and
the
miserable
were
left
to
die
unlamented
and
unknown
prosperity
and
success
no
matter
by
what
means
they
were
purchased
secured
reverence
and
influence
such
was
imperial
rome
in
all
the
internal
relations
of
life
and
amid
all
the
trophies
and
praises
which
resulted
from
universal
conquest
a
sad
gloomy
dismal
picture
which
fills
us
with
disgust
as
well
as
melancholy
if
any
one
deems
it
an
exaggeration
he
has
only
to
read
saint
paul
first
chapter
in
his
epistle
to
the
romans
i
can
not
understand
the
enthusiasm
of
gibbon
for
such
a
people
or
for
such
an
empire
a
grinding
and
resistless
imperial
despotism
a
sensual
and
proud
aristocracy
a
debased
and
ignorant
populace
enormously
disproportionate
conditions
of
fortune
slavery
flourishing
to
a
state
unprecedented
in
the
world
history
women
the
victims
and
the

of

lax
sentiments
of

a
whole
people
given
over
to
demoralizing
sports
and
spectacles
pleasure
the
master
passion
of
the
people
money
the
mainspring
of
society
a
universal
indulgence
in
all
the
vices
which
lead
to
violence
and
prepare
the
way
for
the
total
eclipse
of
the
glory
of
man
of
what
value
was
the
cultivation
of
nature
or
a
splendid
material
civilization
or
great

or
an
unrivalled

or
the
triumph
of

when
the
moral

was
completely
undermined
a

therefore
as
fair

as
our

must
needs
crumble
away
there
were
no

the
poison
had
descended
to
the
extremities
of

a
corrupt

with
the
accumulated
vices
of
all
the
nations
of
the
earth
which
they
had
been

for
four
hundred
years
society
must
needs
resolve
itself
into
its
original
elements
when
men
would
not
make
sacrifices
and
so
few

the

to
break
up
at

no

stand
with

an

with

eating
out
the
vitals
of

no
form

however
brilliant
and
lauded
could
arrest
decay
and
ruin
when
public

private
virtue
had
fled
the

the

approaching
catastrophe

good

still
nothing
according

even

the
ruin
it
had
converted
thousands
and
had
sowed
the
seeds
of
future
and
better
civilizations
it
was
sent
however
not
to
save
a
decayed
and
demoralized
empire
but
the

itself
not
until
the
germanic
barbarians
with
their

it

the
strong
grasp

laid
upon
the

of
all
the

see
also
niebuhr
arnold

though
these
writers
have
chiefly
confined
themselves
to
republican
rome
but
if
one
would
get
the
truest
and
most
vivid
description
he
must
read
the
roman

especially
juvenal
and
martial
the

of

is

facts
becker
gallus
is
a
fine
description
of
