introduction
the
object
of
the
present
work
is
to
give
a
brief
and
plain
account
of
the
structure
and
functions
of
the
body
chiefly
with
reference
to
health
and
disease
this
is
intended
to
be
introductory
to
an
account
of
the
constitution
of
the
mind
chiefly
with
reference
to
the
development
and
direction
of
its
powers
there
is
a
natural
connexion
between
these
subjects
and
an
advantage
in
studying
them
in
their
natural
order
structure
must
be
known
before
function
can
be
understood
hence
the
science
of
physiology
is
based
on
that
of
anatomy
the
mind
is
dependent
on
the
body
hence
an
acquaintance
with
the
physiology
of
the
body
should
precede
the
study
of
the
physiology
of
the
mind
the
constitution
of
the
mind
must
be
understood
before
its
powers
and
affections
can
be
properly
developed
and
directed
hence
a
knowledge
of
the
physiology
of
the
mind
is
essential
to
a
sound
view
of
education
and
morals
in
the
execution
of
the
first
part
of
this
work
that
which
relates
to
the
organization
of
the
body
a
formidable
difficulty
presents
itself
at
the
outset
the
explanation
of
structure
is
easy
when
the
part
described
can
be
seen
the
teacher
of
anatomy
finds
no
difficulty
in
communicating
to
the
student
a
clear
and
exact
knowledge
of
the
structure
of
an
organ
because
by
the
aid
of
dissection
he
resolves
the
various
complex
substances
of
which
it
is
built
up
into
their
constituent
parts
and
demonstrates
the
relation
of
these
elementary
parts
to
each
other
but
the
case
is
different
with
him
who
attempts
to
convey
a
knowledge
of
the
structure
of
an
organ
merely
by
the
description
of
it
the
best
conceived
and
executed
drawing
is
a
most
inadequate
substitute
for
the
object
itself
it
is
impossible
wholly
to
remove
this
difficulty
what
can
be
done
by
the
aid
of
plates
to
lessen
it
is
here
attempted
a
time
may
come
when
the
objects
themselves
will
be
more
generally
accessible
meanwhile
the
description
now
given
of
the
chief
organs
of
the
body
may
facilitate
the
study
of
their
structure
to
those
who
have
an
opportunity
of
examining
the
organs
themselves
and
will
it
is
hoped
enable
every
reader
at
once
to
understand
much
of
their
action
physical
science
has
become
the
subject
of
popular
attention
and
men
of
the
highest
endowments
who
have
devoted
their
lives
to
the
cultivation
of
this
department
of
knowledge
conceive
that
they
can
make
no
better
use
of
the
treasures
they
have
accumulated
than
that
of
diffusing
them
of
this
part
of
the
great
field
of
knowledge
to
make
the
rough
places
plain
and
the
crooked
places
straight
is
deemed
a
labour
second
in
importance
only
to
that
of
extending
the
boundaries
of
the
field
itself
but
no
attempt
has
hitherto
been
made
to
exhibit
a
clear
and
comprehensive
view
of
the
phenomena
of
life
the
organization
upon
which
those
phenomena
depend
the
physical
agents
essential
to
their
production
and
the
laws
as
far
as
they
have
yet
been
discovered
according
to
which
those
agents
act
the
consequence
is
that
people
in
general
not
excepting
the
educated
class
are
wholly
ignorant
of
the
structure
and
action
of
the
organs
of
their
own
bodies
the
circumstances
which
are
conducive
to
their
own
health
the
agents
which
ordinarily
produce
disease
and
the
means
by
which
the
operation
of
such
agents
may
be
avoided
or
counteracted
and
they
can
hardly
be
said
to
possess
more
information
relative
to
the
connexion
between
the
organization
of
the
body
and
the
qualities
of
the
mind
the
physical
condition
and
the
mental
state
the
laws
which
regulate
the
production
combination
and
succession
of
the
trains
of
pleasurable
and
painful
thought
and
the
rules
deducible
from
those
laws
having
for
their
object
such
a
determination
of
voluntary
human
conduct
as
may
secure
the
pleasurable
and
avoid
the
painful
yet
nothing
would
seem
a
fitter
study
for
man
than
the
nature
of
man
in
this
sense
of
the
term
a
knowledge
of
the
structure
and
functions
of
the
body
is
admitted
to
be
indispensable
to
whoever
undertakes
as
the
business
of
his
profession
to
protect
those
organs
from
injury
and
to
restore
their
action
to
a
sound
state
when
it
has
become
disordered
but
surely
some
knowledge
of
this
kind
may
be
useful
to
those
who
have
no
intention
to
practise
physic
or
to
perform
operations
in
surgery
may
be
useful
to
every
human
being
to
enable
him
to
take
a
rational
care
of
his
health
to
make
him
observant
of
his
own
altered
sensations
as
indications
of
approaching
sickness
to
give
him
the
power
of
communicating
intelligibly
with
his
medical
adviser
respecting
the
seat
and
the
succession
of
those
signs
of
disordered
function
and
to
dispose
and
qualify
him
to
with
his
physician
in
the
use
of
the
means
employed
to
avert
impending
danger
or
to
remove
actual
disease
but
if
to
every
human
being
occasions
must
continually
occur
when
knowledge
of
this
kind
would
be
useful
the
possession
of
it
seems
peculiarly
necessary
to
those
who
have
the
exclusive
care
of
infancy
almost
the
entire
care
of
childhood
a
great
part
of
the
care
of
the
sick
and
whose
ignorance
not
the
less
mischievous
because
its
activity
is
induced
by
affection
constantly
endangers
and
often
defeats
the
best
concerted
measures
of
the
physician
the
bodily
organization
and
the
mental
powers
of
the
child
depend
mainly
on
the
management
of
the
infant
and
the
intellectual
and
moral
aptitudes
and
qualities
of
the
man
have
their
origin
in
the
predominant
states
of
sensation
at
a
period
far
earlier
in
the
history
of
the
human
being
than
is
commonly
imagined
the
period
of
infancy
is
divided
by
physiologists
into
two
epochs
the
first
commencing
from
birth
extends
to
the
seventh
month
the
second
commencing
from
the
seventh
month
extends
to
the
end
of
the
second
year
at
which
time
the
period
of
infancy
ceases
and
that
of
childhood
begins
the
first
epoch
of
infancy
is
remarkable
for
the
rapidity
of
the
development
of
the
organs
of
the
body
the
processes
of
growth
are
in
extreme
activity
the
formative
predominates
over
the
sentient
life
the
chief
object
of
the
action
of
the
former
being
to
prepare
the
apparatus
of
the
latter
the
second
epoch
of
infancy
is
remarkable
for
the
development
of
the
perceptive
powers
the
physical
organization
of
the
brain
which
still
advances
with
rapidity
is
now
capable
of
a
greater
energy
and
a
wider
range
of
function
sensation
becomes
more
exact
and
varied
the
intellectual
faculties
are
in
almost
constant
operation
speech
commences
the
sign
and
to
a
certain
extent
the
cause
of
the
growing
strength
of
the
mental
powers
the
capacity
of
voluntary
locomotion
is
acquired
while
passion
emotion
affection
come
into
play
with
such
constancy
and
energy
as
to
exert
over
the
whole
economy
of
the
now
irritable
and
plastic
creature
a
prodigious
influence
for
good
or
evil
if
it
be
indeed
possible
to
make
correct
moral
perception
feeling
and
conduct
a
part
of
human
nature
as
much
a
part
of
it
as
any
sensation
or
this
be
possible
for
every
individual
of
the
human
race
without
exception
to
an
extent
which
would
render
more
eminently
and
consistently
virtuous
than
are
at
present
and
of
the
possibility
of
this
the
conviction
is
the
strongest
in
the
acutest
minds
which
have
studied
this
subject
the
most
profoundly
preparation
for
the
accomplishment
of
this
object
must
be
commenced
at
this
epoch
but
if
preparation
for
this
object
be
really
commenced
it
implies
on
the
part
of
those
who
engage
in
the
undertaking
some
degree
of
knowledge
knowledge
of
the
physical
and
mental
constitution
of
the
individual
to
be
influenced
knowledge
of
the
mode
in
which
circumstances
must
be
so
modified
in
adaptation
to
the
nature
of
the
individual
being
as
to
produce
upon
it
with
uniformity
and
certainty
a
given
result
the
theory
of
human
society
according
to
its
present
institutions
supposes
that
this
knowledge
is
possessed
by
the
mother
and
it
supposes
further
that
this
adaptation
will
actually
take
place
in
the
domestic
circle
through
her
agency
hence
the
presumed
advantage
of
having
the
eye
of
the
mother
always
upon
the
child
hence
the
apprehension
of
evil
so
general
i
had
almost
said
instinctive
whenever
it
is
proposed
to
take
the
infant
for
the
purpose
of
systematic
physical
and
mental
discipline
from
beyond
the
sphere
of
maternal
influence
but
society
which
thus
presumes
that
the
mother
will
possess
the
power
and
the
disposition
to
do
this
what
expedients
has
it
devised
to
endow
her
with
the
former
and
to
secure
the
formation
of
the
latter
i
appeal
to
every
woman
whose
eye
may
rest
on
these
pages
i
ask
of
you
what
has
ever
been
done
for
you
to
enable
you
to
understand
the
physical
and
mental
constitution
of
that
human
nature
the
care
of
which
is
imposed
upon
you
in
what
part
of
the
course
of
your
education
was
instruction
of
this
kind
introduced
over
how
large
a
portion
of
your
education
did
it
extend
who
were
your
teachers
what
have
you
profited
by
their
lessons
what
progress
have
you
made
in
the
acquisition
of
the
requisite
information
were
you
at
this
moment
to
undertake
the
guidance
of
a
infant
to
health
knowledge
goodness
and
happiness
how
would
you
set
about
the
task
how
would
you
regulate
the
influence
of
external
agents
upon
its
delicate
tender
and
organs
in
such
a
manner
as
to
obtain
from
them
healthful
stimulation
and
avoid
destructive
excitement
what
natural
and
moral
objects
would
you
select
as
the
best
adapted
to
exercise
and
develope
its
opening
faculties
what
feelings
would
you
check
and
what
cherish
how
would
you
excite
aims
how
would
you
apply
motives
how
would
you
avail
yourself
of
pleasure
as
a
final
end
or
as
the
means
to
some
further
end
and
how
would
you
deal
with
the
no
less
formidable
instrument
of
pain
what
is
your
own
physical
intellectual
and
moral
state
as
specially
fitting
you
for
this
office
what
is
the
measure
of
your
own
without
a
large
portion
of
which
no
human
being
ever
yet
exerted
over
the
infant
mind
any
considerable
influence
for
good
there
is
no
philosopher
however
profound
his
knowledge
no
instructor
however
varied
and
extended
his
experience
who
would
not
enter
upon
this
task
with
an
apprehension
proportioned
to
his
knowledge
and
experience
but
knowledge
which
men
acquire
only
after
years
of
study
habits
which
are
generated
in
men
only
as
the
result
of
discipline
are
expected
to
come
to
you
spontaneously
to
be
born
with
you
to
require
on
your
part
no
culture
and
to
need
no
sustaining
influence
but
indeed
it
is
a
most
inadequate
expression
of
the
fact
to
say
that
the
communication
of
the
knowledge
and
the
formation
of
the
habits
which
are
necessary
to
the
due
performance
of
the
duties
of
women
constitute
no
essential
part
of
their
education
the
direct
tendency
of
a
great
part
of
their
education
is
to
produce
and
foster
opinions
feelings
and
tastes
which
positively
disqualify
them
for
the
performance
of
their
duties
all
would
be
well
if
the
marriage
ceremony
which
transforms
the
girl
into
the
wife
conferred
upon
the
wife
the
qualities
which
should
be
possessed
by
the
mother
but
it
is
rare
to
find
a
person
capable
of
the
least
difficult
part
of
education
namely
that
of
communicating
instruction
even
after
diligent
study
with
a
direct
view
to
teaching
yet
an
ordinary
girl
brought
up
in
the
ordinary
mode
in
the
ordinary
domestic
circle
is
intrusted
with
the
direction
and
control
of
the
first
impressions
that
are
made
upon
the
human
being
and
the
momentous
physical
intellectual
and
moral
results
that
arise
out
of
those
impressions
i
am
sensible
of
the
total
inadequacy
of
any
remedy
for
this
evil
short
of
a
modification
of
our
domestic
institutions
mere
information
however
complete
the
communication
of
it
can
do
little
beyond
affording
a
clearer
conception
of
the
end
in
view
and
of
the
means
fitted
to
secure
it
even
this
little
however
would
be
something
gained
and
the
hope
of
contributing
in
some
degree
to
the
furtherance
of
this
object
has
supplied
one
of
the
main
motives
for
undertaking
the
present
work
meantime
women
are
the
earliest
teachers
they
must
be
nurses
they
can
be
neither
without
the
risk
of
doing
incalculable
mischief
unless
they
have
some
understanding
of
the
subjects
about
to
be
treated
of
on
these
grounds
i
rest
their
to
study
them
and
i
look
upon
that
notion
of
delicacy
which
would
exclude
them
from
knowledge
calculated
in
an
extraordinary
degree
to
open
exalt
and
purify
their
minds
and
to
fit
them
for
the
performance
of
their
duties
as
alike
degrading
to
those
to
whom
it
affects
to
show
respect
and
debasing
to
the
mind
that
entertains
it
though
each
part
of
this
work
will
be
made
as
complete
in
itself
as
the
author
is
capable
of
rendering
it
and
to
that
extent
independent
of
any
other
part
yet
there
will
be
found
to
be
a
strict
connexion
between
the
several
portions
of
the
whole
and
greatly
as
the
topics
included
in
the
latter
differ
from
those
which
form
the
earlier
subjects
the
advantage
of
having
studied
the
former
before
the
latter
are
entered
on
will
be
felt
precisely
as
the
word
can
be
justly
applied
to
the
operation
of
the
mind
on
such
matters
in
the
expository
portion
of
the
work
i
have
not
been
anxious
to
abstain
from
the
employment
of
technical
terms
when
a
decidedly
useful
purpose
was
to
be
obtained
by
the
introduction
of
them
but
i
have
been
very
careful
to
use
no
such
term
without
assigning
the
exact
meaning
of
it
a
technical
term
unexplained
is
a
dark
spot
on
the

it
is

the

of
health

disease
an
acquaintance
with
the
nature
of
organization

of
the

for
this
reason
that
the
exposition
of

and

attempted
in
this

part
of

work
is
somewhat
full

there
can
not
be
a
question
that
if

it
will
not
only
enable
the
account
of

in
the

part
of
it
to

i
characters
by
which
living
beings
are
distinguished
from
inorganic
by
which
animals
are
distinguished
from
common
to
plants
and
peculiar
to
included
in
the
organic
included
in
the
animal
and
functions
of
physical
agents
on
organized
of
supply
and
processes
of
why
the
structure
of
the
animal
is
more
complex
than
that
of
the
plant
the
distinction
between
a
living
being
and
an
inorganic
body
between
a
plant
and
a
stone
is
that
the
plant
carries
on
a
number
of
processes
which
are
not
performed
by
the
stone
the
plant
absorbs
food
converts
its
food
into
its
own
proper
substance
arranges
this
substance
into
bark
wood
vessels
leaves
and
other
organized
structures
grows
arrives
at
maturity
and
decays
generates
and
maintains
a
certain
degree
of
heat
derives
from
a
parent
the
primary
structure
and
the
first
impulse
upon
which
these
varied
actions
depend
gives
origin
to
a
new
being
similar
to
itself
and
after
a
certain
time
terminates
its
existence
in
death
no
such
phenomena
are
exhibited
by
the
stone
it
neither
absorbs
food
nor
arranges
the
matter
of
which
it
is
composed
into
organized
structure
nor
grows
nor
decays
nor
generates
heat
nor
derives
its
existence
from
a
parent
nor
gives
origin
to
a
new
being
nor
dies
nothing
analogous
to
the
processes
by
which
these
results
are
produced
is
observable
in
any
body
that
is
destitute
of
life
all
of
them
are
carried
on
by
every
living
creature
these
processes
are
therefore
denominated
vital
and
being
peculiar
to
the
state
of
life
they
afford
characters
by
which
the
living
being
is
distinguished
from
the
inorganic
body
in
like
manner
the
distinction
between
an
animal
and
a
plant
is
that
the
animal
possesses
properties
of
which
the
plant
is
destitute
it
is
endowed
with
two
new
and
superior
powers
to
which
there
is
nothing
analogous
in
the
plant
namely
the
power
of
sensation
and
the
power
of
voluntary
motion
the
capacity
of
feeling
and
the
capacity
of
moving
from
place
to
place
as
its
feeling
prompts
the
animal
like
the
plant
receives
food
transforms
its
food
into
its
own
proper
substance
builds
this
substance
up
into
structure
generates
and
maintains
a
certain
temperature
derives
its
existence
from
a
parent
produces
an
offspring
like
itself
and
terminates
its
existence
in
death
up
to
this
point
the
vital
phenomena
exhibited
by
both
orders
of
living
creatures
are
alike
but
at
this
point
the
vital
processes
of
the
plant
terminate
while
those
of
the
animal
are
extended
and
exalted
by
the
exercise
of
the
distinct
and
superior
endowments
of
sensation
and
voluntary
motion
to
feel
and
to
move
spontaneously
in
accordance
with
that
feeling
are
properties
possessed
by
the
animal
but
not
by
the
plant
and
therefore
these
properties
afford
characters
by
which
the
animal
is
distinguished
from
the
plant
the
two
great
classes
of
living
beings
perform
then
two
distinct
sets
of
actions
the
first
set
is
common
to
all
living
creatures
the
second
is
peculiar
to
one
class
the
first
set
is
indispensable
to
life
the
second
is
necessary
only
to
one
kind
of
life
namely
the
animal
the
actions
included
in
the
first
set
being
common
to
all
living
or
organized
creatures
are
called
organic
the
actions
included
in
the
second
class
belonging
only
to
one
part
of
living
or
organized
creatures
namely
animals
are
called
animal
the
organic
actions
consist
of
the
processes
by
which
the
existence
of
the
living
being
is
maintained
and
the
perpetuation
of
its
species
secured
the
animal
actions
consist
of
the
processes
by
which
the
living
being
is
rendered
percipient
and
capable
of
spontaneous
motion
the
organic
processes
comprehend
those
of
nutrition
respiration
circulation
secretion
excretion
and
reproduction
the
first
five
relate
to
the
maintenance
of
the
life
of
the
individual
being
the
last
to
the
perpetuation
of
its
species
the
animal
processes
comprehend
those
of
sensation
and
of
voluntary
motion
often
denominated
processes
of
relation
because
they
put
the
individual
being
in
communication
with
the
external
world
there
is
no
vital
action
performed
by
any
living
creature
which
may
not
be
included
in
one
or
other
of
these
processes
or
in
some
modification
of
some
one
of
them
there
is
no
action
performed
by
any
inorganic
body
which
possesses
even
a
remote
analogy
to
either
of
these
vital
processes
the
line
of
demarcation
between
the
organic
and
the
inorganic
world
is
therefore
clear
and
broad
and
the
line
of
demarcation
between
the
two
great
divisions
of
the
organic
world
between
the
inanimate
and
the
animate
that
is
between
plants
and
animals
is
no
less
decided
for
of
the
two
sets
of
actions
which
have
been
enumerated
the
one
as
has
just
been
stated
is
common
to
the
whole
class
of
living
beings
while
the
second
set
is
peculiar
to
one
division
of
that
class
the
plant
performs
only
the
organic
actions
all
the
vital
phenomena
it
exhibits
are
included
in
this
single
circle
it
is
therefore
said
to
possess
only
organic
life
but
the
animal
performs
both
organic
and
animal
actions
and
is
therefore
said
to
possess
both
organic
and
animal
life
both
the
organic
and
the
animal
actions
are
accomplished
by
means
of
certain
instruments
that
is
organized
bodies
which
possess
a
definite
structure
and
which
are
moulded
into
a
peculiar
form
such
an
instrument
is
called
an
organ
and
the
action
of
an
organ
is
called
its
function
the
leaf
of
the
plant
is
an
organ
and
the
conversion
of
sap
by
the
leaf
into
the
proper
juice
of
the
plant
by
the
process
called
respiration
is
the
function
of
this
organ
the
liver
of
the
animal
is
an
organ
and
the
conversion
of
the
blood
that
circulates
through
it
into
bile
by
the
process
of
secretion
is
its
function
the
brain
is
an
organ
the
sentient
nerve
in
communication
with
it
is
also
an
organ
the
extremity
of
the
sentient
nerve
receives
an
impression
from
an
external
object
and
conveys
it
to
the
brain
where
it
becomes
a
sensation
the
transmission
of
the
impression
is
the
function
of
the
nerve
the
conversion
of
the
impression
into
a
sensation
is
the
function
of
the
brain
the
living
body
consists
of
a
congeries
of
these
instruments
or
organs
the
constituent
matter
of
these
organs
is
always
partly
in
a
fluid
and
partly
in
a
solid
state
of
the
fluids
and
solids
which
thus
invariably
enter
in
combination
into
the
composition
of
the
organs
the
fluids
may
be
regarded
as
the
primary
and
essential
elements
for
they
are
the
source
and
the
support
of
the
solids
there
is
no
solid
which
is
not
formed
out
of
a
fluid
no
solid
which
does
not
always
contain
as
a
constituent
part
of
it
some
fluid
and
none
which
is
capable
of
maintaining
its
integrity
without
a
continual
supply
of
fluids
whatever
be
the
intimate
composition
of
the
fluids
out
of
which
the
solids
are
formed
the
investigation
of
which
is
more
difficult
than
that
of
the
solids
and
the
nature
of
which
is
therefore
less
clearly
ascertained
it
is
certain
that
all
the
matter
which
enters
into
the
composition
of
the
solid
is
disposed
in
a
definite
order
it
is
this
disposition
of
the
constituent
matter
of
the
living
solid
in
a
definite
order
that
constitutes
the
arrangement
so
characteristic
of
all
living
substance
definite
arrangements
are
combined
in
definite
modes
and
the
result
is
what
is
termed
organization
from
varied
arrangements
result
different
kinds
of
organized
substances
each
endowed
with
different
properties
and
exhibiting
peculiar
characters
by
the
recombination
of
these
several
kinds
of
organized
substances
in
different
proportions
and
different
modes
are
formed
the
special
instruments
or
organs
of
which
we
have
just
spoken
while
it
is
the
combining
or
the
building
up
of
these
different
organized
substances
into
organs
that
constitutes
structure
in
the
living
body
not
only
is
each
distinct
organ
alive
but
with
exceptions
so
slight
that
they
need
not
be
noticed
here
every
solid
which
enters
into
the
composition
of
the
organ
is
endowed
with
vital
properties
this
is
probably
the
case
with
the
primary
substances
or
tissues
which
compose
the
several
organs
of
the
plant
but
that
the
animal
solids
are
alive
is
indubitable
nay
the
evidence
is
complete
that
many
even
of
the
animal
fluids
possess
vitality
the
blood
in
the
animal
is
as
truly
alive
as
the
brain
and
the
bone
as
the
flesh
the
organized
body
considered
as
a
whole
is
the
seat
of
life
but
life
also
resides
in
almost
every
component
part
of
it
yet
the
matter
out
of
which
these
living
substances
is
formed
is
not
alive
by
processes
of
which
we
know
nothing
or
at
least
of
which
we
see
only
the
first
steps
wholly
destitute
of
life
is
converted
into
living
substance
the
inorganic
matter
which
is
the
subject
of
this
wonderful
transformation
is
resolvable
into
a
very
few
elementary
substances
in
the
plant
these
substances
consist
of
three
only
namely
oxygen
hydrogen
and
carbon
the
first
two
are
aëriform
or
gaseous
bodies
the
last
is
a
solid
substance
and
it
is
of
this
that
the
plant
is
chiefly
composed
hence
the
basis
of
the
plant
is
a
solid
the
elementary
bodies
into
which
all
animal
substance
is
resolvable
are
four
namely
azote
oxygen
hydrogen
and
carbon
into
every
animal
fluid
and
solid
this
new
substance
azote
enters
so
largely
that
it
may
be
considered
as
the
fundamental
and
distinctive
element
of
the
animal
organization
hence
the
basis
of
the
animal
is
an
aëriform
or
gaseous
fluid
the
animal
is
composed
of
air
the
plant
of
solid
matter
and
this
difference
in
their
elementary
nature
gives
origin
to
several
distinctive
characters
between
the
plant
and
the
animal
in
addition
to
those
which
have
been
already
stated
thus
the
characters
of
the
plant
are
solidity
hardness
fixedness
and
durability
while
the
animal
is
comparatively
fluid
soft
volatile
and
perishable
and
the
reason
is
now
manifest
the
basis
of
the
animal
being
an
aëriform
fluid
its
consistence
is
softer
than
that
of
the
plant
the
basis
of
which
is
a
firm
solid
and
at
the
same
time
the
component
elements
of
the
animal
being
more
numerous
than
those
of
the
plant
and
the
fluidity
of
these
elements
and
of
the
compounds
they
form
greatly
favouring
their
action
and
reaction
on
each
other
and
on
external
agents
the
animal
body
is
more
volatile
and
perishable
during
life
and
more
readily
decomposed
after
death
it
has
been
stated
that
the
object
of
every
structure
or
organ
of
the
living
body
is
the
performance
of
some
special
action
or
function
ultimate
object
of
the
fluids
being
the
production
of
the
solids
the
ultimate
object
of
the
solids
being
the
formation
of
organs
the
ultimate
object
of
organs
being
the
performance
of
actions
or
functions
while
it
is
in
the
performance
of
actions
or
functions
that
life
consists
functions
carried
on
by
organs
organs
in
action
special
organs
performing
definite
actions
this
it
is
that
constitutes
the
state
of
life
every
particle
of
matter
which
enters
into
the
composition
of
the
living
body
has
thus
its
own
place
forming
or
destined
to
form
a
constituent
part
of
some
organ
every
organ
has
its
own
action
all
the
organs
of
the
body
form
the
body
and
all
the
actions
of
all
the
organs
constitute
the
aggregate
of
the
vital
phenomena
every
organ
is
excited
to
action
or
its
function
is
called
into
operation
by
means
of
some
external
body
the
external
bodies
capable
of
exciting
and
maintaining
the
functions
of
living
organs
consist
of
a
definite
class
because
these
bodies
belong
to
that
department
of
science
which
is
called
physical
they
are
termed
physical
agents
they
are
air
water
heat
cold
electricity
and
light
without
the
living
organ
the
physical
agent
can
excite
no
vital
action
without
the
physical
agent
the
living
organ
can
carry
on
no
vital
process
the
plant
can
not
perform
the
vital
process
of
respiration
without
the
leaf
nor
with
the
leaf
without
air
the
physical
agent
acts
upon
the
living
organ
the
living
organ
reacts
upon
the
physical
agent
and
the
action
between
both
is
definite
in
the
lung
of
the
animal
a
certain
principle
of
the
air
unites
in
definite
proportions
with
a
certain
principle
of
the
blood
the
oxygen
of
the
air
combines
with
the
carbon
of
the

the

is
changed
by
the
abstraction
of
its
oxygen
the

it

by
the
action
of
the

changed
into

by
the
union
of
a

quantity
of

it

into

into

by
giving
to
the

carbon
and
by
receiving
from
the

oxygen
in
this
manner
the
change
in
the
physical
agent
is
definite
and
uniform
and
the
change
in
the
living
substance
is
equally
definite
and
uniform
it
is
this
determinate
interchange
of
action
between
the
living
organ
and
the
physical
agent
that
constitutes
what
is
termed
a
vital
process
all
vital
processes
are
carried
on
by
living

the
materials
employed
in
all
vital

are
physical

the

themselves
are
vital

all

all
the

range
of

performed
by
this

during
the

which
thus

goes
on

the

are
brought
under
the
influence
of
a

superior
agency
with
the

of
which
we
are
imperfectly
acquainted
but
the
operation
of
which
we
see
and
which
we
call
the
agency
of
life
air

are
physical

intimate

by
which
these

are
wrought
in

of
all
the
phenomena
included
in
that
circle
of

which
we
designate
by
the
general
term
life
this
power
of
resisting
the
effects
universally
produced
by
physical
agents
on
inorganic

and
of
bringing
these
very
agents
under
subjection
to
a
new

all

processes
of

or
processes
of
waste
by
every
vital
action
performed
by
the
organized
body
some
portion
of
its
constituent

is
expended
numerous
vital
actions
are
constantly
carried
on
for
the
sole
purpose
of
compensating
this
expenditure
every

are
carried
out
of

every

new

are
introduced
into

the
matter
of
which
the
organized
and
more
especially
the
animal
body
is
composed
is
thus
in
a
state
of
perpetual
flux
and
in
a
certain
space
of
time
it
is
completely
changed
so
that
of
all
the
matter
that
constitutes
the
animal
body
at
a

point
of

not
a
single
particle
remains
at
another
point
of

at

all
the
wants
of
the

of
the

are
satisfied
by
a

of

water
heat
cold
electricity
and
light
some
of
these
physical
agents
constitute
the
crude
aliment
of
the
plant
others
produce
in
this
aliment
a
series
of
changes
by
which
it
is
converted
from
crude
aliment
into
proper
nutriment
while
others
act
as
stimulants
by
which

are
excited
the
ultimate
object
of
which
is
the
distribution
of
the

to
the
various
parts
of
the

of
the
plant
the
same
physical
agents
are
indispensable
to
the
support
of
the
animal
body
but
the
animal
can
not
be
sustained
by
these
physical
agents
alone
for
the
maintenance
of
animal
life
in
some
shape
or
other
vegetable
or
animal
matter
or
both
in
a
certain
state
of
combination
must
be
superadded
hence
another
distinction
between
the
plant
and
the
animal
necessity
on
the
part
of
the
animal
of
an
elaborated
aliment
to
maintain
its
existence
by
the
vital
processes
of
its
economy
the
plant
converts
inorganic
into
organic
matter
by
the
vital
processes
of
its
economy
the
animal
converts
matter
already
rendered
organic
into
its
own
proper
substance
the
plant
is
thus
purveyor
to
the
animal
but
it
is
more
than
purveyor
to
it
for
while
it
provides
it
also
prepares
its
food
it
saves
the
animal
one
process
that
of
the
transmutation
of
inorganic
into
organic
matter
the
ultimate
end
or
the
final
cause
of
the
vital
processes
performed
by
the
first
class
of
living
beings
is
thus
the
elaboration
of
aliment
for
the
second
the
inferior
life
is
spent
in
ministering
and
the
great
object
of
its
being
is
to
minister
to
the
existence
of
the
superior
at
the
point
at
which
organization
commences
structure
is
so
simple
that
there
is
no
manifest
distinction
of
organs
several
functions
are
performed
apparently
by
one
single
organized
substance
the
lowest
plants
and
the
lowest
animals
are
equally
without
any
separate
organs
as
far
as
it
is
in
our
power
to
distinguish
them
for
carrying
on
the
vital
actions
they
perform
an
organized
tissue
apparently
of
an
homogeneous
nature
containing
fluid
matter
is
all
that
can
be
made
out
by
which
the
most
plant
carries
on
its
single
set
and
by
which
the
most
animal
carries
on
its
double
set
of
actions
but
this
simplicity
of
structure
exists
only
at
the
very
commencement
of
the
organized
world
every
advancement
in
the
scale
of
organization
is
indicated
by
the
construction
of
organs
manifestly
separate
for
the
performance
of
individual
functions
and
invariably
the
higher
the
being
the
more
complete
is
this
separation
of
function
from
function
and
consequently
the
greater
the
multiplication
of
organs
and
the
more
elaborate
and
complex
the
structure
hence
another
distinction
between
the
plant
and
the
animal
the
simplicity
of
the
structure
of
the
plant
is
in
striking
contrast
to
the
complexity
of
the
structure
of
the
animal
and
this
difference
is
not
arbitrary
it
is
a
matter
of
absolute
necessity
and
the
reason
of
this
necessity
it
will
be
instructive
to
contemplate
the
plant
as
has
been
shown
performs
only
one
set
of
functions
the
organic
while
the
animal
performs
two
sets
of
functions
the
organic
and
the
animal
the
animal
then
performs
more
functions
than
the
plant
and
functions
of
a
higher
order
it
carries
on
its
functions
with
a
greater
degree
of
energy
its
functions
have
a
more
extended
range
and
all
its
functions
bear
a
certain
relation
to
each
other
maintaining
an
harmonious
action
the
number
the
superiority
the
relation
the
range
and
the
energy
of
the
functions
performed
by
the
animal
are
then
so
many
conditions
which
render
it
absolutely
indispensable
that
it
should
possess
a
greater
complexity
of
structure
than
the
plant
to
build
up
structure
is
to
create
to
arrange
and
to
connect
organs
organs
are
the
instruments
by
which
functions
are
performed
and
without
the
instrument
there
can
be
no
action
with
as
many
more
organs
than
the
plant
possesses
the
animal
must
therefore
be
provided
as
are
necessary
to
carry
on
the
additional
functions
it
performs
organs
for
its
organic
functions
it
must
have
as
well
as
the
plant
but
to
these
must
be
superadded
organs
of
another
class
for
which
the
plant
has
no
need
namely
organs
for
its
animal
functions
two
sets
of
organs
must
therefore
be
provided
for
the
animal
while
the
plant
requires
but
one
some
functions
performed
by
the
animal
are
of
a
higher
order
than
any
performed
by
the
plant
and
the
superior
function
requires
a
higher
organization
the
construction
of
an
organ
is
complex
as
its
action
is
elevated
the
instrument
is
elaborately
prepared
in
proportion
to
the
nobleness
of
its
office

fig

but
this
is
not
all
for
the
addition
of
a
superior
function
requires
not
only
the
addition
of
an
organ
having
a
corresponding
superiority
of
structure
but
it
requires
further
that
a
certain
elevation
of
structure
should
be
communicated
to
all
the
organs
of
all
the
inferior
functions
on
account
of
the
relation
which
it
is
necessary
to
establish
between
function
and
function
unless
the
organ
of
an
inferior
function
be
constructed
with
a
perfection
corresponding
to
that
of
the
organ
of
a
superior
function
the
inferior
will
be
incapable
of
working
in
harmony
with
the
superior
take
for
example
the
inferior
function
of
nutrition
nutrition
is
an
organic
function
equally
necessary
to
the
plant
and
to
the
animal
and
requiring
in
both
organs
for
performing
it
but
this
function
can
not
be
performed
in
the
animal
by
organs
as
simple
as
suffice
for
the
plant
nutrition
in
the
plant
is
carried
on
in
the
following
mode
root
of
the
plant
is
divided
like
the
trunk
into
numerous
branches
fig
i
these
branches
divide
and
subdivide
into
smaller
and
smaller
branches
until
at
last
they
reach
an
extreme
degree
of
minuteness
fig
i
the
smallest
of
these
divisions
called
from
their
tenuity
fig
i
are
provided
with
a
peculiar
structure
which
is
endowed
with
a
specific
function
in
most
plants
this
peculiar
structure
is
found
at
the
terminal
point
of
the
rootlet
fig
i
but
in
some
plants
the
capillary
branches
of
the
rootlets
are
provided
with
distinct
bodies
fig
ii
scarcely
to
be
discerned
when
the
root
has
been
removed
some
time
from
the
soil
and
has
become
dry
fig

but
which
in
a
few
minutes
after
the
root
has
been
plunged
in
water
provided
the
plant

still
alive
become
turgid
with
fluid
and
consequently
distinctly
visible
fig

these
bodies
when
they
exist
or
the
terminal
point
of
the
rootlet
when
these
bodies
are
absent
are
termed
or
spongeoles
and
the
structure
and
function
of
the
organ
in
both
cases
are
conceived
to
be
precisely
the
same
in
both
the
organ
consists
of
a
minute
cellular
structure
fig
iii
shows
this
structure
as
it
appears
when
the
object
is
magnified
the
office
of
this
organ
is
to
absorb
the
aliment
of
the
plant
from
the
soil
and
so
great
is
its
absorbing
power
that
as
is
proved
by
direct
experiment
it
absorbs
the
colouring
molecules
of
liquids
though
these
molecules
will
not
enter
the
ordinary
pores
which
are
of
much
greater
magnitude
with
the
spongeoles
are
connected
vessels
which
pass
through
the
substance
of
the
stem
or
trunk
to
the
leaf
fig

shows
these
tubes
springing
from
the
cellular
structure
of
the
spongeole
and
passing
up
to
the
stem

a

figs

and

these

spread

ramifying
through
the

the
crude
aliment
borne
by
these
tubes
to
the
leaf
is
there
converted
into
proper
nutriment
and
from
the
leaf
when
duly
elaborated
this
proper
nutriment
is
carried
out
by
ducts
to
the
various
organs
of
the
plant
in
order
to
supply
them
with
the
aliment
they
need
illustration

now
for
carrying
on
the
process
of
nutrition
in
this
mode
there
must
be
organs

crude

organs
to
convey
the
crude
aliment

which
it
is
converted

finally
organs
for
carrying
out
this
proper
nutriment
to
the
system
complication
of
structure
to
this
extent
is
indispensable
and
accordingly
with
spongeolæ
with
with
leaves
with
distributive
ducts
the
plant
is
provided
without
all
the
parts
of
this
apparatus
it
could
not
carry
on
its
function
any
further
complication
would
be
useless
illustration
fig

but
suppose
a
new
and
superior
function
to
be
added
to
the
plant
suppose
it
to
be
endowed
with
the
power
of
locomotion
what
would
be
the
consequence
of
communicating
to
it
this
higher
power
that
its
former
state
of
simplicity
would
no
longer
suffice
for
the
inferior
function
why
because
the
exercise
of
the
superior
would
interrupt
the
action
of
the
inferior
function
nutrition
by
imbibition
and
the
exercise
of
locomotion
can
not
go
on
simultaneously
in
the
same
being
the
plant
is
fixed
in
the
soil
by
its
roots
and
from
this
its
state
of
immobility
results
this
most
important
consequence
that
its
spongeolæ
are
always
in
contact
with
its
food
illustration
fig

illustration
fig

but
we
may
imagine
a
plant
not
fixed
to
the
soil
a
plant
so
constituted
as
to
be
capable
of
moving
from
place
to
place
such
a
plant
would
not
be
always
in
contact
with
its
food
and
therefore
as
it
exercised
its
faculty
of
locomotion
it
could
not
but
interrupt
or
suspend
its
function
of
nutrition
in
a
being
capable
of
carrying
on
these
two
functions
simultaneously
the
entire
apparatus
of
the
function
of
nutrition
must
then
be
modified
instead
of
having
spongeolæ
fixed
immovably
in
the
earth
and
spread
out
in
a
soil
adapted
to
transmit
to
these
organs
nutrient
matter
in
a
state
fitted
for
absorption
it
must
be
provided
with
a
reservoir
for
containing
its
food
in
order
that
it
may
carry
its
aliment
about
with
it
in
all
its
changes
of
place
and
such
is
the
modification
uniformly
found
in
all
animals
an
internal
reservoir
for
containing
its
food
is
provided
perhaps
for
every
animal
without
exception
even
the
simplest
and
minutest
creatures
with
which
the
microscope
has
made
us
acquainted
the
lowest
tribes
of
the
infusoria
fig

the
sentient
cellules
placed
at
the
very
bottom
of
the
animal
scale
possess
this
modification
of
structure
for
a
long
time
it
was
conceived
that
these
minute
and
simple
creatures
were
without
distinction
of
parts
that
they
had
no
separate
organs
for
the
reception
and
digestion
of
their
food
that
they
absorbed
their
aliment
through
the
porous
tissue
of
which
their
body
is
composed
that
thus
instead
of
having
a
separate
stomach
their
entire
body
is
a
stomach
and
instead
of
having
even
as
much
as
a
separate
organ
for
absorption
like
the
more
perfect
plant
the
whole
body
might
be
considered
as
a
single
spongeole
but
by
a
simple
and
beautiful
experiment
a
german
physiologist
has
shown
the
incorrectness
of
this
opinion
and
has
established
the
fact
that
the
distinction
between
the
plant
and
the
animal
here
contended
for
is
found
even
at
the
very
lowest
point
of
the
animal
scale
like
other
physiologists
conceiving
that
the
difficulty
of
discovering
the
structure
of
the
lower
tribes
of
the
animalculi
might
be
owing
to
the
transparency
or
the
tissues
of
which
they
are
composed
it
struck
ehrenberg
that
if
he
could
feed
them
with
coloured
substances
he
might
obtain
some
insight
into
their
organization
in
his
first
endeavours
to
accomplish
this
object
he
failed
for
he
employed
the
pigments
in
ordinary
use
but
either
the
animals
would
not
touch
aliment
thus
adulterated
or
those
that
did
so
were
instantly
killed
it
then
occurred
to
him
that
these
colours
are
adulterated
with
lead
and
other
substances
in
all
probability
noxious
to
the
little
subjects
of
his
experiment
what
i
require
said
he
is
some
vegetable
or
animal
colouring
matter
perfectly
pure
he
then
tried
perfectly
pure
indigo
and
perfectly
pure
carmine
his
success
was
now
complete
in
a
minute
or
two
after
mixing
with
their
food
pure
vegetable
colouring
matter
he
observed
in
the
interior
of
the
body
of
these
creatures
minute
spots
of
a
definite
figure
and
of
the
colour
of
the
pigment
employed
fig
viii
the
form
and
magnitude
of
these
spots
were
different
in
different
tribes
but
the
same
in
the
same
individual
and
even
in
the
same
species
fig
ix
fig

no
other
parts
of
the
body
were
tinged
with
the
colour
though
the
animals
remained
in
the
coloured
fluid
for
days
together
this
was
decisive
this
physiologist
had
now
obtained
an
instrument
capable
of
revealing
to
him
the
interior
organization
of
a
class
of
beings
the
structure
of
which
had
heretofore
been
wholly
unknown
on
applying
it
to
the
monas

fig

the
animated
point
or
cellule
which
stands
at
the
bottom

he
discovered
in
the
posterior
portion
of
its
body
several
coloured
spots
which
constitute
its
stomachs

the
different
situations
and
different
forms
of
the

different

in
which
the
currents
of
fluid
flowing
to
their

are
seen
fig
ix
fig

these
experiments
go
far
towards
establishing
the
fact
that
every
animal
even
the
very
lowest
has
an
external
mouth
and
an
internal
stomach
and
that
it
takes
its
food
by
an
act
of
volition
illustration
fig
ix
illustration
fig

but
if
the
proof
of
this
must
be
admitted
to
be
still
imperfect
with
regard
to
the
lowest
tribes
of
animals
it
is
certain
that
as
we
ascend
in
the
scale
of
organization
the
nutritive
apparatus
is
uniformly
arranged
in
this
mode
every
animal
of
every
class
large
enough
to
be
distinctly
visible
and
the
structure
of
which
is
not
rendered
inappreciable
by
the
transparency
of
its
solids
and
fluids
is
manifestly
provided
with
a
distinct
internal
reservoir
for
containing
its
food
on
the
internal
surface
of
this
reservoir
open
the
mouths
of
vessels
minute
in
size
but
countless
in
number
which
absorb
the
food
from
the
stomach
fig

shows
these
vessels
opening
on
the
inner
surface
of
the
stomach
the
white
points
representing
their
mouths
turgid
with
the
food
they
have
absorbed
fig

exhibits
magnified
views
of
the
same

the
points
representing
their
open
mouths
and
the

the
vessels
themselves
in
continuation
with
their
mouths
fig

the
appearance
of
the
inner
surface
of
the
intestine
soon
after
the
animal
has
taken
food
the
smaller

the
absorbent

the

from
this
account
it
is
clear
that
the
absorbing
vessels
of
the
stomach
perform
an
office
precisely
analogous
to
that
of
the
spongeoles
of
the
root
what
the
soil
is
to
the
plant
the
stomach
is
to
the
animal
the
absorbing
vessels
diffused
through
the
stomach
as
long
as
the
stomach
contains
food
are
in
exactly
the
same
condition
as
the

it
is
their

as

is
the
expedient
adopted
to

but
the
more
elaborate
organization
which
it
is
necessary
to
impart
to
the
apparatus
of
the
inferior
function
in
consequence
of
the
communication
of
a
superior
faculty
is
not
completed
simply
by
the
addition
of
this
new
organ
the
stomach
other
complications
are
indispensable
for
if
food
be
contained
in
an
isolated
organ
placed
in
the
interior
of
the
body
means
must
be
provided
for
conveying
the
food
into
this
organ
hence
the
necessity
of
an
apparatus
for
deglutition
moreover
the
food
having
been
conveyed
to
the
stomach
and
having
undergone
there
the
requisite
changes
means
must
next
be
provided
for
conveying
it
from
the
stomach
to
the
other
parts
of
the
body
hence
the
necessity
of
an
apparatus
for
the
circulation
but
food
however
elaborately
prepared
by
the
stomach
is
incapable
of
nourishing
the
body
until
it
has
been
submitted
to
the
action
of
atmospheric
air
hence
the
necessity
of
an
additional
apparatus
either
for
conveying
food
to
the
air
or
for
transmitting
air
to
the
food
or
for
bringing
both
the
food
and
the
air
into
contact
in
the
same
organ
and
when
structure
after
structure
has
been
built
up
in
order
to
carry
on
this
extended
series
of
processes
the
number
of
provisions
required
is
not
even
yet
complete
for
of
the
most
nutritious
fond
the
whole
mass
is
not
nutritive
and
even
the
whole
of
that
portion
of
it
which
is
actually
applied
to
the
purpose
of
nutrition
becomes
after
a
time
worn
out
and
must
be
removed
from
the
system
hence
the
necessity
of
a
further
apparatus
for
excretion
that
nutrition
and
locomotion
may
go
on
together
it
is
clear
then
that
there
must
be
provided
a
distinct
apparatus
for
containing
food
a
distinct
apparatus
for
deglutition
a
distinct
apparatus
for
circulation
a
distinct
apparatus
for
respiration
a
distinct
apparatus
for
excretion
and
so
on
and
that
in
this
manner
the
communication
of
a
single
function
of
a
superior
order
renders
a
modification
not
merely
of
one
but
of
many
inferior
functions
absolutely
indispensable
in
order
to
adjust
the
one
to
the
other
and
to
enable
them
to
act
in
harmony
but
the
necessary
complication
of
structure
does
not
stop
even
here
for
the
communication
of
one
function
of
a
superior
order
imposes
the
necessity
of
communicating
still
another
locomotion
can
not
be
exercised
without
perception
sensation
is
indispensable
to
volition
and
volition
of
course
to
voluntary
motion
a
being
endowed
with
the
power
of
moving
from
place
to
place
without
possessing
the
power
of
perceiving
external
objects
must
be
speedily
destroyed
the
communication
of
sensation
to
a
creature
fixed
immovably
to
a
single
spot
conscious
of
the
approach
of
bodies
but
incapable
of
avoiding
their
contact
would
be
not
only
useless
but
pernicious
since
it
would
be
to
make
a
costly
provision
for
the
production
of
pain
and
nothing
else
but
the
communication
of
locomotion
without
sensation
would
be
as
unwisely
defective
as
the
former
would
be
perniciously
expensive
since
it
would
be
to
endow
a
being
with
a
faculty
the
exercise
of
which
would
be
fatal
to
it
for
the
want
of
a
second
faculty
to
guide
the
first
nor
could
the
possession
of
locomotion
without
the
further
possession
of
sensation
be
otherwise
than
fatal
for
another
reason
consciousness
is
not
necessary
to
nutrition
as
performed
by
the
plant
but
it
is
indispensable
to
nutrition
as
performed
by
the
animal
for
if
the
food
of
the
animal
be
not
always
on
the
same
spot
with
itself
if
it
be
under
the
necessity
of
searching
for
it
and
of
conveying
it
when
found
into
the
interior
of
its
body
it
must
of
course
possess
the
power
of
perceiving
it
when
within
its
reach
and
of
apprehending
and
appropriating
it
by
an
act
of
volition
of
none
of
which
actions
is
it
capable
without
the
possession
of
sensation
again
then
we
see
that
in
order
to
secure
harmonious
action
function
must
be
put
in
relation
with
function
in
order
to
prevent
jarring
and
action
function
must
be
superadded
to
function
and
throughout
the
animal
creation
the
complication
of
structure
which
is
necessary
for
the
accomplishment
of
these
ends
is
given
without
parsimony
but
without
profusion
nothing
is
given
which
is
not
needed
nothing
is
withheld
which
is
required
as
we
ascend
in
the
scale
of
organization
numerous
functions
being
carried
on
and
numerous
organs
constructed
for
performing
them
it
is
obvious
that
the
range
of
each
function
must
be
proportionally
extended
the
range
necessarily
increasing
with
the
multiplication
of
organ
and
function
and
this
is
another
cause
of
the
unavoidable
complication
of
structure
slight
consideration
will
suffice
to
show
the
necessary
connexion
between
an
extended
range
of
action
and
complication
of
structure
take
as
an
example
the
organic
function
of
respiration
respiration
is
the
function
by
which
air
is
brought
into
contact
with
food
it
is
the
completion
of
digestion
the
sole
end
of
all
the
apparatus
that
belongs
to
this
function
is
to
bring
the
air
and
the
food
into
a
certain
degree
of
proximity
now
when
all
the
substances
that
enter
into
the
composition
of
the
body
of
an
animal
are
slight
delicate
and
permeable
to
air
as
in
fig
xiv
and
when
the
body
is
always
surrounded
by
air
air
must
at
all
times
be
in
contact
with
the
particular
organ
that
contains
the
food
no
less
than
with
the
general
system
to
which
the
food
is
distributed
in
this
case
to
construct
a
separate
apparatus
for
containing
air
would
be
useless
because
wherever
food
is
there
air
must
be
since
it
constantly
permeates
every
part
of
the
body
illustration
fig
xiv
when
on
the
other
hand
the
tissues
are
so
firm
and
dense
as
to
be
impermeable
when
they
are
folded
into
bulky
and
complex
organs
and
when
these
organs
are
placed
in
situations
to
which
the
external
air
can
not
reach
the
construction
of
a
separate
apparatus
for
respiration
is
indispensable
the
respiratory
apparatus
consists
either
of
organs
for
carrying
air
to
the
food
or
of
organs
for
carrying
food
to
the
air
the
one
or
the
other
is
adopted
according
to
the
nature
of
the
body
if
the
size
of
the
animal
be
small
if
the
tissues
which
form
the
solid
portion
of
its
body
be
delicate
in
texture
if
at
the
same
time
the
wants
of
its
economy
require
that
its
food
should
be
highly
aërated
for
there
is
the
closest
connexion
between
energy
of
function
and
perfect
aëration
of
the
food
an
apparatus
of
sufficient
magnitude
to
aërate
the
food
in
a
high
degree
would
occupy
the
entire
bulk
of
the
body
in
such
a
case
it
is
easier
to
carry
air
to
the
food
than
food
to
the
air
it
is
better
to
make
the
entire
body
a
respiratory
organ
than
to
construct
a
respiratory
organ
disproportioned
to
the
magnitude
of
the
body
diffused
through
every
part
of
the
body
and
opening
on
its
external
surface
would
obviously
afford
to
every
point
of
the
system
an
easy
access
of
air
by
an
expedient
of
this
kind
the
system
might
be
highly
aërated
while
the
respiratory
apparatus
would
occupy
but
a
comparatively
small
space
the
function
might
be
performed
on
an
extended
scale
while
there
would
be
no
necessity
for
encumbering
a
minute
body
with
a
bulky
organ
and
this
is
the
mode
in
which
respiration
is
carried
on
in
large
tribes
of
creatures
whose
body
is
small
in
size
and
delicate
in
texture
and
the
functions
of
whose
economy
are
performed
with
energy

but
this
contrivance
will
not
do
when
the
animal
is
of
large
magnitude
when
its
body
is
divided
into
numerous
compartments
when
these
compartments
extend
far
beneath
the

when
important
organs
are
placed
in

and
when
the

that

as
this
would
be
difficult

not
impossible
at
all
events
it
is
easier
in
such
a
case
to
carry
the
food
to
the
air
than
the
air
to
the
food

for
the
accomplishment
of
this
purpose
what
is
necessary

an

of

to
a
current
of

and
finally
tubes
to
carry
out
to

the
product
of
this
complicated
operation
accordingly
a
reservoir
of
food
and
a
reservoir
of
air
an
apparatus
by
which
both
are
conveyed
to
their
respective
receptacles
and
an
apparatus
by
which
both
are
brought
into
contact
sufficiently
close
to
admit
of
their
mutual
action
are
all
combined
in
the
lung
of
the
animal
and
in
the
mechanism
by
which
its
movements
are
effected
the
object
is
accomplished
but
the
apparatus
by
which
it
is
effected
is
as
complex
in
structure
as
it
is
efficient
in
action
the
result
simple
the

by
which
the
result
is
secured
highly

and
if
this
be
true
of
an
inferior
or
organic
function
it
is
still
more
strikingly
true
of
a
superior
or
animal
function
the
relation
is
still
stricter
between
the
complexity
of
the
apparatus
of
sensation
and
the
range
of
feeling
than
between
the
complexity
of
the
apparatus
of
respiration
and
the
range
of
the
respiratory
process
the
greater
the
number
of
the
senses
the
greater
the
number
of
the
organs
of

the
more
accurate
and
varied
the

conveyed

the

the

the
greater
the

of
its

and
the
more
exquisite
their
organization
from
the
point
of
the
animal
scale
at
which
the
brain
first
becomes
distinctly
visible
up
to
man
the
basis
of
the
organ
is
the
same
but
as
the
range
of
its
function
extends
part
after
part
is
superadded
and
the
structure
of
each
part
becomes
progressively
more
and
more
complex
the
evidence
of
this
afforded
by
comparative
anatomy
is
irresistible
and
the
interest
connected
with
the
study
of
it
can
scarcely
be
exceeded
in
the
last
place
structure
is
complex
in
proportion
to
the
energy
of

the
greater
the
power
with
which
voluntary
motion
is
capable
of
being
exerted
the
higher
the

by
which
it
is
performed
the
more
compact

in

the

is
as
much
more
developed
than
the

of

its

is
higher
and
its

swifter
the
muscles
which
give
to
the
tiger
the
rapidity
and
strength
of
its
spring
possess
a
more
intense
organization
than
those
which
slowly
move
on
the
tardigrade

the
structure
of
the

of
man
is
more
exquisite
than
that
of
the
fish
as
his
perceptions
are
more
acute
and
capable
of

and
continuity
thus
we
see
that
the
organization
of
the
animal
is
more
complex
than
that
of
the
plant
not
from
an
arbitrary
disposition
but
from
absolute
necessity
the

functions
performed
by
the

require
only
the

with
which
it
is

the
numerous

functions
performed
by
the
animal
require
its
numerous

organs
the
plant
simple
as
it
is
in
structure
is
destitute
of
no
organ
required
by
the
nature
of
its

the
animal
complex
as
it
is
in
structure
is
in
possession
of
no
organ
which
it
could
dispense
with
from
the
one
nothing
is
withheld
which
is
needed
to
the

nothing
is

which
is

shield
them
from
violence
existence
not
being
immediately
dependent
on
the
action
of
the
organs
of
the
animal
life
they
do
not
need
to
be
protected
from
the
contact
of
external
objects
with
extraordinary
care
but
it
is
necessary
to
the
performance
of
their
functions
that
they
should
be
placed
at
the
exterior
of
the
body
and
there
they
are
placed
and
so
placed
as
to
afford
an
effectual
defence
to
the
organic
organs
thus
the
groundwork
of
the
animal
is
made
the
bulwark
of
the
organic
life
the
muscles
the
immediate
agents
by
which
voluntary
motion
is
effected
and
the
bones
the
fixed
points
and
the
levers
by
which
that
motion
acquires
the
nicest
precision
and
the
most
prodigious
rapidity
and
power
are
so
disposed
that
while
the
latter
accomplish
in
the
most
perfect
manner
their
primary
and
essential
office
in
relation
to
the
muscles
they
serve
a
secondary
but
scarcely
less
important
office
in
relation
to
the
internal
viscera
as
we
advance
in
our
subject
we
shall
see
that
a
beautiful
illustration
of
this
is
afforded
in
the
structure
and
action
of
the
trunk
that
the
trunk
is
moveable
that
it
is
composed
of
powerful
muscles
and
of
firm
and
compact
bones
and
that
while
its
movements
are
effected
by
the
action
of
the
muscles
which
are
attached
to
the
bones
these
bones
enclose
a
cavity
in
which
are
placed
the
lungs
the
heart
the
great
trunks
of
the
venous
system
the
great
trunks
of
the
arterial
system
and
the
main
trunk
of
the
thoracic
duct
the
vessel
by
which
the
digested
aliment
is
carried
into
the
blood
chap
thus
by
these
strong
and
firm
bones
together
with
the
thick
and
powerful
muscles
that
rest
upon
them
is
formed
a
secure
shelter
for
a
main
portion
of
the
apparatus
of
the
organic
functions
of
respiration
circulation
and
digestion
the
bones
and
muscles
of
the
thorax
themselves
performing
an
important
part
in
the
function
of
respiration
afford
to
the
lungs
the
chief
organ
of
this
function
composed
of
tender
and
delicate
tissues
easily
injured
and
the
slightest
injury
perilling
life
a
free
and
secure
place
to
act
in
the
fragile
part
of
the
apparatus
is
defended
by
the
osseous
portion
of
it
the
play
of
the
latter
being
equally
essential
to
the
function
as
that
of
the
former
in
like
manner
the
tender
and
delicate
substance
of
the
brain
and
spinal
cord
the
central
seat
of
the
animal
life
with
which
all
the
senses
are
in
intimate
communion
is
protected
by
bones
and
muscles
which
perform
important
voluntary
movements
while
the
organs
of
sense
which
put
us
in
connexion
with
the
external
world
which
render
us
susceptible
of
pleasure
and
which
give
us
notice
of
the
approach
of
objects
capable
of
exciting
pain
are
placed
where
external
bodies
may
be
brought
most
conveniently
and
completely
into
contact
with
them
and
where
alone
they
can
be
efficient
as
the
sentinels
of
the
system
for
this
reason
with
the
exception
of
the
sense
of
touch
which
though
placed
especially
at
the
extremities
of
the
fingers
is
also
diffused
over
the
whole
external
surface
of
the
frame
all
the
senses
have
their
several
seats
in
the
head
the
most
elevated
part
of
the
body
of
an
ovoid
figure
capable
of
moving
independently
of
the
rest
of
the
fabric
and
which
being
supported
on
a
pivot
is
enabled
to
describe
at
least
of
a
circle
such
is
the
difference
in
the
structure
and
position
of
the
apparatus
of
the
two
lives
but
the
difference
in
their
action
is
still
more
striking
the
action
of
the
apparatus
of
the
organic
life
when
sound
is
without
consciousness
the
object
of
the
action
of
the
apparatus
of
the
animal
life
is
the
production
of
consciousness
the
final
cause
of
the
action
of
the
apparatus
of
the
organic
life
is
the
maintenance
of
existence
the
final
cause
of
the
action
of
the
apparatus
of
the
animal
life
is
the
production
of
conscious
existence
what
purpose
would
be
answered
by
connecting
consciousness
with
the
action
of
the
organic
organs
were
we
sensible
of
the
organic
processes
did
we
know
when
the
heart
beats
and
the
lung
plays
and
the
stomach
digests
and
the
excretory
organ
excretes
the
consciousness
could
not
promote
but
might
disturb
the
due
and
orderly
course
of
these
processes
moreover
they
would
so
occupy
and
engross
our
minds
that
we
should
have
little
inclination
or
time
to
attend
to
other
objects
beneficently
therefore
are
they
placed
equally
beyond
our
observation
and
control
nevertheless
when
our
consciousness
of
these
processes
may
be
of
service
when
they
are
going
wrong
when
their
too
feeble
or
too
intense
action
is
in
danger
of
destroying
existence
the
animal
life
is
made
sensible
of
what
is
passing
in
the
organic
in
order
that
the
former
may
take
beneficial
cognizance
of
the
latter
may
do
what
experience
may
have
taught
to
be
conducive
to
the
restoration
of
the
diseased
organ
to
a
sound
state
or
avoid
doing
what
may
conduce
to
the
increase
or
maintenance
of
its
morbid
condition
but
while
the
action
of
the
organic
organs
is
thus
kept
alike
from
our
view
and
feeling
the
sole
object
of
the
action
of
the
animal
organs
is
to
produce
and
maintain
a
state
of
varied
and
extended
consciousness
we
do
not
know
when
the
heart
dilates
to
receive
the
vital
current
nor
when
it
contracts
to
propel
it
with
renewed
impetus
through
the
system
nor
when
the
blood
rushes
to
the
lung
to
give
out
its
useless
and
noxious
particles
nor
when
the
air
rushes
to
the
blood
to
take
up
those
particles
to
replace
them
by
others
and
thus
to
purify
and
renovate
the
vital
fluid
many
processes
of
this
kind
are
continually
going
on
within
us
during
every
moment
of
our
existence
but
we
are
no
more
conscious
of
them
than
we
are
of
the
motion
of
the
fluids
in
the
blade
of
grass
on
which
we
tread
on
the
contrary
when
an
external
object
produces
in
a
sentient
nerve
that
change
of
state
which
we
denote
by
the
words
an
impression
when
the
sentient
nerve
transmits
this
impression
to
the
brain
when
the
brain
is
thereby
brought
into
the
state
of
perception
the
animal
life
is
in
active
operation
and
percipient
or
conscious
existence
takes
place
consciousness
does
not
belong
to
the
organic
it
the
animal
life
the
functions
of
the
organic
life
are
performed
with
uninterrupted
continuity
to
those
of
the
animal
life
rest
is
indispensable
the
action
of
the
heart
is
unceasing
it
takes
not
and
needs
not
rest
on
it
goes
for
the
space
of
eighty
or
ninety
years
at
the
rate
of
a
hundred
thousand
strokes
every
hours
having
at
every
stroke
a
great
resistance
to
overcome
yet
it
continues
this
action
for
this
length
of
time
without
intermission
alike
incessant
is
the
action
of
the
lung
which
is
always
receiving
and
always
emitting
air
and
the
action
of
the
skin
which
is
always
transpiring
and
always
absorbing
and
the
action
of
the
alimentary
canal
which
is
always
compensating
the
loss
which
the
system
is
always
sustaining
but
of
this
continuity
of
action
the
organs
and
functions
of
the
animal
life
are
incapable
no
voluntary
muscle
can
maintain
its
action
beyond
a
given
time
no
effort
of
the
will
can
keep
it
in
a
state
of
uninterrupted
contraction
relaxation
must
alternate
with
contraction
and
even
this
alternate
action
can
not
go
on
long
without
rest
no
organ
of
sense
can
continue
to
receive
impression
after
impression
without
fatigue
by
protracted
exertion
the
ear
loses
its
sensibility
to
sound
the
eye
to
light
the
tongue
to
savour
and
the
touch
to
the
qualities
of
bodies
about
which
it
is
conversant
the
brain
can
not
carry
on
its
intellectual
operations
with
vigour
beyond
a
certain
period
the
trains
of
ideas
with
which
it
works
become
after
a
time
indistinct
and
confused
nor
is
it
capable
of
reacting
with
energy
until
it
has
remained
in
a
state
of
rest
proportioned
to
the
duration
of
its
preceding
activity
and
this
rest
is
sleep
sleep
is
the
repose
of
the
senses
the
rest
of
the
muscles
their
support
and
sustenance
what
food
is
to
the
organic
sleep
is
to
the
animal
life
nutrition
can
no
more
go
on
without
aliment
than
sensation
thought
and
motion
without
sleep
but
it
is
the
animal
life
only
that
sleeps
death
would
be
the
consequence
of
the
momentary
slumber
of
the
organic
if
when
the
brain
betook
itself
to
repose
the
engine
that
moves
the
blood
ceased
to
supply
it
with
its
vital
fluid
never
again
would
it
awake
the
animal
life
is
active
only
during
a
portion
of
its
existence
the
activity
of
the
organic
life
is
never
for
a
moment
suspended
and
in
order
to
endow
its
organs
with
the
power
of
continuing
this
uninterrupted
action
they
are
rendered
incapable
of
fatigue
fatigue
on
the
contrary
is
inseparable
from
the
action
of
the
organs
of
the
animal
life
fatigue
imposes
the
necessity
of
rest
rest
is
sleep
and
sleep
is
renovation
between
all
the
functions
of
the
organic
life
there
is
a
close
relation
and
dependence
without
the
circulation
there
can
be
no
secretion
without
secretion
no
digestion
without
digestion
no
nutrition
without
nutrition
no
new
supply
of
circulating
matter
and
so
through
the
entire
circle
but
the
functions
of
the
animal
life
are
not
thus
dependent
on
each
other
one
of
the
circle
may
be
disordered
without
much
disturbance
of
the
rest
and
one
may
cease
altogether
while
another
continues
in
vigorous
action
sensation
may
be
lost
while
motion
continues
and
the
muscle
may
contract
though
it
can
not
feel
one
organ
of
sense
may
sleep
while
the
rest
are
awake
one
intellectual
faculty
may
be
in
operation
while
others
slumber
the
muscle
of
volition
may
act
while
there
is
no
consciousness
of
will
even
the
organs
of
the
voice
and
of
progression
may
perform
their
office
while
the
sensorium
is
deeply
locked
in
sleep
the
two
lives
are
born
at
different
periods
and
the
one
is
in
active
operation
before
the
other
is
even
in
existence
the
first
action
observable
in
the
embryo
is
a
minute
pulsating
point
it
is
the
young
heart
propelling
its
infant
stream
before
brain
or
nerve
or
muscle
can
be
distinguished
the
heart
is
in
existence
and
in
action
that
is
the
apparatus
of
the
organic
function
of
the
circulation
is
built
up
and
is
in
operation
before
there
is
any
trace
of
an
animal
organ
arteries
and
veins
circulate
blood
capillary
vessels
receive
the

and
out
of
it
form
brain
and

the
organs
of
the
animal
no
less
than
the
various
substances
that
compose
the
organs
of
the
organic
life
the
organic
is
not
only
anterior
to
the
animal
life
but
it
is
by
the
action
of
the
organic
that
existence
is
given
to
the
animal
life
the
organic
life
is
born
at
the
first
moment
of
existence
the
animal
life
not
until
a
period
comparatively
distant
the
epoch
emphatically
called
the
period
of
birth
namely
the
period
when
the
new
being
is
detached
from
its
mother
when
it
first
comes
into
contact
with
external
objects
when
it
carries
on
all
the
functions
of
its
economy
by
its
own
organs
and
consequently
enjoys
independent
existence
the
functions
of
the
organic
life
are
perfect
at
once
the
heart
contracts
as
well
the
arteries
secrete
as
well
the
respiratory
organs
work
as
well
the
first
moment
they
begin
to
act
as
at
any
subsequent
period
they
require
no
teaching
from
experience
and
they
profit
nothing
from
its
lessons
on
the
contrary
the
operations
of
the
brain
and
the
actions
of
the
voluntary
muscles
feeble
and
uncertain
at
first
acquire
strength
by
slow
degrees
and
attain
their
ultimate
perfection
only
at
the
adult
age
how
indistinct
and
confused
the
first
sensations
of
the
infant
before
it
acquire
accuracy
precision
and
truth
how
immense
the
labour
spent
upon
perception
sensations
are
succeeded
by
ideas
sensations
and
ideas
coalesce
with
sensations
and
ideas
combinations
thus
formed
suggest
other
combinations
previously
formed
and
these
a
third
and
the
third
a
fourth
and
so
is
constituted
a
continuous
train
of
thought
but
the
infantile
associations
between
sensation
and
sensation
between
idea
and
idea
and
between
sensations
and
ideas
are
to
a
certain
extent
incorrect
and
to
a
still
greater
extent
inadequate
and
the
misconception
necessarily
resulting
from
this
early
imperfection
in
the
intellectual
operations
is
capable
of
correction
only
by
subsequent
and
more
extended
impressions
during
its
making
hours
a
large
portion
of
the
time
of
the
infant
is
spent
in
receiving
impressions
which
come
to
it
every
instant
from
all
directions
and
which
it
stores
up
in
its
little
treasury
but
a
large
portion
is
also
consumed
in
the
far
more
serious
and
difficult
business
of
discrimination
and
correction
could
any
man
after
having
attained
the
age
of
manhood
reverse
the
order
of
the
course
through
which
he
has
passed
could
he
with
the
power
of
observation
together
with
the
experience
that
belong
to
manhood
retrace
with
perfect
exactness
every
step
of
his
sentient
existence
from
the
age
of
forty
to
the
moment
that
the
air
first
came
into
contact
with
his
body
at
the
moment
of
his
leaving
his
maternal
dwelling
among
the
truths
he
would
learn
the
most
interesting
if
not
the
most
surprising
would
be
those
which
relate
to
the
manner
in
which
he
dealt
with
his
earliest
impressions
with
the
mode
in
which
he
combined
them
recalled
them
laid
them
by
for
future
use
made
his
first
general
deduction
observed
what
subsequent
experience
taught
to
be
conformable
and
what
not
conformable
to
this
general
inference
his
emotions
on
detecting
his
first
errors
and
his
contrasted
feelings
on
discovering
those
comprehensive
truths
the
certainty
of
which
became
confirmed
by
every
subsequent
impression
thus
to
live
backwards
would
be
in
fact
to
go
through
the
analysis
of
the
intellectual
combinations
and
consequently
to
obtain
a
perfect
insight
into
the
constitution
of
the
mind
and
among
the
curious
results
which
would
then
become
manifest
perhaps
few
would
appear
more
surprising
than
the
true
action
of
the
senses
the
eye
when
first
impressed
by
light
does
not
perceive
the
objects
that
reflect
it
the
ear
when
first
impressed
by
sound
does
not
distinguish
the
sonorous
body
when
the
operation
for
cataract
has
been
successfully
performed
in
a
person
born
blind
the
eye
immediately
becomes
sensible
to
light
but
the
impression
of
light
does
not
immediately
give
information
relative
to
the
properties
of
bodies
it
is
gradually
not
instantaneously
it
is
even
by
slow
degrees
that
luminous
objects
are
discerned
with
distinctness
and
accuracy
to
see
to
hear
to
smell
to
taste
to
touch
are
processes
which
appear
to
be
performed
instantaneously
and
which
actually
are
performed
with
astonishing
rapidity
in
a
person
who
observes
them
in
himself
but
they
were
not
always
performed
thus
rapidly
they
are
processes
acquired
businesses
learnt
processes
and
businesses
acquired
and
learnt
not
without
the
cost
of
many
efforts
and
much
labour
but
the
senses
afford
merely
the
materials
for
the
intellectual
operations
of
memory
combination
comparison
discrimination
induction
operations
the
progress
of
which
is
so
slow
that
they
acquire
precision
energy
and
comprehensiveness
only
after
the
culture
of
years
and
the
same
is
true
of
the
muscles
of
volition
how
many
efforts
are
made
before
the
power
of
distinct
articulation
is
acquired
how
many
before
the
infant
can
stand
how
many
before
the
child
can
walk
the
organic
life
is
born
perfect
the
animal
life
becomes
perfect
only
by
servitude
and
the
aptitude
which
service
gives
the
organic
life
may
exist
after
the
animal
life
has
perished
the
animal
life
is
extinguished
when
sensation
is
abolished
and
voluntary
motion
can
be
performed
no
more
but
disease
may
abolish
sensation
and
destroy
the
power
of
voluntary
motion
while
circulation
respiration
secretion
excretion
in
a
word
the
entire
circle
of
the
organic
functions
continues
to
be
performed
in
a
single
instant
apoplexy
may
reduce
to
drivelling
fatuity
the
most
exalted
intellect
and
render
powerless
and
motionless
muscles
of
gigantic
strength
while
the
action
of
the
heart
and
the
involuntary
contractions
of
the
muscles
may
not
only

may
act
with
preternatural
energy
in
a
single
instant
apoplexy
may
even
completely
extinguish
the
animal
life
and
yet
the
organic
may
go
on
for
hours
days
and
even
weeks
while
catalepsy
perhaps
the
most
singular
disease
to
which
the
human
frame
is
subject
may
wholly
abolish
sensation
and
volition
while
it
may
impart
to
the
voluntary
muscles
the
power
of
contracting
with
such
unnatural
energy
and
continuity
that
the
head
the
trunk
the
limbs
may
become
immoveably
fixed
in
whatever
attitude
they
happen
to
be
at
the
moment
the
paroxysm
comes
on
in
this
extraordinary
condition
of
the
nervous
system
however
long
the
paroxysm
last
and
however
complete
the
abolition
of
consciousness
the
heart
continues
to
beat

to
throb

to
respire

all
the

their
ordinary
functions
jebb
gives
the
following
description
of
the
condition
of
a
young
lady
who
was
the
subject
of
this
curious
malady
my
patient
was
seized
with
an
attack
just
as
i
was
announced
at
that
moment
she
was
employed
in
netting
she
was
in
the
act
of
passing
the
needle
through
the
mesh
in
that
position
she
became
immoveably
rigid
exhibiting
in
a
pleasing
form
a
figure
of
sleep
beyond
the
power
of
art
to
imitate
or
the
imagination
to
conceive
her
forehead
was
serene
her
features
perfectly
composed
the
paleness
of
her
colour
and
her
breathing
which
at
a
distance
was
scarcely
perceptible
operated
in
rendering
the
similitude
to
marble
more
exact
and
striking
the
position
of
her
fingers
hands
and
arms
was
altered
with
difficulty
but
preserved
every
form
of
flexure
they
acquired
nor
were
the
muscles
of
the
neck
exempted
from
this
law
her
head
maintaining
every
situation
in
which
the
hand
could
place
it
as
firmly
as
her
limbs
in
this
condition
of
the
system
the
senses
were
in
a
state
of
profound
sleep
the
voluntary
muscles
on
the
contrary
were
in
a
state
of
violent
action
but
this
action
not
being
excited
by
volition
nor
under
its
control
the
patient
remained
as
motionless
as
she
was
insensible
the
brain
was
in
a
state
of
temporary
death
the
muscle
in
a
state
of
intense
life
and
the
converse
may
happen
the
muscle
may
die
while
the
brain
lives
contractility
may
be
destroyed
while
sensibility
is
perfect
the
power
of
motion
may
be
lost
while
that
of
sensation
may
remain
unaffected
a
case
is
on
record
which
affords
an
illustration
of
this
condition
of
the
system
a
woman
had
been
for
some
time
confined
to
her
bed
labouring
under
severe
indisposition
on
a
sudden
she
was
deprived
of
the
power
of
moving
a
single
muscle
of
the
body
she
attempted
to
speak
but
she
had
no
power
to
articulate
she
endeavoured
to
stretch
out
her
hand
but
her
muscles
refused
to
obey
the
commands
of
her
will
yet
her
consciousness
was
perfect
and
she
retained
the
complete
possession
of
her
intellectual
faculties
she
perceived
that
her
attendants
thought
her
dead
and
was
conscious
of
the
performance
upon
her
own
person
of
the
services
usually
paid
to
the
dead
she
was
laid
out
her
toes
were
bound
together
her
chin
was
tied
up
she
heard
the
arrangements
for
her
funeral
discussed
and
yet
she
was
unable
to
make
the
slightest
sign
that
she
was
still
in
the
possession
of
sense
feeling
and
life
in
one
form
of
disease
then
the
animal
life
both
the
sensitive
and
the
motive
portions
of
it
may
perish
and
in
another
form
of
disease
either
the
one
or
the
other
part
of
it
may
be
suspended
while
the
organic
life
continues
in
full
operation
it
follows
that
the
two
lives
blended
as
they
are
are
distinct
since
the
one
is
capable
of
perishing
without
immediately
and
inevitably
involving
the
destruction
of
the
other
and
finally
as
the
organic
life
is
the
first
born
so
it
is
the
last
to
die
while
the
animal
life
as
it
is
the
latest
born
and
the
last
to
attain
its
full
development
so
it
is
the
earliest
to
decline
and
the
first
to
perish
in
the
process
of
natural
death
the
extinction
of
the
animal
is
always
anterior
to
that
of
the
organic
life
real
death
is
a
later
and
sometimes
a
much
later
event
than
apparent
death
an
animal
appears
to
be
dead
when
together
with
the
abolition
of
sensation
and
the
loss
of
voluntary
motion
respiration
circulation
and
the
rest
of
the
organic
functions
can
no
longer
be
distinguished
but
these
functions
go
on
some
time
after
they
have
ceased
to
afford
external
indications
of
their
action
in
man
and
the
warmblooded
animals
in
general
suspension
or
submersion
extinguishes
the
animal
life
at
the
latest
within
the
space
of
four
minutes
from
the
time
that
the
atmospheric
air
is
completely
excluded
from
the
lung
but
did
the
organic
functions
also
cease
at
the
same
period
it
would
be
impossible
to
restore
an
animal
to
life
after
apparent
death
from
drowning
and
the
like
but
however
complete
and
protracted
the
abolition
of
the
animal
functions
is
always
possible
as
long
as
the
organic
organs
are
capable
of
being
restored
to
their
usual
vigour
the
cessation
of
the
animal
life
is
but
the
first
stage
of
death
from
which
recovery
is
possible
death
is
complete
only
when
the
organic
together
with
the
animal
functions
have
wholly
ceased
and
are
incapable
of
being
in
man
the
process
of
death
is
seldom
altogether
natural
it
is
generally
rendered
premature
by
the
operation
of
circumstances
which
destroy
life
otherwise
than
by
that
progressive
and
slow
decay
which
is
the
inevitable
result
of
the
action
of
organized
structure
death
when
natural
is
the
last
event
of
an
extended
series
of
which
the
first
that
is
appreciable
is
a
change
in
the
animal
life
and
in
the
noblest
portion
of
that
life
the
higher
faculties
fail
in
the
reverse
order
of
their
development
the
retrogression
is
the
inverse
of
the
progression
and
the
noblest
creature
in
returning
to
the
state
of
retraces
step
by
step
each
successive
stage
by
which
it
reached
the
summit
of
life
in
the
advancing
series
the
animal
is
superadded
to
the
organic
life
sensation
the
lowest
faculty
of
the
animal
life
precedes
ratiocination
the
highest
the
senses
called
into
play
at
the
moment
of
birth
soon
acquire
the
utmost
perfection
of
which
they
are
capable
but
the
intellectual
faculties
later
developed
are
still
later
perfected
and
the
highest
the
latest
in
the
descending
series
the
animal
life
fails
before
the
organic
and
its
nobler
powers
decay
sooner
and
more
rapidly
than
the
subordinate
first
of
all
the
impressions
which
the
organs
of
sense
convey
to
the
brain
become
less
numerous
and
distinct
and
consequently
the
material
on
which
the
mind
operates
is
less
abundant
and
perfect
but
at
the
same
time
the
power
of
working
vigorously
with
the
material
it
possesses
more
than
proportionally
diminishes
memory
fails
analogous
phenomena
are
less
readily
and
less
completely
recalled
by
the
presence
of
those
which
should
suggest
the
entire
train
the
connecting
links
are
dimly
seen
or
wholly
lost
the
train
itself
is
less
vivid
and
less
coherent
train
succeeds
train
with
preternatural
slowness
and
the
consequence
of
these
growing
imperfections
is
that
at
last
induction
becomes
unsound
just
as
it
was
in
early
youth
and
for
the
same
reason
namely
because
there
is
not
in
the
mental
view
an
adequate
range
of
individual
phenomena
the
only
difference
being
that
the
range
comprehended
in
the
view
of
the
old
man
is
too
narrow
because
that
which
he
had
learnt
he
has
forgotten
while
in
the
youth
it
is
too
narrow
because
that
which
it
is
necessary
to
learn
has
not
been
acquired
and
with
the
diminution
of
intellectual
power
the
senses
continue
progressively
to
fail
the
eye
grows
more
dim
the
ear
more
dull
the
sense
of
smell
less
delicate
the
sense
of
touch
less
acute
while
the
sense
of
taste
immediately
subservient
to
the
organic
function
of
nutrition
is
the
last
to
diminish
in
intensity
and
correctness
and
wholly
fails
but
with
the
extinction
of
the
life
it
serves
but
the
senses
are
not
the
only
servants
of
the
brain
the
voluntary
muscles
are
so
equally
but
these
ministers
to
the
no
longer
kept
in
active
service
the
former
no
longer
employed
to
convey
new
varied
and
vivid
impressions
the
latter
no
longer
employed
to
execute
the
commands
of
new
varied
and
intense
desires
become
successively
feebler
slower
and
more
uncertain
in
their
action
the
hand
trembles
the
step
totters
and
every
movement
is
tardy
and
unsteady
and
thus
by
the
loss
of
one
intellectual
faculty
after
another
by
the
obliteration
of
sense
after
sense
by
the
progressive
failure
of
the
power
of
voluntary
motion
in
a
word
by
the
declining
energy
and
the
ultimate
extinction
of
the
animal
life
man
from
the
state
of
maturity
passes
a
second
time
through
the
stage
of
childhood
back
to
that
of
infancy
lapses
even
into
the
condition
of
the
embryo
what
the
fœtus
was
the
man
of
extreme
old
age
is
when
he
began
to
exist
he
possessed
only
organic
life
and
before
he
is
ripe
for
the
tomb
he
returns
to
the
condition
of
the
plant
and
even
this
merely
organic
existence
can
not
be
long
maintained
slow
may
be
the
waste
of
the
organic
organs
but
they
do
waste
and
that
waste
is
not
repaired
and
consequently
their
functions
languish
and
no
amount
of
stimulus
is
capable
of
invigorating
their
failing
action
the
arteries
are
rigid
and
can
not
nourish
the
veins
are
relaxed
and
can
not
carry
on
the
mass
of
blood
that
oppresses
them
the
lungs
partly
choked
up
by
the
deposition
of
adventitious
matter
and
partly
incapable
of
expanding
and
collapsing
by
reason
of
the
feeble
action
of
the
respiratory
apparatus
imperfectly
aërate
the
small
quantity
of

that
flows
through
them
the
heart
deprived
of
its
wonted
nutriment
and

is
unable
to
contract
with
the
energy
requisite
to
propel

the

no

supplied
with
the
quantity
and

of
material
necessary
for

the

and
this
is

now
the
processes
of

at
an
end
the

within
the
dominion
of
the

in

so
the

go

has
its

to
the

its

a

ultimate

of

and
of

by
which
the
organic

influence

and

which
the

of

and
to
the
continuance
of
their
of
human
of
human
happiness
the
object
of
structure
is
the
production
of
function
of
the
two
functions
combined
in
the
living
animal
one
is
wholly
subservient
to
the
other
to
build
up
the
apparatus
of
the
animal
life
and
to
maintain
it
in
a
condition
fit
for
performing
its
functions
is
the
sole
object
of
the
existence
of
the
organic
life
what
then
is
the
object
of
the
animal
life
that
object
whatever
it
be
must
be
the
ultimate
end
of
organization
and
of
all
the
actions
of
which
it
is
the
seat
and
the
instrument
two
functions
sensation
and
voluntary
motion
are
combined
in
the
animal
life
of
these
two
functions
the
latter
is
subservient
to
the
former
voluntary
motion
is
the
servant
of
sensation
and
exists
only
to
obey
its
commands
is
sensation
then
the
ultimate
object
of
organization
simple
sensation
can
not
be
an
ultimate
object
because
it
is
invariably
attended
with
an
ultimate
result
for
sensation
is
either
pleasurable
or
painful
every
sensation
terminates
in
a
pleasure
or
a
pain
pleasure
or
pain
the
last
event
in
the
series
must
then
be
the
final
end
is
the
production
of
pain
the
ultimate
object
of
organization
that
can
not
be
for
the
production
of
pain
is
the
indirect
not
the
direct
extraordinary
not
the
ordinary
result
of
the
actions
of
life
it
follows
that
pleasure
must
be
the
ultimate
object
for
there
is
no
other
of
which
it
is
possible
to
conceive
the
end
of
organic
existence
is
animal
existence
the
end
of
animal
existence
is
sentient
existence
the
end
of
sentient
existence
is
pleasurable
existence
the
end
of
life
therefore
is
enjoyment
life
commences
with
the
organic
processes
to
the
organic
are
superadded
the
animal
the
animal
processes
terminate
in
sensation
sensation
ends
in
enjoyment
it
follows
that
enjoyment
is
the
final
end
for
this
every
organ
is
constructed
to
this
every
action
of
every
organ
is
subservient
in
this
every
action
ultimately
terminates
and
without
a
single
exception
in
the
entire
range
of
the
sentient
creation
the
higher
the
organized
structure
the
greater
the
enjoyment
mediately
or
immediately
to
which
it
is
subservient
from
its
most
simple
to
its
most
complex
state
every
successive
addition
to
structure
by
which
function
is
rendered
more
elevated
and
perfect
proportionally
increases
the
exquisiteness
of
the
pleasure
to
which
the
function
ministers
and
in
which
it
terminates
pleasure
is
the
result
of
the
action
of
living
organs
whether
organic
or
animal
pleasure
is
the
direct
the
ordinary
and
the
gratuitous
result
of
the
action
of
both
sets
of
organs
the
pleasure
resulting
from
the
action
of
the
organs
is
conducive
to
their
complete
development
and
thereby
to
the
increase
of
their
capacity
for
affording
enjoyment
the
pleasure
resulting
from
the
action
of
the
organs
and
conducive
to
their
development
is
equally
conducive
to
the
perpetuation
of
their
action
and
consequently
to
the
maintenance
of
life
it
follows
not
only
that
enjoyment
is
the
end
of
life
but
that
it
is
the
means
by
which
life
is
prolonged
of
the
truth
of
each
of
these
propositions
it
will
be
interesting
to
contemplate
the
plenitude
of
the
proof
in
the
first
place
pleasure
is
the
result
of
the
action
of
the
organic
organs
it
has
indeed
been
shown
that
the
very
character
by
which
the
action
of
these
organs
is
distinguished
is
that
they
are
unattended
with
consciousness
nevertheless
by
a
special
provision
consciousness
is
indirectly
connected
with
the
processes
of
this
class
limited
in
extent
indeed
and
uniformly
terminating
at
a
certain
point
but
the
extent
and
the
limitation
alike
conducing
to
the
pleasurableness
of
its
nature
and
this
is
an
adjustment
in
the
constitution
of
our
frame
which
is
well
deserving
of
attention
organic
processes
are
dependent
on
a
peculiar
influence
derived
from
that
portion
of
the
nervous
system
distinguished
by
the
term
organic
the
organic
nerves
distributed
to
the
organic
organs
take
their
origin
and
have
their
chief
seat
in
the
cavities
that
contain
the
main
instruments
of
the
organic
life
namely
the
chest
and
abdomen
see
chap
as
will
be
fully
shown
hereafter
these
nerves
encompass
the
great
trunks
of
the
that
convey
arterial
blood
to
the
organic
organs
in
all
its
ramifications
through
an
organic
organ
an
arterial
vessel
is
accompanied
by
its
organic
nerve
so
that
wherever
the
capillary
arterial
branch
goes
secreting
or
nourishing
there
goes
inseparably
united
with
it
an
organic
nerve
exciting
and
governing
among
the
peculiarities
of
this
portion
of
the
nervous
system
one
of
the
most
remarkable
is
that
it
is
wholly
destitute
of
feeling
sensibility
is
inseparably
associated
with
the
idea
commonly
formed
of
a
nerve
but
the
nervous
system
consists
of
two
portions
one
presiding
over
sensation
and
voluntary
motion
hence
called
the
sentient
and
the
motive
portions
the
other
destitute
of
sensation
but
presiding
over
the
organic
processes
hence
called
the
organic
portion
if
the
communication
between
the
organic
organ
and
the
organic
nerve
be
interrupted
the
function
of
the
organ
whatever
it
be
is
arrested
without
its
organic
nerves
the
stomach
can
not
secrete
gastric
juice
the
consequence
is
that
the
aliment
is
undigested
without
its
organic
nerves
the
liver
can
not
secrete
bile
the
consequence
is
that
the
nutritive
part
of
the
aliment
is
incapable
of
being
separated
from
its
excrementitious
portion
the
organic
organ
receives
from
its
organic
nerve
an
influence
without
which
it
can
not
perform
its
function
but
the
nerve
belonging
to
this
class
neither
feels
nor
communicates
feeling
and
hence
it
imparts
no
consciousness
of
the
operation
of
any
process
dependent
upon
it
yet
there
is
not
one
of
these
processes
that
does
not
exert
a
most
important
influence
over
consciousness
how
by
a
special
provision
as
curious
in
its
nature
as
it
is
important
in
its
result
branches
of
sentient
nerves
are
transmitted
from
the
animal
to
the
organic
system
and
from
the
organic
to
the
animal
and
an
intimate
communication
is
established
between
the
two
classes
the
inspection

is

materially

in

the
state
of

is
nothing
but
the
result
of
the
due
performance
of

it
follows
that
the
feeling
of
health
the
feeling
which
is
ranked
by
every
one
among
the
most
pleasurable
of
existence
is
the
result
of
the
action
of
organs
of
whose
direct
operations
we
are
unconscious
but
the
pleasurable
consciousness
thus
indirectly
excited
is
really
the
consequence
of
a
special
provision
established
for
the
express
purpose
of
producing
pleasure
processes
in
their
own
nature
insensible
are
rendered
sentient
expressly
for
this
purpose
that
over
and
above
the
special
object
they
serve
they
may
afford
enjoyment
in
this
case
the
production
of
pleasure
is
not
only
altogether
gratuitous
not
only
communicated
for
its
own
sake
not
only
rested
in
as
an
ultimate
object
but
it
is
made
to
commence
at
the
very
confines
of
life
it
is
interwoven
with
the
thread
of
existence
it
is
secured
in
and
by
the
actions
that
build
up
and
that
support
the
very
framework
the
material
instrument
of
our
being
but
if
the
communication
of
sensibility
to
processes
in
their
own
nature
incapable
of
exciting
feeling
for
the
purpose
of
converting
them
into
sources
of
pleasurable
consciousness
indicate
an
express
provision
for
the
production
of
enjoyment
that
provision
is
no
less
exemplified
in
the
point
at
which
this
superadded
sensibility
is
made
to
cease
some
of
the
consequences
of
a
direct
communication
of
consciousness
to
an
organic
process
have
been
already
adverted
to

the
eye
besides
transmitting
rays
of
light
to
the
optic
nerve
been
rendered
sensible
of
the
successive
passage
of
each
ray
through
its
substance
the
impression
excited
by
luminous
bodies
which
is
indispensable
to
vision
the
ultimate
object
of
the
instrument
if
not
wholly
lost
must
necessarily
have
become
obscure
in
direct
proportion
to
the
acuteness
of
this
sensibility
the
hand
of
the
musician
could
scarcely
have
executed
its
varied
and
rapid
movements
upon
his
instrument
had
his
mind
been
occupied
at
one
and
the
same
instant
with
the
process
of
muscular
contraction
in
the
finger
and
the
idea
of
music
in
the
brain
had
the
communication
of
such
a
twofold
consciousness
been
possible
in
no
respect
would
it
have
been
beneficial
in
many
it
would
have
been
highly
pernicious
and
the
least
of
the
evils
resulting
from
it
would
have
been
that
the
inferior
would
have
interrupted
the
superior
faculty
and
the
means
deteriorated
the
end
but
in
some
cases
the
evil
would
have
been
of
a
much
more
serious
nature
had
we
been
rendered
sensible
of
the
flow
of
the
vital
current
through
the
engine
that
propels
it
were
the
distension
of
the
delicate
valves
that
direct
the
current
ever
present
to
our
view
by
some
inward
feeling
were
we
reminded
minute
by
minute
of
the
progress
of
the
aliment
through
the
digestive
apparatus
and
were
the
mysterious
operations
of
the
organic
nerves
palpable
to
sight
the
terror
of
the
maniac
who
conceived
that
his
body
was
composed
of
unannealed
glass
would
be
the
ordinary
feeling
of
life
every
movement
would
be
a
matter
of
anxious
deliberation
and
the
approach
of
every
body
to
our
own
would
fill
us
with
dismay
but
adjusted
as
our
consciousness
actually
is
invariably
the
point
at
which
the
organic
process
begins
is
that
at
which
sensation
ends
had
sensation
been
extended
beyond
this
point
it
would
have
been
productive
of
pain
at
this
point
it
uniformly
stops
nevertheless
by
the
indirect
connexion
of
sensation
with
the
organic
processes
a
vast
amount
of
pleasure
might
be
created
a
special
apparatus
is
constructed
for
the
express
purpose
of
establishing
the
communication
there
is
thus
the
twofold
proof
the
positive
and
the
negative
the
evidence
arising
as
well
from
what
they
do
as
from
what
they
abstain
from
doing
that
the
organic
processes
are
and
are
intended
to
be
sources
of
enjoyment
but
the
production
of
pleasure
commencing
at
this
the
lowest
point
of
conscious
existence
increases
with
the
progressive
advancement
of
organization
and
function
the
appetite
for
food
and
the
voluntary
actions
dependent
upon
it
may
be
considered
as
the
first
advancement
beyond
a
process
purely
organic
the
function
by
which
new
matter
is
introduced
into
the
system
and
converted
into
nutriment
is
partly
an
animal
and
partly
an
organic
operation
the
animal
part
of
it
consists
of
the
sensations
of
hunger
and
thirst
by
which
we
are
taught
when
the
wants
of
the
system
require
a
fresh
supply
of
aliment
together
with
the
voluntary
actions
by
which
the
aliment
is
introduced
into
the
system
the
organic
part
of
the
function
consists
of
the
changes
which
the
aliment
undergoes
after
its
introduction
into
the
system
by
which
it
is
converted
into
nutriment
sensations
always
of
a
pleasurable
nature
arise
indirectly
in
the
manner
already
explained
from
the
due
performance
of
the
organic
part
of
the
function
but
pleasure
is
also
directly
produced
by
the
performance
of
the
animal
part
of
it
wholesome
food
is
grateful
the
satisfaction
of
the
appetite
for
food
is
pleasurable
food
is
necessary
to
the
support
of
life
but
it
is
not
indispensable
to
the
maintenance
of
life
that
food
should
be
agreeable
appetite
there
must
be
that
food
may
be
eaten
but
the
act
of
eating
might
have
been
secured
without
connecting
it
with
pleasure
pleasure
however
is
connected
with
it
first
directly
by
the
gratefulness
of
food
and
secondly
indirectly
by
the
due
digestion
of
the
food
and
the
annexation
of
pleasure
in
this
twofold
mode
to
the
performance
of
the
function
of
nutrition
is
another
case
of
the
gratuitous
bestowment
of
pleasure
another
instance
in
which
pleasure
is
communicated
for
its
own
sake
and
rested
in
as
an
ultimate
object
pleasures
of
this
class
are
sometimes
called
low
they
are
comparatively
low
but
they
are
not
the
less
pleasures
because
they
are
exceeded
in
value
by
pleasures
of
a
nobler
nature
man
may
regard
them
with
comparative
indifference
because
he
is
endowed
with
faculties
which
afford
him
gratifications
superior
in
kind
and
larger
in
amount
but
it
is
no
mark
of
wisdom
to
despise
and
neglect
even
these
for
they
are
annexed
to
the
exercise
of
a
function
which
is
the
first
to
exalt
us
above
a
merely
organic
existence
they
are
the
first
pleasures
of
which
considered
merely
as
sentient
creatures
we
are
susceptible
they
amount
in
the
aggregate
to
an
immense
sum
and
they
mark
the
depth
in
our
nature
in
which
are
laid
the
fountains
of
enjoyment
organs
of
sense
intellectual
faculties
social
affections
moral
powers
are
superadded
endowments
of
a
successively
higher
order
at
the
same
time
they
are
the
instruments
of
enjoyment
of
a
nature
progressively
more
and
more
exquisite
an
organ
of
sense
is
an
instrument
composed
of
a
peculiar
arrangement
of
organized
matter
by
which
it
is
adapted
to
receive
from
specific
agents
definite
impressions
between
the
agent
that
produces
and
the
organ
that
receives
the
impression
the
adaptation
is
such
that
the
result
of
their
mutual
action
is
in
the
first
place
the
production
of
sensation
and
in
the
second
place
the
production
of
pleasure
the
pleasure
is
as
much
the
result
as
the
sensation
this
is
true
of
the
eye
in
seeing
the
ear
in
hearing
the
hand
in
touching
the
organ
of
smell
in
smelling
and
the
tongue
in
tasting
pleasure
is
linked
with
the
sense
but
there
might
have
been
the
sense
without
the
pleasure
a
slight
difference
in
the
construction
of
the
organ
or
in
the
intensity
of
the
agent
would
not
merely
have
changed
it
would
even
have
reversed
the
result
would
have
rendered
the
habitual
condition
of
the
eye
the
ear
the
skin
not
such
as
it
now
is
in
health
but
such
as
it
is
in
the
state
of
inflammation
but
the
adjustment
is
such
as
habitually
to
secure
that
condition
of
the
system
in
which
every
action
that
excites
sensation
produces
pleasure
as
its
ordinary
concomitant
and
the
amount
of
enjoyment
which
is
thus
secured
to
every
man
and
which
every
man
without
exception
actually
experiences
in
the
ordinary
course
of
an
ordinary
life
it
would
be
beyond
his
power
to
estimate
were
he
always
sensible
of
the
boon
but
the
calculation
is
altogether
impossible
when
as
is
generally
the
case
he
merely
enjoys
without
ever
thinking
of
the
provisions
which
enable
him
to
do
so
but
if
the
pleasures
that
arise
from
the
ordinary
operations
of
sense
form
in
the
aggregate
an
incalculable
sum
how
great
is
the
accession
brought
to
this
stock
by
the
endowments
next
in
order
in
the
ascending
scale
namely
the
intellectual
faculties
there
is
one
effect
resulting
from
the
operation
of
the
intellectual
faculties
on
the
senses
that
deserves
particular
attention
the
higher
faculties
elevate
the
subordinate
in
such
a
manner
as
to
make
them
altogether
new
endowments
in
illustration
of
this
it
will
suffice
to
notice
the
change
wrought
as
if
in
the
very
nature
of
sensation
the
moment
it
becomes
combined
with
an
intellectual
operation
as
exemplified
in
the
difference
between
the
intellectual
conception
of
beauty
and
the
mere
perception
of
sense
the
grouping
of
the
hills
that
bound
that
magnificent
valley
which
i
behold
at
this
moment
spread
out
before
my
view
the
shadow
of
the
trees
at
the
base
of
some
of
them
stretching
its
deep
and
varied
outline
up
the
sides
of
others

glancing
light
now
brightening
a
hundred
different
hues
of
green
on
the
broad
meadows

now
dancing

the
upland
fallows
the
clouds
the
scented
air
the
song
of
birds
the
still
more
touching
music
which
the
breeze
awakens
in
the
scarcely
trembling
branches
of
those
pine
trees
elements
of
which
this
scene
is
composed
the
mere
objects
of
sense
the
sun
the
sky
the
air
the
hills
the
woods
and
the
sounds
poured
out
from
them
impress
the
senses
of
the
animals
that
graze
in
the
midst
of
them
but
on
their
senses
they
fall
dull
and
without
effect
exciting
no
perception
of
their
loveliness
and
giving
no
taste
of
the
pleasures
they
are
capable
of
affording
nor
even
in
the
human
being
whose
intellectual
faculties
have
been
uncultivated
do
they
awaken
either
emotions
or
ideas
the
clown
sees
them
hears
them
feels
them
no
more
than
the
herds
he
tends
yet
in
him
whose
mind
has
been
cultivated
and
unfolded
how
numerous
and
varied
the
impressions
how
manifold
the
combinations
how
exquisite
the
pleasures
produced
by
objects
such
as
these
and
from
the
more
purely
intellectual
operations
from
memory
comparison

induction
how
still
nobler
the
pleasure
not
to
speak
of
the
happiness
of
him
who
by
his
study
of
natural
phenomena
at
length
arrived
at
the
stupendous
discovery
that
the
earth
and
all
the
stars
of
the
firmament
move
and
that
the
feather
falls
to
the
ground
by
the
operation
of
one
and
the
same
physical
law
nor
of
the
happiness
of
him
who
sent
his
kite
into
the
cloud
and
brought
down
from
its
quiet
bed
the
lightning
which
he
suspected
was
slumbering
there
nor
of
the
happiness
of
him
who
concentrated
directed
and
controlled
that
mighty
power
which
has
enabled
the
feeble
hand
of
man
to
accomplish

that

by

of

and

the

of

as

and
bentham
can
be
only
by

who
possess

and
who
put
forth
equal
intellectual
energy
to
be
greatly
happy
as
they
were
it
were

to
be
as

but
to
be
happy
it
is
not
necessary
to
be
so
endowed
in
the
ordinary
intellectual
operations
of
ordinary
men
in
their
ordinary
occupations
there
is
happiness
every
human
being
whose
moments
have
passed
with
winged
speed
whose
day
has
been
short
whose
year
is
gone
almost
as
soon
as
it

has
derived
from
the
exercise
of
his
intellectual
faculties
pleasures
countless
in
number
and
inestimable
in
value
but
the
sympathetic
pleasures
out
of
which
grow
the
social
are
of
a
still
higher
order
even
than
the
intellectual
the
pleasures
that
result
from
the
action
of
the
organic
organs
from
the
exercise
of
the
several
senses
and
from
the
operation
of
the
intellectual
faculties
like
the
sensations
in
which
they
arise
belong
exclusively
to
the
individual
being
that
experiences
them
and
can
not
be
communicated
to
another
similar
sensations
and
pleasures
may
be
felt
by
beings
similarly
constituted
but
the
actual
sensations
and
pleasures
afforded
by
the
exercise
of
a
person
own
organs
and
faculties
are
no
more
capable
of
becoming
another
than
his
existence
these
then
are
strictly
the
selfish
pleasures
and
the
provision
that
has
been
made
for
securing
them
has
been
shown
but
there
are
pleasures
of
another
class
pleasures
having
no
relation
whatever
to
a
person
own
sensation
or
happiness
pleasures
springing
from
the
perception
of
the
enjoyment
of
others
the
sight
of
pleasure
not
its
own
affects
the
human
heart
provided
its
state
of
feeling
be
natural
and
sound
just
as
it
would
be
affected
were
it
its
own
not
more
real
is
the
pleasure
arising
from
the
gratification
of
appetite
the
exercise
of
sense
and
the
operation
of
intellect
than
that
arising
from
the
consciousness
that
another
sentient
being
is
happy
pleasures
of
this
class
are
called
sympathetic
in
contradistinction
to
those
of
the
former
class
which
are
termed
selfish
there
are
then
two
principles
in
continual
operation
in
the
human
being
the
selfish
and
the
sympathetic
the
selfish
is
productive
of
pleasure
of
a
certain
kind
the
sympathetic
is
productive
of
pleasure
of
another
kind
the
selfish
is
primary
and
essential
the
sympathetic
arising
out
of
the
selfish
is
superadded
to
it
and
so
precisely
what
the
animal
life
is
to
the
organic
the
sympathetic
principle
is
to
the
selfish
and
just
what
the
organic
life
gains
by
its
union
with
the
animal
the
mental
constitution
gains
by
the
addition
of
the
sympathetic
to
the
selfish
affection
the
analogy
between
the
combination
in
both
cases
is
in
every
respect
complete
as
the
organic
life
produces
and
sustains
the
animal
so
the
sympathetic
principle
is
produced
and
sustained
by
the
selfish
as
the
organic
life
is
conservative
of
the
entire
organization
of
the
body
so
the
selfish
principle
is
conservative
of
the
entire
being
as
the
animal
life
is
superadded
to
the
organic
extending
exalting
and
perfecting
it
so
the
sympathetic
principle
is
superadded
to
the
selfish
equally
extending
exalting
and
perfecting
it
the
animal
life
is
nobler
than
the
organic
whence
the
organic
is
subservient
to
the
animal
but
there
is
not
only
no
opposition
hostility
or
antagonism
between
them
but
the
strictest
possible
connexion
dependence
and
subservience
the
sympathetic
principle
is
nobler
than
the
selfish
whence
the
selfish
is
subservient
to
the
sympathetic
but
there
is
not
only
no
opposition
hostility
or
antagonism
between
them
but
the
strictest
possible
connexion
dependence
and
subservience
whatever
is
conducive
to
the
perfection
of
the
organic
is
equally
conducive
to
the
perfection
of
the
animal
life
and
whatever
is
conducive
to
the
attainment
of
the
true
end
of
the
selfish
is
equally
conducive
to
the
attainment
of
the
true
end
of
the
sympathetic
principle
the
perfection
of
the
animal
life
can
not
be
promoted
at
the
expense
of
the
organic
nor
that
of
the
organic
at
the
expense
of
the
animal
neither
can
the
ultimate
end
of
the
selfish
principle
be
secured
by
the
sacrifice
of
the
sympathetic
nor
that
of
the
sympathetic
by
the
sacrifice
of
the
selfish
any
attempt
to
exalt
the
animal
life
beyond
what
is
compatible
with
the
healthy
state
of
the
organic
instead
of
accomplishing
that
end
only
produces
bodily
disease
any
attempt
to
extend
the
selfish
principle
beyond
what
is
compatible
with
the
perfection
of
the
sympathetic
or
the
sympathetic
beyond
what
is
compatible
with
the
perfection
of
the
selfish
instead
of
accomplishing
the
end
in
view
only
produces
mental
disease
opposing
and
jarring
actions
antagonizing
and
mutually
destructive
powers
are
combined
in
no
other
work
of
nature
and
it
would
be
wonderful
indeed
were
the
only
instance
of
it
found
in
man
the
noblest
of
her
works
and
in
the
mind
of
man
the
noblest
part
of
her
noblest
work
no
one
supposes
that
there
is
any
such
inharmonious
combination
in
the
organization
of
his
physical
frame
and
the
notion
that
it
exists
in
his
mental
constitution
as
it
is
founded
in
the
grossest
ignorance
so
it
is
productive
of
incalculable
mischief
in
both
indeed
are
manifest
two
great
powers
each
distinct
each
having
its
own
peculiar
operation
and
the
one
being
subservient
to
the
other
but
both
conducing
alike
to
one
common
end
by
the
addition
of
the
apparatus
of
the
animal
to
that
of
the
organic
life
a
nobler
structure
is
built
up
than
could
have
been
framed
by
the
organic
alone
by
the
addition
of
the
sympathetic
to
the
selfish
part
of
the
mental
constitution
a
happier
being
is
formed
than
could
have
been
produced
by
the
selfish
alone
and
as
the
organic
might
have
existed
without
the
animal
life
but
by
the
addition
of
the
animal
a
new
and
superior
being
is
formed
so
might
the
selfish
part
of
the
mental
constitution
and
the
pleasures
that
flow
from
it
have
existed
alone
but
by
the
addition
of
the
sympathetic
a
sum
is
added
to
enjoyment
of
the
amount
of
which
some
conception
may
be
formed
by
considering
what
human
life
would
be
with
every
selfish
appetite
and
faculty
gratified
in
the
fullest
conceivable
degree
but
without
any
admixture
whatever
of
sympathetic
or
social
pleasure
selfish
enjoyment
is
not
common
if
any
one
set
himself
to
examine
what
at
first
view
might
seem
a
purely
selfish
pleasure
he
will
soon
be
sensible
that
of
the
elements
composing
any
given
state
of
mind
to
which
he
would
be
willing
to
affix
the
term
pleasurable
a
vast
preponderance
consists
of
sympathetic
associations
the
more
accurately
he
examine
and
the
farther
he
carry
his
analysis
the
stronger
will
become
his
conviction
that
a
purely
selfish
enjoyment
that
is
a
truly
pleasurable
state
of
mind
in
no
degree
mediately
or
immediately
connected
with
the
pleasurable
state
of
another
mind
is
exceedingly
rare
but
if
the
constitution
of
human
nature
and
the
structure
of
human
society
alike
render
it
difficult
for
the
human
heart
to
be
affected
with
a
pleasure
in
no
degree
derived
and
totally
unconnected
with
sympathetic
association
of
that
complex
pleasure
which
arises
out
of
social
intercourse
partly
selfish
and
partly
sympathetic
how
far
sweeter
the
sympathetic
than
the
selfish
part
and
as
the
sympathetic
preponderates
over
the
selfish
how
vast
the
increase
of
the
pleasure
and
when
matured
exalted
into
that
holy
emotion
which
exerts
a
transforming
influence
over
the
selfish
part
of
human
nature
turning
it
into
the
sympathetic
affection
which
renders
the
happiness
of
the
beloved
object
inexpressibly
dearer
to
the
heart
than
its
own
affection
among
the
benignant
feelings
of
which
as
there
is
none
sweeter
so
there
is
none
stronger
than
that
of
nay
sometimes
even
of
affection
which
is
sympathy
pure
concentrated
how
beautiful
is
the
constitution
of
this
part
of
our
nature
by
which
the
most
transporting
pleasures
the
heart
receives
are
the
direct
reflection
of
those
it
gives
nor
ought
it
to
be
overlooked
that
while
nearly
all
the
selfish
like
all
the
sensual
pleasures
can
not
be
increased
beyond
a
fixed
limit
can
not
be
protracted
beyond
a
given
time
are
in
proportion
as
they
are
intense
and
satiate
the
appetite
they
gratify
the
sympathetic
pleasures
are
capable
of
indefinite
augmentation
are
absolutely
inexhaustible
no
limit
can
be
set
to
their
number
and
no
bound
to
their
growth
they
excite
the
appetite
they
gratify
they
multiply
with
and
by
participation
and
the
more
is
taken
from
the
fountain
from
which
they
flow
the
deeper
the
broader
and
the
fuller
the
fountain
itself
becomes
but
not
only
is
the
mental
state
of
affection
in
all
its
forms
and
degrees
highly
pleasurable
but
the
very
consciousness
of
being
the
object
of
affection
is
another
pleasure
perfectly
distinct
from
that
arising
immediately
from
the
affection
itself
it
has
been
said
of
charity
that
it
is
twice
blessed
that
it
blesses
alike
him
that
gives
and
him
that
receives
but
love
has
in
it
a
threefold
blessing
first
in
the
mental
state
itself
secondly
in
the
like
mental
state
which
the
manifestation
of
it
produces
in
another
and
thirdly
in
the
mental
state
inseparable
from
the
consciousness
of
being
the
object
of
affection
and
this
reflex
happiness
this
happiness
arising
from
the
consciousness
of
being
the
object
is
even
sweeter
than
any
connected
with
being
the
subject
of
affection
in
like
manner
there
is
pleasure
in
the
performance
of
beneficent
actions
in
energetic
constant
and
therefore
ultimately
successful
exertions
to
advance
the
great
interests
of
human
kind
in
art
in
science
in
philosophy
in
education
in
morals
in
legislation
in
government
whether
those
exertions
are
put
forth
in
the
study
the
school
the
senate
or
any
less
observed
though
perhaps
not
less
arduous
nor
less
important
field
of
labour
exertions
of
this
kind
beget
in
those
for
whom
towards
those
by
whom
they
are
made
benignant
veneration
gratitude
love
with
such
feelings
the
philosopher
the
instructor
the
legislator
the
statesman
the
philanthropist
knows
that
he
is
or
that
sooner
or
later
he
will
be
regarded
by
his
fellow
men
and
in
this
consciousness
there
is
happiness
but
this
is
another
source
of
happiness
perfectly
distinct
from
that
arising
from
the
performance
of
beneficent
actions
it
is
a
new
happiness
superadded
to
the
former
and
if
possible
still
more
exquisite
thus
manifold
is
the
beneficent
operation
of
the
sympathetic
affection
thus
admirable
is
the
provision
made
in
the
constitution
of
our
nature
for
the
excitement
and
extension
of
this
affection
and
through
its
instrumentality
for
the
multiplication
and
exaltation
of
enjoyment
in
affections
and
actions
of
the
class
just
referred
to
and
in
the
pleasures
that
result
from
them
there
is
much
of
the
nature
which
is
commonly
termed
moral
and
the
power
to
which
the
moral
affections
and
actions
are
referred
is
usually
and
justly
considered
as
the
supreme
faculty
of
the
mind
for
it
is
the
regulator
and
guide
of
all
the
others
it
is
that
by
which
they
attain
their
proper
and
ultimate
object
of
whatever
pleasure
human
nature
is
capable
in
sensation
in
idea
in
appetite
in
passion
in
emotion
in
affection
in
action
whatever
is
productive
of
real
pleasure
in
contradistinction
to
what
only
cheats
with
the
false
hope
of
pleasure
whatever
is
productive
of
pure
pleasure
in
contradistinction
to
what
is
productive
partly
of
pleasure
and
partly
of
pain
and
consequently
productive
not
of
pure
but
of
mixed
pleasure
whatever
is
productive
of
a
great
degree
of
pleasure
in
contradistinction
to
what
is
productive
of
a
small
degree
of
pleasure
whatever
is
productive
of
lasting
pleasure
in
contradistinction
to
what
is
productive
of
temporary
pleasure
whatever
is
productive
of
ultimate
pleasure
in
contradistinction
to
what
is
productive
of
immediate
pleasure
but
ultimate
pain
this
greatest
and
most
perfect
pleasure
it
is
the
part
of
the
moral
faculty
to
discover
in
the
degree
in
which
the
operation
of
this
faculty
is
correct
and
complete
it
enables
the
human
being
to
derive
from
every
faculty
of
his
nature
the
greatest
the
purest
the
most
enduring
pleasure
that
is
the
maximum
of
felicity
this
is
the
proper
scope
and
aim
of
the
moral
faculty
to
this
its
right
exercise
is
uniformly
conducive
and
this
as
it
is
better
cultivated
and
directed
it
will
accomplish
in
a
higher
degree
in
a
continual
progression
to
which
no
limit
can
be
assigned
but
if
the
operation
of
this
faculty
be
to
render
every
other
in
the
highest
degree
conducive
to
happiness
conformity
to
the
course
of
conduct
required
by
it
must
of
course
be
that
highest
happiness
conformity
to
the
course
of
conduct
pointed
out
by
the
moral
faculty
as
conducive
in
the
highest
degree
to
happiness
is
moral
excellence
or
in
the
definite
and
exact
sense
of
the
word
virtue
and
in
this
sense
it
is
that
virtue
is
happiness
it
is
because
it
discriminates
the
true
sources
of
happiness
that
is
directs
every
other
faculty
into
its
proper
course
and
guides
it
in
that
course
to
the
attainment
of
its
ultimate
object
that
the
moral
faculty
is
ranked
as
the
highest
faculty
of
the
mind
supposing
the
operation
of
this
faculty
to
be
perfect
it
is
but
an
identical
expression
to
say
that
to
follow
its
guidance
implicitly
is
to
follow
the
road
that
leads
to
the
most
perfect
happiness
but
over
and
above
the
happiness
thus
directly
and
necessarily
resulting
from
yielding
uniform
and
implicit
obedience
to
the
moral
faculty
there
is
in
the
very
consciousness
of
such
conformity
a
new
happiness
as
pure
as
it
is
exalted
thus
in
a
twofold
manner
is
the
moral
the
highest
faculty
of
the
mind
the
source
of
its
highest
happiness
and
thus
manifest
it
is
from
every
view
that
can
be
taken
of
the
constitution
of
human
nature
that
every
faculty
with
which
it
is
endowed
from
the
highest
to
the
lowest
not
only
affords
its
own
proper
and
peculiar
pleasure
but
that
each
as
it
successively
rises
in
the
scale
is
proportionately
the
source
of
a
nobler
kind
and
a
larger
amount
of
enjoyment
and
the
pleasure
afforded
by
the
various
faculties
with
which
the
human
being
is
endowed
is
the
immediate
and
direct
result
of
their
exercise
with
the
exception
of
the
organic
organs
and
the
reason
for
the
exception
in
regard
to
them
has
been
assigned
the
action
of
the
organs
is
directly
pleasurable
from
the
exercise
of
the
organs
of
sense
from
the
operation
of
the
intellectual
faculties
from
appetite
passion
and
affection
pleasure
flows
as
directly
as
the
object
for
which
the
instrument
is
expressly
framed
and
pleasure
is
the
ordinary
result
of
the
action
of
the
organs
pain
is
sometimes
the
result
but
it
is
the
extraordinary
not
the
ordinary
result
whatever
may
be
the
degree
of
pain
occasionally
produced
or
however
protracted
its
duration
yet
it
is
never
the
natural
that
is
the
usual
or
permanent
state
either
of
a
single
organ
or
of
an
apparatus
or
of
the
system
the
usual
the
permanent
the
natural
condition
of
each
organ
and
of
the
entire
system
is
pleasurable
abstracting
therefore
from
the
aggregate
amount
of
pleasure
the
aggregate
amount
of
pain
the
balance
in
favour
of
pleasure
is
immense
this
is
true
of
the
ordinary
experience
of
ordinary
men
even
taking
their
physical
and
mental
states
such
as
they
are
at
present
but
the
ordinary
physical
and
mental
states
considered
as
sources
of
pleasure
of
every
human
being
might
be
prodigiously
improved
and
some
attempt
will
be
made
in
a
subsequent
part
of
this
work
to
show
in
what
manner
and
to
what
extent
it
has
been
already
stated
that
there
are
cases
in
which
pleasure
is
manifestly
given
for
its
own
sake
in
which
it
is
rested
in
as
an
ultimate
object
but
the
converse
is
never
found
in
no
case
is
the
excitement
of
pain
gratuitous
among
all
the
examples
of
secretion
there
is
no
instance
of
a
fluid
the
object
of
which
is
to
irritate
and
inflame
among
all
the
actions
of
the
economy
there
is
none
the
object
of
which
is
the
production
of
pain
moreover
all
such
action
of
the
organs
as
is
productive
of
pleasure
is
conducive
to
their
complete
development
and
consequently
to
the
increase
of
their
capacity
for
producing
pleasure
while
all
such
action
of
the
organs
as
is
productive
of
pain
is
preventive
of
their
complete
development
and
consequently
diminishes
their
capacity
for
producing
pain
the
natural
tendency
of
pleasure
is
to
its
own
augmentation
and
perpetuity
pain
on
the
contrary
is
special
provision
is
made
in
the
economy
for
preventing
pain
from
passing
beyond
a
certain
limit
and
from
enduring
beyond
a
certain
time
pain
when
it
reaches
a
certain
intensity
deadens
the
sensibility
of
the
sentient
nerve
and
when
it
lasts
beyond
a
certain
time
it
excites
new
actions
in
the
organ
affected
by
which
the
organ
is
either
restored
to
a
sound
state
or
so
changed
in
structure
that
its
function
is
wholly
abolished
but
change
of
structure
and
abolition
of
function
if
extensive
and
permanent
are
incompatible
with
the
continuance
of
life
if
then
the
actions
of
the
economy
excited
by
pain
fail
to
put
an
end
to
suffering
by
restoring
the
diseased
organ
to
a
healthy
state
they
succeed
in
putting
an
end
to
it
by
terminating
life
pain
therefore
can
not
be
so
severe
and
lasting
as
materially
to
preponderate
over
pleasure
without
soon
proving
destructive
to
life
but
the
very
reverse
is
the
case
with
pleasure
all
such
action
of
the
organs
as
is
productive
of
pleasure
is
conducive
to
the
perpetuation
of
life
there
is
a
close
connexion
between
happiness
and
longevity
enjoyment
is
not
only
the
end
of
life
but
it
is
the
only
condition
of
life
which
is
compatible
with
a
protracted
term
of
existence
the
happier
a
human
being
is
the
longer
he
lives
the
more
he
suffers
the
sooner
he
dies
to
add
to
enjoyment
is
to
lengthen
life
to
inflict
pain
is
to
shorten
the
duration
of
existence
as
there
is
a
point
of
wretchedness
beyond
which
life
is
not
desirable
so
there
is
a
point
beyond
which
it
is
not
maintainable
the
man
who
has
reached
an
advanced
age
can
not
have
been
upon
the
whole
an
unhappy
being
for
the
infirmity
and
suffering
which
embitter
life
cut
it
short
every
document
by
which
the
rate
of
mortality
among
large
numbers
of
human
beings
can
be
correctly
ascertained
contains
in
it
irresistible
evidence
of
this
truth
in
every
country
the
average
duration
of
life
whether
for
the
whole
people
or
for
particular
classes
is
invariably
in
the
direct
ratio
of
their
means
of
felicity
while
on
the
other
hand
the
number
of
years
which
large
portions
of
the
population
survive
beyond
the
adult
age
may
be
taken
as
a
certain
test
of
the
happiness
of
the
community
how
clear
must
have
been
the
perception
of
this
in
the
mind
of
the
jewish
legislator
when
he
made
the
promise
that
thy
days
may
be
long
in
the
land
which
the
lord
thy
god
hath
given
sanction
of
every
religious
observance
and
the
motive
to
every
moral
duty
deeply
then
are
laid
the
fountains
of
happiness
in
the
constitution
of
human
nature
they
spring
from
the
depths
of
man
physical
organization
and
from
the
wider
range
of
his
mental
constitution
they
flow
in
streams
magnificent
and
glorious
it
is
conceivable
that
from
the
first
to
the
last
moment
of
his
existence
every
human
being
might
drink
of
them
to
the
full
extent
of
his
capacity
why
does
he
not
the
answer
will
be
found
in
that
to
the
following
question
what
must
happen
before
this
be
possible
the
attainment
of
clear
and
just
conceptions
on
subjects
in
relation
to
which
the
knowledge
hitherto
acquired
by
the
most
enlightened
men
is
imperfect
physical
nature
every
department
of
it
at
least
which
is
capable
of
influencing
human
existence
and
human
sensation
human
nature
both
the
physical
and
the
mental
part
of
it
institutions
so
adapted
to
that
nature
as
to
be
capable
of
securing
to
every
individual
and
to
the
whole
community
the
maximum
of
happiness
with
the
minimum
of
must
be
known
but
knowledge
of
this
kind
is
of
slow
growth
to
expect
the
possession
of
it
on
the
part
of
any
man
in
such
a
stage
of
civilization
as
the
present
is
to
suppose
a
phenomenon
to
which
there
is
nothing
analogous
in
the
history
of
the
human
mind
the
human
mind
is
equally
incapable
of
making
a
violent
discovery
in
any
department
of
knowledge
and
of
taking
a
violent
bound
in
any
path
of
improvement
what
we
call
discoveries
and
improvements
are
clear
decided
but
for
the
most
part
gentle
steps
in
advancement
of
the
actual
and
state
of
knowledge
the
human
mind
unravels
the
great
chain
of
knowledge
link
by
link
when
it
is
no
longer
able
to
trace
the
connecting
link
it
is
at
a
stand
the
discoverer
in
common
with
his
contemporaries
seeing
the
last
ascertained
link
and
from
that
led
on
by
analogies
which
are
not
perceived
by
or
which
do
not
impress
others
at
length
descries
the
next
in
succession
this
brings
into
view
new
analogies
and
so
prepares
the
way
for
the
discernment
of
another
link
this
again
elicits
other
analogies
which
lead
to
the
detection
of
other
links
and
so
the
chain
is
lengthened
and
no
link
once
made
out
is
lost
chemists
tell
us
that
the
adjustment
of
the
component
elements
of
water
is
such
that
although
they
readily
admit
of
separation
and
are
subservient
to
their
most
important
uses
in
the
economy
of
nature
by
this
very
facility
of
decomposition
yet
that
their
tendency
to
recombination
is
equal
so
that
the
quantity
of
water
actually
existing
at
this
present
moment
in
the
globe
is
just
the
same
as
on
the
first
day
of
the
creation
neither
the
operations
of
nature
nor
the
purposes
to
which
it
has
been
applied
by
man
having
used
up
in
the
sense
of
destroying
a
single
particle
of
it
alike
indestructible
are
the
separate
truths
that
make
up
the
great
mass
of
human
knowledge
in
their
ready
divisibility
and
their
manifold
applications
some
of
them
may
sometimes
seem
to
be
lost
but
if
they
disappear
it
is
only
to
enter
into
new
combinations
many
of
which
themselves
become
new
truths
and
so
ultimately
extend
the
boundaries
of
knowledge
whatever
may
have
been
the
case
in
time
past
when
the
loss
of
an
important
truth
satisfactorily
and
practically
established
may
be
supposed
possible
such
an
event
is
inconceivable
now
when
the
art
of
printing
at
once
multiplies
a
thousand
records
of
it
and
with
astonishing
rapidity
makes
it
part
and
parcel
of
hundreds
of
thousands
of
minds
a
thought
more
full
of
encouragement
to
those
who
labour
for
the
improvement
of
their
fellow
beings
there
can
not
be
no
onward
step
is
lost
no
onward
step
is
final
every
such
step
facilitates
and
secures
another
the
savage
state
that
state
in
which
gross
selfishness
seeks
its
object
simply
and
directly
by
violence
is
past
the
or
barbarous
state
in
which
the
grossness
of
the
selfishness
is
somewhat
abated
and
the
violence
by
which
it
seeks
its
object
in
some
degree
mitigated
by
the
higher
faculties
and
the
gentler
affections
of
our
nature
but
in
which
war
still
predominates
is
also
past
to
this
has
succeeded
the
state
in
which
we
are
at
present
the
civilized
state
in
which
the
selfish
principle
still
predominates
in
which
the
justifiableness
of
seeking
the
accomplishment
of
selfish
purposes
by
means
of
violence
that
of
war
among
the
rest
is
still
recognized
but
in
which
violence
is
not
the
ordinary
instrument
employed
by
selfishness
its
ends
being
commonly
accomplished
by
the
more
silent
steady
and
permanent
operation
of

this

pass
away
how
soon
in
what
precise
mode
by
what
immediate
agency
none
can
tell
but
we
are
already
in
possession
of
the
principle
which
will
destroy
the

and
introduce
a

the

of

supposing
no

is

or
the

of

it
is
conceivable
that
the

condition
might
be
brought
to
a
high
degree
of
perfection
the
mind
remaining
in
a
state
but
little
fitted
for
enjoyment
because
it
is
necessary
to
enjoyment
that
there
be
a
certain
development
occupation
and
direction
of
the
mental
powers
and
affections
and
the
mental
state
may
be
neglected
while
attention
is
paid
to
the
physical
processes
but
the
converse
is
not
possible
the
mental
energies
can
not
be
fully
called
forth
while
the
physical
condition
is
neglected
happiness
presupposes
a
certain
degree
of
excellence
in
the
physical
condition
and
unless
the
physical
condition
be
brought
to
a
high
degree
of
excellence
there
can
be
no
such
development
occupation
and
direction
of
the

as
is
requisite
to
a
high
degree
of
enjoyment
that
state
of
the
system
in
which
the
physical
condition
is
sound
is
in
itself
conducive
to
enjoyment
while
a
permanent
state
of
enjoyment
is
in
its
turn
conducive
to
the
soundness
of
the
physical
condition
it
is
impossible
to
maintain
the
physical
processes
in
a
natural
and
vigorous
condition
if
the
mind
be
in
a
state
of
suffering
the
bills
of

contain
no
column
exhibiting
the
number
of
persons
who
perish
annually
from
bodily
disease
produced
by
mental
suffering
but
every
one
must
occasionally
have
seen
appalling
examples
of
the
fact
every
one
must
have
observed
the
altered
appearance
of
persons
who
have
sustained
calamity
a
misfortune
that
struck
to
the
heart
happened
to
a
person
a
year
ago
observe
him
some
time
afterwards
he
is
wasted
worn
the
miserable
shadow
of
himself
inquire
about
him
at
the
distance
of
a
few
months
he
is
no
more
it
is
stated
by
villermé
that
the
ordinary
rate
of
mortality
in
the
prisons
of
france
taking
all
together
is
one
in
rate
which
corresponds
to
the
age
of
in
the
common
course
of
life
but
in
the
vast
majority
of
cases
the
unfortunate
victims
of
the
law
are
no
older
than
from
to
years
of
age
taking
them
at
the
mean
age
of
it
follows
that
the
suffering
from
imprisonment
and
from
the
causes
that
lead
to
it
is
equivalent
to
thirty
years
wear
and
tear
of
life
but
this
is
not
all
for
it
is
found
that
during
imprisonment
the
ordinary
chances
of
death
are
exactly
quadrupled
in
regard
to
the
whole
population
of
a
country
indigence
may
be
assumed
to
be
a
fair
measure
of
unhappiness
and
wealth
of
happiness
if
the
rate
of
mortality
in
the
indigent
class
be
compared
with
that
of
the
wealthy
according
to
villermé
it
will
be
found
in
some
cases
to
be
just
double
thus
it
is
affirmed
that
in
some
cases
in
france
taking
equal
numbers
where
there
are
one
hundred
deaths
in
a
poor
arrondissement
there
are
only
fifty
in
a
rich
and
that
taking
together
the
whole
of
the
french
population
human
life
is
protracted
twelve
years
and
a
half
among
the
wealthy
beyond
its
duration
among
the
poor
consequently
in
the
one
class
a
child
newly
born
has
a
probability
of
living
and
a
half
years
in
the
other
only
thirty
years
in
the
great
establishments
in
england
a
vast
proportion
of
the
persons
who
insure
their
lives
are
persons
compelled
to
do
so
by
their
creditors
while
of
those
who
voluntarily
insure
their
lives
are
professional
men
living
in
great
towns
and
experiencing
the
anxieties
and
fatigues
the
hopes
and
disappointments
of
professional
life
in
one
of
these
establishments
in
london
out
of
deaths
that
happened
in
years
preceding
the
year
it
was
found
that
eleven
died
by
suicide
being
one
in
thirty
implying
the
existence
of
an
appalling
amount
of
mental
suffering
the
number
of
persons
belonging
to
an
insurance
office
who
perish
by
suicide
is
sure
to
be
accurately
known
death
by
suicide
rendering
the
policy
void
it
would
be
most
erroneous
to
suppose
that
these
persons
put
an
end
to
their
existence
under
the
mere
influence
of
the
mental
states
of
disappointment
and
despondency
the
mind
reacted
upon
the
body
produced
physical
disease
probably
inflammation
of
the
brain
and
under
the
excitement
of
this
physical
disease
the
acts
of
suicide
were
committed
more
than
one
case
has
come
to
my
knowledge
in
which
inflammation
of
the
brain
having
been
excited
by
mental
suffering
suicide
was
committed
by
cutting
the
throat
during
the
flow
of
blood
which
was
gradual
the
brain
was
relieved
the
mind
became
perfectly
rational
and
the
patient
might
have
been
saved
had
a
surgeon
been
upon
the
spot
or
had
the
persons
about
the
patient
known
where
and
how
to
apply
the
pressure
of
the
finger
to
staunch
the
flow
of
blood
until
surgical
aid
could
be
procured
by
a
certain
amount
and
intensity
of
misery
life
may
be
suddenly
destroyed
by
a
smaller
amount
and
intensity
it
may
be
slowly
worn
out
and
exhausted
the
state
of
the
mind
affects
the
physical
condition
but
the
continuance
of
life
is
wholly
dependent
on
the
physical
condition
it
follows
that
in
the
degree
in
which
the
state
of
the
mind
is
capable
of
affecting
the
physical
condition
it
is
capable
of
influencing
the
duration
of
life
were
the
physical
condition
always
perfect
and
the
mental
state
always
that
of
enjoyment
the
duration
of
life
would
always
be
extended
to
the
utmost
limit
compatible
with
that
of
the
organization
of
the
body
but
as
this
fortunate
concurrence
seldom
or
never
happens
human
life
seldom
or
never
numbers
the
full
measure
of
its
days
uniform
experience
shows
however
that
provided
no
accident
occur
to
interrupt
the
usual
course
in
proportion
as
body
and
mind
approximate
to
this
state
life
is
long
and
as
they
recede
from
it
it
is
short
improvement
of
the
physical
condition
affords
a
foundation
for
the
improvement
of
the
mental
state
improvement
of
the
mental
state
improves
up
to
a
certain
point
the
physical
condition
and
in
the
ratio
in
which
this
twofold
improvement
is
effected
the
duration
of
life
increases
longevity
then
is
a
good
in
the
first
place
because
it
is
a
sign
and
a
consequence
of
the
possession
of
a
certain
amount
of
enjoyment
and
in
the
second
place
because
this
being
the
case
of
course
in
proportion
as
the
term
of
life
is
extended
the
sum
of
enjoyment
must
be
augmented
and
this
view
of
longevity
assigns
the
cause
and
shows
the
reasonableness
of
that
desire
for
long
life
which
is
so
universal
and
constant
as
to
be
commonly
considered
instinctive
longevity
and
happiness
if
not
invariably
are
generally
if
there
may
be
happiness
without
longevity
the
converse
is
not
possible
there
can
not
be
longevity
without
happiness
unless
the
state
of
the
body
be
that
of
tolerable
health
and
the
state
of
the
mind
that
of
tolerable
enjoyment
long
life
is
unattainable
these
physical
and
mental
conditions
no
longer
existing
nor
capable
of
existing
the
desire
of
life
and
the
power
of
retaining
it
cease
together
an
advanced
term
of
life
and
decrepitude
are
commonly
conceived
to
be
synonymous
the
extension
of
life
is
vulgarly
supposed
to
be
the
protraction
of
the
period
of
infirmity
and
suffering
that
period
which
is
characterized
by
a
progressive
diminution
of
the
power
of
sensation
and
a
consequent
and
proportionate
loss
of
the
power
of
enjoyment
the
sans
teeth
sans
eyes
sans
taste
sans
every
thing
but
this
is
so
far
from
being
true
that
it
is
not
within
the
compass
of
human
power
to
protract
in
any
sensible
degree
the
period
of
old
age
properly
so
called
that
is
the
stage
of
decrepitude
in
this
stage
of
existence
the
physical
changes
that
successively
take
place
clog
day
by
day
the
vital
machinery
until
it
can
no
longer
play
in
a
space
of
time
fixed
within
narrow
limits
the
flame
of
life
must
then
inevitably
expire
for
the
processes
that
feed
it
fail
but
though
when
fully
come
the
term
of
old
age
can
not
be
extended
the
coming
of
the
term
may
be
postponed
to
the
preceding
stage
an
indefinite
number
of
years
may
be
added
and
this
is
a
fact
of
the
deepest
interest
to
human
nature
the
division
of
human
life
into
periods
or
epochs
is
not
an
arbitrary
distinction
but
is
founded
on
constitutional
differences
in
the
system
dependent
on
different
physiological
conditions
the
periods
of
infancy
childhood
boyhood
adolescence
manhood
and
old
age
are
distinguished
from
each
other
by
external
characters
which
are
but
the
outward
signs
of
internal
states
in
physiological
condition
the
infant
differs
from
the
child
the
child
from
the
boy
the
boy
from
the
man
and
the
adult
from
the
old
man
as
much
in
physical
strength
as
in
mental
power
there
is
an
appointed
order
in
which
these
several
states
succeed
each
other
there
is
a
fixed
time
at
which
one
passes
into
another
that
order
can
not
be
inverted
no
considerable
anticipation
or
postponement
of
that
fixed
time
can
be
effected
in
all
places
and
under
all
circumstances
at
a
given
time
though
not
precisely
at
the
same
time
in
all
climates
and
under
all
modes
of
life
infancy
passes
into
childhood
childhood
into
boyhood
boyhood
into
adolescence
and
adolescence
into
manhood
in
the
space
of
two
years
from
its
birth
every
infant
has
ceased
to
be
an
infant
and
has
become
a
child
in
the
space
of
six
years
from
this
period
every
male
child
will
have
become
a
boy
add
eight
years
to
this
time
and
every
boy
will
have
become
a
young
man
in
eight
years
more
every
young
man
will
have
become
an
adult
man
and
in
the
subsequent
ten
years
every
adult
man
will
have
acquired
his
highest
state
of
physical
perfection
but
at
what
period
will
this
state
of
physical
perfection
decline
what
is
the
maximum
time
during
which
it
can
retain
its
full
vigour
is
that
maximum
fixed
is
there
a
certain
number
of
years
in
which
by
an
inevitable
law
every
adult
man
necessarily
becomes
an
old
man
is
precisely
the
same
number
of
years
appointed
for
this
transition
to
every
human
being
can
no
care
add
to
that
number
can
no
imprudence
take
from
it
does
the
physiological
condition
or
the
constitutional
age
of
any
two
individuals
ever
advance
to
precisely
the
same
point
in
precisely
the
same
number
of
years
physically
and
mentally
are
not
some
persons
older
at
fifty
than
others
are
at
seventy
and
do
not
instances
occasionally
occur
in
which
an
old
man
who
reaches
even
his
hundredth
year
retains
as
great
a
degree
of
juvenility
as
the
majority
of
those
who
attain
to
eighty
if
this
be
so
what
follows
one
of
the
most
interesting
consequences
that
can
be
presented
to
the
human
mind
the
duration
of
the
periods
of
infancy
childhood
boyhood
and
adolescence
is
fixed
by
a
determinate
number
of
years
nothing
can
stay
nothing
retard
the
succession
of
each
alike
incapable
of
any
material
protraction
is
the
period
of
old
age
it
follows
that
every
year
by
which
the
term
of
human
existence
is
extended
is
really
added
to
the
period
of
mature
age
the
period
when
the
organs
of
the
body
have
attained
their
full
growth
and
put
forth
their
full
strength
when
the
physical
organization
has
acquired
its
utmost
perfection
when
the
senses
the
feelings
the
emotions
the
passions
the
affections
are
in
the
highest
degree
acute
intense
and
varied
when
the
intellectual
faculties
completely
unfolded
and
developed
carry
on
their
operations
with
the
greatest
vigour
soundness
and
continuity
in
a
word
when
the
individual
is
capable
of
receiving
and
of
communicating
the
largest
amount
of
the
highest
kind
of
enjoyment
a
consideration
more
full
of
encouragement
more
animating
there
can
not
be
the
extension
of
human
life
in
whatever
mode
and
degree
it
may
be
possible
to
extend
it
is
the
protraction
of
that
portion
of
it
and
only
of
that
portion
of
it
in
which
the
human
being
is
capable
of
receiving
and
of
communicating
the
largest
measure
of
the
noblest
kind
of
enjoyment
considerations
purely
physiological
establish
this
indubitably
but
it
is
curious
that
a
class
of
facts
totally
different
from
those
of
a
physiological
nature
equally
prove
it
namely
the
results
obtained
from
the
observation
of
the
actual
numbers
that
die
at
different
ages
and
the
knowledge
consequently
acquired
of
the
progressive
decrement
of
life
mortality
is
subject
to
a
law
the
operation
of
which
is
as
regular
as
that
of
gravitation
the
labours
of
my
valued
friend
finlaison
the
actuary
of
the
national
debt
have
not
only
determined
what
that
law
is
in
relation
to
different
nations
at
different
periods
of
their
history
but
this
celebrated
calculator
has
also
invented
a
striking
mode
of
expressing
and
representing
the
fact
he
constructed
a
chart
on
which
perpendicular
lines
answering
to
the
respective
ages
of
human
life
are
laid
down
and
numbered
in
succession
these
are
crossed
at
right
angles
by
horizontal
lines
so
that
in
the
manner
of
musical
notation
a
point
may
be
laid
down
either
on
the
horizontal
line
or
on
the
space
between
any
two
of
them
and
thus
points
may
be
laid
down
on
each
of
the
perpendicular
lines
the
horizontal
lines
are
in
like
manner
numbered
from
to
ascending
from
the
base
taking
any
observation
which
shows
the
number
of
living
persons
that
commence
and
in
like
manner
the
number
that
die
in
each
particular
year
of
human
life
the
calculator
reduced
by
the
rule
of
three
every
such
actual
number
of
living
persons
for
every
separate
year
to
he
next
showed
the
corresponding
proportion
of
deaths
out
of
such
these
proportions
he
represented
on
the
chart
by
a
point
inserted
on
the
horizontal
line
or
space
for
the
number
of
deaths
and
on
the
perpendicular
line
for
the
particular
age
he
then
connected
all
the
points
so
laid
down
and
the
result
is
a
curve
representing
the
track
of
death
through
an
equal
number
of
human
beings
existing
at
each
age
of
life
as
the
curve
rises
on
the
perpendicular
line
at
any
given
age
it
indicates
by
so
much
an
increase
of
the
mortality
at
that
age
and
as
the
curve
falls
the
reverse
is
denoted
now
it
is
a
highly
interesting
fact
that
the
curves
on
this
chart
drawn
upon
it
before
the
physiological
phenomena
were
known
to
the
operator
placed
there
because
such
he
found
to
be
the
actual
path
along
which
death
marshals
his
course
exactly
correspond
to
the
epochs
which
physiology
teaches
to
be
determinate
stages
of
human
existence
the
infant
the
child
the
boy
the
adolescent
the
man
the
old
man
are
not
exposed
to
the
same
danger
the
liability
of
each
to
death
is
not
merely
different
it
is
widely
different
the
liability
of
each
class
is
uniformly
the
same
the
circumstances
influencing
life
remaining
the
same
and
under
no
known
change
of
circumstances
does
the
relative
liability
of
the
class
vary
under
no
change
does
the
liability
of
the
adolescent
become
that
of
the
infant
or
the
liability
of
the
adult
that
of
the
aged
take
from
any
statistical
document
any
number
of
persons
observe
out
of
this
number
the
proportion
that
dies
at
the
different
stages
just
enumerated
and
the
period
of
human
life
which
admits
of
extension
will
be
strikingly
manifest
take
with
this
view
the
prussian
statistical
tables
the
general
correctness
of
which
is
admitted
from
these
tables
it
appears
and
the
correctness
of
the
result
is
confirmed
by
a
multitude
of
other
tables
that
out
of
a
million
living
male
births
there
will
die
in
the
first
year
of
life
infants
and
out
of
the
like
number
of
living
female
births
there
will
die
infants
let
us
follow
up
the
decrement
of
life
through
the
different
epochs
of
human
existence
confining
our
observations
to
the
male
sex
in
which
the
development
is
more
emphatically
marked
in
finlaison
report
printed
by
the
house
of
commons
on
the
of
march
there
are
six
original
observations
on
the
mortality
of
as
many
separate
sets
of
annuitants
of
the
male
sex
from
an
examination
and
comparison
of
these
observations
it
that
the
rate
of
mortality
falls
to
a
minimum
at
the
close
of
the
period
of
childhood
that
from
this
point
the
mortality
rises
until
the
termination
of
adolescence
or
the
commencement
of
adult
age
that
from
the
commencement
of
adult
age
the
mortality
again
declines
and
continues
to
decline
to
the
period
of
perfect
maturity
and
that
from
the
period
of
perfect
maturity
the
mortality
rises
and
uniformly
without
a
single
exception
returns
at
the
age
of
to
the
point
at
which
it
stood
at
the
termination
of
adolescence
these
results
clearly
indicate
that
certain
fixed
periods
are
marked
by
nature
as
epochs
of
human
life
and
that
at
the
date
of
the
recorded
facts
which
furnish
the
data
for
these
observations
and
as
far
as
regards
the
class
of
persons
to
which
they
relate
the
age
of
was
the
exact
point
at
which
the
meridian
of
life
was
just
passed
and
a
new
epoch
began
the
following
table
exhibits
at
one
view
the
exact
results
of
each
of
the
observations
for
example
according
to
the
mortality
from
whence
from
this
and
from
this
the

a

it

observation
minimum
at
the

rises
but
is
not
no
age
of
the
age

the
equal
to
the
age
of
mortality
in
the
column
until
the
age
of
the
observation
no
is
founded
on
the
large
mass
of
lives
and
deaths
from
this
observation
it
appears
that
at
the
age
of
thirteen
the
mortality
out
of
a
million
is
being
less
than
in
the
first
year
of
infancy
at
the
age
of
it
is
being
more
than
at
the
close
of
childhood
at
the
age
of
the
period
of
complete
manhood
it
falls
to
being
less
than
at
the
close
of
adolescence
at
the
age
of
the
mortality
returns
to
all
but
identically
the
same
as
at
the
adult
age
from
the
age
of
when
as
has
been
stated
life
just
begins
to
decline
from
its
meridian
the
mortality
advances
slowly
but
in
a
steady
and
regular
progression
thus
at
the
age
of
it
is
being
more
than
at
the
preceding
decade
or
almost
exactly
double
at
the
age
of
it
is
being
more
than
at
the
preceding
decade
or
more
than
double
at
the
age
of
it
is
being
more
than
at
the
preceding
decade
at
the
age
of
it
is
being
more
than
at
the
preceding
decade
during
the
first
year
of
infancy
as
has
been
shown
the
mortality
out
of
a
million
is
at
the
extreme
age
of
it
is
very
nearly
the
same
as
in
the
first
year
of
infancy
greatly
as
the
mortality
of
all
the
other
epochs
of
life
is
affected
by
country
by
station
by
a
multitude
of
influences
arising
out
of
these
and
similar
circumstances
yet
the
concurrent
evidence
of
all
observation
shows
that
at
this
and
the
like
advanced
ages
the
mean
term
of
existence
is
nearly
the
same
in
all
countries
at
all
periods
and
among
all
classes
of
society
thus
among
the
nobility
and
gentry
of
england
the
expectation
of
life
at
is
four
years
among
the
poor
fishermen
of
ostend
it
is
precisely
the
same
de
parcieux
who
wrote
just
ninety
years
ago
establishes
the
expectation
of
life
at
that
time
in
france
at
the
same
age
to
have
been
three
and
a
half
years
and
halley
who
wrote
years
ago
and
whose
observations
are
derived
from
documents
which
go
back
to
the
end
of
the
seventeenth
century
states
the
expectation
of
life
at
to
be
two
years
and
nine
months
from
these
statements
then
it
is
obvious
that
from
the
termination
of
infancy
at
three
years
of
age
a
decade
of
years
brings
childhood
to
a
close
during
which
the
mortality
steadily
decreasing
comes
to
its
minimum
another
decade
terminates
the
period
of
adolescence
during
which
the
mortality
as
steadily
advances
a
third
decade
changes
the
young
adult
into
a
perfect
man
and
during
this
period
the
golden
decade
of
human
life
the
mortality
again
diminishes
while
during
another
decade
and
a
half
the
mortality
slowly
rises
and
returns
at
the
close
of
the
period
to
the
precise
point
at
which
it
stood
at
adult
age
thus
the
interval
between
the
period
of
birth
and
that
of
adult
age
includes
a
term
of
years
the
interval
between
the
period
of
adult
age
and
that
when
life
just
begins
to
decline
from
its
meridian
includes
a
term
of
years
consequently
a
period
more
than
equal
to
all
the
other
epochs
of
life
from
birth
to
adult
age
is
enjoyed
during
which
mortality
makes
no
advance
whatever
now
the
term
of
years
included
in
the
several
epochs
that
intervene
between
birth
and
adult
age
is
rigidly
fixed
thus
the
period
of
infancy
includes
precisely
three
years
that
of
childhood
ten
years
and
that
of
adolescence
ten
years
within
the
space
of
time
comprehended
in
these
intervals
physiological
changes
take
place
on
which
depend
every
thing
that
is
peculiar
to
the
epochs
these
changes
can
not
be
anticipated
can
not
be
retarded
except
in
a
very
slight
degree
in
all
countries
among
all
classes
they
take
place
in
the
same
order
and
nearly
in
the
same
space
of
time
in
like
manner
in
extreme
old
age
or
the
age
of
decrepitude
which
may
be
safely
assumed
to
commence
at
the
period
when
the
mortality
equals
that
of
the
first
year
of
infancy
namely
the
age
of
physiological
changes
take
place
which
within
a
given
space
of
time
inevitably
bring
life
to
a
close
that
space
of
time
in
all
countries
in
all
ranks
in
all
ages
or
rather
as
far
back
as
any
records
enable
us
to
trace
the
facts
appears
to
be
the
same
as
within
a
given
time
the
boy
must
ripen
into
manhood
so
within
a
given
time
the
man
of
extreme
old
age
must
be
the
victim
of
death
consequently
it
is
the
interval
between
the
adult
age
and
the
age
of
decrepitude
and
only
this
that
is
capable
of
extension
during
the
interval
between
adult
age
and
the
perfect
meridian
of
life
comprehending
at
present
as
we
have
seen
a
period
of
years
the
constitution
remains
stationary
mortality
making
no
sensible
inroad
upon
it
but
there
is
no
known
reason
why
this
stationary
or
mature
period
of
life
should
like
the
determinate
epochs
be
limited
to
a
fixed
term
of
years
on
the
contrary
we
do
in
fact
know
that
it
is
not
fixed
for
we
know
that
the
physiological
changes
on
which
age
depends
are
in
some
cases
greatly
anticipated
and
in
others
proportionately
postponed
so
that
some
persons
are
younger
at
sixty
and
even
at
seventy
than
others
are
at
fifty
whereas
an
analogous
anticipation
or
postponement
of
the
other
epochs
of
life
is
never
witnessed
so
complete
is
the
proof
that
the
extension
of
human
life
can
consist
in
the
protraction
neither
of
the
period
of
juvenility
nor
in
that
of
senility
but
only
in
that
of
maturity
were
it
necessary
to
adduce
further
evidence
of
this
most
interesting
fact
it
would
be
found
equally
in
the
statistics
of
disease
as
in
those
of
mortality
indeed
the
evidence
derived
from
both
these
sources
must
be
analogous
because
mortality
is
invariably
proportionate
to
the
causes
of
mortality
of
which
causes
sickness
in
all
its
forms
may
be
taken
as
the
general
or
collective
expression
we
do
not
possess
the
same
means
of
illustrating
the
prevalence
of
disease
through
all
the
epochs
of
life
as
we
do
of
showing
the
intensity
of
mortality
yet
the
report
of
finlaison
already
referred
to
enables
us
to
show
its
comparative
prevalence
at
several
of
those
stages
thus
from
this
document
it
appears
that
among
the
industrious
poor
of
london
members
of
benefit
societies
out
of
a
million
of
males
the
proportion
constantly
sick
at
the
age
of
is
at
the
age
of
it
is
at
the
age
of
it
is
at
the
age
of
it
is
at
the
age
of
it
is
at
the

the

at
the
age
of
and
upwards
it
is
the
prevalence
of
sickness
is
not
an
exact
and
invariable
measure
of
the
intensity
of
mortality
but
there
is
a
close
connexion
between
them
as
is
manifest
from
the
progressively
increasing
amount
of
sickness
as
age
advances
thus
in
the
first
ten
years
from
the
age
of
to
that
of
there
is
no
increase
of
sickness
its
prevalence
is
all
but
identically
the
same
in
the
next
ten
years
from
the
age
of
to
that
of
the
increase
of
sickness
as
compared
with
that
of
the
preceding
decade
is
in
the
next
ten
years
from
the
age
of
to
that
of
the
increase
is
only
in
the
next
ten
years
from
the
age
of
to
that
of
the
increase
is
while
from
the
age
of
to
it
is
such
are
the
results
derived
from
the
experience
of
disease
considered
in
the
aggregate
all
its
varied
forms
taken
together
i
am
enabled
further
to
present
an
exact
and
most
instructive
proof
that
one
particular
disease
which
in
this
point
of
view
may
be
considered
as
more
important
than
any
other
because
it
is
the
grand
agent
of
death
namely
fever
carries
on
its
ravages
in
a
ratio
which
steadily
and
uniformly
increases
as
the
age
of
its
victim
advances
having
submitted
the
experience
of
the
london
fever
hospital
for
the
ten
years
preceding
january
an
observation
including
nearly
patients
affected
with
this
malady
to
finlaison
it
was
subjected
by
him
to
calculation
among
other
curious
and
instructive
results
to
be
stated
hereafter
it
was
found
that
the
mortality
of
fever
resolves
itself
into
the
following
remarkable
progression
thus
suppose
patients
to
be
attacked
with
this
disease
between
the
ages
of
and
of
these
there
would
die
and
of
an
equal
number
between
and
there
would
die
and
and
and
and
and
upwards
thus
the
risk
of
life
from
this
malady
is
twice
as
great
at
the
age
of
as
it
is
at
eleven
it
is
also
nearly
twice
as
great
at
as
it
is
at
it
is
five
times
as
great
at
as
it
is
at
eleven
and
nearly
four
times
as
great
above
as
it
is
at
from
the
whole
of
the
foregoing
statements
it
is
manifest
that
life
is
a
fluctuating
quantity
in
order
to
compare
this
fluctuating
quantity
under
different
circumstances
writers
on
this
branch
of
statistics
use
several
terms
the
exact
meaning
of
which
it
is
desirable
to
explain
it
is
for
example
very
important
to
have
a
clear
understanding
of
what
is
meant
by
such
expressions
as
the
following
the
expectation
the
probability
the
value
the
decrement
of
life
and
the
law
of
mortality
the
expectation
of
life
it
is
important
to
bear
in
mind
that
several
expressions
in
common
use
have
a
signification
perfectly
synonymous
with
this
namely
of
duration
of
vie
by
these
terms
is
expressed
the
total
number
of
years
including
also
the
fractional
parts
of
a
year
ordinarily
attained
by
human
beings
from
and
after
any
given
age
suppose
for
example
that
one
thousand
persons
enter
on
the
year
of
their
age
suppose
the
number
of
years
and
days
which
each
one
of
them
lives
afterwards
be
observed
and
recorded
suppose
the
number
ultimately
attained
by
each
be
formed
into
a
sum
total
suppose
this
total
be
divided
equally
among
the
thousand
the
quotient
of
this
division
is
said
to
be
each
share
of
existence
or
his
mean
duration
of
life
or
his
expectation
of
life
thus
of
the
thousand
persons
in
the
present
case
supposed
to
commence
the
age
of
suppose
the
number
of
years
they
collectively
attain
amount
to
years
the
part
of
is
three
and
a
half
three
years
and
a
half
then
is
said
to
be
the
expectation
of
life
at
the
age
of
because
of
all
the
persons
originally
starting
this
is
the
equal
share
of
existence
that
falls
to
the
lot
of
each
probability
of
life
or
probable
duration
of
vie
these
are
synonymous
terms
in
use
chiefly
among
continental
writers
as
an
expression
of
the
comparative
duration
of
life
the
tabular
methods
of
setting
forth
the
duration
of
life
consist
for
the
most
part
in
assuming
that
infants
are
born
and
that
at
the
age
of
one
two
three
and
each
successive
year
of
life
there
are
so
many
still
remaining
in
existence
fix
on
any
age
observe
what
number
remain
alive
to
commence
that
age
note
at
what
age
this
number
decreases
to
the
age
at
which
they
so
come
to
is
called
the
probable
term
of
life
because
say
the
continental
writers
it
is
an
equal
wager
whether
a
person
shall
or
shall
not
be
alive
at
that
period
thus
suppose
one
thousand
males
commence
together
the
age
of
suppose
the
table
indicate
that
there
will
be
alive
at
the
age
of
at
the
age
of
at
the
age
of
at
the
age
of
and
so
on
in
the
present
case
the
probable
duration
of
life
at
is
said
to
be
very
nearly
three
years
because
at
the
age
of
there
are
left
alive
very
nearly
of
the
thousand
that
originally
started
together
value
of
life
this
term
when
used
accurately
expresses
the
duration
of
life
as
measured
by
one
or
other
of
the
methods
already
expounded
but
it
is
sometimes
popularly
used
in
a
loose
and
singularly
inaccurate
sense
thus
it
is
very
commonly
such
a
man
life
is
not
worth
ten
years
purchase
which
is
the
same
thing
as
to
say
that
an
annuity
suppose
a
hundred
pounds
a
year
payable
during
the
life
of
the
person
in
question
is
not
worth
ten
times
its
magnitude
that
is
one
thousand
pounds
if
a
thousand
pounds
be
put
into
a
bank
at
some
rate
of
interest
to
be
agreed
upon
and
if
a
hundred
pounds
be
drawn
every
year
from
the
stock
the
expression
under
consideration
affirms
that
the
person
in
question
will
be
dead
before
the
principal
and
interest
are
exhausted
for
instance
at
four
per
the
value
of
an
annuity
of
one
hundred
pounds
to
a
man
of
the
age
of
is
which
is
years
purchase
whereas
his
expectation
of
life
at
that
age
is
years
law
of
mortality
by
this
term
is
expressed
the
proportion
out
of
any
determinate
number
of
human
beings
who
enter
on
a
given
year
of
age
that
will
die
in
that
year
every
observation
on
the
duration
of
life
presents
certain
numbers
which
by
recorded
facts
are
found
to
pass
through
each
year
of
age
and
also
shows
how
many
have
died
or
failed
to
pass
through
every
year
of
age
those
numbers
by
the
rule
of
three
are
converted
into
the
proportions
who
would
die
at
each
age
out
of
one
million
of
persons
if
such
a
number
had
commenced
it
suppose
then
a
million
of
persons
to
be
in
existence
at
the
first
year
of
age
suppose
a
million
to
be
in
existence
at
the
second
year
of
age
suppose
a
million
to
be
in
existence
at
the
third
year
of
age
and
in
this
manner
suppose
an
equal
number
to
be
in
existence
at
the
commencement
of
each
and
every
year
to
the
extreme
term
of
human
life
now
the
proportions
that
by
actual
observation
are
found
to
die
at
each
and
every
year
out
of
the
million
that
were
alive
at
the
commencement
of
it
form
separately
the
law
of
mortality
for
each
year
and
collectively
for
the
whole
of
life
decrement
of
life
assuming
as
before
that
a
million
of
male
children
are
born
alive
for
the
must
be
excluded
from
the
calculation
if
it
be
found
that
would
die
in
the
first
year
it
follows
that
the
difference
namely
will
enter
upon
the
age
of
one
year
suppose
the
law
of
mortality
indicate
that
the
proportion
that
will
die
out
of
a
million
between
the
age
of
one
and
two
is
it
is
plain
that
the
number
who
would
die
out
of
will
by
the
rule
of
three
be
and
consequently
that
the
residue
namely
will
remain
alive
and
so
enter
on
the
age
of
two
years
this
method
being
pursued
through
each
and
every
age
to
the
extreme
term
of
life
when
none
of
the
original
million
survive
the
result
is
a
table
of
mortality
in
the
form
in
which
it
is
commonly
presented
in
the
works
of
writers
on
this
branch
of
science
in
the
table
thus
constructed
there
is
a
column
containing
the
number
of
living
persons
who
out
of
the
original
million
lived
to
enter
upon
each
and
every
year
of
this
rank
of
numbers
the
difference
between
each
term
and
its
next
succeeding
one
is
the
number
who
die
in
that
particular
interval
that
number
is
the
measure
of
what
is
technically
called
the
decrement
of
life
for
that
particular
year
and
the
whole
of
the
decrements
for
each
and
every
year
taken
collectively
is
termed
the
decrement
of
life
the
decrement
of
life
then
is
not
only
not
the
same
as
the
law
of
mortality
but
is
carefully
to
be
distinguished
from
it
the
law
of
mortality
is
derived
from
observing
the
number
who
die
out
of
one
and
the
same
number
which
is
always
supposed
to
enter
on
each
and
every
year
the
decrement
of
life
constitutes
a
rank
of
numbers
arising
out
of
the
successive
deaths
that
is
out
of
the
original
million
in
the
first
year
out
of
the
survivors
of
that
million
in
the
second
year
out
of
the
survivors
of
those
survivors
in
the
third
year
and
so
on
in
the
first
case
the
number
of
the
living
is
always
the
same
the
number
that
die
is
the
variable
quantity
in
the
second
case
the
number
of
the
living
is
the
variable
quantity
while
the
number
that
die
may
remain
pretty
much
the
same
for
a
succession
of
years
and
on
casting
the
eye
on
the
tables
constructed
in
the
ordinary
mode
it
will
be
seen
that
the
number
often
does
remain
the
same
for
a
considerable
series
of
years
we
have
said
that
life
is
a
fluctuating
quantity
it
fluctuates
in
different
countries
at
the
same
period
in
the
same
country
at
different
periods
in
the
same
country
at
the
same
period
in
different
places
in
the
same
country
at
the
same
period
in
the
same
place
among
different
classes
in
the
same
country
at
the
same
period
in
the
same
place
among
the
same
class
at
the
different
determinate
stages
of
life
some
few
of
these
fluctuations
and
more
especially
the
last
depend
on
the
primary
constitution
of
the
organization
in
which
life
itself
has
its
seat
over
which
man
has
little
or
no
control
the
greater
part
of
them
depend
on
external
and
adventitious
agencies
over
which
man
has
complete
control
human
ignorance
apathy
and
indolence
may
render
the
duration
of
life
in
regard
to
large
classes
and
entire
countries
short
human
knowledge
energy
and
perseverance
may
extend
the
duration
of
life
far
beyond
what
is
commonly
imagined
it
will
be
interesting
and
instructive
to
select
a
few
of
the
more
striking
examples
of
this
from
the
records
we
possess
few
and
imperfect
as
they
are
in
relation
to
this
subject
of
the
duration
of
life
in
the
earlier
periods
of
the
history
of
the
human
race
we
know
nothing
with
exactness
though
there
are
incidental
statements
which
afford
the
means
of
deducing
with
some
probability
the
rate
of
mortality
in
particular
situations
there
has
come
down
to
us
one
document
through
domitius
ulpianus
a
judge
who
flourished
in
the
reign
of
alexander
severus
which
enables
us
to
form
a
probable
conjecture
at
least
of
the
opinion
of
the
roman
people
of
the
value
of
life
among
the
citizens
of
rome
in
that
age
it
happened
at
rome
as
in
other
countries
that
when
an
estate
came
into
the
possession
of
an
individual
it
was
burthened
with
a
provision
for
another
person
during
the
life
of
the
latter
a
younger
brother
for
example
this
provision
was
called
by
the
romans
an
aliment
no
estate
burthened
with
such
a
provision
could
be
sold
by
the
heir
in
possession
unless
the
purchaser
retained
in
his
hands
so
much
of
the
price
as
was
deemed
adequate
to
secure
the
regular
and
continuous
payment
of
the
aliment
this
imposed
upon
the
romans
the
necessity
of
considering
what
the
term
of
life
would
probably
be
from
and
after
any
given
age
what
they
did
conceive
that
term
to
be
is
stated
in
a
document
of
ulpianus
recorded
by
justinian
and
given
in
the
note
below
this
document
imports
that
from
infancy
up
to
the
age
of
there
should
be
allowed
years
from
to
to
to
to
from
to
to
and
at
all
ages
above
but
between
and
as
many
years
were
to
be
allowed
as
the
age
of
the
party
fell
short
of
deducting
one
year
no
clue
has
hitherto
been
obtained
to
the
discovery
of
the
real
meaning
of
this
document
it
is
however
highly
probable
that
the
romans
had
fallen
on
one
of
the
two
methods
of
measuring
the
value
of
life
already
explained
namely
that
termed
the
probability
of
life
of
the
two
modes
of
determining
the
value
of
life
the
probability
was
more
likely
to
occur
to
a
roman
judge
than
the
expectation
he
had
no
tables
no
registers
to
guide
him
what
course
then
would
he
be
likely
to
take
probably
he
would
form
a
list
of
his
own
and
others
within
his
own
knowledge
of
the
age
say
of
twenty
by
prevailing
on
persons
of
his
own
age
on
whose
correctness
he
could
rely
to
draw
out
similar
lists
he
might
accumulate
some
thousand
names
in
this
list
it
is
probable
that
the
male
sex
alone
would
be
included
on
account
of
the
greater
ease
of
ascertaining
both
their
exact
age
and
the
exact
date
of
their
death
for
the
same
reason
it
is
probable
that
the
list
would
consist
only
of
the
nobility
and
the
inhabitants
of
towns
having
thus
completed
his
list
the
next
step
would
be
to
frame
another
list
of
all
who
died
at
the
age
of
and
next
another
list
of
all
who
died
at
the
age
of
and
so
on
through
each
and
every
year
of
life
now
by
subtracting
the
number
in
the
list
no
that
is
those
who
died
between
twenty
and
from
the
number
who
originally
started
at
twenty
which
in
other
words
would
be
to
find
the
decrement
of
life
in
the
mode
already
explained
he
would
see
how
many
lived
to
commence
the
age
of
and
so
on
through
each
year
of
life
but
this
would
be
to
construct
a
table
showing
the
probable
duration
of
life
that
is
a
table
from
which
he
could
observe
at
what
advanced
age
the
number
originally
starting
at
twenty
and
so
on
came
to
diminish
to
when
it
would
naturally
occur
to
him
that
it
is
an
equal
wager
whether
such
younger
life
would
or
would
not
be
in
existence
at
the
advanced
age
so
ascertained
if
we
suppose
this
to
have
been
the
method
actually
adopted
by
the
roman
judge
and
apply
it
to
the
table
of
ulpianus
the
result
obtained
is
consistent
in
an
extraordinary
degree
and
is
highly
interesting
there
is
reason
to
believe
that
the
mortality
at
present
throughout
europe
taking
all
countries
together
including
towns
and
villages
and
combining
all
classes
into
one
aggregate
is
one
in
süssmilch
a
celebrated
german
writer
who
flourished
about
the
middle
of
the
last
century
estimated
it
at
this
average
at
that
period
the
result
of
all
finlaison
investigations
is
a
conviction
that
the
average
for
the
whole
of
europe
does
not
materially
differ
at
the
present
time
he
has
ascertained
by
an
actual
observation
that
in
the
year
it
was
precisely
this
in
the
town
of
ostend
taking
this
town
then
as
the
subject
of
comparison
it
is
found
that
the
probable
duration
of
life
among
the
male
sex
at
ostend
exceeds
the
roman
allowance
by
the
following
number
of
years
namely
at
the
age
of
the
excess
in
round
numbers
is
years
but
it
is
not
improbable
that
the
romans
made
some
deduction
from
what
they
knew
to
be
the
real
value
of
life
among
the
citizens
of
rome
on
account
of
the
use
of
the
money
appropriated
to
the
aliment
which
the
purchaser
of
the
estate
retained
in
his
own
hands
it
has
been
shown
that
the
average
mortality
at
present
at
ostend
is
one
in
which
is
the
same
thing
as
to
assert
that
a
child
at
ostend
has
an
expectation
of
and
a
half
years
of
life
the
roman
allowance
from
birth
primâ
was
thirty
years
if
we
suppose
the
romans
deducted
from
the
real
value
of
life
five
and
a
half
years
for
the
interest
of
money
it
would
bring
the
roman
allowance
and
the
duration
of
life
at
ostend
to
the
same
the
like
deduction
at
the
age
of
seventeen
would
likewise
bring
the
probability
of
life
in
both
cases
to
the
same
it
is
not
likely
that
the
romans
without
any
record
of
the
individual
facts
and
acting
only
on
a
general
principle
of
utility
the
best
they
could
find
would
make
any
variation
for
the
intermediate
years
of
childhood
and
youth
consequently
the
presumption
is
that
the
duration
of
life
at
rome
years
ago
was
very
much
the
same
as
it
is
throughout
europe
at
the
present
day
this
estimate
however
for
the
reasons
already
assigned
includes
only
the
resident
citizens
of
rome
the
male
sex
and
the
higher
classes
what
the
mortality
was
at
rome
among
the
lower
class
including
the
it
was
in
the
roman
provinces
and
in
the
less
civilized
countries
of
that
have
no
means
of
forming
even
a
conjecture
what
it
was
in
europe
during
the
succeeding
ages
of
barbarism
we
do
not
know
in
civilized
rome
the
value
of
life
had
probably
reached
a
very
high
point
in
barbarian
europe
we
may
be
sure
it
fell
to
an
exceedingly
low
point
from
that
low
point
in
civilized
europe
it
has
been
slowly
but
gradually
rising
until
in
modern
times
the
whole
mass
of
the
european
population
has
to
say
the
very
least
reached
the
highest
point
attained
by
the
select
class
in
ancient
rome
but
in
some
favoured
spots
in
europe
the
whole
mass
has
advanced
considerably
beyond
the
select
class
in
ancient
rome
in
england
for
example
the
expectation
of
life
at
the
present
day
for
the
mass
of
the
people
as
compared
with
that
of
the
mass
at
ostend
which
as
has
been
shown
is
the
same
as
that
of
the
whole
of
europe
is
as
follows
at
birth
years
at
it
should
be
borne
in
mind
that
the
females
of
the
mass
exceed
in
duration
the
lives
of
the
males
at
every
age
by
two
or
three
years
the
earliest
statistical
document
bearing
on
the
rate
of
mortality
in
any
european
nation
emerging
from
the
state
of
barbarism
appears
to
be
a
manuscript
of
the
fourteenth
century
relating
to
the
mortality
of
paris
from
which
villermé
has
calculated
that
the
mortality
of
paris
at
that
period
was
one
in
sixteen
how
the
individual
facts
contained
in
this
manuscript
were
collected
from
which
calculation
is
made
does
not
appear
and
it
makes
the
mortality
so
excessive
as
to
be
altogether
incredible
yet
a
statement
scarcely
less
extraordinary
is
made
with
regard
to
stockholm
in
the
middle
of
the
last
century
from
a
table
given
by
price
vol
it
appears
that
for
all
sweden
between
the
years
and
the
expectation
of
life
of
males
at
birth
was
females
years
years
while
at
the
same
time
it
was
at
stockholm
for
males
at
birth
females
years
years
whereas
for
the
twenty
years
preceding
it
was
for
all
sweden
at
birth
males
females
hitherto
in
all
places
which
man
has
made
his
abode
noxious
agents
have
been
present
which
act
injuriously
upon
his
body
tending
to
disturb
the
actions
of
its
economy
and
ultimately
to
extinguish
life
all
these
noxious
agents
of
whatever
name
or
quality
may
be
included
under
the
term
causes
of
mortality
inherent
in
the
constitution
of
the
body
are
conservative
powers
the
tendency
of
which
is
to
resist
the
influence
of
these
causes
of
mortality
the
actual
mortality
at
all
times
will
of
course
be
according
to
the
relative
strength
of
these
destructive
agents
and
the
relative
weakness
of
these
conservative
powers
there
are
states
of
the
system
tending
to
enfeeble
these
conservative
powers
such
states
become
tests
often
exceedingly
delicate
of
the
presence
and
power
of
the
destructive
agents
to
which
the
body
is
exposed
and
such
more
especially
are
the
states
of
parturition
infancy
and
sickness
during
the
prevalence
of
these
states
in
which
the
conservative
powers
of
the
body
are
weak
life
is
destroyed
by
causes
which
do
not
prove
mortal
in
other
conditions
of
the
system
accordingly
in
every
age
and
country
the
rate
of
mortality
among
its
women
its
infants
and
its
sick
may
be
taken
as
a
measure
of
the
degree
in
which
the
state
of
the
whole
population
is
favourable
or
unfavourable
to
life
the
change
that
has
taken
place
in
the
condition
of
women
during
the
last
century
in
all
the
nations
of
europe
can
not
be
contemplated
without
astonishment
the
mortality
of
women
in
france
at
the
hôtel
dieu
of
paris
in
is
stated
to
have
been
one
in
in
for
the
whole
kingdom
of
prussia
including
all
ranks
it
was
one
in
in
england
in
the
year
at
the
british
hospital
of
london
it
was
one
in
in
it
diminished
to
one
in
in
the
years
between
and
it
further
decreased
to
one
in
in
at
the
hospital
of
dublin
it
was
no
more
than
one
in
while
during
the
last
fifteen
years
at
lewes
a
healthy
provincial
town
out
of
cases
there
have
been
only
two
deaths
that
is
one
in
there
is
no
reason
to
suppose
that
the
mortality
in
the
state
of
parturition
is
less
at
lewes
than
in
any
other
equally
healthy
in
england
equally
striking
is
the
proof
of
the
diminished
violence
of
the
prevalent
causes
of
disease
and
death
derived
from
the
diminished
mortality
of
children
the
vital
power
of
resistance
being
always
comparatively
weak
in
the
human
infant
and
consequently
the
agents
that
prove
destructive
to
life
exerting
their
main
force
on
the
new
born
and
on
those
of
tender
age
from
mortuary
tables
preserved
with
considerable
accuracy
at
geneva
since
the
year
it
appears
that
at
the
time
of
the
reformation
of
the
children
born
died
within
the
sixth
year
in
the
seventeenth
century
not
till
within
the
twelfth
year
in
the
eighteenth
century
not
until
the
year
consequently
in
the
space
of
about
three
centuries
the
probability
that
a
child
born
in
geneva
would
arrive
at
maturity
has
increased
fivefold
in
the
present
day
at
ostend
only
half
of
the
children
attain
the
age
of
thirty
whereas
in
england
they
attain
the
age
of
no
less
remarkable
is
the
progressive
diminution
of
mortality
among
the
sick
of
all
ages
hippocrates
has
left
a
statement
which
has
come
down
to
our
times
of
the
history
and
fate
of
cases
of
acute
disease
out
of
this
number
were
cases
of
continued
fever
of
these
febrile
cases
died
above
half
of
the
whole
the
remaining
five
were
cases
of
local
inflammation
and
of
these
four
were
fatal
thus
of
the
whole
number
of
the
sick
were
lost
now
even
in
the
fever
hospital
of
london
to
which
for
the
most
part
only
the
worst
cases
that
occur
in
the
metropolis
are
sent
and
even
of
these
many
not
until
so
late
a
period
of
the
disease
that
all
hope
of
recovery
is
extinct
the
mortality
ranges
in
different
years
from
one
in
six
to
one
in
twelve
and
for
a
period
of
ten
consecutive
years
it
is
no
more
than
one
in
seven
while
in
the
dublin
fever
hospital
where
most
of
the
cases
are
sent
very
early
the
average
mortality
from
to
was
one
in
twelve
at
the
imperial
hospital
at
petersburg
the
average
mortality
for
fourteen
years
ending
in
was
one
in
four
and
a
half
in
the
charité
of
berlin
on
an
average
of
twenty
years
from
to
it
was
one
in
six
at
dresden
it
was
one
in
seven
at
munich
it
was
one
in
nine
the
lowest
of
any
hospital
of
equal
size
in
germany
in
the
year
the
average
mortality
at
bartholomew
and
thomas
hospitals
was
from
one
in
seven
to
one
in
ten
during
the
ten
years
from
to
it
decreased
to
one
in
fourteen
from
to
it
was
one
in
sixteen
the
average
for
fifty
years
from
to
was
one
in
fifteen
in
the
smaller
towns
the
mortality
is
still
less
it
is
less
in
edinburgh
and
dublin
than
in
london
while
in
the
hospital
at
bath
during
even
among
the
physician
patients
the
mortality
was
only
one
in
twenty
in
the
german
provincial
towns
the
diminution
is
still
more
remarkable
in
the
hospital
at
gottingen
for
example
it
is
only
one
in
if
the
accuracy
of
these
statements
could
be
relied
on
they
would
not
only
afford
striking
illustrations
of
the
fact
that
extraordinary
differences
prevail
in
the
rate
of
mortality
in
different
places
at
different
periods
and
under
different
circumstances
but
they
would
further
prove
that
during
the
last
century
a
steady
and
progressive
diminution
of
mortality
has
taken
place
in
all
the
countries
of
europe
but
of
the
truth
of
this
there
is
much
more
certain
evidence
than
can
be
derived
from
calculations
the
trustworthiness
of
the
data
of

is
not
established
and
the
correctness
of

fluctuations
of

increase

the
differences
that
have
taken
place
in
different
countries
at
different
periods
in
the
duration
of
life
at
a
given
age
let
us
take
the
age
given
in
the
first
column
namely
fifty
assuming
then
the
highest
degree
of
longevity
hitherto
attained
at
the
age
of
fifty
to
be
years
it
appears
that
between
the
years
and
the
mass
of
the
people
in
breslau
in
silesia
fell
short
of
reaching
this
period
by
weeks
the
inhabitants
of
the
town
of
ostend
in
flanders
between
and
by
weeks
the
nominees
of
the
tontine
of
england
between
the
years
and
by
weeks
the
inhabitants
of
the
town
of
northampton
in
england
between
and
by
weeks
the
mass
of
the
people
in
sweden
between
and
by

the
public
annuitants
of
holland
between
and
by

the

of

between

by

the
persons
assured
at
the

between
and
by

the
inhabitants
of
all
england
and
wales
between
and
by
weeks
the
english
government
annuitants
between
and
only
by
weeks
from
these
statements
it
appears
that
towards
the
close
of
the
seventeenth
century
the
duration
of
life
in
england
was
considerably
less
than
in
france
less
even
than
in
holland
nearly
a
century
earlier
thus
the
nominees
of
the
tontine
of
france
between
the
years
and
at
the
age
of
fifty
according
to
de
parcieux
fell
short
of
the
maximum
longevity
by
weeks
the
public
annuitants
of
holland
years
before
namely
between
the
years
and
according
to
kersseboom
fell
short
of
the
maximum
longevity
by
weeks
whereas
the
nominees
of
the
tontine
of
england
between
the
years
and
according
to
finlaison
fell
short
of
it
by
weeks
a
difference
nearly
double
that
of
holland
and
quite
double
that
of
france
in
persons
of
the
corresponding
rank
in
society
since
that
period
surprising
changes
have
taken
place
in
all
the
nations
of
europe
but
in
none
has
the
change
been
so
great
as
in
england
from
that
period
when
its
mortality
exceeded
that
of
any
great
and
prosperous
european
country
its
mortality
has
been
steadily
diminishing
and
at
the
present
time
the
value
of
life
is
greater
in
england
than
in
any
other
country
in
the
world
not
only
has
the
value
of
life
been
regularly
increasing
until
it
has
advanced
beyond
that
of
any
country
of
which
there
is
any
record
but
the
remarkable
fact
is
established
that
the
whole
mass
of
its
people
now
live
considerably
longer
than
its
higher
classes
did
in
the
seventeenth
and
eighteenth
centuries
thus
by
inspecting
the
preceding
table
it
will
be
seen
that
between
the
years
and
the
nominees
of
the
tontine
of
england
at
the
age
of
fifty
fell
short
of
the
maximum
longevity
by
weeks
whereas
the
mass
of
the
people
in
all
england
and
wales
between
the
years
and
fell
short
of
it
only
by
weeks
the
entire
mass
having
not
only
reached
the
select
class
but
absolutely
advanced
beyond
it
by
weeks
there
can
not
be
a
more
interesting
and
instructive
thing
than
to
connect
these
facts
with
their
causes
this
will
be
attempted
in
a
subsequent
part
of
this
work
but
the
reader
will
be
incomparably
better
prepared
for
the
investigation
when
the
processes
of
life
have
been
explained
and
the
influence
of
physical
and
moral
agents
upon
them
traced

which
the
human
body
is
composed
are
azote
oxygen
and
hydrogen
gaseous
fluids
and
carbon
phosphorus
calcium
sulphur
sodium
potassium
magnesium
and
iron
solid
substances
these
bodies
are
called
elementary
and
ultimate
because
they
are
capable
of
being
resolved
by
no
known
process
into
more
simple
substances
these
elementary
bodies
unite
with
each
other
in
different
proportions
and
thus
form
compound
substances
a
certain
proportion
of
azote
uniting
with
a
certain
proportion
of
oxygen
hydrogen
and
carbon
forms
a
compound
substance
possessing
certain
properties
another
proportion
of
azote
uniting
with
a
different
proportion
of
oxygen
hydrogen
and
carbon
forms
another
compound
substance
possessing
properties
different
from
the
former
oxygen
hydrogen
and
carbon
uniting
in
still
different
proportions
without
any
admixture
of
azote
form
a
third
compound
possessing
properties
different
from
either
of
the
preceding
the
compounds
thus
formed
by
the
primary
combinations
of
the
elementary
substances
with
each
other
are
called
proximate
principles
each
proximate
principle
constitutes
a
distinct
form
of
animal
matter
of
which
the
most
important
are
named
gelatin
albumen
fibrin
oily
or
fatty
matter
mucus
urea
pichromel
osmazome
resin
and
sugar
by
chemical
analysis
it
is
ascertained
that
all
the
proximate
principles
of
the
body
however
they
may
differ
from
each
other
in
appearance
and
in
properties
are
composed
of
the
same
ultimate
elements
gelatin
for
example
consists
in
parts
of
azote
oxygen
hydrogen
carbon
parts
the
elementary
bodies
uniting
in
the
above
proportions
form
an
animal
substance
soft
tremulous
solid
soluble
in
water
especially
when
heated
and
on
cooling
which
may
be
considered
as
its
distinctive
property
separating
from
its
solution
in
water
into
the
same
solid
substance
without
undergoing
any
change
in
its
chemical
constitution
again
albumen
consists
of
azote
oxygen
hydrogen
carbon
parts
the
elementary
bodies
uniting
in
these
different
proportions
there
results
a
second
proximate
principle
an
adhesive
fluid
transparent
destitute
of
smell
and
taste
miscible
in
water
but
when
subjected
to
a
temperature
of
about
converted
into
a
solid
substance
no
longer
capable
of
being
dissolved
in
water
this
conversion
of
albumen
from
a
fluid
which
is
its
natural
state
into
a
solid
by
the
application
of
heat
is
called
coagulation
it
is
a
process
familiar
to
every
one
the
white
of
egg
is
nearly
pure
albumen
naturally
a
glary
and
adhesive
fluid
by
boiling
it
is
coagulated
into
a
white
and
firm
solid
in
like
manner
fibrin
consists
of
azote
oxygen
hydrogen
carbon
parts
forming
a
solid
substance
of
a
pale
whitish
colour
and
firm
consistence
the
peculiar
character
of
which
is
its
disposition
to
arrange
itself
into
minute
threads
or
fibres
on
the
other
hand
fat
or
oil
which
is
a
fluid
substance
of
a
whitish
yellow
colour
inodorous
nearly
insipid
unctuous
insoluble
in
water
and
burning
with
rapidity
consists
of
a
larger
proportion
of
hydrogen
a
small
proportion
of
oxygen
and
a
still
smaller
proportion
of
carbon
without
any
admixture
of
azote
from
this
account
of
the
composition
of
the
proximate
principles
which
it
is
not
necessary
to
extend
further
it
is
manifest
that
all
of
them
consist
of
the
same
ultimate
elements
and
that
they
derive
their
different
properties
from
the
different
proportions
in
which
their
elements
are
combined
the
ultimate
elements
that
compose
the
body
are
never
found
in
a
separate
or
gaseous
state
but
always
in
combination
in
the
form
of
one
or
other
of
the
proximate
principles
in
like
manner
the
proximate
principles
never
exist
in
a
distinct
and
pure
state
but
each
is
combined
with
one
or
more
of
the
others
no
part
consists
wholly
of
pure
albumen
gelatin
or
mucus
but
albumen
is
mixed
with
gelatin
or
both
with
mucus
simple
or
combined
every
proximate
principle
assumes
the
form
either
of
a
fluid
or
of
a
solid
and
hence
the
most
general
and
obvious
division
of
the
body
is
into
fluids
and
solids
but
the
terms
fluid
and
solid
are
relative
not
positive
they
merely
express
the
fact
that
some
of
the
substances
in
the
body
are
soft
and
liquid
compared
with
others
which
are
fixed
and
hard
for
there
is
no
fluid
however
thin
which
does
not
hold
in
solution
some
solid
matter
and
no
solid
however
dense
which
does
not
contain
some
fluid
fluids
and
solids
are
essentially
the
same
in
nature
they
differ
merely
in
their
mode
of
aggregation
hence
the
easy
and
rapid
transition
from
the
one
to
the
other
which
incessantly
takes
place
in
the
living
body
in
which
no
fluid
long
remains
a
fluid
and
no
solid
a
solid
but
the
fluid
is
constantly
passing
into
the
solid
and
the
solid
into
the
fluid
the
relative
proportion
of
the
fluids
in
the
human
body
is
always
much
greater
than
that
of
the
solids
hence
its
soft
consistence
and
rounded
form
the
excess
according
to
the
lowest
estimate
is
as
to
and
according
to
the
highest
as
to
but
the
proportion
is
never
constant
it
varies
according
to
age
and
to
the
state
of
the
health
the
younger
the
age
the
greater
the
preponderance
of
the
fluids
the
human
embryo
when
first
perceptible
is
almost
wholly
fluid
solid
substances
are
gradually
but
slowly
superadded
and
even
after
birth
the
preponderance
is
strictly
according
to
age
for
in
the
infant
the
fluids
abound
more
than
in
the
child
in
the
child
more
than
in
the
youth
in
the
youth
more
than
in
the
adolescent
in
the
adolescent
more
than
in
the
adult
and
in
the
adult
more
than
in
the
aged
thus
among
the
changes
that
take
place
in
the
physical
constitution
of
the
body
in
the
progress
of
life
one
of
the
most
remarkable
is
the
successive
increase
in
the
proportion
of
its
solid
matter
hence
the
softness
and
roundness
of
the
body
in
youth
its
hard
unequal
and
angular
surface
in
advanced
life
its
progressively
increasing
fixedness
and
immobility
in
old
age
and
ultimate
inevitable
death
the
fluids
are
not
only
more
abundant
than
the
solids
but
they
are
also
more
important
as
they
afford
the
immediate
material
of
the
organization
of
the
body
the
media
by
which
both
its
composition
and
its
decomposition
are
effected
they
bear
nourishment
to
every
part
and
by
them
are
carried
out
of
the
system
its
noxious
and
useless
matter
in
the
brain
they
lay
down
the
soft
and
delicate
cerebral
substance
in
the
bone
the
hard
and
compact
osseous
matter
and
the
particles
of
both
are
removed
by
their
instrumentality
every
part
of
the
body
is
a
laboratory
in
which
complicated
and
transforming
changes
go
on
every
instant
the
fluids
are
the
materials
on
which
these
changes
are
wrought
chemistry
is
the
agent
by
which
they
are
effected
and
life
is
the
governing
power
under
whose
control
they
take
place
the
fluids
composed
principally
of
water
holding
solid
matter
in
solution
or
in
a
state
of
mechanical
division
either
contribute
to
the
formation
of
the
blood
or
constitute
the
blood
or
are
derived
from
the
blood
and
after
having
served
some
special
office
in
a
particular
part
of
the
system
are
returned
to
the
blood
and
according
to
the
nature
and
proportion
of
the
substances
they
contain
are
either
aqueous
albuminous
mucous
gelatinous
fibrinous
oleaginous
resinous
or
saline
when
the
analysis
of
the
different
kinds
of
animal
matter
that
enter
into
the
composition
of
the
body
has
been
carried
to
its
ultimate
point
it
appears
to
be
resolvable
into
two
primitive
forms
first
a
substance
capable
of
coagulation
but
possessing
no
determinate
figure
and
secondly
a
substance
having
a
determinate
figure
and
consisting
of
rounded
particles
the
coagulable
substance
is
capable
of
existing
by
itself
the
rounded
particles
are
never
found
alone
but
are
invariably
combined
with
coagulated
or
coagulable
matter
alone
or
combined
with
the
rounded
particles
the
coagulable
matter
forms
when
liquid
the
fluids
when
coagulated
the
solids
when
solid
the
coagulable
substance
is
disposed
in
one
of
two
forms
either
in
that
of
minute
threads
or
fibres
or
in
that
of
minute
plates
or
laminæ
hence
every
solid
of
the
body
is
said
to
be
either
fibrous
or
laminated
the
fibres
or
laminæ
are
variously
interwoven
and
interlaced
so
as
to
form
a
or
mesh
and
the
interspaces
between
the
fibres
or
laminæ
are
commonly
denominated
areolæ
or
cells
fig
xvii
this
concrete
substance
fibrous
or
laminated
is
variously
modified
either
alone
or
in
combination
with
the
rounded
particles
these
different
modifications
and
combinations
constitute
different
kinds
of
organic
substance
when
so
distinct
as
obviously
to
possess
a
peculiar
structure
and
peculiar
properties
each
of
these
modifications
is
considered
as
a
separate
form
of
organized
matter
and
is
called
a
primary
tissue
anatomists
and
physiologists
have
been
at
great
pains
to
discriminate
and
classify
these
primary
tissues
for
it
is
found
that
when
employed
in
the
composition
of
the
body
each
preserves
its
peculiar
structure
and
properties
wherever
placed
however
combined
and
to
whatever
purpose
applied
undergoing
only
such
modification
as
its
local
connexions
and
specific
uses
render
indispensable
considering
every
substance
employed
in
the
construction
of
the
body
not
very
obviously
alike
as
a
distinct
form
of
organized
matter
these
primary
tissues
may
be
said
to
consist
of
five
namely
the
membranous
the
cartilaginous
the
osseous
the
muscular
and
the
nervous
the
first
primary
tissue
is
the
peculiar
substance
termed
membrane
it
has
been
already
stated
that
one
of
the
ultimate
forms
of
animal
matter
is
a
coagulable
substance
becoming
concrete
or
solid
under
the
process
of
coagulation
the
commencement
of
organization
seems
to
be
the
arrangement
of
this
concrete
matter
into
straight
thready
lines
at
first
so
small
as
to
be
imperceptible
to
the
naked
eye
vast
numbers
of
these
threads
successively
uniting
at
length
form
a
single
thread
of
sufficient
magnitude
to
be
visible
but
still
smaller
than
the
finest
thread
of
the
silkworm
if
the
length
of
these
threads
be
greater
than
their
breadth
they
are
called
fibres
if
on
the
contrary
their
breadth
exceed
their
length
they
are
termed
plates
or
laminæ
by
the
approximation
of
these
fibres
or
plates
in
every
possible
direction
and
by
their
accumulation
combination
and
condensation
is
constituted
the
simplest
form
of
organized
substance
the
primary
tissue
called
membrane
membrane
once
formed
is
extensively
employed
in
the
composition
of
the
body
it
is
indeed
the
material
principally
used
in
producing
covering
containing
protecting
and
fixing
every
other
component
part
of
it
it
forms
the
main
bulk
of
the
cartilaginous
tissue
it
receives
into
its
cells
the
earthy
matter
on
which
depend
the
strength
and
hardness
of
the
osseous
tissue
it
composes
the
canals
or
sheaths
in
which
are
deposited
the
delicate
substance
of
the
muscular
and
the
still
more
tender
pulp
of
the
nervous
tissue
it
gives
an
external
covering
to
the
entire
body
it
lines
all
its
internal
surfaces
it
envelopes
all
internal
organs
it
enters
largely
as
a
component
element
into
the
substance
of
every
organ
of
every
kind
it
almost
wholly
constitutes
all
the
internal
pouches
and
sacs
such
as
the
stomach
the
intestines
the
bladder
and
all
tubes
and
vessels
such
as
arteries
veins
and
lymphatics
it
furnishes
the
common
substance
in
which
all
the
parts
of
the
body
are
as
it
were
packed
it
fills
up
the
interstices
between
them
it
fixes
them
in
their
several
situations
it
connects
them
all
together
in
a
word
it
forms
the
basis
upon
which
the
other
parts
are
superinduced
or
rather
the
mould
into
which
their
particles
are
deposited
so
that
were
it
possible
to
remove
every
other
kind
of
matter
and
to
leave
this
primary
tissue
unaltered
in
figure
and
undiminished
in
bulk
the
general
form
and
outline
of
the
body
as
well
as
the
form
and
outline
of
all
its
individual
parts
would
remain
unchanged
the
properties
which
belong
to
membrane
are
cohesion
flexibility
extensibility
and
elasticity
by
its
property
of
cohesion
the
several
parts
of
the
body
are
held
together
by
its
combined
properties
of
cohesion
flexibility
and
extensibility
the
body
in
general
is
rendered
strong
light
and
yielding
while
particular
parts
of
it
are
made
capable
of
free
motion
but
elasticity
that
property
by
which
parts
removed
from
their
situation
in
the
necessary
actions
of
life
are
restored
to
their
natural
position
may
be
regarded
as
its
specific
property
the
varied
purposes
accomplished
in
the
economy
by
the
property
of
elasticity
will
be
apparent
as
we
advance
in
our
subject
meantime
it
will
suffice
to
observe
that
it
is
indispensable
to
the
action
of
the
artery
in
the
function
of
the
circulation
to
the
action
of
the
thorax
in
the
function
of
respiration
to
the
action
of
the
joints
in
the
function
of
locomotion
in
a
word
to
the
working
of
the
entire
mechanism
by
which
motion
of
every
kind
and
degree
is
effected
all
these
properties
are
physical
not
vital
vital
properties
do
belong
even
to
this
primary
form
of
animal
matter
but
they
are
comparatively
obscure
in
the
tissue
with
which
organization
commences
and
which
is
the
least
removed
from
an
inorganic
substance
the
properties
that
are
prominent
and
essential
are
merely
physical
by
chemical
analysis
membrane
is
found
to
contain
but
a
small
proportion
of
azote
the
peculiar
element
of
animal
matter
its
proximate
principles
are
gelatin
albumen
and
mucus
in
infancy
and
youth
gelatin
is
the
most
abundant
ingredient
at
a
more
advanced
period
albumen
predominates
gelatin
differs
from
albumen
in
containing
a
less
proportion
of
azote
and
a
greater
proportion
of
oxygen
on
both
accounts
it
must
be
regarded
as
less
animalized
thus
animalization
bears
a
certain
relation
to
organization
the
simplest
animal
tissue
is
the
least
animalized
and
the
least
of
all
at
the
earliest
period
of
life
not
only
are
the
physical
and
mental
powers
less
developed
in
the
young
than
in
the
adult
but
the
very
chemical
composition
of
the
primary
tissue
of
which
the
body
is
constructed
is
less
characteristic
of
the
perfect
animal
membrane
exists
under
several
distinct
forms
a
knowledge
of
the
peculiarities
of
which
will
materially
assist
us
in
understanding
the
composition
of
the
body
the
simplest
form
of
membrane
and
that
which
is
conceived
to
constitute
the
original
structure
from
which
all
the
others
art
produced
is
termed
the
when
in
thin
slices
appears
as
a
and
colourless
substance
when
examined
in
thicker
masses
it
is
of
a
whitish
or
greyish
colour
it
consists
of
minute
threads
which
cross
each
other
in
every
possible
direction
leaving
spaces
between
them
and
thus
forming
a
mesh
or
fig
xvii
not
unlike
the
spider
web
the
term
cells
given
to
these
interspaces
is
employed
rather
in
a
figurative
sense
than
as
the
expression
of
the
fact
for
there
are
no
such
distinct
partitions
as
the
term
cell
implies
the
best
conception
that
can
be
formed
of
the
arrangement
of
the
component
parts
of
this
structure
is
to
suppose
a
substance
consisting
of
an
infinite
number
of
slender
thready
lines
crossing
each
other
in
every
possible
direction
fig
the
interspaces
between
these
lines
during
life
and
in
the
state
of
health
are
filled
with
a
thin
exhalation
of
an
aqueous
nature
a
vapour
rather
than
a
fluid
rendering
and
keeping
the
tissue
always
moist
this
vapour
consists
of
the
thinner
part
of
the
blood
poured
into
these
interstitial
spaces
by
a
process
hereafter
to
be
described
termed
secretion
when
occupying
those
spaces
it
makes
no
long
abode
within
them
but
is
speedily
removed
by
the
process
of
absorption
in
health
these
two
operations
exactly
equal
each
other
but
if
any
cause
arise
to
disturb
the
equilibrium
the
vapour
accumulates
condenses
and
forms
an
aqueous
fluid
which
distends
the
cells
and
gravitates
to
the
most
depending
parts
slightly
organized
as
this
tissue
is
and
indistinct
as
its
vita
functions
may
be
it
is
obvious
that
it
must
be
the
seat
of
at
least
two
vital
functions

is
certain
that
the

this

have
no
determinate
form

they
communicate
freely
with

limited
in
its

it
may
be

conducive

be

its

is
not

the
perfection

divided
each
portion
retains
the
properties

fail

so
much
of

so
elastic
is

the
stature
lost
during

is
regained
by

repose

pressing

directions
upon

muscles

pressing
without

compresses

this
weight
being
taken
off

recumbent
posture

the

regains

of
course
the

column
its
original
length
but
the
flexibility
acquired
through
the
combined
properties

elasticity
is
exceedingly
increased
by
the
action
of
the
pulpy
and
inelastic
matter
in
the
centre
of
the
intervertebral
substance
this
matter
serving
as
a
pivot
to
the
vertebræ
facilitating
their
motion
on
each
other
its
effect
has
been
compared
to
that
of
a
bladder
partly
filled
with
water
placed
between
two
trenchers
in
this
case
the
approximation
of
the
circumference
of
the
two
trenchers
on
one
side
would
instantly
displace
a
portion
of
the
water
on
that
side
which
would
occupy
the
increasing
space
on
the
other
with
the
effect
of
facilitating
the
change
in
every
possible
direction
of
the
position
of
the
two
trenchers
in
relation
to
each
other
to
this
effect
however
it
is
indispensable
that
the
matter
immediately
around
this
central
pivot
should
be
not
like
itself
rigid
and
unyielding
but
compressible
and
elastic
it
is
an
interesting
fact
that
since
this
illustration
was
suggested
it
has
been
discovered
that
this
very
arrangement
is
actually
adopted
in
the
animal
body
in
certain
animals
in
the
very
centre
of
their
intervertebral
substance
there
has
been
actually
found
a
bag
of
water
with
a
substance
immediately
surrounding
the
bag
so
exceedingly
elastic
that
when
the
bag
is
cut
the
fluid
contained
in
it
is
projected
to
the
height
of
several
feet
in
a
perpendicular
stream
but
besides
securing
freedom
and
extent
of
motion
the
intervertebral
substance
serves
still
another
purpose
which
well
deserves
attention
firmness
and
strength
are
indispensable
to
the
fundamental
offices
performed
by
the
column
and
to
endow
it
with
these
properties
we
have
seen
that
the
external
concentric
layers
of
the
intervertebral
substance
are
exceedingly
tough
and
that
they
are
attached
to
the
bodies
of
the
vertebræ
which
are
composed
of
dense
and
compact
bone
but
than
dense
and
compact
bone
nothing
can
be
conceived
better
calculated
to
receive
and
transmit
a
shock
or
jar
on
the
application
of
any
degree
of
force
to
the
column
yet
such
force
must
necessarily
be
applied
to
it
in
every
direction
from
many
points
of
the

a
special

is
made
against

in

the
interposition
between

this
is
sufficient
to
prevent
mischief
in
ordinary
cases
a
great
degree
of
violence
applied
directly
to
the
head
is
not
common
when
it
occurs
it
is
accidental
thousands
of
people
pass
through
life
without
ever
having
suffered
from
it
on
a
single
occasion

every
hour
in

much
more
in

it
occasionally
makes
a
degree
of
force
is
applied
to
the
spinal
column

through
it
transmitted
to
the
head
such
as
did
it
produce
a
proportionate
shock
would
inevitably
and
instantly
destroy
both
spinal
cord
and
brain
the
evil
is
obviated
partly
by
the
elastic
and
partly
by
the
non
elastic
properties
of
the
matter
interposed
between
the
several
layers
of
compact
bone
by
means
of
the
elastic
property
of
this

the
head
rides
upon
the
summit
of
the
column
as
upon
a
pliant
spring
while
the
canal
of
the
spinal
cord
remains
secure
and
uninvaded
by
means
of
the
soft
and
pulpy
portion
of
this
matter
the
vibrations
excited
in
the
compact
bone
are
absorbed
point
by
point
as
they
are
produced
as
many
layers
of
this
soft

pulpy

so
many
points
of
absorption
of

excited
in

so
many
barriers
against
the
possibility
of
the
transmission
of

to
the
delicate
nervous
substance
alike
admirable
is
the
mechanism
by
which
the
separate
pieces
of
the

are
joined
together

but
one
of
the
bones
were
to
slip
off

the
nature
of
an
immoveable
joint
has
been
explained
in
the
connexion
of
the
bones
of
the

while
the
main
object
is
to
secure
firmness
of
attachment
some
degree
of
motion
is
at
the

time
obtained

seq
but
the
mode
in
which
the
several
bones
of
the
extremities
are
connected
with
each
other
and
with
the
trunk
admits
of
so
great
a
degree
of
motion
that
these
articulations
are
entitled
to
the
name
of
moveable
joints
the
component
parts
of
all
moveable
joints
are
bone
cartilage
synovial
membrane
and
ligament
the
great
character
of
a
moveable
joint
is
the
approximation
of
two
or
more
bones
yet
these
bony
surfaces
are
never
in
actual
contact
but
are
invariably
separated
from
each
other
by
cartilage
the
cartilage
either
covers
the
entire
extent
of
the
articulating
surface
of
the
bones
as
in
the
where
both
the
head
of
the
humerus
and
the
cavity
of
the
scapula
that
receives
it
are
enveloped
in
this
substance
fig
lxv
or
a
portion
of
it
is
placed
between
the
articulating
surfaces
of
the
bones
as
in
the
joint
between
the
clavicle
and
sternum
fig
lxvii
which
when
so
placed
is
termed
an
interarticular
cartilage
fig
lxvii
by
its
smooth
surface
cartilage
lessens
friction
while
by
its
elasticity
it
facilitates
motion
and
prevents
concussion
slightly
organized
cartilage
is
provided
with
comparatively
few
and
nerves
had
it
been
vascular
and
sensible
like
the
skin
and
the
muscle
the
force
applied
in
the
movements
of
the
joint
would
have
stimulated
the
to
inordinate
action
and
the
sensibility
of
the
nerves
would
have
been
the
source
of
constant
pain
every
motion
of
every
joint
would
have
been
productive
of
suffering
and
have
laid
the
foundation
of
disease
the
facility
and
ease
of
motion
obtained
by
the
smoothness
elasticity
and
comparative
insensibility
of
cartilage
are
still
further
promoted
by
the
fluid
which
lubricates
it
termed
synovia
secreted
by
a
membrane
called
synovial
which
lines
the
internal
surface
of
the
joint
and
which
bears
a
close
resemblance
to
the
serous
synovia
is
a
viscid
fluid
of
the
consistence
of
albumen
it
is
to
the
joint
what
oil
is
to
the
wheel
preventing
abrasion
and
facilitating
motion
but
it
is
formed
by
the
joint
itself
at
the
moment
when
needed
and
in
the
quantity
required
the
motion
of
the
joint
stimulates
the
synovial
membrane
to
secretion
and
hence
the
greater
the
degree
of
motion
the
larger
the
quantity
of
lubricating
fluid
that
is
supplied
the
several
parts
of
the
apparatus
of
moveable
joints
are
retained
in
their
proper
position
by
ligamentous
substance
which
as
has
been
shown
and
is
oftentimes
so
strong
that
it
is
easier
to
fracture
the
bone
than
to
tear
the
ligament
and
in
every
case
the
kind
and
extent
of
motion
possessed
by
the
joint
are
dependent
mainly
on
the
form
of
the
articulatory
surfaces
of
the
bones
and
on
the
disposition
of
the
ligaments
in
the
joint
formed
by
the
clavicle
and
the
sternum
fig

an
interarticular
cartilage

the

rare

admits
of
some
degree
of

by
two
ligaments

unite
the

these
ligaments

so
powerful

loads
superimposed

such
a
manner
as
to
combine

this
is
effected
by

what

technically
called
cylindrical
that
is
a
bone
in
which
the
osseous
fibres
are

both
varieties
are
indeed
combined
more
or
less
in

compact
substance

always
external

the
spongy
internal

in
the
cylindrical
bones
the
arrangement
is
peculiar
every

cylindrical
bone
consists
of
a
body

two
extremities
fig

the
body
is
composed
principally
of
compact
substance
which
on
the
external
surface
is
so
dense
and
solid
that
scarcely
any
distinct
arrangement
is
visible

towards
the

this

diminishes
the

a
hollow

left
filled
up

an
infinite
number
of
minute
membranous
bags
which
contain
the

part

consequently
the

number

circle
produce
a
stronger
bone
than
could
have
been
constructed

been
consolidated

been
proportionally

the
hollow
space
thus
gained
in
its
centre
renders
the
bone
lighter
by
the
subtraction
of
the
weight
of
as
many
fibres
as
would
have
gone
to
fill
up
that
space
while
its
strength
is
not
only
not
diminished

this
arrangement

the

by

which
have
a
special
apparatus
of
muscles
for
the
purpose
of
preserving
steadily
their

to
the

the
weight
of
the
body
is
thus
sustained
on
a

of

from
which
it
is
in

transmitted
to
the

where
it
ultimately
rests
upon

are
so
many

to
prevent
the

from
being
transmitted

with
a

it
is
not

now
described
and
to
be
in
the

of
all

the

of
its
various

is
maintained
and
their

excited
by
the

out
of
this

is

as

and
the

the

capable

as

as
the

becomes
immovable
soon
after
the

of
this

is
withdrawn
and
in
less
than
one
minute
from
the
time
it
ceases
to
flow
in
due
quantity
and
of
proper
quality
through
the
vessels
of
the

the

is
no
longer
capable
of

nor
the

of

nor
the
brain
of
carrying
on
any
intellectual
operation
at
the
moment
and
for
some
time
after
it
has
issued
from
its
vessel
the
appearance
of
the
blood
is
that
of
a
thick
viscid
and
tenacious
fluid
yet
it
is
essentially
a
solid
composed
of
several
substances
each
possessing
its
own
distinct
and
peculiar
properties
the
relation
and
combination
of
which
can
not
be
considered
without
exciting
the
feeling
that
our
admiration
of
the
structure
of
the
animal
frame
ought
not
to
be
confined
to
the
mechanism
of
its
solid
parts
but
that
the
whole
is
admirable
from
the
common
material
of
which
it
is
composed
to
its
most
delicate
and
elaborate
instrument
the
colour
of
redness
is
universally
associated
with
the
idea
of
blood
but
redness
of
colour
is
not
essential
to
blood
there
are
many
animals
with
true
yet
without
red
blood
and
there
is
no
animal
in
which
the
blood
is
red
in
all
the
parts
of
its
body
the
blood
of
the
insect
is
transparent
that
of
the
reptile
is
of
a
yellowish
colour
that
of
the
fish
in
the
greater
part
of
its
body
is
colourless
even
the
red
blood
of
the
human
body
is
not
equally
red
in
every
part
of
it
there
being
two
distinct
systems
of
distinguished
from
each
other
by
carrying
blood
of
different
colours
in
the
state
of
health
the
specific
gravity
of
human
blood
water
being
is
from
which
standard
it
is
capable
of
varying
from
the
maximum
to
the
minimum
the
natural
temperature
of
the
human
blood
is
from
this
it
is
capable
of
varying
from
the
maximum
to
the
minimum
these
changes
being
always
the
effect
of
disease
it
is
estimated
that
the
fluids
circulating
in
the
adult
man
amount
to
about
fifty
pounds
of
these
it
is
calculated
that
consist
of
red
blood
fluid
and
homogeneous
as
the
blood
appears
while
flowing
in
its
vessel
when
a
mass
of
it
is
collected
and
allowed
to
stand
at
rest
it
soon
undergoes
a
very
remarkable
change
first
a
thin
film
is
formed
upon
its
surface
this
is
followed
by
the
conversion
of
the
whole
mass
into
a
soft
jelly
this
jelly
separates
into
two
portions
a
fluid
and
a
solid
portion
the
solid
portion
again
separates
into
two
parts
into
a
substance
of
a
colour
occupying
the
upper
surface
and
into
a
red
mass
always
found
at
the
under
surface
the
process
by
which
the
constituents
of
the
blood
are
thus
spontaneously
disunited
and
afforded
in
a
separate
form
is
denominated
coagulation
the
fluid
portion
separated
by
the
process
is
termed
the
serum
the
solid
portion
the
coagulum
or
clot
the
white
substance
forming
the
upper
part
of
the
clot
the
fibrin
and
the
red
mass
forming
the
under
part
of
it
the
red
particles
probably
the
process
of
coagulation
commences
the
moment
the
blood
leaves
its
living
vessel
in
three
minutes
and
a
half
it
is
visible
to
the
eye
in
seven
minutes
the
mass
is
formed
into
a
jelly
in
from
ten
to
twelve
minutes
the
serum
separates
from
the
clot
in
about
twenty
the
clot
is
divided
into
fibrin
and
red
particles
when
the
coagulation
is
complete
but
occasionally
the
clot
continues
to
grow
firmer
and
firmer
for
the
space
of
hours
as
soon
as
the
coagulation
commences
and
during
all
the
time
the
blood
preserves
its
heat
an
aqueous
vapour
arises
from
it
termed
the
halitus
the
halitus
consists
of
water
holding
in
solution
a
small
quantity
of
animal
and
saline
matter
which
communicate
to
it
a
fœtid
odour
of
a
strong
and
peculiar
nature
manifest
on
approaching
a
and
still
more
manifest
in
the
of
human
beings
a
field
of
battle
during
the
process
of
coagulation
as
in
every
other
in
which
a
fluid
is
converted
into
a
solid
caloric
is
evolved
during
the
process
of
coagulation
carbonic
acid
is
also
extricated
the
process
of
coagulation
affords
three
distinct
substances
the
chief
constituents
of
the
blood
namely
serum
fibrin
and
red
particles
the

matter
gives
it
its
adhesive
consistence
and
the
saline
its
peculiar
salt
taste
the
chief
animal
matter
contained
in
it
is
the
proximate
principle
termed
albumen
which
may
be
separated
from
the
water
that
holds
it

the
application
of
heat

chemical
agents

solid
substance

also
separated
from
the
watery
portion
by
the
application
of
spirits
of
wine
acids
oxymuriate
of
mercury
and
several
other
chemical
substances
the
quantity
of
albumen
contained
in
parts
of

varies
from
about
the
maximum
to
the
minimum
if
the
albumen
yielded
by
the

subjected
to

or
be
cut
into
small
pieces
there
flows
from
it
a
watery
fluid
which
is
termed
the
serosity
in
meat
dressed
for
the
table
the
serum
of
the
blood
contained
in

converted
by
the
heat
into
solid
albumen
from
which
when

the
serosity

in
the
form
of
gravy

the

the

the
most
essential
portion
of

whatever

while

fibrin

substance
of
a
yellowish

of
stringy
fibres
disposed
in

which

form
a

these

elastic
in

aspect

their
chemical

close
resemblance
to

to
muscular
fibre
deprived

and
of

matter
and
they
form
the
basis
of

according
to
le
canu
the
proportion
of

the
third
constituent

the
matter
upon

its

depends
though
as
has
been
stated
entirely
absent
in
certain
classes
of
animals
and
in
all
animals
in
some
parts
of
their
body
seems
to
be
essential
at
least
to
the
organic
organs
whenever
they
perform
their
functions
with
a
high
degree
of
perfection
thus
in
the
lowest
class
of
vertebrated
animals
the
fish
while
the
principal
part
of
its
body
receives
only
a
colourless
fluid
its
organic
organs
as
the
heart
the
gills
the
liver
are
provided
with
red
blood
the
red
matter
wherever
present
is
invariably
heavier
than
the
fibrin
and
consequently
during
the
process
of
coagulation
it
gradually
subsides
to
the
lower
surface
and
is
always
found
forming
the
bottom
of
the
clot
its
proportion
to
the
other
constituents
varies
very
remarkably
the
maximum
being
the
minimum
and
the
medium
in
parts
of
blood
all
observers
are
agreed
that
the
red
matter
of
the
blood
consists
of
minute
particles
having
a
peculiar
and
definite
structure
but
in
regard
to
the
nature
of
that
structure
there
is
considerable
diversity
of
opinion
which
is
not
wonderful
since
the
particles
in
question
are
so
minute
that
they
can
be
distinguished
only
by
the
microscope
and
since
of
all
microscopical
objects
they
are
perhaps
the
most
difficult
to
examine
because
being
soft
and
yielding
their
figure
is
apt
to
change
and
because
there
is
reason
to
suppose
that
their
substance
is
not
uniform
in
its
refractive
power
the
earlier
observers
describe
the
red
particles
as
being
of
a
globular
figure
and
accordingly
name
them
globules
they
conceive
that
each
globule
consists
of
a
central
solid
particle
enveloped
in
a
transparent
vesicle
recently
sir
everard
home
and
bauer
in
this
country
and
mm
prevost
and
dumas
on
the
continent
have
revived
this
opinion
and
describe
the
red
particle
as
consisting
of
a
central
solid
white
corpuscle
contained
in
an
external
envelop
of
a
red
colour
when
the
blood
is
observed
with
the
microscope
in
a
living
animal
flowing
in
its
vessels
only
two
substances
can
be
distinguished
namely
a
transparent
fluid
and
the
red
corpuscles
mm
prevost
and
dumas
contend
that
these
two
substances
are
the
only
component
parts
of
the
blood
when
the
blood
coagulates
they
conceive
that
the
red
envelop
separates
from
the
central
white
corpuscle
that
these
white
corpuscles
unite
together
that
the
aggregates
resulting
from
this
combination
are
disposed
in
the
form
of
filaments
which
filaments
constitute
the
fibrin
while
the
red
matter
at
the
bottom
of
the
clot
is
nothing
but
the
disintegrated
envelops
of
the
central
particle
but
this
view
is
not
the
common
one
in
general
physiologists
conceive
the
fibrin
to
be
one
constituent
and
the
red
particles
to
be
another
constituent
of
the
blood
lister
who
has
successfully
laboured
to
improve
the
microscope
and
who
together
with
his
friend
hodgkin
have
very
carefully
examined
with
their
improved
instrument
the
red
particles
contend
that
the
figure
of
these
bodies
is
not
globular
although
they
state
that
the
instant
the
particles
are
removed
from
the
living
many
things
are
capable
of
making
them
assume
a
globular
appearance
such
for
example
as
the
application
of
water
with
a
rapidity
which
in
spite
of
every
precaution
the
eye
in
vain
attempts
to
follow
the
particles
change
their
real
figure
for
a
globular
form
on
the
application
of
the
smallest
quantity
of
pure
water
while
if
the
water
contain
a
solution
of
saline
matter
little
alteration

observe
this

a

the

the

the
results
of

it
is
manifest
that
all
the
proximate
principles
of
which
the
different
tissues
are
composed
exist
in
the
blood
namely
albumen
the
proximate
principle
forming
the
basis
of

fibrin
the
proximate
principle
forming
the
basis
of

fatty

forming

and

substances
forming

and
entering
more
or
less
into
the
composition
of
every
fluid
and
solid
the
blood
which
contains
all
the
proximate
constituents
of
the
body
and
which
by
distributing
them
to
the
various
tissues
and
organs
maintains
their
integrity
and
life
is
itself
alive
the
vitality
of
the
blood
is
proved
i
by
its
undergoing
the
process
of
death
which
it
does
just
as
much
as
the
heart
or
the
brain
every
time
it
is
removed
from
the
body
while
flowing
in
its
living
vessel
the
blood
is
permanently
fluid
its
fluidity
depends
on
a
force
of
mutual
repulsion
exerted
by
its
particles
on
each
other
that
repulsive
force
is
a
vital
endowment
probably
derived
from
the
organic
nerves
so
abundantly
distributed
to
the
inner
coat
of
the
when
this
vital
influence
is
withdrawn
which
happens
on
the
removal
of
the
blood
from
its
vessel
the
mass
is
no
longer
capable
of
remaining
fluid
the
fibrin
is
converted
into
a
solid
the
red
particles
instead
of
repelling
attract
each
other
forming
the
crude
aggregate
at
the
bottom
of
the
clot
coagulation
is
thus
a
process
of
death
its
commencement
indicates
a
diminution
of
the
vital
energy
of
the
blood
during
its
progress
that
energy
is
constantly
growing
less
and
less
the
blood
is
dying
and
when
complete
the
blood
is
dead
hence
in
every
state
of
the
system
in
which
the
vital
energy
of
the
blood
is
preternaturally
increased
coagulation
is
proportionably
slow
in
every
state
in
which
its
energy
is
diminished
coagulation
is
rapid
by
copious
and
repeated
the
vital
energy
is
rapidly
exhausted
the
effect
of
on
coagulation
is
determined
by
experiments
instituted
for
the
express
purpose
of
ascertaining
it
blood
was
received
from
a
horse
at
four
periods
about
a
minute
and
a
half
intervening
between
the
filling
of
each
cup
minutes
seconds
in
cup
no
coagulation
began
in
in
like
manner
three
cups
were
filled
with
the
blood
of
a
sheep
at
the
interval
of
half
a
minute
minutes
seconds
in
cup
no
coagulation
began
in
the
same
result
was
obtained
in
blood
taken
from
a
human
subject
a
pound
and
a
half
of
blood
was
removed
from
the
arm
of
a
woman
labouring
under
fever
a
portion
of
which
received
into
a
on
the
first
effusion
remained
fluid
for
the
space
of
seven
minutes
a
similar
quantity
taken
immediately
before
tying
up
the
arm
was
coagulated
in
three
minutes
thirty
seconds
these
experiments
demonstrate
that
coagulation
is
rapid
or
slow
as
the
vital
energy
of
the
blood
is
exhausted
or
unexhausted
or
that
in
proportion
to
the
degree
of
life
possessed
by
the
blood
is
the
space
of
time
it
takes
in
dying
this
result
is
referable
to
the
principle
already
shown
to
be
characteristic
of
living
substance
the
power
of
resisting
within
a
certain
range
the
ordinary
influence
of
physical
agents
the
operation
of
this
power
is
illustrated
in
a
beautiful
manner
in
a
series
of
experiments
performed
by
hunter
on
the
egg
and
on
blood
this
physiologist
exposed
a
live
that
is
a
fresh
egg
to
the
temperature
of
the
and
the
degrees
of
fahrenheit
it
took
half
an
hour
to
freeze
it
the
egg
was
then
thawed
and
exposed
to
less
cold
namely
to
the
degree
of
fahrenheit
it
was
now
frozen
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
a
living
egg
and
one
that
had
been
killed
by
having
been
first
frozen
and
then
thawed
were
put
together
into
a
freezing
mixture
at
the
dead
was
frozen
minutes
sooner
than
the
living
egg
the
undiminished
vitality
of
the
fresh
egg
enabled
it
to
resist
the
low
temperature
for
the
space
of
minutes
the
vitality
of
the
frozen
egg
having
been
destroyed
it
yielded
at
once
to
the
influence
of
the
physical
agent
on
subjecting
blood
to
analogous
experiments
the
result
was
found
to
be
the
same
blood
immediately
taken
from
the
living
vessel
and
blood
previously
frozen
and
then
thawed
being
exposed
to
a
freezing
mixture
a
much
shorter
period
and
a
much
less
degree
of
cold
were
required
to
freeze
the
latter
than
the
former
ii
the
vitality
of
the
blood
is
proved
by
the
change
it
undergoes
in
becoming
a
constituent
part
of
an
organized
tissue
the
blood
conveys
to
the
several
tissues
the
constituents
of
which
they
are
composed
each
tissue
selects
from
the
mass
of
blood
its
own
constituents
and
converts
them
into
its
own
substance
in
which
conversion
since
the
blood
always
goes
to
the
tissue
in
a
fluid
form
the
blood
must
necessarily
pass
from
a
fluid
into
a
solid
in
the
vessels
the
vital
endowment
of
the
blood
maintains
it
permanently
fluid
in
the
structures
the
same
power
makes
it
and
keeps
it
solid
one
and
the
same
substance
in
one
and
the
same
body
in
one
part
is
always
fluid
in
another
always
solid
the
fluid
is
every
moment
passing
into
the
solid
and
the
solid
into
the
fluid
without
intermixture
and
without
interference
nothing
analogous
to
this
is
ever
witnessed
in
inorganic
matter
in
physical
mechanism
it
is
peculiar
to
the
organized
body
and
distinctive
of
the
mechanism
of
life
sometimes
in
physical
mechanism
we
can
perceive
the
mechanical
arrangements
and
distinctly
trace
them
from
beginning
to
end
in
vital
mechanism
even
when
we
can
discern
the
mechanical
arrangements
we
can
seldom
trace
them
beyond
a
step
or
two
and
never
from
beginning
to
end
but
arrangement
and
adaptation
we
know
there
must
be
in
that
which
goes
beyond
no
less
than
in
that
which
keeps
within
our
perception
and
we
ought
scarcely
to
question
the
existence
of
adjustments
because
they
elude
our
sense
when
probably
the
very
reason
why
they
do
so
is
that
their
delicacy
and
perfection
immeasurably
exceed
any
with
which
sense
has
made
us
acquainted
iii
the
vitality
of
the
blood
is
proved
by
the
process
of
organization
we
can
trace
only
a
few
steps
of
this
process
but
these
are
sufficient
to
establish
the
point
in
question
blood
effused
from
living
vessels
into
the
substance
or
upon
the
surface
of
living
organs
solidifies
without
losing
vitality
if
a
clot
of
blood
be
examined
some
time
after
it
has
thus
become
solid
it
is
found
to
abound
with
some
of
these
vessels
are
obviously
derived
from
the
surrounding
living
parts
the
minute
vessels
of
these
parts
as
can
be
distinctly
traced
elongate
and
shoot
into
the
clot
the
clot
thus
acquires
of
its
own
by
degrees
a
complete
circulation
is
established
within
it
the
of
the
clot
act
upon
the
blood
they
receive
just
as
the
vessels
of
any
other
part
act
upon
their
blood
that
is
transform
it
into
the
animal
matter
it
is
their
office
to
elaborate
in
this
manner
a
clot
of
blood
is
converted
into
a
component
part
of
the
body
and
acquires
the
power
of
exercising
its
own
peculiar
and
appropriate
functions
in
the
economy
but
while
in
this
process
some
of
the
vessels
of
the
clot
can
be
distinctly
traced
from
the
surrounding
living
parts
others
appear
to
have
no
communication
with
those
parts
at
all
events
no
such
communication
can
be
traced
these
vessels
the
origin
of
which
can
not
be
found
external
to
the
clot
are
supposed
by
some
physiologists
to
be
formed
within
it
within
the
living
egg
during
incubation
certain
motions
or
actions
are
observed
spontaneously
to
arise
which
terminate
in
the
development
of
the
chick
analogous
motions
arising
within
the
clot
terminate
it
is
conceived
in
the
development
of
according
to
this
view
a
simultaneous
action
takes
place
in
the
clot
and
in
the
living
part
with
which
it
is
in
contact
each
shooting
out
vessels
which
elongate
approximate
unite
and
thus
establish
a
direct
vital
communication
whether
this
view
of
the
process
of
organization
be
the
correct
one
or
not
does
not
affect
the
present
argument
it
is
certain
that
a
clot
of
blood
surrounded
by
living
parts
becomes
organized
it
is
certain
that
no
dead
substance
surrounded
by
living
parts
becomes
organized
it
follows
that
the
blood
possesses
life
health
and
life
depend
on
the
quantity
quality
and
distribution
of
the
blood
the
chief
source
from
which
the
blood
itself
is
derived
is
the
chyle
hence
too
much
or
too
little
food
or
too
great
or
too
little
activity
of
the
organs
that
digest
it
may
render
the
quantity
of
the
blood
preternaturally
abundant
or
deficient
or
though
there
be
neither
excess
nor
deficiency
in
the
quantity
of
nourishment
formed
parts
of
the
blood
which
ought
to
be
removed
may
be
retained
or
parts
which
ought
to
be
retained
may
be
removed
and
hence
the
actual
quantity
in
the
system
may
be
superabundant
or
insufficient
the
relative
proportion
of
every
constituent
of
the
blood
is
capable
of
varying
and
of
course
in
the
degree
in
which
the
healthy
proportion
is
deranged
the
quality
of
the
mass
must
undergo
a
corresponding
deterioration
the
watery
portion
is
sometimes
so
deficient
that
the
mass
is
obviously
thickened
while
at
other
times
the
fluid
preponderates
so
much
over
the
solid
constituents
that
the
blood
is
thin
and
watery
the
albumen
the
quantity
of
which
varies
considerably
even
in
health
in
disease
is
sometimes
twice
as
great
and
at
other
times
is
less
than
half
its
natural
proportion
in
some
cases
the
fibrin
preponderates
so
much
that
the
coagulum
formed
by
the
blood
is
exceedingly
coherent
firm
and
dense
in
other
cases
the
quantity
of
fibrin
is
so
small
that
the
coagulation
is
imperfect
forming
only
a
soft
loose
and
tender
coagulum
and
in
extreme
cases
the
blood
remains
wholly
fluid
when
the
vital
energy
of
the
system
is
great
the
red
particles
abound
when
it
is
depressed
they
are
deficient
in
the
former
state
they
are
of
a
bright
red
colour
in
the
latter
dusky
purple
or
even
black
when
the
depression
of
the
vital
energy
is
extreme
the
power
of
mutual
repulsion
exerted
by
the
particles
would
seem
to
be
so
far
destroyed
as
to
admit
of
their
adhering
to
each
other
partially
in
certain
organs
while
in
other
cases
they
seem
to
be
actually
disorganised
and
to
have
their
structures
so
broken
up
that
they
escape
from
the
current
of
the
circulation
as
if
dissolved
in
the
serum
through
the
minute
vessels
intended
only
for
the
exhalation
of
the
watery
part
of
the
blood
this
fearful
change
is
conceived
to
have
an
intimate
connexion
with
a
diminution
of
the
proportion
of
the
saline
constituents
out
of
the
body
as
has
been
shown
the
red
particles
change
their
figure
instantaneously
and
are
rapidly
dissolved
when
in
contact
with
pure
water
while
they
undergo
little
change
of
form
if
the
water
hold
saline
matter
in
solution
it
would
seem
that
one
use
of
the
saline
constituents
of
the
blood
is
to
preserve
entire
the
figure
and
constitution
of
the
red
particles
it
is
certain
that
any
change
in
the
proportion
of
the
saline
constituents
produces
a
most
powerful
effect
on
the
condition
of
the
red
particles
it
is
no
less
certain
that
changes
do
take
place
in
the
proportion
of
the
saline
constituents
in
the
state
of
health
the
taste
of
the
blood
is
distinctly
salt
depending
chiefly
on
the
quantity
of
muriate
of
soda
contained
in
it
in
certain
violent
and
malignant
diseases
such
for
example
as
the
malignant
forms
of
fever
and
more
especially
that
form
of
it
termed
pestilential
cholera
this
salt
taste
is
scarcely
if
at
all
perceptible
and
it
is
ascertained
that
in
such
cases
the
proportion
of
saline
matter
is
sensibly
diminished
the
quality
of
the
blood
may
be
also
essentially
changed
by
the
disturbance
of
the
balance
of
certain
organic
functions
digestion
absorption
circulation
respiration
are
indispensable
to
the
formation
of
the
blood
and
to
the
nourishment
of
the
tissues
absorption
nutrition
secretion
circulation
render
the
blood
impure
either
by
directly
communicating
to
it
hurtful
ingredients
or
by
allowing
noxious
matters
to
accumulate
in
it
or
by
destroying
the
relative
proportion
of
its
constituents
organs
are
specially
provided
the
main
function
of
which
is
to
separate
and
remove
from
the
blood
these
injurious
substances
organs
of
this
class
are
called
depurating
and
the
process
they
carry
on
is
denominated
that
of
depuration
the

an

is
provided
partly
for
the
purpose
of
originating
an

force
to
put
the

and
partly
for
the
purpose
of
conveying
the

when
in

to
the
different

of
the
body
the
heart
is
the
impelling
organ
the

fig

the
heart
is

one
for
the
reception
of

the
other
for

impulse
which
keeps
the

fig

the
chamber
which
receives
the
blood
is
termed
an
auricle
fig
cxiv
and
is
connected
with
a
vessel
termed
a
vein
fig
cxiv
that
which
communicates
impulse
to
the
blood
is
termed
a
ventricle
fig
cxiv
and
is
connected
with
a
vessel
termed
an
artery
fig
cxiv
the
vein
carries
blood
to
the
auricle
the
auricle
transmits
it
to
the
ventricle
the
ventricle
propels
it
into
the
artery
the
artery
carrying
it
out
from
the
ventricle
ultimately
sends
it
again
into
the
vein
the
vein
returns
it
to
the
auricle
the
auricle
to
the
ventricle
the
ventricle
to
the

and
thus
the
blood
is
constantly
moving

the
name
of
the
process
the
circulation
of

manner
the

substituted

tendinous
matter
just
indicated
most
of
the

pursue
an
oblique
course
downwards
and
the
arrangement
of

whole
is
such
that
a
general
contraction
of

must
necessarily
bring
all
the
parts
of

object

it

so
strong
that
after

it

the

essentially
the

the

the

tunic
instead
of
being
formed
of

is
composed
of
soft
and
yielding
fibres
disposed
in
a
longitudinal
direction
while
the
inner
coat
which
is
still
more
delicate
than
that

is
arranged
in
a
peculiar
manner
the
inner

of
most
veins
at
slight
intervals
is
formed
into
folds
fig

one
margin
of

adherent

while
the
other
margin

these
membranous
folds
are
termed
valves
in
all
veins
the
diameter

the
valves
are

in

in

few
instances
quadruple

even
quintuple
the
veins
like
the
arteries
are

nutrient
vessels
and

all
the

these

these
ultimate

are
called
capillary
vessels
from
their

the

its

the
veins
are
very
much
more
numerous
than
the
arteries
for
they
often
consist
of
double
sets
and
they
are
at
the

time
more
capacious
and
more
extensible
reckoning
the
whole
of
the
blood
at
of
the
weight
of
the

it
is
estimated
that
of
this
quantity

is
in
the
arterial

the
remaining
in

system
the

of

of

is
much
greater
than
that
of
the
two
trunks
in
which
they
terminate
fig
cxx
the
blood
therefore
in
returning
to
the
heart
is
always
flowing
from
a
large
into
a
smaller
space
the
divisions
and
subdivisions
of
the
artery
freely
communicate
in
all
parts
of
the
body
by
means
of
what
are
called
anastomosing
branches
and
this
communication
of
branch
with
branch
and
trunk
with
trunk
is
termed
anastomosis
the
same
intercommunication
but
with
still
greater
freedom
and
frequency
takes
place
among
the
branches
of
veins
in
both
orders
of
vessels
the
communication
is
frequent
in
proportion
to
the
minuteness
of
the
branch
and
its
distance
from
the
heart
it
is
also
more
frequent
in
proportion
as
a
part
is
exposed
to
pressure
hence
the
minute
arteries
and
veins
about
a
joint
are
distinguished
for
the
multitude
of
their
anastomosing
branches
and
above
all
it
is
frequent
in
proportion
to
the
importance
of
the
organ
hence
the
most
remarkable
anastomosis
in
the
body
is
in
the
brain
by
this
provision
care
is
taken
that
no
part
be
deprived
of

a
part
of
the

the

receives
its
blood

four
totally
independent

that
it
pursues

that
part

full

in
it
while
the
part
of
the
vessel
which
is

becomes
empty

it
has
carried
on
its

it
can
receive
no
fresh

from

on

contrary
a
ligature
is
placed
around

that
portion
of

becomes
full

at

there
will
be
little

no
loss
of
blood
while
if
it
be
punctured
below
the

the

will
continue

arrives
at
discovery

that
many

have
an
imperfect
perception
of
an
unknown
truth
before
some
one
mind
sees
it
in
its
completeness
and
fully
discloses
it
having
about
the
year
succeeded
in
completely
tracing
the
circle
in
which
the
blood
moves
and
having
at
that
time
collected
all
the
evidence
of
the
fact
with
a
rare
degree
of
philosophical
forbearance
harvey
still
spent
no
less
than
eight
years
in
the
subject
and
in
maturing
the
proof
of
every
point
before
he
ventured
to
speak
of
it
in
public
the
brief
tract
which
at
length
he
published
was
written
with
extreme
simplicity
clearness
and
perspicuity
and
has
been
justly
characterised
as
one
of
the
most
admirable
examples
of
a
series
of
arguments
deduced
from
observation
and
experiment
that
ever
appeared
on
any
subject
cotemporaries
are
seldom
grateful
to
discoverers
more
than
one
instance
is
on
record
in
which
a
man
has
injured
his
fortune
and
lost
his
happiness
through
the
elucidation
and
establishment
of
a
truth
which
has
given
him
immortality
it
may
be
that
there
are
physical
truths
yet
to
be
brought
to
light
to
say
nothing
of
new
applications
of
old
truths
which
if
they
could
be
announced
and
demonstrated
would
be
the
ruin
of
the
discoverer
it
is
certain
that
there
are
moral
truths
to
be
discovered
expounded
and
enforced
which
if
any
man
had
now
penetration
enough
to
see
them
and
courage
enough
to
express
them
would
cause
him
to
be
regarded
by
the
present
generation
with
horror
and
detestation
perhaps
during
those
eight
years
of
the
discoverer
of
the
circulation
sometimes
endeavoured
in
imagination
to
trace
the
effect
which
the
stupendous
fact
at
the
knowledge
of
which
he
had
arrived
would
have
on
the
progress
of
his
favourite
science
and
it
may
be
the
hope
and
the
expectation
occasionally
arose
that
the
inestimable
benefit
he
was
about
to
confer
on
his
fellow
men
would
secure
to
him
some
portion
of
their
esteem
and
confidence
what
must
have
been
his
disappointment
when
he
found
after
the
publication
of
his
tract
that
the
little
practice
he
had
had
as
a
physician
by
degrees
fell
off
he
was
too
speculative
too
theoretical
not
practical
such
was
the
view
taken
even
by
his
friends
his
enemies
saw
in
his
tract
nothing
but
indications
of
a
presumptuous
mind
that
dared
to
call
in
question
the
revered
authority
of
the
ancients
and
some
of
them
saw
moreover
indications
of
a
malignant
mind
that
conceived
and
defended
doctrines
which
if
not
checked
would
undermine
the
very
foundations
of
morality
and
religion
when
the
evidence
of
the
truth
became
irresistible
then
these
persons
suddenly
turned
round
and
said
that
it
was
all
known
before
and
that
the
sole
merit
of
this
vaunted
discoverer
consisted
in
having
circulated
the
circulation
the
pun
was
not
fatal
to
the
future
fame
of
this
truly
great
man
nor
even
to
the
gradual
though
slow
return
of
the
public
confidence
even
during
his
own
time
for
he
lived
to
attain
the
summit
of
reputation
it
is
then
indubitably
established
that
the
whole
blood
of
the
body
in
successive
streams
is
collected
and
concentrated
at
the
heart
the
object
of
the
accumulation
of
a
certain
mass
of
it
at
this
organ
is
to
subject
it
to
the
action
of
a
strong
muscle
and
thereby
to
determine
its
transmission
with
adequate
force
and
precision
through
the
different
sets
of
capillary
vessels
in
the
accomplishment
of
this
object
the
heart
performs
a
twofold
action
that
of
contraction
and
that
of
dilatation
the
auricles
contract
and
thereby
diminish
their
cavities
then
dilate
and
thereby
expand
them
and
the
one
action
alternates
with
the
other
there
is
the
like
alternate
contraction
and
dilatation
of
the
ventricles
the
first
action
is
termed
systole
the
second
diastole
and
both
are
performed
with
force
when
the
heart
is
laid
open
to
view
in
a
living
animal
and
its
movements
are
carefully
observed
it
is
apparent
that
the
two
auricles
contract
together
that
the
two
ventricles
contract
together
that
these
motions
alternate
with
each
other
and
that
they
proceed
in
regular
succession
the
interval
between
these
alternate
movements
is
however
exceedingly
short
and
can
scarcely
be
perceived
when
the
heart
is
acting
with
full
vigour
but
it
is
evident
when
its
action
is
somewhat
languid
when
the
ventricles
contract
the
apex
of
the
heart
is
drawn
upwards
and
at
the
same
time
raised
or
tilted
forwards
it
is
during
this
systole
of
the
ventricles
and
in
consequence
of
this
result
of
their
action
that
the
apex
of
the
heart
gives
that
impulse
against
the
walls
of
the
chest
which
is
felt
in
the
natural
state
between
the
fifth
and
sixth
ribs
and
which
just
perceptibly
precedes
the
pulse
at
the
wrist
when
the
ear
is
applied
to
the
human
chest
over
the
situation
of
the
heart
a
dull
and
somewhat
prolonged
sound
is
heard
which
precedes
and
accompanies
the
impulse
of
the
heart
against
the
chest
this
dull
sound
is
immediately
succeeded
by
a
shorter
and
sharper
sound
after
this
there
is
a
short
pause
and
then
the
dull
sound
and
impulse
are
again
renewed
the
duller
sound
and
stronger
impulse
are
ascribed
to
the
contraction
of
the
ventricles
and
the
sharper
sound
and
feebler
impulse
to
that
of
the
auricles
the
movement
of
the
heart
is
effected
by
the
contraction
of
its
muscular
fibres
those
fibres
rest
as
upon
a
firm
support
on
the
tendinous
matter
to
which
they
are
attached
from
which
they
diverge
and
towards
which
their
contraction
must
necessarily
bring
all
the
parts
of
the
heart
the
result
of
their
contraction
is
the
powerful
compression
of
all
the
chambers
of
the
heart
and
thereby
the
forcible
ejection
of
their
contents
through
the
natural
openings
but
the
chambers
alternately
with
forcible
contraction
perform
the
action
of
forcible
dilatation
this
movement
of
dilatation
is
effected
by
the
reaction
of
the
elasticity
of
the
tendinous
matter
on
which
the
muscular
fibres
are
supported
this
highly
elastic
substance
by
the
contraction
of
the
fibres
is
brought
into
a
state
of
extreme
tension
the
contraction
of
the
fibres
ceasing
that
moment
the
tense
tendon
recoils
with
a
force
exactly
proportionate
to
the
degree
of
tension
into
which
it
had
been
brought
thus
the
very
agent
that
is
employed
forcibly
to
close
the
chamber
is
made
the
main
instrument
of
securing
its
instantaneous
a
vital
energy
is
appointed
to
accomplish
what
is
indispensable
and
what
nothing
else
can
effect
the
origination
of
a
motive
power
a
physical
agent
is
conjoined
to
perform
the
easier
task
to
which
it
is
competent
and
the
two
powers
the
vital
and
the
physical
work
in
harmony
each
acting
alternately
and
each
with
undeviating
regularity
and
unfailing
energy
fulfilling
its
appropriate
office
when
the
chambers
of
the
heart
which
open
into
each
other
and
which
as
freely
communicate
with
the
great
vessels
that
enter
and
proceed
from
them
are
forcibly
closed
and
the
blood
they
contain
is
projected
from
them
how
is
one
uniform
forward
direction
given
to
the
current
why
when
the
right
ventricle
contracts
is
the
blood
not
sent
back
into
the
right
auricle
as
well
as
forward
into
the
pulmonary
artery
there
is
but
one
mode
of
preventing
such
an
event
which
is
to
place
a
between
the
two
chambers
and
there
a
is
placed
and
that
is
the
valve
as
long
as
the
blood
proceeds
onwards
in
the
direct
course
of
the
circulation
it
presses
this
membrane
close
to
the
side
of
the
heart
and
thereby
prevents
it
from
occasioning
any
impediment
to
the
current
when
on
the
contrary
the
blood
is
forced
backwards
and
attempts
to
the
auricle
being
of
course
driven
in
all
directions
some
of
it
passes
between
the
wall
of
the
ventricle
and
the
valve
the
moment
it
is
in
this
situation
it
raises
up
the
valve
carries
it
over
the
mouth
of
the
passage
and
shuts
up
the
channel
there
can
not
be
a
more
perfect
this
is
beautiful
mechanism
but
there
is
another
arrangement
which
surpasses
mere
mechanism
however
beautiful
it
has
been
shown
that
one
edge
of
the
membrane
that
forms
the
valve
is
firmly
adherent
to
the
wall
of
the
ventricle
while
the
other
edge
when
not
in
action
appears
to
lie
loosely
in
the
ventricle
fig
cxvi
were
this
edge
really
loose
the
refluent
current
would
carry
it
back
completely
into
the
auricle
and
so
counteract
its
action
as
a
valve
but
it
is
attached
to
the
tendinous
threads
proceeding
from
the
fleshy
columns
that
stand
along
the
wall
of
the
ventricle
fig
cxvi
by
these
tendinous
threads
as
by
so
many
strings
the
membrane
is
firmly
held
in
its
proper
position
fig
cxvi
and
the
refluent
current
can
not
carry
it
into
the
auricle
thus
far
the
arrangement
is
mechanical
but
each
of
these
fleshy
columns
is
a
muscle
exerting
a
proper
muscular
action
among
the
stimulants
which
excite
the
contractility
of
the
muscular
fibre
one
of
the
most
powerful
is
distension
the
refluent
current
distends
the
membrane
the
distension
of
the
membrane
stretches
the
tendinous
threads
attached
to
it
the
stretching
of
its
tendinous
threads
stretches
the
fleshy
column
by
this
distension
of
the
column
it
is
excited
to
contraction
by
the
contraction
of
the
column
its
thread
is
shortened
by
the
shortening
of
the
thread
the
valve
is
tightened
and
that
in
the
exact
degree
in
which
the
thread
is
shortened
so
the
greater
the
impetus
of
the
refluent
blood
the
greater
the
distension
of
the
membrane
and
the
greater
the
distension
of
the
membrane
the
greater
the
excitement
of
the
fleshy
column
the
greater
the
energy
with
which
it
is
stimulated
to
act
the
greater
therefore
the
security
that
the
valve
will
be
held
just
in
the
position
that
is
required
with
exactly
the
force
that
is
needed
here
then
is
a
not
only
well
constructed
as
far
as
regards
the
mechanical
arrangement
but
so
endowed
as
to
be
able
to
act
with
additional
force
whenever
additional
force
is
requisite
to
put
forth
on
every
occasion
as
the
occasion
arises
just
the
degree
of
strength
required
and
no
more
the
contraction
of
the
heart
is
the
power
that
moves
the
blood
and
this
contraction
generates
a
force
which
is
adequate
to
impel
it
through
the
circle
from
experiments
performed
by
hales
it
appears
that
if
the
artery
of
a
large
animal
such
as
the
horse
be
made
to
communicate
with
an
upright
tube
the
blood
will
ascend
in
the
tube
to
the
height
of
about
ten
feet
above
the
level
of
the
heart
and
will
afterwards
continue
there
rising
and
falling
a
few
inches
with
each
pulsation
of
the
heart
in
this
animal
then
the
heart
acts
with
a
force
capable
of
maintaining
a
column
of
ten
feet
now
a
column
of
ten
feet
indicates
a
pressure
of
about
four
pounds
and
a
half
in
a
square
inch
of
surface
suppose
the
human
heart
to
be
capable
of
supporting
a
column
of
blood
eight
feet
high
this
will
indicate
a
pressure
of
four
pounds
to
the
square
inch
but
the
left
ventricle
of
the
heart
while
it
injects
its
column
of
blood
into
the
aorta
has
to
overcome
the
inertia
of
the
quantity
of
blood
projected
of
the
mass
already
in
the
artery
and
of
the
elasticity
of
the
vessel
yielding
to
a
momentary
increase
of
pressure
it
is
probable
therefore
that
the
heart
acts
with
a
force
of
six
pounds
on
the
inch
the
left
ventricle
when
distended
has
about
ten
square
inches
of
internal
surface
consequently
the
whole
force
exerted
by
it
may
be
about
sixty
pounds
according
to
the
calculation
of
hales
it
is
and
a
half
now
it
is
proved
by
numerous
experiments
that
after
death
a
slight
impulse
with
the
syringe
certainly
much
less
than
that
which
is
acting
upon
the
blood
in
the
same
artery
during
life
is
sufficient
to
propel
a
solution
of
indigo
or
fresh
drawn
blood
from
a
large
artery
into
the
extreme
capillary
if
therefore
after
death
a
slight
force
will
fill
the
capillaries
a
force
during
life
equal
to
sixty
pounds
must
be
adequate
to
do
so
the
heart
with
a
force
equal
to
the
pressure
of
sixty
pounds
propels
into
the
artery
two
ounces
of
blood
at
every
contraction
it
contracts
four
thousand
times
in
an
hour
there
passes
through
the
heart
therefore
every
hour
eight
thousand
ounces
or
seven
hundred
pounds
of
blood
it
has
been
stated
that
the
whole
mass
of
blood
in
an
adult
is
about
pounds
on
an
average
the
entire
circulation
is
completed
in
two
minutes
and
a
half
consequently
a
quantity
of
blood
equal
to
the
whole
mass
passes
through
the
heart
from
twenty
to
times
in
an
hour
but
though
the
average
space
of
time
requisite
to
accomplish
a
complete
circulation
may
be
two
minutes
and
a
half
yet
when
a
stream
of
blood
leaves
the
heart
different
portions
of
it
must
finish
their
circle
at
very
different
periods
depending
in
part
upon
the
length
of
the
course
which
they
have
to
go
and
in
part
upon
the
degree
of
resistance
that
obstructs
their
passage
a
part
of
the
stream
it
is
obvious
finishes
its
course
in
circulating
through
the
heart
itself
another
portion
takes
a
longer
circuit
through
the
chest
another
extends
the
circle
round
the
head
and
another
visits
the
part
placed
at
the
remotest
distance
from
the
central
moving
power
such
is
the
velocity
with
which
the
current
sometimes
goes
that
in
the
horse
a
fluid
injected
into
the
great
vein
of
the
neck
on
one
side
has
been
detected
in
the
vein
on
the
opposite
side
and
even
in
the
vein
of
the
foot
within
half
a
minute
it
has
been
shown
that
the
different
chambers
of
the
heart
have
a
tendency
to
perform
their
movements
in
a
uniform
manner
and
in
a
successive
order
that
they
contract
and
dilate
in
regular
alternation
and
at
equal
intervals
but
moreover
they
continue
these
movements
equally
without
rest
and
without
fatigue
on
go
the
motions
night
and
day
for
eighty
years
together
at
the
rate
of
a
hundred
thousand
strokes
every
hours
alike
without
disorder
cessation
or
weariness
the
muscles
of
the
arm
tire
after
an
hour
exertion
are
exhausted
after
a
day
labour
and
can
by
no
effort
be
made
to
work
beyond
a
certain
period
there
is
no
appreciable
difference
between
the
muscular
substance
of
the
heart
and
that
of
the
arm
it
is
true
that
the
heart
is
placed
under
one
condition
which
is
peculiar
muscles
contract
on
the
application
of
stimuli
and
different
muscles
are
obedient
to
different
stimuli
voluntary
muscles
to
the
stimulus
of
volition
and
the
heart
to
that
of
the
blood
the
exertion
of
volition
is
not
constant
but
occasional
the
muscle
acts
only
when
it
is
excited
by
the
application
of
its
stimulus
hence
the
voluntary
muscle
has
considerable
intervals
of
rest
the
blood
on
the
contrary
is
conveyed
to
the
heart
without
ceasing
in
a
determinate
manner
in
a
successive
order
and
this
is
the
reason
why
through
life
its
action
is
uniform
it
uniformly
receives
a
due
supply
of
its
appropriate
stimulus
but
why
it
is
unwearied
why
it
never
requires
rest
we
do
not
know
we
know
the
necessities
of
the
system
which
render
it
indispensable
that
it
should
be
capable
of
untiring
action
for
we
know
that
the
first
hour
of
its
repose
would
be
the
last
of
life
but
of
the
mode
in
which
this
wonderful
endowment
is
communicated
or
of
the
relations
upon
which
it
is
dependent
we
are
wholly
ignorant
the
force
exerted
by
the
heart
is
vital
it
is
distinguished
from
mechanical
force
in
being
produced
by
the
very
engine
that
exerts
it
in
the
machinery
there
is
no
real
generation
of
power
there
is
merely
concentration
and
direction
of
it
in
the
recoil
of
the
spring
in
the
reaction
of
condensed
steam
the
energy
of
the
expansive
impulse
is
never
greater
than
the
force
employed
to
compress
or
condense
and
the
moment
this
power
is
expended
all
capacity
of
motion
is
at
an
end
but
the
heart
produces
a
force
equal
to
the
pressure
of
sixty
pounds
by
the
gentlest
application
of
a
bland
fluid
here
no
force
is
communicated
to
be
again
given
out
as
in
every
mechanical
moving
power
but
it
is
new
power
power
really
and
properly
generated
and
this
power
is
the
result
of
vital
action
and
is
never
in
any
case
the
result
of
action
that
is
not
vital
the
heart
projects
the
blood
with
a
given
force
into
the
arterial
tubes
the
arteries
in
the
living
body
are
always
filled
to
distension
and
somewhat
beyond
it
by
the
quantity
of
blood
that
is
in
them
it
has
been
shown
that
the
elasticity
of
their
coats
is
such
as
to
give
to
them
even
after
death
the
form
of
open
hollow
cylinders
during
life
they
are
kept
in
a
state
of
distension
by
the
quantity
of
blood
they
contain
by
virtue
of
their
elasticity
they
react
upon
their
contents
with
a
force
exactly
proportioned
to
the
degree
of
their
distension
that
is
with
a
force
at
least
adequate
to
keep
them
always
open
and
rigid
these
open
and
rigid
tubes
already
filled
to
distension
and
somewhat
beyond
it
receive
at
every
contraction
of
the
heart
a
forcible
injection
of
a
new
wave
of
blood
the
first
effect
of
the
injection
of
this
new
wave
into
a
tube
previously
full
to
distension
is
to
cause
the
current
to
proceed
by
jerks
or
jets
each
jerk
or
jet
corresponding
to
the
contraction
of
the
heart
and
accordingly
by
this
motion
the
flow
of
the
blood
in
the
artery
is
distinguished
from
that
in
the
vein
in
which
latter
vessel
the
current
is
an
equal
and
tranquil
stream
the
second
effect
of
this
new
wave
is
to
occasion
some
further
distension
of
the
already
distended
artery
and
accordingly
when
the
vessel
is
exposed
in
a
living
animal
and
its
action
carefully
observed
a
slight
augmentation
of
its
diameter
is
distinguishable
at
every
contraction
of
the
heart
this
new
wave
while
it
distends
must
at
the
same
time
slightly
elongate
the
vessel
cause
its
straight
portions
to
bend
a
little
and
its
curved
portions
to
bend
still
more
and
consequently
in
some
situations
to
lift
it
a
little
from
its
place
giving
it
a
slight
degree
of
locomotion
these
two
causes
combined
produce
the
pulse
when
the
finger
is
pressed
gently
on
an
artery
at
the
instant
of
the
contraction
of
the
heart
the
vessel
is
felt
to
bound
against
the
finger
with
a
certain
degree
of
force
this
as
just
stated
is
owing
to
a
slight
distension
of
the
vessel
by
the
new
wave
of
blood
together
with
a
slight
elongation
of
it
and
a
gentle
rising
from
its
situation
the
blood
in
flowing
through
the
arterial
trunks
and
branches
to
the
capillaries
through
the
arterial
to
the
venous
capillaries
and
through
the
venous
branches
and
trunks
back
to
the
heart
is
exposed
to
numerous
and
powerful
causes
of
retardation
such
for
example
as
the
friction
between
the
blood
and
the
sides
of
the
vessels
the
numerous
curves
and
angles
formed
by
the
branches
in
springing
from
the
trunks
the
tortuous
course
of
the
vessels
in
many
parts
of
the
body
and
the
increasing
area
of
the
arterial
branches
as
they
multiply
and
subdivide
yet
the
extraordinary
fact
has
been
recently
discovered
that
the
blood
moves
with
the
same
momentum
or
force
in
every
part
of
the
arterial
system
in
the
aorta
in
the
artery
in
the
neck
which
carries
the
blood
to
the
head
the
carotid
artery
in
the
artery
of
the
arm
the
humeral
artery
in
the
artery
of
the
lower
extremity
the
femoral
artery
in
a
word
in
the
minute
and
remote
capillary
and
in
the
large
trunk
near
the
heart
having
contrived
an
instrument
by
which
the
force
of
the
blood
as
it
flows
in
its
vessel
could
be
accurately
indicated
by
the
rise
of
mercury
in
a
tube
poiseuille
found
that
the
elevation
of
the
mercury
is
uniformly
the
same
in
the
different
arteries
of
the
same
animal
whatever
the
size
of
the
artery
and
its
distance
from
the
heart
this
tube
was
inserted
for
example
into
the
common
carotid
artery
of
a
horse
the
diameter
of
the
vessel
was
of
an
inch
its
distance
from
the
heart
was
inches
the
height
to
which
the
mercury
rose
in
the
graduated
tube
was
accurately
marked
the
tube
was
then
inserted
into
a
muscular
branch
of
the
artery
in
the
thigh
the
diameter
of
this
vessel
was
of
an
inch
and
its
distance
from
the
heart
inches
according
to
the
mean
of
nine
observations
the
mercury
rose
in
both

here
is
another
instance
of
the
beautiful
adjustments
everywhere
established
in
the
living
economy
the
blood
is
sent
by
a
living
engine
moving
under
laws
peculiar
to
the
state
of
life
into
living
vessels
which
in
their
turn
acting
under
laws
peculiar
to
the
state
of
life
so
accommodate
themselves
to
the
current
as
absolutely
to
offer
no
resistance
to
its
progress
so
accommodate
themselves
to
the
moving
power
as
completely
and
everywhere
to
obviate
the
physical
impediments
to
motion
inseparable
from
inorganic
matter
that
the
arterial
tubes
do
possess
and
exert
a
truly
vital
power
modifying
the
current
of
the
blood
they
contain
is
indubitably
established
if
in
a
living
animal
the
trunk
of
an
artery
be
laid
bare
the
mere
exposure
of
it
to
the
atmospheric
air
causes
it
to
contract
to
such
a
degree
that
its
size
becomes
obviously
and
strikingly
diminished
this
can
result
only
from
the
exertion
of
a
vital
property
for
no
dead
tube
is
capable
in
such
a
manner
of
diminishing
its
diameter
if
during
life
an
artery
be
opened
and
the
animal
be
largely
bled
the
arteries
become
progressively
smaller
and
smaller
as
the
quantity
of
blood
in
the
body
diminishes
if
the
bleeding
be
continued
until
the
animal
dies
and
the
arteries
of
the
system
be
immediately
examined
they
are
found
to
be
reduced
to
a
very
small
size
if
again
examined
some
time
after
death
they
are
found
to
have
become
larger
and
they
go
on
growing
successively
larger
and
larger
until
they
regain
nearly
their
original
magnitude
which
they
retain
until
they
are
decomposed
by

poiseuille
distended
with
water
the
artery
of
an
animal
just
killed
this
water
was
urged
by
the
pressure
of
a
given
column
of
mercury
the
force
of
the
reaction
of
the
artery
was
now
measured
by
the
height
of
a
column
of
mercury
which
the
water
expelled
from
the
artery
could
support
it
was
found
that
the
artery
reacted
with
a
force
greater
than
that
employed
to
distend
it
and
greater
than
the
same
artery
could
exert
some
time
after
death
but
since
mechanical
reaction
can
never
be
greater
than
the
force
previously
exerted
upon
it
it
follows
that
the
excess
of
the
reaction
indicated
in
this
case
was
vital
if
an
artery
be
exposed
and
a
mechanical
or
chemical
stimulus
be
applied
to
it
its
diameter
is
altered
sometimes
becoming
larger
and
sometimes
smaller
according
to
the
kind
of
agent
employed
any
one
of
these
facts
taken
by
itself
affords
a
demonstration
that
the
arterial
trunks
and
branches
are
capable
of
enlarging
and
diminishing
their
diameter
by
virtue
of
a
vital
endowment
there
is
complete
evidence
that
the
exertion
of
this
vital
power
on
the
part
of
the
arterial
trunk
is
not
to
communicate
to
the
blood
the
smallest
impulsive
force
the
engine
constructed
for
the
express
purpose
of
working
the
current
generates
all
the
force
that
is
required
but
the
labour
of
the
engine
is
economized
by
imparting
to
the
tubes
that
receive
the
stream
a
vital
property
by
which
they
wholly
remove
the
physical
obstructions
to
its
motion
driven
by
the
heart
through
the
arterial
branches
into
the
capillaries
the
blood
courses
along
these
minute
vessels
urged
by
the
same
power
the
most
careful
observers
from
haller
and
spalanzani
down
to
the
present
time
concur
in
stating
that
the
pulsatory
movement
communicated
by
the
heart
to
the
blood
in
the
great
arteries
is
distinctly
visible
under
the
microscope
in
the
capillaries
i
have
often
observed
in
frogs
and
tadpoles
and
once
in
the
bat
says
wedemeyer
that
when
the
circulation
was
becoming
feeble
the
blood
in
the
finest
capillaries
advanced
by
jerks
corresponding
with
the
contractions
of
the
heart
i
remarked
the
same
appearance
in
the
fine
veins
several
times
in
the
toad
and
tadpole
and
once
in
the
frog
if
an
experimenter
so
dispose
the
circulation
of
the
limb
of
an
animal
that
the
flow
of
blood
be
confined
to
the
branches
of
a
single
artery
and
a
corresponding
vein
it
is
found
that
the
blood
stagnates
in
the
vein
whenever
the
current
in
the
artery
is
stopped
by
a
ligature
but
no
sooner
is
the
ligature
removed
from
the
artery
than
the
blood
begins
again
to
flow
freely
along
the
vein
the
capillaries
of
the
artery
which
have
to
send
on
the
current
to
those
of
the
vein
being
now
again
within
the
influence
of
the
heart
and
if
the
impulse
of
the
heart
be
removed
from
the
capillary
system
by
placing
a
ligature
around
the
aorta
the
capillary
circulation
is
uniformly
and
completely
stopped
it
was
found
by
hales
that
under
ordinary
circumstances
the
blood
rises
in
a
tube
connected
with
a
vein
to
the
height
only
of
six
inches
while
it
has
been
shown
that
in
the
artery
it
ascends
as
high
as
ten
feet
this
prodigious
difference
between
the
venous
and
the
arterial
tension
led
to
the
conclusion
that
the
impulsive
force
of
the
heart
was
all
but
exhausted
before
the
blood
reached
the
veins
and
set
physiologists
on
the
search
for
other
powers
to
carry
on
the
venous
circulation
it
was
overlooked
that
the
blood
has
an
open
and
ready
escape
from
the
great
trunks
of
the
veins
through
the
right
chambers
of
the
heart
and
that
in
consequence
of
this
free
escape
of
their
fluid
these
vessels
indicate
no
greater
tension
than
is
just
sufficient
to
lift
the
blood
to
the
heart
and
to
overcome
friction
magendie
having
laid
bare
the
chief
artery
and
vein
of
a
living
limb
and
having
raised
the
vessels
in
such
a
manner
that
he
could
place
a
ligature
around
the
former
without
including
the
latter
found
that
the
flow
of
blood
from
a
puncture
made
below
a
ligature
on
the
vein
was
rapid
or
slow
according
as
the
heart
was
allowed
to
produce
a
greater
or
less
degree
of
tension
in
the
artery
which
tension
was
regulated
by
compressing
the
artery
between
the
fingers
after
a
similar
preparation
of
a
limb
a
ligature
was
placed
around
the
vein
a
tube
was
then
inserted
into
it
it
was
found
that
the
blood
ascended
in
the
tube
from
the
obstructed
vein
just
as
high
as
from
the
artery
thus
we
are
able
to
trace
the
action
of
the
heart
from
the
beginning
to
the
end
of
the
circle
of
this
circle
it
is
the
sole
moving
power
but
it
is
a
living
engine
acting
in
combination
with
living
vessels
the
force
it
exerts
is
a
vital
force
economized
by
the
agency
of
a
vital
property
communicated
to
the
vessels
by
virtue
of
which
they
spontaneously
and
completely
remove
all
physical
obstruction
to
the
progress
of
the
stream
through
its
channels
some
german
physiologists
of
great
eminence
after
a
careful
and
patient
observation
of
the
blood
have
satisfied
themselves
that
in
addition
to
the
contraction
of
the
heart
it
is
necessary
to
admit
a
second
original
and
independent
motive
force
namely
a
power
inherent
in
the
particles
of
the
blood
itself
the
blood
we
know
is
a
living
substance
no
reason
can
be
assigned
why
the
power
of
originating
motion
should
not
be
communicated
to
such
a
substance
as
well
as
to
the
muscular
fibre
of
which
indeed
one
constituent
of
the
blood
affords
the
basis
such
a
power
if
found
to
be
inherent
in
the
particles
of
the
blood
would
explain
some
phenomena
connected
with
the
circulation
not
yet
clearly
elucidated
but
the
proof
of
the
power
of
the
blood
does
not
yet
seem
to
be
complete
it
is
however
impossible
to
explain
the
phenomena
of
the
circulation
or
to
obtain
a
satisfactory
view
of
some
of
the
other
functions
of
the
economy
without
supposing
the
particles
of
the
blood
to
be
endowed
with
a
vital
power
of
repulsion
in
consequence
of
which
they
are
prevented
from
uniting
when
in
contact
and
the
fluidity
of
the
mass
is
maintained
in
this
account
of
the
powers
that
move
the
blood
no
notice
has
been
taken
of
the
physical
agents
supposed
to
act
as
auxiliaries
to
the
heart
in
carrying
on
the
circulation
such
as
the
suction
power
of
the
thorax
and
of
the
auricles
of
the
heart
and
the
capillary
attraction
of
the
vessels
because
without
questioning
the
existence
of
such
agents
or
denying
that
advantage
may
be
taken
of
them
it
seems
pretty
clear
that
their
influence
is
but
trivial
and
they
assumed
importance
only
when
the
vital
endowments
of
the
tissues
were
not
well
understood
the
ultimate
end
for
which
the
apparatus
of
the
circulation
is
constructed
and
for
which
all
its
action
is
exerted
is
to
convey
arterial
blood
to
the
capillary
arteries
these
vessels
are
totally
distinct
in
structure
and
in
office
from
the
larger
arterial
tubes
all
the
tunics
of
these
minute
vessels
diminish
in
thickness
and
strength
as
the
tubes
lessen
in
size
but
more
especially
the
middle
or
the
fibrous
coat
which
according
to
wedemeyer
may
still
be
distinguished
by
its
colour
in
the
transverse
section
of
any
vessel
whose
internal
diameter
is
not
less
than
the
tenth
of
a
line
but
that
it
entirely
disappears
in
vessels
too
small
and
too
remote
to
receive
the
wave
of
blood
in
a
manifest
jet
but
while
the
membranous
tunics
diminish
the
nervous
filaments
distributed
to
them
increase
the
smaller
and
thinner
the
capillary
the
greater
the
proportionate
quantity
of
its
nervous
matter
and
this
is
most
manifest
in
organs
of
the
greatest
irritability
the
coats
of
the
capillaries
successively
becoming
thinner
and
thinner
at
length
disappear
altogether
and
the
vessels
ultimately
terminate
in
membraneless
canals
formed
in
the
substance
of
the
tissues
the
blood
in
the
finest
capillaries
says
wedemeyer
no
longer
flows
within
actual
vessels
it
is
not
contained
in
tubes
whose
parietes
are
formed
by
a
membranous
substance
distinguishable
by
its
texture
and
compactness
from
the
adjoining
cellular
tissue
it
is
contained
in
the
different
tissues
in
channels
which
it
forms
in
them
for
itself
and
under
the
microscope
the
stream
is
seen
easily
and
rapidly
to
work
out
for
itself
a
new
passage
in
the
tissues
which
it
penetrates
some
of
these
fine
capillaries
before
they
entirely
lose
their
membranous
tunics
communicate
directly
with
veins
of
the
capillaries
which
terminate
by
direct
communication
with
veins
some
are
large
enough
to
admit
of
three
or
four
of
the
red
particles
of
the
blood
abreast
the
diameter
of
others
is
sufficient
to
admit
only
of
one
while
others
are
so
small
that
they
can
transmit
nothing
but
the
serum
of
the
blood
as
long
as
the
capillary
is
of
sufficient
magnitude
to
receive
three
or
four
of
the
particles
abreast
it
is
evident
that
it
possesses
regular
parietes
but
by
far
the
greater
number
before
they
communicate
with
veins
lose
altogether
their
membranous
coats
there
are
no
visible
openings
or
pores
in
the
sides
or
ends
of
the
capillaries
by
means
of
which
the
blood
can
be
extravasated
preparatory
to
its
being
imbibed
by
the
veins
there
is
nowhere
apparent
a
sudden
passage
of
the
arterial
into
the
venous
stream
no
abrupt
boundary
between
the
division
of
the
two
systems
the
arterial
streamlet
winds
through
long
routes
and
describes
numerous
turns
before
it
assumes
the
nature
and
takes
the
direction
of
a
venous
streamlet
the
ultimate
capillary
rarely
passes
from
a
large
arterial
into
a
large
venous
branch
the
vital
power
which
it
has
been
shown
is
possessed
by
the
arterial
trunks
and
branches
is
still
more
intense
in
the
minute
capillaries
if
alcohol
strong
acetic
acid
naphtha
and
other
stimulating
fluids
be
injected
into
the
arteries
of
a
living
animal
it
is
found
that
they
are
not
transmitted
through
the
capillaries
at
all
or
at
all
events
that
they
make
their
way
through
them
with
extreme
difficulty
whereas
mild
unirritating
fluids
pass
with
rapidity
and
ease
wedemeyer
exposed
and
divided
the
main
artery
in
the
of
a
horse
together
with
the
corresponding
vein
in
the
shoulder
several
of
tepid
water
were
now
injected
into
the
lower
end
of
the
artery
the
gentlest
pressure
was
sufficient
to
force
the
fluid
through
the
capillaries
at
each
injection
the
water
issued
in
a
full
stream
from
the
aperture
of
the
vein
the
flow
of
the
fluid
ceasing
as
soon
as
the
injection
was
stopped
next
instead
of
water
four
of
pure
cold
brandy
were
injected
to
propel
this
fluid
through
the
capillaries
so
as
to
render
its
smell
and
taste
perceptible
at
the
aperture
of
the
vein
required
a
great
degree
of
pressure
and
when
at
last
the
fluid
issued
from
the
vein
it
merely
trickled
in
a
feeble
stream
the
experiment
being
repeated
on
another
horse
with
vinegar
six
of
which
being
injected
in
rapid
succession
at
first
this
fluid
passed
as
easily
as
water
afterwards
it
flowed
with
greater
difficulty
and
in
a
small
stream
before
long
the
force
required
to
propel
it
was
extreme
and
at
last
the
obstruction
to
its
passage
became
complete
so
that
no
fluid
whatever
issued
from
the
vein
these
experiments
whenever
repeated
afforded
the
same
result
and
they
demonstrate
that
the
capillaries
are
capable
of
being
stimulated
to
contract
upon
their
contents
and
that
they
can
contract
with
such
force
as
to
stop
the
current
it
is
manifest
that
the
power
by
which
they
do
this
is
vital
because
after
death
all
fluids
the
mildest
and
the
most
acrid
pass
through

with
equal
facility
drs
thompson
philip
hastings
and
others
in
this
country
have
applied
stimulants
of
various
kinds
to
the
capillary
arteries
in
order
to
observe
with
the
microscope
the
changes
which
the
vessels
undergo
the
results
of
these
experiments
performed
independently
agree
with
each
other
and
all
the
observers
concur
in
stating
that
those
results
are
so
obvious
and
decisive
as
to
admit
of
no
question
wedemeyer
fully
aware
of
all
that
had
been
done
on
this
subject
by
the
english
physiologists
repeated
their
experiments
with
his
usual
patience
and
care
vigilantly
watching
the
effects
with
his
microscope
his
observations
completely
coincide
with
those
of
our
countrymen
the
circulation
being
observed
in
the
mesentery
of
the
frog
and
in
the
web
of
its
foot
it
was
apparent
that
no
change
whatever
took
place
in
the
diameter
of
the
small
arteries
nor
in
that
of
the
capillaries
as
long
as
the
circulation
was
allowed
to
go
on
in
its
natural
state
but
as
soon
as
stimulants
were
applied
to
them
an
alteration
of
their
diameter
was
visible
alcohol
without
much
apparent
contraction
of
the
vessels
stopped
the
flow
of
the
blood
muriate
of
soda
in
the
course
of
three
or
four
minutes
caused
the
vessels
to
contract
of
their
calibre
which
contraction
was
followed
by
dilatation
and
gradual
retardation
and
stoppage
of
the
blood
ammonia
caused
immediate
and
direct
dilatation
and
the
effect
of
galvanism
was
still
more
striking
in
a
space
of
time
varying
from
ten
to
thirty
seconds
nay
sometimes
immediately
after
the
completion
of
the
galvanic
circle
the
vessels
contracted
some
a
fourth
others
half
and
others
of
their
calibre
the
flow
of
the
blood
through
the
contracted
vessels
was
accelerated
the
contraction
sometimes
lasted
a
considerable
time
occasionally
several
hours
in
other
instances
the
contraction
ceased
in
ten
minutes
and
the
vessels
resumed
their
natural
diameter
a
second
application
of
galvanism
to
the
same
capillaries
seldom
caused
any
material
contraction
the
evidence
then
is
abundant
that
stimulants
are
capable
of
modifying
to
a
great
extent
the
action
of
the
capillary
arteries
sometimes
causing
them
to
contract
at
other
times
to
dilate
sometimes
quickening
the
flow
of
blood
through
them
at
other
times
retarding
it
and
frequently
altogether
arresting
its
motion
this
contractile
power
of
the
capillaries
must
be
a
vital
endowment
for
no
such
property
is
possessed
by
any
substance
destitute
of
life
and
there
is
satisfactory
evidence
that
it
is
communicated
regulated
and
controlled
by
the
organic
nerves
which
as
has
been
shown
increase
as
the
size
of
the
vessels
and
the
thickness
of
their
membranous
tunics
diminish
the
powerful
influence
of
these
nerves
upon
the
capillary
vessels
is
placed
beyond
doubt
or
controversy
by
the
obvious
local
changes
produced
in
the
capillary

from
the

urged
by
the
vital

of
the

the

the
extreme

most
of
these
capillaries
terminate
in
canals
which
they
work
out
for
themselves
in
the
substance
of
the

the

are
endowed
with
a
vital
attractive
force
which
they
exert
upon
the
elective
as
well
as

of

the

the
heart
the
lung
the
muscle
the

the
bone
each
tissue
attracts
only
those
constituents
of
which
it
is
itself
composed
thus
the
common
current
rich
in
all
the
proximate
constituents
of
the
tissues
flows
out
to
each
as
the
current
approaches
the

the

of
the

identified
with
it
and
are
changed
into
its
own
true

proper
nature
meantime
the
particles
which
are
not
appropriate
to
that
particular
tissue
not
being
attracted
by
it
do
not
quit
the
current
but
passing
on
are
borne
by
other
capillaries
to
other
tissues
to
which
they
are
appropriate
and
by
which
they
are
apprehended
and
assimilated
when
it
has
given
to
the
tissues
the
constituents
with
which
it
abounded
and
received
from

no
longer
useful

which

the
blood
flows
into
the
veins
to
be
returned
by
the
pulmonic
heart
to
the
lung
where
parting
with
the
useless
and
noxious
matter
it
has
accumulated
and
replenished
with
new
proximate
principles
it
returns
to
the
systemic
heart
by
which
it
is
again
sent

particles

but
all
that
we
can
see
with
the
best
aid
we
can
get
does
but
bring
us
to
the
confines
of
the
grand
operations
that
go
on
of
which
we
are
altogether
ignorant
arterial
blood
is
conveyed
by

to

before
it
has
passed
from

influence
of
the

it
has
ceased
to
be
arterial

arterial
blood
is
conveyed
by
the
carotid
artery
to
the
brain
but
the
cerebral
capillaries
do
not
deposit

but
brain
arterial
blood
is
conveyed
by
its
nutrient
arteries
to
bone
but
the
osseous
capillaries
do
not

but
bone
arterial
blood
is
conveyed
by
the
muscular
arteries
to
muscle
but
the
muscular
capillaries
do
not
deposit

but
muscle
the
blood
conveyed
by
the
capillaries
of
brain
bone
and
muscle
is
the
same
all
comes
alike
from
the
systemic
heart
and
is
alike
conveyed
to
all
tissues
yet
in
the
one
it
becomes
brain
in
the
other
bone
and
in
the
third
muscle
out
of
one
and
the
same
fluid
these
living
chemists
manufacture
cuticle
and
membrane
and
muscle
and
brain
and
bone
the
tears
the
wax
the
fat
the
saliva
the
gastric
juice
the
milk
the
bile
all
the
fluids
and
all
the
solids
of
the
body
and
they
do
still
more
for
they
are
architects
as
well
as
chemists
after
they
have
manufactured
the
tissue
they
construct
the
organ
the
capillaries
of
the
eye
not
only
form
its
different
membranes
and
humours
but
arrange
them
in
such
a
manner
as
to
constitute
the
optical
instrument
and
the
capillaries
of
the
brain
not
only
form
cerebral
matter
but
build
it
up
into
the
instrument
of
sensation
thought
and
motion
the
practical
applications
of
these
phenomena
are
numerous
and
most
important
but
they
can
be
clearly
and
impressively
stated
only
when
the
operation
of
the
physical
agents
which
influence
the
circulation
and
which
proportionally
affect
life
and
health
has
been
explained

whenever

to

of

the
powers
of
the
anastomosing

are
capable
of
being
increased
to
a
surprising
extent
the

itself
has
frequently
been
tied
in
animals
of
considerable

without
destroying
life
in
the

it
has
also
been
found
obliterated
by

the
