many

foods
the
question
of
eating
special
food
on
a
particular
day
immediately
brings
in
mind
thanksgiving
day
when
turkey
becomes
the
universal
dish
perhaps
no
other
day
in
the
year
can
be
so
designated
except
among
a
few
religious
orders
when
the
eating
of
meat
is
strictly
prohibited
on
certain
days
the
belief
that
negroes
are
particularly
addicted
to
eating
pork
is
well
founded
as
witness
the
sales
of
pork
to
colored
people
in
most
any
meat
market
but
who
could
imagine
that
was
once
the
universal
food
eaten
in
this
vicinity
by
the
colored
people
that
according
to
doc
quinn
a
former
slave
and
exmember
of
cullen
gang
was
the
custom
before
and
shortly
after
the
civil
war
the
would
be
dumped
into
a
hugh
pot
and
boiled
for
several
hours
the
seed
gradually
rising
to
the
top
the
seed
would
then
be
dipped
off
with
a
ladle
the
next
and
final
step
would
be
to
pour
into
the
thick
liquid
after
which
it
was
ready
to
be
eaten
it
must
be
remembered
had
little
value
at
that
time
except
as
livestock
feed
yes
suh
the
old
negro
went
on
to
explain
i
has
never
eaten
anything
whut
tasted
any
better
or
whut
would
stick
to
your
ribs
like
and
cake
rich
why
dey
nuthin
dat
is
more
nutritious
you
never
saw
a
healthier
or
finer
lookin
bunch
of
negroes
dan
wuz

harvey

we

one

superstitious
beliefs
among
negroes
some
aged
negroes
believe
that
many
of
the
superstitious
ideas
that
are
practiced
by
their
race
today
had
their
origin
in
africa
a
practice
that
was
quite
common
in
ante
bellum
days
was
for
each
member
of
the
family
to
extract
all
of
their
teeth
in
the
belief
that
in
doing
so
the
family
would
never
disagree
fortunately
this
and
similar
practices
of
self
mutilation
have
about
become
extinct
an
old
custom
practiced
to
prevent
the
separation
of
a
husband
and
wife
was
to
wrap
a
rabbit
forefoot
a
piece
of
loadstone
and
hairs
from
the
top
of
the
head
in
red
flannel
and
bury
it
under
the
front
door
steps
as
a
preventitive
against
being
tricked
or
punch
a
hole
through
a
dime
insert
a
string
through
the
hole
and
tie
it
around
the
left
ankle
to
carry
an
axe
or
hoe
into
the
house

luck
an
itching
nose

eyesight
from
the
ill
treatment
she
got
so
before

nowhere
i
do
know
what
it
was
they
done
to
her
that

it
was
due
to
bad
treatment
in
slavery

master
the
pateroles
would
run
them
and
catch
them
and
whip
them
how
freedom

all
my
mother
knew
was
that
it
got
out
that
the
negroes
were
free
the
day
before
the
old
woman
told
them
that
they
were
free
my

message
three
weeks
after

time
they

her
out
of

breakdowns
in
slave
time
breakdown
dances
with
fiddle
and
banjo
music
far
after
slavery
they
had
them
the
only
other
amusement
worth
speaking
about
was
the
churches
far
as
the
churches
was
concerned
they
had
to
steal
out
and
go
to
them
old
man
balm
whitlow
can
tell
you
all
about
the
way
they
held
church
they
would
slip
off
in
the
woods
and
carry
a
gang
of
darkies
down
and
the
next
morning
old
master
would
whip
them
for
it
next
sunday
they
would
do
the
same
thing
again
and
get
another
whipping
and
it
went
on
like
that
every
week
when
old
man
whitlow
came
out
from
slavery
he
continued
to
preach
but
the
darkies
did
have
to
steal
out
then
he
dead
now
him
and
the
old
lady
both
houses
the
slaves
lived
in
old
log
houses
some
of
them
would
be
hewed
and
put
up
well
i
have
seen
lots
of
them
sometimes
they
would
dob
the
cracks
with
mud
and
would
have
box
planks
floors
one
by
eight
or
one
by
ten
rough
lumber
not
dressed
set
as
close
together
as
they
could
but
then
there
would
be
cracks
in
them
i
can
carry
you
to
some
old
log
houses
down
in
union
county
now

in
slavery
time
he
drove

we
ai
never
whipped
him
ourselves
i

ku
klux
klan

thing
only
the
klan
was
more
up
to
date
it
all
set
up
with
a
hellish
principle
it
old
pharaoh
exactly
the
ku
klux
klan
did
have
no
particular
effect
on
the
negro
except
to
scare
him
when
the
emancipation
came
about
the
people
of
the
south
went
to
work
to
see
what
they
could
do
about
it
the
whole
south
was
under
martial
law
some
of
the
people
formed
the
ku
klux
klan
to
keep
the
negro
down
i
never
remember
that
they
bothered
any
of
our
family
or
the
people
in
our
house
but
they
scared
some
and
whipped
more
and
killed
some
political
trouble
about
the
darkies
and
the
white
folks
in
union
county
had
an
insurrection
over

they
went
around
and
commanded
the
negroes

some
of

on
monday
they
went
around
through

county
in
gangs

the
negroes
did
have
no

that
way
quite
a

their
homes
and
went
into
different
counties

the
world
should
rule
the
other
of
the
world
is
white
the
bible
says
a
house
divided
ca
stand
the
people
know
what
to
do
look
how
they
fight
the
wage
hour
bill
look
at
the
excitement
they
raised
when
it
was
first
suggested
that
the
union
and
confederate
veterans
meet
together
we
were
savages
when
we
came
over
here
everything
we
got
and
everything
we
know
good
and
bad
we
got
from
the
white
folks
know
how
they
can
get
impatient
with
us
when
everything
we
do
they
learnt
us
roosevelt
has
done
more
than
any
democrat
that
has
ever
been
in
the
chair
he
had
to
do
something
to
keep
down
a
rebellion
then
we
like
to
had
one
as
it
is
through
the
labor
question
the
poor
white
man
always
has
been
in
a
tight
hw
place
he
was
almost
as
much
oppressed
as
the
negro
the
young
people
of
today
ai
got
no
sense
they
do
give
no
thought
to
nothing
they
do
know
how
to
think
at
all
all
the
schools
and
education
they
give
do
make
them
think
if
i
had
as
much
education
as
they
have
i
would
be
able
to
accomplish
something
the
teachers
do
press
down
on
them
and
make
them
know
what
they
go
over
there
is
a
whole
lot
of
things
happening
now
old
people
in
pulaski
county
out
in
pulaski
county
going
west
out
the
nineteenth
street
pike
till
you
strike
the
saline
county
line
there
are
quite
a
few
old
colored
people
i
guess
you
would
find
no
leas
than
or
thirty
out
that
way
there
is
one
old
man
named
junius
peterson
out
that
way
who
used
to
run
a
mill
if
you
find
him
he
is
very
old
and
has
a
good
memory
he
is
a
mulatto
you
could
get
out
to
him
by
going
down
till
you
come
to
a
place
that
is
called
the
henderson
lane
you
turn
to
the
right
and
go
off
the
pike
less
than
a
mile
and
you
come
to
a
big
house
settin
on
a
hill
where
peterson
lives
right
on
beyond
that
about
of
a
mile
on
the
right
side
of
the
road
you
come
to
george
gregory
the
mother
of
my
church
is
about
years
old
but
she
is
over
in
saline
county
her
name
is
jane
joyner
there
are
quite
a
few
old
persons
around
woodson
that
can
give
you
information
but
that
is
in
saline
county
i
think
sweet
home
wrightsville
toltec
all
of
them
have
a
few
old
colored
persons
on
the
farm
that
was
here
in
slavery
times
interviewer
comment
reeves
story
was
taken
because
of
his
clear
memories
of
his
parents
and
grandparents
he
described
to
me
an
old
log
house
still
standing
in
union
county
i
got
all
agog
with
excitement
i
asked
him
for
the
exact
location
he
gave
it
then
i
suggested
that
maybe
he
would
go
down
with
me
sometime
to
visit
it
he
agreed
then
at
the
last
moment
caution
began
to
assert
itself
and
i
said
when
was
the
last
time
you
saw
the
cabin
he
reflected
a
moment
then
he
said
waal
i
guess
it
was
a
little
more
fifty
years
ago
i
lost
my
enthusiasm
reeves
told
the
story
which
was
told
by
austin
pen
parnell
you
will
find
it
in
his
story
the
only
difference
between
his
story
and
parnell
is
that
reeves
had
the
conclusion
he
claimed
that
the
old
master
got
in
a
fight
with
one
of
the
slaves
present
and
yelled
out
his
identity
when
he
was
getting
badly
beaten
the
story
sounds
like
it
came
from
the
arkansas
folklore
collection
or
from
someone
who
contributed
it
to
that
collection
an
aftermath
of
reeves
story
is
finding
out
that
most
people
consider
henry
banner
whose
story
has
been
previously
given
and
whose
age
was
given
as
is
considered
by
many
persons
to
be
neely
one
of
the
adult
says
that
he
has
gone
over
banner
life
carefully
with
him
and
that
he
must
have
been
or
at
the
close
of
the
war
because
during
slavery
he
had
experience
at
logging
or
rather
at
logrolling
a
work
so
difficult
that
only
men
were
used
at
it
since
banner
is
slightly
built
there
is
scarcely
a
possibility
that
he
did
such
work
before
the
normal
time

i
remember

did
get
it
from

though
his
brother
gave
it
to
me
his
brother
sent
me
to
get
a
horse
an
old
hound
was
laying
in
the
way
on
the
saddle
and
the
bridle
he
would
move
so
i
picked
up
the
bridle
and
hit
him
with
it
he
hollered
and
master
brother
heard
him
and
gave
me
a
whipping
that
is
the
only
whipping
i
ever
got
when
i
was
small
ku
klux
i
heard
of
the
ku
klux
klan
but
i
do
know
that
i
ever
seen
them
i
never
noticed
what
effect
they
had
on
the
colored
people
i
just
heard
people
talking
about
them
occupational
experiences
the
first
work
i
did
was
farming
after
the
war
i
farmed
down
close
to
el
dorado
about
six
miles
away
from
there
i
kept
that
up
till
i
was
about
seventeen
or
eighteen
years
old
or
somewheres
about
there
that
was
on
james
goodwin
place
my
last
master
the
man
who
raised
me
then
i
left
him
and
came
to
little
rock
i
do
remember
in
what
year
i
went
to
school
here
in
little
rock
i
had
already
had
some
schooling
my
grandmother
sent
me
the
school
i
went
to
was
called
the
union
school
it
was
down
on
sixth
street
after
i
left
there
i
went
to
capitol
hill
school
i
was
going
to
school
during
the
war
the
statehouse
was
on
markham
street
and
center
my
grandmother
name
was
celie
robinson
she
went
by
the
name
of
her
owner
after
i
had
gone
to
school
several
years
i
do
remember
just
how
many
i
worked
down
town
about
ten
or
eleven
years
then
i
went
to
railroading
first
i
was
with
the
iron
mountain
and
southern
later
it
changed
its
name
to
the
missouri
pacific
i
worked
for
them
from
to
on
august
i
received
my
last
pay
check
i
have
tried
ever
since
to
get
my
railroad
pension
to
which
my
years
of
service
entitle
me
but
have
been
unable
to
get
it
the
law
concerning
the
pension
seems
to
have
passed
on
the
same
day
i
received
my
last
check
and
although
i
worked
for
years
and
gave
entire
satisfaction
there
has
been
a
disposition
to
keep
me
from
the
pension
while
in
service
i
had
my
jaw
broken
in
two
pieces
and
four
front
teeth
knocked
out
by
a
piece
of
flying
steel
another
man
was
handling
the
steam
hammer
i
was
standing
at
my
regular
place
doing
my
regular
work
when
that
happened
i
was
cut
down
like
a
weed
there
was
a
man
ever
thought
they
would
see
me
in
that
job
again
after
that
piece
of
steel
cut
me
down
also
i
lost
my
right
eye
in
the
service
when
a
hot
cinder
from
the
furnace
flew
in
it
while
i
was
doing
my
regular
work
then
i
was
ruptured
because
of
the
handling
of
heavy
pieces
of
iron
at
my
work
i
still
wear
the
truss
you
can
see
the
places
where
my
jaw
was
broke
and
you
can
see
where
my
teeth
were
knocked
out
out
of
all
the
ups
and
downs
i
stuck
to
the
company
just
the
same
until
they
retired
me
in
because
of
old
age
the
retirement
board
wanted
to
know
when
i
asked
for
a
pension
why
did
i
think
i
was
entitled
to
a
pension
i
told
them
because
i
had
been
injured
through
service
with
the
company
and
had
honorably
finished
so
long
a
period
of
service
it
is
now
admitted
that
i
am
eligible
to
a
railroad
pension
but
there
seems
to
still
be
a
delay
in
paying
it
for
some
reason
or
other
support
now
i
get
a
little
assistance
from
the
welfare
and
i
get
some
commodities

it

aged

lives
with
his

on
outskirts
of
hot
springs
as
i
entered
goldstein
grade
school
for
colored
i
passed
an
old
fellow
sitting
on
the
sidewalk
there
was
somthing
of
that
venerable
dignified
look
about
him
so
much
of
it
that
i
almost
stopped
to
question
him
inside
i
entered
a
classroom
where
a
young
woman
was
in
conference
with
a
couple
of
sheepish
youngsters
who
had
been
kept
in
after
school
did
she
know
the
whereabouts
of
any
she
beamed
only
the
other
day
an
old
man
had
appeared
on
the
school
grounds
she
appealed
to
her
charges
did
they
remember
that
she
had
told
them
about
him
and
about
what
slavery
had
meant
sheepish
looks
were
gone
they
were
agog
with
interest
yes
they
remembered
but
none
of
the
three
knew
his
name
or
where
to
find
him
another
teacher
entered
the
room
no
she
could
remember
the
name
but
the
old
man
often
came
up
to
watch
the
children
at
play
he
said
it
made
him
happy
to
see
them
getting
opportunities
he
never
could
have
had
wait
a
minute
he
might
be
outside
at
this
very
moment
a
clatter
of
heels
and
calls
of
triumph
yes
yes
here
he
is
outside
i
dashed
to
flat
on
the
hw
beside
the
aged
man
i
had
passed
a
few
minutes
before
out
came
my
smile
and
a
notebook
with
only
a
few
preliminaries
and
amenities
the
interview
was
in
full
swing
it
neither
startled
nor
confused
him
to
have
an
excited
young
woman
plant
herself
on
a
public
sidewalk
at
his
side
and
demand
his
life
story
a
man
who
had
belonged
to
three
different
masters
before
the
age
of
was
inured
to
minor
surprises
tom
robinson
long
since
learned
to
take
life
as
it
came
he
is
quite
deaf
in
one
ear
and
hears
poorly
with
the
other
nobody
within
a
quarter
of
a
block
could
have
been
in
doubt
of
what
was
going
on
a
youth
moved
closer
the
pair
emerged
from
the
building
and
stood
near
us
thruout
the
interview
when
we
were
finished
robinson
turned
to
the
children
and
gave
them
a
grandfatherly
lecture
about
taking
advantage
of
their
opportunities
a
lecture
in
which
the
white
woman
sitting
beside
him
joined
heartily
drawing
liberally
on
comments
of
in
recent
interviews
concerning
the
helplessness
felt
in
not
being
able
to
write
and
read
letters
from
well
loved
friends
where
was
i
born
why
it
my
understanding
that
it
was
catawba
county
north
carolina
as
far
as
i
remember
newton
was
the
nearest
town
i
was
born
on
a
place
belonging
to
jacob
sigmens
i
can
just
barely
remember
my
mother
i
was
not
when
they
sold
me
away
from
her
i
can
just
barely
remember
her
but
i
do
remember
how
she
used
to
take
us
children
and
kneel
down
in
front
of
the
fireplace
and
pray
she
pray
that
the
time
would
come
when
everybody
could
worship
the
lord
under
their
own
vine
and
fig
tree
all
of
them
free
it
come
to
me
lots
of
times
since
there
she
was
and
on
other
plantations
women
was
all
over
the
country
the
same
prayer
was
being
prayed
guess
the
lord
done
heard
the
prayer
and
answered
it
old
man
sigmens
was
a
bad
master
do
remember
so
much
about
him
i
could
have
been
when
he
sold
me
to
pickney
setzer
he
kept
me
for
a
little
while
and
then
he
sold
me
to
david
robinson
all
three
of
them
lived
not
so
far
apart
in
north
carolina
but
pretty
soon

me
old
men
dave
robinson
moved
to
texas
we
was
there
when
the
war
started
we
stayed
there
all
during
the
war
i
was
set
free
there
we
lived
in
cass
county
it
was
pretty
close
to
the
arkansas
border
and
was
far
from
oklahoma
as
is
now
i
remember
well
when
they
was
first
gathering
them
up
for
the
war
we
used
to
hear
the
cannon
often
was
i
afraid
to
be
sure
i
was
scared
right
at
first
pretty
soon
we
got
used
to
it
somebody
even
made
up
a
song
to
the
thunder
they
sing
it
every
time
the
cannon
started
roaring
no
there
never
was
any
fighting
right
around
us
i
never
really
saw
any
fighting
old
man
dave
robinson
was
good
to
me
he
did
have
a
big
farm
just
owned
me
treated
me
almost
like
i
was
one
of
his
own
children
course
i
had
to
work
sometimes
he
whipped
me
but
no
more
than
he
had
to
i
was
just
a
child
and
any
child
has
got
to
be
made
to
mind
he
was
good
to
me
and
old
miss
was
good
to
me
all
my
masters
was
pretty
good
to
me
lots
better
than
the
usual
run
which
one
i
like
the
best
well
you
might
know
i
kept
the
name
robinson
and
i
named
my
son
dave
you
might
know
which
one
i
think
the
most
of
one
day
i
was
out
milking
the
cows
dave
come
down
into
the
field
and
he
had
a
paper
in
his
hand
to
me
tom
he
said
to
what
i
reads
you
and
he
read
from
a
paper
all
about
how
i
was
free
you
ca
tell
how
i
felt
jokin
me
i
says
i
ai
says
he
free
says
i
a
joke
says
he
a
law
that
i
got
to
read
this
paper
to
you
now
listen
while
i
read
it
again
but
still
i
would
believe
him
go
up
to
the
house
says
he
ask
robinson
she
tell
you
so
i
went
a
joke
i
says
to
her
you
ever
know
your
master
to
tell
you
a
lie
she
says
says
i
ai
she
says
war
over
and
you
free
by
that
time
i
thought
maybe
she
was
telling
me
what
was
right
robinson
says
i
i
go
over
to
see
the
smiths
they
was
a
colored
family
that
lived
nearby
you
understand
says
she
free
you
do
have
to
ask
me
what
you
can
do
run
along
child
and
so
i
went
and
do
you
know
why
i
was
i
wanted
to
find
out
if
they
was
free
too
a
chuckle
and
toothy
smile
i
just
take
it
all
in
i
could
believe
we
was
all
free
alike
was
i
happy
law
miss
you
can
take
anything
no
matter
how
good
you
treat
it
it
wants
to
be
free
you
can
treat
it
good
and
feed
it
good
and
give
it
everything
it
seems
to
want
but
if
you
open
the
cage

a
socially

are
drawn
between
the
different
classes
of

both
by
owners
and
tenants
themselves
families
whom
ambition
and
circumstances
have
allowed
to
accumulate
enough
surplus
to
buy
farm
implements
and
have
food
for
a
year
ahead
look
with
scorn
on
fellow
farmers
who
thru
inertia
or
bad
luck
must
be
furnished
food
and
the
wherewithall
to
farm
in

families
that
have
forged

we
has
a
little
garden
interviewer
miss
irene
robertson
person
interviewed
william
henry
rooks
baptist
preacher
brinkley
arkansas
age
the
slaves
did
spect
nothing
but
freedom
jes
freedom
in
africa
they
was
free
as
wild
animals
and
then
they
was
so
restricted
jes
put
in
bondage
for
no
reason
at
all
no
plantations
was
divided
i
was
born
a
slave
and
i
remembers
right
smart
how
it
was
my
master
was
john
freeman
and
his
wife
name
was
fannie
i
went
to
como
mississippi
twice
a
week
to
get
the
mail
all
durin
the
war
it
was
eight
miles
i
rode
a
pony
if
you
go
to
church
you
have
to
have
a
pass
from
the
master
the
pattyrollers
see
you
and
you
have
to
show
it
to
them
it
was
just
a
note
if
you
did
have
it
they
take
or
send
you
home
if
they
catch
you
any
more
without
a
pass
they
whip
you
they
come
to
the
church
and
in
all
public
places
like
the
police
stands
around
now
they
rode
around
mostly
sometimes
they
went
in
droves
they
would
let
you
go
visiting
sometimes
and
exchange
work
some
masters
was
good
and
some
was
mean
jess
like
they
are
now
and
some
slaves
good
and
some
bad
that
is
the
way
they
are
now
some
of
the
white
men
had
a
hundred
slaves
and
had
plenty
money
the
war
broke
nearly
all
of
them
the
very
worse
thing
i
ever
knowed
about
it
was
some
white
men
raised
hands
to
sell
like
they
raise
stock
now
it
was
hard
to
have
your
child
took
off
and
never
see
or
hear
tell
of
it
mean
man
buy
it
and
beat
it
up
some
of
them
was
drove
off
to
be
sold
at
auction
at
new
orleans
that
was
where
some
took
them
cause
they
could
get
big
money
for
them
i
never
knowed
of
a
master
to
give
the
slaves
a
dime
when
they
become
free
they
never
promissed
them
nothing
the
yankees
might
have
to
toll
them
off
the
hands
all
stayed
on
john
freeman
place
and
when
it
was
over
he
give
them
the
privilege
of
staying
right
on
in
their
houses
some
left
after
awhile
and
went
somewhere
they
thought
they
could
do
better
they
did
have
the
ku
klux
but
it
was
bout
like
it
what
they
had
they
wore
caps
shine
de
coons
eye
and
red
caps
and
red
garments
red
symbolize
blood
reason
they
wore
red
they
broke
up
our
preaching
some
folks
got
killed
some
was
old
some
young
old
devlish

was
like
a
drove
of
varments

lot
of
times

interviewer
comment
you
ca
get
the
whole
story
by
reading
the
words
in
this
interview
you
have
to
hear
the
tones
and
the
accents
and
see
the
facial
expressions
and
bodily
movements
and
sense
the
sometimes
almost
occult
influence
you
have
to
feel
the
utter
lack
of
resentment
that
lies
behind
the
words
that
sound

when
read
you
marvel
at
the
quick
smooth
when
something
is
to
be
withheld
at
the
unexpected
vigor
of
the
mind
when
the
bait

attractive
enough
to
draw
it
out

at
the
sweetness
of
the
disposition
some
old
people
merely
get
mellowed
and
sweetened
by
the
hardships
through
which
they
have

wonder
if
some
of
the
old

do
have
dispositions
that
they
can
turn
off
or
on
at
will

is
not
hard
to
realize
the
reason
why
amanda

treated
better

she
was
a

they
was
bothered
by
the
ku
klux
one
night
they
heard
or
saw
the
ku
klux
coming
the
log
house
set
low
on
the
ground
but
was
dug
out
to
keep
potatoes
and
things
in
a
cellar
like
the
planks
was
wide
bout
a
foot
wide
rough
pine
not
nailed
down
they
lifted
the
planks
up
and
all
lay
down
and
put
the
planks
back
up
the

look
like
outside
nothing
could
go
under
it
it
was
setting
on
the
hard
ground
when
they
got
there
and
opened
the

they
saw
nobody
at

a
soldier
strided
a
block
step
with

interviewer
comment
the
old
lady
style
was
kind
of
cramped
by
the
presence
of
her
husband
every
once
in
a
while
when
she
would
be
about
to
paint
something
in
lurid
colors
he
would
drop
in
a
word
and
she
would
roll
her
phrases
around
in
her
mouth
so
to
speak
and
shift
and
go
ahead
in
a
different
direction
and
on
another
gear
very
pleasant
couple
though
with
none
of
the
bitterness
that
old
age
brings
sometimes

my
master
was
my
daddy
that
what
they
told
me
of
course
i
do
know
myself
but
then
white
folks
did
anything
they
wanted
to
in
slavery
times
my
mother
name
was
morina
ruffin
i
do
know
the
names
of
my
grandparents
that
is
too
far
back
in
slavery
for
me
of
course
old
man
ruffin
my

he

before

my

kilt
in
the

his

went
out
of
all
his
niggers
he
did
have
but
one
with
him
that
was
in
slavery
time
and
he
was
a
fool
about
her
i
could
tell
you
exactly
when
i
was
born
up
until
the
surrender
i
could
tell
how
old
i
was
i
am
somewheres
around
years
old
the
old
lady
is
just
about
the
same
we
guesses
it
in
part
we
figure
it
on
what
we
heard
the
old
folks
say
and
things
like
that
i
remember
plenty
of
things
about
slavery
that
i
saw
i
never
did
much
when
i
was
a
boy
the
biggest
thing
i
remember
is
a
mule
got
to
kicking
and
jumped
around
in
a
stall
she
lost
her
footing
and
fell
down
and
broke
her
neck
right
there
in
the
stall
i
remember
her
name
as
well
as
if
it
was
yesterday
her
name
was
bird
that
was
just
before
the
war
i
know
i
must
have
been
at
least
four
years
old
then
you
can
figure
that
up
and
see
what
it
comes
to
i
never
did
any
work
when
i
was
a
child
i
jus
went
to
the
spring
with
the
young
mistress
and
danced
for
them
sometimes
but
they
never
did
give
me
any
work
to
do
like
they
did
the
others
i
lived
right
in
the
biggest
house
the
biggest
portion
of
my
time
that
day
and
time
they
made
compost
heaps
mixed
dirt
with
manure
they
hoed
cotton
and
crops
they
did
know
what
school
was
they
helped
with
washing
and
ironing
did
every
kind
of
work
they
had
strength
enough
to
do
till
they
got
big
enough
to
go
to
the
field
that
was
what
the
children
did
when
they
were
about
seven
years
old
to
the
best
of
my
recollection
they
would
go
to
the
field
seven
or
eight
they
would
pick
up
corn
stalks
and
brush
and
from
that
on
when
they
were
about
eight
or
nine
they
would
pick
cotton
my
mother
never
did
have
to
do
anything
round
the
farm
she
lived
about
miles
from
it
there
where
the
master
had
his
office
he
was
a
lawyer
after
i
was
born
she
did
come
out
to
see
me
but
once
a
year
that
i
recollect
when
she
did
come
she
would
bring
me
some
candy
or
cakes
or
something
like
that
i
did
see
the
soldiers
during
the
time
of
the
war
but
i
saw
plenty
of
them
afterwards
riding
round
and
telling
the
niggers
they
were
free
they
had
some
of
the
finest
saddles
i
ever
seed
you
could
hear
them
creaking
a
block
off
no
i
did
see
them
while
they
was
fighting
we
were
close
enough
to
hear
the
guns
crash
and
we
could
see
the
light
from
them
but
i
did
actually
see
the
fightin
the
yankees
come
through
on
every
plantation
where
they
were
working
and
entered
into
every
house
and
told
us
we
was
free
the
yankees
did
it
they
told
you
you
were
free
as
they
were
that
you
did
have
to
stay
where
you
was
that
you
did
have
no
more
master
that
you
could
go
and
come
as
you
pleased
i
got
along
after
i
was
freed
it
is
a
hard
matter
to
tell
you
what
we
could
find
or
get
we
used
to
dig
up
dirt
in
the
smokehouse
and
boil
it
and
dry
it
and
sift
it
to
get
the
salt
to
season
our
food
with
we
used
to
go
out
and
get
old
bones
that
had
been
throwed
away
and
crack
them
open
and
get
the
marrow
and
use
them
to
season
the
greens
with
jus
plenty
of
niggers
then
did
have
anything
but
that
to
eat
even
in
slavery
times
there
was
plenty
of
niggers
out
of
them
three
hundred
slaves
who
had
to
break
up
old
lard
gourds
and
use
them
for
meat
they
had
to
pick
up
bones
off
the
dung
hill
and
crack
them
open
to
cook
with
and
then
of
course
they
steal
had
to
steal
that
the
bes
way
to
git
what
they
wanted
they
had
a
great
big
kitchen
for
the
slaves
they
had
what
you
call
pot
racks
they
could
push
them
big
pots
in
and
out
on
they
cooked
hog
slop
there
they
had
trays
and
bowls
to
eat
out
of
that
were
made
out
of
gum
wood
it
was
a
long
house
used
as
a
kitchen
for
the
hands
to
go
in
and
eat
they
et
dinner
there
and
for
supper
they
would
be
there
but
breakfast
they
would
have
to
eat
in
the
field
the
young
niggers
would
bring
it
out
to
them
they
would
bring
it
about
an
hour
after
the
sun
rose
and
the
slave
hands
would
eat
it
right
out
in
the
field
that
was
the
breakfast
you
see
the
hands
went
to
the
field
before
sunup
and
they
did
get
to
eat
breakfast
in
the
kitchen
and
it
had
to
be
et
in
the
field
little
undergrowth
of
children
they
had
plenty
of
them
on
the
place
had
to
carry
their
meals
to
them
they
would
usually
give
them
collars
hw
collards
in
green
times
potatoes
in
potato
time
bread
they
did
know
what
that
was
white
folks
hardly
knew
theirselves
they
did
have
butter
and
they
have
no
sugar
did
know
much
about
what
meat
was
yet
they
would
give
the
little
bits
of
children
pot
liquor
that
the
most
i
ever
seed
them
git
of
course
i
was
treated
differently
you
could
judge
them
by
me
i
was
the
only
youngun
round
there
and
they
said
i
was
to
ol
marse
chillun
and
the
white
chillen
would
git
me
up
to
the
house
to
dance
for
them
and
all
like
and
they
would
give
me
biscuits
or
anything
good
they
had
i
never
seed
the
others
eatin
nothin
but
pot
liquor
most
of
the
slaves
lived
in
log
cabins
you
know
they
never
had
but
one
door
in
general
where
they
had
large
families
they
would
have
two
rooms
with
a
chimney
in
the
middle
of
the
house
the
chimney
was
built
out
of
mud
and
straw
i
can
remember
them
sawin
the
timber
two
pulled
a
big
ol
crosscut
saw
did
have
no
saw
mills
then
this
world
has
come
from
a
long
ways
they
used
to
did
have
no
plows
it
was
without
form
you
made
it
at
home
they
had
ol
homemade
bedsteads
to
sleep
in
they
had
a
little
rope
that
ran
back
and
forth
instead
of
slats
that
was
called
a
corded
bed
cheers
were
all
made
at
home
and
were
split
bottoms
they
did
many
of
the
slaves
have
food
in
their
homes
but
when
they
did
they
would
jus
have
a
little
wooden
box
and
they
would
put
their
food
in
it
it
seems
like
the
white
people
got
to
burying
their
money
during
the
time
of
the
war
that
never
come
out
till
after
the
war
then
they
got
to
wantin
that
money
and
started
looking
for
it
there
never
was
any
talk
of
buried
treasure
before
the
war
my
folks
did
give
me
any
schoolin
before
the
surrender
i
never
got
any
before
the
surrender
and
a
mighty
little
afterwards
no
nigger
knowed
anything
i
started
to
farming
when
i
was
thirteen
years
old
i
used
to
be
a
fertilizer
and
then
a
cotton
sower
that
was
the
biggest
i
knowed
about
farming
when
i
was
a
boy
my
mother
lived
about
fifteen
years
after
slavery
i
reckon
in
the
time
of
slavery
you
could
marry
a
woman
you
just
took
up
with
her
mother
married
the
same
man
she
had
been
going
with
after
freedom
she

two
boys
i

there
one
year
and
then
moved
here
bought
forty
acres
of

bought
it
after

bought
eighty
acres
and
paid
for
them
paid
them
out

then
i
bought
eighty
acres
more
and
paid
for
them
in
two
years
could
pay
for
them
cash
at
first
but
could
have
paid
for
the
last
eighty
when
i
bought
them
if
i
had
a
wanted
to
then
i
bought
eighty
more
and
then
i
bought
eighty
again
and
then
forty
and
on
till
i
had
five
hundred
and
three
acres
of
farm
land
i

all
these
hard
years
my
daughter
kept
after
me
to
come
here
and
she
built
this
little
house
out
here
where
i
could
holler
or
do
anything
i
wanted
to
do
and
not
disturb
nobody
i
could
feel
at
home
up
in
a
big
house
with
other
people
four
or
five
months
ago
it
would
take
two
people
to
put

i
would
get

and
have
to
carry
me

at
home
and
got
along
very
well
we
had
enough
to
eat
and
wear
mistress
was
awful
mean
to
us
but
we
stayed
with
them
until
after
the
war
after
the
war
master
moved
us
off
to
another
place
he
had
and
my
father
farmed
for
his
self
master
and
his
pa
and
ma
and
mistress
pa
and
ma
they
awful
good
to
us
but
mistress
was
so
high
tempered
she
would
get
mad
and
whip
some
of
the
slaves
but
she
never
whipped
any
of
us
she
worried
so
over
the
loss
of
her
slaves
after
the
war
she
went
crazy
we
had
two
white
grand
pas
and
grand
mas
we
colored
children
called
them
grandpa
and
ma
and
uncle
and
aunt
like
the
white
children
did
and
we
did
know
the
difference
the
slaves
was
only
allowed
biscuit
on
christmas
and
sometimes
on
sundays
but
we
had
beef
and
plenty
of
honey
and
everything
after
we
moved
from
the
big
house
mistress
used
to
come
down
to
see
us
an
my
mother
would
cook
dinner
for
her
and
master
he
was
such
a
man
and
the
best
doctor
in
the
state
he
would
come
in
and
take
the
babies
up
mother
had
nine
children
and
get
them
to
sleep
for
my
mother
his
mother
would
come
to
the
kitchen
and
ask
for
a
good
cup
of
coffee
and
mother
would
make
it
for
her
the
master
and
his
family
were
northern
people
and
my
mother
was
given
to
the

by
her
father
and
mother
when
she
married
after
my
father
bought
his
own
farm
about
ten

would
put
us
all
in
an
ox
wagon
and
take
us
back
to
see
our
white
folks
the
mistress
claimed
to
be
a
christian
and
church
member
but
i
see
how
she
could
have
been
she
was
so
mean
i
think
the
present
day
generation
mighty
wicked
seems
like
they
get
worse
instead
of
better
even
the
members
of
the
church
are
not
as
good
as
they
used
to
be
they
do
raise
the
children
like
they
used
to
they
used
to
go
to
sunday
school
and
church
and
take
the
children
now
the
children
do
as
they
please
roam
the
streets
it
is
sad
to
see
how
the
parents
are
raising
the
children
just
feed
them
and
let
them
go
the
children
rule
the
parents

the

met
a
couple
of
plump
colored

laughing

talking
loudly
i
beg
your
pardon
was
her
greeting
can
you
tell
me
where

they
could
and
did
they
were
so
frankly
interested
in
knowing
why
the
white

wanted
emma

that
she
told
them
her
mission
they
were
not
taken
aback
there
was
no
servility
no
resentment
they
were
frankly
charmed
with
the
idea
their
directions
for
finding

became
even
more
explicit

proper
turn
off

a
couple
of
blocks
down

only
the
fact
that
she
could
hear
someone
inside

about
kept
the

hammering
on
the
door
finally
she
was
rewarded
by
a
voice

that
somebody
a
knockin
in
a
moment
the
door
opened
the
question
were
you
a
slave
no
matter
how
delicately
put
is
a
difficult
one
to
ask
but
sanderson
was
helpful
if
doubtful
that
her
story
would
do
much
good
i
was
just
so
little
when

always
unite
with
the
church
whenever
i
go
to
a
place
i
do
care
whether
i
stay
there
or
not
my
mama
master
was
good
as
far
as
white
folks
generally
be
in
slavery
times
he
never
whipped
my
grandmother
nor
my
mother
he
was
good
to
the
field
hands
too
he
never
whipped
them
he
would
feed
them
too
he
had
right
smart
of
field
hands
but
i
do
know
just
how
many
i
do
think
he
ever
sold
any
of
his
slaves
i
think
he
come
by
them
from
his
father
because
i
have
heard
them
say
that
his
father
told
him
before
he
died
never
to
with
black
mammy
that
was
what
he
called
her
and
he
kept
them
altogether
jus
like
his
father
told
him
to
his
father
said
you
to
keep
all
my
negroes
together
and
black
mammy
i
do
want
you
let
her
be
whipped
because
she
nursed
all
of
you
she
said
she
never
was
whipped
once
when
she
got
a
cockle
berry
up
her
nose
and
he
got
it
out
and
gave
her
a
little
brushing
not
as
much
as
grandma
would
have
given
her
he
kept
them
all
in
good
shoes
and
warm
clothes
and
give
them
plenty
to
eat
so
many
of
the
slaves
on
other
plantations
did
have
half
enough
to
eat
and
were
half
naked
and
barefooted
all
the
time

when
i

hear

i
would
run
and
git
under
the

i

a
christian
interviewer
comment
peggy
sloan
memory
is
going
she
is
not
certain
of
the
number
of
children
her
mother
had
although
she
knows
there
were
more
than
seven
because
she
was
the
seventh
she
remembers
nothing
about
her
age
but
she
knows
definitely
that
all
of
her
mother
children
were
born
before
the
war
that
is
before
the
end
of
the
war
since
the
war
ended
years
ago
and
she
was
the
seventh
child
with
possibly
seven
behind
her
i
feel
that
she
could
not
be
younger
than
eighty
she
remembers
definitely
running
at
the
approach
of
men
she
calls
pateroles
during
slavery
time
her
mind
may
be
fading
but
it
is
a
long
way
from
gone
she
questioned
me
closely
about
my
reason
for
getting
statements
from
her
she
had
to
be
definitely
satisfied
before
the
story
could
be
gotten

does
know
exact
age
i
was
born
about
eight
miles
from
williston
south

after

my

and
she

my

never
did
run
across
after
freedom
she
was
older
and
sold
to
other
people
i
think
at
freedom
my
mother
left
and
i
think
grandma
did
too
my
grandpa
was
half
indian
but
i
never
did
see
him
to
remember
what
he
looked
like
our
young
master
is
a
doctor
he
waited
on
my
mother
before
she
died
grandma
was
blind
and
she
lived
with

sylvania
and
she

pretty
fair
treatment
there
my
mother
was

be
a
house
girl
and
cook
i
think

a

say
the
white
folks
took
them
to
church
to
learn
to
pray
then
they
did
allow
them
to
pray
for
freedom
but
i
do
think
they
wanted
freedom
after
they
was
set
free
they
died
up
so
grandma
said
they
had
to
work
harder
my
mother
brought
a
good
price
because
she
was
real
light
color
and
sharp
to
learn

had
six
children

we
was
all
darker
than
she
was

a
long
long
time
ago
now
my
work
when
i
was
a
child
was
farmin
i
did
not
stay
a
child
long
i
been
grown
ever
since
i
was
fourteen
my
father
lived
till
i
was
eleven
and
i
thought
since
i
was
the
oldest
boy
i
could
take
his
place
of
bossin
but
my
mother
would
take
me
down
a
button
hole
lower
whenever
i
got
too
high
before
my
papa
died
we
had
a
good
livin
we
lived
with
his
daughter
and
we
thought
we
lived
in
heaven
my
papa
made
all
of
the
shoes
and
raised
all
of
the
cattle
from
which
he
got
the
hide
we
raised
all
the
wool
to
make
our
wool
clothes
and
made
all
of
the
clothes
we
wore
and
food
we
did
not
know
what
it
was
to
go
to
a
store
to
buy
did
have
to
do
that
you
see
people
now
living
out
of
paper
sacks
every
time
they
get
ready
to
cook
it
go
to
the
store
we
old

of
our
smokehouse
in

we
had
dried
beef
cured
pork
sugar
from
syrup
sweet
potatoes
onions
irish

our
plow
lines
she
had
a
spinning
wheel
and
you
know
how
to
spin
you
can
make
ropes
for
plow
lines
too
just
twist
the
cotton
and
have
it
about
six
inches
long
and
put
it
in
the
loom
and
let
it
go
around
and
around
you
keep
puttin
the
twisted
cotton
in
the
loom
and
step
on
the
peddle
and
no
sooner
than
done
that
was
worked
in
a
rope
now
if
you

to
mouth
not
enough
corn
to
feed
one
mule
no
syrup
no
hogs
no
cows
oh

time
i

hearing
my
mama
many
a
night
ask
god
to
help
her
through
the
struggle
with
her
children
the
more
my
mama
prayed
the
harder
times

overpower
me
i
got
grown
and
mannish
could
nobody
tell
me
a
thing
i
would
steal
i
would
fight
i
would
lie
i
remember
in
i
went
to
church
that
was
about
the
fourth
time
i
had
been
to
church
the
preacher
began
preachin
and
i
went
outdoors
and
cut
the
harness
off
of
his
mule
and
broke
one
of
his
buggy
wheels
i
went
down
in
the
woods
and
cut
a
cow
just
for
meanness
i
stole
a
gun
and
i
would
shoot
anytime
and
anywhere
and
nobody
bothered
me
because
they
was
scared
to
i
stole
chickens
turkeys
and
anything
i
got
in
trouble
more
times
than
a
little
so
the
last
time
i
got
in
trouble
some
white
people
got
me
out
and
i
worked
for
them
to
pay
my
fine
out
while
working
for
them
i
made
shoes
they
taught
me
to
do
carpenter
work
they
taught
me
to
paint
to
paper
to
cook
work
in
the
field
and
do
most
anything
i
came
to
my
senses
while
working
with
those
people
and
they
made
a
man
out
of
me
when
i
left
there
i
was
a
first
class
carpenter
those
white
people
was
the
cause
of
me
getting
independent
i
did
get
no
book
sense
but
if
you
get
with
some
good
white
people

will
be
worth
more
than

any
school
education
but
his
brothers

that
he

he

because
the
overseer

was
such
a
good
working
man
that
once
or
twice
the
boss
man
turned
off
his
overseer
on
account
of
him
there

blow
most
of

it
would
be
half
a
day
before
they
could
take
her
when
they
did
get
her
they
would
whip
her
so
they
would
have
to
raise
her
in
a
sheet
the
last
time
they
whipped
her
it
took
her
nearly
a
year
to
get
over
it
so
the
white
man
just
turned
her
loose
and
told
her
she
was
free
she
went
on
off
and
we
never
did
know
what
became
of
her
the
easons

a
large
plantation
i

just
how
many
slaves
they
owned
my

and
mother
were
fed
like
pigs
they
had
an
old
woman
that
did
the
cooking

would
give
the
slaves
greens
and
the
children
my
parents
were
field
hands
my
mother
was
too
young
to
carry
a
row
when
she
was
freed
but
she
worked
on
an
older
person
row
they
worked
from
can
till
ca
you
know
what
i
mean
from
the
time
they
could
see
till
the
time
they
could
reb
time
was
something
like
the
penitentiary
now
it
never
got

cold
nor

extra
on

more
my

of
a
fight

old
man
he

carrying
them
the
same
way
he
was
going
before
the
war
and
they
had
a
row
quarrel
and
left
him
i
do
know
just
what
terms
they
worked
on
i
do
think
they
did
themselves
they
took
just
what
they
could
get
and
did
know
just
how
they
was
paid
if
a
man
made
a
good
crop
they
would
run
him
away
and
make
him
leave
his
crops
behind
my
folks
continued
to
farm
all
their
lives
they
had
trouble
with
the
night
riders
they
had
to
vote
like
they
were
told
if
you
voted
the
wrong
way
they
would
get
behind
you
and
run
you
off
there
were
some
folks
who
would
take
pay
for
voting
and
then
vote
different
and
when
the
night
riders
found
it
out
there
would
be
trouble
i
do
believe
in
taking
money
for
voting
and
i
do
believe
in
lying

and
do
what
he
wanted
when

she
gave
both
of
her
children

her
age
it

around

mother

shortly
after

years

probably
a
liberal
allowance
for
the
distance
of
her

carolina
the
white
man
me
and
my
sister
worked
with
after
my
father
died
was
the
man
my
father
worked
with
in
the
juniper
swamp
his
name
was
alfred
perry
white
as
long
as
he
lived
we
could
do
work
for
him
we
did
live
on
his
place
but
we
worked
for
him
by
the
day
he
is
dead
now
died
way
back
yonder
in
the
seventies
there
was
the
brooks
and
baxter
trouble
in
and
my
father
died
in
white
lived
a
little
while
longer
my
father
was
married
twice
before
he
married
my
mother
he
had
two
sets
of
children
i
do
know
how
many
of
them
there
were
he
had
four
children
by
my
mother
he
had
only
four
children
as
far
as
i
can
remember
i
do
know
how
my
father
and
my
mother
met
up
they
lived
in
the
same
plantation
and
in
the
same
house
they
were
owned
by
the
same
man
when
freedom
came
i
do
know
how
they
got
together
i
have
often
wondered
about
that
one
from
tennessee
and
the
other
from
north
carolina
but
they
got
together
i
guess
that
they
must
have
been
born
in
different
places
and
brought
together
through
being
bought
and
sold
my
mother
was
a
murrill
my
father
was
a
cartwright
my
brother
lewis
was
a
man
who
did
take
nothing
much
from
anybody
and
he
did
like
to
take
a
whipping
when
lewis
master
wanted
to
whip
him
he
would
call
his
mother
the
master
mother
and
have
her
whip
him
because
he
figured
uncle
lewis
would
hit
a
woman
i
have
six
children
altogether
two
of
them
are
dead
there
are
three
girls
and
one
boy
living
the
oldest
is
the
next
fifty
and
the
youngest
the
youngest
is
in
the
hospital
for
nervous
and
mental
diseases
she
has
been
there
ever
since
the
oldest
had
an
arm
and
four
ribs
broken
in
an
auto
accident
last
january
on
the
sixteenth
of
the
month
she
did
get
a
penny
to
pay
for
her
trouble
i
remember
the
man
did
give
her
fifteen
cents
once
the
truck
struck
her
at
the
alley
there
and
knocked
her
clean
across
the
street
she
is
years
old
and
bones
do
knit
fast
on
people
that
old
she
ai
able
to
do
no
work
yet
all
of
my
daughters
are
out
of
work
i
do
know
where
the
boy
is
he
is
somewheres
up
north
slave
houses
i
have
seen
some
old
log
houses
that
they
said
the
slaves
used
to
live
in
i
was
too
young
to
notice
before
freedom
i
have
seen
different
specimens
of
houses
that
they
lived
in
one
log
house
had
a
plank
house
builded
on
to
the
end
of
it
the
log
end
was
the
one
lived
in
during
slavery
times
and
the
plank
end
was
built
since
that
gal
there
of
mine
was
born
in
the
log
end
there
were
round
log
houses
and
sawed
log
houses
the
sawed
log
houses
was
built
out
of
logs
that
had
been
squared
after
the
tree
had
been
cut
down
and
the
round
log
houses
was
built
out
of
logs
left
just
like
they
was
when
they
was
trees
there
been
quite
an
improvement
in
the
houses
since
i
was
a
kid
food
i
have
heard
my
father
and
mother
talking
among
themselves
and
their
friends
but
they
never
did
tell
me
nothing
about
slave
times
they
never
did
sit
down
and
talk
to
me
about
it
when
they
sit
down
and
start
talkin
it
would
always
be
you
children
run
on
out
and
play
while
we
old
folks
sit
here
and
talk
but
from
time
to
time
i
would
be
sitting
on
the
floor
playing
by
myself
and
they
would
be
talking
themselves
and
i
would
hear
them
say
this
or
that
but
i
never
heered
them
say
what
they
et
in
slave
times
work
my
father
worked
in
the
juniper
swamp
in
north
carolina
like
i
told
you
i
think
i
heard
my
mother
say
she
cooked
most
i
ever
heard
them
say
was
when
they
would
get
with
some
one
else
and
each
would
talk
about
his
master
cruelties
i
heard
my
mother
say
that
her
mistress
used
to
take
a
fork
and
stick
it
in
her
head
jog
it
up
and
down
against
her
head
i
do
know
how
hard
she
punched
her
my
mother
was
very
gray
all
her
hair
was
gray
and
she
was
old
enough
for
that
i
reckon
that
was
why
how
freedom
came
i
do
remember
how
freedom
came
they
were
refugeed
i
call
it
that
my
father
and
mother
were
my
sister
was
born
in
texas
and
they
were
back
in
arkansas
again
when
i
was
born
i
was
born
and
raised
right
here
in
arkansas
they
were
running
from
one
place
to
the
other
to
keep
the
yankees
from
freeing
the
slaves
i
never
even
heard
them
say
where
they
were
freed
i
do
know
whether
it
was
here
or
in
texas
right
after
the
war
i
have
no
knowledge
of
what
they
did
right
after
the
war
the
first
thing
i
remember
was
that
they
were
picking
cotton
in
pine
bluff
or
near
there
it
was
a
smoky
log
house
i
had
to
stay
in

were
out
in

and
the
smoke
used
to
hurt
my
eyes
awful
ku
klux
and
patrollers
i
do
remember
nothing
about
the
ku
klux
i
heard
old
folks
say
they
used
to
have
passes
to
keep
the
pateroles
from
bothering
them
i
remember
that
they
said
the
pateroles
would
whip
them
if
they
would
catch
them
out
without
a
pass
when
i
first
heard
of
the
ku

thought
that
it
was
some
kind
of
beast

did
occupational
experiences

stephens
west
street
little
rock
arkansas
age
i
was
born
right
here
in
little
rock
my
father
was
owned
by
a
splendid
family
the
ashleys
the
family
of
noah
badgett
owned
my
mother
and
the
children
pardon
me
madam
and
i
shall
explain
how
that
was
in
many
cases
the
father
of
children
born
in
slavery
could
not
be
definitely
determined
there
was
never
a
question
about
the
mother
from
this
you
will
understand
that
the
children
belonged
to
the
master
who
owned
the
mother
this
was
according
to
law
my
father
family
name
was
andrews
how
did
it
happen
that
it
was
not
ashley
oh
my
dear
you
have
been
misinformed
about
all
slaves
taking
the
name
of
the
master
who
owned
them
when
peace
came
no
madam
my
father
was
named
william
wallace
andrews
after
his
father
who
was
an
english
gentleman
he
had
come
to
missouri
in
early
days
and
owned
slaves
yes
my
grandfather
was
white
the
ashleys
brought
my
father
to
arkansas
territory
when
they
came
they
always
permitted
him
to
keep
his
family
name
many
other
masters
did
the
same
from
the
standpoint
of
understanding
between
the
white
and
colored
races
little
rock
has
always
been
a
good
place
to
live
the
better
class
families
did
not
speak
of
their
retainers
as
slaves
they
were
called
servants
both
my
parents
were
educated
by
their
masters
besides
being
a
teacher
and
minister
my
father
was
a
carpenter
and
expert
cabinet
worker
the
first
school
for
negroes
in
little
rock
was
opened
in
and
was
taught
by
my
father
i
went
to
school
to
him
a
few
months
later
there
came
from
the
north
a
company
of
missionary
teachers
and
opened
a
school
which
i
attended
until
my
father
was
a
minister
of
the
methodist
episcopal
church
for
colored
people
on
what
is
now
eighth
and
broadway
he
also
had
a
chapel
on
the
property
of
ashley
you
probably
know
that
during
slavery
days
the
slaves
belonged
to
and
attended
the
same
church
as
their
white
folks
they
sat
in
the
back
or
in
a
balcony
built
for
them
my
father
was
considered
the
founder
of
wesley
chapel
which
was
methodist
episcopal
from
that
time
until
this
day
i
have
been
a
member
of
that
church
years
i
think
it
is
before
the
break
came
in
the
methodist
church
you
know
it
was
all
the
same
north
and
south
after
the
division
on
account
of
slavery
the
methodist
church
in
the
south
had
the
word
south
attached
for
a
long
time
my
father
did
not
realize
that
in
he
and
his
church
went
back
into
the
original
methodist
church
in
the
society
of
friends
we
called
them
quakers
came
and
erected
a
large
schoolhouse
at
sixth
and
state
streets
it
was
called
union
school
when
it
was
built
it
was
said
by
the
quakers
that
it
was
to
be
for
the
use
of
colored
children
forever
but
within
a
year
or
two
the
city
bought
the
property
and
took
charge
of
the
school
as
far
as
i
can
now
recall
white
and
colored
children
never
did
attend
the
same
school
in
little
rock
there
have
always
been
separate
schools
for
the
races
i
am
able
to
remember
the
names
of
the
first
teachers
in
the
quaker
school
binford
was
the
principal
and
his
sister
taught
the
primary
department
other
teachers
were
miss
anna
wiles
or
ware
miss
louise
coffin
miss
lizzie
garrison
and
sarah
henley

came
and
was
living
with
my
mother
and
the
other
children
on
the
badgett
plantation
about
miles
east
of
little
rock
mother
did
laundry
and
general
house
work
being
a
small
child
all
that
was
asked
of
me
was
to
run
errands
and
amuse
the
little
white
children
madam
if
i
could
tell
you
the
great
difference
between
slave
owners
it
would
help
you
in
understanding
conditions
of
today
among
the
colored
people
both
my
father
and
my
mother
had
peculiar
privileges
the
ashley
family
were
exceptional
slave
owners
they
permitted
their
servants
to
hire
their
time
there
was
class
distinction
perhaps
to
greater
extent
than
among
the
white
people
yes
madam
the
slaves
who
lived
in
the
family
with
master
and
mistress
were
taught
just
about
the
same
as
their
own
children
at
any
rate
they
imitated
them
in
all
matters
to
speak
with
a
low
voice
use
good
english
the
niceties
of
manners
good
form
and
courtesy

the
emancipated
slaves
were
led
to
believe
they
would
be
given
property
and
have
just
what
their
masters
had
been
accustomed
to
enjoy
i
remember
hearing
my
mother
tell
in
later
years
that
she
really
had
expected
to
live
as
her
mistress
had
having
some
one
to
wait
upon
her
plenty
of
money
to
spend
ride
in
a
carriage
with
a
coachman
but
she
always
added
that
the
emancipated
ones
soon
found
out
that
freedom
meant
more
work
and
harder
than
they
had
ever
done
before
what
did
they
work
at
pardon
me
please
for
so
often
reminding
you
of
conditions
of
that
time
few
of
the
trades
workers
were
white
brick
makers
and
brick
layers
stone
masons
lathers
plasters
all
types
of
builders
were
of
the
freed
men
you
must
remember
that
slaves
were
the
only
ones
who
did
this
work
their
masters
had
used
their
labor
as
their
means
of
income
not
all
slaves
were
in
the
cotton
fields
as
some
suppose
the
slave
owners
of
towns
and
villages
had
their
slaves
learn
skilled
trade
occupations
and
made
a
great
deal
of
money
by
their
earnings
the
yankee
soldiers
and
the
many
northern
people
who
lived
here
hired
the
freed
men
and
paid
them
quite
soon
the
colored
people
were
buying
homes
many
were
even
hired
by
their
former
masters
and
paid
for
the
work
they
formerly
did
without
pay
under
slavery
i
remember
bill
read
and
dave
lowe
they
had
been
coachmen
before
freedom
by
combining
their
first
savings
they
bought
a
hack
as
it
was
called
it
was
more
of
a
cab
for
all
those
who
did
not
have
private
conveyances
this
was
the
only
way
of
getting
about
town
it
was
little
rock
first
business
i
should
say
bill
and
dave
made
a
fortune
they
had
a
monopoly
of
business
for
years
and
eventually
had
enough
cabs
to
take
the
entire
population
to
big
evening
parties
theater
and
all
places
where
crowds
would
gather
no
madam
i
do
not
recall
that
we
had
any
inconvenience
from
the
ku
klux
klan
if
they
made
trouble
in
little
rock
i
do
not
now
remember
it
i
did
hear
that
out
in
the
country
they
drove
people
from
their
homes
yes
madam
i
do
remember
quite
distinctly
the
times
when
colored
men
were
voted
into
public
offices
john
corbin
was
state
superintendent
of
public
instruction
phillips
county
sent
two
colored
men
to
the
legislature
they
were
gray
and
white
both
from
helena
bush
of
this
city
followed
gibbs
as
police
judge
after
reconstruction
when
all
colored
people
were
eliminated
from
public
life
all
these
people
returned
to
their
trade
i
was
when
i
married
my
husband
was
a
teacher
but
knew
the
carpenter
trade
during
the
time
that
negroes
served
in
public
office
he
served
as
deputy
sheriff
and
deputy
constable
he
was
with
me
for
years
before
his
death
we
raised
a
family
of
six
children
and
gave
each
one
a
college
education
now
you
have
asked
my
opinion
of
present
conditions
of
the
younger
generation
it
seems
to
me
they
are
living
in
an
age
of
confusion
they
seem
to
be
all
at
sea
as
to
what
they
should
get
for
themselves
i
do
know
this
in
some
respects
the
modern
frankness
is
an
improvement
over
the
old
suppression
and
repression
in
the
presence
of
their
elders
at
the
same
time
i
think
the
young
people
of
today
lack
the
proper
reverence
and
respect
for
age
and
the
experience
it
brings
as
a
guide
for
them
during
my
long
years
of
teaching
i
have
had
opportunity
to
study
this
question
i
am
still
making
a
study
of
the
many
phases
of
modern
life
as
it
affects
the
young
people
i
do
not
like
the
trend
of
amusements
of
today
i
would
like
for
our
young
people
to
become
interested
in
things
more
worth
while
in
a
higher
type
of
amusement
conditions
of
morality
and
a
lack
of
regard
for
conventions
is
deplorable
smoking
among
the
girls
has
increased
the
common
use
of
liquor
between
the
sexes
did
you
ask
me
about
the
voting
restrictions
for
the
colored
race
in
this
state
i
will
tell
you
frankly
that
i
think
the
primary
law
here
is
unjust
most
unjust
we
are
citizens
in
every
other
respect
the
primary
voting
privilege
should
be
ours
also
this
restriction
has
been
explained
as
coming
down
from
the
grandfather
clause
inserted
in
early
legislation
i
can
not
give
you
the
exact
wording
of
the
clause
but
the
substance
was
that
no
person
whose
ancestor
grandfather
was
not
entitled
to
vote
should
have
the
right
to
the
ballot
of
course
it
is
readily
seen
that
this
clause
was
written
purely
for
the
purpose
of
denying
the
vote
to
the
colored
people
perhaps
madam
my
talk
has
been
too
much
along
educational
lines
you
asked
me
about
my
life
since
freedom
came
and
how
i
have
lived
to
the
present
time
i
have
had
the
blessed
privilege
of
being
a
teacher
of
doing
the
work
i
love
best
of
all
in
the
world
to
do
i
have
written
the
story
of
my
life
work
it
is
all
ready
to
be
published
i
have
written
the
story
of
negro
schools
in
little
rock
and
memoirs
of
little
rock
madam
i
have
written
i
suppose
what
would
amount
to
volumes
for
our
church
papers
and
local
negro
newspaper
my
daughter
was
at
one
time
editor
of
the
womens
page
no
i
indeed
sorry
that
i
have
not
kept
a
scrapbook
of
such
writings
in
these
latter
years
my
friends
scold
me
for
having
destroyed
all
the
papers
as
fast
as
they
were
read
the
most
of
the
news
in
the
articles
however
i
have
used
in
the
manuscripts
of
the
books
i
hope
to
have
published

his

he
had
a

were
frame
or
brick
houses
there
were
any
log
houses
where
i
was
brought
up
georgia
was
a
log
house
state
leastwise
not
the
part
i
lived
in
in
another
part
there
were
plenty
of
sawmills
that
made
lumber
common
you
could
get
longleaf
pine
eighty
to
ninety
feet
long
if
you
wanted
it
some
little
towns
did
have
no
planing
mills
and
you
would
have
to
send
to
augusta
or
to
atlanta
for
the
planing
work
or
else
they
would
make
planed
lumber
by
hand
i
have
worked

four
and
five
weeks
at
a
time
dressing
lumber
flooring
ceiling
siding
moldings
and
so
on
my
father
was
still
with
simpson
when
i
remembered
anything
at
that
time
the
house
we
lived
in
was
a
weatherboarded
house
just
like
the
ones
we
live
in
now
it
was
a
house
that
had
been
built
since
freedom
old
man
simpson
sent
for
my
father
and
told
him
to
build
a
house
for
himself
on
the
grounds
my
father
had
been
with
simpson
for
so
long
and
had
done
so
much
work
for
him
during
slave
time
that
simpson
did
want
to
do
without
him
he
supplied
all
the
lumber
and
materials
for
my
father
during
slave
time
simpson
had
hired
my
father
out
to
the
other
planters
when
he
had
nothing
for
him
to
do
in
the
line
of
building
on
his
own
plantation
he
had
had
him
to
superintend
his
grist
mill
all
that
was
in
slavery
time
my
father
was
a
highly
skilled
laborer
he
could
do
a
lot
of
other
things
besides
building
so
when
freedom
came
he
wanted
my
father
him
still
they
both
fished
and
hunted
he
wanted
my
father
to
go
fishing
with
him
and
keep
him
company
my
father
was
a
carpenter
of
the
first
class
you
see
even
in
slave
time
that
was
all
he
done
he
was
brought
up
to
be
a
carpenter
and
did
nothing
but
that
all
his
time
my
daddy
was
a
mighty
good
mechanic
good
master
my
daddy
master
was
a
very
good
and
kind
one
my
father
was
not
under
any
overseer
he
worked
directly
under
his
master
i
remember
one
incident
he
told
me
his
master
hired
a
new
overseer
who
hung
around
for
a
bit
watching
my
father
finally
my
father
asked
him
what
are
you
able
to
do
the
overseer
answered
i
can
see
all
over
and
whip
all
over
and
that
as
much
as
any
damn
man
can
do
nobody
was
allowed
to
touch
my
father
he
never
had
no
trouble
with
the
pateroles
either
old
man
simpson
did
allow
that
he
was
a
free
agent
when
he
was

got
wages
for
his
work
sometimes
he
worked
a
contract
old
man
simpson
could
afford
to
have
him
handicapped
in
his
going
and
coming
he
could
go
whenever
he
wanted
to
go
and
come
back
whenever
he
got
ready
with
a
pass
or
without
one
his
time
was
valuable
the
reason
why
so
many
slaves
suffered
as
much
as
they
did
as
a
rule
was
not
because
of
the
masters
but
because
of
the
poor
white
trash
overseers
i
know
of
several
rich
white
women
that
had
slaves
that
would
allow
them
to
be
mistreated
they
would
fire
four
and
five
overseers
to
keep
their
slaves
from
being
mistreated
mean
masters
but
there
were
some
mean
masters
i
have
heard
that
right
there
in
georgia
there
was
one
white
planter
i
think
it
was
brantley
put
one
of
his
slaves
that
had
been
unruly
in
a
packing
screw
and
ran
it
down
on
him
till
he
mashed
him
to
death
the
cotton
screw
was
the
thing
they
pressed
cotton
bales
in
they
run
it
down
by
steam
now
but
then
they
used
to
run
it
down
with
two
mules
they
tell
a
lot
of
things
like
that
on
brantley
of
course
i
could
personally
know
it
but
i
know
he
was
mighty
mean
and
i
know
the
way
he
died
bushwhacking
the
ku
klux
he
belonged
to
the
paterole
gang
and
they
went
out
after
the
negroes
one
night
after
freedom
the
negroes
bushwhacked
them
and
killed
four
or
five
of
them
they
give
it
out
that
the
men
that
was
killed
had
gone
to
texas
brantley
was
one
of
the
killed
ones
the
pateroles
was
awful
bad
at
that
time
ku
klux
they
called
them
after
the
war
but
they
was
the
same
people
i
never
heard
of
the
klan
part
till
this
thing
come
up
that
they
have
now
they
called
them
ku
klux
back
when
i
was
a
boy
my
stepmother
carried
me
over
to
brantley
house
the
night
he
got
killed
so
i
know
the
texas
he
went
to
that
was
in
or
he
lived
about
a
mile
from
us
and
when
he
got
killed
she
carried
me
over
to
see
him
just
like
we
would
have
gone
to
see
any
other
neighbor
the
negroes
were
naturally
afraid
of
the
ku
klux
but
they
finally
got
to
the
place
where
they
were
determined
to
break
it
up
they
did
have
no
ropes
but
they
would
take
grapevines
and
tie
them
across
the
road
about
breast
high
when
a
man
would
be
on
horseback
the
ku
klux
would
run
against
these
vines
and
be
knocked
off
their
horses
into
the
road
and
then
the
bushwhackers
would
shoot
them
when
ku
klux
was
killed
in
this
manner
it
was
never
admitted
but
it
was
said
that
they
had
gone
to
texas
there
was
several
of
them
went
to
texas
one
night
amusements
there
were
many
amusements
in
slave
times
they
had
dances
with
fiddle
music
there
was
mighty
few
darkies
could
get
out
to
go
to
dances
because
the
pateroles
was
so
bad
after
them
i
do
know
of
any
other
amusements
the
slaves
had
they
were
playing
baseball
when
i
was
born
there
were
boys
much
older
than
i
was
already
playing
when
i
was
old
enough
to
notice
so
i
think
they
must
have
known
about
it
in
slave
time
they
did
play
much
in
that
way
because
they
did
have
time
slaves
who
bought
themselves
i
have
heard
tell
of
some
negroes
that
was
thrifty
and
got
money
enough
from
side
work
to
buy
themselves
they
had
to
go
north
then
because
they
could
live
in
the
south
free
i
do
remember
their
names
just
now
church
the
slaves
had
church
sometimes
they
had
church
at
one
house
i
do
think
they
ever
built
them
a
church
house
but
they
could
go
to
the
white
folks
church
if
they
wanted
to
how
freedom
came
my
daddy
master
told
my
father
he
was
free
he
told
him
that
in
he
told
him
that
he
was
free
to
do
as
he
pleased
that
he
could
come
when
he
pleased
and
go
when
he
pleased
he
told
him
he
wanted
him
to
stay
around
him
not
to
go
off
soldiers
i
have
heard
my
father
speak
of
soldiers
but
they
were
too
busy
atlanta
and
up
that
way
to
git
down
where
my
father
was
they
do
seem
to
have
bothered
his
town
they
never
made
my
father
do
any
labor
in
the
army
neither
my
father
was
mixed
indian
white
and
negro
marriage
slaves
had
to
get
the
consent
of
their
masters
to
marry
sometimes
masters
would
want
them
to
go
and
would
even
buy
the
woman
they
wanted
to
keep
them
contented
on
the
plantation
sometimes
the
masters
do
anything
but
let
them
visit
they
would
marry
what
they
called
marriage
in
those
days
and
the
husband
would
have
to
git
permission
from
his
master
to
go
visit
his
wife
and
git
permission
from
her
master
to
come
there
he
would
go
on
saturday
night
and
get
back
in
time
for
his
work
on
monday
morning
it
was
just
like
raising
stock
and
mating
it
i
have
been
married
years
i
have
been
married
twice
though
my
first
wife
died
in
i
have
been
married
to
my
second
wife
years
last
april
those
were
real
marriages
opinions
i
ca
say
much
along
these
lines
the
chance
to
make
a
living
looks
so
dark
i
ca
see
much
of
a
future
things
seem
to
be
getting
worse
nearly
everybody
i
talk
with
white
or
colored
seems
to
think
the
same
it
is
like
senator
glass
said
congress
would
close
up
and
go
home
at
once
times
would
get
better
people
do
know
what
kind
of
fool
law
congress
is
going
to
make
and
they
are
not
going
to
spend
much
money
i
do
think
roosevelt
pump
priming
will
do
much
good
because
you
must
keep
adding
to
it
or
it
will
go
away
i
do
think
much
of
the
young
people
these
nineteenth
or
twentieth
century
negroes
is
something
fierce
i
telling
you
vocational
experiences
i
am
a
carpenter
i
wish
i
was
the
depression
has
made
it
so
that
the
negroes
get
very
little
to
do
what
they
have
they
give
to
their
own
people
they
do
have
much
for
nobody
even
if
the
nigger
gets
something
he
gets
very
little
out
of
it
but
the
main
trouble
is
there
is
anything
to
do
i
have
been
a
carpenter
for
years
i
have
been
here
years
i
have
never
had
no
trouble
earning
a
living
till
now
i
ca
do
it
now
the
biggest
obstacle
of
the
success
of
the
negro
carpenter
is
that
negroes
do
have
the
money
to
build
with
they
must
get
the
money
from
the
white
man
the
white
man
on
the
other
hand
if
he
lets
out
the
money
for
the
building
has
the
on
who
will
do
it
and
he
naturally
picks
out
another
white
man
that
keeps
the
majority
of
negroes
out
of
work
as
far
as
carpentry
is
concerned
it
does
in
a
time
like
this
when
times
is
better
the
white
man
does
not
need
to
be
so
tight
and
he
can
divide

made
them
bring
them
a
chunk
of
fire
they
throwed
the
fire
on
the
bed
and
when
it
got
to
burning
good
the

it
out
but
he
told
them
that
they
could
get
some
of
the
boys
to
help
them
carry
out
their
things
if
the
boys
were
willing
to
do
it
it
was
the
officers
who
wanted
the
women
to

the
house
that

in
slavery
times
the
speculators
who
were
buying

but
it
all
belonged
to
one
person
the
name
of
the
place
was
cloverdale

my

give
him
turns
of
corn
you

to
the
mill
you
would
carry
about
two
bushels
of
corn
and
call
it
a
milling
or
a
turn
my
father
would
let
his
young
master
shell
a
bushel
or
two
of
corn
and
carry
it
to
the
mill
he
got
poor
and

hard
luck

whether
it
was
the
agent
or
the
owner
or
who
but
they
were
whipped
lots
of
times
they
had
work
to
do
and
did
do
it
naturally
they
whipped
them
for
it
that
was
what
they
whipped
my
grandparents
for
sometimes
too
they
would
go
off
and
would
let
the
white
folks
know
where
they
was
going
sometimes
they
would
neglect
to
feed
the
horses
or
to
milk
the
cows
something
like
that
that
was
the
only
reason
i
ever
heard
of
for
punishing
them
i
heard
that
if
the
boss
man
wanted
to
be
with
women
that
they
had
the
women
would
be
scared
not
to
be
with
him
for
fear
he
would
whip
them
and
when
they
started
whipping
them
for
that
they
kept
on
till
they
got
what
they
wanted
they
would
take
them
off
and
have
dealings
with
them
that
is
where
so
much
of
that
yellow
and
comes
from
there
was
some
one
going
through
telling
the
people
that
they
was
free
and
that
they
was
their
own
boss
but
yet
and
still
there
lots
of
them
never
did
leave
the
man
they
was
with
and
lots
of
them
left
there
was
lots
of
white
people
that
would
let
a
nigger
tell
their
niggers
that
they
was
free
because
they
wanted
to
keep
them
blind
to
that
for
years
kept
them
for
three
or
four
years
anyway
them
that
bullocks
liked
was
crazy
about
him
he
would
give
them
a
show
so
much
a
month
and
their
keeps
i
do
remember
exactly
how
much
it
was
but
it
was
neighborhood
price
he
was
a
pretty
good
man
of
course
you
never
seen
a
white
man
that
would
cheat
a
little
he
cheat
you
out
of
a
little
cotton
he
would
have
the
cotton
carried
to
the
gin
he
would
take
half
the
corn
and
give
us
five
or
six
shoats
after
he
got
the
cotton
all
picked
and
sold
the
cotton
it
would
all
go
to
him
for
what
you
owed
him
for
furnishing
you
you
never
saw
how
much
cotton
was
ginned
nor
how
much
he
got
for
it
nor
how
much
it
was
worth
nor
nothing
they
would
just
tell
you
you
was
due
nothing
they
did
that
to
hold
you
for
another
year
you
got
nothing
to
move
on
so
you
stay
there
and
take
what
he
gives
you
of
all
the
crying
you
ever
heard
one
morning
we
got
up
and
the
pigs
and
hogs
in
the
lot
that
we
had
fattened
to
go
on
that
winter
he
was
catching
them
after
we
done
fattened
them
with
the
corn
that
was
our
share
he
took
and
sold
we
did
even
know
we
owed
him
anything
we
thought
the
crops
had
done
settled
things
nobody
told
us
nothin
all
we
children
cried
the
old
man
and
the
old
woman
did
say
nothing
because
they
was
scared
my
mother
would
get
up
and
go
down
and
milk
the
cows
and
what
she
get
for
the
milking
would
maybe
be
a
bucket
of
buttermilk
we
have
a
spoonful
of
black
molasses
and
corn
bread
and
buttermilk
for
breakfast
we
got
flour
bread
once
a
week
we
would
work
hard
all
the
week
talkin
what
good
biscuits
we
have
sunday
morning
sack
of
flour
would
last
two
or
three
months
because
we
would
cook
flour
bread
only
once
a
week
saturday
night
or
sunday
morning
we
had
no
skillet
at
that
time
we
would
rake
the
fireplace
and
push
the
ashes
back
and
then
you
would
put
the
cake
down
on
the
hearth
or
on
a
piece
of
paper
or
a
leaf
and
then
pull
the
ashes
over
the
cake
to
cook
it
just
like
you
roast
a
sweet
potato
then
when
it
got
done
you
would
rake
the
ashes
back
and
wash
the
cake
and
you
would
eat
it
sometimes
you
would
strike
a
little
grit
or
gravel
in
it
and
break
your
teeth
but
then
i
tellin
you
the
truth
about
it
when
our
hogs
was
taken
that
time
we
did
have
nothing
to
go
on
that
winter
they
would
compel
us
to
stay
they
would
allowance
us
some
meat
and
make
us
split
rails
and
clear
up
land
for
it
it
was
a
cinch
if
he
did
give
it
to
you
you
could
get
nothin
was
no
way
to
get
nothing
then
when
crop
time
rolled
again
they
would
take
it
all
out
of
your
crops
make
you
split
rails
and
wood
to
earn
your
meat
and
then
charge
it
up
to
your
crop
anyhow
but
you
could
do
nothin
it
sometimes
a
barrel
of
molasses
would
set
up
in
the
smokehouse
and
turn
to
sugar
you
goin
hungry
and
molasses
wastin
they
was
determined
not
to
give
you
too
much
of
it
i
made
my
way
by
farming
after
i
got
to
be
some
size
i
started
at
it
i
farmed
all
my
life
while
i
could
work
things
was
pretty
good
wisht
i
was
on
a
farm
now
even
when
i
here
sick
i
can
git
these
potatoes
raised
with
a
little
help
from
the
neighbors
i
do
belong
to
church
i
oughter
but
i
do
then
again
i
figure
that
a
man
can
be
just
as
good
out
of
it
as
he
can
in
it
i
got
good
desires
but
i
never
confessed
to
the
public
i
have
had
three
hundred
dollars
worth
of
stuff
stolen
from
me
everything
i
produced
is
stolen
from
me
because
i
have
no
way
to
protect
myself
what
i
raise
if
i
do
get
shet
of
it
right
away
the
people
get
shet
of
it
for
me
i
had
eighty
head
of
chickens
in
the
barn
out
there
runnin
when
i
got
sick
and
was
in
the
bed
and
help
myself
the
chickens
went
in
the
daytime
they
would
fix
traps
and
jerk
a
string
and
pull
a
board
down
on
them
and
then
go
out
in
the
weeds
and
get
them
i
never
reported
nothin
to
the
police
i
was
able
to
report
nothing
i
was
just
batching
and
now
and
then
people
would
come
in
and
report
them
to
me
they
would
wait
till
they
saw
somebody
come
in
and
when
they
saw
that
i
was
talking
and
would
notice
them
they
would
steal
anything
they
wanted
the
police
came
by
here
and
ran
them
once
but
that
did
do
no
good
once
somebody
stole
an
automatic
shotgun
they
stole
a
colt
one
time
they
stole
all
my
clothes
and
pawned
them
to
a
whiskey
dealer
he
got
sent
to
the
pen
for
selling
whiskey
but
i
did
get
my
clothes
they
come
in
the
yard
and
steal
my
potatoes
collards
turnips
ochre
okra
and
so
on
i
lay
there
in
the
bed
and
see
them
but
i
stop
them
all
i
can
do
is
to
holler

interviewer
comment
hw
omit
the
spelling
of
the
name
sunnaville
is
phonetic
i
do
recognize
the
name
and
he
could
spell
it
of
course
when
i
called
he
had
potatoes
that
weighed
at
least
seven
pounds
they
were
laid
out
on
the
porch
for
sale
he
had
a
small
patch
in
his
yard
which
he
cultivated
and
had
gotten
about
ten
bushels
from
it
his
account
of
slavery
times
is
so
vivid
that
you
would
consider
his
age
nearer
eighty
than
a
little
questioning
reveals
that
he
has
no
idea
of
his
age
although
he
readily
gives
it
as
a
memorized

arkansas
age
my
people
are
all
from
richmond
virginia
i
was
just
four
years
old
when
they
come
here
my
father
was
in
charge
of
all
the
machinery
he
ran
the
gin
did
do
anything
else
my
mother
was
a
house
girl
the
kids
learned
her
everything
they
learned
in
school
she
knew
everything
my
father
died
when
i
was
young
my
mother
lived
till
she
was
eighty
but
the
time
she
was
fifty
i
bought
her
a
home
and
sat
her
down
on
pulaski
street
in
that
home
and
that
is
why
i
have
so
little
trouble
my
ma
belonged
to
hoffman
he
sold
her
to
wiley
adams
he
carried
her
to
mississippi
she
stayed
there
for
a
short
time
and
then
came
to
arkansas
he
settled
in
a
little
place
called
tulip
arkansas
then
freedom
came
and
we
came
to
little
rock
and
settled
at
what
is
now
seventh
and
ringo
streets
but
then
it
was
just
a
stage
road
leading
to
benton
arkadelphia
and
other
places
stages
passed
twice
a
day
with
passengers
and
freight
no
railroads
at
all
then
the
government
kept
the
roads
up
they
had
the
arsenal
hall
where
the
city
park
is
and
had
a
regiment
of
soldiers
there
the
work
on
that
road
was
kept
up
by
the
soldiers
that
was
under
grant
administration
i
never
saw
but
three
presidents
three
democratic
presidents
cleveland
wilson
and
roosevelt
my
father
master
was
named
lee
he
married
my
mother
back
in
virginia
my
daddy
people
when
he
was
freed
was
named
taylor
he
died
when
i
was
young
and
he
never
gave
me
any
details
about
them
good
masters
the
adamses
were
good
to
my
mother
and
they
help
her
even
after
freedom
charlie
adams
and
mack
adams
of
malvern
arkansas
john
was
the
sheriff
and
ran
a
store
mack
was
a
drummer
for
the
penzl
grocery
when
my
mother
was
ill
he
used
to
bring
her
thirty
dollars
at
a
time
every
two
months
she
had
to
go
down
to
malvern
when
she
was
well
and
carry
an
empty
trunk
and
when
she
would
come
back
it
would
be
full
my
mother
was
to
the
adamses
and
they
thought
the
world
and
all
of
her
marriage
they
had
a
good
opinion
of
their
house
servants
that
is
how
she
and
my
father
came
to
belong
to
different
families
one
white
man
would
say
to
the
other
got
a
good
boy
i
going
to
let
him
come
over
to
see
your
girl
he
would
be
talking
about
a
negro
man
that
worked
around
his
house
and
a
negro
girl
that
worked
for
the
other
man
that
would
be
all
right
so
that
the
way
my
father
went
to
see
my
mother
he
was
married
in
the
way
they
always
married
in
those
days
you
know
how
it
was
there
was
no
marriage
at
all
they
just
went
on
out
and
got
the
woman
and
the
white
man
said
she
is
you
are
man
and
wife
right
after
the
war
my
father
died
before
freedom
my
mother
lived
with
him
until
her
folks
moved
away
from
his
folks
then
she
was
separated
from
him
and
left
him
in
mississippi
she
belonged
to
one
white
man
and
he
to
another
and
that
could
happen
any
time
right
after
freedom
she
stayed
with
these
white
people
doing
the
house
work
she
had
the
privilege
of
raising
things
for
herself
she
made
a
garden
and
raised
vegetables
and
such
like
my
brother
who
had
run
off
during
slavery
time
and
who
later
became
a
preacher
in
the
north
invited
us
to
live
in
the
city

vocational
experiences

pacific
they
beautified
everything
there
was
any
bridge
they
had
a
boat
to
take
you
into
the
town
of
argenta
then
and
when
the
trains
came
through
the
same
boat
would
carry
the
cars
across
an
engine
would
be
on
the
other
side

when

but
they
had
him
pull
the
first

that
was
something
they

allow
the
slaves
to
handle
i
must
have
been
four
or
five
years
old
when
my
mother
was
in

train
track
they
had
a
wooden
gun
and

went
in
there
and
robbed
that
train
with
it
they
sent
him
to
the
pen
and
he
learned
a
trade
making
cigars
the
union
station
was
just
like
that
hillside
it
was
just
one
street
in
the
town
i
do
know
what
year
nor
nothing
about
it
because
when
i
came
here
it
was
just
like
somebody
did
have
any
sense
plantation
the
slave
quarter
was
a
row
of
houses
the
plantation
was
high
land
the
houses
were
little
log
houses
with
one
room
they
had
fire
arches
they
would
hang
pots
over
the
fire
they
would
have
spiders
that
you
call
ovens
you
would
put
coals
on
top
of
the
spider
and
you
would
put
them
under
it
and
you
could
smell
that
stuff
cooking
the
door
was
in
the
top
of
the
spider
and
the
coals
would
be
on
top
of
the
door
you
could
cook
nothin
then
without
somebody
knowin
it
cook
and
eat
in
the
back
while
folk
sit
in
the
front
without
them
knowin
it
they
used
to
steal
from
the
old
master
and
cook
it
and
they
would
be
burning
rags
or
something
to
keep
the
white
folks
from
smelling
it
the
riding
boss
would
come
round
about
nine
to
see
if
you
had
gone
to
bed
or
not
if
they
could
steal
a
chicken
or
pig
and
kill
and
cut
it
up
this
one
would
take
a
piece
and
that
one
would
take
a
piece
and
they
would
burn
the
cotton
to
keep
down
the
scent
the
rider
would
come
round
in
june
and
july
too
when
they
thought
the
people
would
be
hunting
the
watermelons
when
the
soldiers
came
the
niggers
run
and
hid
under
the
beds
and
the
soldiers
came
and
poked
their
bayonets
under
the
bed
and
shouted
on
out
from
under
there
you
free
destructiveness
of
soldiers
the
soldiers
would
tear
down
the
beehives
and
break
up
the
smoke
houses
they
was
tryin
to
git
nothin
to
eat
they
was
just
destroying
things
for
devilment
they
pulled
all
the
stoppers
out
of
the
molasses
they
cut
the
smoked
meat
down
and
let
it
fall
in
the
molasses
rations
every
saturday
they
would
give
my
father
and
his
wife
half
a
gallon
of
molasses
so
much
side
meat
and
then
they
would
give
half
a
bushel
of
meal
i
reckon
whatever
they
would
give
they
would
give
right
out
of
the
smoke
house
sweet
potatoes
they
would
give
sugar
and
coffee
make
there
was
nothing
buying
no
sugar
then
how
the
day
went
the
riding
boss
would
come
round
before
the
day
broke
and
wake
you
up
you
had
to
be
in
the
field
before
that
is
the
man
would
the
woman
who
had
a
little
child
had
a
little
more
play
than
the
man
because
she
had
to
care
for
the
child
before
she
left
she
had
to
carry
the
child
over
to
the
old
lady
that
took
care
of
the
babies
the
cook
that
cooked
up
to
the
big
house
she
cooked
bread
and
milk
and
sent
it
to
the
larger
children
for
their
dinner
they
did
feed
the
little
children
because
their
mothers
had
to
nurse
them
the
mother
went
to
the
field
as
soon
as
she
cared
for
her
child
she
would
come
back
and
nurse
the
child
around
about
twice
she
would
come
once
in
the
morning
about
ten
and
once
again
at
twelve
before
she
ate
her
own
lunch
she
and
her
husband
ate
their
dinner
in
the
field
she
would
come
back
again
about
three
then
you
would
see
her
any
more
till
dark
that
night
long
as
you
could
see
you
had
to
stay
in
the
field
they
did
come
home
till
sundown
then
the
mother
would
go
and
get
the
children
and
bring
them
home
she
would
cook
for
supper
and
feed
them
she
have
to
go
somewheres
and
get
them
maybe
the
children
would
be
asleep
before
she
would
get
all
that
done
then
she
would
have
to
wake
them
up
and
feed
them
i
remember
one
time
my
sister
and
me
were
laying
near
the
fire
asleep
and
my
sister
kicked
the
pot
over
and
burned
me
from
my

interviewer
comments
the
old
lady
sat
with
her
eyes
nearly
closed
while
i
questioned
her
and
listened
to
her
story
those
eyes
ran
and
looked
as
though
they
needed
attention
badly
the
interview
was
conducted
entirely
on
the
porch
as
that
of
annie
parks
traffic
interrupted
friends
interrupted
and
a
daughter
interrupted
from
time
to
time
but
this
daughter
while
a
little
suspicious
was
in
no
degree
hostile
the
two
of
them
referred
me
to
tims
who
they
said
knew
a
lot
about
slavery
his
story
is
given
along
with
this
one
i
got
the
impression
that
the
old
lady
was
born
before
the
war
but
i
accepted
her
statement
and
put
her
down
as
born
since
the
war
and
guessed
her
age
as
near
seventy
she
was
evidently
quite
reserved
about
some
details
her
father
marriage
to
her
mother
after
the
war
would
not
necessarily
mean
that
he
was
not
married
to
her
slave
fashion
before
the
war
she
did
care
so
much
about
giving
any
story
but
she
was
polite
and
obliging
after
she
had
satisfied
herself
as
to
my
identity

with
the
yankees
my
mother
used
to
tell
how
they
took
all
the
old
master
stuff
mules
and
sugar
and
then
throwed
it
out
and
rode
their
horses
through
it
when
they
did
want
it
for
theirselves
i
married
a
second
time
i
have
been
single
now
for
the
last
three
years
my
husband
died
on
the
twentieth
of
august
three
years
ago
i
ai
got
no
business
here
at
all
i
ought
to
be
at
my
home
living
well
but
i
work
for
what
i
get
and
i
proud
of
it
a
working
woman
has
many
things
to
contend
with
that
girl
downstairs
keeps
a
gang
of
men
coming
and
going
and
sometimes
some
of
them
sometimes
try
to
come
up
here
sunday
night
when
i
come
home
from
church
one
was
standing
in
the
dark
by
my
door
waiting
for
me
i
had
this
stick
in
my
hand
and
i
ordered
him
down
he
saw
i
meant
business
so
he
went
on
down
some
of
them
are
determined
there
no
hope
for
tomorrow
so
far
as
these
young
folks
are
concerned
and
the
majority
of
the
old
people
are
almost
worse
than
the
young
ones
used
to
be
that
all
the
old
people
were
mothers
and
fathers
but
now
they
are
all
going
together
everything
is
in
a
critical
condition
there
is
not
much
truth
in
the
land
all
human
affection
is
gone
there
is
mighty
little
respect
the
way
some
people
carry
on
is
pitiful
interviewer
comment
the
men
who
bother
omelia
thomas
probably
take
her
for
a
young
woman
she
has
a
gray
hair
in
her
head
and
her
skin
is
smooth
and
must
be
well
kept
she
looks
at
least
years
younger
than
she
is
and
but
for
the
accident
of
her
presence
at
another
interview
i
would
never
have
dreamed
that
she
had
a
story
to
tell
i
went
to
see
her
in
the
quarters
where
she
lives
over
the
garage
in
the
back
yard
of

white
people
she
works
for
when
i
got
halfway
up
the
stairs
she
shouted
you
ca
come
up
here
i
paused
in
perplexity
for
a
moment
and
she
stuck
her
head
out
the
door
and
looked
then
she
said
oh
i
beg
pardon
i
thought
you
were
one
of
those
men
that
visit
downstairs
i
had
noticed
the
young
lady
below
as

she
is
evidently
a
hot
number
and
as
troublesome
as
a
sore
thumb

the
good

people
who
would
steal

boy
he
saw
the
jayhawkers
coming
once

way
my
young
master
crawled
out
and
went
back
to
the

in

time
they

let
you
have
no
books
my
brother
though
was
a
good
reader
he
could
write
as
well
as
any
of
them
because
he
would
be
with
the
white
children
and
they
would
show
him
that
is
the
way
my
brother
learnt
he
would
lay
down
all
day
sunday
and
study
the
good
blessed
lord
helped
him
marriage
the
man
i
married
was
on
the
plantation
they
married
in
slave
time
just
like
they
do
these
days
when
i
married
the
justice
of
peace
married
me
that
was
after
freedom
our
folks
would
give
big
weddings
just
like
they

now
just
after
the
war
i
ai
got
my
license
now
movin
it
got
lost
i
was
married
right
at
home
where
me

my
old
man
stayed
was
nobody
there
but
me
and
him
and
another
man
named
bryant
that
was
far
from
midway
i
ca
talk
much
since
i
had
those
strokes
ca
talk
plain
just
have
to
push
it
out
but
i
thank
god
i
can
do
that
much
the
lord
let
me
stay
here
for
some
reason
i
do
know
what
i
would
rather
go
but
he
ai
called
me
how
the
day
went
we
got
up
after
daylight
tom
eford
did
make
his
folks
git
up
early
but
after
he
was
dead
and
gone
things
changed
up
the
res
made
git
up
before
daylight
he
was
a
good
man
the
lord
knows
yes
lord
way
before
day
you
be
in
the
field
to
work
way
before
day
and
then
work
way
into
the
night
the
white
folks
called
eford
colored
people
poor
white
folks
because
he
was
so
good
to
them
old
tom
eford
was
the
sheriff
of
clayton
his
folks
came
back
to
the
house
at
noon
and
et
their
dinner
at
the
house
he
had
a
cook
and
dinner
was
prepared
for
them
just
like
it
was
for
the
white
folks
the
colored
woman
that
cooked
for
them
had
it
ready
when
they
came
there
for
it
they
had
a
great
big
kitchen
and
the
hands
ate
there
they
came
back
to
the
same
place
for
supper
and
they
have
to
work
late
either
old
tom
eford
never
worked
his
hands
extra
that
is
the
reason
they
called
his
niggers
folks
folks
lived
at
home
them
days
and
et
in
the
same
place
when
my
old
man
was
living
i
had
plenty
smokehouse
was
full
of
good
meat
now
everything
you
git
you
have
to
buy
next
morning
they
all
et
their
breakfast
in
the
same
kitchen
they
et
three
meals
a
day
every
day
my
mother
never
cooked
except
on
sunday
she
did
need
to
patrollers
me
and
old
lady
eford
would
be
out
in
the
yard
and
i
would
hear
her
cuss
the
pateroles
because
they
did
want
folks
to
their
niggers
they
had
to
git
a
pass
from
their
masters
when
they
would
be
out
if
they
did
have
a
pass
the
pateroles
would
whip
them
jayhawkers
the
jayhawkers
would
catch
folks
and
carry
them
out
in
the
woods
and
hang
them
up
they
catch
you
and
beat
you
to
death
runaways
colored
folks
what
would
run
away
old
lady
eford
would
call
them
and
bones
we
would
hear
the
hounds
baying
after
them
and
old
lady
eford
would
stand
out
in
the
yard
and
cuss
them
cuss
the
hounds
i
mean
like
that
would
do
any
good
some
slaves
would
kill
theirselves
before
they
would
be
caught
they
would
hear
them
dogs
i
have
seen
old
tom
eford
he
would
have
them
dogs
he
was
sheriff
and
he
had
to
do
it
he
carried
them
dogs
he
would
be
gone
two
weeks
before
he
would
be
back
sometimes
alden
or
alton
was
the
place
they
said
they
carried
the
runaways
slave
breeding
they
never
kept
no
slaves
for
breeding
on
any
plantation
i
heard
of
they
would
work
them
to
death
and
breed
them
too
there
was
places
where
old
massa
kept
one
for
hisself
amusements
folks
had
heap
more
pleasure
than
they
do
now
in
slave
time
they
had
parties
and
dances
and
they
would
bow
they
had
fiddles
and
danced
by
them
folks
danced
them
days
they
do
dance
now
just
mess
around
my
brother
could
scrape
the
fiddle
and
dance
on
all
at
the
same
time
folks
would
give
big
suppers
and
ask
people
out
they
would
feed
nice
times
with
one
another
folks
ai
got
no
love
in
their
hearts
like
they
used
to
have
folks
would
give
quiltings
they
do
think
about
quilting
now
they
would
quilt
out
a
quilt
and
dance
the
rest
of
the
night
they
would
have
a
big
supper
at
the
quilting
nice
time
too
they
would
kill
a
hog
and
barbecue
it
they
would
cook
chicken
have
plenty
of
whiskey
too
some
folks
would
get
drunk
that
was
whiskey
them
days
they
ai
got
no
whiskey
now
old
poison
stuff
that
will
kill
people
my
daddy
was
jus
drunk
all
the
time
he
had
plenty
of
whiskey
that
was
what
killed
old
tom
eford
he
kept
it
settin
on
the
dresser
all
the
time
you
could
walk
in
his
house
but
what
you
would
see
it
time
you
got
in
folks
hide
it
now
i
have
drunk
a
many
a
glass
of
it
i
would
go
and
take
a
glass
whenever
i
wanted
to
how
freedom
came
the
old
white
folks
told
me
i
was
free
they
had
me
hired
out
i
staying
with
my
owner
there
was
nobody
there
with
me
but
the
white
folks
where
i
was
staying
that
morning
i
got
up
to
get
breakfast
and
there
was
no
fire
and
there
was
so
matches
i
went
to
some
neighbors
to
get
a
chunk
of
fire
and
they
told
me
to
go
back
to
my
folks
because
i
was
free
when
i
got
back
to
the
house
they
was
mad
and
wanted
to
whip
me
so
i
just
put
the
fire
down
and
never
cooked
no
breakfast
but
jus
went
on
to
my
brother
the
reason
they
wanted
to
whip
me
was
because
i
had
gone
outside
of
the
house
without
their
knowing
it
when
i
went
to
my
brother
i
had
to
walk
twelve
miles
my
brother
carried
me
to
my
mother
and
father
and
then
he
took
me
back
to
old
lady
eford
and
she
told
me
to
go
on
to
my
mother
that
i
was
free
now
so
he
took
me
on
back
to
my
ma
and
pa
he
said
he
do
that
so
that
i
could
stay
with
them
slave
earnings
slaves
had
money
in
slave
time
my
daddy
bought
a
horse
he
made
a
crop
every
year
he
made
his
bale
of
cotton
he
made
corn
to
feed
his
horse
with
he
belonged
to
his
white
folks
but
he
had
his
house
and
lot
right
next
to
theirs
they
would
give
him
time
you
know
he
did
have
to
work
in
the
heat
of
the
day
he
made
his
crop
and
bought
his
whiskey
the
white
folks
fed
he
had
no
expenses
tending
to
his
crop
he
did
have
to
give
tom
eford
anything
he
made
he
just
worked
his
crop
in
his
extra
time
many
folks
too
lazy
to
git
theirselves
when
they
have
the
chance
to
do
it
but
my
daddy
was
that
kind
his
old
master
gave
him
the
ground
and
he
made
it
give
him
the
money
my
daddy
left
me
plenty
but
i
ai
got
it
now
i
did
care
what
happened
when
he
died
people
made
out
like
they
was
goin
to
put
my
money
in
the
bank
for
me
and
took
it
and
destroyed
it
used
it
for
theirselves
i
reckon
now
i
need
it
and
ai
got
it
ai
got
a
penny
for
five
or
six
years
at
my
home
i
made
good
crops
we
raised
everything
we
needed
at
home
did
know
what
it
was
to
come
to
town
to
buy
anything
if
anybody
had
told
me
twenty
years
ago
i
would
be
in
this
shape
i
would
have
believed
it
because
i
had
plenty
what
slaves
got
when
freed
they
said
they
was
gwine
a
give
the
slaves
something
but
they
never
did
do
it
then
the
master
made
out
like
he
was
gwine
a
give
the
slaves
so
much
if
they
stayed
and
made
his
crops
for
him
but
he
do
it
come
again
if
the
lord
lets
you
git
back
tomorrow
try
and
come
a
little
sooner
in
the
day
than
you
did
today
i
gits
up
about
six
in
the
morning
i
believe
in
layin
in
bed
late
i
go
to
bed
directly
after
dark
and
i
wake
up
early
the
lord
never
did
mean
for
nobody
to
sleep

interviewer
comment
a
number
of
people
testify
to
laura
thornton
age
i
am
trying
to
check
up
on
it
results
later
if
she
is
a
hundred
hw
and
five
years
old
she
is
mighty
nigh
it
she
has
feeble
health
but
a
surprisingly
alert
mind
and
a
keen
sharp
memory
she
has
a
tendency
to
confuse
reconstruction
times
with
slavery
times
but
a
little
questioning
always
brings
out
the
facts
she
does
like
to
talk
much
about
marriage
in
slavery
evidently
she
dislikes
the
fact
that
one
of
her
children
ms
born
before
emancipation
she
was
evidently
married
only
once
as
questioning
brought
out
but
she
will
refer
to
the
marriage
before
emancipation
and
the
one
afterward
as
though
they
were

different

age
and
other
masters
blount
steward
was
the
only
master
any
of
us
ever
had
outside
of
my
ma
first
master
the
one
in
kentucky
i
do
know
anything
about
them
i
was
eight
years
old
when
the
war
began
and
twelve
years
old
when
it
ended
i
must
have
been
older
than
that
because
i
was
twelve
years
old
when
i
was
serving
them
soldiers
and
i
had
to
come
away
from
them
before
the
war
was
over
slave
work
the
first
work
i
ever
did
in
slave
time
was
service
when
i
left
the
table
i
left
carrying
my
young
mistress
to
school
six
miles
from
fayette
they
give
me
to
lela
my
young
mistress
she
was
the
young
girl
i
was
carrying
to
school
when
i
got
the
whipping
when
ol
mis
was
whippin
me
i
asked
her
what
she
was
whipping
me
for
and
she
said
you
mine
and
i
can
whip
you
if
i
want
to
she
did
think
that
i
had
done
anything
to
the
girl
she
was
just
mad
that
day
and
i
was
around
so
she
took
it
out
on
me
after
that
i
never
did
any
more
work
as
a
slave
because
the
whole
family
ran
away
about
that
time
i
do
reckon
pa
would
ever
have
run
off
if
ol
miss
had
whipped
me
and
if
ol
massa
had
struck
him
they
rats
good
till
then
but
it
looked
like
the
war
made
them
mean
patrollers
jayhawkers
ku
klux
and
ku
klux
klan
they
had
pateroles
going
watching
the
colored
people
to
keep
them
from
running
off
that
all
i
know
them
i
do
remember
hearin
anything
about
the
jayhawkers
i
heard
lots
the
ku
klux
they
were
terrible
the
white
folks
had
one
another
goin
watching
and
keeping
them
from
runnin
off
the
ku
klux
would
whip
people
they
caught
out
they
would
whip
them
just
because
they
could
because
they
called
themselves
bosses
because
they
was
white
and
the
colored
people
was
niggers
they
did
do
nothin
but
just
keep
the
slaves
down
it
was
before
the
war
that
i
knew
the
ku
klux
there
was
no
difference
between
the
pateroles
and
the
ku
klux
that
i
knows
of
if
they
ketch
you
they
all
would
whip
you
i
do
know
nothin
about
the
ku
klux
klan
after
the
war
i
know
they
broke
them
up
slave
houses
furniture
food
and
work
before
the
war
we
lived
in
a
old
log
house
it
had
one
window
one
door
and
one
room
colored
people
did
have
no
two
or
houses
before
the
war
i
tell
you
that
right
now
all
the
furniture
we
had
was
bed
stools
and
quilts
we
had
them
old
stools
that
pa
made
we
kept
food
right
there
in
the
house
where
we
was
in
one
corner
we
did
have
no
drawers
nothing
like
that
the
white
folks
fed
us
they
give
us
as
much
as
they
thought
we
ought
to
have
every
saturday
night
you
would
go
to
the
smokehouse
and
get
your
meat
and
meal
and
your
molasses
did
get
no
flour
no
coffee
no
sugar
pa
was
an
ox
driver
and
when
he
would
go
to
rodney
to
carry
cotton
he
would
buy
sugar
and
coffee
for
himself
you
see
they
would
slip
a
little
something
and
make
a
little
money
off
it
like
they
was
goin
to
rodney
tomorrow
they
would
slip
and
kill
a
couple
of
hogs
and
carry
them
along
with
them
that
was
the
only
way
they
could
get
a
little
money
my
pa
main
work
was
shoemaking
but
he
worked
in
the
field
too
he
was
a
driver
chiefly
when
he
was
out
in
the
field
he
hoed
and
plowed
he
was
the
leader
of
the
gang
he
never
got
a
chance
to
make
no
money
for
hisself
before
the
war
nope
the
colored
people
did
have
no
money
lessen
they
slipped
and
got
it
slave
marriages
say
i
wanted
this
woman
for
my
wife
we
would
just
put
down
the
broom
and
step
over
it
and
we
would
be
married
that
is
all
there
was
to
it
before
emancipation
did
have
no
matrimony
read
nor
nothing
you
were
married
when
you
stepped
over

interviewer
comment
throughout
his
story
tims
carefully
avoided
using
his
first
name
never
at
any
time
did
he
let
it
slip
the
capture
of
new
orleans
was
effected
in
if
the
troop
with
which
he
worked
took
part
in
the
capture
he
must
have
been
twelve
years
old
by
and
his
age
must
be
at
least
but
this
would
be
inconsistent
with
his
statement
that
he
served
sergeant
josephus
for
two
years
and
a
half
the
detachment
might
have
gone
to
new
orleans
later
than
at
any
rate
tims
is
at
least
and
possibly
older
here
again
we
have
a
definite
conviction
of
the
use
of
the
word
ku
klux
before
the
war
the
way
he
talks
of
it
the
term
might
have
been
a
colloquial
term
applied
to
a
jayhawker
or
a
patroller
he
does
mean
ku
klux
klan
when
he
says
ku
klux
the
lincoln
story
is
included
on
my
part
merely
because
it
is
at
least
legendary
material
i
do
know
what
basis
of
fact
it
could
or
might
have
interviewer
taylor
person
interviewed
hannah
travis
sixteenth
little
rock
ark
age
occupation
housewife
the
jay
hawkers
would
travel
at
night
when
they
came
to
a
cabin
they
would
go
in
and
tell
them
that
owned
it
they
wanted
something
to
eat
and
to
get
it
ready
quick
they
stopped
at
one
place
and
went
in
and
ordered
their
dinner
they
et
the
supper
and
went
away
and
got
sick
after
they
left
they
got
up
the
next
morning
and
examined
the
road
and
the
horse
tracks
and
went
on
they
all
thought
something
had
been
given
to
them
but
i
do
guess
there
was
they
caught
my
mother
and
brought
her
here
and
sold
her
if
they
caught
a
nigger
they
would
carry
him
off
and
sell
him
that
how
my

take
them
things
away
from
my
mother
and
put
em
up
in
the
attic
and
not
allow
her
to
wear
them
they
would
let
the
clothes
rot
and
mildew
before
they
let
my
mother
wear
them
if
my
mother
left
a
dish
dirty
sometimes
there
would
be
butter
or
flour
or
something
in
the
dish
that
would
need
to

soaked
they
would
wait
till

dirty
dish
water
they
whip
her
if

they
took
out
the
old

and
whipped
him
they
made
his
wife
get
up
and
dance
and
she
was
in
a
delicate
state
they
made
her
get
out
of
bed
and
dance
and
after
that
they
took
her
and
whipped
her
and
beat
her
and
she
was
in
a
delicate
state
too
there
was
a
man
there
in
black
rock
though
that
stopped
them
from
bothering
anybody
he
killed
one
of
them
they
went
to
the
train
they
was
raging
around
there
then
he
got
off
the
train
and
they
tried
to
take
him
to
jail
the
jail
was
way
out
through
the
woods
he
had
done
anything
at
all
they
just
took
hold
of
him
to
take
him
to
the
jail
because
he
had
just
come
into
the
town
they
had
tugged
him
down
the
road
and
when
they

big
hogshead
full

that
money
i
reckon
it
was
queen
victoria
but
i
do
know
but
the
white
folks
got
it
and
kept
it
for
themselves

just
put
em
up
on
a
block
and
auction
them
off
the
one
that
give
the
most
he
would
take
em

now
a
clear
recollection
of
conditions
customs
events
and
life
during
those
days
long
past
immediately
proceeding
and
following
the
civil
war
uncle
henry
eyes
have
now
grown
dim
and
he
totters
slightly
as
supported
by
his
cane
he
slowly
shuffles
along
the
path
over
a
short
distance
between
the
clean
cabin
where
he
lives
with
a
daughter
and
the
small
combination
store
and
post
office
on
the
porch
of
which
he
is
accustomed
to
sit
in
an
old
chair
for
a
few
hours
each
day
and
the
white
folks
in
passing
stop
to
speak
a
few
words
and
to
buy
for
him
candy
cold
drinks
and
tobacco
though
uncle
henry
is
approaching
the
century
mark
in
age
his
mind
is
remarkably
clear
and
his
recollection
is
unusually
keen
he
was
born
a
slave
in
northern
mississippi
near
the
small
towns
of
red
banks
and
byhalia
was
the
property
of
his
owner
edmond
turner
and
was
brought
to
phillips
county
by
his
white
folks
some
months
before
the
war
turner
who
owned
some
fifty
other
slaves
besides
henry
settled
with
his
family
on
a
large
acreage
of
land
that
he
had
purchased
about
fifteen
miles
west
of
helena
near
trenton
both
turner
and
his
wife
died
soon
after
taking
up
residence
in
arkansas
leaving
their
estate
to
their
two
sons
bart
and
nat
who
were
by
that
time
grown
young
men
and
being
very
capable
and
industrious
soon
developed
their
property
into
one
of
the
most
valuable
plantations
in
the
county
as
uncle
henry
recalls
the
turner
place
was
it
might
be
said
a
world
within
itself
in
the
confines
of
which
was
produced
practically
everything
essential
in
the
life
of
its
inhabitants
and
the
proper
and
successful
conduct
of
its
operations
large
herds
of
cattle
hogs
sheep
and
goats
provided
a
bountiful
supply
of
both
fresh
and
salt
meats
and
fats
cotton
and
wool
was
carded
spun
and
woven
into
cloth
for
clothes
fast
colored
dyes
were
made
by
boiling
different
kinds
of
roots
and
barks
various
colored
berries
were
also
used
for
this
purpose
medicine
was
prepared
from
roots
herbs
flowers
and
leaves
stake
and
rider
fences
enclosed
the
fields
and
pastures
and
while
most
of
the
houses
barns
and
cribs
were
constructed
of
logs
some
lumber
was
manufactured
in
crude
sawmills
in
which
was
used
what
was
known
as
a
slash
saw
this
was
something
like
the
crosscut
saws
of
today
and
was
operated
by
a
crank
that
gave
the
saw
an
alternating
up
and
down
motion
wheat
was
ground
into
flour
and
corn
into
meal
in
mills
with
stone
burrs
similar
to
those
used
in
the
rural
districts
today
and
power
for
this
operation
was
obtained
through
the
use
of
a
treadmill
that
was
given
its
motion
by
horses
or
mules
walking
on
an
inclined
endless
belt
constructed
of
heavy
wooden
slats
candles
for
lighting
purposes
were
made
of
animal
fats
combined
with
beeswax
plows
harrows
and
cultivating
implements
were
made
on
the
plantation
by
those
negroes
who
had
been
trained
in
carpentry
and
blacksmithing
plows
for
breaking
the
land
were
sometimes
constructed
with
a
metal
point
and
a
wooden
moldboard
and
harrows
made
of
heavy
timbers
with
large
sharpened
wooden
pegs
for
teeth
hats
of
straw
and
corn
shucks
were
woven
by
hand
small
crude
cotton
gins
were
powered
by
horses
or
mules
hitched
to
a
beam
fastened
to
an
upright
shaft
around
which
they
traveled
in
a
circle
and
to
which
was
attached
large
cogwheels
that
multiplied
the
power
enormously
and
transmitted
it
by
means
of
belt
to
the
separating
machinery
where
the
lint
was
torn
from
the
seed
no
metal
ties
were
available
during
this
period
and
ropes
of
cotton
were
used
to
bind
the
bales
of
lint
about
three
bales
was
the
daily
capacity
of
a
plantation
gin
it
was
often
difficult
to
obtain
the
services
of
a
competent
doctor
and
except
in
cases
of
serious
illness
home
remedies
were
administered
churches
were
established
in
different
communities
throughout
the
county
and
the
negro
slaves
were
allowed
the
privilege
of
attending
the
services
certain
pews
being
set
apart
for
them
and
the
same
minister
that
attended
the
spiritual
needs
of
the
master
and
his
family
rendered
like
assistant
to
his
slaves
no
undertaking
establishments
existed
here
at
this
time
and
on
the
death
of
a
person
burial
was
made
in
crude
caskets
built
of
rough
cypress
planks
unless
the
deceased
was
a
member
of
a
family
financially
able
to
afford
the
expensive
metal
caskets
that
were
available
no
nearer
than
memphis
uncle
henry
turner
recalls
the
death
of
dan
wilborn
little
boy
abby
who
was
accidentally
killed
when
crushed
by
a
heavy
gate
on
which
he
was
playing
and
his
burial
in
what
uncle
henry
described
as
a
casket
made
of
the
same
material
as
an
door
knob
and
while
i
have
no
other
authority
than
this
on
the
subject
it
is
possible
that
in
that
day
caskets
were
made
of
some
vitrified
substance
perhaps
clay
and
resembling
the
present
day
tile
the
planters
and
slaveowners
of
this
period
obtained
the
greater
share
of
their
recreation
in
attendance
at
political
rallies
horse
races
and
cock
fights
jobe
dean
and
gus
abington
who
came
to
trenton
from
their
home
near
la
grange
tennessee
were
responsible
for
the
popularity
of
these
sports
in
phillips
county
and
it
was
they
who
promoted
the
most
spectacular
of
these
sporting
events
and
in
which
large
sums
of
money
were
wagered
on
the
horses
and
the
game
cocks
it
is
said
that
marve
carruth
once
owned
an
irish
grey
cock
on
which
he
bet
and
won
more
than
five
thousand
dollars
one
afternoon
at
trenton
no
negro
slave
was
allowed
to
go
beyond
the
confines
of
his
plantation
without
written
permission
this
was
described
by
uncle
henry
turner
as
a
pass
and
on
this
pass
was
written
the
name
of
the
negro
the
place
he
was
permitted
to
visit
and
the
time
beyond
which
he
must
not
fail
to
return
it
seems
that
numbers
of
men
were
employed
by
the
county
or
perhaps
by
the
slaveowners
themselves
whose
duty
it
was
to
patrol
the
community
and
be
on
constant
watch
for
such
negroes
who
attempted
to
escape
their
bondage
or
overstayed
the
time
limit
noted
on
their
pass
such
men
were
known
then
as
paddy
rolls
by
the
negroes
and
in
the
southern
states
are
still
referred
to
by
this
name
punishment
was
often
administered
by
them
and
the
very
mention
of
the
name
was
sufficient
to
cause
stark
terror
and
fear
in
the
hearts
of
fugitive
slaves
at
some
time
during
that
period
when
slavery
was
a
legal
institution
in
this
country
the
following
verse
was
composed
by
some
unknown
author
and
set
to
a
tune
that
some
of
the
older
darkies
can
yet
sing
run
nigger
run
the
paddy
roll
will
get
you
run
nigger
run
it
almost
day
that
nigger
run
that
nigger
flew
that
nigger
tore
his
shirt
into
run
nigger
run
the
paddy
roll
will
get
you
run
nigger
run
it
almost
day
both
bart
turner
and
his
brother
nat
enlisted
in
the
services
of
the
confederacy
nat
turner
was
a
member
of
the
first
arkansas
volunteers
a
regiment
organized
at
helena
and
of
which
patrick
cleburne
was
colonel
dick
berry
and
milt
wiseman
friends
and
neighbors
of
the
turners
also
volunteered
and
enlisted
in
cleburne
command
these
three
stalwart
young
men
from
phillips
county
followed
cleburne
and
fought
under
his
battle
flag
on
those
bloody
fields
at
shiloh
murfreesboro
ringgold
gap
and
atlanta
and
they
were
with
him
that
day
in
november
in
front
of
the
old
gin
house
at
franklin
as
the
regiment
formed
for
another
and
what
was
to
be
their
last
charge
the
dead
lay
in
heaps
in
front
of
them
and
almost
filled
the
ditch
around
the
breastworks
but
the
command
though
terribly
cut
to
pieces
was
forming
as
cooly
as
if
on
dress
parade
above
them
floated
a
peculiar
flag
a
field
of
deep
blue
on
which
was
a
crescent
moon
and
stars
it
was
cleburne
battle
flag
and
well
the
enemy
knew
it
they
had
seen
it
so
often
before
i
tip
my
hat
to
that
flag
said
the
federal
general
sherman
years
after
the
war
whenever
my
men
saw
it
they
knew
it
meant
fight
as
the
regiment
rushed
on
the
federal
breastworks
a
gray
clad
figure
on
a
chestnut
horse
rode
across
the
front
of
the
moving
column
and
toward
the
enemy
guns
the
horse
went
down
within
fifty
yards
of
the
breastworks
the
rider
arose
waved
his
sword
and
led
his
men
on
foot
to
the
very
ramparts
then
he
staggered
and
fell
pierced
with
a
dozen
balls
it
was
cleburne
the
peerless
of
confederate
brigade
commanders
the
southern
cause
suffered
a
crushing
defeat
at
franklin
and
the
casualty
list
recorded
the
names
of
nat
turner
dick
berry
and
milt
wiseman
who
like
their
beloved
commander
had
given
their
life
for
their
country
there
is
an
inscription
on
the
stone
base
of
the
magnificent
bronze
statue
of
general
forrest
astride
his
war
horse
in
forrest
park
in
memphis
that
could
well
be
placed
above
the
graves
of
cleburne
turner
berry
and
wiseman
those
brave
heroic
soldiers
from
phillips
county
the
