as
the
experiments
described
in

were
on
a
small
scale
exception
might
be
taken
to
them
and
therefore
the
writer
has
made
this
experiment
on
a
scale
sufficiently
large
to
be
much
more
conclusive

shown

wooden
abutments
wide
apart
and
about
high
were
built
and
filled
solidly
with
sand
wooden
walls

then
built
crossing
the
abutments
and
solidly
cleated
and
braced
frames
were
placed
across
their
ends
about
back
of
each
abutment
a
false
bottom
made
to
slide
freely
up
and
down
between
the
abutments
and
projecting
slightly
beyond
the
walls
on
each
side
was
then
blocked
up
snugly
to
the
bottom

of
the
sides
thus
obtaining
a

the

long
threads
were
run
up
through
the
false
bottom
and
through
by
by
pine
washers
to
nuts
on
the
top
the
box
was
filled
with
ordinary
coarse
sand
from
the
trench
the
sand
being
compacted
as
thoroughly
as
possible
the
ends
were
tightened
down
on
the
washers
which
in
turn
bore
on
the
compacted
sand
the
blocking
was
then
knocked
out
from
under
the
false
bottom
and
the
following
was
noted
as
soon
as
the
blocking
was
removed
the
bottom
settled

as
noted
in
fig

due
to
the
initial
compacting
of
the
sand

the
arching
stresses
a
measurement
was
taken
from
the
bottom
of
the
washers
to
the
top
of
the
false
bottom
and
it
was
noted
as
in
fig
after
some
three
or
four
hours
as
the
arch
had
not
been
broken
it
was
decided
to
test
it

greater
loading

four
men
were
placed
on

four
others

on
the
haunches

shown
in
fig

under
this
additional
loading
of
about
lb
the
bottom
settled
in
more
or
nearly
in
in
all
due
to
the
further
compression
of
the
sand
arch
about
an
hour
after
the
superimposed
load
had
been
removed
the
writer
jostled
the
box
with
his
foot
sufficiently
to
dislodge
some
of
the
exposed
sand
when
the
arch
at
once
collapsed
and
the
bottom
fell
to
the
ground
referring
to
fig
if
instead

being
ordinary

the

can
be
no
reason
to
suppose
that
it

all

concede

thus
relieving
the
structure

of
the

to
the

of

that
the

probably

when

also
probably
true

not
add
to
the

strength
more
especially
in
those
materials
where

may
not
be
counted
on
as
a
factor
this
is
borne
out
by
the
fact
that
in
the
experiment
noted
a
crack
developed
on
the
surface
of
the
sand
at
about

the

good

sharp

some
gravel

was
taken
directly
from
the
adjoining
excavation
when
thrown
loosely
in
a
heap
it
assumed
an
angle
of
repose
of
about
degrees
it
should
be
noted
that
this
material
when

was
not
compacted
as
much
nor
did
it
possess
the
same
cohesion
as
sand
in
its
normal
undisturbed
condition
in
a
bank
and
for
this
reason
it
is
believed
that
the
depth
of
key
given
here
is
absolutely
safe
for
all

extraordinary
conditions

as

others
which
may
require

consideration
referring
again
to
the

it
is
probable
that
while
some
at
least
of
the
lower
portion
must
derive
its
initial
support
from
the
centering
below
and
the
writer
has
made
the
arbitrary
assumption
that
the
lower
half
of
it
is
carried
by
the
structure
while
the
upper
half
is
entirely
independent
of
it
and
in
making
this
assumption
he
believes
he
is
adding
a
factor
of
safety
thereto
the
area
then
which
is
assumed
to
be
carried
by
an
underground
structure
the
depth
of
which
is
sufficient
to
allow
the

to
intersect

that
these

of

pressure
transmission
will
be
straight
but
for
purposes
of
calculation
they
will
be
assumed
to
be
so
also
that
they
will
act
along
and
parallel
to
the
lines
of
repose
of
their
natural
slope
and
that
the
thrust
of
the
earth
will
therefore
be
measured
by
the
relation
between
the

the

the
application
of
the
above
to
or
circular
tunnels
is
very
simple
except
that
the
question
of
side
thrust
should
be
considered
also
as
a
factor
the
thrust
against
the
side
of
a
tunnel
in
dry
sand
having
a
flat
angle
of
repose
will
necessarily
be
greater
than
in
very
moist
sand
or
clay
which
stands
at
a
much
steeper
angle
and
for
the
same
reason
the
arch
thrust
is
greater
in
dryer
sand
and
therefore
the
load
on
a
tunnel
structure
should
not
be
as
great
the
material
being
compact
and
excluding
cohesion
as
a
factor
this
can
be
illustrated
by
referring
to
fig
in
which
it
is
seen
that
the
flatter
the
position
of
the
rakers
keying
at
and
the
greater
will
be
the
side
thrust
at
and
it
can
also
be
illustrated
by
assuming
that
the
arching
material
is
composed
of
cubes
of
polished
marble
set
one
vertically
above
the
other
in
close
columns
there
would
then
be
absolutely
no
side
thrust
but
likewise
no
arching
properties
would
be
developed
and
an
indefinite
height
would
probably
be
reached
above
the
tunnel
roof
before
friction
enough
would
be
developed
to
cause
it
to
relieve
the
structure
of
any
part
of
its
load
conversely
if
it
be
assumed
that
the
superadjacent
material
is
composed
of
large
bowling
balls
interlocking
with
some
degree
of
regularity
it
can
be
seen
that
those
above
will
form
themselves
into
an
arch
over
the
centering
made
up
of
those
supported
directly
by
the
roof
of
the
structure
thus
relieving
the
structure
of
any
load
except
that
due
to
this
centering
if
now
the
line
in
fig
be
drawn
so
as
to
form
with
the
angle
beta
to
be
noted
later
and
it
be
assumed
that
it
measures
the
area
of
pressure
against
and
if
the
line
be
drawn
forming
with
the
angle
alpha
noted
above
then
can
be
reduced
in
some
measure
by
reason
of
the
increase
of
to
because
the
side
thrust
above
the
line
has
slightly
diminished
the
loading
above
the
writer
makes
the
arbitrary
assumption
that
this
decrease
in
should
equal
of
if
then
the
line
be
drawn
it
is
conceded
that
all
the
material
within
the
area

causes
direct
pressure
against
or
upon
the
structure
c
the
vertical
lines
being
the
ordinates
of
pressure
due
to
weight
and
the
horizontal
lines
qualified
by
certain
ratios
being
the
abscissas
of
pressure
due
to
thrust
an
extreme
measurement
of
this
area
of
pressure
is
doubtless
approximately
more
nearly
a
curve
than
the
straight
lines
given
and
the
curve

is
therefore
drawn
in
to
give
graphically
and
approximately
the
safe
area
of
which
any
vertical
ordinate
multiplied
by
the
weight
gives
the
pressure
on
the
roof
at
that
point
and
any
horizontal
line
or
abscissa
divided
by
the
tangent
of
the
angle
of
repose
and
multiplied
by
the
weight
per
foot
gives
the
pressure
on
the
side
at
that
point
illustration

the
practical
conclusion
of
this
whole
assumption
is
that
the
material
in
the
area
e
c

forms
with
the
equivalent
opposite
area
an
arch
reacting
against
the
face

and
that
as
heretofore
noted
the
lower
half
or
its
equivalent

of
the
weight
of
this
is
assumed
to
be
carried
by
the
structure
the
upper
half
being
as
shown
by

line

or
for
absolute
safety
the
curved

and
therefore
if
rods
could
be
run
from
sheeting
inside
the
tunnel
area
to
a
point
outside
the
line
as
indicated
by
the
lines
that
the
internal
bracing
of
this
tunnel
could
be
omitted
or
that
the
tunnel
itself
would
be
relieved
of
all
loading
whereas
these
rods
would
be
carrying
some
large
portion
at
least
of
the
weight
within
the
area
circumscribed
by
the
curve
ii

and
further
that
a
tunnel
structure
of
the
approximate
dimensions
shown
would
carry
its
maximum
load
with
the
surface
of
the
ground
between
iv

beyond
which
point
the
pressure
would
remain
the
same
for
all
depths

calculating
pressures

the

first
be
graphically
resolved

the

evidence
that
in

ground
not

the
pressures
do
not
exceed
in
any

those
found

to
suppose

undoubtedly
a
stable
condition

one
which
could
not
fail
in
theory

practice
nor
can
anyone
looking
at
fig
doubt
that
the
top
timbers
are
stressed
more
heavily
than
those
at
the
bottom
the
assumption
is
that
the
tendency
of
the
material
to
slide
toward
the
toe
causes
it
to
wedge
itself
between
the
face
of
the
sheeting
on
the
one
hand
and
some
plane
between
the
sheeting
and
the
plane
of
repose
on
the
other
and
that
the
resistance
to
this
tendency
will
cause
an
arching
thrust
to
be
developed
along
or
parallel
to
the
lines
fig
which
are
assumed
to
be
the
lines
of
repose
or
curves
approximating
thereto
as
the
thrust
is
greatest
in
that
material
directly
at
the
face
fig

is
nothing
at
the
plane
of
repose
it
may
be
assumed
arbitrarily
that
the
line
bisecting
this
angle
divides
this
area
into
two
in
one
of
which
the
weight
resolves
itself
wholly
into
thrust
the
other
being
an
area
of
no
thrust
or
wholly
of
weight
bearing
on
the
plane
of
repose

the
next
points
to

are
the
more
difficult
problems
concerning
subaqueous
or
saturated
earths
the
writer
has
made
some
experiments
which
appear
to
be
conclusive
showing
that
except
in
pure
quicksand
or
wholly
aqueous
material
as
described
later
the
earth
and
water
pressures
act
independently
of
each
other
for
a
better
understanding
of
the
scope
and
purpose
of
this
paper
the
writer
divides
supersaturated
or
subaqueous
materials
into
three
classes
firm
materials
such
as
coarse
and
fine
gravels
gravel
and
sands
mixed
coarse
sands
and
fine
sands
in
which
there
is
not
a
large
proportion
of
fine
material
such
as
loam
clay
or
pure
quicksand
materials
such
as
fine
sands
in
which
there
is
a
large
proportion
of
clay
pure
clays
silts
peats
etc
aqueous
materials
such
as
pure
quicksands
in
which
the
solid
matter
is
so
finely
divided
that
it
is
amorphous
and
virtually
held
in
suspension
oils
quicksilver
etc
here
it
may
be
stated
that
the
term
quicksand
is
so
illusive
that
a
true
definition
of
it
is
badly
needed
many
engineers
call
quicksand
any
sand
which
flows
under
the
influence
of
water
in
motion
the
writer
believes
the
term
should
be
applied
only
to
material
so
soupy
that
its
properties
are
practically
the
same
as
water
under
static
conditions
it
being
understood
that
any
material
may
be
unstable
under
the
influence
of
water
at
sufficiently
high
velocities
and
that
it
is
with
a
static
condition
or
one
approximately
so
that
this
paper
deals
a
clear
understanding
of
the
firm
materials
noted
in
class
a
will
lead
to
a
better
solution
of
problems
dealing
with
those
under
class
b
as
it
is
to
this
class
a
that

experiments
largely
relate
the
experiments
noted
below

made
with

material

the
principal
type
used
was
a
fine
sand
under
the
conditions
in
which
it
is
ordinarily
found
in

with
less
than

the
conditions

that

not

repeated
numberless
times

invariably
with

result

the
deduction
from
this
experiment
is
that
the
pressure
of
water
is
against
rather
than
through
sand
and
that
any
excess
of
voids
occurring
adjacent
to
a
face

there
is
pressure
of
water
will
be
filled
with
sand

when
in
clear
water
alone
and
in
the
case
thus
noted
where
it
was
surrounded
by
sand
would
measure
the
friction
of
the
sand
on
the
piston
after
several
trials
of
this
however
it
was
clearly
seen
that
the
friction
was
too
slight
to
be
noted
accurately
by
a
gauge
registering
single
pounds
that
is
with
a
piston
in
contact
with
in
of
sand
vertically
a
friction
of
lb
per
sq
would
only
require
an
increase
of
lb
on
the
gauge
it
is
therefore
assumed
that
the
friction
on
so
small
a
piston
in
sand
need
not
be
considered
as
a
material
factor
in
the
experiments
made
the
piston
was
plunged
into
clear
water
and
it
was
found
that
the
pressure
required
to
lift
it
was
about
lb
the
cap
was
then
taken
off
a
depth
of
about
in
of
sand
was
placed
in
the
bottom
of
the
chamber
and
then
the
piston
was
set
in
place
and
surrounded
by
sand
to
a
depth
of
some
water
being
added
so
that
the
sand
was
completely
saturated
this
was
allowed
to
stand
until
it
had
regained
the
stability
of
ordinary
sand
in
place
whereupon
the
cap
with
the
collar
bearing
was
set
in
place
over
the
piston
the
machine
was
coupled
up
and
the
pump
was
started
a
series
of
four
experiments
extending
over
a
period
of
two
or
three
days
gave
the
following
results
the
piston
began
to
move
at
a
pressure
of
lb
the
pressure
gradually
dropped
to
at
which
point
apparently
it
came
out
of
the
sand
and
continued
at
lb
during
the
remainder
of
the
test
the
piston
was
plunged
back
into
the
sand
without
removing
the
cap
and
allowed
to
stand
for
about
hours
no
attempt
was
made
to
pack
the
sand
or
to
see
its
condition
around
the
piston
it
being
presumed
however
that
it
had
reasonable
time
to
get
a
fair
amount
of
set
at
slightly
above
lb
the
piston
began
to
move
and
as
soon
as
a
pocket
of
water
accumulated
behind
the
piston
the
pressure
immediately
dropped
to
lb
and
continued
at
this
point
until
it
came
out
of
the
sand
the
piston
was
plunged
into
the
sand
and
hammered
down
without
waiting
for
the
sand
to
come
to
a
definite
set
in
this
case
the
initial
pressure
shown
by
the
gauge
was
which
immediately
dropped
to
lb
as
soon
as
the
piston
had
moved
sufficiently
far
to
allow
water
to
accumulate
below
it
the
cap
was
again
removed
the
piston
set
up
in
place
the
sand
compacted
around
it
in
approximately
the
same
condition
it
would
have
had
if
the
sand
had
been
in
place
underground
the
cap
was
then
set
in
place
and
after
an
hour
the
pump
was
started
the
pressure
registered
was
lb
and
extended
over
a
period
of
several
seconds
before
there
was
any
movement
in
the
piston
the
piston
responded
finally
without
any
increase
of
pressure
and
after
lifting
an
inch
or
two
the
pressure
gradually
dropped
to
where
it
remained
until
the
piston
came
out
of
the
sand
the
sum
and
average
of
these
tests
shows
a
relation
of
lb
for
the
piston
in
sand
to
about
lb
as
soon
as
the
volume
of
water
had
accumulated
below
it
which
would
correspond
very
closely
to
a
sand
containing
of
voids
which
was
the
characteristic
of
the
sand
used
in
this
experiment
the
conclusions
from
this
experiment
appear
to
be
absolutely
final
in
illustrating
the
pressure
due
to
water
on
a
tunnel
buried
in
sand
either
on
the
arch
above
or
on
the
sides
or
bottom
as
well
as
the
buoyant
effect
upon
the
tunnel
bottom
under
the
same
conditions
while
the
apparatus
would
have
to
be
designed
and
built
on
a
much
larger
scale
in
order
to
measure
accurately
the
pressures
due
to
sands
and
earths
of
varying
characteristics
it
appears
to
be
conclusive
in
showing
the
principle
and
near
enough
to
the
theoretical
value
to
be
taken
for
practical
purposes
in
designing
structures
against
water
pressures
when
buried
in
sand
or
earth
it
should
be
carefully
noted
that
the
friction
of
the
water
through
sand
which
is
always
a
large
factor
in
subaqueous
construction
is
virtually
eliminated
here
as
the
water
pressure
has
to
be
transmitted
only
some
or
in
to
actuate
the
base
of
the
piston
whereas
in
a
tunnel
only
half
submerged
this
distance
might
be
as
many
feet
and
would
be
a
considerable
factor
it
should
be
noted
also
that
although
the
area
subject
to
pressure
is
diminished
the
pressure
on
the
area
remaining
corresponds
to
the
full
hydrostatic
head
as
would
be
shown
by
the
pressure
on
an
air
gauge
required
to
hold
back
the
water
except
of
course
as
it
may
be
diminished
more
or
less
by
friction
the
writer
understands
that
experiments
of
a
similar
nature
and
with
similar
apparatus
have
been
tried
on
clays
and
peats
with
results
considerably
higher
that
is
in
one
case
there
was
a
pressure
of
lb
before
the
piston
started
to
move
the
following
is
given
in
part
as
an
analysis
and
explanation
of
the
above
experiments
and
notes
it
is
well
known
that
if
lead
be
placed
in
a
hydraulic
press
and
subjected
to
a
sufficient
pressure
it
will
exhibit
properties
somewhat
similar
to
soft
clay
or
quicksand
under
pressure
it
will
flow
out
of
an
orifice
or
more
than
one
orifice
at
the
same
pressure
this
is
due
to
the
fact
that
practically
voids
do
not
exist
and
that
the
pressure
is
so
great
compared
with
the
molecular
cohesion
that
the
latter
is
virtually
nullified
it
is
also
theoretically
true
that
solid
stone
under
infinitely
high
pressure
may
be
liquefied
if
in
the
cylinder
of
a
hydraulic
press
there
be
put
a
certain
quantity
of
cobblestones
leaving
a
clearance
between
the
top
of
the
stone
and
the
piston
and
if
this
space
together
with
the
voids
be
filled
with
water
and
subjected
to
a
great
pressure
the
sides
or
the
walls
of
the
cylinder
are
acted
on
by
two
pressures
one
almost
negligible
where
they
are
in
contact
with
the
stone
restraining
the
tendency
of
the
stone
to
roll
or
slide
outward
and
the
other
due
to
the
pressure
of
the
water
over
the
area
against
which
there
is
no
contact
of
stone
that
this
area
of
contact
should
be
deducted
from
the
pressure
area
can
be
clearly
shown
by
assuming
another
cylinder
with
jammed
into
it
as
shown
in
fig
a
glance
at
this
figure
will
show
that
there
is
no
aqueous
pressure
on
the
walls
of
the
cylinder
with
which
the
ends
of
the
sticks
come
in
contact
and
the
loss
of
the
pressure
against
the
walls
due
to
this
is
equal
to
the
least
sectional
area
of
the
stick
or
tube
either
at
the
point
of
contact
or
intermediate
thereto
following
this
reasoning
in
fig
it
is
found
that
an
equivalent
area
may
be
deducted
covering
the
least
area
of
continuous
contact
of
the
cobblestones
as
shown
along
the
dotted
lines
in
the
right
half
of
the
figure
returning
if
when
the
pressure
is
applied
an
orifice
be
made
in
the
cylinder
the
water
will
at
once
flow
out
under
pressure
allowing
the
piston
to
come
in
contact
with
the
cobblestones
if
the
flow
of
the
water
were
controlled
so
as
to
stop
it
at
the
point
where
the
stone
and
water
are
both
under
direct
pressure
it
would
be
found
that
the
pressures
were
totally
independent
of
each
other
the
aqueous
pressure
for
instance
would
be
equal
at
every
point
while
the
pressure
on
the
stone
would
be
through
and
along
the
lines
of
contact
if
this
contact
was
reasonably
well
made
and
covered
of
the
area
one
would
expect
the
stone
independently
of
the
water
to
stand
of
the
pressure
which
a
full
area
of
solid
stone
would
stand
if
this
pressure
should
be
enormously
increased
after
excluding
the
water
it
would
finally
result
in
crushing
the
stone
into
a
solid
mass
and
if
the
pressure
should
be
increased
indefinitely
some
theoretical
point
would
be
reached
as
above
noted
where
the
stone
would
eventually
be
liquefied
and
would
assume
liquid
properties
illustration
fig
illustration
fig
the
same
general
reasoning
applies
to
pure
sand
sand
being
in
effect
cobblestones
in
miniature
in
pressing
the
piston
down
on
dry
sand
it
will
be
displaced
into
every
existing
abnormal
void
but
will
be
displaced
into
these
voids
rather
than
pressed
into
them
in
the
true
definition
of
the
word
and
while
it
would
flow
out
of
an
orifice
in
the
sides
or
bottom
allowing
the
piston
to
be
forced
down
as
in
a
it
would
not
flow
out
of
an
orifice
in
the
top
of
the
piston
except
under
pressures
so
abnormally
high
as
to
make
the
mass
theoretically
aqueous
if
the
positions
of
cylinder
and
piston
be
reversed
the
piston
pointing
vertically
upward
and
the
sand
bled
into
an
orifice
in
or
through
it
the
void
caused
by
the
outflow
of
this
sand
would
be
filled
by
sand
displaced
by
the
piston
pressing
upward
rather
than
by
sand
from
above
it
was
the
knowledge
of
this
principle
which
enabled
the
contractors
to
jack
up
successfully
the
roof
of
a
long
section
of
the
lined
tubes
under
joralemon
street
in
brooklyn
in
connection
with
the
reconstruction
of
the
battery
tubes
at
that
point
the
method
of
operation
as
partly
shown
in
fig
plate
xxviii
being
to
cut
through
a
section
of
the
roof
by
in
area
through
which
holes
were
drilled
and
through
which
again
the
sand
was
bled
heavy
pressure
being
applied
from
below
through
the
medium
of
hydraulic
jacks
by
a
careful
manipulation
of
both
these
operations
sections
of
the
roof
of
the
above
dimensions
were
eventually
raised
the
required
height
of
in
and
permanently
braced
there
in
a
single
shift
if
water
in
excess
be
put
into
a
cylinder
containing
sand
and
pressure
be
applied
thereto
the
water
if
allowed
to
flow
out
of
an
orifice
will
carry
with
it
a
certain
quantity
of
sand
according
to
the
velocity
and
the
observation
of
this
might
easily
give
rise
to
the
erroneous
impression
that
the
sand
as
well
as
the
water
was
flowing
out
under
pressure
and
as
heretofore
stated
has
caused
many
engineers
and
contractors
to
apply
the
term
quicksand
to
any
sand
flowing
through
an
orifice
with
water
sand
in
its
natural
bed
always
contains
some
fine
material
and
where
this
is
largely
less
than
the
percentage
of
voids
it
has
no
material
effect
on
the
pressure
exerted
by
the
sand
with
or
without
water
as
above
noted
if
however
this
fine
material
be
largely
in
excess
of
the
voids
it
allows
greater
initial
compression
to
take
place
when
dry
and
allows
to
be
set
up
a
certain
amount
of
hydraulic
action
when
saturated
if
the
base
of
the
material
be
sand
and
the
fill
be
quicksand
in
excess
of
the
voids
pressure
will
cause
the
quicksand
to
set
up
hydraulic
action
and
the
action
of
the
piston
will
appear
to
be
similar
to
that
of
a
piston
acting
on
purely
aqueous
material
just
here
the
writer
desires
to
protest
against
considering
masses
such
as
soupy
sands
soft
concrete
as
exerting
hydrostatic
pressure
due
to
their
weight
in
bulk
instead
of
to
the
specific
gravity
of
the
basic
liquid
for
instance
resorting
again
to
the
illustration
of
cubes
and
spheres
it
may
be
assumed
that
a
cubical
receptacle
has
been
partly
filled
with
small
cubes
of
polished
marble
piled
vertically
in
columns
when
this
receptacle
is
filled
with
liquid
around
the
piles
of
cubes
there
will
be
no
pressure
on
the
sides
except
that
due
to
the
hydrostatic
pressure
of
the
water
at
lb
the
bottom
however
will
resist
a
combined
pressure
due
to
the
water
and
the
weight
of
the
cubes
again
assume
that
the
receptacle
is
filled
with
small
spheres
such
as
marbles
and
that
water
is
then
poured
in
the
pressure
due
to
the
weight
of
the
solids
on
the
bottom
is
relieved
by
the
loss
in
weight
of
the
marbles
due
to
the
water
and
also
to
the
tendency
of
the
marbles
to
arch
over
the
bottom
and
while
the
pressure
on
the
sides
is
increased
by
this
amount
of
thrust
the
aqueous
pressure
is
still
that
of
a
liquid
at
and
it
is
inconceivable
that
some
engineers
in
calculating
the
thrust
of
aqueous
masses
speak
of
it
as
a
liquid
weighing
say
or
lb
per
cu
as
well
might
they
expect
to
anchor
spherical
copper
floats
in
front
of
a
bulkhead
and
expect
the
hydrostatic
pressure
against
this
bulkhead
to
be
diminished
because
the
actual
volume
and
weight
of
the
water
directly
in
front
of
the
bulkhead
has
been
diminished
those
who
have
had
experience
in
tying
narrow
deep
forms
for
concrete
with
small
wires
or
bolts
and
quickly
filling
them
with
liquid
concrete
must
realize
that
no
such
pressures
are
ever
developed
as
would
correspond
to
liquids
of
lb
per
cu
ft
if
the
solid
material
in
any
liquid
is
agitated
so
that
it
is
virtually
in
suspension
it
can
not
add
to
the
pressure
and
if
allowed
to
subside
it
acts
as
a
solid
independently
of
the
water
contained
with
it
although
the
water
may
change
somewhat
the
properties
of
the
material
by
increasing
or
changing
its
cohesion
angle
of
repose
etc
that
is
in
substance
those
particles
which
rest
solidly
on
the
bottom
and
are
in
contact
to
the
top
of
the
solid
material
do
not
derive
any
buoyancy
from
the
water
while
those
particles
not
in
contact
with
the
bottom
directly
or
through
other
particles
lose
just
so
much
weight
through
buoyancy
if
then
the
vertical
depth
of
the
earthy
particles
or
sand
above
the
bottom
is
so
small
that
the
arching
effect
against
the
sides
is
negligible
the
full
weight
of
the
particles
in
contact
directly
or
vicariously
with
the
bottom
acts
as
pressure
on
the
bottom
while
the
full
pressure
of
the
water
acts
through
the
voids
or
on
them
or
is
transmitted
through
material
in
contact
with
the
bottom
referring
now
to
materials
such
as
clays
peats
and
other
soft
or
plastic
materials
it
is
idle
to
assume
that
these
do
not
possess
and
arching
properties
for
instance
a
soft
clay
arch
of
larger
dimensions
under
the
condition
described
early
in
this
paper
would
undoubtedly
stand
if
the
rods
supporting
the
intrados
of
the
arch
were
keyed
back
to
washers
covering
a
sufficiently
large
area
the
fact
that
compressed
air
can
be
used
at
all
in
tunnel
work
is
evidence
that
materials
have
arching
properties
and
the
fact
that
blows
usually
occur
in
light
cover
is
further
evidence
of
it
when
air
pressure
is
used
to
hold
back
the
water
in
faces
of
large
area
bracing
has
to
be
resorted
to
this
again
shows
that
while
full
hydrostatic
pressure
is
required
to
hold
back
the
water
the
pressure
of
the
earth
is
in
a
measure
independent
of
it
in
a
peaty
or
boggy
material
there
is
a
condition
somewhat
different
but
sufficiently
allied
to
the
soft
clayey
or
soupy
sands
to
place
it
under
the
same
head
in
ordinary
practice
it
is
undoubtedly
true
that
piles
can
be
driven
to
an
indefinite
depth
in
this
material
and
it
is
also
true
that
the
action
of
the
pile
is
to
displace
rather
than
compress
as
shown
by
the
fact
of
driving
portions
of
the
tunnels
under
the
north
river
for
long
distances
without
opening
the
doors
of
the
shield
or
removing
any
of
the
material
the
case
of
filling
in
bogs
or
marshes
causing
them
to
sink
at
the
point
of
filling
and
rise
elsewhere
is
readily
explained
by
the
fact
that
the
water
is
confined
in
the
interstices
of
the
material
admitting
of
displacement
but
no
compression
the
application
of
the
above
to
pressures
over
tunnels
in
materials
of
class
a
is
that
the
sand
or
solid
matter
is
virtually
assumed
to
be
a
series
of
columns
with
their
bases
in
such
intimate
contact
with
the
tunnel
roof
that
water
can
not
exert
pressure
on
the
tunnel
or
buoyancy
on
the
sand
at
the
point
of
contact
and
that
if
these
columns
are
sufficiently
deep
to

next
as
to
the
question
of
buoyancy
in

a
materials
if
a
submerged
structure
rests
firmly
on
a
bottom
of
more
or
less
firm
sand
its
buoyancy
as
indicated
by
the
experiments
will
only
be
a
percentage
of
its
buoyancy
in
pure
water
corresponding
to
the
voids
in
the
sand
in
practice
however
an
attempt
to
show
this
condition
will
fail
owing
to
the
fact
that
in
such
a
structure
the
water
will
almost
immediately
work
under
the
edge
and
bottom
and
cause
the
structure
to
rise
and
the
test
can
only
be
made
by
measuring
the
difference
in
uplift
in
a
structure
as
shown
in
experiment
no
for
if
a
structure
lighter
than
the
displaced
water
be
buried
in
sand
sufficiently
deep
to
insure
it
against
the
influx
of
large
volumes
of
water
below
it
will
not
rise
that
this
is
not
due
entirely
to
the
friction
of
the
solid
material
on
the
sides
has
been
demonstrated
by
the
observation
of
subaqueous
structures
which
always
tend
to
subside
rather
than
to
lift
during
or
following
disturbance
of
the
surrounding
earth
the
following
is
quoted
from
the
paper
by
charles
jacobs
am
soc
on
the
north
river
division
of
the
pennsylvania
railroad
tunnels
e
there
was
considerable
subsidence
in
the
tunnels
during
construction
and
lining
amounting
to
an
average
of
between
the
bulkhead
lines
this
settlement
has
been
constantly
decreasing
since
construction
and
appears
to
have
been
due
almost
entirely
to
the
disturbances
of
the
surrounding
materials
during
construction
the
silt
weighs
about
lb
per
cu
and
contains
about
of
water
it
was
found
that
whenever
this
material
was
disturbed
outside
the
tunnels
a
displacement
of
the
tunnels
followed
this
in
substance
confirms
observations
made
in
the
battery
tubes
that
subsidence
of
the
structure
followed
disturbance
of
the
outside
material
although
theoretically
the
tubes
were
buoyant
in
the
aqueous
material
the
writer
would
urge
however
that
in
all
cases
of
submerged
structures
only
partially
buried
in
solid
material
excess
weighting
be
used
to
cover
the
contingencies
of
vibration
oscillation
to
which
such
structures
may
be
subjected
and
which
may
ultimately
allow
leads
of
water
to
work
their
way
underneath
on
the
other
hand
he
urges
that
in
cases
of
floor
areas
of
deeply
submerged
structures
such
as
tunnels
or
cellars
the
pressure
to
be
resisted
should
be
assumed
to
be
only
slightly
in
excess
of
that
corresponding
to
the
pressure
due
to
the
water
through
the
voids
the
question
of
pressure
in
class
b
or
materials
will
be
considered
next
of
these
materials
as
already
shown
there
are
two
types
sand
in
which
the
quicksand
is
largely
in
excess
of
any
normal
voids
and
plastic
and
viscous
materials
the
writer
believes
that
these
materials
should
be
treated
as
mixtures
of
solid
and
watery
particles
in
the
first
of
which
the
quicksand
or
aqueous
portion
being
virtually
in
suspension
may
be
treated
as
water
and
it
must
be
concluded
that
the
action
here
will
be
similar
to
that
of
sand
and
pure
water
giving
a
larger
value
to
the
properties
of
water
than
actually
exists
if
for
instance
it
should
be
found
that
such
a
mixture
contained
of
pure
water
the
writer
would
estimate
its
pressure
on
or
against
a
structure
as
that
of
a
moist
sand
standing
at
a
steep
angle
of
repose
and
that
of
clear
water
an
allowance
of
of
the
total
volume
being
assumed
and
the
sum
of
these
two
results
giving
the
total
pressure
until
more
definite
data
can
be
obtained
by
experiments
on
a
larger
scale
this
assumed
value
of
of
the
total
volume
for
the
aqueous
portion
may
be
taken
for
all
conditions
of
materials
except
of
course
where
the
solid
and
aqueous
particles
may
be
clearly
defined
the
pressures
being
computed
as
described
in
the
preceding
pages
as
to
the
question
of
pure
quicksand
if
such
there
be
and
other
aqueous
materials
of
class
c
such
as
water
oil
mercury
it
has
already
been
shown
that
they
are
to
be
considered
as
liquids
of
their
normal
specific
gravity
that
is
in
calculating
the
air
pressure
necessary
to
displace
them
one
should
consider
their
specific
gravity
only
as
a
factor
and
not
the
total
weight
per
volume
including
any
impurities
which
they
might
contain
undissolved
in
order
to
have
a
clearer
conception
of
aqueous
and
materials
and
their
action
they
must
be
viewed
under
conditions
not
ordinarily
apparent
for
instance
ideas
of
quicksand
are
largely
drawn
from
seeing
structures
sinking
into
it
or
from
observing
it
flowing
through
voids
in
the
sheeting
or
casing
the
action
of
sand
and
water
under
pressure
is
viewed
during
or
after
a
slump
when
the
damage
is
being
done
or
has
been
done
whereas
the
correct
is
under
static
conditions
before
the
slump
takes
place
the
following
is
quoted
from
the
report
of
jacobs
chief
engineer
of
the
east
river
gas
tunnel
built
in
we
found
that
the
material
which
had
heretofore
been
firm
or
stiff
had
under
erosion
obtained
a
consistency
and
that
a
huge
cavity
some
wide
and
deep
had
been
washed
up
toward
the
river
bed
this
would
probably
be
a
fair
description
of
much
of
the
material
of
this
class
met
with
in
such
work
if
compressed
air
had
not
been
used
the
writer
believes
that
in
soft
material
surrounding
submerged
structures
the
water
actually
contained
in
the
voids
is
not
infrequently
after
a
prolonged
period
of
rest
cut
off
absolutely
from
its
sources
of
pressure
and
that
contact
with
these
sources
of
pressure
will
not
again
be
resumed
until
a
leak
takes
place
through
the
structure
and
even
when
there
is
a
small
flow
or
trickling
of
water
through
such
material
it
confines
itself
to
certain
paths
or
channels
and
is
largely
excluded
from
the
general
mass
the
broad
principle
of
the
bearing
power
of
soil
has
been
made
the
subject
of
too
many
experiments
and
too
much
controversy
to
be
considered
in
a
paper
which
is
intended
to
be
a
description
of
experiments
and
observed
data
and
notes
therefrom
the
writer
is
of
the
opinion
however
that
entirely
too
little
attention
has
been
given
to
this
bearing
power
of
the
soil
that
while
progress
has
been
made
in
our
knowledge
of
all
classes
of
materials
for
structures
very
little
has
been
done
which
leads
to
any
real
knowledge
of
the
material
on
which
the
foundation
rests
for
instance
it
is
inconceivable
that
or
tons
may
sometimes
be
allowed
on
a
square
foot
of
soft
clay
while
the
load
on
firm
gravel
is
limited
to
from
to
tons
the
writer
practical
observations
have
convinced
him
that
it
is
frequently
much
safer
to
put
four
times
tons
on
a
square
foot
of
gravel
than
it
is
to
put
of
tons
on
a
square
foot
of
soft
clay
in
connection
with
the
bearing
power
of
soil
the
writer
also
believes
that
too
little
study
has
been
given
to
the
questions
of
the
lateral
pressure
of
earth
and
he
desires
to
quote
here
from
some
experiments
described
in
a
book
f
published
in
england
in
to
which
his
attention
has
recently
been
called
this
book
appears
to
have
been
intended
for
young
people
but
it
is
of
interest
to
note
the
following
quotations
from
a
chapter
entitled
sand
this
chapter
begins
by
stating
that
during
the
course
of
a
lecture
on
the
suez
canal
by
john
pepper
which
was
delivered
nightly
by
him
at
the
polytechnic
institute
in
london
he
illustrated
his
lecture
by
some
experiments
designed
to
exhibit
certain
properties
of
sand
which
had
reference
to
the
construction
of
the
suez
canal
and
it
is
stated
that
though
the
properties
in
question
were
by
no
means
to
be
classed
among
recent
discoveries
the
experiments
were
novel
in
form
and
served
to
interest
the
public
audience
further
quotation
follows
when
the
suez
canal
was
projected
many
prophesied
evil
to
the
undertaking
from
the
sand
in
the
desert
being
drifted
by
the
wind
into
the
canal
and
others
were
apprehensive
that
where
the
canal
was
cut
through
the
sand
the
bottom
would
be
pushed
up
by
the
pressure
on
the
banks
the
principle
of
lateral
pressure
may
now
be
strikingly
illustrated
by
taking
an
american
wooden
pail
and
having
previously
cut
a
large
circular
hole
in
the
bottom
this
is
now
covered
with
fine
tissue
paper
which
should
be
carefully
pasted
on
to
prevent
the
particles
of
sand
from
flowing
through
the
small
openings
between
the
paper
and
the
wood
and
being
placed
upright
and
rapidly
filled
with
sand
it
may
be
carried
about
by
the
handle
without
the
slightest
fear
of
the
weight
of
the
sand
breaking
through
the
thin
medium
probably
one
of
the
most
convincing
experiments
is
that
which
may
be
performed
with
a
cylindrical
tube
in
long
and
in
in
diameter
open
at
both
ends
a
piece
of
tissue
paper
is
carefully
pasted
on
one
end
so
that
when
dry
no
cracks
or
interstices
are
left
the
tube
is
filled
with
dry
sand
to
a
height
of
say
in
in
the
upper
part
is
inserted
a
solid
plug
of
wood
in
long
and
of
the
same
or
very
nearly
the
same
diameter
as
the
inside
of
the
tube
so
that
it
will
move
freely
up
and
down
like
the
piston
of
an
air
pump
the
tube
sand
and
piston
being
arranged
as
described
may
now
be
held
by
an
assistant
and
the
demonstrator
taking
a
sledge
hammer
may
proceed
to
strike
steadily
on
the
end
of
the
piston
and
although
the
paper
will
bulge
out
a
little
the
force
of
the
blow
will
not
break
it
if
the
assistant
holding
the
tube
allows
it
to
jerk
or
rebound
after
each
blow
of
the
hammer
the
paper
may
break
because
air
and
sand
are
driven
down
by
the
succeeding
blow
and
therefore
it
must
be
held
steadily
so
that
the
piston
bears
fairly
on
the
sand
each
time
a
still
more
conclusive
and
striking
experiment
may
be
shown
with
a
framework
of
metal
constructed
to
represent
a
pail
the
sides
of
which
are
closed
up
by
pasting
sheets
of
tissue
paper
inside
and
over
the
lower
part
as
before
demonstrated
when
a
quantity
of
sand
is
poured
into
the
pail
the
tissue
paper
casing
at
the
bottom
does
not
break
but
if
a
sufficient
quantity
is
used
the
sides
formed
of
tissue
paper
bulge
out
and
usually
give
way
in
consequence
of
the
lateral
pressure
exerted
by
the
particles
of
sand
the
writer
has
made
the
second
experiment
noted
with
special
apparatus
and
finds
that
with
tissue
paper
over
the
bottom
of
a
pipe
in
long
about
in
of
sand
will
stand
the
blow
of
a
heavy
sledge
hammer
transmitted
through
a
wooden
piston
at
least
once
and
sometimes
two
or
three
times
while
heavy
blows
given
with
a
lighter
hammer
have
no
effect
at
all
that
this
is
not
due
in
any
large
measure
to
inertia
can
be
shown
by
the
fact
that
more
than
lb
can
safely
be
put
on
top
of
the
wooden
piston
it
can
not
be
accounted
for
entirely
by
the
friction
as
the
removal
of
the
paper
allows
the
sand
to
drop
in
a
mass
the
explanation
is
that
the
pressure
is
transmitted
laterally
to
the
sides
and
as
the
friction
is
directly
proportional
to
the
pressure
the
load
or
effect
of
the
blow
is
carried
by
the
proportional
increase
in
the
friction
and
any
diaphragm
which
will
carry
the
direct
bottom
load
will
not
have
its
stresses
largely
increased
by
any
greater
loading
on
top
the
writer
believes
that
experiments
will
show
that
in
a
the
tendency
will
be
for
the
sides
to
burst
rather
than
the
bottom
and
that
the
outflow
from
an
orifice
at
or
near
the
bottom
is
not
either
greatly
retarded
or
accelerated
by
ordinary
pressure
on
top
the
occurrence
of
abnormal
voids
however
causes
the
sand
to
be
displaced
into
them
the
important
consideration
of
this
paper
is
that
all
the
experiments
and
observations
noted
point
conclusively
to
the
fact
that
pressure
is
transmitted
laterally
through
ground
most
probably
along
or
nearly
parallel
to
the
angles
of
repose
or
in
cases
of
rock
or
stiff
material
along
a
line
which
until
more
conclusive
experiments
are
made
may
be
taken
as
a
mean
between
the
horizontal
and
vertical
or
approximately
degrees
there
is
no
reason
to
believe
that
this
is
not
the
case
throughout
the
entire
mass
of
the
earth
that
each
cubic
foot
or
yard
or
mile
is
supported
or
in
turn
supports
its
neighboring
equivalent
along
such
lines
the
theory
is
not
a
new
one
and
its
field
is
too
large
to
encompass
within
the
limits
of
a
single
paper
but
for
practical
purposes
and
within
the
limited
areas
to
which
we
must
necessarily
be
confined
the
writer
believes
it
can
be
established
beyond
controversy
as
true
certain
it
is
that
no
one
has
yet
found
in
ground
free
from
water
pressure
or
abnormal
conditions
any
evidence
of
greater
pressure
at
the
bottom
of
a
deep
shaft
or
tunnel
than
that
near
the
surface
pressures
due
to
the
widening
of
mines
beyond
the
limits
of
safety
must
not
be
taken
as
a
controversion
of
this
statement
as
all
arches
have
limits
of
safety
more
especially
if
the
useless
material
below
the
theoretical
intrados
is
only
partly
supported
or
is
allowed
to
be
suspended
from
the
natural
arch
the
writer
believes
also
that
the
question
of
confined
foundations
in
contradistinction
to
that
of
the
spreading
of
foundations
may
be
worthy
of
full
discussion
as
it
applies
to
safe
and
economical
construction
and
he
offers
without
special
comment
the
following
observations
he
has
found
that
in
soft
ground
results
are
often
obtained
with
small
open
caissons
sunk
to
a
depth
of
a
few
feet
and
cleaned
out
and
filled
with
concrete
which
offer
much
better
resistance
than
spreading
the
foundation
over
four
or
five
times
the
equivalent
area
he
has
found
that
small
steel
piles
and
from
cylinders
to
or
square
sunk
to
a
depth
of
only
or
below
adjacent
excavations
in
ordinary
sand
have
safely
resisted
loads
four
or
five
times
as
great
as
those
usually
allowed
he
believes
that
short
cylinders
cleaned
out
and
filled
with
concrete
or
of
short
steel
piling
with
the
surface
cleaned
out
to
a
reasonable
depth
and
filled
with
concrete
horizontally
reinforced
will
in
many
instances
give
as
good
results
as
and
in
most
cases
very
much
better
than
placing
the
foundation
on
an
equivalent
number
of
small
long
piles
or
a
proportionately
greater
spread
of
foundation
area
the
idea
being
that
the
transmission
of
pressure
to
the
sides
of
the
will
not
only
confine
the
side
thrust
but
will
also
transfer
the
loading
in
mass
to
a
greater
depth
where
the
resistance
to
lateral
pressure
in
the
ground
will
be
more
stable
that
is
the
greater
depth
of
foundation
is
gained
without
the
increased
excessive
loading
or
necessity
for
deep
excavation
as
to
the
question
of
the
bearing
value
and
friction
on
piles
the
writer
believes
that
while
the
literature
on
engineering
is
full
of
experimental
data
relating
to
friction
on
caissons
there
is
little
to
show
the
real
value
of
friction
on
piles
the
assumption
generally
made
of
an
assumed
bearing
value
and
the
deduction
therefrom
of
a
value
for
the
skin
friction
is
fallacious
distinction
also
is
not
made
but
should
be
clearly
drawn
between
skin
friction
pure
and
simple
on
smooth
surfaces
and
the
friction
due
to
pressure
too
often
the
bearing
value
on
irregular
surfaces
as
well
as
the
bearing
due
to
taper
in
piles
and
lastly
the
resistance
offered
by
binding
enter
into
the
determination
of
skin
friction
formulas
the
essential
condition
of
sinking
a
caisson
is
keeping
it
plumb
and
binding
which
is
another
way
of
writing
increased
bearing
value
will
oftentimes
be
fatal
to
success
the
writer
believes
that
a
series
of
observations
on
caissons
sunk
plumb
under
homogeneous
conditions
of
ground
and
superficial
smoothness
will
show
a
proportional
increase
of
skin
friction
per
square
foot
average
for
each
increase
in
the
size
of
caissons
as
well
as
for
increase
of
depth
in
the
sinking
up
to
certain
points
where
it
may
finally
become
constant
as
will
be
shown
later
the
determination
of
the
actual
friction
or
coefficient
of
friction
between
the
surfaces
of
the
pile
and
the
material
it
encounters
is
not
difficult
to
determine
in
sand
it
is
approximately
of
the
pressure
for
reasonably
smooth
iron
or
steel
and
of
the
pressure
for
ordinary
wood
surfaces
if
for
instance
a
long
shaft
be
withdrawn
vertically
from
moulding
sand
the
hole
may
remain
indefinitely
as
long
as
water
does
not
get
into
it
or
it
does
not
dry
out
this
is
due
to
the
tendency
of
the
sand
to
arch
itself
horizontally
over
small
areas
the
same
operation
can
not
be
performed
on
dry
sand
as
the
arching
properties
while
protecting
the
pile
from
excessive
pressure
due
to
excessive
length
will
not
prevent
the
loose
sand
immediately
surrounding
the
pile
from
exerting
a
constant
pressure
against
the
pile
and
it
is
of
this
pressure
that
may
be
taken
as
the
real
value
of
skin
friction
on
piles
in
dry
sand
in
soft
clays
or
peats
which
are
displaced
by
driving
the
tendency
of
this
material
to
flow
back
into
the
original
space
causes
pressure
of
which
the
friction
will
be
a
measured
percentage
in
this
case
however
the
friction
itself
between
the
material
and
the
clays
or
peat
is
usually
very
much
less
than
and
it
is
for
this
reason
that
piles
of
almost
indefinite
length
may
be
driven
in
materials
of
this
character
without
offering
sufficient
resistance
to
be
depended
on
as
long
as
no
good
bearing
ground
is
found
at
the
point
if
this
material
is
under
water
and
is
so
soft
as
to
be
considered
the
pressure
per
square
foot
will
increase
in
diminishing
proportion
to
the
depth
and
the
pressure
per
area
will
soon
approach
and
become
a
constant
due
to
the
resistance
offered
by
the
lateral
arching
of
the
solid
material
whereas
in
large
circular
caissons
or
caisson
shafts
where
the
horizontal
arching
effect
is
virtually
destroyed
or
at
least
rendered
until
a
great
depth
is
reached
the
pressure
must
necessarily
vary
under
these
conditions
proportionately
to
the
depth
and
size
of
the
caisson
in
material
on
the
other
hand
in
large
caisson
shafts
especially
those
which
are
square
the
pressure
at
the
top
due
to
the
solid
material
will
also
increase
proportionately
to
the
depth
as
already
explained
in
connection
with
the
pressures
of
earth
against
sheeting
and
retaining
walls
the
writer
believes
that
the
pressure
on
these
surfaces
may
be
determined
with
reasonable
accuracy
by
the
formulas
already
given
in
this
paper
and
with
these
pressures
multiplied
by
the
coefficient
of
friction
determined
by
the
simplest
experiment
on
the
ground
results
may
be
obtained
which
will
closely
approximate
the
actual
friction
on
caissons
at
given
depths
the
friction
on
caissons
which
is
usually
given
at
from
to
lb
per
sq
is
frequently
assumed
to
be
the
same
on
piles
in
or
less
in
diameter
whereas
the
pressures
on
these
surfaces
as
shown
are
in
no
way
comparable
the
following
notes
and
observations
are
given
in
connection
with
the
skin
friction
and
the
bearing
value
of
piles
the
writer
has
in
his
possession
a
copy
of
an
official
print
which
was
recently
furnished
to
bidders
in
connection
with
the
foundation
for
a
large
public
building
in
new
york
city
the
experiments
were
made
on
good
sand
at
a
depth
of
approximately
below
water
and
below
an
adjacent
excavation
in
this
instance
a
pipe
was
sunk
to
the
depth
stated
cleaned
out
and
a
piston
connected
to
a
pipe
was
inserted
and
the
ground
at
the
bottom
of
the
pipe
subjected
to
a
loading
approximating
tons
per
sq
after
an
initial
settlement
of
nearly
there
was
no
further
settlement
over
an
extended
period
although
the
load
of
tons
per
sq
was
continued
in
connection
with
some
recent
underpinning
work
hollow
cylindrical
piles
long
were
sunk
to
a
depth
of
with
an
ordinary
being
excavated
as
driven
these
piles
were
then
filled
with
concrete
and
subjected
to
a
loading
in
some
cases
approximating
tons
after
a
settlement
ranging
from
to
no
further
settlement
took
place
although
the
loading
was
maintained
for
a
considerable
period
in
connection
with
some
other
pile
work
the
writer
has
seen
a
pipe
in
thick
below
the
bottom
of
an
open
cylinder
at
a
depth
of
about
sustain
in
gravel
and
sand
a
load
approximating
tons
when
cleaned
out
to
within
of
the
bottom
he
has
seen
other
cylindrical
piles
with
a
bearing
ring
of
not
more
than
in
resting
on
gravel
at
a
depth
of
from
to
cleaned
out
practically
to
the
bottom
sustain
a
measured
load
of
tons
without
settlement
as
to
skin
friction
in
sand
a
case
came
under
his
observation
wherein
a
hollow
cylindrical
pile
which
had
stood
for
days
at
a
depth
of
about
in
the
sand
was
cleaned
out
to
its
bottom
and
subjected
to
hydraulic
pressure
measured
by
a
gauge
and
sunk
into
the
sand
without
any
pressure
being
registered
on
the
gauge
it
should
be
explained
however
that
the
gauge
could
be
subjected
to
a
pressure
of
equal
to
a
total
pressure
of
lb
on
the
piston
of
the
jack
without
registering
which
corresponded
assuming
it
all
as
skin
friction
to
a
maximum
of
not
more
than
lb
per
sq
but
it
should
be
noted
that
this
included
bearing
value
as
well
and
that
the
pressure
was
very
far
from
in
all
probability
at
the
beginning
of
the
test
in
the
case
of
the
california
wells
driven
by
the
board
of
water
supply
on
long
island
the
writer
is
informed
that
one
of
these
tubes
in
in
diameter
was
sunk
to
a
depth
of
ft
in
doing
this
work
the
pile
was
excavated
below
the
footing
with
a
sand
pump
and
was
then
sunk
by
hydraulic
pressure
assuming
the
maximum
capacity
of
the
jacks
at
tons
which
is
not
probable
the
skin
friction
could
not
have
amounted
to
more
than
lb
per
sq
ft
it
can
not
be
assumed
in
this
case
that
the
excavation
of
the
material
below
the
pile
relieved
the
skin
itself
of
some
of
its
friction
as
the
operation
consumed
more
than
weeks
and
even
if
excess
material
was
removed
it
is
certain
that
a
large
percentage
of
it
would
have
had
time
to
adjust
itself
before
the
operation
was
completed

in
connection
with
this
the
writer
may
call
attention
to
the
fact
that
piles
driven
in
silt
along
the
north
river
and
in
soft
material
at
other
places
are
sometimes
in
length
and
even
then
do
not
offer
sufficient
resistance
to
be
depended
on
for
loading
this
is
due
to
the
fact
that
the
end
of
the
pile
does
not
bear
in
good
material
the
relation
between
bearing
value
and
skin
friction
on
a
pile
where
the
end
bearing
is
in
good
material
is
well
shown
by
a
case
where
a
wooden
pile
g
struck
solid
material
was
distorted
under
the
continual
blows
of
the
hammer
and
was
afterward
exposed
it
is
also
shown
in
the
case
of
a
california
pile

a
chenoweth
pile
which
was
an

one
driven
by

this
pile
after
getting
into
hard
material
was
subjected
to
the
blow
of
a
hammer
falling
the
full
length
of
the
and
the
only
result
was
to
shatter
the
head
of
the
pile
and
not
cause
further

chenoweth
has
stated
to
the
writer
that
he
has
found
material
so
compact
that
it
could
not
be
penetrated
with
a
solid
pile
either
with
or
without
jetting
which
is
in
line
with
the
writer
experience
the
writer
believes
that
the
foregoing
notes
will
show
conclusively
that
the
factor
to
be
sought
in
pile
work
is
bearing
value
rather
than
depth
or
skin
friction
and
however
valuable
skin
friction
may
be
in
the
larger
caissons
it
can
not
be
depended
on
in
the
case
of
small
piles
except
in
values
ranging
from
to
lb

in
conclusion
he
desires
to

the
following

lastly
he
desires
especially
to
thank

the

for
men
and
material
with
which
to
make
the
experiments
and
without
whose
it
would
have
been
impracticable
for
the
writer
to
have
made
them
throughout
this
paper
the
writer
has
endeavored
as
far
as
possible
to
deduce
from
his
observations
and
from
the
observations
of
others
as
far
as
he
has
been
able
to
obtain
them
practical
data
and
formulas
which
may
be
of
use
in
establishing
the
relationship
between
the
pressure
resistance
and
stability
of
earths
and
while
he
does
not
wish
to
dictate
the
character
of
the
discussion
he
does
ask
that
those
who
have
made
observations
of
a
similar
character
or
who
have
available
data
will
as
far
as
possible
contribute
the
same
to
this
discussion
it
is
only
by
such
observations
and
experiments
and
deductions
therefrom
that
engineers
may
obtain
a
better
knowledge
of
the
handling
of
such
materials
the
writer
believes
that
too
much
has
been
taken
for
granted
in
connection
with
earth
pressures
and
resistance
and
that
far
too
often
observations
of
the
results
of
natural
laws
have
been
set
down
as
phenomena
he
believes
that
both
in
experimenting
and
observing
the
engineer
will
frequently
find
what
is
being
looked
for
or
expected
and
will
fail
to
see
the
obvious
alternative
he
may
add
that
his
own
experiments
and
observations
may
be
criticized
for
the
same
reason
and
he
asks
therefore
that
all
possible
light
be
thrown
on
this
subject
a
comparative
study
of
much
of
our
expert
testimony
or
of
the
plans
of
almost
any
of
the
structures
designed
in
connection
with
their
bearing
upon
earth
or
resistance
to
earth
pressure
will
show
that
under
the
present
methods
of
interpretation
of
the
underlying
principles
governing
the
calculations
and
designs
relating
to
such
structures
the
results
vary
far
too
widely
too
much
is
left
to
the
judgment
of
the
engineer
and
too
frequently
no
fixed
standards
can
be
found
for
some
of
the
most
essential
conditions
until
the
engineer
can
say
with
certainty
that
his
calculations
are
reasonably
based
on
facts
he
is
forced
to
admit
that
his
design
must
be
lacking
either
in
the
elements
of
safety
on
the
one
hand
or
of
economy
on
the
other
and
until
he
can
give
to
his
client
a
full
measure
of
both
these
factors
in
fair
proportion
he
can
not
justly
claim
that
his
profession
has
reached
its
full
development

of
it
or
will
not
read
it
thoroughly
for
instance
at
the
beginning
the
author
cites
several
experiments
in
which
considerable
force
is
required
to
start
the
lifting
of
a
weight
or
plunger
in
sand
and
water
and
much
less
after
the
start
this
reminds
the
speaker
of
the
time
when
as
a
schoolboy
he
tried
to
pick
up
stones
from
the
bottom
of
the
river
and
was
told
that
the
suction
was
caused
by
atmospheric
pressure
the
inference
is
that
tunnels
in
sand
are
not
in
any
danger
of
rising
even
though
they
are
lighter
than
water
toward
the
end
of
the
paper
however
the
author
states
that
tunnels
should
be
weighted
but
he
rather
spoils
this
by
stating
that
they
should
be
weighted
only
enough
to
overcome
the
actual
water
pressure
that
is
between
the
voids
of
the
sand
it
seems
to
the
speaker
that
the
only
really
safe
way
is
to
make
the
tunnel
at
least
as
heavy
as
the
water
displaced
in
order
to
prevent
it
from
coming
up
and
to
take
other
measures
to
prevent
it
from
going
down
the
city
of
toronto
canada
formerly
pumped
its
water
supply
through
a
iron
pipe
buried
in
the
sand
under
toronto
bay
and
then
under
toronto
island
with
an
intake
in
the
deep
water
of
the
lake
during
a
storm
a
mass
of
seaweed
was
washed
against
the
intake
completely
blocking
it
and
although
the
man
at
the
pumping
station
knew
that
something
was
wrong
he
continued
to
pump
until
the
water
was
drawn
out
of
the
pipe
with
the
result
that
about
half
a
mile
of
the
conduit
started
to
rise
and
then
broke
at
several
places
thus
allowing
it
to
fill
with
water
eventually
the
city
went
down
to
under
the
bay
for
its
water
tunnel
another
reason
for
calling
this
paper
dangerous
for
beginners
is
that
it
is
improbable
that
experienced
engineers
or
contractors
will
omit
the
bracing
at
the
bottom
although
since
the
paper
was
printed
a
glaring
instance
has
occurred
where
comparatively
little
bracing
was
put
in
the
bottom
of
a
cut
the
result
being
a
bad
from
the
bottom
although
all
the
top
braces
remained
in
place
most
engineers
will
agree
that
nearly
every
crib
which
has
failed
slipped
out
from
the
bottom
and
did
not
turn
over
the
objection
to
the
angle
of
repose
is
that
it
is
not
possible
to
ascertain
it
for
any
material
deposited
by
nature
it
could
probably
be
ascertained
for
a
sand
bank
deposited
by
man
but
not
for
an
excavation
to
be
made
in
the
ground
for
it
is
known
that
nearly
all
earth
has
been
deposited
under
great
pressure
and
is
likely
to
be
cemented
together
by
clay
loam
roots
trees
boulders
and
differs
in
character
every
few
feet
a
deep
vertical
cut
can
often
be
made
even
in
new
york
quicksand
from
which
the
water
has
been
drawn
and
if
not
subjected
to
jars
water
this
material
will
stand
for
considerable
time
and
then
come
down
like
an
avalanche
killing
any
one
in
its
way
in
such
cases
very
little
bracing
would
prevent
the
slide
from
starting
provided
rain
did
not
loosen
the
material
the
author
of
course
treats
dry
and
wet
materials
differently
but
there
are
very
few
places
where
dry
material
is
not
likely
to
become
wet
before
the
excavation
is
completed
in
caisson
work
if
the
caisson
can
be
kept
absolutely
plumb
it
can
be
sunk
without
having
to
overcome
much
friction
while
on
the
other
hand
if
it
is
not
kept
plumb
the
material
is
more
or
less
disturbed
and
begins
to
bind
causing
considerable
friction
the
author
claims
that
the
pressure
does
not
increase
with
the
depth
but
all
caisson
men
will
probably
remember
that
the
friction
to
be
overcome
per
square
foot
of
surface
increases
with
the
depth
in
calculating
retaining
walls
many
engineers
add
the
weight
of
the
soil
to
the
water
and
calculate
for
from
to
lb
per
cu
ft
the
speaker
is
satisfied
that
in
the
new
york
quicksand
it
is
sufficient
to
use
the
weight
of
the
water
only
if
the
sand
increased
the
side
pressure
above
the
water
pressure
engineers
would
expect
to
use
more
compressed
air
to
hold
it
back
while
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
air
pressure
used
seldom
varies
much
from
that
called
for
by
the
hydrostatic
head
although
allowance
for
water
pressure
is
sufficient
for
designing
retaining
walls
in
new
york
quicksand
it
is
far
from
sufficient
in
certain
silty
materials
for
instance
in
maryland
a
excavated
to
a
depth
of
in
silt
and
water
had
the
bottom
shoved
in
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
the
waling
pieces
were
apart
vertically
at
the
top
and
at
the
bottom
and
were
braced
with
by
timbers
every
horizontally
the
walings
split
and
the
cut
into
the
waling
pieces
from
to
in
in
other
words
the
pressure
seemed
to
be
almost
irresistible
this
is
quite
a
contrast
to
certain
excavations
in
brooklyn
which
without
any
bracing
whatever
were
safely
carried
down
any
engineer
who
tries
to
guess
at
the
angle
of
repose
and
from
the
resulting
calculations
economizes
on
his
bottom
struts
will
find
that
sooner
or
later
an
accident
on
one
job
will
cause
enough
loss
of
life
and
money
to
pay
for
conservative
timbers
for
the
rest
of
his
life
so
much
for
side
pressures
as
to
the
pressure
in
the
roof
of
a
tunnel
probably
every
engineer
will
agree
that
almost
any
material
except
unfrozen
water
will
tend
to
arch
more
or
less
but
how
much
it
is
impossible
to
say
it
is
doubtful
whether
any
experienced
engineer
would
ever
try
to
carry
all
the
weight
over
the
roof
except
in
the
case
of
and
even
then
he
would
have
to
make
his
own
assumption
which
sounds
more
polite
than
guess
the
author
has
stated
however
that
when
the
tunnel
roof
and
sides
are
in
place
no
further
trouble
need
be
feared
on
the
contrary
in
the
canadian
pacific
railroad
built
a
tunnel
through
clayey
material
and
lined
it
with
ordinary
by
timber
framing
about
or
apart
after
the
tunnel
was
completed
it
collapsed
it
was
and
lined
with
by
timbers
side
by
side
and
it
collapsed
again
then
the
tunnel
was
abandoned
and
for
some
years
the
track
carried
around
on
a
curve
was
used
until
a
new
tunnel
was
built
farther
in
this
trouble
could
have
been
caused
either
by
the
sliding
or
swelling
of
the
material
and
the
speaker
is
inclined
to
believe
that
it
was
caused
by
swelling
for
it
is
known
of
course
that
most
material
has
been
deposited
by
nature
under
great
pressure
and
by
excavating
in
certain
materials
the
air
and
moisture
would
cause
those
materials
to
swell
and
become
an
irresistible
force
to
carry
the
load
meem
prefers
to
rely
on
the
points
of
the
piles
rather
than
the
side
friction
in
such
cases
the
pile
would
act
as
a
post
and
would
probably
fail
when
ordinarily
loaded
unless
firmly
supported
at
the
sides
the
speaker
has
seen
piles
driven
from
to
in
which
offered
almost
no
resistance
and
yet
a
few
days
later
they
would
sustain
tons
each
no
one
would
dream
of
putting
tons
on
a
pile
resting
on
rock
if
it
were
not
adequately
supported
it
is
the
speaker
opinion
that
bracing
should
not
be
omitted
for
either
piles
or
charles

last
experiment
with
the
hydraulic
chambers

meem
states
that
after
letting
the

at
the
piston
came
up
this
suggests
that
the
piston
might
have
been
raised
at
a
much
lower
pressure
if
it
had
been
allowed
to
stand
long
enough
the
depth
and
coarseness
of
the
sand
were
not
varied
to
ascertain
whether
any
relation
exists
between
them
and
the
pressure
required
to
lift
the
piston
if
the
pressure
varied
with
the
depth
of
sand
it
would
indicate
that
the
reduction
was
due
to
the
resistance
of
the
water
when
finely
divided
by
the
sand
if
it
varied
with
the
coarseness
of
the
sand
as
it
undoubtedly
would
especially
if
the
sand
grains
were
increased
to
spheres
in
in
diameter
it
would
show
that
it
was
independent
of
the
voids
in
the
sand
but
dependent
on
dividing
the
water
into
thin
films
the
speaker
believes
that
the
greater
part
of
the
reduction
of
pressure
on
the
bottom
of
the
piston
might
be
better
explained
by
the
viscosity
of
the
water
than
to
assume
that
a
considerable
part
of
the
plunger
is
not
in
contact
with
it
the
water
being
divided
by
fine
sand
into
very
thin
films
has
a
tensile
strength
which
is
capable
of
resisting
the
pressure
for
at
least
a
limited
time
if
the
water
is
capable
of
exerting
its
full
hydrostatic
pressure
through
the
sand
the
total
pressure
would
be
the
full
hydrostatic
pressure
on
the
bottom
of
the
piston
where
in
contact
and
where
separated
from
it
by
a
grain
of
sand
the
pressure
would
be
decreased
only
by
the
weight
of
the
grain
if
a
large
proportion
of
the
top
area
of
a
grain
is
in
contact
as
assumed
by
the
author
this
reduction
of
pressure
would
be
very
small
a
correct
interpretation
can
be
obtained
only
after
more
complete
experiments
have
been
made
for
horizontal
pressures
exerted
by
saturated
sands
on
vertical
walls
it
has
not
been
demonstrated
that
anything
should
be
deducted
from
full
water
pressure
no
matter
how
much
of
the
area
is
in
direct
contact
with
the
sand
rather
than
the
water
the
full
water
pressure
would
be
transmitted
through
each
sand
grain
from
its
other
side
and
if
necessary
from
and
through
many
other
grains
which
may
be
in
turn
in
contact
with
it
the
pressure
on
such
a
wall
will
be
water
pressure
over
its
entire
surface
and
in
addition
the
thrust
of
the
sand
after
correcting
for
its
loss
of
weight
in
the
water
the
fact
that
small
cavities
may
be
excavated
from
the
sides
of
trenches
or
tunnels
back
of
the
sheeting
proves
only
that
there
is
a
local
temporary
arching
of
the
material
or
that
the
cohesion
of
the
particles
is
sufficient
to
withstand
the
stress
temporarily
or
that
there
is
a
combination
of
cohesion
and
arching
the
possibility
of
making
such
excavations
does
not
prove
that
pressure
does
not
exist
at
such
points
that
sand
or
earth
will
arch
under
certain
conditions
has
long
been
an
accepted
fact
the
sand
arches
experimented
with
developed
their
strength
only
after
considerable
yielding
and
therefore
give
no
index
of
the
distribution
or
intensity
of
stress
before
such

this

is
to
be
characterized
by
superlatives
parts
of
it
are
believed
to
be
exceptionally
good
while
other
parts
are
considered
equally
dangerous
the
author
experimental
work
is
extremely
interesting
and
the
writer
believes
the
results
obtained
to
be
of
great
value
but
the
analytical
work
both
mathematical
and
logical
is
emphatically
questioned
the
writer
believes
that
in
the
design
of
permanent
structures
consideration
of
arch
action
should
not
be
included
at
least
not
until
much
more
information
has
been
obtained
he
also
believes
that
the
design
of
temporary
structures
with
this
inclusion
is
actually
dangerous
in
some
instances
and
takes
the
liberty
of
citing
the
following
statement
by
the
author
with
regard
to
his
first
experiment
about
an
hour
after
the
superimposed
load
had
been
removed
the
writer
jostled
the
box
with
his
foot
sufficiently
to
dislodge
some
of
the
exposed
sand
when
the
arch
at
once
collapsed
and
the
bottom
fell
to
the
ground
the
writer
emphatically
questions
the
author
ideas
as
to
the
thickness
of
key
which
should
be
allowed
over
tunnels
believing
that
conditions
within
an
earth
mass
except
in
very
rare
instances
are
such
that
true
arch
action
will
seldom
take
place
to
any
definite
extent
through
any
considerable
depths
furthermore
the
reason
for
bisecting
the
angle
between
the
vertical
and
the
angle
of
repose
of
the
material
when
he
undertakes
to
determine
the
thickness
of
key
is
not
obvious
this
assumption
is
shown
to
be
absurd
when
carried
to
either
limit
for
when
the
angle
of
repose
equals
zero
as
is
the
case
with
water
this
method
would
give
a
definite
thickness
of
key
while
there
can
be
absolutely
no
arch
action
possible
in
such
a
case
and
when
the
angle
of
repose
is
as
may
be
assumed
in
the
case
of
rock
this
method
would
give
an
infinite
thickness
of
key
which
is
again
seen
to
be
absurd
it
would
seem
as
if
altogether
too
many
unknowable
conditions
had
been
assumed
in
any
case
no
arch
action
can
be
brought
into
play
until
a
certain
amount
of
settlement
has
taken
place
so
as
to
bring
the
particles
into
closer
contact
and
in
such
a
way
that
the
internal
stresses
are
practically
those
only
of
compression
and
the
shearing
stresses
are
within
the
limits
possible
for
the
material
in
question
the
author
has
repeatedly
made
assumptions
which
are
not
borne
out
by
the
application
of
his
mathematical
formulas
to
actual
extreme
conditions
this
method
of
application
to
limiting
conditions
is
concededly
sometimes
faulty
but
the
writer
believes
that
no
earth
pressure
theory
or
one
concerning
arch
action
can
be
considered
as
satisfactory
which
does
not
apply
equally
well
to
hydraulic
pressure
problems
when
the
proper
assumptions
are
made
as
to
the
factors
for
friction
cohesion
etc
for
example
when
the
angle
of
repose
is
considered
as
zero
in
the
author
first
formula
for
the
value
becomes
whereas
it
should
depend
solely
on
the
depth
which
does
not
enter
the
formula
and
not
at
all
on
the
width
of
opening
which
is
thus
included
the
author
has
given
no
experiments
to
prove
his
statement
that
the
arch
thrust
is
greater
in
dryer
sand
and
the
accuracy
of
the
statement
is
questioned
again
no
reason
is
apparent
for
assuming
the
direction
of
the
rakers
in
fig
as
that
of
the
angle
of
repose
the
writer
can
not
see
why
that
particular
angle
is
repeatedly
used
when
almost
any
other
would
give
results
of
a
similar
kind
the
author
has
made
no
experiments
which
show
any
connection
between
the
angle
of
repose
as
he
interprets
it
and
the
lines
of
arch
action
which
he
assumes
to
exist
with
regard
to
the
illustration
of
the
condition
which
is
thought
to
exist
when
the
material
is
composed
of
large
bowling
balls
supposedly
all
of
the
same
size
the
writer
believes
the
conclusion
to
be
erroneous
and
that
this
can
be
readily
seen
by
inspection
of
a
diagram
in
which
such
balls
are
represented
as
forming
a
pile
similar
to
the
pile
of
shells
of
the
algebras
in
the
diagram
of
which
a
pile
of
three
shells
resting
on
the
base
has
been
omitted
it
is
then
seen
that
unless
the
pressures
at
an
angle
of
with
the
horizontal
are
sufficient
to
produce
frictional
resistance
of
a
very
large
amount
the
balls
will
roll
and
instantly
break
the
arch
action
suggested
by
the
author
consequently
an
almost
infinitesimal
settlement
of
the
centering
may
cause
the
complete
destruction
of
an
arch
of
earth
the
author
logic
is
believed
to
be
entirely
faulty
in
many
cases
because
he
repeatedly
makes
assumptions
which
are
not
in
accordance
with
demonstrated
fact
and
finally
sums
up
the
results
by
the
statement
it
is
conceded
line
for
example
when
the
writer
for
one
has
not
even
conceded
the
accuracy
of
the
assumptions
for
instance
the
author
theory
that
pressures
against
retaining
walls
are
a
maximum
at
the
top
and
decrease
to
zero
at
the
bottom
is
in
absolute
contradiction
to
the
results
of
experiments
conducted
on
a
large
scale
by
the
writer
on
the
new
reinforced
concrete
retaining
wall
near
the
george
ferry
on
staten
island
new
york
city
which
will
soon
be
published
and
in
which
the
usual
law
of
increase
of
lateral
pressure
with
depth
is
believed
to
be
demonstrated
beyond
question
it
must
be
conceded
that
a
considerable
arch
action
actually
exists
in
many
cases
but
it
should
be
equally
conceded
by
the
advocates
of
the
existence
of
such
action
that
changes
in
humidity
due
to
moving
water
vibration
and
appreciable
viscosity
will
invariably
destroy
this
action
in
time
in
consequence
the
author
reasoning
in
regard
to
the
pressures
against
the
faces
of
retaining
walls
is
believed
to
be
open
to
grave
question
as
to
accuracy
of
assumption
method
and
conclusion
the
author
is
correct
in
so
far
as
he
assumes
that
the
character
of
the
stresses
due
to
the
thrust
of
the
material
will
not
change
if
bracing
should
be
substituted
for
the
material
in
the
area
designated
by
him
provided
he
makes
the
further
assumption
that
absolutely
no
motion
however
infinitesimal
has
taken
place
meantime
but
unless
such
motion
has
actually
taken
place
no
arch
action
can
have
developed
an
arch
thrust
can
result
only
with
true
arch
action
that
is
with
stable
abutments
and
the
mass
stressed
wholly
in
compression
with
corresponding
shortening
of
the
arch
line
the
arch
thrust
must
be
proportional
to
the
elastic
deformation
shortening
of
the
arch
line
if
any
such
arch
as
is
shown
in
fig
is
assumed
to
carry
the
whole
of
the
weight
of
material
above
it
that
assumed
arch
must
relieve
all
the
assumed
arches
below
therefore
each
of
the
assumed
arches
can
carry
nothing
more
than
its
own
mass
otherwise
the
resulting
thrust
would
increase
with
the
depth
which
is
opposed
to
the
author
theory
turning
again
to
the
condition
that
each
arch
can
carry
only
its
own
weight
if
these
arches
are
assumed
of
thicknesses
proportional
to
the
distance
upward
from
the
bottom
of
the
wall
they
will
be
similar
figures
and
it
is
easily
demonstrated
that
the
thrust
will
then
be
uniform
in
amount
throughout
the
whole
height
of
the
wall
except
perhaps
at
the
very
top
this
condition
is
contrary
to
the
ideas
and
also
to
the
facts
as
demonstrated
by
the
writer
experiment
on
the
retaining
wall
at
george
consequently
the
statement
nor
can
anyone
doubt
that
the
top
timbers
are
stressed
more
heavily
than
those
at
the
bottom
is
emphatically
doubted
and
earnestly
denied
by
the
writer
furthermore
the
assumption
made
by
the
author
as
to
the
tendency
of
the
material
to
slide
so
as
to
cause
it
to
wedge
between
the
face
of
the
sheeting
and
some
plane
between
the
sheeting
and
the
plane
of
repose
is
considered
as
absolutely
unwarranted
and
consequently
the
whole
conclusion
is
believed
to
be
unjustified
nor
is
the
author
assumption
line
that
the
thrust
is
measured
by
its
weight
divided
by
the
tangent
of
the
angle
of
repose
at
all
obvious
the
author
presents
some
very
interesting
photographs
showing
the
natural
surface
slopes
of
various
materials
but
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
he
describes
these
slopes
as
having
been
produced
by
the
continual
slipping
down
of
particles
the
vast
difference
between
angles
of
repose
produced
in
this
manner
by
the
rolling
friction
of
particles
and
the
internal
angles
of
friction
which
must
be
used
in
all
investigations
has
been
repeatedly
called
to
the
attention
of
engineers
by
the
writer
h
the
writer
experiments
are
entirely
in
accord
with
those
of
the
author
in
which
the
latter
claims
to
demonstrate
that
earth
and
water
pressures
act
independently
of
each
other
and
the
writer
is
much
delighted
that
his
own
experiments
have
been
thus
confirmed
in
experiment
no
the
query
is
naturally
suggested
what
would
have
been
the
result
if
the
nuts
and
washers
had
first
been
tightened
and
water
then
added
although
the
writer
has
not
tried
the
experiment
he
is
rather
inclined
to
the
idea
that
the
arch
would
have
collapsed
with
regard
to
experiment
no
there
is
to
be
noted
an
interesting
possibility
of
its
application
to
the
theoretical
discussion
of
masonry
dams
in
which
films
of
water
are
assumed
to
exist
beneath
the
structure
or
in
crevices
or
cracks
of
capillary
dimensions
the
writer
has
always
considered
the
assumptions
made
by
many
designing
engineers
as
unnecessarily
conservative
in
regard
to
the
author
conclusions
from
experiment
no
it
should
be
noted
that
no
friction
can
exist
between
particles
of
sand
and
surrounding
water
unless
there
is
a
tendency
of
the
latter
to
move
and
that
water
in
motion
does
not
exert
pressures
equal
to
those
produced
when
in
a
static
condition
the
reduction
being
proportional
to
the
velocity
of
flow
the
author
conclusion
that
pressure
will
cause
the
quicksand
to
set
up
hydraulic
action
does
not
seem
to
have
been
demonstrated
by
his
experiments
but
to
be
only
his
theory
in
this
instance
the
results
of
the
writer
experiments
are
contrary
to
the
author
theory
and
conclusion
the
writer
will
heartily
add
his
protest
to
that
of
the
author
against
considering
masses
such
as
soupy
sands
soft
concrete
as
exerting
hydrostatic
pressure
due
to
their
weight
in
bulk
instead
of
to
the
specific
gravity
of
the
basic
liquid
again
similarly
hearty
concurrence
is
given
to
the
author
statement
if
the
solid
material
in
any
liquid
is
agitated
so
that
it
is
virtually
in
suspension
it
can
not
add
to
the
pressure
and
if
allowed
to
subside
it
acts
as
a
solid
independently
of
the
water
contained
with
it
although
the
water
may
change
somewhat
the
properties
of
the
material
by
increasing
or
changing
its
cohesion
angle
of
repose
etc
on
the
other
hand
it
is
believed
that
the
author
statement
as
to
the
tendency
of
marbles
to
arch
a
few
lines
above
the
one
last
quoted
should
be
qualified
by
the
addition
of
the
words
only
when
a
certain
amount
of
deflection
has
taken
place
so
as
to
bring
the
arch
into
action
again
on
the
following
page
a
somewhat
similar
qualification
should
be
added
to
the
sentence
referring
to
the
soft
clay
arch
that
it
would
stand
if
the
rods
supporting
the
intrados
of
the
arch
were
keyed
back
to
washers
covering
a
sufficiently
large
area
by
inserting
the
words
unless
creeping
pressures
such
as
those
encountered
by
the
writer
in
his
experiments
were
exceeded
the
writer
considers
as
very
doubtful
the
formula
for
x
which
is
the
same
as
that
for
already
discussed
the
author
statement
that
additional
will
under
certain
circumstances
lighten
the
load
on
the
structure
is
considered
subject
to
modification
by
some
such
clause
as
the
following
the
word
here
being
understood
to
mean
the
reduction
to
some
extent
of
what
would
be
the
total
pressure
due
to
the
combined
original
and
added
provided
no
arch
action
occurred
the
writer
is
in
entire
agreement
with
the
author
as
to
the
probability
that
water
is
often
cut
off
absolutely
from
its
source
of
pressure
with
the
attendant
results
described
by
the
author
and
again
that
too
little
attention
has
been
given
to
the
bearing
power
of
soil
with
the
author
accompanying
criticism
the
writer
can
not
see
however
where
the
author
experiments
demonstrate
his
statement
that
pressure
is
transmitted
laterally
through
ground
most
probably
along
or
nearly
parallel
to
the
angles
of
repose
or
any
of
the
conclusions
drawn
by
him
in
the
paragraph
which
contains
this
questionable
statement
again
the
writer
is
at
a
loss
as
to
how
to
interpret
the
statement
that
the
author
has
found
that
better
resistance
has
been
offered
by
small
open
caissons
sunk
to
a
depth
of
a
few
feet
and
cleaned
out
and
filled
with
concrete
than
by
spreading
the
foundation
over
four
or
five
times
the
equivalent
area
the
writer
agrees
with
the
author
in
the
majority
of
his
statements
as
to
the
bearing
value
and
friction
on
piles
but
believes
that
he
is
indulging
in
pure
theory
in
some
of
his
succeeding
remarks
wherein
he
ascribes
to
arch
action
the
results
which
he
believes
would
be
observed
if
a
long
shaft
be
withdrawn
vertically
from
moulding
sand
these
phenomena
would
be
due
rather
to
capillary
action
and
the
resulting
cohesion
naturally
the
writer
doubts
the
author
conclusions
as
to
the
pressure
at
the
top
of
large
square
caisson
shafts
when
he
states
that
the
pressure
at
the
top
will
increase
proportionately
to
the
depth
again
the
author
is
apparently
not
conversant
with
experiments
made
by
the
dock
department
of
new
york
city
concerning
piles
driven
in
the
hudson
river
silt
which
showed
that
a
single
heavily
loaded
pile
carried
downward
with
it
other
unloaded
piles
driven
considerable
distances
away
showing
that
it
was
not
the
pile
which
lacked
in
resistance
as
much
as
the
surrounding
earth
in
conclusion
the
writer
heartily
concurs
with
the
statement
that
too
much
has
been
taken
for
granted
in
connection
with
earth
pressures
and
resistance
and
he
is
sorry
to
be
forced
to
add
that
he
believes
the
author
to
be
open
to
the
criticism
which
he
himself
suggests
that
both
in
experimenting
and
observing
the
engineer
and
in
this
case
the
author
will
frequently
find
what
is
being
looked
for
or
expected
and
will
fail
to
see
the
obvious
alternative
francis
pruyn
am
soc
by
letter
mr
meem
should
be
congratulated
both
in
regard
to
the
highly
interesting
theories
which
he
advances
on
the
subject
of
sand
pressures
the
pressures
of
subaqueous
material
and
on
his
interesting
experiments
in
connection
therewith
the
experiment
in
which
the
plunger
on
the
hydraulic
ram
is
immersed
in
sand
and
covered
with
water
does
not
seem
to
be
conclusive
by
this
experiment
the
author
attempts
to
demonstrate
that
the
pressure
of
the
water
transmitted
through
the
sand
is
only
about
as
great
as
when
the
sand
is
not
there
the
travel
of
through
the
earth
is
at
times
very
slow
and
occasionally
only
at
the
rate
of
from
to
per
hour
in
the
writer
opinion
meem
experiment
did
not
cover
sufficient
time
during
which
the
pressure
was
maintained
at
any
given
point
it
is
quite
probable
that
it
may
take
or
min
for
the
full
pressure
to
be
transmitted
through
the
sand
to
the
bottom
of
the
plunger
and
it
is
hoped
therefore
that
he
will
make
further
experiments
lasting
long
enough
to
demonstrate
this
point
in
regard
to
the
question
of
skin
friction
on
caissons
and
piles
it
may
be
of
interest
to
mention
an
experiment
which
the
writer
made
during
the
sinking
of
the
large
caissons
for
the
williamsburg
bridge
these
caissons
were
about
long
and
wide
the
river
bottom
was
about
below
mean
high
water
and
the
caissons
penetrated
sand
of
good
quality
to
a
depth
of
from
to
below
that
level
on
two
occasions
calculations
were
made
to
determine
the
skin
friction
while
the
caissons
were
being
settled
with
the
cutting
edge
from
to
below
the
river
bottom
the
calculations
showed
that
the
skin
friction
was
between
and
lb
per
sq
ft
the
writer
agrees
with
meem
that
in
the
sinking
of
caissons
the
arch
action
of
sand
is
in
a
great
measure
destroyed
by
the
compressed
air
which
escapes
under
the
cutting
edge
and
percolates
up
through
the
material
close
to
the
sides
of
the
caissons
with
reference
to
the
skin
friction
on
piles
the
writer
agrees
with
meem
that
in
certain
classes
of
material
this
is
almost
a
negligible
quantity
the
writer
has
jacked
down
pipes
in
various
parts
of
new
york
city
and
by
placing
a
recording
gauge
on
the
hydraulic
jack
the
skin
friction
on
the
pile
could
be
obtained
very
accurately
in
several
instances
the
gauge
readings
did
not
vary
materially
from
the
surface
down
to
a
penetration
of
ft
in
these
instances
the
material
inside
the
pipe
was
cleaned
out
to
within
of
the
bottom
of
the
pile
so
that
the
gauge
reading
indicated
only
the
friction
on
the
outside
of
the
pipe
plus
the
bearing
value
developed
by
its
lower
edge
for
a
pipe
the
skin
friction
on
the
pile
plus
the
bearing
area
of
the
bottom
of
the
pipe
seems
to
be
about
tons
irrespective
of
the
depth
after
the
pipe
had
reached
sufficient
depth
it
was
concreted
and
after
the
concrete
had
set
the
jack
was
again
placed
on
it
and
gauge
readings
were
taken
it
was
found
that
in
ordinary
sands
the
concreted
steel
pile
would
go
down
from
to
after
which
it
would
bring
up
to
the
full
capacity
of
a
jack
showing
by
gauge
reading
a
reaction
of
from
to
tons
it
is
the
writer
opinion
that
in
reasonably
compact
sands
situated
at
a
depth
below
the
surface
which
will
not
allow
of
much
lateral
movement
a
reaction
of
tons
per
sq
of
area
can
be
obtained
without
any
difficulty
whatever
frank
carter
assoc
am
soc
by
letter
mr
meem
has
contributed
much
that
is
of
value
particularly
on
water
pressures
in
sand
just
what
result
would
be
obtained
if
coarse
crushed
stone
or
similar
material
were
substituted
for
sand
in
experiment
no
is
not
obvious
it
has
been
the
practice
lately
among
some
engineers
in
boston
as
well
as
in
new
york
city
to
assume
that
water
pressures
on
the
underside
of
inverts
is
exerted
on
the
area
only
the
writer
however
has
made
it
a
practice
first
to
lay
a
few
inches
of
cracked
stone
on
the
bottom
of
wet
excavations
in
order
to
keep
water
from
concrete
which
is
to
be
placed
in
the
invert
in
addition
to
the
cracked
stone
under
the
inverts
shallow
trenches
dug
laterally
across
the
excavation
to
insure
more
perfect
drainage
have
been
observed
both
these
factors
no
doubt
assist
the
free
course
of
water
in
exerting
pressure
on
the
finished
invert
after
the
underdrains
have
been
closed
up
on
completion
of
the
work
the
writer
therefore
awaits
with
interest
the
repetition
of
experiment
no
with
water
on
the
bottom
of
a
piston
buried
in
coarse
gravel
or
cracked
stone
as
for
the
arching
effect
of
sand
the
writer
believes
that
meem
has
demonstrated
an
important
principle
on
a
small
scale
it
must
be
regretted
however
that
the
box
was
not
made
larger
for
to
the
writer
it
appears
unsafe
to
draw
such
sweeping
conclusions
from
small
experiments
as
small
models
of
sailboats
fail
to
develop
completely
laws
for
the
design
and
control
of
large
racing
yachts
so
experiments
in
small
sand
boxes
may
fail
to
demonstrate
the
laws
governing
actual
pressures
on
structures
for
some
time
the
writer
has
been
using
a
process
of
reasoning
similar
to
that
of
the
author
for
assumptions
of
earth
pressure
on
the
roofs
of
tunnel
arches
except
that
the
vertical
forces
assumed
to
hold
up
the
weight
of
the
earth
have
been
ascribed
to
cohesion
and
friction
along
what
might
be
termed
the
sides
of
the
trench
excavation
the
writer
fails
to
find
proof
in
this
paper
of
the
author
statement
that
earth
pressures
on
the
sides
of
a
structure
buried
in
earth
are
greater
at
the
top
than
at
the
bottom
of
a
trench
that
some
banks
are
is
no
doubt
a
fact
the
writer
having
often
heard
similar
expressions
used
by
experienced
trench
foremen
but
in
every
case
called
to
his
attention
local
circumstances
have
caused
the
either
undermining
at
the
bottom
of
the
trench
too
much
banked
earth
on
top
or
the
earth
excavated
from
the
trench
being
too
near
the
edge
of
the
cut
for
some
years
the
writer
has
been
making
extended
observations
on
deep
trenches
and
thus
far
has
failed
to
find
evidence
except
in
aqueous
material
of
earth
pressures
which
might
be
expected
from
the
known
natural
slope
of
the
material
after
exposure
to
the
elements
and
this
latter
feature
may
explain
why
sheeted
trenches
stand
so
much
better
than
expected
if
air
had
free
access
to
the
material
cohesion
would
be
destroyed
and
theoretical
pressures
would
be
more
easily
developed
with
trenches
weathering
is
practically
excluded
and
the
bracing
which
seemingly
is
far
too
light
holds
up
the
trench
with
scarcely
a
mark
of
pressure
as
an
instance
in
the
writer
was
successfully
digging
sewer
trenches
from
to
deep
through
gravel
in
the
central
part
of
connecticut
without
bracing
because
of
demands
of
the
work
in
another
part
of
the
city
a
length
of
several
hundred
feet
of
trench
was
left
open
for
three
days
resulting
in
the
of
the
sides
the
elements
had
destroyed
the
cohesion
and
the
sides
of
the
trenches
no
longer
stood
vertically
recently
in
the
vicinity
of
boston
trenches
wide
and
from
to
deep
with
heavy
buildings
on
one
side
have
been
braced
with
by
stringers
and
bracers
at
centers
longitudinally
and
from
to
apart
vertically
this
timbering
apparently
was
too
slight
for
pressures
which
theoretically
might
be
expected
from
the
natural
slope
of
the
material
just
what
pressures
develop
on
the
sides
of
the
structures
in
these
deep
trenches
after
pulling
the
top
sheeting
the
bottom
sheeting
being
left
in
place
is
of
course
a
matter
of
conjecture
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
there
is
an
arching
of
the
material
as
suggested
by
the
author
how
much
this
may
be
assisted
by
the
practical
of
the
virgin
material
is
of
course
indeterminate
that
substructures
and
retaining
walls
designed
according
to
the
rankine
or
similar
theories
have
an
additional
factor
of
safety
from
too
generous
an
assumption
in
regard
to
earth
pressure
is
practically
admitted
everywhere
it
is
almost
an
engineering
axiom
that
retaining
walls
generally
fail
because
of
insufficient
foundation
only
for
the
foregoing
reasons
and
particularly
from
observations
on
the
effect
of
earth
pressures
on
wooden
timbers
used
as
bracing
the
writer
believes
that
ordinarily
the
theoretical
earth
pressures
computed
by
rankine
and
coulomb
are
not
realized
by
and
sometimes
not
even
by
or
in
trenches
well
rapidly
excavated
and
thoroughly
braced
meem
am
soc
by
letter
the
writer
has
been
much
interested
in
this
discussion
and
believes
that
it
will
be
of
general
value
to
the
profession
it
is
unfortunate
however
that
several
of
the
points
raised
have
been
due
to
a
careless
reading
of
or
failure
to
understand
the
paper
taking
up
the
discussion
in
detail
the
writer
will
first
answer
the
criticisms
of
goodrich
he
says
the
writer
believes
that
in
the
design
of
permanent
structures
consideration
of
arch
action
should
not
be
included
at
least
not
until
more
information
has
been
obtained
he
also
believes
that
the
design
of
temporary
structures
with
this
inclusion
is
actually
dangerous
in
some
instances
if
the
arching
action
of
earth
exists
why
should
it
not
be
recognized
and
considered
the
design
of
timbering
for
a
structure
to
rest
for
instance
at
a
depth
of
from
to
in
normal
dry
earth
without
considering
this
action
would
be
virtually
prohibitive
goodrich
proceeds
to
show
one
of
the
dangers
of
considering
such
action
by
quoting
the
writer
as
follows
about
an
hour
after
the
superimposed
load
had
been
removed
the
writer
jostled
the
box
with
his
foot
sufficiently
to
dislodge
some
of
the
exposed
sand
when
the
arch
at
once
collapsed
and
the
bottom
fell
to
the
ground
he
fails
as
do
so
many
other
critics
of
this
theory
to
distinguish
the
difference
between
that
portion
of
the
sand
which
acts
as
centering
and
that
which
goes
to
make
up
the
sustaining
arch
the
dislodgment
of
any
large
portion
of
this
centering
naturally
causes
collapse
unless
it
is
caught
in
which
case
the
void
in
the
centering
is
filled
from
the
material
in
the
sustaining
arch
and
this
in
turn
is
filled
from
that
above
and
so
on
until
the
stability
of
each
arch
is
in
turn
finally
established
this
however
does
not
mean
that
during
the
process
of
establishing
this
equilibrium
of
the
arch
stresses
there
is
no
arching
action
of
any
of
the
material
above
but
only
that
some
of
the
arches
are
temporarily
sustained
by
those
below
that
is
in
effect
each
area
of
the
material
above
becomes
in
turn
a
dependent
an
independent
and
finally
an
interdependent
arch
if
goodrich
experience
has
led
him
to
examine
any
large
number
of
tunnel
arches
or
brick
sewers
he
will
have
noted
in
many
of
them
longitudinal
cracks
at
the
soffits
of
the
arches
and
perhaps
elsewhere
these
result
from
three
causes
in
tunneling
there
is
more
or
less
loss
of
material
while
in
the
material
does
not
at
first
reach
its
final
compactness
therefore
in
adjusting
itself
to
normal
conditions
this
material
causes
impact
loads
to
come
upon
the
green
arch
and
these
tend
to
crack
it
no
matter
how
tightly
a
brick
or
other
arch
is
keyed
in
there
must
always
be
some
slight
subsidence
when
the
centers
are
struck
this
again
results
in
a
shock
or
impact
loading
to
the
detriment
of
the
arch
the
most
prolific
cause
however
is
that
in
tunneling
as
well
as
in
open
cuts
the
material
backing
up
the
haunches
is
more
or
less
loosened
and
therefore
is
not
at
first
compact
enough
to
prevent
the
spreading
of
the
haunches
when
the
load
comes
on
the
arch
this
causes
cracking
but
as
soon
as
the
haunches
have
been
pressed
out
against
the
solid
material
the
cracking
usually
ceases
unless
the
pressure
has
been
sufficiently
heavy
to
cause
collapse
an
interesting
example
of
this
was
noted
in
the
joralemon
street
branch
of
the
rapid
transit
tunnel
in
brooklyn
in
which
a
great
many
of
the
rings
were
cracked
under
the
crown
of
the
arch
during
construction
but
in
spite
of
this
they
sustained
for
more
than
two
years
a
loading
which
according
to
goodrich
was
continually
increasing
in
other
words
the
cracked
arch
sustained
a
greater
loading
than
that
which
cracked
the
plates
during
construction
according
to
his
theory
as
noted
in
the
following
quotation
but
it
should
be
equally
conceded
by
the
advocates
of
the
existence
of
such
action
that
changes
in
humidity
due
to
moving
water
vibration
and
appreciable
viscosity
will
invariably
destroy
this
action
in
time
as
to
the
correctness
of
this
theory
goodrich
would
probably
have
great
difficulty
in
convincing
naturalists
who
are
aware
that
many
animals
live
in
enlarged
burrows
the
stability
of
which
is
dependent
on
the
arching
action
of
the
earth
in
fact
many
of
these
burrows
have
entrances
under
water
he
would
also
have
some
difficulty
in
convincing
those
experienced
miners
who
after
a
always
wait
until
the
ground
has
settled
and
compacted
itself
before
tunneling
usually
with
apparent
safety
over
the
scene
of
the
the
writer
quotes
as
follows
from
goodrich
discussion
in
any
case
no
arch
action
can
be
brought
into
play
until
a
certain
amount
of
settlement
has
taken
place
so
as
to
bring
the
particles
into
closer
contact
and
in
such
a
way
that
the
internal
stresses
are
practically
those
only
of
compression
and
the
shearing
stresses
are
within
the
limits
possible
for
the
material
in
question
further
consequently
an
almost
infinitesimal
settlement
of
the
may
cause
the
complete
destruction
of
an
arch
of
earth
and
further
on
the
other
hand
it
is
believed
that
the
author
statement
as
to
the
of
marbles
to
arch
should
be
qualified
by
the
addition
of
the
words
when
a
certain
amount
of
deflection
has
taken
place
so
as
to
bring
the
arch
into
action
in
a
large
measure
the
writer
agrees
with
the
first
and
last
quotations
but
sees
no
reason
to
endorse
the
second
as
it
is
impossible
to
consider
any
arch
being
built
which
does
not
settle
slightly
at
least
when
the
centers
are
struck
regarding
his
criticism
of
the
lack
of
arching
action
in
balls
or
marbles
he
seems
to
reason
that
the
movement
of
the
marbles
would
destroy
the
arch
action
it
is
very
difficult
for
the
writer
to
conceive
how
it
would
be
possible
for
balls
or
marbles
to
move
when
confined
as
they
would
be
confined
if
the
earth
were
composed
of
them
instead
of
its
present
ingredients
and
under
the
same
conditions
otherwise
goodrich
can
demonstrate
the
correctness
of
the
writer
theories
however
if
he
will
repeat
the
writer
experiment
no
with
marbles
with
buckshot
and
with
dry
sand
he
is
also
advised
to
make
the
experiment
with
sand
and
water
described
by
the
writer
and
is
assured
that
if
he
will
see
that
the
washers
are
absolutely
tight
before
putting
the
water
into
the
box
he
can
do
this
without
bringing
about
the
collapse
of
the
arch
the
only
essential
condition
is
that
the
bottom
shall
be
keyed
up
tightly
so
as
not
to
allow
the
escape
of
any
sand
he
is
also
referred
to
the
two
photographs
plate
xxiv
illustrating
the
writer
first
experiment
showing
how
increases
in
the
loading
resulted
in
compacting
the
material
of
the
arch
and
in
the
consequent
lowering
of
the
false
bottom
as
long
as
the
exposed
sand
above
this
false
bottom
had
cohesion
enough
to
prevent
the
collapse
of
the
centering
this
arch
could
have
been
loaded
with
safety
up
to
the
limits
of
the
compressive
strength
of
the
sand
to
quote
again
from
goodrich
furthermore
the
author
reason
for
bisecting
the
angle
between
the
vertical
and
the
angle
of
repose
of
the
material
when
he
undertakes
to
determine
the
thickness
of
key
is
not
obvious
this
assumption
is
shown
to
be
absurd
when
carried
to
either
limit
for
when
the
angle
of
repose
equals
zero
as
is
the
case
with
water
this
method
would
give
a
definite
thickness
of
key
while
there
can
be
absolutely
no
arch
action
possible
in
such
a
case
and
when
the
angle
of
repose
is
as
may
be
assumed
in
the
case
of
rock
this
method
would
give
an
infinite
thickness
of
key
which
is
again
seen
to
be
absurd
goodrich
assumes
that
water
or
liquid
has
an
angle
of
repose
equal
to
zero
which
is
true
but
the
writer
assumptions
applied
only
to
solid
material
and
the
liquid
gives
an
essentially
different
condition
of
pressure
as
shown
by
a
careful
reading
of
the
paper
in
solid
rock
goodrich
assumes
an
angle
of
repose
equal
to
for
which
there
is
no
authority
that
is
solid
rock
has
no
known
angle
of
repose
in
order
to
carry
these
assumptions
to
a
definite
conclusion
we
must
assume
for
that
material
with
an
angle
of
repose
of
some
solid
material
which
has
weight
but
no
thrust
such
as
blocks
of
ice
piled
vertically
in
this
case
goodrich
can
readily
see
that
there
will
be
no
arching
action
over
the
structure
and
that
the
required
thickness
of
key
would
be
infinite
as
to
the
other
case
it
is
somewhat
difficult
to
conceive
of
a
solid
with
an
angle
of
repose
of
zero
aqueous
material
does
not
fulfill
this
condition
as
it
is
either
a
liquid
or
a
combination
of
water
and
solid
material
the
best
illustration
perhaps
would
be
to
assume
a
material
composed
of
iron
filings
into
which
had
been
driven
a
powerful
magnet
so
that
the
iron
filings
would
be
drawn
horizontally
in
one
direction
it
is
easy
to
conceive
then
that
in
tunneling
through
this
material
there
would
be
no
necessity
for
holding
up
the
roof
the
definite
thickness
of
key
given
as
being
at
the
point
of
intersection
of
two
angles
would
be
merely
a
precautionary
measure
and
would
not
be
required
in
practice
it
is
thus
seen
that
both
these
conditions
can
be
fulfilled
with
practical
illustrations
that
is
for
an
angle
of
repose
of
that
material
which
has
weight
and
no
thrust
and
for
an
angle
of
repose
of
zero
that
solid
material
which
has
thrust
but
no
weight
goodrich
says
the
author
has
given
no
experiments
to
prove
his
statement
that
the
arch
thrust
is
greater
in
dryer
sand
if
goodrich
will
make
the
experiment
partially
described
as
experiment
no
with
absolutely
dry
sand
and
with
moist
sand
and
on
a
scale
large
enough
to
eliminate
cohesion
he
will
probably
find
enough
to
convince
him
that
in
this
assumption
the
writer
is
correct
at
the
same
time
the
writer
has
based
his
theory
in
this
regard
on
facts
which
are
not
entirely
conclusive
and
his
mind
is
open
as
to
what
future
experiments
on
a
large
scale
may
develop
it
is
very
probable
however
that
an
analytical
and
practical
examination
of
the
english
experiments
noted
on
pages
and
will
be
sufficient
to
develop
this
fact
conclusively
the
writer
is
forced
to
conclude
that
some
of
the
criticisms
by
goodrich
result
from
a
not
too
careful
reading
of
the
paper
for
instance
he
states
is
conceded
line
for
example
when
the
writer
for
one
has
not
even
conceded
the
accuracy
of
the
assumptions
a
more
careful
reading
would
have
shown
goodrich
that
this
concession
was
one
of
the
writer
as
to
certain
pressures
against
or
on
tunnels
and
if
goodrich
does
not
concede
this
he
is
even
more
radical
than
the
writer
and
again
can
anyone
doubt
that
the
top
timbers
are
stressed
more
heavily
than
those
at
the
bottom
is
emphatically
doubted
and
earnestly
denied
by
the
writer
it
is
unfortunate
that
goodrich
failed
to
make
the
complete
quotation
which
reads
nor
can
anyone
looking
at
fig
doubt
etc
a
glance
at
fig
will
demonstrate
that
under
conditions
there
set
forth
the
writer
is
probably
correct
in
his
assertion
as
relating
to
that
particular
instance
further
for
instance
the
author
theory
that
the
pressures
against
retaining
walls
are
a
maximum
at
the
top
and
decrease
to
zero
at
the
bottom
is
in
absolute
contradiction
to
the
results
of
experiments
conducted
on
a
large
scale
by
the
writer
on
the
new
reinforced
concrete
retaining
wall
near
the
george
ferry
on
staten
island
the
writer
theory
that
pressures
against
retaining
walls
are
a
maximum
at
the
top
and
decrease
to
zero
at
the
bottom
applies
only
to
pressures
exerted
by
absolutely
dry
and
normally
dry
material
and
it
seems
to
him
that
this
theory
is
capable
of
such
easy
demonstration
by
the
simple
observation
of
any
bracing
in
a
deep
trench
in
material
of
this
class
that
it
ought
to
be
accepted
as
at
least
safer
than
the
old
theory
which
it
reverses
as
to
this
theory
in
material
subject
to
water
pressure
a
careful
reading
of
the
paper
or
an
examination
of
fig
and
its
accompanying
text
or
an
examination
of
table
will
convince
goodrich
that
under
the
writer
analysis
this
pressure
does
not
decrease
to
zero
at
the
bottom
but
that
in
soft
materials
it
may
be
approximately
constant
all
the
way
down
while
in
exceptionally
soft
material
conditions
may
arise
where
it
may
increase
toward
the
bottom
the
determination
should
be
made
by
taking
the
solid
material
and
drying
it
sufficiently
so
that
water
does
not
flow
or
seep
from
it
when
this
material
is
then
compacted
to
the
condition
in
which
it
would
be
in
its
natural
state
its
angle
of
repose
may
be
measured
and
may
be
found
to
be
as
high
as
degrees
the
very
fine
matter
should
then
be
separated
from
the
coarser
material
and
the
latter
weighed
to
determine
its
proportion
subtracting
this
from
the
total
the
remainder
could
be
credited
to
aqueous
matter
it
is
thus
seen
that
with
a
material
when
partially
dried
in
which
the
natural
angle
of
repose
might
be
and
in
which
the
percentage
of
water
or
aqueous
matter
when
submerged
might
be
there
would
be
an
increase
of
pressure
toward
the
bottom
the
writer
does
not
know
the
exact
nature
of
the
experiments
made
at
george
ferry
by
goodrich
but
he
supposes
they
were
measurements
of
pressures
on
pistons
through
holes
in
the
sheeting
he
desires
to
state
again
that
he
can
not
regard
such
experiments
as
conclusive
and
believes
that
they
are
of
comparative
value
only
as
such
experiments
do
not
measure
in
any
large
degree
the
pressure
of
the
solid
material
but
only
all
or
a
portion
of
the
aqueous
matter
that
is
the
liquid
and
very
fine
material
which
flows
with
it
thus
it
is
well
known
that
during
the
construction
of
the
recent
hudson
and
north
river
tunnels
pressures
were
tested
in
the
silt
some
of
which
showed
that
the
silt
exerted
full
hydrostatic
pressure
at
the
same
time

a
public
lecture
and
recently
also
to
the
writer
that
in
he
made
some
tests
of
the
pressure
of
this
silt
in
normal
air
for
the
late
hutton
am
soc
a
hole
in
square
was
cut
through
the
brickwork
and
the
iron
lining
just
back
of
the
lock
in
the
north
tube
in
normal
air
and
about
from
the
new
jersey
shore
it
was
found
that
the
silt
had
become
so
firm
that
it
did
not
flow
into
the
opening
later
a
collar
and
piston
were
built
into
the
opening
and
during
a
period
covering
at
least
months
constant
observations
showed
that
no
pressure
came
upon
it
in
fact
it
was
stated
that
the
piston
was
frequently
worked
back
and
forth
to
induce
pressure
but
no
response
was
obtained
during
all
this
period
the
conclusion
must
then
be
drawn
that
when
construction
with
its
attendant
disturbance
has
stopped
the
solid
material
surrounding
structures
tends
to
compact
itself
more
or
less
and
solidify
according
as
it
is
more
or
less
porous
forming
in
many
instances
what
may
be
virtually
a
compact
arch
shutting
off
a
large
percentage
of
the
normal
and
some
percentage
even
of
the
aqueous
pressure
that
the
pressure
of
normally
dry
material
can
not
be
measured
through
small
openings
can
be
verified
by
any
one
who
will
examine
such
material
back
of
bracing
showing
evidences
of
heavy
pressure
the
investigator
will
find
that
if
this
material
is
free
from
water
pressure
paper
stuffed
lightly
into
small
openings
will
hold
back
indefinitely
material
which
in
large
masses
has
frequently
caused
bracing
to
buckle
and
sheeting
planks
to
bend
and
break
and
the
writer
reiterates
that
such
experiments
should
be
made
in
trenches
sheeted
with
horizontal
sheeting
bearing
against
short
vertical
rangers
and
braces
giving
horizontal
sections
absolutely
detached
and
independent
of
each
other
in
no
other
way
can
such
experiments
be
of
real
value
and
even
then
only
when
made
on
a
large
scale
to
determine
conclusively
the
pressure
of
earth
on
trenches
as
to
the
questions
of
the
relative
thrust
of
materials
under
various
angles
of
repose
and
of
the
necessity
of
dividing
by
the
tangent
etc
these
to
the
writer
seem
to
be
merely
the
solution
of
problems
in
simple
graphics
the
writer
believes
that
if
goodrich
will
make
even
on
a
small
scale
some
of
the
experiments
noted
by
the
writer
he
will
be
convinced
that
many
of
the
assumptions
which
he
can
not
at
present
endorse
are
based
on
fact
and
his
will
be
welcomed
with
the
greatest
interest
among
the
experiments
which
he
is
asked
to
make
is
the
one
in
dry
sand
noted
as
experiment
no
whereby
it
can
be
shown
very
conclusively
that
additional
will
result
in
increased
arching
stability
on
an
arch
which
would
collapse
under
lighter
loading
the
writer
is
indebted
to
goodrich
for
pointing
out
some
errors
in
omission
and
in
typography
now
corrected
and
for
his
hearty
concurrence
in
some
of
the
assumptions
which
the
writer
believed
would
meet
with
greatest
disapproval
in
reply
to
pruyn
and
gregory
the
writer
assumed
that
the
piston
area
in
experiment
no
should
be
reduced
only
by
the
actual
contact
of
material
with
it
if
this
material
in
contact
should
be
composed
of
theoretical
spheres
resulting
in
a
contact
with
points
only
then
the
theoretical
area
reduced
should
be
in
proportion
to
this
amount
only
the
writer
does
not
believe
however
that
this
condition
exists
in
practice
but
thinks
that
the
area
is
reduced
very
much
more
than
by
the
actual
theoretical
contact
of
the
material
he
sees
no
reason
as
far
as
he
has
gone
to
doubt
the
accuracy
of
the
deductions
from
this
experiment
regarding
the
question
of
the
length
of
time
required
to
raise
the
piston
he
does
not
believe
that
the
position
of
his
critics
is
entirely
correct
in
this
matter
that
is
it
must
either
be
conceded
that
the
piston
area
is
cut
off
from
the
source
of
pressure
or
that
it
is
in
contact
with
it
through
more
or
less
minute
channels
of
water
if
it
is
cut
off
then
the
writer
contention
is
proved
without
the
need
of
the
experiment
and
it
is
therefore
conclusive
that
a
submerged
tunnel
is
not
under
aqueous
pressure
or
the
buoyant
action
of
water
if
on
the
other
hand
the
water
is
in
contact
through
channels
bearing
directly
upon
the
piston
and
leading
to
the
clear
water
chamber
any
increase
in
pressure
in
the
water
chamber
must
necessarily
result
in
a
virtually
instantaneous
increase
of
the
pressure
against
the
piston
and
therefore
the
action
on
the
latter
should
follow
almost
immediately
in
all
cases
during
the
experiments
the
piston
did
not
respond
until
the
pressure
was
approximately
twice
as
great
as
required
in
clear
water
therefore
the
writer
must
conclude
either
that
the
experiments
proved
it
conclusively
or
that
his
assumption
is
proved
without
the
necessity
of
the
experiments
that
is
the
pressure
is
virtually
not
in
evidence
until
the
piston
has
commenced
to
move
pruyn
has
added
valuable
information
in
his
presentation
of
data
obtained
from
specific
tests
of
the
bearing
value
of
and
friction
on
hollow
steel
piles
these
data
largely
corroborate
tests
and
observations
by
the
writer
and
are
commended
to
general
attention
carter
information
is
also
of
special
interest
to
the
writer
as
much
of
it
is
in
the
line
of
confirming
his
views
carter
does
not
yet
accept
the
theory
of
increased
pressure
toward
the
top
but
if
he
will
examine
or
experiment
with
heavy
bracing
in
deep
trenches
in
clear
sand
or
material
with
angles
of
repose
he
will
probably
find
much
to
help
him
toward
the
acceptance
of
this
view
the
writer
regrets
that
he
has
not
now
the
means
or
appliances
for
further
experiments
with
the
piston
chamber
but
he
does
not
believe
that
reliable
results
could
be
obtained
in
broken
stone
with
so
small
a
piston
as
it
is
possible
that
the
point
of
one
stone
only
might
be
in
contact
with
the
piston
this
would
naturally
leave
the
base
exposed
almost
wholly
to
a
clear
water
area
he
does
not
believe
however
that
in
practice
the
laying
of
broken
stone
under
inverts
will
materially
change
the
ultimate
pressure
unless
its
represents
a
large
area
perry
will
find
the
following
on
page
it
should
be
noted
also
that
although
the
area
subject
to
pressure
is
diminished
the
pressure
on
the
area
remaining
corresponds
to
the
full
hydrostatic
head
as
would
be
shown
by
the
pressure
on
an
air
gauge
this
of
course
depends
on
the
porosity
of
the
material
and
the
friction
the
water
meets
in
passing
through
it
as
to
thomson
discussion
the
writer
notes
with
regret
two
points
that
specific
data
are
not
given
in
many
of
the
interesting
cases
of
failures
of
certain
structures
or
bracing
and
that
he
has
not
in
all
cases
a
clear
understanding
of
the
paper
for
instance
the
writer
has
not
advocated
the
omission
of
bottom
bracing
or
sheeting
he
has
seen
many
instances
where
it
has
been
or
could
have
been
safely
omitted
but
he
desires
to
make
it
clear
that
he
does
not
under
any
circumstances
advocate
its
omission
in
good
work
but
only
that
in
bracing
its
strength
may
be
decreased
as
it
approaches
the
bottom
reference
is
again
made
to
the
diagram
fig
which
shows
that
in
most
cases
of
in
combined
aqueous
and
earth
pressure
there
may
be
nearly
equal
and
in
some
cases
even
greater
loading
toward
the
bottom
the
writer
also
specifically
states
that
in
air
the
difference
between
aqueous
and
earth
pressure
is
plainly
noted
by
the
fact
that
bracing
is
needed
so
frequently
to
hold
back
the
earth
while
the
air
is
keeping
out
the
water
the
lack
of
specific
data
is
especially
noticeable
in
the
account
of
the
rise
of
the
conduit
at
toronto
it
would
be
of
great
interest
to
know
with
certainly
the
weight
of
the
pipe
per
foot
and
whether
it
was
properly
bedded
and
properly
in
all
probability
the
over
certain
areas
was
not
properly
done
and
as
the
pipe
was
exposed
to
an
upward
pressure
of
nearly
lb
per
with
probably
only
or
lb
of
weight
to
counterbalance
it
it
can
readily
be
seen
that
it
did
not
conform
with
the
writer
general
suggestion
that
structures
not
compactly
or
only
partially
buried
should
have
a
large
factor
of
safety
against
the
upward
pressure
opposed
to
thomson
experience
in
this
instance
is
the
fact
that
oftentimes
the
tunnels
under
the
east
river
approached
very
close
to
the
surface
with
the
material
above
them
so
soupy
owing
to
the
escape
of
compressed
air
that
their
upper
surfaces
were
temporarily
in
water
yet
there
was
no
instance
in
which
they
rose
although
some
of
them
were
under
excessive
buoyant
pressure
it
is
also
of
interest
to
note
from
the
papers
descriptive
of
the
north
river
tunnel
that
with
shield
doors
closed
the
shield
tended
to
rise
while
by
opening
the
doors
to
take
in
muck
the
shield
could
be
brought
down
or
kept
down
the
writer
concurs
with
those
who
believe
that
the
rising
of
the
shield
with
closed
doors
was
due
to
the
slightly
greater
density
of
the
material
below
and
was
not
in
any
way
due
to
buoyancy
concerning
the
collapse
of
the
bracing
in
the
tunnel
built
under
a
the
writer
believes
it
was
due
to
the
fact
that
it
was
under
a
sliding
and
that
if
it
had
been
possible
to
have
over
and
above
this
tunnel
to
a
very
large
extent
this
would
have
resulted
in
checking
the
sliding
of
material
against
the
tunnel
and
the
work
would
thereafter
have
been
done
with
safety
this
is
corroborated
by
thomson
statement
that
the
tunnel
was
subsequently
carried
through
safely
by
going
farther
into
the
hill
as
to
the
angle
of
repose
thomson
seems
to
feel
that
its
determination
is
so
often
impracticable
that
it
is
not
to
be
relied
on
and
yet
all
calculations
pertaining
to
earth
pressure
must
be
based
on
this
factor
the
writer
believes
that
the
angle
of
repose
is
not
difficult
to
determine
and
that
observations
of
and
experiments
on
exposed
banks
in
similar
material
and
general
experience
in
relation
thereto
will
enable
one
to
determine
it
in
nearly
all
cases
within
such
reasonably
accurate
limits
that
only
a
small
margin
of
safety
need
be
added
engineers
are
sent
to
europe
to
study
sewage
disposal
water
purification
transit
problems
but
are
rarely
sent
to
an
adjoining
county
or
state
to
look
at
an
exposed
bank
which
would
perhaps
solve
a
vexed
problem
in
bracing
and
result
in
great
economy
in
the
design
of
permanent
structures
thomson
general
views
seem
to
indicate
that
much
of
the
subject
matter
noted
in
the
paper
relates
to
unsolvable
problems
for
it
appears
that
in
many
cases
he
believes
the
engineer
to
be
dependent
on
his
educated
guess
backed
perhaps
by
the
experienced
guess
of
the
foreman
or
practical
man
the
writer
on
the
contrary
believes
that
every
problem
relating
to
work
of
this
class
is
capable
of
being
solved
within
reasonably
accurate
limits
and
that
the
time
is
not
far
distant
when
the
engineer
with
his
study
of
conditions
and
samples
of
material
before
him
will
be
able
to
solve
his
earth
pressure
and
earth
resistance
problems
as
accurately
as
the
bridge
engineer
with
his
knowledge
of
structural
materials
solves
bridge
problems
the
writer
in
the
course
of
his
experience
has
met
with
or
been
interested
in
the
solution
of
many
problems
similar
to
the
following
what
difference
in
timbering
should
be
made
for
a
tunnel
in
ordinary
normally
dry
ground
at
a
depth
of
to
the
roof
as
compared
with
one
at
a
depth
of
what
difference
in
timbering
or
in
permanent
design
should
be
made
for
a
shaft
square
going
to
a
depth
of
and
one
by
for
instance
going
to
the
same
depth
assuming
each
to
be
braced
and
sheeted
horizontally
with
independent
bracing
what
allowance
should
be
made
for
the
strength
of
interlock
assuming
that
a
circular
bulkhead
of
sand
in
diameter
is
to
be
carried
by
steel
exposed
around
the
outside
for
a
depth
of
what
average
pressure
per
square
foot
of
area
should
be
required
to
drive
a
section
of
a
by
roof
shield
as
compared
with
the
pressure
needed
to
drive
the
whole
roof
shield
with
an
area
four
times
as
great
to
what
depth
could
a
by
timber
be
driven
under
gradually
added
pressure
up
to
tons
for
instance
in
normal
sand
what
frictional
resistance
should
be
assumed
on
a
hollow
steel
pile
which
had
been
driven
through
sharp
sand
and
had
penetrated
soft
marshy
material
the
bearing
resistance
of
which
was
practically
valueless
what
allowance
should
be
made
for
the
buoyancy
of
a
tunnel
in
diameter
the
top
of
which
was
buried
to
a
depth
of
in
sand
above
which
there
was
of
water
it
is
believed
by
the
writer
that
most
of
the
authorities
are
silent
as
to
the
solution
of
problems
similar
to
the
above
and
it
is
because
of
this
lack
of
available
data
that
he
has
directed
his
studies
to
them
the
belief
that
the
results
of
these
studies
together
with
such
observations
and
experiments
as
relate
thereto
may
be
of
interest
has
caused
him
to
set
them
forth
in
this
paper
he
desires
to
state
his
belief
that
if
problems
similar
to
the
above
were
given
for
definite
solution
not
based
on
ordinary
safe
practice
and
without
conference
to
a
number
of
engineers
prominently
interested
in
such
matters
the
results
would
vary
so
widely
as
to
convince
some
of
the
critics
of
this
paper
that
the
greater
danger
lies
rather
in
the
of
such
fields
than
in
the
setting
forth
of
results
of
exploration
which
may
appear
to
be
somewhat
radical
further
if
these
views
result
in
stimulating
enough
interest
to
lead
to
the
hope
that
eventually
the
pressure
resistance
and
stability
of
ground
under
varying
conditions
will
be
known
within
reasonably
accurate
limits
and
tabulated
the
writer
will
feel
that
his
efforts
have
not
been
in
vain
