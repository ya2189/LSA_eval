preface
several
years
ago
the
author
of
this
volume
published
a
small
work
on
the
warming
and
ventilation
of
buildings
which
was
very
favourably
received
by
the
public
but
is
now
out
of
print
he
afterwards
wrote
various
other
works
illustrating
the
architecture
of
england
during
the
reigns
of
queen
elizabeth
and
james
with
one
volume
on
ornamental
designs
these
had
an
extensive
sale
and
are
now
like
the
first
small
volume
out
of
print
his
last
publication
was
a
small
pamphlet
entitled
smoke
nuisance
and
its
remedy
with
remarks
on
liquid
fuel
the
subject
of
which
at
least
so
far
as
regards
an
improved
construction
for
the
domestic
chimney
flue
is
continued
in
the
present
volume
the
present
volume
consists
of
numerous
plans
for
cottages
villas
and
small
and
large
mansions
most
of
which
have
been
carried
into
execution
they
are
carefully
selected
from
a
large
collection
of
similar
subjects
the
result
of
many

and
it
is
hoped
that
they
may
be
favourably
received

introductory
chapter
on
the
picturesque
in
relation
to
architecture
illustration
grecian
temple
it
has
been
said
that
a
definition
of
the
picturesque
in
respect
to
architecture
or
indeed
any
branch
of
the
fine
arts
is
scarcely
possible
the
most
able
writers
on
the
subject
have
failed
to
convey
an
adequate
and
popular
idea
in
fact
the
term
has
so
great
and
extensive
an
application
as
to
forbid
exact
definition
the
architect
usually
considers
that
if
his
building
look
well
when
seen
by
moonlight
or
through
the
medium
of
a
foggy
or
dull
atmosphere
it
is
picturesque
and
he
is
satisfied
blenheim
castle
and
castle
howard
have
always
been
pointed
out
as
eminent
examples
of
the
picturesque
in
buildings
but
this
quality
varies
with
every
change
of
situation
and
circumstance
under
which
it
can
be
conceived
the
entrance
to
the
acropolis
of
athens
with
its
noble
equestrian
statues
in
the
foreground
the
steps
between
them
and
the
beautiful
temples
rising
at
different
heights
behind
giving
a
varied
outline
the
whole
probably
delicately
coloured
must
have
been
picturesque
in
the
highest
degree
the
temple
of
the
winds
and
the
monument
of
lysicrates
were
equally
examples
of
the
picturesque
yet
although
great
efforts
were
made
on
the
publication
of
athenian
volumes
to
introduce
pure
grecian
architecture
here
it
has
obtained
no
hold
with
us
pancras
church
and
camden
town
are
probably
the
last
specimens
in
our
metropolis
the
delicate
mouldings
of
the
one
are
destroyed
by
the
roughness
of
the
climate
and
the
beautiful
figures
of
the
caryatid√¶
in
the
other
are
covered
with
soot
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
roman
temples
were
as
picturesque
and
as
varied
in
outline
as
the
grecian
buildings
of
which
they
were
studies
but
none
remain

perfect
to
illustrate
them
in
their
original
entire
state
with
the
surfaces
and

and
even
either
in
painting
or
reality
they
were
beautiful
in
ruins
there
is
no
denying
they
are
highly
picturesque
observe
the
process
by
which
time
the
great
author
of
such
changes
works
first
by
means
of
weather
stains
partial
incrustations
mosses
which
simultaneously
take
off
the
uniformity
of
surface
and
of
colour
giving
a
degree
of
roughness
and
variety
of
tint
then
the
various
accidents
of
weather
loosen
the
stones
themselves
they
tumble
in
irregular
masses
upon
what
was
perhaps
smooth
turf
or
pavement
or
nicely
trimmed
walks
and
shrubberies
now
mixed
and
overgrown
with
wild
plants
and
creepers
that
crawl
over
and
shoot

falling

plants

even

of
the

the
first
view

in
this
volume
attempts
to
show
the
picturesque
effect
of
the
grecian
temple
in
its
complete
state

attendants
having
just
retired
from
some
display
or
ceremony
the
second
the
front
of
a
roman
temple
in
its
noble
remains
to
the
greeks
we
owe
all
the
general
principles
and
forms
of
classic
art
but
they
have
been
modified
to
modern
ideas
and
tastes
and
it
may
be
added
to
suit
also
the
various
climates
of
the
countries
where
they
have
been
adopted
however
much
the
occupations
of
our
countrymen
may
partake
of
the
commercial
character
the
mental
qualities
requisite
to
such
pursuits
have
not
been
so
displayed
as
to
exclude
a
taste
for
art
where
for
example
can
be
found
superior
specimens
of
than
exist
in
their
mansions
villas
or
their
picture
and
sculpture
galleries
or
the
museums
and
other
collections
of
those
whose
business
pursuits
have
been
the
cause
of
their
prosperity
an
essential
element
of
success
in
every
branch
of
progress
is
involved
in
tasteful
selection
without
considering
those
classes
who
by
successful
efforts
of
their
ancestry
have
been
placed
beyond
the
pale
of
want
either
artificial
or
real
a
large
proportion
of
our
population
may
be
ranked
as
having
advanced
morally
socially
and
commercially
by
that
intuition
which
characterizes
our
national
progress
it
takes
as
its
basis
nature
and
products
it
eliminates
from
these
not
only
pecuniary
benefits
that
in
a
commercial
point
of
view
may
occur
but
associating
the
useful
with
the
beautiful
the
sense
of
the
latter
having
been
gained
during
intervals
of
quiet
thought
as
a
relief
from
the
incessant
requirements
of
business
engagements
a
tendency
to
embody
the
picturesque
especially
in
regard
to
architecture
arises
we
have
no
hesitation
in
assigning
to
this
cause
the
production
of
some
of
the
most
picturesque
architectural
erections
which
grace
our
country
that
render
english
homes
an
example
and
prove
that
while
the
main
element
of
our
national
prosperity
is
making
money
we
are
not
insensible
to
the
beneficent
influences
resulting
from
the
cultivation
of
refined
taste
it
would
be
interesting
as
an
object
of
careful
inquiry
if
there
existed
sufficient
data
for
the
purpose
to
trace
each
of
the
many
steps
that
have
occurred
between
the
birth
of
architecture
and
its
present
condition
the
early
history
of
mankind
had
as
its
locality
climates
which
favoured
the
construction
and
use
of
the
contrivances
intended
only
to
meet
the
few
wants
of
shelter
and
occasional
domestic
privacy
the
first
condition
of
existence
either
in
this
primitive
or
modern
state
is
that
of
roving
or
wandering
tribes
instances
of
this
are
found
in
the
early
inhabitants
of
asia
minor
and
adjacent
countries
and
at
the
present
day
the
same
habit
is
maintained
in
central
asia
arabia
and
many
parts
of
america
as
soon
as
the
sustenance
afforded
for
their
cattle
is
consumed
in
one
district
a
migration
is
made
to
another
gradually
however
centres
of
trade
sprung
up
where
commodities
could
be
bartered
for
live
stock
men
thus
became
massed
together
in
villages
and
towns
quitting
a
condition
they
built
permanent
residences
in
place
of
the
tent
at
first
these
like
the
of
the
modern
canadian
were
only
sufficient
for
the
most
common
necessities
of
life
in
course
of
time
however
the
spirit
of
emulation
the
growth
of
riches
and
the
germination
of
natural
taste
for
the
beautiful
led
to
artificial
wants
which
were
soon
converted
into
necessities
of
life
this
called
out
the
study
of
art
on
the
part
of
the
few
for
the
benefit
of
the
many
systems
of
art
in
all
its
branches
gradually
developed
themselves
by
the
study
of
the
beauties
of
nature
such
systems
gradually
progressed
in
purity
of
style
and
produced
designs
that
eventually
were
appreciated
by
the
common
people
in
a
greater
or
less
degree
according
to
the
capabilities
of
each
individual
architecture
and
the
other
fine
arts
thus
by
slow
but
sure
degrees
began
to
gain
a
hold
on
popular
taste
and
step
by
step
they
arrived
at
the
state
of
perfection
of
which
we
now
boast
it
will
be
evident
that
whilst
the
primary
objects
of
architecture
were
simply
those
of
meeting
the
immediate
necessities
of
life
its
ultimate
purpose
was
only
attained
when
it
became
an
art
cultivated
by
refined
taste
an
educated
eye
and
encouraged
by
the
growth
of
civilization
and
commerce
it
thus
advanced
from
a
state
of
barbarism
into
one
in
which
it
was
connected
with
all
the
highest
developments
of
the
moral
and
mental
qualities
of
mankind
but
especially
with
the
√¶sthetic
aspirations
of
our
nature
incidentally
but
necessarily
connected
with
the
general
progress
of
architecture
is
the
great
variety
of
styles
that
has
been
invented
the
whole
of
these
are
modifications
of
some
one
or
more
primaries
no
two
individuals
acquire
the
same
mental
impression
by
viewing
one
object
each
of
their
impressions
is
tinted
by
the
mental
characteristics
of
the
individual
it
is
therefore
from
this
cause
that
so
many
varieties
of
style
have
originated
from
one
first
model
an
illustration
of
this
is
afforded
in
the
gothic
which
in
different
hands
has
been
greatly
divided
and
modified
in
its
details
this
style
which
at
first
was
of
exclusive
application
only
has
subsequently
become
most
extensively
in
use
for
purposes
that
at
first
sight
it
would
have
been
judged
as
quite
unfit
for
the
style
of
architecture
just
referred
to
is
remarkable
for
its
picturesque
character
and
may
fitly
be
adduced
as
an
ensample
of
that
quality
in
the
absence
of
an
exact
definition
of
the
term
an
able
writer
criticising
gothic
buildings
remarks
that
the
outline
of
the
summit
presents
a
great
variety
of
forms
of
turrets
and
pinnacles
some
open
some
fretted
and
variously
enriched
but
even
where
there
is
an
exact
correspondence
of
parts
it
is
often
disguised
by
an
appearance
of
splendid
confusion
and
irregularity
in
the
doors
and
windows
of
gothic
churches
the
pointed
arch
has
as
much
variety
as
any
regular
figure
can
well
have
the
eye
too
is
less
strongly
conducted
than
by
the
parallel
lines
in
the
grecian
style
from
the
top
of
one
aperture
to
that
of
another
and
every
person
must
be
struck
with
the
extreme
richness
and
intricacy
of
some
of
the
principal
windows
of
our
cathedrals
and
ruined
abbeys
in
these
last
is
displayed
the
triumph
of
the
picturesque
and
their
charms
to
a
eye
are
often
so
great
as
to
rival
those
which
arise
from
the
chaste
ornaments
and
the
noble
and
elegant
simplicity
of
grecian
architecture
these
remarks
will
explain
to
a
certain
degree
the
nature
of
the
picturesque
in
regard
to
architecture
so
far
at
least
as
the
general
principles
are
involved
but
in
the
more
minute
points
other
questions
and
relations
arise
to
which
the
attention
of
the
reader
will
be
fully
drawn
in
the
descriptive
text
and
illustrations
of
this
work
the
comparative
value
of
grecian
and
gothic
architecture
as
practically
adopted
in
the
erection
of
ornamental
dwellings
is
well
discussed
by
an
eminent
architect
in
the
following
remarks
slightly
modified
from
the
original
he
observes
that
the
two
are
better
distinguished
by
an
attention
to
their
general
effects
than
to
the
minute
parts
peculiar
to
each
it
is
in
architecture
as
in
painting
beauty
depends
on
light
and
shade
and
they
are
caused
by
the
openings
or
projections
in
the
surface
if
these
tend
to
produce
horizontal
lines
the
building
must
be
deemed
grecian
however
whimsically
the
doors
and
windows
may
be
constructed
if
on
the
contrary
the
shadows
give
a
preference
to
perpendicular
lines
the
general
character
of
the
building
will
be
gothic
this
is
evident
from
the
large
houses
built
in
queen
reign
where
grecian
columns
were
introduced
yet
they
are
always
considered
as
gothic
buildings
in
our
modern
grecian
architecture
large
cornices
are
repeated
with
windows
ranged
perfectly
in
the
same
line
and
these
lines
often
more
strongly
marked
by
a
horizontal
fascia
there
are
few
breaks
of
any
great
depth
and
if
there
be
a
portico
the
shadow
made
by
the
columns
is
very
trifling
compared
with
that
broad
horizontal
shadow
proceeding
from
the
soffit
that
is
the
under
side
of
the
heads
of
apertures
architraves
and
the
corona
of
cornices
the
only
ornament
its
roof
will
admit
is
either
a
flat
pediment
departing
very
little
from
the
horizontal
or
a
dome
still
rising
from
a
horizontal
base
but
in
these
remarks
attention
is
chiefly
drawn
to
the
general
architectural
effects
of
style
independent
of
concomitant
circumstances
yet
it
is
hardly
necessary
to
do
more
than
call
on
the
experience
of
any
man
of
taste
to
show
that
position
adjacent
scenery
and
other
or
matters
will
modify
the
special
effect
of
any
style
in
regard
to
the
picturesque
and
also
those
of
a
general
character
a
gothic
erection
in
a
confined
situation
will
lose
most
of
its
beauties
while
one
of
a
grecian
character
may
be
especially
suitable
in
choosing
therefore
any
design
for
the
erection
of
a
new
building
or
alterations
in
one
already
in
existence
respect
should
be
had
to
the
natural
character
of
the
surrounding
country
the
aspects
in
regard
to
the
sun
and
prevalent
winds
the
extent
of
the
estate
or
grounds
on
which
the
building
is
to
be
erected
the
views
from
the
various
apartments
the
character
of
wood
plain
or
other
adjacent
and
last
but
of
equal
or
greater
importance
questions
in
reference
to
domestic
comfort
and
convenience
drainage
and
dry
soil
supply
of
water
and
a
variety
of
details
most
of
which
will
at
once
suggest
themselves
in
many
cases
the
choice
of
site
is
necessarily
fixed
by
previous
purchase
or
inheritance
of
the
land
yet
in
such
cases
chances
are
left
for
a
judicious
selection
in
regard
to
some
of
the
conditions
above
mentioned
but
when
the
purchase
has
to
be
effected
the
conditions
should
be
kept
in
mind
and
if
possible
completely
satisfied
such
details
should
form
the
subject
of
minute
inquiry
and
they
are
here
only
named
for
the
purpose
of
showing
how
the
choice
of
the
best
style
in
regard
either
to
general
beauty
or
picturesque
effect
should
be
decided
on
with
mature
attention
to
all
the
circumstances
of
the
case
most
of
the
old
mansions
of
this
country
and
many
parts
of
continental
europe
have
been
erected
in
situations
that
were
then
immediately
and
at
little
cost
available
for
the
purpose
at
one
time
the
choice
of
such
situation
depended
on
careful
attention
to
the
special
circumstances
of
those
who
erected
the
building
thus
it
is
found
generally
that
the
banks
of
the
rivers
as
affording
ready
and
cheap
means
of
carriage
by
the

were
mostly
chosen
hence
our
abbeys
monasteries
are
frequently
found
in
such
localities
baronial
castles
were
usually
erected
on
hills
the
height
of
which
tended
to
the
security
of
the

against
sudden
incursions
of
their

from
the
varied
character
of

has
arisen
that
great
variety
of
picturesque
beauty
that
distinguishes
the
ruins
which
abound
in
almost
every
county
throughout
the

and

of
the

such
ruins
architecturally
considered
in
relation
to
the
surrounding
circumstances
of
wood
vale
hill
and
dale
have
become
subjects
of
study
and
suggestion
to
modern
architects
and
models
constantly
adopted
at
the
present
time
in
certain
details
for
producing
new
designs
in
the
selection
of
these
or
of
any
other
style
however
burke
has
laid
down
in
his
essay
on
sublime
and
beautiful
an
excellent
rule
true
artist
should
put
a
generous
deceit
on
the
spectators
and
effect
the
noblest
designs
by
easy
methods
designs
that
are
vast
only
by
their
dimensions
are
always
the
sign
of
a
common
and
low
imagination
the
work
of
art
can
be
great
but
as
it
deceives
to
be
otherwise
is
the
prerogative
of
nature
it
will
thus
be
seen
that
to
obtain
the
highest
effect
of
the
picturesque
in
architecture
requires
an
educated
eye
a
refined
taste
great
experience
but
especially
a
keen
perception
of
all
the
conditions
on
the
fulfilment
of
which
the
most
successful
result
can
be
obtained
in
all
there
is
a
natural
love
of
unity
and
effect
montesquieu
in
his
dissertation
on
observes
symmetry
is
useful
to
the
soul
and
may
assist
her
functions
it
is
agreeable
to
her
but
wherever
it
is
useless
it
becomes
distasteful
because
it
takes
away
variety
therefore
things
that
are
seen
in
succession
ought
to
have
variety
for
our
soul
has
no
difficulty
in
seeing
them
those
on
the
contrary
that
we
see
at
one
glance
ought
to
have
symmetry
thus
at
one
glance
we
see
the
front
of
a
building
a
parterre
a
temple
in
such
things
there
is
always
a
symmetry
which
pleases
the
soul
by
the
facility
it
gives
her
of
taking
in
the
whole
object
at
the
numerous
dissertations
essays
that
have
been
produced
on
the
subjects
that
have
here
been
treated
on
in
a
discursive
manner
only
are
a
sufficient
proof
of
the
difficulty
which
exists
in
acquiring
applying
and
affording
an
accurate
and
ample
description
of
all
the
conditions
necessary
to
picturesque
architecture
they
also
in
some
measure
explain
the
reason
of
the
grotesque
and
even
offensive
results
that
obtrude
on
refined
taste
in
the
productions
of
builders
who
are
utterly
deficient
of
artistic
taste
and
knowledge
in
carrying
out
their
objects
a
general
and
in
part
a
historic
view
of
architecture
may
serve
to
show
how
success
has
been
attained
in
many
cases
and
the
evils
that
should
be
avoided
as
leading
to
failure
in
effect
of
the
general
and
special
features
of
an
erection
in
the
cursory
view
of
the
history
of
architecture
already
given
it
has
been
shown
that
the
earliest
efforts
of
the
art
were
simply
directed
to
satisfy
the
simple
wants
of
man
without
any
regard
being
had
to
taste
it
was
not
until
riches
began
to
accumulate
in
a
few
hands
that
taste
in
architecture
was
developed
and
by
the
few
examples
thus
produced
the
taste
of
society
at
large
was
educed
refined
and
extended
omitting
then
any
inquiry
into
the
architecture
of
our
aborigines
which
was
evidently
of
the
rudest
character
reference
may
first
be
made
to
early
architectural
attempts
in
asia
it
has
been
ingeniously
observed
by
pair
that
the
chinese
imitated
a
tent
as
the
model
of
their
system
a
result
that
undoubtedly
arose
from
the
fact
that
the
first
tartar
tribes
were
nomadic
or
wandering
in
their
nature
it
has
also
been
remarked
that
a
view
of
a
chinese
city
at
once
suggests
the
idea
of
a
fixed
camp
in
southern
and
asia
may
be
found
on
the
other
hand
the
remains
of
extensive
architectural
productions
in
caves
such
as
that
of
the
pagoda
elephanta
from
which
many
have
argued
that
subterraneous
dwellings
were
amongst
the
earliest
but
it
is
evident
that
such
could
only
be
made
in
places
where
stone
existed
in
masses
as
a
basis
of
the
country
in
a
plain
and
sandy
district
and
in
alluvial
soil
generally
such
could
not
possibly
have
been
produced
there
is
not
the
least
doubt
that
the
conditions
of
climate
have
in
all
cases
determined
the
early
character
of
each
national
system
in
both
hot
and
cold
countries
caves
would
naturally
have
been
sought
as
affording
shelter
from
the
two
extremes
of
heat
and
cold
recent
geological
discoveries
have
brought
to
light
the
fact
that
the
remains
of
human
and
quadruped
bones
have
been
found
together
in
such
situations
the
human
inhabitants
having
most
probably
been
the
predecessors
of
the
beasts
of
prey
as
also
of
the
fowls
of
the
air
it
has
been
suggested
too
that
the
forest
tree
having
formerly
served
for
shelter
might
have
suggested
the
floral
character
of
columns
and
the
use
of
floral
decoration
generally
at
their
summit
in
respect
to
these
and
consequently
primitive
of
architecture
billington
has
made
the
following
judicious
remarks
people
or
nations
who
lived
by
the
chase
and
in
the
same
class
the
ichthyophagi
or
are
included
could
not
for
a
great
length
of
time
have
built
themselves
shelters
the
long
courses
the
hunters
made
prevented
them
from
watching
their
property
which
must
have
comprised
but
few
articles
and
they
found
it
more
convenient
to
make
hollows
in
the
rocks
for
their
dwellings
or
to
profit
by
those
which
nature
offered
them
in
its
caverns
it
was
the
same
with
those
who
lived
by
fishing
passing
a
sedentary
life
on
the
sea
shores
the
sides
of
rivers
or
the
borders
of
the
lakes
they
always
made
themselves
such
abodes
or
took
advantage
of
those
already
formed
by
nature
the
little
industry
which
this
mode
of
life
required
and
the
natural
idleness
which
followed
it
was
sufficient
to
induce
them
to
prefer
the
dwellings
presented
by
nature
to
those
of
art
this
fact
is
proved
by
experience
at
the
present
day
as
these
descriptions
of
persons
continue
to
adopt
the
same
plan
of
life
in
countries
where
the
arts
of
civilization
have
not
extended
their
beneficial
influence
the
pastors
or
shepherds
as
they
were
inhabitants
of
plains
during
a
great
portion
of
the
year
could
not
make
use
of
the
retreats
hollowed
and
prepared
in
the
mountains
and
rocks
by
the
hand
of
nature
being
obliged
to
seek
change
of
pasture
and
thus
lead
an
ambulatory
life
it
was
requisite
to
have
dwellings
or
shelters
that
could
be
carried
with
them
wherever
they
went
and
hence
originated
the
use
of
tents
but
the
active
operations
of
agriculture
requiring
a
definite
situation
necessity
suggested
the
propriety
of
building
solid
and
fixed
abodes
the
agriculturist
then
living
on
his
own
grounds
and
in
the
enjoyment
of
his
property
had
to
store
his
provisions
it
was
therefore
necessary
to
have
a
habitation
at
once
commodious
safe
healthful
and
extensive
and
the
wood
hut
with
its
roof
was
soon
the
same
author
considers
that
there
is
not
the
least
certainty
of
this
primitive
wooden
construction
with
its
inclined
roof
having
been
the
universal
model
of
all
nations
but
especially
in
regard
to
egypt
and
china
the
peculiarities
of
the
early
chinese
style
of
architecture
have
been
already
named
and
with
the
persistent
continuity
in
one
course
yet
prevalent
that
style
is
still
preserved
but
the
grecian
style
was
evidently
founded
on
the
rude
model
and
the
ingenuity
of
that
nation
eventually
led
to
the
transference
of
material
from
wood
to
stone
at
the
present
day
the
orders
of
grecian
architecture
are
fundamental
to
the
principles
of
modern
art
in
numerous
varieties
of
detail
they
have
survived
the
prejudices
fancies
and
dicta
of
various
schools
of
art
although
as
already
shown
the
gothic
and
other
systems
have
become
formidable
competitors
and
in
many
cases
especially
in
regard
to
the
picturesque
efficient
elegant
and
ornamental
substitutes
the
taste
for
the
latter
characteristic
has
led
to
an
increased
adoption
for
example
of
the
italian
style
which
in
many
respects
resembles
the
grecian
but
differs
from
it
especially
in
lightness
of
detail
with
greater
variety
the
author
just
quoted
traces
the
origin
of
the
doric
order
of
the
greeks
to
a
primary
adaptation
of
the
trunks
of
trees
as
external
supports
of
the
wooden
dwelling
seeing
in
them
the
foreshadowing
of
the
column
designative
of
that
order
trees
are
of
greater
circumference
at
their
lower
extremities
and
diminish
in
rising
the
diminution
of
the
column
was
suggested
by
them
these
timbers
as
supports
consisting
of
trunks
of
trees
planted
in
the
ground
offered
not
as
yet
the
idea
of
bases
and
pedestals
as
is
seen
in
the
doric
order
which
is
without
base
but
in
the
course
of
time
the
inconvenience
of
this
method
was
perceived
as
it
exposed
the
wood
to
rot
and
to
remedy
this
inconvenience
pieces
of
wood
were
placed
under
each
support
to
give
it
a
better
foundation
and
to
protect
it
from
humidity
this
practice
may
be
traced
in
some
of
the
ancient
edifices
in
which
the
columns
have
no
other
base
than
a
block
of
stone
but
afterwards
the
number
of
pieces
of
wood
employed
for
the
base
was
increased
in
order
to
give
greater
elevation
to
the
supports
or
to
effect
better
security
against
the
effects
of
humidity
from
this
multiplication
of
blocks
as
footings
sprung
the
and
other
mouldings
of
the
base
an
origin
far
more
probable
than
that
of
ligaments
of
iron
as
imagined
by
scamozzi
and
others
it
is
also
more
conformable
to
the
nature
of
capitals
in
which
it
is
known
that
the
same
proceeding
was
employed
after
beginning
with
a
simple
abacus
several
others
were
afterwards
added
which
were
enlarged
as
they
rose
one
above
another
in
such
a
manner
that
as
the
base
was
to
the
column
a
kind
of
footing
on
which
it
rested
more
solidly
so
the
capital
made
a
head
more
capable
of
receiving
and
supporting
the
weight
and
form
of
the
architrave
a
large
beam
placed
horizontally
on
perpendicular
supports
and
destined
to
receive
the
covering
of
the
whole
the
author
goes
on
in
a
similarly
ingenious
manner
to
prove
the
derivation
from
nature
of
the
orders
of
grecian
architecture
he
ascribes
the
form
of
the
roof
as
having
necessarily
suggested
that
of
the
pediment
on
this
point
he
quotes
the
remark
of
cicero
is
not
to
pleasure
that
we
are
indebted
for
the
pediment
of
the
capitol
and
those
of
our
temples
necessity
suggested
the
form
for
the
better
draining
off
the
water
nevertheless
its
beauty
is
so
very
great
and
it
is
become
so
necessary
for
edifices
that
if
a
capitol
were
to
be
built
in
olympus
where
it
was
never
known
to
rain
it
would
notwithstanding
be
necessary
to
give
it
a
the
preceding
remarks
and
ingenious
theory
amply
justify
the
opinion
already
suggested
that
nature
must
be
the
foundation
of
every
true
principle
of
art
assuming
as
we
are
compelled
to
do
that
the
grecian
style
as
a
whole
was
original
the
only
perfect
model
that
could
have
been
selected
was
that
afforded
by
natural
objects
in
all
of
which
are
found
the
most
perfect
results
derived
from
few
means
but
answering
an
infinity
of
ends
it
will
be
remembered
that
the
construction
of
the
eddystone
lighthouse
was
based
in
regard
to
durability
and
resistance
to
the
force
of
the
waves
on
those
properties
which
are
possessed
by
any
kind
of
tree
exposed
to
the
full
force
of
the
tempest
ought
to
be
the
basis
of
all
proceeding
from
the
teachings
of
nature
the
greeks
learned
gradually
to
introduce
new
types
consistent
in
the
main
with
the
original
mode
but
of
great
variety
in
detail
by
further
refinement
of
this
but
close
adherence
to
the
facts
or
the
analogies
of
nature
the
grecian
art
became
developed
in
the
invention
of
other
orders
the
names
of
which
are
sufficiently
known
to
all
interested
in
architecture
limited
space
prevents
our
entering
into
a
class
of
analyses
of
the
characteristics
of
each
little
doubt
exists
of
the
doric
order
having
been
the
first
produced
and
following
it
were
the
ionic
corinthian
composite
and
tuscan
which
constitute
the
five
orders
in
general
of
architecture
perhaps
the
best
epoch
of
ancient
architecture
was
that
during
which
subsequent
to
the
battle
of
marathon
the
greeks
commenced
to
rebuild
the
remains
of
persian
buildings
and
to
athens
the
ruins
of
this
period
yet
with
us
attest
the
advance
which
grecian
architectural
art
had
attained
the
ingenuity
and
refinement
of
greek
art
gradually
spread
to
rome
the
romans
adopting
the
doric
order
under
the
modification
known
as
the
tuscan
the
art
having
been
introduced
into
etruria
by
the
pelasgi
under
the
celebrated
augustus
rome
attained
that
magnificence
which
has
ever
since
rendered
its
name
famous
as
a
seat
of
the
arts
amongst
the
great
erections
of
this
period
was
the
pantheon
one
of
the
grandest
efforts
of
genius
that
the
world
has
yet
known
under
subsequent
emperors
architecture
also
progressed
and
the
name
of
trajan
is
identified
with
the
erection
of
triumphal
arches
the
ruins
of
which
still
receive
the
admiration
of
every
qualified
judge
in
art
the
removal
of
the
seat
of
roman
government
to
byzantium
led
to
the
decadence
of
art
at
rome
which
was
completed
by
the
incursions
of
the
visigoths
eventually
the
gothic
style
arose
from
the
ruins
of
grecian
and
roman
art
and
obtained
a
place
that
has
rendered
it
ever
since
one
of
the
most
favourite
styles
of
architecture
just
as
under
the
heathens
the
art
had
been
chiefly
promoted
by
erections
for
religious
purposes
so
when
the
christians
began
to
obtain
the
ascendancy
the
erection
of
churches
led
to
a
similar
result
from
the
fourth
to
the
seventh
century
some
magnificent
buildings
of
this
kind
were
erected
at
the
commencement
of
the
eleventh
century
the
church
of
mark
at
venice
attested
the
wonderful
progress
which
architecture
had
made
and
it
continued
to
progress
during
the
next
two
or
three
centuries
being
confined
chiefly
however
to
italy
but
the
gothic
style
suited
to
a
northern
clime
never
obtained
full
hold
there
italy
can
not
boast
of
a
single
pure
gothic
edifice
gradually
the
new
style
spread
over
europe
the
cathedral
at
strasbourg
the
louvre
at
paris
suggested
improvements
in
our
own
country
at
windsor
castle
oxford
all
indicated
the
rapid
extension
of
the
gothic
style
or
its
modifications
but
in
numerous
instances
the
taste
that
was
exhibited
showed
a
decadence
from
the
simplicity
and
grandeur
of
the
grecian
and
latin
styles
in
respect
to
the
latter
indeed
the
materials
of
the
new
erections
were
obtained
from
the
ruins
of
the
ancient
edifices
the
columns
there
found
being
pressed
into
the
service
in
any
manner
of
the
new
school
of
architects
towards
the
middle
of
the
fifteenth
century
a
revival
in
architectural
art
took
place
especially
under
brunelleschi
the
patronage
of
the
medici
added
a
stimulus
to
the
progress
thus
initiated
improvements
were
introduced
in
the
erection
of
private
residences
in
most
parts
of
western
europe
the
art
having
in
its
best
form
been
chiefly
till
then
directed
to
building
edifices
for
religious
purposes
alone
in
the
sixteenth
century
architecture
in
rome
attained
a
perfection
nearly
equal
to
that
it
had
formerly
enjoyed
under
the
c√¶sars
especially
during
the
augustan
age
private
and
public
buildings
were
erected
of
great
magnificence
yet
of
simplicity
of
form
combined
with
grandeur
under
vignola
architecture
attained
great
excellence
michael
angelo
was
appointed
architect
of
at
rome
about
the
middle
of
the
sixteenth
century
and
the
mention
of
his
name
alone
is
sufficient
to
call
to
mind
the
extent
and
value
of
his
labours
in

and
other
noted
buildings
were
designed
about
this
period
in
france
and
other
continental
countries
architecture
attained
great
perfection
at
this
period
both
in
respect
to
public
and
private
buildings
among
the
most
eminent
architects
of
a
period
somewhat
nearer
to
our
own
time
was
sir
christopher
wren
whose
cathedral
serves
as
a
monument
to
the
great
genius
of
that
eminent
man
this
era
may
comparatively
speaking
be
considered
as
the
commencement
of
the
modern
style
of
english
church
architecture
inasmuch
as
several
productions
of
wren
are
still
used
for
the
purposes
to
which
they
were
first
applied
having
undergone
little
or
no
change
since
their
completion
such
is
a
brief
and
necessarily
very
imperfect
resum√©
of
the
progress
of
architecture
the
styles
of
eastern
europe
ancient
mexico
and
many
others
have
not
been
described
because
unnecessary
in
this
introduction
which
has
only
for
its
object
to
call
general
attention
to
the
causes
which
have
led
to
the
present
state
of
the
art
like
all
others
it
has
been
the
subject
of
alternating
prosperity
and
adversity
at
one
time
fostered
by
men
eminent
in
their
profession
and
by
those
whose
means
permitted
them
to
lavish
riches
on
magnificent
piles
fountains
villas
and
at
others
degraded
by
its
students
and
neglected
by
those
who
should
have
been
its
patrons
in
all
branches
of
architecture
direct
reference
should
be
had
to
the
objects
for
which
the
building
is
intended
an
eminent
architect
already
quoted
has
well
set
forth
this
essential
point
in
the
following
remarks
art
of
characterizing
that
is
to
say
of
rendering
evident
by
material
forms
the
intellectual
qualities
and
moral
ideas
required
to
express
in
edifices
or
to
make
known
by
the
harmony
and
suitableness
of
all
the
constituent
parts
that
enter
into
their
composition
the
use
for
which
they
are
intended
is
perhaps
of
all
the
secrets
of
architecture
the
most
difficult
to
develope
or
to
attain
this
happy
talent
of
conceiving
and
of
communicating
the
conception
in
the
physiognomy
suitable
to
each
edifice
this
sure
and
delicate
discernment
which
exhibits
the
distinguishing
parts
of
such
edifices
that
at
first
appear
susceptible
of
no
characteristic
distinctions
this
judicious
employment
of
the
different
styles
which
are
as
the
tones
of
architecture
this
skilful
application
of
the
signs
which
the
art
employs
to
affect
the
sight
and
understanding
this
exquisite
feeling
which
errs
neither
in
the
just
disposition
of
the
masses
and
employment
of
the
details
nor
in
the
just
dispensation
of
richness
and
simplicity
and
which
is
able
to
combine
true
expression
of
character
with
the
harmonious
accord
of
all
the
qualities
susceptible
of
being
represented
by
architecture
all
this
requisite
talent
which
study
perfects
but
does
not
produce
is
a
gift
possessed
by
few
this
suitable
expression
presents
itself
under
two
relations
the
one
appertaining
to
architecture
in
general
and
the
other
to
edifices
in
particular
the
first
consists
in
the
expression
of
the
qualities
or
intellectual
ideas
which
are
the
results
of
the
art
metaphysically
considered
the
second
in
the
true
indication
of
the
uses
for
which
edifices
are
designed
that
is
in
considering
architecture
as
a
certain
mode
of
expressing
or
painting
this
expression
according
to
the
nature
of
the
buildings
and
edifices
may
be
produced
by
the
gradation
of
richness
and
greatness
proportionate
to
the
nature
and
the
object
for
which
they
are
erected
by
the
indication
of
the
moral
qualities
attached
to
each
edifice
the
manner
of
expressing
which
is
beyond
the
reach
of
rules
by
the
general
and
particular
form
of
architecture
by
the
species
of
the
construction
and
the
quality
of
the
materials
that
may
be
employed
in
the
execution
and
lastly
by
the
resources
of
in
these
remarks
will
be
found
a
highly
valuable
of
the
excellence
to
which
the
art
of
the
architect
should
be
directed
and
the
means
that
must
be
adopted
to
obtain
pleasing
and
successful
results
the
erection
of
country
mansions
villas
and
other
residences
has
of
late
years
been
greatly
stimulated
in
our
country
the
enormous
annually
accumulated
savings
of
the
commercial
portion
of
the
community
have
induced
a
large
amount
of
capital
to
be
invested
in
such
objects
in
regard
to
questions
of
taste
and
decoration
it
should
be
borne
in
mind
that
but
very
little
extra
cost
is
incurred
in
building
a
residence
in
a
pleasing
and
picturesque
style
than
in
one
having
not
the
least
pretension
to
architectural
beauty
in
our
earlier
remarks
on
the
nature
of
the
picturesque
the
of
obtaining
that
effect
have
been
pointed
out
in
the
following
pages
the
special
details
are
amply
descanted
on
and
illustrated
by
designs
drawings
it
is
the
object
of
every
department
of
constructive
skill
at
the
present
day
to
endeavour
to
obtain
the
best
possible
result
by
the
least
possible
expenditure
of
material
and
thus
taste
actually
causes
economy
rather
than
increased
expense
tons
of
heavy
and
unsightly
materials
are
now
replaced
by
hundredweights
of
decorative
and
yet
substantial
masonry
and
iron
work
a
number
of
modern
elegant
erections
affording
accommodation
equal
in
extent
but
vastly
superior
in
quality
are
now
made
at
an
expenditure
of
stone
or
brick
less
by
in
quantity
than
was
employed
in
many
old
houses
those
in
high
street
edinburgh
by
way
of
example
the
result
has
been
arrived
at
by
the
joint
aid
of
science
and
art
the
former
giving
data
as
to
the
strength
of
the
material
and
the
latter
directing
its
disposal
the
peculiar
character
of
english
scenery
is
exactly
adapted
for
giving
a
picturesque
character
to
villa
residences
provided
the
latter
are
designed
and
erected
in
accordance
with
the
principles
of
sound
taste
surely
he
who
would
spend
money
in
building
a
house
in
which
all
or
most
of
the
remainder
of
his
days
are
to
be
spent
will
not
grudge
making
that
dwelling
the
subject
of
decoration
or
ornamental
art
by
which
its
aspect
shall
at
all
times
be
suggestive
of
pleasure
rather
than
of
aversion
or
disgust
it
has
been
said
that
most
individuals
by
long
association
together
acquire
a
mutuality
of
tastes
and
even
physical
resemblance
it
can
not
be
denied
that
even
inanimate
objects
such
as
our
dwellings
furniture
landscapes
gardens
and
other
such
surroundings
have
a
parallel
effect
on
us
hence
the
wisdom
of
using
all
the
means
which
architectural
art
places
at
our
disposal
errors
in
this
respect
often
proceed
from
thoughtlessness
if
not
from
want
of
refined
taste
an
instance
may
suffice
to
show
how
much
such
matters
should
be
attended
to
in
the
choice
of
a
site
and
other
conditions
a
retired
manufacturer
erected
a
mansion
at
a
cost
exceeding
fifty
thousand
pounds
and
had
never
paid
any
heed
to
the
fact
that
the
most
prominent
object
seen
from
his
window
was
the
cemetery
of
the
adjacent
town
soon
this
became
unbearable
and
the
house
has
been
comparatively
deserted
by
the
family
caused
by
an
oversight
that
the
least
consideration
would
have
remedied
the
designs
given
in
the
following
pages
have
for
their
object
to
suggest
the
most
approved
tasteful
and
effective
plans
for
the
mansion
the
villa
or
cottage
and
great
care
has
been
devoted
to
their
production
whilst
a
residence
must
necessarily
be
kept
within
a
cost
suitable
to
the
means
of
the
proprietor
by
judicious
care
of
the
professional
man
possessed
of
a
competent
knowledge
a
little
money
may
go
a
long
way
in
the
decorative
art
many
of
the
drawings
are
devoted
to
the
minor
but
not
less
effective
portions
of
the
house
congruity
in
detail
inside
the
dwelling
is
equally
required
with
symmetry
beauty
or
picturesque
character
of
the
exterior
want
of
judgment
in
this
point
may
speedily
convert
the
most
elegant
building
into
little
better
than
a
repository
for
gewgaws
selected
without
taste
and
arranged
without
skill
it
is
impossible
for
man
to
become
his
own
architect
but
it
is
possible
in
most
cases
for
all
who
have
the
means
to
select
such
a
design
as
shall
best
comport
with
their
taste
leaving
the
working
out
of
details
to
the
architect
but
a
remote
possibility
exists
of
an
unprofessional
being
able
even
to
state
what
he
requires
and
should
he
ask
an
architect
for
a
design
or
plan
it
is
more
than
likely
that
the
latter
would
fail
to
please
when
however
a
variety
of
designs
is
placed
before
the
eye
of
any
intelligent
person
the
act
of
selection
becomes
easy
although
no
single
plan
may
succeed
a
combination
may
suggest
itself
and
the
architect
can
then
readily
work
on
something
like
a
sound
foundation
and
with
the
hope
of
success
this
work
is
intended
to
supply
such
requirements
again
in
building
a
house
or
in
effecting
alterations
in
an
old
one
points
apparently
of
minor
but
really
of
great
importance
require
attention
a
badly
constructed
chimney
will
make
the
whole
house
miserable
independent
of
the
injury
done
to
furniture
decorations
and
the
destruction
of
paint
and
paperhangings
a
defective
drainage
may
render
that
which
was
intended
to
be
an
abode
of
peace
plenty
and
happiness
a
living
or
the
door
to
the
grave
a
question
of
vital
importance
is
that
of
ventilation
these
apparently
minor
questions
can
therefore
scarcely
be
exaggerated
in
their
value
for
neglect
of
them
will
render
nugatory
the
best
external
efforts
of
the
architect
hence
they
have
hereafter
full
attention
in
their
practical
details
directed
to
them
on
the
general
principles
of
ventilation
the
following
remarks
may
be
of
value
to
all
who
propose
to
erect
new
dwellings
or
alter
those
already
inhabited
in
all
houses
and
in
fact
every
building
divided
into
stories
a
ready
means
of
ventilation
may
be
insured
or
rather
always
exists
this
is
presented
in
the
opening
formed
by
the
staircase
into
this
general
opening
communications
can
be
made
into
and
from
each
apartment
by
apertures
placed
in
some
convenient
position
in
each
room
the
grand
law
on
which
ventilation
depends
is
that
hot
air
being
lighter
than
cool
air
has
a
universal
tendency
to
rise
whilst
cold
air
takes
the
lowest
part
of
a
house
or
apartment
it
hence
follows
that
if
a
supply
of
cold
air
be
admitted
by
an
opening
at
the
lower
part
of
a
house
and
it
becomes
heated
within
the
house
it
will
have
a
tendency
to
rise
to
the
roof
and
if
a
sufficient
opening
be
there
provided
it
will
escape
into
the
open
air
consequently
a
constant
current
may
thus
be
obtained
in
any
dwelling
sufficient
to
give
a
supply
of
pure
air
and
to
remove
that
which
has
been
vitiated
by
breathing
the
combustion
of
fires
and
other
causes
the
heavy
atmosphere
of
this
country
requires
assistance
to
make
this
grand
law
operative
to
cause
the
air
of
a
room
to
move
as
readily
as
it
is
required
forced
ventilation
becomes
necessary
the
english
fireplace
provides
this
and
to
that
it
owes
with
us
its
extreme
popularity
a
constant
current
of
air
from
the
room
is
heated
and
passed
up
the
chimney
flue
and
this
draws
in
a
corresponding
supply
of
cold
air
and
proper
and
convenient
apertures
should
be
left
to
permit
this
to
enter
the
fireplace
forces
attention
to
the
necessity
if
sufficient
fresh
air
be
not
provided
for
it
the
smoke
enters
the
room
and
drives
the
occupants
out
notwithstanding
the
attention
that
has
been
paid
to
the
stove
and
its
flue
we
are
still
sadly
behindhand
in
a
proper
construction
of
them
the
flues
could
be
so
arranged
that
a
building
might
be
enabled
using
a
figurative
expression
to
breathe
whenever
its
principal
flue
that
of
the
kitchen
fireplace
was
in
action
a
construction
to
effect
this
will
be
illustrated
in
the
text
in
conclusion
on
this
point
it
may
be
added
that
nothing
is
more
essential
to
the
health
and
comfort
of
a
house
than
that
it
should
be
thoroughly
and
constantly
ventilated
and
if
any
portion
is
to
be
particularized
it
should
be
the
sleeping
apartments
another
question
which
to
a
certain
extent
should
influence
the
arrangement
of
a
house
of
any
pretensions
in
respect
to
size
is
that
of
the
method
of
warming
it
the
preference
or
rather
prejudice
in
favour
of
fireplaces
is
so
great
that
a
revolution
of
the
nation
in
political
matters
could
be
more
easily
brought
about
than
the
abolition
of
the
but
it
is
well
known
that
at
least
of
the
coal
consumed
is
wasted
in
the
attempt
to
heat
the
room
to
an
equable
and
pleasant
temperature
but
by
such
means
the
result
can
not
be
arrived
at
in
front
of
and
close
to
the
fire
the
temperature
is
excessive
while
the
backs
of
the
sitters
facing
in
are
suffering
from
cold
an
equalized
temperature
in
rooms
is
obtained
abroad
in
russia
a
plan
is
adopted
of
heating
the
rooms
by
means
of
the
walls
the
latter
being
double
and
so
arranged
that
they
act
as
flues
to
a
furnace
situated
at
the
lower
part
of
the
building
by
this
method
every
part
of
the
room
acquires
simultaneously
an
equable
temperature
there
need
be
no
draught
simply
because
the
air
is
not
drawn
in
one
direction
more
than
in
another
from
every
side
a
gentle
current
of
warm
air
arises
this
method
can
not
be
adopted
here
it
would
not
suit
for
english
houses
where
coal
is
used
as
fuel
the
interstices
of
the
double
wall
would
soon
be
filled
with
soot
the
same
effect
is
produced
in
a
far
more
elegant
way
by
means
of
pipes
passed
round
the
room
by
this
simple
process
the
staircase
and
passages
and
the
sides
of
a
room
distant
from
the
fireplace
are
made
of
equal
temperature
one
or
at
most
two
furnaces
burning
coke
and
making
no
smoke
if
placed
in
a
cellar
outside
an
extensive
building
can
render
the
whole
interior
from
attic
to
of
equal
temperature
and
not
prevent
the
action
of
the
fireplace
or
its
agreeable
presence
in
our
homes
in
the
british
museum
where
warming
apparatus
is
used
the
temperature
of
the
whole
is
kept
uniformly
the
same
that
is
even
throughout
the
most
severe
weather
independent
of
the
common
fireplace
no
greater
change
is
required
in
any
part
of
our
buildings
than
in
the
latter
not
that
it
requires
to
be
removed
but
a
change
to
prevent
its
waste
of
heat
and
its
contaminating
the
outside
air
with
the
soot
and
blacks
from
its
coal
fuel
the
lower
fireplaces
in
a
building
should
warm
or
air
the
upper
rooms
and
no
soot
or
blacks
should
be
allowed
to
leave
the
flues
a
construction
for
this
purpose
will
be
shown
in
the
ensuing
pages
as
well
as
one
for
warming
an
entire
building
and
a
conservatory
an
opposite
effect
to
that
of
warming
is
frequently
desirable
in
our
houses
and
to
ensure
this
the
position
of
the
site
of
the
house
must
be
considered
it
is
evident
that
a
room
having
a
aspect
must
of
all
others
be
the
warmest
whether
in
winter
or
summer
simply
because
that
aspect
is
most
exposed
to
the
influence
of
the
rays
on
the
other
hand
rooms
having
a
aspect
must
necessarily
be
the
coolest
because
except
during
the
earliest
part
of
midsummer
mornings
say
from
to
the
rays
can
not
reach
them
it
is
therefore
in
the
power
of
those
who
have
the
requisite
resources
to
construct
a
house
in
such
a
manner
that
warm
rooms
can
be
provided
for
winter
use
and
cool
for
alleviating
the
heat
of
summer
it
is
by
no
means
an
uncommon
occurrence
to
find
a
large
assembled
in
the
heat
of
summer
in
a
room
that
has
been
exposed
to
the
rays
during
the
afternoon
frequently
in
such
cases
owing
to
the
number
of
persons
present
the
heat
of
the
viands
lights
the
temperature
rises
above
a
circumstance
prejudicial
to
health
enjoyment
and
the
vivacity
of
social
intercourse
that
might
have
been
entirely
avoided
had
the
been
placed
in
a
northern
aspect
these
are
points
well
worthy
of
attention
in
constructing
a
dwelling
it
unfortunately
happens
in
many
cases
that
the
supposed
exigencies
of
architectural
arrangement
must
have
priority
of
all
other
considerations
yet
the
architect
who
wilfully
opposes
such
modifications
of
his
plan
for
the
purpose
of
conducing
to
general
comfort
is
shortsighted
his
object
ought
to
be
to
build
a
house

lived
and
not
be
looked
alone
a
few
remarks
on
some
of
the
general
principles
that
should
lead
to
a
choice
of
site
situation
and
other
matters
may
not
be
without
advantage
whatever
inducement
a
plot
of
ground
for
building
purposes
may
possess
the
great
question
which
has
first
to
be
solved
is
that
of
a
clayey
soil
bog
marsh
or
stagnant
water
a
low
level
an
undrained
or
badly
drained
surface
a
moist
atmosphere
or
exposure
to
the
chill
north
and
east
winds
are
all
objections
that
a
question
of
price
should
never
be
pitted
against
popular
knowledge
on
sanitary
subjects
is
now
so
extensively
diffused
that
healthy
localities
are
always
of
ready
sale
while
those
of
an
opposite
character
are
frequently
unsold
in
the
market
and
consequently
may
be
had
at
a
low
price
but
are
really
never
cheap
nothing
can
counterbalance
the
value
of
a
healthy
locality
for
in
the
end
one
of
an
opposite
character
becomes
far
more
costly
the
timbers
of
the
building
fall
rapidly
into
decay
and
require
renewal
the
decorative
portion
internally
and
externally
becomes
faded
doors
and
windows
cease
to
fit
and
work
accurately
the
iron
work
becomes
rusted
and
requires
frequent
renewal
of
paint
or
other
protecting
coat
and
the
same
may
be
remarked
in
regard
to
the
fences
of
the
estate
the
position
of
the
residence
in
regard
to
the
sun
at
different
periods
of
the
year
is
also
an
important
matter
if
it
stands
with
each
front
north
and
south
the
north
front
will
have
comparatively
little
sun
except
during
summer
time
and
if
the
position
be
and
respectively
the
cold
bitter
winds
of
winter
will
be
severely
felt
whilst
from
the
fact
that
the
greater
portion
of
the
year
the
rainy
quarter
of
the
wind
is
that
front
or
back
of
the
house
will
be
continually
exposed
to
its
influence
consequently
frontages
to
the
and
are
to
be
preferred
in
all
cases
when
possible
as
such
position
ensures
to
both
sides
the
greatest
average
of
sun
heat
and
light
and
protection
from
the
wind
of
winter
or
the
of
the
rainy
season
comparatively
little
attention
has
been
paid
to
the
influence
of
light
on
health
and
its
effects
on
the
mind
in
the
construction
of
modern
an
excess
is
easily
avoided
by
blinds
and
other
contrivances
but
if
the
architectural
features
of
the
building
be
such
as
to
exclude
the
light
an
opposite
remedy
is
impossible
abundant
access
of
light
tends
to
set
off
all
the
internal
decorations
of
the
house
and
spreads
a
cheerfulness
of
appearance
that
is
always
highly
prized
it
gives
brilliancy
of
outline
and
detail
to
coloured
decorations
and
to
use
a
common
phrase
is
the
best
possible
that
the
architect
or
decorator
can
desire
as
already
pointed
out
the
effect
of
light
and
shade
in
regard
to
architecture
is
a
condition
of
success
in
respect
to
the
picturesque
it
is
always
desirable
that
a
house
should
be
placed
on
an
eminence
it
becomes
thus
a
prominent
object
and
its
qualities
are
the
more
readily
perceived
a
gradual
ascent
to
the
house
by
the
walks
or
drive
adds
much
to
the
general
effect
the
walks
are
thus
constantly
drained
and
preserve
longer
a
neat
appearance
a
matter
which
is
of
much
importance
in
setting
off
the
advantages
of
situation
site
in
respect
to
questions
of
health
also
this
is
of
great
advantage
as
the
waste
matter
of
the
household
more
readily
falls
away
by
its
own
gravity
and
is
thus
quickly
removed
which
if
left
stagnant
would
be
productive
of
harm
to
the
inmates
abundant
access
of
fresh
air
is
of
great
importance
to
health
in
a
residence
unnecessary
exposure
to
wind
being
at
the
same
time
to
be
avoided
hence
to
place
a
residence
in
the
centre
of
a
close
array
of
trees
is
not
desirable
not
only
is
the
access
of
air
light
and
heat
prevented
but
there
is
always
a
tendency
induced
to
dampness
in
the
house
in
an
open
airy
and
well
drained
situation
the
effects
of
even
wet
are
soon
dispelled
but
when
all
sides
of
a
house
are
surrounded
closely
by
trees
an
opposite
result
is
induced
and
in
comparatively
dry
situations
many
evils
of
a
damp
one
ultimately
ensue
one
of
our
earliest
english
writers
on
building
thomas
fuller
speaking
of
the
choice
of
situation
for
a
new
structure
says
choose
a
wholesome
for
air
is
a
dish
one
feeds
on
every
minute
and
therefore
it
need
be
good
wherefore
great
men
who
may
build
where
they
please
as
poor
men
where
they
can
if
herein
they
prefer
their
profit
above
their
health
i
refer
them
to
their
physicians
to
make
them
pay
for
it
and
as
to
light
he
continues
eldest
daughter
is
a
principal
beauty
in
a
yet
it
shines
not
alike
from
all
parts
of
heaven
an
east
window
welcomes
the
infant
beams
of
the
sun
before
they
are
of
strength
to
do
any
harm
and
is
offensive
to
none
but
a
sluggard
a
south
window
in
summer
is
a
chimney
with
a
fire
in
it
and
needs
the
screen
of
a
curtain
in
a
west
window
in
summer
time
towards
night
the
sun
grows
low
and
ever
familiar
with
more
light
than
delight
a
north
window
is
best
for
butteries
and
cellars
where
the
beer
will
not
be
sour
for
the
smiling
on
it
thorough
lights
are
best
for
rooms
of
entertainment
and
windows
on
one
side
for
and
he
tells
us
pleasant
prospect
is
to
be
a
medley
view
such
as
of
water
and
land
at
greenwich
best
entertains
the
eyes
refreshing
the
wearied
beholder
with
exchange
of
objects
yet
he
adds
know
a
more
profitable
prospect
where
the
owner
can
only
see
his
own
land
round
having
thus
disposed
of
some
of
the
most
important
points
that
should
be
kept
in
mind
when
choosing
the
site
of
a
house
and
of
such
other
conditions
as
affect
its
picturesque
and
sanitary
character
a
small
space
may
be
devoted
to
the
consideration
of
its
internal
decorations
on
this
point
there
is
no
disputing
about
tastes
but
to
this
may
be
added
that
the
absence
of
taste
is
by
no
means
uncommon
having
fixed
on
the
style
of
house
the
next
question
for
decision
in
respect
to
its
general
effect
should
be
that
of
its
internal
decoration
congruity
of
design
should
exist
between
the
two
for
if
an
opposite
course
be
adopted
a
vulgarity
will
be
introduced
that
will
be
highly
displeasing
to
good
taste
on
the
other
hand
a
slavish
adherence
to
uniformity
of
internal
with
external
character
might
produce
so
severe
an
adherence
to
system
as
to
exclude
the
benefits
that
arise
from
judiciously
chosen
contrast
what
has
before
been
remarked
in
regard
to
the
exterior
applies
equally
to
the
interior
of
a
house
each
should
have
in
its
general
effect
an
agreement
in
appearance
to
its
objects
in
an
antique
apartment
the
light
character
of
modern
furniture
would
be
evidently
out
of
place
and
it
is
evidently
impossible
to
direct
attention
to
more
than
a
few
elements
of
success
that
may
be
arrived
at
in
internal
decoration
independently
of
this
each
person
has
his
own
views
on
the
matter
that
would
be
sure
in
the
end
to
overrule
any
exact
principles
or
at
least
greatly
modify
them
the
following
observations
however
are
offered
suggestively
the
facility
with
which
the
most
beautiful
designs
in
painting
are
transferred
to
paper
for
paper
hangings
has
brought
these
into
very
extensive
use
for
decorative
purposes
formerly
the
best
patterns
were
produced
in
france
alone
but
of
late
years
the
british
manufactures
have
rivalled
the
continental
the
pattern
in
respect
to
size
colour
design
should
be
so
chosen
as
to
be
in
accordance
with
the
amount
of
light
the
size
and
other
conditions
of
the
room
a
large
pattern
in
a
small
room
is
equally
out
of
place
with
the
reverse
condition
a
light
pattern
again
in
a
dark
room
although
advantageous
in
alleviating
sombreness
is
also
incongruous
the
general
effect
of
a
room
on
a
spectator
is
thus
largely
influenced
by
these
points
and
consequently
they
should
be
carefully
attended
to
frequently
paint
is
preferred
for
covering
walls
of
apartments
and
where
many
pictures
are
introduced
this
may
be
advantageously
employed
because
the
paintings
alleviate
the
monotonous
effect
that
would
otherwise
ensue
painted
walls
are
liable
to
injury
by
peeling
off
in
places
especially
where
likely
to
meet
with
blows
from
furniture
in
damp
weather
from
the
absorption
of
heat
they
generally
become
not
only
wet
but
frequently
stream
with
water
if
the
apartment
is
lines
of
sooty
hue
soon
follow
and
the
room
acquires
a
dirty
appearance
this
is
avoided
by
the
use
of
paper
which
prevents
the
abstraction
of
heat
and
the
consequent
deposition
of
water
beautiful
effects
may
be
produced
by
graining
and
other
devices
which
are
too
well
known
to
require
enumeration
when
flock
paper
on
walls
becomes
dirty
and
requires
renewing
if
painted
it
looks
extremely
well
a
diaper
ornamental
surface
being
produced
by
such
means
the
of
a
room
adds
to
or
detracts
from
its
general
effect
in
a
well
lighted
apartment
with
light
furniture
white
marble
is
decidedly
preferable
whereas
serpentine
black
or
coloured
marbles
grey
and
even
red
granite
may
all
agree
in
rooms
but
moderately
lighted
the
cornice
and
ceiling
decorations
equally
require
adaptation
to
the
character
of
the
apartment
for
these
purposes
beautiful
designs
have
been
suggested
and
employed
the
material
of
which
they
are
usually
made
is
so
plastic
as
to
be
capable
of
receiving
and
retaining
the
most
intricate
forms
conducive
to
elegance
and
beauty
in
some
rooms
such
add
greatly
to
the
general
effect
while
in
others
especially
with
painted
walls
plain
mouldings
seem
most
appropriate
a
profusion
of
gold
or
gilding
displays
want
of
taste
a
glaring
example
of
this
might
be
pointed
out
a
white
marble
supported
by
gilt
angels
five
feet
high
which
the
of
a
mansion
in
one
part
of
this
country
the
outer
room
is
a
gorgeous
display
of
gold
silver
and
vulgarity
it
serves
however
to
point
out
at
once
the
riches
and
of
the
owner
on
the
other
hand
paintings
and
engravings
in
gilt
frames
have
an
excellent
effect
in
setting
off
a
room
provided
that
their
size
is
in
accordance
with
that
of
the
apartment
stained
deals
varnished
afford
a
good
material
for
panelling
and
for
covering
the
walls
of
rooms
we
have
in
our
eye
a
thus
fitted
which
has
an
effect
approaching
to
some
of
the
oaken
fittings
of
olden
times
the
material
is
cheap
and
durable
whilst
the
surface
can
always
be
renewed
in
its
freshness
by
a
new
coat
of
varnish
it
has
been
largely
adopted
in
churches
for
pews
and
other
fittings
with
the
best
possible
results
the
minor
objects
of
decoration
such
as
handles
can
only
be
here
named
in
many
instances
designs
are
given
in
the
following
pages
suggesting
the
most
suitable
either
for
indoor
or
outdoor
use
according
to
the
character
of
the
room
or
entrance
for
which
they
are
intended
so
much
for
the
picturesque
exterior
and
tasteful
interior
of
a
house
a
few
words
however
may
be
said
in
respect
to
its
immediate
surroundings
such
as
the
lawns
gardens
pleasure
grounds
the
most
picturesque
villa
would
be
a
nonentity
in
a
wrong
situation
it
would
be
opposed
to
what
is
usually
called
the
of
things
a
phrase
that
expresses
much
meaning
without
an
exact
definition
hence
has
become
an
almost
necessary
adjunct
to
the
art
of
architecture
an
unframed
picture
has
possibly
every
merit
that
the
art
can
bestow
on
it
yet
it
lacks
that
finish
which
the
exterior
confers
on
it
so
the
well
garden
the
vista
at
its
extremity
the
carefully
arranged
parterre
the
judicious
management
of
floral
culture
especially
with
regard
to
colour
neatly
arranged
walks
and
many
other
exterior
matters
of
detail
add
to
enhance
and
occasionally
become
indispensable

belongs
to

secluded

some
sequestered
spot
of

may
designate
as
that
of
some
beautiful

where
the
limpid
crystal
flows
in

yet
ceaseless
streams

to
the
sick
and
solace

a
vignette
at

of

of

details

belong
to

not
be

practical

was
formerly
in

is
now

constructed
of

james
flitcroft
sent
in
a
view
of
the
villa
to
the
and
thus
described
the
construction
of
such
houses
in
the
locality
the
walls
are
carried
above
the
ground
two
and
sometimes
three
feet
to
prevent
the
damp
from
rising
to
the
mud
which
if
wetted
would
scale
off
by
the
action
of
frost
the
kind
of
earth
used
is
fine
chalk
dug
from
the
surface
if
timely
notice
of
any
building
will
permit
it
is
best
dug
in
winter
that
the
frost
may
act
upon
it
buildings
formed
of
this
material
can
be
erected
only
in
dry
warm
weather
the
workmen
in
preparing
this
chalk
for
use
put
about
a
cartload
of
it
together
throw
water
over
it
and
tread
it
with
their
feet
turn
it
over
again
tread
and
turn
it
until
it
begins
to
bind
something
like
loamy
clay
then
let
it
soak
a
little
while
when
it
is
ready
for
use
the
waller
is
able
to
put
on
a
layer
of
about
fifteen
inches
he
begins
at
one
corner
and
goes
round
the
building
putting
one
layer
on
another
taking
care
that
the
lower
one
is
sufficiently
dry
to
bear
the
upper
in
buildings
of
two
stories
high
the
walls
are
generally
eighteen
inches
thick
when
the
walls
are
got
up
five
or
six
feet
and
pretty
dry
the
quoins
are
plumbed
and
the
walls
dressed
down
a
little
in
order
that
the
waller
may
see
what
he
is
about
a
small
short
spade
is
the
best
tool
for
this
purpose
with
short
handle
and
rather
bent
the
work
is
then
proceeded
with
as
before
until
it
is
raised
up
to
the
square
of
the
building
when
the
illustration
elevation

get
their
general
dressing
ready
to
receive
their
coating
flitcroft
describes
rose
hill
villa
as
coated
with
stone
and
drawn
the
columns
of
the
villa
are
of
brick
he
states
that
there
are
several
other
buildings
of
this
kind
at
stockbridge
winchester
and
other
places
in
the
neighbourhood
he
describes
a
better
method
of
constructing
such
walls
by
the
use
of
a
moveable
trough
or
box
about
feet
in
length
by
inches
in
depth
this
trough
rests
on
bearers
put
across
the
wall
with
a
mortice
at
each
end
wide
enough
apart
to
receive
the
sides
and
the
thickness
of
the
wall
in
these
are
inserted
uprights
to
prevent
the
sides
giving
way
with
others
to
go
across
the
top
this
mode
of
construction
is
however
very
ancient
and
when
done
on
a
large
scale
the
primitive
method
is
still
pursued
this
method
is
shown
in
the
preceding
engraving
which
gives
an
elevation
and
section
of
a
wall
in
process
of
construction
with
the
posts
the
moveable
planking
and
cross
pieces
it
will
be
seen
that
three
courses
of
bricks
are
put
about
every
five
feet
in
height
the

here

from
a
very

was

a
very
common
method
of
forming
partitions
and
even
roofs
in
some
of
the
agricultural
districts
in
hampshire
is
first
to
put
them
up
with
strong
wattle
hurdles
they
are
double
the
size
of
the
common
hurdle
and
made
of
a
thicker
material
when
in
their
place
they
are
plastered
over
with
concrete
and
made
about
four
inches
in
thickness
they
very
often
require
repair
it
is
said
that
concrete
walls
are
subject
to
contraction
and
expansion
and
speedily
show
vertical
cracks
at
intervals
which
in
our
damp
climate
would
soon
permit
the
wet
to
enter
there
can
be
no
question
as
to
its
strength
as
a
building
material
as
some
experiments
conducted
by
the
institute
of
british
architects
gave
the
following
results
composed
of
two
parts
of
lime
parts
of
sand
and
five
parts
of
cement
can
resist
a
crushing
weight
of
four
tons
to
the
square
inch
being
twice
the
strength
of
portland
stone
eight
times
the
strength
of
bath
stone
and
sixteen
times
the
strength
of
in
constructing
cottages
with
concrete
everything
depends
upon
the
goodness
of
the
cement
and
the
care
with
which
it
is
used
the
occupiers
of
these
cottages
are
frequently
their
own
operators
the
work
is
generally
too
speedily
performed
and
the
consequence
is
that
the
fruits
of
their
labour
are
in
most
instances
of
but
short
duration
for
obvious
reasons
it
is
necessary
that
the
greatest
economy
should
be
observed
in
the
construction
of
cottages
and
for
these
reasons
the
apartments
should
always
be
on
the
ground
floor
which
will
render
it
unnecessary
to
build
them
more
than
eight
or
nine
feet
high
where
mud
walls
are
introduced
the
lower
they
are
made
the
better
in
which
case
they
should
be
made
to
batir
on
the
outside
so
as
to
resist
the
pressure
of
the
roof
the
covering
of
which
should
project
as
much
as
possible
to
throw
off
the
wet
and
protect
the
walls
the
chimney
flues
in
these
clay
and
concrete
walls
are
formed
of
which
answer
admirably
these
humble
dwellings
should
be
paved
with
paving
laid
on
sand
which
is
much
warmer
and
more
conducive
to
health
than
any
sort
of
rough
flagging
plaster
mud
or
concrete
floor
the
latter
although
much
cheaper
can
never
be
made
to
look
clean
foundations
of
clay
or
concrete
walls
should
be
of
brick
a
few
courses
above
the
surface
and
the
walls
when
dry
should
be
covered
with
a
thick
coat
of
plaster
consisting
of
lime
and
sand
or
what
is
still
better
a
coating
of
good
portland
cement
this
ought
constantly
to
be
kept
perfect
as
everything
depends
upon
the
goodness
of
the
work
concrete
improperly
mixed
is
not
so
strong
as
brickwork
but
is
mere
rubbish
but
when
perfectly
done
it
hardens
with
age
becoming
like
stone
impervious
both
to
wet
and
frost

were

be
an
extra
expense
over
the
common
method

construct

the
advantage
to
be
gained
would
be
their
character
in

the
high
tenacious
power
of
good
cement
is
repeatedly
it
may
be
said
commonly
taken
advantage
of
in
the
construction
of
roofs
these
are
formed
by
cementing
plain
tiles
and
they
have
considerable
strength
roofs
of
feet
span
constructed
in
segmental
form
rising
three
feet
and
only
of
three
plain
tiles
in
thickness
successfully
resist
great
pressure
and
are
durable
in
a
very
superior
degree
but
they
require
to
be
well
tied
in
and
formed
between
iron
girders
connected
together
with
iron
tie
rods
otherwise
they
sink
and
force
out
the

roofs
of
cemented
tiles
have
been
constructed
from
to

and
have
been
found
to
answer
well
bond
laid
at
intervals
between
the
tiles
is
a
great
advantage
the
tenacious
power
of
good
cement
was
proved
in
a
very
high
degree
a
few
years
ago
by
brunel
in
the
construction
of
two
built
of
brick
springing
from
a
pier

abutment
feet
in

one
extended
feet
in
length
the
other
the
rise
of
the
arches
was

the
width
only
feet
inches
a
weight
of
about
tons
was
suspended
to
the
extremity
of
the
shorter
arch
without
breaking
it
the
result
of
this
test
proved
that
arches
of
feet
or
feet
span
and
probably
more
might
be
constructed
in
the
same
manner
at
very
moderate
expense
without
centering
bond
is
said
to
nearly
double
the
strength
or
holding
power
of
the
cement
flat
experimental
beams
have
been
constructed
of
brick
and
cement
with
bond
laid
horizontally
between
the
joints
or
courses
of
the
brickwork
which
have
given
equally
extraordinary
results
concrete
for
walling
was
extensively
used
in
england
at
the
beginning
of
the
present
century
it
got
into
bad
repute
through
failure
of
a
river
wall
at
woolwich
where
it
was
either
badly
done
some
mistake
was
made
or
it
was
unsuited
to
the
position
the
wall
was
constructed
of
blocks
of
concrete
cast
in
moulds
and
submitted
to
pressure
while
setting
a
coating
of
fine
stuff
being
applied
for

ample
time
having
been
allowed
for
the

to
set

were

course
being

rough
concrete
thrown
in
to
complete
its
thickness
and
that
of
the
counterforts
after
a
frost
it
was
found
that
this
wall
was
seriously
damaged
hardly
a
single
block
having
escaped
and
in
many
cases
their
whole
face
had
peeled
off
to
the
depth
of
half
an
inch
the
discharge
of
a
drain
from
a
height
of

feet
had
worn
away
the
lower
courses
to
the
depth
of
some
inches
on
a
like
wall
at
chatham
similar
but
much
more
severe
effects
were
produced
the
failure
of
this
wall
costing
about
was
a
serious
matter
and
for
several
years
after
architects
looked
upon
concrete
as
being
so
much
uneatable
hasty
pudding
considering
that
it
was
only
beneficial
when
confined
in

it
is
placed
in
the
centre
of
the
land
so
as
to
have
large
open
grounds
surrounding

these
at
any
time
could
have
been
covered
up
for
the
purpose
of
national

by
putting

of
the

floor
of
the
new

about
ten
feet
above
that
of

a
would
have
been
obtained
over
feet
in

affording
ample
space
for
arranging

as
well
as
for

a

for
any
special

and
affording
room
likewise
for
all
minor

the

was
to

of
the
mass
of

a
portion
of
the

is
seen
in

at

was
to
be
made
feet
in

two
galleries
for

each
feet
in

and
feet
in

were
to
be
placed
on

of
the
central

the

from

british

were
to
be
deposited
in

the
various

were
to
occupy
the
illustration
view
of
gate
hyde
park
with
the
national
gallery
and
other
buildings
as
suggested
by
his
royal
highness
the
late
prince
consort
each
having
its
meeting
and
lecture
room
and
all
necessary
offices
and
apartments
the
public
were
to
enter
at
the
porticoes
seen
in
the
view
and
the
carriages
of
the
professors
at
the
gateways
in
front
two
roads
were
proposed
traversing
the
ground
from
north
to
south
and
giving
easy
access
for
vehicles
to
every
part
of
the
building
in
the
small
block
plan
attached
to
the
view
placed
on
the
upper
corner
is
the
prince
road
the
exhibition
road
and
and
the
roads
north
and
south
the
design
was
placed
before
the
prince
at
one
of
the
meetings
at
the
earl
de
and
it
was
exhibited
at
the
royal
academy
in
the
same
year
the
house
of
commons
however
after
granting
such
a
large
sum
of
money
for
the
purchase
of
the
land
expressed
its
disapproval
of
removing
the
national
gallery
from
the
present
position
said
to
be
the
finest
site
in
europe
and
the
fellows
of
the
royal
academy
were
informed
that
the
portion
of
the
building
they
then
occupied
would
be
added
to
that
of
the
gallery
a
view
of
the
gates
and
lodge
as
at
present
executed
is
here
given
illustration
it
can
not
be
supposed
that
a
sum
of
would
have
been
expended
by
the
nation
for
the
purpose
of
giving
the
horticultural
society
a
perpetual
lease
of
the
best
portion
of
the
estate
purchased
it
is
already
evident
that
the
gardens
are
not
well
situated
there
the
smoke
of
the
district
will
not
permit
the
growth
of
delicate
plants
and
their
exhibitions
are
supplied
from
the
gardens
at
chiswick
in
much
less
than
fifty
years
their
grounds
will
probably
be
the
centre
of
london
and
consequently
the
noble
conception
of
his
royal
highness
has
still
a
good
chance
of
being
carried
into
effect
the
society
will
be
smoked
out
when
the
city
bounds
are
extended
the
present
national
gallery
building
will
be
wanted
either
for
a
bank
of
england
or
a
royal
exchange
and
my
lord
mayor
may
follow
the
example
of
the
india
directors
and
leave
the
mansion
house
to
move
to
whitehall
a
tunnel
under
the
exhibition
road
takes
visitors
into
the
grounds
direct
from
the
railway
that
now
makes
them
as
easy
of
access
from
the
heart
of
the
city
as
charing
cross
itself
a
few
remarks
may
be
made
here
on
the
great
rise
which
takes
place
in
the
value
of
land
in
any
fashionable
neighbourhood
of
london
required
for
the
erection
of
buildings
the
harrington
estate
at
kensington
gore
containing
in
the
whole
was
the
joint
property
of
the
earl
of
harrington
and
of
the
baron
de
villars
through
the
right
of
his
wife
the
baroness
de
graffenried
villars
previous
to
it
had
been
some
time
in
chancery
in
that
year
john
gaunt
lye
was
appointed
auditor
and
agent
to
the
fifth
earl
of
harrington
for
the
whole
of
the
property
the
rental
of
the
kensington
gore
estate
amounted
at
this
time
to
per
annum
through
exertions
he
having
received
a
power
of
attorney
for
the
purpose
the
estate
was
taken
out
of
chancery
and
a
division
took
place
on
the
may
at
office
in
lancaster
place
for
the
purpose
of
division
one
portion
that
charged
with
maintaining
the
cromwell
almshouses
was
valued
at
and
the
other
at
cards
representing
each
portion
were
placed
in
a
hat
and
the
one
representing
the
was
taken
out
by
the
baron
in
the
portion
was
let
to
jackson
on
a
building
agreement
for
years
at
per
acre
or
per
annum
in
the
baron
de
villars
sold
his
moiety
to
the
royal
commissioners
for
the
exhibition
of
for
the
sum
of
the
commissioners
only
wanted
a
small
portion
of
the
property
the
first
offer
made
by
cubitt
to
the
surveyor
of
the
estate
was
for
acres
or
at
the
rate
of
per
acre
this
was
declined
and
after
a
little
negotiation
the
sum
of
was
obtained
the
matter
was
settled
on
the
of
march
jackson
the
builder
received
as
compensation
for
the
loss
of
so
much
of
his
building
land
more
land
was
purchased
by
the
royal
commissioners
to
make
up
the
site
they
required
in
the
very
middle
of
the
latter
was
a
field
which
had
only
been
used
as
a
place
for
beating
carpets
it
belonged
to
the
smith
charity
estate
and
fetched
a
rent
of
about
per
annum
this
field
was
obtained
by
giving
in
exchange
an
outlaying
one
on
the
villars
estate
the
building
value
of
which
was
estimated
at
per
annum
the
royal
commissioners
after
squaring
the
site
they
required
and
putting
aside
the
portion
now
occupied
by
the
department
of
science
and
art
parcelled
out
the
remaining
outlying
portion
into
three
blocks
and
let
them
on
building
leases
the
first
and
most
important
of
these
was
secured
by
the
author
for
an
employer
at
a
rental
of
per
annum
on
condition
that
the
fee
of
each
house
plot
could
be
purchased
within
years
after
the
lease
was
granted
it
contained
about
acres
and
these
are
now
the
only
freeholds
that
can
be
obtained
this
plot
is
now
covered
with
buildings
of
the
selling
value
as
leaseholds
of
and
it
produces
an
improved
ground
rental
for
the
purchase
of
the
whole
fee
the
sum
to
be
paid
was
so
that
for
a
portion
of
this
land
which
the
author
of
this
work
as
surveyor
of
the
property
sold
in
for
little
more
than
per
acre
the
value
had
risen
in
to
no
less
than
per
acre
it
is
only
since
hyde
park
has
become
almost
the
centre
of
the
metropolis
instead
of
being
in
one
of
its
rural
districts
that
attention
has
been
paid
to
supply
it
with
ornamental
lodges
and
gates
the
country
was
so
long
occupied
with
the
importance
of
the
war
with
france
which
terminated
so
gloriously
to
the
honour
of
our
country
that
the
royal
parks
were
left
in
a
very
neglected
state
and
the
gates
and
lodges
particularly
the
entrance
into
london
by
knightsbridge
were
mean
in
character
and
totally
unworthy
of
the
purpose
londoners
of
the
present
day
have
no
notion
of
the
wretched
state
of
hyde
park
as
it
existed
fifty
years
ago
the
side
next
park
lane
now
a
beautiful
walk
adorned
by
the
utmost
skill
with
several
varieties
of
flowers
and
shrubs
was
then
a
narrow
sunken
road
which
for
the
most
part
continued
by
the
side
of
the
boundary

all
the
way
from
oxford

commenced
was
filled
up

and
enclosed
by
handsome
iron
posts

some
extensive
gravel

existed
in
the
middle
of
the
park
these
were
filled
up
one
only
being
permitted
to
remain
the
surface
of
the
park
was
generally
levelled
and
manured
by
which
the
herbage
has
been
greatly
improved
numerous
seats
were
placed
about
the
park
for
the
convenience
of
the
public
clumps
and
avenues
of
trees
were
planted
the
serpentine
was
cleansed
for
the
first
time
it
is
just
now
recleansed
a
new
drive
nearly
a
mile
in
extent
was
made
through
the
most
distant
and
beautiful
part
of
the
park
to
lead
to
kensington
gardens
and
generally
all
the
roads
were
macadamized
and
enclosed
with
posts
and
rails
to
connect
the
roads
north
and
south
of
the
serpentine
a
handsome
bridge
was
erected
from
the
designs
and
under
the
superintendence
of
rennie
this
has
much
conduced
to
the
accommodation
of
pedestrians
and
horsemen
about
twenty
years
after
these
great
improvements
were
effected
queen
garden
at
the
extreme
termination
of
kensington
gardens
was
thrown
open
to
the
public
the
kitchen
garden
belonging
to
kensington
palace
was
let
out
on
building

of
kensington
with

this
road
called
the

the
improvements
continued
and
are
being
still
carried
on
the
lodges
and
gates
at
the
chief
entrances
into
the
park
were
put
up
at
the
expense
of
the
nation
when
any
building
operator
required
an
entrance
into
the
park
for
some
new
outlying
district

bore

great
stanhope
street
sir
the
works
at

hyde
park
are
very
well
executed
and
the
entrance
as
completed
produces
a
good
effect
but
that
effect
would
be
materially
improved
if
the
gates
and
the

the
ornamental
works
were
relieved
by
colour
and
some
of
the
parts
gilt
as
i
intended
they
should
be
the
two
pedestals
are
also
without
the
groups
which
were
to
form
the
superstructure
of
the
square
blocks
the
work
so
far
as
it
is
executed
is
very
well
executed
and
i
am
quite
satisfied
with
it
so
far
but
i
shall
not
consider
it
completed
until
the
groups
are
placed
on
the
pedestals
and
the
best
effect
will
not
be
produced

there
is
another
very

affected
by

presence
in

about
twenty
years
ago
it
was
the
universal
practice
in
good
buildings
to
place
wide
stone
landings
three
times
the
thickness
of

the
only
objection

there
were
several
varieties
of

they
were

are
preserved
in
the
soane
museum
one
sort
was
inches
in

by
inches
at
the
top
and
by
inches
at
the
bottom
they
were
curved
inwards
with
a
small
opening
by
inch
in
the
centre
the
edges
of
the
brick
were
slightly
splayed
and
the
sides
scored
these
were
as
strong
as
the
common
bricks
and
very
much
lighter
when
the
east
india
house
was
pulled
down
a
large
quantity
of
these
bricks
was
obtained
they
were
brought
to
kensington
and
the
builders
did
not
know
what
they
were
intended
for
their
purpose
being
pointed
out
they
were
used
up
in
the
construction
of
flooring
a
method
of
rendering
buildings
nearly
was
introduced
about
by
david
hartley
for
hull
it
consisted
in
placing
thin
metal
plates
between
the
flooring
boards
and
the
joists
so
as
to
prevent
any
upward
currents
of
air
for
domestic
buildings
the
system
was
one
of
great
value
after
several
successful
trials
it
obtained
considerable
notoriety
and
being
thought
capable
of
an
impossibility
that
of
rendering
a
theatre
fireproof
it
was
applied
to
the
pantheon
theatre
in
oxford
street
on
that
structure
being
burnt
to
the
ground
the
plates
lost
their
character
and
went
out
of
use
it
was
clearly
a
mistake
to
apply
them
to
such
a
building
thin
iron
plates
hung
at
a
short
distance
below
the
ceiling
were
successfully
adopted
by
walter
crum
to
prevent
the
spread
of
fire
from
one
room

a
rectory
not

from

where
the
author
was
engaged
a

was
in
such
an

that

the
rector
had
tried
several
preventives
himself
one
was
a
mixture
used
to
cloth
a
wash
of
soap
and
alum
the
ingredients
were
mixed
in
the
following
proportions
lb
of
mottled
soap
to
gallon
of
water
this
mixture
when
in
a
boiling
state
was
laid
over
the
surface
of
the
brickwork
steadily
and
carefully
with
a
large
flat
brush
so
as
not
to
form
a
froth
or
lather
on
the
surface
and
was
permitted
to
remain
hours
to
become
dry
and
hard
another
mixture
was
then
made
in
these
proportions
lb
of
alum
to
gallons
of
water
which
after
standing
twelve
hours
in
order
that
the
alum
should
be
completely
dissolved
was
applied
in
like
manner
with
a
flat
brush
over
the
coating
of
soap
the
coating
had
to
be
very
often
renewed
the
wall
most
exposed
was
made
free
from
wet
by
being
covered
with
a
coating
of
cement
walls
exposed
to

be
coated
with
a
thin
layer
of
portland
cement
mixed
with
a
little
plaster
of
paris
and
after
this
is
thoroughly
dry
it
may
be
hardened
and
rendered
impervious
to
water
by
painting
it
with
boiled
linseed
oil
and
red
lead
mixed
together
in
very
exposed
situations
all
external
walls
should
be
battened
lath
and
plastered
within
or
built
with
a
hollow
cavity
in
the
middle
with
proper
bond
and
a
proportionate
increase
of
thickness
the
hollow
could
be
filled
with
concrete
or
the
back
of
the
bricks
covered
with
pitch
there
are
several
other
methods
for
keeping
walls
free
from
damp
one
is
to
saturate
the
walls
with
some
kind
of
mastic
or
a
wash
composed
of
two
or
three
parts
of
resin
and
one
part
of
drying
oil
to
the
extent
of
as
many
washes
as
the
wall
will
absorb
this
must
be
quite
dry
at
the
time
or
be
dried
by
means
of
a
small
portable
furnace
the
plan
is
effectual
but
it
is
a
difficult
operation
to
perform
a
cement
composed
of
lime
boiled
linseed
oil
white
lead
and
sand
has
been
recommended
besides
these
various
compositions
there
are
several
excellent
paint
and
metallic
cements
which
have
stood
very
severe
tests
and
are
largely
made

of

in

are
about
a
dozen
varieties
of

which
were
placed
in

various

as
to
vary

could
have

these

however
could
not
be
spared
so
it
was
proposed
to
turn
the
two
octagon
rooms
into
what
may
be
termed
rooms
and
to
attempt
growing
dwarf
in
them
as
practised
in

the
roofs
of
these

were
to
be
constructed

remarked
that
the

wooden
houses
were
once
the
chief
kind
of
construction
in
england
the
great
fire
of
london
would
not
have
been
so
serious
in
its
results
if
such
constructions
had
not
been
almost
universal
in
many
parts
of
england
these
houses
have
other
designations
there
is
a
mode
of
building
peculiar
to
each
and
adapted
to
the
kind
of
material
that
the
districts
offer
in
cambridgeshire
for
instance
many
of
the
houses
are
formed
entirely
of
a
kind
of
indurated
chalk
marl
of
which
there
are
extensive
quarries
at
roach
near
burwell
others
are
of
gault
a
local
term
for
the
blue
clay
which
lies
below
the
gravel
of
cambridgeshire
and
forms
the
immediate
substratum
in
the
low
ground
about
it
this

beaten
up
with
chopped
straw
then
formed
into
blocks
of
large
size
and
dried
by
the
sun
a
writer
in
the
portfolio
in
his
remarks
on
what
he
terms
the
inferior
style
of
domestic
architecture
says
of
these
houses
have
the
lower
floor
formed
of
stone
or
clunch
in
which
a
framework
of
wood
is
raised
consisting
of
studs
and
with
strong
posts
at
intervals
and
some
cross
pieces
as
a
tie
the
joists
of
the
upper
floor
are
laid
in
the
and
project
about
a
foot
or
eighteen
inches
beyond
the
wall
beneath
the
smaller
timbers
have
tenons
which
are
fitted
into
mortices
in
the
larger
and
secured
by
wooden
pins
the
interstices
are
filled
either
with
durable
boarding
double
lath
and
plaster
clunch
or
bricks
laid
level
or
obliquely
the
better
houses
of
this
description
have
gables
with
ornamented
with
and
corbels
or
brackets
more
or
less
carved
under
the
ends
of
the
principal
timbers
of
the
upper
the
is
sometimes
called
it
was
a
board
fixed
to
the
ends
of
the
gables
of
timber
houses
to
hide
those
of
the
projecting
timbers
of
the
roof
and
throw
off
the
wet
they
were
generally
richly
carved
and
very
ornamental
occasionally
some
of
these
of
the
date
of
the
century
are
met
with
those
of
the
and
many
of
the
elizabethan
character
are
very
common
we
have
few
of
the
better
class
of
these
houses
in
which
the
decorative
labour
of
our
ancestors
was
most
conspicuous
remaining
in
our
towns
and
cities
but
in
edinburgh
york
chester
and
newcastle
there
are
still
a
sufficient
number
of
specimens
to
prove
the
truth
of
these
remarks
in
the
towns
of
normandy
and
the
netherlands
numerous
buildings
and
indeed
whole
streets
may
be
seen
which
still
exhibit
the
perfect
counterpart
of
our
old
cheapside
as
it
appeared
before
the
great
fire
troyes
the
capital
of
champagne
still
retains
its
ancient
buildings
and
the
houses
of
caen
which
were
raised
or
restored
during
the
period
in
the
century
when
it
was
in
the
hands
of
the
english
show
us
what
our
cities
once
were
and
of
course
the
extent
of
our
improvements
london
formerly
possessed
the
richest
examples
at
the
corner
of
chancery
lane
in
fleet
street
there
once
stood
a
house
in
timber
each
story
projecting
the
whole
of
the
timber
and
the
gables
being
richly
carved
in
this
house
once
lived
the
celebrated
isaac
walton
the
other
most
common
application
of
this
kind
of
house
is
in
some
counties
the
woodwork
is
not
in
patterns
it
appears
that
when
a
greater
degree
of
elegance
was
required
the
uprights
and
beams
were
carved
or
the
houses
were
pargetted
that
is
coated
thickly
with
plaster
in
which
embossed
or
indented
ornaments
were
used
this
kind
is
very
common
in
nearly
all
the
english
counties
the
origin
of
the
word
appears
to
be
doubtful
we
find
substantive
and
and
verb
in
old
writings
of
various
kinds
of
plaster
work
used
inside
and
outside
of
houses
particularly
about
the
time
of
elizabeth
the
word
was
used
as
far
back
as
the
houses
generally
had
the
woodwork
studs
and
posts
painted
black
or
tarred
with
the
intermediate
spaces
of
brickwork
whitewashed
many
of
these
houses
have
been
plastered
over
in
modern
days
in
london
several
of
them
have
been
refronted
and
we
lose
sight
of
the
woodwork
and
imagine
we
see
houses
in
some
parts
of
the
country
we
see
numbers
of
cottages
built
of
mud
mixed
with
chopped

commonly

of

derivation

the
haum
is
used
to
give

these
houses
previously
described
in
connexion
with
concrete
erections
were
built
about
a
yard
in
height
at
a
time
each
part
was
allowed
to
dry
before
further
addition
was
made
the
openings
for
windows
and
doors
were
cut
when
the
wall
became
firmer
the
walls
were
then
smoothed
off
a
little
and
whitewashed
these
houses
are
said
to
be
very
strong
and
to
last
for
many
years
in
the
midland
counties
they
seldom
exceed
one
story
in
height

in
devon
somersetshire
and

is
a
common
material
for

with

called

but
very
few
of
them
are
worked
in

in
northamptonshire
the
houses
are
commonly
called

because
the

is

the

the

from
the
same
derivation
as
what
in
one
county
is

dab
is
in
another
and
is
here
used
as
a
substantive
but
it
is
properly
a
verb
to

to

bespatter

to

intermingled

the

ceilings
inside
the

are
of
excessively
rich
character
in

of

are

rendering
a
remark
of
lord
true
that
in
such
houses
you
did
not
know
where
to
become
to
get
out
of
the
sun
or
the
cold
they
are
now
sometimes
called
houses
from
the
effect
at
a
distance
some
of
these
old
mansions
had
the
hall
extending
to
the
roof
and
this
was
carried
down
to
a
very
late
period
at
kirby
in
northamptonshire
a
seat
of
the
lord
chancellor
hatton
built
by
the
architect
john
thorpe
inigo
jones
altered
the
timbers
of
the
hall
roof
and
gave
them
an
italianized
character
he
was
previous
to
his
visit
to
italy
one
of
the
chief
and
most
celebrated
masters
of
the
then
fashionable
elizabethan
style
which
was
carried
down
to
a
later
period
than
is
generally
supposed
the
superior
class
of
wooden
houses
were
for
the
gentry
the
wattle
and
dab
houses
for
the
hind
this
cottage
then
must
have
been
little
better
than
a
miserable
shed
cottages
still
exist
in
the
north
of
england
amid
the
northern
counties
that
are
bad
at
the
very
best
the
tenants
have
to
bring
everything
with
them
partitions
fixtures
of
all
kinds
grates
and
a
substitute
for
a
ceiling
certainly
the
improved
concrete
cottage
if
it
could
be
erected
at
a
small
expense
would
be
a
great
advantage
to
them
its
partitions
and
even
its
roof
the
latter
covered
with
slate
might
be
securely
formed
of
strong
hurdles
and
a
cistern
for
water
easily
placed
just
below
it
the
walls
if
covered
with
a
good
portland
cement
face
will
last
for
many
years
and
if
the
roof
be
so
formed
as
to
protect
them
for
warmth
comfort
and
cleanliness
such
cottages
are
unsurpassed
it
is
to
be
regretted
that
the
combination
of
workmen
forming
the
various
unions
has
so
raised
the
price
of
labour
that
it
has
reacted
against
themselves
and
the
houses
roomy
and
formed
of
sound
lasting
materials
can
no
longer
be
constructed
at
a
cost
that
would
allow
a
fair
percentage
on
outlay
lord
bacon
paid
particular
attention
to
building
and
he
had
several
fine
mansions
he
received
his
sovereign
at
one
who
on
her
remarking
its
great
size
said
was
not
that
the
house
was
too
big
but
that
her
grace
had
made
him
too
big
to
inhabit
his
essay
on
building
gives
such
a
complete
picture
of
what
the
house
was
in
those
days
that
it
is
here
quoted
therefore
i
say
you
can
not
have
a
perfect
palace
except
you
have
two
several
sides
a
side
for
the
banquet
as
is
spoken
of
in
the
book
of
esther
and
a
side
for
the
household
the
one
for
feasts
and
triumphs
and
the
other
for
dwelling
understand
both
these
sides
to
be
not
only
returns
but
parts
of
the
front
and
to
be
uniform
without
though
severally
partitioned
within
and
to
be
on
both
sides
of
a
great
and
stately
tower
in
the
midst
of
the
front
that
as
it
were
joineth
them
together
on
either
hand
i
would
have
on
the
side
of
the
banquet
in
front
one
only
goodly
room
above
stairs
of
some
forty
feet
high
and
under
it
a
room
for
a
dressing
or
preparing
place
at
times
of
triumphs
on
the
other
side
which
is
the
household
side
i
wish
it
divided
at
the
first
into
a
hall
and
chapel
with
a
partition
between
both
of
good
state
and
bigness
and
those
not
to
go
all
the
length
but
to
have
at
the
farther
end
a
winter
and
summer
parlour
both
fair
and
under
these
rooms
a
fair
and
large
cellar
sunk
under
ground
and
likewise
some
privy
kitchens
with
butteries
and
pantries
and
the
like
as
for
the
tower
i
would
have
it
two
stories
of
eighteen
foot
high
apiece
above
the
two
wings
and
goodly
leads
upon
the
top
railed
with
statues
interposed
and
the
same
tower
to
be
divided
into
rooms
as
shall
be
thought
fit
the
stairs
likewise
to
the
upper
rooms
let
them
be
upon
a
fair
open
newel
and
finely
railed
in
with
images
of
wood
cast
into
a
brass
colour
and
a
very
fair
at
the
top
but
this
to
be
if
you
do
not
point
any
of
the
lower
rooms
for
a
of
servants
for
otherwise
you
shall
have
the
dinner
after
your
own
for
the
steam
of
it
will
come
up
as
in
a
tunnel
and
so
much
for
the

only
i
understand
the
height
of
the
first
stairs
to
be
sixteen
foot
which
is
the
height
of
the
lower
room
the
front
is
there
to
be
a
fair
court
but
three
sides
of
it
of
a
far
lower
building
than
the

and
in
all
the
four
corners
of

fair
staircases
cast
into

on

not
within

those

are
not
to
be
of
the
height
of
the

but
rather
proportionable
to
the
lower
buildings
let
the
court
not
be
paved
for
that
striketh
up
a
great
heat
in
summer
and
much
cold
in
winter
but
only
some
side
alleys
with
a
cross
and
the
quarters
to

being
kept
shorn
but
not
too
near

let
it
be

in

galleries
let
there
be
three

five
fine

fine
coloured

in

you
may
have

both
for

cast
it
also
that
you
may
have

both
for
summer

you
shall
have
sometimes
fair

can
not
tell

be
out

i
hold
them
of
good
use
in
cities
indeed
upright
do
better
in
respect
of
the
uniformity
towards
the
street
for
they
be
pretty
retiring
places
for
conference
and
besides
they
keep
both
the
wind
and
sun
off
for
that
which
would
strike
almost

doth
scarce

four

on

there

be
turned

be
level

no

let
there
be
a

some
fair
work
of

in
the

of
this

to
be
paved
as
the
other
court
was
these
buildings
to
be
for
privy
lodgings
on

the

upon

likewise
an

freshness
of
the

both
corners
of
the
farther

by

let
there
be
two
delicate

rich
cabinets
daintily
paved
richly
hanged
glazed
with
crystalline
glass
and
a
rich
cupola
in
the
midst

all
other
elegancy
that
may
be

upon

thus

three

both

one
of
our
most
eminent
writers
on

repton
remarked
that
and
architecture
like
all
the
fine
arts
have
much
in
common
and
the
department
of
architecture
which
belongs
more
exclusively
to
gardens
has
especially
a
great
affinity
to
gardening
in
its
broadest
in
fact
there
is
much
more
relation
between
the
two
than
is
usually
admitted
a
matter
already
alluded
to
in
the
introductory
essay
architectural
forms

decorations
temples
and
rustic
bowers
seats
are
not
as
many
have
observed
unfit
for
our
climate
in
western
counties
they
certainly
can
be
indulged
in
to
a
large
extent
and
the
fine
evergreens
and
the
beautiful
grass
of
this
country
will
in
association
with
ornamental
terraces
and
sculpture
impart
sufficient
warmth
of
tone
to
render
them
agreeable
the
garden
of
at
elvaston
in
derbyshire
and
the
alhambra
gardens
there
those
at
castle
coombe
trentham
alton
towers
and
bowood
sufficiently
prove
how
attractive
gardens
can
be
architecturally
made
in
former
years
gardens
were
almost
universal
through
every
part
of
england
as
is
proved
by
the
view
engraved
by
kipp
from
drawings
by
knyff
in
the
book
illustrata
and
those
of
the
gardens
given
in
restituta
and
the
similar
work
on
cambridge
but
gardens
like
all
other
mundane
matters
have
their
periods
of
change
or
retrogression
the
natural
style
having
almost
obliterated
the

their
arrangement
is
varied

agreeable
being
picturesque
without
disorder
symmetrical
without
monotony
and
we
here
observe
the
art
with
which
the
arrangement
of
a

is
made
to
agree
with
the
rural
nature
of
which
it
forms

the

doubtless

work
of
the

illustration
during
the
year
the
author
in
conjunction
with
the
late
john
britton
was
engaged
in
making
some
topographical
sketches
in
one
of
the
western
counties
of
england
he
became
for
a
short
time
the
guest
of
one
of
its
principal
residents
a
gentleman
who
had
succeeded
to
the
possession
of
more
than
a
million
of
money
the
result
of
a
gains
as
a
merchant
in

city
he
had
filled
the
small
house
he
was
then
inhabiting
with
a
very
fine
collection
of
antique
bronzes
also
with
ancient
and
modern
statuary
the
house
was
occupied
in
every
corner
with
these
valuable
and
beautiful
works
of
art
he
was
then
having
another
house
of
larger
dimensions
erected
to
receive
them
considerable
discussion
took
place
at
his
table
between
himself
and
his
visitors
among
whom
were
two
or
three
distinguished
men
of
taste
as
to
the
best
method
of
introducing
sculpture
into
a
dwelling
of
moderate
capacity
it
was
the
general
opinion
that
to
properly
exhibit
classic
sculpture
a
villa
the
size
of
those
of
the
ancients
such
as
are
described
by
pliny
in
the
account
of
his

would
be
required

that
no
other
would
suffice

his
return

as
a
matter
of
amusement
without
any
thought
that
his
ideas
would
ever
be
carried

made

the

calculated
to
yield
as
much
enjoyment

one
certainly
that
would
be

highly
appreciated

large
roofs
can
be
constructed
on
this
principle
at
a
very
cheap
rate
and
it
is
a
very
strong
and
efficient
one
the
roof
of
the

in
constructed
by
sydney
smirke
is
of
a
similar
kind
the
roofs
of
the

fowkes
were
on
the

principle

as
these
were

stand

were
very
slight
the
cross
section

the
ventilating
flue
proposed

illustrated
in
a

chapter
the
small
stack
in
the
low
building
shows
the
incline
necessary
to
meet
the
back
eddy
of
wind
from

it
would
have
been
better
could
it
have
been
effected
to
have
placed
the
stack
in
a
position
parallel
to
the
high
building
and
not
at
right
angles
to
it
the
stack
on
the
latter
shows
two
ventilating
flues
each
with
an
upward
shaft
the
whole
of
the
smoke
from
the
fireplaces
would
be
delivered
from
these
two
shafts
it
only
remains
to
illustrate
the
system
of
warming
proposed
to
have
been
introduced
this
was
by
a
combination
of
two
entirely
different
systems
of
warm
water
circulation
through
iron
pipes
the
various
apparatus
of
warming
buildings
by
the
circulation
of
hot
water
may
be
roughly
stated
to
be
of
two
kinds
each
acting
on
the
opposite
principle
to
the
other
the
first
or
more
modern
one
is
the
this
has
always
been
preferred
by
the
author
it
being
more
conveniently
introduced
into
a
building
less
expensive
and
giving
less
trouble
than
any
other
and
more
certain
in
its
action
in
it
the
water
circulates
with
great
rapidity
completely
under
pressure
the
pipes
being
closed
and
the
whole
of
the
air
expelled
from
them
the
older
system
is
that
in
which
the
tubes
are
not
closed
but
are
connected
with
a
cistern
into
which
the
water
is
allowed
to
flow
and
the
two
may
very
properly
be
called
the
high
and
low
temperature
systems
and
by
these
terms
they
are
here
designated
with
the
first
the
tubes
can
be
made
to
reach
a
higher
degree
of
heat
if
necessary
by
placing
a
larger
proportion
of
them
than
is
usual
in
the
furnace
but
with
the
second
a
temperature
of
degrees
can
alone
be
reached
with
the
latter
its
greater
or
less
efficiency
depends
upon
the
position
of
its
open
cistern
which
regulates
the
amount
of
pressure
in
the
tubes
according
as
its
situation
is
high
or
low
it
was
introduced
into
this
country
about
the
open
cistern
was
placed
in
the
upper
part
of
the
house
the
boiler
being
below
in
the
kitchen
thus
allowing
a
considerable
pressure
in
the
tubes
and
securing
a
quick
circulation
of
the
water
the
high
temperature
system
was
introduced
by
perkins
about
the
year
in
its
simplest
form
it
consisted
of
a
continuous
or
endless
tube
of
wrought
iron
of
one
inch
external
diameter
filled
with
water
and
closed
in
all
parts
a
portion
of
the
tubing
was
formed
into
a
coil
and
placed
in
a
furnace
of
wrought
iron
the
fire
being
enclosed
in
when
it
was
first
introduced
a
larger
amount
of
tubing
was
placed
in
the
furnace
than
is
now
usually
done
with
the
proper
amount
or
only
of
the
full
quantity
is
necessary
and
then
it
must
be
obvious
that
no
overheating
of
the
tubes
can
take
place
in
practice
it
is
more
usual
to
find
objections
made
to
the
apparatus
not
giving
sufficient
heat
than
to
its
giving
too
much
the
quantity
of
feet
in
pipes
necessary
to
raise
rooms
of
a
certain
size
to
a
given
temperature
must
be
proportioned
to
their
cubical
contents
and
this
depends
equally
on
the
situation
and
aspect
of
the
building
the
number
of
doors
and
windows
or
skylights
no
rule
can
consequently
be
given
which
would
be
applicable
to
all
places
with
any
degree
of
certainty
the
pipes
being
only
of
an
inch
internal
diameter
a
very
small
quantity
of
water
is
required
to
fill
the
apparatus
a
tube
called
the
expansion
tube
is
placed
above
the
highest
level
of
the
circulating
pipes
and
is
generally
of
larger
diameter
the
object
of
this
tube
is
to
allow
for
the
expansion
of
the
water
as
it
becomes
heated
a
tube
is
also
placed
at
the
highest
level
in
order
to
fill
the
apparatus
so
as
to
leave
the
expansion
tube
empty
the
tubes
are
provided
with
screw
plugs
so
as
to
be
conveniently
opened
when
it
is
required
to
fill
the
pipes
with
water
and
closed
again
after
being
filled
this
can
be
done
with
facility
by
a
servant
the
circulation
of
the
water
is
produced
by
the
application
of
heat
to
the
coil
in
the
furnace
and
as
the
small
size
of
the
pipes
admits
of
presenting
the
largest
possible
amount
of
surface
to
the
action
of
the
fire
it
is
clear
that
a
greater
economy
of
fuel
is
effected
by
it
than
by
the
ordinary
system
of
boilers
as
the
water
becomes
heated
it
rises
immediately
to
the
highest
level
of
the
circulating
pipes
and
thus
forms
a
column
of
heated
water
specifically
lighter
than
the
colder
water
which
descends
to
the
lower
part
of
the
coil
thus
a
circulation
is
effected
throughout
the
whole
course
of
the
pipes
d
which
eventually
become
heated
and
the
whole
may
be
regulated
exactly
to
that
degree
of
temperature
which
is
most
conducive
to
a
beneficial
effect
to
regulate
the
degree
of
heat
to
be
given
to
the
tubes
without
requiring
the
necessity
of
an
attendant
advantage
has
been
taken
of
the
expansive
property
of
the
iron
pipe
when
heated
there
are
three
multiplying
levers
fixed
in
a
box
and
so
placed
that
the
short
arm
of
one
of
the
levers
rests
upon
a
regulating
screw
attached
to
the
flow
pipe
on
the
other
end
of
the
series
of
levers
a
rod
so
rests
that
upon
the
slightest
movement
of
the
levers
the
damper
in
the
flue
which
is
attached
to
the
rod
is
opened
or
closed
as
the
case
may
be
the
box
of
levers
is
suspended
from
the
hot
pipe
so
as
to
leave
about
two
feet
in
length
between
the
point
of
suspension
and
the
point
of
contact
with
the
short
arm
of
the
lever
the
operation
of
this
arrangement
is
obvious
for
the
instant
the
pipe
becomes
heated
it
expands
and
presses
the
short
arm
of
the
lever
and
as
the
fulcrum
within
the
box
can
not
move
by
reason
of
the
rod
which
suspends
it
being
cold
it
follows
that
the
lever
must
be
depressed
by
which
action
a
sufficient
motion
is
given
to
the
damper
to
close
it
at
any
given
temperature
at
which
it
may
be
originally
fixed
the
great
advantage
in
the
use
of
this
apparatus
is
the
saving
of
time
in
obtaining
the
requisite
degree
of
heat
it
often
happens
that
the
time
occupied
in
heating
the
water
of
an
ordinary
apparatus
completely
defeats
the
object
of
getting
warmth
in
any
reasonable
time
particularly
in
greenhouses
where
it
is
frequently
desirable
to
get
up
the
heat
quickly
to
prevent
the
effect
of
frost
it
has
been
said
that
this
property
of
generating
the
heat
rapidly
has
the
disadvantage
of
not
being
able
to
retain
it
this
however
is
not
the
case
for
on
the
contrary
an
equal
temperature
may
be
maintained
for
any
length
of
time
that
may
be
desired
it
is
only
necessary
to
make
the
fireplace
sufficiently
large
to
contain
fuel
enough
to
last
the
time
the
heat
is
required
to
be
continued
and
the
damper
will
regulate
the
combustion
of
the
fuel
and
the
heat
of
the
pipes
so
that
there
will
be
no
variation
for
twelve
hours
together
there
being
no
boiler
to
the
apparatus
it
is
free
from
the
ordinary
danger
of
explosion
if
a
pipe
by
possibility
should
burst
no
harm
ensues
for
the
water
escapes
from
so
small
an
aperture
that
it
becomes
absolutely
cool
by
its
expansion
and
mixture
with
atmospheric
air
so
little
fear
of
fire
exists
with
the
apparatus
that
the
directors
of
the
principal
fire
offices
readily
accept
at
the
lowest
rate
of
premium
all
proposals
for
the
insurance
of
buildings
in
which
the
system
is
adopted
not
requiring
even
the
customary
inspection
the
author
made
drawings
of
one
of
these
apparatus
put
up
in
an
ornamental
greenhouse
in
kew
gardens
in
and
fourteen
years
after
the
director
of
the
garden
sir
hooker
publicly
allowed
it
to
be
stated
in
print
that
no
apparatus
in
any
of
their
houses
had
given
so
much
satisfaction
that
the
heat
was
given
out
after
lighting
the
fires
more
rapidly
than
in
any
other
of
their
houses
and
steadily
maintained
at
any
degree
of
temperature
required
the
two
systems
of
the
high
and
low
temperature
can
readily
be
combined
and
the
temperature
of
both
large
and
small
tubes
nearly
equalized
this
may
be
done
by
using
one
furnace
a
diagram
given
by
arnott
in
a
lecture
delivered
by
him
at
the
royal
institution
in
march
with
his
explanation
will
show
the
principle
upon
which
the
combination
is
effected
suppose
a
fig
is
a
cistern
full
of
cold
water
and
b
a
cistern
full
of
hot
water
if
the
two
cocks
are
unturned
it
is
a
fact
that
the
water
at
will
be
one
degree
of
warmth
only
above
the
water
at
illustration
fig
a
and
the
water
at
e
will
be
of
one
degree
less
temperature
than
the
water
in
b
if
therefore
on
this
principle
some
of
the
pipes
of
the
system
are
passed
through
the
large
tubing
of
the
low
temperature
one
the
desired
effect
is
obtained
the
large
pipes
or
tablets
of
one
apparatus
remain
at
their
full
heat
while
an
additional
quantity
of
inch
pipe
of
sufficiently
warm
temperature
is
obtained
that
can
be
carried
into
rooms
and
placed
in
situations
into
which
the
warming
surfaces
of
the
system
could
not
be
made
to
approach
as
regards
the
low
temperature
apparatus
if
the
large
pipes
belonging
to
it
are
laid
in
sufficient
quantity
they
doubtless
have
the
effect
of
producing
a
moderate
degree
of
heat
the
best
way
of
introducing
them
into
a

to
sink
them
in
channels

the
floor
with
perforated
ironwork
over
them

are
more
usually
introduced
into
hothouses

workshops

their
appearance
is
not
objectionable
a
feeling
exists
in
favour
of
their
use
in
conservatories

to
show
how
they
can
be
retained

principle

applied
by
him
for

its
mode
of
application
is
explained
in
the
following
extract
from
his
report
on
and
ventilating

where
the
mechanical
mode
of
ventilation
already
described
by
means
of
fanners
and
now
common
in
factories
has
been
adopted
an
addition
might
be
made
to
the
apparatus
for
extracting
the
impure
air
which
would
drive
fresh
air
in
and
which
by
causing
the
two
currents
to
pass
each
other
in
contact
for
a
certain
distance
in
very
thin
metallic
tubes
would
cause
the
fresh
air
entering
to
absorb
nearly
the
whole
heat
from
the
impure
air
going
out
and
would
thus
render
it
at
once
both
pure
and
warm
and
would
consequently
save
after
the
room
was
once
warmed
any
further
expense
of
fuel
for
the
day
and
would
avoid
how
rapid
soever
the
ventilation
all
the
danger
from
draught
and
unequal
the
above
idea
is
extremely
ingenious
but
as
to
its
practical
efficiency
some
doubt
might
be
expressed
the
temperature
of
a
warm
room
even
if
it
was
would
be
much
too
low
to
produce

very
ingenious

the
system

been
introduced
into

babbage
he
placed
the
furnace
in
the
basement
and
divided
the
whole
length
of
piping
by
means
of
a
multiple
cock
into
four
circulations
any
one
of
which
he
could
turn
off

on
at
pleasure

for
the
use

the

saved
labour
in
cleaning
and
lighting
of
fires

it
was
economical
the
consumption
of
fuel

months

one
of
the
chief
peculiarities
in
small
suburban

that

near

within
the

thirty
years
is
that
of

back
of
the
building
are
omitted
and
the
earth
is
sloped
up
in
form
of
a
bank
being
adorned
with
flowers
and
shrubs
so
as
to
look
pleasing
from
within
the
apartments
there
is
usually
a
side
room
in
the
basement
with
descending
steps
to
the
entrance
which
serves
as
an
office
to
the
occupier
of
the

his
business
be

this
is
very
convenient
the
chief
room
in
the
basement
is
used
as
a
dining

supper
room
and
indeed
for
all
common
purposes
by
the
family
it
renders
it
unnecessary
to
have
more
than
one
or
at
most
two
rooms
the
the
library
and
the
superior
are
on
the
floor
above
this
suburban
dwelling
very
much
resembles
the
same
class
of
structure
in
america
where
economy
of
space
is
carried
out
more
completely
than
with
us
and
the
residents
are
less
dependent
on
servants
in
the
american
house
the
pantry
is
nearly
always
placed
between
the
kitchen
and

its
chief
approach
is
from
the
latter

the
americans
exhibit
a
compactness
of
arrangement
and
an
attention
to
detail
that
prove
they
are
in
no
way
behind
us
in
a
knowledge
of
what
is
requisite
for
household
comfort
one
peculiarity
in
the
american
building
is
the
verandah
which
is
considered
to
be
indispensable
it
is
large
and
roomy
and
often
placed
on
three
sides
of
the
building
the
climate
warmer
and
drier
than
our
own

such
an
addition

great
luxury
our
atmosphere
in
the
winter
months
has
often
been
pronounced
of
leaden
gravity
and
it
does
not
permit
of
any
erection
that
stops
the
circulation
of
the
air
which
would
render
it
stagnant
another
peculiarity
in
the
houses
of
our
american
cousins
is
that
they
are
often
cased
in
wood
if
the
house
be
only
two
or
three

advantage
is
that

mode

an
especial
love
for

comfort
has
always
been
an
english
characteristic
it
has
formed
a
species
of
national
taste
and
pride
even
among
our
working
classes
the
constant
changes
of
our
climate
are
injurious
to
every
class
the
chief
point
of
attraction
in
the
english
dwellings
during
wet
cold
and
fog
is
centred
in
the
fireplace
this
has
long
been
deemed
the
favoured
spot
where
mirth
exults
and
glows
before
the
blazing
the
fireplace
suits
our
climate
it
is
cheerful
and
attractive
but
it
gives
its
heat
only
by
radiation
we
are
warmed
on
one
side
and
chilled
on
the
other
but
neither
the
warmth
nor
the
chill
is
too
great
to
bear
and
the
occupant
of
the
room
can
move
into
any
temperature
that
suits
him
in
more
northern
climates
the
use
of
the
fireplace
would
not
be
tolerated
there
the
cold
is
so
excessive
that
an
equal
warmth
must
be
diffused
throughout
the
apartments
and
flues
in
hollow
walls
and
closed
stoves
either
in
iron
or
brick
are
in
the
ascendant
as
already
mentioned
in
an
earlier
part
of
this
work
but
such
means
by
which
the
air
is
heated
and
not
merely
warmed
and
there
is
a
great
difference
between
warmed
air
and
heated
would
not
be
tolerated
here
a
puff
of
air
from
a
closed
stove
caused
by
a
back
draught
is
not
pleasant
and
is
very
different
from
the
honest
puff
of
smoke
from
an
english
fireplace
that
gives
as
a
natural
product
of
combustion
carbonic
acid
gas
but
not
one
of
these
stoves
nor
those
that
are
called
stoves
make
a
good
companionable
fire
and
this
is
not
liked
the
common
open
fireplace
has
held
its
own
and
will
continue
to
hold
its
own
against
the
stove
that
can
be
introduced
in
lieu
of
it
but
it
still
remains
to
find
such
a
construction
as
will
remedy
its
serious
defects
these
are
chiefly
such
as
pertain
to
the
flue
it
is
not
to
the
stove
that
these
belong
for
that
thanks
to
our
excellent
makers
is
quite
perfect
in
our
sluggish
winter
atmosphere
the
smoke
leaves
the
open
flue
with
tolerable
certainty
unless
the
flue
is
foul
with
soot
but
when
high
winds
prevail
and
the
atmosphere
is
anything
but
sluggish
it
teaches
us
the
faults
of
the
open
flue
and
volumes
of
smoke
descend
into
our
apartments
there
are
few
occurrences
in
domestic
life
more
vexatious
and
annoying
than
this
the
numerous
unsightly
appendages
in
the
form
of
cowls
turncaps
and
windguards
which
appear
alike
on
our
houses
churches
and
palaces
whilst
they
exhibit
the
ingenuity
of
our
builders
and
workmen
in
remedying
the
trouble
of
smoky
chimneys
demonstrate
also
the
frequency
of
the
misfortune
when
flues
are
carefully
constructed
with
the
best
modern
improvements
and
a
due
supply
of
air
is
admitted
into
the
stove
a
smoky
chimney
is
an
exception
still
the
flue
forms
only
a
simple
open
funnel
for
the
passage
of
the
smoke
and
failures
will
inevitably
often
happen
a
construction
on
a
good
principle
should
render
these
defects
as
trifling
as
possible
in
our
best
houses
those
constructed
within
the
last
twenty
or
thirty
years
two
kinds
of
the
common
brick
flue
are
mostly
in
use
one
is
of
the
kind
having
a
section
of
by
which
was
made
originally
of
that
size
for
the
accommodation
of
the
poor
this
is
now
retained
only
for
the
kitchen
fire
which
makes
a
large
quantity
of
smoke
and
for
the
rest
of
the
fireplaces
the
flue
known
as
flue
is
employed
which
has
a
diameter
each
way
of
in
the
author
prefers
the
small
flue
and
always
uses
it
in
the
buildings
he
has
constructed
there
are
many
persons
who
still
maintain
that
the
flue
is
the
correct
one
and
it
is
still
very
generally
used
there
is
an
old
saying
about
the
proof
of
the
pudding
in
belgrave
square
all
the
houses
first
designed
and
erected
have
the
flue
and
there
are
scarcely
a
dozen
of
the
old
left
all
have
been
changed
for
and
other
similar
contrivances
one
house
has
about
in
one
stack
no
built
by
cubitt
about
years
ago
and
having
the
descending
or
sweeping
flue
has
the
stacks
exactly
as
at
first
constructed
with
the
exception
only
of
a
little
doctoring
to
the
kitchen
flue
in
the
house
opposite
no
one
of
the
first
the
external
stack
alone
next
the
street
has
no
less
than
two
of
which
appear
to
be
broken
off
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
square
in
chesham
place

no
built
by
cubitt
about
years
it
has
all
the
original
stacks
untouched
the
cubitt
flue
can
be
recognised
by
the
small
peculiar
cap
on
the
and
several
of
these
stacks
remain
in
their
original
state
in
eaton
place
and
eccleston
square
where
this
flue
is
used
the
roofs
tell
the
same
story
in
the
first
buildings
erected
by
the
author
he
used
the
large
flue
and
he
now
finds
several
specimens
of
on
the
roofs
in
some
large
houses
he
lately
erected
at
gate
in
which
the
sweeping
flue
is
used
there
are
several
houses
together
without
any
disfigurement
at
all
on
the
roof
he
considers
that
the
appearance
of
a
on
one
of
them
would
be
rather
a
proof
that
there
was
something
wrong
about
the
management
of
the
fires
than
an
error
in
the
construction
of
his
flues

to
admit
either
a
large

as
required
numerous
patent
processes
to
effect
this
are
in

the
most
effective
way

doing
it
is
that
shown

the

when

lighted
becomes
very
hot
the
smoke
ascends
speedily
and

formed
expressly
for
it
cubitt
made
the
stoves
only
for
his
own
houses
and
the
author
had
some
difficulty
at
gate
in
procuring
stoves
of
the
right
pattern
for
manufacturers
prefer
their
own
shop
patterns
and
some
of
these
would
have
covered
up
half
the
descending
flue
those
he
used
were
supplied
by
feetham
of
clifford
street
who
are
well
acquainted
with
the
use
of
the
flue
and
stove
the
flue
is
considered
an
excellent
one
it
is
a
flue
constructed
solely
of
brick
and
is
certainly
the
best
of
the
brick
flues
the
same
attention
was
paid
to
it
as
was
given
to
every
part
of
buildings
it
may
be
asked
there
no
other
kinds
of
flues
constructed
of
superior
materials
yes
certainly
there
are
particular
attention
has
often
been
paid
to
the
flue
there
is
circular
flue
formed
in
each
course
of
four
bricks
hiort
held
a
very
important
position
he
was
treasurer
of
the
office
of
works
at
whitehall
and
his
flue
was
extensively
used
in
some
of
the
government
buildings
and
the
houses
in
carlton
gardens
it
did
not
bond
well
with
the
brickwork
so
we
have
improvement
upon
it
this
was
considered
not
sufficient
and
another
patent
was
taken
out
in
by
clark
and
reed
for
its
further
improvement
the
flue
was
an
excellent
one
but
on
retirement
from
the
government

announced
his
determination
of
never

introduced
to

already
erected

allow

to
be
reduced
in
height
without
having
the
unsightly
appearance
of
contractions
made
above

the
drawback
to
the
use
of

tubes
by
builders
was
the
price
without
any
royalty
the
in
tube
cost
per
run
the
curved
tubes
the
starting
tube
the
tubes
were
of
the
exact
form
of
drain
pipes
and
they
were
cheaper
and
as
effectual
if
metal
tubes
had
been
introduced
into
a
large
brick
flue
they
would
have
rendered
the
latter
an
efficient
shaft
for
ventilating
every
room
in
its
upward
course
openings
being
made
for
the
purpose
at
the
upper

of

this
mode
of

was
applied
to
hospitals
on
a
large
scale
by
the
late
jacob
perkins
several
years
ago
with
perfect
success
flue
introduced
in

believed
to
have
been
the
precursor
of
that
used
by
the
late
thos
cubitt
at
belgravia
and
pimlico
and
there
is
a
great
resemblance
between
the
two

nothing
like
the
simplicity
nor
ease
of

of
the
downward
flues
were
merged
into
one
at
the
basement
and
all
the
soot
and
cinders
were
collected
or
thrown
down
into
a
box
which
must
have
stood
out
in
the
lower
rooms
from
which
they
had
to
be
removed
the
flues
were
swept
from
the
roof
the
register
doors
of
the
stoves
being
closed
and
there
was
no
provision
for
sweeping
the
flues
between

basement
and
the

joined
to
his
system
for

one
of

flues
which
brought
a
current
of

direct
from
the

have
several

the
superior
patented
flues
as
they
are
of
considerable
cost
and
take
extra
time
in

are
only
used
in
the
better
class
of
buildings
or
in
those
erected
under
the
express
direction
of
the
owner
in
speculative
buildings
they
are
never
used
the
time
required
for
their
construction
beyond
that
of
the
common
brick
flue
being
regarded
by
the
builder
as
so
much
money
lost
the
great
desideratum
in
a
flue
is
to
make
it
pass
off
its
smoke
quickly
and
this
the
small
size
flue
effects
more
certainly
than
the
larger
one
as
it
warms
sooner
and
keeps
its
heat
longer
an
enthusiastic
admirer
of
the
descending
or
sweeping
flue
once
told
the
author
that
with
a
good
fire
in
the
grate
if
a
kettle
of
water
could
be
placed
on
the
top
of
the
the
water
would
soon
boil
even
if
the
flue
were
fifty
feet
high
the
flues
constructed
of
metallic
or
earthenware
casings
retain
also
the
heat
longer
and
keep
hotter
it
may
be
imagined
that
with
these
flues
and
the
large
quantity
of
gas
lamps
in
the
streets
why
the
temperature
of
london
should
be
always
some
degrees
higher
than
that
of
the
country
in
winter
snow
may
be
seen
in
the
suburban
fields
but
none
is
found
in
town
architects
have
often
been
blamed
for
not
inventing
a
good
system
of
not
only
for
the
prevention
of
smoke
in
our
dwellings
but
for
the
hindrance
of
its
presence
in
the
atmosphere
several
and
most
excellent
attempts
have
been
made
for
the
former
but
very
few
for
the
latter
which
is
one
of
far
greater
difficulty
yet
this
is
one
that
admits
of
a
cure
great
as
the
evil
is
the
chimney
flue
might
be
so
improved
as
to
effect
a
more
certain
and
larger
ventilation
of
our
houses
without
any
addition
of
ventilation
flues
the
introduction
of
the
french
mansard
roof
with
us
one
from
a
country
where
coal
fires
are
not
in
use
renders
it
almost
imperative
for
the
chimneys
belonging
to
such
buildings
to
have
a
different
construction
for
chimneys
when
placed
against
a
building
or
roof
that
overtops
them
are
sure
as
they
are
at
present
made
to
become
smoky
the
wind
returning
owing
to
the
high
construction
and
descending
in
the
flues
the
following
few
designs
are
offered
to
cure
these
various
evils
accepting
as
a
fact
that
and
the
other
iron
and
zinc
constructions
are
useful
appendages
there
can
be
no
reason
why
they
should
be
so
used
as
to
disfigure
our
buildings
some
of
the
finest
specimens
of
architecture
in
the
metropolis
serve
only
as
pedestals
to
an
ugly
collection
of
cowls
the
author
proposes
to
form
the
upper
part
of
the
flues
in
a
building
for
a
length
of
about
to
feet
entirely
of
iron
or
other
tubing
in
square
round
or
oblong
sections
of
a
less
diameter
than
the
brick
flues
to
which
they
are
attached
this
tubing
is
gathered
up
in
groups
and
carried
out
at
an
angle
of
towards
a
centre
stack
the
tubes
in
direct
contact
with
each
other
having
no
brick
wyths
except
one
or
two
to
strengthen
the
stack
it
is
obvious
that
if
only
one
of
the
flues
be
in
use
it
would
moderately
warm
those
next
to
it
and
if
the
whole
of
the
flues
of
a
building
were
constructed
on
this
plan
and
two
or
three
were
in
use
such
a
power
would
be
obtained
as
would
effectually
ventilate
every
room
the
action
would
be
continuous
and
imperceptible
and
a
fire
could
be
lighted
in
any
one
without
the
risk
of
return
smoke
from
a
cold
or
damp
flue
thus
the
heat
now
wasted
in
the
atmosphere
by
the
action
of
the
common
flue
would
be
partly
retained
and
turned
to
use
and
the
draught
of
the
flue
very
much
improved
this
tubing
could
be
readily
introduced
into
either
old
or
new
buildings
as
the
introduction
does
not
involve
taking
down
more
than
twelve
feet
of
the
brickwork
measuring
from
the
top
of
the
coping
the
tubes
could
never
become
sufficiently
heated
to
be
dangerous
and
less
brickwork
would
be
required
they
might
be
made
either
of
zinc
or
earthenware
would
be
objectionable
on
account
of
its
weight
it
will
be
seen
that
they
admit
a
better
mode
of
sweeping
than
that
now
practised
and
they
could
easily
have
some
kind
of
capping
to
prevent
these
should
commence
from
the
attic
or
upper
storey
of
a
building
at
about
six
feet
from
the
floor
sweeping
doors
should
be
placed
beneath
them
so
as
to
give
the
sweep
command
of
the
flue
beneath
as
well
as
above
each
flue
should
be
composed
of
three
separate
forms
of
tubing
by
which
the
various
directions
and
turns
necessary
for
the
construction
might
be
obtained

provides
larger
outlets
for

in

words
it

adopted
on

principle

law

that
when

remove

our

the
best
scheme
for
this

a
matter
of
important
consideration

few
have
been
proposed
it
may
be
asked
what
has

work
on

architecture
to
do
with

the

in

considers
that

patches
of

eminent

once
affirmed

were
improved
by
their
soot
covering
because
it
made

boldly
out
against
the
sky
but
those
beautiful
decorated
smoke
towers
which
stand
on
the
roof
of
the
houses
of
parliament
and
which
are
as
black
as
erebus
look
anything
but
pleasing
standing
amidst
the
whiter
front
of
the
rest
of
the
building
besides
are
beginning
to
make
their
appearance
on
the
roof
under
the
victoria
tower
and
these
certainly
form
no
part
of
the
architecture
but
appear
monstrously
ugly
consequently
smoke
and
its
abolition
are
clearly
questions
to
be
considered
in
relation
to
picturesque
architecture
a
plan
for
removing
smoke
from
the
atmosphere
of
towns
and
at
the
same
time
ventilating
buildings
and
sewers
was
proposed
in
by
flockton
surveyor
to
the
town
trustees
of
sheffield
f
a
town
as
much
begrimed
with
sooty
smoke
only
in
a
smaller
way
as
the
metropolis
the
proposal
was
that
under
the
footways
along
the
side
of
every
street
and
lane
flues
should
be
constructed
of
sufficient
capacity
to
carry
off
all
the
smoke
and
other
atmospheric
impurities
these
flues
all
converging
upon
a
general
plan
to
tall
shafts
or
chimneys
at
some
distance
from
the
town
and
supplied
with
furnaces
these
when
the
fires
were
once
ignited
would
give
a
fire
produced
by
the
combustion
of
the
inflammable
gases
accompanying
the
smoke
and
which
would
burn
spontaneously
in
a
similar
manner
to
the
combustion
of
foul
air
from
old
shafts
connected
with
coal
mines
the
combustion
might
be
assisted
by
jets
of
coal
gas
in
a
fire
of
coke
in
very
large
towns
it
would
be
necessary
flockton
added
to
divide
the
whole
into
districts
and
to
erect
towers
in
the
centre
of
each
to
which
all
the
flues
should
converge
he
published
a
plate
showing
two
large
with
a
street
between
the
common
sewer
in
the
middle
of
the
carriage
way
and
the
smoke
flues
on
each
side
under
the
footpaths
also
showing
the
connexion
between
the
sewer
and
flue
the
alteration
proposed
to
houses
already
erected
consisted
in
converting
ascending
into
descending
flues
turning
the
smoke
from
the
into
the
latter
and
from
thence
into
the
street
flue
this
operation
would
have
necessitated
the
pulling
down
and
rebuilding
of
the
flue
walls
the
street
smoke
flues
in
order
to
carry
off
the
smoke
from
a
few
thousand
chimneys
would
require
to
have
been
made
of
a
size
even
larger
than
the
sewer
itself
provision
must
have
been
made
for
clearing
out
the
soot
for
the
smoke
would
have
been
cooled
and
the
soot
would
accumulate
in
large
quantities
in
them
the
same
scheme
with
similar
constructions
was
proposed
by
a
foreign
gentleman
who
took
out
a
patent
for
it
in
no
his
plan
was
a
very
grand
one
he
did
not
propose
alterations
in
existing
buildings
but
pulled
them
down
and
gave
designs
for
a
new
city
a
more
practical
plan
was
proposed
about
by
devey
a
surveyor
of
inn
a
model
of
his
invention
was
in
the
great
exhibition
of
and
it
is
described
and
an
engraving
given
of
it
in
the
illustrated
volumes
published
by
the
royal
exhibition
commissioners
at
the
close
of
the
exhibition
the
model
is
now
in
the
museum
at
south
kensington
plan
was
to
make
only
one
descending
flue
to
each
building
to
which
the
flues
at
the
top
could
be
either
connected
or
not
at
pleasure
the
descending
flue
was
carried
to
the
sewer
in
the
middle
of
the
street
and
the
action
of
this
was
to
be
assisted
by
the
heat
of
the
kitchen
fire
he
says
smoke
would
be
drawn
down
by
the
current
produced
by
exhaustion
in
the
sewer
the
action
being
assisted
by
the
kitchen
devey
did
not
propose
to
have
furnace
shafts
but
depended
entirely
upon
the
sewer
acting
as
an
exhaust
in
this
scheme
the
objections
were
that
one
descending
flue
was
not
sufficient
to
carry
off
the
smoke
from
several
chimneys
and
the
sewer
certainly
would
not
act
as
an
exhaust
without
its
being
connected
with
upright
furnaces
our
sewers
generally
have
ventilating
openings
which
permit
their
odours
to
ascend
into
our
streets
soot
would
no
doubt
neutralize
these
odours
this
a
paper
in
a
late
april
admits
first
speaking
of
the
sewer
gases
the
reviewer
says
offensive
gases
have
often
engendered
formidable
diseases
and
have
in
several
instances
of
late
been
clearly
shown
to
have
caused
the
outbreak
both
of
typhoid
fever
and
of
this
the
author
has
had
proof
during
the
outbreak
of
cholera
in
london
in
he
was
superintending
the
construction
of
a
mass
of
buildings
in
one
of
the
worst
dwelling
districts
in
london
this
builder
who
had
just
finished
the
erection
of
harrington
house
a
description
of
which
is
given
in
this
volume
died
the
first
night
of
the
outbreak
in
the
greatest
agony
he
was
a
strong
robust
man
from
one
to
three
deaths
took
place
in
every
house
in
the
locality
a
black
flag
was
put
up
in
the
streets
and
the
foul
fiend
reigned
for
a
while
supreme
a
large
mass
of
the
worst
buildings
have
been
cleared
away
and
model
erected
but
a
considerable
portion
of
the
rotten
old
structures
remain
the
sewers
are
untouched
and
the
visitation
of
the
cholera
forgotten
the
says
there
is
no
reason
why
ordinary
sewers
should
not
be
made
to
serve
the
double
purpose
of
carrying
off
smoke
and
sewage
at
the
same
time
provided
they
were
connected
here
and
there
with
high
shafts
rendered
powerfully
expansive
by
furnaces
and
adds
would
be
improved
for
agricultural
purposes
by
admixture
with
soot
which
is
an
excellent
manure
and
the
noxious
qualities
of
the
sewer
gases
would
be
whether
soot
would
increase
the
value
of
sewage
or
decrease
it
is
a
question
for
chemists
to
decide
a
generally
increasing
opinion
is
that
our
method
of
using
sewage
by
liquefaction
and
sending
it
away
is
a
mistake
and
renders
it
quite
worthless
and
that
the
system
of
dry
is
more
conformable
to
laws
the
subject
was
taken
up
in
by
peter
spence
of
manchester
a
large
alum
manufacturer
g
this
gentleman
states
that
the
the
horror
of
the
londoner
are
guiltless
of
any
deleterious
effect
to
human
health
as
carbon
is
one
of
the
most
of
bodies
and
while
floating
in
the
atmosphere
over
everything
arrest
and
destroy
noxious
and
miasmatic
vapours
perfect
freedom
from
smoke
would
if
accomplished
only
increase
the
evil
arising
from
the
purely
gaseous
results
of
combustion
he
proposed
a
system
of
or
and
the
complete
removal
of
all
their
gases
to
a
safe
distance
from
our
towns
he
would
combine
this
gaseous
sewage
in
such
a
form
with
town
drainage
as
would
bring
all
the
liquid
sewage
into
contact
with
the
gases
from
our
furnaces
and
house
fires
the
liquid
sewage
being
kept
from
all
surface
drainage
the
same
liquid
and
f≈ìtid
mass
of
sewage
he
would
concentrate
in
an
innoxious
form
to
be
converted
in
a
convenient
place
where
it
might
with
perfect
safety
be
manufactured
into
manure
more
valuable
than
the
richest
guano
for
effecting
this
all
the
gases
from
our
coal
combustion
would
have
to
be
conveyed
along
the
same
tunnel
with
the
sewage
to
centralizing
conduits
converging
to
a
point
where
an
immense
chimney
high
should
be
erected
to
discharge
these
gases
into
the
atmosphere
the
ascensive
power
being
obtained
either
from
the
retained
heat
of
the
gases
which
would
probably
be
found
quite
sufficient
or
if
not
artificial
heat
could
then
be
applied
to
effect
the
object
the
chimney
should
be
of
the
internal
diameter
of
at
the
top
and
external
diameter
at
the
bottom
this
would
take
the
smoke
from
chimneys
and
every
particle
of
foul
emanation
from
the
sewer
and
every
leak
or
opening
to
the
upward
air
from
these
sewers
would
not
then
emit
foul
gases
but
draw
in
fresh
air
with
a
pressure
or
suction
of
three
and
a
half
pounds
per
foot
and
with
a
velocity
of
feet
per
second
this
gentleman
says
is
idle
to
talk
of
trapping
and
thus
confining
gases
evolved
under
ground
exit
they
must
and
will
have
and
when
you
imagine
you
have
secured
them
in
one
place
you
will
find
them
pouring
out
in
he
makes
this
plain
by
an
illustration
he
took
an
detached
house
after
entering
into
possession
he
found
frequently
very
disagreeable
smells
especially
after
rain
a
change
of
wind
or
a
fall
of
the
barometer
it
may
be
remarked
here
that
it
was
not
necessary
to
take
an
house
to
find
out
this
in
more
modern
built
houses
in
london
after
a
fall
in
the
barometer
or
rain
such
a
thing
is
repeatedly
occurring
spence
to
cure
the
evil
in
his
old
mansion
exhausted
all
the
remedies
which
the
philosophy
of
london
schemes
acknowledges
he
trapped
all
the
exits
from
the
sewer
with
the
most
approved
patent
girds
all
slopstone
pipes
were
cut
and
but
this
was
of
no
use
the
smell
came
through
the
very
walls
and
floors
and
one
bedroom
on
the
first
floor
which
showed
no
connexion
with
the
sewer
was
quite
uninhabitable
he
adopted
a
plan
which
succeeded
a
branch
from
the
main
sewer
was
brought
right
under
the
kitchen
grate
from
that
a
pipe
of
cast
iron
four
inches
in
diameter
was
carried
up
through
the
brickwork
and
the
open
top
projected
into
the
chimney
a
yard
and
a
half
behind
the
kitchen
fire
above
the
fire
when
this
fire
was
again
lighted
in
a
few
hours
the
house
was
perfectly
sweet
and
the
distant
bedroom
uninhabitable
before
has
been
slept
in
ever
since
when
this
nuisance
occurs
in
a
london
house
the
only
remedy
is
to
open
the
doors
and
windows
to
get
rid
of
it
as
we
are
not
allowed
to
meddle
with
the
sewers
disagreeable
effluvia
in
dwellings
often
occur
and
baffle
every
endeavour
to
trace
from
where
they
proceed
in
every
case
it
is
from
drains
or
the
sewer
and
the
decomposition
of
animal
and
vegetable
matter
therein
retained
as
for
scheme
its
grandeur
almost
stops
its
execution
it
is
well
known
that
in
all
large
manufactories
and
in
gas
works
a
tall
chimney
serves
to
draw
out
the
smoke
from
the
numerous
fires
and
it
forms
a
for
them
all
in
most
of
these
places
the
fuel
is
used
up
so
completely
that
it
is
only
the
gases
of
combustion
that
are
drawn
away
scheme
has
been
successfully
tried
in
its
application
to
private
residences
and
also
on
a
large
scale
to
the
new
assize
courts
in
manchester
it
was
adopted
by
one
of
the
architects
in
the
competitive
designs
for
the
new
law
courts
in
london
if
these
tall
shafts
and
furnaces
were
applied
in
london
it
may
be
questioned
whether
the
smoke
in
cooling
would
not
deposit
the
soot
in
the
sewer
and
this
must
be
removed
if
not
run
off
by
water
the
flues
connecting
the
house
fires
with
the
sewer
would
be
partly
horizontal
and
these
would
certainly
fill
with
soot
and
no
machines
we
have
at
present
in
use
could
clean
out
these
flues
from
above
the
operation
must
be
performed
from
within
the
sewer
and
then
these
flues
being
unsupplied
with
at
their
entrance
to
the
sewer
would
form
so
many
open
channels
for
the
passage
of
the
sewer
gases
into
the
houses
this
would
be
the
case
in
a
very
great
degree
where
there
were
no
fires
in
the
stoves
and
their
register
doors
were
open
it
would
require
an
immense
consumption
of
fuel
in
the
high
stalks
to
cause
a
current
to
prevent
it
and
the
furnaces
must
be
close
together
to
lessen
the
cooling
effects
of
cold
currents
of
air
from
flues
not
in
use
as
to
the
mere
ventilation
of
the
sewer
itself
it
could
easily
be
effected
by
single
drain
pipes
inches
in
diameter
placed
at
intervals
from
the
sewer
to
the
of
any
neighbouring
furnace
it
would
be
probably
to
the
advantage
of
the
furnace
itself
as
even
the
tall
stalks
must
sometimes
make
black
smoke
a
legislative
enactment
should
require
their
owners
to
let
them
perform
this
service
it
might
require
strong
furnaces
and
plenty
of
them
to
effect
it
a
suggestion
for
getting
rid
of
that
nuisance
london
was
made
known
in
the
about
by
bruce
neil
it
is
thus
described
plan
consists
in
placing
small
tanks
containing
water
over
the
chimney
the
being
fixed
inside
the
tanks
and
made
of
a
spiral
and
bent
form
the
chill
of
the
water
gradually
condenses
the
smoke
which
becomes
decomposed
and
destroyed
being
precipitated
at
the
bottom
of
the
tank
in
the
form
of
mineral
tar
the
water
is
turned
on
and
off
daily
it
will
be
here
observed
that
in
the
event
of
a
fire
in
the
chimney
the
flames
can
not
spread
as
they
are
immediately
quenched
by
the
water
in
the
tank
according
to
bruce
calculation
the
smoke
of
tons
of
coal
if
collected
will
yield
upwards
of
barrels
of
tar
of
cwt
each
he
proposes
that
the
legislature
or
the
society
of
arts
should
offer
a
premium
to
the
person
who
will
undertake
to
rid
us
of
this
monster
nuisance
and
convert
the
smoke
into
tar
so
as
to
make
it
applicable
to
commercial
purposes
in
the
adoption
of
the
above
plan
a
slight
alteration
in
the
mode
of
ventilating
our
apartments
is
all
that
is
required
he
tells
us
as
to
the
possibility
of
converting
smoke
into
tar
by
such
means
as
are
above
described
some
doubts
might
be
expressed
if
it
could
really
be
done
the
remedy
would
be
worse
even
than
the
disease
every
household
using
yearly
tons
of
coal
would
have
in
that
time
to
remove
barrels
or
cwt
of
tar
from
their
roof
the
in
publishing
this
suggestion
did
not
give
any
diagram
or
sketch
showing
how
the
process
was
to
be
effected
bruce
neil
no
doubt
made
one
as
he
speaks
of
the
alteration
required
in
the
ventilation
of
our
apartments
a
drawing
would
at
least
have
explained
how
the
water
was
to
collect
the
soot
and
how
it
was
to
have
access
to
the
flue
in
case
of
its
being
on
fire
the
suggestion
of
collecting
soot
at
the
by
means
of
water
was
a
valuable
one
and
there
is
no
doubt
it
could
be
done
to
some
extent
but
not
by
encircling
the
pots
with
cold
water
which
would
chill
the
smoke
and
prevent
the
soot
from
rising
a

collecting

half

how
it

it
will
be

that
the

a
zinc
cover
carried
by
stout
ironwork
surrounding

is
the

the

it
would

the

as
to

service
for
the
roof
of
our
houses
to
the

companies
would
not
do
our
climate
is
more
damp
than
cold
and
a
considerable
quantity
of
rain
falls
on
our
roofs
the
zinc

is
spread
out
so
as
to
retain
as
large
a
portion
as
possible
of
the
in
winter
when
there
is
most
smoke
there
is
most
water
with
little
or
no
evaporation
a
pool
of
water
could
be
thus
collected
and
the
smoke
projected
over
it
would
lose
some
portion
of
its
soot
which
could
be
floated
away
by
the
pipe
into
a
receptacle
provided
for
it
in
the
back
yard
the
water
might
be
sent
into
the
drain
and
the
soot
left
or
it
could
be
sent
into
the
drain
as
well
the
arrows
in
the
diagram
show
the
direction
of
the
smoke
and
the
cover
is
so
spread
out
and
curved
as
to
render
it
unlikely
for
any
violent
wind
to
flow
out
both
water
and
soot
into
the
street
beneath
certainly
coal
smoke
is
a
great
nuisance
it
is
yearly
pointed
out
as
such
by
our
paper
the
in
one
probably
two
very
excellently
written
leaders
even
the
youngest
member
of
the
press
the
in
one
of
the
common
london
fogs
occurring
in
april
thus
remarks
most
sad
and
remarkable
circumstance
about
the
fog
of
yesterday
was
that
the
newspapers
and
people
in
the
streets
spoke
of
it
as
a
as
a
pall
as
if
indeed
the
black
darkness
was
something
as
strange
and
unaccountable
as
a
fall
of
frogs
or
fishes
from
the
sky
of
course
it
was
nothing
but
our
own
familiar
coal
smoke
which
stopped
the
way
of
the
sunlight
it
is
most
lamentable
that
londoners
are
becoming
so
used
to
this
filthy
nuisance
that
nothing
more
than
a
passing
exclamation
is
uttered
when
it
is
forced
down
upon
them
in
such
volumes
as
to
produce
almost
the
darkness
of
midnight
at
midday
if
is
next
to
godliness
then
the
people
of
london
must
have
been
yesterday
the
most
ungodly
people
in
the
world
for
nothing
would
remain
clean
which
was
exposed
to
the
fog
of
that
morning
a
plague
of
locusts
would
not
create
more
terror
and
sense
of
ruin
in
any
foreign
capital
where
every
article
of
dress
and
furniture
and
house
decoration
both
external
and
internal
would
have
been
regarded
as
spoiled
by
the
loss
of
freshness
but
london
received
its
coat
of
dirt
yesterday
and
only
wonders
with
the
remark
dark
it
was
will
nothing
move
us
to
abate
the
nuisance
is
there
no
hope
but
that
distant
one
of
the
exhaustion
of
our
must
we
inhale
and
always
contemplate
dirty
houses
and
grimy
furniture
is
it
not
possible
by
smoke
sewers
or
some
contrivance
or
machinery
to
relieve
us
of
this
plague
it
is
very
possible
it
could
be
done
with
the
greatest
ease
but
at
some
first
expense
and
in
some
generation
or
other
it
will
be
written
that
it
found
london
foul
and
left
it
sweet
and
there
will
be
a
time
when
this
will
be
appreciated
and
the
man
who
gives
the
city
the
pure
atmosphere
of
a
small
country
town
will
receive
all
due
honour
and
acknowledgment
that
is
when
he
is
in
his
grave
and
securely
buried
the
public
have
so
long
been
accustomed
to
be
choked
with
smoke
and
their
health
affected
by
deleterious
gases
that
they
look
upon
the
proposal
of
any
scheme
to
secure
pure
air
as
the
hallucinations
of
dreamy
philosophers
or
inexperienced
utopians
none
of
our
present
flues
can
in
the
very
slightest
degree
stop
these
aqueous
vapours
from
ascending
into
the
atmosphere
neither
can
they
effect
any
purification
of
the
smoke
or
retain
the
blacks
for
any
useful
purpose
and
it
is
of
no
use
disguising
the
fact
that
any
contrivance
or
appliance
to
effect
either
of
these
most
desirable
objects
must
consist
of
an
additional
construction
to
the
flue
which
will
be
attended
with
additional
expense
and
require
extra
attention
therefore
any
such
appliance
if
introduced
should
be
effectual
and
repay
such
additional
cost
to
its
owner
by
a
saving
or
at
least
a
more
economical
use
of
fuel
the
appliance
to
the
flue
the
author
has
to
recommend
he
considers
will
not
only
cause
an
economical
use
of
the
fuel
by
not
permitting
the
present
waste
of
heat
but
it
will
purify
the
smoke
and
retain
the
blacks
for
any
useful
object
to
which
they
can
be
applied
the
principle
of
the
flue
at
present
is
to
get
rid
of
all
vapour
smoke
and
soot
as
soon
as
possible
without
the
slightest
consideration
for
the
people
outside
that
the
smoke
should
not
return
to
annoy
the
occupants
within
the
house
is
the
aim
of
the
constructors
and
to
secure
this
the
waste
of
heat
in
the
chimney
and
the
consequent
waste
of
fuel
is
considered
of
no
importance
for
is
it
not
the
hot
smoke
that
carries
up
the
soot
and
ventilates
the
apartment
this
operation
of
the
flue
could
be
taken
advantage
of
in
the
construction
of
in
a
wall
they
are
often
turned
at
an
angle
to
the
right
or
left
to
pass
an
obstruction
such
as
a
fireplace
or
timber
placed
within
or
against
the
wall
a
flue
could
easily
be
taken
out
of
the
wall
and
returned
and
if
the
part
so
taken
out
was
formed
in
cast
iron
with
a
small
cistern
of
water
at
top
it
would
become
a
pedestal
and
could
moderately
warm
or
air
an
apartment
in
which
it
was
placed
the
author
calls
this
the
flue

it
is

about
three

the

a
small
tap
supplying
warm

thus
the
upper

could
be
warmed

aired
by
the
fires
below
in
perfect
safety
and
the
present
waste
of
heat
in
the
flues
prevented
this
would
be
economical
as
in
most
cases
no
fires
would
be
necessary
in
the
upper
rooms
the
flue
thus
brought
out
in
iron
could
contain
a
fine
spray
of
water
that
would
draw
up
the

take
down
its

the
whole

contrivance
by
which
the

believes
the
smoke
of

could
be
got
rid
of
or
rendered
inoffensive
what
the
action
of
the
water
would
be
on
the
gases
that
escape
from
the
fuel
he
can
not
say
but
he
presumes
it
could
not
be
other
than
beneficial
he
experimented
on
the
subject
a
few
years
ago
and
had
a
stove
and
flue
erected
about
ten
feet
in
height
the
lower
part
of
the
stove
was
of
brick
the
upper
part
with
the
cistern
of
zinc
the
coal
fire
was
lighted
and
as
soon
as
black
smoke
appeared
at
the
the
was
lifted
and
about
fine
jets
of
water
were
sprayed
against
a
piece
of
loose
perforated
zinc
suspended
in
the
flue
this
zinc
is
shown
in
fig
in
the
second
flue
it
should
have
been
marked
but
by
a
mistake
in
the
cutting
it
is
made
the
smoke
had
to
pass
through
under
this
perforated
zinc
to
get
to
the
chimney
above
on
the
instant
the
water
was
applied
the
smoke
appeared
at
the
of
a
light
colour
and
it
came
out
of
the
soot
receptacle
placed
a
little
height
above
the
ground
nearly
as
much
as
it
did
at
top
and
of
a
similar
light
vapourish
character
h
a
sure
sign
that
it
was
drawn
down
by
the
current
of
water
soot
in
large
quantities
was
soon
seen
in
the
receptacle
the
author
has
not
ascertained
the
quantity
of
soot
which
would
be
obtained
by
this
process
from
a
ton
of
coals
but
he
believes
it
would
be
very
considerable
possibly
two
sacks
or
more
as
clean
unmixed
soot
is
worth
in
london
per
sack
if
this
soot
were
retained
it
would
pay
for
the
extra
expense
of
the
water
and
the
retaining
of
it
and
to
carry
off
the
water
would
be
an
easy
operation
the
are
good
things
at
present
in
their
wrong
place
they
could
in
the
way
proposed
be
very
easily
got
rid
of
and
if
it
were
possible
to
cut
into
all
the
chimneys
of
london
and
apply
the
remedy
the
whole
of
the
soot
which
at
present
escapes
into
the
atmosphere
might
be
caught
and
passed
into
the
drains
it
would
there
probably
fully
deodorize
them
it
is
certainly
not
possible
from
the
herculean
nature
of
the
task
to
disturb
the
whole
of
the
chimneys
of
london
but
the
worst
only
might
be
operated
upon
such
as
the
chief
kitchen
flues
of
the
great
establishments
which
are
continually
sending
out
black
smoke
among
the
chief
offenders
are
our
bakers
nearly
twenty
of
them
being
fined
weekly
for
this
by
the
magistrates
and
for
fires
occurring
in
their
chimneys
it
appears
that
the
smoke
nuisance
act
bears
hardly
upon
them
the
apparatus
forced
upon
them
by
the
act
has
utterly
failed
in
its
purpose
and
it
is
impossible
for
them
to
comply
with
the
requirements
of
the
act
and
carry
on
their
business
in
a
satisfactory
manner
either
to
themselves
or
the
public
they
have
applied
to
the
home
secretary
for
relief
and
a
bill
to
repeal
so
much
of
the
act
and
vict
that
relates
to
bakehouses
has
been
in
contemplation
there
would
be
no
difficulty
in
placing
a
flue
pedestal
in
their
flues
at
any
height
above
their
oven
fires
it
would
not
only
relieve
their
neighbours
from
the
annoyance
of
black
smoke
from
their
chimneys
but
it
would
secure
the
chimneys
themselves
from
taking
fire
the
water
need
only
be
turned
on
when
required
when
black
smoke
was
being
made
and
if
they
chose
to
collect
the
soot
the
expense
of
the
operation
would
be
trifling
if
anything
beyond
the
first
expense
of
the
flue
pedestal
in
the
end
in
large
country
houses
the
flue
pedestal
would
warm
the
upper
rooms
or
passages
and
cause
a
more
equal
temperature
in
the
building
this
together
with
the
practicability
of
collecting
the
soot
for
agricultural
purposes
might
be
an
inducement
to
its
introduction
water
could
be
lifted
to
the
roof
of
a
country
mansion
by
that
ingenious
contrivance
the
hydraulic
ram
and
passed
off
to
its
original
source
when
done
with
the
soot
being
left
behind
the
beautiful
machine
known
as
gwynne
and
improved
hydraulic
ram
is
peculiarly
adapted
for
raising
or
lifting
water
to
any
required
elevation
it
is
necessary
to
have
a
fall
of
water
to
work
it
and
the
greater
the
height
of
the
fall
the
more
effective
will
be
the
machine
in
favourable
cases
it
will
raise
water
thirty
times
higher
than
the
fall
working
it
the
greater
the
height
of
the
lift
of
course
the
less
will
be
the
quantity
raised
in
a
given
time
this
machine
can
be
made
to
deliver
comparatively
large
quantities
of
water
either
in
tanks
on
the
roofs
of
houses
or
in
farmyards
for
filling
ponds
it
will
work
day
and
night
without
any
attendance
or
expense
after
it
is
once
fixed
two
or
more
rams
may
be
used
to
force
through
the
same
pipe
or
rising
main
where
a
continuous
stream
of
water
to
work
the
machine
can
not
be
obtained

spring
or
even
rainfall
or
drainage
may
be
stored
up
in
a
reservoir
or
dam
and
made
to

of
these

is
not

the
question
of
how
far
the
removal
of
smoke
from
the
atmosphere
would
affect
the
various
gases
of
combustion
floating
therein
is
a
question
for
the
chemist
the
plan
that
has
been
here
proposed
is
founded
on
the
supposition
that
law
relative
to
the
diffusion
of
gases
permits
only
carbonic
acid
gas
the
chief
product
of
combustion
to
remain
in
the
proportion
of
in
the
introduction
of
so
much
water
in
the
sewer
where
its
presence
already
is
considered
an
injury
to
the
sewage
is
an
objection
but
the
present
system
of
drainage
requires
a
plentiful
supply
of
water
to
prevent
stoppages
or
choking
should
the
dry
earth
system
ever
be
generally
introduced
the
present
sewers
would
serve
to
remove
liquid
sewage
and
all
products
of
combustion
the
operation
of
the
sewer
in
any
way
in
receiving
this
smoke
and
soot
would
permit
the
full
and
cheering

twined
round
it
naturally
would
look
a
great
deal
better
than
formal

of
stiff

some
of
our
latest
gothic
architects
who
were
at
the
same
time
artists
did
not
trouble
themselves
to
draw
out
according
to
rule
the
geometric
lines
for
the
foliation
of
their
gothic
windows
they
knew
the
principles
thoroughly
but
merely
made
the
vertical
lines
correct
and
then
sketched
in
the
foliation
with
a
free
hand
this
gave
an
outline
greatly
superior
to
the
usual
stiff
conventional
forms
some
examples
of
this
may
be
seen
in

the

considerable

the

enumeration
of
these
would
require
every
letter
in

to
point
them
out
in

as
it

desirable
to
show
how
closely

be
packed

the

the

the
exterior
of

has
been
censured
on
account
of
the
gothic
outline
being
too
flat
the
roofs
too
low
and
all
the
windows
having
common
sash
illustration
frames
with
regard
to
the
latter
it
may
be
considered
very
probable
that
if
the
gothic
race
of
architects
had
continued
with
us
to
the
present
day
they
would
have
adopted
plate
glass
for
their
windows
and
put
aside
their
and
small
panes
of
common
glass
one
of
the
greatest
improvements
that
could
be
made
in
our
cathedrals
not
excepting
even
would
be

the
construction
of
a

a
short
description

which

some
peculiarity

can
plead
as

stated
in

that
the

have
read
this
book
with
the
greatest
pleasure
considered
merely
as
a
composition
it
deserves
to
be
classed
among
the
best
specimens
of
english
prose
which
our
age
has
produced
it
contains
indeed
no
single
passage
equal
to
two
or
three
which
we
could
select
from
the
life
of
sheridan
but
as
a
whole
it
is
immeasurably
superior
to
that
work
the
style
is
agreeable
clear
and
manly
and
when
it
rises
into
eloquence
rises
without
effort
or
ostentation
nor
is
the
matter
inferior
to
the
manner
it
would
be
difficult
to
name
a
book
which
exhibits
more
kindness
fairness
and
modesty
it
has
evidently
been
written
not
for
the
purpose
of
showing
what
however
it
often
shows
how
well
its
author
can
write
but
for
the
purpose
of
vindicating
as
far
as
truth
will
permit
the
memory
of
a
celebrated
man
who
can
no
longer
vindicate
himself
moore
never
thrusts
himself
between
lord
byron
and
the
public
with
the
strongest
temptations
to
egotism
he
has
said
no
more
about
himself
than
the
subject
absolutely
required
a
great
part
indeed
the
greater
part
of
these
volumes
consists
of
extracts
from
the
letters
and
journals
of
lord
byron
and
it
is
difficult
to
speak
too
highly
of
the
skill
which
has
been
shown
in
the
selection
and
arrangement
it
is
impossible
on
a
general
survey
to
deny
that
the
task
has
been
executed
with
great
judgment
and
great
humanity
when
we
consider
the
life
which
lord
byron
had
led
his
petulance
his
irritability
and
his
communicativeness
we
can
not
but
admire
the
dexterity
with
which
moore
has
contrived
to
exhibit
so
much
of
the
character
and
opinions
of
his
friend
with
so
little

i
was
not

made
aware

my
own
deficiencies
but
surprised
to
find
how
much
more
vague
are
the
explanations
and
contradictory
the
statements
of
our
best
authorities
than
they
appeared
to
me
when
in
the
plenitude
of
my
ignorance
i
rushed
upon
almost
untrodden
ground
and
felt
bewildered
by
the
mass
of
unsifted
evidence
and
unhesitating
assertion
which
met
my
eyes
at
every
turn
during
the
forty
years
which
have
elapsed
since
the
publication
of
the
first
edition
of
my
of
british
in
the
of
entertaining
knowledge
arch√¶ological
investigation
has
received
such
an
impetus
by
the
establishment
of
metropolitan
and
provincial
peripatetic
antiquarian
societies
that
a
flood
of
light
has
been
poured
upon
us
by
which
we
are
enabled
to
our
opinions
and
discover
reasons
to
doubt
if
we
can
not
find
facts
to
authenticate
that
the
former
greatly
preponderate
is
a
grievous
acknowledgment
to
make
after
assiduously
devoting
the
leisure
of
half
my
life
to
the
pursuit
of
information
on
this
to
me
most
fascinating
subject
it
is
some
consolation
however
to
feel
that
where
i
can
not
instruct
i
shall
certainly
not
mislead
and
that
the
reader
will
find
under
each
head
all
that
is
known
to
or
suggested
by
the
most
competent
writers
i
am
acquainted
with
either
here
or
on
the
continent
that
this
work
appears
in
a
glossarial
form
arises
from
the
desire
of
many
artists
who
have
expressed
to
me
the
difficulty
they
constantly
meet
with
in
their
endeavours
to
ascertain
the
complete
form
of
a
garment
or
the
exact
mode
of
fastening
a
piece
of
armour
or
buckling
of
a
belt
from
their
study

a
sepulchral
effigy

figure
in
an
illumination
the
attitude
of
the
personages
represented
or
the
disposition
of
other
portions
of

attire
effectually
preventing

requisite
examination
the

any
such
information
are

few

most

swinburne
is
not
only
a
master
of

he
has

indescribable
touch
which

the
touch
that
lifts

not
too
much
to
say
that
should
he
never

more
the
poet
has
by
this
work
firmly
established
his
position
and
given
us
a
poem
upon
which
his
fame
may
safely
rest
he
no
longer
indulges
in
that
frequent
alliteration
or
that
oppressive
wealth
of
imagery

colour
which
gave
rhythm
and
splendour
to
some
of
his
works
but
would
have
been
out
of

poem
we
have
now
a
fair
opportunity
of
judging
what
the
poet
can
do
when
deprived
of
such
adventitious
aid
and
the
verdict
is
that
he
must
henceforth
rank
amongst
the
first
