the
material
out
of
which
the
story
of
the
colored
regulars
has
been
constructed
has
been
collected
with
great
pains
and
upon
it
has
been
expended
a
serious
amount
of
labor
and
care
all
the
movements
of
the
cuban
campaign
and
particularly
of
the
battles
have
been
carefully
studied
by
the
aid
of
official
reports
and
conversations
and
correspondence
with
those
who
participated
in
them
the
work
has
been
performed
with
an
earnest
desire
to
obtain
and
present
the
truth
hoping
that
the
reader
will
be
inspired
by
it
to
a
more
profound
respect
for
the
brave
and
skilled
black
men
who
passed
through
that
severe
baptism
of
fire
and
suffering
contributing
their
full
share
to
their
country
honor
it
is
also
becoming
in
this
place
to
mention
with
gratitude
the
encouragement
given
by
the
war
department
both
in
granting
me
the
time
in
which
to
do
the
work
and
also
in
supplying
me
with
documents
and
furnishing
other
facilities
by
this
enlightened
course
on
the
part
of
the
department
great
aid
has
been
given
to
historical
science
and
incidentally
very
important
service
rendered
to
the
cause
of
freedom
and
humanity
a
struggling
people
has
been
helped
and
further
glory
reflected
upon
the
government
the
president
himself
has
manifested
a
kindly
interest
in
the
work
and
has
wished
that
the
story
of
the
black
soldiers
should
be
told
to
the
world
the
interest
of
the
commanding
general
of
the
army
is
shown
in
his
letter
thus
encouraged
from
official
sources
and
receiving
the
most
hearty
words
of
cheer
from
friends
of
whom
none
has
been
more
potent
or
more
earnest
than
bishop
arnett
of
the
african
church
i
have
after
five
months
of
severe
labor
about
completed
my
task
so
far
as
i
find
it
in
my
power
to
complete
it
and
trusting
that
the
majesty
and
interest
of
the
story
itself
will
atone
for
any
defects
in
the
style
of
the
narration
the
volume
is
now
offered
to
a
sympathetic
public
affectionately
dedicated
to
the
men
whose
heroic
services
have
furnished

wilberforce
ohio
dear
sir
your
letter
of
the
ultimo
was
duly
received
but
my
time
has
been
so
much
engrossed
with
official
duties
requiring
my
presence
part
of
the
time
out
of
the
city
that
it
has
not
been
practicable
to
comply
with
your
request
earlier
and
even
now
i
can
only
reply
very
briefly
you
will
remember
that
my
acquaintance
with
negro
character
commenced
during
the
civil
war
the
colored
race
then
presented
itself
to
me
in
the
character
of
numerous
contrabands
of
war
and
as
a
people
who
individually
yearned
for
the
light
and
life
of
liberty
ages
of
slavery
had
reduced
them
to
the
lowest
ebb
of
manhood
from
that
degree
of
degradation
i
have
been
an
interested
spectator
of
the
marvelously
rapid
evolution
of
the
race
from
the
commencement
of
this
evolution
to
the
present
time
i
have
been
more
or
less
in
a
position
to
closely
observe
their
progress
at
the
close
of
the
war
i
was
in
command
of
one
of
the
very
important
military
districts
of
the
south
and
my
concern
for
the
welfare
of
all
the
people
of
that
district
not
excluding
the
people
of
color
you
will
find
evidenced
in
the
measures
taken
by
me
more
especially
in
regard
to
educational
matters
at
that
time
the
first
regiment
which
i
commanded
on
entering
the
regular
army
of
the
united
states
at
the
close
of
the
war
was
made
up
of
colored
troops
that
regiment
the
infantry
achieved
a
reputation
for
military
conduct
which
forms
a
record
that
may
be
favorably
compared
with
the
best
regiments
in
the
service
then
again
refer
to
my
general
order
no
issued
after
the
fall
of
santiago
and
you
will
see
that
recognition
is
not
grudgingly
given
to
the
troops
who
heroically
fought
there
whether
of
american
of
african
or
of
latin
descent
if
so
early
in
the
second
generation
of
the
existence
of
the
race
in
the
glorious
light
of
liberty
it
produces
such
orators
as
douglas
such
educators
as
booker
washington
such
divines
as
the
bishops
what
may
we
not
expect
of
the
race
when
it
shall
have
experienced
as
many
generations
of
growth
and
development
as
the
who
now
dominate
the
thought
the
inventive
genius
the
military
prowess
and
the
commercial
enterprise
of
the
world
very
truly

features
of

character
both
important
and
instructive
are
hereby
announced
to
the
army
the
declaration
of
war
found
our
country
with
a
small
army
scattered
over
a
vast
territory
the
troops
composing
this
army
were
speedily
mobilized
at
tampa
before
it
was
possible
to
properly
equip
a
volunteer
force
strong
appeals
for
aid
came
from
the
navy
which
had
inclosed
in
the
harbor
of
santiago
de
cuba
an
important
part
of
the
spanish
fleet
at
that
time
the
only
efficient
fighting
force
available
was
the
united
states
army
and
in
order
to
organize
a
command
of
sufficient
strength
the
cavalry
had
to
be
sent
dismounted
to
santiago
de
cuba
with
the
infantry
and
artillery
the
expedition
thus
formed
was
placed
under
command
of
shafter
notwithstanding
the
limited
time
to
equip
and
organize
an
expedition
of
this
character
there
was
never
displayed
a
nobler
spirit
of
patriotism
and
fortitude
on
the
part
of
officers
and
men
going
forth
to
mantain
the
honor
of
their
country
after
encountering
the
vicissitudes
of
an
ocean
voyage
they
were
obliged
to
disembark
on
a
foreign
shore
and
immediately
engage
in
an
aggressive
campaign
under
drenching
storms
intense
and
prostrating
heat
within
a
district
with
little
comfort
or
rest
either
by
day
or
night
they
pursued
their
purpose
of
finding
and
conquering
the
enemy
many
of
them
trained
in
the
severe
experience
of
the
great
war
and
in
frequent
campaigns
on
the
western
plains
officers
and
men
alike
exhibited
a
great
skill
fortitude
and
tenacity
with
results
which
have
added
a
new
chapter
of
glory
to
their
country
history
even
when
their
own
generals
in
several
cases
were
temporarily
disabled
the
troops
fought
on
with
the
same
heroic
spirit
until
success
was
finally
achieved
in
many
instances
the
officers
placed
themselves
in
front
of
their
commands
and
under
their
direct
and
skillful
leadership
the
trained
troops
of
a
brave
army
were
driven
from
the
thickets
and
jungles
of
an
almost
inaccessible
country
in
the
open
field
the
troops
stormed
intrenched
infantry
and
carried
and
captured
fortified
works
with
an
unsurpassed
daring
and
disregard
of
death
by
gaining
commanding
ground
they
made
the
harbor
of
santiago
untenable
for
the
spanish
fleet
and
practically
drove
it
out
to
a
speedy
destruction
by
the
american
navy
while
enduring
the
hardships
and
privations
of
such
campaign
the
troops
generously
shared
their
scanty
food
with
the
cuban
patriots
in
arms
and
the
suffering
people
who
had
fled
from
the
besieged
city
with
the
regiments
and
four
batteries
the
flower
of
the
united
states
army
were
also
three
volunteer
regiments
these
though
unskilled
in
warfare
yet
inspired
with
the
same
spirit
contributed
to
the
victory
suffered
hardships
and
made
sacrifices
with
the
rest
where
all
did
so
well
it
is
impossible
by
special
mention
to
do
justice
to
those
who
bore
conspicuous
part
but
of
certain
unusual
features
mention
can
not
be
omitted
namely
the
cavalry
dismounted
fighting
and
storming
works
as
infantry
and
a
regiment
of
colored
troops
who
having
shared
equally
in
the
heroism
as
well
as
the
sacrifices
is
now
voluntarily
engaged
in
nursing
patients
and
burying
the
dead
the
gallantry
patriotism
and
sacrifices
of
the
american
army
as
illustrated
in
this
brief
campaign
will
be
fully
appreciated
by
a
grateful
country
and
the
heroic
deeds
of
those
who
have
fought
and
fallen
in
the
cause
of
freedom
will
ever
be
cherished
in
sacred
memory
and
be
an
inspiration
to
the
living
by
command
of
miles
gilmore
united
states
volunteers
introductory
to
write
the
history
of
the
negro
race
within
that
part
of
the
western
world
known
as
the
united
states
of
america
would
be
a
task
to
which
one
might
devote
a
life
time
and
still
fail
in
its
satisfactory
accomplishment
the
difficulties
lying
in
the
way
of
collecting
and
unifying
the
material
are
very
great
and
that
of
detecting
the
inner
life
of
the
people
much
greater
facts
and
dates
are
to
history
what
color
and
proportion
are
to
the
painting
employed
by
genius
color
and
form
combine
in
a
language
that
speaks
to
the
soul
giving
pleasure
and
instruction
to
the
beholder
so
the
facts
and
dates
occurring
along
the
pathway
of
a
people
when
gathered
and
arranged
by
labor
and
care
assume
a
voice
and
a
power
which
they
have
not
otherwise
as
these
facts
express
the
thoughts
and
feelings
and
the
growth
of
a
people
they
become
the
language
in
which
that
people
writes
its
history
and
the
work
of
the
historian
is
to
read
and
interpret
this
history
for
the
benefit
of
his
fellow
men
borrowing
a
second
illustration
from
the
work
of
the
artist
it
may
be
said
that
as
nature
reveals
her
secrets
only
to
him
whose
soul
is
in
deepest
sympathy
with
her
moods
and
movements
so
a
people
history
can
be
discovered
only
by
one
whose
heart
throbs
in
unison
with
those
who
have
made
the
history
to
write
the
history
of
any
people
successfully
one
must
read
it
by
the
heart
and
the
best
part
of
history
like
the
best
part
of
the
picture
must
ever
remain
unexpressed
the
artist
sees
more
and
feels
more
than
he
is
able
to
transfer
to
his
canvas
however
entrancing
his
presentation
and
the
historian
sees
and
feels
more
than
his
brightest
pages
convey
to
his
readers
nothing
less
than
a
profound
respect
and
love
for
humankind
and
a
special
attraction
toward
a
particular
people
and
age
can
fit
one
to
engage
in
so
sublime
a
task
as
that
of
translating
the
history
of
a
people
into
the
language
of
common
men
the
history
of
the
american
negro
differs
very
widely
from
that
of
any
people
whose
has
been
told
and
when
it
shall
come
to
be
known
and
studied
will
open
an
entirely
new
view
of
experience
in
it
we
shall
be
able
to
see
what
has
never
before
been
discovered
in
history
to
wit
the
absolute
beginning
of
a
people
brought
to
these
shores
by
the
as
freight
and
sold
as
merchandise
entirely
broken
away
from
the
tribes
races
or
nations
of
their
native
land
recognized
only
as
african
slaves
and
forbidden
all
movement
looking
toward
organic
life
deprived
of
even
the
right
of
family
or
of
marriage
and
corrupted
in
the
most
shameless
manner
by
their
powerful
and
licentious
oppressors
it
is
from
this
heterogeneous
protoplasm
that
the
american
negro
has
been
developed
the
foundation
from
which
he
sprang
had
been
laid
by
piecemeal
as
the
slave
ships
made
their
annual
deposits
of
cargoes
brought
from
different
points
on
the
west
coast
and
basely
corrupted
as
is
only
too
well
known
yet
out
of
it
has
grown
within
less
than
three
hundred
years
an
organic
people
grandfathers
and
are
among
them
and
personal
acquaintance
is
exceedingly
wide
in
the
face
of
slavery
and
against
its
teaching
and
its
power
overcoming
the
seduction
of
the
master
class
and
the
coarse
and
brutal
corruptions
of
the
baser
overseer
class
the
african
slave
persistently
strove
to
clothe
himself
with
the
habiliments
of
civilization
and
so
prepared
himself
for
social
organization
that
as
soon
as
the
hindrances
were
removed
this
vast
people
almost
immediately
set
themselves
in
families
and
for
over
thirty
years
they
have
been
busily
engaged
hunting
up
the
lost
roots
of
their
family
trees
we
know
the
pit
whence
the
race
was
dug
the
rock
whence
he
was
hewn
he
was
born
here
on
this
soil
from
a
people
who
in
the
classic
language
of
the
hebrew
prophet
could
be
described
as
no
people
that
there
has
been
a
majestic
evolution
quietly
but
rapidly
going
on
in
this
mass
growing
as
it
was
both
by
natural
development
and
by
accretion
is
plainly
evident
heterogeneous
as
were
the
fragments
by
the
aid
of
a
common
language
and
a
common
lot
and
cruel
yet
partially
civilizing
control
the
whole
people
were
forced
into
a
common
outward
form
and
to
a
remarkable
extent
into
the
same
ways
of
thinking
the
affinities
within
were
really
aided
by
the
repulsions
without
and
when
finally
freed
from
slavery
for
an
ignorant
and
inexperienced
people
they
presented
an
astonishing
spectacle
of
unity
socially
politically
and
religiously
their
power
to
work
together
showed
itself
little
less
than
marvellous
the
developing
from
this
slave
base
now
directs
great
organizations
of
a
religious
character
and
in
comprehensive
sweep
invites
to
his
the
inhabitants
of
the
isles
of
the
sea
and
of
africa
he
is
joining
with
the
primitive
strong
hopeful
and
expanding
races
of
southern
africa
and
is
evidently
preparing
for
a
day
that
has
not
yet
come
the
progress
made
thus
far
by
the
people
is
somewhat
like
that
made
by
the
young
man
who
hires
himself
to
a
farmer
and
takes
his
pay
in
farming
stock
and
utensils
he
is
thus
acquiring
the
means
to
stock
a
farm
and
the
skill
and
experience
necessary
to
its
successful
management
at
the
same
time
his
career
will
not
appear
important
however
until
the
day
shall
arrive
when
he
will
set
up
for
himself
the
time
spent
on
the
farm
of
another
was
passed
in
comparative
obscurity
but
without
it
the
more
conspicuous
period
could
never
have
followed
so
now
the
american
colored
people
are
making
history
but
it
is
not
of
that
kind
that
gains
the
attention
of
writers
having
no
political
organizations
governments
or
armies
they
are
not
performing
those
deeds
of
splendor
in
statesmanship
and
war
over
which
the
pen
of
the
historian
usually
delights
to
linger
the
people
living
growing
reading
thinking
working
suffering
advancing
and
dying
these
are
all
occurrences
neither
warming
the
heart
of
the
observer
nor
capable
of
brightening

this
however
is
with
the
insignificant
exception
of
liberia
all
that
is
yet
to
be
found
in
the
brief
history
of
the
race
the
period
for
him
to
set
up
for
himself
has
not
yet
come
and
he
is
still
acquiring
means
and
training
within
a
realm
controlled
in
all
respects
by
a
people
who
maintain
toward
him
an
attitude
of
absolute
social
exclusion
his
is
the
history
of
a
people
marching
from
nowhere
to
somewhere
but
with
no
canaan
before
them
and
no
moses
to
lead
it
is
indeed
on
their
part
a
walk
by
faith
for
as
yet
the
wisest
among
the
race
can
not
tell
even
the
direction
of
the
journey
before
us
lie
surely
three
possible
destinies
if
not
four
yet
it
is
not
clear
toward
which
one
of
these
we
are
marching
are
we
destined
to
see
the
african
element
of
america
population
blend
with
the
element
and
be
lost
in
a
common
people
will
the
colored
american
leave
this
home
in
which
as
a
race
he
has
been
born
and
reared
to
manhood
and
find
his
stage
of
action
somewhere
else
on
god
earth
will
he
remain
here
as
a
separate
and
subordinate
people
perpetuating
the
conditions
of
only
that
they
may
become
more
humiliating
and
exasperating
or
is
there
to
arise
a
war
of
races
in
which
the
blacks
are
to
be
exterminated
who
knows
fortunately
the
historian
is
not
called
upon
to
perform
the
duties
of
prophet
his
work
is
to
tell
what
has
been
and
if
others
building
upon
his
presentation
of
facts
can
deduce
what
is
to
be
it
is
no
small
tribute
to
the
correctness
of
his
interpretations
for
all
events
are
parts
of
one
vast
system
ever
moving
toward
some
great
end
one
remark
only
need
be
made
it
is
reasonable
to
presume
that
this
new
will
somehow
and
somewhere
be
given
an
opportunity
to
express
that
particular
modification
of
material
life
which
his
spiritual
nature
will
demand
whether
that
expression
will
be
made
here
or
elsewhere
whether
it
will
be
higher
or
lower
than
what
now
surrounds
us
are
questions
which
we
may
well
leave
to
the
future
no
people
can
win
and
hold
a
place
either
as
a
nation
among
other
nations
or
as
an
elementary
component
of
a
nation
merely
by
its
own
goodness
or
by
the
goodness
of
others
the
struggle
for
national
existence
is
a
familiar
one
and
is
always
initiated
by
a
display
of
physical
force
those
who
have
the
power
seize
territory
and
government
and
those
who
can
keep
possession
and
control
it
is
in
some
instances
the
backing
up
of
right
by
might
and
in
others
the
substituting
of
right
by
might
too
often
the
greatest
of
all
national
crimes
is
to
be
weak
when
the
struggle
is
a
quiet
one
going
on
within
a
nation
and
is
that
of
an
element
seeking
a
place
in
the
common
social
life
of
the
country
much
the
same
principles
are
involved
it
is
still
a
question
to
be
settled
by
force
no
matter
how
highly
the
claim
of
the
weaker
may
be
favored
by
reason
and
justice
the
powers
by
which
a
special
people
may
emerge
from
an
unhappy
condition
and
secure
improved
social
relations
using
the
word
social
in
its
broadest
sense
are
physical
intellectual
and
material
there
must
be
developed
manly
strength
and
courage
and
a
power
of
intellect
which
will
manifest
itself
in
organization
and
attractiveness
and
in
the
aptitude
of
employing
appropriate
methods
for
ends
in
view
to
these
must
be
added
the
power
that
comes
through
wealth
and
thus
with
the
real
advancement
of
condition
and
character
will
come
tardily
and
grudgingly
perhaps
but
nevertheless
surely
improved
social
standing
once
filled
with
the
common
national
spirit
partaking
of
its
thoughts
entering
heartily
into
the
common
movements
having
the
same
dress
language
and
manners
as
others
and
being
as
able
and
as
willing
to
help
as
to
be
helped
and
withal
being
in
fact
the
most
intensely
american
element
on
the
continent
because
constructed
on
this
soil
we
may
hope
that
the
will
ultimately
win
and
hold
his
proper
place
the
history
made
by
the
american
negro
has
been
so
filled
with
suffering
that
we
have
overlooked
the
active
side
the
world
has
heard
so
much
of
the
horrors
of
the
middle
passage
the
awful
sufferings
of
the
slave
the
barbarous
outrages
that
have
been
perpetrated
upon
the
inhuman
and
senseless
prejudices
that
meet
colored
americans
almost
everywhere
on
their
native
soil
that
it
has
come
to
look
upon
this
recital
as
the
whole
of
the
story
it
needs
to
be
told
that
these
records
constitute
the
dark
side
of
the
picture
dark
and
horrible
enough
to
be
sure
but
this
is
by
no
means
the
whole
picture
if
there
are
scenes
whose
representations
would
serve
to
ornament
the
infernal
regions
pictures
over
which
fiends
might
gloat
there
are
also
others
which
angels
might
delight
to
gaze
upon
there
has
been
much
of
worthy
action
among
the
colored
people
of
this
country
wherever
the
bonds
of
oppression
have
been
slackened
enough
to
allow
of
free
movement
there
have
been
resistance
to
wrong
by
way
of
remonstrance
and
petition
sometimes
even
by
force
laudable
efforts
toward
benevolent
and
philanthropic
movements
reform
organizations
and
commendable
business
enterprise
both
in
individuals
and
associations
these
show
a
toughness
of
fibre
and
steadiness
of
purpose
sufficient
to
make
the
backbone
of
a
real
history
the
present
work
deals
with
these
elements
of
character
as
they
are
exhibited
in
the
garb
of
the
soldier
when
men
are
willing
to
fight
and
die
for
what
they
hold
dear
they
have
become
a
moving
force
capable
of
disturbing
the
currents
of
history
and
of
making
a
channel
for
the
stream
of
their
own
actions
the
american
negro
has
evolved
an
active
aggressive
element
in
the
scientific
fighting
men
he
has
produced
individual
pugilists
of
that
race
have
entered
all
classes
from
featherweight
to
heavyweight
and
have
remained
there
receiving
blows
and
dealing
blows
showing
a
sturdy
positive
force
mastering
and
employing
all
the
methods
of
attack
and
defence
allowed
in
such
encounters
and
supporting
themselves
with
that
fortitude
and
courage
so
necessary
to
the
ring
such
combats
are
not
to
be
commended
as
they
are
usually
mere
tests
of
skill
and
endurance
entered
into
on
the
principles
of
the
gambler
and
they
are
introduced
here
for
the
sole
purpose
of
showing
the
colored
man
as
a
positive
force
yielding
only
to
a
superior
degree
of
force
of
the
same
kind
the
soldier
stands
for
something
far
higher
than
the
pugilist
represents
although
he
has
need
of
the
same
qualities
of
physical
hardihood
contempt
for
suffering
and
coolness
in
the
presence
of
danger
united
with
skill
in
the
use
of
his
weapons
the
pugilist
is
his
own
general
and
never
learns
the
high
lessons
of
obedience
the
soldier
learns
to
subordinate
himself
to
his
commander
and
to
fight
bravely
and
effectively
under
the
direction
of
another
the
evolution
of
the
soldier
was
the
work
of
a
short
period
and
suffered
many
interruptions
when
the
war
of
the
revolution
broke
out
the
colored
man
was
a
slave
knowing
nothing
of
the
spirit
or
the
training
of
the
soldier
before
it
closed
several
thousand
colored
men
had
entered
the
army
and
some
had
won
distinction
for
gallantry
less
than
forty
years
later
in
the
war
of
the
black
man
again
appeared
to
take
his
stand
under
the
flag
of
independence
the
war
of
secession
again
witnessed
the
coming
forth
of
the
black
soldier
this
time
in
important
numbers
and
performing
heroic
services
on
a
grand
scale
and
under
most
discouraging
circumstances
but
with
such
success
that
he
won
a
place
in
arms
for
all
time
when
the
civil
war
closed
the
american
black
man
had
secured
his
standing
as
a
soldier
the
evolution
was
complete
henceforth
he
was
to
be
found
an
integral
part
of
the
army
of
the
united
states
the
black
man
passed
through
the
trying
baptism
of
fire
in
the
sixties
and
came
out
of
it
a
soldier
his
was
worse
than
an
impartial
trial
it
was
a
trial
before
a
jury
strongly
biased
against
him
in
the
service
of
a
government
willing
to
allow
him
but
half
pay
and
in
the
face
of
a
foe
denying
him
the
rights
belonging
to
civilized
warfare
yet
against
these
odds
denied
the
dearest
right
of
a
soldier
the
hope
of
promotion
scorned
by
his
companions
in
arms
the
negro
on
more
than
two
hundred
and
fifty
demonstrated
his
courage
and
skill
and
wrung
from
the
american
nation
the
right
to
bear
arms
the
barons
were
no
more
successful
in
their
struggle
with
king
john
when
they
obtained
magna
charta
than
were
the
american
negroes
with
prejudice
when
they
secured
the
national
recognition
of
their
right
and
fitness
to
hold
a
place
in
the
standing
army
of
the
united
states
the
soldier
now
takes
his
rank
with
america
best
and
in
appearance
skill
physique
manners
conduct
and
courage
proves
himself
worthy
of
the
position
he
holds
combining
in
his
person
the
harvested
influences
of
three
great
continents
europe
africa
and
america
he
stands
up
as
the
typical
soldier
of
the
western
world
the
latest
comer
in
the
field
of
arms
but
yielding
his
place
in
the
line
to
none
and
ever
ready
to
defend
his
country
and
his
flag
against
any
and
all
foes
the
mission
of
this
book
is
to
make
clear
this
evolution
giving
the
historical
facts
with
as
much
detail
as
possible
and
setting
forth
finally
the
portrait
of
this
new
soldier
that
this
is
a
prodigious
task
is
too
evident
to
need
assertion
a
task
worthy
the
most
lofty
talents
and
in
essaying
it
i
humbly
confess
to
a
sense
of
unfitness
yet
the
work
lies
before
me
and
duty
orders
me
to
enter
upon
it

major
general
writes
i
wish
you
every
success
in
producing
a
work
important
both
historically
and
for
the
credit
of
a
race
far
more
deserving
than
the
world

acknowledged

says
to
me
most
encouragingly
you
must
allow
me
for
our
intimate
associations
justify
it
to
write
frankly
your
education
habits
of
thought
fairness
of
judgment
and
comprehension
of
the
work
you
are
to
undertake
better
fit
you
for
writing
such
a
history
than
any
person
within
my
acquaintance
those
noble
men
made
the
history
at
el
caney
and
san
juan
i
believe
you
are
the
man
to
record
it
may
god
help
you
to
so
set
forth
the
deeds
of
that
memorable
first
of

offered
by

heartily
echo

only
wish
that
in
it
all
my
friends
might
join
and
that

would
answer
it

power
to
do
the
work
in
such
a
way

to
bring
great

notes
professor
dubois
in
his
exhaustive
work
upon
the
suppression
of
the
african
has
brought
within
comparatively
narrow
limits
the
great
mass
of
facts
bearing
upon
his
subject
and
in
synopses
and
indices
has
presented
all
of
the
more
important
literature
it
has
induced
in
his
monograph
published
as
volume
ii
of
the
harvard
historical
series
he
has
traced
the
rise
of
this
nefarious
traffic
especially
with
reference
to
the
american
colonies
exhibited
the
proportions
to
which
it
expanded
and
the
tenacity
with
which
it
held
on
to
its
purpose
until
it
met
its
death
in
the
fate
of

every
step
in
his
narrative
is
supported
by
references
to
unimpeachable
authorities
and
the
scholarly
monograph
bears
high
testimony
to
the
author
earnest
labor
painstaking
research
and
unswerving
fidelity
should
the
present
work
stimulate
inquiry
beyond
the
scope
herein
set
before
the
reader
he
is
most
confidently
referred
to
professor
du
bois
book
as
containing
a
complete
exposition
of
the
development
and
overthrow
of
that
awful
crime
it
is
from
this
work
however
that
we
shall
obtain
a
nearer
and
clearer
view
of
the
african
planted
upon
our
shores
negro
slavery
began
at
an
early
day
in
the
north
american
colonies
but
up
until
the
revolution
of
the
demand
for
slaves
was
mainly
supplied
from
england
the
slaves
being
white
it
is
probable
says
professor
dubois
that
about
slaves
were
brought
to
america
each
year
between
and
and
after
it
rose
to
perhaps
annually
before
the
revolution
the
total
exportation
to
america
is
variously
estimated
as
between
and
each
year
something
of
the
horrors
of
the
middle
passage
may
be
shown
by
the
records
that
out
of
slaves
shipped
from
africa
during
the
years
or
nearly
of
the
entire
number
perished
at
sea
in
there
were
in
the
country
nearly
seven
hundred
thousand
africans
these
having
been
introduced
by
installments
from
various
heathen
tribes
the
importation
of
slaves
continued
with
more
or
less
success
up
until
when
the
wanderer
landed
her
cargo
of
in
georgia
during
the
period
from
to
the
breaking
out
of
the
civil
war
shortly
after
the
landing
of
the
last
cargo
of
slaves
the
colored
population
both
slave
and
free
had
arisen
to
about
four
million
and
had
undergone
great
modifications
the
cargo
of
the
wanderer
found
themselves
among
strangers
even
when
trying
to
associate
with
those
who
in
color
and
hair
were
like
themselves
the
slaves
of
differed
greatly
from
the
slaves
of
a
hundred
years
earlier
they
had
lost
the
relics
of
that
stern
warlike
spirit
which
prompted
the
stono
insurrection
the
denmark
vesey
insurrection
and
the
nat
turner
insurrection
and
had
accepted
their
lot
as
slaves
hoping
that
through
god
freedom
would
come
to
them
some
time
in
the
happy
future
large
numbers
of
them
had
become
christians
through
the
teaching
of
godly
white
women
and
at
length
through
the
evangelistic
efforts
of
men
and
women
of
their
own
race
independent
religious
organizations
had
been
formed
in
the
north
and
large
local
churches
with
negro
pastors
were
in
existence
in
the
south
when
the
wanderer
landed
her
cargo
there
had
been
a
steady
increase
in
numbers
indicating
that
the
physical
of
the
slave
was
not
overlooked
and
the
slaves
had
greatly
improved
in
character
sales
made
in
south
carolina
between
and

boys
from
to
years
of

showing
an
average

a
sale
of

reported
in

in
which
the

says

also
that

likely

servants
one

the
other

these
cases
are
presented
to
illustrate
the
financial
value
of
the
american
slave
and
inferentially
the
progress
he
had
made
in
acquiring
the
arts
of
modern
civilization
slaves
had
become
blacksmiths
wheelwrights
carpenters
bricklayers
tailors
bootmakers
founders
and
moulders
not
to
mention
all
the
common
labor
performed
by
them
slave
women
had
become
dressmakers
hairdressers
nurses
and
the
best
cooks
to
be
found
in
the
world
the
regarded
themselves
as
the
favored
of
mankind
because
of
the
competence
and
faithfulness
of
their
slaves
the
african
spirit
and
character
had
disappeared
and
in
their
place
were
coming
into
being
the
elements
of
a
new
character
existing
in
purely
in
a
negative
form
the
slave
had
become
an
american
he
was
now
a
civilized
slave
and
had
received
his
civilization
from
his
masters
he
had
separated
himself
very
far
from
his
brother
slave
in
domingo
the
haytian
negro
fought
and
won
his
freedom
before
he
had
been
civilized
in
slavery
and
hence
has
never
passed
over
the
same
ground
that
his
american
has
been
compelled
to
traverse
beside
the
slaves
in
the
south
there
were
also
several
thousand
free
persons
of
color
as
they
were
called
dwelling
in
such
cities
as
richmond
charleston
and
new
orleans
la
some
of
these
had
become
quite
wealthy
and
forming
a
distinct
class
of
the
population
they
were
called
creoles
in
louisiana
and
were
accorded
certain
privileges
although
laws
were
carefully
enacted
to
keep
alive
the
distinction
between
them
and
the
whites
in
charleston
the
colored
people
set
themselves
up
as
a
class
prided
themselves
much
upon
their
color
and
hair
and
in
their
sympathies
joined
almost
wholly
with
the
master
class
representatives
of
their
class
became
and
were
in
full
accord
with
the
social
policy
of
the
country
nevertheless
their
presence
was
an
encouragement
to
the
slave
and
consequently
was
objected
to
by
the
the
free
colored
man
became
more
and
more
disliked
in
the
south
as
the
slave
became
more
civilized
he
was
supposed
by
his
example
to
contribute
to
the
discontent
of
the
slave
and
laws
were
passed
restricting
his
priveleges
so
as
to
induce
him
to
leave
between
and
this
question
reached
a
crisis
and
free
colored
people
from
the
south
were
to
be
seen
taking
up
their
homes
in
the
northern
states
and
in
canada
many
of
the
people
especially
from
charleston
carried
with
them
all
their
belittling
prejudices
and
after
years
of
sojourn
under
the
sway
of
enlightened
and
liberal
ideas
proved
themselves
still
incapable
of
learning
the
new
way
or
forgetting
the
old
there
were
then
three
very
distinct
classes
of
colored
people
in
the
country
to
wit
the
slave
in
the
south
the
free
colored
people
of
the
south
and
the
free
colored
people
of
the
north
these
were
also
into
several
smaller
classes
slaves
were
divided
into
field
hands
house
servants
and
city
slaves
the
free
colored
people
of
the
south
had
their
classes
based
usually
on
color
the
free
colored
people
of
the
north
had
their
divisions
caused
by
differences
in
religion
differences
as
to
place
of
birth
and
numerous
family
conceits
so
that
surveyed
as
a
whole
it
is
extremely
difficult
to
get
anything
like
a
complete
social
map
of
these
four
millions
as
they
existed
at
the
outbreak
of
the
civil
war
for
a
quarter
of
a
century
there
had
been
a
steady
concentration
of
the
slave
population
within
the
cotton
and
region
the
states
of
delaware
maryland
and
virginia
having
become
to
a
considerable
extent
breeding
farms
particularly
was
this
the
case
with
the
more
intelligent
and
higher
developed
individual
slaves
who
appeared
near
the
border
line
the
master
felt
that
such
persons
would
soon
make
their
escape
by
way
of
the
underground
railroad
or
otherwise
and
hence
in
order
to
prevent
a
total
loss
would
follow
the
dictates
of
business
prudence
and
sell
his
bright
slave
man
to
georgia
the
maryland
or
virginia
slave
who
showed
suspicious
aspirations
was
usually
checked
by
the
threat
i
sell
you
to
georgia
and
if
the
threat
did
not
produce
the
desired
reformation
it
was
not
long
before
the
ambitious
slave
found
himself
in
the
gang
of
that
most
despised
and
most
despicable
of
all
creatures
the
georgia
georgia
and
canada
were
the
two
extremes
of
the
anticipation
during
the
last
decade
of
his
experience
these
stood
as
his
earthly
heaven
and
hell
the
underground
railroad
with
its
agents
conducting
to
one
and
the
odious
driving
men
women
and
children
to
the
other
no
netherlander
ever
hated
and
feared
the
devil
more
thoroughly
than
did
the
slaves
of
the
border
states
hate
and
fear
these
outrages
on
mankind
the
kidnapping
of
the
cotton
and
cane
regions
i
say
kidnapping
for
i
have
myself
seen
persons
in
georgia
who
had
been
kidnapped
in
maryland
if
the
devil
was
ever
incarnate
i
think
it
safe
to
look
for
him
among
those
who
engaged
in
the
whether
in
a
foreign
or
domestic
form
nothing
is
more
striking
in
connection
with
the
history
of
american
slavery
than
the
conduct
of
great
britain
on
the
same
subject
so
inconsistent
has
this
conduct
been
that
it
can
be
explained
only
by
regarding
england
as
a
conglomerate
of
two
elements
nearly
equal
in
strength
of
directly
opposite
character
ruling
alternately
the
affairs
of
the
nation
as
a
and
england
was
perhaps
even
worse
than
the
united
states
under
her
rule
the
slave
decreased
in
numbers
and
remained
a
savage
in
jamaica
in
vincent
in
british
guiana
in
barbadoes
in
trinidad
and
in
grenada
british
slavery
was
far
worse
than
american
slavery
in
these
colonies
the
slave
was
generally
a
barbarian
speaking
an
unknown
tongue
and
working
with
men
like
himself
in
gangs
with
scarcely
a
chance
for
improvement
an
economist
says
had
the
slaves
of
the
british
colonies
been
as
well
fed
clothed
lodged
and
otherwise
cared
for
as
were
those
of
the
united
states
their
number
at
emancipation
would
have
reached
from
seventeen
to
twenty
millions
whereas
the
actual
number
emancipated
was
only
had
the
blacks
of
the
united
states
experienced
the
same
treatment
as
did
those
of
the
british
colonies
would
have
found
among
us
less
than
colored
persons
in
the
united
states
were
found
ten
colored
persons
for
every
slave
imported
while
in
the
british
colonies
only
one
was
found
for
every
three
imported
hence
the
claim
that
the
american
negro
is
a
new
race
built
up
on
this
soil
rests
upon
an
ample
supply
of
facts
the
american
slave
was
born
in
our
civilization
fed
upon
good
american
food
housed
and
clothed
on
a
civilized
plan
taught
the
arts
and
language
of
civilization
acquired
necessarily
ideas
of
law
and
liberty
and
by
was
well
on
the
road
toward
fitness
for
freedom
no
lessons
therefore
drawn
from
the
emancipation
of
british
slaves
in
the
west
indies
are
of
any
direct
value
to
us
inasmuch
as
british
slavery
was
not
like
american
slavery
the
british
freedman
was
in
no
sense
the
equal
of
the
american
freedman
and
the
circumstances
surrounding
the
emancipation
of
the
british
slave
had
nothing
of
the
inspiring
and
ennobling
character
with
those
connected
with
the
breaking
of
the
american
negro
chains
yet
superior
as
the
american
negro
was
as
a
slave
he
was
very
far
below
the
standard
of
american
citizenship
as
subsequent
events
conclusively
proved
the
best
form
of
slavery
even
though
it
may
lead
toward
fitness
for
freedom
can
never
be
regarded
as
a
fit
school
in
which
to
graduate
citizens
of
so
magnificent
an
empire
as
the
united
states
the
slave
of
was
perhaps
all
things
considered
the
best
slave
the
world
had
ever
seen
if
we
except
those
who
served
the
hebrews
under
the
mosaic
statutes
while
there
was
no
such
thing
among
them
as
legal
marriage
or
legitimate
childhood
yet
slave
families
were
recognized
even
on
the
auction
block
and
after
emancipation
legal
family
life
was
erected
generally
upon
relationships
which
had
been
formed
in
slavery
bishop
gaines
himself
born
a
slave
of
slave
parents
says
the
negro
had
no
civil
rights
under
the
codes
of
the
southern
states
it
was
often
the
case
it
is
true
that
the
marriage
ceremony
was
performed
and
thousands
of
couples
regarded
it
and
observed
it
as
of
binding
force
and
were
as
true
to
each
other
as
if
they
had
been
lawfully
married
the
colored
people
generally
he
says
held
their
marriage
if
such
unauthorized
union
may
be
called
marriage
sacred
even
while
they
were
slaves
many
instances
will
be
recalled
by
the
older
people
of
the
fidelity
which
existed
between
the
slave
and
his
concubine
wife
the
mother
of
his
children
my
own
father
and
mother
lived
together
over
sixty
years
i
am
the
fourteenth
child
of
that
union
and
i
can
truthfully
affirm
that
no
marriage
however
made
sacred
by
the
sanction
of
law
was
ever
more
congenial
and
beautiful
thousands
of
like
instances
might
be
cited
to
the
same
effect
it
will
always
be
to
the
credit
of
the
colored
people
that
almost
without
exception
they
adhered
to
their
relations
illegal
though
they
had
been
and
accepted
gladly
the
new
law
which
put
the
stamp
of
legitimacy
upon
their
union
and
removed
the
brand
of
bastardy
from
the
brows
of
their
children
let
us
now
sum
up
the
qualifications
that
these
people
possessed
in
large
degree
in
order
to
determine
their
fitness
for
freedom
then
so
near
at
hand
they
had
acquired
the
english
language
and
the
christian
religion
including
the
christian
idea
of
marriage
so
entirely
different
in
spirit
and
form
from
the
african
marriage
they
had
acquired
the
civilized
methods
of
cooking
their
food
making
and
wearing
clothes
sleeping
in
beds
and
observing
sunday
they
had
acquired
many
of
the
useful
arts
and
trades
of
civilization
and
had
imbibed
the
tastes
and
feelings
to
some
extent
at
least
of
the
country
in
which
they
lived
becoming
keen
observers
shut
out
from
books
and
newspapers
they
listened
attentively
learned
more
of
law
and
politics
than
was
generally
supposed
they
knew
what
the
election
of
meant
and
were
on
tiptoe
with
expectation
although
the
days
of
insurrection
had
passed
and
the
slave
of
was
not
ready
to
rise
with
the
immortal
john
brown
he
had
not
lost
his
desire
for
freedom
the
steady
march
of
escaping
slaves
guided
by
the
north
star
with
the
refrain
i
on
my
way
to
canada
that
cold
but
happy
land
the
dire
effects
of
slavery
i
can
no
longer
stand
proved
that
the
desire
to
be
free
was
becoming
more
extensive
and
absorbing
as
the
slave
advanced
in
intelligence
it
is
necessary
again
to
emphasize
the
fact
that
the
american
slaves
were
well
formed
and
well
developed
physically
capable
of
enduring
hard
labor
and
of
subsisting
upon
the
plainest
food
their
diet
for
years
had
been
of
the
simplest
sort
and
they
had
been
subjected
to
a
system
of
regulations
very
much
like
those
which
are
employed
in
the
management
of
armies
they
had
an
hour
to
go
to
bed
and
an
hour
to
rise
left
their
homes
only
upon
written
passes
and
when
abroad
at
night
were
often
halted
by
the
wandering
patrol
run
nigger
run
the
patrol
get
you
was
a
song
of
the
slave
children
of
south
carolina
strangers
who
saw
for
the
first
time
these
people
as
they
came
out
of
slavery
in
were
usually
impressed
with
their
robust
appearance
and
a
conference
of
assembled
soon
after
the
war
introduced
a
resolution
with
the
following
declaration
whereas
slavery
has
left
us
in
possession
of
strong
and
healthy
bodies
it
is
probable
that
at
least
a
of
men
of
proper
age
could
then
have
been
found
among
the
newly
liberated
capable
of
bearing
arms
they
were
inured
to
the
plain
ration
to
labor
and
fatigue
and
to
subordination
and
had
long
been
accustomed
to
working
together
under
the
immediate
direction
of
foremen
two
questions
of
importance
naturally
arose
at
this
period
first
did
the
american
slave
understand
the
issue
that
had
been
before
the
country
for
more
than
a
and
that
was
now
dividing
the
nation
in
twain
and
marshalling
for
deadly
strife
these
two
opposing
armies
second
had
he
the
courage
necessary
to
take
part
in
the
struggle
and
help
save
the
union
it
would
be
a
strange
thing
to
say
but
nevertheless
a
thing
entirely
true
that
many
of
the
negro
slaves
had
a
clearer
perception
of
the
real
question
at
issue
than
did
some
of
our
most
statesmen
and
a
clearer
vision
of
what
would
be
the
outcome
of
the
war
while
the
great
men
of
the
north
were
striving
to
establish
the
doctrine
that
the
coming
war
was
merely
to
settle
the
question
of
secession
the
slave
knew
better
god
had
hid
certain
things
from
the
wise
and
prudent
and
had
revealed
them
unto
babes
lincoln
the
wisest
of
all
was
slow
to
see
that
the
issue
he
himself
had
predicted
was
really
at
hand
as
president
he
declared
for
the
preservation
of
the
union
with
or
without
slavery
or
even
upon
the
terms
which
he
had
previously
declared
irreconcilable
half
slave
and
half
free
the
negro
slave
saw
in
the
outbreak
of
the
war
the
death
struggle
of
slavery
he
knew
that
the
real
issue
was
slavery
the
masters
were
careful
to
keep
from
the
knowledge
of
the
slave
the
events
as
well
as
the
causes
of
the
war
but
in
spite
of
these
efforts
the
slave
keen
perception
enabled
him
to
read
defeat
in
the
dejected
mien
of
his
master
and
victory
in
his
exultation
to
prevent
the
master
knowing
what
was
going
on
in
their
thoughts
the
slaves
constructed
curious
codes
among
themselves
in
one
neighborhood
freedom
was
always
spoken
of
as
new
rice
and
many
a
poor
slave
woman
sighed
for
the
coming
of
new
rice
in
the
hearing
of
those
who
imagined
they
knew
the
inmost
thoughts
of
their
bondwomen
gleefully
at
times
they
would
talk
of
the
jollification
they
would
make
when
the
new
rice
came
it
was
this
clear
vision
this
strong
hope
that
sustained
them
during
the
trying
days
of
the
war
and
kept
them
back
from
insurrection
bishop
gaines
says
their
prayers
ascended
for
their
deliverance
and
their
hearts
yearned
for
the
success
of
their
friends
they
fondly
hoped
for
the
hour
of
victory
when
the
night
of
slavery
would
end
and
the
dawn
of
freedom
appear
they
often
talked
to
each
other
of
the
progress
of
the
war
and
conferred
in
secret
as
to
what
they
might
do
to
aid
in
the
struggle
worn
out
with
long
bondage
yearning
for
the
boon
of
freedom
longing
for
the
sun
of
liberty
to
rise
they
kept
their
peace
and
left
the
result
to
god
douglass
whom
this
same
bishop
gaines
speaks
of
very
inappropriately
as
a
seemed
able
to
grasp
the
feelings
both
of
the
slave
and
the
freeman
and
said
from
the
first
i
for
one
saw
in
this
war
the
end
of
slavery
and
truth
requires
me
to
say
that
my
interest
in
the
success
of
the
north
was
largely
due
to
this
belief
seward
the
wise
secretary
of
state
had
thought
that
the
war
would
come
and
go
without
producing
any
change
in
the
relation
of
master
and
slave
but
the
humble
slave
on
the
georgia
cotton
plantation
or
in
the
carolina
rice
fields
knew
that
the
booming
of
the
guns
of
rebellion
in
charleston
was
the
opening
note
of
the
death
knell
of
slavery
the
slave
undoubtedly
understood
the
issue
and
knew
on
which
side
liberty
dwelt
although
thoroughly
bred
to
slavery
and
as
contented
and
happy
as
he
could
be
in
his
lot
he
acted
according
to
the
injunction
of
the
apostle
art
thou
called
being
a
servant
care
not
for
it
but
if
thou
mayest
be
made
free
use
it
rather
the
slaves
tried
to
be
contented
but
they
preferred
freedom
and
knew
which
side
to
take
when
the
time
came
for
them
to
act
enough
has
been
said
to
show
that
out
of
the
african
slave
had
been
developed
a
thoroughly
american
slave
so
well
imbued
with
modern
civilization
and
so
well
versed
in
american
politics
as
to
be
partially
ready
for
citizenship
he
had
become
and
and
possessed
of
an
intelligent
desire
to
be
free
whether
he
had
within
him
the
necessary
moral
elements
to
become
a
soldier
the
pages
following
will
attempt
to
make
known
he
had
the
numbers
the
physical
strength
and
the
intelligence
he
could
enter
the
strife
with
a
sufficient
comprehension
of
the
issues
involved
to
enable
him
to
give
to
his
own
heart
a
reason
for
his
action
fitness
for
the
soldier
does
not
necessarily
involve
fitness
for
citizenship
but
the
actual
discharge
of
the
duties
of
the
soldier
in
defence
of
the
nation
entitles
one
to
all
common
rights
to
the
gratitude
and
to
the
highest
honors
for
which
he
is
qualified
in
concluding
this
chapter
i
shall
briefly
return
to
the
free
colored
people
of
the
south
that
the
reader
may
be
able
to
properly
estimate
their
importance
as
a
separate
element
their
influence
upon
the
slave
population
was
very
slight
inasmuch
as
law
and
custom
forbade
the
intercourse
of
these

classes
according
to
the
census
of
there
were
in
the
states
altogether
free

persons
being
mulattoes
in

there
were
free
blacks
and
mulattoes
in

and

in

blacks
and
mulattoes
as
will
be
seen
nearly
of
the
entire
number
of
free
colored
persons
were
mulattoes
while
in
the
leading
southern
cities
per
cent
of
the
free
colored
people
were
put
in
this
class
the
percentage
of
mulatto
slaves
to
the
total
slave
population
at
that
time
was
and
in
the
same
cities
which
showed
per
cent
of
all
the
free
colored
persons
mulattoes
the
percentage
of
mulatto
slaves
was
but
mulatto
in
this
classification
includes
all
colored
persons
who
are
not
put
down
as
black
in
new
orleans
the
free
mulattoes
were
generally
french
having
come
into
the
union
with
the
louisiana
purchase
and
among
them
were
to
be
found
wealthy
they
much
resembled
the
class
of
mulattoes
which
obtained
in
domingo
at
the
beginning
of
the
century
and
had
but
little
sympathy
with
the
blacks
although
they
were
the
first
to
acquiesce
in
emancipation
some
of
them
actually
leading
their
own
slaves
into
the
army
of
liberation
it
is
possible
however
that
they
had
not
fully
realized
the
trend
of
the
war
inasmuch
as
new
orleans
was
excepted
from
the
effects
of
the
proclamation
it
is
certain
that
the
free
colored
people
of
that
city
made
a
tender
of
support
to
the
confederacy
although
they
were
among
the
first
to
welcome
the
conquering
yankees
and
afterward
fought
with
marked
gallantry
in
the
union
cause
the
free
mulattoes
or
as
they
called
themselves
of
charleston
followed
much
the
same
course
as
their
fellow
classmen
of
new
orleans
here
too
they
had
been
exclusive
and
to
some
extent
had
tendered
their
services
to
the
confederacy
and
had
hastily
come
forward
to
welcome
the
conquerors
they
were
foremost
among
the
colored
people
in
wealth
and
intelligence
but
their
field
of
social
operations
had
been
so
circumscribed
that
they
had
exerted
but
little
influence
in
the
work
of
americanizing
the
slave
separated
from
the
slave
by
law
and
custom
they
did
all
in
their
power
to
separate
themselves
from
him
in
thought
and
feeling
they
drew
the
line
against
all
blacks
as
mercilessly
and
senselessly
as
the
most
prejudiced
of
the
whites
and
were
duplicates
of
the
whites
placed
on
an
intermediate
plane
it
was
not
unusual
to
find
a
charleston
brown
filled
with
more
prejudice
toward
the
blacks
than
were
the
whites

while
in

there
were
as
early
as
the
free
colored
people
of
philadelphia
through
two
distinguished
representatives
absalom
jones
and
richard
allen
two
men
of
the
african
race
as
the
chroniclers
say
saw
the
irreligious
and
uncivilized
state
of
the
people
of
their
complexion
and
finally
concluded
that
a
society
should
be
formed
without
regard
to
religious
tenets
provided
the
persons
lived
an
orderly
and
sober
life
the
purpose
of
the
society
being
to
support
one
another
in
sickness
and
for
the
benefit
of
their
widows
and
fatherless
children
accordingly
a
society
was
established
known
as
the
free
african
society
of
philadelphia
and
on
the
articles
were
published
including
the
following
which
is
inserted
to
show
the
breadth
of
the
society
purpose
and
we
apprehend
it
to
be
necessary
that
the
children
of
our
deceased
members
be
under
the
care
of
the
society
so
far
as
to
pay
for
the
education
of
their
children
if
they
can
not
attend
free
school
also
to
put
them
out
apprentices
to
suitable
trades
or
places
if
required
shortly
after
this
we
read
of
the
african
school
for
the
free
instruction
of
the
black
people
and
in
the
evening
free
school
held
at
the
african
methodist
meeting
house
in
philadelphia
was
reported
as
being
kept
very
orderly
the
scholars
behaving
in
a
becoming
manner
and
their
improvement
beyond
the
expectations
their
intellects
appearing
in
every
branch
of
learning
to
be
equal
to
those
of
the
fairest
complexion
the
name
african
as
the
reader
will
notice
is
used
with
reference
to
school
church
and
individuals
although
not
to
the
complete
exclusion
of
colored
people
and
people
of
color
these
phrases
seem
to
have
been
coined
in
the
west
indies
and
were
there
applied
only
to
persons
of
mixed
european
and
african
descent
in
the
united
states
they
never
obtained
such
restricted
use
except
in
a
very
few
localities
the
practice
of
using
african
as
a
descriptive
title
of
the
free
colored
people
of
the
north
became
very
extensive
and
so
continued
up
to
the
middle
of
the
century
there
were
african
societies
churches
and
schools
in
all
the
prominent
centres
of
this
population
in
one
loveridge
agent
for
colored
schools
of
new
york
wrote
the
editor
of
the
african
methodist
magazine
as
follows
as
to
the
name
of
your
periodical
act
as
we
did
with
the
name
of
our
schools
away
with
africa
there
are
no
africans
in
your
connection
substitute
colored
for
african
and
it
will
be
in
my
opinion
as
it
should
be
the
earnestness
of
the
writer
shows
that
the
matter
of
parting
with
african
was
then
a
live
question
the
cool
reply
of
the
editor
indicates
how
strong
was
the
conservative
element
among
the
african
people
of
he
says
we
are
unable
to
see
the
reasonableness
of
the
remarks
it
is
true
we
are
not
africans
or
natives
born
upon
the
soil
of
africa
yet
as
the
descendants
of
that
race
how
can
we
better
manifest
that
respect
due
to
our
fathers
who
begat
us
than
by
the
adoption
of
the
term
in
our
institutions
and
inscribing
it
upon
our
public
places
of
resort
to
this
loveridge
rejoins
in
the
following
explanatory
paragraph
we
who
are
engaged
in
the
public
schools
in
this
city
found
upon
examination
of
about
children
who
attend
our
schools
from
year
to
year
not
one
african
child
among
them
a
suggestion
was
made
that
we
petition
the
public
school
society
to
change
the
name
african
to
colored
schools
the
gentlemen
of
that
honorable
body
perceiving
our
petition
to
be
a
logical
one
acquiesced
with
us
hence
the
adjective
african
which
does
not
apply
to
us
was
blotted
out
and
colored
substituted
in
its
place
it
is
schools
for
colored
children
we
are
americans
and
expect
american
sympathies
in
the
colored
methodists
conceived
the
idea
of
organizing
and
evangelizing
their
race
and
to
this
end
a
convention
was
called
and
assembled
in
philadelphia
of
that
year
composed
of
sixteen
delegates
coming
from
pennsylvania
delaware
maryland
and
new
jersey
the
convention
adopted
a
resolution
that
the
people
of
philadelphia
baltimore
and
all
other
places
who
should
unite
with
them
should
become
one
body
under
the
name
and
style
of
the
african
methodist
episcopal
church
similar
action
was
taken
by
two
other
bodies
of
colored
methodists
one
in
new
york
the
other
in
wilmington
delaware
about
the
same
time
the
people
were
coming
together
and
beginning
to
understand
the
value
of
organization
this
was
manifested
in
their
religious
beneficial
and
educational
associations
that
were
springing
up
among
them
in
the
african
methodist
magazine
appeared
the
first
organ
of
religious
communication
and
thought
issued
by
the
american
colored
people
it
was
published
in
brooklyn
rev
george
hogarth
being
its
editor
there
were
papers
published
by
the
colored
people
prior
to
the
appearance
of
the
african
methodist
magazine
but
these
were
individual
enterprises
they
were
however
indices
of
the
thought
of
the
race
and
looking
back
upon
them
now
we
may
regard
them
as
set
up
along
the
line
of
march
over
which
the
people
have
come
new
york
city
and
state
appears
to
have
been
the
home
of
these
early
harbingers
and
it
was
there
that
the
earliest
literary
centre
was
established
corresponding
to
that
centre
of
religious
life
and
thought
which
had
been
earlier
founded
in
philadelphia
in
the
first
newspaper
published
on
this
continent
by
colored
men
issued
from
its
office
in
new
york
it
was
called
freedom
journal
and
had
for
its
motto
righteousness
exalteth
a
nation
its
editors
and
proprietors
were
cornish
russwurm
its
name
was
subsequently
changed
to
the
rights
of
all
cornish
probably
retiring
and
in
it
suspended
russwurm
going
to
africa
then
followed
the
weekly
advocate
the
american
the
colored
american
the
elevator
the
national
watchman
the
clarion
the
ram
horn
the
north
star
frederick
douglass
paper
and
finally
that
crowning
literary
work
of
the
race
the
the
appeared
in
under
the
management
of
the
strongest
and
most
brilliant
purely
literary
families
the
american
negro
up
to
that
time
had
produced
it
was
edited
and
published
by
thomas
hamilton
and
like
all
the
important
literary
ventures
of
the
race
in
those
days
had
its
birth
in
new
york
it
came
out
in
and
continued
through
the
war
and
in
went
out
of
existence
honorably
having
its
work
well
done
its
first
volume
that
of
contains
the
ablest
papers
ever
given
to
the
public
by
the
american
negro
and
taken
as
a
whole
this
volume
is
the
proudest
literary
monument
the
race
has
as
yet
erected
reviewing
the
progress
of
the
race
in
the
north
we
may
say
the
period
of
organized
benevolence
and
united
religious
effort
began
before
the
close
of
the
past
century
philadelphia
being
its
place
of
origin
that
the
religious
movement
reached
much
broader
and
clearer
standing
about
and
in
consequence
there
sprang
up
organizations
comprehending
the
people
of
the
whole
country
that
the
religious
movement
advanced
to
a
more
intellectual
stage
when
in
the
african
methodist
magazine
appeared
since
which
time
the
organized
religion
of
the
american
negro
has
never
been
for
any
considerable
time
without
its
organs
of
communication
the
journalistic
period
began
in
its
centre
being
new
york
and
the
work
of
the
journals
almost
wholly
directed
to
two
ends
the
abolition
of
slavery
and
the
enfranchisement
and
political
elevation
of
the
free
blacks
this
work
had
reached
its
highest
form
in
the
as
that
epoch
of
our
national
history
came
to
its
close
in
the
war
the
titles
of
the
newspapers
indicate
the
opening
and
continuance
of
a
period
of
agitation
their
columns
were
filled
with
arguments
and
appeals
furnished
by
men
who
gave
their
whole
souls
to
the
work
it
was
a
period
of
great
mental
activity
on
the
part
of
the
free
colored
people
they
were
discussing
all
probable
methods
of
bettering
their
condition
it
was
the
period
that
produced
both
writers
and
orators
in
the
first
convention
called
by
colored
men
to
consider
the
general
condition
of
the
race
and
devise
means
to
improve
that
condition
met
in
the
city
of
philadelphia
the
history
of
this
convention
is
so
important
that
i
append
a
full
account
of
it
as
published
in
the
nearly
thirty
years
after
the
convention
met
it
was
called
through
the
efforts
of
hezekiah
grice
of
baltimore
who
afterwards
emigrated
to
hayti
and
for
many
years
followed
there
the
occupation
of
carver
and
gilder
and
finally
became
director
of
public
works
of
the
city
of
while
visiting
that
city
years
ago
i
met
a
descendant
of
grice
a
lady
of
great
personal
beauty
charming
manners
accomplished
in
the
french
language
but
incapable
of
conversing
at
all
in
english
the
conventions
begun
in
continued
to
be
held
annually
for
a
brief
period
and
then
dropped
into
occasional
and
special
gatherings
they
did
much
good
in
the
way
of
giving
prominence
to
the
colored
orators
and
in
stemming
the
tide
of
hostile
sentiment
by
appealing
to
the
country
at
large
in
language
that
reached
many
hearts
the
physical
condition
so
far
as
the
health
and
strength
of
the
free
colored
people
were
concerned
was
good
their
mean
age
was
the
greatest
of
any
element
of
our
population
and
their
increase
was
about
normal
or
per
cent
annually
in
the
twenty
years
from
to
it
had
kept
up
this
rate
with
hardly
the
slightest
variation
while
the
increase
of
the
free
colored
people
of
the
south
during
the
same
period
had
been
per
cent
annually
the
increase
of
persons
of
mixed
blood
in
the
north
did
not
necessarily
imply
laxity
of
morals
as
the
census
compilers
always
delighted
to
say
but
could
be
easily
accounted
for
by
the
marriages
occurring
between
persons
of
this
class
i
have
seen
more
than
fifty
persons
all
of
mixed
blood
descend
from
one
couple
and
these
with
the
persons
joined
to
them
by
marriages
as
they
have
come
to
marriageable
age
amounted
to
over
seventy
souls
all
in
about
a
half
century
that
the
slaves
had
despite
their
fearful
death
rate
the
manumissions
and
the
escapes
increased
twice
as
fast
as
the
free
colored
people
of
the
north
three
times
as
fast
as
the
free
colored
people
of
the
south
and
faster
than
the
white
people
with
all
the
immigration
of
that
period
can
be
accounted
for
only
by
the
enormous
birth
rate
of
that
people
consequent
upon
their
sad
condition
their
increase
was
abnormal
and
when
properly
viewed
proves
too
much
there
is
no
way
of
determining
the
general
wealth
of
the
colored
people
of
the
north
at
the
period
we
are
describing
but
some
light
may
be
thrown
upon
their
material
condition
from
the
consideration
that
they
were
supporting
a
few
publications
and
building
and
supporting
churches
and
were
holders
of
considerable
real
estate
in
new
york
city
the
thirteen
thousand
colored
people
paid
taxes
on
nearly
a
million
and
a
half
in
real
estate
and
had
over
a
quarter
million
of
dollars
in
the
savings
banks
it
is
probable
that
the
thousand
in
philadelphia
owned
more
in
proportion
than
their
brethren
in
new
york
for
they
were
then
well
represented
in
business
in
that
city
there
were
the
fortens
bowers
casseys
gordons
and
later
stephen
smith
william
whipper
and
videl
all
of
whom
were
men
of
wealth
and
business
there
were
nineteen
churches
owned
and
supported
by
colored
people
of
philadelphia
with
a
seating
capacity
of
about
and
valued
at
about
the
schools
set
apart
for
colored
children
were
very
inferior
and
were
often
kept
alive
by
great
sacrifices
on
the
part
of
the
colored
people
themselves
prior
to
the
war
and
in
many
cases
for
some
time
afterward
the
colored
public
schools
were
a
disgrace
to
the
country
a
correspondent
writing
from
hollidaysburg
says
speaking
of
the
school
there
the
result
of
my
inquiries
here
is
that
here
as
in
the
majority
of
other
places
the
interest
manifested
for
the
colored
man
is
more
for
political
effect
and
that
those
who
prate
the
loudest
about
the
moral
elevation
and
political
advancement
of
the
colored
man
are
the
first
to
turn
against
him
when
he
wants
a
friend
the
correspondent
then
goes
on
to
say
that
the
school
directors
persist
in
employing
teachers
totally
incompetent
what
the
schools
were
in
new
york
the
report
made
by
the
new
york
society
for
the
promotion
of
education
among
colored
children
to
the
honorable
commissioners
for
examining
into
the
condition
of
common
schools
in
the
city
and
county
of
new
york
will
show
reverend
charles
ray
who
was
president
of
this
society
and
philip
a
white
its
secretary
both
continued
to
labor
in
the
interest
of
education
unto
the
close
of
their
lives
white
dying
as
a
member
of
the
school
board
of
the
city
of
brooklyn
and
ray
bequeathing
his
library
to
wilberforce
university
at
his
death
in
summing
up
the
conditions
which
they
have
detailed
in
their
report
they
say
from
a
comparison
of
the
school
houses
occupied
by
the
colored
children
with
the
splendid
almost
palatial
edifices
with
manifold
comforts
conveniences
and
elegancies
which
make
up
the
school
houses
for
white
children
in
the
city
of
new
york
it
is
clearly
evident
that
the
colored
children
are
painfully
neglected
and
positively
degraded
pent
up
in
filthy
neighborhoods
in
old
dilapidated
buildings
they
are
held
down
to
low
associations
and
gloomy
surroundings
the
undersigned
enter
their
solemn
protest
against
this
unjust
treatment
of
colored
children
they
believe
with
the
experience
of
massachusetts
and
especially
the
recent
experience
of
boston
before
them
there
is
no
sound
reason
why
colored
children
shall
be
excluded
from
any
of
the
common
schools
supported
by
taxes
levied
alike
on
whites
and
blacks
and
governed
by
officers
elected
by
the
vote
of
colored
as
well
as
white
voters
this
petition
and
remonstrance
had
its
effect
for
mainly
through
its
influence
within
two
years
very
great
improvements
were
made
in
the
condition
of
the
new
york
colored
schools
for
the
especial
benefit
of
those
who
erroneously
think
that
the
purpose
of
giving
industrial
education
is
a
new
thing
in
our
land
as
well
as
for
general
historical
purposes
i
call
attention
to
the
establishment
of
the
institute
for
colored
youth
in
philadelphia
in
this
institute
was
founded
by
the
society
of
friends
and
was
supported
in
its
early
days
and
presumably
still
by
bequests
and
donations
made
by
members
of
that
society
the
objects
of
the
institute
as
set
forth
by
its
founders
years
ago
are
the
education
and
improvement
of
colored
youth
of
both
sexes
to
qualify
them
to
act
as
teachers
and
instructors
to
their
own
people
either
in
the
various
branches
of
school
learning
or
the
mechanic
arts
and
agriculture
two
years
later
the
african
methodists
purchased
one
hundred
and
eighty
acres
of
land
in
eastern
ohio
and
established
what
was
called
the
union
seminary
on
the
manual
labor
plan
it
did
not
succeed
but
it
lingered
along
keeping
alive
the
idea
until
it
was
eclipsed
by
wilberforce
university
into
which
it
was
finally
merged
the
fight
carried
on
in
the
north
into
which
the
colored
men
entered
and
became
powerful
leaders
aroused
the
race
to
a
deep
study
of
the
whole
subject
of
liberty
and
brought
them
in
sympathy
with
all
people
who
had
either
gained
or
were
struggling
for
their
liberties
and
prompted
them
to
investigate
all
countries
offering
to
them
freedom
no
country
was
so
well
studied
by
them
as
hayti
and
from
to
there
had
been
considerable
emigration
thither
liberia
central
and
south
america
and
canada
were
all
considered
under
the
thought
of
emigration
thousands
went
to
hayti
and
to
canada
but
the
bulk
preferred
to
remain
here
they
liked
america
and
had
become
so
thoroughly
in
love
with
the
doctrines
of
the
republic
so
imbued
with
the
pride
of
the
nation
history
so
inspired
with
hope
in
the
nation
future
that
they
resolved
to
live
and
die
on
her
soil
when
the
troublous
times
of
came
and
white
men
were
fleeing
to
canada
colored
men
remained
at
their
posts
they
were
ready
to
stand
by
the
old
flag
and
to
take
up
arms
for
the
union
trusting
that
before
the
close
of
the
strife
the
flag
might
have
to
them
a
new
meaning
an
impassioned
colored
orator
had
said
of
the
flag
its
stars
were
for
the
white
man
and
its
stripes
for
the
negro
and
it
was
very
appropriate
that
the
stripes
should
be
red
the
free
negro
of
the
north
was
prepared
in
to
support
abraham
lincoln
with
as
good
champions
for
universal
liberty
as
the
country
could
present
footnotes
slave
trade

it
is
to
be
noted
that
in
maryland
and
virginia
an
important
number
of
white
serving
women
married
negro
slave
men
in
the
early
days
of
these
colonies
in
there
were
six
high
schools
or
schools
for
higher
education
in

at

in

the
first
convention
of
the
colored
people

it
was
an
event
of
historical
importance

whether
we
regard
the
times

the
men

whom
this
assemblage
was
composed
we
find
matter
for
interesting
and
profitable
consideration
emancipation

two

the
whole

seemed
stirred
up
with
a
universal
excitement
which
when
contrasted
with
the
universal
panics
of

one
to
regard
as
more
than
a
philosophical
speculation
the
doctrine

from
the
creation
as

beating
with

variety

regulate

crystallize
them

and
yet
the
idea
of
the
first
colored
convention
did
not
originate
with
any
of
these
distinguished
men
it
came
from
a
young
man
of
baltimore
then
and
still
unknown
to
fame
born
in
that
city
in
he
was
in
apprenticed
to
a
man
some
two
hundred
miles
off
in
the
southeast
arriving
at
his
field
of
labor
he
worked
hard
nearly
a
week
and
received
poor
fare
in
return
one
day
while
at
work
near
the
house
the
mistress
came
out
and
gave
him
a
furious
scolding
so
furious
indeed
that
her
husband
mildly
interfered
she
drove
the
latter
away
and
threatened
to
take
the
baltimore
out
of
the
lad
with
cowhide
etc
at
this
moment
to
use
his
own
expression
the
lad
became
converted
that
is
he
determined
to
be
his
own
master
as
long
as
he
lived
early
nightfall
found
him
on
his
way
to
baltimore
which
he
reached
after
a
severe
journey
which
tested
his
energy
and
ingenuity
to
the
utmost
at
the
age
of
he
was
engaged
in
the
summer
time
in
supplying
baltimore
with
ice
from
his
cart
and
in
winter
in
cutting
up
pork
for
ellicotts
establishment
he
must
have
been
strong
and
swift
with
knife
and
cleaver
for
in
one
day
he
cut
up
and
dressed
some
four
hundred
and
fifteen
porkers

printed
and
published
in
the
slave
state
of
maryland
in
the
colored
people
of
the
free
states
were
much
excited
on
the
subject
of
emigration
there
had
been
an
emigration
to
hayti
and
also
to
canada
and
some
had
been
driven
to
liberia
by
the
severe
laws
and
brutal
conduct
of
the
fermenters
of
colonization
in
virginia
and
maryland
in
some
districts
of
these
states
the
disguised
whites
would
enter
the
houses
of
free
colored
men
at
night
and
take
them
out
and
give
them
from
thirty
to
fifty
lashes
to
get
them
to
consent
to
go
to
liberia
it
was
in
the
spring
of
that
the
young
man
we
have
sketched
hezekiah
grice
conceived
the
plan
of
calling
together
a
meeting
or
convention
of
colored
men
in
some
place
north
of
the
potomac
for
the
purpose
of
comparing
views
and
of
adopting
a
harmonious
movement
either
of
emigration
or
of
determination
to
remain
in
the
united
states
convinced
of
the
hopelessness
of
contending
against
the
oppressions
in
the
united
states
living
in
the
very
depth
of
that
oppression
and
wrong
his
own
views
looked
to
canada
but
he
held
them
subject
to
the
decision
of
the
majority
of
the
convention
which
might
assemble
on
the
of
april
he
addressed
a
written
circular
to
prominent
colored
men
in
the
free
states
requesting
their
opinions
on
the
necessity
and
propriety
of
holding
such
convention
and
stated
that
if
the
opinions
of
a
sufficient
number
warranted
it
he
would
give
time
and
place
at
which
duly
elected
delegates
might
assemble
four
months
passed
away
and
his
spirit
almost
died
within
him
for
he
had
not
received
a
line
from
any
one
in
reply
when
he
visited
garrison
in
his
office
and
stated
his
project
garrison
took
up
a
copy
of
walker
appeal
and
said
although
it
might
be
right
yet
it
was
too
early
to
have
published
such
a
book
on
the
of
august
however
he
received
a
sudden
and
peremptory
order
from
bishop
allen
to
come
instantly
to
philadelphia
about
the
emigration
matter
he
went
and
found
a
meeting
assembled
to
consider
the
conflicting
reports
on
canada
of
lewis
and
dutton
at
a
subsequent
meeting
held
the
next
night
and
near
the
adjournment
the
bishop
called
grice
aside
and
gave
to
him
to
read
a
printed
circular
issued
from
new
york
city
strongly
approving
of
plan
of
a
convention
and
signed
by
peter
williams
peter
vogelsang
and
thomas
jinnings
the
bishop
added
my
dear
child
we
must
take
some
action
immediately
or
else
these
new
yorkers
will
get
ahead
of
us
the
bishop
left
the
meeting
to
attend
a
lecture
on
chemistry
by
wells
of
baltimore
grice
introduced
the
subject
of
the
convention
and
a
committee
consisting
of
bishop
allen
benjamin
pascal
cyrus
black
james
cornish
and
junius
morel
were
appointed
to
lay
the
matter
before
the
colored
people
of
philadelphia
this
committee
led
doubtless
by
bishop
allen
at
once
issued
a
call
for
a
convention
of
the
colored
men
of
the
united
states
to
be
held
in
the
city
of
philadelphia
on
the
of
september
grice
returned
to
baltimore
rejoicing
at
the
success
of
his
project
but
in
the
same
boat
which
bore
him
down
the
chesapeake
he
was
accosted
by
zollickoffer
a
member
of
the
society
of
friends
a
philadelphian
and
a
warm
and
tried
friend
of
the
blacks
zollickoffer
used
arguments
and
even
entreaties
to
dissuade
grice
from
holding
the
convention
pointing
out
the
dangers
and
difficulties
of
the
same
should
it
succeed
and
the
deep
injury
it
would
do
the
cause
in
case
of
failure
of
course
it
was
reason
and
entreaty
thrown
away
on
the
fifteenth
of
september
grice
again
landed
in
philadelphia
and
in
the
fulness
of
his
expectation
asked
every
colored
man
he
met
about
the
convention
no
one
knew
anything
about
it
the
first
man
did
not
know
the
meaning
of
the
word
and
another
man
said
who
ever
heard
of
colored
people
holding
a
convention
convention
indeed
finally
reaching
the
place
of
meeting
he
found
in
solemn
conclave
the
five
gentlemen
who
had
constituted
themselves
delegates
with
a
warm
welcome
from
bishop
allen
grice
who
came
with
credentials
from
the
people
of
baltimore
was
admitted
as
delegate
a
little
while
after
burton
of
philadelphia
dropped
in
and
demanded
by
what
right
the
six
gentlemen
held
their
seats
as
members
of
the
convention
on
a
hint
from
bishop
allen
pascal
moved
that
burton
be
elected
an
honorary
member
of
the
convention
which
softened
the
doctor
in
half
an
hour
five
or
six
grave
men
members
of
the
zion
methodist
body
in
philadelphia
entered
and
demanded
to
know
by
what
right
the
members
present
held
their
seats
and
undertook
to
represent
the
colored
people
another
hint
from
the
bishop
and
it
was
moved
that
these
gentlemen
be
elected
honorary
members
but
the
gentlemen
would
submit
to
no
such
thing
and
would
accept
nothing
short
of
full
membership
which
was
granted
them
among
the
delegates
were
abraham
shadd
of
delaware
pennington
of
brooklyn
austin
steward
of
rochester
horace
easton
of
boston
and
adams
of
utica
the
main
subject
of
discussion
was
emigration
to
canada
junius
morel
chairman
of
a
committee
on
that
subject
presented
a
report
on
which
there
was
a
two
days
discussion
the
point
discussed
was
that
the
report
stated
that
the
lands
in
canada
were
synonymous
with
those
of
the
northern
states
the
word
synonymous
was
objected
to
and
the
word
similar
proposed
in
its
stead
morel
with
great
vigor
and
ingenuity
defended
the
report
but
was
finally
voted
down
and
the
word
similar
adopted
the
convention
recommended
emigration
to
canada
passed
strong
resolutions
against
the
american
colonization
society
and
at
its
adjournment
appointed
the
next
annual
convention
of
the
people
of
color
to
be
held
in
philadelphia
on
the
first
monday
in
june
at
the
present
day
when
colored
conventions
are
almost
as
frequent
as
church
meetings
it
is
difficult
to
estimate
the
bold
and
daring
spirit
which
inaugurated
the
colored
convention
of
it
was
the
right
move
originating
in
the
right
quarter
and
at
the
right
time
glorious
old
maryland
or
as
one
speaking
in
the
view
that
climate
grows
the
men

hezekiah
grice
at
that
time
in
the
prime
of
his
young
manhood
he
must
have
presented
the

of
one
equal
to
any
fortune
able
to
achieve
any
undertaking
standing
six
feet
high
of
a

and
that
stamp
of
features
out
of
which
the
greek
sculptor
would
have
delighted
to

was
to

would

where
he
listed
in
looking
to
the
important
results
that
grew
out
of
this
convention
the
independence
of
thought
and
of
the
black
man
are
the
most
remarkable
then
the
union
of
purpose
and
union
of
strength
which
grew
out
of
the
acquaintanceship
and
mutual
pledges
of
colored
men
from
different
states
then
the
subsequent
conventions
where
the
great
men
we
have
already
named
and
others
appeared
and
took
part
in
the
discussions
with
manifestations
of
zeal
talent
and
ability
which
attracted
garrison
the
tappans
jocelyn
and
others
of
that
noble
host
who
drawing
no
small
portion
of
their
inspiration
from
their
black
brethren
in
bonds
did
manfully
fight
in
the
days
of
which
tried
men
souls
and
when
to
be
an
abolitionist
was
to
a
large
extent
to
be
a
martyr
we
can
not
help
adding
the
thought
that
had
these
conventions
of
the
colored
people
of
the
united
states
continued
their
annual
sittings
from
until
the
present
time
the
result
would
doubtless
have
been
greater
general
progress
among
our
people
themselves
a
more
united
front
to
meet
past
and
coming
exigencies
and
a
profounder
hold
upon
the
public
attention
and
a
deeper
respect
on
the
part
of
our
enemies
than
we
now
can
boast
of
looking
at
public
opinion
as
it
is
the
living
law
of
the
land
and
yet
a
malleable
ductile
entity
which
can
be
moulded
or
at
least
affected
by
the
thoughts
of
any
masses
vigorously
expressed
we
should
have
become
a
power
on
earth
of
greater
strength
and
influence
than
in
our
present
scattered
and
dwindled
state
we
dare
even
dream
of
the
very
announcement
thirtieth
annual
convention
of
the
colored
people
of
the
united
states
would
bear
a
majestic
front
our
great
gathering
at
rochester
in
commanded
not
only
public
attention
but
respect
and
admiration
should
we
have
such
a
gathering
even
now
once
a
year
not
encumbered
with
elaborate
plans
of
action
with
too
many
wheels
within
wheels
we
can
yet
regain
much
of
the
ground
lost
the
partial
gathering
at
boston
the
other
day
has
already
assumed
its
place
in
the
public
mind
and
won
its
way
into
the
calculations
of
the
politicians
our
readers
will
doubtless
be
glad
to
learn
the
subsequent
history
of
grice
he
did
not
attend
the
second
convention
but
in
the
interval
between
the
second
and
third
he
formed
in
the
city
of
baltimore
a
legal
rights
association
for
the
purpose
of
ascertaining
the
legal
status
of
the
colored
man
in
the
united
states
it
was
entirely
composed
of
colored
men
among
whom
were
watkins
the
colored
baltimorean
deaver
and
others
grice
called
on
william
wirt
and
asked
him
what
he
charged
for
his
opinion
on
a
given
subject
fifty
dollars
then
sir
i
will
give
you
fifty
dollars
if
you
will
give
me
your
opinion
on
the
legal
condition
of
a
free
colored
man
in
these
united
states
wirt
required
the
questions
to
be
written
out
in
proper
form
before
he
could
answer
them
grice
employed
tyson
who
drew
up
a
series
of
questions
based
upon
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
relating
to
the
rights
and
citizenship
of
the
free
black
he
carried
the
questions
to
wirt
who
glancing
over
them
said
really
sir
my
position
as
an
officer
under
the
government
renders
it
a
delicate
matter
for
me
to
answer
these
questions
as
they
should
be
answered
but
i
tell
you
what
to
do
they
should
be
answered
and
by
the
best
legal
talent
in
the
land
do
you
go
to
philadelphia
and
present
my
name
to
horace
binney
and
he
will
give
you
an
answer
satisfactory
to
you
and
which
will
command
the
greatest
respect
throughout
the
land
grice
went
to
philadelphia
and
presented
the
questions
and
request
to
horace
binney
this
gentleman
pleaded
age
and
poor
eyesight
but
told
grice
that
if
he
would
call
on
john
sargent
he
would
get
answers
of
requisite
character
and
weight
he
called
on
john
sargent
who
promptly
agreed
to
answer
the
questions
if
binney
would
allow
his
name
to
be
associated
as
an
authority
in
the
replies
binney
again
declined
and
so
the
matter
fell
through
this
is
what
grice
terms
his
dred
scott
case
and
so
it
was
he
attended
the
convention
of
but
by
some
informality
or
a
want
of
credentials
was
not
permitted
to
sit
as
full
member
saul
ejected
from
among
the
prophets
yet
he
was
heard
on
the
subject
of
rights
and
the
doctrine
of
our
rights
as
well
as
the
first
colored
convention
are
due
to
the
same
man
in
chagrined
at
the
colored
people
of
the
united
states
he
migrated
to
hayti
where
until
he
pursued
the
business
of
carver
and
gilder
in
the
latter
year
he
was
appointed
director
of
public
works
in
which
office
he
held
until
two
years
ago
he
is
also
engaged
in
and
has
wide
knowledge
of
machinery
and
engineering
every
two
or
three
years
he
visits
new
york
and
is
welcomed
to
the
arcana
of
such
men
as
james
mapes
the
bensons
dunhams
and
at
the
various
works
where
steam
and
iron
obey
human
ingenuity
in
our
city
he
is
at
present
in
this
city
lodging
at
the
house
of
the
widow
of
his
old
friend
and
coadjutor
thomas
jinnings
reade
street
we
have
availed
ourselves
of
his
presence
among
us
to
glean
from
him
the
statements
which
we
have
imperfectly
put
together
in
this
article
we
can
not
dismiss
this
subject
without
the
remark
of
peculiar
pertinence
at
this
moment
that
it
would
have
been
better
for
our
people
had
grice
never
left
these
united
states
the
years
he
has
passed
in
hayti
although
not
without
their
mark
on
the
fortunes
of
that
island
are
yet
with
out
such
mark
as
he
would
have
made
in
the
land
and
upon
the
institutions
among
which
he
was
born
so
early
as
his
year
before
he
had
reached
his
intellectual
prime
he
had
inaugurated
two
of
the
leading
ideas
on
which
our
people
have
since
acted
conventions
to
consider
and
alleviate
their
grievances
and
the
struggle
for
legal
rights
if
he
did
such
things
in
early
youth
what
might
he
not
have
done
with
the
full
force
and
bent
of
his
matured
intellect
and
where
in
the
wide
world
in
what
region
or
under
what
sun
could
he
so
effectually
have
labored
to
elevate
the
black
man
as
on
this
soil
and
under
american
institutions
so
profoundly
are
we
opposed
to
the
favorite
doctrine
of
the
puritans
and
their
the
colonizationists
ubi
libertas
ibi
patria
that
we
could
almost
beseech
divine
providence
to
reverse
some
past
events
and
to
fling
back
into
the
heart
of
virginia
and
maryland
their
sam
wards
highland
garnets
penningtons
frederick
douglasses
and
the
twenty
thousand
who
now
shout
hosannas
in

always

which
make
up

it
is
evident
that
the
colored

are
painfully
neglected
and
positively
degraded
pent
up
in
filthy
neighborhoods
in
old
and
dilapidated
buildings
they
are
held
down
to
low

held
in

medals
awarded
by
the
society
now
addressing
your
honorable
body
declared
the
reading
and
spelling
equal
to
that
of
any
schools
in
the
city
the
undersigned
enter
their
solemn
protest
against
this
unjust
treatment
of
colored
children
they
believe
with
the
experience
of
massachusetts
and
especially
the
recent
experience
of
boston
before
them
there
is
no
sound
reason
why
colored
children
shall
be
excluded
from
any
of
the
common
schools
supported
by
taxes
levied
alike
on
whites
and
blacks
and
governed
by
officers
elected
by
the
vote
of
colored
as
well
as
white
voters
but
if
in
the
judgment
of
your
honorable
body
common
schools
are
not
thus
common
to
all
then
we
earnestly
pray
you
to
recommend
to
the
legislature
such
action
as
shall
cause
the
board
of
education
of
this
city
to
erect
at
least
two
modern
grammar
schools
for
colored
children
on
suitable
sites
in
respectable
localities
so
that
the
attendance
of
colored
children
may
be
increased
and
their
minds
be
elevated
in
like
manner
as
the
happy
experience
of
the
honorable
board
of
education
has
been
in
the
matter
of
white
children
in
addition
to
the
excellent
impulse
to
colored
youth
which
these
new
grammar
schools
would
give
they
will
have
the
additional
argument
of
actual
economy
the
children
will
be
taught
with
far
less
expense
in
two
such
schoolhouses
than
in
the
half
dozen
hovels
into
which
they
are
now
driven
it
is
a
costly
piece
of
injustice
which
educates
the
white
scholar
in
a
palace
at
per
year
and
the
colored
pupil
in
a
hovel
at
or
per
annum
taxes
of
colored
population
of
the
city
no
proposition
can
be
more
reasonable
than
that
they
who
pay
taxes
for
schools
and
schoolhouses
should
be
provided
with
schools
and
schoolhouses
the
colored
population
of
this
city
in
proportion
to
their
numbers
pay
their
full
share
of
the
general
and
therefore
of
the
school
taxes
there
are
about
nine
thousand
adults
of
both
sexes
of
these
over
three
thousand
are
householders
and
therefore
in
that
sense
of
the
word
in
which
owners
make
of
their
poor
tenants
the
colored
laboring
man
with
an
income
of
a
year
who
pays
per
year
for
a
room
and
bedroom
is
really
in
proportion
to
his
means
a
larger
than
the
millionaire
whose
tax
rate
is
thousands
of
dollars
but
directly
also
do
the
colored
people
pay
taxes
from
examinations
carefully
made

undersigned
affirm
that

notes
do
you

make
a
soldier
is
the
opening
line
of
one
of
those
delightful
spirituals
originating
among
the
slaves
in
the
far
south
i
first
heard
it
sung
in
the
saint
james
methodist
church
corner
of
spring
and
coming
streets
charleston
south
carolina
immediately
after
the
close
of
the
war
it
was
sung
by
a
vast
congregation
to
a
gentle
swinging
air
with
nothing
of
the
martial
about
it
and
was
accompanied
by
a
swaying
of
the
body
to
the
time
of
the
music
occasionally
there
would
be
the
curtesys
peculiar
to
the
south
carolina
slave
of
the
low
country
which
consists
in
a
stooping
of
the
body
by
bending
the
knees
only
the
head
remaining
erect
a
movement
which
takes
the
place
of
the
bow
among
equals
the
older
ladies
with
heads
adorned
with
the
madras
kerchief
often
tied
in
the
most
becoming
and
tasteful
manner
and
faces
aglow
with
an
enthusiasm
that
bespoke
a
life
within
sustained
by
visions
of
spiritual
things
would
often
be
seen
to
shake
hands
and
add
a
word
of
greeting
and
hope
which
would
impart
a
charm
and
meaning
to
the
singing
far
above
what
the
humble
words
of
the
song
without
these
accessories
could
convey
as
the
rich
chorus
of
matchless
voices
poured
out
in
perfect
time
and
tune
rise
shine
and
give
god
the
glory
the
thoughts
of
earthly
freedom
of
freedom
from
sin
and
finally
of
freedom
from
the
toils
cares
and
sorrows
of
earth
to
be
baptized
into
the
joys
of
heaven
all
seemed
to
blend
into
the
many
colored
but
harmonious
strain
the
singing
of
the
simple
hearted
trustful
emancipated
slave
shall
we
ever
hear
the
like
again
on
earth
alas
that
the
high
hopes
and
glowing
prophecies
of
that
auspicious
hour
have
been
so
deferred
that
the
hearts
of
millions
have
been
made
sick
of
the
songs
that
came
out
of
slavery
with
these
long
suffering
people
colonel
higginson
who
perhaps
got
nearer
to
them
in
sentiment
than
any
other
literary
man
not
really
of
them
says
almost
all
their
songs
were
thoroughly
religious
in
their
tone
however
quaint
their
expression
and
were
in
a
minor
key
both
as
to
words
and
music
the
attitude
is
always
the
same
and
as
a
commentary
on
the
life
of
the
race
is
infinitely
pathetic
nothing
but
patience
for
this
life
nothing
but
triumph
in
the
next
sometimes
the
present
predominates
sometimes
the
future
but
the
combination
is
always
implied
i
do
not
know
when
this
soldier
song
had
its
birth
but
it
may
have
sprung
out
of
the
perplexity
of
the
slave
mind
as
he
contemplated
the
raging
conflict
and
saw
himself
drawn
nearer
and
nearer
to
the
field
of
strife
whether
in
this
song
the
present
predominates
and
the
query
therefore
has
a
strong
primary
reference
to
carnal
weapons
and
to
garments
dyed
in
blood
whether
the
singer
invites
an
opinion
as
to
his
fitness
to
engage
in
the
war
for
freedom
it
may
not
be
possible
to
determine
the
year
of
jubilee
coming
in
the
same
song
in
connection
with
the
purpose
for
which
the
singer
is
to
be
made
a
soldier
gives
clearer
illustration
of
that
combination
of
the
present
and
future
which
higginson
says
was
always
present
in
the
spirituals
of
that
period
if
it
shows
no
more
when
it
is
remembered
that
at
that
time
charleston
was
literally
trodden
under
foot
by
black
soldiers
in
bright
uniforms
whose
coming
seemed
to
the
colored
people
of
that
city
like
a
dream
too
good
to
be
true
it
is
not
hard
to
believe
that
this
song
had
much
of
the
present
in
it
and
owed
its
birth
to
the
circumstances
of
war
singularly
enough
the
song
makes
the
negro
ask
the
exact
question
which
had
been
asked
about
him
from
the
earliest
days
of
our
history
as
a
nation
a
question
which
in
some
form
confronts
him
still
the
question
as
the
song
has
it
is
not
one
of
fact
but
one
of
opinion
it
is
not
will
i
make
a
soldier
but
do
you
think
i
will
make
a
soldier
it
is
one
thing
to
make
a
soldier
another
thing
to
have
men
think
so
the
question
of
fact
was
settled
a
century
ago
the
question
of
opinion
is
still
unsettled
the
negro
soldier
hero
of
five
hundred
battlefields
with
medals
and
honors
resting
upon
his
breast
with
the
endorsement
of
the
highest
military
authority
of
the
nation
with
port
hudson
el
caney
and
san
juan
behind
him
is
still
expected
by
too
many
to
stand
and
await
the
verdict
of
thought
from
persons
who
never
did
think
he
would
make
a
soldier
and
who
never
will
think
so
as
well
expect
the
excited
animal
of
the
ring
to
in
the
presence
of
the
red
rag
of
the
toreador
as
to
expect
to
think
on
the
subject
of
the
negro
soldier
they
can
curse
and
rant
when
they
see
the
stalwart
negro
in
uniform
but
it
is
too
much
to
ask
them
to
think
to
them
the
negro
can
be
a
fiend
a
brute
but
never
a
soldier
to
john
whittier
and
to
william
nell
are
we
indebted
for
the
earliest
recital
of
the
heroic
deeds
of
the
colored
american
in
the
wars
of
the
revolution
and
whittier
contributed
an
article
on
this
subject
to
the
national
era
in
and
five
or
six
years
later
nell
published
his
pamphlet
on
colored
patriots
a
booklet
recently
reprinted
by
the
african
methodist
episcopal
church
it
is
a
useful
contribution
showing
as
it
does
the
rising
and
spreading
abroad
of
that
spirit
which
appreciates
military
effort
and
valor
and
while
recognizing
the
glory
that
came
to
american
arms
in
the
period
described
honestly
seeks
to
place
some
of
that
glory
upon
the
deserving
brow
of
a
race
then
enslaved
and
despised
the
book
is
unpretentious
and
aims
to
relate
the
facts
in
a
way
unaccompanied
by
any
of
the
charms
of
tasteful
presentation
its
author
however
is
deserving
our
thanks
and
the
book
marks
an
important
stage
in
the
development
of
the
colored
american
his
mind
was
turning
toward
the
creation
of
the
soldier
the
formation
of
armies
there
are
other
evidences
that
the
mind
of
the
colored
man
was
at
this
time
turning
towards
arms
in
doctor
pennington
one
of
the
most
learned
colored
men
of
his
times
having
received
his
degree
in
divinity
from
heidelberg
delivered
an
address
before
a
mass
convention
of
colored
citizens
of
ohio
held
in
cleveland
in
which
he
spoke
principally
of
the
colored
soldier
during
the
convention
the
cleveland
light
artillery
fired
a
salute
and
on
the
platform
were
seated
several
veteran
colored
men
some
of
them
particularly
john
julius
of
pittsburg
taking
part
in
the
nell
says
within
recent
period
several
companies
of
colored
men
in
new
york
city
have
enrolled
themselves
a
la
militaire
and
quotes
from
the
new
york
tribune
of
august
as
follows
colored
among
the
many
parades
within
a
few
days
we
noticed
yesterday
a
company
of
colored
men
on
their
way
homeward
from
a
target
or
parade
drill
they
looked
like
men
handled
their
arms
like
men
and
should
occasion
demand
we
presume
they
would
fight
like
men
in
boston
new
haven
new
bedford
and
other
places
efforts
were
made
during
the
decade
from
to
to
manifest
this
rising
military
spirit
by
appropriate
organization
but
the
efforts
were
not
always
successful
in
some
cases
the
prejudices
of
the
whites
put
every
possible
obstacle
in
the
way
of
the
colored
young
men
who
attempted
to
array
themselves
as
soldiers
the
martial
spirit
is
not
foreign
to
the
negro
character
as
has
been
abundantly
proved
in
both
ancient
and
modern
times
williams
in
his
admirable
history
of
the
negro
as
well
as
in
his
negro
troops
in
the
rebellion
has
shown
at
considerable
length
that
the
negro
has
been
a
soldier
from
earliest
times
serving
in
large
numbers
in
the
egyptian
army
long
before
the
beginning
of
the
christian
era
we
know
that
without
any
great
modification
in
character
runaway
slaves
developed
excellent
fighting
qualities
as
maroons
in
trinidad
british
guiana
domingo
and
in
florida
but
it
was
in
hayti
that
the
unmixed
negro
rose
to
the
full
dignity
of
a
modern
soldier
creating
and
leading
armies
conducting
and
carrying
on
war
treating
with
enemies
and
receiving
surrenders
complying
fully
with
the
rules
of
civilized
warfare
and
evolving
finally
a
toussaint
whose
military
genius
his
most
bitter
enemies
were
compelled
to
recognize
toussaint
who
to
the
high
qualities
of
the
soldier
added
also
the
higher
qualities
of
statesmanship
with
napoleon
cromwell
and
washington
the
three
great
commanders
of
modern
times
who
have
joined
to
high
military
talent
eminent
ability
in
the
art
of
civil
government
we
must
also
class
toussaint
the
black
soldier
of
the
antilles
thiers
the
prejudiced
attorney
of
napoleon
declares
nevertheless
that
toussaint
possessed
wonderful
talent
for
government
and
the
fact
ever
remains
that
under
his
benign
rule
all
classes
were
pacified
and
san
domingo
was
made
to
blossom
as
the
rose
in
the
armies
of
menelek
in
the
armies
of
france
in
the
armies
of
england
as
well
as
in
the
organization
of
the
zulu
and
kaffir
tribes
the
negro
has
shown
himself
a
soldier
if
the
should
fail
in
this
particular
it
will
not
be
because
of
any
lack
of
the
military
element
in
the
african
side
of
his
character
or
for
any
lack
of
remorseless
military
audacity
in
the
original
negro
as
the
historian
williams
expresses
it
in
our
own
revolutionary
war
the
negro
then
but
partially
civilized
and
classed
with
vagabonds
held
everywhere
as
a
slave
and
everywhere
distrusted
against
protest
and
enactment
made
his
way
into
the
patriot
army
fighting
side
by
side
with
his
white
compatriots
from
lexington
to
yorktown
on
the
morning
of
april
when
the
british
were
preparing
to
leave
boston
for
lexington
a
negro
soldier
who
had
served
in
the
french
war
commanded
a
small
body
of
west
cambridge
exempts
and
captured
lord
percy
supply
train
with
its
military
escort
and
the
officer
in
command
as
a
rule
the
negro
soldiers
were
distributed
among
the
regiments
thirty
or
forty
to
a
regiment
and
did
not
serve
in
separate
organizations
bishop
campbell
of
the
african
methodist
church
was
accustomed
to
say
both
of
my
grandfathers
served
in
the
revolutionary
war
in
varnum
brigade
however
there
was
a
negro
regiment
and
of
it
scribner
history
says
speaking
of
the
battle
of
rhode
island
none
behaved
better
than
greene
colored
regiment
which
three
times
repulsed
the
furious
charges
of
veteran
hessians
williams
says
the
black
regiment
was
one
of
three
that
prevented
the
enemy
from
turning
the
flank
of
the
american
army
these
black
troops
were
doubtless
regarded
as
the
weak
spot
of
the
line
but
they
were
not
the
colony
of
massachusetts
alone
furnished
men
for
the
revolutionary
war
while
all
the
colonies
together
south
of
pennsylvania
furnished
but
hence
the
sentiment
prevailing
in
massachusetts
would
naturally
be
very
powerful
in
determining
any
question
pertaining
to
the
army
when
the
country
sprang
to
arms
in
response
to
that
shot
fired
at
lexington
the
echoes
of
which
poetically
speaking
were
heard
around
the
world
the
free
negroes
of
every
northern
colony
rallied
with
their
white
neighbors
they
were
in
the
fight
at
lexington
and
at
bunker
hill
but
when
washington
came
to
take
command
of
the
army
he
soon
gave
orders
that
no
negroes
should
be
enlisted
he
was
sustained
in
this
position
by
a
council
of
war
and
by
a
committee
of
conference
in
which
were
representatives
from
rhode
island
connecticut
and
massachusetts
and
it
was
agreed
that
negroes
be
rejected
altogether
the
american
negro
persistency
in
pressing
himself
where
he
is
not
but
where
he
is
began
right
there
within
six
weeks
so
many
colored
men
applied
for
enlistment
and
those
that
had
been
put
out
of
the
army
raised
such
a
clamor
that
washington
changed
his
policy
and
the
negro
who
of
all
america
population
contended
for
the
privilege
of
shouldering
a
gun
to
fight
for
american
liberty
was
allowed
a
place
in
the
continental
army
the
first
national
army
organized
on
this
soil
the
national
flag
the
negro
soldier
helped
to
evolve
the
national
standard
and
was
in

ranks
of

army
whose
former
owners
were
trying
to
force
to
return
to
a
state
of
servitude
contrary
to
the
principles
of
justice
and
their
solemn
promise
the
act
provided
that
each
and
every
slave
who
had
enlisted
by
the
appointment
and
direction
of
his
owner
and
had
been
received
as
a
substitute
for
any
free
person
whose
duty
or
lot
it
was
to
serve
and
who
had
served
faithfully
during
the
term
of
such
enlistment
unless
lawfully
discharged
earlier
should
be
fully
and
completely
emancipated
and
should
be
held
and
deemed
free
in
as
full
and
ample
manner
as
if
each
and
every
one
of
them
were
specially
named
in
the
act
the
act
though
apparently
so
fair
on
its
face
and
interlarded
as
it
is
with
patriotic
and
moral
phrases
is
nevertheless
very
narrow
and
technical
liberating
only
those
who
enlisted
by
the
appointment
and
direction
of
their
owners
and
who
were
accepted
as
substitutes
and
who
came
out
of
the
army
with
good
discharges
it
is
not
hard
to
see
that
even
under
this
act
many
an
might
end
his
days
in
slavery
the
negro
had
joined
in
the
fight
for
freedom
and
when
victory
is
won
finds
himself
a
slave
he
was
both
a
slave
and
a
soldier
too
often
during
the
war
and
now
at
its
close
may
be
both
a
veteran
and
a
slave
the
second
war
with
great
britain
broke
out
with
an
incident
in
which
the
negro
in
the
navy
was
especially
conspicuous
the
chesapeake
an
american
war
vessel
was
hailed
fired
upon
and
forced
to
strike
her
colors
by
the
british
she
was
then
boarded
and
searched
and
four
persons
taken
from
her
decks
claimed
as
deserters
from
the
english
navy
three
of
these
were
negroes
and
one
white
the
negroes
were
finally
dismissed
with
a
reprimand
and
the
white
man
hanged
five
years
later
hostilities
began
on
land
and
no
opposition
was
manifested
toward
the
employment
of
negro
soldiers
laws
were
passed
especially
in
new
york
authorizing
the
formation
of
regiments
of
blacks
with
white
officers
it
is
remarkable
that
although
the
successful
insurrection
of
domingo
was
so
recent
and
many
refugees
from
that
country
at
that
time
were
in
the
united
states
and
our
country
had
also
but
lately
come
into
possession
of
a
large
french
element
by
the
louisiana
purchase
there
was
no
fear
of
a
servile
insurrection
in
this
country
the
free
colored
men
of
new
orleans
under
the
proclamation
of
the
jackson
rallied
to
the
defence
of
that
city
and
bore
themselves
with
commendable
valor
in
that
useless
battle
the
war
closed
however
and
the
glory
of
the
negro
soldier
who
fought
in
it
soon
expired
in
the
dismal
gloom
of
a
becoming
daily
more
and
hopeless
john
brown
movement
was
military
in
character
and
contemplated
the
creation
of
an
army
of
liberated
slaves
but
its
early
suppression
prevented
any
display
of
negro
valor
or
genius
its
leader
must
ever
receive
the
homage
due
those
who
are
so
moved
by
the
woes
of
others
as
to
overlook
all
considerations
of
policy
and
personal
risk
as
a
plot
for
the
destruction
of
life
it
fell
far
short
of
the
nat
turner
insurrection
which
swept
off
persons
within
a
few
hours
in
purpose
the
two
episodes
agree
they
both
aim
at
the
liberation
of
the
slave
both
were
led
by
fanatics
the
reflex
production
of
the
cruelty
of
slavery
and
both
ended
in
the
melancholy
death
of
their
heroic
leaders
turner
was
the
insurrection
of
the
slave
and
was
not
free
from
the
mad
violence
of
revenge
brown
was
the
insurrection
of
the
friend
of
the
slave
and
was
governed
by
the
high
and
noble
purpose
of
freedom
the
insurrections
of
denmark
vesey
in
south
carolina
in
and
of
nat
turner
in
virginia
in
show
conclusively
that
the
negro
slave
possessed
the
courage
the
cunning
the
secretiveness
and
the
intelligence
to
fight
for
his
freedom
these
two
attempts
were
sufficiently
broad
and
intelligent
when
taken
into
consideration
with
the
enforced
ignorance
of
the
slave
to
prove
the
negro
even
in
his
forlorn
condition
capable
of
daring
great
things
of
the
probable
thousands
who
were
engaged
in
the
denmark
vesey
insurrection
only
fifteen
were
convicted
and
these
died
heroically
without
revealing
anything
connected
with
the
plot
years
later
i
met
the
son
of
denmark
vesey
who
rejoiced
in
the
efforts
of
his
noble
father
and
regarded
his
death
on
the
gallows
as
a
holy
sacrifice
to
the
cause
of
freedom
turner
describes
his
fight
as
follows
the
white
men
eighteen
in
number
approached
us
to
about
one
hundred
yards
when
one
of
them
fired
and
i
discovered
about
half
of
them
retreating
i
then
ordered
my
men
to
fire
and
rush
on
them
the
few
remaining
stood
their
ground
until
we
approached
within
fifty
yards
when
they
fired
and
retreated
we
pursued
and
overtook
some
of
them
whom
we
thought
we
left
dead
after
pursuing
them
about
two
hundred
yards
and
rising
a
little
hill
i
discovered
they
were
met
by
another
party
and
had
halted
and
were
reloading
their
guns
thinking
that
those
who
retreated
first
and
the
party
who
fired
on
us
at
fifty
or
sixty
yards
distant
had
all
only
fallen
back
to
meet
others
with
ammunition
as
i
saw
them
reloading
their
guns
and
more
coming
up
than
i
saw
at
first
and
several
of
my
bravest
men
being
wounded
the
others
became
panic
struck
and
scattered
over
the
field
the
white
men
pursued
and
fired
on
us
several
times
hark
had
his
horse
shot
under
him
and
i
caught
another
for
him
that
was
running
by
me
five
or
six
of
my
men
were
wounded
but
none
left
on
the
field
finding
myself
defeated
here
i
instantly
determined
to
go
through
a
private
way
and
cross
the
nottoway
river
at
cypress
bridge
three
miles
below
jerusalem
and
attack
that
place
in
the
rear
as
i
expected
they
would
look
for
me
on
the
other
road
and
i
had
a
great
desire
to
get
there
to
procure
arms
and
ammunition
after
going
a
short
distance
in
this
private
way
accompanied
by
about
twenty
men
i
overtook
two
or
three
who
told
me
the
others
were
dispersed
in
every
direction
after
trying
in
vain
to
collect
a
sufficient
force
to
proceed
to
jerusalem
i
determined
to
return
as
i
was
sure
they
would
make
back
to
their
old
neighborhood
where
they
would
rejoin
me
make
new
recruits
and
come
down
again
on
my
way
back
i
called
on
thomas
spencer
and
several
other
places
we
stopped
at
major
ridley
quarters
for
the
night
and
being
joined
by
four
of
his
men
with
the
recruits
made
since
my
defeat
we
mustered
now
about
forty
strong
after
placing
out
sentinels
i
lay
down
to
sleep
but
was
quickly
aroused
by
a
great
racket
starting
up
i
found
some
mounted
and
others
in
great
confusion
one
of
the
sentinels
having
given
the
alarm
that
we
were
about
to
be
attacked
i
ordered
some
to
ride
around
and
reconnoitre
and
on
their
return
the
others
being
more
alarmed
not
knowing
who
they
were
fled
in
different
ways
so
that
i
was
reduced
to
about
twenty
again
with
this
i
determined
to
attempt
to
recruit
and
proceed
on
to
rally
in
the
neighborhood
i
had
left
no
one
can
read
this
account
which
is
thoroughly
supported
by
contemporary
testimony
without
seeing
in
this
poor
misguided
slave
the
elements
of
a
vigorous
captain
failing
in
his
efforts
he
made
his
escape
and
remained
for
two
months
in
hiding
in
the
vicinity
of
his
pursuers
one
concerned
in
his
prosecution
says
it
has
been
said
that
he
was
ignorant
and
cowardly
and
that
his
object
was
to
murder
and
rob
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
money
to
make
his
escape
it
is
notorious
that
he
was
never
known
to
have
a
dollar
in
his
life
to
swear
an
oath
or
drink
a
drop
of
spirits
as
to
his
ignorance
he
certainly
never
had
the
advantages
of
education
but
he
can
read
and
write
it
was
taught
him
by
his
parents
and
for
natural
intelligence
and
quickness
of
apprehension
is
surpassed
by
few
men
i
have
ever
seen
as
to
his
being
a
coward
his
reason
as
given
for
not
resisting
phipps
shows
the
decision
of
his
character
the
war
of
the
rebellion
now
called
the
civil
war
effected
the
last
and
tremendous
step
in
the
transition
of
the
american
negro
from
the
position
of
a
slave
under
the
republic
to
that
of
a
soldier
in
its
armies
both
under
officers
of
his
own
race
at
port
hudson
and
under
white
officers
on
a
hundred
battlefields
the
negro
in
arms
proved
himself
a
worthy
foeman
against
the
bravest
and
sternest
enemies
that
ever
assailed
our
nation
flag
and
a
worthy
comrade
of
the
best
defenders
thousand
eight
hundred
and
of
them
gave
their
lives
in
that
awful
conflict
the
entire
race
on
this
continent
and
those
of
allied
blood
throughout
the
world
are
indebted
to
the
honorable
george
williams
for
the
eloquent
story
of
their
service
in
the
union
army
and
for
the
presentation
of
the
high
testimonials
to
the
valor
and
worthiness
of
the
colored
soldier
as
given
by
the
highest
military
authority
of
the
century
from
chapter
xvi
of
his
book
negro
troops
in
the
rebellion
the
paragraphs
appended
at
the
close
of
this
chapter
are
quoted
a
how
the
black
domingo
legion
saved
the
patriot
army
in
the
siege
of
savannah
the
siege
and
attempted
reduction
of
savannah
by
the
combined
french
and
american
forces
is
one
of
the
events
of
our
revolutionary
war
upon
which
our
historians
care
little
to
dwell
because
it
reflects
but
little
glory
upon
the
american
arms
and
resulted
so
disastrously
to
the
american
cause
its
important
historic
character
and
connections
have
been
allowed
to
fade
from
general
sight
and
it
stands
in
the
ordinary
school
much
as
an
affair
of
shame
the
following
quoted
from
barnes
history
is
a
fair
sample
of
the
way
in
which
it
is
treated
attack
on
in
september
joined
lincoln
in
besieging
that
city
after
a
severe
bombardment
an
unsuccessful
assault
was
made
in
which
a
thousand
lives
were
lost
count
pulaski
was
mortally
wounded
the
sergeant
jasper
died
grasping
the
banner
presented
to
his
regiment
at
fort
moultrie
refused
to
give
further
aid
thus
again
deserting
the
americans
when
help
was
most
needed
from
this
brief
sketch
the
reader
is
at
liberty
to
infer
that
the
attack
was
unwise
if
not
that
the
battle
was
unimportant
and
that
the
conduct
of
count
immediately
after
the
battle
was
unkind
if
not
unjust
to
the
americans
while
the
paragraph
does
not
pretend
to
tell
the
whole
truth
what
it
does
tell
ought
to
be
the
truth
and
this
ought
to
be
told
in
such
a
way
as
to
give
correct
impressions
the
attack
upon
savannah
was
and
thoroughly
well
considered
and
it
failed
only
because
the
works
were
so
ably
defended
chiefly
by
british
regulars
under
brave
and
skillful
officers
in
a
remote
way
which
it
is
the
purpose
of
this
paper
to
trace
that
sanguinary
struggle
had
a
wider
bearing
upon
the
progress
of
liberty
in
the
western
world
than
any
other
one
battle
fought
during
the
revolution
but
first
let
us
listen
to
the
story
of
the
battle
itself
colonel
campbell
with
a
force
of
three
thousand
men
captured
savannah
in
december
and
in
the
january
following
general
prevost
arrived
and
by
march
had
established
a
sort
of
civil
government
in
georgia
savannah
being
the
capital
in
april
the
american
general
lincoln
feeble
in
more
senses
than
one
perhaps
began
a
movement
against
savannah
by
way
of
augusta
but
prevost
aware
of
his
purpose
crossed
into
south
carolina
and
attempted
an
attack
upon
charleston
finding
the
city
too
well
defended
he
contented
himself
with
ravaging
the
plantations
over
a
wide
extent
of
adjacent
country
and
returned
to
savannah
laden
with
rich
spoils
among
which
were
included
three
thousand
slaves
of
whose
labor
he
made
good
use
later
the
patriots
of
the
south
now
awaited
in
hope
the
coming
of
the
french
fleet
and
on
the
first
of
september
count
appeared
suddenly
on
the
coast
of
georgia
with
sail
surprised
and
captured
four
british
warships
and
announced
to
the
government
of
south
carolina
his
readiness
to
assist
in
the
recapture
of
savannah
he
urged
as
a
condition
however
that
his
ships
should
not
be
detained
long
off
so
dangerous
a
coast
as
is
was
now
the
hurricane
season
and
there
was
neither
harbor
road
nor
offing
for
their
protection
by
means
of
small
vessels
sent
from
charleston
he
effected
a
landing
in
ten
days
and
four
days
thereafter
on
the
he
summoned
the
garrison
to
surrender
to
the
arms
of
france
although
this
demand
was
made
in
the
name
of
france
for
the
plain
reason
that
the
american
army
was
not
yet
upon
the
spot
the
loyalists
did
not
fail
to
make
it
a
pretext
for
the
accusation
that
the
french
were
desirous
of
making
conquests
in
the
war
on
their
own
account
in
the
meantime
lincoln
with
the
regular
troops
was
hurrying
toward
savannah
and
had
issued
orders
for
the
militia
to
rendezvous
at
the
same
place
and
the
militia
full
of
hope
of
a
speedy
if
not
of
a
bloodless
conquest
were
entering
upon
this
campaign
with
more
than
ordinary
enthusiasm
during
the
time
that
the
fleet
had
been
off
the
coast
and
especially
since
the
landing
the
british
had
been
very
busy
in
putting
the
city
in
a
high
state
of
defence
and
in
making
efforts
to
strengthen
the
garrison
cruger
who
had
a
small
force
at
sunbury
the
last
place
in
georgia
that
had
been
captured
by
the
british
and
maitland
who
was
commanding
a
considerable
force
at
beaufort
were
ordered
to
report
in
haste
with
their
commands
at
savannah
on
the
when
the
summons
to
surrender
was
received
by
prevost
maitland
had
not
arrived
but
was
hourly
expected
prevost
asked
for
a
delay
of
hours
to
consider
the
proposal
which
delay
was
granted
and
on
that
very
evening
maitland
with
his
force
arrived
at
dawfuskie
finding
the
river
in
the
possession
of
the
french
his
course
for
a
time
seemed
effectually
cut
off
by
the
merest
chance
he
fell
in
with
some
negro
fishermen
who
informed
him
of
a
passage
known
as
wall
cut
through
scull
creek
navigable
for
small
boats
a
favoring
tide
and
a
dense
fog
enabled
him
to
conduct
his
command
unperceived
by
the
french
through
this
route
and
thus
arrive
in
savannah
on
the
afternoon
of
the
before
the
expiration
of
the
hours
general
prevost
had
gained
his
point
and
now
believing
himself
able
to
resist
an
assault
declined
the
summons
to
surrender
two
armed
ships
and
four
transports
were
sunk
in
the
channel
of
the
river
below
the
city
and
a
boom
in
the
same
place
laid
entirely
across
the
river
while
several
small
boats
were
sunk
above
the
town
thus
rendering
it
impossible
for
the
city
to
be
approached
by
water
on
the
day
of
the
summons
to
surrender
although
the
works
were
otherwise
well
advanced
there
were
not
ten
cannon
mounted
in
the
lines
of
savannah
but
from
that
time
until
the
day
of
assault
the
men
of
the
garrison
with
the
slaves
they
had
captured
worked
day
and
night
to
get
the
defences
of
the
city
in
the
highest
state
of
excellence
major
moncrief
chief
of
the
engineers
is
credited
with
placing
in
position
more
than
eighty
cannons
in
a
short
time
after
the
call
to
surrender
had
been
received
the
city
itself
at
this
time
was
but
a
mere
village
of
frame
buildings
and
unpaved
streets
viewed
as
facing
its
assailants
it
was
protected
in
its
rear
or
upon
its
north
side
by
the
savannah
river
and
on
its
west
side
by
a
thick
swamp
or
morass
which
communicated
with
the
river
above
the
city
the
exposed
sides
were
those
of
the
east
and
south
these
faced
an
open
country
which
for
several
miles
was
entirely
clear
of
woods
this
exposed
portion
of
the
city
was
well
protected
by
an
unbroken
line
of
defences
extending
from
the
river
back
to
the
swamp
the
right
and
left
extremes
of
the
line
consisting
of
strong
redoubts
while
the
centre
was
made
up
of
seamen
batteries
in
front
with
impalements
and
traverses
thrown
up
to
protect
the
troops
from
the
fire
of
the
besiegers
the
whole
extent
of
the
works
was
faced
with
an
ample
abattis
illustration
savannah
river
to
be
still
more
particular
there
were
three
redoubts
on
the
right
of
the
line
and
on
the
right
of
them
quite
near
the
swamp
was
a
sailor
battery
of
nine
pounders
covered
by
a
company
of
the
british
legion
the
left
redoubt
of
these
three
was
known
as
the
springhill
redoubt
and
proved
to
be
the
objective
of
the
final
assault
between
it
and
the
centre
was
another
sailor
battery
behind
which
were
posted
the
grenadiers
of
the
regiment
with
the
marines
which
had
been
landed
from
the
warships
on
the
left
of
the
line
near
the
river
were
two
redoubts
strongly
constructed
with
a
massy
frame
of
green
spongy
wood
filled
in
with
sand
and
mounted
with
heavy
cannon
the
centre
or
space
between
these
groups
of
redoubts
was
composed
as
has
been
said
of
lighter
but
nevertheless
very
effective
works
and
was
strongly
garrisoned
having
thus
scanned
the
works
let
us
now
take
a
glance
at
the
men
who
are
to
defend
them
as
all
of
the
assaulting
forces
are
not
made
up
of
americans
so
all
of
the
defenders
are
not
foreigners
the
centre
redoubt
of
the
triplet
on
the
right
was
garrisoned
by
two
companies
of
militia
with
the
north
carolina
regiment
to
support
them
captains
roworth
and
wylie
with
the
provincial
corps
of
king
rangers
were
posted
in
the
redoubt
on
the
right
and
captain
tawse
with
his
corps
of
provincial
dragons
dismounted
in
the
left
or
springhill
redoubt
supported
by
the
south
caroline
regiment
the
whole
of
this
force
on
the
right
of
the
line
was
under
the
command
of
the
gallant
maitland
and
it
was
this
force
that
made
the
charge
that
barely
failed
of
annihilating
the
american
army
on
the
left
of
the
line
the
georgia
loyalists
garrisoned
one
of
those
massy
wooden
redoubts
while
in
the
centre
cheek
by
jowl
so
to
speak
with
two
battalions
of
the
regiment
and
two
regiments
of
hessians
stood
the
new
york
volunteers
all
of
these
corps
were
ready
to
act
as
circumstances
should
require
and
to
support
any
part
of
the
line
that
might
be
attacked
the
negroes
who
worked
on
these
defences
were
under
the
direction
of
major
moncrief
the
french
troops
had
landed
below
the
city
and
were
formed
facing
the
british
lines
with
the
river
on
their
right
on
their
left
later
assembled
the
american
troops
the
final
dispositions
were
concluded
by
september
and
were
as
follows
the
american
troops
under
lincoln
formed
the
left
of
the
line
their
left
resting
upon
the
swamp
and
the
entire
division
facing
the
springhill
redoubt
and
her
two
sister
defences
then
came
the
division
of
de
noailles
composed
of
nine
hundred
men
division
of
one
thousand
men
beside
the
artillery
came
next
and
formed
the
centre
of
the
french
army
on
right
was
count
dillon
division
of
nine
hundred
men
on
the
right
of
dillon
were
the
powder
magazine
cattle
depot
and
a
small
field
hospital
on
the
right
of
the
depot
and
a
little
in
advance
were
dejean
dragoons
numbering
fifty
men
upon
the
same
alignment
and
to
the
right
of
the
dragoons
were
rouvrais
volunteer
chasseurs
numbering
seven
hundred
and
fifty
men
still
further
on
to
the
right
and
two
hundred
yards
in
advance
of
rouvrais
was
framais
comanding
the
grenadier
volunteers
and
two
hundred
men
besides
his
right
resting
upon
the
swampy
wood
that
bordered
the
river
thus
completely
closing
in
the
city
on
the
land
side
the
frigate
la
truite
and
two
galleys
lay
within
cannon
shot
of
the
town
and
with
the
aid
of
the
armed
store
ship
la
bricole
and
the
frigate
la
chimere
effectually
cut
off
all
communication
by
water
on
the
both
the
french
and
the
americans
opened
their
trenches
and
on
the
a
small
detachment
of
the
besieged
made
a
sortie
against
the
french
the
attack
was
easily
repulsed
but
the
french
pursuing
approached
so
near
the
entrenchments
of
the
enemy
that
they
were
fired
upon
and
several
were
killed
on
the
night
of
the
another
sortie
was
made
which
threw
the
besiegers
into
some
confusion
and
caused
the
french
and
americans
to
fire
upon
each
other
cannonading
continued
with
but
little
result
until
october
the
engineers
were
now
of
the
opinion
that
a
speedy
reduction
of
the
city
could
not
be
accomplished
by
regular
approaches
and
the
naval
officers
were
very
anxious
about
the
fleet
both
because
of
the
dangers
to
which
it
was
exposed
from
the
sea
and
also
because
with
so
many
men
ashore
it
was
in
especial
danger
of
being
attacked
and
captured
by
british
these
representations
agreeing
altogether
with
previously
expressed
wishes
to
leave
the
coast
as
soon
as
possible
induced
that
officer
and
general
lincoln
to
decide
upon
an
attempt
to
storm
the
british
works
at
once
it
is
quite
probable
that
this
had
been
the
purpose
as
a
last
resort
from
the
first
the
preservation
of
the
fleet
was
however
the
powerful
factor
in
determining
the
time
and
character
of
the
assault
upon
savannah
on
the
night
of
the
eighth
major
with
a
detachment
attempted
to
set
fire
to
the
abattis
in
order
to
clear
the
way
for
the
assault
but
failed
to
through
the
dampness
of
the
wood
the
plan
of
the
assault
may
be
quite
accurately
obtained
from
the
orders
given
to
the
american
troops
on
the
evening
of
the
by
general
lincoln
and
from
the
inferences
to
be
drawn
from
the
events
of
the
morning
of
the
as
they
are
recorded
in
history
at
least
two
of
the
historians
who
have
left
us
accounts
of
the
seige
ramsey
and
mccall
were
present
at
the
time
and
their
accounts
may
be
regarded
as
original
authority
general
lincoln
orders
were
as
follows
evening
orders
by
general
lincoln
watchword
lewis
the
soldiers
will
be
immediately
supplied
with
rounds
of
cartridges
a
spare
flint
and
have
their
arms
in
good
order
the
infantry
destined
for
the
attack
of
savannah
will
be
divided
into
two
bodies
first
composed
of
the
light
troops
under
the
command
of
colonel
laurens
the
second
of
the
continental
battalions
and
the
first
battalion
of
the
charleston
militia
except
the
grenadiers
who
are
to
join
the
light
troops
the
whole
will
parade
at
near
the
left
of
the
line
and
march
by
platoons
the
guards
of
the
camp
will
be
formed
of
the
invalids
and
be
charged
to
keep
the
fires
as
usual
in
camp
the
cavalry
under
the
command
of
count
pulaski
will
parade
at
the
same
time
with
the
infantry
and
follow
the
left
column
of
the
french
troops
precede
the
column
of

troops
they
will
endeavor
to
penetrate
the
enemy
lines
between
the
battery
on
the
left
of
springhill
redoubt
and
the
next
towards
the
river
having
effected
this
will
pass
to
the
left
towards
yamacraw
and
secure
such
parties
of
the
enemy
as
may
be
lodged
in
that
quarter
the
artillery
will
parade
at
the
same
time
follow
the
french
artillery
and
remain
with
the
corps
de
reserve
until
they
receive
further
orders
the
whole
will
be
ready
by
the
time
appointed
with
the
utmost
silence
and
punctuality
and
be
ready
to
march
the
instant
count
dillon
and
general
lincoln
shall
order
the
light
troops
who
are
to

by
escalade
if
possible
if
not
by
entrance
into
it
they
are
to
be
supported
if
necessary
by

regiment
in
the
meantime
the
column
will
proceed
with
the
lines
to
the
left
of
the
springhill
battery
the
light
troops
having
succeeded
against
the
redoubt
will
proceed
to
the
left
and
attempt
the
several
works
between
that
and
the
river
the
column
will
move
to
the
left
of
the
french
troops
taking
care
not
to
interfere
with
them
the
light
troops
having
carried
the
work
towards
the

of

column
it
is
especially
forbidden
to
fire
a

are
carried

to
quit
his
rank
to
plunder
without
an
order
for
that
purpose
any
who
shall
presume
to
transgress
in
either
of
these
respects
shall
be
reputed
a
disobeyer
of

orders
which
is
punishable
with
death
the
militia
of
the
first
and
second
brigades
general
williamson

will
parade
immediately
under

huger
after
draughting
five
hundred
of
them
the
remander
of
them
will
go
into
the
trenches
and
put
themselves
under
the
commanding
officer
there
with
the
he
will
march
to
the
left
of
the
enemy
line
remain
as
near
them
as
he
possibly
can
without
being
seen
until
four
in
the
morning
at
which
time
the
troops
in
the
trenches
will
begin
an
attack
upon
the
enemy
he
will
then
advance
and
make
his
attack
as
near
the
river
as
possible
though
this
is
only
meant
as
a
feint
yet
should
a
favorable
opportunity
offer
he
will
improve
it
and
push
into
the
town
in
case
of
a
repulse
after
taking

redoubt
the
troops
will
retreat
and
rally
in
the
rear
of

if
it
can
not
be
effected
that
way
it
must
be
attempted
by
the

route
at
which
they
entered

or
the
first
if
the

will
be
at

his
five
hundred
militia
covered
by
the
river
swamp
crept
quite
close
to
the
enemy
lines
and
delivered
his
attack
as
directed
its
purpose
was
to
draw
attention
to
that
quarter
and
if
possible
cause
a
weakening
of
the
strength
in
the
left
centre
of
the
line
what
its
real
effect
was
there
is
now
no
means
of
knowing
count
dillon
who
during
the
siege
had
been
on
right
and
who
appears
to
have
been
second
in
command
in
the
french
army
in
this
assault
was
placed
in
command
of
a
second
attacking
column
his
purpose
was
to
move
to
the
right
of
general
huger
and
keeping
in
the
edge
of
the
swamps
along
the
river
steal
past
the
enemy
batteries
on
the
left
and
attack
him
in
the
rear
bancroft
describes
the
results
of
his
efforts
as
follows
the
column
under
count
dillon
which
was
to
have
attacked
the
rear
of
the
british
lines
became
entangled
in
a
swamp
of
which
it
should
only
have
skirted
the
edge
was
helplessly
exposed
to
the
british
batteries
and
could
not
even
be
formed
here
were
the
two
strong
redoubts
mounted
with
heavy
cannon
and
these
may
have
been
the
batteries
that
stopped
dillon
column
count
pulaski
with
his
two
hundred
brave
cavalrymen
undertook
his
part
in
the
deadly
drama
with
ardor
and
began
that
perilous
ride
which
had
for
its
object
to
penetrate
the
enemy
lines
between
the
battery
on
the
left
of
the
springhill
redoubt
and
the
next
towards
the
river
balch
describes
it
as
an
attempt
to
penetrate
into
the
city
by
galloping
between
the
redoubts
it
was
the
anticipation
of
the
crimean
charge
of
the
light
brigade
only
in
this
case
no
one
blundered
it
was
simply
a
desperate
chance
cannon
were
to
the
right
left
and
front
and
the
heroic
charge
proved
in
vain
the
noble
pole
fell
banner
in
hand
pierced
with
a
mortal
wound
another
foreign
martyr
to
our
dearly
bought
freedom
the
cavalry
dash
having
failed
that
much
of
the
general
plan
was
blotted
out
the
feints
may
have
been
understood
it
is
said
a
sergeant
of
the
charleston
grenadiers
deserted
during
the
night
of
the
and
gave
the
whole
plan
of
the
attack
to
general
prevost
so
that
he
knew
just
where
to
strengthen
his
lines
the
feints
were
effectually
checked
by
the
garrison
on
the
left
of
the
americans
being
killed
while
dillon
column
was
stopped
by
the
batteries
near
the
river
this
state
of
affairs
allowed
the
whole
of
maitland
force
to
protect
the
springhill
redoubt
and
that
part
of
the
line
which
was
most
threatened
the
springhill
redoubt
as
has
been
stated
was
occupied
by
the
south
carolina
regiment
and
a
corps
of
dragoons
this
circumstance
may
account
for
the
fact
that
while
the
three
hundred
and
fifty
charleston
militia
occupied
a
most
exposed
position
in
the
attacking
column
only
one
man
among
them
was
killed
and
but
six
wounded
the
battery
on
the
left
of
this
redoubt
was
garrisoned
by
grenadiers
and
marines
the
attacking
column
now
advanced
boldly
under
the
command
of
and
lincoln
the
americans
consisting
of
six
hundred
continental
troops
and
three
hundred
and
fifty
charleston
militia
being
on
the
left
while
the
centre
and
right
were
made
up
of
the
french
forces
they
were
met
with
so
severe
and
steady
a
fire
that
the
head
of
the
column
was
soon
thrown
into
confusion
they
endured
this
fire
for
minutes
returning
it
as
best
they
could
although
many
of
the
men
had
no
opportunity
to
fire
at
all
two
american
standards
and
one
french
standard
were
placed
on
the
british
works
but
their
bearers
were
instantly
killed
it
being
found
impossible
to
carry
any
part
of
the
works
a
general
retreat
was
ordered
of
the
six
hundred
continental
troops
more
than
had
fallen
and
about
of
the
french
the
charleston
militia
had
not
suffered
although
they
had
bravely
borne
their
part
in
the
assault
and
it
had
certainly
been
no
fault
of
theirs
if
their
brethren
behind
the
embankments
had
not
fired
upon
them
count
had
received
two
wounds
one
in
the
thigh

with
the

it
was
then
that
there
occurred
the
most
brilliant
feat
of
the
day

one
of
the
bravest
ever
performed
by
foreign
troops
in
the
american
cause
in

a
legion
of

at

he
commanded
there
a
legion
of
mulattoes
according

of
more
than
eight
hundred
men
and
saved
the
army
after
the
useless
assault
on
the
fortifications
by
bravely
covering
the
retreat
it
was
this
legion
that
formed
the
connecting
link
between
the
siege
of

and
the
wide
development
of
republican
liberty
on
the
western
continent
which
followed
early
in

in
order
to
show
this
connection
and
the
sequences
it
will
be
necessary
to
sketch
in
brief
the
history
of
this
remarkable
body
of
men
especially
that
of
the
prominent
individuals
who
distinguished
themselves
at
savannah
in
the
french
colony
of
saint

in
a
state
of

the
population
then
consisting
of

and
black
freedmen
affranchis
and

received
orders
to
recruit
men
from
saint

for
the
auxiliary
army
and
there
being
no
question
of
color
raised
received
into
the
service
a
legion
of
colored
freedmen
there
had
been
for
years
a
colored
militia
in
saint
domingo
and
as
early
as
the
marquis
de
chateau
morant
then
governor
of
the
colony
made
one
vincent
the
of
all
the
colored
militia
in
the
vicinity
of
the
cape
this
captain
vincent
died
in
at
the
reputed
age
of
years
he
was
certainly
of
great
age
for
he
had
been
in
the
siege
of
carthegenia
in
was
taken
prisoner
afterwards
liberated
by
exchange
and
presented
to
louis

and
fought
in
the
german
war
under
villars
moreau
de
mery
in
his
description
of
vincent
incidentally
mentions
the
savannah
expedition
he
says
i
saw
him
vincent
the
year
preceding
his
death
recalling
his
ancient
prowess
to
the
men
of
color
who
were
enrolling
themselves
for
the
expedition
to
savannah
and
showing
in
his
descendants
who
were
among
the
first
to
offer
themselves
that
he
had
transmitted
his
valor
vincent
the
good
captain
vincent
had
a
most
pleasing
countenance
and
the
contrast
of
his
black
skin
with
his
white
hair
produced
an
effect
that
always
commanded
respect

the
haytian
historian
enclus
robin
says
when
the
call
for
volunteers
reached
saint
domingo
eight
hundred
young
freedmen
blacks
and
mulattoes
offered
themselves
to
take
part
in
the
expedition
that
they
went
and
fought
valiantly
and
returned
to
saint
domingo
covered
with
glory
madiou
another
haytian
historian
of
the
highest
respectability
says
a
crowd
of
young
men
black
and
colored
enlisted
with
the
french
troops
and
left
for
the
continent
they
covered
themselves
with
glory
in
the
siege
of
savannah
under
the
orders

count
what
effect
this
experience
had
upon
these
volunteers
may
be
inferred
from
their
subsequent
history
robin
says
these
men
who
contributed
their
mite
toward
american
independence
had
still
their
mothers
and
sisters
in
slavery
and
they
themselves
were
subject
to
humiliating
discriminations
should
not

have
expected
from
that
very
moment
that
they
would
soon
use
in
their
own
cause
those
very
arms
which
they
had
learned
so
well
to
use
in
the
interests
of

influence
hayti
became
the

the
connection
between
the
siege
of

and
the
independence
of

is
traced
both
as
to
its
spirit
and
physically
through
the

on
that
occasion
saved
the

how
this

is
traced

i
will
allow
a
haytian
statesman
and
man
of
letters
honored
both
at
home
and
abroad
to
relate
i
translate
from
a
work
published
in
paris
in
the
illustrious
bolivar
liberator
and
founder
of
five
republics
in
south
america
undertook
in
his
great
work
of
shaking
off
the
yoke
of
spain
and
of
securing
the
independence
of
those
immense
countries
which
swelled
the
pride
of
the
catholic
crown
but
failed
stripped
of
all
resources
he
took
flight
and
repaired
to
jamaica
where
he
implored
in
vain
of
the
governor
of
that
island
the
help
of
england
almost
in
despair
and
without
means
he
resolved
to
visit
hayti
and
appeal
to
the
generosity
of
the
black
republic
for
the
help
necessary
to
again
undertake
that
work
of
liberation
which
had
gone
to
pieces
in
his
hands
never
was
there
a
more
solemn
hour
for
any
man
and
that
man
the
representative
of
the
destiny
of
south
america
could
he
hope
for
success
after
the
english
who
had
every
interest
in
the
destruction
of
spanish
colonial
power
had
treated
him
with
so
much
indifference
could
he
hope
that
a
nation
weak
with
microscopic
territory
and
still
guarding
anxiously
its
own
independence
would
risk
itself
in
an
enterprise
hazardous
as
the
one
he
represented
full
of
doubt
he
came
but
petion
gave
him
a
most
cordial
welcome
taking
the
precautions
that
a
legitimate
sentiment
of
prudence
dictated
at
that
delicate
moment
of
our
national
existence
the
government
of
put
to
the
disposition
of
the
hero
of
boyaca
and
carabobo
all
the
elements
of
which
he
had
need
and
bolivar
needed
everything
men
arms
and
money
were
generously
given
him
petion
did
not
wish
to
act
openly
for
fear
of
compromising
himself
with
the
spanish
government
it
was
arranged
that
the
men
should
embark
secretly
as
volunteers
and
that
no
mention
of
hayti
should
ever
be
made
in
any
official
act

the

unquestionably
the
proud

distinction
of
being
the
physical

that
bore
away
from
our

the
sacred
fire
of

to
rekindle
it

for

let

here
say
that
i
never

such

by

they
fought
like
veterans
with

coolness

valor
that

they
preserved
their

the

in

they
never

too

recruited
among

of

many
of
them
coming
from

it

for

without

rather
than

the
question
of

was
settled
in

for
all

every

indeed
every
man
in

except
the

now

the
pay
of
his
grade
without

to
color

or

by
the
time
these
lines
reach

it
is
to
be

will
be
lifted
from
his
exceptional

all

served
in

army
of
the

during
the
war
of
the
rebellion
and
the
losses
from
their
ranks
of
men
killed
in
battle
were
as
heavy
as
from
the
white
troops
their
bravery
was
everywhere
recognized
and
in
the
short
time
in
which
they
were
employed
several
rose
to
commissions
perhaps
the
most
notable
act
performed
by
a
colored
american
during
the
war
was
the
capture
and
delivery
to
the
united
states
forces
of
the
rebel
steamer
planter
by
robert
smalls
of
charleston
smalls
was
employed
as
pilot
on
the

a
rebel
transport
and
was
entirely
familiar
with
the
harbors
and
inlets
of
which
there
are
many
on
the
south
atlantic
coast
on
may
the
planter
came
to
her
wharf
in
charleston
and
at
night
all
the
white
officers
went
ashore
leaving
a
colored
crew
of
eight
men
on
board
in

of
smalls
smalls
hastily
got
his

on

at
on
the
morning
of

out
into
the
harbor
passing
the
confederate
forts
by
giving
the
proper
signals
and
when
fairly
out
of
reach
as
daylight
came
he
ran
up
the
stars
and
stripes
and
headed
his
course
directly
toward
the
union
fleet
into
whose
hands
he
soon
surrendered
himself
and
his
ship
the
act
caused
much
favorable
comment
and
robert
smalls
became
quite
a
hero
his
subsequent
career
has
been
in
keeping
with
the
high
promise
indicated
by
this
bold
dash
for
liberty
and
his
name
has
received
additional
lustre
from
gallant
services
performed
in
the
war
after
and
in
positions
of
distinguished
honor
and
responsibility
in
civil
life
the
planter
after
being
accepted
by
the
united
states
became
a
despatch
boat
and

demonstrating
by
skill
and
bravery
his
fitness
for
the
position
was
finally
as
an
act
of
imperative
justice
made
her
commander
with
the
close
of
the
revolutionary
war
the
prejudice
against
a
standing
army
was
so
great
that
the
army
was
reduced
to
scarce
six
hundred
men
and
the
negro
as
a
soldier
dropped
out
of
existence
when
the
war
of
closed
sentiment
with
regard
to
the
army
had
made
but
little
advancement
and
consequently
no
place
in
the
service
was
left
for
negro
soldiers
in
the
navy
the
negro
still
lingered
doing
service
in
the
lower
grades
and
keeping
up
the
succession
from
the
black
heroes
of
and
when
the
war
of
the
rebellion
closed
the
country
had
advanced
so
far
as
to
see
both
the
necessity
of
a
standing
army
and
the
fitness
of
the
negro
to
form
a
part
of
the
army
and
from
this
position
it
has
never
receded
and
if
the
lessons
of
the
cuban
campaign
are
rightly
heeded
it
is
not
likely
to
recede
therefrom
the
value
of
the
regular
army
and
of
the
black
regular
were
both
proven
to
an
absolute
demonstration
in
that
thin
line
of

that
compelled

of

adding
eight
new

to
the
nineteen
regiments
of

and
six
of
calvary
of
which
those
arms
of
the
regular

were
at
that
time
composed
thus
making
the
permanent
establishment
to
consist
of
five

of

and
ten
of

of
the
eight
new

the
four
proposed
for

arm
two
were
to

the

was
empowered
by
the

also
to
appoint
a

for
each
of
the
six

of

under

law
the

to
this

the

between
the

the
which
was
the
lowest
number
borne
by

were
filled
in
by

in

of

the
present

five
of
artillery

the
number
of
men
in
a
company
and
the
number
of
companies
in
a
regiment
have
varied
greatly
within
the
past
few
months
just
previous
to
the
breaking
out
of
the
war
a
regiment
of
infantry
consisted
of
eight
companies
of
about
sixty
men
each
and
two
skeletonized
companies
and
the

the
whole
organization
carrying
about
five
hundred

now
a

of

consists
of
twelve
companies
of
men
each
and
with
the
staff
numbers
twelve
hundred
and
men
since
or
for
a
period
of
thirty
years
the
colored
american
has
been
represented
in
the
regular
army
by
these
four
regiments
and
during
this
time
these
regiments
have
borne
more
than
their
proportionate
share
in
hard
frontier
service
including
all
sorts
of
indian
campaigning
and
much
severe
guard
and
fatigue
duty
the
men
have
conducted
themselves
so
worthily
as
to
receive
from
the
highest
military
authority
the
credit
of
being
among
our
best
troops
general
miles
and
general
merritt
with
others
who
were
active
leaders
in
the
indian
wars
of
the
west
have
been
unstinting
in
their
praise
of
the
valor
and
skill
of
colored
soldiers
they
proved
themselves
not
only
good
individual
fighters
but
in
some
instances
officers
exhibited
marked
coolness
and
ability
in
command
from
to
the
beginning
of
the
war
there
were
in
the
regular
army
at
some
time
as
commissioned
officers
the
following
colored
men
all
from
west
point
all
serving
with
the
cavalry
and
none
rising
higher
than
viz
john
alexander
flipper
and
charles
young
flipper
was
dismissed
alexander
died
and
young
became
major
in
the
volunteer
service
and
was
placed
in
command
of
the
ninth
battalion
of
ohio
volunteers
discharging
the
duties
of
his
position
in
such
a
manner
as
to
command
general
satisfaction
from
his
superior
officers
these
colored
men
while
cadets
at
west
point
endured
hardships
disgraceful
to
their
country
and
when
entering
the
army
were
not
given
that
cordial
welcome
by
their
brother
officers
becoming
an
officer
and
gentleman
both
to
give
and
to
receive
of
course
there
were
some
noble
exceptions
and
this
class
of
officers
seems
to
be
steadily
increasing
so
that
now
it
is
no
longer
necessary
even
on
the
ground
of
expediency
to
strive
to
adhere
to
the
rule
of
only
white
men
for
army
officers
of
alexander
and
young
it
can
be
said
they
have
acquitted
themselves
well
the
former
enjoying
the
confidence
and
esteem
of
his
associates
up
to
the
time
of
his
early
death
an
event
which
caused
deep
regret
and
the
latter
so
impressing
the
governor
of
his
state
and
the
president
as
to
secure
for
himself
the
responsible
position
which
he
at
the
time
of
this
writing
so
worthily
fills
besides
these
line
officers
five
colored
chaplains
have
been
appointed
all
of
whom
have
served
successfully
one
however
being
dismissed
by
after
many
years
of
really
meritorious
service
an
event
to
be
regretted
but
by
no
means
without
parallel
brief
sketches
of
the
history
of
these
four
colored
regiments
as
well
as
of
the
others
have
been
recently
made
by
members
of
them
and
published
in
the
journal
of
the
military
service
institution
and
subsequently
in
a
large
and
beautiful
volume
edited
by
theo
rodenbough
and
major
william
haskin
published
by
the
institution
and
designated
the
army
of
the
united
states
a
most
valuable
book
of
reference
from
the
sketches
contained
therein
the
following
summary
is
given
the
infantry
was
organized
as
we
have
seen
from
the
and
regiments
these
two
regiments
being
at
the
time
distributed
in
new
mexico
louisiana
and
texas
and
the
regiment
remained
in
texas
from
the
time
of
its
organization
in
until
its
first
was
william
shafter
it
was
from
this
regiment
and
the
tenth
cavalry
that
the
escort
of
paymaster
wham
was
selected
which
made
so
brave
a
stand
against
a
band
of
robbers
that
attacked
the
paymaster
that
several
of
them
were
given
medals
for
distinguished
gallantry
and
others
certificates
of
merit
the
infantry
was
organized
in
new
orleans
out
of
the
that
was
brought
from
north
carolina
for
that
purpose
and
the
that
was
then
in
louisiana
it
was
organized
during
the
month
of
april
and
early
in
moved
to
texas
where
it
remained
ten
years
in
it
moved
to
the
department
of
dakota
and
remained
in
the
northwest
until
it
took
the
road
for
the
cuban
war
the
ninth
cavalry
was
organized
in
new
orleans
during
the
winter
of
its
first
colonel
was
edward
hatch
and
its
first
wesley
merritt
from
to
it
was
in
almost
constant
indian
warfare
distinguishing
itself
by
daring
and
hardihood
from
to
the
opening
of
the
cuban
war
it
remained
in
utah
and
nebraska
engaging
in
but
one
important
campaign
that
against
hostile
sioux
during
the
winter
of
in
which
says
the
historian
the
regiment
was
the
first
in
the
field
in
november
and
the
last
to
leave
late
in
the
following
march
after
spending
the
winter
the
latter
part
of
which
was
terrible
in
its
severity
under
canvas
the
tenth
calvary
was
organized
under
the
same
law
as
was
the
ninth
and
at
the
same
time
its
place
of
rendezvous
was
fort
leavenworth
kansas
and
its
first
colonel
benjamin
grierson
this
regiment
was
the
backbone
of
the
geronimo
campaign
force
and
it
finally
succeeded
in
the
capture
of
that
wily
warrior
the
regiment
remained
in
the
southwest
until
when
it
moved
to
montana
and
remained
there
until
ordered
to
chickamauga
for
the
war
these
four
regiments
were
finely
officered
well
drilled
and
well
experienced
in
camp
and
field
particularly
the
cavalry
regiments
and
it
was
of
them
that
general
merritt
said
i
have
always
found
them
brave
in
battle
with
such
training
and
experience
they
were
well
fitted
to
take
their
place
in
that
selected
host
of
fighting
men
which
afterwards
became
the
fifth
army
corps
placed
under
command
of
william
shafter
the
first
of
the
infantry
when
the
news
of
the
blowing
up
of
our
great
battleship
maine
in
the
harbor
of
havana
with
the
almost
total
loss
of
her
crew
flashed
over
the
country
carrying
sadness
to
hundreds
of
homes
and
arousing
feelings
of
deepest
indignation
whether
justly
or
unjustly
it
was
easy
to
predict
that
we
should
soon
be
involved
in
war
with
spain
the
cuban
question
already
chronic
had
by
speeches
of
senators
thurston
and
proctor
been
brought
to
such
a
stage
of
aggravation
that
it
needed
only
an
incident
to
set
the
war
element
in
motion
that
incident
was
furnished
by
the
destruction
of
the
maine
thenceforth
there
was
no
power
in
the
land
sufficient
to
curb
the
rapidly
swelling
tide
of
popular
hate
which
manifested
itself
in
the
but
truly
significant
mottoes
remember
the
maine
avenge
the
maine
and
to
hell
with
spain
these
were
the
outbreathings
of
popular
fury
and
they
represented
a
spirit
quite
like
that
of
the
mob
which
was
not
to
be
yielded
to
implicitly
but
which
could
not
be
directly
opposed
the
president
did
all
in
his
power
to
stay
this
element
of
our
population
and
to
lead
the
country
to
a
more
befitting
attitude
he
and
his
advisers
argued
that
spain
was
to
be
resisted
and
fought
if
necessary
not
on
account
of
the
maine
not
in
the
spirit
of
revenge
but
in
the
interest
of
humanity
and
upon
principles
sanctioned
even
by
our
holy
religion
on
behalf
of
the
starving
reconcentrados
and
in
aid
of
the
noble
cuban
patriot
we
might
justly
arm
and
equip
ourselves
for
the
purpose
of
driving
spanish
rule
from
the
western
hemisphere
this
view
appealed
to
all
lovers
of
freedom
to
all
true
patriots
and
to
the
christian
and
philanthropist
it
also
afforded
a
superb
opportunity
for
the
old
leaders
in
the
south
who
were
not
entirely
relieved
from
the
taint
of
secession
to
come
out
and
reconsecrate
themselves
to
the
country
and
her
flag
hence
southern
statesmen
who
were
utterly
opposed
to
negroes
or
colored
men
having
any
share
in
ruling
at
home
became
very
enthusiastic
over
the
aspirations
of
the
colored
cuban
patriots
and
soldiers
the
supporters
followers
and
in
a
sense
devotees
of
maceo
and
gomez
were
worthy
of
our
aid
the
same
men
actuated
by
the
same
principles
in
the
carolinas
in
louisiana
or
in
mississippi
would
have
been
pronounced
by
the
same
authorities
worthy
of
death
the
nation
was
however
led
into
war
simply
to
liberate
cuba
from
the
iniquitous
and
cruel
yoke
of
spain
and
to
save
thousands
of
impoverished
cubans
from
death
by
starvation
great
care
was
taken
not
to
recognize
the
cuban
government
in
any
form
and
it
seemed
to
be
understood
that
we
were
to
do
the
fighting
both
with
our
navy
and
our
army
the
cubans
being
invited
to
with
us
rather
than
that
we
should
with
them
we
were
to
be
the
liberators
and
saviors
of
a
people
crushed
to
the
very
gates
of
death
such
was
the
platform
upon
which
our
nation
stood
before
the
world
when
the
first
orders
went
forth
for
the
mobilization
of
its
forces
for
war
it
was
a
position
worthy
our
history
and
character
and
gave
to
our
national
flag
a
prouder
meaning
than
ever
its
character
as
the
emblem
of
freedom
shone
out
with
brilliancy
amid
the
concourse
of
nations
while
there
was
such
a
clamor
for
war
in
the
newspapers
and
in
the
public
speeches
of
statesmen
both
in
and
out
of
congress
it
is
remarkable
that
the
utmost
serenity
prevailed
in
the
army
officers
and
men
were
ready
to
fight
if
the
stern
necessity
came
but
they
were
not
so
eager
for
the
as
were
the
numerous
editors
whose
papers
were
getting
out
extras
every
it
was
argued
by
the
officers
of
rank
that
the
maine
incident
added
nothing
whatever
to
the
cuban
question
that
it
did
not
involve
the
spanish
government
that
the
whole
subject
might
well
be
left
to
arbitration
and
full
respect
should
be
given
to
spain
disclaimer
it
was
also
held
that
to
rush
into
a
war
in
order
to
prevent
a
few
people
from
starving
might
not
relieve
them
and
at
the
same
time
would
certainly
cost
the
lives
of
many
innocent
men
spain
was
revising
her
policy
and
the
benevolence
of
the
united
states
would
soon
bring
bread
to
the
door
of
every
needy
cuban
such
remarks
and
arguments
as
these
were
used
by
men
who
had
fought
through
one
war
and
were
ready
to
fight
through
another
if
they
must
but
who
were
willing
to
go
to
any
reasonable
length
to
prevent
it
and
yet
the
men
who
used
such
arguments
beforehand
and
manifested
such
a
shrinking
from
carnage
are
among
those
to
whom
the
short
spanish
war
brought
distinction
and
promotion
to
their
honor
be
it
said
that
the
war
which
gave
them
fresh
laurels
was
in
no
sense
brought
about
through
their
instigation
as
chaplain
of
the
infantry
stationed
with
the
headquarters
of
the
regiment
at
fort
missoula
where
we
had
been
for
ten
years
the
call
for
the
war
met
me
in
the
midst
of
my
preparations
for
easter
service
one
young
man
then
private
thomas
butler
who
was
practicing
a
difficult
solo
for
the
occasion
before
the
year
closed
became
a
second
lieutenant
having
distinguished
himself
in
battle
the
janitor
who
cared
for
my
singing
books
and
who
was
my
chief
school
teacher
private
french
payne
always
polite
and
everywhere
efficient
met
his
death
from
a
spanish
bullet
while
on
the
reserve
before
bloody
el
caney
it
was
on
a
bright
day
during
the
latter
part
of
march
and
near
the
close
of
the
day
as
i
was
looking
out
of
the
front
window
of
my
quarters
that
i
saw
the
trumpeter
of
the
guard
come
out
of
the
adjutant
office
with
a
dispatch
in
his
hand
and
start
on
a
brisk
run
toward
the
quarters
of
the
commanding
officer
i
immediately
divined
what
was
in
the
wind
but
kept
quiet
in
a
few
minutes
call
was
sounded
and
all
the
officers
of
the
post
hastened
to
the
administration
building
to
learn
the
news
when
all
were
assembled
the
commanding
officer
desired
to
know
of
each
company
officer
how
much
time
he
would
need
to
have
his
company
ready
to
move
from
the
post
to
go
to
a
permanent
station
elsewhere
and
from
all
officers
how
much
time
they
would
require
to
have
their
families
ready
to
quit
the
station
the
answers
generally
were
that
all
could
be
ready
within
a
week
it
was
finally
agreed
however
to
ask
for
ten
days
immediately
the
work
of
preparation
began
although
none
knew
where
the
regiment
was
to
go
at
this
time
the
order
so
far
as
it
was
understood
at
the
garrison
was
that
two
companies
were
to
go
to
key
west
florida
and
the
other
companies
of
the
regiment
to
dry
tortugas
one
officer
lieutenant
caldell
early
saw
through
the
haze
and
said
it
means
that
we
will
all
eventually
land
in
cuba
while
we
were
packing
rumors
flew
through
the
garrison
as
indeed
through
the
country
thick
and
fast
and
our
destination
was
changed
three
or
four
times
a
day
one
hour
we
would
be
going
to
key
west
the
next
to
augustine
the
next
to
tortugas
in
this
confusion
i
asked
an
old
frontier
officer
where
he
thought
we
would
really
go
regarding
himself
as
an
indicator
and
always
capable
of
seeing
the
amusing
side
of
a
subject
he
replied
i
toward
texas
such
was
the
state
of
uncertainty
as
to
destination
and
yet
all
the
time
the
greatest
activity
prevailed
in
making
ready
for
departure
finally
definite
orders
came
that
we
were
to
store
our
furniture
in
the
large
gymnasium
hall
at
the
post
and
prepare
to
go
in
camp
at
chickamauga
park
georgia
our
regiment
was
at
the
time
stationed
as
follows
headquarters
four
companies
and
the
band
at
fort
missoula
two
companies
at
fort
harrison
near
helena
and
two
companies
at
fort
assinniboine
all
in
montana
the
arrangements
contemplated
moving
the
regiment
in
two
sections
one
composed
of
the
missoula
troops
to
go
over
the
northern
pacific
railroad
the
other
of
the
fort
harrison
and
fort
assinniboine
troops
to
go
over
the
great
northern
railroad
all
to
arrive
in
paul
about
the
same
time
on
the
of
april
easter
sunday
the
battalion
at
fort
missoula
marched
out
of
post
quite
early
in
the
morning
and
at
bitter
root
station
took
the
cars
for
their
long
journey
officers
and
men
were
all
furnished
sleeping
accommodations
on
the
train
arriving
in
the
city
of
missoula
for
the
gratification
of
the
citizens
and
perhaps
to
avoid
strain
on
the
bridge
crossing
the
missoula
river
the
men
were
disembarked
from
the
train
and
marched
through
the
principal
streets
to
the
depot
the
citizens
generally
turning
out
to
see
them
off
many
were
the
compliments
paid
officers
and
men
by
the
good
people
of
missoula
none
perhaps
more
pleasing
than
that
furnished
by
a
written
testimonial
to
the
regret
experienced
at
the
departure
of
the
regiment
signed
by
all
the
ministers
of
the
city
as
the
was
the
first
regiment
to
move
in
the
preparation
for
war
its
progress
from
montana
to
chickamauga
was
a
marked
event
attracting
the
attention
of
both
the
daily
and
illustrated
press
all
along
the
route
they
were
greeted
with
enthusiastic
crowds
who
fully
believed
the
war
with
spain
had
begun
in
paul
in
chicago
in
terre
haute
in
nashville
and
in
chattanooga
the
crowds
assembled
to
greet
the
black
regulars
who
were
first
to
bear
forward
the
starry
banner
of
union
and
freedom
against
a
foreign
foe
what
could
be
more
significant
or
more
fitting
than
that
these
black
soldiers
drilled
up
to
the
highest
standard
of
modern
warfare
cool
brave
and
confident
themselves
a
proof
of
american
liberty
should
be
called
first
to
the
front
in
a
war
against
oppression
their
martial
tread
and
fearless
bearing
proclaimed
what
the
better
genius
of
our
great
government
meant
for
all
men
dwelling
beneath
the
protection
of
its
honored
flag
as
the
infantry
was
the
first
regiment
to
leave
its
station
so
six
companies
of
it
were
first
to
go
into
camp
on
the
historic
grounds
of
chickamauga
two
companies
were
separated
from
the
regiment
at
chattanooga
and
forwarded
to
key
west
where
they
took
station
under
the
command
of
daggett
the
remaining
six
companies
under
command
of
colonel
burt
were
conducted
by
general
boynton
to
a
choice
spot
on
the
grounds
where
they
pitched
camp
their
tents
being
the
first
erected
in
that
mobilization
of
troops
which
preceded
the
cuban
invasion
and
theirs
being
really
the
first
camp
of
the
war
soon
came
the
ninth
cavalry
the
tenth
cavalry
and
the
infantry
while
these
were
assembling
there
arrived
on
the
ground
also
many
white
regiments
cavalry
artillery
and
infantry
and
it
was
pleasing
to
see
the
fraternity
that
prevailed
among
black
and
white
regulars
this
was
especially
noticeable
between
the
and
twelfth
in
brigading
the
regiments
no
attention
whatever
was
paid
to
the
race
or
color
of
the
men
the
black
infantry
regiments
were
placed
in
two
brigades
and
the
black
cavalry
likewise
and
they
can
be
followed
through
the
fortunes
of
the
war
in
the
official
records
by
their
regimental
numbers
during
their
stay
in
chickamauga
and
at
key
west
and
tampa
the
southern
newspapers
indulged
in
considerable
malicious
abuse
of
colored
soldiers
and
some
people
of
this
section
made
complaints
of
their
conduct
but
the
previous
good
character
of
the
regiments
and
the
violent
tone
of
the
accusations
taken
together
with
the
prejudices
of
the
southern
people
prevented
their
complaints
from
having
very
great
weight
the
black
soldiers
held
their
place
in
the
army
chosen
for
the
invasion
of
cuba
and
for
that
purpose
were
soon
ordered
to
assemble
in
tampa
from
the
of
april
when
the
war
movement
began
with
the
march
of
the
infantry
out
of
its
montana
stations
until
june
when
the
army
of
invasion
cleared
tampa
for
cuba
not
quite
two
months
the
whole
energy
of
the
war
department
had
been
employed
in
preparing
the
army
for
the
work
before
it
the
beginning
of
the
war
is
officially
given
as
april
from
which
time
onward
it
was
declared
a
state
of
war
existed
between
spain
and
the
united
states
but
warlike
movements
on
our
side
were
begun
fully
ten
days
earlier
and
begun
with
a
grim
definiteness
that
presaged
much
more
than
a
practice
march
or
spring
manoeuver
after
arriving
at
chickamauga
all
heavy
baggage
was
shipped
away
for
storage
and
all
officers
and
men
were
required
to
reduce
their
field
equipage
to
the
minimum
the
object
being
to
have
the
least
possible
amount
of
luggage
in
order
that
the
greatest
possible
amount
of
fighting
material
might
be
carried
even
with
all
this
preparation
going
on
some
officers
were
indulging
the
hope
that
the
troops
might
remain
in
camps
perfecting
themselves
in
drill
until
september
or
october
before
they
should
be
called
upon
to
embark
for
cuba
this
however
was
not
to
be
and
it
is
perhaps
well
that
it
was
not
as
the
suffering
and
mortality
in
the
home
camps
were
almost
equal
to
that
endured
by
the
troops
in
cuba
the
suffering
at
home
also
seemed
more
disheartening
because
it
appeared
to
be
useless
and
could
not
be
charged
to
any
important
changes
in
conditions
or
climate
it
was
perhaps
in
the
interest
of
humanity
that
this
war
waged
for
humanity
sake
should
have
been
pushed
forward
from
its
first
step
to
its
last
with
the
greatest
possible
dispatch
and
that
just
enough
men
on
our
side
were
sent
to
the
front
and
no
more
it
is
still
a
good
saying
that
all
is
well
that
ends
well

the
spot
where
some
lofty
hero
gave
up
his

the
whole
park
is
a
monument
however
and
its
definite
purpose
is
to
preserve
and
suitably
mark
for
historical
and
professional
military
study
the
fields
of
some
of
the
most
remarkable
manoeuvres
and
most
brilliant
fighting
in
the
war
of
the
rebellion
the
battles
commemorated
by
this
great
park
are
those
of
chickamauga
fought
on
september
and
the
battles
around
chattanooga
november
the
battle
of
chickamauga
was
fought
by
the
army
of
the
cumberland
commanded
by
rosecrans
on
the
union
side
and
the
army
of
tennessee
commanded
by
general
braxton
bragg
on
the
side
of
the
confederates
the
total
effective
strength
of
the
union
forces
in
this
battle
was
little
less
than
men
that
of
the
confederates
about
the
total
union
loss
was
men
a
number
about
equal
to
the
army
led
by
shatter
against
santiago
of
the
number
reported
as
lost
were
killed
or
as
many
as
were
lost
in
killed
wounded
and
missing
in
the
cuban
campaign
the
confederate
losses
were
being
killed
making
on
both
sides
a
total
killed
of
equivalent
to
the
entire
voting
population
of
a
city
of
over
twenty
thousand
inhabitants
general
grant
who
commanded
the
union
forces
in
the
battles
around
chattanooga
thus
sums
up
the
results
in
this
battle
the
union
army
numbered
in
round
figures
about
men
we
lost
killed
wounded
and
captured
or
missing
the
rebel
loss
was
much
greater
in
the
aggregate
as
we
captured
and
sent
north
to
be
rationed
there
over
prisoners
forty
pieces
of
artillery
over
seven
thousand
stand
of
small
arms
many
caissons
artillery
wagons
and
baggage
wagons
fell
into
our
hands
the
probabilities
are
that
our
loss
in
killed
was
the
heavier
as
we
were
the
attacking
party
the
enemy
reported
his
loss
in
killed
at
but
as
he
reported
his
missing
at
while
we
held
over
of
them
as
prisoners
and
there
must
have
been
hundreds
if
not
thousands
who
deserted
but
little
reliance
can
be
placed
upon
this
report
in
the
battle
of
chickamauga
when
of
the
union
army
had
crumbled
into
wild
confusion
and
rosecrans
was
intent
only
on
saving
the
fragments
general
thomas
who
had
commanded
the
federal
left
during
the
two
days
conflict
and
had
borne
the
brunt
of
the
fight
still
held
his
position
to
him
general
james
garfield
reported
general
gordon
granger
without
orders
brought
up
the
reserves
and
thomas
replacing
his
lines
held
the
ground
until
nightfall
when
he
was
joined
by
sheridan
bragg
won
and
held
the
field
but
thomas
effectually
blocked
his
way
to
chattanooga
securing
to
himself
immediately
the
title
of
the
rock
of
chickamauga
his
wonderful
resolution
stayed
the
tide
of
a
victory
dearly
bought
and
actually
won
and
prevented
the
victors
from
grasping
the
object
for
which
they
had
fought
in
honor
of
this
stubborn
valor
and
in
recognition
of
this
high
expression
of
american
tenacity
the
camp
established
in
chickamauga
park
by
the
assembling
army
was
called
camp
george
thomas
the
stay
of
the
colored
regulars
at
camp
george
thomas
was
short
but
it
was
long
enough
for
certain
newspapers
of
chattanooga
to
give
expression
to
their
dislike
to
negro
troops
in
general
and
to
those
in
their
proximity
especially
the
washington
post
also
ever
faithful
to
its
unsavory
trust
lent
its
influence
to
this
work
of
defamation
the
leading
papers
however
both
of
chattanooga
and
the
south
generally
spoke
out
in
rather
conciliatory
and
patronizing
tones
and
sought
to
restrain
the
people
of
their
section
from
compromising
their
brilliant
display
of
patriotism
by
contemptuous
flings
at
the
nation
true
and
tried
soldiers
the
infantry
and
the
cavalry
soon
left
for
tampa
florida
whither
they
were
followed
by
the
cavalry
and
the
infantry
thus
bringing
the
entire
colored
element
of
the
army
together
to
prepare
for
embarkation
the
work
done
at
tampa
is
thus
described
officially
by
daggett
in
general
orders
addressed
to
the
infantry
which
he
at
that
time
commanded
on
august
with
headquarters
near
santiago
after
the
great
battles
had
been
fought
and
won
he
thus
reviewed
the
work
of
the
regiment
gathered
from
three
different
stations
many
of
you
strangers
to
each
other
you
assembled
as
a
regiment
for
the
first
time
in
more
than
years
on
may
at
tampa
florida
there
you
endeavored
to
solidify
and
prepare
yourselves
as
far
as
the
oppressive
weather
would
permit
for
the
work
that
appeared
to
be
before
you
what
is
here
said
of
the
might
have
been
said
with
equal
propriety
of
all
the
regular
troops
assembled
at
tampa
in
the
meantime
events
were
ripening
with
great
rapidity
the
historic
first
gun
had
been
fired
and
the
united
states
made
the
first
naval
capture
of
the
war
on
april
the
coast
trader
buena
ventura
having
surrendered
to
the
american
gunboat
nashville
on
the
same
day
the
blockade
of
cuban
ports
was
declared
and
on
the
day
following
a
call
was
issued
for
volunteers
on
may
the
news
that
a
spanish
fleet
under
command
of
admiral
cervera
had
arrived
at
santiago
was
officially
confirmed
and
a
speedy
movement
to
cuba
was
determined
upon
almost
the
entire
regular
army
with
several
volunteer
regiments
were
organized
into
an
army
of
invasion
and
placed
under
the
command
of
shafter
with
orders
to
prepare
immediately
for
embarkation
and
on
the
and
of
june
this
army
went
on
board
the
transports
for
seven
days
the
troops
lay
cooped
up
on
the
vessels
awaiting
orders
to
sail
a
rumor
having
gained
circulation
that
certain
spanish
gunboats
were
hovering
around
in
cuban
waters
awaiting
to
swoop
down
upon
the
crowded
transports
while
the
army
of
invasion
was
sweltering
in
the
ships
lying
at
anchor
off
port
tampa
a
small
body
of
american
marines
made
a
landing
at
guantanamo
and
on
june
fought
the
first
battle
between
americans
and
spaniards
on
cuban
soil
in
this
first
battle
four
americans
were
killed
the
next
day
june
general
shafter
army
containing
the
four
colored
regiments
excepting
those
left
behind
to
guard
property
sailed
for
cuba
the
whole
number
of
men
and
officers
in
the
expedition
including
those
that
came
on
transports
from
mobile
amounted
to
about
seventeen
thousand
men
loaded
on
transports
the
colored
regiments
were
assigned
to
brigades
as
follows
the
ninth
cavalry
was
joined
with
the
third
and
sixth
cavalry
and
placed
under
command
of
colonel
carrol
the
tenth
cavalry
was
joined
with
the
rough
riders
and
first
regular
cavalry
and
fell
under
the
command
of
general
young
the
infantry
was
joined
with
the
ninth
and
thirteenth
infantry
and
the
brigade
placed
under
command
of
colonel
worth
and
assigned
to
the
division
commanded
by
general
kent
who
until
his
promotion
as
of
volunteers
had
been
colonel
of
the
the
infantry
was
joined
with
the
first
and
fourth
infantry
and
the
brigade
placed
under
command
of
colonel
evans
miles
who
had
formerly
been
major
of
the
all
of
the
colored
regiments
were
thus
happily
placed
so
that
they
should
be
in
pleasant
soldierly
competition
with
the
very
best
troops
the
country
ever
put
in
the
field
and
this
arrangement
at
the
start
proves
how
strongly
the
black
regular
had
entrenched
himself
in
the
confidence
of
our
great
commanders
thus
sailed
from
port
tampa
the
major
part
of
our
little
army
of
trained
and
seasoned
soldiers
representative
of
the
skill
and
daring
of
the
nation
in
physique
almost
every
man
was
an
athlete
and
while
but
few
had
seen
actual
war
beyond
an
occasional
skirmish
with
indians
all
excepting
the
few
volunteers
had
passed
through
a
long
process
of
training
in
the
various
details
of
marching
camping
and
fighting
in
their
annual
exercises
in
minor
tactics
for
the
first
time
in
history
the
nation
is
going
abroad
by
its
army
to
occupy
the
territory
of
a
foreign
foe
in
a
contest
with
a
power
the
unsuccessful
invasions
of
canada
during
the
revolutionary
war
and
the
war
of
can
hardly
be
brought
in
comparison
with
this
movement
over
sea
the
departure
of
decatur
with
his
nine
ships
of
war
to
the
barbary
states
had
in
view
only
the
establishment
of
proper
civil
relations
between
those
petty
countries
and
the
united
states
the
sailing
of
general
shafter
army
was
only
one
movement
in
a
comprehensive
war
against
the
kingdom
of
spain
more
than
a
month
earlier
commodore
dewey
acting
under
orders
had
destroyed
a
fleet
of
eleven
war
ships
in
the
philippines
the
purpose
of
the
war
was
to
relieve
the
cubans
from
an
inhumane
warfare
with
their
mother
country
and
to
restore
to
that
unhappy
island
a
stable
government
in
harmony
with
the
ideas
of
liberty
and
justice
up
to
the
breaking
out
of
the
spanish
war
the
american
policy
with
respect
to
europe
had
been
one
of
isolation
some
efforts
had
been
made
to
consolidate
the
sentiment
of
the
western
world
but
it
had
never
been
successful
the
fraternity
of
the
american
republics
and
the
attempted
construction
of
a
policy
had
been
thus
far
unfulfilled
dreams
canada
was
much
nearer
to
the
united
states
geographically
and
socially
than
even
mexico
although
the
latter
is
a
republic
england
in
europe
was
nearer
than
brazil
the
day
came
in
when
the
united
states
could
no
longer
remain
in
political
seclusion
nor
bury
herself
in
an
impossible
federation
advice
against
becoming
involved
in
european
affairs
as
well
as
the
direct
corrollary
of
the
monroe
doctrine
were
to
be
laid
aside
and
the
united
states
was
to
speak
out
to
the
world
the
business
of
a
european
nation
had
become
our
business
in
the
face
of
all
the
world
we
resolved
to
invade
her
territory
in
the
interest
of
humanity
to
face
about
upon
our
own
traditions
and
dare
the
opinions
and
arms
of
the
world
by
openly
launching
upon
the
new
policy
of
armed
intervention
in
another
quarrel
while
the
troops
were
mobilizing
at
tampa
preparatory
to
embarking
for
cuba
the
question
came
up
as
to
why
there
were
no
colored
men
in
the
artillery
arm
of
the
service
and
the
answer
given
by
a
regular
army
officer
was
that
the
negro
had
not
brains
enough
for
the
management
of
heavy
guns
it
was
a
trifling
assertion
of
course
but
at
this
period
of
the
negro
history
it
must
not
be
allowed
to
pass
unnoticed
we
know
that
white
men
of
all
races
and
nationalities
can
serve
big
guns
and
if
the
negro
can
not
it
must
be
because
of
some
marked
difference
between
him
and
them
the
officer
said
it
was
a
difference
in
brains
a
mental
difference
just
how
the
problem
of
aiming
and
firing
a
big
gun
differs
from
that
of
aiming
and
firing
small
arms
is
not
so
easily
explained
in
both
the
questions
of
velocity
gravitation
wind
and
resistance
are
to
be
considered
and
these
are
largely
settled
by
mechanism
the
adjustment
of
which
is
readily
learned
hence
the
assumption
that
a
negro
can
not
learn
it
is
purely
gratuitous
several
of
the
best
rifle
shots
known
on
this
continent
are
negroes
and
it
was
a
negro
who
summerized
the
whole
philosophy
of
rifle
shooting
in
the
statement
that
it
all
consists
in
knowing
to
aim
and
to
pull
in
knowing
just
what
value
to
assign
to
gravitation
drift
of
the
bullet
and
force
of
the
wind
and
then
in
being
able
to
pull
the
trigger
of
the
piece
without
disturbing
the
aim
thus
judiciously
determined
this
includes
all
there
is
in
the
final
science
and
art
of
firing
a
rifle
if
the
negro
can
thus
master
the
revolver
the
carbine
and
the
rifle
why
may
he
not
master
the
field
piece
or
siege
gun
but
an
ounce
of
fact
in
such
things
is
worth
more
than
many
volumes
of
idle
speculation
and
it
is
remarkable
that
facts
so
recent
so
numerous
and
so
near
at
hand
should
escape
the
notice
of
those
who
question
the
negro
ability
to
serve
the
artillery
organizations
negro
artillery
both
light
and
heavy
fought
in
fifteen
battles
in
the
civil
war
with
average
effectiveness
and
some
of
those
who
fought
against
them
must
either
admit
the
value
of
the
negro
artilleryman
or
acknowledge
their
own
inefficiency
general
lee
failed
to
capture
a
negro
battery
after
making
most
vigorous
attempts
to
that
end
this
attempt
to
raise
a
doubt
as
to
the
negro
ability
to
serve
in
the
artillery
arm
is
akin
to
and
less
excusable
than
that
other
groundless
assertion
that
negro
officers
can
not
command
troops
an
assertion
which
in
this
country
amounts
to
saying
that
the
united
states
can
not
command
its
army
both
of
these
assertions
have
been
emphatically
answered
in
fact
the
former
as
shown
above
and
the
latter
as
will
be
shown
later
in
this
volume
these
assertions
are
only
temporary
covers
behind
which
discomfitted
and
retreating
prejudice
is
able
to
make
a
brief
stand
while
the
black
hero
of
five
hundred
marches
proudly
by
disdaining
to
lower
his
gun
to
fire
a
shot
on
a
foe
so
unworthy
when
the
second
massachusetts
volunteers
sent
up
their
hearty
cheers
of
welcome
to
the
gallant
old
as
that
solid
column
fresh
from
el
caney
swung
past
its
camp
i
remarked
to
sergeant
harris
of
the
those
men
think
you
are
soldiers
they
know
we
are
soldiers
was
his
reply
when
the
people
of
this
country
like
the
members
of
that
massachusetts
regiment
come
to
know
that
its
black
men
in
uniform
are
soldiers
plain
soldiers
with
the
same
interests
and
feelings
as
other
soldiers
of
as
much
value
to
the
government
and
entitled
from
it
to
the
same
attention
and
rewards
then
a
great
step
toward
the
solution
of
the
prodigious
problem
now
confronting
us
will
have
been
taken
i
had
often
heard
that
the
physique
of
the
men
of
our
regular
army
was
very
remarkable
but
the
first
time
i
saw
any
large
body
of
them
which
was
at
tampa
they
surpassed
my
highest
expectations
it
is
not
however
to
be
wondered
at
that
for
every
recruit
who
is
accepted
on
the
average
are
rejected
and
that
of
course
the
men
who
present
themselves
to
the
recruiting
officer
already
represent
a
physical
but
it
was
very
pleasant
to
see
and
be
assured
as
i
was
at
tampa
by
the
evidences
of
my
own
eyes
and
the
tape
measure
that
there
is
not
a
guard
regiment
of
either
the
russian
german
or
english
army
of
whose
remarkable
physique
we
have
heard
so
much
that
can
compare
physically
not
with
the
best
of
our
men
but
simply
with
the
average
of
the
men
of
our
regular
bonsal
footnotes
the
army
has
been
reorganized
since
see
register
my
experience
in
this
direction
since
the
war
is
beyond
that
of
any
officer
of
my
rank
in
the
army
for
ten
years
i
had
the
honor
of
being
of
the
ninth
cavalry
and
during
most
of
that
service
i
commanded
garrisons
composed
in
part
of
the
ninth
cavalry
and
other
organizations
of
cavalry
and
infantry
i
have
always
found
the
colored
race
represented
in
the
army
obedient
intelligent
and
zealous
in
the
discharge
of
duty
brave
in
battle
easily
disciplined
and
most
efficient
in
the
care
of
their
horses
arms
and
equipments
the
officers
have
habitually
shown
the
qualities
for
control
in
their
position
which
marked
them
as
faithful
and
sensible
in
the
discharge
of
their
duties
i
take
pleasure
in
bearing
witness
as
above
in
the
interest
of
the
race
you
represent

history
the
following
brief
sketch
of
spain
its
era
of
greatness
the
causes
leading
thereto
and
the
reasons
for
its
rapid
decline
will
be
of
interest
to
the
reader
at
this
point
in
the
narrative
as
it
will
bring
into
view
the
other
side
of
the
impending
conflict
spain
the
first
in
rank
among
the
powers
of
europe
by
reason
of
her
possessions
in
the
west
indies
especially
cuba
may
be
regarded
as
quite
a
near
neighbor
and
because
of
her
connection
with
the
discovery
and
settlement
of
the
continent
as
well
as
the
commanding
part
she
at
one
time
played
in
the
world
politics
her
history
can
not
but
awaken
within
the
breasts
of
americans
a
most
lively
interest
as
a
geographical
and
political
fact
spain
dates
from
the
earliest
times
and
the
spanish
people
gather
within
themselves
the
blood
and
the
traditions
of
the
three
great
continents
of
the
old
world
europe
asia
and
africa
united
to
produce
the
mighty
spaniard
of
the
and
centuries
it
would
be
an
interesting
subject
for
the
anthropologist
to
trace
the
construction
of
that
people
who
are
so
often
spoken
of
as
possessing
the
pure
blood
of
castile
and
as
the
facts
should
be
brought
to
view
another
proud
fiction
would
dissipate
in
thin
air
as
we
should
see
the
spaniard
arising
to
take
his
place
among
the
most
mixed
of
mankind
the
spain
that
we
are
considering
now
is
the
spain
that
gradually
emerged
from
a
chaos
of
conflicting
elements
into
the
unity
of
a
christian
nation
the
dismal
war
between
creeds
gave
way
to
the
greater
conflict
between
religions
when
cross
and
crescent
contended
for
supremacy
and
this
too
had
passed
the
four
stalwart
christian
provinces
of
leon
castile
aragon
and
navarre
had
become
the
four
pillars
of
support
to
a
national
throne
and
ferdinand
and
isabella
were
reigning
spain
has
now
apparently
passed
the
narrows
and
is
crossing
the
bar
with
prow
set
toward
the
open
sea
she
ends
her
war
with
the
moors
at
the
same
time
that
england
ends
her
wars
of
the
roses
and
the
battle
of
bosworth
field
may
be
classed
with
the
capitulation
of
granada
both
nations
confront
a
future
of
about
equal
promise
and
may
be
rated
as
on
equal
footing
as
this
new
era
of
the
world
opens
to
view
what
was
this
new
era
printing
had
been
invented
commerce
had
arisen
gunpowder
had
come
into
use
the
feudal
system
was
passing
royal
authority
had
become
paramount
and
spain
was
giving
to
the
world
its
first
lessons
in
what
was
early
stigmatized
as
the
knavish
calling
of
diplomacy
now
began
the
halcyon
days
of
spain
and
what
a
breed
of
men
she
produced
read
the
story
of
their
conquests
in
mexico
and
peru
as
told
with
so
much
skill
and
taste
by
our
own
prescott
or
read
of
the
grandeur
of
her
national
character
and
the
wonderful
valor
of
her
troops
and
the
almost
marvelous
skill
of
her
alexander
of
parma
and
her
spinola
as
described
by
our
great
motley
and
you
will
see
something
of
the
moral
and
national
glory
of
that
spain
which
under
charles
v
and
philip
ii
awed
the
world
into
respectful
silence
who
but
men
of
iron
under
a
commander
of
steel
could
have
conducted
to
a
successful
issue
the
awful
siege
of
antwerp
and
by
a
discipline
more
dreadful
than
death
kept
for
so
many
years
armed
control
of
the
country
of
the
brave
netherlanders
a
farnese
was
there
who
could
support
and
command
an
army
carry
philip
and
his
puerile
idiosyncrasies
upon
his
back
and
meet
the
fury
of
an
outraged
people
who
were
fighting
on
their
own
soil
for
all
that
man
holds
dear
never
was
wretched
cause
so
ably
led
never
were
such
splendid
talents
so
unworthily
employed
alexander
of

cortez
the
pizarros
were
representatives
of
that
form
of
human
character
that
spain
especially
developed
skill
and
daring
were
brought
out
in
dazzling
splendor
and

nor
are

for
making
such
an
exhibit

must
be
content
with
a
general
picture
quoted
directly
from
motley
he
says
look
at
the
broad
magnificent
spanish
peninsula
stretching
across
eight
degrees
of
latitude
and
ten
of
longtitude
commanding
the
atlantic
and
the
mediterranean
with
a
genial
climate
warmed
in
winter
by
the
vast
furnace
of
africa
and
protected
from
the
scorching
heats
of
summer
by
shady
mountain
and
forest
and
temperate
breezes
from
either
ocean
a
generous
southern
territory
flowing
with

all
the
richest
gifts
of

bountiful
nature
splendid

the

and
daily
expanding
madrid
rich
in
the
trophies
of
the
most
artistic
period
of
the
modern
world
cadiz
as
populous
at
that
day
as
london
seated
by
the
straits
where
the
ancient
and
modern
systems
of
traffic
were
blending
like
the
mingling
of
the
two
oceans
granada
the
ancient
wealthy
seat
of
the
fallen
moors
toledo
valladolid
and
lisbon
chief
city
of
the
recently
conquered
kingdom
of
portugal
counting
with
its
suburbs
a
larger
population
than
any
city
excepting
paris
in
europe
the
mother
of
distant
colonies
and
the
capital
of
the
traffic
with
both
the
indies
these
were
some
of
the
treasures
of
spain
herself
but
she
possessed
sicily
also
the
better
portion
of
italy
and
important
dependencies
in
africa
while
the
famous
maritime
discoveries
of
the
age
had
all
enured
to
her
aggrandizement
the
world
seemed
suddenly
to
have
expanded
its
wings
from
east
to
west
only
to
bear
the
fortunate
spanish
empire
to
the
most
dizzy
heights
of
wealth
and
power
the
most
accomplished
generals
the
most
disciplined
and
daring
infantry
the
world
has
ever
known
the
best
equipped
and
most
extensive
navy
royal
and
mercantile
of
the
age
were
at
the
absolute
command
of
the
sovereign
such
was
spain
such
is
not
spain
a
quite
recent
writer
speaking
of
spain
before
the
war
said
that
although
spain
in
extent
holds
the
sixth
place
in
the
european
states
it
really
now
subsists
merely
by
the
sufferance
of
stronger
nations
thus
has
that
nation
which
three
centuries
ago
dominated
the
world
lost
both
its
position
and
its
energy
without
attempting
to
sketch
chronologically
either
this
rise
or
this
decline
let
us
rather
direct
our
efforts
to
an
inquiry
into
the
causes
of
both
the
one
and
the
other
in
attempting
to
explain
the
greatness
of
spain
we
must
give
first
place
to
the
vigor
of
the
spanish
race
the
great
spaniard
was
a
mighty
compound
he
had
the
blood
of
rome
mingled
with
the
awful
torrent
that
gave
birth
to
the
soulless
goths
and
vandals
in
him
also
flowed
the
hot
blood
of
the
moors
he
was
both
sturdy
and
fiery
he
had
the
fervor
of
the
south
with
the
tenacity
of
the
north
the
pride
of
the
roman
with
the
passion
of
the
moor
the
spanish
race
was
emphatically
a
rich
race
and
then
we
must
remember
that
this
race
had
been
forged
in
war
century
after
century
from
the
earliest
times
they
had
lived
with
their
arms
in
their
hands
first
came
the
long
war
between
the
arian
vandals
and
the
trinitarian
natives
then
the
war
with
the
followers
of
mahomed
the
whole
mission
of
life
to
them
was
to
fight
naturally
there
was
developed
in
the
people
at
large
the
most
complete
unification
and
subjection
individualism
gave
place
almost
entirely
to
the
common
weal
and
the
spectacle
was
presented
of
a
nation
with
no
political
questions
maccaulay
maintains
that
human
nature
is
such
that
aggregations
of
men
will
always
show
the
two
principles
of
radicalism
and
conservatism
and
that
two
parties
will
exist
in
consequence
one
composed
of
those
who
are
ever
looking
to
a
brighter
future
the
other
of
those
who
are
ever
seeking
to
restore
a
delightful
past
but
no
such
phenomena
appear
in
the
ascending
period
of
spain
history
the
whole
nation
moved
as
an
organized
army
steadily
forward
until
its
zenith
was
reached
this
solidity
was
a
marked
element
of
its
strength
buckle
recognizes
this
and
accounts
for
the
harmonious
movements
of
the
nation
by
the
influence
of
two
leading
principles
which
he
is
pleased
to
call
superstition
and
loyalty
the
arab
invasion
had
pressed
upon
the
christians
with
such
force
that
it
was
only
by
the
strictest
discipline
that
the
latter
had
managed
to
survive
to
secure
such
discipline
and
at
the
same
time
supply
the
people
with
the
steady
enthusiasm
necessary
to
support
a
war
from
century
to
century
all
the
terrors
and
all
the
glories
that
could
be
derived
from
religion
were
employed
the
church
and
the
state
the
prince
and
the
priest
became
as
one
and
loyalty
and
religion
devotion
to
the
standard
and
to
the
cross
were
but
different
names
for
the
same
principles
and
actions
hence
spain
emerged
to
greatness
without
the
least
dream
of
liberty
of
either
person
conscience
or
thought
her
rallying
cry
was
for
the
prince
and
the
church
not
for
god
and
liberty
she
went
up
to
greatness
the
most
loyal
and
the
most
religious
of
nations
but
liberty
justice
and
truth
were
not
upon
her
banners
look
over
the
territory
settled
and
conquered
by
her
and
what
do
we
see
columbus
sailing
under
spain
names
the
first
land
he
discovers
san
salvador
the
first
settlement
made
in
this
country
is
augustine
the
second
sante
fe
look
down
over
the
southern
half
of
our
continent
and
such
names
as
espirito
santo
corpus
christi
san
diego
san
juan
san
jose
san
domingo
attest
the
religious
zeal
of
the
conquerors
they
were
missionaries
of
the
cross
robbing
the
people
of
their
gold
and
paying
them
off
with
religion
steadfast
in
the
faith
and
sturdy
in
her
loyalty
spain
resisted
all
innovations
with
respect
to
her
religious
beliefs
and
all
insurrections
against
her
government
her
alva
and
her
torquemada
but
illustrated
how
strong
was
her
conservatism
while
her
isabella
and
her
philip
ii
show
how
grand
and
comprehensive
and
how
persistent
was
her
aggressiveness
under
the
idea
of
spreading
and
upholding
the
true
faith
she
not
only
meant
to
hold
all
she
had
of
wealth
and
power
but
she
aspired
to
universal
dominion
already
chief
she
desired
to
be
sole
and
this
in
the
interest
and
name
of
the
holy
church
the
reformation
did
not
disturb
spain
it
was
crushed
out
within
twenty
years
the
spirit
of
liberty
that
had
been
growing
in
england
since
bosworth
field
and
that
was
manifesting
itself
in
germany
and
the
netherlands
and
that
had
begun
to
quiver
even
in
france
did
not
dare
stir
itself
in
spain
spain
was
united
or
rather
was
solidity
itself
and
this
solidity
was
both
its
strength
and
its
death
england
was
not
so
united
and
england
went
steadily
onward
and
upward
but
spain
unity
destroyed
her
because
it
practically
destroyed
individualism
and
presented
the
strange
paradox
of
a
strong
nation
of
weak
men
as
a
machine
spain
in
the
sixteenth
century
was
a
marvel
of
power
as
an
aggregation
of
thinking
men
it
was
even
then
contemptible
ferdinand
charles
v
and
philip
ii
were
able
and
illustrious
rulers
and
they
appeared
at
a
time
when
their
several
characters
could
tell
on
the
immediate
fortunes
of
spain
they
were
warriors
and
the
nation
was
entirely
warlike
during
this
period
the
spaniard
overran
the
earth
not
that
he
might
till
the
soil
but
that
he
might
rob
the
man
who
did
with
one
hand
he
was
raking
in
the
gold
and
silver
of
mexico
and
peru
with
the
other
confiscating
the
profits
of
the
trade
and
manufactures
of
the
low
countries
and
all
in
the
name
of
the
great
god
and
saints
how
was
spain
overthrown
the
answer
is
a
short
one
spain
under
philip
ii
staked
her
all
upon
a
religious
war
against
the
awakening
age
she
met
the
reformation
within
her
own
borders
and
extinguished
it
but
thought
had
broken
loose
from
its
chains
and
was
abroad
in

england

turned
protestant

denmark
norway

indeed
all

blast
italy
furnished
the

and
spain
the
powder
in
this
unequal
fight
between
the
old
and
the
new
spain
was
not
merely
the
representative
of
the
old
she
was
the
old
and
she
armed
her
whole
strength
in
its
behalf
here
was
a
religion
separated
from
all
moral
principle
and
devoid
of
all
softening
sentiment
its
most
appropriate
formula
being
death
to
all
heretics
death
not
to
tyrants
not
to
oppressors
not
to
robbers
and
but
death
to
it
was
this
that
equipped
her
armada
the
people
were
too
loyal
and
too
pious
to
think
and
so
were
hurled
in
a
solid
mass
against
the
armed
thought
of
the
coming
age
and
a
mighty
nation
crumbled
as
in
a
day
with
the
destruction
of
her
armada
her
warlike
ascendancy
passed
and
she
had
nothing
to
put
in
its
place
she
had
not
tillers
of
the
soil
mechanics
or
skilled
merchants
business
was
taking
the
place
of
war
all
over
the
world
but
spain
knew
only
religion
and
war
hence
worsted
in
her
only
field
she
was
doomed
from
the
days
of
philip
ii
her
decline
was
rapid
her
territory
slipped
from
her
as
rapidly
as
it
had
been
acquired
her
great
domains
on
our
soil
are
now
the
seat
of
thriving
communities
of
people
the
whole
continent
of
south
america
has
thrown
off
her
yoke
though
still
retaining
her
language
and
our
troops
now
embarked
from
port
tampa
are
destined
to
wrest
from
her
the
two
only
remaining
colonies
subject
to
her
sway
in
the
western
world
cuba
and
porto
rico
with
all
her
losses
hitherto
spain
has
not
learned
wisdom
antagonistic
to
truth
and
liberty
she
seems
to
sit
in
the
shadow
of
death
hugging
the
delusions
that
have
betrayed
her
while
all
other
people
of
earth
are
pressing
onward
toward
light
and
liberty
the
struggle
in
cuba
had
been
going
on
for
years
and
in
that
colony
of
less
than
two
millions
of
inhabitants
many
of
whom
were
spaniards
there
was
now
an
army
four
times
as
large
as
the
standing
army
of
the
united
states
against
this
army
and
against
the
government
of
spain
a
revolt
had
been
carried
on
previous
to
the
present
outbreak
for
a
period
of
ten
years
and
which
had
been
settled
by
concessions
on
the
part
of
the
home
government
the
present
revolt
was
of
two
standing
when
our
government
decided
to
interfere
the
cubans
had
maintained
disorder
if
they
had
not
carried
on
war
and
they
had
declined
to
be
pacified
in
their
army
they
experienced
no
color
difficulties
gomez
maceo
and
quintin
banderas
were
generals
honored
and
loved
maceo
especially
coming
to
be
the
hero
and
idol
of
the
insurgents
of
all
classes
and
it
can
truthfully
be
said
that
no
man
in
either
the
cuban
or
spanish
army
in
all
the
cuban
struggle
previous
to
our
intervention
has
earned
a
loftier
fame
as
patriot
soldier
and
man
of
noble
mould
than
antonio
maceo
cuba
by
far
the
most
advanced
of
all
the
west
indian
colonies
cuba
essentially
spanish
was
destined
to
be
the
battle
ground
between
our
troops
and
the
veterans
of
spain
the
question
to
be
settled
was
that
of
spain
sovereignty
spain
right
to
rule
over
the
colonies
of
cuba
and
porto
rico
was
disputed
by
the
united
states
and
this
question
and
this
alone
is
to
be
settled
by
force
of
arms
further
than
this
the
issue
does
not
go
the
dictum
of
america
is
spain
shall
not
rule
the
questions
of
annexation
expansion
and
imperialism
were
not
before
us
as
we
launched
our
forces
to
drive
spain
out
of
the
west
indies
the
cuban
flag
was
closely
associated
with
our
own
standard
popularly
and
cuba
libre
was
a
sentiment
in
june
we
are
ready
to
help
the
cubans
gain
their
liberty
was
the
honest
expression
of
thousands
who
felt
they
were
going
forward
in
a
war
for
others
chapter
passage
landing
and
first

in

the
tenth

the
rescue

the

riders
was
there
an
ambush
notes
the
passage
to
santiago
was
generally
smooth
and
uneventful
says
general
shafter
in
his
official
report
but
when
the
fact
is
called
to
mind
that
the
men
had
been
on
board
a
week
before
sailing
and
were
a
week
more
on
the
passage
and
that
the
conveniences
on
many
of
the
transports
in
the
nature
of
sleeping
accommodations
space
for
exercise
closet
accommodations
were
not
all
that
could
have
been
desired
and
that
the
opinion
was
general
throughout
the
army
that
the
travel
ration
was
faulty
it
can
not
be
doubted
that
the
trip
was
a
sore
trial
to
the
enlisted
men
at
least
the
monotonous
days
passed
in
the
harbor
at
port
tampa
while
waiting
for
orders
to
sail
were
unusually
trying
to
the
men
they
were
relieved
somewhat
by
bathing
swimming
gaming
and
chatting
on
the
coming
events
a
soldier
who
was
in
one
of
the
colored
regiments
describes
the
inside
life
of
one
of
the
transports
as
follows
after
some
miles
of
railroad
travel
and
much
hustling
we
were
put
on
board
the
transport
i
say
but
it
is
simply
because
we
can
not
use
the
terms
we
were
huddled
together
below
two
other
regiments
and
under
the
water
line
in
the
dirtiest
closest
most
sickening
place
imaginable
for
about
fifteen
days
we
were
on
the
water
in
this
dirty
hole
but
being
soldiers
we
were
compelled
to
accept
this
without
a
murmur
we
ate
corn
beef
and
canned
tomatoes
with
our
hard
bread
until
we
were
anything
but
half
way
pleased
in
the
fifth
or
sixth
day
out
to
sea
the
water
furnished
us
became
muddy
or
dirty
and
well
flavored
with
salt
and
remained
so
during
the
rest
of
the
journey
then
the
ship
cooks
knowing
well
our
condition
made
it
convenient
to
themselves
to
sell
us
a
glass
of
clean
ice
water
and
a
small
piece
of
bread
and
tainted
meat
for
the
sum
of
cents
or
one
dollar
as
the
case
might
be
a
passage
from
port
tampa
around
the
eastern
end
of
cuba
through
the
windward
passage
even
in
june
is
ordinarily
pleasant
on
the
deck
of
a
clean
steamer
protected
from
the
sun
rays
by
a
friendly
awning
it
may
be
put
down
as
nearly
an
ideal
pleasure
trip
but
crowded
into
freight
ships
as
these
men
were
many
of
them
clad
in
thick
and
uncomfortable
clothing
reduced
to
the
uninviting
travel
ration
compelled
to
spend
most
of
the
time
below
decks
occupied
with
thoughts
of
home
and
friends
and
beset
with
forebodings
of
coming
events
it
was
very
far
from
being
to
them
a
pastime
of
the
thousands
who
are
going
to
cuba
to
magnify
the
american
flag
not
all
will
return
occasionally
the
gay
music
of
the
bands
would
relieve
the
dull
routine
and
cause
the
spirits
to
rise
under
the
effects
of
some
enlivening
waltz
or
stirring
patriotic
air
or
entering
a
school
of
flying
fish
the
men
would
be
entertained
to
see
these
creatures
dart
from
the
waves
like
arrows
from
the
bow
and
after
a
graceful
flight
of
perhaps
near
two
hundred
yards
drop
again
into
the
sea
but
taken
altogether
it
was
a
voyage
that
furnishes
little
for
the
historian
the
transports
were
so
arranged
as
to
present
an
interesting
and
picturesque
spectacle
as
they
departed
from
our
shores
on
their
ocean
march
forming
in
three
columns
with
a
distance
of
about
yards
between
the
columns
and
the
vessels
in
the
columns
being
distanced
from
one
another
about
yards
the
fleet
was
convoyed
from
port
tampa
by
small
naval
vessels
until
it
reached
a
point
between
the
dry
tortugas
and
key
west
here
it
was
met
by
the
noble
battleship
indiana
and
nine
other
war
vessels
thus
making
a
convoy
altogether
of
fifteen
fighting
craft
transports
and
convoy
now
made
an
armada
of
more
than
forty
ships
armed
and
manned
by
the
audacious
modern
republic
whose
flag
waved
from
every
masthead
thus
spreading
out
over
miles
of
smooth
sea
moving
quietly
along
by
steam
carrying
in
its
arms
the
flower
of
the
american
army
every
man
of
which
was
an
athlete
this
fleet
announced
to
the
world
the
grim
purpose
of
a
nation
aroused
the
weather
from
the
time
of
leaving
port
tampa
continued
fine
until
the
fleet
entered
the
passage
between
the
western
coast
of
hayti
and
the
eastern
end
of
cuba
known
as
the
windward
passage
when
the
breeze
freshened
and
a
rough
sea
began
continuing
more
or
less
up
to
the
time
of
landing
rounding
this
eastern
coast
of
cuba
the
fleet
headed
its
course
westerly
and
on
the
morning
of
the
was
able
to
determine
its
position
as
being
off
guantanamo
bay
about
fifty
miles
east
of
santiago
here
eight
days
before
the
first
battle
on
cuban
soil
in
which
four
american
marines
were
killed
had
been
fought
about
noon
on
the
same
day
the
fleet
came
to
a
halt
off
santiago
harbor
or
a
little
to
the
west
of
the
entrance
to
it
and
admiral
sampson
came
on
board
he
and
general
shafter
soon
after
went
ashore
to
consult
the
cuban
general
garcia
who
was
known
to
be
in
that
vicinity
with
about
well
armed
troops
the
voyage
over
and
the
men
having
been
crowded
together
on
shipboard
for
nearly
two
weeks
it
was
now
expedient
to
get
them
on
shore
as
soon
as
possible
but
it
was
necessary
to
find
out
beforehand
what
defences
were
along
the
coast
and
what
forces
of
the
enemy
were
likely
to
be
encountered
in
landing
the
fleet
lay
off
from
the
shore
about
a
mile
and
it
was
no
small
undertaking
to
convey
the
men
on
board
with
all
their
arms
and
equipments
to
the
shore
in
small
boats
over
a
rough
sea
especially
should
the
landing
be
disputed
it
was
to
arrange
for
the
landing
and
also
to
map
out
a
general
plan
of
campaign
that
the
three
great
leaders
shafter
sampson
and
garcia
met
at
aserradores
on
the
afternoon
of
june
as
the
american
fleet
stood
guard
over
the
harbor
of
santiago
general
garcia
was
already
aware
of
the
coming
of
the
fleet
having
received
a
message
from
miles
two
weeks
previous
the
letter
of
general
miles
ran
as
follows
headquarters
of
the
army
in
the
field
tampa
june
dear
general
i
am
very
glad
to
have
received
your
officers
general
enrique
collazo
and
carlos
hernandez
the
latter
of
whom
returns
with
our
best
wishes
for
your
success
it
would
be
a
very
great
assistance
if
you
could
have
as
large
a
force
as
possible
in
the
vicinity
of
the
harbor
of
santiago
de
cuba
and
communicate
any
information
by
signals
which
colonel
hernandez
will
explain
to
you
either
to
our
navy
or
to
our
army
on
its
arrival
which
we
hope
will
be
before
many
days
it
would
also
assist
us
very
much
if
you
could
drive
in
and
harass
any
spanish
troops
near
or
in
santiago
de
cuba
threatening
or
attacking
them
at
all
points
and
preventing
by
every
means
any
possible
coming
to
that
garrison
while
this
is
being
done
and
before
the
arrival
of
our
army
if
you
can
seize
and
hold
any
commanding
position
to
the
east
or
west
of
santiago
de
cuba
or
both
that
would
be
advantageous
for
the
use
of
our
artillery
it
will
be
exceedingly
gratifying
to
us
to
this
general
garcia
replied
that
he
would
take
measures
at
once
to
carry
out
your
miles
recommendation
but
concentration
of
forces
will
require
some
time
roads
bad
and
cubans
scattered
will
march
without
delay
admiral
sampson
also
cabled
the
secretary
of
the
navy
that
garcia
regards
his
miles
wishes
and
suggestions
as
orders
and
immediately
will
take
measures
to
concentrate
forces
at
the
points
indicated
but
he
is
unable
to
do
so
as
early
as
desired
on
account
of
his
expedition
at
banes
port
cuba
but
will
march
without
delay
all
of
his
subordinates
are
ordered
to
assist
to
disembark
the
united
states
troops
and
to
place
themselves
under
orders
it
was
in
compliance
with
these
requests
that
general
garcia
had
the
five
thousand
troops
so
near
santiago
at
the
time
he
welcomed
shafter
and
sampson
to
his
camp
as
mentioned
above
and
there
is
every
necessary
evidence
that
these
cuban
troops
took
part
in
the
fight
about
santiago
says
general
miles
of
garcia
he
had
troops
in
the
rear
as
well
as
on
both
sides
of
the
garrison
at
santiago
before
the
arrival
of
our
troops
it
was
agreed
that
the
force
of
five
hundred
men
under
general
castillo
posted
near
daiquiri
should
be
increased
to
and
should
be
prepared
to
make
an
attack
upon
the
rear
of
the
spanish
garrison
at
daiquiri
on
the
morning
of
the
at
which
time
the
debarkation
would
begin
general
rabi
with
about
men
was
also
to
attack
cabanas
at
the
same
time
in
the
same
manner
the
transports
and
war
vessels
so
manoeuvring
as
to
give
the
impression
that
a
landing
was
to
be
made
at
that
place
while
these
attacks
in
the
rear
were
distracting
the
garrisons
the
navy
by
order
of
admiral
sampson
was
to
start
up
a
vigorous
bombardment
of
all
the
villages
along
the
coast
thus
clearing
the
shore
for
the
landing
of
the
army
thus
did
the
conference
unite
the
hands
of
americans
and
cubans
in
the
fight
against
spain
on
cuban
soil
and
each
was
pledged
to
the
other
by
the
expressions
of
good
will
having
accomplished
its
work
the
important
conference
closed
admiral
sampson
and
general
shafter
to
return
to
their
ships
and
general
garcia
to
carry
out
the
part
of
the
work
assigned
to
him

he
did

was
furious
throughout

began
the
work
of
going

the
larger
of
the
boats
were
capable
of
carrying
ten
or
twelve
men
each
while
the
smaller
ones
could
carry
but
six
or
seven
during
the
passage
to
the
shore
several
of
the
men
who
had
escaped
thus
far
were
taken
with
seasickness
greatly
to
the
amusement
of
their
more
hardy
companions
the
landing
was
made
at
a
pier
which
had
been
used
formerly
as
a
railroad
pier
but
was
now
abandoned
and
somewhat
dilapidated
to
get
from
the
boats
to
the
pier
in
this
rough
sea
was
the
most
perilous
part
of
the
whole
trip
from
tampa
to
cuba
as
the
boats
would
rise
on
the
waves
almost
level
with
the
landing
place
it
was
necessary
to
leap
quickly
from
the
boat
to
the
shore
in
this
way
two
cavalrymen
of
the
tenth
lost
their
lives
falling
into
the
sea
with
their
equipments
on
and
sinking
before
help
could
reach
them
some
of
the
boats
were
rowed
ashore
and
made
a
landing
on
the
beach
some
distance
from
the
pier
by
this
method
some
men
of
the
tried
to
be
the
first
to
land
but
failed
that
regiment
landing
however
in
the
first
body
of
troops
to
go
ashore
and
being
the
second
in
order
in
the
invasion
of
the
island
by
night
of
the
more
than
of
the
troops
were
on
shore
and
by
the
evening
of
the
the
whole
army
was
disembarked
according
to
the
program
announced
at
the
beginning
the
squadron
of
cavalry
coming
in
at
the
close
of
the
march
to
the
shore
the
only
national
movement
on
our
part
deserving
to
be
brought
into
comparison
with
the
expedition
against
the
spanish
power
in
cuba
is
that
of
fifty
years
earlier
when
general
scott
sailed
at
the
head
of
the
army
of
invasion
against
mexico
some
of
the
occurrences
of
that
expedition
especially
connected
with
its
landing
should
be
carefully
studied
and
if
the
reports
which
have
reached
the
public
concerning
it
are
truthful
we
would
do
well
to
consider
how
far
the
methods
then
in
use
could
be
applied
now
scribner
recent
history
published
just
before
the
outbreak
of
the
spanish
war
tells
the
story
of
that
expedition
so
far
as
it
tells
it
at
all
in
the
following
sentence
on
the
of
march
the
fleet
with
scott
army
came
to
anchor
a
few
miles
south
of
vera
cruz
and
two
days
later
he
landed
his
whole
force
nearly
twelve
thousand
men
by
means
of
a
writer
in
a
recent
number
of
army
and
navy
says
general
division
of
men
were
landed
in
one
hour
and
the
whole
force
was
landed
in
six
hours
without
accident
or
confusion
in
the
prosecution
of
that
unholy
war
which
lasted
about
a
year
nearly
three
thousand
men
were
lost
in
battle
and
about
as
many
more
by
disease
peace
being
finally
made
by
the
cession
of
territory
on
the
part
of
mexico
the
united
states
paying
in
return
much
more
than
the
territory
was
worth
the
twenty
millions
paid
to
texas
probably
in
great
part
went
into
the
coffers
of
the
patriots
who
occupied
that
region
some
of
whom
had
not
been
known
as
desirable
citizens
in
the
parts
from
which
they
came
and
had
manifested
their
patriotism
by
leaving
their
country
for
their
country
good
the
fifteen
millions
handed
over
to
mexico
looks
like
a
contribution
to
a
conscience
fund
and
an
atonement
offered
for
an
assault
without
provocation
the
country
gained
arizona
new
mexico
california
and
finally
texas
but
it
lost
six
thousand
good
men
the
cost
of
the
war
and
all
told
in
negotiations
about
thirty
million
dollars
besides
however
it
is
not
always
profitable
to
look
up
the
harvests
of
war
there
are
always
two
the
harvest
of
gain
and
the
harvest
of
loss
death
and
debt
are
reapers
as
well
as
are
honor
and
extent
of
territory
the
feelings
of
the
six
thousand
american
troops
who
landed
on
cuban
soil
on
june
may
well
be
imagined
although
they
felt
the
effects
of
the
confinement
to
which
they
had
been
subjected
while
on
shipboard
there
was
very
little
sickness
among
them
again
possessed
of
the
free
use
of
their
limbs
they
swarmed
the
beach
and
open
space
near
the
landing
making
themselves
at
home
and
confronting
the
difficulties
and
perils
that
lay
before
them
with
a
courage
born
of
national
pride
before
them
were
the
mountains
with
their
almost
impassable
roads
the
jungles
filled
with
poisonous
plants
and
the
terrible
prickly
underbrush
and
pointed
grass
in
which
skulked
the
land
crab
and
various
reptiles
whose
bite
or
sting
was
dangerous
twenty
miles
of
this
inhospitable
country
lay
between
them
and
santiago
their
true
objective
and
somewhere
on
the
road
to
that
city
they
knew
they
were
destined
to
meet
a
foe
skilled
in
all
the
arts
of
modern
warfare
who
would
contest
their
advance
the
prospect
however
did
not
unnerve
them
although
they
could
well
conjecture
that
all
who
landed
would
not
some
in
that
six
thousand
were
destined
never
again
to
set
foot
on
shipboard
out
of
the
infantry
and
the
tenth
cavalry
men
were
to
fall
both
before
spanish
bullets
and
disease
ere
these
organizations
should
assemble
to
return
to
their
native
shores
these
thoughts
did
not
prevent
the
men
from
taking
advantage
of
what
nature
had
to
offer
them
we
landed
in
rowboats
amid
and
after
the
cessation
of
the
bombardment
of
the
little
hamlet
and
coast
by
the
and
writes
a
brave
soldier
of
the
infantry
and
adds
immediately
we
then
helped
ourselves
to
cocoanuts
which
we
found
in
abundance
near
the
landing
ordinarily
this
statement
so
trivial
and
apparently
unimportant
would
not
merit
repetition
but
in
its
connection
here
it
is
significant
as
showing
the
immediate
tendency
of
the
men
to
resort
to
the
fruits
of
the
country
despite
all
warnings
to
the
contrary
the
two
weeks
experience
on
board
the
transports
had
made
the
finding
of
cocoanuts
an
event
to
be
noted
and
the
dry
pulp
and
strongly
flavored
milk
of
this
tropical
fruit
became
extremely
grateful
to
the
palate
even
if
not
altogether
safe
for
the
stomach
if
ripe
however
the
cocoanut
could
scarcely
be
more
ungenial
to
many
than
the
raw
canned
tomatoes
upon
which
they
had
in
part
subsisted
during
the
voyage
it
is
to
be
added
that
this
report
of
the
finding
of
the
cocoanuts
is
not
the
report
of
an
old
soldier
but
of
a
young
and
intelligent
first
enlistment
man
lawton
division
soon
after
landing
was
ordered
to
move
forward
in
the
direction
of
santiago
on
the
road
leading
past
siboney
a
staff
officer
writing
of
that
movement
says
general
lawton
with
his
division
in
obedience
to
this
order
pushed
forward
from
daiquiri
about
five
miles
when
night
overtook
him
and
he
bivouacked
on
the
road
an
old
soldier
of
the
writing
me
from
the
hospital
in
tampa
florida
july
says
of
the
same
event
after
the
regiment
landed
we
marched
about
four
and
a
half
miles
through
the
mountains
then
we
made
camp
the
old
soldier
says
nothing
of
cocoanuts
but
makes
his
statement
with
as
much
accuracy
as
possible
and
with
no
waste
of
words
the
novice
describing
the
same
thing
says
a
short
distance
ahead
from
the
shore
we
bivouacked
for
the
night
we
were
soon
lying
in
dreamland
so
far
from
friends
and
home
indeed
on
a
distant
distant
shore
these
two
extracts
show
at
once
the
difference
between
the
soldier
produced
by
years
of
trial
and
training
on
our
plains
and
the
soldier
who
but
yesterday
was
a
civilian
with
the
one
the
march
is
a
short
distance
with
the
other
it
is
about
four
and
a
half
miles
one
reports
that
they
made
camp
the
other
talks
of
dreamland
friend
home
and
distant
shore
one
expresses
his
feelings
the
other
shows
control
of
feeling
and
reserve
in
expression
that
first
night
on
cuban
soil
the
night
following
june
was
one
without
events
but
one
of
great
concern
to
the
commanders
on
shore
and
on
the
fleet
the
work
of
disembarking
had
gone
on
successfully
and
already
about
six
thousand
men
were
on
shore
nearly
the
whole
of
lawton
division
with
bates
independent
brigade
were
bivouacked
as
we
have
seen
about
five
miles
from
daiquiri
exactly
where
the
railroad
crosses
the
wagon
road
leading
to
siboney
general
troops
one
brigade
were
encamped
on
the
open
ground
near
the
landing
the
remainder
of
his
division
being
still
on
the
transports
the
infantry
was
with
lawton
the
tenth
cavalry
was
ashore
with
wheeler
troops
a
detachment
of
the
was
put
on
outpost
duty
on
that
night
of
their
landing
and
five
miles
within
cuban
territory
they
tramped
their
solitary
beats
establishing
and
guarding
the
majestic
authority
of
the
united
states
lawton
orders
were
to
seize
and
hold
the
town
of
siboney
at
which
place
kent
division
containing
the
was
to
land
it
was
then
intended
that
the
whole
army
should
advance
as
rapidly
as
would
be
consistent
with
supplying
the
men
with
rations
toward
santiago
siboney
was
to
be
the
base
of
supplies
and
from
this
point
ammunition
and
food
were
to
be
conveyed
to
the
front
by
wagons
and
pack
trains
general
shafter
also
intended
that
lawton
with
his
division
should
lead
the
advance
upon
santiago
but
circumstances
beyond
his
control
brought
about
a
different
result
on
the
morning
of
the
lawton
division
was
in
motion
early
and
before
ten
he
was
able
to
report
that
the
spaniards
had
evacuated
siboney
and
were
in
full
retreat
pursued
by
a
body
of
cubans
under
direction
of
general
castillo
that
the
town
was
in
his
hands
and
he
had
also
captured
one
locomotive
and
nearly
one
hundred
cars
loaded
with
coal
general
young

of
general
wheeler
cavalry
division
got
on
shore
on
the
afternoon
of
the
and
after
landing
received
verbal
orders
to
move
out
with
three
days
rations
to
a
good
camping
place
between
juraguacito
and
siboney
on
the
road
leading
to
santiago
de
cuba
in
obedience
to
these
orders
at
in
the
afternoon
young
with
the
rough
riders
and
a
squadron
from
each
of
the
first
and
tenth
regular
cavalry
moved
from
the
bivouack
near
the
landing
and
arrived
at
siboney
at
about
when
general
young
arrived
at
siboney
he
had
with
him
the
rough
riders
the
other
troops
having
been
delayed
by
the
crowded
condition
of
the
trail
and
the
difficulty
of
following
after
nightfall
although
these
troops
are
always
spoken
of
as
cavalry
the
reader
must
not
forget
that
they
were
dismounted
and
in
marching
and
fighting
were
the
same
as
infantry
general
young
on
arriving
at
siboney
reported
to
general
wheeler
who
had
preceded
him
to
the
same
place
the
statements
of
the
several
commanders
here
appear
somewhat
conflicting
although
not
inexplicable
general
lawton
says
yesterday
afternoon
late
general
wheeler
and
staff
arrived
and
established
his
headquarters
within
the
limits
of
my
command
saw
him
after
dark
late
last
night
colonel
wood
regiment
of
dismounted
cavalry
rough
riders
passed
through
my
camp
at
division
headquarters
and
later
general
young
with
some
of
the
dismounted
cavalry
and
early
this
morning
others
of
the
dismounted
cavalry
wheeler
says
that
in
obedience
to
instructions
from
the
commanding
given
to
him
in
person
he
proceeded
on
june
to
siboney
but
does
not
say
at
what
hour
he
says
he
rode
out
to
the
front
and
found
that
the
enemy
had
halted
and
established
themselves
at
a
point
about
three
miles
from
siboney
he
then
informs
us
that
at
on
that
evening
of
the
general
young
reached
siboney
with
eight
troops
of
colonel
wood
regiment
a
b
d

k
and
l
strong
troops
a
b

and
k
of
the
first
cavalry
in
all
and
troops
a
b
e
and
i
of
the
tenth
cavalry
in
all
men
making
a
total
force
of
men
which
included
nearly
all
of
my
command
which
had
disembarked
these
troops
had
marched
from
daiquiri
miles
with
the
assistance
of
general
castillo
a
rough
map
of
the
country
was
prepared
and
the
position
of
the
enemy
fully
explained
and
i
determined
to
make
an
attack
lieutenant
miley
says
that
the
whole
brigade
of
wheeler
troops
arrived
in
siboney
about
dark
and
were
occupying
the
same
ground
as
general
lawton
in
cuba
with
shafter
p
general
young
says
that
after
reporting
to
general
wheeler
he
asked
and
obtained
from
general
wheeler
authority
to
make
a
reconnoisance
in
force
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
positive
information
as
to
the
position
and
movements
of
the
enemy
in
front
the
distance
from
daiquiri
to
siboney
was
but
eleven
miles
and
as
the
troops
left
the
former
place
at
it
is
probable
that
they
were
all
bivouacked
near
siboney
before
as
they
were
all
together
according
to
general
wheeler
report
at
on
the
morning
of
the
general
young
having
discovered
that
there
were
two
roads
or
trails
leading
from
siboney
northward
toward
the
town
of
sevilla
determined
to
make
his
reconnoisance
by
both
these
trails
he
directed
colonel
wood
to
move
by
the
western
trail
and
to
keep
a
careful
lookout
and
to
attack
any
spaniards
he
might
encounter
being
careful
to
join
his
right
in
the
event
of
an
engagement
with
the
left
of
the
column
advancing
by
the
eastern
trail
colonel
wood
column
was
the
left
column
and
was
composed
of
the
rough
riders
only
the
column
marching
by
the
eastern
trail
was
composed
of
the
first
and
tenth
cavalry
regulars
and
was
under
the
command
of
general
young
it
was
the
intention
of
general
young
by
this
column
to
gain
the
left
and
thus
attack
in
front
and
left
as
early
as
captain
mills
discovered
the
enemy
exactly
as
had
been
described
by
general
castillo
when
this
was
done
word
was
sent
to
colonel
wood
who
was
making
his
way
to
the
front
over
a
more
difficult
route
than
the
one
by
which
general
young
column
had
marched
a
delay
was
therefore
made
on
the
part
of
general
young
in
order
that
the
attack
should
begin
on
both
flanks
at
the
same
time
during
this
delay
general
wheeler
arrived
and
was
informed
of
the
plans
and
dispositions
for
the
attack
and
after
examining
the
position
gave
his
approval
of
what
had
been
done
whereupon
general
young
ordered
the
attack
general
wheeler
in
speaking
of
the
same
event
says
general
young
and
myself
examined
the
position
of
the
enemy
the
lines
were
deployed
and
i
directed
him
to
open
fire
with
the
hotchkiss
gun
the
enemy
replied
and
the
firing
immediately
became
general
there
can
be
no
question
as
to
the
planning
of
this
fight
nor
as
to
the
direction
of
the
american
force
in
the
fight
so
far
as
any
general
direction
was
possible
colonel
wood
directed
one
column
and
general
young
another
while
the
plan
of
the
attack
undoubtedly
originated
with
general
young
general
wheeler
conveys
as
much
when
he
says
general
young
deserves
special
commendation
for
his
cool
deliberate
and
skillful
management
general
young
if
only
the
commander
of
the
right
column
consisting
of
two
squadrons
of
regular
cavalry
had
not
as
large
a
command
nor
as
difficult
and
important
a
one
as
had
colonel
wood
and
hence
is
not
deserving
of
special
commendation
except
upon
the
general
ground
that
he
had
supervision
over
the
whole
battle
this
position
is
taken
by
general
shafter
in
his
report
who
though
admitting
the
presence
of
the
division
commander
credits
the
battle
to
general
young
the
commander
of
the
brigade
the
reconnoissance
in
force
for
which
young
had
obtained
authority
from
general
wheeler
on
the
night
of
the
had
developed
into
a
battle
and
the
plan
had
evolved
itself
from
the
facts
discovered
this
plan
general
wheeler
approved
but
in
no
such
way
as
to
take
the
credit
from
its
originator
and
it
is
doubtless
with
reference
both
to
the
plan
and
the
execution
that
he
bestows
on
general
young
the
mead
of
praise
this
statement
of
fact
does
not
in
the
least
detract
from
either
the
importance
or
the
praiseworthiness
of
the
part
played
by
colonel
wood
both
he
and
the
officers
and
men
commanded
by
him
received
both
from
general
young
and
from
the
division
commander
the
most
generous
praise
the
advance
of
wood
column
was
made
with
great
difficulty
owing
to
the
nature
of
the
ground
and
according
to
general
young
belief
he
was
in
the
rear
when
at
in
the
morning
captain
mills
discovered
the
enemy
and
a
cuban
guide
was
dispatched
to
warn
wood
and
a
delay
made
to
allow
time
for
him
to
come
up
colonel
wood
on
the
other
hand
claims
to
have
discovered
the
enemy
at
and
to
have
begun
action
almost
immediately
so
that
it
turned
out
as
young
had
planned
and
the
attack
of
both
wings
was
simultaneous
the
spaniards
were
posted
on
a
range
of
high
hills
in
the
form
of
a
v
the
opening
being
toward
siboney
from
which
direction
the
attack
came
from
colonel
wood
report
it
appears
that
soon
after
the
firing
began
he
found
it
necessary
to
deploy
five
troops
to
the
right
and
left
leaving
three
troops
in
reserve
the
enemy
lines
being
still
beyond
his
both
on
the
right
and
on
the
left
he
hastily
deployed
two
more
troops
which
made
the
lines
now
about
equal
in
length
the
firing
was
now
exceedingly
heavy
and
much
of
it
at
short
range
but
on
account
of
the
thick
underbrush
it
was
not
very
effective
comparatively
few
of
our
men
were
injured
captain
capron
at
this
time
received
his
mortal
wound
and
the
firing
became
so
terrific
that
the
last
remaining
troop
of
the
reserve
was
absorbed
by
the
firing
line
and
the
whole
regiment
ordered
to
advance
very
slowly
the
spanish
line
yielded
and
the
advance
soon
showed
that
in
falling
back
the
enemy
had
taken
a
new
position
about
three
hundred
yards
in
front
of
the
advancing
regiment
their
lines
extended
from
to
yards
and
the
firing
from
their
front
was
exceedingly
heavy
and
effective
a
good
many
men
were
wounded
and
several
officers
says
colonel
report
still
the
advance
was
kept
up
and
the
spanish
line
was
steadily
forced
back
we
now
began
says
colonel
wood
to
get
a
heavy
fire
from
a
ridge
on
our
right
which
enfiladed
our
line
the
reader
can
at
once
see
that
although
the
rough
riders
were
advancing
heroically
they
were
now
in
a
very
serious
situation
with
an
exceedingly
heavy
and
effective
fire
striking
them
in
front
and
a
heavy
enfilading
fire
raking
them
from
the
right
their
whole
strength
was
on
the
line
and
these
two
fires
must
have
reduced
their
effectiveness
with
great
rapidity
had
it
kept
up
the
spaniards
having
their
range
and
firing
by
volleys
it
was
for
the
regiment
a
moment
of
the
utmost
peril
had
they
been
alone
they
must
have
perished
it
was
from
this
perilous
situation
of
colonel
wood
command
that
one
of
the
most
popular
stories
of
the
war
originated
a
story
that
contained
some
truth
but
which
was
often
told
in
such
a
way
as
to
cause
irritation
and
in
some
instances
it
was
so
exaggerated
or
mutilated
in
the
telling
as
to
be
simply
ridiculous
on
the
day
after
the
battle
the
story
was
told
in
lawton
camp
according
to
the
testimony
of
an
intelligent
soldier
of
the
infantry
his
words
are
the
next
day
about
noon
we
heard
that
the
tenth
cavalry
had
met
the
enemy
and
that
the
tenth
cavalry
had
rescued
the
rough
riders
we
congratulated
ourselves
that
although
not
of
the
same
branch
of
service
we
were
of
the
same
color
and
that
to
the
eye
of
the
enemy
we
troopers
and
footmen
all
looked
alike
according
to
artists
and
cheap
newspaper
stories
this
rescuing
occurred
again
and
again
a
picture
is
extensively
advertized
as
an
actual
and
authoritative
presentation
of
this
regiment
the
tenth
cavalry
as
it
participated
in
that
great
struggle
and
their
heroic
rescue
of
the
rough
riders
on
that
memorable
day
this
especial
rescuing
took
place
on
juan
the
editor
of
a
religious
paper
declares
that
it
was
the
that
rescued
the
rough
riders
and
that
it
was
done
at
before
we
go
any
farther
let
us
see
just
what
the
tenth
cavalry
did
do
in
this
fight
that
their
action
was
highly
meritorious
admits
of
no
doubt
and
the
laurels
they
won
were
never
allowed
to
fade
during
the
whole
campaign
general
wheeler
speaks
of
them
with
the
first
cavalry
he
says
i
was
immediately
with
the
troops
of
the
first
and
tenth
regular
cavalry
dismounted
and
personally
noticed
their
brave
and
good
conduct
there
were
four
troops
of
the
tenth
engaged
composing
the
first
squadron
of
that
regiment
under
command
of
major
norval
troop
a
was
commanded
by
captain
beck
who
was
specially
commended
by
general
wheeler
for
good
conduct
second
lieutenant
mccoy
was
captain
beck
assistant
this
troop
moved
over
to
the
left
receiving
the
fire
of
the
enemy
but
making
no
response
the
distance
being
too
great
for
effective
carbine
firing
this
troop
reached
colonel
wood
right
and
made
the
line
continuous
so
that
there
was
now
a
force
in
front
of
that
ridge
where
the
spaniards
were
securely
entrenched
and
from
which
they
were
pouring
their
enfilading
fire
upon
colonel
wood
line
troop
a
although
coming
into
the
line
did
not
fire
their
presence
however
gave
the
rough
riders
the
assurance
that
their
flank
was
saved
troop
e
was
commanded
by
captain
ayres
with
second
lieutenant
george
vidmar
this
troop
was
placed
by
general
young
in
support
of
captain
watson
two
hotchkiss
guns
and
also
of
the
troops
in
their
front
the
troop
was
under
fire
one
hour
and
a
quarter
during
which
they
were
in
plain
view
of
the
spaniards
who
also
had
their
exact
range
one
man
was
killed
and
one
wounded
their
courage
coolness
and
discipline
in
this
trying
hour
and
a
quarter
were
of
the
very
highest
order
the
troop
commander
says
their
coolness
and
fine
discipline
were
superb
this
troop
did
not
fire
a
shot
thus
of
the
squadron
moved
to
its
positions
and
held
them
without
being
able
to
do
any
damage
to
the
enemy
as
they
were
carrying
out
to
the
letter
their
instructions
which
were
to
fire
only
when
they
could
see
the
enemy
troop
b
was
commanded
by
captain
watson
with
willard
as
second
lieutenant
a
detachment
of
this
troop
was
placed
in
charge
of
four
hotchkiss
mountain
guns
this
detachment
opened
fire
upon
the
enemy
using
the
ammunition
sparingly
as
they
had
but
fifty
rounds
with
them
shots
were
fired
apparently
with
effect
the
remainder
of
the
troop
under
lieutenant
williard
was
ordered
to
move
out
to
the
extreme
right
which
would
place
it
beyond
the
line
of
the
first
cavalry
thus
bringing
that
regiment
between
troop
a
of
the
tenth
which
connected
it
with
the
rough
riders
and
troop
b
which
was
to
be
on
its
extreme
right
lieutenant
williard
report
of
this
movement
is
as
follows
i
ordered
the
troop
forward
at
once
telling
them
to
take
advantage
of
all
cover
available
in
the
meantime
the
volleys
from
the
spanish
were
coming
in
quite
frequently
and
striking
the
ground
on
all
sides
near
where
we
were
i
found
it
very
difficult
to
move
the
men
forward
after
having
found
cover
and
ran
back
to
a
portion
of
the
troop
near
an
old
brick
wall
and
ordered
them
forward
at
once
they
then
made
a
dash
forward
and
in
doing
so
three
or
four
men
were
wounded
private
russell
severely
who
the
others
were
i
do
not
know
we
encountered
a
severe
fire
directly
after
this
move
forward
and
private
wheeler
was
wounded
in
the
left
leg
there
was
a
wire
fence
on
our
right
and
such
thick
underbrush
that
we
were
unable
to
get
through
right
there
so
had
to
follow
along
the
fence
for
some
distance
before
being
able
to
penetrate
finally
was
able
to
get
the
greater
proportion
of
my
men
through
and
about
this
time
i
met
lieutenants
fleming
and
miller
tenth
cavalry
moving
through
the
thicket
at
my
left
i
there
heard
the
order
passed
on
to
fire
ahead
as
there
was
danger
of
firing
into
our
own
forces
in
the
meantime
there
was
shouting
from
the
first
cavalry
in
our
front
fire
on
us
in
rear
my
troop
had
not
fired
a
shot
to
my
knowledge
nor
the
knowledge
of
any
officers
in
the
troop
about
this
time
i
found
i
was
unable
to
keep
the
troop
deployed
as
they
would
huddle
up
behind
one
rock
or
tree
so
i
gave
all
sergeants
orders
to
move
out
on
the
extreme
right
and
to
keep
in
touch
with
those
on
their
left
then
with
a
squad
of
about
five
men
i
moved
to
the
right
front
and
was
unfortunate
enough
to
lose
the
troop
i
could
see
nothing
of
them
except
the
men
with
me
but
as
i
had
given
explicit
instructions
to
my
sergeant
in
case
i
was
lost
from
them
to
continue
to
advance
until
halted
by
some
one
in
authority
i
moved
ahead
myself
hoping
to
find
them
later
on
in
making
a
rush
forward
three
men
of
my
squad
were
lost
from
me
in
some
way
i
still
had
two
men
with
me
privates
combs
and
jackson
and
in
the
next
advance
made
i
picked
up
a
first
cavalry
sergeant
who
had
fallen
out
from
exhaustion
after
a
terrific
climb
up
the
ridge
in
front
of
me
and
a
very
regular
though
ineffective
fire
from
the
enemy
kept
up
until
we
were
about
sixty
yards
from
the
summit
of
hill
we
reached
the
advance
line
of
the
first
united
states
cavalry
under
command
of
captain
wainwright
i
then
reported
to
him
for
orders
and
moved
forward
when
he
next
advanced
the
firing
had
ceased
and
no
more
shots
were
fired
to
my
knowledge
after
this
time
with
the
first
cavalry
troop
g
we
followed
along
the
right
of
the
ridge
and
came
down
to
the
right
front
encountering
no
opposition
or
fire
from
the
enemy
but
finding
the
enemy
breastworks
in
confusion
ammunition
and
articles
of
clothing
scattered
around
also
one
dead
spaniard
and
two
mauser
rifles
at
the
foot
of
the
ridge
we
met
some
of
the
first
volunteer
cavalry
and
being
utterly
exhausted
i
was
obliged
to
lie
down
soon
after
captain
mills
of
second
brigade
cavalry
division
came
up
to
where
i
was
and
placed
me
in
command
of
troop
k
first
united
states
cavalry
whose
officers
were
wounded
i
then
marched
them
forward
on
the
road
to
where
general
wheeler
was
sitting
and
received
orders
from
colonel
wood
first
volunteer
cavalry
to
remain
until
further
orders
and
make
no
further
advance
directly
afterwards
learning
the
action
was
over
i
reported
back
to
general
young
and
received
orders
to
remain
camped
with
the
first
cavalry
squadron
where
the
action
had
closed
in
the
meantime
i
should
have
stated
that
i
found
the
principal
part
of
my
troop
and
collected
them
and
left
them
under
the
first
sergeant
when
i
went
back
to
receive
orders
so
far
as
i
know
and
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge
the
men
of
my
troop
acted
with
the
greatest
bravery
advancing
on
an
enemy
who
could
not
be
seen
and
subjected
to
a
severe
and
heavy
fire
at
each
step
which
was
only
rendered
ineffective
to
a
great
degree
by
the
poor
marksmanship
of
the
enemy
as
many
times
we
were
in
sight
of
them
i
discovered
this
by
observation
after
the
engagement
while
we
could
see
nothing
we
were
also
subjected
to
a
severe
reverse
fire
from
the
hills
in
our
right
rear
several
men
being
wounded
by
this
fire
throughout
the
fight
the
men
acted
with
exceptional
coolness
in
my
judgment
the
casualties
were
privates
russell
braxton
and
morris
severely
wounded
privates
miller
grice
wheeler
and
gaines
slightly
wounded
less
severely
none
killed

respectfully

troop
b
tenth
cavalry
during
action
near
la
guasima
second
lieutenant
tenth
united
states
cavalry
commanding
troop
i
of
the
tenth
cavalry
was
commanded
by
first
lieutenant
fleming
with
second
lieutenant
miller
this
troop
moved
to
the
right
and
wedged
in
between
b
troop
and
the
right
of
the
first
cavalry
lieutenant
fleming
discovered
the
enemy
posted
on
the
high
ridge
immediately
in
front
of
his
troop
and
also
extending
to
his
right
in
front
of
b
troop
moving
his
troop
a
little
to
the
right
so
as
to
secure
room
to
advance
without
coming
in
contact
with
the
first
cavalry
he
then
directed
his
course
straight
toward
the
hill
on
which
he
had
located
the
enemy
the
advance
was
made
with
great
caution
the
men
seeking
cover
wherever
possible
and
dashing
across
the
open
spaces
at
full
run
thus
they
moved
until
the
base
of
the
steep
part
of
the
hill
was
reached
this
was
found
very
difficult
of
ascent
not
only
because
of
the
rugged
steepness
but
also
on
account
of
the
underbrush
and
the
grass
the
cacti
and
spanish
bayonet
that
grow
on
all
these
hillsides
paths
had
to
be
cut
through
these
prickly
obstructions
with
knives
and
sabres
consequently
the
advance
up
that
hill
though
free
from
peril
was
very
slow
and
trying
twice
during
the
advance
the
men
obtained
a
view
of
their
enemies
and
were
permitted
to
fire
the
instructions
were
rigidly
adhered
to
no
firing
only
at
the
visible
foe
lieutenant
fleming
says
owing
to
the
underbrush
it
was
impossible
for
me
to
see
but
a
very
few
men
at
a
time
but
as
they
all
arrived
on
the
crest
about
the
time
i
did
or
shortly
after
they
certainly
advanced
steadily
he
says
the
entire
troop
behaved
with
great
coolness
and
obeyed
every
order
farrier
sherman
harris
wagoner
john
boland
and
private
elsie
jones
especially
distinguished
themselves
for
coolness
and
gallantry
the
aggressive
work
of
the
tenth
cavalry
therefore
appears
to
have
been
done
by
troops
b
and
i
a
detachment
of
the
former
troop
serving
the
hotchkiss
gun
battery
troop
i
was
commanded
by
lieutenant
fleming
and
by
him
conducted
to
the
front
although
he
admits
that
in
their
advance
up
the
slope
of
the
hill
he
could
see
but
very
few
of
the
men
at
a
time
and
declares
that
their
advance
was
certainly
steady
because
all
arrived
at
the
crest
of
the
hill
simultaneously
or
nearly
so
lieutenant
fleming
does
not
show
that
his
troop
of
excellent
men
were
in
any
sense
dependent
upon
their
white
officers
as
some
have
asserted
they
advanced
steadily
just
as
the
regulars
always
do
advanced
noiselessly
and
without
any
reckless
firing
and
reached
the
crest
of
the
hill
in
order
although
he
could
not
see
them
as
they
were
making
their
advance
they
kept
their
line
despite
all
the
obstructions
lieutenant
fleming
also
says
that
in
moving
to
his
position
he
passed
troop
b
which
then
inclined
to
the
right
and
during
the
remainder
of
the
action
was
on
my
right
troop
b
therefore
went
through
about
the
same
experience
as
troop
i
and
being
on
the
extreme
right
of
the
line
may
have
been
more
directly
in
front
of
that
foe
which
fleming
says
was
in
his
front
and
to
the
right
why
did
not
the
officer
who
directed
or
led
b
troop
in
its
advance
upon
the
enemy
report
the
action
of
his
troop
as
vividly
and
generously
as
did
lieutenant
fleming
the
men
of
troop
i
with
not
the
slightest
reflection
upon
the
gallant
officer
he
himself
has
the
manliness
to
say
he
was
so
unfortunate
as
to
lose
the
troop
the
troop
however
did
not
become
demoralized
but
went
into
action
under
command
of
its
first
sergeant
buck
and
remained
on
lieutenant
fleming
right
during
the
it
has
been
proven
more
than
once
that
should
the
commissioned
officers
of
a
company
or
troop
of
colored
regulars
be
killed
or
incapacitated
the
officers
can
carry
on
the
fight
speaking
of
this
same
regiment
it
is
equally
true
that
at
san
juan
the
officers
of
troops
d
and
g
were
all
shot
and
the
commands
of
these
troops
fell
to
their
first
sergeants
the
first
to
sergeant
william
given
the
second
to
sergeant
saint
foster
and
it
is
generally
understood
that
these
two
men
were
appointed
lieutenants
of
volunteers
because
of
their
success
in
handling
their
troops
in
battle
the
entire
attacking
force
at
this
end
of
the
line
if
we
count
only
those
engaged
in
actual
firing
consisted
of
two
troops
of
the
tenth
cavalry
and
two
of
the
first
cavalry
four
troops
while
to
the
left
the
entire
eight
troops
were
on
the
firing
line
the
action
of
the
troops
of
the
first
cavalry
was
quite
similar
to
that
of
the
troops
of
the
tenth
cavalry
and
equally
deserving
of
commendation
of
them
all
general
young
says
the
ground
over
which
the
right
column
advanced
was
a
mass
of
jungle
growth
with
wire
fences
not
to
be
seen
until
encountered
and
precipitous
heights
as
the
ridge
was
approached
it
was
impossible
for
the
troops
to
keep
in
touch
along
the
front
and
they
could
only
judge
of
the
enemy
from
the
sound
and
direction
of
his
fire
however
had
it
not
been
for
this
dense
jungle
the
attack
would
not
have
been
made
against
an
overwhelming
force
in
such
a
position
headway
was
so
difficult
that
advance
and
support
became
merged
and
moved
forward
under
a
continuous
volley
firing
supplemented
by
that
of
two
guns
return
firing
by
my
force
was
only
made
as
here
and
there
a
small
clear
spot
gave
a
sight
of
the
enemy
the
fire
discipline
of
these
particular
troops
was
almost
perfect
the
ammunition
expended
by
the
two
squadrons
engaged
in
an
incessant
advance
for
one
hour
and
fifteen
minutes
averaged
less
than
ten
rounds
per
man
the
fine
quality
of
these
troops
is
also
shown
by
the
fact
that
there
was
not
a
single
straggler
and
in
not
one
instance
was
an
attempt
made
by
any
soldier
to
fall
out
in
the
advance
to
assist
the
wounded
or
carry
back
the
dead
the
fighting
on
the
left
flank
was
equally
creditable
and
was
remarkable
and
i
believe
unprecedented
in
volunter
troops
so
quickly
raised
armed
and
equipped
the
five
hundred
men
of
colonel
wood
regiment
were
stretched
over
a
space
of
to
yards
and
were
entirely
without
support
or
reserve
and
appear
to
have
advanced
to
a
point
where
this
very
strong
force
on
the
right
swept
a
good
part
of
their
line
both
with
rifle
fire
and
the
fire
of
their
two
machine
guns
men
and
officers
were
falling
under
both
the
front
and
flank
fire
of
the
enemy
and
had
not
the
squadrons
of
the
first
and
tenth
made
their
successful
assault
upon
that
ridge
which
according
to
general
wood
report
was
very
strongly
held
the
situation
of
the
rough
riders
would
have
been
extreme
because
this
successful
assault
was
participated
in
by
the
tenth
cavalry
the
story
arose
that
the
rough
riders
were
rescued
by
that
regiment
the
fair
statement
would
be
that
the
regular
cavalry
consisting
of
a
squadron
of
the
first
and
a
squadron
of
the
tenth
made
their
advance
on
the
right
at
the
precise
moment
to
deliver
the
rough
riders
from
a
fire
that
threatened
their
annihilation
the
marksmanship
and
coolness
of
the
men
of
the
tenth
have
been
specially
commented
upon
and
their
fire
was
described
as
very
effective
but
the
same
remarks
could
be
made
of
the
men
of
the
first
who
fought
side
by
side
with
them
it
is
probable
that
the
volunteers
advanced
more
rapidly
than
did
the
regulars
using
more
ammunition
and
manifesting
a
very
high
degree
of
courage
and
enthusiasm
as
well
as
deliberation
but
the
regulars
reached
their
objective
at
the
proper
time
to
turn
the
battle
tide
each
advancing
column
was
worthy
to
be
companion
to
the
other
general
wheeler
said
the
fire
was
very
hot
for
about
an
hour
and
at
sent
a
courier
to
general
lawton
informing
him
that
he
was
engaged
with
a
larger
force
of
the
enemy
than
was
anticipated
and
asked
that
his
force
be
sent
forward
on
the
sevilla
road
as
quickly
as
possible
in
cuba
with
shafter
p
general
lawton
however
with
the
true
instinct
of
a
soldier
had
already
sent
orders
to
general
chaffee
to
move
forward
with
the
first
brigade
the
second
brigade
was
also
in
readiness
to
move
and
the
men
of
the
were
expecting
to
go
forward
to
take
a
position
on
the
right
and
if
possible
a
little
to
the
rear
of
the
spanish
entrenchments
in
order
to
cut
off
their
retreat
the
rapid
movements
of
the
cavalry
division
however
rendered
this
unnecessary
and
the
routing
of
the
foe
gave
to
the
americans
an
open
country
and
cleared
the
field
for
the
advance
on
santiago
the
first
battle
had
been
fought
and
the
americans
had
been
victorious
but
not
without
cost
sixteen
men
had
been
killed
and
wounded
in
colonel
wood
regiment
eight
had
been
killed
and
wounded
in
the
first
cavalry
seven
killed
and
eight
wounded
in
the
tenth
cavalry
one
killed
and
ten
wounded
the
percentage
of
losses
to
the
whole
strength
of
the
several
organizations
engaged
was
as
follows
rough
riders
over
per
cent
first
cavalry
over
per
cent
tenth
cavalry
per
cent
but
if
we
take
those
on
the
firing
line
as
the
base
the
rate
per
cent
of
losses
among
the
regulars
would
be
doubled
while
that
of
the
volunteers
would
remain
the
same
the
strength
of
the
enemy
in
this
battle
is
given
in
the
spanish
official
reports
according
to
lieutenant
miley
at
about
five
hundred
and
their
losses
are
put
at
nine
killed
and
wounded
at
the
time
of
the
fight
it
was
supposed
to
be
much
larger
general
young
report
places
the
estimates
at
and
adds
that
it
has
since
been
learned
from
spanish
sources
to
have
been
the
cuban
military
authorities
claim
the
spanish
strength
was
these
figures
are
doubtless
too
high
the
force
overtaken
at
las
guasimas
was
the
same
force
that
evacuated
siboney
at
the
approach
of
lawton
and
the
force
with
which
the
cubans
had
fought
on
the
morning
of
the
it
may
have
consisted
solely
of
the
garrison
from
siboney
although
it
is
more
probable
that
it
included
also
those
from
daiquiri
and
jutici
as
it
is
quite
certain
that
all
these
troops
proceeded
toward
santiago
over
the
same
road
the
force
at
siboney
had
been
given
by
the
cubans
at
at
daiquiri
at
and
at
jutici
at
if
these
had
concentrated
and
the
figures
were
correct
the
spanish
force
at
guasimas
was
upwards
of
if
however
it
was
the
force
from
siboney
alone
it
was
about
as
the
spanish
official
report
gives
it
on
this
latter
basis
however
the
losses
are
out
of
proportion
for
while
the
attacking
party
lost
a
little
less
than
per
cent
of
its
entire
strength
in
killed
and
wounded
the
losses
of
the
entrenched
defending
party
were
even
a
little
greater
or
over
per
cent
of
its
strength
it
is
therefore
probable
that
the
spanish
force
was
greater
than
officially
reported
and
included
the
troops
from
the
other
posts
as
well
as
those
from
siboney
the
engagement
was
classed
by
general
shafter
as
unimportant
although
its
effect
upon
our
army
was
inspiring
it
did
not
cut
off
the
retreat
of
the
spanish
force
and
the
men
who
faced
our
army
at
guasimas
met
them
again
in
the
trenches
before
santiago
general
shafter
desired
to
advance
with
his
whole
force
and
cautioned
strongly
against
any
further
forward
movement
until
the
troops
were
well
in
hand
the
two
battles
between
the
cubans
and
spaniards
fought
on
the
in
which
the
cubans
had
sixteen
men
wounded
and
two
killed
were
engagements
of
some
consequence
although
we
have
no
reports
of
them
there
is
no
evidence
that
the
cubans
took
part
in
the
battle
of
guasimas
although
they
arrived
on
the
grounds
immediately
after
the
firing
ceased
the
story
thus
far
told
is
as
the
reader
can
not
fail
to
see
directly
from
official
records
and
the
conclusions
arrived
at
are
those
which
result
naturally
from
the
facts
as
therein
detailed
not
one
word
is
quoted
from
any
but
military
men
actors
in
the
affair
we
may
now
go
briefly
over
the
same
ground
giving
the
views
and
conclusions
of
able
civilian
correspondents
who
followed
the
army
to
see
what
was
done
and
who
were
trained
observers
and
skilled
writers
how
have
these
able
war
journalists
told
the
story
of
las
guasimas
to
quote
from
stephen
bonsal
in
substance
not
in
words
is
to
contradict
what
general
shafter
says
officially
in
one
particular
but
in
no
such
way
as
to
discredit
the
general
or
to
weaken
bonsal
it
is
not
a
case
of
bringing
two
universal
antagonistic
propositions
face
to
face
but
a
case
where
two
men
of
different
training
look
upon
an
action
from
different
standpoints
and
through
different
general
shafter
says
of
the
collision
of
the
rough
riders
with
the
spanish
force
there
was
no
ambush
as
reported
as
a
military
man
he
says
there
was
no
more
concealment
on
the
part
of
the
spanish
force
than
what
an
attacking
party
should
expect
no
more
than
what
is
usual
in
modern
warfare
hence
he
does
not
regard
it
as
an
ambush
and
does
not
officially
take
notice
of
any
surprise
or
unexpected
encounter
on
the
part
of
his
force
to
do
so
would
be
to
reflect
however
slightly
upon
the
professional
skill
of
the
commander
of
the
left
column
general
shafter
thus
says
officially
in
a
manly
way
there
was
no
ambush
beyond
this
his
duty
does
not
call
him
to
go
and
he
halts
his
expressions
exactly
at
this
line
maintaining
in
his
attitude
all
the
attributes
of
the
true
soldier
placing
himself
beyond
criticism
by
thus
securing
from
attack
the
character
of
his
subordinate
bonsal
is
a
writer
and
author
accustomed
to
view
actions
in
the
broader
light
of
popular
judgment
entirely
free
from
professional
bias
and
having
no
or
obligations
to
serve
his
pen
is
not
official
his
statements
are
not
from
the
military
standpoint
not
influenced
in
any
way
by
considerations
of
personal
weal
or
woe
with
respect
to
others
or
himself
he
says
that
one
troop
of
the
rough
riders
troop
l
commanded
by
captain
capron
was
leading
the
advance
of
the
regiment
and
was
in
solid
formation
and
within
yards
of
its
scouting
line
when
it
received
the
enemy
fire
this
troop
was
so
far
in
the
advance
that
it
took
the
other
troops
of
the
regiment
more
than
a
half
hour
to
get
up
to
it
the
writer
speaks
of
the
advance
of
that
troop
as
having
been
made
in
the
formation
of
a
solid
column
along
a
narrow
trail
which
brought
them
in
the
way
i
have
described
within
range
of
the
spanish
rifles
and
within
the
unobstructed
sweep
of
their
machine
guns
he
sums
up
as
follows
and
if
it
is
to
be
ambushed
when
you
receive
the
enemy
fire
perhaps
a
quarter
of
an
hour
before
it
was
expected
and
when
the
troop
was
in
a
formation
and
the
only
one
in
which
in
view
of
the
nature
of
the
ground
it
was
possible
to
advance
quickly
then
most
certainly
l
troop
of
the
rough
riders
was
ambushed
by
the
spaniards
on
the
morning
of
june
bonsal
also
brings
into
clear
view
the
part
taken
in
this
battle
by
lawton
infantry
he
shows
by
means
of
a
simple
map
the
trail
by
which
miles
brigade
in
which
was
the
infantry
moved
in
order
to
flank
the
spanish
position
while
chaffee
brigade
was
hurrying
forward
on
the
royal
road
to
reinforce
the
line
in
front
a
letter
from
a
soldier
of
the
written
soon
after
these
events
fully
confirms
bonsal
in
what
he
says
concerning
the
movement
of
miles
brigade
the
soldier
says
on
the
morning
of
the
the
rough
riders
tenth
and
first
cavalry
were
to
make
an
attack
on
a
little
place
where
the
spanish
were
fortified
the
second
brigade
was
to
come
on
the
right
flank
of
these
troops
and
a
little
in
rear
of
the
fortifications
but
by
some
misunderstanding
the
former
troops
led
by
the
rough
riders
made
an
attack
before
we
got
our
position
and
the
result
was
a
great
many
lives
lost
in
the
first
cavalry
and
rough
riders
only
one
in
tenth
cavalry
but
many
wounded
they
captured
the
fortification
this
letter
by
a
humble
soldier
written
with
no
thought
of
its
importance
shows
how
gallantly
lawton
had
sprung
to
the
rescue
of
wheeler
division
according
to
bonsal
who
says
he
obtained
his
information
from
spanish
officers
who
were
present
in
this
fight
it
was
the
information
of
the
approach
of
this
brigade
and
of
chaffee
up
the
main
road
that
caused
the
spaniards
to
withdraw
rapidly
from
the
position
the
whole
force
was
in
imminent
danger
of
being
captured
another
soldier
of
the
wrote
the
report
came
that
the
infantry
was
to
cut
off
the
spanish
retreat
from
a
stronghold
toward
santiago
these
glimpses
from
soldiers
letters
illustrate
how
clearly
they
comprehended
the
work
upon
which
they
were
sent
and
show
also
how
hearty
and
cordial
was
the
support
which
the
infantry
at
that
time
was
hurrying
forward
to
the
advancing
cavalry
the
official
reports
show
that
the
strength
of
the
spanish
position
was
before
the
right
of
our
line
bonsal
says
directly
in
front
of
the
tenth
cavalry
rose
undoubtedly
the
strongest
point
in
the
spanish
position
two
lines
of
shallow
trenches
strengthened
by
heavy
stone
parapets
we
must
remember
that
so
far
as
we
can
get
the
disposition
of
these
troops
from
official
records
troop
a
connected
the
rough
riders
with
the
first
cavalry
and
troops
i
and
b
were
on
the
right
of
the
first
cavalry
troop
a
did
not
fire
a
shot
the
fighting
therefore
was
done
by
troops
i
and
b
on
the
extreme
right
of
the
line
and
it
was
on
their
front
that
undoubtedly
the
strongest
point
in
the
spanish
position
lay
nor
should
the
reader
forget
that
at
this
very
important
moment
troop
b
was
commanded
by
its
first
sergeant
buck
lieutenant
williard
having
by
his
own
report
been
unfortunate
enough
to
lose
the
troop
this
is
said
with
no
disparagement
to
lieutenant
williard
it
was
merely
one
of
the
accidents
of
battle
says
bonsal
the
moment
the
advance
was
ordered
the
black
troopers
of
the
tenth
cavalry
forged
ahead
they
were
no
braver
certainly
than
any
other
men
in
the
line
but
their
better
training
enabled
them
to
render
more
valuable
services
than
the
other
troops
engaged
they
had
with
them
and
ready
for
action
their
machine
guns
and
shoved
them
right
up
to
the
front
on
the
firing
line
from
where
they
poured
very
effective
fire
into
the
spanish
trenches
which
not
only
did
considerable
execution
but
was
particularly
effective
in
keeping
down
the
return
fire
of
the
spaniards
the
machine
guns
of
the
rough
riders
were
mislaid
or
the
mules
upon
which
they
had
been
loaded
could
not
be
found
at
this
juncture
it
was
said
they
had
bolted
it
is
certain
however
that
the
guns
were
not
brought
into
action
and
consequently
the
spaniards
suffered
less
and
the
rough
riders
more
in
the
gallant
charge
they
made
up
the
hill
in
front
of
them
after
the
tenth
cavalry
had
advanced
and
driven
the
spaniards
from
their
position
on
the
right
corporal
johnson
b
troop
was
the
officer
in
charge
of
the
machine
guns
during
the
brief
fight
at
las
guasimas
and
his
action
was
such
as
to
call
forth
from
the
troop
commander
special
mention
for
his
efficiency
and
perfect
coolness
under
fire
here
i
may
be
pardoned
for
calling
attention
to
a
notion
too
prevalent
concerning
the
negro
soldier
in
time
of
battle
he
is
too
often
represented
as
going
into
action
singing
like
a
zany
or
yelling
like
a
demon
rather
than
as
a
man
calculating
the
chances
for
life
and
victory
the
official
reports
from
the
black
regulars
in
cuba
ought
to
correct
this
notion
every
troop
and
company
commander
who
has
reported
upon
colored
soldiers
in
that
war
speaks
of
the
coolness
of
the
men
of
his
command
captain
beck
of
troop
a
tenth
cavalry
in
the
guasimas
fight
says
i
will
add
that
the
enlisted
men
of
troop
a
tenth
cavalry
behaved
well
silently
and
alertly
obeying
orders
and
without
becoming
excited
when
the
fire
of
the
enemy
reached
them
the
yell
in
the
charge
of
the
regulars
is
a
part
of
the
action
and
is
no
more
peculiar
to
negro
troops
than
to
the
whites
only
as
they
may
differ
in
the
general
timbre
of
voice
black
american
soldiers
when
not
on
duty
may
sing
more
than
white
troops
but
in
quite
a
long
experience
among
them
i
have
not
found
the
difference
so
very
noticeable
in
all
garrisons
one
will
find
some
men
more
musically
inclined
than
others
some
who
love
to
sing
and
some
who
do
not
some
who
have
voices
adapted
to
the
production
of
musical
tones
and
some
who
have
not
and
it
is
doubtless
owing
to
these
constitutional
differences
that
we
find
differences
in
habits
and
expressions
lieutenant
miley
of
general
shafter
staff
in
his
description
of
the
departure
of
general
shatter
from
general
garcia
tent
gives
us
a
glimpse
of
the
character
of
the
men
that
composed
the
cuban
army
in
that
vicinity
while
the
interview
was
going
on
the
troops
were
being
assembled
to
do
honor
to
the
general
on
his
departure
several
companies
were
drawn
up
in
front
of
the
tent
to
present
arms
as
he
came
out
and
a
regiment
escorted
him
to
the
beach
down
the
winding
path
which
was
now
lined
on
both
sides
by
cuban
soldiers
standing
about
a
yard
apart
and
presenting
arms
the
scene
made
a
strong
impression
on
all
in
the
party
there
seemed
to
be
such
an
earnestness
and
fixedness
of
purpose
displayed
that
all
felt
these
soldiers
to
be
a
power
about
fifty
per
cent
were
blacks
and
the
rest
mulattoes
with
a
small
number
of
whites
they
were
very
poorly
clad
many
without
shirts
or
shoes
but
every
man
had
his
gun
and
a
belt
full
of
ammunition
b
extract
from
a
letter
from
a
soldier
of
the
cavalry
troop
b
concerning
the
battle
of
las
guasimas
the
platoon
which
escaped
this
ditch
got
on
the
right
of
the
cavalry
on
the
firing
line
and
pushed
steadily
forward
under
first
sergeant
buck
being
then
in
two
squads
one
under
sergeant
thompson
on
account
of
the
nature
of
the
ground
and
other
natural
obstacles
there
were
men
not
connected
with
any
squads
but
who
advanced
with
the
line
both
squads
fired
by
volley
and
at
will
at
the
command
of
the
sergeants
named
and
their
shots
reached
the
enemy
and
were
effective
as
it
is
generally
believed
private
bunn
of
sergeant
thompson
squad
is
reported
to
have
shot
a
sharpshooter
from
a
tree
just
in
front
of
the
enemy
work
private
wheeler
was
shot
twice
in
the
advance
sergeant
thompson
squad
was
once
stopped
from
firing
by
general
wheeler
for
fear
of
hitting
the
rough
riders
it
seems
that
two
distinct
battles
were
fought
that
day
colonel
wood
command
struck
the
enemy
at
about
the
tame
time
or
probably
a
little
before
ours
did
and
all
unknown
to
the
men
in
our
ranks
and
got
themselves
into
a
pretty
tight
squeeze
about
the
same
time
our
force
engaged
the
enemy
and
drew
part
of
the
attention
they
were
giving
the
rough
riders
this
the
latter
claimed
enabled
them
to
continue
the
movement
on
the
enemy
works
but
as
our
command
had
an
equal
number
of
and
cavalrymen
i
am
of
the
opinion
that
the
story
of
our
saving
the
rough
riders
arose
from
the
fact
that
as
soon
as
the
fight
was
over
the
regular
cavalry
was
opening
its
arms
to
us
declaring
that
we
especially
b
troop
had
saved
them
for
the
regular
cavalry
was
first
in
the
attack
in
general
young
command
and
when
the
enemy
began
to
make
it
pretty
warm
he
ordered
b
and
i
troops
of
the
forward
on
the
right
troop
b
was
in
the
lead
and
the
alacrity
with
which
these
two
troops
moved
to
the
front
has
always
been
praised
by
the
cavalry
and
they
declare
that
that
movement
helped
them
wonderfully
in
making
this
movement
my
troop
had
three
or
four
men
wounded
and
later
when
sergeant
thompson
squad
was
fighting
far
to
the
front
it
had
in
it
several
members
of
the
cavalry
who
are
always
glad
to
praise
him
so
i
think
that
by
the
rough
riders
first
attributing
their
success
or
their
rescue
from
inevitable
defeat
to
the
attack
made
by
our
command
and
by
the
regular
very
generously
in
the
heat
of
success
bestowing
upon
us
the
honors
of
the
day
it
finally
became
a
settled
thing
that
we
saved
the
whole
battle
that
evening
after
the
battle
i
was
met
by
lieutenant
shipp
later
killed
at
san
juan
hill
who
on
inquiring
and
being
told
that
i
belonged
to
troop
b
congratulated
me
on
its
conduct
and
said
it
had
made
a
name
for
the
regiment
lieutenant
shipp
was
not
in
that
fight
but
had
come
up
after
it
was
over
and
had
heard
of
us
through
the
cavalry

over

years
in

a
man
of

character
an
experienced
horseman
and
packer
and
so
commanded
a
portion
of
the
firing
line
in

remarks
of
praise
from

the

while
the

was
going

in

the

took
so
conspicuous
a
part
the

still
remained
on

the
city

awaiting
orders
to
land
during
the
night
of
the
such
orders
were
received
by
the
authorities

and
they
were
directed
to
land
their
troops
but
the
general
commanding
kent
did
not
hear
of
the
matter
until
some
time
the
next
morning
he
relates
the
following
circumstances
in
his
official
report
of
the
debarkation
at
of
the

cardin
of

came
aboard
with
orders

this
officer
also
handed
me
a
letter
from
the
corps
commander
expressing
his
astonishment
that
i
had
remained
away
three
days
general
kent
also
states
in
his
report
that
his
travel
rations
had
been
exhausted
seven
days
before
and
that
but
one
meal
of
field
rations
remained
and
that
the
ship
supply
both
of
water
and
provisions
was
running
low
and
that
in
consequence
of
these
facts
as
well
as
for
higher
considerations
he
was
very
anxious
to
get
on
shore
the
debarkation
followed
as
rapidly
as
possible
and
that
afternoon
general
kent
reported
in
person
to
wheeler
the
troops
bivouacking
for
the
night
near
the
landing
the
next
day
colonel
pearson
who
commanded
the
second
brigade
of
kent
division
took
the
second
infantry
and
reconnoitred
along
the
railroad
toward
the
morro
going
a
distance
of
about
six
miles
and
returning
in
the
evening
having
found
no
enemy
in
that
vicinity
although
evidences
were
found
that
a
force
had
recently
retreated
from
a
blockhouse
situated
on
the
railroad
about
two
miles
from
aguadores
on
the
day
following
june
the
entire
division
moved
out
on
the
road
toward
santiago
and
encamped
on
the
same
ground
that
lawton
had
occupied
the
night
previous
the
second
brigade
took
its
place
near
savilla
while
the
third
brigade
which
included
the
infantry
went
into
camp
at
las
guasimas
where
the
affair
of
the
had
occurred
the
order
of
march
had
now
partially
fallen
back
to
the
original
plan
lawton
in
advance
with
whom
was
the
infantry
wheeler
next
with
whom
was
the
ninth
and
tenth
cavalry
and
kent
in
the
rear
who
had
as
we
have
just
related
the
infantry
in
his
third
brigade
in
this
order
the
army
moved
so
far
as
it
moved
at
all
until
the
morning
of
the
when
dispositions
for
the
general
attack
began
the
story
of
the
great
battle
or
as
it
turned
out
of
the
two
great
battles
begins
on
this
day
and
the
careers
of
the
four
colored
regiments
are
to
be
followed
through
the
divisions
of
lawton
kent
and
wheeler
let
us
begin
however
with
general
shafter
official
report
and
his
story
of
santiago
as
told
in
the
century
of
february
from
these
sources
it
is
learned
that
on
june
general
shafter
reconnoitered
the
country
about
santiago
and
determined
upon
a
plan
of
attack
ascending
a
hill
from
which
he
could
obtain
a
good
view
of
the
city
and
could
also
see
san
juan
hill
and
the
country
about
el
caney
he
observed
afresh
what
had
impressed
itself
upon
all
immediately
upon
landing
to
wit
that
in
all
this
country
there
were
no
good
roads
along
which
to
move
troops
or
transport
supplies
the
general
says
i
had
never
seen
a
good
road
in
a
spanish
country
and
santiago
did
not
disappoint
my
expectations
the
roads
as
he
saw
them
from
the
summit
of
the
hill
on
june
were
very
poor
and
indeed
little
better
than
bridle
paths
except
between
el
caney
and
san
juan
river
and
the
city
within
this
region
a
distance
of
from
four
to
four
and
a
half
miles
the
roads
were
passable
el
caney
lay
about
four
miles
northeast
of
santiago
and
was
strongly
fortified
and
as
events
proved
strongly
garrisoned
this
position
was
of
great
importance
to
the
enemy
because
from
it
a
force
might
come
to
attack
the
right
flank
and
rear
of
the
american
army
as
it
should
make
its
attempt
on
san
juan
hill
el
caney
held
the
road
from
guantanamo
at
which
point
an
important
spanish
force
was
posted
while
general
shafter
was
surveying
the
country
from
the
hill
at
el
pozo
and
making
what
special
examination
he
could
of
the
country
toward
san
juan
hills
generals
lawton
and
chaffee
were
making
a
reconnoisance
around
el
caney
from
general
lawton
report
it
would
appear
that
the
work
of
reconnoitering
around
el
caney
was
done
chiefly
by
general
chaffee
he
says
to
general
adna
chaffee
i
am
indebted
for
a
thorough
and
intelligent
reconnoissance
of
the
town
of
el
caney
and
vicinity
prior
to
the
battle
and
the
submission
of
a
plan
of
attack
which
was
adopted
i
consider
general
chaffee
one
of
the
best
practical
soldiers
in
the
army
and
recommend
him
for
special
distinction
for
successfully
charging
the
stone
fort
mentioned
in
this
report
the
capture
of
which
practically
closed
the
battle
the
general
plan
of
attack
as
explained
by
general
shafter
himself
in
his
century
article
was
to
put
a
brigade
on
the
road
between
santiago
and
el
caney
to
keep
the
spaniards
at
the
latter
place
from
retreating
on
the
city
and
then
with
the
rest
of
lawton
division
and
the
divisions
of
wheeler
and
kent
and
bates
brigade
to
attack
the
spanish
position
in
front
of
santiago
before
that
he
had
said
that
he
wished
to
put
a
division
in
on
the
right
of
el
caney
and
assault
the
town
on
that
road
to
admiral
sampson
on
june
he
said
i
shall
if
i
can
put
a
large
force
in
caney
and
one
perhaps
still
farther
west
near
the
conveying
water
to
the
city
making
my
main
attack
from
the
northeast
and
east
his
desire
at
this
time
was
to
get
the
enemy
in
my
front
and
the
city
at
my
back
on
june
he
had
modified
this
plan
so
as
to
decide
to
place
one
brigade
on
the
road
between
el
caney
and
santiago
with
a
view
merely
to
keeping
the
el
caney
garrison
from
retreating
into
santiago
as
he
was
explaining
his
plan
to
the
division
officers
and
others
on
the
afternoon
of
the
at
his
own
headquarters
lawton
and
chaffee
were
of
the
opinion
that
they
could
dispose
of
the
spaniards
at
el
caney
in
two
hours
time
therefore
says
the
general
i
modified
my
plan
assigning
lawton
whole
division
for
the
attack
of
el
caney
and
directed
bates
independent
brigade
to
his
support
this
last
modification
of
general
shafter
plan
was
made
in
deference
to
the
opinion
of
subordinates
and
was
based
upon
observations
made
especially
by
general
chaffee
the
force
assigned
for
the
reduction
of
el
caney
was
to
begin
its
work
early
in
the
morning
and
by
ten
or
eleven
at
the
outside
it
was
expected
that
the
task
would
be
accomplished
and
lawton
would
join
kent
and
sumner
in
the
assault
upon
san
juan
early
on
the
morning
of
july
capron
battery
was
got
into
position
on
a
line
running
directly
north
from
marianage
on
a
hill
about
five
hundred
yards
east
of
las
guasimas
creek
lawton
division
began
its
move
on
the
afternoon
of
the
as
did
in
fact
the
whole
army
and
bivouacked
that
night
near
el
pozo
the
infantry
which
belonged
to
the
second
brigade
commanded
by
colonel
miles
a
former
major
of
the
left
el
pozo
at
daylight
by
way
of
the
road
leading
almost
due
north
and
marched
about
one
mile
to
the
little
town
of
marianage
here
a
halt
was
made
for
an
hour
from
to
during
which
time
reconnoitering
parties
were
sent
out
to
examine
the
ground
toward
the
ducoureau
house
which
lay
about
one
mile
to
the
northward
of
marianage
and
which
had
been
designated
by
general
lawton
as
a
general
rendezvous
after
the
engagement
should
terminate
reconnoissance
was
made
also
to
the
front
for
the
purpose
of
discovering
the
enemy
and
to
ascertain
the
left
of
ludlow
brigade
this
was
the
first
brigade
of
lawton
division
and
consisted
of
the
eighth
and
infantry
and
the
second
massachusetts
the
last
named
regiment
being
on
the
right
the
second
brigade
was
to
connect
with
this
on
its
right
and
succeeded
in
finding
the
position
of
the
second
massachusetts
during
this
halt
at
miles
brigade
was
ordered
to
take
position
on
the
right
of
ludlow
brigade
which
it
did
in
the
following
order
the
fourth
infantry
on
the
left
joining
with
the
second
massachusetts
on
ludlow
right
the
on
the
right
with
its
left
joining
on
the
fourth
infantry
we
must
now
review
the
progress
of
the
battle
so
far
as
it
is
possible
to
do
so
from
the
firing
of
the
first
shot
by
capron
battery
up
to
an
hour
long
after
the
time
at
which
it

he
says
that
the

continued
its
fire
against
specified
objectives
intermittently
throughout
the
day
under
the
personal
direction
of
the
division
commander
the
forces
we
have
so
far
considered
consisting
of
ludlow
and
miles
brigades
and
of
capron
battery
lay
to
the
south
of
caney
between
it
and
santiago
ludlow
brigade
having
been
placed
there
to
cut
off
the
retreat
of
the
garrison
should
it
attempt
to
escape
up
to
there
had
been
no
call
for
employing
it
for
that
purpose
the
garrison
had
made
no
attempt
to
escape
we
must
now
go
around
to
the
east
and
north
of
caney
here
the
third
brigade
consisting
of
the
seventh
twelfth
and
seventeenth
infantry
was
posted
and
early
in
the
morning
joined
in
the
attack
the
brigade
getting
under
fire
before
eight
colonel
carpenter
of
the
seventh
regiment
says
that
one
company
of
his
regiment
by
general
chaffee
direction
was
detached
and
sent
forward
to
reduce
a
blockhouse
well
up
on
the
hill
which
commanded
the
approach
of
his
regiment
to
the
field
of
action
after
several
ineffectual
attempts
by
the
company
the
captain
van
orsdale
was
directed
to
abandon
the
undertaking
and
rejoin
the
regiment
which
then
took
up
a
position
on
the
crest
of
a
hill
running
nearly
parallel
with
the
spanish
lines
from
this
position
the
men
crawled
forward
about
fifty
yards
and
opened
a
deliberate
fire
upon
the
enemy
keeping
it
up
for
about
an
hour
but
as
the
losses
of
the
regiment
at
this
time
were
considerable
and
the
fire
seemed
to
be
without
material
effect
the
command
was
withdrawn
to
its
position
on
the
hill
where
it
found
protection
in
a
sunken
road
in
this
condition
this
regiment
lay
when
capron
battery
made
its
lull
at
the
fearful
fire
this
regiment
met
can
be
estimated
by
the
losses
it
sustained
which
during
the
day
were
as
follows
killed
officer
and
enlisted
men
wounded
officers
and
enlisted
men
missing
enlisted
men
the
seventeenth
regiment
went
into
action
on
the
right
of
the
seventh
doing
but
little
firing
as
their
orders
were
not
to
open
fire
unless
they
could
make
the
fire
effective
companies
c
and
g
fired
a
few
volleys
the
remainder
of
the
regiment
did
not
fire
at
all
four
enlisted
men
were
killed
and
two
officers
severely
wounded
one
lieutenant
dickinson
dying
from
his
wounds
within
a
few
hours
several
enlisted
men
were
also
wounded
at
this
regiment
was
lying
on
the
right
of
the
seventh
the
twelfth
regiment
began
firing
between
and
in
the
morning
and
advanced
to
take
its
position
on
the
left
of
the
seventh
infantry
this
regiment
early
reached
a
position
within
yards
of
the
enemy
in
which
it
found
shelter
in
the
sunken
road
free
from
the
enemy
fire
the
regiment
remained
in
this
position
until
about
in
the
afternoon
and
hence
was
there
at
the
losses
of
this
regiment
during
the
day
were
killed
enlisted
men
wounded
officers
and
enlisted
men
from
these
brief
sketches
the
reader
will
now
be
able
to
grasp
the
position
of
lawton
entire
division
beginning
on
the
south
from
the
west
with
ludlow
brigade
consisting
of
the
eighth
and
second
massachusetts
the
line
was
continued
by
miles
brigade
of
the
fourth
and
infantry
then
passing
over
a
considerable
space
we
strike
chaffee
brigade
posted
as
has
just
been
described
general
bates
brigade
probably
arrived
upon
the
field
about
noon
this
brigade
consisted
of
the
third
and
twentieth
infantry
and
is
known
as
bates
independent
brigade
the
brigade
is
reported
as
going
into
action
about
and
continuing
in
action
until
it
took
a
position
on
the
right
partially
filling
up
the
gap
between
miles
and
chaffee
the
first
battalion
of
the
twentieth
infantry
went
into
action
on
the
left
of
the
firing
line
and
one
company
a
took
part
in
the
latter
part
of
the
charge
by
which
the
stone
house
was
taken
between
when
capron
firing
stopped
and
when
miles
brigade
was
moved
forward
to
join
the
right
of
ludlow
and
when
the
battery
recommenced
the
troops
including
bates
brigade
were
either
in
the
positions
described
above
or
were
moving
to
them
noon
had
arrived
and
el
caney
is
not
taken
the
garrison
has
not
attempted
to
escape
but
is
sending
out
upon
its
assailants
a
continuous
and
deadly
fire
throughout
the
heaviest
din
of
our
fire
says
colonel
carpenter
could
be
heard
the
peculiar
ring
of
the
defiant
enemy
shots
twelve
on
july
was
a
most
anxious
hour
for
our
army
in
cuba
the
battle
at
el
caney
was
at
a
standstill
and
the
divisions
of
kent
and
sumner
were
in
a
most
perilous
situation
description
of
the
state
of
the
battle
at
that
time
is
pathetic
speaking
of
the
artillery
at
el
caney
capron
battery
he
says
it
was
now
apparent
that
this
artillery
firing
from
its
position
of
hundred
yards
could
do
very
little
damage
to
the
great
stone
fort
and
earthworks
north
of
the
village
the
shots
were
too
few
and
the
metal
used
too
light
to
be
effectual
three
hours
of
the
morning
had
worn
away
and
the
advance
of
our
men
had
been
slowly
made
and
at
great
cost
all
the
approaches
were
commanded
by
spanish
entrenchments
and
the
fighting
was
very
unequal
a
soldier
of
the
says
that
when
he
came
in
sight
of
the
battle
at
el
caney
the
americans
were
gaining
no
ground
and
the
flashes
of
the
spanish
mausers
told
us
that
the
forces
engaged
were
unequally
matched
the
difference
of
position
favoring
the
spaniards
this
view
was
had
about
noon
or
soon
after
at
that
time
a
succession
of
aides
and
staff
officers
came
galloping
from
headquarters
with
messages
which
plainly
showed
that
confusion
if
not
disaster
had
befallen
the
two
divisions
which
by
the
heavy
firing
we
had
learned
to
our
great
surprise
had
become
warmly
engaged
in
the
centre
the
orders
to
general
lawton
from
headquarters
were
at
first
peremptory
in
character
he
was
to
pull
out
of
his
fight
and
to
move
his
division
to
the
support
of
the
centre
bonsal
this
call
for
lawton
arose
from
the
fact
that
about
noon
general
shafter
received
several
dispatches
from
sumner
of
the
cavalry
division
requiring
assistance
general
sumner
felt
the
need
of
the
assistance
of
every
available
man
in
the
centre
of
the
line
where
he
was
carrying
on
his
fight
with
the
spaniards
on
blue
house
hill
this
situation
so
impressed
the
general
shafter
that
he
finally
wrote
to
lawton
you
must
proceed
with
the
remainder
of
your
force
and
join
on
immediately
upon
sumner
right
if
you
do
not
the
battle
is
lost
shafter
idea
then
was
to
fall
back
to
his
original
plan
of
just
leaving
enough
troops
at
el
caney
to
prevent
the
garrison
from
going
to
the
assistance
of
any
other
part
of
the
line
shafter
himself
says
as
the
fight
progressed
i
was
impressed
with
the
fact
that
we
were
meeting
with
a
very
stubborn
resistance
at
el
caney
and
i
began
to
fear
that
i
had
made
a
mistake
in
making
two
fights
in
one
day
and
sent
major
noble
with
orders
to
lawton
to
hasten
with
his
troops
along
the
caney
road
placing
himself
on
the
right
of
wheeler
sumner
lawton
now
made
a
general
advance
and
it
is
important
to
see
just
what
troops
did
advance
the
seventh
infantry
did
not
move
for
carpenter
says
that
after
withdrawing
to
the
partial
cover
furnished
by
the
road
the
regiment
occupied
this
position
from
until
about
the
seventeenth
did
not
move
for
captain
commanding
says
the
regiment
took
a
position
joining
its
left
with
the
right
of
the
seventh
infantry
and
that
the
regiment
remained
in
this
position
until
the
battle
was
over
the
twelfth
infantry
remained
in
its
shelter
within
yards
of
the
stone
fort
until
about
then
we
have
chaffee
brigade
on
the
north
of
the
fort
remaining
stationary
and
by
their
own
reports
doing
but
little
firing
the
seventeenth
fired
for
about
fifty
minutes
about
noon
with
remarkable
precision
but
it
seemingly
had
no
effect
upon
reducing
the
spanish
fire
delivered
in
our
their
front
the
seventh
did
not
fire
to
any
extent
the
twelfth
infantry
lay
in
its
refuge
free
from
the
fire
and
may
have
kept
up
an
irregular
fire
about
this
time
bates
brigade
entered
the
field
and
one
battalion
of
the
twentieth
infantry
is
reported
to
have
joined
the
left
of
the
firing
line
of
the
general
ludlow
says
there
was
a
lull
from
to
when
the
action
again
became
violent
and
at
the
third
brigade
captured
the
stone
fort
with
a
rush
and
hoisted
the
american
flag
from
ludlow
brigade
captain
van
horne
commanding
the
infantry
after
the
wounding
of
patterson
says
that
the
first
battalion
of
his
regiment
took
a
position
about
yards
from
the
town
and
kept
up
firing
until
the
place
surrendered
he
does
not
say
positively
that
the
firing
was
upon
the
town
but
he
had
said
just
before
that
the
second
battalion
slowly
moved
forward
firing
into
the
town
from
the
left
so
that
we
may
readily
conclude
from
the
context
as
well
as
from
the
position
that
the
first
battalion
fired
into
the
town
also
hence
it
seems
fair
to
exclude
from
the
fort
all
of
ludlow
brigade
and
it
is
observable
that
ludlow
himself
claims
no
part
in
the
capture
of
that
stronghold
general
bates
says
his
brigade
took
position
to
the
right
of
colonel
miles
brigade
and
pushed
rapidly
to
the
front
he
then
says
that
after
remaining
sometime
in
the
crossroad
to
the
right
of
brigade
under
a
heavy
fire
from
the
enemy
the
brigade
moved
farther
to
the
right
to
the
assault
of
a
small
hill
occupied
upon
the
top
by
a
stone
fort
and
well
protected
by
rifle
pits
general
brigade
charged
them
from
the
right
and
the
two
brigades
joining
upon
the
crest
opened
fire
from
this
point
of
vantage
lately
occupied
by
the
spanish
upon
the
village
of
el
caney
general
chaffee
says
it
was
in
consequence
of
the
fire
of
general
bates
troops
upon
the
fort
that
the
assault
by
the
twelfth
infantry
was
postponed
in
general
chaffee
report
this
statement
occurs
the
action
lasted
nearly
throughout
the
day
terminating
at
about
at
which
time
the
stone
blockhouse
was
assaulted
by
captain
haskell
battalion
of
the
twelfth
infantry
under
the
personal
direction
of
comba
commanding
the
regiment
the
resistance
at
this
point
had
been
greatly
affected
by
the
fire
of
capron
battery
a
few
moments
after
the
seizure
of
this
point
the
key
to
the
situation
my
left
was
joined
by
general
bates
with
a
portion
of
his
command
it
is
to
be
noted
in
connection
with
all
of
the
above
statements
that
major
mccaskey
who
commanded
the
twentieth
infantry
bates
brigade
says
the
first
battalion
was
moved
to
the
right
and
put
into
action
on
the
left
of
the
infantry
firing
line
and
one
company
a
took
part
in
the
latter
part
of
the
charge
by
which
the
stone
house
was
taken
the
two
points
to
be
noted
here
are
that
this
battalion
was
on
the
left
of
the
firing
line
and
that
one
company
took
part
in
the
charge
upon
the
stone
house
when
chaffee
brigade
charged
the
stone
house
from
the
right
some
of
bates
troops
at
least
this
company
a
from
the
battalion
near
the
firing
line
of
the
infantry
took
part
in
the
latter
part
of
the
charge
the
two
brigades
bates
and
chaffee
joined
immediately
after
the
capture
of
the
stone
fort
and
opened
fire
upon
the
town
we
have
now
traced
the
actions
and
the
fortunes
of
the
three
following
brigades
ludlow
chaffee
and
bates
but
what
has
become
of
brigade
unfortunately
the
second
brigade
has
not
been
so
well
reported
as
were
the
others
engaged
in
the
action
at
el
caney
we
have
seen
that
it
was
ordered
to
take
position
on
the
right
of
brigade
at
when
capron
battery
ceased
its
firing
for
the
fifty
minutes
we
were
detained
in
reaching
our
position
by
troops
in
our
front
blocking
the
road
says
the
brigade
commander
we
came
into
action
directly
in
front
of
the
stone
blockhouse
at
and
from
that
hour
until
about
when
the
command
firing
was
given
the
blockhouse
having
been
captured
my
command
was
continuously
under
fire
the
reader
will
note
in
this
report
that
the
brigade
went
into
action
at
several
hours
before
the
charge
was
ordered
by
general
chaffee
and
at
least
an
hour
and
a
half
before
according
to
the
report
of
the
commander
of
the
third
brigade
this
fort
was
practically
in
the
possession
of
the
twelfth
infantry
major
baker
who
commanded
the
fourth
infantry
says
about
we
received
orders
directing
us
to
take
our
place
in
the
line
of
battle
and
arriving
at
the
proper
point
the
regiment
was
placed
in
line
in
the
following
order
the
first
battalion
in
the
fighting
line
the
second
battalion
in
support
and
regimental
reserve
in
this
order
the
first
battalion
under
my
command
took
up
the
advance
toward
the
blockhouse
to
our
right
south
east
of
caney
this
battalion
advanced
until
it
reached
a
position
about
yards
from
the
village
where
it
remained
assisted
by
the
second
battalion
until
the
capture
of
the
fort
two
companies
of
this
first
battalion
fired
into
the
town
and
also
into
the
blockhouse
until
its
fall
a
good
part
of
the
fire
of
this
regiment
was
directed
upon
the
fort
colonel
miles
says
the
brigade
advanced
steadily
with
such
scanty
cover
as
the
ground
afforded
maintaining
a
heavy
fire
on
the
stone
fort
from
the
time
the
fight
began
until
it
ended
the
reader
is
asked
to
note
particularly
that
this
fire
was
continuous
throughout
the
fight
that
it
was
characterized
by
the
brigade
commander
as
heavy
and
that
it
was
on
the
stone
fort
he
says
as
the
brigade
advanced
across
a
plowed
field
in
front
of
the
enemy
position
the
latter
sharpshooters
in
the
houses
in
caney
enfiladed
the
left
of
our
line
with
a
murderous
fire
to
silence
it
major
baker
fourth
infantry
in
command
of
the
battalion
of
that
regiment
on
the
left
of
our
line
of
battle
directed
it
to
turn
its
fire
upon
the
town
in
so
doing
this
battalion
lost
heavily
but
its
steady
front
and
accurate
volleys
greatly
assisted
the
advance
of
the
remainder
of
the
brigade
upon
the
stone
fort
we
have
now
these
facts
clearly
brought
out
or
suggested
that
the
brigade
took
its
place
in
line
of
battle
soon
after
that
the
fourth
infantry
was
on
the
left
that
the
advance
of
the
first
battalion
of
the
fourth
infantry
was
toward
the
blockhouse
that
aside
from
the
companies
of
the
fourth
infantry
that
fired
into
town
the
remainder
of
the
brigade
advanced
upon
the
stone
fort
the
fourth
infantry
holding
the
left
of
the
line
however
reached
a
position
from
which
it
could
not
advance
its
commander
having
quickly
perceived
that
an
advance
meant
annihilation
as
it
would
involve
not
only
a
frontal
but
also
a
flank
fire
from
the
town
here
the
fourth
infantry
remained
but
continued
to
maintain
a
fire
upon
both
the
blockhouse
and
the
town
there
is
but
one
more
regiment
in
all
of
lawton
division
to
be
accounted
for
and
that
is
the
infantry
holding
the
right
of
miles
brigade
in
this
advance
this
regiment
was
in
place
in
the
line
under
its
gallant
and
experienced
commander
daggett
and
contributed
its
full
share
of
that
heavy
fire
on
the
stone
fort
from
the
time
the
fight
began
until
it
ended
major
mccaskey
says
the
first
battalion
of
his
regiment
took
a
position
on
the
left
of
the
firing
line
the
statement
seems
erroneous
and
one
is
inclined
to
believe
that
it
was
originally
written
on
the
right
instead
of
on

but
it
is
enough
for
our
purpose
now
that
the
firing
line
of
the
is
recognized
well
in
advance
major
baker
who
commanded
on
the
left
of
the
brigade
line
and
whose
advance
was
stopped
by
the
flank
fire
from
the
village
and
a
frontal
fire
from
the
fort
says
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
village
of
el
caney
was
not
charged
by
any
troops
those
of
bates
brigade
and
the
infantry
after
having
carried
the
stone
fort
on
a
hill
some
feet
higher
and
to
the
east
of
the
town
fired
into
the
village
and
the
fourth
infantry
continued
its
fire
nor
was
it
charged
by
any
of
the
troops
to
our
left
such
a
charge
would
necessarily
have
been
seen
by
us
major
baker
who
was
on
the
field
and
had
the
blockhouse
in
clear
view
declares
that
some
of
bates
brigade
and
the
infantry
carried
the
stone
fort
major
mccaskey
says
that
one
battalion
of
the
twentieth
infantry
bates
brigade
was
on
the
left
of
the
firing
line
and
that
one
company
a
took
part
in
the
latter
part
of
the
charge
by
which
the
fort
was
taken
this
battalion
may
be
referred
to
by
major
baker
when
he
says
those
of
bates
brigade
and
the
infantry
after
having
carried
etc
as
there
are
some
matters
of
dispute
concerning
the
events
which
i
am
now
going
to
relate
i
will
present
a
soldier
statement
before
i
go
to
the
official
records
the
soldier
in
writing
to
me
after
the
battle
says
i
was
of
company
g
infantry
and
i
received
orders
from
lieutenant
mccorkle
to
guide
on
fourth

which
held

fire
until
you

somebody
then

came
the
orders
tramp
tramp
crash
crash
on
we
walked
and
stopped
we
fired
into
the
underbrush
for
safety
then
in
another
moment
we
were
under
spanish
fire
balls
flew
like
bees
humming
as
they
went
soon
we
found
ourselves
up
against
a
network
of
spanish
trickery
fences
ditches
and
creeks
too
numerous
to
think
of
the
only
thing
left
was
to
go
ahead
or
die
or
else
retreat
like
cowards
we
preferred
to
go
ahead
at
this
first
fence
lieutenant
mccorkle
was
taken
to
earth
by
a
spanish
bullet
lieutenant
moss
spoke
out
ahead
let
get
at
these
spaniards
a
few
moments
more
and
he
too
was
almost
dead
with
exertion
loud
speaking
running
and
jumping
as
onward
we
swept
toward
the
spanish
stronghold
the
sun
was
exceedingly
hot
as
on
the
slope
of
a
little
mound
we
rested
for
a
few
moments
we
lay
here
about
five
minutes
looking
into
the
spanish
fort
or
blockhouse
we
measured
the
distance
by
our
eyesight
then
with
our
rifles
we
began
to
cheer
and
storm
and
in
a
moment
more
up
the
hill
like
a
bevy
of
blue
birds
did
the
fly
g
and
h
companies
were
the
first
to
reach
the
summit
and
to
make
the
spaniards
fly
into
the
city
of
el
caney
which
lay
just
behind
the
hill
when
we
reached
the
summit
others
soon
began
to
our
we
fired
down
into
the
city
until
nearly
dusk
the
brigade
made
its
advance
under
fire
almost
from
the
beginning
the
commander
says
it
was
continuously
under
fire
from
to
the
attack
was
begun
by
two
companies
in
each
regiment
on
the
firing
line
strengthened
by
supports
and
reserves
from
the
remaining
companies
until
the
brigade
had
but
two
companies
in
reserve
at
one
time
in
this
hotly
engaged
contest
the
commanding
officer
of
the
infantry
sent
me
word
that
he
needed
troops
on
his
right
i
then
sent
forward
cubans
under
command
of
captains
jose
varges
and
avelens
bravo
with
lieutenants
nicholas
franco
and
tomas
repelao
to
form
on
the
right
of
the
which
was
also
the
right
of
the
brigade
with
these
cubans
i
ordered
private
henry
downey
company
h
first
infantry
on
duty
as
interpreter
at
the
headquarters
these
men
advanced
on
the
stone
fort
with
our
line
fighting
gallantly
during
which
lieutenant
nicholas
franco
was
mortally
wounded
and
died
soon
afterwards
col
miles
report
from
the
soldier
story
as
well
as
from
the
official
report
of
the
brigade
commander
it
is
conclusive
that
the
real
objective
of
the
second
brigade
was
the
stone
fort
and
that
the
infantry
which
occupied
the
right
of
the
line
had
no
other
objective
whatever
transcriber
note
no
footnote
text
present
for
this
footnote
anchor
it
also
appears
that
bates
brigade
although
somewhere
on
the
right
was
not
so
near
but
that
the
commanding
officer
of
the
could
see
the
need
of
troops
at
his
right
and
to
meet
this
need
the
brigade
commander
sent
forward
cubans
who
advanced
on
the
stone
fort
with
our
lines
the
fire
from
this
fort
continued
severe
during
the
whole
of
the
advance
and
until
the
last
halt
made
by
the
at
the
first
fence
met
by
the
lieutenant
mccorkle
was
killed
and
to
use
the
words
of
a
soldier
as
the
regiment
swept
toward
the
spanish
stronghold
to
reach
the
slope
of
a
little
mound
for
cover
many
more
fell
behind
this
little
mound
after
resting
about
five
minutes
they
began
their
last
fire
upon
the
enemy
this
must
have
been
as
late
as
and
perhaps
considerably
later
and
the
fire
from
the
stone
fort
was
vigorous
up
until
their
last
halt
as
their
casualties
prove
the
battery
had
begun
to
fire
on
the
fort
again
at
and
continued
from
the
same
position
until
the
range
being
as
has
been
already
stated
yards
hence
the
artillery
firing
at
long
range
had
ceased
and
it
is
generally
conceded
that
this
long
range
firing
had
been
ineffective
captain
capron
says
he
moved
his
battery
at
to
yards
from
caney
and
opened
fire
on
two
blockhouses
he
does
not
say
at
what
hour
he
opened
fire
on
these
two
blockhouses
or
how
long
he
continued
to
fire
or
what
was
the
effect
of
his
fire
upon
the
two
block
houses
bisbee
who
was
acting
as
support
of
capron
battery
says
of
himself
that
he
moved
with
the
battery
at
by
the
dubroix
ducureaux
road
general
lawton
says
the
battery
was
moved
to
a
new
position
about
about
yards
from
certain
blockhouses
in
the
town
where
a
few
shots
all
taking
effect
were
fired
from
these
reports
it
would
appear
that
after
moving
to
the
second
station
the
battery
fired
upon
two
blockhouses
in
the
town
and
not
upon
the
stone
fort
general
ludlow
speaking
of
the
battle
says
in
the
present
case
the
artillery
fire
was
too
distant
to
reduce
the
blockhouses
or
destroy
the
entrenchments
so
that
the
attack
was
practically
by
infantry
alone
on
the
other
hand
general
chaffee
says
the
resistance
at
this
point
meaning
the
stone
fort
at
the
time
of
assault
had
been
greatly
affected
by
the
fire
of
capron
battery
colonel
comba
of
the
twelfth
infantry
says
the
artillery
made
the
breach
through
which
our
men
entered
the
stone
work
bonsal
says
that
captain
capron
under
the
concentrated
fire
of
his
four
guns
at
a
point
blank
range
of
a
thousand
yards
had
converted
the
fort
into
a
shapeless
ruin
when
the
infantry
charged
it
it
is
probable
that
in
this
case
as
in
most
cases
of
similar
nature
the
truth
divides
equally
between
the
apparently
opposing
views
of
general
ludlow
who
is
the
authority
for
this
statement
that
the
stone
fort
at
el
caney
was
taken
by
infantry
alone
general
lawton
says
general
ludlow
professional
accomplishments
are
well
known
and
his
assignment
to
command
a
brigade
in
my
division
i
consider
a
high
compliment
to
myself
the
fighting
was
all
done
with
small
arms
were
the
words
written
me
by
an
infantryman
soon
after
the
battle
the
question
whether
capron
fired
upon
the
stone
fort
after
taking
his
new
position
or
fired
on
two
blockhouses
entirely
distinct
from
the
fort
remains
undetermined
the
author
of
this
work
inclines
to
the
conclusion
that
the
fire
of
capron
after
moving
to
his
new
position
was
directed
for
a
brief
period
at
least
upon
the
stone
fort
inasmuch
as
we
are
now
to
trace
the
career
of
the
infantry
through
an
unfortunate
dispute
on
both
sides
of
which
are
officers
of
high
rank
and
unimpeachable
honor
it
is
important
to
note
first
to
what
extent
the
several
statements
both
unofficial
and
official
can
be
harmonized
and
made
to
corroborate
one
another
major
baker
says
those
of
bates
brigade
and
the
infantry
after
having
carried
the
stone
fort
which
he
explains
was
some
feet
higher
than
the
town
then
fired
into
the
village
the
soldier
who
acted
as
of
company
g
infantry
says
after
getting
up
on
the
hill
we
fired
into
the
city
until
near
dusk
the
experience
of
the
soldier
agrees
exactly
with
the
report
of
the
officer
the
fact
that
the
went
up
the
hill
can
not
be
questioned
and
that
up
to
their
last
halt
they
went
under
fire
no
one
will
deny
bonsal
in
speaking
of
chaffee
brigade
which
was
more
immediately
charged
with
the
reduction
of
caney
ludlow
report
says
and
it
was
nearly
five
when
his
most
advanced
regiment
the
gallant
twelfth
infantry
deployed
into
the
valley
and
charged
up
the
steep
hillside
which
was
lined
with
spanish
trenches
rising
in
irregular
tiers
and
crowned
with
a
great
stone
fort
the
stone
fort
at
this
time
however
was
as
he
says
a
shapeless
ruin
where
was
the
infantry
at
this
time
bonsal
continues
almost
at
the
same
moment
the
colored
infantry
the
leading
regiment
of
miles
brigade
which
had
been
advancing
in
the
centre
started
up
the
hill
also
general
lawton
says
that
after
moving
the
battery
to
its
new
position
yards
from
certain
blockhouses
in
the
town
capron
fired
a
few
shots
all
of
which
took
effect
and
he
adds
this
firing
terminated
the
action
as
the
spanish
garrison
were
attempting
to
escape
colonel
comba
says
there
was
a
breach
in
the
stonework
large
enough
for
his
men
to
enter
and
that
this
had
been
made
by
the
artillery
general
chaffee
says
resistance
had
been
greatly
affected
by
the
artillery
and
bonsal
adds
the
garrison
resisted
the
last
advance
made
by
the
infantry
but
for
a
moment
general
chaffee
declares
the
troops
arriving
at
the
fort
were
there
in
the
following
order
twelfth
infantry
which
took
the
place
the
command
of
general
bates
some
moments
later
the
infantry
the
facts
therefore
stand
that
the
infantry
was
on
the
ground
with
the
first
troops
that
reached
the
fort
and
that
there
was
a
captain
of
that
regiment
who
then
and
there
claimed
the
capture
of
the
place
even
against
the
claims
of
a
he
was
told
that
his
proposition
was
absurd
and
so
it
may
have
been
from
one
standpoint
and
yet
there
may
be
a
ground
upon
which
the
claim
was
fair
and
just
that
the
twelfth
infantry
arrived
on
the
ground
first
is
not
disputed
but
it
is
questioned
whether
the
fort
was
belligerent
at
that
time
general
chaffee
says
the
resistance
had
been
greatly
reduced
by
the
artillery
general
lawton
says
the
action
had
been
finished
by
capron
shots
and
the
garrison
was
trying
to
escape
a
soldier
from
the
says
the
spaniards
flew
out
of
the
fort
to
the
town
bonsal
says
they
stoutly
resisted
for
a
moment
and
then
fled
precipitately
down
the
ravine
and
up
the
other
side
and
into
the
town
if
first
occupancy
is
the
only
ground
upon
which
the
capture
of
a
place
can
be
claimed
then
the
title
to
the
honor
of
capturing
the
stone
fort
lies
according
to
official
report
as
so
far
presented
with
the
twelfth
infantry
but
even
upon
this
ground
it
will
be
shown
that
the
action
will
relieve
the
claim
of
its
captain
from
absurdity
we
are
now
prepared
to
read
the
official
report
of
the
commanding
officer
of
the
regiment
daggett
who
was
with
the
regiment
all
through
the
fight
and
who
bore
himself
so
well
that

special

sir
i
have
the
honor
to
submit
the
following
report
of
the
part
taken
by
the
infantry
in
the
battle
of
the
instant
the
regiment
formed
firing
line
on
the
right
of
the
fourth
infantry
facing
a
spanish
fort
or
blockhouse
about
half
a
mile
distant
on
moving
forward
the
battalion
composed
of
companies
c
d
e
g
and
h
and
commanded
by
capt
scott
received
the
fire
of
the
enemy
and
after
advancing
about
yards
was
subjected
to
a
galling
fire
on
their
left
finding
cover
the
battalion
prepared
for
an
advance
up
the
hill
to
the
fort
this
advance
was
made
rapidly
and
conducted
with
great
skill
by
company
officers
on
arriving
within
a
short
distance
of
the
fort
the
white
flag
was
waved
to
our
companies
but
a
cross
fire
prevented
the
enemy
from
advancing
with
it
or
our
officers
from
receiving
it
about
twenty
minutes
later
a
battalion
of
some
other
regiment
advanced
to
the
rear
of
the
fort
completely
covered
from
fire
and
received
the
flag
but
the
men
of
the
infantry
entered
the
fort
at
the
same
time
all
officers
and
men
behaved
gallantly
one
officer
was
killed
and
three
wounded
eight
men
were
killed
and
twenty
wounded
about
men
and
ten
officers
were
in
the
firing
line
i
attribute
the
comparatively
small
losses
to
the
skill
and
bravery
of
the

viz
first
lieutenant
caldwell
and
second
lieutenants
moss
and
hunt
second
lieutenant
french
adjutant
of
the
battalion
was
among
those
who
gallantly
entered

the
battle
lasted
about
two
hours
and
was
a
hotly
contested
combat
very
respectfully
daggett
infantry
commanding
here
it
is
shown
by
the
testimony
of
the
regimental
commander
that
a
battalion
of
the
ascended
the
hill
and
arrived
at
a
short
distance
from
the
fort
about
twenty
minutes
before
any
other
troops
are
mentioned
as
coming
in
sight
and
that
a
white
flag
was
waved
to
the
companies
of
the
it
was
doubtless
upon
this
ground
that
a
captain
of
the
had
the
temerity
to
claim
the
capture
of
the
place
even
from
a
i
do
not
know
who
the
captain
was
but
it
is
evident
that
he
had
what
he
believed
ample
grounds
for
his
claim
colonel
daggett
says
also
that
when
the
men
of
the
other
regiment
advanced
to
this
fort
after
it
had
waved
the

to

almost

that

company
c
lieutenant
murdock
which
was
in
support
to
the
front
and
company
lieutenant
kinnison
from
regimental
reserve
to
take
its
place
thus
strengthened
the
four
companies
moved
up
the
hill
rapidly
being
skilfully
handled
by
company
officers
on
arriving
near
the
fort
the
white
flag
was
waved
toward
our
men
but
the
fire
from
the
village
on
our
left
was
so
severe
that
neither
our
officers
nor
spanish
could
pass
over
the
intervening
ground
after
about
twenty
minutes
some
of
the
twelfth
infantry
arrived
in
rear
of
the
fort
completely
sheltered
from
the
fire
from
the
village
and
received
the
white
flag
but
privates
jones
of
company
d
and
butler
company
infantry
entered
the
fort
at
the
same
time
and
took
possession
of
the
spanish
flag
they
were
ordered
to
give
it
up
by
an
officer
of
the
twelfth
united
states
infantry
but
before
doing
so
they
each
tore
a
piece
from
it
which
they
now
have
so
much
for
the
facts
i
attribute
the
success
attained
by
our
line
largely
to
the
bravery
and
skill
of
the
company
officers
who
conducted
the
line
to
the
fort
these
officers
are
first
lieutenants
caldwell
and
moss
and
second
lieutenant
hunt
it
is
my
opinion
that
the
two
companies
first
deployed
could
not
have
reached
the
fort
alone
and
that
it
was
the
two
companies
i
ordered
to
their
support
that
gave
them
the
power
to
reach
it
i
further
believe
that
had
we
failed
to
move
beyond
the
fourth
infantry
the
fort
would
not
have
been
taken
that
night
the
infantry
lost
one
officer
killed
and
three
wounded
and
seven
men
killed
and
wounded
second
lieutenant
french
adjutant
of
captain
battalion
arrived
at
the
fort
near
the
same
time
as
the
other
officers
i
request
that
this
report
be
forwarded
to
corps
headquarters
very
respectfully
daggett
infantry
commanding
general
chaffee
statement
is
not
to
be
questioned
for
a
moment
there
is
not
the
least
doubt
that
the
troops
as
organizations
arrived
at
the
fort
in
the
order
he
describes
general
lawton
says
general
chaffee
brigade
was
especially
charged
with
the
duty
of
assaulting
the
stone
fort
and
successfully
executed
that
duty
after
which
a
portion
of
the
and
a
portion
of
bates
brigade
assisted
in
the
work
all
of
which
is
commendable
he
says
also
that
the
infantry
did
excellent
service
as
reported
though
not
better
than
the
others
engaged
this
seems
to
confirm
daggett
report
for
he
says
he
is
sure
the
regiment
did
excellent
work
as
reported
and
at
that
time
he
is
commenting
on
daggett
report
the
report
printed
above
the
broad
statements
of
general
lawton
do
not
touch
the
exact
question
at
issue
between
the
reports
of
the
subordinate
commanders
nor
do
they
throw
any
light
on
the
circumstances
of
the
final
charge
miles
brigade
had
been
advancing
on
the
stone
fort
for
some
hours
and
the
was
so
near
when
the
charge
of
the
twelfth
was
made
that
portions
of
it
were
on
the
hill
and
near
the
fort
at
the
same
time
the
commander
of
the
third
brigade
saw
the
fight
from
one
side
and
reported
events
as
he
learned
them
his
official
statement
requires
no
support
the
commanding
officer
of
the
infantry
saw
the
fight
from
another
standpoint
and
his
official
reports
are
entitled
to
equal
respect
both
the
general
and
the
must
be
accepted
as
recitals
of
facts
made
with
all
the
accuracy
that
high
personal
integrity
armed
with
thorough
military
training
can
command
happily
the
statements
which
at
first
appear
so
widely
at
variance
are
entirely
reconcilable
the
following
supplementary
report
of
the
regimental
commander
when
taken
in
connection
with
the
final
complimentary
orders
published
in
the
regiment
before
leaving
cuba
will
place
the
whole
subject
before
the
reader
and
put
the
question
at
rest
and
at
the
same
time
leave
undisturbed
all
the
reports
of
superior
officers
headquarters
infantry
montauk
point
long
island
august
the
army
washington
sir
i
have
the
honor
to
submit
a
supplementary
report
to
the
original
one
made
on
the
of
july
of
the
battle
of
el
caney
de
cuba
so
far
as
relates
to
the
part
taken
therein
by
the
infantry
i
stated
in
the
original
report
that
the
infantry
in
advancing
broke
away
from
and
left
the
fourth
infantry
behind
this
may
inferentially
reflect
on
the
latter
regiment
it
was
not
so
intended
and
a
subsequent
visit
to
the
convinces
me
that
it
would
have
been
impossible
for
the
regiment
to
advance
to
the
fort
and
although
it
might
have
advanced
a
short
distance
farther
it
would
have
resulted
in
a
useless
slaughter
and
that
the
battalion
commander
exercised
excellent
judgment
in
remaining
where
he
did
and
by
his
fire
aiding
the
infantry
in
its
advance
colonel
miles
the
then
brigade
commander
informed
me
that
his
first
report
of
the
battle
would
be
brief
and
that
a
later
and
full
report
would
be
made
in
his
former
report
i
think
he
failed
to
give
credit
to
myself
and
regiment
as
he
was
soon
after
relieved
of
the
command
of
the
brigade
i
assume
that
no
further
report
will
be
made
i
have
reported
what
the
regiment
did
but
said
nothing
about
my
own
action
i
must
therefore
report
it
myself
or
let
it
go
unrecorded
distasteful
as
it
is
to
me
i
deem
it
duty
to
my
children
to
state
the
facts
and
my
claims
based
thereon
as
follows
i
was
ordered
to
put
two
companies
in
the
firing
line
before
this
line
advanced
the
brigade
commander
informed
me
and
personal
examination
verified
that
my
right
was
in
the
air
and
exposed
on
my
own
judgment
i
ordered
a
company
as
flankers
to
that
part
of
the
line
as
soon
as
the
line
had
rested
and
become
steadied
at
its
first
halt
i
ordered
it
to
advance
and
it
continued
to
advance
although
it
broke
away
from
the
rest
of
the
brigade
as
this
exposed
the
left
to
a
galling
and
dangerous
fire
i
ordered
on
my
own
judgment
a
company
to
that
part
of
the
line
and
a
company
from
the
regimental
reserve
also
to
the
fighting
line
these
are
the
facts
and
as
my
orders
were
to
keep
my
left
joined
to
the
right
of
the
fourth
infantry
and
received
no
further
orders
my
claims
are
as
follows
that
it
was
necessary
to
place
a
company
on
the
right
as
flankers
that
the
conditions
offered
an
opportunity
to
advance
after
the
first
halt
and
i
took
advantage
of
it
that
the
left
being
exposed
by
this
advance
of
the
line
beyond
the
rest
of
the
brigade
it
was
proper
and
necessary
to
it
by
two
companies
that
the
two
companies
first
deployed
could
not
have
reached
the
stone
fort
that
the
three
companies
added
to
the
firing
line
gave
it
the
power
to
reach
the
fort
that
the
advance
beyond
the
rest
of
the
brigade
was
a
bold
and
without
support
dangerous
movement
but
that
the
result
justified
the
act
had
it
failed
i
would
have
been
held
responsible
that
i
saw
at
each
stage
of
the
battle
what
ought
to
be
done
and
did
it
results
show
that
it
was
done
at
the
right
moment
that
the
infantry
caused
the
surrender
of
the
stone
fort
i
desire
to
repeat
that
it
is
with
great
reluctance
that
i
make
so
much
of
this
report
as
relates
to
myself
and
nothing
but
a
sense
of
duty
would
impel
me
to
do
it

the
prospect
of
its

gathered
from
three
different
stations
many
of
you
strangers
to
each
other
you
assembled
as
a
regiment
for
the
first
time
in
more
than
years
on
may
at
tampa
florida
there
you
endeavored
to
solidify
and
prepare
yourselves
as
far
as
the
oppressive
weather
would
permit
for
the
work
that
appeared
to
be
before
you
but
who
could
have
fortold
the
severity
of
that
work
you
endured
the
severe
hardships
of
a
long
sea
voyage
which
no
one
who
has
not
experienced
it
can
appreciate
you
then
disembarked
amidst
dangerous
surroundings
and
on
landing
were
for
the
first
time
on
hostile
ground
you
marched
under
a
tropical
sun
carrying
three
rations
and
one
hundred
rounds
of
ammunition
through
rain
and
mud
part
of
the
time
at

sleeping
on
the
wet
ground
without
shelter
living
part
of
the
time
on
scant
rations
even
of
bacon
hard
bread
and
coffee
until
on
july
you
arrived
at
el
caney
here
you
took
the
battle
formation
and
advanced
to
the
stone
fort
more
like
veterans
than
troops
who
had
never
been
under
fire
you
again
marched
day
and
night
halting
only
to
dig
four
lines
of
intrenchments
the
last
being
the
nearest
point
to
the
enemy
reached
by
any
organization
when
still
holding
your
rifles
within
these
intrenchments
notice
was
received
that
santiago
and
the
spanish
army
had
surrendered
but
commendable
as
the
record
cited
may
be
the
brightest
hours
of
your
lives
were
on
the
afternoon
of
july
formed
in
battle
array
you
advanced
to
the
stone
fort
against
volleys
therefrom
and
in
front
and
against
a
galling
fire
from
blockhouses
the
church
tower
and
the
village
on
your
left
you
continued
to
advance
skilfully
and
bravely
directed
by
the
officers
in
immediate
command
halting
and
delivering
such
a
cool
and
fire
that
the
enemy
was
compelled
to
wave
the
white
flag
in
token
of
surrender
seldom
have
troops
been
called
upon
to
face
a
severer
fire
and
never
have
they
acquitted
themselves
better
the
regimental
reserve
was
called
upon
to
try
its
nerve
by
lying
quiet
under
a
galling
fire
without
the
privilege
of
returning
it
where
men
were
killed
and
wounded
this
is
a
test
of
nerve
which
the
firing
line
can
not
realize
and
requires
the
highest
qualities
of
bravery
and
endurance
you
may
well
return
to
the
united
states
proud
of
your
accomplishments
and
if
any
one
asks
you
what
you
have
done
point
him
to
el
caney
but
in
the
midst
of
the
joy
of
going
home
we
mourn
the
loss
of
those
we
leave
behind
the
genial
mccorkle
fell
at
his
post
of
duty
bravely
directing
his
men
in
the
advance
on
the
stone
fort
he
died
as
the
soldier
dies
and
received
a

burial
he
was
beloved
by
all
who
knew
him
and
his
name
will
always
be
fondly
remembered
by
his
regiment
especially
by
those
who
participated
in
the
santiago
campaign

i
would
respectfully
recommend
to
your
excellency

formerly
maine
volunteers
as
an
officer
highly
qualified
to
command
a
regiment
major
daggett
served
his
full
term
in
this
brigade
with
honor
both
to
himself
and
state
and
won
for
himself
the
reputation
of
being
a
brave
reliable
and
efficient
officer
his
promotion
to
a
colonelcy
would
be
a
great
benefit
to
the
service
while
the
honor
of

scarcely
be

fine
tactician
and
of
being
thoroughly
versed
in
military
law
as
is
indicated
by
major
hancock
commendatory
words
in
i
look
upon
him
as
by
far
the
best
tactician
in
the
regiment
and
as
for
a
thorough
clear
knowledge
of
tactics
his
superior
is
not
in

as
regards

law
i
know

informed
his

this

to

it
is

to
add
but
a
word
personal
colonel
daggett
is
a
typical
new
englander
tall
nervous
and
sinewy
a
centre
of
energy
making
himself
felt
wherever
he
may
be
precise
and
forceful
of

correct

sincere
in
manners
a
safe
counsellor
and
a
loyal

his
character
approaches
the
ideal
stern
and
commanding
as
an
officer
he
is
nevertheless
tender
and
sympathetic
his
very
sensitiveness
concerning
the
feelings
of
others
embarrasses
him
in
giving
expression
to
his
own
feelings
on
seeing
suffering
unless
it
should
be
urgent
but
those
who
know
him
best
know
him
to
be
just
humane
and
tender
no
man
could
have
taken
more
care
than
he
did
for
his
regiment
in

vehemency
suited

he
nevertheless
deplores

the
president

never
did
a
more
worthy
act
than
when
he
gave
to

make

and
at

the

were

during

in

i
have
the
honor
to
officially
state
that
about
noon
july
the
regiment
moved
from
the
mango
grove
near
the
ducro
house
toward
a
stone
fort
located
on
a
hill
near
the
town
of
el

it
arrived
at
about
one
of
the
afternoon
at
a
point
about
eight
hundred
yards
to
the
south
and
east
of
the
fort
immediately
deployed

the

battalion
under
command
of
captain
walter

and
of
which
i
was
adjutant
designated
as
the
attacking
line
presently
after
advancing
a
few
yards
we
were
subjected
to
a
galling
fire
from
the
stone
fort
the
trenches
in
its
front
and
from
a
blockhouse
on
its
right
the
line
steadily
moved
forward
directing
its
fire
at
the
stone
fort
and
the
trenches
surrounding
it
when
within
about
one
hundred
and
fifty
yards
from
the
fort
the
line
was
halted
and
several
sharpshooters
directed
by
their
company
officers
to
fire
at
the
loopholes
finally
when
the
men
had
regained
their
wind
a
rush
was
made
part
of
the
line
going
through
a
cornfield
at
the
foot
the
line
was
again
halted
and
after
a
few
moments
rest
charged
up
the
hill
and
the
fort
surrendered
i
went
to
the
fort
and
found
a
spanish
lieutenant
and
seven
enlisted
men
whom
i
passed
out
and
were
taken
charge
of
by
an
officer
of
the
infantry
this
was
about
since
the
above
was

with
great
distinction
in

in

reached

it
was

had

with

three
days
in

had
never

since
its
organization

it
necessarily
followed
that
many
of
the
officers
as
well
as
men
were
strangers
to
each

our
camp
at
tampa
was
fair
the
ground

and
flat
but
as
the
rainy
season
had
not
set
in
it
was
dry
and
the
health
was
good

and
parades
were
held
daily
sundays
excepted
but
on
account
of
the
intense
heat
the
hours
for
it
were
limited
to
the
early
mornings
and
after
sunset
the
clothing
of
the
men
was
the
same
they
had
worn
in
montana
and
did
not
add
to
their
comfort
supplies
of
all
kinds
except
rations
came
by
piecemeal
and
we
finally
sailed
for
the
tropics
with
the
same
clothing
used
in
the
northwest
at
june
the
regiment
received
orders
to
strike
tents
and
be
ready
to
move
within
an
hour
the
order
was
immediately
complied
with
though
the
necessary
transportation
to
move
the
baggage
did
not
report
until
the
forenoon
of
the
following
day
it
was
not
far
from
noon
when
the
last
of
it
left
the
camp
for
the
railroad
station
en
route
to
port
tampa
where
we
were
to
embark
on
transports
for
the
seat
of
war
as
soon
as
the
camp
equipage
was
started
the
regiment
was
formed
and
marched
to
west
tampa
about
three
miles
where
we
took
a
train
for
port
tampa
distant
nine
miles
on
arrival
the
regiment
boarded
the
steamer
concho
one
of
the
vessels
to
carry
the
expedition
to
its
destination
the
infantry
had
preceded
us
and
the
next
day
a
battalion
of
the
massachusetts
volunteers
was
put
on
but
owing
to
the
crowded
condition
of
the
ship
a
few
days
later
they
were
transferred
to
another
vessel
the
concho
is
a
large
ship
but
without
the
comforts
i
have
seen
since
then
on
the
army
transports
plying
between
san
francisco
and
manila
the
ships
used
were
hastily
fitted
up
for
the
occasion
and
it
could
not
be
expected
that
they
would
be
all
that
was
required
but
some
of
the
appointments
could
and
should
have
been
better
after
a
tedious
wait
until
june
we
sailed
down
tampa
bay
and
out
on
the
gulf
of
mexico
still
in
ignorance
of
our
destination
the
evening
of
the
the
light
at
dry
tortugas
was
seen
to
our
right
june
and
our
course
was
a
little
south
of
east
and
part
of
the
time
the
north
coast
of
cuba
was
visible
the
weather
except
the
intense
heat
was
fine
on
sunday
morning
june
we
entered
the
windward
passage
and
it
seemed
certain
from
our
course
that
santiago
was
our
objective
early
the
next
morning
the
high
mountains
of
santiago
de
cuba
were
in
plain
sight
to
our
north
june
and
remained
off
the
coast
the
sea
was
rough
and
the
vessel
rolled
considerably
adding
to
the
discomfort
of
every
one
especially
those
subject
to
seasickness
during
the
evening
of
the
orders
were
received
to
be
ready
to
disembark
the
following
morning
about
on
the
our
warships
began
shelling
the
coast
and
two
hours
later
the
troops
started
in
small
boats
from
the
transports
to
the
shore
by
evening
most
of
the
second
division
and
part
of
the
cavalry
division
were
on
cuban
soil
there
was
no
opposition
to
our
landing
i
believe
that
a
small
force
well
handled
could
have
made
it
very
difficult
if
indeed
it
could
not
have
prevented
it
as
soon
as
the
regiment
had
landed
it
was
marched
out
about
four
miles
and
bivouacked
for
the
night
the
country
is
rugged
and
covered
with
a
dense
tropical
vegetation
a
few
cuban
patriots
had
joined
us
and
formed
the
extreme
advance
saving
us
some
disagreeable
outpost
duty
this
was
the
only
service
that
i
know
of
them
doing
throughout
the
campaign
though
they
were
always
on
hand
ration
day
later
developments
showed
that
the
service
rendered
was
not
so
important
as
any
spanish
force
had
retired
to
a
safe
place
something
our
friends
looked
out
for
whenever
there
was
any
danger
june
the
regiment
started
shortly
after
daylight
towards
the
city
of
santiago
about
there
was
a
report
that
the
enemy
were
in
our
front
the
regiment
was
immediately
formed
for
battle
and
reconnoitering
parties
sent
forward
after
about
thirty
minutes
delay
the
supposed
enemy
proved
to
be
the
large
leaves
of
some
tropical
trees
being
moved
by
the
wind
giving
them
the
appearance
of
persons
in
motion
our
route
was
over
a
narrow
trail
through
a
dense
wilderness
water
was
scarce
and
the
heat
was
intense
about
noon
we
arrived
at
siboney
where
we
bivouacked
for
the
night
before
daylight
next
morning
the
troops
in
our
rear
were
heard
passing
on
the
trail
by
our
camp
shortly
after
daylight
captain
capron
battery
of
four
guns
passed
and
the
men
lined
up
along
the
road
and
cheered
lustily
about
an
hour
later
musketry
fire
and
the
occasional
discharge
of
a
hotchkiss
gun
could
be
plainly
heard
towards
santiago
about
of
an
hour
later
we
received
orders
to
march
by
mistake
the
wrong
trail
was
taken
and
after
marching
fourteen
hours
we
returned
to
our
camp
of
the
previous
night
all
fagged
out
a
great
many
men
of
the
brigade
were
overcome
with
heat
during
this
long
tiresome
and
fruitless
ramble
i
can
not
say
how
many
of
these
were
of
the
infantry
but
in
my
own
company
b
there
was
not
a
man
out
of
the
ranks
when
the
camp
was
reached
i
have
called
the
place
siboney
there
is
probably
some
other
name
for
it
as
the
cubans
have
one
for
every
hamlet
it
is
not
far
from
siboney
and
not
knowing
the
name
have
called
it
siboney
on
the
morning
of
the
we
got
rations
from
the
transport
and
all
enjoyed
a
hearty
breakfast
at
we
broke
camp
and
marched
to
sevilla
about
six
miles
here
we
remained
until
the
morning
of
the
part
of
the
regiment
being
out
on
picket
duty
june
the
regiment
marched
three
miles
towards
santiago
and
bivouacked
on
the
banks
of
a
small
creek
bathing
was
forbidden
as
the
creek
was
the
only
water
supply
for
the
army
the
troops
remained
at
this
place
until
the
afternoon
of
june
the
camp
was
in
the
valley
of
the
creek
the
ground
is
low
and
flat
and
with
the
heavy
rainfall
every
one
was
uncomfortable
rations
had
to
be
brought
from
siboney
over
a
trail
and
did
not
arrive
regularly
about
in
the
afternoon
on
the
the
officers
of
the
regiment
were
assembled
at
headquarters
and
were
notified
that
there
would
be
an
attack
on
the
spanish
position
the
next
morning
about
the
regiment
started
for
its
position
arriving
after
having
covered
a
distance
of
less
than
three
miles
the
route
was
over
an
excuse
for
a
road
but
was
crowded
with
some
of
the
troops
of
almost
every
organization
of
the
army
causing
numberless
halts
but
worse
than
all
breaking
the
rest
of
the
troops
on
one
part
of
this
route
i
heard
men
asking
what
regiment
is
this
and
heard
various
responses
as
follows
the
the
cavalry
the
infantry
the
cavalry
etc
some
one
asked
what
are
the
and
some
one
replied
wood
weary
walkers
i
do
not
know
who
is
responsible
for
that
condition
of
affairs
had
we
had
an
enterprising
enemy
in
our
front
disaster
certainly
would
have
followed
here
were
a
number
of
organizations
scattered
along
a
narrow
muddy
trail
at
the
mercy
of
an
active
foe
all
this
was
only
three
or
four
miles
from
the
spanish
works
the
men
were
cheerful
and
few
if
any
realized
that
there
might
be
danger
most
of
the
men
were
up
and
moving
about
before
daylight
the
next
morning
shortly
after
the
regiment
started
in
the
direction
of
el
caney
at
we
halted
in
a
mango
grove
near
the
ducureau
mansion
shortly
before
noon
a
mounted
orderly
appeared
with
a
message
for
the
brigade
commander
a
few
minutes
later
the
march
towards
el
caney
was
taken
up
heavy
musketry
fire
had
been
heard
in
that
direction
since
shortly
before
a
march
of
little
more
than
a
mile
and
the
regiment
was
formed
for
battle
companies

and
h
in
the
firing
line
c
and
d
in
support
the
remaining
four
companies
in
reserve
for
two
hours
or
perhaps
more
the
firing
was
very
heavy
especially
during
the
second
hour
attention
is
called
to
report
of
colonel
daggett
pages
and
report
of
the

and
endorsement
on
same
by
chaffee
he
says
this
stone
fort
was
practically
in
the
possession
of
the
infantry
at
about
july
i
can
not
reconcile
this
statement
with
the
fact
that
between
the
hours
named
some
of
the
heaviest
firing
was
going
on
which
does
not
indicate
that
its
defenders
were
ready
to
give
up
lord
wellington
once
said
at
the
end
of
every
campaign
truth
lies
at
the
bottom
of
a
deep
well
and
it
often
takes
twenty
years
to
get
her
out
this
may
not
be
an
exception
about
the
firing
ceased
and
el
caney
was
ours
the
dead
were
collected
near
a
hedge
and
the
regiment
was
formed
in
column
of
masses
to
pay
a
silent
tribute
of
respect
to
our
departed
comrades
the
regiment
then
started
for
the
mango
grove
where
we
had
left
our
blanket
rolls
and
haversacks
just
as
we
were
starting
some
men
with
canteens
started
for
water
about
a
mile
away
when
orders
were
received
to
be
ready
to
march
in
twenty
minutes
a
few
rods
took
us
back
to
the
road
leading
to
santiago
we
moved
down
the
road
about
of
a
mile
and
halted
two
hours
later
the
pack
train
arrived
with
ammunition
and
then
another
with
rations
before
the
latter
were
issued
orders
were
issued
to
move
at
once
to
the
rear
the
regiment
marched
over
the
trail
it
had
come
on
the
day
before
arriving
at
el
poso
about
here
we
took
the
road
leading
to
santiago
about
we
passed
under
san
juan
hill
and
moved
to
our
right
our
forces
held
the
crest
of
the
hill
in
passing
along
the
hill
we
were
sheltered
from
the
fire
except
a
short
space
where
one
or
two
men
were
slightly
wounded
arriving
at
the
la
cruz
house
near
the
road
leading
from
el
caney
to
santiago
about
and
bivouacked
for
the
night
about
the
troops
on
our
left
were
attacked
by
the
spanish
the
firing
was
very
heavy
for
an
hour
when
it
suddenly
ceased
and
we
retired
for
the
night
during
this
time
we
were
under
the
hill
and
protected
from
the
fire
next
morning
sunday
july
desultory
firing
began
at
daylight
about
the
regiment
left
the
la
cruz
house
and
moved
across
the
road
and
formed
line
to
the
left
and
moved
forward
to
a
ridge
overlooking
the
city
a
number
of
shots
fell
about
us
but
no
one
was
struck
shortly
after
we
were
in
possession
of
the
ridge
and
began
intrenching
the
firing
was
kept
up
and
two
men
were
wounded
about
noon
we
were
informed
that
a
truce
had
been
established
and
all
work
was
stopped
this
gave
all
a
rest
though
it
proved
to
be
of
short
duration
caused
by
a
false
alarm
by
major
webb
the
inspector
of
the
division
staff
during
the
afternoon
the
regiment
was
moved
to
the
foot
of
the
ridge
leaving
only
the
pickets
on
the
crest
about
we
were
ordered
to
the
picket
line
and
began
intrenching
the
tall
grass
was
wet
from
a
drenching
rain
a
few
hours
before
the
ground
though
wet
was
hard
and
slow
progress
was
made
having
only
their
bayonets
for
picks
and
their
bare
hands
for
shovels
all
night
this
work
went
on
the
men
were
tired
and
hungry
as
rations
had
not
come
up
that
day
but
worked
faithfully
during
this
and
i
will
add
throughout
the
campaign
i
never
heard
a
murmur
nor
a
complaint
even
when
almost
all
the
men
of
the
regiment
were
down
with
fever
and
bowel
trouble
they
were
cheerful
and
ready
to
do
any
duty
they
were
called
on
for
the
morning
of
july
cervera
fleet
sailed
down
the
bay
an
officer
rode
by
our
part
of
the
line
about
and
informed
us
of
it
a
few
minutes
later
we
heard
the
roar
of
the
big
guns
though
at
the
time
i
little
thought
of
what
was
going
on
in
the
afternoon
we
heard
cheering
on
our
line
way
to
the
left
and
as
the
good
news
came
along
it
was
taken
up
and
soon
the
whole
line
was
shouting
on
the
morning
of
july
the
left
santiago
by
two
roads
one
passing
through
our
line
it
was
a
pitiful
sight
during
the
forenoon
of
the
we
moved
about
a
mile
to
the
right
and
began
intrenching
this
position
was
very
near
the
spanish
line
and
quite
elaborate
works
were
constructed
we
remained
in
this
position
until
the
morning
of
the
when
the
regiment
was
ordered
to
the
right
of
the
line
about
three
miles
here
we
intrenched
about
a
truce
was
announced
at
a
staff
officer
came
to
the
regimental
commander
tent
and
informed
him
that
the
regiment
was
to
be
on
the
line
at
midnight
and
as
soon
as
the
moon
rose
to
advance
through
the
jungle
until
fired
on
when
the
line
was
to
halt
and
intrench
the
night
was
stormy
and
any
moon
there
might
have
been
was
obscured
by
the
clouds
we
were
up
however
standing
until
daylight
in
a
drenching
rain
for
it
was
so
dark
that
any
movement
was
impossible
our
rest
was
broken
without
accomplishing
anything
that
i
know
or
heard
of
however
the
rain
and
storm
were
providential
for
i
will
always
believe
if
the
movement
had
been
started
we
should
have
met
with
disaster
the
ground
was
broken
deep
ravines
and
underbrush
with
wire
fences
running
through
it
i
have
never
learned
who
was
the
father
of
this
order
and
possibly
never
will
he
must
be
ashamed
of
it
the
afternoon
of
the
the
regiment
advanced
several
hundred
yards
to
the
front
and
dug
more
intrenchments
they
were
still
on
this
work
the
afternoon
of
the
when
it
was
announced
that
the
spanish
army
had
agreed
to
surrender
this
came
none
too
soon
for
our
men
were
coming
down
with
malarial
fever
a
few
days
later
nearly
half
the
regiment
were
on
the
sick
list
and
the
balance
could
not
have
done
much
the
regiment
was
moved
the
same
afternoon
to
higher
ground
in
rear
of
the
trenches
strong
guards
were
kept
to
look
out
for
our
prisoners
and
to
prevent
our
allies
the
cubans
from
going
into
the
city
on
the
morning
of
the
the
formal
surrender
of
the
city
and
spanish
army
took
place
we
were
some
distance
away
and
did
not
see
anything
of
the
ceremony
on
july
the
regiment
was
moved
about
a
mile
further
back
in
the
hills
and
made
camp
our
tents
having
been
brought
up
from
the
transport
medicines
appeared
very
scarce
resulting
in
much
suffering
the
food
supplied
was
totally
unfit
for
our
new
surroundings
and
i
believe
not
a
little
of
the
sickness
can
be
traced
to
this
our
last
camp
was
as
good
as
any
to
be
found
in
that
vicinity
the
regiment
remained
in
camp
until
august
when
it
embarked

and
had
fired
a
few
shots
at
a
blockhouse
on
san
juan
hill
distance
yards
using
black
powder
which
created
a
cloud
of
smoke
with
every
shot
the
battery
was
readily
located
by
the
foe
and
the
shrapnel
from
their
guns
was
soon
bursting
among
our
forces
the
second
shot
from
the
spaniards
wounded
four
of
the
rough

and
two
or
three
of

as
a
matter
of

there
was
a
rapid
movements
of
the
troops
from
that
immediate
vicinity
the
firing
soon
ceased
and
the
troops
took
up
that
general
advance
movement
already
noted
it
is
no
easy
task
to
follow
the
movements
of
the
cavalry
division
from
the
time
it
left
el
poso
that
july
morning
until
it
finally
entrenched
itself
for
the
night
on
san
juan
hills
as
heretofore
we
will
take
the
official
reports
first
and
from
them
make
up
the
itinerary
and
the
movements
of
the
battle
that
followed
as
far
as
they
will
enable
us
to
do
so
general
sumner
says
the
division
proceeded
toward
santiago
and
when
about
of
a
mile
from
el
poso
was
halted
in
a
narrow
road
to
await
orders
and
remained
there
for
nearly
an
hour
subject
to
the
effects
of
heavy
artillery
fire
from
the
enemy
battery
major
wessells
of
the
third
cavalry
says
while
following
the
road
toward
santiago
that
morn
much
delay
ensued
from
some
reason
unknown
to
the
undersigned
and
that
the
first
brigade
of
the
division
arrived
at
san
juan
ford
about
this
creek
was
about
five
hundred
yards
farther
toward
santiago
than
aguadores
river
and
ran
about
parallel
with
san
juan
heights
from
which
it
was
about
of
a
mile
distant
the
orders
for
which
general
sumner
had
waited
nearly
an
hour
under
fire
had
come
and
were
verbal
instructions
to
move
to
the
san
juan
creek
and
hold
it
reaching
this
creek
his
advance
guard
was
met
by
the
spaniards
who
fired
one
volley
and
retreated
to
a
position
on
a
hill
on
sumner
right
front
about
yards
distant
crossing
this
creek
with
sufficient
strength
to
hold
it
sumner
was
now
ordered
to
move
by
the
right
flank
and
connect
with
lawton
left
while
his
troops
were
in
this
massed
condition
prior
to
deploying
to
the
right
through
a
thick
jungle
the
balloon
that
was
in
use
for
purposes
of
reconnoitering
came
up
the
road
and
exposed
itself
to
the
full
view
of
the
spaniards
upon
the
heights
they
needed
no
further
invitation
to
direct
toward
our
forces
their
artillery
for
which
the
balloon
became
a
flying
target
many
officers
and
men
were
wounded
here
by
exploding
shells
and
small
arms
fire
of
the
enemy
sumner
under
this
fire
however
the
troops
were
deployed
as
ordered
colonel
wood
who
had
charge
of
the
second
brigade
of
which
the
rough
riders
were
the
leading
regiment
says
this
regiment
was
directed
to
change
direction
to
the
right
and
by
moving
up
the
creek
to
effect
a
junction
with
general
lawton
division
which
was
engaged
at
caney
about
one
and
miles
toward
the
right
but
was
supposed
to
be
working
toward
our
right
flank
after
proceeding
in
this
direction
about
half
a
mile
the
effort
to
connect
with
general
lawton
was
given
up
this
movement
to
the
right
took
place
between
ten
and
eleven
at
which
time
lawton
forces
had
made
no
impression
upon
el
caney
and
he
was
far
from
making
any
movement
which
might
be
described
as
working
toward
the
right
flank
of
the
cavalry
division
lawton
was
not
found
by
that
search
to
the
right
and
it
was
evident
that
something
must
be
done
by
these
troops
in
front
and
done
quickly
the
whole
division
was
under
fire
and
the
battle
on
the
spanish
side
was
in
actual
progress
true
our
men
were
hidden
away
in
the
jungle
that
bordered
the
creek
but
their
position
was
known
to
the
spaniards
and
leaves
and
boughs
are
no
cover
from
shot
and
shell
they
were
receiving
the
fire
of
the
enemy
and
making
no
reply
whatever
save
by
the
few
ineffective
shots
from
the
far
away
battery
on
el
poso
hill
directly
in
front
of
the
cavalry
division
was
a
little
hill
occupied
by
a
spanish
force
this
hill
is
called
in
general
wood
report
east
hill
but
in
the
literature
of
the
battle
it
is
usually
mentioned
as
kettle
hill
the
fire
in
part
was
coming
from
here
colonel
wood
gives
another
report
of
the
morning
experience
in
which
he
says
the
brigade
moved
down
the
road
toward
santiago
in
rear
of
the
first
brigade
with
instructions
to
deploy
to
the
right
after
crossing
the
san
juan
and
continue
to
extend
to
the
right
reaching
out
toward
general
lawton
left
and
holding
ourselves
in
rear
of
the
first
brigade
as
a
support
on
reaching
the
stream
the
first
volunteer
cavalry
which
was
in
the
lead
crossed
the
stream
with
comparatively
slight
loss
and
deployed
to
the
right
in
good
order
but
at
this
time
a
captive
balloon
was
led
down
the
road
in
which
the
troops
were
massed
and
finally
anchored
at
the
crossing
of
the
stream
the
approach
and
anchoring
of
this
balloon
served
to
indicate
the
line
of
approach
of
the
troops
and
to
locate
the
ford
and
the
result
was
a
terrific
converging
of
artillery
and
rifle
fire
on
the
ford
which
resulted
in
severe
loss
of
men
under
this
fire
the
first
united
states
cavalry
and
the
tenth
united
states
cavalry
crossed
the
stream
and
deployed
to
the
right
where
they
were
placed
in
position
in
rear
of
the
first
brigade
two
regiments
of
the
second
brigade
to
the
first
and
the
tenth
regular
cavalry
were
located
in
the
rear
of
the
first
brigade
the
first
regular
cavalry
had
begun
its
day
work
as
support
of
grimes
battery
but
had
later
come
forward
and
taken
its
place
in
the
brigade
time
enough
to
join
in
the
action
that
followed
after
completing
the
deployment
says
sumner
the
command
was
so
much
committed
to
battle
that
it
became
necessary
either
to
advance
or
else
retreat
under
fire
the
troops
were
already
in
battle
but
were
not
fighting
and
could
not
do
so
in
their
present
position
simply
because
they
could
not
see
the
enemy
lieutenant
miley
representing
general
shafter
authorized
an
advance
which
was
ordered
brigade
taking
the
advance
reinforced
on
the
right
by
regiment
and
supported
by
the
first
and
tenth
cavalry
sumner
colonel
wood
says
after
remaining
in
this
position
for
about
an
hour
meaning
the
position
held
by
his
brigade
previous
to
the
coming
of
the
order
to
advance
the
order
to
advance
was
given
and
the
brigade
advanced
in
good
order
as
possible
but
more
or
less
broken
up
by
the
masses
of
brush
and
heavy
grass
and
cactus
passing
through
the
line
of
the
first
brigade
mingling
with
them
and
charging
the
hill
in
conjunction
with
these
troops
as
well
as
some
few
infantry
who
had
extended
to
the
right
it
must
be
remembered
that
the
first
brigade
consisted
wholly
of
regulars
the
third
sixth
and
ninth
cavalry
while
the
second
brigade
had
that
remarkable
regiment
the
rough
riders
this
fact
may
account
for
their
breaking
through
the
lines
of
the
first
brigade
major
wessells
who
commanded
the
third
cavalry
in
that
fight
and
was
himself
wounded
at
the
close
of
the
first
charge
says
his
regiment
became
entangled
with
other
regiments
but
nevertheless
was
to
the
crest
as
soon
as
any
of
the
advance
of
the
whole
division
general
sumner
says
the
advance
was
made
under
heavy
infantry
fire
through
open
flat
ground
cut
up
by
wire
fences
to
the
creek
distant
about
yards
the
advance
was
made
in
good
order
the
enemy
fire
being
returned
only
under
favorable
opportunities
in
crossing
the
flat
one
officer
and
several
men
were
killed
and
several
officers
and
men
wounded
both
sides
of
the
creek
were
heavily
wooded
for
about
yards
the
creek
was
swollen
and
the
crossing
through
this
space
and
the
creek
was
made
with
great
difficulty
after
passing
through
the
thick
woods
the
ground
was
entirely
open
and
fenced
by
wire
from
this
line
it
was
necessary
to
storm
the
hill
upon
the
top
of
which
is
a
house
for
defense
the
slope
of
the
hill
is
very
difficult
but
the
assault
was
made
with
great
gallantry
and
with
much
loss
to
the
enemy
in
this
assault

had
been
given
up
the
first

directed
he
says
to
take
a
position
to
the
right
behind
the
river
bank
for
protection
while
moving
to
this
position
and
while
there
the
regiment
suffered
considerable
loss
after
an
interval
of
twenty
or
thirty
minutes
i
was
directed
to
form
line
of
battle
in
a
partially
open
field
facing
toward
the
blockhouses
and
strong
intrenchments
to
the
north
occupied
by
the
enemy
much
difficulty
was
found
on
account
of
the
dense
undergrowth
crossed
in
several
directions
by
wire
fences
as
a
part
of
the
cavalry
division
under
general
sumner
the
regiment
was
formed
in
two
lines
the
first
squadron
under
major
norvell
consisting
of
troops
a
b
e
and
i
leading
the
second
line
under
major
wint
consisting
of
troops
c
f
and
troop
d
having
crossed
farther
down
the
river
attached
itself
to
a
command
of
infantry
and
moved
with
that
command
on
the
second
blockhouse
the
regiment
advanced
in
this
formation
in
a
heavy
converging
fire
from
the
enemy
position
proceeding
but
a
short
distance
when
the
two
lines
were
united
into
one
the
advance
was
rapidly
continued
in
an
irregular
line
toward
the
blockhouses
and
intrenchments
to
the
right
front
during
this
advance
the
line
passed
some
troops
of
the
first
cavalry
which
i
think
had
previously
been
formed
on
our
right
several
losses
occurred
before
reaching
the
top
of
the
hill
first
lieutenant

he
arrived
on
its
crest
the
enemy
having
retreated
toward
the
northwest
to
the
second
and
third
blockhouses
new
lines
were
formed
and
a
rapid
advance
was
made
upon
these
new
positions
the
regiment
assisted
in
capturing
these
works
from
the
enemy
and
with
the
exception
of
troops
c
and
i
which
in
the
meantime
had
joined

took
up
a
position
to
the
north
of

blockhouse
remaining
there
all
night
major
norvell
who
commanded
the
first
squadron
of
the
tenth
cavalry
which
consisted
of
troops
a
b
e
and
i
gives
the
following
account
of
the
experiences
of
july
the
regiment
took
position
in
a
wood
and
here
suffered
considerable
loss
due
to
the
fact
that
the
whole
of
the
enemy
fire
appeared
to
be
directed
to
this
point
in
a
short
time
we
moved
out
of
the
wood
by
the
right
flank
and
then
deployed
to
the
left
being
then
directly
in
front
of
the
enemy
and
one
mile
distant
from
his
works
marked
by
three
houses
about
half
a
mile
from
one
another
the
enemy
was
strongly
entrenched
in
front
of
these
houses
the
line
consisting
of
the
cavalry
division
under
direction
of
sumner
moved
forward
in
double
time
under
a
terrific
fire
of
the
enemy
we
had
a
very
heavy
jungle
to
march
through
beside
the
river
san
juan
to
cross
and
during
our
progress
many
men
were
killed
and
wounded
the
troops
became
separated
from
one
another
though
the
general
line
was
pretty
well
preserved
the
works
of
the
enemy
were
carried
in
succession
by
the
troops
and
the
spaniards
were
steadily
driven
back
toward
the
town
to
their
last
ditches
we
now
found
ourselves
about
half
a
mile
from
the
city
but
the
troops
being
by
this
time
nearly
exhausted
here
intrenched
themselves
for
the
night
under
a
heavy
fire
by
dark
this
line
was
occupied
by
all
the
troops
engaged
during
the
day
the
official
reports
of
the
troop
commanders
of
the
tenth
cavalry
bring
out
a
few
more
particulars
which
serve
to
give
us
a
more
vivid
conception
of
this
moving
line
the
entire
cavalry
division
advanced
together
and
notwithstanding
the
roughness
of
the
ground
major
norvell
assures
us
the
line
was
pretty
well
preserved
troops
a
b
e
and
i
were
in
the
first
squadron
which
was
in
the

and

were
in
the
second

troop
d
made
its
advance
with
the
infantry
off
to
the
left
we
have
now
a
fair
knowledge
of
the
general
movement
of
the
whole
regiment
let
us
follow
the
fortunes
of
some
of
the
troops
and
by
that
means
get
nearer
to
the
work
done
by
the
individual
soldier
troop
a
was
on
the
right
of
the
leading
squadron
as
the
regiment
took
its
place
in
line
on
the
left
of
the
first
cavalry
and
moved
against
the
spanish
blockhouses
in
the
face
of
a
heavy
fire
making
a
rush
forward
without
intermission
a
portion
of
the
right
platoon
under
lieutenant
livermore
became
separated
in
one
of
the
thickets
and
under
instructions
received
personally
from
the
brigade
commander
who
seems
to
have
been
everywhere
where
he
was
needed
continued
up
the
slope
toward
his
right
and
toward
the
first
blockhouse
the
remainder
of
the
troop
commanded
by
captain
beck
and
lieutenant
mccoy
moved
in
the
same
direction
at
first
but
observing
that
on
account
of
the
shorter
distance
to
the
slope
from
that
end
of
the
line
a
large
number
of
troops
were
arriving
there
captain
beck
swung
his
troop
to
the
left
and
reached
the
summit
of
the
hill
between
the
second
and
third
blockhouses
and
on
arriving
received
a
message
by
an
aid
of
the
brigade
commander
to
hold
the
ridge
just
then
lieut
livermore
arrived
having
come
by
way
of
blockhouse
no
the
troop
now
being
together
held
the
crest
for
an
hour
at
times
the
fire
of
the
enemy
was
so
severe
and
captain
beck
force
so
small
that
there
was
great
danger
that
he
would
be
compelled
to
abandon
the
position
but
fortunately
at
the
most
critical
juncture
lieutenant
lyon
of
the
infantry
came
up
with
a
few
reinforcements
and
lieutenant
hughes
of
the
tenth
cavalry
with
a
hotchkiss

in
so
doing
caught
up
with
the
rest
of
the

the
first
half
of
the

after
attacking
the
blockhouse
on

of
the

position
and
then
moved
forward
with
the
first
regular
cavalry
and

volunteer
cavalry
until
the
troop
assembled
as
a
whole
when
it
reached
the
place
of
intrenchment
there
were
altogether
about
one
hundred
men
at
that
point
of
the
ridge
consisting
of
men
from
the
tenth
cavalry
and
of
the
rough
riders
it
is
claimed
by

made
his
way

bear
hearty
testimony
to
their
good
conduct
captain
jones
commanding
troop
f
says
i
could
only
do
justice
to
the
troop
by
mentioning
by
name
all
who
were
engaged
not
only
for
their
bravery
but
for
their
splendid
discipline
under
the
most
demoralizing
fire

says
the
entire

behaved
with
great
gallantry

distinguished
himself
captain

a
says
the
behaviour
of
the
enlisted
men
was
magnificent
paying
studious
attention
to
orders
while
on
the
firing
line
and
generally
exhibiting
an
intrepidity
which
marks
the
soldier
lieutenant
hughes
who
commanded
the
hotchkiss
gun
detachment
mentions
four
men
for
conspicuous
bravery
and
commends
his
entire
detachment
for
spirit
enterprise
and
good
behavior
the
official
story
is
that
the
entire
cavalry
division
advanced
under
orders
from
general
sumner
and
that
the
heft
of
its
first
blow
fell
upon
kettle
hill
which
was
soon
captured
and
on
the
crest
of
this
hill
the
troops
which
had
ascended
it
made
a
temporary
halt
reformed
their
lines
somewhat
and
immediately
advanced
upon
the
second
hill
to
the
help
of
that
part
of
the
cavalry
division
which
had
swung
to
the
left
in
the

and
also
to
the
help
of
the
infantry
who
were
coming
against
fort
san
juan
at
the
same
time
meanwhile
there
was
left
upon
kettle
hill
a
sufficient
garrison
or
force
to
prevent
its
being
recaptured
by
the
enemy
in
the
assault
on
kettle
hill
the
brigade
commander
colonel

had
been
wounded
and

and
also
in
the
rush
forward
through
the
jungle
and
high
grass
some

had
been
separated
from

tayabacoa
as
the
attacking
party
met
with
repulse
and
escaped
to
the
ship
in
the
darkness
several
of
their
wounded
were
left
on
shore
several
boats
sent
out
to
recover
them
had
returned
without
the
men
their
crews
fearing
to
go
on
shore
after
them
lieutenant
ahearn
volunteered
to
attempt
the
rescue
of
the
men
and
taking
a
boat
approached
the
shore
noiselessly
and
succeeded
in
his
undertaking
the
crew
accompanying
lieutenant
ahearn
was
made
up
of
men
from
troop
m
tenth
cavalry
and
behaved
so
well
that
the
four
were
given
medals
of
honor
for
their
marked
gallantry
the
action
of
lieutenant
ahearn
in
this
case
was
in
keeping
with
his
whole
military
career
he
has
ever
manifested
a
fondness
for
exceptional
service
and
has
never
failed
when
opportunity
occurred
to
display
a
noble
gallantry
on
the
side
of
humanity
nothing
appeals
to
him
so
commandingly
as
an
individual
needing
rescue
and
in
such
a
cause
he
immediately
rises
to
the
plane
the
noble
colored
soldiers
who
won
medals
on
that
occasion
were
all
privates
and
became
heroes
for
humanity
sake
their
names
deserve
a
place
in
this
history
outside
the
mere
official
table
they
were
dennis
bell
george
wanton
fitz
lee
and
william
tompkins
and
were
the
only
colored
soldiers
who
at
the
time
of
this
writing
have
won
medals
of
honor
in
the
spanish
war
others
however
may
yet
be
given
as
doubtless
others
are
deserved
the
heroic
service
performed
by
whole
regiments
as
in
the
case
of
the
infantry
should
entitle
every
man
in
it
to
a
medal
of
some
form
as
a

while

talked
and

filled
their

and
drank
deep
and
long
like
camels
who
after
days
of
travel
through
the
land
of
and
emptiness
have
reached
the
green
oasis
and
the
desert
spring
a
black
corporal
of
the
infantry
walked
wearily
up
to
the
hole
he
was
muddy
and
bedraggled
he
carried
no
cup
or
canteen
and
stretched
himself
out
over
the
in
the
stream
sipping
up
the
water
and
the
mud
together
out
of
the
shallow
pool
a
white
cavalryman
ran
toward
him
shouting
on
bunkie
here
my
cup
the
negro
looked
dazed
a
moment
and
not
a
few
of
the
spectators
showed
amazement
for
such
a
thing
had
rarely
if
ever
happened
in
the
army
before
you
said
the
black
corporal
we
are
all
fighting
under
the
same
flag
now
and
so
he
drank
out
of
the
white
man
cup
i
was
glad
to
see
that
i
was
not
the
only
man
who
had
come
to
recognize
the
justice
of
certain
constitutional
amendments
in
the
light
of
the
gallant
behaviour
of
the
colored
troops
throughout
the
battle
and
indeed
the
campaign
the
fortune
of
war
had
of
course
something
to
do
with
it
in
presenting
to
the
colored
troops
the
opportunities
for
distinguished
service
of
which
they
invariably
availed
themselves
to
the
fullest
extent
but
the
confidence
of
the
general
officers
in
their
superb
gallantry
which
the
event
proved
to
be
not
misplaced
added
still
more
and
it
is
a
fact
that
the
services
of
no
four
white
regiments
can
be
compared
with
those
rendered
by
the
four
colored
regiments
the
and
cavalry
and
the
and
infantry
they
were
to
the
front
at
la
guasima
at
caney
and
at
san
juan
and
what
was
the
severest
test
of
all
that
came
later

bonsal

report
of

the

forming
under
fire
a
gallant
charge
turning
now
to
the
centre
and
left
of
the
american
line
we
follow
the
advance
of
that
division
of
infantry
commanded
by
general
kent
and
which
met
the
brunt
of
spanish
resistance
at
san
juan
this
division
known
as
the
first
division
fifth
army
corps
consisted
of
three
brigades
composed
as
follows
first
brigade
hawkins
commanding
made
up
of
the
sixth
infantry
the
sixteenth
infantry
and
the
new

volunteers
the
second

commanding
made
up
of
the
second

the
tenth

and
the
infantry
the
third

by
colonel
wikoff
in
which
were
the
ninth
infantry
the
thirteenth
infantry
and
the
infantry
in
all
officers
and
men
thus
in
the
whole
division
there
were
eight
regiments
of
regular
infantry
and
one
volunteer
regiment
the
new
york
although
our
present
purpose
is
to
bring
into
view
the
special
work
of
the
infantry
it
will
be
necessary
to
embrace
in
our
scope
the
work
of
the
entire
division
in
order
to
lay
before
the
reader
the
field
upon
which
that
particular
regiment
won
such
lasting
credit
general
kent
who
commanded
the
division
a
most
accomplished
soldier
gives
a
lucid
account
of
the
whole
assault
as
seen
from
his
position
and
of
the
work
performed
by
his
division
in
his
report
dated
july
when
general
kent
division
arrived
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
san
juan
ford
and
found
itself
under
fire
and
the
trail
so
blocked
by
troops
of
the
cavalry
division
which
had
not
yet
deployed
to
the
right
that
direct
progress
toward
the
front
was
next
to
impossible
the
welcome
information
was
given
by
the
balloon
managers
that
a
trail
branched
off
to
the
left
from
the
main
trail
only
a
short
distance
back
from
the
ford
this
trail
led
to
a
ford
some
distance
lower
down
the
stream
and
nearly
facing
the
works
on
the
enemy
right
general
kent
on
learning
of
this
outlet
immediately
hastened
back
to
the
forks
and
meeting
the
new
york
regiment
the
rear
regiment
of
the
first
brigade
he
directed
that
regiment
into
this
trail
toward
the
ford
the
regiment
was
to
lead
the
way
through
this
new
trail
and
would
consequently
arrive
at
the
front
first
on
the
left
but
meeting
the
fire
of
the
enemy
the
first
battalion
of
the
regiment
apparently
became
panic
stricken
and
recoiled
upon
the
rest
of
the
regiment
the
regiment
then
lay
down
on
the
sides
of
the
trail
and
in
the
bushes
thoroughly
demoralized
wikoff
brigade
was
now
coming
up
and
it
was
directed
upon
the
same
trail
this
brigade
consisted
of
the
ninth
thirteenth
and
colonel
wikoff
was
directed
by
general
kent
to
move
his
brigade
across
the
creek
by
the
trail
the
left
fork
and
when
reaching
the
opposite
side
of
the
creek
to
put
the
brigade
in
line
on
the
left
of
the
trail
and
begin
the
attack
at
once
in
executing
this
order
the
entire
brigade
stumbled
through
and
over
hundreds
of
men
of
the
new
york
regiment
when
a
volunteer
regiment
broke
through
the
lines
of
the
ninth
cavalry
from
the
rear
that
regiment
was
in
its
place
on
the
field
in
line
of
battle
with
its
morale
perfect
it
was
under
discipline
and
delivering
its
fire
with
regularity
it
had
an
absolute
right
to
its
place
the
was
in
no
such
attitude
and
general
kent
directed
the
advance
through
it
in
these
words
tell
the
brigade
to
pay
no
attention
to
this
sort
of
thing
it
is
highly
irregular
the
ninth
cavalry
position
was
exactly
the
position
of
the
was
to
the
eyes
of
general
kent
highly
irregular
the
three
regiments
of
this
brigade
were
to
take
their
positions
on
the
left
of
the
ford
after
crossing
the
stream
in
the
following
order
on
the
extreme
left
the
next
to
it
in
the
centre
of
the
brigade
the
ninth
and
on
the
right
of
the
brigade
the
thirteenth
in
approaching
the
ford
the
ninth
and
became
mixed
and
crossed
in
the
following
order
first
one
battalion
of
the
ninth
then
a
battalion
of
the
then
the
second
battalion
of
the
ninth
followed
by
the
second
battalion
of
the
the
line
was
formed
under
fire
and
while
superintending
its
formation
the
brigade
commander
colonel
wikoff
came
under
observation
and
was
killed
worth
who
succeeded
him
was
seriously
wounded
within
five
minutes
after
having
taking
command
and
liscum
who
next
assumed
charge
of
the
brigade
had
hardly
learned
that
he
was
in
command
before
he
too
was
disabled
by
a
spanish
shot
by
this
time
however
the
formation
was
about
complete
and
the
brigade
ready
to
begin
the
advance
leaving
wikoff
brigade
in
line
ready
to
begin
the
advance
we
must
now
return
in
our
narrative
to
the
main
ford
where
the
major
portions
of
hawkins
and
pearson
brigades
are
massed
and
follow
the
various
regiments
as
they
come
to
their
places
in
the
battle
line
preparing
for
the
onslaught
after
crossing
the
ford
with
the
sixth
infantry
pursuant
to
the
orders
given
by
lieutenant
miley
in
the
name
of
general
shafter
general
hawkins
attempted
to
flank
the
enemy
by
a
movement
to
the
left
the
sixth
infantry
leading
and
the
sixteenth
intending
to
pass
beyond
it
in
its
rear
and
join
to
its
left
the
sixth
in
passing
to
its
intended
position
passed
to
the
left
of
the
sixth
cavalry
which
held
the
left
of
the
line
of
the
cavalry
division
which
had
crossed
the
ford
and
deployed
to
the
right
reaching
beyond
the
spanish
lines
in
that
direction
or
at
least
it
was
able
to
reach
the
extreme
right
of
the
enemy
the
sixth
infantry
continued
this
line
southward
and
it
was
to
be
farther
extended
by
the
sixteenth
before
this
disposition
could
be
effected
the
fire
of
the
enemy
became
so
severe
that
an
advance
movement
was
started
and
the
sixth
lined
up
facing
the
fort
on
the
hill
with
only
one
company
and
a
half
of
the
sixteenth
on
its
left
while
hawkins
and
wikoff
brigades
were
preparing
for
the
advance
upon
the
enemy
works
pearson
brigade
was
approaching
the
ford
hurrying
to
the
support
the
regiment
of
this
brigade
was
detached
from
the
brigade
and
sent
directly
forward
on
the
main
trail
with
orders
to
the
firing
line
this
regiment
crossed
the
san
juan
river
to
the
left
of
the
main
ford
and
rushed
forward
to
support
hawkins
left
in
the
meantime
the
two
other
regiments
of
the
brigade
the
second
and
tenth
which
had
preceded
the
in
their
march
from
el
poso
had
been
deflected
to
the
left
by
order
of
the
division
commander
and
were
passing
to
the
front
over
the
trail
previously
taken
by
wikoff
brigade
crossing
the
san
juan
at
the
lower
ford
the
tenth
crossed
in
advance
and
formed
in
close
order
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
stream
its
line
facing
northwest
it
was
soon
after
however
put
in
battle
formation
and
moved
to
the
right
until
it
connected
with
the
the
second
regiment
crossed
the
ford
in
the
rear
of
the
tenth
having
been
delayed
considerably
by
the
new
york
volunteers
who
still
blocked
the
way
between
the
forks
and
the
lower
ford
after
crossing
the
ford
the
second
put
itself
in
line
on
the
left
of
the
tenth
the
whole
brigade
being
now
in
position
to
support
the
first
and
third
brigades
in
their
charge
this
movement
of
colonel
pearson
brigade
had
not
been
made
without
hardship
and
loss
all
of
the
regiments
came
under
the
enemy
fire
before
reaching
the
san
juan
river
and
many
men
were
killed
or
wounded
while
the
regiments
were
gaining
their
positions
the
movement
was
so
well
executed
as
to
call
forth
from
the
division
commander
the
following
enconium
i
observed
this
movement
from
the
fort
san
juan
hill
colonel
pearson
tenth
infantry
commanding
the
second
brigade
and
the
officers
and
troops
under
his
command
deserve
great
credit
for
the
soldierly
manner
in
which
this
movement
was
executed
although
we
left
wikoff
brigade
standing
in
line
on
the
left
of
the
lower
ford
we
must
not
imagine
that
it
remained
in
that
position
until
the
above
movement
on
the
part
of
the
second
brigade
had
been
accomplished
there
was
no
standing
still
in
the
fierce
fire
to
which
the
men
of
that
brigade
were
at
that
time
subjected
a
fire
which
had
already
cut
down
in
rapid
succession
three
brigade
commanders
the
formation
was
no
sooner
completed
than
the
rapid
advance
began
the
thirteenth
infantry
holding
the
right
of
the
brigade
moved
to
the
right
and
front
while
the
ninth
and
moved
almost
directly
to
the
front
at
first
thus
partially
gaining
the
flank
of
the
enemy
position
the
whole
line
moved
with
great
rapidity
across
the
open
field
and
up
the
hill
so
that
when
the
second
and
tenth
infantry
came
to
their
position
as
support
the
heroic
third
brigade
was
well
up
the
heights
to
the
right
of
the
third
brigade
the
first
brigade
containing
the
gallant
sixth
under
colonel
egbert
and
the
sixteenth
was
advancing
also
and
the
two
brigades
arrived
at
the
fort
almost
simultaneously
so
that
the
division
commander
in
speaking
of
the
capture
says
credit
is
almost
equally
due
the
sixth
ninth
thirteenth
sixteenth
and
regiments
of
infantry
to
the
third
brigade
he
gives
the
credit
of
turning
the
enemy
right
let
us
now
examine
more
closely
that
sweep
of
the
third
brigade
from
the
left
of
the
lower
ford
to
san
juan
hill
in
order
to
trace
more
distinctly
the
pathway
of
honor
made
for
itself
by
the
this
regiment
formed
left
front
into
line
under
fire
and
advanced
over
the
flat
in
good
order
and
then
reformed
under
shelter
of
the
hill
preparatory
to
the
final
charge
upon
the
enemy
intrenchments
the
experience
of
the
companies
in
crossing
the
flat
is
told
by
the
company
commanders
one
company
under
the
orders
of
its
captain
formed
line
of
skirmishers
and
advanced
in
good
order
at
rapid
gait
reaching
the
foot
of
the
hill
almost
exhausted
this
was
about
the
experience
of
all
but
this
company
is
mentioned
because
it
was
the
first
company
of
the
regiment
to
reach
the
top
of
the
hill
in
crossing
the
flat
there
was
necessarily
some
mixing
of
companies
and
in
some
instances
men
were
separated
from
their
officers
but
those
who
escaped
the
enemy
bullets
made
their
way
across
that
plain
of
fire
and
were
ready
to
join
in
the
charge
up
the
hill
where
only
brave
men
could
go
there
was
but
a
moment
pause
for
breath
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
and
the
general
charge
all
along
the
line
began
the
sixth
infantry
probably
taking
the
initiative
although
the
gallant
colonel
egbert
of
that
regiment
since
killed
in
the
philippines
makes
no
such
claim
in
his
farewell
official
report
of
the
sixth
he
thus
describes
the
final
act
we
were
now
unexpectedly
lieutenant
parker
made
aware
by
the
heavy
fire
from
the
hill
that
a
conflict
was
going
on
in
his
front
opened
fire
with
his
gatlings
most
effectively
on
the
intrenchments
while
from
far
down
on
my
left
i
heard
cheering
and
shouts
and
saw
coming
up
the
slope
towards
us
a
multitude
of
skirmishers
as
they
drew
nearer
we
distinguished
the
tall
figure
of
general
hawkins
with
his
aide
lieutenant
ord
sixth
infantry
charging
at
the
head
of
the
skirmishers
and
waving
their
hats
when
the
charge
came
up
nearly
abreast
of
where
the
sixth
stood
in
the
road
i
ordered
the
companies
out
through
the
gaps
in
the
wire
fence
to
join
it
and
they
complied
with
the
same
alacrity
and
enthusiasm
that
they
had
displayed
in
entering
this
bloody
field
the
gatlings
redoubled
their
fierce
grinding
of
bullets
on
the
spanish
despite
which
there
still
came
a
savage
fire
from
the
blockhouse
and
trenches
here
the
gallant
captain
wetherell
sixth
infantry
fell
shot
through
the
forehead
at
the
head
of
his
company
and
i
received
a
mauser
bullet
through
the
left
lung
which
disabled
me
but
the
blood
of
the
troops
was
now
up
and
no
loss
of
officers
or
men
could
stop
them
they
charged
up
the
incline
until
coming
to
a
steep
ridge
near
the
top
they
were
brought
to
a
stand
by
the
hail
of
bullets
from
the
gatlings
against
the
summit
as
soon
as
this
could
be
stopped
by
a
signal
the
mingled
troops
of
the
sixth
sixteenth
thirteenth
and
swept
up
and
over
the
hill
and
it
was
won
from
testimony
gathered
on
the
evening
of
the
fight
it
was
concluded
that
there
were
more
men
of
the
infantry
on
the
ridge
in
this
first
occupation
than
of
any
other
regiment
but
all
of
the
regiments
of
the
division
had
done
admirably
and
the
brave
blacks
of
the
won
on
that
day
a
standing
in
arms
with
the
bravest
of
the
brave
the
spaniards
although
driven
from
their
first
line
by
no
means
gave
up
the
fight
but
retreating
to
a
line
of
intrenchments
about
eight
hundred
yards
in
the
rear
they
opened
upon
the
a
fire
almost
as
hot
as
before
and
the
troops
found
it
difficult
to
hold
what
they
had
gained
the
supporting
regiments
were
coming
up
and
strengthening
the
line
the
men
meanwhile
entrenching
themselves
under
fire
as
rapidly
as
possible
the
thirteenth
infantry
was
immediately
ordered
off
to
the
right
to
assist
the
cavalry
division
especially
the
rough
riders
who
were
said
to
be
in
danger
of
having
their
flank
turned
here
it
remained
under
fire
all
night
the
advance
and
charge
of
the
made
up
only
a
part
of
the
advance
and
charge
of
the
third
brigade
and
this
in
turn
was
part
of
the
attack
and
assault
made
by
the
whole
infantry
division
a
movement
also
participated
in
at
the
same
hour
by
the
cavalry
division
so
that
regarded
as
a
whole
it
was
a
mighty
blow
delivered
on
the
right
and
centre
by
of
the
american
army
and
its
effect
was
stunning
although
its
full
weight
had
not
been
realized
by
the
foe
the
part
sustained
in
the
assault
by
each
regiment
may
be
estimated
by
the
losses
experienced
by
each
in
killed
and
wounded
judged
by
this
standard
the
brunt
fell
upon
the
sixth
sixteenth
thirteenth
and
all
of
which
regiments
lost
heavily
considering
the
short
time
of
the
action
the
movement
by
which
the
reached
its
position
on
that
memorable
of
july
has
called
forth
especial
mention
by
the
regimental
commander
and
by
the
acting
assistant
of
the
brigade
it
was
also
noted
immediately
after
the
battle
by
all
the
newspaper
writers
as
one
of
the
striking
occurrences
of
the
day
the
regiment
on
coming
under
fire
marched
about
one
mile
by
the
left
flank
and
then
formed
left
front
into
line
on
its
leading
company
company
g
commanded
by
captain
brereton
the
first
man
of
the
regiment
to
take
position
in
the
line
was
the
first
sergeant
of
g
company
woods
this
company
when
reaching
its
position
formed
on
left
into
line
under
a
severe
fire
in
front
and
a
fire
in
the
rear
the
other
companies
forming
in
the
same
manner
with
more
or
less
regularity
to
its
left
as
soon
as
the
line
was
formed
the
order
was
given
to
charge
the
advance
was
made
across
an
open
meadow
during
which
several
officers
were
wounded
among
them
the
officers
of
company
f
the
command
of
that
company
devolving
upon
its
first
sergeant
william
rainey
who
conducted
the
company
successfully
to
the
crest
of
the
hill
the
description
of
the
movement
of
company
d
as
given
by
lieutenant
kerwin
who
was
placed
in
command
of
that
company
after
its
officers
had
been
shot
is
a
very
interesting
document
lieutenant
kerwin
claims
to
have
made
his
report
from
close
inquiries
and
from
personal
observation
according
to
this
report
the
company
was
led
across
the
san
juan
creek
by
its
captain
ducat
the
second
lieutenant
of
the
company
gurney
following
it
and
keeping
the
men
well
closed
up
while
crossing
the
company
encountered
a
terrific
fire
and
after
advancing
about
ten
yards
beyond
the
stream
went
through
a
wire
fence
to
the
right
and
advanced
to
an
embankment
about
twenty
yards
from
the
right
bank
of
the
stream
here
captain
ducat
gave
the
order
to
advance
to
the
attack
and
the
whole
company
opened
out
in
good
order
in
line
of
skirmishers
and
moved
rapidly
across
the
open
plain
to
the
foot
of
san
juan
hill
in
making
this
movement
across
the
plain
the
line
was
under
fire
and
the
brave
lieutenant
gurney
was
killed
and
first
sergeant
ellis
corporal
keys
and
privates
robinson
and
johnson
wounded
it
was
a
race
with
death
but
the
company
arrived
at
the
base
of
the
hill
in
good
form
though
exhausted
after
breathing
a
moment
the
men
were
ready
to
follow
their
intrepid
commander
captain
ducat
up
the
hill
and
at
twelve
they
gained
the
summit
being
the
first
company
of
the
regiment
to
reach
the
top
of
the
hill
just
as
they
reached
the
crest
the
brave
ducat
fell
shot
through
the
hip
probably
by
a
spanish
sharpshooter
thus
depriving
the
company
of
its
last
commissioned
officer
and
leaving
its
first
sergeant
also
disabled
the
commander
of
the
regiment
speaks
of
its
doings
in
a
very
modest
manner
but
in
a
tone
to
give
the
reader
confidence
in
what
he
says
he
became
temporarily
separated
from
the
regiment
but
made
his
way
to
the
crest
of
the
hill
in
company
with
the
adjutant
and
there
found
a
part
of
his
command
he
says
a
creditable
number
of
the
men
of
his
regiment
reached
the
top
of
the
hill
among
the
first
to
arrive
there
the
commander
of
the
second
battalion
captain
wygant
crossed
the
meadow
or
flat
some
distance
ahead
of
the
battalion
but
as
the
men
subsequently
charged
up
the
hill
he
was
unable
to
keep
up
with
them
so
rapid
was
their
gait
it
was
from
this
battalion
that
captain
ducat
company
broke
away
and
charged
on
the
right
of
the
battalion
arriving
as
has
been
said
first
on
the
top
of
the
hill
as
the
regiment
arrived
captain
wygant
finding
himself
the
ranking
officer
on
the
ground
assembled
it
and
assigned
each
company
its
place
captain
dodge
who
commanded
company
c
in
this
assault
and
who
subsequently
died
in
the
yellow
fever
hospital
at
siboney
mentions
the
fact
that
captain
wygant
led
the
advance
in
person
and
says
that
in
the
charge
across
the
open
field
the
three
companies
c
b
and
h
became
so
intermixed
that
it
was
impossible
for
the
company
commanders
to
distinguish
their
own
men
from
those
of
the
other
companies
yet
he
says
he
had
the
names
of
twenty
men
of
his
own
company
who
reached
the
trenches
at
fort
san
juan
in
that
perilous
rush
on
that
fiery
the
testimony
of
all
the
officers
of
the
regiment
is
to
the
effect
that
the
men
behaved
splendidly
and
eight
of
them
have
been
given
certificates
of
merit
for
gallantry
in
the
action
of
july
the
losses
of
the
regiment
in
that
advance
were
numerous
the
killed
wounded
and
missing
amounted
to
which
number
was
swelled
to
during
the
next
two
days
so
many
men
falling
in
so
short
a
time
while
advancing
in
open
order
tells
how
severe
was
the
fire
they
were
facing
and
serves
to
modify
the
opinion
which
was
so
often
expressed
about
the
time
the
war
broke
out
to
the
effect
that
the
spanish
soldiers
were
wanting
both
in
skill
and
bravery
they
contradicted
this
both
at
el
caney
and
at
san
juan
in
the
latter
conflict
they
held
their
ground
until
the
last
moment
and
inflicted
a
loss
upon
their
assailants
equal
to
the
number
engaged
in
the
defence
of
the
heights
since
july
expatiation
on
the
cowardice
and
lack
of
skill
of
the
spanish
soldier
has
ceased
to
be
a
profitable
literary
occupation
too
many
journalists
and
correspondents
were
permitted
to
witness
the
work
of
spanish
sharpshooters
and
to
see
their
obstinate
resistance
to
the
advance
of
our
troops
to
allow
comments
upon
the
inefficiency
of
the
spanish
army
to
pass
unnoticed
our
army
from
the
beginning
was
well
impressed
with
the
character
of
the
foe
and
nerved
itself
accordingly
the
bravery
of
our
own
soldiers
was
fully
recognized
by
the
men
who
surrendered
to
our
army
and
who
were
capable
of
appreciating
it
because
they
themselves
were
not
wanting
in
the
same
qualities

they
now
manifested
their
appreciation
of
the
gallantry
of

black

in
an
ovation
of
applause
and
cheers
this
was

the

bivouacked
in

leading
from

with
the

and
the
issuing
of
rations
and
ammunition
the
first
half
of
the
night
gave
no
time
for

and
shortly
after
apprehensions
of
a
spanish
attack
put
every
one
on
the
alert
at
the
march
to
the
rear
was
commenced
and
the
entire
division
passed
around
by

advanced
to

reaching

its

on

on

running
out
from

to

this
intrenchment
was
the

won
great
credit
in
its
advance
upon
the
enemy
but
it
was
to
win
still
greater
in
the
field
of
humanity
capt
leavel
who
commanded
company
a
said
it
would
be
hard
to
particularize
in
reporting
upon
the
men
of
the
company
all
officers
privates
even
newly
joined
recruits
showed
a
desire
to
do
their
duty
yea
more
than
their
duty
which
would
have
done
credit
to
seasoned
veterans
too
much
can
not
be
said
of
their
courage
willingness
and
endurance
captain
wygant
who
commanded
the
second
battalion
of
the
regiment
says
the
gallantry
and
bearing
shown
by
the
officers
and
soldiers
of
the
regiment
under
this
trying
ordeal
was
such
that
it
has
every
reason
to
be
proud
of
its
record
the
losses
of
the
regiment
which
are
shown
by
the
official
records
show
the
fire
they
were
subjected
to
the
casualties
were
greater
among
the
officers
than
the
men
which
is
accounted
for
by
the
fact
that
the
enemy
had
posted
in
the
trees
sharpshooters
whose
principal
business
was
to
pick
them
off
there
is
no
countenance
given
in
official
literature
to
the
absurd
notion
maintained
by
some
that
it
was
necessary
for
the
officers
of
black
troops
to
expose
themselves
unusually
in
order
to
lead
their
troops
and
that
this
fact
accounts
for
excessive
losses
among
them
the
fact
is
that
the
regular
officer
code
is
such
that
he
is
compelled
to
occupy
the
place
in
battle
assigned
him
in
the
tactics
and
no
matter
how
great
his
cowardice
of
heart
may
be
he
must
go
forward
until
ordered
to
halt
the
penalty
of
cowardice
is
something
to
be
dreaded
above
wounds
or
even
death
by
some
natures
colored
troops
are
brave
men
when
led
by
white
as
a
matter
of
fact
there
is
very
little
leading
of
any
sort
by
officers
in
battle
the
officer
place
is
in
the
rear
of
the
firing
line
directing
not
leading
and
it
is
his
right
and
duty
to
save
his
own
life
if
possible
and
that
of
every
man
in
his
command
even
while
seeking
to
destroy
the
enemy
in
obedience
to
orders
the
record
of
the
for
bravery
was
established
beyond
question
when
it
swept
across
that
open
flat
and
up
san
juan
hill
on
that
hot
of
july
after
lying
in
the
trenches
until
july
the
news
reached
the
camp
of
the
that
yellow
fever
had
broken
out
in
the
army
and
that
a
large
hospital
and
had
been
established
at
siboney
about
that
day
an
order
came
to
the
commanding
officer
of
the
regiment
directing
him
to
proceed
with
his
regiment
to
siboney
and
report
to
the
medical
officer
there
the
regiment
started
on
its
march
at
numbering
at
that
time
companies
containing
officers
and
men
marching
on
in
the
night
going
through
thickets
and
across
streams
the
men
were
heard
singing
a
fine
old
hymn
when
through
the
deep
waters
i
call
thee
to
go
the
rivers
of
woe
shall
not
thee
for
i
will
be
with
thee
thy
troubles
to
bless
and
sanctify
to
thee
they
deepest
distress
in
view
of
what
was
before
them
the
words
were
very
appropriate
they
arrived
on
the
hill
at
siboney
at
on
the
morning
of
july
without
discussing
the
graphic
story
told
by
correspondents
of
the
highest
respectability
describing
the
regiment
as
volunteering
to
a
man
to
nurse
the
sick
and
dying
at
siboney
we
will
rather
follow
the
official
records
of
their
doings
in
that
place
on
arriving
at

on
the
morning
of

in

of

met

that

was
on
the
ground
colonel
greenleaf
was
just
leaving
the

but
major

his
successor
manifested
his
great
pleasure
in
seeing
this
form
of
assistance
arrive
such
a
scene
of
misery
presented
itself
to
major
markely
eyes
that

as
he
was
was
greatly
affected
and
assured
major
la
garde
that
he
was
prepared
personally
to
sink
every
other
consideration
and
devote
himself
to
giving
what
assistance
he
could
in
caring
for
the
sick
and
that
he
believed
his
whole
regiment
would
feel
as
he
did
when
they
came
to
see
the
situation
in
this
he
was
not
mistaken
the
officers
and
men
of
the
infantry
did
give
themselves
up
to
the
care
of
the
sick
and
dying
furnishing
all
help
in
their
power
until
their
own
health
and
strength
gave
way
in
some
instances
laying
down
even
their
lives
in
this
noble
work
on
the
day
of
arrival
seventy
men
were
called
for
to
nurse
yellow
fever
patients
and
do
other
work
about
the
hospital
more
than
this
number
immediately
volunteered
to
enter
upon
a
service
which
they
could
well
believe
meant
death
to
some
of
them
the
camp
was
so
crowded
and
filthy
that
the
work
of
cleaning
it
was
begun
at
once
by
the
men
of
the
and
day
by
day
they
labored
as
their
strength
would
permit
in
policing
the
camp
cooking
the
food
for
themselves
and
for
the
hospital
unloading
supplies
taking
down
and
removing
tents
and
numberless
other
details
of
necessary
labor
despite
all
the
care
that
could
be
taken
under
such
conditions
as
were
found
at
siboney
the
yellow
fever
soon
overran
the
entire
camp
and
of
the
officers
of
the
regiment
had
died
more
were
expected
to
die
were
dangerously
ill
and
more
or
less
so
out
of
the
whole
sixteen
there
were
but
three
really
fit
for
duty
and
often
out
of
the
whole
regiment
it
would
be
impossible
to
get
men
who
could
go
on
fatigue
duty
out
of
the
men
who
marched
to
siboney
only
escaped
sickness
and
on
one
day
were
down
those
who
would
recover
remained
weak
and
unfit
for
labor
silently
without
murmuring
did
these
noble
heroes
officers
and
men
stand
at
their
post
ministering
to
the
necessities
of
their
fellowman
until
the
welcome
news
came
that
the
regiment
would
be
sent
north
and
the
hospital
closed
as
soon
as
possible
on
august
major
la
garde
more
entitled
to
the
honor
of
being
classed
among
the
heroes
of
santiago
than
some
whose
opportunities
of
brilliant
display
were
vastly
superior
succumbed
to
the
disease
the
fact
should
be
borne
in
mind
that
all
of
these
men
officers
soldiers
and
surgeons
went
upon
this
duty
after
the
severe
labors
of
assault
of
july
and
the
two
weeks
of
terrible
strain
and
exposure
in
the
trenches
before
santiago
and
with
the
sick
and
wounded
consequent
upon
these
battles
and
labors
none
were
strong
on
july
the
day
after
the
left
the
trenches
the
surrender
was
made
and
on
the
next
morning
the
final
ceremonies
of
turning
over
santiago
to
the
american
forces
took
place
and
the
soldiers
were
allowed
to
come
out
of
their
ditches
and
enter
into
more
comfortable
camps
the
hardships
of
the
period
after
the
surrender
were
not
much
less
than
those
experienced
while
in
the
lines
on
the
of
august
the
infantry
having
obtained
an
honorable
release
from
its
perilous
duty
marched
out
of
siboney
with
band
playing
and
colors
flying
to
go
on
board
the
transport
for
montauk
but
of
the
men
who
marched
into
siboney
only
were
able
to
march
out
directed
by
out
of
the
officers
that
marched
in
with
them
altogether
there
were
officers
and
men
who
went
on
board
the
transport
but
all
except
the
number
first
given
were
unable
to
take
their
places
in
the
ranks
they
went
on
board
the
steamer
nueces
and
coming
from
an
infected
camp
no
doubt
great
care
was
taken
that
the
transport
should
arrive
at
its
destination
in
a
good
condition
although
there
was
sickness
on
board
there
were
no
deaths
on
the
passage
and
the
nueces
arrived
in
port
one
of
the
cleanest
ships
that
came
to
that
place
the
official
report
states
that
the
nueces
arrived
at
montauk
point
september
with
troops
on
board
sick
no
deaths
on
the
voyage
and
not
infected
worn
out
by
the
hard
service
the
regiment
remained
a
short
time
at
montauk
and
then
returned
to
its
former
station
fort
douglass
utah
leaving
its
camp
at
montauk
in
such
a
thoroughly
creditable
condition
as
to
elicit
official
remark
while
the
infantry
had
without
doubt
the
hardest
service
after
the
surrender
of
any
of
the
colored
regiments
the
others
were
not
slumbering
at
ease
lying
in
the
trenches
almost
constantly
for
two
weeks
drenched
with
rains
scorched
by
the
burning
sun
at
times
and
chilled
by
cool
nights
subsisting
on
food
not
of
the
best
and
poorly
cooked
cut
off
from
news
and
kept
in
suspense
when
the
surrender
finally
came
it
found
our
army
generally
very
greatly
reduced
in
vital
force
during
the
period
following
from
july
to
about
the
same
date
in
august
the
fell
with
all
its
weight
upon
the
troops
rendering
them
an
easy
prey
to
the
climatic
influences
by
which
they
were
surrounded
pernicious
malarial
fever
bowel
troubles
and
yellow
fever
were
appearing
in
all
the
regiments
and
the
colored
troops
appeared
as
susceptible
as
their
white
comrades
the
theory
had
been
advanced
that
they
were
less
susceptible
to
malarial
fever
and
in
a
certain
sense
this
appears
to
be
true
but
the
experience
of
our
army
in
cuba
as
well
as
army
statistics
published
before
the
cuban
war
do
not
bear
out
the
popular
view
of
the
theory
the
best
that
can
be
said
from
the
experience
of
cuba
is
to
the
effect
that
the
blacks
may
be
less
liable
to
yellow
fever
and
may
more
quickly
rally
from
the
effects
of
malarial
fever
these
conclusions
are
however
by
no
means
well
established
the
suffered
excessively
from
fevers
of
both
kinds
and
in
the
judgment
of
the
commanding
officer
of
the
regiment
effectually
showed
that
colored
soldiers
were
not
more
immune
from
cuban
fever
than
white
but
we
must
remember
that
the
service
of
the
was
exceptional
the
infantry
lost
but
one
man
during
the
whole
campaign
from
climatic
disease
john
lewis
and
it
is
believed
that
could
he
have
received
proper
medical
care
his
life
would
have
been
saved
yet
this
regiment
suffered
severely
from
fever
as
did
also
the
ninth
and
tenth
cavalry
arriving
at
montauk
early
the
author
had
the
opportunity
to
see
the
whole
of
the
fifth
army
corps
disembark
on
its
return
from
cuba
and
was
so
impressed
with
its
forlorn
appearance
that
he
then
wrote
of
it
as
coming
home
on
stretchers
pale
emaciated
weak
and
halting
they
came
with
sick
and
reporting
deaths
on
the
voyage
but
as
general
wheeler
said
in
his
report
the
great
bulk
of
the
troops
that
were
at
santiago
were
by
no
means
well
never
before
had
the
people
seen
an
army
of
stalwart
men
so
suddenly
transformed
into
an
army
of
invalids
and
yet
while
all
the
regiments
arriving
showed
the
effects
of
the
hardships
they
had
endured
the
black
regulars
excepting
the
infantry
appeared
to
have
slightly
the
advantage
the
arrival
of
the
tenth
cavalry
in
good
condition
was
an
early
cheering
item
in
the
stream
of
suffering
and
debility
landing
from
the
transports
seeing
all
of
the
troops
land
and
remaining
at
camp
wikoff
until
its
days
were
nearly
numbered
the
writer
feels
sure
that
the
colored
troops
arrived
from
the
front
in
as
good
condition
as
the
best
and
that
they
recuperated
with
marked
comparative
rapidity
the
chaplain
of
the
infantry
while
en
route
to
join
his
regiment
at
montauk
thinking
seriously
over
the
condition
of
the
men
returning
from
such
a
hard
experience
concluded
that
nothing
would
be
more
grateful
to
them
than
a
reasonable
supply
of
ripe
fruit
fresh
from
the
orchards
and
fields
he
therefore
sent
a
dispatch
to
the
daily
evening
news
published
in
bridgeton
asking
the
citizens
of
that
community
to
contribute
a
carload
of
melons
and
fruits
for
the
men
of
the
or
for
the
whole
camp
if
they
so
wished
subsequently
mentioning
the
fact
to
the
commanding
officer
of
the
regiment
daggett
he
heartily
commended
the
idea
believing
that
the
fruit
would
be
very
beneficial
the
good
people
of
bridgeton
took
hold
of
the
matter
heartily
and
in
a
short
time
forwarded
to
the
regiment
more
than
four
hundred
of
jersey
finest
watermelons
fresh
from
the
vines
these
were
distributed
judiciously
and
the
health
of
the
men
began
to
improve
forthwith
soon
five
hundred
more
arrived
sent
by
a
patriotic
citizen
of
philadelphia
these
were
also
distributed
ladies
of
brooklyn
forwarded
peaches
and
vegetables
and
supplies
of
all
sorts
now
were
coming
in
abundance
our
men
improved
so
rapidly
as
to
be
the
occasion
of
remark
by
correspondents
of
the
press
they
were
spoken
of
as
being
apparently
in
good
condition
while
engaged
in
the
work
of
supplying
their
physical
wants
the
chaplain
was
taken
to
task
by
a
correspondent
of
leslie
for
being
too
much
concerned
in
getting
a
carload
of
watermelons
for
his
regiment
to
go
over
to
a
graveyard
and
pray
over
the
dead
the
next
day
the
chaplain
made
haste
to
go
over
to
that
particular
graveyard
to
relieve
the
country
from
the
crying
shame
that
the
correspondent
had
pointed
out
only
to
find
two
men
already
there
armed
with
and
one
of
them
especially
so
fearful
that
he
would
not
get
a
chance
to
read
a
prayer
over
a
dead
soldier
that
the
chaplain
found
it
necessary
to
assure
him
that
the
opportunity
to
pray
should
not
be
taken
from
him
and
thus
another
popular
horror
was
found
to
be
without
reality
the
colored
ladies
of
brooklyn
organized
a
soldiers
aid
society
and
besides
contributing
in
a
general
way
as
already
mentioned
also
made
and
presented
to
the
soldiers
about
four
hundred
pies
which
were
most
highly
appreciated
they
also
prepared
a
tasty
souvenir
commemorative
of
the
heroic
work
performed
by
the
troops
in
cuba
and
expressive
of
high
appreciation
of
the
gallantry
of
the
colored
regiments
a
beautiful
stand
of
colors
was
also
procured
for
the
infantry
which
were
subsequently
presented
to
the
regiment
with
appropriate
ceremonies
at
the
camp
were
three
colored
chaplains
and
one
colored
surgeon
serving
with
the
regular
army
and
their
presence
was
of
great
value
in
the
way
of
accustoming
the
people
at
large
to
beholding
colored
men
as
commissioned
officers
to
none
were
more
attention
shown
than
to
these
colored
men
and
there
was
apparently
no
desire
to
infringe
upon
their
rights
occasionally
a
very
petty
social
movement
might
be
made
by
an
insignificant
with
a
view
of
humiliating
a
negro
chaplain
but
such
efforts
usually
died
without
harm
to
those
aimed
at
and
apparently
without
special
comfort
to
those
who
engineered
them
the
following
paragraphs
written
while
in
camp
at
the
time
indicated
in
them
may
serve
a
good
purpose
by
their
insertion
here
showing
as
they
do
the
reflections
of
the
writer
as
well
as
in
outlining
the
more
important
facts
associated
with
that
remarkable
encampment
camp
wikoff
and
its
lessons
now
that
the
days
of
this
camp
are
drawing
to
a
close
it
is
profitable
to
recall
its
unique
history
and
gather
up
some
of
the
lessons
it
has
taught
us
despite
all
the
sensationalism
investigations
testings
experimentation
and
general
condemnation
the
camp
at
montauk
accomplished
what
was
intended
and
was
itself
a
humane
and
patriotic
establishment
it
is
not
for
me
to
say
whether
a
better
site
might
not
have
been
selected
or
whether
the
camp
might
not
have
been
better
managed
i
will
take
it
for
granted
that
improvement
might
have
been
made
in
both
respects
but
our
concern
is
rather
with
what
was
than
with
what
might
have
been
to
appreciate
camp
wikoff
we
must
consider
two
things
specially
first
its
purpose
and
secondly
the
short
time
allowed
to
prepare
it
and
then
go
over
the
whole
subject
and
properly
estimate
its
extent
and
the
amount
of
labor
involved
the
intention
of
the
camp
was
to
afford
a
place
where
our
troops
returning
from
cuba
prostrated
with
climatic
fever
and
probably
infected
with
yellow
fever
might
receive
proper
medical
treatment
and
care
until
the
diseases
were
subdued
the
site
was
selected
with
this
in
view
and
the
conditions
were
admirably
suited
to
such
a
purpose
completely
isolated
on
dry
soil
with
dry
pure
air
cool
climate
away
from
mosquitoes
the
camp
seemed
all
that
was
desired
for
a
great
field
hospital
here
the
sick
could
come
and
receive
the
best
that
nature
had
to
bestow
in
the
way
of
respite
from
the
heat
and
pure
ocean
breezes
and
taken
altogether
the
experiences
of
august
and
a
good
part
of
september
have
justified
the
selection
of
montauk
while
prostrations
were
occurring
elsewhere
the
camp
was
cool
and
delightful
most
of
the
time
as
to
the
preparations
it
must
be
remembered
that
the
recall
of
the
whole
army
of
invasion
from
cuba
was
made
in
response
to
a
popular
demand
and
as
a
measure
of
humanity
bring
the
army
home
was
the
call
and
bring
it
at
once
illustration
such
urgency
naturally
leaps
ahead
of
minor
preparations
the
soldiers
wanted
to
come
the
people
wanted
them
to
come
hence
the
crowding
of
transports
and
the
lack
of
comforts
on
the
voyages
hence
the
lack
of
hospital
accommodations
when
the
troops
began
to
arrive
haste
almost
always
brings
about
such
things
but
sometimes
haste
is
imperative
this
was
the
case
in
getting
the
army
out
of
cuba
and
into
camp
at
montauk
in
august
haste
was
pushed
to
that
point
when
omissions
had
to
occur
and
inconvenience
and
suffering
resulted
we
must
also
remember
the
condition
of
the
men
who
came
to
montauk
about
were
reported
as
sick
before
they
left
cuba
but
roughly
speaking
there
were
sick
men
landing
in
montauk
those
who
were
classed
as
well
were
with
rare
exceptions
both
mentally
and
physically
incapable
of
high
effort
it
was
an
invalid
army
with
nearly
of
its
number
seriously
sick
and
suffering
ten
thousand
sick
soldiers
were
never
on
our
hands
before
and
the
mighty
problem
was
not
realized
until
the
transports
began
to
emit
their
streams
of
weakness
and
walking
death
at
montauk
the
preparation
was
altogether
inadequate
for
such
a
mass
of
misery
and
for
a
time
all
appeared
confusion
then
came
severe
cruel
merciless
criticisms
deserved
in
some
cases
no
doubt
but
certainly
not
everywhere
the
faults
gaps
failures
were
everywhere
to
be
seen
and
it
was
easy
to
see
and
to
say
what
ought
to
have
been
done
but
the
situation
at
camp
wikoff
from
august
to
needed
more
than
censure
it
needed
help
the
men
who
were
working
for
the
government
in
both
the
medical
and
commissary
departments
needed
assistance
the
former
in
the
way
of
nurses
and
the
latter
in
the
way
of
appropriate
food
the
censure
and
exposure
indulged
in
by
the
press
may
have
contributed
to
direct
the
attention
of
the
benevolently
disposed
to
the
conditions
in
the
camp
then
came
the
era
of
ample
help
from
massachusetts
from
new
york
in
a
word
from
all
over
the
country
the
merchants
relief
association
poured
in
its
thousands
of
dollars
worth
of
supplies
bringing
them
to
the
camp
and
distributing
them
generously
and
wisely
the
patriotic
relief
the
women
war
relief
the
international
brotherhood
league
and
the
powerful
red
cross
society
all
poured
in
food
and
comforts
for
the
sick
thousands
besides
these
great
organizations
there
were
also
the
spontaneous
offerings
of
the
people
many
of
them
generously
distributed
by
the
brooklyn
daily
active
representatives
the
tent
of
that
journal
was
an
excellent
and
a
veritable
house
of
the
good
shepherd
for
many
a
lost
wanderer
as
well
as
a
place
of
comfort
cheer
and
rest
the
work
done
was
very
valuable
and
highly
appreciated
to
the
medical
department
came
the
trained
hand
of
the
female
nurse
no
one
who
saw
these
sisters
or
the
cheery
cheeked
white
capped
nurses
from
the
schools
could
fail
to
see
that
they
were
in
the
right
place
the
sick
soldier
lot
was
brightened
greatly
when
the
gentle
female
nurse
came
to
his
cot
woman
can
never
be
robbed
of
her
right
to
nurse
this
is
one
of
the
lessons
taught
by

this
vast
army
has
been
handled
no
yellow
fever
has
been
spread
the
general
health
has
been
restored
the
disabled
are
mostly
housed
in
hospitals
and
many
of
them
are
on
the
road
to
recovery
some
have
died
some
are

the

are
repairing
to
their

quite
invigorated
and
greatly
helped
in
many
ways
by
the
kind
treatment
they
have
received
camp
wikoff
was
not
a
failure
but
a
great
and
successful
object
lesson
as
well
as
a
great
summer
school
in
nationalism
here
black
white
and
indian
soldiers
fraternized
here
northerners
and
southerners
served
under
the
same
orders
ten
thousand
soldiers
and
as
many
civilians
daily
attended
the
best
school
of
its
kind
ever
held
in
this
country
striving
to
take
home
to
their
hearts
the
lessons
that
god
is
teaching
the
nations
the
rev
sylvester
malone
thus
sums
up
the
message
of
the
war
to
us
in
his
letter
to
the
committee
to
welcome
brooklyn
soldiers
this
short
war
has
done
so
much
for
america
at
home
and
abroad
that
we
must
take
every
soldier
to
our
warmest
affection
and
send
him
back
to
peaceful
pursuits
on
the
conviction
that
there
is
nothing
higher
in
our
american
life
than
to
have
the
privilege
to
cheer
and
gladden
the
marine
and
the
soldier
that
have
left
to
america
her
brightest
and
best
page
of
a
great
history
this
past
war
must
kindle
in
our
souls
a
love
of
all
the
brethren
black
as
well
as
white
catholic
as
well
as
protestant
having
but
one
language
one
nationality
and
it
is
to
be
hoped
yet
one
religion
these
are
true
words
as
full
of
patriotism
as
they
are
of
fraternity
and
these
are
the
two
special
lessons
taught
at
montauk
a
broad
earnest
practical
fraternity
and
a
love
of
country
before
which
the
petty
prejudices
of
race
and
section
were
compelled
to
yield
ground
the
young
men
christian
association
in
camp
wikoff
the
young
men
christian
association
has
done
an
excellent
work
in
camp
wikoff
their
tents
have
afforded
facilities
for
profitable
amusements
in
the
way
of
quiet
games
thus
bringing
out
the
use
of
these
games
distinct
from
their
abuse
gambling
their
reading
tables
have
also
been
well
supplied
with
papers
and
magazines
religious
and
secular
generally
very
acceptable
to
the
soldiers
as
attested
by
the
numbers
that
read
them
but
perhaps
best
of
all
has
been
the
provision
made
for
the
soldiers
to
write
tables
pens
ink
paper
and
envelopes
have
been
supplied
in
abundance
these
were
of
great
advantage
to
soldiers
living
in
tents
and
the
work
of
the
association
in
this
respect
can
not
be
too
highly
commended
the
specially
religious
work
of
the
association
as
i
have
seen
it
consists
of
three
divisions
first
the
meetings
in
their
tents
held
nightly
and
on
sundays
these
have
been
vigorously
carried
on
and
well
attended
the
chaplains
of
the
camp
often
rendering
assistance
secondly
i
have
noticed
the
men
visiting
the
sick
in
the
hospitals
and
camps
giving
the
word
of
exhortation
and
help
to
the
sick
perhaps
however
in
their
work
of
private
conversation
with
the
well
men
they
have
done
as
much
real
service
for
god
as
in
either
of
the
other
two
fields
they
have
made
the
acquaintance
of
many
men
and
have
won
the
respect
of
the
camp
this
i
have
numbered
as
the
third
division
of
their
work
personal
contact
with
the
soldiers
of
the
camp
at
the
same
time
keeping
themselves
unspotted
from
the
world
b
the
infantry
was
ordered
down
to
siboney
to
do
guard
duty
when
the
regiment
reached
the
hospital
it
was
found
to
be
in
a
deplorable
condition
men
were
dying
there
every
hour
for
the
lack
of
proper
nursing
major
markley
who
had
commanded
the
regiment
since
july
when
colonel
liscum
was
wounded
drew
his
regiment
up
in
line
and
la
garde
in
charge
of
the
hospital
explained
the
needs
of
the
suffering
at
the
same
time
clearly
setting
forth
the
danger
to
men
who
were
not
immune
of
nursing
and
attending
patients
major
markley
then
said
that
any
man
who
wished
to
volunteer
to
nurse
in
the
hospital
could
step
forward
the
whole
regiment
stepped
forward
sixty
men
were
selected
from
the
volunteers
to
nurse
and
within
hours
of
these
brave
fellows
were
down
seriously
ill
with
yellow
or
pernicious
malarial
fever
again
the
regiment
was
drawn
up
in
line
and
again
major
markley
said
that
nurses
were
needed
and
that
any
man
who
wished
to
do
so
could
volunteer
after
the
object
lesson
which
the
men
had
received
in
the
last
few
days
of
the
danger
from
contagion
to
which
they
would
be
exposed
it
was
now
unnecessary
for
la
garde
to
again
warn
the
brave
blacks
of
the
terrible
contagion
when
the
request
for
volunteers
to
replace
those
who
had
already
fallen
in
the
performance
of
their
dangerous
and
perfectly
optional
duty
was
made
again
the
regiment
stepped
forward
as
one
man
when
sent
down
from
the
trenches
the
regiment
consisted
of
eight
companies
averaging
about
forty
men
each
of
the
officers
and
men
who
remained
on
duty
the
forty
days
spent
in
siboney
only
escaped
without
serious
illness
and
of
this
handful
not
a
few
succumbed
to
fevers
on
the
voyage
home
and
after
their
arrival
at
montauk
as
a
result
died
and
about
forty
were
discharged
from
the
regiment
owing
to
disabilities
resulting
from
sickness
which
began
in
the
fight
for
santiago
footnotes
after
the
surrender
dear
chaplain
the
real
trouble
and
difficulties
began
such
a
period
from
july
to
august
was
never
before
known
to
human
beings
i
hope
the
starving
time
was
nothing
to
the
fever
time
where
scores
died
per
day
we
were
not
permitted
to
starve
but
had
fever
and
had
it
bad
beef
both
from
refrigerators
and
from
cans
we
had
plenty
of
fever
but
no
clothing
until
very
late
no
medicine
save
a
little
quinine
which
was
forced
into

was
ordered
to
xenia

on
recruiting
duty
and
on
july
on
seeing
the
reports
of
the
wounded
i
asked
officially
to
be
ordered
to
my
regiment
an
order
to
that
effect
came
about
a
month
later
directing
me
to
join
my
regiment
by
way
of
tampa
florida
arriving
in
tampa
my
destination
was
changed
by

it
is
time
now
to
sum
up
the
work
of
the
four
regiments
whose
careers
we
have
thus
far
followed
and
to
examine
the
grounds
upon
which
the
golden
opinions
they
won
in
battle
and
siege
are
based
we
have
seen
that
in
the
first
fight
that
of
las
guasimas
on
june
the
tenth
cavalry
especially
troops
i
and
b
both
with
their
small
arms
and
with
the
machine
guns
belonging
to
troop
b
did
most
effective
work
against
the
spanish
right
joining
with
the
first
cavalry
in
overcoming
that
force
which
was
rapidly
destroying
roosevelt
rough
riders
nor
should
it
be
forgotten
that
in
this
first
fight
troop
b
which
did
its
full
share
was
commanded
on
the
firing
line
by
sergeants
john
buck
and
james
thompson
in
the
squad
commanded
by
sergeant
thompson
several
men
of
the
first
regular
cavalry
fought
and
it
is
claimed
were
highly
pleased
with
him
as
squad
commander
while
this
was
the
first
fight
of
the
men
of
the
tenth
cavalry
with
the
spaniards
it
was
by
no
means
their
first
experience
under
fire
from
the
time
of
the
organization
of
the
regiment
in
up
to
within
a
year
of
the
war
the
men
had
been
engaged
frequently
in
conflicts
with
indians
and
marauders
often
having
men
killed
and
wounded
in
their
ranks
the
fights
were
participated
in
by
small
numbers
and
the
casualties
were
not
numerous
but
there
were
opportunities
for
the
acquirement
of
skill
and
the
display
of
gallantry
altogether
the
men
of
the
regiment
during
their
experience
on
the
plains
engaged
in
battles
and
skirmishes
this
training
had
transformed
the
older
men
of
the
regiment
into
veterans
and
enabled
them
to
be
cool
and
efficient
in
their
first
fight

the

the
regiment
in
and
had
already
passed
through
eighteen
years
of
the
kind
of
service
above
described
he
was
at
the
time
of
the
cuban
war
in
the
prime
of
life
a
magnificent
horseman
an
experienced
scout
and
a
skilled
packer
in
when
he
joined
the
regiment
the
troops
were
almost
constantly
in
motion

that
one
year
nearly
thousand
miles
his

covering
twelve
hundred

in

sergeant
james

joined
the
regiment
in
and
has
passed
the
ten
years
in
the
one
troop
and
proved
himself
at
las
guasimas
a
soldier
worthy
his
regiment
the
first
battle
gave
the
tenth
a
reputation
in
a
new
field
corresponding
to
that
which
it
had
gained
in
the
west
and
this
was
not
allowed
to
fade
during
its
stay
in
cuba
the
fame
of
this
first
action
spread
rapidly
through
the
army
and
inspired
the
other
regiments
of
colored
men
with
a
desire
to
distinguish
themselves
on
this
new
field
of
honor
and
their
readiness
to
be
to
the
front
and
to
take
prominent
part
in
all
service
was
so
marked
that
opportunity
could
not
be
withheld
from
them
as
the
army
advanced
toward
santiago
these
regiments
became
more
and
more
the
mark
of
observation
by
foreign
military
men
who
were
present
and
by
the
great
throng
of
correspondents
who
were
the
eyes
for
the
people
of
the
civilized
world
and
hence
when
the
lines
of
assault
were
finally
determined
and
the
infantry
and
cavalry
of
our
army
deployed
for
its
perilous
attack
upon
the
spanish
fortifications
the
black
regiments
were
in
their
places
conspicuous
by
their
vigor
and
enthusiasm
in
them
were
enlisted
men
whose
time
of
service
had
expired
a
few
days
before
but
who
had
promptly
in
at
least
two
cases
were
men
who
served
their
full
thirty
years
and
could
have
retired
with
honor
at
the
breaking
out
of
the
war
they
preferred
to
share
the
fortunes
of
their
comrades
in
arms
and
it
is
a
comfort
to
be
able
to
record
that
the
two
spoken
of
came
home
from
the
fight
without
a
wound
and
with
health
unimpaired
how
many
others
there
were
in
the
same
case
in
the
army
is
not
reported
but
the
supposition
is
that
there
were
several
such
in
both
the
white
and
colored
regiments
recalling
the
scenes
of
that
memorable
first
of
july
we
can
see
the
infantry
advancing
steadily
on
the
stone
fort
at
el
caney
at
one
time
entirely
alone
meeting
the
fire
of
the
fort
even
up
to
their
last
rush
forward
captain
loughborough
who
commanded
company
b
of
that
regiment
and
although
his
company
was
in
the
reserve
was
nevertheless
under
fire
says
the
hardest
fighting
of
the
was
between
two
and
four
at
which
time
all
the
other
troops
of
the
attacking
force
except
bates
brigade
were
under
cover
and
remaining
stationary
the
being
the
only
organization
that
was
advancing
the
official
reports
give
the
positions
of
general
chaffee
brigade
during
the
two
hours
between
two
and
four
of
that
afternoon
as
follows
the
seventh
was
under
partial
cover
and
remained
in
its
position
until
about
the
seventeenth
remained
with
its
left
joined
to
the
right
of
the
seventh
until
the
battle
was
over
the
twelfth
infantry
was
in
its
shelter
within
yards
of
the
fort
until
about
ludlow
brigade
was
engaged
with
the
town
hence
only
brigade
consisting
of
the
fourth
and
infantry
was
advancing
upon
the
fort
the
fourth
infantry
was
soon
checked
in
its
advance
as
general
daggett
especially
notes
in
his
report
and
the
was
thus
thrust
forward
alone
excepting
bates
brigade
which
was
making
its
way
up
the
right
this
conspicuous
advance
of
the
brought
that
regiment
into
the
view
of
the
world
and
established
for
it
a
brilliant
reputation
for
skill
and
courage
arriving
in
the
very
jaws
of
the
fort
the
sharpshooters
and
marksmen
of
that
regiment
poured
such
a
deadly
fire
into
the
loopholes
of
the
fort
that
they
actually
silenced
it
with
their
rifles
these
men
with
the
sternness
of
iron
and
the
skill
acquired
by
long
and
careful
training
impressed
their
characteristics
on
the
minds
of
all
their
beholders
of
the
four
hundred
men
who
went
on
the
field
that
morning
very
few
were
recruits
and
many
had
passed
over
ten
years
in
the
service
when
they
took
the
battle
formation
and
advanced
to
the
stone
fort
more
like
veterans
than
troops
who
had
never
been
under
fire
as
their
commander
reports
they
gave
to
the
world
a
striking
exhibition
of
the
effect
of
military
training
in
each
breast
a
spirit
of
bravery
had
been
developed
and
their
skill
in
the
use
of
their
arms
did
not
for
a
moment
forsake
them
they
advanced
against
volleys
from
the
fort
and
rifle
pits
in
front
and
a
galling
fire
from
blockhouses
the
church
tower
and
the
village
on
their
left
before
a
less
severe
fire
than
this
on
that
very
day
a
regiment
of
white
volunteers
had
succumbed
and
was
lying
utterly
demoralized
by
the
roadside
before
this
same
fire
the
second
massachusetts
volunteers
were
forced
to
retire
in
the
face
of
it
the
advanced
steadily
to
its
goal
lieutenant
moss
who
commanded
company
h
on
the
firing
line
on
that
day
has
published
an
account
in
which
he
says
the
town
was
protected
on
the
north
by
three
blockhouses
and
the
church
on
the
west
by
three
blockhouses
and
partially
by
the
church
on
the
east
by
the
stone
fort
one
blockhouse
the
church
and
three
rifle
pits
on
the
south
and
southeast
by
the
stone
fort
three
blockhouses
one
house
the
church
and
eight
rifle
pits
however
the
second
brigade
was
sent
forward
against
the
southeast
of
the
town
thus
being
exposed
to
fire
from
fourteen
sources
nearly
all
of
which
were
in
different
planes
forming
so
many
tiers
of
fire
the
cover
on
the
south
and
southeast
of
the
town
was
no
better
than
if
as
good
as
that
on
the
other
sides
the
cavalry
regiments
were
no
less
conspicuous
in
their
gallantry
at
san
juan
than
was
the
infantry
at
el
caney
the
brilliancy
of
that
remarkable
regiment
the
rough
riders
commanded
on
july
by
colonel
roosevelt
was
so
dazzling
that
it
drew
attention
away
from
the
ordinary
regulars
yet
the
five
regiments
of
regular
cavalry
did
their
duty
as
thoroughly
on
that
day
as
did
the
regiment
of
volunteers
in
this
body
of
cavalry
troops
where
courage
was
elevated
to
a
degree
infringing
upon
the
romantic
the
two
black
regiments
took
their
places
and
were
fit
to
be
associated
in
valor
with
that
highly
representative
regiment
the
turns
aside
from
mere
routine
in
his
report
long
enough
to
say
the
courage
and
conduct
of
the
colored
troops
and
first
united
states
volunteers
seemed
always
up
to
the
best
that
these
black
troopers
held
no
second
place
in
valor
is
proven
by
their
deeds
and
from
the
testimony
of
all
who
observed
their
conduct
and
that
they
with
the
other
regulars
were
decidedly
superior
in
skill
was
recognized
by
the
volunteer
colonel
himself
the
ninth
cavalry
although
suffering
considerably
in
that
advance
on
east
hill
involved
as
it
was
more
or
less
with
roosevelt
regiment
did
not
receive
so
large
a
share
of
public
notice
as
its
sister
regiment
the
strength
of
the
ninth
was
but
little
over
that
of
the
tenth
and
its
movements
were
so
involved
with
those
of
the
volunteers
as
to
be
somewhat
obscured
by
them
the
loss
also
of
its
commander
just
as
the
first
position
of
the
enemy
fell
into
our
hands
was
a
great
misfortune
to
the
regiment
the
ninth
however
was
with
the
first
that
mounted
the
heights
and
whatever
praise
is
to
be
bestowed
upon
the
rough
riders
in
that
assault
is
to
be
distributed
in
equal
degree
to
the
men
of
that
regiment
being
in
the
leading
brigade
of
the
division
this
regiment
had
been
firing
steadily
upon
the
spanish
works
before
the
charge
was
ordered
and
when
the
movement
began
the
men
of
the
ninth
advanced
so
rapidly
that
they
were
among
the
first
to
reach
the
crest
the
tenth
regiment
with
its
hotchkiss
guns
and
its
trained
men
took
its
place
in
the
line
that
morning
to
add
if
possible
further
lustre
to
the
distinction
already
won
in
crossing
the
flat
in
climbing
the
heights
and
in
holding
the
ridge
these
brave
men
did
all
that
could
be
expected
of
them
roosevelt
said
the
colored
troops
did
as
well
as
any
soldiers
could
possibly
do
meaning
the
colored
men
of
the
ninth
and
tenth
cavalry
to
their
officers
he
bestows
a
meed
of
praise
well
deserved
but
not
on
the
peculiar
ground
which
he
brings
forward
he
would
have
the
reader
believe
that
it
has
required
special
ability
and
effort
to
bring
these
colored
men
up
to
the
condition
of
good
soldiers
and
to
induce
them
to
do
so
well
in
battle
while
the
testimony
of
the
officers
themselves
and
the
experience
of
more
than
a
quarter
of
a
century
with
colored
professional
troops
give
no
countenance
to
any
such
theory
the
voice
of
experience
is
that
the
colored
man
is
specially
apt
as
a
soldier
and
general
merritt
declares
him
always
brave
in
battle
the
officers
commanding
colored
troops
at
santiago
honored
themselves
in
their
reports
of
the
battles
by
giving
full
credit
to
the
men
in
the
ranks
who
by
their
resolute
advance
and
their
cool
and
accurate
firing
dislodged
an
intrenched
foe
and
planted
the
flag
of
our
union
where
had
floated
the
ensign
of
spain
that
rushing
line
of
dismounted
cavalry
so
ably
directed
by
sumner
did
not
get
to
its
goal
without
loss
as
it
swept
across
the
open
to
reach
the
heights
it
faced
a
fire
from
the
spanish
works
and
men
dropped
from
the
ranks
wounded
and
dying
of
the
officers
directing
that
advance
fell
either
killed
or
wounded
and
men
these
numbers
appear
small
when
hastily
scanned
or
when
brought
into
comparison
with
the
losses
in
battle
during
the
civil
war
but
if
we
take
time
to
imagine
officers
lying
on
the
ground
either
killed
or
wounded
and
men
in
the
same
condition
the
carnage
will
not
appear
insignificant
woe
enough
followed
even
that
one
short
conflict
it
must
be
observed
also
that
the
whole
strength
of
this
division
was
less
than
men
so
that
about
one
out
of
every
eight
had
been
struck
by
shot
or
shell
several
enlisted
men
among
the
colored
cavalry
displayed
high
soldierly
qualities
in
this
assault
evidencing
a
willingness
to
assume
the
responsibility
of
command
and
the
ability
to
lead
george
berry
became
conspicuous
at
once
by
his
brilliant
achievement
of
carrying
the
colors
of
two
regiments
those
of
his
own
and
of
the
third
cavalry
the
of
the
latter
regiment
had
fallen
and
berry
seized
the
colors
and
bore
them
up
the
hill
with
his
own
the
illustrated
press
gave
some
attention
to
this
exploit
at
the
time
but
no
proper
recognition
of
it
has
as
yet
been
made
sergeant
berry
character
as
a
soldier
had
been
formed
long
before
this
event
and
his
reputation
for
daring
was
already
well
established
he
entered
the
service
in
and
when
he
carried
that
flag
up
san
juan
was
filling
out
his
year
in
the
service
all
this
time
he
had
passed
in
the
cavalry
and
had
engaged
in
many
conflicts
with
hostile
indians
and
ruffians
on
our
frontiers
perhaps
the
most
important
parts
taken
by
any
enlisted
men
in
the
cavalry
division
were
those
taken
by
sergeants
foster
and
givens
the
former
was
first
sergeant
of
troop
g
and
as
the
troop
was
making
its
way
to
the
hill
by
some
means
the
spaniards
were
able
not
only
to
discover
them
but
also
the
direction
in
which
they
were
moving
and
to
determine
their
exact
range
sergeant
foster
ventured
to
tell
the
lieutenant
in
charge
that
the
course
of
advance
should
be
changed
as
they
were
marching
directly
into
the

the
lieutenant
come
on
men
follow
me
all
right
sir
said
the
sergeant
we
go
as
far
as
you
will
the
next
instant
the
lieutenant
was
shot
through
the
head
leaving
sergeant
foster
in
command
immediately
the
troop
was
deployed
out
of
the
dangerous
range
and
the
sergeant
by
the
exercise
of
good
judgment
brought
his
men
to
the
crest
of
the
hill
without
losing
one
from
his
ranks
at
the
time
of
this
action
sergeant
foster
was
a
man
who
would
readily
command
attention
born
in
texas
and
a
soldier
almost
continuously
since
part
of
which
time
had
been
passed
in

had
been
complimented
in

in
consequence
the
of
the
tenth
cavalry
baker
who
served
with
great
credit
during
the
santiago
campaign
is
a
soldier
with
an
excellent
record
he
was
born
of
french
and
american
parentage
in
wyoming
and
enlisted
in
the
ninth
cavalry
as
trumpeter
in
serving
five
years
in
that
regiment
he
then
enlisted
in
the
tenth
cavalry
and
in
became
being
desirous
of
perfecting
himself
in
the
cavalry
service
he
applied
for
an
extended
furlough
with
permission
to
leave
the
country
intending
to
enter
a
cavalry
school
in
france
in
this
desire
he
was
heartily
endorsed
by
the
officers
of
his
regiment
and
was
specially
commended
by
general
miles
who
knew
him
as
a
soldier
and
who
highly
appreciated
him
as
such
the
breaking
out
of
the
spanish
war
soon
after
he
had
made
application
prevented
a
full
consideration
of
his
case
in
baker
published
a
specially
valuable
roster
of
the
officers
of
the
tenth
cavalry
with
some
regimental
reminiscences
which
has
been
of
marked
service
in
the
preparation
of
the
sketches
of
the
enlisted
men
of
his
regiment
he
contributes
the
interesting
sketch
of
his
experiences
in
cuba
with
his
regiment
which
follows
this
chapter
and
which
will
prove
to
many
perhaps
the
most
interesting
portion
of
my
book
the
infantry
advanced
in
that
line
of
attack
on
the
extreme
left
and
reached
the
crest
of
the
san
juan
hills
in
such
numbers
as
to
lead
the
press
correspondents
and
others
to
conclude
that
there
were
more
men
of
this
regiment
promptly
on
the
ground
than
of
any
other
one
regiment
it
is
certain
they
made
a
record
for
heroism
in
that
assault
as
bright
as
any
won
on
the
field
that
day
and
this
record
they
raised
to
a
magnificent
climax
by
their
subsequent
work
in
the
fever
hospital
at
siboney
for
their
distinguished
service
both
in
the
field
and
in
the
hospital
the
colored
ladies
of
new
york
honored
themselves
in
presenting
the
regiment
the
beautiful
stand
of
colors
already
mentioned
as
these
veterans
arrived
at
montauk
they
presented
a
spectacle
well
fitted
to
move
strong
men
to
tears
in
solemn
silence
they
marched
from
on
board
the
transport
nueces
which
had
brought
them
from
cuba
and
noiselessly
they
dragged
their
weary
forms
over
the
sandy
roads
and
up
the
hill
to
the
distant
detention
camp
of
their
number
were
reported
sick
but
the
whole
regiment
was
in
these
were
the
men
who
had
risked
their
lives
and
wrecked
their
health
in
service
for
others
forty
days
they
had
stood
face
to
face
with
death
in
their
soiled
worn
and
faded
clothing
with
arms
uncleaned
emaciated
and
with
scarce
strength
enough
to
make
the
march
before
them
as
they
moved
on
that
hot
of
september
from
the
transport
to
the
camp
they
appeared
more
like
a
funeral
procession
than
heroes
returning
from
the
war
and
to
the
credit
of
our
common
humanity
it
may
be
recorded
that
they
were
greeted
not
with
plaudits
and
cheers
but
with
expressions
of
real
sympathy
many
handkerchiefs
were
brought
into
view
not
to
wave
joyous
welcome
but
to
wipe
away
the
tears
that
came
from
overflowing
hearts
at
no
time
did
human
nature
at
montauk
appear
to
better
advantage
than
in
its
silent
sympathetic
reception
of
the
infantry
of
these
shattered
heroes
general
miles
had
but
recently
spoken
in
words
well
worthy
his
lofty
position
and
noble
manhood
as
a
regiment
of
colored
troops
who
having
shared
equally
in
the
heroism
as
well
as
the
sacrifices
is
now
voluntarily
engaged
in
nursing
yellow
fever
patients
and
burying
the
dead
these
men
came
up
to
montauk
from
great
tribulations
which
should
have
washed
their
robes
to
a
resplendent
whiteness
in
the
eyes
of
the
whole
people
great
we
thank
thee
for
the
glory
thou
hast
given
to
american
soldiery
and
to
the
character
of
the
american
negro
thus
these
four
colored
regiments
took
their
place
on
the
march
in
camp
in
assault
and
in
siege
with
the
flower
of
the
american
army
the
choice
and
pick
of
the
american
nation
and
came
off
acknowledged
as
having
shared
equally
in
heroism
and
sacrifices
with
the
other
regular
regiments
so
engaged
and
deserving
of
special
mention
for
the
exhibition
of
regard
for
the
welfare
of
their
fellow
man
the
query
is
now
pertinent
as
to
the
return
which
has
been
made
to
these
brave
men
the
question
of
ahasuerus
when
told
of
the
valuable
services
of
the
jew
mordecai
is
the
question
which
the
better
nature
of
the
whole
american
people
should
ask
on
hearing
the
general
report
of
the
valuable
services
of
the
negro
regular
in
the
spanish
war
when
ahasuerus
asked
what
honor
and
dignity
hath
been
done
to
mordecai
for
this
his
servants
that
ministered
unto
him
were
compelled
to
answer
there
is
nothing
done
for
him
looking
over
these
four
regiments
at
the
time
of
this
writing
an
answer
somewhat
similar
in
force
must
be
returned
that
the
colored
soldier
is
entitled
to
honor
and
dignity
must
be
admitted
by
all
who
admire
brave
deeds
or
regard
the
welfare
of
the
state
the
colored
soldier
however
was
compelled
to
stand
by
and
see
a
hundred
lieutenancies
filled
in
the
regular
army
many
in
his
own
regiments
only
to
find
himself
overlooked
and
to
be
forced
to
feel
that
his
services
however
valuable
could
not
outweigh
the
demerit
of
his
complexion
the
sum
total
of
permanent
advantage
secured
to
the
colored
regular
as
such
in
that
bloody
ordeal
where
brave
men
gave
up
their
lives
for
their
country
honor
consists
of
a
few
certificates
of
merit
entitling
the
holders
to
two
dollars
per
month
additional
pay
as
long
as
they
remain
in
the
service
nor
is
this
all
or
even
the
worst
of
the
matter
men
who
served
in
the
war
as
first
sergeants
and
who
distinguished
themselves
in
that
capacity
have
been
allowed
to
go
back
to
their
old
companies
to
serve
in
inferior
positions
notably
is
this
the
case
with
sergeant
william
givens
whose
history
has
been
detailed
as
commanding
troop
d
tenth
cavalry
after
captain
bigelow
fell
and
who
heroically
led
the
troop
up
the
hill
he
is
now
serving
in
his
old
troop
as
corporal
his
distinction
having
actually
worked
his
reduction
rather
than
substantial
promotion
it
must
not
be
inferred
from
the
foregoing
however
that
nothing
whatever
was
done
in
recognition
of
the
gallantry
of
the
colored
regulars
something
was
done
cases
of
individual
heroism
were
so
marked
and
so
numerous
that
they
could
not
be
ignored
the
men
who
had
so
distinguished
themselves
could
not
be
disposed
of
by
special
mention
and
compliments
in
orders
something
more
substantial
was
required
fortunately
for
such
purpose
four
regiments
of
colored
united
states
volunteer
infantry
were
then
in
course
of
organization
in
which
the
policy
had
been
established
that
colored
men
should
be
accepted
as
officers
below
the
grade
of
captain
into
these
regiments
the
colored
men
who
had
won
distinction
at
santiago
were
placed
many
as
second
lieutenants
although
some
were
given
first
lieutenancies
this
action
of
the
government
was
hailed
with
great
delight
on
the
part
of
the
colored
americans
generally
and
the
honors
were
accepted
very
gratefully
by
the
soldiers
who
had
won
them
on
the
field
fortunately
as
this
opening
seemed
it
turned
out
very
disappointing
it
soon
became
evident
that
these
regiments
would
be
mustered
out
of
the
service
as
they
had
proven
themselves
no
more
immune
so
far
as
it
could
be
determined
from
the
facts
than
other
troops
the
lieutenants
who
had
been
most
fortunate
in
getting
their
commissions
early
got
about
six
or
seven
months
service
and
then
the
dream
of
their
glory
departed
and
they
fell
back
to
the
ranks
to
stand
attention
to
any
white
man
who
could
muster
political
influence
sufficient
to
secure
a
commission
their
day
was
short
and
when
they
were
discharged
from
the
volunteer
service
there
appeared
no
future
for
them
as
commissioned
officers
their
occupation
was
indeed
gone
it
was
for
them
a
most
disappointing
and
exasperating
promotion
resulting
in
some
cases
in
loss
of
standing
and
in
financial
injury
their
honors
were
too
and
too
circumscribed
to
be
much
more
than
a
lively
tantalization
to
be
remembered
with
disgust
by
those
who
had
worn
them
cruel
indeed
was
the
prejudice
that
could
dictate
such
a
policy
to
the
brave
black
men
of
san
juan
the
black
heroes
however
were
not
without
sympathy
in
their
misfortune
the
good
people
of
the
country
had
still
a
warm
place
in
their
hearts
for
the
colored
soldier
despite
the
sayings
of
his
maligners
the
people
of
washington
had
an
opportunity
to
testify
their
appreciation
of
the
tenth
cavalry
as
that
regiment
passed
through
their
city
on
its
way
to
its
station
in
alabama
and
later
a
portion
of
it
was
called
to
philadelphia
to
take
part
in
the
peace
jubilee
and
no
troops
received
more
generous
attention
to
express
in
some
lasting
form
their
regard
for
the
regiment
and
its
officers
some
patriotic
citizens
of
philadelphia
presented
a
handsome
saber
to
captain
charles
ayres
who
had
charge
of
the
detachment
which
took
part
in
the
peace
jubilee
as
a
token
of
their
appreciation
of
the
splendid
conduct
of
the
regiment
in
the
campaign
of
santiago
and
of
its
superb
soldierly
appearance
and
good
conduct
during
its
attendance
at
the
jubilee
parade
in
philadelphia
likewise
when
the
infantry
arrived
at
its
station
at
fort
logan
colorado
the
people
of
denver
gave
to
both
officers
and
men
a
most
cordial
reception
and
invited
them
at
once
to
take
part
in
their
fall
carnival
all
over
the
country
there
was
at
that
time
an
unusual
degree
of
good
feeling
toward
the
colored
soldier
who
had
fought
so
well
and
no
one
seemed
to
begrudge
him
the
rest
which
came
to
him
or
the
honors
bestowed
upon
him
this
state
of
feeling
did
not
last
before
the
year
closed
assiduous
efforts
were
made
to
poison
the
public
mind
toward
the
black
soldier
and
history
can
but
record
that
these
efforts
were
too
successful
the
three
hundred
colored
officers
became
an
object
at
which
both
prejudice
and
jealousy
could
strike
but
to
reach
them
the
reputation
of
the
entire
colored
contingent
must
be
assailed
this
was
done
with
such
vehemence
and
persistency
that
by
the
opening
of
the
good
name
of
the
black
regular
was
hidden
under
the
rubbish
of
reports
of
misconduct
so
much
had
been
said
and
done
even
in
denver
which
had
poured
out
its
welcome
words
to
the
heroes
of
el
caney
that
the
ministerial
alliance
of
that
city
on
february
found
it
necessary
to
take
up
the
subject
and
that
body
expressed
itself
in
the
unanimous
adoption
of
the
following
resolutions
resolutions
adopted
unanimously
by
the
ministerial
alliance
of
denver
february
by
the
ministerial
alliance
of
the
city
of
denver
that
the
attempt
made
in
certain
quarters
to
have
the
regiment
united
states
infantry
removed
from
fort
logan
appears
to
this
body
to
rest
on
no
just
grounds
to
be
animated
on
the
contrary
by
motives
unworthy
and
discreditable
to
denver
and
the
state
and
that
especially
in
view
of
the
heroic
record
of
the
regiment
its
presence
here
is
an
honor
to
denver
and
colorado
which
this
alliance
would
regret
to
have
withdrawn
the
mustering
out
of
the
volunteers
about
the
time
this
opposition
was
approaching
what
appeared
to
be
a
climax
causing
the
removal
from
the
service
of
the
colored
officers
appeased
the
wrath
of
the
demon
and
the
waves
of
the
storm
gradually
sank
to
a
peace
gratifying
indeed
to
those
who
shuddered
to
see
a
black
man
with
as
the
last
negro
officer
descended
from
the
platform
and
honorably
laid
aside
his
sword
to
take
his
place
as
a
citizen
of
the
republic
or
a
private
in
her
armies
that
class
of
our
citizenship
breathed
a
sigh
of
relief
what
mattered
it
to
them
whether
justice
were
done
whether
the
army
were
weakened
whether
individuals
were
wronged
they
were
relieved
from
seeing
negroes
in
officers
uniforms
and
that
to
them
is
a
most
gracious
portion
the
discharge
of
the
volunteers
was
to
them
the
triumph
of
their
prejudices
and
in
it
they
took
great
comfort
although
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
was
a
plain
national
movement
coming
about
as
a
logical
sequence
entirely
independent
of
their
whims
or
wishes
the
injustice
to
the
negro
officer
does
not
lie
in
his
being
mustered
out
of
the
volunteer
service
but
in
the
failure
to
provide
for
a
recognition
of
his
valor
in
the
nation
permanent
military
establishment
the
departure
of
the
colored
man
from
the
volunteer
service
was
the
consequent
disappearance
of
the
colored
military
officer
with
the
single
exception
of
lieutenant
charles
young
of
the
regular
cavalry
had
a
very
depressing
effect
upon
the
colored
people
at
large
and
called
forth
from
their
press
and
their
associations
most
earnest
protests
with
a
few
exceptions
these
protests
were
encouched
in
respectful
language
toward
the
president
and
his
advisers
but
the
grounds
upon
which
they
were
based
were
so
fair
and
just
that
men
could
not
avoid
their
force
the
following
resolution
passed
by
the
national
council
may
be
taken
as
representative
of
the
best
form
of
such
remonstrance
that
we
are
heartily
grieved
that
the
president
of
the
united
states
and
those
in
authority
have
not
from
time
to
time
used
their
high
station
to
voice
the
best
conscience
of
the
nation
in
regard
to
mob
violence
and
fair
treatment
of
justly
deserving
men
it
is
not
right
that
american
citizens
should
be
despoiled
of
life
and
liberty
while
the
nation
looks
silently
on
or
that
soldiers
who
with
conspicuous
bravery
offer
their
lives
for
the
country
should
have
their
promotion
result
in
practical
dismissal
from
the
army
the
nation
graciously
heeded
the
call
of
justice
and
in
the
of
the
volunteer
army
provided
for
two
colored
regiments
of
which
all
the
company
officers
should
be
colored
men
under
this
arrangement
many
of
the
black
heroes
of
santiago
were
recalled
from
the
ranks
and
again
restored
to
the
positions
they
had
won
thus
did
the
nation
in
part
remedy
the
evil
which
came
in
consequence
of
the
discharge
of
the
volunteers
and
prove
its
willingness
to
do
right
triumphantly
did
the
administration
vindicate
itself
in
the
eyes
of
good
people
and
again
did
it
place
its
withering
disapproval
upon
the
conduct
of
those
who
were
ready
to
shout
their
applause
over
the
worthy
black
officer
accidental
humiliation
the
negro
officer
disappeared
from
the
united
regiments
as
a
lieutenant
only
but
he
returns
to
the
same
or
rather
to
a
higher
grade
of
the
same
form
of
regiments
both
as
lieutenant
and
captain
how
rapid
and
pronounced
has
been
the
evolution
it
is
true
the
negro
officer
is
still
a
volunteer
but
his
standing
is
measurably
improved
both
because
of
the
fact
of
his
recall
and
also
because
the
regiments
which
he
is
now
entering
have
some
prospect
of
being
incorporated
into
the
regular
army
it
does
not
seem
probable
that
the
nation
can
much
longer
postpone
the
increase
of
the
standing
army
and
in
this
increase
it
is
to
be
hoped
the
american
negro
both
as
soldier
and
officer
will
receive
that
full
measure
of
justice
of
which
the
formation
of
the
present
two
colored
regiments
is
so
conspicuous

was
assiduously
devoted
to
organizing

we
were
off
for

where
the
regiment
embarked
on
the
steamship
leona
that
afternoon
june
she
steamed
from
the
dock
when
the
expedition
seemed
to
be
forming
news
was
received
that
the
dreaded
spanish
fleet
was
being
sighted
evidently
lying
in
wait
for
army
transports
so
we
steamed
back
to
the
pier
many
of
the
men
appeared
disappointed
at
the
move
probably
not
realizing
that
there
was
too
much
water
in
the
atlantic
ocean
for
the
army
corps
to
drink
to
my
mind
the
divine
providence
surely
directed
the
move

the

enabled
the

to
be
swelled

thirty
odd
transports

escorted
by

among
them
were

splendid

nothing
unusual
transpiring
though
our
transport
which
also
contained
the
first

had
a
seemingly
close
call
from
being
sent
to
the
bottom
of
the
sea
or
else
being
taken
in
as
a
prisoner
which
the
enemy
could
have
done
with
impunity

going
down

in

the

was
deliberately
stopped
about
midnight

and
left
to
roll
in
the
trough
of
the
sea
until
the
morning
of
the
in
consequence
of
which
we
were
put
hours
behind
the
fleet
and
without
escort
almost
in
sight
of
the
cuban
shores
men
were
indignant
at
having
been
placed
in
such
a
helpless
position
and
would
have
thrown
the
captain
of
the
ship
whom
they
accused
of
being
a
spanish
sympathizer
and
otherwise
disloyal
overboard
without
ceremony
but
for
the
strong
arm
of
military
discipline
we
were
picked
up
by
the
cruiser
bancroft
late
in
the
afternoon
she
having
been
sent
in

of
the
jonah
of

upon

were

cheers
from
all
of

defenders
the
only
explanation
that
i
have
ever
heard
for

unpardonable
blunder
on

alike
lugging

as
though

would
wilt
at
every
step
the
undergrowth
being
so
thick
and
tall
that
scarcely
any

could
get
to
you
on
emerging
from
this
thicket
through
which
we
had
been
marching
for
several
hours
the

could
be
heard
firing
on
the
spanish
batteries
on

other

could
be
seen
crossing

this
revived
the

very
much
as

we
were
met
by

informed
our

that
the

was
engaged
with
the

at

and
that
it
was
hard
pressed
our
pace
was
quickened
the
news
appeared
to
lighten
our
heavy
packs
as
we
toiled
to
the
front
to
assist
our
comrades
the
roar
of
the
artillery
became
plainer
wounded

along
the
road
as
well
as
those
from
the
intense
heat
women
and
children
were
fleeing
to
places
of
safety
our
forces
were
repairing
a
railroad
engine
and
track
also
tearing
up
a
piece
leading
to
a
spanish
blockhouse
in
fact
everything
seemed
to
have
on
an
exceedingly
warlike
tint
but
our
advance
continued
as
swifty
as
our
weary
feet
would
allow
which
soon
brought
us
to
a
number
of
our
own
comrades
conveyed
on
litters
from
la

where
our
advance
guard
was
tussling
hard
with
the
dons
for
the
honors
of
the
day
upon
arrival
of
reinforcements
victory
had
been
wrested
from
the
dons
fairly
by
the

without

every
one
greeted
each
other
as
though
it
had
been
a

instead
of
a
few
hours
since
parting
the
first
cavalry
and
rough
riders
were
unstinted
in
extolling
the
fighting
qualities
of
their
brothers
in
arms
the
tenth
cavalry
the
enemy
was
struck
early
june
entrenched
on
the
heights
of
la
guasima
near
sevilla
on
the
main
road
from
daiquiri
to
the
city
of
santiago
de
cuba
the
advance
guard
was
soon
hotly
engaged
with
them
after
a
very
desperate
fight
of
over
one
hour
the
enemy
was
driven
in
confusion
from
their
intrenchments
our
men
were
too
exhausted
to
follow
them
the
tenth
cavalry
lost
killed
and
wounded
for
a
while
it
was
a
terrific
fight
as
the
enemy
was
strongly
intrenched
on
the
heights
and
our
men
had
to
climb
them
subjected
to
their
fire
which
was
very
accurate
and
much
of
it
doubtless
from
machine
guns
in
hands
of
experienced
men
our
men
had
also
to
contend
with
the
thickest
underbrush
wire
fences
the
famous
military
trochas
and
spanish
daggers
jabbing
them
in
side
at
every
step
for
a
while
the
situation
was
serious
the
decisive
blow
of
the
attack
seems
to
have
been
struck
at
an
opportune
moment
and
the
enemy
withdrew
in
confusion
it
has
been
estimated
that
about
spanish
were
engaged
everything
indicated
that
they
lost
heavily
a
santiago
paper
put
it
at
the
writer
and
the
of
the
first
cavalry
superintended
the
digging
of
one
large
grave
where
all
the
dead
of
the
two
regiments
were
interred
according
to
the
episcopal
service
the
rough
riders
being
farther
to
our
left
buried
their
own
if
advantage
of
position
goes
for
anything
the
spanish
should
have
annihilated
the
americans
as
they
approached
the
stronghold
the
command
remained
on
the
battlefield
until
june
when
it
proceeded
to
sevilla
an
old
coffee
and
sugar
plantation
to
await
the
assembling
of
the
army
and
placing
of
the
artillery
our
camp
at
sevilla
was
an
interesting
one
in
many
ways
it
was
pitched
between
the
main
road
and
a
stream
of
excellent
water
from
the
hill
beyond
the
spanish
works
could
be
viewed
from
the
roadside
many
acquaintances
were
seen
also
generals
foreign
military
attaches
troops
artillery
and
pack
trains
wheeled
transportation
seemed
entirely
out
of
its
place
in
cuba
one
piece
of
artillery
was
noticed
with
horses
tugging
away
at
it
the
cuban
army
cavalry
and
infantry
passed
us
at
this
point
which
seemed
to
consist
of
every
male
capable
of
swelling
the
crowd
those
unable
to
carry
or
secure
guns
had
an
old
knife
or
machete
strapped
to
them
on
june
about
shortly
after
our
daily
shower
which
was
a
little
more
severe
and
much
longer
than
usual
the
regiment
was
put
in
motion
for
the
front
we
had
marched
about
yards
when
the
war
balloon
was
seen
ascending
some
distance
to
our
right
as
the
balloon
question
was
new
every
one
almost
was
stumbling
on
the
man
heels
in
front
trying
to
get
a
peep
at
this
wonderful
war
machine
after
much
vexatious
delay
narrow
road
crowded
with
troops
a
pack
train
came
along
and
added
its
mite
to
the
congestion
as
some
of
the
mules
turned
their
heels
on
the
advancing
column
when
pushed
too
much
we
finally
merged
into
a
beautiful
lawn
site
of
the
division
hospital
where
all
were
as
busy
as
beavers
in
placing
this
indispensable
adjunct
in
order
here
the
work
of
july
was
clearly
suggested
proceeding
wading
and
rewading
streams
we
bivouacked
beyond
the
artillery
on
the
heights
of
el
poso
an
old
sugar
plantation
about
four
miles
off
in
plain
view
of
the
city
of
santiago
the
lights
of
the
city
showed
so
brightly
the
enemy
offering
no
resistance
to
our
advance
i
could
not
help
feeling
apprehensive
of
being
in
a
trap
i
thought
so
seriously
over
the
matter
that
i
did
not
unroll
my
pack
so
as
to
be
ready
at
an
instant
simply
released
my
slicker
put
it
on
and
lay
down
where
i
halted
early
july
all
the
brigade
was
up
getting
breakfast
and
making
as
much
noise
as
if
on
a
practice
march
the
tenth
cavalry
did
not
make
any
fire
until
orders
were
received
to
that
effect
i
remarked
to
my
bunky
that
we
were
not
going
to
fight
evidently
as
the
smoke
would
surely
disclose
our
presence
and
enable
the
enemy
artillery
to
get
our
range
the
whole
of
santiago
seemed
to
be
decorated
with
hospital
flags
at
a
shell
from
capron
battery
artillery
directed
at
a
blockhouse
in
el
caney
announced
that
the
battle
was
on
then
the
musketry
became
general
all
stood
and
watched
the
doomed
village
quite
a
while
as
the
battle
progressed
soon
grices
battery
of
the
artillery
which
was
in
support
belched
forth
destruction
at
the
spanish
works
of
the
city
using
black
powder
the
fire
was
almost
immediately
returned
by
the
enemy
batteries
who
had
smokeless
they
were
shortly
located
when
a
fierce
duel
took
place
the
dons
were
silenced
but
not
until
we
had
suffered
loss
during
this
fire
an
aide
lieut
wm
shipp
tenth
cavalry
brigade
quartermaster
brought
orders
for
us
to
take
position
on
the
left
of
the
first
cavalry
the
line
extended
nearly
north
and
south
on
a
ridge
some
three
or
four
miles
from
the
city
where
the
regiment
was
exposed
to
much
of
the
return
fire
from
the
enemy
batteries
the
men
exhibited
no
special
concern
and
watched
the
flight
of
the
death
messenger
as
eagerly
as
if
at
a
horse
race
adjutant
barnum
here
divided
the
band
and
turned
it
over
to
the
surgeons
to
assist
in
caring
for
the
wounded
and
directed
saddler
sergeant
smith
and
myself
to
accompany
the
colonel
in
advance
when
lieut
shipp
delivered
his
orders
some
of
the
officers
remarked
you
are
having
a
good
time
riding
around
here
he
replied
that
it
was
no
picnic
riding
among
bullets
and
that
he
would
prefer
being
with
his
troops
after
the
artillery
had
ceased
firing
the
regiment
moved
to
the
right
passed
el
poso
where
there
were
additional
signs
of
the
enemy
havoc
among
our
troops
proceeded
down
the
road
leading
to
santiago
the
movement
of
the
regiment
was
delayed
as
it
approached
the
san
juan
river
by
an
infantry
brigade
which
had
halted
the
regiment
came
within
range
of
musket
fire
about
or
mile
from
the
crossing
upon
reaching
the
ford
the
colonel
baldwin
rode
nearly
across
the
stream
closely
followed
by
his
regiment
when
we
were
greeted
by
the
dons
with
a
terrific
volley
of
musketry
soon
followed
by
artillery
which
caused
us
to
realize
more
fully
than
ever
that
things
were
coming
our
way
orders
were
given
to
throw
off
packs
and
get
cover
in
removing
his
sergeant
smith
on
my
immediate
left
was
assisted
by
a
spanish
bullet
and
an
infantry
soldier
fell
as
my
pack
was
thrown
off
to
the
right
in
seeking
cover
men
simply
dropped
to
the
right
and
left
of
the
road
in
a
prone
position
the
regiment
was
here
subjected
to
a
terrific
converging
fire
from
the
blockhouse
and
intrenchments
in
front
and
the
works
further
to
the
left
and
nearer
the
city
the
atmosphere
seemed
perfectly
alive
with
flying
missiles
from
bursting
shells
over
head
and
rifle
bullets
which
seemed
to
have
an
explosive
effect
much
fire
was
probably
drawn
by
the
war
balloon
which
preceded
the
regiment
to
a
point
on
the
edge
of
the
river
near
the
ford
where
it
was
held
this
balloon
undoubtedly
rendered
excellent
service
in
locating
positions
of
the
spanish
works
and
developing
an
ambush
which
had
been
laid
for
us
but
the
poor
balloon
certainly
received
many
uncomplimentary
remarks
during
our
stay
in
its
vicinity
it
seemed
as
though
the
spanish
regarded
the
balloon
as
an
evil
agent
of
some
kind
and
as
though
every
gun
both
great
and
small
was
playing
on
it
i
made
several
trips
under
it
following
the
colonel
who
repeatedly
rode
up
and
down
the
stream
and
i
would
have
been
fully
satisfied
to
have
allowed
my
mind
even
to
wander
back
to
the
gaily
lighted
ball
rooms
and
festivals
left
behind
only
a
few
months
before
while
on
the
last
trip
under
the
balloon
a
large
naval
shell
exploded
knocking
the
colonel
hat
off
crippling
his
horse
and
injuring
the
rider
slightly
in
the
arm
and
side
all
of
course
in
addition
to
a
good
sand
bath
i
then
joined
the
regiment
some
rods
beyond
then
under
cover
in
crouching
down
behind
a
clump
of
brush
heard
some
one
groan
on
looking
around
saw
private
marshall
struggling
in
the
river
wounded
immediately
rushing
to
his
assistance
another
of
those
troublesome
shells
passed
so
close
as
to
cause
me
to
feel
the
heat
it
did
not
stop
the
effort
however
and
the
wounded
man
was
placed
in
safety
the
regiment
remained
in
the
road
only
a
few
moments
when
it
was
ordered
to
take
position
behind
the
river
bank
some
yards
above
the
balloon
for
protection
while
moving
to
that
position
and
while
there
suffered
much
loss
why
we
did
not
lose
heavier
may
be
attributed
to
the
fact
that
the
enemy
musket
fire
was
a
trifle
high
and
their
shells
timed
from
to
one
second
too
long
caused
them
to
explode
beyond
instead
of
in
front
where
the
shells
would
have
certainly
secured
the
dons
maximum
results
as
after
the
balloon
was
cut
down
you
could
scarcely
hold
your
hand
up
without
getting
it
hit
during
the
battle
one
trooper
fell
upon
a
snake
and
crushed
it
to
death
and
another
trooper
allowed
one
of
these
poisonous
reptiles
to
crawl
over
him
while
dodging
a
volley
from
the
spanish
mausers
the
shrapnel
and
canister
shells
with
their
exceedingly
mournful
and
groaning
sound
seemed
to
have
a
more
terrifying
effect
than
the
swift
mauser
bullet
which
always
rendered
the
same
salutation
the
midern
shrapnel
shell
is
better
known
as
the
projectile
and
may
be
regarded
as
the
most
dangerous
of
all
projectiles
designed
for
taking
human
life
it
is
a
shell
filled
with
or
bullets
and
having
a
bursting
charge
which
is
ignited
by
a
time
fuse
only
sufficient
to
break
the
base
and
release
the
bullets
which
then
move
forward
with
the
velocity
it
had
the
time
of
bursting
each
piece
is
capable
of
dealing
death
to
any
living
thing
in
its
path
in
practice
firing
it
is
known
where
by
one
shot
hits
were
made
by
a
single
shrapnel
in
another
hits
are
recorded
imagine
then
the
havoc
of
a
shrapnel
upon
a
group
of
men
such
as
is
here
represented
capron
battery
at
el
caney
cut
down
cavalrymen
with
one
shell
after
a
delay
of
about
minutes
during
part
of
the
time
the
writer
assisted
by
sergeant
smith
and
baldwin
cut
all
the
wire
fences
possible
baldwin
was
dangerously
wounded
while
so
engaged
just
before
the
general
advance
the
regiment
merged
into
open
space
in
plain
view
of
and
under
the
fire
of
the
enemy
and
formed
line
of
battle
facing
toward
the
blockhouses
and
strong
intrenchments
to
the
north
occupied
by
the
spanish
and
advanced
rapidly
in
this
formation
under
a
galling
converging
fire
from
the
enemy
artillery
and
infantry
on
the
blockhouses
and
heavy
intrenchments
to
the
right
front
many
losses
occurred
before
reaching
the
top
of
the
hill
lieut
smith
being
killed
while
gallantly
conducting
his
troop
as
it
arrived
on
the
crest
lieut
shipp
was
killed
about
the
same
instant
shortly
after
leaving
lieutenant
smith
further
to
the
left
and
near
the
pond
on
the
sunken
road
leading
to
santiago
lieutenant
smith
was
struck
in
the
head
and
perished
with
a
single
groan
lieutenant
shipp
was
hit
near
the
heart
death
must
have
been
almost
instantaneous
though
it
appears
he
made
an
effort
to
make
use
of
his
first
aid
package
thus
the
careers
of
two
gallant
and
efficient
officers
whose
lives
had
been
so
closely
associated
were
ended
private
slaughter
who
was
left
in
charge
of
lieutenant
smith
body
was
picked
off
by
the
spanish
sharpshooters
and
private
jackson
lieutenant
shipp
orderly
was
left
as
deaf
as
a
post
from
a
bursting
shell
the
enemy
having
been
driven
back
northwest
to
the
second
and
third
blockhouses
new
lines
were
formed
and
a
rapid
advance
made
upon
them
to
the
new
positions
the
regiment
assisted
in
capturing
these
works
from
the
enemy
and
planted
two
sets
of
colors
on
them
then
took
up
a
position
to
the
north
of
the
second
blockhouse
with
some
changes
in
position
of
troops
this
line
one
of
the
most
advanced
about
three
hundred
yards
of
the
enemy
was
held
and
intrenchments
dug
under
a
very
heavy
and
continuous
fire
from
the
spanish
intrenchments
in
front
july
and
in
their
retreat
from
the
ridge
the
enemy
stood
not
on
the
order
of
their
going
but
fled
in
disorder
like
so
many
sheep
from
the
scene
abandoning
a
quantity
of
ammunition
which
was
fired
at
them
subsequently
from
our
guns
our
men
were
too
exhausted
to
pursue
them
footwear
and
clothing
being
soaked
by
wading
rivers
they
had
become
drenched
with
rain
and
when
they
reached
the
crest
they
were
about
having
fought
about
hours
most
of
which
was
under
that
tropical
sun
throughout
the
night
work
on
the
intrenchments
was
pushed
details
buried
the
dead
improvised
litters
and
conveyed
the
wounded
to
hospitals
all
of
which
was
prosecuted
with
that
vim
for
which
the
regular
soldier
is
characterized
notwithstanding
their
condition
the
regiment
acted
with
extraordinary
coolness
and
bravery
it
held
its
position
at
the
ford
and
moved
forward
unflinchingly
after
deployment
through
the
dense
underbrush
crossed
and
recrossed
by
barbed
wire
under
heavy
and
almost
plunging
fire
from
the
spanish
works
while
attacking
with
small
arms
an
enemy
strongly
posted
in
intrenchments
and
blockhouses
supported
by
artillery
and
who
stubbornly
contested
every
inch
of
ground
gained
by
the
american
troops
officers
were
exceedingly
active
and
tireless
in
their
efforts
to
inspire
and
encourage
the
men
you
could
hear
them
call
out
move
right
along
the
spaniards
ca
shoot
they
are
using
blanks
one
officer
deliberately
stopped
and
lit
his
pipe
amid
a
shower
of
bullets
and
then
moved
on
as
unconcerned
as
if
on
target
practice
the
rifle
pits
occupied
by
the
enemy
were
intrenchments
in
reality
dug
almost
shoulder
deep
and
faced
with
stone
being
constructed
without
approaches
leaving
the
only
avenue
for
escape
over
the
parapet
which
was
equivalent
to
committing
suicide
in
face
of
the
unerring
marksmanship
of
the
united
states
troops
we
were
afterward
told
by
a
spanish
soldier
how
they
were
held
in
these
trenches
by
an
officer
stationed
at
each
end
with
a
club
also
how
they
depended
on
their
officers
for
everything
this
may
account
for
the
large
percentage
of
our
officers
picked
off
by
the
dons
i
observed
during
the
battle
that
when
spotted
by
the
enemy
delivering
orders
or
busying
about
such
duties
as
usually
indicated
some
one
in
authority
the
spanish
would
fire
whole
volleys
at
an
individual
this
evidently
with
a
view
to
demoralizing
the
rank
and
file
by
knocking
off
the
officers
the
spanish
also
tried
an
old
indian
trick
to
draw
our
fire
or
induce
the
men
to
expose
themselves
by
raising
their
hats
on
sticks
or
rifles
or
placing
them
upon
parapets
so
when
we
went
to
fire
they
would
aim
to
catch
us
as
we
rose
with
a
terrific
volley
the
dons
were
however
soon
convinced
of
their
folly
in
this
respect
as
we
always
had
a
volley
for
the
hats
and
a
much
stouter
one
for
the
enemy
as
he
raised
to
reply
to
the
volley
at
the
hats
the
tenth
cavalry
had
fought
indians
too
long
in
the
west
to
be
foiled
in
that
manner
we
were
annoyed
much
by
the
spanish
sharpshooters
stationed
in
tops
of
the
beautiful
palms
and
other
trees
of
dense
foliage
a
number
of
these
guerillas
were
found
provided
with
seats
water
and
other
necessaries
and
i
am
told
some
of
them
had
evidently
robbed
our
dead
to
secure
themselves
an
american
uniform
that
they
might
still
carry
on
their
nefarious
work
undetected
many
of
the
disabled
received
their
second
and
some
their
mortal
wound
while
being
conveyed
from
the
field
by
though
it
was
the
tendency
for
a
time
to
give
the
sharpshooter
story
little
or
no
credence
but
to
lay
the
matter
to
spent
bullets
it
seemed
almost
out
of
the
question
that
spent
bullets
should
annoy
our
division
hospital
some
four
or
five
miles
from
the
spanish
works
it
would
also
seem
equally
as
absurd
that
a
bullet
could
be
trained
to
turn
angles
as
several
of
our
men
were
hit
while
assembled
for
transfer
to
general
hospital
and
receiving
temporary
treatment
at
the
dressing
station
located
in
an
elbow
of
the
san
juan
river
the
division
hospital
was
so
harassed
that
it
was
necessary
to
order
four
troops
of
the
cavalry
there
for
guard
while
en
route
to
the
hospital
on
the
morning
of
july
with
wounded
i
saw
a
squad
of
the
cavalry
after
one
of
these
annoying
angels
not
feet
from
the
road
on
arrival
at
the
hospital
i
was
told
by
a
comrade
that
several
had
been
knocked
from
their
stage
of
action
on
july
our
was
shot
from
a
tree
after
our
line
had
passed
beneath
the
tree
where
he
was
located
july
three
more
fell
in
response
to
a
volley
through
tree
tops
and
on
july
while
waiting
the
hand
to
reach
the
hour
for
the
bombardment
of
the
city
one
of
the
scoundrels
deliberately
ascended
a
tree
in
plain
view
of
and
within
two
hundred
yards
of
our
line
it
was
a
good
thing
that
the
white
flag
for
surrender
appeared
before
the
hour
to
commence
firing
otherwise
spain
would
have
had
at
least
one
less
to
haggle
with
on
account
of
back
pay
to
locate
a
sharpshooter
using
smokeless
powder
among
the
dense
tropical
growth
may
be
compared
with
looking
for
a
needle
in
a
haystack
the
killed
and
wounded
in
battle
present
a
scene
well
calculated
to
move
the
most
callous
men
shot
and
lacerated
in
every
conceivable
manner
some
are
expressionless
some
just
as
they
appeared
in
life
while
others
are
pinched
and
drawn
and
otherwise
distorted
portraying
agony
in
her
most
distressful
state
of
the
wounded
in
their
anguish
some
are
perfectly
quiet
others
are
heard
praying
some
are
calling
for
their
mothers
while
others
are
giving
out
patriotic
utterances
urging
their
comrades
on
to
victory
or
bidding
them
farewell
as
they
pass
on
to
the
front
july
in
passing
a
wounded
comrade
he
told
me
that
he
could
whip
the
cowardly
spaniard
who
shot
him
in
a
fair
fist
fight
during
the
first
day
battle
many
interesting
sights
were
witnessed
the
new
calibre
gatling
guns
were
in
action
these
cruel
machines
were
peppering
away
several
hundred
shots
each
per
minute
and
sweeping
their
front
from
right
to
left
cutting
down
shrubbery
and
spaniards
like
grain
before
the
reaper
i
observed
the
excellent
service
of
the
hotchkiss
mountain
gun
they
certainly
do
their
work
to
perfection
and
well
did
the
dons
know
it
many
shots
fired
into
the
blind
ditches
and
blockhouses
of
the
enemy
caused
them
to
scatter
like
rats
these
guns
use
a
percussion
shell
nearly
two
inches
and
can
be
packed
on
mules
they
were
designed
for
light
service
with
cavalry
on
the
frontier
four
of
these
little
beauties
were
manned
by
men
of
the
tenth
cavalry
the
spanish
made
it
so
hot
for
the
boys
that
they
would
have
to
roll
the
gun
under
cover
to
load
and
then
steal
it
back
to
fire
i
saw
one
of
our
light
batteries
of
artillery
go
in
position
under
fire
at
the
foot
of
san
juan
hill
the
movement
was
swiftly
and
skillfully
executed
a
most
interesting
feature
of
this
was
to
see
the
caissons
drawn
by
six
magnificent
horses
off
for
ammunition
three
drivers
to
each
outfit
one
to
each
pair
of
horses
all
plying
the
whip
at
every
jump
would
remind
you
of
a
roman
chariot
race
coming
around
on
their
last
heat
wheeled
vehicles
of
war
suffer
more
than
other
troops
on
account
of
their
stationary
positions
it
is
here
that
the
dreaded
sharpshooter
comes
in
for
glory
by
picking
off
the
gunners
and
other
individuals
pack
trains
were
seen
dashing
along
the
line
with
that
always
absolutely
essential
ammunition
thereby
gladdening
the
hearts
of
the
boys
who
were
doing
their
utmost
to
expend
every
round
in
their
belts
to
gain
another
foot
of
spanish
territory
during
all
these
stirring
events
the
stomachs
of
the
real
heroes
were
not
neglected
and
most
certainly
not
along
our
part
of
the
line
pack
mules
were
brought
right
up
to
the
line
under
a
hot
fire
loaded
with
sugar
coffee
bacon
and
hardtack
all
of
which
was
in
plenty
some
of
the
mules
were
killed
and
wounded
but
this
did
not
retard
the
advance
of
the
train
when
near
the
firing
line
some
one
called
whose
rations
a
prompt
reply
hungry
soldiers
the
daring
horseman
was
all
that
was
needed
to
make
the
situation
complete
without
participation
of
cavalry
the
ideal
warrior
disappears
from
the
scene
and
the
battle
of
war
is
robbed
of
its
most
attractive
feature
late
in
the
afternoon
july
i
was
directed
to
take
saddler
sergeant
smith
and
bring
to
the
firing
line
all
the
men
i
could
find
of
the
regiment
going
to
the
dressing
station
collected
those
who
had
brought
or
assisted
wounded
there
thence
across
a
portion
of
the
field
passed
over
a
few
hours
previous
men
were
found
almost
exhausted
soaking
wet
or
a
solid
mass
of
mud
resting
as
comfortably
as
if
in
the
finest
of
beds
many
of
them
had
been
on
picket
duty
all
night
before
to
which
was
added
the
hard
day
work
not
then
completed
after
locating
all
i
could
we
went
to
the
crest
of
the
san
juan
hill
to
the
left
of
the
sunken
road
where
the
first
cavalry
was
reforming
and
there
picked
up
a
few
more
who
had
joined
that
regiment
the
tenth
cavalry
having
in
the
meantime
taken
another
position
i
set
out
to
find
it
going
in
front
telling
smith
to
bring
up
the
rear
we
were
detained
a
short
time
near
sunken
roads
by
shells
from
fleet
which
were
falling
in
it
at
a
lively
rate
barbed
wire
prevented
us
from
running
the
gauntlet
shortly
after
crossing
the
road
an
officer
passed
us
his
horse
pushed
to
his
utmost
telling
us
to
take
all
the
ammunition
that
we
possibly
could
on
the
firing
line
about
that
instant
the
pack
train
came
thundering
by
which
we
relieved
of
a
few
thousand
rounds
in
short
order
i
was
much
amused
at
one
of
the
men
who
innocently
asked
where
are
we
to
get
axes
to
burst
these
strong
boxes
the
job
was
speedily
accomplished
before
the
boxes
were
on
the
ground
good
and
most
certainly
in
less
time
than
it
would
have
taken
to
explain
matters
to
the
inexperienced
we
were
soon
off
again
tramping
all
over
the
country
through
darkness
running
into
wire
entanglements
outposts
and
pickets
and
within
fifty
yards
of
the
enemy
subsequently
ascertained
about
found
colonel
roosevelt
a
few
hundred
yards
from
the
spanish
lines
with
some
of
my
regiment
the
first
cavalry
and
rough
riders
at
work
on
trenches
where
we
reported
all
seemed
glad
to
have
my
little
reinforcement
about
men
and
ammunition
i
never
felt
so
relieved
at
anything
as
i
did
to
get
that
herculean
task
off
my
hands
a
job
as
hard
as
working
a
problem
in
the
third
book
of
euclid
the
men
were
so
tired
that
they
would
lie
down
at
every
stop
to
find
the
right
road
or
the
way
out
of
the
wire
entanglements
constantly
encountered
i
have
never
seen
in
a
book
anything
to
equal
the
spanish
wire
entanglements
barbed
wire
was
stretched
in
every
nook
and
corner
through
streams
grass
and
from
two
inches
to
six
feet
in
height
and
from
a
corkscrew
to
a
cable
in
design
it
takes
the
nerve
of
a
circus
man
to
get
men
along
when
they
are
so
exhausted
that
every
place
feels
alike
to
them
and
that
they
would
gladly
give
away
jim
hill
fortune
if
they
possessed
it
for
a
few
sleep
on
arrival
at
the
front
lunch
was
about
over
or
just
ready
lieutenant
anderson
cavalry
gave
me
two
and
hardtacks
from
his
supply
which
he
carried
in
his
bosom
i
was
soon
down
for
a
little
rest
all
desultory
firing
had
ceased
the
pick
and
the
shovel
were
the
only
things
to
disturb
the
quietude
of
that
anxious
night
had
been
down
but
a
short
time
when
aroused
by
one
of
the
rough
riders
who
had
some
rice
and
meat
in
an
ammunition
box
which
he
brought
from
the
captured
blockhouse
the
meat
was
undoubtedly
mule
as
the
longer
i
chewed
it
the
larger
and
more
spongy
it
got
and
were
it
not
for
the
fact
that
i
had
had
some
experience
in
the
same
line
many
years
before
in
mexico
while
in
pursuit
of
hostile
indians
i
would
certainly
have
accused
our
best
friends
rough
riders
of
feeding
us
rubber
i
made
another
effort
for
a
little
sleep
and
was
again
aroused
by
some
one
passing
around
hardtack
raw
bacon
with
instructions
as
to
where
to
go
to
cook
it
i
thanked
him
and
carefully
laid
it
aside
to
resume
my
nap
at
the
pickets
were
having
such
a
lively
set
to
that
i
thought
the
general
engagement
was
on
it
was
at
this
time
i
discovered
that
i
was
shivering
cold
and
that
my
teeth
were
rattling
equal
to
a
telegraph
sounder
so
under
the
circumstances
i
concluded
not
to
try
for
any
more
sleep
the
dew
was
falling
thick
and
heavy
no
coat
no
blanket
top
shirt
torn
in
strips
from
the
brush
and
undershirt
wet
and
in
my
pack
thrown
off
on
coming
into
battle
early
july
the
artillery
took
position
on
our
left
pickets
kept
up
firing
from
until
when
the
engagement
became
general
shortly
after
our
artillery
opened
on
the
spanish
works
who
promptly
returned
the
compliment
during
the
firing
the
dons
exploded
a
shell
in
the
muzzle
of
one
of
our
pieces
adjutant
barnum
fell
at
his
wound
was
promptly
dressed
when
i
started
to
the
division
hospital
with
him
though
seriously
hurt
i
have
never
seen
a
better
natured
man
while
en
route
we
laid
him
down
to
eat
a
can
of
salmon
in
the
in
response
to
his
query
what
up
sergeant
the
salmon
was
passed
him
he
helped
himself
no
further
questions
were
asked
and
the
journey
was
resumed
on
arrival
at
the
hospital
he
was
quickly
examined
and
placed
on
a
comfortable
cot
many
of
the
attendants
were
completely
from
overwork
a
visit
to
a
field
hospital
will
have
a
lasting
place
in
your
memory
every
way
you
turn
amid
the
cries
and
groans
you
get
a
beck
or
call
to
ease
this
or
hand
me
that
and
one
feels
badly
because
of
his
inability
to
extend
them
material
aid
in
their
sufferings
on
returning
to
the
front
i
found
the
regiment
as
hotly
engaged
as
when
i
left
it
some
hours
before
as
the
fighting
was
from
trenches
many
of
our
men
were
wounded
by
shells
sharpshooters
were
on
hand
as
usual
i
was
sent
to
the
captain
of
troop
e
under
the
crest
of
the
hill
with
orders
to
dig
an
approach
to
one
of
the
enemy
trenches
evacuated
the
day
before
also
to
bury
some
of
their
dead
while
delivering
the
order
it
being
necessary
to
get
very
close
on
account
of
the
noise
one
of
those
ever
vigilant
sharpshooters
put
a
bullet
between
our
faces
the
captain
asked
me
to
cut
the
wire
fence
so
his
troops
could
get
through
more
rapidly
while
telling
me
another
bullet
passed
so
close
as
to
disturb
the
captain
mustache
he
took
it
only
remarking
as
he
smiled
pretty
close
firing
ceased
about
after
all
had
had
supper
we
changed
position
further
to
the
right
where
work
on
trenches
was
resumed
about
the
spaniards
made
an
attack
upon
our
lines
and
i
have
never
before
or
since
seen
such
terrific
firing
the
whole
american
line
which
almost
encircled
the
city
was
a
solid
flame
of
fire
the
enemy
artillery
replied
also
their
mausers
but
to
no
avail
they
had
opened
the
ball
but
uncle
boys
did
not
feel
like
yielding
one
inch
of
the
territory
so
dearly
bought
about
midnight
all
hands
were
aroused
by
the
dynamite
cruiser
vesuvius
coughing
for
the
dons
the
roar
was
so
great
that
it
seemed
to
shake
the
whole
island
to
the
uninitiated
it
would
appear
that
some
one
had
taken
a
few
mountains
several
miles
up
in
a
balloon
and
thrown
them
down
july
firing
by
pickets
commenced
very
early
and
quite
heavy
at
terrific
cannonading
to
the
seaward
was
heard
between
and
as
there
was
some
talk
of
the
enemy
making
a
sortie
all
eyes
were
open
dirt
began
falling
in
the
pits
from
the
jar
bells
could
be
heard
tolling
in
the
city
and
steam
whistles
in
the
harbor
there
was
much
speculation
as
to
what
was
in
progress
i
say
that
there
were
many
glad
hearts
when
the
news
reached
us
that
fleet
was
king
of
the
at
all
firing
was
ordered
off
for
flag
of
truce
to
enter
the
spanish
lines
when
the
order
for
cease
firing
was
given
one
of
the
troopers
laid
his
gun
upon
the
parapet
and
remarked
that
he
would
not
take
for
his
experience
but
did
not
want
a
cent
worth
more
work
on
and
breast
works
was
continued
incessantly
until
news
of
the
surrender
reached
us
july
flag
of
truce
all
day
national
and
regimental
colors
placed
on
parapets
at
noon
the
regiment
paraded
and
all
hearts
cheered
by
the
patriotic
telegram
of
the
his
excellency
president
mckinley
refugees
in
droves
could
be
seen
leaving
for
several
days
notice
of
bombardment
having
been
served
on
the
city
july
there
was
much
excitement
when
lieutenant
hobson
and
party
crossed
our
lines
during
truce
the
monotony
was
broken
occasionally
by
the
presence
of
spanish
soldiers
in
quest
of
something
to
eat
or
desiring
to
surrender
truce
was
off
july
at
bombardment
of
the
city
commenced
by
the
army
and
navy
combined
which
continued
until
gatling
dynamite
and
hotchkiss
guns
were
so
well
trained
that
the
dons
scarcely
dared
to
raise
their
heads
and
their
firing
was
soon
silenced
during
the
attack
our
part
of
the
line
suffered
no
loss
while
occupying
these
works
it
was
discovered
that
the
gun
of
the
enemy
that
us
most
was
quite
near
a
large
building
covered
with
red
cross
during
the
truce
all
of
our
dead
were
located
and
buried
it
was
sad
indeed
to
see
the
vultures
swarming
like
flies
when
we
knew
so
well
their
prey
though
prepared
to
several
times
no
shots
were
exchanged
after
july
and
all
was
quiet
until
date
of
capitulation
the
hardest
rain
ever
witnessed
accompanied
by
terrific
thunder
and
lightning
was
on
the
last
day
of
the
engagement
trenches
were
flooded
and
everything
appeared
as
a
sea
july
at
the
regiment
with
the
remainder
of
the
army
was
assembled
over
the
trenches
to
witness
the
formal
surrender
of
general
toral
with
the
spanish
forces
owing
to
the
dense
tropical
growth
and
its
similarity
in
color
to
their
clothing
little
or
nothing
could
be
seen
beyond
the
straw
hats
of
the
dons
as
they
marched
through
the
jungles
at
we
were
again
placed
in
the
same
position
to
salute
old
glory
as
she
ascended
over
the
governor
palace
in
the
city
which
was
told
by
capron
battery
artillery
at
the
first
shot
every
individual
tested
his
lungs
to
their
fullest
capacity
bands
of
music
playing
national
airs
spanish
soldiers
were
soon
over
our
lines
trading
off
swords
wine
cigarettes
and
trinkets
for
hard
tack
and
bacon
this
soon
ended
as
there
were
positive
orders
against
our
fraternizing
the
spaniards
were
a
fine
looking
lot
of
young
men
though
generally
small
in
stature
and
were
very
neat
and
clean
considering
the
officers
were
an
intelligent
and
dignified
looking
set
the
dons
were

even

are
full

and
after

is
the

the

the

are
that

has

it

the

the

that

brought
before
the
country
for
immediate
solution
the
problem
of
garrisoning
that
island
and
in
a
very
short
time
the
question
of
similar
nature
regarding
porto
rico
ten
regiments
of
immunes
had
been
organized
in
the
volunteer
service
partly
in
anticipation
of
such
a
situation
four
of
these
regiments
were
composed
of
colored
enlisted
men
the
regiments
were
classed
as
united
states
volunteer
infantry
and
were
numbered
from
one
to
ten
the
seventh
eighth
ninth
and
tenth
being
colored
of
these
four
colored
regiments
the
officers
above
first
lieutenants
were
white
men
except
the
chaplains
and
in
some
cases
the
surgeons
very
little
care
had
been
taken
in
enlisting
the
men
as
it
was
important
to
get
the
regiments
in
the
field
as
soon
as
possible
yet
of
them
as
a
whole
general
breckinridge
speaks
as
follows
the
colored
regiments
of
immunes
so
called
raised
for
this
war
have
turned
out
so
far
as
can
be
judged
from
their
camp
life
as
none
of
them
have
been
in
any
actual
campaign
very
satisfactory
the
regular
colored
regiments
won
golden
opinions
in
battle
the
experiment
of
having
so
many
colored
officers
has
not
yet
shown
its
full
results
certainly
we
should
have
the
best
obtainable
officers
for
our
volunteers
and
therefore
some
such
men
as
colonel
young
who
is
a
graduate
of
the
military
academy
at
west
point
whether
white
or
black
must
be
sought
for
besides
these
four
colored
regiments
of
immunes
there
were
other
state
organizations
composed
entirely
of
colored
men
mustered
into
the
united
states
service
as
for
example
the
ninth
battalion
of
the
ohio
national
guard
this
organization
was
composed
of
four
companies
with
colored
captains
and
lieutenants
the
staff
officers
also
being
colored
the
commanding
officer
of
the
battalion
being
major
young
who
was
a
first
lieutenant
in
the
regular
army
a
graduate
from
the
military
academy
and
an
officer
of
experience
he
is
the
person
referred
to
as
young
by
general
breckinridge
cited
just
above
this
battalion
although
not
permitted
to
do
any
active
campaigning
maintained
itself
well
in
that
most
trying
of
all
duties
for
raw
troops
camp
duty
winning
a
good
record
in
the
south
as
well
as
in
the
north
having
been
stationed
in
virginia
pennsylvania
and
lastly
in
south
carolina
from
which
latter
place
it
was
mustered
out
and
the
men
proceeded
to
their
homes
in
an
orderly
manner
reflecting
credit
upon
themselves
and
the
officers
under
whom
they
had
served
this
organization
is
mentioned
first
because
it
was
the
only
one
of
its
kind
commanded
by
a
regular
army
officer
and
a
man
who
had
received
scientific
military
training
two
of
these
volunteer
regiments
the
eighth
illinois
and
the
kansas
reached
cuba
and
made
history
there
in
garrison
service
coming
in
direct
contact
with
the
ninth
immunes
and
in
no
sense
suffering
in
comparison
thereto
the
eighth
illinois
being
the
first
to
go
to
the
front
in
a
sense
deserves
to
be
noticed
here
first
this
remarkable
regiment
was
developed
out
of
the
ninth
battalion
illinois
national
guard
and
owes
its
origin
to
the
persistent
efforts
of
john
marshall
robert
jackson
franklin
dennison
wright
rev
ransom
rev
thomas
turner
and
doubtless
many
others
whose
names
do
not
appear
these
gentlemen
named
called
upon
the
governor
of
their
state
the
next
day
after
the
president
had
issued
his
call
for
volunteers
and
received
from
that
official
the
assurance
that
if
another
call
should
be
made
they
should
have
the
opportunity
to
recruit
their
battalion
to
a
regiment
and
that
he
would
call
that
regiment
first
into
the
service
and
that
every
officer
in
that
regiment
will
be
a
colored
man
after
receiving
this
encouragement
the
leaders
began
at
once
the
work
of
organizing
and
recruiting
and
when
the
second
call
came
may
the
regiment
was
well
under
way
and
soon
ready
to
go
into
camp
to
prepare
for
service
on
june
it
assembled
in
springfield
from
the
following
places
seven
hundred
men
from
chicago
one
hundred
and
twenty
from
cairo
a
full
company
from
quincy
and
smaller
numbers
from
mound
city
metropolis
and
litchfield
and
nearly
a
company
from
springfield
the
regiment
was
sworn
in
during
the
latter
half
of
july
the
muster
roll
showing
men
and
officers
every
one
of
whom
was
of
african
descent
except
one
private
in
a
chicago
company
of
these
officers
ten
had
received
college
education
six
were
lawyers
and
the
others
were
educated
in
the
public
schools
or
had
served
in
the
regular
army
as
officers
many
of
them
were
directly
from
illinois
that
is
in
the
sense
of
having
been
born
and
reared
in
the
state
and
were
fully
accustomed
to
the
full
exercise
of
their
rights
as
men
and
citizens
in
character
and
intelligence
the
official
element
of
the
eighth
was
about
up
to
the
standard
of
the
volunteer
army
as
events
subsequently
proved
going
into
camp
with
the
ninth
white
this
latter
regiment
early
in
august
received
an
order
to
move
to
a
southern
camp
en
route
for
cuba
leaving
the
eighth
behind
greatly
to
the
chagrin
of
both
officers
and
men
governor
tanner
was
evidently
disturbed
by
this
move
and
expressed
himself
in
the
following
language
even
from
the
very
doors
of
the
white
house
have
i
received
letters
asking
and
advising
me
not
to
officer
this
regiment
with
colored
men
but
i
promised
to
do
so
and
i
have
done
it
i
shall
never
rest
until
i
see
this
regiment
my
regiment
on
the
soil
of
cuba
battling
for
the
right
and
for
its
kinsmen
later
the
misfortunes
of
the
first
illinois
proved
the
opportunity
of
the
eighth
this
regiment
was
in
cuba
suffering
terribly
with
the
fever
the
men
going
down
under
its
effects
so
rapidly
that
the
colonel
in
command
implored
governor
tanner
to
use
all
influence
at
washington
to
secure
the
immediate
recall
of
the
first
illinois
when
the
governor
received
this
message
he
sent
for
colonel
marshall
of
the
eighth
and
asked
him
to
ascertain
the
sentiments
of
the
officers
and
men
of
his
regiment
in
regard
to
being
sent
to
relieve
the
first
on
the
day
of
august
colonel
marshall
was
able
to
send
to
washington
the
following
dispatch
corbin
i
called
the
officers
of
the
eighth
illinois
colored
in
conference
and
they
are
unanimously
and
enthusiastically
in
favor
of
being
sent
to
relieve
the
first
illinois
at
santiago
to
this
hearty
dispatch
came
the
following
reply
the
secretary
of
war
appreciates
very
much
the
offer
of
the
eighth
illinois
volunteer
infantry
for
duty
in
santiago
and
has
directed
that
the
regiment
be
sent
there
by
steamer
yale
leaving
new
york
next
tuesday
the
main
trouble
with
our
troops
now
in
cuba
is
that
they
are
suffering
from
exhaustion
and
exposure
incident
to
one
of
the
most
trying
campaigns
to
which
soldiers
have
ever
been
subjected
corbin
this
action
on
the
part
of
the
regiment
is
said
to
have
so
pleased
the
president
that
on
hearing
it
he
declared
it
was
the
proudest
moment
of
his
life
on
the
of
august
the
regiment
left
springfield
and
in
passing
through
illinois
and
ohio
was
greeted
with
the
most
generous
enthusiasm
the
people
supplying
the
men
with
free
lunches
at
every
station
this
was
the
period
when
the
sympathy
of
the
whole
country
was
turned
toward
the
colored
soldier
in
consequence
of
the
reports
of
valor
and
heroism
that
had
been
circulated
concerning
the
black
regulars
on
the
afternoon
of
the
the
yale
cast
off
her
lines
and
with
the
first
american
negro
regiment
that
the
world
has
ever
seen
steamed
out
of
new
york
harbor
amid
the
ringing
of
bells
and
shrieks
of
steam
whistles
and
four
days
later
august
landed
in
cuba
the
regiment
remained
in
cuba
until
march
performing
garrison
duty
so
well
that
general
breckenridge
said
it
was
as
fine
a
volunteer
regiment
as
was
ever
mustered
into
the
service
and
that
it
was
a
shame
to
muster
out
of
service
such
an
excellent
regiment
the
kansas
made
up
in
that
state
and
officered
as
was
the
eighth
illinois
by
men
of
the
same
race
with
the
enlisted
men
arrived
in
cuba
august
and
in
company
with
the
eighth
illinois
regiment
was
stationed
in
the
country
about
san
luis
with
headquarters
at
that
place
colonel
marshall
of
the
illinois
regiment
serving
as
commander
of
the
post
and
also
as
governor
of
the
province
of
san
luis
a
detachment
of
the
illinois
regiment
under
command
of
major
jackson
was
sent
to
palma
soriana
and
did
excellent
work
there
in
the
preservation
of
order
between
the
cubans
and
spaniards
who
were
living
together
in
that
place
in
outward
peace
but
in
secret
resentful
hostility
major
jackson
managed
affairs
so
well
that
both
parties
came
to
admire
him
and
when
he
was
called
away
expressed
their
regret
captain
roots
who
commanded
the
post
after
the
departure
of
major
jackson
was
equally
fortunate
especially
with
the
cubans
and
when
it
was
thought
his
command
was
to
be
removed
the
citizens
generally
united
in
a
petition
to
the
general
commanding
asking
that
both
the
captain
and
his
command
might
remain
in
the
city
the
fact
is
also
noted
by
the
chroniclers
of
the
regiment
that
several
marriages
took
place
in
palma
soriana
between
soldiers
of
the
eighth
illinois
and
cuban
maidens
the
eighth
regiment
was
finally
settled
in
san
luis
occupying
the
old
spanish
barracks
and
arsenal
and
under
colonel
marshall
supervision
the
city
was
put
in
fine
sanitary
condition
streets
and
yards
being
carefully
policed
meanwhile
under
the
reign
of
order
and
peace
which
the
colonel
just
methods
established
confidence
prevailed
business
revived
and
the
stagnation
which
had
so
long
hung
like
a
fog
over
the
little
city
departed
and
in
its
stead
came
an
era
of
bustling
activity
all
was
peaceful
and
prosperous
both
with
the
citizens
and
the
garrison
until
the
ninth
united
states
volunteers
came
in
the
vicinity
then
a
difficulty
sprang
up
in
which
both
regiments
became
involved
although
it
was
in
no
sense
serious
but
it
afforded
a
pretext
for
the
removal
of
the
eighth
illinois
from
the
city
the
event
turned
out
all
the
better
for
the
eighth
as
it
enabled
them
to
establish
camp
marshall
about
three
miles
from
the
city
in
a
healthy
neighborhood
where
they
remained
until
ordered
home
to
be
mustered
out
the
regiment
came
back
to
chicago
in
fine
condition
and
was
tendered
an
enthusiastic
welcome
by
that
great
city
thus
two
entire
regiments
represented
the
country
abroad
in
this
its
first
foreign
war
with
a
european
power
it
should
also
be
recorded
that
although
the
ninth
united
states
volunteers
was
composed
of
persons
who
were
classed
as
immune
and
had
come
chiefly
from
louisiana
and
notwithstanding
that
the
officers
of
the
regiment
above
lieutenants
were
white
men
and
the
colonel
an
officer
of
the
regular
army
of
long
experience
and
was
specially
praised
by
so
good
a
sanitarian
as
general
wood
for
having
been
constant
and
untiring
in
his
efforts
to
look
after
the
welfare
of
his
men
and
that
the
surgeons
of
the
regiment
were
white
men
that
deaths
among
the
colored
men
numbered
one
officer
and
enlisted
men
in
striking
contrast
with
this
record
of
the
immune
regiment
is
that
of
the
eighth
illinois
which
was
made
up
entirely
of
residents
of
that
state
and
officered
throughout
by
colored
men
its
medical
officers
were
men
of
high
character
and
its
losses
by
death
were
just
twenty
or
but
little
over
the
number
that
occurred
in
the
immune
regiment
an
efficient
auxiliary
society
to
this
regiment
was
formed
of
colored
ladies
of
chicago
who
forwarded
to
the
sick
in
cuba
more
than
six
hundred
dollars
worth
of
well
chosen
supplies
which
did
much
for
the
comfort
of
those
in
the
hospital
but
this
would
not
account
for
the
great
difference
in
the
death
rate
of
the
two
regiments
though
not
immune
the
eighth
illinois
fared
very
much
better
than
the
immune
regiment
although
the
latter
had
the
benefit
of
white
officers
the
experience
of
the
kansas
did
not
differ
in
any
important
respect
from
that
of
the
eighth
illinois
both
regiments
returned
to
their
homes
in
march
and
were
mustered
out
of
the
service
leaving
behind
them
good
records
for
efficiency
the
sixth
virginia
regiment
consisted
of
eight
companies
and
was
under
command
of
richard
croxton
of
the
regular
army
white
with
majors
johnson
and
johnson
colored
it
was
mustered
into
service
during
the
latter
part
of
the
summer
and
went
into
camp
near
knoxville
tennessee
here
an
order
came
from
corps
headquarters
at
lexington
kentucky
directing
that
nine
of
the
officers
including
one
major
should
appear
before
a
board
of
examiners
in
order
to
give
evidence
of
their
fitness
to
command
the
officers
named
regarding
this
as
uncalled
for
immediately
tendered
their
resignations
the
vacancies
thus
created
were
filled
by
the
governor
of
the
state
the
appointees
being
white
men
these
white
officers
on
arriving
at
the
camp
and
finding
themselves
unwelcome
immediately
followed
in
the
wake
of
their
colored
predecessors
and
tendered
their
resignations
the
difficulties
arising
from
this
friction
were
somehow
adjusted
but
in
what
manner
the
reports
available
at
this
time
do
not
show
moving
to
macon
georgia
the
regiment
remained
in
the
service
until
some
time
in
the
winter
when
it
was
mustered
out
much
was
said
by
the
local
papers
to
the
detriment
of
the
men
composing
this
regiment
but
viewing
their
action
from
the
standpoint
of
the
civilian
and
citizen
it
does
not
appear
reprehensible
they
had
volunteered
with
the
understanding
that
their
own
officers
officers
with
whom
they
were
well
acquainted
and
in
whose
friendship
they
held
a
place
should
command
them
and
when
they
saw
these
officers
displaced
and
white
strangers
put
in
their
stead
they
felt
a
pardonable
indignation
and
took
their
own
way
of
expressing
it
as
soldiers
their
conduct
in
resisting
authority
can
not
be
commended
the
third
north
carolina
volunteer
infantry
was
organized
as
were
the
regiments
of
illinois
and
kansas
above
described
the
officers
of
the
north
carolina
regiment
were
all
colored
men
of
that
state
and
were
men
of
character
and
note
its
commanding
officer
colonel
young
had
held
responsible
positions
under
both
state
and
national
governments
had
been
editor
of
a
paper
and
member
of
the
state
legislature
and
major
in
the
state
militia
in
character
he
was
above
reproach
being
a
strict
teetotaler
and
not
even
using
tobacco
the
regiment
made
a
good
record
but
did
not
see
any
active
service
a
peculiar
regiment
was
organized
in
alabama
known
as
the
third
alabama
volunteer
infantry
in
which
the
enlisted
men
were
all
colored
and
the
officers
all
white
the
regiment
saw
no
service
and
attracted
no
attention
outside
of
its
immediate
locality
two
companies
of
colored
men
with
colored
captains
were
also
mustered
into
the
united
states
service
from
indiana
and
finally
attached
to
colonel
huggins
command
although
not
becoming
a
part
of
his
regiment
the
eighth
immunes
they
were
stationed
at
fort
thomas
and
at
chickamauga
and
were
mustered
out
early
their
officers
were
men
of
intelligence
who
had
acquired
experience
by
several
service
in
the
militia
and
the
companies
were
exceptionally
well
drilled
they
were
designated
companies
a
and
b
and
were
commanded
by
captains
porter
and
buckner
with
lieutenant
thomas
as
quartermaster
the
organization
of
the
four
immune
regiments
already
mentioned
gave
opportunity
for
colored
men
to
obtain
commissions
as
lieutenants
a
few
of
these
positions
were
seized
upon
by
influential
young
white
men
who
held
them
but
with
no
intention
of
ever
serving
in
the
regiments
as
they
found
staff
positions
much
more
congenial
to
their
tastes
the
colored
men
who
were
appointed
lieutenants
in
these
regiments
were
generally
either
young
men
of
ability
and
influence
who
had
assisted
in
getting
up
their
companies
and
who
in
many
cases
had
received
some
elementary
military
instruction
as
cadets
in
school
or
men
who
had
distinguished
themselves
by
efficiency
or
gallantry
in
the
regular
army
some
exceptions
there
were
of
course
and
a
few
received
commissions
in
consequence
of
personal
friendship
and
political
considerations
before
these
regiments
were
mustered
out
of
the
service
about
of
the
lieutenants
were
men
from
the
regular
army
i
am
sure
the
reader
will
be
pleased
to
learn
that
sergeants
foster
buck
and
givens
whose
deeds
in
cuba
have
already
been
related
were
rewarded
with
commissions
and
that
the
gallant
thomas
butler
who
rushed
forward
from
his
company
line
and
seized
the
spanish
standard
at
el
caney
was
afterward
permitted
to
serve
in
cuba
with
the
rank
of
a
commissioned
officer
besides
those
named
above
there
were
others
also
of
marked
ability
and
very
respectable
attainments
who
received
commissions
on
general
merit
as
well
as
for
gallantry
chief
among
the
class
promoted
for
efficiency
was
first
lieutenant
james
gillespie
formerly
post
gillespie
had
served
several
years
in
the
tenth
cavalry
and
had
proved
himself
an
excellent
soldier
both
in
horsemanship
and
as
marksman
he
was
up
to
the
standard
while
his
character
and
business
qualifications
were
such
as
to
secure
for
him
a
staff
position
of
responsibility
as
he
held
positions
of
important
posts
and
filled
them
with
great
satisfaction
because
of
his
efficiency
as
a
soldier
he
was
given
a
commission
as
first
lieutenant
and
executed
the
duties
of
his
office
with
the
same
ability
that
had
marked
his
career
as
an
enlisted
man
from
the
tenth
cavalry
also
came
first
lieutenant
baker
whose
commission
was
a
tribute
to
his
fidelity
and
efficiency
a
soldier
of
high
type
he
bore
his
commission
and
its
honors
as
worthily
as
any
son
of
our
republic
in
the
same
category
must
be
placed
first
lieutenant
wm
mcbryer
formerly
sergeant
in
the
infantry
mcbryer
had
served
in
the
tenth
cavalry
and
had
won
a
medal
of
honor
in
conflict
with
the
indians
he
was
a
soldier
distinguished
by
strength
of
character
prompt
executiveness
quick
decision
and
courage
he
was
also
possessed
of
considerable
literary
skill
was
a
good
speaker
and
attractive
writer
and
a
man
of
fine
parts
he
was
a
valuable
acquisition
to
the
volunteer
service
and
would
have
made
a
fine
captain
of
the
colored
sergeants
from
the
regular
army
who
were
given
commissions
in
the
volunteer
service
it
would
not
be
extravagant
to
say
that
all
were
men
of
worth
in
the
service
and
there
was
scarcely
one
of
them
but
could
have
successfully
commanded
a
company
lieutenant
smith
formerly
first
sergeant
in
the
infantry
was
so
well
informed
in
the
paper
work
of
the
army
and
in
company
administration
particularly
that
he
was
regarded
as
an
authority
and
he
was
so
well
experienced
in
the
whole
life
of
a
soldier
in
camp
field
garrison
and
in
battle
that
it
would
have
been
difficult
to
find
his
superior
in
the
army
to
the
credit
of
all
of
the
enlisted
men
of
the
regular
army
referred
to
who
received
commissions
in
the
volunteer
service
all
served
honorably
and
were
mustered
out
without
bringing
any
scandal
of
any
sort
upon
the
service
the
colored
volunteers
in
the
service
acquitted
themselves
as
well
as
the
average
volunteer
and
when
mustered
out
proceeded
to
their
homes
about
as
others
did
the
treatment
accorded
them
in
some
of
the
southern
cities
especially
in
nashville
tennessee
did
not
speak
well
for
the
loyalty
of
that
section
nor
was
it
such
as
might
reasonably
be
expected
from
a
people
who
had
fared
so
well
in
the
offices
and
honors
of
the
short
war
from
the
best
sources
available
it
seems
incumbent
to
say
that
the
many
charges
alleged
against
the
colored
volunteers
for
excessive
rioting
and
disorder
were
without
proper
foundation
and
the
assaults
made
upon
them
unjustifiable
and
cruel
the
spirit
of
the
assailants
is
best
seen
from
a
description
of
the
attack
made
upon
the
unarmed
discharged
soldiers
of
the
eighth
immuners
in
nashville
already
alluded
to
this
description
was
made
by
the
sheriff
who
participated
in
the
brutality
an
officer
who
was
on
the
train
and
who
was
asleep
at
the
time
when
aroused
went
into
the
car
where
the
men
were
and
found
that
they
had
been
beaten
and
robbed
and
in
some
instances
their
discharges
taken
from
them
and
torn
up
and
their
weapons
and
money
taken
from
them
by
citizens
it
was
about
one
and
the
men
were
generally
asleep
when
attacked
the
sheriff
gloats
over
it
in
language
which
ought
not
be
allowed
to
disappear
it
was
the
best
piece
of
work
i
ever
witnessed
the
police
went
to
the
depot
not
armed
with
the
regulation
but
carrying
stout
hickory
clubs
about
two
and
feet
long
their
idea
was
that
a
mahogany
or
lignum
vitae
billy
was
too
costly
a
weapon
to
be
broken
over
a
negro
head
the
police
were
on
board
the
train
before
it
stopped
even
and
the
way
they
went
for
the
negroes
was
inspiring
the
police
tolerated
no
impudence
much
less
rowdyism
from
the
negroes
and
if
a
darky
even
looked
mad
it
was
enough
for
some
policeman
to
bend
his
club
double
over
his
head
in
fact
after
the
police
finished
with
them
they
were
the
meekest
mildest
most
polite
set
of
colored
men
i
ever
saw
this
language
is
respectfully
dedicated
to
the
memory
of
the
proud
city
of
nashville
and
presents
to
the
readers
the
portrait
of
her
police
despite
this
vile
treatment
the
colored
soldier
went
on
to
his
home
ready
again
to
respond
to
his
country
call
and
to
rally
to
the
defence
of
his
country
flag
and
incidentally
to
the
preservation
of
the
lives
and
homes
of
the
misguided
heartless
beings
who
can
delight
in
his
sufferings
the
hickory
club
belongs
to
one
sort
of
warrior
the
rifle
to
quite
another
the
club
and
rifle
represent
different
grades
of
civilization
the
negro
has
left
the
club
the
language
from
nashville
does
honor
to
the
club
billy
and
bully
are
the
theme
of
this
officer
of
the
law
and
for
a
darkey
even
to
look
mad
is
ample
justification
for
some
policeman
to
bend
his
club
double
over
his
head

these
policemen

the

it
must
be
said
that
the

by
their

although
negroes
fought
in

in

the

and
the

of
there
is
no
instance
of
any
negro
attaining
or
exercising
the
rank
of
commissioned

it
is
a
curious
bit
of
history
however
that
in
the
civil
war
those
who
were
fighting
to
keep
colored
men
enslaved
were
the
first
to
commission
colored
officers
in
louisiana
but
a
few
days
after
the
outbreak
of
the
war
the
free
colored
population
of
new
orleans
organized
a
military
organization
called
the
native
guard
which
was
accepted
into
the
service
of
the
state
and
its
officers
were
duly
commissioned
by
the
governor
these
negro
soldiers
were
the
first
to
welcome
general
butler
when
he
entered
new
orleans
and
the
fact
of
the
organization
of
the
native
guard
by
the
confederates
was
used
by
general
butler
as
the
basis
for
the
organization
of
three
colored
regiments
of
native
guards
all
the
line
officers
of
which
were
colored
men

some
colored
soldiers
known
as
guards
before
the
arrival
of
the
federal
soldiers
but
i
do
not
know
much
about
them
it
was
a
knowledge
of
this
fact
that
induced
general
butler
then
in

of
the
department
of
the
gulf
to
organize
three

on

at

an
associated

despatch
announced
that
the

was

the
feature
of
the

however
was
one

fourteen
hundred
free

another
grand

followed
the
next

a

also
pay
a
deserved
compliment
to
the

all
very
well
drilled

most
of
these

quite
unaided
by

themselves
with

without

on

its
designation
went
through
the
same
changes
as
the
others
at
the
same
dates
and
it
was
mustered
out
november
as
the
colored
infantry
soon
after
the
organization
of
the
third
regiment
trouble
for
the
colored
officers
began
and
the
department
began
a
systematic
effort
to
get
rid
of
them
a
board
of
examiners
was
appointed
and
all
colored
officers
of
the
third
regiment
were
ordered
before
it
they
refused
to
obey
the
order
and
tendered
their
resignations
in
a
body
the
resignations
were
accepted
and
that
was
the
beginning
of
the
end
like
action
with
the
same
results
followed
in
the
first
and
second
regiments
and
colored
officers
were
soon
seen
no
more
all
were
driven
out
of
the
service
except
three
or
four
who
were
never
ordered
to
appear
before
the
examining
board
among
these
was
your
humble
servant
i
was
then
captain
of
company
a
second
regiment
but
i
soon
tired
of
my
isolation
and
resigned
later
on
in
the
war
with
the
general
enlistment
of
colored
soldiers
a
number
of
colored
chaplains
and
some
surgeons
were
commissioned
towards
the
close
of
the
war
several
colored
line
officers
and
a
field
officer
or
two
were
appointed
the
state
of
massachusetts
was
foremost
in
according
this
recognition
to
colored
soldiers
but
these
later
appointments
came
in
most
cases
after
the
fighting
was
all
over
and
gave
few
opportunities
to
command
at
the
close
of
the
war
with
the
muster
out
of
troops
the
colored
officers
disappeared
and
upon
the
reorganization
of
the
army
despite
the
brilliant
record
of
the
colored
soldiers
no
negro
was
given
a
commission
of
any
sort
the
outbreak
of
the
spanish
war
brought
the
question
of
colored
officers
prominently
to
the
front
the
colored
people
began
at
once
to
demand
that
officers
of
their
own
race
be
commissioned
to
command
colored
volunteers
they
were
not
to
be
deluded
by
any
extravagant
praise
of
their
past
heroic
services
which
veiled
a
determination
to
ignore
their
just
claims
so
firmly
did
they
adhere
to
their
demands
that
but
one
volunteer
regiment
of
colored
troops
the
third
alabama
could
be
induced
to
enter
the
service
with
none
of
its
officers
colored
but
the
concessions
obtained
were
always
at
the
expense
of
continuous
and
persistent
effort
and
in
the
teeth
of
a
very
active
and
at
times
extremely
violent
opposition
we
know
already
the
kind
of
opposition
the
eighth
illinois
the
kansas
and
the
third
north
carolina
regiments
officered
entirely
by
colored
men
encountered
it
was
this
opposition
as
we
have
seen
which
confined
colored
officers
to
positions
below
the
grade
of
captain
in
the
four
immune
regiments
from
a
like
cause
we
know
also
distinguished
officers
of
the
four
regular
regiments
of
colored
troops
were
allowed
promotion
only
to
lieutenantcies
in
the
immune
regiments
and
upon
the
muster
out
of
those
organizations
were
compelled
if
they
desired
to
continue
soldiering
to
resume
their
places
as
enlisted
men
there
is
some
explanation
for
this
opposition
in
the
nature
of
the
distinction
which
military
rank
confers
military
rank
and
naval
rank
constitute
the
only
real
distinction
among
us
our
officers
of
the
army
and
navy
and
of
the
army
more
than
of
the
navy
because
the
former
officers
are
more
constantly
within
the
country
make
up
the
sole
separate
class
of
our
population
we
have
no
established
nobility
wealth
confers
no
privilege
which
men
are
bound
to
observe
the
respect
paid
to
men
who
attain
eminence
in
science
and
learning
goes
only
as
far
as
they
are
known
the
titles
of
the
professions
are
matters
of
courtesy
and
customs
only
our
judges
and
legislators
our
governors
and
mayors
are
still
our
fellow
citizens
and
the
dignity
they
enjoy
is
but
an
honorary
one
the
highest
office
within
our
gift
offers
no
exception
at
the
close
of
his
term
even
an
that
melancholy
product
of
our
system
must
resume
his
place
among
his
fellow
citizens
to
sink
not
infrequently
into
obscurity
but
fifty
thousand
soldiers
must
stand
attention
to
the
merest
second
lieutenant
his
rank
is
a
the
life
tenure
the
necessities
of
military
discipline
and
administration
weld
army
officers
into
a
distinct
class
and
make
our
military
system
the
sole
but
necessary
relic
of
personal
government
any
class
with
special
privileges
is
necessarily
conservative
the
intimate
association
of
officer
and
gentleman
a
legacy
of
feudal
days
is
not
without
significance
an
officer
must
also
be
a
gentleman
and
conduct
unbecoming
an
officer
and
a
gentleman
is
erected
into
an
offence
punishable
by
dismissal
from
the
service
the
word
gentleman
has
got
far
away
from
the
strict
significance
of
its
french
parent
de
tocqueville
has
made
us
see
the
process
of
this
development
passing
over
to
england
with
the
changing
conditions
gentleman
was
used
to
describe
persons
lower
and
lower
in
the
social
scale
until
when
it
crossed
to
this
country
its
significance
became
lost
in
an
indiscriminate
application
to
all
citizens
a
flavor
of
its
caste
significance
still
remains
in
the
traditional
high
sense
of
honor
characteristic
of
our
military
service
it
was
a
distant
step
for
a
slave
and
freedman
to
become
an
officer
and
gentleman
while
the
above
reflections
may
be
some
explanations
for
the
opposition
to
the
commissioning
of
negroes
there
was
no
one
with
hardihood
enough
to
bring
them
forward
such
notions
might
form
the
groundwork
of
a
prejudice
but
they
could
not
become
the
reason
of
a
policy
it
is
an
instinctive
tribute
to
the
good
sense
of
the
american
people
that
the
opponents
of
colored
officers
were
compelled
to
find
reasons
of
another
kind
for
their
antagonism
the
one
formula
heard
always
in
the
campaign
against
colored
officers
was
negroes
can
not
command
this
formula
was
sent
forth
with
every
kind
of
variation
from
the
fierce
fulminations
of
the
hostile
southern
press
to
the
more
apologetic
and
philosophical
discussions
of
our
northern
secular
and
religious
journals
to
be
sure
every
now
and
then
there
were
exhibitions
of
impatience
against
the
doctrine
not
a
few
newspapers
had
little
tolerance
for
the
nonsense
some
former
commanders
of
negro
soldiers
in
the
civil
war
notably
general
morgan
spoke
out
in
their
behalf
the
brilliant
career
of
the
black
regulars
in
cuba
broke
the
spell
for
a
time
but
the
speedily
set
in
in
short
it
became
fastened
pretty
completely
in
the
popular
mind
as
a
bit
of
demonstrated
truth
that
negroes
could
not
make
officers
that
colored
soldiers
would
neither
follow
nor
obey
officers
of
their
own
race
this
formula
had
of
course
to
ignore
an
entire
epoch
of
history
it
could
take
no
account
of
that
lurid
program
wrought
in
the
antilles
a
century
ago
a
rising
mob
of
rebel
slaves
transformed
into
an
invincible
army
of
tumultuous
blacks
under
the
guidance
of
the
immortal
toussaint
overcoming
the
trained
armies
of
three
continental
powers
spain
england
and
france
and
audaciously
projecting
a
black
republic
into
the
family
of
nations
a
program
at
once
a
marvel
and
a
terror
to
the
civilized
world
not
alone
in
hayti
but
throughout
the
states
of
central
and
south
america
have
negroes
exercised
military
command
both
in
the
struggles
of
these
states
for
independence
and
in
their
national
armies
established
after
independence
at
least
one
soldier
of
negro
blood
general
dumas
father
of
the
great
novelist
arose
to
the
rank
of
general
of
division
in
the
french
army
and
served
under
napoleon
in
our
day
we
have
seen
general
dodds
another
soldier
of
negro
blood
returning
from
a
successful
campaign
in
africa
acclaimed
throughout
france
his
immense
popularity
threatening
paris
with
a
renewal
of
the
hysterical
days
of
boulanger
finally
we
need
not
be
told
that
at
the
very
head
and
front
of
the
cuban
rebellion
were
negroes
of
every
hue
exercising
every
kind
of
command
up
to
the
very
highest
we
need
but
recall
the
lamented
maceo
the
negro
chieftain
whose
tragic
end
brought
sorrow
and
dismay
to
all
of
cuba
with
an
army
thronging
with
blacks
and
mulattoes
these
cuban
chieftains
black
mulatto
and
white
prolonged
such
an
harassing
warfare
as
to
compel
the
intervention
of
the
united
states
at
the
end
of
this
recital
which
could
well
have
been
extended
with
greater
particularity
if
it
were
thought
needful
we
are
bound
to
conclude
that
the
arbitrary
formula
relied
upon
by
the
opponents
of
colored
officers
was
never
constructed
to
fit
such
an
obstinate
set
of
facts
the
prolonged
struggle
which
culminated
in
permitting
the
general
enlistment
in
our
civil
war
had
only
to
be
repeated
to
secure
for
him
the
full
pay
of
a
soldier
the
right
to
be
treated
as
a
prisoner
of
war
and
to
relieve
him
of
the
monopoly
of
fatigue
and
garrison
duty
he
was
too
overjoyed
with
the
boon
of
fighting
for
the
liberation
of
his
race
to
make
much
contention
about
who
was
to
lead
him
with
meagre
exception
his
exclusive
business
in
that
war
was
to
carry
a

organized
late
in

also
and
had
entire
charge
of
the
prisoners
and
of
the
daily
policing
of
the
camp
he
is
a
man
of
distinguished
appearance
and
in
old
times
was
the
crack
coachman
of
beaufort
they
tell
me
that
he
was
once
allowed
to
present
a
petition
to
the
governor
of
south
carolina
in
behalf
of
slaves
for
the
redress
of
certain
grievances

that
a
placard
offering
two
thousand
dollars
for
his
is
still
to
be
seen
by
the
wayside
between
here
and
charleston
he
was
a
sergeant
in
the
old
regiment
and
was
taken
by
general
hunter
to
new
york
last
spring
where
the
chevrons
on
his
arm
brought
a
mob
upon
him
in
broadway
whom
he
kept
off
till
the
police
interfered
there
is
not
a
white
officer
in
this
regiment
who
has
more
administrative
ability
or
more
absolute
authority
over
the
men
they
do
not
love
him
but
his
mere
presence
has
controlling
power
over
them
he
writes
well
enough
to
prepare
for
me
a
daily
report
of
his
duties
in
the
camp
if
his
education
reached
a
higher
point
i
see
no
reason
why
he
should
not
command
the
army
of
the
potomac
he
is
or
rather
i
should
say
his
complexion
like
that
of
others
of
my
darkest
men
having
a
sort
of
rich
clear
depth
without
a
trace
of
sootiness
and
to
my
eye
very
handsome
his
features
are
tolerably
regular
and
full
of
command
and
his
figure
superior
to
that
of
any
of
our
white
officers
being
six
feet
high
perfectly
proportioned
and
of
apparently
inexhaustable
strength
and
activity
his
gait
is
like
a
panther
i
never
saw
such
a
tread
no
novel
has
described
a
man
of
such
marked
ability
he
makes
toussaint
perfectly
intelligible
and
if
there
should
ever
be
a
black
monarchy
in
south
carolina
he
will
be
its
king
excepting
the
louisiana
native
guards
the
first
south
carolina
volunteers
was
the
first
regiment
of
colored
troops
to
be
mustered
into
the
service
in
the
civil
war
the
regiment
was
made
up
entirely
of
slaves
with
scarcely
a
mulatto
among
them
the
first
day
of
freedom
for
these
men
was
passed
in
uniform
and
with
a
gun
among
these
negroes
just
wrested
from
slavery
their
scholarly
commander
colonel
higginson
could
find
many
whom
he
judged
well
fitted
by
nature
to
command
afterwards
i
had
excellent
battalion
drills
he
writes
without
a
single
white
officer
by
way
of
experiment
putting
each
company
under
a
sergeant
and
going
through
the
most
difficult
movements
such
as
division
columns
and
oblique
squares
and
as
to
actual
discipline
it
is
doing
no
injustice
to
the
of
the
regiment
to
say
that
none
of
them
received
from
the
men
more
implicit
obedience
than
rivers
it
always
seemed
to
me
an
insult
to
those
brave
men
to
have
novices
put
over
their
heads
on
the
ground
of
color
alone
and
the
men
felt
it
the
more
keenly
as
they
remained
longer
in
the
service
there
were
more
than
seven
hundred
enlisted
men
in
the
regiment
when
mustered
out
after
more
than
three
years
service
the
ranks
had
been
kept
full
by
enlistment
but
there
were
only
fourteen
instead
of
the
full
thirty
the
men
who
should
have
filled
these
vacancies
were
doing
duty
as
sergeants
in
the
ranks
numerous
expeditions
were
constantly
on
foot
in
the
department
of
the
south
having
for
their
object
the
liberation
of
slaves
still
held
to
service
in
neighborhoods
remote
from
the
union
camps
or
to
capture
supplies
and
munitions
of
war
frequently
these
expeditions
came
in
conflict
with
armed
bodies
of
rebels
and
hot
engagements
would
ensue
resulting
in
considerable
loss
of
life
colored
soldiers
were
particularly
serviceable
for
this
work
because
of
their
intimate
knowledge
of
the
country
and
their
zeal
for
the
rescue
of
their
enslaved
brethren
one
of
these
expeditions
composed
of
thirty
colored
soldiers
and

commanded

left
jacksonville

early
in

they
destroyed
considerable
property
in
the
use
of
the
rebel
government
burned
the
bridge
across
the
oclawaha
river
and
started
on
their
return
with
negroes
whom
they
had
rescued
from
slavery
four
white
prisoners
some
wagons
and
a
large
number
of
horses
and
mules
they
were
attacked
by
a
rebel
band
of
more
than
fifty
cavalry
the
colored
soldiers
commanded
by
one
of
their
own
number
defeated
and
drove
off
the
rebels
inflicting
upon
them
the
heavy
loss
of
thirty
men
after
a
long
and
rapid
march
they
arrived
at
augustine
florida
with
a
loss
of
but
two
killed
and
four
wounded
the
expedition
covering
in
all
five
days
these
colored
soldiers
and
their
colored
commander
were
thanked
in
orders
by
gilmore
commanding
the
department
who
was
moved
to
declare
that
this
expedition
planned
and
executed
by
colored
men
under
the
command
of
a
colored
officer
reflects
credit
upon
the
brave
participants
and
their
leader
and
he
holds
up
their
conduct
to
their
comrades
in
arms
as
an
example
worthy
of
emulation
it
was
no
uncommon
occurrence
throughout
the
civil
war
for
colored
officers
to
be
thrown
into
command
of
their
companies
by
the
killing
or
wounding
of
their
superior
officers
on
many
a
field
of
battle
this
happened
and
these
colored
officers
showed
the
same
ability
to
take
the
initiative
and
accept
the
responsibility
and
conducted
their
commands
just
as
bravely
and
unfalteringly
as
did
their
successors
on
the
firing
line
at
la
guasima
and
el
caney
or
in
the
charge
up
san
juan
hill
in
the
battle
of
new
market
heights
fought
on
the
of
september
as
part
of
a
comprehensive
effort
to
turn
lee
left
flank
the
great
heroism
of
the
black
soldiers
and
the
terrible
slaughter
among
them
impressed
their
commander
the
late
butler
to
his
dying
day
and
made
him
the
stout
champion
of
their
rights
for
the
rest
of
his
life

as
commissioned

they
commanded

and
in

showing
marked
efficiency
and
conspicuous
gallantry
the
colored
officers
of
the
first

regiments
of
louisiana
native
guards
whose
history
has
been
detailed
earlier
in
this
chapter
were
retained
in
the
service
long
enough
to
command
their
troops
in
bloody
combat
with
the
enemy
it
will
be
remembered
that
of
the
second

of
louisiana
native

only
the
colonel
and
were
white
the
major

all
the

engaged
and
repulsed
a
considerable
body
of
rebel
infantry
and
cavalry
at
pascagoula
mississippi
the
engagement
lasted
from
until
and
was
remarkable
for
the
steadiness
tenacity
and
bravery
of
these
black
troops
in
this
their
first
battle
where
they
succeeded
in
defeating
and
beating
off
an
enemy
five
times
their
number
the
official
report
by
the
colonel
commanding
declared
great
credit
is
due
to
the
troops
engaged
for
their
unflinching
bravery
and
steadiness
under
this
their
first
fire
exchanging
volley
after
volley
with
the
coolness
of
veterans
and
for
their
determined
tenacity
in
maintaining
their
position
and
taking
advantage
of
every
success
that
their
courage
and
valor
gave
them
and
also
to
their
officers
who
were
cool
and
determined
throughout
the
action
fighting
their
commands
against
five
times
their
number
and
confident
throughout
of
success
i
would
particularly
call
the
attention
of
the
department
to
major
dumas
capt
villeverd
and
lieuts
jones
and
martin
who
were
constantly
in
the
thickest
of
the
fight
and
by
their
unflinching
bravery
and
admirable
handling
of
their
commands
contributed
to
the
success
of
the
attack
and
reflected
great
honor
upon
the
flag
for
which
they
so
nobly
struggled
the
battle
which
settled
for
all
time
the
bravery
of
black
troops
and
ought
as
well
to
silence
all
question
about
the
capacity
of
colored
officers
was
the
storming
of
port
hudson
may
for
months
the
confederates
had
had
uninterrupted
opportunity
to
strengthen
their
works
at
port
hudson
at
a
time
when
an
abundance
of
slave
labor
was
at
their
disposal
they
had
constructed
defenses
of
remarkable
strength
on
a
bluff
eighty
feet
above
the
river
was
a
series
of
batteries
mounting
in
all
twenty
siege
guns
for
land
defenses
they
had
a
continuous
line
of
parapet
of
strong
profile
beginning
at
a
point
on
the
river
a
mile
from
port
hudson
and
extending
in
a
for
three
or
four
miles
over
a
country
for
the
most
part
rough
and
broken
and
ending
again
at
the
river
a
half
mile
north
of
port
hudson
at
appropriate
positions
along
this
line
four
bastion
works
were
constructed
and
thirty
pieces
of
field
artillery
were
posted
the
average
thickness
of
the
parapet
was
twenty
feet
and
the
depth
of
the
ditch
below
the
top
of
the
parapet
was
fifteen
feet

in
the
morning
for

reason
the

until
late
in
the
afternoon
six
companies
of
the
first
louisiana
and
nine
companies
of
the
third
in
all
men
were
formed
in
column
of
attack
even
now
one
can
not
contemplate
unmoved
the
desperate
valor
of
these
black
troops
and
the
terrible
slaughter
among
them
as
they
were
sent
to
their
impossible
task
that
day
in

moving
forward
in
double
quick
time
the
column
emerged
from
the
woods
and
passing
over
the
plain
strewn
with
felled
trees
and
entangled
brushwood
plunged
into
a
fury
of
shot
and
shell
as
they
charged
for
the
batteries
on
the
rebel
left
again
and
again
that
unsupported
column
of
black
troops
held
to
their
hopeless
mission
by
the
unrelenting
order
of
the
brigade

hurled
itself
literally
into
the
jaws
of
death

meeting
horrible
destruction
actually

it
was
a
day
prodigal
with
deeds

fanatical
bravery

and
shivered
in
that
fearful
hail
of
fire
were
still
borne
forward
in

of
the
works
by
the
until
a
shell
from
the
enemy
cut
the
flag
in
two
and
gave
the
sergeant
his
mortal
wound
he
fell
spattering
the
flag
with
blood
and
brains
and
hugged
it
to
his
bosom
as
he
lay
in
the
grasp
of
death
two
corporals
sprang
forward
to
seize
the

rivalry

to

also
by

burned
with

with

work
of
black

under
black

a

forever
of
the
military
glory
of
the

are

yet
dare
to
declare
that

not

glowingly
their

the

of
the
black

conquered

won
for

forthwith
before

with
the
purpose
of
driving
them
from

and
every
one
of

in
was
made
to
resign
in

manner
was
their
bravery
rewarded
in
the
four
regiments
of

made
a

of

regular
army
since
the
civil
war
colored
soldiers
to
say
nothing
of
the
three
colored
graduates
from
west
point
referred
to
earlier
in
this
chapter
have
repeatedly
given
evidence
of
their
capacity
to
command
an
earlier
chapter
has
already
set
forth
the
gallant
manner
in
which
colored
officers
left
in
command
by
the
killing
or
wounding
of
their
officers
commanded
their
companies
at
la
guasima
el
caney
and
in
the
charge
at
san
juan
on
numerous
occasions
with
none
of
the
heroic
setting
of
the
santiago
campaign
have
colored
soldiers
time
and
again
command
detachments
and
companies
on
dangerous
scouting
expeditions
and
in
skirmishes
and
fights
with
hostile
indians
and
marauders
the
entire
western
country
is
a
witness
of
their
prowess
this
meritorious
work
done
in
remote
regions
has
seldom
come
to
public
notice
the
medal
which
the
soldier
wears
and
the
official
entry
in
company
and
regimental
record
are
in
most
cases
the
sole
chronicle
a
typical
instance
is
furnished
in
the
career
of
sergeant
richard
anderson
late
of
the
ninth
cavalry
the
sergeant
has
long
ago
completed
his
thirty
years
of
service
he
passed
through
all
grades
in
his
troop
and
regiment
and
was
retired
as
post
the
story
of
the
engagements
in
which
he
commanded
give
ample
proof
of
his
ability
and
bravery
it
would
be
no
service
to
the
sergeant
to
disturb
his
own
frank
and
formal
narrative

lasted

hours

were
killed
and
several

we
had
no
men
killed
but
a
few
wounded
in

l
and
b
troops
we
followed
the
indians
many
miles
that
evening
but
having
no
rations
returned
to
fort
cumming
late
that
evening
and
went
into
camp
until
the
following
morning
when
the
two
troops
took
the
trail
and
followed
it
many
days
but
being
unable
to
overtake
the
indians
returned
to
fort
cumming
in
august
while
my
troop
was
in
camp
at
fort
cumming
new
mexico
awaiting
orders
for
another
campaign
against
these
same
apache
indians
my
troop
commander
having
been
ordered
to
fort
bayard
new
mexico
on
general
duty
and
during
his
absence
having
no
commissioned
officer
available
i
was
in
command
of
my
troop
subject
to
the
orders
of
the
post
commander
at
at
night
august
while
in
my
tent
asleep
the
commanding
orderly
knocked
on
my
tent
and
informed
me
that
the
commanding
officer
wanted
me
to
report
to
him
at
once
i
asked
the
orderly
what
was
up
he
informed
me
that
he
supposed
a
scout
was
going
out
as
the
commanding
officer
had
sent
for
lieutenant
smith
then
in
command
of
troop
h
cavalry
i
dressed
myself
promptly
and
reported
and
found
lieutenant
smith
and
the
commanding
officer
at
the
office
on
my
arrival
the
commanding
officer
asked
me
about
how
many
men
i
could
mount
for
thirty
days
detached
duty
leaving
so
many
men
to
take
care
of
property
and
horses
i
told
him
about
how
many
he
ordered
me
to
make
a
ration
return
for
that
number
of
men
and
send
a
sergeant
to
draw
rations
for
thirty
scout
and
for
me
to
hurry
up
and
when
ready
to
report
to
lieutenant
smith
by
my
troop
was
ready
and
mounted
and
reported
as
ordered
and
at
troop
b
and
h
pulled
out
from
fort
cumming
for
lake
valley
new
mexico
and
when
the
sun
showed
himself
over
the
tops
of
the
mountains
we
marched
down
the
mountains
into
lake
valley
miles
from
fort
cumming
we
went
into
camp
hoping
to
spend
a
few
hours
and
take
a
rest
and
feed
our
horses
and
men
about
a
small
boy
came
running
through
camp
crying
as
if
to
break
his
heart
saying
that
the
indians
had
killed
his
mother
and
their
baby
some
of
the
men
said
the
boy
must
be
crazy
but
many
of
them
made
for
their
horses
without
orders
soon
lieutenant
smith
ordered
saddle
up
in
less
than
five
minutes
all
the
command
was
saddled
up
and
ready
to
mount
we
mounted
and
pulled
out
at
a
gallop
and
continued
at
that
gait
until
we
came
to
a
high
mountain
when
we
came
down
to
a
walk
and
when
over
the
mountain
we
took
up
the
gallop
and
from
that
time
on
nothing
but
a
gallop
and
a
trot
when
the
country
was
favorable
for
such
when
we
had
marched
about
two
miles
from
lake
valley
we
met
the
father
of
the
boy
with
his
leg
bleeding
where
the
indians
had
shot
him
we
marched
about
half
a
mile
farther
when
we
could
see
the
indians
leaving
this
man
ranch
we
had
a
running
fight
with
them
from
that
time
until
about
that
evening
august
having
no
rations
we
returned
to
lake
valley
with
the
intention
of
resting
that
night
and
taking
the
trail
the
next
morning
but
about
that
night
a
ranchman
came
into
camp
and
reported
that
the
indians
had
marched
into
a
milk
ranch
and
burned
up
the
ranch
and
had
gone
into
camp
near
by
lieutenant
smith
ordered
me
to
have
the
command
in
readiness
to
march
at
sharp
and
said
we
could
surprise
those
indians
and
capture
many
of
them
and
kill
a
few
also
i
went
and
made
my
detail
as
ordered
with
five
rations
in
haversacks
and
at
reported
as
ordered
about
the
command
pulled
out
and
marched
within
about
a
mile
and
a
half
of
the
milk
ranch
and
went
into
camp
and
at
daylight
in
the
morning
saddled
up
and
marched
to
the
ranch
the
indians
had
pulled
out
a
few
minutes
before
our
arrival
we
took
their
trail
and
came
up
with
them
about
finding
the
indians
in
ambush
lieutenant
smith
was
the
first
man
killed
and
when
i
heard
his
last
command
which
was
dismount
then
the
whole
command
fell
upon
your
humble
servant
we
fell
back
up
a
canon
and
on
a
hill
and
held
them
until
when
a
reinforcement
came
up
of
about
twenty
men
from
lake
valey
and
the
indians
pulled
off
over
the
mountains
the
men
were
killed
in
the
engagement
lieutenant

and
william

after
the
indians
ceased
firing
and
fell
back
over
the
mountains
i
cared
for
the
wounded
and
sent
lieutenant
smith
body
to
fort
bayard
new
mexico
where
his
wife
was
which
was
about
sixty
miles
from
the
and
daily
body
to
lake
valley
all
under
a
strong
detachment
of
men
under
a
officer
when
i
marched
with
the
remainder
of
the
command
with
the
dead
and
wounded
for
rodman
mill
where
i
arrived
about
on
the
morning
of
august
and
buried
the
dead
and
sent
the
wounded
to
fort
bayard
one
thing
that
attracted
my
attention
more
than
anything
else
was
the
suffering
of
private
john
williams
troop
h
who
was
shot
through
the
kneecap
and
had
to
ride
all
that
night
from
the
to
brookman
mill
poor
fellow
i
buried
all
my
dead
and
then
marched
for
fort
cumming
where
we
arrived
about
sunset
and
reported
to
general
edward
hatch
then
commanding
the
regiment
and
also
the
district
of
new
mexico
giving
him
all
the
details
pertaining
to
the
engagement
general
hatch
asked
me
about
how
many
men
i
could
mount
the
next
morning
the
i
informed
him
about
how
many
he
ordered
me
to
have
my
troop
in
readiness
by
daylight
and
report
to
lieutenant
demmick
then
commanding
troop
l
and
follow
that
indian
trail
my
troop
was
ready
as
ordered
and
marched
we
followed
those
indians
to
the
line
of
old
mexico
but
were
unable
to
overtake
them
such
was
my
last
engagement
with
hostile
indians
the
formula
that
negroes
can
not
command
with
the
further
assertion
that
colored
soldiers
will
neither
follow
nor
obey
officers
of
their
own
race
we
have
now
taken
out
of
the
heads
of
its
upholders
and
away
from
its
secure
setting
of
type
on
the
printed
page
and
applied
it
to
the
facts
negro
soldiers
have
shown
their
ability
to
command
by
commanding
not
always
with
to
be
sure
but
nevertheless
commanding
with
wearying
succession
instance
after
instance
where
negroes
have
exercised
all
manner
of
military
command
and
always
creditably
have
extended
for
us
a
recital
to
the
border
of
monotony
and
made
formidable
test
of
our
patience
in
france
and
the
west
indies
in
central
and
south
america
negroes
have
commanded
armies
in
one
instance
fighting
under
napoleon
at
other
times
to
free
themselves
from
slavery
and
their
countries
from
the
yoke
of
oppression
in
our
own
country
from
the
days
of
the
revolution
when
fourteen
american
officers
declared
in
a
memorial
to
the
congress
that
a
negro
man
called
salem
poor
of
colonel
frye
regiment
captain
ames
company
in
the
late
battle
at
charlestown
behaved
like
an
as
well
as
an
excellent
soldier
from
the
first
war
of
the
nation
down
to
its
last
negro
soldiers
have
been
evincing
their
capacity
to
command
in
the
civil
war
where
thousands
of
colored
soldiers
fought
for
the
union
their
ability
to
command
has
been
evidenced
in
a
hundred
ways
on
scouts
and
expeditions
in
camp
and
in
battle
on
two
notable
occasions
negro
officers
gallantly
fought
their
commands
side
by
side
with
white
officers
and
added
lustre
to
the
military
glory
of
the
nation
upon
the
of
the
regular
army
at
the
close
of
the
war
the
theatre
shifted
to
our
western
frontier
where
the
negro
soldier
continued
to
display
his
ability
to
command
finally
in
the
spanish
war
just
closed
the
negro
soldier
made
the
nation
again
bear
witness
not
alone
to
his
undaunted
bravery
but
also
to
his
conspicuous
capacity
to
command
out
of
this
abundant
and
conclusive
array
of
incontestable
facts
frankly
is
there
anything
left
to
the
arbitrary
formula
that
negroes
can
not
command
but
a
string
of
ipse
dixits
hung
on
a
very
old
but
still
decidedly
robust
prejudice
there
is
no
escape
from
the
conclusion
that
as
a
matter
of
fact
with
opportunity
negroes
differ
in
no
wise
from
other
men
in
capacity
to
exercise
military
command
undoubtedly
substantial
progress
has
been
made
respecting
colored
officers
since
when
colored
soldiers
were
first
admitted
in
considerable
numbers
into
the
army
of
the
union
at
the
period
of
the
civil
war
colored
officers
for
colored
soldiers
was
little
more
than
thought
of
the
sole
instance
comprised
the
colored
officers
of
the
three
regiments
of
louisiana
native
guards
and
the
sporadic
appointments
made
near
the
close
of
the
war
when
the
fighting
was
over
more
than
three
hundred
colored
officers
served
in
the
volunteer
army
in
the
war
with
spain
two
northern
states
illinois
and
kansas
and
one
southern
state
north
carolina
put
each
in
the
field
as
part
of
its
quota
a
regiment
of
colored
troops
officered
throughout
by
colored
men
ohio
and
indiana
contributed
each
a
separate
battalion
of
colored
soldiers
entirely
under
colored
officers
in
a
regiment
of
colored
troops
with
colored
officers
was
practically
impossible
in
a
regiment
of
colored
volunteers
without
some
colored
officers
was
almost
equally
impossible
in
a
regiment
of
colored
soldiers
commanded
by
colored
officers
would
have
been
a
violation
of
the
sentiment
of
the
period
and
an
outrage
upon
popular
feelings
the
appearance
of
which
in
almost
any
northern
city
would
hardly
fail
to
provoke
an
angry
and
resentful
mob
at
that
period
even
black
recruits
in
uniforms
were
frequently
assaulted
in
the
streets
of
northern
cities
we
have
seen
already
how
sergeant
rivers
of
the
first
south
carolina
volunteers
had
to
beat
off
a
mob
on
broadway
in
new
york
city
in
regiments
and
battalions
of
colored
troops
with
colored
colonels
and
majors
in
command
came
out
of
states
where
the
most
stringent
black
laws
were
formerly
in
force
and
were
greeted
with
applause
as
they
passed
on
their
way
to
their
camps
or
to
embark
for
cuba
in
baltimore
in
the
appearance
of
a
negro
in
the
uniform
of
an
army
surgeon
started
a
riot
and
the
irate
mob
was
not
appeased
until
it
had
stripped
the
patriotic
colored
doctor
of
his
in
when
the
sixth
regiment
of
massachusetts
volunteers
passed
through
the
same
city
the
colored
officers
of
company
l
of
that
regiment
were
welcomed
with
the
same
courtesies
as
their
white
colleagues
courtesies
extended
as
a
memorial
of
the
fateful
progress
of
the
regiment
through
the
city
of
baltimore
in
one
state
which
went
to
war
in
to
keep
the
negro
a
slave
put
in
the
field
a
regiment
of
colored
soldiers
officered
by
colored
men
from
the
colonel
down
to
this
extent
has
prejudice
been
made
to
yield
either
to
political
necessity
or
a
generous
change
in
sentiment
thus
were
found
states
both
north
and
south
willing
to
give
the
negro
the
full
military
recognition
to
which
he
is
entitled
with
this
wider
recognition
of
colored
officers
the
general
government
has
not
kept
pace
in
the
four
regiments
of
colored
volunteers
recruited
by
the
general
government
for
service
in
the
war
with
spain
only
the
lieutenants
were
colored
through
the
extreme
conservatism
of
the
war
department
in
these
regiments
no
colored
officers
no
matter
how
meritorious
could
be
appointed
or
advanced
to
the
grade
of
captain
such
was
the
announced
policy
of
the
department
and
it
was
strictly
carried
out
the
commissioning
of
this
large
number
of
colored
men
even
to
lieutenancies
was
without
doubt
a
distinct
step
in
advance
it
was
an
entering
wedge
but
it
was
also
an
advance
singularly
inadequate
and
embarrassing
in
one
of
these
colored
volunteer
commonly
called
immune
regiments
of
the
twelve
captains
but
five
had
previous
military
training
while
of
the
colored
lieutenants
eighteen
had
previous
military
experience
and
three
of
the
remaining
six
were
promoted
from
the
ranks
so
that
at
the
time
of
their
appointment
lieutenants
had
previous
military
training
of
the
five
captains
with
previous
military
experience
one
years
ago
had
been
a
lieutenant
in
the
regular
army
another
was
promoted
from
post
a
third
at
one
time
had
been
first
sergeant
of
artillery
the
remaining
two
had
more
or
less
experience
in
the
militia
of
the
eighteen
lieutenants
with
previous
military
experience
twelve
had
served
in
the
regular
army
eight
of
these
not
one
with
a
service
less
than
fifteen
years
were
promoted
directly
from

ranks
of

regulars
for
efficiency
and
gallantry
at
the
time
of
their
promotion
two
were
sergeants
five
first
sergeants
and
one
a
post
the
four
others
from
the
regular
army
had
served
five
years
each
of
the
six
remaining
lieutenants
with
previous
military
experience
four
had
received
military
training
in
high
schools
three
of
whom
were
subsequently
officers
in
the
militia
fifth
graduated
from
a
state
college
with
a
military
department
the
sixth
had
been
for
years
an
officer
in
the
militia
with
this
advantage
at
the
start
it
is
no
extravagance
to
say
that
the
colored
officers
practically
made
the
companies
to
them
was
due
the
greater
part
of
the
credit
for
whatever
efficiency
the
companies
showed
moreover
these
colored
officers
were
not
behind
in
intelligence
among
them
were
four
graduates
of
universities
and
colleges
two
lawyers
two
teachers
one
journalist
five
graduates
of
high
schools
and
academies
and
the
men
from
the
regular
army
as
their
previous
rank
indicates
were
of
good
average
intelligence
there
is
no
reason
to
believe
that
this
one
of
the
four
colored
volunteer
regiments
was
in
any
degree
exceptional
these
are
the
officers
for
whom
the
war
department
had
erected
their
arbitrary
bar
at
captaincy
and
declared
that
no
show
of
efficiency
could
secure
for
them
the
titular
rank
which
they
more
than
once
actually
exercised
for
they
were
repeatedly
in
command
of
their
companies
through
sickness
or
absence
of
their
captains
they
served
as
officers
without
the
incentive
which
comes
from
hope
of
promotion
they
were
forced
to
see
the
credit
of
their
labors
go
to
others
and
to
share
more
than
once
in
discredit
for
which
they
were
not
responsible
they
were
and
in
this
lay
their
chief
embarrassment
without
the
security
and
protection
which
higher
rank
would
have
accorded
them
in
case
of
trial
by
captains
and
other
higher
officers
filled
the
court
to
the
exclusion
of
almost
all
others
these
were
white
men
it
is
gratifying
to
record
that
the
war
department
recognized
this
special
injustice
to
colored
officers
and
in
the
two
regiments
of
colored
volunteers
recruited
for
service
in
the
philippines
all
the
are
colored
men
the
field
officers
being
white
and
appointed
from
the
regular
army
in
pursuance
of
a
general
policy
thus
far
has
the
general
government
advanced
in
recognition
of
the
military
capacity
of
the
negro
in
the
swing
of
the
pendulum
the
nation
is
now
at
the
place
where
the
hardy
general
butler
was
years
ago
when
he
organized
the
three
regiments
of
louisiana
native
guards
with
all
colored
the
way
in
which
modern
armies
are
organized
and
perfected
leaves
little
necessity
for
an
equipment
of
exceptional
personal
gifts
in
order
to
exercise
ordinary
military
command
the
whole
thing
is
subordinate
and
the
field
for
personal
initiative
is
contracted
to
the
minimum
in
our
own
army
the
president
is
and
the
command
descends
through
a
multitude
of
subordinate
grades
down
to
the
lowest
commissioned
officer
in
the
service
we
have
articles
of
war
and
regulations
and
the
entire
discipline
and
government
of
the
army
is
committed
to
writing
there
is
no
chance
to
enshroud
in
mystery
the
ability
to
command
for
ordinary
military
command
with
intelligence
the
chief
requisite
little
is
required
beyond
courage
firmness
and
good
judgment
these
qualities
are
in
no
respect
natural
barriers
for
colored
men
this
last
story
of
the
negro
soldier
efficiency
and
gallantry
told
in
the
pages
of
this
book
teaches
its
own
very
simple
conclusion
the
cuban
campaign
has
forced
the
nation
to
recognize
the
completion
of
the
negro
evolution
as
a
soldier
in
the
army
of
the
united
states
the
colored
american
soldier
by
his
own
prowess
has
won
an
acknowledged
place
by
the
side
of
the
best
trained
fighters
with
arms
in
the
fullness
of
his
manhood
he
has
no
rejoicing
in
the
patronizing
paean
the
colored
troops
fought
nobly
nor
does
he
glow
at
all
when
told
of
his
faithfulness
and
devotion
to
his
white
officers
qualities
accentuated
to
the
point
where
they
might
well
fit
an
affectionate
dog
he
lays
claim
to
no
prerogative
other
than
that
of
a
plain
citizen
of
the
republic
trained
to
the
profession
of
arms
the
measure
of
his
demand
and
it
is
the
demand
of
ten
millions
of
his
allied
to
him
by
race
is
that
the
full
manhood
privileges
of
a
soldier
be
accorded
him
on
his
record
in
arms
not
excluding
his
manifest
capacity
to
command
the
colored
soldier
speaking
for
the
entire
body
of
colored
citizens
in
this
country
only
demands
that
the
door
of
the
nation
military
training
school
be
freely
open
to
the
capable
of
his
race
and
the
avenue
of
promotion
from
the
ranks
be
accessible
to
his
tried
efficiency

from
the
morning
of
july
until
the
final
convention
was
signed
on
the
sixteenth
of
the
same
month
this
surrender
virtually
closed
the
war
but
did
not
restore
the
contending
nations
to
a
status
of
peace
thousand
spanish
soldiers
had
laid
down
their
arms
and
had
been
transformed
from
enemies
to
friends
on
the
tenth
of
august
following
a
protocol
was
submitted
by
the
president
of
the
united
states
which
was
accepted
by
the
spanish
cabinet
on
the
eleventh
and
on
the
twelfth
the
president
announced
the
cessation
of
hostilities
thus
closing
a
war
which
had
lasted
one
hundred
and
ten
days
on
the
tenth
of
december
a
treaty
of
peace
between
the
united
states
and
spain
was
signed
at
paris
which
was
subsequently
ratified
by
both
nations
and
diplomatic
relations
fully
restored
the
war
though
short
had
been
costly
one
hundred
and
fifty
million
dollars
had
been
spent
in
its
prosecution
and
there
were
left
on
our
hands
the
unsolved
problem
of
cuba
and
the
philippines
which
promised
much
future
trouble
within
a
month
from
the
signing
of
the
convention
the
army
of
invasion
known
as
the
fifth
army
corps
was
on
its
homeward
voyage
and
by
the
latter
part
of
august
the
whole
command
was
well
out
of
cuba
well
did
the
soldiers
themselves
as
well
as
their
friends
realize
as
the
former
returned
from
that
campaign
of
a
hundred
days
that
war
in
the
tropics
was
neither
a
pastime
nor
a
practice
march
the
campaign
had
tested
the
powers
of
endurance
of
the
men
to
its
utmost
limit
the
horrors
of
war
were
brought
directly
to
the
face
of
the
people
as
the
ten
thousand
invalids
dragged
their
debilitated
forms
from
the
transports
to
their
detention
camps
or
to
the
hospitals
some
too
helpless
to
walk
and
many
to
die
soon
after
greeting
their
native
shores
those
who
had
been
so
enthusiastic
for
the
war
were
now
quiet
and
were
eagerly
laying
the
blame
for
the
sorrow
and
suffering
before
them
upon
the
shoulders
of
those
who
had
conducted
the
war
few
stopped
to
think
that
a
good
part
of
this
woe
might
be
justly
charged
to
those
who
had
constantly
resisted
the
establishment
of
an
adequate
standing
army
and
who
with
inconsistent
vehemence
had
urged
the
nation
into
a
war
regardless
of
its
military
equipment
the
emaciated
veterans
arriving
at
montauk
were
spoken
of
as
the
evidences
of
military
incompetency
they
were
also
evidence
of
that
narrow
statesmanship
which
ignores

constant

already
sailed
for

if
desired
by
you
this
may
be
confirmed
by
your
excellency
sending
an
officer
under
a
flag
of
truce
to
admiral
sampson
and
he
can
arrange
to
visit
the
harvard
which
will
not
sail
until
and
obtain
the
details
from
spanish
officers
and
men
on
board
that
ship
our
fleet
is
now
perfectly
free
to
act
and
i
have
the
honor
to
state
that
unless
a
surrender
be
arranged
by
noon
of
the
instant
a
bombardment
will
be
begun
and
continued
by
the
heavy
guns
of
our
ships
the
city
is
within
easy
range
of
these
guns
the
being
capable
of
firing
yards
the
of
course
much
farther
the
ships
can
so
lie
that
with
a
range
of
yards
they
can
reach
the
centre
of
the
city
i
make
this
suggestion
of
a
surrender
purely
in
a
humanitarian
spirit
i
do
not
wish
to
cause
the
slaughter
of
any
more
men
either
of
your
excellency
forces
or
my
own
the
final
result
under
circumstances
so
disadvantageous
to
your
excellency
being
a
foregone
conclusion
as
your
excellency
may
wish
to
make
reference
of
so
momentous
a
question
to
your
excellency
home
government
it
is
for
this
purpose
that
i
have
placed
the
time
of
the
resumption
of
hostilities
sufficiently
far
in
the
future
to
allow
a
reply
being
received
i

i
forwarded
general

proposition
to
evacuate
the
town
this
morning
without
consulting
any
one
since
then
i
have
seen
the
general
officers
commanding
divisions
who
agree
with
me
in
that
it
should
be
accepted
it
releases
at
once
the
harbor
it
permits
the
return
of
thousands
of
women
children
and
old
men
who
have
left
the
town
fearing
bombardment
and
are
now
suffering
fearfully
where
they
are
though
i
am
doing
my
best
to
supply
them
with
food
it
saves
the
great
destruction
of
property
which
a
bombardment
would
entail
most
of
which
belongs
to
cubans
and
foreign
residents
it
at
once
releases
this

it
is
in
good
health
for
operations
elsewhere
there
are
now
three

at

and
if
it
gets
started
no
one
knows
where
it
will
stop
we
lose
by
this
simply
some
prisoners
we
do
not
want
and
the
arms
they
carry
i
believe
many
of
them
will
desert
and
return
to
our
lines
i
was
told
by
a
sentinel
who
deserted
last
night
that

work
thoroughly
when

this
will
be
done
your
telegram
of
this
morning
said
your
position
was
impregnable
and
that
you
believed
the
enemy
would
yet
surrender
unconditionally
you
have
also
assured
us
that
you
could
force
their
surrender
by
cutting
off
their
supplies
under
these
circumstances
your
message
recommending
that
spanish
troops
be
permitted
to
evacuate
and
proceed
without
molestation
to
holguin
is
a
great
surprise
and
is
not
approved
the
responsibility
for
the
destruction
and
distress
to
the
inhabitants
rests
entirely
with
the
spanish
commander
the
secretary
of
war
orders
that
when
you
are
strong
enough
to
destroy
the
enemy
and
take
santiago
you
do
it
if
you
have
not
force
enough
it
will
be
despatched
to
you
at
the
earliest

possible
reinforcements
are
on

the
following
dispatch
sent
by
general
linares
will
show
how
desperate
were
the
straits
into
which
he
had
been
driven
and
how
earnestly
he
desired
to
be
granted
authority
to
avoid
further
fighting
by
the
surrender
of
his
forces
at
santiago
santiago
de
cuba
july
the
to
the
secretary
of
war
although
prostrated
in
bed
from
weakness
and
pain
my
mind
is
troubled
by
the
situation
of
our
suffering
troops
and
therefore
i
think
it
my
duty
to
address
myself
to
you
secretary
and
describe
the
true
situation
the
enemy
forces
very
near
city
ours
extended
fourteen
kilometres
yards
our
troops
exhausted
and
sickly
in
an
alarming
proportion
can
not
be
brought
to
the
hospital
needing
them
in
trenches
cattle
without
fodder
or
hay
fearful
storm
of
rain
which
has
been
pouring
continuously
for
past
hours
soldiers
without
permanent
shelter
their
only
food
rice
and
not
much
of
that
they
have
no
way
of
changing
or
drying
their
clothing
our
losses
were
very
heavy
many
chiefs
and
officers
among
the
dead
wounded
and
sick
their
absence
deprives
the
forces
of
their
leaders
in
this
very
critical
moment
under
these
conditions
it
is
impossible
to
open
a
breach
on
the
enemy
because
it
would
take
a
third
of
our
men
who
can
not
go
out
and
whom
the
enemy
would
decimate
the
result
would
be
a
terrible
disaster
without
obtaining
as
you
desire
the
salvation
of
eleven
maimed
battalions
to
make
a
sortie
protected
by
the
division
at
holguin
it
is
necessary
to
attack
the
enemy
lines
simultaneously
and
the
forces
of
holguin
can
not
come
here
except
after
many
long
marching
impossible
for
them
to
transport
rations
unfortunately
the
situation
is
desperate
the
surrender
is
imminent
otherwise
we
will
only
gain
time
to
prolong
our
agony
the
sacrifice
would
be
sterile
and
the
men
understand
this
with
his
lines
so
near
us
the
enemy
will
annihilate
us
without
exposing
his
own
as
he
did
yesterday
bombarding
by
land
elevations
without
our
being
able
to
discover
their
batteries
and
by
sea
the
fleet
has
a
perfect
knowledge
of
the
place
and
bombards
with
a
mathematical
accuracy
santiago
is
no
gerona
a
walled
city
part
of
the
mother
country
and
defended
inch
by
inch
by
her
own
people
without
distinction
old
men
and
women
who
helped
with
their
lives
moved
by
the
holy
idea
of
freedom
and
with
the
hope
of
help
which
they
received
here
i
am
alone
all
the
people
have
fled
even
those
holding
public
offices
almost
without
exception
only
the
priests
remain
and
they
wish
to
leave
the
city
headed
by
their
archbishop
these
defenders
do
not
start
now
a
campaign
full
of
enthusiasm
and
energy
but
for
three
years
they
have
been
fighting
the
climate
privations
and
fatigue
and
now
they
have
to
confront
this
critical
situation
when
they
have
no
enthusiasm
or
physical
strength
they
have
no
ideals
because
they
defend
the
property
of
people
who
have
deserted
them
and
those
who
are
the
allies
of
the
american
forces
the
honor
of
arms
has
its
limit
and
i
appeal
to
the
judgment
of
the
government
and
of
the
entire
nation
whether
these
patient
troops
have
not
repeatedly
saved
it
since
may
date
of
first
bombardment
if
it
is
necessary
that
i
sacrifice
them
for
reasons
unknown
to
me
or
if
it
is
necessary
for
some
one
to
take
responsibility
for
the
issue
foreseen
and
announced
by
me
in
several
telegrams
i
willingly
offer
myself
as
a
sacrifice
to
my
country
and
i
will
take
charge
of
the
command
for
the
act
of
surrender
as
my
modest
reputation
is
of
small
value
when
the
reputation
of
the
nation
is
at
stake
signed
linares
thus
surrendered
to
our
forces
about
spanish
troops
of
whom
about
had
been
in
the
garrison
of
santiago
the
others
having
been
stationed
in
garrisons
outside
of
the
city
but
belonging
to
the
division
of
santiago
with
them
were
also
surrendered
cannon
machine
guns
and
over
rifles
the
troops
were
all
sent
back
to
spain
in
vessels
of
their
own
nation
and
flying
their
own
flag
we
had
lost
in
battles
with
them
before
the
surrender
officers
killed
and
men
and
officers
and
men
wounded
