robert
browning
preface
it
has
been
assumed
and
is
generally
believed
that
the
struggle
which
culminated
in
the
emancipation
proclamation
of
originated
in
infidelity
and
was
a
triumph
of
skepticism
over
christianity
in
no
way
can
this
error
be
so
well
corrected
as
by
the
personal
history
of
those
who
took
part
in
that
struggle
and
as
most
of
them
have
passed
from
earth
without
leaving
any
record
of
the
education
and
motives
which
underlay
their
action
the
duty
they
neglected
becomes
doubly
incumbent
on
the
few
who
remain
to
supply
one
quota
of
the
inside
history
of
the
great
abolition
war
is
the
primary
object
of
this
work
but
scarcely
secondary
to
this
object
is
that
of
recording
incidents
characteristic
of
the
peculiar
institution
overthrown
in
that
struggle
another
object
and
one
which
struggles
for
precedence
is
to
give
an
inside
history
of
the
hospitals
during
the
war
of
the
rebellion
that
the
american
people
may
not
forget
the
cost
of
that
government
so
often
imperiled
through
their
indifference
a
third
object
is
to
give
an
analysis
of
the
ground
which
produced
the
woman
rights
agitation
and
the
causes
which
limited
its
influence
a
fourth
is
to
illustrate
the
force
of
education
and
the
mutability
of
human
character
by
a
personal
narrative
of
one
who
in
would
have
broken
an
engagement
rather
than
permit
her
name
to
appear
in
print
even
in
the
announcement
of
marriage
and
who
in
had
as
much
newspaper
notoriety
as
any
man
of
that
time
and
was
singularly
indifferent
to
the
praise
or
blame
of
the
press
of
one
who
in
could
not
break
the
seal
of
silence
set
upon
her
lips
by
inspiration
even
so
far
as
to
pray
with
a
man
dying
of
intemperance
and
who
yet
in
addressed
the
minnesota
senate
in
session
and
as
many
others
as
could
be
packed
in
the
hall
with
no
more
embarrassment
than
though
talking

a

half

chapter
i
find
life
those
soft
pink
circles
which
fell
upon
my
face
and
hands
caught
in
my
hair
danced
around
my
feet
and
frolicked
over
the
billowy
waves
of
bright
green
grass
did
i
know
they
were
apple
blossoms
did
i
know
it
was
an
apple
tree
through
which
i
looked
up
to
the
blue
sky
over
which
white
clouds
scudded
away
toward
the
great
hills
had
i
slept
and
been
awakened
by
the
wind
to
find
myself
in
the
world
it
is
probable
that
i
had
for
some
time
been
familiar
with
that
tree
and
all
my
surroundings
for
i
had
been
breathing
two
and
a
half
years
and
had
made
some
progress
in
the
art
of
reading
and
sewing
saying
catechism
and
prayers
i
knew
the
gray
kitten
which
walked
away
knew
that
the
girl
who
brought
it
back
and
reproved
me
for
not
holding
it
was
adaline
my
nurse
knew
that
the
young
lady
who
stood
near
was
cousin
sarah
alexander
and
that
the
girl
to
whom
she
gave
directions
about
putting
bread
into
a
brick
oven
was
big
jane
that
i
was
little
jane
and
that
the
white
house
across
the
common
was
squire
horner
there
was
no
surprise
in
anything
save
the
loveliness
of
blossom
and
tree
of
the
grass
beneath
and
the
sky
above
and
this
first
indelible
imprint
on
my
memory
seems
to
have
found
this
inner
something
i
call
me
as
capable
of
reasoning
as
it
has
ever
been
while
i
sat
and
wondered
father
came
took
me
in
his
loving
arms
and
carried
me
to
mother
room
where
she
lay
in
a
with
blue
foliage
and
blue
birds
outlined
on
the
white
ground
of
the
curtains
like
the
on
the
blue
and
white
sky
the
cover
was
turned
down
and
i
was
permitted
to
kiss
a
and
warned
to
be
good
lest
dampster
who
had
brought
the
baby
should
come
and
take
it
away
this
autocrat
was
pointed
out
as
she
sat
in
a
gray
dress
white
and
cap
and
no
other
potentate
has
ever
inspired
me
with
such
reverential
awe
my
second
memory
is
of
a
great
awakening
to
a
sense
of
sin
and
of
my
lost
and
undone
condition
on
a
warm
summer
day
while
walking
alone
on
the
common
which
lay
between
home
and
squire
horner
house
i
was
struck
motionless
by
the
thought
that
i
had
forgotten
god
it
seemed
probable
considering
the
total
depravity
of
my
nature
that
i
had
been
thinking
bad
thoughts
and
these
i
labored
to
recall
that
i
might
repent
and
plead
with
divine
mercy
for
forgiveness
but
alas
i
could
remember
nothing
save
the
crowning
crime
forgetfulness
of
god
i
seemed
to
stand
outside
and
see
myself
a
mere
mite
in
a
pink
and
white
bib
the
very
chief
of
sinners
for
the
probability
was
i
had
been
thinking
of
that
bonnet
and
bib
it
was
quite
certain
that
god
knew
my
sin
and
ah
the
crushing
horror
that
i
could
by
no
possibility
conceal
aught
from
the
eye
while
it
was
equally
impossible
to
win
its
approval
the
divine
law
was
so
perfect
that
i
could
not
hope
to
meet
its
requirements
the
divine
so
alert
that
no
sin
could
escape
detection
under
that
cloud
of
doom
the
sunshine
grew
dark
and
i
did
not
dare
to
move
until
a
cheery
voice
called
out
something
about
my
pretty
bonnet
and
gave
me
a
sense
of
companionship
in
this
dreadful
dreadful
world
rose
a
large
native
african
had
spoken
to
me
from
her
place
in
squire
horner
kitchen
and
i
went
home
full
of
solemn
resolves
and
sad
forebodings
this
is
probably
what
evangelists
would
call
my
conversion
and
it
came
in
my
third
summer
there
was
a
fire
in
the
grate
when
mother
showed
robt
wilson
our
family
physician
a
pair
of
wristbands
and
collar
i
had
stitched
for
father
and
when
they
spoke
of
me
as
not
being
three
years
old
but
then
i
had
in
my
mind
the
marks
of
that
great
awakening
to
me
no
childhood
was
possible
under
the
training
this
indicates
yet
in
giving
that
training
my
parents
were
loving
and
gentle
as
they
were
faithful
believing
in
the
danger
of
eternal
death
they
could
but
guard
me
from
it
by
the
only
means
of
which
they
had
any
knowledge
before
the
completion
of
that
momentous
third
year
of
life
i
had
learned
to
read
the
new
testament
readily
and
was
deeply
grieved
that
our
pastor
played
patty
cake
with
my
hands
instead
of
hearing
me
recite
my
catechism
and
talking
of
original
sin
during
that
winter
i
went
regularly
to
school
where
i
was
kept
at
the
head
of
a
in
which
were
young
men
and
women
one
of
these
wilkins
mcnair
used
to
carry
me
home
much
amused
no
doubt
by
my
supremacy
his
father
dunning
mcnair
was
proprietor
of
the
village
and
had
been
ridiculed
for
predicting
that
in
the
course
of
human
events
there
would
be
a
graded
mcadamized
road
all
the
way
from
philadelphia
to
pittsburg
and
that
if
he
did
not
live
to
see
it
his
children
would
he
was
a
neighbor
and
friend
of
wm
wilkins
afterwards
judge
secretary
of
war
and
minister
to
russia
and
had
named
his
son
for
him
when
his
prediction
was
fulfilled
and
the
road
made
it
ran
through
his
land
and
on
it
he
laid
out
the
village
and
called
it
wilkinsburg
mcnair
lived
south
of
it
in
a
rough
stone
house
the
manor
of
the
neighborhood
with
half
a
dozen
slave
huts
ranged
before
the
kitchen
door
and
the
gateway
between
his
grounds
and
the
village
as
seen
from
the
upper
windows
of
our
house
was
to
me
the
boundary
between
the
known
and
the
unknown
the
dread
portal
through
which
came
adam
the
poor
old
ragged
slave
with
whom
my
nurse
threatened
me
when
i
did
not
do
as
she
wished
he
was
a
wretched
creature
who
made
and
sold
hickory
brooms
as
he
dragged
his
rheumatic
limbs
on
the
down
grade
of
life
until
he
found
rest
by
freezing
to
death
in
the
woods
where
he
had
gone
for
saplings
i
was
born
on
the
of
december
in
pittsburg
on
the
bank
of
the
monongahela
near
its
confluence
with
the
allegheny
my
father
was
thomas
cannon
and
my
mother
mary
scott
they
were
both
and
descended
from
the
scotch
reformers
on
my
mother
side
were
several
men
and
women
who
signed
the
solemn
league
and
covenant
and
defended
it
to
the
loss
of
livings
lauds
and
life
her
mother
jane
grey
was
of
that
family
which
was
allied
to
royalty
and
gave
to
england
her
nine
day
queen
this
grandmother
i
remember
as
a
stately
old
lady
quaintly
and
plainly
dressed
reading
a
large
bible
or
answering
questions
by
quotations
from
its
pages
she
was
unsuspicious
as
an
infant
always
doubtful
about
actual
transgressions
of
any
while
believing
in
the
total
depravity
of
all
educated
in
ireland
as
an
heiress
she
had
not
been
taught
to
write
lest
she
should
marry
without
the
consent
of
her
elder
brother
guardian
she
felt
that
we
owed
her
undying
gratitude
for
bestowing
her
hand
and
fortune
on
our
grandfather
who
was
but
a
yoeman
even
if
he
did
have
a
good
leasehold
ride
a
high
horse
wear
spurs
and
have
hamilton
blood
in
his
veins
she
made
us
familiar
with
the
battle
of
the
boyne
and
the
sufferings
in
londonderry
in
both
of
which
her
had
shared
but
was
incapable
of
that
sectarian
rancor
which
marks
so
many
descendents
of
the
men
who
met
on
those
fields
of
blood
and
fought
for
their
convictions
in
april
father
moved
from
pittsburg
out
to
the
new
village
of
wilkinsburg
took
with
him
a
large
stock
of
goods
bought
property
built
the
house
in
which
i
first
remember
him
and
planted
the
apple
tree
which
imprinted
the
first
picture
on
my
memory
but
the
crash
which
followed
the
last
war
with
england
brought
general
bankruptcy
the
mortgages
on
mcnair
estate
made
the
titles
valueless
and
this
with
the
fall
of
his
real
estate
in
pittsburg
reduced
father
to
poverty
from
which
he
never
recovered

hunt

see
la
age
my
parents
were
members
of
the
covenanter
congregation
of
which
john
black
was
pastor
for
years
he
was
a
man
of
power
a
profound
logician
with
great
facility
in
conveying
ideas
to
his
pulpit
ministrations
i
am
largely
indebted
for
whatever
ability
i
have
to
discriminate
between
truth
and
falsehood
but
the
church
was
in
pittsburg
and
our
home
seven
miles
away
so
we
seldom
went
to
meeting
the
rules
of
the
denomination
forbade
occasional
hearing
father
and
mother
had
once
been
sessioned
for
stopping
on
their
way
home
to
hear
the
conclusion
of
a
communion
service
in
brace
church
which
was
seceder
so
our
sabbaths
were
usually
spent
in
religious
services
at
home
these
i
enjoyed
as
it
aided
my
of
loving
and
thinking
about
god
who
seemed
to
my
mind
to
have
some
special
need
of
my
attention
nothing
was
done
on
that
day
which
could
have
been
done
the
day
before
or
could
be
postponed
till
the
day
after
coffee
grinding
was
not
thought
of
and
once
when
we
had
no
flour
for
baking
and
the
buckwheat
cakes
were
baked
the
evening
before
and
warmed
on
sabbath
morning
we
were
all
troubled
about
the
violation
of
the
day
there
was
a
presbyterian
two
miles
east
of
wilkinsburg
where
a
large
wealthy
congregation
worshipped
rev
james
graham
was
pastor
and
unlike
other
presbyterians
they
never
profaned
the
sanctuary
by
singing
human
compositions
but
confined
themselves
to
rouse
version
of
david
psalms
as
did
our
own
denomination
this
aided
that
laxness
of
discipline
which
permitted
big
jane
adaline
and
brother
william
to
attend
sometimes
under
care
of
neighbors
once
i
was
allowed
to
accompany
them
i
was
the
proud
possessor
of
a
pair
of
red
shoes
which
i
carried
rolled
up
in
my
while
we
walked
the
two
miles
we
stopped
in
the
woods
my
feet
were
denuded
of
their
commonplace
attire
and
arrayed
in
white
hose
beautifully
clocked
and
those
precious
slices
and
my
poor
conscience
tortured
about
my
vanity
the
girls
also
exchanged
theirs
for
morocco
slippers
we
concealed
our
walking
shoes
under
a
mossy
log
and
proceeded
to
the
it
was
built
in
the
form
of
a
t
of
hewn
logs
and
the
whole
structure
both
inside
and
out
was
a
combination
of
those
soft
grays
and
browns
with
which
nature
colors
wood
and
in
its
close
setting
of
primeval
forest
made
a
harmonious
picture
atone
side
lay
a
graveyard
birds
sang
in
the
surrounding
trees
some
of
which
reached
out
their
giant
arms
and
touched
the
log
walls
swallows
had
built
nests
under
the
eaves
outside
and
some
on
the
rough
projections
inside
and
joined
their
twitter
to
the
songs
of
other
birds
and
the
rich
organ
accompaniment
of
wind
and
trees
there
were
two
sermons
and
in
the
intermission
a
church
sociable
in
fact
if
not
in
name
friends
who
lived
twenty
miles
apart
met
here
exchanged
greetings
and
news
gave
notices
and
invitations
and
obeyed
the
higher
law
of
kindness
under
protest
of
their
calvinistic
consciences
in
this
we
ate
our
lunch
went
to
the
nearest
house
and
had
a
drink
from
the
spring
which
ran
through
the
stone
it
was
a
day
full
of
and
of
solemn
grand
impressions
of
the
two
sermons
i
remember
but
one
and
this
from
the
text
many
are
called
but
few
are
chosen
and
the
comments
were
calvinism
of
the
most
rigid
school
on
our
way
home
my
brother
william
three
years
older
than
i
was
very
silent
and
thoughtful
for
some
time
then
spoke
of
the
sermon
of
which
i
entirely
approved
but
he
stoutly
declared
that
he
did
not
believe
it
did
not
believe
god
called
people
to
come
to
him
while
he
did
not
choose
to
have
them
come
it
would
not
be
fair
indeed
he
thought
it
would
be
mean
that
evening
when
we
were
saying
the
shorter
catechism
the
question
what
are
the
decrees
of
god
came
to
me
and
after
repeating
the
answer
i
asked
father
to
explain
it
not
that
i
needed
any
explanation
but
that
william
might
be
enlightened
for
i
was
anxious
about
his
soul
on
account
of
his
skepticism
enlightened
he
could
not
be
and
even
to
father
expressed
his
doubts
and
disapprobation
we
renewed
the
discussion
when
alone
and
during
all
his
life
i
labored
with
him
but
soon
found
the
common
refuge
of
orthodox
minds
in
feeling
that
those
especially
loved
by
them
will
be
made
exceptions
in
the
general
distribution
of
wrath
due
to
unbelief
one
day
i
went
with
him
to
hunt
the
cow
we
came
to
a
wood
just
north
of
the
village
where
the
wind
roared
and
shook
the
trees
so
that
i
was
quite
but
he
held
my
hand
and
assured
me
there
was
no
danger
until
he
suddenly
drew
me
back
exclaiming
oh
see
as
a
great
tree
came
crashing
down
across
the
path
before
us
and
so
near
that
it
must
have
fallen
on
us
if
he
had
not
seen
it
and
stepped
back
even
then
he
refused
to
go
home
without
the
cow
and
taking
up
a
he
inquired
of
it
where
she
was
and
started
in
the
direction
indicated
when
we
were
arrested
by
the
voice
of
big
jane
who
had
come
to
search
for
us
on
reaching
home
we
found
a
new
elizabeth
soon
after
her
birth
in
april
father
moved
back
to
pittsburg
and
lived
on
sixth
street
opposite
trinity
church
on
property
belonging
to
my
maternal
grandfather
there
was
no
church
there
at
that
time
but
a
thickly
peopled
graveyard
which
adjoined
that
of
the
first
presbyterian
church
on
the
corner
of
sixth
and
wood
these
were
above
the
level
of
the
street
and
were
protected
by
a
that
ran
along
the
top
of
a
green
bank
on
which
we
played
and
gathered
flowers
grandmother
took
me
sometimes
to
walk
in
these
graveyards
at
night
and
there
talked
to
me
about
god
and
heaven
and
the
angels
i
was
sufficiently
interested
in
these
but
especially
longed
to
see
the
ghosts
and
often
went
to
look
for
them
we
had
a
bachelor
uncle
who
delighted
in
telling
us
tales
of
the
supernatural
and
he
peopled
these
graveyards
with
ghosts
in
which
i
believed
as
implicitly
as
in
the
revelations
made
to
john
on
the
isle
of
patmos
which
were
my
favorite
literature
when
the
congregation
concluded
to
abandon
the
round
church
which
stood
on
the
triangle
between
liberty
wood
and
sixth
streets
and
began
to
dig
for
a
foundation
for
trinity
where
it
now
stands
there
was
great
desecration
of
graves
one
day
a
thrill
of
excitement
and
stream
of
talk
ran
through
the
neighborhood
about
a
cooper
whose
body
had
been
buried
three
years
and
was
found
in
a
wonderful
state
of
preservation
when
the
coffin
was
laid
open
by
the
diggers
it
was
left
that
the
friends
might
remove
it
and
that
night
i
felt
would
be
the
time
for
ghosts
so
i
went
over
alone
and
while
i
crouched
by
the
open
grave
peering
in
a
cloud
passed
and
the
moon
poured
down
a
flood
of
light
by
which
i
could
see
the
quiet
sleeper
with
folded
hands
taking
her
last
long
rest
it
was
inexpressibly
grand
solemn
and
sad
there
were
no
gaslights
no
paved
street
near
no
one
stirring
earth
was
far
away
and
heaven
near
at
hand
but
no
ghost
came
and
i
went
home
disappointed
afterwards
i
had
a
still
more
disheartening
adventure
i
had
gone
an
errand
to
cousin
alexander
on
fifth
street
stayed
late
and
coming
home
found
wood
street
deserted
the
moon
shone
brightly
but
on
the
graveyard
side
were
heavy
shadows
except
in
the
open
space
opposite
the
church
i
was
on
the
other
side
and
there
was
the
office
of
the
democratic
paper
and
over
the
door
the
motto
our
country
right
or
wrong
this
had
long
appeared
to
be
an
uncanny
spot
owing
to
the
wickedness
of
this
sentiment
and
i
was
thinking
of
the
possibility
of
seeing
auld
nick
guarding
his
property
when
my
attention
was
attracted
to
a
tall
white
figure
in
the
bright
moonlight
outside
the
graveyard
fence
i
stopped
an
instant
in
great
surprise
and
listened
for
footsteps
but
no
sound
accompanied
the
motion
it
did
not
walk
but
glided
and
must
have
risen
out
of
the
ground
for
only
a
moment
before
there
was
nothing
visible
i
clasped
my
hands
in
mute
wonder
but
my
ghost
was
getting
away
and
to
make
its
acquaintance
i
must
hurry
crossing
the
street
i
ran
after
and
gained
on
it
it
passed
into
the
shadow
of
the
engine
house
on
across
sixth
street
into
the
moonlight
then
into
the
shadow
before
i
overtook
it
when
lo
it
was
a
mortal
woman
barefoot
in
a
dress
which
was
probably
a
faded
print
most
prints
faded
then
and
this
was
white
long
and
scant
making
a
very
ghostly
robe
while
on
her
head
she
carried
a
bundle
tied
up
in
a
sheet
she
had
of
course
come
out
of
virgin
alley
where
many
laundresses
lived
and
had
just
passed
out
of
the
shadow
when
i
saw
her
we
exchanged
salutations
and
i
went
home
to
lie
and
brood
over
the
unreliable
nature
of
ghosts
i
was
trying
to
get
into
a
proper
frame
of
mind
for
saying
my
prayers
but
i
doubt
if
they
were
said
that
night
as
we
were
soon
aroused
by
the
cries
of
fire
henry
clay
was
being
burned
in
effigy
on
the
corner
of
sixth
and
wood
streets
to
show
somebody
disapproval
of
his
course
in
the
election
of
john
quincy
adams
the
democratic
editor
mcfarland
was
tried
and
found
guilty
of
the
offense
and
took
revenge
in
ridiculing
his
opponents
charles
glenn
a
fussy
old
gentleman
member
of
our
church
was
an
important
witness
for
the
prosecution
and
in
the
long
rhyming
account
published
by
the
defendant
he
was
thus
remembered
then
in
came
glenn
that
man
of
peace
and
swore
to
facts
as
sleek
as
grease
by
all
his
uncle
aleck
geese
mcfarland
burnt
the
it
was
before
this
time
that
lafayette
revisited
pittsburg
and
people
went
wild
to
do
him
honor
the
schools
paraded
for
his
inspection
and
ours
was
ranged
along
the
pavement
in
front
of
the
first
presbyterian
church
the
boys
next
the
curb
the
girls
next
the
fence
all
in
holiday
attire
and
wearing
blue
badges
the
distinguished
visitor
passed
up
between
them
leaning
on
the
arm
of
another
gentleman
bowing
and
smiling
as
he
went
when
he
came
to
where
i
stood
he
stepped
aside
laid
his
hand
on
my
head
turned
up
my
face
and
spoke
to
me
i
was
too
happy
to
know
what
he
said
and
in
all
the
years
since
that
day
that
hand
has
lain
on
my
brow
as
a
consecration
chapter
iii
father
age
in
the
city
we
went
regularly
to
meeting
and
black
seemed
always
to
talk
to
and
i
had
no
more
difficulty
in
understanding
his
sermons
than
in
mastering
the
details
of
the
most
simple
duty
the
first
of
which
i
preserve
the
memory
was
about
peter
who
was
made
to
illustrate
the
growth
of
crime
he
began
with
boasting
then
came
its
natural
fruit
cowardice
in
following
his
master
afar
off
next
falsehood
and
from
this
he
proceeded
to
perjury
it
did
seem
that
a
disciple
of
christ
could
go
no
further
but
for
falsehood
and
perjury
there
might
be
excuse
in
the
hope
of
reward
and
peter
found
a
lower
deep
for
he
began
to
curse
and
to
swear
a
profane
swearer
is
without
temptation
and
serves
the
devil
for
the
pure
love
of
the
service
what
more
could
peter
do
to
prove
that
he
knew
not
jesus
in
the
communion
service
is
a
ceremony
called
fencing
the
tables
which
consists
of
an
appeal
to
the
consciences
of
intended
communicants
black
began
with
the
first
commandment
and
forbade
those
living
in
its
violation
to
come
to
the
table
and
so
proceeded
through
the
decalogue
when
he
came
to
the
eighth
he
straightened
himself
placed
his
hands
behind
him
and
with
thrilling
emphasis
said
i
debar
from
this
holy
table
of
the
lord
all
and
and
other
dishonest
persons
and
without
another
word
passed
to
the
ninth
commandment
soon
after
we
returned
to
the
city
sister
mary
died
of
consumption
and
father
health
began
to
fail
i
have
preserved
the
spinning
wheel
on
which
mother
converted
flax
yarn
into
thread
which
she
sold
to
aid
in
the
support
of
the
family
but
soon
the
entire
burden
fell
on
her
for
father
illness
developed
into
consumption
from
which
he
died
in
march
in
spite
of
all
the
testamentary
precautions
he
could
take
whatever
of
his
estate
might
have
been
available
for
present
support
was
in
the
hands
of
lawyers
and
mother
was
left
with
her
children
and
the
debts
there
were
the
contents
of
his
shop
and
warehouse
some
valuable
real
estate
in
pittsburg
which
had
passed
out
of
his
possession
on
a
claim
of
and
a
village
home
minus
a
title
william
was
a
mechanical
genius
so
mother
set
him
to
making
little
chairs
which
he
readily
sold
but
he
liked
better
to
construct
fire
engines
which
were
quite
wonderful
but
brought
no
money
he
had
a
splendid
physique
was
honorable
and
faithful
and
if
mother
had
been
guided
by
natural
instinct
in
governing
him
all
would
have
been
well
but
he
never
met
the
requirements
of
the
elders
of
the
church
who
felt
it
their
duty
to
manage
our
family
affairs
so
he
was
often
in
trouble
and
i
who
gloried
in
him
contrived
to
shield
him
from
many
a
storm
at
this
time
there
was
a
fashionable
for
lace
work
mother
sent
me
to
learn
it
and
then
procured
me
pupils
whom
i
taught
usually
sitting
on
their
knee
but
lace
work
soon
gave
way
to
painting
on
velvet
this
too
i
learned
and
found
profit
in
selling
pictures
ah
what
pictures
i
did
make
i
reached
the
culminating
glory
of
artist
life
when
judge
braden
of
butler
gave
me
a
new
crisp
five
dollar
bill
for
a
goddess
of
liberty
indeed
he
wanted
me
to
be
educated
for
an
artist
and
was
and
generous
enough
to
have
been
my
permanent
patron
had
an
artistic
education
or
any
other
education
been
possible
for
a
western
pennsylvania
girl
in
that
dark
age
the
first
half
of
the
nineteenth
century
mother
made
a
discovery
in
the
art
of
coloring
leghorn
and
straw
bonnets
which
brought
her
plenty
of
work
so
we
never
lacked
comforts
of
life
although
grandfather
executors
made
us
pay
rent
for
the
house
we
occupied
chapter
iv
go
to
age
during
my
childhood
there
were
no
public
schools
in
pennsylvania
the
state
was
pretty
well
supplied
with
colleges
for
boys
while
girls
were
permitted
to
go
to
subscription
schools
to
these
we
were
sent
part
of
the
time
and
in
one
of
them
joseph
caldwell
afterwards
a
prominent
missionary
to
india
was
a
schoolmate
but
we
had
black
sermons
full
of
grand
morals
science
and
history
in
lieu
of
colleges
for
girls
there
were
and
edgeworth
was
esteemed
one
of
the
best
in
the
state
it
was
at
braddock
field
and
olever
an
english
woman
of
high
culture
was
its
founder
and
principal
to
it
my
cousin
mary
alexander
was
sent
but
returned
homesick
and
refused
to
go
back
unless
i
went
with
her
it
was
arranged
that
i
should
go
for
a
few
weeks
as
i
was
greatly
in
need
of
country
air
and
highly
delighted
i
was
at
the
rendezvous
at
the
hour
one
with
my
box
ready
for
this
excursion
into
the
world
of
polite
literature
mary
was
also
there
and
a
new
scholar
but
father
olever
did
not
come
for
us
until
four
he
was
a
small
nervous
gentleman
and
lamps
were
already
lighted
in
the
smoky
city
when
we
started
to
drive
twelve
miles
through
spring
mud
on
a
cloudy
cheerless
afternoon
we
knew
he
had
no
confidence
in
his
power
to
manage
those
horses
though
we
also
knew
he
would
do
his
best
to
save
us
from
harm
but
as
darkness
closed
around
us
i
think
we
felt
like
babes
in
the
woods
and
shuddered
with
vague
fear
as
much
as
with
cold
and
damp
when
we
reached
the
bullock
pens
half
a
mile
west
of
wilkinsburg
there
were
many
lights
and
much
bustle
in
and
around
the
old
yellow
tavern
where
teamsters
were
attending
to
their
weary
horses
here
we
turned
off
to
the
old
mud
road
and
came
to
a
place
of
which
i
had
no
previous
knowledge
a
place
of
outer
darkness
and
chattering
teeth
we
met
no
more
teams
saw
no
more
lights
but
seemed
to
be
in
an
utterly
uninhabited
country
then
after
an
hour
of
wearisome
jolting
and
plunging
we
discovered
that
the
darkness
had
not
been
total
for
the
line
of
the
horizon
had
been
visible
but
now
it
was
swallowed
up
we
knew
we
were
in
a
wood
by
the
rush
of
the
wind
amid
the
dried
white
oak
leaves
knew
that
the
road
grew
rougher
at
every
step
that
our
driver
became
more
nervous
as
he
applied
the
brake
and
we
went
down
down
still
the
descent
grew
steeper
we
stopped
and
father
olever
felt
for
the
bank
with
his
whip
to
be
sure
we
were
on
the
road
then
we
heard
the
sound
of
rushing
angry
waters
mingled
with
the
roar
of
the
wind
and
he
seemed
to
hesitate
about
going
on
but
we
could
not
very
well
stay
there
and
he
once
more
put
his
horses
in
motion
while
we
held
fast
and
prayed
silently
to
the
great
deliverer
after
stopping
again
and
feeling
for
the
bank
lest
we
should
go
over
the
precipitous
hillside
which
he
knew
was
there
he
proceeded
until
with
a
great
plunge
we
were
in
the
angry
waters
which
arose
to
the
and
roared
and
surged
all
around
us
the
horses
tried
to
go
on
when
something
gave
way
and
our
guardian
concluded
further
progress
was
impossible
and
began
to
hallo
at
the
top
of
his
voice
for
a
long
time
there
was
no
response
then
came
an
answering
call
from
a
long
distance
next
a
light
appeared
and
that
too
was
far
away
but
came
toward
us
when
it
reached
the
brink
of
the
water
and
two
men
with
it
we
felt
safe
the
held
it
up
so
that
we
saw
him
quite
well
and
his
peculiar
appearance
suited
his
surroundings
he
was
more
an
overgrown
boy
than
a
man
beardless
with
a
long
swarthy
face
black
hair
and
keen
black
eyes
he
wore
heavy
boots
outside
his
pantaloons
a
blouse
and
slouch
hat
spoke
to
his
companion
as
one
having
authority
and
with
a
laugh
said
to
our
small
gentleman
is
this
where
you
are
but
gave
no
heed
to
the
answer
as
he
waded
in
and
threw
off
the
check
lines
saying
i
wonder
you
did
not
drown
your
horses
he
next
examined
the
wagon
paying
no
more
attention
to
father
explanations
than
to
the
water
in
which
he
seemed
quite
at
home
and
when
he
had
finished
his
inspection
he
said
they
must
go
to
the
house
and
handing
the
light
to
the
driver
he
took
us
up
one
by
one
and
carried
us
to
the
wet
bank
as
easily
as
a
child
carries
her
doll
he
gave
some
directions
to
his
companion
took
the
light
and
said
to
us
come
on
and
we
walked
after
him
out
into
the
limitless
blackness
nothing
doubting
we
went
what
seemed
a
long
way
following
this
stranger
without
seeing
any
sign
of
life
or
hearing
any
sound
save
the
roar
of
wind
and
water
but
on
turning
a
fence
corner
we
came
in
sight
of
a
large
house
with
a
bright
light
streaming
out
through
many
windows
and
a
wide
open
door
there
was
a
large
stone
barn
on
the
other
side
of
the
road
and
to
this
our
conductor
turned
saying
to
us
go
on
to
the
house
this
we
did
and
were
met
at
the
open
door
by
a
woman
shading
with
one
hand
the
candle
held
in
the
other
this
threw
a
strong
light
on
her
face
which
instantly
reminded
me
of
an
eagle
she
wore
a
white
cap
over
her
black
hair
and
looked
suspiciously
at
us
through
her
small
keen
black
eyes
but
kindly
bade
us
come
in
to
a
low
wainscoted
hall
with
broad
stairway
and
many
open
doors
through
one
of
these
and
a
second
door
we
saw
a
great
fire
of
logs
and
i
should
have
liked
to
sit
by
it
but
she
led
us
into
a
square
wainscoted
room
on
the
opposite
side
in
which
blazed
a
coal
fire
almost
as
large
as
the
log
heap
in
the
kitchen
she
gave
us
seats
and
a
man
who
sat
in
the
corner
spoke
to
us
and
made
me
feel
comfortable
up
to
this
time
all
the
surroundings
had
had
an
air
of
enchanted
castles
brigands
ghosts
witches
the
alert
woman
with
the
eagle
face
in
spite
of
her
kindness
made
me
feel
myself
an
object
of
doubtful
character
but
this
old
man
set
me
quite
at
ease
we
were
no
more
than
well
warmed
when
the
wagon
drove
to
the
door
and
the
with
the
lantern
appeared
saying
come
on
we
followed
him
again
and
he
lifted
us
into
the
wagon
while
the
mistress
of
the
house
stood
on
the
large
shading
her
and
giving
directions
about
our
wraps
coming
events
cast
their
shadows
before
when
they
are
between
us
and
the
light
but
that
night
the
light
must
have
been
between
them
and
me
for
i
bade
to
our
hostess
without
any
premonition
we
should
ever
again
meet
or
that
i
should
sit
alone
as
i
do
over
half
a
century
later
in
that
same
old
wainscoted
room
listening
to
the
roar
of
those
same
angry
waters
and
the
rush
of
the
wind
wrestling
with
the
groaning
trees
in
the
dense
darkness
of
this
low
valley
when
we
had
been
carefully
bestowed
in
the
wagon
our
deliverer
took
up
his
lantern
saying
to
father
olever
drive
on
he
was
obeyed
and
led
the
way
over
a
bridge
across
another
noisy
stream
and
along
a
road
where
there
was
the
sound
of
a
waterfall
very
near
then
up
a
steep
rocky
way
until
he
stopped
saying
i
guess
you
can
get
along
now
to
father
olever
thanks
he
only
replied
by
a
low
contemptuous
but
laugh
as
he
turned
to
retrace
his
steps
all
comfort
and
strength
and
hope
seemed
to
go
with
him
we
were
abandoned
to
our
fate
babes
in
the
woods
again
with
only
god
for
our
reliance
but
after
a
while
we
could
see
the
horizon
and
arrived
at
our
destination
several
minutes
before
midnight
to
find
the
great
mansion
full
of
glancing
lights
and
busy
expectant
life
the
large
family
had
waited
up
for
father
olever
return
for
he
and
his
wagon
were
the
connecting
link
between
that
establishment
and
the
outside
world
he
appeared
to
great
advantage
surrounded
by
a
bevy
of
girls
clamoring
for
letters
and
messages
to
me
the
scene
was
i
had
never
before
seen
anything
so
grand
as
the
great
hall
with
its
polished
stairway
we
had
supper
in
the
housekeeper
room
and
i
was
taken
up
this
stairway
and
then
up
and
up
a
corkscrew
cousin
until
we
reached
the
attic
which
stretched
over
the
whole
house
one
great
dormitory
called
the
here
i
was
to
sleep
with
helen
semple
a
pittsburg
girl
of
about
my
own
age
a
frail
blonde
who
quite
won
my
heart
at
our
first
meeting
next
day
was
sabbath
and
i
was
greatly
surprised
to
see
pupils
walk
on
the
lawn
this
was
such
a
desecration
of
the
day
but
i
made
no
remark
i
was
too
solemnly
impressed
by
the
grandeur
of
being
at
field
to
have
hinted
that
anything
could
be
wrong
but
for
my
own
share
in
the
violation
i
was
painfully
penitent
this
was
not
new
for
there
were
a
long
series
of
years
in
which
the
principal
business
of
six
days
of
every
week
was
repentance
for
the
very
poor
use
made
of
the
seventh
and
from
this
dreary
treadmill
of
sin
and
sorrow
no
faith
ever
could
or
did
free
me
i
never
could
see
salvation
in
christ
apart
from
salvation
from
sin
and
while
the
sin
remained
the
salvation
was
doubtful
and
the
sorrow
certain
on
the
afternoon
of
that
first
sabbath
a
number
of
young
lady
pupils
came
to
the
for
a
visit
and
as
i
afterwards
learned
to
inspect
and
name
the
two
new
girls
when
i
was
promptly
and
unanimously
dubbed
wax
doll
after
a
time
one
remarked
that
they
must
go
and
study
their
ancient
history
lesson
i
caught
greedily
at
the
words
ancient
history
ah
if
i
could
only
be
permitted
to
study
such
a
lesson
no
such
progress
or
promotion
seemed
open
to
me
but
the
thought
interfered
with
my
prayers
and
followed
me
into
the
realm
of
sleep
so
when
that
class
was
called
next
forenoon
i
was
alert
and
what
was
my
surprise
to
hear
those
privileged
girls
stumbling
over
the
story
of
sampson
could
it
be
possible
that
was
ancient
history
how
did
it
come
to
pass
that
every
one
did
not
know
all
about
sampson
the
man
who
had
laid
his
lead
on
delilah
wicked
lap
to
be
shorn
of
his
strength
if
there
is
any
thing
in
that
account
or
any
lesson
to
be
drawn
from
it
with
which
i
was
not
then
familiar
it
is
something
i
have
never
learned
indeed
i
seemed
to
have
completed
my
theological
education
before
i
did
my
twelfth
year
one
morning
olever
sent
for
me
and
told
me
she
had
learned
my
mother
was
not
able
to
send
me
to
school
but
if
i
would
take
charge
of
the
lessons
of
the
little
girls
she
would
furnish
me
board
and
tuition
this
most
generous
offer
quite
took
my
breath
away
and
was
most
gladly
accepted
but
it
was
easy
work
and
i
wondered
my
own
studies
were
so
light
i
was
allowed
to
amuse
myself
drawing
flowers
which
were
quite
a
surprise
and
pronounced
better
than
anything
the
drawing
master
could
do
to
recite
poetry
for
the
benefit
of
the
larger
girls
and
to
play
in
the
orchard
with
my
pupils
with
the
other
girls
i
became
interested
in
i
had
read
the
children
of
the
abbey
and
amanda
romantic
adventures
enchanted
me
but
she
was
quite
outside
my
life
now
i
made
a
nearer
acquaintance
with
her
she
changed
her
residence
so
had
i
she
had
brown
ringlets
i
too
should
have
them
so
one
friday
night
my
hair
was
put
up
in
papers
and
next
morning
i
let
loose
an
amazing
shower
of
curls
the
next
thing
to
do
was
to
go
off
alone
and
sit
reading
in
a
romantic
spot
of
course
i
did
not
expect
to
meet
lord
mortimer
miss
fitzallen
never
had
any
such
expectations
i
was
simply
going
out
to
read
and
admire
the
beauties
of
nature
when
i
had
seated
myself
in
proper
attitude
on
the
gnarled
root
of
an
old
tree
overhanging
a
lovely
ravine
i
proceeded
to
the
reading
part
of
the
play
and
must
of
course
be
too
much
absorbed
to
hear
the
approaching
footsteps
to
which
i
listened
with
bated
breath
so
i
did
not
look
up
when
they
stopped
at
my
side
or
until
a
pleasant
voice
said
why
you
look
quite
romantic
my
dear
then
i
saw
miss
olever
the
head
teacher
familiarly
called
sissy
jane
in
that
real
and
beautiful
presence
miss
fitzallen
retired
to
her
old
place
and
oh
the
mortification
she
left
behind
her
i
looked
up
a
detected
criminal
into
the
face
of
her
who
had
brought
to
me
this
humiliation
and
took
for
a
model
my
folly
did
not
prevent
our
being
sincere
friends
during
all
her
earnest
and
beautiful
life
she
passed
on
and
i
got
back
to
the
when
i
disposed
of
my
curls
and
never
again
played
heroine
chapter
lose
my
age
measured
by
the
calendar
my
life
was
six
weeks
but
measured
by
its
pleasant
memories
it
was
as
many
years
mother
wrote
for
me
to
come
home
and
in
going
i
saw
by
sunlight
the
scene
of
our
adventure
that
dark
night
going
out
it
was
a
lovely
valley
walled
in
by
steep
wooded
hills
two
ravines
joined
bringing
each
its
contribution
of
running
water
and
pouring
it
into
the
larger
stream
of
the
larger
valley
a
veritable
meeting
of
the
waters
in
all
of
nature
work
beautiful
exceedingly
the
house
which
stood
in
the
center
of
a
large
green
meadow
through
which
the
road
ran
was
built
in
two
parts
of
hewn
logs
with
one
great
stone
chimney
on
the
outside
protected
by
an
overshot
in
the
roof
but
that
one
in
which
the
burned
that
night
was
inside
one
end
had
been
an
indian
fort
when
braddock
tried
to
reach
fort
pitt
by
that
road
the
other
end
and
stone
barn
had
been
built
by
its
present
proprietor
a
log
mill
the
oldest
in
allegheny
county
stood
below
the
barn
and
to
it
the
french
soldiers
had
come
for
meal
from
fort
duquesne
the
stream
crossed
by
the
bridge
was
the
and
the
waterfall
made
by
the
it
was
the
homestead
of
a
soldier
of
the
revolution
one
of
washington
lieutenants
the
old
man
we
had
seen
the
woman
was
his
second
wife
they
had
a
numerous
family
and
an
unpronounceable
name
at
home
i
learned
that
on
account
of
a
cough
i
had
been
the
object
of
a
generous
conspiracy
between
mother
and
olever
and
had
been
brought
home
because
i
was
worse
our
doctors
said
i
was
in
the
first
stage
of
consumption
that
elizabeth
was
to
reach
that
point
early
in
life
and
that
our
only
hope
lay
in
plenty
of
calomel
mother
had
lost
her
husband
and
four
vigorous
children
there
had
been
no
lack
of
calomel
and
now
when
death
again
threatened
she
resolved
to
conduct
the
defense
on
some
new
plan
she
had
gained
legal
possession
of
our
village
home
and
moved
to
it
our
lot
was
large
and
well
supplied
with
choice
fruit
and
the
place
seemed
a
paradise
after
our
starved
lives
in
the
smoky
city
my
apple
tree
still
grew
at
the
east
end
of
the
house
there
was
a
willow
tree
mother
had
planted
which
now
swept
the
ground
with
its
long
graceful
branches
there
were
quantities
of
rose
and
lilac
bushes
a
walled
spring
of
delicious
water
in
the
cellar
and
a
whole
world
of
wealth
but
the
potato
lot
looked
up
in
despair
a
patch
of
yellow
clay
mother
put
a
twelve
years
accumulation
of
coal
ashes
on
it
and
thus
proved
them
valuable
both
as
a
fertilizer
and
a
preventive
of
though
at
first
her
project
met
general
opposition
william
did
the
heavy
work
and
was
proud
of
it
he
was
in
splendid
health
for
his
insubordination
had
from
a
very
early
age
saved
him
from
drugging
either
mental
or
physical
the
lighter
gardening
became
part
of
my
treatment
for
consumption
by
having
me
each
day
lie
on
the
floor
on
my
back
without
a
pillow
and
gentle
use
of
mother
straightened
my
spine
and
developed
my
chest
my
clothes
being
carefully
adapted
to
its
expansion
dancing
was
strictly
forbidden
by
our
church
but
mother
was
educated
in
ireland
and
danced
beautifully
she
had
a
class
of
girls
and
taught
us
and
with
plenty
of
fresh
air
milk
and
eggs
effectually
disposed
of
hereditary
consumption
in
her
family
but
while
attending
to
us
she
must
also
make
a
living
so
she
bought
a
stock
of
goods
on
credit
opened
a
store
and
soon
had
a
paying
business
in
this
i
was
her
special
assistant
but
the
work
supplied
to
william
did
not
satisfy
the
holy
men
of
the
church
who
furnished
us
advice
he
still
made
fire
engines
and
a
brook
in
a
meadow
presented
irresistible
temptation
to
and
machinery
one
of
his
made
a
very
good
ghost
haunting
the
meadow
and
keeping
off
trespassers
he
had
a
foundry
where
he
cast
miniature
cannon
kettles
and
curious
things
and
his
was
a
neighborhood
wonder
he
brought
water
from
the
cellar
and
did
other
chores
which
pennsylvania
rules
assigned
to
women
and
when
boys
ridiculed
him
he
flogged
them
and
did
it
quite
as
effectually
as
he
rendered
them
the
same
service
when
they
were
rude
to
a
girl
he
was
a
universal
favorite
even
if
he
did
hate
catechism
and
love
cake
so
mother
conscience
was
worked
upon
until
she
bound
him
to
a
cabinet
maker
in
the
city
to
him
the
restraint
was
unendurable
and
he
ran
away
he
came
after
dark
to
bid
me
left
love
for
mother
and
elizabeth
and
next
morning
left
pittsburg
on
a
steamboat
going
to
that
eldorado
of
pittsburg
boys
down
the
river
for
some
time
letters
came
regularly
from
him
and
he
was
happy
and
prosperous
then
they
ceased
and
after
two
years
of
agonizing
suspense
we
heard
that
he
had
died
of
yellow
fever
in
new
orleans
to
us
this
was
dreadful
irreparable
and
was
wholly
due
to
that
piety
which
permits
no
natural
growth
but
sets
down
all
human
loves
and
longings
as
of
satanic
origin
soon
after
our
removal
to
the
village
grandfather
estate
was
advertised
for
sheriff
sale
mother
had
the
proceedings
stayed
the
executors
dismissed
and
took
out
letters
of
administration
which
made
it
necessary
for
her
to
spend
some
portion
of
every
month
in
the
city
this
threw
the
entire
charge
of
house
and
store
on
me
as
soon
therefore
as
possible
she
sent
me
to
the
city
to
school
where
i
realized
my
aspiration
of
studying
ancient
history
and
the
piano
and
devoured
the
contents
of
the
of
natural
philosophy
with
an
avidity
i
had
never
known
for
a
novel
in
april
i
began
to
teach
school
the
only
one
in
wilkinsburg
and
had
plenty
of
pupils
young
men
and
women
boys
and
girls
at
two
dollars
and
one
dollar
and
a
half
a
term
taught
seven
hours
a
day
and
saturday
forenoon
which
was
devoted
to
bible
reading
and
catechism
i
was
the
first
i
believe
in
allegheny
to
teach
children
without
beating
them
i
abolished
corporeal
punishment
entirely
and
was
so
successful
that
boys
ungovernable
at
home
were
altogether
tractable
this
life
was
perfectly
congenial
and
i
followed
it
for
nearly
six
years
mother
started
a
sabbath
school
the
only
one
in
the
village
and
this
too
we
continued
for
years
one
of
the
pupils
was
a
girl
of
thirteen
daughter
of
a
farmer
who
lived
within
a
mile
of
the
village
her
father
had
been
converted
at
a
and
was
a
devout
methodist
the
first
day
she
attended
i
asked
her
the
question
how
many
gods
are
there
she
thought
a
moment
and
then
said
with
an
air
of
satisfaction
five
i
was
shocked
and
answered
in
the
language
of
the
catechism
o
margaret
is
but
one
only
living
and
true
god
she
hung
her
head
then
nodded
it
and
with
the
emphasis
of
a
judge
who
had
weighed
all
the
evidence
said
i
am
sure
i
ha
hearn
tell
o
more
nur
one
of
em
a
young
theological
student
came
sometimes
to
stay
over
sabbath
and
assist
in
the
school
he
led
in
family
worship
and
had
quite
a
nice
time
until
one
evening
he
read
a
chapter
from
the
song
of
songs
which
was
solomon
when
i
bethought
me
that
he
was
very
much
afraid
of
toads
i
began
to
cultivate
those
creatures
so
that
it
always
seemed
probable
i
had
one
in
my
pocket
or
sleeve
the
path
of
that
good
young
man
became
thorny
until
it
diverged
from
mine
i
was
almost
fifteen
when
i
overheard
a
young
lady
say
i
was
growing
pretty
i
went
to
my
mirror
and
spent
some
moments
in
unalloyed
happiness
and
triumph
then
i
thought
pretty
face
the
worms
will
eat
you
all
the
prettiest
girls
i
know
are
silly
but
you
shall
never
make
a
fool
of
me
helen
beauty
ruined
troy
cleopatra
was
a
wretch
so
if
you
are
pretty
will
be
master
remember
that
chapter
vi
join
church
and
make
new
endeavors
to
keep
age
in
the
year
the
covenanter
church
of
this
country
said
in
her
synod
slavery
and
christianity
are
incompatible
and
never
relaxed
her
discipline
which
forbade
fellowship
with
so
i
was
brought
up
an
abolitionist
i
was
still
a
child
when
i
went
through
wilkins
township
collecting
names
to
a
petition
for
the
abolition
of
slavery
in
the
district
of
columbia
here
in
a
strictly
orthodox
presbyterian
community
i
was
everywhere
met
by
the
objections
niggers
have
no
souls
the
jews
held
slaves
noah
cursed
canaan
and
these
points
i
argued
from
house
to
house
occasionally
for
three
years
and
made
that
acquaintance
which
led
to
my
being
sent
for
in
cases
of
sickness
and
death
before
i
had
completed
my
sixteenth
year
in
this
i
in
some
measure
took
the
place
long
filled
by
mother
who
was
often
a
substitute
for
doctor
and
preacher
looking
back
at
her
life
i
think
how
little
those
know
of
calvinists
who
regard
them
merely
as
a
class
of
autocrats
conscious
of
their
own
election
to
glory
and
rejoicing
in
the
reprobation
of
all
others
for
i
have
never
known
such
humble
people
as
i
have
found
in
that
faith
mother
whose
life
was
full
of
wisdom
and
good
works
doubted
even
to
the
last
her
own
acceptance
with
god
she
and
i
believed
that
a
jealous
god
who
can
brook
no
rivals
had
taken
away
our
loving
husband
and
father
our
strong
and
brave
son
and
brother
because
we
loved
them
too
much
and
i
was
brought
up
to
think
it
a
great
presumption
to
assume
that
such
a
worm
of
the
dust
as
i
could
be
aught
to
the
creator
but
a
subject
of
punishment
during
the
spring
of
mother
said
to
me
sabbath
week
is
our
communion
and
i
thought
you
might
wish
to
join
the
church
i
was
startled
and
without
looking
up
said
am
i
old
enough
if
you
feel
that
the
dying
command
of
the
savior
this
in
remembrance
of
me
was
addressed
to
you
you
are
old
enough
to
obey
it
not
another
word
was
said
and
the
subject
was
never
again
broached
between
us
but
here
a
great
conflict
began
that
command
was
given
to
me
but
how
could
i
obey
it
without
eating
and
drinking
damnation
to
myself
was
mine
a
saving
faith
or
did
i
like
the
devils
believe
and
tremble
i
had
been
believing
as
long
as
i
could
remember
but
did
not
seem
to
grow
in
the
image
of
god
the
conflict
lasted
several
days
sleep
left
me
the
heavens
were
iron
and
the
earth
brass
i
turned
to
erskine
to
learn
the
signs
of
saving
faith
but
found
only
reason
to
suspect
i
could
not
submit
to
god
will
could
not
be
willing
that
william
should
be
lost
nay
i
was
not
willing
that
any
one
should
be
lost
i
could
not
stay
in
heaven
and
know
that
any
one
was
enduring
endless
torments
in
some
other
place
i
must
leave
and
go
to
their
relief
it
was
dreadful
that
abraham
did
not
even
try
to
go
to
poor
dives
or
to
send
some
one
my
whole
soul
flew
into
open
revolt
then
oh
the
total
depravity
which
could
question
the
ways
of
god
to
man
i
hated
milton
i
despised
his
devils
had
a
supreme
contempt
for
the
prince
of
the
power
of
the
air
did
not
remember
a
time
when
i
was
afraid
of
him
god
was
my
refuge
and
my
shield
in
straits
a
present
aid
if
he
took
care
of
me
no
one
else
could
hurt
me
if
he
did
not
no
one
else
could
and
to
be
accepted
by
him
was
all
there
was
or
could
be
worth
caring
for
but
how
should
i
find
this
acceptance
with
my
heart
full
of
rebellion
one
afternoon
i
became
unable
to
think
but
a
white
mist
settled
down
over
hell
even
those
contemptible
devils
were
having
their
tongues
cooled
with
blessed
drops
of
water
the
fires
grew
dim
and
it
seemed
as
if
there
was
to
be
a
rain
of
grace
and
mercy
in
that
region
of
despair
then
i
preferred
my
petition
that
god
would
write
his
name
upon
my
forehead
and
give
me
that
new
name
which
should
mark
me
as
his
that
he
would
bring
william
into
the
fold
and
do
with
me
as
he
would
i
would
be
content
to
spend
my
whole
life
in
any
labor
he
should
appoint
without
a
sign
of
the
approval
of
god
or
man
if
in
the
end
i
and
mine
should
be
found
among
those
who
had
washed
their
robes
and
made
them
white
in
the
blood
of
the
lamb
i
fell
asleep
slept
hours
and
when
the
sun
was
setting
woke
in
perfect
peace
my
proposition
had
been
accepted
and
wonderful
grace
which
had
given
what
i
had
not
dared
to
ask
assurance
of
present
acceptance
i
should
have
all
the
work
and
privation
for
which
i
had
bargained
should
be
a
in
the
vineyard
should
be
set
to
tasks
from
which
other
laborers
shrank
but
in
no
trial
could
i
ever
be
alone
and
should
at
last
hear
the
welcome
well
done
i
arose
as
one
from
a
grave
to
a
joyous
resurrection
but
kept
all
these
things
in
my
heart
personal
experiences
being
altogether
between
god
and
the
soul
were
not
considered
fit
subjects
for
conversation
and
when
i
came
before
the
session
applying
for
church
membership
no
mention
was
made
of
them
except
as
a
general
confession
of
faith
rev
andrew
black
addressed
the
table
at
which
i
sat
in
my
first
communion
and
said
the
lord
supper
has
been
named
the
eucharist
after
the
oath
taken
by
a
roman
soldier
never
to
turn
his
back
upon
his
leader
you
in
partaking
of
these
emblems
do
solemnly
vow
that
you
will
never
turn
your
back
upon
christ
but
that
you
will
follow
him
whithersoever
he
goeth
let
others
do
as
they
will
you
are
to
follow
the
lamb
through
good
and
through
evil
report
to
a
palace
or
to
a
prison
follow
him
even
if
he
should
lead
you
out
of
the
church
this
was
in
perfect
harmony
with
my
private
agreement
and
no
other
act
of
my
life
has
been
so
solemn
or
in
its
consequences
as
that
ratification
of
my
vow
and
it
is
one
i
have
least
cause
to
repent
however
it
brought
a
new
phase
to
an
old
trouble
how
should
i
follow
christ
i
could
not
do
as
he
had
done
i
could
not
go
to
meeting
every
sabbath
and
society
every
friday
and
if
i
did
was
that
following
christ
who
never
built
a
or
conducted
any
service
resembling
those
now
held
i
read
the
life
of
jonathan
edwards
and
settled
back
into
the
old
rut
resolving
to
do
my
best
i
prayed
all
week
for
grace
to
keep
the
next
sabbath
i
rose
early
that
prayed
as
soon
as
my
eyes
were
open
read
a
chapter
looked
out
into
the
beautiful
morning
thought
about
god
and
prayed
spent
so
much
time
praying
that
elizabeth
had
breakfast
ready
when
i
went
down
stairs
while
i
ate
it
i
held
my
thoughts
to
the
work
of
the
day
worshiping
god
but
many
facts
and
fancies
forced
themselves
in
and
disturbed
my
pious
meditations
after
breakfast
i
went
back
to
my
room
to
continue
my
labor
but
mother
soon
came
and
said
do
you
intend
to
let
elizabeth
do
all
the
work
i
dropped
my
roll
of
saintship
and
went
and
washed
the
dishes
had
i
been
taught
that
he
who
does
any
honest
work
serves
god
and
follows
christ
what
a
world
of
woe
would
have
been
spared
me
chapter
vii
the
deliverer
of
the
dark
age
quiltings
furnished
the
principal
amusement
and
at
these
i
was
in
requisition
both
for
my
expertness
with
the
needle
and
my
skill
in
laying
out
work
but
as
i
had
no
brother
to
come
for
me
i
usually
went
home
before
the
evening
frolic
which
consisted
of
plays
male
and
female
partners
went
through
the
common
quadrille
figures
keeping
time
to
the
music
of
their
own
voices
and
making
a
denouement
every
few
moments
by
some
man
kissing
some
woman
perhaps
in
a
dark
hall
or
some
woman
kissing
some
man
or
some
man
kissing
all
the
women
or
elders
and
preachers
often
looked
on
in
pious
approbation
and
the
church
covered
these
sports
with
the
mantle
of
her
approval
but
was
ready
to
excommunicate
any
one
who
should
dance
promiscuous
dancing
was
the
fiery
dragon
which
the
church
went
out
to
slay
only
its
death
could
save
her
from
a
fit
of
choler
which
might
be
fatal
unless
indeed
the
dancing
were
sanctified
by
promiscuous
kissing
if
men
and
women
danced
together
without
kissing
they
were
in
immediate
danger
of
eternal
damnation
but
with
plenty
of
kissing
and
rude
wrestling
to
overcome
the
delicacy
of
women
who
objected
to
such
desecration
the
church
gave
her
blessing
to
the
quadrille
my
protest
against
these
plays
had
given
offense
and
i
chose
to
avoid
them
but
one
evening
the
host
begged
me
to
remain
saying
he
would
see
that
i
was
not
annoyed
and
would
himself
take
me
home
the
frolic
was
only
begun
when
he
came
and
asked
permission
to
introduce
a
gentleman
saying
if
you
do
not
treat
him
well
i
will
never
forgive
you
there
was
no
need
of
this
caution
for
he
presented
a
man
whose
presence
made
me
feel
that
i
was
a
very
little
girl
and
should
have
been
at
home
he
was
over
six
feet
tall
well
formed
and
strongly
built
with
black
hair
and
eyes
a
long
face
and
heavy
black
whiskers
he
was
handsomely
dressed
and
his
manner
that
of
a
grave
and
reverend
seignior
a
russian
count
in
a
new
york
drawing
room
then
when
counts
were
few
could
not
have
seemed
more
foreign
than
this
man
in
that
village
parlor
less
than
two
miles
from
the
place
of
his
birth
he
was
the
son
of
the
old
revolutionary
soldier
with
the
unpronouncable
name
who
lived
in
the
beautiful
valley
this
i
knew
at
once
but
did
not
for
some
time
realize
that
it
was
he
who
rescued
us
from
the
black
waters
on
that
dark
night
carried
us
to
safety
and
light
and
left
us
again
in
darkness
this
incident
so
much
to
me
he
never
could
distinguish
among
the
many
times
he
had
helped
olever
and
his
seminary
girls
out
of
scrapes
and
he
never
spoke
of
these
adventures
without
that
same
laugh
which
i
noticed
when
father
olever
thanked
him
he
had
elected
me
as
his
wife
some
years
before
this
evening
and
had
not
kept
it
secret
had
been
assured
his
choice
was
presumptuous
but
came
and
took
possession
of
his
prospective
property
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
understood
his
business
i
next
saw
him
on
horseback
and
this
man
of
giant
strength
in
full
suit
of
black
riding
a
large
spirited
black
horse
became
my
black
knight
my
sister
hated
him
and
my
mother
doubted
him
or
rather
doubted
the
propriety
of
my
receiving
visits
from
him
his
family
were
the
leading
methodists
of
the
township
his
father
had
donated
land
and
built
a
which
took
his
name
and
his
house
was
the
headquarters
of
traveling
preachers
there
was
a
ground
on
the
farm
his
mother
lived
without
sin
prayed
aloud
and
shouted
in
meeting
while
the
income
and
energy
of
the
family
were
expended
in
propagating
a
faith
which
we
believed
false
a
marriage
with
him
would
be
incongruous
and
bring
misery
to
both
these
objections
he
overruled
by
saying
he
was
not
a
member
of
any
church
would
never
interfere
with
my
rights
of
conscience
would
take
or
send
me
to
my
meeting
when
possible
and
expect
me
to
go
sometimes
with
him
he
proposed
going
up
the
allegheny
to
establish
and
if
i
would
go
into
the
woods
with
him
there
should
be
no
trouble
about
religion
so
there
seemed
no
valid
objection
and
two
years
after
our
introduction
we
were
married
on
the
of
november
then
all
was
changed
i
offended
him
the
day
after
by
shedding
tears
when
i
left
home
to
go
for
a
visit
to
his
father
house
and
his
sister
had
told
him
that
i
cried
while
dressing
to
be
married
these
offenses
he
never
forgave
and
concluded
that
since
i
cared
so
little
for
him
he
would
not
leave
his
friends
and
go
up
the
allegheny
with
me
his
services
were
indispensable
at
home
since
his
brother
samuel
had
gone
into
business
for
himself
and
the
next
brother
william
was
not
seventeen
and
could
not
take
charge
of
the
farm
and
mills
his
mother
was
ready
to
take
me
into
the
family
although
the
house
was
not
large
enough
to
accommodate
us
comfortably
the
old
shop
in
the
yard
could
be
fitted
up
for
a
i
could
teach
and
he
could
manage
the
estate
in
this
change
he
but
followed
that
impulse
which
led
the
men
of
england
centuries
ago
to
enact
that
marriage
annuls
all
previous
contracts
between
the
parties
and
which
now
leads
men
in
all
civilized
countries
to
preserve
such
statutes
it
is
an
old
adage
all
is
fair
in
love
as
in
war
but
i
thought
not
of
general
laws
and
only
felt
a
private
grievance
by
a
further
change
of
plan
i
was
to
get
religion
and
preach
wesley
made
the
great
innovation
of
calling
women
to
the
pulpit
and
although
it
had
afterwards
been
closed
to
them
generally
there
were
still
women
who
did
preach
while
all
were
urged
to
take
part
in
public
worship
my
husband
had
been
converted
after
our
engagement
and
shortly
before
our
marriage
and
was
quite
zealous
he
thought
me
wonderfully
wise
and
that
i
might
bring
souls
to
christ
if
i
only
would
i
quoted
paul
let
women
keep
silence
in
churches
and
learn
of
their
husbands
at
home
he
replied
wives
obey
your
husbands
he
laughed
at
the
thought
of
my
learning
from
him
and
said
what
shall
i
teach
you
will
you
come
to
the
mill
and
let
me
show
you
how
to
put
a
log
on
the
carriage
it
was
a
very
earnest
discussion
and
the
bible
was
on
both
sides
but
i
followed
the
lead
of
my
church
which
taught
me
to
be
silent
he
quoted
his
preachers
who
were
in
league
with
him
to
get
me
to
give
myself
to
the
lord
help
them
save
souls
by
calling
on
men
everywhere
to
repent
but
i
was
obstinate
i
would
not
get
religion
would
not
preach
would
not
live
in
the
house
with
his
mother
and
stayed
with
my
own
his
younger
brothers
came
regularly
to
me
for
lessons
with
my
sister
and
i
added
two
idiotic
children
bound
to
his
sister
husband
to
whose
darkened
minds
i
found
the
key
hidden
from
other
teachers
his
brothers
i
adopted
from
the
first
in
place
of
the
one
i
had
lost
and
they
repaid
my
love
in
kind
but
books
soon
appeared
as
an
entering
wedge
between
their
souls
and
religion
which
formed
the
entire
mental
pabulum
of
the
family
i
believe
there
was
not
at
that
time
a
member
of
the
pittsburg
conference
who
was
a
college
graduate
few
who
had
even
a
good
common
school
education
while
two
of
those
who
preached
in
our
meetinghouse
and
were
frequent
guests
in
the
family
were
unable
to
read
my
husband
father
was
old
and
feeble
and
had
devised
his
property
to
his
wife
to
be
divided
at
her
death
between
her
sons
my
husband
as
her
agent
would
come
into
possession
of
the
whole
and
they
thought
i
might
object
to
the
prophet
chamber
but
it
required
no
worldly
motive
to
stimulate
these
fiery
zealots
to
save
a
sinner
from
the
toils
of
calvinism
it
is
probable
many
of
them
would
have
laid
down
his
life
for
his
religion
and
when
they
got
on
the
track
of
a
sinner
they
pursued
him
as
eagerly
as
ever
an
english
parson
did
a
fox
but
it
was
to
save
not
to
kill
in
these
hot
pursuits
they
did
not
stand
on
ceremony
and
in
my
case
found
a
subject
that
would
not
run
my
kith
and
kin
had
died
at
the
stake
bearing
testimony
against
popery
and
prelacy
had
fought
on
those
fields
where
scotchmen
charged
in
solid
columns
singing
psalms
and
though
i
was
wax
at
all
other
points
i
was
granite
on
the
solemn
league
and
covenant
with
the
convictions
of
others
i
did
not
interfere
but
when
attacked
would
render
a
reason
my
assailants
denounced
theological
seminaries
as
informed
me
that
neither
black
nor
any
of
his
congregation
ever
had
religion
and
that
only
by
getting
it
could
any
one
be
saved
my
husband
became
proud
of
my
defense
and
the
boys
grew
disrespectful
to
their
religious
guides
their
mother
became
anxious
about
their
souls
so
the
efforts
for
my
conversion
were
redoubled
from
the
first
the
preachers
disapproved
of
my
being
permitted
to
go
to
my
meeting
and
especially
to
my
husband
accompanying
me
he
refused
to
go
on
the
ground
that
he
had
not
been
invited
to
commune
and
as
i
sank
in
the
deep
waters
of
affliction
i
did
so
need
the
pulpit
teachings
of
my
old
pastor
which
seemed
to
lift
me
and
set
my
feet
upon
a
rock
one
day
i
walked
the
seven
miles
and
back
when
the
family
carriage
went
to
take
two
preachers
to
an
appointment
three
horses
stood
in
the
old
stone
barn
and
my
husband
at
home
with
his
mother
this
gave
great
offense
as
the
advertisement
of
a
grievance
and
was
never
repeated
during
all
my
childhood
and
youth
i
had
been
spoiled
by
much
love
if
love
can
spoil
i
was
by
nature
and
on
principle
believed
in
the
power
of
good
forbearance
generosity
helpful
service
would
should
must
win
my
new
friends
to
love
me
getting
me
into
the
house
with
my
was
so
important
a
part
of
the
plan
of
salvation
that
to
effect
it
i
was
left
without
support
or
compensation
for
my
services
as
teacher
tailor
for
my
husband
family
he
visited
me
once
or
twice
a
week
and
ignored
my
mother
presence
while
she
felt
that
in
this
as
in
any
conflict
only
god
could
help
me
and
stood
aloof
to
me
the
sun
was
darkened
and
the
moon
refused
her
light
i
knew
that
jealous
god
who
claimed
the
supreme
love
of
his
creatures
was
scourging
me
for
making
an
idol
and
bowing
down
before
it
for
loving
my
husband
i
knew
it
was
all
just
and
clung
to
the
almighty
arm
with
the
old
cry
though
he
slay
me
yet
will
i
trust
in
him
to
my
husband
i
clung
with
like
tenacity
and
could
not
admit
that
my
suffering
was
through
any
fault
of
his
the
summer
after
my
marriage
mother
went
for
a
long
visit
to
butler
and
left
us
in
possession
of
her
house
my
husband
bought
a
village
property
including
a
shop
employed
a
workman
and
sent
him
to
board
with
me
he
also
made
some
additions
to
a
dwelling
on
it
that
we
might
go
there
to
live
and
the
workmen
boarded
with
me
while
my
furnished
provisions
and
came
or
sent
a
daughter
to
see
that
i
did
not
waste
them
her
reproofs
were
in
the
form
of
suggestions
and
she
sought
to
please
me
by
saying
she
had
allowed
james
to
get
certain
things
for
me
but
he
did
not
visit
me
any
oftener
than
when
mother
was
at
home
and
when
she
returned
in
the
autumn
the
potatoes
were
frozen
in
the
ground
the
apples
on
the
trees
and
the
cow
stood
starving
at
the
stable
door
then
i
learned
that
i
had
been
expected
to
secure
the
fall
crops
on
mother
lot
and
this
was
not
unreasonable
for
i
had
married
a
pennsylvania
farmer
and
their
wives
and
sisters
and
daughters
did
such
work
often
while
the
men
folks
pitched
horseshoes
to
work
off
their
surplus
vitality
lack
of
strength
was
no
reason
why
a
woman
should
fail
in
her
duty
for
when
one
fell
at
her
post
there
was
always
another
to
take
her
place
up
to
this
time
mother
had
left
me
to
settle
my
troubles
but
now
she
told
me
i
must
turn
and
demand
justice
that
generosity
was
more
than
thrown
away
that
i
never
could
live
with
my
husband
and
bear
his
neglect
and
unkindness
and
that
of
his
family
i
must
leave
him
defend
myself
or
die
that
i
should
have
been
expected
to
gather
apples
and
dig
potatoes
filled
her
with
indignation
she
advised
me
to
stay
with
her
and
refuse
to
see
him
but
i
shuddered
to
think
it
had
come
to
this
in
one
short
year
and
felt
that
all
would
yet
be
well
so
i
went
to
live
in
the
house
he
provided
for
me
his
mother
furnished
my
supplies
and
he
came
once
a
week
to
see
me
here
let
me
say
that
in
my
twenty
years
of
married
life
my
conflicts
were
all
spiritual
that
there
never
was
a
time
when
my
husband
strong
right
arm
would
not
be
tempered
to
infantile
gentleness
to
tend
me
in
illness
or
when
he
hesitated
to
throw
himself
between
me
and
danger
over
streams
and
other
places
impassible
to
me
he
carried
me
but
could
not
understand
how
so
frail
a
thing
could
be
so
obstinate
chapter
viii
fitting
myself
into
my
age
during
all
my
girlhood
i
saw
no
pictures
no
art
gallery
no
studio
but
had
learned
to
feel
great
contempt
for
my
own
efforts
at
a
traveling
artist
stopped
in
wilkinsburg
and
painted
some
portraits
we
visited
his
studio
and
a
new
world
opened
to
me
up
to
that
time
portrait
painting
had
seemed
as
inaccessible
as
the
moon
a
sublimity
i
no
more
thought
of
reaching
than
a
star
but
when
i
saw
a
portrait
on
the
easel
a
palette
of
paints
and
some
brushes
i
was
at
home
in
a
new
world
at
the
head
of
a
long
vista
of
faces
which
i
must
paint
but
the
new
aspiration
was
another
secret
to
keep
bard
the
made
me
a
stretcher
and
with
a
yard
of
unbleached
muslin
some
tacks
and
white
lead
i
made
a
canvas
in
the
shop
were
white
lead
lampblack
king
yellow
and
red
lead
with
oil
and
turpentine
i
watched
bard
mix
paints
and
concluded
i
wanted
brown
years
before
i
heard
of
brown
umber
so
i
got
umber
and
some
brushes
and
begun
my
husband
portrait
i
hid
it
when
he
was
there
or
i
heard
any
one
coming
and
once
blistered
it
badly
trying
to
dry
it
before
the
fire
so
that
it
was
a
very
rough
work
but
it
was
a
portrait
a
daub
a
likeness
and
the
hand
was
his
hand
and
no
other
the
figure
was
correct
and
the
position
in
the
chair
and
from
the
moment
i
began
it
i
felt
i
had
found
my
vocation
what
did
i
care
for
preachers
and
theological
arguments
what
matter
who
sent
me
my
bread
or
whether
i
had
any
what
matter
for
anything
so
long
as
i
had
a
canvas
and
some
paints
with
that
long
perspective
of
faces
and
figures
crowding
up
and
begging
to
be
painted
the
face
of
every
one
i
knew
was
there
with
every
line
and
varying
expression
and
in
each
i
seemed
to
read
the
inner
life
in
the
outer
form
oh
how
they
plead
with
me
what
graceful
lines
and
gorgeous
colors
floated
around
me
i
forgot
god
and
did
not
know
it
forgot
philosophy
and
did
not
care
to
remember
it
but
alas
i
forgot
to
get
bard
dinner
and
although
i
forgot
to
be
hungry
i
had
no
reason
to
suppose
he
did
he
would
willingly
have
gone
hungry
rather
than
give
any
one
trouble
but
i
had
neglected
a
duty
not
only
once
did
i
do
this
but
again
and
again
the
fire
went
out
or
the
bread
ran
over
in
the
pans
while
i
painted
and
dreamed
my
conscience
began
to
trouble
me
housekeeping
was
woman
sphere
although
i
had
never
then
heard
the
words
for
no
woman
had
gotten
out
of
it
to
be
hounded
back
but
i
knew
my
place
and
scorned
to
leave
it
i
tried
to
think
i
could
paint
without
neglect
of
duty
it
did
not
occur
to
me
that
painting
was
a
duty
for
a
married
woman
had
the
passion
seized
me
before
marriage
no
other
love
could
have
come
between
me
and
art
but
i
felt
that
it
was
too
late
as
my
life
was
already
devoted
to
another
object
housekeeping
it
was
a
hard
struggle
i
tried
to
compromise
but
experience
soon
deprived
me
of
that
hope
for
to
paint
was
to
be
oblivious
of
all
other
things
in
my
doubt
i
met
one
of
those
newspaper
paragraphs
with
which
men
are
wont
to
pelt
women
into
subjection
a
man
does
not
marry
an
artist
but
a
housekeeper
this
fitted
my
case
and
my
doom
was
sealed
i
put
away
my
brushes
resolutely
crucified
my
divine
gift
and
while
it
hung
writhing
on
the
cross
spent
my
best
years
and
powers
cooking
cabbage
a
servant
of
servants
shall
she
be
must
have
been
spoken
of
women
not
negroes
friends
have
tried
to
comfort
me
by
the
assurance
that
my
has
been
better
done
by
the
pen
than
it
could
have
been
with
the
pencil
but
this
can
not
be
i
have
never
cared
for
literary
fame
have
avoided
rather
than
sought
it
have
enjoyed
the
abuse
of
the
press
more
than
its
praise
have
held
my
pen
with
a
feeling
of
contempt
for
its
feebleness
and
never
could
be
so
occupied
with
it
as
to
forget
a
domestic
duty
while
i
have
never
visited
a
picture
gallery
but
i
have
bowed
in
deep
repentance
for
the
betrayal
of
a
trust
where
are
the
pictures
i
should
have
given
to
the
world
where
my
record
of
the
wrongs
and
outrages
of
my
age
of
the
sorrows
and
joys
the
trials
and
triumphs
that
should
have
been
written
amid
autumn
and
sunset
glories
in
the
eloquent
faces
and
speaking
forms
which
have
everywhere
presented
themselves
begging
to
be
interpreted
why
have
i
never
put
on
canvas
one
pair
of
those
pleading
eyes
in
which
are
garnered
the
woes
of
centuries
is
that
christianity
which
has
so
long
said
to
of
the
race
thou
shalt
not
use
any
gift
of
the
creator
if
it
be
not
approved
by
thy
brother
and
unto
man
not
god
thou
shalt
ever
turn
and
ask
wilt
thou
have
me
to
do
it
was
not
only
my
which
must
be
sacrificed
to
my
duty
as
a
wife
but
my
literary
tastes
must
go
with
it
the
husband
is
the
head
of
the
wife
to
be
head
he
must
be
superior
an
uncultivated
husband
could
not
be
the
superior
of
a
cultivated
wife
i
knew
from
the
first
that
his
education
had
been
limited
but
thought
the
defect
would
be
easily
remedied
as
he
had
good
abilities
but
i
discovered
he
had
no
love
for
books
his
spiritual
guides
derided
human
learning
and
depended
on
inspiration
my
knowledge
stood
in
the
way
of
my
salvation
and
i
must
be
that
odious
thing
a
superior
wife
or
stop
my
progress
for
to
be
and
appear
were
the
same
thing
i
must
be
the
mate
of
the
man
i
had
chosen
and
if
he
would
not
come
to
my
level
i
must
go
to
his
so
i
gave
up
study
and
for
years
did
not
read
one
page
in
any
book
save
the
bible
my
religions
convictions
i
could
not
change
but
all
other
differences
should
disappear
mother
moved
to
the
city
in
the
spring
of
and
my
health
was
rapidly
failing
i
had
rebelled
against
my
returned
her
supplies
and
refused
to
receive
anything
from
her
this
brought
on
a
fearful
crisis
in
which
my
husband
threatened
suicide
but
i
was
firm
and
he
concluded
to
rent
the
mills
and
take
me
away
this
he
did
his
father
lived
but
a
few
months
and
died
on
the
second
anniversary
of
our
marriage
he
lies
buried
in
the
ground
he
donated
as
god

with
only
this
inscription
at
his
head
john
swisshelm
aged
no
sign
that
he
was
one
of
the
world
heroes
yet
when
our
revolution
broke
out
his
parents
had
but
two
children
the
oldest
enlisted
and
was
killed
when
john
caught
up
his
rifle
took
his
place
and
kept
it
until
the
close
of
the
war
he
spent
the
winter
in

and
once
in
the
darkest
time
discovered
washington
on
his
knees
in
a
lonely
thicket
praying
aloud
for
his
country
this
gave
him
hope
when
hope
was
dead
and
he
followed
his
commander
across
the
jerseys
one
of
the
two
thousand
who
wrote
in
blood
from
their
shoeless
feet

chapter
ix
habitations
of
horrid
age
on
the
of
june
the
white
frost
lay
on
the
west
side
of
pittsburg
roofs
as
we
steamed
away
from
her
wharf
bound
for
louisville
where
my
husband
proposed
going
into
a
business
already
established
by
his
brother
samuel
on
the
boat
all
the
way
down
the
river
the
general
topic
of
conversation
was
the
contrast
between
the
desolate
shores
of
kentucky
and
the
smiling
plenty
of
the
opposite
bank
but
louisville
was
largely
settled
by
northern
people
and
was
to
prove
an
oasis
in
the
desert
of
slavery
it
lay
at
the
head
of
the
falls
of
the
ohio
and
the
general
government
had
lately
expended
large
sums
in
building
a
canal
around
them
henry
clay
was
in
the
zenith
of
his
power
slavery
held
possession
of
the
national
resources
louisville
might
count
on
favors
and
she
was
to
be
queen
city
of
the
west
there
was
an
aspiring
little
place
which
fancied
itself
a
rival
a
little
without
natural
advantages
called
cincinnati
where
they
killed
hogs
but
it
was
quite
absurd
to
think
of
her
competing
with
the
great
metropolis
at
the
head
of
the
canal
i
was
quite
surprised
to
find
there
were
a
good
many
houses
and
folks
in
cincinnati
but
our
boat
did
not
stop
long
and
we
soon
reached
our
eldorado
before
we
effected
a
landing
at
the
crowded
wharf
i
fell
to
wondering
if
a
pittsburg
drayman
could
take
a
louisville
dray
its
load
its
three
horses
and
ragged
driver
pile
them
on
his
dray
and
with
his
one
horse
take
them
to
their
destination
and
i
thought
he
could
samuel
met
us
and
as
we
went
in
a
hack
to
the
boarding
place
he
had
engaged
i
wondered
what
had
happened
that
so
many
men
were
off
work
in
the
middle
of
the
forenoon
who
or
what
could
they
be
those
fellows
in
shining
black
broadcloth
each
with
a
hat
on
the
side
of
his
head
his
thumbs
in
the
armholes
of
a
satin
vest
displaying
a
wonderful
glimmer
of
gold
chain
and
diamond
stud
balancing
himself
first
on
his
heels
and
then
on
his
toes
as
he
rolled
a
cigar
from
one
side
of
his
mouth
to
the
other
how
did
they
come
to
be
standing
around
on
corners
and
doorsteps
by
the
hundred
like
crows
on
a
cornfield
fence
it
was
some
time
before
i
learned
that
this
was
the
advance
guard
of
a
great
army
of
which
stretched
away
back
to
the
atlantic
and
around
the
shores
of
the
gulf
of
mexico
and
that
they
were
out
on
duty
as
a
staring
brigade
whose
business
it
was
to
insult
every
woman
who
ventured
on
the
street
without
a
male
protector
by
a
stare
so
lascivious
as
could
not
be
imagined
on
american
free
soil
i
learned
that
they
all
lived
in
whole
or
in
part
by
the
sale
of
their
own
children
and
the
labor
of
the
mothers
extorted
by
the
lash
i
came
to
know
one
veteran
whose
entire
support
came
from
the
natural
increase
and
wages
of
nineteen
women
one
of
whom
a
girl
of
eighteen
lived
with
him
in
a
fashionable
waited
on
him
at
table
slept
in
his
room
and
of
whose
yearly
wages
one
hundred
and
dollars
were
credited
on
his
board
bill
i
learned
that
none
of
the
shapely
hands
displayed
on
the
black
vests
had
ever
used
other
implement
of
toil
than
a
pistol
or
that
any
other
tool
would
ruin
the
reputation
of
the
owner
of
the
taper
digits
but
they
did
not
lose
caste
by
horsewhipping
the
old
mammys
from
whose
bosoms
they
had
drawn
life
in
infancy
our
was
on
walnut
street
one
block
west
of
the
theatre
and
looked
toward
the
river
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
street
stood
a
brick
house
always
closed
except
when
a
negress
opened
and
dusted
the
rooms
i
never
saw
sadness
or
sorrow
until
i
saw
that
face
and
it
did
not
appear
except
about
her
work
or
when
she
emerged
from
a
side
gate
to
call
in
two
mulatto
children
who
sometimes
came
out
on
the
pavement
this
house
belonged
to
a
northern
mudsill
who
kept
a
grocery
and
owned
the
woman
who
was
the
mother
of
five
children
of
whom
he
was
the
father
the
older
two
he
had
sold
one
at
a
time
as
they
became
saleable
or
got
in
his
way
on
the
sale
of
the
first
the
mother
took
on
so
that
he
was
obliged
to
flog
her
almost
to
death
before
she
gave
up
but
he
had
made
her
understand
that
their
children
were
to
be
sold
at
his
convenience
and
that
he
would
not
have
more
than
three
little
niggers
about
the
house
at
one
time
after
that
first
lesson
she
had
been
reasonable
our
hostess
a
kentucky
lady
used
to
lament
the
loss
of
two
boys
two
of
the
beautifulest
boys
they
were
the
sons
of
her
bachelor
uncle
who
had
had
a
passion
for
liza
one
of
his
father
slaves
a
tall
handsome
quadroon
who
rejected
his
suit
and
was
in
love
with
jo
a
fellow
slave
to
punish
both
the
young
master
had
jo
tied
up
and
lashed
until
he
fainted
while
liza
was
held
so
that
she
must
witness
the
torture
until
insensibility
came
to
her
relief
this
was
done
three
times
when
jo
was
sold
and
liza
herself
bound
to
the
and
lashed
until
she
yielded
and
became
the
mother
of
those
two
beautiful
boys
but
added
her
biographer
she
never
smiled
after
jo
was
sold
took
consumption
and
died
when
her
youngest
boy
was
two
months
old
they
were
the
beautifulest
boys
i
ever
laid
eyes
on
and
uncle
sot
great
store
by
them
he
could
bear
to
have
them
out
of
his
sight
and
always
said
he
would
give
them
to
me
he
would
have
done
it
i
know
if
he
had
made
a
will
but
he
took
sick
sudden
raving
crazy
and
never
got
his
senses
for
one
minute
it
often
took
three
men
to
hold
him
on
the
bed
he
thought
he
saw
jo
and
liza
and
died
cursing
and
raving
she
paused
to
wipe
away
a
tear
and
added
the
boys
were
sold
down
south
maybe
your
way
up
north
is
best
after
all
i
never
knew
a
cruel
master
die
happy
they
are
sure
to
be
killed
or
die
dreadful
she
had
an
old
rheumatic
cook
martha
who
seldom
left
her
basement
kitchen
except
when
she
went
to
her
baptist
meeting
but
for
hours
and
hours
she
crooned
melodies
of
that
hope
within
her
of
a
better
and
a
happier
world
she
had
a
severe
attack
of
acute
inflammation
of
the
eyelids
which
forcibly
closed
her
eyes
and
kept
them
closed
then
she
refused
to
work
her
wages
one
hundred
and
dollars
a
year
were
paid
to
her
owner
a
woman
and
these
went
on
so
her
employer
sent
for
her
owner
and
i
as
an
abolitionist
was
summoned
to
the
conference
that
i
might
learn
to
pity
the
sorrows
of
mistresses
and
understand
the
deceitfulness
of
slaves
the
injured
owner
sat
in
the
shaded
parlor
in
a
satin
dress
that
might
almost
have
stood
upright
without
assistance
from
the
flesh
or
bones
inside
with
the
dress
was
combined
a
mass
of
lace
and
jewelry
that
represented
a
large
amount
of
money
and
the
mass
as
it
sat
there
and
as
i
recall
it
has
made
costly
attire
odious
this
bedizzoned
martyr
this
costumer
advertisement
sat
and
fanned
as
she
recounted
her
grievances
her
entire
allowance
for
personal
expenses
was
the
wages
of
nine
women
and
her
husband
would
not
give
her
another
dollar
they
knowing
her
necessities
were
so
ungrateful
nobody
could
think
how
ungrateful
but
in
all
her
sorrows
martha
was
her
crowning
grief
she
had
had
two
husbands
and
had
behaved
so
badly
when
the
first
was
sold
then
every
time
one
of
her
thirteen
children
were
disposed
of
she
did
take
on
so
nobody
could
imagine
how
she
took
on
once
the
gentle
mistress
had
been
compelled
to
send
her
to
the
workhouse
and
have
her
whipped
by
the
constable
and
that
cost
fifty
cents
but
really
this
martyr
and
her
husband
had
grown
weary
of
flogging
martha
one
hated
so
to
send
a
servant
to
the
public
it
looked
like
cruelty
did
cruelty
lacerate
the
feelings
of
refined
people
and
it
was
so
ungrateful
in
martha
and
all
the
rest
of
them
to
torture
this
fine
lady
in
this
rough
way
as
to
martha
ingratitude
there
could
be
no
doubt
for
to
this
our
hostess
testified
and
called
me
to
witness
that
she
had
sent
her
a
cup
of
tea
every
day
since
she
had
complained
of
being
sick
yes
a
cup
of
tea
with
sugar
in
it
and
yet
the
old
wretch
had
not
gone
to
work
when
they
had
finished
the
recital
of
their
grievances
they
came
down
to
business
the
owner
would
remit
two
week
wages
after
that
it
was
the
business
of
the
employer
to
pay
them
and
see
that
they
were
earned
if
it
were
necessary
now
to
send
martha
to
the
the
lady
in
satin
would
pay
the
fifty
cents
but
for
any
future
flogging
the
lady
in
lawn
must
be
responsible
to
the
city
of
louisville
we
adjourned
to
the
kitchen
where
old
martha
stood
before
her
judge
clutching
the
table
with
her
hard
hands
trembling
in
every
limb
her
eyelids
swollen
out
like
and
offensive
from
neglect
her
white
curls
making
a
border
to
her
red
turban
receiving
her
sentence
without
a
word
as
a
sheep
before
her
shearers
she
was
dumb
opening
not
her
mouth
those
wrinkled
old
lips
from
which
i
had
heard
few
sounds
save
those
of
prayer
and
praise
were
closed
by
a
cruelty
perfectly
incomprehensible
in
its
unconscious
debasement
our
hostess
was
a
leading
member
of
the
fourth
church
the
other
feminine
fiend
a
presbyterian
i
promised
the
lord
then
and
there
that
for
life
it
should
be
my
work
to
bring
deliverance
to
the
captive
and
the
opening
of
the
prison
to
them
that
are
bound
but
all
i
could
do
for
martha
was
to
give
her
such
medical
treatment
as
would
restore
her
sight
and
save
her
from
the
and
this
i
did
while
i
lived
on
that
dark
and
bloody
ground
a
man
was
beaten
to
death
in
an
open
shed
on
the
corner
of
two
public
streets
where
the
sound
of
the
blows
the
curses
of
his
two
tormentors
and
his
shrieks
and
unavailing
prayers
for
mercy
were
continued
a
whole
forenoon
and
sent
the
complaining
air
shuddering
to
the
ears
of
thousands
not
one
of
whom
offered
any
help
a
girl
maria
the
educated
refined
daughter
of
a
kentucky
farmer
was
lashed
by
her
brutal
purchaser
once
and
again
and
again
for
chastity
where
hundreds
who
heard
the
blows
and
shrieks
knew
the
cause
from
that
house
she
was
taken
to
the
and
scourged
by
the
public
executioner
backed
by
the
whole
force
of
the
united
states
government
oh
god
can
this
nation
ever
ever
be
forgiven
for
the
blood
of
her
innocent
children
passing
a
crowded
church
on
a
sabbath
afternoon
i
stepped
in
when
the
preacher
was
descanting
on
the
power
of
religion
and
in
illustration
he
told
of
two
wicked
young
men
in
that
state
who
were
drinking
and
gambling
on
sunday
morning
when
one
said
i
can
lick
the
religion
out
of
any
nigger
the
other
would
bet
one
hundred
dollars
that
he
had
a
nigger
out
of
whom
the
religion
could
not
be
licked
the
bet
was
taken
and
they
adjourned
to
a
yard
this
unique
nigger
was
summoned
and
proved
to
be
a
poor
old
man
his
master
informed
him
he
had
a
bet
on
him
and
the
other
party
commanded
him
to
curse
jesus
on
pain
of
being
flogged
until
he
did
the
old
saint
dropped
on
his
knees
before
his
master
and
plead
for
mercy
saying
massa
massa
i
can
not
curse
jesus
jesus
die
for
me
he
die
for
you
massa
i
no
curse
him
i
no
curse
jesus
the
master
began
to
repent
in
babyhood
he
had
ridden
on
those
old
bowed
shoulders
then
stalwart
and
firm
and
he
proposed
to
draw
the
bet
but
the
other
wanted
sport
and
would
win
the
money
oh
the
horrible
details
that
that
preacher
gave
of
that
day
sport
of
the
lashings
and
faintings
and
revivals
with
washes
of
strong
brine
the
prayers
for
mercy
and
the
recurring
moan
i
no
curse
jesus
massa
i
no
curse
jesus
jesus
die
for
me
massa
i
die
for
jesus
as
the
sun
went
down
jesus
took
him
and
his
merciful
master
had
sold
a
worthless
nigger
for
one
hundred
dollars
but
the
only
point
which
the
preacher
made
was
that
one
in
favor
of
religion
when
it
could
so
support
a
nigger
what
might
it
not
do
for
one
of
the
superior
race
for
months
i
saw
every
day
a
boy
who
could
not
have
been
more
than
ten
years
old
but
who
seemed
to
be
eight
and
who
wore
an
iron
collar
with
four
projections
and
a
hoop
or
bail
up
over
his
head
this
had
been
put
on
him
for
the
crime
of
running
away
and
was
kept
on
to
prevent
a
repetition
of
that
crime
the
master
who
thus
secured
his
property
was
an
elder
in
the
second
presbyterian
church
and
led
the
choir
the
principal
baptist
preacher
owned
and
hired
out
one
hundred
slaves
took
them
himself
to
the
public
mart
and
acted
as
auctioneer
in
disposing
of
their
services
the
time
at
which
this
was
done
was
in
the
christmas
holidays
or
rather
the
last
day
of
the
year
when
the
annual
week
of
respite
ended
a
female
member
of
the
fourth
methodist
church
was
threatened
with
discipline
for
nailing
her
cook
to
the
fence
by
the
ear
with
a
nail
the
preacher
in
charge
witnessed
the
punishment
from
a
back
window
of
his
residence
hundreds
of
others
witnessed
it
called
by
the
shrieks
of
the
victim
and
his
reverence
protested
on
the
ground
that
such
scenes
were
calculated
to
injure
the
church
chapter
kentucky
contempt
for
age
to
a
white
woman
in
louisville
work
was
a
dire
disgrace
and
one
sabbath
four
of
us
sat
suffering
from
thirst
with
the
pump
across
the
street
when
i
learned
that
for
me
to
go
for
a
pitcher
of
water
would
be
so
great
a
disgrace
to
the
house
as
to
demand
my
instant
expulsion
i
grew
tired
doing
nothing
my
husband
business
did
not
prosper
and
i
went
to
a
dressmaker
and
asked
for
work
she
was
a
new
england
woman
and
after
some
shrewd
questions
exclaimed
my
dear
child
go
home
to
your
mother
what
does
your
husband
mean
does
he
not
know
you
would
be
insulted
at
every
step
if
you
work
for
a
living
go
home
go
home
to
your
mother
i
was
homesick
and
the
kindness
of
the
voice
and
eyes
made
me
cry
i
told
her
i
could
not
leave
my
husband
then
let
him
support
you
or
send
you
home
until
he
can
i
have
seen
too
many
like
you
go
to
destruction
here
go
home
i
said
that
i
could
never
go
to
destruction
but
she
interrupted
me
you
know
nothing
about
it
you
are
a
mere
baby
they
all
thought
as
you
do
go
home
to
your
mother
but
i
never
can
go
to
destruction
no
evil
can
befall
me
for
he
that
keepeth
israel
slumbers
not
nor
sleeps
she
concluded
to
give
me
work
but
said
i
will
send
it
by
a
servant
do
you
come
here
i
never
thrust
my
opinions
on
any
one
but
every
southerner
inquired
concerning
them
and
i
gave
true
answers
there
were
many
boarders
in
the
house
and
one
evening
when
there
were
eighteen
men
in
the
parlor
these
questions
brought
on
a
warm
discussion
when
one
said
you
had
better
take
care
how
you
talk
or
we
will
give
you
a
coat
of
tar
and
feathers
i
agreed
to
accept
such
gratuitous
suit
and
a
mississippi
planter
who
seemed
to
realize
the
situation
said
gently
indeed
madam
it
is
not
safe
for
you
to
talk
as
you
do
when
reminded
of
constitutional
guarantees
for
freedom
of
speech
and
his
enjoyment
of
it
in
my
native
state
he
replied
there
is
no
danger
in
pennsylvania
from
freedom
of
speech
but
if
people
were
allowed
to
talk
as
you
do
here
it
would
overthrow
our
institutions
there
were
mobs
in
the
air
the
mayor
closed
a
on
the
ground
that
in
it
slaves
were
taught
to
read
the
teacher
a
new
england
woman
denied
the
charge
and
claimed
that
only
free
children
had
been
taught
while
slaves
were
orally
instructed
to
obey
their
masters
as
good
presbyterians
who
hoped
to
escape
the
worm
that
never
dies
her
defense
failed
but
seemed
to
establish
the
right
of
free
colored
people
to
a
knowledge
of
the
alphabet
but
there
was
no
school
for
them
and
i
thought
to
establish
one
jerry
wade
the
gault
house
barber
was
a
mulatto
who
had
bought
himself
and
family
and
acquired
considerable
real
estate
in
the
back
of
one
of
his
houses
lived
his
son
with
a
wife
and
little
daughter
we
rented
the
front
and
mother
sent
me
furniture
this
was
highly
genteel
for
it
gave
us
the
appearance
of
owning
slaves
and
olivia
young
wife
represented
herself
as
my
slave
to
bring
her
and
her
child
security
as
a
free
negro
she
labored
under
many
disadvantages
so
begged
me
to
claim
her
in
this
house
i
started
my
school
and
there
were
no
lack
of
pupils
whose
parents
were
able
and
willing
to
pay
for
their
tuition
but
ruffians
stood
before
the
house
and
hooted
at
the
nigger
school
threatening
letters
were
sent
me
and
wade
was
notified
that
his
house
would
be
burned
or
sacked
if
he
permitted
its
use
for
such
purpose
in
one
day
my
pupils
were
all
withdrawn
after
this
i
began
to
make
corsets
it
was
a
joy
to
fit
the
superb
forms
of
kentucky
women
and
my
found
employment
in
it
but
my
husband
did
not
succeed
and
went
down
the
river
a
man
came
to
see
if
i
could
give
work
to
his
for
whose
support
he
could
not
fully
provide
she
was
a
fitzhugh
a
first
virginia
family
her
father
had
died
leaving
a
bankrupt
estate
she
had
learned
dressmaking
and
had
come
with
him
to
louisville
to
find
work
but
she
was
young
and
beautiful
and
he
dare
not
put
her
into
a
shop
but
thought
i
might
protect
her
so
she
came
to
live
with
me
one
evening
an
old
and
wealthy
citizen
called
about
work
i
was
doing
for
his
wife
became
interested
in
me
as
a
stranger
who
had
seen
little
of
louisville
and
tendered
the
use
of
his
and
carriage
to
the
young
lady
and
myself
i
declined
with
thanks
when
he
had
taken
leave
miss
fitzhugh
sprang
to
her
feet
and
with
burning
cheeks
and
flashing
eyes
demanded
to
know
if
i
knew
that
that
man
had
insulted
us
both
i
did
not
know
but
she
did
and
would
tell
edward
who
should
cowhide
him
publicly
i
told
her
that
if
edward
attempted
that
he
would
probably
lose
his
life
and
we
would
certainly
be
dragged
into
a
police
court
even
if
we
had
been
insulted
it
only
proved
that
the
old
man
thought
we
were
like
himself
that
we
were
told
in
the
psalms
that
wicked
men
thought
god
was
like
themselves
and
did
approve
their
sin
and
he
did
not
have
them
cowhided
after
a
moment
reflection
she
sat
down
exclaiming
well
you
are
the
strangest
woman
i
ever
did
see
we
never
again
saw
the
man
and
i
hope
the
incident
helped
the
honest
edward
in
his
loving
task
of
protecting
the
fiery
fitzhugh
my
husband
trip
down
the
river
was
a
failure
and
he
went
back
home
remembering
he
had
heard
me
say
i
could
do
so
much
better
at
if
i
could
buy
goods
at
wholesale
he
sold
his
wilkinsburg
property
and
turned
the
proceeds
into
dry
goods
to
me
this
seemed
very
unwise
but
i
tried
to
make
the
best
of
it
and
we
took
a
business
house
on
fourth
street
i
cut
and
fitted
dresses
and
with
a
could
take
a
measure
from
which
i
could
make
a
perfect
fit
without
trying
on
i
soon
had
more
work
than
i
could
do
and
took
two
new
girls
but
the
goods
were
dead
stock
my
husband
was
out
of
employment
and
tried
to
assist
in
my
business
he
was
out
most
of
the
day
and
in
the
evening
wanted
to
retire
early
i
was
busy
all
day
and
could
not
go
out
alone
after
dark
so
came
to
be
a
prisoner
one
warm
evening
i
was
walking
back
and
forth
in
front
of
our
house
though
i
knew
it
a
great
risk
when
a
man
overtook
me
cleared
his
throat
as
if
to
speak
and
passed
on
to
the
which
had
made
one
limit
of
my
walk
i
did
not
shorten
my
path
and
when
i
came
up
to
the
post
he
again
cleared
his
throat
as
if
to
speak
and
next
time
stepped
out
lifted
his
hat
and
remarked
a
very
pleasant
evening
miss
i
stopped
looked
at
him
and
said
it
is
a
very
pleasant
evening
had
you
not
better
walk
on
and
enjoy
it
he
bowed
low
and
answered
i
beg
your
pardon
madam
i
was
mistaken
pardon
for
what
sir
it
a
very
pleasant
evening
please
to
pass
on
he
did
and
i
walked
till
i
was
tired
thinking
of
all
the
sacrifices
i
had
made
to
be
my
husband
housekeeper
and
keep
myself
in
sphere
and
here
was
the
outcome
i
was
degrading
him
from
his
position
of
if
it
was
my
duty
to
keep
his
house
it
must
be
his
to
find
me
a
house
to
keep
and
this
life
must
end
i
would
go
with
him
to
the
poorest
cabin
but
he
must
be
the
head
of
the
matrimonial
firm
he
should
not
be
my
business
assistant
i
would
not
be
captain
with
him
for
lieutenant

to
extricate
myself
i
did
not
see
but
extricated

would

his

in

of
his

and
feet
spread
like
the
collossus

rhodes
this
new
use
for
pennsylvania
muscle
seemed
to
strike
my
husband
as
infinitely
amusing
for
he
burst
out
laughing
and
informed
the
gentleman
that
he
did
not
follow
the
profession
of
whipping
women
and
must
decline
his
offer
but
i
wanted
to
be
back
on
free
soil
out
of
an
atmosphere
which
killed
all
manhood
and
furnished
as
a
substitute
for
men
chapter
xi
age
during
the
late
spring
and
early
summer
my
letters
from
home
spoke
often
of
mother
failing
health
and
in
july
one
came
from
her
saying
her
disease
had
been
pronounced
cancer
and
bidding
me
come
to
her
the
same
mail
brought
a
letter
from
joseph
gazzam
telling
me
she
was
certainly
on
her
and
adding
let
nothing
prevent
your
coming
to
your
mother
at
once
i
was
hurt
by
this
call
was
i
such
a
monster
that
this
old
family
friend
thought
it
necessary
to
urge
me
to
go
to
my
dying
mother
stunned
and
stupified
with
grief
i
packed
my
trunk
my
husband
came
in
at
noon
and
i
handed
him
the
letters
he
read
them
and
expressed
surprise
and
sorrow
and
i
told
him
to
hurry
to
the
wharf
and
see
when
the
first
boat
started
he
thought
i
should
not
go
until
i
heard
again
it
might
not
be
so
bad
then
after
reflecting
said
why
go
at
all
if
there
was
no
hope
of
what
use
could
i
be
if
there
was
hope
he
would
agree
to
my
going
but
as
there
was
none
he
must
object
in
fact
he
did
not
see
how
i
could
think
of
leaving
him
with
those
goods
on
his
hands
how
could
i
be
so
ready
to
drop
all
and
not
think
of
the
consequences
for
what
could
he
do
with
that
stock
of
dry
goods
my
mother
pretended
to
be
a
christian
but
would
take
me
away
from
my
duty
i
too
read
the
bible
but
paid
little
heed
to
its
teachings
he
brought
that
book
and
read
all
of
paul
directions
to
wives
but
rested
his
case
on
ephesians
v
wives
submit
yourselves
unto
your
own
husbands
as
unto
the
lord
for
the
husband
is
head
of
the
wife
even
as
christ
is
head
of
the
church
therefore
as
the
church
is
subject
unto
christ
so
let
the
wives
be
to
their
own
husbands
in
everything
while
he
continued
his
comments
i
buried
my
head
in
pillows
saying
lord
what
wilt
thou
have
me
to
do
milton
epitomized
paul
when
he
made
eve
say
to
adam
be
god
thy
law
thou
mine
but
was
that
the
mind
and
will
of
god
had
he
transferred
his
claim
to
the
obedience
of
half
the
human
family
was
every
husband
god
to
his
wife
would
wives
appear
in
the
general
judgment
at
all
or
if
they
did
would
they
hand
in
a
schedule
of
marital
commands
if
the
passage
meant
anything
it
meant
this
one
might
as
well
try
to
be
and
not
to
be
at
the
same
time
as
own
allegiance
to
god
and
the
same
allegiance
to
man
i
was
either
god
subject
or
i
was
not
if
i
was
not
i
owed
him
no
obedience
christ
as
head
of
the
church
was
her
absolute
lawgiver
and
thus
saith
the
lord
was
all
she
dare
demand
was
i
to
obey
my
husband
in
that
way
if
so
i
had
no
business
with
the
moral
law
or
any
other
law
save
his
commands
christian
england
had
taken
this
view
and
enacted
that
a
wife
should
not
be
punished
for
any
crime
committed
by
command
or
in
presence
of
her
husband
because
being
altogether
subject
to
him
she
had
no
will
of
her
own
but
this
position
was
soon
abandoned
and
this
passage
stamped
as
spurious
every
christian
church
had
so
stamped
it
for
all
encouraged
wives
to
join
their
communion
with
or
without
the
consent
of
their
husbands
thousands
of
female
martyrs
had
sealed
their
testimony
with
their
blood
opposing
the
authority
of
their
husbands
and
had
been
honored
by
the
church
as
for
me
i
must
take
that
passage
alone
for
my
bible
or
expunge
it
then
and
there
i
cast
it
from
me
forever
as
being
no
part
of
divine
law
and
thus
unconsciously
took
the
first
step
in
breaking
through
a
faith
in
plenary
inspiration
i
next
turned
to
the
book
in
general
for
guidance
wives
obey
your
husbands
children
obey
your
parents
honor
thy
father
and
thy
mother
what
a
labyrinth
of
irreconcilable
contradictions
god
in
nature
spoke
with
no
uncertain
sound
go
home
to
your
mother
and
my
choice
was
made
while
my
husband
talked
i
said
that
if
he
did
not
see
about
a
boat
i
would
when
he
told
me
that
he
had
a
legal
right
to
detain
me
and
would
exercise
it
i
assured
him
the
attempt
would
be
as
dangerous
as
useless
for
i
was
going
to
pittsburg
he
went
out
promising
to
engage
my
passage
but
staid
so
long
that
i
went
to
the
wharf
where
respectable
women
were
not
seen
alone
saw
a
boat
with
a
flag
out
for
pittsburg
engaged
a
berth
and
so
left
louisville
chapter

the
valley
of
the
shadow
of
age
mother
was
suffering
when
i
reached
her
as
i
had
not
dreamed
of
after
a
consultation
drs
gazzam
and
fahnestock
thought
she
could
not
live
more
than
four
weeks
but
spear
said
she
might
linger
three
months
this
blanched
the
cheek
of
each
one
three
months
of
such
unremitting
pain
steadily
on
the
increase
was
appalling
but
mother
faced
the
prospect
without
a
murmur
willing
to
bear
by
god
grace
what
he
should
inflict
and
to
wait
his
good
time
for
deliverance
i
was
filled
with
for
i
should
have
been
with
her
months
before
in
a
few
days
my
and
one
of
her
daughters
came
to
see
how
long
i
proposed
to
stay
why
i
had
left
james
with
the
goods
and
when
i
would
go
and
take
charge
of
them
they
had
had
a
letter
from
him
and
he
was
in
great
trouble
she
was
gentle
and
grave
inquired
minutely
about
our
nursing
but
thought
it
expensive
dwelt
at
length
on
the
folly
of
spending
time
and
money
in
caring
for
the
sick
when
recovery
was
impossible
mother
could
not
see
them
and
they
were
offended
for
they
proposed
helping
to
take
care
of
her
that
i
might
return
to
my
duty
some
time
after
the
visit
of
my
her
who
was
a
and
a
man
of
prominence
in
the
community
came
with
solemn
aspect
took
my
hand
sighed
and
said
i
heard
you
had
left
james
with
the
goods
here
he
sighed
again
wagged
his
head
and
added
but
i
could
believe
it
and
without
another
word
turned
and
walked
away
they
chose
to
regard
mother
illness
as
a
personal
grievance
the
way
of
the
transgressor
is
hard
and
she
having
sinned
against
the
saints
must
bear
her
iniquity
and
thus
suffer
the
just
reward
of
her
deeds
i
had
frequent
letters
from
my
husband
and
he
was
waiting
on
the
wharf
watching
every
boat
for
my
appearance
i
told
him
before
leaving
louisville
that
i
never
would
return
never
again
would
try
to
live
in
a
slave
state
and
advised
him
to
sell
the
goods
at
auction
and
with
the
money
start
a
sawmill
up
the
allegheny
river
and
i
would
go
to
him
this
advice
he
resented
at
length
he
grew
tired
waiting
and
came
for
me
it
is
neither
possible
nor
necessary
here
to
describe
the
trouble
which
ensued
but
i
would
not
nor
did
not
leave
mother
and
she
at
last
remembered
the
protection
to
which
she
was
entitled
by
the
city
government
with
all
mother
courage
her
moans
were
heartbreaking
no
opiate
then
known
could
bring
one
of
any
sleep
in
which
they
ceased
and
in
her
waking
hours
the
burden
of
her
woe
found
vent
in
a
low
refrain
my
father
is
it
not
enough
our
principal
care
was
to
guard
her
from
noise
the
click
of
a
knife
or
spoon
on
a
plate
or
cup
in
the
adjoining
room
sent
a
thrill
of
pain
to
her
nerve
centres
only
two
friends
were
gentle
enough
to
aid
elizabeth
and
me
in
nursing
her
as
she
murmured
constantly
if
my
husband
were
only
here
she
could
bear
no
voice
in
reading
save
gabriel
adams
and
my
own
i
read
to
her
comforting
passages
of
scripture
and
said
prayers
which
carried
her
soul
up
to
the
throne
and
fell
back
on
mine
in
showers
of
dust
and
ashes
a
great
black
atheism
had
fallen
on
me
there
was
no
justice
on
earth
no
mercy
in

her
house
was
in
pittsburg
on
sixth
street
a
little
cottage
built
for
her
father
and
mother
when
they
were
alone
it
stood
back
in
a
yard
and
rough
men
in
passing
stepped
lightly
children
went
elsewhere
with
their
sports
friends
tapped
on
the
gate
and
we
went
out
to
answer
inquiries
and
receive
supplies
prayers
were
offered
for
her
in
churches
societies
and
families
the
house
was
a
shrine
consecrated
by
suffering
and
sorrow
the
third
month
passed
and
still
she
lingered
for
seven
weeks
she
took
no
nourishment
but
half
a
cup
of
milk
two
parts
water
per
day
then
her
appetite
returned
and
her
agony
increased
but
still
with
no
lament
save
my
father
is
it
not
enough
in
the
sixth
month
january
relief
came
as
i
knelt
for
her
last
words
she
said
elizabeth
i
replied
she
is
here
dear
mother
what
of
her
summoning
strength
she
said
let
no
one
separate
you
then
looked
up
and
said
it
is
enough
and
breathed
no
more
as
her
spirit
rose
it
broke
the
cloud
and
the
divine
presence
fell
upon
me
the
room
the
world
was
full
of
peace
she
had
been
caught
up
out
of
the
storm
and
he
who
endureth
unto
the
end
shall
be
saved
by
her
request
i
and
a
dear
friend
martha
campbell
prepared
her
body
for
burial
and
we
wrapped
her
in
a
linen
as
the
body
of
christ
was
buried
no
flowers
no
decorations
only
stern
solemn
death
on
the
last
day
of
father
life
he
had
said
to
her
mary
you
are
human
and
must
have
faults
but
whatever
they
are
i
never
have
seen
them
she
had
been
his
widow
seventeen
years
and
by
her
desire
we
opened
his
grave
and
laid
her
body
to
mingle
its
dust
with
his
who
had
been
her
only
love
in
the
life
that
now
is
and
with
whom
she
expected
to
spend
an
eternity

would
file
his
claim
against
her
executors
i
do
not
know
why
i
should
have
been
so
utterly
overwhelmed
by
this
proposal
to
execute
a
law
passed
by
christian
legislators
for
the
government
of
christian
people
a
law
which
had
never
been
questioned
by
any
nation
or
state
or
church
and
was
in
full
force
all
over
the
world
why
should
the
discovery
of
its
existence
curdle
my
blood
stop
my
and
send
a
rush
of
burning
shame
from
forehead
to
why
should
i
have
blushed
that
my
husband
was
a
citizen
of
the
freest
country
in
the
world
why
blame
him
for
acting
in
harmony
with
the
canons
of
every
christian
church
aye
of
that
one
of
which
i
was
a
member
and
proud
of
its
history
as
a
bulwark
of
civil
liberty
was
it
any
fault
of
his
that
all
that
she
the
wife
can
acquire
by
her
or
act
during
coverture
belongs
to
her
husband
certainly
not
yet
that
law
made
me
shrink
and
think
of
mother
warning
given
so
long
ago
but
marriage
was
a
and
god
required
me
to
keep
it
to
the
end
and
said
when
thou
passeth
through
the
fire
i
will
be
with
thee
and
the
floods
shall
not
overflow
thee
i
could
not
bear
to
have
a
bill
sent
to
mother
executors
for
my
wages
but
i
could
compromise
and
i
did
he
returned
to
louisville
sold
the
goods
went
on
a
and
joined
samuel
in
little
rock
while
he
was
there
samuel
died
died
a
presbyterian
and
left
this
message
for
me
tell
sister
jane
i
will
meet
her
in
heaven
this
my
husband
transmitted
to
me
and
was
deeply
grieved
and
much
softened
by
his
brother
death
rev
isaiah
niblock
of
butler
a
distant
relative
and
very
near
friend
asked
me
to
take
charge
of
the
butler
seminary
and
become
his
guest
my
salary
would
be
dollars
a
month
and
this
was
munificent
elizabeth
went
to
pittsburg
to
school
and
i
to
butler
where
my
success
was
complete
and
i
very
happy
among
my
pupils
were
two
daughters
of
my
old
patron
judge
braden
one
of
these
little
nannie
was
full
of
pleasant
surprises
and
brought
down
the
house
during
examination
by
reciting
a
country
girl
account
of
her
presentation
at
court
in
which
occurs
this
stanza
and
there
the
king
and
i
were
standing
face
and
face
together
i
said
is
your
majesty
it
mighty
pleasant
weather
by
nannie
way
of
giving
the
lines
they
were
so
fixed
on
my
memory
as
to
be
often
mingled
with
solemn
reveries
in
after
years
petitions
were
presented
in
the
pennsylvania
legislature
for
the
abolition
of
capital
punishment
senator
sullivan
chairman
of
the
committee
to
which
they
were
referred
wrote
to
niblock
for
the
scripture
view
he
was
ill
and
requested
me
to
answer
which
i
did
and
sullivan
drew
liberally
from
my
arguments
in
his
report
against
granting
the
petitions
the
report
was
attacked
and
i
defended
it
in
several
letters
published
in
a
butler
paper
anonymously
and
this
was
my
first
appearance
in
print
except
a
short
letter
published
by
george
prentiss
in
the
louisville
of
which
i
remember
nothing
save
the
strangeness
of
seeing
my
thoughts
in
print
chapter
xiv
age
in
april
my
husband
took
possession
of
the
old
home
in
the
valley
and
we
went
there
to
live
there
were
large
possibilities
in
the
old
house
and
we
soon
had
a
pleasant
residence
i
had
the
furniture
mother
left
me
and
a
small
income
from
her
estate
the
farm
i
named
swissvale
and
such
is
the
name
thereof
when
the
pennsylvania
railroad
was
built
it
ran
through
it
but
not
in
sight
of
the
house
and
the
station
was
called
for
the
homestead
in
the
summer
of
i
began
to
write
stories
and
rhymes
under
the
de
of
jennie
deans
for
dollar
and
saturday
both
of
philadelphia
reece
fleeson
published
an
weekly
in
pittsburg
spirit
of
and
for
this
i
wrote
abolition
articles
and
essays
on
woman
right
to
life
liberty
and
the
pursuit
of
happiness
my
productions
were
praised
and
my
husband
was
provoked
that
i
did
not
use
my
own
name
if
i
were
not
ashamed
of
my
articles
why
not
sign
them
he
had
not
given
up
the
idea
that
i
should
preach
indeed
he
held
me
accountable
for
most
of
the
evils
in
the
world
on
the
ground
that
i
could
overthrow
them
if
i
would
elizabeth
was
married
in
june
and
went
to
ohio
in
the
autumn
my
husband
mother
and
the
boys
came
to
live
with
us
to
which
i
made
no
objection
for
honor
thy
father
and
mother
was
spoken
as
much
to
him
as
to
me
maybe
i
had
some
spiritual
pride
in
seeing
that
she
turned
from
her
converted
daughters
who
were
wealthy
and
lived
near
to
make
a
home
with
unregenerate
me
she
liked
my
housekeeping
and
grandmother
as
i
always
called
her
with
her
white
and
caps
sitting
by
the
fireplace
plying
her
became
my
special
pride
my
husband
had
converted
the
louisville
goods
into
one
panther
one
deer
two
bears
and
a
roll
of
wildcat
money
it
was
not
very
good
stock
with
which
to
begin
life
on
a
farm
but
the
monotony
was
relieved
by
a
hooking
kicking
cow
and
a
horse
which
broke
wagons
to
splinters
tom
the
panther
was
domiciled
in
the
corner
made
by
the
old
stone
chimney
and
the
log
wall
of
the
house
close
to
the
path
which
led
to
the
garden
the
bears
were
chained
in
the
meadow
behind
the
house
and
billy
the
deer
ranged
at
will
tom
and
the
bears
ate
pigs
and
poultry
so
fast
that
we
gave
up
trying
to
raise
any
while
billy
visits
to
the
garden
did
not
improve
the
vegetables
i
tried
to
establish
some
control
over
tom
as
a
substitute
for
the
fear
he
felt
for
his
master
who
was
not
always
within
call
and
who
insisted
that
tom
could
be
tamed
so
as
to
serve
the
place
of
a
watchdog
tom
had
been
quite
obedient
for
tom
and
my
terror
for
him
had
abated
i
was
interested
in
the
heathen
of
india
and
was
president
of
a
society
which
met
in
pittsburg
coming
home
from
a
meeting
i
was
thrown
out
of
a
buggy
and
so
badly
hurt
that
i
was
kept
in
bed
six
weeks
when
i
began
to
go
out
on
crutches
i
started
to
go
to
the
garden
and
forgot
tom
until
i
heard
him
growl
he
lay
flat
with
his
nose
on
his
paws
his
tail
on
the
ground
straight
as
a
ramrod
save
a
few
inches
at
the
tip
which
wagged
slowly
his
eyes
green
and
fiery
and
i
not
three
feet
from
his
head
and
just
in
reach
even
if
his
chain
held
but
i
had
seen
it
break
in
one
of
those
springs
which
he
was
now
preparing
to
make
there
was
no
help
near
he
would
spring
for
my
head
and
shoulders
if
these
were
out
of
his
way
he
could
not
hold
me
by
my
dress
which
was
a
thin
muslin
wrapper
he
was
not
likely
to
leap
until
something
moved
and
might
lie
there
sometime
i
had
heard
that
a
panther
will
not
jump
under
the
gaze
of
a
human
eye
so
i
looked
steadily
into
his
while
i
talked
to
him
tom
tom
down
sir
and
so
tried
to
recall
his
knowledge
of
me
fortunately
my
feet
were
a
little
in
advance
of
my
crutches
and
while
i
looked
and
talked
holding
my
body
motionless
i
was
planting
my
crutches
and
throwing
my
weight
on
my
well
foot
i
heard
the
girl
coming
out
of
the
house
and
knew
the
time
had
come
with
all
my
strength
i
swung
myself
backward
as
he
made
the
leap
his
hot
breath
rushed
into
my
face
his
fiery
eyes
glared
close
to
mine
but
his
chain
was
too
short
then
i
knew
i
had
no
mission
for
taming
panthers
from
the
first
i
had
feared
that
he
would
kill
some
child
and
it
was
impossible
to
prevent
them
trooping
to
see
him
after
my
own
narrow
escape
i
protested
so
strongly
against
keeping
him
that
my
husband
consented
to
sell
him
to
a
menagerie
but
those
which
came
were
supplied
with
panthers
and
although
he
was
a
splendid
specimen
full
nine
feet
long
no
sale
was
found
for
him
that
adventure
supplied
memory
with
a
picture
which
for
long
years
breathed
and
never
was
absent
if
it
was
not
before
me
it
was
in
some
corner
and
i
knew
tom
was
crouched
to
spring
on
me
his
fiery
eyes
glared
the
tip
of
his
tail
wagged
and
he
was
waiting
only
waiting
for
me
to
move
often
when
i
woke
at
night
he
was
on
my
bed
or
in
a
corner
of
the
room
he
was
hidden
in
fence
corners
and
behind
bushes
on
the
roadside
and
mary
little
lamb
was
never
half
so
faithful
as
my
phantom
panther
my
husband
could
not
understand
the
fear
i
felt
nor
realize
the
danger
of
keeping
him
he
enjoyed
his
own
mastery
over
him
and
with
a
box
on
the
side
of
the
head
he
made
tom
whine
and
crouch
like
a
spaniel
i
have
often
wondered
that
in
all
the
accounts
i
have
ever
read
of
lights
with
wild
animals
no
one
ever
planted
a
good
under
the
ear
of
his
antagonist
and
so
stretch
it
out
stiff
to
await
his
leisure
in
disposing
of
it
chapter
xv
willows
by
the
age
pennsylvania
customs
made
it
unmanly
for
a
man
or
boy
to
aid
any
woman
even
mother
or
wife
in
any
hard
work
with
which
farms
abounded
at
that
time
dairy
work
candle
and
sausage
making
were
done
by
women
and
any
innovation
was
met
with
sneers
i
stubbornly
refused
to
yield
altogether
to
a
code
which
required
women
to
perform
outdoor
drudgery
often
while
men
sat
in
the
house
and
soon
had
the
sympathy
of
our
own
boys
for
it
was
often
impossible
to
obtain
any
domestic
help
though
pittsburg
charitable
people
supported
hundreds
of
women
in
idleness
who
might
have
had
homes
and
wages
in
farmhouses
much
of
the
natural
beauty
of
swissvale
had
been
destroyed
by
pioneer
improvements
which
i
sought
in
some
degree
to
replace
i
loved
the
woods
and
with
my
little
transplanted
many
wild
and
beautiful
things
this
my
did
not
approve
as
her
love
for
the
beautiful
was
satisfied
by
a
flower
border
in
the
garden
one
day
she
said
james
i
would
not
have
that
willow
in
that
corner
the
roots
will
get
into
the
race
it
is
the
real
basket
willow
and
if
you
cut
it
into
stubs
and
stick
them
in
the
swamp
you
can
sell
enough
willow
to
buy
all
your
baskets
i
replied
grandmother
you
forget
that
is
my
tree
i
want
it
to
drape
that
bare
knoll
the
roots
will
run
below
the
bed
of
the
race
the
boys
can
get
plenty
of
stubs
at
flemming
she
only
replied
by
a
humph
and
next
day
i
discovered
my
tree
had
been
sawed
into
pieces
and
planted
in
the
swamp
words
would
not
restore
it
and
i
wasted
none
but
next
morning
rose
early
and
hatchet
in
hand
went
to
the
parent
tree
climbed
on
a
fence
and
cut
off
a
limb
which
i
dragged
home
feeling
glad
that
anything
had
brought
me
a
walk
on
such
a
glorious
morning
i
planted
the
main
stock
in
that
corner
then
put
about
a
hundred
twigs
in
the
swamp
for
basket
willow
in
a
few
days
my
second
tree
disappeared
and
i
brought
another
for
a
tree
there
was
indispensable
and
i
hoped
to
make
my
husband
see
as
i
did
and
thought
i
had
won
his
consent
to
willows
so
i
went
up
and
down
the
race
and
runs
putting
in
twigs
and
thinking
of
the
willows
by
the
watercourses
and
israel
lament
by
babel
streams
we
sat
and
wept
when
zion
we
thought
on
in
midst
thereof
we
hanged
our
harps
the
willow
trees
upon
i
was
banished
from
my
zion
never
permitted
to
hear
the
teachings
of
my
old
pastor
for
which
my
soul
panted
as
the
thirsty
hart
for
the
water
brooks
and
in
my
babylon
i
wanted
willows
some
of
my
plantings
were
permitted
to
remain
and
swissvale
is
now
noted
for
its
magnificent
willows
but
that
main
tree
was
chopped
up
and
burned
in
its
stead
i
planted
a
young
chestnut
where
it
still
stands
a
thing
of
beauty
and
joy
to
the
boys
chapter
xvi
the
waters
grow
age
the
plans
for
my
conversion
seemed
to
be
aided
by
our
coming
to
the
farm
as
i
fitted
up
the
prophet
chamber
to
entertain
my
friends
in
his
house
there
were
two
preachers
in
the
circuit
the
eldest
a
plain
blunt
man
began
on
his
first
visit
to
pelt
me
with
problems
about
ministers
and
calvinism
i
replied
by
citing
the
election
of
abraham
jacob
and
the
entire
jewish
nation
and
by
quoting
the
chapter
of
romans
until
he
seemed
to
despair
and
came
no
more
for
they
could
not
accept
my
hospitality
while
i
refused
their
religion
the
other
circuit
rider
was
young
handsome
and
zealous
and
was
doing
a
great
work
in
converting
young
girls
on
his
first
visit
i
thought
him
rude
on
his
second
he
inquired
at
table
is
this
the
place
where
they
put
onions
into
everything
i
replied
that
we
used
none
in
tea
or
coffee
when
i
joined
him
and
my
husband
in
the
parlor
he
waved
his
hand
around
the
room
to
point
out
its
decorations
and
said
brother
james
tells
me
that
this
is
all
your
work
it
is
quite
wonderful
and
now
sister
what
a
pity
it
is
that
you
will
not
turn
your
attention
to
religion
you
seem
to
do
everything
so
well
he
motioned
as
if
to
lay
his
hand
on
my
shoulder
i
drew
back
and
said
excuse
me
sir
but
i
am
not
your
sister
and
as
for
your
religion
you
remind
me
with
it
of
doctor
jaynes
and
his
hair
tonic
how
so
sister
again
pardon
but
i
am
not
your
sister
doctor
jaynes
uses
a
large
part
of
his
column
to
persuade
us
that
it
is
good
to
have
good
hair
no
one
disputes
that
and
he
should
prove
that
his
tonic
will
bring
good
hair
so
you
talk
of
the
importance
of
religion
no
one
disputes
this
and
it
is
your
business
to
prove
that
the
nostrum
you
peddle
is
religion
i
say
it
is
not
it
is
a
system
of
will
worship
religion
is
obedience
to
god
law
you
teach
people
that
they
can
and
do
obey
this
law
perfectly
while
they
do
not
know
it
your
church
has
no
bibles
in
her
pews
few
in
her
families
and
these
unread
preachers
and
all
not
one
in
twenty
can
repeat
the
ten
commandments
you
are
blind
leaders
of
the
blind
and
must
all
fall
into
the
ditch
destroyed
for
lack
of
knowledge
that
week
he
proposed
to
abandon
the
swissvale
and
build
one
in
wilkinsburg
giving
as
a
reason
the
impossibility
of
keeping
up
a
congregation
with
me
on
the
farm
next
conference
sent
rev
henderson
as
presiding
elder
who
brought
in
a
new
era
he
slept
in
the
prophet
chamber
admired
my
pretty
rooms
and
said
nothing
about
my
getting
religion
the
circuit
preacher
was
of
the
same
mind
an
earnest
modest
young
man
wrestling
with
english
grammar
who
on
his
first
visit
sought
my
help
about
adverbs
while
my
looked
on
in
evident
displeasure
to
her
this
was
the
dawn
of
that
new
day
in
which
the
methodist
church
rivals
all
others
in
her
institutions
of
learning
the
good
time
of
inspiration
was
slipping
away
what
wonder
that
she
clutched
it
as
jacob
did
his
angel
there
in
that
house
she
had
for
long
years
been
an
oracle
to
inspired
men
and
now
to
see
god
spirit
displaced
by
grammar
was
rank
infidelity
the
wilkinsburg
was
being
built
and
that
one
which
had
been
to
her
all
that
the
temple
ever
was
to
solomon
would
be
left
to
the
owls
and
bats
her
zion
desolate
those
walls
made
sacred
by
visions
of
glory
and
shouts
of
triumph
would
crumble
to
ruin
in
the
clinging
silence
how
could
she
but
think
that
the
influence
was
evil
which
could
bring
such
result
the
new
building
was
consecrated
with
much
ceremony
the
two
hendersons
staid
with
us
and
on
sabbath
morning
consulted
me
as
to
the
best
way
of
taking
up
subscriptions
looked
on
till
she
could
bear
it
no
longer
and
said
brother
henderson
if
you
mean
to
be
in
time
for
love
feast
you
must
not
stay
fooling
there
both
men
sprang
to
their
feet
hurried
away
and
never
returned
general
conference
at
its
session
in
baltimore
in
passed
the
black
gag
law
which
forbade
colored
members
of
the
church
to
give
testimony
in
against
white
members
in
any
state
where
they
were
forbidden
to
testily
in
courts
four
members
of
the
pittsburg
conference
voted
for
it
and
when
my
husband
returned
from
the
dedication
i
learned
that
three
of
them
had
figured
prominently
in
the
exercises
and
he
had
refused
to
commune
on
account
of
their
ministrations
everything
went
smoothly
for
ten
days
when
my
husband
came
to
our
room
where
i
sat
writing
threw
himself
on
the
bed
and
poured
out
such
a
torrent
of
accusations
as
i
had
not
dreamed
possible
and
of
which
i
refrain
from
giving
any
adequate
description
i
looked
up
and
saw
that
he
was
livid
with
rage
his
words
appeared
the
ravings
of
a
mad
man
yet
there
was
method
in
them
and
no
crime
in
the
calendar
with
which
they
did
not
charge
me
butter
money
was
not
accounted
for
pickles
and
preserves
missing
things
about
the
house
were
going
to
destruction
the
country
was
full
of
falsehoods
and
i
had
told
them
all
it
was
all
a
blur
of
sound
and
fury
but
in
it
stood
out
these
words
you
ruined
samuel
and
now
you
are
trying
to
ruin
the
boys
and
those
two
fool
preachers
people
know
it
too
and
i
am
ashamed
to
show
my
face
for
the
talk
when
he
seemed
to
have
finished
i
asked
how
long
since
you
learned
my
real
character
this
spurred
him
to
new
wrath
and
he
exclaimed
there
now
that
the
next
of
it
you
will
go
and
tell
that
i
abused
you
it
not
me
i
never
suspected
your
honesty
but
my
mother
yes
my
poor
old
mother
i
would
not
care
if
you
could
only
behave
yourself
before
my
mother
i
sat
leaning
my
elbows
on
my
table
with
my
head
in
my
hands
and
the
words
ruined
samuel
became
a
refrain
i
thought
of
the
danger
out
of
which
i
had
plucked
him
while
in
louisville
of
the
force
with
which
i
had
grappled
him
with
hooks
of
steel
as
he
hung
on
the
outer
edge
of
that
precipice
of
dissipation
while
i
clung
to
the
almighty
arm
for
help
i
thought
of
the
tears
and
solemnity
with
which
this
man
had
given
to
me
the
dying
message
of
that
rescued
brother
earth
seemed
to
be
passing
away
and
to
leave
no
standing
room
i
was
teaching
school
in
the
abandoned
it
was
noon
recess
and
i
must
hurry
or
be
late
i
passed
into
the
hall
and
out
of
the
house
with
the
thought
i
cross
his
threshold
now
for
the
last
time
but
i
must
remain
near
and
finish
my
school
when
i
would
be
present
to
meet
those
monstrous
charges
before
the
world
my
reveries
did
not
interfere
with
my
school
duties
and
when
they
were
over
i
sat
in
the
old
or
walked
its
one
aisle
with
the
quiet
dead
lying
all
around
me
thinking
of
that
good
fight
which
i
should
fight
ere
i
finished
my
course
and
lay
down
to
rest
as
they
did
but
the
sun
went
down
the
long
twilight
drew
on
the
coming
night
and
i
was
homeless
where
should
i
go
i
thought
of
the
burkhammers
whose
little
son
lay
among
the
dead
beside
me
i
had
tended
him
in
his
last
illness
and
prepared
his
body
for
burial
they
were
german
tenants
of
judge
wilkins
and
to
reach
their
house
i
must
pass
through
the
dark
valley
over
which
now
lay
a
new
pall
there
were
lights
in
the
house
as
i
passed
and
tom
rattled
his
chain
and
gave
forth
one
of
those
shrieks
which
pierced
the
air
for
a
mile
i
was
glad
to
know
that
he
was
not
loose
and
that
it
was
only
my
phantom
which
crouched
in
every
available
place
ready
to
spring
the
bears
bellowed
a
response
to
his
shriek
but
i
did
not
hasten
the
stream
so
loud
and
angry
on
that
night
of
my
first
entrance
into
this
vale
of
tears
was
now
low
and
sang
a
lullaby
of
angelic
music
as
i
crossed
it
on
stepping
stones
on
the
hillside
it
was
almost
as
dark
as
that
night
when
father
olever
stopped
and
felt
for
the
bank
with
his
whip
the
burkhammers
asked
no
questions
and
i
went
to
sleep
without
giving
any
account
of
my
strange
visit
but
about
midnight
i
awoke
myself
and
the
whole
family
by
my
sobs
they
gathered
around
my
bed
and
i
must
tell
what
i
said
i
do
not
know
but
the
old
man
interrupted
me
with
oh
tamm
jim
you
stay
here
mit
us
my
old
woman
und
me
we
has
blenty
we
dakes
care
of
you
nopody
never
said
nodding
bad
about
you
everypody
likes
you
caus
you
is
bleasant
mit
everypody
as
he
talked
he
drew
his
sleeve
across
his
eyes
while
his
wife
and
daughter
comforted
me
i
would
board
there
and
finish
my
school
then
go
to
butler
and
take
the
seminary
or
a
place
in
the
common
school
i
saw
no
one
as
i
passed
my
late
home
next
morning
in
school
the
first
exercise
was
bible
reading
verse
about
with
the
pupils
the
xxv
chapter
of
matthew
came
in
order
and
while
reading
its
account
of
the
final
judgment
i
saw
as
by
a
revelation
why
this
trouble
had
been
sent
to
me
and
a
great
flood
of
light
seemed
thrown
across
my
path
before
me
christ
little
ones
were
sick
and
in
prison
and
i
had
not
visited
them
old
martha
standing
before
her
judges
rose
up
to
upbraid
me
i
was
to
have
followed
the
lamb
and
had
been
making
butter
to
add
to
an
estate
larger
now
than
the
owner
could
use
no
wonder
she
thought
i
stole
the
money
i
who
had
failed
to
rebuke
might
steal
anything
that
which
i
had
been
helping
to
build
by
entertaining
its
builders
and
aiding
them
about
subscriptions
it
and
they
were
a
part
of
a
great
machine
i
had
been
false
to
every
principle
of
justice
had
been
decorating
parlors
when
i
should
have
been
tearing
down
prisons
helping
black
gagites
build
a
church
when
thou
a
thief
didst
see
thou
with
him
in
sin
thinking
reaching
out
for
the
path
to
that
bastile
which
i
must
attack
i
went
on
with
my
school
duties
until
my
husband
walked
in
and
asked
why
i
had
not
been
at
home
i
was
worn
with
intense
strain
and
at
the
word
home
burst
into
a
passion
of
tears
i
told
the
pupils
to
take
their
books
and
leave
there
would
be
no
more
school
and
i
could
hear
them
go
around
on
and
whisper
twice
a
pair
of
little
arms
were
thrown
around
me
and
the
sound
of
the
retreating
footsteps
died
away
when
my
husband
laid
his
hand
all
trembling
on
my
head
i
threw
it
off
and
begged
him
to
go
away
his
presence
would
kill
me
he
would
not
go
and
i
went
out
into
the
woods
he
followed
and
said
he
had
never
charged
me
with
an
evil
thought
much
less
an
action
was
the
most
loving
of
husbands
and
the
most
injured
in
that
i
had
thought
he
had
found
fault
with
me
he
might
have
spoken
a
hasty
word
but
was
it
right
to
lay
it
up
against
him
i
still
begged
him
to
leave
that
i
should
die
if
he
did
not
he
went
and
i
crossed
the
fields
to
the
house
of
thomas
dickson
thinking
that
from
it
i
could
get
to
the
city
by
the
river
road
and
fly
any
where
dickson
made
me
go
to
bed
as
i
was
able
to
go
no
where
else
and
here
my
husband
found
me
he
had
come
as
and
could
not
think
what
it
all
meant
some
angry
words
of
james
about
his
mother
who
would
now
go
back
to
live
with
him
the
dicksons
joined
him
with
entreaties
if
my
husband
had
injured
me
he
was
very
very
sorry
was
quite
overwhelmed
with
grief
for
the
pain
he
had
cost
me
then
they
brought
down
the
lever
of
scripture
and
conscience
if
thy
brother
offend
thee
seventy
times
seven
and
i
yielded
my
husband
came
and
i
went
home
with
him
that
evening
expecting
that
my
was
installed
in
her
new
home
on
the
hill
but
she
met
and
kissed
me
at
the
door
and
i
did
not
care
nothing
could
add
to
the
shudder
of
going
into
the
house
and
she
seemed
so
grieved
and
frightened
that
my
heart
was
touched
and
i
was
sorry
for
her
that
we
had
ever
met
chapter
xvii
my
name
appears
in
age
it
was
the
third
morning
after
my
return
that
my
head
would
not
leave
the
pillow
carothers
came
and
blistered
me
from
head
to
feet
and
for
three
weeks
i
saw
no
one
but
my
attendants
and
my
phantom
panther
he
never
left
me
there
was
one
corner
of
the
room
in
which
he
stayed
most
and
sometimes
there
was
not
room
for
his
tail
to
wag
and
then
he
moved
forward
where
i
could
not
see
his
head
this
troubled
me
for
then
i
could
not
hold
him
with
my
eyes
at
night
they
were
two
balls
of
green
fire
but
they
had
always
been
only
when
i
was
well
i
could
turn
my
head
away
now
i
could
not
move
it
i
knew
most
of
the
time
it
was
a
shadow
from
my
brain
but
was
glad
to
hear
tom
chain
rattle
and
feel
sure
it
was
not
his
very
self
they
nursed
me
carefully
and
i
lay
thinking
of
the
little
ones
sick
and
in
prison
old
martha
came
and
plead
with
me
i
saw
liza
and
maria
under
the
lash
for
the
crime
of
chastity
and
myself
the
accomplice
of
their
brutal
masters
i
pictured
one
of
them
a
member
of
the
church
appealing
to
that
church
for
redress
and
spurned
under
the
black
gag
and
i
why
i
had
been
helping
men
who
voted
for
it
to
build
a
what
was
peter
denial
compared
to
mine
the
case
arranged
itself
in
my
mind
i
had
writing
materials
brought
and
there
with
my
head
fast
on
the
pillow
i
wrote
a
hexameter
rhyme
half
a
column
long
arraigning
by
name
those
black
gag
preachers
painting
the
scene
and
holding
them
responsible
i
signed
my
initials
and
sent
it
to
fleeson
with
a
note
telling
him
to
give
my
name
if
it
was
inquired
for
our
spirit
did
not
come
that
week
but
soon
my
husband
came
to
my
room
with
a
copy
of
the
pittsburg
gazette
in
which
was
an
editorial
and
letter
full
of
pious
horror
and
denunciation
of
that
article
and
giving
my
name
as
the
author
so
that
we
knew
fleeson
had
published
the
name
in
full
this
was
my
first
appearance
in
print
over
my
own
signature
and
while
i
was
shocked
my
husband
was
delighted
even
though
he
knew
a
libel
suit
was
threatened
i
soon
went
to
pittsburg
saw
william
elder
and
john
wills
the
only
lawyers
in
the
city
they
said
the
article
was
actionable
for
it
had
brought
those
men
into
contempt
elder
added
they
are
badly
hurt
or
they
would
not
cry
out
so
loud
both
tendered
their
gratuitous
services
for
my
defense
in
a
civil
suit
we
could
prove
the
truth
of
the
charge
and
they
could
get
nothing
for
my
husband
owned
no
property
everything
belonged
to
his
mother
and
my
trustees
could
not
be
held
for
my
misdeeds
their
action
would
doubtless
be
criminal
and
i
would
probably
be
imprisoned
i
went
home
and
wrote
a
reply
to
the
which
it
refused
to
publish
but
it
appeared
in
the
i
reiterated
urged
and
intensified
my
charges
against
these
false
priests
until
they
were
dumb
about
their
injuries
and
libel
suit
but
of
that
original
article
i
never
could
get
a
copy
every
one
had
been
sold
and
resold
and
read
to
rags
before
i
knew
it
was
in
print
i
continued
to
write
for
the
spirit
but
still
there
did
not
seem
to
be
anything
i
could
do
for
the
slave
as
soon
as
i
was
able
to
be
about
the
house
i
fell
into
my
old
round
of
drudgery
but
with
hope
and
pride
shut
out
of
it
once
my
burden
pressed
so
that
i
could
not
sleep
and
rose
at
early
dawn
and
sat
looking
over
the
meadow
seeing
nothing
but
a
dense
white
fog
i
leaned
back
closed
my
eyes
and
thought
how
like
it
was
to
my
own
life
when
i
looked
again
oh
the
vision
of
glory
which
met
my
sight
the
rising
sun
had
sent
through
an
opening
in
the
woods
a
shaft
of
light
which
centred
on
a
hickory
tree
that
stood
alone
in
the
meadow
and
was
then
in
the
perfection
of
its
golden
autumn
glory
it
dripped
with
moisture
blazed
and
shimmered
the
high
lights
were
diamond
tipped
and
between
them
and
the
deepest
shadow
was
every
tint
of
orange
and
yellow
mingled
and
blended
in
those
inimitable
lines
of
natural
foliage
over
it
through
it
and
around
it
rolled
the
white
fog
in
great
masses
caressing
the
earth
and
hanging
from
the
zenith
like
the
veil
of
the
temple
of
the
most
high
all
around
lay
the
dark
woods
framing
in
the
vision
like
serried
ranks
encompassing
a
throne
to
which
great
clouds
rolled
then
lifted
and
scudded
away
like
couriers
coming
for
orders
and
hastening
to
obey
them

my

james
birney
was
the
presidential
candidate
of

party
in

he
had
been
in
during
the
campaign
i
wrote
under
my
initials
for
spirit
of
and
exposing
the
weak
part
of
an
argument
soon
came
to
be
my
recognized
forte
for
using
my
initials
i
had
two
reasons
my
dislike
and
dread
of
publicity
and
the
fear
of
embarrassing
the
liberty
party
with
the
sex
question
abolitionists
were
men
of
sharp
angles
organizing
them
was
like
binding
crooked
sticks
in
a
bundle
and
one
of
the
questions
which
divided
them
was
the
right
of
women
to
take
any
prominent
part
in
public
affairs
in
that
campaign
the
great
whig
argument
against
the
election
of
polk
was
that
it
would
bring
on
a
war

for
the

came

country
right
or
wrong
and
rushed
into
the
army
over
every
barrier
set
up
by
their
late
arguments
the
nation
was
seized
by
a
military
madness
and
in
the
furore
the
cause
of
the
slave
went
to
the
wall
and
spirit
of
was
discontinued
its
predecessor
christian
had
failed
under
the
successive
management
of
william
burleigh
elder
and
rev
edward
smith
three
giants
in
those
days
and
there
seemed
no
hope
that
any
paper
could
be
supported
in
pittsburg
while
all
matter
was
carefully
excluded
from
both
religious
and
secular
press
it
was
a
dark
day
for
the
slave
and
it
was
difficult
to
see
hope
for
a
brighter
to
me
it
seemed
that
all
was
lost
unless
some
one
were
especially
called
to
speak
that
truth
which
alone
could
make
the
people
free
but
certainly
i
could
not
be
the
messenger
for
years
there
had
ran
through
my
head
the
words
open
thy
mouth
for
the
dumb
plead
the
cause
of
the
poor
and
needy
the
streams
sang
them
the
winds
shrieked
them
and
now
a
trumpet
sounded
them
but
the
words
could
not
mean
more
than
talking
in
private
i
would
not
could
not
believe
they
meant
more
for
the
bible
in
which
i
read
them
bid
me
be
silent
my
husband
wanted
me
to
lecture
as
did
abbey
kelley
but
i
thought
this
would
surely
be
wrong
the
church
had
silenced
me
so
effectuately
that
even
now
all
my
sense
of
the
great
need
of
words
could
not
induce
me
to
attempt
it
but
if
i
could
plead
the
cause
through
the
press
i
must
write
even
this
was
dreadful
as
i
must
use
my
own
name
for
my
articles
would
certainly
be
libelous
if
i
wrote
at
all
i
must
throw
myself
headlong
into
the
great
political
maelstrom
and
would
of
course
be
swallowed
up
like
a
in
the
great
norway
horror
which
decorated
our
school
geographies
for
no
woman
had
ever
done
such
a
thing
and
i
could
never
again
hold
up
my
head
under
the
burden
of
shame
and
disgrace
which
would
be
heaped
upon
me
but
what
matter
i
had
no
children
to
dishonor
all
save
one
who
had
ever
loved
me
were
dead
and
she
no
longer
needed
me
and
if
the
lord
wanted
some
one
to
throw
into
that
gulf
no
one
could
be
better
spared
than
i
pittsburg
commercial
was
the
leading
whig
paper
of
western
pennsylvania
robert
riddle
its
editor
and
proprietor
his
mother
was
a
member
of
our
church
and
i
thought
somewhere
in
his
veins
must
stir
blood
so
i
wrote
a
letter
to
the
which
appeared
with
an
editorial
disclaimer
but
the
fair
writer
should
have
a
hearing
this
letter
was
followed
by
another
and
they
continued
to
appear
once
or
twice
a
week
during
several
months
i
do
not
remember
whom
i
attacked
first
but
from
first
to
last
my
articles
were
as
direct
and
personal
as
nathan
reproof
to
david
of
slavery
in
the
abstract
i
knew
nothing
there
was
no
abstraction
in
tying
martha
to
a
and
scourging
her
for
mourning
the
loss
of
her
children
the
old
kentucky
saint
who
bore
the
torture
of
lash
and
brine
all
that
bright
sabbath
day
rather
than
curse
jesus
knew
nothing
of
the
abstraction
of
slavery
or
the
finespun
theories
of
politeness
which
covered
the
most
revolting
crimes
with
pretty
words
this
great
nation
was
engaged
in
the
pusillanimous
work
of
beating
poor
little
mexico
a
giant
whipping
a
cripple
every
man
who
went
to
the
war
or
induced
others
to
go
i
held
as
the
principal
in
the
whole
list
of
crimes
of
which
slavery
was
the
synonym
each
one
seemed
to
stand
before
me
his
innermost
soul
laid
bare
and
his
idiosyncrasy
i
was
sure
to
strike
with
sarcasm
ridicule
solemn
denunciations
old
truths
from
bible
and
history
and
the
opinions
of
good
men
i
had
a
reckless
abandon
for
had
i
not
thrown
myself
into
the
breach
to
die
there
and
would
i
not
sell
my
life
at
its
full
value
my
style
i
caught
from
my
crude
rural
surroundings
and
was
familiar
to
the
unlearned
and
i
was
not
surprised
to
find
the
letters
eagerly
read
the
announced
them
the
day
before
publication
the
newsboys
cried
them
and
papers
called
attention
to
them
some
by
daring
to
indorse
but
more
by
abusing
riddle
for
publishing
such
unpatriotic
and
incendiary
rant
in
quoting
the
strong
points
a
venal
press
was
constrained
to
scatter
the
living
coals
of
truth
the
name
was
held
to
be
a
de
for
in
print
it
looked
so
unlike
the
common
pronunciation
of
that
of
one
of
the
oldest
families
in
the
county
that
it
was
not
recognized
moreover
it
must
be
a
disguise
adopted
by
some
man
wiseacres
said
one
of
the
county
judges
no
western
pennsylvania
woman
had
ever
broken
out
of

sphere
all
lived
in
the
very
centre
of
that
sacred
enclosure
making
fires
by
which
husbands
brothers
and
sons
sat
reading
the
news
each
one
knowing
that
she
had
a
soul
because
the
preacher
who
made
his
bread
and
butter
by
saving
it
had
been
careful
to
inform
her
of
its
existence
as
preliminary
to
her
knowledge
of
the
indispensable
nature
of
his
services
but
the
men
whom
i
ridiculed
and
attacked
knew
the
hand
which
held
the
mirror
up
to
nature
and
also
knew
they
had
a
legal
remedy
and
that
to
their
fines
and
imprisonment
i
was
as
indifferent
as
to
their
opinions
one
of
these

gabriel
adams
had
taken
me
by
the
hand
at
funeral
led
me
to
a
stranger
and
introduced
me
as
the
child
i
told
you
of
but
eight
years
old
her
father
nurse
and
comforter
he
had
smoothed
my
hair
and
told
me
not
to
cry
god
would
bless
me
for
being
a
good
child
he
was
a
member
of
the
session
when
i
joined
church
his
voice
in
prayer
had
soothed
mother
hard
journey
through
the
dark
valley
and
now
as
mayor
of
the
city
had
ordered
its
illumination
in
honor
of
the
battle
of
buena
vista
and
this
too
on
saturday
evening
when
the
unholy
glorification
extended
into
the
sabbath
measured
by
the
standards
of
his
profession
as
an
elder
in
the
church
whose
highest
judicatory
had
pronounced
slavery
and
christianity
incompatible
no
one
was
more
valuable
than
he
and
of
none
was
i
so
unsparing
yet
as
i
wrote
the
letter
was
blistered
with
tears
but
his
oft
repeated
comment
was
jane
is
right
and
he
went
out
of
his
way
to
take
my
hand
and
say
you
were
right
samuel
black
a
son
of
my
pastor
dropped
his
place
as
leader
of
the
pittsburg
bar
and
rushed
to
the
war
my
comments
were
thought
severe
even
for
me
yet
the
first
intimation
i
had
that
i
had
not
been
cast
aside
as
a
monster
came
from
his
sister
who
sent
me
a
message
that
her
father
her
husband
and
herself
approved
my
criticism
samuel
returned
with
a
colonel
commission
and
one
day
i
was
about
to
pass
him
without
recognition
where
he
stood
on
the
pavement
talking
to
two
other
lawyers
when
he
stepped
before
me
and
held
out
his
hand
i
drew
back
and
he
said
is
it
possible
you
will
not
take
my
hand
i
looked
at
it
then
into
his
manly
handsome
face
and
answered
there
is
blood
on
it
the
blood
of
women
and
children
slain
at
their
own
altars
on
their
own
hearthstones
that
you
might
spread
the
glorious
american
institution
of
and
oh
he
exclaimed
this
is
too
bad
i
swear
to
you
i
never
killed
a
woman
or
a
child
then
you
did
not
fight
in
mexico
did
not
help
to
bombard
buena
vista
his
friends
joined
him
and
insisted
that
i
did
the
colonel
great
wrong
when
he
looked
squarely
into
my
face
and
holding
out
his
hand
said
for
sake
of
the
old
church
for
sake
of
the
old
man
for
sake
of
the
old
times
give
me
your
hand
i
laid
it
in
his
and
hurried
away
unable
to
speak
for
he
was
the
most
eloquent
man
in
pennsylvania
he
fell
at
last
at
the
head
of
his
regiment
while
fighting
in
the
battle
of
fair
oaks
for
that
freedom
he
had
betrayed
in
mexico
when
kossuth
was
on
his
starring
tour
in
this
country
he
used
to
create
wild
enthusiasm
by
your
own
late
glorious
struggle
with
mexico
but
when
he
reached
that
climax
in
his
pittsburg
speech
a
dead
silence
fell
upon
the
vast
cheering
audience
the
social
ostracism
i
had
expected
when
i
stepped
into
the
political
arena
proved
to
be
bunyan
lions
instead
of
shame
there
came
such
a
crop
of
glory
that
i
thought
of
pulling
down
my
barns
and
building
greater
that
i
might
have
where
to
store
my
new
goods
among
the

this
troubled
me
because
it
seemed

i
had
been
working
for
praise
still
the
pretty

gratified

chapter
xix
training
school
paul
fought
with
beasts
at
ephesus
as
a
part
of
his
training
for
that
good
fight
with
principalities
and
powers
and
iniquity
in
high
places
and
i
think
that
tom
and
the
bears
helped
to
prepare
me
for
a
long
conflict
with
the
southern
tiger
i
had
early
come
to
think
that
tom
would
kill
some
of
the
children
who
trooped
to
see
him
and
that
i
should
be
responsible
as
i
alone
saw
the
danger
this
danger
i
sought
to
avert
but
how
to
dispose
of
the
beautiful
creature
i
could
not
conjecture
there
was
usually
a
loaded
gun
in
the
house
but
i
was
almost
as
much
afraid
of
it
as
of
tom
all
our
neighbors
were
delighted
with
him
and
loath
to
have
him
killed
i
had
once
tried
to
poison
a
cat
but
failed
and
i
would
not
torture
tom
i
wanted
palmer
to
give
me
a
dose
for
him
but
he
declined
i
tried
in
vain
to
get
some
one
to
shoot
him
then
i
thought
of
striking
the
great
beast
on
the
head
with
a
hatchet
while
he
had
hold
of
some
domestic
animal
the
plan
seemed
feasible
but
i
kept
my
own
council
and
my
hatchet
and
practiced
with
it
until
i
could
hit
a
mark
and
thought
i
could
bury
the
sharp
blade
in
tom
skull
one
day
all
the
men
were
in
the
meadow
making
hay
and
i
alone
getting
dinner
john
mckelvey
came
with
his
great
dog
watch
he
went
up
into
the
meadow
and
watch
staid
in
the
kitchen
i
started
to
go
to
the
garden
for
parsley
and
found
tom
crouched
to
spring
on
a
cow
he
made
the
leap
came
short
of
the
cow
which
ran
away
bellowing
with
terror
and
tom
had
but
touched
the
ground
when
watch
sprang
upon
him
it
was
a
sight
for
an
amphitheatre
the
two
great
creatures
rolled
in
a
struggle
which
i
knew
must
be
fatal
to
watch
but
thought
he
could
engage
attention
until
i
got
my
hatchet
i
ran
back
for
it
took
the
and
blew
a
blast
that
would
bring
one
man
and
i
did
not
want
a
thousand
then
i
ran
back
to
the
scene
of
conflict
horn
in
one
hand
hatchet
in
the
other
and
lo
no
conflict
was
there
no
tom
no
dog
nothing
but
the
torn
and
bloody
ground
horror
of
horrors
there
was
a
broken
chain
tom
loose
tom
free
now
some
one
would
be
murdered
i
turned
to
look
and
there
on
a
log
not
a
rod
from
me
he
stood
with
head
erect
and
tail
drooping
his
white
throat
jaws
and
broken
chain
dripping
with
blood
and
with
my
first
thankfulness
that
he
had
not
escaped
came
admiration
for
the
splendid
sight
the
bold
sweeping
curves
and
graceful
motion
as
he
turned
his
head
to
listen
then
i
learned
panthers
went
by
sound
not
scent
i
blew
another
blast
on
the
horn
and
went
toward
him
for
i
must
not
lose
sight
of
him
if
he
attacked
me
could
i
defend
myself
with
the
hatchet
when
they
found
me
i
would
be
horrible
to
look
upon
and
it
would
kill
elizabeth
will
my
peas
burn
the
flies
will
get
into
that
pitcher
of
cream
if
i
am
killed
they
will
forget
to
put
parsley
in
the
soup
tom
changed
his
weight
from
one
to
the
other
and
gnashed
his
teeth
here
the
king
and
i
are
standing
face
and
face
together
king
tom
how
is
your
majesty
it
mighty
pleasant
weather
so
ran
my
thoughts
in
the
intense
strain
of
that
waiting
it
must
be
full
ten
minutes
before
tom
master
could
get
to
the
house
after
that
first
blast
and
if
he
did
not
hear
that
must
be
too
late
but
tom
kept
his
place
and
my
husband
rushed
by
me
carrying
the
pitchfork
with
which
he
had
been
at
work
and
i
saw
no
more
until
tom
was
in
his
cage
watch
had
dragged
himself
to
his
master
feet
to
die
and
i
went
into
the
house
and
finished
getting
dinner
more
than
ever
afraid
of
tom
and
more
than
ever
at
a
loss
to
know
how
to
get
rid
of
him
yet
he
still
lived
and
rattled
his
chain
by
the
garden
path
but
it
was
a
year
before
our
next
adventure
one
summer
morning
at
sunrise
i
was
shocked
out
of
sleep
by
shrieks
and
shouts
and
scurrying
feet
i
sprang
out
of
bed
and
rushed
into
the
hall
in
time
to
see
tom
dash
out
of
it
into
the
and
the
girl
disappearing
up
stairs
and
the
two
hired
men
through
the
barn
door
my
husband
soon
followed
tom
who
had
taken
refuge
under
a
large
heavy
table
and
seemed
inclined
to
stay
there
this
time
his
collar
was
broken
and
feeling
the
advantage
he
paid
no
heed
to
the
hand
or
voice
of
his
quandom
master
he
would
not
move
but
growled
defiance
and
the
table
protected
him
from
a
blow
under
the
ear
so
his
late
master
became
utterly
nonplussed
if
the
cage
were
there
the
great
beast
would
probably
go
into
it
but
how
get
it
there
the
wealth
of
india
would
not
have
induced
one
of
those
men
to
come
out
of
that
barn
or
one
of
those
women
to
come
down
those
stairs
something
must
be
done
and
i
proposed
to
hold
tom
while
my
husband
brought
the
cage
he
hesitated
i
was
not
in
good
fighting
trim
for
my
hair
which
was
long
and
heavy
had
fallen
loose
but
preparation
could
avail
nothing
the
only
hope
lay
in
perfect
coolness
and
a
steady
gaze
i
knelt
and
took
hold
of
tom
by
the
back
of
the
neck
talked
to
him
and
thought
that
cage
was
long
in
coming
he
shifted
his
weight
and
seemed
about
to
get
up
this
meant
escape
and
i
held
him
hard
commanding
him
to
lie
down
sir
he
blinked
at
me
seemed
quite
indifferent
and
altogether
comfortable
by
and
by
the
man
who
had
ceased
to
be
master
returned
without
the
cage
utterly
demoralized
and
was
here
without
a
weapon
without
a
plan
i
resigned
my
place
and
told
him
i
would
bring
a
rope
this
i
intended
to
do
and
also
my
hatchet
i
had
but
gotten
half
way
to
the
front
door
when
there
was
a
scuffle
the
loud
voice
of
my
husband
shrieks
up
stairs
rattling
of
furniture
and
crashing
of
glass
and
when
i
got
back
to
the
room
i
saw
the
tip
of
tom
tail
disappearing
he
had
gone
through
the
window
and
taken
the
sash
with
him
he
ran
into
his
cage
and
that
was
his
last
taste
of
liberty
but
he
lived
a
year
after
chained
in
a
corn
crib
every
evening
in
the
gloaming
he
would
pace
back
and
forth
raise
his
kingly
head
utter
his
piercing
shriek
then
stop
and
hark
for
a
response
walk
again
shriek
and
listen
while
the
bears
would
bellow
an
answer
the
bears
too
were
often
exciting
and
interesting
once
i
rescued
a
toddling
child
when
running
towards
big
bear
and
not
more
than
two
feet
from
where
he
stood
waiting
with
hungry
eyes
at
another
time
they
both
broke
loose
on
a
bitter
cold
day
when
i
was
alone
in
the
house
i
defended
myself
with
fire
meeting
them
at
every
door
and
window
with
a
hickory
brand
i
wondered
as
they
went
round
and
round
the
house
if
they
would
stop
in
the
chimney
corner
and
make
the
acquaintance
of
tom
but
they
took
no
notice
of
him
and
after
they
had
eaten
several
buckets
of
porridge
they
concluded
there
was
nothing
in
the
house
they
wanted
so
became
good
natured
and
went
and
climbed
a
tree
such
schoolmasters
must
have
imparted
a
flavor
of
savagery
to
my
mexican
war
letters
which
attracted
readers
as
they
did
visitors
chapter
xx
rights
of
married
women
after
mother
death
i
prosecuted
to
a
successful
issue
a
suit
for
the
recovery
of
the
house
in
which
i
was
born
it
stood
on
water
street
near
market
and
our
lawyer
walter
lowrie
afterwards
supreme
judge
was
to
have
given
us
possession
of
the
property
on
the
of
july
which
would
add
eight
hundred
dollars
a
year
to
the
income
of
my
sister
and
myself
but
on
the
of
april
the
great
fire
swept
away
the
building
and
left
a
lot
bearing
ground
rent
property
rose
and
we
had
a
good
offer
for
the
lease
every
one
was
willing
to
sell
but
the
purchasers
concluded
that
both
our
husbands
must
sign
the
deed
to
this
no
objection
was
made
and
we
met
in
william
shinn
office
when
my
husband
refused
to
sign
unless
my
share
of
the
purchase
money
were
paid
to
him
mother
will
was
sacred
to
me
the
money
he
proposed
to
put
in
improvements
on
the
swissvale
mills
these
in
case
of
his
death
before
his
mother
would
go
to
his
brothers
i
had
not
even
a
dower
right
in
the
estate
and
already
the
proceeds
of
my
labor
and
income
from
my
separate
estate
were
put
upon
it
i
refused
to
give
him
the
money
and
on
my
way
alone
from
the
lawyer
office
it
occurred
to
me
that
all
the
advances
made
by
humanity
had
been
through
the
pressure
of
injustice
and
that
the
screws
had
been
turned
on
me
that
i
might
do
something
to
right
the
great
wrong
which
forbade
a
married
woman
to
own
property
so
instead
of
spending
my
strength
quarreling
with
the
hand
i
would
strike
for
the
heart
of
that
great
tyranny
i
borrowed
books
from
judge
wilkins
took
legal
advice
from
colonel
black
studied
the
laws
under
which
i
lived
and
began
a
series
of
letters
in
the
on
the
subject
of
a
married
woman
right
to
hold
property
i
said
nothing
of
my
own
affairs
and
confined
myself
to
general
principles
until
a
man
in
east
liberty
furnished
me
an
illustration
and
with
it
i
made
the
cheeks
of
men
burn
with
anger
and
shame
the
case
was
that
of
a
young
german
merchant
who
married
the
daughter
of
a
wealthy
farmer
her
father
gave
her
a
handsome
outfit
in
clothes
and
furniture
she
became
ill
soon
after
marriage
her
sister
took
her
place
as
housekeeper
and
nursed
her
till
she
died
after
bequeathing
the
clothes
and
furniture
to
the
sister
but
the
sorrowing
husband
held
fast
to
the
property
and
proposed
to
turn
it
into
money
the
father
wanted
it
as
souvenirs
of
his
lost
child
and
tried
to
purchase
of
him
but
the
husband
raised
the
price
until
purchase
was
impossible
when
he
advertised
the
goods
for
sale
at
vendue
the
father
was
an
old
citizen
highly
respected
and
so
great
contempt
and
indignation
was
felt
that
at
the
vendue
no
one
would
bid
against
him
so
the
husband
father
came
forward
and
ran
up
the
price
of
the
articles
when
her
riding
dress
hat
and
whip
were
held
up
there
was
a
general
cry
of
shame
the
incident
came
just
in
time
for
my
purpose
so
i
turned
every
man
scorn
against
himself
said
to
them
gentlemen
these
are
your
laws
your
english
ancestors
made
them
your
fathers
brought
them
across
the
water
and
planted
them
here
where
they
flourish
like
a
green
bay
tree
you
robbed
that
wife
of
her
right
to
devise
her
own
property
that
husband
is
simply
your
agent
lucretia
mott
and
mary
a
grew
of
philadelphia
labored
assiduously
for
the
same
object
and
in
the
session
of
and
the
legislature
of
pennsylvania
secured
to
married
women
the
right
to
hold
property
soon
after
the
passage
of
the
bill
william
stokes
said
to
me
we
hold
you
responsible
for
that
law
and
i
tell
you
now
you
will
live
to
rue
the
day
when
you
opened
such
a
pandora
box
in
your
native
state
and
cast
such
an
apple
of
discord
into
every
family
in
it
his
standing
as
a
lawyer
entitled
his
opinion
to
respect
and
as
he
went
on
to
explain
the
impossibility
of
reconciling
that
statute
with
the
general
tenor
of
law
and
precedent
i
was
gravely
apprehensive
the
public
mind
was
not
prepared
for
so
great
a
change
there
had
been
no
general
demand
for
it
lawyers
did
not
know
what
to
do
with
it
and
judges
shook
their
heads
indeed
there
was
so
much
doubt
and
opposition
that
i
feared
a
repeal
until
some
months
after
kane
came
to
me
and
said
there
is
a
young
lawyer
from
steubenville
named
stanton
who
would
like
to
be
introduced
to
you
i
was
in
a
gracious
mood
and
consented
to
receive
the
young
lawyer
named
stanton
as
he
came
into
the
room
and
advanced
toward
me
immediately
i
felt
myself
in
the
presence
of
a
master
mind
of
a
soul
born
to
command
when
introduced
he
gravely
took
my
hand
and
said
i
called
to
congratulate
you
upon
the
passage
of
your
bill
it
is
a
change
i
have
long
desired
to
see
we
sat
and
talked
on
the
subject
some
time
and
my
fears
vanished
into
thin
air
if
this
man
had
taken
that
law
into
favor
it
would
surely
stand
and
as
he
predicted
be
improved
and
enlarged
i
have
never
been
so
forcibly
impressed
by
any
stranger
his
compactness
of
body
and
soul
the
clear
outlines
of
face
and
figure
the
terseness
of
his
sentences
and
firmness
yet
tenderness
of
his
voice
were
most
striking
and
as
he
passed
down
the
long
room
after
taking
leave
my
thought
was
stanton
you
have
started
for
some
definite
point
in
life
some
high
goal
and
you
will
reach
it
this
was
prophetic
for
he
walked
into
the
war
department
of
this
nation
at
a
time
when
it
is
probable
no
other
man
in
it
could
have
done
the
work
there
which
freedom
demanded
in
her
hour
of
peril
for
this
young
man
was
none
other
than
edwin
stanton
the
ajax
of
the
great
rebellion
chapter
xi
the
pittsburg
saturday
visiter
after
the
war
abolitionists
began
to
gather
their
scattered
forces
and
wanted
a
liberty
party
organ
to
meet
this
want
charles
shiras
started
the
in
the
fall
of
he
was
the
iron
city
poet
author
of
dimes
and
dollars
and
owe
no
man
a
dollar
he
was
of
an
old
and
influential
family
had
considerable
private
fortune
was
courted
and
flattered
but
laid
himself
and
gifts
on
the
altar
of
liberty
his
paper
was
devoted
to
the
cause
of
the
slave
and
of
the
free
laborer
and
started
with
bright
prospects
he
and
fleeson
urged
me
to
become
a
regular
contributor
but
riddle
objected
and
the
had
five
hundred
readers
for
every
one
the
could
hope
in
the
one
i
reached
the
ninety
and
nine
unconverted
while
in
the
other
i
must
talk
principally
to
those
who
were
rooted
and
grounded
in
the
faith
so
i
continued
my
connection
with
the
until
i
met
james
mcmasters
a
prominent
abolitionist
who
said
sorrowfully
well
the
last
number
of
the
will
be
issued
on
thursday
is
it
possible
possible
and
true
that
is
the
end
of
its
first
quarter
and
shiras
gives
it
up
in
fact
we
all
do
no
use
trying
to
support
an
abolition
paper
here
while
he
spoke
a
thought
struck
me
like
a
lightning
flash
and
he
had
but
finished
speaking
when
i
replied
i
have
a
great
notion
to
start
a
paper
myself
he
was
surprised
but
caught
at
the
idea
and
said
i
wish
you
would
you
can
make
it
go
if
anybody
can
and
we
do
all
we
can
to
help
you
i
did
not
wait
to
reply
but
hurried
after
my
husband
who
had
passed
on
soon
overtook
and
told
him
the
fate
of
the
for
this
he
was
sorry
for
he
always
voted
a
straight
abolition
ticket
i
repeated
to
him
what
i
had
said
to
mcmasters
when
he
said
nonsense
then
reflected
a
little
and
added
well
i
do
not
know
after
all
but
it
would
be
a
good
idea
riddle
makes
lots
of
money
out
of
your
letters
when
we
had
talked
about
five
minutes
he
turned
to
attend
to
business
and
i
went
to
the
office
i
found
riddle
in
his
sanctum
and
told
him
the
was
dead
the
liberty
party
without
an
organ
and
that
i
was
going
to
start
the
saturday
visitor
the
first
copy
must
be
issued
saturday
week
so
that
abolitionists
would
not
have
time
to
be
discouraged
and
that
i
wanted
him
to
print
my
paper
he
had
pushed
his
chair
back
from
his
desk
and
sat
regarding
me
in
utter
amazement
while
i
stated
the
case
then
said
what
do
you
mean
are
you
insane
what
does
your
husband
say
i
said
my
husband
approved
the
matter
was
all
arranged
i
would
use
my
own
estate
and
if
i
lost
it
it
was
nobody
affair
he
begged
me
to
take
time
to
think
to
send
my
husband
to
him
to
consult
my
friends
told
me
my
project
was
ruinous
that
i
would
lose
every
dollar
i
put
into
it
and
begged
entreated
me
to
take
time
but
all
to
no
purpose
when
a
bright
idea
came
to
him
you
would
have
to
furnish
a
desk
for
yourself
you
see
there
is
but
one
in
this
room
and
there
is
no
other
place
for
you
you
could
not
conduct
a
paper
and
stay
at
home
but
must
spend
a
good
deal
of
time
here
then
i
suddenly
saw
the
appalling
prospect
thus
politely
presented
i
had
never
heard
of
any
woman
save
mary
kingston
working
in
an
office
her
father
a
prominent
lawyer
had
employed
her
as
his
clerk
when
his
office
was
in
their
dwelling
and
the
situation
was
remarkable
and
very
painful
and
here
was
i
looking
not
more
than
twenty
proposing
to
come
into
the
office
of
the
handsome
stranger
who
sat
bending
over
his
desk
that
he
might
not
see
me
blush
for
the
unwomanly
intent
riddle
was
esteemed
one
of
the
most
elegant
and
polished
gentlemen
in
the
city
with
fine
physique
and
fascinating
manners
he
was
a
man
of
the
world
and
his
prominence
had
caused
his
name
to
become
the
target
for
many
an
evil
report
in
the
bitter
personal
conflicts
of
political
life
i
looked
the
facts
squarely
in
the
face
and
thought
i
have
been
publicly
asserting
the
right
of
woman
to
earn
a
living
as
clerks
and
now
shall
i
shrink
for
fear
of
a
danger
any
one
must
meet
in
doing
as
i
advised
this
is
my
red
sea
it
can
be
no
more
terrible
than
the
one
which
confronted
israel
duty
lies
on
the
other
side
and
i
am
going
over
unto
the
children
of
israel
that
they
go
forward
the
crimson
waves
of
scandal
the
white
foam
of
gossip
shall
part
before
me
and
heap
themselves
up
as
walls
on
either
hand
so
rapidly
did
this
reflection
pass
through
my
mind
or
so
absorbed
was
i
with
it
that
there
had
been
no
awkward
pause
when
i
replied
i
will
get
a
desk
shall
be
sorry
to
be
in
your
way
but
there
is
plenty
of
room
and
i
can
be
quiet
he
seemed
greatly
relieved
and
said
cheerfully
oh
yes
there
is
plenty
of
room
i
can
have
my
desk
moved
forward
and
take
down
the
shutters
when
there
will
be
plenty
of
light
heretofore
you
have
been
jove
thundering
from
a
cloud
but
if
you
will
come
down
to
dwell
with
mortals
we
must
make
a
place
for
you
taking
down
the
shutters
meant
exposing
the
whole
interior
of
the
room
to
view
from
a
very
public
street
and
after
he
had
exhausted
every
plea
for
time
to
get
ready
he
engaged
to
have
the
first
copy
of
the
printed
on
the
day
i
had
set
he
objected
to
my
way
of
spelling
the
word
but
finding
i
had
johnson
for
authority
would
arrange
the
heading
to
suit
i
was
in
a
state
of
exaltation
all
forenoon
and
when
i
met
my
husband
at
dinner
the
reaction
had
set
in
and
i
proposed
to
countermand
the
order
when
he
said
emphatically
you
will
do
no
such
thing
the
campaign
is
coming
you
have
said
you
will
start
a
paper
and
now
if
you
do
not
i
will
the
coming
advent
was
announced
but
i
had
no
arrangements
for
securing
either
advertisements
or
subscribers
josiah
king
now
proprietor
of
the
and
james
mcclelland
called
at
the
office
and
subscribed
and
with
these
two
supporters
the
saturday
entered
life
the
mechanical
difficulty
of
getting
out
the
first
number
proved
to
be
so
great
that
the
forms
were
not
on
the
press
at
by
five
the
streets
were
so
blocked
by
a
waiting
crowd
that
vehicles
went
around
by
other
ways
and
it
was
six
when
the
first
copy
was
sold
at
the
counter
i
was
in
the
editorial
room
all
afternoon
correcting
proof
to
the
last
moment
and
when
there
was
nothing
more
i
could
do
was
detained
by
the
crowd
around
the
doors
until
it
was
after
eleven
editors
and
reporters
were
gathered
in
the
sanctum
and
riddle
stood
by
his
desk
pointing
out
errors
to
some
one
who
should
have
prevented
them
when
i
had
my
wraps
on
ready
to
start
fleeson
then
a
clerk
on
the
stepped
out
hat
in
hand
and
bowing
to
the
proprietor
said
riddle
it
is
your
privilege
to
see
swisshelm
to
her
lodgings
but
as
you
seem
to
decline
i
hope
you
will
commission
me
fleeson
was
a
small
man
and
riddle
had
drawn
himself
to
his
full
height
and
stood
looking
down
at
him
saying
i
want
it
distinctly
understood
that
swisshelm
relations
in
this
office
are
purely
those
of
business
if
she
requires
anything
of
any
man
in
it
she
will
command
him
and
her
orders
shall
be
obeyed
she
has
not
ordered
my
attendance
but
has
kept
her
servant
here
all
the
evening
to
see
her
to
her
friend
house
and
this
should
be
sufficient
notice
to
any
gentleman
that
she
does
not
want
him
during
the
ten
years
we
used
the
same
riddle
was
often
absent
on
the
days
i
must
be
there
and
always
secured
plenty
of
light
by
setting
away
the
shutters
when
i
entered
he
generally
made
it
necessary
for
me
to
go
to
his
house
and
settle
accounts
and
never
found
it
convenient
to
offer
his
escort
to
any
place
unless
accompanied
by
his
wife
the
was
three
years
old
when
he
turned
one
day
examined
me
critically
and
exclaimed
why
do
you
wear
those
hideous
caps
you
seem
to
have
good
hair
riddle
says
she
knows
you
have
and
she
and
some
ladies
were
wondering
only
yesterday
why
you
do
make
yourself
such
a
fright
the
offending
cap
was
a
net
scarf
tied
under
the
chin
and
i
said
you
know
i
am
subject
to
quinsy
and
this
cap
protects
my
tonsils
he
turned
away
with
a
sigh
and
did
not
suspect
that
my
tonsils
had
no
such
protection
outside
the
office
where
i
must
meet
a
great
many
gentlemen
and
make
it
apparent
that
what
i
wanted
of
them
was
votes
votes
votes
for
the
women
sold
on
the
auction
block
scourged
for
chastity
robbed
of
their
children
and
that
admiration
was
no
part
of
my
object
any
attempt
to
aid
business
by
any
feminine
attraction
was
to
my
mind
revolting
in
the
extreme
and
certain
to
bring
final
defeat
in
nothing
has
the
church
of
rome
shown
more
wisdom
than
in
the
costume
of
her
female
missionaries
when
a
woman
starts
out
in
the
world
on
a
mission
secular
or
religious
she
should
leave
her
feminine
charms
at
home
had
i
made
capital
of
my
prettiness
i
should
have
closed
the
doors
of
public
employment
to
women
for
many
a
year
by
the
very
means
which
now
makes
them
weak
underpaid
competitors
in
the
great
workshop
of
the
world
one
day
riddle
said
i
wish
you
had
been
here
yesterday
robert
watson
called
he
wanted
to
congratulate
us
on
the
relations
we
have
for
so
long
maintained
we
have
never
spoken
of
it
but
you
must
have
known
the
risk
of
coming
here
he
has
seen
it
says
he
has
watched
you
closely
and
you
are
an
exception
to
all
known
law
or
the
harbinger
of
a
new
era
in
human
progress
robert
watson
was
a
retired
lawyer
of
large
wealth
who
watched
the
world
from
his
study
and
philosophized
about
its
doings
and
when
riddle
had
given
me
this
conclusion
the
subject
was
never
again
referred
to
in
our
years
of
bargaining
buying
and
selling
paying
and
receipting
chapter
xxii
reception
of
the
visiter
while
preparing
matter
for
the
first
number
of
the
i
had
time
to
think
that
so
far
as
any
organization
was
concerned
i
stood
alone
i
could
not
work
with
garrison
on
the
ground
that
the
constitution
was
for
i
had
abandoned
that
in
when
our
church
split
on
it
and
i
went
with
the
new
school
who
held
that
it
was
then
the
covenanters
before
it
was
adopted
denounced
it
as
a
covenant
with
death
and
an
agreement
with
hell
i
had
long
ago
become
familiar
with
the
arguments
on
that
side
and
i
concluded
they
were
fallacious
and
could
not
go
back
to
them
even
for
a
welcome
into
the
abolition
ranks
the
political
action
wing
of
the
party
had
given
formal
notice
that
no
woman
need
apply
for
a
place
among
them
true
there
was
a
large
minority
who
dissented
from
this
action
but
there
was
division
enough
without
my
furnishing
a
cause
for
contention
so
i
took
pains
to
make
it
understood
that
i
belonged
to
no
party
i
was
fighting
slavery
on
the
frontier
plan
of
indian
warfare
where
every
man
is
all
the
corporals
and
privates
of
his
company
i
was
like
the
israelites
in
the
days
when
there
was
no
king
and
every
man
did
that
which
was
right
in
his
own
eyes
it
seemed
good
unto
me
to
support
james
birney
for
president
and
to
promulgate
the
principles
of
the
platform
on
which
he
stood
in
the
last
election
this
i
would
do
and
no
man
had
the
right
or
power
to
stop
me
my
paper
was
a
six
column
weekly
with
a
small
roman
letter
head
my
motto
speak
unto
the
children
of
israel
that
they
go
forward
the
names
of
my
candidates
at
the
head
of
the
editorial
column
and
the
platform
inserted
as
standing
matter
it
was
quite
an
insignificant
looking
sheet
but
no
sooner
did
the
american
eagle
catch
sight
of
it
than
he
swooned
and
fell
off
his
perch
democratic
roosters
straightened
out
their
necks
and
ran
screaming
with
terror
whig
coons
scampered
up
trees
and
barked
furiously
the
world
was
falling
and
every
one
had
heard
it
saw
it
and
felt
it
it
appeared
that
on
some
inauspicious
morning
each
one
of
of
the
secular
editors
from
maine
to
georgia
had
gone
to
his
office
suspecting
nothing
when
from
some
corner
of
his
exchange
list
there
sprang
upon
him
such
a
horror
as
he
had
little
thought
to
see
a
woman
had
started
a
political
paper
a
woman
could
he
believe
his
eyes
a
woman
instantly
he
sprang
to
his
feet
and
clutched
his
pantaloons
shouted
to
the
assistant
editor
when
he
too
read
and
grasped
frantically
at
his
cassimeres
called
to
the
reporters
and
pressmen
and
typos
and
devils
who
all
rushed
in
heard
the
news
seized
their
nether
garments
and
joined
the
general
chorus
my
breeches
oh
my
breeches
here
was
a
woman
resolved
to
steal
their
pantaloons
their
trousers
and
when
these
were
gone
they
might
cry
ye
have
taken
away
my
gods
and
what
have
i
more
the
imminence
of
the
peril
called
for
prompt
action
and
with
one
accord
they
shouted
on
to
the
breach
in
defense
of
our
breeches
repel
the
invader
or
fill
the
trenches
with
our
noble
dead
that
woman
shall
not
have
pantaloons
cried
the
editor
of
the
big
city
daily
nor
my
pantaloons
said
the
editor
of
the
dignified
weekly
nor
my
pantaloons
said
he
who
issued
manifestos
but
once
a
month
nor
mine
nor
mine
nor
mine
chimed
in
the
small
fry
of
the
country
towns
even
the
religious
press
could
not
get
past
the
tailor
shop
and
pantaloons
was
the
watchword
all
along
the
line
george
prentiss
took
up
the
cry
and
gave
the
world
a
column
leader
on
it
stating
explicitly
she
is
a
man
all
but
the
pantaloons
i
wrote
to
him
asking
a
copy
of
the
article
but
received
no
answer
when
i
replied
in
rhyme
to
suit
his
case
perhaps
you
have
been
busy
horsewhipping
sal
or
lizzie
stealing
some
poor
man
baby
selling
its
mother
you
say
and
you
are
witty
that
i
and
tis
a
pity
of
manhood
lack
but
dress
but
you
lack
manliness
a
body
clean
and
new
a
soul
within
it
too
nature
must
change
her
plan
ere
you
can
be
a
man
this
turned
the
tide
of
battle
one
editor
said
brother
george
beware
of
sister
jane
another
prentiss
has
found
his
match
he
made
no
reply
and
it
was
not
long
until
i
thought
the
pantaloon
argument
was
dropped
forever
there
was
however
a
bright
side
to
the
reception
of
the
horace
greeley
gave
it
respectful
recognition
so
did
willis
and
morris
in
the
henry
peterson
evening
post
godey
lady
graham
and
sargeant
magazines
and
the
papers
one
and
all
gave
it
pleasant
greeting
while
there
were
other
editors
who
did
not
in
view
of
this
innovation
forget
that
they
were
american
gentlemen
there
were
some
saucy
notices
from
john
smith
editor
of
great
a
large
literary
sheet
published
in
cincinnati
after
john
and
i
had
pelted
each
other
with
paragraphs
a
private
letter
told
me
that
she
who
had
then
won
a
large
reputation
as
john
smith
was
celia
who
afterwards
became
my
very
dear
friend
until
the
end
of
her
lovely
life
and
who
died
the
widow
of
another
dear
friend
wm
burleigh
in
the
second
number
of
the
james
mcclelland
as
secretary
of
the
county
convention
published
its
report
and
contributed
an
able
article
thus
recognizing
it
as
the
much
needed
county
organ
of
the
liberty
party
chapter
xxiii
my
crooked
telescope
in
the
autumn
of
robert
mitchell
of
indiana
was
tried
in
pittsburg
in
the
united
states
court
before
judge
grier
for
the
crime
of
harboring
fugitive
slaves
in
an
old
cabin
ten
miles
from
indiana
on
one
of
the
doctor
farms
some
colored
men
had
taken
refuge
and
worked
as
harvest
hands
in
the
neighborhood
to
it
came
the
sheriff
at
midnight
with
a
posse
and
after
as
desperate
a
resistance
as
unarmed
men
could
make
two
were
captured
on
one
of
these
was
found
a
note
kill
a
sheep
and
give
jerry
the
half
mitchell
the
name
of
the
man
who
had
the
note
was
jerry
it
was
addressed
to
a
farmer
who
kept
sheep
for
the
doctor
so
it
was
conclusive
evidence
of
the
act
charged
and
the
only
defense
possible
was
want
of
knowledge
there
was
no
proof
that
mitchell
knew
jerry
to
be
a
slave
none
surely
that
he
knew
him
to
be
the
property
of
plaintiff
who
was
bound
to
give
notice
of
ownership
before
he
could
be
entitled
to
damages
from
defendant
this
defense
judge
grier
overruled
by
deciding
that
no
notice
was
required
the
law
presumed
a
guilty
knowledge
on
the
part
of
defendant
under
this
ruling
mitchell
was
fined
and
the
costs
which
were
additional
his
homestead
and
a
magnificent
tract
of
pine
land
lying
on
the
northern
slope
of
the
alleghenies
were
sold
by
the
sheriff
of
indiana
county
to
pay
the
penalty
of
this
act
of
christian
charity
but
the
said
earnestly
i
do
it
again
if
they
take
every
dollar
i
have
this
ruling
was
alarming
for
under
it
it
was
unsafe
either
to
sell
or
give
food
or
lodging
to
a
stranger
the
alarm
was
general
and
even
men
regretted
that
this
necessary
act
of
justice
should
fall
so
heavily
on
so
good
and
gentle
a
man
there
was
much
unfavorable
comment
but
all
in
private
for
the
pittsburg
press
quailed
before
judge
grier
and
libel
laws
were
the
weapon
with
which
he
most
loved
to
defend
the
dignity
of
the
bench
one
editor
he
had
kept
in
jail
three
months
and
ruined
his
business
hiram
kane
was
a
brilliant
writer
a
poet
and
pungent
paragraphist
and
had
at
one
time
criticised
some
of
judge
grier
decisions
when
by
a
libel
suit
the
judge
had
broken
up
his
business
and
kept
him
in
jail
eighteen
months
public
sentiment
was
on
kane
side
and
he
had
an
ovation
on
his
release
when
he
became
city
editor
of
the
there
was
disappointment
that
i
had
not
criticised
judge
grier
course
in
the
first
number
of
the
but
this
was
part
of
my
plan
in
the
second
number
i
stated
that
there
had
been
for
a
long
time
a
great
legal
luminary
visible
in
the
pennsylvania
heavens
which
had
suddenly
disappeared
i
had
been
searching
for
him
for
several
weeks
with
the
best
telescopes
in
the
city
and
had
about
given
him
up
as
a
lost
star
when
i
bethought
me
of
paddy
who
had
heated
his
and
bent
it
around
a
tree
so
that
he
might
be
able
to
shoot
around
corners
idea
was
so
excellent
that
i
had
adopted
it
and
made
a
crooked
telescope
by
which
i
had
found
that
luminary
almost
sixty
degrees
below
our
moral
horizon
from
this
i
proceeded
to
the
merits
of
the
case
judge
grier
and
mitchell
were
both
elders
in
the
presbyterian
church
the
judge
administered
to
men
the
eucharist
oath
to
follow
christ
then
usurped
the
power
of
the
united
states
to
punish
them
for
obeying
one
of
the
plainest
precepts
of
the
master
the
article
seemed
to
throw
him
into
a
furious
passion
he
threatened
to
sue
riddle
for
having
the
printed
and
sold
in
his
office
and
as
for
me
i
was
to
suffer
all
the
pains
and
penalties
which
law
and
public
scorn
could
inflict
he
demanded
a
satisfactory
retraction
and
apology
as
the
least
atonement
he
could
accept
for
the
insult
these
riddle
promised
in
my
name
and
i
did
not
hesitate
to
make
the
promise
good
my
next
article
was
headed
an
apology
and
in
it
i
stated
the
circumstances
which
had
called
it
out
and
the
pleasant
prospect
of
my
being
sent
to
mount
airy
our
county
jail
in
case
this
my
apology
was
not
satisfactory
i
should
of
course
do
my
best
to
satisfy
his
honor
but
in
case
of
failure
should
take
comfort
in
the
fact
that
the
mount
would
make
a
good
observatory
from
that
height
i
should
be
able
to
use
my
telescope
much
better
than
in
my
present
valley
of
humiliation
indeed
the
mere
prospect
had
so
improved
my
glass
that
i
had
caught
a
new
view
of
our
sunken
star
and
this
dispenser
of
justice
this
gentleman
with
the
high
sense
of
honor
was
a
criminal
under
sentence
of
death
by
the
divine
law
he
who
stealeth
a
man
and
selleth
him
or
if
he
be
found
in
his
hand
he
shall
surely
be
put
to
death
judge
grier

helped
a
gang
of
thieves
to

ancestors
had
been
stolen
in
africa
the
original
thief

all
he
could
sell
the
title
of
a

and
as

not

jerry

heard
of
a
libel
suit
two
years
after
james
mcmasters
was
sued
for
harboring
a
fugitive

to
be
tried
before
grier

spoke
to
his

more
afraid
of

than

the
editor
was
summoned
gave
testimony
and
found
judge
grier
a
most
courteous
and
considerate
gentleman
with
no
signs
of
fear
the
case
hung
on
the
question
of
notice
the
judge
reversed
his
former
decision
and
those
who
were
apt
to
feed
beggars
breathed
more
freely
a
case
was
tried
for
the
remanding
of
a
slave
and

his

clapped
his

this
caught
the
fancy
of

he
was
the
last
pittsburg

who
took

so
advanced
that
there
never

churches
with
three
exceptions
not

neglected
the
weightier
matters
of

were
the
main

the
most
revolting

to
maintain
an
appearance
of

particularly
devout
and
searching
in
the
investigation
of
small
sins
a
religions
contemporary
discovered
that
the
did
actually
advertise
jayne
expectorant
and
such
an
expectoration
of
pious
reprehension
as
this
did
call
forth
the
denied
that
the
advertisement
was
immoral
and
carried
the
war
into
africa
that
old
africa
and
there
took
the
ground
that
chattel
slavery
never
did
exist
among
the
jews
that
what
we
now
charge
upon
them
as
such
was
a
system
of
bonded
servitude
that
the
contract
was
originally
between
master
and
servant
the
consideration
of
the
labor
paid
to
the
servant
that
in
all
cases
of
transfer
the
master
sold
to
another
that
portion
of
the
time
and
labor
of
the
servant
which
were
still
due
that
there
was
no
hint
of
any
man
selling
a
free
man
into
slavery
for
the
benefit
of
the
seller
that
the
servants
bought
from
the
heathen
around
about
were
bought
from
themselves
or
in
part
at
least
for
their

to
bring
them
under

into

nothing

american
slavery
was
ever
known
in
the
days
of
moses
or
any
other
day
than
that
of
this

the

charged
with
being
false
to
the
cause
of

and
of
playing
into
the
hands
of

all
the
editor
had
ever
said
about
that
was
cast
into
its
teeth
by
democratic
liberty
party
and
garrisonian
papers
which
one
and
all
held
that
van
buren
was
a
cunning
old
fox
as
as
in
those
days
when
as
president
of
the
senate
he
gave
his
casting
vote
for
the
bill
which
authorized
every
southern
to
open
all
the
mail
which
came
to
his
office
search
for
and
destroy
any
matter
that
he
might
think
dangerous
to
southern
institutions
in
his
present
hostility
to
slavery
he
was
actuated
by
personal
hatred
of
louis
cass
the
democratic
candidate
and
sought
to
draw
off
enough
democratic
votes
to
defeat
him
the
object
of
the
in
supporting
van
buren
was
to
smash
one
of
the
great
parties
of
the
nation
or
gain
an
balance
of
power
to
counteract
the
slavery
vote
for
which
both
contended
a
few
thousand
reliable
votes
would
compel
one
party
to
take
ground
the
van
buren
movement
was
almost
certain
to
defeat
the
democrats
and
force
the
whigs
to
seek
our
alliance
true
the
free

platform
did
not
suit
liberty
party
men
who
said
it
simply
proposed
to
confine
slavery
to
its
present
limits
and
not
destroy
it
where
it
already
existed
to
all
of
which
and
much
more
the
little
replied
that
with
van
buren
motives
it
had
nothing
to
do
his
present
attitude
was
one
of
hostility
to
the
spread
of
slavery
and
this
being
a
long
step
in
advance
of
other
parties
was
a
position
desirable
to
gain
and
hold
to
decline
aiding
those
who
proposed
to
circumscribe
slavery
because
they
did
not
propose
its
destruction
was
as
if
a
soldier
should
refuse
to
storm
an
outpost
on
the
ground
that
it
was
not
the
citadel
checking
the
advance
of
an
enemy
was
one
step
toward
driving
him
off
the
field

a
rusty
cannon
might
be
worth
several
muskets
in
holding
him
at

the

both
wicked

slavery
was
bursting
her
bounds
coming
over

like
the

one
very
dirty
shovel
might
be
worth
a
hundred
silver
teaspoons
in
keeping
back
the

and
this
free

party
could
do
more
to
check

it

more
perhaps
than

whether
for

henry

the

was
still

with

stepped
in

a

similar

which
the

disposed
of

they
found

in

words
california
was
to
be
admitted
as

upon
condition
of
the
passage
of

which
authorized
the
to
follow

every

this
broad

to
tear
him
from
any

demand
the
services
of
every
good

in
his
hellish

men
by
thousands
once

bowed
abjectly
to
this
infamous
decision
daniel

the
leading

statesman
made
a
set
speech
in
favor
of
thus
giving
up
the
whole
country
to
the
dominion
of
the
slave
power
it
was
another
great
bid
for
the
next
presidential
nomination
which
must
be
controlled
by
the
south
the
danger
was
imminent
the
crisis
alarming
and
the
excitement
very
great
i
longed
to
be
in
washington
so
i
wrote
to
horace
greeley
who
answered
that
he
would
pay
me
five
dollars
a
column
for
letters
it
was
said
that
this
was
the
first
time
a
woman
had
been
engaged
in
that
capacity
i
went
to
washington
in
the
early
part
of
going
by
canal
to
the
western
foot
of
the
alleghenies
and
then
by
rail
to
the
foot
of
the
inclined
plane
where
our
cars
were
wound
up
and
let
down
by
huge
windlasses
i
was
in
a
whirl
of
wonder
and
excitement
by
this
my
first
acquaintance
with
the
but
had
to
stay
all
night
in
baltimore
because
the
daily
train
for
washington
had
left
before
ours
came
i
had
letters
to
the
proprietor
of
the
irving
house
where
i
took
board
had
others
to
benton
henry
clay
and
other
great
men
but
he
who
most
interested
me
was
gamaliel
bailey
editor
of
the
the
great
want
of
an
paper
at
the
capitol
had
been
supplied
by
subscriptions
to
a
publication
fund
and
bailey
called
from
cincinnati
to
take
charge
of
it
and
few
men
have
kept
a
charge
with
more
care
and
skill
he
and
the
had
just
passed
the
ordeal
of
a
frightful
mob
in
which
he
was
conciliatory
unyielding
and
victorious
and
he
was
just
then
gravely
anxious
about
the
great
crisis
but
most
of
all
anxious
that
the
should
do
yeoman
service
to
the
cause
which
had
called
it
into
life
the
had
a
large
circulation
and
high
literary
standing
but
bailey
was
troubled
about
the
difficulty
or
impossibility
of
procuring
tales
southworth
was
writing
serials
for
it
and
he
had
hoped
that
she
a
southern
woman
with
northern
principles
could
weave
into
her
stories
pictures
of
slavery
which
would
call
damaging
attention
to
it
but
in
this
she
had
failed
tales
tales
was
what
the
good
doctor
wanted
temperance
had
its
story
writer
in
arthur
if
only
abolition
had
a
good
writer
of
fiction
one
who
could
interest
and
educate
the
young
he
knew
of
but
one
pen
able
to
write
what
he
wanted
and
alas
the
finances
of
the
could
not
command
it
if
only
he
could
engage
stowe
i
had
not
heard
of
her
and
he
explained
that
she
was
a
daughter
of
lyman
beecher
i
was
surprised
and
exclaimed
a
daughter
of
lyman
beecher
write
abolition
stories
saul
among
the
prophets
i
reminded
the
doctor
that
president
beecher
and
stowe
had
broken
up
the
theological
department
of
lane
seminary
by
suppressing
the
agitation
raised
by
theodore
weld
a
kentucky
student
and
threw
their
influence
against
disturbing
the
congregational
churches
with
the
new
fanaticism
that
edward
beecher
invented
the
organic
sin
devil
behind
which
churches
and
individuals
took
refuge
when
called
upon
to
come
up
to
the
help
of
the
lord
against
the
mighty
but
bailey
said
he
knew
them
personally
and
that
despite
their
public
record
they
were
at
heart
and
that
prudence
alone
dictated
their
course
stowe
was
a
graphic
had
been
in
kentucky
taken
in
the
situation
and
could
describe
the
peculiar
institution
as
no
one
else
could
if
he
could
only
enlist
her
the
whole
family
would
most
likely
follow
into
the
abolition
ranks
but
the
bounty
money
alas
where
could
he
raise
it
where
there
is
the
will
there
is
a
way
and
it
was
but
a
few
months
after
that
conversation
when
bailey
forwarded
one
hundred
dollars
to
stowe
as
a
retaining
fee
for
her
services
in
the
cause
of
the
slave
and
lo
the
result
uncle
tom
cabin
as
it
progressed
he
sent
her
another
and
then
another
hundred
dollars
was
ever
money
so
well
expended
that
grand
old
lion
joshua
giddings
had
also
passed
through
the
mob
and
as
i
went
with
him
to
be
presented
to
president
taylor
a
woman
in
the
crowd
stepped
back
drew
away
her
skirts
and
with
a
snarl
exclaimed
a
pair
of
abolitionists
the
whole
air
of
freedom
capital
thrilled
and
palpitated
with
hatred
of
her
and
her
cause
on
the
question
of
the
pending
fugitive
slave
bill
the
feeling
was
intense
and
bitterly
partisan
although
not
a
party
measure
taylor
the
whig
president
had
pronounced
the
bill
an
insult
to
the
north
and
stated
his
determination
to
veto
it
fillmore
the
was
in
favor
of
it
so
freedom
looked
to
a
man
owning
three
hundred
slaves
while
slavery
relied
on
a
northern
man
with
southern
principles
president
taylor
was
hated
by
the
south
was
denounced
as
a
traitor
to
his
section
while
southern
men
and
women
fawned
upon
and
flattered
fillmore
webster
the
great
whig
statesman
of
the
north
had
bowed
the
knee
to
baal
while
benton
of
missouri
was
on
the
side
of
freedom
the
third
or
party
represented
by
chase
and
hale
in
the
senate
was
beginning
to
make
itself
felt
and
must
be
crushed
and
stamped
out
at
all
hazards
the
infant
must
be
strangled
in
its
cradle
while
abolition
was
scoffed
at
by
hypocritical
priests
as
opening
a
door
to
amalgamation
here
in
the
nation
capital
lived
some
of
our
most
prominent
statesmen
in
open
concubinage
with
negresses
adding
to
their
income
by
the
sale
of
their
own
children
while
one
could
neither
go
out
nor
stay
in
without
meeting
indisputable
testimony
of
the
truth
of
thomas
jefferson
statement
the
best
blood
of
virginia
runs
in
the
veins
of
her
slaves
but
the
case
which
interested
me
most
was
a
family
of
eight
mulattoes
bearing
the
image
and
superscription
of
the
great
new
england
statesman
who
paid
the
rent
and
grocery
bills
of
their
mother
as
regularly
as
he
did
those
of
his
wife
pigs
were
the
scavengers
mud
and
garbage
the
rule
while
men
literally
wallowed
in
the
mire
of
licentiousness
and
strong
drink
in
congress
they
sat
and
loafed
with
the
soles
of
their
boots
turned
up
for
the
inspection
of
the
ladies
in
the
galleries
their
language
and
gestures
as
they
expectorated
hither
and
thither
were
often
as
coarse
as
their
positions
while
they
ranted
about
the
laws
and
constitution
and
cracked
their
over
the
heads
of
the
sent
from
the
northern
states
washington
was
a
great
slave
mart
and
her
was
one
of
the
most
infamous
in
the
whole
land
one
woman
who
had
escaped
from
it
was
pursued
in
her
flight
across
the
long
bridge
and
was
gaining
on
the
four
men
who
followed
her
when
they
shouted
to
some
on
the
virginia
shore
who
ran
and
intercepted
her
seeing
her
way
blocked
and
all
hope
of
escape
gone
with
one
wild
cry
she
clasped
her
hands
above
her
head
sprang
into
the
potomac
and
was
swept
into
that
land
beyond
the
river
death
where
alone
was
hope
for
the
american
slave
another
woman
with
her
two
children
was
captured
on
the
steps
of
the
capitol
building
whither
she
had
fled
for
protection
and
this
too
while
the
stars
and
stripes
floated
over
it
one
of
president
tyler
daughters
ran
away
with
the
man
she
loved
in
order
that
they
might
be
married
but
for
this
they
must
reach
foreign
soil
a
young
lady
of
the
white
house
could
not
marry
the
man
of
her
choice
in
the
united
states
the
lovers
were
captured
and
she
was
brought
to
his
excellency
her
father
who
sold
her
to
a
from
that
washington
she
was
taken
to
new
orleans
by
a
man
who
expected
to
get
hundred
dollars
for
her
on
account
of
her
great
beauty
my
letters
to
the
new
york
soon
attracted
so
much
attention
that
is
was
unpleasant
for
me
to
live
in
a
hotel
and
i
became
the
guest
of
my
friend
emma
southworth
it
was
pleasant
to
look
into
her
great
dreamy
grey
eyes
with
their
heavy
lashes
at
the
broad
forehead
and
the
clustering
brown
curls
and
have
her
sit
and
look
into
the
fire
and
talk
as
she
wrote
of
the
strange
fancies
which
peopled
her
busy
brain
among
the
legislative
absurdities
which
early
attracted
my
attention
was
that
of
bringing
every
claim
against
the
government
before
congress
if
a
man
thought
government
owed
him
ten
dollars
the
only
way
was
to
have
the
bill
pass
both
houses
in
my
letters
i
ventilated
that
thoroughly
and
suggested
a
court
in
which
brother
jonathan
could
appear
by
attorney
greeley
seconded
the
suggestion
warmly
and
this
i
think
was
the
origin
of
the
court
of
claims
there
was
yet
one
innovation
i
wanted
to
make
although
my
stay
in
washington
would
necessarily
be
short
no
woman
had
ever
had
a
place
in
the
congressional
reporter
gallery
this
door
i
wanted
to
open
to
them
called
on
fillmore
and
asked
him
to
assign
me
a
seat
in
the
senate
gallery
he
was
much
surprised
and
tried
to
dissuade
me
the
place
would
be
very
unpleasant
for
a
lady
would
attract
attention
i
would
not
like
it
but
he
gave
me
the
seat
i
occupied
it
one
day
greatly
to
the
surprise
of
the
senators
the
reporters
and
others
on
the
floor
and
in
the
galleries
but
felt
that
the
novelty
would
soon
wear
off
and
that
women
would
work
there
and
win
bread
without
annoyance
but
the
senate
had
another
sensation
that
day
for
foot
in
a
speech
alluded
to
the
gentleman
from
missouri
benton
sprang
to
his
feet
and
started
toward
him
but
a
dozen
members
rushed
up
to
hold
him
and
he
roared
stand
off
gentlemen
unhand
me
let
me
reach
the
scoundrel
everyone
stamped
and
ran
and
shouted
order
the
speaker
pounded
with
his
mallet
and
foot
ran
down
the
aisle
to
the
chair
drawing
out
a
great
and
cocking
it
cried
let
him
come
on
gentlemen
let
him
come
on
while
he
increased
the
distance
between
them
as
fast
as
time
and
space
would
permit
after
the
hubbub
had
subsided

i
saw
the

coming

defalcation
of
daniel
webster
he
whose
eloquence
had
secured
in
name
the
great
northwest
to
freedom
and
who
had
so
long
been
dreaded
by
the
had
laid
his
crown
in
the
dust
had
counseled
the
people
of
the
north
to
conquer
their
prejudices
against
catching
slaves
and
by
his
vote
would
open
every
sanctuary
to
the
bloodhound
the
prestige
of
his
great
name
and
the
power
of
his
great
intellect
were
turned
over
to
slavery
and
the
friends
of
freedom
deplored
and
trembled
for
the
result
there
was
some
general
knowledge
through
the
country
of
the
immorality
of
southern
men
in
our
national
capital
serious
charges
had
been
made
by
abolitionists
against
henry
clay
but
webster
was
supposed
to
be
a
moral
as
well
as
an
intellectual
giant
brought
up
in
puritan
new
england
he
was
accredited
with
all
the
new
england
virtues
and
when
a
southern
woman
said
to
me
in
answer
to
my
strictures
on
southern
men
oh
you
need
not
say
anything
look
at
your
own
daniel
webster
i
wondered
and
began
to
look
at
and
inquire
about
him
and
soon
discovered
that
his
whole
panoply
of
moral
power
was
a
shell
that
his
life
was
full
of
rottenness
then
i
knew
why
i
had
come
to
washington
i
gathered
the
principal
facts
of
his
life
at
the
capitol
stated
them
to
snodgrass
a
prominent
washington
correspondent
whose
paper
had
been
suppressed
in
baltimore
by
a
mob
to
joshua
giddings
and
gamaliel
bailey
they
assured
me
of
the
truth
of
what
had
been
told
me
but
advised
me
to
keep
quiet
as
other
people
had
done
i
took
the
whole
question
into
careful
consideration
wrote
a
paragraph
in
a
letter
to
the
stating
the
facts
briefly
strongly
and
went
to
read
it
to
my
friend
george
julian
i
found
her
and
her
husband
together
and
read
the
letter
to
them
they
sat
dumb
for
a
moment
then
he
exclaimed
you
must
not
publish
that
is
it
true
oh
yes
it
is
true
but
none
the
less
you
must
not
publish
it
can
i
prove
it
no
one
will
dare
deny
it
we
have
all
known
that
for
years
but
no
one
would
dare
to
make
it
public
no
good
can
come
of
its
publication
it
would
ruin
you
ruin
your
influence
ruin
your
work
you
would
lose
your
engagement
by
which
you
are
now
doing
so
much
good
we
all
feel
the
help
you
are
to
the
good
cause
do
not
throw
away
your
influence
does
not
the
cause
of
the
slave
hang
on
the
issue
in
congress
i
think
it
does
is
not
webster
influence
all
against
it
yes
of
course
would
not
that
influence
be
very
much
less
if
the
public
knew
just
what
he
is
of
course
it
would
but
you
can
not
afford
to
tell
them
you
have
no
idea
what
his
friends
would
say
what
they
would
do
they
would
ruin
you
i
thought
a
moment
and
said
i
will
publish
it
and
let
god
take
care
of
the
consequences
good
exclaimed
julian
clapping
her
hands
i
would
if
i
were
in
your
place
but
when
i
went
to
post
the
letter
i
hesitated
walked
back
and
forth
on
the
street
and
almost
concluded
to
leave
out
that
paragraph
i
shuddered
lest
julian
prediction
should
prove
true
i
was
gratified
by
my
position
on
the
the
social
distinction
it
gave
me
and
courtesy
which
had
been
shown
me
grave
senators
went
out
of
their
way
to
be
polite
and
even
men
treated
me
with
distinguished
consideration
my
washington
life
had
been
eminently
agreeable
and
i
dreaded
changing
popularity
for
public
denunciation
but
i
remembered
my
red
sea
and
my
motto
speak
unto
the
children
of
israel
that
they
go
forward
the
duty
of
destroying
that
influence
was
plain
all
the
objections
were
for
fear
of
the
consequences
to
me
i
had
said
god
should
take
care
of
these
and
mailed
the
letter
but
i
must
leave
washington
greeley
should
not
discharge
me
i
left
the
capitol
the
day
after
taking
my
seat
in
the
reporter
gallery
feeling
that
that
door
was
open
to
other
women
the
surprise
with
which
the
webster
statement
was
received
was
fully
equalled
by
the
storm
of
denunciation
it
drew
down
upon
me
the
new
york
regretted
and
condemned
other
secular
papers
made
dignified
protests
the
religious
press
was
shocked
at
my
indelicacy
and
fellows
of
the
baser
sort
improved
their
opportunity
to
the
utmost
i
have
never
seen
in
the
history
of
the
press
such
widespread
abuse
of
any
one
person
as
that
with
which
i
was
favored
but
by
a
strange
fatality
the
paragraph
was
copied
and
copied
it
was
so
short
and
pointed
that
in
no
other
way
could
its
wickedness
be
so
well
depicted
as
by
making
it
a
witness
against
itself
i
had
nothing
to
do
but
keep
quiet
the
accusation
was
made
i
knew
where
to
find
the
proof
if
it
should
be
legally
called
for
and
until
it
was
i
should
volunteer
no
evidence
and
my
witnesses
could
not
be
attacked
or
discredited
in
advance
by
and
by
people
began
to
ask
for
the
contradiction
of
this
vile
slander
it
was
so
circumstantial
as
to
call
for
a
denial
it
could
not
be
set
aside
as
unworthy
of
attention
what
did
it
mean
webster
was
a
prominent
candidate
for
president
would
his
friends
permit
this
story
to
pass
without
a
word
of
denial
julian
was
right
no
one
would
dare
deny
the
charge
he
was
however
wrong
in
saying
it
would
ruin
me
my
motive
was
too
apparent
and
the
revelations
too
important
for
any
lasting
disgrace
to
attach
to
it
on
all
hands
it
was
assured
that
the
disclosure
had
had
a
telling
effect
in
disposing
of
a
formidable
power
which
had
been
arrayed
against
the
slave
as
webster
failed
to
secure
the
nomination
some
one
started
a
conundrum
why
is
daniel
webster
like
sisera
because
he
was
killed
by
a
woman
and
this
had
almost
as
great
a
run
as
the
original
accusation
when
the
national
convention
met
in
pittsburg
in
to
form
the
free
democratic
party
there
was
an
executive
and
popular
branch
held
in
separate
halls
i
attended
the
executive
very
few
women
were
present
and
i
the
only
one
near
the
platform
the
temporary
chairman
left
the
chair
came
to
me
to
be
introduced
saying
i
want
to
take
the
hand
that
killed
daniel
webster
henry
wilson
was
permanent
chairman
of
that
convention
and
he
came
too
with
similar
address
even
greeley
continued
to
be
my
friend
and
i
wrote
for
the
often
after
that
time
chapter
xxviii
fugitive
slave
law
when
it
became
certain
that
the
fugitive
slave
bill
could
pass
congress
but
could
not
command
a
vote
to
carry
it
over
the
assured
veto
of
president
taylor
he
ate
a
plate
of
strawberries
just
as
president
harrison
had
done
when
he
stood
in
the
way
of
southern
policy
and
like
his
great
predecessor
taylor
died
opportunely
when
fillmore
became
president
and
signed
the
bill
when
it
was
the
law
of
the
land
there
was
a
rush
of
popular
sentiment
in
favor
of
obedience
and
a
rush
of
to
take
advantage
of
its
provisions
thousands
of
slaves
were
returned
to
bondage
whigs
and
democrats
were
still
bidding
for
the
southern
vote
and
now
vied
with
each
other
as
to
who
should
show
most
willingness
to
aid
their
southern
brethren
in
the
recovery
of
their
lost
property
the
church
also
rushed
to
the
front
to
show
its
christian
zeal
for
the
wrongs
of
those
brethren
who
by
the
escape
of
their
slaves
lost
the
means
of
building
churches
and
buying
communion
services
and
there
was
no
end
of
homilies
on
the
dishonesty
of
helping
men
to
regain
possession
of
their
own
bodies
all
manner
of
charges
were
rung
about
onesimus
and
paul
became
the
patron
saint
of
among
the
many
devices
brought
to
bear
on
the
consciences
of
pittsburgers
was
a
sermon
preached
as
per
announcement
by
rev
riddle
pastor
of
the
third
presbyterian
church
it
was
received
with
great
favor
by
his
large
wealthy
congregation
was
printed
in
pamphlet
form
distributed
by
thousands
and
made
a
profound
impression
for
pittsburg
is
a
presbyterian
city
and
a
sermon
by
its
leading
pastor
was
convincing
the
sermon
was
an
out
and
out
plea
for
the
bill
and
obedience
to
its
requirements
did
not
paul
return
onesimus
to
his
master
were
not
servants
told
to
obey
their
masters
running
away
was
gross
disobedience
etc
robt
riddle
in
a
careful
leader
in
deprecated
the
existence
of
the
law
but
since
it
did
exist
counseled
obedience
he
was
a
polished
and
forcible
writer
and
his
arguments
had
great
weight
the
published
an
article
on
the
two
riddles
in
which
was
drawn
a
picture
of
a
scantily
clad
woman
with
bruised
and
bleeding
feet
clasping
an
infant
to
her
bosom
panting
before
her
pursuers
up
third
street
the
master
called
on
all
good
citizens
for
help
the
cry
reached
the
ears
of
the
tall
editor
of
the
seated
at
his
desk
he
dropped
his
pen
hastily
donned
his
new
brass
collar
and
started
in
hot
pursuit
of
this
wicked
woman
who
was
feloniously
appropriating
the
property
of
her
master
the
other
riddle
the
presbyterian
pastor
planted
himself
by
the
lamp
post
on
the
corner
of
third
and
market
streets
and
with
spectacles
on
nose
and
raised
hands
loudly
implored
divine
blessing
on
the
labors
of
his
tall
namesake
the
concluded
by
advising
masters
who
had
slaves
to
catch
to
apply
to
these
gentlemen
who
would
attend
to
business
from
purely
pious
and
patriotic
motives
i
did
not
see
riddle
for
two
weeks
after
the
publication
of
the
sketch
and
then
we
met
on
the
street
he
had
never
before
been
angry
or
vexed
with
me
but
now
he
was
both
and
said
how
could
you
do
me
such
an
injustice
why
is
it
an
injustice
oh
you
know
it
is
you
know
i
would
cut
off
my
right
hand
before
i
would
aid
in
capturing
a
fugitive
then
why
do
you
counsel
others
to
do
it
oh
you
know
better
and
rev
riddle
he
and
his
friends
are
distressed
about
it
you
do
not
know
what
you
have
done
i
have
already
had
three
letters
from
the
south
asking
me
to
aid
in
returning
fugitives
and
he
too
has
had
similar
applications
oh
it
is
too
humiliating
too
bad
you
must
set
it
right
i
agreed
to
do
so
and
the
explained
that
it
had
been
mistaken
in
saying
that
both
or
either
of
the
two
riddles
would
aid
in
returning
fugitives
they
both
scorned
the
business
and
robt
would
cut
off
his
right
hand
rather
than
engage
in
it
he
only
meant
that
other
people
should
do
what
would
degrade
him
he
was
not
a
good
citizen
and
did
not
intend
to
be
as
for
his
reverence
he
would
shirk
his
christian
duties
would
not
pray
by
that
lamppost
or
any
other
for
the
success
of
he
had
turned
his
back
upon
paul
and
had
fallen
from
grace
since
preaching
his
famous
sermon
the
gentlemen
had
been
accredited
with
a
patriotism
and
piety
of
which
they
were
incapable
and
a
retraction
was
necessary
but
if
any
other
more
patriotic
politician
or
divine
further
advanced
in
sanctification
would
send
their
names
to
the
it
would
notify
the
south

answering
bible
arguments
as
to
the
righteousness
of

of
was

that
place

he
shall

one
of
thy
gates
where
it

shalt
not

that
old

to
be
the
great
bulwark

the
appearance
of
was
the
signal
for
an
outbreak
for
which
i
was
wholly
unprepared
and
one
which
proved
the
existence
of
an
eating
cancer
of
discontent
in
the
body
politic
under
the
smooth
surface
of
society
lay
a
mass
of
moral
disease
which
suddenly
broke
out
into
an
eruption
of
complaints
from
those
who
felt
themselves
oppressed
by
the
old
saxon
and
ecclesiastical
laws
under
which
the
people
of
the
republic
still
lived
in
the
laws
governing
the
interests
peculiar
to
men
and
those
affecting
their
interests
in
common
with

great
advance
had
been
made
during
the
past
six
centuries
but
those
regarding
the
exclusive
interests
of
women
had
remained
in
since
king
alfred
the
great
and
the
knights
of
his
round
table
fell
asleep
the
slavery
object
of
my
paper
seemed
to
be
lost
sight
of
both
by
friends
and
foes
of
human
progress
in
the
surprise
at
the
innovation
of
a
woman
entering
the
political
arena
to
argue
publicly
on
great
questions
of
national
policy
and
while
men
were
defending
their
pantaloons
they
created
and
spread
the
idea
that
masculine
supremacy
lay
in
the
form
of
their
garments
and
that
a
woman
dressed
like
a
man
would
be
as
potent
as
he
strange
as
it
may
now
seem
they
succeeded
in
giving
such
efficacy
to
the
idea
that
no
less
a
person
than
elizabeth
cady
stanton
was
led
astray
by
it
so
that
she
set
her
cool
wise
head
to
work
and
invented
a
costume
which
she
believed
would
emancipate
woman
from
thraldom
her
invention
was
adopted
by
her
friend
bloomer
editor
and
proprietor
of
the
a
small
paper
then
in
infancy
in
syracuse
and
from
her
the
dress
took
its
name
the
bloomer
both
women
believed
in
their
dress
and
staunchly
advocated
it
as
the
sovereignest
remedy
for
all
the
ills
that
woman
flesh
is
heir
to
i
made
a
suit
and
wore
it
at
home
parts
of
two
days
long
enough
to
feel
assured
that
it
must
be
a
failure
and
so
opposed
it
earnestly
but
nothing
i
could
say
or
do
could
make
it
apparent
that
pantaloons
were
not
the
real
objective
point
at
which
all
discontented
woman
aimed
i
had
once
been
tried
on
a
charge
of
purloining
pantaloons
and
been
acquitted
for
lack
of
evidence
but
now
here
was
the
proof
the
women
themselves
leaders
of
the
malcontents
promulgated
and
pressed
their
claim
to
bifurcated
garments
and
the
whole
tide
of
popular
discussion
was
turned
into
that
ridiculous
channel
the
had
a
large
list
of
subscribers
in
salem
ohio
and
in
the
summer
of
a
letter
from
a
lady
came
to
me
saying
that
the
had
stirred
up
so
much
interest
in
women
rights
that
a
meeting
had
been
held
and
a
committee
appointed
to
get
up
a
woman
rights
convention
and
she
as
chairman
of
that
committee
invited
me
to
preside
i
felt
on
reading
this
as
if
i
had
had
a
douche
bath
then
as
a
lawyer
might
have
felt
who
had
carried
a
case
for
a
corporation
through
the
lower
court
and
when
expecting
it
up
before
the
supreme
bench
had
learned
that
all
his
clients
were
coming
in
to
address
the
court
on
the
merits
of
the
case
by
the
pecks
of
letters
i
had
been
receiving
i
had
learned
that
there
were
thousands
of
women
with
grievances
and
no
power
to
state
them
or
to
discriminate
between
those
which
could
be
reached
by
law
and
those
purely
personal
and
that
the
love
of
privacy
with
which
the
whole
sex
was
accredited
was
a
mistake
since
most
of
my
correspondents
literally
agonized
to
get
before
the
public
publicity
publicity
was
the
persistent
demand
to
meet
the
demand
small
papers
owned
and
edited
by
women
sprang
up
all
over
the
land
and
like
jonah
gourd
perished
in
a
night
ruskin
says
to
be
noble
is
to
be
known
and
at
that
period
there
was
a
great
demand
on
the
part
of
women
for
their
full
allowance
of
nobility
but
not
one
in
a
hundred
thought
of
merit
as
a
means
of
reaching
it
no
use
waiting
to
learn
to
put
two
consecutive
sentences
together
in
any
connected
form
or
for
an
idea
or
the
power
of
expressing
it
one
woman
was
printing
her
productions
and
why
should
not
all
the
rest
do
likewise
they
had
so
long
followed
some
leader
like
a
flock
of
sheep
that
now
they
would
rush
through
the
first
gap
into
newspaperdom
i
declined
the
presidential
honors
tendered
me
on
the
ground
of
inability
to
fill
the
place
and
earnestly
entreated
the
movers
to
reconsider
and
give
up
the
convention
saying
it
will
open
a
door
through
which
fools
and
fanatics
will
pour
in
and
make
the
cause
ridiculous
the
answer
was
that
it
was
too
late
to
recede
the
convention
was
held
and
justified
my
worst
fears
when
i
criticised
it
the
reply
was
if
you
had
come
and
presided
as
we
wished
you
to
do
the
result
would
have
been
different
you
started
the
movement
and
now
refuse
to
lead
it
but
can
not
stop
it
the
next
summer
a
convention
was
held
in
akron
ohio
and
i
attended
hoping
to
modify
the
madness
but
failed
utterly
by
all
protests
i
could
make
to
prevent
the
introduction
by
the
committee
on
resolutions
of
this
that
the
difference
in
sex
is
one
of
education
a
man
stood
behind
the
president
to
prompt
her
but
she
could
not
catch
his
meaning
and
when
confusion
came
she
rose
and
made
a
little
speech
in
which
she
stated
that
she
knew
nothing
of
parliamentary
rules
and
when
consenting
to
preside
had
resolved
if
there
were
trouble
to
say
to
the
convention
as
she
did
to
her
boys
at
home
quit
behaving
yourselves
this
brought
down
the
house
but
brought
no
order
and
she
sat
down
smiling
a
perfect
picture
of
people
thought
the
press
unmerciful
in
its
ridicule
of
that
convention
but
i
felt
in
it
all
there
was
much
forbearance
no
words
could
have
done
justice
to
the
occasion
it
was
so
much
more
ridiculous
than
ridicule
so
much
more
absurd
than
absurdity
the
women
on
whom
that
ridicule
was
heaped
were
utterly
incapable
of
or
unconscious
of
its
need
the
mass
of
nobility
seekers
seemed
content
to
get
before
the
public
by
any
means
and
to
wear
its
most
stinging
sarcasms
as
they
would
a
new
dress
cap
in
those
days
i
reserved
all
my
hard
words
for
men
and
in
my
notice
of
the
convention
mildly
suggested
that
it
would
have
been
better
had
oliver
johnson
been
made
president
as
she
had
great
executive
ability
and
a
good
knowledge
of
parliamentary
rules
this
suggestion
was
received
by
the
president
as
an
insult
never
to
be
forgiven
and
in
the
defended
herself
against
it
i
replied
and
in
the
discussion
which
followed
she
argued
that
the
affairs
of
each
family
should
be
so
arranged
that
the
husband
and
wife
would
be
breadwinner
and
housekeeper
by
turns
day
or
oven
half
day
about
he
should
go
to
business
in
the
forenoon
then
in
the
afternoon
take
care
of
baby
and
permit
her
to
go
to
the
office
shop
or
warehouse
from
which
came
the
family
supplies
i
took
the
ground
that
baby
would
be
apt
to
object
and
that
in
our
family
the
rule
would
not
work
since
i
could
not
put
a
log
on
the
and
the
water
would
be
running
to
waste
all
my
day
or
as
about
the
same
time
stanton
published
a
series
of
articles
in
bloomer
paper
the
in
which
she
taught
that
it
was
right
for
a
mother
to
make
baby
comfortable
lay
him
in
his
crib
come
out
lock
the
door
and
leave
him
to
develop
his
lungs
by
crying
or
cooing
as
he
might
decide
while
mamma
improved
her
mind
and
attended
to
her
public
and
social
duties
against
such
head
winds
it
was
hard
for
my
poor
little
craft
to
make
progress
in
asserting
the
right
of
women
to
influence
great
public
questions
for
something
over
twenty
years
after
that
akron
meeting
i
did
not
see
a
woman
rights
convention
and
in
all
have
seen
but
five
up
to
there
had
been
no
material
improvement
in
them
if
those
i
saw
were
a
fair
specimen
their
holders
have
always
seemed
to
me
like
a
woman
who
should
undertake
at
a
state
fair
to
run
a
sewing
machine
under
pretense
of
advertising
it
while
she
had
never
spent
an
hour
in
learning
its
use
however
those
conventions
have
probably
saved
the
republic
from
the
readiness
with
which
pennsylvania
legislators
responded
to
the
petition
of
three
of
four
women
acting
without
concert
in
the
matter
of
property
rights
it
is
probable
that
in
a
fit
of
generosity
the
men
of
the
united
states
would
have
enfranchised
its
women
masse
and
the
government
now
staggering
under
the
ballots
of
ignorant
irresponsible
men
must
have
gone
down
under
the
additional
burden
of
the
votes
which
would
have
been
thrown
upon
it
by
millions
of
ignorant
irresponsible
women
before
that
time
the
unanswerable
argument
of
judge
hurlbut
had
been
published
and
had
made
a
deep
impression
on
the
minds
of
thinking
men
had
this
been
followed
by
the
earnest
thrilling
appeals
of
susan
anthony
free
from
all
alliance
with
cant
and
vanity
we
should
no
doubt
have
had
a
voting
population
under
which
no
government
could
exist
ten
years
but
those
conventions
raised
the
danger
signal
and
men
took
heed
to
the
warning

of

by
the

of

as
false
to
all
its
professions
when
declining
to
devote
itself
to
its
advocacy
there
were
a
thousand
men
and
women
who
knew
exactly
what
it
ought
to
do
but
seldom
two
of
them
agreed
and
none
ever
thought
of
furnishing

for
the
doing
of
it

insisted
that

here

these

so
let
the
fire
smoulder
out
of

the
policy
of

doing

work
either
mental

physical
and
heaven
defend
them
from
going
into
all
the

the
human
teeth
proved
that
we
should
eat
flesh
and
the
human
form
proved
that
men
should
take
the
ore
out
of
the
mines
subdue
the
inertia
of
matter
and
the
ferocity
of
animals
that
they
should
raise
the
grain
build
the
houses
roads
and
heavy
machinery
and
that
women
should
do
the
lighter
work
as
this
work
was
as
important
as
the
heavier
and
as
it
fell
principally
on
wives
and
mothers
they
in
these
relations
should
receive
equal
compensation
with
the
husband
and
father
by
this
plan
the
estate
acquired
by
a
matrimonial
firm
would
belong
equally
to
both
parties
and
each
could
devise
his
or
her
share
so
that
a
woman
would
know
that
her
accumulations
would
go
to
her
heirs
not
to
her
successor
consequently
every
wife
would
have
an
incentive
to
industry
and
economy
instead
of
being
stimulated
to
idleness
and
extravagance
as
by
existing
laws
women
should
not
weaken
their
cause
by
impracticable
demands
make
no
claim
which
could
not
be
won
in
a
reasonable
time
take

a
good
foothold

suffrage
in

elections
for

holders

could
read
and
had
never
been
connected

was
the
place
to
strike
for
the
ballot
say
nothing
about
suffrage
elsewhere
until
it
proved
successful
here
intemperance
was
then
under
treatment
by
washingtonianism
by
this
philosophy
it
was
held
that
each
man
consists
of
about
thirty
pounds
of
solid
matter
wet
up
with
several
buckets
of
water
that
in
youth
his
mother
and
sweetheart
kneads
rolls
pats
and
keeps
him
in
shape
until
his
wife
takes
charge
of
him
and
makes
him
into
large
loaves
or
little
cakes
according
to
family
requirements
but
must
not
stop
kneading
rolling
patting
on
pain
of
having
him
all
flatten
out
the
diagnosis
of
drunkenness
was
that
it
was
a
disease
for
which
the
patient
was
in
no
way
responsible
that
it
was
created
by
existing
saloons
and
bright
hearths
smiling
wives
pretty
caps
and
aprons
the
cure
was
the
patent
nostrum
of
a
invention
which
like
calomel
seldom
had
any
permanent
effect
on
the
disease
for
which
it
was
given
and
never
failed
to
produce
another
and
a
worse
here
the
cure
created
an
epidemic
of
forgery
falsehood
and
perjury

in

there
was
much
defense
of

to
be

once

with
great
regularity
much
sympathy
was
expressed
for
that
man
and
this
was
amusing
to
those
who
knew
he
could
have
tied
four
such
tyrants
in
a
sheaf
and
carried
them
off
like
a
bundle
of
sticks
but
people
had
found
a
monster
a
giantess
with
flaming
black
eyes
square
jaws
and
big

who
lived
at

of

very
high
and
ate
nothing

the
mother
church
when
the
entered
life
it
was
still
doubtful
which
side
of
the
slavery
question
the
roman
church
would
take
was
in
the
zenith
of
his
power
and
popularity
was
decidedly
and
members
of
catholic
churches
chose
sides
according
to
personal
feeling
as
did
those
of
other
churches
it
was
not
until
that
abolitionists
began
to
feel
the
alliance
between
romanism
and
slavery
but
from
that
time
to
be
a
member
of
the
roman
church
was
to
be
a
friend
of
southern
interests
in
pittsburg
there
was
great
harmony
between
catholics
and
protestants
for
the
by
which
western
pennsylvania
was
so
largely
settled
were
generally
refugees
driven
from
ireland
for
their
connection
with
the
union
or
robert
emmet
rebellion
our
pastor
rev
john
black
escaped
in
the
night
and
he
and
the
only
catholic
priest
in
pittsburg
father
mcguire
were
intimate
friends
the
bishop
of
the
diocese
was
i
think
a
priest
of
the
capponsacchi
order
one
of
those
men
by
whose
existence
the
creator
renders
a
reason
for
the
continuance
of
the
race
after
the
days
of
which
i
write
there
was
an
excitement
in
pittsburg
about
miss
tiernan
a
beautiful
accomplished
girl
who
became
a
nun
and
was
said
to
have
mysteriously
disappeared
when
the
bishop
resigned
his
office
and
became
a
member
of
an
austere
order
of
monks
there
were
not
lacking
those
who
charged
the
act
to
remorse
for
his
connection
with
her
unexplained
death
but
i
doubt
not
that
whatever
that
connection
was
it
did
honor
to
his
manhood
however
it
may
have
affected
his
priesthood
in
the
days
of
his
episcopal
honors
he
was
a
favorite
with
all
sorts
and
conditions
of
men
and
when
he
published
a
letter
condemning
our
of
public
schools
and
demanding
a
division
of
the
school
fund
he
produced
a
profound
sensation
i
think
this
letter
appeared
in
it
was
the
morning
of
one
of
the
days
of
the
week
i
spent
regularly
at
the
office
i
found
riddle
waiting
to
ask
what
i
proposed
to
do
about
it
i
stated
without
hesitation
that
i
would
oppose
it
to
the
best
of
my
ability
when
he
replied
i
took
it
for
granted
that
you
would
have
consulted
white
conductor
of
the
and
we
feel
that
we
can
not
afford
to
lose
our
catholic
patronage
by
taking
issue
with
the
bishop
and
that
it
will
not
be
necessary
you
as
a
pupil
of
black
ought
to
be
able
to
answer
bishop
arguments
and
we
will
leave
him
to
you
the
religious
press
will
of
course
be
a
unit
against
him
and
the
secular
press
need
not
fear
to
leave
the
case
in
your
hands
the
two
papers
for
which
he
spoke
were
the
two
great
whig
dailies
of
the
western
part
of
the
state
the
other
daily
was
the
conducted
by
a
catholic
and
virtually
the
bishop
organ
and
to
meet
this
attack
on
the
very
foundations
of
civil
liberty
the
a
weekly
was
the
only
representative
of
the
secular
press
the
whig
papers
might
have
taken
a
different
course
had
it
been
known
at
first
that
bishop
letter
was
only
a
part
of
a
concerted
attack
and
that
all
over
the
union
the
bishops
had
published
similar
letters
but
this
was
before
the
days
of
telegraphy
and
we
were
weeks
learning
the
length
and
breadth
of
the
movement
bishop
replied
very
courteously
to
my
strictures
on
his
letter
and
we
maintained
the
controversy
for
some
length
of
time
having
all
the
right
on
my
side
i
must
have
been
a
dolt
not
to
make
it
apparent
and
the
friends
of
the
bishop
must
have
felt
that
he
gained
nothing
else
they
would
not
have
been
so
angry
but
he
was
courteous
until
he
dropped
the
subject
my
catholic
patrons
gradually
withdrew
their
advertisements
and
subscriptions
thousands
of
protestants
were
rejoiced
at
what
they
called
my
triumph
and
borrowed
the
to
read
my
articles
very
many
bought
copies
but
i
think
i
did
not
gain
one
subscriber
or
advertiser
by
that
labor
in
defense
of
a
common
cause
nay
i
lost
protestant
as
well
as
catholic
support
for
business
men
did
not
care
to
be
known
to
catholic
customers
as
a
patron
of
a
paper
which
had
strenuously
opposed
the
policy
of
the
church
that
experience
and
a
close
observation
for
many
years
have
taught
me
that
the
secular
papers
of
the
united
states
with
a
few
exceptions
are
almost
as
much
under
the
control
of
the
pontiff
as
the
press
of
austria
nor
is
it
the
secular
press
alone
which
is
thus
controlled
there
are
religions
papers
who
throw
sops
to
cerebus
as
an
offset
to
teachings
demanded
by
protestant
readers
these
sops
are
paid
for
indirectly
by
patronage
which
would
be
withdrawn
whenever
the
bishop
took
alarm
at
an
article
in
that
same
paper
protestants
do
not
carry
their
religion
either
into
political
or
business
relations
and
so
there
is
no
offset
to
the
religious
political
and
business
concentration
of
romanism
there
was
no
other
outbreak
between
me
and
my
catholic
neighbors
until
the
dedication
of
the
pittsburg
cathedral
when
my
report
gave
serious
offense
and
caused
bishop
to
make
a
very
bitter
personal
attack
on
me
he
did
not
know
how
truly
the
offensive
features
of
my
report
were
the
result
of
ignorance
but
thought
me
irreverent
blasphemous
i
had
never
before
been
inside
a
catholic
church
never
seen
a
catholic
ceremonial
did
not
know
the
name
of
a
single
vestment
was
overwhelmed
with
astonishment
and
thought
my
readers
as
ignorant
as
i
so
tried
to
give
a
description
which
would
enable
them
to
see
what
i
had
seen
hear
what
i
had
heard
every
bishop
and
priest
and
member
of
any
religions
brotherhood
in
this
country
and
canada
was
said
to
be
present
some
of
the
things
they
wore
looked
like
long
some
short
ones
some
like
cradle
quilts
some
like
larger
quilts
there
were
many
kinds
of
and
embroidery
some
of
the
men
wore
skirts
and
looked
very
funny
quite
a
number
wore
something
on
their
heads
which
looked
like
three
pieces
of
pasteboard
the
shape
of
a
large
and
fastened
together
at
the
right
angles
and
points
they
formed
into
procession
and
started
around
the
outside
of
the
building
i
thought
of
going
around
and
about
jerusalem
and
the
movement
had
a
meaning
but
they
walked
into
a
fence
corner
swung
a
censor
turned
and
walked
into
another
corner
and
then
back
into
the
house
without
compassing
the
building
i
said
there
was
nothing
to
prevent
bad
spirits
coming
in
at
that
side
i
copied
the
bishop
angry
reply
plead
my
ignorance
and
that
of
protestants
in
general
for
all
that
seemed
irreverent
and
called
upon
him
for
explanations
what
did
it
all
mean
what
was
the
spiritual
significance
of
those
externals
i
ignored
his
evident
anger
had
no
reason
to
be
other
than
personally
respectful
to
him
yet
my
second
article
irritated
him
more
than
the
first
i
had
stated
that
the
men
in
the
procession
were
the
most
set
i
had
ever
seen
that
every
head
and
face
save
those
of
the
bishops
of
orleans
and
pittsburg
were
more
or
less
stamped
by
sensuality
and
low
cunning
in
bishop
reply
he
said
i
had
gone
to
look
for
handsome
men
i
answered
that
i
had
and
that
it
was
right
to
do
so
the
church
in
her
works
of
art
had
labored
to
represent
christ
and
his
apostles
as
men
men
with
spiritual
faces
she
had
never
represented
any
of
her
saints
as
a
a
gross
or
a
crafty
cringing
creature
these
living
men
could
not
be
the
rightful
successors
of
those
whose
statues
and
pictures
adorned
that
cathedral
archbishop
hughes
in
his
sermon
on
that
occasion
had
argued
that
all
the
forms
of
the
church
had
a
holy
significance
what
was
that
significance
moreover
in
the
days
of
john
there
were
seven
churches
whatever
had
the
church
of
rome
done
with
the
other
six
owned
on
the
isle
of
patmos
by
him
who
stood
in
the
midst
of
the
seven
golden
candlesticks
for
two
months
every
issue
of
the
copied
and
replied
to
one
of
the
bishop
articles
but
never
could
bring
him
to
the
point
of
explaining
any
portion
of
that
great
mystery
but
the
discussion
marked
me
as
the
subject
of
a
hatred
i
had
not
deemed
possible
and
i
have
seldom
if
ever
met
a
catholic
so
obscure
that
he
did
not
recognize
my
name
as
that
of
an
enemy
so
bitter
was
the
feeling
that
when
my
only
baby
came
great
fears
were
felt
lest
she
should
be
abducted
but
this
i
knew
never
could
be
done
with
bishop
consent

on

which

already

resolved
upon
and
soon
after
a

convention
in

indorsed
it
by
formal

as

organ
it
did
its
best
to
spread
the
principles
of

you

who
in

given
no
notice
that
they

irresponsible
agents
of

and
therefore
had
no

to
dispose
of
their

they
professed
to
be
entirely
satisfied
with
their
work
and
wages
and
loath
to

them

had
cracked
his

disobedience
was

is
now
on

the
republican
party
was
organized
in
pittsburg
and
when
it
became
national
through
the
philadelphia
convention
in
the
summer
of
and
nominated
fremont
it
seemed
that
it
might
injure
rather
than
aid
the
party
to
have
a
woman
take
a
prominent
place
in
it
the

grown
to

with

had
gone

were

extending

thoroughly
republican

be
ably
conducted
no
further
need
of
a
page
devoted
to
freedom
when
every
page
was
consecrated
to
the
overthrow
of
slavery
before
taking
action
it
was
best
to
consult
an
old
subscriber
charles
sumner
then
on
the
allegheny
mountains
recovering
from
the
assault
i
took
baby
and
went
to
see
him
he
was
domiciled
in
the
family
of
jackson
pennsylvania
state
geologist
and
seemed
to
be
one
of
it
in
the
were
his
desk
and
lounge
where
he
wrote
or
lay
and
talked
principally
with
furness
of
philadelphia
who
was
with
him
devoting
an
store
of
information
to
the
amusement
of
his
friend
jackson
was
full
of
instruction
and
no
man
more
ready
than
sumner
to
learn
he
held
that
all
knowledge
was
useful
in
adding
to
one
resources
inquired
minutely
about
the
shoeing
of
the
horse
he
rode
and
over
a
watermelon
at
dessert
the
doctor
gave
a
lecture
on
amputation
which
became
a
large
capital
to
one
at
least
of
his
hearers
and
was
of
intense
interest
to
sumner
the
children
loved
him
loved
to
be
near
him
and
never
seemed
to
be
in
his
way
once
when
a
toddling
wee
thing
crept
to
his
side
while
he
was
absorbed
in
writing
took
hold
of
his
clothes
drew
herself
to
his
feet
and
laid
her
head
against
his
knee
he
placed
a
weight
to
hold
his
paper
laid
his
hand
on
her
head
and
went
on
with
his
work
when
some
one
would
have
removed
her
he
looked
up
and
said
oh
let
the
little
one
alone
he
spoke
with
profound
admiration
of
purviance
wife
of
the
member
of
congress
from
butler
said
he
was
sorry
never
to
have
met
her
her
influence
in
washington
society
had
been
so
ennobling
that
the
friends
of
freedom
owed
her
a
lasting
debt
of
gratitude
she
boarded
with
her
husband
at
the
national
where
her
wealth
independence
and
sparkling
social
qualities
made
her
a
recognized
leader
while
all
her
influence
was
cast
upon
the
right
side
he
thought
the
success
of
the
north
in
the
famous
struggle
which
elected
banks
speaker
of
the
house
was
largely
due
to
purviance
he
was
oppressed
with
anxiety
about
burlingame
who
had
gone
to
canada
to
fight
a
duel
and
there
was
great
rejoicing
when
he
suddenly
appeared
one
evening
after
the
sun
had
hidden
behind
the
pine
trees
he
and
sumner
met
and
greeted
each
other
with
the
abandon
of
boys
no
duel
had
been
fought
since
brooks
the
challenger
had
refused
to
pass
through
pennsylvania
to
clifton
the
place
of
meeting
for
fear
of
mob
violence
even
the
offer
of
a
safe
conduct
of
troops
by
the
governor
failed
to
reassure
him
and
burlingame
had
hurried
on
to
set
his
friend
mind
at
rest
after
the
general
rejoicing
the
two
sat
facing
each
other
when
sumner
leaned
forward
placed
a
hand
on
each
of
burlingame
shoulders
and
said
tell
me
anson
you
did
not
mean
to
shoot
that
man
did
you
burlingame
head
dropped
an
instant
then
raising
it
he
said
slowly
i
intended
to
take
the
best
aim
i
could
here
he
drew
back
his
right
arm
and
took
the
position
of
holding
a
gun
at
the
broadest
part
of
him
his
breast
wait
for
the
word
and
then
fire
sumner
dropped
back
in
his
chair
let
his
hands
fall
on
his
knees
and
exclaimed
sorrowfully
oh
anson
i
did
not
believe
it
burlingame
eyes
filled
with
tears
and
he
said
charles
i
saw
you
lying
bleeding
and
insensible
on
the
senate
floor
when
i
did
not
expect
ever
again
to
hear
you
speak
and
i
intended
then
to
kill
him
i
tell
you
charles
we
have
got
to
meet
those
fellows
with
guns
some
day
and
the
sooner
we
begin
the
better
on
being
consulted
both
these
champions
of
the
right
said
the
must
not
desert
the
cause
sumner
added
solemnly
the
slave
never
had
more
need
of
it
never
had
more
need
of
you
so
that
editor
went
on
with
her
work
feeling
such
an
opinion
as
almost
a
divine
call
in
talking
with
sumner
during
that
visit
i
learned
that
the
same
doctor
attended
both
president
harrison
and
president
taylor
in
their
last
illness
and
used
his
professional
authority
to
prevent
their
friends
seeing
them
until
the
fatal
termination
of
their
illness
was
certain
also
that
it
was
that
same
doctor
who
was
within
call
when
brooks
made
his
assault
on
sumner
took
charge
of
the
case
and
made
an
official
statement
that
the
injury
was
very
slight
gave
it
a
superficial
dressing
and
sought
to
exclude
every
one
from
the
room
of
his
patient
said
sumner
i
shuddered
when
i
recovered
consciousness
and
found
this
man
beside
me
he
dismissed
him
promptly
and
did
not
hesitate
to
say
that
he
believed
he
would
not
have
recovered
under
his
treatment
when
the
south
seceded
this
useful
man
left
washington
and
joined
the
confederacy
the

very
spirited
a
large
mass

was
held
in

and
cassius
clay
was
the
orator
of
the
occasion
he
was
at
the
heighth
of
a
great
national
popularity
and
seemed
as
if
any
honor
might
be
open
to
him
he
dined
that
evening
with
robert
palmer
of
allegheny
and
a
small
party
of
friends
the
house
was
brilliantly
lighted
and
at
the
table
while
clay
was
talking
and
every
one
in
gala
day
spirits
the
light
suddenly
went
out
and
what
a
strange
sensation
fell
on
one
guest
a
feeling
of
coming
evil
there
was
no
the
gas
had
failed
prophetic
of
the
going

reached
six
thousand
but
was
always
a
heavy
drain
on
my
income
my
domestic
duties
made
it
impossible
i
could
give
any
attention
to
the
business
department
and
i
was
glad
at
the
close
of
the
first
year
to
transfer
a
half
interest
to
riddle
who
became
equal
partner
and
at
the
end
of
the
second
year
he
proposed
to
buy
my
interest
unite
the
with
his
weekly
and
pay
me
a
salary
for
editing
a
page
had
the
proposal
been
made
directly
to
me
i
should
have
accepted
at
once
but
it
was
made
through
my
william
swisshelm
who
had
been
clerk
and
business
manager
of
the
for
eighteen
months
he
advised
me
not
to
accept
said
the
paper
was
netting
fifteen
hundred
a
year
and
that
if
i
would
retain
my
interest
he
would
purchase
riddle
get
type
have
all
the
work
done
in
a
separate
establishment
and
make
it
a
decided
success
i
was
afraid
of
this
arrangement
but
was
anxious
to
keep
up
the
paper
as
a
separate
publication
and
agreed
on
condition
that
he
would
assume
the
entire
financial
responsibility
keep
my
interest
at
valuation
and
leave
me
no
further
risk
than
my
services
if
there
were
profits
we
would
share
them
if
none
i
got
no
pay
as
usual
but
sunk
no
money
to
make
the
changes
he
desired
i
loaned
him
money
until
i
had
most
of
my
small
estate
invested
and
supposed
the
paper
was
prospering
until
suddenly
informed
that
the
sheriff
was
about
to
sell
it
we
transferred
it
to
riddle
with
my
services
two
years
in
advance
to
pay
the
debts
and
i
wrote
for
the
new
york
at
five
dollars
a
column
to
meet
my
personal
expenses
as
my
income
from
my
property
was
gone
i
forget
at
what
time
the
was
united
to
the
weekly
but
very
soon
after
the
presidential
campaign
of
i
learned
that
my
late
partner
had
endorsed
several
notes
which
were
not
likely
to
be
paid
by
the
persons
who
gave
them
and
that
one
of
these
was
already
entered
as
a
lien
against
his
interest
in
the
family
estate
we
had
had
no
settlement
so
i
went
to
my
lawyer
william
shinn
who
said
that
the
entire
interest
of
my
debtor
in
his
father
will
was
worth
less
than
my
claim
since
his
death
without
heirs
before
his
mother
transferred
his
share
to
the
other
heirs
he
advised
me
if
possible
to
get
a
deed
of
that
share
as
the
only
security
for
which
i
could
hope
i
directed
him
to
prepare
it
went
immediately
to
the
office
saw
my
late
partner
and
told
him
that
if
he
did
not
execute
that
deed
i
would
sue
him
for
a
settlement
before
i
left
the
city
he
did
and
i
took
it
home
early
in
the
afternoon
in
march
i
resigned
my
place
on
the
journal
and
feeling
that
my
public
work
was
over
and
that
no
life
save
one
of
absolute
solitude
was
possible
for
me
i
had
lived
over
twenty
years
without
the
legal
right
to
be
alone
one
hour
to
have
the
exclusive
use
of
one
foot
of
space
to
receive
an
unopened
letter
or
to
preserve
a
line
of
manuscript
from
sharp
and
sly
inspection
in
the
latter
half
of
the
nineteenth
century
a
pennsylvania
court
decided
that
a
husband
had
a
right
to
open
and
read
any
communication
addressed
to
his
wife
living
as
i
did
under
this
law
i
had
burned
the
private
journal
kept
in
girlhood
and
the
letters
received
from
my
brother
mother
sister
and
other
friends
to
preserve
their
contents
from
the
comments
of
the
farm
laborers
and
female
help
who
by
common
custom
must
eat
at
our
table
and
take
part
in
our
conversation
at
the
office
i
had
received
read
and
burned
without
answer
letters
from
some
of
the
most
prominent
men
and
women
of
the
era
letters
which
would
be
valuable
history
have
therefore
no
private
papers
and
write
this
history
except
a
few
public
dates
entirely
from
memory
into
the
mists
some
rays
of
light
penetrated
and
by
them
i
saw
that
the
marriage
contract
by
which
i
was
bound
was
that
one
which
i
had
made
and
which
secured
my
liberty
of
conscience
and
voice
in
choosing
a
home
the
fraud
by
which
church
and
state
substituted
that
bond
made
for
saxon
who
ate
boar
heads
lived
in
unchinked
houses
and
wore
brass
collars
in
the
days
when
alfred
the
great
was
king
was
such
as
would
vitiate
any
other
contract
and
must
annul
even
that
of
marriage
but
granting
that
it
was
binding
it
must
bind
both
parties
and
had
been
broken
by
the
party
of
the
other
part
through
failure
to
comply
with
its
requirements
our
marriage
had
been
a
mistake
productive
of
mutual
injury
but
for
one
it
was
not
too
late
to
repair
the
wrong
he
a
man
in
the
prime
of
life
with
unspotted
reputation
living
without
labor
on
the
income
of
a
patrimonial
estate
to
which
he
had
made
large
additions
could
easily
find
a
for
him
one
who
could
pad
matrimonial
fetters
with
those
devices
by
which
husbands
are
managed
my
desertion
would
leave
him
free
to
make
a
new
choice
and
i
could
more
easily
earn
a
living
alone
the
and
birth
of
a
living
child
appeared
to
have
barred
my
appeal
to
this
last
resort
but
the
mother
right
to
the
custody
of
her
infant
is
one
i
would
defend
to
the
taking
of
life
my
husband
would
consent
to
no
separation
and
we
had
a
struggle
for
my
separate
personal
property
or
its
equivalent
a
struggle
in
which
wm
shinn
was
my
lawyer
and
judge
mellon
his
and
in
which
i
secured
my
piano
by
replevin
john
scott
being
my
bondsman
and
learned
that
i
might
not
call
a
porter
into
the
house
to
remove
my
trunk
i
therefore
got
my
clothing
some
books
china
and
bedding
by
stealth
and
the
assistance
of
half
a
dozen
families
of
neighbors
a
test
suit
as
to
my
right
to
support
was
decided
in
and
in
it
a
judge
in
my
native
city
charged
the
jury
that
if
a
wife
have
no
dress
and
her
husband
refuse
to
provide
one
she
may
purchase
one
a
plain
dress
not
silk
or
lace
or
any
extravagance
if
she
have
no
shoes
she
may
get
a
pair
if
she
be
sick
and
he
refuse
to
employ
a
physician
she
may
send
for
one
and
get
the
medicine
he
may
prescribe
and
for
these
necessaries
the
husband
is
liable
but
here
his
liability
ceases
the
suit
was
about
goods
i
had
purchased
by
my
lawyer
advice
two
black
silk
dresses
a
thirty
dollar
shawl
a
dozen
pairs
black
kid
gloves
stockings
flannel
linen
half
dozen
yards
white
brussels
lace
any
one
of
which
would
have
outlawed
the
bill
even
if
i
had
gone
in
an
eden
costume
to
make
the
purchase
but
being
clothed
when
i
made
my
appearance
at
the
counter
the
merchant
could
not
plead
that
i
had
no
dress
and
lost
his
case
in
a
subsequent
suit
carried
up
to
the
supreme
court
and
decided
in
it
was
proved
that
my
husband
had
forbidden
our
merchant
to
credit
me
on
his
account
and
the
merchant
books
presented
in
court
showed
that
for
twelve
years
he
had
kept
two
separate
accounts
one
against
my
husband
and
one
against
me
on
his
were
charged
clothing
for
himself
mother
brothers
and
employes
common
groceries
etc
while
on
mine
were
entered
all
my
clothing
all
tea
white
sugar
all
tableware
fine
cutlery
table
linen
bedding
curtains
and
towels
on
his
were
credits
for
farm
products
on
mine
only
cash
and
he
was
credited
with
butter
and
eggs
on
the
same
day
that
i
was
charged
with
and
towels
my
personal
expenses
from
the
date
of
our
marriage
until
twenty
years
averaged
less
than
fifty
dollars
a
year
all
my
husband
labor
for
all
his
life
and
mine
for
twenty
years
with
a
large
part
of
my
separate
property
had
gone
to
swell
his
mother
estate
on
the
proceeds
of
which
she
kept
her
carriage
and
servants
until
she
died
aged
while
i
earned
a
living
for
myself
and
his
only
child
i
left
pittsburg
with
my
baby
about
the
of
may
and
went
by
boat
to
paul
before
leaving
i
went
to
settle
with
riddle
and
say
goodbye
and
found
him
much
troubled
he
said
why
is
it
i
have
known
nothing
of
all
this
i
did
not
dream
there
was
anything
wrong
in
your
domestic
relations
and
may
have
been
selfish
and
inconsiderate
my
husband
mine
no
more
came
upon
the
boat
while
she
lay
at
the
wharf
held
baby
on
his
knee
and
wept
over
her
when
the
last
bell
rang
he
bade
me
carried
her
to
the
gangway
held
her
to
the
last
moment
then
placed
her
in
my
arms
sprang
ashore
and
hurried
up
the
wharf
he
would
i
think
have
carried
her
off
but
that
he
knew
she
would
break
his
heart
crying
for
mother
before
i
could
get
to
her
he
had
once
taken
her
away
in
a
fit
of
anger
and
walked
the
floor
with
her
most
of
the
night
seriously
alarmed
for
her
life
and
could
not
venture
on
that
experiment
again
he
loved
her
most
tenderly
and
his
love
was
as
tenderly
returned
since
as
a
duty
to
her
i
was
careful
to
teach
her
to
honor
thy
father
on
earth
as
well
as
in
heaven
had
he
and
i
gone
into
the
pine
woods
as
he
proposed
upon
marriage
had
we
been
married
under
an
equitable
law
or
had
he
emigrated
to
minnesota
as
he
proposed
before
i
thought
of
going
there
would
have
been
no
separation
but
after
fifteen
years
in
his
mother
house
i
must
run
away
or
die
and
leave
my
child
to
a
so
i
ran
away
he
thought
i
would
return
enlarged
and
improved
the
house
wrote
and
waited
for
us
could
make
no
deed
without
my
signature
i
would
sign
none
and
after
three
years
he
got
a
divorce
for
desertion
in
he
married
again
and
i
having
voluntarily
assumed
the
legal
guilt
of
breaking
my
marriage
contract
do
cheerfully
accept
the
legal
penalty
a
life
of
celibacy
bringing
no
charge
against
him
who
was
my
husband
save
that
he
was
not
much
better
than
the
average
man
knew
his
rights
and
knowing
sought
to
maintain
them
against
me
while
in
some
respects
he
was
to
me
incalculably
more
than
just
years
after
i
left
him
he
said
to
our
neighbor
miss
hawkins
when
speaking
of
me
i
believe
she
is
the
best
woman
god
ever
made
and
we
would
have
had
no
trouble
but
for
her
friends
my
sister
had
removed
with
her
husband
to
st
cloud
minnesota
and
through
him
i
had
secured
forty
acres
of
land
on
the
shore
of
one
of
a
nest
of
lovely
lakes
lying
on
the
east
side
of
the
mississippi
twelve
miles
from
st
cloud
on
this
little
farm
i
would
build
a
cabin
of
tamarac
logs
with
the
bark
on
and
the
ends
sticking
out
at
the
corners
my
cabin
would
have
one
room
and
a
loft
each
with
a
floor
of
broad
rough
boards
well
jointed
and
a
ladder
to
go
from
one
to
the
other
it
would
have
an
open
a
rough
flag
hearth
and
a
rustic
porch
draped
with
hop
vines
and
wild
roses
i
would
have
a
boat
catch
fish
and
raise
poultry
no
sound
of
strife
should
ever
come
into
my
cabin
but
those
of
waves
winds
birds
and
insects
ah
what
a
paradise
it
would
be
i
had
not
yet
learned
that
every
human
soul
is
a
shunamite
a
company
of
two
armies
and
wherever
there
is
one
there
is
strife
to
live
is
to
contend
and
life
is
finished
when
contentions
end
at
paul
i
took
a
stage
and
night
came
on
when
we
were
still
twenty
miles
from
st
cloud
the
wolves
stood
and
looked
at
the
stage
and
i
knew
they
were
between
me
and
my
hermitage
but
they
were
only
prairie
wolves
and
all
day
my
cabin
had
been
growing
more
and
more
beautiful
the
lakes
the
flowers
the
level
prairies
and
distant
knolls
but
most
of
all
the
oak
openings
were
enchanting
and
in
one
of
these
my
cabin
would
stand
the
passengers
talked
politics
and
i
talked
too
and
one
man
said
to
me
did
you
say
you
were
going
to
st
cloud
yes
well
i
tell
you
madam
them
sentiments
of
yours
wo
go
down
there
lowrie
do
allow
no
abolition
in
these
parts
and
he
lives
in
st
cloud
i
had
had
many
surprises
but
few
to
equal
this
had
heard
of
lowrie
as
a
man
of
immense
wealth
and
influence
but
no
one
had
hinted
at
this
view
of
his
character
i
had
thought
of
him
as
the
friend
of
my
friends
but
as
the
other
passengers
were
confirming
this
account
and
i
watching
the
wolves
there
flashed
across
my
mind
the
thought
this
is
a
broad
country
but
if
this
be
true
there
is
not
room
in
it
for
lowrie
and
me

it
was
midnight
before
we
reached
east
st
cloud
and
the
had
stopped
running
so
that
it
was
a
bright
morning
the
of
june
when
i
found
myself
in
half
a
dozen
pairs
of
loving
arms
in
a
few
days
we
made
an
excursion
to
the
site
of
my
cabin
it
was
more
beautiful
than
i
had

opposite
side
of
the

lived

full

and

my

distant

as

had
lately
killed
two
large
bears
between
his
house
and
the
site
of
mine
there
would
soon
be
no
more

but
i
must
have
the

large
enough
for

beds

a

room
for

would
want
a
place
to
stay
all
night
when
out
hunting
with
his
friends
and
my
hermitage
began
to
grow
into
a
hotel
i
had
commenced
arrangements
with
workmen
when
harry
said
to
me
sis
elizabeth
and
i
have
talked
this
matter
over

you
persist
we
will

of
land
had
and
disposed
of
all
the
government
contracts
he
pleased
traveled
over
europe
with
his
salaried
physician
said
to
this
man
go
and
he
went
to
that
come
and
he
came
and
to
a
third
do
this
and
it
was
done
but
of
all
his
commands
go
was
most
potent
for
as
president
of
a
claim
club
his
orders
to
were
enforced
by
judge
lynch
he
never
condescended
to
go
to
congress
but
sent
an
agent
furnished
all
the
democratic
votes
that
could
possibly
be
wanted
in
any
emergency
and
nobody
wondered
when
a
good
list
came
from
a
precinct
in
which
no
one
lived
republicans
on
their
arrival
in
his
dominion
were
converted
to
the
democratic
faith
fast
as
sinners
to
christianity
in
a
maffitt
meeting
and
those
on
whom
the
spirit
fell
not
kept
very
quiet
people
had
gone
there
to
make
homes
not
to
fight
the
southern
tiger
and
any
attempt
against
such
overwhelming
odds
seemed
madness
for
lowrie
dominion
was
largely
legitimate
he
was
one
of
those
who
are
born
to
command
of
splendid
physique
and
dignified
bearing
superior
intellect
and
mesmeric
fascination
his
natural
advantages
had
been
increased
by
a
liberal
education
he
had
been
brought
up
among
slaves
lived
among
indians
as
agent
and
interpreter
felt
his
own
superiority
and
asserted
it
with
the
full
force
of
honest
conviction
on
all
hands
he
was
spoken
of
as
dictator
and
there
was
both
love
and
respect
mingled
with
the
fear
by
which
he
governed
his
father
was
a
presbyterian
minister
who
taught
that
slavery
was
divine
and
both
were
generous
and
lenient
masters
he
was
the
embodiment
of
the
slave
power
all
its
brute
force
pious
pretenses
plausibility
chivalry
all
the
good
and
bad
of
the
southern
character
all
the
weapons
of
the
army
of
despotism
were
concentrated
in
this
man
the
friend
of
my
friends
the
man
who
stood
ready
to
set
me
on
the
pinnacle
of
social
distinction
by
his
recognition
across
the
body
of
the
prostrate
slave
lay
the
road
to
wealth
and
many
good
men
had
shut
their
eyes
and
stepped
over
the
territorial
government
under
buchanan
was
a
mere
tool
of
slavery
every
federal
officer
was
a
southerner
or
a
northern
man
with
southern
principles
government
gold
flowed
freely
in
that
channel
and
to
the
eagles
lowrie
had
but
to
say
as
to
his
other
servants
come
and
they
flew
into
his
exchequer
so
thoroughly
was
minnesota
under
the
feet
of
slavery
that
in
september
after
we
thought
the
state
redeemed
the
house
of
william
babbitt
in
minneapolis
was
surrounded
from
midnight
until
morning
by
a
howling
mob
stoning
it
firing
guns
and
pistols
attempting
to
force
doors
and
windows
and
only
prevented
gaining
entrance
by
the
solidity
of
the
building
and
the
bravery
of
its
defense
it
was
thus
besieged
because
its
owner
and
occupant
had
dared
interfere
to
execute
the
common
law
in
favor
of
freedom
minneapolis
and
its
anthony
each
had
a
large
hotel
to
which
southern
people
resorted
in
summer
bringing
their
slaves
holding
them
often
for
months
and
taking
them
back
to
the
south
no
one
daring
to
make
objection
until
one
woman
eliza
winston
appealed
to
babbitt
who
took
her
into
court
where
judge
vanderbilt
decreed
her
freedom
on
the
ground
that
her
claimant
had
forfeited
his
title
by
bringing
her
into
a
free
state
at
the
rendering
of
this
decree
rev
knickerbocker
rector
of
the
only
protestant
episcopal
church
in
the
city
arose
in
open
court
and
charged
the
judge
with
giving
an
unrighteous
judgment
he
condemned
the
law
as
at
war
with
scripture
and
the
rights
of
the
master
and
its
enforcement
as
injurious
to
the
best
interests
of
the
community
it
was
the
old
story
of
demetrius
and
the
people
already
keenly
alive
to
the
profit
of
boarding
southern
families
with
their
servants
were
glad
to
have
a
mantle
of
piety
thrown
over
their
love
of
gain
the
court
room
was
packed
and
under
the
eloquent
appeal
of
the
reverend
gentleman
it
soon
became
evident
the
populace
would
make
a
rush
take
the
woman
out
of
the
hands
of
the
law
and
deliver
her
to
the
master
she
and
her
friends
had
about
lost
hope
when
an
unlooked
for
diversion
called
attention
from
them
the
red
head
of
bill
king
afterwards
of
the
house
of
representatives
arose
like
the
burning
bush
at
the
foot
of
mount
horeb
and
his
stentorian
voice
poured
forth
such
a
torrent
of
denunciation
on
such
a
flood
of
solid
swearing
against
the
insolence
and
tyranny
of
ecclesiasticism
that
people
were
surprised
into
inactivity
until
babbitt
got
the
woman
in
his
carriage
and
drove
off
with
her
there
could
no
longer
be
a
question
of
her
legal
right
to
her
own
body
and
soul
but
her
friends
knew
that
the
law
of
freedom
had
lain
too
long
dormant
to
be
enforced
now
without
further
serious
opposition
and
babbitt
brought
into
use
his
old
training
on
the
underground
railroad
to
throw
the
off
the
scent
so
secreted
the
woman
in
the
house
of
stone
and
prepared
his
own
strong
residence
to
bear
a
siege
for
that
siege
preparations
were
made
by
the
clerical
party
during
the
afternoon
and
evening
without
any
effort
at
concealment
and
to
brute
force
the
besieging
party
added
brute
cunning
it
was
known
that
in
my
lecturing
tours
i
was
often
guest
and
might
arrive
at
any
hour
so
shortly
after
midnight
the
doorbell
was
rung
when
babbitt
inquired
who
is
there
mrs
swisshelm
it
is
not
swisshelm
voice
william
griffin
a
colored
porter
is
with
her
it
is
not
william
griffin
voice
then
for
the
first
time
there
were
signs
of
a
multitude
on
the
porch
and
with
an
oath
the
speaker
replied
we
want
that
slave
you
can
not
have
her
a
rush
was
made
to
burst
in
the
door
but
it
was
of
solid
walnut
and
would
not
yield
when
the
assailants
brought
fenceposts
to
batter
it
in
and
were
driven
back
by
a
shot
from
a
revolver
in
the
hall
the
mob
retired
to
a
safer
distance
and
the
leader
mine
host
of
a
hotel
mounted
the
and
harangued
his
followers
on
the
sacred
duty
of
securing
the
financial
prosperity
of
the
two
cities
by
restoring
eliza
winston
to
her
owners
and
made
this
distinct
declaration
of
principles
i
came
to
this
state
with
five
thousand
dollars
have
but
five
hundred
left
but
will
spend
the
last
cent
to
see
babbitt
blood
after
which
heroic
utterance
a
fresh
volley
of
stones
and
shots
were
fired
and
fresh
rush
made
for
doors
and
windows
the
sidelights
of
the
front
door
had
been
shattered
and
one
burly
ruffian
thrust
himself
halfway
in
but
stuck
when
a
defender
leveled
a
revolver
at
his
head
and
said
to
babbitt
who
was
then
in
command
of
the
hall
while
her
husband
defended
the
parlor
windows
shall
i
shoot
him
yes
shoot
him
like
a
dog
but
edward
messer
her
sister
who
knew
babbitt
dread
of
taking
life
knocked
the
pistol
up
and
struck
the
ruffian
head
with
a
stick
when
it
was
withdrawn
and
again
the
mob
fell
back
and
resorted
to
stones
and
sticks
and
oaths
and
howlings
and
gunshots
and
threats
of
firing
the
house
babbitt
thought
that
personal
appeals
might
bring
citizens
to
the
rescue
and
in
an
interval
of
black
darkness
between
lightning
flashes
escaped
through
a
back
cellar
way
and
had
almost
reached
the
shelter
of
a
cornfield
adjoining
the
garden
when
the
lightning
revealed
her
and
three
men
started
in
pursuit
it
was
two
months
before
the
birth
of
one
of
her
children
and
elliott
a
neighbor
who
was
hastening
to
the
rescue
saw
her
danger
and
ran
to
engage
her
pursuers
stumbling
through
the
corn
he
encountered
one
and
cudgeled
him
but
all
were
separated
by
the
darkness
babbitt
however
succeeded
in
reaching
the
more
thickly
settled
portion
of
the
city
and
the
first
man
she
called
upon
for
help
replied
you
have
made
your
bed
lie
in
it
the
sheriff
came
with
two
or
three
men
and
talked
to
the
mob
which
dispersed
before
daylight
with
open
threats
to
have
babbitt
blood
and
for
months
his
family
lived
in
momentary
apprehension
of
his
murder
for
months
he
was
hooted
at
in
the
streets
of
minneapolis
as
nigger
thief
and
called
eliza
no
arrests
were
made
and
he
has
always
felt
it
fortunate
that
messer
prevented
the
shooting
of
the
man
in
the
as
he
thinks
to
this
day
that
in
the
state
of
public
sentiment
the
man
firing
the
shot
would
have
been
hanged
for
murder
by
any
hennepin
county
jury
and
his
home
razed
to
the
ground
or
burned
eliza
winston
was
sent
by
underground
railroad
to
canada
because
minnesota
in
the
year
of
grace
could
not
or
would
not
defend
the
freedom
of
one
declared
free
by
decision
of
her
own
courts
when
such
events
were
actual
facts
in
near
the
center
of
the
state
under
a
republican
administration
what
was
the
condition
of
public
sentiment
in
the
northern
portion
of
the
territory
in
when
there
was
scarce
a
pretense
of
law
or
order
and
the
southern
democracy
held
absolute
sway
i
soon
understood
the
situation
had
known
for
years
that
the
southern
threats
which
northern
men
laughed
at
as
tin
kettle
thunder
were
the
desperate
utterances
of
lawless
men
in
firm
alliance
with
the
hierarchy
of
rome
for
the
overthrow
of
this
republic
chapter
xxxvii
another
visiter
george
brott
was
proprietor
of
lower
st
cloud
and
had
started
a
paper
to
invite
immigration
there
were
two
practical
printers
in
town
both
both
interested
in
its
growth
and
when
the
resources
of
had
been
consumed
and
they
had
had
union
rates
for
work
done
on
it
they
fell
back
on
their
dignity
and
did
nothing
they
had
enlisted
in
the
wrong
army
did
not
belong
with
this
band
of
pioneers
making
its
way
against
savage
beasts
and
men
they
were
soldiers
of
a
union
whose
interests
were
all
opposed
to
those
of
st
cloud
so
they
were
looking
on
waiting
to
see
if
the
great
need
of
a
paper
would
not
compel
their
neighbors
to
pay
tribute
to
their
union
brott
asked
me
if
i
would
take
charge
of
a
paper
and
take
town
lots
for
a
salary
i
told
him
i
was
an
abolitionist
he
laughed
and
said
a
lady
has
a
right
to
be
of
whatever
politics
she
pleases
and
went
on
to
say
that
if
i
could
recommend
minnesota
to
emigrants
and
st
cloud
as
a
town
site
he
cared
nothing
for
my
opinions
on
other
points
he
thought
we
might
unite
all
the
town
proprietors
and
so
raise
money
to
pay
the
printers
so
i
wrote
to
each
one
asking
his
support
to
the
st
cloud
as
an
advertising
medium
all
save
lowrie
were
prompt
in
making
favorable
response
but
from
him
i
had
not
heard
when
there
had
been
three
issues
of
the
paper
brott
was
in
the
office
and
i
said
there
is
one
thing
more
i
feel
that
some
day
i
will
attack
lowrie
who
is
your
friend
he
will
set
shepley
on
me
i
will
make
short
work
of
him
then
we
will
have
a
general
melee
and
i
will
clear
out
that
clique
shepley
is
your
lawyer
and
i
do
not
want
to
use
your
press
in
that
way
without
your
consent
while
i
spoke
his
jaw
dropped
and
he
sat
staring
at
me
in
literal
wonder
then
threw
back
his
head
laughed
heartily
and
said
oh
go
ahead
i
bake
no
bread
in
any
of
their
ovens
very
soon
i
had
a
letter
from
lowrie
saying
i
myself
will
give
the
st
cloud
a
support
second
to
that
of
no
paper
in
the
territory
if
it
will
support
buchanan
administration
otherwise
i
can
do
nothing
i
had
not
finished
reading
when
the
thought
came
now
i
have
you
yet
still
i
knew
it
looked
like
ah
very
like
a
man
catching
a
whale
with
a
fish
hook
secured
to
his
own
person
when
there
were
a
hundred
chances
to
one
that
the
whale
had
caught
him
i
replied
that
the
st
cloud
would
support
buchanan
administration
since
it
could
not
live
without
lowrie
assistance
and
such
was
his
ultimatum
on
the
second
day
after
that
contract
was
made
brother
harry
came
all
trembling
with
rage
and
said
lowrie
is
telling
all
over
town
that
he
has
bought
you
and
that
the
is
to
support
buchanan
it
is
true
was
the
astounding
answer
when
he
said
bad
words
rushed
from
the
room
and
slammed
the
door
then
followed
ten
days
the
only
ones
since
he
became
my
brother
when
he
would
not
call
me
sis
elizabeth
said
i
would
have
seen
lowrie
and
his
money
in
the
bottom
of
the
sea
first
what
would
mother
say
the
next
issue
of
the
made
no
allusion
to
its
change
of
base
and
there
was
plenty
of
time
to
discuss
the
question
those
who
knew
my
record
refused
to
believe
i
had
sold
out
and
took
bets
on
it
however
the
next
number
contained
an
editorial
which
relieved
the
minds
of
friends
but
which
created
the
gravest
apprehension
it
stated
that
the
would
in
future
support
buchanan
administration
and
went
on
to
state
the
objects
of
that
administration
as
being
the
entire
subversion
of
freedom
and
the
planting
of
slavery
in
every
state
and
territory
so
that
toombs
could
realize
his
boast
and
call
the
roll
of
his
slaves
at
the
foot
of
bunker
hill
it
reminded
its
readers
that
john
randolph
had
said
in
the
united
states
senate
when
speaking
to
northern
men
we
have
driven
you
to
the
wall
and
will
drive
you
there
again
and
next
time
we
will
keep
you
there
and
nail
you
to
the
counter
like
base
money
buchanan
a
northern
man
had
fulfilled
the
prediction
henry
clay
had
said
that
northern
workingmen
were
mudsills
greasy
mechanics
and
farmers
these
mudsills
had
been
talking
of
voting
themselves
farms
but
it
would
be
much
more
appropriate
if
they
would
vote
themselves
masters
southern
laborers
were
blessed
with
kind
masters
and
buchanan
and
the
st
cloud
were
most
anxious
that
northern
laborers
should
be
equally
well
provided
for
when
the
paper
was
read
there
was
a
cry
of
sold
sold
lowrie
had
sold
himself
instead
of
buying
the
at
first
there
was
a
laugh
then
a
dead
stillness
of
dread
and
men
looked
at
me
as
one
doomed
chapter
xxxviii
border
ruffianism
in
lowrie
first
ebulition
of
wrath
he
vowed
vengeance
but
an
intimate
friend
of
his
who
had
been
a
democrat
in
pittsburg
begged
him
to
do
nothing
and
said
let
her
alone
for
god
sake
let
her
alone
or
she
will
kill
you
i
know
her
and
you
do
not
she
has
killed
every
man
she
ever
touched
let
her
alone
but
lowrie
knew
it
was
too
late
for
letting
alone
and
sent
me
a
verbal
message
by
one
he
knew
i
would
believe
that
i
must
stop
or
the
consequences
would
be
fatal
stopping
was
no
part
of
my
plan
and
so
i
told
his
messenger
the
second
number
of
buchanan
organ
explained
how
it
was
that
i
became
a
supporter
of
a
policy
i
had
so
long
opposed
lowrie
owned
northern
minnesota
land
and
inhabitants
bought
folks
up
as
fast
as
they
came
to
it
and
had
bought
me
he
was
going
to
support
the
great
power
and
glory
if
it
gave
satisfaction
as
a
democratic
organ
i
would
work
hard
for
the
money
and
it
would
be
odd
if
any
one
gave
buchanan
a
more
enthusiastic
support
than
i
indeed
i
was
his
only
honest
supporter
all
the
others
pretended
he
was
going
to
do
something
quite
foreign
to
his
purpose
while
i
was
in
his
confidence
the
one
sole
object
of
his
administration
was
the
perpetuation
and
spread
of
slavery
and
this
object
the
would
support
with
the
best
arguments
in
its
power
this
was
vitriol
dressing
on
a
raw
wound
and
the
suppression
of
the
was
expected
by
judge
lynch
brave
men
held
their
breath
to
see
me
beard
the
lion
in
his
den
not
knowing
my
armor
as
i
did
then
came
an
announcement
with
a
great
flourish
of
trumpets
of
a
lecture
on
woman
by
the
hon
shepley
the
great
legal
light
and
democratic
orator
of
minnesota
the
lecture
was
delivered
in
due
time
to
a
densely
packed
house
and
was
as
insulting
as
possible
the
lecture
divided
women
into
four
classes
coquettes
flirts
totally
depraved
and
he
painted
each
class
and
found
some
redeeming
trait
in
all
save
the
last
the
speaker
might
as
well
have
named
me
as
the
object
of
his
attack
and
his
charges
thus
publicly
made
were
not
to
be
misunderstood
at
every
point
there
were
rounds
and
shouts
of
applause
by
clacquers
and
brother
harry
once
rose
in
a
towering
rage
but
i
dragged
him
down
and
begged
him
to
keep
quiet
in
my
review
of
the
lecture
i
praised
it
commended
its
eloquence
and
points
but
suggested
that
the
learned
gentleman
had
not
included
all
women
in
his
classification
for
instance
he
had
left
out
the
frontier
belle
who
sat
up
all
night
playing
cards
with
gentlemen
could
beat
any
man
at
a
game
of
poker
and
laugh
loud
enough
to
be
heard
above
the
roaring
of
a
river
in
this
i
struck
at
gambling
as
a
social
amusement
which
was
then
rapidly
coming
into
fashion
in
our
little
city
and
which
to
me
was
new
and
alarming
shepley
pretended
to
think
that
the
picture
resembled
his
wife
and
this
idea
was
seized
upon
as
drowning
men
catch
at
straws
behind
this
they
sought
to
conceal
the
whole
significance
of
the
quarrel
lowrie
cared
not
for
my
attacks
on
himself
oh
no
indeed
he
was
suddenly
seized
by
a
fit
of
chivalry
and
would
defend
to
the
death
a
lady
whom
he
had
never
seen
an
effort
was
made
to
dispose
of
me
by
mob
as
a
means
of
clearing
the
moral
atmosphere
of
the
city
it
was
being
discussed
in
a
grocery
while
tom
alden
lay
on
the
counter
he
rose
brought
down
his
big
fist
and
with
a
preface
of
oaths
said
now
boys
i
tell
you
what
it
is
we
democrats
this
is
a
fight
between
her
and
lowrie
and
we
going
to
see
fair
play
if
she
licks
him
let
him
take
it
no
woman
is
going
to
be
mobbed
in
this
city
so
there
lowrie
hid
an
uncle
who
lived
with
him
a
very
eccentric
man
who
was
greatly
distressed
about
the
affair
and
who
became
a
messenger
bent
on
making
peace
he
begged
me
to
desist
for
lowrie
sake
that
i
might
not
drive
him
to
cover
himself
with
shame
and
bring
lasting
regret
he
insisted
that
i
knew
nothing
of
the
dangers
which
environed
me
i
would
be
secretly
murdered
with
personal
indignities
would
be
tied
to
a
log
and
set
afloat
on
the
mississippi
i
had
no
wish
to
court
danger
shrank
from
the
thought
of
brute
force
but
if
i
let
this
man
escape
his
power
now
tottering
would
be
slavery
triumphant
in
the
great
northwest
minnesota
confirmed
a
democratic
sending
delegates
of
to
congress
to
aid
in
the
great
conspiracy
against
the
nation
life
so
i
told
the
messenger
that
i
would
continue
to
support
administration
that
i
would
pile
my
support
upon
it
until
it
broke
down
under
the
weight
and
sunk
into
everlasting
infamy
the
night
after
i
had
sent
this
as
my
final
answer
to
the
offer
of
leniency
the
was
visited
by
three
men
in
the
wee
sma
hours
anent
the
twal
the
press
broken
some
of
the
type
thrown
into
the
river
some
scattered
on
the
road
and
this
note
left
on
the
table
if
you
ever
again
attempt
to
publish
a
paper
in
st
cloud
you
yourself
will
be
as
summarily
dealt
with
as
your
office
has
vigilance
the
morning
brought
intense
excitement
and
the
hush
of
a
great
fear
men
walked
down
to
the
bank
of
the
great
mississippi
looked
at
the
little
wrecked
office
standing
amid
the
old
primeval
forest
as
if
it
were
a
great
and
the
poor
little
type
were
the
bodies
of
the
valiant
dead
they
only
spoke
in
whispers
and
stood
as
if
in
expectation
of
some
great
event
until
judge
gregory
arrived
and
said
calmly
gentlemen
this
is
an
outrage
which
must
be
resented
the
freedom
of
the
press
must
be
established
if
we
do
not
want
our
city
to
become
the
center
of
a
gang
of
rowdies
who
will
drive
all
decent
people
away
and
cut
off
immigration
i
move
that
we
call
a
public
meeting
at
the
stearns
house
this
evening
to
express
the
sentiments
of
the
people
at
st
cloud
this
motion
was
carried
unanimously
but
very
quietly
and
i
said
gentlemen
i
will
attend
that
meeting
and
give
a
history
of
this
affair
chapter
xxxix
speak
in
public
at
length
the
time
had
come
when
i
could
no
longer
skulk
behind
a
printing
press
that
bulwark
had
been
torn
down
and
now
i
must
literally
open
my
mouth
for
the
dumb
or
be
one
of
those
dogs
spoken
of
in
scripture
who
would
not
bark
the
resolve
to
speak
at
that
meeting
had
come
in
an
instant
as
a
command
not
to
be
questioned
and
i
began
to
prepare
james
mckelvey
a
lawyer
and
nephew
of
my
husband
drew
my
will
and
i
executed
it
settled
my
business
and
wrote
a
statement
of
the
trouble
that
it
might
live
if
i
ceased
to
do
so
then
went
to
bed
sent
for
miles
brown
to
come
to
my
room
and
saw
him
alone
he
was
a
pennsylvanian
who
had
the
reputation
of
being
a
dead
shot
and
had
a
pair
of
fine
revolvers
he
pledged
himself
solemnly
to
go
with
me
and
keep
near
me
and
shoot
me
square
through
the
brain
if
there
was
no
other
way
of
preventing
me
falling
alive
into
the
hands
of
the
mob
my
mind
was
then
at
ease
and
i
slept
until
my
mail
was
brought
in
it
was
a
letter
from
william
shinn
saying
that
without
his
knowledge
my
husband
had
succeeded
in
having
my
interest
in
the
swissvale
estate
sold
at
sheriff
sale
and
had
become
the
purchaser
shinn
added
his
opinion
that
the
sale
was
fraudulent
and
proposed
entering
suit
to
have
it
set
aside
but
i
could
attend
to
no
suit
and
lost
all
hope
of
saving
anything
from
my
separate
estate
surely
the
hand
of
the
lord
lay
heavily
upon
me
that
day
but
i
never
doubted
that
it
was
his
hand
the
good
shepherd
would
lead
me
and
feed
me
and
i
should
know
no
want
when
it
was
time
to
go
to
the
meeting
i
was
dressed
by
other
hands
than
my
own
i
knew
harry
and
my
henry
swisshelm
had
organized
for
defense
and
asked
no
questions
but
went
with
them
elizabeth
carried
her
camphor
bottle
as
coolly
as
if
mobs
and
public
meetings
were
things
of
every
day
life
while
hyke
a
new
england
woman
held
my
arm
saying
we
have
a
nice
time
in
the
river
together
for
i
am
going
in
with
you
they
ca
separate
us
as
we
approached
the
stearns
house
the
crowd
thickened
and
pressed
upon
us
harry
stopped
and
said
gentlemen
stand
back
if
you
please
the
guard
closed
around
me
every
man
with
his
hand
on
his
revolver
there
were
oaths
and
growls
but
the
mob
gave
way
and
made
no
further
opposition
to
our
entrance
the
meeting
was
called
to
order
by
thomas
stearns
the
owner
of
the
house
and
for
whom
the
county
had
been
named
who
with
his
brave
wife
had
made
every
possible
arrangement
for
the
meeting
the
large
parlors
were
packed
with
women
and
every
other
foot
of
space
downstairs
and
even
up
were
filled
with
men
while
around
the
house
was
a
crowd
it
was
a
wonder
where
all
the
people
could
have
come
from
a
rostrum
had
been
erected
at
the
end
of
the
parlor
next
the
hall
but
i
had
no
sooner
taken
it
than
there
was
an
ominous
murmur
outside
and
it
was
discovered
that
my
head
made
a
tempting
target
for
a
shot
through
the
front
door
so
the
rostrum
was
moved
out
of
range
there
was
not
much
excitement
until
i
named
lowrie
and
two
other
men
as
the
persons
who
had
destroyed
the
office
then
there
was
a
perfect
howl
of
oaths
and
lowrie
was
on
the
ground
himself
loading
his
forces
outside
a
rush
was
made
stones
hurled
against
the
house
pistols
fired
and
every
woman
sprang
to
her
feet
but
it
was
to
hear
and
see
not
shriek
harry
held
the
doorway
into
the
hall
henry
that
into
the
dining
room
brown
had
joined
harry
and
i
said
in
a
low
concentrated
voice
brown
he
turned
and
pressed
up
to
the
rostrum
do
fail
me
do
leave
me
remember
i
remember
do
be
afraid
i
do
it
but
i
going
to
do
some
other
shooting
first
save
two
bullets
for
me
i
plead
and
shoot
so
that
i
can
see
you
i
will
i
will
but
all
the
time
he
was
looking
to
the
door
hyke
was
clinging
to
me
sobbing
we
go
together
no
one
can
part
us
the
mob
were
pressed
back
and
comparative
quiet
restored
and
when
i
finished
the
reading
of
my
address
i
began
to
extemporize
what
i
said
seemed
to
be
the
right
words
at
the
right
time
a
hushed
attention
fell
upon
the
audience
inside
and
out
then
there
was
applause
inside
which
called
forth
howls
from
the
outside
and
when
i
stepped
from
the
platform
i
was
overwhelmed
with
congratulations
and
more
astonished
than
any
one
to
learn
that
i
could
speak
in
public
barrett
a
young
civil
engineer
was
chairman
of
the
committee
on
resolutions
and
brought
in
a
set
which
thrilled
the
audience
they
were
a
most
indignant
denunciation
of
the
destruction
of
the
office
an
enthusiastic
endorsement
of
the
course
of
the
and
a
determination
to
it
under
the
sole
control
of
its
editor
they
were
passed
singly
by
acclamation
until
the
last
when
i
protested
that
they
should
take
time
to
think
should
consider
if
it
were
not
better
to
get
another
editor
there
could
be
no
peace
with
me
in
the
editorial
chair
for
i
was
an
abolitionist
and
would
light
slavery
and
to
the
death
and
after
it
there
was
a
universal
response
of
good
good
give
it
to
and
we
stand
by
you
this
was
the
beginning
of
the
final
triumph
of
free
speech
but
the
end
was
yet
in
the
dim
distance
and
this
i
knew
then
as
well
as
afterwards
barrett
who
carried
that
meeting
is
the
man
who
fought
the
last
battle
of
the
rebellion
at
the
head
of
his
negro
troops
away
down
in
texas
ten
days
after
lee
surrender
and
before
that
news
had
reached
him
brown
was
charged
with
cowardice
in
having
kept
back
among
the
women
and
i
had
to
explain
on
his
account
chapter
xl
a
famous
victory
the
day
after
the
stearns
house
meeting
i
was
thought
to
be
dying
all
that
medical
skill
and
loving
hands
could
do
was
done
to
draw
me
from
the
dark
valley
into
which
i
seemed
to
have
passed
while
those
men
who
had
planted
themselves
and
their
rifles
between
me
and
death
by
violence
came
on
to
know
if
i
yet
lived
when
i
was
able
to
be
out
it
was
not
thought
safe
for
me
to
do
so
not
even
to
cross
the
street
and
sit
on
the
high
green
bank
which
overlooked
the
river
harry
was
constantly
armed
and
on
guard
and
a
pistol
shot
from
his
house
night
or
day
would
have
brought
a
score
of
armed
men
in
a
very
short
time
a
printing
company
had
been
formed
to
the
in
it
were
forty
good
men
and
true
and
they
sent
an
agent
to
chicago
to
buy
press
and
type
the
st
cloud
was
to
begin
a
new
life
as
the
mouthpiece
of
the
republican
party
and
i
was
no
longer
a
scout
conducting
a
war
on
the
only
rational
plan
of
indian
warfare
i
begged
my
friends
to
stand
abide
and
leave
lowrie
and
me
to
settle
the
trouble
saying
to
them
i
can
not
fight
behind
ramparts
of
friends
i
must
take
the
risks
myself
must
have
an
open
field
protect
me
from
brute
force
and
give
me
moral
aid
but
stand
aside
but
they
were
full
of
enthusiasm
and
would
bear
the
brunt
of
battle
there
were
open
threats
of
the
destruction
of
the
new
press
and
it
was
no
time
to
quit
the
field
of
the
first
number
of
the
resurrected
the
st
cloud
printing
was
publisher
and
i
sole
editor
i
prepared
the
contents
very
carefully
that
they
might
not
give
unnecessary
offense
dropped
the
role
of
supporting
buchanan
and
tried
to
make
a
strong
republican
paper
of
the
abolition
type
and
in
the
leader
gave
a
history
of
the
destruction
of
my
office
the
paper
gave
great
satisfaction
to
the
publishers
who
had
not
thought
i
could
be
so
calm
but
lowrie
threatened
a
libel
suit
for
my
history
of
that
outrage
and
i
said
to
the
printing
company
you
must
get
out
of
my
way
or
i
will
withdraw
at
once
they
gave
me
a
bill
of
sale
for
the
press
and
material
and
of
the
second
number
i
was
sole
editor
and
proprietor
but
it
was
too
late
the
libel
suit
was
brought
damages
laid
at
and
every
lawyer
in
that
upper
country
retained
for
the
prosecution
this
was
in
the
spring
of
the
two
years
previous
the
country
had
been
devastated
by
grasshoppers
and
no
green
thing
had
escaped
there
was
no
old
grain
the
mass
of
people
had
been
speculating
in
town
lots
and
such
had
been
the
demand
for
city
charters
that
a
wag
moved
in
legislature
to
reserve
of
the
land
of
minnesota
for
agricultural
purposes
the
territorial
had
just
been
exchanged
for
a
state
government
which
was
not
yet
in
working
order
the
capital
of
every
man
in
the
printing
company
was
buried
in
corner
lots
or
lots
which
were
not
on
a
corner
the
wolves
and
bears
cared
nothing
for
surveyor
stakes
and
held
possession
of
most
of
the
cities
howling
defiance
at
the
march
of
civilization
the
troops
were
still
in
kansas
establishing
slavery
and
we
lived
in
a
constant
state
of
alarm
the
men
were
organized
for
defense
against
indians
and
must
do
picket
duty
all
the
money
was
in
the
hands
of
the
enemy
citizens
had
everything
to
buy
and
nothing
to
buy
it
with
provisions
were
brought
up
from
paul
by
wagon
except
when
a
boat
could
come
from
anthony
those
men
of
the
company
who
were
especially
marked
were
men
of
families
and
it
is
hard
to
starve
children
for
the
freedom
of
the
press
the
nearest
court
was
anthony
any
defense
of
that
suit
must
be
ruinous
to
those
men
and
i
advised
them
to
compromise
a
committee
was
appointed
to
meet
six
lawyers
and
were
in
despair
when
they
learned
the
ultimatum
of
the
great
dictator
with
the
terms
demanded
they
had
no
inclination
to
comply
but
sent
fowler
to
me
with
the
contract
they
were
required
to
sign
this
bound
the
company
in
a
bond
of
actual
payment
that
the
cloud
should
publish
in
its
columns
a
card
from
shepley
of
which
a
copy
was
appended
and
which
stated
that
the
destruction
of
the
office
was
not
for
any
political
cause
but
was
solely
on
account
of
an
attack
made
by
its
editor
on
the
reputation
of
a
lady
also
that
said
should
never
again
discuss
or
refer
to
the
destruction
of
its
office
fowler
burned
with
indignation
and
was
much
surprised
when
i
returned
the
paper
saying
that
i
would
comply
with
these
demands
he
protested
that
i
should
not
that
they
had
set
out
to
defend
the
freedom
of
the
press
which
you
can
not
do
i
remarked
you
sign
that
paper
just
as
you
would
hand
your
money
to
a
robber
who
held
a
pistol
to
your
head
and
demanded
it
there
is
a
point
at
which
the
bravest
must
yield
where
resistance
is
madness
and
you
have
reached
this
point
the
press
is
mine
leave
its
freedom
to
me
defend
me
from
brute
force
and
do
your
duty
to
your
families
he
returned
to
the
consultation
room
where
every
one
was
surprised
at
my
compliance
they
had
all
given
me
credit
for
more
pluck
but
since
i
surrendered
the
case
was
lost
the
contract
was
signed
the
bond
executed
and
everything
made
tight
and
fast
as
law
could
make
it
the
friends
of

were
indignant
but
bided
their
time
stephen
miller
a
nephew
of
my
and
afterwards
governor
of
minnesota
was
on
a
visit
to
harrisburg
during
all
this
trouble
and
when
he
returned
he
flew
into
a
towering
rage
over
what
he
termed
the
cowardly
backdown
of
the
printing
company
and
published
a
card
in
the
paul
papers
washing
his
hands
of
it
but
to
the
victors
belong
the
spoils
and
glory
and
now
they
made
much
of
them
ladies
got
out
their
silks
their
jewels
and
their
laces
there
were
sounds
of
revelry
by
night
where
fair
women
and
gallant
men
drew
around
the
social
board
on
which
sparkled
the
and
glimmered
the
yellow
gold
to
be
taken
up
by
the
winner
champagne
was
drunk
in
honor
of
the
famous
victory
hands
were
shaken
over
it
stray
sheep
were
brought
back
into
the
true
democratic
fold
and
late
opinions
about
presses
and
types
were
forgotten
though
among
all
the
rejoicings
the
bar
had
the
best
of
it
for
once
its
members
had
not
been
like
the
blades
of
a

of

had
not
even
seemed
to
cut

while
only
cutting
that
which
came
between

its
members
were
a
band
of
brothers
concentrated
into
one
sharp
keen
dagger
with
which
they
had
stabbed
freedom
to
the
heart
that
triumphant
bar
stroked
its
bearded
chin
and
parted
its
silky
mustache

they
were
the
generals
who
had
won
this
famous
victory
and
wore
their
laurels
with
a
jaunty
air
while
a
learned
and
distinguished
divine
from
the
center
of
the
state
in
a
sermon
congratulated
the
lord
on
having
succeeded
in
restoring
peace
to
this
community
lately
torn
by
dissensions
and
all
was
quiet
on
the
mississippi
on
its
bank
sat
poor
little
i
looking
out
on
its
solemn
march
to
the
sea
thinking
of
minnesota
sending
a
wail
upon
its
bosom
to
meet
and
mingle
with
that
borne
by
the
missouri
from
kansas
thinking
of
a
slave
who
landed
with
her
babe
in
her
arms
here
just
in
front
of
my
unfinished
loft
performed
the
labor
of
a
slave
in
this
free
northern
land
and
embarked
from
this
same
landing
to
go
to
a
tennessee
auction
block
nobody
saying
to
the
master
why
do
ye
this
against
the
power
which
thus
trampled
constitutional
guarantees
congressional
enactments
and
state
rights
in
the
dust
i
seemed
to
stand
alone
with
my
hands
tied
stood
in
a
body
weighing
just
one
hundred
pounds
and
kept
in
it
by
the
most
assiduous
care
i
was
learning
to
set
type
and
as
i
picked
the
bits
of
lead
from
the
labeled
boxes
there
ran
the
old
tune
of
thomas
carrying
through
my
brain
these
words
yea
though
i
walk
in
death
dark
vale
yet
will
i
fear
none
why
did
the
heathen
rage
and
kings
vex
themselves
god
even
our
god
should
dash
them
together
like
potsherds
what
an
uneven
fight
it
was
god
and
i
against
that
little
clique
against
a
world
i
rented
the
office
to
the
boys
who
at
once
gave
me
notice
that
i
was
no
longer
wanted
in
it
they
issued
a
with
the
devil
as
editor
and
proprietor
his
salutatory
informed
his
readers
that
he
was
in
full
possession
and
was
going
to
have
a
good
time
had
taught
the
to
lie
and
was
going
to
tunnel
the
mississippi
those
were
bright
boys
and
they
had
a
jolly
week
shepley
card
appeared
as
per
agreement
and
thus
far
the
terms
of
release
for
the
printing
company
complied
with
and
the
contract
with
the
filled
but
what
next
had
i
actually
given
up
the
publication
of
course
i
had
its
finances
were
desperate
and
what
else
could
i
do
what
motive
could
i
have
for
attempting
to
go
on
with
it
oh
what
a
famous
victory
the
next
publication
day
passed
and
no
there
was
a
dress
parade
of
triumphant
troops
and
that
most
famous
victory
was
bearing
fruit
next
day
the
cloud
made
its
appearance
and
i
was
sole
editor
and
proprietor
into
the
first
editorial
column
i
copied
verbatim
with
a
prominent
heading
the
article
from
the
on
which
the
libel
suit
was
founded
and
gave
notice
that
i
alone
was
pecuniarily
responsible
for
all
the
injury
that
could
possibly
be
done
to
the
characters
of
all
the
men
who
might
feel
themselves
aggrieved
thereby
of
the
late
i
had
an
obituary
gave
a
short
sketch
of
its
stormy
life
how
it
was
insulted
overborne
enslaved
that
it
could
not
live
a
slave
and
died
in
its
new
chains
it
seems
strange
that
those
lawyers
should
have
been
so
stupid
or
should
have
accredited
me
with
such
amazing
stupidity
when
they
drew
up
that
bond
but
so
it
was
and
the
tables
were
completely
turned
to
sue
me
for
libel
was
folly
for
in
paul
or
anthony
i
should
have
had
the
gratuitous
services
of
the
best
legal
talent
in
the
state
and
they
and
their
case
would
have
been
ground
into
very
small
and
dirty
dust
no
famous
victory
was
ever
before
turned
into
a
more
total
rout
by
a
more
simple
ambush
and
by
it
i
won
the
clear
field
necessary
to
the
continuance
of
my
work
i
still
had
protection
from
physical
violence
but
had
no
fear
of
legal
molestation
and
after
the
next
fall
election
border
ruffianism
fell
into
such
disrepute
in
st
cloud
that
loaded
guns
seemed
no
longer
necessary
to
sustain
the
freedom
of

chapter
xli
state
and
national
politics
when
st
cloud
began
its
career
as
the
organ
of
the
republican
party
in
northern
minnesota
the
central
and
southern
portions
of
the
state
were
fairly
supplied
with
republican
papers
the
conductors
all
being
more
or
less
skillful
in
the
art
of
plowing
and
sowing
the
political
field
but
with
no
very
bright
prospect
of
harvesting
a
victory
under
the
lowrie
dictatorship
of
the
north
it
is
difficult
to
see
how
the
success
of
a
republican
could
have
been
made
possible
any
more
than
giving
the
electoral
vote
of
southern
republican
states
to
the
republican
candidate
in
to
overthrow
that
dictatorship
was
the
work
i
had
volunteered
to
do
and
in
doing
it
my
plan
was
to
plow
deep
subsoil
to
the
beam
preachers
held
men
accountable
to
god
for
their
sunday
services
but
it
was
my
aim
to
urge
the
divine
claim
to
obedience
all
the
rest
of
the
week
i
held
that
election
day
was
of
all
others
the
lord
day
he
instituted
the
first
republic
all
the
training
which
moses
gave
the
jews
was
to
fit
them
for
and
at
his
death
the
choice
of
their
rulers
was
left
with
them
and
they
were
commanded
to
choose
men
fearing
god
and
hating
covetousness
and
set
them
to
rule
over
you
for
no
creed
no
form
of
worship
no
act
of
his
life
is
a
man
more
directly
responsible
to
god
than
for
casting
his
vote
or
the
of
that
duty
when
the
nominations
were
made
for
the
second
state
election
in
lowrie
had
lost
ground
so
fast
that
he
needed
the
indorsement
of
his
party
this
was
given
in
his
nomination
for
lieut
governor
the
republicans
nominated
ignatius
donnelly
a
fiery
young
orator
who
took
the
stump
and
was
not
deterred
by
any
from
making
the
most
of
his
opponent
reputation
as
the
stealthy
destroyer
of
a
printing
office
because
he
had
made
a
bad
bargain
in
buying
its
editor
he
and
the
party
which
had
made
his
methods
its
own
by
nominating
him
were
held
up
to
the
most
unmerciful
ridicule
the
canvass
seemed
to
turn
on
the
indorsement
or
repudiation
of
my
had
then
become
familiar
to
the
people
of
the
state
and
the
large
man
who
instituted
a
mob
to
suppress
a
woman
of
my
size
and
then
failed
was
not
a
suitable
leader
for
american
men
even
if
they
were
democrats
the
of
democratic
rule
in
minnesota
was
rung
in
that
election
the
whole
republican
state
ticket
was
elected
with
gov
ramsey
at
its
head
and
he
was
the
first
governor
to
tender
troops
to
president
lincoln
for
the
suppression
of
the
rebellion
the
result
was
gratifying
although
our
own
county
stearns
was
overwhelmingly
democratic
and
must
remain
so
since
the
great
mass
of
the
people
were
catholics
however
the
election
of
the
state
ticket
was
largely
due
to
the
personal
popularity
of
gov
ramsey
and
this
could
not
be
depended
upon
for
a
lasting
arrangement
so
i
spent
the
winter
following
lecturing
through
the
state
sowing
seed
for
the
coming
presidential
campaign
i
never
spoke
in
public
during
an
election
excitement
never
advocated
on
the
platform
the
claims
of
any
particular
man
but
urged
general
principles
stephen
miller
was
our
st
cloud
delegate
to
the
chicago
convention
which
nominated
lincoln
led
the
canvass
in
the
state
as
the
most
efficient
speaker
and
was
chairman
of
the
electoral
college
his
prominent
position
in
the
border
ruffian
war
added
largely
to
his
popularity
in
the
state
and
once
more
that
little
printing
office
under
the
grand
old
trees
was
plunged
into
politics
this
time
into
an
election
on
which
hung
the
destinies
of
the
nation
how
that
election
was
carried
on
in
other
states
i
know
not
but
in
minnesota
the
banner
of
republicanism
and
human
freedom
was
borne
aloft
over
a
well
fought
field
there
was
not
much
surface
work
men
struggled
for
the
right
against
the
old
despotism
of
might
and
planted
their
cause
on
foundations
more
enduring
than
minnesota
granite
itself
yet
even
then
the
opposition
of
the
garrisonians
was
most
persistent
there
was
a
large
element
among
the
original
settlers
of
minnesota
but
it
was
mostly
of
the
garrisonian
or
type
and
had
lain
dormant
under
rule
to
utilize
this
element
at
the
polls
was
my
special
desire
the
ground
occupied
by
them
was
the
one
i
had
abandoned
the
ground
made
by
the
covenanters
when
the
constitution
first
appeared
they
pronounced
it
a
covenant
with
death
and
an
agreement
with
hell
and
would
not
vote
or
hold
office
under
it
would
not
take
an
oath
to
support
it
so
firmly
had
garrison
planted
himself
on
the
old
covenanter
platform
that
it
is
doubtful
whether
he
labored
harder
for
the
overthrow
of
slavery
or
political
whether
he
more
fiercely
denounced
or
men
who
voted
against
once
after
a
flaming
denunciation
of
political
abolitionists
some
one
said
to
him
garrison
i
am
surprised
at
the
ground
you
take
do
you
not
think
james
birney
and
gerrit
smith
are
he
hesitated
and
replied
they
have
tendencies
i
admit
now
james
birney
when
a
young
man
fell
heir
to
the
third
of
an
alabama
estate
and
arranged
with
the
other
heirs
to
take
the
slaves
as
his
portion
he
took
them
all
into
a
free
state
emancipated
them
and
left
himself
without
a
dollar
but
went
to
work
and
became
the
leader
of
political
abolitionists
while
gerrit
smith
devoted
his
splendid
talents
and
immense
wealth
to
the
cause
of
the
slave
when
their
mode
of
action
was
so
reprehensible
to
garrison
we
may
judge
the
strength
of
his
opposition
to
that
plan
of
action
which
resulted
in
the
overthrow
of
slavery
his
covered
ballots
as
well
as
bullets
and
slavery
the
creation
of
brute
force
and
ballots
must
not
be
attacked
by
any
weapon
save
moral
suasion
so
it
was
that
garrisonianism
off
the
line
of
the
underground
railroad
was
a
rather
harmless
foe
to
slavery
and
was
often
used
by
it
to
prevent
the
casting
of
votes
which
would
endanger
its
power
from
the
action
of
the
slave
power
it
must
by
that
time
have
been
apparent
to
all
that
adverse
votes
was
what
it
most
dreaded
but
covenanters
quakers
and
garrisonians
could
not
cast
these
without
soiling
their
hands
by
touching
that
bad
constitution
but
that
moral
which
thinks
first
of
its
own
hands
was
not
confined
to
abolitionists
for
the
thorough
goers
of
the
old
liberty
party
could
not
come
down
from
their
perch
on
platforms
which
embraced
all
the
moralities
to
work
on
one
which
only
said
to
slavery
not
another
foot
of
territory
both
these
parties
attacked
me
the
one
argued
that
i
of
necessity
endorsed
slavery
every
where
by
recognizing
the
constitution
the
other
that
i
must
favor
its
existence
where
it
then
was
by
working
with
the
republican
party
which
was
only
pledged
to
prevent
its
extension
to
me
these
positions
seemed
utterly
untenable
their
arguments
preposterous
and
i
did
my
best
to
make
this
appear
i
claimed
the
constitution
as
and
taught
the
duty
of
overthrowing
slavery
by
and
through
it
but
no
argument
which
i
used
did
half
the
service
of
an
illustration
which
came
to
me
i
had
a
little
garden
in
which
the
weeds
did
grow
and
little
bobbie
miller
had
a
little
broken
hoe
when
i
went
into
my
garden
to
cut
the
weeds
away
i
took
up
bobbie
little
hoe
to
help
me
in
the
fray
if
that
little
hoe
were
wanting
i
take
a
spoon
or
fork
or
any
other
implement
but
always
keep
at
work
if
any
one
would
send
me
a
broader
sharper
hoe
i
use
it
on
those
ugly
weeds
and
cut
more
with
one
blow
but
till
i
got
a
better
hoe
i
work
away
with
bobbie
i
ride
one
nag
and
not
a
dozen
hobbies
help
any
man
or
boy
or
fiend
to
do
what
needed
doing
and
only
stop
when
work
came
up
which
done
would
call
for
ruing
this
conceit
struck
popular
fancy
as
plain
argument
could
not
have
done
and
the
republican
party
came
to
be
called

imperfect

of
reaching

might

to

and
found
me
ill
with
quinsy
but
i
went
to
the
meeting
it
was
held
in
wilson
hall
which
was
on
the
second
floor
of
a
frame
building
and
was
so
packed
that
before
he
began
fears
were
felt
lest
the
floors
should
give
way
but
the
speaker
told
the
audience
that
the
floor
would
hold
still
if
they
did
and
any
one
who
felt
uneasy
had
better
leave
now
no
one
left
and
for
two
hours
and
a
half
he
held
that
packed
assembly
in
close
and
silent
attention
he
was
very
popular
on
the
frontier
on
account
of
his
homestead
bill
yet
the
hall
was
surrounded
all
the
time
he
spoke
by
a
howling
democratic
mob
who
hurled
stones
against
the
house
fired
guns
shouted
and
yelled
trying
to
drown
his
voice
to
make
it
more
interesting
and
try
to
draw
out
the
audience
they
made
a
huge
bonfire
and
burned
me
in
effigy
as
the
mother
of
the
republican
party
the
result
of
that
campaign
is
known
for

so
thoroughly

about
dancing
i
recommended
that
amusement
as
the
only
substitute
for
lascivious
plays
and
this
was
eagerly
seized
upon
by
those
who
saw
nothing
wrong
in
wholesale
concubinage
of
the
south
a
fierce
attack
was
made
on
by
a
zealous
baptist
minister
to
which
i
replied
when
it
was
announced
and
proclaimed
that
on
a
certain
sabbath
at
this
minister
would
answer
at
the
appointed
hour
the
house
overflowed
and
people
crowded
around
the
doors
and
windows
while
lowrie
occupied
a
prominent
seat
in
the
audience
it
surely
was
an
odd
sight
to
see
that
preacher
mount
the
stand
carrying
an
open
copy
of
lay
it
down
beside
the
bible
and
read
verse
about
from
the
two
documents
the
sermon
was
as
odd
as
the
text
it
disposed
of
me
by
the
summary
mode
of
denunciation
but
also
disposed
of
david
solomon
and
miriam
at
the
same
time
when
i
gave
the
discourse
a
careful
scriptural
criticism
i
carried
the
community
and
was
strengthened
by
the
controversy
but
another
more
serious
and
general
dispute
was
at
hand
when
theodore
parker
died
the
orthodox
press
from
maine
to
georgia
handed
him
over
to
satan
to
be
tormented
and
then
my
reputation
for
heresy
reached
its
rev
john
renwick
one
of
our
covenanter
martyrs
was
my
ideal
of
a
christian
and
when
he
lay
in
the
edinburg
prison
under
sentence
of
death
his
weeping
friends
begged
him
to
conform
and
save
his
life
they
said
to
him
dinna
ye
think
that
we
who
ha
conformit
may
be
saved
aye
aye
god
forbid
that
i
should
limit
his
grace
an
dinna
ye
think
ye
too
could
be
saved
and
conform
oh
aye
aye
the
blood
of
christ
cleanseth
fra
all
sin
weel
what
mair
do
ye
want
than
the
salvation
o
yer
saul
mair
mickle
mair
i
want
to
honor
my
master
and
bear
witness
to
the
truth
to
satisfy
this
want
he
died
a
felon
death
the
central
idea
of
that
old
westminster
theology
was
that
man
chief
end
is
to
glorify
god
first
and
enjoy
him
forever
when
that
is
done
in
all
the
religious
training
of
my
youth
i
had
never
heard
the
term
seek
salvation
we
were
to
seek
the
privilege
of
serving
god
yet
i
was
willing
to
be
into
heaven
with
the
rest
of
the
presbyterians
a
protestant
episcopal
convention
had
pointedly
refused
to
advise
members
of
that
church
to
respect
the
marriage
relation
among
their
slaves
and
so
had
dimmed
the
elizabethian
glory
of
a
church
which
once
stood
for
freedom
so
nobly
that
the
winds
and
waves
became
her
allies
and
crowned
her
with
victory
the
general
assembly
had
laid
the
honor
of
its
martyrs
in
the
dust
by
endorsing
human
slavery
and
i
must
be
false
to
every
conviction
if
i
did
not
protest
against
calling
that
christianity
which
held
out
crowns
of
glory
to
and
their
abettors
and
everlasting
torments
to
those
who
had
spent
their
lives
glorifying
god
and
bearing
witness
to
the
truth
my
defense
of
parker
and
unwillingness
to
have
all
unitarians
sent
to
the
other
side
of
the
great
gulf
won
for
me
a
prominent
place
among
those
whom
the
churches
pronounced
infidels
but
there
came
a
time
when
providence
seemed
to
be
on
the
side
of
the
slave
rev
calhoun
was
a
gentleman
a
presbyterian
clergyman
and
one
of
those
urbane
men
who
add
force
and
dignity
to
any
opinion
his
wife
was
lowrie
only
sister
he
preached
gratuitously
in
st
cloud
and
border
ruffianism
and
slavery
gained
respectability
through
their
connection
when
he
and
his
wife
made
that
fatal
plunge
off
the
bridge
in
st
cloud
a
plunge
which
sent
a
thrill
of
horror
through
the
land
i
accompanied
my
sympathetic
respectful
obituary
notice
with
the
statement
that
the
costly
cutter
wrecked
and
the
valuable
horse
instantly
killed
were
both
purchased
with
money
obtained
by
the
sale
of
a
woman
and
her
child
who
had
been
held
as
slaves
in
minnesota
in
defiance
of
her
law
and
been
taken
by
this
popular
divine
to
a
tennessee
auction
block
the
accident
was
entirely
owing
to
the
unprecedented
and
unaccountable
behavior
of
that
horse
and
people
shuddered
with
a
new
horror
on
being
reminded
of
the
price
which
had
been
paid
for
him
bodies
and
souls
of
two
citizens
and
the
honor
of
that
free
state
chapter
xliii
frontier
life
the
culture
which
the
pale
faces
introduced
into
that
land
of
the
dakotas
was
sometimes
curious
the
first
sermon
i
heard
there
was
preached
in
rockville
a
on
the
sauk
twelve
miles
from
its
confluence
with
the
mississippi
in
a
of
which
the
roof
was
not
yet
shingled
the
only
table
in
the
town
served
as
a
pulpit
the
red
blankets
from
one
wagon
were
converted
into
cushions
for
the
front
pews
which
consisted
of
rough
boards
laid
on
trussles
there
was
only
one
hymn
book
and
after
reading
the
hymn
the
preacher
tendered
the
book
to
any
one
who
would
lead
the
singing
but
no
one
volunteered
my
scruples
about
psalms
seemed
to
vanish
so
i
went
forward
took
the
book
lined
out
the
hymn
and
started
a
tune
which
was
readily
taken
up
and
sung
by
all
present
we
were
well
satisfied
with
what
the
day
brought
us
as
we
rode
home
past
those
wonderful
granite
rocks
which
spring
up
out
of
the
prairie
looking
like
old
in
a
meadow
there
were
people
in
our
frontier
town
who
would
have
graced
any
society
and
with
the
elasticity
of
true
culture
adapted
themselves
to
all
circumstances
at
my
residence
which
adjoined
the
office
i
held
fortnightly
receptions
at
which
dancing
was
the
amusement
and
coffee
and
sandwiches
the
refreshments
at
one
of
these
i
had
the
honor
to
entertain
gov
ramsey
donnelly
state
treas
shaeffer
and
a
large
delegation
from
paul
but
not
having
plates
for
seventy
people
i
substituted
squares
of
white
printing
paper
when
gov
ramsey
received
his
he
turned
it
over
and
said
what
am
i
to
do
with
this
that
is
the
ticket
you
are
to
vote
was
the
answer
in
our
social
life
there
was
often
a
weird
mingling
of
civilization
and
barbarism
upon
one
occasion
a
concert
was
given
in
which
the
audience
were
in
full
dress
and
all
evening
in
the
principal
streets
of
st
cloud
a
lot
of
chippewas
played
with
the
heads
of
some
sioux
with
whom
they
had
been
at
war
that
day
in
those
days
brains
and
culture
were
found
in
shanties
the
leaders
of
progress
did
not
shrink
from
association
with
the
rude
forces
of
savages
and
mother
nature
st
cloud
was
the
advance
post
of
that
march
of
civilization
by
which
the
northern
pacific
railroad
has
since
sought
to
reach
the
sascatchewan
a
territory
yet
to
be
made
into
five
states
as
large
as
illinois
all
the
hudson
bay
goods
from
europe
passed
our
doors
in
wagons
or
on
sleds
under
the
care
of
the
burbanks
the
great
mail
carriers
and
express
men
of
minnesota
and
once
they
brought
a
young
lady
who
had
come
by
express
from
glasgow
scotland
and
been
placed
under
the
charge
of
their
agent
at
new
york
and
whom
they
handed
over
to
the
officer
she
had
come
to
marry
on
the
shores
of
hudson
bay
but
their
teams
usually
came
east
with
little
freight
as
the
furs
sent
to
europe
came
down
in
carts
not
one
of
which
had
so
much
iron
as
a
nail
in
them
and
which
came
in
long
creaking
trains
drawn
by
oxen
or
indian
ponies
in
each
train
there
was
generally
one
gorgeous
equipage
a
cart
painted
blue
with
a
canvas
cover
drawn
by
one
large
white
ox
in
harness
in
this
coach
of
state
rode
the
lady
of
the
train
who
was
generally
a
on
her
way
to
do
her
shopping
in
paul
once
the
lady
was
a
indian
and
had
her
baby
with
her
neatly
dressed
and
strapped
to
a
board
a
bandage
across
the
forehead
held
the
head
in
place
and
every
portion
of
the
body
was
as
secure
as
board
and
bandages
could
make
them
except
the
arms
from
the
elbow
down
but
no
danger
of
the
little
fellow
sucking
his
thumb
his
lady
mamma
did
not
have
to
hold
him
for
he
was
stood
up
in
a
corner
like
a
cane
or
umbrella
and
seemed
quite
comfortable
as
well
as
content
she
had
traveled
seven
weeks
had
come
seventeen
hundred
miles
to
purchase
some
dresses
and
trinkets
and
would
no
doubt
be
a
profitable
customer
to
paul
merchants
for
the
lady
of
the
train
was
a
person
of
wealth
and
authority
always
the
wife
of
the
and
her
sentence
of
death
might
have
been
fatal
to
any
man
in
it
in
these
trains
were
always
found
indians
filling
positions
as
useful
laborers
for
the
english
government
never
gave
premiums
for
idleness
and
vagabondism
among
indians
by
feeding
and
clothing
them
without
effort
on
their
own
part
their
dexterity
in
turning
griddle
cakes
by
shaking
the
pan
and
giving
it
a
jerk
which
sent
the
cake
up
into
the
air
and
brought
it
down
square
into
the
pan

have

the
first
steamboat
which
ran
above
the
falls
of
anthony
and
in
the
spring
of
she
was
steamed
and
hawsered
up
the
sauk
rapids
and
ran
two
hundred
miles
until
the
falls
of
pokegamy
offered
insurmountable
barriers
to
further
progress
it
was
thought
impossible
to
get
her
down
again
there
was
no
business
for
her
and
she
lay
useless
until
the
next
winter
anson
northup
took
out
her
machinery
and
drew
it
across
on
sleds
to
the
red
river
of
the
north
where
it
was
built
into
the
first
steamboat
which
ever
ran
on
that
river
before
starting
on
his
expedition
northup
came
to
the
office
to
leave
an
advertisement
and
ask
me
to
appeal
to
the
public
for
aid
in
provisions
and
feed
to
be
furnished
along
the
route
he
was
in
a
buffalo
suit
from
his
ears
to
his
feet
and
looked
like
a
bale
of
furs
on
his
head
he
wore
a
fox
skin
cap
with
the
nose
lying
on
the
two
paws
of
the
animal
just
between
his
eyes
the
tail
hanging
down
between
his
shoulders
he
was
a
brave
strong
man
and
carried
out
his
project
which
to
most
people
was
wild
nothing
seemed
more
important
than
the
cultivation
of
health
for
the
people
and
to
this
i
gave
much
earnest
attention
often
expressed
in
the
form
of
badinage
there
were
so
many
young
housekeepers
that
there
was
much
need
of
teachers
i
tried
to
get
the
new
england
women
to
stop
feeding
their
families
on
dough
especially
hot
soda
dough
and
to
substitute
bread
as
a
steady
article
of
diet
in
trying
to
wean
them
from
cake
i
told
of
a
time
when
chaos
reigned
on
earth
long
before
the
days
of
the
mastodons
but
even
then
new
england
women
were
up
making
cake
and
would
certainly
be
found
at
that
business
when
the
last
trump
sounded
but
they
bore
with
my
crotchets
very
patiently
and
even
seemed
to
enjoy
them
chapter
xliv
printers
the
printer
case
used
to
be
one
of
the
highways
to
editorial
and
congressional
honors
but
the
little
fellows
of
the
craft
invented
a
machine
which
goes
over
it
like
a
header
over
a
and
leaves
a
dead
level
of
stalks
all
minus
the
heads
so
that
no
tall
fellows
are
left
to
shame
them
by
passing
on
from
the
stick
to
the
tripod
or

their
great
union
flattens
them
all
out
like
and
tramps
are
not
overshadowed
by
the
superiority
of
industrious
men
but
the
leveling
process
makes
impassable
mountains
and
gorges
in
other
walks
of
life
makes
it
necessary
that
a
publisher
with
one
hundred
readers
must
pay
as
much
for
as
he
with
a
hundred
thousand
the
salary
of
editors
and
contributors
may
vary
from
nothing
to
ten
thousand
a
year
but
through
all
mutations
of
this
life
the
printer
wages
must
remain
in
so
the
union
kills
small
papers
prevents
competition
in
the
newspaper
business
builds
up
monster
establishments
and
keeps
typos
at
the
case
forever
and
a
day
i
knew
when
the
started
that
it
could
not
live
and
pay
for
the
same
price
as
paid
by
the
new
york
and
the
day
the
office
became
mine
i
stated
that
fact
to
the
printers
who
took
their
hats
and
left
in
i
had
spent
some
part
of
every
day
for
two
weeks
in
a
composing
room
and
with
the
knowledge
then
acquired
i
in
started
the
business
of
practical
printer
i
took
a
proof
of
my
first
stick
and
lo
it
read
from
right
to
left
i
distributed
that
but
had
to
mark
the
stick
that
i
might
remember
the
first
day
i
took
two
boys
as
apprentices
first
wesley
miller
who
had
spent
two
months
in
a
harrisburg
office
and
knew
something
of
the
art
but
did
not
like
anything
about
it
except
working
the
press
second
my
nephew
william
mitchell
who
was
thirteen
knew
nothing
of
types
but
was
a
model
of
patient
industry
our
magnanimous
printers
hung
around
hotels
laughing
at
the
absurdity
of
this
amateur
office
we
might
set
type
but
when
it
came
to
making
and
locking
up
a
form
ha
ha
would
there
be
sport
that
handsome
new
type
would
all
be
a
mess
of
pi
then
somebody
would
be
obliged
to
come
to
their
terms
or
st
cloud
would
be
without
a
paper
it
was
their
great
opportunity
to
display
their
interest
in
the
general
welfare
and
they
embraced
it
to
the
full
but
of
the
little
i
had
learned
in
that
short
apprenticeship
six
years
ago
i
retained
a
clear
conception
of
the
principles
of
justification
by
works
i
brought
these
to
bear
on
those
forms
made
them
up
locked
them
and
sent
for
stephen
miller
to
carry
them
to
the
press
when
each
one
lifted
like
a
paving
stone
but
alas
alas
the
columns
read
from
right
to
left
i
unlocked
them
put
the
matter
back
in
the
galleys
made
them
up
new
and
we
had
the
paper
off
on
time
from
that
time
until
the
first
of
january
i
carried
on

the
rebellion
when
after
lincoln
election
the
south
made
the
north
understand
that
her
threats
of
disunion
meant
something
more
than
tin
kettle
thunder
there
was
little
spirit
of
compromise
among
the
republicans
and
douglas
democrats
of
minnesota
who
generally
looked
with
impatience
on
the
abject
servility
with
which
northern
men
in
congress
begged
their
southern
masters
not
to
leave
them
with
no
slaves
to
catch
no
peculiar
institution
to
guard
i
was
in
favor
of
not
only
permitting
the
southern
states
to
leave
the
union
but
of
driving
them
out
of
it
as
we
would
drive
tramps
out
of
a
drawing
room
them
out
and
open
every
avenue
for
the
escape
of
their
slaves
but
from
that
spirit
of
conciliation
with
which
the
north
first
met
secession
the
change
was
sudden
the
fire
on
sumter
lit
an
actual
flame
of
freedom
and
the
people
were
ready
then
to
wipe
slavery
from
the
whole
face
of
the
land
when
fremont
issued
his
famous
order
confiscating
the
slaves
of
rebels
in
arms
i
was
in
receipt
of
a
large
exchange
list
and
have
never
seen
such
unanimity
on
any
subject
i
think
there
were
but
two
papers
which
offered
an
objection
but
this
land
was
not
worthy
to
do
a
generous
deed
so
president
lincoln
rescinded
that
order
and
the
great
rushing
stream
of
popular
enthusiasm
was
dammed
turned
back
to
flow
into
the
dismal
swamp
of
constitutional
quibbles
and
statutory
inventions
there
it
lay
and
bred
reptiles
and
miasmas
to
sting
and
poison
the
guilty
inhabitants
of
this
great
land
and
never
since
have
we
been
permitted
to
reach
an
enthusiasm
in
favor
of
any
great
principle
for
history
has
no
record
of
a
great
act
so
thoroughly
divested
of
all
greatness
by
the
meanness
of
the
motive
as
is
our
act
of
emancipation
long
after
the
war
was
in
progress
the
old
habit
of
yielding
precedence
to
the
south
manifested
itself
so
strongly
as
to
sour
and
disgust
the
staunchest
republicans
the
only
two
important
military
appointments
given
by
lincoln
administration
to
st
cloud
were
given
to
two
southern
democrats
officeholders
under
buchanan
and
supporters
of
breckinridge
the
southern
candidate
for
president
in
in
the
autumn
of
i
asked
a
farmer
to
take
out
and
post
bills
for
a
meeting
to
send
delegates
to
the
county
convention
he
had
been
an
active
worker
in
the
campaign
of
had
never
sought
an
office
and
i
was
surprised
when
he
declined
so
small
a
service
but
his
explanation
was
this
if
the
democrats
win
the
election
the
democrats
will
get
the
offices
if
the
republicans
win
the
election
the
democrats
will
get
the
offices
and
i
do
see
but
we
may
as
well
let
them
win
the
election
when
i
explained
that
the
more
false
others
were
to
a
party
or
principle
the
more
need
there
was
for
him
to
be
true
he
took
the
bills
and
managed
the
meeting
but
running
a
republican
ticket
under
a
republican
administration
was
not
so
easy
as
running
the
same
ticket
under
buchanan
then
men
had
hope
and
enthusiasm
but
this
was
killed
by
a
victory
through
which
the
enemy
was
made
to
triumph
as
gov
ramsey
was
the
first
to
tender
troops
to
president
lincoln
for
the
suppression
of
the
rebellion
so
the
men
of
minnesota
were
among
the
first
to
organize
and
drill
stephen
miller
raised
a
company
in
st
cloud
with
it
joined
the
first
regiment
at
snelling
and
was
appointed
lieut
we
went
to
snelling
to
see
our
first
regiment
embark
it
was
a
grand
sight
to
see
the
men
in
red
shirts
and
white
havelocks
march
down
that
rocky
winding
way
going
to
their
southern
graves
for
very
few
of
them
ever
returned
more
troops
were
called
for
and
two
companies
formed
in
st
cloud
while
they
waited
under
marching
orders
they
and
the
citizens
were
aroused
at
two
one
morning
by
the
cry
from
the
east
side
of
the
river
of
indians
indians
a
boat
was
sent
over
and
brought
a
messenger
with
the
news
of
the
sioux
massacre
at
ridgley
chapter
xlvi
platforms
my
first
public
speech
was
the
revelation
of
a
talent
hidden
in
a
napkin
and
i
set
about
putting
it
to
usury
i
wrote
a
lecture
women
and
politics
as
a
reason
for
my
anomalous
position
and
a
justification
of
those
men
who
had
endorsed
my
right
to
be
a
political
leader
and
gave
sketches
of
women
in
sacred
and
profane
history
who
had
been
so
endorsed
by
brave
and
wise
men
the
lecture
gave
an
account
of
the
wrongs
heaped
upon
women
by
slavery
as
a
reason
why
women
were
then
called
upon
for
special
activity
and
i
never
failed
to
bring
down
the
house
by
describing
the
scene
in
which
the
tall
kentuckian
proposed
to
the
tall
pennsylvanian
that
he
should
horsewhip
an
old
woman
one
hundred
and
two
times
to
compel
her
to
earn
two
hundred
dollars
with
which
his
mightiness
might
purchase
havana
cigars
gold
chains
or
to
elicit
signs
of
shame
by
relating
the
fact
of
the
united
states
government
proposing
to
withdraw
diplomatic
relations
with
austria
for
whipping
hungarian
women
for
political
offenses
while
was
the
principal
industry
of
our
american
chivalry
i
stated
that
men
had
sought
to
divide
this
world
into
two
fields
religion
and
politics
in
the
first
they
were
content
that
their
mothers
and
wives
should
dwell
with
them
but
in
the
second
no
kid
slipper
was
ever
to
be
set
horace
mann
had
warned
women
to
stand
back
saying
politics
is
a
stygian
pool
i
insisted
that
politics
had
reached
this
condition
through
the
permit
given
to
satan
to
turn
all
the
waste
water
of
his
mills
into
that
pool
that
this
grant
must
be
rescinded
and
the
pool
drained
at
all
hazards
indeed
the
emergency
was
such
that
even
women
might
handle
shovels
chicago
had
once
been
in
a
swamp
but
the
city
fathers
had
lifted
it
six
feet
politicians
must
raise
the
grade
must
lift
their
politics
the
height
of
a
man
and
make
them
a
habitation
for
men
not
reptiles
at
this
an
audience
would
burst
into
uproarous
applause
as
for
the
grand
division
no
surveyor
could
find
the
line
for
no
line
was
possible
between
religion
and
politics
the
attempt
to
divide
them
is
an
assumption
that
there
is
some
part
of
the
universe
in
which
the
lord
is
not
the
fathers
of
the
republic
had
explored
and
found
a
country
they
thought
was
outside
the
divine
jurisdiction
and
called
it
politics
because
old
world
government
had
bowed
to
popes
and
prelates
they
would
ignore
deity
and
say
to
omnipotence
what
canute
did
to
the
sea
thus
far
shalt
thou
go
but
no
further
and
here
shall
thy
proud
waves
be
stayed
but
god
laughed
them
to
scorn
and
would
certainly
dash
them
to
pieces
the
government
which
they
had
set
up
like
the
golden
image
of
nebuchadnezzer
and
demanded
that
all
should
bow
before
it
this
same
government
was
bound
to
sustain
men
in
scourging
women
for
chastity
every
man
who
voted
a
democratic
ticket
voted
to
put
down
as
insurrection
any
attempt
to
stand
between
the
cradle
and
its
robber
i
never
spoke
of
the
st
cloud
trouble
there
was
too
much
else
to
talk
about
i
was
seldom
interrupted
by
anything
but
applause
but
in
stillwater
i
was
hissed
for
denouncing
buchanan
administration
i
waited
a
moment
then
lowered
my
voice
and
said
i
had
raised
a
good
many
goslings
and
thought
i
had
left
them
all
in
pennsylvania
but
found
some
had
followed
me
and
was
sorry
to
have
no
corn
for
them
there
was
no
further
interruption
i
was
at
that
time
the
guest
of
a
son
of
my
pittsburg
friend
judge
mcmillan
who
led
the
singing
in
our
church
and
with
whom
i
expect
to
sing
thomas
in
heaven
my
host
of
that
evening
afterwards
became
senator
from
minnesota
a
considerable
portion
of
three
winters
i
traveled
in
minnesota
and
lectured
one
day
riding
thirty
miles
in
an
open
cutter
when
the
mercury
was
frozen
and
the
wind
blew
almost
a
gale
have
crossed
houseless
prairies
between
midnight
and
morning
with
only
a
stage
driver
and
i
never
encountered
a
neglect
or
a
rudeness
but
found
gentlemen
in
red
flannel
shirts
and
their
trowsers
stuffed
into
the
tops
of
their
boots
who
had
no
knowledge
of
grammar
and
who
would
i
think
have
sold
their
lives
dearly
in
my
defense
late
in
or
early
in
i
lectured
in
mantorville
and
was
the
guest
of
bancroft
editor
of
the
when
he
handed
me
a
copy
of
the
new
york
pointed
to
an
item
and
turned
away
it
was
a
four
line
announcement
that
he
who
had
been
my
husband
had
obtained
a
divorce
on
the
ground
of
desertion
i
laid
down
the
paper
looked
at
my
hands
and
thought
once
more
you
are
mine
true
the
proceeds
of
your
twenty
years
of
are
back
there
in
egypt
with
your
lost
patrimony
but
we
are
over
the
red
sea
out
in
the
free
desert
no
pursuit
is
possible
and
if
bread
fails
god
will
send
manna
while
i
sat
bancroft
came
to
me
caressed
me
and
said
old
things
have
passed
away
and
all
things
have
become
new
chapter
xlvii
out
into
the
world
and
home
again
in
my
first
lecturing
winter
i
spoke
in
the
hall
of
representatives
paul
to
a
large
audience
and
succeeded
past
all
my
hopes
i
spoke
there
again
in
the
winter
of
and
on
the
question
and
in
a
public
hall
on
woman
legal
disabilities
both
were
very
successful
and
i
was
invited
to
give
the
latter
lecture
before
the
senate
which
i
did
the
hall
was
packed
and
the
lecture
received
with
profound
attention
interrupted
by
hearty
applause
the
senate
was
in
session
and
lowrie
occupied
his
seat
as
a
member
it
was
a
great
fall
for
him
to
tumble
from
his
dictatorship
to
so
small
an
honor
he
sat
and
looked
at
me
like
one
in
a
dream
and
i
could
not
but
see
that
he
was
breaking
i
hoped
he
would
come
up
with
others
when
they
began
to
crowd
around
me
but
he
did
not
i
had
come
to
be
the
of
all
lookers
the
of
all
talkers
was
the
guest
of
geo
a
nurse
the
attorney
dined
with
the
governor
and
was
praised
by
the
press
i
was
dubbed
the
fanny
kemble
of
america
and
reminded
critics
of
the
then
greatest
shylock
of
the
stage
a
judge
from
ohio
said
there
was
not
a
man
in
the
state
who
could
have
presented
that
case
woman
legal
disabilities
so
well
indeed
i
was
almost
as
popular
as
if
i
were
about
to
be
hanged
a
responsible
eastern
offered
me
one
hundred
dollars
each
for
three
lectures
one
in
milwaukee
one
in
chicago
and
one
in
cleveland
i
wanted
to
accept
but
was
overruled
by
friends
who
thought
me
too
feeble
to
travel
alone
and
that
i
would
make
more
by
employing
an
agent
they
selected
a
pious
gentleman
whose
name
i
have
forgotten
and
we
left
paul
at
four
one
winter
morning
in
a
prairie
schooner
on
to
ride
to
la
crosse
one
of
the
passengers
was
a
pompous
southerner
who
kept
boasting
of
the
buck
niggers
he
had
sold
and
the
niggers
he
had
caught
and
his
delight
in
that
sort
of
work
his
talk
was
aimed
at
me
but
he
did
not
address
me
and
for
hours
i
took
no
notice
then
after
an
unusual
explosion
i
said
quietly
can
you
remember
sir
just
exactly
how
many
niggers
you
have
killed
and
eaten
in
your
day
he
looked
out
on
the
river
and
seemed
to
begin
a
calculation
but
must
have
found
the
lists
of
his
exploits
too
long
for
utterance
for
he
had
spoken
not
another
word
when
we
reached
la
crosse
where
we
took
cars
for
madison
wisconsin
we
reached
that
beautiful
city
of
lakes
in
time
to
meet
news
of
the
donelson
fatal
victory
that
victory
made
so
much
worse
than
a
hundred
defeats
by
the
return
to
their
masters
of
the
slaves
who
remained
in
the
fort
and
claimed
the
protection
of
our
flag
the
victory
which
converted
the
great
loyal
army
of
the
north
into
a
gang
of
alas
my
native
land
all
hope
for
the
preservation
of
the
government
died
out
in
my
heart
what
could
a
just
god
want
with
such
a
people
what
could
he
do
but
destroy
them
that
victory
was
celebrated
in
madison
with
appropriate
ceremonies
men
got
drunk
and
cursed
niggers
and
abolitionists
sat
up
all
night
in
noisy
orgies
drinking
health
and
success
to
him
who
was
the
synonym
of
american
glory
the
excitement
and
sudden
revulsion
against
abolitionists
with
the
total
incompetence
of
my
agent
caused
a
financial
failure
of
my
lecture
but
i
made
pleasant
friendships
with
gov
harvey
carr
and
their
wives
i
started
along
the
route
we
had
come
and
everywhere
in
cars
hotels
men
were
hurrahing
for
grant
and
cursing
niggers
and
abolitionists
the
hero
had
healed
the
breach
between
the
loving
brothers
of
the
north
and
south
who
were
to
rush
into
each
others
arms
across
the
prostrate
form
of
liberty
thank
god
for
the
madness
of
the
south
for
that
sublime
universal
government
which
maketh
the
wrath
of
man
to
praise
him
even
in
that
hour
of
triumph
for
despotism
i
did
not
doubt
but
freedom
would
march
on
until
no
slave
contaminated
the
earth
but
before
that
march
this
degraded
government
must
share
the
fate
of
that
other
babylon
which
once
dealt
in
slaves
and
souls
of
men
my
first
small
town
lecture
was
another
financial
failure
and
in
the
hall
i
paid
and
dismissed
that
highly
respectable
incubus
my
agent
that
night
i
slept
in
a
hotel
and
going
to
a
bed
which
had
not
been
properly
ventilated
wondered
if
it
could
be
my
duty
to
breast
that
storm
of
popular
frenzy
could
i
at
any
time
be
required
to
drink
tea
out
of
a
coarse
delf
cup
and
sleep
in
such
a
bed
luxuries
i
wanted
none
but
a
china
cup
silver
spoon
and
soft
blankets
were
necessaries
of
life
as
i
lay
uncertain
always
whether
i
slept
i
seemed
to
sit
on
a
projecting
rock
on
the
side
of
a
precipice
draped
with
poisonous
vines
there
was
no
spot
on
which
i
could
place
my
feet
while
out
of
holes
snakes
hissed
at
me
and
on
ledges
panthers
glared
at
me
with
their
green
fiery
eyes
and
the
tips
of
their
tails
wagging
far
below
lay
a
lovely
green
valley
walled
on
both
sides
by
these
haunted
precipitous
banks
but
stretching
up
and
down
until
lost
in
vista
i
knew
that
to
the
right
was
north
the
direction
of
home
and
to
the
left
south
the
way
out
into
the
great
unknown
if
i
could
only
reach
that
lovely
valley
and
the
clear
stream
which
ran
through
it
but
this
was
a
vain
longing
until
there
appeared
in
it
a
young
man
in
a
grey
suit
and
soft
black
felt
hat
he
came
up
the
precipice
toward
me
and
a
way
made
itself
before
him
until
he
held
up
his
hand
and
said
come
down
i
saw
his
face
and
knew
it
was
christ
after
seeing
that
face
all
the
conceptions
of
all
the
artists
are
an
offense
moreover
the
christ
of
in
the
person
of
his
follower
has
often
come
to
me
in
the
garb
of
a
working
man
but
never
in
priestly
robes
he
led
me
down
the
precipice
without
a
word
pointed
northward
and
said
walk
in
the
valley
and
you
will
be
safe
he
was
gone
and
i
became
conscious
that
i
had
been
seeking
popularity
money
and
these
were
not
for
me
i
must
go
home
but
first
i
would
try
to
repair
the
loss
incurred
by
that
agent
i
lectured
in
a
small
town
a
nucleus
of
a
seven
day
baptist
settlement
and
was
the
guest
of
the
proprietor
who
had
built
a
great
many
concrete
walls
coming
out
into
a
heavy
wind
i
took
acute
inflammation
of
the
lungs
my
hostess
gave
me
every
attention
but
i
must
go
home
for
my
symptoms
were
alarming
so
took
the
train
the
next
morning
with
my
chest
in
wet
compresses
a
viol
of
aconite
in
my
pocket
and
was
better
when
by
rail
and
schooner
i
reached
the
house
of
the
good
samaritan
judge
wilson
of
winona
here
i
was
made
whole
lectured
in
winona
and
other
towns
and
got
back
to
paul
with
more
money
than
when
i
left
i
started
for
home
one
morning
in
a
schooner
at
one
the
next
morning
our
craft
settled
down
and
refused
to
go
farther
the
snow
was
three
feet
deep
it
had
been
raining
steadily
for
twelve
hours
and
when
the
men
got
out
to
pry
out
the
runners
they
went
down
down
far
over
their
knees
the
driver
and
express
agent
were
booted
for
such
occasions
but
the
two
germans
were
not
myself
these
four
and
no
more
were
down
in
the
book
of
fate
for
a
struggle
with
inertia
it
was
muscle
and
mind
against
matter
to
the
muscle
i
contributed
nothing
but
might
add
something
to
the
common
stock
of
mind
the
agent
and
driver
concluded
that
he
should
take
a
horse
and
go
to
the
nearest
house
two
miles
back
to
get
shovels
to
dig
us
out
i
asked
if
there
were
fresh
horses
and
men
at
the
house
no
how
far
is
it
to
st
cloud
six
miles
are
there
fresh
horses
and
men
there
oh
plenty
if
you
dig
us
out
here
how
long
will
it
be
before
we
go
in
again
this
they
did
not
know
then
had
not
the
driver
better
go
to
st
cloud
with
both
horses
the
horse
left
here
would
be
ruined
standing
in
that
slush
but
madam
said
the
agent
if
we
do
that
we
will
have
to
leave
you
here
all
night
well
i
said
i
do
not
see
how
you
are
going
to
get
rid
of
me
so
the
driver
started
with
the
two
horses
on
that
dreadful
journey
had
i
known
how
dreadful
i
should
have
tried
to
keep
him
till
morning
as
he
left
i
made
the
germans
draw
off
their
boots
and
pour
out
the
water
rub
their
chilled
feet
and
roll
them
up
in
a
buffalo
robe
the
agent
lay
on
his
box
i
cuddled
in
a
corner
and
we
all
went
to
sleep
to
the
music
of
the
patter
of
the
soft
rain
on
our
canvas
cover
at
sunrise
we
were
waked
by
a
little
army
of
men
and
horses
and
another
schooner
into
which
we
passed
by
bridge
we
reached
st
cloud
in
time
for
breakfast
and
were
greeted
by
the
news
that
general
lowrie
had
been
sent
home
insane
he
was
confined
in
his
own
house
and
his
much
envied
young
wife
with
her
two
babies
had
become
an
object
of
pity
chapter
xlviii
the
aristocracy
of
the
west
before
going
to
minnesota
i
had
the
common
cooper
idea
of
the
dignity
and
glory
of
the
noble
red
man
of
the
forest
and
was
especially
impressed
by
his
unexampled
faithfulness
to
those
who
had
ever
been
so
fortunate
as
to
eat
salt
with
him
in
planning
my
hermitage
i
had
pictured
the
most
amicable
relations
with
those
unsophisticated
children
of
nature
who
should
never
want
for
salt
while
there
was
a
spoonful
in
my
barrel
i
should
win
them
to
friendships
as
i
had
done
railroad
laborers
by
caring
for
their
sick
children
and
aiding
their
wives
indeed
i
think
the
indians
formed
a
large
part
of
the
attractions
of
my
cabin
by
the
lakes
and
it
required
considerable
time
and
experience
to
bring
me
to
any
true
knowledge
of
the
situation
which
was
and
is
this
between
the
indian
and
white
settler
rages
the
war
of
hereditary
against
those
who
beg
their
brother
man
for
leave
to
live
and
toil
william
penn
disclaimed
the
right
of
conquest
as
a
land
title
while
he
himself
held
an
english
estate
based
on
that
title
and
while
every
acre
of
land
on
the
globe
was
held
by
it
he
could
not
recognize
that
title
in
english
hands
but
did
in
the
hands
of
indians
and
while
pretending
to
purchase
of
them
a
conquest
title
perpetrated
one
of
the
greatest
swindles
on
record
since
that
by
which
jacob
won
the
birthright
of
his
starving
brother
this
penn
swindle
has
been
so
carefully
cloaked
that
it
has
become
the
basis
of
our
whole
indian
policy
the
legitimate
parent
of
a
system
never
equalled
on
earth
for
crime
committed
with
the
best
intentions
it
intends
to
be
especially
just
by
holding
that
the
creator
made
north
america
for
the
exclusive
use
of
savages
and
that
civilization
can
only
exist
here
by
sufferance
of
the
proprietors
this
sufferance
it
tries
to
purchase
by
engaging
to
support
these
proprietors
in
absolute
idleness
from
the
proceeds
of
the
toil
they
license
even
as
kings
and
other
landed
aristocrats
are
supported
by
the
labor
of
their
subjects
and
tenants
as
the
successors
of
the
of
tarsus
have
for
thirteen
centuries
been
found
on
the
side
of
aristocrats
in
every
contest
with
plebians
so
the
piety
of
the
east
controlled
by
men
who
live
without
labor
was
and
is
on
the
side
of
the
royal
red
man
who
has
a
most
royal
contempt
for
plows
hoes
and
all
other
degrading
implements
the
same
community
of
interests
which
arrayed
the
mass
of
the
clergy
on
the
side
of
southern
slaveholders
arrayed
that
same
clergy
on
the
side
of
the
western
slave
holder
and
against
the
men
who
seek
with
plows
and
hoes
to
get
a
living
out
of
the
ground
under
this
arrangement
we
have
the
spectacle
of
a
christian
people
arrayed
in
open
hostility
to
those
who
plant
christian
churches
schools
and
libraries
on
the
lair
of
the
wolf
and
in
alliance
with
the
savage
who
coolly
unjoints
the
feet
and
hands
of
little
children
puts
them
in
his
hunting
pouch
as
evidence
of
his
valor
and
leaves
the
victim
to
die
at
leisure
of
those
who
thrust
christian
babies
into
ovens
and
deliberately
roast
them
to
death
of
those
who
bind
infants
two
by
two
by
one
wrist
and
throw
them
across
a
fence
to
die
of
those
who
collect
little
children
in
groups
and
lock
them
up
in
a
room
to
wail
out
their
little
lives
of
those
who
commit
outrages
on
innocent
men
and
women
who
the
pen
must
forever
refuse
to
record
the
apology
with
which
piety
converts
the
crimes
of
its
pets
into
virtues
is
that
its
own
agents
have
failed
to
carry
out
its
own
contract
with
its
own
friends
the
men
and
women
who
take
their
lives
in
their
hands
to
lead
the
westward
march
of
civilization
are
held
as
foes
by
the
main
body
of
the
army
who
conspire
with
the
enemy
and
hand
them
over
as
scapegoats
whose
tortures
and
death
are
to
appease
divine
wrath
for
the
crimes
which
this
same
main
body
say
it
has
itself
committed
against
indians
no
one
pretends
that
western
settlers
have
injured
indians
but
eastern
philanthropists
through
the
government
they
control
have
according
to
their
own
showing
been
guilty
of
no
end
of
frauds
and
as
they
do
not
and
can
not
stop
the
stealing
they
pay
their
debts
to
the
noble
red
man
by
licensing
him
to
outrage
women
torture
infants
and
burn
homes
when
gold
is
scarce
in
the
east
they
substitute
scalps
and
furnish
indians
with
by
the
thousand
that
they
may
collect
their
dues
at
their
own
convenience
this
may
seem
a
bitter
partisan
accusation
but
it
must
be
the
calm
verdict
of
history
when
this
comes
to
be
written
by
impartial
pens
under
the
pretense
that
america
belonged
in
fee
simple
and
by
special
divine
right
to
that
particular
hoard
of
savages
who
by
killing
off
some
other
hoard
of
savages
were
in
possession
when
columbus
first
saw
the
great
west
the
eastern
states
which
had
already
secured
their
land
by
conquest
have
become
more
implacable
foes
to
civilization
than
the
savages
themselves
the
quaker
would
form
no
alliance
with
southern
he
recoiled
from
the
sale
of
women
and
children
in
south
carolina
but
covered
with
his
gray
mantle
of
charity
the
slave
trade
in
minnesota
when
a
settler
refused
to
exchange
his
wife
or
daughter
with
an
indian
for
a
pony
and
that
indian
massacred
the
whole
family
to
repair
his
wrongs
his
quaker
lawyer
justified
the
act
on
the
score
of
extreme
provocation
and
won
triumphal
acquittal
from
the
jury
of
the
world
when
the
sioux
after
the
bull
run
disaster
arose
as
the
allies
of
the
south
and
butchered
one
thousand
men
women
and
children
in
minnesota
the
quakers
and
other
good
people
flew
to
arms
in
their
defense
and
carried
public
sentiment
in
their
favor
the
agents
of
the
eastern
people
had
delayed
the
payment
of
annuity
three
weeks
and
then
insulted
mr
lo
by
tendering
him
his
money
in
government
bonds
and
for
this
great
wrong
the
peaceable
quaker
the
humanitarian
unitarian
the
orthodox
congregationalist
and
presbyterian
the
enthusiastic
methodist
and
staid
baptist
felt
it
but
right
mr
lo
should
have
his
revenge
most
eastern
christians
are
opposed
to
polygamy
in
utah
and
fourierism
in
france
but
in
minnesota
among
indians
these
institutions
are
sacred
they
demanded
that
england
should
by
law
prohibit
and
other
heathen
customs
in
india
but
nothing
so
rude
as
statutes
must
interfere
with
the
royal
privileges
of
these
western
landlords
if
by
gentle
means
mr
lo
can
be
persuaded
to
stop
taking
all
the
wives
he
can
get
extorting
their
labor
by
the
cudgel
and
selling
them
and
their
children
at
will
all
well
and
good
millions
are
expended
on
the
persuading
business
and
prayer
poured
out
like
the
rains
in
flood
without
any
perceptible
effect
but
still
they
keep
on
paying
and
praying
and
carefully
abstain
from
all
means
at
all
likely
to
accomplish
the
desired
result
all
the
property
of
every
tribe
must
be
held
in
common
so
that
there
can
possibly
be
no
incentive
to
industry
and
economy
but
if
the
indian
refuse
to
be
civilized
on
that
plan
he
must
go
on
taking
scalps
and
being
excused
until
extermination
solve
the
problem
long
before
i
saw
an
indian
on
his
native
soil
the
government
had
spent
millions
in
carrying
out
this
penn
policy
for
long
years
indians
had
sat
like
crows
watching
the
white
farmers
and
artisans
sent
to
teach
them
industry
and
had
grunted
their
honest
contempt
they
watched
the
potato
planting
that
they
might
pick
out
the
seed
for
present
use
they
pulled
down
fences
and
turned
their
ponies
into
the
growing
crops
used
the
rails
for
fire
wood
burned
mills
and
houses
built
for
them
rolled
barrels
of
flour
up
steep
acclivities
started
them
down
and
shouted
to
see
them
leap
and
the
flour
spurt
through
the
staves
knocked
the
heads
out
of
other
barrels
and
let
the
ponies
eat
the
flour
poured
bags
of
corn
on
the
ground
when
they
wanted
the
bag
and
in
every
way
showed
their
contempt
for
the
government
whose
policy
they
believed
to
be
the
result
of
cowardice
thousands
of
dollars
worth
of
agricultural
machinery
lay
rotting
in
the
sun
while
the
noble
red
aristocrat
played
poker
in
the
shade
his
original
contempt
for
labor
intensified
by
his
power
to
extract
a
living
from
laborers
through
their
fear
of
his
scalping
knife
the
chippewa
chief
had
been
educated
by
baptist
missionaries
and
was
a
good
english
scholar
but
would
not
condescend
to
speak
to
the
government
except
through
an
interpreter
for
him
six
hundred
acres
of
land
had
been
fenced
and
a
large
frame
cottage
built
and
painted
white
in
this
he
lived
with
six
wives
and
a
united
states
salary
of
two
thousand
a
year
and
his
traveling
expenses
he
dressed
like
a
white
man
dined
with
state
officers
in
paul
went
to
church
with
a
lady
on
his
arm
sat
in
a
front
pew
and
was
a
highly
distinguished
gentleman
of
the
scalping
school
chapter
xlix
the
indian
massacre
of
the
indians
had
been
ugly
from
the
first
outbreak
of
the
rebellion
and
commissioner
dole
with
senator
wilkinson
had
come
out
to
pacify
them
the
party
passed
through
st
cloud
and
had
camped
several
miles
west
when
in
the
night
there
came
up
one
of
those
sudden
storms
peculiar
to
this
land
their
tents
were
whisked
away
like
autumn
leaves
and
they
left
clinging
to
such
productions
of
mother
nature
as
were
at
hand
well
rooted
in
her
bosom
to
avoid
a
witches
dance
in
the
air
but
it
grew
worse
when
the
rain
had
covered
the
level
ground
six
inches
deep
in
water
and
they
must
keep
their
heads
above
the
surface
they
returned
to
st
cloud
in
the
morning
in
sorry
plight
and
the
delay
was
one
of
the
injuries
to
the
poor
indians
and
counted
as
sufficient
justification
for
the
subsequent
massacre
the
delay
however
saved
their
lives
the
messenger
who
aroused
the
people
of
st
cloud
in
the
small
hours
was
traveling
post
after
this
dole
commission
for
whose
safety
there
was
much
anxiety
but
none
for
st
cloud
since
the
indians
would
not
attack
us
while
there
were
two
companies
of
soldiers
in
town
true
they
were
unarmed
but
surely
arms
would
be
sent
and
their
marching
orders
rescinded
the
outbreak
was
mysterious
it
was
of
course
in
the
interests
of
the
south
and
meant
to
prevent
the
troops
leaving
the
state
but
why
had
not
the
tribes
struck
together
the
answer
was
that
after
the
massacre
had
been
arranged
in
council
two
sioux
visited
a
white
family
in
which
they
had
often
been
entertained
were
drunk
and
could
not
resist
the
impulse
to
butcher
their
entertainers
this
precipitated
the
attack
for
so
soon
as
the
news
reached
the
tribe
they
went
to
work
to
execute
their
bloody
purpose
johnson
a
converted
chippewa
hurried
to
inform
us
that
his
tribe
with
in
council
had
resolved
to
join
the
sioux
and
were
to
have
made
st
cloud
their
base
of
operations
but
the
sioux
had
broken
out
before
the
arms
and
ammunition
came
and
these
they
were
hourly
expecting
on
the
same
day
a
formal
message
came
from
that
commissioner
dole
must
come
to
the
reservation
to
confer
with
his
young
braves
who
would
await
his
arrival
ten
days
after
which
time
their
great
chief
declined
to
be
responsible
for
them
a
runner
arrived
from
abercrombie
who
had
escaped
by
crawling
through
the
grass
and
reported
the
fort
besieged
by
a
thousand
savages
and
quite
unprepared
for
defense
there
were
several
st
cloud
people
in
the
fort
and
so
far
from
expecting
aid
from
it
it
must
be
relieved
the
garrison
at
ripley
had
not
a
man
to
spare
for
outside
defense
people
began
to
pour
into
st
cloud
with
tales
of
horror
to
freeze
the
blood
and
the
worst
reports
were
more
than
confirmed
the
victorious
sioux
had
undisputed
possession
of
the
whole
country
west
southwest
and
northwest
of
us
up
to
within
twelve
miles
of
the
city
and
had
left
few
people
to
tell
tales
our
troops
spent
their
time
teaching
women
and
children
the
use
of
firearms
and
hoping
for
arms
and
orders
to
go
to
the
relief
of
abercrombie
there
was
no
telegraph
and
the
last
mail
left
no
alternative
but
to
start
for
fort
snelling
with
such
short
time
to
get
there
that
every
available
man
and
horse
must
go
to
hurry
them
forward
they
left
in
the
afternoon
and
that
was
a
dreadful
night
many
of
the
more
timid
women
had
gone
east
but
of
those
that
remained
some
paced
the
streets
wringing
their
hands
and
sobbing
out
their
fear
and
despair
and
sorrow
for
the
husbands
and
brothers
and
sons
taken
from
them
at
such
a
crisis
when
the
troops
left
we
thought
there
were
no
more
men
in
st
cloud
but
next
morning
found
a
dozen
counting
the
boys
who
were
organized
to
go
out
west
to
the
rescue
of
settlers
and
still
there
were
some
guards
and
pickets
and
some
who
did
nothing
but
find
fault
with
everything
any
one
else
did
men
and
women
spoke
with
stiffened
lips
and
blanched
faces
families
in
the
outskirts
gathered
to
more
central
places
and
there
were
women
and
children
in
my
house
the
night
after
the
troops
left
and
for
every
night
for
weeks
we
kept
large
kettles
of
boiling
water
as
one
means
of
defense
i
always
had
the
watchword
and
often
at
midnight
i
would
go
out
to
see
that
the
pickets
were
on
duty
and
report
to
the
women
that
all
was
well
brother
harry
was
appointed
general
of
state
troops
succeeding
lowrie
and
arms
were
sent
to
him
for
distribution
while
women
kept
muskets
by
them
and
practiced
daily
the
office
of
my
democratic
contemporary
was
closed
and
he
fled
to
new
england
while
his
assistant
went
with
my
only
male
assistant
to
rescue
settlers
i
had
two
young
ladies
in
the
office
one
a
graduate
of
a
new
york
high
school
and
through
all
the
excitement
they
kept
at
work
as
coolly
as
at
any
other
time
we
got
out
the
paper
regularly
and
published
many
extras
the
history
of
the
horrors
and
heroisms
which
reached
us
during
the
six
weeks
in
which
abercrombie
held
out
until
relief
came
would
make
a
volume
and
can
not
he
written
here
the
unimaginable
tortures
and
indecencies
inflicted
on
brave
men
and
good
women
are
something
for
which
the
christian
supporters
and
excusers
of
the
sioux
must
yet
account
at
the
bar
where
sentimental
sympathy
with
criminals
is
itself
a
crime
and
where
the
wail
of
tortured
infants
will
not
be
hushed
by
reckoning
of
bad
beef
and
a
deficiency
in
beans
while
the
sioux
sat
in
council
to
determine
that
butchery
some
objected
on
the
ground
that
such
crimes
would
be
punished
but
little
crow
leader
of
the
war
party
quieted
their
fears
by
saying
white
man
no
like
indian
indian
catch
white
man
roast
him
kill
him
white
man
catch
indian
feed
him
give
him
blankets
and
on
this
assurance
they
acted
one
thing
was
clearly
proven
by
that
outbreak
viz
that
services
to
and
friendship
for
indians
are
the
best
means
of
incurring
their
revenge
those
families
who
had
been
on
most
intimate
terms
with
them
were
those
who
were
massacred
first
and
with
the
greatest
atrocities
the
more
frequently
they
had
eaten
salt
with
a
the
more
insatiable
was
their
desire
for
vengeance
the
missionaries
were
generally
spared
as
the
source
through
which
they
expected
pardon
and
supplies
the
indian
was
much
too
cunning
to
kill
the
goose
that
laid
the
golden
egg
the
tribe
do
not
object
to
the
conversion
of
individuals
saying
prayers
does
not
interfere
with
their
ideas
of
their
own
importance
preachers
do
not
labor
with
their
hands
and
indians
can
join
the
clerical
order
or
get
religion
without
losing
caste
for
labor
to
them
is
pollution
two
wagon
loads
of
arms
and
ammunition
for
were
intercepted
during
the
massacre
and
for
want
of
them
he
was
induced
to
keep
quiet
for
being
such
a
good
indian
he
had
a
triumphal
trip
to
washington
at
government
expense
got
ten
thousand
dollars
and
a
seventh
wife
chapter
a
missive
and
a
mission
soon
after
the
people
had
returned
to
such
homes
as
were
left
them
i
received
a
letter
from
general
lowrie
who
was
then
in
an
insane
asylum
in
cincinnati
i
caught
his
humor
and
answered
as
carefully
as
if
he
had
been
a
sick
brother
gave
an
extract
in
the
accompanied
by
a
notice
and
sent
him
a
copy
after
which
he
wrote
frequently
and
i
tried
earnestly
to
soothe
him
in
one
of
his
letters
was
this
passage
your
quarrel
and
mine
was
all
wrong
there
was
no
one
in
that
upper
country
capable
of
understanding
you
but
me
no
one
capable
of
understanding
me
but
you
we
should
have
been
friends
and
would
have
been
if
we
had
not
each
had
a
self
which
we
were
all
too
anxious
to
defend
after
the
sioux
had
finished
their
work
of
horror
minnesota
men
aided
by
volunteers
from
iowa
and
wisconsin
pursued
and
captured
the
murderers
of
one
thousand
men
women
and
children
tried
them
found
them
guilty
and
proposed
to
hang
them
just
as
if
they
had
been
white
murderers
but
when
the
general
government
interfered
and
took
the
prisoners
out
of
the
hands
of
the
state
authorities
and
when
it
became
evident
that
eastern
people
endorsed
the
massacre
and
condemned
the
victims
as
sinners
who
deserved
their
fate
one
of
the
state
officers
proposed
that
i
should
go
east
try
to
counteract
the
vicious
public
sentiment
and
aid
our
congressional
delegation
in
their
effort
to
induce
the
administration
either
to
hang
the
sioux
murderers
or
hold
them
as
hostages
during
the
war
to
me
this
was
a
providential
call
for
i
had
been
planning
to
make
a
home
in
the
east
that
our
daughter
then
old
enough
to
live
without
me
might
spend
a
portion
of
her
time
with
her
father
with
letters
from
all
our
state
officers
i
left
my
minnesota
home
at
four
january
leaving
the
in
charge
of
my
first
apprentice
william
mitchell
in
washington
the
minnesota
delegation
secured
the
use
of
sutherland
church
and
a
packed
audience
for
my
lecture
on
indians
it
was
enthusiastically
applauded
and
for
a
time
i
did
hope
for
some
security
for
women
and
children
on
the
frontier
but
the
secretary
of
the
interior
assured
me
it
was
not
worth
while
to
see
the
president
for
lincoln
will
hang
nobody
and
our
minnesota
delegation
agreed
with
him
indeed
there
was
such
a
of
pious
pity
for
the
poor
injured
sioux
such
admiration
for
their
long
suffering
patience
under
wrong
and
final
heroic
resistance
that
i
might
about
as
well
have
tried
to
row
myself
from
the
head
of
goat
island
up
the
rapids
of
niagara
as
stem
that
current
the
ring
which
makes
money
by
caudling
indians
had
the
ear
of
both
president
and
people
and
the
bureau
had
a
paying
contract
in
proving
little
crow
sagacity
the
sioux
never
were
so
well
supplied
with
blankets
and
as
when
they
received
their
reward
for
that
massacre
never
had
so
many
prayers
said
and
hymns
sung
over
them
and
their
steamboat
ride
down
the
minnesota
and
mississippi
and
up
the
missouri
to
a
point
within
two
days
walk
of
the
scene
of
their
exploits
furnished
them
an
excursion
of
about
two
thousand
miles
and
left
them
well
prepared
for
future
operations
they
appreciated
their
good
fortune
have
been
a
terror
to
united
states
troops
and
western
settlers
ever
since
and
have
enjoyed
their
triumph
to
the
full
one
morning
senator
wilkinson
and
i
went
to
see
the
president
and
in
the
vestibule
of
the
white
house
met
two
gentlemen
whom
he
introduced
as
sec
stanton
and
fremont
the
first
said
he
needed
no
introduction
and
i
said
i
had
asked
senator
wilkinson
to
see
him
on
my
account
he
replied
do
not
ask
any
one
to
see
me
if
you
want
anything
from
me
come
yourself
no
one
can
have
more
influence
fremont
inquired
where
i
was
staying
and
said
he
would
call
on
me
this
frightened
me
and
i
felt
like
running
away
but
they
were
so
kind
and
cordial
that
our
short
chat
is
a
pleasant
memory
but
wilkinson
and
i
failed
to
see
lincoln
next
day
sec
stanton
gave
me
an
appointment
in
the
quarter
master
general
office
but
there
was
no
place
for
me
to
go
to
work
fremont
called
at
the
houses
of
two
friends
where
i
was
visiting
but
both
times
i
was
absent
in
i
had
also
missed
the
calls
of
his
wife
and
sister
and
so
i
seemed
destined
never
to
meet
the
people
i
admired
above
all
others
my
friends
wished
me
to
attend
a
presidential
reception
but
it
was
useless
to
see
lincoln
on
the
business
which
brought
me
to
washington
and
i
did
not
care
to
see
him
on
any
other
he
had
proved
an
obstructionist
instead
of
an
abolitionist
and
i
felt
no
respect
for
him
while
his
wife
was
every
where
spoken
of
as
a
southern
woman
with
southern
sympathies
a
conspirator
against
the
union
i
wanted
nothing
to
do
with
the
occupants
of
the
white
house
but
was
told
i
could
go
and
see
the
spectacle
without
being
presented
so
i
went
in
my
broadcloth
traveling
dress
and
lest
there
should
be
trouble
about
my
early
would
not
trust
my
cloak
to
the
servants
but
walked
through
the
hall
with
it
over
my
arm
i
watched
the
president
and
lincoln
receive
his
sad
earnest
honest
face
was
irresistible
in
its
plea
for
confidence
and
lincoln
manner
was
so
simple
and
motherly
so
unlike
that
of
all
southern
women
i
had
seen
that
i
doubted
the
tales
i
had
heard
her
head
was
not
that
of
a
conspirator
she
would
be
incapable
of
a
successful
deceit
and
whatever
her
purposes
were
they
must
be
known
to
all
who
knew
her
lincoln
stood
going
through
one
of
those
dreadful
ordeals
of
working
like
a
man
pumping
for
life
on
a
sinking
vessel
and
i
was
filled
with
indignation
for
the
selfish
people
who
made
this
useless
drain
on
his
nervous
force
i
wanted
to
stand
between
him
and
them
and
say
stand
back
and
let
him
live
and
do
his
work
but
i
could
not
resist
going
to
him
with
the
rest
of
the
crowd
and
when
he
took
my
hand
i
said
may
the
lord
have
mercy
on
you
poor
man
for
the
people
have
none
he
laughed
heartily
and
the
men
around
him
joined
in
his
merriment
when
i
came
to
lincoln
she
did
not
catch
the
name
at
first
and
asked
to
hear
it
again
then
repeated
it
and
a
sudden
glow
of
pleasure
lit
her
face
as
she
held
out
her
hand
and
said
how
very
glad
she
was
to
see
me
i
objected
to
giving
her
my
hand
because
my
black
glove
would
soil
her
white
one
but
she
said
then
i
shall
preserve
the
glove
to
remember
a
great
pleasure
for
i
have
long
wished
to
see
you
my
escort
was
more
surprised
than
i
by
her
unusual
cordiality
and
said
afterwards
it
was
no
polite
affectation
i
can
not
understand
it
from
her
i
understood
at
once
that
i
had
met
one
with
whom
i
was
in
sympathy
no
politeness
could
have
summoned
that
sudden
flash
of
pleasure
her
manner
was
too
simple
and
natural
to
have
any
art
in
it
and
why
should
she
have
pretended
a
friendship
she
did
not
feel
abolitionists
were
at
a
discount
they
had
gone
like
the
front
ranks
of
the
french
cavalry
at
waterloo
into
the
sunken
way
to
make
a
bridge
over
which
moderate
men
were
rushing
to
honors
and
emoluments
gideon
army
had
done
its
work
and
given
place
to
the
camp
followers
who
gathered
up
the
spoils
of
victory
none
wore
so
poor
that
they
need
do
them
reverence
and
i
recognized
lincoln
as
a
loyal
woman
more
staunch
even
than
her
husband
in
opposition
to
the
rebellion
and
its
cause
and
as
my
very
dear
friend
for
life
chapter
li
no
use
for
me
among
the
wounded
i
had
not
thought
even
after
deciding
to
remain
in
washington
of
doing
any
hospital
work
knew
nothing
about
it
and
in
strength
was
more
like
a
patient
than
a
nurse
but
while
i
waited
for
a
summons
to
go
to
the
duties
of
my
clerkship
i
met
some
ladies
interested
in
hospitals
one
of
these
thayer
had
an
ambulance
at
her
command
and
took
me
for
a
day
visiting
among
the
forts
on
a
day
when
it
was
known
that
our
armies
in
virginia
were
engaged
with
the
enemy
the
roads
were
almost
impassable
and
as
a
skillful
driver
and
two
good
horses
used
their
best
efforts
to
take
us
from
place
to
place
i
felt
like
a
thief
that
ambulance
ought
to
be
at
the
front
and
us
with
it
or
on
our
knees
pleading
for
the
men
whose
breasts
were
a
living
wall
between
us
and
danger
between
liberty
and
her
deadly
foes
the
men
in
the
forts
had
no
special
need
of
us
and
sometimes
their
thanks
for
the
tracts
we
brought
them
gave
an
impulse
to
strike
them
square
in
the
face
but
thayer
was
happy
in
her
work
and
thought
me
uncivil
to
her
friends
we
reached
the
last
fort
on
our
round
before
i
saw
anything
interesting
and
here
a
sorrowful
woman
drew
me
aside
to
tell
me
of
the
two
weeks
she
had
spent
with
her
husband
now
in
the
last
stage
of
and
of
her
fruitless
efforts
to
get
sufficient
straw
for
his
bed
while
the
bones
were
cutting
through
the
skin
as
he
lay
on
the
slats
of
his
cot
she
wrung
her
hands
in
a
strange
suppressed
agony
and
exclaimed
oh
if
they
had
only
let
me
take
him
home
when
i
came
first
but
say
nothing
here
or
they
will
not
let
me
stay
i
verified
her
statement
of
her
husband
condition
so
that
i
could
speak
from
observation
without
compromising
her
and
spoke
to
the
surgeon
who
politely
regretted
the
scarcity
of
straw
and
hoped
to
get
some
soon
i
returned
to
the
sufferer
who
was
from
new
hampshire
and
a
very
intelligent
man
and
after
talking
with
him
and
his
wife
concluded
to
look
up
the
commander
of
that
fort
and
put
some
powder
and
a
lighted
match
into
his
ear
but
first
consulted
thayer
who
begged
me
to
take
no
notice
else
she
would
no
longer
be
permitted
to
visit
the
fort
she
had
introduced
me
to
two
fashionably
dressed
ladies
wifes
resident
there
and
when
i
must
say
or
do
nothing
about
this
man
lest
i
should
destroy
thayer
opportunity
for
doing
good
i
concluded
we
had
discovered
a
new
variety
of
savage
and
came
away
thinking
i
could
do
something
in
the
city
next
morning
i
stated
the
case
to
miss
dix
who
was
neither
shocked
nor
surprised
i
had
never
before
seen
her
but
her
tall
angular
person
very
red
face
and
totally
unsympathetic
manner
chilled
me
the
best
ambulance
in
the
service
was
exclusively
devoted
to
her
use
and
i
thought
she
would
surely
go
or
send
a
bed
to
that
man
before
noon
but
she
proposed
to
do
nothing
of
the
kind
had
engagements
for
the
day
which
seemed
to
me
of
small
import
compared
to
that
of
placing
that
man
on
a
comfortable
bed
but
she
could
do
nothing
that
day
by
reason
of
these
engagements
and
nothing
next
day
it
being
sunday
on
which
day
she
attended
to
no
business
we
spoke
of
the
great
battle
then
in
progress
and
i
tendered
my
services
could
take
no
regular
appointment
would
want
no
pay
could
not
work
long
but
might
be
of
use
in
an
emergency
emergencies
were
things
of
which
she
had
no
conception
everything
in
her
world
moved
by
rule
and
her
arrangements
were
complete
she
had
sent
eight
nurses
to
the
front
and
more
could
only
be
in
the
way
i
inquired
about
hospital
supplies
and
she
grew
almost
enthusiastic
in
explaining
the
uselessness
nay
absurdity
of
sending
any
government
furnished
everything
that
could
possibly
be
wanted
the
sanitary
and
christian
commissioners
were
all
a
mistake
soldiers
aid
societies
a
delusion
and
a
snare
she
was
burdened
with
stores
sent
to
her
for
which
there
was
no
use
and
she
hoped
i
would
use
my
influence
to
stop
the
business
of
sending
supplies
from
her
i
went
direct
to
the
sanitary
commission
and
found
a
large
house
full
of
salaried
clerks
and
porters
and
boxes
and
bails
although
this
was
not
their
storehouse
here
again
i
stated
the
case
of
the
man
without
a
bed
and
found
listeners
neither
surprised
nor
shocked
every
one
seemed
quite
familiar
with
trifles
of
that
nature
and
by
and
by
i
too
would
look
upon
them
with
indifference
i
do
not
remember
whether
it
was
saturday
engagements
or
sunday
sanctity
or
lack
of
jurisdiction
which
barred
the
commission
from
interference
but
think
they
must
wait
until
the
fort
surgeon
sent
a
requisition
i
inquired
here
about
hospital
stores
and
found
there
was
great
demand
for
everything
especially
money
they
declined
my
services
in
every
capacity
save
that
of
inducing
the
public
to
hurry
forward
funds
and
supplies
i
told
them
of
miss
dix
opinion
on
that
subject
and
they
agreed
that
it
was
quite
useless
to
send
anything
to
her
since
she
used
nothing
she
received
and
would
not
permit
any
one
else
to
use
stores
late
in
the
next
week
thayer
came
in
great
tribulation
to
know
how
i
ever
could
have
done
so
foolish
and
useless
a
thing
as
report
that
case
to
miss
dix
oh
dear
oh
dear
it
was
so
unwise
miss
dix
had
gone
to
the
fort
on
monday
taken
the
surgeon
to
task
about
that
bed
gave
me
as
her
authority
and
for
me
thayer
was
responsible
and
would
be
excluded
from
that
fort
on
account
of
my
indiscretion
there
was
another
standing
quarrel
between
the
directress
of
nurses
and
the
surgeons
the
bitterness
engendered
would
all
be
visited
upon
the
patients
and
it
was
so
deplorable
to
think
i
had
been
so
imprudent
her
distress
was
so
real
and
she
was
so
real
in
her
desire
to
do
good
that
i
felt
myself
quite
a
culprit
especially
as
the
man
got
no
bed
and
died
on
his
slats
i
was
so
lectured
and
warned
about
the
sin
of
this
my
first
offense
in
telling
that
which
folk
wad
secret
keep
in
hospital
management
that
i
was
afraid
to
go
to
another
lest
i
should
get
some
one
into
trouble
so
stayed
at
home
while
the
washington
hospitals
were
being
filled
with
wounded
from
the
battle
of
chancellorville
i
think
it
was
the
afternoon
of
the
second
sabbath
that
i
went
with
kelsey
to
visit
campbell
to
get
material
for
a
letter
and
tendered
my
services
but
their
arrangements
were
complete
passing
through
the
wards
it
did
indeed
seem
as
if
nothing
was
wanting
as
a
matter
of
form
i
asked
james
bride
of
wisconsin
if
there
was
anything
i
could
do
for
him
was
surprised
to
see
him
hesitate
and
astounded
to
have
him
answer
well
nothing
particular
unless
he
stopped
and
picked
at
the
coverlid
unless
you
could
get
us
something
to
quench
thirst
something
to
quench
thirst
why
i
have
been
told
you
have
everything
you
can
possibly
require
well
they
are
very
good
to
us
and
do
all
they
can
but
it
gets
very
hot
in
here
in
the
afternoons
we
can
not
go
out
into
the
shade
and
get
so
thirsty
drinking
so
much
water
makes
us
sick
and
if
we
had
something
a
little
sour
but
would
they
let
me
bring
you
anything
o
yes
i
see
ladies
bring
things
every
day
then
i
shall
be
glad
to
bring
you
something
tomorrow
chapter
lii
find
work
that
morning
i
wrote
to
the
new
york
relating
the
incident
of
the
man
asking
for
cooling
drinks
and
saying
that
if
people
furnished
the
material
i
would
devote
my
time
to
distributing
their
gifts
next
morning
i
got
two
dozen
lemons
pressed
the
juice
into
a
jar
put
in
sugar
took
a
glass
and
spoon
and
so
soon
as
visitors
were
admitted
began
giving
lemonade
to
those
men
who
seemed
to
have
most
need
going
to
the
water
tank
for
every
glass
of
water
made
it
slow
work
but
i
improved
my
walks
by
talking
to
the
men
hearing
their
wants
and
adding
to
their
stock
of
hope
and
cheerfulness
and
was
glad
to
see
that
the
nurses
did
not
seem
to
object
to
my
presence
even
though
campbell
was
the
one
only
hospital
in
the
city
from
which
female
nurses
were
rigorously
excluded
so
noted
had
it
become
for
the
masculine
pride
of
its
management
that
i
had
been
warned
not
to
stay
past
the
length
of
an
ordinary
visit
lest
i
should
be
roughly
told
to
go
away
and
my
surprise
was
equal
to
my
pleasure
when
a
man
came
and
said
would
it
not
be
easier
for
you
if
you
had
a
pitcher
i
said
it
would
but
that
i
lived
too
far
away
to
bring
one
oh
i
will
bring
you
a
pitcher
why
did
you
not
ask
for
one
i
did
not
want
to
trouble
you
for
they
told
me
you
did
not
like
to
have
women
here
he
laughed
and
said
i
guess
we
all
be
glad
enough
to
have
you
not
many
of
your
sort
first
thing
they
all
do
is
to
begin
to
make
trouble
and
it
always
takes
two
men
to
wait
on
one
of
them
he
brought
the
pitcher
and
i
felt
that
i
was
getting
on
in
the
world
still
i
was
very
humble
and
careful
to
win
the
favor
of
the
chamberlain
those
potencies
the
nurses
who
might
report
me
to
that
royal
baxter
surgeon
in
charge
whose
name
was
a
terror
to
women
who
intruded
themselves
into
military
hospitals
as
i
passed
with
my
pitcher
i
saw
one
man
delerious
and
expectorating
profusely
a
matter
green
as
grass
could
be
knew
this
was
hospital
gangrene
and
remembered
all
palmer
had
told
me
years
before
of
his
experience
in
paris
hospitals
and
the
antidotes
to
that
and
scurvey
poison
indeed
the
results
of
many
conversations
with
physicians
and
of
some
reading
on
the
subject
of
camp
diseases
came
to
me
and
i
knew
just
what
was
wanted
here
but
saw
no
sign
that
the
want
was
likely
to
be
supplied
for
this
man
it
was
too
late
but
i
could
not
see
that
anything
was
being
done
to
prevent
the
spread
of
this
fearful
scourge
passing
from
that
ward
into
the
one
adjoining
i
came
suddenly
upon
two
nurses
dressing
a
thigh
stump
while
the
patient
filled
the
air
with
shrieks
and
groans
i
had
never
before
seen
a
stump
but
remembered
jackson
lecture
over
the
watermellon
at
desert
on
amputation
for
the
benefit
of
charles
sumner
and
electricity
never
brought
light
quicker
than
there
came
to
me
the
memory
of
all
he
had
said
about
the
proper
arrangement
of
the
muscles
over
the
end
of
the
bone
and
added
to
this
came
a
perfect
knowledge
of
the
relations
of
those
mangled
muscles
to
the
general
form
of
the
body
i
saw
that
the
nurse
who
held
the
stump
tortured
the
man
by
disregarding
natural
law
and
setting
down
pitcher
and
glass
on
the
floor
i
stepped
up
knelt
slipped
my
hands
under
the
remains
of
that
strong
thigh
and
said
to
the
man
who
held
it
now
slip
out
your
hands
easy
easy
there
the
instant
it
rested
on
my
hands
the
groans
ceased
and
i
said
is
that
better
oh
my
god
yes
well
then
i
will
always
hold
it
when
it
is
dressed
but
you
will
not
be
here
i
will
come
that
would
be
too
much
trouble
i
have
nothing
else
to
do
and
will
think
it
no
trouble
the
nurse
who
did
the
dressing
was
very
gentle
and
there
was
no
more
pain
but
i
saw
that
the
other
leg
was
amputated
below
the
knee
and
this
was
a
double
reason
why
he
should
be
tenderly
cared
for
so
i
took
the
nurse
aside
and
asked
when
the
wounds
were
to
be
dressed
again
he
said
in
the
morning
and
promised
to
wait
until
i
came
to
help
next
morning
i
was
so
much
afraid
of
being
late
that
i
would
not
wait
for
the
street
cars
to
begin
running
but
walked
the
guard
objected
to
admitting
me
as
it
was
not
time
for
visitors
but
i
explained
and
he
let
me
pass
i
must
not
go
through
the
wards
at
that
hour
so
went
around
and
came
in
by
the
door
near
which
he
lay
what
was
my
surprise
to
find
that
not
only
were
his
wounds
dressed
but
that
all
his
clothing
and
bed
had
been
changed
and
everything
about
him
made
as
white
and
neat
and
square
as
if
he
were
a
corpse
which
he
more
resembled
than
a
living
man
oh
what
a
tribute
of
agony
he
had
paid
to
the
demon
of
appearance
we
all
pay
heavy
taxes
to
other
people
eyes
but
on
none
is
the
levy
quite
so
onerous
as
on
the
patients
of
a
model
hospital
i
saw
that
he
breathed
and
slept
and
knew
his
time
was
short
but
sought
the
head
nurse
and
asked
why
he
had
not
waited
for
me
he
hesitated
stammered
blushed
and
said
why
the
fact
is
sister
he
has
another
wound
that
it
would
not
be
pleasant
for
you
to
see
do
you
mean
that
that
man
has
a
groin
wound
in
addition
to
all
else
yes
sister
yes
and
i
thought
no
matter
what
you
thought
you
have
tortured
him
to
save
your
and
mine
you
could
have
dressed
that
other
wound
covered
him
and
let
me
hold
the
stump
you
saw
what
relief
it
gave
him
yesterday
how
could
you
how
dare
you
torture
him
well
sister
i
have
been
in
hospitals
with
sisters
a
great
deal
and
they
never
help
to
dress
wounds
i
thought
you
would
not
get
leave
to
come
would
not
like
to
i
am
not
a
sister
i
am
a
mother
and
that
man
had
suffered
enough
oh
how
dared
you
how
dared
you
to
do
such
a
thing
i
wrung
my
hands
and
he
trembled
like
a
leaf
and
said
it
was
wrong
but
i
did
not
know
i
never
saw
a
sister
before
i
tell
you
i
am
no
sister
and
i
can
not
think
whatever
your
sisters
are
good
for
he
promised
to
let
me
help
him
whenever
it
would
save
pain
and
i
returned
to
the
dying
man
the
sun
shone
and
birds
sang
he
stirred
opened
his
eyes
smiled
to
see
me
and
said
it
is
a
lovely
morning
and
i
will
soon
be
gone
i
said
yes
the
winter
of
your
life
is
past
for
you
the
reign
of
sorrow
is
over
and
gone
the
spring
time
appears
on
the
earth
and
the
time
for
the
singing
of
birds
has
come
your
immortal
summer
is
close
at
hand
christ
who
loveth
us
and
has
suffered
for
us
has
prepared
mansions
of
rest
for
those
who
love
him
and
you
are
going
soon
oh
yes
i
know
he
will
take
me
home
and
provide
for
my
wife
and
children
when
i
am
gone
then
all
is
well
with
you
he
told
me
his
name
and
residence
in
pittsburg
and
i
remembered
that
his
parents
lived
our
near
neighbors
when
i
was
a
child
so
more
than
ever
i
regretted
that
i
could
not
have
made
his
passage
through
the
dark
valley
one
of
less
pain
but
it
was
a
comfort
to
his
wife
to
know
i
had
been
with
him
when
he
slept
again
i
got
a
slightly
wounded
man
to
sit
by
him
and
keep
away
the
flies
while
i
went
to
distribute
some
delicacies
brought
to
him
by
visitors
and
which
he
would
never
need
at
the
door
of
ward
three
a
large
man
stood
and
seemed
to
be
an
officer
i
asked
him
if
there
were
any
patients
in
that
ward
who
would
need
wine
penado
he
looked
down
at
me
pleasantly
and
said
i
think
it
very
likely
madam
for
it
is
a
very
bad
ward
it
was
indeed
a
very
bad
ward
for
a
settled
gloom
lay
upon
the
faces
of
the
occupants
who
suffered
because
the
and
entire
set
of
nurses
had
recently
been
discharged
and
new
incompetent
men
appointed
in
their
places
as
i
passed
down
turning
from
right
to
left
to
give
to
such
men
as
needed
it
the
mild
stimulant
i
had
brought
i
saw
how
sad
and
hopeless
they
were
only
one
man
seemed
inclined
to
talk
and
he
sat
near
the
centre
of
the
ward
while
some
one
dressed
his
shoulder
from
which
the
arm
had
been
carried
away
by
a
cannon
ball
a
group
of
men
stood
around
him
talking
of
that
strange
amputation
and
he
was
full
of
chat
and
cheerfulness
they
called
him
charlie
but
my
attention
was
quickly
drawn
to
a
young
man
on
a
cot
close
by
who
was
suffering
torture
from
the
awkwardness
of
a
nurse
who
was
dressing
a
large
on
the
outside
of
his
right
thigh
i
set
my
bowl
on
the
floor
caught
the
nurse
wrist
lifted
his
hand
away
and
said
oh
stop
you
are
hurting
that
man
let
me
do
that
he
replied
pleasantly
i
be
very
glad
to
for
i
a
green
hand
i
took
his
place
saw
the
wounded
flesh
creep
at
the
touch
of
cold
water
and
said
cold
water
hurts
you
yes
a
little
then
we
must
have
some
warm
but
nurse
said
there
was
none
no
warm
water
i
exclaimed
as
i
drew
back
and
looked
at
him
in
blank
astonishment
no
there
no
warm
water
how
many
wounded
men
have
you
in
this
hospital
well
about
seven
hundred
i
believe
about
seven
hundred
wounded
men
and
no
warm
water
so
none
of
them
get
anything
to
eat
oh
yes
they
get
plenty
to
eat
and
how
do
you
cook
without
warm
water
why
there
plenty
of
hot
water
in
the
kitchen
but
we
not
allowed
to
go
there
and
we
have
none
in
the
wards
where
is
the
kitchen
he
directed
me
i
covered
the
wound
told
the
patient
to
wait
and
i
would
get
warm
water
in
the
kitchen
a
dozen
cooks
stopped
to
stare
at
me
but
one
gave
me
what
i
came
for
and
on
returning
to
the
ward
i
said
to
charlie
now
you
can
have
some
warm
water
if
you
want
it
but
i
do
not
want
it
i
like
cold
water
best
then
it
is
best
for
you
but
it
is
not
best
for
this
man
i
had
never
before
seen
any
such
wound
as
the
one
i
was
dressing
but
i
could
think
of
but
one
way
clean
it
thoroughly
put
on
clean
lint
and
rags
and
bandages
without
hurting
the
patient
and
this
was
very
easy
to
do
but
while
i
did
this
i
wanted
to
do
something
more
viz
dispel
the
gloom
which
hung
over
that
ward
i
knew
that
sick
folks
should
have
their
minds
occupied
by
pleasant
thoughts
and
never
addressed
an
audience
with
more
care
than
i
talked
to
that
one
man
in
appearance
while
really
talking
to
all
those
who
lay
before
me
and
some
to
whom
my
back
was
turned
i
could
modulate
my
voice
so
as
to
be
heard
at
quite
a
distance
and
yet
cause
no
jar
to
very
sensitive
nerves
close
at
hand
and
when
i
told
my
patient
that
i
proposed
to
punish
him
now
while
he
was
in
my
power
all
heard
and
wondered
then
every
one
was
stimulated
to
learn
that
it
was
to
keep
him
humble
because
having
received
such
a
wound
in
the
charge
on
marie
hill
he
would
be
so
proud
by
and
by
that
common
folks
would
be
afraid
to
speak
to
him
i
should
be
quite
thrown
into
the
shade
by
his
laurels
and
should
probably
take
my
revenge
in
advance
by
sticking
pins
in
him
now
when
he
could
not
help
himself
this
idea
proved
to
be
quite
amusing
and
before
i
had
secured
that
bandage
the
men
seemed
to
have
forgotten
their
wounds
except
as
a
source
of
future
pride
and
were
firing
jokes
at
each
other
as
rapidly
as
they
had
done
bullets
at
the
enemy
when
therefore
i
proposed
sticking
pins
into
any
one
else
who
desired
such
punishment
there
was
quite
a
demand
for
my
services
and
with
my
basin
of
tepid
water
i
started
to
wet
the
hard
dry
dressings
and
leave
them
to
soften
before
being
removed
before
night
i
discovered
that
lint
is
an
instrument
of
incalculable
torture
and
should
never
be
used
as
either
blood
or
pus
quickly
converts
some
portion
of
it
into
splints
as
irritating
as
a
pine
shaving
chapter
liii
hospital
gangrene
about
nine
i
returned
to
the
man
i
had
come
to
help
and
found
that
he
still
slept
i
hoped
he
might
rouse
and
have
some
further
message
for
his
wife
before
death
had
finished
his
work
and
so
remained
with
him
although
i
was
much
needed
in
the
very
bad
ward
i
had
sat
by
him
but
a
few
moments
when
i
noticed
a
green
shade
on
his
face
it
darkened
and
his
breathing
grew
labored
then
ceased
i
think
it
was
not
more
than
twenty
minutes
from
the
time
i
observed
the
green
tinge
until
he
was
gone
i
called
the
nurse
who
brought
the
large
man
i
had
seen
at
the
door
of
the
bad
ward
and
now
i
knew
he
was
a
surgeon
knew
also
by
the
sudden
shadow
on
his
face
when
he
saw
the
corpse
that
he
was
alarmed
and
when
he
had
given
minute
directions
for
the
removal
of
the
bed
and
its
contents
the
washing
of
the
floor
and
sprinkling
with
chloride
of
lime
i
went
close
to
his
side
and
said
in
a
low
voice
doctor
is
not
this
hospital
gangrene
he
looked
down
at
me
seemed
to
take
my
measure
and
answered
i
am
very
sorry
to
say
madam
that
it
is
then
you
want
lemons
we
would
be
glad
to
have
them
glad
to
have
them
i
repeated
in
profound
astonishment
why
you
have
them
he
seemed
surprised
at
my
earnestness
and
set
about
explaining
we
sent
to
the
sanitary
commission
last
week
and
got
half
a
box
sanitary
commission
and
half
a
box
of
lemons
how
many
wounded
have
you
seven
hundred
and
fifty
seven
hundred
and
fifty
wounded
men
hospital
gangrene
and
half
a
box
of
lemons
well
that
was
all
we
could
get
government
provides
none
but
our
chaplain
is
from
boston
his
wife
has
written
to
friends
there
and
expects
a
box
next
week
to
boston
for
a
box
of
lemons
i
went
to
the
head
nurse
whom
i
had
scolded
in
the
morning
who
now
gave
me
writing
materials
and
i
wrote
a
short
note
to
the
york
hospital
gangrene
has
broken
out
in
washington
and
we
want
lemons
lemons
no
man
or
woman
in
health
has
a
right
to
a
glass
of
lemonade
until
these
men
have
all
they
need
send
us
lemons
i
signed
my
name
and
mailed
it
immediately
and
it
appeared
next
morning
that
day
schuyler
colfax
sent
a
box
to
my
lodgings
and
five
dollars
in
a
note
bidding
me
send
to
him
if
more
were
wanting
but
that
day
lemons
began
to
pour
into
washington
and
soon
i
think
into
every
hospital
in
the
land
gov
andrews
sent
two
hundred
boxes
to
the
surgeon
general
i
received
so
many
that
at
one
time
there
were
twenty
ladies
several
of
them
with
ambulances
distributing
those
which
came
to
my
address
and
if
there
was
any
more
hospital
gangrene
that
season
i
neither
saw
nor
heard
of
it
the
officers
in
campbell
knew
of
the
letter
and
were
glad
of
the
supplies
it
brought
but
some
time
passed
before
they
identified
the
writer
as
the
little
sister
in
the
bad
ward
who
had
won
the
reputation
of
being
the
best
in
washington
chapter
liv
get
permission
to
work
rules
required
me
to
leave
campbell
at
five
but
the
sun
was
going
down
and
i
lay
on
a
cot
in
the
bad
ward
feeling
that
going
home
or
anywhere
else
was
impossible
when
that
large
doctor
came
felt
my
pulse
laid
his
hand
on
my
brow
and
said
you
must
not
work
so
hard
or
we
will
lose
you
i
have
been
hunting
for
you
to
ask
if
you
would
like
to
remain
with
us
like
to
remain
with
you
well
you
will
have
to
send
a
file
of
soldiers
with
fixed
bayonets
to
drive
me
away
he
laughed
quite
heartily
and
said
we
do
not
want
you
to
go
away
i
am
executive
officer
surgeon
kelley
and
baxter
surgeon
in
charge
has
commissioned
me
to
say
that
if
you
wish
to
stay
he
will
have
a
room
prepared
for
you
he
hunted
for
you
to
say
so
in
person
but
is
gone
now
i
await
your
decision
shall
i
order
you
a
room
surgeon
baxter
why
what
does
he
know
about
me
oh
surgeon
baxter
two
medical
inspectors
and
the
surgeon
of
this
ward
were
present
this
morning
when
you
came
in
and
took
possession
his
black
eyes
twinkled
and
he
shook
with
laughter
when
i
sat
up
clasped
my
hands
and
said
oh
dear
were
they
the
men
who
were
standing
around
charlie
why
i
had
not
dreamed
of
them
being
surgeons
did
you
not
know
by
their
shoulders
traps
shoulderstraps
do
surgeons
have
shoulderstraps
i
thought
only
officers
wore
them
well
surgeons
are
officers
and
you
can
know
by
my
shoulderstraps
that
i
am
a
surgeon
oh
i
do
not
mind
you
but
baxter
how
i
did
behave
before
him
what
must
he
have
thought
and
he
does
not
allow
women
to
come
here
well
you
passed
inspection
and
as
you
propose
to
stay
with
us
i
will
have
a
room
prepared
for
you
he
then
went
on
to
state
that
the
reason
doctor
baxter
would
not
have
female
nurses
was
that
he
would
not
submit
to
miss
dix
interference
did
not
like
the
women
she
chose
and
army
regulations
did
not
permit
him
to
employ
any
other
but
he
continued
no
one
can
object
to
his
entertaining
a
guest
and
as
his
guest
you
can
employ
your
time
as
you
wish
ah
what
a
glorious
boon
it
was
this
privilege
of
work
and
my
little
just
twice
the
width
of
my
iron
cot
i
would
not
have
exchanged
for
any
suite
in
windsor
palace
chapter
lv
find
a
name
nothing
was
more
needed
in
the
bad
ward
than
an
antidote
for
homesickness
and
to
furnish
this
i
used
my
talking
talent
to
the
utmost
but
no
subject
was
so
interesting
as
myself
i
was
the
mystery
of
the
hour
charlie
was
commissioned
to
make
discoveries
and
the
second
day
came
with
a
long
face
and
said
do
you
know
what
they
say
about
you
no
indeed
and
suspect
i
should
never
guess
well
they
say
you
an
old
maid
i
stopped
work
rose
from
my
knees
confronted
him
and
exclaimed
with
an
injured
air
an
old
maid
why
charlie
is
it
possible
you
let
them
talk
in
that
manner
about
me
after
the
nice
pickles
i
gave
you
the
pickles
had
made
him
sick
and
now
there
was
a
general
laugh
at
his
expense
but
he
stuck
to
his
purpose
and
said
well
ai
you
on
old
maid
an
old
maid
charlie
did
any
one
ever
see
such
a
saucy
boy
oh
but
tell
us
good
earnest
ai
you
an
old
maid
well
then
good
earnest
charlie
i
expect
i
shall
be
one
if
i
live
to
be
old
enough
live
to
be
old
enough
how
old
do
you
call
yourself
i
set
down
my
basin
counted
on
my
fingers
thought
it
over
and
replied
well
if
i
live
two
months
and
five
days
longer
i
shall
be
sixteen
then
there
was
a
shout
at
charlie
expense
and
i
resumed
my
work
grave
as
an
owl
that
furnished
amusement
until
it
grew
stale
when
charlie
came
to
ask
me
my
name
and
i
told
him
it
was
snooks
mrs
snooks
repeated
a
dozen
men
who
looked
sadly
disappointed
and
charlie
most
of
all
as
i
added
yes
timothy
snooks
of
snooksville
minnesota
this
was
worse
and
worse
it
was
evident
no
one
liked
the
name
but
all
save
one
were
too
polite
to
say
so
and
he
roared
out
i
do
believe
a
word
of
it
i
sat
at
some
distance
with
my
back
to
him
dressing
a
wound
and
without
turning
said
why
what
is
the
matter
with
you
i
do
believe
that
such
a
looking
woman
as
you
are
ever
married
a
fellow
by
the
name
of
snooks
that
is
because
you
are
not
acquainted
with
the
snooks
family
brother
peter
wife
is
a
much
better
looking
woman
than
i
am
good
lookin
he
sneered
call
yourself
good
lookin
do
you
well
i
think
you
intimated
as
much
did
he
not
boys
they
all
said
he
had
and
the
laugh
was
turned
on
him
but
he
exclaimed
doggedly
i
do
care
i
not
goin
to
call
you
snooks
and
what
do
you
propose
to
call
me
i
call
you
mary
but
mary
is
not
my
name
i
do
care
it
the
name
of
all
the
nice
girls
i
know
very
good
i
too
shall
probably
be
a
nice
girl
if
i
live
to
grow
up
but
just
now
it
seems
as
if
i
should
die
in
infancy
am
too
good
to
live
you
the
greatest
torment
ever
any
man
saw
the
last
pin
was
in
that
bandage
i
arose
turned
and
the
thought
flashed
through
my
brain
a
tiger
his
eyes
literally
blazed
and
i
went
to
him
looking
straight
into
them
just
as
i
had
done
into
more
than
once
a
minnie
rifle
ball
had
passed
through
his
right
ankle
and
when
i
saw
him
first
the
flesh
around
the
wound
was
purple
and
the
entire
limb
swollen
almost
to
bursting
the
ward
master
told
me
he
had
been
given
up
three
days
before
and
was
only
waiting
his
turn
to
be
carried
to
the
dead
house
next
morning
the
surgeon
confirmed
the
account
said
he
had
been
on
the
amputation
table
and
sent
away
in
hope
the
foot
might
be
saved
adding
i
think
we
were
influenced
by
the
splendor
of
the
man
form
it
seemed
sacrilege
to
mangle
such
a
leg
then
before
we
knew
it
was
too
late
i
thought
the
inflammation
might
be
removed
he
said
if
that
were
done
they
could
amputate
and
save
him
and
the
conversation
ended
in
the
surgeon
giving
the
man
to
me
to
experiment
on
my
theory
this
seemed
to
be
generally
known
and
the
case
was
watched
with
great
interest
no
one
interfered
with
my
treatment
of
him
and
nurses
designated
him
to
me
as
your
man
he
was
a
cross
between
a
hercules
and
apollo
the
finest
specimen
of
physical
manhood
i
have
ever
seen
and
now
his
frail
hold
on
life
was
endangered
by
the
rage
into
which
i
had
unwittingly
thrown
him
so
i
sat
bathing
and
soothing
him
looking
ever
and
anon
steadily
into
his
eyes
and
said
you
had
better
call
me
mother
mother
he
snarled
you
my
mother
why
not
why
you
not
old
enough
i
am
twice
as
old
as
you
are
no
you
not
and
another
thing
you
not
big
enough
he
raised
his
head
surveyed
me
leisurely
and
contemptuously
his
dark
silky
moustache
went
up
against
his
handsome
nose
as
he
sank
back
and
said
slowly
why
still
i
am
large
enough
to
take
care
of
you
and
send
you
back
to
your
regiment
if
you
are
reasonable
but
no
one
can
do
anything
for
you
if
you
fly
into
a
rage
in
this
way
yes
and
you
know
that
and
you
put
me
in
a
rage
going
after
them
other
fellows
you
know
i
got
the
best
right
to
you
i
claimed
you
soon
as
you
come
in
the
door
and
called
you
afore
you
got
half
down
the
ward
you
said
you
take
care
of
me
and
now
you
do
do
it
the
surgeon
give
me
to
you
too
you
know
i
ca
live
if
you
do
save
me
and
you
care
if
i
die
i
was
penitent
and
conciliatory
and
promised
to
be
good
when
he
said
doggedly
yes
and
i
call
you
mary
very
well
mary
is
a
good
name
it
was
my
mother
and
i
shall
no
doubt
come
to
like
it
i
guess
it
is
a
good
name
it
was
my
mother
name
too
and
any
woman
might
be
glad
to
be
called
mary
but
i
never
did
see
a
woman
had
any
sense
he
soon
growled
himself
to
sleep
and
from
that
time
i
called
him
ursa
major
but
he
only
slept
about
half
an
hour
when
a
nurse
in
great
fright
summoned
me
they
had
lifted
him
and
he
had
fainted
i
helped
to
put
him
back
into
bed
and
bathed
him
until
consciousness
returned
when
he
grasped
my
wrist
with
a
hold
and
groaned
oh
god
oh
mother
is
this
death
i
heard
no
more
of
miss
mary
or
nice
girls
but
god
and
mother
and
death
were
often
on
his
lips
to
the
great
surprise
of
every
one
i
quelled
the
inflammation
and
fever
banished
the
swelling
and
got
him
into
good
condition
when
the
foot
was
amputated
and
shown
to
me
the
ankle
joint
was
ground
into
small
pieces
and
these
were
mingled
with
bits
of
leather
and
woolen
sock
no
wonder
the
inflammation
had
been
frightful
but
it
was
some
time
after
that
before
i
knew
the
foot
might
have
been
saved
by
making
a
sufficient
opening
from
the
outside
withdrawing
the
loose
irritating
matter
and
keeping
an
opening
through
which
nature
could
have
disposed
of
her
waste
i
do
not
know
if
surgery
have
yet
discovered
this
plain
rule
but
tens
of
thousands
of
men
have
died
and
tens
of
thousands
of
others
have
lost
limbs
because
it
was
not
known
and
acted
upon
all
those
men
who
died
of
flesh
wounds
were
victims
to
surgical
stupidity
i
nursed
the
cross
man
until
he
went
about
on
crutches
and
his
faith
in
me
was
equal
in
perfection
to
his
form
for
he
always
held
that
i
could
stop
this
pain
if
i
would
and
rated
me
soundly
if
i
was
off
in
ward
ten
when
he
wanted
me
one
day
he
scolded
worse
than
usual
and
soon
after
an
irishman
said
in
an
aside
schure
mum
an
ye
must
be
afther
blamin
de
rist
av
us
fur
that
fellow
impidence
schure
an
there
some
av
us
that
kick
him
out
av
the
ward
if
we
could
for
the
way
he
talks
to
ye
afther
all
that
you
have
done
for
an
fur
all
av
us
why
why
how
can
you
feel
so
what
difference
is
it
to
me
how
he
talks
it
does
him
good
to
scold
and
what
is
the
use
of
a
man
having
a
mother
if
he
can
not
scold
her
when
he
is
in
pain
i
wish
you
would
all
scold
me
it
would
do
you
ever
so
much
good
you
quite
break
my
heart
with
your
patience
do
please
be
as
cross
as
bears
all
of
you
whenever
you
feel
like
it
and
i
will
get
you
well
in
half
the
time
schure
mum
an
nobody
iver
saw
the
likes
of
ye
a
man
was
brought
from
a
field
hospital
and
laid
in
our
ward
and
one
evening
his
stump
was
giving
him
great
pain
when
the
cross
man
advised
him
to
send
for
me
and
exclaimed
there
mother
now
send
for
her
oh
groaned
the
sufferer
what
can
she
do
i
do
know
what
she
can
do
an
she
do
know
what
she
can
do
but
just
you
send
for
her
she
come
and
go
to
fussin
an
hummin
about
just
like
an
old
an
furst

for
the
pain

asleep
chapter
lvi
drop
my
alias
the
second
or
third
day
of
my
hospital
work
gaylord
the
chaplain
wife
came
and
inquired
to
what
order
i
belonged
saying
that
the
officers
of
the
hospital
were
anxious
to
know
i
laughed
and
told
her
i
belonged
exclusively
to
myself
and
did
not
know
of
any
order
which
would
care
to
own
me
then
she
very
politely
inquired
my
name
and
i
told
her
it
was
jeremiah
snooks
when
she
went
away
apparently
doubting
my
statement
i
had
been
in
campbell
almost
a
week
when
kelly
came
and
said
madam
i
have
been
commissioned
by
the
officers
of
this
hospital
to
ascertain
your
name
none
of
us
know
how
to
address
you
and
it
is
very
awkward
either
in
speaking
to
you
or
of
you
not
to
be
able
to
name
you
doctor
will
not
snooks
do
for
a
name
for
all
the
time
i
shall
be
here
no
madam
it
will
not
do
i
was
very
unwilling
to
give
my
name
which
was
prominently
before
the
public
on
account
of
my
indian
lecture
and
letters
but
i
seemed
to
have
at
least
a
month
work
to
do
in
campbell
hospital
stores
were
pouring
in
to
my
city
address
and
being
sent
to
me
at
a
rate
which
created
much
wonder
and
the
men
who
had
given
me
their
confidence
had
a
right
to
know
who
i
was
so
i
gave
my
name
and
must
repeat
it
before
the
doctor
could
realize
the
astounding
fact
even
then
he
took
off
his
cap
and
said
it
is
not
possible
you
are
the
lady
who
lectured
in
doctor
sunderland
church
so
i
was
proclaimed
with
a
great
flourish
of
trumpets
for
two
hours
my
patients
seemed
afraid
of
me
and
it
did
seem
too
bad
to
merge
that
giantess
of
the
and
the
press
and
the
tall
woman
of
the
platform
both
in
poor
little
insignificant
me
it
was
like
blotting
out
the
big
bear
and
the
bear
from
the
old
bear
story
and
leaving
only
the
one
poor
little
bear
to
growl
over
his
pot
of
porridge
in
ward
five
was
one
man
who
had
been
laid
on
his
left
side
and
never
could
be
moved
while
he
lived
his
right
arm
suffered
for
lack
of
support
and
when
i
knelt
to
give
him
nourishment
from
a
spoon
and
pray
with
him
that
the
deliverer
would
soon
come
he
always
laid
that
arm
over
my
shoulders
the
first
time
i
knelt
there
after
i
was
known
he
said
ah
you
are
such
a
great
lady
and
do
not
mind
a
poor
soldier
laying
his
arm
over
you
christ
the
great
captain
of
our
salvation
i
replied
gathers
you
in
his
arms
and
pillows
your
head
upon
his
bosom
am
i
greater
than
he
your
good
right
arm
has
fought
for
liberty
and
it
is
an
honor
to
support
it
when
you
are
no
longer
able
but
nothing
else
i
could
ever
say
to
him
was
so
much
comfort
as
the
old
cry
of
the
sufferer
by
the
wayside
jesus
thou
son
of
david
have
mercy
on
me
over
and
over
again
we
said
that
prayer
in
concert
while
he
waited
in
agony
for
the
only
relief
possible
that
of
death
and
from
our
last
interview
i
returned
to
the
bad
ward
so
sad
that
i
felt
the
shadow
of
my
face
fall
upon
every
man
in
it
i
could
not
drive
away
death
gloom
but
i
could
work
and
talk
and
both
work
and
talk
were
needed
i
sat
down
between
two
young
irishmen
both
with
wounded
heads
and
began
to
bathe
them
and
comfort
them
and
said
if
you
are
not
better
in
the
morning
i
shall
amputate
both
those
heads
they
shall
not
plague
you
in
this
manner
another
day
maybe
my
sad
face
made
this
funny
for
their
sense
of
the
ridiculous
was
so
touched
that
they
clasped
their
sore
heads
and
shrieked
with
laughter
every
man
in
the
ward
caught
the
infection
and
i
was
called
upon
for
explanations
of
the
art
of
amputating
heads
and
inquiries
as
to
surgeon
baxter
capacity
of
performing
the
operation
this
grotesque
idea
proved
a
fruitful
subject
of
conversation
and
aided
in
leading
sufferers
away
from
useless
sorrow
toward
hope
and
health
and
bad
as
the
ward
was
we
lost
but
two
men
in
it
chapter
lvii
hospital
dress
in
that
sad
ward
one
superior
intelligent
young
man
who
was
thought
to
be
doing
well
suddenly
burst
an
artery
and
ropes
were
put
up
to
warn
visitors
and
others
not
to
come
in
and
we
who
were
in
moved
with
bated
breath
lest
some
motion
should
start
the
while
his
last
hope
was
on
a
stillness
which
forbade
him
to
move
a
finger
two
lady
visitors
came
to
the
door
were
forbidden
to
enter
but
seeing
me
inside
must
follow
the
sheep
instinct
of
the
sex
and
go
where
any
other
woman
had
gone
so
with
pert
words
they
forced
their
way
in
made
a
general
flutter
and
oh
horror
one
of
them
caught
her
hoops
on
the
iron
cot
of
the
dying
man
he
was
only
saved
from
a
severe
jerk
by
the
prompt
intervention
of
the
special
nurse
they
were
led
out
as
quietly
as
possible
but
the
man
had
received
a
slight
jerk
and
a
serious
shock
the
hemorrhage
would
probably
have
returned
if
they
had
not
come
in
but
it
did
return
and
the
young
strong
life
ebbed
steadily
away
in
a
crimson
current
which
spread
over
the
floor
from
that
day
until
the
end
of
my
hospital
work
one
fact
forced
itself
upon
my
attention
and
this
is
that
with
all
the
patriotism
of
the
american
women
during
that
war
and
all
their
gush
of
sympathy
for
the
soldier
a
vast
majority
were
much
more
willing
to
kiss
him
for
his
mother
than
render
him
any
solid
service
and
that
not
one
in
a
hundred
of
the
women
who
succeeded
in
getting
into
hospitals
would
dress
so
as
not
to
be
an
object
of
terror
to
men
whose
life
depended
on
quiet
women
were
capable
of
any
heroism
save
wearing
a
dress
suitable
for
hospital
work
the
very
very
few
who
laid
aside
their
hoops
those
instruments
of
dread
and
torture
generally
donned
bloomers
and
gave
offense
by
airs
of
independence
good
women
would
come
long
distances
to
see
dying
husbands
brothers
and
sons
and
fill
the
wards
with
alarm
by
their
hoops
when
any
one
was
hurt
by
them
they
were
very
sorry
but
never
gave
up
the
cause
of
offense
while
their
desire
to
look
well
and
the
finery
and
fixings
they
donned
to
improve
their
appearance
was
a
very
broad
and
painful
burlesque
women
were
seldom
permitted
to
stay
in
a
hospital
over
night
even
with
a
dying
friend
and
the
inhabitants
were
generally
glad
when
they
started
for
home
it
was
the
dress
nuisance
which
caused
nuns
to
have
the
preference
in
so
many
cases
but
i
could
not
see
or
hear
that
they
ever
did
anything
but
make
converts
to
the
church
and
take
care
of
clothing
and
jellies
one
thing
is
certain
that
women
never
can
do
efficient
and
general
service
in
hospitals
until
their
dress
is
prescribed
by
laws
inexorable
as
those
of
the
medes
and
persians
then
that
dress
should
be
entirely
destitute
of
steel
starch
flounces
and
ornaments
of
all
descriptions
should
rest
on
the
shoulders
have
a
skirt
from
the
waist
to
the
ankle
and
a
waist
which
leaves
room
for
breathing
i
never
could
have
done
my
hospital
work
but
for
the
dress
which
led
most
people
to
mistake
me
for
a
nun
chapter
lviii
special
work
in
the
wilderness
of
work
i
must
choose
and
began
to
select
men
who
had
been
given
up
by
the
surgeons
and
whom
i
thought
might
be
saved
by
special
care
surgeon
kelly
soon
entered
into
my
plan
and
made
his
ward
my
headquarters
to
it
my
special
patients
were
brought
until
there
was
no
more
room
for
them
that
intuitive
perception
of
the
natural
position
of
muscles
and
the
importance
of
keeping
them
in
it
which
came
to
me
on
first
seeing
a
wound
dressed
gave
me
such
control
over
pain
that
i
used
to
go
through
the
wards
between
midnight
and
morning
and
put
amputation
cases
to
sleep
at
the
rate
of
one
in
fifteen
minutes
in
these
morning
walks
i
saw
that
the
nurses
were
on
duty
and
had
substantial
refreshments
saw
those
changes
for
the
worse
sure
to
come
if
they
came
at
all
in
those
chill
hours
seeing
them
soon
was
important
to
meeting
them
successfully
and
i
succeeded
in
breaking
up
many
a
chill
before
it
did
serious
damage
which
must
have
proved
fatal
if
left
until
the
morning
visit
of
the
surgeon
also
in
those
walks
i
chose
special
cases
have
more
than
once
sat
down
by
a
man
and
calculated
in
this
way
you
may
have
twenty
forty
years
of
useful
life
if
i
can
save
you
i
shall
certainly
die
one
year
sooner
for
the
labor
i
expend
on
you
but
there
will
be
a
large
gain
in
the
average
of
life
and
usefulness
and
when
you
risked
all
of
your
life
for
the
country
as
much
mine
as
yours
it
is
but
just
that
i
should
give
a
small
part
of
mine
to
save
you
every
man
lived
whom
i
elected
to
life
and
kelly
who
knew
more
than
any
one
else
about
my
plans
and
on
whom
i
most
counted
for
aid
has
said
that
i
saved
enough
to
the
government
in
bounty
money
by
returning
men
to
duty
who
would
otherwise
have
died
to
warrant
it
in
supporting
me
the
balance
of
my
life
but
his
statements
could
not
always
be
relied
upon
for
he
insisted
that
i
never
slept
had
not
been
asleep
during
the
seven
weeks
spent
in
campbell
was
a
witch
and
would
float
like
a
cork
if
thrown
from
the
long
bridge
into
the
potomac
in
selecting
a
man
in
desperate
case
to
be
saved
i
always
took
his
temperament
and
previous
life
into
consideration
a
man
of
pure
life
and
sanguine
temperament
was
hard
to
kill
give
him
the
excuse
of
good
nursing
and
he
would
live
through
injuries
which
must
be
fatal
to
a
bilious
suspicious
man
or
one
who
had
been
guilty
of
any
excess
a
tobacco
chewer
or
smoker
died
on
small
provocation
a
drunkard
or
debauchee
was
killed
by
a
scratch
there
were
two
ward
surgeons
who
disapproved
of
the
innovation
of
a
woman
in
campbell
and
especially
of
one
held
amenable
to
no
rules
they
were
both
in
favor
of
heroic
treatment
which
i
did
not
care
to
witness
and
i
spent
little
time
in
their
wards
one
of
them
kept
a
man
with
two
bricks
tied
to
his
foot
and
hanging
over
the
foot
of
the
bed
until
he
died
after
ten
days
of
a
sleepless
agony
such
as
could
not
well
have
been
excelled
in
an
inquisition
while
his
wife
tried
to
comfort
him
under
a
torture
she
begged
in
vain
to
have
remitted
the
night
after
she
started
home
with
his
body
i
was
passing
through
the
ward
when
i
came
upon
a
young
philadelphia
zouave
in
a
perfect
paroxysm
of
anguish
three
nurses
stood
around
him
and
to
my
inquiry
what
the
matter
replied
by
dumb
show
that
coming
death
was
the
matter
and
that
soon
all
would
be
over
while
in
words
they
told
me
he
had
not
slept
for
hours
i
had
one
place
a
chair
for
me
sat
down
and
with
my
long
thin
hands
grasped
the
thigh
stump
which
was
making
all
the
trouble
drew
and
pressed
the
muscle
into
a
natural
easy
position
cooed
and
talked
and
comforted
the
sufferer
as
i
should
have
done
a
sick
baby
and
in
ten
minutes
he
was
asleep
then
i
whispered
the
nurses
to
bring
cotton
and
oakum
and
little
cushions
made
them
put
the
cotton
and
oakum
in
small
tufts
to
my
index
fingers
and
while
i
crooned
my
directions
in
a
lullaby
air
i
worked
in
this
support
gradually
and
imperceptibly
withdrawing
my
hands
until
i
could
substitute
the
little
cushions
for
the
force
by
which
they
held
the
muscle
in
proper
position
this
done
my
slept
as
sweetly
as
ever
he
had
done
in
his
crib
next
morning
a
nurse
came
running
for
me
to
hurry
to
him
he
had
slept
six
hours
waked
had
his
breakfast
and
had
his
wound
dressed
and
now
the
pain
was
back
bad
as
ever
i
went
fixed
the
mangled
muscle
with
reference
to
his
change
of
position
made
a
to
hold
it
there
and
before
i
had
finished
he
began
an
sleep
ten
days
after
he
was
sent
home
to
his
mother
and
i
saw
or
heard
of
him
no
more
chapter
lix
heroic
and
treatment
the
other
ward
in
which
i
was
not
welcome
adjoined
that
one
in
which
my
room
was
situated
and
to
reach
it
i
must
go
out
of
doors
or
pass
through
the
length
of
that
ward
in
these
passages
i
had
an
opportunity
for
studying
piemia
and
its
ordinary
treatment
and
could
give
the
men
lemonade
when
they
wanted
it
in
this
ward
lay
a
young
german
with
a
wounded
ankle
he
had
a
broad
square
forehead
skin
white
as
wax
large
blue
eyes
and
yellow
hair
inclined
to
curl
his
whole
appearance
indicated
high
culture
and
an
organization
peculiarly
sensitive
to
pleasure
or
pain
but
no
one
seemed
to
understand
that
he
suffered
more
than
others
from
a
like
cause
surgeon
and
nurses
scoffed
at
his
moans
and
thought
it
babyish
for
a
muscular
man
over
six
feet
to
show
so
many
signs
of
pain
i
think
that
from
some
cause
the
surgeon
felt
vindictive
toward
him
and
that
his
subordinates
took
their
cue
from
him
when
i
went
to
give
him
lemonade
he
would
clutch
my
hand
or
dress
look
up
in
my
face
and
plead
oh
mutter
mutter
but
if
i
sat
down
to
soothe
and
comfort
him
a
nurse
always
came
to
remind
me
of
the
surgeon
orders
and
i
used
to
go
around
on
the
outside
that
he
might
not
see
and
call
me
when
he
was
in
the
amputation
room
i
heard
his
shrieks
and
groans
and
carried
a
glass
of
wine
to
the
door
for
him
he
heard
my
voice
and
called
mutter
mutter
i
pushed
past
the
orderly
ran
to
him
and
his
pleading
eyes
seemed
to
devour
me
as
he
fastened
his
gaze
on
my
face
i
can
not
think
to
this
day
why
be
should
have
been
nude
for
the
amputation
of
a
foot
but
he
was
and
some
one
threw
a
towel
across
his
loins
as
i
approached
baxter
said
no
sympathy
no
sympathy
so
i
stood
by
him
placed
a
hand
on
each
side
of
his
corrugated
brow
steadied
my
voice
and
said
be
a
man
and
a
soldier
he
had
asked
me
for
bread
i
gave
him
a
stone
and
no
wonder
he
dashed
it
back
in
my
face
with
a
fierce
cry
he
said
i
hev
been
a
man
and
a
sojer
long
enough
ah
verily
had
he
and
much
too
long
days
before
that
he
should
have
been
a
boy
again
aye
a
baby
a
very
infant
should
have
been
soothed
and
softened
and
comforted
with
all
the
tenderness
of
but
even
now
in
this
cruel
extremity
every
sign
of
sympathy
was
denied
him
some
one
put
a
hand
gently
but
firmly
on
each
of
my
shoulders
turned
my
back
to
him
took
me
out
of
the
room
and
i
hurried
away
while
the
air
shuddered
with
his
shrieks
and
groans
after
he
had
been
brought
back
to
his
place
in
the
ward
i
could
often
hear
him
as
i
passed
to
and
from
my
room
and
even
while
i
occupied
it
once
he
saw
me
through
the
open
door
and
called
mutter
mutter
i
went
knelt
by
him
took
his
hands
which
were
stretched
appealingly
to
me
and
spoke
comforting
words
while
his
blue
eyes
seemed
ready
to
start
from
their
sockets
as
he
clung
to
my
hands
with
the
old
familiar
cry
oh
mutter
mutter
he
was
strapped
down
to
his
iron
cot
about
as
closely
as
he
had
been
to
the
amputation
table
and
the
cot
fastened
to
the
floor
i
had
not
been
five
minutes
at
his
side
when
his
special
nurse
hurried
up
and
warned
me
to
leave
saying
it
surgeon
orders
he
not
going
to
have
any
babyin
i
drew
my
hands
from
the
frantic
grasp
took
away
that
last
hold
on
human
sympathy
and
hurried
oat
while
his
cry
of
oh
mutter
mutter
rung
in
my
ears
as
i
turned
and
looked
on
his
pure
high
brow
for
the
last
time
next
morning
i
heard
he
had
and
that
the
surgeon
was
to
leave
the
night
after
that
victim
of
some
frightful
fiendish
experiment
had
been
carried
to
the
i
was
passing
through
the
ward
when
attracted
by
sounds
of
convulsive
weeping
and
i
found
a
young
man
in
an
agony
of
grief
in
one
of
those
sobbing
fits
sure
to
come
to
the
bravest
he
was
in
a
high
fever
and
while
i
bathed
his
face
and
hands
i
asked
the
cause
of
his
outbreak
and
he
sobbed
oh
the
pain
in
my
wound
this
is
the
third
night
i
have
not
slept
and
my
god
i
can
bear
it
no
longer
it
was
a
in
the
thigh
such
an
one
as
usually
proved
fatal
and
while
i
set
him
to
talking
i
began
patching
scraps
of
observation
into
a
theory
he
was
from
pennsylvania
and
bitterly
charged
his
state
with
having
done
nothing
for
her
wounded
and
when
i
asked
why
he
had
not
sent
for
me
he
said
oh
i
thought
you
were
from
massachusetts
like
all
the
rest
of
them
and
if
my
own
state
would
do
nothing
for
me
i
would
not
beg
people
come
here
every
day
looking
for
massachusetts
soldiers
since
i
have
been
frantic
here
ladies
have
come
and
stood
and
looked
at
me
and
said
fellow
as
if
i
had
been
a
dog
i
was
as
well
raised
as
any
of
them
even
if
i
am
a
common
soldier
i
thought
his
recovery
very
doubtful
and
talked
to
draw
his
thoughts
to
the
better
land
to
his
charges
against
his
native
land
i
said
i
am
a
pennsylvanian
and
more
than
that
the
governor
of
pennsylvania
sent
me
to
you
bade
me
come
that
you
might
know
he
had
not
forgotten
you
he
did
why
how
did
he
know
anything
about
it
he
just
knows
all
about
it
and
has
been
caring
for
you
all
this
time
i
do
not
mean
andy
curtin
he
is
nothing
but
a
subaltern
but
the
dear
lord
our
father
in
heaven
who
never
forgets
us
though
he
often
afflicts
us
he
sent
me
to
you
now
that
you
might
know
he
loves
you
it
was
he
who
made
me
love
you
and
care
to
help
you
all
the
love
and
care
that
come
to
you
are
a
part
of
his
love
he
wept
afresh
but
less
bitterly
and
said
oh
you
will
think
i
am
a
baby
well
that
is
just
what
you
ought
to
be
your
past
life
is
sufficient
certificate
of
manhood
and
now
has
come
your
time
to
be
a
baby
while
i
am
mother
you
have
been
lying
here
like
an
engine
under
a
high
pressure
of
steam
and
the
fastened
down
with
a

your
manhood
and
pride
and
let
out
all
the
groans
and
tears
you
have
pent
in
your
heart
cry
all
you
can
this
is
your
time
for
crying
when
i
had
talked
him
into
a
mood
to
let
me
feel
if
his
feet
were
warm
i
found
that
wounded
limb
dreadfully
swollen
cold
almost
as
death
stretched
out
as
he
lay
on
his
back
and
a
cushion
right
under
the
heel
had
there
been
no
wound
the
position
must
have
been
unendurable
without
letting
him
know
i
drew
that
cushion
up
until
it
filled
the
hollow
between
the
heel
and
calf
of
the
leg
and
supported
the
strained

the

rolled
it

which
i
had

and
put

on
it
arranged
the

that

told
him
to
get
the

surgeon
next
morning
to
make
a
large
opening
on
the
lower
side
of
his
thigh
where
the
bullet
had
gone
out
to
ask
him
to
cut
lengthwise
of
the
muscle
get
out
everything
he
could
that
ought
not
to
be
in
there
keep
that
opening
open
with
a
roll
of
bandage
so
that
old
mother
nature
should
have
a
through
which
she
could
throw
her
chips
out
of
that
in
his
thigh
to
be
sure
and
not
hint
to
the
surgeon
that
i
had
said
anything
about
it
and
not
fail
to
have
it
done
i
left
him
asleep
and
the
next
day
he
told
me
the
surgeon
had
taken
a
quart
of
pus
and
several
pieces
of
woolen
cloth
out
of
his
wound
and
his
recovery
was
rapid
chapter
lx
cost
of
order
in
making
molds
and
rests
for
mangled
limbs
i
had
large
demands
for
little
cushions
and
without
economy
could
not
get
enough
when
one
just
fitted
a
place
i
wanted
to
keep
it
and
to
do
this
must
have
it
aired
perhaps
washed
to
avoid
lint
dressings
i
hunted
pieces
of
soft
table
linen
gave
to
patients
pieces
to
suit
and
as
the
supply
was
short
they
would
get
nurses
and
surgeons
to
leave
their
pieces
of
linen
after
dressing
their
wounds
until
i
should
take
charge
and
have
them
cleansed
for
next

to
do
all
this
i
must
use
the

for
airing
and
drying
cushions
and
rags
these
plats
and
railings
were
for
ornament
and
there
was
soon
a
protest
against
putting
them
to
such
vile
uses
i
had
gone
into
the
hospital
with
the
stupid
notion
that
its
primary
object
was
the
care
and
comfort
of
the
sick
and
wounded
it
was
long
after
that
i
learned
that
a
vast
majority
of
all
benevolent
institutions
are
gotten
up
to
gratify
the
asthetic
tastes
of
the
public
exhibit
the
wealth
and
generosity
of
the
founders
and
furnish
places
for
officers
the
beneficiaries
of
the
institutions
are
simply
an
apology
for
their

and
having
furnished
that
apology
the

about
them
the

the
surgeons
of
campbell
did
really
want
its
patients
to
be
happy
and
get
well
but
it
was
a
model
institution
with
a
reputation
to
sustain
was
part
of
a
system
under
general
laws
which
might
not
be
broken
with
impunity
there
was
no
law
against
a
man
dying
for
want
of
sleep
from
pain
caused
by
misplaced
muscle
but
the
statutes
against
litter
were
inexorable
as
those
of
the
medes
and

the
campbell
surgeons
winked
at
my
litter
until
one
regular
inspection
day
when
my

and

clean
and
unclean
those
marked
john

and
those
labeled
tom

were
all
huddled
up
and
stuffed
into
the

i
used
to
wonder
if
the
creator
had
invented
a
new
variety
of
idiot
and
made
a
lot
in
order
to
supply
the
army
with
medical
inspectors
or
if
by
some
cunning
military
device
the
had
been
able
to
select
all
those
conglomerations
of
official
dignity
and
asinine
stupidity
from
the
open
of
the
world
inspecting
a
hospital
was
just
like
investigating
an
indian
fraud
the
man
whose
work
was
to
be
inspected
or
investigated
met
the
inspector
or
investigator
at
the
door
showed
him
all
he
wished
him
to
see
and
examine
witnesses
wholly
in
his
power
when
the
inspected
and
inspector
the
investigated
and
investigator
exchanged
compliments
and
the
public
were
gratified
to
learn
that
all
was
in
a
most
gratifying
condition
of
perfect
order
one
day
we
had
a
particularly
searching
inspection
and
next
day
nurse
told
me
of
some
four
new
cases
which
had
been
brought
in
a
week
before
one
of
whom
the
inspectors
said
was
past
hope
i
found
his
feet
and
legs
with
a
crust
on
them
like
the
shell
of
a
snail
had
a
piece
of
rubber
cloth
laid
under
them
and
with
tepid
water
a
good
crash
towel
and
plenty
of
rubbing
got
down
to
the
skin
which
i
rubbed
well
with
lard
then
with
fresh
towels
and
water
at
hand
i
drew
away
the
sheet
in
which
the
patient
had
rolled
his
head
and
while
i
washed
his
head
and
arms
and
breast
i
talked
and
he
tried
to
answer
but
it
was
some
time
before
he
could
steady
his
tongue
and
lips
so
as
to
articulate
and
when
he
did
his
first
words
were
are
you
the
woman
that
been
my
feet
that
is
exactly
what
i
have
been
doing
and
much
need
they
had
of
it
do
you
not
think
you
are
a
pretty
fellow
to
have
me
come
all
the
way
from
minnesota
to
wash
your
feet
it
was
with
much
effort
he
could
fix
his
dazed
eyes
on
my
face
and
he
made
several
pitiful
attempts
before
he
succeeded
in
saying
i
think
the
best
woman
that
ever
i
saw
ah
that
is
because
you
never
saw
much
away
out
there
in
venango
county
pennsylvania
where
you
live
there
are
thousands
of
better
women
than
i
running
around
hunting
work
in
this
part
of
the
country
is
there
yes
indeed
and
nothing
for
them
to
do
i
never
saw
none
uv
that
is
because
you
have
had
your
head
rolled
up
in
that
sheet
just
keep
your
head
uncovered
so
you
can
breathe
this
nice
fresh
air
open
your
eyes
every
little
while
and
you
will
see
a
whole
row
of
those
women
all
hunting
work
he
seemed
quite
interested
and
when
i
had
done
washing
and
given
directions
to
a
nurse
to
cleanse
the
balance
of
his
person
i
asked
if
there
was
anything
more
i
could
do
for
him
when
he
stammered
not
unless
you
could
get
me
a
cup
of
tea
a
cup
of
good
green
tea
any
milk
or
sugar
in
it
if
you
do
i
pay
you
for
it
pay
me
for
it
will
you
and
how
much
will
you
give
me
three
cents
oh
i
give
you
cents
cents
for
a
cup
of
good
green
tea
without
any
milk
or
sugar
in
it
i
called
the
ward
to
witness
the
bargain
said
i
should
grow
rich
at
that
rate
and
hurried
off
for
the
tea
i
had
a
little
silver
tray
and
with
two
china
cups
gangewer
of
the
ohio
aid
society
had
sent
me
a
tin
and
folks
at
a
distance
had
sent
plenty
of
the
best
tea
and
that
little
had
become
a
prominent
feature
of
campbell
long
before
this
poor
fellow
specified
his
want
i
made
the
tray
unusually
attractive
that
day
and
fed
him
his
tea
from
a
spoon
while
he
admired
the
tiny
pot
out
of
which
with
the
aid
of
the
kettle
i
could
furnish
twenty
cups
of
good
tea
when
i
had
served
all
in
that
ward
who
wanted
tea
the
first
one
took
a
second
cup
and
while
taking
it
his
skin
grew
moist
and
i
knew
he
was
saved
from
that
death
of
misplaced
matter
vulgarly
called
dirt
to
which
medical
inspectors
had
consigned
him
while
giving
their
invaluable
scientific
attention
to
and
to
whitewashing
and
i
doubt
if
there
were
a
medical
inspector
in
the
army
who
was
not
a
first
rate
judge
of
the
art
of
folding
and
ironing
a
sheet
or
of
the
particular
tuck
which
brought
out
the
outlines
of
the
corners
of
a
mattress
as
seen
through
a
counterpane
and
of
the
art
and
mystery
of
cleaning
a
floor
it
did
seem
as
if
they
had
all
reached
office
through
their
great
proficiency
as
next
day
i
went
to
that
ward
with
my
and
after
learning
that
that
man
had
been
washed
once
more
asked
him
if
he
wanted
another
cup
of
tea
i
like
to
have
one
he
stammered
but
i
did
pay
you
for
the
last
one
and
i
ca
find
my
wallet
i
saw
the
debt
troubled
him
and
took
this
as
one
more
evidence
that
somewhere
there
were
people
who
sold
hospital
stores
to
sick
soldiers
so
i
took
pains
to
explain
that
he
owed
me
nothing
that
the
tea
was
his
ladies
had
sent
it
to
me
to
give
to
him
and
all
the
pay
they
wanted
was
for
him
to
get
well
and
go
home
to
his
mother
the
idea
that
some
one
was
thinking
for
him
seemed
to
do
him
almost
as
much
good
as
the
tea
i
left
campbell
next
day
but
on
my
first
visit
found
him
convalescing
and
on
the
second
visit
he
ran
down
the
ward
holding
his
sides
and
laughing
and
i
saw
or
heard
of
him
no
more

learn
to
control
piemia
about
ten
days
after
i
went
to
campbell
i
was
called
at
midnight
to
a
it
was
a
case
of
in
the
thigh
and
the
whole
limb
was
swollen
almost
to
bursting
so
cold
as
to
startle
by
the
touch
and
almost
as
transparent
as
glass
i
knew
this
was
piemia
and
that
for
it
medical
science
had
no
cure
but
i
wanted
to
warm
that
cold
limb
to
call
circulation
back
to
that
inert
mass
the
first
thought
was
warm
wet
compresses
hot
bricks
hot
flannel
but
the
kitchen
was
locked
and
it
was
little
i
could
do
without
fire
except
to
receive
and
write
down
his
dying
messages
to
parents
and
the
girl
who
was
waiting
to
be
his
wife
when
the
surgeon
morning
hour
came
he
still
lived
and
at
my
suggestion
the
warm
compresses
were
applied
he
said
they
feel
so
good
and
was
quite
comforted
by
them
but
died
about
ten
i
was
greatly
grieved
to
think
he
had
suffered
from
cold
the
last
night
of
life
but
how
avoid
any
number
of
similar
occurrences
there
was
no
artificial
heat
in
any
of
the
wards
a
basin
of
warm
water
was
only
to
be
obtained
by
special
favor
of
the
cooks
but
they
had
been
very
courteous
the
third
day
of
my
appearance
among
them
one
looked
up
over
the
edge
of
the
tub
over
which
he
bent
washing
potatoes
and
said
as
i
stood
waiting
for
hot
water
do
you
know
what
you
look
like
going
around
here
among
us
fellows
no
but
nothing
dreadful
i
hope
you
just
look
like
an
angel
and
that
what
we
all
think
we
ever
so
much
better
since
you
came
the
memory
of
this
speech
gave
me
courage
to
go
and
lay
my
trouble
before
the
cooks
who
gathered
to
hear
me
tell
the
story
of
that
death
the
messages
left
for
the
friends
who
should
see
him
no
more
and
of
my
sorrow
that
i
could
not
drive
away
the
cold
on
that
last
sad
night
they
all
wiped
their
eyes
on
their
aprons
head
cook
went
to
a
cupboard
brought
a
key
and
handed
it
to
me
saying
there
mother
is
a
key
of
this
kitchen
come
in
here
whenever
you
please
we
will
always
find
room
on
the
ranges
for
your
bricks
and
have
something
nice
in
the
cupboard
every
night
for
you
and
the
nurses
this
proved
to
be
the
key
to
the
situation
and
after
i
received
that
bit
of
metal
from
cook
there
was
not
one
death
from
piemia
in
any
ward
where
i
was
free
to
work
although
i
have
had
as
many
i
think
as
sixty
men
struck
with
the
premonitary
chill
in
one
night
i
concluded
that
piemia
was
french
for
neglect
and
that
the
antidote
was
warmth
nourishing
food
stimulants
friction
fresh
air
and
cheerfulness
and
did
not
hesitate
to
say
that
if
death
wanted
to
get
a
man
out
of
my
hands
he
must
send
some
other
agent
than
piemia
i
do
not
believe
in
the
medical
theory
concerning
it
do
not
believe
pus
ever
gets
into
the
veins
or
that
there
is
any
poison
about
it
except
that
of
ignorance
and
indifference
on
the
part
of
doctors
and
nurses
chapter
lxii
first
case
of
growing
a
new
bone
i
had
searched
for
minnesota
men
in
campbell
found
none
and
had
been
there
a
week
when
kelsey
told
me
there
was
one
in
ward
ten
credited
to
a
wisconsin
regiment
and
from
him
i
learned
that
he
was
a
friend
and
neighbor
of
my
friends
and
bancroft
of
mantorville
and
my
conscience
reproached
me
for
not
sooner
finding
him
but
the
second
day
gaylord
came
as
a
messenger
from
the
surgeons
to
tell
me
i
need
not
spend
time
and
strength
on
him
as
he
could
not
be
saved
his
was
a
thigh
wound
they
had
thought
to
amputate
but
found
the
bone
shattered
from
joint
to
joint
had
with
a
chain
saw
cut
it
off
above
the
knee
and
picked
out
the
bone
in
pieces
there
was
a
splinter
attached
to
the
upper
joint
but
that
was
all
the
bone
left
in
the
thigh
and
the
injury
was
one
from
which
recovery
was
impossible
his
father
a
doctor
was
visiting
him
and
knew
he
must
die
i
went
to
the
patient
who
said
dr
true
the
ward
surgeon
has
just
been
here
and
tells
me
i
must
die
i
sat
by
him
fitting
the
measure
i
had
been
taking
for
two
days
to
this
new
aspect
of
the
case
and
talking
of
death
and
the
preparation
for
it
until
i
thought
i
understood
the
case
when
i
said
be
ready
for
death
as
every
one
of
any
sense
should
always
be
but
i
do
not
intend
to
let
you
die
i
guess
you
can
not
help
it
all
the
surgeons
and
father
agree
that
there
is
no
hope
for
me
but
they
are
all
liable
to
be
mistaken
and
none
of
them
have
taken
into
the
account
your
courage
and
recuperative
force
your
good
life
and
good
conscience
your
muscle
like
a
pine
log
your
pure
breath
your
clear
skin
and
good
blood
i
do
not
care
what
they
say
you
will
live
i
will
not
let
you
die
i
found
baxter
and
said
i
want
you
to
save
corporal
kendall
corporal
kendall
who
is
he
the
man
out
of
whose
thigh
you
took
the
bone
last
week
his
face
grew
sad
but
he
said
oh
we
mean
to
save
them
all
if
we
can
doctor
that
is
no
answer
i
am
interested
in
this
man
know
his
friends
and
want
to
understand
his
case
if
i
can
keep
his
stomach
in
good
working
order
and
well
supplied
with
food
keep
away
chills
and
keep
down
pain
so
that
he
can
sleep
will
he
not
get
well
he
laughed
and
replied
well
i
really
never
heard
of
a
man
dying
under
such
circumstances
i
can
do
that
doctor
if
you
can
you
will
save
him
of
course
and
we
will
give
him
to
you
but
doctor
you
must
do
all
the
surgery
i
must
not
give
him
pain
can
not
see
that
wound
oh
certainly
we
will
do
everything
in
our
power
but
he
is
yours
for
we
have
no
hope
of
saving
him
another
thing
doctor
you
will
have
him
brought
to
ward
four
he
gave
the
order
at
once
adding
put
him
to
the
right
of
howard
a
young
philadelphian
with
a
thigh
stump
who
was
likely
to
die
of
hemorrhage
and
whose
jerking
nerves
i
could
soothe
and
quiet
better
than
any
one
else
by
this
arrangement
the
man
minus
a
thigh
bone
was
placed
in
the
center
of
my
field
of
labor
and
under
the
care
of
kelly
but
full
ten
days
after
this
arrangement
was
made
he
came
with
a
rueful
face
and
said
we
have
consulted
the
medical
inspector
and
a
dozen
other
surgeons
outside
the
hospital
and
they
all
agree
that
there
is
no
hope
for
kendall
the
surgeons
here
have
commissioned
me
to
tell
you
for
we
think
you
ought
to
know
we
all
appreciate
what
you
are
doing
and
think
you
will
save
all
your
other
men
if
you
live
but
you
can
not
stand
this
strain
long
you
do
not
know
it
but
there
is
a
limit
to
your
powers
of
endurance
and
you
are
breaking
you
certainly
will
die
if
you
keep
on
as
you
have
been
going
and
it
is
not
worth
your
while
to
kill
yourself
for
kendall
for
you
can
not
save
him
what
is
the
reason
he
can
not
be
saved
well
there
are
several
reasons
first
i
performed
the
operation
and
did
not
do
it
as
thoroughly
as
i
wished
he
was
coming
out
from
under
the
influence
of
the
chloroform
and
they
hurried
me
the
case
was
hopeless
and
no
use
to
give
him
pain
so
there
are
several
pieces
of
bone
which
i
failed
to
find
these
are
driven
into
the
flesh
and
nature
in
trying
to
get
rid
of
them
will
get
up
such
excessive
suppuration
that
he
must
die
of
exhaustion
then
there
is
the
thigh
without
a
bone
and
there
is
nothing
in
the
books
to
warrant
a
hope
that
it
could
heal
in
that
condition
we
could
not
in
any
case
hope
for
the
formation
of
a
new
bone
there
are
of
two
inches
but
this
is
the
longest
new
formation
of
which
we
know
anything
and
in
this
case
there
can
be
no
hope
because
the
periosteum
is
destroyed
periosteum
doctor
what
is
that
again
it
is
the
the
strong
membrane
which
incloses
the
bone
and
through
which
it
is
made
in
this
case
it
is
absolutely
destroyed
removed
torn
to
shreds
gone
so
there
are
several
reasons
why
he
can
not
be
saved
doctor
kelly
do
you
intend
to
let
him
lie
there
and
die
oh
no
oh
no
i
will
do
all
in
my
power
for
him
i
am
paid
for
that
it
is
my
duty
but
it
is
not
your
duty
to
sacrifice
your
own
life
in
a
vain
effort
to
save
another
doctor
kelly
he
not
die
i
will
not
let
him
i
know
nothing
about
your
books
and
bones
but
he
can
live
with
one
bone
wanting
and
i
tell
you
he
shall
not
die
and
i
will
not
die
either
it
was
a
week
or
more
after
this
conversation
i
found
my
patient
one
morning
with
blue
lips
and
a
pinched
nose
and
said
to
him
what
is
this
well
i
had
a
chill
last
night
a
chill
and
did
not
send
for
me
you
were
here
until
after
midnight
and
must
have
some
rest
corporal
kendall
how
you
talk
to
me
in
that
manner
you
promised
to
send
for
me
if
there
were
any
change
for
the
worse
and
after
this
i
can
not
trust
you
now
i
must
stay
here
do
you
think
i
am
going
to
lose
my
investment
in
you
do
you
suppose
i
would
work
over
you
as
i
have
been
doing
and
then
drop
you
for
fear
of
a
little
more
work
as
i
passed
to
the
kitchen
i
found
that
blue
lips
and
pinched
noses
had
suddenly
come
into
fashion
that
there
were
more
of
them
than
i
had
time
to
count
but
did
not
for
a
moment
dream
of
letting
a
man
get
into
the
graveyard
by
that
gate
the
merry
young
irishman
who
had
volunteered
as
my
orderly
had
a
period
of
active
service
and
no
more
willing
pair
of
hands
and
feet
ever
were
interposed
between
men
and
death
hot
bricks
hot
blankets
bottles
of
hot
water
hot
whisky
punch
and
green
tea
were
the
order
of
the
forenoon
and
of
a
good
many
hours
of
night
and
day
after
it
for
that
victory
was
won
by
a
long
struggle
for
ten
nights
i
never
lay
down
in
my
room
but
slept
all
i
did
sleep
lying
on
a
cot
about
the
center
of
ward
four
and
two
cots
from
the
man
minus
a
bone
i
could
drop
asleep
in
an
instant
and
sleep
during
ordinary
movements
but
a
change
in
a
voice
brought
me
to
my
post
in
a
moment
i
could
command
anything
in
the
dispensary
or
at
any
hour
of
the
day
or
night
and
carried
many
a
man
through
the
crisis
of
a
night
attack
when
if
he
had
been
left
until
discovered
in
the
morning
there
would
have
been
little
hope
for
him
and
when
a
surgeon
could
have
done
nothing
without
a
key
to
the
kitchen
which
none
of
them
had
i
kept
no
secrets
from
any
of
them
told
each
one
just
what
i
had
done
in
his
ward
thankfully
received
his
approval
and
directions
asked
about
things
i
did
not
understand
and
was
careful
that
my
nursing
was
in
harmony
with
his
surgery
during
that
there
was
one
night
that
death
seemed
to
be
gaining
the
victory
in
corporal
kendall

pain
defied
my
utmost
efforts
and
held
the
citadel
sleep
fled
the
circulation
grew
sluggish
and
both
he
and
i
knew
that
the
result
hung
on
the
hour
it
was
two
and
from
midnight
i
had
been
trying
to
bring
rest
the
injured
limb
was
suspended
in
a
zinc
trough
i
had
raised
lowered
it
by
imperceptible
motions

where
it
seemed
to
bind
tucked
in

kept
the
toes
in

irritated
the
surface
wherever
i
could
get
the
point
of
a
finger
in
through
the
bandages
kept
up
the
heat
of
the
body
and
the
hope
of
the
soul
and
sat
down
to
hold
his
hands
and
try
mesmeric
passes
and
sounds
when
he
turned
his
head
on
the
pillow
and
said
even
if
i
should
get
well
i
never
be
fit
for
infantry
service
again
no
you
never
will
i
might
walk
with
that
machine
you
talk
of
but
never
could
march
and
carry
a
knapsack
but
i
have
been
thinking
i
am
a
pretty
good
engineer
you
know
secretary
stanton
you
might
get
me
transferred
to
the
navy
and
i
could
run
an
engine
on
a
gunboat
that
is
it
exactly
you
will
get
over
this
i
will
have
you
transferred
to
a
gunboat
and
next
time
you
will
go
into
the
rebellion
prow
foremost
you
ought
to
be
at
work
in
time
to
help
take
charleston
i
continued
to
talk
in
a
croone
to
stroke
his
head
and
hold
his
hand
until
he
slept
which
was
but
a
few
moments
after
settling
that
transfer
and
the
last
time
i
saw
him
which
was
in
he
got
over
the
ground
and
up
and
down
stairs
as
fast
as
most
people
his
new
bone
being
quite
as
good
as
any
of
the
old
ones
except
being
a
little
short
and
decidedly
crooked
although
the
crook
did
not
effect
its
usefulness
or
general
appearance

two
kinds
of
appreciation
looking
down
the
long
vista
of
memory
to
the
many
faces
turned
to
me
from
beds
of
pain
i
find
few
to
which
i
can
attach
a
name
and
one
i
seem
never
to
have
looked
upon
but
once
it
is
a
long
sallow
face
surmounted
by
bushy
yellow
hair
it
has
a
clear
oval
outline
and
straight
nose
brown
eyes
and
a
down
of
young
manhood
on
the
wasted
trembling
lips
i
knew
it
then
as
the
face
of
a
fever
patient
but
not
one
to
whom
i
had
rendered
any
special
service
and
felt
surprised
when
the
trembling
lips
said
in
a
pitiful
pleading
way
we
boys
has
been
a
talkin
about
you
have
you
my
dear
and
what
have
you
boys
been
saying
about
me
we
jist
been
a
sayin
that
good
many
ladies
has
been
kind
to
us
but
none
uv
ever
loved
us
but
you
well
my
dear
i
do
not
know
how
it
is
with
the
other
ladies
but
i
am
sure
i
do
love
you
very
very
dearly
you
do
not
know
half
how
much
i
love
you
oh
yes
we
do
yes
we
do
we
know
you
do
take
care
uv
us
it
your
juty
you
jist
do
it
you
love
to
that
is
it
exactly
just
because
i
love
to
and
because
i
want
you
to
get
well
and
go
to
your
mothers
yes
but
the
boys
says
you
do
care
about
when
they
get
well
they
do
not
need
to
have
me
care
for
them
when
they
are
well
oh
yes
they
do
yes
they
do
an
if
that
the
way
you
a
goin
to
serve
me
i
stay
sick
a
long
time

hospital
stores
came
to
me
so
fast
that
there
was

them

lent
me
an
ambulance
to
go
around
see
where
they
were
needed
and
supply
as
many
as
i
could
i
had
a
letter
from
an
old
pittsburg
neighbor
asking
me
to
see
his
brother
in
douglas
hospital
and
went
in
an
ambulance
well
supplied
with
jellies
and
fruit
douglas
hospital
was
an
institution
of
which
the
city
was
proud
it
had
much
finer
buildings
than
any
other
in
the
city
occupied
the
finest
residence
block
in
the
city
and
had
a
wide
reputation
for
grandeur
and
beauty
and
superb
management
i
found
the
halls
and
rooms
quite
as
elegant
as
i
had
any
reason
to
expect
but
was
surprised
to
find
that
elegance
undisturbed
by
the
presence
of
sick
or
wounded
men
in
one
back
room
a
wounded
officer
looked
lonely
and
they
said
there
were
other
rooms
used
for
sick
soldiers
but
all
i
saw
were
parlors
reception
rooms
offices
and
sleeping
apartments
for
surgeons
and
the
lady
abbess
with
her
attendant
sisters
of
mercy
or
charity
after
we
had
strolled
through
several
sumptuous
apartments
we
were
taken
out
into
the
adjoining
square
where
there
were
large
barracks
as
white
as
lime
and
brushes
could
make
them
and
making
a
pretty
picture
among
the
trees
inside
the
walls
were
white
as
on
the
outside
and
the
pictures
already
up
as
well
as
those
just
being
put
up
were
bright
as
bright
could
be
indeed
i
do
not
know
how
pictures
could
have
been
greener
or
bluer
or
yellower
or
redder
and
when
the
man
called
my
attention
to
them
as
calculated
to
make
the
place
cheerful
i
recognized
their
merit
but
suggested
that
some
paper
blinds
might
be
desirable
to
keep
the
sun
from
shining
into
the
faces
of
the
men
who
lay
on
the
cots
the
roof
or
walls
did
not
seem
well
calculated
to
keep
out
wind
or
rain
but
paper
blinds
would
ward
off
sunshine
from
the
condition
of
the
floor
it
was
evident
that
the
demon
of
the
scrubbing
brush
which
has
possession
of
all
model
institutions
had
full
sway
in
douglas
barracks
pine
boards
could
not
well
have
been
made
whiter
no
laundry
man
need
have
feared
to
own
to
the
doing
up
of
the
bed
linen
and
counterpanes
and
science
had
not
discovered
any
mode
of
making
a
bed
look
more
like
a
packing
box
than
those
in
that
model
hospital
what
an
impertinence
a
sick
or
wounded
man
was
in
one
of
those
nice
square
beds
he
was
almost
certain
to
muss
and
toss
it
and
this
must
have
been
a
crowning
calamity
after
the
showman
had
shown
all
he
cared
to
have
me
see
i
sat
talking
with
the
man
i
had
come
to
visit
and
he
said
in
a
whisper
are
there
lice
in
all
the
hospitals
lice
why
certainly
not
well
there
are
plenty
of
them
here
and
they
tell
us
they
can
not
be
helped
that
they
have
them
in
all
the
hospitals
look
here
he
turned
down
the
nice
counterpane
and
there
in
the
blanket
the
disgusting
creatures
swarmed
i
was
shocked
and
half
rose
in
the
impulse
to
make
an
outcry
but
he
warned
me
not
to
let
any
one
know
he
had
told
me
or
it
would
be
bad
for
him
i
asked
why
he
did
not
tell
the
surgeon
he
knows
all
about
them
and
says
they
can
not
be
helped
you
have
sisters
of
charity
here
tell
them
oh
they
never
do
anything
in
the
ward
but
walk
around
and
talk
nice
and
pray
with
men
who
are
going
to
die
they
must
know
about
them
i
walked
around
alone
and
the
did
not
seem
to
like
it
but
i
talked
with
the
men
in
the
cots
put
my
hand
under
the
cover
found
feet
encrusted
with
the
exudations
of
fever
until
they
were
hard
and
dry
as
a
bit
of
kindling
wood
hair
full
of
dust
from
the
and
not
one
man
who
had
been
washed
since
being
carried
away
from
it
while
there
were
vermin
in
every
bed
the
objected
to
my
leaving
a
jar
of
jelly
with
my
friend
it
would
spoil
the
good
order
of
the
ward
and
all
delicacies
were
to
be
given
into
the
care
of
the
sisters
i
found
one
of
them
who
was
quite
willing
to
take
charge
of
anything
i
wished
to
leave
but
was
powerless
in
the
matter
of
vermin
it
was
the
ward
master
business
to
attend
to
that
it
was
the
business
of
the
sisters
to
look
after
the
clothing
when
it
came
from
the
laundry
put
it
in
order
and
give
it
out
when
wanted
my
failure
to
get
a
bed
for
the
man
in
the
fort
by
applying
to
those
in
authority
made
me
feel
that
it
would
be
useless
to
try
that
plan
about
the
vermin
and
in
my
perplexity
i
turned
to
my
old
friend
and
confidant
the
public
to
reach
it
i
wrote
to
the
york
giving
a
very
mild
statement
of
the
case
two
days
after
surgeon
baxter
came
with
a
copy
of
that
letter
and
told
me
he
had
been
ordered
to
discharge
me
on
account
of
it
i
spoke
of
the
men
who
must
die
if
i
left
and
he
was
sorry
but
had
no
option
then
he
bethought
him
that
maybe
i
might
get
the
to
permit
me
to
remain
at
least
until
the
cases
of
my
special
patients
were
settled
otherwise
i
must
leave
the
hospital
that
day
he
was
sorry
i
had
dated
the
letter
from
campbell
had
it
not
been
for
this
he
could
use
his
influence
to
sustain
me
but
professional
etiquette
forbade
him
to
harbor
or
countenance
one
who
spoke
unfavorably
of
a
in
other
words
by
living
in
a
hospital
i
became
one
of
a
ring
bound
to
keep
hospital
secrets
and
use
only
words
of
commendation
in
speaking
or
writing
of
anything
i
saw
i
took
a
street
car
and
proceeded
to
the
office
of
the
saw
the
man
who
held
the
lives
of
my
patients
in
his
hands
ate
the
only
piece
of
humble
pie
that
over
crossed
my
lips
by
apologizing
for
telling
the
truth
and
got
permission
to
go
back
to
the
men
who
looked
to
me
for
life
i
have
felt
that
i
made
a
great
mistake
felt
that
if
i
had
then
and
there
made
war
to
the
knife
and
the
knife
to
the
hilt
against
the
whole
system
of
fraud
and
cruelty
embodied
in
the
hospital
service
i
should
have
saved
many
more
lives
in
the
end
even
while
i
talked
to
the
head
of
that
nest
of
corruption
and
listened
to
his
inane
platitudes
about
my
duty
as
an
inmate
of
a
hospital
to
report
abuses
to
him
and
the
regular
way
of
proceeding
i
did
want
to
hurl
the
gauntlet
of
an
irregular
defiance
into
his
plausible
face
but
the
pleading
eyes
in
campbell
held
me
i
could
not
let
those
men
die
and
die
they
must
if
i
must
leave
them
nobody
denied
the
truth
of
my
statements
about
douglas
hospital
and
i
never
learned
that
any
one
objected
to
the
facts
or
their
continuance
it
was
only
their
exposure
which
gave
offense
this
letter
made
me
an
object
of
dread
folks
never
knew
what
i
might
see
or
say
next
and
there
soon
arose
another
trouble
about
my
living
in
campbell
for
miss
dix
objected
claimed
that
it
was
an
infringement
on
her
authority
then
again
there
were
others
who
could
not
see
why
there
should
be
but
one
female
nurse
in
campbell
baxter
by
admitting
me
had
abandoned
his
ground
acknowledged
that
men
alone
could
not
manage
a
hospital
and
having
discovered
his
mistake
was
bound
to
rectify
it
by
admitting
a
corps
of
lady
nurses
he
was
bombarded
by
miss
dix
official
power
pestered
by
the
persistant
appeals
of
volunteers
sneered
and
scoffed
at
and
worried
until
he
fell
back
on
his
old
position
and
promptly
dismissed
me
so
soon
as
my
patients
were
out
of
danger
he
was
always
courteous
to
me
as
a
visiter
and
has
my
lasting
gratitude
and
respect
for
breaking
his
rules
and
bearing
the
persecution
he
did
that
i
might
do
the
work
i
did
and
could
not
have
done
without
his
effective
and
generous
the
proportion
of
thigh
stumps
saved
was
the
test
of
a
success
and
the
summer
i
was
in
campbell
we
saved
nineteen
out
of
twenty
next
summer
chaplain
gaylord
told
me
they
lost
nineteen
in
twenty
and
added
piemia
has
literally
swept
our
wards
chapter
lxv
life
and
death
when
released
from
the
hospital
i
had
neither
money
nor
clothes
and
this
is
all
the
account
i
can
render
to
the
generous
people
who
sent
me
hospital
stores
i
could
not
answer
their
letters
some
of
them
i
never
read
i
could
only
give
up
my
life
to
distributing
their
bounty
and
knew
that
neither
their
money
nor
my
own
had
remained
in
my
hands
when
it
was
necessary
for
me
to
borrow
two
dollars
to
get
a
dress
my
cloth
traveling
suit
was
no
longer
fit
for
use
and
my
platform
suit
too
good
these
were
all
i
had
brought
to
washington
but
the
best
men
never
refused
me
audience
because
i
wore
a
shaker
bonnet
a
black
lawn
skirt
and
gray
linen
sack
some
thought
i
dressed
in
that
way
to
be
odd
but
it
was
all
i
could
afford
the
had
canceled
my
appointment
because
i
had
not
reported
for
duty
but
secretary
stanton
reinstated
me
and
i
went
to
work
on
the
largest
salary
i
had
ever
received
fifty
dollars
a
month
after
some
time
it
was
raised
to
sixty
and
i
was
more
than
independent
but
my
health
was
so
broken
that
half
a
dozen
doctors
commanded
me
to
lie
on
my
back
for
a
month
and
i
spent
every
moment
i
could
in
that
position
i
had
grown
hysterical
and
twice
while
at
work
in
the
office
broke
out
into
passionate
weeping
while
thinking
of
something
in
my
hospital
experience
something
i
had
borne
when
it
occurred
without
a
tear
or
even
without
feeling
a
desire
to
weep
in
september
i
had
twenty
days
leave
of
absence
to
go
to
st
cloud
settle
my
business
and
bring
my
household
gods
there
were
still
no
railroads
in
minnesota
and
i
was
six
days
going
must
have
six
to
return
and
one
to
visit
friends
at
pittsburg
yet
in
the
time
left
sold
closed
my
home
and
met
lowrie
for
the
first
and
last
time
he
called
and
we
spent
an
hour
talking
principally
of
the
war
which
he
thought
would
result
in
two
separate
governments
his
reason
seemed
to
be
entirely
restored
but
his
prestige
power
wealth
and
health
were
gone
i
tried
to
avoid
all
personal
matters
as
well
as
reference
to
our
quarrel
but
he
broke
into
the
conversation
to
say
i
am
the
only
person
who
ever
understood
you
people
now
think
you
go
into
hospitals
from
a
sense
of
duty
from
benevolence
like
those
good
people
who
expect
to
get
to
heaven
by
doing
disagreeable
things
on
earth
but
i
know
you
go
because
you
must
go
for
your
own
pleasure
you
do
not
care
for
heaven
or
anything
else
but
yourself
he
stopped
looked
down
traced
the
pattern
of
the
carpet
with
the
point
of
his
cane
then
raised
his
head
and
continued
you
take
care
of
the
sick
and
wounded
go
into
all
those
dreadful
places
just
as
i
used
to
drink
brandy
for
sake
of
the
exhilaration
it
brings
you
we
shook
hands
on
parting
and
from
our
inmost
hearts
i
am
sure
wished
each
other
well
i
was
more
than
ever
impressed
by
the
genuine
greatness
of
the
man
who
had
been
degraded
by
the
use
of
irresponsible
power
we
reached
washington
in
good
time
and
i
soon
realized
the
great
advantage
of
rest
six
hours
of
office
work
came
so
near
nothing
to
do
that
had
i
been
in
usual
health
i
should
probably
have
raised
some
disturbance
from
sheer
idleness
but
i
learned
by
and
by
that
the
close
attention
demanded
to
avoid
mistakes
could
not
well
have
been
continued
longer
several
ladies
continued
distributing
hospital
stores
for
me
all
that
fall
and
winter
and
next
spring
i
still
had
some
to
send
out
when
able
i
went
myself
and
in
carver
found
a
man
who
had
been
wounded
in
a
cavalry
charge
said
to
have
been
as
desperate
as
that
of
the
light
brigade
and
who
refused
to
take
anything
from
me
because
he
had
seen
enough
of
these
people
who
go
around
hospitals
pretending
to
take
care
of
wounded
soldiers
i
convinced
him
it
was
his
duty
to
take
the
jelly
in
order
to
prevent
my
stealing
it
also
that
it
was
for
my
interest
to
save
his
life
that
i
might
not
have
to
pay
my
share
of
the
cost
of
burying
him
and
getting
a
man
in
his
place
nay
that
it
was
my
duty
to
get
him
back
into
the
saddle
as
fast
as
possible
that
my
government
need
not
pay
him
for
lying
abed
he
liked
this
view
of
the
case
and
not
only
took
what
i
offered
him
but
next
time
i
went
asked
for
shoes
to
support
his
foot
and
when
i
brought
them
said
he
would
be
ready
for
duty
in
a
week
in
judiciary
square
a
surgeon
asked
me
to
give
a
jar
of
currant
jelly
to
a
man
in
ward
six
who
was
fatally
wounded
i
found
the
man
those
in
the
neighboring
cots
and
the
nurse
all
very
sad
talked
to
him
a
few
moments
and
said
you
think
you
are
going
to
die
that
is
what
they
all
say
i
must
do
well
i
say
you
are
not
going
to
do
anything
of
the
kind
oh
i
guess
i
am
not
unless
you
have
made
up
your
mind
to
it
and
are
quite
determined
those
hip
wounds
kill
a
great
many
men
because
folks
do
not
know
how
to
manage
them
and
because
the
men
are
easy
to
kill
but
it
takes
a
good
deal
to
kill
a
young
man
with
a
good
conscience
who
has
never
drank
liquor
or
used
tobacco
who
has
muscle
like
yours
a
red
beard
and
blue
gray
eyes
i
summoned
both
his
day
and
night
nurse
told
all
three
together
of
the
surgical
that
old
mother
nature
wanted
made
and
kept
open
clear
up
to
the
center
of
that
wound
the
surgeon
would
always
make
one
if
the
patient
wanted
it
i
told
them
about
the
warmth
and
nourishment
and
care
needed
and
left
him
and
them
full
of
hope
and
resolution
next
time
i
was
in
judiciary
a
young
man
on
crutches
accosted
me
saying
were
not
you
in
ward
six
about
six
weeks
ago
yes
do
you
remember
a
man
there
that
every
one
said
was
going
to
die
and
you
said
he
would
yes
well
i
the
fellow
i
looked
at
him
inquiringly
and
said
well
did
you
die
he
burst
into
uproarious
laughter
and
replied
no
but
i
blamed
if
i
would
if
you
had
come
along
i
passed
on
left
him
leaning
against
the
wall
finishing
his
laugh
and
saw
or
heard
of
him
no
more
it
was
but
a
few
days
after
he
passed
out
of
my
knowledge
that
news
came
of
the
death
of
lowrie
it
was
the
old
story
the
great
man
down
for
he
died
in
poverty
and
neglect
but
with
his
better
self
in
the
ascendent
his
body
lies
in
an
unmarked
grave
in
that
land
where
once
his
word
was
law
pondering
on
his
death
i
thought
of
that
country
boy
going
to
his
father
house
with
the
life
restored
by
one
he
knew
not
even
by
name
and
the
going
home
of
that
mature
man
who
thought
he
knew
my
inmost
soul
and
with
whose
political
death
i
was
charged
only
the
wisdom
of
eternity
can
determine
which
if
either
i
served
or
injured
to
the
one
life
may
lack
blessing
to
the
other
death
be
all
gain
chapter
lxvi
meet
miss
dix
and
go
to
fredericksburg
i
sat
down
stairs
for
the
first
time
after
a
two
weeks
illness
when
georgie
willets
of
jersey
city
came
in
saying
here
is
a
pass
for
you
and
one
for
me
to
go
to
fredericksburg
a
boat
leaves
in
two
hours
and
we
must
hurry
for
several
days
the
air
had
shuddered
with
accounts
of
the
terrible
suffering
of
our
men
wounded
in
the
battle
of
the
wilderness
and
a
pall
of
uncertainty
and
gloom
hung
over
the
city
i
made
a
tuck
in
a
dress
donned
it
selected
a
light
satchel
put
into
one
side
a
bottle
of
whiskey
and
one
of
sherry
half
a
pound
of
green
tea
two
rolls
of
bandage
and
as
much
old
as
packed
them
close
put
some
clothing
for
myself
in
the
other
side
and
a
cake
of
black
castile
soap
for
cleansing
wounds
took
a
pair
of
good
scissors
with
one
sharp
point
and
a
small
rubber
syringe
as
surgical
instruments
put
these
in
my
pocket
with
strings
attaching
them
to
my
belt
got
on
my
shaker
bonnet
and
with
a
large
blanket
shawl
and
tin
cup
was
on
board
with
georgie
an
hour
before
the
boat
left
it
had
brought
a
load
of
wounded
from
belle
plain
some
were
still
on
board
and
suffering
intensely
from
thirst
and
hard
dry
dressings
it
was
a
hot
day
and
we
both
went
to
work
giving
drinks
of
water
wetting
wounds
and
bathing
hot
heads
and
hands
as
georgie
passed
the
foot
of
the
cabin
stairs
miss
dix
was
coming
down
and
called
to
her
saying
what
are
you
doing
here
she
made
no
reply
but
passed
on
to
her
work
when
the
irate
lady
turned
to
where
i
was
drawing
water
from
a
cooler
and
asked
in
a
tone
of
high
displeasure
who
is
that
young
girl
miss
georgie
willets
of
jersey
city
i
replied
and
where
is
she
going
to
fredericksburg
by
whose
authority
she
demanded
by
authority
of
the
i
replied
the
has
no
authority
to
send
a
young
girl
down
there
alone
she
is
not
going
alone
who
is
going
with
her
she
asked
tartly
i
am
who
are
you
i
told
her
and
she
ceased
to
be
insulting
long
enough
to
expostulate
on
the
great
impropriety
of
the
proceeding
as
well
as
to
explain
the
total
lack
of
any
need
of
help
in
fredericksburg
she
had
just
returned
from
that
city
where
she
had
arranged
everything
in
the
most
satisfactory
manner
hospitals
had
been
established
with
surgeons
and
nurses
there
was
therefore
not
the
slightest
occasion
for
our
going
further
but
she
was
about
to
organize
relief
for
the
men
while
waiting
at
the
washington
wharf
to
be
taken
to
hospitals
here
i
might
be
useful
and
here
she
would
be
glad
to
have
me
work
but
as
for
that
handsome
young
girl
she
wondered
at
me
for
bringing
her
into
such
a
place
georgie
was
not
merely
handsome
she
was
grand
queenly
and
i
told
miss
dix
that
i
differed
with
her
about
the
kind
of
women
who
should
go
into
such
places
we
wanted
young
vigorous
women
women
whose
and
social
position
would
command
the
respect
of
those
to
whom
they
ministered
she
grew
angry
again
and
said
she
shall
not
go
to
fredericksburg
i
will
have
her
arrested
i
was
kneeling
beside
a
man
whose
wounds
i
was
bathing
for
i
had
not
suspended
my
work
to
talk
with
her
who
stood
straight
as
a
telegraph
pole
holding
a
bottle
which
she
ever
and
anon
applied
to
her
nose
but
when
she
reached
this
climax
i
raised
my
head
looked
into
her
face
and
said
i
shall
not
be
sorry
miss
dix
if
you
do
for
then
i
shall
apply
to
my
friends
abraham
lincoln
and
secretary
stanton
and
have
your
authority
tested
i
went
on
with
my
work
she
growled
something
and
left
the
boat
but
did
not
disturb
us
further
going
down
the
river
i
grew
worse
and
thought
i
might
be
obliged
to
return
with
the
boat
and
stay
at
home
but
consulted
a
surgeon
on
his
way
to
the
front
who
talked
with
another
and
said
there
is
no
immediate
danger
in
your
case
it
is
only
secondary
hemorrhage
and
with
care
you
may
go
on
but
must
not
attempt
to
do
anything
you
can
however
be
of
incalculable
service
simply
by
being
in
fredericksburg
can
sit
down
and
see
that
people
do
their
duty
what
our
wounded
need
most
is
people
who
have
an
interest
in
their
welfare
friends
you
can
do
a
great
deal
toward
supplying
this
want
this
great
need
but
be
careful
and
do
not
try
to
work
after
some
time
this
surgeon
brought
and
introduced
chamberlain
of
maine
evidently
an
invalid
and
a
man
of
the
purely
intellectual
type
two
other
surgeons
were
with
him
and
all
three
endeavored
to
persuade
him
to
return
to
washington
as
his
lack
of
health
made
it
very
dangerous
if
not
quite
useless
for
him
to
go
to
the
front
i
thought
the
surgeons
right
and
told
him
i
feared
he
was
throwing
away
his
life
in
an
effort
to
do
the
impossible
he
explained
that
he
was
in
command
of
a
brigade
of
eight
regiments
that
in
them
were
hundreds
of
his
neighbors
and
pupils
for
he
had
resigned
a
professorship
in
a
college
to
enlist
said
he
knew
his
own
constitution
better
than
any
one
else
could
know
it
knew
he
would
be
stronger
when
he
reached
his
post
and
that
the
danger
would
be
in
any
attempt
to
keep
out
of
danger
the
danger
which
his
men
must
face
turning
to
me
he
said
if
you
had
eight
children
down
there
you
would
go
to
them
if
you
could
we
arranged
that
if
he
should
be
wounded
so
as
to
suffer
a
thigh
amputation
he
should
let
me
know
that
i
might
nurse
him
through
at
belle
plaine
georgie
went
to
look
for
transportation
and
i
to
the
sanitary
commission
boat
where
i
was
introduced
to
barlow
and
miss
hancock
both
busy
furnishing
hot
coffee
to
those
being
embarked
for
washington
barlow
was
a
tall
superbly
formed
woman
very
handsome
and
full
of
health
and
spirits
she
looked
down
on
me
compassionately
and
said
oh
you
poor
little
thing
what
ever
brought
you
here
we
have
sick
folks
enough
now
do
sit
down
until
i
get
you
a
cup
of
tea
while
i
drank
the
tea
she
stood
looking
at
me
and
said
meditatively
oh
you
queer
little
thing
and
hurried
off
to
her
work
soon
a
colonel
with
a
badly
wounded
head
came
on
board
leaned
against
a
post
and
groaned
i
found
a
basin
of
water
and
a
towel
and
began
bathing
his
head
wetting
those
torturing
dressings
and
making
him
comparatively
comfortable
when
she
stopped
in
her
hurried
walk
looked
on
an
instant
and
exclaimed
oh
you
nice
little
thing
now
i
see
what
you
are
good
for
i
could
not
do
that
but
you
will
take
care
of
their
wounds
and
i
will
feed
them
that
will
be
grand
soon
georgie
came
to
say
there
was
no
transportation
to
be
had
but
she
had
found
a
campbell
surgeon
in
charge
of
a
hospital
tent
and
he
wanted
me
said
he
was
worn
out
and
had
plenty
of
work
for
both
of
us
the
doctor
had
a
large
tent
filled
with
wounded
lying
on
loose
hay
his
patients
seemed
to
want
for
nothing
but
he
must
needs
give
so
much
time
to
receiving
and
forwarding
those
pouring
in
from
the
front
that
he
needed
us
he
had
a
little
tent
put
up
for
us
and
that
was
the
only
night
i
have
ever
slept
in
a
tent
next
morning
while
we
were
attending
to
a
colonel
and
lieutenant
colonel
both
of
the
same
regiment
and
both
badly
wounded
and
just
brought
in
one
said
to
the
other
my
god
if
our
men
in
fredericksburg
could
have
a
little
of
this
care
why
said
i
i
have
heard
that
everything
possible
was
being
done
for
them
everything
possible
exclaimed
one
and
both
together
began
the
most
terrible
recital
of
the
neglect
and
abuse
of
the
wounded
in
that
horrible
place
men
dying
of
thirst
and
women
spitting
in
their
faces
kicking
and
spurning
them
we
set
down
our
basins
georgie
started
in
one
direction
and
i
in
another
to
find
transportation
the
surgeon
in
command
of
the
station
stood
superintending
the
loading
of
oats
while
he
looked
at
my
pass
and
said
he
could
not
possibly
send
us
adding
fredericksburg
is
no
place
for
a
lady
it
is
impossible
to
describe
the
condition
of
things
there
but
doctor
i
am
not
a
lady
i
am
a
hospital
nurse
the
place
where
men
are
suffering
must
be
the
place
for
me
i
do
not
look
strong
but
you
can
not
think
how
much
i
can
do
but
madam
you
forget
that
our
army
is
cut
off
from
its
base
of
supplies
and
must
be
furnished
with
subsistence
and
that
we
have
not
half
the
transportations
we
need
doctor
you
are
sending
bags
of
oats
in
ambulances
i
do
not
weigh
much
more
than
one
and
will
be
worth
six
when
you
get
me
there
he
promised
to
send
me
that
afternoon
but
i
doubted
him
went
to
the
christian
commission
tent
found
a
man
who
knew
me
by
reputation
and
told
him
they
had
better
send
me
to
fredericksburg
or
put
me
under
arrest
for
i
was
in
a
mood
to
be
dangerous
he
feigned
fright
caught
up
his
hat
and
said
we
get
you
out
of
this
in
the
shortest
possible
space
of
time
an
hour
after
i
was
on
the
way
and
georgie
a
few
moments
in
advance
i
had
seen
bad
roads
in
northern
and
western
pennsylvania
but
this
was
my
first
ride
over
no
road
we
met
a
steady
stream
of
such
wounded
as
were
able
to
walk
but
comparatively
few
were
brought
in
ambulances
it
was
raining
when
we
reached
fredericksburg
at
four
on
sabbath
and
i
went
to
the
surgeon
in
command
reported
and
asked
him
to
send
me
to
the
worst
place
the
place
where
there
was
most
need
then
i
had
better
send
you
to
the
old
theater
for
i
can
get
no
one
to
stay
there
he
gave
me
my
appointment
and
i
went
to
a
corps
surgeon
who
signed
it
and
advised
me
not
to
go
to
the
theater
i
could
do
nothing
as
the
place
was
in
such
dreadful
condition
while
i
could
be
useful
in
many
other
places
chapter
lxvii
the
old
theater
this
building
was
on
princess
ann
street
the
basement
floor
was
level
with
the
sidewalk
but
the
ground
sloped
upward
at
the
back
so
that
the
yard
was
higher
than
the
floor
across
the
front
was
a
vestibule
with
two
flights
of
stairs
leading
up
to
the
auditorium
behind
the
vestibule
a
large
low
room
with
two
rows
of
pillars
supporting
the
upper
floor
and
behind
this
three
small
rooms
and
a
square
hall
with
a
side
entrance
the
fence
was
down
between
the
theater
and
catholic
church
next
door
i
stopped
in
the
church
to
see
georgie
who
was
already
at
work
there
came
and
left
by
the
back
door
and
entered
the
theater
by
the
side
hall
the
mud
was
running
in
from
the
yard
opposite
the
door
in
a
small
room
was
a
pile
of
knapsacks
and
blankets
and
on
them
lay
two
men
smoking
to
get
into
the
large
room
i
must
step
out
of
the
hall
mud
over
one
man
and
be
careful
not
to
step
on
another
i
think
it
was
six
rows
of
men
that
lay
close
on
the
floor
with
just
room
to
pass
between
the
feet
of
each
row
they
so
close
in
the
rows
that
in
most
places
i
must
slide
one
foot
before
the
other
to
get
to
their
heads
the
floor
was
very
muddy
and
strewn
with
principally
of
crackers
there
was
one
hundred
and
men
in
the
building
all
desperately
wounded
they
had
been
there
a
week
there
were
two
leather
two
tin
basins
and
about
every
third
man
had
saved
his
or
canteen
but
no
other
vessel
of
any
sort
size
or
description
on
the
premises
no
sink
or
or
drain
the
nurses
were
not
to
be
found
the
men
were
growing
reckless
and
despairing
but
seemed
to
catch
hope
as
i
began
to
thread
my
way
among
them
and
talk
no
other
memory
of
life
is
more
sacred
than
that
of
the
candor
with
which
they
took
me
into
their
confidence
as
if
i
had
been
of
their
own
sex
yet
ever
sought
to
avoid
wounding
the
delicacy
they
ascribed
to
mine
i
found
some
of
the
nurses
cowards
who
had
run
away
from
battle
and
now
ran
from
duty
galvanized
them
into
activity
invented
substitutes
for
things
that
were
wanting
making
good
use
of
an
old
knapsack
and
and
had
tears
of
gratitude
for
pay
one
man
lay
near
the
front
door
in
a
scant
flannel
shirt
and
cotton
drawers
his
left
thigh
cut
off
in
the
middle
and
the
stump
supported
on
the
only
pillow
in
the
house
it
was
six
by
ten
inches
stuffed
with
straw
his
head
was
supported
by
two
bits
of
board
and
a
pair
of
very
muddy
boots
he
called
me
clutched
my
dress
and
plead
mother
ca
you
get
me
a
blanket
i
so
cold
i
could
live
if
i
could
get
any
care
i
went
to
the
room
where
the
men
lay
smoking
on
the
blankets
but
one
of
them
wearing
a
surgeon
shoulderstraps
and
speaking
in
a
german
accent
claimed
them
as
his
private
property
and
positively
refused
to
yield
one
the
other
man
was
his
orderly
and
words
were
useless
they
kept
their
blankets
going
into
a
room
behind
that
i
found
a
man
slightly
wounded
sitting
on
the
floor
supporting
another
who
had
been
shot
across
the
face
and
was
totally
blind
he
called
and
when
i
came
and
talked
with
them
said
wo
you
stay
with
us
stay
with
you
i
replied
well
i
rather
think
i
will
indeed
i
came
to
stay
and
am
one
of
the
folks
it
is
hard
to
drive
away
oh
thank
god
everybody
leaves
us
they
come
and
promise
and
then
go
off
but
i
know
you
will
stay
you
will
do
something
for
us
it
was
so
pitiful
that
for
an
instant
my
courage
failed
and
i
said
i
will
certainly
stay
with
you
but
fear
it
is
little
i
can
do
for
you
oh
you
can
speak
to
us
you
do
not
know
how
good
your
voice
sounds
i
have
not
seen
a
woman
in
three
months
what
is
your
name
my
name
is
mother
mother
oh
my
god
i
have
not
seen
my
mother
for
two
years
let
me
feel
your
hand
i
took
between
both
of
mine
his
hand
covered
with
mud
and
blood
and
smoke
of
battle
and
told
him
i
was
not
only
going
to
stay
with
them
but
was
going
to
send
him
back
to
his
regiment
with
a
lot
more
who
were
lying
around
here
doing
nothing
when
there
was
so
much
fighting
to
be
done
i
had
come
on
purpose
to
make
them
well
and
they
might
make
up
their
minds
to
it
my
own
courage
had
revived
and
i
must
revive
theirs
i
could
surely
keep
them
alive
until
help
should
come
by
softening
the
torturing
bandages
on
his
face
i
made
him
more
comfortable
and
in
an
adjoining
room
found
another
man
with
a
thigh
stump
who
had
been
served
by
as
the
thieves
served
the
man
going
from
jerusalem
to
jericho
stripped
him
left
him
naked
and
half
dead
those
men
surely
did
not
go
into
battle
without
clothes
and
why
they
should
have
been
sent
out
of
the
surgeon
hands
without
enough
of
even
underclothing
to
cover
them
is
the
question
i
have
never
yet
had
answered
common
decency
led
to
his
being
placed
in
the
back
room
alone
but
i
shall
never
blush
for
going
to
him
and
doing
the
little
i
could
for
his
comfort
after
i
returned
to
the
large
room
i
took
notice
about
clothing
and
found
that
most
of
the
men
had
on
their
ordinary
uniform
some
had
two
blankets
more
had
one
but
full
were
without
any
there
was
no
shadow
or
pretense
of
a
bed
or
pillow
not
even
a
handful
of
straw
or
hay
there
was
no
broom
no
hoe
or
shovel
or
spade
to
sweep
or
scrape
the
floor
and
the
horrors
were
falling
upon
me
when
the
man
of
the
blankets
came
and
said
mattam
iv
you
are
goin
to
do
any
ding
for
tese

surprise
and
said

i
called
out
men
what
have
you
had
to
eat
hard
tack
and
something
they
call
coffee
was
the
response
have
you
had
no
meat
meat
we
have
forgotten
what
it
tastes
like
in
one
corner
near
the
front
door
was
a
little
counter
and
desk
with
a
stationary
bench
in
front
to
this
desk
the
surgeon
gave
me
a
key
i
found
writing
material
and
sent
a
note
of
four
lines
to
the
corps
surgeon
half
an
hour
after
an
irate
little
man
stormed
in
and
stamped
around
among
those
prostrate
men
flourishing
a
scrap
of
paper
and
calling
for
the
writer
his
air
was
that
of
the
champion
who
wanted
to
see
the
man
who
struck
billy
patterson
and
his
fierceness
quite
alarmed
me
lest
he
should
step
on
some
of
the
men
so
i
hurried
to
him
and
was
no
little
surprised
to
find
that
the
offending
missive
was
my
note
i
told
him
i
had
written
it
and
could
have
had
no
thought
of
reporting
him
since
i
knew
nothing
about
him
after
considerable
talk
i
learned
that
he
had
charge
of
the
meat
and
that
none
had
been
issued
to
that
place
because
no
requisition
had
been
sent
i
had
never
written
a
requisition
but
found
blanks
in
that
desk
filled
one
signed
it
and
gave
it
to
the
meat
man
who
engaged
that
the
beef
should
be
there
next
morning
it
grew
dark
and
we
had
two
tallow
candles
lighted
may
none
of
my
readers
ever
see
such
darkness
made
visible
such
rows
of
haggard
faces
looking
at
them
from
out
such
cavernous
gloom
i
talked
hopefully
worked
and
walked
while
mentally
exclaiming
oh
god
what
shall
i
do
about
nine
porter
division
surgeon
came
with
georgie
to
take
us
to
our
quarters
these
were
but
half
a
block
away
on
the
same
side
of
the
street
but
on
the
opposite
side
and
corner
of
the
next
in
a
nice
brick
house
with
a
small
yard
in
front
an
old
lady
answered
his
summons
but
refused
to
admit
us
when
he
insisted
and
i
interposed
saying
the
lady
was
afraid
of
soldiers
but
would
admit
us
we
would
bid
him
good
night
and
soon
our
lodgings
would
be
all
right
she
was
relieved
took
us
in
cooked
our
rations
for
herself
and
us
gave
us
a
comfortable
bed
and
was
uniformly
kind
all
the
time
we
staid
and
seemed
sorry
to
have
us
leave
i
spoke
the
first
night
to
porter
about
blankets
and
straw
or
hay
for
beds
but
was
assured
that
none
were
to
be
had
supplies
could
not
reach
them
since
being
cut
off
from
their
base
and
the
provost
marshal
patrick
would
not
permit
anything
to
be
taken
out
of
the
houses
though
many
of
them
were
unoccupied
and
well
supplied
with
bedding
and
other
necessaries
i
thought
we
ought
to
get
two
blankets
for
those
two
naked
men
if
the
government
should
pay
their
weight
in
gold
for
them
and
suggested
that
the
surgeons
take
what
was
necessary
for
the
comfort
of
the
men
and
give
vouchers
to
the
owners
i
knew
such
claims
would
be
honored
would
see
that
they
should
be
but
he
said
the
matter
had
been
settled
by
the
provost
and
nothing
more
could
be
done
it
seems
to
me
now
that
i
must
have
been
benumbed
or
i
could
have
done
something
to
provide
covering
for
those
men
i
did
think
of
giving
one
of
them
my
shawl
but
i
must
have
died
without
it
i
remembered
my
douglas
hospital
letter
and
knew
that
patrick
could
order
me
out
of
fredericksburg
and
leave
these
men
to
rot
in
the
old
theater
already
their
wounds
were
infested
by
worms
which
gnawed
and
tormented
them
some
of
those
wounds
were
turning
black
many
were
green
the
vitality
of
the
men
was
sinking
for
want
of
food
and
warmth
i
could
not
forsake
them
to
look
after
reform
would
not
fail
to
do
what
i
could
in
an
effort
to
do
what
i
could
not
or
might
not
accomplish
in
the
morning
i
saw
that
the
men
had
something
they
called
coffee
and
found
canned
milk
for
it
which
was
nourishment
but
a
new
difficulty
arose
the
men
who
brought
the
coffee
would
distribute
it
to
those
who
had
cups
or
canteens
and
the
others
would
get
none
i
had
some
trouble
to
induce
them
to
leave
their
cans
until
with
the
two
tin
cups
i
could
borrow
i
could
give
about
the
whole
number
the
coffee
they
could
not
otherwise
have
our
cooking
was
done
in
the
churchyard
with
that
of
the
church
patients
a
shed
had
been
put
up
but
our
cooking
was
an
uncovenanted
mercy
and
when
our
beef
came
there
was
a
question
as
to
how
it
could
be
cooked
how
that
additional
work
could
be
done
i
wrote
to
the
stating
our
trouble
and
the
extremity
of
one
hundred
and
men
asked
that
we
might
take
a
out
of
a
vacant
house
near
promised
to
take
good
care
of
it
and
have
it
returned
and
he
wrote
for
answer
i
am
not
a
thief
if
you
want
a
stove
send
to
the
sanitary
commission
he
must
have
known
that
the
commission
was
as
pressed
as
the
government
to
conform
its
arrangements
to
the
movements
of
an
army
cut
off
from
its
base
of
supplies
and
that
it
had
no
stoves
so
the
plain
english
of
his
answer
was
let
your
wounded
die
of
hunger
in
welcome
i
am
here
to
guard
the
property
of
the
citizens
of
fredericksburg
i
had
already
written
to
the
commission
for
blankets
and
a
broom
but
there
were
none
to
be
had
it
soon
however
sent
a
man
who
cut
branches
off
trees
and
with
them
swept
the
floors
chapter
lxviii
am
placed
in
authority
on
monday
morning
i
sent
for
porter
and
stated
the
trouble
about
nurses
shirking
he
had
them
all
summoned
in
the
front
end
of
the
large
room
and
in
presence
of
the
patients
said
to
them
you
see
this
lady
well
you
are
to
report
to
her
for
duty
and
if
she
has
any
fault
to
find
with
you
she
will
report
you
to
the
i
have
never
seen
a
set
of
men
look
more
thoroughly
subdued
there
were
eleven
of
them
and
they
all
gave
me
the
military
salute
the
doctor
went
off
and
i
set
them
to
work
one
irishman
had
had
some
experience
as
a
nurse
could
dress
wounds
slowly
but
very
well
was
faithful
and
kind
and
him
i
made
up
stairs
where
there
were
patients
and
gave
him
three
assistants
for
whom
he
was
to
be
responsible
after
patrick
note
i
calculated
my
resources
and
got
ready
for
a
close
siege
as
i
sat
on
that
little
stationary
bench
making
an
inventory
i
heard
shrieks
groans
and
curses
at
the
far
end
of
the
room
ran
to
the
place
and
got
there
in
time
to
see
the
surgeon
of
the
blankets
tearing
the
dry
dressings
off
a
thigh
stump
coming
up
behind
him
i
caught
him
by
both
ears
and
had
my
hands
full
ordered
him
to
stop
and
said
you
had
better
go
back
to
your
room
and
smoke
again
i
sent
for
surgeon
porter
and
in
less
than
two
hours
that
little
wretch
with
his
orderly
packed
up
his
blankets
and
i
saw
him
or
them
no
more
i
had
never
dressed
a
thigh
stump
but
must
dress
a
good
many
now
i
rolled
that
one
in
a
wet
cloth
and
covered
it
carefully
to
let
the
man
get
time
to
rest
while
i
got
rid
of
his
horrid
tormentor
when
there
was
so
much
to
be
done
i
would
do
the
most
needful
thing
first
and
this
was
ridding
the
wounds
of
worms
and
gangrene
supporting
the
strength
of
the
men
by
proper
food
and
keeping
the
air
as
pure
as
possible
i
got
our
beef
into
the
way
of
being
boiled
and
would
have
some
good
substantial
broth
made
around
it
i
went
on
a
foraging
expedition
found
a
which
would
do
for
a
and
confiscated
it
got
two
bits
of
board
by
which
it
could
be
converted
into
a
stool
and
so
bring
the
great
rest
of
a
change
of
position
to
such
men
as
could
sit
up
had
a
little
drain
made
with
a
bit
of
board
for
a
shovel
and
so
kept
the
mud
from
running
in
at
the
side
door
melted
the
tops
off
some
tin
cans
and
made
them
into
drinking
cups
had
two
of
my
men
confiscate
a
large
tub
from
a
brewery
set
it
in
the
vestibule
to
wash
rags
for
outside
covers
to
wounds
to
keep
off
chill
and
had
others
bring
bricks
and
rubbish
mortar
from
a
ruin
across
the
street
to
make
substitutes
for
pillows
i
dressed
wounds
dressed
wounds
and
made
thorough
work
of
it
in
the
church
was
a
dispensary
where
i
could
get
any
washes
or
medicines
i
wished
and
i
do
not
think
i
left
a
worm
some
of
them
were
over
half
an
inch
long
with
black
heads
and
many
feet
but
most
were
maggots
they
were
often
deeply
seated
but
my
syringe
would
drive
them
out
and
twice
a
day
i
followed
them
up
the
black
and
green
places
grew
smaller
and
better
colored
with
every
dressing
the
men
grew
stronger
with
plenty
of
beef
and
broth
and
canned
milk
i
put
citric
acid
and
sugar
in
their
apple
sauce
as
a
substitute
for
lemons
i
forget
how
many
thigh
stumps
i
had
but
i
think
as
many
as
twelve
one
of
them
was
very
short
and
in
a
very
bad
condition
one
morning
when
i
was
kneeling
and
dressing
it
the
man
burst
into
tears
and
said
you
do
not
seem
to
mind
this
but
i
know
you
would
not
do
it
for
anything
but
the
love
of
god
and
none
but
he
can
ever
reward
you
but
if
i
live
to
see
my
wife
and
children
it
will
be
through
what
you
have
done
for
me
and
i
will
teach
them
to
bless
your
name
he
quite
took
me
by
surprise
for
i
seemed
to
have
forgotten
any
other
life
than
that
i
was
then
living
and
dressing
the
most
frightful
wounds
was
as
natural
as
eating
i
felt
no
disgust
no
shrinking
and
mere
conventional
delicacy
is
withdrawn
when
the
angel
of
death
breathes
upon
it
the
man
we
stepped
over
at
the
back
door
proved
to
be
a
student
from
the
pennsylvania
agricultural
college
shot
through
the
alimentary
canal
near
the
base
of
the
spine
for
him
there
was
no
hope
but
i
did
what
i
could
to
make
him
less
uncomfortable
and
once
he
said
this
is
strange
work
for
a
lady
you
forget
i
said
that
i
am
surgeon
in
charge
that
you
and
i
were
made
of
the
same
kind
of
clay
in
much
the
same
fashion
and
will
soon
turn
into
just
the
same
kind
of
dust
how
my
heart
was
wrung
for
him
with
his
refined
face
dying
for
a
country
which
sent
its
bayonets
to
stand
between
him
and
the
armful
of
straw
with
which
i
might
have
raised
him
above
that
muddy
floor
he
had
no
knapsack
to
serve
as
a
pillow
no
blanket
no
cup
and
his
position
across
the
doorway
was
cold
and
uncomfortable
but
even
after
i
had
made
a
better
place
for
him
he
objected
to
leaving
two
companions
who
lay
next
to
him
and
i
could
not
find
room
for
all
three
together
even
on
that
dirty
floor
he
himself
always
dressed
the
wound
where
the
bullet
entered
and
was
most
grateful
for
the
means
of
doing
so
i
cared
for
that
one
through
which
messenger
made
its
exit
and
although
he
knew
its
condition
he
did
not
know
the
certainty
of
a
fatal
result
and
resented
any
intimation
that
he
should
not
recover
chapter
lxix
visiters
the
second
morning
of
my
work
in
the
old
theater
miss
hancock
came
to
see
how
i
got
along
she
was
thoroughly
practical
and
a
most
efficient
laborer
in
the
hospital
field
and
soon
thought
of
something
to
better
the
condition
of
the
man
minus
clothes
who
lay
quite
near
my
desk
and
the
front
door
and
caught
my
dress
whenever
he
could
to
plead
for
a
blanket
she
could
get
no
blanket
but
was
stationed
in
the
methodist
church
where
there
was
a
surgeon
in
charge
and
everything
running
in
regular
order
in
a
tent
adjoining
this
man
could
be
laid
out
of
the
draught
and
chill
of
that
basement
and
she
would
do
her
best
to
get
some
clothing
for
him
she
sent
two
men
with
a
stretcher
who
took
him
to
the
church
tent
where
i
fear
he
was
not
much
better
provided
for
than
in
the
place
he
left
after
some
days
barlow
came
to
see
the
men
who
all
belonged
to
her
husband
division
and
were
rejoiced
to
see
her
and
to
express
a
general
fear
for
my
life
i
was
to
die
of
overwork
and
want
of
sleep
and
then
she
exclaimed
what
will
become
of
these
men
no
one
but
you
ever
could
or
would
have
done
anything
for
them
do
you
know
there
were
three
surgeons
detailed
for
duty
here
before
you
came
and
none
of
them
would
stay
now
if
you
die
they
will
do
take
some
rest
i
listened
and
looked
at
her
flushed
face
while
she
talked
and
said
barlow
i
am
not
going
to
die
am
in
no
danger
whatever
and
will
hold
out
until
help
comes
this
can
not
last
government
will
come
to
the
rescue
and
my
men
will
be
here
when
it
comes
after
all
is
over
i
will
fall
to
pieces
like
an
old
stage
coach
when
the
drops
out
will
lie
around
as
lumber
for
a
while
then
some
one
will
put
me
together
again
and
i
will
be
good
as
new
it
is
you
who
are
killing
yourself
you
must
change
your
arrangements
or
you
will
take
typhoid
fever
and
after
such
a
strain
recovery
will
be
hopeless
i
take
nobody
disease
am
too
repellant
but
you
will
catch
contagion
very
readily
keep
away
from
fever
cases
and
rest
you
are
in
imminent
peril
she
hurried
away
laughing
at
the
idea
of
one
in
her
perfect
health
being
injured
by
hard
work
but
my
heart
was
full
of
evil
omen
i
had
talked
with
mrs
senator
pomeroy
on
her
way
from
her
last
visit
to
the
contraband
camp
where
she
gave
her
life
in
labor
for
the
friendless
and
poor
and
she
had
looked
very
much
as
barlow
did
that
day
soon
after
this
i
was
made
glad
by
the
sight
of
my
friend
judge
ingersol
people
say
her
daughter
gov
chamberlain
is
a
beauty
but
she
is
not
old
enough
ever
to
have
been
as
beautiful
as
her
mother
that
day
in
her
plain
widow
dress
walking
among
the
wounded
with
her
calm
face
so
full
of
strength
and
gentleness
she
and
barlow
had
hatched
a
rebellion
in
the
city
was
a
barn
containing
straw
for
want
of
which
our
men
were
dying
it
was
guarded
by
one
of
barlow
men
barlow
took
two
others
went
with
them
placed
herself
in
front
of
the
guard
told
them
to
break
open
the
barn
and
carry
out
the
straw
and
him
to
fire
if
he
thought
it
is
duty
but
he
must
reach
them
through
her
the
man
orders
were
to
guard
the
barn
with
the
straw
out
of
it
he
had
nothing
to
do
the
men
moved
side
and
side
going
in
and
out
and
she
kept
in
range
to
cover
them
until
the
last
armful
had
been
removed
it
was
taken
away
and
was
to
be
distributed
but
there
was
still
so
little
compared
to
the
need
that
there
must
be
consultation
about
the
manner
of
using
it
ingersol
thought
it
should
be
made
into
small
pillows
and
volunteered
to
undertake
that
work
as
the
commission
could
furnish
muslin
i
thought
this
best
she
found
a
loft
and
engaged
several
fredericksburg
women
to
work
for
pay
they
worked
one
day
but
did
not
return
on
the
second
there
were
a
good
many
union
women
there
by
this
time
who
should
have
helped
but
few
could
confine
themselves
to
obscure
work
in
a
loft
when
there
was
so
much
excitement
on
the
streets
there
was
no
authority
to
hold
any
one
to
steady
employment
and
so
about
the
helpers
who
reached
fredericksburg
spent
a
large
part
of
their
time
in
an
aimless
wandering
and
wondering
and
finding
so
much
to
be
done
could
do
nothing
so
most
of
the
time
ingersol
was
in
her
loft
alone
except
the
orderlies
who
stuffed
her
slips
sewed
up
the
ends
and
carried
them
off
to
the
places
she
designated
but
she
had
nimble
fingers
and
and
turned
out
a
surprising
number
of
small
straw
pillows
as
my
allowance
came
the
question
was
what
to
do
with
them
they
were
too
precious
for
use
what
should
i
do
with
those
scraps
of
white
on
that
field
of
grime
our
gaunt
horror
became
grotesque
in
view
of
such
unwonted
luxuries
what
a
whole
dozen
or
two
little
straw
pillows
among
one
hundred
and
sixty
men
who
should
elect
the
aristocrats
to
be
cradled
in
such
luxury
amid
that
world
of
want
when
my
aristocrat
was
elected
how
should
his
luxury
be
applied
would
i
put
it
under
his
head
or
mangled
limb
i
think
i
never
realized
our
destitution
until
those
little
pillows
came
to
remind
me
that
sometimes
wounded
men
had
beds
oh
god
would
relief
never
come
like
the
scotch
girl
in
the
besieged
fortress
of
india
i
felt
like
laying
my
ear
to
the
ground
to
harken
for
the
sound
of
the
bagpipes
the
tramp
of
the
campbells
coming
it
did
seem
that
without
surgical
aid
or
comforts
of
any
kind
my
men
must
soon
be
all
past
hope
but
a
surgeon
came
and
i
hailed
him
with
joy
thinking
him
the
advance
guard
of
the
army
of
relief
half
an
hour
after
his
appearance
i
missed
him
and
saw
him
no
more
and
this
was
the
fourth
which
left
those
men
after
being
regularly
detailed
to
duty
among
them
left
them
to
die
or
live
as
they
could
soon
after
this
we
had
an
official
visit
from
one
of
those
laundry
critics
called
medical
inspectors
as
there
were
no
sheets
or
counterpanes
to
look
after
he
turned
his
attention
to
a
heap
of
dry
rubbish
in
the
vestibule
which
gave
the
place
an
untidy
appearance
as
seen
from
the
street
to
remove
this
eyesore
he
had
one
of
my
nurses
hunt
up
a
and
two
shovels
shovels
were
accessible
by
this
time
and
ordered
him
and
another
to
wheel
that
rubbish
out
into
the
street
the
coming
in
the
door
called
my
attention
when
i
learned
that
we
were
going
to
be
made
respectable
i
sent
the
home
gave
the
shovels
to
two
men
to
dig
a
sink
hole
back
in
the
yard
and
forbade
any
disturbance
of
the
dry
harmless
rubbish
in
the
vestibule
i
would
not
have
my
men
choked
with
dust
by
its
removal
and
set
about
getting
up
false
appearances
no
medical
inspector
should
white
that
sepulchre
until
he
cleared
the
dead
men
bones
out
of
it
he
had
not
looked
at
a
wound
did
not
know
if
the
men
had
had
any
dinner
a
man
did
not
need
a
medical
diploma
to
clear
up
after
stage
carpenters
if
the
government
wanted
that
kind
of
work
done
it
had
better
send
a
man
and
cart
with
its
donkey
chapter
lxx
wounded
officers
in
washington
i
had
done
nothing
for
any
wounded
officer
except
a
captain
who
was
brought
to
our
ward
when
all
the
others
were
taken
away
and
in
fredericksburg
i
began
on
that
principle
i
found
twenty
in
the
old
theater
and
had
them
removed
to
private
houses
to
make
room
for
the
men
and
that
they
might
be
better
cared
for
officers
could
be
quartered
in
private
houses
and
have
beds
most
of
those
taken
out
of
the
theater
were
put
into
houses
between
it
and
our
quarters
so
that
i
could
see
them
on
my
way
to
and
from
meals
among
them
was
the
blind
man
who
still
craved
to
hear
me
speak
and
feel
my
hand
and
i
kept
his
face
in
a
wet
compress
until
a
surgeon
was
dressing
it
and
found
the
inflammation
so
gone
that
he
drew
the
lid
of
one
back
and
the
man
cried
out
in
delight
i
can
see
i
can
see
now
let
me
see
mother
i
stood
in
his
range
of
vision
until
the
surgeon
closed
the
lids
when
he
said
now
mother
i
shall
always
remember
just
how
you
look
i
found
in
my
visit
to
those
men
that
some
orderlies
needed
some
one
to
keep
them
in
order
and
that
a
helpless
man
is
not
always
sure
his
servant
will
serve
him
often
the
orderlies
themselves
were
powerless
and
those
men
would
have
suffered
if
i
had
not
cared
for
them
more
than
once
some
of
them
said
i
wish
mother
we
were
back
with
you
in
the
old
theater
there
was
a
captain
whose
stump
i
must
fix
every
night
before
he
could
sleep
and
when
his
wife
came
i
tried
to
teach
her
but
she
was
so
much
afraid
of
hurting
him
she
could
do
nothing
i
learned
in
time
that
officers
quartered
in
private
houses
even
with
the
greater
comforts
they
had
often
suffered
more
than
the
men
in
all
their
privations
barlow
came
for
me
to
see
one
given
up
to
die
and
i
found
him
in
a
large
handsome
room
on
the
first
floor
of
an
elegant
residence
absolutely
hopeless
but
for
years
have
not
been
able
to
recall
the
trouble
in
his
case
it
must
have
been
easy
to
set
right
for
he
began
at
once
to
recover
and
i
felt
that
people
had
been
very
stupid
and
that
there
was
an
unreasonable
amount
of
wonder
and
gratitude
over
whatever
it
was
i
did
it
was
often
so
easy
to
save
a
life
where
there
were
the
means
of
living
that
a
little
courage
or
common
sense
seemed
like
a
miraculous
gift
to
people
whose
mental
powers
had
been
turned
in
other
directions
but
i
found
another
side
to
looking
after
officers
in
private
quarters
one
evening
after
dark
georgia
called
to
tell
me
of
a
dreadful
case
of
suffering
which
a
surgeon
wished
her
to
see
he
was
there
to
accompany
her
but
she
declined
going
without
me
and
i
went
along
walking
close
behind
them
as
the
pavement
was
narrow
he
did
not
seem
to
notice
that
i
was
there
was
troubled
with
the
weight
of
his
diploma
and
shoulderstraps
and
talked
very
patronizingly
to
the
lady
at
his
side
until
she
turned
and
said
to
me
do
you
hear
that
oh
yes
i
replied
and
feel
very
grateful
to
the
young
man
for
his
permission
to
do
the
work
he
is
paid
for
doing
but
if
he
had
reserved
his
patronage
until
some
one
had
asked
for
it
it
would
have
had
more
weight
your
friend
is
sarcastic
was
his
reply
to
her
and
i
said
no
more
until
we
reached
the
case
of
great
distress
which
was
on
the
second
floor
of
a
vacant
house
and
proved
to
be
a
colonel
in
uniform
seated
in
an
easy
chair
smoking
while
his
orderly
sat
in
another
chair
oil
the
other
side
of
the
room
georgie
stood
looking
from
one
man
to
the
other
in
speechless
surprise
but
i
spoke
to
the
man
in
the
chair
saying
how
is
it
sir
that
you
an
officer
in
need
of
nothing
have
trespassed
upon
our
time
and
strength
when
you
know
that
men
are
dying
by
hundreds
for
want
of
care
he
began
to
apologize
and
explain
but
i
said
to
georgie
come
miss
willets
we
are
not
needed
here
as
we
passed
from
the
room
the
surgeon
took
his
cap
to
accompany
us
when
i
stopped
made
a
gesture
and
said
young
man
stay
where
you
are
your
friend
must
be
too
ill
to
do
without
you
i
will
see
the
young
lady
to
her
quarters
the
vidette
is
on
the
corner
and
we
do
not
need
you
we
came
away
filled
with
wonder
but
we
did
not
for
some
time
realize
the
danger
we
came
to
know
that
miss
dix
caution
was
not
altogether
unwise
that
women
had
been
led
into
traps
of
this
kind
when
it
would
have
been
well
for
them
had
they
died
there
and
when
duty
to
themselves
and
the
public
required
them
to
get
one
or
more
doctors
ready
for
dissection
after
that
lesson
however
i
did
not
fear
to
leave
georgie
who
remained
with
the
army
doing
grand
work
until
richmond
fell
but
laying
the
foundation
of
that
consumption
of
which
she
died
of
all
the
lives
which
the
rebellion
cost
us
none
was
more
pure
more
noble
than
that
of
this
beautiful
refined
strong
gentle
girl
chapter
lxxi
now
i
lay
me
down
to
sleep
the
sanitary
commission
soon
got
a
supply
of
clothing
and
sent
two
men
to
wash
and
dress
my
patients
these
with
the
one
sweeping
floors
with
branches
were
an
incalculable
help
and
comfort
but
these
two
did
their
work
and
passed
on
to
other
places
one
of
the
men
they
had
dressed
grew
weak
and
i
was
at
a
loss
to
account
for
his
symptoms
until
by
close
questioning
i
drew
from
him
the
answer
it
is
my
other
wound
these
words
sounded
like
a
but
i
insisted
on
seeing
the
other
wound
and
found
four
bullet
holes
under
his
new
clothes
from
the
one
wound
for
which
i
had
been
caring
he
might
easily
recover
but
with
four
more
so
distributed
that
he
must
lie
on
one
and
no
surgeon
to
make
trap
doors
no
bed
there
was
no
hope
he
was
so
bright
so
good
so
intelligent
so
courageous
it
was
hard
to
give
him
up
ah
if
i
had
him
in
campbell
with
kelly
to
use
the
knife
how
my
heart
clung
to
him
he
lay
near
the
center
of
the
room
with
his
head
close
to
a
column
and
one
night
as
i
knelt
giving
him
drink
and
arranging
his
knapsack
and
brick
pillow
making
the
most
of
his
two
blankets
and
thinking
of
his
mother
at
home
i
was
suddenly
impressed
by
the
beauty
and
grandeur
of
his
face
his
broad
white
brow
shaded
by
bushy
chestnut
hair
half
curling
the
delicate
oval
of
his
cheeks
the
large
expressive
grey
eyes
the
straight
nose
and
firm
chin
and
lips
he
could
not
have
been
more
than
almost
six
feet
high
with
a
frame
full
of
vigor
how
many
such
men
were
there
in
this
land
how
many
could
we
afford
to
sacrifice
in
order
to
preserve
a
country
for
the
use
of
cowards
and
traitors
and
other
inferior
types
of
the
race
the
feeble
light
of
my
candle
threw
this
picture
into
strong
relief
against
the
surrounding
gloom
and
it
was
harder
than
ever
to
give
him
up
but
this
must
be
done
and
i
wanted
to
extract
from
that
bitter
cup
one
drop
of
sweetness
for
his
mother
so
i
said
to
him
now
george
do
you
think
you
can
sleep
he
said
he
could
and
i
added
will
you
pray
before
you
sleep
he
said
he
would
do
you
always
pray
before
going
to
sleep
he
nodded
and
i
continued
let
us
pray
together
just
the
little
prayer
your
mother
taught
you
first
he
clasped
his
hands
and
together
we
repeated
now
i
lay
me
down
to
sleep
to
the
end
when
i
said
do
you
mean
that
george
do
you
mean
to
ask
god
to
keep
your
soul
for
christ
sake
while
you
are
here
and
for
his
sake
to
take
it
to
himself
when
you
go
hence
whenever
that
may
be
the
tears
were
running
over
his
cheeks
and
he
said
solemnly
i
do
then
it
is
all
well
with
you
and
you
can
rest
in
him
who
giveth
his
beloved
sleep
there
was
no
time
for
long
prayers
and
i
must
go
to
another
sufferer
a
kind
strong
man
from
the
michigan
aid
society
came
and
worked
two
days
among
my
men
and
said
if
i
only
had
them
in
a
tent
on
the
ground
but
this
floor
is
dreadful
up
stairs
were
some
wounds
i
must
dress
while
a
corpse
lay
close
beside
one
of
the
men
so
that
i
must
kneel
touching
it
while
i
worked
it
lay
twelve
hours
before
i
could
get
it
taken
to
its
shallow
coffinless
grave
and
while
i
knelt
there
the
man
whose
wound
i
was
dressing
said
never
mind
we
make
you
up
a
good
purse
for
this
he
had
no
sooner
spoken
than
a
murmur
of
contemptuous
disapproval
came
from
the
other
men
and
one
said
a
purse
for
her
she
got
more
money
than
all
of
us
i
bet
another
called
out
no
we
wo
wo
do
anything
of
the
kind
we
your
boys
ai
we
mother
you
not
working
for
money
why
persisted
the
generous
man
we
made
up
a
purse
of
eighty
dollars
for
a
woman
t
other
time
i
was
hurt
and
she
had
done
half
as
much
for
us
eighty
dollars
called
out
the
man
who
thought
me
rich
eighty
dollars
for
her
why
i
tell
you
she
could
give
every
one
of
us
eighty
dollars
and
would
not
miss
it
another
said
she
is
one
of
the
sort
that
are
after
purses
why
any
of
them
should
have
thought
me
rich
i
can
not
imagine
except
for
the
respect
with
which
officers
treated
me
to
veil
the
iron
hand
i
held
over
my
nurses
i
made
a
jest
of
my
authority
pinned
a
bit
of
bandage
on
my
shoulder
and
played
officers
and
guards
would
salute
when
we
passed
as
an
innocent
joke
but
the
men
came
to
regard
me
as
a
person
of
rank
citizens
of
fredericksburg
who
at
first
insulted
me
on
the
street
as
they
did
other
yankee
nurses
heard
that
i
was
a
person
of
great
influence
and
began
to
solicit
my
good
offices
on
behalf
of
friends
arrested
by
order
of
secretary
stanton
and
held
as
hostages
for
our
sixty
wounded
who
were
made
prisoners
while
trying
to
pass
through
the
city
before
we
took
possession
so
i
was
decked
in
plumes
of
fictitious
greatness
and
might
have
played
princess
in
disguise
if
i
had
had
time
but
i
had
only
two
deaths
in
the
old
theater
this
man
up
stairs
and
the
man
without
clothes
who
lay
alone
in
that
back
room
and
after
the
amputation
of
his
thigh
had
no
covering
until
government
gave
him
one
of
virginia
clay
chapter
lxxii
more
victims
and
a
change
of
base
one
day
at
noon
the
air
thrilled
with
martial
music
and
the
earth
shook
under
the
tramp
of
men
as
seven
thousand
splendid
troops
marched
up
princess
ann
street
on
their
way
to
reinforce
our
army
whose
rear
was
about
eight
miles
from
us
they
were
in
superb
order
and
the
forts
around
washington
had
been
stripped
of
their
garrisons
and
most
of
their
guns
to
furnish
them
but
the
generalship
which
cut
our
army
off
from
its
base
of
supplies
and
blundered
into
the
battle
of
the
wilderness
like
a
blind
horse
into
a
briar
patch
without
shelling
or
burning
the
dry
chapperal
in
which
our
dead
and
wounded
were
consumed
together
after
the
battle
had
made
no
arrangements
for
the
safe
arrival
of
its
reinforcements
so
they
were
ambushed
soon
after
passing
through
fredericksburg
and
that
night
before
ten
all
the
places
i
had
succeeded
in
making
vacant
were
filled
with
the
wounded
from
this
reinforcement
how
many
of
them
were
brought
to
fredericksburg
i
do
not
know
but
it
must
have
been
a
good
many
when
some
were
sent
to
my
den
of
horrors
one
evening
after
dark
i
went
to
the
dispensary
and
found
a
surgeon
just
in
from
the
front
for
supplies
while
they
were
being
put
up
he
told
us
of
the
horrible
carnage
at
spottsylvania
that
day
when
the
troops
had
been
hurled
again
and
again
against
impregnable
fortifications
under
a
rain
of
rifle
balls
which
cut
down
a
solid
white
oak
tree
eighteen
inches
in
diameter
the
battle
had
ceased
for
the
night
and
it
was
not
known
whether
it
would
be
renewed
in
the
morning
but
if
it
is
said
the
speaker
it
will
be
the
bloodiest
day
of
the
war
and
we
must
be
whipped
routed
the
rebels
are
behind
breastworks
which
can
not
be
carried
any
man
but
grant
would
have
known
that
this
morning
but
he
is
to
fight
it
out
on
this
line
and
it
is
generally
thought
he
will
try
it
again
in
the
morning
if
he
does
it
will
be
a
worse
rout
than
bull
run
no
one
was
present
but
the
surgeon
in
charge
of
the
church
the
dispensary
clerk
and
myself
so
he
was
no
alarmist
for
when
he
had
done
speaking
he
took
his
package
mounted
his
horse
and
left
people
had
said
through
the
day
that
the
roar
of
guns
was
heard
in
the
higher
portions
of
the
city
but
no
news
of
the
battle
seemed
to
have
reached
it
during
all
the
next
day
i
spent
it
in
preparing
for
the
worst
warned
georgie
and
tightened
the
reins
on
my
nurses
i
had
had
no
reason
to
complain
of
any
and
felt
that
i
should
hold
them
to
duty
even
through
a
rout
it
also
seemed
well
to
know
where
our
wounded
were
located
in
that
part
of
the
city
so
that
if
an
attempt
were
made
to
remove
them
in
a
hurry
there
might
not
be
any
overlooked
at
eleven
that
night
i
had
heard
nothing
from
the
front
and
went
to
sleep
with
heavy
forebodings
at
two
i
was
aroused
by
the
sounds
of
a
moving
multitude
rose
and
looked
out
to
see
under
the
starlight
a
black
stream
pouring
down
the
side
street
on
the
corner
of
which
our
quarters
were
situated
and
turning
down
princess
ann
toward
the
river
landing
to
me
it
was
the
nation
going
to
her
doom
passing
through
the
little
period
of
starlight
on
into
the
darkness
and
the
unknown
in
louisville
i
had
learned
to
believe
that
the
eternal
verities
demanded
the
destruction
of
our
government
true
the
south
had
beaten
the
north
in
her
bloody
struggle
for
the
privilege
of
holding
her
slaves
while
she
flogged
them
but
i
could
see
in
this
no
reason
why
that
north
should
be
chosen
as
freedom
our
ignoble
emancipation
proclamation
had
furnished
no
rock
of
moral
principle
on
which
to
plant
her
feet
while
she
struggled
in
that
bloody
surf
god
was
blotting
out
our
name
from
among
the
nations
that
he
might
plant
here
a
government
worthy
of
such
a
country
i
calculated
there
was
a
rear
guard
that
would
hold
the
enemy
back
until
morning
and
did
not
wake
georgie
who
needed
sleep
but
i
must
be
with
my
men
who
would
be
alarmed
by
the
unusual
sounds
must
see
that
those
nurses
did
not
run
away
to
get
to
my
post
i
must
cross
that
stream
and
as
i
stood
waiting
on
the
bank
could
see
that
it
was
not
composed
of
men
in
martial
array
it
met
exactly
all
my
previous
conceptions
of
a
disorderly
flight
there
were
men
in
and
out
of
uniform
men
rolled
in
blankets
men
on
horseback
and
men
on
foot
cannon
caisons
baggage
wagons
beef
cattle
ambulances
and
nondescripts
all
mixed
and
mingled
filling
the
street
from
wall
to
wall
no
one
speaking
a
word
and
all
intent
on
getting
forward
as
fast
as
possible
so
thickly
were
they
packed
that
i
waited
in
vain
as
much
as
twenty
minutes
for
some
opening
through
which
i
might
work
my
way
to
the
other
side
and
at
last
called
the
vidette
who
came
and
helped
me
over
reaching
the
theater
i
found
many
of
the
men
awake
and
listening
went
among
them
and
whispered
as
i
did
something
for
each
that
there
was
some
movement
on
the
street
i
did
not
understand
but
should
probably
know
about
in
the
morning
during
the
suspense
of
those
dark
hours
and
all
the
next
day
i
was
constantly
reminded
of
the
bible
metaphor
of
a
nail
fastened
in
a
sure
place
the
absolute
confidence
which
those
men
reposed
in
me
the
comfort
and
strength
i
could
give
them
were
so
out
of
proportion
to
my
strength
that
it
was
a
study
i
was
a
very
small
nail
but
so
securely
fastened
in
the
source
of
all
strength
that
they
could
hold
by
me
and
hope
even
when
there
seemed
nothing
to
hope
for
as
for
me
all
the
armies
of
the
world
and
the
world
itself
might
melt
or
blow
away
but
i
should
be
safe
with
god
and
know
that
for
every
creature
he
was
working
out
some
noble
destiny
all
the
pain
and
sorrow
and
defeat
were
rough
places
briars
in
an
upward
path
to
something
we
should
all
rejoice
to
see
all
day
that
dark
stream
surged
around
that
corner
and
i
took
heart
that
the
flight
was
not
disorderly
since
i
heard
of
none
coming
by
any
other
street
all
day
the
work
went
on
as
usual
at
the
old
theater
and
i
made
short
excursions
to
other
places
up
that
street
in
one
end
of
an
engine
house
up
a
narrow
winding
stair
i
found
a
room
full
of
men
deserted
and
in
most
pitiable
condition
they
were
all
supposed
to
be
fever
cases
but
one
young
man
had
an
ankle
wound
in
which
inflammation
had
appeared
i
hurried
to
the
surgeons
stationed
in
the
far
end
of
the
building
and
reported
the
case
they
sent
immediately
for
the
man
and
i
knew
in
two
hours
that
the
amputation
had
been
successful
and
barely
in
time
as
i
went
on
that
errand
i
met
two
christian
commission
men
walking
leisurely
admiring
the
light
of
the
rising
sun
on
the
old
buildings
and
told
them
of
the
urgent
demand
for
help
and
chicken
broth
or
beef
broth
and
water
up
in
that
room
they
were
polite
and
promised
to
go
as
soon
as
possible
to
the
relief
of
that
distress
but
when
i
returned
and
up
to
the
last
knowledge
i
had
of
the
case
they
had
not
been
there
i
secured
a
can
of
cooked
turkey
the
only
one
i
ever
saw
and
a
pitcher
of
hot
water
and
with
these
made
a
substitute
for
chicken
broth
gave
them
all
drinks
of
water
bathed
their
faces
found
one
of
their
absent
nurses
made
him
promise
to
stay
and
went
back
to
the
main
building
to
have
some
one
see
that
he
kept
his
word
here
was
a
large
floor
almost
covered
with
wounded
and
among
them
a
woman
stumbled
about
weeping
wailing
and
wringing
her
hands
i
caught
her
wrist
and
said
what
the
matter
oh
oh
oh
the
poor
fellow
is
goin
to
die
an
wants
me
to
write
to
his
mother
well
write
to
her
and
keep
quiet
you
need
not
kill
all
the
rest
of
them
because
he
is
going
to
die
oh
some
people
has
no
feelin
but
i
have
got
feelin
i
led
her
to
the
surgeon
in
charge
who
sent
her
and
her
feelin
to
her
quarters
and
told
her
not
to
come
back
she
was
the
only
one
of
the
dix
nurses
i
saw
in
fredericksburg
and
her
large
flat
flabby
face
was
almost
hideous
with
its
lack
of
and
lashes
but
this
hideousness
must
have
been
her
recommendation
as
she
could
not
have
been
more
than
twenty
years
old
from
the
engine
house
i
went
to
the
methodist
church
miss
hancock
had
been
detailed
to
the
general
hospital
just
being
established
and
i
found
a
house
full
of
men
in
a
sad
condition
nine
on
a
hot
morning
and
no
wounds
dressed
bandages
dry
and
hard
men
thirsty
and
feverish
nurses
out
watching
that
stream
pouring
through
the
city
and
patients
helpless
and
despondent
i
got
a
basin
of
water
and
a
clean
rag
never
cared
for
sponges
and
went
from
one
to
another
dripping
water
in
behind
those
bandages
to
ease
the
torment
of
lint
splints
brought
drinks
and
talked
to
call
their
attention
from
the
indefinite
dread
which
filled
the
air
and
got
up
considerable
interest
in
i
do
not
remember
what
but
something
which
set
them
to
talking
some
wounds
i
dressed
and
while
engaged
on
one
a
man
called
from
the
other
side
of
the
house
to
know
what
the
fun
was
all
about
when
the
man
whose
wound
i
was
attending
placed
a
hand
on
each
of
his
sides
screamed
with
laughter
and
replied
oh
jim
do
get
her
to
dress
your
wound
for
i
swear
she
make
a
dead
man
laugh
i
found
some
of
the
nurses
a
surgeon
came
in
who
would
i
thought
attend
to
them
and
i
went
back
to
my
post
to
find
every
man
on
duty
it
was
near
sundown
when
we
heard
that
this
backward
movement
was
a
change
of
base
but
to
me
it
seemed
more
like
looking
for
a
base
as
there
had
been
none
to
change
the
stream
thickened
toward
nightfall
and
continued
until
two
next
morning
so
that
our
army
was
hours
passing
through
fredericksburg
and
in
that
time
i
do
not
think
a
man
strayed
off
on
to
any
other
street
all
poured
down
that
side
street
turned
that
corner
and
went
on
down
princess
ann
chapter
lxxiii
prayers
enough
and
to
spare
the
next
evening
after
hearing
of
the
battle
of
spottsylvania
and
while
waiting
to
know
if
it
had
been
renewed
i
sat
after
sundown
on
the
of
our
quarters
when
an
orderly
hurried
up
and
inquired
for
the
christian
commission
a
lieutenant
was
dying
and
wanted
to
see
a
preacher
i
directed
the
messenger
but
doubted
if
he
would
find
a
preacher
as
i
had
seen
nothing
of
any
save
a
catholic
priest
with
whom
i
had
formed
an
alliance
and
i
went
to
stay
with
the
dying
man
who
was
alone
i
found
him
nervous
and
tired
with
nothing
to
hinder
his
return
to
his
regiment
inside
of
a
month
he
had
been
converted
was
a
member
of
the
methodist
church
and
seemed
an
humble
christian
man
i
told
him
he
was
getting
well
had
seen
too
much
company
and
must
go
to
sleep
which
he
proceeded
to
do
in
a
very
short
time
after
being
assured
that
that
motion
was
in
order
he
had
slept
perhaps
five
minutes
when
the
messenger
returned
followed
by
six
preachers
i
made
a
sign
that
he
slept
and
should
not
be
disturbed
but
they
gathered
around
the
bed
with
so
much
noise
they
waked
him
there
seemed
to
be
a
struggle
for
precedence
among
his
visitors
but
one
gained
the
victory
they
all
wanted
to
shake
hands
with
the
man
in
the
bed
but
his
left
arm
was
off
and
i
objected
whereupon
the
head
spokesman
groaned
a
good
solid
groan
to
which
the
others
groaned
a
response
he
stood
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
spread
his
chest
and
inquired
well
brother
how
is
your
soul
in
this
solemn
hour
the
answer
was
such
as
a
good
christian
might
make
and
i
told
the
gentleman
that
the
lieutenant
had
been
unnecessarily
alarmed
that
he
had
seen
too
much
company
was
weary
and
excited
needed
rest
and
was
rapidly
recovering
that
he
ought
to
go
to
sleep
but
they
all
knelt
around
the
bed
and
the
first
prayed
a
good
long
loud
prayer
talked
about
the
lake
that
burneth
and
other
pleasant
things
while
i
held
the
patient
hand
and
felt
his
nerves
jerk
i
thought
it
would
soon
be
over
but
no
sooner
had
this
one
finished
than
the
next
fell
to
and
gave
us
a
prayer
with
more
of
those
sobs
made
by
hard
inhalation
than
his
predecessor
and
a
good
deal
more
brimstone
no
sooner
had
he
relieved
his
mind
than
a
third
threw
back
his
head
to
begin
and
i
spoke
quietly
as
possible
begged
they
would
let
the
lieutenant
sleep
told
them
that
down
in
the
old
theater
was
a
man
in
a
back
room
alone
and
dying
i
had
tried
to
get
some
one
to
sit
with
him
and
pray
with
him
and
hoped
one
or
two
of
them
would
go
to
him
at
once
as
every
moment
might
make
it
too
late
a
man
was
also
dying
in
the
who
ought
to
have
some
christian
friend
with
him
as
he
crossed
the
dark
valley
they
listened
impatiently
then
the
man
whose
turn
it
was
to
ventilate
his
eloquence
pushed
his
sleeves
up
to
the
elbows
rubbed
his
hands
as
if
about
to
lift
some
heavy
weight
and
exclaimed
yes
sister
yes
we
attend
to
them
but
first
let
us
get
through
with
this
case
then
he
went
to
work
and
ladled
out
groans
sobs
and
blue
blazes
the
other
three
followed
suit
and
when
they
had
all
had
a
good
time
on
their
knees
each
one
gave
a
short
oration
and
when
they
got
through
i
reminded
them
again
of
the
two
dying
men
but
like
the
undutiful
son
they
said
i
go
and
went
not
it
was
two
of
the
six
whom
i
met
next
morning
and
asked
to
go
to
the
relief
of
those
poor
patients
who
promised
and
went
not
chapter
lxxiv
get
out
of
the
old
theater
i
do
not
know
how
long
i
was
in
charge
of
the
old
theater
but
remember
talking
to
some
one
of
having
been
there
ten
days
and
things
looking
as
usual
it
was
after
the
change
of
base
that
one
afternoon
i
got
eight
hopeful
cases
sent
to
the
general
hospital
where
they
would
have
beds
that
night
about
ten
the
vidette
halted
a
man
who
explained
that
he
was
surgeon
in
charge
of
that
institution
and
when
he
got
leave
to
go
on
i
caught
him
by
the
lapel
of
his
coat
and
said
if
you
are
surgeon
what
is
the
reason
that
the
eight
men
i
sent
you
this
afternoon
had
had
no
supper
at
nine
he
promised
to
attend
to
them
before
he
slept
and
on
that
we
parted
soon
after
this
childs
of
philadelphia
and
a
regular
army
surgeon
came
to
the
old
theater
hung
their
coats
and
official
dignity
if
they
had
any
on
the
wall
never
said
a
word
about
the
rubbish
in
the
hall
but
fastened
up
their
sleeves
and
went
to
work
when
they
came
i
felt
as
if
i
could
not
take
another
step
went
to
my
room
and
lay
down
thinking
of
raphael
useless
angels
leaning
their
baby
arms
on
a
cloud
my
angels
wore
beards
and
had
their
sleeves
turned
up
like
farm
laborers
as
they
lifted
men
out
of
the
depths
of
despair
into
the
light
and
warmth
of
human
help
and
human
sympathy
in
sending
the
men
away
they
sent
the
amputation
cases
and
george
to
the
church
and
sent
for
me
to
go
to
them
there
georgie
had
gone
to
the
general
hospital
and
there
was
no
surgeon
in
charge
at
the
church
when
i
went
to
it
so
once
more
i
set
about
doing
that
which
was
right
in
my
own
eyes
i
could
have
a
bale
of
hay
whipped
out
my
needle
and
thread
and
for
several
bad
cases
who
had
two
blankets
converted
one
into
a
bed
tick
had
it
filled
with
hay
and
a
man
placed
on
it
but
three
were
sadly
in
need
of
beds
and
had
no
blankets
and
to
them
i
alloted
the
balance
of
my
precious
bale
had
it
placed
under
them
loose
and
rejoiced
in
their
joy
over
so
great
a
luxury
my
theater
men
had
been
laid
in
a
row
close
to
the
wall
next
to
the
late
scene
of
their
suffering
and
about
midnight
of
the
first
night
there
a
nurse
asked
me
to
go
to
a
man
who
was
dying
i
found
him
in
front
of
the
altar
the
doors
and
front
panels
of
the
pews
had
been
fastened
v
shape
to
the
floor
and
he
lay
with
one
arm
over
this
and
his
head
hanging
forward
he
had
been
shot
through
the
chest
was
breathing
loud
and
in
gasps
worn
out
for
want
of
support
and
to
lay
him
down
was
to
put
out
his
lamp
of
life
instantly
what
he
needed
was
a
chair
but
general
patrick
sense
of
duty
to
the
citizens
of
fredericksburg
left
no
hope
of
such
a
support
as
the
only
substitute
in
my
reach
i
sat
on
the
edge
of
the
pew
door
and
its
panel
drew
his
arm
across
my
knee
raised
his
head
to
my
shoulder
and
held
it
there
by
laying
mine
against
it
in
this
way
i
could
talk
in
a
low
monotone
to
him
and
the
hopes
to
which
the
soul
turns
when
about
to
leave
the
tenement
of
clay
he
gasped
acquiescence
in
these
hopes
and
his
words
led
several
men
near
to
draw
their
sleeves
across
their
eyes
but
they
all
knew
he
was
dying
and
a
little
sympathy
and
sadness
would
not
injure
them
he
reached
toward
the
floor
and
the
man
next
handed
up
a
daguerreotype
case
which
he
tried
to
open
i
took
and
opened
it
found
the
picture
of
a
young
handsome
woman
and
held
it
and
a
candle
so
that
he
could
see
it
his
tears
fell
on
it
as
he
looked
and
he
gasped
i
shall
never
be
where
that
has
been
i
said
is
it
your
wife
and
he
replied
no
but
she
would
have
been
i
always
tried
to
avoid
bringing
sadness
to
the
living
on
account
of
death
but
it
must
have
been
hard
for
men
to
sleep
in
sound
of
his
labored
breathing
and
to
soften
it
i
began
singing
shining
shore
he
took
it
up
at
once
in
a
whisper
tone
keeping
time
as
if
used
to
singing
soon
one
then
another
and
another
joined
until
all
over
the
church
these
prostrate
men
were
singing
that
soft
sad
melody
on
the
altar
burned
a
row
of
candles
before
a
picture
of
the
virgin
and
child
the
cocks
crew
the
turn
of
the
night
outside
and
when
we
had
sung
the
hymn
through
some
of
the
men
began
again
and
we
had
sung
it
a
second
time
when
i
heard
george
call
me
i
knew
that
he
too
was
dying
and
would
probably
not
hear
the
next
crowing
of
the
cock
i
must
go
to
him
how
could
i
leave
this
head
unsupported
oh
death
where
is
thy
sting
i
think
it
was
with
me
that
night
but
i
went
to
george
and
when
the
sun
arose
it
looked
upon
two
corpses
the
remains
of
two
who
had
gone
from
my
arms
in
one
night
full
of
hope
in
the
great
hereafter
chapter
lxxv
take
boat
and
see
a
social
party
next
morning
a
new
surgeon
took
charge
and
ordered
that
hay
to
be
removed
the
men
clung
to
their
beds
and
sent
for
me
i
plead
a
respite
in
hopes
of
getting
muslin
to
make
ticks
but
was
soon
detected
in
the
act
of
taking
a
bowl
of
broth
to
one
of
my
patients
this
the
surgeon
forbade
on
the
ground
that
it
was
not
regular
meal
time
i
said
the
man
was
asleep
at
meal
time
this
he
would
not
permit
men
must
be
fed
at
regular
hours
or
not
at
all
and
the
new
authority
informed
me
that
more
wounded
soldiers
had
been
killed
by
women
stuffing
them
than
by
anything
else
he
had
just
come
from
massachusetts
and
this
was
his
first
day
among
the
wounded
i
set
my
bowl
down
before
the
altar
found
a
surgeon
who
ranked
him
and
stated
the
case
when
the
higher
authority
said
give
every
man
an
ox
every
day
if
he
will
take
it
in
beef
tea
but
doctor
there
is
nothing
in
beef
tea
i
give
broth
very
good
give
them
whatever
you
please
and
whenever
you
please
we
can
trust
you
the
new
surgeon
was
promptly
dismissed
and
when
next
i
saw
him
he
was
on
his
way
back
to
massachusetts
that
night
a
nurse
came
for
me
to
go
to
the
theater
which
had
been
vacated
and
once
more
almost
filled
with
men
who
lay
in
total
darkness
without
having
any
provision
made
for
them
i
got
them
lights
nurses
and
food
but
could
not
go
back
for
another
siege
in
that
building
could
not
leave
my
present
post
but
the
city
was
being
evacuated
both
theater
and
church
were
emptied
and
i
went
to
the
tobacco
warehouse
where
ingersol
was
perplexed
about
a
man
with
a
large
bullet
in
his
brain
when
i
had
seen
him
and
assured
her
that
another
ounce
of
lead
in
a
skull
of
that
kind
was
of
no
consequence
she
redoubled
her
care
and
i
have
no
doubt
he
is
living
yet
but
there
was
one
man
in
whom
i
felt
a
deep
interest
and
for
whom
i
saw
little
hope
he
had
a
chest
wound
and
had
seemed
to
be
doing
well
when
there
was
a
hemorrhage
and
he
lay
white
and
still
almost
as
death
he
must
not
attempt
to
speak
and
i
was
a
godsend
to
him
for
i
knew
what
he
needed
without
being
told
and
gave
him
the
best
care
i
could
he
was
of
a
western
state
and
his
name
dutton
and
when
i
left
him
i
thought
he
must
die
in
being
moved
as
he
must
be
soon
but
i
must
go
with
a
of
wounded
this
boat
was
a
mere
transport
and
its
precious
freight
was
laid
on
the
decks
as
close
as
they
could
well
be
packed
the
cabin
floor
being
given
up
to
the
wounded
officers
there
were
several
surgeons
on
board
who
may
have
been
attending
to
the
men
but
can
not
remember
seeing
any
but
one
engaged
in
any
work
of
that
kind
there
were
also
seven
lady
nurses
all
i
think
volunteers
all
handsomely
if
not
elegantly
dressed
of
course
they
could
do
nothing
there
and
i
can
not
see
how
they
could
have
done
anything
among
the
wounded
in
any
place
where
there
were
no
bedsteads
to
protect
the
men
from
their
hoops
they
had
probably
been
engaged
in
preparing
food
taking
charge
of
and
distributing
supplies
and
other
important
work
for
personal
attendance
on
the
men
was
but
a
part
of
the
work
to
be
done
surgeons
could
do
little
without
soiling
their
uniforms
but
my
dress
had
long
been
past
soiling
or
spoiling
my
old
kid
slippers
without
heels
could
be
slid
with
the
feet
in
them
quite
under
a
man
and
as
i
stepped
sideways
across
them
they
took
care
that
my
soft
dress
did
not
catch
on
their
buttons
when
i
sat
on
one
heel
to
bathe
a
hot
face
give
a
drink
or
dress
a
wound
some
man
took
hold
of
me
with
his
well
hand
and
steadied
me
while
another
held
my
basin
i
had
half
of
an
old
knapsack
to
put
under
a
wound
keep
the
floor
dry
and
catch
the
worms
when
i
drove
them
out
and
no
twenty
early
birds
ever
captured
so
many
in
the
same
length
of
time
i
became
so
eager
in
the
pursuit
that
i
kept
it
up
by
until
late
midnight
when
i
started
to
go
to
my
stateroom
entering
the
cabin
i
came
upon
a
social
party
the
like
of
which
i
trust
no
one
else
will
ever
see
on
the
sofas
sat
those
seven
lady
nurses
each
with
the
arm
of
an
officer
around
her
waist
in
full
view
of
the
wounded
men
on
the
floor
some
of
whom
must
go
from
that
low
bed
to
one
still
lower
even
down
under
the
daisies
i
stopped
uttered
some
exclamation
then
stood
in
speechless
surprise
three
surgeons
released
the
ladies
they
were
holding
came
forward
and
inquired
if
there
was
anything
wanted
i
might
have
replied
that
men
and
women
were
wanted
but
think
i
said
nothing
when
i
reached
my
room
i
found
in
the
berth
a
woman
who
raised
up
and
said
the
stewardess
told
me
this
was
your
room
will
you
let
me
stay
with
you
she
was
another
georgie
young
calm
strong
refined
was
miss
gray
of
columbia
hospital
and
staid
with
me
through
a
long
hard
trial
in
which
she
proved
that
her
price
was
above
rubies
next
morning
i
found
on
one
of
the
guards
young
johnson
the
son
of
an
old
wilkinsburg
schoolmate
hoped
i
had
so
checked
the
decay
and
final
destroyers
which
had
already
taken
hold
of
him
that
he
might
live
wrote
to
his
people
and
saw
him
at
noon
transferred
with
the
other
patients
the
surgeons
and
stylish
lady
nurses
to
a
large
hospital
boat
when
miss
gray
and
i
returned
in
the
transport
to
fredericksburg
chapter
lxxvi
take
final
leave
of
fredericksburg
i
can
not
remember
if
our
boat
lay
at
the
fredericksburg
wharf
one
day
or
two
but
she
might
start
any
moment
and
those
who
went
ashore
took
the
risk
of
being
left
as
this
was
the
last
boat
the
evacuation
was
almost
complete
and
we
waited
the
result
of
expeditions
to
gather
up
our
wounded
from
field
hospitals
at
the
front
we
were
liable
to
attack
at
any
moment
and
were
protected
by
a
gunboat
which
lay
close
along
side
there
was
plenty
to
do
on
board
but
in
doing
it
i
must
see
the
piles
of
stores
on
the
wharf
brought
there
too
late
to
be
of
service
to
our
wounded
and
now
to
be
abandoned
to
the
rebels
there
were
certainly
one
hundred
bales
of
hay
which
would
have
more
than
replaced
all
that
was
withheld
by
united
states
bayonets
from
our
own
men
in
their
extremity
i
soon
learned
after
entering
fredericksburg
that
our
commissaries
were
issuing
stores
without
stint
to
the
citizens
went
and
saw
them
carry
off
loads
of
everything
there
was
to
give
and
when
those
one
hundred
and
union
soldiers
were
literally
starving
in
the
old
theater
union
soldiers
were
dealing
out
delicacies
to
rebels
while
others
guarded
the
meanest
article
of
their
property
and
kept
it
from
our
men
even
when
it
was
necessary
to
save
life
i
consulted
several
old
sanitary
commission
men
who
told
me
it
was
always
so
when
grant
was
at
the
front
that
he
was
then
in
absolute
command
that
patrick
the
provost
marshal
was
his
friend
and
would
be
sustained
and
that
we
must
be
quiet
or
we
would
be
ordered
out
of
fredericksburg
grant
may
have
been
loyal
to
the
union
cause
but
it
has
always
seemed
to
me
that
in
fighting
its
battles
he
was
moved
by
the
pure
love
of
fighting
and
took
that
side
which
could
furnish
him
the
most
means
to
gratify
his
passion
for
war
his
generalship
was
certainly
of
a
kind
that
would
soon
have
proved
fatal
to
our
cause
in
the
war
of
the
revolution
and
only
succeeded
in
the
war
of
the
rebellion
because
the
resources
at
his
command
were
limitless
as
compared
with
those
of
the
enemy
it
was
late
in
the
afternoon
when
our
boat
shoved
off
and
as
we
steamed
away
we
saw
the
citizens
rush
down
and
take
possession
of
the
stores
left
on
the
wharf
during
the
evening
and
night
we
were
fired
into
several
times
from
the
shores
but
these
attacks
were
returned
from
the
which
kept
our
assailants
at
such
distance
that
their
shots
were
harmless
we
must
have
no
lights
that
night
and
the
fires
were
put
out
or
concealed
that
they
might
not
make
us
a
target
so
i
slept
as
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
but
in
the
morning
was
out
early
in
search
of
worms
and
was
having
good
success
when
two
richly
fashionably
dressed
ladies
came
to
tell
me
there
was
to
be
nothing
to
eat
save
for
those
who
took
board
at
the
captain
table
they
had
gone
to
the
kitchen
to
make
a
cup
of
tea
for
a
wounded
officer
and
were
ignominiously
driven
off
by
the
cook
what
was
to
be
done
we
might
be
ten
days
getting
to
washington
i
went
in
search
of
a
surgeon
in
charge
and
found
one
in
bed
sick
waited
at
his
door
until
he
joined
me
when
together
we
saw
the
captain
of
the
boat
there
were
two
new
on
board
but
to
put
one
up
would
be
to
forfeit
the
insurance
there
were
plenty
of
commissary
stores
the
surgeon
went
with
me
ordered
the
commissary
to
give
me
anything
i
wanted
and
went
back
to
bed
our
stores
consisted
of
crackers
coffee
essence
of
beef
and
salt
pork
in
abundance
a
little
loaf
bread
and
about
half
a
pound
of
citric
acid
of
these
only
the
crackers
and
bread
could
be
eaten
without
being
cooked
there
were
four
hundred
and
fifty
wounded
men
all
bad
cases
all
exhausted
from
privation
how
many
of
them
would
live
to
reach
washington
on
a
diet
of
crackers
and
water
i
went
to
the
cook
a
large
sensible
colored
woman
and
stated
the
case
as
well
as
i
could
after
hearing
it
she
said
i
see
how
it
is
but
you
see
all
these
officers
and
ladies
are
agoin
to
board
with
the
captain
an
i
have
a
sight
o
cooking
to
do
i
have
none
of
those
fine
ladies
comin
a
botherin
around
me
off
my
things
or
upsettin
but
i
tell
you
what
i
do
hurry
up
my
work
and
clare
off
my
things
then
you
can
have
the
kitchen
you
an
that
young
lady
that
with
you
but
them
women
with
their
hoops
an
their
flounces
must
stay
out
o
here
it
was
hard
to
see
how
two
of
them
would
get
into
that
small
domain
a
kitchen
about
ten
feet
square
half
filled
by
a
shelves
and
the
steep
narrow
open
stairs
which
led
to
the
upper
deck
but
what
a
kingdom
that
little
kitchen
was
to
me
all
the
utensils
leaked
but
cook
helped
me
draw
rags
through
the
holes
in
the
three
largest
which
i
was
to
have
and
which
covered
the
top
of
the
stove
there
were
plenty
of
new
wooden
buckets
and
tin
dippers
on
board
as
freight
some
contraband
women
and
an
active
little
man
who
had
once
been
a
cook
assistant
he
and
the
women
were
glad
to
work
for
food
he
was
to
help
me
in
the
kitchen
they
worked
outside
and
must
not
get
in
the
way
of
the
crew
they
washed
dried
apples
and
put
them
to
soak
in
buckets
pounded
crackers
in
bags
and
put
the
crumbs
into
buckets
making
each
one
a
third
full
and
covering
them
with
cold
water
i
put
a
large
piece
of
salt
pork
into
my
largest
boiler
added
water
and
beef
essence
enough
to
almost
fill
the
boiler
seasoned
it
and
as
soon
as
it
reached
boiling
point
had
it
ladled
into
the
buckets
with
the
and
sent
for
distribution
the
second
boiler
was
kept
busy
cooking
dried
apples
into
which
i
put
citric
acid
and
sugar
for
gangrene
prevailed
among
the
wounds
in
the
third
boiler
i
made
coffee
i
kept
it
and
as
soon
as
it
boiled
i
put
it
strong
into
buckets
full
of
cold
water
i
kept
vessels
in
the
oven
and
on
the
small
spaces
on
top
of
the
stove
my
little
man
fired
up
like
a
another
man
laid
plenty
of
wood
at
hand
and
i
think
that
was
the
only
that
was
ever
run
to
its
full
capacity
for
a
week
by
so
running
it
i
could
give
every
man
a
pint
of
warm
soup
and
one
of
warm
coffee
every
hours
to
do
this
everything
must
come
to
time
when
one
piece
of
pork
was
cooked
it
was
cut
into
small
pieces
and
distributed
and
another
put
into
the
boiler
during
our
cooking
times
i
usually
sat
on
the
stairs
where
i
could
direct
and
be
out
of
the
way
and
to
improve
the
time
often
had
a
plate
and
cup
from
which
i
ate
and
drank
cook
always
saved
me
something
nice
and
i
made
tea
for
myself
i
was
running
my
body
as
i
did
the
cook
stove
making
it
do
quadruple
duty
and
did
not
spare
the
fuel
in
either
case
around
each
foot
below
the
instep
i
had
a
broad
firm
bandage
one
above
each
ankle
and
one
below
each
knee
if
soldiers
on
the
march
had
adopted
this
precaution
they
would
have
escaped
the
swollen
limbs
so
often
distressing
i
also
had
each
knee
covered
by
several
layers
of
red
flannel
to
protect
them
while
i
knelt
on
damp
places
soon
after
going
into
campbell
i
discovered
that
muscles
around
the
bone
will
do
double
service
if
held
firmly
in
place
and
so
was
enabled
in
all
my
hospital
work
to
do
what
seemed
miraculous
to
the
most
experienced
surgeons
i
rested
every
moment
i
could
never
stood
when
i
might
sit
made
no
useless
motions
spent
no
strength
in
sorrow
had
no
sentiment
was
simply
the
engineer
of
a
machine
my
own
body
could
fall
asleep
soon
as
i
lay
down
and
wake
any
moment
with
my
senses
all
alert
outlived
my
prejudice
about
china
cups
and
drank
tea
from
brown
earthen
mugs
used
for
soup
and
never
washed
save
in
cold
water
often
ate
from
a
tin
plate
with
my
left
hand
while
my
right
held
a
stump
to
prevent
that
jerking
of
the
nerves
which
is
so
agonizing
to
the
patient
many
a
time
eating
from
the
same
tin
plate
with
my
patient
and
making
merry
over
it
and
think
i
must
have
outstanding
engagements
to
dance
cotillions
with
one
hundred
men
one
day
while
i
sat
eating
and
watching
that
just
enough
cans
of
beef
were
put
into
each
boiler
of
broth
and
no
time
wasted
by
letting
it
stand
after
reaching
boiling
point
a
surgeon
asked
to
see
me
at
the
kitchen
door
he
informed
me
that
up
on
the
forecastle
some
men
had
had
soup
twice
while
those
in
some
other
place
had
had
none
he
evidently
wished
to
be
lenient
but
felt
that
i
had
been
guilty
of
great
neglect
i
heard
his
grievance
and
said
doctor
how
many
of
you
surgeons
are
on
this
boat
after
some
consideration
he
answered
four
four
surgeons
i
repeated
beside
the
surgeon
in
charge
who
is
sick
we
have
four
hundred
and
fifty
wounded
men
i
draw
all
the
rations
find
a
way
to
cook
them
have
them
cooked
and
put
into
the
buckets
ready
for
distribution
do
you
not
think
that
you
four
could
organize
a
force
to
see
that
they
are
honestly
distributed
or
do
you
expect
me
to
be
in
the
kitchen
up
in
the
forecastle
and
at
the
stern
on
the
boiler
deck
at
one
and
the
same
time
doctor
could
you
not
take
turns
in
amusing
those
ladies
could
they
not
spare
two
of
you
for
duty
i
heard
no
more
complaints
but
left
miss
grey
more
in
charge
of
the
kitchen
and
did
enough
medical
inspecting
to
know
that
i
had
been
unjust
some
of
the
surgeons
had
been
on
duty
and
the
men
were
not
so
much
neglected
as
i
had
feared
as
for
the
ladies
i
do
not
know
how
many
there
were
of
them
but
they
were
of
good
social
position
quite
as
good
as
the
average
of
those
whose
main
object
in
life
is
to
look
as
much
better
than
their
neighbors
as
circumstances
will
admit
there
was
on
board
one
of
those
folks
for
whose
existence
christianity
is
responsible
and
which
sensible
hindoos
reduce
to
their
original
elements
viz
a
widow
who
gets
a
living
by
being
pious
and
is
respectable
through
sheer
force
of
cheap
finery
one
who
estimates
herself
by
her
surroundings
and
whose
every
word
and
look
and
motion
is
an
apology
for
her
existence
she
was
a
dix
or
paid
nurse
the
ladies
snubbed
her
we
had
no
room
for
her
hoops
and
she
spent
her
time
in
odd
corners
taking
care
of
them
and
her
hair
and
turning
up
her
eyes
like
a
duck
in
a
under
the
impression
that
it
looked
devotional
if
i
had
killed
all
the
folks
i
have
felt
like
killing
she
would
have
gone
from
that
boat
to
her
final
rest
one
night
about
eleven
a
strange
surgeon
who
had
just
come
aboard
with
twenty
wounded
came
to
the
kitchen
door
and
handed
in
a
requisition
for
tea
and
custard
and
chicken
for
his
men
the
man
told
him
he
could
have
nothing
but
or
coffee
he
was
very
indignant
and
proceeded
to
get
up
a
scene
but
the
man
said
firmly
ca
help
it
surgeon
that
the
orders
orders
whose
orders
i
got
down
from
my
porch
on
the
stairs
came
forward
and
said
it
is
my
orders
sir
and
i
am
sorry
but
this
is
really
all
we
can
do
for
you
if
your
men
have
tin
cups
each
one
can
have
a
cup
of
warm
soup
it
will
not
be
very
hot
or
a
cup
of
warm
coffee
those
who
get
soup
will
get
no
coffee
and
those
who
get
coffee
can
have
no
soup
you
can
get
tin
cups
from
the
commissary
and
should
have
them
ready
so
that
the
food
will
not
cool
while
i
made
this
statement
he
stood
regarding
me
with
ineffable
disdain
and
when
i
was
through
inquired
who
are
you
i
am
the
cook
the
cook
he
repeated
contemptuously
i
will
report
your
insolence
when
we
reach
washington
that
may
be
your
duty
but
i
will
send
up
the
coffee
and
soup
and
do
you
get
the
tin
cups
he
stamped
off
in
dudgeon
and
others
who
heard
him
were
highly
indignant
but
i
was
greatly
pleased
to
find
a
surgeon
who
would
get
angry
and
raise
a
disturbance
on
behalf
of
his
patients
i
never
knew
his
name
but
if
this
should
meet
his
eye
i
trust
he
will
accept
my
thanks
for
his
faithfulness
to
his
charge
on
the
lower
deck
behind
the
boilers
lay
twenty
wounded
prisoners
who
at
first
looked
sulky
but
as
i
was
stepping
over
and
among
them
one
caught
my
dress
looked
up
pleadingly
and
said
mother
ca
you
get
me
some
soft
bread
i
ca
eat
this
he
was
young
scarce
more
than
a
boy
had
large
dark
eyes
a
good
head
tokens
of
gentle
nurture
and
alas
a
thigh
stump
he
told
me
he
was
of
a
mississippi
regiment
and
his
name
willie
gibbs
i
bathed
his
hot
face
and
said
i
would
see
about
the
bread
then
went
to
another
part
of
the
deck
where
our
men
were
very
closely
packed
and
stated
the
case
to
them
there
was
very
little
soft
bread
it
was
theirs
by
right
what
should
i
do
i
think
they
all
spoke
at
once
and
all
said
the
same
words
oh
mother
give
the
johnnies
the
soft
bread
we
can
eat
i
think
i
was
impartial
but
there
was
a
temptation
to
give
willie
gibbs
a
little
more
than
his
share
of
attention
his
face
was
so
sad
and
there
was
so
little
hope
that
he
would
ever
again
see
those
who
loved
him
that
i
think
i
did
more
for
him
than
for
any
other
one
on
board
his
companions
came
to
call
me
mother
and
i
hope
felt
their
captivity
softened
by
my
care
and
often
rebel
hands
supported
me
while
i
crouched
at
work
when
we
approached
washington
i
proposed
rewarding
the
cook
for
the
incalculable
service
she
had
rendered
but
she
replied
no
i
will
not
take
anything
from
you
that
apron
when
we
get
to
washington
you
will
not
want
it
any
more
an
i
keep
it
all
my
life
to
remember
you
and
leave
it
to
my
children

another
lady
in
the

could
done
what
you
done

know
you
a
lady
them

with
the
fine

pass
for

but
lord
i
know
no

up

way
in

know
it

look

you

her
southern

whatever
supremacy
the

may
have
over
the

southern
ladies
are
far
in
advance
of
those
of
the
north
in
the
art
of
dress
a
southern
lady
seldom
commits
an
incongruity
or
fails
to
dress
according
to
age
weather
and
the
occasion
i
do
not
think
any
one
of
any
social
standing
would
have
gone
among
wounded
men
with
the
idea
of
rendering
any
assistance
tricked
out
in
finery
as
hundreds
if
not
thousands
of
respectable
northern
women
did
the
apron
which
i
gave
to
my
friend
the
cook
was
brown
gingham
had
seen
hard
service
and
cost
originally
ten
cents
and
half
an
but
if
it
aids
her
to
remember
me
as
pleasantly
as
i
do
her
it
is
part

a

try
to
get
up
a
society
and
get
sick
after
two
days
in
bed
at
home
i
was
so
much
better
that
when
ingersol
came
with
a
plan
for
organizing
a
society
to
furnish
the
army
with
female
nurses
i
went
to
see
lincoln
about
it
she
was
willing
to
cooperate
and
i
went
to
secretary
stanton
who
heard
me
and
replied
you
must
know
that
barlow
and
ingersol
and
you
are
not
fair
representatives
of
your
sex
and
went
on
to
explain
the
embarrassment
of
the
from
the
thousands
of
women
pressing
their
services
upon
the
government
and
the
various
political
influences
brought
to
bear
on
behalf
of
applicants
and
of
the
well
grounded
opposition
of
surgeons
to
the
presence
of
women
in
hospitals
on
account
of
their
general
unfitness
scott
as
a
personal
friend
of
miss
dix
had
appointed
her
to
the
place
she
held
and
it
was
so
convenient
and
respectful
to
refer
people
to
her
that
the
war
department
would
not
interfere
with
the
arrangement
in
other
words
she
was
a
against
which
feminine
sympathies
could
dash
and
splash
without
submerging
the
hospital
service
after
what
i
had
seen
among
the
women
who
had
succeeded
in
getting
in
i
had
not
much
to
say
a
society
might
prescribe
a
dress
but
might
be
no
more
successful
than
miss
dix
in
making
selections
of
those
who
should
wear
it
i
asked
the
secretary
how
it
came
that
no
better
provision
had
been
made
for
our
wounded
after
the
battle
of
the
wilderness
and
tears
sprang
to
his
eyes
as
he
replied
we
did
not
know
where
they
were
we
had
made
every
arrangement
at
the
points
designated
by
grant
but
he
changed
his
plans
and
did
not
notify
us
the
whole
army
was
cut
off
from
its
base
of
supplies
and
must
be
sustained
as
soon
as
we
knew
the
emergency
we
did
everything
in
our
power
but
all
our
preparations
were
lost
everything
had
to
be
done
over
again
you
can
not
regret
the
suffering
more
than
i
but
it
was
impossible
for
me
to
prevent
it
i
never
saw
him
so
earnest
so
sorrowful
so
deeply
moved
that
effort
seemed
to
be
the
straw
which
broke
the
camel
back
and
i
was
so
ill
as
to
demand
medical
attendance
for
this
i
sent
to
campbell
kelly
came
but
his
forte
was
surgery
and
my
case
was
left
with
dr
true
who
had
had
longer
practice
in
medicine
they
both
decided
that
i
had
been
inoculated
with
gangrene
while
dressing
wounds
and
for
some
weeks
i
continued
to
sink
i
began
to
think
my
illness
fatal
and
asked
the
doctor
who
said
i
have
been
thinking
i
ought
to
tell
you
that
if
you
have
any
unsettled
business
you
should
attend
to
it
i
had
a
feeling
of
being
generally
distributed
over
the
bed
of
being
a
mass
of
pulp
without
any
central
force
but
i
had
had
a
letter
that
day
from
my
daughter
who
was
with
her
father
and
grandmother
in
swissvale
and
wanted
to
come
to
me
and
the
thought
came
does
god
mean
to
make
my
child
an
orphan
that
others
may
receive
their
children
by
my
death
then
i
had
a
strange
sensation
of
a
muster
a
gathering
of
scattered
and
when
it
all
came
together
it
made
a
protest
i
signed
to
the
doctor
who
put
his
ear
to
my
lips
and
i
said
doctor
true
i
shall
live
to
be
an
hundred
and
twenty
years
old
he
took
up
the
lamp
threw
the
light
on
my
face
and
peered
anxiously
into
it
and
i
looked
straight
into
his
eyes
and
said
i
will
he
laughed
and
set
down
the
lamp
saying
then
you
must
get
over
this
you
must
get
me
over
it
bring
dr
kelly
next
morning
i
had
them
carry
me
into
a
larger
room
where
the
morning
sun
shone
on
me
and
ten
days
after
started
for
pennsylvania
where
i
spent
three
weeks
with
my
old
swissvale
neighbors
hawkins
and
wm
haven
when
i
returned
to
washington
i
found
an
official
document
a
recommendation
from
the
general
of
my
dismissal
for
absence
without
leave
it
was
addressed
to
secretary
stanton
who
had
written
on
the
outside
respectfully
referred
to
swisshelm
by
edwin
m
stanton
i
went
back
to
work
and
learned
that
barlow
had
died
of
typhoid
fever
in
washington
no
man
died
more
directly
for

thousands
who
fell
on

exhibited
less

to
that
service
and
did
less
to
secure
its
success
i
know
not
where
her
body
lies
but
wherever
it
does
no
should
pass
in
which
her
memory
is
not
crowned
with
immortelles
she
died
at
a
time
when
my
life
was
despaired
of
and
when
ingersol
wrote
to
a
maine
paper
of
my
illness
adding
i
hope
the

will
not
take
her
away
until
he
has
made
another
like
her
she
told
me
afterwards
that
just
then
she
held
the
world
at
a
grudge
but
it
must
have
been
relieved
of
my
presence
long
ere
this
if
i
had
not
found
in
homoepathy
relief
from
pain
which
for
eight
months
made
life
a

which
the

the
history

one
while
i
lay
ill
a
friend
came
and
told
of
a
most
excellent
woman
who
had
come
from
afar
and
tendered
her
services
to
the
government
who
had
exerted
much
influence
and
spent
much
effort
to
get
into
a
hospital
as
nurse
but
had
failed
hearing
of
my
illness
her
desire
to
be
useful
led
her
to
tender
her
services
so
that
if
she
could
not
nurse
wounded
soldiers
she
could
nurse
one
who
had
the
generous
offer
was
accepted
and
i
was
left
an
afternoon
in
her
care
i
wanted
a
cup
of
tea
she
went
to
the
kitchen
to
make
it
and
one
hour
after
came
up
with
a
cup
of
tea
only
this
and
nothing
more
save
a
saucer
to
taste
the
tea
i
must
have
a
spoon
and
to
get
one
she
must
go
along
a
hall
down
a
long
flight
of
stairs
through
another
hall
and
the
kitchen
to
the
pantry
when
she
had
made
the
trip
the
tea
was
so
much
too
strong
that
a
spoonful
would
have
made
a
cup
she
went
down
again
for
hot
water
and
after
she
had
got
to
the
kitchen
remembered
that
she
had
thrown
it
out
thinking
it
would
not
be
wanted
the
fire
had
gone
out
and
she
came
up
to
inquire
if
she
should
make
a
new
one
and
if
so
where
she
should
find
kindling
she
had
spent
almost
two
hours
running
to
and
fro
was
all
in
perspiration
and
a
fluster
had
done
me
a
great
deal
of
harm
and
nobody
any

had
wasted
all

two
fredericksburg
patients
some
months
after
leaving
fredericksburg
i
was
walking
on
pennsylvania
avenue
when
the
setting
sun
shone
in
my
face
and
a
man
in
uniform
stopped
me
saying
excuse
me
you
do
not
know
me
but
i
know
you
i
turned
looked
at
him
carefully
and
said
i
do
not
know
you
oh
no
but
the
last
time
you
saw
me
you
cut
off
my
beard
with
your
scissors
and
fed
me
with
a
teaspoon
when
you
left
me
you
did
not
think
you
would
ever
see
me
again
oh
i
exclaimed
joyfully
you
are
dutton
he
laughed
and
replied
that
me
i
have
just
got
a
furlough
and
am
going
home
he
was
very
pale
and
thin
but
i
was
so
glad
to
see
him
and
shake
hands
and
wish
him
safely
home
with
his
friends
during
the
great
review
after
the
war
i
had
a
seat
near
the
stand
there
was
a
jam
and
a
man
behind
me
called
my
attention
to
a
captain
at
a
short
distance
who
had
something
to
say
to
me
and
passed
along
the
words
you
took
care
of
me
on
the
boat
coming
from
fredericksburg
looking
across
i
could
see
him
quite
well
but
even
when
his
hat
was
off
could
not
recognize
him
and
this
is
all
i
have
ever
heard
from
or
of
the
men
with
whose
lives
mine
was
so
knit
during
that
terrible
time
i
fear
that
not
many
survived
and
doubt
if
a
dozen
of
them
ever
knew
me
by
any
other
name
than
that
of
mother
chapter
lxxx
am
enlightened
when
early
appeared
before
washington
we
all
knew
there
was
nothing
to
prevent
his
coming
in
and
taking
possession
the
forts
were
stripped
there
were
no
soldiers
either
in
or
around
the
city
the
original
inhabitants
were
ready
to
welcome
him
with
open
arms
the
departments
were
closed
that
the
clerks
might
go
out
in
military
array
to
oppose
but
of
course
few
soldiers
were
sitting
at
desks
at
that
stage
of
the
war
the
news
at
the
quartermaster
office
one
morning
was
that
the
foreign
ministers
had
been
notified
and
that
the
city
would
be
shelled
that
afternoon
we
lived
on
the
north
side
of
the
city
and
when
i
went
home
thousands
of
people
were
on
the
streets
listening
to
the
sound
of
guns
at
fort
reno
so
far
as
i
knew
there
was
a
universal
expectation
that
the
city
would
be
occupied
by
rebel
troops
that
night
as
this
was
in
harmony
with
the
general
tenor
of
my
anticipations
for
a
quarter
of
a
century
i
readily
shared
in
the
popular
opinion
and
for
once
was
with
the
majority
among
the
groups
who
stood
in
the
streets
were
many
contrabands
and
their
faces
were
pitiful
to
see
one
woman
holding
a
ragged
infant
and
with
two
frightened
ragged
children
clinging
to
her
skirts
stood
literally
quaking
her
black
face
had
turned
gray
with
terror
and
she
came
to
me
and
asked
oh
missus
does
ye
tink
dey
will
get
in
suddenly
my
eyes
were
opened
like
those
of
the
prophet
servant
when
he
saw
the
horses
and
chariots
of
fire
and
i
replied
no
never
they
will
come
no
nearer
than
they
now
are
you
can
go
home
and
rest
in
peace
for
you
are
just
as
safe
from
them
as
if
you
were
in
heaven
she
was
greatly
comforted
but
a
gentleman
said
as
she
moved
away
i
wish
i
could
share
your
opinion
but
what
is
to
hinder
their
coming
in
god
is
to
hinder
he
has
appointed
us
to
rescue
these
people
they
are
collected
here
in
thousands
and
the
prayers
of
centuries
are
to
be
answered
now
i
myself
went
home
feeling
all
the
confidence
i
spoke
and
wondering
i
could
have
been
so
stupid
as
to
doubt
our
government
and
people
were
very
imperfect
but
had
developed
a
sublime
patriotism
made
an
almost
miraculous
growth
in
good
ten
righteous
men
would
have
saved
sodom
we
had
ten
thousand
and
i
must
think
there
are
few
histories
of
supernatural
interference
in
the
affairs
of
the
jews
more
difficult
to
account
for
on
merely
natural
grounds
than
the
preservation
of
washington
in
that
crisis
conclusion
december
the
fiftieth
anniversary
of
my
birth
found
me
in
washington
at
work
in
the
office
on
a
salary
of
sixty
dollars
a
month
without
any
provision
for
support
in
old
age
and
so
great
a
sufferer
as
never
to
have
a
night
of
rest
unbroken
by
severe
pain
but
with
my
interest
in
a
country
rescued
from
the
odium
of
southern
slavery
and
a
faint
light
breaking
of
the
day
which
is
yet
to
abolish
that
of
the
west
in
the
summer
of
king
of
pittsburg
came
to
know
what
i
would
take
for
my
interest
in
ten
acres
of
the
swissvale
estate
which
he
had
purchased
my
deed
had
presented
a
barrier
to
the
sale
of
a
portion
of
it
and
he
was
in
trouble
i
consulted
secretary
stanton
who
said
your
title
to
that
property
is
good
against
the
world
it
had
become
valuable
and
the
idea
of
its
ownership
was
alarming
i
had
made
up
my
mind
to
poverty
had
been
discharged
from
the
office
by
special
order
of
president
johnson
for
speaking
disrespectfully
of
the
president
of
the
united
states
was
the
first
person
dismissed
by
johnson
was
without
visible
means
of
support
could
not
suddenly
adjust
my
thought
to
anything
so
foreign
to
all
my
plans
as
coming
into
possession
of
a
valuable
estate
and
said
oh
secretary
stanton
how
shall
i
ever
undertake
such
a
stewardship
at
my
time
of
life
he
looked
sternly
at
me
and
replied
swisshelm
do
be
a
fool
take
care
of
yourself
it
is
time
you
would
begin
the
property
is
yours
now
you
are
morally
responsible
for
it
and
can
surely
make
some
better
use
of
it
than
giving
it
away
to
rich
men
around
pittsburg
go
at
once
and
attend
to
your
interests
this
was
our
last
interview
i
instituted
the
suit
he
advised
and
he
would
have
plead
my
cause
before
the
supreme
court
but
when
it
came
up
he
was
holding
possession
of
the
war
department
to
defeat
president
johnson
policy
of
making
the
south
triumphant
however
the
decree
of
the
court
was
in
my
favor
and
through
it
i
have
been
able
to
rescue
the
old
log
block
house
from
the
tooth
of
decay
and
to
sit
in
it
and
recall
those
passages
of
life
with
which
it
is
so
intimately
connected
the
end
