the
british
sanitary
congress
address
of
president
galton
the
congress
of
the
sanitary
institute
of
great
britain
was
opened
in
newcastle
on
september
the
inaugural
public
meeting
was
held
in
the
town
hall
de
chaumont
presided
in
the
place
of
the
lord
fortescue
and
introduced
captain
galton
the
new
president
the
president
commenced
his
inaugural
address
by
thanking
in
the
name
of
the
sanitary
institute
of
great
britain
the
mayor
and
corporation
of
newcastle
for
the
invitation
to
visit
this
important
industrial
metropolis
of
northern
england
the
invitation
he
said
was
the
more
satisfactory
because
newcastle
was
advancing
in
the
van
of
sanitary
improvement
and
was
thus
proving
the
interest
of
this
great
city
in
a
subject
which
was
contributing
largely
to
the
moral
and
material
progress
of
the
nation
of
all
the
definite
questions
which
were
made
the
subject
of
the
instruction
by
congresses
at
the
present
time
there
was
scarcely
one
which
deserved
a
greater
share
of
attention
than
that
which
called
that
congress
together
namely
the
subject
of
the
public
health
within
the
last
half
century
the
whole
community
had
been
gradually
awakening
to
the
importance
of
a
knowledge
of
the
laws
of
health
and
the
energies
of
some
of
the
ablest
intellects
in
the
world
had
been
employed
in
investigating
the
causes
of
disease
and
in
endeavoring
to
solve
the
problem
of
the
prevention
of
disease
there
was
much
that
was
still
obscure
in
this
very
intricate
problem
but
the
new
light
which
was
daily
being
thrown
upon
the
causes
of
disease
by
the
careful
and
exact
researches
of
the
chemist
and
physiologist
was
gradually
tending
to
explain
those
causes
and
to
raise
the
science
of
hygiene
or
science
of
prevention
of
disease
out
of
the
region
of
speculation
and
enable
it
to
take
rank
as
one
of
the
exact
sciences
long
ago
the
careful
observation
of
facts
had
shown
that
the
preservation
of
health
required
certain
conditions
to
be
observed
in
and
around
dwellings
conditions
which
when
neglected
had
led
to
the
outbreaks
of
epidemic
disease
from
the
days
of
moses
to
the
present
time
but
while
the
results
had
been
patent
it
was
only
in
recent
years
that
a
clew
had
been
obtained
to
the
occult
conditions
in
air
and
water
to
enable
their
comparative
healthful
purity
to
be
distinguished
the
researches
of
pasteur
in
respect
to
the
forms
of
disease
in
french
vineyards
opened
a
fruitful
field
of
inquiry
and
the
theories
of
bastian
on
spontaneous
generation
gave
rise
to
the
beautiful
series
of
experiments
by
tyndall
on
bacterian
life
a
large
band
of
leading
scientific
men
both
in
this
country
and
over
the
whole
world
were
devoting
their
energies
to
a
knowledge
of
the
recent
theories
on
the
propagation
of
disease
by
germs
in
a
lecture
on
fermentation
tyndall
remarked
that
the
researches
by
means
of
which
science
has
recently
elucidated
the
causes
of
fermentation
have
raised
the
art
of
brewing
from
being
an
art
founded
on
empirical
observation
that
is
to
say
on
the
observation
of
facts
apart
from
the
principles
which
explain
them
into
what
may
be
termed
an
exact
science
in
like
manner
if
recent
theories
on
the
propagation
of
disease
by
germs
were
proved
to
be
correct
and
if
the
laws
which
govern
the
propagation
or
destruction
of
those
germs
were
known
the
art
of
the
physician
would
be
similarly
raised
upon
these
questions
leading
scientific
men
all
over
the
world
were
devoting
their
energies
research
had
shown
that
putrefaction
was
only
another
form
of
organized
life
and
tyndall
had
shown
that
in
the
moving
particles
of
fine
dust
discovered
by
a
ray
of
light
in
a
dark
room
the
germs
of
low
forms
of
life
which
would
cause
putrefaction
were
ever
present
and
ready
to
spring
into
life
when
a
favorable
nidus
for
the
development
of
the
organism
was
provided
professor
lister
had
turned
this
knowledge
to
useful
account
in
surgery
in
causing
the
air
to
be
filtered
by
means
of
a
carbolic
spray
during
surgical
operations
by
which
means
germs
or
organisms
in
the
air
were
prevented
from
reaching
the
wounds
and
from
developing
organisms
the
presence
of
which
caused
putrefaction
or
suppuration
this
antiseptic
treatment
which
had
arisen
from
the
observation
of
germs
in
the
air
had
had
a
material
influence
on
the
art
of
surgery
throughout
the
world
the
speaker
then
reviewed
the
declarations
of
physiologists
regarding
the
theories
that
some
diseases
arise
from
minute
organisms
in
the
blood
pasteur
holding
that
the
disease
in
silkworms
was
from
this
cause
davaine
that
splenic
fever
in
cattle
arose
thus
klein
alleging
that
pig
typhoid
was
due
to
an
organism
toussaint
attributing
fowl
cholera
to
a
similar
cause
professor
koch
attributing
tubercular
disease
to
specific
germs
vandyke
carter
contending
that
there
was
a
connection
between
the
presence
of
bacillus
spirillum
and
relapsing
fever
and
talamon
claiming
to
have
discovered
that
diphtheria
was
due
to
an
organism
by
means
of
which
the
virus
could
be
conveyed
from
human
beings
to
animals
and
taking
another
branch
of
the
same
subject
the
causes
of
zymotic
diseases
being
traced
to
controllable
sources
he
said
drs
klebs
and
crudelli
allege
that
malarial
fever
arises
from
germs
present
in
the
soil
and
which
float
over
the
air
of
marshes
and
that
by
treating
with
water
the
soil
of
a
marsh
of
the
campagna
the
germs
of
this
organism
could
be
washed
out
and
that
the
water
containing
the
organisms
thus
obtained
introduced
into
the
circulation
of
a
dog
produced
ague
more
or
less
rapidly
and
more
or
less
violent
according
to
the
numbers
in
which
the
organisms
were
present
in
the
water
this
theory
no
doubt
agrees
with
certain
facts
in
a
tropical
climate
if
soil
which
has
been
long
undisturbed
or
the
soil
of
marshy
ground
be
turned
up
intermittent
fever
is
almost
certain
to
ensue
in
illustration
of
this
i
recollect
that
at
hong
kong
the
troops
were
unhealthy
and
a
beautiful
position
on
a
peninsula
exposed
to
the
most
favorable
was
selected
for
a
new
encampment
the
troops
were
encamped
upon
this
spot
for
some
time
to
test
its
healthiness
which
was
found
to
be
all
that
could
be
desired
it
was
then
resolved
to
build
barracks
as
soon
as
the
foundations
were
dug
fever
broke
out
as
an
instance
of
this
nearer
home
i
may
mention
that
last
winter
at
cannes
in
the
south
of
france
some
extensive
works
adjacent
to
the
town
were
begun
which
required
a
large
quantity
of
earth
to
be
moved
the
weather
was
exceptionally
warm
an
outbreak
of
fever
occurred
among
the
workmen
of
whom
fifteen
died
this
fever
was
attributed
to
the
turning
up
of
the
soil
if
a
strong
solution
of
quinine
be
let
fall
in
the
water
containing
these
organisms
they
at
once
die
the
efficacy
of
quinine
as
a
preventive
of
this
form
of
fever
would
therefore
not
be
inconsistent
with
this
theory
upon
this
subject
the
president
called
attention
to
the
view
of
sir
joseph
fayrer
who
acknowledged
the
importance
of
the
discovery
if
it
should
be
confirmed
but
considered
that
there
was
a
possibility
that
the
results
attributed
to
these
influences
might
to
some
extent
be
due
to
disturbance
of
the
system
in
a
body
predisposed
to
be
deranged
by
peculiarity
of
constitution
climatic
or
other
influence
of
the
nature
of
which
we
are
ignorant
though
it
is
conceivable
by
analogy
the
marvelous
facility
of
reproduction
of
various
germs
as
shown
by
pasteur
in
the
case
of
chicken
cholera
was
dwelt
upon
and
the
president
said
that
it
would
be
a
wonder
how
any
higher
form
of
life
could
exist
subject
to
the
possibility
of
invasion
by
such
countless
hosts
of
occult
enemies
were
it
not
seen
that
the
science
of
the
prevention
of
disease
advanced
quite
as
rapidly
as
our
knowledge
of
the
causes
holding
that
the
attitude
of
the
sanitarian
in
regard
to
the
germ
theory
of
diseases
as
applied
to
all
diseases
of
the
zymotic
class
must
be
one
of
reserve
yet
he
said
even
if
the
views
of
those
who
are
prepared
to
accept
the
germ
theory
of
disease
to
its
fullest
extent
were
shown
to
be
true
it
seems
to
be
certain
that
if
the
invasion
of
these
occult
enemies
present
in
the
air
is
undertaken
in
insufficient
force
or
upon
an
animal
in
sufficiently
robust
health
they
are
refused
a
foothold
and
expelled
or
if
they
have
secured
a
lodgment
in
the
tissues
they
so
to
speak
may
be
laid
hold
of
and
absorbed
or
digested
by
them
in
corroboration
of
this
view
professor
koch
and
others
state
that
the
minor
organisms
of
tubercular
disease
do
not
occur
in
the
tissues
of
healthy
bodies
and
that
when
introduced
into
the
living
body
their
propagation
and
increase
is
greatly
favored
by
a
low
state
of
the
general
health
the
president
held
that
for
the
present
sanitary
procedure
was
independent
of
these
theories
on
the
germ
origin
in
particular
of
zymotic
disease
but
gave
the
facts
as
worthy
of
consideration
as
indicating
points
for
the
direction
of
those
who
aimed
at
preventing
disease
the
president
dealt
with
the
important
subject
of
isolation
in
the
cases
of
contagious
zymotic
diseases
and
then
proceeding
to
discuss
the
subject
of
epidemic
diseases
said
notwithstanding
the
numerous
experiments
and
the
great
efforts
which
have
been
made
in
recent
times
to
endeavor
to
trace
out
the
origin
of
disease
the
sanitarian
has
not
yet
been
able
to
lift
up
the
veil
which
conceals
the
causes
connected
with
the
occurrence
of
epidemic
diseases
these
diseases
come
in
recurring
periods
sometimes
at
longer
sometimes
at
shorter
intervals
animals
as
well
as
the
human
race
are
similarly
affected
by
these
diseases
of
periodical
recurrence
but
why
they
prevail
more
in
one
year
than
in
another
we
are
entirely
ignorant
they
appear
to
be
subject
to
certain
aerial
or
climatic
conditions
cholera
affords
an
illustration
of
this
there
is
a
part
of
india
near
the
mouth
of
the
ganges
where
cholera
may
be
said
to
be
endemic
in
certain
years
but
why
we
know
not
it
spreads
out
of
this
district
and
moves
westward
over
the
country
the
people
are
sedentary
and
seldom
leave
home
but
the
cholera
travels
on
at
last
it
arrives
on
the
borders
of
the
desert
where
there
are
no
people
and
no
intercourse
no
alvine
secretions
and
no
sewers
yet
the
statistician
sitting
in
calcutta
can
tell
almost
the
day
on
which
the
epidemic
influence
will
have
crossed
the
desert
but
it
exercises
discrimination
in
its
attacks
it
will
visit
one
town
or
village
and
leave
many
others
in
the
vicinity
untouched
similarly
it
will
attack
one
house
and
leave
another
but
it
has
been
generally
found
that
the
attacked
house
or
village
held
out
special
invitation
from
its
insanitary
condition
the
same
houses
or
the
same
localities
will
be
revisited
in
recurring
epidemics
because
the
conditions
remain
the
same
remove
those
conditions
and
at
the
next
recurrence
the
locality
will
escape
at
malta
it
was
found
that
the
same
localities
and
houses
which
yielded
the
majority
of
plague
deaths
there
in
yielded
the
majority
of
the
deaths
in
the
cholera
epidemics
of
and
and
that
in
the
intervals
the
same
localities
yielded
the
majority
of
cases
of
fever
and
of
an
anthrax
a
very
special
eruptive
epidemic
attended
by
carbuncles
hence
while
we
are
unable
either
to
account
for
the
cause
or
to
prevent
the
periodic
recurrence
of
epidemics
the
sanitarian
has
learnt
that
it
is
possible
to
mitigate
the
severity
of
the
visit
and
that
whether
these
evils
arise
from
the
occult
causes
to
which
i
have
alluded
or
from
other
causes
pure
air
and
pure
water
afford
almost
absolute
safeguards
against
most
forms
of
zymotic
diseases
in
speaking
of
the
question
he
remarked
although
there
are
many
theories
as
to
how
far
water
which
has
once
been
contaminated
by
sewage
may
again
after
a
time
become
fit
to
drink
i
am
disposed
to
think
that
there
has
never
been
a
case
of
an
outbreak
of
disease
resulting
from
the
use
of
drinking
water
where
the
chemist
would
not
unhesitatingly
on
analysis
have
condemned
the
water
as
an
impure
source
and
it
appears
probable
that
whatever
may
be
the
actual
causes
of
certain
diseases
whether
germs
or
chemical
poisons
the
which
finds
its
way
into
the
river
at
the
sewage
outfall
is
destroyed
together
with
the
organic
impurity
after
a
certain
length
of
flow
he
pressed
that
there
should
be
no
further
delay
in
bringing
the
act
for
the
prevention
of
pollution
of
rivers
into
operation
and
in
enforcing
the
provisions
of
the
acts
in
regard
to
the
pollution
of
the
air
he
called
attention
to
the
fact
that
nearly
fifty
years
ago
edwin
chadwick
impressed
upon
the
community
the
evils
which
were
caused
by
the
impure
condition
of
the
air
in
our
towns
owing
to
the
retention
of
refuse
around
houses
the
speaker
remarked
that
the
gases
which
were
the
result
of
putrefaction
were
offensive
to
the
smell
and
some
of
them
such
as
sulphureted
hydrogen
when
present
in
undue
proportions
in
the
air
would
kill
persons
outright
or
when
those
gases
were
in
smaller
proportions
in
the
air
breathed
by
people
there
would
be
a
lowered
tone
of
health
in
the
individuals
exposed
to
them
continued
exposure
might
lead
to
the
development
of
other
conditions
which
in
their
turn
might
lead
to
disease
or
death
from
this
point
the
president
proceeded
to
speak
of
the
increased
toxical
power
of
volatile
compounds
given
off
by
neglected
decomposed
matter
and
was
thence
led
to
dwell
upon
the
dangers
arising
from
decomposed
substances
in
cesspools
and
in
badly
constructed
drains
there
was
no
doubt
he
said
that
in
the
sewering
of
towns
want
of
experience
in
the
construction
of
works
had
in
some
cases
led
to
deposits
in
the
sewers
and
evil
consequences
had
ensued
but
it
might
be
accepted
as
certain
that
in
every
case
where
the
sewerage
had
been
devised
on
sound
principles
and
where
the
works
had
been
carried
on
under
intelligent
supervision
a
largely
reduced
had
invariably
followed
evidence
of
this
fact
he
adduced
from
the
history
of
newcastle
for
in
the
ten
years
beginning
in
the
was
while
in
the
ten
years
ending
during
which
there
had
been
improved
sewerage
in
operation
the
was
only
while
in
it
was
only
he
instanced
the
like
results
in
munich
where
the
entire
fever
mortality
sank
from
in
the
period
when
there
were
no
regulations
in
regard
to
cleanliness
to
when
the
sewerage
was
complete
at
at
dantzic
and
at
hamburg
where
similar
results
obtained
of
a
heavy
zymotic
mortality
previous
to
the
sewering
of
the
cities
and
a
lighter
mortality
on
the
completion
of
the
works
these
results
were
set
forth
in
figures
and
after
dealing
with
the
beneficial
results
of
purifying
the
air
of
towns
by
the
rapid
abstraction
of
refuse
matter
he
passed
on
to
review
other
fertile
causes
of
mischief
in
poisoning
the
air
of
towns
the
chief
of
these
being
horse
manure
the
dust
of
refuse
and
smoke
on
this
subject
he
quoted
angus
smith
who
in
his
contributions
to
the
beginnings
of
a
chemical
climatology
shows
that
the
air
in
the
middle
of
the
atlantic
ocean
on
the
and
on
uncontaminated
open
spaces
commands
the
greatest
amount
of
oxygen
that
at
the
tops
of
hills
the
air
contains
more
oxygen
than
at
the
bottom
and
that
places
where
putrefaction
may
be
supposed
to
exist
are
subject
to
a
diminution
of
oxygen
for
instance
a
diminution
of
oxygen
and
an
increase
of
carbonic
acid
is
decidedly
apparent
in
crowded
rooms
theaters
cowhouses
and
stables
it
is
well
known
that
oxygen
over
putrid
substances
is
absorbed
while
carbonic
acid
and
other
gases
take
its
place
and
hence
all
places
near
or
in
our
houses
which
contain
impurities
diminish
the
oxygen
of
the
air
the
average
quantity
of
oxygen
in
pure
air
amounts
to
parts
out
of
in
impure
places
such
for
instance
as
in
a
where
the
windows
have
been
shut
all
night
or
in
a
after
a
lecture
or
in
a
close
stable
the
oxygen
has
been
found
to
be
reduced
to
as
little
as
parts
in
that
is
to
say
a
man
breathing
pure
air
obtains
and
he
requires
grains
of
oxygen
per
hour
in
bad
air
he
would
if
breathing
at
the
same
rate
get
little
over
grains
of
oxygen
an
hour
that
is
a
loss
of
per
cent
and
this
diminished
quantity
of
oxygen
is
replaced
with
other
and
in
almost
all
cases
pernicious
matters
the
oxygen
is
the
active
substance
that
keeps
up
the
fire
cooks
the
food
and
purifies
the
blood
and
of
course
as
the
proportion
of
oxygen
in
the
air
breathed
diminishes
the
lungs
must
exert
themselves
more
to
obtain
the
necessary
quantity
of
oxygen
for
carrying
on
the
functions
of
life
if
the
air
is
loaded
with
impurities
the
lungs
get
clogged
and
their
power
of
absorbing
the
oxygen
that
is
present
in
the
air
is
diminished
an
individual
breathing
this
impure
air
must
therefore
do
less
work
or
if
he
does
the
same
amount
of
work
it
is
at
a
greater
expense
to
his
system
the
influence
of
smoky
town
air
on
health
is
to
some
extent
illustrated
by
the
fact
that
the
of
manufacturing
towns
selected
chiefly
for
their
smoky
character
averaged
per
in
while
the
rural
districts
in
the
counties
of
wilts
dorset
and
devon
excluding
large
towns
averaged
per
and
the
deaths
from
the
principal
zymotic
diseases
in
the
towns
were
more
than
double
those
in
the
rural
districts
the
president
quoted
the
experiments
of
aitkin
of
edinburgh
on
the
creation
of
fogs
that
the
vapor
of
water
injected
into
air
from
which
particles
had
been
strained
out
was
not
visible
whereas
as
soon
as
foreign
matter
such
as
dust
or
smoke
or
fumes
and
especially
fumes
of
sulphur
were
introduced
the
aqueous
vapor
condensed
on
the
particles
and
became
visible
as
fog
and
pointed
out
the
fact
that
the
barbarous
method
which
we
adopt
for
burning
coal
in
this
country
adds
to
the
dust
the
fumes
which
necessarily
result
from
combustion
as
well
as
a
quantity
of
soot
and
tarry
matter
a
soot
which
assists
in
forming
the
black
canopy
which
it
is
the
fashion
in
england
to
consider
the
proper
attribute
of
a
large
town
he
quoted
the
opinions
of
eminent
scientific
men
to
show
that
it
was
possible
under
proper
methods
of
burning
coal
to
lessen
the
intensity
of
fogs
and
so
to
lessen
materially
the
causes
of
terminating
in
fatal
disease
of
those
subject
to
them
in
dealing
with
the
wide
subject
of
the
general
effect
of
sanitary
conditions
upon
health
he
gave
some
remarkable
facts
showing
that
sanitary
work
had
reduced
the
of
the
european
army
in
india
from
per
to
per
that
the
deaths
from
tubercular
disease
in
the
army
at
home
used
to
be
per
the
sum
total
now
of
the
total
deaths
from
all
causes
in
a
time
of
peace
a
reduction
due
to
the
improved
hygienic
conditions
under
which
soldiers
now
live
that
the
in
a
certain
part
of
newcastle
now
removed
used
to
be
per
and
of
the
entire
borough
so
lately
as
seven
years
ago
while
now
it
was
that
in
parts
of
london
where
the
people
were
and
crowded
as
in
parts
of
limehouse
whitechapel
aldgate
and
giles
the
were
per
cent
above
the
in
more
open
parts
of
the
same
districts
and
that
when
proper
dwellings
were
erected
the
fell
from
in
the
to
not
more
than
per
he
then
spoke
of
the
advantage
arising
to
the
health
of
the
population
generally
by
the
new
dwellings
for
artisans
he
remarked
that
these
improved
dwellings
afford
accommodation
to
a
population
per
acre
as
dense
as
and
in
most
cases
even
denser
than
that
afforded
by
the
buildings
which
they
replaced
within
limits
it
is
not
the
density
of
population
which
regulates
the
health
but
if
a
dense
population
is
spread
over
the
surface
or
close
to
the
surface
of
the
ground
by
which
means
all
movement
of
air
is
prevented
and
if
there
are
numerous
corners
in
which
refuse
is
accumulated
it
will
be
difficult
to
prevent
disease
angus
smith
experiments
show
that
while
there
is
less
oxygen
and
more
carbonic
acid
in
the
eastern
and
in
the
more
crowded
parts
of
london
yet
in
open
spaces
the
amount
of
oxygen
rises
and
the
carbonic
acid
diminishes
very
considerably
and
that
we
are
exposed
to
distinct
currents
of
good
air
in
the
worst
and
equally
to
currents
of
bad
air
in
the
best
atmosphere
in
towns
like
manchester
tyndall
showed
that
where
there
is
quiescence
in
the
air
the
tendency
of
his
sterilized
infusions
to
produce
organisms
was
increased
the
conclusion
from
all
these
experiments
is
to
show
the
importance
of
laying
out
the
general
plan
of
dwellings
in
a
town
so
that
currents
of
air
shall
be
able
to
flow
on
all
sides
with
as
little
impediment
as
possible
by
which
means
the
air
will
be
continually
liable
to
renewal
by
purer
air
the
dwellings
which
have
been
constructed
in
the
place
of
the
very
defective
dwellings
condemned
by
the
medical
officers
of
health
in
various
parts
of
london
specially
illustrate
the
importance
of
this
question
of
the
circulation
of
air
these
dwellings
replace
those
in
which
the
normal
mortality
was
as
much
as
and
per
but
these
improved
dwellings
provide
ample
space
all
round
the
blocks
of
building
so
that
air
can
flow
round
and
through
them
in
every
direction
and
so
that
there
are
no
narrow
courts
and
hidden
corners
for
the
accumulation
of
refuse
the
mortality
in
the
new
dwellings
is
as
low
as
per
in
some
and
does
not
rise
above
per
in
any
of
them
and
upon
an
average
of
years
it
may
be
taken
at
from
to
per
it
is
to
this
point
that
i
specially
desire
to
draw
attention
namely
that
these
facts
prove
the
possibility
of
bringing
down
the
of
the
class
of
population
which
inhabits
this
sort
of
accommodation
to
rates
varying
from
to
per
i
say
of
the
class
of
population
because
habits
and
mode
of
life
have
an
important
influence
on
health
and
on
longevity
chadwick
and
richardson
obtained
some
statistics
for
westminster
for
the
use
of
a
committee
of
the
society
of
arts
which
indicate
the
very
different
conditions
of
health
to
which
the
different
classes
of
population
are
subject
it
appeared
from
these
statistics
that
out
of
one
hundred
deaths
of
the
first
class
or
gentry
six
were
those
of
children
in
their
first
year
and
nine
of
children
within
their
fifth
year
while
out
of
one
hundred
deaths
of
the
wage
classes
are
those
of
children
in
their
first
year
and
within
their
fifth
year
if
we
take
the
average
duration
of
life
of
all
who
have
died
of
the
first
class
men
women
and
children
we
find
that
they
have
had
an
average
of
years
and
eight
months
of
life
while
of
the
wage
classes
they
have
had
a
mean
of
only
years
and
nine
months
and
if
we
take
the
average
duration
of
life
of
those
who
have
escaped
the
earlier
ravages
of
death
up
to
twenty
years
of
age
the
males
who
have
died
of
the
first
class
have
had
years
of
life
while
of
the
wage
class
the
males
have
had
only
years
and
seven
months
moreover
of
the
first
class
in
westminster
the
proportion
who
have
attained
the
old
age
and
died
of
natural
causes
is
per
but
of
the
wage
classes
only
a
fraction
or
per
did
so
i
have
obtained
similar
returns
for
this
town
it
was
considered
desirable
for
the
purpose
of
this
return
to
divide
the
population
into
the
following
five
classes
first
gentry
and
professional
men
second
tradesmen
and
shopkeepers
third
shipwrights
chain
and
anchor
smiths
iron
forge
laborers
fourth
seamen
watermen
fishermen
etc
fifth
other
wage
clashes
and
artisans
and
each
of
these
classes
represents
distinct
sanitary
conditions
and
habits
of
life
the
healthiest
class
is
that
of
the
seamen
watermen
and
fishermen
the
mean
age
at
death
of
all
who
died
of
that
class
men
women
and
children
is
years
as
compared
with
thirty
five
years
for
gentry
and
professional
men
while
the
mean
age
of
shipwrights
chain
and
anchor
makers
and
iron
forge
laborers
is
only
years
the
president
considered
that
these
points
gave
much
food
for
reflection
he
then
touched
upon
the
important
question
of
the
effect
of
occupation
upon
health
and
remarked
if
we
take
the
professional
and
merchant
class
who
attend
at
their
offices
during
the
daytime
we
may
be
sure
that
as
a
rule
they
are
placed
in
unhealthy
surroundings
during
that
time
and
in
many
cases
have
to
breathe
during
their
hours
of
work
as
bad
an
atmosphere
as
that
in
which
the
wage
classes
work
he
also
quoted
returns
showing
that
the
great
mortality
among
the
tradesmen
class
in
westminster
was
explained
from
the
fact
that
the
best
rooms
in
the
houses
in
which
they
live
were
let
for
lodgings
the
tradesmen
contenting
themselves
with
living
in
the
basements
or
back
premises
which
were
frequently
unhealthy
he
looked
for
great
improvements
in
the
health
of
the
wage
classes
by
the
construction
of
improved
dwellings
but
he
confessed
in
many
cases
workmen
required
to
be
taught
to
attend
to
precautions
devised
for
their
health
on
the
subject
of
sickness
caused
by
insanitary
conditions
he
quoted
the
remark
of
an
east
london
clergyman
that
the
poor
go
on
living
in
wretched
places
but
have
much
he
showed
from
figures
that
the
london
voluntary
hospitals
and
dispensaries
cost
nearly
a
year
to
administer
an
expenditure
incurred
mainly
for
the
purpose
of
patching
up
the
wretched
poor
who
had
been
injured
by
bad
drainage
want
of
ventilation
and
the
like
and
he
urged
that
it
might
be
safely
assumed
preventive
measures
would
bring
down
the
of
the
wage
class
to
reducing
also
the
sickness
rate
in
at
least
a
similar
proportion
by
means
of
this
item
alone
the
power
of
the
industrious
classes
would
be
enlarged
by
some
millions
of
pounds
and
their
comfort
correspondingly
increased
there
would
also
he
contended
be
other
distinct
economies
for
there
would
be
less
need
for
much
of
the
accommodation
in
prisons
reformatories
and
workhouses
now
needed
from
evils
incident
to
unhealthy
circumstances
and
crowded
dwellings
he
dwelt
upon
the
economic
advantages
of
sanitary
measures
generally
dealing
first
with
the
subject
of
the
conversion
of
sewage
into
manure
and
then
in
relation
to
the
provision
of
healthful
dwellings
such
as
those
of
the
metropolitan
association
for
improving
the
dwellings
of
the
industrial
classes
he
showed
that
the
cost
of
such
dwellings
had
been
about
for
persons
by
the
saving
in
life
and
health
through
the
continuance
in
earning
power
of
men
whose
lives
would
otherwise
have
been
cut
short
he
estimated
that
the
expenditure
of
the
for
the
persons
by
the
addition
often
years
earning
power
to
the
heads
of
families
brought
in
a
return
of
and
urged
these
facts
as
showing
the
pecuniary
advantages
accruing
to
the
nation
from
sanitary
improvements
which
led
to
decreased
death
and
sickness
rates
on
the
one
hand
he
said
insanitary
dwellings
and
insanitary
conditions
of
life
engendered
sickness
entailed
poverty
and
fostered
crime
while
improved
dwellings
insured
improved
health
and
by
affording
a
security
for
the
more
continuous
earning
of
wages
created
the
possibility
of
a
comfortable
home
advanced
sanitarians
had
long
preached
these
doctrines
and
he
was
happy
to
think
that
they
were
at
last
beginning
to
hear
some
results
and
in
those
results
he
saw
the
means
of
developing
morality
contentment
and
happiness
among
the
people

psychological
development

body
of
facts
and
deductions
the
work
is
divided
into
three
parts
of
which
the
first
deals
with
the
development
of
the
senses
the
second
with
the
development
of
the
will
and
the
third
with
the
development
of
the
understanding
beginning
with
the
sense
of
sight
the
observations
show
that
light
is
perceived
within
five
minutes
after
birth
and
that
the
pupils
react
within
the
first
hour
on
the
second
day
the
eyes
are
closed
upon
the
approach
of
a
flame
on
the
eleventh
the
child
seemed
to
enjoy
the
sensation
of
light
and
on
the
to
appreciate
the
rose
color
of
a
curtain
by
smiling
at
it
definite
proof
of
color
discrimination
was
first
obtained
in
the
week
but
may
of
course
have
been
present
earlier
when
seven
hundred
and
seventy
days
old
the
child
could
point
to
the
colors
yellow
red
green
and
blue
upon
these
being
named
the
eyelids
are
first
closed
to
protect
the
eyes
from
the
sudden
approach
of
a
threatening
body
in
the
seventh
or
eighth
week
although
as
already
observed
they
will
close
against
a
strong
light
as
early
as
the
second
day
the
explanation
of
their
beginning
to
close
against
the
approach
of
a
threatening
body
is
supposed
to
be
that
an
uncomfortable
sensation
is
produced
by
the
sudden
and
unexpected
appearance
which
causes
the
lids
to
close
without
the
child
having
any
idea
of
danger
to
its
eyes
and
the
effect
is
not
produced
earlier
in
life
because
the
eyes
do
not
then
see
sufficiently
well
on
the
day
the
child
first
definitely
noticed
its
father
face
when
he
nodded
or
spoke
in
a
deep
voice
the
child
blinked
this
professor
preyer
calls
a
but
definite
astonishment
at
the
rapid
opening
and
closing
of
a
fan
was
not
observed
till
the
seventh
month
the
gaze
was
first
fixed
on
a
stationary
light
on
the
sixth
day
and
the
head
was
first
moved
after
a
moving
light
on
the
eleventh
day
on
the
day
the
eyeballs
were
first
moved
after
a
moving
object
without
rotation
of
the
head
and
on
the
day
objects
were
first
sought
by
the
eyes
up
to
this
date
the
motion
of
the
moving
object
must
be
slow
if
it
is
to
be
followed
by
the
eyes
but
on
the
one
hundred
and
first
day
a
pendulum
swinging
forty
times
a
minute
was
followed
in
the
week
the
child
looked
after
fallen
objects
and
in
the
purposely
threw
objects
down
and
looked
after
them
knowledge
of
weight
appeared
to
be
attained
in
the
week
persons
were
first
distinguished
as
friends
or
strangers
in
the
sixth
month
photographs
of
persons
were
first
recognized
in
the
one
hundred
and
eighth
week
and
all
glass
bottles
were
classified
as
belonging
to
the
same
genus
as
the
in
the
eighth
month
with
regard
to
the
sense
of
hearing
it
is
first
remarked
that
all
children
for
some
time
after
birth
are
completely
deaf
and
it
was
not
till
the
middle
of
the
fourth
day
that
professor
preyer
obtained
any
evidence
of
hearing
in
his
child
this
child
first
turned
his
head
in
the
direction
of
a
sound
in
the
eleventh
week
and
this
movement
in
the
sixteenth
week
had
become
as
rapid
and
certain
as
a
reflex
at
eight
months
or
a
year
before
its
first
attempts
at
speaking
the
infant
distinguished
between
a
tone
and
a
noise
as
shown
by
its
pleasure
on
hearing
the
sounds
of
a
piano
after
the
first
year
the
child
found
satisfaction
in
itself
striking
the
piano
in
the
month
it
danced
to
music
and
in
the
twenty
fourth
imitated
song
but
it
is
stated
on
the
authority
of
other
observers
that
some
children
have
been
able
to
sing
pitch
correctly
and
even
a
melody
as
early
as
nine
months
one
such
child
used
at
this
age
to
sing
in
its
sleep
and
at
nineteen
months
could
beat
time
correctly
with
its
hand
while
singing
an
air
concerning
touch
taste
and
smell
there
is
not
so
much
to
quote
though
it
appears
that
at
birth
the
sense
of
taste
is
best
developed
and
that
the
infant
then
recognizes
the
difference
between
sweet
salt
sour
and
bitter
likewise
passing
over
a
number
of
observations
on
the
feelings
of
hunger
thirst
satisfaction
we
come
to
the
emotions
fear
was
first
shown
in
the
fourteenth
week
the
child
had
an
instinctive
dread
of
thunder
and
later
on
of
cats
and
dogs
of
falling
from
a
height
etc
the
date
at
which
affection
and
sympathy
first
showed
themselves
does
not
appear
to
have
been
noted
though
at
months
the
child
cried
on
seeing
some
paper
figures
of
men
being
cut
with
a
pair
of
scissors
in
the
second
part
of
the
book
it
is
remarked
that
voluntary
movements
are
preceded
not
only
by
reflex
but
also
by
impulsive
movements
the
ceaseless
activity
of
young
infants
being
due
to
purposeless
discharges
of
nervous
energy
reflex
movements
are
followed
by
instinctive
and
these
by
voluntary
the
latter
are
first
shown
by
grasping
at
objects
which
took
place
in
preyer
child
during
the
nineteenth
week
the
opposition
of
the
thumb
to
the
fingers
which
in
the
ape
is
acquired
during
the
first
week
is
very
slowly
acquired
in
the
child
while
of
course
the
opposition
of
the
great
toe
is
never
acquired
at
all
in
preyer
child
the
thumb
was
first
opposed
to
the
fingers
on
the
day
up
to
the
seventeenth
month
there
is
great
uncertainty
in
finding
the
mouth
with
anything
held
in
the
hand
a
spoon
for
instance
striking
the
cheeks
chin
or
nose
instead
of
at
once
going
between
the
lips
this
forms
a
striking
contrast
to
the
case
of
young
chickens
which
are
able
to
peck
grains
soon
after
they
are
hatched
sucking
is
not
a
pure
reflex
because
a
satisfied
child
will
not
suck
when
its
lips
are
properly
stimulated
and
further
the
action
may
be
originated
centrally
as
in
a
sleeping
suckling
at
a
later
stage
biting
is
as
instinctive
as
sucking
and
was
first
observed
to
occur
in
the
seventeenth
week
with
the
toothless
gums
later
than
biting
but
still
before
the
teeth
are
cut
chewing
becomes
instinctive
and
also
licking
between
the
tenth
and
the
sixteenth
week
the
head
becomes
completely
balanced
the
efforts
in
this
direction
being
voluntary
and
determined
by
the
greater
comfort
of
holding
the
head
in
an
upright
position
sitting
up
usually
begins
about
the
fourth
month
but
may
begin
much
later
in
this
connection
an
interesting
remark
of
lauder
brunton
is
alluded
to
bible
and
science
page
namely
that
when
a
young
child
sits
upon
the
floor
the
soles
of
his
feet
are
turned
inward
facing
one
another
as
is
the
case
with
monkeys
when
laid
upon
their
faces
children
at
earliest
can
right
themselves
during
the
fifth
month
preyer
child
first
attempted
to
stand
in
the
week
but
it
was
not
until
the
beginning
of
the
second
year
that
it
could
stand
alone
or
without
assistance
the
walking
movements
which
are
performed
by
a
child
much
too
young
to
walk
when
it
is
held
so
that
its
feet
touch
the
ground
are
classified
by
preyer
as
instinctive
the
time
at
which
walking
proper
begins
varies
much
with
different
children
the
limits
being
from
eight
to
sixteen
months
when
a
child
which
is
beginning
to
walk
falls
it
throws
its
arms
forward
to
break
the
fall
this
action
must
be
instinctive
in
the
month
preyer
child
began
spontaneously
to
dance
to
music
and
to
beat
time
correctly
a
chapter
is
devoted
to
imitative
movements
at
the
end
of
the
fifteenth
week
the
child
would
imitate
the
movement
of
protruding
the
lips
at
nine
months
would
cry
on
hearing
other
children
do
so
and
at
twelve
months
used
to
perform
in
its
sleep
imitative
movements
which
had
made
a
strong
impression
while
awake
blowing
this
shows
that
dreaming
occurs
at
least
as
early
as
the
first
year
after
the
first
year
imitative
movements
are
more
readily
learned
than
before
shaking
the
head
as
a
sign
of
negation
was
found
by
preyer
as
by
other
observers
to
be
instinctive
and
he
adopts
darwin
explanation
of
the
fact
that
the
satisfied
suckling
in
refusing
the
breast
must
needs
move
its
head
from
side
to
side
in
the
seventeenth
month
the
child
exhibited
a
definite
act
of
intelligent
adjustment
for
desiring
to
reach
a
toy
down
from
a
press
it
drew
a
from
another
part
of
the
room
to
stand
upon
we
mention
this
incident
because
it
exhibits
the
same
level
of
mental
development
as
that
of
cuvier
orang
which
on
desiring
to
reach
an
object
off
a
high
shelf
drew
a
chair
below
the
shelf
to
stand
upon
anger
was
expressed
in
the
tenth
month
shame
and
pride
in
the
nineteenth
between
the
tenth
and
eleventh
month
the
first
perception
of
causality
was
observed
thus
on
the
three
hundred
and
nineteenth
day
the
child
was
beating
on
a
plate
with
a
spoon
and
accidentally
found
that
the
sound
was
damped
by
placing
the
other
hand
upon
the
plate
it
then
changed
its
hands
and
repeated
the
experiment
similarly
at
eleven
months
it
struck
a
spoon
upon
a
newspaper
and
changed
hands
to
see
if
this
would
modify
the
sound
in
some
children
however
the
perception
of
causality
to
this
extent
occurs
earlier
the
present
writer
has
seen
a
boy
when
exactly
eight
months
old
deriving
much
pleasure
from
striking
the
keys
of
a
piano
and
clearly
showing
that
he
understood
the
action
of
striking
the
keys
to
be
the
antecedent
required
for
the
production
of
the
sound
the
third
part
of
the
book
is
concerned
as
already
stated
with
the
development
of
the
understanding
here
it
is
noticed
that
memory
and
recognition
of
the
mother
voice
occurs
as
early
as
the
second
month
at
four
months
the
child
cried
for
his
absent
nurse
and
at
eighteen
months
he
knew
if
one
of
ten
toy
animals
were
removed
in
opinion
and
we
think
there
can
be
no
question
of
its
accuracy
the
intelligence
of
a
child
before
it
can
speak
a
word
is
in
advance
of
that
of
the
most
intelligent
animal
he
gives
numerous
examples
to
prove
that
a
high
level
of
reason
is
attained
by
infants
shortly
before
they
begin
to
speak
and
therefore
that
the
doctrine
which
ascribes
all
thought
to
language
is
erroneous
highly
elaborate
observations
were
made
on
the
development
of
speech
the
date
at
which
every
new
articulate
sound
was
made
being
recorded
the
following
appear
to
us
the
results
under
this
head
which
are
most
worth
quoting
instinctive
articulation
without
meaning
may
occur
as
early
as
the
seventh
week
but
usually
not
till
the
end
of
the
first
half
year
tones
are
understood
before
words
and
vowel
sounds
before
consonants
so
that
if
the
vowel
sounds
alone
are
given
of
a
word
which
the
child
understands
thirteen
months
it
will
understand
as
well
as
if
the
word
were
fully
spoken
many
children
before
they
are
six
months
old
will
repeat
words
by
mere
imitation
without
attaching
to
them
any
meaning
but
this
never
takes
place
before
the
first
understanding
of
certain
other
words
is
shown
never
earlier
than
the
fourth
month
again
all
children
which
hear
but
do
not
yet
speak
thus
repeat
many
words
without
understanding
them
and
conversely
understand
many
words
without
being
able
to
repeat
them
such
facts
lead
professor
preyer
to
suggest
a
somewhat
elaborate
of
the
mechanism
of
speech
both
on
its
physiological
and
psychological
aspects
but
this
we
have
not
sufficient
space
to
reproduce
although
the
formation
of
ideas
is
not
at
first
or
even
for
a
considerable
time
dependent
on
speech
any
more
than
it
is
in
the
case
of
the
lower
animals
it
constitutes
the
condition
to
the
learning
of
speech
and
afterward
speech
reacts
upon
the
development
of
ideation
a
child
may
and
usually
does
imitate
the
sounds
of
animals
as
names
of
the
animals
which
make
them
long
before
it
can
speak
one
word
and
so
far
as
preyer
evidence
goes
interjections
are
all
originally
imitative
of
sounds
children
with
a
still
very
small
vocabulary
use
words
metaphorically
as
to
signify
the
upper
gums
and
it
is
a
mistake
to
suppose
that
the
first
words
in
a
child
vocabulary
are
invariably
as
distinguished
from
adjectives
or
even
verbs
as
this
statement
is
at
variance
with
almost
universal
opinion
we
think
it
is
desirable
to
furnish
the
following
corroboration
the
present
writer
has
notes
of
a
child
which
possessed
a
vocabulary
of
only
a
dozen
words
or
so
the
only
properly
english
words
were
poor
dirty
and
cook
and
of
these
the
two
adjectives
no
less
than
the
were
always
appropriately
used
the
remaining
words
were
nursery
words
and
of
these
was
used
as
a
verb
meaning
to
go
to
go
out
to
go
away
inclusive
of
all
possible
moods
and
tenses
thus
for
instance
on
one
occasion
when
the
child
was
wheeling
about
her
doll
in
her
own
perambulator
the
writer
stole
away
the
doll
without
her
perceiving
the
theft
when
she
thought
that
the
doll
had
had
a
sufficiently
long
ride
she
walked
round
the
perambulator
to
take
it
out
not
finding
the
doll
where
she
had
left
it
she
was
greatly
perplexed
and
then
began
to
say
many
times
poor
poor
this
clearly
meant
poor
has
disappeared
and
many
other
examples
might
be
given
of
this
child
similarly
using
her
small
stock
of
adjectives
and
verbs
correctly
according
to
preyer
from
the
first
week
to
the
fifth
month
the
only
vowel
sounds
used
are
and
on
the
day
he
heard
the
first
consonant
which
was
and
also
the
vowel
next
day
the
child
said
on
the
day
and
on
the
all
the
vowel
sounds
were
acquired
in
the
fifth
month
we
have
no
space
to
go
further
into
the
successive
dates
at
which
the
remaining
consonants
were
acquired
in
the
eleventh
month
the
child
first
to
articulate
a
certain
word
by
imitation
and
afterward
repeated
the
taught
word
spontaneously
the
first
year
passed
without
any
other
indication
of
a
connection
between
articulation
and
ideation
than
was
supplied
by
the
child
using
a
string
of
different
syllables
and
not
merely
a
repetition
of
the
same
one
on
perceiving
a
rapid
movement
as
any
one
hurriedly
leaving
the
room
etc
but
this
child
nevertheless
understood
certain
words
such
as
handchen
geben
when
only
weeks
old
inefficient
attempts
at
imitative
speaking
precede
the
accurate
attempts
and
at
fourteen
months
this
inefficiency
was
still
very
apparent
being
in
marked
contrast
with
the
precision
whereby
it
would
imitate
syllables
which
it
could
already
say
the
to
imitate
all
syllables
was
present
though
not
the
at
the
beginning
of
the
fourteenth
month
on
being
asked
wo
ist
dein
schrank
the
child
would
turn
its
head
in
the
direction
of
the
cupboard
draw
the
person
who
asked
the
question
toward
it
though
the
child
could
not
then
walk
and
so
with
other
objects
the
names
of
which
it
knew
during
the
next
month
the
child
would
point
to
the
object
when
the
question
was
asked
and
also
cough
blow
or
stamp
on
being
told
to
do
so
in
the
seventeenth
month
there
was
a
considerable
advance
in
the
use
of
such
as
bringing
a
hat
to
the
nurse
as
a
request
to
go
out
but
still
no
words
were
spoken
save
etc
in
the
twentieth
month
the
child
could
first
repeat
words
of
two
unlike
syllables
when
months
old
the
first
evidence
of
judgment
was
given
the
child
having
drunk
milk
which
was
too
hot
for
it
said
the
word
heiss
in
the
week
this
word
had
been
learnt
in
imitative
speaking
so
it
required
eight
and
a
half
months
for
it
to
be
properly
used
as
a
predicate
at
the
same
age
on
being
asked
where
is
your
beard
the
child
would
place
its
hand
on
its
chin
and
move
its
thumb
and
fingers
as
if
drawing
hair
through
them
or
as
it
was
in
the
habit
of
doing
if
it
touched
its
father
beard
this
is
evidence
of
imagination
which
however
certainly
occurs
much
earlier
in
life
at
the
close
of
the
second
year
a
great
advance
was
made
in
using
two
words
together
as
a
sentence
home
milk
to
signify
a
desire
to
go
home
and
have
some
milk
in
the
first
month
of
the
third
year
sentences
of
three
or
even
four
words
were
used
as
papa
pear
plate
please
hitherto
the
same
word
would
often
be
employed
to
express
several
or
many
associated
meanings
and
no
words
appeared
to
have
been
entirely
invented
the
powers
of
association
and
inference
were
well
developed
for
instance
the
child
received
many
presents
on
its
birthday
and
being
pleased
said
bursta
afterward
when
similarly
pleased
it
would
say
the
same
word
again
when
it
injured
its
hand
it
was
told
to
blow
upon
it
and
on
afterward
knocking
its
head
it
blew
into
the
air
at
this
age
also
the
power
of
making
propositions
advanced
considerably
as
was
shown
for
instance
by
the
following
sentence
on
seeing
milk
spilt
upon
the
floor
mime
atta
teppa
papa
oï
which
was
equivalent
to
milch
fort
auf
den
teppich
papa
sagte
pfui
but
it
is
interesting
that
at
this
age
words
were
learnt
with
an
erroneous
apprehension
of
their
meaning
this
was
particularly
the
case
with
pronouns
dein
bett
for
example
being
supposed
to
mean
das
grosse
bett
all
words
which
were
spontaneously
acquired
seemed
to
be
instances
of
onomatopoeia
adverbs
were
first
used
in
the
month
and
now
also
words
which
had
previously
been
used
to
express
a
variety
of
associated
or
generic
meanings
were
discarded
for
more
specific
ones
in
the
month
prepositions
were
first
used
and
questions
were
first
asked
in
the
month
the
chief
advance
was
in
naming
self
with
a
pronoun
as
in
give
me
bread
but
the
word
i
was
not
yet
spoken
when
asked
wer
ist
mir
the
child
would
say
its
own
name
although
the
child
had
long
been
able
to
say
its
numerals
it
was
only
in
this
month
that
it
attained
to
an
understanding
of
their
use
in
counting
in
the
month
the
word
i
was
acquired
but
still
the
child
seemed
to
prefer
speaking
of
itself
in
the
third
person
the
long
disquisition
on
the
acquirement
of
speech
is
supplemented
by
a
chapter
conveying
the
observations
of
other
writers
upon
the
same
subject
this
is
followed
by
an
interesting
chapter
on
the
development
of
and
the
work
concludes
with
a
summary
of
results
there
are
also
lengthy
appendices
on
the
acquirements
of
correct
vision
after
surgical
operations
by
those
who
have
been
born
blind
and
on
the
mental
condition
of
uneducated
deaf
mutes
but
we
have
no
space
left
to
go
into
these
subjects
enough
we
trust
has
been
said
to
show
that
professor
preyer
laborious
undertaking
is
the
most
important
contribution
which
has
yet
appeared
to
the
department
of
psychology
with
which
it
is
concerned

he
complained
that
the
study
of

from
a
scientific
point
of
view
especially
in
history
as
enacted
by
him
was
mostly
neglected
although
it
ought
to
be
nay
would
and
must
more
and
more
become
our
most
important
subject
as
forming
the
only
real
basis
of
all
our
higher
culture
history
was
undoubtedly
a
deductive
science
but
it
could
be
verified
and
put
to
the
best
uses
by
the
purely
inductive
study
of
facts
any
change
whether
progressive
or
retrospective
in
the
social
political
or
religious
condition
of
men
would
be
a
fact
the
acting
forces
were
men
of
whom
there
were
on
the
globe
more
than
a
thousand
millions
all
endowed
with
three
principal
faculties
of
receiving
impressions
which
produced
sensations
and
were
reflected
in
their
intellectual
consciousness
but
neither
in
comparing
individuals
with
one
another
nor
race
with
race
were
these
faculties
equally
developed
they
varied

as
a
general
statement
it
was
remarked
however
that
the
brain
was
very
small
relatively
to
the

while
the
cerebellum
formed
a
very
large
portion
of
the
organ
the
statical
and
dynamical
forces
of
the
intellect
were
said
to
be
undeveloped

predominating
the
long
extinct
american
toltecs

as
one
section
of
a
subdivision

figured
for
cubic

of
brain
in
both
directions
the
intellectual
forces
were
marked
as
undeveloped
but
the
toltecs
were
credited
with
great
imitative
powers
the
other
section
comprising
the
hottentots
and
australian
black
fellows
were
allowed
but
cubic
inches
of
brain
or
not
more
than
above
the
highest

and
in
neither
did
the
statical

with
an
average

more

respects
from
the
ordinary
standard
but
yet
whose
mental
processes
are
not
directly
at
variance
with
that
standard
are
said
to
be
eccentric
eccentricity
is
generally
inherent
in
the
individual
or
is
gradually
developed
in
him
from
the
operation
of
unrecognized
causes
as
he
advances
in
years
if
an
original
condition
it
may
be
shown
from
a
very
early
period
of
life
his
plays
even
being
different
from
those
of
other
children
of
his
age
doubtless
it
then
depends
upon
some
peculiarity
of
brain
structure
which
within
the
limits
of
the
normal
range
produces
individuality
of
mental
action
but
eccentricity
is
not
always
an
original
condition
for
under
certain
circumstances
it
may
be
acquired
a
person
for
instance
meets
with
some
circumstance
in
his
life
which
tends
to
weaken
his
confidence
in
human
nature
he
accordingly
shuns
mankind
by
shutting
himself
up
in
his
own
house
and
refusing
to
have
any
intercourse
with
the
inhabitants
of
the
place
in
which
he
resides
in
carrying
out
his
purpose
he
proceeds
to
the
most
absurd
extremes
he
speaks
to
no
one
he
meets
returns
no
salutations
and
his
relations
with
the
tradesmen
who
supply
his
daily
wants
are
conducted
through
gratings
in
the
door
of
his
dwelling
he
dies
and
the
will
which
he
leaves
behind
him
is
found
to
devote
his
entire
property
for
the
founding
of
a
hospital
for
sick
and
ownerless
dogs
the
most
faithful
creatures
i
have
ever
met
and
the
only
ones
in
which
i
have
any
confidence
such
a
man
is
not
insane
there
is
a
rational
motive
for
his
conduct
one
which
many
of
us
have
experienced
and
which
has
perhaps
prompted
us
to
act
in
a
similar
manner
if
not
to
the
same
extent
another
is
engaged
in
vast
mercantile
transactions
requiring
the
most
thorough
exercise
of
the
best
faculties
of
the
mind
he
studies
the
markets
of
the
world
and
buys
and
sells
with
uniform
shrewdness
and
success
in
all
the
relations
of
life
he
conducts
himself
with
the
utmost
propriety
and
consideration
for
the
rights
and
feelings
of
others
the
most
complete
study
of
his
character
and
acts
fails
to
show
the
existence
of
the
slightest
defect
in
his
mental
processes
he
goes
to
church
regularly
every
sunday
but
has
never
been
regarded
as
a
particularly
religious
man
nevertheless
he
has
one
peculiarity
he
is
a
collector
of
bibles
and
has
several
thousand
of
all
sizes
and
styles
and
in
many
languages
if
he
hears
of
a
bible
in
any
part
of
the
world
different
in
any
respect
from
those
he
owns
he
at
once
endeavors
to
obtain
it
no
matter
how
difficult
the
undertaking
or
how
much
it
may
cost
except
in
the
matter
of
bibles
he
is
disposed
to
be
some
what
penurious
although
his
estate
is
large
and
has
been
known
to
refuse
to
have
a
salad
for
his
dinner
on
account
of
the
high
price
of
good
he
makes
his
will
and
dies
and
then
it
is
found
that
his
whole
property
is
left
in
trust
to
be
employed
in
the
maintenance
of
his
library
of
bibles
in
purchasing
others
which
may
become
known
to
the
trustees
and
in
printing
one
copy
for
his
library
of
the
book
in
any
language
in
which
it
does
not
already
exist
a
letter
which
is
addressed
to
his
trustees
informs
them
that
when
he
was
a
boy
a
bible
which
he
had
in
the
of
his
coat
preserved
his
life
by
stopping
a
bullet
which
another
boy
had
accidentally
discharged
from
a
pistol
and
that
he
then
had
resolved
to
make
the
honoring
of
the
bible
the
duty
of
his
whole
life
neither
of
these
persons
can
be
regarded
as
insane
both
were
the
subjects
of
acquired
eccentricity
which
in
all
likelihood
would
have
ensued
in
some
other
form
from
some
other
circumstance
acting
upon
brains
naturally
predisposed
to
be
thus
affected
the
brain
is
the
soil
upon
which
impressions
act
differently
according
to
its
character
just
as
with
the
sower
casting
his
upon
different
fields
some
springs
up
into
a
luxuriant
crop
some
grows
sparsely
and
some
again
takes
no
root
but
rots
where
it
falls
possibly
if
these
individuals
had
lived
a
little
longer
they
might
have
passed
the
which
separates
mental
soundness
from
mental
unsoundness
but
certainly
up
to
the
period
of
their
deaths
both
would
have
been
pronounced
sane
by
all
competent
laymen
and
alienists
with
whom
they
might
have
been
brought
into
contact
and
the
contest
of
their
wills
by
any
would
assuredly
have
been
a
fruitless
undertaking
they
chose
to
have
certain
ends
in
view
and
to
provide
the
means
for
the
accomplishment
of
those
ends
there
were
no
delusions
no
emotional
disturbance
no
hallucinations
or
illusions
and
the
will
was
normally
exercised
to
the
extent
necessary
to
secure
the
objects
of
their
lives
at
any
time
they
had
it
in
their
power
to
alter
their
purposes
and
in
that
fact
we
have
an
essential
point
of
difference
between
eccentricity
and
insanity
we
may
regard
their
conduct
as
singular
because
they
made
an
unusual
disposition
of
their
property
but
it
was
no
more
irrational
than
if
the
one
had
left
his
estate
to
the
society
for
the
prevention
of
cruelty
to
animals
and
the
other
had
devoted
his
to
sending
missionaries
to
central
africa
two
distinct
forms
of
eccentricity
are
recognizable
in
the
one
the
individual
sets
himself
up
above
the
level
of
the
rest
of
the
world
and
marking
out
for
himself
a
line
of
conduct
adheres
to
it
with
an
astonishing
degree
of
tenacity
for
him
the
opinions
of
mankind
in
general
are
of
no
consequence
he
is
a
law
unto
himself
what
he
says
and
does
is
said
and
done
not
for
the
purpose
of
attracting
attention
or
for
obtaining
notoriety
but
because
it
is
pleasing
to
himself
he
does
not
mean
to
be
singular
or
original
but
he
is
nevertheless
both
for
every
man
is
singular
and
original
whose
conduct
within
the
limits
of
reason
and
intelligence
differs
from
that
of
his
he
endeavors
to
carry
out
certain
ideas
which
seem
to
him
to
have
been
overlooked
by
society
to
its
great
disadvantage
society
usually
thinks
different
but
if
the
promulgator
is
endowed
with
sufficient
force
of
character
it
generally
happens
that
eventually
either
wholly
or
in
part
his
views
prevail
all
great
reformers
are
eccentrics
of
this
kind
they
are
contending
for
their
doctrines
not
for
themselves
and
they
are
not
apt
to
become
insane
though
sometimes
they
do
the
subjects
of
the
other
form
occupy
a
lower
level
they
affect
singularity
for
the
purpose
of
attracting
attention
to
themselves
and
thus
obtaining
the
notoriety
which
they
crave
with
every
breath
they
inhale
they
dress
differently
from
other
people
wearing
enormous
or
peculiar
hats
or
oddly
cut
coats
of
unusual
colors
or
indulging
in
some
other
similar
whimsicality
of
an
unimportant
character
in
the
expectation
that
they
will
thereby
attract
the
attention
or
excite
the
comments
of
those
they
meet
or
they
build
houses
upon
an
idea
perhaps
correct
enough
in
itself
as
for
instance
the
securing
of
proper
ventilation
but
in
carrying
it
out
they
show
such
defective
judgment
that
the
complete
integrity
of
the
intellect
may
perhaps
be
a
matter
of
question
thus
one
gentleman
of
my
acquaintance
believing
that
fireplaces
were
the
best
ventilators
put
four
of
these
openings
into
every
room
in
his
house
this
however
was
one
of
the
smallest
of
his
eccentricities
he
wore
a
ventilated
hat
his
clothing
was
pierced
with
holes
as
were
even
his
shoes
and
no
one
could
be
in
his
company
five
minutes
without
having
his
attention
directed
to
these
provisions
for
securing
health
in
addition
to
these
advanced
notions
on
the
subject
of
ventilation
he
had
others
equally
singular
in
regard
to
the
arrangement
of
the
furniture
in
his
dwelling
and
the
care
that
was
to
be
taken
of
it
thus
there
was
one
room
called
the
apostles
room
it
contained
a
table
that
represented
christ
and
twelve
chairs
which
were
placed
around
it
and
typified
the
twelve
apostles
one
chair
that
stood
for
judas
iscariot
was
covered
with
black
crape
the
floor
of
this
room
was
very
highly
polished
and
no
one
was
allowed
to
enter
it
without
slipping
his
shod
feet
into
cloth
slippers
that
were
placed
at
the
door
ready
for
use
he
had
a
library
tolerably
large
but
of
little
value
and
every
book
in
it
which
contained
judas
name
was
bound
in
black
and
black
lines
were
drawn
around
the
name
wherever
it
occurred
such
eccentricity
as
this
is
not
far
removed
from
insanity
and
is
liable
at
any
time
from
some
cause
a
little
out
of
the
common
way
to
pass
over
the
line
thus
a
lady
had
since
her
childhood
shown
a
singularity
of
conduct
as
regarded
her
table
furniture
which
she
would
have
of
no
other
material
than
copper
she
carried
this
fancy
to
such
an
extent
that

people
laughed
at
her
and
tried
to
reason
her
out
of
her
whim
but
in
vain
she
was
in
her
element
as
soon
as
attention
was
directed
to
her
fancy
and
arguments
against
it
were
addressed
to
her
she
liked
nothing
better
than
to
be
afforded
a
full
opportunity
to
discuss
with
any
one
the
manifold
advantages
which
copper
possessed
as
a
material
to
be
used
in
the
manufacture
of
every
article
of
table
ware
in
no
other
respect
was
there
any
evidence
of
mental
aberration
she
was
intelligent
by
no
means
excitable
and
in
the
enjoyment
of
excellent
health
she
had
moreover
a
decided
talent
for
music
and
had
written
several
passably
good
stories
for
a
young
magazine
an
uncle
had
however
died
insane
a
circumstance
trifling
in
itself
but
one
as
it
afterward
resulted
of
great
importance
to
her
started
in
her
a
new
train
of
thought
and
excited
emotions
which
she
could
not
control
she
read
in
a
morning
paper
that
a
koppermann
had
arrived
at
one
of
the
hotels
and
she
announced
her
determination
to
call
upon
him
in
order
as
she
said
to
ascertain
the
origin
of
his
name
her
friends
endeavored
to
dissuade
her
but
without
avail
she
went
to
the
hotel
and
was
told
that
he
had
just
left
for
chicago
without
returning
to
her
home
she
bought
a
railway
ticket
for
chicago
and
actually
started
on
the
next
train
for
that
city
the
telegraph
however
overtook
her
and
she
was
brought
back
from
rochester
raving
of
her
love
for
a
man
she
had
never
seen
and
whose
name
alone
had
been
associated
in
her
mind
with
her
fancy
for
copper
table
furniture
she
died
of
acute
mania
within
a
month
in
this
case
erotic
tendencies
which
had
never
been
observed
in
her
before
seemed
to
have
been
excited
by
some
very
indirect
and
complicated
mental
process
and
these
in
their
turn
developed
into
general
derangement
of
the
mind
in
another
case
a
young
man
a
clerk
in
a
city
bank
had
for
several
years
exhibited
peculiarities
in
the
keeping
of
his
books
he
was
exceedingly
exact
in
his
accounts
but
after
the
bank
was
closed
always
remained
several
hours
during
which
he
ornamented
each
page
of
his
day
work
with
arabesques
in
inks
he
was
very
vain
of
this
accomplishment
and
was
constantly
in
the
habit
of
calling
attention
to
the
manner
in
which
as
he
supposed
he
had
beautified
what
would
otherwise
have
been
positively
ugly
his
amused
themselves
at
his
expense
but
his
superior
officers
knowing
his
value
never
interfered
with
him
in
his
amusement
gradually
however
he
conceived
the
idea
that
they
were
displeased
with
him
and
at
last
the
notion
became
so
firmly
rooted
in
his
mind
that
he
resigned
his
position
notwithstanding
the
protestations
of
the
directors
that
his
idea
was
erroneous
delusions
of
various
other
kinds
supervened
and
he
passed
into
a
condition
of
chronic
insanity
in
which
he
still
remains
in
most
of
the
cases
occurring
under
this
head
the
intellectual
powers
are
not
of
a
high
order
though
there
may
sometimes
be
a
notable
development
of
some
talent
or
even
a
great
power
for
acquiring
learning
painters
sculptors
musicians
mathematicians
poets
and
men
of
letters
generally
not
infrequently
exhibit
eccentricities
of
dress
conduct
manner
or
ideas
which
not
only
merely
add
to
their
notoriety
but
often
make
them
either
the
of
their
or
objects
of
fear
or
disgust
to
all
who
are
brought
into
contact
with
them
by
idiosyncrasy
we
understand
a
peculiarity
of
constitution
by
which
an
individual
is
affected
by
external
agents
in
a
manner
different
from
mankind
in
general
thus
some
persons
can
not
eat
strawberries
without
a
kind
of
urticaria
appearing
over
the
body
others
are
similarly
affected
by
eating
the
striped
bass
others
again
faint
at
the
odor
of
certain
flowers
or
at
the
sight
of
blood
and
some
are
attacked
with
after
eating
shellfish
as
crabs
lobsters
clams
or
mussels
many
other
instances
might
be
advanced
some
of
them
of
a
very
curious
character
these
several
conditions
are
called
idiosyncrasies
bégin
who
defines
idiosyncrasy
as
the
predominance
of
an
organ
a
viscus
or
a
system
of
organs
has
hardly
i
think
fairly
grasped
the
subject
though
his
definition
has
influenced
many
french
writers
on
the
question
it
is
something
more
than
this
something
inherent
in
the
organization
of
the
individual
of
which
we
only
see
the
manifestation
when
the
proper
cause
is
set
in
action
we
can
not
attempt
to
explain
why
one
person
should
be
severely
mercurialized
by
one
grain
of
blue
mass
and
another
take
daily
ten
times
that
quantity
for
a
week
without
the
least
sign
of
the
peculiar
action
of
mercury
being
produced
we
only
know
that
such
is
the
fact
and
were
we
to
search
for
the
reason
with
all
the
appliances
which
modern
science
could
bring
to
our
aid
we
should
be
entirely
unsuccessful
according
to
bégin
idea
we
should
expect
to
see
some
remarkable
development
of
the
absorbent
system
in
the
one
case
with
slight
development
in
the
other
but
even
were
such
the
case
it
would
not
explain
the
phenomena
for
when
ten
grains
of
the
preparation
in
question
are
taken
daily
scarcely
a
day
elapses
before
mercury
can
be
detected
in
the
secretions
and
yet
hydrargyriasis
is
not
produced
while
when
one
grain
is
taken
and
this
condition
follows
the
most
delicate
chemical
examination
fails
to
discover
mercury
in
any
of
the
fluids
or
tissues
of
the
body

appear
to
be

reasoning
based
upon
an
enlarged
idea
of

a

exists
idiosyncrasies
are
often
hereditary

two

there
may

another
with
the

system
another
with
the
nervous
system
and
so
on
an
idiosyncrasy
may
be
of
such
a
character
as
altogether
to
prevent
an
individual
following
a
particular
occupation
thus
a

who
faints
at

can
not
be
a

another
who

not

to
which
they

for
the

idiosyncrasies
may
be

only
that
is
due

whether

are

at

time
under

who
at
the
beginning
of

acquired
an
overpowering
aversion
to
a
indian
woman
who
was
employed
in
the
house
as
a
servant
whenever
this
woman
came
near
her
she
was
at
once
seized
with
violent
trembling
which
ended
in
a
few
minutes
with
vomiting
and
great
mental
and
physical
prostration
lasting
several
hours
her
husband
would
have
sent
the
woman
away
but
x
insisted
on
her
remaining
as
she
was
a
good
servant
in
order
that
she
might
overcome
what
she
regarded
as
an
unreasonable
prejudice
the
effort
was
however
too
much
for
her
for

when
the

entered

unexpectedly
the

became
greatly
excited

the
indian

bring

paroxysm

it
was
not

after
her
confinement
that
the
antipathy
disappeared
millingen
remarks
that
certain
antipathies
which
in
reality
are
idiosyncrasies
appear
to
depend
upon
peculiarities
of
the
senses
rather
however
they
are
due

peculiarities
of

it
is
higher

the

some
conditions
often
called
idiosyncrasies
appear

be

doubtless
are
due

disordered
intellect
but
they
should
not
be
confounded
with
those
which
are
inherent
in
the
individual
and
real
in
character
thus
they
are
frequently
merely
imaginary
there
being
no
foundation
for
them
except
in
the
perverted
mind
of
the
subject
at
other
times
they
are
induced
by
a
morbid
attention
being
directed
continually
to
some
one
or
more
organs
or
functions
the
protean
forms
under
which
hypochondria
appears
and
the
still
more
varied
manifestations
of
hysteria
are
rather
due
to
the
reaction
ensuing
between
mental
disorder
on
the
one
part
and
functional
disorder
on
the
other
than
to
that
quasi
normal
peculiarity
of
organization
recognized
as
idiosyncrasy
thus
upon
one
occasion
i
was
consulted
in
the
case
of
a
lady
who
it
was
said
had
an
idiosyncrasy
that
prevented
her
drinking
water
every
time
she
took
the
smallest
quantity
of
this
liquid
into
her
stomach
it
was
at
once
rejected
with
many
evident
signs
of
nausea
and
pain
the
patient
was
strongly
hysterical
and
i
soon
made
up
my
mind
that
either
the
case
was
one
of
simple
hysterical
vomiting
or
that
the
alleged
inability
was
assumed
the
latter
turned
out
to
be
the
truth
i
found
that
she
drank
in
private
all
the
water
she
wanted
and
that
what
she
drank
publicly
she
threw
up
by
tickling
the
fauces
with
her
when
no
one
was
looking
the
idiosyncrasies
of
individuals
are
not
matters
for
ridicule
however
absurd
they
may
appear
to
be
on
the
contrary
they
deserve
and
should
receive
the
careful
consideration
of
the
physician
for
much
is
to
be
learned
from
them
both
in
preventing
and
in
treating
diseases
in
psychiatrical
medicine
they
are
especially
to
be
inquired
for
it
is
not
safe
to
disregard
them
as
they
may
influence
materially
the
character
of
mental
derangement
and
may
be
brought
in
as
efficient
agents

observes
upon
the

of
one
of
the
lower

a
dark
purplish
ring
encircling
the
neck
from
to

sixteenth
of

inch
in
depth

tooth
is
white
and

he
shows
the
condition
to
the
patient
and
taking
up
an
excavator
endeavors
to
pass
it
down
between
the
tooth
and
gum
on
the
labial
surface
after
it
gets
down
a
little
way
the
instrument
meets
with
an
obstruction
over
which
calling
the
attention
to
the
fact
he
carefully
guides
the
instrument
until
it
drops
down
on
the
beyond
it
then
turning
the
instrument
and
pressing
it
upward
he
breaks
off
a
portion
of
the
concretion
which
proves
to
be
what
is
ordinarily
called
or
tartar
that
is
the
cause
of
the
purple
ring
on
the
gum
which
is
merely
the
outward
manifestation
of
the
disease
take
it
off
thoroughly
polish
the
surface
of
the
tooth
and
in
three
days
time
the
gum
will
show
a
perfectly
healthy
color
the
condition
described
is
the
first
stage
of
the
disease
and
the
treatment
given
is
all
that
is
required
for
a
cure
of
the
case
at
this
time
but
take
the
same
man
and
let
him
go
for
ten
years
without
the
simple
operation
detailed
the
disease
spreads
and
causes
inflammation
of
the
process
and
finally
its

sometimes
on
the
labial
surface

work
the
tooth
is
loose

the
concretion
is
gone
in
whole
or
in
part
in
this
case
the
patient
wants
the
tooth
out
but
he
asks
what
has
become
of
the
tartar
the
answer
is
that
the
natural
acids
found
in
the
oral
cavity
have
dissolved
it
and
it
has
passed
into
the
stomach
or
out

entirely
loose
almost
ready

it
hurts
so
that
he
can
not
bear
the
pain
the

taken
out
there
is
no
tartar
on
it

very
little
there
is
a
little
speck

the
point
of

the
apex
is
as
sharp
as
a
needle
after
the
disease
has
done
its
work
of
separating

from

the
destroying
agent
begins
to
absorb
the

at
the

irregularly
causing
the
sharpness
described
now
because
no

is
found
upon
the
tooth
does
that
argue
that
it
has
never
been
there
not
at
all
the
loosened
tooth
shows
simply
that
it
has
been
there
and
has
been
absorbed
the
speaker
has
never
seen
a
tooth
in
that
condition
on
the
point
of
which
he
could
not
show
patches
or
specks
we
may
not
see
the
tartar
but
it
certainly
once
existed
there
and
has
accomplished
its
work
now
suppose
we
find
a
patient
with
all
the
teeth
loosened
he
has
neuralgia
pains
in
the
face
for
which
medicine
seems
to
furnish
no
remedy
he
has
also
catarrh
and
the
malar
and
nasal
bones
are
all
affected
in
the
third
and
fourth
stages
a
low
inflammatory
action
pervades
all
the
bones
of
the
face
accompanied
by
neuralgic
pains
extending
to
the
brain
itself
in
such
a
case
the
disease
of
the
teeth
intensifies
the
catarrh
a
medical
man
called
upon
him
for
treatment
for
pyorrhea
alveolaris
the
patient
was
also
afflicted
with
catarrh
he
cured
the
pyorrhea
alveolaris
and
cured
the
catarrh
too
at
the
same
time
another
a
lady
called
in
great
distress
nearly
all
her
teeth
were
affected
and
the
discharge
was
most
offensive
and
abundant
if
she
lay
on
her
side
in
bed
the
pillow
would
be
covered
with
large
splotches
of
the
discharge
in
the
morning
if
she
lay
on
her
back
the
mass
was
swallowed
and
the
result
was
that
the
whole
alimentary
canal
was
demoralized
by
the
pus
blood
and
vitiated
secretions
when
she
arose
she
wanted
no
breakfast
only
two
or
three
cups
of
strong
coffee
and
some
crackers
she
was
nearly
blind
could
only
see
a
great
light
and
was
totally
unable
to
see
to
read
he
told
her
that
the
trouble
with
her
sight
was
caused
by
the
diseased
condition
of
the
teeth
that
unless
that
was
remedied
she
might
live
three
months
but
she
would
die
suddenly
he
treated
three
or
four
teeth
at
a
time
at
each
sitting
this
consumed
three
weeks
the
teeth
became
firm
her
appetite
returned
her
sight
was
restored
and
she
was
able
to
walk
a
mile
or
two
without
disturbance
he
was
called
to
brooklyn
where
they
had
a
live
society
and
an
infirmary
for
the
treatment
of
dental
diseases
at
which
members
of
the
society
were
delegated
to
attend
from
day
to
day
he
was
invited
to
give
a
clinic
upon
pyorrhea
alveolaris
and
he
told
them
of
this
patient
whom
he
showed
to
some
fifteen
members
the
woman
was
apparently
in
fair
health
it
was
not
loss
of
which
started
the
disease
in
this
case
but
the
disease
caused
the
loss
of
appetite
and
the
vitiated
condition
of
the
whole
alimentary
canal
her
physician
would
have
sent
this
woman
to
the
grave
not
recognizing
the
disease
and
its
management
he
maintains
that
it
is
not
lack
of
nervous
energy
that
causes
this
disease
but
the
disease
will
lead
to
loss
of
that
small
purple
ring
on
the
gum
of
the
cuspid
in
the
case
first
mentioned
would
eventually
have
led
to
the
loss
of
the
whole
set
if
left
to
work
its
way
unopposed
he
had
tried
in
these
remarks
to
controvert
the
old
ideas
and
to
present
the
cause
of
the
disease
and
its
treatment
as
he
sees
it
you
may
see
it
differently
if
so
give
us
your
information
in
order
that
we
may
correct
our
views
if
wrong
one
gentleman
says
he
finds
it
is
only
those
who
are
strong
and
vigorous
who
have
this
disease
the
speaker
finds
some
cases
of
this
kind
he
also
finds
consumptives
who
have
not
a
trace
of
it
but
he
would
take
the
strongest
man
in
the
room
and
cause
a
beautiful
case
of
pyorrhea
alveolaris
in
his
mouth
in
three
weeks
with
a
fine
cotton
thread
tied
around
one
of
the
lower
front
teeth
at
the
line
of
the
gum
the
thread
will
work
its
way
under
the
gum
and
the
gum
will
become
inflamed
it
will
work
its
way
down
between
the
gum
and
the
tooth
and
in
the
meantime
the
flour
and
the
particles
of
food
will
also
work
down
under
the
loose
gum
finding
a
on
the
thread
the
mass
will
become
impregnated
with
and
will
then
begin
to
harden
and
in
a
very
short
time
you
will
have
an
excellent
example
of
the
disease
under
discussion
patients
suffering
from
salivation
fall
an
easy
prey
to
this
disease
due
to
the
action
of
the
drug
on
the
glands
and
the
hard
and
soft
tissues
of
the
mouth
the
gums
in
such
cases
affording
a
ready
pocket
under
their
edges
for
the
deposits
when
you
find
a
tooth
with
the
characteristic
concretion
of
tartar
upon
it
the
first
principle
of
surgery
demands
that
you
clean
that
tooth
thoroughly
go
down
beyond
the
line
of
the
disease
go
around
the
tooth
thoroughly
and
break
up
the
diseased
tissue
and
apply
tincture
of
myrrh
and
in
three
days
you
will
notice
a
marked
improvement
for
the
better
and
if
the
patient
takes
proper
care
of
the
teeth
the
disease
will
not
return
practitioners
should
watch
the
teeth
of
the
young
people
under
their
care
and
see
that
the
mouth
is
kept
scrupulously
clean
and
healthy
in
reply
to
a
question
riggs
stated
that
whenever
absorption
goes
on
irregularly
unless
the
inflammatory
action
is
extreme
it
will
sometimes
absorb
one
or
two
and
then
skip
one
or
two
and
these
last
being
isolated
naturally
die
or
become
necrosed
to
some
extent
in
treating
this
disease
you
must
break
up
the
line
of
disintegrated
tissue
you
must
as
it
were
transfer
your
eyesight
to
the
end
of
the
instrument
so
that
when
you
strike
dead
bone
you
will
know
it
live
bone
will
feel
smooth
and
greasy
it
requires
some
years
of
experience
to
treat
this
disease
properly
because
you
have
not
your
eyesight
to
aid
you
but
must
depend
absolutely
upon
the
sense
of
touch
with
experience
however
you
will
learn
to
give
a
great
deal
of
relief
in
one
of
the
most
annoying
conditions
to
which
the
teeth
are
subject
the
reason
the
profession
are
not
familiar
with
the
treatment
of
this
disease
is
they
fail
to
recognize
it
until
it
reaches
its
third
or
fourth
stage
and
then
they
treat
it
by
depletion
and
therapeutic
remedies
some
treat
it
by
stippling
in
acids
underneath
the
gum
thinking
thereby
to
dissolve
away
not
only
the
tartar
but
the
necrosed
bone
another
writer
takes
off
patches
of
the
diseased
tissue
and
another
a
strip
of
the
gum
from
to
this
treatment
he
could
only
characterize
as
simply
barbarous
the
treatment
of
this
disease
is
purely
surgical
any
therapeutic
treatment
is
to
alleviate
the
pain
and
soreness
immediately
after
the
operation
morrison
louis
referring
to
the
method
of
treating
pyorrhea
alveolaris
described
by
riggs
said
he
cheerfully
bore
testimony
to
the
importance
of
loosening
the
scales
of
tartar
and
teaching
patients
the
value
of
cleanness
of
the
mouth
in
his
experience
he
had
found
that
all
instruments
will
occasionally
fail
to
dislodge
the
deposit
in
such
cases
he
used
as
an
assistant
a
little
ring
of
para
gum
about
an
eighth
of
an
inch
wide
this
was
sprung
on
the
tooth
at
the
edge
of
the
gum
if
this
is
done
and
the
ring
allowed
to
remain
a
few
hours
you
will
see
an
entirely
new
revelation
and
you
will
readily
be
able
to
get
at
the
tooth
to
clean
it
he

found
it
advisable
to
give
patients

how
the

be
used
sulphur
as
a
preservative
against
marsh
fever
at
a
recent
meeting
of
the
paris
academy
called
attention
to
some
facts
regarding
marsh
fever
which
african
travelers
and
others
might
do
well
to
ponder
some
elephant
hunters
from
plateaus
with
comparatively
cool
climate
brave
the
hottest
and
most
deleterious
ethiopian
regions
with
impunity
which
they
attribute
to
their
habit
of
daily
fumigation
of
the
naked
body
with
sulphur
it
was
interesting
to
know
whether
sulphurous
emanations
received
involuntarily
have
a
like
effect
from
inquiries
made
by
fouqué
it
appears
that
in
sicily
while
most
of
the
sulphur
mines
are
in
high
districts
and
free
from
malaria
a
few
are
at
a
low
level
where
intermittent
fever
prevails
in
the
latter
districts
while
the
population
of
the
neighboring
villages
is
attacked
by
fever
in
the
proportion
of

the
workmen
in
the

less
not
more
than

nine

being
attacked
again
on
a
certain
marshy
plain
near
the
roadstead
in
the
island
of
milo
grecian
archipelago
it
is
hardly
possible
to
spend
a
night
without
being
attacked
by
intermittent
fever
yet
on
the
very
fertile
part
near
the
mountains
are
the
ruins
of
a
large
and
prosperous
town

which
years
ago
numbered
about
inhabitants
owing
to
the
ravages
of
marsh
fever
the
place
is
now
nearly
deserted
one
naturally
asks
how
such
a
town
grew
to
its
former
populous
state
sulphur
mining
has
been
an
important
source
of
wealth
in
milo
from
the
time
of
the
ancient
greeks
up
to
the
end
of
last
century
the
sulphur
was
chiefly
extracted
at
kalamo
but
since
that
time
it
has
only
been
mined
on
the
east
coast
of
the
island
the
decadence
of
zephyria
has
nearly
corresponded
to
this
transference
the

part
of
this
century
because
of

yet
there
is
a
colony
of
workmen
living
about

they
seem
to
be
advantageously

the

a

the

the

is
placed
opposite
an
upright

whose

serves
as
a
guide

whose

which

itself
connected
with
the
cranked
shaft
this
shaft
has
for
its
bearings
two
supports
b
attached
to
the
reservoir
and
carries
the
driving
pulleys
and
a
fly
wheel
the
beam

having
to
give
motion
to
the
piston
in
describing
an
arc
of
a
circle
at
the
extremity
attached
to
the
connecting
rod
must
for
that
reason
have
a
fixed
point
of
oscillation
or
one
that
we
must
consider
as
such
for
the
instant
now
such
point
is
selected
on
a
piece
h
having
the
shape
of
the
letter
c
and
which
plays
an
important
part
in
the
working
of
the
pump
this
piece
is
really
a
lever
having
its
center
of
oscillation
in
two
brackets
c
at
the
base
of
the
reservoir
fig
shows
the
relation
of
the
beam
f
and
lever
the
upper
extremity
of
this
latter
is
forked
and
embraces
the
beam
f
whose
external
surfaces
are
provided
with
two
slots

to
move

attached

of

shown
in

on
the
line
in

and
on
the
line
in

things
thus
arranged
if
we
suppose
the
piece
h
absolutely
stationary
it
is
clear
that
as
the
oscillation
of
the
beam
f
is
effected
on
the
studs
f
as
centers
the
piston
of
the
pump
will
perform
an
invariable
travel
whose
extent
will
be
dependent
upon
its
position
between
such
point
of
oscillation
and
the
point
of
articulation
of
the
connecting
rod
but
we
must
observe
that
even
according
to
such
a
hypothesis
the
point
f
would
not
be
entirely
stationary
because
the
point
of
articulation
a
upon
the
piston
rod
being
obliged
to
follow
an
invariably
straight
line
the
slots
d
will
have
to
undergo
an
alternate
sliding
motion
on
the
slides
e
save
be
it
understood
when
the
latter
are
brought
to
coincide
exactly
with
the
center
of
articulation
a
now
we
shall
in
fact
see
that
the
point
f
can
move
forward
in
following
the
slots
d
and
that
it
may
even
reach
the
point
of
articulation
a
of
the
beam
f
on
the
rod
e
that
is
to
say
occupy
the
position
shown
in
fig
where
the
oscillation
of
the
beam
f
being
effected
according
to
the
point
a
the
stroke
of
the
piston
has
become
absolutely
null
the
position
of
the
piece
h
is
in
effect
variable
with
the
pressures
that
are
manifested
in
the
pump
it
will
be
seen
that
the
latter
has
a
tubular
appendage
g
in
whose
interior
there
plays
what
is
called
a
starting
rod
h
which
is
constantly
submitted
to
the
pressures
existing
in
the
interior
of
the
pump
and
which
rests
against
the
lower
arm
of
the
piece
but
this
latter
is
also
loaded
at
the
opposite
side
with
heavy
counterpoises
i
which
counterbalance
within
a
determinate
limit
the
action
of
the
rod
h
that
tends
constantly
to
cause
the
lever
h
to
oscillate
around
its
pivot
in
the
brackets
to
sum
up
then
as
long
as
the
pressure
in
the
pump
has
not
reached
a
determinate
limit
the
lever
h
held
by
its
counterpoises
will
keep
the
position
shown
in
fig
and
for
which
the
center
of
oscillation
f
corresponds
with
the
maximum
stroke
of
the
pump
piston
but
as
soon
as
such
limit
is
exceeded
the
equilibrium
being
broken
the
action
of
the
rod
h
predominates
the
piece
h
reverses
from
right
to
left
the
point
of
oscillation
f
moves
forward
in
the
slots
d
and
the
stroke
of
the
piston
is
reduced
just
so
much
if
finally
the
pressure
continues
to
increase
the
motion
of
the
piece
h
will
continue
and
the
point
of
oscillation
f
will
reach
the
position
for
which
the
motion
of
the
piston
ceases
completely
fig
but
it
results
further
therefrom
that
if
when
such
position
is
reached
the
pressure
diminishes
the
lever
h
will
under
the
influence
of
its
counterpoise
tend
to
return
to
its
first
position
and
thus
set
the
piston
in
motion
as
we
remarked
in
the
beginning
the
automatism
of
these
functions
is
absolutely
complete
it
will
be
remarked
that
the
piece
h
is
provided
with
an
appendage
whose
interior
forms
a
rack
this
rack
engages
with
a
pinion
i
mounted
on
an
axle
j
which
carries
externally
a
fly
wheel
this
axle
j
moves
with
the
various
displacements
of
the
lever
and
its
fly
wheel
overcomes
by
its
inertia
all
backward
and
forward
shocks
resulting
from
the
thrusts
due
to
the
sliding
of
the
steel
slides
in
the
different
positions
of
the
connecting
rods
such
shocks
would
make
themselves
especially
felt
while
the
dead
centers
were
being

history
of
the
fire
extinguisher
the
first
fire
extinguishers
were
of
the
annihilator
pattern
so
arranged
in
a
building
that
when
a
fire
occurred
carbonic
acid
gas
was
evolved
and
if
the
conditions
were
right
as
the
mediums
say
the
fire
was
put
out
it
worked
very
nicely
at
experimental
fires
built
for
the
purpose
but
was
apt
to
fail
in
case
of
an
involuntary
conflagration
about
the
year
a
patent
was
granted
to
carlier
and
vignon
of
france
for
an
apparatus
in
which
water
saturated
with
carbonic
acid
gas
was
projected
upon
the
fire
by
the
expansive
force
of
the
gas
itself
as
the
apparatus
was
portable
and
the
stream
could
be
directed
to
any
point
it
was
obviously
the
desideratum
needed
miles
of
boston
purchased
the
american
patent
and
subsequently
sold
the
territory
exclusive
of
new
england
to
the
babcock
who
at
the
time
had
a
crude
apparatus
of
their
own
the
first
machines
sold
under
the
new
patent
were
filled
with
water
and
loaded
with
cartridges
of
dry
acid
and
bicarbonate
of
soda
the
cap
screwed
down
hastily
and
as
the
chemicals
dissolved
the
gas
was
generated
the
pressure
raised
and
the
water
charged
by
absorption
the
pressure
of
some
pounds
was
sufficient
to
project
a
stream
feet
or
more
and
the
machine
was
set
upon
the
shelf
so
as
to
be
ready
for
any
fire
that
might
occur
in
many
cases
however
the
pressure
escaped
after
a
short
time
and
the
machine
when
needed
was
found
to
be
useless
the
most
important
step
in
the
evolution
of
the
modern
extinguisher
was
the
adoption
of
a
device
for
mixing
liquid
acid
with
the
soda
solution
by
the
turning
of
a
handle
or
screw
the
alarm
was
given
this
was
a
practical
machine
and
proved
of
such
value
that
an
immense
business
was
built
up
the
result
of
this
prosperity
was
the
development
of
new
companies
with
new
devices
for
accomplishing
the
same
result
which
were
successfully
offered
to
the
public
with
varying
success
as
these
were
direct
infringements
upon
the
patent
rights
acquired
by
the
babcock
company
their
encroachments
were
resisted
in
the
courts
and
much
money
was
spent
in
the
effort
of
the
company
to
sustain
their
rights
including
the
purchase
of
the
patents
of
several
rival
machines
that
possessed
real
merit
or
whose
business
was
worth
controlling
among
these
purchases
was
the
right
and
good
will
of
the
national
extinguisher
who
used
an
acid
cartridge
of
glass
the
acid
being
liberated
by
breaking
the
glass
this
feature
united
with
important
improvements
in
general
construction
and
the
use
of
a
peculiar
glass
bottle
instead
of
a
tube
is
the
babcock
machine
of
the
combination
making
the
simplest
and
most
effective
and
reliable
apparatus
ever
built
in
the
meantime
an
investigation
before
the
courts
brought
out
the
fact
that
the
french
patent
was
antedated
by
an
american
invention
for
which
a
patent
was
applied
by
a
graham
in
and
which
possessed
the
essential
features
of
the
principle
in
dispute
graham
through
lack
of
means
or
for
some
other
reason
had
failed
to
perfect
his
papers
up
to
the
time
of
his
death
and
as
the
invention
was
one
of
obvious
importance
a
bill
was
passed
through
congress
for
the
reopening
of
the
case
and
the
patent
was
issued
to
the
graham
heirs
in
soon
after
the
issue
of
the
graham
patent
several

firms
viz

the

were
licensed
to

under
the
patent
by

as

who
bound
himself
in
these
licenses
to
issue
no
other
licenses
except
with
the
approval
of
all
those
who
were
included
in
the

left

manufacturers
out
in
the
cold
and
one
of
these
in
investigating
the
status
of
extinguisher
patents
at
washington
discovered
an
assignment
of
a
quarter
interest
of
the
graham
patent
to
a
burton
who
at
the
time
of
graham
second
application
for
a
patent
had
assisted
him
with
this
assignment
had
long
been
forgotten
burton
having
died
and
his
heirs
knowing
nothing
of
its
existence
the
widow
of
burton
was
hunted
up
an
assignment
was
secured
for
and
a
consolidated
fire
extinguisher
company
was
formed
which
became
the
owner
of
the
one
quarter
interest
in
the
patent
this
combination
known
as
the
fire
extinguisher
manufacturing
included
the
protective
annihilator
of
new
york
the
northampton
fire
extinguisher
co
of
northampton
mass
and
the
north
american
fire
annihilator
of
philadelphia
the
combination
bought
out
the
babcock
who
had
already
acquired
the
patents
of
the
champion
all
the

of
the
conellies
of
pittsburg
and
of
the
great
american
of
louisville

the
advantages
of
the
chemical
engine
are
well
summed
up
in
the
following
statement
the
superiority
of
a
chemical
engine
consists
in
its
simplicity
it
dispenses
with
complex
machinery
experienced
engineers
reservoirs
and
steam
carbonic
acid
gas
is
both
the
working
and
extinguishing
agent
in
promptness
it
is
always
ready
no
steam
to
be
raised
no
fire
to
be
kindled
no
hose
to
be
laid
and
no
large
company
to
be
mustered
the
chemicals
are
kept
in
place
and
the
gas
generated
the
instant
wanted
in
half
the
cases
the
time
thus
saved
is
a
building
saved
five
minutes
at
the
right
time
are
worth
five
hours
a
little
later
in
efficiency
mere
water
inadequately
applied
feeds
the
fire
but
carbonic
acid
gas
never
bulk
for
bulk
it
is
forty
times
as
effective
as
water
the
seventy
gallons
of
the
two
smallest
cylinders
being
equal
to
hundred
gallons
of
water
besides
it
uses
the
only
agent
that
will
extinguish
burning
tar
oil
and
other
combustible
fluids
and
vapors
one
cylinder
can
be
recharged
while
the
other
is
working
thus
keeping
up
a
continuous
stream
in
convenience
five
or
six
men
can
draw
it
and
manage
it
its
small
dimensions
require
but
small
area
either
for
work
or
storage
one
hundred
feet
or
more
of
its
light
pliant
hose
can
be
carried
on
a
arm
up
any
number
of
stairs
inside
a
building
or
if
fire
forbids
up
a
ladder
outside
in
saving
from
destruction
by
water
what
the
fire
has
spared
it
smothers
but
does
not
deluge
the
modicum
of
water
used
to
give
momentum
to
the
gas
is
soon
evaporated
by
the
heat
doing
little
or
no
damage
to
what
is
below
this
feature
of
the
engine
is
of
incalculable
worth
to
housekeepers
merchants
and
insurance
companies
economy
it
costs
only
about
half
as
much
as
a
first
class
hand
engine
and
about
as
much
as
a
steam
engine
with
their
necessary
appendages
and
the
chemicals
for
each
charge
cost
less
than
two
dollars
how
to
tow
a
boat
a
correspondent
of
says
those
living
on
swift
streams
and
using
small
boats
often
have
occasion
to
tow
up
stream
so
do
surveyors
hunters
campers
tourists
and
others
one
man
can
tow
a
boat
against
a
swift
current
where
five
could
not
row
where
there
are
two
persons
the
usual
method
is
for
one
to
waste
his
strength
holding
the
boat
off
shore
with
a
pole
while
the
other
tows
where
but
one
person
he
finds
towing
almost
impossible
and
when
bottom
too
muddy
for
poling
and
current
too
swift
for
rowing
he
makes
sad
progress
illustration
the
above
cut
shows
how
one
man
can
easily
tow
alone
the
light
regulating
string
b
passes
from
the
stern
of
the
boat
to
one
hand
of
the
person
towing
the
tow
line
a
is
attached
a
little
in
front
of
the
center
of
the
boat
hence
when
b
is
slackened
the
boat
approaches
the
shore
while
a
very
slight
pull
on
it
turns
the
boat
outward
the
person
towing
glances
back
ever
and
anon
to
observe
the
boat
line
of
travel
railways
of
europe
and
america
the
following
table
which
has
been
prepared
by
the
french
ministry
of
public
works
gives
the
railway
mileage
of
the
various
countries
of
europe
and
the
united
states
up
to
the
end
of
last
year
with
the
number
of
miles
constructed
in
that
year

germany
great

italy
spain
sweden
norway
belgium
switzerland

total
united

it
appears
from
this
that
the
united
states
mileage
was
only
less
than
the
total
of
all
europe
and
at
the
present
time
it
exceeds
it
as
the
former
country
has
built
about
miles
this
year
whereas
europe
has
not
exceeded
the
difference
in
the
number
of
persons
per
mile
in
the
two
cases
is
also
very
great
europe
taking
six
times
as
many
persons
to
support
a
mile
of
railway
as
the
states
and
can
only
be
accounted
for
by
the
fact
that
american
railways
are
constructed
much
cheaper
than
the
european
ones
before
it
happened
at
on
wednesday
september
the
correspondent
of
a
press
agency
dispatched
a
telegram
to
london
with
the
intimation
that
the
great
battle
at
was
practically
over
it
may
possibly
astonish
not
a
few
of
our
readers
says
a
writer
in
the
to
learn
that
this
message
reached
the
metropolis
between
and
on
the
same
morning
and
in
fact
had
an
unbroken
telegraphic
wire
extended
from
kassassin
to
london
sir
garnet
wolseley
great
victory
might
have
been
known
here
at
or
seemingly
at
a
time
when
the
fight
was
raging
and
our
success
far
from
complete
nay
had
the
telegram
been
flashed
straight
to
washington
in
the
united
states
it
would
have
reached
there
something
like
after
the
local
midnight
of
september
paradoxical
as
this
sounds
the
explanation
of
it
is
of
the
most
simple
possible
character
the
rate
at
which
electricity
travels
has
been
very
variously
estimated
fizeau
asserted
that
its
velocity
in
copper
wire
was
miles
a
second
walker
that
it
only
travels
miles
through
that
medium
during
the
same
interval
while
the
experiments
made
in
the
united
states
during
the
determination
of
the
longitudes
of
various
stations
there
still
further
reduced
the
rate
of
motion
to
some
miles
a
second
whichever
of
these
values
we
adopt
however
we
may
take
it
for
our
present
purpose
that
the
transmission
of
a
message
by
the
electric
telegraph
is
practically
instantaneous
but
be
it
here
noted
there
is
no
such
a
thing
as
a
or
common
time
for
the
whole
world
what
is
familiarly
known
as
longitude
is
really
the
difference
in
time
east
or
west
from
a
line
passing
through
the
north
and
south
poles
of
the
earth
and
the
middle
of
the
great
transit
circle
is
the
royal
observatory
at
greenwich
if
in
the
latitude
of
london
we
proceed
miles
and
yards
either
in
an
easterly
or
westerly
direction
we
find
that
the
local
time
is
respectively
either
one
minute
faster
or
one
minute
slower
than
it
was
at
our
initial
point
let
us
try
to
understand
the
reason
of
this
if
we
fix
a
tube
rigidly
at
any
station
on
the
earth
surface
pointing
to
that
part
of
the
sky
in
which
any
bright
star
is
situated
when
such
star
is
due
south
or
as
it
is
technically
called
on
the
meridian
and
note
by
a
good
clock
the
hour
minute
and
second
at
which
it
crosses
a
wire
stretched
vertically
across
the
tube
then
after
a
lapse
of
will
that
star
be
again
threaded
on
the
wire
if
the
earth
were
stationary
or
rather
if
she
had
no
motion
but
that
round
her
axis
this
would
be
the
length
of
our
day
but
as
is
well
known
she
is
revolving
round
the
sun
from
left
to
right
and
as
a
necessary
consequence
the
sun
seems
to
be
revolving
round
her
from
right
to
left
so
that
if
we
suppose
the
sun
and
our
star
to
be
both
on
the
wire
together
the
sun
will
appear
to
have
traveled
to
the
left
of
the
star
in
the
sky
and
the
earth
will
have
that
piece
more
to
turn
upon
her
axis
before
our
tube
comes
up
with
him
again
this
apparent
motion
of
the
sun
in
the
sky
is
not
an
equable
one
sometimes
it
is
faster
sometimes
slower
sometimes
more
slanting
sometimes
more
horizontal
thus
it
comes
to
pass
that
solar
days
or
the
intervals
elapsing
between
one
return
of
the
sun
to
the
meridian
and
another
are
by
no
means
equal
so
a
mean
of
their
lengths
is
taken
by
adding
them
up
for
a
year
and
dividing
by
and
the
quantity
to
be
divided
to
or
subtracted
from
the
instant
of
apparent
noon
when
the
sun
dial
shows
is
set
down
in
the
almanac
under
the
heading
of
the
equation
of
time
we
may
however
here
conceive
that
it
is
noon
everywhere
in
the
northern
hemisphere
when
the
sun
is
due
south
now
the
earth
turns
on
her
axis
from
west
to
east
and
occupies
in
doing
so
as
all
circles
are
conceived
to
be
divided
into
it
is
obvious
that
in
one
hour
must
pass
beneath
the
sun
or
a
star
in
two
hours
and
so
on
the
longitude
of
kassassin
is
roughly
speaking
east
so
that
when
the
sun
is
due
south
there
or
it
is
noon
the
earth
must
go
on
turning
for
two
hours
and
eight
minutes
before
greenwich
comes
under
the
sun
or
it
is
noon
there
which
is
only
another
way
of
saying
that
at
noon
at
kassassin
it
is
at
greenwich
it
is
this
purely
local
character
of
time
which
gives
rise
to
the
seeming
paradox
of
our
being
able
to
receive
news
of
an
event
before
by
our
clocks
it
has
happened
at
all
the
ader
relay
this
new
instrument
has
excited
considerable
interest
among
telegraph
and
telephone
men
by
its
exceeding
sensitiveness
it
is
so
sensitive
to
the
passage
of
an
electric
current
that
a
battery
formed
with
an
ordinary
pin
for
one
electrode
and
a
piece
of
zinc
wire
for
the
other
immersed
in
a
single
drop
of
water
will
give
sufficient
current
to
operate
the
relay
in
practice
it
has
successfully
worked
as
a
telephonic
call
on
the
eastern
railroad
company
line
between
nancy
and
paris
a
distance
of
miles
requiring
but
two
cups
of
ordinary
leclanché
battery
the
instrument
consists
of
two
permanent
horseshoe
magnets
fixed
parallel
with
each
other
and
an
inch
apart
a
very
thin
spool
or
bobbin
of
insulated
wire
is
suspended
like
the
pendulum
of
a
clock
between
these
permanent
magnets
in
such
a
manner
that
the
bobbin
hangs
just
in
front
of
the
four
poles
a
counterpoise
is
fixed
at
the
top
of
the
pendulum
bar
which
permits
the
adjusting
of
the
antagonistic
forces
represented
by
the
action
of
the
swinging
bobbin
and
two
springs
which
are
insulated
from
the
mass
and
which
form
one
electrode
of
the
local
or
annunciator
circuit
while
the
pendulum
bar
forms
the
other
it
will
be
easily
understood
that
as
the
bobbin
hangs
freely
in
the
center
of
a
very
strong
magnetic
field
formed
by
the
four
poles
of
the
two
permanent
magnets
the
slightest
current
sent
through
the
bobbin
will
cause
the
bobbin
to
be
attracted
from
one
direction
while
it
will
be
repelled
from
the
other
according
to
the
polarity
of
the
current
transmitted
as
the
relay
has
a
very
low
resistance
it
is
evident
that
it
will
become
an
acceptable
auxiliary
in
our
central
office
particularly
when
used
as
a
calling
off
signal
as
by
its
use
the
ground
deviation
so
objectionable
and
yet
so
universally
used
for
calling
off
purposes
can
be
entirely
avoided
and
the
relay
left
directly
in
the
circuit
as
is
being
done

by

its

perhaps
regulated
some

will
be
promptly
absorbed
by
the
sides

and
cover
of
the

by

as
not

such
as
currents
of

caused
by
opening

or
by
persons
passing

during

of
an

which
would
introduce
disturbing
irregularities
can
best
be
guarded
against
by
such
spaces
as
i
have
described
filled
with
the
poorest
and
the
lightest

attainable
air
although
a
poor
and
extremely
light
is
diathermous
and
offers
no
obstruction
to
the
escape
of
radiant
heat
the
agitator
is
an
important
part
of
the
apparatus
its
object
in
this
instrument
is
twofold
it
serves
to
produce
a
uniform
temperature
throughout
the
body
of
water
in
the
instrument
and
it
answers
as
a
support
to
the
of
platinum
or
other
metal
often
intensely
hot
which
would
injure
or
destroy
the
delicate
metal
of
the
bottom
if
allowed
to
fall
on
it
for
this
second
purpose
no
spiral
revolving
agitator
such
as
that
commended
by
berthelot
would
suffice
the
best
form
is
such
as
i
have
shown
in
fig
a
concave
disk
of
made
to
conform
to
the
shape
of
the
bottom
of
the
cell
with
a
narrow
rim
turned
up
all
around
of
about
inch
thickness
is
liberally
perforated
with
holes
to
lighten
it
and
to
give
free
passage
to
water
the
concave
form
causes
the
streams
of
water
produced
by
slightly
raising
and
lowering
the
agitator
to
take
a
radial
direction
downward
or
upward
so
as
to
cross
each
other
and
promote
rapid
mixing
by
a
slight
modification
small
vanes
might
be
turned
outward
from
the
surface
of
the
metal
which
would
produce
mixing
currents
if
the
agitator
were
given
a
slight
reciprocatory
revolving
motion
thus
avoiding
the
alternate
withdrawal
and
of
any
part
of
the
stem
so
strongly
deprecated
by
berthelot
but
for
several
reasons
i
think
an
up
and
down
motion
of
the
agitator
desirable
in
this
instrument
the
platinum
heat
carrier
sometimes
at
a
temperature
of
to

thereby
brought
into
more
rapid
and
forcible
contact
with
the
water
steam
or
water
in
the
spherical
condition
is
washed
away
from
its
surface
and
by
cooling
it
more
rapidly
the
duration
of
the
observation
is
lessened
and
errors
due
to
transmission
of
heat
through
the
walls
of
the
instrument
are
diminished
the
upper
part
of
the
agitator
stem
is
of
hard
rubber
and
the
brass
portion
which
terminates
at
the
under
side
of
the
cover
when
the
agitator
is
in
its
lowest
position
suspended
by
the
shoulder
at
the
upper
end
need
never
be
lifted
for
the
purpose
of
mixing
out
of
the
hard
rubber
tube
at
the
cover
so
that
loss
of
heat
from
this
cause
must
be
very
slight
the
brass
tube
is
very
freely
perforated
with
holes
to
admit
water
streaming
radially
through
the
holes
in
the
agitator
to
contact
with
the
thermometer
the
hole
in
the
stem
at
the
top
is
flared
to
receive
a
cork
through
which
the
thermometer
is
to
be
passed
the
bulb
of
the
thermometer
should
be
elongated
and
very
slightly
smaller
in
diameter
than
the
stem
after
passing
it
through
the
cork
a
very
slight
band
a
mere
thread
of
elastic
rubber
should
be
put
around
the
bulb
near
its
lower
end
or
a
thin
narrow
shaving
of
cork
may
be
wound
around
and
tied
on
to
keep
it
from
contact
with
the
brass
tube
for
safety
and
a
little
tuft
of
wool
curled
hair
or
hard
rubber
shavings
should
be
put
in
the
bottom
of
the
brass
tube
to
avoid
accidents
for
the
same
purpose
a
light
but
sufficient
fender
of
brass
wire
say
inch
diameter
might
be
judiciously
placed
around
the
brass
tube
at
a
little
distance
to
protect
it
and
the
thermometer
inside
of
it
from
shocks
from
the
platinum
ball
when
hastily
thrown
in
as
it
must
always
be
i
have
had
delicate
and
costly
thermometers
broken
for
want
of
such
a
fender
thermometers
can
not
be
too
nice
for
this
work
for
accurate
work
at
moderate
temperatures
they
should
be
about
inches
long
having
a
safe

at
the
upper
end
with
a
range
of

a
length
of

giving
half
an

but
unless
time
can
be
given
it
is
better
to
remove
the

if
possible
let

get
thoroughly
rusted
then
scrape
off

and
rust
with
files
sharpened
to

edge
rub
down
large
surfaces
with
sandstone
and
use
no
emery
cloth
between
rivet
heads
then
wash
off
with
turpentine
this
will
give
you
a
good
solid
surface
to
work
upon
for

i

put

this

can
be

the
addition
of

pumice
to

encourages
the
boys
in
rubbing
and
prevents
the

from
clogging
by
the
time
the
last

of
the

is

the

than
a

this
can
be
rubbed
with
fine
sandpaper
or
hair
to
take
off
gloss
and
colored
the
next
morning
but
it
is
better
to
remain
hours

an
all

would
before

resemble
a

by
adding
varnish

a
very
little

to
the

the
above
are
not
exactly
thoughts
on
locomotive
painting
what
my
thoughts
are
would
require
several
dictionaries
to
express
but
that
is
owing
not
to
the
kind
of
work
but
having
to
produce
certain
results
in
a
time
that
will
not
insure
good
durable
work
for
removing
old
paint
on
wood
i
use
a
burner
from
iron
i
have
found
the
quickest
and
most
effectual
way
is
to
dissolve
as
much
sal
soda
in
warm
water
as
the
water
will
take
up
and
mix
with
fresh
lime
making
a
thick
mortar
spread
this
on
the
tank
about
an
inch
thick
with
a
trowel
when
it
begins
to
crack
which
will
be
in
a
few
minutes
it
has
softened
the
paint
enough
so
that
with
a
wide
putty
knife
you
can
take
it
all
off
then
wash
off
tank
with
water
this
takes
off
paint
rust
and
everything
including
the
skin
from
your
hands
if
you
are
not
careful
plaster
one
side
of
tank
and
use
mortar
over
again
for
the
other
side
engine
oil
used
to
brighten
smoke
stacks
no
matter
with
what
painted
will
cause

mixed
and
apply
while

with
an
occasional
rubbing

the

will
remain
bright
a
long
time
rust
always
contains
dampness
and
will
feed
on
itself
extending
underneath
and
destroying
solidly
painted
surfaces
it
is
therefore
necessary
in
order
to
secure
good
results
that
the
rust
should
be
killed
before
priming
or
that
the
priming
be
so
mixed
that
it
will
assimilate
with
the
rust
and
prevent
spreading
steel
tanks
will
not
rust
as
rapidly
as
iron
but
the
scale
is
more
apt
to
flake
off
by
the
expansion
and
contraction
of
the
metal
taking
the
paint
with
it
heated
oil
or
heated
oil
priming
will
dry
faster
and
be
more
penetrating
than
cold
i
consider
heated
boiled
oil
and
red
lead
the
best
primer
for
iron
in
regard
to
ornamentation
my
is
governed
by
the
fact
that
i
work
by
contract
and
get
no
more
for
a
highly
ornate
locomotive
than
i
do
for
a
plain
one
therefore
i
like
the
ones
and
i
hope
that
our
good
brother
burch
prophecy
that
the
days
of
locomotives
will
return
will
never
be
fulfilled
until
after
i
go
out
of
the
business
there
is
a
happy
medium
between
a
hearse
and
a
circus
wagon
and
the
locomotive
painter
when
not
tied
down
by
specifications
can
produce
a
neat
and
handsomely
painted
engine
without
the
spread
eagle
or
star
spangled
banner
my
own
ideas
are
in
the
direction
of
simple
lines
of
striping
following
the
lines
of
the
surfaces
upon
which
they
are
drawn
finally
take
all
the
time
you
can
get
the
more
the
better
and
use
accordingly
crackle
glass
an
ingenious
process
of
producing
glass
with
an
iced
or
crackled
surface
suitable
for
many
decorative
purposes
has
been
invented
in
france
by
bay
the
product
appears
in
the
form
of
sheets
or
panes
one
side
of
which
is
smooth
or
glossy
like
common
window
glass
while
the
other
is
rough
and
filled
with
innumerable
crevices
giving
it
the
frozen
or
crackled
appearance
so
much
admired
for
many
decorative
purposes
this
peculiar
cracked
surface
is
obtained
by
covering
the
surface
of
the
sheet
on
the
table
with
a
thick
coating
of
some
flux
mixed
to
form
a
paste
or
with
a
coating
of
some
more
easily
fusible
glass
and
then
subjecting
it
to
the
action
of
a
strong
fire
either
open
or
in
a
muffle
as
soon
as
the
coating
is
fused
and
the
table
is
it
is
withdrawn
and
rapidly
cooled
the
superficial
layer
of
flux
separates
itself
in
this
operation
from
the
underlying
glass
surface
and
leaves
behind
the
evidence
of
its
attachment
to
the
same
in
the
form
of
numberless
irregularities
scales
irregular
crystal
forms
giving
the
glass
surface
the
peculiar
appearance
to
which
the
above
name
has
been
given
the
rapid
cooling
of
the
glass
may
be
facilitated
with
the
aid
of
a
stream
of
cold
air
or
by
continuously
projecting
a
spray
of
cold
water
upon
it
by
protecting
certain
portions
of
the
glass
surface
from
contact
with
the
flux
with
the
use
of
a
template
of
any
ornamental
or
other
desired
form
these
portions
will
retain
their
ordinary
appearance
and
will
show
the
form
of
the
design
very
strongly
outlined
beside
the
crackled
surface
in
this
manner
letters
arabesque
and
other
patterns
in
white
or
colored
glass
can
be
produced
with
great
ease
and
with
fine
effect
how
marbles
are
made
marbles
are
named
from
the
latin
word
by
which
similar
playthings
were
known
to
the
boys
of
rome
years
ago
some
marbles
are
made
of
potter
clay
and
baked
in
an
oven
just
as
earthenware
is
baked
but
most
of
them
are
made
of
a
hard
kind
of
a
stone
found
in
saxony
germany
marbles
are
manufactured
there
in
great
numbers
and
sent
to
all
parts
of
the
world
even
to
china
for
the
use
of
the
chinese
children
the
stone
is
broken
up
with
a
hammer
into
pieces
which
are
then
ground
round
in
a
mill
the
mill
has
a
fixed
slab
of
stone
with
its
surface
full
of
little
grooves
or
furrows
above
this
a
flat
block
of
oak
wood
of
the
same
size
as
the
stone
is
made
to
turn
round
rapidly
and
while
turning
little
streams
of
water
run
in
the
grooves
and
keep
the
mill
from
getting
too
hot
about
pieces
of
the
square
pieces
of
stone
are
put
in
the
grooves
at
once
and
in
a
few
minutes
are
made
round
and
polished
by
the
wooden
block
china
and
white
marbles
are
also
used
to
make
the
round
rollers
which
have
delighted
the
hearts
of
the
boys
of
all
nations
for
hundred
of
years
marbles
thus
made
are
known
to
the
boys
as
chinas
or
alleys
real
china
ones
are
made
of
porcelain
clay
and
baked
like
chinaware
or
other
pottery
some
of
them
have
a
pearly
glaze
and
some
are
painted
in
various
colors
which
will
not
rub
off
because
they
are
baked
in
just
as
the
pictures
are
on
the
plates
and
other
tableware
glass
marbles
are
known
as
agates
they
are
made
of
both
clear
and
colored
glass
the
former
are
made
by
taking
up
a
little
melted
glass
on
the
end
of
an
iron
rod
and
making
it
round
by
dropping
it
into
a
round
mould
which
shapes
it
or
by
whirling
it
around
the
head
until
the
glass
is
made
into
a
little
ball
sometimes
the
figure
of
a
dog
or
squirrel
or
a
kitten
or
some
other
object
is
put
on
the
end
of
the
rod
and
when
it
is
dipped
into
the
melted
glass
the
glass
runs
all
around
it
and
when
the
marble
is
done
the
animal
can
be
seen
shut
up
in
it
colored
glass
marbles
are
made
by
holding
a
bunch
of
glass
rods
in
the
fire
until
they
melt
then
the
workmen
twist
them
round
into
a
ball
or
press
them
into
a
mould
so
that
when
done
the
marble
is
marked
with
bands
or
ribbons
of
color
real
agates
which
are
the
nicest
of
all
marbles
are
made
in
germany
out
of
the
stone
called
agate
the
workmen
chip
the
pieces
of
agate
nearly
round
with
hammers
and
then
grind
them
round
and
smooth
on
photography
among
the
examples
we
have
received
are
some
which
would
certainly
do
credit
to
any
professional
artist
alike
for
the
posing
lighting
and
general
treatment
indeed
we
may
say
that
some
of
the
poses
are
of
a
high
artistic
order
and
quite
a
relief
from
the
conventional
positions
and
accessories
so
frequently
seen
in
professional
work
the
expressions
secured
are
also
as
a
rule
unusually
pleasing
and
natural
this
is
no
doubt
in
a
great
measure
due
to
the
sitter
feeling
more
at
ease
in
the
amateur
friend
drawing
room
than
in
a
stranger
studio
particularly
is
this
the
case
in
some
excellent
work
pictures
sent
from
the
other
side
of
the
atlantic
and
taken
in
a
room
of
very
modest
dimensions
and
with
only
one
window
among
the
failures
if
such
they
may
be
called
the
chief
fault
lies
in
the
lighting
and
from
either
under
or
over
exposure
the
former
chiefly
arising
when
a
landscape
lens
was
used
and
the
latter
when
a
portrait
combination
was
employed
some
correspondents
also
complain
of
the
long
exposure
that
in
their
case
had
been
imperative
but
curiously
enough
with
all
the
successful
pictures
a
very
brief
exposure
has
always
been
mentioned
and
generally
with
an
exceedingly
small
window
with
a
view
to
the
further
assistance
of
those
who
have
met
with
difficulties
we
recur
again
to
the
subject
of
the
lighting
for
upon
this
must
entirely
depend
the
success
or
failure
in
producing
satisfactory
results
and
as
we
explained
in
previous
articles
unless
proper
is
secured
on
the
model
it
will
be
impossible
to
obtain
it
in
the
picture
the
chief
defect
in
this
respect
has
been
either
that
the
light
has
been
too
abrupt
and
consequently
the
high
lights
are
very
white
and
the
shadows
heavy
giving
the
pictures
an
appearance
or
the
face
is
devoid
of
shadow
one
side
being
as
light
as
the
other
hence
it
lacks
the
roundness
necessary
to
constitute
a
good
picture
in
most
instances
the
former
defect
has
arisen
from
the
reflecting
screen
not
being
properly
placed
so
as
to
reflect
back
the
light
in
the
right
direction
or
it
has
been
too
far
from
the
model
hence
it
has
lost
the
greater
part
of
its
value
it
should
be
borne
in
mind
that
the
nearer
the
sitter
is
to
the
source
of
light
the
nearer
the
reflector
must
be
to
him
and
also
that
at
whatever
angle
the
light
falls
upon
the
reflector
it
is
always
thrown
off
at
a
corresponding
one
now
supposing
that
the
light
falls
upon
the
model
at
an
angle
of
say
we
shall
have
to
place
our
reflecting
screen
at
somewhat
the
same
angle
and
the
nearer
it
is
approached
the
greater
will
be
the
effect
produced
if
the
sitter
be
placed
very
close
to
the
window
and
the
reflector
a
long
way
off
or
if
it
project
the
light
in
a
wrong
direction
it
is
manifest
that
in
the
resulting
pictures
the
shadows
will
of
necessity
be
heavy
and
the
negative
will
have
an
appearance
however
long
may
have
been
given
simply
because
there
was
no
harmony
in
the
lighting
of
the
model
in
the
case
where
the
picture
has
been
flat
it
has
arisen
from
the
sitter
being
placed
too
far
back
from
the
window
so
that
the
direct
light
falling
upon
him
has
been
too
feeble
to
produce
any
strong
lights
and
the
reflector
arranged
so
that
it
received
a
stronger
illumination
than
the
model
then
reflecting
it
on
to
the
latter
quite
overpowering
the
dominant
lights
the
remedy
for
this
is
simply
to
bring
the
sitter
more
forward
so
as
to
obtain
a
stronger
dominant
light
with
regard
to
the
time
of
exposure
we
must
again
impress
upon
the
student
the
necessity
for
placing
the
sitter
as
close
to
the
window
as
can
be
conveniently
done
for
then
he
will
receive
the
strongest
illumination
and
no
matter
how
strong
the
shadows
which
may
be
produced
they
can
always
be
modified
sufficiently
by
the
judicious
use
of
the
reflector
of
course
in
practice
there
is
a
limit
as
to
the
closeness
the
sitter
can
be
placed
inasmuch
as
if
too
near
there
will
not
be
room
enough
for
the
background
as
we
have
before
said
the
effective
light
falling
upon
the
sitter
is
governed
by
the
amount
of
direct
skylight
to
which
he
is
exposed
for
experiment
let
any
one
seat
himself
say
one
foot
from
the
window
and
sideways
to
it
and
note
the
amount
of
sky
that
can
be
seen
from
this
position
then
take
a
seat
six
feet
within
the
room
and
note
it
from
thence
the
difference
will
be
very
marked
indeed
and
it
will
fully
account
for
the
long
exposure
that
some
have
found
imperative
in
our
previous
articles
we
directed
special
attention
to
the
advantage
accruing
from
arranging
the
sitter
in
such
a
position
that
he
received
as
much
direct
light
as
possible
so
that
it
practically
helps
to
soften
the
shadows
hence
the
sitter
should
be
placed
so
that
he
is
turned
as
little
away
from
the
source
of
light
as
will
enable
the
desired
view
of
the
face
being
obtained
that
this
may
the
more
advantageously
be
done
the
camera
should
always
be
placed
as
close
as
possible
to
the
side
wall
in
which
the
window
is
situated
as
an
experiment
illustrating
the
advantage
of
this
let
a
camera
be
placed
close
to
the
wall
then
the
sitter
arranged
so
that
from
that
point
of
view
a
face
is
obtained
and
it
will
be
noticed
that
there
is
very
little
need
of
the
reflector
at
all
let
a
negative
now
be
taken
and
the
camera
brought
say
five
feet
into
the
room
and
the
sitter
without
changing
his
seat
turned
round
until
a
similar
view
of
the
face
is
obtained
from
that
point
it
will
now
be
seen
that
the
shadows
are
very
much
deeper
than
before
and
the
reflector
will
have
to
be
brought
pretty
close
in
order
to
overcome
them
nevertheless
they
may
be
obtained
quite
as
soft
and
harmonious
as
in
the
former
case
let
a
second
negative
now
be
taken
giving
the
same
exposure
as
before
and
it
will
be
found
that
if
the
first
one
were
correctly
timed
the
second
will
be
considerably
yet
the
sitter
was
at
the
same
distance
from
the
window
in
each
case
this
shows
the
advisability
of
utilizing
all
the
direct
light
it
is
possible
to
do
and
thereby
leaving
as
little
as
we
can
to
be
accomplished
by
the
reflector
when
the
sitter
is
arranged
to
the
best
advantage

a
window
of
ordinary
size
fully
exposed
pictures

generally
be
obtained

a
portrait
lens
full
opening
in
fairly
good
light
on
moderately
sensitive
plates
with
one
or
two
seconds
or
even
less
exposure

a
longer
exposure

this
be
necessary

may
fairly
be

journal
of
a
new
method
of
preparing
photographic
gelatine
emulsion
by
precipitation
of
the
bromide
of
silver
by
franz
stolze
i
consider
the
method
of
precipitation
described
below
as
far
superior
to
any
other
hitherto
employed
particularly
on
account
of
its
infallible
certainty
i
began
at
first
with
a
thirtieth
of
the
whole
quantity
of
gelatine
and
increased
that
quantity
to
a
tenth
without
the
precipitate
forming
with
greater
difficulty
the
salts
were
dissolved
in
the
usual
quantity
of
water
the
bromide
of
potassium
was
added
to
the
gelatine
and
both
solutions
cooled
in
iced
water
i
soon
found
that
even
this
was
not
necessary
i
accelerated
the
solution
of
the
salts
by
vigorous
agitation
so
that
the
temperature
became
so
much
lowered
that
even
after
the
addition
of
the
warm
gelatine
it
still
remained
low
enough
to
give
the
precipitate
when
mixed
the
mixing
took
place
gradually
all
the
usual
precautionary
measures
being
observed
such
as
pouring
the
silver
solution
into
no
in
small
quantities
at
a
time
and
constantly
stirring
and
the
separation
from
the
mother
lye
was
complete
the
formula
according
to
which
i
worked
latterly
was
as
follows
solution
nitrate
of
silver
grains
water
ounces
solution
ii
bromide
of
potassium
grains
iodide
of
potassium
grains
gelatine
grains
water
ounces
after
the
mixing
is
completed
the
perfect
separation
of
the
precipitate
takes
place
in
four
minutes
at
most
the
clear
fluid
may
be
decanted
off
almost
to
the
last
drop
after
which
the
precipitate
is
washed
three
times
with
water
in
order
to
dissolve
the
precipitate
pour
over
it
a
solution
of
part
of
bromide
of
potassium
in
parts
of
water
agitate
and
then
add
a
solution
formed
of
parts
of
ammonia
of
the
usual
strength
in
parts
of
water
the
emulsification
will
begin
at
once
without
any
further
heating
when
now
heated
on
the
water
bath
already
at
from
f
to
f
the
whole
precipitate
will
be
suspended
and
thin
films
of
the
emulsion
when
looked
through
will
have
a
grayish
tint
but
when
dry
they
will
appear
partially
red
digestion
at
f
is
continued
from
half
an
hour
to
an
hour
is
usually
long
enough
until
the
film
even
when
dry
remains
violet
through
and
through
the
remaining
gelatine
grains
dissolved
in
ounces
of
warm
water
is
then
added
filtered
and
plates
coated
with
the
resultant
emulsion
but
if
it
be
desired
to
prepare
emulsion
for
storage
wash
the
precipitate
finally
with
alcohol
and
store
it
either
under
alcohol
or
dry
it
as
usual
to
use
it
dissolve
in
the
manner
described
above
and
mix
with
gelatine
the
great
advantages
of
this
process
are
evident
not
only
is
the
troublesome
washing
saved
but
what
is
more
important
the
great
mass
of
the
gelatine
is
added
to
the
emulsion
in
a
condition
which
secures
to
the
film
a
hitherto
unattainable
firmness
also
it
enables
one
to
prepare
a
keeping
emulsion
with
a
minimum
of
alcohol
and
since
the
quantity
of
gelatine
in
the
original
emulsion
is
so
small
it
dries
when
it
is
not
desired
to
keep
it
under
alcohol
so
much
more
rapidly
and
thereby
also
furnishes
a
more
constant
preparation
i
am
convinced
that
this
process
is
as
yet
but
in
its
infancy
and
that
it
is
susceptible
of
great
improvement
from
the
purely
theoretical
standpoint
the
property
possessed
by
gelatine
of
combining
in
sufficiently
cold
solutions
with
bromide
of
silver
in
the
nascent
state
and
falling
to
the
bottom
in
a
flaky
condition
is
exceedingly
interesting
evidently
this
property
plays
a
part
in
the
preparation
of
emulsion
which
has
not
until
now
been
recognized
i
do
not
doubt
that
it
may
be
possible
to
effect
by
a
sufficiently
low
temperature
precipitation
even
from
solutions
rich
in
gelatine
if
experiments
in
that
direction
were
set
on
foot
what
influence
variations
in
temperature
may
have
upon
the
subsequent
sensitiveness
of
the
emulsion
and
whether
the
action
of
the
ammonia
and
the
bromide
of
potassium
is
more
energetic
in
the
absence
of
the
nitric
salts
are
questions
which
can
only
be
answered
after
thorough
examination
and
the
parts
played
by
the
various
additions
of
iodide
or
chloride
of
silver
in
this
method
of
emulsification
must
likewise
also
be
ascertained
by
experiment
the
object
of
this
article
is
to
point
out
this
rich
province
for
research
and
to
induce
experimenters
to
turn
their
attention
to
it
for
it
is
only
after
the
behavior
of
emulsion
under
all
these
conditions
has
been
thoroughly
examined
that
we
can
hope
to
reap
the
best
results
from
the
new
taylor
freezing
microtome
this
microtome
presents
all
the
advantages
of
any
plan
heretofore
employed
in
hardening
animal
or
vegetable
tissues
for
section
cutting
while
it
has
many
advantages
over
all
other
devices
employed
for
the
same
purpose
microscopists
who
are
interested
in
the
study
of
histology
and
pathology
have
long
felt
the
necessity
for
a
better
method
of
freezing
animal
and
vegetable
tissue
than
has
been
heretofore
at
their
command
in
hardening
tissues
by
chemical
agents
the
tissues
are
more
or
less
distorted
by
the
solutions
used
and
the
process
is
very
slow
ether
and
rhigolene
have
been
employed
with
some
degree
of
success
but
both
are
expensive
and
they
can
not
be
used
in
the
presence
of
artificial
light
because
of
danger
of
explosion
another
disadvantage
is
that
two
persons
are
required
to
attend
to
the
manipulations
one
to
force
the
vapor
into
the
freezing
box
while
the
other
uses
the
knife
the
moment
the
pumping
of
the
ether
or
rhigolene
ceases
the
tissue
operated
on
ceases
to
be
frozen
so
ephemeral
is
the
degree
of
the
cold
obtained
by
these
means
the
principal
advantages
to
be
obtained
by
the
use
of
this
microtome
are
first
great
economy
in
the
method
of
freezing
and
second
celerity
and
certainty
of
freezing
with
an
expenditure
of
cents
the
tissues
to
be
operated
on
can
be
kept
frozen

several

an
address
before
the

academy
by
dumas
of
all
the
gases
that
the

contains

is
one
which
offers
a
special
interest
as
well
on
account
of
the
part
ascribed
to
it
in
the
mutual
interchange
going
on
between
the
two
organic
kingdoms
as
on
account
of
the
relation
that
it
has
been
observed
to
occupy
between
earth
air
and
water
this
gas
is
carbonic
acid
ever
since
the
fact
has
been
established
that
animals
consume
oxygen
and
give
out
carbonic
acid
as
the
product
of
respiration
while
plants
consume
carbonic
acid
and
give
out
oxygen
the
question
has
often
been
asked
whether
the
quantity
of
carbonic
acid
contained
in
the
air
did
not
represent
a
sort
of
sustaining
reservoir
which
was
being
continually
drawn
on
by
the
plants
and
resupplied
by
animals
so
that
it
has
doubtless
remained
unchanged
owing
to
this
double
action
on
the
other
hand
boussingault
has
long
since
shown
that
volcanic
regions
give
out
through
crevices
and
fumaroles
enormous
quantities
of
carbonic
acid
the
deposition
of
carbonate
of
lime
that
is
continually
taking
place
on
the
is
on
the
other
hand
fixing
carbonic
acid
in
quantities
which
we
may
accurately
estimate
from
the
strata
of
limestone
seen
on
the
surface
of
the
earth
we
might
imagine
that
in
comparison
with
the
huge
volumes
of
carbonic
acid
sent
forth
in
volcanic
districts
even
in
the
oldest
one
and
the
mass
of
carbonate
of
lime
deposited
on
the
sea
bottom
the
results
attributed
to
the
life
of
plants
and
animals
would
be
of
no
consequence
either
for
increasing
or
diminishing
the
physiological
carbonic
acid
in
the
air
comparable
with
those
which
are
accomplished
by
the
purely
geological
exchange
schloesing
has
recently
succeeded
by
a
happy
application
of
the
principle
of
dissociation
in
showing
that
the
amount
of
carbonic
acid
in
the
air
bears
a
direct
relation
to
the
quantity
of
bicarbonate
of
lime
dissolved
in
sea
water
if
the
quantity
of
carbonic
acid
diminishes
the
bicarbonate
of
the
water
is
decomposed
half
of
its
carbonic
acid
escapes
into
the
atmosphere
and
the
neutral
carbonate
of
lime
is
precipitated
the
aqueous
vapor
condensed
from
the
air
dissolves
part
of
the
carbonic
acid
contained
therein
and
carries
it
along
when
it
falls
as
rain
upon
the
earth
and
takes
up
there
enough
lime
to
form
the
bicarbonate
which
is
thus
carried
back
to
the
sea
the
physiological
role
of
carbonic
acid
its
geognostic
influence
and
its
relations
to
most
ordinary
meteorological
phenomena
on
the
surface
all
these
contribute
to
give
special
weight
to
studies
concerned
in
the
estimation
of
the
normal
quantity
of
carbonic
acid
in
the
air
nevertheless
this
estimation
is
attended
with
great
difficulty
not
everyone
is
able
to
take
up
such
questions
and
not
all
processes
are
adapted
to
it
the
first
thought
which
would
naturally
arise
would
be
to
inclose
a
known
volume
of
air
in
a
given
vessel
and
then
determine
its
carbonic
acid
by
measuring
or
weighing
it
in
this
way
we
should
obtain
the
exact
relation
between
a
volume
of
air
and
the
volume
of
carbonic
acid
in
it
for
any
given
moment
and
in
any
given
place
if
however
this
be
done
with
a
flask
for
example
it
would
only
hold
of
carbonic
acid
weighing
milligrammes
and
whether
it
is
weighed
or
measured
the
error
may
easily
equal
per
cent
of
the
real
value
hence
no
deductions
could
be
drawn
from
the
observed
facts
for
this
reason
larger
volumes
of
air
were
taken
and
a
current
of
air
whose
volume
could
be
accurately
measured
by
known
methods
was
passed
through
condensers
capable
of
retaining
the
carbonic
acid
but
in
this
case
the
air
must
pass
very
slowly
through
it
so
that
the
process
may
last
several
hours
and
since
the
air
is
continually
in
motion
owing
to
vertical
and
horizontal
currents
the
experiment
may
be
begun
with
the
air
of
one
place
and
concluded
with
air
from
a
far
distant
spot
for
example
if
an
experiment
lasting
hours
was
made
in
paris
when
the
air
moved
but
four
meters
per
second
nine
or
ten
miles
per
hour
it
might
be
begun
with
air
from
the
department
of
the
seine
and
end
with
air
from
the
department
of
the
rhone
or
the
belgian
frontier
according
to
the
direction
of
the
wind
so
long
as
we
had
no
analytical
methods
of
sufficient
delicacy
to
estimate
with
certainty
the
hundredth
or
at
least
the
tenth
of
a
milligramme
of
carbonic
acid
it
was
very
difficult
to
determine
the
quantity
in
the
air
at
a
given
time
and
place
it
is
frequently
possible
to
analyze
upon
the
plain
air
that
has
descended
from
the
heights
above
and
to
examine
by
bright
daylight
the
effect
of
night
upon
the
atmosphere
still
other
difficulties
show
themselves
in
such
investigations
it
seems
very
easy
to
collect
carbonic
acid
in
potash
tubes
and
to
determine
its
amount
from
the
increase
in
weight
of
the
tubes
but
alas
to
how
many
sources
of
error
is
this
method
exposed
if
the
potash
has
been
in
contact
with
any
organic
substance
it
will
absorb
oxygen
if
the
pumice
that
takes
the
place
of
the
potash
contains
protoxide
of
iron
it
will
also
absorb
oxygen
in
both
cases
the
oxygen
increases
the
weight
of
the
carbonic
acid
every
experimenter
who
has
been
compelled
to
repeat
the
weighing
of
a
somewhat
complicate
piece
of
apparatus
with
an
interval
of
several
hours
between

how
many
inaccuracies
he
is
exposed
to
if
he
is
compelled
to
take
into
calculation
the
changes
of
temperature
and
pressure
and
the
moisture
on
the
surface
of
the
apparatus
after
fighting
all
these
difficulties
and
frequently
in
vain
the
experimenter
begins
to
mistrust
every
result
that
depends
only
on
difference
in
weight
and
to
prefer
those
methods
whereby
the
substance
to
be
estimated
can
be
isolated
so
that
it
can
be
seen
and
handled
weighed
or
measured
in
a
free
state
and
in
its
own
natural
condition
the
classical
experiments
of
thenard
of
th
de
saussure
of
boussingault
on
the
quantity
of
carbonic
acid
in
the
air
are
well
known

every

be
organized

and

reiset
who
has
conducted
a
long
and
tedious
series
of
experiments
on
this
subject
has
adopted
a
process
that
seems
to
offer
every
guarantee
of
accuracy
the
air
that
furnishes
the
carbonic
acid
is
aspirated
through
the
absorption
apparatus
by
two
aspirators
of
liters
capacity
the
temperature
and
pressure
of
the
air
are
carefully
measured
the
carbonic
acid
is
absorbed
by
baryta
water
in
three
bulb
apparatus
the
last
bulb
which
serves
as
a
check
to
control
the
operation
remains
clear
and
proves
that
no
binoxide
of
barium
is
formed
the
baryta
water
used
is
titrated
before
and
after
the
operation
and
from
the
difference
is
calculated
the
quantity
of
carbonate
formed
and
hence
of
the
carbonic
acid
these
tedious
experiments
which
varied
in
duration
from
to
hours
require
at
least
two
days
of
continuous
labor
they
were
repeated
times
by
reiset
in
and
they
were
made
in
still
weather
and
in
violent
winds
and
storms
the
air
was
taken
at
the
in
the
middle
of
the
fields
on
the
level
earth
during
harvests
in
the
forests
and
in
paris
under
such
varied
conditions
the
quantity
of
carbonic
acid
varied
but
little
the
numbers
obtained
were
between
and
which
may
be
taken
as
a
general
average
of
the
carbonic
acid
in
the
air
the
quantity
of
carbonic
acid
in
the
free
atmosphere
is
tolerably
constant
which
must
necessarily
be
the
case
according
to
proposed
relation
between
the
of
lime
in
the
sea
and
the
carbonic
acid
in
the
air
the
only
cause
that
seems
at
all
competent
to
change
the
geological
quantity
of
carbonic
acid
in
the
atmosphere
is
the
formation
of
fog
as
the
aqueous
vapors
condense
they
collect
the
carbonic
acid
and
the
foggy
air
as
a
rule
is
more
heavily
laden
with
this
gas
than
ordinary
air
it
is
not
surprising
that
there
is
less
carbonic
acid
in
the
air
collected
on
clear
summer
days
in
the
midst
of
clover
that
is
in
an
active
reducing
furnace
if
anything
is
surprising
it
is
that
the
quantity
of
carbonic
acid
does
not
sink
below
it
is
also
a
matter
for
surprise
that
in
paris
among
so
many
sources
of
carbonic
acid
the
furnace
fires
the
respiration
of
men
and
animals
and
the
spontaneous
decomposition
and
decay
of
organic
substances
the
quantity
of
carbonic
acid
does
not
exceed
if
then
the
great
general
mean
of
normal
atmospheric
carbonic
acid
deviates
but
little
from
or
it
is
not
doubtful
that
under
local
conditions
in
closed
places
and
under
exceptional
meteorological
conditions
considerable
variations
may
occur
in
these
proportions
but
these
variations
do
not
affect
the
general
laws
of
the
composition
of
the
atmosphere
there
are
two
entirely
distinct
points
from
which
the
measurement
of
the
atmospheric
carbonic
acid
may
be
contemplated
the
first
consists
in
considering
it
as
a
geological
element
which
belongs
to
the
gaseous
envelope
of
the
earth
in
general
and
it
leads
us
to
express
the
general
relation
of
carbonic
acid
to
the
quantity
of
air
as
about
three
volumes
in
the
second
which
relates
to
accidental
and
local
phenomena
to
the
activity
of
man
and
beast
to
the
effect
of
fires
and
of
decomposing
organic
matter
to
volcanic
emanations
and
finally
to
the
action
of
clouds
and
rain
permits
us
to
recognize
the
changes
which
can
occur
in
air
exposed
to
the
influences
mentioned
and
to
a
certain
extent
confined
without
denying
that
it
is
of
interest
from
a
meteorological
and
hygienic
standpoint
it
does
not
take
the
same
rank
as
first
reiset
experiments
by
their
number
accuracy
the
large
volumes
employed
and
the
interval
of
years
that
separate
them
have
definitely
established
two
facts
on
which
the
earth
history
must
depend
the
first
is
that
the
percentage
of
carbonic
acid
in
the
air
scarcely
changes
the
second
that
it
differs
but
little
from
three
by
volume
these
results
are
fully
confirmed
by
the
results
which
were
obtained
by
franz
schulze
in
rostock
in
and
the
averages
which
he
got
with
very
small
variation
were
for
for
and
for
more
recently
muentz
and
aubin
have
analyzed
air
collected
on
the
plains
near
paris
on
the
pic
du
midi
and
on
the
top
of
their
results
agree
with
those
published
by
reiset
and
schulze
the
grand
average
of
carbonic
oxide
in
the
air
seems
to
be
tolerably
fixed
but
after
this
is
established
it
remains
to
study
the
variations
that
it
is
capable
of
not
from
local
causes
which
are
of
little
importance
but
from
general
causes
connected
with
large
movements
of
the
air
upon
this
study
which
demands
the
of
a
definite
number
of
observers
stationed
at
different
and
distant
points
of
the
earth
the
experiments
being
made
simultaneously
and
by
comparable
methods
dumas
called
the
attention
of
the
academy
to
this
point
in
connection
with
its
mission
of
selecting
suitable
stations
for
observing
the
transit
of
venus
the
process
and
apparatus
of
muentz
and
aubin
offer
the
means
adapted
for
making
these
experiments
and
seem
sufficient
to
solve
the
problem
which
science
proposes
of
determining
the
present
quantity
of
carbonic
acid
in
the
air
if
these
experiments
yield
satisfactory
results
as
we
have
good
reasons
to
believe
they
will
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
annual
observations
will
be
made
in
places
so
as
to
determine
the
variations
which
may
possibly
take
place
in
the
relative
quantity
of
atmospheric
carbonic
acid
during
the
coming
although
this
proposition
was
made
by
a
frenchman
to
his
fellow
scientists
would
it
not
be
well
for
some
american
to
accept
the
challenge
and
bring
it
before
the
coming
meeting
of
the
american
association
for
the
advancement
of
science
in
the
hope
that
we
too
may
contribute
our

of

of
carbonic
oxide
and
oxygen
was
submitted
to
electric
sparks
without
exploding
it
was
further
shown
that
the
introduction
of
a
very
minute
quantity
of
aqueous
vapor
into
the
mixture
was
sufficient
to
cause
explosive
combination
between
the
gases
when
the
spark
was
passed
the
hypothesis
advanced
to
account
for
the
observed
facts
was
that
carbonic
oxide
does
not
unite
directly
with
oxygen
at
a
high
temperature
but
only
indirectly
through
the
intervention
of
present
a
molecule
of
water
being
decomposed
by
one
of
carbonic
oxide
to
form
a
molecule
of
carbonic
acid
and
one
of
free
hydrogen
and
the
latter
uniting
with
the
oxygen
to
a
molecule
of
water
which
again
undergoes
the
same
cycle
of
changes
till
all
the
oxygen
is
transferred
to
the
carbonic
oxide
o
co
o
o
footnote
report
of
british
association
p
for
such
a
series
of
reactions
a
few
molecules
of
water
would
suffice
and
the
change
produced
by
their
alternate
reduction
and
oxidation
would
come
under
the
old
term
of
catalytic
action
inasmuch
as
the
few
water
molecules
present
at
the
beginning
are
found
in
the
same
state
at
the
completion
of
the
reaction
the
truth
of
this
hypothesis
has
since
been
confirmed
by
experiments
i
have
made
on
the
incomplete
combustion
of
mixtures
of
carbonic
oxide
and
hydrogen
and
on
the
velocity
of
explosion
of
carbonic
oxide
and
oxygen
with
varying
proportions
of
aqueous
vapor
i
therefore
thought
a
description
of
the
more
convenient
methods
lately
devised
as
lecture
experiments
for
showing
the
influence
of
water
on
the
combustion
of
carbonic
oxide
would
not
be
uninteresting
to
the
section
a
glass
tube
from
inches
to
feet
long
closed
at
one
end
and
provided
with
platinum
wires
is
bent
near
its
open
end
so
that
the
shorter
arm
makes
an
angle
of
about
with
the
longer
arm
the
tube
held
by
a
clamp
is
heated
in
a
bunsen
flame
and
is
then
filled
with
mercury
heated
to
about
the
mixture
of
gases
is
then
made
to
displace
a
portion
of
the
mercury
by
forcing
it
through
a
fine
tube
which
is
connected
by
a
steel
cap
to
the
eudiometer
of
mcleod
gas
apparatus
and
passes
down
through
the
mercury
in
the
shorter
arm
of
the
experimental
tube
when
a
sufficient
quantity
of
the
gaseous
mixture
has
been
collected
in
the
longer

some
dry
phosphoric
oxide
is
introduced
in
the
following
way
a
small
glass
tube
is
heated
packed
with
the
dry
powder
and
pushed
down
into
the
shorter
arm
of
the
experimental
tube
with
a
hot
glass
rod
the
phosphoric
oxide
is
pushed
out
at
the
bottom
of
the
small
tube
and
passes
up
into
the
gaseous
mixture
in
the
longer
arm
after
standing
for
a
few
hours
in
contact
with
the
phosphoric
oxide
the
gases
may
be
submitted
to
strong
sparks
from
a
leyden
jar
without
igniting
care
must
be
taken
that
none
of
the
oxide
comes
in
contact
with
the
platinum
wires
for
if
any
sticks
to
the
wires
it
becomes
heated
by
the
passage
of
the
sparks
and
gives
off
enough
water
to
determine
the
explosion
in
this
way
i
have
prepared
several
specimens
of
a
mixture
of
carbonic
oxide
and
oxygen
in
the
proper
proportions
to
form
carbonic
acid
some
of
these
tubes
have
been
submitted
without
explosion
to
sparks
from
a
large
leyden
jar
to
a
continuous
succession
of
sparks
from
a
holtz
machine
and
to
the
discharge
of
a
ruhmkorff
coil
that
heated
the
platinum
wires
between
which
it
passed
to
bright
redness

withstood
the
passage
of
the

discharge
of

exploded
after
a
few
seconds
when
the
platinum
wires
became
this
i
think
may
probably
be
attributed
to
hydrogen
occluded
by
the
platinum

given
off
on
heating
and
forming

the

composition
of

at
the
present
time
english
brewers
are
being
denounced
for
substituting
maize
rice
and
other
raw
grain
for
barley
malt
and
the
beers
produced
partly
from
such
materials
are
described
as
being
very
inferior
and
even
injurious
to
health
that
such
denunciations
are
altogether
unwarranted
is
evident
to
all
who
have
paid
any
attention
to
the
subject
and
are
acquainted
with
the
chemical
changes
involved
in
brewing
and
with
the
composition
of
the
resulting
beers
unfortunately
but
few
comparative
analyses
have
been
published
of
beers
made
solely
from
malt
and
beers
made
from
malt
in
conjunction
with
raw
grain
and
therefore
such
wild
assertions
as
were
recently
uttered
in
the
house
of
commons
have
remained
unanswered
a
german
chemist
hanamann
some
time
since
made
a
series
of
analyses
of
beers
brewed
partly
from
raw
grain
and
his
results
completely
controvert
the
theory
that
raw
grain
beers
essentially
differ
in
composition
from
malt
beers
four
worts
were
made
by
the
decoction
system
of
mashing
a
entirely
from
barley
malt
b
from
per
cent
of
malt
and
per
cent
of
maize
c
from
per
cent
of
malt
and
per
cent
of
rice
and
d
from
per
cent
of
malt
and
per
cent
of
pure
starch
the
analyses
of
these
respective
worts
gave
the
following
results
a
b
c
d
sugar
dextrine
total
extract
albuminoids
other
substances
it
will
be
seen
that
these
worts
vary
very
little
in
composition
the
chief
points
of
difference
being
that
those
made
partly
from
raw
grain
are
more
dextrinous
and
contain
less
albuminoids
than
the
wort
made
from
malt
alone
the
process
of
brewing
was
then
continued
as
usual
and
after
fermentation
the
resulting
beers
were
again
analyzed
with
the
following
results
a
b
c
d
alcohol
sugar
dextrine
extract
albuminoids
other
substances
it
will
be
observed
that
the
beers
made
partly
from
raw
grain
are
slightly
more
alcoholic
but
in
other
respects
differ
but
very
little
from
the
pure
malt
beer
but
none
of
them
can
in
any
way
be
pronounced
as
really
inferior
or
unwholesome
the
beer
made
partly
from
maize
is
in
fact
hardly
to
be
distinguished
in
chemical
composition
from
that
made
solely
from
malt
these
worts
and
beers
were
brewed
upon
the
german
system
but
analogous
results
would
undoubtedly
be
obtained
with
beers
brewed
from
the
like
materials
on
the
english
system
we
hope
soon
to
be
in
a
position
to
publish
some
comparative
analyses
of
beers
brewed
in
this
country
from
malt
combined
with
different
kinds
of
raw
grain
but
the
analyses
which
we
have
now
quoted
constitute
a
sufficient
refutation
to
those
who
assert
that
brewers
using
raw
grain
are
producing
an
injurious
or
even
an
inferior
quality
of
double

is
not
an
uncommon
plant
in
greenhouses
in
which
it
is
generally
known
under
the
garden
name
of
it
is
however
perfectly
hardy
and
it
is
with
the
view
of
making
that
fact
known
that
we
produce
the
annexed
illustration
of
it
which
represents
a
spray
lately
sent
to
us
by
veitch
from
their
nursery
at
coombe
wood
where
the
plant
has
withstood
the
full
rigor
of
our
climate
for
some
years
past
the
coombe
wood
nursery
is
not
very
well
sheltered
and
the
soil
is
not
of
the
lightest
description
the
plant
may
therefore
be
said
to
have
a
fair
trial
we
have
also
met
with
it
in
the
open
air
in
other
places
besides
coombe
wood
and
if
we
remember
rightly
wilson
has
a
fine
old
bush
of
it
on
his
rockery
which
abounds
with
shrubs
of
a
similar
character
all
apparently
at
home
this
shrub
is
of
low
growth
somewhat
bushy
in
habit
and
rather
sparsely
furnished
with
oval
leaves
of
a
leathery
texture
it
produces
its
flowers
in
early

when
a
bush
well
covered
with
clusters
of

do
well
to
try
it
in

so
much
the

is
called
also

have
no

some
of

can
enlighten
us
on

miller
says
that
he
made
experiments
with
the
juice
for
coloring
flowers
and
succeeded
extremely
well
thus
making
the
tuberose
and
the
double
white
narcissus
variegated
in
one
night
of
this
species
there
is
a
variety
with
yellow
berries
which
are
not
quite
so
handsome
as
the
red
though
very
attractive
differs
from
lævis
in
having
hairy
leaves
those
of
lævis
being
quite
smooth
it
also
differs
in
the
duller
red
color
of
the
berries
lævis
being
much
the
prettier
both
are
natives
of
the
west
in
the
apples
in
store
apples
always
whether
in
barrels
or
piles
when
the
temperature
is
rising
so
that
the
surrounding
air
is
warmer
than
the
apples
condense
moisture
on
the
surface
and
become
quite
moist
and
sometimes
dripping
wet
and
this
has
given
the
common
impression
that
they
sweat
which
is
not
true
as
they
come
from
the
tree
they
are
plump
and
solid
full
of
juice
by
keeping
they
gradually
part
with
a
portion
of
this
moisture
the
quantity
varying
with
the
temperature
and
the
circulation
of
air
about
them
and
being
much
more
rapid
when
first
picked
than
after
a
short
time
and
by
parting
with
this
moisture
they
become
springy
or
yielding
and
in
a
better
condition
to
pack
closely
in
barrels
but
this
moisture
never
shows
on
the
surface
in
the
form
of
sweat
in
keeping
apples
very
much
depends
upon
the
surroundings
every
variation
in
temperature
causes
a
change
in
the
fruit
and
hastens
maturity
and
decay
and
we
should
strive
to
have
as
little
change
as
possible
and
also
have
the
temperature
as
low
as
possible
so
the
apples
do
not
freeze
then
some
varieties
keep
much
better
in
open
bins
than
others
for
instance
the
greening
is
one
of
the
best
to
store
in
bins
a
very
good
way
for
storing
apples
is
to
have
a
that
can
be
made
and
kept
at
from
to
and
the
air
close
and
pure
put
the
apples
in
slatted
boxes
not
bins
each
box
holding
about
one
barrel
and
pile
them
in
tiers
so
that
one
box
above
rests
on
two
below
and
only
barrel
when
ready
to
market
but
this
is
an
expensive
way
and
can
only
be
practiced
by
those
with
limited
crops
of
apples
and
it
is
not
at
all
practicable
for
long
keeping
because
in
this
way
they
lose
moisture
much
more
rapidly
than
when
headed
close
in
barrels
and
become
badly
shriveled
all
things
considered
there
is
no
way
of
keeping
apples
quite
so
good
and
practicable
as
packing
in
light
barrels
and
storing
in
cool
cellars
the
barrel
forms
a
room
within
a
room
and
prevents
circulation
of
air
and
consequent
drying
and
shrinking
of
the
fruit
and
also
lessens
the
changes
of
temperature
and
besides
more
fruit
can
be
packed
and
stored
in
a
given
space
than
in
any
other
way
the
poorest
of
all
ways
is
the
large
open
bin
and
the
objections
are
too
much
fruit
in
contact
too
much
weight
upon
the
lower
fruit
and
too
much
trouble
to
handle
and
sort
when
desirable
to
market
it
was
formerly
the
almost
universal
custom
in
western
new
york
to
sort
and
barrel
the
apples
as
fast
as
picked
from
the
trees
heading
up
at
once
and
drawing
to
market
or
piling
in
some
cool
place
till
the
approach
of
cold
weather
and
then
putting
in
cellars
by
this
method
it
was
impossible
to
prevent
leaves
twigs
and
other
dirt
from
getting
into
the
bin
and
it
was
difficult
to
properly
sort
the
fruit
and
if
well
sorted
occasionally
an
apple
with
no
visible
cause
will
entirely
and
wholly
rot
soon
after
packing
some
varieties
are
more
liable
to
do
this
than
others
but
all
will
to
some
extent
this
occurs
within
a
week
or
ten
days
after
picking
and
when
barreled
these
decayed
apples
are
of
course
in
the
barrels
and
help
to
decay
others
although
packed
ever
so
well
and
pressed
ever
so
tight
the
shrinking
of
the
fruit
soon
makes
them
loose
and
nothing
is
so
bad
in
handling
apples
as
this
altogether
this
was
a
very
untidy
method
of
handling
apples
and
has
been
entirely
abandoned
for
a
better
the
very
best
method
depends
a
good
deal
upon
the
quantity
to
be
handled
if
only
a
few
hundred
barrels
they
can
be
put
in
open
barrels
and
stored
on
the
barn
floor
place
empty
barrels
on
a
or
old
sled
take
out
the
upper
head
and
place
it
in
the
bottom
of
the
barrel
on
picking
the
apples
put
them
without
sorting
directly
into
these
barrels
and
when
a
load
is
filled
draw
to
the
barn
and
place
in
tiers
on
end
along
one
side
of
the
floor
when
one
tier
is
full
lay
some
strips
of
boards
on
top
and
on
these
place
another
tier
of
barrels
then
more
boards
and
another
tier
two
men
can
easily
place
them
three
tiers
high
and
an
ordinary
barn
floor
will
in
this
way
store
a
good
many
barrels
of
apples
where
many
hundreds
or
thousands
of
barrels
are
grown
it
is
a
good
plan
to
build
houses
or
sheds
in
convenient
places
in
the
orchard
for
holding
the
apples
as
picked
these
are
built
on
posts
or
stones
about
one
foot
from
the
ground
floors
sides
and
ends
should
be
made
of
strips
about
four
inches
wide
and
placed
one
inch
apart
and
the
roof
should
project
well
on
every
side
the
apples
as
picked
are
drawn
to
these
in
boxes
or
barrels
and
piled
carefully
on
the
floors
about
three
feet
deep
where
these
houses
are
not
provided
the
next
best
way
is
to
pile
the
apples
as
picked
on
clean
straw
under
the
trees
in
the
deepest
shade
to
be
found
after
lying
in
any
one
of
these
positions
about
ten
days
they
should
be
carefully
sorted
and
packed
in
clean
barrels
placing
at
least
two
layers
on
the
bottom
of
the
barrels
with
stems
down
after
this
fill
full
shaking
moderately
two
or
three
times
as
the
tilling
goes
on
and
with
some
sort
of
press
press
the
head
down
so
that
the
apples
shall
remain
firm
and
full
under
all
kinds
of
handling
apples
may
be
pressed
too
much
as
well
as
too
little
if
pressed
so
that
many
are
broken
and
badly
broken
they
will
soon
get
loose
and
rattle
in
the
barrels
and
nothing
spoils
them
sooner
than
this
what
we
want
is
to
have
them
just
so
they
shall
be
sure
to
remain
firm
and
carefully
shaking
so
as
to
have
them
well
settled
together
has
as
much
to
do
with
their
remaining
firm
as
the
pressing
down
of
the
head
after
the
barrels
are
filled
and
headed
they
should
at
once
be
placed
on
their
sides
in
a
barn
or
shed
or
in
piles
covered
with
boards
from
sun
and
rain
or
if
a
or
cellar
is
handy
they
may
at
once
be
placed
therein
the
object
should
be
to
keep
them
as
cool
and
at
as
even
a
temperature
as
possible
in
all
the
operations
of
handling
apples
from
picking
to
market
remember
that
carelessness
and
harshness
always
bruise
the
fruit
and
that
every
bruise
detracts
much
from
its
keeping
and
market
value
and
remember
another
thing
that
honesty
is
the
best
woodward
in
on
determining
the
sun
distance
by
a
new
method
by
eytinge
cainsville
canada
it
is
well
known
that
the
sun
distance
has
been
determined
from
the
velocity
of
light
it
has
been
found
by
terrrestrial
experiments
about
how
fast
light
travels
and
knowing
from
certain
astronomical
phenomena
the
time
light
requires
to
pass
from
the
sun
to
the
earth
we
have
been
able
to
determine
the
sun
distance
there
are
several
methods
of
determining
the
velocity
of
light
but
hitherto
only
two
plans
have
been
used
to
detect
the
time
light
occupies
in
passing
from
the
sun
to
the
earth
this
time
was
first
discovered
by
observations
of
the
satellites
of
jupiter
it
was
found
that
the
interval
between
the
eclipses
of
these
bodies
was
not
always
the
same
that
the
eclipses
occurred
earlier
when
jupiter
was
nearest
the
earth
and
later
when
he
was
at
his
greatest
distance
roemer
a
danish
astronomer
first
detected
the
cause
of
this
variation
the
second
method
by
which
this
time
has
been
found
is
the
aberration
of
stellar
light
this
refined
method
was
detected
by
the
great
english
astronomer
bradley
about
two
years
ago
it
occurred
to
me
that
a
third
method
can
be
used
to
solve
this
important
problem
my
plan
is
this
it
is
well
known
that
many
variable
stars
such
as
algol
sigma
librae
u
coronae
and
the
remarkable
variable
discovered
by
sawyer
fluctuate
at
regular
intervals
now
i
believe
it
is
possible
to
determine
very
accurately
the
intervals
between
these
changes
and
by
noting
the
change
of
time
in
these
intervals
when
the
earth
is
in
different
points
of
its
orbit
we
get
the
time
light
requires
to
cross
that
orbit
for
as
in
the
case
of
the
satellites
of
jupiter
when
the
star
is
in
opposition
the
changes
will
occur
earlier
than
when
it
is
in
conjunction
or
approaching
that
point
i
have
recently
put
this
plan
to
the
test
and
hope
before
long
to
make
known
the
results
in
detecting
the
changes
of
variables
i
have
attempted
to
substitute
in
place
of
the
ordinary
eye
observations
a
very
delicate
thermopile
which
registers
the
changes
in
the
star
heat
so
far
as
i
know
this
is
the
first
application
of
the
thermopile
to
variables
professor
haeckel
on
darwin
in
appears
a
report
of
the
remarkable
address
given
by
professor
haeckel
at
the
recent
eisenach
meeting
of
the
german
association
of
naturalists
on
the
theories
of
darwin
goethe
and
lamarck
the
address
is
mainly
devoted
to
darwin
and
darwinism
and
of
both
we
need
scarcely
say
professor
haeckel
has
the
highest
estimate
he
said
when
five
months
ago
the
sad
intelligence
reached
us
by
telegraph
from
england
that
on
april
charles
darwin
had
concluded
his
life
of
rich
activity
there
thrilled
with
rare
unanimity
through
the
whole
scientific
world
the
feeling
of
an
irreparable
loss
not
only
did
the
innumerable
adherents
and
scholars
of
the
great
naturalist
lament
the
decease
of
the
head
master
who
had
guided
them
but
even
the
most
esteemed
of
his
opponents
had
to
confess
that
one
of
the
most
significant
and
influential
spirits
of
the
century
had
departed
this
universal
sentiment
found
its
most
eloquent
expression
in
the
fact
that
immediately
after
his
death
the
english
newspapers
of
all
parties
and
his
conservative
opponents
demanded
that
the
of
the
deceased
should
be
in
the
valhalla
of
great
britain
the
national
temple
of
fame
westminster
abbey
and
there
in
point
of
fact
he
found
his
last
by
the
side
of
the
newton
in
no
country
of
the
world
however
england
not
excepted
has
the
reforming
doctrine
of
darwin
met
with
so
much
living
interest
or
evoked
such
a
storm
of
writings
for
and
against
as
in
germany
it
is
therefore
only
a
debt
of
honor
we
pay
if
at
this
year
assembly
of
german
naturalists
and
physicians
we
gratefully
call
to
remembrance
the
mighty
genius
who
has
departed
and
bring
home
to
our
minds
the
loftiness
of
the
theory
of
nature
to
which
he
has
elevated
us
and
what
place
in
the
world
could
be
more
appropriate
for
rendering
this
service
of
thanks
than
eisenach
with
its
wartburg
this
stronghold
of
free
inquiry
and
free
opinion
as
in
this
sacred
spot
years
ago
martin
luther
by
his
reform
of
the
church
in
its
head
and
members
introduced
a
new
era
in
the
history
of
civilization
so
in
our
days
has
charles
darwin
by
his
reform
of
the
doctrine
of
development
constrained
the
whole
perception
thought
and
volition
of
mankind
into
new
and
higher
courses
it
is
true
that
personally
both
in
his
character
and
influence
darwin
has
more
affinity
to
the
meek
and
mild
melanchthon
than
to
the
powerful
and
inspired
luther
in
the
scope
and
importance
however
of
their
great
work
of
reformation
the
two
cases
were
entirely
parallel
and
in
both
the
success
marks
a
new
epoch
in
the
development
of
the
human
mind
consider
first
the
irrefragable
fact
of
the
unexampled
success
which
darwin
reform
of
science
has
achieved
in
the
short
space
of
years
for
never
before
since
the
beginning
of
human
science
has
any
new
theory
penetrated
so
deeply
to
the
foundation
of
the
whole
domain
of
knowledge
or
so
deeply
affected
the
most
cherished
personal
convictions
of
individual
students
never
before
has
a
new
theory
called
forth
such
vehement
opposition
and
so
completely
overcome
it
in
such
short
time
the
depicture
of
the
astounding
revolution
which
darwin
has
accomplished
in
the
minds
of
men
in
their
entire
view
of
nature
and
conception
of
the
world
will
form
an
interesting
chapter
in
the
future
history
of
the
doctrine
of
development
describing
a
visit
which
he
paid
to
the
late
darwin
in
professor
haeckel
says
in
darwin
own
carriage
which
he
had
thoughtfully
sent
for
my
convenience
to
the
railway
station
i
drove
one
sunny
morning
in
october
through
the
graceful
hilly
landscape
of
kent
which
with
the
checkered
foliage
of
its
woods
with
its
stretches
of
purple
heath
yellow
broom
and
evergreen
oaks
was
arrayed
in
the
fairest
autumnal
dress
as
the
carriage
drew
up
in
front
of
darwin
pleasant
clad
in
a
vesture
of
ivy
and
embowered
in
elms
there
stepped
out
to
meet
me
from
the
shady
porch
overgrown
with
creeping
plants
the
great
naturalist
himself
a
tall
and
venerable
figure
with
the
broad
shoulders
of
an
atlas
supporting
a
world
of
thoughts
his
forehead
highly
and
broadly
arched
as
in
the
case
of
goethe
and
deeply
furrowed
by
the
plow
of
mental
labor
his
kindly
mild
eyes
looking
forth
under
the
shadow
of
prominent
brows
his
amiable
mouth
surrounded
by
a
copious
beard
the
cordial
prepossessing
expression
of
the
whole
face
the
gentle
mild
voice
the
slow
deliberate
utterance
the
natural
and
train
of
ideas
which
marked
his
conversation
captivated
my
whole
heart
in
the
first
hour
of
our
meeting
just
as
his
great
work
had
formerly
on
my
first
reading
it
taken
my
whole
understanding
by
storm
i
fancied
a
lofty
world
sage
out
of
hellenic
antiquity
a
socrates
or
aristotle
stood
alive
before
me
our
conversation
of
course
turned
principally
on
the
subject
which
lay
nearest
the
hearts
of
both
on
the
progress
and
prospects
of
the
history
of
development
those
prospects
at
that
time
years
ago
were
bad
enough
for
the
highest
authorities
had
for
the
most
part
set
themselves
against
the
new
doctrines
with
touching
modesty
darwin
said
that
his
whole
work
was
but
a
weak
attempt
to
explain
in
a
natural
way
the
origin
of
animal
and
vegetable
species
and
that
he
should
not
live
to
see
any
noteworthy
success
following
the
experiment
the
mountain
of
opposing
prejudice
being
so
high
he
thought
i
had
greatly
overestimated
his
small
merit
and
that
the
high
praise
i
had
bestowed
on
it
in
my
morphology
was
far
too
exaggerated
we
next
came
to
speak
of
the
numerous
and
violent
attacks
on
his
work
which
were
then
in
the
ascendant
in
the
case
of
many
of
those
pitiful
botches
one
was
in
fact
quite
at
a
loss
whether
more
to
lament
the
want
of
understanding
and
judgment
they
showed
or
to
give
the
greater
vent
to
the
indignation
one
could
not
but
feel
at
the
arrogance
and
presumption
of
those
miserable
scribblers
who
ideas
and
bespattered
his
character
i
had
then
as
on
later
occasions
repeatedly
expressed
my
just
scorn
of
the
contemptible
clan
darwin
smiled
at
this
and
endeavored
to
calm
me
with
the
words
dear
young
friend
believe
me
one
must
have
compassion
and
forbearance
with
such
poor
creatures
the
stream
of
truth
they
can
only
hold
back
for
a
passing
instant
but
never
permanently
stem
in
my
later
visits
to
down
in
and
i
had
the
pleasure
of
being
able
to
relate
to
darwin
the
mighty
progress
which
in
the
past
intervals
his
doctrines
had
made
in
germany
their
decisive
outburst
happened
more
rapidly
and
more
completely
here
with
us
than
in
england
for
the
reason
chiefly
that
the
power
of
social
and
religious
prejudice
is
not
nearly
so
strong
here
as
among
our
cousins
across
the
channel
who
are
better
placed
than
ourselves
darwin
was
perfectly
well
aware
of
all
this
though
his
knowledge
of
our
language
and
literature
was
defective
as
he
often
complained
yet
he

appreciation
