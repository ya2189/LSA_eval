to
the
queen
majesty
most
gracious
acceptance
of
the
dedication
of
my
book
on
needlework
as
art
casts
a
light
upon
the
subject
that
shows
its
worthiness
and
my
inability
to
do
it
justice
still
i
hope
i
may
fill
a
gap
in
the
artistic
literature
of
our
day
and
i
venture
to
lay
my
work
at
your
majesty
feet
with
loyal
marian
alford
preface
in
the
preface
to
the
handbook
of
art
needlework
which
i
edited
for
the
royal
school
at
south
kensington
in
i
undertook
to
write
a
second
part
to
be
devoted
to
design
colour
and
the
modes
of
treating
decorative
art
as
applied
especially
to
embroidered
hangings
furniture
dress
and
the
smaller
objects
of
luxury
circumstances
have
since
then
obliged
me
to
reconsider
this
intention
and
i
have
found
it
more
practicable
to
cast
the
information
which
i
have
collected
from
eastern
and
western
sources
into
the
form
of
a
separate
work
which
in
no
way
supersedes
or
interferes
with
the
technical
instruction
supposed
to
be
conveyed
in
a
handbook
i
have
found
so
much
amusement
in
learning
for
myself
the
history
of
the
art
of
embroidery
and
in
tracing
the
beginnings
and
the
interchanges
of
national
schools
that
i
can
not
but
hope
that
i
may
excite
a
similar
interest
in
some
of
my
readers
and
so
induce
those
who
are
capable
to
help
and
lift
it
to
a
higher
place
than
it
has
been
allowed
in
these
latter
days
to
occupy
if
i
have
given
too
important
a
position
to
the
art
of
needlework
i
would
observe
that
while
i
have
been
writing
decorative
embroidery
has
come
to
the
front
and
is
at
this
moment
one
of
the
hobbies
of
the
day
and
i
would
point
out
that
it
contains
in
itself
all
the
necessary
elements
of
art
it
may
exercise
the
imagination
and
the
fancy
it
needs
education
in
form
colour
and
composition
as
well
as
the
craft
of
a
practised
hand
to
express
its
language
and
perfect
its
beauty
i
confess
that
when
i
undertook
this
task
i
did
not
anticipate
the
time
i
have
had
to
spend
in
collecting
and
epitomizing
the
many
notices
to
be
found
in
german
french
and
english
authors
on
what
has
been
considered
among
us
at
least
in
this
century
as
merely
a
secondary
art
and
therefore
as
such
of
little
importance
cursory
notices
of
needlework
are
scattered
through
almost
every
book
on
art
and
under
the
head
of
textiles
it
is
usual
to
find
embroidery
acknowledged
as
being
worthy
of
notice
though
not
to
be
named
in
company
with
sculpture
architecture
or
painting
however
beautifully
or
thoughtfully
its
works
may
be
carried
out
i
have
tried
to
show
that
it
deserves
higher
estimation
my
first
intention
was
simply
to
consider
style
good
or
bad
as
it
influences
our
embroidery
of
and
to
find
some
rules
by
which
to
guide
that
of
the
future
in
its
next
phase
but
when
we
search
into
the
fluctuations
of
style
and
their
causes
we
find
they
have
an
historical
succession
and
that
we
must
begin
at
the
beginning
and
trace
them
through
the
life
of
mankind
this
led
me
to
attempt
a
sketch
of
consecutive
styles
their
overlap
and
variations
i
then
found
that
design
patterns
stitches
materials
each
require
a
separate
study
colour
as
applied
to
dyes
claims
to
be
regarded
as
differing
from
pigments
on
the
painter
palette
hangings
dress
and
ecclesiastical
embroideries
each
require
different
rules
and
the
study
of
the
best
examples
of
past
centuries
finally
it
seems
natural
to
dwell
on
our
own
proficiency
in
decorative
work
english
embroidery
has
always
excelled
and
as
we
have
again
returned
to
this
occupation
it
is
worth
while
to
recollect
what
we
have
done
of
old
in
writing
chapters
on
these
subjects
i
have
found
it
most
convenient
to
separate
the
historical
and
æsthetic
questions
from
the
technical
rules
and
the
instruction
which
naturally
belongs
to
a
handbook
of
which
the
purpose
should
be
to
teach
the
easiest
and
most
orthodox
manner
of
executing
the
simplest
and
elaborating
the
finest
works
such
questions
ought
not
to
be
overlaid
with
archæological
inquiries
or
with
the
information
which
only
profits
the
designer
though
of
course
it
is
best
that
the
knowledge
of
design
should
be
part
of
the
education
of
the
craft
perhaps
i
may
be
found
to
have
written
a
book
too
shallow
for
the
learned
too
deep
for
the
frivolous
too
technical
for
the
general
public
and
too
diffuse
for
the
specialist
of
the
craft
i
must
deprecate
these
criticisms
by
saying
that
i
have
written
it
for
the
benefit
of
those
who
know
nothing
of
the
art
and
are
too
much
engaged
to
seek
information
here
and
there
who
yet
being
women
have
to
select
and
to
execute
ornamental
needlework
or
being
artists
are
vexed
at
the
incongruities
and
want
of
intention
in
the
decorations
in
daily
domestic
use
i
have
also
sought
to
help
the
designer
that
he
or
she
may
know
something
of
the
history
of
patterns
and
stitches
if
my
readers
should
be
aware
of
repetitions
they
must
forgive
them
remembering
that
the
same
idea
has
to
be
looked
at
sometimes
from
a
different
point
of
view
according
to
the
use
to
which
it
is
to
be
fitted
the
same
material
may
be
employed
for
and
dress
and
then
the
principles
which
have
been
formulated
have
to
be
varied
i
do
not
shrink
from
repetitions
if
they
make
my
meaning
clear
remembering
the
duke
of
wellington
direction
to
his
private
secretary
never
mind
repetitions
and
your
i
portions
of
these
chapters
have
been
already
published
in
no
of
the
in
and
more
was
delivered
in
three
unpublished
lectures
the
same
year
i
have
acknowledged
and
noted
on
each
page
my
authorities
for
the
facts
i
have
quoted
the
illustrations
that
are
not
original
have
been
copied
from
other
works
by
permission
of
authors
and
publishers
to
all
of
these
i
wish
to
express
my
obligations
and
thanks
especially
to
villiers
stuart
anderson
sir
birdwood
and
sir
layard
for
their
courtesy
in
allowing
me
the
use
of
their
plates
to
my
old
and
valued
friend
newton
i
wish
to
express
my
gratitude
for
his
unstinted
gifts
of
time
and
trouble
bestowed
in
criticizing
and
correcting
my
book
encouraging
me
to
give
it
to
the
public
and
making
it
more
worthy
of
publication
i
have
largely
quoted

besides
many
others
but
these
authorities
often
differ
and
after
weighing
their
arguments
i
have
ventured
to
select
for
my
use
the
facts
and
theories
which
accord
with
my
own
views
facts
are
often
so
interdependent
and
closely
linked
that
it
requires
great
care
to
distinguish
where
they
have
been
shaped
or
coloured
however
unintentionally
to
fit
each
other
or
the
writer
preconceived
ideas
certain
it
is
that
facts
are
but
useless
heaps
till
the
thread
of
a
theory
is
found
on
which
to
hang
them
this
process
like
that
of
stringing
pearls
has
to
be
often
repeated
till
each
occupies
its
right
place
only
those
who
have
adopted
and
cherished
a
theory
can
appreciate
the
pain
of
cutting
the
thread
to
displace
what
appeared
to
be
a
pearl
but
which
from
its
false
position
as
to
date
or
place
or
its
doubtful
origin
has
proved
only
an
empty
manufactured
glass
bead
of
error
this
has
happened
to
me
more
than
once
and
since
i
read
my
lectures
i
have
had
to
change
my
opinions
in
several
instances
if
therefore
any
of
my
readers
should
observe
such
changes
i
hope
they
will
give
me
credit
for
trying
to
convey
what
appears
to
me
on
each
subject
a
correct
impression
footnotes
besides
the
art
i
have
sought
to
give
something
of
the
archæology
of
needlework
now
the
qualifications
for
being
a
teacher
on
such
subjects
are
rarely
to
be
met
with
all
combined
newton
in
his
essays
on
art
and
archæology
says
that
the
archæologist
should
combine
with
the
æsthetic
culture
of
the
artist
and
the
trained
judgment
of
the
historian
and
the
philologist
that
critical
acumen
required
for
classification
and
interpretation
nor
should
that
habitual
suspicion
which
must
ever
attend
the
scrutiny
and
precede
the
warranty
of
evidence
give
too
sceptical
a
bias
to
his
mind
such
authorities

introduction
the
book
of
the
science
of
art
has
yet
to
be
written
art
has
been
called
the
flower
of
life
and
also
the
consoler
adorning
the
existence
of
the
strong
and
bright
sheltering
and
comforting
the
sad
and
solitary
ones
of
the
earth
but
rather
it
resembles
a
tree
covered
with
varied
blossoms
bearing
many
fruits
to
point
out
the
history
and
the
possibilities
in
the
future
of
each
branch
that
shades
refreshes
and
gives
wholesome
fruit
to
the
world
would
be
a
task
worthy
of
a
and
a
pen
of
gold
but
less
ambitious
labourers
in
the
field
of
investigation
which
is
only
as
yet
partly
cultivated
may
each
assist
by
carefully
collecting
a
little
heap
of
ascertained
facts
and
it
is
indeed
the
duty
of
each
as
he
passes
to
add
his
pebble
to
the
slowly
accumulating
cairn
of
recorded
human
knowledge
some
one
has
said
build
your
house
of
little
bricks
of
facts
and
you
will
soon
find
it
inhabited
by
a
body
of
truth
and
that
truth
will
ally
itself
with
other
houses
of
facts
and
in
time
a
cosmical
city
will
arise
my
pebble
is
not
yet
polished
it
is
neither
a
diamond
nor
a
ruby
but
i
think
there
are
a
few
streaks
of
golden
light
in
it
which
i
may
venture
to
add
to
the
daily
accumulating
treasure
in
the
house
of
human
artistic
knowledge
my
object
in
writing
this
volume
is
to
fill
up
an
empty
space
in
the
english
library
of
art
the
great
exponents
of
poetic
thought
verse
sculpture
painting
and
architecture
have
long
since
been
well
interpreted
and
appreciated
men
and
women
have
written
much
and
well
on
these
large
subjects
and
we
may
hope
for
more
ere
long
the
secondary
or
smaller
arts
have
been
hitherto
neglected
by
us
either
treated
merely
as
crafts
to
which
artistic
education
may
give
help
or
as
the
natural
or
inferior
outcome
of
the
primal
arts
having
no
claim
to
the
possession
of
special
laws
and
history
and
yet
when
moses
wrote
and
homer
sang
needlework
was
no
new
thing
it
was
already
consecrated
by
legendary
and
traditionary
custom
to
the
highest
uses
the
gods
themselves
were
honoured
by
its
service
and
it
preceded
written
history
in
recording
heroic
deeds
and
national
triumphs
it
may
be
said
that
ivory
carving
is
sculpture
and
illuminated
manuscripts
and
coloured
glass
windows
are
painting
but
for
metal
work
whether
in
iron
or
gold
a
place
must
be
kept
apart
and
the
same
privileges
are
due
to
embroidery
and
to
metallurgy
all
arts
must
of
necessity
have
their
own
laws
and
rules
which
ensure
their
beauty
of
execution
and
their
special
forms
of
design
these
two
last
from
the
nature
of
their
materials
and
the
modes
of
working
them
must
be
studied
independently
of
any
connection
with
painting
architecture
or
sculpture
yet
if
the
unity
of
nature
is
an
accepted
fact
then
the
acceptance
of
the
unity
of
art
must
follow
art
must
be
considered
as
the
selection
of
natural
phenomena
by
individual
minds
capable
of
assimilating
and
reproducing
them
in
certain
forms
and
with
certain
materials
adapted
to
the
national
taste
needs
and
power
of
appreciation
if
man
can
not
originate
materials
he
can
invent
combinations
and
this
is
art
if
proportion
colour
and
sound
alike
depend
on
certain
mathematical
measurements
and
on
rhythmical
vibrations
there
must
be
a
real
and
tangible
relation
between
these
elements
though
applied
to
obtain
different
results
in
music
as
in
all
art
harmony
is
or
ought
to
be
a
first
consideration
we
have
seen
by
experiment
how
a
note
of
our
scale
can
by
touch
form
geometrical
figures
with
sand
on
a
sheet
of
glass
here
form
obeys
the
force
of
harmony
but
what
is
harmony
by
analogy
we
may
argue
from
the
art
of
music
we
who
believe
that
we
have
acquired
the
knowledge
of
music
as
a
science
beyond
all
preceding
knowledge
of
the
subject
have
in
europe
been
able
to
enjoy
only
our
own
musical
scales
whereas
throughout
the
east
those
accepted
by
the
human
ear
are
very
various
and
appear
to
depart
from
what
to
our
senses
is
harmony
those
oriental
musics
have
either
been
adapted
to
the
oriental
ear
or
the
ear
has
been
adapted
to
appreciate
the
forms
and
laws
of
harmony
with
which
it
came
in
contact
the
same
questions
occur
to
us
while
examining
into
the
different
forms
of
decorative
art
and
we
are
constantly
reminded
that
the
laws
which
should
govern
them
are
perhaps
infinitely
larger
and
wider
than
we
with
our
limited
human
capacities
and
experience
have
hitherto
been
able
to
appreciate
ars
longa
vita
brevis
has
been
so
often
said
that
from
a
proverb
it
has
become
a
truism
but
it
must
continue
to
be
the
refrain
of
those
who
write
upon
art
the
subject
is
so
long
and
its
ramifications
are
so
intricate
that
it
is
difficult
to
include
them
all
under
one
category
my
furthest
aim
here
is
to
trace
back
the
art
of
needlework
to
its
beginning
without
turning
my
eyes
to
the
right
or
the
left
though
i
can
not
help
feeling
myself
drawn
aside
almost
irresistibly
by
casual
glimpses
of
architecture
sculpture
and
painting
which
here
and
there
touch
very
nearly
the
history
of
needlework
except
where
they
visibly
influence
each
other
i
avoid
dealing
with
the
greater
arts
leaving
them
to
the
study
of
the
learned
in
each
special
branch
all
art
however
throws
reflected
lights
and
gleaning
in
the
track
of
those
authors
who
have
preceded
us
we
often
pick
up
valuable
hints
which
we
accept
and
make
use
of
them
gladly
some
writers
have
thought
it
incumbent
on
them
to
give
a
local
habitation
and
an
abiding
place
to
needlework
and
they
have
regarded
it
as
a
branch
of
painting
but
i
can
not
endorse
this
classification
according
to
semper
indeed
it
is
the
of
sculpture
and
painting
instead
of
being
the
offspring
of
either
or
both
as
others
have
maintained
they
have
indeed
such
distinct
functions
that
each
may
justly
boast
its
own
original
sources
painting
is
the
art
of
colour
sculpture
is
that
of
form
embroidery
is
the
art
of
clothing
forms
they
are
all
so
ancient
that
in
seeking
to
ascertain
their
beginnings
and
dates
it
is
difficult
to
fix
the
precedence
of
one
over
another
we
may
compare
distinguish
and
yet
again
change
our
opinions
as
fresh
facts
come
under
our
observation
the
art
of
needlework
reached
its
climax
long
ago
and
is
now
very
old
history
and
faded
rags
are
the
only
witnesses
to
its
fabulous
glories
in
classical
oriental
and
early
mediæval
days
it
would
appear
that
nothing
new
remains
to
be
invented
copies
of
past
styles
and
selections
from
the
scraps
we
retain
and
value
as
models
are
all
that
we
can
boast
of
now
rock
truly
says
that
few
persons
of
the
present
day
have
the
faintest
idea
of
the
labour
the
money
the
time
often
bestowed
of
old
upon
embroideries
which
had
been
designed
as
well
as
wrought
by
the
hands
of
men
and
women
each
in
their
own
craft
the
best
and
ablest
of
their
day
time
is
too
short
our
life
too
densely
crowded
to
allow
leisure
for
the
extravagance
of
what
is
after
all
only
a
luxury
of
art
no
longer
a
civilizer
as
of
old
but
just
an
efflorescence
of
our
culture
embroidery
is
now
essentially
decoration
and
nothing
more
it
is
intended
to
appeal
to
the
sense
of
beauty
of
the
eye
rather
than
to
the
imagination
the
designer
for
needlework
should
be
an
artist

he
need
not
be
a

you
may
omit
this
art
altogether
and
you
need
be
none

clothed
and
lodged
yet
it
is
worthy
of
careful
study
as
historical

the

sometimes
with

by

and
its
decorations
by

and

such
as
the
different

of

or
even
by
such

as

the

and
outcome
of
the
laws
of
the
tribes
that
flowed
consecutively
over
europe
from
the
east
by
the
institutions
which
remained
immutably
fixed
on
their
native
soil
such
as
those
of
the

of

of

is
being
reconstructed
how
valuable
is
every
witness
to
the
ancient
records
which
were
fading
into
myths
in
the
memories
of
men
how
joyfully
is
each
little
fact
hailed
as
a
landmark
in
the
general
fog
of

now
embroidery
may
boast
that
it
is
a
source
of
landmarks
for
all
time
without
presuming
to
fix
a
date
for
its
first
beginning
that
which
i
wish
to
impress
on
the
mind
of
the
reader
is
the
long
continuity
of
the
art
of
needlework
the
sense
of
antiquity
induces
reverence
and
i
claim
for
the
needle
an
older
and
more
illustrious
age
than
can
be
accorded
to
the
brush
while
the
great
pendulum
of
time
has
swung
art
in
sculpture
painting
and
architecture
from
its
cradle
as
in
mycenæ
to
its
throne
in
athens
in
the
days
of
pericles
and
then
back
again
to
the
basest
poverty
of
decaying
rome
needle
work
continually
refreshed
from
eastern
inspiration
never
has
fallen
so
low
though
it
had
never
aspired
as
high
as
its
greater
sister
arts
the
stuffs
and
fabrics
of
various
materials
of
the
egyptians
chinese
assyrians
and
chaldeans
are
named
in
the
earliest
records
of
the
human
race
how
much
these
decorations
depended
on
weaving
and
how
much
on
embroidery
with
the
needle
may
in
each
case
be
disputed
the
products
of
the
babylonian
looms
are
alluded
to
in
the
book
of
joshua
their
beauty
tempted
achan
to
rescue
them
when
jericho
fell
and
ezekiel
speaks
of
the
embroideries
of
canneh
haran
and
eden
as
well
as
of
their
cloths
of
purple
and
blue
and
their
chests
of
garments
of
divers
colours
all
these
fabrics
are
named
as
merchandise
and
were
carried
to
the
and
thence
over
the
ancient
world
by
the
phœnicians
the
great
shipowners
and
dealers
of
the
east
indian
needlework
and
design
is
years
old
and
the
long
perspective
of
egyptian
art
while
leading
us
still
further
back
into
unlimited
periods
shows
it
changing
so
slowly
that
we
feel
as
if
it
had
been
all
but
stationary
from
the
beginning
the
chinese
claim
years
as
the
life
of
their
history
but
if
as
is
now
suggested
their
civilization
is
accadian
or
their
wonderful
artistic
and
scientific
knowledge
may
have
been
fragments
of
the
great
dispersal
secreted
and
preserved
behind
the
wonderful
wall
of
stone
silence
and
law
where
it
has
lain
fossilized
ever
since
one
can
not
but
wonder
at
the
perfection
of
the
textile
manufactures
of
the
chinese
their
marvellous
embroideries
and
the
peculiar
modes
of
construction
and
design
throughout
their
arts
which
have
shown
but
few
moments
of
change
in
growth
scarcely
a
sign
of
evolution
and
we
may
fairly
surmise
that
this
accadian
culture
if
such
it
be
is
reflected
from
antediluvian
tradition
the
archæology
of
oriental
art
is
most
interesting
we
contemplate
with
awe
the
vast
splendours
of
the
consecutive
civilizations
of
the
east
the
ancient
richness
and
fertility
of
the
whole
of
the
asiatic
continent
the
genius
for
empire
and
for
commerce
the
creative
power
which
seemed
to
pour
itself
forth
unchecked
by
wars
and
conquests
the
great
dynasties
which
rose
and
fell
leaving
behind
them
gigantic
works
and
the
records
of
fabulous
luxury
in
the
empires
of
china
assyria
india
and
persia
of
which
the
remains
have
been
of
late
years
excavated
deciphered
and
confronted
with
the
historical
texts
which
we
have
inherited
and
had
only
partly
believed
and
studying
these
new
aspects
of
history
we
are
saddened
thinking
that
the
sunrise
comes
to
us
from
shining
over
desert
sands
or
the
mounds
of
empty
cities
where
the
lion
and
the
jackal
reassert
their
primeval
possession
or
where
the
european
and
the
tartar
from
the
west
and
from
the
east
dispute
their
rights
to
suzerainty
we
are
dazzled
and
confused
when
we
look
back
to
those
great
days
when
the
kingdoms
sent
forth
whole
tribes
eastward
to
the
confines
of
asia
southward
over
india
and
westward
over
europe
and
we
bow
reverently
before
the
mighty
power
that
led
the
jews
by
a
promise
and
a
hope
across
the
seething
nationalities
through
the
long
passage
of
time
from
abraham
to
solomon
and
which
is
again
giving
into
the
hands
of
those
men
so
much
power
in
shaping
the
destiny
of
mankind
through
their
great
riches
moses
commanded
the
hebrew
people
to
lend
and
never
to
borrow
they
have
obeyed
his
precept
except
in
art
to
that
they
have
lent
or
given
nothing
there
is
no
national
jewish
art
for
music
only
do
they
show
artistic
genius
and
that
is
european
and
not
oriental
as
illustrating
their
lack
of
intuitive
decorative
art
one
need
only
refer
to
the
architecture
of
the
first
second
and
third
temple
buildings
which
apparently
reflected
babylonian
and
semitic
influences
on
an
early
chaldean
type
the
embroideries
mentioned
by
different
writers
from
moses
to
josephus
appear
to
have
had
always
a
babylonian
or
later
a
persian
inspiration
this
absence
of
artistic
genius
is
very
remarkable
in
a
people
that
had
its
origin
in
the
eastern
centre
from
whence
all
art
has
radiated
the
reason
that
so
little
survives
of
ancient
embroidery
is
evident
woollen
stuffs
and
threads
decay
quickly
the
moth
and
rust
do
corrupt
them
and
the
very
few
ancient
bits
that
remain
have
been
preserved
by
the
embalming
process
which
has
kept
the
contents
of
tombs
from
becoming
dust
as
to
more
modern
embroideries
we
ought
to
be
thankful
that
the
art
has
had
its
fashions
otherwise
the
world
would
be
overwhelmed
with
shabby
rags
human
nature
has
a
tendency
to
dislike
the
the
fashion
of
the
last
generation
that
which
our
mothers
worked
or
wore
is
an
object
for
affectionate
sentiment
and
the
best
specimens
alone
are
preserved
that
which
belonged
to
our
grandfathers
and
grandmothers
has
receded
into
the
rococo
and
a
few
more
generations
take
us
back
to
the
antique
of
which
so
little
survives
from
wear
and
tear
carelessness
and
theft
that
we
put
away
and
preserve
it
as
being
curious
and
precious
we
may
hope
that
the
general
law
of
the
survival
of
the
fittest
has
guarded
what
is
most
remarkable
certain
works
have
been
consecrated
by
the
hands
that
executed
them
or
by
that
of
the
donor
or
by
the
purpose
for
which
they
were
bestowed
and
are
mostly
preserved
in
churches
or
national
museums
of
these
there
are
vestments
and
altar
decorations
worked
by
royal
and
noble
ladies
and
coronation
garments
given
by
queens
and
empresses
such
as
queen
gisela
and
the
empress
kunigunda
at
prague
and
bamberg
and
charlemagne
dalmatic
at
the
vatican
described
in
the
chapter
on
ecclesiastical
embroideries
sculptured
effigies
help
us
as
to
embroidered
patterns
for
our
forefathers
often
actually
copied
in
bronze
or
stone
the
patterns
of
the
garments
in
which
the
body
was
buried
or
at
any
rate
those
the
man
had
worn
in
his
life
of
these
king
john
monument
at
worcester
and
the
surcoat
of
the
black
prince
at
canterbury
are
remarkable
examples
the
succeeding
chapters
will
contain
sketches
of
the
history
of
the
different
stitches
and
of
the
best
examples
of
stitch
and
style
remaining
to
us
and
i
shall
try
to
extract
from
both
the
best
suggestions
for
guidance
in
design
and
handicraft
embroidery
from
its
nature
is
essentially
the
woman
art
it
needs
a
sedentary
life
industry
and
patience
it
does
not
require
a
room
to
itself
and
the
worker
may
leave
it
at
any
moment
between
two
stitches
when
called
to
other
duties
nunneries
produced
the
finest
work
of
the
dark
and
middle
ages
and
their
teaching
inaugurated
the
workrooms
in
the
palaces
and
castles
where
young
girls
whether
royal
noble
or
gentle
were
trained
in
embroidery
as
an
accomplishment
and
a
household
duty
the
history
of
domestic
embroidery
ought
to
be
looked
upon
as
that
of
an
important
factor
in
the
humanizing
effect
of
æsthetic
culture
the
woman
of
the
house
has
always
been
strong
to
fulfil
her
part
in
this
civilizing
influence
with
the
implement
which
custom
has
awarded
to
her
every
man
in
the
ancient
east
began
his
life
under
the
tent
or
in
the
palace
adorned
by
the
hands
of
his
mother
and
her
maidens
and
his
home
was
made
beautiful
by
his
wife
and
his
sisters
and
their
slaves
there
as
in
mediæval
homes
lessons
of
morality
and
religion
and
the
love
and
fame
of
noble
deeds
were
taught
by
the
painting
of
the
needle
to
the
minds
of
the
young
men
who
would
have
scorned
more
direct
teaching
and
the
children
felt
the
influence
as
the
women
wove
what
the
bards
sang
alas
we
have
but
few
specimens
of
embroideries
of
which
we
know
the
history
earlier
than
the
tenth
and
eleventh
centuries
yet
from
the
days
of
the
books
of
the
old
testament
and
the
song
of
the
siege
of
troy
down
to
the
present
time
the
woman
of
the
house
has
adorned
not
only
herself
and
her
dear
lord
but
she
has
hung
the

the

the

the

before
closing
this
introduction
i
will
take
the
opportunity
to
protest
against
the
abuse
of
the
phrase
high
art
it
is
generally
appropriated
by
that
which
is
the
lowest
and
most
feeble
an
old
design
for
a
chair
or
table
by
no
means
remarkable
originally
but
cheaply
copied
and
covered
with
a
quaint
and
dismal
cretonne
or
poorly
worked
pattern
of
which
the
design
is
neither
new
nor
artistic
is
introduced
by
the
upholsterer
as
belonging
to
high
art
furniture
the
epithet
has
succeeded
to
what
was
once
fashionable
and
elegant
to
get
rid
of
carpets
and
put
down
rugs
to
hang
up
rows
of
plates
instead
of
family
portraits
this
also
is
high
art
likewise
gowns
lumped
upon
the
shoulders
with
all
the
folds
drawn
across
instead
of
hanging
draperies
the
term
is
never
used
when
we
speak
of
the
great
arts
painting
sculpture
and
architecture
it
is
in
fact
only
the
slang
of
the
the
upholsterer
and
milliner
all
true
art
is
very
high
indeed
and
apparent
and
needs
not
to
be
introduced
with
a
puff
it
sits
enthroned
between
poetry
and
history
even
those
who
are
ignorant
of
its
laws
feel
its
influence
and
the
soothing
grace
which
it
sheds
falling
like
the
rain
equally
upon
the
just
and
the
unjust
man
nature
always
responds
to
the
truly
high
and
beautiful
only
the
most
degraded
are
deprived
of
this
source
of
happiness
and
there
are
but
few
women
till
debased
by
cruelty
misery
or
drink
that
do
not
try
in
some
humble
way
but
especially
with
their
needle
to
adorn
their
own
persons
their
children
and
their
homes
and
if
their
art
is
not
high
it
yet
has
the
power
to
elevate
them
while
the
most
ambitious
women
try
a
higher
flight
into
the
regions
of
poetry
literature
painting
and
even
sculpture
why
has
no
woman
ever
been
an
architect
millions
have
enjoyed
the
art
of
the
needle
for
thousands
of
years
and
it
will
continue
to
be
a
solace
and
a
delight
as
long
as
the
world
lasts
for
like
all
art
it
gives
the
ever
new
joy

chapter
i
style
in
venturing
to
approach
so
great
a
subject
as
the
history
of
style
i
would
beg
my
readers
to
believe
how
well
i
am
aware
that
on
each
point
much
more
has
been
already
carefully
treated
by
previous
writers
than
will
fall
within
the
limits
of
a
chapter
that
is
intended
only
to
throw
light
on
textile
art
and
especially
on
embroidery
i
suppose
it
is
the
same
in
all
subjects
of
human
speculation
which
are
worthy
of
serious
study
and
therefore
i
ought
not
to
have
been
surprised
to
find
how
much
has
already
been
written
on
needlework
and
embroidery
and
how
unconsciously
i
at
least
have
passed
by
and
ignored
these
notices
till
it
struck
me
that
i
ought
to
know
something
of
the
history
and
principles
of
the
art
which
with
others
i
was
striving
to
revive
and
improve
then
new
and
old
facts
crowded
round
me
and
became
significant
and
interesting
i
longed
to
know
something
of
the
first
worker
and
the
first
needle
and
behold
the
needle
has
been
found
among
the
débris
of
the
life
of
the
neolithic
made
of
bone
and
very
neatly
fashioned
alas
the
workwoman
and
her
work
are
gone
to
dust
but
is
the
needle
proof
positive
that
the
craft
existed
before
the
last
glacial
period
in
britain
how
long
ago
this
was
we
may
conjecture
but
can
never
finally
ascertain
then
i
find
embroidery
named
by
the
earliest
historians
by
every
poet
of
antiquity
and
by
the
first
travellers
in
the
east
and
it
has
been
the
subject
of
laws
and
enactments
from
the
date
of
the
code
of
manu
in
india
to
the
present
century
one
becomes
eager
to
systematize
all
this
information
and
to
share
with
the
workers
and
thinkers
of
the
craft
the
pleasure
found
in
its
study
perhaps
what
is
here
collected
may
appear
somewhat
bald
and
disjointed
but
antiquity
both
human
and
historical
is
apt
to
be
bald
and
its
dislocation
and
disjointed
condition
are
owing
to
the
frequent
cataclysms
physical
political
and
social
which
needlework
has
survived
bringing
down
to
us
the
same
stitches
which
served
the
same
purposes
for
decoration
under
the
code
of
manu
and
adorned
the
sanctuary
in
the
wilderness
and
those
stitches
probably
were
not
new
then
i
propose
to
give
a
slight
sketch
of
the
origin
of
the
styles
that
have
followed
each
other
noting
the
national
influences
that
have
displaced
or
altered
them
and
the
overlap
of
style
caused
by
outside
events
first
i
would
define
what
style
means
style
is
the
mark
impressed
on
art
by
a
national
period
short
or
long
it
fades
it
wanes
and
then
some
historical
element
enters
on
the
scene
which
carries
with
it
new
materials
needs
and
tastes
either
imported
or
springing
up
under
the
new
conditions
the
style
of
the
day
in
art
and
literature
alters
so
perceptibly
that
all
who
have
had
any
artistic
training
are
at
once
aware
of
the
difference
of
late
years
the
science
of
history
has
been
greatly
assisted
by
the
science
of
language
when
the
mute
language
of
art
shall
have
been
patiently
deciphered
the
historian
will
be
furnished
with
new
powers
in
his
researches
after
truth
the
first
ineffaceable
is
a
the
second
a
this
is
proved
by
the
history
of
needlework
as
the
world
grows
old
its
youth
becomes
more
interesting
alas
the
childhood
of
mankind
is
so
distant
and
it
was
so
long
before
it
learned
its
letters
that
but
few
facts
have
come
down
to
us
on
which
we
may
firmly
build
our
theories
yet
we
must
acknowledge
the
great
stride
that
has
been
made
in
the
last
few
years
in
the
scientific
mode
of
extracting
history
from
the
ruins
and
tombs
and
even
the
of
the
past
whole
epochs
which
fifty
years
ago
were
as
blank
as
the
then
maps
of
central
africa
are
being
now
gradually
covered
with
landmarks
layard
rawlinson
newton
botta
rassam
schliemann
birch
smith
and
a
crowd
of
archæologists
and
even
unscientific
explorers
are
collecting
the
materials
from
which
the
history
of
mankind
is
being
reconstructed
from
them
i
have
sought
information
about
the
art
of
embroidery
and
i
find
that
semper
gives
it
a
high
as
to
its
antiquity
making
it
the
foundation
and
of
all
art
he
clothes
not
only
man
but
architecture
with
the
products
of
the
loom
and
the
needle
and
derives
from
them
in
succession
painting
and
sculpture
style
has
to
be
considered
in
two
different
aspects
from
two
different
standpoints
first
historically
and
archæologically
distinguishing
and
dating
the
forms
which
follow
upon
each
other
and
tracing
them
back
in
the
order
of
their
natural
sequence
so
as
to
guide
us
to
the
root
nay
to
the
seed
of
each
and
all
art
the
subsidiary
art
of
embroidery
in
its
highest
form
the
handmaid
of
architecture
is
full
of
suggestion
and
may
assist
us
greatly
in
the
search
which
culminates
in
the
text
of
in
the
beginning
the
other
point
of
view
from
which
style
should
be
considered
is
the
æsthetic
this
enables
us
to
criticize
the
works
of
different
periods
extracting
as
far
as
we
may
rules
for
the
beautiful
and
the
commendable
and
seeking
to
find
the
why
also
observing
the
operation
of
the
law
by
which
decay
follows
too
soon
after
the
best
and
highest
efforts
of
genius
thought
and
invention
in
art
my
present
object
is
the
history
of
consecutive
styles
in
so
far
as
they
concern
needlework
alas
nothing
endures
this
law
is
acknowledged
by
goethe
when
he
makes
jove
answer
venus
who
bewailed
that
all
that
is
beautiful
must
die
that
he
had
only
bestowed
beauty
on
the
evanescent
it
seems
as
if
the
moment
the
best
is
attained
men
ceasing
to
struggle
for
the
better
fall
back
at
once
hopelessly
and
become
mere
imitators
they
no
longer
follow
a
type
but
copy
a
model
and
then
copy
the
copy
imitation
is
a
precipice
a
swift
descent
through
poverty
of
thought
into
the
chaos
of
mannerism
in
the
place
of
style
the
imitative
tendency
as
existing
in
all
human
minds
can
not
be
ignored
or
despised
in
individuals
it
accompanies
enthusiasm
for
the
beautiful
and
the
graceful
charm
of
sympathy
it
maintains
continuity
between
specimen
and
specimen
between
artist
and
artist
between
century
and
century
and
it
is
this
which
enables
an
adept
to
say
with
certainty
of
consecutive
styles
this
is
spanish
work
of
the
sixteenth
century
that
is
flemish
or
german
work
of
the
seventeenth
century
the
theory
of
development
and
of
the
survival
of
the
fittest
has
been
worked
so
hard
that
it
sometimes
breaks
down
under
the
task
imposed
upon
it
it
would
need
to
include
death
in
its
procedure
in
our
creed
death
means
the
moment
of
entrance
into
a
higher
existence
but
in
art
it
means
extinction
leaving
behind
neither
a
history
nor
an
artisan
only
perhaps
an
infinitely
small
tradition
like
the
grain
of
corn
preserved
in
the
wrappings
of
a
mummy
from
which
at
first
accident
and
then
care
and
culture
may
evoke
a
future
life
the
various
ways
in
which
art
has
appeared
at
the
beginning
can
not
here
be
discussed
nor
how
the
chinese
and
hindu
may
have
leapt
into
a
perfection
which
has
stood
still
for
thousands
of
years
protected
alike
from
expansion
as
from
destruction
by
the
swaddling
bands
of
codified
custom
while
greek
art
rose
like
the
sun
shone
over
the
civilized
world
and
set
never
again
to
see
another
epoch
of
glory
these
subjects
must
be
left
for
the
study
of
the
anthropological
philosopher
who
is
working
for
the
assistance
and
guidance
of
the
future
historian
of
art
style
in
needlework
has
passed
through
many
phases
since
the
aboriginal
prehistoric
woman
with
the
bone
needle
drew
together
the
edges
of
the
skins
of
the
animals
she
had
prepared
for
food
for
absolute
necessity
in
forming
the
garments
and
covering
the
tent
needlework
need
go
no
further
than
the
seam
this
however
in
the
woven
or
plaited
material
must
fray
where
it
is
shaped
and
become
fringed
at
the
edges
every
long
seam
is
a
suggestion
and
every
shaped
edge
a
snare
the
fringe
lends
itself
to
the
tassel
and
the
shaped
seam
suggests
a
pattern
are
needed
for
binding
the
web
and
before
she
is
aware
of
it
the
worker
finds
herself
adorning
and
the
craft
enters
the
outskirts
of
the
region
of
art
the
humble
early
efforts
at
decoration
called
by
the
french
primitif
are
the
first
we
know
and
class
and
are
found
in
all
savage
attempts
at
ornament
this
style
consists
mainly
of
straight
lines
zigzags
wavy
lines
dots
and
little
discs
gold
discs
of
many
sizes
and
worked
with
a
variety
of
patterns
are
found
equally
in
the
tomb
of
the
warrior
at
mycenæ
and
in
ashantee
accompanied
in
both
cases
with
gold
masks
covering
the
faces
of
the
dead
the
discs
or
buttons
remind
us
of
those
found
in
etruscan
tombs
though
the
execution
of
these
last
is
more
advanced
they
appear
to
be
the
origin
of
the
clavus
or
pattern
woven
into
silks
in
the
palace
of
the
cæsars
the
last
recorded
survival
of
this
pattern
is
in
woven
materials
for
ecclesiastical
purposes
in
the
middle
ages
of
very
early
needlework
we
only
find
here
and
there
a
fragment
illustrated
occasionally
by
passing
allusions
in
poetry
and
history
the
ornamental
art
of
hissarlik
is
so
primitive
that
we
can
not
feel
that
it
has
any
resemblance
to
that
described
as
trojan
by
homer
who
probably
adorned
his
song
with
the
art
he
had
known
elsewhere
we
know
not
what
the
actual
heroes
of
the
iliad
and
odyssey
wore
but
we
do
know
that
what
homer
describes
he
must
have
seen
was
homer
therefore
the
contemporary
of
the
siege
of
troy
or
does
he
not
rather
speak
of
the
customs
and
costumes
of
his
own
time
and
apply
them
to
the
traditions
of
the
heroic
ages
of
greece
whatever
be
the
date
of
homer
himself
we
can
with
the
help
of
contemporary
survivals
reconstruct
the
house
and
the
hall
and
even
furnish
them
and
clothe
the
women
and
the
princes
the
beggars
and
the
herdsmen
from
the
remains
of
egyptian
babylonian
and
assyrian
art
we
can
perceive
their
differences
and
their
affinities
it
is
from
textile
fragments
found
mostly
in
tombs
that
we
obtain
dates
and
can
suggest
them
for
other
specimens
the
funeral
tent
of
shishak
at
boulac
is
most
valuable
as
showing
what
was
the
textile
art
of
that
early
period

the
corselet
which
according
to
herodotus
was
given
by
amasis
king
of
egypt
to
the
temple
of
minerva
at
lindos
in
rhodes
was
possibly
worked
in
this
style
for
babylonian
embroidery
was
greatly
prized
in
egypt
and
imitated
the
second
corselet
given
by
amasis
to
the
lacædemonians

worked
in

the
seventh
century
amongst
the
arms
painted
on
the

of
the
tomb

styles

voyages
the
bowls
found
in
cyprus

engraved
in
the
september
number
of
the
magazine

are
most
interesting
illustrations
of
the
meeting
of
two
national
styles
the
assyrian
and
the
egyptian

shield
of
achilles
must
in
general
design
have
resembled
these
bowls
see
pl
they
also
recall
the
description
by
josephus
of
the
temple

at
jerusalem
which
were
babylonian

which
was
the
carrier
of
all

dropped
specimens
here
and
there
for
many
hundred
years
along
the
borders
of
the
mediterranean
and
the
coasts
of
spain
we
fancy
we
can
trace
her
by
the
western
shores
of
africa
and
even
to
america
otherwise
how
could
it
happen
that
a
in
peru
should
so
nearly
resemble
some
of
those
wrappings
found
at
saccarah
in
egypt
woven
in
precisely
the
same
tapestry
fashion
among
the
puzzling
phenomena
due
probably
to
phœnician
commerce
is
the
complete
suite
of
the
sacerdotal
ornaments
of
a
high
priest
found
in
his
tomb
now
in
the
vatican
museum
this
reminds
us
of
other
specimens
of
archaic
art
from
distant
sources
that
our
attention
is
forcibly
arrested
and
we
wonder
whence
they
came
and
whether
they
were
collected
from
alien
civilizations
by
the
phœnicians
before
they
dispersed
them
certain
egyptian
sculptures
of
deformed
and
repulsive
divinities
idols
of
the
baser
sort
are
most
interesting
and
puzzling
by
their
affinity
in
style
to
the
and
the
art
of
mexico
while
they
are
entirely
unlike
that
of
egypt
if
atlantis
and
its
arts
never
existed
it
may
be
suggested
that
it
was
the
eastern
coast
of
america
that
was
spoken
of
under
that
name
by
the
egyptian
priest
with
whom
herodotus
conversed
the
babylonian
and
ninevite
embroideries
carefully
executed
on
their
have
a
masculine
look
which
suggests
the
design
of
an
artist
and
the
work
of
slaves
there
is
no
following
out
of
graceful
fancies
one
set
of
selected
forms
each
probably
with
a
symbolical
intention
following
another
the
effect
as
seen
on
the
sculptures
in
the
british
museum
is
royally
gorgeous
and
one
feels
that
creatures
inferior
to
monarchs
or
satraps
could
never
have
aspired
to
such
splendours
probably
the
embroidery
on
their
corselets
was
executed
in
gold
wire
treated
as
thread
and
taken
through
the
material
and
the
same
system
was
carried
out
in
adorning
the
trappings
of
the
horses
and
the
chariots
the
solid
masses
of
embroidery
may
have
been
afterwards
subjected
to
the
action
of
the
hammer
which
would
account
for
their
appearing

the

appears
to
have
been
naturalistic
though
conventionalized
we
may
judge
of
their
styles
for
different
purposes
by
the
reliefs
in
the
british
museum
from
their
veils
and

at
a
later
date
when
they
had
crossed
their

with
that

we
may
imagine
the
mystical

of
the

as
described
by
josephus
in

as
much
as
possible

all

we
enjoy
tracing
them
to
the
various
looms
named
in
verse
and
history
where
they
were
adorned
with
embroidery
and
then
either
became
articles
of
commerce

were
stored
away
to
be
kept

to
us
the
history
of
babylonia
has
an
interest
beyond
that
of
egypt
on
account
of
its
more
intimate
connection
with
our
own
civilization
babylon
was

which
it

the
science

of

wonderful

the

became

the
hangings
of

are
so
carefully
described
in

we
can
see
in

the

we
can
appreciate
how
little
of
egyptian
art
and
style
the
children
of
israel
brought
back
from
their
long
captivity
and
how
soon
they
reverted
to
their
ancient
chaldean
proclivities
after
returning
to
their
wandering
life
of
the
tent

near
nimroud
set
up
by
shalmaneser
to
celebrate
his
conquest
of

and
sidon
we
find
a
portable
tabernacle
evidently
meant
to
accompany
the
army
on

march
it
is
not
much
larger
than
a
bed
with
transverse
poles
for
drawing
the
curtains
all
fringed
with

egyptian

is
perhaps
that
of
which
we
have
the
most
early

be

at

the
are
all
unmistakably
the
consecutive
outcome
of
the

which
had
totally
disappeared
in

of

the
connection
between
indian
and
egyptian
early
art
appears
to
have
existed
only
in
their
use
of
the
lotus
as
an
emblem
and
a
constant
decoration
but
their
manner
of
employing
it
was
characteristically
different
pl
and
the
phœnicians
carried
with
them
the
seeds
of
the
egyptian
style
over
the
ancient
world
but
these
seeds
only
took
root
and
flourished
on
the
soil
of
greece
the
imitations
of
egyptian
style
reappeared
in
rome
and
again
in
france
under
the
two
empires
in
both
cases
they
were
only
imitations
and
neither
had
any
permanent
influence
on
the
art
of
their
day
i
shall
have
to
allude
very
often
to
our
eastern
sources
of
artistic
culture
our
own
aryan
ancestors
were
so
impregnated
with
beautiful
ideas
that
we
must
believe
that
we
inherit
from
them
all
our
graceful
appreciation
of
naturalistic
ornament
but
even
aryan
art
met
with
reverses
on
its
eastern
soil
from
which
it
constantly
rose
again
and
renewed
itself
the
mongols
crushed
for
a
time
the
element
of
beauty
in
india
they
introduced
a
barbarous
and
hideous
style
which
has
its
only
counterpart
in
that
of
central
america
it
was
the
produce
of
a
religion
superstitious
cruel
and
devilish
the
aryan
art
of
india
which
was
elegant
and
spiritual
was
revived
by
the
kindred
influence
of
persia
and
by
the
renaissance
in
europe
italian
and
other
artists
were
employed
in
india
and
the
spirit
of
aerial
grace
and
the
delicate
sense
of
beauty
in
natural
forms
blossomed
afresh
and
flourished
for

the
code
of
manu
from
to
has
secured
to
the
village
system
of
india
a
permanent
class
of
hereditary
artistic
workmen
and
artisans
who
have
through
these
years
at
least
been
trained
to
the
same
manipulations
and
who
therefore
translate
any
foreign
work
which
is
placed
before
them
to
copy
into
something
characteristically
indian
indian
art
has
borrowed
freely
from
all
sources
without
losing
its
own
individuality
it
has
been
said
there
is
nothing
newer
in
it
than
of
the
sixteenth
century
and
even
then
nothing
was
original
especially
in
the
minor
arts
but
this
is
owing
to
the
hindu
being
equally
endowed
with
assimilative
and
receptive
capacity
so
that
in
the
hands
of
the
indian
craftsman
everything
assumes
the
distinctive
expression
of
ancient
indian
art
in
india
everything
is
but
as
the
spirit
of
its
decorative
art
is
that
of
a
crystallized
tradition
its
type
has
remained
almost
unaltered
since
the
aryan
genius
culminated
in
the
ramâyana
and
mahabhârata
and
yet
each
artisan
in
india
is
a
true
artist
in
art
unfortunately
the
letter
killeth
and
true
artists
as
they
are
the
ancient
traditions
bind
and
cramp
them
while
the
ancient
materials
the
dyes
and
the
absolute
command
of
time
are
failing
so
that
the
beauty
of
indian
embroideries
and
other
decorations
is
gradually
reducing
itself
to
mannerism
which
is
more
dangerous
to
art
than
even
had
been
the
vicissitudes
of
war
for
when
peaceful
days
returned
and
the
waves
of
conquest
had
subsided
the
ancient
arts
were
found
again
deeply
embedded
in
the
traditions
of
the
people
they
gradually
returned
to
their
old
ways
which
are
so
indelible
in
the
hindu
mind
that
they
will
perhaps
survive
even
the
fashions
of
from
yates
account
it
would
appear
that
europe
had
been
fertilized
with
taste
in
art
and
manufactures
from
the
east
by
three
different
routes
the
egyptian
civilization
with
all
its
eastern
antecedents
and
traditions
came
to
us
by
the
mediterranean
and

the
merchants
who
brought
it
through
those
channels
the
etruscans

were

golden
ornaments

coral

our
knowledge
of
their
advanced
and
most
singular
art
comes
out
of
their
tombs
in
which
the

was
laid
with
all
his
arms
and
his
horse
and
his
precious
possessions
splendidly
clothed
according

that
he
would

them

are
almost
always
beautiful

is
melancholy
to
have
to
confess
that
in
this

in

is
inimitable

theory
is
that
the

chief
import
of

style
being
embroideries
therefore
the

arriving

gave
the

the
motives

may
or
may
not
be

no

that

believes

are
derived
from
or
at
least
influenced
by
what
he
had
learnt
of
the
babylonian
and
chaldean
embroideries
this
is
very
probable
and
would
account
for
his
poetical
design
on
the
shield
of
achilles
in
which
his
own
inspiration
dictated
the
possibilities
of
the
then
practised
arts
of
asia
of
which
the
fame
and
occasional
glimpses
were
already
drifting
westward
plate
the
description
of
the
shield
of
achilles
is
as
follows
hephaistos
the
lame
god
threw
bronze
that
weareth
not
into
the
fire
and
tin
and
precious
gold
and
silver
he
fashioned
the
shield
great
and
strong
with
five
folds
or
circles
in
the
shield
itself
then
wrought
he
the
earth
and
the
sea
and
the
unwearying
sun
and
the
moon
waxing
to
its
full
and
the
signs
every
one
wherewith
the
heavens
are
crowned
also
he
fashioned
therein
two
cities
of
mortal
men
and
here
were
marriage
feasts
and
brides
led
home
by
the
blaze
of
torches
young
men
whirling
in
the
dance
and
the
women
standing
each
at
her
door
marvelling
then
a
street
fight
and
the
elders
sitting
in
judgment
the
other
city
was
being
besieged
and
there
is
a
wonderful
description
of
the
battle
fought
on
the
river
banks
and
strife
tumult
and
death
personified
and
mingling
in
the
fight
then
he
set
in
the
shield
the
labours
of
the
husbandman
this
is
so
exquisitely
beautiful
that
with
difficulty
i
refrain
from
quoting
it
all
he
wrought
thereon
a
herd
of
kine
with
upright
horns
and
the
kine
were
fashioned
of
gold
and
tin
and
herdsmen
of
gold
were
following
after
them
also
did
the
glorious
lame
god
devise
a
like
unto
that
which
once
in
wide
knosos
daidalos
wrought
for
ariadne
of
the
lovely
tresses
there
were
youths
dancing
and
maidens
of
costly
wooing
their
hands
upon
their
waists
and
now
would
they
run
round
with
deft
feet
exceedingly
lightly
and
now
would
they
run
in
lines
to
meet
each
other
and
a
great
company
stood
round
the
lovely
dance
in
joy
and
among
them
a
divine
minstrel
was
making
music
on
his
lyre
and
through
the
midst
of
them
as
he
began
his
strain
two
tumblers
whirled
also
he
set
therein
the
great
might
of
the
river
of
ocean
around
the
utmost
rim
of
the
shield
there
is
indeed
every
proof
that
greek
art
was
the
joint
product
of
the
egyptian
and
assyrian
civilizations
their
amalgamation
gave
birth
to
the
archaic
style
struggling
to
express
the
strength
and
the
beauty
of
man
half
heroic
half
divine
gradually
all
the
surrounding
decorations
of
life
assumed
as
a
governing
principle
and
motive
the
worth
of
noble
beauty
the
greeks
were
the
first
artists
they
broke
away
from
the
ancient
trammels
of
customary
forms
and
replaced
law
with
liberty
of
thought
and
tradition
with
poetry
they
destroyed
no
old
ideas
but
they
selected
appropriated
and
evoked
beauty
from
every
source
from
the
great
days
of
athens
we
may
date
the
moment
when
materials
became
entirely
subservient
to
art
and
the
minds
of
individual
men
were
stamped
on
their
works
and
dated
them
phases
indeed
followed
each
other
showing
the
links
of
tradition
which
still
bound
men
minds
together
to
a
certain
extent
and
formed
the
general
style
of
the
day
yet
there
was
in
art
from
that
time
life
sometimes
death
but
then
a
resurrection
it
appears
from
classical
writers
that
about
greek
art
had
thrown
itself
into
many
new
forms
painting
for
example
had
tried
all
themes
excepting
landscapes
we
are
told
that
within
the
space
of
years
the
art
had
passed
through
every
technical
stage
from
the
tinted
profile
system
of
polygnotus
to
the
proper
pictorial
system
of
natural
scenes
composed
with
natural
backgrounds
and
peiraiïkos
is
named
as
an
artist
of
genre
a
painter
of
barbers
and
cobblers
booths
asses
eatables
and
realistic
subjects
i
suppose
there
is
no
doubt
that
all
the
romans
knew
or
felt
of
art
was
borrowed
directly
or
indirectly
from
greece
first
through
phœnician
and
perhaps
etruscan
sources
and
finally
by
conquest
everything
we
have
of
their
art
shows
their
imitation
of
grecian
models
their
embroideries
would
certainly
have
shown
the
same
impress
greece
herself
crushed
and
demoralized
even
as
late
as
the
eastern
empire
gave
to
rome
the
fashion
of
the
byzantine
taste
which
she

sad
to
mark
how
not

the
refinements
of
taste
but
even
the
guiding
principles
of
art
were
gradually
lost
in
the
humiliation
of
a

people
the
dulness
and
discouragement

weighed
down
by
roman
chains
it

and

in

late
roman
art
reminds
us
of
the
art
of
etruria
in
its
archaic
days
except
that
the
freshness
and
promise
are
wanting
and
that
the
one
was
in
its
first
the
other
its
second
childhood
before
entering
on
the
subject
of
christian
art
i
must
again
refer
however
briefly
to
the
eastern
origin
of
all
art
it
is
evident
that
this
had
always
flowed
in
streams
of
many
types
from
that
high
watershed
of
central
asia
where
our
human
race
is
said
to
have
been
created
and
whence
all
wisdom
and
knowledge
have
emanated
in
the
image
of
the
creator
man
issued
from
thence
endowed
with
the
gift
of
the
creative
power
wave
after
wave
of
fresh
and
apparently
differing
nationalities
followed
each
other
partially
submerging
those
that
had
gone
before
and
spreading
till
it
had
reached
the
furthest
shores
of
the
northern
seas
and
the
atlantic
and
encircled
the
mediterranean
they
all
followed
the
same
course
from
east
to
west
the
greek
civilization
was
indeed
so
dazzling
and
strong
that
it
lighted
the
world
all
around
and
india
persia
and
assyria
felt
its
influence
reflected
back
on
its
old
asian
cradle
but
from
the
same
high
watershed
flowed
other
tribal
types
towards
china
java
and
japan
that
had
no
affinity
with
any
western
civilization
and
while
the
assyrian
persian
indian
and
mongolian
styles
mixed
and
overlapped
so
near
their
sources
that
it
is
sometimes
hardly
possible
to
reason
out
and
classify
their
resemblances
and
their
differences
the
tribes
flowing
eastward
turned
aside
and
went
their
own
way
and
have
remained
till
now
perfectly
distinct
in
spite
of
their
matchless
dexterity
in
the
manipulation
of
their
materials
the
infinite
variety
of
their
stitches
and
exquisite
finish
in
execution
carrying
out
to
the
utmost
point
the
intended
effect
yet
chinese
and
japanese
textile
art
differs
in
its
inner
principles
from
all
our
accepted
canons
of
taste
so
that
their
want
of
harmony
and
sometimes
their
absurdity
is
a
puzzle
of
which
we
can
not
find
the
key
this
i
have
already
alluded
to
i
purposely
avoid
the
questions
suggested
by
chinese
art
the
immense
antiquity
it
claims
can
not
be
allowed
without
hesitation
terrien
de
la
couperie
however
believes
that
he
has
found
the
actual
point
of
departure
of
chinese
civilization
and
he
considers
it
to
be
an
early
offshoot
from
babylon
he
supports
his
theory
on
linguistic
grounds
and
we
must
anxiously
wait
to
see
if
it
is
corroborated
by
further
researches
into
the
earliest
records
of
the
archaic
chinese
literature
but
immobility
in
art
is
a
chinese
characteristic
and
no
national
cataclysms
seem
to
have
disturbed
it
the
oldest
specimens
known
are
very
like
the
most
modern
yet
an
adept
learned
in
chinese
art
can
detect
the
signs
which
mark
its
different
epochs
in
this
they
differ
from
the
japanese
who
added
to
their
inherited
exquisite
appreciation
of
natural
beauty
have
a
power
of
assimilation
that
might
lead
in
time
to
their
possessing
a
school
of
art
which
being
really
original
might
become
the
style
of
the
future
the
civilization
of
japan
is
not
older
than
the
fifth
century
and
was
probably
then
imported
from
corea
some
of
the
earliest
specimens
we
know
of
their
art
are
embroidered
religious
pictures
by
the
son
of
a
mikado
sholokutaiski
who
was
in
the
seventh
century
the
great
apostle
of
buddhism
in
japan
and
the
next
earliest
works
are
by
the
first
nun
honi
in
the
eighth
century
we
have
european
work
as
old
and
it
is
most
interesting
to
compare
the
differences
of
their
styles
and
stitches
we
must
now
return
to
the
beginning
of
our
era
when
we
find
greek
taste
such
as
it
was
still
influencing
and
colouring
art
in
italy
and
throughout
europe
asia
and
africa
wherever
roman
colonies
were
founded
till
the
eighth
century
it
died
hard
but
by
that
time
the
barbarians
had
poured
from
the
east
and
north
in
successive
waves
and
conquered
and
suppressed
the
classical
civilization
nothing
is
so
puzzling
in
textile
art
as
the
mixture
of
styles
during
the
first
years
the
the
byzantine
and
the
egyptian
crossed
by
the
arabian
persian
and
indian
styles
were
reproduced
in
the
sicilian
looms

stock
patterns
such
as
the
reclining
hares

fawns

we
find
them
on

supplemented
by
the

christian
art

began
in

formed
itself
into
the

in

overcame
the

luxury
was
born
in
babylon
and
persia
became
its
nurse
whence
all
its
glories
and
refinements
spread
over
the
world
but
if
luxury
was
babylonian
art
was
greek
alas
the
love
of

survived

we
may
date
the
commencement
of
ecclesiastical
art
it
was
a
new
birth
and
had
to
struggle
through
an
infancy
of
nearly
years
ignoring
or
unconscious
of
all
rules
of
drawing
colouring
and
design
outlines
filled
in
with
flat
surfaces
of

represented
again
the
art
of
painting
which
had
returned
to
archaic
types
and
in
no
way
differed
from
the
essential
properties
of
the
art
of
acu
pingere
or
needlework
which
was
in
the
same
phase
being
fortunately
for
it
that
to
which
it
was
best
suited
therefore
fine
works
of
art
were
then
executed
by
the
needle
of
which
a
very
few
survive

in
description
or

lasting

with

arts
which
till
the
twelfth
century
were
all
but
in
abeyance
in
discussing
textile
art
i
am
obliged
to
pass
over
a
part
of
the
dark
ages
and
to
approach
the
period
when
it
must
be
studied
chiefly
in
sicily
which
became
the
house
on
the
high
road
to
the
east
and
later
the
of
the
crusaders
to
and
from
the
holy
land
sicily
which
had
succeeded
to
constantinople
as
being
the
great

during
the
middle
ages
was
in
the
hands
of
the
moors
the
origin
and
source
of
all
european
gothic
textile
art
yet
even
at
palermo
and
messina
this
art
was
long
controlled
by
the
traditions
of
greece
ancient
and
modern
while
fertilized
by
persian
and
indian
forms
and
traditional
symbolisms
the
next
european
phase
was
the
gothic
this
was
arab
and
moresque
steeped
in
northern
ideas
and
finding
its
congenial
soil
it
grew
into
the
most
splendid
thoughtful
and
finished
style
far
transcending
anything
that
it
had
borrowed
from
eastern
or
southern
sources
all
its
traditions
were
carried
out
in
the
smaller
decorative

when
taste
was
imperfect
or
declined
then
the
decorations
were
all
rude
and
the
embroideries
shared
in
the
general
rudeness
or
poverty
but
as
these
crafts
rose
again
adding
to
themselves
grace
and
beauty
by
study
and
experience

for

to

italian
spanish

the

while

of

never
lost
their
excellence
and
still
hold
their
high
position
among
the
workers
of
golden
orphreys
in
italy
they
always
retained
much
of
the
classical
element
probably
the
ancient
frescoes
which
served
as
models
were
originally
painted
by
greek
artists
and
their
roman
imitators
this
style
flourished
for
a
hundred
years
the
french
adopted
and
modified
it
the
decorative
style
of
that
period
is
sometimes
called
the
arabesque
and
sometimes
the
grotesque
the
fashion
was
really
copied
from
the
excavated
palaces
and
tombs
of
the
best
roman
era
raphael
admired
and
caused
his
pupils
to
imitate
and
copy
them
and
they
influenced
all
decorative
art
for
a
considerable
period
as
long
as
beautiful
forms
of
flowers
fruit
birds
and
animals
were
adhered
to
the
arabesque
was
a
charming
decoration
gay
and
brilliant
but
when
the
beautiful
was
set
aside
and
the
ugly
ideas
were
reproduced
the
style
became
the
grotesque
which
word
only
means
the
grotto
cave
or
tomb
style
and
is
as
undescriptive
to
us
as
the
word
arabesque
which
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
arabs
or
their
arts
it
would
appear
that
if
the
beautiful
only
is
permissible
in
decorative
art
and
that
if
without
beauty
there
is
no
reason
that
it
should
exist
at
all
then
the
grotesque
should
not
be
allowed
except
as
a
scherzo
of
the
pencil
to
be
relegated
like
all
other
caricatures
to
the
portfolio
a
grotesque
is
something
startling
laughable
perhaps
ridiculous
a
woman
with
the
head
of
a
goose
and
a
flowery
tail
may
be
a
symbolical
but
it
never
can
be
an
agreeable
object
when
the
idea
conveyed
is
a
great
one
then
it
is
excusable
the
ninevite
bull
with
a
human
head
and
five
legs
is
a
grotesque
but
it
is
also
a
symbol
of
majesty
and
might
a
satyr
is
a
grotesque
but
he
has
been
so
long
recorded
and
accepted
that
he
has
ceased
to
surprise
us
and
the
greeks
spent
so
much
genius
in
making
him
a
graceful
creature
that
he
has
become
picturesque
if
not
beautiful
arabesques
and
grotesques
have
now
so
long
prevailed
in
decoration
that
we
have
ceased
to
criticize
them
on
principle
and
accept
them
gratefully
in
proportion
to
the
gay
fancy
and
reticent
genius
of
the
designer
most
arabesques
are
in
fact
only
graceful
nonsense

not
shock
us

they
are
more
safely
copied

the
renaissance
was
particularly
marked
in
spain
and
portugal
by
the
embroideries
which
the
latter
drew
from
their
indian
possessions
in
goa
whilst
we
in
england
were
sedulously
thrusting
from
our
shores
any
beautiful
indian
textiles
that
we
imagined
could
injure
our
own
home
manufactures
it
was
consequently
the
worst
phase
of
needlework
with
us
while
spanish
and
portuguese
embroideries
of
the
sixteenth

seventeenth
centuries
are
especially
fine
their
designs

oriental
their
renaissance
which
went
by

of
the

a
style
apart

the
reason
of

is
that
it
seems
to
have
been
originally
intended
for

is
best
suited
to
the
shapes
and
decorations
of
gold

it
is
extremely
rich
and
ornate
not
so
appropriate
to
architecture
as
to
the
smaller

wanting
perhaps
the
simplicity
which
gives
dignity

its
furniture
and
wall
decorations
dress
plate
and
books
shine
in
all
the
fertile
richness
and
grace
of
french
artistic
ingenuity
the
new
style
asserted
itself
everywhere
and
remodelled
every
art
but
the
long
reign
of
louis
quatorze
gave
the
fashion
time
to
wane
and
change
under
louis
xv
the
defects
increased
and
the
beauties
diminished
the
fine
heavy
borders
were
broken
up
into
fragmentary
forms
all
flow
and
strength
were
eliminated
and
what
remained
of
the
louis
quatorze
style
became
under
its
next
phase
only
remarkable
for
the
sparkling
prettiness
which
is
inherent
in
all
french
art
in
italy
this
very
ornate
style
was
distinguished
as
the
and
was
a
chastened
imitation
or
appropriation
of
the
spanish
plâteresque
and
the
french
louis
quatorze
in
germany
it
was
a
decided
heavy
copy
of
both
of
which
there
are
splendid
examples
in
the
adornment
of
the
german
palaces
royal
and
episcopal
in
england
the
continental
taste
was
faintly
reflected
during
the
reign
of
queen
anne
and
the
first
georges
but
except
in
the
characteristic
upholstery
of
the
chippendales
and
one
or
two
palaces
such
as
blenheim
and
castle
howard
we
did
not
produce
much
that
was
original
in
the
style
of
that
day
under
louis
boucher
and
watteau
in
france
produced
designs
that
were
well
suited
to
tapestries
and
embroideries
all
the
heathen
gods
with
cupids
garlands
floating
ribbons
crowns
and
cyphers
were
everywhere
carved
gilded
and
worked
it
was
the
visible
tide
of
the
frivolity
in
which
poor
marie
antoinette
was
drowned
though
before
the
revolution
she
had
somewhat
simplified
the
forms
of
decoration
and
straight
lines
instead
of
curves
and
delicacy
rather
than
splendour
had
superseded
at
least
at
court
the
extravagant
richness
of
palatial
furniture
this
was
followed
by
the
revolution
and
then
came
the
attempt
at
classical
severity
so
contrary
to
the
french
nature
which
the
republic
affected
dress
was
adorned
with
embroidered
spots
and
etruscan
borders
and
the
ladies
wore
diadems
and
tried
to
be
as
like
as
possible
to
the
greek
women
painted
in
fictile
art
napoleon
attempted
a
dress
which
was
supposed
to
be
roman
at
his
coronation
trophies
were
woven
and
embroidered
and
the
honeysuckle
key
and
egg
and
anchor
patterns
were
everywhere
with
the
fall
of
the
empire
the
classical
taste
collapsed
and
the
egyptian
greek
and
roman
furniture
were
handed
over
to
hotels
and
in
most
of
the
palaces
on
the
continent
an
apartment
is
still
to
be
seen
furnished
in
this
style
it
was
the
necessary
tribute
of
flattery
to
the
great
conqueror
who
in
that
character
inhabited
so
many
of
them
for
a
short
time
but
there
was
no
sign
of
the
style
being
taken
up
enthusiastically
anywhere
out
of
france
after
the
fall
of
the
empire
all
pretence
of
style
was
in
abeyance
and
it
was
then
gradually
replaced
by
a
general
craving
for
the
antique
the
rococo
and
finally
the
baroc
as
the
outcome
of
that
part
of
a
gentleman
education
called
the
grand
tour
every
one
bought
up
old
furniture
italy
and
spain
were
ransacked
and
foreign
works
of
all
ages
were
added
to
the
hereditary
house
furnishings
every
wealthy
home
became
a
museum
now
the
numerous
exhibitions
of
the
last
few
years
bringing
together
the
works
of
all
europe
and
other
continents
have
enabled
us
to
continue
to
collect
and
compare
and
furnish
without
any
reference
to
a
particular
style
meantime
young
england
had
become
æsthetic
bohemianism
was
the
fashion
and
the
studio
had
to
be
furnished
as
a
picturesque
lounge
ragged
tapestries
for
backgrounds
antique
chairs
and
bits
of
colour
as
cushions
and
draperies
shiny
earthenware
pots
to
hold
a
flower
and
to
catch
a
high
light
all
these
bridged
the
space
between
the
new
æstheticism
and
the
old
family
museums
and
from
their
combination
arose
the
style
called
by
courtesy
the
queen
anne
a
style
which
can
be
brought
within
the
reach
of
the
most
moderate
fortunes
in
humble
mansions
you
will
be
aware
of
the
grouping
of
the
old
pieces
of
furniture
culminating
perhaps
in
my
cabinet
and
her
portrait
by
hogarth
or
my
sword
and
pistols
which
he
carried
at
culloden
and
his
clock
a
relic
perhaps
of
the
scotch
dutch
the
english
style
of
is
really
a
conglomerate
of
the
preceding
two
hundred
years
and
it
is
formed
from
the
débris
of
our
family
life
it
belongs
mostly
to
the
period
of
the
pigtail
but
it
stretches
back
and
includes
all
that
followed
the
protectorate
and
is
therefore
coeval
with
the
wig
the
name
of
queen
anne
would
really
do
as
well
as
any
other
only
that
the
style
of
her
reign
which
was
heavy
louis
quatorze
is
looked
upon
with
suspicion
and
never
admitted
for
imitation
the
nineteenth
century
would
be
a
better
name
for
it
has
formed
itself
only
within
the
last
thirty
years
in
the
very
heart
of
the
century
and
is
in
fact
a
fortunate
result
of
preceding
conditions
it
owes
its
existence
as
i
have
said
partly
to
the
archæological
tendencies
of
the
day
the
maimed
tables
and
chairs
which
had
painfully
ascended
from
saloon
to
bedroom
nursery
and
attic
till
they
reposed
in
the
garret
the
bedlam
of
crazy
furniture
now
have
descended
in
all
the
prestige
of
antiquarian
and
family
interest
their
history
is
recorded
the
old
embroideries
are
restored
named
and
honoured
what
is
not
beautiful
is
credited
with
being
quaint
the
quaint
is
more
easily
imitated
than
the
beautiful
and
we
have
elected
this
for
the
characteristic
of
our
new
decorations
to
be
quaint
is
really
to
be
funny
without
intending
it
and
its
claim
to
prettiness
is
its
which
is
sometimes
touching
as
well
as
amusing
this
was
the
special
characteristic
of
the
revival
in
the
middle
ages
to
imitate
quaintness
must
be
a
mistake
in
art
as
in
life
it
is
absurd
to
imitate
innocence
the
nineteenth
century
queen
anne
has
its
merits
it
combines
simplicity
roominess
and
comfort
colour
light
and
shade
soft
colouring
to
harmonize
the
new
furniture
with
the
tender
tints
of
the
faded
quaintnesses
just
restored
to
society
care
in
grouping
even
the
commonest
objects
so
as
to
give
pleasure
to
the
eye
a
revived
taste
for
embroidered
instead
of
woven
materials
giving
scope
to
the
talents
of
the
women
of
the
house
all
these
are
so
much
gained
in
domestic
decoration
the
poorest
and
most
trivial
arrangements
are
striving
to
attain
to
a
something
artistic
and
agreeable
this
is
still
confined
to
the
educated
classes
but
as
good
and
bad
alike
have
to
begin
on
the
surface
and
gradually
filter
through
to
the
dregs
of
society
we
may
hope
that
the
women
who
wore
the
last
chignon
and
the
last
crinoline
may
yet
solace
their
sordid
lives
in
flowing
or
tight
woollen
garments
adorned
with
their
own
needlework
and
that
the
floor
of
the
cottage
or
humble
lodging
will
set
off
the
shining
brass
kettle
and
the
flower
in
a
brown
or
blue
pot
consciously
selected
with
a
view
to
the
picturesque
and
enjoyed
accordingly
from
what
we
know
it
would
seem
that
a
vital
change
in
a
national
style
is
never
produced
by
the
inspiration
of
one
individual
genius
or
great
original
inventor
it
invariably
evolves
itself
slowly
by
the
patient
persistent
efforts
of
generations
polishing
and
touching
up
the
same
motive
and
at
last
reaching
human
perfection
the
annihilation
of
a
style
is
oftenest
caused
by
war
passing
over
the
land
or
revolution
breaking
up
the
fountains
of
social
life
and
swamping
the
art
and
the
artist
but
another
cause
of
such
an
extinction
perhaps
the
saddest
is
that
having
reached
perfection
as
far
as
it
may
it
deteriorates
sickens
corrupts
and
finally
is
thrown
aside
superseded
hidden
and
overlapped
by
a
newer
fashion
and
the
worst
and
latest
effort
discredits
in
the
eyes
of
men
the
splendid
successes
that
preceded
its
fall
though
the
next
succeeding
phase
may
be
less
worthy
to
live
than
the
last
yet
carrying
with
it
the
freshness
of
a
new
spring
it
is
acceptable
for
the
time
being
the
moral
i
should
draw
from
this
is
that
you
can
not
force
style
you
may
prune
direct
and
polish
it
but
you
must
accept
that
of
your
day
and
only
in
accordance
with
that
taste
can
your
work
be
useful
not
accepting
it
idly
or
wearily
but
cheerfully
on
principle
seeking
to
raise
it
refusing
by
word
or
deed
to
truckle
to
the
false
the
base
or
the
lawless
in
your
art
or
to
act
against
the
acknowledged
canons
of
good
taste
not
for
a
moment
should
ambition
be
checked
but
it
should
always
be
accompanied
by
the
grace
of
modesty
to
the
young
decorator
or
artist
who
feels
the
glow
of
original
design
prompting
him
to
reject
old
lines
and
follow
his
own
new
and
perhaps
crude
ideas
a
few
words
of
warning
and
encouragement
also
may
be
of
use
in
art
as
in
poetry
we
may
recognize
the
psalmist
experience
my
heart
burned
within
me
and
at
the
last
i
spake
with
my
tongue
in
small
as
in
great
things
crude
ideas
should
not
be
brought
to
the
front
no
one
should
give
his
thoughts
to
the
world
till
his
heart
has
within
him
and
he
has
been
to
express
himself
another
wise
saying
read
yourself
full
and
then
write
yourself
empty
also
applies
to
art
knowledge
must
first
be
accumulated
before
you
can
originate
wait
till
your
experience
and
your
thoughts
insist
on
expression
then
subject
the
expressed
idea
to
cultivated
criticism
and
profit
by
the
opinion
you
would
respect
if
another
work
and
not
your
own
were
under
discussion
it
is
true
that
taste
is
surprisingly
various
some
will
dislike
your
design
because
its
style
is
a
reflection
of
the
gothic
another
may
be
objected
to
as
being
frivolously
and
brilliant
whereas
the
critic
likes
only
the
sober
and
the
dull
few
are
sufficiently
educated
to
appreciate
style
and
we
can
not
rule
our
own
by
anybody
opinion
but
we
can
generalize
and
find
something
that
shall
be
agreeable
to
all
something
approaching
to
a
golden
mean
the
artist
for
decoration
should
be
sensitively
alive
to
any
suggestion
from
the
style
of
that
which
he
is
to
adorn
remembering
the
antecedent
motives
of
its
form
its
history
and
its
date
he
should
try
to
make
his
new
work
harmonize
with
the
old
but
of
one
thing
he
may
be
certain
unless
he
absolutely
copies
an
old
design
his
own
will
carry
the
visible
and
unmistakable
stamp
of
his
day
even
while
suggesting
copies
this
difficulty
arises
how
can
a
perfect
facsimile
be
obtained
no
reproduction
is
ever
really
exact
unless
cast
off
by
the
hundred
stamped
or
printed
by
a
machine
it
has
been
said
that
the
translator
of
a
poem
adds
to
or
takes
from
the
original
that
which
he
has
or
has
not
of
the
same
poetical
power
and
in
art
the
copy
requires
the
same
qualities
to
guide
the
hand
that
transmits
the
original
motive
to
another
material
an
artist
usually
carries
out
his
own
ideas
from
the
first
sketch
blocked
out
on
the
canvas
or
scribbled
on
the
bit
of
waste
paper
to
the
last
finishing
touch
it
is
as
far
as
it
can
be
in
human
art
the
visible
transcript
of
his
own
thought
in
needlework
this
can
hardly
ever
be
the
designer
whether
he
be
dunstan
pollaiolo
torrigiano
or
walter
crane
only
executes
a
drawing
which
leaves
his
hands
for
good
and
is
translated
into
embroidery
by
the
patient
needlewoman
who
simply
fills
in
an
outline
ignorant
of
art
unappreciative
of
its
subtleties
and
incapable
of
giving
life
and
expression
even
when
she
is
aware
that
they
are
indicated
in
the
original
design
this
is
almost
always
the
case
but
there
are
exceptions
charlemagne
dalmatic
for
instance
shows
signs
of
having
been
either
the
work
of
the
artist
himself
or
else
carried
out

supervision

the

he

has
to
work
out
the
craft

mystery
the
inner
meaning
of
the
design
or
intention
the
designer
himself
is
subject
to
the
prejudices
called
the
taste
of
his
day
he
is
necessarily
under
the
influence
which
that
taste
has
imposed
upon
him
and
from
which
no
spontaneous
efforts
of
genius
can
entirely
emancipate
him
whether
he
is
conceiving
a
temple
for
the
worship
of
a
national
faith

the
edging
for
the

of
a
fair
votaress
or

he
can
not
avoid
the
force
of
tradition
and
of
custom
which
comes
from
afar
weighted
with
the
power
of
long
descent
and
which
crushes
individuality
unless
it
is
of
the
most
robust
nature
of
very
early
design
we
have
most
curious
and
mysterious
glimpses
the
cave
man
was

artist
the
few
scratches

a
bone
cleverly
showing
the
forms
of
a
dog
or
a
stag
a
whale
or
a
seal
nay
the
figure
of
a
man
have
enabled
us
to
ascertain
and
to
classify
the
palæolithic
cave
man
from
whom
his
less
civilized
successor
the
neolithic
man
may
be
distinguished
by
his
absence
of
all
animal
design
these
fragmentary
scraps
of
information
pieced
together
only
in
these
later
years
teach
us
the
value
of
very
small
facts
which
time
and
care
are
now
accumulating
and
which
being
the
remains
of
lives
and
nations
passed
away
still
serve
as
the
soil
in
which
history
can
be
fertilized
we
have
no
means
of
judging
whether
the
cave
man
was
an
artist
on
a
greater
or
more
advanced
scale
than
is
actually
shown
by
the
the
only
other
relic
of

it
is
evident
that
a

imitation
of

such
as
is
seen
in
these
graffiti
and
at
an
immense
distance
in
advance
of
them

the
earliest
known
egyptian
sculptures
preceded
all
conventional
art
some
of
the
earliest
portrait
statues
in
the
museum
at
boulac
exhibit
a
high
degree
of
naturalistic
design
before
it
became
subservient
to
the
expression
of
the
faith
of
the
people
as
soon
as
art
was
found
to
be
the
fittest
conveyance
of
symbolism
it
became
the
consecrated
medium
for
transmitting
language
thought
and
history
and
was
reduced
to
forms
in
which
it
was
contented
to
remain
petrified
for
many
centuries
entirely
foregoing
the
study
or
imitation
of
nature
it
recorded
customs
historical
events
and
religious
beliefs
receiving
from
the
last
the
impress
of
the
unchangeable
and
the
absolute
which
it
gave
to
the
other
subjects
on
which
it
touched
it
ceased
to
be
a
creative
art
if
it
had
ever
aspired
to
such
a
function
and
was
never
the
embodiment
of
individual
thought
this
phase
prevailed
under
different
manifestations
in
assyria
and
china
pictorial
art
had
in
fact
become
merely
the
nursing
mother
of
the
alphabet
guiding
its
first
steps
the
hieroglyphic
delineation
or
expression
of
thoughts
and
facts
in
egypt
the
change
from
the
first
period
of
actual
imitation
of
nature
was
succeeded
by
many
centuries
of
the
very
slowest
progress
renouf
speaks
however
of
the
astonishing
identity
that
is
visible
through
all
the
periods
of
egyptian
art
for
you
could
never
mistake
anything
egyptian
for
the
produce
of
any
other
country
this
identity
and
slow
movement
he
says
are
not
inconsistent
with
an
immense
amount
of
change
which
must
exist
if
there
is
any
real
life
in
fact
there
were
periods
of
relative
progress
repose
and
decay
and
every
age
had
its
peculiar
character
birch
lepsius
or
marriette
could
at
once
tell
you
the
age
of
a
statue
inscription
or
manuscript
by
the
characteristic
signs
which
actually
fix
the
date
design
unconsciously
has
a
slowly
altering
and
persistently
onward
movement
which
but
seldom
repeats
itself
it
is
one
of
the
most
remarkable
instances
of
evolution
but
it
also
has
its
cataclysms
however
we
may
account
for
them
of
which
the
greek
apotheosis
of
all
art
is
a
shining
example
and
the
total
disappearance
of
classical
influence
in
europe
before
the
renaissance
is
another
i
will
instance
one
prevailing
habit
of
egyptian
art
in
the
long
processional
subjects
and
in
individual
separate
figures
it
was
usual
to
draw
the
head
in
perfect
profile
the
body
facing
you
but
not
completely
a
sort
of
compromise
with
a
view
of
it
and
the
feet
following
each
other
on
the
same
line
as
the
profile
this
mode
of
representing
the
human
figure
was
only
effaced
gradually
by
the
introduction
of
greek
art
and
continued
to
be
the
conventional
and
decorative
method
even
in
the
latest
days
of
egyptian
art
and
it
is
curious
to
observe
that
in
the
dark
ages
european
design
fell
into
the
same
habit
we
can
not
imagine
that
this
distorted
way
of
drawing
the
human
figure
could
have
any
intentional
meaning
and
therefore
may
simply
believe
that
it
had
become
a
custom
and
that
when
art
has
so
stiffened
and
consolidated
itself
by
precedent
and
long
tradition
as
in
egypt
and
in
india
certain
errors
as
well
as
certain
truths
become
as
it
were
ingrained
into
it
plato
remarked
of
egyptian
art
that
the
pictures
and
statues
they
made
ten
thousand
years
ago
were
in
no
particular
better
than
those
they
make
now
one
day
however
the
greek
broke
away
from
the
ancient
bonds
of
custom
the
body
was
made
to
accompany
the
head
and
the
feet
followed
suit
but
the
strange
fact
remains
that
for
several
thousand
years
men
walked
in
profile
all
out
of
drawing
evidently
originality
was
not
in
much
estimation
among
the
egyptian
patrons
of
art
design
seemed
to
have
restricted
itself
to
effective
adaptations
in
a
few
permitted
forms
in
architecture
and
painting
and
the
illumination
of
the
papyrus
mss
egyptian
elasticity
of
design
found
some
scope
in
its
domestic
ornamentation

jewellery

hangings

especially
in
its
embroideries
for
dress
here
much
ingenuity
was
shown
and
the
patterns
on

and
the
ceilings
of
tombs
give
us
the
designs
which
semper
considers
as
having
been
originally
intended
for
textile
purposes
he
strains
to
a
point
to
which
i
can
hardly
follow
him
the
theory
that
all
decorations
were
originally
textile
except
such
as
proceeded
in
china
from
the
motive
though
i
willingly
accept
the
idea
that
textile
decoration
was
one
of
the
first
and
most
active
promoters
of
design
it
is
not
possible
for
us
to
trace
systematically
the
different
points
at
which
egyptian
and
asiatic
art
touch
but
we
can
see
that
they
were
always
acting
and
reacting
on
each
other
in
the
later
centuries
before
our
era
and
that
greece
profited
by
them
the
first
efforts
of
both
to
break
through
this
chrysalis
stage
resulted
in
the
early
greek
archaic
style
its
strongly
marked
muscular
humanity
reminds
one
of
all
the
conflicting
impressions
struggling
in
the
conception
of
the
great
artist
who
first
embodied
them
they
appear
to
be
breaking
out
from
the
trammels
of
egyptian
and
assyrian
styles
which
by
meeting
had
engendered
life
and
greek
art
was
the
child
of
their
union
then
art
having
shaken
off
symbolism
as
its
only
purpose
and
seeking
to
represent
the
forms
of
men
yet
possessed
by
a
guiding
spirit
first
sought
to
convey
the
idea
of
expression
the
worship
of
humanity
mingling
with
that
of
their
gods
produced
the
heroic
ideal
and
all
the
attributes
of
their
heroes
majesty
beauty
grace
and
passion
had
to
be
depicted
as
well
as
rage
sorrow
despair
and
revenge
these
were
soon
to
be
surrounded
with
all
the
splendours
of
the
arts
of
decoration
greece
had
prepared
for
this
outburst
of
excellence
and
the
perfect
science
of
art
by
collecting
the
traditions
the
symbols
the
experience
in
colouring
and
the
knowledge
of
beautiful
forms
human
and
ideal
all
that
was
needed
for
the
advent
of
the
man
who
could
design
and
create
types
of
beauty
for
all
ages
was
thus
accumulated
and
the
man
came
and
his
name
was
pheidias
a
crowd
followed
him
all
steeped
in
the
same
flood
of
poetry
and
art
and
for
several
centuries
they
filled
the
world
with
the
sense
and
science
of
beauty
then
the
function
of
the
designer
the
artist
was
changed
and
elevated
and
he
became
through
the
great
days
of
greek
and
roman
pagan
art
and
afterwards
through
the
rise
of
that
of
christianity
the
exponent
of
all
that
was
poetical
and
ennobling
in
the
life
of
man
but
though
the
greek
artist
had
broken
the
chains
of
prescribed
form
he
still
adhered
to
the
motive
the
inner
symbolical
thought
and
strove
to
express
it
as
it
had
never
been
expressed
before
new
principles
were
evoked
and
the
artist
while
revelling
in
the
sweetness
and
light
of
freedom
framed
for
himself
standards
of
taste
and
refinement
which
he
left
as
a
heritage
to
all
succeeding
generations
i
fear
that
i
am
repeating
a
platitude
when
insisting
that
freedom
in
all
design
but
especially
that
employed
in
decoration
must
be
kept
within
certain
boundaries
otherwise
it
becomes
lawless
rules
like
all
other
controlling
circumstances
are
of
the
greatest
service
to
the
artist
as
they
suggest
what
he
can
do
as
well
as
decide
what
he
ought
not
to
attempt
all
boundaries
are
highly
suggestive
the
size
of
a
sheet
of
paper
the
form
of
a
panel
the
colours
in
the
box
of
pigments
even
the
touch
of
the
brush
which
comes
to
hand
all
these
help
to
shape
the
idea
to
our
ends
and
assist
us
in
giving
to
the
original
motive
the
form
which
is
most
suitable
these
restrictions
are
often
regarded
as
impediments
by
the
impatient
artist
whereas
he
ought
to
look
on
them
as
hints
and
suggestions
and
claim
their
assistance
instead
of
struggling
against
them
let
us
accept
the
principle
that
it
is
good
for
each
of
our
efforts
at
decoration
that
we
are
controlled
by
the
space
allotted
to
its
composition
the
relative
size
small
perhaps
for
a
but
large
for
that
of
a
book
and
the
shape
to
which
we
are
limited
alter
all
the
conditions
of
a
design
whether
it
is
square
or
oblong
or
lengthened
into
a
frieze
whether
it
must
be
divided
into
parts
including
more
than
one
motive
or
be
grouped
round
one
centre
whether
it
is
to
be
repeated
more
than
once
within
the
range
of
the
eye
or
whether
it
is
to
disappear
into
space
upwards
or
horizontally
and
whether
it
is
to
stand
alone
or
be
framed
with
lines
or
a
border
all
these
restrictions
must
govern
the
design
or
in
its
highest
phase
the
composition
the
composition
must
consist
of
supporting
lines
well
balanced
and
values
filling
up
the
whole
surface
of
the
space
which
is
to
contain
it
and
beyond
which
it
must
not
seek
to
extend
as
we
have
in
embroidery
no
distances
only
a
foreground
the
design
must
be
placed
all
on
one
plane
the
title
of
composition
can
not
be
granted
to
a
bouquet
or
a
bird
cast
on
one
corner
of
a
square
of
linen
however
gracefully
it
may
be
drawn
it
does
not
cover
the
space
allotted
to
it
if
we
carefully
study
the
great
and
guiding
principles
that
have
been
distinctly
formulated
by
some
of
the
continental
authorities
on
decorative
art
we
shall
find
much
help
in
composing
our
designs
nothing
is
more
interesting
than
to
search
for
the
foundation
of
the
structure
which
centuries
have
helped
to
raise
and
to
dig
out
as
it
were
the
original
plan
or
thought
of
the
founder
so
it
is
most
instructive
to
learn
the
fundamental
rules
by
which
such
results
are
secured
blanc
says
of
the
general
laws
of
ornamentation
there
can
be
no
nobler
satisfaction
to
the
mind
than
to
be
able
to
unravel
what
is
beyond
measure
complicated
to
diminish
what
is
apparently
immense
and
to
reduce
to
a
few
clear
points
what
has
been
till
now
involved
in
a
haze
of
obscurity
just
as
the
letters
of
the
alphabet
have
been
and
always
will
be
sufficient
to
form
the
expression
of
the
words
necessary
for
all
human
thought
so
certain
elements
susceptible
of
combination
among
themselves
have
sufficed
and
will
suffice
to
create
ornament
whose
variety
may
be
indefinitely
multiplied
he
reduces
ornamental
design
to
five
principles
repetition
alternation
symmetry
progression
and
confusion
illustration
fig
wave
pattern
first
repetition
you
may
act
on
the
mind
through
sight
by
the
same
means
as
those
that
will
excite
physical
sensations
a
single
prick
of
a
pin
is
nothing
but
a
hundred
such
will
be
intolerably
painful
repetition
produces
pleasurable
sensations
as
well
as
painful
ones
an
insignificant
form
can
become
interesting
by
repetition
and
by
the
suggestion
which
singly
it
could
not
originate
for
example
the
rolling
of
the
greek
scroll
or
wave
pattern
awakens
in
us
the
idea
of
one
object
following
another
it
also
suggests
the
waves
of
the
ocean
or
the
poet
may
see
in
it
a
troop
of
maidens
pursuing
each
other
in
space
not
frivolously
but
in
cadence
as
if
executing
a
mystic
dance
change
the
curves
into
angular
forms
as
making
the
key
pattern
and
it
will
no
longer
flow
but
become
as
severe
as
the
other
was
graceful
no
principle
gives
greater
pleasure
than
repetition
and
next
to
it
illustration
fig
key
pattern
variety
is
here
added
to
the
law
of
repetition
there
can
be
repetition
without
alternation
but
no
alternation
without
repetition
alternation
is
then
a
succession
of
two
objects
recurring
regularly
in
turn
and
the
cadence
of
appearance
and
disappearance
gives
pleasure
to
the
senses
whether
it
be
addressed
to
taste
hearing
or
sight
alternate
rhymes
and
even
short
and
long
lines
soothe
the
ear
in
verse
in
form
the
alternations
are
the
more
agreeable
the
more
they
differ
such
are
in
architecture
a
succession
of
metopes
and
triglyphs
on
a
doric
frieze
where
the
circle
and
the
straight
lines
relieve
each
other
illustration
fig
metopes
and
triglyphs
symmetry
the
correspondence
of
two
parts
opposite
to
each
other
is
symmetrical
a
living
being
man
or
animal
is
composed
of
two
parts
which
appear
to
have
been
united
down
one
central
line
without
being
identical
if
you
folded
them
down
the
line
they
would
overlap
and
perfectly
cover
each
other
man
is
born
with
the
sense
of
symmetry
to
match
his
outward
form
and
he
appreciates
its
existence
and
instinctively
feels
the
want
of
it
symmetry
is
another
word
for
justness
of
proportion
the
greeks
understood
by
symmetry
the
condition
of
a
body
of
which
the
members
have
a
common
measure
among
themselves
we
expect
the
two
sides
of
a
living
being
to
correspond
and
we
look
for
these
proportions
in
the
living
body
to
balance
each
other
which
we
do
not
expect
to
find
in
any
other
natural
object
a
large
leaf
at
the
end
of
a
slender
stem
may
be
as
appropriate
and
give
as
much
pleasure
as
a
small
leaf
in
the
same
position
but
a
huge
hand
at
the
end
of
an
arm
is
not
so
agreeable
to
our
sense
of
symmetry
as
one
of
the
size
and
outline
which
we
naturally
expect
to
see
the
mind
of
man
expects
to
find
outside
of
himself
and
his
own
proportions
something
which
he
feels
is
proportionate
and
symmetrical
in
fact
he
at
once
detects
the
want
of
it
the
japanese
with
delicacy
and
taste
often
substitute
for
symmetry
its
corollary
balance
the
chinese
or
japanese
vase
will
often
have
an
appreciable
affinity
and
resemblance
to
a
greek
one
each
preserving
a
secret
balance
even
in
the
extremest
whimsicality
of
its
composition
proportion
is
another
corollary
to
symmetry
if
it
is
not
another
word
for
some
of
its
qualities
progression
in
this
principle
are
included
long
perspectives
pyramidal
forms
in
architecture
and
certain
processional
compositions
for
pyramidal
surfaces
such
as
pediments
a
progressive
ornament
is
the
fittest
all
the
buildings
in
the
east
and
in
the
ancient
cities
of
central
america
which
are
raised
on
pyramids
of
steps
show
the
tendency
to
this
species
of
effect
in
giving
dignity
to
the
buildings
placed
on
such
platforms
perspectives
are
highly
attractive
specimens
of
progression
which
when
made
use
of
in
the
decorations
of
a
theatre
produce
delightful
illusions
blanc
quotes
bernardin
de
pierre
who
says
when
the
branches
of
a
plant
are
disposed
in
a
uniform
plan
of
diminishing
size
as
in
the
pyramidal
shape
of
a
pine
there
is
progression
and
if
these
trees
be
planted
in
long
avenues
diminishing
in
height
and
colour
as
each
tree
does
in
itself
our
pleasure
is
redoubled
because
progression
here
becomes
infinite
it
is
owing
to
this
feeling
of
infinity
that
we
take
pleasure
in
looking
at
anything
that
presents
progression
such
as
nurseries
in
different
stages
of
growth
the
slopes
of
hills
retreating
to
the
horizon
at
different
levels
interminable
perspectives
all
floral
compositions
which
give
the
effect
or
impression
of
growth
may
be
included
in
the
progressive
principle
a
composition
which
beginning
as
it
were
with
a
stem
spreads
and
floreates
equally
on
each
side
thrusting
outwards
and
upwards
and
ending
in
a
topmost
twig
or
bud
is
governed
by
this
principle
confusion
boileau
is
quoted
by
blanc
as
saying
a
fine
disorder
is
often
the
effect
of
art
and
he
adds
but
before
he
said
it
nature
had
shown
it
here
we
must
observe
that
the
confusions
or
disorders
of
nature
are
all
subject
to
certain
laws
and
it
is
in
adopting
this
idea
that
an
artistic
confusion
may
give
us
the
sense
of
its
being
ordered
by
and
subject
to
definite
rules
these
rules
act
as
the
frame
affects
the
picture
circumscribing
its
irregularities
and
restricting
them
to
a
certain
area
the
is
in
a
small
space
permitted
to
employ
confusion
because
the
art
of
the
will
keep
the
geometrical
effect
in
view
when
the
japanese
throw
their
ornaments
apparently
without
rule
here
and
there
on
the
japanned
box
they
reckon
on
the
square
shape
being
sufficiently
marked
to
the
eye
by
its
shining
surface
and
sharp
corners
the
confusion
in
a
japanese
landscape
is
so
beautiful
that
one
appreciates
the
innate
sense
of
balance
which
modifies
the
confusion
rules
and
orders
it
in
the
hands
of
the
designer
confusion
is
only
a
method
of
rendering
order
visible
in
a
happy
disorder
here
contraries
meet
and
touch
admit
these
as
the
principles
of
all
decoration
and
you
will
find
that
by
following
and
combining
them
you
may
produce
varieties
as
numberless
as
the
sands
of
the
sea
and
that
a
latent
equilibrium
will
reduce
nearly
every
complication
and
confusion
to
perfect
harmony
each
of
the
five
principles
we
have
discussed
has
its
corollary
which
adds
to
the
resources
of
the
decorative
artist
these
are
as
follows
to
repetition
belongs
harmony
or
consonance
to
alternation
contrast
to
symmetry
radiation
to
progression
gradation
to
balanced
confusion
deliberate
complication
in
form
and
in
colour
are
produced
in
different
ways
sometimes
by
repetition
with
variation
sometimes
by
the
different
parts
being
rather
reflected
on
each
than
repeated
this
explains
the
harmony
that
may
be
called
consonance
if
i
rightly
understand
blanc
theory
is
most
generally
understood
as
a
common
resource
in
the
hands
of
the
artist
for
producing
strong
effects
but
blanc
cleverly
expresses
the
reticence
needed
to
ensure
contrast
being
pleasurable
not
painful
to
adorn
persons
or
things
he
says
is
not
simply
for
the
purpose
of
causing
them
to
be
conspicuous
it
is
that
they
may
be
admired
it
is
not
simply
to
draw
attention
to
them
but
that
they
may
be
regarded
with
feelings
of
pleasure
if
contrast
be
needed
let
it
be
used
as
the
means
of
rendering
the
whole
more
powerful
brilliant
and
striking
for
instance
if
orange
is
intended
to
predominate
in
a
decoration
let
blue
be
mingled
with
it
but
sparingly
let
the
complementary
colour
be
its
auxiliary
and
not
its
rival
contrasts
are
always
unpleasant
if
the
two
forces
struggle
with
each
other
for
whether
it
be
in
form
or
in
colour
the
rule
to
be
observed
in
all
ornamental
design
is
this
that
contrasting
objects
instead
of
disturbing
unity
should
assist
it
by
giving
most
effect
to
that
we
wish
to
bring
forward
and
display
belongs
to
the
principle
of
symmetry
starting
from
a
centre
from
which
all
lines
diverge
and
to
which
all
lines
point
this
is
to
be
found
throughout
nature
from
the
rays
of
the
sun
to
the
petals
of
the
daisy
all
decorative
art
employs
and
illustrates
it
in
colour
as
in
form
is
not
quite
synonymous
with
progression
but
expresses
a
series
of
adroitly
managed
transitions
the
english
intermingle
in
their
decoration
colours
very
finely
blended
nor
do
they
find
any
transition
too
delicate
this
as
in
all
principles
of
ornament
has
to
be
employed
according
to
the
feelings
intended
to
be
produced
on
the
mind
of
the
spectator
whether
for
absolute
contrast
or
for
imperceptible
progression
when
the
tenderest
colours
are
needed
is
illustrated
by
blanc
by
a
quotation
from
ziegler
complication
is
another
aspect
of
the
art
which
owns
the
same
sentiment
as
that
expressed
by
dædalus
in
his
labyrinth
solomon
in
his
mysterious
seal
the
greeks
in
their
interlacing
and
winding
ornaments
the
byzantines
the
moors
and
the
architects
of
our
cathedrals
in
their
finest
works
intertwined
mosaics
and
intersection
of
arches
and
ribs
all
spring
from
complication
to
follow
the
interlacing
line
of
an
ornament
gives
the
mind
the
pleasure
of
untying
the
gordian
knot
without
cutting
it
it
gives
the
excitement
of
curiosity
pursuit
and
discovery
when
we
see
these
traceries
so
skilfully
plaited
in
which
straight
lines
and
curves
intermingle
cross
branch
out
disappear
and
recur
we
experience
a
high
pleasure
in
unravelling
a
puzzle
which
at
first
perhaps
appeared
to
be
undecipherable
and
in
acknowledging
that
a
latent
arrangement
may
be
recognized
in
what
at
first
and
at
a
distance
seems
an
inextricable
confusion
the
celtic
moorish
and
gothic
styles
illustrate
and
are
explained
by
these
remarks
and
they
are
well
worthy
the
attention
of
the
designer
having
so
freely
borrowed
from
blanc
chapter
on
the
general
laws
of
ornamentation
i
will
finish
my
quotations
with
the
words
with
which
he
concludes
there
is
no
decoration
in
the
works
of

or
the
inventions
of
men
which
does
not
owe
its
birth
to
one
of
the
original

here
enumerated
viz
repetition
alternation

progression

else
to
one
of

secondary

consonance

to

combination
of
these
different
elements
which
all
finally
lose
themselves
in
a
primordial
cause
the
origin
of
the
movements
of
the
universe
order
the
extracts
from
blanc
works
i
have
carefully
placed
between
commas
being
most
anxious
to
express
my
obligation
to
him
for
his
carefully
formulated
epitome
of
the
laws
of
design
but
though
i
have
largely
quoted
there
remains
still
much
most
interesting
and
suggestive
matter
which
i
recommend
the
reader
to
seek
in
his
book
though
we
should
call
to
our
aid
the
general
laws
of
design
for
all
art
we
must
select
from
them
what
is
specially
appropriate
for
the
needs
of
our
craft
from
the
art
of
needlework
we
should
eliminate
as
much
as
possible
all
ideas
of
all
variety
of
surface
and
effects
of
light
and
shadow
and
contrasting
colours
unity
softness
grace
refinement
brightness
cheerfulness
pleasant
suggestions
these
should
be
the
objects
in
view
when
we
design
the
panels
for
the
or
boudoir
the
hangings
for
the
bed
or
the
cover
for
the
table
harmony
which
will
satisfy
the
eye
thoughts
that
shall
please
the
mind
the
objects
in
nature
that
give
us
the
most
unalloyed
pleasure
birds
and
flowers
are
those
that
from
all
time
have
served
as
the
materials
for
decorative
design
and
therefore
have
been
moulded
into
the
traditional
patterns
which
have
descended
to
us
from
the
earliest
times
design
must
follow
the
scientific
laws
of
art
and
shape
the
variations
of
traditional
forms
from
which
we
can
not
escape
in
our
present
search
after
these
inner
truths
i
repeat
that
we
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
rules
of
painting
sculpture
and
architecture
or
any
other
of
the
secondary
arts
such
as
wood
carving
metal
work
these
having
each
their
own
intrinsic
principles
which
must
be
worked
out
as
corollaries
from
the
general
laws
of
composition
which
govern
all
aryan
art
it
is
curious
that
in
drawing
on
the
flat
in
ancient
frescoes
there
appear
to
be
no
acknowledged
rules
of
perspective
hardly
more
in
pompeii
than
on
early
chinese
screens
and
plates
or
than
later
in
the
bayeux
tapestries
and
yet
the
greeks
with
their
unerring
instinct
actually
made
use
of
false
architectural
perspectives
to
add
to
the
effects
of
height
and
depth
in
their
colonnaded
buildings
they
sensibly
diminished
the
circumference
of
the
columns
and
used
other
means
in
their
designs
for
this
purpose
they
understood
the
principle
but
they
did
not
carry
it
into
flat
decorative
art
they
did
not
attempt
when
they
painted
a
landscape
on
the
wall
to
do
more
than
recall
the
idea
they
were
sketching
and
never
thought
of
vying
in
scientific
or
naturalistic
imitation
with
the
real
landscape
they
saw
through
the
window
they
did
not
wish
to
interfere
with
the
effect
of
the
statue
or
the
human
figures
grouped
in
front
of
it
to
which
the
wall
served
as
a
background
those
threw
shadows
and
cast
lights
but
in
the
flat
there
were
no
shadows
no
perspective
all
was
flat
we
must
draw
from
this
the
deduction
that
the
greeks
held
that
flatness
was
an
essential
quality
of
wall
decoration
except
in
friezes
as
well
as
of
all
textile
ornament
and
for
every
reason
we
must
accept
this
flatness
as
a
general
law
for
designs
in
embroidery
in
hangings
and
dress
materials
flatness
is
more
agreeable
than
a
complicated
shaded
design
especially
when
it
is
further
confused
by
folds
disturbing
and
interrupting
the
flow
of
the
lines
of
the
pattern
the
reader
will
perceive
that
the
laws
of
composition
for
textiles
quoted
from
blanc
apply
perfectly
to
designs
on
the
flat
and
to
outlined
sketches
in
black
and
white
as
well
as
to
the
most
elaborate
compositions
for
pictures
either
historical
or
genre
they
are
rules
which
should
be
understood
and
employed
by
the
man
who
draws
for
a
or
an
area
railing
and
certainly
by
him
who
makes
patterns
for
our
schools
of
design
it
may
therefore
be
laid
down
as
a
general
rule
that
all
designs
for
embroidery
should
be
considered
first
as
outlined
drawings
covering
a
flat
surface
and
then
filled
in
with
colour
the
outlines
should
as
little
as
possible
overlap
one
another
as
flatness
is
one
of
the
first
objects
to
be
remembered
and
this
of
course
will
be
disturbed
by
the
parts
passing
over
or
under
each
other
indian
designs
in
flowers
have
invariably
a
wonderful
flatness
in
the
absence
of
all
light
and
shadow
joined
to
a
naturalistic
suggestion
of
detail
which
is
accounted
for
by
their
traditional
mode
of
copying
from
nature
the
branch
or
blossom
to
be
copied
is
laid
on
the
ground
and
pegged
down
with
care
to
eliminate
every
variety
of
surface
and
every
branch
and
twig
so
arranged
that
they
may
not
cross
or
touch
each
other
this
conventional
composition
is
then
drawn
and
every
natural
distinction
in
the
form
carefully
copied
i
would
suggest
that
this
idea
should
be
accepted
as
useful
for
imitation
among
ourselves
in
certain
conventional
compositions
of
vegetable
forms
perhaps
it
is
our
aryan
ancestry
that
has
given
us
a
prevailing
taste
for
such
decorations
and
it
is
worth
while
to
consider
how
best
to
manipulate
them
clinging
as
we
do
to
these
floral
designs
we
can
see
that
they
are
the
only
ones
that
bear
repetition
whether
covering
the
surface
of
the
material
in
the
rich
irregularity
of
the
flowers
in
a
field
or
conventionalized
into
a
form
or
a
pattern
the
eye
is
never
shocked
or
fatigued
by
such
repetitions
in
orderly
confusion
or
trained
by
the
hand
into
artistic
shapes
or
meanderings
of
tracery
but
when
embroidery
or
weaving
attempts
to
represent
animals
or
typical
human
figures
repetition
immediately
becomes
tiresome
a
madonna
surrounded
by
angels
comes
in
badly
repeated
over
and
over
again
as
a
pattern
broken
up
by
folds
cut
up
by
a
seam
dislocated
in
the
joining
and
repeated
in
tiers
such
a
design
is
figured
in
auberville
book
the
drawing
is
beautiful
but
by
repetition
it
becomes
ridiculous
i
therefore
deprecate
this
kind
of
ornament
in
textile
work
for
this
reason
embroidery
which
can
be
fitted
to
each
space
that
is
to
be
covered
is
preferable
to
woven
designs
however
richly
or
perfectly
they
may
be
carried
out
another
class
of
design
which
must
be
considered
apart
is
the
of
which
the
special
distinction
appears
to
be
that
it
consists
of
echoes
or
fragments
of
what
we
have
seen
elsewhere
these
conventional
patterns
are
often
merely
the
of
past
styles
or
motives
crushed
and
placed
by
time
in
a
sort
of
kaleidoscope
they
remind
one
of
the
little
wreaths
of
broken
shells
and
coloured
left
on
the
sands
by
the
retiring
waves
after
a
storm
and
are
sometimes
full
of
beauty
and
suggestion
pl
we
trace
in
these
fragmentary
patterns
forgotten
links
with
different
civilizations
and
we
ponder
on
the
historical
events
which
have
brought
them
into
juxtaposition
these
kaleidoscope
patterns
are
to
be
seen
in
persian
and
turkish
carpets
of
the
present
day
and
we
find
on
examination
little
bits
which
can
only
be
the
remnants
of
a
motive
probably
as
much
lost
now
to
the
designer
who
inherits
the
traditional
form
as
to
us
who
can
only
see
the
vague
results
i
illustrate
this
remark
by
giving
the
border
of
a
modern
persian
carpet
which
has
certainly
had
egyptian
ancestry
the
boat
the
beetle
and
the
prehistoric
cross
are
to
be
found
in
it
illustration
fig
persian
carpet
many
conventional
patterns
of
are
descendants
of
the
of
chinese
art
and
of
the
zigzags
lines
and
discs
of
barbarous
primitive
ornamentation
the
traceries
in
indian
stone
windows
show
some
of
the
most
charming
geometrical
forms
and
are
akin
to
the
persian
and
russian
modes
of
composing
conventional
patterns
they
appear
on
very
ancient
metal
work
and
are
the
motives
of
all
the
embroideries
in
the
greek
islands
and
the
principalities
and
of
the
linen
embroideries
of
russia
their
byzantine
origin
gave
its
impress
to
the
european
schools
of
the
middle
ages
and
the
of
germany
and
venice
of
the
sixteenth
century
are
full
of
them
they
are
best
suited
for
the
mosaic
stitches
and
kept
in
their
places
as
decoration
they
are
useful
for
carpets
and
borders
it
should
be
impressed
on
our
young
artists
that
in
composing
their
designs
they
must
be
influenced
by
the
materials
to
be
employed
and
the
purpose
for
which
the
decoration
is
intended
thus
in
textile
design
for
dress
and
hangings
excepting
for
tapestries
the
fact
must
never
be
lost
sight
of
that
they
will
be
subject
to
disturbance
by
crossing
folds
and
crumplings
which
will
break
up
the
lines
of
the
pattern
it
is
therefore
evident
that
a
design
fitted
for
a
rigid
material
in
a
fixed
place
such
as
an
architectural
decoration
in
wood
stone
or
stucco
must
be
subject
to
a
treatment
different
from
that
which
befits
an
embroidered
curtain
or
panel
stone
and
wood
being
materials
of
uniform
colour
require
all
the
help
of
recessed
shadows
and
projections
to
catch
the
light
whereas
in
textiles
form
is
assisted
by
colour
and
smoothness
of
surface
is
a
primary
consideration
the
strongly
accentuated
design
for
becomes
poor
and
lifeless
when
deprived
of
its
essential
conditions
and
and
the
pattern
which
looks
charming
outlined
and
filled
in
with
colour
could
be
hardly
seen
incised
on
a
flat
stone
surface
this
seems
a
truism
but
the
neglect
of
these
plain
axioms
causes
many
mistakes
in
decorative
art
redgrave
says
a
design
must
be
bad
which
applies
the
same
treatment
to
different
materials
he
further
says
the
position
of
the
ornament
requires
special
consideration
the
varied
quantities
bolder
relief
and
coarser
execution
are
not
only
allowable
but
absolutely
necessary
at
heights
considerably
above
the
eye
moreover
each
fabric
has
its
own
peculiar
lustre
texture
thus
in
the
use
of
hangings
curtains
the
design
might
be
suitable
in
silk
and
coarse
or
dull
in
woollen
here
i
venture
to
differ
from
redgrave
perspective
is
as
much
to
be
respected
in
decoration
as
in
pictures
near
to
the
eye
and
the
gradation
in
size
and
colour
as
the
ornament
travels
up
into
height
or
fades
into
distance
is
a
phase
of
pleasure
which
should
not
be
checked
by
enlargement
of
form
or
reinforcement
of
colouring
it
is
hardly
necessary
to
warn
our
artists
against
a
sort
of
design
which
is
conventional
yet
had
its
own
meaning
in
the
beginning
this
is
to
be
found
in
indian
carvings
and
embroideries
of
a
certain
date
or
imitating
the
works
of
that
distant
period
it
proceeded
from
a
hideous
worship
of
monstrous
dravidian
divinities
their
statues
are
to
be
found
surrounded
by
coarsely
designed
patterns
in
the
temple
architecture
of
the
first
and
second
centuries
its
characteristics
are
idols
in
niches
or
shrines
distorted
in
form
or
attitude
foliage
of
unnatural
twisted
plants
added
to
the
recurring
of
the
lotus
and
tree
of
life
or
animals
destroying
each
other
or
kneeling
in
worship
to
the
idols
these
ugly
designs
are
purely
conventional
fergusson
suggests
that
they
were
introduced
into
mexico
in
the
fourth
or
fifth
centuries
by
buddhism
those
sometimes
divinities
drove
out
the
beautiful
aryan
types
which
however
resumed
their
sway
when
the
wave
of
the
renaissance
flowed
back
to
india
and
was
remodelled
by
oriental
taste
to
the
lovely
designs
we
find
in
the
taj
mahal
in
blanc
classification
of
ornament
he
has
placed
gothic
design
under
the
head
of
deliberate
complication
the
whole
of
the
gothic
decorations
which
are
a
gradual
growth
in
one
direction
arose
from
the
study
of
interlacing
boughs
and
stems
employed
as
the
enrichment
of
the
forms
of
the
vaulted
roofs
the
possibilities
of
great
size
and
height
covered
these
designs
and
inspired
all
their
decoration
and
the
effect
of
reiteration
and
long
recurring
lines
in
perspective
was
essentially
the
motive
of
these
avenues
in
stone
here
enter
the
principles
of
repetition
and
progression
and
you
will
find
how
carefully
the
designers
of
the
twelfth
thirteenth
and
fourteenth
centuries
worked
up
to
these
ideas
you
will
see
in
their
embroideries
shining
figures
or
pictures
in
gold
silver
and
coloured
silks
shimmering
on
dark
velvet
backgrounds
each
design
terminating
a
perspective
of
architectural
forms
which
enhances
their
brilliancy
the
most
effective
probably
were
generally
employed
for
the
adornment
of
the
high
altar
so
as
to
be
seen
from
a
great
distance
the
smaller
and
less
distinct
and
more
delicate
ornaments
were
reserved
for
the
side
chapels
or
for
smaller
churches
where
such
distant
effects
were
inappropriate
but
the
motives
of
ecclesiastical
embroidery
will
be
discussed
in
a
future
chapter
all
attempts
at
pictorial
art
are
a
mistake
in
textiles
it
does
not
enter
into
such
designs
and
when
by
chance
it
is
allowed
to
be
so
used
it
is
an
error
of
judgment
and
only
exhibits
a
laborious
and
useless
ingenuity
it
is
no
longer
an
artistic
delineation
of
a
natural
object
but
becomes
an
imitation
of
another
way
of
rendering
such
objects
redgrave
says
that
pictorial
art
in
our
manufactures
is
one
of
our
great
mistakes
the
picture
must
be
independent
of
the
material
the
thought
alone
should
govern
it
whereas
in
decoration
the
material
must
be
one
of
the
suggestors
of
the
thought
its
use
must
govern
the
design
perhaps
it
will
appear
to
my
readers
that
here
i
repeat
in
different
forms
what
has
been
said
in
a
previous
chapter
on
the
history
of
style
i
think
that
it
is
better
to
do
so
than
to
omit
to
show
where
style
and
design
must
accompany
each
other
style
without
any
reference
to
design
would
be
but
a
barren
subject
and
design
without
reference
to
style
would
become
lawless
and
soon
be
lost
in
the
mazes
of
bad
taste
and
mannerism
both
subjects
are
of
so
large
and
important
a
nature
that
i
do
not
attempt
to
do
more
than
point
out
how
in
their
history
and
their
influence
they
belong
to
the
craft
of
embroidery
such
influences
belong
to
all
art
and
though
i
am
anxious
to
confine
myself
to
only
one
section
of
it
i
find
it
difficult
to
resist
the
temptation
to
generalize
and
stray
from
the
prescribed
path
when
large
and
important
views
are
opened
on
every
side
as
i
travel
on
from
point
to
point
in
sketching
the
history
of
design
as
well
as
i
may
in
so
short
a
space
it
is
only
considered
in
the
light
in
which
it
illustrates
our
craft
i
repeat
that
the
design
should
be
informed
by
the
motive
which
suggested
it
and
by
the
need
which
has
called
it
forth
and
it
must
be
moulded
to
the
space
it
has
to
fill
and
the
position
it
will
occupy
the
design
must
be
modified
into
different
outward
forms
according
to
whether
it
is
to
be
fitted
to
the
edge
of
a
building
against
the
sky
to
a
high
panelled
wall
to
be
applied
as
a
frieze
or
round
the
capital
of
a
pillar
to
the
embroidered
cover
of
an
altar
or
the
silken
hangings
of
a
bed
or
the
framed
flat
spaces
on
the
walls
of
a
saloon
in
fact
intention
place
and
shape
are
necessary
motives
and
limits
to
a
flat
design
leaving
aside
all
architectural
ornamentation
and
adhering
only
to
my
own
subject
embroidery
i
will
limit
my
observations
to
the
three
purposes
here
suggested
firstly
as
the
central
effect
of
the
holiest
part
of
a
church
secondly
in
the
domestic
and
comfortable
room
to
be
adorned
and
made
cheerful
and
thirdly
as
decking
the
refined
and
gay
saloon
or
to
the
church
we
should
devote
the
most
splendid
and
effective
contrasts
to
blaze
unframed
against
dark
empty
backgrounds
or
amidst
stone
and
marble
decorations
something
set
apart
from
its
surroundings
and
asserting
that
separation
is
the
desirable
effect
to
be
attained
a
totally
different
set
of
rules
come
into
play
when
we
have

of
a

here
a
background
does
not
exist
we
are
surrounded
by
four
walls
very
near
to
the
eye
so
that
perspectives
are
a
secondary
interest
if
indeed
they
can
claim
any
consideration
severe
and
magnificent
ornamentation
is
out
of
place
except
perhaps
in
that
institution
to
be
found
in
every
great
house
possessing
a
suite
of
the
state
bedroom
where
the
display
of
hangings
and
embroideries
was
the
first
motive
of
the
decoration
of

past

garnishing

spaces
on

space
and
separateness
are
not
the
object
or
aim
of
the
bedroom
of
but
lightness
snugness
and
cheerful
comfort
with
which
the
design
of
the
textile
ornaments
have
much
to
do
this
will
in
a
later
chapter
come
under
the
head
of
furniture
for
the
saloon
we
may
accept
any
splendour
of
rich
and
costly
design
and
the
variously
shaped
panels
assist
in
suggesting
the
form
of
the
decoration
the
plain
or
moulded
panels
called
in
italian
targhe
or
shields
seem
to
be
descended
from
the
actual
shields
of
gold
which
solomon
hung
on
the
walls
of
the
king
house
in
the
forest
of
lebanon
the
motive
was
apparently
tyrian
and
traces
of
it
are
also
to
be
found
in
assyrian
sculpture
the
practice
of
framing
the
design
gives
opportunities
for
change
of
materials
colour
and
pattern
permitting
the
employment
of
different
flat
surfaces
laid
on
each
other
and
scope
for
endless
enrichment
the
framed
picture
being
perhaps
the
central
culminating
attraction
crowning
as
it
were
the
textile
ornamentation
i
merely
give
these
instances
as
illustrating
the
rule
that
we
have
more
than
once
laid
down
that
a
design
can
not
fitly
be
employed
except
in
the
position
for
which
the
artist
has
composed
it
i
will
however
add
that
though
it
is
right
to
give
due
consideration
to
the
preparation
of
each
work
for
its
intended
use
yet
we
often
have
charming
suggestions
offered
to
us
by
the
chance
acquisition
of
a
beautiful
artistic
specimen
which
finds
its
own
place
and
accommodates
itself
to
the
surrounding
colours
and
forms
these
are
the
happy
accidents
of
which
the
cultivated
artistic
eye
takes
advantage
adding
them
to
the
experience
which
may
help
those
who
are
seeking
for
the
rules
of
harmony
and
contrast
in
design
research
into
the
mysteries
and
principles
of
design
applies
to
woven
arabesques
and
patterns
and
must
include
textile
ornament
and
all
decorative
needlework
it
is
in
fact
the
fabric
for
the
million
which
most
especially
needs
the
careful
study
of
guiding
rules
when
a
plant
sends
forth
hundreds
of
winged
seeds
like
the
thistle
it
spreads
itself
over
wide
fields
and
is
more
mischievous
than
a
more
noxious
growth
such
as
the
deadly
nightshade
which
only
drops
an
occasional
berry
into
the
earth
so
a
common
cheap
chintz
or
carpet
with
a
poor
gaudy
motiveless
design
carries
a
bad
style
into
thousands
of
homes
wherever
our
commerce
extends
disgracing
us
while
it
corrupts
the
taste
of
other
nations
in
addressing
our
young
designers
i
would
remind
them
that
in
art
the
race
is
not
always
to
the
strong
prudence
and
educated
powers
thoughtfulness
and
study
often
carry
us
where
unassisted
and
uncultivated
genius
has
signally
failed
even
such
facilities
as
are
afforded
by
the
acquirement
of
freehand
drawing
as
taught
in
our
schools
of
art
are
not
to
be
despised
the
workman
should
thoroughly
master
his
tools
or
they
will
hamper
him
the
first
step
towards
design
is
that
you
should
learn
to
draw
after
this
appreciation
and
observation
are
necessary
and
due
balance
in
outline
and
colour
should
be
studied
and
all
this
is
as
much
needed
in
drawing
a
pattern
as
in
composing
a
picture
the
difference
lies
in
our
art
being
only
decorative
wherein
beauty
and
fitness
are
to
be
remembered
and
nothing
else
whereas
the
picture
may
have
to
record
historical
facts
or
to
inspire
poetical
thoughts
to
awe
or
to
touch
the
beholder
a
decorative
design
is
only
asked
to
delight
him
intelligent
delight
however
can
only
be
evoked
by
intelligent
art
and
to
this
decoration
must
be
subjected

the
earliest
art
we
know
the
is
naturalistic
and
imitative
we
are
unaware
of
any
attempt
at
a
pattern
of
the
prehistoric
period
the
lake
cities
are
of
so
vague
a
date
that
their
ornaments
on
pottery
are
puzzling
rather
than
instructive
the
earliest
hellenic
pottery
was
scratched
or
painted
repeated
over
and
over
again
are
among
the
earliest
attempts
at
a
pattern
by
repetition
of
a
natural
object
naturalism
soon
fell
into
symbolism
which
appropriated
it
and
all
art
and
the
upheaval
of
a
new
culture
was
needed
to
lift
it
once
more
into
the
region

individual
creation

which
belong

for
this
is
a
general
law
that
supposing
the
intellect

the
workman
the
same

his

the
less

we

the
imitative

of
all

most
civilized

the

depends

whether

or

the
flatness
of
the
picture
is
still
preserved
by
their

they
attempted
to
express

they
did
so
by
placing

which

let
us
protect
ourselves
against
its
possible
recurrence
while
making
this
passing
allusion
to
the
theory
that
the
origin
of
all
gothic
decoration
is
mainly
founded
on
the
motive
of
interlacing
stems
and
foliage
i
wish
to
guard
myself
against
being
supposed
in
any
way
to
argue
against
other
beginnings
whenever
they
can
be
proved
i
have
said
before
that
most
decorations
have
a
mixed
ancestry
but
when
i
see
single
or
clustered
columns
starting
from
the
ground
spreading
at
the
base
like
the
gnarled
root
and
growing
till
they
culminate
in
crowns
of
foliage
forming
symmetrical
capitals
like
the
first
clusters
of
leaves
on
a
strong
young
sapling
then
the
branches
spreading
and
interlacing
only
checked
at
equal
intervals
by
a
lovely
leaf
or
burgeon
till
they
meet
in
blossoms
on
the
highest
point
of
the
arch
i
can
not
but
adhere
to
the
old
idea
that
rows
of
trees
meeting
overhead
suggested
gothic
ornament
as
well
as
gothic
architecture
the
spanish
or
moresque
gothic
was
overloaded
with
leaves
and
flowers
and
the
german
gothic
was
enriched
with
fantastic
trees
and
flowers
each
according
to
its
national
taste
and
fashion
a
gothic
tree
is
a
very
conventional
plant
and
generally
carries
only
one
leaf
on
each
branch
i
have
given
a
specimen
of
archaic
trees
from
the
bayeux
tapestry
they
are
typical
of
the
gothic
botanical
idea
and
style
down
to
the
fourteenth
century
fig
nor
is
this
interpretation
of
gothic
design
other
than
a
result
of
its
descent
from
the
egyptian
ancestral
motive
where
the
temple
columns
represented
the
single
stem
of
the
lotus
with
one
large
blossom
for
its
capital
or
else
a
bundle
of
stems
of
the
lotus
palm
and
convolvulus
flowering
together
into
a
beautiful
cluster
even
the
gigantic
columns
of
the
great
hypæthral
hall
at
karnac
are
only
a
stupendous
exaggeration
of
the
same
stalk
and
flower
motive
from
these
were
derived
the
forms
of
the
early
greek
column
soon
enriched
by
substituting
the
acanthus
for
the
lotus
but
often
retaining
the
convolvulus

patterns
in
the
last
chapter
on
design
i
have
described
patterns
as
the
examples
or
illustrations
of
the
art
of
decoration
and
as
being
the
records
of
the
motives
which
produced
them
in
different
eras
my
present
object
is
to
class
and
define
patterns
as
decorative
art
it
is
argued
by
some
archæologists
that
the
recurrence
of
a
pattern
for
instance
the
wave
over
the
whole
world
proves
that
it
really
came
from
many
sources
under
the
same
conditions
of
life
and
art
showing
also
that
a
pattern
is
a
thing
that
like
a
flower
must
grow
if
the
culture
of
the
race
be
equal
i
do
not
believe
this
we
can
nearly
always
trace
the
family
history
of
a
pattern
to
its
original
motive
and
in
the
very
few
cases
where
we
are
unable
to
do
so
it
is
hardly
necessary
to
cover
our
ignorance
by
stretching
the
fashionable
theory
of
development
over
the
few
instances
that
are
as
yet
unaccountable
i
have
been
repeatedly
asked
to
procure
or
to
invent
a
new
pattern
such
is
my
respect
for
the
decorative
achievement
called
a
pattern
that
i
can
not
hope
for
the
moment
of
inspiration
in
which
i
might
create
such
a
thing
if
any
one
has
in
his
lifetime
invented
a
pattern
he
has
done
something
truly
remarkable
and
as
rare
as
is
a
really
original
thought
on
any
subject
patterns
are
commonly
like
men
the
result
of
many
centuries
of
long
descent
from
ancestors
of
remote
antiquity
individuals
differ
from
their
ancestors
through
inherited
and
surrounding
conditions
and
through
the
modifying
powers
of
evolution
climate
and
education
so
also
a
pattern
has
besides
its
ancestry
and
descent
the
unconscious
mark
or
seal
of
its
day
and
it
is
easy
to
trace
whence
it
comes
if
we
set
ourselves
to
examine
the
style
of
it
seriously
the
patterns
of
which
we
can
nearly
always
name
at
once
the
nationality
are
the
assyrian
the
chinese
the
egyptian
the
hindu
aryan
and
turanian
the
persian
the
archaic
and
the
highly
developed
grecian
the
roman
the
celtic
the
byzantine
the
arabian
the
gothic
the
renaissance
the
spanish
plâteresque
the
louis
quatorze
and
those
of
the
art
of
central
america
the
pattern
can
not
exist
without
design
design
means
intention
and
motive
many
of
the
motives
in
oriental
textile
decorations
are
suggestive
of
intention
as
is
shown
by
their
names
among
indian
patterns
we
meet
with
ripples
of
silver
sunshine
and
shade
pigeon
eye
peacock
neck
patterns
must
be
classed
either
by
their
dates
when
ascertained
or
according
to
their
style
which
must
generally
be
allowed
to
cover
vast
areas
and
periods
irregularly
drifting
down
overlapping
or
being
absorbed
or
effaced
by
the
circumstances
they
have
encountered
only
when
a
national
style
has
been
obstinately
fixed
as
in
china
and
bound
down
by
strict
laws
and
religious
formulas
suited
exactly
to
the
people
for
whom
they
were
evolved
out
of
the
national
life
and
imprinted
on
it
by
their
own
lawgivers
philosophers
and
priests
and
neither
imposed
by
conquerors
nor
swept
over
by
the
waves
of
a
new
civilization
only
in
such
cases
can
we
find
a
continuity
of
decorative
art
which
leads
us
far
back
on
its
traces
then
on
this
long
track
we
learn
how
little
man
the
decorating
animal
has
really
advanced
in
his
powers
of
creation
he
has
gone
more
than
once
to
a
certain
point
and
has
then
either
been
petrified
by
law
and
custom
turned
into
a
pillar
of
salt
like
lot
wife
because
he
has
looked
back
instead
of
striving
to
advance
or
else
through
poverty
or
satiety
has
fallen
into
the
last
stage
of
the
seven
ages
eyes
teeth
everything
when
what
is
good
is
neither
perceived
nor
desired
then
the
arts
small
and
great
dwindle
and
disappear
and
nothing
remains
to
show
that
they
have
been
but
a
name
and
perhaps
a
pattern
chinese
design
is
the
most
striking
example
of
the
first
of
these
phases
and
the
extinction
of
all
classical
art
with
the
fall
of
paganism
in
rome
is
an
instance
of
the
second
in
the
chapter
on
style
it
is
said
that
a
pattern
is
as
ineffaceable
as
a
word
but
one
will
occasionally
disappear
for
a
time
till
the
ruin
that
covers
it
is
cleared
away
and
the
lost
design
recovered
and
employed
simply
as
a
decoration
if
it
is
beautiful
or
perhaps
fitted
with
a
new
meaning
and
so
it
makes
a
fresh
start
the
importance
of
patterns
when
traceable
to
their
origin
as
a
means
of
investigating
historical
influences
can
not
be
too
much
insisted
on
and
their
history
is
full
of
suggestion
as
a
guide
to
the
decorator
much
has
been
argued
and
much
ascertained
from
the
evidence
of
these
fragments
of
national
civilizations
showing
how
an
idea
or
a
myth
has
been
as
it
were
engrafted
into
the
essence
of
another
national
idea
partly
altering
what
it
finds
and
changing
to
fit
itself
to
its
new
surroundings
eastern
patterns
have
travelled
far
and
lasted
long
and
continue
still
to
hold
the
fancy
and
exercise
the
ingenuity
of
the
artist
and
decorator
when
we
find
a
pattern
of
which
the
nationality
is
strongly
marked
it
is
worth
our
while
to
ascertain
its
date
and
history
which
will
help
us
to
recognize
cognate
design
wherever
we
may
meet
it
however
this
is
often
not
to
be
done
and
then
it
is
best
to
set
these
puzzling
examples
aside
and
to
await
patiently
the
elucidation
which
may
come
from
some
source
of
which
we
are
as
yet
ignorant
in
very
early
art
we
have
little
remaining
but
patterns
on
which
we
may
found
theories
by
tracing
them
home
to
their
original
source
the
oldest
patterns
had
each
a
meaning
and
an
intention
when
a
pattern
has
been
enduring
and
far
spread
it
is
because
it
was
originally
the
expression
of
an
idea
or
a
symbol
in
the
earliest
dawn
of
civilization
the
arts
were
the
repositories
of
the
myths
and
mysteries
of
national
faiths
embroidery
was
one
of
these
arts
and
the
border
which
edged
the
garment
of
a
divinity
the
veil
which
covered
the
grave
of
a
loved
one
or
the
and
fruit
which
fringed
the
hangings
and
curtains
in
the
sanctuary
each
had
a
meaning
and
therefore
a
use
these
symbolical
designs
and
forms
were
constantly
reproduced
and
all
human
ingenuity
was
exercised
in
reforming
remodelling
and
adding
perfect
grace
to
the
expression
of
the
same
idea
patterns
may
be
ranged
under
four
heads
the
primitive
the
naturalistic
the
conventional
and
the
geometrical
the
primitive
are
those
of
which
we
know
not
the
ancestry
and
rarely
can
guess
the
motive
to
us
they
are
in
general
simply
rude
decorations
the
naturalistic
are
those
which
are
borrowed
from
natural
forms
and
are
either
only
imitative
or
else
convey
some
hidden
meaning
the
conventional
are
those
which
by
long
descent
have
come
to
be
accepted
simply
as
ornamental
art
with
or
without
reference
to
an
original
motive
now
lost
the
geometrical
or
symmetrical
are
founded
on
form
only
and
in
so
far
resemble
our
experience
of
the
primitive
they
express
no
meaning
and
only
serve
to
satisfy
the
eye
by
their
balance
and
their
ingenuity
primitive
the
first
patterned
forms
with
which
we
are
acquainted
are
the
primitive
they
are
found
in
all
parts
of
the
inhabited
world
in
our
present
ignorance
as
to
the
beginnings
of
the
scattered
tribes
of
men
we
can
not
judge
if
these
are
the
remains
of
an
earlier
art
or
the
first
germs
of
a
new
one
of
one
thing
there
is
no
doubt
this
primitive
decoration
consists
entirely
of
pattern
that
is
to
say
of
the
repetition
of
certain
to
us
inexpressive
forms
which
by
reiteration
assume
importance
and
in
some
degree
express
beauty
the
beauty
of
what
monsieur
blanc
calls
cadence
after
these
first
unintelligible
forms
which
simply
by
repetition
become
accepted
patterns
come
those
called
the
prehistoric
of
which
we
know
or
guess
something
as
to
their
original
meaning
and
which
having
been
reduced
from
the
to
the
conventional
have
thus
crystallized
themselves
by
constant
use
into
a
pattern
such
for
instance
is
the
simplest
form
of
the
wave
pattern
which
in
very
early
art
was
a
representation
of
water
the
prehistoric
water
or
wave
patterns
had
other
forms
for
instance
zigzags
upright
or
horizontal
and
undulating
lines
which
are
intelligible
as
expressing
smooth
or
rough
water
in
general
however
the
primitive
and
prehistoric
patterns
convey
no
idea
and
consist
as
we
have
said
elsewhere
of
lines
straight
or
wavy
sometimes
intersected
of
angles
zigzags
groups
of
dots
rings
and
little

where

it
is
certainly
primitive
and
apparently
had
no

beyond
that
of
employing
as
many
coloured
threads
as
there
were
dyes
so
as
to
form
the
brightest
contrasts
or
else
to
be
as
invisible
as
possible
either
in

sunshine
or
in

the
gauls
brought
this
kind
of
weaving
with
them
from
the
east
and
probably
invented
the
pattern
if
such
a
motiveless
design
can
be
so
called
it
had
its
classical
name
polymita
and
was
admired
in
rome
when
newly
imported
as
being
something
original
and
barbaric
the
romans
found
it
in
britain
and
boadicea
wore
a
tartan
dress
on
the
day
of
her
defeat
perhaps
even
then
fashions
came
from
france
and
it
may
have
been
her
best
tunic
from
across
the
channel
this
fabric
may
have
been
imported
by
the
belgic
gauls
and
was
so
easily
woven
on
house
looms
that
it
became
in
time
the
feudal
dress
of
the
scottish
tribes
and
clans
and
the
colours
were
ingeniously
arranged
to
show
the
most
different
effects
the
tartan
has
always
been
a
resource
for
the
woollen
trade
and
the
fashion
constantly
recurs
in
france
either
from
sentiment
or
the
actually
inherited
gallic
taste
but
it
remains
a
primitive
pattern
and
nothing
can
make
it
artistic
no
embroidery
can
soften
the
constantly
recurring
angles
and
only
fringes
can
be
employed
to
decorate
a
tartan
costume

us
of
the
ingenuity
of

to

had

especially
throughout

curious
to
say
the
very
ancient
fossilized

of

does
not
assist
us
to
trace
it
back
to
a
prehistoric
style
though
it
may
lead
us
into
prehistoric
times
naturalistic
the
phases
of
the
naturalistic
patterns
are
constantly
recurring
art
is
always
tending
to
realism
in
the
laudable
effort
to
reach
the
motive
without
the
shackles
of
rules
each
phase
has
fallen
a
prey
to
symbolism
to
conventionalism
or
to
mannerism
which
last
symptom
marks
the
decline
and
fall
of
art
we
shall
find
these
phases
everywhere
in
the
design
of
patterns
naturalism
has
always
striven
by
simple
repetition
to
reduce
to
patterns
the
forms
of
flowers
fruits
animals
birds
insects
reptiles
and
other
natural
objects
in
flower
patterns
the
simplest
forms
by
repetition
make
sometimes
the
richest
patterns
and
the
most
effective
plate
nos
and
it
is
remarkable
that
one
very
beautiful
class
of
natural
objects
is
rarely
employed
in
ancient
decoration
shells
and
corals
the
barbarous
tribes
of
the
west
coast
of
africa
alone
seem
to
have
appreciated
their
forms
and
added
them
to
their
small
repertory
of
naturalistic
patterns
they
do
not
appear
in
any
european
or
asiatic
textiles
till
the
seventeenth
century
when
shells
were
much
used
in
the
decorations
of
the
reigns
of
queen
anne
and
louis
quatorze
the
first
change
from
naturalism
into
the
conventional
was
through
symbolism
and
belonged
to
the
time
when
unwritten
thought
was
first
recorded
by
pictured
signs
which
then
ceased
to
be
merely
decoration
we
find
that
the
naturalism
of
the
earliest
egyptians
and
asiatics
was
soon
entirely
absorbed
by
the
effort
to
express
some
hidden
meaning
or
mystery
and
then
to
fit
the
representation
to
a
special
place
and
purpose
and
to
restore
it
as
it
were
to
decorative
art

the

notable
examples
of
these
transmutations
in
style
and
intention
and
of
the
value
given
to
their
intention
and
use
in
egypt
and
india
where
each
development
was
immediately
crystallized
into
a
recognized
pattern
and
given
its
place
and
language
it
received
its
and
continued
to
act
upon
it
long
after
the
meaning
was
forgotten
or
out
of
date
the
rolling
pattern
which
had
so
long
represented
only
the

was
given
to
the
really
straight

of
the
lotus

its

a

the

in

were
still
bound
in
sheaves
to
form
columns
and
the
flowers
buds
and
leaves
spread
and
blossomed
into
capitals
here
we
have
symbolism
and
conventionalized
naturalism
all
combined
showing
how
their
principles
though
quite
distinct
can
mix
and
unite
the
conventional
form
often
superseded
and
effaced
the
naturalistic
and
became
the
sign
of
an
idea
or
the
hieroglyphic
picture
of
a
thing
immovable
and
unalterable
in
egypt
where
every
effort
was
made
to
secure
eternity
on
earth
but
continually
returning
to
naturalism
in
india
where
the
aryan
tendency
with
the
assistance
of
the
code
of
manu
always
recurred
to
the
restoration
of
the
ancient
naturalistic
motive
in
the
india
museum
we
may
see
the
wave
motive
converted
into
a
lotus
pattern
by
rolling
the
long
stems
and
filling
up
the
spaces
between
with
the
blossom
sometimes
the
pattern
is
started
by
the
figure
of
an
elephant
from
whose
mouth
the
stem
of
the
flower
of
the
sun
proceeds
this
occurs
so
often
that
it
must
originally
have
had
a
meaning

are
entirely
conventional
and
are
in
fact
a
sort
of
recognized
hieroglyphic
representing
the
idea
of
a
lotus
the
lotus
was
the
accepted
emblem
of
the
sun

reduced

i
have
given
this
account
of
the
patterns
founded
on
the
lotus
as
we
can
almost
from
this
distance
of
time
take
a
view
of
its
rise
in
naturalism
its
spread
dispersion
and
its
crystallization
into
conventional
forms
also
we
can
trace
how
the
lotus
patterns
of
indian
art
have
resulted
when
accepted
in
europe
in
nothing
but
the
rolling
wave
carrying
flower
forms
which
no
longer
represent
a
lotus
and
how
the
lotus
bud
and
flower
pattern
has
become
in
time
the
classical
egg
and
tongue
which
however
may
have
resulted
also
from
a
combination
of
other
motives
representations
of
animal
forms
are
sometimes
very
remarkable
in
phases
of
naturalism
the
few
remains
of
celtic
art
that
have
survived
are
entirely
animal
or
very
nearly
so
in
their
stone
gold
silver
and
bronze
work
and
in
illuminated
we
meet
with
only
animal
forms
never
a
flower
or
a
leaf
besides
the
patterns
in
celtic
art
which
suggest
the
chinese
so
strongly
insisted
on
by
semper
as
a
constant
motive
we
also
find
in
all
their
decorations
compartments
containing
involved
patterns
of
cords
or
strings
knitted
or
plaited
suggesting
the
entrails
of
animals
which
by
these
hunting
people
were
consulted
as
being
mysteriously
prophetic
of
approaching
events
especially
success
or
failure
in
the
chase
and
impending
warlike
raids
there
is
no
other
way
of
accounting
for
these
designs
which
are
peculiar
to
the
race
unless
we
believe
they
always
represent
snakes
pl
in
england
much
that
was
characteristic
of
the
style
was
lost
as
soon
as
the
saxons
drove
out
the
celts
who
carried
it
to
ireland
as
may
be
seen
in
the
book
of
kells
and
the
carving
of
the
harp
of
tara
and
the
celtic
jewels
in
the
irish
museums
but
the
interlacing
patterns
survived
throughout
art
and
were
marvellously
ingenious
and
beautiful
witness

book
of
cuthbert
we
have
no
celtic
textiles
remaining
to
us
unless
some
embroidery
in
the
collection

may
be
of
that
style

is
suggested
by
its

precisely
the

style
of
design
and
the
one

the
other
these
instances
are
so
exceptional
that
it
is
curious
that
here
as
in
the
case
of

in
each
case
there
should
happen
to
be
a
duplicate
plates
and
no

art
we
constantly
find
animal
forms
in
patterns
the
lion

the
hare
birds

insects

the
commonest
and
there
are
some
instances
of
human

and
of
course
when
such
a
design
is
small
it
ceases
to
be
very
objectionable
on
the
whole
however
naturalistic
designs
for
embroideries
are
more
safely
confined
to
floral
decorations
excepting
always
flat
tapestries
for
walls
which
representing
pictures
may
be
as
naturalistic
as
their
purpose
and
style
will
admit

often
reduced

patterns
by
repetition
in

hardly
worthy

altar
frontal
was
exhibited
at
zurich
in
containing
some
really
exquisitely
worked

were
quite
out
of

as

and
as
decoration

an
ecclesiastical
purpose

of
the
beginning
of
the
last
century
while
we
appreciate
and
should
take
advantage
of
our
national
tendency
to
naturalistic
design
we
must
beware
of
looking
on
fixed
rules
as
bonds
which
cramp
our
liberty
and
of
thinking
that
nature
should
be
our
only
guide
to
an
otherwise
unassisted
and
unfettered
inspiration
without
the
wholesome
checks
of
experience
and
educated
taste
and
the
knowledge
which
teaches
us
what
to
avoid
as
well
as
what
to

on
the
successes
and

out
how
unpleasant
and
jarring
to
our

of
what

and
therefore
how
offensive
to
good

it
is
to
tread
on
a
carpet
of
swimming
in

pools

on

probably
towards

alarming
rather
than
agreeable
and
are
of
the
nature
of
a
practical
joke
in
art
it
is
the
search
for
novelty
in
naturalism
that
leads
to
such
astonishing
compositions
and
these
being
successively
rejected
in
the
heart
of
our
civilization
and
culture
are
drifted
away
to
vulgarize
our
colonies
or
to
be
sold
cheap
to
furnish
continental
hotels

make
the
english
traveller
blush
for
his
home
manufactures
symbolical
and
conventional
though
it
is
true
that
the
highest
art
pictorial
and
sculptural
is
always
struggling
towards
naturalism
the
art
of
decoration
is
by
its
nature
constantly
tending
to
conventionalism
patterns
if
not
absolutely
geometrical
or
naturalistic
must
be
classed
under
this
principle
let
us
examine
what
is
meant
by
a
conventional
pattern
it
may
be
said
that
the
conventional
includes
every
form
the
symbolic
the
naturalistic
or
even
the
hieroglyphic
that
is
selected
and
consecrated
to
convey
a
certain
idea
the
lily
of
florence
which
is
something
between
a
lily
and
an
iris
but
unlike
either
is
a
conventional
form
likewise
the
lily
of
france
which
it
is
said
was
once
a
conventional
frog
the
rose
of
england
the
shamrock
and
the
thistle
have
always
been
more
naturalistic
than
is
usual
in
such
heraldic
designs
but
the
rose
of
york
and
lancaster
was
decidedly
conventional
and
heraldic
conventional
patterns
now
are
those
which
having
been
originally
naturalistic
in
style
but
perhaps
emblematic
as
to
their
motive
have
been
repeated
till
the
meaning
and
form
have
been
lost
or
else
as
in
the
case
of
the
lotus
the
emblem
is
forgotten
and
nothing
remains
but
the
recognized
conventional
form
one
conventional
pattern
which
having
commenced
by
being
a
symbol
has
been
repeated
and
varied
till
it
has
allowed
the
original
essential
meaning
to
escape
is
the
or
cone
pattern
on
french
or
paisley
shawls
which
having
been
a
sacred
emblem
the
tree
of
life
in
persia
became
in
europe
when
the
religious
myth
was
lost
only
a

nos
decorative
designs
become
conventional
in
spite
of
the
intention
of
the
designer
he
is
overruled
by
the
spaces
to
be
covered
and
the
materials
to
be
employed
his
design
must
produce
a
flat
pattern
he
must
repeat
it
again
and
again
he
must
give
it
a
strong
outline
he
must
distribute
it
regularly
at
certain
intervals
repetition
at
once
conventionalizes
the
most
naturalistic
drawing
and
the
most
sacred
and
mysterious
emblem
alternation
is
equally
a
source
of
conventionalism
there
is
no
motive
that
can
not
be
conventionalized
into
a
pattern
by
repetition
a
gothic
crown
and
a
true
lily
repeated
will
make
an
ecclesiastical
conventional
pattern
then
come
all
the
arabian
and
moresque
forms
which
are
mostly
geometric
and
also
the
gothic
which
are
partly
geometric
and
partly
naturalistic

these
exist
sometimes
apart
and
sometimes
mingled
so
that
some
thought
must
be
expended
in
seeking
the
motive
which
has
brought
them
together
and
finding
in
each
the
internal
evidence
of
its
descent
it
is
evident
that
patterns
conventionalized
and
brought
from
distant
sources
sometimes
meet
and
amalgamate
when
the
origin
of
a
conventional
pattern
is
disputed
it
is
worth
while
to
examine
if
it
has
a
double
parentage
let
me
give
as
an
instance
the
key
pattern
it
may
have
been
as
semper
believes
originally
chinese
and
derived
from
design
it
represents
also
the
broken
or
dislocated
wave
the
symbol
of
the
river
mæander
and
for
water
generally
we
find
it
everywhere
in
company
with
the
wave
which
never
could
have
had
any
connection
with
not
only
in
china
but
in
persia
india
egypt
arabia
greece
rome
and
central
america
pl
can
any
invention
of
man
show
a
more
symbolical
intention
than
the
wave
pattern
the
airy
leap
drawn
downwards
by
the
force
of
gravitation
controlled
and
again
made
to
return
but
strong
to
insist
on
its
own
curve
of
predilection
rushing
back
under
the
same
circle
strengthened
by
the
downward
movement
to
spring
again
from
its
original
plane
beginning
afresh
its
sisyphus
labour
and
facing
the
next
effort
with
the
same
grace
and
agility
undying
force
and
eternal
flowing
unrest
these
are
the
evident
intention
and
symbol
of
the
wave
pattern
though
i
believe
the
key
pattern
to
be
a
modification
of
the
wave
form
yet
the
locking
and
unlocking
movement
suggests
a
repetition

differing

it

these

of
the

allusions

groping
faiths
of

what
strikes
us
most
is
the
constant

the
little
variety
of
ornament
in
these
patterns
the
forms
are
strongly
marked

the
symbolism
of

filled
many
volumes
in

mediæval
ages
and
are
well
worthy
of
the
study
of
the
decorative
artist
the
symbolism
of
animals
and
birds
especially
constantly
attracts
our
attention
in
the
oriental
and
sicilian
textiles
of
the
early
christian
times
and
to
the
end
of
the
thirteenth
century
later
in
european
textile
decoration
most
animals
were
accepted
as
emblematic
in
christian
art
beginning
with
the
symbols
of
the
four
evangelists
all
the
virtues
and
all
the
vices
found
their
animal
emblems
conventionalized
and
were
thus
woven
embroidered
and
painted
reptiles
and
insects
are
included
under
the
head
of
beasts
and
perhaps
fishes
also
each
was
dowered
with
a
symbolical
meaning
and
thus
admitted
into
art
they
were
conventionalized
by
being
strongly
outlined
coloured
flat
and
by
repetition
without
variation
were
converted
into
patterns

its

motives

were
succeeded
by

then
the

disappeared

extinguished
all
the

a
return

represent

all
floreated

meandering

reminding
one
of

the
acanthus

of

stems
meeting

parting
but
never
anything
naturalistic

a
moment
when

were

it
was
always
as
a

we
may
say
the
same
of

there
is
nothing
really
unnatural
in

way

they

the
illustration

explains
my
meaning
it
has
been
already
observed
that
by
repetition
almost
any
object
may
be
reduced
to
a
pattern
but
taste
must
be
exercised
in
the
selection
of
what
is
appropriate
and
beautiful
radiation
is
also
really
a
useful
factor
in
conventional
art
but
common
sense
must
guide
the
artist
here
as
well
as
taste
in
radiating
the
forms
of
a
flower
nature
gives
endless
hints
of
beauty
but
a
radiating
pattern
of
human
figures
would
be
ridiculous

even
the
branches
of
a
tree
can
not
be
so
treated
the
awning
of
the

often
reproduced
in
roman
arabesques
sometimes
we
find
it
in
a
classical
tomb
painted
over
the
ceiling
and
recalling
its
original
use
this
was
revived
in
the
renaissance
and
again
in
adams
eighteenth
century
decorations
it
became
an
accepted
pattern

the

its
original
motive

descending
to
fill
up
the
panels

surround

thus
reduced

a
judicious

as
they
could
go
no
further
there
they
remained
i
have
often
spoken
of
the
extraordinary
survival
of
a

this
is
easy
to
account
for
when

the
disturber

not
yet
existed
then
the
ancient
motive
told
its
own
tale

its
great
age
was
its
claim
to
perpetual
youth

it
is
more
remarkable
where
we
meet
with
revivals
at
distant
periods
and
apparently
without
any
connecting
link
of
ancestry

style

in
the
italian
pictures
of
the
fourteenth
and
fifteenth
centuries
are
probably
descended
the
moorish
patterns
are
geometrical
and
are
created
on
the
principle
of
avoiding
in
art
the
representation
of
any
created
thing
they
show
much
ingenuity
in
keeping
clear
of
any
possible
meaning
most
of
these
conventional
patterns
are
founded
on
the
and
a
kind
of
honeycomb
pattern
involved
and
inverted
their
tiles
which
nearest
approach
textile
design
have
indeed
certain
vegetable
forms
added
to
the
others
but
always
geometrically
arranged
as
no
vegetables
ever
grew
geometrical
patterns
begin
with
primitive
forms
and
come
down
to
the
designs
of
they
can
be
extracted
in
endless
variety
from
the
combinations
of
the
kaleidoscope
this
style
is
well
suited
for
pavements
in
mosaic
either
secular
or
ecclesiastical
the
opus
alexandrinum
furnishes
us
with
most
beautiful
examples
and
adaptations
for
large
or
small
spaces
so
as
to
form
the
richest
or
the
simplest
floor
decorations
how
worthily
a
church
may
be
thus
adorned
may

vast
area
of
the

or
that
of
the

of

in

the
nearest
approach
to
the
opus
alexandrinum
in
textiles
has
been
in
patchwork
of
which
a
more
artistic
use
may
yet
be
made
we
might
exercise
ingenuity
in
this
direction
giving
really
fine
and
effective
designs
to
our
workers
in
patches
whose
productions
are
in
general
simply
alarming
the
fine
quilting
patterns
of
the
sixteenth
and
seventeenth
centuries
are
almost
always
geometrical
and
make
the
best
background
to
more
resplendent
embroideries
overlying
them
which
is
partly
owing
to
their
being
only
forms
and
conveying
no
idea
or
inherited
meaning
these
expressionless
designs
are
well
fitted
for
spaces
and
borders
in
which
the
centres
are
elaborated
and
require
enclosing
or
framing
likewise
they
are
suited
for
large
areas
which
must
not
be
perfectly
plain
and
yet
not
too
disturbing
to
the
eye
so
as
to
distract
it
from
the
more
important
ornaments
on
the
wall
or
ceiling
they
suit
carpets
in
passages
or
on
staircases
much
better
than
any
other
kind
of
design
and
form
the
best
figured
backgrounds
for
pictures
both
eye
and
mind
often
need
repose
and
therefore
the
simpler
the
geometrical
pattern
is
the
better
complicated
and
too
ingenious
combinations
are
painfully
fatiguing
simplicity
and
flatness
are
the
greatest
merits
in
such
forms
as
in
shadowless
patterns
for
textiles
and
especially
for
embroideries
if
we
turn
to
nature
to
assist
us
with
new
geometrical
patterns
we
shall
find
the
most
exquisite
forms
in
the
crystals
of
every
snowflake
and
in
the
on
a
plate
of
metal
or
glass
covered
with
sand
and
struck
by
sound
we
shall
hardly
ever
find
in
these
a
repetition
of
exactly
the
same
combination
and
their
variety
is
only
equalled
by
their
beauty

should
like
to
draw
attention

these
facts

microscope
the
forms
of
these
raw
materials
differ
greatly
flax
is
difficult
to
describe
as
it
varies
according
to
the
soil
and
climate
it
comes
from
its
fibre
however
has
always
a
shiny
outer
surface
and
is
transparent
cylindrical
and
apparently
with
breaks
or
joints
like
those
of
a
cane
cotton
also
varies
so
much
in
its
own
kind
that
every
description
is
different
and
somewhat
puzzling
semper
says
that
it
approaches
the
ribbon
form
with
thickened
edges
and
is
like
a
twisted
spirally
but
when
wetted
with
oil
it
swells
into
a
complete
cylinder
wool
and
hair
are
hollow
pipes
without
joints
woollen
fibres
look
like
cylindrical
snakes
with
a
scaly
surface
this
roughness
gives
wool
a
clinging
power
which
exceeds
that
of
any
other
material
except
the
hair
of
some
few
animals
silk
threads
consist
of
twin
pipes
laid
parallel
and
held
together
by
the
varnish
with
which
they
are
glazed
silk
is
tough
and
elastic
the
qualities
needed
for
textile
materials
may
be
thus
enumerated
pliability
toughness
tensile
strength
and
intrinsic
durability
of
course
the
material
must
to
a
certain
degree
influence
the
style
of
the
fabric
and
its
selection
must
be
according
to
the
effect
intended
to
be
produced
the
fashions
of
the
day
and
the
needs
of
the
special
manufacture
must
greatly
modify
the
choice
of
materials
which
fluctuate
often
disappear
and
sometimes
revive
again
certain
materials
which
have
been
at
one
period
much
admired
have
been
entirely
lost
and
indeed
we
may
say
that
the
only
permanently
employed
textiles
are
wool
flax
cotton
and
silk
which
apparently
never
can
be
superseded
with
them
all
domestic
requirements
can
be
satisfied
and
all
artistic
and
decorative
fabrics
produced
varied
and
perfected
and
these
from
all
time
recorded
in

have
been
enriched
and
glorified

gold
either
inwoven
or
embroidered
the
game
of
animal
vegetable
or
mineral
might
well
be
played

textiles
only
nothing
has
been

crafts
which
from

have
spun

felted
netted

are
wool

these
i

add
hemp
both
wild

hemp
is
a
kind
of
nettle
it
was
grown
in
colchis
and
in
those
cool
regions
which
did
not
produce

hemp

of
the
above
five
most
important
factors
in

the
history
of
wool
must
take
precedence
as
being
that
of
the
original
if
not
the
first
of
textile
materials
wool
the
wool
of
sheep
and
the
hair
of

were
used
very
early
in
the
world

for
clothing
and
probably
also
for

wove

them
there
is
no
reason
to
suppose
that
goats
and
sheep
preceded
the
creation
of
man
no
early
fossils
record
them
our
sheep
are
supposed
by
zoologists
to
be
descended
from
the
argali
or
ovis
ammon
of
linnæus
inhabiting
the
central
regions
of
asia
it
is
possible
that
plaited
grasses
may
have
preceded
wool
but
though
certain
prehistoric
specimens
are
supposed
to
have
been
found
in
spain
yet
of
this
there
is
but
imperfect
proof
the
pastoral
tribes
wandering
over
those
fair
regions
that
extend
from
khotan

their

how
important
a
place
these
shepherds
held
in

they
watched
the
stars

they
were

when

served
another
generation
from

account
of
the
great
variety
of
wools
remarkable
for
their
fine
texture
their
whiteness
their
blackness
or
their
redness
their
cool
or
their
warm
tints
it
is
evident
that
the
ancients
valued
highly
these
different
qualities
the
cloths
that
were
of
greatest
account
were
of
the
finest
or
the
warmest
kinds
the
sheep
of
miletus
attica
megaris
and
tarentum
were
clothed
in
jackets
in
order
to
preserve
the
fineness
and
whiteness
of
their
own
coats
and
to
protect
them
from
being
torn
by
the
thorny
bushes
in
their
pastures
columella
calls
them
the
covered
and
the
soft
and
says
they
were
often
kept
in
the
house
we
find
notices
of
the
peculiarities
of
the
various
national
breeds
caused
by
the
soil
on
which
their
pasture
grew
and
the
rivers
and
streams
at
which
they
drank
and
these
peculiarities
were
if
possible
encouraged
there
is
evidence
also
that
some
improvement
of
the
breeds
by
crossing
was
practised
in
early
times
as
in
all
the
life
of
the
greeks
the
religious
element
had
much
influence
in
perfecting
their
flocks
of
sheep
only
the
most
beautiful
animals
were
considered
worthy
of
sacrifice
to
the
gods
a
few
of
the
rare
specimens
of
stuffs
which
have
been
rescued
from
tombs
especially
in
the
crimea
and
in
the
fayoum
in
egypt
show
a
wool
so
fine
and
shining
that
it
might
be
taken
for
silk
and
the
beauty
of
the
weaving
is
marvellous
and
much
varied
in
style
a
warrior
tomb
in
the
district
of
kuban
contained
a
funeral
pall
covering
the
sarcophagus
measuring
at
least
three
metres
and
a
half
each
way
woven
of
brown
wool
in
twelve
narrow
strips
sewn
together
and
afterwards
painted

ground
is
yellowish

design
brown
the
figures
repeat
mythical
subjects
and
alternate
with
patterns
and
there
is
a
border
one
strip
contains
a
scene
from
the
story
of
peleus

apparently
this
is
attic
design
the
coloured
dresses
worn
by
women
of
rank
and
hung
on
the
statues
of
the
gods
were
sometimes
painted
sometimes
stamped
and
often
embroidered
and
they
were
nearly
all
of
woollen
fabrics
one
of
the
great
advantages
of
wool
is
its
power
of
absorbing
colour
as
the
pigment
sinks
into
its
very
fibre
instead
of
clinging
to
the
surface
it
can
be
dyed
of
deeper
colours
than
flax
cotton
or
silk
pliny
tells
us
that
tanaquil
combed
span
and
wove
her
wool
and
she
herself
made
the
royal
mantle
which
servius
tullius
used
to
wear
and
it
was
covered
with
a
wavy
pattern
undulata
thence
came
the
custom
that
when
a
maiden
became
a
bride
her
attendants
carried
a
distaff
trimmed
with
combed
wool
and
a
spindle
with
yarn
upon
it
the
robes
worked
by
tanaquil
were
dedicated
by
servius
tullius
to
the
statue
of
fortune
in
her
temple
at
rome
and
were
still
hanging
there
in
the
days
of
tiberius
pliny
remarks
that
it
was
a
wonder
that
it
neither
fell
from
the
image
nor
was
eaten
by
the
moths
during
five
hundred
and
sixty
years
he
gives
us
interesting
details
of
the
weaving
of
woollen
cloths
and
speaks
of
the
thick
coarse
wool
with
great
thick
hair
used
for
carpets
from
the
time
of
homer
the
same
passage
mentions
felt
he
tells
us
of
the
cloths
with
a
curly
nap
used
in
the
days
of
augustus
of
the
papaverata
woven
with
flowers
resembling
poppies
and
we
hear
from
him
of
the
cloth
of
divers
colours
woven
in
babylon
and
called
thence
babylonica
and
the
alexandrian
webs
with
threads
polymita
comparing
them
with
those
made
in
gaul
and
those
woven
by
the
parthians
we
have
already
said
that
the
wool
of
miletus
was
a
proverbial
favourite
with
the
greeks
eustathius
speaks
of
the
excellence
of
the
milesian

from
these

are

of

woven

in

with
combinations
of
many
colours
and
in
fact
through
this
collection
now
placed
in
the
museum
at
petersburg
we
become
aware
that
the
greeks
had
learned
all
the
secrets
of
the
art
of
weaving
wool
they
however
lost
it
and
it
is
only
in
india
that
its
continuity
was
never
broken
indian
looms
still
weave
of
the
finest
fleeces
such
shawls
of
babylonian
design
as
repeat
the
texture
of
the
ancient
greek
garments
but
were
they
greek
or
did
those
beautiful
woven
fabrics
come
from
persia
or
india
the
first
we
know
of
scandinavian
wool
for
dress
is
a
fragment
from
a
celtic
barrow
in
yorkshire

woollen
plaited
shroud
this
fabric
was
an
advance
upon
the
original
northern
savage
costume
a
fashioned
and
sewn
with
a
for
a
needle
sinews
for
thread
and
a
thorn
for
a
pin
but
we
must
imagine
that
some
use
was
made
besides
plaiting
of
the
spun
wool
of
which
the
early
northern
women
have
left
us
evidence
in
the
whorls
of
their
spindles
from
prehistoric
times
wool
has
always
appeared
to
be
a
natural
material
for
dress
it
is
warm
in
winter
light
in
summer
and
is
always
beautiful
as
it
hangs
in
lovely
soft
draperies
heavy
enough
to
draw
the
fabric
into
graceful
curved
lines
and
yet
capable
of
yielding
to
each
movement
in
little
rippling
folds
covering
but
not
concealing
the
forms
to
which
they
cling

explained

it
what
the
italians
call
the
eyes
of
the
folds
are
particularly
beautiful
in
woollens
and
lend
themselves
to
sculpturesque
art
the
other
natural
use
of
wool
is
for
carpets
we
have
the
evidence
of
the
imitations
in
mosaic
of
carpets
from
the
stone
floors
in
nineveh
now
in
the
british
museum
that
the
art
of
weaving
large
and
small
rugs
and
the
principles
of
composition
for
such
purposes
was
at
that
date
well
understood
the
traditions
of
babylon
appear
to
have
been
inherited
by
the
occupiers
of
the
soil
as
it
is
supposed
that
the
saracens
learned
from
persia
the
art
of
weaving
pile
carpets
and
imported
thence
craftsmen
into
spain
we
can
trace
persian
carpet
patterns
in
indian
floor
coverings
the
greeks
called
them
and
the
latins
adopted
the

great
part
in
the
decorations
of
our
houses
as
of
our
garments
fabrics
have
been
made
of
them
of
every
description
from
the
cheapest
and
commonest
to
the
most
refined
but
if
woollen
stuffs
are
to
be
beautiful
they
must
be
and
worked
or
embroidered
by
hand
woollens
brocaded
or
figured
are
not
so
effective
as
silken
hangings
woollen
velvets
are
without
light
dull
and
heavy
still
even
amongst
our
english
fabrics
there
have
always
been
varieties
of
texture
and
adaptations
to
different
effects
and
some
are
beautiful
worsted
thread
so
called
from
worsted
in
norfolk
where
the
materials
for
weaving
and
embroidering
are
manufactured
has
always
been
very
important
in
embroidery
worsteds
after
a
time
gave
way
to
a
very
beautiful
material
called
german
wool
which
again
has
yielded
the
supremacy
to
crewels
resembling
the
old
worsteds
these
crewels
are
nearly
the
same
in
substance
and
in
their
loose
texture
as
the
threads
prepared
from
wool
for
tapestry
weaving
we
may
claim
in
england
the
superiority
in
this
manufacture
though
we
are
constantly
receiving
from
france
novelties
which
give
us
good
hints
and
urge
us
to
keep
pace
with
the
science
of
the
gobelins
in
their
woollen
dyes
the
french
in
return
employ
our
wools
especially
those
of
lincolnshire
in
their
tapestry
workshops
the
wool
and
hair
of
goats
should
be
a
study
by
itself
they
have
from
the
earliest
times
been
used
in
india
for
the
finest
and
softest
fabrics
such
as
the
lovely
shawls
of
cashmere
and
the
neighbouring
provinces
cloth
of
tars
in
the
middle
ages
is
supposed
to
be
what
is
now
called
cashmere
flax
boyd
dawkins
tells
us
that
the
art
of
spinning
and
the
manufacture
of
linen
were
introduced
into
europe
in
the
neolithic
age
and
have
been
preserved
with
little
variation
from
that
period
to
the
present
day
in
certain
remote
parts
of
europe
having
only
been
superseded
in
modern
times
by
the
complicated
machinery
so
familiar
to
us
the
spindle
and
distaff
or
perforated
spindle
whorls
are
of
stone
pottery
or
bone
such
as
are
constantly
found
in
neolithic
tombs
and
habitations
thread
from
the
swiss
lake
cities
is
proved
to
be
of
flax
and
there
is
evidence
of
weaving
in
some
sort
of
loom
the
meaning
of
the
word
byssus
has
been
disputed
some
authorities
asserting
that
it
includes
both
flax
and
cotton
fabrics
without
the
aid
of
the
microscope
the
dispute
as
to
whether
the
material
of
the
egyptian
mummy
wrappings
was
cotton
or
flax
or
a
mixture
of
the
two
would
never
have
been
settled
but
now
that
the
difference
of
the
structure
of
each
has
been
clearly
ascertained
we
know
that
cotton
was
never
employed
in
egypt
except
for
certain
domestic
uses
the
mummy
wrappings
are
entirely
linen
cotton
was
forbidden
for
the
priests
dress
in
the
temple
though
they
might
wear
it
when
not
on
duty
there
are
specimens
of
egyptian
painted
or
printed
patterns
on
fine
linen
in
the
british
museum
and
it
is
curious
to
see
in
egyptian
mural
paintings
the
same
patterned
chintzes
on
furniture
that
were
common
a
hundred
years
ago
in
england
both
must
have
come
from
india
and
therefore
were
certainly
cotton
fabrics
herodotus
says
the
mummy
cloths
were
of
byssine
sindon
which
may
be
translated
linen
cloth
cotton
he
calls
tree
wool
yates
has
carefully
argued
the
whole
question
and
we
think
has
proved
that
byssus
was
flax
and
not
cotton
he
quotes
philo
who
certainly
must
have
believed
that
it
was
made
of
flax
from
the
description
he
gives
of
its
appearance
and
qualities
which
in
no
way
apply
to
cotton
or
hemp
he
says
that
the
jewish
high
priests
wore
a
linen
garment
of
the
purest
byssus
which
was
a
symbol
of
firmness
incorruption
and
of
the
clearest
splendour
for
fine
linen
is
very
difficult
to
tear
it
is
made
of
nothing
mortal
and
becomes
brighter
and
more
resembling
light
the
more
it
is
cleansed
by
washing
here
is
another
quotation
cloth
of
byssus
symbolizes
firm
faith
its
threads
surpass
even
ropes
of
broom
in
firmness
and
strength
pliny
says
the
flax
grown
in
egypt
was
superior
to
any
other
and
it
was
exported
to
arabia
and
india
the
first
known
existing
fragment
of
flax
linen
in
europe
was
taken
from
the
tomb
of
the
seven
brothers
in
the
crimea
its
date
is
in
solomon
time
the
jews
evidently
depended
upon
egypt
for
their
fine
linen
herodotus
describes
the
corselet
of
amasis
the
fineness
of
the
linen
and
the
embroidered
decorations
of
men
and
animals
partly
gold
and
partly
tree
wool
cotton
all
the
finest
linen
certainly
came
then
from
egypt
and
was
much
finer
than
any
that
is
now
made
that
we
call
cambric
was
woven
there
many
centuries
before
it
was
made
in
cambray
through
the
phœnicians
the
fine
linen
came
to
rome
as
appears
from
the
following
notice
of
embroidery
on
linen
by
flavius
vopiscus
in
his
life
of
the
emperor
carinus
why
should
i
mention
the
linen
cloths
brought
from
tyre
and
sidon
which
are
so
thin
as
to
be
transparent
which
glow
with
purple
or
are
prized
on
account
of
their
laborious
embroideries
the
history
of
a
fine
embroidered
linen
curtain
for
a
roman
house
might
have
been
this
grown
in
egypt
carried
to
nomenticum
artois
and
there
woven
taken
to
india
to
be
embroidered
and
thence
as
merchandise
to
rome
while
flax
was
making
its
way
northward
the
celts
must
also
have
taken
it
across
europe
from
their
after
emigrating
from
the
east
the
word
is
a
celtic
epithet
whereas
is
an
word
the
atrebates
wove
linen
in
artois
years
ago
jerome
speaks
of
their
indumenta
or
shirts
of
fine
linen
and
the
great
weavers
of
are
still
the
flemish
descendants
of
the
atrebates
their
celtic
descent
is
witnessed
in
the
irish
by
their
superiority
in
the
crafts
of
the
loom
the
fine
laces
of
venice
france
and
belgium
are
all
of
linen
flaxen
thread
clearness
and
strength
in
these
delicate
fabrics
can
not
be
obtained
with
cotton
which
especially
when
it
is
washed
swells
and
fluffs
and
never
has
the
radiant
appearance
and
purity
of
flax
embroidery
is
always
a
natural
accompaniment
of
fine
linen
those
that
are
still
preserved
to
us
from
early
and
times
are
nearly
all
on
linen
if
not
on
silk
the
woollen
fragments
are
very
few
and
imperfect
they
have
been
invariably
fretted
by
the
moth
white
needle
embroidery
is
mostly
worked
in
though
has
been
used
a
great
deal
and
is
very
fit
for
the
purpose
cotton
cotton
was
native
to
india
as
flax
was
to
egypt
it
not
only
was
grown
woven
and
printed
there
from
the
remotest
antiquity
but
was
cultivated
nowhere
else
the
egyptians
do
not
appear
to
have
grown
it
till
the
fourteenth
century
though
they
had
long
imported
it
as
raw
material
and
as
plain
and
printed
webs
it
was
called
it
was
first
woven
in
italy
in
the
thirteenth
century
and
used
for
making
paper
and
in
the
sixteenth
the
plant
was
grown
in
the
south
of
europe
from
italy
it
was
carried
into
the
low
countries
and
only
reached
england
in
the
seventeenth
century
so
lately
has
the
great
staple
of
our
manufactures
first
belonged
to
us
the
fibre
of
cotton
has
neither
the
strength
nor
the
durability
of
flax
or
silk
but
it
is
the
third
in
the
group
of
the
most
universally
qualified
materials
for
all
purposes
of
domestic
textile
art
ranging
from
carpets
and
sails
to
fine
chintzes
for
dress
and
filmy
muslins
the
cloudy
effect
of
these
delicate
fabrics
is
their
own
peculiar
beauty
muslins
for
hangings
printed
or
embroidered
have
always
been
a
luxury
from
india
they
were
called
carbasa
and
were
much
esteemed
in
rome
as
a
protection
against
the
sun
but
we
have
much
earlier
notice
of
them
as
being
the
curtains
described
in
the
book
of
esther
hung
with
silver
rings
to
the
pillars
of
marble
in
the
banqueting
hall
at
susa
or
shushan
blue
and
white
muslin
carpas
mistranslated
green
in
the
authorized
version
fastened
with
cords
of
fine
linen
and
purple
the
word
carbasina
occurs
in
a
play
by
statius
evidently
translated
from
a
writer
of
the
new
greek
comedy
period
it
may
be
inferred
therefore
that
the
greeks
used
cotton
a
century
before
nearchus
one
of
alexander
admirals
speaks
of
the
in
india
as
if
they
were
a
new
discovery
yates
gives
us
many
quotations
from
latin
classical
authors
proving
the
common
use
of
cotton
its
latin
name
was
from
hence
the
italian
the
variety
of
cotton
fabrics
in
india
is
very
numerous
each
having
its
distinctive
beauties
and
qualities
inherited
by
tradition
from
early
times
they
are
enumerated
and
described
in
sir
arts
of
india
almost
all
of
them
have
been
made
to
carry
embroideries
the
transparent
muslins
as
well
as
the
fine
cloths
and
the
stronger
and
thicker
fabrics
most
old
english
houses
contain
some
hangings
of
thickly
woven
cotton
probably
indian
worked
in
crewel
or
worsted
of
the
time
of
james
or
a
little
earlier
and
beautiful
patterns
wrought
in
silk
or
thread
on
fine
cotton
linen
reminding
one
of
the
arabesques
of
the
taj
mahal
succeeded
those
of
the
jacobean
style
transparent
muslins
were
often
embroidered
in
gold
and
silver
or
spangled
and
embossed
with
beetles
wings
and
gold
silver
and
silk
were
lavished
on
indian
cotton
grounds
as
well
as
on
silken
stuffs
linen
was
not
much
embroidered
in
india
but
often
printed
like
chintz
buckram
or
plush
of
cotton
was
certainly
imported
from
the
east
to
england
from
the
thirteenth
century
to
the
time
of
elizabeth
there
is
at
ashridge
in
hertfordshire
a
small
jacket
of
very
fine
amongst
the
baby
linen
prepared
by
elizabeth
for
the
expected
heir
of
philip
and
mary
and
there
are
other
small
dresses
of
this
material
of
the
date
of
james
i
a
similar
material
called
fustian
is
also
named
by
marco
polo
as
a
cotton
fabric
it
is
supposed
to
have
been
made
in
egypt
by
the
arabs
this
sort
of
variously
manipulated
is
repeatedly
mentioned
by
herr
in
his
catalogue
of
egyptian
textiles
from
the
fayoum
plano
carpini
says
the
tunics
of
the
tartars
were
bacramo
or
else
of
baudichin
cloth
of
gold
falstaff
men
in
buckram
may
be
thus
explained
i
have
already
said
that
cotton
is
inferior
in
its
qualities
to
silk
and
flax
except
in
the
production
of
transparent
muslins
its
peculiarity
is
its
tendency
to
crinkle
or
crumple
in
wearing
therefore
it
does
not
present
a
smooth
flat
surface
except
by
means
of
dressing
which
unfits
it
for
clinging
effects
but
suits
printed
patterns
such
stuffs
as
workhouse
sheeting
imitating
certain
fabrics
of
the
sixteenth
century
and
which
it
has
been
the
fashion
of
late
to
cover
with
embroidery
do
not
repay
by
effective
beauty
the
trouble
bestowed
upon
them
gold
a
somewhat
profane
french
writer
giving
his
ideas
on
the
creation
says
that
gold
the
latest
metal
was
expressly
created
for
the
demoralization
of
mankind
this
is
an
ugly
version
of
the
fact
that
it
is
found
on
the
surface
of
the
earth
crust
and
that
its
beauty
and
worth
makes
it
a
desirable
possession
for
which
men
will
ever
contend
gold
adorns
every
work
of
the
artistic
animal
man
it
is
the
most
becoming
setting
to
all
other
beautiful
things
the
most
gorgeous
reflection
of
light
and
colour
the
richest
and
softest
background
the
most
harmonious
medium
for
high
lights
in
all
works
of
decoration
it
represents
sunshine
where
it
is
not
and
doubles
it
where
it
is
the
word
illumination
in
books
belongs
to
the
gilded
illustrations
of
immortal
thoughts
in
embroideries
as
grounding
or
as
pattern
gold
gives
the
glory
her
clothing
is
of
wrought
gold
the
raiment
of
needlework
is
comparatively
ineffective
without
golden
lights
or
background
as
colour
it
never
can
offend
the
eye
except
when
used
to
accentuate
aggressively
a
vulgar
pattern
or
when
it
flashes
and
dazzles
from
and
too
lavish
expenditure
silver
follows
gold
as
a
splendid
element
in
decoration
but
it
is
not
of
such
universal
application
and
use
and
when
employed
together
the
proportion
of
gold
should
preponderate
golden
tissues
belong
to
the
earliest
civilizations
sir
birdwood
says
that
the
art
of
gold
brocades
is
older
than
the
code
of
manu
the
excellence
of
the
art
passed
in
the
long
course
of
ages
from
one
place
to
another
and
babylon
tarsus
alexandria
baghdad
damascus
antioch
tabriz
sicily
and
tripoli
successively
became
celebrated
for
their
gold
and
tissues
silks
and
brocades
through
every
disguise
and
mingling
of
style
it
is
not
impossible
to
infer
the
essential
identity
of
the
brocades
with
the
fabrics
of
blue
purple
and
scarlet
worked
in
gold
of
ancient
babylonian
art
the
israelites
wove
gold
with
their
coloured
woollens
for
the
use
of
the
sanctuary
and
probably
brought
the
art
from
egypt
though
i
am
not
aware
of
any
stuffs
from
egyptian
tombs
indian
and
chinese
stuffs
were
from
time
immemorial
woven
with
gold
the
historians
of
alexander
the
great
continually
name
gold
as
a
material
in
dress
arrian
justin
and
quintus
curtius
all
speak
of
golden
tissues
as
part
of
the
luxury
of
the
east
we
hear
of
darius
dress
woven
with
golden
hawks
and
of
the
golden
spoils
of
persepolis
the
dresses
worn
by
alexander
generals
and
all
his
attendants
clothed
in
purple
and
gold
then
perhaps
the
babylonian
tradition
was
brought
to
europe
and
ever
after
purple
and
gold
became
the
state
apparel
for
courtiers
as
well
as
kings
the
hangings
of
scarlet
purple
and
gold
used
at
the
nuptials
of
alexander
and
at
his
funeral
and
his
pall
of
the
same
material
point
to
the
fact
that
gold
was
a
recognized
element
in
splendid
textile
weaving
as
well
as
in
the
earliest
ornamental
embroideries
attalus
king
of
pergamus
was
credited
with
being
the
inventor
of
gold
weaving
but
this
must
have
been
a
mistake
as
it
was
practised
long
before
his
time
but
he
may
have
devised
some
splendid
golden
tissues
which
were
called
attalic
in
honour
of
the
patronage
as
however
the
gold
flat
plate
or
wire
was
probably
that
woven
before
his
time
it
is
possible
that
he
may
have
invented
or
patronized
the
making
of
thread
of
gold
by
twining
it
round
flax
or
cotton
pliny
says
gold
may
be
woven
or
spun
like
wool
without
any
admixture
of
wool
or
flax
and
he
quotes
as
examples
the
golden
garment
of
agrippina
and
that
worn
by
tarquinius
priscus
mentioned
by
verrius
it
appears
that
the
egyptians
knew
the
art
of
drawing
gold
wire
as
some
pieces
have
been
found
in
their
jewellery
but
we
know
not
by
what
process
it
was
worked
either
then
or
in
the
dark
ages
a
mechanic
of
nuremberg
in
the
fourteenth
century
invented
a
machine
for
the
purpose
and
this
art
of
drawing
wire
was
introduced
into
england
years
later
in
the
pure
cut
gold
was
in
use
in
rome
to
a
late
date
cecilia
martyred
was
buried
with
her
golden
mantle
lying
at
her
feet
and
in
when
pope
pascal
opened
her
grave
he
found
the
evidence
of
her
martyrdom
in
that
splendid
garment
showing
that
it
had
been
soaked
in
blood
there
were
found
under
the
foundations
of
the
new
basilica
of
peter
the
bodies
of
probus
anicius
and
his
wife
proba
faltonia
in
a
wrapping
of
gold
rock
gives
us
more
examples
but
we
will
only
add
that
of
the
wife
of
the
emperor
honorius
who
in
the
year
was
buried
in
a
golden
dress
which
in
was
removed
from
her
grave
and
being
melted
weighed
lbs
the
tomb
opened
at
chessell
down
in
the
isle
of
wight
contained
fragments
of
a
garment
or
wrapping
woven
with
flat
gold
plate
these
remains
are
now
in
the
british
museum
childeric
was
buried
at
tournai
and
his
dress
of
strips
of
pure
gold

preciously
inwoven

was
remarkable
for
the
lightness

was
woven

besides

was
another

in

of

who
brought

our

imported

purl

into

lengths
threaded
on

were
often
enriched
with

fabric
sometimes
the
wire
was
twisted
with

silks
before
it
was
coiled
there
are
beautiful
specimens
of
this
work
of
the
days
of
queen
elizabeth
still
throughout
europe
the
best
works
were
carried
out
with
the
best
materials
and
these
always
came
from
the
east
but
we
sometimes
find
that
the
pressure
of
circumstances
has
for
a
time
caused
the
employment
of
adulterated
metals
that
have
perished
and
thus
many
fine
works
of
art
have
been
spoiled
the
use
of
bad
materials
has
therefore
been
as
unfortunate
for
art
as
that
of
pure
gold
which
has
tempted
so
many
ignorant
persons
to
burn
golden
embroideries
and
tapestries
and
melt
down
the
ore
they
contain
how
little
of
all
that
human
skill
and
invention
have
carefully
elaborated
is
now
preserved
to
us
to
gold
and
silver
textiles
their
materials
have
been
often
a
fatal
dower
it
has
sometimes
puzzled
any
but
the
most
experienced
embroiderers
to
distinguish
between
the
stuffs
woven
with
the
golden
threads
on
the
surface
and
finely
brocaded
or
patterned
in
the
loom
and
those
other
cloths
embroidered
by
hand
which
have
been
so
manipulated
that
hardly
an
atom
of
the
gold
can
be
detected
at
the
back
this
is
done
by
a
technical
mode
of
treating
the
surface
which
is
more
easily
shown
than
described
the
gold
is
really
drawn
into
the
spaces
between
the
threads
of
the
canvas
or
linen
grounding
but
never
pulled
through
for
many
reasons
this
is
an
advantage
and
when
executed
cunningly
as
it
was
in
england
in
the
twelfth
century
it
is
rich
beautiful
lasting
and
economical
it
is
a
peculiar
mark
of
the
opus
anglicanum
and
it
is
to
be
seen
in
the
mitre
at
munich
where
this
stitch
is
employed
on
a
white
satin
ground
also
in
the
working
of
the
two
pluvials
at
san
giovanni

at
rome
and

at

as
well
as

at

i
can
not
close
this
chapter
without
naming
the
many
schools
of
gold
embroidery
in
belgium
france
germany
italy
and
spain
the
king
of
bavaria
has
an
establishment
for
gold
work
and
this
is
very
finely
carried
out
highly
raised
and
richly
designed
in
spain
there
is
also
a
royal
school
where
stately
works
are
executed
it
is
to
be
regretted
that
the
modern
designs
are
motiveless
and
not
so
beautiful
as
the
old
ones
and
it
is
very
difficult
to
have
any
ancient
piece
of
work
copied
exactly
little
modernisms
creep
in
wherever
the
pattern
has
to
be
fitted
into
a
new
shape
for
the
accomplished
needlewoman
is
seldom
an
artist
all
honour
is
due
to
certain
manufacturers
at
lyons
who
are
working
in
the
spirit
of
the
old
masters
and
have
been
seriously
considering
how
best
to
reproduce
the
beautiful
soft
surface
of
the
gold
thread
of
which
the
secret
was
lost
in
the
fifteenth
century
the
old
chinese
flat
gold
was
about
the
sixteenth
century
superseded
by
what
was
manufactured
in
spain
and
is
no
longer
imported
or
perhaps
even
made
silk
the
origin
and
history
of
silk
is
learnedly
and
elaborately
discussed
in
yates

he
gives
us
his
authorities
and
literal
translations
for
the
benefit
of
the
unlearned
who
can
not
read
the
original
texts
i
have
availed
myself
without
hesitation
of
his
quotations
and
of
the
carefully
considered
opinions
he
has
drawn
from
them
it
has
been
already
said
that
wool
and
flax
preceded
silk
in
egyptian
greek
and
roman
manufactures
there
is
no
certain
mention
of
silk
in
the
books
of
the
old
testament
silk
is
however
named
in
the
code
of
manu
no
shred
of
silk
has
been
found
in
any
egyptian
tomb
nor
till
lately
and
with
one
exception
only
in
those
of
the
greeks

probably
raw

from

by
some
supposed
to
have
effilèd

woven
them
again
into
gauzy

yates
suggests
that
it
is
possible
that
pamphile
obtained
cocoons
and
unwound
them
as
the
passage
in
aristotle
may
be
so
interpreted
the
specimen
of
early
which
we
have
above
alluded
to
was
taken
out
of
the
tomb
of
the
seven
brothers
at
kertch
in
the
crimea
and
is
of
the
third
century
it
consists
of
several
bits
of
very
transparent
painted
silk
these
fragments
are
an
actual
and
yet
a
contemporary
witness
to
the
truth
of
the
tradition
of
coan
webs
which
are
of
the

date
possibly
they
were

whether
pamphile
silk
gauzes
were
the
only
fine

of
cos
is
a
disputed
question
she
has
the
credit
of
being
the
first
to
clothe
victorious
generals
in
triumphal
garments
and
she
has
been
immortalized
by
her
cleverness
and
industry
both
aristotle
and
pliny
assert
that
she
first
invented
the
coan
webs
and
that
some
of
them
were
of
silk
is
undoubted
the
question
is
how
came
it
there
whence
and
by
what
route
and
what
country
was
its
original
home
and
birthplace
after
stating
the
and
of
the
question
how
and
where
did
silk
first
make
its
appearance
sir
birdwood
concludes
that
both
the
worm
and
the
cocoon
were
known
to
the
greeks
and
romans
by
report
and
rare
specimens
from
the
time
of
alexander

from
his
indian
campaign
of

the
remains
of
these
fabrics
are
extremely
scarce
and
in

only
two
are
at
present
known
to
me
besides
the
kertch
specimen
the
first
is
given
in
semper
der
stil
and
is
evidently
classical
greek
or
roman
but
the
silk
material
might
have
been
effilèd
from
an
oriental
stuff
pl
no
the
second
must
have
been
originally
a
roman
pattern
modified
by
the
persian
loom
in
which
it
was
woven
this
may
have
been
a
roman
triumphal
robe
of
the
date
of
julius
cæsar
pl
no
it
is
clear
that
chinese
silken
stuffs
were
not
generally
known
in
southern
europe
till
the
time
of
julius
cæsar
who
displayed
a
profusion
of
silks
in
some
of
his
splendid
theatrical
representations
how
silk
first
arrived
from
the
east
is
disputed
some
say
it
came
by
the
red
sea
and
other
authorities
believe
it
was
brought
from
china
persia
by
land
but
it
is
not
necessary
that
it
should
have
entered
our
civilization
by
only
one
gate
the
periplus
maris
erythræi
makes
frequent
mention
of
the
trade
in
silks
through
india
by
the
indus
to
the
coasts
of
the
erythrean
sea
they
were
also
brought
through
bactria
to
barygaza
near
surat
from
a
city
called
thina
china
the
author
of
the
periplus
of
course
refers
to
some
place
in
the
country
vaguely
called
serica
that
the
trade
which
brought
it
into
europe
was
difficult
and
limited
is
proved
by
the
fact
that
silk
continued
even
as
late
as
the
third
century
of
our
era
to
be
an
article
of
luxury
of
which
the
manufacture
and
use
continued
to
be
the
subject
of
legal
enactments
and
restrictions
for
years
after
pamphile
first
essay
in
in
the
seres
was
the
name
given
by
the
ancients
to
the
nation
which
produced
silk
and
it
was
undoubtedly
that
accepted
for
the
distant
region
now
called
china
including
corea
and
later
the
kingdom
of
khotan
the
first
mention
of
these
people
as
a
distinct
nation
is
by
mela
iii
who
speaks
of
them
as
an
honest
people
who
bring
what
they
have
to
sell
and
return
for
their
payments
the
prevailing
idea
amongst
the
greeks
was
that
silk
was
combed
from
the
trees
seneca
says
nor
with
mæonian
needle
mark
the
web
gathered
by
eastern
seres
from
the
trees
seneca
the
tragedian
herc
ætæus
this
was
till
lately
believed
to
be
only
a
fiction
intended
to
hide
the
truth
and
enhance
the
value
of
the
new
coan
material
but
it
is
now
ascertained
that
some
of
the
wild
silk
in
china
is
carried
by
the
silkworm
round
the
trees
wrapping
them
up
as
it
were
in
large
untidy
cocoons
so
that
as
usual
tradition
had
truth
for
its
foundation
there
was
always
much
mysterious
report
about
the
new
material
dionysius
periegetes
tells
of
a
barbarous
people
called
the
seres
who
renounce
the
care
of
sheep
and
oxen
but
who
comb
the
coloured
flowers
of
the
desert
and
with
them
produce
woven
precious
stuffs
of
which
they
make
figured
garments
resembling
the
flowers
of
the
field
in
beauty
and
in
texture
the
web
of
the
spider
there
is
no
doubt
that
as
egypt
was
the
first
to
weave
linen
and
india
to
produce
cotton
textiles
so
in
china
originated
the
material
of
silk
and
its
manufacture
terrien
de
la
couperie
who
has
deciphered
the
archaic
books
of
the
chinese
records
sees
there
excellent
linguistic
proofs
that
the
chinese
nation
was
originally
a
fragment
of
the
first
babylonian
civilization
he
there
finds
that
when
these
accadians
arrived
on
the
furthest
eastern
coast
of
asia
they
met
with
and
enslaved
an
aboriginal
race
who
already
cultivated
the
silkworm
and
wove
and
worked
its
produce
and
were
called
by
them
the
embroiderers
this
is
supposed
to
have
been
an
historical
event
contemporary
with
the
life
of
abraham
and
therefore
years
old

his
children
in
painting
sculpture
and
embroidery
and
in
the
art
of
preparing
for
different
woven
fabrics
whether
we
are
justified
or
not
in
believing
in
so
very
early
a
date
at
any
rate
we
must
remember
that
it
is
now
ascertained
that
silk
was
used
in
china
years
before
our
era
auberville
says
there
is
a
legend
that
the
empress
had
the
happy
inspiration
to
invent
the
unwinding
of
the
cocoon
before
the
insect
cut
the
threads
and
for
this
discovery
she
was
placed
among
the
divinities
before
her
time
they
had
certainly
for
more
than
years
used
the
precious
material
in
its
mutilated
condition
some
centuries
later
the
emperor
chan
received
tribute
in
linens
and
silken
stuffs
tissues
of
many
colours
were
painted
or
richly
embroidered
in
the
second
century
a
prince
of
khotan
was
desirous
of
obtaining
from
china
the
eggs
of
the
silkworm
but
his
request
was
refused
and
it
was
prohibited
that
either
eggs
of
the
silkworm
or
seed
of
should
cross
the
border
then
the
king
of
khotan
asked
for
a
chinese
princess
in
marriage
and
this
favour
being
granted
he
found
means
to
inform
the
lady
privately
that
in
her
future
kingdom
she
would
find
no
silk
to
weave
or
work
the
dread
of
such
an
aimless
life
roused
all
her
womanly
instincts
defiance
of
the
law
love
of
smuggling
and
the
wish
to
please
her
husband
and
benefit
her
future
people
gave
her
courage
to
conceal
the
eggs
and
seeds
in
the
folds
of
her
dress
and
the
meshes
of
her
beautiful
hair
and
so
she
carried
a
most
precious
dower
into
her
adopted
country
thus
was
broken
the
spell
which
for
more
than
years
had
confined
the
secret
of
china
within
the
fence
of
its
wonderful
wall
and
later
on
the
eggs
were
brought
to
byzantium
from
china
therefore
comes
our
silk
we
may
say
it
is
traced
to
the
beginning
but
how
far
back
had
the
archæologist
to
grope
before
he
could
find
it

pliny
account

founded

the
latin
poets
of
the
augustan
age
speak
of
silk
attire
with
other
luxurious
customs
from
the
east
the
roman
senate
in
the
reign
of
tiberius
decreed
that
only
women
should
wear
silk
on
account
of
its
effeminacy
silk
was
accumulated
for
the
wardrobes
of
the
empresses
till
when
marcus
aurelius
the
philosopher
sold
all
the
imperial
ornaments
and
the
silken
robes
of
his
empress
by
auction
in
the
forum
of
trajan
we
learn
that
silk
was
precious
and
fabulously
esteemed
to
the
end
of
the
second
century
but
it
is
seldom
mentioned
in
the
third
century
ælius
lampridius
speaks
of
a
silken
cord
with
which
to
hang
himself
as
an
imperial
extravagance
on
the
part
of
heliogabalus
and
of
this
only
one
strand
was
silk
and
he
mentions
that
alexander
severus
rarely
allowed
himself
a
dress
of
silk
holosericum
and
only
gave
away
robes
of
partly
silken
substance
flavius
vopiscus
says
that
aurelian
had
no
dress
wholly
of
silk
holosericum
his
wife
begged
him
to
allow
her
a
shawl
of
purple
silk
and
he
replied
far
be
it
from
me
to
permit
thread
to
be
reckoned
worth
its
weight
in
gold
for
a
pound
of
gold
was
then
worth
a
pound
of
silk
flavius
vopiscus
further
states
that
the
emperor
carinus
however
gave
away
silken
garments
as
well
as
dresses
of
gold
and
silver
to
greek
artificers
players
wrestlers
and
musicians
yates
gives
us
a
translation
of
an
edict
of
diocletian
giving
a
maximum
of
prices
for
articles
in
common
use
in
the
roman
empire
it
reads
like
a
tailor
or
a
bill
of
denarii
to
the
tailor
for
lining
a
fine
vest
to
the
same
for
an
opening
of

of

the

at

by
poculus
silk
manufacturer
this
was
probably
an
imperial
office
in
the
fourth
century
from
the
first
to
the
sixth
centuries
poets
and
historians
continually
speak
of
silk
praising
its
beauty
or
blaming
it
as
extravagance
or
luxury
but
according
to
yates
all
the
information
we
collect
from
these
sources
requires
to
be
tested
as
to
accuracy
and
is
often
erroneous
i
have
spoken
of
the

in
cos
the
first
arrival
of
the
silkworm
in
europe
was
in
the
sixth
century
years
later
cosmas
indicopleustes
and
another
monk
brought
eggs
from
china
in
the
hollow
staves
they
carried
in
their
hands
this
was
a
great
event
in
european
commerce
the
eggs
were
solemnly
presented
to
the
emperor
justinian
and
the
monopoly
of
their
cultivation
is
to
be
found
in
his
codex
the
monopoly
of
the
silk
manufactures
was
confined
to
the
area
of
the
imperial
palace
of
constantinople
but
the
cultivation
of
the
worm
gradually
spread
over
greece
asia
minor
and
india
the
first

the
use
of

auberville
gives
us
in
his
tissus
specimens
of
roman
silks
between
the
first
and
seventh
centuries
but
he
can
not
fix
their
exact
date
the
finest
webs
of
holosericum
from
the
imperial
looms
were
generally
bestowed
upon
the
church
and
thus
consecrated
the
earliest
ascertained
specimens
that
have
survived
have
been
preserved
and
of
these
most
have
been
found
in
the
tombs
of
saints
bishops
and
kings
who
were
buried
in
priestly
as
well
as
in
royal
garments
among
the
silk
and
satin
fabrics
the
tissue
called
imperial
is
mentioned
by
several
early
english
authors
roger
de
wendover

matthew

the
apparition
of

john
as
clad
in

in
a

in
the
eastern

this
industry
after
a
time
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
jews
and
in
benjamin

the

to
have

which
absorbed
all
the

the

in

carried
on
the
weaving
of

and
flowered

and
lastly

was
from

that
proceeded

real
works
of

precious
stones
the
highest
efforts
of
the

were
apparently
finished

the
needle

in

textiles
of
egypt
the
continuity
of
sicilian
textile
designs
from
the
sixth
to
the
sixteenth
centuries
a
thousand
years
is
very
remarkable
owing
to
its
originally
strongly
stamped
oriental
character
great
knowledge
of
the
arts
of
weaving
spinning
and
dyeing
silk
is
required
to
enable
any
one
to
assign
an
exact
date
to
materials
which
only
remodelled
their
style
three
times
rock
rules
for
deciphering
these
three
dates
may
however
be
easily
learned
as
they
are
broad
and
simple
in
his
comprehensive
introduction
to
the
textiles
in
the
kensington
museum
lxvii
he
says
that
the
three
defined
periods
of
in
sicily
are
first
from
the
time
of
justinian
to
the
hohenstaufen
from
the
sixth
to
the
twelfth
century
secondly
from
the
accession
of
frederick
i
barbarossa
to
charles
twelfth
to
fourteenth
centuries
the
third
period
is
of
one
century
only
from
to
the
first
period
especially
shows
african
animals
such
as
the
giraffe
and
the
different
kinds
of
antelopes
mixed
with
arabian
mottoes

the

from

the
fresh
designs
show
fragments
of
greek
taste
such
as
masks
and
foliage

give
one
a
slight
foretaste
of
the
renaissance
these
echoes
are
contemporary
in
the
sicilian
looms
with
such
norman
motives
as
a
crowned
sovereign
riding
with
a
hawk
upon
his
wrist
this
description
singularly
applies
to
the
relics
removed
from
the
tomb
of
cuthbert
at
durham
in
among
which
are
fragments
of
three
wrappings
or
garments
of
silk
so
suggestive
of
the
artistic
traditions
of
many
nationalities
and
the
long
descent
of
patterns
recognizable
after
the
lapse
of
centuries
that
a
description
of
them
accompanied
by
illustrations
can
hardly
fail
to
be
interesting
they
are
all
now
reduced
by
time
to
a
rich
golden
brown
though
there
are
indications
that
blue
green
and
red
have
been
woven
into
their
fabric
and
there
are
also
on
one
of
them
traces
of
gilding
the
first
plate
shows
oriental
conventional
peacocks
and
collared
framed
within
circles
which
slightly
intersect
each
other
thus
giving
the
opportunity
for
varying
the
original
motive
by
breaking
up
the
rolling
arabesqued
pattern
and
uniting
the
stems
and
flowers
contained
in
the
border
the
spaces
between
the
circles
are
filled
in
with
gryphons
in
pairs
of
the
babylonian
stamp
thick
limbed
with
muscles
there
is
a
border
or
guimp
persian
in
character
in
which
are
small
crosses
surmounting
repetitions
of
the
crenelated
pattern
found
in
assyrian
ornament
the
second
piece
of
silk
contains
a
large
rosace
scattered
about
it
are
repetitions
of
the
persian
leaf
or
tree
of
life
and
the
border
consists
of
kneeling
hares
or
fawns
between
a
persian
arabesque
and
a
corded
line
the
mixture
of
egyptian
and
assyrian
styles
is
remarkable
throughout
till
we
come
to
the
centre
of
the
rosace
where
we
find
a
most
incongruous
man
in
armour
on
horseback
with
a
hawk
on
his
wrist
giving
the
norman
stamp
of
the
reigning
house
and
influence
in
sicily

central
subject
is
exactly
repeated
on
an
embroidered
twelfth
century
chasuble

that
a
royal
crown

pl
the
third
specimen
is
the
most
noteworthy
plate
there
is
nothing
of
assyrian
here
but
it
reminds
one
of
egyptian
and
greek
art
and
at
once
suggests
count
roger
greek
slaves
at
the
sicilian
looms
but
the
design
is
probably
of
a
much
earlier
date
and
the
subject

the
lower
part
of

somewhat
like
a

towards
it

palermo

the

the
designs
are
of
a
wonderful
richness
and
capricious
ingenuity
they
show
alike
asiatic
african
and
european
animals
and
every
kind
of
mythological
creature
griffins
dragons
dogs
and

single

beautifully
drawn
foliage

flowers
and
heraldic
emblems
and
one
peculiarity
of
the
third
period
is
the
frequent
use
of
green
patterns
on
murrey
grounds
all
this
splendour
of
design
was
commonly
lavished
on
poor
material
the
silks
continued
to
be
mixed
with
cotton
and
the
gold
or
rather
the
gilding
was
so
base
that
it
has
almost
always
become
black

or

the
heraldic
silks
are
mostly
of
the
time
of
the
crusades
when
the
distinguished
pilgrims
and
warriors
especially
the
english
made
sicily
their
house
to
the
holy
land
and
brought
from
thence
fabrics
woven
to
suit
their
tastes
in
auberville
book
we
find
under
the
dates
of
many
centuries
the
most
remarkable
fragments
now
known
on
and
in
some
very
ancient
pictures
are
figured
beautiful
silks
woven
in
gold
which
are
recognizable
at
once
by
their
style
of
this
type
the
remarkable
fragment
of
the
dress
of
richard
in
the
kensington
museum
dates
itself
by
carrying
the
cognizances
of
his
grandfather
and
his
mother
and
the
portrait
of
his
dog
math
the
last
period
of
the
sicilian
silks
is
especially
marked
by
the
inscriptions
being
mostly
nonsense
and
only
woven
in
as
ornament
with
the
forms
of
arab
lettering
sir
birdwood
says
that
whether
the
saracens
found
the
manufacture
of
silk
already
established
in
india
or
not
they
certainly
influenced
the
decorative
designs
he
adds
that
kincobs
are
now
woven
at
ahmedabad
and
benares
identical
in
design
with
the
old
sicilian
brocades
while
the
saracenic
sicilian
silks
abound
in
patterns
which
prove
their
origin
in
assyrian
sassanian
or
indian
art
we
know
that
the
saracens
introduced
colonies
of
persian
and
probably
indian
workmen
into
spain
after
the
beginning
of
the
ninth
century
to
assist
them
in
their
architecture
and
textile

the
flourishing
of
lucca
having
been
ejected
from

carried

even
to

italian
weavers
went

so
started
the

employment
to
about

and
workpeople
of
both

the
moors
when
they
overflowed
into
iberia
carried
with
them
all
their
orientalisms
traditions
manufactures
and
designs
thus
disobeying
their
prophet
who
forbade
the
use
of
silk
except
to

senhor

tells
us
that
from
the
ninth
to
the
eleventh
centuries
spain
was
producing
fine
silk
tissues
the
moorish
cordovese
writer
who
lived
in
the
beginning
of
the
thirteenth
century
says
malaga
is
famous
for
its
manufactures
of
silks
of
all
colours
and
patterns
some
of
which
are
so
rich
that
a
suit
made
of
them
will
cost
many
thousands
such
are
the
brocades
with
beautiful
designs
and
the
names
of
the
caliphs
ameers
and
other
wealthy
people
woven
into
them
the
same
author
speaking
of
the
manufactures
of

at
almeria
says
that
thence
came
the
brightest

and
adds
a

the
rich

with
inscriptions
inwoven
in
gold
in
the
middle
ages
were
called
literatis
the
designs
of
lucca
at
first
imitated
the
moorish
sicilian
type
and
introduced
as
their
speciality
white
figures
such
as
angels
in
white
garments
and
exchanged
the
oriental
intricate
patterns
for
a
bolder
and
simpler
style
venice
of
course
also
showed
at
first
the
oriental
impress
but
she
soon
struck
out
a
line
of
her
own
and
her
especial
invention
was
shown
in
weaving
from
the
thirteenth
to
the
sixteenth
centuries
square
pieces
of
silken
tissue
representing
sacred
subjects
florentine
tissues
especially
their
velvet
and
gold
brocades
were
particularly
splendid
and
can
be
recognized
by
the
loops
of
gold
thread
drawn
to
the
surface
and
left
there
of
these
early
florentine
gold
brocades
we
have
still
beautiful
examples
in
the
palls
of
our
city
companies
and
in
ancient
ecclesiastical
vestments
the
loops
of
gold
have
been
the
custom
since
the
thirteenth
century
and
still
prevail
in
certain
traditional
fabrics
for
instance
in
the
banners
woven
annually
for
the
prizes
at
the
horse
races
in
florence
the
corsini
family
who
have
for
many
generations
and
for
hundreds
of
years
competed
in
these
races
had
in
their
princely
palace
at
rome
a
room
entirely
hung
with
the
silk
of
these
gorgeous
banners
in
hungary
queen
gisela
in
the
eleventh
century
established
looms
for
weaving
silk
and
many
convents
throughout
europe
and
in
england
wove
silken
tissues
for
the
service
of
the
church
till
the
great
manufactures
absorbed
these
partially
private
enterprises
individual
exertion
produced
copies
or
motives
that
are
taken
from
eastern
southern
or
northern
inspirations
but
it
is
only
in
large
national
schools
of
arts
or
crafts
that
an
absolutely
recognizable
style
becomes
apparent
for
example
the
early
french
silks
from
monastic
establishments
are
not
remarkable
for
either
style
or
texture
till
the
sixteenth
century
when
they
came
to
the
front
as
a
national
manufacture
and
have
held
the
highest
place
in
ever
since
the
flemish
towns
of
ypres
ghent
and
mechlin
were
known
for
their
silken
webs
in
the
thirteenth
century
and
at
that
time
innumerable
small
schools
of
the
craft
seem
to
have
covered
europe

are
constantly

with
the
colour
of
the
cochineal
insect
blatta

dye
was
invariably
used

can
not

which

named
from

in

where

all

is
absorbed

there
are
no

from

were
velvets
and
the
earliest
existing
specimen
we
know
of
is
named
by
bock
as
being
in
the
pergament
codex
at
le
puy
in
vendôme
where
amongst
other
curious
interleaved
specimens
of
weaving
is
a
fine
piece
of
shorn
silk
velvet
marco
polo
in
the
thirteenth
century
frequently
speaks
of
velvet
as
an
asiatic
fabric
it
is
first
known
as
a
european
textile
in
lucca
about
and
we
may
therefore
say
that
it
was
imported
from
the
east
in
the
next
chapter
on
colour
i
have
noticed
the
curious
fact
that
the
word
purple
was
sometimes
used
to
mean
colour
and
sometimes
to
express
the
texture
of
velvet
thus
confounding
the
two
but
i
have
also
pointed
out
that
it
had
other
meanings
and
had
become
a
very
comprehensive
word
for
everything
that
expressed
richness
and
warmth
while
examining
and
judging
embroideries
we
must
be
careful
not
to
be
deceived
by
the
different
dates
often
occurring
in
the
grounding
and
the
applied
materials
much
embroidery
was
worked
on
fabrics
that
were
already
old
and
even
worn
out
and
others
have
been
transferred
centuries
ago
and
perhaps
more
than
once
to
fresh
grounds
this
sometimes
causes
a
good
deal
of
difficulty
in
dating
specimens
one
should
begin
by
ascertaining
whether
the
needlework
was
originally
intended
to
be
cut
out
and
so
laid
on
a
ground
of
another
material
and
worked
down
and
finished
there
of
course
it
is
always
evident
and
easily
ascertained
whether
the
work
has
been
transferred
at
all
if
so
and
from
each
succeeding
transference
small
fragments
may
be
found
showing
on
the
cut
edges
you
will
often
see
remains
of
two
or
more
of
these
layers
reminding
you
of
the
three
trojan
cities
dug
up
at
different
depths
under
each
other
at
hissarlik
in
judging
each
specimen
the
acumen
of
the
expert
is
needed
to
obtain
a
correct
opinion
and
he
should
not
only
be
an
archæologist
but
a
botanist
and
a
herald
besides
and
in
fact
no
kind
of
knowledge
is
useless
in
deciphering
the
secrets
of
human
art
but
even
when
so
armed
he
is
often
checked
and
puzzled
by
some
accidental
caprice
of
design
or
mode
of
weaving
and
after
wasting
trouble
and
time
has
to
cast
it
aside
as
defying
classification
it
is
however
as
well
to
note
these
exceptions
as
when
compared
they
sometimes
explain
each
other
what
i
have
said
regards
of
course
the
historical
and
archæological
side
of
the
study
of
textiles
and
i
have
treated
of
them
as
being
either
the
origin
or
the
imitations
of
different
styles
of
embroidery
and
so
inseparably
connected
with
the
art
which
is
the
subject
and
motive
of
this
book
and
not
only
in
this
does
the
connection
between
them
exist
but
in
the
fact
that
as
embroideries
always
need
a
ground
silken
and
other
textiles
are
an
absolute
necessity
to
their
existence
for
these
reasons
alone
i
have
given
this
chapter
on
materials
short
and
imperfect
but
suggesting
further
research
into
the
writings
of
the
authors
i
have
quoted

i
hope
exciting
the
interest
of
the

the
appearance
of

this
rough
bark
is
probably
the
reason
that
it
absorbs
colour
into
its
substance
perhaps
under
the
scales
and
it

also
account
for
its
being
capable

it
may
be
laid
down
as
a
fundamental
rule
in
technical
style
that
the
product
shall
preserve
the
peculiar
characteristics
of
the
raw
material
unfortunately
the
artist
is
often
ignorant
of
the
qualities
of
the

for
which
he
is

the

has

carry

the

of

and

i
will
adhere
as
closely
as
i
can
to
this
part
of
what
is
a
great
and
most
interesting
subject
one
which
the
science
of
has
opened
out
and
by
the
test
of
experiment
cleared
of
erroneous
theories
revealing
to
us
all
its
beauty
and
fitness
for
the
use
and
delight
of
man
as
through
all
ages
the
eye
has
been
gradually
educated
to
appreciate
in
colour
so
that
is
what
errs
against
harmony
hurts
us
without
apparently
a
sufficient
reason
and
we
have
to
seek
the
causes
of
our
sensations
in
the
scientific
works
and
lectures
of
professor
tyndall
and
others
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
appreciation
of
colour
has
belonged
in
different
degrees
to
the
eye
of
every
animal
but
especially
to
that
of
man
ever
since
light
first
painted
the
flowers
of
the
field
the
eye
is
created
to
see
colour
as
well
as
form
but
we
know
that
men
being
accustomed
to
acquiesce
in
the
powers
with
which
they
find
themselves
gifted
by
nature
enjoy
and
use
them
long
before
they
begin
to
study
classify
and
name
them
when
we
recollect
that
the
circulation
of
the
blood
was
not
known
within
the
last
three
hundred
years
and
that
albert
dürer
painted
the
skeleton
death
on
the
bridge
of
lucerne
with
one
bone
in
the
upper
and
one
in
the
lower
arm
we
shall
be
surprised
to
find
that
the
ancients
had
named
the
colours
they
saw
with
some
degree
of
descriptive
and
scientific
precision
the
word
purple
for
instance
covered
a
multitude
of
tints
which
had
not
as
yet
been
differentiated
either
in
common
parlance
or
in
poetry
though
as
articles
of
commerce
the
purple
tints
had
been
early
distinguished
what
names
have
we
now
in
this
present
advanced
day
for
defining
tastes
or
smells
we
say
that
something
smells
like
a
violet
or
a
rose
or
a
sea
breeze
or
a
frosted
cabbage
we
say
a
smell
is
nice
or
nasty
that
a
taste
is
delicious
or
nauseous
but
beyond
calling
it
sweet
or
sour
we
have
no
descriptive
words
for
either
smells
or
tastes
whereas
the
nations
who
traded
in
the
materials
for
dyes
exchanged
their
nomenclatures
which
we
can
recognize
from
the
descriptive
remarks
of
different
authors
colour
as
an
art
was
born
in
those
lands
which
cluster
round
the
eastern
shores
of
the
mediterranean
the
northern
coasts
of
syria
and
arabia
and
the
isles
of
greece
all
art
grew
in
that
area
and
all
its
adjuncts
and
materials
there
came
to
perfection
though
often
imported
from
more
southern
and
eastern
sources
curtius
says
that
the
science
of
colour
came
into
europe
with
the
phœnicians
and
accompanied
the
worship
of
astarte
this
of
course
applies
to
artistic
textiles
as
the
greeks
had
already
acquired
the
art
of
dyeing
for
plain
weaving
numa
in
his
regulations
for
necessary
weaving
refers
also
to
colour
the
italians
therefore
must
at
that
time
have
made
some
advance
in
the
art
especially
the
etruscans
the
infinity
of
variation
in
colour
is
difficult
to
imagine
the
chemists
of
the
gobelins
have
fixed
and
catalogued
tones
besides
we
must
not
forget
that
it
is
now
all
but
ascertained
that
the
same
colour
is
probably
appreciated
differently
by
nearly
every
eye
how
the
eye
accepts
colours
and
conveys
them
to
the
mind
is
still
a
question
in
dispute
though
the
theories
of
tyndall
helmholz
hering
charpentier
and
others
aided
by
experiments
are
drawing
ascertained
facts
into
a
circle
which
will
ere
long
be
complete
and
the
mysteries
of
colour
may
be
ascertained
probably
the
effects
of
colour
on
educated
minds
are
as
various
as
the
tints
and
shades
of
tones
of
the
many
substances
which
receive
them
reflected
from
all
surrounding
objects
blazing
in
light
or
softened
by
shadow
fresh
and
glowing
or
permanently
faded
shining
with
modern
varnish
or
sobered
by
the
dust
of
ages
it
is
the
art
of
the
colourist
whether
he
paints
pictures
or
dyes
textiles
or
embroiders
them
to
reduce
the
tints
of
the
prism
to
an
endurable
and
delightful
lowness
of
tone
while
preserving
as
far
as
possible
all
their
light
and
purity
prismatic
colours
are
so
radiantly
glorious
that
when
we
see
the
rainbow
in
the
sky
it
is
each
time
a
joyful
surprise
the
most
stolid
natures
are
moved
by
it
we
have
even
seen
our
dog
staring
at
it
when
in
experiments
on
light
the
shafts
of
colour
are
thrown
on
the
wall
they
are
greeted
with
shouts
of
admiration
but
these
glories
are
veiled
to
us
by
the
fact
that
the
eye
can
not
dissect
the
prismatic
ray
without
the
assistance
of
the
instrument
that
has
revealed
it
this
is
a
merciful
arrangement
for
we
are
not
fitted
to
live
in
a
prismatic
display
any
more
than
in
a
continuity
of
lightning
flashes
we
should
go
mad
or
blind
if
exposed
to
either
science
has
shown
us
the
perfect
beauty
of
colour
without
form
the
soothing
pleasures
of
its
harmonies
and
the
delightful
surprises
of
its
contrasts
from
the
glimpses
we
have
of
its
nature
and
laws
we
may
hope
for
fresh
inspiration
for
the
art
of
the
colourist
though
it
is
true
that
each
eye
even
when
educated
retains
its
own
special
appreciation
of
the
colours
that
gratify
its
seeing
nerve
yet
there
are
certain
standards
which
give
almost
universal
pleasure
the
blind
and
the
must
remain
exceptions
for
all
time
and
there
are
many
gradations
in
till
we
come
to
the
normal
class
of
seeing
eyes
and
passing
them
by

to
those
few
men

colour
has
long
been
supposed
to
convey
certain
impressions
to
the
mind
the
absence
of
all
colour
which
we
call
black
symbolizes
in
dress
grief
pride
or
dignity
according
as
it
drapes
the
mourner
the
spanish
grandee
or
the
priest

the
colour
of
the
sun

light
red
stands
between
the
dark
and
the
lively
colours
and
represents
warmth
and
animation
dignity
splendour
life
love
and
joy
the
expression
of
blue
is
that
of
purity
it
recalls
the
distant
sky
the
calm
ocean
and
has
an
immortal
and
celestial
character
it
ascends
to
the
highest
and
descends
to
the
lowest
tones
of
nothing
so
nearly
approaches
pure
white
as
the
palest
blue
nothing
is
so
nearly
black
as
the
darkest
green
has
been
assigned
by
nature
the
place
of
the
universal
background
it
is
the
complementary
colour
of
red
softening
and
assimilating
it
by
reflected
shadows
and
setting
off
the
glory
of
every
flower
and
fruit
the
expression
of
green
is
gaiety
and
modesty
light
and
tenderness
shadow
and
repose
to
both
the
eye
and
the
mind
it
must
be
allowed
that
it
is
by
the
earliest
associations
of
the
individual
or
by
those
derived
from
the
family
the
tribe
or
the
nation
that
colours
are
connected
with
such
attributes
welded
by
art
and
time
into
traditional
meanings
which
they
absolutely
possess
and
from
which
fashion
can
not
disconnect
them
such
for
instance
is
the
royalty
of
purple
the
word
purple
is
so
indiscriminately
used
as
a
poetic
epithet
rather
than
as
a
distinctive
appellation
that
much
confusion
has
been
caused
by
it
historically
among
the
persians
greeks
and
romans
it
appears
to
have
been
simply
the
royal
colour
varying
from
the
purest
blue
through
every
shade
of
violet
down
to
the
deepest
crimson
sometimes
poetically
purple
seems
to
have
described
only
a
surface
the
breezy
or
stormy
sea
was
purple
the
sky
was
purple
the
hyacinthine
locks
of
narcissus
the
rosy
lips
of
venus
were
purple
as
a
textile
velvet
was
purple
even
when
it
was
white
the
epithets
purple
and
are
often
bestowed
on
the
mediterranean
sea
and
are
justified
by
its
occasional
hue
as
from
the
clouds
swell
with
showers
a
sudden
storm
the
purple
ocean
sweeps
drives
the
wild
waves
and
tosses

pope

iliad
xi
professor

that
the
soft
green
of
the
sea
shadowed
by
clouds
assumes
a
subjective
purple
hue
homer
must
have
observed
this
before
he
became
blind
pliny
gives
us
much
information
about
this
colour
he
enumerates
the
different
and
coasts
egyptian
asiatic
and
european
whence
came
the
the
murex
and
pelagia
that
produced
the
tyrian
purple
dyes
he
says
that
romulus
wore
the
purple
and
that
the
dyed
garments
all
purple
were
sacred
to
the
gods
in
those
days
after
saying
that
it
was
still
a
colour
of
distinction
he
continues
let
us
be
prepared
to
excuse
the
frantic
passion
for
purple
though
we
are
impelled
to
inquire
why
such
a
high
value
is
placed
on
the
produce
of
this
fish
seeing
that
in
the
dye
the
smell
of
it
is
offensive
and
the
colour
of
a
greenish
hue
resembles
the
sea
when
tempestuous
he
describes
purples
as
being
differently
coloured
according
as
to
whether
these
conchylia
inhabited
the
sea
mud
the
reefs
or
the
pebbly
shores
the
last
being
the
most
valuable
this
purple
said
to
have
been
imported
from
the
coasts
of
tyre
was
till
lately
sold
in
rome
for
its
weight
in
gold
it
gave
the
burning
rosy
red
dye
of
the
cardinal
robes
and
was
called
porpora
encarnadina
purple
incarnadine
it
is
full
of
light
and
freshness
and
never
fades
in
fact
it
has
all
the
qualities
ascribed
to
it
by
pliny
it
intensifies
in
the
light
after
purple
scarlet
was
the
colour
most
esteemed
by
the
ancients
the
israelites
must
have
carried
with
them
the
dyes
which
coloured
the
hangings
woven
or
embroidered
belonging
to
the
sanctuary
in
the
wilderness
of
which
the
outer
covering
of
rams
skins
was
dyed
scarlet
and
was
probably
of
the
nature
of
red
morocco
there
was
the
mineral
dye
cinnabar
or
red
sulphate
of
mercury
and
the
insect
dye
the
first
was
probably
used
in
mural
painting
it
is
translated
in
our
bible
as
vermilion
in
the
account
given
by
jeremiah
of
a
house
ceiled
with
cedar
and
painted
with
vermilion
also
ezekiel
gives
us
another
instance
of
in
vermilion
homer
who
as
a
rule
does
not
describe
colouring
says
the
greek
ships
were
painted
red
it
is
probable
that
cinnabar
was
tempered
by
admixture
of
white
or
other
colours
for
the
monochrome
painting
of
the
egyptians
and
greeks
it
was
called
by
the
greeks
miltos
by
the
romans
minium
the
dye
of
the
red
portions
of
the
funeral
tent
of
queen
shishak
is
found
by
analysis
to
be
composed
of
hematite
peroxyde
of
iron
tempered
with
lime
this
is
a
beautiful
pink
red
the
mineral
red
now
called
vermilion
must
have
borrowed
its
name
from
the
insect
dye
which
the
greeks
and
romans
called
kermes
in
the
middle
ages
the
dye
from
the
kermes
was
still
called
vermiculata
of
which
the
word
vermilion
is
a
literal
translation
we
should
be
fortunate
if
we
could
find
how
the
greeks
and
romans
prepared
the
cinnabar
for
mural
painting
of
which
we
find
remnants
in
ruins
and
tombs
a
lovely
and
pure
red
with
a
tender
bloom
on
it
like
a
fragment
of
the
rainbow
and
not
the
slightest
shade
of
yellow
one
of
the
most
beautiful
specimens
of
this
scarlet
that
i
am
acquainted
with
is
a
small
a
rhyton
at
the
british
museum
in
the
form
of
a
sphinx
with
a
white
face
gilded
hair
and
a
little
cap
of
pure
cinnabar
which
is
so
soft
in
tone
that
it
suggests
the
texture
of
scarlet
velvet
cochineal
which
was
first
brought
from
america
in
the
sixteenth
century
has
now
replaced
almost
every
other
scarlet
dye
for
textiles
crimson
is
once
mentioned
in
chronicles
as
karmel
which
may
mean
the
dye
of
the
kermes
insect
and
from
this
the
word
crimson
is
legitimately
derived
whether
the
scarlet
coupled
with
it
is
a
vegetable
mineral
or
insect
colour
we
have
no
means
of
ascertaining
though
your
sins
be
as
scarlet
they
shall
be
as
white
as
snow
though
they
be
red
as
crimson
they
shall
be
as
wool
from
what
pliny
says
it
appears
that
some
green
dyes
were
produced
from
a
green
clay
others
from
metals
copper
furnished
the
most
beautiful
shades
blue
has
always
been
extracted
from
indigo
pliny
tells
us
that
the
phœnicians
brought
it
from
barbarike
in
the
indies
to
egypt
and
he
quotes
the
periplus
on
this
subject
he
gives
an
amusing
report
that
indigo
is
a
froth
collected
round
the
stems
of
certain
reeds
but
he
was
aware
of
its
characteristic
property
that
of
emitting
a
beautiful
purple
vapour
when
submitted
to
great
heat
and
he
says
it
smells
like
the
sea
the
egyptians
likewise
extracted
blues
from
copper
yellow
was
anciently
in
egypt
sometimes
a
vegetable
and
sometimes
a
mineral
dye
browns
and
blacks
were
prepared
from
several
substances
especially
pine
wood
and
the
contents
of
tombs
burned
into
a
kind
of
charcoal
we
find
that
lime
chalk
white
lead
and
other
mineral
substances
were
employed
by
the
ancients
for
the
different
approaches
to
dazzling
whiteness
that
of
the
lily
the
emblem
of
purity
can
only
be
emulated
in
textile
or
pictorial
art
by
opaque
substances
reduced
as
much
as
possible
by
bleaching
to
the
last
expression
of
the
colour
of
the
raw
material
nothing
that
is
transparent
can
be
really
white
as
colours
are
seen
through
it
as
well
as
the
reflected
lights
on
the
two
surfaces
in
painting
we
can
produce
the
effect
of
whiteness
in
different
ways
leading
by
the
gradation
of
tender
colours
and
shadows
up
to
a
high
light
but
in
textile
art
which
is
essentially
flat
it
is
necessary
to
pursue
a
different
method
and
that
of
isolation
is
the
most
simple
and
effective
and
was
well
understood
in
egypt
greece
and
india
the
white
pattern
or
flower
is
surrounded
with
a
fine
dark
line
black
is
the
best
which
effectually
separates
it
from
all
the
surrounding
colours
and
gives
it
the
effect
of
light
even
when
the
whiteness
retains
enough
of
the
natural
colour
of
the
raw
material
to
tone
it
down
very
perceptibly
the
eye
accepts
it
as
white
and
ignores
the
tint
that
pervades
it
and
is
hardly
to
be
expelled
from
silk
or
wool
linen
and
cotton
are
the
whitest
of
materials
after
passing
through
the
hands
of
the
chemist
or
the
bleacher
it
is
amusing
to
observe
that
pliny
regarded
colours
whether
vegetable
or
mineral
rather
as
useful
for
the
pharmacopeia
of
his
day
than
as
dyes
or
artistic
pigments
he
speaks
contemptuously
of
the
art
of
his
time
and
yet
he
gives
some
curious
hints
that
are
well
worth
collecting
for
experiment
his
fragmentary
information
though
often
inaccurate
is
most
valuable
to
those
who
are
seeking
once
more
to
find
lasting
colours
and
despair
of
discovering
mordants
that
will
fix
the
aniline
tints
from
him
we
learn
more
of
the
egyptian
colouring
materials
than
of
any
others
as
he
named
their
sources
european
asiatic
or
african
and
there
is
no
doubt
of
the
perfection
of
their
mural
pigments
and
textile
dyes
which
have
remained
unimpaired
to
the
present
time
renouf
says
that
painting
as
it
is
now
understood
was
totally
unknown
to
the
egyptians
but
they
understood
harmony
of
colour
and
formulated
in
it
certain
principles
for
decorative
uses
they
made
the
primary
colours
predominate
over
the
secondary
by
quantity
and
position
they
introduced
fillets
of
white
or
yellow
in
their
embroideries
as
well
as
in
their
paintings
between
reds
and
greens
to
isolate
them
and
they
balanced
masses
of
yellow
with
a
due
proportion
of
black
they
never
blended
their
colours
and
had
no
sense
of
the
harmony
of
prismatic
gradations
or
the
melting
of
one
tint
into
another
each
was
worked
up
to
a
hard
and
fast
edge
line
if
in
one
part
of
a
building
one
set
of
colours
predominated
they
placed
a
greater
proportion
of
other
colours
elsewhere
within
the
range
of
sight
so
as
to
readjust
the
balance
those
they
employed
were
mostly
earthy
mineral
colours
used
alike
for
frescoes
and
for
painting
cotton
cloths
though
vegetable
dyes
were
needed
for
woollens
and
linens
these
were
for
pure
chalk
for
mixed
with
gum
for
yellow
ochre
for
a
mixture
of
yellow
ochre
and
powdered
blue
glass
for
this
same
blue
glass
mixed
with
white
chalk
for
an
earthy
pigment
containing
iron
and
aluminium
they
understood
the
chemistry
of
bleaching
and
the
use
of
mordants
in
dyeing
the
statistical
records
of
china
of
the
time
of
hias
according
to
semper
mention
colours
as
being
of
five
tints
and
all
the
produce
of
the
chinese
empire
in
the
unchanging
art
of
india
the
ancient
colours
are
used
now
therefore
when
we
give
the
following
list
we
must
suppose
that
it
embraces
all
that
have
been
known
from
the
beginning
indian
dyes
are
mostly
vegetable
for
akalbir
the
root

the
datiscus
canabinus

yellow
is

the

the
flower
of
nyclanthes

formerly
with

deepest
shade
of
indigo
speaking
of
indian
coloured
textiles
sir
birdwood
says
all
violent
contrasts
are
avoided
the
richest
colours
are
used
but
are
so
arranged
as
to
produce
the
effect
of
a
neutral
bloom
which
tones
down
every
detail
almost
to
the
softness
and
transparency
of
the
atmosphere
he
says
that
in
their
apparel
both
the
colouring
and
the
ornaments
are
adapted
to
the
effect
which
the
fabrics
will
produce
when
worn
and
in
motion
it
is
only
through
generations
of
patient
practice
that
men
attain
to
the
mystery
of
such
subtleties
an
outline
in
black
or
some
dark
colour
that
harmonizes
with
the
ground
or
else
worked
in
gold
is
common
in
indian
work
not
only
for
the
purpose
of
isolating
the
colours
of
the
design
but
also
to
give
a
uniform
tone
to
the
whole
surface
of
the
texture
their
traditional
arrangements
of
tints
were
thoroughly
satisfying
to
the
eye
but
degenerated
by
european
commerce
the
artistic
sense
of
beauty
itself
is
disappearing
throughout
our
indian
empire
persian
carpets
the
fine
old
ones
of
the
fourteenth
to
the
seventeenth
centuries
give
us
lessons
in
the
art
of
isolating
colours
in
these
a
flower
will
lie
upon
a
surface
which
contains
two
or
more
other
tints
and
as
the
design
passes
over
them
the
outline
colour
is
changed
so
as
to
isolate
the
flower
equally
on
the
different
grounds
this
is
done
with
such
art
that
the
eye
ignores
the
transition
till
it
is
called
to
remark
it
for
instance
as
a
white
or
pattern
wanders
over
a
green
and
red
ground
the
outline
changes
suddenly
from
green
to
red
and
again
to
green
as
it
leaves
the
opposite
colour
on
the
ground
pattern
floyer
speaks
of
the
brilliancy
and
lasting
qualities
of
the
dyes
which
the
persians
by
slow
and
tedious
processes
extract
from
plants
from
the
runaschk
madder
a
fine
red
from
the
zarili
the
golden
which
is
a
yellow
flower
from
khorasan
and
also
from
the
leaves
of
the
vine
a
bright
yellow
they
import
indigo
from
shastra
or
from
india
by
the
khurum
river
he
says
these
dyes
are
perfectly
fast
leaving
no
trace
on
a
wetted
rubber
whereas
the
european
dyes
they
sometimes
use
come
off
freely
pliny
says
the
gauls
had
invented
dyes
counterfeiting
the
purple
of
tyre
also
scarlet
violet
and
green
all
of
these
were
dipped
in
the
juices
of
herbs
vitruvius
says
the
romans
extracted
dyes
from
flowers
and
fruits
but
he
neither
specifies
nor
describes
them
the
ancient
highland
tartans
were
dyed
with
bark
of
alder
for
black
bark
of
willow
for
flesh
colour
a
lichen
growing
on
stones
supplied
their
violets
and
crimson
the
lichen
on
the
gives
a
good
brown
heather
gives
red
purple
and
green
thus
we
see
that
pure
colours
for
dyeing
textiles
have
been
extracted
from
vegetable
substances
herbs
wood
seeds
flowers
and
fruits
mosses
and
mineral
substances
earths
sands
ores
metals
rusts
and
stones
animal
substances
both
of
land
water
and
air
beasts
fishes
shells
birds
and
insects
it
is
evident
from
the
derivation
of
the
word
that
there
were
chromatic
scales
in
colour
before
the
phrase
was
ever
applied
to
music
the
greeks
and
romans
are
supposed
to
have
understood
chromatic
scales
of
tints
animal
vegetable
and
mineral
and
except
with
the
intention
of
producing
startling
effects
they
did
not
mix
them
they
felt
that
each
was
harmonious
as
a
whole
and
unlike
the
egyptians
they
studied
harmony
they
arranged
their
scales
according
to
the
materials
from
which
they
were
extracted
and
kept
those
from
different
chemical
sources
apart
as
being
discordant
one

these

they
were
called

the
chemistry
of
the
arts
of

was
not
unknown
to
the
ancients
but
they
reserved
and
regulated
it
for
certain
purposes
preferring
to
retain
at
least
a
part
of
the
original

shades

edouard
charton
ascribes
the
great
change
in
the
modern
scales
of
colours
to
the
discovery
by
the
french
in
the
gobelins
of
a
pure
scarlet
dye
the
use
of
which
made
it
necessary
to
raise
the
tone
of
all
other
colours
he
says
that
scarlet
was
formerly
represented
by
the
dye
called
kermes
which
indeed
was
not
scarlet
but
altered
from
crimson
to
something
approaching
it
by
the
addition
of
narsingar
of
which
the
bright
yellow
gave
the
scarlet
effect
chevreul
director
of
the
dyeing
department
of
the
gobelins
has
succeeded
in
composing
the
chromatic
prism
to
which
i
have
already
alluded
containing
different
tones
we
may
take
it
for
granted
that
from
these
may
be
selected
any
possible
scale
of
tints
required
for
decorative
work
this
vast
area
for
choice
of
our
material
will
impose
on
the
artist
of
the
future
fresh
responsibilities
in
the
typical
oriental
colouring
the
whole
arrangement
was
traditional
and
it
was
irreligious
to
depart
from
what
had
been
fixed
by
statute
many
centuries
before
and
only
perfected
by
the
experience
of
many
generations
of
men
and
this
veneration
for
traditional
custom
has
hitherto
been
prevalent
in
european
art
to
a
certain
point
but
the
old
conservative
perfection
of
unadulterated
colour
has
already
been
done
away
with
the
freedom
of
experimental
art
is
chartered
and
mercantile
interests
now
as
ever
govern
the
supply
of
materials
our
normal
bad
taste
and
carelessness
has
been
cast
back
on
the
lands
which
were
the
cradle
of
art
and
we
receive
to
our
surprise
gaudy
vulgar
and
discordant
combinations
from
the
east
whence
we
drew
our
first
inspirations
for
the
future
we
shall
have
to
study
ancient
specimens
and
correct
our
errors
by
the
help
of
their
teaching
to
the
eye
and
mind
gas
colours
are
at
present
our
worst
snares
they
are
in
general
very
beautiful
but
they
are
so
evanescent
and
fade
into
such
unexpected
and
contradictory
tones
that
we
can
not
reckon
upon
them
when
embroidering
with
the
coloured
materials
of
the
day
we
are
in
constant
dread
of
what
disastrous
effect
may
be
produced
by
the
first
shaft
of
sunshine
that
may
fall
from
our
moderately
illuminated
sky
through
the
uncurtained
window
the
trade
in
colours
can
hardly
be
an
honest
one
till
the
means
of
fixing
each
tint
permanently
is
ascertained
at
any
rate
something
should
be
done
towards
grouping
them
with
respect
to
their
enduring
qualities
so
that
when
they
fade
if
fade
they
must
they
may
do
so
harmoniously
and
in
sympathy
with
each
other
and
while
they
are
in
their
first
glow
they
should
be
selected
as
much
as
possible
from
what
pliny
calls
natural
colours
which
recall
the
exquisite

out

displayed

the
reason
i
have
entered
in
even
so
cursory
a
manner
into
the

of

is
my
desire
to
point
out
the
great
value
placed
long
ago
on
the
careful
preparation
of
those
used
in
ancient
textile
art
and
to
show
how
our
forefathers
sought
them
out
in
many
lands
and
waters
how
they
noted
their
varieties
how
they
classed
and
prized
them
for
their
endurance
as
well
as
for
their
pristine
beauty
how
they
paid
their
weight
in
gold
or
silver
for
certain
culminating
tints
and
how
they
therefore
produced
works
which
became
matters
of
history

of

a
design
which
includes
the
pattern
and
the
handicraft

stitches
the
motive
and
the
needlework
in
painting
as
in
sculpture
the
first
idea
as
well
as
the
last
touch
must
come
from
the
same
head
and
hand
but
in
needlework
it
is
not
so
the
pattern
is
the
result
of
tradition
it
is
almost
always
simply
a
variation
of
old
forms
altered
and
renewed
by
surrounding
circumstances
and
sudden
or
gradual
periods
of
change
however
much
the
design
may
alter
rising
often
to
the
highest
point
of

art

as
often
falling

are

that
the

sewed
in

to
sew
in
contradistinction
to
the
word
to
embroider
is
derived
from
the
sanskrit
and
thence
imported
into
latin
to
prove
how
highly
esteemed
needlework
was
among
the
romans
i
may
mention
that
the
equivalent
of
the
phrase
to
hit
the
right
nail
on
the
head
was
acu
to
touch
the
question
with
the
point
of
the
needle
plain
work
is
that
which
is
necessary
as
soon
as
textiles
are
needed
for
covering
and
clothing
the
means
are
invented
for
drawing
the
cut
edges
together
and
for
preventing
the
fraying
where
the
material
is
lacerated
by
the
shaping
process
hence
the
seam
the
hem
and
all
the
forms
of
stitches
that
bind
and
plait
these
necessary
stitches
constitute
plain
needlework
and
are
closely
followed
by
decorative
stitches
which
in
gradation
cover
the
space
between
plain
needlework
and
embroidery
semper

given
us
his
archæological
theories
for
the
origin
of
needlework
and
its
stitches
these
are
his
arguments
if
not
always
his
words
he
says
the
seam
is
one
of
the
first
human
successful
efforts
to
conquer
difficulties
a
string
a
ribbon
a
band
may
serve
to
keep
together
several
loose
things
but
by
means
of
the
seam
small
things
actually
become
large
ones
for
example
a
man
can
by
its
help
cover
himself
with
a
garment
made
of
the
skins
of
many
small
animals
when
eve
sewed
together
she
made
of
these
small
pieces
a
garment
of
patchwork
acting
on
the
principle
of
making
a
virtue
of
necessity
accepting
and
adorning
the
severe
facts
of
life
seams
came
to
be
an
important
vehicle
of
ornament
the
gauls

britons
embroidered
the
seams
of
their
fur
garments
we
may
judge
of
the
antiquity
of
the
seam
by
its
universal
and
mythological
meaning
the
seam
the
tie
the
knot
the
plait
and
the
mesh
are
the
earliest
symbols
of
fate
uniting
events
we
find
but
little
mention
of
plain
work
in
mediæval
writings
when
linen
was
worked
for
some
honourable
purpose
such
as
a
gift
to
a
friend
or
a
royal
personage
it
was
generally
embroidered
or
stitched
in

fancy
fashion

much

i
feel

my

laid

its

dullest
understanding

us
how
to
teach

young

shows
us
the
quickest
and
most
perfect
way
of
working
different
materials
for
different
purposes
and
tells
us
how
to
select
them
i
will
therefore
refer
my
readers
to
her
most
useful
and
instructive
books
and
pass
on
at
once
from
the
craft
of
plain
needlework
to
stitches
as
the
art
of

the
link
between
plain
and
decorative
work
deserves
attention
this
link
is
white
embroidery
i
imagine
it
was
not
a
very
ancient
form
of
the
art
and
was
practised
first
in
mediæval
days
when
we
begin
to
have
constant
notices
of
it
the
first
white
laces
appear
to
have
followed
close
upon
the
first
white
embroideries

is

of

where
the
effigy
of
a
knight
lies
on
his

draped
with
a

and

both
embroidered
these
are
evidently

them

the

do

we
must
suppose
it

indeed
the
love
of

is
by
no
means
an
english
national
tendency
in
the
lower
classes
nothing
but
the
plainest
work
is
taught
in

anything
approaching
to
decorative
art
with
us
has
been
the
accomplishment
of
educated

not
the

gives
rules
for

the
reasons
from
which

are
good
he
says
that
allowing
it
as
a
maxim
that
each
textile
has
its
own
uses
and
its
own
beauties
we
should
place
nothing
on
linen
which
would
militate
against
its
inherent
qualities
and
merits
and
that
as
the
great
beauty
of
flax
is
its
smoothness
and
purity
all
projections
and
roughnesses
should
be
avoided
which
would
catch
dust
or
throw
a
shadow
carrying
out
this
idea
it
would
appear
that
satin
and
not
lace
stitches
are
therefore
the
most
suitable
for
this
kind
of
decoration
the
accepted
rule
for
selecting
the
stitch
for
each
piece
of
work
is
this
on
stout
grounds
the
thread
should
be
round
and
rich
whereas
delicate
materials
carry
best
the
most
refined
and
shining
thread
work
and
in
embroidering
the
smooth
surface
of
linen
fabrics
the
flattest
stitches
are
the
most
appropriate

gold
embroideries
were
by
the
romans
attributed
to
the
phrygians
all
gold
work
was
vaguely
supposed
to
be
theirs
as
all
other
embroidery
was
included
in
the
craft
of
the
plumarii
in
rome
it
has
been
disputed
whether
needlework
in
gold
preceded
the
weaving
of
flat
gold
or
thread
into
stuffs
or
whether
it
was
an
and
an
enrichment
of
such
textiles
i
imagine
that
the
embroidery
was
the
first
and
that
the
was
the
art
of
weaving
gold
babylonian
embroideries
appear
to
be
of
gold
wire
as
we
see
them
in
the
ninevite
marbles
an
instance
of
the
way
golden
embroideries
were
displayed
among
the
greeks
is
that
of
the
athenian
peplos
which
as
i
have
already
said
was
worked
by
embroideresses
under
the
superintendence
of
two
arrhephoræ
of
noble
birth
it
was
either
scarlet
or
saffron
colour
and
blazed
with
golden
representations
of
the
battles
of
the
giants
or
local
myths
and
events
in
the
history
of
athens
the
art
of
the
phrygians
who
gave
their
name
in
rome
to
all
golden
has
come
down
to
us
through
the
classic
auriphrygium
and
the
orphreys
of
the
middle
ages
semper
thinks
that
the
flat
gold
embroidery
was
the
first
invented
the
phrygians
had
attained
to
the
utmost
perfection
in
tissue
ornament
when
the
romans
conquered
them
and
finding
their
art
congenial
to
the
growing
luxury
of
rome
they
imported
and
domesticated
it
both
the
people
and
their
work
retaining
their
national
designation
pliny
ignorant
of
the
claims
of
the
chinese
gave
to
the
phrygians
the
credit
of
being
the
inventors
of
all
embroidery
the
garments
they
thus
decorated
were
called
phrygionæ
and
the
work
itself
opus
phrygium
the
term
auriphrygium
at
first
given
to
work
in
gold
only
was
in
time
applied
to
all
embroidery
that
admitted
gold
into
its
composition
and
hence
the
english
mediæval
term
orphreys

the
gold

now
called

came
from
phrygia

all
the

phrygians
calling

are
splendidly
exemplified
in
the
embroidered
mantle
of
stephen
of
the
ninth
century
the
only
somewhat
earlier
piece
of
mediæval
gold
embroidery
with
which
i
am
acquainted
is
the

of
charlemagne
in
the
vatican
richly
embroidered
in

and
the
mantle
of
the
emperor
henry
ii
in
the
museum
at
munich
worked
by
his
empress
kunigunda
who
appears
to
have
been
somewhat
parsimonious
in
her
use
of
the
precious
material
almost
all
ecclesiastical
and
royal
ancient
embroideries
were
illuminated
with
golden
grounds
golden
outlines
or
golden

later
still
raised
gold
thread
work
has
imitated
gilt
carvings
or
goldsmiths
jewellery
and
we
feel
that
it
was
at
once
removed
from
its
place
as
embroidery
and
became
an
elaborate
imitation
of
what
should
belong
to
another
craft
such
deviations
from
the
proper
office
and
motive
of
needlework
are
so
dangerously
near
to
bad
style
and
bad
taste
that
they
always
and
inevitably
have
fallen
into

this
opus
pulvinarium
is
not
only
to
be
found
in
oriental
work
but
it
has
also
survived
in
a
very
few
fragments
from
egypt
one
of

in

another
in

they
are
regular
canvas

cross

and
therefore
under
mediæval
nomenclature
would
be
classed
as

this
name
must
include
all

in

term

stitches
is
a

one
as

that
are
relegated
into
patterns
in
small
square
spaces
counted
by
the
threads
of
the
textile
on
which
they
are
laid
he
believes
that
the
mosaic
patterns
and
cross
stitches
in
needlework
preceded
the
tesselated
pavements
and
formed
their
first
motive
though
the
stitch
now
refers
itself
back
to
the
mosaic
at
least
in
name
it
is
remarkable
that
in
chaldea
and
assyria
there
still
exist
some
ruined
walls
which
are
adorned
with
pilasters
panels
and
other
architectural
forms
covered
with
some
sort
of
encaustic
imitating
textile
patterns
the
effect
is
produced
by
means
of
a
kind
of
mosaic
work
of
small
nails
or
wedges
of
baked
clay
with
china
or
glazed
coloured
heads
these
are
inlaid
into
the
unbaked
clay
or
earth
of
which
the
walls
are
constructed
and
while
binding
it
together
give
the
effect
of
the
surface
being
hung
with
a
material
which
has
a
pattern
worked
all
over
in
cross
stitch
the
chinese
the
chaldeans
and
the
assyrians
long
continued
to
show
in
their
buildings
the
tradition
of
this
style
of
decoration
in
egypt
there
has
been
found
some
unfinished
mural
painting
where
the
plaster
has
been
previously
prepared
by
dividing
it
into
small
rectangular
spaces
apparently
on
the
principle
of
the
canvas
ground
for
cross
stitches
the
name
mosaic
stitch
does
not
interfere
with
or
militate
against
the
classical
appellation
of
which
means
shrine
work
or
cushion
stitches
these
appear
to
have
been
from
the
first
considered
as
the
best
suited
for
adorning
cushions
chairs
footstools
and
the
beds
on
which
men
reclined
at
their
feasts
as
they
are
stitches
which
will
stand
friction
most
of
the
work
now
done
in
syria
turkey
greece
and
the
principalities
shows
different
forms
of
the
mosaic
stitches
so
also
does
the
national
russian
work
which
is
byzantine
all
these
designs
are
conventional
and
mostly
geometrical
this
work
in
the
east
is
generally
the
same
on
both
sides
we
may
infer
that
the
spoil
anticipated
by
sisera
mother
the
garments
embroidered
on
both
sides
fit
for
the
necks
of
those
who
divide
the
spoil
was
of
this
kind
thus
we
see
that
the
opus
pulvinarium
has
a
very
respectable
ancestry
and
though
it
had
somewhat
degenerated
in
the
early
part
of
our
century
and
had
languished
and
almost
died
out
under
the

yet
it
has
done
good
service
through
the
days
of
mediæval

down
to
the
present
time
both
in
england
and
throughout
europe
pl
and
it
will
probably
revive
and
continue
to
be
generally
used
though
the
least
available
for
historical
or
pictorial
work
and
not
by
any
means
the
best
for
as
the
squareness
of
the
stitches
refuses
to
lend
itself
to
flowing
lines
or
gradations
of
colour
unless
the
stitches
are
extremely
fine
and
the
work
in
consequence
very
laborious
yet
it
finds
its
especial
fitness
in
all
geometrical
designs
it
is
also
particularly
well
suited
to
heraldic
subjects
a
remarkable
example
of
the
use
of
cross
stitches
exists
in
the
borders
of
the
syon
cope
in
which
the
are
so
executed
this
is
of
the

the
origin
of
the

is
much
disputed
but
it
is
supposed
to
have
pointed
to
a
decoration
of
plumage
work
and
we
find
that
feathers
have
been
an
element
in
artistic
design

the
earliest
times

were

in

painting

certainly
had
feathers
for
their

that
they
were

this
is
possible
for
we
still
obtain
from
thence
specimens
of
work
in
different
materials
partly
onlaid
in

sometimes
the

by

for

though
now
looked
down
upon
as

a
style

because
it
exists
no
longer
except
in

we
must
consider
feather
work
as
a
relic
of
a
past
higher
civilization

has
died
out

than
simply
as
the

himself

lost

the
name
of

plumarium
remains
and
proves
that
it
was
still
recognized
as
such
in
the
days
of
roman
luxury
the
name
survived
when
the
practice
was
all
but
forgotten
in

and
the

itself
disused

because
the

of

rarely
have
any

of

the

of

also
cultivated

is
so
mysterious
that
we
have
as

no

of
judging
whence

fergusson
suggests
the
similarity
between
central
asian
and
central
american
art
both
in
architectural
forms
and
plastic
and
sculptured
remains
he
thinks
that
its
tradition
was
transmitted
from
asia
to
america
in
the
third
and
fourth
centuries
of
our
era
if
so
it
was
an
unlucky
moment
for
the
recipients
as
the
art
of
asia
as
well
as
that
of
europe
was
then
at
its
lowest
and
most
debased
phase
perhaps
however
the
more
fit
for
the
fertilization
of
that
of
a
perfectly
barbarous
people
there
is
something
fascinating
in
the
suggestions
on
this
subject
in
donelly
atlantis
but
when
conjecture
is
only
founded
on
tradition
and
without
proof
we
must
not
take
it
into
serious
consideration
having
proved
the
universal
use
of
feathers
it
is
not
difficult
to
appreciate
the
causes
which
suggested
everywhere
the
transfer
of
this
decorative
art
to
another
craft
employing
less
perishable
materials
embroidery
probably
followed
it
closely
and
absorbed
it
throughout
asia
and
in
egypt
and
the
survivals
now
are
only
an
accidental
specimen
a
tradition
and
a
name
the
name
plumarii
for
the
embroideries
is
thus
fully
accounted
for
and
we
need
seek
no
further
elucidation
it
was
commonly
used
in
classical
roman
times
opus
plumarium
seems
to
have
become
the
legitimate
term
for
all
needlework
the
plumarii
were
the
embroiderers
whether
their
work
was
in
wool
or
thread
or
in
silk
at
a
later
period
with
or
without
admixture
of
gold
or
silver
as
the
argentarii
were
the
jewellers
the
article
on
the
word
plumarius
in
hoffman
lexicon
after
describing
two
kinds
of
plumarii
phrygians
and
babylonians
proceeds
to
say
these
latter
who
wove
garments
and
hangings
of
various
colours
were
called
but
though
this
name
was
at
first
confined
to
craftsmen
who
wove
patterns
in
the
shape
of
feathers
in
course
of
time
the
name
was
extended
to
those
artists
who
with
the
needle
or
by
painting
embellished
robes
the
opus
plumarium
included
as
i
before
said
all
flat
stitches
and
i
repeat
that
feather
application
was
certainly
its
first
motive
and
next
came
the
stitches
that
conveyed
the
same
desired
effect
though
a
new
material
was
employed
fitted
for
the
needle
which
having
served
its
apprenticeship
in
plain
work
now
came
to
the
front
as
a
decorative
agent
painting
with
the
needle
began
with
an
attempt
to
model
with
it
the
lay
of
stitches
being
so
arranged
as
to
give
the
whole
effect
of
light
and
shadow
so
as
to
delineate
the
forms
without
changing
the
shades
of
the
material
used
i
give
on
the
opposite
page
some
japanese
birds
which
will
explain
what
i
mean
the
stitches
are
so
intelligently
placed
as
absolutely
to
give
the
forms
of
the
birds
imitated
they
represent
plumage
and
a
more
artistic
representation
can
not
be
imagined
pl
the
same
stitch
which
we
find
prevailing
in
china
and
japan
as
plumage
work
is
employed
in
embroidering
flowers
here
satin
stem
and
plumage
stitches
are
blended
together
and
excellent
decorative
effects
are
produced
but
the
texture
of
flowers
is
not
to
be
imitated
as
is
that
of
the
plumage
of
birds
satin
stitch
is
a
more
restricted
form
of
plumage
stitch
and
stem
is
another
variety
of
these
flat
stitches
very
useful
in
its
place
i
therefore
have
assigned
the
name
of
plumage
stitch
to
that
hitherto
called
embroidery
or
long
and
short
stitches
and
i
give
the
term
plumage
work
to
include
all
the
flat
stitches
practically
it
is
allowed
that
these
flat
stitches
especially
the
plumage
stitch
give
most
scope
for
freedom
in
needlework
as
they
are
laid
on
at
once
and
according
to
the
inspiration
of
the
worker
and
may
cover
the
outline
and
efface
it
the
stitches
are
not
counted
and
have
more
of
the
nature
of
touch
than
any
others
as
their
length
thickness
and
closeness
may
be
varied
at
will
the
artist
design
thus
admits
of
interpretation
according
to
the
taste
and
feeling
of
the
needlewoman

perhaps
their

that

this
art
of
application
is

part
of

it
is
the
best

most
economical
method
for
restoration

the

material
is
generally
worn
out
long
before
the
stitches
laid
upon
it
much
beautiful
work
has
thus
been
rescued
from
annihilation
and
restored
to
use
from
its
long
imprisonment
in
the
boxes
and
drawers
of
the
garret
and
but
it
is
cruel
to
transfer
historical
or
typical
works
and
so
puzzle
the
artist
and
the
historian
it
is
so
troublesome
to
embroider
on
velvet
or
plush
or
gold
tissues
that
application
is
the
easiest
and
most
effective
mode
of
dealing
with
these
fabrics
the
outlines
laid
down
in
cord
have
the
best
effect
while
binding
the
edges
and
securing
them
from
fraying
and
it
is
almost
certain
that
the
eye
receives
most
pleasure
in
flat
art
from
a
defined
outline
which
satisfies
it
where
there
are
no
cast
shadows
it
lifts
the
work
from
the
background
and
separating
the
colours
it
enhances
their
beauty
it
would
appear
however
as
a
rule
that
either
black
or
gold
metal
should
invariably
be
employed
because
they
do
not
interfere
with
any
colour
they
approach

colour
instead
of

as
we
see
in

in

opus
filatorium
or
araneum
palliser
says
that
from
the
earliest
times
the
art
of
has
been
so
mixed
up
with
that
of
needlework
that
it
is
impossible
to
enter
upon
the
one
without
naming
the
other
this
is
in
fact
what
she
has
done
showing
the
intimate
connection
between
the
two
in
her
charming
work
on
lace
where
much
information
about
embroideries
in
general
may
be
found
in
the
introduction
blanc
also
considers
that
there
is
but
a
slight
transition
between
embroidery
and
guipure
which
he
says
was
the
first
lace
as
all
the
earliest
specimens
and
designs
for
guipure
were
venetian
the
art
was
therefore
probably
an
italian
invention
though
an
oriental
origin
has
sometimes
been
attributed
to
it
the
objection
to
this
last
theory
is
that
we
find
no
ancient
specimens
and
no
modern
continuation
of
such
work
in
the
east
the
word
guipure
is
a
it
has
been
applied
to
many
forms
in
the
varying
art
of
which
same
variableness
has
caused
its
nomenclature
to
assume
the
terms
belonging
to
other
textile
arts
where
they
approach
or
touch
each
other
as
in
netting
fringes
or
embroideries
the
nearest
approach
to
laces
before
the
thirteenth
century
was
more
in
the
nature
of
what
we
now
call
guimp
embroidery
differs
from
lace
in
that
it
is
worked
on
already
woven
tissues
whereas
lace
is
manufactured
at
once
both
ground
and
design
but
the
link
between
the
two
is
not
missing
in
the
twelfth
century
they
worked
opus
filatorium
which
consisted
of
embroidery
with
the
needle
on
linen
of
which
half
the
threads
had
been
drawn
out
and
the
remainder
were
worked
into
a
net
by
knotting
them
into
groups
then
dividing
and
knotting
them
again
there
is
a
piece
of
work
described
in
an
old
catalogue
quoted
by
rock
paul
london
had
a
cushion
covered
with
knotted
thread
pulvinar

nodato
here
lace
and
embroidery
touch
each
other
sir
gardiner
wilkinson
notices
some
early
egyptian
work
in
the
louvre
as
a
piece
of
white
network
pattern
each
mesh
containing
an
irregular
cubic
figure
this
sounds
much
like
it
may
be
fairly
asserted
that
the
term
embroidery
embraces
the
craft
of
as
almost
all
ancient
and
much
modern
lace
is
simple
embroidery
and
formed
entirely
by
the
needle
some
kinds
of
lace
however
are
made
by
plaiting
and
twisting
the
threads
attached
to
bobbins
round
pins
which
are
previously
arranged
in
the
holes
of
a
pattern
pricked
on
parchment
or
glazed
paper
the
original
motive
and
idea
of
lace
is
a
net
the
patterns
called
by
the
ancients
de
fundata
are
netted
designs
meshed
you
will
see
them
constantly
in
egyptian

in

in

in
the
last
century

law
was
passed
in

forbidding

laces
embroidered
in

to
be
wider
than
due
dita
about
two
inches
this
paternal
interference
in
the
details
of
life
is
truly
venetian
it
was
intended
to
protect
the
nobles
and
citizens
from
injuring
themselves
and
setting
a
bad
example
perhaps
this
strict
rule
was
relaxed
in
favour
of
crowned
heads
and
royal
personages
for
there
is

gold
and
silver
lace
embroidered
in
coloured
silk
specimens
of
these
laces
are
rare
owing
to
the
intrinsic
value
of
the
metal
we
must
suppose
the
origin
of
these
golden
trimmings
to
belong
to
a
very
early
period
a
piece
of
gold
wire
lace
guimp
was
lately
found
in
a
tomb
near
wareham
and
is
supposed
with
reason
to
be
scandinavian
blanc
describes
lace
as
a
treillage
or
network
and
says
it
is
made
in
three
ways
you
may
complete
the
ground
first
and
then
work
the
pattern
with
the
needle
this
he
calls
lace
pure
et
simple
and
he
considers
that
it
differs
from
guipure
in
that
the
latter
consists
of
flowers
and
arabesques
worked
separately
and
then
connected
with
bars
lines
or
meshes
this
guipure
is
the
second
mode
of
the
third
is
by
machinery
but
this
has
the
inherent
defect
of
all
fabrics
to
a
practised
eye
a
certain
rigidity
and
coldness
in
the
exactly
repeated
forms
in
which
the
human
touch
is
wanting
it
is
curious
how
in
art
even
a
pentimento
is
valuable
recalling
the
hand
that
erred
as
well
as
created
the
attention
that
strayed
or
reconsidered
the
design
blanc
speaking
of
the
beauty
of
point
praises
it
especially
as
being
entirely
needlework
he
names
the
different
modes
of
and
judges
their
merits
of
lace
he
says
and
the
value
of
this
lace
not
only
arises
from
its
representing
a
considerable
amount
of
labour
but
also
because
nothing
can
replace
in
human
estimation
the
fabrics
produced
by
a
man
and
still
less
by
a
woman
handicraft
however
the
hand
may
have
been
restrained
by
the
necessity
of
faithfully
following
on
green
parchment
the
designs
imagined
and
traced
by
another
person
there
is
always
even
in
copying
an
outline
an
individuality
an
imperceptible
deviation
to
the
right
or
to
the
left
above
or
below
the
tracing
which
impresses
on
the
design
the
accent
of
strength
or
weakness
of
indecision
or
determination
i
would
add
of
intelligence
or
stupidity
of
knowledge
or
ignorance
this
is
not
the
first
time
and
will
certainly
not
be
the
last
that
i
shall
have
sought
to
impress
on
the
needlewoman
the
fact
that
her
individuality
can
not
fail
to
be
strongly
marked
in
her
work
and
i
would
urge
her
to
carry
out
the
suggestions
that
her
experience
and
her
taste
afford
her
while
seeking
to
render
faithfully

technical
history
of
venetian
laces
translated
into
english
by
lady
layard
is
a
beautiful
little
book
and
a
worthy
imitation
of
the
ancient
of
the
sixteenth
and
seventeenth
centuries
the
subject
has
been
so
thoroughly
discussed
by
adepts
in
connection
with
its
revival
as
a
local
industry
in
its
original
cradle
that
i
will
confine
myself
to
a
few
observations
on
its
history
and
its
place
in
decorative
art
fringes
knotting
netting
knitting
crochet
tatting
and
are
all
parts
of
the
same
branch
of
ornamental
needlework
they
are
all
trimmings
in
the
sense
of
being
decorative
edges
to
more
solid
materials
they
are
not
available
as
coverings
for
warmth
or
decency
but
they
serve
to
give
the
grace
of
mystery
to
the
object
they
drape
or
veil
they
soften
the
outlines
and
the
colours
beneath
them
while
they
permit
them
to
peep
through
their
meshes
they
are
hardly
to
be
included
in
what
is
called
high
art
having
more
affinity
with
grace
refinement
and
coquetry
than
with
æsthetic
culture
or
noble
thought
this
tendency
in
lace
work
may
be
the
reason
that
the
masculine
mind
does
not
in
general
appreciate
these
lovely
textures
but
rather
despises
them
even
when
the
designs
are
beautiful
and
ingenious
as
being
flimsy
and
deficient
in
honest
intention
whereas
women
have
always
greatly
prized
them
for
their
delicacy
and
refinement
and
their
great
value
on
account
of
the
time
trouble
and
eyesight
expended
upon
them
their
knowledge
of
stitches
also
enables
them
to
appreciate
their
variety
and
the
taste
shown
in
their
selection
and
arrangement
for
carrying
out
each
design
lace
stitches
are
almost
innumerable
upwards
of
a
hundred
are
named
and
their
variations
are
endless
but
a
volume
would
not
suffice
us
for
entering
into
the
details
of
the
craft
many
of
its
stitches
have
been
imported
into
embroideries
in
gold
silk
and
crewels
and
such
adaptations
are
always
allowable
provided
the
effect
is
good
we
have
every
reason
to
believe
that
the
claims
of
venice
as
the
first
and
original
school
of
have
been
satisfactorily
proved

germany

started
their

but
lady
layard
believes
that
spain
received
all
her
inspiration
and
the
greater
part
of
her
laces
from
venice
which
likewise
sent
teachers
to
france
and
to
brussels
or
rather
we
may
say
had
many
workwomen
decoyed
from
her
manufactories
to
assist
in
starting
rival
industries

other
countries

printed
in

in
the
sixteenth
century

these

they
are

entitled

imitated
in
france

venice
was
proud
of
her
industry
and
of
the
noble
ladies
who
fostered
it
it
is
recorded
in
the

of

that
giovanna

of

the

she

fostered
the
art
of
printing
in

and
is
spoken
of
as
a
principessa

and
her
memory
is
cherished
in
connection
with
these
proofs
of
her
patriotism

hear
also
that

the

but
not
beyond
their
value
when
we
consider
the
vast
amount
of
skilled
labour
bestowed
on
them
we
are
often
told
that
old
lace
is
cheaper
than
new
as
an
absurd
fact
because
the
antiquity
of
lace
is
supposed
to
add
to
its
value
yes
but
principally
as
an
object
of
archæological
interest
whereas
that
which
is
being
made
now
is
supporting
by
its
daily

the
needlewoman
and
her
family
and
perhaps
providing
for
her
old

and
as
the

is
very
heavy
many

in

lose
their

for

we
can
not

that

unreasonable
zanon

gives
us
an
idea
of
how
costly
they

he
says
that
giuseppe
berardi
a
lace
merchant
in
venice
made
a
profit
of
francs
on
a
commission
for
a
set
of
lace
for
the
wedding
of
joseph
emperor
of
germany
which
proves
the
high
prices
paid
for
the
new
laces
of
their
day
blond
laces
which
take
their
turn
occasionally
as
fashionable
trimmings
veils
and
spanish
mantillas
are
so
called
from
their
original
venetian
name
merletti
biondi
pale
laces
de
gheltof
derives
this
appellation
from
the
celebrated
collar
of
louis
quatorze
and
fancies
it
was
made
of
the
fair
hair
of
the
workers
but
this
is
only
vague
conjecture
the
term
was
applied
in
the
seventeenth
century
to
laces
in
silk
gold
and
silver
never
to
thread
laces
i
confess
i
do
not
find
the
reason
for
the
name
but
accept
de
information
that
it
was
given
by
the
authority
of
the
magistrates
of
mercanzia
in
this
is
but
a
very
slight
sketch
of
the
history
of
lace
venice
being
its
birthplace
and
likewise
the
busy
scene
of
its
rehabilitation
i
have
lingered
over
its
school
and
left
but
little
space
for
the
discussion
of
those
of
spain
flanders
belgium
and
france
but
these
have
been
thoroughly
investigated
and
their
individual
merits
are
well
appreciated
both
as
antique
and
modern
dress
decoration
i
have
already
said
that
the
lace
schools
in
france
were
instituted
by
colbert
who
placed
one
at
auxerre
under
the
especial
care
of
his
brother
the
bishop
of
that
city
louis
quatorze
made
it
one
of
his
splendid
caprices
and
not
only
set
the
example
but
forced
the
fashion
into
this
luxurious
and
extravagant
channel
in
spain
lace
was
made
to
look
its
best
by
being
worn
stretched
over
the
great
hoops
of
the
and
the
fashion
spread
all
over
europe
the
white
laces
resembling
carved
ivory
or
those
in
gold
and
silver
which
remind
one
of
solid
jewellers
work
when
spread
over
the
surface
of
these
fortified
outworks
guarding
from
all
approach
the
persons
of
the
infantas
of
spain
assume
in
the
portraits
by
velasquez
a
dignity
which
is
in
keeping
with
their
value
the
splendid
designs
show
brilliantly
on
a
background
of
scarlet
rose
colour
or
black
silk
and
that
which
hanging
loosely
looks
only
tawdry
and
ragged
had
a
magnificent
effect
when
thus
displayed
for
ecclesiastical
purposes
these
grand
solid
laces
seem
most
appropriate
being
effective
in
large
spaces
and
easily
seen
at
a
distance
hanging
over
the
edge
of
the
altar
as
a
border
to
the
linen
cloths
or
finishing
the
white
alb
of
the
officiating
priest
one
can
not
but
agree
with
blanc
who
points
out
that
each
piece
of
lace
had
its
intention
and
that
a
fashionable

in
false
taste
to
say
no
worse
of
the

we
have

no

amusement

laces
still
we
must
confess
we
have
no
national
style
of
lace
and
the
only
enduring
ones
have
been
those
of
france
and
belgium
which
have
always
kept
the
lead
since
their
establishment
though
fluctuating
in
design
with
the
varying
fashions
of
each
epoch
perhaps
the
reason
of
their
longevity
is
that
they
have
followed
always
the
taste
of
their
day
that
of
our
time
being
decidedly
archæological
ancient
patterns
are
now
the

called

to
be
only
made
in
ireland

the

how
widespread
have
been
the
efforts
of
irish
ladies
to
employ
the
peculiar
genius
of
the
sister
island
for
delicate
work
with
the
needle
which
has
always
been
shown
in
their
beautiful
embroideries

it
appears
that
every
kind
of

except
perhaps
brussels

has
been
made
in

but
as
in

case
the
effort
was
always
that
of

away

tapestry
opus
pectineum
it
is
necessary
to
define
precisely
what
is
meant
by
the
word
tapestry
the
term
has
been
applied
to
all
hangings
and
so
caused
confusion
between
those
that
are
embroidered
with
a
design
on
a
plain
or
brocaded
woven
material
and
those
which
are
inwoven
with
the
design
from
the
first
this
latter
was
called
in
classical
language
opus
pectineum
because
it
was
woven
with
the
help
of
a
comb
the
slay
to
push
the
threads
tight
between
each
row
of
stitches
and
the
individual
stitches
were
put
in
with
a
sort
of
a
needle
or
by
the
fingers
only
and
laid
on
the
warp
it
was
thus
practised
by
the
egyptians
by
the
persians
indians
and
peruvians
and
in
egypt
was
often
finished
by
embroidery
pl
in
egyptian
tombs
we
have
evidence
of
their
tapestry
from
the
mural
paintings
representing
men
and
women
weaving
pictures
in
upright
looms
the
comb
which
served
to
push
the
threads
together
after
the
stitches
were
laid
in
is
sometimes
found
in
the
weaver
tomb
we
have
in
the
british
museum
pieces
of
opus
pectineum
from
saccarah
in
egypt
and
also
fragments
from
a
peruvian
tomb
of
barbarous
design
but
the
weaving
is
equal
to
the
egyptian
and
both
resemble

gobelins

whence
came

craft

woven
in

is
peculiar

the

i
shall
not
enter
into
any
description
of
the
mode
of
working
the

as
this
has
been
thoroughly
well
done
by
masters

for

i

to

regarding

weaving
i
must
acknowledge
my
indebtedness
to
albert
bibliothèque
des
merveilles
he
has
given
great
care
to
the
consideration
of
this
subject
and
has
collected
good
evidences
to
prove
his
conclusions
which
i
willingly
accept
of
course
he
has
chiefly
dealt
with
the
french
branch
of
the
art
and
with
the
flemish
from
which
it
immediately
descends
he
begins
however
by
quoting
pliny
to
prove
the
antiquity
of
weaving
and
gives
a
verse
of
martial
to
this
effect
thou
owest
this
work
to
the
land
of
memphis
where
the
slay
of
the
nile
has
vanquished

of

homer
makes
helen
weave
the
story
of
the
siege
of
troy
this
may
have
been
partly
embroidered
and
there
are
some
pieces
of
woven
tapestry
introduced
most
ingeniously
into
the
web
of
a
linen
shirt
or
garment
of
which
the
sleeve
is
in
the
egyptian
department
of
the
british
museum
proving
that
figures
were
pictured
by
weaving
quite
as
early
as
the
date
of
troy
and
unmistakably
finished
with
the
needle
plate
at
any
rate
as
early
as
the
days
of
homer
arachne
web
was
interwoven
with
figures
she
and
minerva
rivalled
each
other
in
ingenious
design
and
perfect
execution
the
description
of
the
beautiful
hangings
they
wove
the
glorious
colours
with
their
tenderly
graduated
tints
and
the
graceful
borders
appear
to
be
almost
prophetic
of
the
highest
efforts
of
the
looms
of
the
gobelins
arachne
name
is
derived
from
the
hebrew
word
for
weaving
arag
it
appears
that
the
town
now
called
arras
but
anciently
nomenticum
was
always
a
centre
of
the
trade
of
the
weavers
for
flavius
vopiscus
writing
in
says
that
thence
came
the
byrri
woven
cloaks
with
hoods
which
were
much
in
vogue
amongst
all
classes
in
the
later
roman
empire
the
craft
of
weaving
which
flourished
in
the
flemish
and
other
adjacent
countries
seems
to
have
become
native
to
that
soil
and
to
have
clung
to
it
surviving
many
historical
cataclysms
though
in
the
fifth
century
the
inhabitants
of
that
country
were
transported
wholesale
to
germany
by
the
vandals
and
among
them
those
of
the
town
of
arras
yet
thanks
to
the
monasteries
there
was
a
survival
and
a
revival
the
craftsmen
grouping
themselves
round
the
religious
houses
specimens
as
models
were
brought
from
the
east
aster
bishop
of
amasis
a
town
in
asiatic
turkey
describes
these
oriental
hangings
in
one
of
his
homilies
he
says
that
animals
and
scenes
from
the
bible
were
woven
on
white
grounds
sidonius
apollinaris
bishop
of
clermont
ferrand
says
that
some
foreign
tapestries
are
pictured
with
the
summits
of
ctesiphon
and
nephates
wild
beasts
running
rapidly
across
void
canvas
and
also
by
a
miracle
of
art
the
parthian
of
wild
aspect
with
his
head
turned
backwards
this
might
be
a
description
of
a
chinese
composition
and
probably
it
is
so
woven
tapestry
is
also
called
arras
because
that
town
in
the
netherlands
was
the
home
and
school
of
the
art
of
picture
weaving
in
the
middle
ages
it
has
been
hitherto
excluded
from
the
domain
of
needlework
because
of
the
different
use
of
the
needle
employed
in
it
it
has
always
been
woven
on
a
loom
and
is
in
fact
embroidery
combined
with
the
weaving
for
the
shuttle
or
slay
or
comb
completes
each
row
of
stitches
it
belongs
as
much
to
our
art
as
does
tambour
work
which
is
done
with
a
hook
instead
of
a
needle
tapestry
weaving
is
the
intelligent
craft
of
a
practised
hand
guided
by
artistic
skill
the
forms
of
the
painted
design
must
be
copied
by
a
person
who
can
draw
and
the
colours
require
as
much
care
in
selection
as
in
painting
with
oils
or
such
a
thing
as
a
purely
mechanical
exact
copy
is
impossible
in
any
art
and
the
difficulties
are
increased
a
hundredfold
when
it
is
a
translation
into
another
material
and
another
form
of
art
besides
in
this
case
the
copies
are
worked
from
the
back
and
the
picture
is
reversed
the
question
is
this
can
it
be
claimed
as
belonging
to
the
same
craft
as
embroidery
i
answer
in
the
affirmative
and
i
claim
it
when
the
saracens
began
to
weave
tapestry
we
can
not
tell
but
the
workers
in
woven
pictures
were
called
sarassins
and
their
craft
the
saracenicum
the
french
and
flemish
artisans
who
continued
to
weave
in
the
old
upright
frames
were
whether
christians
or
not
called
sarassins
probably
they
came
through
spain
possibly
from
sicily
to
flanders
and
to
france
or
else
from
byzantium
says
that
the
saracinois
was
a
term
applied
to
the
makers
of
velvety
carpets
this
is
possible
woven
carpets
of
oriental
type
were
spreading
themselves
as
articles
of
luxury
through
europe
early
in
the
middle
ages
and
the
persian
style
of
design
was
much
the
same
then
when
the
first
models
were
brought
to
spain
and
thence
to
arras
as
it
is
now
in
the
carpets
we
buy
just
woven
in
persia
the
oldest
specimens
known
here
have
been
exhibited
in
the
indian
museum
and
may
be
of
the
thirteenth
and
fourteenth
centuries
the
perishable
nature
of
the
material
makes
us
dependent
on
the
sculptured
records
of
all
artistic
design
for
our
knowledge
of
carpets
and
hangings
of
more
than
a
thousand
years
ago
and
we
must
confess
that
we
find
nothing
really
resembling
a
persian
pattern
in
any
classical
tomb
or
sculpture
of
the
dark
ages
i
have
allowed
myself
to
touch
upon
carpet
weaving
as
it
is
germane
to
tapestry
though
it
is
a
branch
that
soon
loses
itself
and
leaves
artistic
work
in
the
distance
except
the
first
design
it
has
become
purely
mechanical
after
what
has
been
quoted
from
ovid
metamorphoses
and
bearing
in
mind
the
pictured
webs
described
by
homer
and
likewise
the
evidence
of
the
frescoes
in
egypt
and
the
woman
weaving
on
the
greek
fictile
vase
found
at
chiusi
we
may
be
justified
in
concluding
that
like
all
other
arts
that
of
tapestry
existed
in
very
early
days
died
out
and
had
to
begin
afresh
and
gradually
return
to
life
during
the
middle
ages

be

and
i
must
refer
my

to
the
authorities
i
have
quoted
from
so
largely
italian
tapestry
the
word
arrazzi
shows
us
whence
the
italians
drew
their
art
doubtless
there
were
looms
in
the
italian
cities
and
especially
under
ecclesiastical
patronage
through
the
dark
ages
rome
was
in
communication
with
the
atrebates
in
the
third
century
by
whom
she
was
supplied
with
the
byrri
or
hooded
cloaks
then
worn
and
as
it
had
been
a
centre
for
weaving
commerce
it
is
probable
that
rome
received
from
arras
the
craftsmen
as
well
as
the
produce
of
their
looms
at
the
renaissance
we
find
factories
for
pictured
webs
in
florence
rome
milan
mantua
and
elsewhere
the
best
artists
of
the
italian
schools
mantegna
leonardo
raphael
and
his
scholars
gave
their
finest
designs
to
be
executed
in
italy
before
they
were
sold
to
arras
brussels
france
or
england
and
they
are
accumulated
in
the
of
every
palace
in
italy
but
the
finest
collections
are
those
of
the
vatican
and
of
the
pitti
in
florence
a
splendid
volume
might
be
edited
of
these
grand
artistic
works
such
a
record
would
be
invaluable
vasari

passevant
give
us
occasional
glimpses
of
local
factories

but
as
we
have
before
said
this
subject
has
still
to
be
investigated
french
tapestry
in
france
as
elsewhere
tapestry
was
probably
woven
in
private
looms
and
in
the
religious
houses

early
days

it
was

at
poitiers
troyes
beauvais
rheims
and
quentin
as
early
as
froissart
describes
the
entry
of
isabel
of
bavaria
as
a
bride
into
paris
when
the
houses
were
covered
with
hangings
and
tapestries
representing
historical
scenes
the
cluny
museum
possesses
a
most
curious
mediæval
suite
of
hangings
from
the
chateau
de
boussac
of
the
early
part
of
the
fifteenth
century
they
tell
the
story
of
the
dame
au
lion
and
are
brilliantly
coloured
and
charmingly
quaint
and
gay
in
design
hangings
designed
by
primaticcio
were
woven
at
fontainebleau
where
francis
started
the
manufacture
in
however
the
first
national
school
of
tapestry
weaving
was
that
at
chaillot
under
the
experienced
teaching
of
workmen
from
arras
afterwards
transferred
to
the
town
of
gobelins
by
henri
quatre
louis
quatorze
and
his
minister
colbert
splendidly
protected
this
manufacture
by
law
privilege
and
employment
so
did
louis
quinze
before
the
revolution
other
considerable
tapestry
works
were
flourishing
at
aubusson
in
auvergne
at
felletin
in
the
upper
marches
and
at
beauvais
these
two
last
were
especially
famed
for
velvety
tapestries
as
usual
the
french
have
surpassed
all
other
nations
in
this
textile
art
the
pictorial
tapestries
of
the
gobelins
have
carried
the
beauty
of
wall
hangings
to
the
utmost
perfection
nothing
can
be
more
festive
than
a
brilliantly
lighted
hall
glowing
with
these
woven
pictures
or
arabesques
framed
in
gilded
carvings
or
stuccoes
still
we
must
acknowledge
that
in
choice
of
worthy
subjects
the
flemish
ideal
which
had
been
left
far
behind
was
the
highest
the
weavers
of
the
time
of
louis
quatorze
aspired
only
to
teach
the
glories
of
france
not
the
moralities
of
society
and
civilization
in
their
historical
compositions
which
were
then
superseded
by
classical
mythology
or
else
by
scenes
from
rustic
life
of
the
watteau
school
la
fables
gave
some
of
the
prettiest
and
gayest
designs
and
were
generally
the
centres
of
splendid
arabesques
the
drawing
and
execution
were
perfect
it
is
to
be
feared
that
in
the
future
great
works
of
textile
decoration
will
be
few
and
far
between
it
is
only
when
the
state
or
the
monarch
that
represents
the
dignity
of
the
state
protects
and
fosters
these
artistic
factories
that
they
can
continue
to
thrive
without
such
powerful
encouragement
fashion
commercial
depression
or
a
war
will
stop
for
a
time
the
orders
without
which
funds
fail
discouragement
sets
in
and
ruin
quickly
follows
and
the
best
workman
when
unemployed
or
forced
for
some
years
to
wield
the
sword
loses
his
practised
skill
never
to
be
restored
in
france
whatever
has
been
the
form
of
government
the
old
traditions
of
protection
for
the
gobelins
have
been
acted
up
to
and
maintained
the
consequence
is
that
science
and
art
still
contribute
their
efforts
in
the
machinery
the
colouring
and
the
designing
of
hangings
of
which
the
materials
and
the
execution
are
unrivalled
probably
there
will
never
again
be
a
tuileries
or
a
versailles
to
adorn
but
an
hôtel
de
ville
especially
if
it
is
occasionally
destroyed
may
give
from
time
to
time
opportunity
for
such
decorations
english
tapestry
when
we
consider
the
antiquity
and
the
excellence
of
the
art
of
tapestry
on
the
continent
we
can
not
pretend
that
there
can
be
the
same
general
interest
in
that
of
our
english
looms
but
to
ourselves
it
naturally
assumes
the
greatest
importance
and
i
have
tried
to
trace
the
efforts
of
our
ancestors
in
this
direction
by
noting
every
certain
sign
of
english
production
in
what
must
have
been
an
imitation
of
flemish
or
oriental
weaving
the
few
facts
here
collected
may
be
of
service
to
the
future
writer
of
the
history
of
english
tapestries
comnenus
prince
of
arras
fled
before
the
romans
from
nomenticum
to
england
and
he
and
his
atrebates
settled
themselves
between
silchester
and
sarum
and
the
belgæ
and
parisi
did
the
same
the
romans
found
them
here
when
they
invaded
england
wherever
the
belgic
tribes
spread
themselves
the
art
of
weaving
was
established
comnenus
probably
brought
over
and
left
to
his
descendants
the
inheritance
of
this
craft
rock
thinks
that
pictured
tapestry
was
woven
at
an
early
period
in
the
middle
ages
by
the
monks
in
england
the
earliest
proof
of
this
that
we
possess
is
the
notice
by
matthew
paris
thirteenth
century
describing
the
three
reredos
for
alban
abbey
the
first
a
large
one
depicting
the
finding
of
the
body
of
the
protomartyr
the
others
the
prodigal
son
and
the
man
who
fell
among
thieves
all
these
were
executed
by
the
orders
of
abbot
geoffrey
while
in
london
in
simon
abbot
of
ramsay
bought
for
the
use
of
his

in
edward
ii
time
there
were
hangings
woven
in
england
which
appear
to
have
been
absolutely
tapestries
they
were
much
valued
abroad
and
were
called

our
trade
with
arras
must
have
improved
our
tapestries
we
are
told
of
edward
iii
selling
his
wools
to
that
town
and
being
therefore
called
by
philip
de
valois
his
marchant
de
laine
horace
walpole
refers
to
an
act
de

of
the
time
of
edward
regarding
certain
malpractices
of
the
craft
which
proves
its
existence
in
england
at
that
period
french
in
his
catalogue
of
the
exhibition
in
london
quotes
the
tapestries
of
mary
hall
at
coventry
to
prove
that
there
was
a
manufactory
in
england
henry
vi
there
were
certainly
individual
looms
though
we
doubt
whether
it
had
yet
become
a
national
industry
as
we
have
so
few
specimens
remaining
the
tapestries
contain
portraits
of
henry
cardinal
beaufort
and
are
probably
contemporary
works
the
subject
is
the
marriage
of
henry
vi
there
is
also
a
piece
of
tapestry
at
bude
in
cornwall
the
property
of
maskell
which
came
from
a
royal
sale
here
the
marriage
of
henry
vii
is
depicted
and
the
style
resembles
that
of
the
coventry
hangings
the
costumes
are
certainly
english
and
the
original
pictures
must
have
been
english
though
they
might
have
been
wrought
at
arras
reminding
one
of
the
groups
of
figures
and
the
dresses
on
the
dunstable
pall
see
plate
rock
also
quotes
the
reredos
belonging
to
the
vintners
company
representing
martin
sharing
his
cloak
with
a
beggar
he
thinks
this
is
executed
by
the
monks
of
alban
and
attributes
to
those
of
canterbury
the
fine
tapestries
of
the
legends
of
the
virgin
at
aix
in
provence
of
which
we
have
the
history
they
were
originally
given
to
canterbury
cathedral
by
prior
godstone
and
were
called
arras
work
there
is
no
doubt
that
there
were
looms
and
artists
in
the
convents
and
monasteries
before
there
was
any
recognized
school
of
such
work
in
england
probably
till
the
reformation
such
hangings
were
being
woven
all
over
europe
and
only
then
ceased
in
germany
and
england
one
can
not
but
regret
that
the
weight
of
the
evil
which
preponderated
over
the
good
in
the
houses
of
the
church
should
have
caused
so
much
that
was
beautiful
in
art
to
be
crushed
by
their
ruin
chaucer
speaks
of
tapestry
of
verd
this
green
tapestry
seems
to
have
been
intended
to
give
a
bowery
effect
to
the
room
it
hung
and
one
can
imagine
that
it
pleased
the
taste
of
the
poet
of
the
flower
and
the
leaf
it
seems
to
have
been
much
the
fashion
in
england
and
elsewhere
about
that
period
and
generally
represented
landscapes
and
woody
foregrounds
only
but
sometimes
figures
and
animals
were
portrayed
and
always
in
the
same
tints
of
rock
gives
us
an
extract
from
the
wardrobe
accounts
of
edward
containing
the
following
items
to
a
mercer
of
london
for
a
green
hanging
of
wool
woven
with
figures
of
kings
and
earls
upon
it
for
the
king
service
upon
solemn
feast
days
in
london
therefore
the
tapestry
of
verd
was
not
a
novelty
even
in
the
time
of
chaucer
oudenarde
was
famous
for
these
hallings
or
salles
all
the
specimens
mentioned
in
the
catalogue
of
tapestries
exhibited
at
brussels
in
are
said
to
be
from
thence
but
we
see
no
reason
why
it
should
not
have
been
an
english
style
of
weaving
also
the
first
establishment
of
a
permanent
manufactory
in
england
did
not
however
take
place
until
the
latter
end
of
the
reign
of
henry
when
robert
sheldon
allowed
his
at
barcheston
in
warwickshire
to
one
hicks
whom
he
signalizes
in
his
will
as
the
author
and
beginner
of
all

of

in
england
this
will

henry

at
hatfield
there
are
four
pieces
of
tapestry
representing
the
seasons
removed
from
an
old
family
house
and
placed
by
lord
salisbury
at
hatfield
house
where
they
hang
in
the
great
corridor
these
were
probably
woven
in
barcheston
plate
the
style
is
english
renaissance
and
the
design
full
of
intention
in
fact
they
have
the
seal
of
the
time
of
henry
viii
only
one
characteristic
reminds
one
of
flemish
art
and
that
is
the
mode
of
drawing
the
plants
and
flowers
which
might
have
been
taken
out
of
an
old
german
herbal
the
landscapes
and
peasantry
are
unmistakably
english
the
pictures
are
worked
with
strong
black
outlines
which
emphasize
every
detail
and
give
the
effect
of
a
highly
coloured
outlined
engraving
reminding
one
of
the
children
books
by
marcus
ward
or
by
walter
crane
the
tapestries
called
the
spanish
armada
hangings
were
probably
woven
here
late
in
elizabeth
reign
in
her
time
we
find
in
catalogues
of
household
goods
descriptions
of
splendid
hangings
furnishings
of
palaces
and
private
houses
the
inventory
of
the
earl
of
leicester
belongings
in
the
library
at
longleat
astonishes
us
with
the
abundance
of
suites
of
hangings
of
tapestry
that
it
enumerates
as
well
as
those
embroidered
by
hand
and
others
of
stamped
and
painted
leather
it
was
in
the
reign
of
james
that
the
manufacture
was
set
up
at
mortlake
in
surrey
aubrey
in
his
history
of
surrey
however
dates
the
institution
in
the
subsequent
reign
but
lloyd
is
not
only
positive
for
the
former
date
but
affirms
it
was
of
the
motion
of
king
james
himself
who
gave
towards
the
undertaking
and
we
have
further
proofs
extant
that
he
spent
largely
and
encouraged
it
in
every
way
he
gave
to
sir
francis
crane
who
erected
the
house
at
mortlake
the
making
of
three
baronets
towards
his
project
for
manufacture
of
tapestry
another
curious
item
which
we
quote
shows
that
the
funds
for
the
enterprise
were
not
easily
forthcoming
it
is
a
warrant
to
sir
francis
crane
to
be
employed
in
buying
per
ann
of
pensions
or
other
gifts
made
of
the
king
and
not
yet
payable
for
ease
of
his
majesty
charge
of
a
year
towards
the
maintenance
of
sir
francis
crane
tapestry
manufacture
apparently
this
little
arrangement
did
not
succeed
for
there
is
an
acknowledgment
by
charles
in
the
first
year
of
his
reign
that
he
is
in
debt
to
sir
crane
for
three
suits
of
gold
tapestry
we
stand
indebted
to
sir
francis
crane
also
sir
crane
is
allowed
annually
for
the
better
maintenance
of
said
works
for
ten
years
to
come
the
king
also
granted
the
estate
of
stoke
bruere
near
stamford
in
northamptonshire
as
part
payment
of
due
to
him
on
the
tapestry
works
at
mortlake
the
great
value
of
these
tapestries
is
shown
by
the
prices
named
in
the
domestic
papers
of
the
state
paper
office
and
in
private
inventories
they
were
woven
in
silk
wool
and
gold
which
last
item
accounts
both
for
their
price
and
for
their
disappearance
william
archbishop
of
york
and
lord
keeper
gave
for
four
pieces
of
arras
representing
the
four
seasons
their
value
however
fell
during
the
civil
wars
for
the
tapestries
of
the
five
senses
from
the
palace
of
oatlands
which
were
from
the
mortlake
looms
were
sold
in
for
the
beautiful
tapestries
at
houghton
were
woven
at
mortlake
these
are
all
silk
and
contain
whole
length
portraits
of
james
and
charles
and
their
queens
with
heads
of
the
royal
children
in
the
borders
a
similar
hanging
is
at
knowle
wrought
in
silk
containing
portraits
of
vandyke
and
sir
francis
crane
francis
cleyne
was
a
decorator
and
painter
employed
in
the
works
at
mortlake
by
charles
who
while
he
was
still
prince
of
wales
brought
him
over
to

from

in
mecklenburg
his
native
place
while
the

was

in
grotesques
and
also
undertook
in
historical
designs
three
of
the
raphael
cartoons
were
sent
to
be
copied
at
mortlake
the
purchase
of
these
cartoons
by
the
king
showed
how
high
was
the
standard
to
which
he
tried
to
raise
the
art
in
england
the
triumph
of
cæsar
by
mantegna
was
obtained
for
the
same
purpose
in
and
certain
dutch
prisoners
were
forwarded
to
the
manufactory
to
be
employed
on
the
work
it
was
entrusted
to
the
care
of
sir
gilbert
pickering

was
either
an
artist
or
the
superintendent
of

after
the
death
of

francis
his
brother
sir
richard
crane
sold
the

to
charles
i
during
the
civil
wars
the
property
was
seized
upon
and
confiscated
as
having
belonged
to

gibson
the
dwarf
and

painter
who
had
been
page
to
a

at
mortlake
was
one
of
his
pupils
the
value
of
the

collection
of

was
well
understood
during

the

remained
in
the
occupation
of

the
after
the
restoration
charles
ii
appointed
verrio
as
designer
intending
to
revive
the
manufactory
this
was
not
however
carried
out
but
the
work
still
lingered
on
and
must
have
been
in
some
repute
for
evelyn
names
some
of
these
hangings
as
a
fit
present
among
those
offered
by
a
gallant
to
his
mistress
arras
is
said
to
have
been
woven
at
stamford
but
we
have
no
data
of
its
establishment
or
its
suppression
burleigh
house
contains
much
of
it
and
there
is
a
suite
of
hangings
at
belton
house
near
grantham
of
which
there
are
duplicates
at
wroxton
house
in
oxfordshire
all
having
the
same
traditional
origin
at
stamford
possibly
sir
francis
and
sir
richard
crane
may
have
received
orders
at
their
house
at
stoke
bruere
which
lay
near
enough
to
stamford
to
account
for
the
magnates
of
the
town
and
neighbourhood
obtaining
furnishings
of
their
tapestries
and
perhaps
vying
with
each
other
in
decorating
their
apartments
with
them
in
northumberland
house
there
was
a
fine
suite
of
tapestry
woven
in
lambeth
this
is
the
only
sample
of
that
loom
of
which
we
ever
find
any
mention
there
were
also
works
at
fulham
where
furniture
tapestry
in
the
style
of
beauvais
was
made
this
manufactory
was
closed
in
it
may
be
hoped
that
the
revival
of
tapestry
weaving
at
windsor
in
our
own
day
may
be
a
success
but
without
the
royal
and
noble
encouragement
it
receives
it
would
probably
very
soon
fall
into
disuse
unless
it
is
supported
by
the
state
such
an
exceptionally
expensive
machinery
can
not
possibly
be
kept
at
work
it
requires
the
superintendence
of
the
best
artists
and
the
weavers
themselves
must
needs
have
the
highest
technical
education
to
enable
them
to
copy
really
fine
designs
these
artistic
requirements
besides
the
extreme
tediousness
of
the
work
make
it
the
most
expensive
of
all
luxurious
decorations
even
more
costly
than
embroideries
by
the
hand
covering
the
same
spaces
however
the
two
styles
of
hangings
never
can
enter
into
competition
except
in
a
financial
point
of
view
tapestries
are
the
best
fitted
for
wall
coverings
and

we

enemies

to

antiquity
tapestry
as
art
has
its
own
peculiar
beauties
and
one
of
them
is
the
softening
yet
brilliant
effect
of
the
alternate
lights
and
shadows
of
the
surface
the
separation
of
each
stitch
and
thread
also
casting
minute
shadows
in
the
opposite
direction
and
giving
an
iridescent
effect
it
is
a
mistake
to
struggle
against
this
inherent
quality
instead
of
seeking
to
utilize
it
the
coarser
and
simpler
tapestries
of
our
ancestors
are
really
more
beautiful
and
effective
in
large
spaces
flat
in
the
arrangement
of
colours
and
sharply
outlined
than
the
imitations
of
paintings
of
the
last
two
centuries
in
which
every
detail
of
form
and
colour
is
sought
to
be
expressed
blanc
says
that
tapestries
were
intended
to
cover
the
bare
walls
but
not
to
make
us
forget
their
existence
the
wall
being
intended
for
comfort
and
defence
the
mind
is
solaced
with
the
idea
it
conveys
it
is
a
mistake
therefore
to
substitute
a
surface
picture
so
real
that
it
at
once
does
away
with
this
impression
of
security
while
a
certain
conventional
art
should
amuse
the
mind
with
shadowy
representations
and
suggestions
it
is
perhaps
fortunate
that
the
possibilities
of
tapestry
weaving
are
restricted
and
thus
its
very
imperfections
become
the
sources
of
its
best
qualities
as
decoration
and
comfort
one
element
of
textile
weaving
the
use
of
gold
both
in
the
backgrounds
and
in
the
draperies
takes
it
at
once
out
of
the
region
of
naturalism
while
giving
it
light
and
splendour
the
designer
for
tapestry
need
not
be
a
great
genius
harmony
repose
grace
and
tender
colouring
are
the
qualities
most
valuable
to
such
an
artist
and
other
exciting
and
awful
subjects
are
only
bearable
in
apartments
that
are
used
for
state
occasions
or
for
hanging
corridors
and
anterooms
they
are
painful
to
live
with
all
tapestries
are
liable
to
suffer
by
the
double
nature
of
their
materials
their
woollen
surface
and
linen
threads
which
are
affected
by
both
damp
and
heat
crinkling
the
forms
and
puckering
the
faces
and
bringing
out
unexpected
expressions
and
deformities
for
this
reason
the
design
should
be
as
flat
and
as
simple
in
its
outline

though

speaks
of
the

if

his

thus
i

no
reason
to

that
the
word
guipure
is
derived
from

a
term
for
spinning
one
thread
round
another
and
that
guipure
was
originally
more
like
what
we
now
call
or
like
de

made
of
thread
of
more

less
thickness

connected

have
ceased
to
exist
we
have
very
ancient
historical
evidence
of
the
use
of
hangings
or
tapestries
either
as
curtains
to
exclude
prying
eyes
or
as
coverings
to
what
was
sacred
or
else
unseemly
or
as
ornamental
backgrounds
in
public
and
private
buildings
there
is
no
doubt
that
in
pillared
spaces
the
enclosures
and
subdivisions
were
completed
by
hangings
from
pillar
to
pillar
from
the
earliest
times
of
asiatic
civilization
in
assyria
and
afterwards
in
greece
and
rome
the
open
courts
and
rooms
were
shaded
from
the
sun
and
rain
by
erections
with
hangings
stretched
over
them
from
the
coliseum
vast
area
to
that
of
the
smallest
atrium
in
the
pompeian
house
the
covering
principle
was
the
same
and
temples
alike
were
furnished
in
this
way
and
the
cold
splendour
of
the
polished
marbles
was
enhanced
by
contrast
with
the
shadowing
folds
of
soft
textures
richly
embroidered
in
bright
colours
and
gold
the
statues
the
gold
and
silver
vessels
the
shrines
heaped
with
votive
offerings
were
all
brought
into
higher
relief
and
effect
by
the
screens
the
curtains
and
the
veils
which
classical
perfect
taste
would
plan
so
as
to
carry
out
the
intention
babylonians
persians
assyrians
egyptians
greeks
and
jews
each
adorned
their
sacred
places
in
similar
fashions
clemens
alexandrinus
says
that
behind
the
hangings
of
the
egyptian
temples
were
hidden
their
foolish
images
the
word
hangings
was
applied
to
all
large
curtains
and
tapestries
tent
coverings
screens
dividing
empty
spaces
or
pendant
between
pillars
also
sails
banners
and
decorations
for
processional
purposes
covering
walls
or
hanging
from
windows
all
these
have
been
embroidered
or
woven
with
pictures
and
patterns
carpets
from
having
originally
the
same
name
tapete
are
to
be
added
to
this
list
and
in
fact
their
uses
are
often
interchanged
kosroes
famous
hangings
were
used
as
a
carpet
and
persian
and
babylonian
carpets
have
been
hung
on
the
walls
a
babylonian
hanging
must
have
resembled
in
its
style
of
which
we
have
descriptions
the
persian
carpet
of
semper
gives
excellent
reasons
for
his
theory
that
next
to
dress
hangings
the
clothing
of
architecture
were
the
earliest
phase
of
art
he
looks
upon
the
most
ancient
paintings
on
architecture
as
absolutely
representing
textile
coverings
some
of
the
earliest
babylonian
decorations
show
men
supporting
draperies
which
he
believes
to
be
the
tradition
of
the
time
when
the
tallest
slaves
held
up
the
hangings
to
their
own
height
and
above
them
in
tiers
were
men
dwarfs
and
even
children
fastened
on
brackets
carrying
the
hangings
up
to
the
roofs
this
was
an
assyrian
custom
and
was
adopted
by
the
romans
as
a
mode
of
disposing
of
their
prisoners
of
war
woltmann
and
woermann
appear
to
lean
to
the
suggestion
that
permanent
imitations
of
hangings
were
carried
out
in
painted
or
encaustic
tiles
covering
the
masonry
of
chaldean
buildings
at
nimroud
and
khorsabad
the
pale
ones
associated
with
low
reliefs
and
really
resembling
them
as
they
were
partly
raised
and
the
reliefs
in
alabaster
and
stone
which
were
partly
coloured
were
in
harmony
and
yet
in
contrast
with
the
brilliant
tiles
of
babylon
we
know
exactly
what
were
the
purple
scarlet
and
white
hangings
of
the
sanctuary
in
the
wilderness
designed
by
bezaleel
and
that
the
veil
of
the
temple
was
blue
purple
crimson
or
scarlet
and
white
worked
on
white
linen
and
we
know
from
josephus
that
the
veil
of
the
temple
which
was
rent
in
twain
sixteen
centuries
later
was
that
dedicated
by
herod
and
was
babylonian
work
representing
heaven
and
earth
see
its
colouring
was
scarlet
white
and
blue
scarlet
and
white
hangings
seem
indeed
to
have
been
an
oriental
fashion
and
fashion
then
was
not
ephemeral
but
lasted
hundreds
of
years
the
embroidered
curtains
of
the
tabernacle
are
repeated
in
the
hangings
of
alexander
wedding
tent
after
years
and
a
thousand
years
later
still
they
reappear
in
the
seventh
century
when
pope
sergius
gave
curtains
to
the
high
altar
baldachino
in
the
basilica
of
peter
at
rome
of
this
same
scarlet
and
white
embroidery
in
early
oriental
art
the
enormous
expenditure
of
work
is
appalling
to
think
of
abulfeda
describes
the
palace
of
the
caliph
moctader
on
the
banks
of
the
tigris
as
being
adorned
with
pieces
of
tapestry
and
of
these
were
of
silk
worked
in
gold
what
a
wealth
of
women
had
to
be
wasted
in
creating
such
a
wealth
of
embroideries
there
is
a
bedouin
romance
which
describes
the
tent
of
antar
and
shows
the
taste
for
large
works
five
thousand
horsemen
could
skirmish
under
its
embroidered
shade
and
akbar
largest
tent
held
persons
nadir
shah
gorgeous
tent
which
was
of
the
end
of
the
seventeenth
and
the
beginning
of
the
eighteenth
century
was
of
scarlet
cloth
on
the
outside
lined
with
violet
satin
embroidered
with
gold
and
precious
stones
the
peacock
throne
was
placed
within
it
and
was
kept
there
during
the
remainder
of
nadir
shah
reign
sir
john
chardin
says
that
the
khan
of
persia
caused
a
tent
to
be
made
which
cost
two
millions
they
called
it
the
house
of
gold
and
it
was
resplendent
with
embroideries
these
are
comparatively
modern
works
and
sound
commonplace
and
vulgar
compared
to
those
of
greece
and
egypt
the
greeks
imitated
the
tents
and
temporary
buildings
of
the
eastern
monarchs
this
phase
of
oriental
luxury
was
imported
by
alexander
the
great
and
we
have
the
description
of
two
of
his
gorgeous
creations
at
alexandria
where
he
outrivalled
the
ancient
traditional
glories
of
assyria
and
persia
his
own
tent
was
supported
by
fifty
golden
pillars
carrying
a
roof
of
woven
gold
embroidered
in
shimmering
colours
and
divided
from
the
surrounding
court
filled
with
guards
and
retainers
by
scarlet
and
white
curtains
of
splendid
material
and
design
but
more
gorgeous
is
the
account
of
the
tent
in
which
he
entertained
of
his
on
the
occasion
of
his
marriage
this
tent
was
supported
by
columns
twenty
cubits
high
plated
with
silver
and
gold
and
inlaid
with
precious
stones
the
walls
of
the
court
were
formed
by
curtains
adorned
with
figures
worked
in
gold
and
were
hung
from
beams
plated
with
the
precious
metals
to
match
the
columns
the
outer
court
was
half
a
mile
in
circumference
yet
alexander
was
exceeded
in
splendour
by
that
erected
by
ptolemy
philadelphus
for
his
great
pomp
at
alexandria
described
by
kallixenos
as
cited
by
athenæus
this
tent
crowned
with
golden
eagles
was
supported
by
pillars
fifty
cubits
high
they
upheld
an
architrave
with
covered
with
linen
on
which
were
painted
coffers
to
imitate
the
structure
of
a
solid
roof
from
the
centre
was
suspended
a
veil
of
scarlet
bordered
with
white
the
pillars
in
the
four
angles
represented
of
gold
and
the
intermediate
columns
were
fashioned
as
thursi
and
were
probably
wreathed
with
golden
vines
and
bunches
of
grapes
made
of
amethysts
as
we
know
of
a
persian
tent
so
adorned
and
the
whole
idea
of
the
erection
was
evidently
fresh
from
the
east
a
frieze
eight
cubits
high
was
composed
of
niches
containing
groups
of
tragic
comic
and
satyric
figures
in
their
natural
garb
and
nymphs
and
golden
tripods
from
delphi
the
tent
was
separated
from
the
outer
peristyle
by
scarlet
hangings
covered
with
choice
skins
of
wild
beasts
upon
these
were
hung
the
celebrated
sikyonian
pictures
the
heritage
of
the
ptolemaic
dynasty
alternating
with
portraits
and
rich
hangings
on
which
were
embroidered
the
likenesses
of
kings
and
likewise
mythological
subjects
between
these
and
the
frieze
hung
gold
and
silver
shields
opposite
the
entrance
vessels
of
the
most
costly
materials
and
workmanship
valued
at
talents
of
silver
were
ranged
so
as
to
strike
the
eye
of
all
who
entered
there
golden
couches
supported
by
sphinxes
were
placed
along
the
sides
of
the
tent
furnished
with
soft
purple
woollen
mattresses
and
coverings
gaily
and
exquisitely
embroidered
the
floor
was
strewn
with
fresh
blossoms
except
where
a
most
costly
persian
carpet
covered
the
centre
in
the
doorways
and
against
the
pillars
stood
a
hundred
precious
statues
by
the
greatest
artists
this
description
dazzles
the
imagination
to
be
an
upholsterer
a
vestiarius
in
those
days
was
to
be
an
engineer
architect
and
artist
semper
from
whose
translation
we
are
quoting
remarks
that
the
luxurious
motive
of
such
an
erection
naturally
arose
from
the
desire
to
make
use
of
the
mass
of
artistic
materials
acquired
by
conquest
and
the
effort
to
reduce
them
to
certain
architectural
principles
already
accepted
that
alexander
did
not
purposely
destroy
the
persian
embroideries
is
evident
from
the
fact
that
lucullus
speaks
of
them
years
later
rome
accepted
and
adopted
all
the
oriental
uses
of
hangings
in
the
temple
and
the
house
for
temporary
festive
occasions
by
both
greeks
and
romans
hangings
were
used
in
triumphal
processions
covering
immense
moving
cars
or
draping
the
temporary
buildings
which
lined
the
avenues
of
their
progress
also
the
funeral
pyres
which
greece
and
rome
copied
from
assyria
were
hung
with
splendid
materials
and
embroideries
without
describing
one
of
these
awful
erections
it
is
impossible
to
give
any
idea
of
how
much
artistic
treasure
was
thrown
into
the
flames
which
consumed
the
remains
of
a
great
man
the
funeral
pyre
dedicated
by
alexander
to
his
friend
hephæstion
recalls
that
erected
by
sardanapalus
in
one
of
the
courts
of
his
own
palace
on
which
he
perished
surrounded
by
his
wives
and
his
treasures
hephæstion
catafalque
was
built
of
inflammable
materials
feet
high
raised
in
many
stories
and
hung
with
pictorial
tapestries
painted
and
embroidered
each
story
was
adorned
with
images
of
ivory
and
gold
in
the
upper
story
were
enormous
hollow
figures
of
sirens
filled
with
singers
who
chanted
the
funeral
odes
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
they
were
released
before
the
conflagration
the
records
of
such
extravagant
funeral
ceremonies
teach
us
how
much
of
human
thought
how
much
of
art
and
beauty
which
had
helped
to
civilize
the
world
were
torn
from
the
places
they
were
intelligently
designed
to
decorate
heaped
up
by
the
conquerors
and
as
ruthlessly
spent
and
destroyed
for
the
boast
of
a
day
christian
rome
adopted
the
traditions
of
pagan
decoration
and
introduced
them
in
her
worship
processions
and
shows
a
great
religious
procession
like
that
of
the
corpus
domini
in
our
own
times
has
reminded
us
of
a
roman
triumph
the
baldachini
and
the
banners
the
torches
the
streets
festooned
with
draperies
even
the
pagan
emblems
which
have
been
converted
into
christian
symbolism
all
these
were
the
echoes
of
classical
days
but
they
are
fast
disappearing
two
thousand
years
will
have
worn
out
and
effaced
these
customs
and
our
children
will
not
see
them
i
have
not
space
to
linger
over
the
many
descriptions
of
oriental
grecian
and
roman
work
to
be
gathered
from
classical
authors
but
from
them
this
lesson
is
to
be
learned
that
the
first
principle
which
guided
those
great
decorators
was
the
individuality
and
appropriateness
of
each
design
to
the
purpose
for
which
it
was
intended
and
the
place
it
was
to
fill
but
even
their
peculiar
excellences
did
not
save
them
from
the
universal
law
of
destruction
when
the
hangings
were
worn
or
became
for
any
reason
distasteful
they
were
replaced
by
others
often
by
gifts
or
spoils
from
friendly
allies
or
conquered
kings
the
quantity
of
gold
laid
upon
these
great
religious
or
national
works
was
the
cause
of
their
destruction
as
soon
as
they
were
withdrawn
and
superseded
by
something
of
a
newer
fashion
the
intrinsic
value
in
precious
metals
of
such
works
is
proved
by
pliny
statement
that
nero
gave
four
millions
of
sesterces
for
covers
of
couches
in
a
the
hangings
or
carpets
taken
by
the
caliph
omar
from
kosroes
white
palace
must
have
been
some
of
the
finest
and
most
valuable
embroideries
ever
known
they
formed
a
tapestry
carpet
or
hanging
representing
all
the
flowers
of
spring
worked
in
coloured
silks
gold
and
precious
stones
kosroes
entreated
omar
to
keep
it
intact
for
himself
but
he
was
so
virtuous
that
he
cut
it
up
into
little
bits
and
divided
it
amongst
his
generals
gibbon
describes
this
wonderful
piece
of
work
we
have
heard
much
of
a
marvellous
carpet
given
lately
by
the
guicowar
of
baroda
to
the
tomb
of
mahomet
at
medina
which
from
its
description
recalls
the
style
of
kosroes
hangings
and
their
history
gives
us
a
notable
instance
of
how
works
of
art
in
the
time
of
war
and
conquest
come
to
be
considered
only
for
the
value
of
their
materials
war
the
enemy
of
culture
all
but
effaces
whole
phases
of
art
when
a
country
is
overrun
and
plundered
but
there
is
almost
always
a
residuum
which
has
influence
whenever
there
is
a
revival
beginning
with
the
smaller
arts
of
luxury
in
more
peaceful
and
prosperous
days
to
return
to
the
classical
veils
and
hangings
you
may
see
them
on
babylonian
on
greek
fictile
vases
or
painted
in
frescoes
on
the
walls
of
egyptian
tombs
and
temples
in
the
houses
in
pompeii
and
herculaneum
and
in
the
remains
of
roman
villas
and
tombs
everywhere
from
all
of
these
we
may
learn
something
the
obvious
intention
of
hangings
in
household
decoration
is
to
cover
bare
walls
so
as
to
adorn
at
once
that
which
was
rough
or
common
without
delay
or
trouble
they
were
also
used
as
curtains
to
shut
out
the
cold
or
the
heat
and
to
give
privacy
to
rooms
without
doors
or
windows
hangings
on
bare
walls
have
always
been
meant
to
hang
straight
down
undisturbed
by
folds
whereas
curtains
and
portières
would
probably
have
to
be
looped
up
or
continually
drawn
aside
the
designs
to
be
worked
upon
them
should
necessarily
be
regulated
by
their
shape
and
use
semper
considers
that
a
square
is
an
expressionless
form
and
that
it
should
be
avoided
if
you
wish
to
give
dignity
to
a
room
its
hanging
decorations
should
be
divided
into
panels
of
greater
height
than
breadth
so
as
to
elevate
the
spaces
they
cover
horizontal
stripes
bring
down
the
ceiling
and
even
in
furniture
look
ill
except
as
borders
nothing
can
be
more
ugly
or
inartistic
than
the
curtains
one
finds
in
old
illuminations
covered
with
bands
of
the
same
pattern
throughout
the
surface
but
even
this
is
less
unpleasant
on
the
walls
than
lines
crossing
each
other
at
right
angles
the
romans
looked
on
chequers
as
barbarous
national
characteristics
and
left
them
to
the
gauls
and
britons
chequers
should
be
avoided
unless
they
express
a
meaning
as
in
scotch
tartans
semper
observes
that
the
striped
stuffs
especially
those
of
oriental
fabrics
were
never
intended
to
be
spread
out
flat
but
to
be
draped
in
folds
and
loops
and
the
lines
only
seen
broken
up
he
continues
one
rule
which
can
not
be
neglected
with
impunity
is
this
that
whether
the
hanging
or
screen
is
supposed
to
stand
or
to
hang
there
must
be
an
above
and
a
below
to
every
pattern
and
it
must
moreover
be
upright
all
foliage
designs
and
those
containing
animals
must
start
from
below
and
grow
upwards
another
of
his
laws
is
that
the
heaviest
colours
should
be
placed
below
and
the
palest
and
brightest
above
this
may
be
disputed
it
must
be
first
determined
where
contrast
is
needed
if
the
darkest
part
of
the
pattern
is
below
it
may
be
necessary
to
give
it
the
lightest
background
on
the
principle
of
balancing
quantities
in
colour
the
dado
or
lowest
border
will
often
give
the
necessary
weight
to
the
design
semper
goes
on
to
say
a
surface
may
be
made
to
appear
to
stand
or
to
hang
down
according
to
its
decoration
for
instance
a
triangle
will
hang
or
stand
according
as
its
apex
points
downwards
or
upwards
but
in
draped
curtains
all
symmetry
of
design
is
lost
and
the
rich
forms
and
fulness
of
folds
rather
tend
to
destroy
the
effect
of
elaborate
patterns
and
to
take
their
place
another
important
difference
between
standing
and
hanging
tapestries
is
their
finish
or
edge
the
upper
one
being
an
upright
continuous
border
and
the
lower
one
a
fringe
in
both
cases
it
is
a
continuation
of
the
main
threads
of
the
material
and
these
belong
exclusively
to
the
hanging
tapestries
and
curtains
the
fringe
is
so
essential
a
part
of
hanging
decoration
that
we
must
pause
and
give
it
our
best
consideration
in
babylonian
art
it
is
most
important
the
extreme
solidity
of
the
knotted
fringes
in
their
dress
and
hangings
show
either
the
thickness
of
the
woven
substance
or
that
the
fringes
were
made
by
enriching
the
warp
and
adding
to
it
they
are
almost
always
on
the
assyrian
sculptures
simply
knotted
fringes
but
the
little
portable
chaldean
temple
on
the
bronze
gates
from
balawat
near
nimroud
in
the
british
museum
shows
fringes
of
bells
or
fruit
like
those
of
the
jewish
tabernacle
in
the
wilderness
fig
on
egyptian
linen
we
sometimes
see
woven
or
worked
a
reticulated
pattern
which
imitates
a
fringe
the
carpets
of
the
egyptians
babylonians
and
persians
were
evidently
used
sometimes
as
hangings
though
many
of
their
designs
would
not
have
served
both
purposes
equally
well
that
the
babylonian
weavers
however
understood
that
a
carpet
lying
on
the
ground
should
be
covered
with
an
even
pattern
and
be
finished
with
a
border
all
round
is
evident
from
the
exquisitely
chiselled
designs
imitating
carpets
on
two
portions
of
pavements
in
the
british
museum
pl
and
we
may
compare
these
with
the
different
treatment
of
designs
for
the
veils
of
the
temples
both
in
babylon
and
egypt
on
which
were
represented
the
signs
of
the
zodiac
and
all
the
heavenly
bodies
and
other
symbolical
and
unconventional
forms
the
atrium
of
the
greek
and
pompeian
houses
which
was
modelled
on
the
same
idea
was
separated
from
the
court
by
curtains
hung
on
rods
or
nails
on
festive
occasions
these
may
have
been
garlanded
with
natural
flowers
if
so
we
may
be
sure
that
the
little
wreaths
worked
on
them
as
we
learn
from
frescoes
would
combine
with
the
gala
day
decorations
and
would
be
designed
with
that
view
the
greek
artist
would
never
have
approved
of
natural
flowers
or
trees
embroidered
as
if
growing
out
of
a
dado
simulating
a
garden
worked
in
wool
this
would
have
been
considered
a
bad
attempt
at
pictorial
art
louis
de
ronchaud
in
his
tapisseries
des
anciens
speaks
of
the
hangings
which
he
supposes
to
have
decked
the
recess
that
contained
the
chryselephantine
statue
of
athenè
parthenos
in
her
temple
at
athens
he
says
these
votive
hangings
dressed
the
pillars
that
surrounded
the
hecatompedon
and
formed
a
tent
over
the
head
of
the
goddess
de
ronchaud
believes
that
among
the
subjects
of
the
delphic
embroideries
described
by
euripides
in
the
tragedy
of
ion
may
be
recognized
some
derived
from
the
designs
on
hangings
spoken
of
by
the
poet
as
the
wings
of
the
peplos
the
downfall
of
decorative
art
domestic
as
well
as
national
kept
pace
with
the
downfall
of
the
roman
empire
during
the
dark
ages
of
such
art
there
seems
to
have
been
very
little
and
of
that
the
best
was
celtic
or
but
the
darkness
shrouds
from
our
view
the
artistic
life
of
the
world
and
the
dawn
was
very
long
in
breaking
we
must
therefore
return
to
the
subject
of
hangings
after
a
gap
of
nearly
a
thousand
years
when
the
first
stirrings
of
the
european
revival
came
in
the
twelfth
century
symonds
says
the
arts
and
the
inventions
the
knowledge
and
the
books
which
suddenly
became
vital
at
the
time
of
the
renaissance
had
long
lain
neglected
on
the
shores
of
that
dead
sea
which
we
call
middle
ages
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
during
the
dark
ages
hangings
woven
and
embroidered
continued
to
be
the
custom
throughout
europe
our
own
records
prove
that
such
furnishings
were
employed
to
mitigate
the
cold
bareness
of
our
northern
homes
from
the
earliest
times
sir
dasent
informs
me
that
in
icelandic
sagas
as
early
as
the
eleventh
century
there
are
frequent
notices
of
hangings
both
in
churches
and
in
the
halls
of
houses
such
for
instance
as
the
saga
of
charlemagne
scenes
out
of
charlemagne
life
worked
on
hangings
ells
long
in
scaldic
poetry
a
periphrasis
for
a
lady
is
the
ground
of
hangings
or
the
bridge
of
hangings
all
pointing
to
embroidery
from
illuminated
mss
engraved
in
strutt
antiquities
of
the
english
and
contemporary
european
work
of
the
tenth
to
the
thirteenth
centuries
we
find
that
the
favourite
style
of
embroidery
when
not
representing
historical
or
sacred
subjects
was
a
pattern
armorial
bearings
were
generally
reserved
for
cushions
and
the
baldachinos
of
altars
beds
and
thrones
richer
and
more
flowing
designs
were
later
introduced
in
the
fifteenth
sixteenth
and
seventeenth
centuries
splendid
tapestries
of
arras
and
hangings
even
of
cloth
of
gold
were
common
as
palatial
decorations
sometimes
we
have
a
glimpse
of
less
ambitious
hangings
for
instance
in
the
london
house
of
sir
andrew
larkynge
knight
in
the
fifteenth
century
the
hall
was
hung
with
panels
bordered
with
gold
darned
work
and
the
parler
with
bordered
with
crimson
french
embroidered
hangings
were
very
fine
in
the
sixteenth
century
jeanne
the
mother
of
henri
was
a
great
patroness
of
such
works
miss
freer
tells
us
that
when
jeanne
and
antoine
took
possession
of
the
castle
of
pau
they
found
their
new
abode
rich
in
works
of
art
and
splendid
decorations
the
refined
taste
of
marguerite
was
visible
everywhere
jeanne
was
adorned
with
hangings
of
crimson
satin
embroidered
by
the
hand
of
marguerite
herself
the
embroidery
represented
a
passage
from
the
history
of
the
queen
own
life
during
the
hours
which
the
queen
allowed
herself
for
relaxation
she
worked
tapestry
and
discoursed
with
some
one
of
the
learned
men
whom
she
protected
the
queen
daily
attended
the
afternoon
sermon
preached
by
her
chaplains
in
rotation
often
however
weary
with
the
excess
of
her
mental
labours
and
lulled
by
the
drowsy
intonation
of
some
of
these
ministers
the
queen
slept
during
part
of
the
discourse
jeanne
always
felt
severe
reproach
of
conscience
when
she
had
thus
involuntarily
yielded
to
fatigue
and
finding
the
inclination
grow
upon
her
she
demanded
permission
from
the
synod
to
work
tapestry
during
the
sermon
this
request
was
granted
and
from
thenceforth
queen
jeanne
bending
decorously
over
her
and
busy
with
her
needle
gave
due
attention
to
the
rambling
addresses
of
her
preachers

boasts
a
most
curious
suite
of
hangings
from
the
chateau
de
boussac
of
the
early
part
of
the
fifteenth
century
which
are
charming
quaint
and
gay
and
historically
and
archæologically
interesting
they
tell
the
story
of
the
dame

modern
french
tapestries
from
the
manufactories
of
the
savonnerie
the
gobelins
and
elsewhere
are
decorative
to
the
highest
degree
nothing
can
be
more
festive
than
these
works
of
the
time
of
louis
and
framed
in
white
and
gold
carved
wood
or
stucco
reflected
in
mirrors
and
lighted
by
crystal
or
glass
chandeliers
and
girandoles
such
hangings
have
nothing
in
common
with
those
of
early
times
they
are
not
temporary
coverings
of
bare
spaces
but
panels
in
decorated
walls
where
they
form
an
integral
part
of
the
architectural
composition
and
design
they
do
not
merely
serve
to
give
warmth
comfort
and
colour
to
desolate
halls
as
did
those
ancient
tapestries
belonging
to
the
furniture
of
the
great
man
who
sent
them
on
before
him
from
palace
to
palace
carrying
them
away
with
his
baggage
lest
some
one
else
should
do
so
in
his
absence
these
were
probably
merely
attached
by
loops
and
nails
as
one
sees
in
country
villas
or
castles
in
italy
to
this
day
we
find
that
the
italians
in
the
sixteenth
and
seventeenth
centuries
often
hung
their
walls
with
upright
strips
of
work
in
the
guise
of
pilasters
the
walls
were
thus
divided
into
panelled
spaces
which
separated
pictures
statues
and
cabinets
of
which
the
style
did
not
agree
in
juxtaposition
these
pilasters
were
generally
of
opus
consutum
or
appliqué
in
its
different
forms
above
next
to
the
cornice
and
below
next
to
the
dado
or
even
touching
the
floor
they
were
connected
by
borders
of
similar
work
the
spaces
between
were
mostly
filled
in
with
rich
brocades
or
velvets
of
one
colour
so
as
to
make
the
best
backgrounds
for
the
artistic
treasures
grouped
against
them
sometimes
fine
tapestries
filled
the
intervening
spaces
and
sometimes
splendid
embroideries
there
is
a
beautiful
example
of
this
sort
of
decoration
at
holland
house
where
the
is
adorned
with
pilasters
worked
on
velvet
in
gold
and
coloured
silks
with
tapestries
between
them
this
is
florentine
work
of
the
sixteenth
or
beginning
of
the
seventeenth
century
hangings
entirely
in
needlework
to
cover
large
spaces
are
rare
but
a
few
are
to
be
found
all
over
europe
in
museums
palaces
and
private
houses
which
are
interesting
as
objects
of
art
the
genealogical
tree
of
the
counts
of
kyburg
designed
in
the
sixteenth
century
and
carried
to
france
as
plunder
and
now
restored
to
its
home
near
zurich
is
a
remarkable
instance
of
a
piece
of
needlework
that
deserved
the
value
placed
on
it
many
splendid
pieces
of
embroidered
tapestries
are
at
the
cluny
museum
the
beatitudes
of
catherine
from
the
castle
at
tarrascon
and
the
hangings
worked
in
appliqué
and
flat
stitches
with
portraits
of
henri
jeanne
are
monuments
of
industry
and
design
and
are
very
beautiful
there
is
a
large
room
at
castle
ashby
hung
with
tapestry
in
cross
stitches
worked
by
the
ladies
of
the
family
and
finished
years
ago
the
industry
shown
here
is
indubitable
but
the
designs
are
barbarously
bad
and
funny
in
the
palazzo
giustini
at
florence
there
is
a
suite
of
hangings
worked
also
in
cross
stitches
of
the
same
period
of
which
the
design
is
very
clever
and
graceful
and
the
effect
beautiful
and
artistic
an
irregular
bank
of
brown
earth
is
crowded
with
grasses
and
small
flowers
about
a
foot
above
the
dado
and
from
this
grow
covered
with
blossoms
of
different
shades
held
back
to
a
treillage
of
delicate
cane
colours
the
leafage
is
brown
against
a
sky
that
is
not
blue
but
which
rather
reminds
one
of
blue
than
of
grey
it
is
conventionally
treated
and
the
effect
is
singularly
rich
and
harmonious
had
it
been
a
little
more
naturalistic
it
would
have
looked
too
much
like
a
painted
picture
but
as
it
is
the
decoration
is
charming
and
so
universally
admired
that
we
can
not
but
wonder
it
has
never
been
imitated
in
the
borghese
palace
at
rome
there
is
a
hung
with
white
satin
embroidered
with
wreaths
of
flowers
and
a
similar
one
in
the
caetani
palace
on
crimson
satin
these
are
about
years
old
and
are
so
far
above
being
mere
objects
of
fashion
that
they
must
be
placed
by
their
beauty
of
design
and
execution
amongst
objects
of
art
and
so
will
probably
survive
more
centuries
of
change
holding
their
own
and
increasing
in
value
and
esteem
for
hangings
in
church
decoration
the
reader
is
referred
to
the
chapters
on
ecclesiastical
art
and
on
tapestry
having
discussed
the
origin
and
reason
for
hangings
and
having
tried
to
draw
from
what
has
been
accepted
as
beautiful
and
perfect
in
taste
some
guidance
in
hanging
our
modern
rooms
supposing
always
that
the
spaces
are
fitted
for
really
fine
decorations
i
yet
would
add
a
few
more
words
on
this
subject
there
are
in
general
some
previous
conditions
which
will
help
us
to
choose
the
style
and
design
of
such
furnishings
in
the
first
place
we
should
study
what
is
appropriate
to
the
persons
who
will
first
inhabit
the
rooms
the
bride
apartment
may
be
white
and
gold
garlanded
with
roses
and
gay
with
groups
of
cupids
but
such
prettinesses
would
not
be
suitable
to
the
home
of
a
mourning
queen
tender
or
subdued
colouring
equally
sets
off
groups
of
young
and
lovely
faces
and
the
bent
form
robed
in
black
embroideries
are
always
agreeable
on
such
backgrounds
and
it
is
as
a
vehicle
for
needlework
that
i
now
allude
to
the
design
of
the
artist
in
hangings
we
are
somewhat
restricted
or
we
ought
to
be
when
there
are
treasures
of
art
already
in
the
house
by
the
desire
to
exhibit
them
to
the
best
advantage
the
hangings
should
be
of
a
colour
which
suits
all
pictures
and
if
the
walls
are
either
embroidered
or
tapestried
with
woven
designs
they
should
be
very
much
subdued
both
in
form
and
colour
so
as
not
to
prevent
the
eye
from
perceiving
at
once
the
precious
objects
hung
against
them
a
fine
brocade
or
velvet
of
one
colour
suits
pictures
best
but
if
our
object
is
to
show
off
our
cabinets
which
are
generally
black
and
our
statues
which
are
mostly
white
then
richly
embroidered
backgrounds
in
brilliant
colours
are
the
best
compensating
the
eye

variety

furniture
has
been
the
excuse
and
the
vehicle
for
embroideries
from
the
footstool
and
the
cushion
to
the
window
curtain
and
the
such
curtains
are
the
most
permanently
important
features
in
the
economy
or
rather
the
luxury
of
the
house
let
us
begin
with
the
decorations
of
the
state
bedroom
now
the
shape
of
the
bed
must
regulate
the
design
if
there
is
only
a
canopy
like
that
over
a
throne
one
may
have
fine
work
for
the
head
of
the
bed
inside
the
canopy
and
a
rich
border
round
its
valance
this
should
contrast
with
the
walls
and
the
curtains
should
marry
the
two
together
by
the
embroidered
borders
belonging
to
the
fashion
of
the
bed
and
accompanying
the
window
curtains
while
the
plain
surface
should
match
with
the
wall
hangings
another
method
is
to
have
the
bed
and
curtains
hung
with
plain
materials
to
contrast
with
embroidered
or
tapestried
hangings
on
the
walls
this
style
of
bed
canopy
absolutely
belongs
to
the
decoration
of
the
wall
to
which
it
is
attached
but
when
we
have
to
deal
with
a
large
bed
a
room
within
a
room
as
poor
prince
lee
boo
said
the
bed
may
in
its
own
decoration
be
totally
independent
of
the
wall
hangings
and
care
must
be
taken
that
we
do
not
injure
the
effect
of
both
by
too
much
contrast
or
too
much
similarity
every
room
has
its
own
individuality
and
the
first
beginning
of
its
decoration
must
be
the
to
guide
the
rest
of
the
furnishing
and
adornment
i
am
anxious
to
point
out
that
the
bed
and
its
belongings
are
a
most
important
element
in
the
beauty
and
dignity
of
style
of
the
room
and
the
house
that
contains
it
it
is
a
splendid
opportunity
for
displaying
the
embroideries
of
the
women
of
the
family
and
for
exercising
their
taste
the
chamber
of
dais
as
it
was
called
in
old
times
was
always
carefully
adorned
for
the
welcome
of
the
honoured
guest
the
and
even
the
linen
were
embroidered
and
the
greatest
care
and
the
most
artistic
work
were
lavished
on
the
coverlet
in
firm
stitches
and
twisted
threads
while
on
the
curtains
the
frailest
materials
and
most
delicate
stitches
were
freely
bestowed
as
they
were
safe
from
friction
we
may
employ
and
for
such
works
with
safety
as
a
rule
we
should
avoid
too
great
a
variety
of
design
in
the
decoration
of
a
bedroom
and
at
the
same
time
beware
of
its
becoming
monotonous
i
should
say
that
a
change
in
the
design
though
not
in
the
style
of
the
different
parts
of
the
bed
is
admissible
and
gives
opportunities
for
rich
and
graceful
work
for
instance
a
parsemé
pattern
may
be
varied
judiciously
on
the
curtains
the
valance
and
the
heading
provided
there
is
a
connecting
link
say
a
cypher
found
throughout
if
the
back
of
the
baldachino
is
embroidered
it
admits
of
totally
different
treatment
and
the
valance
must
include
a
border
according
to
its
outline
the
ingenuity
and
magnificence
of
the
elizabethan
bedroom
furnishings
are
proved
by
the
inventories
to
be
found
in
old
houses
those
describing
the
property
of
the
earl
of
leicester
in
the
library
at
longleat
are
so
characteristic
of
a
time
when
each
room
contained
artistic
furniture
that
i
can
not
help
making
here
some
extracts
and
pointing
out
that
embroidery
was
usually
employed
to
individualize
each
decoration

a

and

crimson
velvet
embroidered
with
silver
roses
and
lined
throughout
with
buckram
there
was
apparently
a
second
set
of
curtains
inside
of
striped
white
satin
trimmed
and
fringed
with
silver
and
the
velvet
curtains
were
also
fringed
with
silver
with
long
buttons
and
loops
another
bedstead
is
described

the
pillars

the
catalogue
of
the
tapestries
and
embroidered
hangings
include
fifteen
suites
at
kenilworth
only
and
three
other
houses
are
equally
well
provided
the
ground
of
one
of
these
suites
of
five
pieces
of
embroidery
of
animals
and
flowers
is
described
as
being
stannel
cloth
lined
with
cannevois
canvas
each
room
has
chairs
cushions
carpets
which
appear
to
have
covered
the
floor
and
the
tables
and
cabinutts
cabinets
covered
with
embroideries
in
a
florentine
palace
the
alessandri
there
is
a
state
apartment
where
the
bed
the
walls
the
curtains
and
the
furniture
are
entirely
decorated
with
the
same
splendid
materials
gold
brocaded
with
crimson
velvet
the
eye
longs
for
some
repose
amidst
the
gorgeous
reiterated
forms
and
colours
if
the
bed
and
curtains
had
been
either
plain
crimson
velvet
or
embroidery
it
would
have
been
much
more
beautiful
this
sort
of
example
is
a
lesson
and
a
warning
which
is
valuable
even
under
less
splendid
conditions
amongst
our
fine
indian
embroideries
those
of
lucknow
gulbargah
aurungabad
and
hyderabad
are
well
fitted
for
beds
and
furniture
these
we
can
study
in
the
indian
museum
and
it
seems
a
pity
not
to
profit
by
and
encourage
the
resources
of
our
own
empire
carpets
and
rugs
were
sometimes
embroidered
as
well
as
woven
in
patterns
they
were
anciently
spread
on
thrones
couches
and
sofas
at
entertainments
and
used
for
covering
the
catafalques
at
funeral
ceremonies
or
for
laying
over
tombs
as
is
still
the
custom
in
the
east
we
who
restrict
their
use
to
domestic
purposes
are
beginning
to
understand
that
these
decorations
look
best
when
the
patterns
are
geometrical
and
that
natural
objects
such
as
rabbits
and
roses
even
when
conventionalized
are
unpleasant
to
tread
upon
the
sofa
and
chairs
are
so
often
the
vehicles
for
embroidery
that
we
must
give
them
a
separate
share
of
our
attention
the
square
shapes
of
the
repeated
several
times
give
us
an
opportunity
for
balancing
colours
and
introducing
forms
of
decoration
which
may
be
made
to
contrast
with
everything
else
in
the
room
and
so
enhance
the
general
effect
say
that
the
carpet
is
red
and
the
furniture
and
hangings
are
of
tender
broken
tints
it
will
be
a
pleasure
to
the
eye
if
the
cushions
on
the
sofa
and
the
chairs
and
seats
are
panelled
with
a
deeper
or
lighter
colour
than
the
carpet
but
always
reposing
the
eye
by
contrasting
plain
surfaces
with
richness
of
design
then
the
footstool
or
cushion
should
break
away
entirely
from
the
carpet
on
which
it
lies
that
the
poor
thing
may
be
spared
the
kick
it
invariably
receives
when
the
master
of
the
house
has
tripped
over
its
invisible
presence
for
furniture
the
cushion
stitches
canvas
and
cross
stitches
are
certainly
the
best
they
are
the
most
enduring
as
they
bear
friction
without
fraying
and
are
therefore
in
this
case
preferable
to
satin
stitches
which
are
liable
to
be
spoilt
by
contact
and
give
the
lady
of
the
house
who
is
probably
the
artist
a
pang
each
time
an
honoured
guest
occupies
the
comfortable
chair
embroidered
in
floss
silk
unaware
that
it
is
an
æsthetic
investment
and
that
a
percentage
of
its
beauty
is
disappearing
every
time
it
is
brought
into
collision
with
broadcloth
this
brings
us
to
the
subject
of
the
covers
called
housses
by
french
upholsterers
and
which
may
come
under
the
head
of
small
decorations
or
rather
of
petty
disfigurements
the
things
which
went
by
the
horrid
name
of
antimacassars
have
however
given
way
to
and
crochet
has
been
displaced
by
linen
veils
worked
in
crewels
this
is
a
step
in
the
right
direction
no
eye
could
do
otherwise
than
suffer
from
the
glaring
white
patterns
of
mounted
aggressively
on
the
back
of
every
chair
in
the
room
as
a
buffer
between
it
and
the
human
head
and
shoulders
the
suggestion
was
disagreeable
and
the
present
still
recalls
it
to
reconcile
us
to
its
use
it
must
be
sparingly
used
and
artistically
disposed
the
antimacassar
is
a
remaining
sign
of
the
overlap
of
dress
and
manners
our
embroidered
the
chairs
and
valued
them
exceedingly
and
never
would
have
contemplated
that
they
should
be
soiled
by
a
male
or
female
head
lying
back
upon
them
true
they
wore
powder
and
pomatum
then
but
they
never
leant
back
such
a
solace
and
solecism
in
manners
was
reserved
for
the
privacy
of
the
bedroom
and
the
covered
with
cotton
piqué
or
washing
chintz
under
the
new
manners
and
since
the
introduction
of
the
graceful
lounge
the
antimacassar
doubtless
has
saved
many
ancestral
works
but
nowadays
we
wear
neither
powder
nor
pomatum
on
the
contrary
we
dye
dry
and
frizzle
our
hair
till
it
might
serve
as
a
brush
to
remove
any
dust
it
encountered
and
it
spoils
nothing
the
is
a
source
of
endless
variety
on
the
whole
i
should
recommend
here
plain
surfaces
and
deep
borders
the
articles
thrown
on
the
table
are
best
set
off
by
plain
grounds
the
colour
of
the
may
be
a
test
of
artistic
taste
and
may
make
or
mar
the
whole
effect
of
the
furnishings
of
the
room
especially
if
it
is
newly
acquired
in
order
to
enliven
the
fading
glories
of
ancestral
taste
the
this
evidently
began
its
existence
as
a
curtain
hung
on
a
movable
frame
for
the
purpose
of
dividing
large
chambers
for
separate
uses
the
chinese
seem
to
have
been
the
first
to
stretch
the
curtain
tight
over
the
frame
making
it
a
fixture
and
often
an
actual
partition
painted
with
pictures
by
brush
or
needle
to
our
modern
home
the
screen
in
a
large
room
gives
a
sense
of
snugness
and
is
an
actual
necessity
for
keeping
off
the
draughts
drifting
in
through
and
doors
and
at
the
same
time
serving
æsthetically
as
a
background
to
high
chairs
and
tables
heaped
with
objects
of
art
and
tall
vases
of
flowers
the
high
screen
groups
and
unites
the
pictures
of
active
and
still
life
around
it
and
meanwhile
the
little
are
performing
the
merciful
service
of
saving
the
complexions
of
our
daughters
from
being
sacrificed
to
moloch
in
front
of
our
scorching
coal
fires
i
need
not
recommend
these
as
fit
surfaces
for
embroidery
they
offer
themselves
to
it
and
the
school
of
art
needlework
is
a
living
witness
to
how
much
they
are
appreciated
and
how
largely
employed
on
the
screen
decorative
ambition
is
permitted
to
rise
to
pictorial
art
nothing
in
furniture
is
prettier
than
the
screen
covered
with
refined
needle
painting
either
arabesqued
or
naturalistic
you
may
vary
the
designs
to
any
extent
either
as
large
pictures
covering
many
folds
or
in
small
pictures
repeated
or
varied
on
each
here
design
to
individualize
the
comes
into
play
and
is
most
conspicuous
for
good
or
for
evil
effect
amongst
the
occasional
furnishings
of
the
home
we
would
instance
embroidered
curtains
to
veil
pictures
which
are
perhaps
too
sacred
to
expose
to
the
general
eye
we
know
how
often
in
churches
and
sacristies
on
the
continent
one
or
even

i
would
recommend
this
style
of
work
to
the
consideration
of
our
decorators
it
is
interesting
to
find
in
an
old
catalogue
at
hampton
court
how
pictures
of
sacred
subjects
were
thus
decently
veiled
in
the
profaner
moments
of
court
gaieties
embroidered
book
coverings
were
often
very
beautiful
either
as
simply
clothing
the
boards
or
when
finished
with
corners
backs
and
clasps

the
following
lines
said
to
have
been
written

tact
discretion
and
knowledge
are
required
when
we
undertake
to
adorn
the
home
to
be
lived
in
and
while
employing
the
art
of
embroidery
to
embellish
it
we
must
never
forget
that
harmony
and
the
absence
of
anything
startling
tends
to
the
grandiose
as
well
as
the
comfortable
bright
bits
of
colouring
should
be
reserved
for
pictorial
art
or
for
small
objects
such
as
cushions
and
stools
if
for
the
general
tint
blue
be
chosen
let
it
be
either
pure
pale
colour
like
the
æther
or
a
soft
one
pale
or
dark
such
as
indigo
but
the
startling
aniline
blues
should
be
avoided
as
being
offensive
to
the
nerves
of
the
eye
if
red
be
the
foundation
colour
let
it
be
venetian
red
part
scarlet
part
crimson
or
pure
crimson
tyrian
purple
or
pure
scarlet
cochineal
never
employ
scarlet
with
a
yellow
tinge
it
may
not
affect
yourself
but
it
is
blinding
to
many
eyes
avoid
brickdust
which
is
simply
a
dirty
mixture
of
earthy
colours
of
green
there
are
few
shades
that
are
not
beautiful
soothing
and
more
or
less
fitted
for
a
background
to
needlework
and
nature
teaches
us
how
these
harmonize
together
and
with
all
other
colours
only
arsenical
green
is
impracticable
and
repulsive
yellow
pale
as
a
primrose
glowing
as
gold
or
tender
as
butter
is
always
beautiful
but
one
tint
we
would
exclude
from
our
list
called
buff
which
never
can
assimilate
with
any
other
colour
and
is
often
the
refuge
of
the
man
that
can
not
face
the
responsibility
of
choosing
an
atmosphere
in
which
he
will
have
to
spend
many
hours
of
his
existence
when
the
walls
the
ceiling
and
the
hangings
will
inevitably
obtain
a
subtle
but
real
influence
on
his
nerves
which
in
the
case
of
buff
will
be
that
of
a
yellow
fog
while
pale
primrose
will
have
the
effect
of
early
sunrise
and
pure
gold
that
of
sunset
a
rule
to
be
respected
is
that
decoration
should
be
reposing
instead
of
exciting
the
unexpected
which
is
an
element
in
the
enjoyment
of
what
is
new
should
be
such
as
to
become
the
more
agreeable
the
longer
we
are
accustomed
to
it
morris
golden
rule
is
this
have
nothing
in
your
houses
that
you
do
not
know
to
be
useful
or
believe
to
be
beautiful
in
decorative
art
and
therefore
in
embroidery
the
first
object
to
consider
is
beauty
beauty
in
conception
proportion
drawing
and
colour
i
would
not
have
it
thought
that
i
am
placing
our
secondary
art
too
high
and
giving
it
too
much
importance
when
i
apply
to
it
the
first
essential
rules
of
art
but
one
of
these
furnishes
my
excuse
it
is
that
the
simplest
and
smallest
creation
should
be
as
faultless
as
the
greatest
and
grandest
now
beauty
can
not
be
obtained
even
in
little
works
without
proportion
in
size
harmony
and
balance
in
colour
and
correctness
in
form
and
these
require
the
careful
study
of
first
principles
proportion
in
size
is
most
important
both
as
regards
ourselves
and
our
surroundings
objectively
and
subjectively
when
our
masters
the
greeks
wished
to
express
force
and
majesty
they
sculptured
their
gods
of
unearthly
size
larger
than
their
heroes
who
yet
exceeded
in
stature
their
human
models
the
statue
of
the
god
placed
in
the
temple
was
the
largest
object
seen
and
the
delicacy
and
refinement
of
the
details
in
dress
throne
and
base
only
enhanced
the
effect
of
majestic
proportion
in
the
temple
men
were
to
be
reminded
of
their
own
nothingness
in
the
gymnasium
and
on
the
racecourse
and
at
the
public
games
the
surrounding
pictures
and
statues
were
all
intended
to
excite
ambition
by
showing
men
the
heroic
size
to
be
attained
by
the
awards
of
fame
but
at
home
in
the
house
man
is
already
supreme
and
needs
no
incentive
to
assert
himself
and
no
tall
standard
by
which
he
may
be
measured
the
lares
and
penates
themselves
were
very
small
objects
to
look
at
whatever
may
have
been
the
thoughts
they
suggested
nothing
is
so
alarming
or
unpleasant
as
gigantic
figures
worked
in
tapestry
or
embroidery
and
if
even
the
guardian
gods
of
the
house
were
kept
in
due
subjection
as
to
size
why
not
all
decorations
and
especially
those
representing
the
flowers
of
the
field
certainly
in
worked
decorations
flowers
should
be
no
larger
than
in
nature
perhaps
on
the
whole
they
are
best
rather
smaller
botanical
monstrosities
on
the
wall
dwarf
the
flowers
in
a
near
them
and
nature
has
her
own
lovely
proportions
which
should
be
studied
and
respected
these
remarks
of
course
apply
exclusively
to
domestic
decoration
which
is
the
special
object
of
our
art
and
for
the
guidance
of
which
the
suggestions
contained
in
this
chapter
are
intended
i
would
strongly
advocate
the
return
to
the
old
system
for
the
production
of
large
embroideries
if
ladies
would
design
or
have
designed
for
them
curtains
or
tapestries
and
let
the
be
the
permanent
occupier
of
the
morning
they
might
at
least
commence
works
that
members
of
the
family
or
friends
might
continue
and
complete
at
their
leisure
and
should
they
at
any
time
hang
fire
a
needlewoman
or
clever
professional
worker
might
be
called
in
to
help
to
finish
it
thus
ladies
might
assist
the
art
of
needlework
by
their
own
original
ideas
and
give
individual
beauty
to
their
homes
and
an
impetus
to
the
occupation
which
helps
to
support
so
many
of
our
struggling
sisters
the
frame
or
métier
is
always
a
pretty
object
in
the
or
boudoir
the
french
understand
this
well
and
make
it
one
of
their
most
useful
properties
in
their
scenic
representations
of
refined
home
life
i
will
conclude
this
chapter
with
two
quotations
the
first
is
part
of
sir
digby
wyatt
advice
in
a
cambridge
lecture
you
can
never
hope
he
says
to
have
the
means
of
supplying
yourself
with
what
is
beautiful
unless
you
take
pains
to
add
to
the
production
of
that
beauty
the
colour
which
the
decorative
painter
and
the
embroiderer
also
may
cast
around
you
is
neither
more
nor
less
than
an
atmosphere
in
which
your
eye
will
be
either
strengthened
or
debilitated
if
you
accustom
your
eye
only
or
mainly
to
contemplate
what
is
satisfactory
in
colour
and
form
to
the
highest
tastes
it
will
gradually
become
allured
to
such
delicacy
of
organization
as
to
reject
unintentionally
all
that
is
repugnant
to
perfect
taste

with

its

has
done
for
him
no
more
than
that
you
can
not
civilize
man
unless
you
give
him
a
share
in
art
but
the
man
must
be
civilized
by
education
to
accept
that
share
of
art
that
his
life
offers
to
him
it
must
be
admitted
that
though
a
man
may
be
educated
enough
to
enable
him
to
theorize
he
may
yet
be
too
poor
to
furnish
with
taste
if
he
is
able
to
act
up
to
his
theories
and
to
surround
himself
with
what
is
refined
and
fail
to
do
so
and
is
contented
not
to
stir
in
this
matter
he
is
not
truly
educated
now
that

semper
labarte
and
sir
digby
wyatt
all
take
it
for
granted
that
the
art
of
dress
preceded
all
other
arts
every
ancient
record
shows
how
early
decoration
of
dress
by
needlework
began
and
how
far
it
had
gone
and
when
we
read
of
festal
hospitalities
and

embroidered

invariably
named
solomon

pl
italian
knight
dressed
for

by

fabriano
academia
at
florence
as
soon
as
dress
became
an
art
and
not
merely
an
acknowledged
necessity
for
warmth
and
decency
i
see
no
reason
to
deny
that
the
same
decorative
genius
that
embroidered
the
garment
might
at
the
same
time
have
imagined
the
carving
of
the
chair
and
the
inlaying
of
the
sword
and
bow
but
as
regards
the
precedence
of
the
arts
we
can
only
guess
at
what
is
probable
beauty
in
dress
is
certainly
a
universal
instinctive
passion
perhaps
the
birds
which
darwin
and
others
credit
with
preening
their
plumage
conscious
that
their
spots
are
the
brightest
and
their
feathers
the
glossiest
and
that
they
are
therefore
adored
by
the
hens
and
the
envy
of
the
shabbier
cocks
suggested
to
men
the
same
method
for
securing
the
preference
of
the
other
sex
who
in
return
willingly
helped
to
adorn
the
idols
of
their
hearts
and
homes
plate
this
natural
state
of
things
still
prevails
in
central
africa
where
schweinfürth
describes
a
king
dancing
before
his
wives
costumed
in
the
tails
of
lions
and
peacocks
and
crowned
with
the
proboscis
of
an
elephant
it
appears
however
that
unlike
cleopatra
custom
had
staled
his
infinite
variety
and
the
ladies
looked
on
the
splendid
display
with
blank
indifference
this
is
only
a
barbarous
illustration
of
the
fact
that
in
the
earliest
civilizations
magnificent
garments
were
worn
by
men
to
dazzle
and
awe
the
beholders
by
the
splendour
which
represented
wealth
and
conquest
how
glorious
a
man
could
appear
apparelled
to
represent
majesty
and
dominion
may
be
learned
by
studying
canon
rock
book
on
the
coronation
dresses
of
the
emperors
of
germany
a
book
great
in
every
sense
of
the
word
the
portrait
of
charles
robed
and
crowned
is
a
dazzling
example
of
the
arts
of
dress
embroidery
and
work
these
garments
have
for
ages
been
treasured
at
vienna
and
in
the
vatican
at
rome
the
coronation
garments
of
the
emperors
of
russia
are
said
to
be
gorgeously
beautiful
it
seems
hardly
necessary
to
assert
that
embroidery
has
always
been
especially
applicable
to
dress
each
garment
being
individualized
by
the
design
depicted
on
it
was
fitted
for
individual
uses
and
occasions
the
conqueror
palmated
mantle
the
coronation
robe
the
bridal
garment
the
costume
of
the
peasant
for
festival
days
and
the
officiating
vestments
of
the
priests
for
special
services
of
prayer
and
praise
these
were
loyally
or
piously
worked
they
descended
from
generation
to
generation
as
family
treasures
or
as
historical
memorials
and
sometimes
as
holy
relics
till
they
and
the
call
for
them
were
swept
away
at
once
by
social
changes
yet
some
still
remain
and
hold
their
place
priestly
garments
together
with
church
decorations
never
laid
aside
in
the
roman
and
greek
churches
are
being
partially
revived
in
our
own
and
for
secular
adornment
the
embroiderer
is
often
called
upon
to
work
a
garland
to
enwreathe
the
form
of
a
pretty
woman
to
lie
on
her
shoulders
and
encircle
her
waist
the
greatest
loss
to
the
art
is
that
men
as
a
rule
have
ceased
to
individualize
themselves
or
their
position
or
office
by
dress
and
have
left
entirely
to
the
women
the
pleasure
and
duty
of
making
themselves
as
lovely
and
conspicuous
as
their
circumstances
will
permit
the
same
linen
and
broadcloth
are
cut
in
the
same
shapes
of
which
the
only
merit
is
that
they
are
said
to
be
comfortable
and
whose
highest
aim
is
to
be
spotless
and
unwrinkled
these
show
the
altered
conditions
of
the
highly
civilized
man
and
woman
too
for
he
has
long
left
behind
him
the
idea
of
dazzling
the
female
eye
or
heart
by
the
attraction
of
colour
this
applies
only
to
european
costume
at
home
or
in
the
colonies
the
east
still
retains
its
pleasure
in
gorgeous
combinations
in
which
man
enfolds
his
person
and
shows
how
beautiful
he
can
make
himself
when
thus
clothed
in
accordance
with
the
classical
axioms
as
to
how
much
of
the
human
form
should
be
revealed
and
how
much
concealed
the
principle
on
which
the
ancients
embroidered
their
garments
was
like
that
of
the
indians
the
large
surfaces
plain
or
covered
with
quiet
diapers
or
spots
the
rich
ornaments
being
reserved
for
the
borders
the
girdles
and
the
scarves
their
garments
hung
loose
from
the
shoulders
or
girdle
whether
long
or
short
they
clung
to
the
figure
or
fluttered
in
the
wind
the
long
flowing
robes
to
the
feet
veiled
the
form
completely
and
were
only
thrown
off
for
the
battle
or
the
chase
or
in
the
struggles
for
victory
in
the
races
and
games
dress
in
the
supreme
reign
of
beauty
was
intended
to
flow
around
or
to
conceal
but
never
to
the
human
frame
it
enclosed

the
greeks
certainly
wore
delicate
and
tasteful
embroidery
on
their
garments
frequently
finished
with
splendid
borders
while
the
large
space
between
was
dotted
with
stars
or
some
simple
pattern
we
learn
this
from
the
paintings
on
greek
fictile
vases
in
the
british
museum
there
is
a
little
bronze
statuette
of
minerva
with
twinkling
diamond
eyes
she
has
a
broad
band
of
embroidered
silver
foliage
from
her
throat
to
her
feet
as
the
beauty
of
greek
forms
acted
and
reacted
on
the
beauty
of
their
art
of
dress
so
we
may
be
certain
that
all
deformity
of
dress
has
been
produced
by
deformity
of
race
in
mind
or
body
and
that
climate
is
an
important
factor
in
both
the
cold
of
the
farthest
north
has
produced
people
short
fat
and
hairy
which
natural
gifts
have
been
supplemented
by
their
warm
clothes
or
coverings
in
the
same
way
that
a
cosy
covers
a
teapot
flowing
garments
there
would
be
utterly
out
of
place
petticoats
are
unknown
and
the
lapp
hangs
out
nothing
that
can
be
the
vehicle
for
carrying
an
icicle
their
dresses
or
cases
are
planned
to
keep
out
the
cold
and
to
place
another
atmosphere
between
the
heart
of
the
breathing
mass
and
the
cruel
cutting
outer
wind
hence
the
materials
used
are
not
only
woven
hair
but
the
furry
skins
themselves
in
the
south
under
the
sunshine
dress
is
for
the
greater
part
of
the
year
only
needed
for
decency
and
beauty
the
flowing
and
delicate
cottons
and
silks
and
fine
woollens
are
shaped
to
cover
and
adorn
the
beautiful
forms
which
for
entire
isolation
take
refuge
in
the
mantle
the
mantle
was
the
great
opportunity
for
the
embroiderer
craft
alkisthenes
the
sybarite
had
a
garment
of
such
magnificence
that
when
it
was
exhibited
in
the
temple
of
juno
at
lacinium
where
all
italy
was
congregated
it
attracted
such
universal
admiration
that
it
was
sold
to
the
carthaginians
by
dionysius
the
elder
for
talents
the
ground
was
purple
wrought
all
over
with
animals
except
the
centre
where
were
seen
jupiter
juno
apollo
minerva
venus
and
themis
on
one
border
was
the
figure
of
alkisthenes
himself
on
the
other
was
depicted
the
emblematic
figure
of
his
native
city
sybaris
the
size
of
the
garment
was
homeric
it
was
fifteen
cubits
or
feet
in
breadth
that
the
ladies
of
greece
in
the
fourth
century
carried
down
the
historical
and
homeric
traditions
of
the
embroidery
frame
and
made
it
part
of
their
daily
lives
while
the
persian
women
of
rank
left
such
work
to
their
slaves
is
evident
from
the
pretty
legend
told
of
alexander
the
great
who
desiring
to
beguile
the
weariness
of
his
prisoners
the
wife
and
family
of
darius
sent
them
some
of
his
garments
to
embroider
when
it
was
reported
to
him
that
these
princesses
were
much
mortified
believing
it
was
a
suggestion
of
their
fallen
fortunes
alexander
hastened
to
reassure
them
saying
that
his
own
mother
and
sisters
occupied
themselves
in
embroidering
dresses
the
persians
and
babylonians
seem
to
have
preferred
subjects
for
their
embroidered
dresses
somewhat
in
the
style
of
the
mantle
of
alkisthenes
which
was
probably
oriental
and
suggests
the
babylonian
mantle
in
jericho
which
tempted
achan
to
sin
the
egyptian
frescoes
on
the
other
hand
sometimes
give
us
women
and
goddesses
dressed
in
small
flowery
patterns
that
remind
one
of
indian
chintzes
these
were
probably
woven
painted
and
embroidered
and
filled
in
with
threads
of
gold
the
romans
varied
their
fashions
but
they
preferred
for
a
time
striped
borders
on
their
garments
and
called
them
molores
dilores
trilores
up
to
seven
the
greeks
but
seldom
departed
from
the
rule
of
plain
or
quietly
patterned
surfaces
with
rich
borders
in
their
delineations
of
dress
though
there
are
examples
of
large
designs
covering
the
whole
garment
the
embroidered
dresses
of
early
christian
times
are
to
be
judged
of
by
mosaics
and
frescoes
mostly
italian
those
of
the
dark
ages
were
till
lately
only
names
and
guesses
but
a
hiatus
in
our
knowledge
has
been
filled
up
lately
by
the
store
of
entombed
textiles
discovered
in
the
fayoum
in
egypt
and
now
at
vienna
in
herr
collection
here
we
have
a
variety
of
shapes
designs
and
stitches
and
every
kind
of
subject
sacred
and
profane
christian
and
pagan
and
the
missing
links
between
indian
and
byzantine
fabrics
are
revealed
they
cover
nearly
years
from
the
third
to
the
seventh
century
and
many
of
them
may
be
looked
upon
as
apart
from
any
ecclesiastical
or
even
christian
suggestions
i
have
spoken
of
them
in
the
chapter
on
woollen
materials
after
the
seventh
century
we
again
come
into
the
dawning
light
of
history
and
find
here
and
there
an
illustrative
fragment
nearly
always
ecclesiastical
taken
from
the
graves
of
priests
and
monarchs
charlemagne
mantle
and
robe
embroidered
with
elephants
and
with

preserved
at
his
dalmatic
in
the
vatican
the
durham
embroideries
are
rare
and
precious
examples
of
that
early
period
semper
describes
the
difference
between
the
covering
and
the
binding
this
seems
to
be
little
considered
in
modern
costume
but
it
is
so
essential
that
i
would
impress
it
on
my
readers
he
says
that
the
covering
seeks
to
isolate
to
enclose
to
shelter
to
spread
around
over
a
certain
space
and
is
a
collective
unit
whereas
binding
implies
ligature
and
represents
a
united
plurality
for
example
a
bundle
of
sticks
the
of
the
lictors
binding
is
linear
in
dress
it
is
either
horizontal
or
spiral
what
can
the
united
plurality
be
that
justifies
the
binding
often
bestowed
on
the
figure
in
fashionable
costumes
more
fitted
for
binding
together
the
bones
of
the
dead
than
for
permitting
the
agility
of
the
muscles
of
the
living
semper
continues
anything
that
goes
against
this
important
axiom
is
wrong
i
think
we
must
all
agree
that
the
objects
of
dress
are
decency
isolation
warmth
grace
and
beauty
as
long
as
fashion
takes
the
place
of
taste
and
extravagant
supersedes
grace
and
beauty
we
must
not
hope
that
fine
designs
to
individualize
dress
will
be
called
for
the
french
embroideries
are
so
beautiful
and
comparatively
cheap
that
we
can
not
compete
with
them
the
best
artists
design
them
and
the
only
fault
to
be
found
is
this
that
as
they
are
made
by
thousands
of
yards
and
can
only
be
varied
by
interchange
of
colours
they
become
common
the
day
they
are
produced
it
has
been
said
that
fashion
is
made
for
a
class
but
taste
for
mankind
fashion
is
the
enemy
of
taste
though
she
makes
use
of
her
services
the
gown
of
which
the
fashion
is
in
every
sense
imported
from
france
will
probably
never
again
be
the
vehicle
for
home
embroideries
but
there
are
other
articles
of
personal
adornment
which
will
always
be
available
for
the
fancies
of
decorative
taste
the
fan
the
purse
or
satchel
the
apron
the
fichu
the
point
of
the
shoe
and
the
muff
all
these
are
objects
on
which
thought
and
ingenuity
may
well
be
expended
and
which
will
remain
as
records
of
personal
feeling
when
the
workers
and
givers
of
such
graceful
mementoes
are
far
away
and
and
embroidered
and
must
be
placed
somewhere
between
furniture
and
personal
ornament
in
all
these
the
or
unexpected
is
what
is
valuable
including
all
that
is
original
and
quaint
embroidery
will
however
probably
continue
occasionally
to
be
employed
in
the
adornment
of
dress
and
will
leave
of
each
phase
and
period
of
art
some
fine
examples
on
which
the
archæologist
of
the
future
may
pause
and
reason

are
in
most
old
houses
some
specimens
of
old
secular
work

earlier

the
date

our
artistic
tastes

power

christian

the

in
early

and
illuminated
and
the
first
specimens
that
have
come
down
to
us
of
needlework
and
textiles
testify
by
their
to
their
date
the
prosperity
of
the
church
hierarchy
was
founded
on
the
ruins
of
the
empire
over
which
attila
had
boasted
that
where
his
horse
trod
no
grass
grew
and
truly
the
cultivated
art
of
those
splendid
days
had
lapsed
at
once
to
a
poverty
of
design
and
barrenness
of
ideas
which
would
soon
have
dwindled
into
mere
primitive
forms
had
not
a
fresh
oriental
impulse
arrived
from
syria
egypt
and
byzantium
and
then
the
arts
were
born
anew
the
continuity
was
broken
yet
being
devoted
to
the
service
of
the
church
the
new
arts
were
by
it
moulded
and
fostered
little
lamps

here
and
there
in
monastic
houses
hangings

the

coverings
for
the

robes
for
the

occupied
the
artist
and
the
embroiderer
the
forms
the
colours
the
uses
were
adapting
themselves
to
become
the
symbols
of
orthodoxies
and
heresies
and
thus
became
a
part
of
the
history
of
the
church
the
links
are
many
between
them
and
the
history
of
the
state
and
here
ecclesiastical
embroideries
come
in
as
landmarks
royal
and
princely
garments
which
had
served
for
state
occasions
were
constantly
dedicated
as
votive
offerings
and
converted
into
vestments
for
the
officiating
priest
and
so
were
recorded
and
preserved
royal
and
noble
ladies
employed
their
leisure
hours
in
work
for
the
adornment
of
the
minster
or
the
home
church
or
chapel
gifts
of
the
best
were
exchanged
between
convents
or
forwarded
to
the
holy
father
at
rome
and
were
often
enriched
with
jewels
the
images
of
the
virgin
and
saints
received
from
wealthy
penitents
many
costly
garments
besides
money
and
lands
this
dedicatory
needlework
has
preserved
to
us
the
records
of
classical
byzantine
and
design
which
otherwise
must
have
been
lost
the
church
records
and
illuminated
mss
give
us
most
trustworthy
information
of
the
way
in
which
the
altars
the
priests
and
even
the
kings
were
arrayed
and
the
catalogues
of
royal
wardrobes
are
also
very
instructive
as
we
find
how
often
princely
gauds
became
as
gifts
to
the
church
commemorative
of
historical
events
such
as
a
victory
or
an
accession
a
marriage
or
a
coronation
woltmann
and
woermann
say
that
the
efforts
of
the
christians
in
the
time
of
constantine
tended
to
delay
the
extinction
of
classical
design
in
rome
of
the
fourth
century
they
give
as
examples
the
mosaics
of
pudenziana
where
we
can
still
find
antique
beauty
of
design
we
may
also
mention
the
church
of
agnese
fuori
le
mura
which
once
contained
the
sarcophagi
of
constantine
and
his
mother
helena
and
of
which
the
decorations
in
the
ceilings
are
entirely
classical
though
the
motives
had
been
transferred
to
christian
symbolism
the
total
disappearance
of
greek
art
did
not
occur
till
the
eighth
century
when
the
new
blood
infused
from
foreign
sources
began
to
assert
itself
rome
had
succeeded
to
greece
as
being
the
centre
of
christian
art
which
assumed
the
phase
commonly
called
the
romanesque
this
was
a
conglomerate
of
oriental
byzantine
and
varied
in
different
countries
then
there
were
the
scandinavian
and
runic
and
celtic
styles
drifting
from
the
north
the
lombardic
of
central
italy
the
of
ravenna
the
byzantine
of
venice
all
acting
and
reacting
upon
each
other
all
these
rough
and
inchoate
attempts
at
the
beautiful
prepared
the
world
for
the
acceptance
of
the
arabic
influence
which
is
said
to
have
been
imported
at
the
end
of
the
eleventh
century
by
the
crusaders
to
whose
pious
enterprise
some
attribute
the
whole
of
the
splendid
gothic
art
of
the
three
succeeding
centuries
but
the
marking
characteristic
of
the
arabic
arch
is
wanting
the
ogee
shape
is
seldom
to
be
found
in
christian
architecture
and
the
pointed
arch
so
naturally
results
from
the
intersection
of
the
round
arches
that
we
can
not
but
look
upon
these
causes
as
i
have
elsewhere
remarked
how
often
in
art
different
causes
to
form
a
style
the
father
and
mother
are
of
different
nationalities
and
the
result
shows
the
characteristics
of
its
double
parentage
the
learned
antiquaries
who
draw
their
arguments
mainly
from
the
form
of
the
arch
must
settle
whence
and
how
gothic
art
in
stone
came
into
europe
it
was
doubtless
the
effect
or
result
of
more
than
one
cause
but
in
as
far
as
it
influenced
textile
art
we
have
come
to
the
period
when
it
must
be
studied
in
sicily
the
house
and
of
the
crusaders
on
their
highroad
to
the
holy
land
sicily
which
had
succeeded
to
constantinople
as
being
the
great
manufacturing
mart
during
the
middle
ages
was
in
the
hands
of
the
moors
the
origin
and
source
of
all
european
gothic
textile
art
yet
even
at
palermo
and
messina
they
were
controlled
by
the
traditions
of
the
schools
of
greece
ancient
and
modern
and
by
babylonian
indian
and
african
forms
and
symbolisms
byzantium
furnished
many
of
their
designs
which
were
sometimes
of
very
remote
date
though
pressed
into
the
service
of
the
new
style
and
the
church
these
and
all
the
streams
of
ecclesiastical
decoration
throughout
europe
flowed
towards
rome
and
were
with
the
fiat
and
seal
of
the
central
church
which
also
afterwards
presided
over
the
art
of
the
renaissance
by
studying
what
remains
to
us
of
fragments
and
records
we
know
all
the
materials
which
clothed
the
primitive
and
mediæval
church
and
we
find
that
there
was
but
little
originality
in
textile
decoration
or
in
the
forms
of
dress
which
either
resembled
those
of
the
priests
in
the
jewish
synagogue
or
those
of
the
heathen
temples
and
were
adapted
from
traditional
patterns
the
constant
repetition
of
the
cross
and
the
signs
of
the
passion
with
the
emblems
of
saints
and
martyrs
were
interwoven
with
the
ancient
classical
forms
mixed
up
with
the
old
symbolisms
partially
altered
to
suit
their
new
service
of
christian
art
of
course
such
changes
were
inevitable
while
the
old
motives
were
being
translated
to
the
new
uses
the
corselet
of
amasis
the
egyptian
corselet
closely
resembles
the
jewish
ephod
which
probably
was
borrowed
from
egypt
in
rock
church
of
our
fathers
vol
we
find
mention
of
the
consular
trabea
profusely
worked
in
gold
as
being
the
origin
of
the
cope
illustration
pl
mark
book
of
the
four
gospels
in
the
cathedral
library
at
york
it
has
been
suggested
and
disputed
that
the
stole
was
an
adaptation
of
the
latus
clavus
indeed
if
we
compare
the
examples
given
by
bock
we
can
hardly
doubt
that
the
consular
trabea
and
the
latus
clavus
either
served
as
the
models
for
the
christian
bishop
dress
or
were
derived
from
the
same
traditional
sources
such
is
the
intimate
chain
of
design
from
century
to
century
from
age
to
age
from
egypt
to
the
holy
land
and
thence
to
rome
bock
gives
his
authorities
for
saying
that
the
clavus
was
sometimes
an
applied
border
sometimes
a
loose
stripe
hanging
down
in
front
as
may
be
seen
in
two
consular
diptychs
given
in

much
has
been
written
on
this
latus
clavus
its
origin
and
meaning
and
i
shall
return
to
it
in
reference
to
the
chrysoclavus
pattern
and
i
refer
the
reader
who
may
wish
to
enter
more
fully
into
the
questions
raised
by
conflicting
opinions
regarding
the
clavus
to

where
great
learning
and
ingenuity
have
been
expended
without
arriving
at
any
satisfactory
conclusions
this
keeping
to
the
old
lines
and
outward
appearance
as
much
as
possible
was
mainly
due
to
a
regard
for
safety
during
the
persecutions
and
also
to
the
christian
spirit
of
adoption
and
conversion
rather
than
that
of
antagonism
which
influenced
all
their
early
manifestations
this
unchanging
character
of
art
was
also
partly
owing
to
the
absolute
sterility
of
the
ashes
of
roman
imperialism
it
is
true
that
through
the
dark
ages
individual
genius
occasionally
flashed
and
left
a
mark
here
and
there
but
such
phenomena
are
so
rare
that
when
they
occur
we
hesitate
before
we
assign
them
to
that
age
the
art
of
illumination
shows
these
inspired
moments
i
would
point
to
their
drawings
in
the
books
in
the
bodleian
at
oxford
and
the
book
of
the
four
gospels
of
the
tenth
century
in
the
minster
library
at
york
which
are
original
and
graceful
and
have
a
reflection
from
the
classical
traditions
to
an
artistic
eye
they
are
beautiful
plate
the
conscientious
colouring
of
the
mss
is
liturgical
clapton
rolfe
says
that
the
levitical
traditions
in
the
earlier
system
of
decoration
in
the
christian
church
had
a
far
stronger
hold
on
the
popular
mind
than
we
are
willing
now
to
admit
and
that
the
five
levitical
colours
gold
blue
purple
red
and
white
were
retained
in
the
christian
ritual
whenever
we
come
across
figures
of
bishops
the
liturgical
vesture
entirely
agrees
with
the
biblical
description
embroideries
before
the
twelfth
century
generally
preserve
a
character
which
is
nearly
related
to
the
art
which
is
called
lombardic
this
differs
from
what
we
know
of
scandinavian
and
celtic
design
through
illuminated
books
carving
on
stone
crosses
throughout
the
north
of
europe
great
britain
and
ireland
and
the
remains
we
possess
of
their
metal
work
i
am
not
aware
of
any
ecclesiastical
embroideries
which
show
a
celtic
origin
unless
the
intertwined
patterns
on
italian
dresses
in
paintings
of
the
thirteenth
and
fourteenth
centuries
may
be
supposed
to
be
derived
from
that
source
see

fig
in
accounting
for
the
instances
of
evident
oriental
influence
on
christian
art
which
came
through
byzantium
we
must
not
restrict
ourselves
to
searching
out
the
arabian
traditions
but
we
must
remember
also
how
much
babylon
and
persia
as
well
as
india
had
given
to
the
empire
of
the
east
and
these
influences
were
in
full
force
at
the
time
that
christian
art
was
being
organized
we
know
for
example
that
the
great
veil
of
the
temple
at
jerusalem
given
by
herod
was
babylonian
the
materials
linen
silk
and
woollen
on
which
ecclesiastical
embroideries
were
worked
at
rome
and
constantinople
were
accepted
all
over
the
christian
world
the
fabrics
were
plain

came
from

east

in
the
days
of
attalus
all
these
furnished
the
grounds
on
which
needlework
was
lavishly
spent
the
great
veils
which
divided
the
pagan
and
jewish
temples
were
at
first
adopted
in
the
christian
churches
but
they
gradually
disappeared
from
common
use
in
spite
of
occasional
survivals
and
revivals
during
the
dark
ages

was
so
laden
with
splendid
embroideries
by
her
eastern
conquests
that
probably
the
christian
decorators
would
have
availed
themselves
of
some
of
the
accumulated
stores
but
we
have
no
record
of
such
adaptations
unless
the
splendid
curtains
and
the
silver
hangings
of

stephen

were
taken
out
of
some
imperial

between
early
ecclesiastical

and
that
which
immediately
preceded
it
in
the
palaces
of
the
cæsars
at

tivoli
and
wherever
we
find
their
ruined
glories
is
most
remarkable
the
lovely
and
the
lively
had
been
suddenly
abandoned
for
the
heavy
earnest
solemnity
and
inartistic
drawing
of
the
frescoes
of
the
underground
church
of
clemente
in
rome
and
that
of
the
early
christian
mosaics
it
is
as
if
the
arts
which
had
lent
nay
given
themselves
to
the
glorification
of
idols
had
suddenly
died
out
leaving
behind
them
neither
an
artist
nor
a
skilled
artisan
scarcely
a
tradition
the
new
christian
ideas
had
to
be
painfully
recorded
on
sacred
buildings
and
their
furnishings
for
more
than
a
thousand
years
with
all
the
patient
acquiescence
of
untaught
ignorance
and
the
struggling
uncertainty
of
genius
pursuing
a
distant
glimmering
light
apparently
unconscious
of
all
that
had
preceded
it
in
egyptian
and
classic
art
the
great
political
and
religious
revolutions
in
europe
had
crushed
and
buried
the
arts
under
the
ruins
of
the
empire
over
which
time
himself
seemed
to
have
broken
his
so
little
was
there
to
show
any
memory
of
their
past
or
hope
for
their
future
the
alternate
progress
and
destruction
of
the
arts
in
european
civilization
strike
the
student
in
vivid
contrast
with
the
immutability
of
those
of
the
east
especially
in
india
and
china
where
the
old
forms
were
still
being
maintained
by
the
swaddling
bands
of
codified
custom
that
had
restricted
their
development
but
prolonged
their
existence
and
so
they
had
survived
while
greece
conquered
and
robbed
the
east
and
egypt
and
rome
crushed
greece
and
was
in
her
turn
despoiled
by
the
goths
and
huns
christian
art
had
to
begin
at
the
very
beginning
and
collect
its
own
traditions
and
organize
its
own
forms
these
gradually
accumulated
availing
themselves
of
accepted
symbols
and
adding
to
them
hidden
meanings
the
reformation
checked
this
development
in
the
north
of
europe
but
after
years
we
are
now
witnessing
its
revival
which
is
not
merely
owing
to
a
religious
impulse
but
also
to
the
archæological
tendency
of
our
day
and
to
the
historical
interest
we
attach
to
the
ceremonials
of
the
east
as
the
reformation
in
germany
was
less
sweeping
and
iconoclastic
than
our
own
we
find
there
many
more
remains
of
ecclesiastical
art
collected
in
the
churches
to
which
they
have
always
belonged
or
in
museums
into
which
they
have
drifted
and
the
germans
have
thus
been
enabled
to
do
more
than
even
the
french
in
training
the
different
schools
of
work
throughout
the
continent
they
have
proved
the
oriental
character
of
the
fabrics
employed
through
the
dark
and
middle
ages
for
about
years
whether
they
were
syrian
indian
alexandrian
greek
sicilian
or
spanish
or
whether
they
had
come
from
asia
by
the
north
or
the
south
of
europe
the
same
traditional
forms
governed
them
all
but
an
adept
is
able
generally
to
class
and
name
each
specimen
by
the
texture
of
the
webs
by
the
way
gold
or
gilt
thread
is
inwoven
in
them
whether
the

is
pure
or
alloyed

or

its

among
the
earliest
historical
church
embroiderers
the
foremost
figure
is
that
of
the
empress

the
mother
of
constantine
claimed
in

and
in
the

of
the

of

being

embroidery
described
in
the
chapter
on
english
work
christian
art
before
the
twelfth
century
is
very
often
rich
usually
picturesque
from
its
fulness
of
intention
sometimes
beautiful
when
it
recalls
some
echo
from
the
east
or
some
tradition
of
greek
art
but
the
embroideries
of
those
centuries
are
almost
always
quaint
this
is
invariably
the
archaic
phase
of
all
early
art
born
in
the
catacombs
of
rome
roused
by
impulses
from
the
north
by
education
in
the
south
and
everywhere
encouraged
by
the
fostering
hand
of
the
church
and
the
patronage
of
papal
and
of
royal
and
imperial
houses
it
evolved
its
forms
and
emancipated
itself
at
last
from
its
poor
and
sordid
condition
and
the
gothic
phase
of
each
nation
attained
to
its
own
peculiar
growth
and
characteristics
and
among
them
the
foremost
in
the
world
estimation
was
the
english
school
of
embroidery
to
which
the
next
chapter
is
devoted
there
has
been
much
controversy
as
to
the
date
of
the
dalmatic
of
charlemagne
in
the
vatican
treasury
like
every
good
early
piece
of
gothic
work
in
italy
it
is
allotted
to
the
days
of
pope
boniface
viii
thirteenth
century
but
when
we
examine
this
splendid
relic
we
can
not
doubt
that
it
is
of
a
much
earlier
time
as
there
is
nothing
gothic
to
be
found
in
it
it
is
full
of
the
lingering
traces
of
greek
art
not
byzantine
it
reminds
us
most
of
the
mosaics
of
santa
pudenziana
which
are
always
quoted
to
prove
that
greek
art
still
survived
in
rome
in
the
eighth
century
the
dalmatic
has
been
much
restored
but
i
believe
most
carefully
kept
to
the
old
lines
it
is
worked
on
a
thick
or
purple
satiny
silk
which
had
entirely
fallen
into
little
stripes
but
has
been
skilfully
mended
and
the
embroidery
has
never
been
transferred
on
the
front
is
our
lord
in
glory
saints
below
and
angels
above
with
a
border
of
children
playing
which
is
truly
greek
the
motive
of
this
is
the
ibi
et
ubi
on
the
back
is
the
transfiguration
and
on
the
humerals
are
the
sacraments
of
bread
and
wine
the
whole
as
art
is
beautiful
and
it
is
historically
most
interesting
lord
lindsay
tells
us
that
in
the

by

horsemen

on

and

this
dalmatic
must
be
ranked

the

never
served

except
as
being
perhaps
dedicated

him
on

it
one
is
convinced
that
it
is
english
it
has
one
peculiarity
of

the

is
most
beautiful

we
can
only
regret
the
loss
of
the

has
been
entirely
cut
off
this
shows
how
elaborate
is
the

yet
how
artistically
arranged
as

it
is
difficult
to
settle
the
precedence
between
this
splendid
piece
of

and
the
rival

bologna

the
museo
civico
said
to
have
come
from
the
church
of
san
giacomo
it
resembles
in
style

execution
that
of

its
architectural
arrangement
contains
six
circles
of
subjects
worked
like
the
other
in

and
gold
with
gold
groundings
and
both
are
embroidered
on

careful
examination

come
to
the
conclusion
that
it
is
english
plate
the
daroca

lately

to
the
archæological
museum

is
undoubtedly
english
we
can
claim
it
by
its
peculiar

the
twined

indeed
there

that
this
is
correct

the

it

been
justified
by
its

abbé
martin
considers
that
in
the
thirteenth
century
the
opening
out
of
gothic
art
was
extended
to
the
laity
and
was
really
the
sign
of
a
great
social
revolution
gothic
art
had
till
then
only
served
the
church
and
had
been
by
circumstances
closed
to
the
people
who
were
yet
unfitted
by
their
want
of
education
for
artistic
life
art
was
till
then
almost
exclusively
produced
by
the
monastic
orders
into
which
all
talent
had
drifted
but
about
this
time
it
fell
into
the
hands
of
architects
and
other
originators
of
design
who
presently
banded
themselves
together
into
brotherhoods
and
guilds
embroidery
till
the
thirteenth
century
had
been
entirely
in
the
hands
of
cloistered
women
and
the
ladies
who
practised
it
learned
their
craft
with
the
rest
of
their
education
in
convents
and
their
work
was
simply
ecclesiastical
and
dedicatory
at
that
period
social
burgher
life
in
the
towns
had
first
begun
to
develope
its
love
of
luxury
and
to
follow
the
fashions
of
other
countries
and
the
changes
of
forms
in
dress
and
furnishing
which
came
from
foreign
parts
though
frequently
checked
by
sumptuary
laws
this
social
movement
preceded
everywhere
political
and
religious
revolutions
embroidery
then
became
customary
in
lay
dress
and
lost
its
religious
character
or
rather
its
religious
monopoly

thirteenth

we
find
that
about
this
time
throughout
the
church
the
forms
of
ecclesiastical
garments
were
considerably
modified
and
made
more
comfortable
for
the
officiating
priest
and
the
old
traditional
trabea
was
cut
down
to
the
mediæval

english
needlework
of

had
its

style

ornament
branching
across
the
on

doors
when
we
meet
with
this
kind
of
design
on
foreign
church
vestments
we
feel
inclined
always
to
claim
the
merit
of
them
for
the
english
school
the
foreign
patterns
are
much
lighter
and
more
geometrical
and
have
not
the
firmness
and
at
the
same
time
the
fancy
that
we
find
in
our
own
of
the
twelfth
century
and
they
remind
us
rather
of
the
goldsmiths
than
of
the
blacksmiths
craft
the
english
embroidery
of
this
style
has
the
character
of
appliqué
one
material
laid
upon
another
and
fastened
down
there
are
differences
of
opinion
as
to
the
accepted
characteristics
of
the
opus
anglicanum
which
in
the
twelfth
century
began
to
be
celebrated
some
say
that
it
was
principally
remarkable
for
its
admixture
of
jewellers
work
in
the
borders
or
the
imitation
of
it
in
gold
thread
some
give
the
attempt
to
reproduce
the
effect
of
in
the
embroidered
groups
of
figures
others
again
point
out
the
peculiarities
of
the
laid
stitches
in
gold
which
so
permeated
the
linen
grounding
as
to
give
the
look
of
a
material
woven
with
gold
thread
we
may
fairly
say
that
these
which
were
then
ingenious
novelties
combined
to
give
this
opus
anglicanum
its
value
as
well
for
its
beauty
as
for
its
ingenuity
the
syon
cope
now
one
of
the
treasures
of
art
in
the
kensington
museum
is
a
perfect
example
of
this
work
and
is
also
according
to
bock
one
of
the
most
beautiful
among
the
liturgical
vestments
of
the
olden
period

to
be
found

study
of
this
piece
of
thirteenth
century
work
in
his
catalogue
of
the
embroideries
in
the
south
kensington
museum
is
most
interesting
as
exemplifying
all
the
characteristics
of
the
gothic
art
of
the
period
in
its
historical
æsthetic
heraldic
liturgical
emblematical
and
textile
aspects
i
have
ventured
to
transcribe
the
whole
of
this
notice
in
the
appendix
i
will
only
add
here
that
the
one
error
into
which
i
think
he
has
fallen
is
in
naming
the
stitches
the
diapers
are
not
opus
plumarium
but
opus
pulvinarium
of
the
class
of
laid
stitches
this
was
ascertained
by
examining
the
back
of
the
material
under
the
ancient
lining
by
a
most
competent
judge
in
my
presence
and
so
a
point
is
set
at
rest
plate
ciampini
says
that
in
the
twelfth
century
the
arts
went
hand
in
hand
each
lending
something
to
the
design
of
the
others
this
however
has
always
been
the
case
whether
they
greatly
profited
by
such
exchanges
is
another
question
i
can
not
but
agree
with
theory
that
textile
art
was
a
leading
influence
and
constant
suggestion
to
art
from
the
beginning
and
the
way
that
ecclesiastical
decoration
was
so
led
in
the
twelfth
century
is
very
apparent
in
the
new
art
of
stained
mosaic
glass
in
church
windows
we
see
the
reflex
of
the
flat
illuminations
and
embroideries
of
that
period
and
while
these
were
being
influenced
by
painting
was
being
transferred
again
to
textile
art
pictures
being
woven
as
well
as
embroidered
while
textiles
were
seeking
to
emulate
reliefs
in
a
forced
and
unnatural
manner
more
ingenious
than
artistic
while
england
in
the
twelfth
and
thirteenth
centuries
was
exciting
the
admiration
of
all
european
artists
by
the
imitation
of
in
needlework
by
the
arrangement
of
the
light
and
shadows
in
the
lay
of
the
stitches
and
by
a
little
help
from
the
pressure
of
hot
irons
to
accentuate
its
apparent
indentations
a
similar
inroad
into
the
sister
art
of
sculpture
or
perhaps
we
should
say
a
similar
adaptation
from
the
sister
art
was
going
on
in
switzerland
and
germany
especially
in
bavaria
there
was
a
clever
and
artistic
mode
of
stuffing
and
raising
of
the
important
parts
of
the
embroidered
design
such
as
the
figures
the
or
the
emblems
of
the
passion
in
sacred
subjects
in
imitation
of
there
are
some
beautiful
specimens
that
have
been
evidently
designed
in
the
school
of
cranach
i
will
only
mention
the
orphrey
of
which
the
subject
is
the
tree
of
jesse

the
chasuble
at

in

grisons
and
the
little
triptych
in

last
is

pretty
the
finest
however
is
the

borghese
at

is
certainly
german
in
its

beautiful
as
these

examples
are
they

show
the
mistake
of
mixing
different
forms
of
art
the
designs
are
reduced
to
a
compromise
between
painting
sculpture

needlework

excites
interest
and
perhaps
amusement
rather

admiration

we
have
no
notice

many
of

to
embroideries

intended
to
give
colour

which
otherwise
were
cold
and
lifeless
in
the
composition

the
avoidance
of
pictorial
effects
especially
any
perspectives
show
that
it
was
intended
for
conventional
decoration
rather
than
as
a
rival
to
mural
painting
there
is
no
doubt
that
it
generally
superseded
textile
hangings
because
it
supplied
the
want
of
colour
for
the
large
traceried
windows
just
coming
into
architectural
design
toning
down
the
crudeness
of
the
masses

which
it
was
cast
when
coloured

came
into

use

mostly
disappeared

may
have
been
the
cause
there
is
no

of
the
coincidence

which

centuries

before

spirit
of
the
renaissance
crept
northward
over

preceding
the
reformation
and
its
iconoclastic
effacements
this
remark
especially
applies
to
england
the
art
of
representing
scriptural
subjects
in
flat
stitches
as
medallions
accompanied
by
beautiful
foliage
and
heraldic
designs
is
illustrated
to
us
by
the
palls
belonging
to
several
london
companies
and
by
those
belonging
to
churches

the
perfection
of

never
been
exceeded
and
it
continues
still
to
produce
the
most
splendidly
executed
compositions
in
gold
and
silken
needlework
of
every
variety
of
stitches
the
flemish
work
and
its
peculiar
mode
of
laying
golden
grounds
with
thread
stitched
down
in
patterns
was
carried
into
italy
where
great
artists
did
not
disdain
to
design
for
textiles
i
give
as
an
instance
vasari
account
of
the
embroidered
set
of
vestments
designed
by
antonio
pollaiolo
for
the
church
of
san
giovanni
at
florence
these
were
carried
out
by
paolo
da
verona
and
took
years
for
their
completion
and
they
were
only
one
set
of
vestments
embroidered
by
the
most
subtle
master
of
the
art
paolo
da
verona
a
man
most
eminent
in
his
calling
and
of
incomparable
ingenuity
the
figures
are
no
less
admirably
executed
with
the
needle
than
drawn
by
pollaiolo
with
the
pencil
and
thus
we
are
largely
indebted
to
one
master
for
his
design
and
to
the
other
for
his
patience
plate
towards
the
end
of
the
fifteenth
century
the
gothic
styles
were
replaced
by
the
renaissance
but
the
technical
part
of
the
art
of
embroidery
for
the
churches
lost
none
of
its
value
all
the
talent
of
the
artist
and
the
ingenuity
of
the
craft
continued
to
be
lavished
on
altar
decoration
and
priestly
garments
in
flanders
spain
france
and
italy
but
the
solemnity
of
these
works
was
certainly
impaired
by
their
being
emancipated
from
the
traditional
ecclesiastical
forms
and
their
accompanying
symbolism
to
which
the
old
designers
had
so
faithfully
adhered
ecclesiastical
decorative
art
became
so
to
speak
unorthodox
as
a
proof
of
this
secular
i
might
almost
say
irreverent
spirit
i
quote
bock
accusation
against
queen
mary
of
hungary
who
in
her
embroideries
preserved
at
is
said
to
have
represented
herself
as
the
queen
of
heaven
surrounded
by
her
adorers
on
their
knees
there
is
no
doubt
however
that
needlework
aspired
in
the
fourteenth
and
fifteenth
centuries
to
the
highest
place
in
art
and
was
enthusiastically
cultivated
by
women
of
rank
and
position
of
artistic
taste
who
still
gave
themselves
to
the
productions
of

ecclesiastical
motives
first
the

arabesques

the

to

and
finally
since
the
beginning
of

century
to
a
conglomerate
lawless
imitation
of
forms
and
styles
utterly
meaningless
and
uninteresting
as
well
as
wanting
in
ecclesiastical
dignity
and
decorum
we
are
glad
to
believe
that
we
are
ourselves
striving
to
reconstruct
some
sort
of
style
that
shall
be
able
to
express
poetical
and
religious
ideas
especially
in
our
church
decorations
at
any
rate
it
must
be
of
some
use
to
understand
the
hidden
springs
which
once
raised
ecclesiastical
embroideries
and
especially
those
of
england
so
high
as
objects
of
beauty
worthy
to
adorn
the
house
of
god
and
to
be
for
centuries
valued
as
monuments
of
pious
industry
and
thoughtful
art
one
of
these
hidden
springs
and
ancient
underlying
motives
was
the
symbolism
which
gave
a
religious
intention
to
the
smallest
design
for
the
humblest
use
provided
that
its
purpose
was
the
service
of
the
church
sacred
symbolism
is
a
subject
to
which
i
have
alluded
more
than
once
and
it
has
played
such
an
important
part
in
the
construction
and
growth
of
ecclesiastical
art
that
i
can
not
but
give
a
short
notice
to
the
subject
under
this
aspect
symbolism
in
art
is
what
metaphor
is
in
speech
it
is
the
representation
to
the
eye
of
an
object
which
suggests
something
else
besides
itself
rock
tells
us
that
the
symbolism
of
scripture
texts
was
given
to
the
world
in
a
book
by
melito
bishop
of
sardis
its
title
is
the
key
in
the
fourth
century
were
produced
two
great
works
on
scriptural
symbols
that
of
st
basil
in
his
homilies
on
the
six
days
of
the
creation
and
that
by
ambrose
both
entitled
hexameron
we
meet
this
subject
at
every
turn
in
the
succeeding
centuries
till
in
the
twelfth
we
find
it
formulated
and
divided
into
branches
bestiaria
volucraria
and
lapidaria
and
each
type
had
frequently
more
than
one
meaning
thus
a
lion
represented
power
sovereignty
dominion
also
the
house
of
judah
a
hare
the
emblem
of
man
soul
a
peacock
that
of
wisdom
the
ruby
represents
love
the
pearl
innocence
the
twelve
stones
in
a
breastplate
the
twelve
tribes
of
israel
trees
and
flowers
had
also
their
symbolical
meanings
though
we
are
not
aware
of
their
being
recorded
in
any
mediæval
book
we
know
that
the
vine
is
the
tree
of
life
the
stem
of
jesse
the
sacramental
emblem
that
the
lily
stands
for
purity
the
woodbine
for
chastity
and
the
rose
for
religious
ecstasy
the
crowned
lily
was
always
the
special
emblem
of
the
virgin
these
symbols
had
many
of
them
a
distant
source
and
had
been
as
i
have
already
indicated
emblematic
of
other
inner
meanings
in
the
expression
of
pagan
faiths
the
tree
of
life
was
babylonian
the
horn
persian
the
of
the
prehistoric
cross
egyptian
or
indian
and
the
composite
animals
representing
many
qualities
ninevite
probably
accadian
all
these
were
utilized
so
that
their
already
accepted
uses
should
be
helps
and
adjuncts
instead
of
impediments
to
the
appreciation
of
divine
truths
in
the
same
way
that
all
that
was
lovely
and
of
good
repute
in
the
belief
and
morals
of
the
ancient
peoples
reasserted
and
purified
was
claimed
by
the
new
teachers
as
types
and
antitypes
the
symbolism
of
colours
has
been
always
considered
very
important
in
liturgical
decoration
and
their
meanings
are
discussed
in
the
chapter
on
colour
the
mystical
colours
as
has
been
already
stated
are
five
red
blue
purple
white
and
gold
these
the
christian
church
inherited
from
the
levitical
law
and
continued
faithful
to
them
till
the
modern
roman
use
introduced
green
and
black
the
church
of
england
before
the
reformation
never
allowed
any
but
the
original
five
mystic
colours
the
symbolism
of
ecclesiastical
embroideries
as
well
as
that
of
all
christian
art
being
intended
to
illustrate
the
truths
of
christianity
by
the
teaching
of
the
eye
the
great
symbol
of
our
faith
the
naturally
drew
to
itself
all
its
prehistoric
forms
as
being
the
prophetic
types
of
the
true
cross
the
earliest
form
of
the
prehistoric
cross
illustration
is
supposed
to
refer
to
the
worship
of
the
sun
and
is
said
to
be
formed
of
two
for
producing
fire
by
friction
laid
across
each
other
this
is
almost
universal
in
prehistoric
archaic
classical
and
christian
art
to
the
thirteenth
century
the
next
most
ancient
form
is
a
broken
cross
thus
illustration
said
to
be
the
double
of
the
tau
or
egyptian
sign
of
life
and
claimed
by
the
rabbins
as
having
been
the
sign
in
blood
which
stopped
the
hand
of
the
angel
of
death
over
the
doors
of
the
israelites
at
the
first
passover
this
afterwards
was
called
the
gammadion
from
its
likeness
to
a
doubled
greek
gamma
and
it
was
also
said
to
symbolize
the
the
third
commonest
form
apparently
a
modification
of
that
of
the
illustration
is
to
be
found
throughout
celtic
and
scandinavian
art
and
was
called
in
england
the
fylfote
from
its
likeness
to
the
arms
of
the
isle
of
man
and
likewise
the
gammadion
though
it
shows
another
source
than
the
greek
letter
from
these
three
forms
already
in
use
added
to
that
of
the
crucifixion
endless
varieties
were
composed
to
suit
the
ecclesiastical
taste
and
requirements
of
different
national
styles
of
symbolical
decoration
i
refer
my
readers
to
plate
in
the
chapter
on
patterns
for
a
few
of
these
from
different
sources
they
are
extremely
suggestive
i
have
there
entered
more
fully
into
the
subject
regarding
it
as
a
fertile
pattern
motive
in
textile
art
the
cross
bearing
twelve
fruits
for
the
saving
of
the
nations
is
so
like
some
of
the
representations
of
the
persian
or
indian
tree
of
life
that
the
transmission
and
adoption
of
the
symbolic
form
is
evident
the
cross
plate
is
a
good
mediæval
example
and
is
taken
from
the
celebrated
cope
at
rheims

with
gold

the
roës
is
an
ecclesiastical
pattern
of
wide
use
and
of
very
long
descent
often
named
in
ancient
church
inventories
it
is
sometimes
called
the
wheel
and
plate
its
origin
is
probably
oriental
but
it
certainly
was
adopted
by
the
romans
as
the
motive
of
their
triumphal
garments
the
worn
in
the
processional
return
of
a
conqueror
whether
he
were
a
general
or
a
sovereign
the
first
motive
was
a
surface
covered
with
circles
closely
touching
each
other
and
containing
figures
which
had
a
reference
to
their
purpose
in
christian
times
the
heads
of
saints
were
sometimes
inserted
especially
in
that
form
of
the
roës
called
the
chrysoclavus
from
the
intersticial
ornament
between
the
circles
i
have
written
about
the
trabea
which
on
the
roman
consular
ivory
diptychs
of
several
centuries
is
so
invariably
embroidered
with
this
same
clavus
pattern
plate
that
we
must
conclude
that
it
had
a
meaning
and
a
tradition
the
very
ancient
superstition
that
driving
in
a
nail
is
a
fortunate
rite
may
have
been
connected
with
the
pattern
called
the
clavus
and
the
chrysoclavus
from
being
merely
a
nail
pattern
became
consecrated
in
christian
art
as
representing
the
heads
of
the
nails
of
the
crucifixion
and
hence
its
early
christian
name
it
was
originally
filled
in
with
a
radiated
ornament
like
the
sun
probably
the
first
motive
of
this
pattern
which
seems
to
be
the
same
as
the
egyptian
and
its
peculiar
decoration
remained
in
possession
of
the
descriptive
name
palmated
though
it
is
difficult
to
discover
in
it
any
likeness
to
the
palm
branch
or
tree
unless
it
is
supposed
to
resemble
it
as
seen
from
above
the
toga
triumphalis
was
also
called
the
toga
picta
because
its
precious
purple
fabric
was
covered
with
gorgeous
embroideries
after
it
had
been
worn
at
the
triumph
or
festival
by
the
victorious
general
the
distinguished
noble
or
the
emperor
it
was
laid
by
and
dedicated
in
the
temple
of
jupiter
capitolinus
thus
these
palmated
triumphal
patterns
and
their
traditional
decorations
having
by
their
dedication
to
the
gods
assumed
a
religious
character
were
woven
for
christian
ecclesiastical
use
during
the
dark
ages
and
were
repeated
in
sicily
and
spain
down
to
the
beginning
of
the
fifteenth
century
i
have
elsewhere
spoken
of
the
cloud
pattern
which
is
very
ancient
chinese
indian
and
mediæval
its
use
has
always
been
for
celestial
subjects
in
embroidery
either
isolating
or
supporting
spiritual
figures
this
was
appropriated
by
ecclesiastical
art
and
we
find
it
nowhere
else
in
europe
this
sketch
of
the
history
of
ecclesiastical
needlework
necessarily
incomplete
from
want
of
space
is

works
of

the
comparison

i
repeat
that
there
is
nothing
new
in
the
treatment

having
been

only
innovation

the
last
years

many
of
the
ancient
stitches
have
lost
their
distinctiveness
and
fallen
into
a
pitiful
style
by
gradual
descent
which
reached
its
lowest
point
in
the
early
part
of
this
century
as
is
shown
by
the
robes
embroidered
for
the
coronation
of
charles
in
the
museum
of
the
louvre
in
the
commencement
of
this
our
nineteenth
century
there
was
a
total
cessation
of
embroidery
which
had
for
nearly
years
held
its
own
as
an
art
apart
from
all
others
perhaps
a
secondary
one
yet
mixed
up
with
every
refinement
and
luxury
of
civilization
its
revival
in
england
especially
is
owing
to
many
causes
as
ecclesiastical
decoration
i
have
already
attributed
it
to
the
archæological
tendencies
of
our
day
as
well
as
to
the
æsthetic
sentiment
which
protests
after
so
long
a
period
of
abstention
against
the
puritanical
bareness
and
coldness
of
our
national
forms
of
worship
the
obliteration
of
embroidery
from
the
list
of
the
arts
was
more
complete
in
england
than
elsewhere
as
the
church
of
rome
still
continued
to
be
adorned
with
beautiful
work
on
and
frontals
and
priest
dresses
which
though
too
much
regulated
in
design
by
the
lay
tastes
and
fashions
of
the
time
have
combined
to
keep
up
a
traditional
school
of
needlework
throughout
the
continent
exhibitions
abroad
and
at
home
have
shown
us
what
a
latent
power
in
art
embroidery
still
preserves
and
architects
have
employed
the
women
needles
to
give
colour
and
beauty
to
the
decaying
churches
which
have
been
restored
to
their
original
architectural
effects
by
careful
copies
of
what
remained
in
wood
stone
and
glass
the
number
of
new
churches
has
also
given
rise
to
the
production
in
more
than
one
establishment
of
beautiful
and
effective
works
such
as
the
at
durham
and
those
at
canterbury
and
worcester
such
works
have
revived
the
impulse
of
artistic
and
ecclesiastical
taste
and
in
many
small
churches
we
have
seen
beautifully
embroidered
altar
decorations
there
are
however
many
amateurs
who
are
perhaps
mistresses
of
the
craft
of
needlework
and
who
are
yet
not
educated
sufficiently
to
design
a
really
thoughtful
and
beautiful
work
of
art
and
to
these
a
few
remarks
may
be
addressed
which
may
help
the
struggling
aspirants
and
show
them
how
they
fail
and
where
to
seek
for
assistance
i
shall
begin
by
pleading
for
more
careful
design
and
less
parsimony
in
expenditure
upon
the
usual
church
adornments
it
is
once
more
a
received
dogma
in
ecclesiastical
art
one
in
which
all
religious
opinions
agree
that
the
building
in
the
parish
which
is
set
apart
for
the
first
public
duty
that
of
worship
should
show
as
much
beauty
as
the
means
and
taste
of
the
community
can
command
perhaps
the
little
church
has
just
been
restored
or
completely
rebuilt
from
the
foundations
the
consecration
is
imminent
the
white
stone
carved
or
plain
shines
fresh
and
cold
and
the
whole
space
looks
poor
and
bare
the
rich
woman
of
the
neighbourhood
sees
and
feels
that
colour
is
wanting
for
the
windows
must
wait
till
their
use
as
pious
memorials
fills
them
with
glowing
tints
the
central
point
of
the
whole
edifice
the
altar
calls
for
the
first
in
colour
to
be
struck
and
a
splendid
is
the
fitting
instrument
she
consults
the
architect
who
probably
is
also
an
artist
and
the
design
is
agreed
upon
and
hurriedly
drawn
and
carried
out
for
there
is
not
a
moment
to
lose
if
it
is
to
be
ready
for
the
opening
day
it
may
be
beautiful
and
it
sometimes
is
so
but
the
mere
want
of
time
for
due
consideration
often
results
in
the
commonplace
ornamentation
which
neither
satisfies
the
eye
nor
the
mind
it
is
often
only
a
mere
bit
of
colour
and
a
mediæval
pattern
and
has
no
apparent
motive
or
meaning
to
give
it
value
one
sometimes
finds
that
a
conventional
form
has
been
selected
of
which
the
emblematic
intention
it
originally
expressed
has
been
forgotten
or
overlooked
therefore
while
to
the
unlearned
it
conveys
no
meaning
it
is
read
as
absolute
nonsense
by
the
ecclesiastical
archæologist
simply
because
it
is
worked
in
a
language
of
undeciphered
hieroglyphics
unknown
to
the
worker
meaningless
reminding
us
of
the
inscriptions
of
which
the
pictured
words
seem
to
have
been
copied
at
random
for
their
prettiness
or
the
arabian
lettering
on
some
of
the
ancient
sicilian
textiles
which
is
nonsense
the
sense
and
the
emblematic
meaning
are
forgotten
and
the
conventional
form
an
empty
shell
is
alone
retained
conveying
no
idea
and
reduced
to
the
low
purpose
of
being
a
pretty
pattern
vague
and
unintelligent
i
have
so
often
said
that
a
pattern
always
originally
possessed
and
should
always
retain
a
meaning
that
i
fear
to
become
tiresome
but
i
repeat
it
here
as
in
ecclesiastical
design
it
is
more
important
than
elsewhere
the
meanings
are
deeper
and
convey
more
essentially
solemn
traditions
and
allusions
if
the
motive
of
the
designer
is
evident
and
is
conscientiously
worked
out
its
value
receives
an
enduring
quality
and
its
present
interest
is
enhanced
embroidery
is
not
less
eloquent
than
her
in
the
teaching
of
divine
lessons
and
appealing
through
the
beauty
of
form
and
colour
to
the
poetical
instincts
of
the
congregation
of
which
the
least
educated
members
almost
unconsciously
feel
the
influence
and
besides
the
people
are
always
alive
to
the
charms
of
symbolism
when
it
is
placed
within
their
reach
as
a
proof
of
this
among
our
own
peasantry
and
mechanics
i
would
point
to
their
universal
enjoyment
of
the
pilgrim
progress
in
the
symbolism
of
art
the
thoughts
which
are
individual
to
the
artist
can
only
be
expressed
by
known
forms
and
colours
even
as
the
poet
must
employ
the
words
and
the
metres
already
accepted
by
the
literature
of
his
language
hurry
is
fatal
to
art
but
another
and
very
serious
cause
of
its
deterioration
is
its
costliness
in
the
dark
and
mediæval
ages
time
was
of
no
account
skilled
labour
such
as
was
needed
for
carving
illuminations
and
embroideries
was
freely
given
as
the
duty
of
a
life
for
one
particular
object
the
good
of
a
man
soul
the
cloistered
men
and
women
worked
for
no
wages
neither
to
benefit
themselves
nor
their
descendants
hardly
for
fame
that
was
given
to
the
convent
which
had
the
credit
of
patronizing
and
producing
art
while
the
very
name
of
the
artist
was
forgotten
it
was
from
pure
love
of
the
art
as
a
craft
and
the
belief
that
it
was
a
good
work
in
which
they
were
engaged
and
from
their
abundant
leisure
that
they
were
enabled
to
evolve
the
lovely
creations
which
delight
and
astonish
us
when
shown
in
the
sacristies
and
treasuries
of
foreign
religious
houses
and
churches
where
they
have
been
cherished
for
centuries
like
the
silkworm
they
spent
themselves
and
by
their
industrious
lives
were
surrounded
in
their
living
graves
by
the
elaborated
essence
of
their
own
natures
a
joy
and
consolation
to
themselves
and
a
legacy
to
all
time
to
them
also
art
appeared
as
the
consoler
but
to
return
to
the
grievances
of
cheapness
and
hurry
economy
of
pence
and
hours
these
often
are
the
bane
of
the
work
which
we
give
to
the
church
sometimes
as
a
memorial
sometimes
as
a
the
colours
are
bad
because
cheap
dyes
fade
and
none
others
can
be
had
without
much
trouble
and
we
have
only
time
to
select
among
those
that
are
for
sale
the
work
is
poor
because
it
must
be
done
quickly
and
we
can
not
afford
to
delay
and
pay
for
the
extra
hours
necessary
to
make
the
stitches
worthy
and
capable
of
lasting
possibly
we
can
not
give
the
time
ourselves
nor
can
find
any
one
effectually
to
organize
and
overlook
the
work
though
the
design
the
motive
the
colours
and
materials
as
well
as
the
stitches
need
to
be
each
carefully
studied
yet
we
perhaps
accept
an
ancient
drawing
intended
for
a
different
place
and
use
and
thus
we
fail
to
produce
any
effect
with
uncongenial
surroundings
sometimes
we
feel
obliged
to
take
the
design
forced
upon
us
by
a
shopwoman
as
ignorant
as
ourselves
with
the
submissive
hope
that
it
will
do
now
to
a
truly
artistic
mind
it
would
appear
that
each
little
church
however
simple
and
devoid
of
ornament
requires
its
own
special
colours
and
design
besides
the
individual
motive
of
the
giver
and
people
forget
that
the
whole
effect
in
any
such
compositions
must
be
comprehensive
and
that
one
careless
mistake
spoils
all
the
high
church
in
its
love
of
ritualistic
vestments
has
sometimes
been
prejudicial
to
the
general
adoption
of
properly
studied
altar
decorations
as
there
is
a
common
suspicion
that
a
personal
wish
for
ornament
akin
to
a
woman
addiction
to
fine
clothes
governs
all
his
attempts
to
adorn
the
altar
whereas
there
should
be
and
there
often
is
a
real
artistic
feeling
for
the
fitness
of
things
in
the
furnishings
of
the
most
beautiful
building
set
aside
by
the
community
for
the
glory
of
god
but
it
is
not
necessary
for
beautiful
effects
that
there
should
be
any
coloured
vestments
when
the
clergy
are
duly
robed
in
the
orthodox
surplice
and
scarves
there
is
perhaps
something
funereal
in
the
white
linens
and
black
geneva
silk
but
yet
the
traditional
white
and
black
have
their
own
value
against
a
background
of
and
reredos
splendidly
coloured
now
that
in
spite
of
prejudice
church
decoration
is
so
much
the
custom
of
our
day
it
is
worth
our
while
to
consider
seriously
how
best
to
carry
it
out
and
search
into
the
principles
which
may
apply
to
all
ecclesiastical
embroideries
whether
they
are
to
be
dedicated
in
the
minster
the
village
church
or
the
home
chapel
we
must
begin
by
remembering
that
in
these
days
if
we
can
not
do
the
work
ourselves
it
must
be
highly
paid
for
the
skilled
artisan
who
is
no
artist
receives
enough
to
feed
his
family
according
to
the
higher
wages
of
the
time
the
woman
slow
stitchery
has
to
support
probably
as
many
claims
and
yet
it
is
always
grudged
as
being
too
costly
the
sculptor
or
the
painter
who
succeeds
in
obtaining
employment
is
highly
paid
but
the
designer
for
or
embroideries
occupies
an
unrecognized
place
in
art
and
barely
earns
enough
to
live
by
the
illuminator
has
ceased
to
exist
he
would
starve
probably
has
been
starved
out
long
ago
the
decorative
designer
having
therefore
no
status
has
no
education
and
it
is
almost
impossible
to
find
in
england
an
artist
to
accept
orders
for
thoughtful
ecclesiastical
designs
hundreds
of
boys
and
girls
are
taught
freehand
drawing
and
having
copied
some
casts
and
lithographs
and
drawn
some
without
any
particular
aim
find
a
precarious
living
by
designing
frightful
for
the
million
these
poor
creatures
from
whose
lives
all
ambition
and
originality
have
been
effaced
are
our
decorative
artists
still
a
beautiful
original
design
can
sometimes
be
obtained
and
if
that
is
beyond
our
reach
we
may
courageously
copy
from
ancient
models
selecting
judiciously
what
is
most
suitable
for
our
purpose
the
ecclesiastical
artist
should
be
well
informed
in
the
modes
of
working
a
design
the
stitch
if
selected
without
experience
may
mar
the
effect
of
the
whole
composition
as
some
stitches
of
themselves
convey
the
meaning
of
shadow
and
others
that
of
light
in
ecclesiastical
work
which
is
intended
to
be
effective
in
the
distance
as
well
as
perfect
in
detail
it
is
worth
while
to
weigh
the
claims
of
the
architectural
motive
a
flat
raised
surface
with
an
edge
sufficiently
accentuated
to
catch
a
light
on
one
side
and
cast
a
sharp
shadow
on
the
other
all
flat
stitches
conduce
also
to
this
effect
especially
if
edged
with
a
cord
and
it
is
much
more
striking
than
in
stuffed
work
on
the
stamp
which
has
not
the
incisive
effect
that
is
given
by
the
tool
to
the
sharp
edge
of
stone
or
wood
carvings
if
we
can
afford
to
give
to
our
church
without
stint
let
us
seek
for
the
most
beautiful
textiles
such
as
are
again
woven
in
imitation
of
the
old
fabrics
gratefully
acknowledging
all
that
pugin
ruskin
and
the
foreign
manufacturers
especially
those
at
lyons
have
done
in
the
revival
of
woven
designs
let
us
avoid
those
materials
which
are
easily
spoiled
by
sunshine
dust
and
smoke
and
all
those
that
fray
easily
woollens
are
not
long
lived
crewels
beautiful
as
they
are
are
not
salient
in
their
effect
silks
satins
and
velvet
and
gold
brocades
or
groundings
worked
in
with
gold
thread
are
the
only
materials
worthy
of
bearing
fine
embroidery
fit
to
receive
them
and
capable
of
keeping
them
for
centuries
plushes
and
worsted
velvets
are
unworthy
indeed
they
are
worthless
the
gold
we
employ
must
be
either
pure
passing
or
else
the
chinese
or
japanese
gold
threads
which
differ
in
colour
but
have
each
their
own
value
and
never
tarnish
even
in
the
coal
smoke
of
london
pure
silver
too
is
beautiful
and
if
it
is
really
pure
can
be
kept
bright
with
bread
crumbs
in
composing
the
altar
decoration
for
the
cathedral
or
the
village
church
we
ought
to
take
into
consideration
what
is
suitable
for
the
surrounding
architecture
in
great
spaces
the
majestic
or
frontal
shining
with
gold
and
silver
and
glowing
with
silken
embroideries
recalls
the
splendid
altar
palli
encrusted
with
gems
in
mark
peter
and
other
ancient
churches
and
is
in
perfect
keeping
with
the
high
and
gorgeous
reredos
the
rich
screen
the
fretted
roof
and
clustered
ornaments
of
a
great
cathedral
choir
such
glories
are
unattainable
in
the
modest
village
church
but
though
we
may
subdue
the
brilliancy
of
our
decoration
we
should
try
to
make
it
yet
a
work
of
art
the
design
may
have
as
much
intention
the
work
be
as
refined
and
individual
and
the
gold
as
pure
as
in
larger
works
the
precious
metals
may
be
confined
to
small
spaces
in
the
parts
we
desire
to
accentuate
such
as
the
cross
in
the
centre
or
the
edges
of
the
orphreys
or
they
may
be
entirely
replaced
with
fine
silk
work
the
we
desire
to
present
may
be
simply
a
gift
so
that
we
may
choose
any
design
that
will
agree
with
the
date
of
the
building
we
may
prefer
any
subsequent
style
but
not
one
anterior
to
that
of
the
architecture
it
would
be
a
mistake
to
imitate
ornaments
in
a
church
of
the
flamboyant
style
perhaps
the
we
are
discussing
may
be
intended
as
a
sort
of
votive
offering
a
memorial
of
a
baptism
a
wedding
or
a
funeral
for
the
first
white
silk
worked
in
gold
and
silver
or
silk
or
parsemé
with
conventional
spring
flowers
would
be
appropriate
for
a
marriage
crimson
blue
and
gold
or
a
mixture
of
all
these
to
produce
a
festive
and
gorgeous
effect
for
a
funeral
purple
or
violet
silk
or
velvet
with
palms
and
the
crown
of
thorns
in
gold
or
silver
these
would
serve
at
the
festivals
of
the
church
the
purple
for
good
friday
the
crimson
for
days
the
white
for
christmas
and
easter
sunday
the
reredos
or
the
screen
curtain
behind
the
altar
should
be
made
available
for
enhancing
its
effect
as
well
as
for
enlarging
the
area
of
textile
coloured
decoration
as
this
is
intended
for
a
background
it
should
be
either
subdued
or
else
contrasting
in
juxtaposition
with
that
which
it
is
intended
to
supplement
woollen
embroideries
or
tapestries
are
the
most
usually
selected
for
this
purpose
the
softness
of
fine
crewels
is
well
shown
near
the
more
glowing
tints
of
silk
velvet
and
gold
of
the
altar
frontal
if
this
is
white
or
light
coloured
the
reredos
hanging
should
be
of
dark
or
richly
worked
material
if
the
frontal
is
dark
the
contrast
should
be
preserved
by
hangings
of
tender
shades
the
pulpit
and
with
their
small
cushions
and
veils
and
beautiful
worked
covers
for
the
books
give
opportunities
for
repetition
of
colour
which
is
often
required
for
picturesque
effect
i
should
recommend
the
young
ecclesiastical
designer
to
study
the
principles
which
guided
the
authors
of
some
of
the
fine
gothic
examples
remaining
to
us
such
as
the
great
stoneyhurst
cope
and
the

of
the
different
london
companies
as
well
as
the
very
few
fine
still
existing
all
these
have
their
brilliant
and
effective
treatment
they
are
intended
to
be

either
represent

anciently
the
ornaments
for
the
different
church
services
which
we
timidly
reduce
to
floral
decorations
often
however
very
beautifully
planned
and
executed
gave
the
opportunity
for
displaying
costly
embroidered
hangings
the
paschal
of
the
choir
of
durham
for
example
was
a
marvellous
construction
of
wood
and
gilding
and
probably
hangings
it
was
as
wide
as
the
lateral
of
the
choir
and
as
high
as
the
building
so
that
the
central
and
seventh
candlestick
that
from
which
the
new
fire
for
the
year
was
kindled
was
so
near
the
roof
that
there
was
a
fine
convenience
through
the
said
roof
of
the
church
for
the
help
of
lighting
it
i
quote
from
a
rare
book
printed
by
ross
for
waghorn
this
little
book
is
full
of
interesting
matter
regarding
durham
cathedral
though
the
author
is
most
concerned
in
relating
the
vandalisms
committed
by
the
dean
wife
whittinghame
who
evidently
had
no
culture
and
a
strong
turn
for
appropriating
odds
and
ends
such
as
tombstones
embroidered
silk
and
other
curiosities
which
she
deemed
valueless
except
for
her
own
purposes
such
a
woman
is
a
real
archæological
misfortune
the
corporax
used
in
celebrating
the
mass
by
cuthbert
in
the
seventh
century
he
died
and
was
buried
at
holy
isle
in
was
supposed
to
be
endowed
with
miraculous
powers
and
was
carried
into
battle
on
many
occasions
as
a
banner
this
banner
was
of
crimson
velvet
on
both
sides
wrought
with
flowers
in
green
silk
and
gold
and
fringed
with
red
silk
and
gold
the
corporax
cloth
was
inserted
in
the
centre
and
covered
with
a
square
of
white
velvet
having
on
it
a
cross
of
red
velvet
most
artificially
worked
and
fringed
with
little
silver
bells
in
the
fringe
this
was
carried
into
battle
till
dame
whittinghame
did
most
injuriously
destroy
the
same
in
her
fire
one
feels
as
if
this
woman
were
spiteful
as
well
as
stupid
but
for
her
punishment
her
memory
is
kept
quite
the
contrary
to
green
by
waghorn
careful
record
of
her
iniquities
which
has
at
the
same
time
fortunately
preserved
to
us
the
description
of
the
banner
of
cuthbert
and
gives
also
an
idea
of
the
good
and
sumptuous
furniture
of
changeable
suits
and
of
the
divers
vestments
wrought
and
set
round
about
with
pearls
both
stoles
and
flannels
looking
at
it
from
a
distance
it
appears
that
the
fair
white
linen
for
the
communion
service
always
requires
the
softening
of
the
edges
by
fringes
by
cut
work
embroidery
or
by
thick
lace
edgings
if
a
white
ground
for
embroidery
is
required
nothing
is
more
beautiful
than
linen
especially
if
it
is
not
white
in
art
should
be
represented
by
the
nearest
approach
to
no
colour
but
it
is
more
agreeable
to
the
eye
by
its
being
tempered
with
a
suggestion
of
the
natural
tint
of
which
all
textile
substances
possess
something
excepting
cotton
before
they
have
passed
through
the
hands
of
the
fuller
or
the
chemist
corporals
and
veils
for
the
pyx
used
to
be
of
white
linen
embroidered
with
white
silk
or
linen
thread
the
silk
gives
a
beautiful
varied
shining
brightness
i
think
a
few
words
should
be
said
about
the
fringe
its
motive
and
is
the
disposal
of
the
threads
of
the
warp
when
it
is
cut
out
of
the
frame
these
being
tied
and
knotted
symmetrically
become
an
artistic
decoration
instead
of
an
untidy
tangle
of
threads
and
thrums
edging
the
material
and
finishing
it
with
its
own
loose
ends
is
a
very
ancient
custom
and
we
can
see
from
the
sculptures
of
nineveh
that
they
were
great
in
that
city
in
the
art
of
and
the
israelites
when
they
made
their
hangings
for
the
sanctuary
trimmed
them
with
fringes
it
stands
to
reason
that
an
added
fringe
should
be
arranged
with
reference
to
the
origin
of
the
decoration
and
the
moment
we
think
of
it
the
eye
is
annoyed
by
seeing
a
deep
fringe
of
one
or
two
colours
traversing
the
whole
widths
of
the
frontal
and
quite
irrelevantly
and
without
any
reference
to
the
masses
of
colours
woven
or
embroidered
above
them
and
the
consequence
of
this
carelessness
is
that
it
makes
it
look
as
if
this
part
of
the
decoration
came
from
another
source
independent
of
the
composition
which
it
ought
to
supplement
the
fringe
should
belong
to
the
whole
design
and
be
carefully
fitted
to
the
spaces
occupied
by
the
colours
above
it
each
of
its
compartments
or
divisions
being
filled
in
with
those
tints
which
are
most
conspicuous
in
the
general
design
and
would
show
effectively
in
the
warp
it
is
not
necessary
to
account
for
all
the
colours
as
the
threads
employed
to
form
the
woof
would
naturally
disappear
at
the
sides
of
the
web
the
sections
of
the
fringe
should
be
skilfully
arranged
so
as
to
reappear
at
equal
distances
or
at
least
they
should
be
so
balanced
as
to
produce
that
effect
if
this
is
impossible
the
fringe
should
be
all
of
one
shade
matching
exactly
the
ground
of
the
textile
it
may
be
relieved
by
clustered
knobs
or
hanging
beads
or
cups
of
different
colours
and
gold
the
celebrated
pluvial
at
has
a
fringe
of
gold
bells
hanging
to
a
gold
cord
which
amalgamates
with
the
pattern
the
veils
of
the
sanctuary
in
the
wilderness
were
fringed
with
attached
ornaments
bells
blossoms
knops
flowers
and
fruit
which
sounds
extremely
pretty
to
resume
let
me
once
more
urge
that
in
church
work
neither
time
nor
trouble
be
spared
nor
yet
money
grudged
if
possible
the
design
should
be
full
of
intention
the
stitching
perfect
and
the
materials
most
carefully
chosen
for
tints
for
endurance
and
smoothness
remember
that
no
inferior
substitute
will
serve
to
give
present
effect
nor
will
it
last
into
the
future
design
as
i
have
elsewhere
said
is
all
the
better
for
being
to
a
certain
degree
circumscribed
relegated
and
regulated
by
the
laws
of
traditional
usage
as
well
as
those
of
good
taste
and
this
applies
especially
to
ecclesiastical
design
these
laws
serve
as
the
frame
which
encloses
the
motive
thought
and
makes
it
a
complete
whole
that
can
admit
of
no
amplifications
new
symbols
should
not
be
adopted
except
for
the
expression
of
new
facts
or
altered
circumstances
and
these
can
but
seldom
enter
into
liturgical
art
there
is
so
much
already
formulated
and
admitted
and
the
area
in
which
we
may
gather
our
materials
is
so
large
that
we
need
not
seek
for
more
than
we
find
under
our
hand
ready
for
use
besides
the
symbolism
of
dogma
we
have
all
the
heraldry
of
the
saints
and
can
repeat
and
vary
the
emblems
of
those
to
whom
the
church
we
are
working
for
is
dedicated
the
keys
of
peter
the
sword
of
paul
the
lilies
of
the
virgin
the
cross
of
andrew
the
eagle
of
john
i
need
hardly
enumerate
all
these
legitimate
sources
of
decoration
then
there
is
the
lay
heraldry
which
belongs
to
the
history
of
each
church
and
which
memorializes
the
reign
of
the
monarch
when
it
was
begun
finished
or
restored
and
the
pious
work
and
care
of
the
founder
and
benefactor
the
architect
and
sometimes
that
of
the
sculptor
now
as
our
forefathers
accepted
all
this
material
for
ecclesiastical
design
remodelling
it
to
their
own
uses
in
different
centuries
so
we
can
not
ourselves
do
better
than
imitate
them
and
profit
by
their
experience
never
missing
an
opportunity
of
studying
ancient
embroideries
and
while
we
admire
in
them
all
that
is
admirable
and
appreciate
their
historical
and
archæological
value
we
may
yet
extract
greater
benefit
for
ourselves
by
criticizing
what
is
imperfect
as
well
as
what
is
possibly
a
descent
and
failure
from
a
higher
type
we
must
make
a
judicious
selection
of
what
to
imitate
and
what
to
avoid
as
a
general
rule
i
should
warn
the
young
artist
against
the
imitation
of
naïveté
and
quaintness
especially
in
our
designs
for
church
embroidery
as
it
is
hardly
a
noble
quality
in
art
though
we
look
on
it
with
a
tender
pity
between
admiration
and
contempt
when
we
find
it
inevitably
in
mediæval
work
struggling
to
overcome
the
expression
of
something
difficult
and
expressing
a
difficulty
only
partly
overcome
we
find
ourselves
putting
our
minds
into
the
attitude
of
the
artist
who
conceived
those
figures
with
arms
conventionally
growing
out
of
the
encasing
garment
conventionally
holding
a
book
and
giving
a
blessing
with
a
conventional
twist
not
entirely
ungraceful
nor
devoid
of
a
certain
dignity
rather
felt
than
perceived
yet
we
contemplate
them
with
a
smile
of
conscious
superiority
appreciating
our
own
refined
sense
of
their
merits
and
infantine
progress
towards
something
good
that
time
a
long
time
would
and
did
evolve
but
those
efforts
at
last
culminated
in
a
christian
art
such
as
is
seen
in
the
splendid
forms
and
adornments
in
stone
gold
silver
glass
and
embroideries
of
the
thirteenth
and
fourteenth
centuries
such
splendours
as
the
windows
of
bourges
the
at
paris
or
those
of
the
cathedral
of
toledo
or
king
college
chapel
at
cambridge
such
sculptures
and
traceries
as
those
of
the
puits
de
moise
at
dijon
and
the
chapter
house
at
southwell
in
nottinghamshire
such
embroideries
as
the
syon
cope
and
the
borghese
triptych
these
are
types
worthy
of
all
praise
and
they
are
full
of
instruction
to
the
student
of
ecclesiastical
art
the
kensington
museum
offers
us
endless
help
and
suggestions
in
its
very
interesting
collection
of
liturgical
vestments
of
every
date
and
school
and
its
textiles
illustrated
by
the
inventory
of
their
learned
collector
rock
are
most
instructive
in
the
library
of
that
museum
are
to
be
found
many
of
the
learned
works
on
these
subjects
by
french
and
german
the
exhibitions
in
the
english
counties
are
never
without
a
case
or
a
room
full
of
embroideries
collected
from
the
of
the
neighbouring
churches
and
country
houses
and
especially
from
those
of
the
ancient
roman
catholic
families
the
colleges
of
oscott
and
stoneyhurst
have
collected
by
purchase
or
by
gift
many
fine
relics
of
the
craft
which
are
most
liberally
granted
for
exhibition
for
those
who
can
go

carefully
preserved

and
many
styles
and
showing
endless
varieties
of
design
which
can
be
employed
on
new
works
by
careful
selection
and
adaptation
most
of
these
belong
to
the
eleventh
and
succeeding
centuries
any
earlier
examples
are
fragmentary
and
have
generally
been
taken
from
the
tombs
of
kings
and
bishops
it
seems
to
savour
of
desecration
this
opening
of
shrines
and
disturbing
the
ashes
of
the
illustrious
dead
if
only
for
the
satisfaction
of
archæological
curiosity
but
except
where
it
has
hitherto
been
protected
by
the
sanctity
of
the
tomb
there
is
so
little
that
remains
to
us
so
few
textiles
have
survived
the
friction
of
use
or
even
that
of
the
air
through
as
many
as
a
thousand
years
or
more
that
we
may
plead
the
hunger
for
truth
and
the
eager
desire
for
proofs
of
identity
and
verification
of
historical
legends
which
are
to
be
extracted
from
the
shape
of
a
garment
from
the
pattern
on
the
border
or
the
lettering
on
the
web
of
which
it
is
composed
whence
we
reverently
cut
a
fragment

it
under

before

this
chapter
i
would
wish
to
observe
that
i
have
entered
into
the
subject
of
church
decoration
in
no
ritualistic
spirit
i
do
not
treat
it
theologically
but
as
art
and
if
these
decorations
are
to
be
carried
out
at
all
i
feel
that
i
am
rendering
a
service
to
those
whose
duty
or
pleasure
it
is
to
provide
them
by
pointing
out
where
they
may
find
the
principles
which
have
been
the
spring
and
life
of
mediæval
art
and
the
survivals
which
are
now
the
best
exponents
of
those
principles
to
guide
us
in
the
works
of
our
day
footnotes
in
early
christian
art
was
for
nearly
a
thousand
years
primitively
barbarous
with
occasional
exceptions
the
rapid
decline
in
europe
through
the
art
of
the
catacombs
and
clemente
at
rome
and
the
frescoes
and
mosaics
of
ravenna
down
to
the
bayeux
tapestries
is
very
remarkable
in
those
inartistic
compositions
during
the
early
middle
ages
the
figures
were
drawn
facing
the
spectator
the
head
and
feet
in
profile
differing
in
nothing
from
the
egyptian
and
assyrian
modes
of
representation
we
can
hardly
account
for
this
return
to
childish
ways
from
which
greece
and
rome
had
so
long
been
emancipated
except
by
supposing
that
they
came
from
the
imitations
of
oriental
textiles
which
still
retained
very
ancient
forms
for
instance
the
motive
of
the
sculptured
lions
over
the
gate
of
mycenæ
we
can
not
say
that
greek
art
in
rome
was
quite
extinct
till
the
eighth
century
about
that
time
there
was
a
remarkable
revival
in
england
till
very
lately
we
have
been
entirely
dependent
on
the
frescoes
in
the
catacombs
and
in
the
underground
church
of
clemente
at
rome
and
on
monumental
art
and
illuminations
for
our
knowledge
of
the
textiles
of
the
earliest
days
of
christianity
but
herr
discoveries
in
egypt
will
when
published
add
greatly
to
our
information
on
this
subject
the
book
by
parker
on
the
liturgical
use
says
that
only
the
five
liturgical
colours
were
permitted
in
the
use
of
the
church
of
england
before
the
reformation
the
norman
and
english
liturgical
colours
were
different
rock

of
our
fathers
ii
p
perhaps
nothing
was
originally
worked
departing
from
this
rule
but
votive
offerings
are
inventoried
as
being
of
all
colours
having
been
accepted
and
used
as
decoration
and
for
vestments
i
have
already
spoken
of
the
custom
of
clothing
the
images
of
the
gods
as
a
classical
tradition
the
greeks
draped
their
statues
in
precious
garments
often
the
spoils
of
subjugated
nations
offerings
from
the
conquerors
or

by
its

that
greek

was
still
a
living
power
of
which
we
have
yet
examples
on

however

the
great
superiority
of

as
information
about
our

must
be
valuable
to
us
i
give
a
short
account
of
english
embroidery
in
england
our
art
like
our
language
is
mixed
our
early
history
is
one
of
repeated
conquest
and
we
can
only
observe
where
style
has
flowed
in
from
outside
or
has
formed
itself
by
grafting
upon
the
stem
full
of
vitality
already
planted
and
growing
it
is
interesting
to
seek
its
root
there
is
every
reason
to
believe
from
the
evidence
of
the
animal
remains
of
the
neolithic
age
including
those
of
sheep
that
they
came
with
their
masters
from
the
central
plateau
of
asia
the
overlap
of
the
asiatic
civilizations
over
the
barbarism
of
northern
europe
shows
that
assyria
as
well
as
egypt
was
a
highly
organized
empire
and
the
mediterranean
peoples
far
advanced
in
the
arts
of
life
while
the
neolithic
man
survived
and
lingered
in
britain
france
and
scandinavia
yet
even
at

the
craft
of
spinning

the
use
of
the
needle
were
practised
by
the
women
of

our

glimpses

their
neglect
of
the
people
they
conquered
we
benefited
little
by
their
civilization
all
that
we
know
of
their
decorative
art
in
britain
is
that
it
was
with
few
exceptions
chiefly
of
small
bronze
statues
somewhat
crude
and
colonial
as
appears
from
the
remains
of
their
architecture
sculpture
mosaics
and
tombs
of
their
textiles
we
have
no
relics
and
hardly
know
of
any
recorded
if
we
except
the
works
of
the
empress
helena
see
we
must
remember
that
as
she
was
a
british
princess
it
is
likely
that
she
had
learnt
her
art
at
home
and
therefore
that
the
women
of
england
were
already
embroiderers
as
early
as
the
beginning
of
the
fourth
century
on
the
departure
of
the
romans
chaos
ensued
till
the
britons
who
had
called
in
the
saxons
to
help
them
were
by
them
driven
into
wales
brittany
and
ireland
which
last
they
christianized
and
mingled
the
art
of
the
germans
and
celts
with
that
of
the
danes
and
norsemen
all
which
may
be
traced
in
the
irish
remains
to
be
seen
in
the
college
museum
at
dublin
and
elsewhere
from
the
time
that
england
became
literature
law
and
art
began
to
crystallize
and
when
under
egbert
one
kingdom
was
formed
out
of
the
heptarchy
order
and
a
sense
of
beauty
were
in
the
course
of
development
then
came
the
invasion
of
the
danes
ninth
century
who
robbed
destroyed
and
arrested
all
artistic
improvement
till
alfred
got
rid
of
them
for
a
time
early
in
the
seventh
century
the
women
of
england
had
attained
great
perfection
in
needlework
this
appears
from
a
passage
in
a
poem
by
adhelme
bishop
of
sherborne
he
speaks
of
their
shuttles
filled
not
with
purple
only
but
with
various
colours
moved
here
and
there
among
the
thick
spreading
threads
he
had
himself
a
robe
of
a
most
delicate
thread
of
purple
adorned
with
black
circles
and
peacocks
this
may
or
may
not
have
been
woven
in
england
but
at
that
time
weaving
as
well
as
needlework
was
the
delight
and
occupation
of
the
ladies
of
the
court
and
of
the
cloistered
nuns
the
thralls
slaves
or
serfs
were
employed
in
weaving
in
the
houses
of
the
nobles
probably
they
embroidered
also
lawrence
sees
reason
to
believe
that
in
the
seventh
century
silk
and
fine
linen
were
the
materials
for
altar
decorations
vestments
and
dress
whereas
the
hangings
of
the
house
were
of
coarse
canvas
adorned
with
embroidery
in
thick
worsted
she
says
the
term
broiderie
was
reserved
for
the
delicate
works
on
fine
grounds
in
silk
and
gold
and
silver

enrichments

tenth
century
it
was
probably
on
account
of
such
derelictions
from
orthodox
subjects
of
design
that
in
the
eighth
century
the
council
of
cloveshoe
admonished
the
convents
for
their
frivolous
embroideries
in
the
eighth
century
our
english
work
in
illuminations
and
embroideries
was
finer
than
that
of
any
continental
school
and
therefore
in
view
of
the
great
advance
of
these
secondary
arts
we
may
claim
that
we
were
then
no
longer
outer
barbarians
though
our
only
acknowledged
superiority
over
continental
artists
was
in
the
workrooms
of
our
women
and
the
cells
of
our
religious
houses
during
the
terrible
incursions
of
the
danes
and
the
many
troubles
that
accrued
from
these
barbarous
and
idolatrous
invaders
the
convents
and
monasteries

those
of
the
order
of
benedict
kept
the
sacred
flame
of
art
burning
both
monks
and
nuns

illuminated

and
embroidered
they
evidently
continued
their
relations
with
foreign
art
for
it
is
difficult
to
say
at
what
period
the
norman
style
began
to
be
introduced
into
england
it
was
the
outcome
of
the
romanesque
and
of
this
different
phases
must
have
come
to
us
through
the
danes
and
the
saxons
i
can
not
but
dwell
on
the
early
life
and
springtide
of
our
anglican
christian
art
which
in
many
points
preceded
and
surpassed
that
of
other
northern
nations
as
we
arose
from
that
period
commonly
called
the
dark
ages
ours
was
a
gradual
development
adding
to
itself
from
outer
sources
new
strength
and
grace
the
better
perfection
of
details
and
patterns
was
succeeded
by
ingenuity
and
refinement
in
drawing
the
human
figure
the
art
which
was
native
to
england
may
be
judged
by
the
rare
examples
that
we
possess
and
of
which
we
may
well
be
proud
though
we
must
remember
with
shame
how
much
was
destroyed
at
the
reformation
enough
however
remains
to
prove
that
our
english
art
of
illumination
of
the
ninth
tenth
and
eleventh
centuries
was
very
beautiful
and
we
are
not
surprised
therefore
to
find
in
the
embroideries
of
that
period
grace
and
artistic
feeling
the
stole
and
maniple
of
the
durham
cathedral
library
which
bear
the
inscription
aelfled
fieri
precepit

are
of
the
most
perfect
style
of
design
and
the
stitching
of
the
silk
embroidery
and
of
the
gold
grounding
are
of
the
utmost
perfection
of
needlework

the
history
of
this
embroidery
is
carefully
elucidated
by
raine
in
his
saint

says
that
frithestan
was
consecrated
bishop
in
by
command
of

was

fairly
be
said

proved

have
notices

very
remarkable
pieces
of
work
the
danish
queen
emma
daughter
of
richard
duke
of
normandy
when
she
was
wife
to
ethelred
the

and
again
during

marriage
to
canute
gave
the
finest
embroideries
to

and

canute
being
then
a

joined
her
in
these
splendid
votive
offerings
to

gave

in

i
come
now
to
the
earliest
large
work
remaining
to
us
of
the
period
the
bayeux
tapestry
we
must
claim
it
as
english
both
on
account
of
the
reputed
worker
and
the
history
it
commemorates
though
the
childish
style
of
which
it
is
a
type
is
indeed
inferior
in
every
way
to
the
beautiful
specimens
which
have
been
rescued
from
tombs
in
durham
worcester
and
elsewhere
they
seem
hardly
to
belong
to
the
same
period
so
weak
are
the
designs
and
the
composition
of
the
groups
though
rede
fowke
gives
the
abbé
de

rue
doubts
as
to
the
accepted
period
of
the
bayeux
tapestry
which
he
assigns
to
the
empress
matilda
he
yet
leans
to
other
equally
good
authorities
who
consider
the
work
as
being
coeval
with
the
events
it
records
collingwood
bruce
is
of
the
same
opinion
and
for
this
reason
the
furniture
buildings
are
all
of
the
eleventh
century
and
our
ancestors
were
no
archæologists
and
always
drew
what
they
saw
around
them
bruce
fancies
the
design
to
be
italian
because
of
the
energetic
action
of
the
figures
this
seems
hardly
justified
when
we
look
at
the
simple
poverty
of
the
style
miss
strickland
suggests
that
the
artist
was
perhaps
turold
the
dwarf
who
has
cunningly
introduced
his
effigy
and
name
that
the
tapestry
is
not
found
in
any
catalogue
before
is
only
a
piece
of
presumptive
evidence
against

not

its
favour

in
their
castles
while
the
men
were
away
fighting
for
the
cross
for
the
king
for
their
liberties
or
for
booty
this
period
included
the
crusades
the
wars
of
the
roses
wars
with
france
and
rebellions
at
home
and
yet
there
was
a
taste
for
art
luxury
and
show
spreading
everywhere
the
women
were
expected
to
provide
with
their
looms
and
their
needles
the
heraldic
surcoats
the
scarves
and
banners
and
the
mantles
for
state
occasions
they
also
worked
the

for

adorned
the

taste
and
the

have
shared
in
the

of
these

the
taste
for
the
baroc
is
a
new
acquisition
no
one
cared
for
what
was
old
merely
because
it
was

the
rich
replaced
their
hangings
and
their
clothes
when
they
became
shabby
the
poor
let
them
go
to
pieces
and
probably
burned
the
old
stuff
and
the
embroideries
for
the
sake
of
the
gold
thread
which
was
of
intrinsic
value
but
both
in
prose
and
poetry
we
read
descriptions
of
beautiful
works
in

on

executed
by

ladies
for

england
may
claim
to
have
gradually
acquired
a
higher
place
in

our
architecture

and
paintings
were
not
surpassed
on
the
continent
witness
queen
eleanor
crosses
and
her
tomb
in
westminster

and
the
portrait
of
richard
surrounded
by
saints

angels
at

a
picture
which
preceding

by
at

a
quarter
of

yet
suggests
his
style
refined
drawing
and
tender
colouring
all
who
saw
the
frescoes
found
in
the
chapel
at
eton
college
when
it
was
restored
will
remember
their
extreme
beauty
and
regret
that
they
were
effaced
instead
of
being
preserved
and
restored
they
were
a
lesson
in
what
english
art
was
in
the
end
of
the
thirteenth
during
the
fourteenth
and
into
the
beginning
of
the
fifteenth
centuries
during
the
wars
of
the
roses
when
a
duke

said
to
have
begged

fortunate
were
able
to
earn
theirs

the

of
the
eleventh

our
best
authorities
for
the

the
surcoat
of
the

cathedral
is
a
noteworthy
example
the
sculptured
effigy
on
the
tomb
over
which
it
is
suspended
is
absolutely
clothed
in
the
same
surcoat
with
the
same
accidents
of
embroidery
as
if
it
had
been
modelled
from
it
in
worcester
when
the
archæologists
opened
king
john

in
they
found
him
in
the
same
dress
and
attitude
as
that
portrayed
on
the
recumbent
statue

was
then
extravagantly
expensive
and
embroidered

were
worn
with

set
with

the
operation
was
allowed
to
assume
a
certain
air
of
coquetry
but
the
idea
suggests
itself
that
this
was
oftener
the
gift
of
the
fair
weaver
to
her
favoured
lover
to
fold
round
his
arm
as
a
scarf
in
battle
or
tourney
to
be
ready
in
case
it
was
needed
for
binding
up
a
wound
and
had
possibly
served
as
a
snood
to
bind
her

fair
hair
there
is

account
of

there
is
also
good
authority
for
its

the

so
alike

other
peculiarities

such
as
the

it

that
in
the
reign

the

ingeniously
evaded
the
penalties
against
the
excess
of
luxury
in
dress
by
wearing
something
that
looked
as
gay
but
was
less
expensive
than
the
forbidden
materials
and
which
did
not
come
under
the
letter
of
the
law
they
invented
a
spurious
kind
of
embroidery
which
was
perhaps
partly
painted
such
examples
are
recorded
in
the
henry
vi
it
was
enacted
that
all
such
work
should
be
forfeited

accusation
was
that
divers
persons
belonging
to

make
divers
works
of
brouderie
of
insufficient
stuffe
and
unduly
wroughte

that
they
sell
these

the
great
deceit
of
our
sovereign
lord
and
all
his
people
in
those
days
any
dishonest
work
or
material
was
illegal
and
punishable
this
was
in
fact
a
protectionist
measure
in
favour
of
the
chartered
embroiderers
and
gave
them
a
slight
taste
of
the
advantages
of
protection
for
a
time
it
was
doubtless
useful
in
keeping
up
the
standard
of
national
work
then
followed
further
measures
for
the
benefit
of
the
established
monopolies
first
a
statute
in
henry
vi
forbidding
the
importation
of
foreign
embroideries
for
five
years

is
under
edward
richard
and
henry
vii
and
was
partially
repealed
in
the

george
iii
while
we
are
on
this
subject
we
may
remark
that
in
the
importation
of
embroidery
was
forbidden
to
the
east
india
company
and
we
closed
our
ports
to
all
manufactured
indian
goods
the
only
artistic
trade
protected
is
that

foreign

being
permitted

enter
england
not
even
do
we
allow
indian
plate
to
come

under
certain
conditions
this
may
be
the
reason
that
our
own
plate
is
so
very
bad

design
and
execution

want
of
competition

protection
is
always
more
or
less
fatal
to

the
wars
of
the
roses
had
injured
our
own
best
schools
and
we
needed
refined
imported
ideas
to
raise
our
standard
once
again
perhaps
since
embroidery
had
become
a
regular
industry
our
markets
were
overstocked
by
home
productions
which
were
outrivalled
by
the
works
from

it

that
several
committed
suicide
in

it
was
worse
than
the
miseries
caused
by

now
ingenuity
in

was

do
not

that
thou
be

we
can
not
say
how
much
of
french
taste
was
imported
from
this
meeting
of
french
and
english
luxury
the
spirit
of
the
renaissance
fresh
from
italy
was
reigning
in
france
but
we
had
also
in
italy
our
own
emissaries
john
of
padua
was
probably
only
one
of
many
englishmen
who
travelled
to
learn
and
improve
themselves
in
their
special
crafts
catherine
of

introduced
the
spanish
taste
in
embroidery
which
was
then
white

black
silk

on
fine
linen

this
went
by
the
name
of
spanish
work
and
continued
to
be
the
fashion
down
to
and
through
the
reign
of
mary
tudor
who
remained
faithful
to
the
traditions
of
her
mother
and
her
grandmother

catherine
of

learned
her
craft
from
her

queen
isabella

always
made
her

shirts
to
make
and
adorn
a
shirt
was
then
an
artistic
feat
not
unworthy
of
a
queen
isabella
instituted
trials
of
needlework
amongst
her
ladies
in
the
days
of
her
disgrace
and

catherine
turned
to
her
embroidery
for
solace
and
occupation

came
forth
to
meet
the
cardinals
wolsey

with
a
skein
of

silk
round

did

catherine

brought
with
her
the
taste
for

german
renaissance
designs
and
all

in

and
we
have
lists
of
her

worked
in
spanish
stitches
black
and
gold
or
black

only
this
taste
following
the
political
tendencies
of
the
time
entirely
disappeared
under
elizabeth
it
survives
however
in
peasant
dress
in
the
low
countries
queen
elizabeth
spent
much
of
her
time
in
needlework
she
herself
had
received
the
education
of
a
man
as
well
as
her
cousin
lady
jane
grey
and
doubtless
many
women
were
taught
at
that
time
greek
and
latin
and
to
study
philosophy
mathematics
and
the
science
of
music
as
a
training
for
serious
life
elizabeth
studied
and
embroidered
too
at
any
rate
she
stood
godmother
to
many
pieces
of
embroidery
which
are
to
be
seen
still
in
the
houses
she
visited
or
occupied
while
at
ashridge
and
afterwards
as
a
prisoner
at
hatfield
she
so
employed
herself
and
among
the
specimens
of
work
of
the
sixteenth
century
exhibited
at
south
kensington
in
were
her
shoes
and
cap
worked
in
purl
a
semainière
in
the
same
stitch
also
in
divers
cushion
stitches
and
a
portmonnaie
in
exquisitely
fine
all
of
which
articles
and
many
more
were
left
by
her
at
ashridge
when
she
was
hurried
away
in
the
dead
of
night
to
hatfield
the
character
of
the
renaissance
of
the
sixteenth
century
just
released
from
the
trammels
of
gothic
traditions
was
somewhat
lawless
in
england
being
unchastened
by
the
classical
element
which
entirely
controlled
the
movement
in
italy
the
queen
dress
soon
departed
from
the
severe
simplicity
which
she
at
first
affected
and
every
part
of
her
costume
was
covered
with
flowers
fruit
and
symbolical
designs
while
serpents
crowns
chains
roses
eyes
and
ears
crowded
the
surfaces
of
the
fine
materials
of
her
dresses
these
symbolical
designs
were
rich
without
grace
and
ingenious
rather
than
artistic

their
workmanship
was
perfect

astonish
us
by
their

perfection
and
shock
us
by
their
naturalistic
crudeness
of
design
and
the
utter
want
of
beauty
or
taste
in
the
whole
effect
the
impression
left
on
the
mind
is
how
dear
it
must
have
cost
the
pocket
of
the
purchaser
and
the
eyes
of
the
workers
there
are
however
exceptions
to
these
defective

designs

in

is
a

on
a

which
is
as
good
as
possible
in
every
respect
and
is
purely
english
in
style
the
stitches
and
materials
are
most
refined
and
varied
purl
which
was
a
newly
made
material
imported
from
italy
and
germany
was
then
in
much
vogue
and
we
have
seen
a
few
fine
specimens
of
it
that
have
been
imitated
from
the
italian
raised
and
stuffed
needlework
which
are
very
curious
and
almost
very
beautiful
only
one
feels
that
the
same
effect
could
have
been
produced
by
simpler
means
this
work
is
characteristic
of
the
reigns
of
henry
elizabeth
and
james

must
accept
this
as
typical
of
the
artistic
oriental
knowledge
of
that
day
grafted
on
the
style
of

it
shows
however
that
indian

were
creeping
in
and
sought

called

then
the
fashion
this
sort
of
work
in

continued
to
be
artistic
but
the
english
specimens
that
have
survived
from
this
reign
are
mostly
very
ugly
continental
art
had
ceased
to
influence
us
and
bad
taste
reigned
supreme
except
in
our
architecture
which
had
crystallized
into
a
picturesque
style
of
our
own
called
james
and
was
the
outcome
of
the
last
gothic
of
henry
viii
and
the
italian
style
of
edward
vi
and
elizabeth
but
the
carvings
of
that
phase
of
architecture
were
nothing
could
have
been
poorer
than
their
composition
or
coarser
than
their
execution

the
other
fashionable
work
of
that
day
had
its
merits
it
was
the
custom
to
embroider
hangings
or
linen
in
crewels
considering
how
often
in
this
book
and
my
preceding
lectures
i
have
said
that
this
style
of
work
was
common
even
in
the
early
days
of
egypt
and
assyria
it
may
well
be
said
when
was
it
the
fashion
and
i
must
answer
only
since
the
days
of
queen
anne
it
seems
as
if
before
that
time
our
designs
for
work
were
partially
influenced
by
the
fine
indian
specimens
which
had
surreptitiously
crept
into
england
some
of
these
are
very
cleverly
executed
huge
conventional
trees

from
a
green
strip
of

carrying
every
variety
of

and

leaf
or

is
often
very
beautiful
on

bank
below
small
deer
and
lions
disport
themselves
and
birds
twice
their
size
perch
on
the
branches
plate
but
even
where
the
work
is
finest
the
incongruities
are
too
annoying
the
modern
excuse
for
it
that
it
is
quaint
does
not
reconcile
us
to
its
extravagant
effect
to
be
quaint
in
art
is
as
i
have
said
before
to
be
funny
without
intending
it
and
these
curtains
are
funny
by
their
absence
of
all
intention
or
perspective
and
when
hung
they
make
everything
in
the
room
look
disproportionate
to
the
unnatural
size
of
the
foliage
plate
specimens
of
this
work
are
to
be
found
in
most
english
country
houses
it
has
lasted
till
now
partly
because
the
crewels
first
manufactured
in
the
sixteenth
century
were
of
an
excellent
quality
and
secondly
because
there
was
no
gold
to
make
it
worth
any
one
while
to
destroy
them
so
the
old
hangings
went
up
into
the
attics
in
all
the
disgrace
of
shabbiness
and
have
come
down
again
as
family
relics
even
the
moths
have
been
deprived
of
their
prey
by
these
curtains
having
served
for
the
beds
of
the
household
so
that
they
have
been
kept
for
their
nearly
years
of
existence
aired
and
dusted
much
of
this
work
has
been
recovered
from
farmhouses
and
cottages
in
tolerable
preservation

many
cases

flowers
have
survived

which
they
were
worked
the
royal
school
of
needlework
has
often
been
commissioned
to
restore
and
transfer
the
crewel

on

a
new
backing
the
hangings
and
the
curtains
i
have
described
prevailed
from
the
end
of
elizabeth
reign
to
that
of
queen
anne
and
gradually
deteriorated
the
stitches
of
which
the
variety
at
first
was
infinite
had
given
place
to
a
coarse
uniform
stem
stitch
gobble
stitch
the
materials
also
were
of
inferior
quality
and
less
durable
so
that
the
latest
specimens
are
in
general
in
the
worst
condition
it
is
remarkable
how
little
the
beautiful
continental
work
influenced
our
english
school
we
were
enjoying
perfect
protection
and
were
clumsily
taking
advantage
of
our
security
from
all
competition
in
the
italian
palaces
this
was
the
moment
of
the
finest
secular
embroideries
in
satin
stitches
gold
and
silver
and
inlaid
and
onlaid
appliqués
likewise
in
spain
and
portugal
the
oriental
work
especially
that
executed
at
goa
filled
the
palaces
and
the
convents
with
gorgeous
hangings
carpets
and
bed
furniture
we
feel
it
painful
to
contrast
with
these
our
own
shortcomings
in
art
and
our
faded
glories
the
fact
is
that
owing
to
our
protectionist
laws
embroidery
had
the
misfortune
to
be
treated
at
that
time
as
textile
manufacture
and
not
as
art
at
all
in
the
reign
of
william
and
mary
dutch
taste
had
naturally
been
brought
to
the
front
this
included
japanese
art
or
imitations
of
it
and
also
had
something
of
late
spanish
the
georges
brought
into
england
and
naturalized
a
rather
heavy
work
in
gold
and
silver
the
design
being
decidedly
a
german
louis
quatorze
richly
stitched
and
heavily
fringed
and
much
employed
on
court
dresses
and
on
state
furniture
we
have
seen
royal
beds
and
court
suits
which
show
very
little
difference
in
style
it
does
not
appear
that
this
was
worked
by
ladies
it
has
somehow
a
professional
look
illustration
fig
part

from
an

occasionally
however
we
meet
with
pieces
of
exceptionally
beautiful
work
of
the
end
of
the
seventeenth
and
early
part
of
the
eighteenth
centuries
the
style
is
the
most
refined
louis
quatorze
but
the
work
is
actually
english
the
white
satin
coverlets
belonging
to
the
marquis
of
bath
and
the
duke
of
leeds
are
not
to
be
exceeded
in
delicacy
and
splendour
the
embroidered
dresses
of
the
duke
and
duchess
of
buckingham
in
westminster
abbey
early
eighteenth
century
are
of
this
description
from
queen
anne
to
george
a
great
deal
of
furniture
was
covered
with
the
different
cushion
stitches
either
in
geometrical
or
kaleidoscope
patterns
or
else
displaying
groups
of
flowers
or
figures
quaint
and
sometimes
pretty
these
designs
are
generally
however
wanting
in
grace
and
their
german
feeling
shows
them
to
be
the
precursors
of
the
berlin
wool
patterns
when
the
hangings
ceased
to
be
the
fashion
home
work
took
another
direction
all
the
ladies
imitated
indian
dimity
patterns
on
muslin
in
coloured
silks
or
thread
with
the
and
needle
but
in
the
broiderers
company
we
presume
found
that
the
indian
manufactures
were
engrossing
the
market
and
a
fresh
statute
was
obtained
forbidding
the
importation
from
india
of
any
wrought
material
this
cruel
prohibition
carried
its
own
punishment
the
indian
trade
was
ours
and
we
might
have
adapted
and
assimilated
the
indian
taste
for
design
we
might
have
brought
over
men
and
women
great
in
their
most
ancient
craft
and
so
produced
the
most
splendid
school
the
portuguese
at
least
sent
out
their
own
silks
and
satins
to
be
worked
at
goa
threw
away
our
chance
and
signed
the
of
our
art
about
the
middle
of
the
last
century
several
ladies
notably
miss
linwood
miss
moritt
of
rokeby
and
delany
copied
pictures
in
worsteds
some
of
these
are
wonderfully
clever
and
even
very
pretty
but
they
are
rather
a
painful
effort
of
pictorial
art
under
difficulties
than
legitimate
embroideries
these
pictures
would
have
served
the
purpose
of
decoration
better
as
medallions
in
the
centres
of
arabesque
panels
than
framed
and
glazed
in
imitation
of
oil
paintings
some
of
the
followers
of
this
school
produced
works
that
are
shocking
to
all
artistic
sense
especially
as
seen
now
when
the
moths
have
spoiled
them
they
can
only
be
classed
with
such
abortive
attempts
at
decoration
as
glass
cases
filled
with
decayed
stuffed
birds
and
vases
of
faded
and
broken
wax
flowers
i
may
record
with
praise
the
efforts
of
pawsey
a
lady
who
started
a
school
of
needlework
at
aylesbury
she
was
patronized
by
queen
charlotte
and
for
her
she
worked
the
beautiful
bed
at
hampton
court
of
purple
satin
with
wreaths
of
flowers
in
crewels
touched
up
with
silk
which
look
as
if
they
might
have
been
copied
from
the
of
a
dutch
master
the
execution
is
very
fine
and
reminds
one
of
the
best
french
work
of
the
same
period
pawsey
taught
and
helped
ladies
to
embroider
in
silk
and
chenille
as
well
as
crewels
and
in
many
country
houses
we
can
recognize
specimens
of
her
style
usually
on
screens
worked
in
silk
and
chenille
with
bunches
of
flowers
in
vases
or
baskets
artistically
designed
this
was
our
last
attempt
at
excellence
immediately
followed
by
the
total
collapse
of
our
decorative
needlework
and
the
advent
of
the
berlin
wool
patterns
postscript
a
postscript
to
this
chapter
will
perhaps
be
acceptable
to
those
who
have
taken
an
interest
in
the
history
of
english
embroidery
and
who
will
therefore
care
to
know
about
the
revival
which
has
filled
so
many
workshops
with
what
is
now
called
art
needlework
there
was
a
public
demand
for
something
better
than
the
worsted
patterns
in
the
trade
and
the
royal
school
of
art
needlework
rose
and
tried
to
respond
to
that
call
by
stimulating
original
ideas
and
designs
and
imitating
old
ones
in
conformity
with
modern
requirements
the
difficulties
to
be
overcome
were
at
first
very
great
the
old
stitches
had
all
to
be
learned
and
then
taught
and
the
best
methods
to
be
selected
the
proper
materials
had
to
be
studied
and
obtained
sometimes
they
had
to
be
manufactured
lastly
beautiful
tints
had
to
be
dyed
avoiding
as
much
as
possible
the
gaudy
and
the
evanescent
the
project
of
such
a
school
was
first
conceived
in
the
autumn
of
lady
welby
herself
an
accomplished
embroideress
had
the
courage
to
face
all
the
difficulties
of
such
an
undertaking
a
small
apartment
was
hired
in
sloane
street
and
dolby
who
was
already
an
authority
on
ecclesiastical
work
gave
her
help
twenty
young
ladies
were
selected
and
several
friends
joined
heartily
in
fostering
the
movement
the
princess
christian
of
gave
her
name
as
president
and
her
active
the
school
grew
so
fast
that
for
want
of
space
for
the
it
had
to
remove
into
a
larger
house
no
sloane
street
and
finally
in
the
year
it
found
its
present
home
in
exhibition
road
when
the
queen
became
its
patron
in
the
association
was
incorporated
under
the
board
of
trade
with
a
managing
and
a
finance
committee
and
a
salaried
manager
to
overlook
the
whole
concern
from
to
ladies
at
a
time

there
received
employment
their
claims
were
poverty
gentle
birth
and
sufficient
capacity
to
enable
them
to
support
themselves
and
be
educated
to
teach
others
branch
schools
have
been
started
throughout
the
united
kingdom
and
in
america
the
education
of
the
school
has
been
much
assisted
by
the
easy
access
to
the
fine
collections
of
ancient
embroideries
in
the
kensington
museum
and
by
the
loan
exhibition
of
old
artistic
work
which
was
there
organized
in
at
the
suggestion
of
the
president
and
since
then
there
have
been
three
very
interesting
loan
exhibitions
in
the
rooms
of
the
royal
school
it
was
indeed
necessary
that
the
acting
members
should
avail
themselves
of
every
means
of
instruction
in
order
to
fit
themselves
for
the
task
they
had
undertaken
they
were
expected
at
once
to
be
competent
to
judge
all
old
work
to
name
its
style
and
date
and
even
sometimes
its
market
value
they
were
to
be
able
to
repair
and
add
to
all
old
work
to
know
and
teach
every

and
modern

suddenly
will
last
perhaps
its
catholicity
may
prolong
its
popularity
and
something
absolutely
new
in

may
be
evolved
which
shall
revive
the
credit
of
the
opus

of
one
thing
we
may
be
sure
that
it
is
inherent
in
the
nature
of
englishwomen
to
employ
their
fingers

busy

as

ignorant
need
a
guide
to
the
principles
of
design
as
well
as
the
technical
details
of
the
art
of
embroidery
this
should
be
supplied
by
the
royal
school
of

which
by
inculcating
careful
drawing
by
reviving
old
traditions
and

ideas
becomes
a
guarantee

footnotes
the
people
of
babylon
the
accadians
had
a
written
literature
and
a
civilization
superior
to
that
of
the
conquering
assyrians
who
borrowed
their
art
of
writing
and
probably
their
culture
which
may
have
been
the
centre
and
of
the
western
civilization
of
asia
and
therefore
the
origin
of
our
own
accadian
civilization
was
anterior
to
that
of
the
phœnicians
and
the
greeks

is
now
received
in

later
years
as
the
original
form

the
heritage
of
mankind
it
has
been
said
that
assyrian

was
destitute

to
that
of
the
accadians
which
they
adopted
we
ourselves
owe
our
first
customs
and
ideas
four
thousand

the
arts
of
spinning
and

were
introduced
into
europe
and
drifted
into
britain

have
been
preserved
with
but
little
variation
from
that
period
down
to
the
present
day
in

remote

have
only
been
superseded

athenian
girls
between
the
ages
of
five
and
ten
were
solemnly
dedicated
to
the
goddess
every
five
years
in
publishing
the
inventory
in
the
british
museum
already
referred
to
hicks
remarks
it
may
have
been
the
custom
sometimes
to
dedicate
to
the
goddess
the
garments
worn
by
children
at
their
presentation
just
as
we
know
that
the
garments
in
which
persons
had
been
initiated
at
the
greater
eleusinia
were
worn
by
them
until
threadbare
and
then
dedicated
to
some
god
if
so
the
number
of
children
clothes
mentioned
in
our
inventory
is
easily
explained
or
were
these
the
clothes
of
children
cut
off
by
artemis
in
infancy
such
as
bereaved
mothers
nowadays
often
treasure
for
years
having
no
temple
wherein
to
dedicate
them
hicks
further
remarks
that
it
was
usual
for
the
bride
before
marriage
to
dedicate
her
girdle
to
artemis
and
at
athens
the
garments
of
women
who
died
in
childbirth
were
likewise
in
like
manner
so
dedicated
it
is
probably
on
account
of
such
dedications
that
artemis
was
styled
chitonè
the
goddess

the
garments
in
this
list
were
dedicated
to
the
goddess
herè
juno
in
her
celebrated
temple
at
samos
the
entries
relate
chiefly
to
articles
of
female
attire
but
some
few
are
dedicated
to
the
god
hermes
some
of
these
articles
were
doubtless
worn
by
the
deities
themselves
on
festive
occasions
when
their
statues
were
decked
out
the
toilet
of
goddesses
was
superintended
by
a
priestess
specially
chosen
for
that
purpose
she
was
called
or
mistress
of
the
robes
in
the
samian
list
of
garments
those
which
are
embroidered
or
ornamented
with
gold
are
specially
noted
some
of
the
tunics
are
described
as
lydian
curtains
or
hangings
are
also
mentioned
in
this
list
these
must
have
been
used
to
ornament
the
interior
of
the
temple
or
to
screen
off
the
statue
of
the
goddess
on
the
days
when
she
was
withdrawn
from
the
gaze
of
the
profane
such
hangings
were
probably
a
main
cause
of
the
conflagrations
by
which
greek
temples
were
from
time
to
time
destroyed
in
spite
of
the
solidity
of
their
walls

it
was

story
is
that
augustus
the
strong
went
to

incognito
at

eighteen
in

of
adventures

distinguished
himself
at

but
perhaps
the
noblest
testimony
to
the
revival
under
the
comneni
is
afforded
by
the
designs
on
the
dalmatic
or
sacerdotal
robe
commonly
styled
papa
san
leone
preserved
in
the
sacristy
of
peter
said
to
have
been
embroidered
at
constantinople
for
the
coronation
of
charlemagne
as
emperor
of
the
west
but
fixed
by
german
criticism
as
a
production
of
the
twelfth
or
the
early
part
of
the
thirteenth
century
the
emperors
wore
it
ever
after
when
serving
as
deacons
at
the
pope
altar
during
their
you
will
think
little
of
it
at
first
sight
and
lay
it
aside
as
a
piece
of
darned
and
faded
tapestry
yet
i
would
stake
on
it
alone
the
reputation
of
byzantine
art
and
you
must
recollect
too
that
embroidery
is
but
a
poor
substitute
for
the
informing
hand
and
the
lightning
stroke
of
genius
it
is
a
large
robe
of
stiff
brocade
falling
in
broad
and
unbroken
folds
in
front
and
behind
broad
and
deep
enough
for
the
stature
and

herculean
chest
of
charlemagne

the
breast

represented
in

amplification
of
no

traditional

bequeathed
this
vestment
to
the
cathedral
of

the
cope
was
stolen
in

from
the
treasury
at
pienza
and
shortly
afterwards
discovered
in

shop
of

dealer
in
antiquities
at

completely
stripped
of
its

of
some
of

here
the

is
arrayed
in
a

and
a
golden
mantle
lined
with
vair
her
head
is
kerchiefed
and
her

sorrowfully

john
whose
dress

all
of

is
on
the
left
at
the
foot
of
the
cross
upon
which
the
saviour
wrought
all
in
silver
a
most
unusual
thing
with
a
cloth
of
gold
wrapped
about
his
loins
is
fastened
by
three
not
four
nails
in
the

is

the
redeemer
in
glory
crowned
as
a
king
and
seated
on
a
cushioned
throne
resting
upon
his
knee
and
steadied
by

is

this

three
parts
of

the
largest
an
upper
horizontal
hemicycle
is
coloured
crimson
now
faded
to
a
brownish
tint
but
the
lower
hemicycle
is
divided
vertically
in
two
of
which
one
portion
is
coloured
green
and
the
other
white
or
silvered
the
next
two
subjects
to
be
described
are
one
on
the
right
hand
the
death
of
the
blessed
virgin
mary
the
other
on
the
left
her
burial
below
the
burial
we
have
our
lord
in
the
garden
signified
by
two
trees
still
wearing
the
crown
of
thorns
our
lord
in
his
left
hand
holds
the
banner
of
the
resurrection
and
with
his
right
bestows
his
benediction
on
the
kneeling
magdalene
who
is
wimpled
and
wears
a
mantle
of
green
shot
yellow
over
a
light
purple
tunic
below
but
outside
the
quatrefoil
is
a
layman
clad
in
gold
upon
his
knees
and
holding
a
long
narrow
scroll
bearing
words
which
can
not
now
be
satisfactorily
read
lowermost
of
all
we
see
the
apostle
philip
with
a
book
in
one
hand
in
the
other
the
flaying
knife
a
little
above
him
peter
with
his
two
keys
one
gold
the
other
silver
and
somewhat
under
him
is
andrew
with
his
cross
on
the
other
side
of
michael
and
the
dragon
is
james
the
greater
sometimes
called
of
compostella
because
he
lies
buried
in
that
spanish
city
with
a
book
in
one
hand
and
in
the
other
a
staff
and
slung
from
his
wrist
a
wallet
both
emblems
of
pilgrimage
to
his
shrine
in
galicia
in
the
next
quatrefoil
above
is
paul
with
his
sword
and
over
to
the
right
thomas
still
further
to
the
right
james
the
less
just
above
is
our
saviour
clad
in
a
golden
tunic
and
carrying
a
staff
overcoming
the
unbelief
of
thomas
upon
his
knees
that
apostle
feels
with
his
right
hand
held
by
the
redeemer
the
spear
wound
in
his
side
as
at
the
left
side
so
here
quite
outside
the
sacred
history
on
the
cope
we
have
the
figure
of
an
individual
probably
living
at
the
time
the
vestment
was
wrought
the
dress
of
the
other
shows
him
to
be
a
layman
by
the
shaven
crown
of
his
head
this
person
must
have
been
a
cleric
of
some
sort
but
we
can
not
tell
for
the
canvas
is
worn
quite
bare
so
that
we
see
nothing
now
but
the
lines
drawn
in
black
to
guide
the
embroiderer
this
churchman
holds
up
another
scroll
bearing
words
which
can
no
longer
be
read
when
this
cope
was
new
it
showed
written
in
tall
gold
letters
more
than
an
inch
high
an
inscription
now
cut
up
and
lost
the
word
and
a
v
on
some
of
the
shreds
are
all
that
remains
of
it
in
its
original
state
it
could
give
us
the
whole
of
the
twelve
apostles
portions
can
still
be
seen
the
lower
part
of
the
vestment
has
been
sadly
cut
away
and
reshaped
with
the
fragments
perhaps
at
that
time
were
added
the
present
heraldic
orphrey
morse
and
border
probably
fifty
years
later
than
the
other
portions
of
this
matchless
specimen
of
the
anglicum
of
angels
the
nine
choirs
and
the
three
great
hierarchies
cherubim
seraphim
and
thrones
are
figured
here
led
a
good
way
by
ezekiel
but
not
following
that
prophet
step
by
step
our
mediæval
draughtsmen
found
out
for
themselves
a
certain
angel
form
to
this
they
gave
a
human
shape
that
of
a
comely
youth
clothing
him
with
six
wings
with
human
feet
instead
of
the
body
being
full
of
eyes
the
wings
are
often
composed
of
the
feathers
of
the
peacock
on
this
cope
the
eight
angels
standing
upon
wheels
are
so
placed
that
they
are
everywhere
nearest
to
those
quatrefoils
wherein
our
lord
person
comes
and
may
therefore
be
taken
as
representing
the
upper
hierarchy
of
the
angelic
host
the
other
angels
not
upon
wheels
no
doubt
belong
to
the
second
hierarchy
while
those
that
have
but
one
pair
of
wings
not
three
represent
the
lowest
hierarchy
all
like
our
lord
are
barefoot
all
of
them
have
their
hands
lifted
in
prayer
for
every
lover
of
english
heraldry
this
cope
so
plentifully
blazoned
with
armorial
bearings
will
have
a
special
value
equal
to
that
belonging
to
many
an
ancient
roll

squares
at

corner
are
wrought
with

and
peacocks
of
curious
interest
for
every
lover
of
mediæval
symbolism
these
coats
of
arms
being
mostly
blazoned
on
shields
suggest
that
possibly
they
record
those
of
the
noble
ladies
who
worked
the
border
while
those
on
circles
may
be
the
arms
of
religious
houses
or
donors
a
word
or
two
upon
the
needlework
how
it
was
done
and
the
now
unused
mechanical
appliance
to
it
after
it
was
wrought
so
observable
on
this
vestment
lending
its
figures
more
effect
we
find
that
for
the
human
face
all
over
this
cope
the
first
stitches
were
begun
in
the
centre
of
the
cheek
and
worked
in
circular
lines
into
which
after
the
first
start
they
fell
and
were
so
carried
on
through
the
rest
of
the
flesh
tints
then
with
a
little
iron
rod
ending
in
a
small
bulb
slightly
heated
were
pressed
down
those
parts
of
the
faces
worked
in
circles
as
well
as
the
wide
dimple
in
the
throat
by
the
hollows
thus
sunk
a
play
of
light
and
shadow
is
brought
out
that
lends
to
the
parts
so
treated
a
look
of
being
done
in
low
relief
upon
the
lightly
clothed
figure
of
our
lord
the
same
process
is
followed
and
shows
a
noteworthy
example
of
the
mediæval
knowledge
of
external
anatomy
we
must
not
however
hide
from
ourselves
that
the
unequal
surfaces
given
by
such
a
use
of
the
hot
iron
to
parts
of
the
work
expose
it
to
the
danger
of
being
worn
by
friction
more
than
other
parts
and
soon
betray
the
damage
by
their
threadbare
dingy
look
as
is
the
case
in
the
example
just
cited
the
method
for
grounding
the
quatrefoils
is
remarkable
for
being
done
in
a
long
zigzag
diaper
pattern
laid
stitch
the
stitching
on
the
armorial
bearings
is
the
same
as
that
now
followed
in
many
trifling
things
worked
in
wool
cross
stitch
the
canvas
or
linen
for
every
part
of
this
cope
is
of
the
finest
sort
but
its
crimson
canvas
lining
is
thick
and
coarse
a
word
or
two
about
the
history
of
this
fine
cope
rock
now
enters
into
the
history
of
the
guilds
which
included
noble
laymen
and
women
and
members
of
the
clergy
and
tells
us
that
the
rolls
of
these
associations
sometimes
grew
to
be
exceedingly
wealthy
he
says
that
each
of
these
guilds
had
usually
in
its
parish
church
a
chapel
or
altar
of
its
own
splendidly
provided
for
to
which
offerings
were
spontaneously
given
by
individuals
or
by
members
clubbing
together
that
their
joint
gift
might
be
the
more
worthy
perhaps
the
cleric
and
the
layman
worked
on
the
cope
may
have
been
the
donors
rock
suggests
that
possibly
coventry
may
have
been
the
place
of
its
origin
where
the
famous
corpus
christi
plays
which
this
cope
so
well
illustrates
drew
crowds
every
year
to
see
them
as
is
testified
by
the
paston
letters
taking
this
old
city
as
a
centre
with
a
radius
of
no
great
length
we
may
draw
a
circle
on
the
map
enclosing
tamworth
tower
and
town
chartley
castle
warwick
charlcote
and
althorp
the
lords
of
these
broad
lands
would
in
accordance
with
the
religious
feelings
of
those
times
become
brothers
of
the
famous
guild
of
coventry
and
on
account
of
their
high
rank
find
their
arms
embroidered
on
the
vestments
belonging
to
their
fraternity
that
such
a
pious
queen
as
the
gentle
eleanor
wife
of
edward
the
first
who
died
should
have
in
her
lifetime
become
a
sister
is
very
likely
so
that
we
may
easily
account
for
the
shield
castile
and
leon
the
other
noble
shields
may
possibly
record
munificent
benefactions
the
whole
must
have
taken
very
long
in
the
working
and
the
probability
is
that
it
was
embroidered
by
the
nuns
of
some
convent
which
stood
in
or
near
coventry
upon
the
banks
of
the
thames
at
isleworth
near
london
henry
built
and
munificently
endowed
a
monastery
to
be
called
for
the
nuns
of
bridget
order
among
the
earliest
friends
of
this
new
house

master

official

one
of
the
ecclesiastical
courts
of
the
kingdom
in
the
syon

a
valuable
lately
bought
by
the
british
museum
this
churchman
is
gratefully
recorded
as
the
giver
to
their
convent
of
several
precious
ornaments
of
which
this
very
cope
seemingly
is
one
it
was
the
custom
for
a
guild
or
religious
body
to
bestow
some
rich
church
vestment
upon
an
ecclesiastical
advocate
who
had
befriended
it
by
his
pleadings
before
the
tribunal
and
thus
to
convey
their
thanks
to
him
with
his
fee
after
such
a
fashion
this
cope
might
easily
have
found
its
way
through
graunt
from
warwickshire
to
middlesex
at
the
beginning
of
elizabeth
reign
it
went
with
the
nuns

they
wandered
in
an
unbroken
body

they
halted
about
sixty
years

they
were
sure
she
had
such
treasures
with
her
as
would
be
hard
to
get
in
iceland
thurida
the
housewife
at
frida
was
envious
and
covetous
of
these
precious
goods
and
received
thorgunna
into
her
home
in
hopes
by
some
means
to
possess
herself
of
them
especially
the
embroidered
hangings
of
a
bed
but
thorgunna
refused
to
part
with
them
i
will
not
lie
in
the
straw
for
thee
though
thou
art
a
fine
lady
and
thinkest
great
things
of
thyself
thorgunna
made
her
own
terms
with
thurida
and
master
harold
and
set
up
her
bed
at
the
inner
end
of
their
hall
her
richly
worked
her
english
sheets
and
silken
quilt
and
her
and
canopy
were
such
that
men
thought
nothing
at
all
like
them
had
ever
been
seen
an
air
of
truth
is
given
to
the
whole
story
by
the
details
thorgunna
is
described
as
tall
and
strong
and
very
stout
she
was
swarthy
brown
with
eyes
set
close
together
her
hair
was
brown
and
very
thick
she
was
in
daily
life
and
went
to
church
every
morning
before
she
went
to
her
work
then
comes
an
account
of
a
storm
and
a
rain
of
blood
and
how
thorgunna
sickened
and
died
and
at
her
own
desire
was
carried
to
be
buried
to
skilholt
which
she
prophesied
would
one
day
be
considered
holy
and
that
priests
might
there
sing
dirges
over
her
there
is
a
curious
and
picturesque
account
of
the
two
days
journey
to
skilholt
and
the
adventures
that
befell
the
funeral
cortége
including
the
incident
of
the
corpse
cooking
the
supper
of
the
convoy
at
an
inhospitable
farmhouse
where
they
had
sought
refuge
and
received
no
entertainment
on
harold
return
home
after
the
funeral
he
proceeded
to
carry
out
the
wishes
of
thorgunna
who
had
warned
him
that
the
ownership
of
her
embroidered
hangings
would
cause
trouble
and
therefore
she
had
desired
they
should
be
burned
thurida
however
could
not
bear
to
lose
them
and
persuaded
harold
to
spare
them
after
this
followed
many
signs
and
portents
and
deaths
of
men
and
women
and
apparitions
of
ghosts
until
kjartan
thurida
son
brought
out
all
and

and
burned
them
