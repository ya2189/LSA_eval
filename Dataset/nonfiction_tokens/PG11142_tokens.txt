introduction
in
certain
quiet
nooks
of
old
england
and
by
contrast
in
some
of
the
busiest
centres
of
new
england
landmarks
of
religious
history
are
to
be
found
which
are
not
to
be
easily
understood
by
every
he
is
familiar
with
the
ordinary
places
of
worship
at
least
as
features
in
the
picture
of
town
or
village
here
is
the
parish
church
where
the
english
episcopal
order
has
succeeded
to
the
roman
yonder
is
the
more
modern
dissenting
chapel
homely
or
ornate
but
now
and
then
among
the
buildings
we
find
what
is
called
distinctively
a
house
or
more
briefly
a
which
may
perhaps
be
styled
or
its
architecture
usually
corresponds
with
the
simplicity
of
its
name
plain
almost
to
ugliness
yet
not
without
some
degree
of
severe
dignity
stand
these
old
structures
of
brick
occasionally
of
stone
bearing
the
mellowing
touch
of
time
surrounded
by
a
little
overshadowed
graveyard
they
often
add
a
peculiar
quaintness
and
solemnity
to
the
scene
gaskell
has
described
one
such
in
her
novel
and
admirers
of
her
art
should
know
well
that
her
own
grave
lies
beside
the
little
sanctuary
she
pictured
so
lovingly
sometimes
however
the
surroundings
of
the
ancient
chapel
are
less
attractive
it
stands
it
may
be
in
some
corner
or
court
of
a
town
or
city
whatever
picturesqueness
it
may
have
had
once
has
long
since
vanished
unlovely
decay
an
air
of
desolation
symptoms
of
neglect
present
a
mournful
sight
and
one
wonders
how
much
longer
the
poor
relic
will
remain
many
places
of
the
kind
have
already
been
swept
away
others
have
been
renovated
enlarged
and
kept
more
worthy
of
their
use
not
all
the
meeting
houses
are
of
one
kind
independents
baptists
and
friends
each
possess
some
of
them
now
and
again
the
tells
us
that
this
is
a
place
of
worship
but
a
loyal
scot
who
yearns
for
an
echo
of
the
kirk
would
be
greatly
surprised
on
finding
as
he
would
if
he
entered
that
the
doctrine
and
worship
there
is
not
calvinistic
in
any
shape
whatever
but
a
similar
surprise
awaits
the
visitor
to
new
england
it
may
be
even
a
greater
for
if
he
should
tread
in
the
footsteps
of
the
pilgrim
fathers
and
find
the
descendants
of
their
original
places
of
worship
at
plymouth
salem
or
boston
he
will
find
in
possession
so
it
is
in
many
of
the
oldest
towns
founded
by
the
american
colonists
of
the
seventeenth
century
in
their
centres
the
parish
churches
or
otherwise
stand
forth
challenging
everybody
attention
there
is
no
lack
of
here
nothing
at
all
like
the
shrinking
of
the
old
english
presbyterian
into
obscure
alleys
and
corners
spacious
well
appointed
and
secure
these
parish
churches
in
the
words
of
a
popular
unitarian
poet
the
whole
world
in
the
face
and
fear
not
any
man
the
object
of
the
present
brief
sketch
is
to
show
how
these
landmarks
have
come
to
be
where
they
are
to
trace
the
thoughts
and
fortunes
of
unitarians
from
their
rise
in
modern
times
to
indicate
their
religious
temper
and
practical
aims
and
to
exhibit
the
connections
of
the
unitarians
with
some
closely
approximating
groups
in
europe
and
asia
before
entering
upon
a
story
which
is
extremely
varied
and
comprehensive
one
or
two
important
points
must
be
emphasized
in
the
first
place
the
reader
must
bear
in
mind
that
the
term
is
one
of
popular
application
it
has
not
been
chosen
and
imposed
as
by
any
or
by
any
authoritative
assembly
there
has
never
been
a
leader
or
a
central
council
whose
decisions
on
these
matters
have
been
accepted
by
unitarians
as
final
even
when
most
closely
organized
they
have
steadily
resisted
all
attempts
so
to
fix
the
meaning
of
as
to
exclude
further
growth
of
opinion
consequently
there
is
always
room
for
variety
of
opinion
among
them
and
every
statement
of
their
principles
and
teachings
must
be
taken
as
a
sort
of
average
estimated
from
a
survey
more
or
less
extended
thus
the
significance
of
unitarianism
as
a
feature
of
modern
religious
development
can
not
be
grasped
apart
from
its
history
as
a
movement
of
thought
nowhere
is
it
more
necessary
than
here
to
reflect
that
to
know
what
a
thing
is
we
must
know
what
it
has
been
and
consider
what
its
future
naturally
involves
secondly
amid
all
the
varieties
of
thought
referred
to
complicated
as
they
are
by
the
eager
advance
of
some
and
the
clinging
to
survivals
by
others
there
are
two
notes
to
be
found
undeniably
if
unequally
characteristic
of
unitarianism
it
is
both
and
if
the
historian
seems
more
attentive
to
the
former
than
to
the
latter
this
must
not
be
taken
as
indicating
their
relative
importance
obviously
it
is
easier
to
record
controversies
than
to
unfold
the
wealth
of
profound
conceptions
perhaps
we
may
fairly
suggest
the
true
state
of
the
case
by
the
mere
juxtaposition
of
such
earlier
names
as
socinus
bidle
and
locke
with
those
of
channing
emerson
and
martineau
or
by
a
reference
to
the
earlier
unitarian
hymns
in
contrast
with
those
of
the
later
stages
some
terms
explained
a
brief
explanation
at
the
outset
may
help
the
reader
to
follow
more
intelligently
the
history
of
unitarianism
as
is
well
known
the
chief
issue
between
trinitarians
and
unitarians
arises
in
connection
with
the
relation
of
jesus
christ
to
god
questions
concerning
the
holy
spirit
being
usually
less
discussed
there
are
consequential
issues
also
bearing
upon
man
nature
atonement
salvation
and
other
subjects
but
these
call
for
no
remark
here
in
its
full
statement
as
given
for
instance
in
the
creed
the
trinitarian
dogma
presents
the
conception
of
three
in
one
god
father
son
and
holy
spirit
with
different
functions
but
all
equal
and
the
eastern
greek
orthodox
church
differs
from
the
western
roman
catholic
in
holding
that
the
third
person
from
the
father
alone
the
western
adds
from
the
son
the
full
dogma
as
given
in
the
creed
is
not
thought
to
be
earlier
than
the
fifth
century
debates
as
to
the
natures
in
christ
and
the
wills
and
other
abstruse
points
involved
in
the
dogma
continued
for
centuries
still
at
an
earlier
period
discussion
was
carried
on
as
to
whether
the
son
were
of
the
or
substance
with
the
father
the
latter
view
was
held
by
arius
and
his
party
at
the
council
of
nicaea
athanasius
held
the
former
view
which
in
time
but
only
after
many
years
of
controversial
strife
and
actual
warfare
became
established
as
orthodox
the
arians
regarded
the
son
as
a
subordinate
being
though
still
divine
another
variety
of
opinion
was
put
forth
by
sabellius
who
took
the
different
persons
to
be
so
many
diverse
modes
or
manifestations
of
the
one
god
this
sabellian
idea
though
officially
condemned
has
been
often
held
in
later
times
socinianism
so
far
as
regards
the
personality
and
rank
of
christ
differed
from
arianism
which
maintained
his
though
not
eternal
the
socinian
doctrine
being
that
the
man
jesus
was
raised
by
god
approving
benignity
to
rank
and
that
he
thus
became
a
fit
object
of
christian
the
humanitarian
view
finally
presented
jesus
as
a
man
a
being
not
essentially
different
in
his
nature
from
the
rest
of
humankind
modern
unitarianism
however
usually
avoids
this
kind
of
phrase
minds
said
channing
of
one
family
the
earlier
movement
in
england
i
the
unitarian
martyrs
the
rise
of
any
considerable
body
of
opinion
opposed
to
the
cardinal
dogma
of
orthodoxy
was
preceded
in
england
by
a
very
strongly
marked
effort
to
secure
liberty
of
thought
and
a
corresponding
plea
for
a
broadly
comprehensive
religious
fellowship
the
culmination
of
this
effort
is
reached
for
the
period
first
to
be
reviewed
in
the
writings
of
this
celebrated
man
by
his
powerful
arguments
for
religious
toleration
and
his
defence
of
the
of
the
christian
religion
exerted
an
influence
of
the
most
important
kind
but
we
must
reach
him
by
the
path
of
his
predecessors
in
the
same
line
the
principles
of
liberty
of
thought
and
the
broadest
religious
fellowship
are
warmly
espoused
by
unitarians
and
they
look
upon
all
who
have
advanced
these
principles
as
in
spirit
related
to
them
however
different
their
respective
theological
conclusions
may
have
been
at
the
time
of
the
reformation
a
great
deal
of
speculation
broke
forth
on
points
hitherto
closed
by
the
church
authority
including
the
fundamental
doctrine
of
the
trinity
but
while
this
new
ferment
led
to
departures
from
the
received
opinions
in
many
countries
especially
in
poland
and
the
netherlands
the
protestant
leaders
maintained
that
upon
the
great
articles
of
the
creeds
they
were
still
one
with
rome
and
in
fact
they
soon
displayed
an
eagerness
to
stifle
heresy
men
often
fail
to
see
the
logic
of
their
own
position
and
many
who
claimed
the
right
to
differ
from
rome
on
points
which
rome
considered
vital
were
unable
to
grant
that
others
had
an
equal
right
to
differ
from
luther
calvin
or
an
english
state
church
the
outrageous
cruelty
of
calvin
towards
the
whom
he
caused
to
be
burned
at
geneva
in
affords
a
glaring
instance
of
this
inconsistency
but
a
sad
proof
is
given
that
about
that
time
even
themselves
were
not
always
tolerant
among
the
countries
where
the
orthodox
dogma
was
most
freely
questioned
was
transylvania
adjacent
to
hungary
proper
here
the
sovereign
john
sigismund
took
sides
with
the
and
issued
in
an
edict
permitting
four
recognized
types
of
doctrine
and
worship
romanist
lutheran
calvinist
and
unitarian
the
transylvanians
were
at
this
time
largely
under
the
influence
of
their
polish
brethren
in
the
faith
who
still
practised
the
invocation
of
christ
a
powerful
religious
leader
in
hungary
having
arrived
at
a
view
of
christ
two
centuries
before
it
was
held
by
english
unitarians
opposed
in
when
a
catholic
had
succeeded
to
the
throne
david
was
denounced
for
an
intolerable
heretic
by
the
polish
party
and
being
imprisoned
died
the
same
year
this
blot
on
the
record
has
long
been
deplored
and
david
is
held
in
honour
as
a
martyr
by
the
transylvanian
unitarian
church
which
still
flourishes
and
forms
a
third
member
in
alliance
with
the
unitarians
of
great
britain
and
america
as
however
these
transylvanian
popularly
called
unitarians
had
until
the
nineteenth
century
little
or
no
connection
with
the
english
and
americans
and
have
not
materially
affected
the
development
of
the
movement
we
omit
the
details
of
their
special
history
in
england
a
number
of
suffered
burning
in
the
sixteenth
century
being
usually
but
loosely
described
as
the
last
two
in
england
who
died
by
fire
as
heretics
were
men
of
this
class
in
march
bartholomew
legate
was
burned
at
smithfield
and
a
month
later
edward
wightman
had
the
same
fate
at
lichfield
so
late
as
a
youth
named
pakenham
was
hanged
at
edinburgh
on
the
charge
of
heretical
blasphemy
although
these
were
the
only
executions
of
the
kind
here
in
the
seventeenth
century
the
evidence
is
but
too
clear
that
the
authorities
conceived
it
to
be
their
duty
to
put
down
this
form
of
opinion
with
the
severest
rigour
in
a
letter
sent
by
archbishop
neile
of
york
to
bishop
laud
in
reference
is
made
to
wightman
case
and
it
is
stated
that
another
man
one
trendall
deserves
the
same
sentence
a
few
years
later
paul
best
a
scholarly
gentleman
who
had
travelled
in
poland
and
transylvania
and
there
adopted
views
was
sentenced
by
vote
of
the
house
of
commons
to
be
hanged
for
denying
the
trinity
the
ordinance
drawn
up
in
by
the
puritan
authorities
was
incredibly
vindictive
against
what
they
judged
to
be
heretical
happily
oliver
cromwell
and
his
independents
were
conscious
of
considerable
variety
of
opinion
in
their
own
ranks
and
apparently
the
protector
secured
best
liberation
it
was
certainly
he
who
saved
another
and
more
memorable
unitarian
from
the
extreme
penalty
this
man
was
a
clergyman
and
schoolmaster
of
gloucester
his
biblical
studies
led
him
to
a
denial
of
the
trinity
which
he
lost
no
occasion
of
making
public
during
twenty
years
broken
by
five
or
six
imprisonments
he
persisted
in
the
effort
to
diffuse
unitarian
teachings
and
even
to
organize
services
for
unitarian
worship
his
writings
and
personal
influence
were
so
widely
recognized
that
it
became
a
fashion
later
to
speak
of
unitarians
as
cromwell
was
evidently
troubled
about
him
feeling
repugnance
to
his
doctrine
yet
averse
to
a
man
of
unblemished
character
in
ten
years
after
bidle
first
imprisonment
the
protector
sent
him
to
the
scilly
islands
obviously
to
spare
him
a
worse
fate
and
allowed
him
a
yearly
sum
for
maintenance
a
few
months
before
cromwell
death
he
was
brought
back
to
london
and
on
being
set
at
liberty
at
once
renewed
his
efforts
finally
he
was
caught
in
and
sent
to
gaol
and
in
september
of
that
year
he
died
ii
influences
making
for
the
foregoing
sufficiently
illustrates
the
position
confronting
those
who
at
that
time
openly
avowed
their
departure
from
the
trinitarian
dogma
those
who
dared
and
suffered
were
no
doubt
but
a
few
of
those
who
really
shared
in
the
heretical
view
the
testimony
of
orthodox
writers
is
all
in
support
of
this
surmise
equally
clear
is
the
fact
that
while
the
religious
authorities
were
thus
rigorous
a
steadily
deepening
undercurrent
of
opinion
made
for
how
far
this
latitude
might
properly
go
was
a
troublesome
question
but
at
any
rate
some
were
willing
to
advocate
what
many
must
have
silently
desired
apart
from
the
extremists
in
the
great
struggle
between
high
church
and
puritans
there
existed
a
group
of
moderate
men
often
of
shrewd
intellect
ripe
scholarship
and
attractive
temper
who
sought
in
a
wider
liberty
of
opinion
an
escape
from
the
tyrannical
alternatives
presented
by
the
two
opposing
parties
even
in
connection
with
these
very
parties
there
were
tendencies
peculiar
to
themselves
which
could
not
fail
in
the
end
to
mitigate
the
force
of
their
own
contentions
the
high
church
was
mostly
on
the
side
of
the
more
theology
of
that
age
the
puritans
were
wholly
committed
to
the
principle
of
democratic
liberty
as
then
understood
and
in
religious
matters
set
the
bible
in
the
highest
place
of
authority
it
could
not
be
but
that
these
several
factors
should
ultimately
tell
upon
the
solution
of
the
problem
of
religious
liberty
but
the
immediate
steps
toward
that
solution
had
to
be
taken
by
the
advocates
of
latitude
among
them
were
lord
falkland
john
hales
and
william
chillingworth
the
last
of
whom
is
famous
for
his
unflinching
protest
that
bible
the
bible
only
is
the
religion
of
protestants
a
saying
which
was
as
good
as
a
charter
to
those
who
based
their
heresies
on
the
explicit
words
of
scripture
in
the
second
half
of
that
seventeenth
century
the
work
of
broadening
the
religious
mind
was
carried
forward
by
others
of
equal
or
even
greater
ability
it
is
sufficient
here
to
name
jeremy
taylor
among
churchmen
and
richard
baxter
among
nonconformists
there
was
of
course
a
good
deal
of
levity
the
temper
of
the
gallio
who
cares
for
none
of
these
things
but
this
was
not
the
temper
of
the
men
to
whom
we
refer
their
greatest
difficulty
indeed
arose
from
their
intense
interest
in
religious
truth
they
could
not
conceive
a
state
which
should
not
control
men
theology
in
some
real
way
even
locke
did
not
advocate
toleration
for
the
atheist
for
such
a
man
in
his
opinion
could
not
make
the
solemn
asseverations
on
which
alone
civil
life
could
go
forward
nor
would
he
tolerate
the
roman
catholic
but
in
this
case
political
considerations
swayed
the
balance
the
catholic
introduced
the
fatal
principle
of
allegiance
to
a
prince
taking
for
granted
then
the
necessity
for
some
degree
of
state
supervision
of
religion
how
could
this
be
rendered
least
inimical
to
the
general
desire
for
liberty
the
reply
to
this
question
brought
them
very
close
to
the
position
taken
up
by
long
before
viz
that
the
of
a
christian
faith
should
be
recognized
as
few
and
as
far
as
possible
simple
of
course
it
is
from
his
name
that
the
term
is
derived
a
term
that
has
often
been
applied
but
mistakenly
to
unitarians
generally
the
repeated
and
often
bitter
accusation
brought
against
the
advocates
of
latitude
that
they
were
or
at
least
tainted
with
renders
appropriate
some
short
account
of
socinus
himself
this
man
was
one
of
the
italian
reformers
who
were
speedily
crushed
or
dispersed
by
the
vigilance
of
the
inquisition
those
who
escaped
wandered
far
and
some
were
at
different
times
members
of
the
church
for
or
foreigners
to
which
edward
vi
assigned
the
nave
of
the
great
augustine
church
still
standing
at
austin
friars
in
the
heart
of
the
city
of
london
it
is
interesting
to
observe
here
that
a
dutch
liberal
congregation
lineally
inherits
the
place
careful
investigation
has
shown
that
among
the
refugees
here
in
the
sixteenth
century
were
some
whose
opinions
were
unsound
on
the
trinity
possibly
they
affected
english
opinion
in
some
small
degree
uncle
of
was
for
a
short
time
in
london
but
interesting
thinker
as
he
was
his
nephew
who
never
set
foot
in
england
really
exerted
much
more
influence
upon
english
thought
it
was
however
in
poland
especially
that
the
influence
of
faustus
socinus
first
became
prominent
that
country
then
flourishing
under
its
own
princes
early
became
as
we
have
seen
the
home
of
an
form
of
protestantism
socinus
joined
this
group
and
during
the
latter
half
of
the
sixteenth
century
effected
much
improvement
among
them
organizing
their
congregations
establishing
schools
promoting
a
unitarian
literature
the
educational
work
thus
begun
achieved
great
success
but
in
his
own
lifetime
socinus
met
with
fierce
opposition
and
even
personal
violence
he
died
in
the
polish
unitarian
church
fell
under
the
persecution
of
both
catholics
and
orthodox
protestants
and
was
finally
crushed
out
in
important
for
our
present
study
is
the
fact
that
the
literary
output
of
these
polish
socinians
was
both
large
and
of
high
quality
their
catechism
was
translated
into
different
languages
and
early
found
its
way
into
england
james
i
promptly
had
it
burned
despite
the
fact
that
the
latin
version
was
dedicated
to
himself
other
books
and
pamphlets
followed
and
even
if
we
abate
something
as
due
to
the
exaggerating
fears
and
suspicions
of
the
authorities
there
would
seem
to
have
been
no
time
as
the
seventeenth
century
went
on
when
socinian
literature
was
not
widely
circulated
here
albeit
at
first
in
secret
into
the
details
of
this
literature
there
is
no
need
to
go
it
is
sufficient
to
observe
its
outstanding
features
they
correspond
in
the
main
to
the
temper
of
the
master
mind
socinus
a
man
who
in
the
absence
of
imaginative
genius
displayed
remarkable
talent
as
a
reasoner
and
a
liberal
disposition
considerably
in
advance
of
his
times
the
later
socinian
writings
preserved
in
eight
large
volumes
issued
by
the
brethren
amsterdam
exhibit
in
addition
the
results
of
much
diligent
research
and
scholarship
in
which
the
wide
variety
of
opinion
actually
held
by
the
fathers
and
later
church
authorities
is
proved
and
the
moral
is
drawn
in
the
presence
of
so
much
fluctuating
teaching
upon
the
abstruser
points
of
the
creeds
was
it
not
desirable
to
abandon
the
pretence
of
a
rounded
system
complete
in
every
detail
would
it
not
he
better
to
simplify
the
faith
in
other
and
familiar
words
to
reduce
the
number
of
in
order
to
discover
these
essentials
surely
the
inquirer
must
turn
to
the
bible
the
record
of
that
miraculous
revelation
which
was
given
to
deliver
man
unassisted
reason
from
the
perils
of
ignorance
and
doubt
at
the
same
time
reason
itself
was
a
divine
gift
and
the
bible
should
be
carefully
and
rationally
studied
in
order
to
gather
its
real
message
as
the
fruit
of
such
study
the
socinians
not
only
propounded
an
doctrine
derived
from
scripture
but
in
particular
emphasized
the
arguments
against
the
substitutionary
atonement
as
presented
in
the
popular
augustinian
scheme
and
philosophically
expounded
in
deus
socinus
himself
must
be
credited
with
whatever
force
belongs
to
these
criticisms
on
the
usual
doctrine
of
the
death
of
christ
and
it
may
be
fairly
said
that
most
of
the
objections
advanced
in
modern
works
on
that
subject
are
practically
identical
with
those
of
three
centuries
ago
now
there
is
good
reason
for
believing
that
towards
the
end
of
the
seventeenth
century
this
socinian
literature
really
attracted
much
attention
in
england
and
probably
with
considerable
effect
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
no
english
translation
of
any
part
of
it
was
made
before
john
bidle
propagandist
activity
in
the
middle
of
the
century
and
we
have
the
explicit
testimony
of
bidle
himself
and
most
of
the
earlier
unitarians
that
they
were
not
led
into
their
heresy
by
foreign
books
it
was
the
bible
alone
that
made
them
unorthodox
a
famous
illustration
of
this
is
the
case
of
in
a
of
his
was
found
in
a
state
office
at
westminster
and
two
years
later
it
was
published
under
the
editorship
of
sumner
afterwards
bishop
of
winchester
the
work
is
entitled
treatise
of
christian
it
was
a
late
study
by
the
poet
laboriously
comparing
texts
and
pondering
them
with
a
mind
prepared
to
receive
the
verdict
of
scripture
as
final
whether
in
agreement
with
orthodoxy
or
not
the
most
ardent
of
milton
admirers
and
even
the
most
eager
unitarian
must
find
the
book
a
trial
but
the
latter
can
at
least
claim
the
author
of
as
an
and
the
former
may
solace
himself
by
noticing
that
here
as
in
all
the
rest
milton
soul
apart
he
emphatically
denies
that
it
was
the
works
of
so
called
that
directed
and
influenced
his
mind
on
the
subject
we
may
notice
here
the
interesting
fact
that
another
great
mind
of
that
age
isaac
has
left
evidence
of
his
own
defection
from
the
orthodox
view
and
his
correspondent
whose
views
appear
to
have
been
even
more
decided
is
only
less
conspicuous
on
this
point
because
his
general
services
to
breadth
and
liberality
of
religious
fellowship
are
more
brilliantly
striking
locke
for
is
widely
recognized
as
the
deciding
influence
on
the
literary
side
which
secured
the
passage
of
the
toleration
act
in
deferring
for
the
moment
further
allusion
to
the
position
created
by
this
act
we
must
at
once
observe
the
scope
of
one
of
locke
works
which
is
not
so
popularly
known
this
is
his
of
which
with
his
rejoinders
to
critics
makes
a
considerable
bulk
in
his
writings
in
pursuance
of
the
aim
to
the
number
of
essentials
and
to
discover
that
in
the
christian
religion
which
is
available
for
simple
people
the
majority
of
mankind
locke
examines
the
historical
portion
of
the
new
testament
and
presents
the
result
practically
this
amounts
to
the
verdict
that
it
is
sufficient
for
the
christian
to
accept
the
messiahship
of
christ
and
to
submit
to
his
rule
of
conduct
the
orthodox
critics
complained
that
he
had
omitted
the
epistles
in
his
summary
of
doctrine
his
retort
is
obvious
if
the
gospels
lead
to
the
conclusion
just
stated
the
epistles
can
not
be
allowed
however
weighty
to
establish
a
contrary
one
of
course
locke
was
called
a
but
the
effect
of
his
work
remained
and
we
should
remark
that
if
it
looked
on
the
one
hand
toward
the
orthodox
on
the
other
it
looked
toward
the
sceptics
and
freethinkers
who
began
at
that
time
a
long
and
not
ineffectual
criticism
of
the
miraculous
claims
of
christianity
locke
endeavoured
to
convince
such
minds
that
christianity
was
in
reality
not
an
irrational
code
of
doctrines
but
a
truly
practical
scheme
of
life
in
this
endeavour
he
was
preceded
by
richard
baxter
who
had
written
on
the
of
infidelity
and
was
followed
during
the
eighteenth
century
by
many
who
in
the
old
dissenting
chapels
were
leading
the
way
towards
an
overt
unitarianism
iii
the
old
nonconformists
the
reader
must
be
reminded
here
of
a
few
salient
facts
in
the
religious
history
of
the
seventeenth
century
all
these
undercurrents
of
heterodox
thought
with
but
few
and
soon
repressed
public
manifestations
of
its
presence
were
obscured
by
the
massive
movement
in
church
and
state
during
the
commonwealth
the
episcopal
system
was
abolished
and
a
presbyterian
system
substituted
though
with
difficulty
and
at
best
imperfectly
after
the
restoration
of
charles
ii
the
act
of
uniformity
episcopacy
in
a
form
made
of
set
purpose
as
unacceptable
to
the
puritans
as
possible
thereupon
arose
the
rivalry
of
conformist
and
nonconformist
which
has
ever
since
existed
in
england
severely
repressive
measures
were
tried
but
failed
to
extinguish
nonconformity
it
stood
irreconcilable
outside
the
establishment
there
were
distinct
varieties
in
its
ranks
the
presbyterians
once
largely
dominant
were
gradually
overtaken
numerically
by
the
independents
perhaps
it
is
better
to
say
that
in
the
circumstances
of
exclusion
in
which
both
were
situated
and
the
impossibility
of
maintaining
a
presbyterian
order
and
organization
the
dividing
line
between
these
two
bodies
of
nonconformists
naturally
faded
out
there
was
little
if
anything
to
keep
them
apart
on
the
score
of
doctrine
and
in
time
the
presbyterians
certainly
exhibited
something
of
the
tendency
to
variety
of
opinion
which
had
always
marked
the
independents
besides
these
bodies
the
baptists
and
quakers
stand
out
amid
the
sects
comprised
in
nonconformity
in
both
of
these
there
were
distinct
signs
of
from
time
to
time
as
to
the
former
indeed
along
with
the
earlier
baptist
movements
in
england
and
on
the
continent
especially
in
the
netherlands
there
had
always
gone
a
streak
of
heresy
alarming
to
the
authorities
among
the
quakers
william
penn
is
specially
notable
in
connection
with
our
subject
in
he
was
imprisoned
for
publishing
sandy
foundation
in
which
sabellian
views
were
advocated
it
need
hardly
be
pointed
out
that
among
the
still
more
eccentric
movements
if
the
term
be
allowed
heterodoxy
as
to
the
trinity
was
easy
to
trace
when
the
toleration
act
was
passed
the
old
nonconformity
became
that
being
the
term
used
in
the
statute
itself
dissenters
were
now
granted
freedom
of
worship
and
preaching
but
only
on
condition
that
their
ministers
subscribed
to
the
doctrinal
articles
of
the
church
of
england
including
of
course
belief
in
the
trinity
unitarians
therefore
were
excluded
from
the
benefit
of
the
act
and
the
general
views
of
dissenters
upon
the
subject
are
clear
from
the
fact
that
they
took
special
care
to
have
unitarians
ruled
out
from
the
liberty
now
being
achieved
by
themselves
locke
and
other
liberal
men
evidently
regretted
this
limitation
but
the
time
was
not
ripe
and
in
fact
the
penal
law
against
unitarians
was
not
repealed
till
unluckily
too
for
the
unitarians
a
sharp
controversy
due
to
their
own
zeal
had
broken
out
at
the
very
time
that
the
toleration
act
was
shaping
and
as
this
had
other
important
results
we
must
give
some
attention
to
it
iv
the
there
are
six
volumes
containing
under
this
title
a
large
number
of
pamphlets
and
treatises
for
and
against
the
new
views
published
about
this
period
it
is
the
first
considerable
body
of
unitarian
literature
its
promoter
was
a
disciple
of
john
bidle
on
whose
behalf
he
interceded
with
oliver
cromwell
though
himself
but
a
youth
at
the
time
firmin
a
prosperous
citizen
of
london
counted
among
his
friends
men
of
the
highest
offices
in
the
church
some
of
whom
are
said
to
have
been
affected
with
his
type
of
thought
apart
from
his
unitarianism
he
is
remarkable
as
an
enlightened
philanthropist
of
great
breadth
of
sympathy
men
of
very
different
theological
bent
who
were
fain
to
seek
refuge
in
london
from
persecutions
abroad
were
aided
by
funds
raised
by
him
we
should
notice
also
that
ardent
as
he
was
in
diffusing
unitarian
teachings
he
had
no
wish
at
first
to
set
up
separate
unitarian
chapels
his
desire
was
that
the
national
church
should
include
thinkers
like
himself
we
are
thus
pointed
into
a
path
which
for
a
time
at
least
promised
more
for
unitarian
developments
than
anything
very
evident
in
the
dissenting
community
the
situation
is
aptly
illustrated
by
a
little
book
of
pages
which
is
included
in
the
first
volume
of
the
this
work
is
specially
noteworthy
as
one
of
the
first
english
books
to
use
the
name
though
the
use
is
here
so
free
and
without
apology
or
explanation
that
we
must
suppose
it
had
already
attained
a
certain
vogue
before
the
date
of
the
book
the
title
is
brief
history
of
the
unitarians
called
also
neither
author
nor
publisher
is
named
but
the
former
is
known
to
have
been
the
rev
stephen
nye
a
clergyman
whose
grandfather
philip
nye
was
noted
in
his
day
as
one
of
the
few
independents
in
the
westminster
assembly
stephen
nye
book
takes
the
form
of
four
letters
ostensibly
written
to
an
unnamed
correspondent
who
has
asked
for
an
account
of
the
unitarians
called
socinians
the
opening
letter
states
their
doctrine
after
the
model
of
socinus
god
is
one
person
not
three
the
lord
christ
is
the
servant
and
creature
of
god
also
the
of
god
because
he
was
begotten
on
the
blessed
mary
by
the
spirit
or
power
of
god
holy
ghost
or
spirit
according
to
them
is
the
power
and
inspiration
of
god
we
may
notice
here
that
bidle
otherwise
agreeing
with
socinus
regarded
the
holy
spirit
as
a
living
being
chief
among
angels
nye
writing
as
if
an
impartial
observer
presents
the
scripture
argument
in
support
of
the
doctrine
of
the
unitarians
says
he
have
so
related
as
not
to
judge
or
rail
of
their
persons
because
however
learned
and
reasonable
men
which
is
their
character
among
their
worst
adversaries
may
be
argued
out
of
their
errors
yet
few
will
be
swaggered
or
chode
out
of
them
he
traces
the
doctrine
to
the
earliest
christian
times
and
shows
the
stages
of
trinitarian
growth
incidentally
he
says
that
arian
doctrines
are
openly
professed
in
transylvania
and
in
some
churches
of
the
netherlands
and
adds
that
and
arian
churches
are
very
numerous
in
turkish
mahometan
and
pagan
dominions
where
liberty
of
conscience
is
allowed
he
mentions
celebrated
scholars
who
have
been
either
arians
or
socinians
or
great
favourers
of
them
such
as
erasmus
grotius
petavius
episcopius
and
sandius
the
a
learned
historian
who
had
made
a
special
point
of
collecting
admissions
by
orthodox
writers
of
the
invalidity
of
all
the
texts
in
turn
usually
quoted
in
support
of
the
trinity
in
the
subsequent
chapters
nye
deals
with
such
texts
and
the
book
ends
with
a
commendation
from
gentleman
a
person
of
excellent
learning
and
worth
to
whom
the
publisher
had
sent
it
for
remark
upon
such
levels
the
discussion
proceeded
the
skill
and
adroitness
of
the
heretics
contrasting
with
the
obvious
perplexity
of
the
orthodox
who
soon
fell
to
accusing
one
another
of
stumbling
into
erroneous
statements
dons
deans
and
even
bishops
joined
in
the
fray
and
some
of
them
notably
sherlock
master
of
the
temple
got
into
sad
trouble
with
their
brethren
finally
the
clergy
were
forbidden
to
prolong
the
discussion
which
indeed
promised
little
satisfaction
to
any
but
the
heretics
who
enjoyed
the
difficulties
of
the
orthodox
champions
the
traditional
formularies
were
there
and
these
must
suffice
in
the
presence
of
the
restrictions
imposed
by
the
toleration
act
speculation
outside
the
church
turned
towards
perhaps
the
best
modern
equivalent
would
be
religion
speculation
inside
the
church
had
to
accommodate
itself
to
the
creeds
and
articles
and
thus
there
grew
up
an
arianism
among
the
clergy
which
was
really
largely
diffused
and
produced
some
important
books
one
of
these
was
samuel
doctrine
of
the
a
work
which
appears
to
have
helped
many
a
clergyman
to
ease
his
conscience
while
reciting
the
authorized
trinitarian
expressions
though
in
substance
his
opinions
were
no
less
heretical
than
those
for
which
men
had
suffered
under
the
law
a
contemporary
case
of
such
suffering
was
that
of
an
irish
clergyman
who
was
sentenced
at
dublin
in
to
imprisonment
which
lasted
for
two
years
this
gross
treatment
excited
keen
criticism
at
home
and
in
the
american
colonies
whither
our
attention
must
soon
turn
emlyn
was
the
first
minister
to
call
himself
a
but
under
the
pressure
of
the
times
and
in
accordance
with
the
spirit
of
clarke
and
the
other
arianizing
clergy
he
found
it
expedient
to
declare
himself
a
scriptural
trinitarian
the
old
dissent
it
is
estimated
that
about
a
thousand
meeting
houses
were
erected
by
dissenters
in
the
twenty
years
following
the
passing
of
the
toleration
act
after
the
death
of
queen
anne
others
were
built
but
in
no
great
numbers
the
prevailing
impression
of
the
state
of
religion
in
england
during
the
first
half
of
the
eighteenth
century
is
a
gloomy
one
formalism
and
apparently
an
insincere
repetition
of
the
doctrinal
phrases
imposed
by
the
law
was
but
too
evident
in
the
state
church
dissent
had
its
bright
features
but
these
grew
dim
as
years
went
on
it
must
be
admitted
that
the
odds
were
heavy
against
that
party
without
conforming
no
one
could
be
appointed
to
public
office
and
the
conformity
of
sharing
the
communion
service
at
an
established
church
now
and
again
in
order
to
qualify
was
at
length
forbidden
by
the
act
of
the
sons
of
the
dissenting
gentry
and
manufacturers
were
excluded
from
the
universities
and
though
a
shift
was
made
by
here
and
there
the
excellence
of
the
education
they
might
impart
could
not
compensate
for
the
deprivation
of
the
social
advantages
of
oxford
and
cambridge
by
an
act
of
schools
for
more
than
a
rudimentary
education
were
forbidden
to
be
taught
by
dissenters
thus
we
are
not
surprised
to
hear
considerable
defection
went
on
and
early
in
the
century
congregations
began
to
dwindle
as
it
proceeded
some
became
very
small
indeed
and
many
died
out
altogether
the
trusts
upon
which
the
meeting
houses
were
founded
were
frequently
free
from
any
close
definitions
of
the
doctrines
supposed
to
be
held
by
the
congregation
much
discussion
arose
in
later
years
as
to
the
purport
of
this
freedom
perhaps
there
was
some
expectation
of
changing
opinion
in
the
future
but
more
probably
the
doctrinal
status
was
taken
for
granted
it
must
be
remembered
that
no
dissenting
preacher
could
legally
officiate
without
previously
to
the
doctrinal
articles
of
the
church
of
england
or
their
equivalents
in
the
westminster
catechisms
thus
while
the
dissenter
might
alter
the
terms
of
his
liturgy
to
a
degree
not
allowed
to
the
churchman
though
the
latter
would
in
those
lax
days
go
pretty
far
sometimes
he
was
still
supposed
to
be
on
the
fundamental
creeds
it
would
appear
to
be
a
fortunate
accident
for
unitarian
development
in
some
of
these
old
dissenting
congregations
that
either
the
prevalent
understanding
or
a
hope
for
speedy
inclusion
in
the
national
church
or
a
prevision
on
the
part
of
men
here
and
there
left
so
largely
undefined
the
basis
of
religious
union
among
them
as
congregations
however
that
may
be
it
is
certain
that
a
degree
of
reluctance
to
began
to
show
itself
and
this
we
surmise
was
often
due
to
other
reasons
than
liberality
pure
and
simple
that
there
were
men
who
while
conscientiously
orthodox
themselves
refused
to
exclude
unorthodox
ministers
from
their
fellowship
is
shown
by
a
notable
instance
among
the
baptists
before
matthew
caffyn
one
of
their
body
being
charged
with
opinions
was
still
retained
in
membership
by
vote
of
the
general
baptist
assembly
this
being
the
first
instance
of
any
organization
formal
acceptance
of
latitude
respecting
the
trinity
in
ireland
deterred
no
doubt
by
the
harsh
punishment
of
emlyn
there
was
natural
hesitation
in
avowing
such
latitude
but
in
a
division
began
in
ulster
between
those
who
insisted
on
the
creed
anew
and
those
who
opposed
and
a
few
years
later
the
being
excluded
from
the
synod
formed
a
new
presbytery
which
in
course
of
time
became
distinctly
unitarian
the
historic
event
for
english
was
a
declaration
made
at
a
meeting
of
dissenting
ministers
independents
baptists
and
presbyterians
held
in
at
salter
hall
london
certain
exeter
ministers
had
become
unsound
in
doctrine
and
refused
to
renew
their
subscription
to
the
creeds
and
articles
claiming
to
believe
scripture
a
expression
in
those
days
the
question
of
their
exclusion
was
referred
to
london
and
there
again
the
point
of
renewed
was
raised
before
the
vote
on
the
exeter
case
was
taken
by
to
it
was
decided
that
the
declaration
of
faith
should
be
confined
to
words
of
scripture
as
sir
joseph
jekyll
put
it
bible
carried
it
by
four
this
was
widely
recognized
as
setting
open
the
door
for
liberty
in
matters
of
religion
and
the
interesting
fact
should
be
recorded
that
independents
and
presbyterians
were
found
on
both
sides
here
then
we
may
for
the
present
leave
the
english
development
it
was
slow
tentative
for
the
most
part
obscure
in
one
direction
and
another
the
movement
of
thought
might
be
perceived
in
the
church
among
the
or
baptists
or
presbyterians
as
the
case
might
be
it
was
only
long
after
that
much
preponderance
of
heretical
opinion
was
distinctive
of
presbyterian
congregations
in
the
academies
men
like
the
hymn
writer
were
affording
room
at
least
for
ample
discussion
among
the
students
and
moderate
as
his
own
opinions
were
he
is
credited
with
having
made
a
byword
the
independents
caleb
fleming
and
led
the
way
to
views
the
latter
being
a
learned
writer
of
much
influence
it
is
said
that
another
great
hymn
writer
isaac
watts
finally
shared
the
humanitarian
view
on
the
whole
with
some
notable
exceptions
the
dissenting
preachers
seem
to
have
been
decorously
dull
and
uninspiringly
ethical
without
the
zeal
of
the
whom
they
severely
scanned
from
afar
and
seeking
in
all
things
to
prove
that
christianity
was
so
as
to
be
identical
with
philosophy
it
is
little
wonder
that
when
the
popular
mind
began
to
be
stirred
by
a
religious
they
were
not
its
apostles
but
mostly
its
critics
this
is
precisely
the
point
where
we
may
fitly
turn
to
consider
the
growth
of
unitarianism
in
new
england
new
england
i
before
the
as
in
the
old
country
so
in
the
colonies
of
north
america
a
great
evangelical
revival
took
place
towards
the
middle
of
the
eighteenth
century
john
wesley
the
arminian
and
george
whitefield
the
calvinist
were
the
great
apostles
of
this
movement
and
the
latter
especially
was
very
influential
in
america
the
english
revivalists
were
not
alone
however
among
the
most
powerful
leaders
in
the
colonies
was
jonathan
edwards
whose
name
ranks
very
high
in
the
records
of
religious
philosophy
in
the
states
despite
preliminary
obstacles
this
preacher
of
the
most
stern
and
unflinching
determinism
produced
a
quite
extraordinary
effect
at
last
as
usually
happens
his
dogmas
were
more
easily
repeated
by
others
than
his
reasoning
violent
excitement
ran
through
the
colonies
and
it
was
this
that
gave
a
decisive
turn
to
the
liberalism
which
ultimately
developed
into
a
very
memorable
phase
of
unitarianism
the
preceding
steps
may
be
briefly
indicated
a
familiar
epigram
preserves
the
acid
truth
that
the
puritan
emigrants
who
left
england
in
the
seventeenth
century
went
to
north
america
in
order
to
worship
god
in
their
own
way
and
to
compel
everyone
else
to
do
the
same
religious
liberty
was
certainly
not
understood
by
them
as
it
is
understood
the
sufferings
of
the
baptists
and
quakers
for
example
make
a
sad
chapter
of
new
england
history
about
the
middle
of
the
century
having
ventilated
opinions
contrary
to
the
general
calvinism
was
driven
out
of
salem
where
he
had
ministered
to
a
grateful
church
his
pleas
for
a
real
religious
freedom
were
in
vain
and
he
was
forced
to
wander
from
the
colonial
settlements
and
find
a
precarious
home
among
the
indians
after
much
privation
he
succeeded
in
establishing
a
new
colony
at
rhode
island
where
a
more
liberal
atmosphere
prevailed
it
does
not
appear
that
williams
had
much
influence
in
the
general
world
of
religious
thought
but
two
things
at
least
were
favourable
to
the
modification
of
orthodoxy
on
the
one
hand
there
was
inevitably
a
looser
system
of
supervision
in
a
new
country
and
the
pressure
of
penal
law
could
not
be
exerted
so
effectually
as
in
england
on
the
other
hand
the
organization
of
worship
and
teaching
though
intended
to
be
strict
and
complete
an
intention
fairly
successful
in
practice
was
actually
founded
upon
broad
principles
each
township
maintained
its
church
but
this
originally
of
a
low
church
or
type
was
usually
accommodated
as
years
went
on
to
a
congregational
model
these
churches
were
looked
upon
as
centres
of
religious
culture
for
the
respective
communities
by
whose
regular
contributions
they
were
supported
and
endowed
the
by
which
the
members
bound
themselves
were
often
expressed
in
terms
quite
simple
and
even
touching
the
colonists
were
in
the
main
faithful
to
the
parting
injunction
of
the
famous
pastor
john
robinson
who
sped
the
fathers
on
their
way
with
the
assurance
that
the
lord
had
light
and
truth
to
break
forth
from
his
holy
word
occasionally
it
is
expressly
declared
by
the
covenanting
members
that
theirs
is
an
attitude
of
devout
expectation
of
religious
growth
as
would
naturally
be
expected
the
conditions
of
the
earlier
generations
in
the
colonies
were
not
in
favour
of
a
deeply
studious
ministry
the
leaders
were
more
frequently
men
of
shrewd
and
practical
piety
than
profound
scholars
as
things
became
more
settled
and
especially
after
the
toleration
act
had
secured
a
more
assured
state
of
feeling
at
home
the
minds
of
men
were
set
at
liberty
in
a
greater
degree
locke
works
were
carried
across
the
sea
and
arianizing
writings
soon
followed
apparently
the
first
stir
of
any
importance
was
produced
by
the
scandal
of
the
punishment
of
thomas
emlyn
the
irish
clergyman
who
has
been
previously
referred
to
writings
received
a
great
advertisement
and
although
he
managed
like
clarke
to
avoid
further
legal
difficulties
by
publishing
a
statement
of
his
adherence
to
a
trinity
his
defection
from
the
orthodox
dogma
was
clear
enough
and
his
arguments
against
that
dogma
remained
another
case
which
was
notorious
in
those
days
was
that
of
the
translator
of
the
works
of
josephus
who
was
dismissed
from
his
professorship
at
cambridge
in
for
arianism
a
prolific
writer
and
a
shrewd
debater
whiston
played
no
small
part
in
the
general
leavening
of
opinion
but
probably
the
most
direct
of
the
literary
influences
in
this
direction
came
from
the
pen
of
john
one
of
the
most
able
and
learned
of
the
presbyterian
divines
his
treatises
on
and
the
dealt
with
subjects
of
the
profoundest
importance
in
relation
to
the
usual
trinitarian
scheme
of
doctrine
preferring
for
his
own
part
to
be
known
by
no
sectarian
name
but
to
be
reckoned
among
only
taylor
was
recognized
far
and
wide
as
a
writer
extremely
to
the
ordinary
type
of
belief
when
the
american
revivalists
were
at
their
height
there
were
many
quiet
and
staid
new
england
ministers
who
found
in
taylor
a
welcome
ally
against
the
extravagances
which
they
witnessed
and
deplored
the
more
logical
the
calvinist
was
the
more
vivid
in
depicting
the
horrors
of
predestined
damnation
the
more
vigorous
these
men
became
in
denouncing
such
a
doctrine
perhaps
the
growing
sense
of
individual
liberty
and
personal
rights
had
much
to
do
with
the
reaction
a
theory
based
upon
the
postulate
of
an
absolute
and
unconditioned
sovereignty
divine
did
not
accord
with
the
growing
democratic
temper
preachers
began
to
insist
and
hearers
to
agree
that
whatever
is
it
must
be
reasonable
if
reasonable
creatures
are
to
enjoy
its
benefits
here
also
as
among
the
english
the
conviction
grew
that
the
essentials
of
a
christian
belief
must
be
few
and
simple
and
these
such
as
plain
men
could
understand
and
discuss
and
here
as
among
the
sober
dissenters
at
home
men
looked
askance
on
unintelligent
outbursts
of
emotion
the
process
of
change
was
not
very
fast
and
a
good
many
who
were
sensible
of
change
in
their
opinions
were
reluctant
to
accept
new
doctrinal
designations
arians
they
might
be
but
they
preferred
to
be
known
as
standing
by
a
christianity
for
whatever
new
books
might
be
written
the
bible
remained
their
chief
study
and
their
support
in
discussion
keen
rational
rather
than
mystical
yet
deeply
interested
in
moral
progress
and
human
elevation
these
american
divines
were
much
of
a
mind
with
their
english
brethren
whose
path
lay
in
the
same
direction
one
of
the
most
influential
preachers
was
who
for
sixty
years
was
minister
at
the
church
boston
his
theology
was
arian
and
holding
the
doctrine
of
a
final
universal
salvation
his
came
out
forcibly
in
his
protests
against
the
revivalist
excesses
it
is
recorded
of
him
that
in
his
youth
disgusted
by
noisy
fanatics
he
prayed
god
never
to
make
him
an
orator
his
prayer
was
granted
and
still
he
was
a
power
ii
the
liberal
reaction
with
the
rise
of
the
new
liberalism
in
the
american
colonies
no
name
is
more
conspicuous
than
that
of
whose
eloquence
was
of
a
more
modern
type
than
most
of
his
day
he
is
credited
with
having
deeply
moved
many
who
became
leaders
in
turn
whether
as
ministers
or
laymen
after
the
interruption
of
normal
development
inevitable
during
the
war
of
independence
things
moved
more
rapidly
the
french
revolution
evoked
the
warmest
sympathy
in
the
united
states
and
its
effect
on
religion
there
was
largely
to
increase
a
sense
of
the
worth
of
man
the
final
restoration
of
all
became
a
conspicuous
doctrine
with
some
the
need
for
practical
measures
to
uplift
the
general
life
here
was
a
theme
more
to
the
mind
of
others
the
distinctly
trend
was
from
the
first
associated
with
this
eager
attention
to
the
higher
culture
harvard
college
in
the
very
heart
of
new
england
rapidly
developed
into
a
fruitful
source
of
the
newer
ideas
which
were
embodied
in
the
lives
of
merchants
physicians
lawyers
and
teachers
and
thus
the
community
in
all
its
more
vigorous
members
became
charged
with
a
fresh
conception
of
life
and
religion
in
the
first
decade
of
the
nineteenth
century
we
begin
to
trace
publications
more
or
less
distinctly
unitarian
one
of
these
was
the
the
pioneer
among
american
literary
magazines
one
of
its
two
editors
was
the
rev
william
emerson
father
of
ralph
waldo
emerson
as
the
divergence
of
ideas
grew
more
distinct
debate
began
to
be
fierce
the
new
magazine
took
a
bold
line
while
many
liberals
were
still
hesitating
in
the
trouble
came
to
the
surface
harvard
was
denounced
by
the
orthodox
party
in
consequence
of
the
appointment
of
a
liberal
minister
henry
ware
to
a
professorship
involving
pastoral
care
of
the
students
an
orthodox
rival
school
was
set
up
at
andover
a
few
years
later
a
pamphlet
appeared
giving
letters
alleged
to
have
been
sent
to
england
by
boston
ministers
reporting
that
a
certain
number
were
unitarians
the
name
was
unwelcome
at
the
time
especially
because
it
was
associated
with
the
then
becoming
widely
taught
in
england
the
implicated
ministers
being
charged
with
cowardly
evasion
replied
with
warmth
they
were
in
fact
mostly
arians
and
thus
their
views
really
were
different
from
the
english
type
moreover
again
in
contrast
with
the
english
they
expressed
strong
dislike
of
controversy
all
they
asked
was
to
be
left
alone
to
proclaim
the
christianity
in
which
they
believed
the
upshot
showed
however
that
controversy
was
not
to
be
avoided
and
during
twenty
years
from
onwards
it
raged
more
or
less
severely
an
epoch
in
this
long
and
regrettable
warfare
was
marked
by
a
sermon
preached
at
baltimore
in
the
preacher
was
one
of
the
most
famous
men
on
the
unitarian
roll
ellery
already
eminent
he
continued
to
hold
a
position
unique
in
the
religious
life
of
new
england
his
saintly
character
and
his
noble
if
simple
eloquence
made
him
a
leader
in
spite
of
himself
for
a
long
time
he
had
maintained
a
mediating
position
all
through
his
life
he
resolutely
disclaimed
sectarianism
but
in
after
years
of
discussion
it
was
obvious
that
for
good
or
evil
the
old
dogma
and
the
new
spirit
lay
far
apart
from
that
date
liberals
and
conservatives
in
the
old
congregational
system
of
new
england
were
divided
and
christianity
which
was
the
subject
of
channing
discourse
was
a
recognized
type
in
the
land
in
the
american
unitarian
association
was
founded
it
was
but
a
struggling
society
at
first
not
for
lack
of
sympathy
with
its
principle
but
because
many
unitarians
like
channing
so
strongly
disliked
the
notion
of
forming
a
new
sect
that
they
took
little
interest
in
methods
of
propagandism
common
to
most
religious
bodies
english
unitarianism
recognized
by
law
by
a
mere
coincidence
the
british
and
foreign
unitarian
association
was
founded
almost
on
the
same
day
in
as
the
american
unitarian
association
this
step
evidently
implies
a
great
change
in
unitarian
affairs
since
the
times
of
that
early
dissent
towards
which
attention
has
been
previously
directed
we
must
now
endeavour
to
trace
the
change
in
detail
it
will
be
remembered
that
tendencies
to
thought
using
that
term
to
cover
all
the
varieties
of
heretical
opinion
on
the
subject
were
manifested
both
within
the
established
church
and
without
as
regards
the
latter
phase
the
evidence
is
clear
that
whatever
the
doctrinal
was
worth
which
dissenting
preachers
had
to
make
there
was
a
decided
lapse
from
the
orthodox
standard
on
the
part
of
a
considerable
number
this
lapse
however
was
for
the
most
part
left
obscure
while
the
pulpits
resounded
with
moral
discourses
now
and
again
one
bolder
than
the
rest
ventured
to
discuss
controverted
points
of
doctrine
such
a
man
was
whose
career
is
interesting
as
an
illustration
of
the
growth
of
opinion
and
especially
important
in
regard
to
the
denominational
advance
of
unitarianism
he
began
life
as
a
calvinistic
independent
and
became
arminian
arian
and
humanitarian
in
turn
his
devotion
to
science
is
well
known
and
he
ranks
with
lavoisier
as
an
original
discoverer
of
oxygen
he
was
an
indefatigable
student
a
voluminous
writer
a
ready
controversialist
and
though
his
speaking
was
marred
by
imperfect
utterance
he
attained
to
considerable
influence
in
public
address
no
unitarian
leader
hitherto
has
displayed
more
activity
and
few
if
any
have
possessed
greater
controversial
ability
than
he
his
opinions
indeed
were
in
some
respects
peculiar
to
himself
he
called
himself
a
socinian
but
it
was
with
a
difference
and
no
unitarian
would
endorse
some
of
his
main
positions
but
his
work
for
the
cause
was
invaluable
and
his
personal
character
is
held
in
the
highest
esteem
originally
he
would
have
preferred
that
the
unitarians
should
remain
as
a
leaven
in
the
churches
eventually
he
became
the
chief
organizer
of
unitarian
worship
and
propaganda
the
first
church
however
was
due
to
a
clergyman
after
long
and
arduous
efforts
to
secure
relaxation
from
the
doctrinal
subscription
imposed
on
the
clergy
lindsey
resigned
his
living
at
catterick
in
facing
poverty
and
hardship
with
a
courage
that
elicited
warm
commendations
though
few
were
found
to
imitate
the
example
in
spite
of
the
terrors
of
the
law
now
becoming
a
dead
letter
he
opened
a
unitarian
chapel
in
essex
street
london
in
the
service
was
on
the
episcopal
model
but
with
a
liturgy
adapted
to
worship
of
the
father
only
this
feature
has
been
claimed
to
be
the
distinctive
characteristic
of
modern
unitarianism
it
will
be
remembered
that
socinus
inculcated
a
sort
of
subordinate
worship
of
christ
and
the
arians
of
course
held
to
the
same
practice
humanitarianism
the
view
that
jesus
christ
was
truly
a
man
and
in
no
sense
a
deity
obviously
made
it
impossible
to
offer
him
the
adoration
due
to
god
alone
this
view
had
been
slowly
spreading
since
the
days
of
lardner
priestley
lindsey
and
the
active
men
of
the
party
generally
shared
it
there
were
exceptions
still
however
richard
a
london
presbyterian
divine
of
great
eminence
remembered
as
one
of
the
founders
of
actuarial
science
held
by
his
arianism
to
the
last
this
did
not
prevent
him
from
lending
a
hand
in
the
organization
of
the
unitarian
forces
but
there
was
for
a
time
some
difficulty
on
the
subject
the
more
ardent
professors
of
the
new
doctrine
of
sole
worship
of
the
father
were
for
excluding
the
arians
from
fellowship
and
one
of
the
societies
then
formed
actually
adhered
to
a
rather
offensive
formula
on
the
subject
till
about
a
considerable
number
of
liberal
churchmen
of
the
laity
including
some
of
rank
supported
lindsey
movement
an
indication
of
changing
moods
is
given
in
the
fact
that
in
an
act
was
passed
permitting
the
dissenting
ministers
to
preach
provided
that
they
made
a
declaration
of
belief
in
the
scriptures
as
containing
the
revealed
will
of
god
this
was
considered
by
many
a
welcome
relief
from
the
requirement
of
the
toleration
act
that
the
minister
must
subscribe
to
the
doctrinal
articles
of
the
established
church
and
it
was
certainly
a
much
less
definite
test
priestley
for
his
part
however
regretted
the
change
the
old
subscription
was
in
reality
ceasing
to
be
enforced
and
he
was
afraid
lest
persecuting
vigilance
would
set
in
again
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
act
of
long
obsolete
has
never
been
repealed
but
very
few
people
are
aware
of
its
existence
priestley
many
controversies
tended
to
excite
a
good
deal
of
interest
some
of
it
more
than
unfriendly
in
the
new
movement
in
when
a
party
of
unitarians
dined
at
birmingham
in
celebration
of
the
french
revolution
serious
riots
broke
out
and
priestley
who
was
then
minister
of
the
new
meeting
there
was
made
a
principal
victim
though
he
was
not
one
of
the
diners
his
house
and
library
were
burned
and
he
barely
escaped
the
violence
of
the
mob
other
residences
were
also
destroyed
and
the
old
and
new
meetings
were
burnt
down
ultimately
in
priestley
sought
asylum
in
america
from
the
that
pursued
him
even
in
london
bishop
horsley
one
of
his
sturdiest
opponents
in
controversy
said
patriarch
of
the
sect
is
fled
it
was
earlier
in
the
same
year
that
the
first
organized
unitarian
propaganda
took
shape
in
a
society
for
promoting
christian
district
unions
were
soon
formed
and
in
a
unitarian
fund
was
raised
by
means
of
which
the
first
itinerant
missionary
of
the
body
was
sent
literally
from
end
to
end
of
great
britain
in
unitarians
were
set
free
from
legal
penalties
by
the
repeal
so
far
as
they
were
concerned
of
the
exceptive
clauses
of
the
toleration
act
this
relief
coming
twenty
years
after
charles
james
fox
had
tried
to
secure
it
for
them
the
member
who
was
successful
was
william
smith
who
sat
for
norwich
and
whose
granddaughter
was
florence
nightingale
in
an
association
was
founded
to
protect
and
extend
the
civil
rights
of
unitarians
it
was
by
combining
the
three
societies
the
society
for
promoting
christian
knowledge
the
fund
and
civil
rights
society
that
the
british
and
foreign
unitarian
association
was
formed
as
has
been
said
in
in
order
to
understand
fairly
the
scope
and
spirit
of
that
earlier
unitarian
period
thus
at
last
organized
in
full
legal
recognition
though
still
suffering
from
the
prejudice
inevitably
created
by
more
than
a
century
of
legal
condemnation
a
few
salient
points
should
be
kept
in
view
first
the
heterogeneous
elements
in
the
if
it
could
be
called
such
were
a
source
of
weakness
in
regard
to
united
action
instead
of
belonging
as
their
american
brethren
did
to
one
ecclesiastical
group
and
that
the
dominant
one
the
english
unitarians
included
dissenters
of
different
tendencies
and
traditions
with
a
few
recruits
from
the
state
church
the
congregations
as
they
were
not
very
strictly
called
were
the
backbone
of
the
many
of
these
however
were
very
weak
and
in
the
course
of
a
few
decades
some
were
destined
to
follow
those
which
had
died
out
in
the
eighteenth
century
converts
not
infrequently
lent
new
force
in
the
pulpit
but
at
the
risk
of
substituting
an
eager
missionary
spirit
for
the
usual
staid
decorum
of
the
old
families
in
these
the
ideals
of
breadth
simplicity
and
moral
excellence
were
stronger
than
the
desire
natural
in
a
convert
to
win
the
world
to
one
opinion
again
it
must
be
borne
in
mind
that
then
as
generally
there
were
men
whose
thoughts
ran
ahead
of
those
of
the
majority
priestley
for
example
while
adhering
to
the
idea
that
the
christian
revelation
had
been
guaranteed
by
miracles
had
abandoned
belief
in
the
virgin
birth
as
early
as
and
went
so
far
as
to
maintain
that
jesus
was
not
impeccable
and
had
certainly
entertained
erroneous
ideas
about
demoniacal
possession
probably
there
were
very
few
who
had
arrived
at
these
conclusions
even
thirty
years
later
some
unitarians
repudiated
them
at
a
much
later
period
the
miraculous
element
however
was
formerly
accepted
by
all
so
was
the
authority
of
scripture
though
here
again
men
like
priestley
were
ahead
of
the
rest
in
bringing
to
the
study
of
the
bible
the
principles
of
historical
criticism
a
typical
unitarian
scholar
and
divine
at
this
period
was
one
of
several
who
carried
forward
the
science
of
biblical
interpretation
and
by
the
use
of
a
vigorous
and
fearless
intellect
anticipated
views
of
genesis
and
the
pentateuch
which
did
not
find
general
acceptance
till
much
later
it
is
customary
for
unitarians
themselves
to
look
back
on
these
years
of
early
zeal
and
controversy
with
but
a
qualified
sympathy
so
much
was
still
cherished
in
the
body
as
a
whole
that
is
no
longer
tenable
and
again
so
much
that
was
undreamed
then
is
indispensable
to
modern
thought
one
of
the
greatest
of
unitarians
martineau
whose
important
share
in
the
development
of
their
ideas
and
life
must
be
considered
farther
on
referred
in
a
discourse
of
about
forty
years
ago
to
three
distinct
stages
in
unitarian
theology
first
he
pointed
to
the
significance
of
the
struggle
for
the
principle
of
in
the
divine
causation
as
against
a
doctrine
which
as
unitarians
maintain
endeavours
in
vain
by
words
to
prevent
a
triplicity
of
from
sliding
into
a
group
of
three
divine
beings
this
struggle
marks
in
great
part
the
whole
track
by
which
the
reader
has
come
thus
far
in
the
present
story
the
second
stage
according
to
martineau
is
that
in
which
the
conscience
of
man
is
emphasized
in
virtue
of
the
belief
in
a
real
responsibility
and
an
actual
power
to
choose
the
right
or
the
wrong
this
of
conscience
he
sees
especially
illustrated
in
the
principles
enunciated
and
the
work
accomplished
by
channing
perhaps
it
would
be
fair
to
say
that
many
who
had
preceded
the
american
leader
were
imbued
with
a
measure
of
his
wisdom
when
they
insisted
as
we
have
seen
on
the
adaptability
of
the
pure
gospel
message
to
the
needs
and
understanding
of
men
everywhere
and
declared
that
its
aim
was
make
men
good
and
keep
them
so
the
third
stage
which
martineau
considered
to
be
fully
begun
at
the
time
of
his
sermon
is
that
of
the
of
the
spirit
in
which
the
ideas
of
the
divine
sovereignty
and
the
human
duty
are
rounded
into
vital
beauty
and
completeness
by
the
idea
of
the
actual
relation
of
man
to
god
as
a
son
to
a
father
we
have
referred
in
advance
to
this
compendious
view
in
order
to
show
whither
the
sequel
is
to
lead
us
but
before
this
development
can
be
traced
there
remains
one
more
piece
of
external
history
to
be
supplied
happily
it
may
be
dealt
with
summarily
questions
of
inheritance
the
bitterness
of
theological
discussion
which
troubled
the
earlier
decades
of
the
nineteenth
century
received
new
provocation
in
the
shape
of
litigation
about
property
both
in
england
and
america
the
right
of
unitarianism
was
challenged
to
hold
those
meeting
houses
and
parish
churches
respectively
to
which
allusion
was
made
in
our
opening
pages
in
new
england
the
chief
matter
of
contention
was
settled
as
early
as
in
the
old
country
the
struggle
was
much
more
protracted
and
was
only
brought
to
an
end
by
special
legislation
in
the
american
dispute
may
be
briefly
stated
in
consequence
of
the
growing
and
unconcealed
departure
of
the
liberal
congregationalists
from
the
doctrinal
standards
of
the
past
there
arose
a
feeling
among
the
conservatives
that
the
former
group
should
go
out
of
fellowship
but
the
communal
conditions
of
the
parish
made
this
out
of
the
question
all
the
citizens
had
a
right
to
share
in
the
provision
for
religion
which
was
made
at
the
general
cost
an
acute
difficulty
however
presented
itself
in
regard
to
the
choice
of
minister
should
he
be
of
the
orthodox
or
the
heterodox
type
the
appointment
being
for
life
made
an
election
most
critical
an
incident
of
this
kind
occurred
at
dedham
and
coming
into
the
courts
led
to
a
decision
in
favour
of
the
liberals
of
the
the
case
was
argued
in
this
way
a
majority
of
members
on
the
register
being
in
favour
of
one
type
are
they
at
liberty
to
choose
as
they
will
or
have
the
citizens
at
large
being
contributories
to
the
maintenance
funds
a
right
to
vote
it
was
decided
by
the
courts
that
the
popular
right
was
valid
as
against
the
wishes
of
any
inner
and
covenanted
group
of
worshippers
this
meant
in
substance
that
orthodox
voters
were
outvoted
by
heterodox
voters
who
had
not
enrolled
themselves
by
a
religious
pledge
the
chagrin
of
the
defeated
conservatives
was
naturally
great
and
harsh
language
ensued
the
upshot
was
unaffected
of
course
and
time
alone
has
had
to
soften
the
angry
feelings
which
for
a
long
time
kept
the
two
wings
of
new
england
congregationalism
hostile
to
the
regret
of
good
men
on
each
side
in
recent
years
very
friendly
relationships
have
been
happily
set
up
while
the
unitarians
remain
undisputed
heirs
of
the
old
parish
churches
it
should
be
carefully
noted
however
that
in
the
communal
support
of
religion
was
abolished
and
all
religious
bodies
in
the
united
states
have
been
dependent
since
then
upon
private
resources
in
england
the
orthodox
opponents
of
unitarianism
tried
to
oust
the
heterodox
congregations
of
the
old
meeting
houses
a
suit
for
possession
of
endowment
funds
which
was
finally
decided
against
the
unitarians
of
wolverhampton
began
in
and
a
strongly
organized
attack
followed
in
a
rich
fund
for
ministerial
support
lady
hewley
charity
was
after
actions
carried
to
the
highest
court
declared
not
to
be
applicable
to
the
assistance
of
unitarians
this
decision
in
looked
like
the
beginning
of
the
end
for
the
tenure
of
the
meeting
houses
themselves
the
wolverhampton
case
being
now
decided
on
the
lines
of
the
hewley
judgment
but
an
act
of
parliament
the
chapels
passed
in
owing
in
some
part
to
the
powerful
support
of
gladstone
secured
the
congregations
in
undisturbed
possession
the
principle
of
this
law
applies
to
all
places
of
worship
held
upon
trusts
where
the
congregation
can
show
that
the
present
usage
agrees
substantially
with
that
of
the
past
years
it
is
not
to
be
ejected
at
the
time
of
this
litigation
the
term
presbyterian
came
much
into
vogue
among
unitarians
and
for
some
time
there
was
a
marked
abatement
of
propagandist
zeal
modern
unitarianism
i
the
communities
having
now
followed
the
fortunes
of
the
unitarians
up
to
the
point
where
they
obtained
a
recognized
position
among
religious
organizations
we
need
not
enter
into
the
minute
details
of
their
denominational
history
less
than
seventy
years
have
elapsed
since
the
passing
of
the
dissenters
chapels
act
and
less
than
a
century
since
the
judgment
in
the
dedham
case
the
congregational
increase
though
substantial
has
not
been
great
unitarians
claim
rather
to
have
influenced
the
advance
of
thought
in
other
denominations
than
to
have
created
one
more
sect
at
present
their
numerical
strength
may
be
estimated
from
the
following
particulars
in
the
british
isles
and
colonial
centres
there
are
nearly
four
hundred
places
of
worship
and
a
similar
number
of
ministers
in
many
cases
the
congregations
are
small
and
the
list
of
ministers
includes
some
that
are
retired
and
others
who
are
regarded
as
only
there
are
about
five
hundred
ministers
and
congregations
in
the
united
states
two
or
three
colleges
in
england
and
a
similar
number
in
america
train
students
for
the
ministry
but
many
join
the
ranks
from
other
denominations
women
are
eligible
as
ministers
but
actual
instances
are
rare
local
unions
exist
to
a
fairly
adequate
extent
in
england
and
america
national
conferences
meet
at
intervals
the
unitarian
associations
continuously
publish
literature
send
out
lecturers
and
promote
new
congregations
there
are
several
periodicals
the
most
noteworthy
in
england
is
the
which
follows
in
the
line
of
other
reviews
of
high
standard
in
past
years
and
which
specially
illustrates
the
spirit
animating
a
large
and
influential
section
of
the
body
it
is
promoted
for
free
and
open
intercourse
between
serious
thinkers
of
all
schools
of
theological
and
social
philosophy
and
is
reported
to
have
a
circulation
quite
beyond
that
of
any
similar
publication
the
lectures
connected
with
the
trust
founded
in
for
the
diffusion
of
in
its
simplest
and
most
intelligible
form
further
exemplify
the
broad
interpretation
of
this
duty
scholars
of
different
churches
have
contributed
to
the
series
of
volumes
well
known
to
religious
students
the
principle
followed
in
general
is
stated
in
the
phrase
learning
and
free
teaching
in
theology
it
is
needful
perhaps
to
guard
against
the
inference
that
the
unitarian
movement
is
only
or
in
the
main
an
intellectual
one
since
in
consequence
of
a
visit
by
joseph
from
boston
missions
were
founded
to
promote
the
religious
improvement
of
the
neglected
poor
and
this
kind
of
work
still
goes
on
with
much
social
benefit
in
our
larger
cities
similar
benevolence
has
marked
the
american
side
many
congregations
too
are
composed
largely
of
and
in
recent
years
a
van
mission
has
carried
the
unitarian
message
into
the
country
villages
mining
districts
and
other
populous
parts
these
aspects
of
their
activity
are
apt
to
be
obscured
owing
to
a
pardonable
disposition
of
unitarianism
to
point
to
the
names
associated
with
their
churches
in
the
american
list
for
example
we
find
emerson
longfellow
holmes
bryant
hawthorne
whittier
and
lowell
had
close
affinities
bancroft
motley
prescott
parkman
margaret
fuller
louisa
alcott
and
statesmen
jurists
merchants
and
scientists
too
numerous
to
set
down
here
obviously
the
english
side
can
not
rival
such
a
brilliant
roll
the
of
society
has
not
been
here
as
in
new
england
on
the
side
of
the
newer
theology
yet
english
unitarianism
has
its
eminent
names
also
alike
in
literature
science
politics
philanthropy
and
scholarship
of
various
kinds
and
the
body
is
credited
with
a
civic
strength
out
of
proportion
to
the
number
of
its
avowed
adherents
while
its
philanthropies
have
been
of
the
same
broad
and
enlightened
kind
as
those
which
enrich
the
american
record
ii
ideas
and
tendencies
more
important
to
the
general
public
is
the
question
of
ideas
which
now
prevail
among
unitarians
our
preceding
sketch
has
shown
some
of
the
results
of
the
freedom
claimed
by
them
in
one
generation
after
another
we
have
now
to
see
in
what
respects
the
nineteenth
century
effected
a
further
change
in
the
first
third
of
the
century
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
unitarians
adhered
tenaciously
but
with
discrimination
to
the
idea
of
the
final
authority
of
the
bible
in
this
respect
they
were
like
protestants
generally
and
though
they
nevertheless
brought
to
bear
on
their
reading
of
the
scriptures
other
protestants
did
the
same
if
to
a
less
degree
both
in
the
united
states
and
in
england
this
attitude
was
still
common
up
till
nearly
the
middle
of
the
century
and
instances
could
easily
be
found
later
still
the
miraculous
element
was
thus
retained
though
as
we
have
seen
as
early
as
in
priestley
case
there
was
a
tendency
to
eliminate
some
part
of
the
supernatural
that
a
thoroughgoing
belief
could
be
stated
in
good
round
terms
is
evident
from
the
following
sentence
taken
from
a
book
issued
by
orville
one
of
the
most
eloquent
pulpit
orators
of
his
day
the
book
is
entitled
its
date
is
referring
to
the
bible
the
author
says
is
it
for
us
that
the
matter
is
divine
the
doctrines
true
the
history
authentic
the
miracles
real
the
promises
glorious
the
threatenings
fearful
there
is
good
ground
for
taking
this
as
a
fair
example
of
the
ideas
prevalent
among
american
unitarians
at
that
time
perhaps
the
statement
was
made
the
more
emphatic
in
view
of
some
remarks
recently
uttered
by
two
young
men
whose
influence
along
with
more
general
tendencies
proved
fatal
to
the
old
doctrine
one
of
these
young
men
was
who
at
the
age
of
was
already
known
as
a
writer
and
preacher
far
above
the
average
he
was
then
resident
in
liverpool
where
he
wrote
a
remarkable
little
book
with
the
title
rationale
of
religious
more
than
fifty
years
later
he
published
an
even
more
remarkable
book
seat
of
authority
in
there
is
indeed
half
a
century
of
development
between
the
two
books
yet
the
germinal
thought
of
the
second
may
be
detected
in
the
first
the
point
at
issue
is
where
the
ultimate
appeal
should
lie
in
matters
of
religion
with
the
keen
eye
for
the
weaknesses
of
his
which
always
characterized
him
martineau
said
unitarian
takes
with
him
to
the
study
of
the
bible
the
persuasion
that
nothing
can
be
scriptural
which
is
not
rational
and
universal
this
fixed
opinion
which
he
ranks
along
with
the
foregone
conclusions
of
other
types
of
theologian
was
just
that
which
we
have
observed
in
the
general
course
of
liberals
from
locke
onwards
though
in
a
note
martineau
concedes
that
his
words
may
somewhat
strongly
accentuate
the
common
opinion
he
represents
unitarians
as
virtually
saying
we
could
find
the
doctrines
of
the
trinity
and
the
atonement
and
everlasting
torments
in
the
scriptures
we
should
believe
them
we
reject
them
not
because
we
deem
them
unreasonable
but
because
we
perceive
them
to
be
unscriptural
for
my
own
part
i
confess
myself
unable
to
adopt
this
language
not
he
says
but
that
he
does
think
them
actually
i
am
prepared
to
maintain
that
if
they
were
in
the
bible
they
would
still
be
incredible
reason
is
the
ultimate
appeal
the
supreme
tribunal
to
which
the
test
of
even
scripture
must
be
brought
it
abates
nothing
from
the
force
of
these
declarations
that
then
and
for
some
time
afterwards
martineau
himself
accepted
the
miracles
the
school
perceived
the
sharp
edge
of
such
a
weapon
and
its
wielder
was
during
many
years
regarded
as
a
innovator
the
other
young
writer
to
whom
reference
has
been
made
was
waldo
son
and
grandson
of
ministers
of
the
liberal
congregational
type
in
new
england
and
himself
for
a
short
time
minister
of
the
second
church
boston
preferring
the
freedom
of
the
lecturing
platform
emerson
had
already
withdrawn
from
the
ministry
but
in
he
gave
an
to
the
senior
class
in
the
divinity
school
harvard
which
proved
a
second
landmark
in
the
history
of
american
unitarianism
nineteen
years
before
channing
had
decisively
pointed
out
that
unitarianism
and
orthodoxy
are
two
distinct
theologies
in
the
divinity
school
address
emerson
maintained
that
the
idea
of
is
rendered
obsolete
by
a
recognition
of
the
reality
of
things
bringing
a
gift
of
pungent
prose
to
the
service
of
a
poetic
imagination
emerson
startled
the
decorously
dignified
authorities
of
the
new
england
pulpit
he
us
says
lowell
the
body
of
this
death
he
pointed
from
the
record
of
miracles
past
to
an
miracle
to
the
illumination
of
which
unitarians
had
followed
so
loyally
within
the
proviso
of
a
special
revelation
he
brought
the
light
of
a
mystic
intuition
some
of
his
elders
judged
it
to
be
fire
perilously
akin
to
the
which
their
predecessors
had
so
often
condemned
in
daring
simplicity
he
urged
that
there
had
been
exaggeration
about
the
of
jesus
soul
knows
no
persons
the
divine
is
always
latent
in
the
human
revelation
is
not
ended
as
if
god
were
dead
the
shock
to
the
minds
was
immense
long
and
debate
followed
though
emerson
with
provoking
declined
to
argue
he
simply
this
oracular
attitude
certainly
affected
some
of
the
younger
men
greatly
but
fortunately
for
the
success
of
the
new
gospel
one
of
these
younger
men
translated
the
oracular
into
a
more
popular
and
reasoned
form
three
years
after
emerson
address
completed
the
unitarian
trilogy
by
a
sermon
on
transient
and
the
permanent
in
it
may
be
said
to
have
done
for
emerson
message
the
kind
of
service
rendered
by
huxley
to
darwin
parker
at
once
became
a
marked
man
most
unitarian
pulpits
were
closed
against
him
but
a
large
hall
accommodated
the
vast
crowds
that
came
to
hear
him
it
is
doubtful
if
such
numerous
congregations
ever
listened
to
a
unitarian
before
or
since
he
continued
an
arduous
work
for
some
fifteen
years
but
it
wore
him
out
before
his
time
he
was
an
erudite
scholar
and
a
prolific
writer
discarding
the
claims
of
christianity
to
be
the
only
revelation
he
based
his
clear
and
always
optimistic
theism
on
the
broad
facts
of
human
experience
ardently
interested
in
social
and
political
questions
he
poured
satire
without
stint
on
the
religious
defenders
of
slavery
and
himself
dared
all
risks
along
with
the
foremost
abolitionists
such
a
man
could
not
but
count
for
much
and
though
his
radical
views
in
theology
greatly
disturbed
for
many
years
the
conservatives
in
the
body
for
unitarianism
itself
had
by
this
time
a
conservative
type
they
could
not
fail
to
permeate
the
minds
of
the
masses
of
emerson
own
this
is
hardly
the
place
to
speak
at
large
but
in
connection
with
the
development
of
that
of
the
in
which
martineau
sees
the
culmination
of
the
theological
progress
of
unitarianism
emerson
share
must
be
allowed
to
be
a
large
one
when
dean
stanley
visited
america
he
is
said
to
have
reported
that
he
had
heard
sermons
from
many
pulpits
but
was
the
one
preacher
in
them
all
it
is
certain
that
at
one
time
the
style
if
not
also
the
thought
of
emerson
was
extensively
copied
by
the
preachers
not
always
to
the
gain
of
solidity
a
degree
of
jauntiness
appears
in
the
worse
specimens
of
these
imitations
and
lord
morley
criticism
that
emerson
himself
was
too
oblivious
of
the
dark
side
of
human
suffering
and
guilt
would
doubtless
apply
to
much
of
the
unitarian
eloquence
at
one
time
inspired
by
his
witching
voice
this
however
is
but
one
side
of
the
american
message
in
the
nineteenth
century
evidence
abounds
that
a
type
of
teaching
with
adhesion
to
much
of
old
material
of
the
gospels
held
its
own
till
a
generation
ago
and
its
peculiar
accent
is
not
without
echoes
on
the
whole
it
is
probable
that
as
at
the
beginning
of
the
century
the
in
new
england
congregationalism
were
somewhat
shocked
at
some
of
the
daring
views
of
the
priestleyan
unitarians
in
england
so
even
towards
its
close
the
general
position
of
thought
was
more
conservative
there
than
was
the
rule
here
certainly
also
there
was
a
deep
tender
tone
manifested
even
where
opinion
was
most
radical
among
the
american
unitarians
and
of
this
no
better
proof
can
be
cited
than
the
large
number
of
hymns
of
a
high
order
both
of
thought
and
expression
which
have
been
written
among
them
they
serve
to
show
that
a
frank
acceptance
of
the
evolutionary
philosophy
by
no
means
necessarily
entails
the
decay
of
devout
personal
piety
or
the
loss
of
beautiful
ideals
among
the
american
hymnists
the
following
are
specially
eminent
and
their
productions
are
often
to
be
found
in
collections
brother
to
and
on
the
english
side
other
sweet
singers
have
appeared
my
god
to
thee
by
flower
is
a
hymn
and
if
the
names
of
channing
emerson
and
parker
can
not
be
equally
matched
here
in
their
several
spheres
there
has
been
no
lack
of
able
and
scholarly
representatives
and
one
name
at
least
is
of
universal
reputation
that
name
of
course
is
the
effective
changes
from
the
old
unitarianism
to
the
modern
type
are
best
displayed
in
the
story
of
his
long
life
and
the
monumental
books
which
bear
his
name
reference
has
been
made
to
his
early
brilliance
its
promise
was
amply
fulfilled
in
the
course
of
a
career
more
than
usually
prolonged
the
note
of
original
thought
sounded
in
the
see
was
to
be
heard
again
and
again
in
other
and
more
permanent
utterances
and
not
seldom
to
the
perplexity
and
dismay
of
many
of
his
unitarian
brethren
alike
in
religious
philosophy
in
attitude
to
the
scriptures
and
in
matters
of
church
organization
he
found
himself
from
time
to
time
at
variance
with
most
of
those
close
around
him
his
philosophical
and
critical
influence
was
in
large
measure
victorious
in
regard
to
organization
the
results
were
less
satisfactory
to
himself
it
will
be
instructive
to
observe
his
progress
third
paragraph
of
modern
unitarianism
ii
ideas
and
tendencies
as
regards
philosophy
it
is
necessary
to
remember
the
influence
of
priestley
and
belsham
these
unitarian
leaders
following
psychology
stood
for
a
which
was
complete
god
was
the
great
cause
of
all
not
the
cause
of
the
deistic
conception
operative
only
at
the
beginning
of
the
chain
of
events
and
now
remote
from
man
and
the
world
but
present
and
immediate
exhibiting
his
divine
purposes
in
all
the
beings
created
by
him
christianity
in
the
view
of
this
school
was
the
means
by
which
god
had
been
pleased
to
make
known
the
grand
consummation
of
this
life
in
a
perfected
life
to
come
jesus
the
messiah
was
the
chosen
revealer
of
the
divine
will
and
his
resurrection
was
the
supreme
and
necessary
guarantee
that
his
message
was
true
martineau
like
the
rest
of
his
generation
was
brought
up
in
this
necessarianism
but
its
tendency
as
he
reviewed
and
tested
it
was
to
do
violence
to
certain
irrepressible
factors
of
the
spiritual
life
it
is
only
fair
to
say
there
was
even
in
this
priestleyan
school
room
for
a
mystical
mood
but
on
the
whole
it
appeared
dry
and
intellectual
lacking
the
warm
and
operative
forces
of
a
deeper
devotion
it
is
interesting
to
find
that
martineau
himself
confessed
that
the
freshening
touch
upon
his
own
inner
life
came
in
a
closer
contact
with
evangelical
piety
his
mind
was
to
the
end
of
his
many
years
readily
responsive
to
congenial
impulses
let
them
come
whence
they
would
and
no
small
part
of
his
service
to
unitarianism
consists
in
the
broader
sympathies
which
he
generated
in
its
circles
to
channing
also
he
expressed
gratitude
for
helping
to
wake
in
him
a
new
sense
of
the
meaning
of
life
and
religion
it
was
channing
characteristic
to
insist
on
the
significance
of
personality
the
worth
the
depth
and
also
the
rights
of
the
human
made
so
vivid
an
appeal
to
his
mind
as
to
react
on
his
conceptions
of
the
divine
within
a
few
years
after
the
was
published
martineau
is
found
making
an
obvious
change
of
base
he
has
realized
that
the
externally
communicated
religion
of
the
old
school
however
sublime
in
its
proportions
fails
to
meet
the
needs
or
indeed
to
fit
the
facts
of
the
inner
life
man
personality
rises
in
his
thought
into
touch
with
god
the
revelation
from
without
can
only
be
recognized
as
such
by
the
aid
of
a
revelation
within
a
real
activity
a
genuine
moral
choice
and
a
resulting
character
the
marks
of
a
truly
living
soul
these
are
indispensable
to
an
adequate
view
of
the
religious
life
but
all
this
involves
two
significant
positions
each
far
asunder
from
those
hitherto
put
forth
there
must
be
freedom
at
least
in
the
moral
world
and
the
divine
assurances
of
moral
values
and
of
loving
aid
to
win
them
are
no
longer
confined
to
an
outer
record
such
a
record
may
yield
invaluable
service
as
a
heightener
and
interpreter
of
individual
experience
to
the
last
we
find
martineau
attaching
a
profound
and
quite
special
significance
to
the
revelation
in
jesus
of
the
life
of
sonship
to
god
and
retaining
tenaciously
the
christian
attitude
in
preference
to
one
of
simple
theism
but
his
system
is

and

with

the
influence
of

and
the
german
philosophy
what
is
called
flourished
midway
in
the
century
and
there
as
well
as
in
england
its
extravagances
were
deplored
martineau
himself
while
approaching
so
nearly
to
the
egoistic
centre
was
safeguarded
from
all
such
vagaries
by
an
sense
of
duty
in
his
volumes
of
sermon
the
after
the
christian
and
of
thought
on
sacred
which
remain
among
the
choicest
of
their
kind
in
our
language
his
austerity
of
moral
tone
is
only
relieved
by
an
elevation
of
poetic
mysticism
till
then
unknown
in
unitarian
literature
it
was
indeed
his
conviction
that
the
body
would
not
write
poetry
for
a
generation
or
two
so
dry
and
prosaic
did
he
find
it
but
at
that
very
time
his
own
efforts
in
hymnody
on
one
side
and
on
the
other
his
lyric
prose
almost
too
richly
ornate
for
general
wear
were
touching
new
springs
of
feeling
by
and
by
he
issued
in
conjunction
with
others
a
set
of
liturgical
services
which
did
much
to
lend
dignity
to
congregational
worship
and
what
gave
unique
influence
to
his
ideas
was
his
intimate
connection
from
to
with
college
london
one
of
the
successors
to
the
old
now
after
its
several
migrations
handsomely
housed
at
oxford
at
this
college
as
professor
of
mental
and
moral
philosophy
and
for
many
years
as
principal
he
made
a
deep
and
lasting
impression
on
the
minds
of
most
of
the
leading
scholars
and
preachers
his
great
works
of
ethical
and
study
of
gathered
up
the
harvest
of
long
study
and
exposition
in
these
subjects
and
are
the
most
important
of
their
kind
given
by
unitarians
to
the
world
in
accordance
with
what
has
been
indicated
the
later
attitude
of
martineau
and
naturally
of
his
pupils
though
the
principle
of
free
and
independent
judgment
is
and
always
has
been
insisted
upon
has
been
radical
in
respect
to
biblical
and
especially
to
new
testament
studies
an
influence
in
this
department
more
direct
than
his
own
was
formerly
found
in
the
writings
and
lectures
of
james
his
predecessor
as
principal
this
ripe
and
fearless
scholar
brought
home
to
unitarians
the
wealth
of
continental
literature
on
the
subject
the
school
stood
aghast
as
the
tide
of
criticism
overflowed
the
old
landmarks
of
thought
and
when
tayler
himself
issued
a
work
strongly
adverse
to
the
apostolic
authorship
of
the
fourth
gospel
distress
was
extreme
in
these
matters
however
the
tide
proved
irresistible
and
the
next
generation
of
preachers
and
students
were
among
the
most
ardent
translators
and
popularizers
of
the
new
views
of
jewish
and
christian
origins
the
character
of
the
pulpits
has
made
the
way
easier
than
in
most
other
denominations
for
the
incoming
of
modern
thought
in
this
and
other
directions
the
influence
of
natural
science
upon
the
trend
of
unitarian
opinion
has
hardly
been
second
to
that
of
biblical
criticism
some
names
in
the
list
of
prominent
unitarians
are
celebrated
in
this
connection
for
example
on
the
american
side
charles
and
on
the
english
side
a
son
of
the
last
named
estlin
a
man
of
wide
and
varied
scholarship
is
now
principal
of
manchester
college
a
field
in
which
he
is
specially
expert
is
that
of
comparative
religion
and
here
also
is
a
source
of
many
considerations
that
have
transformed
unitarianism
into
one
of
the
most
liberal
types
of
thought
in
the
modern
religious
world
it
is
not
to
be
inferred
however
that
the
tendencies
while
predominant
have
everywhere
prevailed
among
unitarians
the
side
continued
in
the
third
quarter
of
the
nineteenth
century
to
yield
important
signs
of
its
existence
and
fruitfulness
and
its
vitality
is
far
from
exhausted
still
the
miraculous
element
has
even
here
been
reduced
to
a
minimum
but
it
has
left
a
tinge
on
the
picture
of
jesus
which
fills
the
imagination
and
kindles
the
reverent
affection
of
many
among
the
more
gifted
representatives
of
this
school
we
may
name
the
americans
and
freeman
and
the
english
hamilton
thom
sermons
are
ranked
among
the
highest
for
spirituality
and
penetration
they
certainly
had
profound
effect
in
stimulating
the
wise
and
generous
philanthropy
of
and
henry
a
celebrated
representative
of
this
side
of
unitarianism
is
james
still
living
the
author
of
several
works
of
european
repute
among
new
testament
scholars
one
being
a
defence
of
the
johannine
authorship
of
the
fourth
gospel
he
succeeded
martineau
as
principal
of
manchester
college
his
volume
of
christian
is
the
most
important
statement
of
the
unitarian
view
published
in
recent
years
as
time
went
on
it
fell
to
martineau
and
other
leading
unitarians
to
take
up
a
defensive
attitude
against
the
extreme
forces
of
negation
in
particular
he
came
to
be
recognized
as
a
champion
of
theism
against
materialist
evolution
four
volumes
of
contain
some
of
his
acutest
writings
on
the
subject
an
address
presented
to
him
on
his
birthday
celebrated
his
eminence
in
this
and
other
ways
it
bore
the
signatures
of
six
hundred
and
fifty
of
the
most
brilliant
of
his
contemporaries
at
their
head
being
tennyson
and
browning
all
this
strenuous
progress
however
was
for
martineau
dogged
by
a
shadow
of
peculiar
disappointment
in
youth
he
was
as
ardent
a
as
any
but
about
the
time
of
the
dissenters
chapels
act
he
and
tayler
and
some
others
felt
increasing
dissatisfaction
with
the
tendency
of
the
more
active
unitarians
to
degenerate
into
a
sect
as
we
have
seen
the
same
divergence
of
feeling
arose
in
america
and
channing
always
strove
to
keep
unitarianism
there
from
succumbing
to
denominationalism
the
ardour
of
those
especially
who
had
newly
espoused
the
unitarian
view
and
found
it
precious
to
themselves
may
be
easily
understood
and
they
might
be
forgiven
some
impatience
with
the
apparent
apathy
of
those
who
had
no
great
desire
to
multiply
proselytes
some
of
these
eager
spirits
strove
to
rescue
the
body
from
what
they
evidently
regarded
as
a
paralysing
indefiniteness
from
time
to
time
it
was
argued
that
unitarianism
must
be
authoritatively
then
and
then
only
might
a
triumphant
progress
be
secured
mixed
with
such
notions
was
apparently
a
desire
to
keep
the
imprudent
and
men
from
going
far
in
one
form
or
other
this
opposition
has
persisted
till
the
present
but
its
acrimony
has
sensibly
lessened
as
on
the
one
hand
the
workers
have
more
fully
accepted
the
principle
of
unfettered
inquiry
and
on
the
other
the
lessons
of
experience
have
shown
that
however
eager
the
unitarians
may
be
for
the
widest
possible
religious
fellowship
they
are
in
fact
steadily
left
to
themselves
by
most
of
the
other
religious
bodies
especially
in
this
country
martineau
himself
about
forty
years
ago
tried
to
form
along
with
tayler
a
christian
union
which
should
ignore
dogmatic
considerations
but
tayler
died
and
so
little
encouragement
was
met
with
outside
the
unitarian
circle
that
the
thing
dropped
after
two
years
nearly
twenty
years
later
at
the
triennial
conference
held
in
at
leeds
a
remarkable
address
was
given
by
the
now
venerable
whom
as
he
mournfully
said
no
one
would
follow
in
favour
of
setting
up
again
an
english
presbyterian
system
which
should
swallow
up
all
the
many
designations
and
varieties
of
association
hitherto
prevailing
among
unitarians
the
proposal
was
considered
impracticable
and
the
dream
of
a
which
should
embrace
all
who
espoused
the
free
religious
position
whatever
their
doctrines
seemed
farther
than
ever
from
fulfilment
in
later
years
the
idea
has
however
continued
to
be
mooted
and
some
unitarians
hope
still
to
see
the
development
of
a
catholicism
in
which
the
traditional
distinction
between
unitarian
and
trinitarian
will
be
lost
meanwhile
as
has
been
said
the
extension
of
unitarian
worship
and
the
diffusion
of
literature
goes
on
with
a
fair
amount
of
success
in
america
thanks
largely
to
the
sagacious
toil
of
a
remarkable
organizer
the
unitarian
association
has
proved
a
strong
and
effective
instrument
for
this
purpose
and
the
british
association
whose
headquarters
are
now
in
the
building
where
lindsey
opened
the
first
unitarian
church
in
has
also
thriven
considerably
in
recent
years
it
is
said
that
the
rate
of
growth
in
the
number
of
congregations
in
the
united
kingdom
has
been
about
per
cent
during
the
past
in
america
the
rate
is
somewhat
higher
iii
methods
and
teachings
it
will
not
be
surprising
to
the
reader
to
learn
that
a
religious
body
having
such
a
past
and
being
so
variously
recruited
is
far
from
stereotyped
in
method
at
the
same
time
there
is
practical
agreement
on
the
main
lines
of
doctrine
in
worship
different
forms
are
used
many
churches
have
liturgies
adopted
at
discretion
and
usually
supplemented
by
free
prayer
in
others
the
free
service
alone
is
preferred
lessons
are
chiefly
taken
from
the
bible
but
selections
are
sometimes
read
from
other
devotional
literature
several
hymnals
have
wide
acceptance
a
few
are
peculiar
to
single
congregations
the
large
majority
of
sermons
are
read
though
extempore
address
is
now
less
infrequent
than
formerly
are
not
considered
indispensable
but
the
lord
supper
is
retained
in
many
cases
and
is
regarded
as
a
memorial
the
baptism
or
of
infants
is
also
practised
ministerial
ordination
is
not
considered
as
imparting
supernatural
gifts
but
as
a
solemnity
marking
the
entrance
of
the
accredited
person
into
full
recognition
and
office
the
congregation
makes
its
own
choice
of
a
minister
though
in
case
of
its
dependence
upon
outside
financial
assistance
the
advice
of
the
managers
of
the
fund
may
be
offered
the
support
of
the
churches
and
is
generally
by
voluntary
contributions
endowments
exist
in
some
instances
church
membership
is
usually
granted
without
insistence
upon
any
religious
declaration
new
buildings
are
invariably
associated
with
the
trust
principle
the
way
being
thus
left
open
for
such
changes
in
worship
and
opinion
as
may
hereafter
seem
right
some
churches
decline
to
be
known
as
and
where
that
name
is
adopted
it
is
usual
to
find
with
it
the
explanation
that
this
does
not
pledge
or
limit
future
development
or
bar
the
widest
religious
sympathy
in
the
present
reference
has
been
made
to
in
this
field
unitarians
have
always
been
pioneers
and
their
aims
have
usually
been
to
promote
culture
without
sectarian
zeal
many
large
schools
continue
as
in
the
past
to
form
centres
of
education
of
the
widest
type
not
only
to
children
but
adults
much
interest
is
taken
in
social
amelioration
some
observers
have
asserted
that
this
interest
is
more
vivid
in
many
quarters
than
any
in
matters
theological
or
philosophical
statements
of
the
teachings
usually
accepted
in
the
churches
are
numerous
one
here
quoted
will
fairly
represent
the
general
type
it
was
drawn
up
by
acland
an
eager
social
reformer
a
powerful
preacher
and
author
and
memorable
especially
as
a
popularizer
of
martineau
religious
philosophy
of
course
from
what
has
been
already
said
such
a
statement
is
not
regarded
as
an
authoritative
creed
but
simply
takes
its
place
as
one
out
of
many
summaries
for
popular
diffusion
christianity
teaches
that
god
is
our
father
full
of
love
for
all
of
us
it
learns
from
jesus
that
the
father
listens
to
our
prayers
and
watches
over
us
with
even
more
tender
care
than
over
the
lilies
of
the
field
and
the
birds
of
the
air
learns
from
jesus
too
that
however
important
it
may
be
to
have
correct
views
concerning
religious
matters
it
is
much
more
important
to
love
god
with
all
our
heart
and
mind
and
soul
and
strength
and
our
neighbour
as
ourselves
for
he
says
that
these
are
the
first
two
commandments
and
that
there
is
no
other
whatever
that
is
greater
than
these
learns
from
jesus
also
that
the
way
to
enter
the
kingdom
of
heaven
is
not
merely
to
hold
a
correct
theology
or
to
receive
any
outward
sacraments
but
to
be
converted
and
become
as
little
children
loving
pure
christianity
teaches
that
god
our
father
claims
us
all
as
children
and
that
when
jesus
speaks
of
himself
as
god
son
he
means
us
all
to
remember
that
we
are
god
children
too
though
unhappily
we
have
stained
our
sonship
and
daughterhood
with
many
unworthy
thoughts
and
deeds
christianity
loves
the
parable
of
the
prodigal
son
because
it
shows
so
clearly
and
so
beautifully
the
love
and
forgiveness
of
god
and
with
what
tender
pity
he
looks
on
us
when
we
have
sinned
christianity
believes
that
god
speaks
to
his
children
now
as
truly
as
he
did
to
the
prophets
of
old
and
to
jesus
christ
comforting
strengthening
enlightening
them
conscience
itself
is
his
holy
voice
christianity
sees
in
jesus
christ
a
supremely
beautiful
life
and
character
a
marvellous
inspiration
for
us
all
an
ideal
after
which
we
may
strive
and
it
loves
to
think
of
him
as
our
elder
brother
of
the
same
nature
as
ourselves
christianity
does
not
believe
that
god
will
plunge
any
of
his
children
into
everlasting
woe
such
a
thought
of
god
is
a
contradiction
of
his
fatherhood
he
is
leading
us
all
by
different
ways
towards
the
pure
and
holy
life
for
which
he
brought
us
into
being
along
with
this
may
be
taken
the
declaration
adopted
as
a
result
of
somewhat
protracted
discussions
at
the
national
conference
of
unitarians
in
america
it
would
probably
be
accepted
in
all
similar
assemblies
churches
accept
the
religion
of
jesus
holding
in
accordance
with
his
teaching
that
practical
religion
is
summed
up
in
love
to
god
and
love
to
man
and
we
invite
to
our
fellowship
any
who
while
differing
from
us
in
belief
are
in
general
sympathy
with
our
spirit
and
our
practical
aims
unitarians
and
other
religious
liberals
the
broadly
sympathetic
spirit
which
has
been
observed
at
work
in
the
foregoing
story
has
led
to
interesting
relationships
between
unitarians
and
some
other
religious
bodies
the
universalists
who
are
strongest
in
the
united
states
are
cordially
fraternal
with
them
and
a
large
proportion
of
the
a
body
are
equally
close
in
sympathy
the
hicksite
friends
named
after
elias
hicks
who
early
in
the
nineteenth
century
avowed
views
and
some
other
religious
bodies
less
conspicuous
are
more
or
less
directly
included
in
the
unitarian
forces
though
not
organically
in
union
with
the
french
liberal
protestants
there
has
been
warm
for
many
years
and
the
same
is
true
of
dutch
german
and
swiss
reformers
since
the
visit
of
rammohun
roy
the
indian
reformer
in
the
english
in
particular
have
developed
kindly
relations
with
the
indian
theist
movement
and
students
from
india
and
japan
are
regularly
educated
at
oxford
for
the
ministry
of
free
religion
in
their
own
countries
it
is
in
this
way
more
than
by
the
ordinary
types
of
missionary
activity
that
unitarians
have
hitherto
attempted
to
influence
the
races
during
recent
years
there
have
been
held
international
congresses
promoted
by
the
unitarians
of
great
britain
america
and
transylvania
and
attended
by
representatives
of
the
various
sections
just
named
as
well
as
by
others
from
the
orthodox
churches
including
anglican
and
romanist
who
venture
to
brave
the
authorities
thus
far
proposals
have
already
been
made
for
a
union
of
religious
liberals
in
view
of
the
remarkable
success
of
these
great
congresses
but
the
circumstances
of
the
different
groups
especially
in
germany
and
holland
seem
to
forbid
expectation
of
such
a
development
within
any
near
period
on
the
whole
unitarians
appear
to
be
encouraged
by
the
signs
of
the
times
and
to
do
their
