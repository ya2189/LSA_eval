preface
although
this
history
of
horse
embraces
a
period
in
the
south
african
campaign
that
was
crowded
with
great
issues
it
makes
no
pretence
to
rank
among
the
many
able
and
comprehensive
works
dealing
with
those
events
elaborate
descriptions
and
criticisms
of
operations
as
a
whole
have
been
purposely
avoided
except
so
far
as
they
serve
to
explain
and
emphasise
actions
in
which
the
corps
took
part
first
of
all
the
book
is
intended
to
be
no
more
than
a
regimental
record
enlivened
by
the
personal
experiences
of
men
who
helped
to
make
history
at
a
time
when
the
whole
british
empire
was
moved
by
one
impulse
part
in
that
movement
is
the
inspiring
theme
and
one
object
has
been
to
show
how
the
idea
of
organising
an
indian
volunteer
contingent
for
service
in
south
africa
passed
from
inception
to
accomplishment
through
the
efforts
of
a
committee
in
calcutta
which
made
itself
responsible
for
every
financial
liability
in
connection
with
the
corps
from
its
formation
to
its
disbandment
the
cost
of
publication
is
being
defrayed
out
of
a
balance
of
funds
remaining
in
the
hands
of
the
committee
and
each
member
of
the
corps
will
receive
a
copy
as
a
souvenir
of
his
interesting
experiences
and
a
proof
that
his
services
are
still
remembered
publication
however
is
not
restricted
to
members
of
the
corps
and
the
editor
ventures
to
think
that
this
book
will
suggest
to
general
readers
many
points
worthy
of
consideration
it
illustrates
the
facility
with
which
british
subjects
in
india
are
able
to
band
themselves
together
and
affords
yet
another
instance
of
many
in
which
the
indian
government
has
shown
itself
capable
of
utilising
instantly
its
resources
for
the
benefit
and
more
than
this
it
will
stand
as
a
proof
of
the
cordiality
with
which
the
indian
and
forward
at
a
time
of
imperial
need
with
offers
of
personal
service
or
liberal
subscriptions
which
enabled
the
committee
to
raise
and
despatch
a
mounted
contingent
completely
equipped
in
every
detail
among
those
who
have
assisted
the
editor
with
information
that
has
enabled
him
to
produce

introduction
to

belongs
the
high
honour
of
having
represented
all
india
in
a
movement
the
magnitude
and
effects
of
which
we
are
only
beginning
to
appreciate
while
the
stubborn
struggle
for
supremacy
in
south
africa
lasted
no
true
sons
of
the
empire
allowed
themselves
to
count
the
cost
some
were
prepared
to
pay
it
in
blood
others
in
treasure
to
make
success
certain
and
none
allowed
himself
to
harbour
even
the
shadow
of
a
thought
that
failure
with
all
its
inevitable
disasters
could
befall
us
so
long
as
the
mother
country
and
her
offshoots
held
together
at
the
outset
only
those
blessed
with
exceptional
foresight
could
have
believed
in
the
completeness
of
a
federation
the
elements
of
which
were
bound
together
by
no
other
ties
than
sentiment
selfish
interests
were
merged
in
combined
efforts
for
the
common
weal
and
while
the
necessity
for
action
lasted
few
cared
to
reckon
the
price
they
were
paying
for
an
idea
even
the
advent
of
peace
has
hardly
brought
home
to
us
a
knowledge
of
all
that
war
in
south
africa
meant
not
only
in
a
military
sense
but
also
in
its
greater
imperial
significance
the
men
who
fought
and
bled
for
the
noble
sentiment
of
british
brotherhood
never
dreamed
that
they
were
doing
more
than
duty
demanded
though
they
had
perhaps
given
up
every
chance
of
success
in
life
to
answer
the
call
of
patriotism
and
among
those
who
stayed
at
home
there
are
millions
untouched
by
the
bitterness
of
personal
bereavement
who
can
have
no
conception
of
the
sacrifices
that
were
made
to
keep
our
empire
whole
casualty
lists
with
all
their
details
of
killed
and
wounded
do
not
tell
half
the
story
to
know
it
all
we
must
dip
deep
into
the
private
records
of
every
contingent
british
and
colonial
that
volunteered
for
active
service
and
deeper
still
to
fathom
the
motives
of
men
who
when
their
country
seemed
to
need
them
threw
aside
all
other
considerations
and
rallied
to
her
standard
continental
critics
may
sneer
at
us
for
making
much
of
this
idea
but
none
know
better
than
they
do
the
difference
between
loyalty
expressed
in
such
a
noble
form
and
the
mere
instinct
of
that
too
often
passes
current
for
patriotism
they
tell
us
that
it
is
every
duty
to
be
a
soldier
and
every
duty
to
die
if
necessary
for
his
country
but
when
they
see
nations
from
every
quarter
of
the
world
coming
into
line
by
their
own
free
will
and
all
welded
together
by
one
sentiment
they
have
no
better
name
for
it
than
lust
of
empire
nevertheless
they
know
it
for
what
it
is
a
thing
of
which
they
had
previously
no
conception
and
they
recognise
in
the
impulses
that
led
to
this
mighty
manifestation
the
secret
of
great
power
let
envious
rivals
say
what
they
will
let
them
magnify
our
reverses
and
minimise
our
triumphs
if
the
process
pleases
them
in
spite
of
everything
the
south
african
war
stands
a
great
epoch
of
an
age
that
will
some
day
come
to
be
reckoned
among
the
greatest
in
british
history
and
all
who
have
helped
towards
the
shaping
of
events
at
this
memorable
time
can
at
least
claim
to
have
earned
the
gratitude
of
posterity
and
india
may
well
be
proud
of
her
share
in
the
work
measured
by
the
mere
number
of
men
whom
she
sent
to
the
war
her
contribution
seems
perhaps
comparatively
small
but
when
we
remember
the
sources
from
which
that
contingent
was
drawn
the
munificence
of
gifts
from
europeans
and
natives
alike
for
its
equipment
and
maintenance
and
all
the
sacrifices
that
involved
for
every
member
of
the
little
force
we
can
not
but
admire
the
spirit
that
called
it
into
being
a
great
crisis
was
not
necessary
to
convince
us
that
british
residents
in
india
would
fight
if
called
upon
with
all
the
valour
that
distinguished
volunteers
of
old
few
however
would
have
been
bold
enough
to
predict
that
for
any
conceivable
cause
hundreds
of
men
would
readily
relinquish
all
that
they
had
struggled
for
give
up
the
fruits
of
half
a
labour
and
calmly
face
the
certainty
of
irreparable
losses
without
asking
for
anything
in
return
except
the
opportunity
of
serving
their
country
on
a
meagre
pay
still
less
could
anybody
have
imagined
that
a
time
might
come
when
indian
natives
debarred
from
the
chance
of
proving
their
loyalty
by
personal
service
would
give
without
stint
towards
a
fund
for
equipping
a
force
to
fight
in
a
distant
land
against
the
enemies
of
the
british
raj
if
indian
princes
had
been
permitted
to
raise
troops
for
the
war
in
south
africa
our
eastern
contingent
would
have
numbered
thousands
instead
of
hundreds
what
natives
were
not
allowed
to
give
in
men
they
gave
in
cash
and
in
substance
according
to
their
means
thereby
showing
that
they
were
with
us
in
a
desire
to
defend
the
empire
against
any
assailant
in
reality
this
meant
more
than
an
offer
of
armed
forces
and
to
that
extent
it
was
worthy
to
rank
with
the
of
who
gave
personal
service
and
thereby
took
upon
themselves
a
burden
the
weight
of
which
can
not
be
readily
estimated
it
must
not
be
forgotten
that
raising
a
corps
of
volunteers
in
india
is
a
very
different
matter
from
the
enrolment
of
a
similar
force
at
home
or
wherever
there
are
dense
populations
and
to
be
drawn
upon
there
are
no
idle
men
in
india
everyone
having
gone
there
to
fill
an
appointment
and
earn
his
livelihood
when
the
call
came
therefore
it
could
only
be
answered
by
sacrifices
or
not
at
all
and
nobody
is
more
conscious
of
this
fact
than
the
man
whose
laconic
appeal
for
volunteers
brought
three
or
four
times
more
offers
than
he
could
possibly
accept
in
his
opinion
men
who
vacated
appointments
worth
from
to
rupees
a
month
and
went
to
fight
for
their
country
on
a
day
have
given
a
much
larger
contribution
to
the
war
fund
than
they
could
as
an
instance
he
mentions
three
members
of
the
medical
profession
doctors
charteris
moorhouse
and
woollright
each
of
whom
threw
up
a
lucrative
practice
and
joined
the
ranks
as
a
trooper
these
are
not
exceptional
but
simply
typical
cases
scores
of
other
men
gave
up
equally
remunerative
appointments
with
the
same
noble
unselfishness
to
enrol
themselves
in
horse
to
colonel
lumsden
alone
belongs
the
honour
of
having
evoked
this
splendid
manifestation
of
patriotic
feeling
the
idea
of
forming
a
corps
of
indian
volunteers
was
his
and
though
similar
thoughts
may
have
been
in
many
minds
at
the
same
moment
nobody
had
given
a
practical
turn
to
them
until
his
in
every
all
into
active
and
cordial
how
all
that
came
about
will
be
told
with
fuller
circumstances
in
its
proper
place
but
some
reference
must
be
made
here
to
the
man
whose
firm
faith
in
the
patriotism
and
soldierly
qualities
of
indian
volunteers
led
him
to
the
inception
of
a
scheme
which
events
have
so
abundantly
justified
dugald
mctavish
lumsden
needs
no
introduction
to
the
east
where
the
best
and
perhaps
the
happiest
years
of
his
life
have
been
spent
without
some
details
concerning
him
however
completeness
could
not
be
claimed
for
any
record
of
the
corps
which
is
now
identified
with
his
name
the
eldest
son
of
the
late
james
lumsden
of
peterhead
aberdeenshire
he
was
born
in
at
the
age
of
he
obtained
an
appointment
on
the
borelli
tea
estate
in
the
tezpur
district
of
assam
and
sailed
for
india
consciously
or
unconsciously
he
must
have
taken
with
him
some
military
ambitions
imbibed
through
intimate
association
with
leaders
of
the
volunteer
movement
in
scotland
at
any
rate
he
soon
became
known
as
a
keen
volunteer
in
the
land
of
his
adoption
and
when
in
the
durrung
mounted
rifles
was
formed
he
was
given
a
captaincy
a
year
later
that
corps
lost
its
identity
as
other
local
units
did
in
the
territorial
title
of
assam
valley
light
horse
with
colonel
buckingham
as
commandant
while
captain
lumsden
got
his
majority
and
took
command
of
f
squadron
in
the
durrung
district
subsequently
he
commanded
the
regiment
for
a
time
and
though
he
left
india
in
he
did
not
lose
touch
with
his
old
comrades
every
year
he
returned
to
spend
the
cold
weather
among
his
friends
in
assam
showing
always
undiminished
interest
in
the
welfare
of
his
old
regiment
thus
when
the
time
came
for
a
call
to
active
service
he
had
no
sort
of
doubt
what
the
response
would
be
from
the
hardy
planters
of
northern
bengal
himself
an
enthusiastic
and
shot
he
knew
how
to
value
the
qualities
that
are
developed
in
hunting
and
stalking
wild
game
and
his
experience
of
indian
volunteers
was
not
confined
to
his
own
district
he
knew
every
corps
in
bengal
by
reputation
and
could
thus
gauge
with
an
approach
to
accuracy
the
numbers
on
which
he
would
be
able
to
draw
for
the
formation
of
an
indian
contingent
much
travel
in
many
lands
had
also
made
him
a
good
judge
of
men
as
evidenced
by
the
first
thing
he
did
when
the
idea
of
calling
upon
india
to
take
up
her
share
of
the
imperial
burden
came
to
him
at
that
time
he
was
travelling
in
australia
and
had
no
means
of
knowing
how
deeply
the
feelings
of
british
residents
and
natives
of
the
east
had
been
stirred
by
news
of
the
reverses
to
our
arms
in
south
africa
the
dark
days
of
stormberg
and
magersfontein
had
thrown
their
shadow
over
australia
as
over
england
chilling
the
hearts
of
people
who
until
then
had
refused
to
believe
that
british
troops
could
be
baulked
by
any
foes
notwithstanding
the
stern
lesson
of
investment
through
that
darkness
they
were
groping
sullenly
towards
the
light
and
wondering
what
national
sacrifices
would
have
to
be
made
before
the
humiliation
could
be
wiped
out
it
is
in
such
moments
of
emergency
that
natural
leaders
come
to
the
front
among
the
few
in
england
or
the
colonies
who
realised
the
military
value
of
volunteers
was
colonel
lumsden
though
thousands
of
miles
away
from
the
scenes
of
early
associations
his
thoughts
turned
at
once
to
the
bold
riders
and
skilful
marksmen
with
whom
he
had
so
often
shared
the
exciting
incidents
of
the
chase
he
made
up
his
mind
at
once
that
the
planters
on
whose
spirit
he
could
rely
were
the
very
men
wanted
for
south
african
fighting
on
the
parade
ground
they
might
not
be
all
that
soldiers
whose
minds
are
fettered
by
rules
and
traditions
would
desire
but
he
knew
how
long
days
of
exercise
in
the
open
air
at
their
ordinary
avocations
varied
by
polo
and
hunting
had
toughened
their
fibre
and
hardened
their
nerves
he
could
count
on
every
one
of
them
also
for
keen
intelligence
which
he
rightly
regarded
as
more
important
than
mere
obedience
to
orders
where
every
man
might
be
called
upon
to
think
and
act
for
himself
colonel
lumsden
would
be
the
last
to
depreciate
regular
soldiers
or
undervalue
their
discipline
but
experience
had
taught
him
that
men
who
can
exercise
and
develop
powers
of
endurance
for
the
mere
pleasure
of
excelling
in
manly
sports
adapt
themselves
readily
enough
to
military
duties
to
them
at
any
rate
the
prospect
of
hardships
or
privations
would
be
no
deterrent
the
imminence
of
danger
only
an
additional
incentive
on
december
day
to
be
afterwards
borne
in
mournful
lumsden
made
up
his
mind
that
the
time
for
action
had
come
to
every
briton
who
could
see
his
way
to
giving
the
mother
country
a
helpful
hand
he
cabled
at
once
to
his
friend
sir
patrick
playfair
in
calcutta
his
proposal
to
raise
a
corps
of
european
mounted
infantry
for
service
in
south
africa
and
backed
it
with
an
offer
not
only
to
take
the
field
himself
but
to
contribute
a
princely
sum
in
aid
of
a
fund
for
equipping
any
force
the
government
might
sanction
then
without
waiting
to
know
whether
his
services
had
been
accepted
he
took
passage
by
the
next
steamer
for
india
chapter
i
the
corps
was
raised
and
offer
government
fifty
thousand
rupees
and
my
services
any
capacity
towards
raising
european
mounted
infantry
contingent
india

cape

do
not
divulge

until
my
these
were
the
stirring
words
of
colonel
laconic
message
flashed
by
cable
from
australia
to
calcutta
at
a
time
when
all
india
was
ripe
for
any
movement
in
aid
of
the
empire
and
only
waiting
for
a
lead
in
the
course
it
should
take
no
wonder
that
the
spirit
of
a
man
whose
enthusiastic
confidence
was
expressed
in
an
offer
so
munificent
communicated
itself
to
all
whom
sir
patrick
playfair
consulted
on
the
subject
still
official
susceptibilities
ever
prone
to
look
askance
at
anything
that
seems
like
civilian
interference
with
military
prerogatives
had
to
be
considered
tact
was
necessary
at
the
very
outset
to
avoid
all
possibility
of
friction
colonel
lumsden
had
evidently
foreseen
this
when
he
selected
as
the
recipient
of
his
cable
message
an
of
diplomatic
temperament
great
social
influence
and
varied
experience
few
men
if
any
could
have
been
better
qualified
for
the
delicate
negotiations
or
could
have
appealed
to
the
indian
public
native
and
european
with
more
certainty
of
success
than
sir
patrick
playfair
whose
services
then
and
for
months
afterwards
entitle
him
to
a
niche
in
walhalla
beside
the
founder
of
horse
even
at
the
sacrifice
of
continuity
it
is
appropriate
to
quote
here
an
appreciative
comment
by
one
who
knew
how
much
sir
patrick
playfair
did
towards
the
formation
and
equipment
of
a
thoroughly
representative
force
from
the
moment
of
receiving
colonel
telegram
he
displayed
the
keenest
interest
in
its
object
and
endeavoured
to
ensure
a
successful
issue
with
all
the
energy
that
has
characterised
him
in
his
advocacy
and
support
of
many
public
enterprises
during
a
brilliant
career
he
was
the
prime
mover
in
every
social
function
organised
in
honour
of
horse
and
in
everything
done
for
their
benefit
apart
from
military
details
while
they
remained
in
india
after
their
departure
for
the
front
he
never
lost
an
opportunity
of
identifying
himself
with
them
in
every
way
and
none
would
have
been
keener
than
he
to
share
their
dangers
and
hardships
if
his
position
had
enabled
him
to
accompany
them
in
this
connection
sir
patrick
had
an
entertaining
dialogue
one
day
with
general
patterson
of
the
united
states
army
who
said
i
have
been
wondering
about
is
why
you
did
not
go
yourself
sir
to
this
the
knight
replied
you
know
i
am
a
busy
man
of
course
i
should
have
liked
to
go
above
all
things
but
with
my
engagements
it
was
yes
said
the
general
guess
like
artemus
friend
the
baldinsville
editor
who
would
to
wade
in
gore
but
whose
country
bade
him
stay
at
home
and
announce
week
by
week
the
measures
taken
by
government
or
like
artemus
himself
who
having
given
two
cousins
to
the
war
was
ready
to
sacrifice
his
brother
and
shed
the
blood
of
all
his
relations
not
see
the
rebellyin
as
it
was
sir
patrick
took
the
pains
to
publish
every
item
of
interest
sent
to
him
by
the
officer
commanding
throughout
the
campaign
when
after
twelve
months
of
honourable
service
the
corps
turned
homewards
again
he
took
the
initiative
in
preparing
a
welcome
worthy
of
them
and
after
horse
had
been
disbanded
he
showed
a
kindly
interest
in
the
men
by
endeavouring
to
procure
appointments
for
all
who
needed
assistance
of
that
kind
and
thereby
won
their
gratitude
as
he
had
long
before
gained
their
esteem
this
is
anticipating
events
but
like
the
prologue
to
a
play
it
may
help
to
give
some
idea
of
a
character
whose
influence
on
the
whole
story
is
potent
though
not
often
in
evidence
illustration
elliott
curzon
sir
patrick
first
step
was
to
approach
general
maitland
military
secretary
to
the
government
of
india
to
whom
he
made
known
colonel
offer
and
explained
something
of
its
probable
scope
general
maitland
who
warmly
supported
the
proposal
said
he
would
place
it
before
his
excellency
the
viceroy
but
intimated
that
the
matter
would
then
have
to
be
referred
to
the
war
office
without
whose
consent
the
government
of
india
could
do
nothing
in
connection
with
the
war
at
that
time
colonel
lumsden
was
on
his
way
to
calcutta
and
had
telegraphed
again
from
albany
to
find
out
what
progress
was
being
made
but
got
no
answer
sir
patrick
knowing
his
man
had
no
misgivings
that
he
might
turn
back
discouraged
by
the
prospect
of
an
official
cold
shoulder
lord
curzon
was
still
absent
from
calcutta
on
tour
and
the
the
late
sir
william
lockhart
had
not
returned
from
his
official
round
of
inspection
in
burma
so
that
no
immediate
opportunity
occurred
for
placing
the
proposal
before
either
of
them
at
a
personal
interview
general
maitland
however
did
more
than
he
had
promised
by
so
urging
the
case
in
a
communication
to
the
viceroy
that
his
excellency
took
it
up
and
immediately
on
his
arrival
in
calcutta
telegraphed
to
the
who
thereupon
gave
his
approval
promptly
the
headquarters
authorities
asked
how
many
men
were
to
go
and
sir
patrick
said
he
thought
from
two
hundred
and
fifty
to
three
hundred
that
suggestion
was
embodied
in
a
telegram
to
the
war
office
which
as
usual
took
time
to
consider
it
again
colonel
lumsden
who
had
then
reached
colombo
cabled
for
information
as
to
the
state
of
affairs
but
again
no
reply
was
vouchsafed
so
he
came
on
fully
prepared
to
meet
disappointment
at
the
end
of
his
journey
when
he
got
within
sight
of
land
however
all
india
knew
of
his
splendid
offer
and
its
acceptance
by
the
home
government
the
whole
story
had
been
published
in
every
newspaper
two
days
before
colonel
lumsden
steamed
up
the
hooghly
to
find
himself
a
hero
crowds
of
his
friends
and
admirers
were
there
to
welcome
him
as
chief
of
a
corps
that
had
neither
a
local
habitation
nor
a
name
nor
even
a
substantial
existence
at
the
moment
with
characteristic
abnegation
of
self
he
had
offered
his
services
in
any
capacity
but
nobody
doubted
from
the
hour
of
his
arrival
in
calcutta
that
whatever
force
india
might
send
to
the
front
would
have
lumsden
for
its
leader
the
newspapers
even
began
to
give
his
name
to
the
contingent
before
it
had
assumed
bodily
shape
or
anybody
knew
exactly
how
it
was
to
be
raised
some
days
later
the
popular
choice
was
confirmed
by
publication
of
a
war
office
order
couched
in
the
following
words
government
having
accepted
the
offer
of
the
government
of
india
to
provide
a
force
of
mounted
volunteers
for
service
in
south
africa
two
companies
of
mounted
infantry
to
be
called
the
indian
mounted
infantry
corps
horse
will
be
raised
immediately
at
calcutta
under
the
command
of
mct
lumsden
of
the
volunteer
force
of
india
supernumerary
list
assam
valley
light
with
this
order
giving
unqualified
approval
of
the
project
came
a
mobilisation
scheme
in
which
the
government
undertook
to
provide
the
necessary
for
use
on
board
ship
only
the
transport
the
daily
rations
as
for
other
soldiers
the
weapons
the
munitions
of
war
and
pay
at
the
rate
of
a
day
but
nothing
else
the
rest
was
left
to
private
enterprise
working
on
popular
enthusiasm
and
the
loyal
sentiments
of
a
great
community
towards
the
sum
requisite
for
the
complete
equipment
and
maintenance
of
a
mounted
force
in
the
field
even
half
a
lakh
of
rupees
would
not
go
very
far
the
spirit
that
had
prompted
one
man
to
offer
that
sum
and
his
own
services
to
boot
proved
contagious
however
and
colonel
lumsden
had
so
little
doubt
what
the
result
would
be
that
he
immediately
announced
his
readiness
to
receive
applications
from
men
who
might
be
willing
to
serve
in
south
africa
for
a
year
or
not
less
than
the
period
of
the
that
call
was
published
by
indian
newspapers
on
january
and
in
response
volunteers
sent
their
names
from
every
district
far
and
near
until
colonel
lumsden
might
have
enrolled
a
thousand
as
easily
as
the
two
or
three
hundred
sanctioned
by
government
his
one
difficulty
indeed
was
that
of
selection
and
there
the
experience
he
had
gained
from
studying
character
closely
under
many
different
conditions
came
in
he
was
assisted
by
suggestions
from
officers
commanding
the
calcutta
light
horse
the
assam
valley
light
horse
the
surma
valley
light
horse
the
behar
light
horse
the
punjab
the
mysore
and
the
rangoon
volunteer
corps
authorities
at
home
had
by
that
time
learned
a
very
important
lesson
the
outcome
of
which
was
expressed
in
a
phrase
very
different
from
the
unlucky
telegram
that
gave
so
much
offence
to
australians
a
few
weeks
earlier
colonel
lumsden
was
told
will
be
given
to
volunteers
from
mounted
volunteer
corps
but
volunteers
belonging
to
infantry
corps
who
may
possess
the
requisite
qualifications
will
also
be
one
of
the
qualifications
laid
down
was
that
they
should
be
before
joining
horse
here
the
value
of
previous
training
in
military
duties
and
of
something
more
than
haphazard
horsemanship
was
recognised
and
happily
colonel
lumsden
knew
exactly
the
sort
of
men
who
would
meet
both
requirements
especially
as
the
limits
of
age
between
twenty
and
forty
brought
the
best
of
those
who
had
the
riding
and
shooting
experiences
incidental
to
a
life
into
the
category
it
is
not
surprising
if
he
showed
a
partiality
for
them
when
rival
claims
had
to
be
decided
upon
the
fact
that
many
of
them
offered
to
bring
their
own
horses
weighed
nothing
with
him
though
he
knew
that
the
companies
would
have
to
be
mounted
somehow
and
that
the
government
had
explicitly
declined
to
provide
horses
for
that
purpose
either
by
private
contributions
in
kind
or
by
public
subscription
toward
the
necessary
funds
for
purchasing
a
horse
for
each
trooper
had
to
be
furnished
but
this
consideration
did
not
weigh
for
a
moment
against
the
chances
of
a
man
who
could
only
give
himself
to
the
service
so
long
as
he
had
in
essential
points
better
qualifications
than
other
candidates
could
boast
the
wife
of
a
prominent
and
popular
a
as
a
great
favour
that
her
brother
might
be
allowed
to
serve
as
a
trooper
in
the
corps
to
such
a
pleader
sir
patrick
could
not
say
so
he
arranged
a
little
dinner
at
which
the
fascinating
lady
was
to
sit
beside
colonel
lumsden
whether
her
gentle
persuasions
prevailed
or
the
merits
were
too
obvious
to
be
disregarded
it
is
certain
that
he
joined
the
ranks
of
horse
and
so
completely
justified
the
choice
that
he
is
now
an
officer
of
the
regular
army
and
a
companion
of
the
distinguished
service
order
naturally
the
selection
of
two
hundred
and
fifty
men
to
represent
all
india
from
among
a
thousand
who
were
anxious
for
the
opportunity
of
seeing
active
service
gave
rise
to
much
jealousy
and
on
the
part
of
the
rejected
reading
some
of
their
vituperations
one
might
imagine
that
they
had
been
aspirants
to
posts
of
high
distinction
or
at
least
to
lucrative
sinecures
rather
than
candidates
for
the
khaki
jackets
of
privates
in
a
regiment
about
to
share
the
hardships
of
a
perilous
campaign
one
disappointed
applicant
whose
martial
ardour
was
not
to
be
quenched
by
rejection
wrote
angrily
to
the
suggesting
that
there
was
gross
favouritism
in
the
preference
shown
for
planters
over
townsmen
his
letter
is
worth
quoting
at
length
as
typical
of
the
fighting
spirit
that
had
been
aroused
everywhere
by
colonel
patriotic
manifesto
thus
he
wrote
the
editor
of
the
sir
hope
i
am
in
time
to
draw
the
attention
of
the
government
to
the
style
in
which
the
selection
to
the
yeomanry
of
volunteers
is
being
conducted
because
a
man
is
the
son
of
his
father
and
owns
a
few
ponies
and
a
few
hundred
rupees
is
he
to
be
given
the
preference

contingent
of

there
is
quite
a
ring
of
mediaeval
chivalry
about
that
challenge
to
up
the
one
can
not
mistake
its
significance
and
perhaps
it
is
lucky
for
the
champion
of
behar
that
he
did
not
take
up
the
gauntlet
thus
ruthlessly
thrown
down
it
will
be
noticed
that
this
duel
after
the
manner
suggested
by
one
of
bret
heroes
was
to
precede
all
other
events
in
the
prolonged
ordeal
and
imagination
shudders
at
the
picture
of
awful
slaughter
that
would
have
been
wrought
as
the
picked
marksmen
of

and
hyderabad
and
oudh
and
assam
went
down
one
by
one
if
they
had
dared
to
face
the
deadly
rifle
of
that
truculent
citizen
of
calcutta
without
getting
a
chance
to
prove
whether
he
could

the

the
trial
by

combat
never
came
off

one
must
hope
that
a
place
was
found
in
horse
for
the
challenger
and
that
he
proved
as
formidable
on
the
field
as
in
a
printed
column
readers
may
scan
the
names
of
troopers
whose
occupations
before
enlistment
are
all
given
in
the
appendix
and
yet
be
left
speculating
whether
or
not
the
writer
of

not

in

almost
to
a
man
of

in
the
third
section
whose
mainly
from
assam
have
not
a
townsman
among
them
and
the
planters
who
make
up
an
overwhelming
majority
of
three
sections
in
company
b
would
equally
disclaim
all
knowledge
of
the
citizen
can
it
be
that
he
figures
in
the
more
casual
fourth
section
of
either
company
under
the
vague
designation
of
a
or
a
a
little
levity
may
be
pardoned
now
in
reference
to
a
matter
which
at
the
time
aroused
some
acrimony
all
that
however
was
swept
away
by
the
wave
of
enthusiasm
leaving
no
bitterness
behind
it
even
in
the
minds
of
those
who
at
first
thought
themselves
humiliated
by
rejection
if
horse
were
almost
entirely
a
corps
of
planters
few
questioned
the
care
and
discretion
with
which
colonel
lumsden
had
chosen
his
men
and
none
could
deny
that
they
made
a
goodly
show
at
manœuvres
on
the
maidan
where
their
camp
was
pitched
within
easy
reach
of
the
city
though
quartered
there
for
six
weeks
in
circumstances
that
exposed
them
to
many
temptations
those
troopers
behaved
in
a
manner
that
would
have
been
considered
exemplary
for
the
best
regiment
of
disciplined
regulars
this
is
not
surprising
when
we
consider
that
in
civil
life
they
had
been
accustomed
to
exercise
command
and
to
exact
obedience
from
others
even
at
the
risk
of
their
own
lives
at
the
outset
colonel
lumsden
made
it
a
condition
that
he
would
have
none
but
unmarried
men
in
the
ranks
and
to
this
rule
there
were
few
known
exceptions
though
some
benedicts
crept
in
undeclared
as
a
regiment
horse
had
an
de
to
maintain
from
the
day
of
its
birth
under
auspices
that
made
the
occasion
imperial
and
every
man
of
it
was
tacitly
pledged
to
prove
himself
a
worthy
recipient
of
the
honour
conferred
upon
him
as
one
of
chosen
representatives
how
that
feeling
prevailed
over
all
other
considerations
in
the
moment
when
horse
played
their
manful
part
in
battle
for
the
first
time
and
how
it
held
them
together
in
a
comradeship
that
was
akin
to
brotherhood
through
of
hard
campaigning
will
appear
as
the
narrative
unfolds
itself
it
began
to
have
an
influence
while
the
corps
was
as
yet
but
an
invertebrate
skeleton
and
it
helps
to
explain
the
anxiety
of
indian
volunteers
to
join
the
ranks
of
a
force
that
was
destined
by
the
nature
of
things
to
become
historical
one
can
understand
therefore
the
alternations
of
hope
and
depression
that
passed
over
certain
districts
where
men
who
had
offered
their
services
waited
anxiously
for
the
decision
on
which
their
chances
of
distinction
hung
some
glimpses
of
this
may
be
got
through
the
letters
received
by
colonel
lumsden
from
all
parts
of
india
at
that
time
and
from
the
diaries
in
which
thoughts
as
well
as
actions
are
recorded
by
the
men
themselves
one
begins
his
days
after

for
volunteers
had
been
the
entry

from
to

he
had
sent
in
the
names
of
twenty
men
from

after
waiting
impatiently
several
days
for
news
that
did
not
come
the
diarist
got
his
friend
to
send
two
telegrams
one
to
colonel
lumsden
the
other
direct
to
the
at
calcutta
offering
a
complete
company
the
next
day
somebody
turned
up
with
news
that
they
had
been
accepted
jubilation
on
this
score
however
lasted
no
longer
than
hours
when
it
gave
place
to
dejection
caused
by
rumours
that
they
not
accepted
after
this
wave
of
depression
passed
away
as
speedily
in
its
turn
dispelled
by
the
rays
of
hope
that
burst
out
radiantly
on
receipt
of
a
chit
from
me
to
come
in
at
under
the
next
date
comes
the
crowning
triumph
of
that
anxious
time
told
very
simply
but
in
a
way
that
makes
one
feel
the
nerves
of
those
men
throbbing
through
every
word
for
chick
runs
the
entry
who
told
me
we
really
were
accepted
then
we
met
dashing
along
on
his
bike

had
already
upset
a
a
week
later
after
many
festive
farewells
that
contingent
was
on
its
way
to
calcutta
and
foregathering
with
other
contingents
whose
experiences
had
all
been
the
same
for
every
man
of
them
was
buoyant
at
the
prospect
of
seeing
active
service
and
would
have
regarded
it
as
a
personal
slight
if
not
an
indelible
stigma
on
his
reputation
for
courage
if
he
had
been
left
behind
illustration
mysore
and
coorg
contingent
so
day
by
day
the
ranks
of
horse
gained
strength
until
their
numbers
were
complete
and
recruiting
had
to
be
stopped
while
many
candidates
whom
the
colonel
would
gladly
have
taken
tried
in
vain
for
admission
it
was
a
regiment
of
which
any
commanding
officer
might
be
proud
whether
judged
by
physical
or
mental
standards
a
corps
of
planters
it
might
have
been
justly
called
for
they
outnumbered
all
of
other
occupations
but
it
represented
many
classes
and
nearly
every
district
in

where
britishers
are
to
be
found
in
its
ranks
were

of
similar

small

thus
considerably

the

have

to

the

was
just
then
came
the
difficult
and
delicate
task
of
appointing
company

and

difficulty
enhanced
by
the
fact
that
many
volunteer
officers
had
enlisted
as
troopers
i
have
said
that
the
government
had
given
its
unqualified
approval
to
colonel
project
this
statement
however
applies
only
to
the
general
scheme
it
must
be
remembered
that
he
had
made
no
stipulation
as
to
his
own
rank
or
the
right
of
selecting
officers
and
it
was
not
in
the
nature
of
a
british
war
office
to
let
the
prerogative
of
veto
slip
entirely
out
of
its
hands
colonel
own
appointment
as
commanding
officer
came
directly
from
headquarters
on
the
suggestion
probably
of
lord
curzon
two
other
conditions
not
very
irksome
the
military
authorities
made
at
colonel
urgent
request
these
were
that
captains
commanding
companies
should
be
regular
officers
on
active
service
and
that
the
adjutant
who
would
also
act
as
quartermaster
should
be
appointed
from
the
staff
corps
or
have
graduated
in
it
these
nominations
were
left
to
the
in
india
and
in
the
ordinary
course
of
things
they
involved
the
appointment
of
regular
officers
as
and
company
other
subordinate
posts
for
which
military
experience
or
special
training
is
necessary
were
also
filled
by
regulars
who
thus
relieved
the
volunteer
troopers
of
some
laborious
duties
an
officer
second
in
command
four
captains
acting
as
senior
subalterns
four
lieutenants
a
medical
officer
and
a
veterinary
surgeon
had
still
to
be
selected
and
the
choice
must
have
involved
many
anxious
moments
seeing
how
much
depended
on
the
unknown
qualities
that
are
hidden
in
all
men
and
may
lie
dormant
for
years
only
to
be
developed
for
good
or
ill
in
the
crisis
of
an
emergency
how
colonel
lumsden
succeeded
in
this
as
in
every
other
preliminary
task
that
he
imposed
upon
himself
is
now
a
matter
of
history
to
be
dealt
with
in
proper
sequence
the
wisdom
of
his
selections
could
only
be
proved
by
events
and
to
these
as
narrated
by
men
who
were
best
able
to
judge
appeal
may
be
confidently
made
naturally
some
who
had
held
commissioned
rank
previously
and
thought
their
claims
to
consideration
indisputable
felt
sore
at
being
passed
over
in
favour
of
others
who
were
junior
to
them
in
the
volunteer
service
but
this
irritation
was
not
allowed
to
show
itself
or
interfere
with
loyal
subordination
in
all
military
duties
to
the
inviolable
pages
of
his
diary
one
whose
merits
were
not
at
the
time
so
well
known
as
they
ought
to
have
been
confides
the
pregnant
sentence
that
was
to
be
a
i
a
there
the
entry
ends
leaving
a
blank
more
eloquent
than
any
scathing
comment
could
have
been
for
all
that
the
captain
and
the
corporal
remained
on
the
best
of
terms
and
though
they
ceased
for
sake
to
call
each
other
by
their
christian
names
there
is
reason
to
believe
that
both
soon
came
to
the
conclusion
that
no
very
serious
mistake
had
been
made
in
estimating
their
relative
fitness
for
command
at
any
rate
after
a
little
friction
they
shaped
themselves
like
round
pegs
to
round
holes
but
that
is
the
habit
of
britishers
who
however
unaccustomed
to
discipline
are
not
slow
in
recognising
its
inevitable
necessity
and
its
inestimable
value
they
come
to
see
that
without
it
no
concerted
movement
whether
big
or
small
is
certain
of
success
you
can
not
conduct
military
operations
to
a
definite
end
any
more
than
you
can
navigate
a
ship
or
rule
a
family
if
individuality
is
allowed
to
take
the
form
of
insubordination
these
lessons
colonel
lumsden
began
to
inculcate
in
his
peculiarly
persuasive
way
directly
he
had
got
his
men
together
and
placed
officers
in
authority
over
them
men
and
officers
however
are
not
the
only
things
necessary
to
keep
a
fighting
unit
going
when
once
it
has
been
formed
and
organised
sir
patrick
playfair
found
the
full
equipment
of
such
a
force
no
less
costly
than
he
had
estimated
fortunately
however
he
had
foreseen
all
difficulties
in
this
connection
and
provided
for
them
after
consultation
with
general
maitland
general
wace
of
ordnance
sir
alfred
gaselee
then
sir
elles
and
the
late
harvey
it
was
decided
that
nearly
a
thousand
rupees
per
man
would
be
necessary
for
equipping
the
force
buying
horses
in
addition
to
those
brought
in
by
troopers
themselves
and
establishing
a
reserve
fund
sufficient
for
all
emergencies
that
might
arise
while
the
men
remained
on
active
service
this
meant
that
a
sum
amounting
to
two
and
a
half
lakhs
of
rupees
or
about
sixteen
thousand
five
hundred
pounds
sterling
would
have
to
be
got
together
by
public
subscription
until
this
campaign
proved
the
depth
and
sincerity
of
imperial
sentiments
among
nearly
all
classes
of
the
community
few
people
even
in
england
believed
that
such
a
sum
would
be
given
to
send
a
mere
handful
of
volunteers
on
active
service
far
from
their
home
and
most
people
having
but
a
superficial
knowledge
of
indian
affairs
would
have
ridiculed
the
suggestion
that
native
princes
or
merchants
would
contribute
in
proportion
little
less
than
johannesburg
millionaires
to
uphold
british
supremacy
in
south
africa
sir
patrick
playfair
however
knowing
by
experience
how
liberal
had
been
the
response
of
those
people
to
all
calls
on
their
generosity
and
gauging
with
remarkable
insight
the
genuineness
of
their
loyal
devotion
in
a
time
of
possible
peril
to
the
empire
had
no
doubt
what
the
result
would
be
but
even
he
was
not
prepared
for
anything
like
the
unanimity
of
enthusiasm
that
his
appeal
evoked
it
took
simply
the
form
of
a
general
invitation
to
subscribe
the
marvellous
rapidity
with
which
the
subscription
list
filled
may
therefore
be
taken
as
a
voluntary
expression
by
europeans
and
natives
alike
of
staunch
fidelity
to
the
cause

in
no
more
substantial

than
the

of

ammunition
rations
and

to
south

it
furnished
many
suggestions
of
the
greatest
importance
and
as
a
model
for
use
on
any
similar
occasion
hereafter
it
is
reproduced
at

in

this

will
be
found
of
interest
also
as
giving
a
comprehensive
idea
of
the
many
requirements
for
which
provision
had
to
be
made
by
colonel
lumsden
and
his
colleagues
their
labours
were
lightened
by
the
cordial
of
military
officials
who
went
out
of
their
way
to
render
every
possible
assistance
without
the
advice
and
practical
aid
thus
given
by
heads
of
departments
of
the
government
of
india
it
would
have
been
impossible
for
colonel
lumsden
or
any
other
commanding
officer
in
his
position
to
have
carried
out
all
the
war
office
conditions
economically
wace
as
head
of
the
ordnance
department
gave
every
facility
for
colonel
lumsden
to
indent
on
government
stores
for
clothing
and
accoutrements
at
regulation
prices
and
not
only
so
but
he
and
colonel
buckland
the
superintendent
of
army
clothing
with
hobday
and
robert
harvey
were
ready
to
place
the
fruits
of
their
long
experience
and
special
knowledge
of
various
details
at
the
service
of
colonel
lumsden
whenever
he
felt
the
need
of
advice
in
such
matters
and
captain
phillips
an
officer
on
the
staff
of
sir
alfred
gaselee
was
untiring
in
his
efforts
to
make
the
movement
a
success
so
far
as
his
personal
efforts
and
influence
could
avail
so
everything
went
well
from
the
beginning
thanks
in
great
measure
to
the
lively
interest
taken
in
the
corps
by
lord
curzon
who
was
pleased
to
become
its
honorary
colonel
and
by
all
officers
of
his
personal
staff
her
excellency
lady
curzon
was
equally
zealous
and
lent
her
influence
to
every
good
work
by
which
the
ladies
of
calcutta
sought
to
express
their
admiration
and
perhaps
their
tender
regard
for
the
heroes
who
were
going
forth
to
fight
what
form
that
expression
should
take
was
a
subject
much
debated
and
long
in
doubt
of
course
sir
patrick
playfair
had
to
be
consulted
by
a
deputation
of
charming
damsels
he
thought
a
bazaar
might
give
them
the
opportunity
they
wanted
yes
that
was
just
the
thing
but
then
came
a
string
of
fatal
objections
a
was
next
suggested
and
the
young
ladies
thought
that
idea
splendid
in
short
it
do
then
as
if
it
were
the
last
resource
to
be
thought
sort
of
forlorn
patrick
hinted
that
a
dance
might
meet
the
case
to
that
his
fair
interviewers
demurred
most
effusively
but
then
and
without
any
hypnotic
suggestion
so
sir
patrick
avers
they
began
to
see
that
something
might
be
urged
in
favour
of
it
and
at
last
with
a
unanimity
that
was
wonderful
they
decided
that
a
dance
was
the
only
means
of
fitly
celebrating
the
occasion
having
come
to
that
conclusion
all
their
coy
objections
vanished
in
a
moment
sir
patrick
saw
his
opportunity
and
seized
it
to
persuade
them
that
as
it
was
to
be
a
enterprise
they
must
manage
it
entirely
themselves
thereupon
they
formed
a
committee
of
which
miss
pugh
was
elected
honorary
secretary
invited
lady
curzon
of
kedleston
to
become
patroness
and
set
to
work
with
an
energy
which
no
mere
man
could
hope
to
rival
they
had
of
course
to
enlist
masculine
services
for
subordinate
duties
this
they
did
with
a
sweet
despotism
that
made
revolt
impossible
the
men
had
to
accept
without
a
murmur
the
positions
assigned
to
them
as
stewards
and
obeyed
every
mandate
like
the
willing
slaves
we
all
should
be
in
similar
circumstances
the
committee
of
ladies
showed
a
promptitude
in
settling
every
detail
and
a
faculty
for
organisation
which
won
from
a
military
admirer
the
approving
comment
that
they
could
conduct
a
campaign
if
they
would
only
give
their
minds
to
it
this
or
some
other
feminine
attribute
had
such
an
effect
on
the
wine
merchants
of
calcutta
that
they
sent
champagne
for
the
and
gallantly
refused
to
accept
payment
so
the
calcutta
ball
in
honour
of
horse
became
an
assured
success
almost
from
the
moment
of
its
happy
inception
brilliant
beyond
the
dreams
of
a
it
left
on
many
a
susceptible
heart
impressions
which
neither
time
nor
the
changing
scenes
of
warfare
could
dim
as
the
secret
archives
to
which
an
editor
alone
has
access
attest
and
in
a
less
romantic
way
it
proved
the
unselfish
devotion
of
those
ladies
who
after
paying
all
expenses
handed
over
a
balance
of
rupees
to
the
of

such
financial
aids
came
not
amiss
at
the
moment
government
transports
chartered
by
the
royal
indian
marine
for
taking
troops
to
natal
were
delayed
on
the
return
and
one
vessel
having
broken
down
colonel
lumsden
found
that
he
would
have
to
encamp
his
men
on
the
maidan
for
two
or
three
weeks
longer
than
he
had
anticipated
and
this
entailed
an
additional
expenditure
of
nearly
for
extra
rations
and
comforts
to
soldiers
of
spartan
mould
who
pride
themselves
on
discarding
luxuries
at
the
first
call
to
arms
this
might
have
seemed
like
pampering
the
volunteer
troopers
but
it
must
be
remembered
that
in
india
men
can
not
give
up
the
habits
of
a
lifetime
all
at
once
and
come
down
to
bare
rations
without
danger
to
their
health
and
colonel
first
object
after
getting
his
men
was
to
keep
them
fit
his
care
in
this
respect
was
justified
by
events
no
less
than
his
judgment
in
the
selection
of
men
for
mental
and
physical
attributes
at
the
end
of
a
campaigning
he
was
able
to
boast
that
his
losses
from
sickness
were
proportionately
less
than
in
any
other
regiment
this
delay
had
its
advantages
in
so
far
as
it
gave
colonel
lumsden
and
his
officers
a
chance
of
training
the
troopers
for
their
duties
and
accustoming
them
to
their
horses
before
the
day
of
embarkation
the
postponement
we
may
be
sure
was
no
disappointment
to
the
people
of
calcutta
who
felt
that
the
maidan
would
be
a
cheerless
blank
without
horse
it
will
be
well
to
give
here
a
few
details
of
organisation
by
war
office
order
the
corps
was
to
consist
of
two
companies
each
commanded
by
a
regular
officer
and
the
government
also
appointed
a
regular
adjutant
to
assist
colonel
lumsden
in
executive
work
while
colonel
eden
showers
commandant
of
the
surma
valley
light
horse
offered
to
serve
as
major
and
was
gazetted
with
that
rank
as

when
other
officers
had
been
selected
chiefly
on
the
recommendation
of

artillery
cavalry
and

were
also
attached
as
saddlers
and
signallers
and
from
the
indian
commissariat
as
transport
sergeant
the
maxim
gun
contingent
under
captain
holmes
was
raised
and
equipped
by
the
east
india
railway
company
who
offered
its
services
to
colonel
lumsden
the
calcutta
committee
had
decided
with
the
sanction
of
the
government
that
horse
should
not
want
for
adequate
regimental
transport
in
the
field
but
on
the
contrary
should
leave
india
as
a
thoroughly
organised
unit
in
that
respect
with
a
complete
train
of
transport
carts
ponies
and
pack
mules
all
properly
equipped
it
is
hardly
necessary
to
say
that
the
grant
of
transport
saddlery
and
draught
harness
for
which
provision
was
made
in
the
mobilisation
order
did
not
comprise
all
that
the
committee
desired
but
the
inexhaustible
ordnance
stores
were
again
open
to
be
requisitioned
payment
and
carts
of
the
indian
army
transport
pattern
were
drawn
in
a
similar
way
from
the
commissariat
department
the
ponies
and
mules
however
had
to
be
collected
by
agents
in
the
hill
districts
of
assam
and
thibet
a
distance
of
miles
from
calcutta
when
all
this
was
done
the
corps
could
justly
be
considered
fit
for
active
service
and
it
is
certain
that
no
contingent
volunteer
or
regular
landed
in
south
africa
with
a
more
efficient
transport
than
horse
it
came
near
being
upset
however
by
a
war
office
decision
almost
at
the
last
minute
colonel
lumsden
was
told
that
the
native
drivers
would
not
be
permitted
to
accompany
the
corps
and
that
no
natives
could
go
except
one
personal
servant
for
each
officer
and
a
limited
number
of
syces
or
grooms
in
the
proportion
of
one
to
each
charger
as
laid
down
in
the
mobilisation
scheme
this
allowance
of
three
native
attendants
to
every
officer
was
on
a
sufficiently
liberal
scale
but
it
did
not
meet
the
requirements
for
transport
purposes
therefore
colonel
lumsden
had
to
enlist
european
drivers
of
whom
were
needed
for
each
company
in
ordinary
circumstances
prejudices
would
have
combined
to
make
this
an
insuperable
difficulty
but
so
keen
was
the
anxiety
of
men
to
see
war
service
in
south
africa
that
they
volunteered
to
go
in
any
capacity
not
necessarily
menial
and
so
colonel
lumsden
got
the
full
complement
of
drivers
together
just
as
readily
as
lie
had
filled
the
ranks
with
fighting
men
war
office
conditions
stipulated
that
officers
and
troopers
of
the
corps
must
provide
their
own
horses
and
saddlery
though
nearly
all
of
the
latter
might
be
drawn
from
ordnance
stores
at
cost
price
naturally
the
supply
of
suitable
animals
for
mounted
infantry
work
had
to
be
made
a
corps
affair
from
the
outset
very
few
of
the
enlisted
troopers
owned
horses
of
a
class
that
they
would
have
cared
to
ride
through
the
rough
work
of
a
campaign
even
if
they
could
be
always
sure
of
having
their
own
and
colonel
lumsden
was
not
likely
to
countenance
any
claims
of
private
ownership
when
once
horses
were
numbered
as
of
the
troop
he
therefore
informed
every
man
who
brought
a
horse
with
him
that
it
must
be
considered
corps
property
and
might
not
be
appropriated
by
its
owner
without
the
commanding
sanction
no
other
arrangement
could
have
worked
satisfactorily
in
consideration
of
this
understanding
colonel
lumsden
promised
that
he
would
endeavour
to
obtain
from
government
a
scale
of
compensation
for
horses
thus
appropriated
and
in
the
event
of
being
successful
the
sums
obtained
under
this
head
would
be
returned
to
the
owners
of
horses
it
may
be
mentioned
in
passing
that
colonel
efforts
to
this
end
were
ultimately
successful
the
government
consenting
to
allow
an
average
of
per
horse
to
the
corps
so
that
every
man
who
brought
his
own
charger
was
compensated
at
last
illustration
kapp
messing
at
calcutta
the
the
men
having
drawn
their
rifles
with
short
bayonets
and
an
abundant
supply
of
ball
cartridges
both
for
practice
and
the
sterner
work
to
come
were
duly
clothed
and
equipped
much
to
their
satisfaction
not
many
of
these
things
in
addition
to
rifles
and
ammunition
were
free
gifts
from
government
whose
contributions
in
kind
had
to
be
supplemented
by
purchases
out
of
store
at
the
cost
of
corps
funds
and
by
gifts
from
the
appreciative
public
to
whom
no
appeals
were
made
in
vain
the
troopers
at
any
rate
were
troubled
not
a
whit
about
these
things
being
quite
satisfied
with
the
completeness
of
their
personal
outfit
even
before
pugh
and
the
ladies
of
calcutta
bethought
them
to
work
woollen
comforters
for
presentation
to
every
man
of
horse
on
the
day
of
embarkation
they
did
not
however
take
so
kindly
at
first
to
the
rifle
it
was
a
new
weapon
to
most
of
the
men
who
had
never
handled
anything
more
complicated
than
the
old
martini
carbine
so
batches
of
men
went
to
the
ranges
every
morning
to
practise
and
accustom
themselves
to
the
peculiarities
of
a
firearm
that
made
no
more
noise
than
the
crack
of
a
whip
and
no
kick
in
this
was
a
time
of
gradual
but
sometimes
painful
initiation
to
the
hardships
and
discomforts
inseparable
from
camp
life
lessons
however
distasteful
had
to
be
learned
and
it
must
be
said
that
horse
took
the
rough
with
the
smooth
cheerily
enough
enlivening
their
daily
routine
with
many
pleasantries
they
were
always
ready
to
laugh
at
a
comrade
or
with
him
in
a
merry
jest
at
their
own
expense
some
literary
contributions
from
the
ranks
to
local
papers
were
amusing
in
their
fanciful
exaggerations
which
nobody
enjoyed
more
than
did
the
troopers
whose
foibles
were
thus
humorously
railed
at
for
sanitary
reasons
they
were
one
day
ordered
by
medical
authority
to
strike
their
camp
and
pitch
it
on
fresh
ground
whereupon
one
of
them
wrote
like
a
bolt
from
the
blue
has
fallen
upon
this
camp
the
æsculapian
decree
that
we
must
go
hence
it
happened
that
the
medical
eye
of
horse
opened
wide
and
beheld
strange
sights
what
the
vision
was
has
not
been
recorded
owing
to
no
ink
being
found
in
camp
capable
of
expressing
its
blackness
but
it
is
no
secret
that
microbes
as
big
as
mastodons
were
observed
freely
gambolling
in
the
immediate
vicinity
of
the
commissariat
tent
the
marvel
is
that
a
number
of
men
can
have
lived
on
such
a
spot
for
ten
days
without
coming
to
more
serious
harm
the
green
sward
on
the
banks
of
the
nullah
has
presented
an
animated

within
the

brought
its
quota
to

a

of

from
the

are
now
in
camp
the
mysore
contingent
is
also
established
while
the

are
expected
by
these
will
number
a
few
over
fifty
and
will
prove
no

the

some

where
he
will
choose
animals
of
gentle
temperament
and
so
small
that
falling

maxim

men
scorn
to

this
question
of
riding
is
no
small
one
and
many
gallant
sportsmen
may
be
seen
tearing
down
the
lines
trying
to
get
there
before
their
horses
one
like
this
was
advised
by
a
real
tommy
atkins
to
sit
further
back
and
so
enjoy
a
longer
ride
not
the
least
pleasurable
sight
in
the
camp
is
when
bold
volunteers
begin
grooming
their
own
horses
some
never
do
more
than
the
neck
because
of
the
risk
attached
to
venturing
within
range
of
hind
feet
with
which
horses
are
notoriously
it
may
be
so
said
of

then
saddling

others
because
of
the
difficulty
in
distinguishing
between
cantle
and
pommel
when
a
saddle
a
horse
inside
to
illustrate
the
difference
there
is
a
touch
of
boyish
imagination
about
that
sketch
but
it
is
not
altogether
fanciful
some
of
the
volunteers
who
joined
first
were
by
no
means
experienced
and
to
nearly
all
the
equipments
for
mounted
infantry
in
full
campaigning
kit
were
not
less
strange
than
military
technicalities
there
was
a
rich
fund
of
amusement
for
horse
in
the
unauthorised
version
of
ordinary
commands
as
one
trooper
construed
them
when
sections
in
line
were
crowding
too
much
upon
him
he
would
say
off
man
fall
off
to
the
the
comrade
thus
admonished
would
murmur
it
all

that
is
just
what

would
repeat
in
defiance
of
the
peremptory
request
for
silence
in
the
ranks
off
fall
off
meaning
all
the
time
these
simple
incidents
of
every
day
gave
a
piquancy
to
camp
and
were
the
cause
of
more
mirth
than
the
elaborate
jokes
concocted
by
literary
troopers
could
arouse
one
civilian
in
a
playfully
prophetic
mood
devised
a
new
coat
of
arms
for
horse
which
was
published
in
the
daily
as
a
clever
play
upon
the
cant
of
heraldry
though
the
earl
marshal
and
all
the
and
all
the
learned
pursuivants
of
college
might
have
been
puzzled
if
called
upon
to
emblazon
the
quaint
conceit
with
its
complicated
quarterings
its
proper
shield
of
pretence
and
its
lurid
crest

for
the
from
life
in
camp
on
the
maidan
was
becoming
somewhat
monotonous
to
men
whose
ardent
spirits
panted
for
opportunities
of
distinction
in
the
service
and
for
freer
movement
on
the
vast
south
african
veldt
for
traces
of
this
yearning
one
may
search
in
vain
through
pages
of
diaries
to
which
men
do
not
commit
all
their
secret
thoughts
perhaps
they
regarded
a
parade
of
warlike
sentiments
as
bad
form
even
in
the
written
impressions
that
were
intended
only
for
private
perusal
so
they
contented
themselves
with
noting
briefly
the
minor
events
of
listless
days
and
the
mild
excitements
of
evenings
that
passed
swiftly
enough
in
such
social
pleasures
as
dining
or
listening
to
the
latest
london
melodies
at
a
organised
in
aid
of
the
war
fund
even
a
was
regarded
by
some
as
an
amusement
we
come
across
frequent
references
to
baths
at
the
swimming
club
tiffin
at
and
luxurious
little
dinners
at
the
bristol
the
continental
or
the
grand
but
only
by
inference
from
the
sudden
importance
given
to
these
everyday
incidents
of
civilian
life
can
we
gather
what
a
contrast
they
were
to
the
coarser
fare
and
rougher
surroundings
of
meals
in
camp
there
is
not
a
hint
of
discontent
at
being
reduced
for
the
first
time
in
their
lives
to
rations
or
at
the
hard
fatigue
work
they
were
put
to
as
a
necessary
part
of
the
daily
routine
these
manly
young
troopers
were
beginning
to
learn
the
lessons
of
subjection
to
discipline
and
endurance
of
discomforts
that
must
have
seemed
sufficiently
like
hardships
to
most
of
them
but
they
had
not
acquired
the
habit
of
grumbling
which
is
cherished
privilege
the
visits
of
crowds
to
that
camp
on
the
maidan
every
sunday
were
evidence
enough
of
the
great
interest
taken
by
all
classes
of
citizens
in
horse
who
were
properly
appreciative
of
those
attentions
and
not
quite
insensible
to
the
sweet
flattery
of
admiring
glances
from
pretty
eyes
the
motto
that
but
the
brave
deserve
the
is
one
in
which
gallant
soldiers
from
all
time
have
found
encouragement
and
horse
were
beginning
to
appropriate
it
with
other
soldierly
attributes
for
were
they
not
all
brave
and
resolved
to
prove
it
their
only
fear
was
that
the
chance
of
doing
knightly
deeds
might
not
come
to
them
and
that
they
would
land
in
south
africa
only
in
time
to
learn
that
the
war
had
been
finished
before
the
tardy
transports
could
get
there
nevertheless
we
know
that
they
relaxed
no
efforts
to
make
themselves
fit
for
the
fray
from
contributions
by
troopers
to
the
indian
papers
we
may
learn
how
zealous
they
were
to
master
the
least
attractive
duties
of
military
life
and
staff
officers
bear
witness
to
the
sincerity
and
success
of
these
endeavours
mere
forms
of
discipline
might
have
been
lacking
and
one
can
not
wonder
that
men
who
had
lived
similar
lives
sharing
the
same
sports
and
social
pleasures
found
it
difficult
at
first
to
fall
into
their
relative
positions
some
as
officers
others
as
troopers
and
to
keep
each
his
own
proper
groove
ignoring
old
associations
but
the
right
spirit
of
subordination
was
there
and
a
commander
of
irregulars
does
not
ask
for
more
if
he
has
the
true
capacity
for
leadership
the
daily
routine
of
duties
in
camp
on
the
maidan
was
designed
to
foster
this
spirit
without
making
the
yoke
of
essential
discipline
too
galling
a
description
of
it
as
given
by
one
in
the
ranks
will
show
that
horse
were
by
no
means
pampered
sybarites
even
at
that
early
stage
of
their
soldiering
at
the
sounds
and
some
minutes
later
men
clad
in
khaki
breeches
putti
gaiters
and
flannel
shirts
issue
from
the
little
bell
tents
into
the
clammy
mist
of
early
morning
and
after
obtaining
a
cup
of
tea
at
the
mess
remove
the
are
a
most
necessary
protection
against
the
heavy
their
horses
and
give
them
a
rub
down
at
we
hear
the
bugle
call
up
and
at
the
men
are
all
fallen
in
on
the
maidan
in
column
of
sections
and
go
through
the
various
evolutions
special
attention
being
given
to
mounting
and
dismounting
on
saddles
packed
with
full
kit
and
the
leading
of
horses
the
correct
and
rapid
performance
of
which
is
so
important
in
mounted
infantry
work
the
regiment
is
divided
into
two
companies
each
company
consisting
of
men
formed
into
four
sections
and
these
again
divided
into
permanent
of
four
men
each
as
a
rule
the
sections
work
independently
each
under
its
own
commander
blank
ammunition
is
liberally
expended
in
order
to
accustom
the
horses
to
the
rattle
of
musketry
most
of
the
men
are
mounted
on
but
several
ride
shapely
walers
averaging
considering
that
per
cent
of
the
horses
are
quite
untrained
as
chargers
they
are
astonishingly
quiet
and
the
the
exception
of
an
occasional
kicker
which
plays
havoc
in
the
ranks
and
is
a
source
of
some
danger
to
his
unfortunate
companions
both
men
and
quick
handy
little
brutes
and
already
they
have
learnt
to
lead
steadily
and
well
there
are
of
course
a
good
number
of
trained
horses
in
the
ranks
the
mysore
men
for
instance
being
almost
without
exception
mounted
on
silidar
horses
which
are
proving
most
satisfactory
chargers
and
are
expected
to
do
well
in
africa
after
parade
the
horses
are
watered
fed
and
groomed
by
their
respective
owners
and
then
as
pepys
would
have
said
breakfast
under
a
large
placed
at
one
end
of
the
camp
in
the
shade
of

the
morning
passes
quickly
while
men
are
drawing
and
marking
kit
cleaning
rifles
or
doing
fatigue
duty
at
pitching
tents
and
other
healthy
exercises
at
noon
we
water
and
feed
the
horses
and
is
the
tiffin
hour
at
there
is
an
afternoon
parade
sometimes
by
companies
and
sometimes
the
whole
regiment
parading
under
the
colonel
or
major
after
which
water
feed
and
and
then
dinner
and
an
early
retirement
to
bed
but
not
for
all
is
this
happy
rest
there
are
two
guard
tents
at
opposite
ends
of
the
camp
each

providing
a
sergeant
and
three

for
guard
every
hours

from

is
on

it

the

of

flattering
tributes
lived
up
to
their
reputations
by
putting
on
an
air
of
mystery
which
the
colonel
alone
could
have
dispelled
for
none
but
he
knew
the
history
of
every
man
in
the
regiment
still
nobody
would
have
thought
of
looking
for
suspected
boers
or
boer
spies
in
the
ranks
of
horse
a
good
story
however
is
told
in
this
connection
at
the
expense
of
an
officer
who
overheard
two
men
in
the
uniform
of
horse
talking
in
a
tongue
that
was
not
english
at
one
of
the
hotel
bars
the
officer
not
recognising
either
of
them
listened
curiously
and
caught
a
few
phrases
which
he
declared
to
be
german
by
the
sound
and
he
claimed
familiarity
with
that
though
he
did
not
know
enough
of
the
language
to
repeat
the
words
he
had
heard
was
german
and
no
mistake
he
said
those
two
men
in
our
uniform
were
talking
it
fluently
what
could
they
be
but
boer
spies
one
had
a
distinctly
boer
face
he
thought
and
deciding
that
something
ought
to
be
done
at
once
he
assumed
his
most
nonchalant
air
and
asked
the
two
men
politely
for
their
names
in
reply
they
gave
names
so
common
in
england
that
he
could
only
regard
them
as
aliases
his
suspicions
being
thus
seemingly
confirmed
he
took
into
his
confidence
two
who
when
the
two
were
pointed
out
to
them
saw
the
possibility
of
playing
off
a
joke
on
the
amateur
detective
for
they
recognised
in
the
one
with
a
boer
a
young
planter
from
behar
whose
fresh
boyish
appearance
had
won
for
him
the
nickname
of
he
looked
innocent
enough
to
be
capable
of
anything
admitting
that
both
these
men
had
come
with
them
from
up
country
the
two
mischievous
friends
added
we
know
much
about
that
was
enough
for
the
investigator
who
rose
at
dawn
next
morning
to
prepare
a
circumstantial
report
for
submission
to
the
colonel
he
declared
this
to
be
duty
and
announced
a
stern
determination
to
go
through
with
it
in
spite
of
pretended
protestations
from
many
comrades
who
had
somehow
got
wind
of
the
story
their
pleadings
and
wily
persuasions
only
served
to
goad
him
on
the
responsibility
of
silence
which
they
sought
to
impose
upon
him
was
too
much
for
one
in
his
position
to
bear
so
he
hurried
off
towards
the
tent
eager
to
make
his
startling
disclosures
on
the
way
however
he
met
a
trooper
who
unwittingly
the
whole
show
and
the
crestfallen
officer
learned
that
the
men
whom
he
was
going
to
denounce
as
boer
spies
had
been
for
several
years
in
coorg
and
that
the
language
they
talked
when
exchanging
confidences
in
a
public
place
was
not
german
but
canarese
such
incidents
as
these
helped
to
while
away
the
tedium
of
life
in
camp
when
the
iron
hand
of
discipline
was
beginning
to
make
itself
felt
lightly
but
firmly
a
very
little
humour
provokes
much
mirth
when
other
entertainments
are
scarce
by
that
time
even
the
in
camp
were
being
cut
short
and
the
only
note
of
revolt
that
horse
were
ever
known
to
have
sounded
arose
on
that
account
it
did
not
grow
loud
enough
to
reach
the
commanding
ears
but
is
recorded
in
the
diary
of
a
trooper
who
after
describing
a
very
pleasant
little
concert
says
were

that
would

came

and

us

and
more
songs
and
three
cheers
for
the
colonel
and
to

at
these
frank
revelations
are
worth
whole
columns
of
detailed
description
as
giving
an
insight
into
the
character
of
the
men
who
formed
horse
and
their
adaptability
to
circumstances
that
marked
the
later
days
of
their
camp
life
on
the
maidan
the
time
for
such
festivities
was
drawing
rapidly
to
a
close
and
none
but
puritanical
moralists
would
blame
them
for
making
the
most
of
it
after
the
manner
of
youth
they
had
serious
thoughts
on
occasion
however
and
all
their
letters
show
how
deeply
impressed
they
were
by
one
ceremony
the
date
of
embarkation
was
still
uncertain
when
on
wednesday
february
some
two
hundred
officers
and
men
under
colonel
command
headed
by
the
band
of
the
royal
irish
rifles
marched
from
their
camp
to
the
cathedral
in
calcutta
where
a
special
evening
service
of
farewell
was
to
be
celebrated
the
viceroy
and
lady
curzon
sir

of
bengal
nearly
every
officer
of
the
viceregal
and
district
staffs
with
regimental
commandants
and
representatives
of
other
presidencies
attended
and
a
sympathetic
congregation
filled
every
part
of
the
building
soldiers
and
civilians
joined
in
singing
the
processional
hymn
christian
soldiers
their
voices
mingling
with
an
effect
never
to
be
forgotten
by
anybody
who
took
part
in
that
devotional
service
the
read
the
first
lesson
and
colonel
lumsden
the
second
the
choir
sang
the
good
fight
and
a
deep
silence
fell
on
the
congregation
when
bishop
welldon
began
his
address
to
the
contingent
that
numbered
in
its
ranks
many
men
whose
course
in
life
had
been
guided
by
the
high
principles
instilled
by
him
when
he
was
master
and
they
schoolboys
at
tonbridge
and
harrow
in
a
clear
strong
voice
the
ring
of
which
they
knew
so
well
he
spoke
to
them
and
their
comrades
saying
this
is
a
service
of
unique
interest
in
the
history
of
our
city
and
of
our
cathedral
it
is
one
of
those
occasions
which
make
us
realise
amid
many
differences
the
essential
fact
of
our
national
spiritual
unity
all
who
are
loyal
all
who
are
patriotic
in
calcutta
are
gathered
or
would
have
gladly
gathered
within
this
cathedral
there
is
not
in
all
this
is
not
i
think
in
all
british
heart
that
is
not
moved
with
sympathy
and
admiration
for
you
my
brethren
who
are
going
forth
to
the
war
in
south
africa
and
surely
there
is
not
a
british
heart
but
feels
how
just
it
is
how
wise
and
how
truly
consonant
with
the
best
traditions
of
our
race
that
it
should
be
your
wish
on
the
eve
of
your
departure
to
seek
the
protection
of
invite
the
benediction
of
and
to
consecrate
yourselves
to
the
name
and
service
of
the
most
high
god
for
if
it
has
been
possible
at
other
times
and
in
other
places
within
the
last
few
weeks
to
strike
a
note
of
felicity
and
do
not
say
that
they
have
been
unduly
prominent
but
who
has
not
heard
them
there
has
been
excitement
merriment
and
applause
on
your
behalf
it
is
a
note
that
i
would
not
sound
this
evening
you
are
going
i
know
with
deep
solemnity
and
resolution
and
you
are
going
as
men
who
have
undertaken
a
noble
duty
from
which
you
might
have
held
aloof
without
reproach
in
the
full
consciousness
of
its
cost
and
peril
and
in
the
sure
conviction
that
the
part
you
are
playing
is
not
unworthy
as
indeed
it
is
not
of
the
british
race
and
the
british
empire
you
are
proud
then
of
your
mission
but
it
may
well
be
that
someone
who
looks
forward
with
eager
anticipation
to
the
future
is
yet
in
his
heart
possessed
with
the
not
ignoble
anxiety
that
warfare
is
no
play
it
is
stern
and
awful
he
who
enters
upon
it
with
a
light
heart
is
no
true
soldier
of
god
or
man
you
are
assembled
now
within
the
sanctuary
of
religion
in
a
few
hours
or
days
you
will
set
sail
for
a
distant
land
it
is
certain
that
you
all
will
be
exposed
to
the
strain
and
danger
of
the
battlefield
and
it
is
by
no
means
certain
that
all
will
return
to
their
homes
in
safety
some
who
hear
me
now
will
probably
yield
their
lives
for
the
empire
can
i
forget
how
on
the
day
of
last
september
i
shook
hands
at
the
kidderpore
docks
with
the
gallant
officer
commanding
the
gloucestershire
regiment
and
how
within
a
few
weeks
from
that
day
he
had
dead
at
the
head
of
his
regiment
as
his
fate
was
so
may
be
yours
that
is
the
nobility
and
dignity
of
your
service
the
people
of
calcutta
would
not
throng
into
this
cathedral
to
pray
for
you
with
you
if
it
were
not
impressed
upon
their
minds
that
you
are
inspired
with
the
brave
ambition
that
makes
great
empires
great
when
they
shall
bid
you
farewell
as
the
troopship
slowly
passes
into
the
distance
it
will
be
with
full
hearts
and
believing
that
you
will
be
true
even
to
death
that
they
will
one
and
all
say
bless
you
go
for
the
conservation
of
the
empire
i
look
upon
the
british
empire
as
the
highest
of
human
institutions
and
realise
that
the
empire
appeals
to
the
spirit
of
chivalry
magnanimity
unselfishness
and
devotion
in
all
its
members
nobly
indeed
has
india
european
and
native
responded
of
late
to
that
inspiring
appeal
who
is
there
that
has
not
felt
his
pride
of
empire
to
be
quickened
by
the
generous
loyalty
not
of
englishmen
only
but
of
the
princes
and
nobles
of
india
to
her
majesty
the
for
that
loyalty
unexampled
as
it
is
in
the
history
of
other
peoples
is
itself
a
witness
to
the
beneficence
of
british
rule
may
i
venture
if
only
in
passing
to
express
the
hope
that
such
an
exhibition
of
loyalty
may
bring
comfort
to
the
of
that
illustrious
soldier
the
who
in
a
retrospect
of
his
life
can
recall
many
a
battle
in
which
europeans
and
indians
have
fought
side
by
side
for
the
empire
but
if
to
the
princes
and
i
not
add
to
the
people
of
india
thought
of
the
empire
makes
a
paramount
appeal
how
much
more
to
every
man
and
woman
of
us
the
imperial
spirit
is
in
the
air
it
has
passed
from
the
chamber
of
philosophical
thinkers
to
the
common
life
of
the
nation
we
are
all
imperialists
now
and
it
may
be
said
in
the
sacred
language
of
our
country
in
relation
to
her
colonies
and
dependencies
that
children
have
risen
up
and
called
her
so
in
the
hour
of
her
stress
and
suffering
there
is
not
one
colony
that
has
failed
to
render
her
aid
with
the
resources
of
its
wealth
strength
and
its
armed
men
well
is
it
then
that
englishmen
scotchmen
and
irishmen
resident
in
india
should
take
their
stand
with
the
colonists
not
of
south
africa
only
but
of
australia
and
canada
in
a
cause
which
makes
them
one
for
the
empire
means
not
conquest
alone
it
means
the
principles
upon
which
the
modern
christian
world
is
broadly
equality
freedom
of
thought
and
speech
intellectual
progress
pure
religion
and
the
sense
of
personal
responsibility
to
god
you
go
forth
and
by
your
going
you
assert
that
all
the
constituent
members
of
the
empire
are
one
as
the
apostle
said
of
old
are
members
one
of
and
again
one
member
suffer
all
the
members
suffer
with
it
is
not
nothing
to
you
and
it
is
a
matter
which
vitally
and
personally
touches
your
interest
that
to
your
in
south
africa
should
have
been
denied
the
elementary
rights
of
citizenship
and
the
common
privileges
of
humanity
the
injury
that
has
been
done
to
them
is
done
to
you
that
you
should
go
forth
in
a
right
and
reverent
spirit
is
the
prayer
of
all
who
worship
with
you
in
this
cathedral
is
it
hardly
like
to
suggest
the
is
it
possible
that
we
have
lately
thought
too
little
of
almighty
god
is
it
possible
that
we
have
entered
upon
the
war
with
something
like
levity
in
the
reliance
upon
our
army
and
upon
our
pecuniary
military
resources
rather
than
upon
him
who
has
made
and
sanctified
our
empire
is
it
possible
that
we
have
forgotten
that
even
if
the
is
prepared
against
the
day
of
yet
victory
is
of
the
lord
if
so
let
us
return
to
him
in
penitence
and
prayer
let
us
confess
our
many
failings
and
shortcomings
our
imperfect
sense
of
responsibility
to
providence
and
our
disloyalty
if
such
there
has
been
to
his
commands
may
you
go
forth
brethren
as
trusting
in
him
for
you
believe
that
your
cause
is
just
if
it
were
not
just
if
it
were
the
cause
of
oppression
or
aggrandisement
may
he
himself
forbid
that
it
should
prosper
but
if
it
be
his
will
to
use
you
in
his
service
to
make
you
the
instrument
of
his
providence
in
the
subjugation
and
pacification
of
the
country
which
has
flouted
the
majesty
of
the
british
empire
if
he
has
called
you
and
you
have
responded
to
his
call
then
his
blessing
will
abide
with
you
always
it
is
in
this
spirit
that
we
bid
you
an
honourable
farewell
it
may
be
that
when
you
are
severed
by
thousands
of
miles
of
ocean
from
the
country
of
your
birth
or
of
your
adoption
the
memory
of
this
service
shall
not
wholly
fade
from
your
hearts
here
in
india
where
the
majesty
of
the
empire
was
most
fiercely
assailed
and
most
successfully
in
this
cathedral
where
many
monuments
eloquently
remind
you
of
the
courage
faith
and
heroism
of
your
race
down
to
the
memorial
of
those
young
englishmen
who
laid
their
lives
down
for
their
country
saying
that
they
were
not
the
last
in
the
presence
of
the
power
which
controls
the
destinies
of
nations
we
invoke
the
divine
blessing
upon
your
arms
one
last
word
one
inspiring
motto
we
will
offer
you
it
is
the
watchword
of
our
race
it
is
thank
god

nelson
to
captain
blackwood
on
the
morning
of

and
i
will
do
our
that
the
thought
of
inspired
and

may
dwell
in
your
hearts
is
our
prayer
for
you
highest
prayer
that
man
may
offer
for
man
may
the
god
of
our
fathers
be
with
you
always
and
help
you
to
be
brave
generous
and
merciful
and
vouchsafe
to
you
safety
and
if
it
be
his
will
may
victory
and
peace
restore
you
to
those
who
love
you
so
well
at
home
or
in
india
and
grant
you
in
life
or
in
death
to
prove
yourselves
worthy
citizens
of
the
empire
faithful
servants
and
fellow
soldiers
of
jesus
christ
our
saviour
the
choir
next
sang
of
christ
arise
and
put
your
armour
on
and
this
was
followed
by
two
special
prayers
then
came
the
national
anthem
in
the
singing
of
which
the
whole
congregation
joined
and
then
the
recessional
hymn
all
the
saints
who
from
their
labours
the
service
over
horse
marched
back
to
camp
through
roads
that
were
thronged
with
enthusiastic
spectators
the
next
ten
days
were
crowded
with
necessary
preparations
that
left
the
men
little
leisure
for
enjoyment
of
social
entertainments
arranged
in
their
honour
yet
they
found
time
for
a
pleasant
gathering
as
spectators
at
an
amateur
performance
in
the
calcutta
theatre
and
possibly
for
some
tender
of
which
no
note
was
made
they
were
not
at
any
rate
allowed
to
go
away
without
many
manifestations
of
from
all
classes
and
abundant
proofs
of
appreciation
and
care
for
their
welfare
by
the
government
of
india
it
has
already
been
said
that
his
excellency
lord
curzon
accepted
readily
the
rank
of
honorary
colonel
of
the
corps
while
both
he
and
lady
curzon
took
every
possible
opportunity
of
identifying
themselves
with
a
force
in
which
they
continued
to
show
the
liveliest
personal
interest
throughout
its
career

active
service

then
was
lying
in
fort

calcutta
dangerously
ill
of
the
malady
from
which
he
died
not
long
afterwards
and
was
therefore
unable
to
see

he
sent
to

of

the

all
in
their

to
expedite
matters
and
to
meet
the
wishes
of

whose
one
anxiety
was
for
the
comfort
and
of
his
men
on
the
voyage
before
daybreak
on
monday
january
bugles
were
sounding
the

for

and
from
that
moment
its
camp
was
a
scene
of
liveliest
activity
though
the
men
whose
turn
to
embark
might
not
come
for
a
week
or
two
longer
went
about
their
ordinary
duties
with
assumed
unconcern
they
cast
many
wistful
glances
at
the
busy
preparations
of
their
envied
comrades
life
in
calcutta
had
been
pleasant
enough
to
make
parting
sweet
for
many
that
they
would
fain
have
prolonged
it
at
the
last
but
none
gave
a
thought
to
such
things
in
the
dawn
of
the
day
so
long
desired
for
them
all
south
africa
was
then
the
goal
of
hope
and
naturally
the
troops
to
go
first
were
deemed
most
fortunate
an
old
campaigner
might
have
told
them
of
the
days
to
come
when
in
the
weariness
of
a
realisation
more
hollow
than
their
dreams
they
would
be
haunted
by
the
music
of
that
last
waltz
in
calcutta
and
longing
to
hear
once
more
the
rustle
of
palm
fronds
under
soft
indian
skies
to
breathe
the
sweet
fragrance
of
oleanders
and
roses
these
thoughts
however
were
unspoken
and
if
anybody
had
ventured
to
hint
at
them
he
would
have
been
rightly
scouted
as
a
sickly
sentimentalist
by
horse
who
were
going
forth
to
do
the
work
of
men
yes
but
somehow
they
were
not
all
adamant
when
they
heard
the
cheers
of
thousands
greeting
them
as
they
marched
through
streets
crowded
with
europeans
and
natives
the
service
company
in
full
campaigning
kit
took
the
lead
proudly
conscious
that
all
this
was
meant
as
an
enthusiastic
farewell
to
them
and
for
the
gallant
colonel
at
their
head
and
b
company
followed
wearing
simple
drill
order
with
becoming
modesty
an
escort
of
ladies
and
gentlemen
on
horseback
accompanied
the
marching
contingent
so
uncontrollable
did
the
excitement
of
spectators
become
that
they
broke
in
upon
and
mingled
with
the
ranks
a
confused
mass
from
which
it
was
difficult
for
horse
to
disentangle
themselves
and
pass
in
any
semblance
of
military
formation
through
the
dock
gates
within
which
they
dismounted
embarkation
of
their
horses
would
in
ordinary
circumstances
have
occupied
a
whole
day
if
the
slow
system
of
hoisting
by
slings
had
been
adhered
to
major
taylor
however
suggested
the
use
of
gangways
ascending
by
easy
inclines

to
this
arrangement
the
broad
wharves

kidderpore
docks

captain
gwynne
with
a
ready
appreciation
of
proposals
consented
to
this
departure
from
former
methods
the
gangways
were
rigged
accordingly
and
so
the
horses
walked
quietly
up
the
slopes
to
their
berths
on
different
decks
instead
of
being
slung
on
board
in
the
barbarous
old
fashion
the
whole
operation
thus
took
an
hour
instead
of
a
day
and
not
a
single
horse
was
injured
or
had
its
temper
upset
while
horses
were
being
got
on
board
the
companies
drew
up
to
await
the
coming
where
burning
sunlight
fell
full
on
the
white
helmets
that
were
not
to
be
worn
again
for
many
a
day
all
their
march
from
the
maidan
had
been
like
a
triumphal
procession
to
the
accompaniment
of
cheers
and
waving
handkerchiefs
but
a
scene
even
more
inspiring
awaited
them
at
the
docks
where
a
great
crowd
had
assembled
making
the
grimy
wharves
bright
with
the
colours
of
dainty
costumes
people
lined
the
parapets
of
surrounding
houses
in
masses
uncomfortably
dense
and
a
multitude
thronged
the
jetty
alongside
which
the
transport
lay
waiting
to
receive
her
full
complement
of
troops
enclosures
reserved
for
favoured
spectators
were
filled
to
overflowing
and
at
least
of
the
number
assembled
there
had
to
stand
the
chairs

mostly
occupied

that
had
ever
left

fight
for

seemed
eager
to

something
that
might

the
heartiness
of
the
farewell

general

was
this
desire

with

the
while
this
inspection
over
his

returned
to

carried
far

attentive

addressed

colonel

officers

in
bidding
you
this
afternoon
i
feel
that
i
may
claim
to
speak
for
others
besides
myself
i
do
not
appear
here
merely
as
the
honorary
colonel
of
your
corps
proud
as
i
am
to
fill
that
position
nor
am
i
merely
the
spokesman
of
the
citizens
of
calcutta
european
and
native
among
whom
you
have
spent
the
past
few
weeks
and
who
desire
to
wish
you
all
success
in
your
patriotic
enterprise
i
feel
that
i
am
more
than
that
and
that
i
may
consider
myself
the
mouthpiece
of
public
opinion
throughout
india
which
has
watched
the
formation
of
this
corps
with
admiration
which
has
contributed
to
its
equipment
and
comfort
with
no
illiberal
hand
and
which
now
sends
you
forth
with
an
almost
parental
interest
in
your
fortunes
at
a
time
when
the
stress
of
a
common
anxiety
has
revealed
to
the
british
empire
its
almost
unsuspected
unity
and
its
illimitable
resources
in
loyalty
and
men
it
would
have
been
disappointing
to
all
of
us
if
india
had
lagged
which
even
if
it
is
only
peopled
by
a
small
minority
of
our
own
race
is
yet
the
noblest
field
of
british
activity
and
energy
and
devotion
that
the
world
can
show
already
the
british
regiments
that
we
have
sent
from
this
country
have
helped
to
save
natal
and
many
a
brave
native
follower
has
borne
his
part
in
the
struggle
but
as
soon
as
the
electric
call
for
volunteer
help
to
the
mother
land
ran
round
india
responded
to
the
summons
she
has
given
us
from
the
small
civil
population
of
british
birth
the
gallant
men
whom
i
am
now
addressing
and
she
would
have
given
us
as
many
more
as
government
would
have
been
prepared
to
accept
i
doubt
not
that
had
we
been
willing
to
enrol
instead
of
they
would
have
been
forthcoming
and
that
had
not
one
thousand
but
many
thousand
volunteers
been
called
for
from
the
native
races
who
vie
with
us
in
fervent
loyalty
to
the
same
sovereign
they
would
have
sprung
joyfully
to
arms
from
the
hindu
or
mussulman
chief
of
ancient
lineage
and
great
possessions
to
the
martial
sikh
or
the
fighting
pathan
you
however
are
the
who
have
been
chosen
the
first
body
of
volunteers
from
india
that
have
ever
had
the
chance
of
fighting
for
the
queen
outside
their
shores

you
colonel

patriotic

you
carry
a
great

with

fall
to
you
in
the

perhaps
even
in
the
face
of

sustain
the
honour
of
the

that
is
now
sending
you
forth
and
of
the
race
from

you
are
sprung
but
you
will
have
this
consolation
you
are
engaged
on
a
glorious
and
as
i
believe
a
righteous
mission
not
to
aggrandise
an
empire
not
merely
to
repel
an
unscrupulous
invasion
of
the
territories
but
to
plant
liberty
and
justice
and
equal
rights
upon
the
soil
of

henceforward
to
be
united
under
the
british

no

you
go
out
at
a
dramatic
moment
in
the
contest
when
owing
to
the
skilful
generalship
of
an
old
indian
soldier
and
and
to
the
indomitable
gallantry
of
our
men
the
tide
of
fortune
which
has
too
long
flowed
against
us
seems
at
last
to
have
turned
in
our
favour
may
it
carry
you
on
its
forward
crest
to
pretoria

all
india
applauds
your
bravery
in

shall
watch
your

on
the

on

we
wish
you
god
speed
in
your
undertaking
and
may
providence
in
his
mercy
protect
you
through
the
perils
and
vicissitudes
of
your
first
contact
with
the
dread
realities
of

and
bring
you
safely
back
again

the
viceroy
addressing
the

there
is
ample
evidence
from
the
letters
of
troopers
themselves
to
prove
that

eloquent
words
inspired
them
with
an
ideal
which
they
determined
at
all
hazards
to
live
up
to
and
perhaps
it
is
not
too
much
to
say
that
the
conspicuous
gallantry
everywhere
and
at
all
times
displayed
by
all
ranks
of
horse
is
directly
traceable
to
the
high
conception
of
their
duty
breathed
in
every
sentence
of
the
speech

they
paraphrased
it
in
more
homely
language
taking
for
their
regimental
motto
the

a
while
after
lord
curzon
had
finished
speaking

troops
were
silent

they
raised
lusty
cheers
for
his
excellency
and
lady
curzon
and
the
people
of
calcutta

in
their
turn
cheered

in
giving
it
she
said
a
few
simple
words
that
touched
all
hearts
some
tender
scenes
of

been
enacted
and
men
came
back
to
their
places
in
the
ranks
with
faces
not
quite
so
hard
as
they
thought
there
may
have
been
sobs
in
the
sweet
voices
that
whispered
but
if
so
they
were
lost
in
the
loud
chorus
that
rang
out
from
comrades
cheering
each

lingered

morning
of

major

in

of
all
that
remained
of
horse
on
the
maidan
marched
out

escorted
by
europeans
and
natives
principally
on
horseback
for
them
the
enthusiasm
that
had
marked
the
departure
of
their
comrades
was
revived
with
even
greater
fervour
and
though
this
second
was
less
ceremonious
than
the
first
it
lacked
nothing
of
the
eloquence
that
rings
through
the
voices
of
people
when
they
are
moved
by
great
impulses
the
viceroy
when
he
addressed

a
company
had
spoken
his
farewell
to
the
whole
regiment
this
second
demonstration
though
accompanied
by
many
signs
of
official
interest
was
in
all
essential
characteristics
a
popular
movement
in
which
all
classes
joined
with
the
more
impressive
warmth
because
it
was
the
last
tribute
they
could
pay
to
horse
before
the

might
be
called
upon
to
take
its
place
in
the
fighting
line
the
sir
john
woodburn

the
bishop
of

made
eloquent
speeches
that
were
emphasised
by
repeated
cheering

with
many
cordial
words

farewell
ringing

had
laboured
with
patriotic
to
raise
and
equip
horse
and
send
the
contingent
forth
a
perfectly
organised
force
in
all
respects
the

practically

its

never
ceased
for

to
watch
over
the
interests
of

my
dear

ever

i
never
half
thanked
you
for
what
you
did
for
horse
and
no
one
knows
so
well
as
myself
or
appreciates
more
to
the
full
the
work
you
did
on
its
behalf
now
when
i
have
time
to
think
calmly
over
the
events
of
the
past
two
months
i
can
see
plainly
that
the
successful
issue
things
were
brought
to
financially
and
otherwise
was
entirely
due
to
your
energy
and
guidance
and
this
without
in
the
slightest
degree
depreciating
the
valuable
services
of
your
on
the

as
i
feel
confident

all

chapter

life
on
board
a
troopship
does
not
offer
much
material
for
graphic
description
and
none
but
a

could
give
to
its
ordinary
incidents
an
absorbing
interest
for
general
readers
nevertheless
it
has
charms
for
those
who
look
at
it
with
eyes
fresh
to
such
scenes
and
for
horse
at
any
rate
there
was
a
novelty
in
the
situation
not
wholly
unpleasant
in
spite
of
the
many
discomforts
they
had
to
endure
and
the
distasteful
duties
necessarily
imposed
upon
them
they
were
learning
there
a
harder
lesson
than
any
of
which
their
experiences
in
camp
on
the
maidan
could
have
given
the
slightest
conception
it
is
one
thing
to
go
a
long
voyage
on
board
a
liner
as
or
even
passenger
but
quite
another
to
be
penned
up
between
decks
in
a
crowded
transport
with
native
servants
and
lascars
eating
coarse
government
rations
served
in
the
roughest
fashion
doing
the
work
of
grooms
and
lackeys
and
sleeping
on
bare
planks
in
an
atmosphere
odorous
with
exhalations
from
stables
and
galleys
they
had
enlisted
for
a
life
however
prepared
to
take
the
rough
with
the
smooth
and
being
in
for
it
they
made
the
best
of
their
circumstances
after
the
first
rude
shock
of
feeling
what
military
service
really
means
had
worn
off
discipline
may
become
a
property
of
easiness
anywhere
else
but
on
board
ship
the
line
that
separates
rank
from
rank
must
be
sharply
drawn
even
in
the
case
of
a
volunteer
company
comradeship
and
interchange
of
friendly
greetings
between
officers
and
men
may
still
go
on
as
of
old
but
they
can
not
make
a
trooper
forget
for
a
moment
that
certain
privileges
follow
rank
and
disabilities
cling
to
those
who
have
it
not
while
these
facts
are
thrust
upon
him
insistently
at
every
turn
and
dinned
into
his
ears
by
every
bugle
call
to
duty
or
to
meals
it
is
well
that
we
also
should
remember
these
things
in
estimating
the
sacrifices
that
volunteers
make
when
they
give
up
the
comforts
if
not
luxuries
of
home
life
and
go
forth
to
fight
for
country
and
for
empire
as
private
soldiers
the
privations
the
rough
fare
the
hard
marches
in
all
weather
exposure
to
rapid
alternations
of
heat
and
cold
fierce
sunshine
where
there
is
no
shelter
by
day
and
pitiless
rain
from
which
there
is
no
escape
at
night
hunger
wounds
and
these
may
be
cheerfully
borne
because
they
are
the
lot
of
all
ranks
alike
not
so
however
with
the
petty
humiliations
and
drudgery
inseparable
from
many
duties
on
board
a
transport
where
the
mere
trooper
finds
that
a
uniform
is
a
badge
of
distinction
truly
but
the
distinction
at
times
brings
with
it
something
closely
akin
to
a
sense
of
humiliation
the
company
or
regimental
officers
may
do
all
they
can
to
take
the
keen
point
off
this
goading
sentiment
but
it
will
wound
where
there
is
the
least
protection
against
it
and
rankle
too
one
must
say
to
the
credit
of
horse
that
they
did
not
allow
such
considerations
to
trouble
there
is
no
trace
of
discontent
in
their
published
contributions
to
indian
papers
of
which
some
extracts
from
the
may
be
made
by
way
of
giving
a
picture
of
the
voyage

troopers
looked
at
it
we
left
the
steaming
down
the
hugli
apparently
well
on
her
way
towards
south
africa
though
lost
to
the
view
of
interested
crowds
who
looked
for
her
soon
after
dawn
on
the
morning
of
february
she
did
not
pursue
an
uninterrupted
course
at
this
point
a
trooper
of
a
company
takes
up
the
story
in
a
lively
narrative
writing
thus
the
absurd
antics
which
the
river
hugli
thinks
it
necessary
to
go
through
ere
flowing
to
rest
in
the
bosom
of
its
old
mammy
ocean
compel
mariners
to
sail
on
it
by
day
alone
and
then
to
go
as
cannily
as
a
cat
on
hot
bricks
on
tuesday
morning
we
dashed
off
letters
and
telegrams
and
with
a
sigh
of
relief
despatched
them
by
the
post
boat
thinking
we
were
fairly
off
for
sandy
shores
but
no
we
had
not
reckoned
with
the
lead
line
which
recorded
much
the
same
number
of
feet
and
inches
that
the
good
ship
drew
so
with
a
heave
ho
holly
the
anchor
fell
overboard
and
then
we
were
stuck
for
a
whole
day
fancy
getting
up
at
in
the
pitch
dark
and
no
chance
of
shirking
either
for
the
decks
are
swabbed
down
and
clean
as
a
plate
after
a
penny
dinner
by
of
the
clock
heralds
a
cup
of
tea
and
sets
every
nag
aboard

breakfast

at

wax
busy
and
call
after
call
resounds
through
the
ship
summoning
sections
to
various
tasks
one
of
the
earliest
parades
of
the
voyage
was
that
to
practise
the
fire
alarm
and
every
man
has
his
appointed
place
and
lest
any
should
hurry
unduly
for
the
boats
sentries
have
been
told
off
to
guard
these
having
their
rifles
loaded
with
ball
cartridges
and
orders
to
shoot
the
first
man
who
may
attempt
a
rush
this
extremely
important
matter
has
been
thoroughly
impressed
on
our
minds
by
practice
and
should
the
alarm
be
given
in
stern
reality
we
all
know
where
to
make
for
needless
to
say
rifle
exercise
is
one
of
the
chief
things
to
which
we
must
pay
attention
and
morning
and
afternoon
the
words
of
command
ring
through
the
ship
as
squad
after
squad
is
put
through
its
facings
fatigues
are
innumerable
bringing
forage
and
stores
on
deck
is
a
daily
task
oiling
and
packing
away
saddlery
cleaning
spare
arms
painting
side
arms
marking
equipment
and
a
dozen
other
things
then
a
signalling
class
is
terribly
busy
and
a
row
of
otherwise
lads
wave
their
arms
wildly
to
the
accompaniment
of
strange
sounds
bellowed
by
the
signalling
instructor
when
the
rifle
exercises
have
sunk
into
the
minds
of
men
they
are
allowed
to
practise
shooting
every
day
at
and
parties
assemble
on
the
and
shoot
at
wine
cases
biscuit
boxes
bits
of
paper
anything
that
affords
a
mark
in
spite
of
the
rolling
and
pitching
of
the
ship
and
what
is
worse
the
vibration
caused
by
the
screw
wonderful
practice
is
made
a
bit
of
paper
a
few
inches
square
is
hit
several
times
at
yards
and
as
the
larger
obstacles
recede
they
are
repeatedly
struck
men
firing
have
to
judge
their
own
distances
and
the
practice
on
the
whole
has
been
marvellously
good
the
maxim
gun
has
had
a
turn
too
and
a
very
terrible
weapon
it
is
in
spite
of
the
extreme
disadvantage
under
which
it
labours
when
placed
on
a
moving
platform
excellent
shooting
has
been
made
with
it
an
ordinary
beer
barrel
at
and
yards
was
douched
with
spray
and
then
struck
after
three
or
four
shots
had
been
fired
the
noise
is
atrocious
but
it
is
grand
to
see
the
bullets
striking
the
water
one
two
three
four
ever
nearing
the
mark
and
then
five
plump
in
though
we
have
lots
of
work
to
do
we
forget
to
play
and
many
are
the
tasks
indulged
in
one
of
the
favourite
amusements
is
boxing
and
morning
and
evening
a
ring
is
formed
wherein
all
may
enter
for
a
round
or
two
a
few
matches
have
been
got
up
and
desperate
battles
have
been
fought
betwixt
champions
of
the
various
sections

high
on
these
occasions
and
everybody
in
the

from
the
colonel
and
the
captain
down
to
carpenter
chinaman
john
takes
up
a
place
outside
the
ring
watching
the
fray
with
bated
breath
the
end
is
usually
a
black
eye
or
blood
drawn

of
which
temporary
inconveniences
prevents
furious
and
friendly
handshakings

the
finish

during

we
passed
in

distance
a
light
which
shone
out
from

on

was
our

sight

of
sorts
every

an
walking
exercise

twice
in

is

to
behold
an
animal
with

puffed
out
like

begin
his
little
tour
and
finish
up
with
extremities
clean
cut
as
those

plaintively
remonstrates

when
any

join
him
in
a
cigar
and

the
stump
out

on

comprehension
how
can

paid

but
none
that
gives
a
better
key
to
the
hold
he
had
on
their
respect
than
his
own
simple
words
as
they
appear
in
the
following
extract
i
regret
to
say
hickley
from
behar
is
in
a
very
bad
way
he
had
fever
and
pneumonia
to
start
with
and
has
now
gone
clean
and
though
quite
quiet
and
harmless
has
to
have
two
men
in
close
attendance
day
and
night
i
had
him
taken
into
the
saloon
yesterday
in
a
cabin
near
my
own
i
am
intensely
sorry
for
the
poor
chap
as
unless
a
sudden
recovery
takes
place
we
shall
have
to
make
arrangement
for
the
authorities
to
look
after
him
when
we
land
we
have
one
more
case
on
board
which
i
was
in
hopes
it
might
not
be
necessary
to
mention
stewart
the
planter
from
mysore
had
an
attack
of
pneumonia
which
has
taken
a
chronic
form
and
i
fear
there
is
small
chance
of
immediate
recovery
he
may
have
to
go
into
hospital
at
we
land
there
or
i
much
doubt
his
ever
being
able
to
join
us
again
you
will
remember
my
telling
you
about
him
a
man
of
independent
means
married
with
a
family
who
came
for
the
love
of
the
game
he
was
a
most
useful
man
knowing
a
lot
about
horses
and
was
made
an
acting
sergeant
almost
as
soon
as
he
arrived
and
put
on
to
help
stevenson
he
did
excellent
work
on
board
until
he
got
ill
and
i
shall
miss
him
much
it
is
his
own
wish
to
land
if
he
is
not
better
beyond
this
we
have
had
a
most
delightful
voyage
simply
perfect
weather
and
a
sea
like
glass
the
men
act
up
to
our
corps
motto
the
like
the
good
chaps
they
are
you
should
see
them
at
stable
work
in
the
morning
with
nothing
on
but
trousers
rolled
up
to
their
thighs
or
pyjamas
ditto
and
later
in
the
day
washing
their
kit
or
making
up
puddings
and
cakes
of
of
the
latter
are
works
of
art
we
have
a
lot
of
musical
talent
on
board
and
have
had
a
couple
of
excellent
concerts
captain
steuart
added
to
the
enjoyment
of

by
giving
a
show
he
is
a
very
good
sort
and
has
done
everything
in
his
power
to
ensure
the
comfort
of
the
men
after
finishing
our
daily
inspection
he
confided
to
me
that
he
had
never
seen
a
troopship
better
kept
as
regards
order
and
cleanliness
the
men
are
being
practised
daily
in
the
use
of
the
rifle
dropping
boxes
and
wisps
of
straw
overboard
for

and
i
am
more
than
pleased
with
the
way
they
are

this
is
one
picture
of

in

under

happiest
conditions
there
is
another
side
to
the
picture
of
which
we
may
get
glimpses
in
the
experiences
of
men
in
company
b
to
whom
citizens
gave
a
hearty
when
they
embarked
in
the
at
kidderpore
docks
on
march
before
she
had
cast
off
from
her
moorings
the
troopers
had
been
called
to
dinner
and
that
feast
was
a
revelation
to
them
of
all
they
were
leaving
behind
one
corporal
described
it
as
sort
of
stew
in
too
filthy
for
but
that
may
have
been
merely
a
little
ebullition
of
aristocratic
prejudice
nevertheless
he
and
two
comrades
hurried
on
shore
and
drove
as
fast
as
they
could
to
in
the
town
where
they
invested
rupees
in
sundry
things
which
they
regarded
as
necessaries
for
their
sustenance
during
the
voyage
they
were
back
in
time
to
hear
the
and
bishop
speeches
and
then
to
join
in
a
parting
cheer
for
their
old
adjutant
captain
martin
who
only
left
them
to
go
on
shore
as
the
cast
off
the
subsequent
proceedings
of
that
day
are
not
recorded
in
the
diary
who
contents
himself
with
noting
that
he
some
milk
and
awfully
when
he
awoke
next
morning
after
a
restless
night
on
bare
planks
between
decks
the
thought
of
must
have
been
uppermost
still
for
he
was
aware
of
of
nothing
to
eat
and
his
morning
reflections
begin
with
the
disjointed
phrases
knives
and
forks
no
salt
those
who
had
penknives
were
lucky
fortunately
we
all
had
was
there
in
those
last
words
a
prophetic
suggestion
that
some
of
them
might
not
even
have
fingers
for
such
uses
after
a
while
if
so
the
gloomy
foreboding
passed
without
record
giving
place
to
action
for
at
that
morning
the
corporal
whose
notes
throw
a
glimmer
of
light
on
much
of
the
darker
side
that
is
too
often
ignored
found
himself
in
charge
of
a
stable
fatigue
wading
at
the
heels
of
the
horses
in
a
foul
dark
unventilated
drain
about
thirty
inches
wide
from
which
nothing
ran
off
he
mentions
incidentally
that
the
four
unfortunate
men
who
had
to
clear
away
this
accumulated
filth
were
and
from
this
we
may
gather
that
they
used
adjectives
to
express
their
opinion
of
that
first
stable
fatigue
on
board
ship
it
does
not
read
like
the
best
possible
means
of
promoting
a
healthy
appetite
but
when
called
to
breakfast
three
hours
later
they
looked
with
dismay
at
a
loaf
that
was
to
last
each
of
them
the
whole
day
and
when
one
small
tin
of
brawn
was
put
before
them
for
division
among
sixteen
men
at
a
table
they
came
to
the
conclusion
that
it
very
short
commons
some
of
the
men
found
that
their
kits
had
been
thrown
aside
in
a
confused
heap
to
make
room
for
native
followers
and
they
ventured
on
a
mild
remonstrance
but
were
told
must
look
after
your
own
things
you
have
your
bearers
that
obvious
truth
had
impressed
itself
upon
them
very
forcibly
some
hours
earlier
while
they
were
doing
stable
fatigue
and
it
needed
no
rubbing
in
other
trials
followed
as
we
gather
from
a
brief
but
expressive
note
at
soup
and
a
messy
stew
in
buckets
as
before
tried
to
get
some
salt
unsuccessfully
and
returning
found
the
stew
all
gone
beer
was
served
out
which
i
drink
gave
my
bottle
away
and
drank
water
hot
and
cloudy
out
of
a
no
knives
or
forks
yet
through
our
while
we
feed
files
a
long
procession
of
syces
transport
wallahs
servants
candaharis
sometimes
a
herd
of
goats
and
always
lascars
carrying
ropes
hoses
or
buckets
now
they
have
kicked
us
out
from
where
we
were
making
ourselves
comfortable
below
and
i
miss
much
a
corner
even
such
as
my
horse
has
where
i
could
put
my
things
in
safety
at
night
we
throw
our
straw
mattresses
wherever
we
can
find
a
vacant
space
and
scramble
in
confusion
for
our
kits
out
of
a
heap
of
exactly
similar
ones
we
would
gladly
have
paid
our
own
expenses
for
a
little
more
comfort
the
last
straw
came
at
when
the
bugle
went
again
but
the
said
orders
to
cook
anything
more
and
shut
the
door
in
the
faces
of
orderlies
the
then
went
in
a
body
and
complained
and
beer
were
served
out
it
was
bread
and
water
for
me
lay
my
mattress
down
among
the
horses
and
was
comfortable
in
spite
of
the
stuffy
smell
and
stamping
about
all
still
his
thoughts
seem
to
have
dwelt
on
the
idea
that
there
was
much
to
complain
coarse
tin
pots
the
tea
extremely
sweet
and
without
milk
the
hot
and
dirty
even
a
dry
canteen
from
which
to
supplement
the
scanty
fare
and
so
on
until
he
dropped
into
sweet
sleep
that
sleep
must
have
been
very
refreshing
or
a
considerable
change
had
come
upon
the
ship
by
the
next
morning
when
the
food
had
improved
greatly
and
at
supper
the
were
merry
enough
with
great
singing
of
later
entries
in
this
diary
show
that
the
first
outbursts
of
discontent
were
due
mainly
if
not
wholly
to
a
sudden
change
from
the
luxury
and
plenty
of
a
to
the
comparative
coarseness
of
a
simple
government
necessarily
rough
circumstances
the
additional
comforts
thoughtfully
provided
by
the
calcutta
committee
for
consumption
on
the
voyage
were
by
mistake
stowed
away
with
baggage
and
other
stores
below
thenceforward
matters
mended
day
by
day
and
though
there
were
still
some
discomforts
to
be
endured
they
seem
to
have
been
relieved
by
more
amusements
than
appear
in
the
letters
sent
for
publication
to
the
indian
newspapers
on
the
whole
however
a
fairly
comprehensive
idea
of
the
way
in
which
b
company
passed
its
days
on
board
the
may
be
formed
from
the
following
letter
parts
of
which
were
published
in
the
daily
illustration

b
company
hard
work
and
plenty
of
it
has
been
the
order
of
the
day
ever
since
we
came
on
board
the
greater
part
of
this
is
in
connection
with
the
horses
it
is
of
course
of
very
great
importance
that
we
should
be
in
a
position
to
move
forward
as
soon
as
possible
after
landing
and
bearing

in
mind

doing
their

to
keep
the

for
the
first

or
two
bran
mashes
were
given
the
horses
with
as
much
hay
as
they
could
eat
this
has
been
gradually
augmented
until
they
are
now
getting
a
mixture
of
bran
and

or
linseed
three
times
a

the

and
feeding
are
carried
out
with

our

prove
interesting
to
the

have
time
to
put
our

in

before
getting
a

an
hour
later
the

sounds
and
the

immediately
assemble

is
taken
out
of
his
stall
and
thoroughly
groomed
and
the

itself
cleaned

disinfected
daily
the

are
then
watered
a

at
every
night

and
half
an
hour
later
after
that
is
naught
but
the
sound
of
the
lone

the
squeal

angry
horse

disturb
the
peaceful
slumbers

went
wrong
with
the

which
had
to
be
stopped
twice
for

covered
the
remaining
fifteen
hundred

was
within

of
the

coast
by
daybreak
of
the
and
at
midday
she
anchored
off
durban
being
unable
to
get
nearer
that
port
than
the
troubled
roadstead
two
miles
from
shore
thus
her
time
from
the
hugli
to
port
natal
was
just
three
weeks
and
those
on
board
had
the
satisfaction
of
hearing
that
the
with
a
company
must
be
still
at
sea
having
left
durban
for
cape
town
only
three
days
before
the
arrival
the
man
who
brought
that
good
news
had
evidently
acquired
a
kaffir
or
oriental
habit
of
saying
the
things
that
are
pleasant
whether
true
or
not
in
sober
fact
the
had
gone
a
week
earlier
and
was
by
that
time
landing
her
troops
at
cape
town
as
nobody
was
allowed
to
land
horse
did
not
get
the
exciting
experience
of
being
lowered
in
a
cage
from
the
gangway
to
a
tug
plunging
and
tossing
and
wriggling
among
the
twenty
feet
below
but
they
had
an
opportunity
of
seeing
how
the
thing
was
done
when
a
transport
officer
came
on
board
that
way
with
an
order
for
the
troops
under
major
command
to
disembark
at
east
london
this
officer
was
accompanied
by
three
of
the
natal
carbineers
who
had
been
with
sir
redvers
force
to
the
relief
of
ladysmith
and
whose
thrilling
tales
of
adventure
were
as
welcome
as
a
series
of
arabian
stories
might
have
been
to
men
who
had
heard
no
news
for
days
the
general
situation
was
not
quite
as
those
carbineers
described
it
but
their
account
of
boer
resistance
in
natal
did
not
by
any
means
convey
the
idea
that
war
was
nearly
at
an
end
although
rumour
magnified
lord
successes
to
the
extent
of
placing
him
within
a
march
or
so
of
kroonstadt
at
a
time
when
his
troops
were
still
hung
up
at
bloemfontein
waiting
for
food
and
transport
as
b
company
had
heard
of
surrender
and
the
relief
of
ladysmith
before
leaving
calcutta
it
would
hardly
have
surprised
them
to
learn
that
the
union
jack
was
floating
over
pretoria
to
them
the
mere
occupation
of
bloemfontein
seemed
a
comparatively
small
matter
so
they
at
once
turned
and
began
to
rend
with
keen
sarcasm
the
croakers
who
had
predicted
that
b
company
at
least
would
be
too
late
for
anything
too
late
why
their
orders
were
to
disembark
at
east
london
and
did
not
that
mean
an
immediate
start
for
the
front
one
sanguine
trooper
in
the
gladness
of
his
heart
wrote
go
on
shore
at
leaving
for
bloemfontein
by
train
about
the
same
hour
and
expect
to
arrive
in
hours
we
shall
probably
train
to
bethulie
and
march
from
there
to
bloemfontein
about
his
faith
in
the
marching
powers
of
horse
must
have
been
great
indeed
if
he
thought
they
could
trek
miles
across
unknown
veldt
after
travelling
from
east
london
to
bethulie
by
rail
and
all
in
the
space
of
hours
there
is
something
very
fascinating
about
that
picture
of
troopers
so
eager
to
be
at
the
taking
of
kroonstadt
it
would
seem
will
be
a
big
that
they
would
perform
superhuman
feats
to
be
there
in
time
no
admirer
of
horse
would
venture
to
suggest
that
a
march
of
forty
leagues
in
less
than
two
days
was
beyond
the
compass
of
their
powers
but
the
man
must
be
brimful
of
hope
who
could
believe
that
there
would
be
any
time
left
for
marching
or
any
inclination
to
march
left
in
the
men
after
a
south
african
railway
working
under
war
pressure
had
done
with
them
but
in
fact
there
was
no
such
need
for
haste
b
company
was
quite
in
time
for
the
at
kroonstadt
though
it
took
more
than
twenty
times
hours
in
the
getting
there
colonel
lumsden
going
ahead
with
a
company
to
land
in
cape
town
had
still
more
reason
for
entertaining
sanguine
views
though
in
his
case
they
were
modified
by
a
fuller
knowledge
of
events
when
in
sight
of
table
mountain
he
added
a
postscript
to
his
letter
cape
just
got
orders
may
be
in
for
pretoria
hope
the
two
companies
however
were
not
fortunate
enough
to
come
together
under
one
command
until
nearly
a
month
later
their
fortunes
as
separated
units
must
therefore
be
dealt
with
in
somewhat
disjointed
form
still
how
a
company
fared
after
casting
anchor
off
durban
may
be
told
in
the
words
of
a
special
correspondent
pf
the
who
had
joined
the
corps
for
active
service
as
we
came
in
sight
of
durban
everybody
was
expecting
that
some
official
would
dash
on
board
directly
he
knew
it
was
horse
to
order
us
off
down
the
coast
and
that
in
a
minute
we
should
be
steaming
hard
for
our
destination
but
it
happened
otherwise
when
fairly
close
in
we
signalled
to
the
coastguard
station
what
ship
we
were
and
what
she
contained
then
a
deep
silence
settled
over
things
lots
of
shipping
lay
at
anchor
there
and
every
ship
except
ours
had
a
steam
launch
calling
upon
it
but
we
waiting
with
beating
hearts
had
no
one
to
pay
us
a
visit
until
a
great
puffing
rolling
tug
bore
alongside
churned
up
the
blue
water
into
white
foam
dropped
a
tiny
boat
and
in
a
jiffy
a
gentleman
was
on
board
and
the
tug
had
gone
away
over
the
waters
so
we
thought
that
meant
orders
to
bring
us
ashore
but
alas
it
was
only
a
pilot
come
aboard
to
have
a
buck
with
the
captain
then
while
we
waited
and
waited
our
signalling
class
set
to
work
and
an
energetic
waving
of
arms
and
little
flags
elicited
the
reply
from
neighbouring
ships
that
ladysmith
had
been
relieved
they
also
confirmed
the
news
which
we
had
received
at
the
sandheads
of
surrender
close
by
lay
from
which
a
naval
contingent
had
been
sent
with
her
big
guns
to
reinforce
sir
redvers
buller
on
the
tugela
and
our
first
sight
of
one
of
the
consequences
of
war
was
a
launch
full
of
wounded
bluejackets
returning
to
their
ship
after
relieving
ladysmith
while
we
lay
peacefully
swinging
at
anchor
a
great
white
ship
flying
the
stars
and
stripes
and
union
jack
steamed
slowly
out
of
the
harbour
and
swung
off
to
the
left
as
she
passed
a
big
transport
the
troops
on
board
broke
into
ringing
cheers
and
when
she
neared
us
those
with
glasses
read
her
name
it
was
the
full
of
wounded
soldiers
from
sir
george
gallant
garrison
she
went
right
round
the
harbour
visiting
all
the
ships
with
troops
last
of
all
she
came
to
us
and
as
she
passed
by
and
we
could
see
the
nurses
and
the
bandaged
figures
with
pale
faces
we
gave
them
three
times
three
and
still
cheered
again
for
the
plucky
ladies
who
had
come
all
the
way
from
america
to
care
for
our
wounded
the
poor
chaps
aboard
did
their
best
to
answer
our
cheers
and
then
the
steamed
away
down
the
coast
on
her
way
home
to
england
however
the
came
at
last
and
a
great
shout
broke
forth
when
it
was
announced
that
we
were
ordered
to
proceed
to
cape
town
we
sat
down
to
dinner
at
and
as
we
toasted
ould
oireland
because
day
the
anchor
heaved
and
the
screw
that
for
twenty
days
had
toiled
without
ceasing
began
its
unremitting
task
again
when
morning
broke
we
had
steamed
well
down
the
coast
passing
the
lights
of
east
london
in
the
night
ten
miles
away
was
the
seashore
bare
and
uninteresting
but
still
the
africa
that
we
had
come
some
six
thousand
miles
to
argue
about
with
the
redoubtable
boers
and
now
we
had
to
reckon
with
a
foe
that
used
no
weapons
nor
fought
with
hands
this
was
mother
ocean
who
must
have
been
troubled
in
her
mind
for
her
breast
heaved
and
tossed
and
our
good
ship
rolled
better
change
the
subject
the
coast
slipped
by
and
on
the
forenoon
of
the
we
sighted
afar
off
the
flat
top
of
table
mountain
steaming
across
the
wide
mouth
of
bay
we
saw
hundreds
of
brutes
that
scooted
away
showing
a
black
fin
as
the
steamer
ploughed
her
way
through
the
waves
then
rounding
the
point
we
sailed
into
table
bay
and
dropped
anchor
with
a
grand
feeling
of
satisfaction
that
the
voyage
had
ended
journeying
by
sea
is
pleasant
enough
when
you
do
it
first
class
by
and
but
when
you
go
no
class
at
all
and
sleep
on
the
deck
and
get
turned
out
before
and
spend
a
big
part
of
the
day
clearing
out
horse
stalls
or
cooking
your
own
food
and
enduring
lots
of
other
discomforts
no
catch
at
all
and
it
was
with
intense
relief
we
took
our
place
among
the
lines
of
troopships
in
cape
town
harbour
and
what
a
sight
it
was
ships
ships
ships
and
everywhere
more
ships
and
most
of
them
transports
from
great
white
star
atlantic
liners
down
to
little
coasters
like
our
own
all
around
us
were
vessels
full
of
troops
every
hour
or
two
a
new
one
came
in
or
one
weighed
her
anchor
and
steamed
slowly
by
into
the
dock
to
disembark
her
living
freight
other
ships
were
crammed
from
stem
to
stern
with
cattle
sheep
horses
leaving
barely
enough
room
on
deck
to
turn
the
wheel
vessels
were
packed
like
herrings
in
the
harbour
so
thick
did
they
lie
in
places
you
could
hardly
see
the
water
for
ships
there
we
waited
and
next
morning
the
health
officer
came
on
board
and
gave
us
which
meant
a
clean
bill
of
health
and
freedom
to
land
another
day
of
waiting
for
the
pilot
then
after
a
great
rush
and
scurry
collecting
kit
we
slowly
slid
into
harbour
and
lo
and
behold
it
was
cape
at
last
disembarking
is
not
a
pleasant
pastime
especially
when
men
have
had
three
weeks
in
a
ship
during
which
to
lose
and
mix
up
their
belongings
but
the
order
to
clear
out
and
make
room
for
another
ship
was
given
and
had
to
be
obeyed
in
a
hurry
so
we
said
to
the
poor
thing
she
had
done
her
best
for
us
though
in
her
we
lost
four
of
our
chargers
and
two
transport
ponies
a
big
proportion
of
our
total
of
animals
but
nothing
like
the
number
that
died
on
some
other
ships
a
transport
lying
near
us
with
imperial
yeomanry
lost
out
of
in
a
three
all
from
pneumonia
our
orders
were
to
proceed
to
maitland
camp
some
four
miles
to
the
north
of
cape
town
and
thither
we
marched
leading
the
horses
which
of
course
were
hardly
in
a
fit
state
to
ride
however
the
walk
seemed
to
do
them
good
and
after
a
week
in
camp
with
good
feeding
and
gentle
exercise
they
picked
up
condition
rapidly
the
men
have
little
that
is
good
to
say
of
maitland
camp
it
is
a
place
stale
flat
unprofitable
and
altogether
accursed
when
we
arrived
the
wind
blew
a
hurricane
and
setting
up
the
tents
was
a
task
to
try
a
stoic
once
they
were
up
the
sand
crept
in
at
every
crevice
and
lay
thickly
on
everything
especially
butter
and
food
of
every
sort
men
went
to
sleep
or
tried
to
with
the
feeling
that
the
bit
of
the
earth
on
which
they
lay
must
surely
be
swept
into
the
next
world
ere
morning
broke
but
day
dawned
and
we
were
still
in
maitland
camp
with
the
rain
pouring
in
torrents
and
turning
the
sand
and
earth
into
mud
puddings
which
clogged
and
wetted
and
dirtied
every
scrap
that
belonged
to
us
however
the
third
day
recompensed
us
for
the
sun
shone
hot
and
bright
and
a
gentle
breeze
wafted
delicious
scents
from
the
woods
of
eucalyptus
and
fir
trees
all
around
boys
came
to
us
with
delicious
grapes
great
bunches
weighing
one
to
two
pounds
apiece
each
grape
being
as
large
as
a
egg
and
as
full
of
juice
and
flavour
as
fruit
can
be
of
cape
town
we
saw
very
little
but
liked
that
little
much
only
the
price
of
things
is
terrible
and
it
seems
much
more
serious
parting
with
shillings
than
with
rupees
horse
had
many
eyes
for
the
beautiful
and
while
declining
to
play
the
part
of
paris
in
deciding
on
rival
charms
they
wax
eloquent
when
their
theme
is
the
sex
which
as
one
gallant
trooper
says
has
done
much
to
make
this
world
the
habitable
place
it
is
in
cape
town
the
ladies
are
charming
to
look
at
they
dress
just
as
they
do
at
home
in
summer
and
their
cheeks
are
rosy
and
they
are
altogether
delightful
to
look
upon
but
still
it
matters
little
whether
the
cheeks
be
pale
or
rosy
we
are
all
ready
to
back
our
ladies
of
india
against
any
in
the
wide
world
for
kindness
and
every
other
feminine
attribute
having
inspected
our
transport
the
army
service
corps
officers
at
cape
town
approved
of
our
carts
and
reported
favourably
on
them
to
lord
roberts
but
at
the
same
time
stated
that
they
considered
a
team
of
two
ponies
inadequate
to
draw
the
load
we
had
designed
through
sandy
tracts
and
suggested
two
leaders
to
each
cart
an
increase
of
lb
in
the
load
and
a
decrease
in
the
number
of
carts
the
chief
of
the
staff
having
approved
of
this
suggestion
we
handed
over
to
the
military
authorities
twenty
ponies
not
our
best
and
ten
carts
and
harness
complete
receiving
in
exchange
mules
with
harness
and
twelve
cape
boys
to
assist
as
drivers
so
that
when
b
company
arrives
our
united
transport
establishment
will
consist
of
carts
and
two
with
two
mules
as
wheelers
and
two
ponies
as
leaders
to
each
cart
and
there
is
little
doubt
that
we
are
as
well
provided
with
transport
as
any
troops
in
the
much
better
than
most
the
remount
department
in
cape
town
were
very
good
to
us
and
replaced
not
only
our
losses
on
the
voyage
but
a
number
of
horses
which
on
landing
appeared
unfit
for
service
giving
us
in
all
chargers
the
animals
cast
in
cape
town
were
old
and
unlikely
to
get
into
condition
for
a
long
time
if
ever
they
did
so
our
calcutta
purchases
and
horses
brought
by
troopers
themselves
are
nearly
all
doing
well
in
place
of
those
we
had
lost
on
the
or
seven
gave
us
thirteen
fine
australian
cobs
which
were
told
off
as
remounts
for
the
ceylon
contingent
but
the
latter
having
been
mounted
in
the
meantime
by
the
military
authorities
and
sent
to
the
front
their
horses
were
very
properly
handed
over
to
us
in
cape
town
we
found
it
necessary
to
make
several
purchases
to
supplement
equipment
and
replace
losses
these
consisted
of
grass
nets
and
picketing
pegs
for
the
horses
and
and
canvas
for
the
men
besides
stores
amounting
in
all
to
about
worth
unfortunately
we
have
to
leave
four
men
in
hospital
sergeant
lee
stewart
whose
illness
was
mentioned
in
the
last
letter
is
much
better
but
greatly
debilitated
from
the
trying
time
he
has
had
he
has
hopes
of
joining
us
later
another
bad
case
is
that
of
boileau
from
behar
who
was
attacked
with
pneumonia
and
was
very
ill
indeed
at
one
time
however
we
have
good
reports
of
him
and
hope
to
hear
in
a
few
days
that
he
is
all
right
again
shaw
of
the
assam
contingent
and
doyle
of
the
transport
are
also
in
hospital
from
trifling
ailments
and
they
ought
soon
to
be
able
to
join
us
many
of
the
men
are
suffering
from
cuts
and
sores
on
hands
and
feet
which
do
not
seem
to
heal
up
as
fast
as
they
ought
hickley
who
was
pretty
bad
when
the
last
letter
went
is
now
all
right
again
but
daubney
has
still
to
be
careful
of
his
broken
when
we
arrived
at
cape
town
we
at
once
heard
we
were
to
proceed
to
bloemfontein
to
join
lord
roberts
as
speedily
as
possible
but
the
movement
of
large
bodies
of
troops
with
supplies
caused
a
block
on
the
railway
and
we
were
delayed
eight
days
the
wait
however
did
the
horses
good
and
they
picked
up
hand
over
fist
at
maitland
camp
all
these
details
when
looked
at
in
the
long
perspective
where
more
recent
events
show
up
sharply
and
perhaps
a
little
out
of
focus
may
seem
insignificant
as
objects
seen
through
the
wrong
end
of
a
telescope
at
the
time
of
occurrence
however
they
had
an
importance
that
impressed
itself
on
the
minds
of
men
to
whom
nearly
every
incident
of
active
service
was
then
a
novelty
and
the
duty
in
such
a
case
is
rather
to
reproduce
impressions
than
to
preserve
an
exact
proportion
moreover
some
incidents
that
may
appear
trivial
by
comparison
with
great
episodes
or
with
decisive
actions
on
which
the
fate
of
an
army
hung
were
potent
in
shaping
the
fortunes
of
horse
as
one
small
unit
of
a
mighty
whole
and
in
this
respect
if
for
no
other
reason
they
are
worthy
to
be
chronicled
it
is
the
story
of
miller
and
the
king
of
prussia
what
a
division
is
to
the
general
in
chief
of
an
army
corps
a
company
is
to
the
regimental
commander
and
for
horse
the
smallest
adventures
of
their
own
comrades
had
an
interest
which
the
civilian
reader
may
perhaps
begin
to
share
when
he
comes
to
know
more
of
them
at
cape
town
colonel
lumsden
got
the
first
news
of
b
company
since
leaving
calcutta
they
had
been
ordered
to
east
london
to
disembark
there
and
entrain
at
once
for
bethulie
in
the
orange
free
state
as
colonel
lumsden
remarked
adding
they
bade
fair
to
get
there
before
us
despite
our
start
but
our
latest
news
of
them
is
that
they
have
stopped
at
town
and
we
know
no
more
of
them
except
that
they
had
a
most
successful
a
corporal
of
the
surma
valley
light
horse
however
supplies
the
necessary
information
he
tells
how
he
went
with
an
ambulance
fatigue
party
to
which
among
others
woollright
had
been
told
off
as
an
orderly
in
charge
of
trooper
seymour
sladden
who
was
very
bad
and
had
to
be
taken
on
shore
at
east
london
before
the
company
knew
its
probable
destination
from
a
little
jetty
that
juts
out
from
the
wooded
banks
of
the
buffalo
river
they
drove
in
an
ambulance
with
the
sick
man
up
those
steep
winding
roads
past
the
luxuriant
park
with
its
odorous
groves
to
the
hill
top
there
they
carried
sladden
a
nice
clean
hospital
and
left
him
in
charge
of
kindly
nurses
where
everything
looked
very
then
somehow
they
managed
to
miss
their
officer
and
made
inquiries
for
him
in
vain
at
hotel
with
the
result
that
when
the
corporal
and
his
comrades
reached
the
they
found
to
their
joy
the
crew
gone
and
no
way
of
getting
off
to
the
ship
so
returned
to
the
hotel
and
had
dinner
afterwards
very
sleepy
and
went
straight
to
bed
and
slept
like
a
hog
first
time
in
bed
for
many
weeks
and
found
it
comfortable
other
officers
and
troopers
of
b
company
carry
on
the
narrative
in
notes
that
diverge
frequently
and
wander
off
to
alien
topics
so
that
for
the
sake
of
coherence
they
must
be
dovetailed
together
here
in
proper
order
each
chronicler
in
turn
taking
up
the
story
when
those
troopers
who
had
not
begun
to
realise
the
enormity
of
breaking
leave
returned
to
their
ship
early
in
the
morning
of
march
they
met
with
quite
an
ovation
which
does
not
seem
to
have
been
disinterested
seeing
that
they
were
supposed
to
have
brought
off
with
them
fruit
cigarettes
and
other
delicacies
much
in
request
what
they
had
would
not
have
gone
far
to
satisfy
the
cravings
of
a
whole
company
for
some
change
from
bare
rations
news
that
orders
had
come
for
horse
to
disembark
however
put
everybody
in
high
spirits
at
the
prospect
of
being
allowed
to
go
on
shore
with
freedom
to
forage
for
himself
but
they
reckoned
without
their
military
instructions
brooked
no
delay
kits
had
to
be
packed
in
a
hurry
while
the
was
being
towed
on
a
flowing
tide
across
the
troubled
bar
into
port
where
she
moored
alongside
the
railway
wharf
horses
were
then
got
on
shore
but
only
to
exchange
cramped
stalls
for
where
they
had
still
less
room
for
movement
at
this
task
the
troopers
toiled
and
sweated
all
through
the
fiercest
heat
of
a
summer
noon
learning
another
lesson
and
not
liking
it
much
unaccustomed
to
such
work
many
got
their
toes
trodden
on
by
horses
rushing
down
the
steep
gangway
or
narrowly
escaped
more
serious
injury
before
every
fretful
animal
could
be
coaxed
or
lifted
into
the
crowded
trucks
then
there
were
saddles
kits
heavy
baggage
and
ammunition
to
be
landed
and
so
without
leisure
for
a
single
meal
the
troopers
worked
on
far
into
the
night
it
was
nearly
before
the
last
section
took
its
place
in
the
train
attempted
something
done
had
earned
a
but
there
was
little
chance
of
getting
that
packed
together
as
they
were
nine
or
ten
in
a
carriage
time
must
have
softened
the
impressions
of
these
discomforts
on
the
mind
of
one
trooper
who
some
days
later
wrote
we
left
east
london
on
march
by
rail
for
bethulie
where
it
was
intended
we
should
quit
the
railway
mount
our
horses
and
trek
to
bloemfontein
east
london
turned
out
in
force
to
see
us
off
little
boys
and
girls
some
of
the
latter
not
so
very
little
after
all
were
very
keen
to
get
hold
of
our
shoulder
badges
as
mementoes
and
needless
to
say
the
susceptible
ones
of
our
corps
were
unable
to
resist
the
entreaties
of
the
fair
ones
and
daylight
showed
a
vacant
place
on
many
a
this
seems
to
be
a
great
hobby
out
here
just
now
one
boy
showed
me
a
belt
simply
covered
with
badges
which
he
had
secured
from
the
men
of
the
different
regiments
that
had
passed
through
we
travelled
in
and
carriages
ten
men
in
each
but
it
being
quite
cool
we
were
not
uncomfortable
another
correspondent
whose
experiences
were
evidently
not
so
pleasant
takes
a
less
roseate
view
he
says
hard
words
about
the
south
african
war
method
of
standing
men
some
or
so
in
a
encumbered
with
heavy
coats
rifles
and
other
leaky
roof
and
no
sides
this
may
be
economical
as
the
major
said
but
on
a
wet
blustry
night
when
buckets
of
rain
mixed
with
soot
from
the
engine
are
falling
it
is
not
a
style
of
travelling
that
conduces
to
comfort
then
there
is
still
another
african
ten
men
with
rifles
in
a
carriage
meant
to
hold
eight
only
both
of
these
methods
we
sampled
on
our
way
up
to
bloemfontein
and
right
glad
i
was
when
we
had
done
with
it
and
took
to
the
saddle
some
however
confessed
to
having
slept
very
well
that
first
night
in
such
strange
circumstances
tired
out
as
they
were
by
hours
of
previous
toil
though
they
woke
next
morning
very
cold
with
nothing
to
eat
but
one
loaf
which
ten
men
divided
between
them
they
had
eyes
for
the
picturesque
as
well
as
for
the
agricultural
possibilities
of
a
country
where
nature
does
much
and
man
apparently
very
little
except
to
stroll
about
watching
the
cattle
graze
and
the
crops
grow
unless
he
happens
to
be
a
kaffir
which
makes
all
the
difference
chiefly
however
horse
must
have
been
struck
by
the
barren
rocky
kopjes
that
seemed
to
spring
suddenly
in
the
midst
of
fertility
and
rise
range
behind
range
stretching
away
to
the
mountains
which
looked
so
near
that
it
was
impossible
for
imagination
to
measure
the
breadth
of
intervening
plains
as
one
of
them
wrote
acquaintance
with
this
country
for
the
first
time
us
realise
the
fearful
odds
that
buller
had
to
and
no
doubt
many
other
troopers
went
on
fighting
fanciful
battles
against
a
wily
enemy
who
driven
from
one
position
would
gallop
off
to
occupy
another
kopje
still
more
formidable
and
so
prolong
that
imaginary
fight
while
the
train
like
a
british
column
wound
its
slow
way
through
tortuous
defiles
horse
however
had
eyes
for
other
things
also
as
a
candid
chronicler
admits
in
his
simple
narrative
which
may
now
be
allowed
to
run
its
uninterrupted
course
at
several
stations
on
our
way
there
was
the
usual
crowd
of
ladies
of
mature
age
and
the
still
larger
crowd
of
schoolgirls
the
people
seemed
very
glad
to
see
us
there
was
a
lot
of
cheering
and
waving
of
handkerchiefs
and
pleasant
greetings
at
every
station
they
gave
us
cigarettes
and
cheroots
and
some
men
were
seen
to
be
sporting
bows
of
red
white
and
blue
when
we
attentions
from
some
fair
hands
in
return
perhaps
for
badges
of
which
many
were
by
that
time
bereft
early
next
morning
saw
us
at
cathcart
where
we
stopped
about
two
hours
and
took
the
opportunity
to
water
and
feed
our
horses
there
is
a
nice
little
inn
here
and
we
went
down
in
a
body
and
indulged
in
delicious
bread
butter
and
milk
oh
such
a
contrast
to
the
same
articles
of
diet
in
india
the
weather
at
this
time
of
the
year
is
nearly
perfect
the
air
being
fine
dry
and
invigorating
to
the
eye
wearied
by
the
flatness
of
the
plains
of
india
the
undulating
country
small
hills
and
green
valleys
between
is
very
refreshing
but
what
strikes
one
more
especially
in
the
free
state
which
we
marched
through
later
is
the
desolateness
of
the
country
miles
and
miles
of
veldt
dotted
here
and
there
with
small
houses
seems
to
be
the
principal
thing
they
go
in
for
here
but
the
farmers
say
that
what
with
rinderpest
and
drought
it
is
very
disheartening
work
the
cattle
are
very
fine
and
strike
us
especially
coming
from
india
where
one
sees
such
miserable
specimens
about
midday
we
arrived
at
town
and
were
very
much
disgusted
to
hear
that
lord
roberts
had
wired
down
that
we
were
to
detrain
and
go
into
camp
as
he
needed
all
the
and
for
carrying
remounts
several
thousands
of
which
were
collected
at
town
to
troops
at
the
front
the
camp
is
situated
about
two
miles
from
the
railway
station
but
they
have
run
a
siding
into
it
so
that
the
carriages
containing
ourselves
and
our
horses
were
simply
detached
from
the
rest
of
the
train
and
we
were
run
into
the
camp
we
did
not
take
long
in
detraining
and
picketing
our
horses
the
poor
brutes
were
simply
delighted
to
get
on
firm
ground
again
and
when
let
loose
indulged
in
all
sorts
of
on
the
grass
kicking
up
their
heels
and
larking
like
colts
to
show
appreciation
of
their
freedom
as
our
tents
had
not
arrived
yet
we
were
obliged
to
sleep
out
in
the
open
but
knowing
this
would
be
a
matter
of
course
sooner
or
later
we
made
no
bones
about
it
unfortunately
it
came
on
to
rain
at
night
and
this
made
things
generally
uncomfortable
the
mufflers
so
kindly
knitted
for
us
by
the
ladies
of
calcutta
proved
simply
invaluable
with
these
balaclava
caps
and
greatcoats
on
we
made
ourselves
perfectly
comfortable
there
were
about
twelve
men
of
the
army
service
corps
stationed
here
and
with
the
proverbial
hospitality
of
tommy
atkins
they
very
kindly
supplied
us
with
hot
cocoa
and
coffee
and
offered
to
put
up
as
many
as
possible
of
us
in
their
tents
we
found
several
of
the
queensland
mounted
volunteers
encamped
here
also
a
part
of
the
militia
battalion
of
the
cheshires
awaiting
marching
orders
like
ourselves
next
day
our
tents
arrived
and
we
were
soon
quite
settled
down
ten
men
in
a
bit
of
a
squash
but
all
right
when
one
gets
accustomed
to
it
there
they
may
be
left
for
a
time
chuckling
over
the
good
story
of
a
militia
regiment
whose
officers
complained
to
major
showers
that
they
could
not
stand
the
language
of
which
horse
made
such
free
and
frequent
use
at
and
other
daily
duties
of
course
that
language
was
only
the
mildest
of
mild
hindustani
put
into
terms
of
endearment
with
certain
genealogical
references
that
sounded
mysterious
to
the
uninitiated
footnote
hindustani
for
chapter
v
results
of
at
maitland
camp
and
town
the
two
companies
of
horse
would
probably
have
remained
many
weary
weeks
eating
their
hearts
out
with
the
fever
of
impatience
but
for
circumstances
which
must
necessarily
be
explained
at
some
length
in
order
to
give
a
clear
view
of
the
general
situation
with
events
leading
up
to
that
situation
horse
had
nothing
to
do
but
incidentally
the
crisis
had
a
great
deal
to
do
with
them
as
influencing
their
movements
immediately
afterwards
it
will
be
remembered
that
lord
roberts
had
found
it
necessary
to
halt
at
bloemfontein
a
fortnight
earlier
his
victorious
advance
beyond
that
point
being
checked
by
the
loss
of
a
very
valuable
convoy
which
had
fallen
into
the
hands
of
the
boers
at
waterval
drift
with
characteristic
cheerfulness
he
made
light
of
a
mishap
that
would
have
been
regarded
by
many
generals
as
almost
disastrous
in
the
circumstances
seeing
that
the
convoy
contained
supplies
without
which
no
forward
movement
of
troops
beyond
bloemfontein
would
be
possible
pending
the
repair
of
railways
and
the
opening
up
of
communications
with
a
secure
base
in
his
despatches
lord
roberts
makes
but
a
passing
reference
to
the
waterval
drift
affair
as
if
it
were
of
comparatively
little
importance
yet
he
knew
perfectly
well
that
its
consequences
would
be
a
temporary
paralysis
of
his
whole
force
and
delay
at
a
time
when
energetic
action
might
have
brought
the
campaign
to
a
decisive
issue
the
relief
of
ladysmith
far
from
improving
matters
in
this
respect
had
simply
set
free
a
number
of
boer
commandos
whose
leaders
baulked
in
their
ambitious
schemes
for
the
conquest
of
natal
were
burning
with
desire
to
achieve
successes
in
the
orange
free
state
from
their
point
of
view
it
was
still
possible
to
retrieve
the
disaster
of
paardeberg
and
they
knew
that
a
severe
blow
struck
at
the
british
lines
of
communication
would
bring
them
many
adherents
from
cape
colony
who
were
only
waiting
for
such
an
opportunity
it
would
also
inevitably
prolong
the
campaign
by
cutting
off
sources
of
supply
on
which
lord
roberts
was
dependent
and
it
might
even
turn
the
scale
in
their
favour
by
bringing
about
european
intervention
to
that
hope
they
clung
always
as
their
state
documents
and
correspondence
prove
abundantly
therefore
it
was
of
the
first
importance
that
they
should
assume
the
offensive
before
lord
roberts
could
strengthen
his
lines
of
communication
and
bring
up
ample
supplies
to
form
an
advanced
base
at
bloemfontein
if
circumstances
had
permitted
him
to
push
on
at
once
the
moral
effect
on
enemies
already
disorganised
and
disheartened
would
have
been
enormous
as
it
was
his
inaction
revived
the
drooping
spirits
of
boers
who
were
previously
on
the
point
of
accepting
defeat
as
inevitable
they
saw
the
inherent
weakness
of
a
force
that
could
not
move
far
in
any
direction
until
the
means
of
feeding
itself
had
been
secured
and
their
thoughts
turned
at
once
to
the
possibility
of
frustrating
that
object
by
vigorous
raids
at
every
vulnerable
point
in
such
an
emergency
the
presence
of
men
like
louis
botha
and
christian
de
wet
was
worth
more
than
a
thousand
rifles
they
had
the
brain
to
plan
and
the
intrepidity
to
attempt
any
enterprise
that
might
bring
them
an
advantage
by
embarrassing
their
adversaries
and
every
delay
on
our
side
was
an
opportunity
given
to
them
for
more
complete
concentration
this
last
word
must
not
be
misunderstood
when
applied
to
boer
strategy
or
tactics
it
does
not
necessarily
mean
a
gathering
of
units
into
one
great
force
but
rather
a
concentration
of
efforts
on
one
object
which
they
often
secure
while
seeming
to
aim
at
something
entirely
different
by
a
distribution
of
their
commandos
in
many
directions
necessarily
such
distracting
operations
can
never
bring
about
decisive
results
but
they
served
the
boer
purpose
admirably
then
and
de
wet
got
the
opportunity
he
wanted
to
prove
himself
an
ideal
leader
for
work
of
that
kind
from
some
points
of
view
this
may
be
regarded
as
the
most
important
phase
of
the
whole
campaign
it
taught
the
boers
how
to
harass
our
forces
with
the
greatest
effect
while
exposing
themselves
to
comparatively
little
danger
first
of
all
however
they
set
themselves
to
the
task
of
showing
that
there
was
life
and
power
for
mischief
in
them
yet
their
object
evidently
being
to
effect
surprises
that
might
create
panic
among
our
troops
and
so
render
raids
less
difficult
of
accomplishment
in
the
development
of
that
idea
we
recognise
the
peculiar
craft
of
christian
de
wet
who
at
that
time
had
less
respect
for
the
courage
of
than
he
began
to
entertain
soon
afterwards
post
was
a
lesson
to
him
not
less
than
to
us
with
the
exaggeration
which
characterised
a
great
deal
that
was
written
in
those
days
some
critics
at
home
described
this
affair
as
a
disaster
thereby
meaning
apparently
that
it
was
something
rather
disgraceful
and
a
stain
on
our
military
reputation
a
disaster
it
was
in
the
literal
sense
for
the
stars
in
their
courses
seemed
to
be
turned
against
us
but
they
were
certainly
not
blotted
out
and
they
never
shone
on
soldiers
whose
deeds
could
better
bear
the
light
the
story
of
post
or
koorn
spruit
is
worth
telling
again
not
only
because
it
marks
emphatically
the
revival
of
boer
hopes
after
ladysmith
and
paardeberg
and
kimberley
had
done
much
to
shatter
their
but
because
it
furnishes
a
splendid
example
of
british
valour
defiant
in
the
moment
of
defeat
and
all
the
brighter
by
contrast
with
the
gloom
through
which
it
shines
in
details
the
following
version
of
what
happened
may
not
be
more
accurate
than
others
and
it
lacks
the
completeness
that
subsequent
access
to
official
documents
might
have
given
but
at
least
it
has
the
merit
of
having
been
written
at
the
time
and
of
showing
what
was
the
impression
conveyed
to
the
minds
of
people
who
were
in
the
midst
of
those
stirring
events
and
could
gauge
their
significance
without
exaggeration
this
description
by
the
editor
who
as
war
correspondent
of
daily
news
was
then
at
bloemfontein
may
be
given
almost
in
its
original
form
we
knew
that
colonel
pilcher
in
attacking
ladybrand
had
roused
a
nest
and
that
broadwood
in
command
of
a
small
mixed
column
was
retiring
along
that
road
from
thaba
hard
pressed
by
boers
whom
he
could
only
keep
at
a
distance
by
the
skilful
disposition
of
his
forces
in
successive
rearguard
actions
his
movements
were
hampered
by
the
slow
progress
of
a
convoy
he
was
falling
back
on
a
post
at
near
the
waterworks
from
which
bloemfontein
draws
its
main
supply
and
expected
to
be
there
some
time
during
the
night
of
friday
he
had
made
application
for
reinforcements
when
the
boers
gathering
strength
as
they
came
began
to
overlap
him
on
each
flank
in
spite
of
anything
that
his
men
could
do
to
check
every
move
of
that
kind
thereupon
lord
roberts
sent
general
division
with
artillery
and
colonel
brigade
of
mounted
infantry
and
irregular
horse
eastward
by
a
forced
march
they
left
bloemfontein
hours
before
daybreak
on
friday
but
even
then
it
was
too
late
colonel
martyr
pushing
on
as
fast
as
the
condition
of
horses
would
permit
only
reached
or
kop
with
his
leading
troops
about
there
was
still
six
miles
of
veldt
between
him
and
the
scene
of
disaster
before
he
could
cross
that
in
force
sufficient
to
be
of
any
use
the
worst
had
happened
and
nothing
remained
for
him
but
to
cover
the
retreat
of
detachments
that
had
already
got
through
the
boer
lines
before
going
to
help
those
who
were
still
beset
what
were
the
causes
leading
to
disaster
we
did
not
know
do
not
know
with
absolute
certainty
even
now
no
special
correspondents
were
with
general
column
when
sudden
misfortune
fell
upon
it
all
details
had
to
be
gathered
at
second
hand
and
many
of
the
combatants
who
were
best
qualified
to
give
an
impartial
account
of
the
trap
in
which
our
troops
were
caught
were
either
dead
or
prisoners
in
the
hands
of
the
enemy
in
the
excitement
following
that
swift
surprise
those
who
had
to
fight
hard
for
their
lives
could
not
see
much
on
either
side
of
their
immediate
front
they
were
mainly
concerned
with
the
necessity
for
shooting
quick
and
straight
it
is
therefore
not
surprising
that
stories
of
the
fight
as
seen
from
many
different
points
of
view
should
vary
so
that
it
becomes
a
little
difficult
to
follow
the
exact
sequence
of
events
two
or
three
points
however
seem
tolerably
clear
when
broadwood
halted
his
troops
to
bivouac
at
on
saturday
morning
march
after
crossing
the
modder
river
they
were
worn
out
by
a
long
night
march
that
had
entailed
incessant
watchfulness
he
was
then
in
touch
with
the
small
force
of
mounted
infantry
holding
the
waterworks
and
naturally
supposing
that
their
commander
had
taken
all
precautions
to
safeguard
the
drift
across
koorn
spruit
he
did
not
call
upon
his
weary
column
to
furnish
additional
patrols
for
duty
in
that
direction
but
formed
a
chain
of
outposts
along
ridges
in
rear
towards
the
known
enemy
who
had
been
harassing
his
march
all
the
way
from
thaba
it
is
known
that
the
officer
who
was
in
command
at
post
did
take
more
than
ordinary
precautions
before
dawn
that
morning
by
sending
a
company
of
mounted
infantry
westward
across
the
drift
near
farm
and
if
a
boer
prisoner
may
be
trusted
that
very
precaution
contributed
to
the
disaster
according
to
his
story
a
party
of
three
hundred
boers
who
had
been
cut
off
from
the
main
brandfort
body
by
general
cavalry
on
thursday
were
making
their
way
across
country
to
join
or
rather
as
it
had
then
become
de
command
on
the
ladybrand
side
hearing
koorn
spruit
this
party
saw
the
mounted
infantry
patrol
and
the
first
principle
of
boers
in
warfare
being
to
hide
themselves
from
the
enemy
they
at
once
took
shelter
between
the
high
banks
of
a
which
is
in
places
nearly
as
dry
as
a
khor
in
the
soudan
then
they
began
to
plan
an
ambush
with
the
object
of
cutting
off
that
isolated
mounted
infantry
company
until
that
moment
they
had
not
thought
of
laying
a
trap
for
the
convoy
about
which
indeed
they
knew
nothing
such
is
the
story
told
by
a
boer
prisoner
if
true
it
proves
that
the
capture
of
convoy
was
by
a
force
entirely
independent
of
the
one
against
which
he
had
been
fighting
his
rearguard
actions
and
therefore
unpremeditated
or
at
any
rate
not
the
calculated
result
of
skilful
tactics
at
first
it
was
hastily
assumed
that
one
of
the
ablest
scouts
in
the
british
army
had
been
and
allowed
himself
to
be
surrounded
by
boers
that
the
officer
who
gained
distinction
for
boldness
dash
and
caution
when
reconnoitring
successive
dervish
positions
in
the
soudan
should
allow
himself
to
be
caught
in
a
trap
by
boer
farmers
was
almost
inconceivable
it
now
seems
as
if
the
enemy
had
merely
stumbled
on
an
opportunity
of
which
they
took
advantage
not
quite
realising
what
it
meant
against
this
however
was
the
evidence
of
a
civilian
refugee
who
declared
that
there
were
many
more
than
three
hundred
boers
concealed
in
koorn
spruit
and
believed
that
secret
information
must
have
been
given
to
them
of
the
fact
that
no
force
had
been
posted
to
guard
the
drift
by
which
column
must
cross
on
farm
he
met
a
burgher
who
had
given
up
his
arms
and
received
a
pass
from
our
military
authorities
permitting
him
to
return
to
his
home
and
settle
down
in
peace
secure
from
all
fear
of
molestation
at
the
hands
of
british
troops
this
disarmed
burgher
who
had
been
fighting
against
us
up
to
the
occupation
of
bloemfontein
by
lord
roberts
showed
such
an
accurate
knowledge
of
the
boer
movements
that
he
must
have
watched
them
very
closely
he
could
tell
the
exact
position
from
which
every
gun
would
open
fire
on
the
english
column
before
it
came
into
action
this
knowledge
he
imparted
without
reserve
and
yet
apparently
he
had
no
apprehensions
of
from
his
former
comrades
as
the
penalty
for
deserting
them
the
incident
whatever
interpretation
may
be
put
upon
it
is
curious
and
will
perhaps
help
to
explain
many
things
that
happened
when
submissions
were
accepted
and
passes
granted
with
too
lavish
leniency
it
is
more
than
probable
that
a
boer
attack
on
the
waterworks
in
order
to
destroy
the
pumping
machinery
there
was
part
of
a
plan
conceived
directly
after
the
occupation
of
bloemfontein
by
our
troops
but
it
could
not
be
carried
out
before
the
column
holding
thaba
had
been
forced
to
retire
the
artillery
positions
may
therefore
have
been
selected
some
time
previously
for
the
purpose
of
shelling
out
any
force
that
might
make
a
stand
at
the
waterworks
and
it
is
all
consistent
with
the
boer
statement
that
no
deliberate
attempt
was
made
by
general
pursuers
to
surround
him
until
they
found
that
his
convoy
had
been
accidentally
headed
off
and
partly
destroyed
at
the
drift
across
koorn
spruit
by
a
comparatively
small
body
lying
in
ambush
there
for
another
purpose
such
a
combination
of
accidents
seems
improbable
but
certainly
not
more
so
than
the
assumption
that
a
boer
commander
calculating
all
the
chances
to
a
nicety
had
ventured
to
detach
such
a
small
force
and
send
it
round
by
a
wide
across
some
miles
of
open
plain
with
the
object
of
intercepting
by
an
ambush
a
column
that
had
been
able
to
hold
its
own
against
odds
for
some
time
if
so
he
gave
more
hostages
to
fortune
than
the
boers
have
risked
elsewhere
whatever
may
be
the
truth
in
this
respect
it
is
clear
that
neither
the
officer
in
charge
of
communications
whose
mounted
infantry
held
post
nor
broadwood
had
reason
to
suspect
the
presence
of
any
hostile
force
in
that
immediate
neighbourhood
when
the
retiring
column
got
touch
of
its
friends
near
the
waterworks
bivouac
was
immediately
formed
and
tired
men
no
sooner
lay
down
with
saddles
for
pillows
and
rifles
by
their
sides
than
they
were
sound
asleep
leaving
the
duty
of
watchfulness
to
their
rearguard
which
in
outpost
line
occupied
a
range
of
rough
hills
southward
overlooking
the
road
by
which
they
had
retired
from
thaba
it
was
then
little
time
could
be
given
to
rest
for
the
column
had
to
start
again
in
two
hours
just
before
the
convoy
of
a
hundred
waggons
with
began
to
move
off
towards
koorn
spruit
drift
such
was
the
false
sense
of
security
that
no
armed
body
went
ahead
some
dismounted
men
whose
horses
had
been
shot
or
otherwise
used
up
marched
as
a
but
most
of
them
had
stowed
their
rifles
on
the
waggons
while
helping
to
get
the
column
in
marching
order
nothing
warned
them
that
danger
was
near
as
they
approached
the
drift
not
a
movement
was
to
be
seen
across
the
broad
veldt
but
dark
shadows
of
hills
creeping
backwards
as
the
sun
rose
at
that
moment
from
a
distant
hill
in
rear
overtopping
the
outpost
ridge
darted
the
flash
of
a
boer
gun
then
another
and
another
from
different
positions
followed
by
the
shriek
of
shells
and
the
crash
of
bursting
charges
every
shot
well
aimed
struck
with
a
dull
thud
and
threw
up
columns
of
earth
among
or
near
the
masses
of
men
who
were
saddling
up
or
inspanning
teams
for
the
march
but
did
no
damage
beyond
frightening
mules
and
increasing
the
confusion
where
cape
boys
in
their
haste
to
obey
a
peremptory
order
got
harness
entangled
and
themselves
bewildered
our
horse
artillery
being
in
a
hollow
and
masked
by
the
movement
of
troops
about
them
did
not
reply
but
limbered
up
and
followed
the
transport
waggons
which
by
that
time
had
begun
to
cross
the
drift
nearly
half
of
them
had
cleared
it
when
from
behind
steep
banks
in
the
winding
spruit
on
each
side
boers
galloped
forward
in
dense
troops
and
halting
with
rifles
at
the
present
summoned
everybody
to
surrender
some
men
of
the
baggage
guard
got
to
their
arms
and
lying
between
waggon
wheels
opened
fire
but
they
were
few
and
the
boers
many
the
others
unarmed
could
do
nothing
but
obey
the
stern
mandate
up
your
hands
come
this
way
and
give
us
your
then
u
battery
of
the
royal
horse
artillery
following
close
upon
the
waggons
was
surrounded
before
a
gun
could
be
wheeled
about
for
front
and
the
drivers
were
ordered
to
dismount
and
outspan
gunners
however
do
not
yield
without
a
struggle
even
when
their
eyes
look
into
the
barrel
of
an
levelled
rifle
hands
were
on
revolvers
in
an
instant
but
before
these
could
be
drawn
shooting
had
begun
and
many
a
gallant
fellow
fell
horses
too
were
shot
down
or
being
wounded
plunged
madly
over
the
traces
one
team
startled
by
the
din
about
it
stampeded
and
galloped
off
with
gun
and
limber
but
no
drivers
thus
one
gun
was
saved
the
other
five
fell
into
boer
hands
their
gunners
being
either
killed
wounded
or
taken
prisoners
martin
escaped
and
ran
back
to
warn
major
hornby
who
in
command
of
q
battery
was
then
scarcely
a
hundred
yards
from
the
scene
of
disaster
that
officer
gave
the
order
to
unlimber
and
come
into
action
but
could
not
open
fire
while
our
men
and
the
enemy
were
mixed
up
together
among
and
at
the
same
time
his
own
gunners
were
being
shot
down
a
small
body
of
scouts
made
one
plucky
effort
to
get
near
the
captured
battery
but
suffered
heavily
then
two
troops
of
horse
acting
as
escort
for
the
convoy
dashed
forward
to
cross
the
spruit
and
take
the
boers
in
flank
but
they
were
confronted
by
enemies
from
another
ambush
who
at
a
distance
of
only
a
few
yards
had
them
covered
and
called
upon
them
to
surrender
their
only
answer
was
but
it
came
too
late
and
before
they
could
get
out
of
range
nearly
every
saddle
was
emptied
only
five
men
got
away
and
of
these
four
were
wounded
among
the
missing
nine
officers
had
either
been
killed
or
fallen
into
the
hands
emboldened
by
success
the
boers
came
into
the
open
as
they
had
never
done
before
they
galloped
up
to
groups
of
men
who
were
fighting
shoulder
to
shoulder
reined
in
and
shot
as
they
sat
in
the
saddle
reckless
of
the
bullets
that
whistled
about
them
one
body
charged
close
up
to
a
maxim
gun
that
was
pouring
out
a
deadly
torrent
of
bullets
and
silenced
it
for
a
time
by
shooting
down
the
detachment
but
whether
they
got
away
or
fell
victims
to
their
own
bravery
could
not
be
seen
as
the
struggle
surged
round
them
three
new
zealanders
whom
i
met
coming
out
of
the
fight
told
the
story
and
spoke
with
admiration
of
the
daring
displayed
by
many
of
their
foes
but
still
more
enthusiastically
of
the
splendid
courage
of
our
horse
artillery
of
these
three
one
was
a
fine
type
of
the
maori
the
others
hardy
colonists
who
looked
as
if
they
had
faced
death
more
than
and
calm
they
had
evidently
taken
mental
note
of
all
that
passed
within
sight
of
them
while
they
with
others
held
a
group
of
buildings
keeping
the
enemy
in
check
by
steady
shooting
major
hornby
finding
that
he
could
not
bring
his
guns
to
bear
at
short
range
without
shooting
down
friend
as
well
as
foe
limbered
up
to
get
clear
of
the
close
in
wheeling
round
on
rough
ground
one
gun
capsized
bringing
all
the
team
down
with
and
drivers
together
in
a
confused
mass
the
boers
saw
their
chance
and
brought
a
withering
rifle
fire
to
bear
so
that
every
attempt
to
right
the
gun
failed
under
this
fire
the
two
wheelers
of
another
team
fell
the
leaders
struggled
on
for
a
time
dragging
their
maimed
comrades
then
came
to
a
standstill
and
that
gun
also
had
to
be
left
behind
marksmen
of
the
durham
light
infantry
did
their
best
to
keep
down
the
fire
while
volunteers
ran
out
to
help
the
distressed
gunners
who
managing
to
escape
went
off
for
fresh
horses
captain
gore
anley
commanding
the
essex
mounted
infantry
aided
by
two
of
his
men
brought
a
wounded
gunner
from
under
that
terrific
fire
to
safety
and
then
went
out
with
a
to
help
at
the
guns
time
after
time
the
artillerymen
brought
up
fresh
teams
which
were
shot
down
before
they
could
be
hooked
to
the
limbers
one
driver
had
nine
horses
killed
or
wounded
before
he
gave
up
the
attempt
as
hopeless
meanwhile
major
hornby
with
four
guns
of
his
own
command
and
the
only
one
remaining
of
u
battery
which
had
been
recaptured
after
stampeding
moved
southward
to
a
position
twelve
hundred
yards
from
koorn
spruit
drift
there
he
brought
them
into
action
with
a
cool
audacity
and
effect
that
paralysed
the
enemy
though
he
could
not
save
the
guns
that
had
been
left
behind
he
could
cover
the
retirement
of
cavalry
and
mounted
infantry
of
the
rearguard
who
unable
longer
to
hold
the
low
ridge
against
heavy
odds
were
being
forced
back
from
the
waterworks
fighting
stubbornly
though
threatened
in
flank
by
the
force
that
had
captured
our
convoy
shelled
at
from
right
and
left
smitten
by
storms
of
rifle
bullets
the
gunners
of
q
battery
never
budged
coolly
as
if
at
target
practice
they
loaded
and
aimed
the
shells
burst
among
the
boers
checking
more
than
one
attempt
at
a
rush
and
then
the
remnants
of
a
shattered
brigade
were
enabled
to
retire
upon
their
supports
who
had
rallied
for
a
stand
at
the
station
buildings
all
the
time
officers
and
men
of
the
army
medical
corps
were
covering
themselves
with
honour
by
brilliant
services
rendered
to
stricken
soldiers
who
lay
helpless
where
the
ground
was
torn
by
bullets
the
coolest
deed
of
all
however
was
done
by
an
american
named
todd
a
trooper
in
horse
with
a
comrade
he
had
first
volunteered
to
go
out
and
bring
in
some
stray
horses
for
the
disabled
guns
before
they
had
ridden
fifty
yards
the
second
trooper
was
shot
dead
but
todd
galloped
on
straight
towards
the
boers
rounded
up
both
horses
and
had
nearly
brought
them
back
when
one
was
killed
when
he
rejoined
his
detachment
todd
heard
an
officer
asking
for
volunteers
to
go
out
in
search
of
their
doctor
who
was
lying
wounded
in
a
donga
without
waiting
to
hear
more
the
trooper
turned
his
head
towards
the
boer
lines
again
and
galloped
off
twenty
minutes
later
he
rode
back
slowly
bearing
a
heavy
burden
on
his
arms
see
the
doctor
anywhere
he
said
i
have
brought
back
the
only
wounded
man
that
i
found
alive
if
ever
a
man
earned
the
right
to
wear
the
grim
badge
of
horse
it
is
trooper
todd
deeds
of
heroism
however
were
not
rare
that
day
they
could
not
avert
disaster
but
they
shed
a
light
upon
it
that
dispels
the
shadow
of
humiliation
our
men
had
still
hard
fighting
to
do
before
they
could
hope
to
extricate
themselves
retirement
upon
the
station
buildings
was
not
effected
without
difficulty
and
it
is
wonderful
that
he
should
have
been
able
to
keep
the
remnants
of
so
many
broken
squadrons
in
hand
while
they
were
weakened
by
further
losses
every
minute
and
the
enemy
gathered
strength
several
horsemen
escaping
got
away
across
the
veldt
and
then
forming
groups
headed
towards
kop
boers
pursuing
for
some
distance
but
the
main
body
made
a
stand
at
the
station
buildings
and
fought
it
out
for
two
weary
hours
so
fiercely
that
the
enemy
did
not
dare
to
come
to
closer
quarters
the
company
of
burmese
mounted
infantry
that
had
been
on
outpost
duty
west
of
koorn
spruit
when
they
found
themselves
cut
off
by
boers
in
ambush
made
an
attempt
to
rejoin
the
main
body
but
were
in
turn
surrounded
having
some
advantage
of
ground
though
outnumbered
they
were
enabled
to
hold
their
assailants
off
until
then
the
scene
changed
troops
appeared
on
kop
they
were
the
advanced
guard
of
colonel
mounted
infantry
brigade
which
had
made
a
forced
march
to
relieve
the
beleaguered
column
their
commander
halted
only
long
enough
to
let
the
main
body
close
up
and
then
to
the
came
sweeping
across
the
veldt
as
fast
as
their
jaded
horses
could
move
but
the
boers
were
at
their
old
tactics
again
and
the
queensland
mounted
infantry
fell
into
a
trap
skilfully
laid
for
them
before
the
enemy
could
reap
much
advantage
however
colonel
henry
was
at
them
with
all
his
companies
of
regular
mounted
infantry
which
the
astute
brigadier
had
ordered
forward
when
he
saw
the
queensland
men
in
difficulties
the
young
officer
who
has
spent
many
years
with
egyptian
camel
corps
chasing
dervish
raiders
and
scouting
about
their
strongholds
was
not
to
be
caught
by
a
boer
ambush
he
advanced
upon
them
in
a
formation
too
flexible
even
for
their
mobility
and
gradually
drove
them
before
him
until
the
burmese
and
queensland
mounted
infantry
were
enabled
to
fight
their
way
through
the
weakened
cordon
this
timely
diversion
gave
general
broadwood
his
opportunity
major
battery
fell
back
to
another
position
covering
the
retirement
and
then
the
column
leaving
its
wounded
under
care
of
our
own
surgeons
retired
slowly
to
join
the
welcome
reinforcements
they
had
to
turn
again
and
again
to
face
the
foe
who
still
hung
on
their
heels
and
all
the
way
they
were
shelled
by
boer
guns
until
a
final
stand
was
made
near
the
waterworks
where
the
enemy
dared
not
attack
though
the
artillery
fire
continued
for
nearly
two
hours
longer
late
that
afternoon
the
highland
brigade
under
general
hector
macdonald
passed
kop
and
advanced
to
get
touch
of
the
enemy
near
modder
river
but
except
for
a
few
shells
and
sputtering
rifle
fire
no
attempt
was
made
by
the
boers
to
resist
this
advance
when
general
brigade
and
other
troops
of
the
ninth
division
joined
macdonald
the
column
that
had
fought
so
well
after
disaster
fell
upon
it
dispersed
into
scattered
remnants
once
more
each
unit
making
for
the
appointed
bivouac
in
any
want
of
formation
best
adapted
to
the
needs
of
weary
men
who
had
to
walk
because
their
horses
were
more
tired
than
themselves
what
a
it
would
have
been
if
the
brigadier
had
not
in
mercy
spared
them
that
melancholy
ordeal
when
the
losses
came
to
be
counted
they
numbered
in
dead
wounded
and
prisoners
nearly
a
third
of
the
force
that
had
marched
out
of
thaba
forty
hours
earlier
of
u
battery
royal
horse
artillery
only
a
mere
handful
remained
and
q
battery
had
suffered
heavily
too
seven
out
of
twelve
guns
had
been
left
in
the
hands
with
some
eighty
baggage
waggons
full
of
stores
household
cavalry
hussars
and
mounted
infantry
had
losses
to
mourn
and
horse
the
most
of
all
unhappily
it
was
too
late
to
hope
that
either
guns
or
convoy
could
be
recaptured
they
had
all
been
taken
off
during
the
afternoon
towards
thaba
and
boers
were
in
possession
of
the
waterworks
with
artillery
on
heights
behind
covering
the
road
next
day
a
demonstration
of
the
whole
force
under
general
command
was
made
as
if
to
drive
every
boer
from
the
waterworks
where
mischief
had
been
done
by
the
destruction
of
pumping
engines
but
it
ended
in
nothing
and
then
we
gradually
drew
in
our
forces
the
boers
assumed
the
offensive
again
and
began
to
threaten
our
line
of
communications
at
several
points
these
were
the
conditions
that
made
lord
roberts
anxious
to
secure
the
services
of
every
mounted
corps
on
which
he
could
rely
for
meeting
the
new
boer
tactics
by
swift
most
of
them
he
had
foreseen
when
orders
were
sent
for
horse
to
be
supplied
with
all
the
remounts
necessary
for
repairing
losses
and
pushed
on
to
the
front
post
with
all
its
consequences
had
not
been
counted
on
but
it
made
the
need
for
mounted
troops
all
the
more
urgent
in
order
that
pressure
round
about
wepener
might
be
relieved
and
lines
of
communication
cleared
that
action
lamentable
because
of
the
sacrifices
it
entailed
but
glorious
in
its
heroic
incidents
gave
to
horse
not
only
an
opportunity
but
an
example
and
we
may
be
sure
that
when
the
news
reached
them
at
maitland
camp
and
at
town
every
trooper
made
up
his
mind
to
be
a
worthy
comrade
of
the
men
who
had
risked
their
lives
so
nobly
and
fought
with
such
stubborn
valour
in
vain
attempts
to
save
the
guns
at
post
illustration
chapter
vi
rail
and
route
march
to
a
week
was
more
than
enough
in
which
to
exhaust
all
the
charms
that
a
company
could
find
round
about
its
dusty
camp
at
maitland
the
fragrance
from
woodland
belts
of
pine
and
eucalyptus
trees
soon
began
to
pall
there
was
little
to
refresh
the
eye
in
that
changeless
view
across
unbroken
flats
where
a
grey
haze
hung
morning
noon
and
eve
veiling
the
distant
mountains
northward
the
beauty
of
table
mountain
as
seen
from
there
with
steeps
towering
up
to
the
clouds
is
not
a
joy
for
ever
and
cape
town
shows
its
least
attractive
side
towards
maitland
which
in
itself
is
the
embodiment
of
suburban
dreariness
having
but
two
places
of
swimming
bath
and
an
observatory
as
admission
to
the
latter
can
only
be
gained
by
a
special
permit
from
the
astronomer
royal
horse
had
few
opportunities
to
appreciate
the
wild
dissipation
of
ascending
its
quaint
old
tower
which
indeed
most
of
them
mistook
for
a
dismantled
windmill
and
the
amusements
that
cape
town
offers
to
soldiers
of
less
than
commissioned
rank
had
few
temptations
for
troopers
of
horse
mount
nelson
with
its
gay
crowd
of
fair
women
and
maimed
heroes
was
to
them
but
a
vision
of
the
life
that
had
been
how
those
dainty
damsels
would
have
been
shocked
to
see
a
trooper
in
khaki
and
ammunition
boots
treading
the
glades
and
terraced
heights
of
that
south
african
olympus
but
not
more
shocked
than
a
man
of
horse
would
have
felt
at
finding
himself
in
such
a
situation
ridiculous
prejudice
of
course
and
to
be
condemned
by
all
people
in
whose
opinion
the
uniform
is
a
badge
of
honour
yes
but
like
many
other
badges
it
has
to
be
worn
with
a
difference
and
nobody
knows
better
than
those
who
have
tried
the
experiment
of
putting
it
on
that
a
private
service
kit
is
not
the
garb
in
which
one
would
choose
to
appear
where
fashion
and
beauty
congregate
a
man
may
have
served
through
a
whole
campaign
in
the
lowest
ranks
obedient
to
every
command
however
humiliating
or
distasteful
and
not
have
felt
the
yoke
gall
him
half
so
sorely
as
it
does
when
he
first
realises
the
social
inferiority
that
it
implies
let
us
have
done
with
cant
and
confess
at
once
that
a
man
who
puts
on
the
common
uniform
for
active
service
whether
he
be
volunteer
or
regular
thereby
renounces
all
claims
to
the
rights
and
privileges
of
a
gentleman
the
gay
haunts
of
a
city
are
not
for
him
then
if
he
cherishes
his
and
the
troopers
of
horse
had
that
truth
impressed
upon
them
long
before
their
week
of
rest
at
cape
town
came
to
an
end
they
were
no
more
squeamish
than
others
and
their
experiences
in
this
direction
have
been
shared
by
every
yeomanry
corps
and
volunteer
detachment
after
the
first
burst
of
enthusiasm
on
their
account
exhausted
itself
cheerful
endurance
of
these
things
may
be
counted
not
least
among
the
merits
of
men
who
gave
up
much
to
serve
their
country
in
her
hour
of
need
and
to
ignore
them
would
be
to
misunderstand
the
nature
of
many
sacrifices
made
by
the
of
a
regiment
like
horse
in
times
more
propitious
they
would
have
appreciated
fully
all
the
charms
that
cape
town
can
offer
but
as
it
was
the
parting
had
no
great
pang
for
them
and
a
company
hailed
with
unalloyed
delight
the
order
for
an
advance
northward
into
the
land
of
infinite
possibilities
there
was
to
be
no
route
marching
for
that
detachment
the
cape
colony
lines
being
comparatively
clear
of
troop
traffic
so
that
the
prospect
of
reaching
bloemfontein
by
rail
without
serious
interruption
seemed
almost
a
certainty
it
was
on
friday
march
that
colonel
lumsden
received
direct
from
headquarters
the
welcome
intimation
that
he
and
his
two
companies
were
wanted
at
the
front
colonel
lumsden
naturally
felt
himself
very
fortunate
in
receiving
orders
by
which
his
corps
was
chosen
for
active
service
while
regular
regiments
and
yeomanry
companies
waited
impatiently
at
the
base
in
cape
town
but
lord
roberts
needed
mounted
troops
more
than
infantry
just
then
everybody
accepted
this
as
the
first
real
step
of
the
great
march
on
which
their
hearts
were
set
and
its
crowning
triumph
at
pretoria
they
were
not
to
be
out
of
it
after
all
and
we
may
be
sure
that
they
wanted
no
second
call
when
the
warning
came
for
them
to
get
their
kits
packed
and
be
ready
for
a
start
by
train
the
next
morning
this
was
glad
news
for
all
except
four
unfortunate
troopers
who
much
to
their
sorrow
had
to
be
left
in
hospital
at
cape
town
these
were
james
of
whose
case
colonel
lumsden
wrote
a
week
or
so
earlier
knyvitt
boileau
of
tyrhoot
hubert
noel
shaw
of
palumpur
and
john
canute
doyle
of
the
transport
detachment
of
others
who
were
invalids
on
the
voyage
howard
hickley
had
quite
recovered
and
pleading
hard
that
he
was
quite
fit
to
ride
and
shoot
in
spite
of
a
broken
got
permission
to
rejoin
his
section
for
duty
so
keen
were
the
men
to
be
near
the
fighting
line
that
they
have
hardly
recorded
their
impressions
of
the
strange
country
through
which
they
passed
and
but
for
an
incidental
note
here
and
there
like
the
opening
paragraph
of
the
following
letter
we
might
almost
imagine
that
profound
peace
reigned
throughout
the
country
yet
the
letter
was
dated
only
three
days
after
our
troops
had
suffered
so
heavily
at
post
writing
on
the
morning
of
april
a
trooper
whose
letters
were
sent
to
the
said
it
is
wonderful
to
think
that
this
very
afternoon
we
shall
be
in
bloemfontein
and
may
see
the
great
old
man
whose
masterly
tactics
have
so
completely
turned
the
tide
of
war
on
friday
we
heard
the
line
was
clear
and
this
news
was
quickly
followed
by
a
warning
to
hold
ourselves
in
readiness
immediately
on
top
came
the
order
to
be
at
the
railway
station
the
following
day
by
a
mighty
packing
up
of
kit
and
piling
up
of
supplies
resulted
in
a
successful
transference
of
our
goods
and
chattels
to
the
station
by
the
appointed
time
and
at
we
steamed
out
of
cape
town
in
two
trains
one
following
the
other
when
we
left
camp
ammunition
was
served
out
fifty
rounds
a
man
and
the
weight
of
it
has
not
added
to
our
comfort
the
railway
journey
has
proved
very
pleasant
so
far
however
some
slight
description
of
how
we
are
packed
aboard
may
be
interesting
we
heard
with
no
little
misgiving
that
we
were
to
be
eight
in
a
compartment
for
we
expected
nothing
but
the
ordinary
wooden
carriage
and
no
chance
of
lying
down
at
all
during
the
three
days
to
be
occupied
in
journeying
to
the
free
state
capital
so
it
was
a
pleasant
surprise
to
find
corridor
carriages
comfortably
upholstered
in
leather
with
sleeping
accommodation
in
each
compartment
for
four
men
at
a
time
there
were
one
or
two
carriages
equally
comfortable
with
the
additional
advantage
of
an
extra
tier
of
berths
accommodating
six
sleepers
one
on
the
floor
and
one
in
the
passage
and
the
whole
boiling
of
us
slept
the
sleep
of
the
just
the
whole
night
through
rations
consisted
of
tinned
corned
beef
and
biscuits
suspiciously
like
dog
biscuits
but
good
to
eat
people
with
teeth
and
stomachs
of
brass
but
nearly
everywhere
we
stopped
there
were
where
you
paid
sixpence
for
everything
and
an
ordinary
chota
hazri
sort
of
meal
ran
up
to
about
as
we
travel
up
country
we
find
everything
very
dear
and
we
wonder
government
does
not
make
some
effort
to
arrange
that
the
troops
should
be
supplied
with
tinned
goods
at
reasonable
prices
if
private
contractors
can
get
stuff
up
certainly
government
which
has
first
call
on
the
railways
can
too
the
devils
packed
ten
eleven
and
twelve
in
a
and
the
way
they
kick
at
times
is
a
caution
all
along
the
train
the
trucks
are
broken
and
splintered
oh
for
the
luxury
of
our
indian
horseboxes
however
three
times
a
day
we
manage
to
feed
and
water
the
poor
brutes
and
though
their
meals
are
somewhat
scratch
they
do
so
badly
forage
is
of
the
compressed
hay
and
english
oats
and
bran
de
aar
was
the
first
place
of
real
interest
we
came
to
and
there
we
beheld
a
battered
armoured
train
covered
with
bullet
marks
then
we
touched
at
naauwpoort
which
was
crowded
with
soldiers
the
train
stopped
just
opposite
rensburg
so
we
got
out
and
had
a
game
of
football
with
an
empty
tin
for
ball
and
broken
saddles
for
right
on
the
place
where
the
battle
of
rensburg
had
been
fought
a
few
months
previously
from
there
we
could
see
the
broken
cone
of
kop
rising
from
a
plain
like
a
huge
with
sheer
escarpments
up
which
the
naval
brigade
hauled
two
by
means
of
a
wire
rope
and
struck
terror
into
the
boers
at
colesberg
when
those
guns
opened
fire
from
that
apparently
inaccessible
height
afterwards
came
pont
where
we
prepared
to
cross
the
orange
river
unluckily
we
crossed
at
in
the
morning
when
very
little
could
be
seen
it
is
wonderful
how
the
sappers
have
repaired
the
bridge
we
spun
across
in
pontoons
with
the
water
swirling
within
two
feet
of
us
shortly
after
crossing
the
river
we
were
halted
and
ordered
to
draw
another
fifty
rounds
of
ammunition
per
man
and
to
post
two
sentries
to
each
carriage
every
man
to
wear
his
bandolier
have
his
rifle
handy
and
be
ready
to
turn
out
at
a
notice
firing
had
been
heard
that
evening
and
there
was
no
doubt
boers
were
in
the
vicinity
later
some
thirty
miles
south
of
bloemfontein
we
heard
that
the
troops
stationed
to
protect
the
railway
line
had
been
out
in
the
surrounding
kopjes
during
the
night
and
that
a
boer
commando
strong
had
been
seen
travelling
south
so
we
are
bang
in
the
thick
of
it
now
and
ere
many
more
hours
have
passed
we
shall
be
within
sound
of
the
firing
for
we
hear
fighting
is
going
on
steadily
to
the
north
of
bloemfontein
the
men
are
in
splendid
spirits
and
health
and
wild
to
get
a
turn
at
the
enemy
altogether
we
have
every
reason
to
congratulate
ourselves
on
the
comfortable
and
speedy
journey
we
have
made
to
the
front
the
man
who
could
regard
de
arid
de
the
first
place
of
interest
on
that
long
railway
journey
simply
because
an
armoured
train
with
bullet
was
standing
in
the
station
must
have
been
in
a
very
warlike
frame
of
mind
indeed
but
perhaps
the
comfortable
railway
travelling
so
conducive
to
the
of
the
just
may
account
for
much
probably
the
slumberous
heat
of
afternoon
had
caused
him
to
doze
before
the
train
slowed
down
at
stellenbosch
which
was
a
place
of
much
notoriety
at
the
time
and
picturesque
too
with
its
great
oak
avenues
dating
from
a
day
when
commandant
van
der
stel
the
planter
of
them
was
there
with
his
young
wife
in
the
very
foreposts
of
dutch
civilisation
not
much
more
than
thirty
miles
from
cape
town
and
more
picturesque
still
because
of
its
quaint
thatched
houses
as
old
as
the
oaks
stellenbosch
is
a
great
centre
of
education
and
according
to
the
it
has
a
home
for
the
training
of
a
limited
number
of
poor
whites
we
know
the
for
whose
training
a
home
was
provided
at
stellenbosch
about
the
time
when
a
company
of
horse
passed
that
way
and
afterwards
they
were
mostly
officers
of
high
rank
who
had
not
distinguished
themselves
and
for
whom
a
refuge
had
to
be
found
where
they
could
do
no
greater
mischief
than
send
useless
remounts
from
that
depôt
to
the
front
so
stellenbosch
grew
in
repute
and
visits
to
it
without
return
tickets
were
so
frequent
that
an
expressive
verb
had
to
be
coined
for
use
in
everyday
conversation
the
phrase
be
stellenbosched
if
i
do
became
quite
familiar
and
many
a
gallant
officer
knew
to
his
cost
what
it
meant
rustication
in
that
old
dutch
settlement
under
leafy
arcades
where
in
ordinary
times
stillness
of
the
cloisters
reigns
was
not
the
only
penalty
these
however
were
things
not
known
to
recent
arrivals
like
horse
who
might
have
met
and
hobnobbed
with
the
latest
candidate
for
stellenbosch
and
have
been
none
the
wiser
so
they
went
on
their
way
thinking
nothing
of
the
old
dutch
town
and
its
new
notoriety
and
in
the
darkness
of
night
when
the
new
moon
showed
no
more
than
a
crescent
thread
of
silver
were
winding
by
sharp
curves
and
steep
gradients
up
the
kloofs
of
hex
river
mountains
towards
the
great
karroo
troopers
saw
little
of
the
glorious
landscape
that
is
opened
up
at
that
height
those
who
were
not
asleep
had
no
light
to
see
it
by
but
the
cold
light
of
the
stars
and
that
seemed
to
be
swallowed
up
in
the
depths
of
impenetrable
shadow
except
where
the
lamps
of
worcester
town
in
the
plains
feet
below
twinkled
like
feeble
reflections
on
a
sea
then
the
swift
dawn
came
and
when
the
sun
rose
they
were
crossing
the
great
karroo
which
at
that
time
of
true
winter
of
cape
its
least
attractive
garb
bare
patches
of
sandy
soil
gaped
between
scattered
clumps
of
scrub
where
a
month
or
so
later
it
would
be
glowing
with
the
purple
and
gold
and
scarlet
flowers
of
lilies
and
asters
innumerable
and
the
gorgeous
crowns
of
mesembryanthemums
of
every
conceivable
shade
from
white
through
primrose
and
orange
to
the
deepest
crimson
in
its
winter
state
the
great
karroo
brings
back
to
travellers
of
wide
african
experience
clear
memories
of
the
northern
soudan
in
all
chief
physical
features
the
two
regions
so
widely
separated
are
curiously
alike
here
are
pyramidal
mountains
with
crowns
rising
above
the
conical
base
exactly
resembling
the
on
which
one
has
looked
with
weary
eyes
day
after
day
through
the
rippling
heat
of
the
soudan
deserts
in
some
parts
of
the
karroo
these
mountains
close
upon
narrow
gorges
along
which
the
railway
winds
and
its
sudden
turns
round
rocky
buttresses
seem
so
familiar
to
one
who
knows
the
old
military
line
above
wady
halfa
that
he
can
imagine
himself
travelling
once
more
through
the
desolate
batn
el
hagar
towards
khartoum
to
men
for
whom
the
rugged
karroo
had
no
such
associations
with
the
land
of
mysterious
fascination
there
may
well
have
been
a
wearisome
monotony
in
the
unvarying
repetition
of
similar
vast
plains
whereon
no
tree
bigger
than
the
grows
and
where
the
houses
if
any
are
so
widely
separated
that
they
only
serve
to
deepen
the
impression
of
melancholy
solitude
the
waterless
rivers
the
bare
brown
kops
for
full
appreciation
of
the
karroo
one
must
have
breathed
its
invigorating
air
from
childhood
and
seen
it
in
seasons
of
beauty
with
all
the
glory
of
its
summer
raiment
on
de
aar
junction
is
no
more
than
a
huge
collection
of
railway
sheds
and
equally
hideous
houses
set
in
the
most
barren
plain
of
the
great
karroo
but
horse
saw
it
busy
with
many
signs
of
military
preparation
for
a
forward
movement
and
so
it
seemed
to
them
the
very
gateway
of
the
fateful
future
in
the
shaping
of
which
they
were
to
have
a
hand
that
night
they
crossed
the
orange
river
at
pont
where
railway
pioneers
mostly
skilled
artificers
from
the
johannesburg
mines
under
major
greatest
of
mechanical
engineers
as
colonel

styled

and

while

was
being
transferred
by

crossed
the

side
and
when
morning
dawned
they
were
journeying
many
precautions
against
possible
surprises
by
marauding
the
goal
of
their
hopes
bloemfontein
was
reached
by
a
company
in
the
afternoon
of
april
when
they
went
into
camp
at
rustfontein
two
miles
from
the
town
and
became
part
of
the
regiment
under
the
command
of
that
very
able
leader
colonel
ross
whose
portrait
appears
on
the
opposite
page
of
him
colonel
lumsden
writes
better
man
could
have
been
chosen
to
command
a
body
of
irregular
horse
capable
tactful
with
a
keen
eye
for
a
country
and
a
man
hard
to
beat
in
the
saddle
he
was
in
fact
an
ideal
leader
at
the
game
he
had
to
play
we
were
under
his
command
from
the
time
the
was
formed
at
bloemfontein
early
in
april
taking
part
in
every
action
of
that
eventful
march
to
pretoria
and
the
had
the
honour
of
scouting
in
front
of
headquarters
after
the
memorable
june
when
the
capital
of
the
south
african
republic
fell
into
our
hands
horse
were
placed
for
some
time
on
communications
at
irene
and
kalfontein
but
their
colonel
tiring
of
this
inaction
applied
to
general
for
more
congenial
employment
his
wish
was
shortly
afterwards
gratified
and
horse
with
mutual
regrets
on
both
sides
were
transferred
to
another
column
thus
severing
their
connection
with
the
and
the
leader
whose
soldierly
qualities
had
endeared
him
to
all
ranks
their
respect
for
him
found
appropriate
expression
long
afterwards
when
every
man
of
the
corps
from
colonel
lumsden
downwards
subscribed
for
a
badge
the
regimental
in
diamonds
and
this
they
presented
to
ross
in
token
of
their
admiration
for
her
husband
as
a
commander
and
in
appreciation
of
the
considerate
kindness
he
had
shown
to
all
ranks
while
they
served
under
him
that
the
admiration
was
not
all
on
one
side
may
be
gathered
from
an
incident
that
occurred
some
time
after
horse
were
embodied
with
the
mounted
infantry
corps
and
colonel
lumsden
thinks
justly
that
no
better
proof
could
be
given
of
the
able
and
smart
class
of
men
he
had
in
his
command
than
the
following
remark
from
colonel
ross
whenever
i
ask
you
to
send
me
an
or
galloper
never
mind
sending
me
one
of
your
officers
your
troopers
are
just
the
class
i
illustration
major
local
colonel
ross
some
months
after
the
severance
of
associations
that
had
been
so
pleasant
for
commander
and
commanded
when
horse
had
seen
their
last
of
south
african
fighting
colonel
ross
had
the
lower
part
of
his
face
shattered
by
a
bullet
while
attacking
a
boer
position
at
bothaville
with
the
gallant
dash
which
his
old
comrades
remember
so
well
in
that
fight
de
forces
were
completely
routed
and
lost
nearly
all
their
artillery
but
the
victory
was
not
achieved
without
heavy
sacrifices
on
our
side
colonel
le
gallais
who
commanded
the
mounted
infantry
and
also
captain
williams
formerly
of
the
corps
under
colonel
ross
were
killed
while
going
to
the
assistance
of
their
and
in
the
same
fight
lieutenant
percy
smith
who
had
gained
honours
as
a
trooper
of
horse
at
ospruit
when
he
went
out
with
his
colonel
to
bring
in
a
helpless
comrade
was
wounded
in
the
performance
of
a
gallant
action
by
which
he
won
the
for
the
sake
of
finishing
a
story
events
have
been
somewhat
anticipated
and
b
company
may
resent
the
interpolation
at
this
stage
of
a
flattering
comment
that
belongs
properly
to
a
later
period
in
the
actions
from
which
colonel
ross
formed
his
high
opinion
of
troopers
b
company
had
taken
its
full
share
before
resuming
touch
with
the
movements
of
that
body
however
reference
must
be
made
to
another
incident
in
which
a
company
had
the
proud
distinction
of
representing
the
whole
corps
the
occasion
was
a
visit
on
april
by
lord
roberts
who
after
inspecting
the
company
called
out
and
shook
hands
with
trooper
hugh
blair
whose
brother
an
officer
of
the
royal
engineers
had
been
badly
wounded
in
the
candahar
campaign
the
then
made
a
brief
speech
to
colonel
lumsden
and
his
troopers
of
this
no
shorthand
note
or
transcription
from
mental
tablets
seems
to
have
been
made
but
its
meaning
is
probably
expressed
in
the
following
letter
which
lord
roberts
wrote
to
sir
playfair
chairman
of
the
executive
committee
of
horse
sir
patrick
thanks
for
your
letter
of
february
a
few
evenings
ago
i
had
great
pleasure
in
inspecting
horse
immediately
after
their
arrival
here
i
sent
a
telegram
to
the
viceroy
to
inform
him
that
i
had
done
so
they
are
a
workmanlike
useful
lot
i
am
sure
they
will
do
splendidly
in
whatever
position
they
may
be
placed
it
is
most
gratifying
to
hear
the
way
in
which
the
corps
was
raised
the
sum
subscribed
by
the
public
generally
is
the
proof
of
the
patriotism
of
the
subscribers
especially
colonel
lumsden
himself
you
will
have
seen
in
the
papers
that
we
are
detained
here
for
a
while
until
we
can
refit
but
when
this
is
done
we
shall
move
northward
i
am
confident
that
during
our
advance
horse
will
do
credit
to
themselves
and
to
india
believe
me
yours
very
truly
signed
a
few
days
after
that
inspection
the
sent
to
colonel
lumsden
a
telegram
he
had
received
from
the
viceroy
lord
secretary
wrote
as
follows
colonel
lumsden
asks
me
to
send
you
the
enclosed
telegram
from
the
viceroy
and
to
say
that
he
fully
agrees
with
the
last
sentence
of
sincerely
cowan
colonel
military
lord
telegram
said
roberts
are
delighted
to
hear
of
your
kind
reception
of
our
indian
volunteer
contingent
and
hope
that
they
may
have
a
chance
of
going
to
the
front
where
we
are
confident
of
their
ability
to
distinguish
carrying
on
the
narrative
from
this
point
but
leaving
the
lighter
incidents
of
life
in
bloemfontein
for
other
pens
to
chronicle
colonel
lumsden
deals
briefly
in
his
diary
with
the
remaining
period
of
a
isolation
and
brings
it
down
to
the
day
when
the
corps
was
to
be
reunited
under
his
command
with
natural
gratification
at
the
position
assigned
to
him
he
says
general
ian
hamilton
is
to
command
a
division
of
mounted
infantry
of
which
colonel
brigade
forms
nearly
a
half
consisting
of
four
corps
of
about
strong
each
we
are
embodied
with
the
mounted
infantry
corps
consisting
of
horse
ourselves
and
various
companies
of
mounted
infantry
from
regular
battalions
under
the
command
of
colonel
ross
both
colonels
ridley
and
ross
are
well
known
in
india
and
we
are
fortunate
in
being
under
their
command
and
in
having
such
a
dashing
divisional
commander
as
general
ian
hamilton
our
first
camp
in
bloemfontein
proved
a
sickly
one
water
being
scarce
owing
to
the
boers
having
blown
up
the
waterworks
and
cut
off
the
main
supply
this
no
doubt
has
been
the
cause
of
numerous
cases
of
dysentery
and
our
camp
was
shifted
yesterday
to
a
healthier
locality
with
a
more
plentiful
water
supply
strange
to
say
we
have
had
an
attack
of
mumps
among
the
men
emanating
we
believe
from
a
native
servant
who
developed
that
disease
on
board
ship
i
regret
to
say
that
captain
beresford
had
to
be
taken
to
hospital
yesterday
suffering
from
an
acute
attack
of
dysentery
but
a
few
days
of
careful
dieting
will
enable
him
to
rejoin
us
i
hope
b
company
owing
to
the
congested
state
of
the
railway
traffic
from
cape
town
to
bloemfontein
was
landed
at
east
london
to
proceed
thence
by
rail
to
join
us
transport
however
was
found
to
be
equally
difficult
by
that
route
and
in
consequence
the
company
had
to
march
the
greater
part
of
the
way
what
meanwhile
had
befallen
that
force
under
the
command
of
major
showers
may
be
told
in
the
words
of
a
trooper
whose
lively
contributions
to
the
daily
do
not
seem
to
have
been
regarded
as
an
infringement
of
a
rule
laid
down
in
the
mobilisation
scheme
by
which
volunteers
for
horse
were
warned
that
they
would
on
no
account
be
allowed
to
act
as
special
correspondents
for
newspapers
this
regulation
like
many
others
seems
to
have
been
more
honoured
in
the
breach
than
the
observance
taking
up
the
broken
thread
where
it
was
dropped
some
pages
back
he
writes
at
town
we
had
a
fairly
pleasant
time
except
on
nights
when
it
simply
rained
cats
and
dogs
and
hailed
as
well
most
of
our
tents
leaked
badly
so
we
were
rendered
thoroughly
uncomfortable
the
horses
and
the
unfortunate
stable
pickets
i
was
one
and
speak
from
personal
experience
were
in
a
wretched
plight
without
shelter
of
any
kind
when
the
storms
were
at
their
worst
and
picketing
pegs
would
not
hold
in
the
soft
ground
we
may
have
used
words
that
were
not
endearing
to
horses
that
got
loose
on
april
we
were
told
that
the
company
would
start
on
the
marching
to
bethulie
waggons
for
our
horses
not
being
available
then
but
that
we
should
probably
entrain
a
few
stations
further
up
we
were
informed
that
all
superfluous
clothing
would
have
to
be
packed
up
and
returned
to
east
london
and
each
man
would
only
be
allowed
to
take
one
kit
bag
weight
not
to
exceed
thirty
pounds
we
therefore
set
to
work
and
cudgelled
our
brains
trying
to
decide
what
to
take
and
what
to
leave
easy
task
i
can
tell
you
however
the
die
was
cast
at
last
and
we
were
ready
for
weighing
next
morning
several
of
the
men
had
evidently
rather
vague
ideas
on
this
point
and
after
filling
their
bags
to
a
weight
of
forty
or
fifty
pounds
each
had
to
repack
them
much
to
their
disgust
we
left
next
day
our
destination
being
baileytown
a
small
place
about
thirteen
miles
distant
we
were
all
of
course
in
full
marching
with
haversacks
bandoliers
rifles
and
the
first
three
were
hung
round
our
shoulders
the
rifles
in
the
bucket
on
the
off
side
of
the
saddle
and
the
slung
to
the
saddle
i
was
not
accustomed
to
it
the
strain
on
the
shoulders
is
pretty
severe
and
we
were
all
glad
when
baileytown
drew
in
sight
this
march
gave
us
a
very
good
opportunity
of
examining
the
country
and
as
we
passed
kopje
after
kopje
it
was
very
easy
to
realise
how
difficult
a
task
it
is
to
dislodge
the
boers
from
their
veritable
strongholds
arriving
at
baileytown
about
and
finding
no
tents
there
we
bivouacked
and
found
the
bare
veldt
no
such
uncomfortable
bed
after
all
we
spent
the
whole
of
the
next
day
there
and
as
very
good
grass
was
plentiful
on
the
slope
of
the
hills
the
opportunity
was
taken
of
and
grazing
the
horses
resumed
our
march
next
day
did
about
miles
by
in
the
afternoon
when
a
halt
was
made
at
a
place
called
sterkstroom
here
to
our
delight
orders
came
for
us
to
be
sent
off
at
once
by
train
we
spent
a
very
busy
afternoon
unloading
kits
from
the
transport
carts
and
reloading
them
into
railway
waggons
and
entraining
horses
the
animals
seem
to
be
getting
reconciled
to
this
constant
training
and
detraining
and
behaved
very
well
indeed
by
we
were
all
ready
to
board
the
train
no
more
luxurious
and
carriages
for
us
poor
privates
now
we
were
packed
like
sardines
in
a
box
into
three
covered
trucks
about
forty
or
fifty
men
in
each
it
was
quite
dark
and
no
lanterns
were
given
us
or
rather
there
was
an
apology
for
a
lantern
in
our
truck
but
it
hardly
made
darkness
visible
kits
and
men
all
over
the
place
and
little
if
any
room
to
very
weary
night
indeed
for
most
of
us
we
arrived
at
burghersdorp
at
next
day
and
stayed
there
about
two
hours
all
sorts
of
rumours
were
current
about
the
close
proximity
of
the
boers
we
were
informed
that
fighting
was
expected
at
a
station
north
of
bethulie
at
this
latter
place
the
troops
had
slept
in
the
trenches
all
night
in
momentary
expectation
of
an
attack
there
were
said
to
be
three
or
four
thousand
boers
hovering
round
in
the
hills
adjacent
to
these
places
having
been
cut
off
in
an
attempt
to
retreat
beyond
bloemfontein
we
did
not
reach
bethulie
till
that
evening
having
to
wait
at
various
sidings
for
down
trains
of
which
there
were
a
good
many
not
expecting
to
detrain
till
the
following
morning
we
had
made
ourselves
as
comfortable
as
circumstances
permitted
for
the
night
when
orders
were
issued
to
get
out
and
encamp
close
by
at
once
in
a
moment
all
was
excitement
orders
ringing
out
constantly
and
men
hurriedly
getting
their
kit
almost
hopeless
task
in
the
darkness
however
it
was
not
long
before
all
the
men
horses
and
kit
were
out
and
on
their
way
to
camp
arrived
there
we
picketed
the
animals
and
by
had
quite
settled
down
for
the
night
no
peace
for
us
however
as
orders
went
round
that
we
must
be
ready
saddled
by
in
case
our
services
should
be
required
it
turned
out
to
be
a
false
alarm
however
so
after
waiting
till
we
took
the
horses
out
to
exercise
bethulie
straggling
along
the
northern
bank
of
orange
river
is
just
on
the
borders
of
the
free
state
the
railway
bridge
an
one
has
been
completely
destroyed
by
boers
and
i
must
say
they
have
done
their
work
very
cleanly
five
out
of
the
eight
spans
have
been
cut
right
through
by
charges
of
dynamite
fortunately
however
there
is
a
waggon
bridge
here
also
which
reinforcements
coming
up
in
time
were
enabled
to
save
from
destruction
and
lines
having
been
placed
across
this
one
truck
at
a
time
is
taken
over
this
important
point
of
communication
is
now
very
strongly
guarded
by
regiments
of
infantry
on
each
side
of
the
river
nearly
all
of
us
took
the
opportunity
of
having
a
glorious
bath
in
the
river
and
did
a
little
amateur
practice
will
make
perfect
no
doubt
but
at
present
we
take
very
kindly
to
it
at
in
the
afternoon
we
got
orders
to
saddle
up
in
readiness
to
march
as
an
escort
to
transport
mules
for
bloemfontein
the
rearguard
came
on
with
our
own
transport
and
as
the
latter
only
move
very
slowly
they
marched
all
night
and
did
not
arrive
at
nineteen
miles
about
fortunately
there
was
brilliant
light
from
the
new
moon
otherwise
the
slow
progress
with
refractory
mules
would
have
been
dreary
indeed
as
it
was
we
marched
along
as
silently
as
possible
and
had
the
feeling
that
we
might
be
attacked
at
any
moment
the
kaffir
drivers
however
could
not
be
restrained
from
shouting
in
shrillest
notes
and
cracking
their
long
thongs
with
sounds
like
as
they
ran
to
head
off
wayward
stragglers
all
night
long
the
red
dust
rose
from
the
hoofs
of
those
mules
in
stifling
clouds
this
is
a
most
country
miles
beyond
miles
without
passing
a
single
human
habitation
towards
the
end
of
the
march
whether
through
sheer
exhaustion
or
from
the
effects
of
the
moonbeams
one
of
our
sages
started
this
theory
next
day
half
the
men
went
to
sleep
in
their
saddles
i
was
one
of
the
somnolent
ones
and
my
horse
took
me
several
yards
in
front
of
the
main
body
and
i
awoke
with
a
start
to
hear
my
companions
silently
chuckling
at
the
situation
the
only
remedy
was
to
get
off
and
march
alongside
our
horses
and
several
of
us
did
this
natives
told
us
afterwards
that
boers
had
been
hanging
on
our
flanks
all
through
that
march
and
the
only
thing
that
saved
us
was
our
which
they
mistook
for
a
the
boers
must
have
changed
a
good
deal
since
then
if
they
could
be
so
easily
deceived
we
left
spytfontein
about
that
morning
and
arrived
at
springfontein
at
in
the
afternoon
here
the
orders
were
for
us
to
start
again
next
morning
escorting
a
maxim
battery
of
four
guns
to
bloemfontein
in
addition
to
the
mules
we
already
had
under
convoy
i
may
mention
that
one
section
of
our
company
always
acted
as
advance
guard
throwing
out
scouts
in
front
and
on
the
flanks
the
duty
of
these
scouts
being
to
search
the
kopjes
on
either
side
of
the
road
and
communicate
with
the
main
body
by
hand
signals
should
any
enemy
appear
in
sight
starting
from
springfontein
early
on
april
we
did
a
march
of
fifteen
miles
to
jagersfontein
here
jim
having
pity
for
my
lameness
took
my
horse
to
water
while
i
in
return
prowled
round
and
found
a
little
house
where
the
womenfolk
agreed
to
let
us
have
tea
i
was
shown
into
the
which
looked
very
cosy
by
comparison
with
the
dreary
veldt
ordered
tea
for
six
and
went
to
gather
my
pals
for
the
feast
after
i
had
groomed
my
horse
fed
him
and
put
his
on
we
went
off
to
the
small
house
but
alas
the
tea
was
all
gone
six
other
men
had
been
there
and
declared
that
i
had
ordered
it
for
them
this
is
the
first
example
of
recorded
to
the
credit
or
otherwise
of
horse
at
next
morning
a
party
of
us
went
out
on
patrol
duty
among
the
surrounding
hills
we
had
our
magazines
loaded
and
in
the
dim
morning
light
it
was
rather
exciting
work
marching
silently
along
with
the
chance
of
meeting
the
enemy
at
any
moment
we
stayed
out
till
about
having
thoroughly
examined
the
surrounding
country
from
the
top
of
a
high
kopje
without
discovering
any
traces
of
boers
after
half
an
hour
for
breakfast
we
started
on
the
march
which
it
was
intended
would
be
a
short
one
of
fifteen
miles
but
it
rained
so
heavily
about
noon
and
for
an
hour
or
two
afterwards
that
on
arrival
at
the
we
found
it
to
be
a
mass
of
liquid
mud
and
grass
and
the
major
decided
to
keep
marching
on
for
edenburg
about
eight
miles
distant
in
the
hope
that
it
would
be
drier
there
but
it
continued
to
pour
steadily
all
the
afternoon
and
we
arrived
to
find
our
camping
ground
at
edenburg
inches
deep
in
water
we
had
no
tents
so
simply
wrapped
ourselves
in
our
blankets
and
slept
where
we
could
many
of
us
woke
an
hour
or
two
afterwards
and
found
ourselves
wet
to
the
bone
and
in
preference
to
trying
to
sleep
again
we
made
a
good
fire
and
sat
round
this
all
night
there
were
a
few
men
of
one
of
the
new
zealand
volunteer
regiments
encamped
here
also
in
charge
of
sick
horses
and
they
very
kindly
supplied
us
with
hot
most
grateful
and
comforting
drink
on
such
a
night
they
gave
us
very
graphic
descriptions
of
hard
times
in
the
field
they
had
seen
lots
of
fighting
being
used
mainly
if
not
entirely
as
scouts
they
told
us
how
difficult
it
was
to
find
the
enemy
who
kept
hidden
among
rocks
on
the
kopjes
and
never
fired
till
our
men
were
within
about
a
hundred
yards
as
soon
as
the
first
shot
was
fired
the
scouts
turned
and
galloped
for
their
lives
and
the
artillery
then
began
to
shell
the
kopjes
next
morning
we
saw
several
boer
prisoners
among
them
being
a
lad
of
about
eighteen
who
had
killed
a
major
in
one
of
our
regiments
while
coming
towards
him
with
a
flag
of
truce
in
his
hand
near
the
place
where
we
had
bivouacked
quantities
of
buried
boer
ammunition
and
guns
were
discovered
we
continued
our
march
at
about
and
encamped
in
the
afternoon
at
a
small
place
called
bethany
here
a
night
attack
was
expected
a
boer
commando
of
several
thousand
men
being
reported
in
the
vicinity
the
men
of
the
maxim
battery
stood
to
their
guns
all
night
on
a
kopje
close
by
and
about
thirty
of
us
accompanied
them
as
an
extra
precaution
cossack
posts
were
also
thrown
out
locusts
of
which
we
had
already
met
several
swarms
on
our
march
up
literally
covered
the
here
and
getting
down
our
backs
and
up
our
sleeves
took
some
dislodging
no
alarm
was
given
so
we
passed
the
night
in
peace
we
resumed
our
march
on
good
friday
and
reaching
kaffir
river
in
the
afternoon
encamped
there
for
the
night
with
regular
highlanders
and
several
others
camps
were
fairly
far
apart
and
after
picketing
horses
drawing
forage
and
eating
our
frugal
meals
we
had
no
time
for
exchanging
visits
or
getting
any
news
from
the
various
regiments
we
met
at
our
however
there
was
consolation
for
us
when
we
received
our
first
budget
of
home
and
indian
letters
one
of
the
men
from
a
company
then
at
bloemfontein
having
been
sent
down
with
them
up
to
this
point
the
march
had
been
across
monotonous
veldt
mostly
flat
treeless
and
uninteresting
here
and
there
where
the
ground
held
moisture
little
pink
flowers
of
a
wood
sorrel
showed
and
nearly
every
mile
one
came
across
some
fresh
variety
of
aster
or
flower
with
composite
crown
shining
brightly
in
the
coarse
grass
occasionally
the
ridges
were
rich
with
clumps
of
heath
scarlet
yellow
and
white
but
not
enough
to
relieve
the
general
dreariness
of
distances
across
which
one
often
looked
in
vain
for
any
sign
of
cultivation
and
the
burrows
of
were
on
all
the
veldt
and
we
had
to
wind
our
way
among
them
following
no
road
but
only
a
track
the
general
direction
of
which
was
marked
by
a
browner
thread
running
across
the
tawny
veldt
several
horses
blundered
into
the
and
brought
their
riders
to
grief
much
to
the
general
amusement
one
trooper
who
rode
ahead
waving
his
hand
and
warning
those
who
followed
by
frequent
cries
of
hole
hole
suddenly
disappeared
and
we
heard
him
groan
as
his
horse
rolled
over
on
top
of
him
one
and
into
it
was
nearly
dark
then
but
dead
horses
mules
and
dying
oxen
marked
the
track
by
which
other
convoys
had
gone
we
felt
glad
that
our
transport
ponies
were
not
to
share
their
fate
they
had
proved
quite
useless
for
drawing
the
heavy
loads
in
this
country
so
we
left
them
behind
at
sterkstroom
sending
all
our
on
by
train
while
we
marched
and
bivouacked
with
only
the
blankets
and
supplies
that
could
be
carried
on
our
own
horses
it
was
at
edenburg
i
think
that
after
a
wet
march
we
got
leave
to
go
into
the
town
hoping
it
might
be
possible
to
get
something
better
than
the
perpetual
and
biscuits
but
the
only
room
we
could
find
in
the
only
decent
hotel
was
wanted
for
officers
however
a
little
man
of
the
derby
militia
came
and
showed
us
a
small
boer
where
we
got
excellent
tea
bread
and
jam
the
derby
man
said
he
knew
where
he
could
buy
some
butter
which
was
all
we
wanted
to
make
us
happy
gave
him
to
go
and
get
it
we
finished
our
meal
without
that
butter
and
the
derby
man
return
so
we
went
back
to
find
everything
in
camp
wet
muddy
and
beastly
to
add
to
our
misery
a
thunderstorm
came
on
and
while
we
wallowed
in
slush
there
were
empty
houses
with
roofs
to
them
not
half
a
mile
off
from
kaffir
river
we
might
easily
have
done
the
distance
to
bloemfontein
in
one
march
as
it
was
only
nineteen
miles
but
there
was
apparently
no
reason
for
hurrying
so
we
spent
one
more
night
in
bivouac
at
kaalspruit
and
on
easter
sunday
in
the
afternoon
marched
through
bloemfontein
to
our
camp
which
was
three
miles
beyond
we
only
got
a
glimpse
of
the
town
in
passing
through
its
central
square
and
along
the
main
street
but
considering
it
was
the
capital
of
the
free
state
i
think
any
of
us
were
very
much
struck
with
it
at
first
sight
colonel
lumsden
and
a
company
welcomed
us
very
warmly
our
tents
were
already
pitched
and
food
prepared
so
we
soon
settled
down
in
our
new
quarters
a
men
receiving
us
as
their
guests
and
treating
us
most
hospitably
there
the
narrative
ends
and
colonel
lumsden
follows
with
a
tribute
to
major
showers
and
the
men
of
b
company
saying
they
made
a
very
plucky
march
up
the
officers
and
men
carrying
nothing
but
their
greatcoats
and
blankets
and
sleeping
out
every
night
in
the
rain
it
was
too
much
of
a
trial
for
the
ponies
to
pull
their
carts
over
the
hilly
and
heavy
going
and
as
i
said
before
this
method
of
transport
had
to
be
abandoned
and
their
carts
and
baggage
railed
up
considering
the
long
and
trying
marches
they
had
undergone
i
consider
both
men
and
horses
looking
wonderfully
fit
a
certain
proportion
of
them
however
were
not
in
condition
to
resume
immediate
work
therefore
to
replace
these
and
in
lieu
of
thirteen
casualties
on
board
ship
and
i
have
procured
from
prince
francis
of
teck
the
remount
officer
argentine
cobs
which
although
not
up
to
the
standard
of
our
indian
mounts
are
nevertheless
a
boon
to
us
in
the
circumstances
in
a
situation
where
horseflesh
is
at
a
premium
a
certain
amount
of
kit
and
necessaries
had
been
lost
by
both
companies
during
our
journey
here
but
it
being
our
first
demand
on
the
military
authorities
for
such
we
had
no
difficulty
in
getting
our
requirements
satisfied
we
are
now
april
under
orders
to
move
for
spytfontein
five
miles
to
the
east
of
karree
siding
station
halting
for
the
night
at
glen
there
has
been
heavy
rain
for
the
past
four
days
and
it
will
be
bad
travelling
especially
crossing
the
drift
at
modder
river
i
have
been
fortunate
in
being
able
to
retain
the
whole
of
our
transport
which
privilege
has
not
been
granted
to
any
other
unit
and
shall
be
complete
in
every
respect
the
men
are
in
keen
spirits
as
our
post
is
to
be
an
advanced
one
and
within
range
of
the
boer
outposts
i
regret
to
say
that
captain
beresford
is
no
better
and
will
i
fear
have
to
be
invalided
home
chapter
vii
of
the

regiment
on
long
streets
and
deep
in
mud
or
dust
a
low
cottage
with
vines
trailing
about
its
posts
here
and
there
between
long
rows
of
featureless
shops
a
large
market
square
where
no
farm
produce
is
displayed
a
club
frequented
by
british
officers
who
have
little
time
to
lounge
several
churches
of
the
primmest
dutch
type
with
tall
steeples
that
cut
sharply
against
the
clear
sky
in
lines
uncompromisingly
straight
some
public
buildings
pretentious
without
grace
or
beauty
on
one
side
a
steep
hill
terraced
with
houses
of
which
little
but
the
corrugated
iron
roofs
can
be
seen
on
the
other
roads
that
straggle
off
to
level
outskirts
where
villas
painfully
new
stand
in
the
midst
of
flowerless
gardens
surrounded
by
barbed
wire
these
were
the
first
impressions
of
bloemfontein
gathered
by
horse
and
few
troopers
had
any
opportunity
to
modify
these
impressions
in
more
favourable
circumstances
afterwards
the
camp
to
which
a
company
went
originally
at
rietfontein
was
within
two
miles
of
the
town
and
might
have
been
pleasant
enough
if
thousands
of
hoofs
had
not
cut
up
its
turf
and
the
ground
had
not
been
used
as
a
for
rubbish
which
boer
commandos
could
not
turn
to
any
use
some
of
them
had
been
there
before
horse
and
several
british
regiments
also
so
many
tens
of
thousands
of
soldiers
were
camped
round
about
the
town
that
they
may
have
interrupted
the
currents
of
salubrious
air
which
made
bloemfontein
famous
in
other
days
as
a
resort
for
invalids
there
were
plenty
of
invalids
to
be
seen
there
in
the
early
weeks
of
april
but
they
did
not
regard
it
as
the
best
type
of
sanatorium
and
men
who
had
to
sleep
in
small
tents
on
the
reeking
ground
of
rietfontein
would
not
willingly
go
there
again
in
search
of
health
they
had
hardly
begun
to
realise
how
serious
was
the
stoppage
of
a
fresh
water
supply
which
the
boers
had
cut
off
from
the
main
at
modder
river
hundreds
of
old
wells
existed
in
the
town
and
its
outskirts
and
by
opening
these
enough
water
could
be
drawn
for
immediate
wants
but
alas
the
water
had
been
undisturbed
since
bloemfontein
began
to
draw
its
supply
from
the
distant
waterworks
some
six
or
seven
years
earlier
what
impurities
had
drained
into
the
wells
during
all
that
time
nobody
knew
until
hospitals
filled
rapidly
with
patients
suffering
from
enteric
and
dysentery
rietfontein
was
showing
symptoms
of
an
outbreak
and
so
after
a
week
under
canvas
there
horse
got
the
welcome
order
to
strike
camp
and
form
a
new
one
some
three
miles
farther
north
by
farm
where
a
clear
spruit
flows
over
its
bed
of
white
gravel
between
banks
that
are
shaded
by
tall
eucalyptus
trees
and
drooping
sallows
after
days
on
duty
in
which
they
were
not
allowed
to
be
slack
troopers
felt
little
inclination
for
walking
the
four
or
five
miles
to
bloemfontein
which
did
not
become
more
cheerful
as
the
number
of
troops
increased
except
for
the
traders
who
were
rapidly
getting
back
all
they
had
lost
by
the
war
and
a
great
deal
more
officers
had
always
the
chance
whenever
they
could
get
away
from
camp
for
an
hour
or
two
of
pleasant
social
meetings
at
the
bloemfontein
club
where
generals
regimental
commanders
and
company
officers
from
other
brigades
came
together
for
a
little
while
at
lunch
or
afternoon
tea
and
exchanged
all
the
rumours
that
could
be
told
in
a
few
they
were
many
it
was
a
place
of
strange
meetings
men
from
the
uttermost
corners
of
the
earth
who
had
perhaps
not
seen
each
other
for
years
foregathered
there
only
to
separate
a
little
later
and
go
on
their
ways
with
different
columns
none
knew
whither
troopers
had
similar
experiences
in
the
streets
and
inns
of
bloemfontein
where
nearly
every
regimental
badge
of
the
british
army
and
every
distinguishing
plume
adopted
by
irregulars
who
had
come
to
fight
as
of
the
were
to
be
seen
in
a
variety
that
seemed
endless
brothers
whose
paths
in
life
had
parted
when
they
left
school
one
going
east
another
west
or
south
came
face
to
face
in
the
streets
of
that
little
free
state
town
or
rubbed
shoulders
in
a
motley
crowd
of
soldiers
sometimes
without
recognising
each
other
until
accident
gave
them
some
clue
a
rough
word
or
two
of
careless
greeting
a
tight
a
steadfast
look
into
eyes
that
remind
the
boys
of
father
or
mother
a
light
laugh
on
lips
that
might
otherwise
betray
too
much
feeling
a
drink
together
if
it
is
to
be
had
for
lang
syne
and
then
with
a
jaunty
long
old
chap
they
part
again
it
is
a
superstition
or
at
any
rate
a
recognised
custom
not
to
say
in
such
circumstances
but
if
men
only
thought
of
its
literal
meaning
what
better
wish
could
there
be
yet
for
all
its
stir
and
bustle
and
dramatic
incidents
bloemfontein
was
a
dull
place
in
those
days
for
any
man
who
entered
it
and
found
no
intimate
friends
there
to
greet
him
comrades
they
all
were
but
in
a
sort
of
comradeship
that
needed
the
fire
of
the
battlefield
to
try
it
and
perchance
anneal
it
into
something
stronger
than
the
ties
of
mere
kinship
but
this
is
a
thing
which
only
soldiers
understand
and
seldom
even
they
horse
knew
it
not
then
but
for
some
of
them
the
secret
was
to
be
disclosed
before
many
days
had
passed
and
in
a
form
that
will
never
fade
from
their
memory
meanwhile
they
went
about
their
duties
methodically
enough
in
camp
or
took
their
pleasures
sadly
in
streets
where
thousands
of
soldiers
wandered
daily
finding
no
entertainment
no
place
of
resort
except
dingy
bars
where
liquors
of
more
than
alcoholic
potency
were
sold
and
very
little
change
from
campaign
fare
except
at
a
price
that
made
even
the
necessaries
of
life
prohibited
luxuries
for
a
man
who
had
no
more
than
his
shilling
a
day
to
spend
one
of
horse
who
was
sent
into
bloemfontein
on
orderly
duty
gives
a
vivid
sketch
of
all
this
in
a
few
touches
that
are
the
more
graphic
because
they
only
pretend
to
note
passing
impressions
writing
a
day
after
b
arrival
at
farm
he
shows
how
the
men
had
to
rub
their
horses
down
while
standing
inches
deep
in
mud
so
much
rain
was
out
of
season
but
south
africa
is
like
other
places
occasionally
fickle
in
this
respect
to
troopers
it
did
not
seem
an
ideal
way
of
spending
easter
monday
and
the
whistle
of
which
officers
made
free
use
must
have
been
irritating
to
nerves
already
overstrained
for
it
is
never
mentioned
without
a
forcible
prefix
however
when
rain
ceased
and
sunshine
appeared
for
an
hour
in
the
afternoon
these
men
were
merry
enough
at
a
game
of
cricket
which
by
violating
all
the
higher
rules
must
have
reminded
them
of
similar
sports
in
england
when
they
were
boys
and
welcomed
easter
monday
as
the
day
of
all
others
appropriate
to
cricket
the
next
morning
a
great
cheer
rolled
from
camp
to
camp
and
horse
responding
lustily
passed
it
on
to
the
next
without
asking
what
the
unusual
excitement
meant
when
they
heard
afterwards
that
troops
were
cheering
because
had
surrendered
a
strange
depression
took
hold
of
them
at
that
moment
all
the
discomforts
and
drudgery
of
a
life
were
forgotten
in
the
humiliating
thought
that
the
corps
would
have
to
go
back
to
india
without
a
chance
of
proving
itself
in
battle
it
turned
out
however
to
be
all
mere
rumour
though
not
so
baseless
as
some
of
which
horse
had
the
transvaal
offer
to
negotiate
for
peace
on
terms
all
in
his
own
favour
must
have
been
known
in
england
then
and
in
some
mysterious
way
a
reflex
of
it
came
to
camps
on
the
veldt
where
troops
who
had
seen
plenty
of
the
fighting
that
horse
were
eager
for
welcomed
the
illusive
tidings
with
a
cheer
in
its
train
however
came
something
nearly
as
post
bringing
letters
from
home
and
beauty
and
for
one
officer
at
least
parcel
full
of
excellent
before
he
had
time
to
enjoy
these
he
was
under
orders
for
bloemfontein
and
after
a
ride
through
pouring
rain
he
got
there
in
time
to
hear
another
disconcerting
rumour
and
to
find
some
of
his
comrades
selling
their
kit
because
had
been
ordered
wisely
resolving
not
to
act
on
anything
but
definite
orders
and
taking
the
advice
of
a
corporal
in
the
city
imperial
volunteers
who
persuaded
him
sit
tight
he
waited
making
the
best
of
circumstances
that
were
by
no
means
bright
according
to
his
own
brief
record
which
runs
dinner
to
be
had
at
the
station
got
tea
sixpence
a
cup
bread
and
jam
hungry
and
dispirited
he
turned
in
and
went
to
bed
at
the
station
which
means
something
very
different
from
the
untravelled
idea
of
a
bed
then
next
morning
a
worth
of
oat
straw
for
and
fed
him
put
my
wet
things
out
to
dry
and
sallied
forth
to
the
station
had
an
excellent
breakfast
porridge
haddock
chops
and
two
cups
of
coffee
for
three
shillings
went
to
the
hospital
to
try
and
get
my
leg
dressed
but
find
anybody
to
speak
to
thence
to
a
most
pleasant
dutchman
went
to
the
station
for
three
not
a
profitable
work
for
a
corporal
on
cavalry
pay
without
after
that
came
tea
and
dinner
so
that
he
was
evidently
doing
his
best
to
prove
the
wisdom
of
mark
philosophy
having
found
circumstances
in
which
it
was
a
credit
to
be
jolly
he
made
the
most
of
them
it
is
not
every
soldier
however
who
having
indulged
in
a
little
extravagance
of
that
kind
could
write
to
the
bank
and
had
an
agreeable
interview
with
the
nor
every
man
with
a
balance
to
his
credit
who
would
have
turned
cheerfully
again
towards
the
rough
life
of
a
camp
and
the
unknown
hardships
that
were
to
follow
when
orders
came
next
day
for
all
horse
to
rejoin
their
corps
in
readiness
for
an
immediate
advance
this
officer
paid
another
visit
to
his
friend
the
chemist
and
asked
how
much
he
owed
chemist
refused
to
take
anything
pretty
good
that
for
a
dutchman
and
evidently
a
with
that
pleasant
experience
blotting
out
all
unfavourable
impressions
of
bloemfontein
the
corporal
rode
back
to
camp
at
farm
to
find
all
the
tents
being
struck
so
they
had
to
spend
a
miserable
night
by
the
bivouac
fire
and
get
what
amusement
they
could
out
of
good
stories
one
suggested
perhaps
by
talk
of
chemists
and
surgical
operations
is
worthy
to
be
preserved
to
appreciate
the
point
of
the
joke
you
must
know
that
a
badges
of
rank
are
a
sword
and
bâton
crossed
with
the
crown
above
them
a
man
of
the
yeomanry
then
quartered
in
bloemfontein
was
suffering
agonies
from
toothache
and
like
our
friend
the
corporal
had
searched
every
hospital
in
vain
for
a
surgeon
who
might
have
leisure
to
extract
it
as
he
crossed
the
market
square
a
general
of
division
whose
kindness
of
heart
is
as
notorious
as
his
strength
of
language
was
coming
out
of
the
club
to
him
the
yeoman
advanced
and
after
a
hesitating
preface
asked
the
general
whether
he
would
mind
drawing
a
tooth
for
a
moment
the
general
was
dumbfounded
but
then
his
powers
of
expression
came
back
to
him
the
devil
do
you
mean
he
roared
thinking
the
yeoman
was
unpardonably
familiar
the
face
fell
very
sorry
sir
he
said
our
on
leave
said
the
officer
smiling
at
the
mistake
not
a
doctor
general
the
yeoman
stammered
badge
sir
the
general
turned
his
shoulder
to
the
abashed
trooper
you
are
my
lad
the
matter
with
the
badge
swords
bâton
and
heavens
said
the
man
hope
forgive
me
sir
i
thought
it
was
the
skull
and
illustration
kapp
transport
and
water
carts
before
daybreak
in
the
morning
of
april
horse
were
roused
to
pack
kits
and
saddle
up
for
their
march
impartial
observers
said
they
were
very
smart
about
it
but
a
story
went
round
that
the
colonel
had
expressed
himself
as
much
disappointed
with
b
company
saying
that
the
others
would
have
saddled
up
and
walked
round
them
three
times
this
was
apparently
only
a
playful
invention
but
it
so
angered
one
trooper
that
he
could
only
express
his
feelings
in
choice
hindustani
he
was
mollified
afterwards
on
learning
that
a
company
had
really
admired
the
soldierly
way
in
which
b
company
got
ready
and
then
he
excused
his
strong
language
by
writing
understand
now
the
expression
like
a
we
hear
and
do
more
of
it
every
it
was
a
painful
confession
for
one
of
horse
to
make
but
the
incident
apparently
trivial
shows
that
a
wholesome
spirit
of
emulation
in
deeds
was
animating
the
men
and
that
would
always
be
regarded
by
soldiers
as
ample
atonement
for
unnecessary
rivalry
in
linguistic
attainments
the
time
was
close
at
hand
too
when
horse
would
have
more
serious
things
to
think
about
than
these
yet
nobody
knows
better
than
old
campaigners
how
little
things
occupy
the
thoughts
of
men
even
when
they
are
doing
great
deeds
no
opportunity
for
achieving
greatness
came
to
the
corps
during
its
first
march
through
a
country
where
the
appearance
might
be
looked
for
at
any
moment
but
in
another
way
the
men
showed
their
fitness
for
a
helping
the
transport
out
of
difficulties
it
was
in
crossing
a
drift
at
the
little
modder
river
that
carts
stuck
with
wheels
jammed
tightly
in
deep
holes
between
slippery
boulders
and
teams
floundered
in
fruitless
attempts
to
recover
their
footing
the
editor
having
been
in
one
of
those
holes
horse
and
all
has
reason
to
remember
the
place
and
the
swirl
of
water
where
it
rashes
over
rocky
ledges
into
a
deeper
pool
by
dint
of
manful
work
horse
got
their
carts
clear
of
the
drift
only
to
find
them
axle
deep
in
the
treacherous
soil
of
a
neighbouring
vlei
some
minutes
later
then
ammunition
had
to
be
taken
out
and
carried
to
firm
ground
and
carts
lifted
bodily
out
of
the
mire
it
was
an
experience
by
which
the
transport
drivers
learned
not
to
trust
appearances
and
to
beware
of
grass
that
looked
unusually
green
still
as
sergeant
stephens
of
the
transport
wrote
in
relating
his
experiences
anything
ever
frightened
our
drivers
it
was
the
word
you
should
have
seen
the
worried
looks
when
they
heard
there
was
a
drift
that
night
the
corps
bivouacked
beyond
glen
where
general
division
had
been
in
touch
with
the
enemy
for
nearly
a
month
and
warding
off
frequent
attempts
to
interfere
with
engineers
who
were
hard
at
work
on
a
near
the
ruined
railway
bridge
there
they
had
to
bivouac
with
nothing
but
blankets
to
protect
them
from
the
bitterly
cold
wind
and
they
went
to
sleep
supperless
because
the
transport
delayed
by
many
causes
had
not
come
up
no
alarms
or
excursions
disturbed
their
rest
that
night
but
their
march
next
morning
was
to
the
accompaniment
of
distant
and
heavier
guns
and
the
sounds
of
fighting
not
far
off
they
did
not
know
the
meaning
of
it
all
then
it
seemed
to
them
but
a
local
skirmish
and
not
the
penultimate
phase
of
a
great
movement
in
which
ian
hamilton
french
and
rundle
had
been
sweeping
the
boers
before
them
from
wepener
to
thaba
and
thence
eastward
and
northward
clearing
the
country
for
a
still
greater
movement
no
shots
came
near
the
marching
column
the
screen
of
outposts
holding
inquisitive
boers
in
check
was
miles
away
from
the
drift
where
horse
crossed
the
main
modder
river
and
for
all
they
could
see
it
might
have
been
still
miles
off
when
they
marched
up
a
steep
track
and
bivouacked
on
the
pleasant
hillside
relieving
some
new
south
wales
mounted
rifles
whose
horses
had
been
used
up
by
incessant
patrolling
they
were
however
in
the
outpost
line
there
as
part
of
the
mounted
infantry
commanded
by
colonel
ross
to
whom
colonel
lumsden
reported
himself
that
afternoon
some
officers
of
regular
regiments
whose
pickets
were
near
at
hand
came
to
have
a
look
at
these
indian
volunteers
who
were
quite
gratified
afterwards
to
hear
that
the
colonel
of
the
norfolks
thought
them
very
fine
set
of
men
but
it
was
true
enough
they
had
not
much
discipline
of
the
type
but
they
were
held
together
by
bonds
stronger
than
any
rules
or
regulations
can
weld
and
inspired
by
a
sentiment
that
would
have
made
them
the
wherever
fortune
might
place
them
and
part
of
that
game
was
for
them
to
be
soldiers
in
deed
as
well
as
in
spirit
though
they
might
lack
the
mere
outward
show
of
subordination
spytfontein
which
formed
the
centre
of
a
position
held
by
horse
is
an
outwork
of
the
rugged
range
that
sweeps
from
east
to
west
in
an
irregular
curve
just
north
of
karree
siding
and
from
which
general
division
aided
by
a
turning
movement
of
cavalry
and
mounted
infantry
under
general
french
dislodged
the
boers
a
month
earlier
though
they
had
made
several
attempts
to
reoccupy
that
range
in
the
hope
of
being
able
to
shell
us
out
of
glen
they
lost
ground
each
time
and
finally
retired
to
an
entrenched
position
in
front
of
brandfort
to
which
spytfontein
was
our
nearest
approach

in
one
of
his
clever
letters
to
the

an
admirable
sketch
of
outpost
work
when
it
was
a
new
experience
to
horse
spytfontein
consists
of
several
kopjes
with
rocks
between
and
so
far
as
i
could
see
only
one
farmhouse
so
you
will
not
find
it
marked
on
the
map
we
took
the
place
of
some
australians
as
they
had
been
pretty
busy
and
their
horses
were
all
knocked
up
to
the
north
of
us
were
horse
about
yards
off
and
quite
close
to
our
southern
flank
were
some
companies
of
east
lancashire
mounted
infantry
what
with
outlying
pickets
guards
horse
pickets
and
such
like
we
did
not
find
time
hang
heavy
on
our
hands
and
as
our
nearest
neighbours
over
the
kopjes
were
large
bodies
of
boers
with
heavy
guns
and
other
arms
we
had
as
the
saying
is
to
sleep
with
one
eye
open
and
that
one
well
skinned
i
have
many
a
time
steered
my
way
by
old
crux
away
down
south
but
i
found
that
gazing
at
it
over
the
muzzle
of
a
was
though
possibly
just
as
profitable
and
useful
a
job
very
much
less
romantic
one
reads
in
olive
schreiner
and
in
other
african
books
of
the
pleasure
of
sleeping
out
on
the
great
south
african
veldt
the
pale
calm
moon
overhead
and
only
the
shade
of
the
waggon
for
covering
around
which
the
trek
oxen
rest
after
their
toil
the
monotonous
crunch
crunch
of
their
jaws
as
they
chew
the
cud
being
the
only
sound
that
breaks
the
silence
my
personal
experience
was
winds
little
or
no
moon
wet
grass
and
rocks
to
lie
upon
soaking
wet
feet
and
clothes
one
wet
blanket
and

only

this

four
hours
illustration
outlying
picket
taking
up
position
a
sketch
by
we
were
not
allowed
to
walk
about
as
on
ordinary
but
had
to
keep
quiet
and
sit
or
lie
down
for
the
most
of
the
time
with
our
eyes
straining
out
into
the
dark
north
where
every
piece
of
scrub
or
large
stone
rapidly
grew
into
a
boer
as
our
brains
became
hypnotised
with
ceaseless
gazing
and
on
our
keen
sense
of
hearing
and
sight
depended
the
lives
of
all
the
corps
one
afternoon
the
alarm
was
given
and
we
promptly
to
in
excited
expectation
of
an
attack
but
it
proved
to
be
a
false
alarm
and
i
was
not
surprised
that
it
was
so
as
our
valiant
signaller
standing
on
the
of
a
neighbouring
kopje
flagged
the
news
down
to
us
and
of
course
all
the
boers
between
our
pickets
and
kroonstad
at
once
knew
that
horse
were
awake
they
thought
better
of
it
some
few
days
afterwards
we
got
orders
to
parade
at
to
take
part
in
an
attack
on
a
boer
force
which
had
been
on
some
hills
to
the
of
us
and
skirting
the
modder
river
i
was
horse
sentry
that
night
so
got
practically
no
sleep
at
however
amid
a
thundercloud
of
english
and
hindustani
horse
awoke
and
managed
to
saddle
up
in
the
darkness
and
then
by
dint
of
shouting
out
each
names
we
managed
to
wriggle
into
our
proper
subsections
as
one
man
put
it
bundabust
was
from
the
midst
of
this
noisy
dark
chaos
emerging
away
we
marched
bitterly
cold
and
cheerless
was
that
morning
every
second
teeth
chattering
like
so
many
castanets
while
feet
felt
with
the
stirrup
irons
in
a
short
time
we
were
joined
by
horse
the
victorian
mounted
rifles
the
artillery
and
lancashire
mounted
infantry
and
silence
was
the
strict
order
of
the
march
and
silence
it
was
pretty
well
until
one
of
horse
with
his
open
let
bang
two
phew
went
the
two
nickels
over
the
lot
of
us
and
half
of
us
our
reverently
i
believe
loch
got
fourteen
for
that
and
served
him
jolly
well
right
the
sun
coming
out
our
spirits
rose
somewhat
and
our
fingers
became
warm
enough
to
pull
out
bits
of
biscuit
from
our
haversacks
and
so
have
a
sumptuous
breakfast
on
horseback
an
hour
and
a
march
brought
us
to
a
deep
creek
with
a
good
drift
over
it
and
this
we
crossed
in
safety
on
the
other
side
we
found
a
long
and
broad
expanse
of
plain
gradually
sloping
up
to
a
ridge
of
high
kopjes
some
four
miles
in
front
of
us
on
these
kopjes
our
friends
the
boers
were
supposed
to
be
waiting
for
us
so
we
spread
out
into
extended
single
ranks
with
about
eleven
yards
interval
a
kind
friend
having
given
me
a
cheroot
i
lit
up
and
enjoyed
a
peaceful
smoke
while
at
the
same
time
i
could
not
help
wondering
how
many
more
smokes
the
boers
would
allow
me
to
have
shortly
afterwards
we
got
the
order
to
advance
at
the
canter
which
we
did
as
our
scouts
were
barely
yards
ahead
and
had
not
had
time
to
the
kopjes
properly
this
was
in
my
opinion
a
risky
order
however
we
got
there
firing
had
meanwhile
commenced
on
our
left
and
two
of
our
victorian
scouts
were
bagged
our
and
guns
then
tuned
up
boom
after
a
little
of
this
tune
the
boers
bolted
and
left
us
in
possession
skirting
along
the
banks
of
the
modder
river
we
at
length
reached
waggon
bridge
over
which
my
subsection
took
the
lead
as
scouts
and
about
midday
arrived
at
a
boer
farm
some
two
and
a
half
miles
further
on
here
we
stayed
the
night
camping
out
on
some
commanding
kopjes
a
strict
watch
was
of
course
kept
up
all
night
next
day
we
duly
received
some
nice
compliments
from
the
general
in
command
on
our
rapid
march
and
successful
capture
of
waggon
bridge
and
then
like
the
celebrated
duke
of
army
we
marched
back
again
to
our
camp
an
officer
of
the
corps
writing
to
friends
at
calcutta
adds
some
interesting
details
we
are
right
up
at
the
front
now
holding
a
line
of
kopjes
overlooking
a
large
plain
all
round
there
is
nothing
in
the
plain
except
one
or
two
small
kopjes
occupied
by
the
boers
between
here
and
brandfort
they
come
close
in
every
night
and
often
do
a
little
sniping
at
our
outposts
but
they
disappear
at
daybreak
the
other
morning
four
australians
went
out
to
a
farm
about
three
miles
off
there
were
supposed
to
be
only
women
there
and
they
had
a
couple
of
white
flags
up
but
as
soon
as
the
first
man
got
into
the
yard
several
boers
jumped
out
of
the
pigsty
shot
his
horse
wounded
him
and
took
him
others
had
to
clear
they
say
about
a
dozen
boers
come
there
every
night
the
australians
have
a
picket
a
mile
off
but
they
have
not
succeeded
in
catching
anybody
the
general
allow
firing
into
the
farm
because
he
says
the
women
help
the
boers
coming
for
supplies
and
things
the
farm
where
we
get
our
milk
and
stuff
is
owned
by
a
boer
who
has
given
up
his
arms
he
fought
against
us
and
bucks
that
he
shot
a
gordon
highlander
officer
at
ten
paces
at
magersfontein
this
boer
was
in
an
awful
funk
lest
his
old
friends
should
reach
his
farm
and
shoot
him
at
least
he
said
so
the
night
before
last
our
sentries
on
one
of
the
pickets
were
quite
certain
they
saw
our
boer
friend
and
our
signallers
on
the
kopje
noticed
it
also
twenty
boers
were
seen
in
the
distance
in
the
afternoon
and
he
was
evidently
signalling
to
them
there
was
a
quantity
of
ammunition
found
in
one
of
his
kraals
so
he
will
probably
find
himself
in
chokee
the
day
before
i
rejoined
from
hospital
we
attacked
or
rather
the
boers
attacked
us
but
were
shelled
out
of
their
position
two
of
our
officers
who
were
left
in
camp
saw
from
one
kopje
a
shell
burst
in
the
middle
of
five
men
and
saw
them
all
go
down
on
the
when
our
men
were
sent
away
to
the
right
with
some
other
and
the
cheshires
to
seize
a
bridge
and
to
drive
boer
raiders
from
some
kopjes
they
did
not
apparently
wait
to
be
turned
out
but
cleared
and
trekked
across
the
plain
to
brandfort
our
men
never
fired
a
shot
though
horse
on
their
left
had
a
little
shooting
and
lost
one
man
an
advance
scout
the
boers
let
him
walk
right
into
their
midst
and
as
he
turned
round
to
bolt
his
horse
came
down
and
they
took
him
prisoner
our
position
is
about
as
far
as
i
can
make
out
the
centre
of
a
half
circle
from
karree
siding
to
the
glen
one
quarter
circle
is
held
by
the
division
two
batteries
and
various
the
other
afternoon
some
boers
started
sniping
at
our
but
came
nowhere
near
hitting
we
all
stood
to
arms
and
when
thirty
men
were
sent
out
they
cleared
they
generally
amuse
themselves
sniping
at
our
outposts
at
something
like
yards
with
no
effect
we
have
to
furnish
three
night
officers
five
and
sixty
men
every
night
it
falls
rather
hard
on
the
section
officers
as
one
is
sick
and
the
company
commanders
and
the
staff
of
course
do
it
so
it
means
three
of
the
seven
are
out
every
night
there
is
not
very
much
to
do
on
picket
except
post
the
sentries
visit
them
two
or
three
times
in
the
night
and
get
them
in
again
a
little
before
sunrise
when
they
return
to
camp
there
is
also
a
day
outpost
of
twenty
men
and
two
officers
and
generally
a
convoy
of
similar
size
into
karree
siding
so
the
men
too
have
enough
to
do
there
was
a
fight
expected
but
it
has
not
come
off
only
a
few
shots
on
our
left
the
order
has
just
come
for
us
to
go
out
leaving
a
sufficient
guard
to
strike
our
tents
and
bring
them
on
if
necessary
we
hope
it
is
the
real
advance

time

we
lost
poor

roger
at
kruger
siding
on
the
way
up
he
had
quite
turned
into
a
regimental
dog
and
on
the
march
used
generally
to
come
along
with
the
rearguard
we
halted
to
feed
there
one
march
and
he
may
have
stopped
with
the
royal
scots
it
is
quite
possible
he
went
back
to
jagersfontein
and
made
up
to
the
gloucester
yeomanry
they
are
bringing
in
two
of
our
lame
horses
so
if
he
did
we
may
get
him
again

how
often
ignorant
critics
have
sneered
at
that
phrase
baptism
of
fire
which
expresses
finely
with
literary
completeness
and
force
a
truth
of
which
men
who
have
never
been
in
the
front
line
of
battle
can
know
nothing
however
much
the
phrase
may
have
been
degraded
by
melodramatic
application
it
is
a
gem

its
clearness
of

perfection

is
a
plunge
from
which
he
emerges
a
new
being
whether
the
change
may
be
for
better
or
worse
depends
probably
on
temperament
and
previous
associations
the
fire
of
battle
does
not
purify
a
sinner
or
sear
the
soul
of
a
saint
but
neither
is
quite
the
same
after
as
he
was
before
passing
through
it
he
has
seen
things
which
in
some
subtle
way
unfelt
perhaps
and
certainly
unacknowledged
will
influence
the
remaining
years
of
his
life
it
is
not
only
because
he
has
looked
death
in

a
common
enough
experience
elsewhere

has
stood
where
dear

of
scenes
that
at
other
times
would
be
heartrending

if
in

from
himself
he
has
passed
callous
through
it
all
the
braver
a
man
is
the
more
surely
some
consciousness
of
that
strange
state
clings
to
him
to
call
it
selfish
indifference
or
the
numbness
of
fear
as
some
insolent
ignoramus
might
would
be
to
falsify
the
history
of

selfish
men

feeling

sense
was
for

for

hour
it
may
be
dead
the
mental
faculties
were
clear
clear

that
they
took
impressions

and

of

with

two

examples
which
occurred
within
my
knowledge
if
not
both
within
my
actual
range
of
vision
on
the
battlefield
of
elandslaagte
one
was
when
the
imperial
light
horse
were
rushing
up
the
last
slope
to
that
wonderful
rallying
cry
of
theirs
in
an
onslaught
that
rolled
like
a
resistless
wave
across
the
crest
and
crowned
the
day
with
victory
one
trooper
dropped
out
of
the
ranks
as
if
a
bullet
had
struck
him
yet
he
knew
that
only
his
legs
had
given
way
suddenly
refusing
to
carry
him
any
further
speaking
frankly
of
this
incident
afterwards
he
said
that
at
the
moment
no
thought
in
his
mind
was
so
strong
as
the
desire
to
be
with
those
who
were
charging
up
the
stony
heights
waved
on
by
their
intrepid
colonel
chisholm
he
had
no
sensation
that
could
be
akin
to
fear
and
yet
he
was
powerless
to
move
a
limb
then
suddenly
a
strange
thing
happened
a
mauser
bullet
ploughed
along
his
cheek
and
stung
him
in
another
moment
mind
and
body
were
leaping
together
up
that
hill
each
striving
to
be
first
in
the
race
and
behaving
with
a
gallantry
at
which
even
brave
men
wondered
but
for
that
accidental
shot
the
trooper
might
have
stopped
where
he
fell
and
been
branded
as
a
coward
the
other
illustration
occurred
almost
simultaneously
but
in
a
different
way
some
wounded
men
of
the
same
dauntless
corps
were
lying
on
an
opposite
slope
exposed
to
a
heavy
fire
from
some
boers
who
had
crept
back
to
a
rocky
ledge
from
which
they
were
raking
the
whole
of
that
ground
with
a
shower
of
nickel
john
stuart
of
the
post
and
i
went
to
help
two
or
three
who
were
too
badly
hit
to
move
and
succeeded
in
getting
them
from
the
bare
veldt
to
comparative
safety
behind
small
boulders
one
of
them
told
me
afterwards
that
his
mind
was
full
of
nothing
but
profound
gratitude
and
admiration
when
he
saw
us
tucking
a
comrade
into
one
little
sheltered
nook
and
yet
the
words
that
his
tongue
all
the
while
hurled
at
us
for
our
folly
in
not
taking
cover
were
quite
unfit
for
publication
no
man
can
pass
through
experiences
of
that
kind
and
be
in
all
things
the
same
again
the
of
has
changed
him
though
he
may
never
admit
it
to
himself
or
betray
it
to
his
friends
and
the
time
was
at
hand
when
horse
were
to
take
their
plunge
and
emerge
from
it
with
the
reputation
of
soldiers
in
whom
trust
could
be
placed
from
that
day
forward
the
share
they
had
in
operations
that
extended
over
a
front
of
nearly
thirty
miles
from
thaba
to
ospruit
was
comparatively
small
but
for
them
it
was
the
most
eventful
episode
of
the
first
fight
their
passing
of
the
threshold
beyond
which
was
the
secret
of
more
of
human
life
than
they
had
ever
known
in
that
one
day
they
were
to
look
death
in
the
face
to
see
comrades
the
friends
of
their
youth
fall
beside
them
to
have
thoughts
of
sorrow
in
their
minds
but
no
pang
in
their
hearts
grief
was
to
come
days
perhaps
months
afterwards
when
a
chance
word
or
the
touch
of
a
hand
might
set
the
currents
flowing
in
channels
that
war
had
closed
above
all
they
were
to
know
the
british
soldier
as
he
is
in
creature
of
strange
impulses
of
wonderful
tenderness
when
he
might
be
expected
to
show
the
roughest
qualities
with
which
habit
has
endowed
him
and
of
sublime
endurance

the
plunge

bad
in
fact
change
the
scene
and
what
do
we
see
mile
after
mile
of
thin
red
line
now
changed
to
dirty
khaki
the
battered
khaki
helmet
only
pillow
at
night
the
coarse
hard
ammunition
boots
dirt
and
vermin
cover
him
from
head
to
water
to
drink
much
less
to
wash
heavy
marching
kit
rifle
and
cartridges
and
as
for
food
why
not
enough
to
feed
a
dog
ay
many
and
many
are
the
dogs
that
would
have
refused
south

with
noses
overhead
at
times
a
scorching

at

a
blinding
cold
blustering

and
at

always
the
bleak
cold
wind
march
march
march
on
they
go
bravely
truly
sturdily
hardly
a
grumble
while
safely
at
home
you
have
your
renegade
telling
us
of
the
atrocities
these
brave
men
are
committing
lies
all
lies
i
say
met
some
of
those
people
since
i
came
back
and
my
one
wish
has
been
to
have
them
out
against
a
brick
wall
with
six
good
brave
tommies
to
fire
a
volley
yes
i
am
glad
ay
more
than
glad
spite
of
wounds
and
hardships
that
i
have
seen
our
good
brothers
of
the
khaki
as
they
ought
to
be
swell
uniforms
there
no
pipeclay
no
shining
cuirasses
and
polished
helmets
to
with
a
public
ye
gods
no
all
khaki
khaki
all
one
great
army
be
it
a
colonial
be
it
a
london
slum
or
a
highland
bracken
born
lot
of
men
they
are
all
brothers
in
arms
one
in
object
one
in
deeds
of
bravery
and
devotion
to
an
empire
that
eloquent
passage
written
by
trooper
gentleman
and
should
be
enough
to
silence
the
tongue
of
calumny
and
convince
any
unprejudiced
mind
that
whatever
war
may
do
it
does
not
brutalise
in
illustration
of
that
truth
many
other
instances
will
have
to
be
given
before
this
narrative
runs
its
course
to
an
end
now
however
it
is
necessary
to
describe
briefly
the
general
scope
of
operations
whereby
horse
were
drawn
much
sooner
than
they
had
any
hope
of
into
their
first
fight
attempts
had
been
made
by
generals
rundle
ian
hamilton
and
french
to
surround
boer
forces
that
were
retiring
sullenly
from
their
futile
siege
of
wepener
but
de
wet
was
in
command
there
and
his
mobile
aided
by
secret
information
from
free
state
burghers
who
having
taken
the
oath
of
neutrality
were
allowed
to
live
on
their
farms
or
to
move
about
freely
without
any
watch
being
kept
on
them
frustrated
every
attempt
to
hem
in
the
commandos
general
colonial
division
following
sir
leslie
was
still
some
distance
off
and
general
retirement
to
bloemfontein
for
fresh
orders
at
this
juncture
unfortunately
left
a
gap
open
between
general
left
and
the
force
under
sir
ian
hamilton
which
was
by
that
time
extended
along
the
modder
valley
near
post
facing
through
this
opening
the
boers
slipped
back
to
the
high
ground
round
about
thaba
pressed
hard
by
french
they
were
driven
from
the
southern
and
western
spurs
of
these
hills
but
still
clung
to
the
commanding
mountain
itself
where
they
gathered
reinforcements
day
by
day
then
french
ceased
to
press
and
the
turn
came
for
ian
hamilton
to
strike
in
the
hope
that
he
might
drive
a
wedge
across
the
lower
ridges
between
thaba
and
brandfort
which
would
not
only
tear
the
chain
of
boer
positions
asunder
but
also
open
the
way
for
a
combined
movement
by
which
their
left
wing
under
de
wet
should
be
enveloped
if
he
attempted
to
prolong
his
stand
in
the
thaba
range
it
was
cleverly
designed
but
we
all
know
what
often
happens
with
the
plans
especially
when
there
are
spies
free
to
move
about
without
danger
to
themselves
it
was
at
this
phase
of
the
extended
operations
that
sir
ian
hamilton
began
to
advance
towards
houtnek
where
he
found
himself
confronted
by
a
formidable
gathering
of
commandos
under
general
louis
botha
and
they
were
being
reinforced
from
all
directions
the
boers
having
regained
hope
and
courage
from
the
presence
of
a
leader
whose
reputation
then
stood
incomparably
high
among
them
though
the
numerical
strength
and
boldness
of
his
enemies
were
something
of
a
surprise
to
general
hamilton
he
had
in
some
measure
prepared
for
the
unforeseen
by
calling
upon
general
tucker
to
make
a
diversion
by
which
the
boers
under
de
la
command
in
brandfort
might
be
discouraged
from
sending
reinforcements
to
houtnek
with
the
seventh
division
or
rather
in
advance
of
it
as
a
covering
screen
the
mounted
infantry
brigade
under
colonel
henry
was
ordered
to
supported
by
general
brigade
of
infantry
of
the
mounted
infantry
to
which
a
post
of
honour
was
thus
assigned
the
battalion
commanded
by
colonel
ross
was
to
form
the
advance
guard
thus
horse
were
destined
in
their
first
fight
to
bear
the
brunt
of
the
attack
if
it
should
come
and
in
high
spirits
at
the
prospect
they
looked
with
an
interest
they
had
never
felt
before
towards
the
rugged
line
of
low
kopjes
far
away
across
the
broad
plain
with
light
from
the
setting
sun
full
upon
them
that
the
orders
were
thus
made
known
to
all
ranks
twelve
hours
before
they
could
be
acted
on
is
a
proof
that
they
had
not
been
drawn
up
on
the
spur
of
sudden
emergency
and
indeed
sir
ian
hamilton
was
only
then
feeling
for
his
enemy
in
the
direction
of
houtnek
at
this
point
the
picturesque
pen
of
the
correspondent
goes
on
with
the
narrative
on
april
we
got
warning
to
be
ready
to
take
part
in
a
general
attack
early
the
next
morning
so
we
bustled
round
and
got
everything
ready
at
i
and
two
other
men
of
my
were
ordered
out
on
outlying
picket
leaving
trooper
thelwall
to
saddle
our
three
horses
before
daybreak
as
well
as
his
own
when
we
were
to
march
into
camp
again
and
get
mounted
and
ready
to
start
with
the
rest
so
just
having
time
to
get
half
a
pint
of
tea
and
some
dry
bread
we
hurried
out
on
picket
for
the
night
and
that
was
practically
speaking
the
last
food
i
tasted
until
the
next
night
not
what
you
could
call
is
it
it
was
bitterly
cold
and
what
with
the
everlasting
night
wind
and
only
one
blanket
we
pickets
were
not
much
troubled
with
sleep
that
night
however
at
in
the
morning
of
the
we
rolled
up
our
blankets
and
marched
into
camp
and
at
once
set
to
work
at
tightening
up
girths
adjusting
saddles
and
kits
i
had
just
time
to
put
some
bread
into
my
haversack
and
half
fill
my
nosebag
with
cartridges
and
also
two
or
three
priceless
when
we
had
to
mount
so
away
went
all
chances
of
breakfast
that
morning
alas
some
of
us
had
no
need
for
food
and
drink
in
the
evening
just
as
old
sol
began
to
rise
up
over
the
kopjes
we
marched
out
of
camp
up
over
the
ridge
and
down
the
other
side
towards
the
open
veldt
here
we
paused
for
a
while
to
allow
the
other
troops
to
join
us
taking
advantage
of
this
short
halt
we
got
into
our
proper
dismounted
and
had
a
last
look
at
our
girths
and
tightened
up
curbs
poor
old
mokes
how
many
of
them
my
own
included
were
fated
never
to
see
another
day
dawn
colonel
lumsden
now
rode
up
to
us
and
gave
us
a
rough
idea
of
what
we
were
to
do
and
informed
us
that
our
b
troop
was
to
have
the
place
of
honour
and
that
we
were
to
take
the
lead
and
knowing
us
as
he
did
he
had
not
the
slightest
doubt
that
we
would
not
fail
to
distinguish
ourselves
to
which
our
gallant
captain
chamney
began
to
reply
in
his
usual
indian
style
that
he
felt
proud
of
his
troop
and
fully
conscious
of
the
great
honour
that
was
bestowed
upon
us
in
being
allowed
to
take
the
lead
and
he
sincerely
hoped
that
we
would
do
justice
to
the
confidence
bestowed
on
us
he
would
no
doubt
have
continued
in
this
style
for
some
time
had
not
our
good
old
major
chipped
in
with
his
usual
aside
all
right
chamney
damn
it
man
of
course
you
and
these
were
the
last
words
i
ever
heard
the
good
old
man
utter
in
this
life
illustration
captain
chamney
good
old
showers
gruff
as
they
make
but
a
true
white
heart
inside
for
all
that
never
afraid
to
jump
on
an
officer
for
all
you
were
worth
if
you
thought
he
deserved
it
and
after
those
long
hot
indian
parades
how
many
times
have
we
heard
your
hearty
laugh
at
the
head
of
the
camp
for
seven
years
our
colonel
and
the
man
who
made
the
surma
valley
light
horse
second
to
none
in
india
all
the
attacking
forces
being
now
mustered
we
made
a
start
and
away
we
marched
for
some
part
of
the
time
our
route
lay
alongside
a
pretty
little
lagoon
and
then
the
road
gradually
lost
itself
in
the
great
open
veldt
how
peaceful
it
all
seemed
that
morning
the
few
cattle
and
sheep
that
were
quietly
grazing
here
and
there
on
the
scanty
tussocks
would
casually
lift
up
their
heads
and
gaze
at
us
and
seeing
that
there
were
no
strange
dogs
with
us
would
go
on
cropping
the
grass
though
possibly
a
sheep
or
two
would
scuttle
out
of
the
way
with
a
contemptuous
wriggle
of
their
tails
time
of
war
one
one
could
not
believe
it
on
that
quiet
morning
the
fresh
ozonised
air
the
soft
steady
breeze
now
pleasantly
tempered
by
the
bright
morning
sun
and
there
by
the
doorway
of
the
quiet
little
farmhouse
the
wife
standing
with
her
all
ready
while
she
laughingly
makes
passing
remarks
to
her
departing
the
only
signs
of
war
maybe
are
those
few
fences
with
their
wires
cut
down
and
these
you
would
suppose
had
been
broken
down
by
some
restless
calves
or
foal
from
our
ranks
could
be
seen
and
smelt
the
little
clouds
of
which
rose
up
in
the
clear
air
like
so
many
stray
wandering
bits
of
cumulus
clouds
while
back
in
the
rear
could
be
heard
the
quaintly
sad
airs
of
ganga
and
dat
as
some
of
our
musically
inclined
troopers
gave
vent
unconsciously
to
their
feelings
what
a
lovely
jolly
morning
that
was
all
those
dire
hardships
cold
hunger
and
wet
we
had
known
only
too
well
but
warmth
and
the
indescribable
freshness
of
the
open
veldt
while
under
us
were
our
plucky
indians
arabs
and
walers
fresh
as
english
daisies
and
keen
as
the
air
we
breathed
some
miles
ahead
of
seemingly
quite
close
owing
to
the
intensely
clear
a
long
range
of
hills
all
lighted
up
with
various
shades
of
colouring
the
hues
of
which
kept
ever
changing
from
moment
to
moment
as
the
sun
rose
higher
in
the
heavens
still
further
on
and
filling
up
the
whole
background
of
this
typically
african
landscape
lay
the
and
peaks
of
the
basuto
hills
from
the
tops
of
which
soft
filmy
wisps
of
cloud
drifted
silently
away
into
that
great
blue
all
peace
peace
on
earth
it
seemed
to
us
that
fair
morn
nor
could
we
poor
troopers
realise
that
ere
sun
should
set
that
night
great
mars
would
look
down
on
many
of
us
poor
mortals
writhing
in
the
agonies
of
cruel
wounds
and
the
tortures
of
the
knife
and
probe
while
some
poor
souls
like
these
vanishing
vapoury
clouds
would
have
left
this
little
world
for
the
infinite
beyond
nor
could
the
mind
of
our
major
as
he
rode
at
the
head
of
those
men
he
had
known
for
long
long
years
have
realised
that
in
a
few
short
hours
his
true
british
heart
would
have
ceased
to
beat
and
his
blood
would
be
mingled
with
the
dust
of
that
great
continent
where
so
many
good
men
and
true
had
already
given
up
their
lives
for
an
cause
thank
god
for
the
impenetrable
veil
that
he
casts
over
our
future
one
scene
especially
struck
me
by
its
beauty
and
that
was
when
a
battery
of
artillery
toiled
over
a
tussocky
ridge
right
into
the
blazing
disc
of
the
sun
as
gun
after
gun
topped
the
ridge
the
whole
team
horses
and
men
were
shut
out
from
our
sight
by
the
powerful
blaze
of
light
in
a
most
curious
way
while
here
and
there
a
helmeted
artilleryman
stood
silhouetted
against
the
over
which
the
khaki
disappeared
into
a
glaring
sea
of
gold
as
we
were
now
approaching
some
kopjes
we
opened
out
into
extended
order
as
usual
and
horse
were
told
off
to
take
and
a
certain
line
of
kopjes
some
two
miles
off
so
we
promptly
set
to
work
approaching
them
very
with
scouts
well
out
in
advance
arriving
at
the
base
of
the
kopjes
without
opposition
we
dismounted
and
skirmished
up
to
the
tops
but
found
that
the
boers
had
cleared
out
though
judging
by
the
several
built
of
rocks
these
must
have
been
held
in
force
our
scouts
in
the
meantime
had
advanced
along
the
plain
on
the
other
side
of
the
kopjes
and
just
as
we
arrived
on
top
the
enemy
opened
on
them
with
a
continuous
rattle
of
rifle
fire
and
i
saw
several
of
the
poor
beggars
limping
back
over
the
plain
pulling
their
wounded
horses
after
them
while
all
around
them
to
use
language
the
sandy
plain
kept
as
the
deadly
bullets
struck
and
ricocheted
from
where
we
were
it
was
utterly
impossible
to
tell
from
what
direction
the
bullets
were
coming
so
we
could
do
little
in
the
way
of
keeping
down
the
boer
fire
however
we
did
our
best
but
as
the
enemy
soon
ceased
firing
we
reserved
our
ammunition
for
later
use
away
to
our
left
the
artillery
were
now
having
a
great
duel
while
the
on
both
sides
were
making
things
generally
cruel
for
the
mounted
infantry
and
also
for
those
who
were
holding
their
horses
and
immediately
whack
whack
whack
would
echo
the
vile
bursting
shells
then
came
the
big
hidden
oh
the
sound
of
its
messenger
it
would
come
soaring
up
with
a
dreadfully
mournful
sound
while
the
whole
atmosphere
seemed
to
vibrate
with
its
spinning
wugh
it
would
sound
as
it
burst
far
out
of
way
and
then
one
could
stand
up
in
the
afraid
style
to
lie
down
again
promptly
as
no
came
along
how
did
i
feel
you
ask
well
to
be
strictly
honest
i
like
it
i
believe
any
man
really
does
if
it
comes
to
that
afterwards
a
wounded
man
described
his
feelings
very
well
to
me
he
said
you
know
i
just
felt
as
if
i
were
outside
the
room
in
for
a
dashed
good
and
i
think
that
hits
off
the
sensation
exactly
but
now
the
picturesquely
vague
must
give
place
to
the
explicit
and
it
would
be
impossible
to
summarise
the
position
at
this
stage
more
clearly
than
in
the
terse
words
of
colonel
official
despatch
on
the
evening
of
the
colonel
ross
received
orders
that
the
corps
was
to
make
a
demonstration
next
morning
at
daylight
on
the
right
flank
of
the
boer
lines
for
the
purpose
of
drawing
them
from
their
position
and
enabling
the
brigade
under
general
maxwell
which
was
to
have
come
up
on
our
right
to
get
behind
and
cut
them
off
the
mounted
infantry
portion
of
general
division
under
colonel
henry
joined
hands
with
us
at
half
a
mile
from
our
camp
a
portion
of
my
corps
was
ordered
to
occupy
gun
kopje
a
position
believed
to
be
held
by
the
boers
about
four
miles
distant
on
our
right
front
the
remainder
extending
and
taking
up
positions
on
our
left
i
went
forward
with
the
right
flank
major
showers
accompanying
me
this
portion
consisted
of
the
adjutant
captain
taylor
captains
rutherfoord
clifford
and
chamney
lieutenants
sidey
and
pugh
and
four
sections
the
others
having
been
detached
by
order
of
colonel
ross
to
hold
various
points
pugh
was
sent
out
in
advance
with
the
scouts
and
it
was
when
on
this
duty
that
private
franks
was
shot
pugh
very
pluckily
assisted
him
in
getting
on
his
horse
and
endeavoured
to
take
him
out
of
the
fire
but
franks
was
unable
to
stay
on
his
horse
and
dropping
to
the
ground
had
to
be
left
pugh
and
the
remaining
scouts
were
only
just
able
to
save
themselves
by
galloping
up
and
joining
us
on
the
kopje
at
the
extreme
right
to
which
we
had
just
advanced
and
which
we
held
from
until
ordered
to
retire
at
about
early
in
the
morning
i
ordered
corporal
chartres
with
eight
men
to
occupy
a
kopje
about
yards
to
our
right
and
prevent
the
boers
turning
our
flank
there
they
held
their
ground
until
ordered
to
fall
back
it
was
a
small
party
for
this
important
position
but
in
the
circumstances
no
more
could
be
spared
i
having
only
about
sixty
men
with
me
twenty
of
whom
under
lieutenant
sidey
were
detached
by
colonel
ross
to
protect
the
commonly
styled
in
the
centre
of
the
position
the
following
was
then
the
general
disposition
there
were
four
ridges
diverging
northerly
towards
the
enemy
the
extreme
spur
of
the
right
ridge
was
held
by
myself
with
four
sections
horse
as
described
the
second
held
by
lieutenant
crane
and
one
section
he
being
directed
there
at
the
outset
by
colonel
ross
the
third
and
fourth
by
the
rest
of
the
brigade
the
two
and
our
maxim
being
at
the
head
of
the
between
the
second
and
third
ridges
with
captain
noblett
and
three
sections
on
its
left
shortly
after
our
arrival
the
boers
took
up
a
position
on
a
kopje
about
yards
directly
in
front
and
quickly
opened
rifle
fire
on
our
position
fortunately
the
men
had
time
to
ensconce
themselves
behind
rocks
and
consequently
though
bullets
fell
fast
about
them
they
were
able
to
maintain
a
steady
fire
on
the
enemy
without
exposing
themselves
it
was
here
i
deeply
regret
to
say
that
major
showers
met
his
death
he
was
at
the
extreme
right
of
the
firing
line
and
under
a
hot
flanking
fire
from
the
boers
who
had
moved
a
party
into
a
donga
some
or
yards
to
their
left
illustration
captain
neville
taylor
i
personally
begged
him
not
to
expose
himself
as
also
did
captains
chamney
and
rutherfoord
but
he
would
stand
erect
using
his
field
glasses
and
presenting
a
most
conspicuous
mark
for
the
fire
which
resulted
fatally
to
him
shortly
after
noon
a
mauser
bullet
entering
his
right
side
half
way
down
and
coming
out
through
his
left
arm
above
the
elbow
in
risking
his
own
life
he
had
drawn
a
heavy
fire
on
the
spot
where
he
fell
and
it
was
with
much
danger
and
difficulty
that
captain
powell
with
captain
chamney
and
others
succeeded
in
removing
him
from
the
summit
of
the
hill
to
a
place
of
safety
about
thirty
yards
down
i
should
like
to
take
this
opportunity
of
adding
a
few
words
by
way
of
tribute
to
the
memory
of
major
showers
when
he
heard
of
the
corps
being
raised
he
was
in
command
of
the
surma
valley
light
horse
in
cachar
with
the
rank
of
colonel
and
was
looked
upon
as
one
of
the
smartest
commanders
of
volunteer
cavalry
in
india
he
wrote
me
and
said
you
will
take
me
as
your
second
in
command
i
will
gladly
forfeit
my
rank
and
come
as
i
may
have
made
many
fortunate
selections
in
choosing
my
officers
but
i
never
made
a
wiser
one
than
in
selecting
colonel
showers
a
better
or
a
braver
man
never
breathed
and
his
loss
to
me
so
early
in
the
campaign
was
irreparable
shortly
after
the
commencement
of
the
boer
attack
the
whole
of
the
left
were
forced
to
retire
owing
to
their
flank
being
turned
taking
one
and
our
maxim
with
them
captain
noblett
was
consequently
obliged
at
about
to
conform
to
this
movement
having
no
support
and
took
his
men
out
of
the
shell
fire
with
great
difficulty
but
had
only
a
few
casualties
lieutenant
crane
receiving
no
orders
to
retire
and
being
detached
from
me
and
unable
to
communicate
with
me
or
i
with
him
deemed
it
his
duty
to
retain
his
position
as
long
as
possible
which
resulted
in
close
fighting
and
the
loss
of
nearly
half
his
section

until

retired
at
about
and
at

and
i
both
received
our
orders
to
retire
this
was
carried
out
very
deliberately
and
the
last
of
our
men
got
out
of
a
most
trying
position
within
twenty
minutes
of
having
received
our
orders
by
moving
away
under
cover
of
the
ridge
as
we
had
kept
up
a
decreasing
fire
until
the
men
got
mounted
the
boers
fortunately
for
us
did
not
discover
our
retirement
before

were
out

we
should
have
suffered
heavily

remained
with

saw
the
last
of

mounted
and
clear
away
before
he
himself
left
bringing
up
the
rear
with
captain
clifford
and
some
late
stragglers
including
one
man
who
would
stay
for
a
last
shot
the
whole
brigade
rendezvoused
at
behind
a
kopje
about
three
miles
in
rear
and
waited
till
when
we
returned
to
our
various
camps
for
some
reason
the
main
attack
on
our
right
under
general
maxwell
had
not
been
delivered
and
the
object
of
the
day
was
not
achieved
my
corps
alone
had
the
regrettable
number
of
eighteen
casualties
out
of
about
engaged
this
was
mainly
accounted
for
by
the
position
we
held
the
maxim
under
captain
holmes
did
good
service
coming
into
action
at
yards
at
a
critical
moment
and
checking
the
boer
advance
for
some
time
the
tom
however
soon
found
the
maxim
out
and
as
the
shells
were
bursting
among
the
men
with
the
gun
horses
they
were
ordered
to
retire
only
just
in
time
all
the
team
being
more
or
less
wounded
i
can
not
speak
too
highly
of
the
gallant
behaviour
of
my
officers
and
men
throughout
the
day
individual
instances
of
heroism
were
numerous
and
i
much
fear
that
especially
in
section
many
of
the
casualties
were
caused
by
men
endeavouring
to
assist
their
wounded
comrades
crane
himself
was
wounded
in
the
groin
and
i
understand
private
and
private
deaths
were
due
to
their
declining
to
leave
their
wounded
officer
judging
from
the
number
of
empty
cartridge
cases
found
beside
them
they
must
have
kept
up
a
fire
on
the
advancing
boers
to
the
last
here
corporal

the

evening
about

private
godden
went
out
under
the
red
cross
flag
to
search
for
the
wounded
but
in
the
gathering
darkness
were
only
able
to
reach
the
body
of
major
showers
who
died
previous
to
the
retirement
from
our
position
on
the
right
where
he
fell
captain
powell
in
endeavouring
to
return
to
camp
lost
his
way
and
had
to
remain
during
the
night
on
the
veldt
reaching
camp
soon
after
daylight
next
morning
shortly
after
his
arrival
he
returned
with
another
search
party
but
found
that
the
boers
had
already
buried
the
bodies
of
privates
case
daubney
and
lumsden
after
having
read
the
burial
service
over
them
a
stone
had
been
put
over
the
head
of
private
lumsden
with
his
name
scratched
on
it
the
reason
for
this
as
narrated
by
stephens
is
interesting
when
drivers
were
sent
out
with
carts
the
following
day
they
met
several
boers
would
not
talk
much
about
the
fight
but
said
they
were
sorry
our
colonel
was
killed
they
had
found
some
papers
in
the
pockets
of
young
lumsden
whom
they
took
to
be
the
the
remains
of
major
showers
being
found
still
unburied
were
brought
back
and
interred
with
military
honours
at
the
foot
of
the
kopje
behind
our
camp
private
franks
whose
wounds
had
been
dressed
by
captain
powell
had
to
be
left
on
the
hill
near
the
body
of
major
showers
where
he
was
found
by
the
boers
shortly
afterwards
and
received
every
attention
but
died
during
the
night
and
was
buried
by
them
in
the
morning
the
boers
subsequent
to
the
fight
were
most
courteous
in
their
attentions
and
returned
papers
rings
watches
money
found
on
the
bodies
i
wish
specially
to
mention
a
very
plucky
action
done
by
private
walton
who
is
wounded
and
a
prisoner
in
pretoria
he
was
one
of
the
men
in
charge
of
the
led
horses
in
the
no
section
of
a
company
when
sergeant
walker
took
temporary
command
of
the
section
in
lieutenant
absence
on
sick
leave
on
the
order
to
retire
sergeant
walker
had
to
run
some
distance
to
his
horse
and
came
back
much
exhausted
the
enemy
being
quite
close
on
them
and
sergeant
horse
having
been
lost
private
walton
insisted
on
giving
up
his
own
horse
to
the
sergeant
saying
that
he
could
run
while
doing
so
he
was
shot
twice
and
had
to
be
left
on
the
ground
although
sergeant
walker
did
his
utmost
to
take
him
along
with
him
after
our
return
to
camp
i
was
much
gratified
to
receive
from
colonel
ross
the
corps
commander
and
colonel
henry
the
brigade
commander
congratulations
on
the
behaviour
of
my
officers
and
men
throughout
the
day
and
on
the
morning
following
general
tucker
the
divisional
commander
came
over
in
person
for
a
similar
purpose
but
at
the
same
time
read
me
a
lecture
on
the
inadvisability
of
allowing
my
men
to
attempt
to
bring
off
their
wounded
comrades
when
under
fire
he
pointed
out
that
it
only
drew
fire
on
the
wounded
men
and
endangered
their
own
lives
for
no
adequate
result
as
the
boers
were
a
very
humane
foe
who
treated
the
wounded
carefully
the
troopers
he
said
must
remember
that
their
first
duty
as
soldiers
was
to
their
queen

courage
and
in

wounded
comrades
might
have
endangered
the
lives
of
others
we
may
be
sure
that
he
made
a
mental
reservation
and
wished
in
his
heart
that
he
might
have
regiments
of
such
men
to
lead
if
the

obeying

caution
as
by
brilliant
leadership

by

valour
that
was
almost
reckless
in
its
disregard
of
personal
danger
but
he
knew
with
the
intuition
of
a
quick
sympathies
that
the
corps
to
whose
colonel
his
words
were
addressed
wanted
no
incentive
to
boldness
but
rather
a
lesson

he
had
seen
a
great
deal
of
their
gallantry
in
that
action
for
himself
and
his
brigadiers

demanded
let
him
read
the
narrative
of
their
actions
as
told
by
themselves
or
their
comrades
and
be
answered
in
the
whole
literature
of
war
i
know
nothing
more
realistic
than
trooper
description
of
the
incident
in
which
he
was
a
participator
when
lying
wounded
he
was
taken
from
under
fire
by
captain
chamney
and
finally
carried
out
of
action
on
horseback
in
that
arms
the
story
is
too
characteristic
of
the
battlefield
to
bear
mutilation
for
the
sake
of
space
though
with
reluctance
some
picturesque
passages
must
be
sacrificed
but
for
the
rest
as
trooper
told
it
originally
in
his
letters
to
the
he
shall
tell
it
again
here
the
kopje
which
we
had
to
hold
looked
down
on
a
sloping
plain
and
at
a
distance
varying
from
to
yards
off
and
running
nearly
parallel
with
our
kopjes
was
a
deep
dry
river
bed
or
donga
this
donga
ran
right
up
towards
the
boer
position
in
my
humble
opinion
we
should
have
done
better
to
have
placed
some
dismounted
men
in
this
donga
and
so
prevented
the
enemy
using
it
as
a
zigzag
trench
or
covered
way
towards
our
position
instead
of
this
we
literally
stuck
to
the
kopje
and
in
the
early
part
of
the
fight
i
noticed
and
drew
my
attention
to
the
fact
that
a
lot
of
boers
were
riding
towards
this
river
bed
but
never
seemed
to
cross
it
as
the
day
wore
on
our
position
on
these
kopjes
became
somewhat
too
warm
to
be
pleasant
and
judging
by
the
whistle
of
the
bullets
we
seemed
to
have
the
enemy
on
our
left
flank
as
well
as
in
front
it
was
about
this
time
that
our
gallant
major
who
scorned
to
take
cover
got
two
mortal
bullet
wounds
through
his
lungs
our
doctor
very
pluckily
set
to
and
cut
off
his
tunic
and
plugged
the
quite
regardless
of
the
heavy
fire
he
was
subjected
to
but
it
was
of
no
use
in
a
few
moments
the
brave
old
soldier
breathed
his
last
all
he
said
was
well
done
for
not
so
bad
as
i
should
have
but
there
was
no
time
now
to
think
of
him
or
any
other
poor
wounded
comrade
on
we
went
blazing
away
for
dear
life
at
the
enemy
flat
on
our
empty
stomachs
wriggling
from
one
stone
to
another
never
daring
to
raise
head
above
a
few
inches
from
the
ground
whish
whish
phew
phew
came
those
deadly
nickels
then
would
sound
the
ricocheting
shots
as
they
struck
the
stones
and
rocks
a
few
inches
from
our
faces
and
shot
up
into
the
clear
blue
sky
behind
us
with
a
shriek
of
unquenched
bloodthirstiness
thicker
and
thicker
they
now
we
saw
that
the
enemy
were
straight
in
front
of
us
having
as
i
had
expected
ridden
up
under
the
cover
of
the
river
bed
orders
now
came
for
us
to
retreat
slowly
from
the
right
so
as
soon
as
my
turn
came
i
let
blaze
a
few
rapid
parting
shots
and
then
back
over
the
ridge
to
where
trooper
ducat
was
holding
my
horses
i
can
tell
you
that
was
an
exciting
little
bit
of
a
sprint
and
the
bullets
striking
all
around
me
did
not
tend
to
retard
my
movements
however
i
got
back
all
right
and
a
few
seconds
later
trooper
stevenson
turned
up
as
trooper
thelwall
had
not
joined
us
i
waited
a
few
minutes
with
his
horse
and
rather
an
anxious
wait
that
was
as
he
did
not
however
arrive
i
presumed
that
some
boer
bullet
had
found
him
out
but
i
tied
his
horse
to
a
stump
in
case
he
did
come
and
then
mounting
i
galloped
after
the
rest
it
was
uncommonly
lucky
that
i
did
tie
up
his
horse
as
he
afterwards
during
a
slight
lull
in
the
firing
managed
to
make
a
bolt
over
the
kopje
and
down
to
his
horse
one
often
hears
it
said
that
mounted
infantry
do
not
need
to
be
much
of
riders
so
long
as
they
can
shoot
straight
all
i
can
say
is
let
a
bad
rider
try
to
mount
a
fresh
horse
with
a
large
kit
on
the
saddle
and
a
heavy
rifle
in
his
left
hand
and
bullets
and
shells
whistling
and
cracking
around
and
he
will
agree
with
me
in
saying
that
every
mounted
infantryman
ought
to
be
a
very
fair
rider
before
he
can
be
of
much
use
in
a
fight
gathering
up
my
reins
i
kept
up
a
good
gallop
towards
our
next
kopje
and
was
just
congratulating
myself
that
i
was
too
skinny
a
target
for
any
boer
bullets
when
poor
old
demon
came
down
with
a
fearful
crash
shot
by
a
mauser
bullet
i
suppose
i
must
have
been
stunned
by
the
fall
as
i
have
no
recollection
of
seeing
him
again
when
i
came
to
i
found
that
my
neck
was
fearfully
stiff
and
sore
likewise
all
the
left
side
of
my
head
and
jove
pain
was
no
word
for
it
i
lay
there
cursing
and
crawling
about
for
some
time
and
was
momentarily
expecting
to
have
a
into
me
when
bang
and
i
remembered
no
more
i
have
since
heard
that
after
this
two
of
our
chaps
came
along
and
dismounting
turned
me
over
and
left
me
as
a
i
remember
dimly
wondering
what
time
of
day
it
was
as
all
things
seemingly
were
so
dim
and
dark
that
i
could
not
see
i
then
thought
of
tying
up
my
head
with
my
field
dressing
but
whether
i
did
so
or
not
i
could
not
swear
as
i
was
more
or
less
it
must
have
been
a
or
some
other
kind
of
shell
bursting
near
me
that
did
the
damage
recovering
a
certain
amount
of
sensibility
i
was
endeavouring
to
get
under
some
cover
when
captain
chamney
rode
up
he
shouted
out
to
me
apparently
from
a
long
distance
off
as
i
could
just
hear
him
what
the
tivil
are
you
doing
here
badly
hurt
are
ye
come
on
then
get
a
hold
of
my
stirrup
take
ye
along
me
far
and
away
too
good
a
man
to
leave
i
told
him
of
course
to
go
on
as
i
was
all
right
and
would
get
behind
a
rock
and
have
a
rest
but
the
good
old
told
me
to
get
up
at
once
as
he
ordered
and
a
good
job
it
was
too
he
did
me
to
do
so
or
have
been
resting
there
now
just
then
trooper
ducat
came
galloping
up
and
the
two
of
them
got
me
between
them
and
trotted
me
along
some
hundreds
of
seemed
miles
to
me
at
last
i
got
nearly
unconscious
merely
rolling
along
in
a
sort
of
mechanical
style
but
try
as
much
as
i
could
what
with
loss
of
blood
and
giddiness
i
could
go
no
further
and
as
i
was
a
mere
dead
weight
on
my
two
companions
they
halted
and
i
next
remember
myself
sitting
behind
captain
chamney
with
my
blood
sopping
down
his
neck
and
khaki
tunic
my
head
resting
on
his
shoulder
and
my
hands
locked
round
his
body
how
i
got
there
i
know
i
suppose
they
lifted
me
up
somehow
anyhow
there
i
was
and
the
good
old
commandeered
free
stater
carried
us
well
i
remember
much
of
that
ride
somebody
else
rode
up
alongside
of
think
it
was
trooper
he
being
scotch
and
therefore
had
pluckily
picked
up
my
rifle
so
with
ducat
on
one
side
and
stevenson
on
the
other
alternately
digging
me
in
the
ribs
i
managed
to
hold
on
until
we
got
to
cover
and
here
ducat
who
luckily
for
me
was
a
doctor
bound
me
up
and
gave
me
a
drink
gad
i
was
thirsty
shortly
afterwards
one
of
nepaulese
ambulance
tongas
which
we
had
brought
over
from
india
with
us
galloped
up
and
i
was
put
inside
i
think
that
worthy
ghoorka
driver
liked
the
sound
of
mausers
any
better
than
i
did
for
he
simply
galloped
the
whole
way
over
stones
over
scrub
over
ruts
i
shall
never
forget
that
ride
however
i
got
to
the
camp
all
right
and
willing
hands
carried
me
to
my
tent
where
i
lay
till
dark
with
only
a
greatcoat
for
a
pillow
and
a
good
solid
piece
of
natural
veldt
for
a
bed
towards
evening
ducat
came
in
and
with
great
kindness
went
and
made
me
some
cornflour
which
i
was
able
to
eat
this
was
the
first
food
i
had
had
barring
three
or
four
mouthfuls
of
stale
bread
since
the
night
before
powell
came
back
from
the
fight
later
he
had
been
tending
the
wounded
and
dying
there
tired
and
weary
as
he
was
he
at
once
set
to
and
tied
my
head
up
first
shaving
off
some
of
my
hair
i
remember
much
after
this
i
remember
sergeant
elliott
of
edinburgh
was
brought
into
the
tent
with
his
foot
shattered
by
a
and
we
groaned
out
a
duet
throughout
that
night
in
the
fight
elliott
was
holding
some
horses
when
a
shell
burst
in
their
midst
shattering
foot
and
finishing
off
several
horses
including
his
own
managing
to
get
hold
of
another
mount
he
rode
up
and
reported
himself
to
captain
noblett
by
whom
he
was
of
course
ordered
to
the
rear
so
badly
wounded
as
he
was
elliott
rode
those
five
miles
back
to
camp
unaided
next
day
or
the
day
do
not
remember
exactly
as
i
was
unconscious
for
two
or
three
days
off
and
ambulance
waggons
drove
up
and
into
them
we
were
shoved
colonel
lumsden
captain
noblett
captain
chamney
and
sergeant
hewitt
i
think
all
were
there
seeing
us
off
and
helping
us
to
our
peckers
my
one
complaint
was
that
captain
chamney
wanted
to
shave
off
my
moustache
when
he
was
doing
the
trick
on
the
veldt
i
asked
him
why
he
wanted
to
he
was
much
surprised
at
the
question
and
told
me
in
answer
that
were
too
many
boers
doing
the
shaving
for
him
to
think
of
it
i
must
have
imagined
the
whole
thing
i
suppose
when
i
was
lying
illustration
herbert
betts
another
incident
which
was
referred
to
briefly
by
colonel
lumsden
who
for
obvious
reasons
did
not
make
much
of
it
is
thus
described
in
detail
by
trooper
preston
horse
was
to
do
the
work
of
advance
guard
and
scouts
no
section
b
company
was
chosen
for
the
scouting
and
immediately
sent
out
and
very
soon
the
whole
of
the
mounted
infantry
was
spread
over
the
plain
one
troopers
franks
were
powis
and
myself
were
scouting
ahead
of
everyone
else
for
the
first
three
or
four
miles
the
ground
was
fairly
level
with
a
few
small
kopjes
with
trees
on
them
then
there
was
a
ridge
of
kopjes
with
a
steep
valley
behind
and
then
another
ridge
the
scouts
got
to
the
first
ridge
of
kopjes
before
seeing
anyone
then
two
shots
were
heard
in
the
distance
and
a
man
on
a
big
roan
horse
was
seen
galloping
away
as
the
scouts
rode
between
two
kopjes
on
the
first
ridge
about
sixteen
men
were
seen
to
come
out
from
the
top
of
the
ridge
immediately
the
scouts
halted
looked
at
them
through
their
and
saw
they
were
dressed
in
khaki
before
the
scouts
started
they
had
been
told
to
look
out
for
some
of
general
men
on
their
right
one
of
the
officers
coming
up
then
lieutenant
pugh
looked
at
them
and
saw
the
same
as
the
they
were
dressed
in
khaki
the
scouts
then
rode
round
the
kopje
intending
to
meet
them
by
this
time
the
sixteen
men
had
got
down
into
the
valley
and
were
making
up
the
steep
hill
on
the
other
side
to
the
top
of
the
kopje
trooper
franks
and
i
then
went
down
the
valley
intending
to
see
who
they
were
while
the
other
two
went
on
to
the
right
the
men
had
by
this
time
got
on
to
the
some
dismounting
and
others
sitting
still
we
rode
half
way
down
the
valley
which
was
about
two
hundred
yards
across
and
then
halted
and
looked
through
our
glasses
the
men
on
the
top
then
shouted
out
something
and
began
to
fire
at
us
so
we
turned
and
galloped
for
our
lives
trooper
franks
after
riding
about
three
hundred
yards
began
reeling
in
his
saddle
and
tumbled
off
lieutenant
pugh
and
a
few
men
then
galloped
up
to
him
and
found
he
was
shot
through
the
back
and
stomach
the
bullets
meanwhile
were
raining
about
them
franks
begged
us
to
leave
him
saying
that
as
soon
as
we
were
gone
the
boers
would
stop
firing
so
lieutenant
pugh
gave
the
order
to
leave
him
and
return
to
the
others
who
by
this
time
were
lining
the
ridge
behind
horse
having
the
highest
kopje
to
hold
as
soon
as
our
colonel
heard
franks
was
wounded
he
started
off
on
foot
with
troopers
betts
percy
smith
and
chapman
to
fetch
him
the
boers
immediately
advanced
down
their
side
of
the
valley
and
began
firing
at
the
colonel
and
his
party
however
they
were
prepared
for
this
and
after
a
few
shots
the
boers
retired
the
colonel
bringing
franks
in
on
his
own
horse
and
walking
beside
then
we
got
the
word
passed
to
retire
from
the
right
perfect
order
was
maintained
the
men
retiring
one
by
one
the
others
keeping
up
a
continuous
fire
until
their
turn
came
at
last
everyone
had
got
away
except
lieutenant
crane
and
three
or
four
more
whom
the
order
to
retire
never
reached
the
colonel
and
adjutant
were
among
the
last
to
go
away
the
behaviour
of
the
men
was
just
as
if
they
had
been
accustomed
to
that
kind
of
thing
all
their
lives
smoking
and
firing
at
the
same
time
others
lying
behind
rocks
and
writing
letters
to
their
relations
and
sweethearts
the
boers
did
not
follow
us
up
and
we
reached
camp
safely
but
very
sad
for
the
losses
we
had
sustained
another
version
of
these
incidents
with
such
minor
differences
as
help
to
give
a
clear
conception
of
the
whole
scene
is
furnished
by
the
special
correspondent
of
the
daily
news
who
after
describing
the
lucky
escape
of
one
scout
writes
trooper
franks
of
the
same
the
very
best
of
fellows
and
liked
by
everyone
was
not
so
lucky
poor
fellow
he
accompanied
lieutenant
pugh
in
advance
but
seeing
nothing
franks
suggested
that
he
should
go
forward
to
the
top
of
the
donga
or
nullah
in
which
they
were
standing
but
on
reaching
the
top
he
was
confronted
by
thirty
or
forty
of
the
enemy
about
three
hundred
yards
away
they
beckoned
to
him
and
spoke
to
him
in
dutch
presumably
inquiring
who
he
was
without
waiting
for
a
reply
however
they
opened
fire
and
franks
then
turned
and
retired
he
had
not
gone
far
before
he
was
struck
the
bullet
going
through
his
back
and
coming
out
just
below
the
heart
he
managed
to
stick
on
his
saddle
till
he
reached
lieutenant
pugh
who
caught
his
horse
by
the
head
and
led
him
towards
the
kopje
above
mentioned
as
occupied
by
us
franks
was
in
such
pain
that
he
was
unable
to
bear
the
jolting
of
the
horse
and
so
he
had
to
be
laid
down
on
the
plain
for
the
time
being
lieutenant
pugh
and
other
men
who
had
come
up
in
the
meantime
then
retired
to
the
kopje
to
report
the
state
of
affairs
to
colonel
lumsden
all
this
time
of
course
the
bullets
were
whistling
about
and
the
wonder
is
that
not
more
of
us
were
shot
two
men
were
then
sent
in
search
of
our
doctor
and
colonel
lumsden
as
soon
as
he
heard
what
had
happened
immediately
ordered
his
horse
and
accompanied
by
his
orderly
percy
smith
of
a
company
and
private
betts
of
b
company
on
chapman
of
b
company
having
previously
gone
down
on
foot
on
the
same
errand
of
forward
to
the
spot
on
reaching
it
our
gallant
colonel
insisted
on
dismounting
and
placing
franks
on
his
horse
saying
the
animal
was
a
quiet
one
and
notwithstanding
the
urgent
requests
of
the
others
that
he
would
allow
them
to
give
up
one
of
their
horses
to
him
he
insisted
on
walking
the
whole
distance
quite
regardless
of
the
hail
of
bullets
round
him
progress
was
naturally
slow
as
franks
complained
of
severe
pain
but
at
last
the
kopje
was
reached
none
of
the
party
getting
a
scratch
they
had
a
narrow
escape
the
boers
had
evidently
got
the
range
to
a
nicety
they
then
started
a
brisk
rifle
fire
on
the
kopje
we
were
on
which
we
returned
at
every
opportunity
but
they
kept
themselves
so
well
under
cover
that
we
had
very
poor
chances
of
doing
them
any
serious
damage
from
our
side
they
gradually
crept
up
closer
and
closer
coming
down
by
twos
and
threes
from
a
kopje
about
two
thousand
yards
away
and
taking
up
their
position
eventually
behind
a
slope
eight
to
nine
hundred
yards
distant
a
regular
artillery
duel
several
of
their
shells
bursting
among
the
and
our
own
maxim
but
not
doing
much
damage
i
fancy
our
guns
did
a
bit
of
killing
though
the
boers
afterwards
acknowledged
to
four
wounded
only
our
maxim
gave
a
very
good
account
of
itself
i
understand
our
only
casualties
in
this
direction
were
two
or
three
wounded
horses
we
were
told
afterwards
that
the
operations
were
only
intended
to
be
a
reconnaissance
in
force
to
find
out
the
strength
and
position
after
which
large
forces
from
the
left
and
right
would
attempt
to
surround
them
this
being
the
case
at
about
we
had
been
under
fire
for
about
four
hours
a
general
retirement
was
ordered
from
the
right
the
boers
seeing
us
retiring
were
evidently
emboldened
to
throw
aside
their
usual
cautious
tactics
and
advanced
on
us
rapidly
very
nearly
rushing
the
kopje
on
which
we
were
before
we
could
get
away
the
horse
which
had
been
tied
to
a
tree
got
away
and
he
would
have
been
badly
left
as
in
the
hasty
retreat
we
were
obliged
to
make
it
was
impossible
to
say
who
had
gone
on
and
who
was
left
behind
but
fortunately
riley
was
standing
near
a
bush
close
by
and
private
were
who
was
just
going
off
stopped
behind
and
helped
to
get
hold
of
we
then
started
to
gallop
off
but
just
then
another
man
came
running
towards
us
much
exhausted
with
scrambling
down
the
kopje
and
were
saying
he
was
quite
fresh
pluckily
got
off
and
lent
him
his
horse
fortunately
at
that
moment
captain
taylor
our
adjutant
galloped
up
with
a
spare
horse
and
were
getting
mounted
we
all
made
away
for
our
lives
we
halted
at
a
place
some
distance
off
and
it
was
only
then
we
heard
of
our
long
tale
of
casualties
a
company
suffered
very
heavily
on
the
left
flank
where
part
of
them
were
lying
in
an
exposed
position
besides
this
there
were
several
men
missing
and
it
was
not
till
we
got
into
camp
in
the
evening
after
was
taken
that
the
exact
extent
of
our
loss
was
known
franks
was
left
on
the
kopje
with
an
orderly
as
it
was
impossible
to
move
him
and
we
heard
next
day
that
he
was
taken
to
the
boer
hospital
and
died
there
at
the
same
night
among
the
wounded
was
fraser
well
known
in
sporting
circles
in
calcutta
he
had
his
horse
shot
under
him
and
was
himself
wounded
in
the
thigh
and
captured
by
the
boers
our
ambulance
went
out
next
day
and
found
that
the
boers
had
buried
all
the
dead
except
major
showers
whose
body
was
brought
back
to
camp
and
buried
there
the
service
was
a
very
impressive
one
and
was
conducted
by
the
military
chaplain
attached
to
the
regiment
camped
close
by
it
was
calculated
to
bring
home
to
us
all
the
stern
realities
of
war
yet
in
a
diary
immediately
after
the
most
pathetic
entry
we
find
it
recorded
that
when
rations
were
to
be
distributed
by
a
process
of
division
and
subdivision
argued
at
great
length
that
of
could
not
be
the
same
as
of
and
the
discussion
took
a
heated
turn
such
are
the
trifles
that
seem
important
to
men
who
have
just
come
out
of
a
battle
in
which
perhaps
they
were
more
than
once
close
to
the
jaws
of
death
in
those
brilliant
impressions
of
the
war
in
truthful
in
fact
but
not
invariably
just
in
recorded
a
very
similar
incident
at
vaal
krantz
when
from
a
fire
that
was
deafening
bewildering
in
its
intensity
of
concentration
on
the
british
front
some
died
some
were
carried
away
on
dripping
stretchers
before
they
could
learn
the
full
gamut
and
the
survivors
the
few
within
the
during
a
lucid
interval
in
the
shelling
the
regimental
cooks
had
contrived
to
make
and
distribute
tea
to
the
men
lying
prone
in
their
shelters
the
distribution
was
not
perhaps
impartial
the
menace
of
a
shrapnel
would
make
a
uncertain
with
the
eyes
of
a
hundred
government
inspectors
glued
upon
it
so
there
arose
a
bickering
tom
down
below
must
obviously
have
taken
more
than
his
share
else
how
came
it
that
mick
above
had
to
content
himself
with
less
yelled
the
monstrous
shrapnel
at
the
height
of
the
argument
up
snapped
the
shells
boomed
the
not
a
bit
of
it
no
projectile
ever
fired
shall
stop
a
briton
well
under
way
with
a
grievance
that
argument
flourished
amazingly
under
the
shower
and
only
died
away
when
the
glaring
sun
overhead
began
to
induce
an
unforgiving
slumber
ridiculous
of
course
such
a
scene
must
seem
to
civilians
who
have
been
fed
on
the
heroics
of
a
melodramatic
school
or
on
the
still
falser
of
writers
who
having
never
seen
a
battle
mix
their
own
pusillanimous
imaginings
with
studies
and
ironically
brand
that
mixture
with
the
badge
of
but
it
is
true
to
the
nature
of
soldiers
who
are
not
always
thinking
great
things
while
they
do
them
and
who
have
often
a
laugh
or
an
oath
on
their
lips
when
their
thoughts
take
a
flight
too
serious
for
words
has
told
us
how
in
the
midst
of
a
duel
that
was
practically
for
life
or
death
between
some
boers
and
horse
in
this
fight
at
ospruit
men
laughed
outright
at
something
that
seemed
to
them
funny
coming
as
it
did
like
the
joke
in
the
middle
of
a
a
soldier
should
make
the
best
of
valets
because
he
is
never
a
hero
to
himself
yet
he
has
a
firm
and
faith
in
the
heroism
of
others
horse
many
of
them
in
imminent
peril
at
the
moment
watched
their
action
in
going
out
to
bring
the
wounded
trooper
franks
from
a
slope
to
some
place
of
comparative
safety
and
they
afterwards
declared
it
to
be
a
valorous
deed
well
worthy
of
the
victoria
cross
to
that
conclusion
sir
patrick
playfair
also
came
when
the
story
was
told
to
him
and
he
said
so
thereupon
colonel
lumsden
was
much
upset
lest
somebody
might
say
that
he
too
had
been
trying
to
win
the
coveted
distinction
so
he
hastened
to
write
a
in
these
words
what
sir
patrick
really
means
and
heard
about
from
some
of
my
men
referred
to
the
death
of
poor
franks
who
was
lying
wounded
on
the
veldt
about
yards
from
the
point
we
held
on
the
extreme
right
of
the
fighting
line
we
could
see
him
plainly
through
our
glasses
writhing
evidently
in
great
pain
and
as
i
asked
for
some
volunteers
to
ride
down
and
bring
him
in
i
did
not
care
to
request
them
to
do
a
thing
i
would
not
do
myself
so
rode
down
with
my
galloper
trooper
percy
smith
now
a
captain
in
the
middlesex
regiment
and
a
and
trooper
betts
and
trooper
chapman
the
latter
of
whom
afterwards
obtained
a
commission
in
the
johannesburg
police
on
reaching
the
spot
we
found
franks
lying
in
great
danger
and
pain
having
a
quiet
pony
stuart
i
dismounted
and
we
placed
the
wounded
man
on
my
horse
and
while
he
was
held
by
two
of
his
comrades
we
walked
back
to
camp
under
a
pretty
heavy
fire
from
some
boers
who
were
galloping
on
our
left
rear
and
firing
at
us
it
was
a
foolish
thing
on
my
part
to
have
done
but
as
i
said
we
were
all
new
to
the
game
together
and
i
did
not
care
to
ask
my
men
to
risk
their
lives
in
an
action
in
which
i
would
not
chance
my
own
that
is
all
there
was
nothing
in
it
yes
that
is
all
but
let
england
mother
of
nations
thank
god
for
the
sons
who
doing
such
a
deed
can
say
and
think
was
nothing
in
cold
reason
may
bid
us
approve
general
charles
words
of
wise
caution
but
all
the
time
our
hearts
will
be
beating
time
to
a
noble
refrain
the
notes
of
which
have
thrilled
the
nerves
of
british
soldiers
in
all
ages
urging
them
to
risk
their
own
lives
rather
than
forsake
a
stricken
comrade
and
to
die
like
gentlemen
before
they
would
let
the
stain
of
dishonour
rest
on
them
or
their
regiment
people
who
talk
glibly
of
the
necessity
for
encouraging
initiative
among
junior
officers
may
hold
that
lieutenant
crane
should
have
conformed
to
the
general
retirement
instead
of
holding
his
isolated
post
with
untimely
resolution
waiting
for
the
orders
that
could
not
reach
him
when
the
boers
began
to
close
in
on
his
front
and
flanks
apparently
no
blame
attaches
to
anybody
for
neglecting
to
recall
lieutenant
crane
and
his
party
at
a
time
when
they
might
have
extricated
themselves
without
serious
loss
colonel
ross
says
that
the
orderly
whom
he
sent
with
the
message
was
either
killed
or
wounded
and
so
the
recall
never
reached
lieutenant
crane
that
it
was
sent
both
colonel
ross
and
his
staff
officer
captain
williams
who
has
since
been
killed
were
quite
positive
in
justice
to
lieutenant
crane
it
must
be
remembered
that
a
company
officer
can
know
very
little
of
what
is
going
on
at
other
points
of
a
fighting
line
beyond
the
immediate
limits
assigned
to
him
and
the
privilege
of
initiative
might
be
strained
to
a
dangerous
extent
if
every
should
consider
it
discreet
to
retire
directly
he
found
himself
pressed
sorely
or
somebody
else
giving
way
on
either
flank

of

times
in
the
course
of
our
island
has
the
empire
had
cause
to
be
thankful
to
the
men
who
could
thus
interpret
duty
as
a
thing
above
all
personal
considerations
calling
for
to
the
end
it
was
part
of
the
white
burden
which
lieutenant
crane
and
his
comrades
of
no
section
had
taken
upon
them
long
ago
when
they
settled
as
in
the
wilds
of
behar
mozufferpore
and
saran
where
europeans
are
few
and
natives
many
in
such
districts
the
lot
may
be
to
face
a
riotous
multitude
of
frenzied
fanatics
at
any
moment
and
he
must
fight
it
out
dying
if
need
be
under
cruel
torture
but
never

fear
that

the
from
which
no

of
a

came
they
were
to
a
man
and
imbued
with
a
high
sense
of
the
responsibility
to
the
race
from
which
he
springs
knowing
this
we
can
not
wonder
that
the
leader
deemed
it
his
duty
to
fight
for
the
ground
he
had
been
ordered
to
hold
rather
than
give
way

inch

were
against
him

were
lying
under

fire
and
elected
to
stay
with

were

in

numb

atoned
for

proud
an
early
version
of
this
incident
not
quite
accurate
in
some
details
furnished
a
noble
theme
for
the
pen
of
sir
conan
doyle
who
in
his
history
of
great
boer
war
writes
with
a
enthusiasm
and
an
glorious
disregard
of
fettering
figures
as
follows
before
entering
upon
a
description
of
that
great
and
decisive
movement
the
advance
on
pretoria
one
small
action
calls
for
comment
this
was
the
cutting
off
of
twenty
men
of
horse
in
a
reconnaissance
at
karree
the
small
post
under
lieutenant
crane
found
themselves
by
some
misunderstanding
isolated
in
the
midst
of
the
enemy
refusing
to
hoist
the
flag
of
shame
they
fought
their
way
out
losing
half
their
number
while
of
the
other
half
it
is
said
that
there
was
not
one
who
could
not
show
bullet
marks
upon
his
clothes
or
person
the
men
of
this
corps
volunteer
had
abandoned
the
ease
and
even
luxury
of
eastern
life
for
the
hard
fare
and
rough
fighting
of
this
most
trying
campaign
in
coming
they
had
set
the
whole
empire
an
in
spirit
and
now
on
their
first
field
they
set
the
army
an
example
of
military
virtue
the
proud
traditions
of
volunteers
have
been
upheld
by
the

unsympathetic
critics
may
discover
a
lack
of
due
proportion
in
the
space
that
has
been
devoted
to
this
affair
at
ospruit
seeing
that
it
was
but
an
episode
in
a
long
chain
of
operations
the
whole
of
which
are
dealt
with
in
a
single
paragraph
of
the
despatches
but
the
same
argument
might
be
urged
against
any
enlargement
in
monograph
on
the
official
version
of
brilliant
march
for
relieving
mafeking
to
which
no
writer
has
done
full
justice
yet
though
there
is
evidence
that
the
boers
regarded
it
as
the
first
achieved
by
a
british
commander
and
as
a
stroke
of
daring
leadership
by
which
they
were
completely
outwitted
many
similar
examples
not
so
conspicuous
perhaps
but
all
material
in
their
bearing
on
the
greater
issues
of
a
campaign
and
therefore
worthy
of
elaborate
treatment
in
detail
might
be
quoted
the
editor
can
at
any
rate
plead
that
this
is
a
history
of
horse
and
not
an
essay
in
perspective
for
that
reason
he
has
chosen
to
reproduce
impressions
of
the
different
incidents
not
as
they
might
have
presented
themselves
to
the
mind
of
a
divisional
general
or
an
unemotional
spectator
but
as
they
burnt
themselves
in
upon
the
brains
of
men
actually
fighting
for
their
lives
and
to
use
as
nearly
as
possible
each
own
words
it
may
seem
strange
that
through
all
these
narratives
from
the
purposely
restrained
and
undemonstrative
summary
to
the
details
that
are
told
with
most
convincing
force
we
can
trace
no
signs
of
depression
resulting
from
the
fact
that
horse
in
their
first
fight
were
forced
to
retire
instead
of
taking
part
in
a
victorious
advance
this
is
a
touch
happily
characteristic
of
british
soldiers
conscious
of
having
done
their
duty
manfully
they
were
content
to
let
the
issue
be
what
it
might
so
long
as
they
had
not
lost
confidence
in
themselves
or
in
their
leaders
there
was
nothing
of
the
beaten
soldier
about
them
no
demoralisation
no
sullen
discontent
no
sham
heroics
covering
a
sense
of
discomfiture
whether
they
had
to
come
back
from
their
sacrifices
because
the
enemy
was
in
superior
force
or
simply
because
the
object
of
a
reconnaissance
been
achieved
mattered
little
to
them
as
tommy
would
have
phrased
it
in
his
expressive
way
was
all
in
the
victory
is
sweet
no
doubt
and
men
from
whose
lips
that
cup
has
been
dashed
can
not
but
feel
a
little
bitterness
in
their
hearts
but
it
is
only
the
bitterness
of
a
wholesome
tonic
for
soldiers
who
have
suffered
so
there
is
always
consolation
in
the
knowledge
that
their
sacrifices
were
not
borne
in
vain
and
horse
may
take
satisfaction
from
the
thought
that
their
first
fight
with
all
its
sad
and
glorious
consequence
was
not
brought
about
by
any
useless
demonstration
without
plan
or
purpose
though
none
of
them
could
know
it
at
the
time
they
had
been
engaged
with
de
la
force
by
which
general
ian
left
flank
was
being
seriously
threatened
along
the
brandfort
ridges
and
their
action
which
seemed
to
them
indecisive
had
so
far
relieved
the
pressure
that
sir
ian
was
able
the
next
day
to
deliver
his
attack
on
houtnek
and
drive
the
boers
from
it
in
some
confusion
the
apparent
failure
of
general
brigade
to
carry
out
the
mission
assigned
to
it
in
the
flanking
movement
mentioned
by
colonel
lumsden
may
be
accounted
for
by
the
fact
that
some
of
the
brandfort
commandos
finding
themselves
in
danger
of
being
cut
off
had
drawn
back
from
the
contemplated
movement
against
ian
hamilton
and
thrown
themselves
into
the
fight
that
was
then
raging
about
the
spurs
and
kopjes
of
the
range
from
which
ospruit
springs
thus
they
outnumbered
many
times
the
mounted
troops
under
colonel
henry
who
having
achieved
his
object
wisely
retired
from
the
left
leaving
the
boers
in
occupation
of
the
ground
they
had
won
but
leaving
them
also
held
firmly
in
check
there
by
infantry
brigades
whose
presence
prevented
any
further
demonstration
from
brandfort
against
ian
left
when
horse
marched
back
to
their
camp
that
night
therefore
they
might
have
congratulated
they
having
done
remarkably
good
service
by
something
more
than
a
reconnaissance
in
force
the
immediate
result
may
be
summed
up
in
a
few
words
general
hamilton
reinforced
by
another
infantry
brigade
and
by
general
cavalry
who
rejoined
him
from
thaba
way
during
the
night
was
enabled
to
advance
early
on
may
and
strike
a
strong
blow
by
which
as
lord
roberts
said
in
his
despatch
enemy
was
signally
defeated
at
houtnek
with
comparatively
small
loss
on
our
side
thanks
to
the
admirable
dispositions
made
by
ian
to
this
comment
lord
roberts
adds
an
expression
of
regret
that
the
troops
employed
at
dewetsdorp
and
wepener
had
been
unable
to
cut
off
the
retreat
and
capture
his
guns
but
during
these
operations
the
boers
being
evidently
prepared
for
retreat
whenever
their
safety
might
be
threatened
moved
with
very
little
baggage
each
fighting
man
carrying
his
blankets
and
food
on
a
led
horse
it
followed
therefore
that
they
could
escape
without
suffering
any
loss
beyond
that
inflicted
by
our
troops
in
dislodging
them
from
their
positions
this
was
practically
the
official
explanation
to
which
one
may
add
that
cavalry
alone
could
not
follow
up
effectively
the
retreat
of
mounted
infantry
every
man
of
which
knew
the
country
and
how
to
utilise
its
peculiarities
for
checking
pursuit
by
his
masterly
stroke
at
houtnek
however
general
hamilton
had
achieved
something
more
than
the
capture
of
a
boer
stronghold
at
the
end
of
that
action
his
troops
were
astride
of
the
most
formidable
defensive
position
between
bloemfontein
and
vaal
river
and
an
unopposed
advance
two
days
later
to
isabellafontein
not
only
took
the
entrenchments
on
that
side
of
brandfort
completely
in
reverse
but
also
effectually
prevented
de
wet
from
with
de
la
rey
or
botha
and
thus
opened
a
way
for
the
general
movement
towards
pretoria
thus
the
fight
at
ospruit
though
it
ended
in
a
retirement
against
which
some
of
the
more
adventurous
spirits
chafed
was
a
demonstration
that
helped
materially
towards
the
development
of
more
important
schemes
and
to
horse
belongs
the
honour
of
having
given
to
this
affair
an
imperishable
distinction
by
sacrifices
that
may
have
been
unnecessary
but
were
certainly
not
inglorious
the
men
who
risked
their
lives
and
liberty
as
firth
macdonald
and
williams
did
in
gallant
efforts
to
rescue
their
wounded
officer
from
a
position
which
he
had
attempted
to
hold
too
long
are
as
worthy
to
be
remembered
as
those
who
met
their
deaths
in
the
fighting
line
to
the
fallen
monuments
have
already
been
raised
above
the
grave
of
young
harry
lumsden
who
was
buried
beside
daubney
and
case
on
the
battlefield
a
cross
was
put
up
by
the
boers
themselves
who
finding
letters
in
his
pocket
mistook
him
for
the
colonel
commanding
horse
and
buried
him
with
the
respect
that
they
considered
due
to
a
brave
enemy
and
leader
of
men
in
the
old
camp
at
spytfontein
to
which
the
body
of
major
showers
was
borne
the
next
day
another
simple
memorial
pathetically
distinguished
by
its
loneliness
was
raised
by
the
comrades
who
paid
their
sorrowing
tribute
to
him
there
but
brought
away
memories
of
his
soldierly
qualities
which
they
have
honoured
since
by
a
more
sumptuous
monument
in
bengal
the
old
soldier
would
probably
have
wished
for
no
higher
honour
than
the
esteem
of
comrades
whom
he
had
trained
in
times
of
peace
and
among
whom
he
fell
in
their
first
fight
how
sincere
that
esteem
was
may
be
gathered
from
simple
narratives
sent
home
by
officers
and
men
of
horse
whose
letters
give
incidental
glimpses
of
heroic
actions
that
might
otherwise
have
passed
into
oblivion
walker
officiating
commandant
issued
the
following
regimental
order
from
the
headquarters
of
the
surma
valley
light
horse
silchar
dated
july
as
everybody
connected
with
the
corps
will
no
doubt
wish
to
hear
details
of
the
death
in
action
of
our
late
commandant
eden
showers
i
publish
for
information
below
particulars
from
a
letter
received
by
the
adjutant
from
captain
chamney
of
horse
written
the
day
after
the
action
in
which
colonel
showers
lost
his
life
captain
chamney
says
our
corps
were
given
the
honour
of
the
advance
the
the
honour
of
the
first
of
that
and
with
lumsden
and
old
showers
at
our
head
we
occupied
the
kopje
that
was
said
to
be
the
key
of
the
whole
position
but
were
instantly
subjected
to
a
heavy
musketry
fire
we
lost
one
man
and
horse
scouting
and
then
got
settled
down
among
some
sangars
but
the
old
major
scorned
all
cover
watching
absolutely
regardless
of
the
bullets
the
advance
up
a
spruit
on
our
right
flank
everyone
had
asked
him
to
get
down
but
he
always
said
all
right
and
walked
from
one
end
of
the
line
to
the
other
when
all
the
rest
had
begun
to
retire
and
we
got
no
word
the
boers
worked
up
closer
and
closer
i
had
only
just
said
to
him
he
was
but
three
or
four
yards
behind
me
sake
major
get
under
cover
when
i
heard
the
sing
of
bullets
over
my
head
and
and
looking
round
i
saw
he
was
hit
i
said
you
hit
major
and
he
replied
nothing
much
only
my
arm
send
back
for
i
crawled
back
on
my
belly
to
him
and
got
his
belts
and
things
opened
and
found
also
a
big
hole
just
above
the
heart
which
was
bleeding
copiously
then
powell
and
two
assistants
came
up
and
we
bandaged
him
as
well
as
we
could
for
bullets
flying
around
and
still
on
our
bellies
pulled
and
lifted
the
old
chap
out
of
the
range
of
fire
he
was
suffering
evidently
a
good
deal
from
suffocation
blood
in
his
lungs
i
suppose
i
stayed
with
him
as
long
as
he
was
many
had
then
to
return
to
the
men
i
found
him
as
we
retired
a
little
later
there
under
the
tree
where
we
had
laid
him
and
where
we
had
to
leave
him
and
another
man
to
the
boers
the
came
before
he
died
and
powell
making
up
his
mind
to
stay
with
him
fixed
his
handkerchief
to
a
stick
to
get
what
protection
he
could
from
it
however
the
old
chap
dropped
off
and
covering
him
with
a
blanket
and
closing
his
eyes
the
doctor
left
him
to
his
rest
and
bolted
but
looking
back
he
saw
the
white
flag
and
saying
would
the
old
man
say
if
he
knew
he
was
taken
even
dead
with
a
white
flag
over
him
returned
and
took
it
down
and
so
we
left
him
the
boers
took
nothing
but
his
spurs
and
badges
powell
returned
at
night
under
a
red
cross
and
got
permission
to
remove
the
body
and
we
bury
the
old
man
this
afternoon
it
is
a
terrible
loss
to
the
corps
and
all
so
utterly
sad
there
is
something
almost
homeric
in
that
incident
of
the
white
flag
being
taken
from
beside
the
dead
body
under
fire
the
of
of
may
contains
the
following
appreciation
of
the
gallant
major

among
those
of
horse
killed
in
the
fighting
in
the
orange
free
state
on
the
ult
was
major
eden
showers
he
was
until
recently
the
commandant
of
the
surma
valley
light
horse
and
by
his
example
exercised
a
wonderful
influence
over
all
ranks
he
was
a
son
of
general
showers
who
did
splendid
work
in
the
mutiny
days
and
made
his
name
famous
by
his
courageous
leading
of
the
assault
at
delhi
on

surma
valley
light
horse
in
march
in
succession
to
colonel
milne
and
his
nomination
was
ratified
by
the
government
the
selection
proved
that
the
government
had
put
the
right
man
in
the
right
place
while
in
command
he
worked
the
light
horse
up
to
a
high
degree
of
efficiency
as
was
shown
by
the
approval
of
general
sir
george
luck
who
at
the
inspection
in
december
last
gave
them
unstinted
praise
among
other
things
the
general
stated
that
he
could
honestly
say
that
the
regiment
could
hold
its
own
with
the
best
yeomanry
corps
at

was
saying
a
great
deal
shortly
after
his
resignation
of
the
command
of
the
surma
valley
light
horse
colonel
showers
joined
horse
as
with
the
rank
of
major
serving
under
his
old
friend
and
former
subordinate
colonel
lumsden
his
death
is
a
severe
loss
to
the
corps
and
is
deeply
deplored
by
a
very
large
circle
of
friends
who
found
in
him
a
man
of
sterling
merit
splendid
character
and
a
credit
to
the
military
profession
he
was
so
keen
in
following
the
following
appears
in
the
the
officiating
chief
commissioner
expresses
the
general
feeling
of
the
province
in
deploring
the
death
in
action
of
major
showers
of
the
indian
mounted
infantry
corps
horse
now
serving
in
south
africa
as
commandant
of
the
surma
valley
light
horse
for
nearly
five
years
he
brought
that
body
to
a
high
state
of
efficiency
by
his
soldierly
qualities
his
untiring
devotion
to
the
interests
of
the
corps
and
by
his
personal
popularity
among
its
members
his
untimely
death
is
a
serious
loss
to
assam
and
will
be
mourned
by
the
officers
and
men
of
the
corps
he
was
loved
by
all
who
knew
him
the
hon
cotton
chief
commissioner
of
assam
now
sir
henry
cotton
presiding
at
the
assam
dinner
in
london
in
june
paid
the
following
tribute
to
major
showers
another
gentleman
had
been
pathetically
alluded
to
both
by
colonel
kirwan
and
colonel
maclaughlin
and
the
mention
of
his
name
recalled
a
recent
public
dinner
at
cachar
given
as
a
to
colonel
showers
and
other
volunteers
the
admiration
which
all
the
volunteers
of
assam
had
for
colonel
showers
was
indeed
a
thing
to
have
witnessed
when
he
rose
to
propose
colonel
health
the
cheering
was
vociferous
and
so
continuous
that
it
was
at
least
ten
minutes
before
he
could
get
any
hearing
he
had
never
been
present
at
a
scene
of
such
extraordinary
enthusiasm
and
he
believed
it
was
thoroughly
well
deserved
colonel
showers
was
an
exceptional
man
thoroughly
straightforward
and
practical
and
a
born
leader
of
men
what
was
said
of
jim
bludso
might
with
equal
truth
be
said
of
colonel
showers
keerless
man
in
his
talk
was
jim
and
an
awkward
hand
in
a
row
but
he
never
funked
and
he
never
lied
i
reckon
he
never
that
was
the
type
of
man
that
colonel
showers
englishman
true
and
staunch
as
steel
and
courageous
to
the
backbone
as
colonel
kirwan
had
told
them
he
died
as
he
would
have
wished
to
die
a
death
he
was
a
soldier
in
his
youth
and
became
a
soldier
in
his
prime
and
died
for
queen
and
country
they
were
all
proud
of
horse
and
of
colonel
showers
who
died
at
the
head
of
his
men
in
the
first
battle
in
which
they
were
engaged
from
these
extracts
and
especially
from
the
episode
in
which
powell
played
such
a
gallant
part
we
may
know
that
the
surma
valley
light
horse
were
worthy
of
the
colonel
who
had
volunteered
to
serve
in
a
subordinate
capacity
that
he
might
be
with
them
in
their
first
campaign
and
whose
memory
they
still
revere
that
all
assam
may
bear
in
mind
how
he
had
endeared
himself
to
those
who
served
with
him
the
men
of
that
corps
have
caused
a
handsome
monument
to
be
wrought
in
red
aberdeen
granite
for
erection
in
the
country
where
they
first
enlisted
as
volunteers
under
his
command
its
gabled
base
forms
a
gothic
cross
surmounted
by
an
octagonal
spire
and
in
one
panel
under
a
cusped
arch
is
the
following
inscription
to
the
memory
of
eden
currie
showers
late
commandant
surma
valley
light
horse
killed
at
houtnek
south
africa
april
erected
by
the
members
of
his
corps
before
this
monument
was
shipped
from
glasgow
to
calcutta
in
september
a
sketch
of
it
was
sent
by
peters
who
had
taken
charge
of
all
arrangements
to
lord
roberts
in
acknowledgment
the
wrote
i
have
received
with
much
pleasure
your
letter
of
the
instant
enclosing
a
drawing
of
the
obelisk
that
is
being
erected
by
the
members
of
the
surma
valley
light
horse
in
memory
of
their
late
gallant
commandant
showers
and
i
am
much
obliged
to
you
for
sending
it
to
me
i
am
glad
the
memorial
is
being
erected
as
i
feel
sure
it
will
go
far
towards
preserving
and
promoting
that
de
which
is
so
important
a
factor
in
all
units
of
the
forces
of
the
british
empire
it
was
de
as
colonel
lumsden
expressed
it
in
the
regimental
motto
the
game
that
brought
officers
and
troopers
with
distinction
through
their
first
fight
and
the
firmness
with
which
it
had
taken
hold
of
all
ranks
may
be
traced
in
tributes
that
show
the
finest
spirit
of
comradeship
the
following
letter
received
by
colonel
rendell
commanding
the
east
indian
railway
volunteer
rifles
from
captain
holmes
who
went
with
the
maxim
gun
of
the
rifles
attached
to
horse
is
full
of
the
sentiment
from
which
mutual
confidence
springs
spytfontein
may
dear
colonel
rendell
am
writing
to
give
you
an
account
of
the
first
action
the
gun
has
been
in
and
to
tell
you
how
admirably
the
men
behaved
in
what
were
really
very
trying
circumstances
when
we
left
calcutta
i
had
the
gun
arranged
to
go
on
pack
saddles
on
horses
but
when
we
arrived
here
we
found
this
would
not
do
as
our
animals
were
not
properly
trained
and
in
jumping
about
they
were
always
knocking
pieces
of
skin
off
and
otherwise
damaging
themselves
we
therefore
fitted
up
one
of
our
transport
carts
as
a
carriage
and
with
two
mules
as
wheelers
and
four
horses
in
front
we
get
along
pretty
well
the
first
day
we
went
out
to
fight
we
saw
nothing
although
there
was
a
little
firing
about
two
miles
from
us
on
the
way
we
came
to
a
very
nasty
piece
of
ground
and
we
succeeded
in
turning
the
gun
head
over
heels
down
the
side
of
a
kopje
by
a
miracle
it
was
not
injured
in
the
least
and
i
felt
sure
it
must
be
going
to
do
some
work
yesterday
we
went
out
again
and
had
only
gone
about
four
miles
when
firing
began
all
along
the
line
we
were
on
the
right
next
to
a
the
boer
guns
very
soon
found
out
the
latter
and
it
had
to
be
moved
out
of
action
in
the
meanwhile
i
had
been
having
a
go
at
the
boer
gunners
at
about
yards
no
sooner
had
the
gone
than
a
shell
missed
my
head
by
about
a
foot
fell
twenty
yards
behind
me
and
burst
wounding
four
of
my
horses
slightly
this
quite
good
enough
and
i
got
out
of
action
as
soon
as
i
could
but
not
before
they
had
sent
two
more
shells
right
among
us
or
too
close
to
be
pleasant
the
last
one
killed
two
horses
and
blew
a
foot
to
pieces
the
boers
outnumbered
us
by
about
four
to
one
and
shortly
after
this
we
received
an
order
to
retire
with
the
rest
which
we
did
we
had
gone
about
half
a
mile
with
rifle
bullets
sprinkling
around
us
when
i
was
ordered
to
come
into
action
behind
a
few
stones
that
were
lying
on
the
plain
there
an
atom
of
cover
for
my
horses
or
the
men
holding
them
although
the
gun
was
partly
protected
i
opened
fire
on
the
boers
at
yards
had
fired
about
rounds
of
rapid
traversing
fire
when
they
began
to
retire
i
fired
about
another
when
the
gun
jammed
and
at
the
same
moment
an
officer
came
dashing
up
to
tell
me
to
retire
immediately
we
did
so
under
a
perfect
hail
of
bullets
and
although
i
had
six
horses
wounded
out
of
ten
not
one
of
them
was
so
badly
injured
as
to
be
unable
to
go
on
and
not
a
single
man
of
us
was
touched
after
going
about
half
a
mile
i
gave
my
horse
to
corbett
to
lead
and
got
into
the
cart
and
managed
to
get
the
gun
into
action
again
we
lost
three
belts
and
boxes
in
our
hasty
retirement
but
that
of
course
could
not
be
helped
the
men
with
me
were
sergeant
bale
of
jubbulpur
private
booth
of
howrah
privates
dowd
dickens
corbett
and
burnand
of
jamalpur
and
private
bolst
of
asonsole
private
burnand
is
my
driver
there
was
one
other
man
of
horse
with
me
named
mercer
who
was
helping
to
hold
horses
sergeant
dale
privates
booth
corbett
and
bolst
and
myself
were
on
the
gun
colonel
ross
who
was
in
charge
of
our
brigade
expressed
pleasure
at
the
work
done
by
the
gun
and
said
that
we
knocked
over
several
of
the
enemy
which
was
distinctly
satisfactory
our
casualties
were
heavy
we
lost
our
major
showers
killed
lieutenant
crane
missing
and
wounded
and
one
private
known
to
be
killed
and
probably
one
or
two
others
of
the
wounded
have
since
died
our
killed
wounded
and
missing
being
seventeen
in
all
how
our
team
escaped
injury
is
to
me
little
short
of
a
miracle
the
men
behaved
splendidly
and
if
ever
we
get
into
as
tight
a
place
again
i
have
perfect
confidence
in
their
standing
by
me
and
the
gun
our
ambulance
is
out
now
looking
for
wounded
but
the
boers
have
probably
attended
to
them
long
any
rate
i
hope
so
our
men
have
certainly
had
their
baptism
of
fire
and
i
for
one
should
not
object
if
we
never
got
it
as
hot
again
you
would
hardly
recognise
the
gun
now
i
fancy
it
is
a
dirty
khaki
colour
with
the
paint
knocked
off
it
in
places
and
smothered
with
dirt
and
stuff
outside
but
the
inside
is
i
think
quite
as
clean
as
when
at
jamalpur
anyhow
it
still
knows
how
to
work
yours
very
sincerely
holmes
from
the
personal
experiences
of
a
officer
who
was
wounded
and
captured
by
the
boers
we
get
that
help
more
than
anything
else
towards
a
clear
understanding
of
the
temper
and
actions
of
men
on
the
battlefield
to
some
extent
this
story
touches
on
ground
that
has
already
been
covered
by
previous
descriptions
partly
for
that
reason
but
mainly
because
it
is
a
complete
picture
of
one
incident
the
nobility
of
which
would
have
been
lost
if
woven
into
the
continuous
narrative
it
has
been
kept
distinct
so
that
the
impressions
may
be
reproduced
here
with
all
the
minor
touches
and
bits
of
local
colour
that
made
them
vivid
at
the
time
of
occurrence
he
begins
with
the
march
out
of
camp
at
that
memorable
morning
we
fell
in
punctually
and
moved
off
to
the
rendezvous
the
moon
shining
brightly
and
making
wonderful
black
shadows
among
the
surrounding
by
the
way
the
cold
was
intense
and
numbed
our
fingers
so
that
our
reins
could
scarce
be
felt
the
order
to
trot
was
received
with
satisfaction
for
we
were
all
shivering
men
and
horses
alike
a
few
minutes
later
we
joined
company
with
a
battery
of
two
guns
and
a
body
of
mounted
infantry
composed
of
australians
and
details
from
various
regiments
our
strength
in
all
was
we
have
since
heard
some
while
the
opposing
boers
numbered
three
or
four
thousand
with
several
big
guns
when
our
little
band
was
complete
the
order
was
given
to
trot
and
we
proceeded
at
a
sharp
pace
for
about
a
mile
daylight
was
then
breaking
and
a
halt
was
called
the
order
being
given
to
dismount
and
charge
sign
of
business
received
with
much
satisfaction
thereafter
we
moved
forward
in
extended
order
with
scouts
in
advance
for
three
or
four
miles
when
stray
shots
in
front
showed
us
that
we
were
coming
into
touch
with
the
enemy
before
us
the
country
lay
in
ridges
running
parallel
with
each
other
and
at
right
angles
to
our
line
of
advance
as
we
surmounted
each
rising
we
expected
to
view
the
enemy
but
the
order
to
dismount
came
without
our
being
vouchsafed
any
visible
sign
of
their
presence
before
us
lay
some
yards
of
rising
ground
and
we
swarmed
up
in
a
long
open
line
fully
expecting
a
volley
ere
we
reached
the
top
however
our
hour
of
trial
had
not
yet
come
though
the
scattered
shots
heard
to
our
front
as
we
advanced
had
increased
to
a
sharp
fusillade
on
our
left
front
the
order
then
came
to
extend
away
into
a
narrow
valley
running
at
right
angles
and
crossing
the
ends
of
the
succession
of
ridges
we
had
covered
thus
lying
on
the
slope
we
could
see
behind
for
a
mile
or
so
and
in
the
opposite
direction
up
the
valley
right
into
the
country
which
the
enemy
were
known
to
occupy
shortly
afterwards
the
music
began
in
earnest
a
mile
up
the
valley
a
boer
big
gun
appeared
and
opened
fire
on
troops
advancing
on
the
hill
from
our
left
rear
then
out
came
one
of
our
and
galloping
into
position
replied
from
the
opposite
end
of
the
valley
at
a
range
of
some
yards
the
duel
between
the
two
lasted
for
about
ten
minutes
the
firing
briskly
as
is
its
wont
the
more
ponderous
boer
gun
replying
every
two
minutes
lying
on
the
slope
as
we
were
in
full
view
of
the
valley
and
within
a
hundred
yards
of
the
line
of
fire
of
the
opposing
guns
we
had
a
splendid
not
to
say
realistic
illustration
of
artillery
fire
the
singing
of
the
big
shells
as
they
tore
through
the
air
was
magnificent
to
our
unaccustomed
ears
it
was
curious
too
to
observe
the
sequence
in
which
indications
of
discharge
and
report
reached
us
the
first
sign
that
the
boer
big
gun
had
been
fired
was
the
little
cloud
of
smoke
floating
near
the
muzzle
next
we
heard
the
singing
of
the
shell
passing
up
the
valley
this
was
followed
by
the
dust
raised
by
the
explosion
of
the
shell
in
bursting
and
not
until
these
evidences
of
a
shot
having
been
fired
did
we
hear
the
actual
report
which
was
closely
followed
by
that
of
the
bursting
shell
itself
for
some
five
minutes
the
duel
proceeded
no
evidence
of
the
effect
of
the
fire
being
visible
to
our
eyes
though
it
became
evident
that
the
boers
were
finding
the
range
for
each
shell
seemed
to
land
nearer
until
as
it
seemed
to
us
one
burst
right
in
the
middle
of
our
gun
at
that
moment
those
of
us
on
the
slope
heard
rifle
fire
immediately
behind
it
proved
to
be
our
own
maxim
taking
sighting
shots
at
the
boer
gun
this
certainly
made
things
livelier
but
there
was
no
comfort
in
realising
that
we
lay
right
in
the
line
of
fire
and
that
replies
from
the
enemy
would
probably
land
among
us
however
the
boers
took
no
notice
of
the
maxim
though
it
spat
out
bullets
at
a
tremendous
rate
but
continued
to
devote
their
attention
to
the
the
greater
weight
of
the
boer
metal
soon
made
matters
too
hot
for
captain
little
gun
and
it
shortly
afterwards
retired
behind
the
hill
having
lost
several
horses
then
our
turn
came
and
the
officious
little
maxim
which
had
been
kicking
up
a
great
shindy
in
our
rear
drew
the
boer
fire
the
first
shot
whizzed
unpleasantly
close
to
our
heads
and
burst
between
us
and
the
maxim
which
undismayed
continued
to
pour
out
a
hot
fire
number
two
was
aimed
slightly
higher
and
travelled
beyond
the
gun
killing
two
horses
and
wounding
one
man
the
maxim
stuck
it
out
pluckily
for
one
more
shell
but
that
fell
so
close
that
to
have
delayed
any
longer
would
have
only
been
folly
on
the
retreat
of
our
machine
gun
the
boer
gun
retired
behind
a
kopje
and
we
were
left
in
peace
for
a
time
though
the
firing
on
our
left
had
now
greatly
increased
and
showed
that
a
brisk
fight
was
going
on
about
orders
were
received
for
part
of
my
section
to
extend
to
the
right
and
six
of
us
in
command
of
sergeant
walter
walker
went
right
down
into
the
valley
in
our
new
position
we
were
sheltered
by
a
low
rocky
ridge
on
the
left
but
the
ground
was
open
in
every
other
direction
the
ridge
referred
to
cut
us
off
entirely
from
what
was
going
on
on
our
left
and
this
accounts
for
the
misfortunes
which
followed
meanwhile
the
firing
that
had
begun
on
our
left
earlier
in
the
morning
had
increased
tremendously
bullets
began
to
come
our
way
very
frequently
but
as
we
were
under
the
lee
of
a
ridge
they
passed
over
our
heads
evidently
nearly
spent
for
the
sharp
ping
of
a
shot
had
changed
with
them
into
the
melancholy
wail
of
spirits
that
had
lived
and
lived
in
vain
so
great
had
the
noise
become
that
shouting
to
each
other
was
ineffectual
not
a
word
reaching
even
next
neighbour
so
we
lay
and
waited
suddenly
it
struck
us
that
the
chain
of
fire
extending
in
a
line
to
our
left
seemed
to
be
swinging
towards
our
left
rear
and
a
few
attention
confirmed
an
idea
that
the
position
of
the
opposing
forces
must
have
altered
considerably
as
we
listened
the
firing
seemed
to
increase
in
fierceness
and
sounded
still
further
to
the
rear
the
position
had
become
uncomfortable
for
our
horses
were
yards
in
our
direct
rear
to
lose
them
would
be
fatal
to
our
safety
the
six
of
us
therefore
got
up
and
began
to
retire
slowly
wondering
that
no
orders
had
reached
us
illustration
bugler
mackenzie
a
shower
of
bullets
swept
past
singing
in
our
ears
with
spiteful
distinctness
looking
round
i
saw
barely
fifty
yards
away
boers
kneeling
and
firing
away
for
all
they
were
worth
a
second
look
was
unnecessary
and
we
ran
like
deer
the
bullets
whizzing
by
thick
as
hail
it
was
amazing
that
none
of
us
was
hit
bullets
seemed
to
me
to
be
pouring
between
my
legs
and
under
my
feet
a
little
rising
gave
us
momentary
protection
but
the
boers
came
on
again
until
within
fifty
yards
and
poured
a
hot
fire
into
us
two
hundred
yards
away
we
could
see
our
horses
and
near
them
the
rest
of
the
section
which
had
got
earlier
notice
of
the
repulse
of
our
troops
galloping
away
each
man
got
to
his
horse
but
they
shouted
to
me
that
mine
had
been
killed
by
a
shell
it
was
not
a
pleasant
predicament
but
before
i
had
time
to
realise
that
the
boers
must
either
shoot
or
capture
me
bugler
mackenzie
galloped
up
and
offered
me
a
lift
behind
him
i
was
dead
beat
with
running
and
quite
unequal
to
violent
effort
i
put
my
foot
in
the
stirrup
he
released
and
tried
to
climb
up
but
my
bandolier
haversack
and
all
bunched
in
front
and
caught
the
blanket
tied
on
at
the
pommel
of
the
high
military
saddle
back
i
flopped
on
to
the
ground
another
effort
and
i
nearly
pulled
mackenzie
who
was
a
light
boy
out
of
the
saddle
the
firing
all
the
time
was
very
hot
and
fearing
to
bring
disaster
on
all
of
us
i
ordered
mackenzie
off
but
he
would
not
budge
until
saunders
and
parkes
between
them
helped
me
up
behind
the
what
a
relief
it
was
to
feel
the
ground
slipping
past
and
to
know
we
were
getting
out
of
such
a
desperate
scrape
the
boer
fire
had
slackened
for
a
little
but
the
reason
was
that
they
had
mounted
and
galloped
up
to
within
close
range
again
they
opened
and
once
more
the
ground
all
around
was
dusted
up
and
the
air
alive
with
singing
bullets
it
was
too
much
to
hope
for
escape
a
second
time
and
sure
enough
before
we
had
gone
a
hundred
yards
the
gallant
gee
with
his
double
load
fell
heavily
to
earth
a
bullet
having
struck
him
being
perched
high
up
i
reached
the
ground
first
with
a
thud
i
hope
never
to
experience
again
saunders
then
fell
on
top
of
me
and
the
horse
crashed
heavily
across
both
of
us
kicking
me
on
the
shoulder
as
he
rolled
over
illustration
parkes
i
must
have
been
stunned
for
a
moment
but
soon
recovered
my
senses
and
realised
that
i
had
broken
nothing
nor
been
hit
by
a
bullet
saunders
lay
very
still
within
ten
feet
of
me
and
i
feared
he
was
dead
but
cautious
inquiry
elicited
a
reply
he
was
all
right
but
complained
of
being
unable
to
move
one
arm
and
we
assumed
it
was
broken
all
this
time
the
firing
continued
evidently
directed
at
our
retreating
section
judge
of
my
astonishment
on
looking
up
to
see
why
it
should
suddenly
have
increased
in
our
immediate
neighbourhood
to
observe
parkes
riding
back
to
us
he
had
pulled
up
as
quickly
as
he
could
when
he
noticed
our
disaster
seeing
saunders
lying
quiet
he
offered
to
take
me
on
his
horse
but
i
shouted
to
him
to
clear
off
as
he
was
endangering
his
own
life
as
well
as
drawing
the
fire
on
us
i
could
not
have
left
saunders
after
his
having
stopped
to
take
me
up
and
for
parkes
and
myself
to
have
helped
him
away
in
the
midst
of
such
a
murderous
fire
would
have
been
folly
very
reluctantly
parkes
galloped
off
his
horse
shortly
afterwards
was
shot
under
him
but
he
managed
to
get
away
by
running
as
for
myself
i
was
so
shaken
i
could
not
have
gone
far
on
foot
besides
which
i
was
already
exhausted
by
running
in
any
case
to
have
got
up
and
attempted
escape
with
the
enemy
in
such
force
and
at
such
close
range
would
have
been
madness
i
accordingly
lay
very
still
and
called
to
saunders
to
do
likewise
immediately
afterwards
a
party
of
boers
some
strong
swept
past
us
on
horseback
evidently
in
pursuit
of
our
retiring
troops
and
then
began
a
very
trying
part
of
our
experience
the
boers
were
some
hundreds
of
yards
in
front
lying
on
the
face
of
a
slope
and
we
got
the
full
benefit
of
a
very
hot
fire
directed
against
them
three
shells
from
our
own
guns
burst
all
around
and
the
fire
of
a
sighted
a
little
too
high
tore
up
the
ground
close
on
our
left
bullets
fell
all
around
us
and
between
us
so
embarrassing
was
the
situation
that
i
began
to
look
about
for
cover
but
turning
round
i
saw
a
boer
some
hundred
yards
away
steadily
looking
at
us
from
under
the
lee
of
a
rock
whenever
he
saw
me
turn
he
dropped
on
to
his
knee
and
levelled
his
rifle
quickly
i
lay
like
one
dead
and
whispered
hoarsely
to
saunders
not
to
move
for
his
life
it
was
an
anxious
wait
no
bullet
came
and
the
boer
seeing
us
remain
still
stole
cautiously
up
to
where
he
could
see
our
faces
realising
we
were
helpless
he
dropped
his
rifle
and
came
up
assuring
us
he
would
not
harm
us
he
rolled
saunders
round
took
a
valuable
set
of
glasses
from
him
as
well
as
belt
purse
knife
and
everything
worth
having
he
was
about
to
commence
operations
on
me
and
i
was
wondering
if
it
would
be
worth
while
to
make
a
dash
for
his
rifle
when
he
got
up
and
cleared
off
the
cause
was
the
approach
of
a
boer
doctor
who
came
up
and
most
kindly
inquired
if
we
were
wounded
finding
nothing
seriously
the
matter
with
us
he
explained
that
he
must
move
on
to
more
dangerous
cases
but
promised
to
come
back
and
attend
to
us
later
on
then
a
large
party
of
boers
suddenly
surrounded
us
they
stripped
me
of
my
belt
to
which
was
attached
a
fine
knife
and
a
good
compass
also
bandolier
ammunition
and
the
latter
evidently
a
much
appreciated
prize
i
begged
to
have
my
knife
back
as
it
was
a
present
from
a
dear
friend
to
my
astonishment
it
was
handed
back
to
me
then
one
offered
to
buy
it
but
was
quashed
by
the
others
who
said
it
was
a
shame
to
want
from
me
what
i
valued
so
much
then
we
were
helped
up
and
marched
off
towards
the
ambulance
saunders
suffering
considerably
from
his
arm
i
feeling
sound
enough
but
very
sick
and
giddy
round
the
ambulance
cart
was
a
large
crowd
of
boers
evidently
enjoying
the
shelter
of
the
red
cross
they
looked
curiously
at
us
and
the
bolder
asked
for
our
spurs
and
badges
we
parted
with
these
but
protested
at
a
request
to
give
up
our
leathern
gaiters
a
doctor
bound
up
arm
and
we
were
sent
off
in
charge
of
three
guards
to
the
boer
laager
which
lay
over
the
hill
to
the
north
after
a
bit
one
of
the
boers
observing
me
to
move
very
groggily
put
me
on
his
horse
but
saunders
though
his
arm
pained
him
a
good
deal
had
to
walk
in
their
first
fight
and
on
many
occasions
afterwards
horse
bore
testimony
to
the
sportsmanlike
qualities
and
humanity
of
their
enemies
especially
towards
men
who
were
lying
wounded
and
helpless
on
the
field
writing
many
months
afterwards
colonel
lumsden
gave
some
affecting
instances
by
way
of
illustration
and
several
of
these
were
connected
with
the
affair
at
houtnek
though
their
interesting
sequels
were
not
known
in
some
cases
until
near
the
close
of
the
campaign
these
may
be
given
in
colonel
words
he
writes
touch
of
nature
makes
the
whole
world
many
kindly
actions
on
the
part
of
the
boers
have
gone
unrecorded
in
the
present
campaign
i
can
not
however
allow
one
or
two
which
came
under
my
special
notice
to
pass
without
mention
on
april
when
we
were
engaged
with
that
clever
general
de
la
rey
my
scouts
while
reconnoitring
under
lieutenant
pugh
far
in
advance
of
the
main
body
came
suddenly
upon
a
boer
outpost
who
opened
fire
on
them
wounding
poor
franks
severely
pugh
stuck
to
him
gallantly
making
for
where
he
considered
our
leading
column
would
be
franks
however
got
so
weak
that
lieutenant
pugh
and
the
other
two
scouts
had
to
dismount
him
and
leave
him
on
the
veldt
later
in
the
day
when
the
fire
slackened
some
friends
of
franks
were
able
to
go
out
and
carry
him
in
and
place
him
in
the
hands
of
powell
who
did
all
that
was
possible
for
him
in
the
circumstances
we
were
holding
an
untenable
position
and
when
the
order
came
to
retire
early
in
the
afternoon
poor
franks
had
to
be
left
until
an
ambulance
might
be
got
to
carry
him
back
to
our
headquarters
camp
at
spytfontein
shortly
after
our
retirement
from
the
spot
where
he
lay
the
boers
occupied
the
ground
we
had
left
and
finding
franks
treated
him
with
every
kindness
and
attention
it
was
the
last
we
saw
of
him
some
five
days
later
at
the
fight
near
brandfort
a
boer
ambulance
containing
several
wounded
boers
and
with
doctor
everard
in
charge
fell
into
our
hands
on
my
riding
up
to
interview
the
latter
he
asked
if
we
were
not
horse
and
on
my
replying
in
the
affirmative
he
said
of
your
men
named
franks
fell
into
our
hands
on
april
and
was
under
my
care
i
did
all
i
could
for
him
but
the
poor
fellow
then
producing
a
small
from
his
pocket
he
said
this
i
have
noted
when
and
where
he
was
buried
i
also
found
on
his
person
two
sovereigns
and
two
these
the
doctor
handed
to
me
with
a
request
that
i
would
be
good
enough
to
forward
them
to
the
mother
i
thanked
him
most
gratefully
for
what
he
had
done
on
behalf
of
my
late
comrade
and
in
due
course
was
able
to
forward
through
trooper
preston
the
relics
handed
to
me
to
franks
of
the
chase
clapham
common
london
on
the
same
day
april
lieutenant
crane
with
a
small
detachment
of
my
corps
was
sent
by
colonel
ross
our
commanding
officer
to
occupy
a
kopje
on
our
left
front
they
were
attacked
by
an
overwhelming
number
of
the
enemy
and
nearly
the
whole
of
the
little
lot
were
either
killed
wounded
or
taken
prisoners
as
they
maintained
their
position
to
the
last
lieutenant
crane
himself
being
badly
shot
in
the
groin
was
lying
in
an
exposed
position
unseen
by
us
and
under
fire
of
our
own
maxim
gun
which
was
playing
on
the
kopje
now
occupied
by
the
boers
and
in
imminent
risk
of
being
killed
by
our
own
fire
suddenly
one
of
the
boers
came
forward
amidst
a
hail
of
bullets
lifted
up
lieutenant
crane
and
carried
him
to
a
place
of
safety
many
a
has
been
gained
by
doing
a
similar
action
this
story
was
subsequently
corroborated
by
lieutenant
crane
who
told
me
that
the
man
who
behaved
so
gallantly
towards
him
was
named
meyers
strange
to
relate
in
the
following
september
when
that
ideal
cavalry
leader
general
french
made
his
brilliant
dash
on
feature
of
the
campaign
on
which
i
think
too
little
has
been
said
and
not
sufficient
credit
given
to
the
leadership
and
pluck
of
the
gallant
horse
comprised
his
rearguard
under
the
command
of
general
mahon
of
mafeking
fame
as
we
rode
up
the
heights
prior
to
following
general
force
into
the
barberton
valley
we
came
across
several
boer
families
living
in
tents
and
grazing
their
cattle
on
the
veldt
i
rode
up
to
one
of
the
tents
and
was
chatting
with
a
stalwart
boer
and
his
family
he
immediately
spotted
what
corps
we
were
and
said
we
fought
against
you
at
i
asked
his
name
and
he
said
meyers
i
then
shook
hands
with
him
gratefully
and
said
are
the
man
who
carried
my
subaltern
crane
at
the
risk
of
your
life
into
a
place
of
safety
on
that
he
brought
me
a
cup
of
coffee
and
while
i
was
chatting
pleasantly
with
his
wife
and
family
he
said
you
got
a
man
with
you
of
the
name
of
mcgillivray
i
remember
him
well
a
big
scotchman
we
took
him
prisoner
that
day
and
on
our
way
to
pretoria
i
had
the
pleasure
of
dividing
a
couple
of
bottles
of
whisky
between
him
and
one
or
two
of
his
comrades
also
in
our
as
this
boer
was
living
quietly
on
the
veldt
and
not
in
the
fighting
line
i
had
the
pleasure
of
getting
a
pass
for
himself
and
his
family
by
way
of
showing
some
practical
gratitude
for
his
kind
and
plucky
treatment
of
my
comrades

of
to
be
carried
off
captive
after
the
first
hot
skirmish
into
which
one
has
gone
full
of
confidence
and
hope
is
a
trying
experience
for
any
soldier
and
especially
for
those
who
are
conscious
of
having
done
manful
deeds
deserving
a
better
fate
in
these
circumstances
however
it
implies
no
humiliation
but
only
a
feeling
of
rebellious
resentment
against
the
fortunes
of
war
that
have
at
one
fell
stroke
swept
away
all
hopes
of
further
distinction
dashed
every
ambitious
plan
and
severed
for
a
time
at

all
pleasant
associations
with
comrades
whose
friendship
is
never
so
truly
appreciated
under
other
conditions
as
it
is
amid
the
rough
campaigning
experiences
that
try
the
temper
and
the
mettle
of
all
men
the
full
sense
of
everything
that
has
been
lost
comes
upon
in
the
first
hours
of
their
captivity
with
the
crushing
force
of
a
hopeless
defeat
so
that
they
can
not
even
find
it
in
their
hearts
to
be
thankful
for
the
lives
that
have
been
spared
to
them
if
this
is
so
in
the
case
of
men
to
whom
loss
of
liberty
means
no
reproach
and
who
have
the
proud
consciousness
that
they
did
not
purchase
safety
by
unfaithfulness
to
their
trust
how
much
sharper
must
the
sting
be
to
those
who
by
pusillanimous
surrender
have
brought
the
dark
shadow
of
dishonour
on
themselves
and
stained
the
proud
blazonry
of
regimental
distinctions
happily
british
soldiers
have
not
often
gone
into
captivity
with
that
stigma
resting
on
them
and
though
critics
at
home
were
ungenerously
prone
to
assume
that
the
of
had
been
hoisted
too
readily
in
some
fights
against
the
boers
they
would
have
told
a
different
story
if
it
had
been
their
lot
to
lie
on
the
bare
veldt
within
of
hidden
enemies
under
whose
deadly
fire
it
is
even
more
dangerous
to
go
back
than
to
go
forward

idea
of
wresting
victory
by
a
rush
or
wriggling
up
to
it
through
zone
after
zone
of
hailing
bullets
across
four
or
five
hundred
yards
of
open
ground
could
only
have
commended
itself
to
tacticians
comfortably
ensconced
in
far
from
the
buzz
and
boom
of
war
hemmed
in
by
a
girdle
of
fire
that
can
not
possibly
be
broken
by
a
charge
across
such
distances
men
must
either
lie
down
like
sheep
to
be
slaughtered
or
walk
to
their
deaths
with
eyes
open
making
useless
sacrifices
or
surrender
and
none
but
a
braggart
who
had
never
been
under
fire
would
dare
to
hurl
the
poisoned
arrows
of
reproach
at
brave
men
upon
whom
the
last
alternative
has
been
forced
every
soldier
knows
how
unjust
is
that
journalistic
phrase
easy
nobody
could
have
written
it
if
he
had
thought
for
a
moment
of
the
bitterness
that
is
in
the
hearts
of
men
who
have
to
yield
under
the
white
flag
yet
it
is
not
necessarily
an
emblem
of
shame
for
all
that
horse
did
not
hoist
it
in
their
direst
extremity
but
they
would
be
the
last
to
jeer
at
men
who
have
passed
through
such
an
ordeal
if
ever
captives
had
the
right
to
hold
up
their
heads
in
the
presence
of
triumphant
enemies
those
men
were
the
troopers
of
horse
who
had
sacrificed
themselves
rather
than
abandon
a
wounded
comrade

of
them

may
you
will
by
this
time
have
seen
that
i
am
now
a
prisoner
of
war
from
the
published
lists
in
the
papers
i
will
just
give
you
an
outline
of
what
happened
on
the
ult
an
officer
two
officers
and
eleven
men
were
told
off
to
hold
a
hill
as
a
guard
against
an
attack
on
the
right
of
a
body
advancing
from
our
centre
this
centre
body
had
to
retire
and
we
receiving
no
orders
held
on
as
long
as
possible
until
forced
to
retire
which
we
did
having
five
killed
our
officer
wounded
and
four
taken
prisoners
leaving
only
four
who
escaped
to
tell
the
tale
i
could
have
got
away
only
went
back
to
the
assistance
of
our
officer
who
was
wounded
about
ten
yards
behind
me
i
bound
him
up
under
a
heavy
fire
and
providence
must
have
watched
over
me
that
day
as
bullets
in
hundreds
were
flying
all
round
me
i
am
in
good
health
and
received
very
kind
treatment
from
the
hands
of
my
captors
of
which
i
will
write
more
on
another
occasion
as
i
am
not
yet
settled
down
in
my
new
surroundings
how
he
and
his
fared
after
they
had
fallen
into
the
power
of
their
enemies
is
a
story
told
with
graphic
picturesqueness
in
the
following
letters
from
sergeant
fraser
who
was
surrounded
by
boers
when
he
lay
bruised
by
a
heavy
fall
in
company
with
trooper
saunders
who
had
gallantly
risked
his
own
life
in
an
attempt
to
bring
fraser
out
from
under
fire
illustration
johnston
and
sergeant
david
fraser
we
had
imagined
that
our
destination
was
comparatively
close
but
we
covered
mile
after
mile
without
any
more
satisfaction
from
our
guards
than
that
it
was
over
the
next
kopje
the
column
wound
in
and
out
among
many
hills
ere
a
halt
was
called
though
we
had
started
about
in
the
morning
it
was
not
until
in
the
afternoon
that
our
escort
stopped
at
an
ambulance
tent
which
was
in
charge
of
a
hospitable
swiss
doctor
we
had
had
nothing
to
eat
all
day
in
the
hurry
of
getting
ready
so
early
in
the
morning
neither
of
us
had
time
to
think
of
food
and
our
rations
were
in
our
saddles
now
in
the
hands
of
the
boers
so
the
good
swiss
fed
us
plentifully
with
soup
meat
and
coffee
he
examined
me
and
found
only
bruises
arm
was
much
swollen
and
the
surgeon
could
not
ascertain
what
the
damage
was
it
afterwards
turned
out
that
the
muscles
were
lacerated
and
one
of
the
bones
in
the
forearm
cracked
in
the
tent
was
a
wounded
officer
lieutenant
and
adjutant
lilley
of
the
victorian
mounted
rifles
he
poor
chap
had
been
shot
through
the
head
during
the
same
engagement
and
had
been
brought
in
a
waggon
from
the
field
he
recognised
us
in
so
far
as
to
repeat
the
name
of
our
regiment
but
seemed
woefully
wounded
and
repeatedly
broke
out
in
delirium
the
doctor
who
had
been
so
kind
to
us
seemed
assiduous
in
his
attentions
and
i
am
sure
everything
possible
was
done
for
the
poor
australian
we
heard
afterwards
that
he
had
been
left
in
hospital
at
brandfort
by
the
boers
and
found
by
our
troops
a
few
days
afterwards
when
they
took
possession
of
that
place
he
subsequently
died
from
the
wound
which
was
caused
by
a
bullet
passing
through
his
brain
marching
for
another
mile
we
came
to
the
boer
laager
at
dusk
those
in
camp
met
us
kindly
more
particularly
as
the
news
given
by
our
guards
was
that
their
own
commando
had
apparently
scored
a
victory
they
gave
us
coffee
at
once
and
a
place
to
lie
down
and
rest
and
thus
began
our
captivity
while
saunders
and
myself
were
recovering
from
our
exertions
discussing
the
events
of
the
day
and
generally
commiserating
each
other
upon
our
misfortunes
we
were
much
cheered
to
perceive
the
approach
of
two
men
attired
in
khaki
and
helmets
these
proved
to
be
healy
of
the
victorian
rifles
and
private
simmons
of
the
duke
of
mounted
infantry
both
had
fearful
things
to
relate
of
the
action
they
had
been
through
all
the
heavy
fighting
preceding
the
occupation
of
bloemfontein
and
agreed
that
never
had
they
experienced
such
hot
fire
as
on
this
particular
morning
about
our
guards
supplied
us
with
bread
and
coffee
and
pieces
of
biltong
stuck
on
a
wire
that
had
been
thrust
into
a
fire
they
then
accommodated
us
with
a
tent
a
blanket
apiece
and
an
empty
sack
or
we
had
no
coats
and
the
cold
was
intense
in
such
comfort
as
we
could
make
for
ourselves
with
these
limited
resources
we
lay
down
and
soon
slept
the
sleep
of
the
weary
it
seemed
but
a
few
minutes
since
we
had
turned
in
when
we
were
awakened
with
rough
kindliness
and
turned
out
of
our
tent
the
bulk
of
the
commando
had
returned
to
camp
after
a
successful
but
wearisome
day
and
the
owners
of
the
tent
wanted
their
own
so
out
we
got
into
the
bitter
cold
they
placed
us
between
two
tents
and
we
arranged
ourselves
a
second
time
as
best
we
could
despite
the
lack
of
warmth
and
comfort
we
slept
heavily
and
the
sun
was
high
in
the
heavens
next
morning
ere
we
awoke
bread
and
coffee
formed
our
breakfast
and
this
meagre
meal
was
welcome
enough
our
guards
themselves
had
no
more
so
we
could
not
complain
as
the
morning
wore
on
the
sun
became
rather
trying
and
once
again
we
were
accommodated
with
a
tent
wherein
we
discussed
at
length
the
events
of
yesterday
as
this
conversation
turned
inevitably
to
our
own
capture
needless
to
say
we
gradually
began
to
despond
but
we
were
shortly
to
have
our
hearts
lightened
by
the
discovery
of
fellow
company
in
trouble
eases
one
in
marched
firth
mcgillivray
macdonald
petersen
and
williams
of
our
own
corps
followed
by
coghlan
of
regiment
coghlan
had
a
broken
leg
done
up
in
plaster
of
paris
and
lay
on
an
ambulance
pallet
needless
to
say
we
had
much
to
tell
each
other
and
saunders
and
myself
then
heard
how
franks
case
daubney
and
lumsden
had
been
killed
and
lieutenant
crane
wounded
and
a
prisoner
it
was
not
until
afterwards
we
heard
that
major
showers
had
been
killed
and
several
others
wounded
on
the
same
day
the
frugal
fare
of
the
morning
was
repeated
in
the
afternoon
except
in
the
case
of
the
bread
of
it
the
boers
had
none
but
they
furnished
us
with
a
plentiful
supply
of
a
kind
of
rusk
this
appeared
to
be
simply
broken
bread
dried
in
an
oven
it
made
a
very
good
meal
but
tried
those
of
us
whose
teeth
had
been
somewhat
worn
down
by
eating
in
india
to
march
forth
in
the
morning
with
a
gun
in
your
hand
to
fight
your
battles
to
endanger
your
life
that
you
may
return
to
your
female
relatives
decorated
and
a
hero
to
hear
the
vicious
ping
of
bullets
the
shrieking
of
shells
and
know
yourself
alarmed
but
undismayed
are
fine
things
but
to
sit
at
night
in
the
laager
with
wings
clipped
no
gun
and
a
sinking
stomach
is
so
untoward
a
thing
that
a
man
who
suffers
it
may
well
question
the
reason
of
his
birth
and
entertain
hopes
that
the
world
is
about
to
end
six
of
us
sat
in
the
dusky
light
of
a
tent
in
a
boer
laager
near
brandfort
and
our
own
mothers
could
not
have
comforted
us
it
as
if
we
had
had
a
bellyful
of
fighting
like
others
who
had
begun
the
campaign
in
cape
colony
or
as
if
after
a
tremendous
struggle
we
had
been
overpowered
without
practically
a
chance
to
retaliate
we
had
been
deluged
with
bullets
that
went
by
in
such
numbers
you
could
hear
them
rattle
against
each
other
in
their
flight
then
instead
of
the
bullets
came
the
boers
and
we
were
up
pockets
empty
hopes
vanished
in
our
first
fight
when
night
had
fallen
the
were
two
of
them
with
loaded
rifles
and
us
in
a
big
kettle
in
which
had
been
boiled
water
and
they
said
coffee
one
of
us
sadly
asked
if
they
had
put
in
sugar
as
well
and
on
receiving
a
reply
in
the
affirmative
murmured
good
hot
water
then
we
munched
away
at
rusks
of
which
light
and
tasteless
provender
they
chucked
us
in
a
quantity
in
the
bottom
of
a
sack
and
i
wondered
if
the
nourishment
contained
therein
would
compensate
for
the
energy
expended
in
chewing
them
i
know
i
registered
a
mental
vow
never
to
feed
my
horses
on
bran
alone
if
ever
i
got
back
to
india
a
few
of
us
had
pipes
and
there
was
no
difficulty
about
boer
tobacco
but
here
again
one
was
reminded
of
bran
for
although
the
colour
was
not
quite
the
same
the
taste
was
nearly
identical
with
what
i
imagine
bran
would
give
if
smoked
as
it
grew
late
the
cold
increased
and
by
we
were
shivering
those
of
us
who
had
managed
to
retain
their
greatcoats
were
not
so
badly
off
but
others
who
had
nothing
but
thin
khaki
tunics
suffered
considerably
on
representing
matters
to
the
sentries
they
procured
for
us
a
few
blankets
and
empty
sacks
and
huddled
together
each
man
endeavoured
to
sleep
to
the
chatter
of
his
teeth
the
laager
next
morning
showed
signs
of
great
activity
a
large
patrol
was
about
to
start
in
the
direction
of
the
british
lines
and
the
two
hundred
or
so
composing
this
body
shook
hands
every
man
of
them
with
half
a
dozen
of
their
comrades
who
it
afterwards
turned
out
were
to
form
our
escort
to
pretoria
according
to
our
preconceived
ideas
of
how
troops
should
move
out
of
camp
the
behaviour
of
the
boers
seemed
absurd
no
word
of
command
appeared
to
be
given
but
in
a
moment
the
aspect
of
the
camp
that
had
been
full
of
men
lolling
about
talking
and
skylarking
was
changed
horses
were
saddled
bridled
and
mounted
in
a
matter
of
seconds
the
ceremony
of
gone
through
and
in
less
than
five
minutes
from
the
first
impulse
which
set
them
getting
ready
the
patrol
had
disappeared
over
the
skyline
some
were
trotting
some
cantering
and
there
was
no
attempt
at
formation
but
none
the
less
their
method
or
want
of
it
was
effective
and
one
could
not
help
being
impressed
with
the
individual
independence
of
each
man
combined
as
it
was
with
complete
unanimity
of
object
in
the
whole
body
our
turn
came
next
and
we
made
our
little
preparations
to
start
these
consisted
mostly
of
buttoning
up
and
indeed
there
was
a
charming
sense
of
irresponsibility
in
having
no
arrangements
to
make
no
packing
to
do
no
to
give
for
our
conveyance
was
prepared
a
with
the
appearance
of
which
the
illustrated
papers
have
made
all
the
world
familiar
twelve
mules
were
stuck
in
front
the
driver
cracked
his
whip
and
the
caravan
was
ready
down
the
centre
of
the
waggon
on
a
mattress
and
propped
about
with
blankets
was
placed
the
wounded
victorian
the
rest
of
us
sat
round
with
our
legs
dangling
over
the
side
a
kaffir
held
the
reins
from
a
raised
seat
in
front
and
two
boers
sat
alongside
of
him
with
loaded
rifles
on
their
knees
but
they
had
their
backs
to
the
mules
and
the
points
of
their
guns
towards
poor
us
at
the
tail
end
of
the
waggon
sat
two
more
boers
also
armed
a
fifth
boer
unarmed
barring
a
whip
as
long
as
chowringhi
marched
alongside
to
curse
the
mules
and
pick
holes
in
their
hides
when
the
cursing
failed
as
we
stood
ready
the
boers
near
shook
hands
all
round
with
us
hoped
the
war
would
soon
be
over
and
we
be
back
in
our
ain
countrees
and
themselves
restored
to
the
bosoms
of
their
families
we
moved
off
with
a
jolt
that
made
the
poor
victorian
groan
and
they
shouted
after
us
and
congratulations
that
we
were
going
to
that
wonderful
place
pretoria
soon
a
rising
hid
the
laager
and
around
we
could
see
nothing
but
a
tree
not
a
house
not
a
boer
and
now
we
thought
is
our
chance
we
only
had
to
lay
hold
of
our
guards
by
the
throats
wrest
their
rifles
away
and
so
turn
the
tables
poor
return
for
their
hearty
kindness
but
then
we
did
not
cherish
the
same
feelings
for
pretoria
that
they
did
these
ideas
of
escape
were
rippling
round
cheerfully
but
guardedly
when
our
hopes
flopped
to
the
ground
for
over
the
skyline
came
cantering
a
couple
of
boers
and
we
soon
found
their
business
was
to
trot
behind
we
might
easily
overpower
the
guards
in
the
waggon
but
what
profit
would
there
be
in
that
if
one
mounted
man
galloped
for
assistance
while
the
other
kept
watch
on
our
movements
without
the
mounted
men
we
might
have
bagged
our
guards
and
got
clear
away
as
no
warning
of
our
escape
could
then
have
reached
the
boer
lines
for
at
least
hours
but
it
was
not
to
be
and
we
resigned
ourselves
to
the
inevitable
when
nothing
to
see
almost
as
much
to
eat
and
the
own
pother
to
think
about
travelling
is
wearisome
add
to
these
conditions
a
place
to
sit
upon
as
hard
as
the
heart
of
pharaoh
and
the
gun
to
keep
you
on
it
and
travelling
becomes
unendurable
if
it
for
the
antics
of
brother
boer
we
should
have
succumbed
to
jaundice
occasioned
by
nausea
of
the
situation
or
some
other
fell
disease
but
the
boer
brother
to
beguile
the
tedium
of
the
way
showed
us
a
thing
or
two
in
bullying
in
quarrelling
and
in
last
named
to
our
disappointment
not
being
a
consequence
of
the
first
two
hanging
on
to
a
projection
of
our
waggon
was
an
attendant
to
look
after
the
mules
a
kaffir
boy
about
fifteen
years
old
his
face
was
unadorned
with
beard
whisker
or
moustache
one
of
the
boers
snatched
the
cap
from
him
held
him
tight
by
the
scruff
of
the
neck
and
then
chucked
the
cap
into
the
road
meanwhile
the
waggon
proceeded
and
soon
the
cap
was
a
dim
speck
half
a
mile
behind
then
the
owner
of
the
cap
was
loosed
off
and
away
he
sped
back
to
his
lost
property
when
he
reached
it
we
were
a
clear
mile
away
thereupon
the
boers
waxed
mighty
cheerful
and
the
waggoner
loudly
chuckling
whipped
up
his
mules
into
a
fast
trot
the
little
nigger
running
like
a
good
far
in
the
rear
the
going
was
too
bad
for
continuous
trotting
so
in
two
or
three
miles
the
boy
had
overhauled
us
and
though
very
blown
he
showed
his
teeth
with
pleasure
at
catching
us
apparently
bearing
no
malice
for
the
trick
that
had
been
played
on
him
but
his
troubles
were
not
over
as
he
laid
hold
of
the
waggon
to
jump
on
a
great
boer
hand
was
sprawled
in
his
face
and
he
went
down
on
the
road
like
a
thousand
of
bricks
at
the
unexpected
assault
loud
guffaws
from
the
brethren
greeted
this
performance
it
was
repeated
again
and
again
till
the
poor
devil
was
hopelessly
beaten
and
unable
to
continue
the
game
then
when
allowed
to
hang
on
again
he
had
to
put
up
with
brutal
horseplay
his
ears
were
pulled
his
face
contorted
into
extraordinary
shapes
and
tufts
of
wool
bleeding
jerked
out
of
his
head
at
this
point
we
deemed
it
our
business
to
interfere
and
appealing
to
the
man
who
appeared
to
be
in
command
of
our
guard
and
who
spoke
english
well
we
asked
if
it
was
usual
for
the
boers
to
treat
kaffirs
in
this
way
and
if
so
we
told
him
it
was
high
time
every
boer
in
south
africa
was
shut
up
in
helena
this
touched
him
up
and
he
ordered
the
two
bullies
to
drop
it
then
ensued
a
pretty
quarrel
some
of
us
felt
sure
there
were
hindustani
words
dreadful
they
sounded
in
dutch
mouths
we
fondly
hoped
there
would
be
shooting
or
at
least
fisticuffs
but
the
boer
is
like
the
leviathan
in
words
and
a
mouse
in
deeds
behind
a
stone
his
heart
is
like
that
which
protects
him
and
in
the
open
his
heart
becomes
just
like
the
atmosphere
which
affords
him
no
protection
when
cheerfulness
was
more
or
less
restored
somebody
espied
a
herd
of
buck
about
a
mile
away
the
keen
sight
of
the
boers
is
astonishing
and
the
way
they
detected
the
movements
of
the
buck
at
that
distance
was
a
revelation
some
of
us
could
see
nothing
at
all
but
the
keenest
thought
they
could
spot
a
little
bit
of
colour
which
the
boers
said
was
a
herd
of
about
twenty
buck
in
a
minute
three
of
them
were
blazing
away
with
their
mausers
but
the
herd
cleared
without
casualty
throughout
the
rest
of
the
way
the
boers
blazed
away
without
intermission
at
anything
and
everything
that
suggested
itself
as
a
target
there
certainly
was
no
idea
among
them
then
that
it
would
be
well
to
husband
ammunition
i
see
by
the
papers
that
their
commandants
are
said
to
be
exhorting
the
boers
now
in
the
field
to
save
their
cartridges
for
officers
and
not
to
waste
any
on
the
tommies
but
at
the
date
of
which
i
am
writing
they
behaved
as
if
their
supply
of
ammunition
was
inexhaustible
about
midday
a
halt
was
called
the
niggers
did
something
to
the
harness
which
dropped
on
the
ground
and
the
mules
freed
were
quickly
up
to
their
knees
in
an
adjacent
dam
and
soon
after
that
busily
engaged
with
the
veldt
grass
only
once
a
day
were
they
supposed
to
get
a
feed
of
corn
and
from
all
we
could
hear
that
day
only
came
round
about
once
a
week
in
the
meantime
the
boers
had
fished
out
an
empty
wine
case
smashed
it
up
lighted
a
fire
and
placed
a
great
kettle
on
top
while
that
was
boiling
the
carcass
of
a
sheep
was
produced
from
a
sack
and
all
and
sundry
hacked
a
piece
off
when
the
kettle
had
boiled
and
the
coffee
was
made
the
fire
was
heaped
up
afresh
with
wood
and
every
man
had
his
bit
of
meat
on
the
end
of
a
stick
held
it
in
the
flames
where
it
fizzled
and
cracked
and
spurted
as
merrily
as
any
steak
on
a
grill
in
london
town
there
was
a
dish
of
salt
to
dip
into
when
you
judged
the
cooking
complete
our
rusk
sack
was
still
partially
filled
and
the
dam
full
of
water
within
a
few
yards
of
us
more
could
the
englishman
want
said
brother
boer
as
he
lapped
up
all
the
coffee
in
the
newspapers
the
boer
is
made
to
speak
of
the
but
my
experience
of
the
boer
is
that
he
prefers
pet
adjective
before
all
others
our
rustic
repast
over
the
kaffirs
began
to
collect
the
mules
this
they
did
not
by
running
round
them
but
by
sitting
still
and
emitting
sounds
into
the
tenor
of
which
god
forbid
that
any
civilised
human
being
should
inquire
sufficient
to
say
that
they
were
weird
enough
to
the
mules
into
leaving
their
feed
and
travelling
half
a
mile
to
the
waggon
there
to
be
yoked
again
in
slavery
thereafter
our
journey
was
uneventful
until
we
struck
the
railway
where
we
fondly
hoped
to
find
a
train
but
the
advance
of
the
british
from
bloemfontein
had
begun
and
the
boers
to
prevent
a
sudden
descent
on
the
railway
within
their
own
lines
had
taken
the
precaution
of
blowing
up
every
bridge
and
culvert
for
many
miles
inside
their
own
outposts
so
we
had
to
traverse
six
more
weary
miles
witnessing
for
diversion
the
destruction
that
dynamite
can
bring
upon
the
handiwork
of
man
great
iron
bridges
broken
and
tossed
aside
huge
embankments
shattered
railway
stations
annihilated
cruel
signs
but
the
inevitable
consequences
of
war
at
dark
we
reached
smaldeel
a
little
station
sixty
miles
north
of
bloemfontein
and
at
that
time
the
southernmost
depôt
of
the
boer
forces
on
the
railway
three
days
later
the
british
were
in
possession
of
smaldeel
and
fired
on
the
last
boer
train
steaming
out
of
the
station
but
knowing
that
afterwards
did
not
comfort
us
a
bit
when
they
locked
us
up
that
night
smaldeel
is
not
an
attractive
place
we
were
dumped
down
in
the
most
unattractive
part
of
it
imagine
a
house
built
of
wood
and
corrugated
iron
one
window
per
room
and
each
one
of
them
nailed
down
as
it
had
been
for
a
long
time
imagine
in
one
of
these
rooms
boer
clothes
empties
forgotten
bedding
remember
the
boarded
window
call
for
a
glass
of
brandy
and
think
with
sympathy
of
us
poor
sinners
condemned
to
such
a
place
for
a
livelong
night
what
a
ghastly
night
it
was
they
passed
us
in
a
small
kettleful
of
coffee
that
ran
to
about
half
a
mug
per
man
we
were
dreadfully
thirsty
but
the
only
water
was
a
single
between
the
crowd
of
said
there
was
no
more
available
for
solids
we
had
the
remains
of
the
rusks
on
this
slender
nourishment
we
had
to
recoup
our
jaded
bodies
and
revive
our
flagging
spirits
needless
to
say
in
the
morning
we
looked
and
felt
but
sorry
representatives
of
queen
and
country
at
daylight
we
were
cleared
out
of
that
room
the
taste
of
which
will
remain
with
me
until
the
day
i
die
the
effect
on
us
of
the
cold
clean
air
outside
was
indescribable
we
blew
ourselves
out
with
it
like
pouter
pigeons
and
nearly
dropped
down
from
shock
to
the
system
we
breathed
the
good
air
till
we
forgot
to
be
hungry
thirsty
or
even
ashamed
of
our
lamentable
plight
the
surging
of
it
through
our
corrupted
lungs
was
better
that
would
be
departing
from
the
plain
unvarnished
style
with
which
the
soldier
man
is
allowed
to
embellish
his
narrative
in
lieu
of
literary
grace
we
were
popped
into
a
waiting
train
the
carriages
of
which
for
narrowness
and
hardness
were
like
coffins
without
the
compensating
immunity
from
pain
and
trouble
so
characteristic
of
the
ordinary
coffin
that
we
might
fit
in
easily
they
gave
us
nothing
to
eat
or
drink
and
when
the
train
started
we
rattled
about
our
compartment
like
dried
peas
in
a
drum
to
see
us
off
the
station
was
crowded
with
all
sorts
and
conditions
of
the
human
race
it
was
astonishing
to
realise
that
the
throat
of
man
was
so
constituted
that
it
could
be
used
to
emit
sounds
which
were
nothing
like
anything
we
had
ever
heard
before
i
heard
a
hundred
high
court
chaprassies
hold
the
concert
in
which
their
champion
sang
a
solo
in
so
raucous
a
voice
that
it
caused
the
great
crack
which
now
ornaments
the
calcutta
high
court
building
but
it
was
nothing
to
smaldeel
station
take
a
boer
who
has
lived
on
the
high
veldt
of
the
transvaal
with
his
neighbour
four
miles
off
and
bring
him
into
a
space
where
his
conversation
has
to
carry
for
feet
instead
of
miles
and
you
are
overwhelmed
by
his
voice
three
hundred
of
that
sort
endeavoured
to
hold
converse
with
us
wanting
to
know
where
we
had
come
from
why
we
had
come
and
what
we
thought
of
our
chances
in
the
boer
thinks
anybody
who
has
taken
up
arms
against
the
anointed
people
has
a
chance
of
salvation
we
told
them
as
much
as
we
could
some
of
it
with
regard
to
the
truth
but
mostly
without
they
plainly
said
we
were
liars
when
we
informed
them
we
came
from
india
they
knew
all
about
indian
coolies
so
to
be
taken
in
they
were
of
opinion
that
several
of
us
who
were
were
mere
children
and
deplored
the
sinfulness
of
a
government
that
could
send
such
lambs
to
the
slaughter
the
ones
cordially
concurred
and
ventured
to
hope
the
boer
government
would
do
the
right
thing
and
ship
the
little
pets
straight
away
to
their
mammas
that
was
another
story
said
that
oom
paul
would
know
how
to
deal
equitably
with
pretoria
pretoria
it
was
always
pretoria
as
if
that
ghastly
little
village
was
the
hub
of
the
universe
i
may
be
allowed
here
to
point
out
that
the
dutch
pronunciation
of
the
name
of
the
late
president
of
the
transvaal
differs
slightly
from
that
commonly
used
in
india
of
course
our
indian
way
is
the
soundest
but
it
may
give
this
feeble
narrative
a
touch
of
realism
to
have
included
the
fact
that
in
south
africa
is
pronounced
with
the
accent
on
the
is
pronounced
like
with
a
instead
of
a
the
burgher
general
botha
in
his
native
land
is
called
both
syllables
of
equal
value
and
spoken
rather
our
indian
word
with
which
word
in
fact
rhymes
many
other
words
appertaining
to
south
africa
are
pronounced
not
at
all
in
the
way
that
we
have
accepted
as
fit
and
proper
swears
however
find
boer
and
briton
unanimous
both
in
pronunciation
and
frequency
of
use
when
we
had
left
the
babel
of
smaldeel
far
behind
we
settled
down
to
a
critical
examination
of
the
country
we
were
spinning
through
we
had
to
occupy
ourselves
with
a
subject
of
absorbing
interest
so
as
to
divert
our
minds
from
dwelling
on
the
vacuity
of
that
part
of
our
anatomies
which
it
is
not
considered
polite
to
mention
out
of
a
church
or
a
nursery
but
in
the
matter
of
found
it
consoling
to
see
nothing
but
rolling
downs
with
never
a
kopje
in
sight
right
or
left
nearly
all
the
way
through
the
northern
part
of
the
free
state
surely
bobs
and
his
army
would
waltz
along
such
easy
going
and
speedily
rescue
us
from
the
clutches
of
the
wicked
boer
so
far
as
kroonstad
there
was
nothing
to
stop
the
british
there
a
river
forming
a
deep
spruit
meandered
by
and
would
certainly
give
trouble
were
our
troops
to
confine
themselves
to
a
frontal
attack
but
by
this
time
the
uses
of
flanking
movements
had
been
thoroughly
grasped
by
our
army
and
it
could
only
be
a
question
of
a
day
or
two
for
our
fellows
to
slip
up
on
either
side
and
squeeze
the
enemy
out
steaming
into
kroonstad
it
was
comforting
to
think
what
a
favourable
country
the
british
army
would
have
to
operate
in
but
the
feeling
was
as
naught
compared
with
that
aroused
in
us
when
we
heard
we
were
to
be
fed
at
kroonstad
psychologists
evolve
wonderful
things
from
the
mind
of
the
intellectual
man
but
let
them
starve
him
then
see
how
his
inner
consciousness
changes
its
base
of
operations
thoughts
emanating
from
the
brain
lack
the
vigour
and
inventiveness
of
those
prompted
by
the
working
of
the
more
humble
organ
the
war
in
south
africa
proves
this
conclusively
wherever
our
troops
and
generals
have
been
well
fed
the
tendency
has
been
to
make
a
mull
of
things
but
they
have
never
been
starved
without
doing
grand
work
the
defence
of
ladysmith
the
relief
of
kimberley
the
brilliant
marches
of
lord
army
where
for
days
on
end
whole
divisions
had
nothing
but
a
biscuit
or
two
to
crunch
per
man
we
rushed
into
kroonstad
station
with
the
familiar
feeling
of
dashing
importance
that
everybody
knows
about
who
travels
by
rail
we
pulled
up
with
the
old
jerk
only
more
so
that
we
so
joyously
used
to
anticipate
when
children
we
sniffed
the
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
coloured
papers
in
the
bookstall
and
everything
seemed
just
the
same
as
in
old
if
we
were
only
waking
up
to
pleasant
reality
after
a
horrid
dream
but
when
we
tried
to
get
out
the
grimness
of
the
truth
was
brought
home
to
us
loaded
rifles
barred
our
way
however
the
grub
came
and
our
sorrows
were
forgotten
in
the
pleasure
of
exercising
our
fast
stiffening
jaws
it
was
great
sandwiches
of
bully
beef
no
butter
no
trimmings
but
mighty
good
and
bowls
of
steaming
coffee
there
was
a
fair
whack
for
each
man
and
none
of
us
thought
of
giving
half
to
the
poor
or
saving
up
any
for
a
rainy
day
every
man
ate
up
all
he
got
and
never
emitted
a
sound
other
than
that
of
mastication
until
the
grunt
of
interrogation
which
denoted
finished
and
was
there
any
more
there
and
we
got
no
more
that
day
barring
what
we
bought
and
paid
for
at
extortionate
rates
at
any
game
in
the
world
the
briton
can
beat
the
boer
if
the
conditions
are
such
that
the
briton
has
any
chance
at
all
this
may
seem
a
reckless
statement
in
view
of
the
fact
that
boers
are
still
holding
the
field
against
ten
times
their
number
but
i
make
it
with
a
knowledge
of
the
circumstances
and
am
willing
to
demonstrate
the
truth
of
my
statement
to
any
unbeliever
who
has
the
pluck
to
call
on
me
expressing
his
doubt
at
any
rate
by
night
time
when
we
crossed
the
vaal
river
and
had
reached
vereeniging
the
first
station
in
the
transvaal
we
had
so
our
guards
into
a
belief
in
our
desire
to
reach
pretoria
that
they
trusted
us
on
to
the
platform
from
which
we
gravitated
into
the
with
a
celerity
that
would
have
astonished
sir
isaac
newton
we
found
it
crowded
with
people
who
seem
to
think
we
were
particularly
any
rate
they
did
not
offer
us
drinks
these
we
had
to
pay
for
at
the
rate
of
a
enough
considering
everything
eggs
each
sandwiches
cigars
none
under
the
we
could
not
run
to
so
set
about
looking
for
pipes
and
boer
tobacco
is
sold
in
glazed
paper
bags
about
the
size
of
lb
of
sugar
for
a
time
you
can
use
it
either
for
smoking
or
as
bedding
for
horses
and
eat
it
pipes
like
those
you
get
at
home
for
were
half
a
crown
so
there
is
no
need
to
dissert
on
the
fiscal
methods
of
the
boer
no
free
trade
about
him
he
represents
mckinley
at
about
two
stone
in
the
matter
of
protection
i
coveted
a
pipe
for
and
told
the
barman
i
was
very
sorry
i
only
had
and
he
give
it
to
a
poor
prisoner
at
a
reduction
it
was
true
about
the
for
i
was
afraid
to
produce
a
sovereign
lest
some
of
them
should
take
a
fancy
to
it
as
they
had
done
to
so
many
of
our
little
valuables
the
beast
said
see
me
damned
first
and
i
called
him
something
in
hindustani
which
attracted
more
attention
than
i
liked
when
i
felt
a
hand
twitching
my
tunic
and
saw
a
little
jew
man
winking
portentously
i
put
my
hand
down
and
he
slipped
a
coin
into
shilling
it
was
to
enable
me
buy
the
pipe
this
is
one
of
the
few
sporting
things
i
have
seen
done
in
the
transvaal
and
it
was
not
a
boer
who
did
it
i
think
boers
understand
sport
they
never
do
anything
until
they
have
got
six
to
four
the
best
of
their
neighbour
every
boer
who
plays
billiards
carries
a
bit
of
soap
and
the
few
that
are
not
afraid
to
play
football
are
adepts
at
tripping
they
have
stopped
playing
cards
entirely
for
they
invariably
found
after
a
few
hands
were
dealt
in
a
game
that
nothing
but
the
rags
of
the
pack
remained
to
be
played
with
all
the
good
cards
having
gone
up
the
sleeves
of
the
players
however
i
bought
the
pipe
and
refunded
the
kindly
little
jew
his
bob
leaving
the
bar
i
passed
a
little
bunch
of
boers
who
had
rather
enjoyed
my
rebuff
at
the
hands
of
the
barman
i
gravely
congratulated
the
boers
on
their
brother
behind
the
bar
and
asked
if
they
had
many
other
boers
as
good
looking
discretion
may
sometimes
be
a
branch
of
valour
but
there
was
very
little
valour
about
the
discretion
i
exercised
when
i
left
that
the
rest
of
the
night
in
the
train
was
tedious
and
uncomfortable
to
a
degree
and
cold
beyond
words
at
or
in
the
morning
we
landed
at
pretoria
and
our
guards
all
south
african
republic
hated
to
pretoria
instead
of
leaving
us
in
the
train
until
daylight
hauled
us
out
and
marched
us
off
after
a
mile
or
so
we
came
to
a
building
we
entered
by
a
gate
and
found
ourselves
in
a
courtyard
with
high
walls
we
were
there
delivered
over
to
another
lot
of
ruffians
the
first
lot
clearing
off
to
their
homes
in
high
jubilation
at
the
prospect
of
rejoining
wives
and
families
after
many
months
in
the
field
they
had
not
been
unkind
to
us
on
the
whole
and
we
found
them
simple
enough
but
imbued
with
considerable
contempt
of
the
britisher
and
an
unchangeable
belief
in
the
ultimate
success
of
their
own
cause
sitting
on
the
cold
stone
pavement
of
the
courtyard
chewing
the
cud
of
our
misfortunes
we
waited
for
the
only
friend
sun
meanwhile
strange
sounds
came
from
the
high
walls
surrounding
sighs
deep
gruntings
weird
moanings
harsh
cries
and
loud
beatings
we
wondered
what
manner
of
place
we
were
in
daylight
revealed
the
truth
we
were
in
the
pretoria
gaol
and
all
around
us
were
the
drunks
and
incapables
the
vagrants
and
vagabonds
black
and
white
that
had
been
scraped
out
of
the
gutter
the
night
before
mostly
they
were
kaffir
unwieldy
hideously
ugly
creatures
reminding
one
of
those
depicted
by
hogarth
in
his
scenes
of
low
life
in
london
nearly
two
centuries
ago
when
the
sun
rose
the
doors
of
the
cells
were
opened
and
we
saw
strange
sights
the
gaoler
prodded
the
sulky
ones
with
a
long
stick
and
made
them
come
out
standing
about
in
the
fresh
morning
light
dirty
frowzled
altogether
abominable
to
look
at
they
seemed
a
blot
on
creation
and
the
knowledge
of
their
mere
existence
hung
heavily
on
mind
it
was
not
a
pleasant
awakening
to
the
splendours
of
the
boer
capital
for
about
the
tenth
time
we
gave
in
our
full
names
and
all
we
could
think
of
in
the
way
of
description
down
to
red
hair
for
which
the
boer
has
a
peculiar
regard
a
boer
with
red
hair
can
be
a
mormon
a
dozen
times
nearly
all
their
clergymen
have
red
hair
in
among
the
drunks
and
incapables
we
found
one
cell
containing
representatives
of
the
british
army
lately
free
fighting
men
but
now
confined
against
their
own
wishes
one
of
these
to
my
his
appearance
did
not
suggest
the
soldier
in
the
very
me
by
name
and
i
recognised
in
him
a
saddler
sergeant
who
had
built
me
a
very
excellent
saddle
some
years
before
when
his
regiment
the
hussars
was
in
india
he
and
a
pal
had
been
taken
prisoners
at
the
very
beginning
of
the
war
in
natal
and
so
had
done
six
months
in
durance
vile
they
had
been
so
bored
with
their
experiences
that
they
had
escaped
and
endeavoured
to
get
to
portuguese
territory
but
unluckily
the
ubiquitous
boer
had
been
too
many
for
them
and
they
were
now
being
restored
to
their
quo
as
political
paragraphists
describe
it
another
was
a
yeoman
lad
from
county
notts
with
a
very
much
worn
pair
of
boots
to
his
feet
and
it
showed
fine
public
spirit
in
him
that
he
seemed
to
deplore
this
fact
more
than
his
being
made
prisoner
in
the
corner
of
the
courtyard
was
a
tap
and
we
all
did
a
bit
of
washing
the
absence
of
ebony
soap
was
rather
a
drawback
but
it
did
not
prevent
us
creating
at
least
a
zone
of
cleanliness
we
were
then
paraded
and
in
as
martial
array
as
was
possible
without
guns
or
swords
and
incommoded
with
blankets
and
empty
sacks
we
marched
forth
with
a
loud
cheer
to
be
a
prisoner
of
war
was
a
fate
that
might
overcome
the
best
soldier
that
ever
stepped
but
to
be
herded
with
police
injured
the
dignity
of
every
one
of
us
walk
past
cottages
shops
where
smiling
lassies
stood
at
doorways
and
all
the
signs
of
a
little
country
town
at
home
we
came
to
a
great
enclosed
space
at
one
corner
of
which
was
inscribed
the
legend
we
immediately
began
arguing
about
who
was
to
play
in
the
first
chukker
and
whether
have
a
chukker
with
a
change
of
pony
or
chukkers
of
six
minutes
straight
away
two
known
cracks
were
agreed
upon
and
they
to
save
unseemly
fighting
picked
up
sides
then
each
side
began
backing
itself
for
large
sums
on
the
nod
while
the
unselected
ones
scoffed
and
offered
to
against
either
team
needless
to
say
while
diverting
ourselves
in
this
manner
we
were
girt
about
by
armed
horsemen
who
conducted
themselves
with
much
dignity
and
secret
spurrings
especially
when
passing
where
comely
lassies
stood
at
the
doors
in
this
respect
i
have
observed
the
boer
does
not
differ
from
the
briton
nor
has
he
any
scruples
about
endeavouring
to
attract
the
admiration
of
another
girl
as
well
as
his
own
marching
along
one
side
of
the
enclosure
we
came
to
a
great
entrance
and
realised
of
a
sudden
that
we
had
arrived
at
the
racecourse
rendered
classic
by
the
experiences
of
our
imprisoned
troops
within
its
gates
we
entered
and
found
all
the
offices
so
familiar
to
stand
paddock
room
no
equine
wonders
it
filled
our
hearts
with
sorrow
to
see
such
even
a
booky
to
trill
forth
the
odds
but
there
was
a
desolation
over
the
scene
very
different
from
the
stir
and
bustle
of
a
racecourse
our
troops
had
been
penned
up
in
a
enclosure
that
included
the
paddock
stands
and
a
bit
of
the
course
itself
most
of
the
buildings
had
been
utilised
as
hospitals
and
where
or
how
the
poor
devils
who
enteric
or
dysentery
or
pleurisy
or
rheumatic
fever
existed
heaven
alone
knows
the
had
the
privilege
of
sleeping
on
the
steps
of
the
grand
stand
and
i
suppose
the
others
had
to
be
content
with
the
ground
very
quickly
the
accommodation
at
the
racecourse
had
become
inadequate
and
the
camp
at
waterval
was
established
leaving
only
a
hospital
and
a
staff
of
orderlies
the
result
was
a
most
woebegone
place
littered
with
empty
tins
rags
paper
and
refuse
of
all
sorts
we
elected
to
occupy
a
row
of
facing
the
paddock
sure
no
owner
of
racehorses
would
have
allowed
any
of
his
string
to
enter
these
boxes
but
we
were
only
too
glad
to
find
a
place
wherein
to
lay
our
heads
after
a
long
delay
they
brought
us
rations
of
potatoes
i
remember
well
being
little
round
things
about
the
size
of
marbles
and
everyone
gaily
sprouting
for
the
rest
we
had
lb
of
meat
and
a
loaf
of
bread
apiece
plenty
of
cold
water
and
the
consolation
of
being
told
we
had
a
great
deal
to
be
thankful
for
while
our
troops
had
been
confined
at
the
racecourse
some
of
the
residents
of
pretoria
had
been
exceedingly
kind
in
supplying
them
with
what
to
them
were
great
luxuries
to
help
out
the
meagre
fare
allowed
by
the
boer
government
a
but
sticky
delicacy
was
a
considerable
supply
of
golden
syrup
in
one
little
hut
occupied
by
a
mess
of
sergeants
twelve
men
used
to
sleep
every
night
packed
as
close
as
herrings
the
morning
following
the
day
on
which
they
had
received
their
share
of
the
golden
syrup
they
found
themselves
all
stuck
together
and
had
to
rise
up
in
one
piece
like
a
row
of
toy
soldiers
lieutenant
crane
was
taken
off
to
the
newly
formed
camp
for
prisoners
on
a
barren
hillside
north
of
pretoria
where
nearly
all
officers
had
been
confined
within
triple
fences
of
barbed
wire
since
their
removal
from
the
model
school
officers
and
troopers
of
horse
had
to
share
the
fate
of
other
captive
soldiers
at
waterval
on
the
high
veldt
outside
the
magaliesberg
but
luckily
they
were
not
among
the
number
hurried
away
by
retreating
boer
commandos
to
distant
nooitgedacht
when
our
troops
entered
pretoria
at
waterval
the
daily
rations
were
scanty
enough
though
luxurious
by
comparison
with
the
meagre
fare
served
out
at
a
later
date
to
prisoners
in
that
place
away
eastwards
with
a
name
that
bespeaks
desolation
and

the
kindness
of
the
american
consul
sergeant
fraser
was
able
to
obtain
funds
from
india
for
himself
and
his
this
enabled
them
to
supplement
the
rough
rations
issued
to
them
during
their
imprisonment
at
waterval
to
cover
the
advances
made
for
this
purpose
colonel
lumsden
authorised
a
grant
of
each
to
the
prisoners
being
at
the
rate
of
per
man
per
week
for
the
period
of
their
captivity
thus
the
value
of
such
a
fund
as
had
been
raised
in
calcutta
before
the
corps
left
was
demonstrated
in
an
unforeseen
way
by
means
of
it
colonel
lumsden
had
been
able
to
start
with
a
of

a
sufficient
credit

illustration
waterval
prison
near

of
the
uneventful
dulness
of
their
life
in
the
camp
where
few
visitors
ever
came
and
none
whose
presence
could
be
considered
very
cheerful
we
may
judge
by
the
fact
that
hardly
anything
has
been
written
about
it
the
poor
fellows
who
had
neither
money
nor
friends
to
procure
it
for
them
must
have
fared
ill
indeed
on
nothing
but
government
rations
issued
according
to
the
following
scale
which
can
not
be
impugned
seeing
that
the
editor
found
it
written
in
choicest
official
dutch
among
other
documents
at
pretoria
bearing
the
seal
of
the
on
this
scale
the
officers
were
to
receive
lb
of
meat
and
an
undefined
ration
of
meal
rice
or
peas
per
head
per
day
with
a
weekly
allowance
of
groceries
amounting
to
oz
of
coffee
oz
of
tea
and
one
candle
per
head
in
practice
the
meat
ration
dwindled
down
at
times
to
as
little
as
lb
a
week
for
each
officer
and
the
meal
rice
or
peas
being
not
of
the
consumer
but
of
the
burgher
in
charge
were
occasionally
off
the
bill
of
fare
altogether
the
were
each
to
receive
lb
of
flour
lb
of

lb
of
rice
lb
of
dried
french
beans
oz
of
sugar
oz
of
salt
oz
of

and

of
meat
and
had
to
see
that
they
got
it
as
the
boers
being
rather
short
of
luxuries
themselves
claimed
the
right
to
make
reductions
frequently
on
the
plea
that
there
had
been
an
excessive
issue
for
some
previous
day
actually
at
one
time
the
prisoners
at
nooitgedacht
to
whom
the
same
scale
applied
did
not
receive
more
than
an
average
of
lb
of
flour
and
lb
of
meat
per
head
per
week
and
the
beans
which
formed
their
only
vegetable
diet
were
useless
the
captives
among
whom
a
few
of
horse
found
their
lot
cast
at
waterval
were
not
so
badly
off
as
that
but
still
there
was
so
much
monotony
both
in
food
and
in
the
featureless
routine
of
daily
life
that
they
must
have
been
very
glad
to
hear
the
booming
of
british
guns
outside
pretoria
and
to
know
that
the
hour
of
their
deliverance
from
bondage
was
at
hand
a
few
days
after
the
entry
of
our
troops
into
the
capital

the
gratification
of

scouting
ahead
of
the
army
from
bloemfontein
to
the
vaal
lord
roberts
was
so
well
satisfied
with
the
results
achieved
by
general
ian
division
and
the
other
columns
operating
south
of
thaba
on
may
that
he
regarded
all
the
strategical
points
in
that
direction
as
being
securely
held
and
was
therefore
no
longer
anxious
for
the
safety
of
the
railway
on
which
future
supplies
for
his
army
might
be
dependent
after
the
exhaustion
of
those
already
collected
at
bloemfontein
in
these
circumstances
he
determined
on
an
immediate
advance
the
day
after
hamilton
had
cut
the
boer
chain
in
two
at
houtnek
he
accordingly
sent
general
division
from
bloemfontein
to
karree
siding
where
their
arrival
was
hailed
by
horse
as
significant
of
great
things
to
follow
seeing
that
general
brigade
had
been
pushed
forward
to
occupy
the
ground
over
which
mounted
infantry
corps
fought
two
days
earlier
general
brigade
of
mounted
troops
was
ten
miles
west
of
the
railway
at
brakpan
by
doorn
spruit
and
general
ian
division
had
advanced
from
houtnek
to
isabellafontein
the
brandfort
range
of
kopjes
thus
on
the
morning
of
may
de
la
rey
found
his
position
seriously
menaced
and
proved
that
he
had
no
intention
of
making
a
stand
there
longer
than
was
necessary
for
a
rearguard
action
by
which
he
might
delay
the
british
advance
and
give
his
own
main
body
time
to
withdraw
all
heavy
artillery
and
stores
threatened
on
the
left
by
ian
hamilton
and
finding
his
right
flank
in
danger
of
being
turned
by
mounted
infantry
de
la
rey
retired
and
our
troops
entered
brandfort
that
afternoon
the
boers
however
had
fallen
back
to
a
second
position
being
neither
disorganised
nor
beaten
but
only
disinclined
for
close
fighting
and
until
dusk
they
continued
to
show
such
a
firm
front
that
the
mounted
troops
could
do
little
against
them
colonel
lumsden
sums
up
the
situation
briefly
by
the
following
entry
in
his
official
diary
on
the
morning
of
the
we
left
spytfontein
at
daybreak
with
colonel
brigade
and
joined
general
brigade
at
the
foot
of
gun
kopje
the
place
where
major
showers
was
killed
the
mounted
infantry
covering
a
front
of
some
three
miles
swept
the
country
towards
brandfort
infantry
and
guns
following
a
little
desultory
fighting
occurred
driving
in
the
advance
parties
on
to
their
first
position
which
we
found
at
about
the
guns
and
infantry
then
came
up
and
cleared
the
position
in
about
an
hour
during
the
action
we
were
exposed
to
a
good
deal
of
shell
fire
which
fortunately
did
no
harm
owing
to
the
ground
being
soft
and
the
shells
burying
themselves
before
bursting
if
they
burst
at
all
at
the
advance
was
made
on
their
second
and
main
position
about
two
miles
off
and
lying
some
five
miles
of
brandfort
the
enemy
offered
little
resistance
confining
themselves
chiefly
to
artillery
fire
when
the
position
was
practically
taken
the
mounted
infantry
were
sent
away
to
the
right
flank
to
make
a
wide
turning
movement
with
a
view
to
cutting
off
the
retreat
of
tom
who
however
catching
them
on
a
wide
open
plain
forced
them
to
dismount
for
the
attack
the
dismounted
men
advanced
some
two
miles
in
his
direction
but
dusk
setting
in
it
became
evident
that
it
was
impossible
to
reach
that
position
with
daylight
and
we
were
ordered
to
rejoin
our
horses
and
return
to
camp
this
we
reached
about
having
been
in
the
saddle
fifteen
hours
and
covered
quite
forty
miles
there
had
been
no
time
during
the
day
to
feed
the
horses
which
consequently
felt
the
work
very
much
our
casualties
were
nil
but
ten
horses
died
from
exhaustion
to
troopers
in
the
ranks
however
it
seemed
a
much
more
serious
affair
as
well
it
might
for
on
them
fell
the
burden
of
an
advance
that
tried
their
powers
of
endurance
if
it
did
not
put
a
very
severe
strain
on
their
nerves
one
of
them
writing
rather
for
his
own
gratification
than
with
the
idea
of
helping
to
make
history
gives
a
graphic
picture
of
the
movement
out
of
camp
in
the
darkest
hour
before
dawn
to
join
other
troops
and
then
trot
on
through
the
over
ground
on
which
stones
seemed
to
have
cropped
up
suddenly
where
no
stones
had
been
before
so
that
horses
stumbled
at
every
stride
then
as
it
grew
lighter
they
saw
that
a
whole
army
was
with
them
extending
along
a
front
that
stretched
for
miles
horse
halted
under
a
hill
near
ospruit
and
british
guns
opened
fire
from
its
crest
at
this
point
the
hasty
notes
become
ruggedly
picturesque
as
he
describes
the
sequence
of
events
the
boer
artillery
replied
and
it
became
rather
a
hot
corner
shells
burst
all
round
us
and
over
our
heads
we
were
retired
and
lay
down
then
moved
to
the
right
gave
over
our
horses
to
the
even
numbers
and
moved
forward
on
foot
extending
to
some
ten
paces
apart
so
we
advanced
sometimes
mounted
sometimes
on
extended
then
lay
down
then
advanced
again
and
lay
in
long
parallel
lines
horse
being
on
the
extreme
right
or
nearly
so
the
infantry
marched
in
beautifully
regular
and
even
straight
lines
apparently
quite
indifferent
to
the
boer
guns
that
now
opened
on
them
and
made
good
shooting
too
the
shell
fell
all
amongst
those
infantry
but
when
the
dust
cleared
nobody
seemed
to
be
down
and
the
line
went
on
unmoved
then
some
shells
came
in
our
direction
but
either
fell
short
or
whistled
over
our
heads
doing
no
harm
yet
we
were
retired
a
bit
then
a
of
ours
came
into
action
and
silenced
the
boer
guns
this
was
all
straight
ahead
meanwhile
a
gun
opened
across
our
front
at
some
boers
whom
we
could
see
plainly
retreating
on
the
right
they
replied
until
the
behind
us
opened
on
them
then
they
bolted
and
were
chased
by
some
mounted
infantry
who
came
up
on
our
flank
again
we
advanced
on
foot
and
got
near
the
big
kopje
then
colonel
lumsden
rode
up
called
for
the
horses
and
ordered
us
to
advance
and
join
other
corps
of
the
mounted
infantry
in
a
flank
attack
off
we
went
at
a
trot
and
then
extending
to
intervals
of
ten
paces
advanced
towards
the
kopje
in
front
of
us
at
a
walk
but
still
mounted
suddenly
there
was
a
bang
and
a
few
seconds
later
a
shell
burst
dead
on
for
our
centre
but
some
yards
short
after
a
brief
pause
a
second
shell
burst
yards
nearer
and
then
another
the
fragments
of
which
kicked
up
the
dust
all
round
us
this
we
discovered
was
what
cavalry
called
out
to
draw
still
we
advanced
bang
went
the
gun
again
and
there
was
a
cloud
of
dust
followed
by
a
tremendous
report
not
twenty
yards
from
clifford
cayley
and
me
iron
whizzed
over
our
heads
but
nobody
was
hit
our
horses
plunged
and
wheeled
round
and
seeing
everyone
was
off
we
did
not
stop
either
halted
and
dismounted
at
a
farmhouse
lower
down
near
a
stream
where
the
company
assembled
then
handed
over
our
horses
and
advancing
again
with
lots
of
others
on
foot
trudged
a
weary
two
miles
when
a
boer
maxim
opened
on
us
but
though
the
bullets
swept
ground
between
the
front
line
and
ourselves
they
did
no
harm
when
darkness
began
to
fall
the
order
came
for
us
to
retire
and
our
horses
being
brought
up
we
rode
back
over
dykes
and
sluits
and
boggy
places
in
the
pitch
black
nobody
knew
the
way
but
seeing
lights
on
our
right
we
made
for
them
and
got
into
camp
about
not
a
bad
work
having
started
at
with
nothing
whatever
in
the
way
of
food
to
start
on
tied
our
nags
up
everybody
too
tired
to
boil
a
kettle
or
even
light
a
fire
ate
half
a
biscuit
and
some
and
turned
in
the
left
having
come
back
to
camp
comparatively
early
got
into
a
and
made
great
store
of
fowls
turkeys
and
ducks
heard
that
two
foreign
officers
had
been
german
and
one
said
it
was
useless
going
on
as
the
boers
would
not
stand
and
would
not
fight
so
ended
the
battle
of
brandfort

a
sketch
by
colonel
lumsden
takes
up
the
narrative
at
this
point
in
an
official
report
to
the
executive
committee
and
without
attempting
to
describe
the
general
operations
he
gives
a
clear
outline
of
events
in
which
his
corps
took
a
prominent
part
leaving
details
to
be
filled
in
by
troopers
according
to
their
various
views
and
they
give
some
realistic
sketches

only
of
the
actions
but
also
of
the

in
colonel
epitome
of
a
day
when
the
troops
were
supposed
to
rest
and
gain
fresh
vigour
for
a
forward
movement
there
is
a
meaning
that
could
not
have
been
better
expressed
than
it
is
in
this
short
sentence
on
the
we
halted
with
no
food
for
horses
and
only
biscuit
for
the
men
on
the
when
the
enemy
were
driven
from
a
strong
position
on
the
banks
of
vet
river
we
had
a
long
dragging
day
most
of
the
march
being
done
on
foot
to
ease
our
tired
horses
and
with
little
hope
of
finding
any
enemy
in
front
of
us
though
away
on
our
flank
the
artillery
on
both
sides
were
hotly
engaged
at
about
we
suddenly
got
the
order
to
change
direction
to
the
left
and
head
for
vet
railway
station
which
the
enemy
held
in
force
we
crossed
the
vet
river
where
boer
commandos
had
been
making
a
stubborn
stand
and
soon
found
ourselves
among
our
infantry
shortly
afterwards
our
guns
opened
fire
and
our
infantry
came
into
action
while
the
mounted
infantry
were
sent
round
by
our
intercept
if
possible
the
retreating
enemy
it
was
a
race
for
the
same
drift
again
among
the
mounted
infantry
and
we
got
there
first
crossing
the
river
we
were
told
to
push
forward
as
fast
as
possible
and
seize
a
kopje
two
miles
off
which
commanded
a
somewhat
deep
valley
on
the
left
up
which
the
enemy
were
retiring
as
it
was
supposed
to
be
a
race
between
us
and
the
enemy
for
the
kopje
we
had
not
the
time
to
make
a
thorough
reconnaissance
before
approaching
with
the
result
that
our
scouts
arrived
at
the
kopje
only
some
to
yards
before
us
and
the
enemy
had
a
charge
at
us
at
yards
we
immediately
opened
out
and
took
cover
behind
the
bund
of
a
tank
fifty
yards
in
rear
and
dismounting
opened
fire
on
the
kopje
and
silenced
it
we
were
unable
to
stay
there
as
the
enemy
from
the
valley
were
galloping
up
on
our
left
under
the
cover
of
the
kopje
so
i
gave
the
order
to
my
sixty
men
to
mount
and
retire
on
our
supports
who
were
now
coming
up
a
in
rear
we
were
only
just
in
time
for
as
we
were
mounting
the
boer
treated
us
to
a
the
shells
of
which
came
fair
into
the
middle
of
us
the
supports
now
opened
fire
with
two
and
men
and
the
enemy
retired
leaving
us
free
to
return
to
camp
which
we
reached
at
long
day
of
quite
thirty
miles
our
casualties
were
only
one
scout
killed
when
reconnoitring
this
kopje
this
was
private
meares
who
was
shot
through
the
heart
and
whom
we
buried
the
following
morning
one
of
the
scouts
who
was
with
young
meares
when
they
reconnoitred
the
kopje
describes
that
episode
with
convincing
directness
and
incidentally
records
a
very
gallant
action
on
the
part
of
lieutenant
pugh
as
if
it
were
the
most
commonplace
occurrence
following
is
his
version
of
the
affair
given
in
extracts
from
a
private
letter
by
in
the
afternoon
we
were
fairly
in
touch
with
the
enemy
and
an
artillery
duel
commenced
after
some
time
our
fire
grew
too
hot
for
the
boers
and
they
retired
with
their
guns
we
had
been
sent
forward
to
try
to
turn
the
boer
flank
and
our
section
no
b
was
ordered
to
seize
a
kopje
which
was
supposed
to
be
unoccupied
we
of
the
advanced
party
cantered
up
to
within
yards
of
the
sangar
and
then
they
opened
on
us
but
i
must
say
they
made
very
bad
shooting
we
had
got
within
yards
of
them
before
turning
to
retire
and
yet
only
one
man
was
hit
we
were
all
in
line
about
twelve
of
us
in
skirmishing
order
when
the
boers
opened
fire
and
when
the
order
to
retire
reached
us
we
went
back
as
fast
as
we
could
man
who
was
i
were
going
in
the
same
direction
and
as
his
horse
was
dead
done
and
had
already
fallen
once
during
the
day
i
reined
up
so
as
to
get
near
him
in
case
of
need
i
was
just
a
little
ahead
of
him
and
kept
glancing
round
to
see
how
he
was
doing
in
looking
after
him
i
quite
forgot
my
own
horse
and
then
i
know
what
happened
all
i
know
is
that
half
an
hour
afterwards
i
found
myself
breathless
holding
one
of
our
and
running
for
dear
life
my
horse
it
seems
got
into
a
hole
and
came
down
an
awful
crash
on
top
of
me
the
others
thought
both
the
horse
and
i
had
been
shot
almost
immediately
after
this
meares
went
down
shot
through
the
heart
from
the
back
both
our
horses
righted
themselves
and
galloped
back
to
the
section
i
lay
stunned
for
half
an
hour
and
then
as
i
have
told
you
i
staggered
up
to
no
section
who
were
covering
our
retreat
i
believe
i
was
making
straight
for
the
boer
line
of
fire
when
one
of
our
officers
shouted
out
to
me
and
gave
me
his
to
hold
as
i
came
up
to
him
i
was
so
completely
done
after
a
short
run
that
he
got
off
his
horse
and
gave
me
a
lift
on
it
lieutenant
pugh
was
the
man
it
was
dark
by
this
time
and
as
we
had
driven
the
boers
off
we
retired
to
our
camp
i
picked
up
my
section
again
and
found
my
horse
who
was
badly
cut
about
the
head
my
face
was
in
a
lovely
eye
closed
and
my
cheek
forehead
and
nose
one
big
bruise
and
my
head
was
splitting
with
pain
it
was
a
providential
escape
and
if
i
had
not
fallen
i
should
surely
have
shared
fate

and
troopers
in
the
simple
phrases
of
another
trooper
who
relates
with
more
fulness
the
circumstances
in
which
trooper
meares
met
his
death
there
are
some
pathetic
touches
we
had
several
severe
engagements
in
one
of
which
i
am
sorry
to
say
young
meares
was
shot
dead
while
his
company
b
were
retiring
from
a
very
large
force
of
boers
with
a
few
guns
it
was
altogether
a
sad
affair
as
his
brother
willie
was
riding
next
him
being
in
extended
order
however
they
were
fifty
yards
or
so
apart
and
willie
knew
nothing
about
his
brother
being
hit
till
he
got
into
camp
and
found
who
was
missing
it
was
then
some
men
said
they
had
seen
him
fall
off
his
nag
but
could
tell
no
more
willie
went
with
a
party
next
morning
and
found
his
brother
dead
the
was
right
over
his
heart
he
was
buried
there
what
makes
it
all
the
more
pathetic
is
that
young
meares
was
the
only
man
hit
that
day
no
one
else
getting
a
scratch
though
the
boers
made
a
brave
show
up
to
the
last
disputing
every
position
a
hold
of
which
gave
them
any
advantage
the
resistance
offered
by
them
to
horse
was
only
an
expiring
effort
their
right
flank
had
by
that
time
been
turned
by
other
corps
of
mounted
infantry
among
whom
the
colonials
vied
with
each
other
for
distinction
and
at
nightfall
when
australians
with
a
machine
gun
had
come
up
to
relieve
horse
the
enemy
retired
leaving
a
maxim
gun
and
prisoners
in
our
hands
again
however
they
had
carried
off
all
their
heavy
artillery
and
equipage
although
general
ian
hamilton
had
that
afternoon
got
possession
of
winburg
and
was
threatening
their
rear
the
events
of
following
days
are
summarised
briefly
by
colonel
lumsden
in
his
official
report
next
morning
the
saw
us
away
at
daybreak
back
for
the
battlefield
and
towards
the
rising
sun
we
could
see
clearly
how
clever
had
been
the
boer
plan
of
attack
and
how
nearly
they
had
caught
some
of
us
we
followed
up
their
tracks
for
many
miles
halted
at
noon
for
an
hour
continued
scouring
the
time
eventually
headed
west
arriving
at
dusk
at
our
new
camp
near
smaldeel
having
advanced
only
three
and
a
half
miles
after
marching
thirty
away
at
dawn
on
the
and
heading
north
tramped
many
a
mile
on
foot
striking
the
railway
between
vet
and
winburg
a
few
miles
from
vet
and
continuing
north
some
distance
we
halted
for
two
or
three
hours
and
then
retraced
our
steps
to
a
camp
near
the
railway
reaching
it
after
dusk
on
the
our
regiment
did
flank
guard
for
the
infantry
during
a
march
of
twenty
miles
saw
innumerable
buck
and
commandeered
twenty
remounts
on
payment
with
the
incident
thus
delicately
touched
upon
by
colonel
lumsden
an
irresponsible
trooper
deals
more
at
large
in
a
way
that
enables
us
to
understand
the
troubles
by
which
some
commanding
officers
were
beset
when
their
men
unlike
horse
did
not
think
it
necessary
to
go
through
the
formality
of
paying
for
what
they
took
writing
from
smaldeel
the
trooper
says
yesterday
we
went
fairly
straight
but
about
two
or
three
miles
too
far
and
had
to
come
back
but
we
caught
a
young
boer
leaving
his
farm
with
a
rifle
and
ammunition
and
we
got
another
at
the
farm
the
farm
was
looted
of
all
its
the
colonel
stopped
it
when
he
came
up
but
all
the
poultry
was
taken
our
men
paid
for
everything
kruger
has
told
all
these
people
that
their
farms
will
be
burned
and
all
the
women
taken
prisoners
i
think
they
were
rather
relieved
when
we
left
one
woman
said
her
husband
had
come
back
three
weeks
ago
and
died
of
wounds
and
they
said
the
had
lost
terribly
they
never
hear
officially
as
they
keep
the
deaths
dark
but
almost
every
farm
has
lost
at
least
one
man
in
one
we
passed
there
were
three
widows
they
are
rather
nice
people
and
can
nearly
all
speak
english
and
are
rather
we
have
horses
half
with
and
the
other
half
sore
backs
and
we
make
it
up
by
degrees
yesterday
we
collected
eleven
and
the
day
before
about
the
same
but
in
the
night
they
got
away
we
also
brought
along
sheep
and
some
cows
the
sheep
we
have
given
over
to
the
brigade
except
about
twenty
for
our
own
use
we
carry
with
us
two
rations
and
four
on
the
carts
in
case
the
transport
come
up
mcminn
and
francis
of
my
section
got
lost
leading
sick
horses
mcminn
has
attached
himself
to
another
brigade
but
nothing
has
been
heard
of
francis
the
exercised
by
soldiers
who
left
untouched
the
stores
and
paid
for
all
the
they
took
at
every
farm
where
women
and
children
had
been
left
by
the
retreating
boers
will
be
appreciated
by
all
who
know
what
it
is
to
march
and
fight
day
after
day
on
short
rations
though
horse
laid
in
that
store
of
supplies
it
did
not
last
them
many
days
as
we
gather
from
a
continuation
of
the
diary
on
the
the
usual
daybreak
start
our
men
with
two
biscuits
and
one
feed
for
horses
but
the
officers
with
only
some
chocolate
as
we
relied
on
our
mess
cart
being
up
we
were
with
the
main
body
this
day
till
we
neared
the
crossing
of
the
zand
river
at
the
virginia
siding
railway
bridge
which
had
been
blown
up
the
day
before
and
at
this
point
our
companies
were
detached
on
each
side
of
the
drift
to
prevent
a
surprise
we
heard
general
hamilton
having
an
artillery
duel
with
the
foe
some
miles
off
on
our
right
while
on
the
left
we
saw
the
mounted
infantry
dislodging
the
advance
parties
the
war
balloon
with
lord
roberts
and
staff
being
near
the
drift
itself
we
received
orders
to
concentrate
and
move
away
to
the
left
and
on
the
far
side
of
the
river
to
join
our
mounted
doing
which
we
were
immediately
sent
into
action
dismounted
firing
at
yards
while
the
shells
flew
whistling
over
our
heads
as
they
aimed
at
our
guns
behind
us
our
corps
here
got
its
first
definite
order
and
that
was
touch
with
the
enemy
at
any
as
this
came
from
lord
roberts
direct
we
proceeded
to
obey
it
to
the
letter
with
the
result
that
we
were
under
shell
and
rifle
fire
for
the
remainder
of
the
day
having
got
well
ahead
of
the
rest
of
our
brigade
in
following
up
tom
which
halted
and
fired
on
us
at
intervals
we
kept
running
into
the
supporting
infantry
whom
we
only
managed
to
discomfit
thoroughly
when
we
got
at
them
with
our
maxim
on
the
open
hillside
our
losses
were
only
two
horses
wounded
we
were
severely
shelled
several
times
but
we
escaped
casualties
through
being
widely
extended
and
also
through
the
faulty
bursting
of
the
shells
on
one
occasion
ten
shells
burst
among
us
within
five
minutes
about
in
company
with
colonel
ross
i
went
to
endeavour
to
get
some
support
and
brought
up
one
company
of
horse
one
company
tasmanians
and
one
company
south
australian
rifles
afterwards
meeting
general
hutton
with
a
battery
field
artillery
which
promptly
went
into
action
on
our
left
flank
and
shelled
the
boers
who
were
then
retiring
unfortunately
our
force
was
much
too
weak
to
attempt
to
follow
them
in
the
open
had
it
not
been
so
it
was
the
opinion
of
general
hutton
and
colonel
ross
that
we
might
have
captured
the
whole
of
with
a
couple
of
guns
dusk
had
then
drawn
on
and
having
lost
touch
with
our
brigade
we
marched
under
general
orders
to
a
camping
ground
seven
miles
off
in
the
direction
of
kroonstad
arriving
about
without
food
for
men
or
horses
and
there
was
no
firewood
within
miles
the
troopers
had
each
little
else
but
dry
biscuit
the
officers
faring
hardly
any
better
another
correspondent
writes
of
this
affair
we
had
a
very
pretty
fight
at
the
zand
river
and
were
within
an
ace
of
taking
two
of
the
big
guns
to
begin
at
the
beginning
we
had
marched
the
previous
day
from
our
camp
near
smaldeel
to
within
about
five
miles
of
the
zand
river
on
our
arrival
there
we
heard
that
the
australians
and
oxfords
had
been
having
a
skirmish
with
some
boers
at
the
bridge
and
had
seized
a
train
of
stores
but
were
forced
to
retire
starting
at
daybreak
in
the
second
line
of
mounted
infantry
we
got
across
the
drift
all
right
and
drove
the
boer
outposts
back
we
sat
on
the
further
side
of
the
river
for
about
an
hour
watching
them
bring
up
two
big
guns
on
to
a
kopje
about
three
miles
off
and
wondering
when
we
should
be
shelled
presently
we
were
ordered
off
on
a
flank
movement
and
after
trotting
some
miles
came
in
touch
with
the
enemy
we
dismounted
and
moved
up
a
valley
with
good
cover
the
following
they
drove
back
the
boer
riflemen
and
presently
silenced
a
gun
which
had
been
amusing
itself
by
shelling
our
led
horses
but
luckily
without
effect
we
mounted
again
and
started
for
a
gallop
to
get
up
with
their
gun
but
it
had
disappeared
making
a
flank
movement
round
the
shoulder
of
the
position
they
had
occupied
and
pushing
on
some
distance
we
found
them
again
or
rather
they
found
us
first
their
gun
got
our
range
beautifully
but
every
shell
seemed
to
fall
and
burst
between
the
horses
of
course
we
were
widely
extended
retiring
we
dismounted
and
then
advanced
on
foot
but
their
rifle
fire
and
shell
fire
was
too
hot
so
again
we
tried
to
their
position
a
company
and
half
of
b
company
advanced
and
we
climbed
a
small
kopje
with
a
deserted
kaffir
kraal
on
top
horse
some
of
the
australians
and
the
west
riding
mounted
infantry
went
round
and
took
up
a
position
further
along
the
ridge
we
sat
there
for
nearly
two
hours
under
a
terrific
shell
fire
till
it
dawned
on
us
to
move
below
the
brow
for
the
first
they
landed
shell
after
shell
right
into
the
middle
of
us
luckily
very
few
burst
properly
if
they
had
fired
shrapnel
which
bursts
in
the
air
or
lyddite
we
should
all
have
been
blown
off
the
top
they
then
let
our
horses
have
a
few
shots
and
killed
two
and
wounded
three
in
the
meantime
urgent
messages
were
being
sent
for
our
artillery
or
at
least
the
that
generally
come
with
us
but
unfortunately
they
could
get
nothing
but
a
walk
out
of
their
horses
and
the
boers
quietly
trekked
away
we
ought
to
have
had
them
with
the
greatest
of
ease
as
we
were
well
round
them
on
two
sides
and
a
brigade
was
moving
somewhere
on
the
third
if
the
artillery
had
got
up
in
time
we
could
easily
have
moved
round
the
fourth
side
we
tried
to
keep
in
touch
with
the
boers
when
they
retired
but
it
soon
got
dark
and
we
had
to
stop
no
stirring
episodes
or
dramatic
incidents
marked
the
farther
advance
towards
a
stronghold
which
the
free
state
boers
had
declared
that
they
would
defend
to
the
last
colonel
lumsden
deals
with
this
part
of
the
operations
briefly
in
the
following
notes
dawn
on
the
saw
us
in
the
saddle
again
on
the
move
for
kroonstad
the
leading
sections
were
constantly
in
touch
with
the
enemy
and
sometimes
under
heavy
shell
fire
from
which
corporal
kirwan
received
a
scalp
wound
not
very
serious
after
a
long
and
weary
march
we
halted
at
nightfall
near
a
farm
where
we
were
lucky
enough
to
get
some
indian
corn
for
the
horses
and
a
few
sheep
for
the
men
we
made
an
early
start
on
the
for
the
expected
big
fight
at
kroonstad
it
having
been
reported
on
the
previous
evening
that
the
enemy
were
strongly
posted
five
miles
on
our
side
of
the
town
we
advanced
for
ten
miles
with
the
utmost
military
precaution
only
to
find
that
the
enemy
had
vacated
the
position
leaving
kroonstad
undefended
lord
roberts
marched
in
at
followed
by
the
guards
and
the
rest
of
the
infantry
the
mounted
troops
flanking
both
sides
of
the
town
we
occupied
heights
on
the
left
and
halted
there
for
the
night
changing
ground
next
morning
to
our
present
camping
ground
a
mile
distant
where
with
the
rest
of
the
army
we
are
waiting
for
supplies
for
horses
and
men
before
a
forward
movement
towards
pretoria
can
be
made
the
halt
has
been
a
welcome
one
as
our
horses
are
fairly
done
and
i
doubt
if
i
could
mount
men
and
a
few
more
work
like
that
of
the
last
would
reduce
the
numbers
to
we
are
leaving
a
dozen
horses
as
unfit
to
march
and
shot
six
yesterday
cast
horses
wander
about
all
over
the
veldt
and
lie
dead
in
the
river
or
any
other
quiet
place
and
fatigue
parties
are
ceaselessly
at
work
burying
the
bodies
you
can
form
no
idea
of
the
condition
of
our
horses
and
but
for
the
fact
that
we
have
been
able
to
commandeer
and
get
remounts
we
should
have
half
our
corps
dismounted
we
have
lost
quite
horses
already
i
have
stated
officially
that
we
require
immediately
remounts
more
and
these
we
expect
to
get
this
afternoon
looks
like
a
horse
and
i
fear
is
on
her
last
march
the
men
are
all
very
well
and
in
good
spirits
are
most
efficient
cooks
and
if
allowed
would
rank
high
as
looters
but
orders
against
this
are
very
strict
and
our
men
pay
liberally
for
anything
in
the
shape
of
foodstuffs
wherever
procurable
the
office
department
has
been
rather
upset
by
the
loss
of
sergeant
fraser
of
the
bank
of
bengal
who
was
paymaster
and
secretary
but
i
have
replaced
him
by
graves
of
the
same
bank
who
is
working
up
arrears
as
quickly
as
possible
he
is
a
very
willing
and
intelligent
young
fellow
and
will
soon
have
things
straight
again
when
he
gets
a
few
halt
but
it
is
impossible
to
do
much
on
the
line
of
march
the
troops
were
not
all
so
punctilious
as
horse
in
the
matter
of
prompt
payment
for
things
commandeered
and
a
good
story
was
told
of
one
brigade
at
kroonstad
whose
commander
in
despair
of
being
able
to
check
irregularities
issued
an
order
that
loot
was
to
be
carried
openly
on
the
our
soldiers
however
had
not
then
been
reduced
by
hardships
and
scant
fare
to
the
necessity
of
providing
for
themselves
at
all
costs
some
pitiful
cases
of
unauthorised
commandeering
were
reported
in
connection
with
later
operations
when
columns
moving
rapidly
through
several
districts
had
to
draw
supplies
from
boer
farms
and
give
receipts
for
them
in
lieu
of
cash
payments
detached
parties
driven
to
straits
for
want
of
food
did
not
hesitate
to
adopt
the
means
they
had
seen
employed
by
responsible
officers
but
took
care
to
leave
no
trace
by
which
they
could
be
identified
an
officer
who
had
to
investigate
these
cases
told
me
of
one
receipt
given
to
a
boer
widow
it
ran
thus
without
rations
and
hungry
we
have
taken
all
this
poor
woman
had
of
and
food
she
asks
for
a
receipt
i
give
it
god
help
her
to
the
credit
of
british
military
administration
it
must
be
said
that
this
document
though
irregular
was
accepted
as
genuine
and
duly
honoured
by
payment
in
full
horse
had
their
share
of
the
privations
that
made
commandeering
a
necessity
and
even
looting
pardonable
and
it
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
if
some
among
them
regarded
campaigning
in
anything
but
the
roseate
light
that
imagination
had
shed
upon
it
before
they
left
india
yet
even
at
this
time
their
conduct
in
circumstances
that
tried
the
character
of
men
individually
and
collectively
won
approval
from
such
a
soldier
as
colonel
ward
now
sir
edward
ward
permanent
of
state
for
war
singling
them
out
on
the
line
of
march
he
asked
what
regiment
they
were
and
seemed
astonished
to
learn
that
they
were
volunteers
in
a
letter
to
the
editor
he
says
was
much
struck
with
horse
they
were
very
keen
and
excellent
after
an
exceptionally
hard
day
one
of
them
wrote
we
were
in
the
saddle
at
and
did
not
bivouac
till
and
were
under
shell
fire
the
greater
portion
of
the
day
we
had
two
men
and
several
horses
wounded
and
two
or
three
horses
killed
it
seemed
to
me
that
our
task
always
was
to
find
where
the
guns
were
posted
as
we
invariably
drew
their
fire
on
us
it
was
a
fearfully
long
day
and
after
fighting
for
ten
hours
we
had
to
march
for
five
and
when
we
bivouacked
we
had
nothing
but
a
few
dry
biscuits
and
a
little
jam
to
eat
but
we
were
making
coffee
till
midnight
we
were
up
again
at
and
did
an
easy
march
to
kroonstad
where
we
commandeered
two
fowls
and
having
been
served
out
with
fresh
mutton
we
did
ourselves
very
well
indeed
some
potatoes
had
been
left
in
the
farmhouse
garden
and
these
fried
in
dripping
made
a
feast
for
epicures
next
day
we
marched
again
and
after
skirmishing
about
the
hills
above
kroonstad
camped
outside
the
town
it
had
been
evacuated
by
boer
commandos
the
day
before
and
surrendered
without
a
shot
being
fired
lord
roberts
received
quite
an
ovation
as
he
marched
in
but
we
only
heard
the
cheers
as
our
corps
was
not
in
the
town
but
above
it
we
have
now
marched
right
across
the
orange
state
from
bethulie
to
kroonstad
and
are
wondering
how
much
farther
we
shall
go
there
are
all
sorts
of
rumours
about
say
horse
are
to
garrison
kroonstad
others
that
we
go
on
east
to
harrismith
and
others
again
that
we
accompany
lord
roberts
to
pretoria
there
have
been
days
when
but
two
men
were
left
in
the
lines
all
the
rest
have
been
on
fatigue
or
duty
of
some
sort
our
horses
it
is
true
have
been
overworked
and
underfed
but
you
will
be
able
to
form
some
idea
of
the
effects
of
and
other
african
diseases
when
i
tell
you
that
of
the
thirty
men
in
our
section
alone
who
were
well
mounted
when
we
started
from
india
there
are
about
five
of
us
riding
our
own
horses
now
all
the
others
have
remounts
and
our
section
is
not
the
worst
in
this
respect
my
horse
is
doing
me
splendidly
except
for
a
sore
back
for
a
few
days
he
has
never
been
sick
or
sorry
we
have
learnt
to
cook
now
and
can
serve
up
chops
steaks
stews
and
curries
as
well
as
any
we
can
get
the
meat
we
have
been
lucky
lately
in
bivouacking
near
farmhouses
as
we
can
commandeer
chickens
and
sheep
paying
for
them
when
we
are
caught
we
have
for
the
last
few
days
been
getting
to
our
camps
after
sundown
and
by
the
time
the
fires
are
lighted
and
the
meat
ready
to
cook
it
is
quite
it
takes
an
hour
or
so
to
cook
and
the
eating
lasts
longer
as
the
meat
stands
a
deal
of
masticating
we
seldom
get
to
bed
before
and
are
always
ready
by
so
you
can
imagine
how
invigorating
the
climate
of
this
place
is
it
is
bitterly
cold
at
night
and
hot
in
the
day
yet
very
few
of
our
men
are
down
with
fever
it
is
a
fine
climate
but
a
fearful
country
for
miles
and
miles
you
see
nothing
but
immense
undulating
treeless
waterless
tracts
of
poor
here
and
there
you
find
small
ponds
of
dirty
water
but
whether
it
is
dammed
up
or
whether
these
are
springs
i
have
not
yet
been
able
to
ascertain
the
farmers
here
make
their
living
by
breeding
cattle
and
not
by
cultivation
at
all
we
have
marched
from
one
end
of
the
orange
state
to
the
other
and
i
suppose
all
the
cultivation
i
have
seen
would
cover
ten
acres
a
year
of
drought
or
disease
i
should
think
would
tell
very
heavily
on
farmers
here
town
is
the
only
town
in
africa
that
i
can
really
say
i
have
seen
we
either
camped
outside
the
other
towns
or
merely
passed
through
without
having
time
to
see
them
we
rode
through
bloemfontein
and
from
what
i
could
see
of
it
it
seems
to
be
a
large
town
built
on
the
slopes
of
two
or
three
converging
hills
and
fairly
dirty
several
of
the
towns
we
have
passed
consisted
of
zinc
houses
two
at
least
of
which
are
bound
to
be
churches
of
the
remaining
four
one
will
be
a
store
and
the
rest
but
each
is
a
township
in
itself
even
the
marvels
at
the
number
of
people
who
live
in
one
house
no
matter
how
small
it
may
be
there
was
a
farmhouse
near
our
camp
at
bloemfontein
where
we
used
to
go
sometimes
to
get
a
cup
of
coffee
this
house
had
two
rooms
each
one
about
feet
square
it
contained
the
following
permanent
said
they
had
visitors
sometimes
old
woman
and
three
young
ones
and
three
young
men
and
six
children
of
sorts
and
sizes
one
of
the
rooms
was
used
as
a
kitchen
and
larder
so
there
was
only
one
for
general
use
needless
to
say
these
people
were
boers
one
trooper
of
a
company
writing
to
friends
in
calcutta
has
nothing
but
expressions
of
admiration
for
the
behaviour
of
british
bluejackets
to
whom
he
pays
appreciative
tribute
in
the
following
extract
at
zand
river
on
the
i
was
with
the
naval
guns
in
action
it
was
simply
grand
to
see
the
sailors
work
them
they
were
drawn
up
a
drift
in
the
zand
river
by
teams
of
thirty
bullocks
per
gun
and
opened
fire
from
the
top
of
the
left
bank
on
the
position
at
yards
range
and
in
five
shots
had
blown
up
one
boer
gun
and
knocked
the
whole
shoot
down
about
their
ears
when
the
first
gun
was
fired
i
happened
to
be
quite
near
although
at
one
side
of
it
and
the
force
of
the
explosion
made
me
stagger
as
if
a
man
were
in
a
strong
trying
to
make
headway
even
the
novelty
of
such
things
however
soon
began
to
wear
off
and
under
the
depressing
influences
of
life
in
a
rest
camp
outside
kroonstad
the
trooper
took
a
more
gloomy
view
of
things
military
writing
this
place
is
like
most
of
the
towns
in
south
africa
a
mere
cluster
of
tin
huts
with
hardly
a
stone
building
in
the
lot
we
as
usual
are
not
within
a
mile
and
a
half
of
the
town
and
only
one
man
per
section
of
is
allowed
into
it
at
a
time
when
you
do
get
there
there
is
nothing
much
to
buy
or
see
and
prices
are
extremely
high
thank
goodness
the
climate
at
this
time
of
year
is
just
grand
at
night
it
is
very
cold
and
in
the
day
warm
but
never
too
warm
unless
one
happens
to
be
very
hard
at
work
we
seldom
have
any
time
to
ourselves
even
now
though
i
am
writing
letters
i
am
on
duty
with
forty
other
men
grazing
the
horses
about
a
couple
of
miles
from
camp
we
are
in
a
bad
way
for
nags
now
and
very
few
of
the
calcutta
horses
are
left
fun
going
out
to
commandeer
things
from
the
boer
farms
and
it
would
make
a
person
roar
to
see
the
different
things
different
people
choose
to
take
we
are
generally
in
a
bad
way
for
firewood
as
this
is
practically
a
treeless
country
so
we
break
up
chairs
beds
floors
doors
posts
rafters
and
every
blessed
piece
of
wood
to
be
got
here
as
i
sit
on
the
side
of
a
kopje
i
have
a
loaded
rifle
and
cartridge
bandolier
on
and
we
are
warned
to
stand
to
arms
at
any
moment
as
there
are
some
wandering
boers
about
on
the
who
have
cut
the
wires
and
played
old
nick
with
the
railway
and
bridges
wonderful
what
good
health
men
keep
considering
the
hardships
they
go
through
we
have
not
got
a
tent
among
the
lot
of
us
barring
those
small
tents
used
by
the
officers
many
among
us
have
not
even
a
change
of
clothes
on
account
of
a
made
in
regard
to
our
kit
bags
which
got
left
behind
at
a
camp
near
bloemfontein
goodness
knows
if
we
shall
ever
see
those
bags
again
at
present
i
have
only
the
clothes
on
my
back
and
one
extra
pair
of
socks
to
my
name
many
of
us
have
started
growing
long
beards
and
i
have
a
beauty
but
it
wants
a
little
trimming
i
had
a
bath
about
four
days
ago
the
first
for
weeks
and
please
goodness
i
will
have
a
swim
before
leaving
this
place
as
there
is
a
river
here
which
though
rather
full
of
dead
mules
and
horses
is
better
than
nothing
at
all
yesterday
three
horses
got
stuck
in
the
river
and
were
drowned
and
this
morning
when
watering
horses
i
saw
three
mules
and
another
nag
which
belonged
to
our
maxim
gun
team
and
i
fear
that
they
also
have
been
lost
there
is
most
awful
in
some
of
the
rivers
and
ponds
and
on
more
than
one
occasion
we
have
all
but
lost
men
when
crossing
or
watering
i
have
had
about
enough
of
it
and
so
has
everyone
else
it
does
make
a
man
feel
creepy
when
he
has
shells
bursting
about
all
round
and
boer
shells
do
burst
for
all
that
is
said
otherwise
they
make
a
noise
in
the
air
like
a
huge
flock
of
ducks
when
they
take
a
dive
downwards
in
their
flight
and
the
rifle
bullets
going
past
sound
like
a
breeze
playing
in
the
branches
of
a
tree
i
have
now
been
in
three
engagements
and
perfectly
satisfied
i
mind
it
where
there
is
some
cover
and
you
can
see
your
enemy
but
when
the
bullets
come
from
lord
knows
where
real
tough
bread
and
butter
to
chew
the
day
we
lost
so
heavily
the
boers
were
rifle
firing
at
over
yards
and
as
they
use
smokeless
powder
it
was
impossible
to
see
them
in
those
closing
sentences
there
is
a
realistic
touch
that
tells
of
the
weariness
and
from
which
soldiers
invariably
suffer
in
days
of
rest
following
a
succession
of
hard
marches
and
heavy
fighting
when
there
is
stern
work
to
be
done
or
a
foe
to
be
faced
these
men
may
succumb
to
sheer
exhaustion
without
a
word
of
complaint
it
is
only
after
a
day
or
two
of
comparative
inaction
when
supposed
by
a
pleasant
fiction
to
be
resting
in
camp
that
they
will
confess
to
being
tired
of
the
whole
thing
or
as
tommy
expresses
it
fed
a
total
change
comes
with
the
order
for
a
fresh
advance
and
everybody
welcomes
it
except
perhaps
the
regimental
commanding
officer
who
knows
that
his
horses
would

all
the
better
if
given
more
time
to
regain
condition
and
his
men
more
happy
if
there
were
a
chance
of
them
but
what
do
rags
and
tatters
matter
when
days
have
to
be
spent
in
marching
through
clouds
of
red
dust
and
night
blots
out
all
distinction
between
khaki
and
the
soil
on
which
it
is
laid
colonel
lumsden
must
have
felt
the
care
for
such
things
heavy
on
him
but
he
gave
no
sign
of
it
in
the
notes
by
which
he
summarised
the
renewal
of
operations
and
of
hard
work
that
was
in
inverse
ratio
to
the
number
of
words
employed
in
describing
it
we
halted
at
kroonstad
till
the
and
then
moved
out
some
four
and
a
half
miles
to
a
fresh
camp
clear
of
the
town
ready
to
join
colonel
brigade
and
to
start
marching
early
next
morning
nothing
of
interest
occurred
at
kroonstad
except
that
we
were
able
to
leave
behind
a
number
of
horses
these
were
replaced
by
argentines
which
arrived
the
day
before
we
left
in
a
sorry
condition
suffering
from
the
effects
of
forced
marches
made
without
food
except
what
they
could
pick
up
on
the
veldt
the
next
three
days
were
spent
in
long
weary
marches
reconnoitring
the
country
in
front
of
the
main
advance
for
we
had
been
transferred
at
kroonstad
from
general
column
to
the
troops
selected
to
march
with
lord
roberts
just
after
the
men
had
settled
down
in
camp
at
sunset
on
the
bugles
sounded
a
single
g
and
on
hearing
this
signal
all
troops
joined
in
singing
save
the
we
were
expecting
to
be
in
action
every
day
but
nothing
was
seen
of
the
enemy
till
the
when
we
came
upon
him
at
about
in
the
railway
station
near
drift
half
a
mile
from
the
vaal
river
there
some
time
was
spent
in
reconnoitring
to
find
out
the
strength
and
when
a
few
shells
had
been
put
into
the
station
turning
out
only
a
hundred
boers
we
were
too
late
to
stop
the
train
which
had
apparently
been
loading
up
there
it
steamed
unhurt
over
the
vaal
bridge
which
was
immediately
blown
up
a
general
advance
of
the
corps
was
made
dismounted
and
the
enemy
driven
back
so
that
at
noon
the
whole
brigade
was
over
the
vaal
much
to
the
delight
of
the
manager
of
the
mines
who
had
been
in
a
state
of
great
anxiety
he
treated
all
officers
to
breakfast
and
told
us
that
the
boers
had
not
expected
our
force
for
two
days
and
that
the
party
just
ejected
by
us
had
arrived
that
very
morning
with
the
intention
of
blowing
up
his
mines
he
estimated
that
one
million
sterling
had
been
saved
by
our
unexpected
arrival
our
only
casualty
during
the
day
was
sergeant
campbell
slightly
wounded
at
we
moved
off
to
our
new
camp
guarding
the
vaal
bridge
with
the
promise
of
a
halt
next
day
from
this
brief
chronicle
nobody
would
suppose
that
the
honour
of
reconnoitring
and
drawing
boers
out
from
their
among
the
sheds
and
shanties
of
corrugated
iron
at
drift
station
had
fallen
to

sergeant
percy

it
was
my
turn
to
do
the
scouting
and
they
did
very
well
getting
information
that
there
was
a
train
and
fifty
men
in
the
station
this
side
of
the
vaal
two
other
regiments
of
mounted
infantry
each
sent
out
an
patrol
of
about
fifty
men
and
each
came
back
full
split
one
of
their
officers
told
my
scouts
that
if
they
did
not
wish
to
be
shot
they
had
better
clear
but
peddie
thought
this
was
not
business
he
being
in
charge
of
the
advanced
scouts
went
on
till
they
were
fired
on
and
then
halted
we
had
to
wait
for
orders
to
advance
for
about
half
an
hour
and
saw
the
train
steam
out
of
the
station
and
over
the
bridge
and
presently
blow
up
one
span
with
a
dash
we
could
have
caught
the
men
and
train
and
probably
saved
the
bridge
as
we
had
two
maxims
and
we
could
easily
have
driven
the
boers
off
we
then
crossed
the
river
and
drove
their
rearguard
out
of
vereeniging
they
took
the
opportunity
of
burning
a
large
store
of
mealies
at
the
station
our
guns
got
into
them
well
as
they
bolted
across
the
plain
we
had
a
very
nice
fight
and
everyone
is
much
pleased
even
the
chief
of
the
staff
through
all
this
advance
in
which
horse
with
other
corps
of
the
mounted
infantry
reconnoitred
ahead
of
the
army
troopers
who
had
been
trained
to
field
sports
proved
invaluable
and
sometimes
at
least
a
match
for
the
wily
boer
nobody
distinguished
himself
more
by
skill
at
this
work
than
corporal
percy
jones
whom
colonel
lumsden
regarded
as
one
of
his
best
scouts
a
man
of
great
unfailing
in
resources
and
with
a
very
keen
eye
for
a
country
so
that
he
never
allowed
the
section
of
which
he
was
leader
to
be
entrapped
or
surprised
for
repeated
acts
of
daring
enterprise
he
was
promoted
to
the
rank
of
sergeant
and
given
the
medal
others
who
being
selected
for
some
specially
difficult
or
dangerous
duty
had
on
occasion
distinguished
themselves
as
scouts

who
by
actions
of
individual
gallantry
won

little
has
been
said
of
the
privations
endured
by
our
soldiers
during
their
forced
marches
from
kroonstad
to
reach
the
vaal
river
before
its
steep
sandy
banks
could
be
made
formidable
by
entrenchments
as
the
modder
was
some
troops
suffered
severely
from
want
of
sufficient
food
and
nearly
all
were
on
short
rations
it
is
certain
however
that
not
many
could
have
been
so
near
the
ravenous
stage
of
starvation
as
a
private
in
one
colonial
corps
of
whose
act
a
trooper
of
horse
writes
the
day
we
crossed
the
vaal
river
a
very
interesting
thing
happened
we
were
very
hungry
and
when
we
got
to
vereeniging
a
dog
was
seen
running
away
with
half
a
loaf
of
bread
in
his
mouth
immediately
a
private
darted
out
of
the
ranks
and
rode
the
dog
down
took
the
bread
out
of
his
mouth
and
ate
it
at

horse
were
on
transvaal
territory
another
vaunted
stronghold
which
the
boers
had
declared
they
would
defend
to
the
last
extremity
was
in
our
hands
without
even
the
semblance
of
a
struggle
for
it
generals
french
and
hutton
had
crossed
the
vaal
at
important
strategic
points

of

were
thus
held
by
us

for
british
columns
to
enter
the
transvaal
without
opposition
on
the
following
day
lord
roberts
with
his
headquarters
moved
across
drift
and
issued
a
proclamation
declaring
that
the
orange
free
state
had
ceased
to
exist
and
had
become
from
that
moment
an

with

and
companies
of
the
west
riding
and
oxfordshire
light
infantry
forming
the
mounted
infantry
regiment
under
colonel
ross
had
with
other
corps
of
colonel
brigade
been
so
actively
engaged
scouting
ahead
of
the
main
column
with
which
lord
roberts
moved
that
they
had
neither
time
nor
opportunity
to
know
what
was
being
done
by
other
divisions
of
the
army
it
is
necessary
therefore
to
explain
briefly
here
the
general
dispositions
for
an
advance
on
pretoria
at
the
moment
when
lord
roberts
crossed
vaal
river
into
transvaal
territory
since
they
marched
out
of
kroonstad
the
troops
whose
advance
was
most
the
line
of
railway
with
slight
covered
just
a
hundred
miles
in
four
days
mounted
troops
being
employed
to
reconnoitre
on
each
flank
and
keep
up
communications
along
their
front
almost
doubled
that
distance
in
face
of
such
a
rapid
advance
the
boer
commandos
which
had
dispersed
after
their
evacuation
of
kroonstad
found
a
difficulty
in
concentrating
for
the
defence
of
any
strategic
points
they
were
evidently
puzzled
by
the
sudden
mobility
of
british
forces
and
what
with
methuen
marching
for
the
west
cavalry
making
a
dash
for
the
drifts
at
parys
and
reitzburg
as
if
potchefstroom
were
their
objective
the
main
column
pushing
along
beside
the
railway
for
drift
and
ian
hamilton
marching
as
if
for
drift
on
the
road
the
boer
commandants
could
not
agree
as
to
which
point
would
most
likely
be
threatened
first
or
at
which
they
might
make
a
stand
with
the
greatest
chance
of
success
hasty
preparations
were
made
by
them
with
a
view
to
checking
general
ian
hamilton
whom
they
credited
with
a
design
on
heidelberg
and
the
eastern
railways
possibly
that
combined
with
a
great
movement
in
force
upon
the
junctions
outside
johannesburg
might
have
been
the
shortest
way
to
end
the
war
because
as
we
know
now
the
boer
generals
attached
very
little
importance
to
the
defence
of
their
big
towns
while
they
realised
fully
all
the
strategical
advantages
of
free
communication
between
pretoria
and
the
eastern
districts
and
president
kruger
especially
was
anxious
to
keep
open
a
line
by
which
prominent
members
of
his
administration
might
be
able
to
get
away
with
a
sufficient
store
of
bullion
for
private
and
political
uses
at
the
last
moment
the
defenders
of
drift
however
waited
in
vain
watching
the
trap
they
had
laid
for
general
ian
hamilton
his
line
of
march
had
been
suddenly
changed
by
orders
from
lord
roberts
and
instead
of
crossing
the
vaal
where
he
was
expected
east
of
vereeniging
he
had
made
a
rapid
march
westward
to
strike
the
river
between
general
cavalry
and
the
main
body
leaving
our
right
flank
to
be
guarded
by
general
gordon
with
the
cavalry
brigade
with
regard
to
all
this
and
the
ceremony
at
drift
when
lord
roberts
proclaimed
the
annexation
of
orange
free
state
to
the
british
crown
horse
knew
nothing
at
the
time
content
with
their
own
share
of
the
good
work
that
had
been
accomplished
they
were
consoling
themselves
by
the
prospect
of
at
least
one
rest
for
men
and
horses
but
that
good
fortune
was
not
to
be
theirs
after
all
colonel
lumsden
continuing
his
official
record
explains
how
these
pleasant
hopes
were
dashed
the
dawned
the
horses
were
turned
out
to
graze
leave
was
given
for
men
to
go
into
town
and
general
cleaning
up
began
when
suddenly
at
we
had
an
order
to
move
at
once
to
help
the
cavalry
brigade
under
general
gordon
who
was
reported
to
be
in
a
tight
corner
to
the
horses
were
caught
saddles
put
on
and
we
were
away
by
with
no
rations
for
man
or
horse
the
rest
of
the
brigade
joined
in
four
miles
further
on
all
proceeded
with
every
precaution
through
a
difficult
bit
of
trappy
country
arriving
about
at
the
drift
where
general
gordon
was
supposed
to
be
stuck
up
there
no
signs
of
him
could
be
seen
so
we
made
tracks
back
to
a
point
four
miles
north
of
vereeniging
where
we
were
to
have
joined
our
column
when
it
camped
there
that
night
we
struggled
on
until
our
horses
giving
out
the
whole
brigade
bivouacked
at
having
put
behind
us
some
seven
miles
of
our
return
journey
and
having
done
quite
miles
lieutenant
neville
with
a
guide
was
sent
in
to
headquarters
for
instructions
and
returned
at
with
the
order
that
our
brigade
was
to
come
on
at
once
and
resume
its
position
in
front
of
the
headquarters
leading
the
army
by
we
were
away
again
in
the
bitter
frosty
cold
leading
our
starved
horses
the
sun
rising
as
we
waded
a
nasty
drift
over
the
klip
we
reached
our
place
in
the
advance
guard
at
in
the
nick
of
time
just
as
all
had
begun
to
move
off
and
were
at
once
pushed
on
three
miles
at
a
trot
ahead
of
everything
fighting
being
expected
at
the
notorious
klip
river
position
no
boers
however
were
seen
the
country
was
ablaze
with
the
burning
veldt
which
the
boers
had
set
fire
to
systematically
as
they
went
and
the
klip
river
was
gained
without
a
shot
there
were
sounds
of
heavy
fighting

the
hills

our
left
where
french
and
hamilton
were
forcing
back
the
enemy
on
johannesburg
illustration
lieutenant
neville
with
an
editorial
desire
to
link
the
separate
operations
into
one
chain
i
may
here
describe
from
personal
experience
what
happened
away
on
that
left
flank
where
french
and
hamilton
were
hotly
engaged
with
the
outposts
of
a
boer
force
whose
object
in
holding
the
high
kopjes
between
gatsrand
and
klipriviersberg
was
obviously
to
force
upon
us
a
wider
flanking
movement
by
which
the
western
columns
would
be
further
separated
from
the
main
body
and
thus
unable
to
with
it
effectively
it
is
improbable
that
louis
botha
had
any
hope
of
being
able
to
defeat
the
british
forces
in
detail
by
delivering
a
on
each
column
in
turn
it
is
far
more
likely
that
his
idea
even
at
that
period
was
to
lengthen
out
the
british
line
of
communications
as
far
as
possible
thus
weakening
it
by
attenuation
and
making
it
more
vulnerable
to
attacks
by
small
raiding
parties
with
him
was
christian
de
wet
to
whom
such
a
plan
would
have
been
sure
to
commend
itself
as
offering
a
chance
for
numbers
of
to
slip
through
the
girdle
that
was
gradually
closing
about
them
the
vaal
and
harass
their
enemies
on
ground
where
local
knowledge
would
give
them
every
advantage
on
this
supposition
the
resistance
offered
to
general
french
some
miles
of
vereeniging
had
peculiar
interest
for
me
because
i
watched
the
operations
there
with
some
foreknowledge
of
the
probable
boer
tactics
gained
in
a
curious
way
four
days
earlier
i
had
breakfasted
at
a
farm
next
to
christian
de
not
far
from
rodewal
station
the
farmer
invited
myself
and
a
companion
into
his
house
above
which
a
white
flag
was
flying
and
when
told
that
this
was
our
birthday
he
produced
a
bottle
of
whisky
with
which
to
drink
to
her
health
which
we
did
readily
enough
although
he
declined
to
join
us
there
was
no
unfriendliness
or
want
of
hospitality
in
that
and
indeed
we
should
have
mistrusted
the
man
if
he
had
put
on
a
pretence
of
loyalty
because
he
had
been
induced
to
hoist
the
white
flag
as
an
emblem
of
neutrality
there
were
no
troops
at
that
moment
nearer
than
horse
who
could
be
seen
on
the
about
four
miles
westward
moving
towards
vredefort
road
station
from
that
direction
presently
came
a
young
boer
well
mounted
but
unarmed
his
wary
movements
at
first
seemed
to
indicate
that
he
had
no
desire
to
be
seen
by
our
troops
but
our
host
explained
that
the
road
took
many
turns
and
twists
which
might
puzzle
a
stranger
the
horseman
was
evidently
not
well
pleased
to
find
englishmen
at
the
farm
but
this
we
being
somewhat
vain
attributed
to
jealousy
seeing
that
the
youth
and
our
comely
daughter
were
exchanging
glances
in
which
there
might
have
been
a
world
of
other
meaning
though
we
suspected
it
not
we
knew
instinctively
that
they
were
not
quite
strangers
but
there
were
no
signs
of
friendly
recognition
in
our
presence
after
a
brief
conversation
carried
on
between
the
young
man
and
the
farmer
aside
though
neither
of
us
could
have
understood
the
taal
they
talked
our
host
came
forward
and
explained
that
his
neighbour
was
simply
riding
from
one
farm
to
another
where
the
family
had
all
surrendered
and
obtained
their
permits
to
live
in
peace
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
then
except
shake
hands
and
part
but
the
next
day
my
basuto
servant
who
having
lived
in
johannesburg
had
a
wholesome
dread
of
boer
sjamboks
gave
me
a
full
interpretation
of
what
he
had
overheard
the
young
man
say
in
that
neighbourly
talk
with
our
burgher
friend
the
burden
of
it
was
that
this
guileless
youth
ferreira
by
name
had
been
sent
by
christian
de
wet
to
let
everybody
know
why
the
free
state
commandos
were
retiring
with
transvaalers
instead
of
defending
their
own
homesteads
it
was
only
to
lure
the
english
on
to
destruction
and
christian
de
wet
promised
that
he
would
slip
back
again
in
a
day
or
two
to
rodewal
and
play
old
harry
with
the
invaders
up
to
the
time
of
joining
general
force
in
the
afternoon
of
may
i
had
regarded
this
as
a
vain
boast
a
closer
study
of
boer
tactics
however
was
enough
to
show
what
they
were
playing
for
and
i
watched
with
some
apprehension
our
cavalry
moving
westward
in
vain
attempts
to
outflank
the
mobile
boers
who
were
galloping
from
kopje
to
kopje
on
one
side
of
a
vast
dam
fringed
by
treacherous
mires
which
squadrons
could
not
cross
ian
hamilton
meanwhile
conformed
to
this
movement
without
getting
touch
of
the
enemy
or
drawing
near
to
their
stronghold
which
was
obviously
on
the
frowning
crest
of
klipriviersberg
shortened
by
the
boers
colloquially
to
riviersberg
being
alone
and
far
from
my
supplies
i
slept
supperless
that
night
in
a
deserted
boer
store
for
the
sake
of
such
shelter
as
a
wall
and
roof
might
give
from
a
keen
icy
wind
that
swept
in
gusts
through
the
broken
windows
i
had
neither
overcoat
nor
blanket
and
saw
nothing
to
lie
on
but
a
filthy
floor
or
the
bare
laths
of
a
rickety
iron
bedstead
i
chose
the
latter
having
been
in
the
saddle
from
in
the
morning
until
at
night
with
the
exception
of
necessary
halts
for
my
horse
to
graze
i
was
soon
oblivious
to
the
discomfort
of
that
rude
couch
and
for
all
i
knew
my
pillow
might
have
been
softest
down
instead
of
hard
but
long
before
daybreak
the
cravings
of
a
hunger
that
had
only
been
tantalised
by
coffee
and
biscuit
hours
earlier
awoke
me
to
a
consciousness
that
my
limbs
were
aching
with
cold
and
sore
from
the
chafing
of
those
laths
striking
a
light
i
looked
at
the
little
thermometer
attached
to
my
wallet
and
found
that
it
registered
ten
degrees
of
frost
more
sleep
was
not
to
be
thought
of
so
i
groped
through
the
darkness
to
a
stall
only
less
draughty
than
the
store
i
had
slept
in
found
my
horse
shivering
there
rubbed
him
down
with
a
wisp
of
straw
by
way
of
restoring
his
circulation
and
my
own
and
waited
for
the
dawn
then
i
found
my
way
across
vleis
and
spruits
to
where
general
ian
force
was
moving
off
through
dense
mists
from
cyferfontein
to
attack
the
boer
position
on
riviersberg
when
the
rising
sun
dispelled
those
mists
the
gordons
and
city
imperial
volunteers
were
spread
out
in
thin
lines
stretching
across
a
segment
of
the
veldt
and
so
they
went
on
hour
after
hour
without
finding
any
sign
of
boers
the
pangs
of
hunger
being
i
rode
off
in
search
of
a
farm
hoping
also
to
come
across
another
british
column
within
a
few
miles
after
an
hour
or
more
i
was
gladdened
by
the
sight
of
haartebeestefontein
farm
standing
in
the
midst
of
green
and
belted
about
by
eucalyptus
very
picture
of
peace
at
that
moment
four
boers
drove
out
from
the
in
a
cape
cart
but
made
no
sign
at
sight
of
me
except
by
driving
the
faster
they
have
been
in
such
a
hurry
to
get
away
from
an
unarmed
and
famished
englishman
who
had
not
one
comrade
within
miles
but
luckily
they
know
though
cavalry
had
been
at
the
farm
a
day
before
me
and
ransacked
the
deserted
house
in
search
of
any
documents
that
might
have
been
left
there
ducks
were
swimming
in
a
pond
close
by
and
fowls
cackling
about
the
sheds
from
which
some
kaffirs
presently
appeared
to
my
request
for
bread
or
eggs
or
milk
they
had
but
one
answer
the
sight
of
a
loaded
revolver
might
have
produced
some
effect
but
having
none
i
dismounted
and
made
a
systematic
search
if
food
in
any
shape
was
there
it
must
have
been
very
cleverly
hidden
finding
not
so
much
as
a
bundle
of
for
my
horse
to
nibble
at
i
rode
on
across
ridge
and
hollow
another
five
miles
or
so
and
then
came
upon
a
little
dorp
or
hamlet
from
which
all
the
inhabitants
except
a
dutch
schoolmaster
and
his
wife
had
disappeared
they
declared
that
not
a
scrap
of
food
had
been
left
behind
but
the
good
vrau
gave
me
a
cup
of
excellent
coffee
and
with
thanks
for
the
best
of
hospitality
which
gives
all
it
can
i
jogged
along
another
league
or
two
following
the
straight
road
towards
johannesburg
and
expecting
every
minute
to
fall
in
with
the
rearguard
of
a
column
going
that
way
all
the
while
i
had
not
seen
a
single
soldier
or
the
trace
of
an
hoof
that
was
not
at
least
a
day
old
the
unmistakable
marks
of
boots
were
not
there
and
neither
horse
nor
man
had
left
footprints
on
tracks
where
the
thaw
had
softened
them
at
last
from
a
rugged
ridge
i
saw
smoke
curling
up
from
houses
among
the
trees
that
marked
the
course
of
a
river
some
two
miles
ahead
not
caring
much
by
that
time
whether
britons
or
boers
might
be
in
those
houses
i
rode
straight
for
the
nearest
of
them
which
turned
out
to
be
a
farm
in
the
barn
of
which
i
saw
much
forage
evidently
none
of
our
mounted
troops
had
been
there
but
it
was
too
late
to
think
of
turning
back
that
in
all
probability
would
have
brought
a
mauser
bullet
whistling
about
my
ears
was
the
only
game
to
play
in
such
circumstances
so
i
called
to
a
kaffir
servant
told
him
to
fetch
forage
for
my
horse
and
then
swaggered
towards
the
house
as
if
i
had
been
a
staff
officer
with
a
whole
regiment
at
my
back
on
the
stoep
a
bearded
boer
met
me
he
had
been
lying
prone
on
ground
where
rhenoster
bushes
grew
their
burrs
were
still
sticking
to
his
serge
jacket
the
left
elbow
of
which
was
stained
by
the
red
earth
on
which
it
had
rested
and
his
right
thumb
was
black
with
a
coating
of
burnt
melinite
i
saw
it
all
as
he
raised
one
hand
in
a
sort
of
salute
and
extended
the
other
to
welcome
me
and
in
that
moment
i
knew
he
had
just
come
down
from
riviersberg
heights
for
lunch
in
the
intervals
of
fighting
so
still
playing
an
assumed
part
i
asked
what
weapons
he
had
and
he
brought
me
a
but
that
was
not
what
i
wanted
after
some
show
of
misunderstanding
the
boer
brought
his
wife
who
talked
english
fluently
enough
and
when
i
had
explained
to
her
the
awful
consequences
of
concealing
arms
or
ammunition
from
a
british
officer
holding
plenary
powers
of
punishment
there
was
no
necessity
for
saying
any
more
without
even
waiting
for
my
words
to
be
interpreted
her
husband
went
out
and
came
back
with
a
mauser
rifle
the
fouling
of
which
was
still
moist
round
its
and
a
bandolier
half
full
of
cartridges
these
i
took
charge
of
not
knowing
what
i
should
do
with
them
if
a
boer
commando
happened
to
come
that
way
as
to
british
at
any
rate
i
had
no
hesitation
in
assuring
the
boer
that
his
household
would
be
safe
from
them
i
did
not
think
it
necessary
to
add
that
none
would
be
likely
to
come
anywhere
near
him
in
return
for
my
leniency
save
the
mark
he
suggested
something
that
had
been
in
my
mind
all
the
while
and
thereupon
his
good
wife
brought
a
deliciously
white
loaf
and
milk
that
was
fragrant
in
its
freshness
she
was
sorry
that
they
nothing
better
to
nothing
better
heavens
how
sweet
it
tasted
yet
i
was
restrained
from
eating
or
drinking
much
by
the
thought
that
any
show
of
my
famished
state
would
give
me
away
it
was
difficult
to
parry
all
questions
concerning
the
number
of
troops
i
had
with
me
so
i
said
that
my
men
must
have
found
a
lot
of
arms
to
collect
or
they
would
have
been
there
sooner
upon
that
the
boer
volunteered
information
as
to
the
number
of
rifles
which
could
possibly
be
in
farms
or
cottages
round
about
all
this
information
i
noted
down
ostentatiously
wondering
as
i
did
so
how
on
earth
i
should
get
out
of
the
hole
into
which
circumstances
were
thrusting
me
deeper
and
deeper
at
that
moment
as
luck
would
have
it
two
west
australians
of
the
regiment
turned
up
and
leaving
them
to
collect
the
arms
of
which
such
careful
note
had
been
made
and
to
eat
the
remnants
of
my
unfinished
meal
i
mounted
to
ride
off
in
quest
of
their
main
body
taking
care
however
to
command
proper
protection
for
the
house
in
which
i
had
been
so
hospitably
entertained
played
said
one
with
much
outward
show
of
respect
as
he
produced
a
bottle
of
brandy
from
the
ample
pocket
of
his
british
warm
and
offered
me
a
nip
i
saw
that
he
at
any
rate
understood
the
game
at
eikenhof
drift
i
found
the
main
body
which
turned
out
to
be
no
more
than
a
patrol
its
appearance
drew
fire
from
the
boers
who
were
apparently
holding
that
road
into
johannesburg
strongly
they
began
to
show
in
groups
of
twenty
and
thirty
on
kopjes
where
no
sign
of
them
had
been
seen
before
and
were
evidently
meditating
a
movement
by
which
the
drift
might
have
been
outflanked
to
prevent
this
major
pilkington
who
was
in
command
detached
some
men
from
his
scanty
force
to
hold
two
smaller
fords
and
in
a
short
time
there
were
several
casualties
from
rifle
fire
at
short
range
just
then
we
could
hear
the
roar
of
guns
where
general
ian
hamilton
was
attacking
miles
away
on
the
left
hard
pressed
yet
determined
to
hold
on
where
he
was
major
pilkington
had
not
a
galloper
whom
he
could
send
with
a
message
to
his
divisional
general
i
volunteered
to
carry
it
and
started
for
a
ride
of
twenty
miles
across
unknown
country
making
sure
that
i
should
hit
off
some
column
within
that
distance
but
all
the
troops
under
the
immediate
command
of
lord
roberts
had
been
following
the
line
of
their
front
was
cleared
by
the
mounted
infantry
with
which
were
horse
and
other
regiments
of
colonel
a
turning
movement
the
extent
of
which
will
be
appreciated
after
perusal
of
the
preceding
narrative
i
had
ridden
a
distance
that
would
have
measured
nearly
thirty
miles
from
point
to
point
without
seeing
more
than
a
small
patrol
of
british
troops
that
night
or
early
the
next
morning
when
major
pilkington
had
withdrawn
his
small
force
a
thousand
free
state
boers
crossed
eikenhof
drift
and
got
in
rear
of
the
british
columns
to
rejoin
de
wet
meanwhile
with
french
or
hamilton
on
the
west
and
in
advance
of
the
main
body
on
the
east
deeds
were
being
done
that
sealed
the
fate
of
johannesburg
and
pretoria
horse
took
a
full
share
of
honours
that
day
though
their
colonel
does
not
descant
upon
these
at
great
length
in
his
official
report
but
contents
himself
with
the
following
record
on
the
we
marched
at
expecting
to
arrive
after
ten
miles
at
natal
spruit
where
fighting
was
certain
our
maps
and
information
were
however
wrong
for
we
found
ourselves
most
unexpectedly
in
sight
of
the
place
with
the
smoke
of
the
train
leaving
the
station
we
were
sent
to
endeavour
to
cut
it
off
as
it
wound
about
the
kopjes
and
had
a
very
exciting
gallop
of
three
miles
blowing
up
the
railway
behind
the
train
again
we
pushed
on
to
try
and
cut
her
off
at
the
next
big
bend
but
again
were
too
late
and
ran
into
the
fire
of
a
party
covering
the
retreat
of
the
train
we
then
took
up
a
position
commanding
the
railroad
while
under
colonel
orders
a
party
of
five
men
was
sent
to
block
the
line
at
any
cost
this
very
dangerous
task
was
given
to
lieutenant
pugh
and
the
undermentioned
men
who
carried
it
out
with
great
determination
and
coolness
privates
turner
were
dagge
and
parks
an
officer
of
high
rank
whose
opportunities
of
knowing
what
happened
give
especial
value
to
his
testimony
says
on
may
the
mounted
infantry
were
ordered
to
move
from
klip
drift
to
cut
the
natal
railway
line
the
springs
line
the
main
line
north
of
elandsfontein
and
the
telegraph
wires
at
important
points
when
near
the
junction
of
natal
and
free
state
lines
we
saw
a
of
burghers
from
natal
passing
northwards
to
where
beyond
the
junction
the
railway
runs
from
a
broad
valley
into
one
of
several
converging
kopjes
through
a
deep
cutting
in
the
steep
and
rugged
hillside
with
the
object
of
heading
off
that
train
as
it
slackened
speed
on
a
stiff
gradient
horse
made
a
great
gallop
up
the
valley
towards
a
point
where
it
narrows
to
a
neck
from
which
the
hills
rise
abruptly
on
each
side
their
course
for
two
or
three
miles
was
over
rough
ground
parallel
to
the
railway
and
nearly
midway
between
it
and
a
branch
of
natal
spruit
they
were
unable
however
to
arrive
in
time
and
the
boers
detraining
occupied
a
kopje
just
above
the
railway
cutting
the
gorge
and
banks
of
which
they
could
command
from
the
ridge
above
and
from
a
hut
which
they
also
held
in
force
thus
they
had
the
railway
between
them
and
horse
and
seemed
in
a
good
position
for
sweeping
all
approaches
to
it
by
an
effective
rifle
fire
horse
dismounted
in
the
hollow
and
advanced
against
that
kopje
it
was
however
necessary
to
destroy
the
line
and
the
engineer
officer
who
accompanied
the
force
for
the
purpose
of
blowing
up
the
line
was
not
handy
lieutenant
pugh
with
four
men
then
volunteered
to
get
into
the
cutting
at
its
deepest
point
and
either
block
or
break
it
as
the
boers
were
holding
the
hut
close
to
this
point
it
was
a
warm
corner
however
pugh
and
his
party
reached
the
line
the
four
men
covered
his
further
advance
from
the
edge
of
the
embankment
whilst
he
descended
into
the
cutting
having
nothing
wherewith
to
break
the
line
he
effectually
blocked
it
with
a
number
of
huge
sufficient
to
stop
any
train
passing
through
this
occupied
some
time
and
his
covering
party
were
pretty
busy
with
the
boers
at
the
hut
who
were
at
first
inclined
to
run
in
on
him
but
as
one
or
two
of
them
paid
dearly
for
their
temerity
their
efforts
ceased
so
that
pugh
and
his
party
were
enabled
to
retreat
from
their
little
picnic
without
loss
pugh
is
now
a
it
was
a
long
and
hard
day
that
of
may
the
mounted
infantry
were
under
fire
from
till
horse
were
among
the
troops
in
at
the
finish
on
the
hill
north
of
elandsfontein
where
the
parting
duel
was
fought
with
the
boers
as
they
retreated
all
the
lines
were
cut
the
consequent
bag
was
fourteen
engines
and
over
a
bad
work
even
lord
kitchener
is
reported
to
have
when
he
heard
the
news
illustration
harrington
lieutenant
pugh
this
incident
is
described
with
further
detail
in
a
private
letter
by
lieutenant
pugh
who
modestly
minimising
his
own
share
in
a
very
hazardous
enterprise
writes
yesterday
our
orders
were
to
take
elandsfontein
cut
the
wires
and
blow
up
the
railway
and
to
do
the
same
at
germiston
the
first
excitement
began
at
elsburg
where
we
saw
a
train
going
out
of
the
station
seeing
it
was
on
the
move
we
sent
some
men
to
try
to
cut
it
off
but
it
went
back
up
an
angle
like
the
darjiling
train
there
was
another
angle
and
we
galloped
about
three
miles
to
that
part
but
the
train
was
too
fast
and
went
round
a
kopje
where
its
occupants
evidently
got
out
and
opened
fire
on
us
if
we
had
known
the
line
we
would
have
got
that
train
easily
by
going
to
the
left
instead
of
to
the
right
while
we
were
dismounted
and
firing
an
order
came
for
six
men
to
rush
for
the
line
and
try
to
block
it
the
colonel
passed
on
for
the
six
men
at
the
end
to
go
it
happened
to
be
partly
my
section
and
partly
no
one
man
could
not
find
his
horse
so
i
went
off
with
four
men
and
galloped
right
up
to
the
railway
and
under
the
embankment
it
was
held
by
a
fairly
strong
picket
who
luckily
did
not
fire
till
we
were
under
cover
i
put
two
men
on
to
fire
at
that
picket
of
which
three
were
range
was
only
about
fifty
the
other
two
on
to
about
on
our
left
front
or
yards
off
we
were
also
fired
at
from
a
kopje
on
our
right
the
picket
presently
cleared
and
i
made
a
rush
for
the
line
it
was
in
a
cutting
and
out
of
the
fire
i
rolled
some
boulders
on
the
lines
and
on
getting
back
found
a
pretty
hot
fire
had
opened
on
us
from
behind
it
turned
out
to
be
one
of
our
own
maxims
we
mounted
and
galloped
back
without
a
scratch
colonel
orders
then
were
to
push
on
and
support
the
mounted
infantry
who
held
a
kopje
on
our
right
here
we
lay
for
two
hours
our
position
overlooking
the
boksburg
railway
station
supported
by
two
colt
guns
from
battery
which
kept
up
a
steady
fire
in
answer
to
the
shells
and
bullets
until
their
retirement
we
then
continued
the
turning
movement
to
the
right
and
took
possession
of
the
station
halting
there
for
a
few
minutes
to
while
the
royal
engineer
company
attached
to
us
for
the
purpose
blew
up
the
line
at
this
point
one

our
sailors
private

up
the
telegraph
post

all
communication
with

at
the
time
we
and
a
company
of
horse
were
the
only
troops
up
and
being
reinforced
by
two
companies
of
the
mounted
infantry
which
were
placed
under
my
orders
we
were
told
to
proceed
with
all
speed
due
west
to
blow
up
the
pretoria
line
which
we
should
find
four
miles
on
we
succeeded
in
doing
this
but
too
late
to
cut
off
one
train
which
just
evaded
us
our
horses
being
too
done
to
go
faster
than
a
modest
trot
we
again
halted
a
few
minutes
facing
a
long
kopje
in
front
of
us

while
the

were
busy
blowing
up
the
railway
at
this
point
captain
rutherfoord
on
the
left
with
our
scouts
with
his
usual
keenness
soon
came
in
touch
with
those
of
the
enemy

brisk
fire
ensued
on
both
sides
captain
rutherfoord
holding
his

i
was
able
to
reinforce
him
on
his

colonel
ross
soon
hurried
up
further
reinforcements
on
his
left
which
enabled
us
to
hold
the
kopje
and
forced
the
enemy
to
fall
back
on
the
convoy
they
were
covering
as
night
was
approaching
pursuit
with
our
tired
horses
was
utterly
hopeless
and
we
were
ordered
to
move
to
our
left
and
encamp
at
germiston
which
lay
in
the
hollow
behind
us
this
being
the
junction
of
railway
lines
that
branch
off
in
several
directions
was
the
key
of
the
boer
position
our
movements
had
however
been
very
successful
and
colonel
henry
issued
a
brigade
order
next
morning
saying
he
had
been
congratulated
by
the
on
the
work
while
colonel
ross
was
also
congratulated
on
the
prominent
part
taken
by
his
corps
which
resulted
in
the
capture
of
fourteen
engines
and
a
large
quantity
of
this
was
very
pleasant
news
to
us
but
the
work
was
telling
its
tale
on
the
horses
who
were
dead
beat
and
fast
tumbling
to
pieces
from
overwork
and
want
of
food
our
casualty
was
fortunately
only
one
during
the
private
bewsher
who
was
shot
through
the
knee
while
we
were
engaging
the
enemy
opposite
boksburg
owing
to
the
pace
we
had
travelled
and
the
hilly
nature
of
the
country
our
maxim
gun
under
captain
holmes
with
its
escort
had
not
come
into
camp
when
we
retired
to
bed
the
men
as
on
many
previous
occasions
had
to
turn
in
without
food

were

eight
men
of

in
charge
of
sergeant
macnamara
were
sent
out
in
a
big
patrol
under
captain
harris
west
riding
with
orders
to
take
the
johannesburg
waterworks
captain
harris
paraded
his
sixty
men
and
chose
two
of
horse
as
his
orderlies
we
then
rode
down
the
kopjes
to
the
plain
below
horse
firing
over
our
heads
at
the
boers
all
the
time
as
we
went

we
met

being
brought
in
wounded
through

when
on

with
lieutenant
pugh
about
a
mile
away
there
was
a
farmhouse
under
the
kopje
which
was
held
by
the
boers
some
australians
with
us
rushed
the
place
and
captured
three
boers
and
a
waggon
of
ammunition
after
marching
about
an
hour
firing
every
now
and
then
and
being
fired
at
we
got
to
the
waterworks
on
a
hill
towering
above
johannesburg
the
fort
is
on
another
hill
half
a
mile
away
it
seemed
as
if
trenches
had
been
dug
for
us
round
the
waterworks
high
banks
of
gravel
perfectly
protecting
us
trooper
preston
of
horse
was
sent
back
to
germiston
with
a
despatch
saying
the
waterworks
were
occupied
he
was
to
make
the
shortest
possible
cut
and
gallop
all
the
way
this
orderly
had
a
very
exciting
adventure
his
shortest
road
lay
through
the
outskirts
of
johannesburg
when
riding
through
these
streets
he
saw
several
boers
peeping
out
of
their
houses
and
at
one
place
they
actually
tried
to
stop
him
he
galloped
through
them
however
they
then
shouted
out
to
know
if
the
english
were
in
johannesburg
yet
and
he
answered
that
they
were
knowing
that
if
he
said
no
he
would
as
likely
as
not
be
shot
at
they
then
asked
where
he
was
going
to
and
he
said
pretoria
thus
it
was
that
a
man
of
horse
was
the
first
or
one
of
the
first
to
enter
johannesburg
a
little
further
the
orderly
met
two
kaffirs
who
could
talk
english
and
who
told
him
that
among
the
rocks
on
a
small
kopje
on
the
left
of
the
road
was
an
armed
boer
waiting
to
shoot
him
the
orderly
was
puzzled
what
to
do
as
he
could
see
no
boer
behind
the
rocks
however
he
dismounted
and
advanced
on
foot
towards
the
kopje
leading
his
horse
behind
him
having
got
within
speaking
distance
of
the
rocks
and
still
seeing
no
boer
he
put
his
rifle
to
his
shoulder
and
pointed
it
at
the
biggest
rock
shouting
out
up
or
i
fire
immediately
two
arms
were
seen
above
the
rock
the
order
up
your
was
obeyed
at
once
and
the
orderly
found
he
had
captured
the
boer
about
a
mile
further
on
he
met
some
australians
and
having
to
gallop
with
the
despatch
he
handed
the
prisoner
over
to
them
taking
with
him
the
rifle
and
ammunition
alas
at
the
door
of
the
tent
whom
should
he
meet
but
lord
kitchener
himself
who
seeing
the
orderly
had
two
rifles
commandeered
one
meanwhile
the
boers
kept
up
a
continuous
fire
at
the
waterworks
however
several
englishmen
and
young
ladies
had
climbed
up
the
hill
at
the
back
and
brought
food
and
drink
for
the
first
of
their
countrymen
whom
they
had
of
them
while
tommy
ate
and
drank
firing
away
with
the
rifles
at
the
fort
in
the
evening
preston
brought
the
message
to
retire
to
camp
which
was
done
in
a
very
orderly
fashion
the
patrol
arriving
back
soon
after
dark
with
the
total
casualties
of
three
men
wounded
having
spent
the
most
or
one
of
the
most
exciting
and
agreeable
days
in
the
whole
campaign
colonel
lumsden
describes
other
incidents
in
the
following
passage
a
party
of
west
riding
mounted
infantry
scouting
on
our
left
did
not
get
off
so
easily
for
seeing
some
men
in
khaki
and
helmets
to
their
front
they
mistook
them
for
friends
and
getting
within
speaking
distance
were
much
surprised
to
find
their
greetings
met
with
a
summons
to
surrender
their
immediate
attempt
at
flight
resulted
in
two
wounded
and
taken
prisoner
the
other
although
wounded
getting
back
to
camp
firing
then
became
general
on
our
right
where
the
cavalry
brigade
was
on
outpost
duty
and
we
were
hastily
summoned
to
saddle
up
and
reinforce
them
we
arrived
in
time
to
witness
an
artillery
duel
the
boers
retiring
slowly
under
the
fire
of
the
cavalry
the
work
however
resulted
badly
for
them
they
having
had
sixteen
casualties
which
were
attended
to
by
our
medical
officer
captain
powell
who
was
luckily
on
the
spot
we
then
returned
to
camp
and
shortly
afterwards
captain
holmes
came
in
with
his
maxim
gun
reporting
that
he
had
lost
two
of
his
scouting
party
privates
and
watson
whom
he
had
sent
out
in
advance
while
journeying
to
rejoin
us
in
the
early
morning
a
few
hours
afterwards
the
missing
men
came
into
camp
stating
that
having
been
informed
that
our
men
were
in
front
they
had
ridden
confidingly
into
a
body
of
about
fifty
men
dressed
like
our
own
troops
in
khaki
thinking
they
were
friends
but
were
suddenly
disillusioned
by
being
ordered
to
surrender
under
the
conditions
attempting
to
escape
on
their
horses
was
out
of
the
question
and
they
had
no
option
but
to
deliver
up
their
arms
they
were
as
to
our
strength
and
the
likely
duration
of
the
war
private
watson
in
reply
to
the
latter
question
told
the
general
that
he
considered
fighting
would
be
over
in
a
few
days
a
reply
that
seemed
to
cause
much
amusement
they
were
then
offered
the
choice
of
remaining
as
prisoners
or
giving
their
word
of
honour
that
they
would
fight
no
more
during
this
war
they
chose
the
latter
thinking
the
end
was
very
near
next
morning
june
our
orders
were
to
march
on
johannesburg
six
miles
distant
which
we
reached
unopposed
in
time
to
see
the
union
jack
hoisted
over
the
fort
which
had
been
divested
of
all
its
guns
except
a
few
rendered
useless
we
then
marched
some
five
miles
north
of
the
city
and
camped
for
two
days
on
the
morning
of
the
we
marched
twelve
miles
towards
pretoria
meeting
no
resistance
but
again
losing
touch
with
our
maxim
which
being
unable
to
follow
us
across
country
had
to
stick
to
the
road
and
which
we
were
destined
not
to
see
for
several
days
so
horse
had
gratified
one
desire
on
which
their
hearts
were
set
for
many
months
their
brigade
had
led
the
fighting
line
practically
into
johannesburg
and
when
the
union
jack
was
hoisted
over
its
public
buildings
they
cared
nothing
for
the
ceremonial
parades
but
were
only
anxious
to
take
the
lead
again
in
a
march
on
pretoria
with
brevity
colonel
chronicle
sums
up
the
operations
of
an
eventful
day
on
june
we
advanced
to
six
mile
spruit
again
being
the
foremost
corps
of
the
leading
brigade
all
anticipating
a
heavy
fight
in
front
of
us
as
the
spruit
was
said
to
be
our
last
position
and
likely
therefore
to
be
desperately
contested
these
prognostications
were
not
however
realised
careful
reconnaissance
showed
that
there
were
no
boers
at
the
spruit
we
then
proceeded
leisurely
up
the
chain
of
hills
beyond
it
concluding
they
were
not
held
but
with
every
precaution
against
the
unexpected
it
was
not
until
midday
that
we
came
in
touch
with
the
enemy
who
opened
on
the
mounted
infantry
on
our
right
with
shell
fire
we
were
then
pushed
forward
to
take
a
commanding
kopje
and
got
a
smart
peppering
from
a
few
snipers
hidden
in
the
rocks
on
our
left
flank
but
had
no
casualties
though
the
bullets
were
falling
thickly
among
us
as
we
crossed
the
open
it
now
became
evident
that
the
main
position
was
on
our
left
and
i
was
ordered
to
occupy
a
ridge
about
one
mile
distant
in
that
direction
opposite
a
steep
kopje
about
yards
off
held
by
the
boers
here
they
were
beautifully
entrenched
and
kept
up
a
steady
fire
on
our
line
which
we
returned
with
interest
until
aid
arrived
in
the
shape
of
three
on
the
right
two
on
our
left
and
three
colt
guns
in
the
centre
these
searched
the
ridge
for
some
hours
without
dislodging
the
boers
whose
trenches
must
have
been
admirably
constructed
as
a
move
on
our
part
from
one
rock
to
another
was
sufficient
to
draw
a
hail
of
bullets
while
we
were
unable
to
spot
a
single
boer
here
private
charles
stuart
was
wounded
by
a
bullet
through
the
ankle
but
was
unable
to
be
removed
from
the
firing
line
until
the
fire
slackened
late
in
the
afternoon
when
a
kind
friend
carried
him
down
on
his
back
to
the
ambulance
tonga
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
at
about
the
fire
began
to
dwindle
and
eventually
ceased
altogether
and
just
as
we
meditated
leaving
our
ridge
to
cross
over
to
theirs
our
infantry
became
visible
advancing
from
westward
along
the
ridge
which
the
enemy
had
occupied
while
to
our
right
front
some
two
miles
off
more
british
infantry
appeared
on
the
sky
line
showing
that
the
boer
position
had
been
quitted
at
this
period
our
orders
came
for
us
to
retire
from
the
kopje
and
make
our
bivouac
for
the
night
somewhere
on
the
plain
below
june
was
the
day
on
which
we
reached
the
goal
we
had
been
struggling
for
pretoria
at
last
not
fighting
our
way
in
as
anticipated
by
everybody
but
forming
a
peaceful
procession
with
our
baggage
behind
us
news
having
arrived
that
the
governor
had
surrendered
the
town
late
the
previous
night
we
were
not
allowed
to
halt
but
just
passed
through
the
city
and
out
to
irene
a
station
ten
miles
south
of
pretoria
and
on
the
johannesburg
line
which
we
at
present
occupy
the

protecting
the
rail
from

downwards

had

attach

great
towns
as
strategical
bases
with
the
capture

had

all
their
arsenals
and

lines
of

in

hands

all
rules
of
warfare
the
campaign
should
have
ended
then
that
impression
was
certainly
strong
on
the
mind
shortly
before
dusk
of
june
when
colonel
de
lisle
whose
mounted
infantry
had
followed
the
enemy
to
within
yards
of
pretoria
sent
an
officer
under
a
flag
of
truce
to
demand
the
surrender
of
the
town
the
end
might
possibly
have
come
then
if
instead
of
waiting
five
hours
for
a
reply
to
that
summons
and
seven
hours
longer
for
the
unconditional
surrender
which
lord
roberts
insisted
upon
when
tardy
message
reached
him
we
had
risked
everything
in
a
night
attack
on
the
town
but
at
dawn
the
next
morning
botha
sent
a
simple
message
to
say
that
he
was
not
prepared
to
defend
pretoria
further
and
therefore
he
entrusted
the
women
children
and
property
to
his
protection
in
other
words
we
were
quite
at
liberty
to
march
into
a
town
from
which
every
fighting
commando
all
treasure
and
nearly
every
munition
of
war
had
by
that
time
been
safely
removed
one
big
gun
was
still
in
the
station
on
a
train
that
waited
to
take
british
prisoners
away
but
they
had
risen
in
mutiny
at
the
last
moment
and
refused
to
go
wherefore
the
train
went
without
them
its
movements
being
hastened
by
the
sight
of
british
troops
coming
over
the
hills
to
colonel
mounted
infantry
of
which
horse
formed
a
part
was
given
the
honour
of
being
first
to
enter
pretoria
by
the
rustenburg
road
as
the
guards
brigade
of
general
division
marched
in
on
another
side
without
firing
a
shot
so
the
goal
was
reached
but
we
found
it
to
all
intents
and
purposes
a
hollow
triumph
there
had
been
no
surrender
of
the
boer
army
or
of
anything
that
could
weaken
its
power
for
further
resistance
the
cage
was
in
our
hands
but
the
hawk
had
gone
with
wings
unpinioned
every
soldier
probably
felt
as
horse
did
that
any
show
of
triumph
would
have
been
out
of
place
in
the
circumstances
they
took
no
part
even
in
the
ceremonial
parade
when
lord
roberts
made
his
formal
entry
and
the
union
jack
was
hoisted
on
the
raadzaal
that
afternoon
but
had
at
least
the
satisfaction
of
knowing
that
their
services
of
the
previous
day
were
appreciated
by
the
who
in
his
despatches
wrote
i
marched
with
mounted
infantry
four
companies
imperial
yeomanry
division
brigade
and
the
naval
and
siege
guns
to
spruit
both
banks
of
which
were
occupied
by
the
enemy
the
boers
were
quickly
dislodged
from
the
south
bank
by
the
mounted
infantry
and
imperial
yeomanry
and
pursued
for
nearly
a
mile
when
our
troops
came
under
artillery
fire
the
enemy
then
moved
along
a
series
of
ridges
parallel
to
our
main
line
of
advance
with
the
object
of
turning
our
left
flank
but
in
this
they
were
checked
by
the
mounted
infantry
and
imperial
yeomanry
supported
by
brigade

howes
invalided
home
after
the
surrender
of
pretoria
seeing
that
louis
botha
with
all
the
main
body
of
boers
had
retired
eastward
lord
roberts
realised
the
importance
of
making
his
line
of
communications
secure
in
that
direction
and
he
therefore
paid
a
high
compliment
to
the
troops
under
colonel
ross
in
selecting
them
for
that
duty
a
few
days
after
taking
up
the
positions
assigned
to
him
colonel
lumsden
wrote
from
irene
a
letter
in
which
he
expressed
his
opinion
of
the
work
that
had
been
done
by
all
ranks
in
the
corps
under
his
command
we
have
been
told
off
to
hold
the
line
of
communications
from
pretoria
to
johannesburg
a
company
and
headquarters
taking
the
first
ten
miles
b
company
the
second
and
the
remainder
of
the
corps
in
detachments
all
down
the
line
we
are
here
for
an
indefinite
time
awaiting
events
our
maxim
gun
under
captain
holmes
has
rejoined
us
here
having
been
with
general
columns
this
is
a
much
needed
rest
for
all
and
especially
for
our
horses
as
they
are
utterly
unfit
to
do
more
than
a
couple
of
hard
marching
and
i
can
only
put
ninety
mounted
men
including
officers
into
the
field
this
considering
the
corps
landed
with
a
full
complement
of
horses
and
has
since
received
nearly
remounts
will
give
you
an
idea
of
what
we
have
gone
through
and
the
wear
and
tear
our
horses
have
had
through
hard
marching
and
short
feeding
taking
it
as
a
whole
officers
and
men
have
kept
excellent
health
the
only
prevalent
disease
being
dysentery
the
days
are
bright
and
sunny
without
being
hot
at
times
it
is
even
cold
the
nights
however
are
always
bitterly
cold
and
it
is
quite
a
usual
occurrence
on
awaking
to
find
the
grass
covered
with
frost
and
the
water
in
the
frozen
over
this
will
give
you
some
idea
of
the
pleasure
of
sleeping
out
with
only
the
sky
for
a
roof
our
total
casualties
have
amounted
to
ten
per
cent
of
the
force
we
landed
with
and
a
very
large
proportion
of
our
ordinary
fighting
strength
considering
that
the
most
we
have
ever
put
in
the
field
was
and
we
are
now
reduced
to
under
a
hundred
mounted
men
we
have
heard
of
the
release
of
our
prisoners
and
expect
them
to
join
us
in
a
few
days
our
only
casualties
in
this
shape
were
the
seven
taken
on
april
at
ospruit
i
can
not
say
too
much
in
praise
of
the
conduct
of
my
officers
and
men
from
first
to
last
under
many
hardships
and
in
very
trying
circumstances
and
i
feel
sure
they
have
gained
a
name
for
themselves
which
their
many
friends
both
in
england
and
in
india
have
just
cause
to
be
proud
of
i
am
confident
that
my
meed
of
praise
will
be
fully
endorsed
by
those
under
whom
i
and
my
corps
have
had
the
honour
to
serve
it
is
considered
that
the
war
is
virtually
over
and
at
any
rate
i
fancy
all
volunteer
corps
will
be
disbanded
within
a
short
time
i
have
kept
our
accounts
as
nearly
as
possible
up
to
date
but
we
are
unaware
if
any
pay
already
claimed
has
yet
been
placed
to
our
credit
in
cape
town
and
in
the
meantime
troopers
are
receiving
advances
through
this
office
out
of
the
funds
brought
by
me
from
india
fortunately
i
have
been
able
to
cash
cheques
in
the
towns
we
have
passed
through
and
i
hope
i
may
succeed
in
doing
so
at
pretoria
as
our
cash
in
the
box
is
reduced
to
four
sovereigns
we
have
received
no
mails
either
from
england
or
india
for
the
past
six
weeks
and
we
are
all
anxiously
awaiting
news
the
special
correspondent
of
the
whose
close
association
with
the
corps
in
all
circumstances
can
be
traced
through
every
letter
does
not
take
his
banishment
to
lines
of
communication
with
the
stoical
philosophy
that
characterises
colonel
lumsden
after
the
freshness
of
it
has
gone
he
writes
where
horse
have
been
putting
in
time
since
lord
roberts
supplanted
paul
kruger
in
the
jurisdiction
of
the
town
and
in
the
hearts
of
the
people
of
pretoria
irene
is
not
so
called
because
of
any
resemblance
it
bears
to
the
irene
of
the
classics
for
of
all
the
forsaken
places
which
it
has
pleased
providence
to
dot
down
on
this
earth
of
ours
irene
is
the
most
forsaken
perhaps
the
boers
in
their
cunning
calculated
that
by
giving
it
a
name
like
music
its
reproach
in
the
land
might
be
less
the
predominating
feature
of
the
scenery
in
irene
is
the
railway
that
with
rare
persistence
for
a
transvaal
railway
runs
right
through
the
place
in
a
straight
line
the
late
government
of
this
country
knew
a
lot
about
railways
a
crow
might
have
done
the
distance
between
say
bloemfontein
and
pretoria
in
miles
but
it
takes
the
railway
miles
and
each
mile
cost
as
many
hundred
pounds
to
build
the
government
fell
in
with
the
miscalculation
the
railway
is
full
of
curves
elegant
but
unnecessary
and
the
admi
sahib
huzoor
bucksheesh
near
the
station
stood
a
culvert
so
big
that
it
deserved
to
be
called
a
bridge
there
the
boers
had
placed
a
charge
of
dynamite
the
dynamite
went
off
pop
and
the
bridge
the
embankment
a
section
of
the
river
and
a
large
slice
of
the
scenery
became
as
naught
then
as
lord
roberts
swept
north
he
dropped
a
sapper
or
orders
no
need
of
any
but
in
three
days
trains
as
long
as
chowringhee
skipped
over
where
the
bridge
had
been
and
only
the
two
sappers
trembled
for
the
safety
of
their
bag
tricks
no
tommy
ever
doubts
the
inventions
of
a
sapper
and
despite
the
attributed
to
him
tommy
is
a
man
ever
suspicious
of
the
doings
of
his
neighbour
but
everybody
knows
about
sappers
and
their
wonderful
works
hence
it
was
that
horse
went
to
irene
the
powers
that
had
newly
begun
to
be
in
pretoria
said
we
were
to
do
steady
horatio
without
any
theatrical
business
to
that
bridge
while
the
sappers
slung
things
about
and
made
it
after
three
weeks
of
guarding
this
babe
of
the
royal
engineers
the
truth
dawned
upon
horse
that
they
were
on
lines
of
communication
no
place
for
them
thought
they
but
the
authorities
had
their
own
designs
and
horse
were
spread
out
to
such
places
as
zurfontein
kalfontein
oliphantfontein
springs
where
the
railway
had
been
foolish
enough
to
risk
itself
in
the
air
and
endanger
its
existence
thereby
for
the
boers
are
death
and
dynamite
on
everything
in
the
shape
of
a
bridge
however
while
horse
took
care
of
those
places
no
boers
ventured
to
disturb
the
peace
though
they
played
the
devil
with
them
when
we
had
gone
troopers
who
had
not
been
spoilt
by
luxurious
idleness
as
prisoners
of
war
in
pretoria
took
a
less
cynical
view
of
their
situation
at
irene
until
the
monotony
of
it
began
to
depress
them
notwithstanding
their
disappointment
at
having
to
leave
pretoria
behind
them
before
they
had
a
chance
of
discovering
how
illusive
was
its
outward
show
of
plenty
they
soon
became
reconciled
to
the
fate
that
deprived
them
of
a
share
in
the
garrison
duties
which
would
have
seemed
but
a
dull
substitute
for
the
festivities
and
celebrations
that
imagination
had
conjured
up
as
a
natural
sequence
of
a
triumphal
entry
into
the
boer
capital
on
discovering
that
the
surrender
of
pretoria
had
not
brought
peace
appreciably
nearer
the
correspondent
of
the
daily
wrote
quite
cheerfully
we
saw
very
little
of
the
town
as
after
waiting
near
the
racecourse
for
about
two
hours
we
were
much
to
our
disgust
marched
off
to
a
station
called
irene
about
ten
miles
down
the
line
where
we
were
to
be
put
on
lines
of
communication
our
hopes
of
a
bit
of
a
spin
in
the
town
after
the
toilsome
march
up
were
therefore
blasted
and
growling
was
more
or
less
general
naturally
enough
i
think
our
tempers
were
not
improved
by
the
fact
that
the
road
out
was
a
mass
of
dust
which
kept
going
down
our
throats
and
into
our
eyes
till
one
could
hardly
speak
or
see
once
in
camp
and
settled
down
things
wore
a
very
different
appearance
however
irene
is
a
nicely
wooded
place
with
a
beautiful
stream
of
water
running
just
fact
a
perfect
camping
ground
just
close
by
is
situated
the
model
farm
of
the
transvaal
the
grounds
are
very
extensive
and
fruit
and
vegetables
of
all
sorts
are
grown
there
is
also
a
large
enclosure
where
deer
hartebeeste
and
other
animals
run
wild
we
stayed
at
irene
two
days
and
then
the
mounted
infantry
accompanied
by
three
sections
of
b
company
went
on
to
kalfontein
a
station
about
ten
miles
further
south
leaving
a
company
and
no
section
b
company
to
garrison
irene
arriving
at
kalfontein
late
in
the
evening
we
camped
about
a
couple
of
miles
from
the
railway
station
till
next
day
when
our
company
moved
into
the
station
compound
we
parted
with
the
mounted
infantry
here
they
being
sent
to
various
stations
down
the
line
and
sorry
we
were
to
lose
our
old
friends
kaalfontein
railway
station
is
surrounded
by
nice
trees
under
which
we
kept
our
horses
and
made
ourselves
at
home
knowing
that
this
would
be
our
station
for
some
time
we
laid
in
a
stock
of
pots
and
pans
collected
from
the
empty
farmhouses
of
which
there
were
several
in
the
vicinity
and
did
our
cooking
in
style
ducks
geese
and
turkeys
to
say
nothing
of
cocks
and
hens
besides
our
rations
of
mutton
and
beef
kept
us
going
merrily
and
groceries
were
obtainable
from
a
few
storekeepers
who
paid
us
visits
once
a
week
it
was
not
surprising
therefore
that
after
a
month
of
this
sort
of
thing
with
comparatively
light
work
after
the
rough
time
we
had
been
having
on
the
march
up
the
appearance
of
the
men
all
round
improved
considerably
chubby
rosy
cheeks
and
bodies
taking
the
place
of
hollow
features
and
more
or
less
meagre
frames
the
weather
though
bitterly
cold
in
the
nights
and
early
mornings
and
very
warm
as
a
rule
during
the
days
was
thoroughly
enjoyable
and
accounted
in
a
great
measure
no
doubt
for
the
improved
state
of
most
of
the
health
our
work
consists
in
patrolling
the
line
south
of
irene
and
also
the
country
round
on
every
side
and
we
also
supply
men
daily
for
observation
posts
in
various
directions
the
life
we
lead
is
for
the
most
part
a
peaceful
one
though
in
examining
farms
and
scouring
the
country
round
which
we
do
in
parties
of
six
under
an
officer
as
a
rule
there
is
always
the
chance
of
being
potted
by
the
wily
boer
this
has
happened
on
three
occasions
during
our
stay
our
men
being
fired
upon
at
close
range
and
having
to
flee
for
their
lives
none
of
us
was
touched
but
the
bullets
came
pretty
close
most
times
these
small
patrols
by
the
way
are
i
think
the
most
unsatisfactory
part
of
work
looked
at
from
a
personal
point
of
view
one
stands
every
chance
of
being
shot
and
knows
that
immediately
one
is
fired
at
it
is
a
case
of
turning
and
riding
for
dear
life
without
a
chance
of
retaliation
or
at
any
rate
immediate
retaliation
as
the
boers
always
outnumber
us
and
hold
the
positions
on
these
occasions
most
of
the
farms
round
about
kalfontein
are
unoccupied
the
farmers
and
their
families
evidently
having
left
in
haste
only
carrying
away
a
few
necessaries
with
them
but
some
of
their
houses
have
been
left
in
charge
of
the
boer
memsahibs
the
sahibs
having
gone
on
a
expedition
with
the
nearest
commando
or
perhaps
being
commandants
themselves
a
case
in
point
is
that
of
commandant
erasmus
who
has
a
large
farm
about
seven
miles
from
here
where
he
has
left
his
wife
and
five
or
six
comely
daughters
needless
to
say
this
is
a
favourite
patrol
though
the
girls
are
shy
and
retiring
and
the
old
lady
waxes
very
wroth
when
approached
with
a
view
to
doing
a
deal
in
sheep
saying
she
has
only
enough
to
keep
herself
and
family
going
doubtless
including
papa
when
he
pays
them
his
periodical
visit
by
stealth
during
the
night
another
trooper
takes
up
the
narrative
with
a
sigh
of
regret
for
the
things
that
can
not
be
got
at
boer
farms
for
love
or
money
we
are
all
languishing
for
an
iced
whisky
peg
and
a
decent
meal
and
often
wonder
whether
we
shall
enjoy
either
again
our
work
has
been
no
picnic
and
though
we
are
all
as
enthusiastic
over
it
as
ever
i
must
admit
our
experiences
have
been
many
and
hard
we
have
dwindled
down
in
numbers
too
through
casualties
and
sickness
and
our
clothing
is
showing
signs
of
wear
and
tear
the
stage
has
long
since
vanished
and
a
wash
once
a
week
is
a
luxury
some
had
grown
quite
i
might
but
the
colonel
has
a
rooted
antipathy
to
hirsute
growth
on
the
chin
we
have
also
had
some
changes

while

fills

similar
office
at

we
have
been
cut
off
from
our
mails
for
more
than
a
month
and
are
very
anxious
to
see
the
letters
that
have
accumulated
somewhere
for
us
our
doings
i
expect
have
been
telegraphed
to
india
as
they
occurred
for
there
is
a
plethora
of
newspaper
correspondents
following
in
the
wake
of
the
army
and
with
james
represents
the
and
has
been
to
see
his
indian
friends
the
kaffir
we
have
come
in
contact
with
here
is
a
bad
lot
and
he
has
harassed
the
boer
farmers
terribly
during
the
war
being
a
perfect
pindaree
in
his
depredations
he
loots
anything
and
everything
he
can
lay
hands
on
and
shifts
his
allegiance
from
boer
to
british
directly
our
troops
enter
his
province
in
this
respect
the
excuse
he
makes
is
that
since
the
outbreak
of
the
war
the
boers
have
not
troubled
to
pay
their
native
servants
any
wages
while
keeping
them
at
work
as
usual
all
the
volunteers
colonial
and
imperial
receive
and
as
much
as
per
day
while
kaffirs
earn
on
an
average
per
mensem
in
our
employ
it
comes
a
bit
rough
on
us
to
find
our
remuneration
fixed
at
for
rations
per
diem
considering
that
we
mainly
exist
on
private
purchases
of
stores
the
want
of
ready
money
is
a
great
hardship
some
of
our
troopers
have
spent
from
to
a
month
on
groceries
and
smokes
since
our
arrival
in
africa
ten
shillings
for
a
packet
of
cigarettes
has
often
been
willingly
given
while
nobody
would
think
two
shillings
for
a
loaf
of
bread
exorbitant
the
reason
for
these
prices
is
always
that
the
boers
have
commandeered
all
they
could
lay
hands
on
in
their
retreat
since
our
departure
from
bloemfontein
we
have
not
seen
our
tents
our
nightly
shelter
has
been
the
frosty
canopy
of
heaven
and

who

from

until
our
entry
into
pretoria
and
about
whose
fate
some
doubt
existed
for
a
time
was
trooper
clarence
walton
his
gallantry
in
sacrificing
himself
while
attempting
to
save
a
wounded
comrade
was
mentioned
by
colonel
lumsden
as
an
act
of
conspicuous
devotion
on
a
day
when
the
corps
gained
high
credit
and
a
reluctant
rebuke
for
many
brave
deeds
like
others
who
fell
into
the
hands
of
enemies
that
day
he
experienced
nothing
but
kindness
from
his
captors
to
this
he
bears
willing
testimony
in
the
following
letter
starting
from
the
time
of
our
first
action
of
april
when
i
had
the
misfortune
to
be
slightly
wounded
and
taken
prisoner
it
might
be
interesting
to
add
my
experience
of
the
treatment
i
received
to
that
of
the
other
prisoners
after
our
fighting
line
retired
from
my
direction
a
boer
came
down
to
me
and
asked
if
i
was
wounded
i
told
him
i
was
hit
in
the
foot
and
he
offered
to
take
my
boot
and
gaiter
off
for
me
which
i
accepted
he
then
got
a
small
pony
and
helped
me
on
and
took
me
to
a
farm
about
half
a
mile
distant
where
an
english
doctor
on
the
boer
side
attended
to
my
case
immediately
and
then
gave
me
a
jolly
good
meal
better
than
i
had
had
for
some
time
the
following
night
i
was
taken
to
brandfort
hospital
where
i
received
every
kindness
possible
the
nurses
being
exceedingly
attentive
and
the
boers
themselves
far
from
showing
any
came
and
talked
and
gave
me
tobacco
one
lady
cycled
to
her
home
with
the
object
of
getting
some
books
for
me
to
read
but
unfortunately
she
arrived
back
just
too
late
as
we
were
being
placed
in
the
waggon
to
go
to
smaldeel
and
entrain
there
for
pretoria
lieutenant
crane
who
was
also
a
prisoner
travelled
most
of
the
way
in
the
same
waggons
and
train
as
myself
he
was
kind
enough
to
allow
me
to
share
the
little
tobacco
he
had
got
for
which
i
was
exceedingly
grateful
after
reaching
pretoria
i
was
handed
over
to
our
own
people
at
the
hospital
on
the
racecourse
where
although
i
did
not
have
quite
such
a
comfortable
time
as
i
had
had
with
the
boer
ambulances
i
had
nothing
to
complain
of
as
the
british
residents
at
pretoria
did
everything
they
could
for
us
and
we
have
to
thank
them
for
all
the
little
luxuries
they
gave
us
the
food
we
received
from
the
boers
was
sufficient
to
keep
one
alive
and
that
is
about
all
after
pretoria
was
taken
i
found
myself
a
prisoner
of
the
which
i
found
to
be
very
irksome
although
at
pretoria
the
major
in
charge
allowed
us
our
liberty
to
a
great
extent
when
i
got
to
bloemfontein
i
was
fortunate
enough
to
meet
roe
late
doctor
in
assam
who
treated
saunders
and
myself
with
great
kindness
and
did
everything
he
could
to
make
us
comfortable
life
at
irene
was
not
all
unpleasant
several
lively
incidents
brightened
existence
there
and
some
reflex
of
them
comes
to
us
through
the
cheery
words
of
captain
neville
taylor
whose
arduous
duties
as
adjutant
did
not
prevent
him
from
garnering
a
fund
of
merry
anecdotes
here
is
one
after
pretoria
had
been
taken
a
company
and
headquarters
remained
at
irene
and
b
company
went
to
kalfontein
ten
miles
south
on
the
line
the
duties
at
both
places
were
similar
in
that
they
had
to
patrol
the
line
and
the
neighbourhood
one
of
the
irene
regular
patrols
was
to
pretoria
and
back
daily
on
one
of
the
usual
patrols
into
that
town
captain
rutherfoord
passed
a
german
ambulance
proceeding
south
who
explained
that
they
had
been
allowed
to
do
so
but
carried
no
pass
arriving
at
pretoria
he
reported
the
fact
to
the
authorities
and
also
that
he
had
stopped
the
ambulance
until
he
could
get
orders
concerning
it
on
inquiry
having
ascertained
that
nothing
was
known
about
it
he
obtained
a
letter
to
the
commandant
at
irene
who
was
told
to
ascertain
that
the
ambulance
people
were
carrying
no
papers
for
the
use
of
the
enemy
and
if
satisfied
to
allow
them
to
proceed
the
commandant
being
a
man
of
high
ideals
did
not
see
his
way
to
thoroughly
searching
the
ambulance
which
contained
four
german
nurses
in
addition
to
the
four
doctors
and
he
therefore
allowed
them
to
pass
on
having
taken
the
senior
word
of
honour
that
they
had
with
them
nothing
of
any
use
to
the
enemy
in
the
way
of
papers
the
ambulance
then
went
on
its
way
but
stopped
the
night
at
kalfontein
ten
miles
beyond
irene
in
the
evening
a
wire
came
to
us
for
an
patrol
to
bring
all
those
people
back
to
pretoria
captain
rutherfoord
was
accordingly
sent
to
kalfontein
for
the
purpose
and
returned
in
the
evening
with
the
party
colonel
lumsden
and
all
of
us
felt
so
sorry
for
the
prisoners
that
we
decided
to
ask
them
to
dinner
which
invitation
being
accepted
in
due
course
we
all
sat
down
together
in
our
little
during
our
stay
at
irene
as
it
was
bitterly
cold
we
had
run
up
a
small
hut
walls
of
stones
a
tin
roof
and
a
most
cunningly
contrived
fireplace
which
did
not
smoke
we
decorated
the
place
with
flowers
had
a
dinner
and
drank
de
as
our
only
beverage
the
dinner
went
off
in
the
wonderful
way
dinners
do
none
of
us
could
talk
german
and
none
of
them
english
and
yet
we
conversed
freely
and
had
the
greatest
fun
the
show
concluded
with
songs
and
the
last
remembrance
i
have
of
it
was
that
the
colonel
and
the
prettiest
were
taking
down
one
addresses
and
betting
gloves
about
something
in
the
quietest
corner
rutherfoord
had
been
hiding
as
much
as
possible
as
he
felt
himself
to
blame
for
being
the
cause
of
all
their
trouble
but
we
gave
him
away
at
the
end
and
though
they
all
pretended
to
be
very
angry
with
him
we
unanimously
allowed
that
he
had
beaten
all
but
the
colonel
in
winning
the
favours
of
the
fair
sex
at
about
we
escorted
them
back
to
their
caravan
and
said
first
of
all
pointing
out
that
a
sentry
was
posted
over
them
with
orders
to
shoot
at
sight
if
anyone
left
the
waggons
during
the
night
they
started
for
pretoria
at
daybreak
but
most
of
the
officers
were
there
to
see
them
off
while
one
met
them
a
few
miles
up
the
road
the
colonel
was
late
for
breakfast
that
morning
we
heard
afterwards
that
on
arrival
at
pretoria
they
were
searched
and
the
result
was
that
the
doctors
went
to
gaol
and
the
dear
ladies
were
sent
under
supervision
out
of
the
country
we
all
however
are
quite
certain
that
they
were
innocent
victims
of
boer
duplicity
another
story
is
very
characteristic
of
smartness
at
one
of
the
think
party
of
us
got
leave
to
go
into
the
town
for
dinner
we
had
come
in
late
and
either
had
not
been
given
or
had
forgotten
the
countersign
near
the
town
we
came
upon
a
sentry
who
challenged
in
the
usual
way
and
who
let
us
through
after
making
certain
that
we
were
officers
of
horse
after
going
a
few
yards
we
heard
him
say
to
his
pal
that
it
was
all
right
as
we
were
only
of
those
volunteers
this
being
meant
in
all
politeness
and
only
one
officer
of
ours
however
threatened
to
report
him
if
he
talked
like
that
again
after
a
good
dinner
we
were
returning
to
camp
and
came
upon
the
same
sentry
who
goes
there
one
and
give
the
one
officer
advancing
said
tommy
shouldered
with
a
slap
and
roared
out
volunteer
and
well
he
had
the
best
of
us
and
we
laughed
as
much
as
the
guard
about
this
time
the
boers
in
pretoria
were
also
making
merry
over
an
incident
associated
with
countersigns
in
which
one
who
played
a
part
had
the
laugh
on
his
side
at
the
expense
of
british
officers
it
happened
at
a
crisis
when
botha
was
known
to
have
secret
emissaries
in
the
capital
warning
him
of
every
preparation
for
a
fresh
movement
and
it
illustrates
perfectly
the
aptitude
of
boers
as
spies
and
the
inefficiency
of
our
own
precaution
against
traitors
a
young
boer
speaking
english
fluently
came
from
force
just
after
lord
roberts
was
supposed
to
have
dispersed
it
in
the
neighbourhood
of
diamond
hill
he
reached
our
outposts
not
far
from
the
limits
patrolled
by
horse
and
being
armed
with
one
of
the
passes
that
have
been
lavishly
distributed
and
frequently
abused
he
had
no
difficulty
in
getting
through
the
british
lines
once
inside
them
he
was
free
to
move
about
anywhere
and
ascertain
that
nearly
all
available
troops
except
one
division
had
been
withdrawn
from
pretoria
for
concentration
elsewhere
he
even
loitered
about
to
hear
the
talk
at
a
club
frequented
by
officers
and
by
civilians
whose
privileges
of
membership
nobody
assumed
the
right
to
question
there
and
in
hotel
halls
or
where
officers
regardless
of
attentive
listeners
incautiously
spoke
of
their
own
probable
movements
this
young
boer
picked
up
much
entertaining
gossip
and
useful
information
but
he
also
learned
to
his
dismay
that
nobody
could
move
about
the
town
or
leave
it
after
nightfall
without
the
countersign
his
idea
was
to
get
out
again
under
cover
of
darkness
with
all
the
news
that
he
could
gather
for
general
botha
but
he
heard
that
provisional
police
would
by
that
time
be
patrolling
all
the
streets
alert
and
zealous
in
the
performance
of
their
new
duties
and
also
that
every
outlet
by
which
a
horseman
could
pass
would
have
double
sentries
posted
after
sunset
a
wary
boer
never
tries
rash
experiments
if
he
can
avoid
them
and
this
young
man
having
no
unpatriotic
wish
to
run
his
head
into
a
noose
adopted
other
measures
going
to
a
house
in
which
some
british
uniforms
were
kept
as
trophies
until
the
police
discovered
and
appropriated
them
he
dressed
in
khaki
donned
a
greatcoat
and
armed
himself
with
a
mauser
carbine
all
this
may
seem
impossible
in
a
town
under
martial
law
but
arms
and
ammunition
were
found
in
private
houses
long
after
the
date
of
this
incident
and
nobody
ever
heard
of
exemplary
punishment
being
meted
out
to
offenders
who
generally
got
off
scot
free
on
a
plea
of
ignorance
at
any
rate
the
young
boer
thus
equipped
to
counterfeit
a
provisional
policeman
sallied
forth
at
night
when
a
high
collar
turned
well
up
for
protection
against
the
icy
north
wind
and
a
hat
slouched
over
the
eyes
would
not
have
attracted
any
attention
making
use
of
mental
notes
previously
taken
he
placed
himself
near
the
corner
of
a
street
so
much
frequented
by
officers
on
their
way
to
or
from
the
club
that
special
police
seldom
troubled
to
look
after
it
there
he
had
not
long
to
wait
for
a
chance
of
challenging
and
in
response
the
countersign
was
given
as
a
matter
of
course
without
the
least
suspicion
safe
in
the
possession
of
this
password
the
ingenious
young
boer
mounted
his
horse
and
claiming
to
be
the
bearer
of
despatches
rode
past
our
outlying
pickets
and
off
into
the
darkness
on
his
way
to
the
nearest
boer
commando
some
officers
of
horse
were
in
the
pretoria
club
that
night
but
it
was
not
they
who
gave
away
the
countersign
occasional
visits
to
pretoria
in
the
vain
hope
of
finding
that
some
articles
of
luxury
or
outfit
could
be
bought
there
became
great
events
in
the
lives
of
both
officers
and
men
during
their
banishment
to
lines
of
communication
somehow
a
goodly
number
of
them
for
whom
sport
was
an
irresistible
attraction
managed
to
assemble
on
ground
a
mile
outside
the
racecourse
when
three
score
of
competitors
started
for
the
first
military
steeplechase
ever
ridden
near
pretoria
after
this
event
colonel
lumsden
wrote
with
pardonable
pride
beharis
will
be
pleased
to
hear
that
captain
rutherfoord
of
ours
won
the
first
in
pretoria
there
were
sixty
starters
over
a
stiff
country
with
the
result
that
grief
was
plentiful
but
that
view
of
the
result
though
entertained
by
nearly
every
spectator
who
was
near
enough
to
watch
an
exciting
finish
did
not
commend
itself
to
the
official
whose
decision
none
could
question
how
it
all
came
about
may
be
told
by
an
who
was
also
a
competitor
until
finding
himself
hopelessly
out
of
the
race
he
took
to
and
finally
joined
a
crowd
of
onlookers
at
the
the
german
staff
officer
who
said
that
english
soldiers
went
into
a
fight
as
if
it
were
sport
and
took
their
sport
seriously
as
training
for
battle
must
have
been
thinking
of
some
scene
like
that
in
which
british
officers
and
volunteers
of
all
ranks
figured
on
pretoria
racecourse
that
last
saturday
in
june
there
we
were
in
the
midst
of
war
with
an
active
enemy
not
many
miles
off
yet
nobody
seemed
to
concern
himself
much
about
what
the
boers
might
be
doing
at
that
moment
all
were
intent
upon
the
important
business
in
hand
a
had
to
be
run
and
every
man
meant
to
do
his
best
whether
mounted
on
a
basuto
pony
that
had
never
jumped
any
obstacle
more
formidable
than
a
boggy
spruit
before
or
on
a
raking
waler
or
clever
english
hunter
lord
roberts
had
given
permission
for
a
and
theoretically
the
sport
took
that
form
there
were
no
prizes
for
winners
no
clerk
of
the
scales
no
no
penalties
for
infringement
of
hunt
club
rules
all
who
cared
to
start
might
enjoy
that
privilege
but
practically
the
thing
resolved
itself
into
a
under
regulations
that
forbade
riding
from
point
to
point
at
discretion
a
course
being
marked
by
flags
round
which
every
starter
was
compelled
to
go
or
lose
his
chance
of
distinction
would
have
been
play
in
a
country
like
this
unless
it
had
led
us
over
rough
kopjes
and
away
across
the
veldt
where
there
might
have
been
a
chance
of
boer
patrols
chipping
in
so
to
add
some
touch
of
excitement
and
the
spice
of
danger
without
which
no
british
sport
is
worthy
of
that
name
artificial
fences
were
made
more
difficult
to
negotiate
than
spruits
or
boggy
two
stone
walls
enclosing
a
mealie
patch
came
handy
and
suggested
themselves
as
most
appropriate
for
a
start
where
spectators
might
see
some
fun
at
the
outset
if
veldt
ponies
tried
to
tumble
over
as
they
generally
do
without
jumping
a
run
without
as
an
accompaniment
did
not
commend
itself
to
the
immortal
jorrocks
whose
eulogy
of
the
image
of
war
without
its
guilt
and
only
per
cent
of
its
danger
would
have
been
considerably
modified
in
application
to
such
sport
as
ours
of
that
day
if
that
genial
could
have
seen
the
horses
some
men
chose
to
risk
their
necks
on
they
were
of
all
sizes
shapes
and
breeds
as
for
the
fences
an
irish
hunter
would
have
larked
over
every
one
in
his
stride
but
it
is
quite
another
thing
with
horses
that
have
never
been
trained
to
leap

bourne
captain
rutherfoord
pretoria
did
not
give
itself
away
all
at
once
to
the
temptations
of
a
novel
spectacle
but
there
were
ladies
in
carriages
among
the
little
crowd
of
sightseers
and
some
stolid
burghers
looked
on
with
approval
while
others
took
part
in
the
chase

boers

a
bond
of
sympathy
with
us
in
love
of
and
field
sports
the
came
sitting
his
shapely
chestnut
with
a
firmer
and
more
workmanlike
ease
than
half
the
horsemen
present
could
boast
of
and
looking
as
if
he
could
still
show
them
all
the
way
over
a
stiff
hunting
country
his
appearance
at
the
was
a
signal
for
marshalling
the
forces
into
line
then
a
staff
officer
gave
the
word
to
go
and
away
went
the
motley
field
more
than
half
a
hundred
strong
spurring
hustling
charging
like
a
cavalry
squadron
for
all
they
were
worth
a
who
served
with
distinction
in
her
navy
years
ago
was
quickest
off
and
led
them
over
the
two
stone
walls
closely
followed
by
captain
cox
of
the
new
south
wales
lancers
then
came
the
second
flight
riding
for
the
walls
knee
to
knee
thanks
to
bold
hearts
and
resolute
riding
they
all
got
over
a
fall
in
that
dense
formation
with
another
rank
rushing
close
behind
would
have
brought
more
than
one
rider
to
unutterable
grief
but
the
ranks
began
to
thin
where
a
spruit
had
to
be
crossed
with
steep
banks
into
and
out
of
the
drift
there
the
pony
with
speed
unchecked
gained
a
good
lead
but
he
came
down
at
the
next
fence
and
gave
his
rider
a
nasty
fall
the
active
however
nipped
into
the
saddle
and
went
on
cheery
as
ever
then
in
clouds
of
dust
through
which
the
fences
could
scarcely
be
seen
leggy
horses
and
diminutive
ponies
rushed
onward
jostling
for
a
lead
as
before
captain
mcneil
of
scouts
came
down
and
broke
his
and
gibbs
of
the
somerset
yeomanry
falling
with
his
horse
on
top
of
him
had
two
ribs
broken
but
still
chase
went
sweeping
heedless
over
a
wide
with
a
hurdle
to
screen
it
and
a
trappy
ditch
where
the
road
had
to
be
crossed
then
they
spread
out
to
gallop
over
stony
ground
for
the
spruit
into
which
many
floundered
the
pace
was
beginning
to
tell
on
horses
out
of
condition
as
they
struggled
up
hill
to
go
for
a
formidable
bank
of
sandbags
topped
with
loose
earth
that
had
been
dug
out
of
the
ditch
in
front
again
to
a
hollow
where
the
little
stream
meandering
between
boggy
ground
had
to
be
crossed
three
times
there
several
jaded
steeds
came
to
a
standstill
having
shot
their
bolts
and
only
a
select
few
went
up
the
next
hill
to
the
trappiest
fence
of
all
where
water
flowed
between
deep
banks
there
the
got
his
third
fall
but
he
mounted
again
and
followed
the
leaders
as
they
rounded
the
flag
and
rode
for
home
captain
cox
had
also
been
left
behind
and
the
running
was
taken
up
by
captain
rutherfoord
of
horse
with
major
kenna
of
the
lancers
in
close
attendance
flanks
were
heaving
and
pipes
wheezing
before
the
next
ridge
had
been
crossed
run
is
nothing
without
music
said
a
subaltern
as
he
roused
his
panting
steed
for
another
effort
he
nearly
blundered
as
many
others
did
over
the
next
little
fence
and
they
were
being
left
hopelessly
behind
kenna
and
rutherfoord
charged
the
last
stone
wall
side
by
side
and
rose
together
at
it
rutherfoord
landed
first
and
had
the
race
in
hand
but
mistaking
the
post
eased
his
horse
too
soon
so
kenna
got
a
neck
ahead
in
the
straight
run
home
and
thus
won
his
right
to
claim
the
brush
or
whatever
may
be
a
substitute
for
it
in
that
was
the
official
verdict
but
horse
still
hold
that
their
champion
was
first
past
the
post
one
day
a
pleasant
incident
enlivened
colonel
ordinarily
uneventful
round
of
inspections
he
had
been
visiting
posts
south
of
irene
and
was
hurrying
back
to
headquarters
on
an
affair
of
urgent
importance
when
a
train
stopped
at
one
of
the
sidings
before
he
had
time
to
realise
that
it
was
a
special
or
to
make
any
inquiries
the
train
began
to
move
again
so
he
jumped
on
to
the
nearest
platform
and
presently
found
himself
in
a
corridor
cleaner
and
more
carefully
looked
after
than
any
he
had
seen
on
a
transvaal
railway
up
to
that
time
not
knowing
what
to
make
of
it
and
to
meet
an
angry
chief
of
the
staff
face
to
face
he
refrained
from
exploring
further
presently
a
lady
passed
and
said
you
come
in
colonel
lumsden
was
smoking
at
the
time
and
declined
for
that
reason
mother
wishes
you
to
come
was
the
reply
so
the
gallant
colonel
yielded
with
ready
grace
and
found
himself
in
the
presence
of
lady
roberts
who
with
her
daughters
was
on
the
way
to
pretoria
they
were
just
then
nearing
irene
and
colonel
lumsden
drew
attention
to
the
camp
of
his
indian
volunteers
in
whom
he
thought
lady
roberts
would
naturally
be
much
interested
to
his
surprise
he
saw
a
huge
bonfire
burning
and
in
silhouette
against
it
were
the
words
to
lady
roberts
stephens
had
hit
upon
this
happy
idea
and
put
it
into
execution
just
at
the
right
moment
one
of
the
daughters
seeing
it
said
mother
there
is
a
warm
welcome
for
you
at
any
rate
lady
roberts
frequently
referred
to
this
impromptu
welcome
in
conversation
with
colonel
lumsden
afterwards
and
spoke
appreciatively
of
the
pleasure
it
had
given
her
for
nearly
two
the
fall
of
pretoria
on
june
to
july
horse
were
scattered
up
and
down
the
railway
lines
between
pretoria
and
johannesburg
colonel
lumsden
gives
the
following
official
account
of
this
period
in
a
letter
to
the
executive
committee
of
his
corps
my
headquarters
are
still
at
irene
while
my
corps
is
stationed
in
detachments
along
the
railway
from
here
to
springs
i
am
daily
expecting
an
order
to
concentrate
either
here
or
at
the
latter
point
having
received
official
information
that
we
are
to
be
relieved
by
mounted
infantry
from
the
regulars
beyond
living
in
a
constant
state
of
alarm
standing
to
arms
at
all
hours
of
the
night
and
our
patrols
shooting
and
being
shot
at
there
is
little
or
nothing
of
interest
to
record
scouting
parties
have
had
several
narrow
escapes
but
nothing
of
a
serious
nature
occurred
until
yesterday
july
when
i
heard
by
wire
from
captain
beresford
at
springs
that
private
claude
walton
of
the
mysore
detachment
had
been
wounded
rather
severely
while
out
on
patrol
with
captain
clifford
but
without
i
understand
endangering
his
life
the
shot
was
fired
from
a
farmhouse
which
has
since
i
am
glad
to
say
been
burnt
to
the
ground
two
days
previously
when
i
was
on
a
visit
to
springs
captain
chamney
and
his
patrol
had
rather
a
narrow
squeak
but
got
safely
away
under
a
pelting
fire
the
boer
outposts
are
within
four
to
five
miles
of
our
position
at
springs
where
colonel
ross
and
part
of
his
corps
are
stationed
but
they
are
too
weak
to
take
the
initiative
the
weather
is
still
bitterly
cold
at
night
but
the
men
have
now
had
time
to
rig
up
temporary
shelters
of
sorts
while
the
detachments
at
zurfontein
and
springs
have
been
fortunate
in
obtaining
shelters
to
live
in
i
much
regret
to
have
to
inform
you
of
the
death
of
private
follett
of
the
mysore
detachment
from
enteric
fever
in
hospital
at
johannesburg
on
the
and
that
the
undernamed
have
been
left
at
various
hospitals
on
the
march
up
sick
or
sent
down
from
here
some
may
return
to
headquarters
but
i
anticipate
that
most
of
them
will
proceed
to
england
or
to
india
invalided
or
convalescent
young
brother
was
fortunately
with
him
at
the
last
and
it
is
gratifying
to
note
that
the
rites
usually
accorded
to
an
officer
were
observed
at
his
interment
the
men
in
the
attached
list
have
mostly
received
their
regimental
pay
up
to
date
and
i
have
done
my
best
to
see
that
any
balance
due
to
them
in
this
respect
will
be
paid
before
they
leave
cape
town
i
have
also
given
in
such
cases
five
pounds
to
each
man
for
necessaries
on
the
voyage
this
responsibility
i
have
taken
on
myself
having
ample
funds
in
hand
and
i
feel
sure
the
committee
will
approve
my
action
more
especially
as
many
men
are
utterly
unable
to
get
into
communication
with
their
friends
and
are
entirely
without
money
i
understand
government
intends
to
grant
this
amount
to
each
soldier
as
a
war
gratuity
at
the
close
of
the
campaign

thus
given

he
captured
and
burnt
a
train
containing
with
precious
letters
for
horse
the
enemy
began
to
press
on
every
weak
point
they
could
find
they
evinced
especially
a
desire
to
get
possession
of
the
mines
near
springs
being
not
only
bent
on
wanton
destruction
but
also
impelled
thereto
by
the
fact
that
supply
officers
there
had
been
gathering
stores
of
forage
from
the
country
round
about
apart
from
its
position
in
the
centre
of
a
district
richly
mineralised
springs
was
of
considerable
strategic
importance
as
a
stronghold
for
the
protection
of
the
railway
junction
at
elandsfontein
to
which
its
commanding
kopjes
if
strongly
held
were
a
formidable
flanking
defence
nothing
but
the
belief
that
forces
had
been
so
scattered
and
demoralised
by
defeat
at
diamond
hill
as
to
be
incapable
of
great
offensive
movements
could
have
induced
the
military
authorities
to
neglect
an
adequate
defence
of
springs
the
boers
seemed
to
realise
its
importance
more
than
we
did
and
if
they
had
brought
artillery
to
bear
upon
it
the
safety
of
johannesburg
might
have
been
seriously
threatened
fortunately
however
either
irresolution
or
divided
counsels
among
his
colleagues
led
to
the
abandonment
of
such
enterprises
after
one
or
two
attempts
which
were
frustrated
by
general
hutton
and
colonel
henry
whose
mounted
infantry
reconnaissances
at
this
juncture
were
characterised
by
great
skill
nevertheless
some
strong
boer
commandos
were
persistent
in
their
attempts
to
get
a
footing
at
springs
so
that
horse
had
to
reinforce
other
corps
of
the
mounted
infantry
and
take
their
full
share
of
outpost
work
in
which
they
were
frequently
harassed
by
the
enemy
some
interesting
details
of
this
phase
are
furnished
by
troopers
whose
letters
were
published
in
the
indian
newspapers
one
correspondent
writes
to
the
daily
news
dating
from
springs
july
you
will
see
from
the
above
that
we
have
been
moved
again
and
i
fancy
we
shall
be
kept
on
the
go
now
for
some
time
to
come
as
both
we
and
our
horses
have
had
a
long
rest
and
are
quite
fit
again
it
was
rather
a
bore
getting
shifted
out
of
our
comfortable
quarters
at
kalfontein
but
now
that
the
wrench
is
over
i
fancy
most
of
us
are
glad
to
be
on
the
march
once
more
as
life
there
was
beginning
to
get
just
a
trifle
monotonous
and
humdrum
about
a
week
previous
to
our
leaving
kalfontein
no
section
b
company
who
had
been
left
at
irene
with
a
company
were
sent
to
garrison
zurfontein
a
few
miles
down
the
line
and
we
joined
them
there
the
whole
of
us
then
marching
to
this
place
which
is
the
terminus
of
a
branch
of
the
main
line
running
eastward
and
is
situated
about
miles
from
johannesburg
i
should
have
mentioned
that
we
left
a
few
of
our
men
at
kalfontein
to
help
to
garrison
the
place
until
further
orders
we
stayed
at
elandsfontein
and
boksburg
on
the
way
here
and
the
men
who
had
been
through
such
exciting
scenes
so
recently
in
these
places
naturally
took
a
great
interest
in
them
and
their
battles
we
have
had
rather
an
exciting
time
of
it
on
two
occasions
since
being
quartered
here
on
the
inst
we
sent
out
a
patrol
of
six
men
under
captain
chamney
and
just
as
they
got
to
the
top
of
a
bit
of
rising
ground
they
found
themselves
within
a
few
hundred
yards
of
an
approaching
body
of
the
enemy
who
no
sooner
saw
our
men
than
they
let
have
it
with
their
mausers
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
turn
and
get
away
as
quickly
as
possible
and
this
the
patrol
did
managing
once
again
to
elude
the
bullets
the
boers
followed
but
soon
gave
up
the
game
as
it
was
only
a
few
miles
from
the
town
and
they
evidently
did
not
consider
it
good
enough
to
venture
too
close
on
getting
out
of
range
and
up
to
the
next
rise
our
patrol
halted
and
sent
a
man
back
to
report
matters
to
colonel
ross
and
after
staying
out
about
an
hour
to
see
if
there
were
any
more
signs
of
the
enemy
they
returned
to
camp
a
larger
patrol
was
sent
out
during
the
day
but
saw
no
signs
of
boers
these
gentry
evidently
having
returned
to
the
adjacent
hills
a
small
farmhouse
from
behind
which
our
men
were
shot
at
was
burnt
down
but
this
did
not
have
much
effect
as
another
of
our
patrols
was
fired
on
two
days
afterwards
near
the
same
place
and
this
time
we
were
not
so
fortunate
as
private
walton
of
no
section
b
company
was
shot
through
the
right
thigh
and
got
another
bullet
through
his
hat
just
shaving
his
skull
he
managed
to
ride
into
camp
with
the
others
but
will
have
a
long
spell
in
hospital
i
fancy
his
wound
was
dressed
as
soon
as
he
got
into
camp
and
next
day
he
was
sent
on
to
johannesburg
this
is
one
of
the
coldest
places
we
have
struck
so
far
and
early
morning
patrols
and
night
pickets
are
consequently
more
unpopular
than
ever
there
is
one
great
consolation
however
and
that
is
we
can
get
good
and
cheap
draught
beer
here
this
is
a
luxury
we
have
not
indulged
in
for
ages
so
needless
to
say
the
thirsty
ones
are
having
a
great
time
the
special
correspondent
of
the
treats
one
of
the
incidents
above
referred
to
in
a
lighter
vein
in
the
middle
of
july
our
detachment
at
springs
where
there
had
been
a
good
deal
of
desultory
fighting
had
some
fun
for
their
money
they
went
out
patrolling
one
day
a
dozen
or
so
strong
a
farmhouse
loomed
in
the
distance
and
as
the
magnetic
pole
draws
the
needle
so
did
this
innocent
nestling
farm
draw
the
patrol
if
you
live
on
biscuits
for
a
month
you
develop
a
craving
for
bread
same
with
everybody
from
general
down
to
it
would
be
side
on
the
part
of
horse
to
hold
aloof
from
any
popular
taste
and
as
one
tea
planter
said
he
smelt
dough
the
patrol
rode
for
that
farmhouse
animated
by
the
noble
sentiment
that
the
devil
might
take
the
hindmost
but
this
time
the
devil
nearly
copped
the
leader
for
the
boers
opened
at
short
range
from
stone
walls
near
the
farmhouse
a
duty
being
to
locate
the
enemy
and
not
to
die
valorously
or
otherwise
our
men
turned
tail
thought
of
their
misdeeds
and
streaked
for
home
unluckily
walton
of
b
company
bestrode
an
argentine
which
feared
neither
boer
nor
bullet
the
brute
budge
under
the
fire
and
walton
received
a
hail
of
lead
all
to
himself
one
bullet
struck
his
hat
cutting
the
bottom
of
the
squashed
cashmere
away
shedding
his
hair
in
a
way
that
no
brushing
will
alter
for
it
shaved
a
line
clean
along
his
scalp
just
as
he
got
his
horse
on
the
move
he
was
struck
again
in
the
thigh
but
managed
to
gallop
away
without
further
mishap
examination
proved
that
the
bullet
had
gone
right
through
the
upper
part
of
his
leg
inflicting
a
severe
but
not
dangerous
wound
walton
is
now
in
hospital
and
doing
well
fuller
details
and
a
more
consecutive
narrative
of
other
events
are
given
by
a
correspondent
of
the
daily
mail
who
writes
our
duties
are
not
only
to
guard
the
station
and
railway
line
and
patrol
the
country
but
also
to
furnish
observation
posts
whose
duty
it
is
to
report
the
movements
of
any
bodies
of
men

may
see

production
of

may
meet
the
boers
are
not
far
off
and
life
is
not
without
its
excitement
for
on
two
occasions
our
patrols
have
been
fired
on
once
getting
a
particularly
hot
reception
and
being
chased
for
a
considerable
distance
one
man
in
particular
had
a
narrow
escape
when
the
were
lying
in
wait
for
the
charged
down
over
the
top
of
a
neighbouring
ridge
he
was
in
the
middle
of
a
small
copse
ahead
of
his
companions
and
did
not
see
the
boers
who
galloped
round
on
each
flank
of
the
wood
and
dismounting
just
this
side
of
it
commenced
firing
at
the
rest
of
the
patrol
hearing
the
rifles
so
close
he
attempted
to
return
and
found
on
getting
to
the
edge
of
the
wood
that
he
was
cut
off
by
a
line
of
men
along
a
wire
fence
who
fortunately
were
so
busy
firing
that
they
did
not
see
him
he
eventually
made
a
dash
for
it
from
the
upper
end
of
the
wood
coming
out
behind
the
boers
and
making
a
long
detour
of
course
directly
he
got
clear
of
the
wood
he
was
seen
and
became
a
target
for
all
their
rifles
but
he
got
safely
away
during
a
prolonged
stay
in
a
place
like
this
we
manage
to
make
ourselves
very
comfortable
in
the
vicinity
of
kaalfontein
the
farmhouses
were
for
the
most
part
deserted
and
had
been
left
just
as
they
stood
from
these
farmhouses
we
are
always
allowed
to
help
ourselves
to
useful
and
articles
such
as
cooking
utensils
and
eatables
so
what
with
chickens
ducks
while
the

excellent

issued
as
rations

to
mention
an
occasional
porker
bought
from
the
kaffirs
or
haunch
of
venison

by
one
of
the
officers
our
larder
was
well
stocked
while
extras
in
the
way
of
groceries
could
be
obtained
from
an
enterprising
jew
storekeeper
who
would
drive
round
with
his
stores

bivouacs

shelters
of

be
rigged

welcome

with
four
companies
of

and
the
canadians
we
remained
six
days
here
the
boers
were
rather
closer
than
they
had
been
at
kaalfontein
and
it
was
the
rule
rather
than
the
exception
for
the
patrols
to
be
fired
on
one
morning
our
patrol
was
shot
at
from
a
farmhouse

white
flag

being
only
yards
distant

a
bullet
through
his
thigh
and
another
right
through
the
crown
of
his
hat
actually
cutting
the
hair
along
the
top
of
his
head
but
he
managed
to
get
away
without
further
injury
on
receiving
the
news
colonel
ross
immediately
sent
out
a
strong
patrol
with
a
and
burnt
the
house
to
the
ground
but
saw
nothing
of
the
enemy
who
are
always
careful
not
to
interfere
with
a
strong
patrol
their
plan
being
to
allow
a
small
party
to
approach
their
ambush
and
then
suddenly
open
fire
hoping
to
empty
a
few
saddles
fortunately
however
it
is
not
easy
to
hit
a
man
on
horseback
at
an
unknown
range
or
else
the
boers
are
uncommonly
bad
shots
for
our
patrols
have
now
been
fired
upon
on
seven
or
eight
different
occasions
at
comparatively
close
range
and
only
one
man
has
been
hit
one
afternoon
a
party
of
boers
about
thirty
in
number
were
seen
by
the
man
coming
down
to
a
kaffir
kraal
about
three
miles
out
horse
were
ordered
to
saddle
up
immediately
and
give
chase
the
boers
however
did
not
wait
they
had
evidently
come
down
to
get
mealies
from
the
kaffirs
as
we
found
some
bags
they
had
dropped
in
their
haste
illustration
a
typical
boer
a
sketch
by
in
these
operations
horse
learned
a
great
deal
about
the
tricks
and
methods
of
boer
scouts
and
soon
began
to
realise
that
these
could
best
be
met
by
bringing
all
a
varied
experiences
into
play
in
reality
the
wily
boers
do
not
send
out
patrols
according
to
our
interpretation
of
that
word
when
any
considerable
number
of
them
are
seen
together
it
may
be
taken
for
granted
that
their
scouts
have
previously
done
all
the
work
expected
of
them
or
that
they
are
off
somewhere
in
another
direction
acting
as
a
screen
for
some
more
important
movement
when
watching
a
hostile
force
with
a
view
to
aggressive
tactics
or
defensive
measures
the
boers
hardly
ever
show
themselves
if
caught
by
chance
on
the
move
they
either
halt
where
they
are
and
lie
down
or
steal
away
one
by
one
to
the
nearest
cover
knowing
perfectly
well
that
any
large
body
moving
can
be
seen
a
long
distance
off
while
separate
figures
become
almost
invisible
dots
on
the
vast
plain
and
attract
no
attention
from
people
whose
eyesight
is
less
keen
than
a
once
concealed
from
view
they
are
careful
not
to
show
themselves
again
on
the
or
on
a
sunlit
slope
where
their
shadows
would
betray
them
from
hunting
wild
game
they
have
learned
to
pursue
the
tactics
of
an
antelope
or
a
haartebeeste
in
eluding
a
vigilant
enemy
as
a
herd
of
deer
browsing
peacefully
in
some
hollow
leaves
a
trusty
sentinel
on
the
nearest
hill
to
keep
watch
so
boers
tell
off
one
of
their
number
for
a
similar
duty
and
he
like
the
sentinel
buck
remains
motionless
beside
a
tree
or
stone
invisible
himself
but
allowing
no
movement
on
the
plain
to
escape

watchful
eye
the
man
on
whom
this
task
falls

generally
a
veteran
trained
by
long
experience
to
a
knowledge
of
the
veldt
and
the
habits
of
every
being
man
or
beast
frequenting
it
by
the
actions
of
horses
or
cattle
on
the
pastures
not
less
than
by
the
hurried
movement
of
more
timid
wild
animals
or
birds
he
knows
whether
they
have
been
disturbed
by
anything
unusual
then
he
stoops
down
to
listen
and
his
ears
are
so
sensitive
by
long
practice
that
he
can
distinguish
the
rumble
of
wheels
or
tread
of
marching
men
miles
off
though
the
sound
comes
to
him
no
louder
than
the
whisper
of
wind
among
dry
grass
and
a
bird
on
the
wing
or
animal
scuttling
through
the
undergrowth
will
warn
him
at
once
of
approaching
foes
illustration
captain
clifford
if
the
boers
want
to
lay
an
ambush
they
do
not
set
about
it
in
a
clumsy
fashion
but
with
due
foresight
calculating
all
the
chances
far
in
advance
of
the
trap
thus
prepared
they
will
probably
have
posted
some
men
among
the
rocks
of
a
kopje
or
preferably
in
a
dry
donga
between
high
banks
that
effectually
conceal
any
movement
these
advanced
scouts
never
show
themselves
or
fire
a
shot
when
the
prey
for
which
their
comrades
are
waiting
approaches
they
simply
allow
it
to
pass
and
then
perhaps
will
be
heard
a
whistle
like
that
of
some
wild
bird
the
lowing
of
cattle
that
can
not
be
seen
or
other
sound
familiar
enough
but
conveying
no
particular
meaning
at
the
moment
yet
in
all
probability
it
is
a
preconcerted
signal
from
the
foremost
scouts
to
others
within
hearing
who
pass
on
the
message
so
that
every
movement
of
the
coming
patrol
or
column
is
known
to
the
boers
waiting
in
ambush
for
it
thus
many
mishaps
have
occurred
in
a
way
that
nobody
could
account
for
and
by
practising
similar
methods
horse
at
length
became
a
match
for
their
enemy
at
the
same
game
other
lessons
than
those
learned
at
springs
were
however
needed
to
perfect
them
in
the
craft

which
the

of
an
army
may
sometimes
depend

such
experience
fell
to
their
share

in
the
day
july
with
a
patrol
of
fifteen
men
in
the
same
direction
overtaking
this
party
about
noon
colonel
ross
ordered
captain
clifford
to
push
on
and
ascertain
that
the
ground
was
clear
of
the
enemy
as
far
as
the
river
colonel
party
then
returned
to
irene
late
in
the
evening
captain
patrol
came
back
and
reported
that
his
party
had
been
ambuscaded
before
reaching
the
river
and
had
had
to
make
the
best
of
their
way
out
of
a
tight
place
on
jaded
horses
at
the
best
speed
they
could
leaving
two
of
their
number
privates
bearne
and
cayley
in
the
hands
of
the
enemy
captain
clifford
estimated
the
strength
at
and
reported
that
as
far
as
he
could
ascertain
they
were
laagered
in
a
strong
natural
position
near
six
mile
spruit
commanding
a
perfect
view
of
its
valley
not
being
quite
satisfied
with
the
information
colonel
ross
ordered
him
to
proceed
again
next
day
with
a
patrol
of
thirty
captain
sidey
accompanied
him
the
task
was
a
difficult
and
dangerous
one
for
although
the
first
twelve
miles
were
clear
of
the
enemy
and
comparatively
open
the
last
eight
miles
of
the
journey
led
down
the
valley
of
six
mile
spruit
with
high
hills
to
the
right
and
lower
ones
to
the
left
the
laager
being
situated
about
down
on
the
right
the
boers
had
thus
the
option
of
stopping
the
patrol
on
the
way
down
or
cutting
it
off
on
the
return
journey
the
reconnoitring
party
could
reach
the
crocodile
river
in
comparative
safety
by
advancing
along
the
higher
ground
to
the
left
of
the
valley
and
holding
the
commanding
posts
as
far
as
numbers
permitted
but
as
this
course
failed
to
draw
out
the
boers
it
was
useless
as
a
method
of
discovering
their
strength
and
whereabouts
captain
clifford
therefore
effected
a
compromise
reached
the
river
as
above
described
and
when
about
through
the
valley
on
the
return
journey
turned
off
in
the
direction
of
the
boer
laager
leaving
sergeant
mitchell
and
four
men
in
observation
on
high
ground
to
cover
his
advance
as
soon
as
he
and
his
party
were
well
down
to
the
spruit
the
boers
rushed
out
in
large
numbers
forcing
them
to
retreat
in
haste
towards
the
covering
party
who
were
unable
to
fire
as
they
could
not
distinguish
friend
from
foe
the
whole
patrol
being
outnumbered
by
ten
to
one
with
their
line
of
retreat
threatened
had
no
choice
but
to
escape
as
best
they
could
in
an
easterly
direction
three
men
were
taken
prisoners
through
their
horses
being
exhausted
sergeant
party
finding
itself
cut
off
escaped
in
a
southerly
direction
and
reached
johannesburg
in
safety
next
day
the
patrol
that
night
came
back
nine
short
it
turned
out
that
three
had
been
taken
prisoners
and
the
remaining
six
arrived
in
camp
from
various
directions
the
following
day
the
three
prisoners
returned
three
days
later
having
been
treated
with
great
kindness
by
the
boers
who
only
took
their
horses
rifles
and
accoutrements
and
were
evidently
much
amused
by
the
way
in
which
our
patrols
were
sent
out
every
day
to
face
almost
certain
capture
or
death
in
accordance
with
orders
they
considered
this
patrol
as
very
useful
to
supply
them
with
the
necessaries
of
warfare
and
treated
the
whole
thing
as
a
huge
joke
during
the
retreat
on
the
first
of
these
two
patrols
private
graham
did
very
good
work
when
horse
had
fallen
and
then
run
away
graham
made
him
hold
his
stirrup
to
expedite
his
flight
on
foot
and
offered
to
take
turn
and
turn
about
riding
and
running
with
him
it
became
evident
that
they
could
not
both
get
away
so
graham
taking
rifle
and
catching
his
horse
afterwards
brought
both
animals
and
rifles
out
of
action
saving
them
from
the
hands
of
the
enemy
and
earning
the
commendation
of
the
colonel
on
his
arrival
in
camp
on
the
colonel

official
report
of
the
incident
to
colonel
lumsden
does
full
justice
to
trooper
conduct
in
the
following
words
when
about
two
miles
from
crocodile
river
while
i
was
questioning
a
farmer
the
enemy
suddenly
opened
fire
on
us
from
a
ridge
in
front
between
and
yards
distant
i
was
with
the
scouts
when
this
happened
we
galloped
back
to
the
rest
of
the
patrol
which
only
consisted
of
a
total
of
nine
troopers
and
before
we
could
take
up
any
position
the
fire
began
to
come
from
three
sides
so
i
gave
the
order
to
retire
as
fast
as
possible
to
avoid
being
surrounded
in
the
retreat
under
a
heavy
fire
trooper
cayley
one
of
the
scouts
was
thrown
from
his
horse
whereupon
trooper
graham
with
great
gallantry
stayed
behind
and
gave
cayley
a
ride
on
his
own
horse
running
by
his
side
and
then
mounting
and
cayley
running
the
rest
of
the
patrol
being
scattered
and
the
ground
much
broken
these
two
were
not
missed
for
some
time
after
some
distance
had
been
traversed
the
boers
were
getting
so
close
and
the
fire
so
hot
that
it
would
have
been
impossible
for
both
to
escape
trooper
cayley
thereupon
flung
himself
into
a
small
ditch
and
trooper
graham
made
off
not
however
without
bringing
rifle
on
the
way
to
rejoin
the
patrol
and
still
under
fire
he
came
across
a
riderless
horse
of
another
of
the
party
and
brought
it
safely
back
with
rifle
the
patrol
then
observing
him
coming
turned
to
his
support
and
the
boers
discontinued
the
pursuit
for
his
gallant
behaviour
on
this
occasion
trooper
graham
was
recommended
by
colonel
lumsden
for
the
victoria
cross
but
instead
of
that
coveted
decoration
he
subsequently
received

the
talented
correspondent
of

writes
as
follows
of
the
same
affair
one
morning
a
patrol
set
forth
to
spy
the
land
an
officer
and
eleven
men
they
rode
west
for
fifteen
miles
and
entered
the
hills
aforesaid
their
object
being
to
reach
the
junction
of
six
mile
spruit
with
the
crocodile
river
the
way
being
purely
it
was
a
difficult
matter
to
locate
their
destination
and
seeing
a
farmhouse
at
the
top
of
a
valley
the
patrol
made
for
it
with
the
object
of
being
directed
the
valley
traversed
was
some
thousand
yards
wide
from
ridge
to
ridge
at
the
far
end
was
the
farmhouse
and
beyond
a
low
hill
down
the
middle
of
the
valley
ran
a
spruit
between
high
banks
forming
a
donga
deep
and
wide
enough
to
cover
mounted
men
the
path
running
up
the
valley
crossed
the
donga
yards
from
the
farmhouse
our
fellows
trotted
up
to
the
farmhouse
some
tackling
the
lady
of
the
house
and
the
others
the
boer
himself
who
was
spotted
on
the
road
a
little
way
off
the
good
lady
was
a
bit
nervous
and
rather
hastily
volunteered
the
information
that
the
boers
had
all
gone
away
though
never
dreaming
of
their
presence
so
near
this
aroused
the
suspicions
of
the
man
to
whom
the
remark
was
made
and
he
went
up
to
the
farmer
and
roughly
demanded
where
the
boers
were
the
question
rather
startled
him
and
from
his
manner
it
became
evident
that
boers
were
about
though
he
swore
they
had
left
the
night
before
thereupon
the
patrol
in
open
order
advanced
across
the
rising
to
the
right
with
bearne
graham
and
cayley
in
front
a
wire
fence
obstructed
the
way
and
it
was
a
moot
point
whether
to
go
round
by
a
gate
to
the
left
or
to
use
the
this
fence
was
eighty
yards
from
the
top
of
the
ridge
to
which
it
ran
parallel
the
cutting
of
the
fence
saved
the
lives
of
the
men
mentioned
hardly
were
they
through
the
opening
than
a
heavy
fire
was
opened
on
them
at
a
range
of
fifty
yards
the
rest
of
the
party
being
a
hundred
yards
behind
not
yet
up
to
the
fence
cayley
bearne
and
graham
whipped
round
and
made
for
the
cutting
which
was
luckily
immediately
behind
them
if
they
had
gone
round
by
the
gate
to
the
left
they
would
have
had
to
stand
fire
getting
to
the
gate
and
then
run
the
gauntlet
all
the
way
back
as
it
was
they
got
safely
through
the
cutting
and
legged
it
after
the
rest
the
party
making
straight
down
the
valley
for
the
donga
already
described
as
the
distance
between
the
boers
and
the
donga
was
only
yards
it
can
be
imagined
how
hot
the
fire
was
extraordinary
to
relate
not
a
man
was
touched
during
the
brief
but
dangerous
interval
which
elapsed
between
leaving
the
wire
fence
and
reaching
the
donga
arrived
there
a
new
foe
sprang
upon
the
unlucky
patrol
illustration
bearne
from
the
left
of
the
hill
behind
the
farmhouse
and
at
the
point
where
the
left
ridge
forming
the
valley
joined
this
hill
another
lot
of
boers
opened
a
heavy
enfilade
fire
at
a
thousand
range
their
sanctuary
was
a
sanctuary
no
longer
and
again
the
patrol
fled
this
time
straight
for
the
opening
in
the
hills
by
which
they
had
entered
meantime
the
second
lot
of
boers
kept
up
a
brisk
fusillade
many
of
them
mounting
horses
and
galloping
along
the
ridge
parallel
with
the
flying
patrol
as
our
men
had
travelled
some
twenty
miles
their
horses
were
pretty
beaten
so
that
the
boers
in
light
order
had
no
difficulty
in
catching
up
and
taking
pot
shots
at
short
range
shortly
after
leaving
the
donga
horse
fell
heavily
and
got
away
from
his
fallen
rider
thereupon
graham
pulled
up
gave
cayley
his
stirrup
and
the
latter
ran
until
exhausted
graham
then
very
gallantly
insisted
upon
cayley
riding
while
graham
ran
when
beaten
graham
mounted
again
and
cayley
ran
at
this
point
the
boers
had
got
close
up
and
were
pouring
in
a
hot
fire
and
the
situation
endangering
both
men
cayley
who
was
much
exhausted
let
go
insisting
on
graham
leaving
him
hoping
himself
to
escape
the
boers
by
hiding
among
the
rocks
near
the
same
place
horse
stopped
dead
beat
bearne
got
off
and
ran
until
done
when
he
too
took
cover
from
the
boers
who
were
close
at
his
heels
peppering
for
all
they
were
worth
by
this
time
the
remainder
of
the
patrol
headed
by
captain
clifford
who
was
in
charge
had
got
well
away
and
they
eventually
returned
to
camp
late
at
night
having
had
to
walk
most
of
the
way
back
as
their
horses
were
too
done
to
carry
them
but
cayley
and
bearne
never
had
a
chance
for
the
boers
had
never
lost
sight
of
them
they
were
quickly
routed
out
of
their
cover
and
having
dropped
their
arms
when
running
defenceless
they
had
to
surrender
to
overwhelming
numbers
the
boers
explained
to
them
what
had
happened
on
their
side
and
it
would
seem
to
be
only
by
a
bit
of
luck
that
the
whole
patrol
was
not
captured
right
behind
the
low
hill
at
the
back
of
the
farmhouse
was
a
laager
where
a
number
of
boers
were
encamped
five
said
though
there
must
have
been
quadruple
the
number
boers
had
gone
over
to
the
farmhouse
already
mentioned
half
an
hour
before
the
patrol
appeared
failing
to
find
forage
there
they
had
proceeded
up
the
hill
with
the
intention
of
crossing
into
the
next
valley
to
visit
another
farmhouse
when
on
the
sky
line
they
spotted
our
patrol
advancing
the
boers
immediately
lay
low
to
watch
what
happened
realising
that
the
patrol
was
riding
into
the
mouth
they
meant
to
keep
doggo
until
the
party
was
close
up
and
consequently
far
away
from
the
only
point
of
the
road
by
which
it
had
come
when
close
up
they
would
open
fire
warning
at
the
same
time
their
own
camp
over
the
hill
scarce
a
mile
away
luckily
for
us
their
camp
proved
slow
to
hear
else
the
main
body
of
boers
would
have
rushed
for
the
donga
and
regularly
trapped
the
crowd
as
it
was
our
men
had
reached
the
donga
before
the
laager
had
awakened
to
the
situation
cayley
and
bearne
were
kindly
treated
but
marched
about
unmercifully
eventually
reaching
the
main
boer
laager
at
commando
nek
where
a
short
time
previously
the
lincolns
and
scots
greys
had
come
to
such
terrible
grief
there
the
unhappy
pair
were
released
to
struggle
twenty
miles
into
pretoria
as
best
they
might
shortly
after
the
adventurous
descent
on
the
crocodile
river
fastnesses
which
i
have
already
described
a
second
and
larger
patrol
with
captain
clifford
again
in
command
set
forth
to
avenge
the
disasters
of
the
first
as
i
have
a
particular
regard
for
my
personal
safety
and
believing
the
neighbourhood
accursed
i
found
it
convenient
to
be
otherwise
occupied
at
the
moment
when
patrol
no
started
and
subsequent
events
proved
me
wiser
than
my
generation
not
being
present
at
what
happened
i
can
not
of
course
tell
exactly
how
it
came
about
nor
could
i
piece
the
twenty
different
accounts
given
me
into
a
satisfactory
whole
for
the
very
good
reason
that
no
two
of
the
stories
afterwards
told
me
would
fit
in
however
it
would
appear
that
it
happened
somewhat
thus
the
party
started
out
at
daybreak
and
reached
the
scene
of
the
previous
disaster
in
good
time
in
the
morning
needless
to
say
the
boers
were
on
the
this
time
and
so
soon
as
the
patrol
hove
in
sight
made
their
dispositions
with
a
wariness
born
of
experience
there
was
no
venturing
into
the
valley
the
party
spread
over
the
ridge
along
which
the
boers
had
followed
them
on
the
first
occasion
and
advanced
in
skirmishing
order
with
scouts
in
front
smelling
out
every
nook
and
cranny
and
so
they
came
as
they
say
in
racing
parlance
right
along
the
ridge
until
close
up
to
the
farmhouse
all
the
time
the
boers
in
force
were
happily
contemplating
these
operations
from
the
opposite
ridge
which
they
had
selected
as
being
the
one
not
likely
to
be
scouted
as
the
ridge
ran
into
the
hill
behind
the
farmhouse
it
became
necessary
if
any
act
of
retribution
was
to
be
performed
on
the
farmer
to
diverge
from
that
line
of
advance
and
make
for
the
farmhouse
this
was
done
and
of
course
brought
the
patrol
into
closer
order
at
the
farmhouse
one
of
its
occupants
handed
a
note
to
captain
clifford
it
was
from
the
farmer
and
ran
going
down
the
road
to
kill
a
pig
for
a
neighbour
will
be
back
in
a
few
and
then
the
band
began
to
play
from
the
hill
in
front
and
the
ridge
on
the
right
the
mausers
spoke
out
their
unwelcome
messages
in
a
continuous
stream
till
it
seemed
as
if
the
blue
sky
above
must
crack
for
the
noise
round
whipped
the
patrol
and
in
went
the
spurs
captain
clifford
leading
his
men
down
the
valley
that
seemed
as
if
it
must
spell
death
for
the
whole
party
there
were
boers
in
all
firing
at
an
average
range
of
yards
for
a
distance
of
two
miles
several
horses
were
shot
several
fell
some
stopped
from
exhaustion
but
there
was
no
way
of
getting
out
except
along
the
road
which
ran
parallel
to
the
ridge
occupied
by
the
enemy
the
rocky
going
on
the
other
ridge
precluded
a
retreat
over
its
inhospitable
sides
besides
which
it
was
commanded
on
both
slopes
from
the
hill
behind
the
farmhouse
that
night
at
irene
the
return
of
the
patrol
was
anxiously
awaited
it
seemed
a
strange
thing
to
many
marvellous
that
no
man
had
a
mark
on
him
and
this
shows
again
what
extraordinarily
bad
shooting
the
boers
are
capable
of
at
moving
bodies
and
particularly
when
they
are
not
certain
if
another
and
concealed
movement
is
not
being
conducted
on
their
rear
of
the
party
sent
on
the
expedition
one
by
one
continued
to
arrive
back
some
late
the
same
night
some
during
the
next
day
some
even
the
day
after
until
at
last
the
lot
were
accounted
for
three
of
the
unlucky
patrol
had
trekked
for
johannesburg
and
advised
us
by
telegraph
of
their
safety
another
struck
the
railway
at
kaalfontein
and
so
they
straggled
in
weary
hungry
and
dirty
several
were
taken
prisoners
but
treated
kindly
enough
one
attention
in
particular
being
much
appreciated
that
was
a
stomach
warmer
of
peach
brandy
before
they
were
set
free
for
their
march
back
to
irene
rather
an
insulting
message
given
the
released
ones
was
to
the
effect
that
the
boers
would
have
coffee
ready
next
time
we
came
after
these
events
colonel
request
for
more
active
employment
than
his
corps
could
find
on
lines
of
communication
was
granted
and
the
sequel
is
described
by
a
correspondent
of
the
we
left
springs
on
july
expecting
to
join
general
hutton
who
we
heard
had
had
a
severe
engagement
with
heavy
casualties
and
was
in
want
of
more
mounted
troops
however
after
a
night
at
kaalfontein
we
moved
on
to
irene
which
place
is
the
headquarters
of
the
mounted
infantry
now
on
communications
between
johannesburg
and
pretoria
we
remained
at
irene
a
week
during
which
time
we
had
some
men
taken
prisoners
owing
to
their
horses
giving
out
when
being
pursued
by
the
boers
who
were
always
lying
in
wait
for
our
patrols
we
were
exceedingly
fortunate
in
having
nobody
hit
on
these
occasions
the
prisoners
were
in
every
case
released
their
rifles
and
horses
of
course
being
taken
from
them
apparently
the
boers
now
find
prisoners
an
encumbrance
on
the
we
moved
to
pretoria
camping
three
miles
outside
the
town
pretoria
is
prettily
situated
in
a
hollow
surrounded
by
hills
these
hills
to
the
and
about
ten
miles
out
sheltered
a
number
of
boers
and
on
the
we
set
out
on
a
reconnaissance
to
find
out
something
about
them
the
force
under
hickman
consisted
of
the
and
mounted
infantry
regiments
a
battery
of
field
artillery
and
a
battalion
of
infantry
the
cornwalls
we
saw
nothing
of
the
enemy
until
evening
when
the
advance
guard
came
into
touch
and
exchanged
shots
with
the
scouts
who
retired
the
next
morning
we
had
scarcely
started
when
we
heard
the
now
familiar
double
thud
of
the
mauser
and
found
that
the
oxford
company
of
the
mounted
infantry
were
engaged
it
was
a
very
different
country
from
what
we
had
been
used
to
and
it
did
not
suit
us
nearly
so
well
we
were
in
a
valley
with
steep
hills
on
either
side
the
slopes
of
which
were
covered
with
loose
stones
and
rocks
of
every
size
and
shape
which
made
the
going
almost
impossible
for
horses
and
very
trying
for
the
men
the
came
into
action
close
on
our
left
and
shelled
a
steep
kopje
opposite
for
some
time
meanwhile
a
brisk
rifle
fire
was
being
kept
up
by
the
mounted
infantry
on
our
left
at
the
end
of
about
an
hour
the
general
had
apparently
found
out
all
he
wanted
to
know
for
the
order
to
retire
came
the
mounted
infantry
to
act
as
rearguard
were
deputed
to
guard
the
left
flank
which
we
did
retiring
by
alternate
companies
along
the
top
of
the
range
of
kopjes
while
the
infantry
and
guns
moved
along
the
valley
the
enemy
followed
in
a
way
but
were
easily
kept
in
check
by
the
which
dropped
shells
into
them
whenever
they
showed
themselves
in
any
numbers
beyond
firing
at
a
few
of
their
scouts
we
saw
nothing
of
them
the
casualties
had
been
slight
the
oxford
company
mounted
infantry
having
one
man
killed
and
one
wounded
an
charger
hit
was
all
the
damage
done
to
horse
on
the
general
ian
division
consisting
of
general
bruce
general
and
general
brigades
marched
into
pretoria
lord
roberts
and
his
staff
with
general
ian
hamilton
on
his
right
and
lord
kitchener
on
his
left
took
up
his
position
in
the
market
square
while
the
troops
marched
past
cheering
him
as
they
went
the
same
day
we
heard
the
good
news
that
of
the
enemy
had
surrendered
to
general
hunter
more
active
service
however
meant
for
horse
a
transfer
to
some
other
column
and
the
time
had
thus
come
when
they
were
to
bid
farewell
to
colonel
ross
under
whom
they
had
served
for
four
months
and
from
their
comrades
of
the
mounted
infantry
with
whom
they
had
marched
and
fought
in
many
actions
colonel
lumsden
expressed
the
feeling
of
all
ranks
in
his
parting
words
to
colonel
ross
which
were
full
of
appreciation
for
the
many
kindnesses
shown
by
that
gallant
commander
towards
horse
what
colonel
ross
thought
of
the
corps
and
its
officers
may
be
gathered
from
the
regimental
order
acknowledging
their
services
and
from
a
letter
in
which
colonel
ross
writes
as
follows
horse
joined
the
corps
about
the
middle
of
april
and
served
with
the
corps
till
the
end
of
july
when
they
were
transferred
to
general
command
this
was
probably
the
most
completely
equipped
that
joined
the
forces
in
south
africa
during
the
regimental
transport
of
indian
pattern
a
complete
regimental
hospital
and
veterinary
establishment
and
every
of
life
for
man
and
beast
for
a
campaign
in
almost
any
country
the
of
the
corps
was
in
keeping
with
everything
else
colonel
lumsden
though
not
an
experienced
campaigner
when
he
first
arrived
on
active
service
was
a
capable
organiser
and
had
the
natural
gift
of
commanding
the
respect
and
cheerful
obedience
of
all
who
served
under
him
and
he
soon
qualified
as
a
competent
leader
under
fire
he
was
ably
supported
by
a
body
of
officers
and
officers
and
there
was
an
evident
determination
among
all
ranks
that
the
representatives
of
the
indian
auxiliary
forces
should
justify
their
selection
by
the
indian
public
the
was
composed
of
gentlemen
who
had
been
used
to
the
comparative
luxury
of
an
indian
life
and
who
were
untrained
in
cooking
for
themselves
and
attending
to
their
horses
but
they
soon
adapted
themselves
to
the
situation
and
cheerfully
took
their
share
of
all
the
work
of
regular
soldiers
and
with
such
success
that
an
experienced
officer
like
general
hutton
expressed
his
admiration
of
the
manner
in
which
they
did
it
the
capacity
of
horse
can
not
be
entirely
estimated
from
the
gaps
in
their
ranks
they
were
as
a
result
of
their
training
in
civil
life
more
than
the
of
our
regular
army
and
the
looser
formations
they
were
consequently
able
to
adopt
account
in
a
great
measure
for
their
comparatively
small
losses
the
opinion
formed
of
the
corps
by
the
can
be
gathered
from
the
great
number
of
distinctions
promotions
and
commissions
in
the
regular
army
which
were
conferred
on
those
who
remained
the
maxim
will
tell
was
never
better
exemplified
than
in
this
corps
and
should
it
be
my
lot
ever
again
to
command
troops
in
the
field
i
ask
for
no
better
fortune
than
to
have
a
similar
body

chapter

march
under
mahon
of
mafeking
to
rustenburg
and
pursuit
of
de
to
have
served
under
two
leaders
of
high
reputation
for
ability
in
handling
irregular
troops
was
a
stroke
of
good
fortune
that
did
not
fall
to
the
lot
of
many
volunteer
corps
in
south
africa
horse
had
every
reason
to
be
thankful
that
the
lot
was
theirs
and
they
appreciated
it
fully
in
exchanging
from
the
mounted
infantry
regiment
to
another
column
of
which
colonel
bryan
mahon
was
brigadier
they
did
not
forget
the
commander
under
whom
they
had
served
so
long
but
affection
for
him
was
happily
consistent
with
admiration
for
the
officer
to
whose
force
they
were
transferred
after
leaving
irene
both
were
thorough
soldiers
having
strong
sympathies
with
volunteers
and
a
complete
understanding
of
the
peculiarities
that
distinguish
them
from
regulars
in
other
words
both
were
born
leaders
of
men
colonel
mahon
or
general
as
he
then
was
by
local
rank
had
proved
himself
to
be
a
commander
of
great
dash
and
resourcefulness
in
his
conduct
of
operations
by
which
he
won
not
only
the
affectionate
confidence
of
his
own
troops
but
also
the
respect
of
enemies
who
still
speak
with
admiration
of
the
young
cavalry
officer
who
beat
them
at
their
own
game
by
rapid
flank
movements
on
the
way
to
mafeking
and
effected
the
relief
of
that
beleaguered
garrison
in
spite
of
all
de
la
rey
could
do
to
prevent
him
in
ten
days
he
marched
a
distance
of
miles
through
country
destitute
of
supplies
where
no
other
forces
had
disputed
possession
with
the
boers
since
war
began
he
outwitted
the
cleverest
of
de
la
lieutenants
at
kraaipan
by
a
night
march
which
won
his
admiration
and
he
took
a
great
convoy
of
cape
carts
and
heavier
transport
full
of
provisions
into
mafeking
without
having
lost
a
single
waggon
describing
that
surprise
at
kraaipan
when
after
waiting
in
expectation
of
an
attack
by
which
mahon
should
fall
into
the
trap
laid
for
him
the
boers
suddenly
realised
that
the
british
column
had
disappeared
one
of
their
scouts
said
did
not
get
much
rest
as
somebody
had
to
be
on
the
all
night
your
laager
was
quite
near
to
us
but
we
did
not
see
or
hear
anything
move
in
the
morning
however
the
whole
had
vanished
and
when
it
was
too
late
to
stop
them
we
heard
they
were
trekking
away
towards
a
desert
where
nobody
but
boers
or
natives
would
expect
to
find
water
your
general
must
have
had
somebody
with
him
who
knew
that
country
well
or
he
would
never
have
ventured
the
in
this
case
may
have
been
colonel
frank
rhodes
the
bearer
of
a
name
which
is
one
to
conjure
with
still
among
the
native
tribes
of
bechuanaland
he
was
intelligence
officer
and
information
gleaned
by
him
made
the
night
march
possible
but
it
was
the
young
brigadier
who
planned
and
carried
it
into
execution
at
a
time
when
his
enemies
thought
they
had
him
surely
trapped
when
a
complete
history
of
the
campaign
comes
to
be
written
that
march
of
for
the
relief
of
mafeking
will
rank
high
among
the
most
daring
and
successful
operations
all
this
story
was
known
weeks
before
the
general
himself
arrived
at
pretoria
with
the
imperial
light
horse
who
had
won
fresh
honours
in
that
enterprise
under
a
leader
whose
praises
they
never
tired
of
singing
no
expectation
of
being
brigaded
with
such
a
famous
corps
under
such
a
brigadier
had
occurred
to
horse
when
they
left
irene
indeed
they
seem
to
have
regarded
themselves
as
an
integral
unit
of
the
mounted
infantry
up
to
the
day
when
colonel
ross
receiving
orders
for
a
movement
southwards
went
off
with
other
corps
of
his
command
leaving
horse
behind
meanwhile
however
they
had
been
placed
for
a
time
at
the
disposal
of
colonel
hickman
under
whom
they
took
part
in
the
brief
operations
already
described
towards
crocodile
river
which
were
merely
a
reconnaissance
for
the
more
important
enterprise
to
follow
it
will
be
remembered
that
lord
roberts
about
this
time
had
both
hands
fully
occupied
in
keeping
botha
at
length
in
the
east
and
stretching
out
his
left
with
considerable
force
westward
to
ward
off
attacks
by
de
la
rey
and
others
who
were
causing
general
much
anxiety
for
the
safety
of
rustenburg
which
he
held
with
a
very
small
number
of
troops
it
would
never
have
done
to
let
the
newly
emancipated
hero
of
mafeking
be
subjected
to
another
siege
therefore
when
he
reported
that
a
strong
force
was
again
threatening
rustenburg
lord
roberts
determined
to
withdraw
that
garrison
to
commando
nek
while
the
small
force
holding
lichtenburg
was
to
retire
upon
zeerust
accordingly
general
ian
hamilton
received
orders
to
march
to
rustenburg
and
bring
force
back
with
him
at
the
same
time
sir
frederick
carrington
was
directed
to
advance
from
mafeking
with
his
mounted
troops
to
the
assistance
of
colonel
hore
who
with
bushmen
men
of
the
rhodesian
regiment
and
rhodesian
volunteers
was
at
river
with
a
convoy
of
supplies
for
the
rustenburg
garrison
and
held
up
there
by
an
intercepting
body
of
boers
this
brief
summary
of
the
general
situation
is
necessary
to
a
clear
understanding
of
the
exigencies
that
necessitated
general
ian
movement
eastward
along
the
magaliesberg
and
the
reconnaissance
immediately
preceding
it
in
all
of
which
important
operations
horse
were
actively
engaged
from
start
to
finish
the
force
marched
in
three
columns
colonel
being
on
the
left
general
ian
in
the
centre
and
on
the
right
each
being
separated
from
the
other
by
a
rough
range
of
hills
which
in
places
became
quite
mountainous
all
this
range
sweeping
round
the
hollow
in
which
pretoria
lies
and
then
stretching
away
westward
by
irregular
curves
past
rustenburg
to
river
is
known
as
the
magaliesberg
and
famed
for
the
fertility
of
valleys
that
broaden
out
at
its
feet
from
many
rugged
kloofs
in
it
is
the
great
district
of
the
veritable
garden
where
orange
groves
flourishing
in
wild
luxuriance
sweeten
the
air
with
their
fragrance
and
brighten
the
landscape
with
the
richness
of
their
golden
fruit
in
its
commanding
crests
and
narrow
defiles
formed
a
series
of
strongholds
for
the
commandos
that
rallied
round
general
de
la
rey
and
by
their
daring
raids
gained
a
reputation
as
the
best
fighters
of
all
boers
then
in
the
field
every
kaffir
path
by
which
scouts
could
move
unseen
was
familiar
to
them
they
knew
every
point
from
which
wide
views
could
be
obtained
in
all
directions
and
every
nook
in
which
men
might
hide
secure
from
observation
ready
for
a
sudden
attack
if
occasion
should
serve
yet
having
more
than
one
way
open
for
escape
from
any
danger
that
might
threaten
them
general
with
the
relieved
garrison
from
mafeking
had
marched
through
a
mountainous
country
and
crossed
the
magaliesberg
to
rustenburg
meeting
no
opposition
the
boer
forces
belonging
to
that
district
had
then
more
serious
affairs
to
occupy
them
elsewhere
but
after
the
fight
at
diamond
hill
when
general
botha
retired
to
the
eastern
transvaal
de
la
rey
came
back
to
his
old
haunts
on
the
magaliesberg
surprised
a
british
post
near
nek
and
began
a
series
of
operations
by
which
he
threatened
to
cut
off
all
supplies
from
rustenburg
colonel
lumsden
continues
his
diary
two
days
after
our
return
to
pretoria
from
the
reconnaissance
under
colonel
hickman
the
mounted
infantry
received
orders
to
entrain
at
for
wolve

the
station
next
south
of
vereeniging
but
at
the
station
the
order
as
far
as
we
were
concerned
was
countermanded
and
we
were
told
to
return
and
report
to
general
mahon
his
instructions
were
that
we
should
remain
in
our
present
camp
and
fall
in
as
rearguard
when
his
column
marched
off
for
rustenburg
on
august
the
morning
of
that
day
therefore
found
us
in
rear
of
the
baggage
of
his

which
was
moving
to

of

that

off

magaliesberg
range
near
uitval
nek
which
the
enemy
held
strongly
as
general
brigade
was
moving
along
the
north
side
of
those
precipitous
ridges
through
a
country
thick
with
scrub
no
communication
could
be
kept
up
between
the
two
forces
and
hamilton
whose
march
was
unimpeded
by
natural
difficulties
had
not
allowed
sufficient
time
for
his
colleague
to
cover
the
treacherous
ground
through
which
many
tributaries
of
the
crocodile
river
run
their
devious
courses
on
getting
touch
with
the
enemy
whose
position
he
had
located
ian
hamilton
went
for
them
at
once
a
portion
of
brigade
making
as
if
for
a
frontal
attack
while
two
companies
of
the
berkshire
regiment
led
by
major
elmhirst
rhodes
gallantly
escaladed
the
steep
cliff
overlooking
the
pass
from
its
eastern
side
losses
in
this
fight
amounted
to
forty
killed
and
wounded
before
the
boers
could
be
dislodged
but
as
soon
as
they
found
that
their
position
was
under
fire
from
above
where
the
berkshires
had
gained
a
footing
the
enemy
fled
abandoning
their
waggons
and
horses
unfortunately
delayed
by
the
obstacles
already
mentioned
mounted
troops
did
not
come
up
in
time
to
take
any
part
otherwise
but
few
of
the
enemy
could
have
escaped
a
correspondent
of
the
of
india
taking
up
the
story
a
day
after
this
fight
when
general
force
had
got
through
the
denser
bush
country
into
a
more
smiling
region
only
to
find
that
the
enemy
had
disappeared
writes
the
valley
we
were
passing
through
was
well
watered
and
cultivated
and
in
some
places
fairly
thickly
wooded
much
pleasanter
country
for
travelling
through
than
the
bare
monotonous
veldt
of
which
we
had
seen
so
much
in
the
free
state
we
passed
many
snug
farmhouses
also
several
flourishing
orange
groves
at
one
place
there
were
acres
of
orange
trees
simply
laden
with
fruit
and
as
they
were
going
to
waste
we
were
allowed
to
help
ourselves
the
oranges
were
very
fine
and
beautifully
ripe
one
man
from
each
was
allowed
to
go
and
gather
them
and
in
a
few
minutes
came
back
literally
bulging
with
nosebags
pockets
overflowing
the
little
tangerines
being
especially
appreciated
some
of
the
australians
were
so
enchanted
by
this
valley
that
they
doubted
whether
there
could
be
another
such
in
all
the
world
that
night
we
were
all
aroused
to
assist
in
putting
out
a
veldt
fire
which
had
approached
uncomfortably
close
to
the
camp
owing
to
a
high
wind
and
the
fact
that
the
grass
was
particularly
long
and
dry
it
was
much
fiercer
than
is
usually
the
case
however
we
set
to
work
with
blankets
and
beat
it
out
where
it
was
too
threatening
and
then
burnt
a
ring
round
the
camp
effectually
stopping
its
progress
a
boer
spy
was
caught
in
camp
that
night
he
had
a
pass
on
him
showing
that
he
had
taken
the
oath
of
neutrality
and
he
had
expansive
bullets
in
his
bandolier
he
was
shot
next
morning
progress
was
naturally
very
slow
owing
to
the
difficult
nature
of
the
country
and
the
fact
that
the
hills
had
to
be
very
carefully
scouted
we
were
rearguard
that
day
and
saw
no
fighting
ourselves
but
the
scouts
in
front
evidently
soon
put
up
the
boers
as
we
heard
rifle
shots
being
exchanged
constantly
and
every
now
and
then
our
guns
shelled
the
retreating
enemy
i
may
mention
here
that
the
imperial
light
horse
formed
part
of
the
mounted
infantry
in
general
brigade
this
was
the
first
time
we
had
come
across
this
famous
corps
which
had
done
such
splendid
work
during
the
war
and
a
very
fine
body
of
men
we
thought
them
possessing
a
knowledge
of
the
language
and
in
many
cases
of
the
country
they
are
most
useful
as
scouts
and
general
mahon
fully
recognised
that
fact
during
the
whole
march
as
he
gave
them
plenty
of
work
to
do
besides
this
they
were
old
friends
of
his
having
been
under
his
command
with
the
mafeking
relief
column
and
they
have
been
with
him
ever
since
ian
hamilton
we
heard
afterwards
had
met
with
a
pretty
stubborn
resistance
from
the
boers
in
his
valley
where
as
had
been
anticipated
their
main
body
was
opposed
to
him
and
he
had
several
casualties
we
only
advanced
about
twelve
miles
that
day
next
day
the
driving
process
recommenced
horse
during
the
greater
part
of
the
time
occupying
a
very
high
kopje
from
which
we
were
ordered
to
keep
a
bright
and
to
hold
it
if
attacked
it
was
a
devil
of
a
climb
the
horses
were
kept
below
but
the
view
from
the
top
almost
compensated
us
for
our
trouble
this
part
of
the
country
was
certainly
the
best
we
had
been
through
so
far
beautifully
wooded
in
many
places
and
dotted
all
over
with
farms
and
orange
groves
the
oranges
were
simply
delicious
especially
the
tangerine
variety
and
we
took
full
advantage
of
the
opportunity
afforded
us
of
having
our
fill
of
them
each
man
eating
as
many
as
he
could
on
the
spot
and
carrying
away
a
nosebagful
with
him
evidently
the
generals
had
orders
to
adopt
strong
measures
in
cases
of
farms
harbouring
boers
or
from
which
any
sniping
might
be
done
or
in
which
ammunition
might
be
stored
as
it
was
a
daily
occurrence
for
two
or
three
of
them
to
be
fired
and
rased
to
the
ground
looking
into
the
next
valley
from
our
high
perch
we
saw
a
huge
camp
below
which
we
at
first
took
to
be
a
boer
laager
but
we
found
out
afterwards
it
was
ian
force
which
had
advanced
quicker
than
we
had
and
had
encamped
for
the
day
we
had
got
to
commando
nek
that
night
and
heard
that
the
boers
from
the
centre
valley
had
already
slipped
through
this
was
unfortunate
but
could
not
be
helped
as
we
could
not
push
on
farther
than
we
did
without
risking
the
sacrifice
of
many
valuable
lives
i
think
we
were
informed
that
the
enemy
numbered
about
and
that
their
main
body
had
got
away
some
time
before
leaving
behind
a
few
snipers
to
keep
us
in
check
this
is
their
usual
method
of
proceeding
and
a
very
sound
one
it
is
one
has
to
see
the
country
oneself
to
realise
what
an
easy
thing
it
is
for
a
few
men
well
placed
to
keep
a
large
body
back
we
send
out
our
scouts
and
immediately
they
are
fired
on
we
shell
the
places
from
which
they
have
been
shot
at
after
this
has
gone
on
for
some
little
time
we
advance
again
and
so
on
progress
is
very
slow
and
meantime
the
bird
has
flown
as
i
say
one
has
to
be
out
in
the
country
to
understand
properly
what
difficulties
the
attacking
party
has
to
contend
against
with
the
numberless
examples
before
them
of
our
men
blundering
into
traps
and
being
slaughtered
and
having
to
surrender
through
going
at
things
baldheaded
as
they
say
our
generals
have
learned
caution
then
on
the
other
hand
the
slow
progress
enables
the
enemy
to
get
away
can
do
of
dilemma
as
our
babu
friends
would
say
then
again
the
boers
know
the
country
thoroughly
and
when
hard
pressed
the
commandant
simply
tells
his
men
to
scatter
and
appoints
some
meeting
place
further
on
his
convoy
scatters
likewise
and
all
travelling
by
three
or
four
different
routes
arrive
at
the
rendezvous
in
due
course
we
on
the
other
hand
have
to
follow
the
beaten
path
and
are
always
being
hung
up
for
hours
by
our
convoys
getting
stuck
in
drifts
it
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
that
the
boers
possessing
these
advantages
so
often
elude
us
general
ian
column
came
through
the
nek
next
day
and
joining
hands
with
general
mahon
proceeded
towards
rustenburg
in
which
direction
the
boers
had
fled
and
where
was
said
to
be
surrounded
and
unable
to
get
away
horses
and
men
fared
very
well
just
then
the
former
getting
plenty
of
commandeered
from
the
hostile
farms
we
passed
and
green
barley
and
in
the
fields
at
the
midday
halts
and
the
latter
securing
fowls
geese
which
were
very
plentiful
in
kaffir
kraals
and
farmhouses
during
the
two
days
it
took
us
to
reach
rustenburg
we
expected
to
get
in
touch
with
the
enemy
at
any
moment
but
they
did
not
come
up
to
the
scratch
and
we
entered
the
town
unopposed
on
august
it
appears
that
hearing
of
ian
approach
the
boers
abandoned
the
kopjes
surrounding
rustenburg
and
relieved
the
pressure
on
who
having
heard
in
the
meantime
that
general
carrington
working
with
a
small
force
in
the
country
between
rustenburg
and
mafeking
was
in
danger
of
losing
his
convoy
had
moved
out
to
his
assistance
the
actual
position
was
that
colonel
hore
marching
with
a
convoy
of
supplies
from
zeerust
to
rustenburg
and
finding
his
way
barred
by
a
greater
force
than
he
could
hope
to
cope
with
and
his
retreat
also
cut
off
had
entrenched
himself
at
river
there
he
waited
for
the
relieving
force
under
general
carrington
which
never
came
nearer
than
within
sound
of
the
boer
guns
and
unfortunately
the
rustenburg
column
also
stopped
short
in
its
attempt
to
relieve
colonel
hore
who
had
to
fight
it
out
for
a
week
or
so
longer
against
enormous
odds
that
might
have
overwhelmed
his
force
but
for
the
magnificent
determination
displayed
by
australian
bushmen
and
rhodesian
volunteers
the
failure
of
that
attempt
at
relief
is
briefly
described
by
colonel
lumsden
whose
diary
also
summarises
subsequent
operations
in
pursuit
of
de
wet
in
the
following
passages
next
day
we
expected
a
rest
but
brigade
was
lent
to
strengthen
general
force
which
was
to
move
at
daybreak
next
morning
to
assist
colonel
hore
who
was
known
to
be
in
difficulties
in
the
direction
of
or
beyond
river
one
of
the
many
streams
bearing
that
name
in
the
colony
this
entailed
a
sharp
ride
of
fifteen
miles
which
brought
us
to
river
and
within
hearing
of
the
cannonading
but
no
further
on
the
bank
of
the
river
was
a
small
group
of
officers
prominent
among
them
being
general
and
by
his
side
were
colonel
plumer
and
major
we
found
the
great
man
seated
on
a
rock
surrounded
by
his
staff
and
sketching
hard
with
both
hands
most
of
us
had
not
seen
him
before
so
it
can
be
imagined
how
glad
we
were
to
have
the
opportunity
of
getting
a
good
look
at
popular
hero
at
the
moment
we
were
also
delighted
at
the
idea
of
being
under
his
command
if
only
for
a
short
time
we
had
a
better
view
of
him
on
the
way
back
and
he
appeared
to
be
very
fit
and
none
the
worse
for
his
mafeking
experiences
while
waiting
here
to
rest
and
water
the
horses
we
heard
big
guns
firing
in
the
direction
in
which
force
was
situated
and
expected
momentarily
to
be
ordered
to
advance
but
after
some
time
we
were
told
that
had
tapped
the
telegraph
wire
and
learned
from
carrington
that
he
had
repulsed
the
boers
and
had
got
his
convoy
away
safely
and
that
he
did
not
require
our
assistance
i
am
afraid
however
that
the
wrong
source
must
have
been
tapped
and
that
a
false
message
intended
to
deceive
must
then
have
come
not
from
carrington
but
from
the
wily
boers
after
two
rest
we
returned
to
rustenburg
for
the
night
having
apparently
accomplished
nothing
in
particular
except
a
march
of
thirty
miles
all
told
rustenburg
was
then
evacuated
and
the
whole
of
general
division
concentrated
near
commando
nek
resting
there
one
day
we
then
went
to
join
the
de
wet
hunt
with
brigade
in
front
and
in
spite
of
only
a
little
skirmishing
advanced
somewhat
slowly
on
the
we
came
into
touch
with
the
eight
generals
who
were
pursuing
de
wet
on
an
organised
plan
from
the
south
towards
nek
we
were
supposed
to
have
been
in
time
to
cut
off
de
wet
and
prevent
him
going
north
to
nek
but
were
unfortunately
too
late
and
all
we
could
do
was
to
join
the
others
and
follow
him
up
the
next
evening
we
were
in
touch
with
the
rearguard
and
in
sight
of
the
nek
the
following
morning
we
escorted
the
big
guns
to
within
range
of
the
nek
took
our
position
on
the
hills
on
the
right
and
watched
the
infantry
make
the
attack
it
was
a
very
pretty
sight
from
our
position
but
the
resistance
was
slight
so
going
through
the
nek
we
reached
rustenburg
for
the
third
time
and
spent
the
night
there
our
laager
being
well
supplied
by
way
of
a
change
with
turkeys
and
fowls
poached
from
local
preserves
away
again
next
morning
reaching
sterkstroom
at
the
next
day
hardly
had
we
with
visions
of
a
raid
on
a
field
of
sweet
potatoes
in
view
before
we
received
orders
to
again
saddle
up
and
march
at
after
de
wet
who
was
reported
just
in
front
of
us
from
till
our
weary
horses
struggled
on
through
the
darkness
we
bivouacked
for
the
night
within
three
miles
of
commando
nek
hoping
as
we
had
often
hoped
before
to
get
de
wet
next
morning
long
ere
day
broke
we
were
up
and
away
again
only
to
find
that
de
force
had
gone
north
along
the
river
towards
roode
kopjes
which
we
reached
at
daybreak
with
still
no
signs
of
the
enemy
on
the
right
bank
of
the
river
and
a
mile
off
were
some
low
rocky
kopjes
covered
with
scrub
on
the
left
a
series
of
high
but
broken
hills
we
as
advance
guard
took
up
our
position
on
the
latter
as
the
boer
convoy
was
trekking
away
in
full
view
across
the
open
from
the
shelter
of
the
former
and
just
out
of
range
of
the
twelve
the
temptation
was
great
to
push
on
in
pursuit
but
our
general
was
luckily
wiser
and
preferred
to
reconnoitre
across
the
river
before
implicating
the
guns
and
main
body
in
what
turned
out
to
be
a
most
difficult
drift
we
from
our
position
looked
on
while
the
new
zealanders
on
the
right
crossed
the
drift
and
spreading
out
advanced
to
the
broken
ground
we
had
just
made
up
our
mind
that
all
was
clear
and
that
the
general
had
been
culpably
slow
when
a
frightful
fusillade
burst
out
on
the
unfortunate
reconnoitrers
from
a
range
of
fifty
yards
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
race
back
as
hard
as
they
could
leaving
six
casualties
behind
two
of
which
resulted
fatally
the
having
failed
and
horse
and
man
being
incapable
of
more
we
all
returned
to
the
previous
camp
at
on
the
we
reoccupied
the
same
kopjes
forced
the
passage
of
the
river
and
with
little
further
resistance
got
into
the
open
country
five
miles
beyond
we
then
marched
through
bushveldt
to
zoutpans
warmbaths
and
waterval
back
to
pretoria
with
very
little
to
record
in
the
ten
days
so
occupied
the
only
interesting
feature
being
the
peculiar
country
known
as
bushveldt
best
described
as
a
sea
of
stunted
thorn
trees
familiarly
known
as
toothpick
trees
with
an
undergrowth
of
coarse
grass
no
roads
but
tracks
of
heavy
sand
which
delayed
the
transport
very
much
scouting
was
practically
impossible
as
it
was
very
difficult
to
get
horses
through
the
formidable
thorny
scrub
while
vision
was
limited
to
thirty
yards
the
operations
are
described
in
fuller
detail
by
correspondents
of
indian
papers
whose
interesting
records
of
events
in
which
they
took
part
need
to
be
dovetailed
together
for
the
sake
of
a
connected
narrative
it
is
necessary
however
to
say
here
by
way
of
introduction
that
after
accomplishing
its
mission
in
the
relief
of
rustenburg
and
the
withdrawal
of
that
garrison
general
ian
column
became
involved
by
force
of
circumstances
in
a
series
of
intricate
operations
with
other
columns
moving
from
east
west
and
south
with
the
object
of
catching
the
wily
de
wet
between
them
one
correspondent
thus
describes
the
march
out
of
rustenburg
it
having
been
decided
to
abandon
the
town
the
night
was
spent
in
destroying
a
lot
of
boer
ammunition
and
rifles
of
every
description
which
had
been
stored
in
the
gaol
there
was
a
constant
succession
of
reports
as
the
cartridges
exploded
and
it
sounded
exactly
as
if
a
smart
general
engagement
was
taking
place
the
next
day
the
rustenburg
was
completely
evacuated
and
the
four
brigades
marched
back
on
their
way
towards
the
crocodile
river
those
of
the
inhabitants
who
had
claimed
british
protection
also
moved
out
with
our
convoy
in
addition
to
whom
were
forty
boer
prisoners
including
piet
kruger
oom
son
under
escort
as
our
progress
was
considerably
retarded
by
the
large
convoy
it
was
despatched
at
night
on
the
to
a
situation
of
safety
each
brigade
was
then
operating
separately
though
supporting
each
other
with
as
a
flying
column
the
next
morning
the
australians
had
a
brush
with
some
sixty
boer
snipers
but
the
main
body
made
a
dash
for
uitval
nek
only
to
find
that
the
enemy
had
again
anticipated
our
arrival
and
had
bolted
getting
through
commando
nek
on
august
we
rejoined
ian
hamilton
who
was
encamped
on
the
other
side
this
was
the
largest
camp
we
had
been
in
so
far
there
must
have
been
quite
men
there
including
troops
from
many
parts
of
the
world
all
general
as
well
as
general
column
were
irregulars
so
that
with
general
ian
regulars
we
were
perhaps
as
representative
a
gathering
as
has
ever
camped
together
englishmen
highlanders
welshmen
and
irishmen
australians
of
all
sorts
canadians
new
zealanders
tasmanians
imperial
yeomanry
from
india
and
colonials
from
all
parts
of
south
africa
the
imperial
light
horse
the
rhodesian
regiment
some
of
scouts
were
present
the
new
zealanders
gave
a
that
night
the
visitors
sitting
or
standing
round
a
huge
log
fire
and
the
performers
occupying
the
centre
it
was
an
excellent
show
several
very
good
men
taking
the
boards
or
rather
the
veldt
the
was
a
march
round
by
some
of
the
argyll
and
sutherland
highlanders
with
pipes
and
drums
playing
our
entertainers
i
must
not
forget
to
mention
supplied
the
crowd
liberally
with
rum
a
drink
among
tommies
and
volunteers
alike
mixed
with
sugar
and
water
and
taken
hot
it
is
hard
to
beat
and
has
kept
off
many
a
fever
i
am
sure
in
wet
weather
i
may
mention
that
rum
was
only
rationed
out
very
occasionally
except
in
extremely
bad
weather
when
we
generally
got
it
daily
rum
nights
needless
to
say
were
hailed
with
delight
and
shouts
of
up
for
your
would
be
heard
all
round
the
camp
illustration
night
in
camp
a
sketch
by
here
the
sequence
of
events
may
be
appropriately
interrupted
for
the
sake
of
some
amusing
incidents
and
anecdotes
told
by
another
correspondent
who
in
connection
with
this
great
gathering
of
troops
in
our
camp
near
commando
nek
writes
after
considerable
practice
the
amateur
cooks
could
make
a
savoury
repast
out
of
very
little
if
there
was
a
garden
about
we
grubbed
up
some
vegetables
with
which
even
the
served
out
in
government
rations
made
an
excellent
stew
it
was
our
fortune
this
night
however
to
be
better
provided
for
by
a
lucky
chance
while
engaged
in
drawing
the
meagre
rations
and
arguing
with
the
over
details
of
ounces
and
pennyweights
that
had
come
to
be
regarded
by
us
as
very
important
matters
we
suddenly
espied
a
great
scurry
going
on
about
a
mile
away
crowds
of
men
rushing
after
what
we
at
last
made
out
to
be
a
small
deer
in
and
out
it
went
among
patrol
tents
horses
saddles
carts
and
guns
frantic
efforts
were
made
in
vain
to
catch
it
men
left
whatever
they
were
doing
to
join
in
the
chase
rolling
over
in
their
endeavours
to
be
first
everybody
threw
something
and
many
dangerous
missiles
came
hurtling
through
the
air
but
the
deer
ran
on
and
suddenly
turned
our
way
we
also
missed
it
by
yards
and
the
shouting
crowd
swept
by
losing
sight
of
their
quarry
presently
and
not
knowing
whither
it
had
gone
a
man
of
ours
happened
to
be
lying
rolled
up
in
his
blanket
asleep
the
din
roused
him
and
just
as
he
was
beginning
to
move
the
buck
rose
for
a
leap
over
his
body
he
caught
it
in
the
outspread
blanket
and
kept
it
there
so
the
game
came
to
our
mess
after
all
by
sheer
luck
on
the
strength
of
it
we
invited
our
very
good
friends
and
neighbours
the
bushmen
queensland
mounted
infantry
to
dine
with
us
that
night
and
soon
after
sunset
they
came
round
to
our
fire
very
good
fellows
they
were
and
a
very
genial
dinner
we
had
our
guests
brought
their
own
stew
which
was
excellent
and
their
coffee
too
with
which
to
eke
out
our
supplies
one
of
our
men
produced
some
good
cheroots
afterwards
and
we
sat
on
into
the
night
smoking
sipping
coffee
and
telling
stories
the
hills
all
around
being
lighted
up
with
lines
of
veldt
fires
and
the
sky
illuminated
by
a
glorious
full
moon
some
of
the
stories
against
themselves
were
most
amusing
they
had
as
good
a
name
as
anybody
for
and
one
of
them
told
us
gravely
that
when
he
was
walking
one
day
through
another
lines
a
sergeant
spotted
him
and
gave
the
order
to
your
he
said
he
was
so
overcome
by
the
that
he
could
hardly
acknowledge
it
on
another
occasion
at
a
midday
halt
when
the
teams
were
brought
back
from
watering
the
distracted
officer
in
charge
found
one
of
the
fattest
and
best
oxen
was
missing
he
only
just
discovered
it
in
time
to
save
its
life
and
deprive
the
bushmen
of
a
feast
they
told
us
many
tricks
for
changing
a
marks
brands
colour
and
general
appearance
so
that
no
man
might
know
his
own
horse
thus
transformed
and
i
looked
anxiously
towards
my
own
chestnut
quite
expecting
to
find
that
he
had
either
been
taken
away
to
the
camp
of
our
neighbours
or
practically
before
my
own
eyes
others
joined
our
circle
as
the
moon
rose
higher
the
whole
camp
seemed
in
excellent
spirits
sounds
of
revelry
wafted
on
the
still
night
air
reached
us
from
many
a
snatches
of
song
broken
anon
by
outbursts
of
cheering
elsewhere
uprose
the
strains
of
the
highland
pipes
rumour
is
busy
that
we
are
to
join
in
the
chase
after
de
wet
who
is
breaking
away
north
we
wonder
as
we
roll
into
our
blankets
when
will
be
our
next
day
of
rest
and
the
rumours
were
true
for
once
not
many
hours
elapsed
before
brigade
with
the
remainder
of
force
was
on
the
move
southward
and
westward
through
commando
nek
into
rustenburg
again
and
then
away
still
pursuing
into
the
bushveldt
the
elusive
force
which
they
took
to
be
de
as
a
matter
of
fact
de
wet
had
already
left
this
force
he
personally
did
not
quit
the
magaliesberg
range
but
doubling
back
with
a
small
band
of
trusty
followers
the
day
after
his
passage
of
nek
he
slipped
through
a
neighbouring
poort
and
so
got
at
once
in
rear
of
his
pursuers
they
were
thenceforth
on
the
heels
of
a
fresh
force
which
de
la
rey
had
detached
to
serve
as
a
all
these
facts
the
editor
has
learned
from
the
lips
of
general
de
la
rey
himself
recently
the
next
rest
did
not
come
for
several
weary
days
owing
to
circumstances
that
are
described
by
other
correspondents
in
the
following
letters
after
a
rest
general
being
left
behind
with
a
small
force
to
guard
commando
nek
the
division
advanced
again
in
a
direction
to
try
to
cut
off
de
wet
who
was
being
driven
north
by
kitchener
methuen
hart
and
broadwood
we
encountered
a
small
body
of
fifty
boers
but
a
few
shells
sent
among
these
soon
dislodged
them
from
the
kopje
on
which
they
had
taken
up
a
position
and
we
did
not
see
them
again
we
got
to
a
place
called
hekpoort
the
next
day
and
here
it
was
decided
to
convert
brigade
into
a
flying
column
which
meant
that
we
were
to
travel
without
any
transport
each
man
being
served
out
with
three
rations
which
he
carried
with
him
this
column
was
to
work
independently
of
the
rest
of
the
division
and
be
ready
to
start
in
pursuit
of
de
wet
at
a
notice
should
we
get
news
of
him
leaving
ian
hamilton
to
follow
on
slowly
by
another
route
brigade
marched
at
daybreak
on
the
we
acting
as
advance
scouts
the
country
hereabouts
is
very
hilly
and
affords
excellent
cover
for
the
wily
sniper
so
scouting
was
not
all
and
visions
of
grouse
moors
at
home
were
naturally
strong
upon
some
of
us
that
day
and
thoughts
ran
irresistibly
to
parallels
between
the
driving
of
grouse
and
our
attempts
to
round
up
de
wet
one
was
constantly
on
the
qui
vive
expecting
to
be
shot
at
any
moment
as
the
enemy
were
known
to
be
about
nothing
happened
however
and
the
next
few
days
were
spent
in
loafing
along
doing
about
ten
miles
or
so
in
momentary
expectation
of
getting
in
touch
with
de
wet
but
this
movements
were
as
erratic
as
usual
and
it
was
evidently
impossible
to
get
any
reliable
information
as
to
his
exact
whereabouts
it
was
known
that
he
was
being
driven
towards
nek
by
lord
methuen
and
the
others
mentioned
above
and
it
would
appear
that
the
proper
course
to
have
pursued
was
to
have
held
this
pass
which
was
the
only
possible
avenue
of
escape
left
to
de
wet
and
wait
for
him
there
instead
of
wandering
about
more
or
less
aimlessly
as
we
were
doing
this
could
very
easily
have
been
done
one
imagines
with
a
small
portion
of
the
large
force
at
general
disposal
and
why
it
was
not
tried
is
an
unsolved
mystery
to
a
great
many
of
us
up
to
the
present
as
far
as
an
outsider
can
see
a
very
serious
blunder
was
committed
here
and
we
apparently
lost
a
chance
of
bringing
the
war
to
a
speedy
conclusion
had
de
wet
been
caught
botha
would
probably
have
surrendered
and
the
other
commandants
would
have
followed
suit
as
it
was
however
we
moved
along
slowly
the
monotony
being
broken
now
and
again
by
an
exchange
of
shots
between
our
scouts
and
scattered
parties
of
boers
on
the
adjacent
hills
about
midday
on
august
horse
were
detached
from
the
main
body
and
sent
off
to
the
flank
to
reconnoitre
and
on
our
way
met
a
party
of
the
imperial
light
horse
who
had
been
sent
out
to
burn
a
farm
situated
in
a
hollow
among
some
hills
from
which
the
boers
had
been
sniping
the
officer
in
charge
of
the
imperial
light
horse
party
requested
captain
noblett
under
whose
command
we
were
to
keep
us
on
the
top
of
the
hill
to
prevent
surprise
while
he
and
his
men
went
and
destroyed
the
farm
this
was
done
but
for
some
reason
or
another
the
imperial
light
horse
officer
changed
his
mind
and
did
not
burn
the
farm
while
on
the
hill
we
were
told
by
some
kaffirs
that
the
enemy
about
eighty
in
number
had
left
a
few
moments
before
seeing
our
scouts
coming
over
the
hill
they
had
fled
precipitately
we
went
down
to
the
farm
after
the
imperial
light
horse
party
had
gone
on
and
had
hardly
left
it
to
return
to
the
main
body
again
when
we
saw
a
small
party
of
boers
on
the
hill
on
our
right
and
these
were
doubtless
the
men
referred
to
by
the
kaffirs
we
had
spoken
to
instead
of
going
by
the
road
we
took
a
short
cut
across
the
veldt
as
it
was
rather
late
and
we
wanted
to
get
back
to
the
main
body
before
nightfall
it
turned
out
afterwards
that
it
was
as
well
we
did
so
as
on
the
way
we
heard
firing
on
our
right
and
on
approaching
to
see
what
it
was
all
about
saw
that
the
road
led
through
a
deep
hollow
among
some
low
hills
in
which
the
boers
had
taken
up
their
position
had
we
taken
the
road
we
should
have
walked
right
into
the
trap
which
they
had
evidently
laid
for
us
and
should
have
got
slaughtered
the
firing
we
heard
was
an
exchange
of
compliments
between
these
boers
and
some
dozen
australians
who
had
also
been
sent
out
on
reconnaissance
duty
and
who
had
posted
themselves
on
a
hill
opposite
finding
that
they
did
not
want
any
assistance
we
pushed
on
and
joined
the
brigade
again
at
about
camping
shortly
afterwards
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
the
spot
we
camped
at
was
the
one
that
heard
the
first
shots
fired
during
the
jameson
raid
the
boer
still
exist
and
were
occupied
that
night
by
having
no
transport
we
had
to
depend
on
whatever
we
had
in
our
and
were
consequently
on
rather
short
commons
and
the
horses
too
fared
badly
poor
beasts
having
to
subsist
mostly
on
what
grass
they
could
pick
up
on
the
veldt
and
on
such
and
mealies
as
we
could
get
out
of
the
farmhouses
we
passed
the
latter
were
very
few
and
far
between
in
that
part
of
the
country
next
day
we
continued
our
march
in
the
same
direction
and
both
flanking
parties
engaged
the
snipers
on
several
occasions
the
imperial
light
horse
reported
having
killed
one
boer
and
wounded
four
others
on
the
we
acted
as
advance
guard
and
had
not
proceeded
far
when
we
found
ourselves
wound
up
with
five
lord
lord
general
and
a
column
under
colonel
had
all
been
with
us
bent
on
surrounding
de
wet
but
the
boer
leader
of
a
lost
cause
proved
as
slippery
as
ever
and
had
again
escaped
nek
towards
rustenburg
the
valley
we
had
passed
through
was
mainly
occupied
by
english
and
german
farmers
who
complained
bitterly
at
the
constant
visits
of
english
and
boer
troops
as
sympathy
of
any
kind
with
either
cause
got
them
into
hot
water
with
the
other
side
and
the
boers
are
past
masters
as
looters
the
good
people
of
rustenburg
were
in
a
like
predicament
hence
its
evacuation
we
heard
at
a
store
here
that
de
wet
had
passed
through
the
previous
day
with
our
men
in
close
pursuit
later
we
were
informed
that
he
had
got
through
nek
which
he
had
found
unoccupied
and
that
now
the
place
was
strongly
held
by
the
boers
in
the
evening
i
understand
the
various
generals
got
into
consultation
and
it
was
decided
that
general
ian
hamilton
should
advance
with
his
division
to
attack
the
nek
and
continue
the
chase
after
de
wet
while
lord
kitchener
and
the
others
were
i
believe
to
proceed
to
the
west
of
rustenburg
where
the
boers
under
de
la
rey
were
again
giving
trouble
we
joined
general
ian
hamilton
that
evening
and
next
day
the
whole
force
marched
in
the
direction
of
nek
and
got
within
a
few
miles
of
it
by
about
that
afternoon
as
it
was
so
late
and
the
place
was
said
to
be
so
strongly
held
general
ian
hamilton
decided
on
deferring
his
attack
till
next
day
before
we
camped
for
the
night
the
advance
scouts
got
into
touch
with
the
enemy
and
we
heard
several
exchanges
of
shots
going
on
in
front
shortly
afterwards
we
were
moved
up
in
support
and
stayed
till
dark
after
which
we
went
back
to
camp
which
had
been
pitched
about
two
miles
off
leaving
a
strong
mounted
picket
behind
horse
alone
supplied
forty
men
writing
about
picket
duty
reminds
me
that
it
was
particularly
trying
during
this
march
since
leaving
pretoria
we
had
been
supplying
forty
or
fifty
men
nearly
every
about
per
cent
of
our
number
this
duty
we
hated
more
than
any
other
one
did
not
mind
hard
work
all
day
if
nights
in
camp
were
undisturbed
but
to
come
in
at
dark
and
hardly
have
time
to
before
being
ordered
to
fall
in
for
outlying
picket
was
simply
ghastly
on
some
occasions
we
went
out
without
any
food
or
drink
and
if
as
often
happens
the
post
was
a
long
way
off
and
difficult
to
find
in
the
dark
fellow
messmen
were
unable
to
take
anything
out
whenever
possible
however
or
army
rations
and
biscuits
were
served
out
to
the
picket
before
it
marched
off
and
when
this
was
done
things
were
not
so
bad
the
boer
camp
fires
were
seen
quite
distinctly
on
the
hills
close
to
where
our
pickets
were
and
from
the
number
of
these
we
judged
that
the
report
that
the
nek
was
strongly
held
was
not
an
exaggerated
one
it
is
naturally
a
grand
place
to
defend
and
could
be
made
almost
impregnable
i
should
think
with
its
high
commanding
kopjes
on
either
side
besides
which
it
was
said
to
have
been
strongly
fortified
by
colonel
kekewich
some
time
before
we
naturally
thought
therefore
that
we
should
have
a
hard
nut
to
crack
next
day
just
before
dawn
however
a
spy
who
had
been
sent
into
the
boer
camp
returned
with
the
news
that
they
had
been
on
the
move
all
night
getting
away
their
baggage
and
that
they
would
not
offer
any
very
great
resistance
to
our
just
enough
to
allow
their
convoy
ample
time
to
get
away
this
man
by
the
way
while
returning
from
the
boer
camp
ran
into
our
outlying
picket
and
not
being
prompt
in
replying
to
the
challenge
comes
there
he
very
nearly
got
shot
the
report
that
most
of
the
boers
had
stolen
away
turned
out
to
be
correct
as
after
a
few
shelling
to
clear
the
way
for
our
infantry
the
latter
advanced
practically
unopposed
the
casualties
on
either
side
being
very
few
and
we
got
through
the
nek
about
we
saw
some
very
pretty
artillery
practice
two
guns
coming
into
action
at
a
range
of
three
or
four
miles
quite
close
to
where
we
stood
as
de
wet
was
said
to
have
gone
off
in
the
direction
of
rustenburg
we
pressed
forward
got
outside
that
town
in
the
afternoon
and
camped
there
for
the
night
once
more
evidently
fresh
news
of
the
one
was
received
as
next
day
august
we
started
back
the
way
we
had
come
and
halted
in
the
afternoon
as
if
for
a
long
rest
at
sterkstroom
some
miles
west
of
commando
nek
we
had
hardly
been
in
camp
an
hour
when
the
order
came
for
brigade
to
saddle
up
and
march
at
once
the
object
being
to
intercept
de
wet
who
was
reported
to
have
taken
up
a
position
near
the
crocodile
river
we
did
a
long
weary
march
the
weariness
being
accentuated
by
the
fact
that
we
were
not
allowed
to
smoke
or
speak
above
a
whisper
we
halted
about
and
camped
at
a
place
called
bokfontein
about
five
miles
west
of
the
crocodile
i
presume
it
was
not
thought
advisable
to
advance
any
closer
for
fear
of
blundering
into
the
enemy
unawares
and
thus
giving
them
the
chance
of
getting
away
under
cover
of
darkness
with
all
these
precautions
and
preparations
we
naturally
thought
we
were
really
there
or
thereabouts
this
time
once
again
however
we
were
baffled
of
our
prey
which
we
heard
next
evening
had
got
away
in
a
direction
we
arrived
at
commando
nek
at
on
the
and
it
was
then
decided
that
brigade
should
reconnoitre
the
kopjes
north
of
and
directly
opposite
to
the
nek
and
this
we
proceeded
to
do
general
ian
hamilton
had
not
come
up
then
on
approaching
the
position
we
found
that
there
were
two
ranges
of
kopjes
lying
east
and
west
each
range
being
divided
again
into
several
little
groups
of
hills
and
through
these
there
was
a
passage
leading
to
the
open
country
beyond
a
squadron
of
the
imperial
light
horse
was
sent
out
to
scout
and
they
presently
put
up
some
boers
but
a
few
shells
sent
among
these
soon
drove
them
back
again
horse
were
then
ordered
to
gallop
forward
and
occupy
the
first
group
of
kopjes
on
the
western
ranges
we
had
hardly
got
into
position
when
we
saw
a
large
convoy
of
boer
waggons
making
its
way
as
fast
as
the
oxen
could
be
goaded
to
travel
from
the
kopje
on
the
east
to
the
plains
beyond
and
towards
another
range
of
kopjes
further
north
we
immediately
sent
back
word
to
general
mahon
and
he
at
once
ordered
the
guns
to
be
brought
up
and
a
few
shells
were
sent
after
the
convoy
unfortunately
however
we
only
had
a
battery
of
with
us
and
by
the
time
they
got
into
position
the
convoy
had
a
long
start
and
our
shells
fell
short
general
mahon
reluctantly
decided
that
it
would
be
unsafe
to
follow
the
convoy
with
the
small
force
at
his
disposal
as
the
boers
had
no
doubt
left
a
sufficient
number
of
men
behind
on
the
eastern
and
western
ranges
of
kopjes
to
cover
its
retreat
these
kopjes
completely
commanded
the
plains
beyond
and
had
we
gone
on
we
should
have
been
absolutely
at
their
mercy
and
should
have
been
very
roughly
handled
indeed
besides
which
i
fancy
general
orders
were
merely
to
reconnoitre
the
position
and
not
to
run
his
neck
into
any
kind
of
noose
abandoning
all
idea
of
pursuit
therefore
general
mahon
then
proceeded
to
examine
the
eastern
range
of
kopjes
from
which
the
convoy
had
started
and
where
he
suspected
there
might
be
a
boer
laager
to
effect
this
purpose
he
sent
out
the
new
zealanders
as
scouts
they
were
allowed
to
approach
within
fifty
yards
without
molestation
when
all
of
a
sudden
the
of
mausers
was
heard
all
along
the
ridge
and
an
officer
and
three
men
were
seen
to
fall
the
former
died
next
day
poor
fellow
after
this
the
scouts
returned
from
our
position
on
the
kopjes
on
the
left
we
saw
the
whole
thing
distinctly
a
party
of
new
zealanders
before
this
happened
were
examining
a
farmhouse
and
while
they
were
inside
one
of
their
horses
got
away
the
farmhouse
was
quite
close
to
the
hill
from
which
the
boers
were
firing
and
when
the
retirement
took
place
the
unfortunate
man
who
had
lost
his
horse
would
have
been
left
had
not
one
of
his
comrades
very
pluckily
ridden
forward
and
caught
the
animal
which
was
grazing
close
by
and
thus
enabled
its
owner
to
get
away
the
plucky
scout
however
stayed
to
take
up
behind
his
saddle
another
man
whose
horse
had
been
killed
and
they
also
managed
to
get
clear
off
notwithstanding
that
they
were
being
shot
at
all
the
while
captain
taylor
our
adjutant
who
was
looking
through
his
telescope
at
the
time
said
it
was
the
neatest
and
coolest
thing
he
had
ever
seen
it
was
now
getting
on
in
the
afternoon
and
the
purpose
for
which
as
i
presume
we
were
sent
out
being
complete
the
order
to
retire
was
given
horse
being
instructed
to
act
as
rearguard
and
occupy
the
kopjes
where
they
were
posted
till
the
guns
and
the
rest
of
the
troops
had
got
away
this
we
did
and
we
heard
afterwards
from
the
men
in
charge
of
the
ambulance
which
was
left
behind
to
bring
in
the
wounded
that
we
had
hardly
left
the
kopjes
we
had
been
on
all
day
when
the
boers
occupied
them
we
got
back
to
our
camp
at
commando
nek
late
in
the
afternoon
and
stayed
there
for
the
night
this
was
the
most
irritating
action
we
have
yet
been
in
for
the
boer
convoy
was
at
our
mercy
but
we
were
not
numerically
strong
enough
to
attack
it
it
thus
slipped
away
under
our
very
noses
was
at
commando
nek
and
ian
hamilton
a
march
in
rear
it
was
arranged
that
next
day
general
brigade
should
make
an
attack
on
the
position
reconnoitred
that
morning
supported
by
ian
hamilton
who
was
to
join
us
again
with
the
rest
of
his
division
horse
were
to
take
up
the
same
position
as
they
had
done
the
day
before
the
brigade
marched
out
at
and
were
soon
on
the
scene
of
the
previous
action
as
instructed
we
posted
ourselves
on
the
kopjes
occupied
by
us
the
day
before
and
in
the
meantime
scouts
were
sent
out
to
discover
whether
or
not
the
boers
were
still
about
the
crack
of
mausers
soon
decided
this
question
and
the
kopjes
in
front
and
on
both
flanks
were
then
shelled
for
several
hours
we
were
then
ordered
to
leave
our
rocky
perches
and
advance
in
skirmishing
order
to
the
attack
we
soon
arrived
on
the
kopjes
previously
held
by
the
boers
but
found
no
trace
of
these
gentry
who
had
evidently
played
their
usual
game
of
leaving
a
few
snipers
behind
to
hinder
our
advance
while
their
main
body
got
away
in
safety
this
effected
the
snipers
themselves
vanished
into
space
there
were
no
casualties
on
our
side
that
morning
and
i
do
not
fancy
our
shells
did
much
damage
as
i
did
not
hear
of
any
dead
or
wounded
boers
being
found
it
was
about
here
that
de
wet
was
supposed
to
have
broken
up
his
commando
leaving
some
dismounted
men
to
take
refuge
in
the
bushveldt
while
he
went
off
south
with
only
men
meantime
general
ian
hamilton
came
up
with
his
troops
and
the
whole
of
us
then
advanced
north
the
direction
taken
by
the
fleeing
boers
into
the
bushveldt
expecting
a
fight
at
any
time
which
did
not
come
off
the
going
was
extremely
difficult
the
soil
being
impalpable
sand
with
thorny
bushes
growing
so
close
together
that
at
twenty
yards
objects
could
not
be
discerned
water
was
only
encountered
at
one
spot
a
farm
in
a
valley
the
occupants
of
the
farm
were
a
boer
woman
and
two
little
children
she
weepingly
informed
us
that
the
boers
had
commandeered
her
husband
the
day
before
and
as
he
had
objected
they
had
taken
him
away
in
handcuffs
we
made
zoutpans
by
sundown
completely
jaded
and
worn
out
at
zoutpans
are
the
now
at
a
standstill
as
the
company
owning
them
have
gone
into
liquidation
and
the
only
house
is
that
in
which
the
manager
an
englishman
lives
a
pool
highly
impregnated
with
salt
was
the
only
water
near
at
hand
and
on
this
men
and
horses
had
to
do
the
salt
itself
from
these
mines
is
only
fit
for
cattle
as
soda
predominates
in
it
we
had
marched
more
or
less
in
a
circle
next
day
we
heard
that
de
wet
had
doubled
back
with
picked
men
to
the
free
state
leaving
the
rest
of
his
force
to
join
grobler
who
was
then
operating
north
of
pretoria
we
were
told
that
general
paget
was
coming
up
with
a
small
force
along
the
line
of
rail
and
who
had
left
commando
nek
would
advance
parallel
with
and
ten
miles
west
of
paget
and
that
ian
division
then
about
twelve
miles
further
west
was
to
with
these
two
columns
and
keep
grobler
from
breaking
back
if
possible
we
were
now
in
what
is
called
the
country
covered
with
low
scrubby
bushes
these
bushes
form
excellent
screens
for
the
enemy
and
scouting
therefore
is
ticklish
work
dunno
where
you
are
as
they
say
water
was
a
scarce
article
fact
it
was
about
the
driest
country
we
had
been
in
so
far
passing
a
place
called
stinkwater
we
reached
swartzkop
late
in
the
evening
and
camped
there
for
the
night
near
a
large
settlement
of
the
barotse
tribe
the
germans
have
a
mission
in
these
parts
their
church
is
only
a
large
mud
hut
but
the
missionary
in
charge
has
a
following
of
no
fewer
than
we
were
told
that
night
that
general
ian
hamilton
was
going
with
his
staff
to
kraal
a
railway
station
about
fifteen
miles
east
coming
back
the
same
evening
and
that
horse
were
to
act
as
his
escort
this
promised
a
nice
break
in
the
monotony
of
the
everlasting
march
march
march
we
had
been
having
lately
so
those
of
us
who
had
fit
horses
were
much
elated
the
unfortunate
ones
who
had
not
being
correspondingly
downcast
as
arranged
we
started
for
kraal
at
daybreak
next
day
and
our
advance
scouts
had
got
quite
six
miles
out
when
we
were
ordered
to
turn
back
and
return
to
camp
trooper
philip
stanley
writes
of
an
incident
that
occurred
at
a
farm
near
the
german
mission
and
which
may
help
to
explain
how
some
of
the
wonderful
yarns
we
so
often
heard
about
de
capture
commenced
illustration
bourne
philip
stanley
we
were
catching
the
fowls
in
the
houses
round
the
church
and
one
particular
cock
evaded
all
our
endeavours
so
somebody
called
him
de
wet
and
presently
yelled
out
as
the
poor
cock
was
hurt
by
a
stick
or
stone
captured
at
curiously
enough
just
at
that
moment
a
mounted
man
a
hussar
i
think
was
riding
close
past
us
on
the
road
and
heard
the
shout
captured
at
last
and
i
think
must
have
spread
the
report
as
when
we
got
into
camp
four
miles
on
about
an
hour
and
a
half
afterwards
we
were
at
once
told
de
wet
was
captured
at
last
and
i
think
they
might
that
evening
have
added
fresh
instructions
had
evidently
come
from
headquarters
and
general
ian
hamilton
was
not
going
to
kraal
after
all
when
we
got
back
to
our
place
we
found
the
division
moving
off
in
a
northerly
direction
and
so
after
a
few
halt
to
water
our
horses
we
had
to
follow
on
as
quickly
as
possible
to
regain
our
place
in
the
on
the
flank
of
the
guns
it
was
a
very
hot
and
dirty
march
and
towards
the
afternoon
our
position
was
changed
to
rearguard
which
meant
that
we
had
to
wait
behind
till
all
the
stragglers
and
the
whole
of
the
transport
got
into
camp
in
consequence
we
did
not
get
in
till
that
night
and
even
then
our
troubles
were
not
ended
as
several
of
us
were
immediately
ordered
out
on
outlying
picket
the
different
corps
take
it
in
turn
to
do
rearguard
as
a
rule
and
needless
to
say
it
is
not
a
popular
duty
at
all
generally
the
rearguard
gets
off
supplying
outlying
pickets
but
when
or
when
there
are
more
posts
than
usual
they
too
have
to
bear
their
share
of
the
burden
the
next
march
august
brought
us
to
warmbaths
as
its
name
indicates
there
are
natural
springs
here
some
of
the
enterprising
ones
of
the
earth
taking
advantage
of
this
have
erected
long
rows
of
bathing
houses
supplied
with
every
convenience
hot
and
cold
water
taps
and
before
the
war
broke
out
i
understand
they
were
making
a
good
thing
out
of
it
it
was
a
great
resort
for
invalids
i
was
told
and
being
on
the
line
of
rail
from
pretoria
it
was
quite
the
thing
to
spend
a
few
days
out
there
and
take
the
waters
when
we
came
in
we
found
the
baths
entirely
deserted
no
one
being
left
in
charge
of
them
there
were
any
number
of
troops
in
the
place
when
we
arrived
and
lot
having
come
in
the
day
before
they
had
had
several
brushes
with
the
enemy
under
grobler
and
had
driven
them
on
to
the
hills
beyond
the
town
as
can
easily
be
imagined
there
was
a
regular
rush
on
the
baths
each
room
being
in
most
cases
engaged
six
deep
many
of
us
in
consequence
had
to
defer
tubbing
till
next
day
which
we
spent
resting
in
camp
i
was
one
of
these
oh
i
shall
never
forget
the
luxury
of
that
bath
i
think
i
spent
a
whole
hour
lying
full
length
in
a
tub
of
hot
water
with
just
my
chin
above
the
surface
when
one
only
gets
the
opportunity
of
bathing
on
rare
occasions
it
is
perhaps
not
surprising
that
one
should
wax
enthusiastic
over
one
such
as
this
was
that
we
been
used
to
luxuries
was
fully
demonstrated
by
the
number
of
men
who
were
suffering
with
colds
the
next
day
we
started
again
with
ian
hamilton
on
the
evening
of
the
leaving
generals
paget
and
behind
to
settle
with
grobler
and
his
merry
band
whom
as
i
have
written
above
they
had
already
harried
considerably
our
march
was
in
the
direction
of
pretoria
and
everybody
in
the
column
then
heard
for
the
first
time
that
we
were
merely
going
there
to
refit
and
get
remounts
after
which
we
should
be
sent
out
in
the
direction
of
middelburg
alas
for
our
hopes
that
this
was
to
have
been
our
last
trek
miles
of
bushveldt
had
to
be
traversed
to
reach
the
next
camp
at
eccentric
stream
the
meandering
of
which
caused
us
considerable
inconvenience
in
crossing
and
it
a
dozen
times
during
the
march
we
reached
river
station
that
night
and
camped
there
starting
again
next
day
we
got
to
kraal
about
midday
and
halted
there
for
two
or
three
hours
we
heard
here
that
our
mails
we
had
any
since
leaving
pretoria
at
the
beginning
of
the
month
so
expected
a
good
pile
had
been
sent
on
from
pretoria
to
meet
us
and
they
were
a
mile
or
two
ahead
about
a
dozen
of
us
were
accordingly
sent
to
get
them
there
were
eight
or
ten
bags
for
us
and
we
immediately
the
pleasant
task
of
sorting
it
took
us
a
good
two
hard
work
and
this
will
give
some
idea
of
the
number
of
letters
and
parcels
received
continuing
our
march
we
reached
waterval
station
late
in
the
afternoon
and
halted
for
the
night
this
it
will
be
remembered
was
where
the
boers
kept
our
men
whom
they
had
taken
prisoners
after
they
removed
them
from
the
racecourse
at
pretoria
they
were
confined
in
long
tin
sheds
placed
in
the
middle
of
a
large
barbed
wire
enclosure
and
this
was
lighted
up
by
electric
light
all
night
thus
reducing
the
chances
of
escape
to
a
minimum
we
marched
at
next
morning
and
at
arrived
in
pretoria
where
we
camped
on
the
racecourse
shortly
afterwards
we
were
joined
by
captain
clifford
and
the
men
about
twenty
who
had
been
left
behind
at
irene
owing
to
their
having
no
horses
and
also
by
several
others
who
had
been
in
hospital
and
were
now
convalescent
among
the
latter
was
regimental
marsham
who
was
looking
remarkably
well
after
all
he
had
gone
through
he
had
had
some
remarkable
experiences
shot
in
two
places
through
the
chest
and
right
thigh
besides
having
a
bullet
through
his
haversack
in
our
first
fight
at
houtnek
then
being
taken
prisoner
at
rhenoster
river
station
where
he
was
on
his
way
up
to
rejoin
the
regiment
after
leaving
hospital
then
having
the
pleasure
of
being
present
at
the
surrender
of
prinsloo
and
three
or
four
thousand
of
his
men
and
forming
one
of
the
guard
which
escorted
them
afterwards
we
were
all
greatly
pleased
to
have
him
back
among
us
again
we
had
had
a
trying
time
of
it
and
stevenson
cast
our
horses
wholesale
nearly
being
cast
in
all
the
men
seem
made
of
sterner
stuff
and
campaigning
has
only
tended
to
make
the
majority
fitter
than
ever
and
only
a
very
few
are
matter
of
the
survival
of
the
fittest
we
have
been
working
in
with
brigade
a
good
deal
and
our
desire
to
hear
about
him
and
to
see
him
has
been
surfeited
the
only
hardship
experienced
on
the
march
was
want
of
good
tobacco
though
the
magaliesberg
tobacco
is
considered
the
best
of
transvaal
tobacco
and
we
could
have
obtained
plenty
of
it
yet
few
among
us
have
acquired
a
taste
for
it
it
is
positively
vile
and
an
indian
cigar
when
smoked
in
a
pipe
is
probably
the
nearest
approach
to
it
some
more
changes
have
taken
place
among
us
trooper

months
been

many

trooper
follett
died
of
enteric
at
johannesburg
while
quite
twenty
or
men
have
been
invalided
home
there
is
little
doubt
that
a
famine
in
the
transvaal
will
result
from
this
war
foodstuffs
are
at
a
premium
while
the
expected
crops
have
been
all
destroyed
in
the
large
towns
like
pretoria
johannesburg
bread
is
only
baked
from
flour
supplied
by
government
and
even
then
the
prevailing
price
is
a
shilling
for
a
pound
loaf
necessities
such
as
tea
coffee
and
sugar
are
now
hard
to
procure
while
beet
has
risen
to
two
shillings
a
pound
mealies
for
horses
can
not
be
bought
under
threepence
the
pound
the
beginning
of
a
famine
would
thus
be
the
precursor
of
the
end
of
the
war
glancing
at
a
map
one
would
be
inclined
to
think
places
indicated
in
capitals
and
small
capitals
to
be
important
towns
as
a
matter
of
fact
each
is
but
a
cluster
of
houses
a
store
or
two
the
inevitable
church
and
an
hotel
this
is
typical
of
places
like
rustenburg
heilbron
middelburg
carolina
kroonstad
brandfort
and
pretoria
are
but
larger
clusters
more
hotels
and
more
churches
the
latter
certainly
possess
some
really
excellent
public
buildings
the
private
villas
are
charming
and
suggest
the
cum
while
the
state
artillery
barracks
are
reputed
to
be
the
finest
in
the
world
johannesburg
is
the
one
town
of
the
transvaal
and
can
hold
its
own
against
the
world
but
it
must
not
be
forgotten
that
the
uitlander
alone
has
made
it
what
it
is
as
a
sink
of
iniquity
it
has
the
unenviable
distinction
of
ranking
second
only
to
san
francisco
gambling
saloons
abut
on
to
the
streets
and
at
some
gambling
is
restricted
to
gold
alone
one
can
imagine
what
johannesburg
must
have
been
under
a
corrupt
government
such
as
the
one
we
have
just
rand
a
succession
of
being
practically
suburban
johannesburg
sports
a
at
every
fifty
yards
and
it
is
the
refuse
of
the
rand
that
forms
the
nucleus
of
the
band
of
outlaws
and
desperadoes
known
as
the
irish
brigade
ruffians
the
very
antithesis
of
this
contingent
are
known
as
the
imperial
light
horse
who
have
been
so
highly
complimented
by
sir
george
white
as
constituting
the
finest
fighting
men
in
the
world
very
characteristic
of
the
dashing
and
humorous
leader
under
whom
horse
served
in
this
march
is
the
following
story
told
by
captain
beresford
i
remember
one
very
wet
cold
day
when
we
were
attached
to
column
while
on
the
march
a
sergeant
and
two
men
were
told
off
to
go
and
forage
for
some
provisions
coming
across
a
boer
farm
they
helped
themselves
to
a
turkey
or
two
and
some
poultry
now
it
happened
that
general
ian
hamilton
the
day
previous
had
paid
for
what
his
men
took
so
the
boer
was
loud
in
his
protestation
but
all
the
satisfaction
he
could
get
from
our
men
was
general
will
general
mahon
passing
shortly
after
the
man
presented
his
bill
which
amounted
to
fifteen
shillings
on
seeing
it
the
general
made
inquiries
as
to
which
corps
the
foraging
party
belonged
to
and
being
told
sent
for
an
officer
of
the
corps
and
requested
to
pay
the
bill
but
as
the
officer
had
not
fifteen
shillings
about
him
the
general
very
kindly
lent
him
the
money
till
he
could
obtain
it
from
his
and
men
who
found
out
then
that
the
general
would
not
be
universal
provider
footnote
lord
force
went
to
relieve
colonel
hore
at
chapter
xvi
to
belfast
and
barberton
under
generals
french
and
after
such
a
march
in
which
horses
had
become
so
emaciated
by
want
of
sufficient
food
to
sustain
them
and
so
from
incessant
work
under
heavy
burdens
that
more
than
of
them
were
temporarily
unfit
for
service
the
corps
naturally
expected
to
get
a
long
rest
at
pretoria
nearly
every
man
needed
it
too
and
welcomed
the
prospect
of
a
little
town
life
in
touch
with
civilisation
where
some
luxuries
might
be
enjoyed
and
experiences
exchanged
with
comrades
from
other
columns
ragged
and
out
at
heels
from
being
having
marched
long
distances
through
tangled
growth
of
rhenoster
bushes
and
thorns
to
relieve
their
exhausted
steeds
these
troopers
naturally
looked
forward
to
the
chance
of
clothing
themselves
in
comfort
if
the
stores
of
pretoria
should
be
equal
to
that
demand
or
at
any
rate
of
waiting
until
articles
of
kit
could
be
got
up
from
the
bases
where
these
things
had
been
left
such
expectations
were
natural
enough
in
the
case
of
men
who
began
to
think
there
would
be
no
more
need
of
their
services
since
lord
roberts
had
expressed
an
opinion
that
regular
warfare
was
nearly
at
an
end
circumstances
seemed
then
to
justify
that
view
though
de
wet
was
still
at
large
he
did
not
count
for
much
while
his
followers
were
scattered
in
all
directions
with
little
chance
of
coming
together
again
forces
offering
but
a
feeble
resistance
at
any
point
had
been
pushed
further
and
further
eastward
by
generals
french
and
operating
in
their
front
and
the
army
of
natal
on
their
flank
buller
had
fought
his
brilliant
action
at
bergendal
where
lord
roberts
considered
the
success
decisive
saying
was
carried
out
in
view
of
the
main
boer
position
and
the
effect
of
it
was
such
that
the
enemy
gave
way
at
all
points
flying
in
confusion
to
the
north
and
east
next
morning
buller
was
able
to
occupy
machadodorp
without
brigade
of
irregular
cavalry
had
pushed
on
in
pursuit
of
the
boers
through
mountainous
country
where
they
made
no
stand
against
him
buller
continuing
his
march
occupied
waterval
boven
where
the
prisoners
released
from
nooitgedacht
joined
him
president
kruger
and
other
members
of
the
late
transvaal
government
were
at
nelspruit
preparing
for
flight
across
the
portuguese
frontier
and
general
french
was
at
carolina
waiting
only
for
reinforcements
to
make
his
swoop
on
barberton
by
way
of
the
last
stronghold
that
remained
in
the
hands
south
of
the
delagoa
bay
railway
it
looked
indeed
as
if
boer
resistance
on
any
organised
scale
must
be
near
its
final
stage
and
the
thoughts
of
horse
naturally
turned
towards
home
rather
than
to
opportunities
for
gaining
fresh
distinction
their
hopes
of
immediate
peace
with
honour
were
however
doomed
to
disappointment
before
they
had
been
in
pretoria
many
hours
orders
for
a
fresh
move
had
reached
them
and
instead
of
having
leisure
for
relaxation
or
even
a
taste
of
comforts
they
had
to
spend
the
next
day
in
drawing
from
stores
the
outfit
of
which
they
were
sorely
in
need
and
making
other
preparations
for
their
march
their
mahon
was
to
go
in
command
of
reinforcements
for
general
french
and
the
troops
placed
at
his
disposal
were
m
battery
royal
horse
artillery
the
corps
of
mounted
infantry
queensland
mounted
infantry
new
zealand
mounted
rifles
company
imperial
yeomanry
the
imperial
light
horse
and
horse
the
order
came
to
them
in
a
form
which
left
no
doubt
in
any
mind
that
there
was
still
a
work
to
be
done
and
that
they
were
about
to
take
part
in
another
important
phase
of
the
great
boer
war
therefore
they
put
aside
all
vain
regrets
for
the
things
that
were
just
then
out
of
reach
disappointment
gave
place
quickly
to
gratification
at
the
thought
that
they
were
to
see
service
under
such
a
dashing
leader
as
general
french
who
had
never
up
to
that
time
met
the
boers
without
bringing
them
to
action
and
whose
reputation
rose
higher
after
every
enterprise
undertaken
by
him
though
he
was
not
always
allowed
to
take
full
advantage
of
a
success
by
following
up
his
beaten
enemies
the
boers
who
attributed
every
british
success
in
the
free
state
and
transvaal
to
luck
or
to
overwhelming
numbers
had
given
to
french
the
title
of
the
they
said
it
was
by
luck
alone
that
he
beat
commandant
koch
at
elandslaagte
before
their
reinforcements
could
come
up
luck
according
to
them
served
him
again
in
the
hour
of
his
secret
withdrawal
from
colesberg
just
before
de
la
plans
for
annihilation
were
complete
and
yet
again
when
he
made
his
dash
at
interposing
forces
north
of
modder
river
and
striking
at
the
very
point
where
they
were
weakest
got
through
just
in
the
nick
of
time
took
their
positions
in
reverse
and
thus
cleared
a
way
for
the
relief
of
kimberley
if
all
this
can
be
called
luck
then
it
is
something
to
be
a
lucky
general
and
goes
a
long
way
in
justification
of
the
faith
that
napoleon
placed
in
men
who
had
that
reputation
at
any
rate
no
boer
commandos
were
very
eager
to
get
in
the
way
of
french
and
whenever
he
was
known
to
be
operating
on
their
flank
they
always
thought
it
time
to
summon
thither
one
of
their
own
generals
most
trusted
for
his
ability
to
conduct
a
retreat
that
luck
fell
more
than
once
to
de
la
lot
in
a
recent
conversation
that
redoubtable
leader
the
best
fighting
man
of
all
on
the
boer
side
told
the
editor
of
this
history
that
it
was
he
who
opposed
french
at
driefontein
after
surrender
he
also
had
to
fight
all
the
rearguard
actions
up
to
the
time
of
our
crossing
the
vaal
when
he
went
off
in
hot
haste
for
the
purpose
of
intercepting
column
before
it
could
reach
mafeking
having
been
there
he
was
called
back
to
aid
botha
outside
johannesburg
and
entrusted
again
with
the
task
of
delaying
flanking
movement
by
the
defence
of
klipriviersberg
until
the
boer
guns
and
convoys
could
make
good
their
retreat
obviously
they
did
not
think
it
safe
to
trust
anything
to
chance
when
our
was
pressing
them
but
sent
their
wiliest
tactician
and
most
stubborn
fighter
to
hold
him
in
play
while
they
cleared
off
if
any
of
them
really
believed
in
their
capacity
to
beat
french
on
equal
advantage
of
ground
being
with
them
to
counterbalance
british
superiority
in
admirable
opportunity
offered
in
the
mountainous
ranges
of
the
kantoor
where
boer
leaders
had
frequently
declared
they
would
crush
any
force
attempting
to
reach
barberton
that
way
if
properly
held
the
positions
there
would
have
been
almost
impregnable
few
people
to
this
day
know
the
difficulties
that
french
had
before
him
when
he
concentrated
his
force
at
carolina
the
boers
knew
all
about
these
things
every
track
like
a
winding
stair
up
the
precipitous
was
familiar
to
them
they
knew
also
the
object
with
which
he
was
waiting
to
gather
strength
at
carolina
and
they
brought
forces
against
him
that
were
little
inferior
numerically
to
his
own
yet
when
at
last
he
struck
straight
for
almost
inaccessible
mountain
passes
instead
of
making
a
wide
detour
to
get
round
them
they
were
so
paralysed
by
the
audacity
that
they
let
him
have
his
way
which
led
by
the
nearest
track
to
barberton
this
slight
digression
however
anticipates
events
which
may
now
be
dealt
with
more
fully
in
the
narratives
by
colonel
lumsden
his
officers
and
troopers
whose
experiences
and
observations
are
woven
together
in
the
following
description
of
events
in
something
like
proper
sequence
we
were
by
this
time
reduced
to
forty
fit
horses
our
stay
in
pretoria
as
we
had
heard
it
would
be
was
only
a
short
one
the
day
after
arriving
in
camp
we
were
served
out
with
new
kit
of
which
we
were
sadly
in
need
most
of
the
men
being
in
a
very
ragged
condition
indeed
general
mahon
was
to
proceed
to
carolina
and
join
general
division
there
leaving
general
ian
division
to
which
we
were
no
longer
attached
it
rained
heavily
the
night
before
we
started
and
as
we
marched
at
daybreak
there
was
no
time
to
dry
our
blankets
which
were
simply
sopping
wet
our
total
muster
on
parade
company
b
company
in
all
the
balance
of
nearly
men
under
captain
beresford
were
to
follow
on
receipt
of
remounts
and
overtake
us
if
possible
this
hope
was
soon
knocked
on
the
head
for
while
headquarters
started
with
general
mahon
for
barberton
the
remainder
were
sent
to
machadodorp
which
they
reached
without
much
adventure
a
fortnight
later
notwithstanding
their
repeated
attempts
to
join
us
their
wishes
were
not
acceded
to
the
country
being
considered
too
dangerous
for
a
small
party
to
move
alone
on
the
we
reached
bronkhurst
spruit
memorable
in
the
transvaal
as
the
spot
where
british
troops
under
colonel
anstruther
were
badly
cut
up
in
the
last
war
while
marching
all
unconscious
that
war
had
been
declared
against
the
transvaal
on
september
we
passed
balmoral
and
camped
at
elandsfontein
on
the
near
the
transvaal
and
delagoa
bay
a
french
gentleman
was
good
enough
to
communicate
the
latest
boer
lie
it
was
that
china
was
sending
a
million
of
troops
to
invade
england
the
country
about
here
is
very
treacherous
with
many
swamps
which
unwary
troopers
may
not
see
until
they
are
floundering
in
mire
where
their
horses
sink
to
the
girths
our
camp
that
night
was
at
reitspruit
six
miles
from
middelburg
the
next
day
we
passed
middelburg
which
proved
a
grievous
disappointment
for
there
was
absolutely
nothing
in
the
way
of
provisions
procurable
and
camped
at
reitpan
the
weather
was
very
hot
the
sun
striking
down
with
great
force
during
the
middle
of
the
day
general
mahon
had
adopted
the
plan
of
and
halting
for
two
or
three
hours
during
the
heat
of
the
day
instead
of
marching
steadily
from
to
with
short
halts
of
ten
minutes
every
now
and
then
this
gave
man
and
beast
a
thorough
rest
and
the
opportunity
was
always
taken
of
making
tea
and
coffee
and
partaking
of
this
with
the
inevitable
jam
and
biscuits
the
horses
too
had
a
good
feed
of
oats
which
were
served
out
in
the
morning
and
carried
in
our
nosebags
captain
noblett
got
a
nasty
touch
of
the
sun
two
or
three
days
before
arriving
at
middelburg
and
the
doctors
decided
that
he
ought
to
go
into
hospital
there
being
quite
unfit
to
continue
on
the
march
we
were
very
sorry
to
lose
him
as
he
was
one
of
our
most
popular
officers
speaking
for
no
section
b
company
anyhow
i
know
they
swore
by
him
to
a
man
we
heard
afterwards
that
he
had
gone
to
durban
for
a
change
and
it
is
to
be
hoped
he
will
soon
be
back
again
with
us
the
fourth
march
brought
us
in
contact
with
general
line
of
communications
and
we
were
apprised
of
the
annexation
of
the
transvaal
with
this
good
news
we
buoyed
ourselves
up
and
brought
a
dreary
march
to
a
close
at
wonderfontein
the
boers
are
whimsical
at
names
but
have
surpassed
themselves
with
wonderfontein
for
the
wonder
of
it
is
where
to
find
the
fountain
speculation
was
rife
as
the
pools
of
water
we
saw
were
so
putrid
that
the
horses
though
they
had
done
thirteen
miles
from
the
last
would
not
drink
till
accident
disclosed
a
tiny
spring
in
a
bed
of
sand
just
deep
enough
to
fill
a
coffee
cup
at
a
time
here
was
the
wonder
and
we
had
struck
it
the
was
an
eventful
day
for
when
we
had
marched
eastward
three
miles
a
heliogram
from
a
contingent
of
canadians
on
the
line
of
communications
solicited
help
as
they
were
hard
pressed
by
boers
near
pan
station
where
they
had
been
fighting
since
daybreak
files
about
and
canter
was
the
order
and
we
went
back
some
six
miles
to
their
aid
but
the
enemy
had
beaten
a
retreat
after
capturing
a
small
post
where
they
crept
up
through
a
dense
fog
and
surprised
the
helpless
picket
we
returned
to
wonderfontein
and
general
mahon
in
consideration
of
the
call
made
on
us
very
generously
ordered
an
issue
of
a
quarter
of
a
pound
of
and
a
biscuit
lunch
la
south
and
much
appreciated
thus
refreshed
we
continued
on
our
march
for
some
five
or
six
miles
and
camped
for
the
night
such
a
night
we
have
never
had
the
wind
blew
a
perfect
hurricane
and
it
was
bitterly
cold
on
the
the
brigade
reached
carolina
and
we
were
in
expectation
of
seeing
a
town
where
we
could
renew
our
diminished
stock
of
provisions
but
alas
carolina
in
africa
is
very
different
from
the
carolina
of
the
south
carolina
is
a
sultry
clime
where
the
niggers
work
in
the
summer
time
massa
in
the
shade
would
lay
while
we
poor
niggers
work
all
day
with
us
it
was
not
summer
time
but
massa
had
to
lie
on
the
bleak
veldt
and
pretty
hungry
too
we
found
general
french
in
camp
near
by
us
with
two
brigades
a
foreign
commando
of
austrians
and
italians
was
said
to
be
in
the
neighbourhood
and
we
hoped
to
become
better
acquainted
with
it
later
on
carolina
is
a
small
uninteresting
sort
of
place
more
a
village
than
anything
else
the
houses
being
small
and
built
of
corrugated
iron
it
is
about
the
windiest
place
i
have
ever
been
in
we
were
there
nearly
a
week
and
it
blew
a
hurricane
almost
all
the
time
one
day
it
rained
as
well
and
this
made
it
horribly
chilly
blast
cutting
into
one
like
a
knife
even
the
hardy
cape
ponies
who
had
never
before
in
their
lives
known
what
it
was
to
be
blanketed
had
to
be
covered
up
that
day
another
of
the
charms
of
this
delightful
place
is
that
it
is
most
dangerous
to
send
horses
out
grazing
on
the
surrounding
veldt
as
there
is
a
low
poisonous
bush
which
grows
pretty
plentifully
on
it
to
eat
which
is
almost
certain
death
we
found
this
out
by
bitter
experience
losing
four
or
five
horses
before
we
left
the
first
march
from
carolina
took
us
over
a
ridge
by
nelspruit
where
we
witnessed
a
very
pretty
engagement
the
enemy
had
taken
up
a
position
on
top
of
a
hill
crossed
by
three
deep
ravines
at
right
angles
to
our
line
of
advance
this
was
stormed
by
the
suffolk
infantry
while
we
acted
as
escort
to
the
guns
which
shelled
the
enemy
severely
as
they
left
the
shelter
of
the
last
ridge
when
turned
out
of
their
last
stronghold
they
retired
by
ones
and
twos
under
severe
shrapnel
fire
at
range
which
gave
us
an
in
mounted
infantry
tactics
at
carolina
with
general
french
and
his
cavalry
we
halted
two
days
and
resumed
our
advance
on
sunday
the
we
had
heard
that
the
boers
were
in
the
vicinity
and
it
was
not
long
before
we
met
them
for
about
six
miles
we
marched
across
the
absolutely
flat
veldt
and
then
with
extraordinary
suddenness
the
scene
changed
and
we
found
ourselves
among
steep
and
rugged
hills
here
was
ideal
country
for
the
boers
to
fight
in
and
they
speedily
let
us
know
of
their
presence
they
had
taken
up
a
strong
position
among
rocks
and
boulders
on
the
further
side
of
a
hollow
some
yards
across
together
with
a
part
of
a
squadron
of
the
hussars
who
like
ourselves
had
been
unable
to
get
remounts
in
pretoria
so
that
their
numbers
were
reduced
about
per
were
escorting
the
guns
m
battery
swung
and
had
opened
fire
in
next
to
no
time
the
whole
battery
and
also
two
being
placed
in
line
along
the
ridge
and
all
pounding
away
at
the
rocky
kopje
or
rather
series
of
kopjes
from
which
the
boers
were
firing
at
our
infantry
the
suffolk
regiment
who
now
opened
out
and
advancing
to
within
good
rifle
range
took
what
cover
they
could
find
and
engaged
the
enemy
it
was
a
grand
sight
watching
the
play
of
the
guns
and
cheer
after
cheer
rang
through
the
lines
as
each
shot
fell
in
rapid
succession
right
in
among
the
boers
scattering
them
like
startled
sheep
the
guns
did
splendid
work
the
range
was
accurate
and
the
shells
perfect
but
a
grander
sight
still
was
to
watch
tommy
advancing
he
does
it
in
a
most
casual
way
with
his
rifle
slung
at
ease
over
his
shoulder
you
see
individuals
in
khaki
stumbling
over
rocks
and
boulders
then
a
thin
line
of
khaki
in
the
distance
then
nothing
for
tommy
is
resting
the
thin
khaki
line
again
becomes
visible
as
he
proceeds
in
the
coolest
manner
in
the
world
till
the
order
to
fire
is
given
nothing
is
then
visible
but
the
sounds
of
volley
after
volley
and
independent
firing
tell
you
the
infantry
are
in
the
thick
of
a
fight
as
the
mounted
infantry
advance
through
the
gaps
in
their
lines
tommy
cheerily
calls
out
have
it
having
placed
our
horses
in
a
nullah
out
of
the
way
of
stray
or
two
of
which
came
whistling
had
nothing
to
do
but
watch
the
progress
of
the
fight
and
a
capital
view
we
had
especially
of
our
artillery
in
action
the
enemy
had
no
guns
in
position
here
so
our
guns
could
devote
themselves
to
shelling
the
rocks
among
which
the
boers
were
lying
the
boulders
afforded
them
excellent
cover
and
they
stuck
to
it
exceedingly
well
the
weak
point
in
their
position
lay
in
the
fact
that
the
cover
of
which
they
had
taken
advantage
was
down
the
near
side
of
the
slope
so
in
the
event
of
their
being
forced
to
retire
they
would
have
to
ride
or
run
up
three
or
four
hundred
yards
of
bare
hillside
before
they
topped
the
ridge
for
about
five
hours
the
fight
continued
by
this
time
our
infantry
had
got
comparatively
close
and
the
boers
decided
not
to
wait
for
them
suddenly
they
were
seen
issuing
from
the
dip
where
their
horses
had
been
hidden
in
twos
and
threes
and
batches
of
various
sizes
and
scattering
up
the
hillside
with
the
naked
eye
one
could
see
little
black
dots
streaming
away
in
all
directions
it
looked
for
all
the
world
like
a
disturbed
nest
the
guns
now
redoubled
their
exertions
loading
and
firing
all
they
knew
the
shells
dropping
in
every
direction
among
the
retreating
boers
in
retiring
they
had
to
go
down
to
the
bottom
of
the
dip
where
they
had
left
their
horses
and
up
the
slope
on
the
other
distance
of
about
yards
i
should
say
when
once
they
got
to
the
top
of
this
slope
they
were
more
or
less
safe
as
they
could
take
cover
among
the
rocks
there
and
get
away
to
the
hilly
country
beyond
but
while
going
up
the
slope
they
were
quite
exposed
to
the
fire
from
our
batteries
general
mahon
was
there
in
person
giving
instructions
to
the
officer
in
charge
of
the
guns
which
were
kept
playing
on
the
spot
as
fast
as
the
gunners
could
load
and
fire
watching
through
glasses
we
could
see
three
or
four
bowled
over
they
must
have
had
an
uncomfortable
ride
until
they
topped
the
ridge
though
probably
not
many
were
hit
as
we
know
from
our
own
experience
how
ineffective
even
a
shell
fire
often
is
however
on
crossing
over
we
found
where
one
dead
boer
had
been
hastily
buried
also
a
dead
horse
and
other
signs
that
our
shell
fire
had
not
been
without
results
a
of
the
boers
now
came
into
action
and
for
about
an
hour
before
sundown
shelled
our
convoy
at
extreme
range
without
doing
any
damage
throughout
the
day
the
cavalry
had
been
engaged
on
our
right
and
had
suffered
some
casualties
our
brigade
had
had
or
so
one
of
the
imperial
yeomanry
was
killed
and
two
were
wounded
and
three
of
the
imperial
light
horse
were
wounded
in
the
afternoon
we
advanced
and
occupied
the
position
previously
held
by
the
boers
who
had
retreated
some
distance
they
had
a
with
them
and
they
treated
us
to
a
few
shells
but
these
went
high
over
our
heads
and
burst
a
long
way
behind
without
doing
any
damage
shortly
after
this
as
it
was
getting
dark
we
camped
for
the
night
as
we
were
preparing
to
camp
the
boers
shelled
our
convoy
with
a
long
tom
they
still
possess
but
their
shells
fell
wide
and
were
harmless
we
camped
for
the
night
at
buffalo
spruit
the
casualties
were
nine
wounded
scots
greys
one
wounded
imperial
horse
boers
about
fifteen
killed
wounded
unknown
the
was
an
uneventful
day
but
on
the
horse
supplied
an
outlying
picket
consisting
of
our
entire
strength
through
some
error
the
picket
manned
the
wrong
kopje
and
as
they
could
not
be
found
next
morning
were
reported
as
captured
we
turned
up
however
late
in
the
day
at
the
camp
on
the
komati
river
and
followed
rapidly
in
the
track
of
the
advancing
troops
we
were
now
on
with
de
kaap
mountains
looming
before
us
the
roadway
being
in
places
as
steep
as
one
in
eight
and
the
enemy
strongly
posted
along
the
summit
on
the
the
advance
was
made
at
and
by
m
battery
was
again
pounding

the
road
to
barberton
slopes
gradually
up
from
the
plains
round
carolina
for
about
feet
if
i
remember
right
when
it
takes
a
sudden
upward
turn
for
about
a
couple
of
miles
before
reaching
the
top
of
de
kaap
mountains
over
which
it
winds
and
then
descends
again
about
to
feet
the
town
being
situated
in
a
hollow
surrounded
by
hills
on
all
sides
the
last
bit
of
a
couple
of
miles
or
so
is
what
is
called
the
kantoor
the
gradient
is
about
one
in
four
as
far
as
i
could
judge
and
this
will
give
some
idea
of
the
job
our
generals
had
to
tackle
if
the
boers
elected
to
hold
this
place
as
it
was
reported
they
were
going
to
do
it
was
simply
an
ideal
place
to
defend
and
they
were
said
to
have
a
long
tom
in
things
generally
looked
uncomfortable
to
say
the
least
of
it
scouting
that
day
looked
like
being
an
even
poorer
game
than
usual
anything
but
a
demoralised
force
would
have
made
a
strong
stand
in
such
a
position
the
main
advance
was
against
its
front
while
the
cavalry
executed
a
turning
movement
to
the
right
with
such
effect
that
the
position
was
gained
almost
without
a
shot
the
climb
was
terrific
so
bad
was
it
that
only
just
managed
to
get
up
with
double
teams
and
all
the
baggage
had
to
be
left
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
the
troops
however
pushed
on
to
the
top
only
to
witness
a
sight
on
the
range
opposite
at
about
yards
was
a
high
laager
half
a
mile
square
a
dense
mass
of
cattle
and
waggons
out
of
which
the
latter
were
seen
streaming
away
towards
swaziland
between
us
and
them
lay
a
deep
valley
while
the
road
curving
round
to
the
left
was
commanded
by
three
guns
rendering
serious
attack
in
that
direction
inadvisable
the
imperial
light
horse
made
a
gallant
attempt
to
get
round
but
were
not
strong
enough
we
all
looked
to
see
the
gun
come
up
and
play
havoc
with
the
laager
but
the
naval
officer
in
command
declared
his
oxen
unable
to
bring
the
gun
up
the
precipitous
ascent
leaving
us
the
mortification
of
seeing
the
enemy
escape
under
our
very
eyes
it
was
some
gratification
however
to
eventually
capture
of
their
waggons
many
thousand
sheep
and
some
oxen
by
the
time
we
had
dragged
up
our
guns
and
got
them
into
position
the
fugitives
were
out
of
range
as
a
few
shells
sent
in
their
direction
proved
but
the
captured
waggons
contained
stores
of
various
kinds
sugar
flour
and
this
made
a
welcome
addition
to
our
commissariat
which
was
running
very
short
of
supplies
it
took
four
days
to
get
the
whole
of
the
transport
up
the
kantoor
during
this
time
the
bulk
of
the
division
halted
as
they
could
not
move
without
supplies
to
form
some
estimate
of
the
difficulties
of
transport
up
these
mountains
i
would
mention
that
the
boers
were
confident
that
we
could
never
get
our
convoy
and
guns
up
for
among
them
the
steepest
part
is
described
as
a
place
where
if
a
leading
team
of
oxen
come
to
a
stop
they
are
hurled
back
on
to
the
waggon
to
clear
these
mountains
in
four
days
reflects
the
greatest
credit
on
that
department
the
transport
sergeant
power
of
horse
excelled
on
the
occasion
for
fearing
he
could
not
possibly
get
the
up
that
night
he
unloaded
the
carts
and
used
the
mules
with
pack
saddles
thus
enabling
horse
to
sleep
with
blankets
when
the
rest
of
the
brigade
were
blanketless
poor
fellows
in
such
circumstances
it
needs
no
telling
that
we
went
to
sleep
supperless
as
our
rations
were
at
the
foot
of
the
mountain
and
the
troops
on
its
summit
directly
the
road
was
clear
general
french
with
two
cavalry
brigades
advanced
rapidly
and
leaving
the
boers
who
were
retreating
southwards
alone
he
pushed
on
to
barberton
some
fifteen
miles
distant
guided
by
one
of
the
imperial
light
horsemen
he
avoided
the
road
down
into
the
plain
in
which
barberton
is
situated
which
it
is
enemy
were
quite
prepared
to
defend
and
using
a
across
the
hills
supposed
to
be
impracticable
for
horses
he
descended
suddenly
on
the
town
and
captured
it
without
opposition
the
enemy
were
completely
surprised
and
fled
leaving
engines
with
standing
in
the
station
a
large
quantity
of
stores
and
in
specie
the
day
following
general
occupation
of
the
town
a
boer
convoy
consisting
of
fifty
waggons
walked
in
under
the
impression
that
it
was
still
in
their
hands
general
brigade
with
the
infantry
were
left
to
guard
homolomo
while
the
convoy
came
up
the
gradient
was
something
like
one
in
four
so
you
can
imagine
what
a
business
it
was
getting
the
heavy
waggons
up
twelve
and
fourteen
horses
were
required
to
get
the
lighter
guns
up
while
the
naval
gun
had
eighty
oxen
harnessed
to
it
and
many
a
poor
beast
fell
out
and
died
under
the
strain
on
the
third
day
we
continued
our
march
all
day
we
were
descending
gradually
leaving
the
hills
behind
until
we
eventually
came
out
into
an
enormous
plain
the
kaap
valley
here
we
halted
and
waited
for
the
transport
who
had
had
another
trying
day
we
had
descended
feet
during
the
day
and
the
difference
in
temperature
was
most
noticeable
in
this
part
of
the
country
the
hot
weather
is
just
beginning
the
nights
are
quite
mild
and
the
sun
at
midday
is
scorching
on
sunday
the
we
marched
to
within
a
couple
of
miles
of
the
town
and
camped
it
is
a
straggling
little
place
built
close
under
and
partly
on
the
lower
slopes
of
a
spur
of
the
kaapsche
berg
this
is
a
well
watered
part
of
the
country
and
fruit
growing
appears
to
be
a
paying
industry
pretoria
and
johannesburg
being
markets
normal
quantity
of
fruit
is
easily
disposed
of
on
the
fruit
farms
here
we
noticed
several
old
indian
plantains
pineapples
and
papiya
when
we
got
into
barberton
we
found
that
general
french
had
gone
on
towards
komati
poort
on
the
portuguese
border
in
which
direction
the
boers
had
fled
and
we
heard
shortly
afterwards
that
about
of
them
had
taken
refuge
in
lourenço
marques
having
given
up
their
arms
and
destroyed
a
number
of
their
big
guns
before
crossing
the
border

barberton
is
quite
an
indian
town
in
many
respects
not
only
is
the
madrassi
native
common
but
mango
banana
loquat
fig
and
other
indian
fruit
trees
abound
east
africa
seems
to
my
mind
to
be
the
indian
eldorado
for
not
only
does
he
wax
fat
and
opulent
but
he
abandons
his
indian
garb
and
struts
about
in
that
of
western
civilisation
he
does
not
get
on
well
with
the
kaffir
but
has
pushed
himself
forward
and
now
occupies
a
higher
position
among
white
men
than
he
would
presume
to
in
india
in
all
other
respects
however
barberton
is
a
very
english
town
and
owes
its
origin
to
the
de
kaap
goldfields
it
was
here
that
the
boers
housed
the
women
and
children
who
were
sent
to
them
from
johannesburg
and
pretoria
and
in
consequence
every
house
in
the
town
is
packed
full
of
these
refugees
it
was
also
at
barberton
that
the
dorset
yeomanry
and
the
remaining
british
prisoners
were
confined
after
their
removal
from
nooitgedacht
at
present
the
improvised
place
of
confinement
is
being
used
as
a
prison
for
the
boers
themselves
the
latest
official
bulletin
announces
the
complete
demoralisation
of
the
boer
army
which
is
termed
a
rabble
and
speculation
is
rife
as
to
the
probable
date
of
our
disbandment
last
night
it
was
announced
in
orders
that
anyone
desirous
of
joining
the
pretoria
police
at
a
day
could
do
so
at
once
the
chances
of
a
commission
at
the
end
of
three
months
were
held
out
but
only
four
names
were
given
in
the
majority
intend
going
to
england
a
very
few
have
decided
to
remain
in
africa
while
some
twenty
or
thirty
chiefly
coffee
planters
from
southern
india
are
returning
to
india
the
summer
is
on
us
and
the
days
are
very
in
the
shade
we
have
no
tents
but
the
ingenious
ones
erect
a
bivouac
of
blankets
supported
on
posts
and
rifles
as
a
shelter
from
the
sun
yesterday
a
cricket
match
was
played
between
and
brigades
resulting
in
an
easy
win
for
the
latter
sergeant
pratt
represented
horse
in
team
another
correspondent
writes
besides
the
usual
camp
duties
we
had
to
supply
outlying
pickets
and
patrols
turn
about
with
the
other
volunteers
and
regular
regiments
twenty
or
thirty
of
us
used
to
be
sent
out
to
a
post
five
or
six
miles
out
in
the
morning
from
these
posts
we
sent
out
patrols
forage
parties
during
the
day
and
outlying
pickets
at
night
one
of
these
posts
was
situated
right
on
the
top
of
one
of
the
hills
beyond
the
town
it
was
a
tremendous
climb
and
took
most
of
us
at
least
an
hour
to
get
to
it
lugging
blankets
coats
and
rations
up
there
was
no
joke
and
i
am
glad
to
say
we
only
had
to
do
it
once
during
our
stay
there
was
a
beautiful
wood
with
a
nice
mountain
stream
running
through
it
about
a
mile
and
a
half
from
camp
where
we
used
to
send
our
horses
down
to
graze
and
water
and
we
always
took
the
opportunity
of
having
a
delightful
bathe
or
of
washing
clothes
at
which
we
were
by
this
time
becoming
experts
a
daily
bath
was
a
luxury
we
had
not
been
accustomed
to
before
for
months
so
we
appreciated
it
accordingly
after
our
bath
we
lounged
under
the
shade
of
the
trees
till
it
was
time
to
take
the
horses
back
to
camp
again
grazing
guard
in
these
circumstances
was
rather
a
favourite
duty
as
up
in
camp
it
was
fearfully
hot
our
only
protection
from
the
sun
being
small
blanket
shelter
tents
which
were
not
really
much
good
these
tents
were
made
out
of
two
blankets
or
a
blanket
and
a
waterproof
sheet
the
blankets
and
waterproof
sheets
served
out
to
the
army
have
on
both
sides
and
at
the
ends
so
one
can
put
up
a
tent
very
easily
and
quickly
all
the
materials
required
being
a
few
pegs
easily
cut
from
an
old
or
from
any
other
wood
which
may
be
obtainable
a
little
string
and
a
couple
of
rifles
these
last
forming
the
supports
at
either
end
owing
to
the
great
heat
we
move
the
position
of
our
camps
once
a
week
what
with
dead
horses
and
cattle
the
air
is
absolutely
putrid
and
a
precaution
most
imperative
on
the
march
the
foul
smells
encountered
are
terrible
owing
to
the
number
of
dead
horses
and
cattle
lying
on
the
highway
from
pretoria
to
balmoral
we
passed
as
many
as
two
or
three
hundred
carcases
in
different
stages
of
decomposition
the
very
water
is
often
polluted
and
considerable
inconvenience
is
the
consequence
in
a
previous
letter
i
incidentally
mentioned
veldt
fires
but
at
the
crocodile
river
camp
it
was
our
luck
to
be
in
the
thick
of
one
and
that
at
midnight
we
had
made
the
camp
at
sundown
and
as
darkness
set
in
we
were
enraptured
with
the
pyrotechnic
display
of
the
surrounding
kopjes
on
fire
it
was
a
magnificent
sight
though
awful
by
the
camp
was
hushed
in
slumber
except
for
stable
pickets
when
the
wind
shifted
and
blew
the
flames
towards
the
camp
gradually
the
veldt
near
us
took
fire
till
at
midnight
we
were
completely
surrounded
the
roar
was
appalling
while
myriads
of
insects
filled
the
air
the
situation
was
one
needing
immediate
action
as
every
moment
was
precious
to
your
horses
and
saddle
up
were
the
orders
anxiously
given
all
was
hurriedly
folding
up
blankets
kaffir
boys
running
about
conducting
oxen
to
inspan
bodies
of
men
running
towards
the
fast
approaching
flames
carrying
blankets
to
beat
them
down
in
the
midst
of
all
a
patrol
of
the
hussars
were
seen
completely
cut
off
from
the
camp
and
surrounded
with
flaming
veldt
a
rush
was
made
and
hundreds
of
blankets
soon
cleared
a
space
and
the
patrol
emerged
the
horses
showing
every
sign
of
terror
it
was
an
anxious
time
but
in
half
an
hour
all
was
safe
and
the
flames
had
been
successfully
diverted
from
their
course
of
destruction
such
a
fire
in
the
back
veldt
it
would
have
been
impossible
to
cope
with
on
the
western
veldt
these
fires
destroy
complete
herds
of
cattle
annually
and
are
much
dreaded
illustration
the
laundry
a
sketch
by
one
day
at
barberton
four
of
us
were
on
observation
post
when
four
boers
came
along
the
road
they
were
immediately
challenged
and
told
to
show
their
passes
which
they
did
they
then
sat
down
to
rest
alongside
us
one
of
them
named
meyers
could
talk
english
perfectly
and
when
he
found
we
were
of
horse
he
said
he
had
escorted
one
of
our
fellows
from
ospruit
to
pretoria
a
prisoner
and
shared
two
bottles
of
whisky
he
then
told
us
the
boers
knew
exactly
when
we
were
at
spytfontein
how
many
men
went
on
picket
every
night
and
how
many
we
were
all
told
he
also
said
on
april
the
brigade
adjutant
rode
up
within
twenty
yards
of
him
he
shouted
to
williams
to
surrender
and
he
shouted
back
am
damned
if
i
do
and
galloped
off
meyers
fired
all
his
magazine
at
the
english
officer
but
missed
him
lieutenant
williams
has
since
been
killed
at
bothaville
barberton
was
simply
crammed
with
stores
of
all
sorts
the
boers
having
used
it
as
a
supply
depôt
for
some
time
past
it
was
a
great
treat
being
able
to
get
luxuries
in
the
shape
of
extra
sugar
tea
coffee
sweets
again
after
such
an
age
and
at
reasonable
rates
too
pretoria
was
entirely
denuded
of
these
things
and
i
remember
hunting
without
success
round
the
whole
town
for
sugar
the
day
before
we
left
on
our
last
march
matches
were
not
to
be
had
there
at
any
price
whereas
here
we
could
buy
them
at
sixpence
a
dozen
boxes
i
think
we
appreciated
these
more
than
anything
else
we
had
felt
the
want
of
them
tremendously
during
the
past
two
or
three
months
english
tobacco
unfortunately
was
unobtainable
so
we
had
to
content
ourselves
with
the
boer
very
poor
substitute
i
think
most
of
us
agreed
though
i
dare
say
when
one
got
accustomed
to
it
one
would
prefer
it
personally
i
never
want
to
see
or
smell
the
beastly
stuff
again
barberton
itself
is
a
small
town
situated
at
the
bottom
of
de
kaap
mountains
and
more
or
less
surrounded
by
hills
on
the
hills
forming
its
background
are
the
various
mines
which
were
opened
out
when
gold
was
first
discovered
here
then
came
the
rush
of
the
rand
mines
and
barberton
was
left
standing
the
roads
leading
to
these
mines
wind
up
and
round
the
hillsides
and
must
have
taken
months
and
months
of
hard
work
to
complete
i
should
think
the
houses
are
built
of
wood
and
roofed
with
corrugated
iron
for
the
most
part
and
are
very
small
one
wonders
how
people
manage
to
exist
in
them
in
the
summer
months
when
the
temperature
is
almost
if
not
quite
as
high
as
it
is
in
india
and
damp
to
boot
it
was
getting
very
hot
before
we
left
early
in
october
and
the
old
familiar
limp
feeling
which
began
to
pervade
all
ranks
brought
back
memories
of
hot
weather
in
india
barberton
is
essentially
a
british
town
and
until
lately
when
the
boers
used
it
as
a
city
of
refuge
for
their
wives
and
families
the
inhabitants
were
practically
all
british
by
blood
if
not
by
birth
the
community
must
have
been
a
fairly
rough
one
in
the
old
days
and
one
can
imagine
many
wild
orgies
taking
place
among
the
miners
more
or
less
cut
off
as
they
were
from
civilisation
fruits
of
all
sorts
grow
here
indian
as
well
as
gooseberries
oranges
lemons
vegetables
too
beautiful
for
our
horses
was
obtainable
in
the
fields
for
the
first
week
or
so
that
we
were
in
barberton
you
will
be
sorry
to
hear
of
the
death
from
enteric
fever
at
johannesburg
hospital
of
private
follett
the
elder
of
the
two
joined
with
the
mysore
contingent
since
then
i
regret
to
say
we
have
had
another
death
from
of
private
maclaine
surma
valley
light
horse
who
died
of
acute
pneumonia
in
pretoria
hospital
transport
driver
martyn
some
months
ago
was
run
over
and
badly
injured
we
are
sorry
to
hear
that
he
has
since
died
of
the
injuries
he
then
received
one
way
and
another
a
good
many
have
left
the
regiment
a
certain
number
of
those
left
behind
sick
and
wounded
have
been
unable
to
rejoin
the
regiment
and
have
been
invalided
home
among
them
privates
cooper
and
butler
from
madras
both
of
whom
were
taken
ill
at
kroonstad
the
former
suffering
from
pneumonia
and
the
latter
from
pleurisy
also
private
bewsher
from
mysore
who
was
wounded
in
the
knee
at
elandsfontein
station
two
days
before
the
surrender
of
johannesburg
our
ten
days
at
barberton
gave
a
welcome
rest
after
many
weary
marches
the
time
was
enlivened
with
dances
and
hunting
with
buckhounds
for
the
officers
and
cricket
for
whoever
could
be
spared
it
was
here
that
colonel
lumsden
had
his
unfortunate
accident
he
was
riding
back
in
the
dark
from
afternoon
tea
at
a
neighbouring
camp
and
being
deceived
by
the
light
of
a
picket
fire
rode
straight
into
a
nullah
the
picket
luckily
for
him
heard
the
noise
of
the
fall
and
by
the
light
of
a
candle
went
in
search
finding
horse
and
man
prostrate
the
horse
was
dead
and
colonel
lumsden
insensible
the
good
fellows
however
did
their
best
and
taking
him
up
to
the
fire
discovered
by
his
badges
that
he
belonged
to
horse
one
of
them
came
into
our
camp
to
report
bringing
us
the
information
about
the
doctor
and
ambulance
immediately
proceeded
to
the
scene
of
the
accident
and
patching
him
up
temporarily
took
him
away
to
the
boer
hospital
in
barberton
by
the
light
of
day
it
appeared
wonderful
that
anyone
could
have
escaped
death
from
such
an
accident
the
nullah
may
almost
be
described
as
a
fissure
in
the
ground
some
feet
wide
and
measured
deep
the
only
thing
that
saved
our
life
was
that
the
horse
evidently
alighted
on
his
feet
taking
the
brunt
of
the
fall
himself
and
paying
the
penalty
with
his
life
this
was
shown
by
the
fact
that
the
saddle
was
not
injured
in
any
way
colonel
lumsden
writes
of
this
incident
in
a
letter
from
barberton
hospital
dated
october
well
eight
days
ago
i
visited
town
and
was
riding
back
to
my
camp
at
dusk
when
my
charger
a
splendid
paced
and
mannered
cape
horse
simply
cantered
right
into
a
donga
feet
deep
breaking
his
neck
in
the
fall
while
i
lay
by
his
side
bruised
and
insensible
luckily
for
me
some
pickets
were
close
by
and
heard
the
smash
recognising
me
by
my
badge
they
went
to
my
camp
and
brought
our
doctor
and
adjutant
to
the
spot
they
took
me
to
our
camp
for
treatment
and
in
a
few
time
our
doctor
with
the
assistance
of
troopers
who
volunteered
to
carry
the
stretcher
conveyed
me
into
the
barberton
club
the
temporary
boer
hospital
ours
being
both
full
up
the
boer
doctor
and
nurses
have
been
kindness
itself
to
me
and
have
done
everything
in
their
power
to
make
me
comfortable
how
i
escaped
with
my
life
my
usual
good
luck
only
knows
i
was
bashed
cut
and
bruised
but
not
a
limb
or
a
bone
broken
four
days
ago
i
nearly
snuffed
out
from
a
flow
of
blood
from
my
nose
and
mouth
but
fortunately
it
was
stopped
in
time
and
i
really
believe
did
me
good
as
i
had
too
much
blood
in
my
system
now
more
than
enough
about
myself
i
am
on
the
right
track
and
hope
to
be
with
my
men
in
a
few
days
more
i
follow
on
with
the
hospital
train
the
day
after
and
pick
them
up
at
machadodorp
for
which
place
they
leave
there
we
pick
up
captain
beresford
with
of
my
men
they
stayed
at
pretoria
a
day
beyond
us
to
get
remounts
came
on
with
my
friend
general
infantry
division
and
were
never
able
to
rejoin
us
we
being
in
advance
with
general
mounted
brigade
months
afterwards
colonel
lumsden
by
the
following
tribute
showed
that
he
had
not
forgotten
those
who
had
tended
him
with
so
much
care
to
incidents
which
i
have
already
related
of
kindly
treatment
at
the
hands
of
boer
doctors
and
nurses
i
may
add
another
of
which
i
was
on
this
occasion
the
recipient
i
awoke
the
morning
after
my
serious
accident
feeling
very
stiff
and
sore
and
found
myself
lying
in
the
general
ward
amid
wounded
tommies
and
boers
i
must
have
been
insensible
for
nearly
twelve
hours
next
day
powell
our
regimental
doctor
wished
to
remove
me
to
one
of
our
own
hospitals
but
bidenhamp
the
boer
doctor
offered
to
give
me
a
small
room
to
myself
if
i
remained
which
i
gratefully
accepted
and
could
not
have
wished
for
better
care
or
attention
than
i
received
at
his
hands
and
those
of
his
assistant
haumann
i
have
also
to
thank
very
gratefully
sister
alma
meyer
of
grosvenor
house
stellenbosch
for
the
kindly
treatment
she
accorded
me
as
well
as
two
dutch
sisters
from
holland
who
were
assisting
her
in
the
hospital
and
acting
nobly
to
briton
and
boer
alike
and
i
take
this
opportunity
of
acknowledging
with
sincere
thanks
their
careful
treatment
and
kindness
to
me
during
the
ten
days
i
was
their
patient
ruling
passions
are
strong
even
when
one
is
at
door
and
i
can
not
help
recalling
a
sporting
bet
i
had
with
my
kind
friend
sister
alma
it
took
the
usual
shape
of
a
bet
with
a
i
laid
her
a
dozen
pairs
to
nothing
that
the
war
would
be
over
by
christmas
which
not
only
i
but
many
high
in
authority
fully
believed
it
would
we
were
passing
durban
on
our
way
back
to
india
during
the
second
week
in
december
and
taking
the
then
situation
i
looked
upon
my
bet
as
lost
and
bailed
up
one
of
my
subalterns
who
was
landing
there
to
return
to
the
seat
of
war
kindly
carried
out
my
commission
and
forwarded
the
gloves
to
the
winner
from
whom
i
received
a
prompt
acknowledgment
with
the
usual
remark
that
women
are
always
right
and
i
believe
they
are
at
least
i
never
attempt
to
contradict
them
and
yet
i
am
a
bachelor
colonel
lumsden
being
in
hospital
and
debarred
therefore
to
his
regret
from
leading
the
corps
in
a
march
for
which
it
had
already
been
detailed
major
chamney
took
temporary
command
and
a
few
days
later
received
orders
to
hand
over
horses
and
proceed
by
train
to
rejoin
the
other
detachment
under
captain
beresford
at
machadodorp
this
uneventful
stage
of
the
campaign
is
thus
described
by
the
correspondent
of
an
indian
paper
serving
with
horse
prior
to
this
the
imperial
light
horse
had
left
brigade
and
we
heard
that
they
too
expected
to
be
disbanded
shortly
general
mahon
made
them
a
speech
before
they
left
praising
them
highly
for
the
good
work
they
had
done
while
with
him
and
saying
how
sorry
he
was
to
part
with
them
on
october
we
handed
over
nearly
all
our
horses
to
the
new
zealanders
keeping
only
such
of
or
five
if
i
remember
had
been
brought
from
india
and
come
right
through
the
whole
show
four
others
also
were
kept
for
the
cart
the
horses
he
had
before
being
played
out
but
the
experiment
did
not
turn
out
a
success
as
the
first
time
they
were
put
into
harness
they
bolted
and
there
was
a
general
the
leaders
broke
away
and
vanished
into
space
and
were
never
seen
by
us
again
and
the
wheelers
got
mixed
up
in
the
traces
and
upset
the
cart
damaging
it
hopelessly
in
their
struggles
to
get
free
the
doctor
was
thenceforth
cartless
i
think
and
the
implements
of
his
trade
had
to
be
carried
in
one
of
the
transport
carts
after
giving
over
our
horses
we
were
marched
into
town
and
camped
close
to
the
station
for
the
night
the
transport
with
the
heavy
luggage
and
led
horses
were
to
leave
next
day
by
road
for
machadodorp
for
which
place
we
too
were
bound
the
rest
of
the
regiment
under
captain
beresford
had
been
stationed
there
for
some
time
next
morning
we
proceeded
to
the
station
and
loaded
our
saddle
baggage
and
a
few
of
our
small
transport
carts
into
open
trucks
into
which
we
ourselves
afterwards
scrambled
the
train
moving
off
immediately
there
was
not
overmuch
room
but
we
were
not
particular
and
this
did
not
very
greatly
bother
us
after
proceeding
about
sixteen
miles
we
had
to
get
out
and
walk
to
avoca
a
railway
station
about
three
miles
further
on
as
owing
to
the
boers
having
smashed
up
a
bridge
here
the
train
was
unable
to
get
across
waggons
were
awaiting
us
into
which
we
loaded
the
baggage
also
making
use
of
the
transport
carts
we
had
brought
with
us
on
arriving
at
avoca
we
heard
that
an
accident
had
occurred
further
up
the
line
and
we
should
not
therefore
be
able
to
go
on
till
next
day
we
camped
in
the
open
and
spent
a
wretched
night
as
it
rained
incessantly
and
by
daybreak
everything
was
sopping
wet
hearing
next
morning
that
we
would
not
be
leaving
for
some
hours
several
of
us
foraged
round
and
found
an
empty
hut
in
which
we
took
shelter
as
the
rain
still
continued
and
made
ourselves
very
fairly
comfortable
there
was
any
amount
of
firewood
about
so
we
were
able
to
our
blankets
when
the
train
came
in
at
midday
it
was
found
that
there
was
not
room
for
more
than
about
fifteen
of
us
besides
the
saddles
baggage
and
transport
carts
at
kaapmuiden
we
got
on
to
the
main
line
from
komati
poort
to
pretoria
this
junction
presented
a
really
woeful
sight
the
boers
had
evacuated
the
place
in
great
haste
throwing
away
stores
galore
principally
large
quantities
of
flour
which
had
been
rendered
useless
by
sprinkling
it
with
kerosine
making
it
smell
horribly
and
totally
unfitting
it
for
consumption
whole
trains
had
been
burned
as
they
stood
on
the
lines
and
an
idea
of
the
terrible
conflagration
may
be
gathered
from
the
fact
that
the
rails
under
the
wheels
were
buckled
down
by
the
terrific
heat
captain
taylor
in
one
of
his
amusing
reminiscences
pays
a
tribute
to
the
work
done
by
infantry
soldiers
tommy
certainly
is
the
most
wonderful
man
and
quite
prepared
to
do
anything
asked
a
whole
company
of
infantry
being
converted
into
mounted
troops
by
such
an
order
as
company
of
regiment
will
be
mounted
was
at
one
time
quite
usual
but
they
were
fair
troops
in
a
month
one
saw
him
making
bridges
and
diversions
for
the
same
with
the
old
jokes
and
quaint
oaths
or
doing
butcher
baker
slaughterer
tailor
bootmaker
farrier
and
all
the
things
he
is
taught
but
he
fairly
surprised
me
at
barberton
there
we
had
suddenly
arrived
with
a
division
of
cavalry
the
within
a
week
we
had
sent
our
cavalry
as
far
as
point
where
the
barberton
branch
line
meets
the
main
one
from
pretoria
to
komati
poort
our
infantry
had
repaired
the
numerous
bridges
and
culverts
and
we
were
entrained
and
taken
back
to
machadodorp
by
train
every
was
a
junior
british
officer
the
pointsman
tommy
tommy
who
also
worked
the
telegraphs
was
stoker
bridgemaker
platelayer
wheelgreaser
there
were
a
few
accidents
but
not
many
and
a
smash
was
only
a
joke
no
wonder
we
are
hard
to
beat
the
trooper
correspondent
did
not
look
at
things
quite
in
that
light
but
perhaps
he
was
travelling
less
luxuriously
and
the
humorous
side
of
the
situation
did
not
strike
him
so
forcibly
it
was
raining
all
the
time
so
things
generally
were
not
at
all
cheerful
and
the
prospect
of
travelling
for
several
hours
in
open
trucks
under
these
conditions
did
not
help
to
raise
our
spirits
however
it
was
not
so
bad
after
all
as
we
stretched
a
huge
tarpaulin
propped
up
with
sticks
rifles
and
boxes
over
the
truck
we
were
in
which
was
piled
up
to
the
top
with
the
baggage
and
managed
to
keep
the
rain
out
in
this
way
the
rest
of
us
were
to
follow
on
by
the
next
train
we
even
managed
to
get
up
a
game
of
whist
and
this
with
the
perusal
of
such
literature
as
we
had
with
us
and
occasional
snoozes
helped
to
pass
the
time
we
stayed
that
night
at
crocodile
poort
station
it
not
being
considered
safe
to
travel
after
dark
it
stopped
raining
at
so
getting
out
of
the
truck
we
built
a
huge
fire
and
dried
our
blankets
and
boiled
the
inevitable
coffee
we
slept
in
the
open
as
it
was
quite
fine
then
but
the
dew
was
so
heavy
during
the
night
that
everything
got
sopping
wet
again
by
the
morning
we
started
again
at
but
made
very
slow
progress
as
we
had
long
waits
at
various
stations
on
the
way
from
there
to
machadodorp
is
a
most
interesting
and
beautiful
country
the
line
runs
between
two
precipitous
ranges
quite
swiss
in
their
magnificence
with
a
river
running
between
the
hills
then
to
waterval
onder
where
the
ordinary
rails
gave
place
to
a
cogwheel
line
up
a
steep
climb
we
left
again
at
the
following
day
and
passed
through
very
fair
scenery
between
that
place
and
the
next
station
waterval
boven
high
overhanging
kopjes
on
one
side
along
the
bases
of
which
the
line
ran
with
a
deep
sort
of
cañon
between
the
crocodile
river
flowing
along
its
bottom
and
a
large
square
rock
looking
commandingly
from
the
other
in
one
place
the
train
ran
quite
close
to
the
as
in
the
darjiling
himalayan
railway
in
india
and
almost
under
a
huge
mass
of
overhanging
rocks
there
are
deep
fissures
in
these
rocks
in
many
places
and
they
look
as
if
they
might
get
loosened
and
overwhelm
us
at
any
moment
we
were
told
that
in
the
rains
sentries
are
posted
at
this
place
night
and
day
to
give
timely
warning
should
there
be
any
signs
of
the
rocks
shifting
the
incline
too
is
very
steep
here
and
only
a
few
trucks
at
a
time
can
be
taken
up
in
our
case
eleven
trucks
were
sent
up
at
first
two
engines
being
put
on
one
in
front
and
the
other
behind
to
prevent
slipping
the
hindermost
engine
had
the
usual
arrangement
working
on
a
centre
rail
shortly
after
leaving
waterval
onder
you
get
into
a
tunnel
about
a
hundred
yards
long
i
think
it
is
absolutely
unventilated
so
it
can
be
imagined
that
the
smoke
from
the
engines
which
seated
as
we
were
in
open
trucks
simply
poured
down
our
throats
and
up
our
noses
very
nearly
suffocated
us
we
stayed
at
waterval
boven
till
and
then
went
on
to
machadodorp
where
we
found
the
rest
of
the
regiment
which
was
encamped
there
under
captain
beresford
they
had
marched
to
this
place
from
belfast
where
lord
roberts
inspected
them
here
we
were
greatly
undeceived
instead
of
going
on
down
country
for
home
as
we
expected
we
received
orders
to
equip
and
furthermore
to
leave
the
old
brigade
we
were
so
fond
of
under
general
mahon
and
join
general
column
in
general
brigade
the
men
of
horse
arrived
in
the
midst
of
a
very
heavy
hailstorm
like
all
true
soldiers
they
were
ready
to
make
a
jest
of
discomfort
and
seeing
the
company
commander
whose
name
happened
to
be
jim
as
he
crawled
under
the
shelter
of
his
they
struck
up
the
then
popular
chorus
o
lucky
jim
how
i
envy
him
colonel
lumsden
was
at
this
time
speculating
on
the
chances
that
his
corps
might
soon
be
ordered
home
and
in
a
letter
to
sir
patrick
playfair
written
while
still
in
hospital
he
says
ever
since
we
entered
pretoria
on
june
and
marched
through
it
to
irene
it
has
been
even
betting
that
the
war
might
end
any
day
or
keep
on
with
this
kind
of
guerilla
fighting
till
christmas
it
looks
very
like
the
latter
now
i
have
discussed
the
matter
frequently
while
lying
in
my
bed
here
with
colonel
commanding
the
imperial
light
horse
and
colonel
craddock
commanding
the
australian
contingent
both
in
brigade
with
myself
they
fully
hold
my
opinion
that
although
this
unexpected
delay
comes
harder
on
the
volunteer
personally
than
was
anticipated
when
he
joined
yet
it
was
all
in
the
bargain
i
also
assure
the
men
that
government
looks
upon
the
colonial
volunteer
movement
as
much
too
big
a
factor
in
this
crisis
to
be
ignored
or
undervalued
and
that
not
one
day
beyond
what
is
actually
necessary
shall
we
be
kept
in
harness
in
this
country
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
complete
pacification
or
subjugation
of
this
huge
colony
is
a
much
bigger
question
than
we
soundly
tackled
at
the
start
or
were
prepared
to
face
de
wet
and
botha
are
harder
nuts
to
crack
than
we
imagined
i
am
extremely
proud
of
and
pleased
with
the
doings
of
the
corps
and
i
feel
sure
it
has
been
worthy
of
its
honorary
colonel
and
its
many
friends
and
supporters
in
the
land
we
hail
from
how
kind
lord
roberts
has
been
to
us
and
to
me
personally
i
can
hardly
state
here
our
good
fortune
in
the
way
of
obtaining
commissions
in
the
regular
forces
speaks
volumes
on
this
point
besides
other
civil
appointments
already
granted
to
say
nothing
i
hope
of
others
in
store
when
we
disband
as
regards
the
transvaal
police
which
a
number
of
my
men
were
keen
to
join
when
it
started
in
june
i
distinctly
said
until
we
are
disbanded
if
government
would
say
then
do
my
best
for
you
with
commissions
but
until
then
the
terms
were
per
diem
horse
allowance
and
rations
of
course
these
were
tempting
to
men
playing
a
hard
game
on
per
day
but
government
soon
stopped
enrolment
the
new
zealand
government
having
declined
to
let
their
volunteers
join
i
hear
it
is
being
opened
again
to
a
small
extent
mostly
for
mechanics
but
these
are
not
the
class
got
what
they
mean
really
to
do
is
to
make
the
transvaal
and
orange
river
police
the
soldiers
of
the
immediate
future
and
take
all
the
suitable
volunteers
they
can
to
back
it
up
a
right
good
plan
too
and
i
fancy
they
are
only
waiting
for
the
opportune
moment
to
do
so
as
regards
funds
i
feel
sure
we
shall
end
up
well
i
never
lose
a
chance
of
buying
little
extras
for
the
men
in
the
way
of
boer
tobacco
and
tinned
milk
any
quantity
of
the
stores
for
officers
went
astray
and
heaps
were
given
away
to
the
men
i
can
truly
assure
you
the
officers
will
not
make
much
out
of
the
hunt
i
know
what
my
movements
will
or
london
depending
on
that
of
the
corps
at
one
period
our
orders
were
the
latter
to
be
in
the
colonial
volunteer
inspection
by
the
queen
but
i
fear
it
is
too
late
in
the
day
for
that
to
come
off
and
that
it
will
now
be
calcutta
direct
for
all
that
remain
of
us
well
as
you
know
it
is
hard
to
beat
in
the
cold
season
and
always
enjoyable
to
me
so
i
mind
so
ended
the
experiences
of
horse
under
command
they
had
been
with
him
two
months
in
circumstances
that
try
the
mettle
of
men
whether
officers
or
privates
and
their
devotion
to
him
had
increased
day
by
day
in
camp
or
in
action
he
was
always
the
same
never
worrying
himself
or
harassing
his
men
on
the
contrary
he
more
than
once
gave
up
his
own
rough
shelter
in
a
deserted
house
or
hut
so
that
his
troops
might
have
firewood
for
cooking
their
scant
rations
of
tough
mutton
or
horseflesh
their
confidence
in
him
was
unbounded
because
they
said
he
never
got
them
into
a
tight
place
without
knowing
how
to
get
them
out
again
and
they
would
have
followed
him
anywhere
that
was
the
feeling
of
all
ranks
in
the
brigade
for
their
general
his
confidence
in
them
was
equally
firm
in
a
letter
which
the
editor
has
permission
to
quote
that
distinguished
leader
writes
horse
served
with
me
for
some
months
and
a
better
lot
of
men
and
officers
could
not
be

snapshot
by
the
chapter
xvii
and
machadodorp
to
heidelberg
and
pretoria
under
generals
french
and
before
presenting
as
a
connected
whole
the
separate
descriptions
dealing
with
a
movement
which
had
for
its
object
the
disintegration
of
boer
forces
that
still
held
the
high
veldt
and
thus
threatened
both
railway
lines
east
of
johannesburg
it
will
be
well
to
summarise
briefly
the
experience
of
troopers
under
captain
command
while
separated
from
the
headquarters
of
their
corps
it
will
be
remembered
that
when
general
mahon
set
out
from
pretoria
to
join
general
french
in
his
dash
on
barberton
more
than
of
horse
were
left
behind
waiting
for
remounts
with
instructions
to
follow
as
fast
as
possible
or
as
soon
as
general
cunningham
under
whose
orders
they
were
placed
for
a
time
might
permit
what
happened
then
is
especially
interesting
as
evidence
of
the
class
of
horse
that
was
being
issued
to
mounted
troops
at
that
stage
for
operations
against
an
exceedingly
mobile
enemy
the
boers
were
then
practically
nomads
having
no
fixed
bases
from
which
supplies
were
drawn
and
therefore
no
lines
of
communication
to
be
cut
pursuit
of
them
was
therefore
very
much
like
hunting
a
fox
that
has
been
driven
out
of
his
own
familiar
country
if
he
runs
the
pack
of
scent
there
is
nothing
to
serve
as
a
guide
for
the
casts
that
may
be
made
in
hope
of
hitting
off
the
line
again
for
nobody
can
say
what
the
probable
is
and
unless
he
can
be
brought
to
hand
by
a
pursuit
that
never
tires
and
never
goes
wrong
we
may
be
sure
that
there
is
no
chance
of
running
him
to
ground
most
of
the
boer
leaders
at
that
time
had
their
wives
and
families
with
them

to

call
it

and
so
to

troops
with

in

best

condition
could
hope
to
achieve
much
for

in
the
same
plight
as
horse
however
nothing
better
could
be
found
than
argentines

the
combined
effects
of

and
injudicious

broken

therefore
one
trooper
whose
comments
are
based
on
actual
experience
as
he
was
among
the
men
to
whom
horses
were
issued
for
trial
only
on
the
morning
of
the
day
when
they
marched
from
pretoria

put
it
mildly

uncomfortable

had
no

they
answer

it
was
impossible
to
get

away
from
the
when
the

returned
from
its
long
trek
nearly
everybody
was
in
rags

very
unlike

earlier

however
this
detachment
under
captain
beresford
having
cleared
up
its
camp
marched
out
a
day
after
the
corps
headquarters
had
gone
and
bivouacked
that
night
ten
or
twelve
miles
east
of
pretoria
near
the
pass
known
as
donker
hoek
colonel
lumsden
having
remained
behind
to
see
them
off
went
on
a
stage
or
two
by
train
hoping
that
they
would
overtake
the
leading
company
before
it
joined
general
french
the
two
detachments
were
in
fact
though
they
did
not
know
it
within
cannon
sound
of
each
other
on
september
when
mahon
had
turned
back
from
belfast
to
help
the
canadians
at
pan
station
but
after
that
every
march
took
them
further
apart
the
colonel
pushing
on
with
what
remained
to
him
of
a
company
as
part
of
brigade
while
captain
hundred
could
make
but
slow
progress
on
their
spiritless
horses
the
latter
troops
on
arrival
at
belfast
were
inspected
by
lord
roberts
who
rode
through
their
lines
but
made
no
speech
to
them
general
hutton
who
was
with
the
headquarters
staff
cast
longing
eyes
on
horse
looked
them
over
and
told
captain
clifford
that
he
meant
to
take
them
on
with
him
against
such
wholesale
appropriation
however
captain
beresford
protested
saying
that
the
men
wanted
to
join
their
own
corps
and
the
horses
were
not
fit
yet
after
appeal
to
lord
roberts
captain
beresford
got
his
way
while
at
belfast
the
detachment
had
unpleasant
experience
of
winter
temperature
at
an
altitude
of
more
than
feet
above
sea
level
they
tried
to
supply
artificial
fuel
to
the
system
by
additional
rations
but
were
not
very
successful
as
the
resources
of
belfast
at
that
time
were
low
indeed
and
certain
restrictions
had
to
be
placed
on
traffic
with
the
dutch
inhabitants
one
of
whom
sold
bread
from
the
eating
of
which
twelve
or
fourteen
men
of
an
infantry
regiment
had
been
poisoned
so
sentries
were
posted
to
warn
all
soldiers
against
buying
provisions
to
keep
out
the
icy
wind
some
men
built
themselves
little
huts
of
corrugated
iron
in
the
construction
of
which
we
learn
that
kingchurch
and
cobb
and
the
brothers
allardice
distinguished
themselves
among
one
section
of
b
company
captain
beresford
came
to
have
a
look
at
them
and
in
notes
of
that
time
is
the
appreciative
entry
is
a
very
pleasant
man
and
always
polite
to
every
one
of
us
he
said
our
tin
house
was
much
better
than
the
tents
he
told
us
also
that
lord
roberts
had
expressed
himself
very
much
pleased
with
the
appearance
of
the
men
and
at
belfast
also
horse
were
visited
by
their
former
comrade
a
corporal
in
the
corps
looked
very
smart
as
an
army
their
last
day
at
belfast
was
devoted
to
the
mild
excitement
of
watching
races
in
one
of
which
captain
clifford
came
in
about
sixth
on
mate
and
a
note
is
made
of
the
fact
that
the
duke
of
westminster
who
won
the
steeplechase
like
a
on
the
whole
this
brief
stay
at
belfast
was
more
pleasant
than
first
impressions
of
it
promised
except
for
nightly
excursions
after
loose
argentines
one
of
which
drew
his
picket
peg
so
persistently
and
got
away
on
the
open
veldt
so
often
that
robertson
dubbed
him
ulysses
because
he
was
such
a
wanderer
the
next
day
november
captain
detachment
struck
its
camp
on
that
breezy
high
veldt
and
marched
across
the
battlefield
of
bergendal
on
its
way
to
dalmanutha
and
machadodorp
as
advance
guard
of
general
brigade
no
sooner
had
it
got
into
camp
once
more
than
b
company
was
selected
to
furnish
an
escort
the
next
morning
for
lord
kitchener
the
officer
who
was
to
be
in
command
had
no
other
uniform
than
the
and
suit
that
had
done
service
throughout
most
of
the
campaign
luckily
however
one
of
the
hussars
offered
to
sell
sundry
things
he
was
a
reservist
and
knew
his
way
about
a
military
camp
from
him
a
complete
outfit
was
obtained
and
the
purchaser
then
discovered
much
to
his
amusement
that
he
had
been
dealing
with
one
who
was
a
pushing
commercial
traveller
in
private
life
so
the
officer
was
able
to
turn
out
a
credit
to
the
escort
but
some
mistake
had
been
made
about
the
rendezvous
which
however
the
escort
found
at
last
by
the
lucky
accident
of
meeting
major
watson
lord
by
that
time
the
general
had
gone
on
had
to
follow
at
a
tremendous
pace
galloped
up
every
steep
hill
and
down
the
other
side
over
terrible
ground
a
mass
of
stones
and
such
clouds
of
dust
that
you
could
not
see
the
ground
or
whither
you
were
going
then
caught
up
lord
kitchener
who
was
riding
with
general
hamilton
towards
a
big
camp
on
the
top
of
a
hill
where
they
told
us
general
was
in
command
very
soon
started
back
again
this
time
lord
kitchener
by
himself
and
a
nice
pace
he
led
us
up
hill
and
down
in
clouds
of
dust
got
back
before
having
started
at
and
covered
twelve
miles
during
a
month
at
machadodorp
outpost
duty
and
patrols
towards
lydenburg
or
helvetia
where
boers
were
often
seen
but
never
showed
fight
except
by
sniping
at
long
range
formed
the
ordinary
routine
this
however
was
varied
by
football
matches
for
which

unfortunately
robertson
injured
his

in
one
of
these
matches
and
had
to
go
into
hospital
it
was
at
machadodorp
that
sergeant
stephens
of
the
indian
commissariat
who
was
attached
to
the
transport
staff
of
horse
distinguished
himself
by
several
solitary
expeditions
into
the
unexplored
country
round
about
from
one
of
these
he
came
back
with
a
carriage
which
he
had
found
at
a
farm
and
several
orphans
as
he
described
pigs
whose
owners
had
deserted
them
once
however
he
got

narrated
in

of
reminiscences
illustration
sergeant
stephens
we
had
an
indian
transport
sergeant
lent
to
us
and
a
very
good
useful
man
he
was
but
he
always
had
a
desire
to
kill
a
boer
with
his
own
hand
and
to
be
able
to
swear
to
it
one
day
when
he
was
out
getting
supplies
he
saw
an
armed
boer
riding
over
an
adjacent
ridge
so
he
left
his
carts
and
cantered
away
to
cut
him
off
on
nearing
the
ridge
he
slipped
off
his
horse
and
proceeded
on
foot
topping
the
ridge
he
saw
the
boer
coming
towards
him
and
had
him
dead
practically
suddenly
something
touched
him
looking
up
he
saw
three
rifle
muzzles
and
he
was
a
prisoner
with
a
party
of
boers
they
took
his
rifle
and
horse
and
told
him
to
come
along
with
them
he
walked
between
them
for
a
bit
and
being
a
very
amusing
irishman
proceeded
to
explain
that
in
his
opinion
it
entertaining
him
like
a
guest
to
make
him
tramp
while
they
rode
they
treated
the
subject
at
first
as
a
joke
but
he
was
so
persistent
that
they
at
last
grew
angry
and
threatened
to
shoot
him
if
he
be
quiet
on
this
point
also
he
was
found
to
be
so
argumentative
that
at
last
in
despair
they
told
him
to
make
himself
scarce
which
he
did
with
alacrity
arriving
in
camp
by
evening
none
the
worse
for
his
adventure
and
quite
pleased
as
he
had
only
suffered
to
the
extent
of
a
walk
a
government
rifle
and
a
comparatively
useless
pony

had
come
again
and
with
the
return
of
a
company
from
barberton
to
machadodorp
captain
command
ceased
to
have
an
independent
existence
it
was
on
october
that
major
force
marched
into
camp
without
horses
and
on
the
following
day
colonel
lumsden
passed
through
machadodorp
in
the
princess
hospital
train
bound
for
pretoria
having
received
a
sufficient
number
of
remounts
from
among
horses
that
had
been
left
behind
by
the
imperial
light
horse
and
hussars
the
corps
was
ready
to
take
its
place
in
general
brigade
for
the
sweeping
movement
by
which
it
was
hoped
that
general
french
would
clear
the
country
between
de
kaap
mountains
and
pretoria
nobody
at
the
time
thought
that
it
would
be
rather
more
like
a
rearguard
action
continued
from
day
to
day
than
a
triumphal
progress
we
know
that
from
morning
to
night
the
boers
followed
every
movement
of
columns
potting
at
them
almost
incessantly
no
matter
at
what
hour
the
british
troops
began
their
march
or
halted
in
bivouac
or
how
often
they
changed
direction
the
enemy
was
always
with
them
and
always
close
enough
to
see
though
not
often
seen
a
more
harassing
march
has
probably
never
been
endured
by
any
force
of
similar
strength
in
that
country
all
these
things
we
know
but
men
kept
for
the
privacy
of
their
own
diaries
a
record
of
the
physical
sufferings
that
came
to
them
through
hunger
and
thirst
where
food
if
not
scarce
could
seldom
be
cooked
because
of
the
thunderstorms
night
after
night
and
the
absence
of
firewood
notwithstanding
all
these
discomforts
we
find
a
cheery
strain
running
through
the
unprinted
records
of
horse
and
quite
a
joyful
note
when
by
chance
the
means
of
making
a
fire
falls
in
their
way
then
somebody
is
sure
to
be
provided
with
meat
to
cook
and
we
are
told
how
kingchurch
unexpectedly
produced
done
to
a
turn
or
stew
a
triumph
or
how
indefatigable
hugh
cooked
chops
while
it
still
rained
and
after
dark
he
cooked
mutton
for
the
chronicler
in
his
gratitude
says
men
deserve
to
be
remembered
and
to
have
their
honoured
names
handed
down
to
posterity
and
so
they
find
a
place
in
this
history
one
night
when
rain
was
being
driven
in
sheets
by
a
howling
wind
across
the
bare
hillside
some
of
horse
could
find
no
better
shelter
than
an
round
the
lee
side
of
which
they
grouped
themselves
huddling
together
for
warmth
kingchurch
finding
them
there
said
in
his
whimsical
way
that
they
had
selected
the
epithetally
uncomfortable
in
all
south
it
is
almost
impossible
to
follow
consecutively
the
movements
of

which
consisted
of

used
by
him
with
great
effect
when
by
marching
out
of
bethel
he
induced
the
boers
to
come
in
and
then
pounced
on
them
this
however
is
general
history
the
operations
in
which
horse
took
part
are
described
by
several
correspondents
in
the
following
narrative
at
the
beginning
the
original
idea
was
to
move
on
a
wide
front
through
carolina
ermelo
bethel
to
heidelberg
and
in
consequence
we
started
in
the
afternoon
of
october
with
brigade
in
the
centre
its
main
duty
being
to
escort
and
protect
the
reserve
convoys
of
all
three
columns
mahon
being
eight
to
nine
miles
off
on
our
right
and
gordon
a
similar
distance
on
our
left
these
two
columns
taking
with
them
only
necessary
supplies
for
a
few
days
the
very
first
day
mahon
got
a
severe
check
losing
some
five
officers
and
fifty
men
while
the
next
day
gordon
on
the
left
was
in
turn
hotly
engaged
after
this
general
french
deemed
it
politic
to
bring
in
the
flank
columns
closer
and
thenceforth
we
proceeded
with
only
half
our
former
front
thus
rendering
mutual
assistance
more
easy
although
the
division
consisted
of
three
brigades
so
called
was
only
about
strong
and
amounting
in
all
to
only
three
regiments
on
full
strength
our
task
was
an
extremely
arduous
and
difficult
one
for
the
first
few
marches
were
through
hilly
country
and
the
convoy
advancing
in
a
single
string
covered
seven
miles
to
protect
it
from
surprise
we
had
but
mounted
troops
the
infantry
being
kept
more
or
less
concentrated
near
the
waggons
you
can
imagine
therefore
that
our
sphere
of
operations
was
a
very
extended
one
much
being
evidently
left
to
the
initiative
of
individuals
as
personal
control
by
officers
was
impossible
this
was
the
kind
of
fighting
that
brought
into
prominence
the
good
points
of
irregular
troops
of
which
every
man
is
used
to
act
on
his
own
responsibility
as
occasion
demands
wherein
he
differs
from
the
trained
soldier
who
is
educated
to
act
on
orders
only
the
nature
of
the
convoy
added
greatly
to
the
fatigue
men
had
to
endure
oxen
formed
part
of
the
convoy
and
as
they
are
unable
apparently
at
this
season
of
the
year
to
march
except
in
the
cool
of
the
morning
and
evening
the
working
day
comprised
hours
the
usual
marching
hour
for
was
necessitating
at
often
in
the
rain
the
following
an
hour
later
the
convoy
commenced
packing
at
and
a
halt
was
observed
till
or
in
the
afternoon
in
the
afternoon
led
off
the
following
by
this
arrangement
the
avoided
all
heat
but
never
got
into
camp
till
or
thereabouts
mounted
troops
had
far
the
worst
of
this
for
while
the
infantry
could
put
in
a
long
sleep
and
have
a
good
meal
the
mounted
troops
broken
up
into
small
parties
were
posted
on
hills
all
round
and
the
need
to
keep
a
sharp
left
them
few
opportunities
for
sleeping
or
getting
meals
this
bit
of
country
was
particularly
hard
on
the
men
as
it
was
with
the
greatest
difficulty
that
one
could
obtain
firewood
and
water
by
day
and
as
we
often
arrived
in
camp
long
after
dark
it
was
still
more
difficult
to
get
an
evening
camp
fire
to
add
to
the
trials
half
of
the
available
men
were
on
picket
over
night
and
during
the
day
we
were
surprised
incessantly
our
picket
duties
brought
us
into
constant
little
engagements
in
which
the
corps
had
the
opportunity
of
acting
on
its
own
and
being
ably
handled
by
major
chamney

general
brigade
or
rather
huge
convoy
to
which
we
were
attached
as
the
only
mounted
troops
began
its
march
for
carolina
the
method
was
to
make
an
early
start
halt
at
or
for
three
or
four
hours
and
then
make
easy
progress
on
to
camp
for
the
day
the
veldt
was
changing
into
its
spring
coat
of
green
so
that
the
cattle
could
graze
during
halts
in
consequence
their
condition
was
not
so
bad
on
the
morning
of
the
the
camp
was
aroused
by
the
sound
of
big
guns
booming
to
our
right
front
and
though
the
brigade
was
booked
to
start
at
it
was
not
till
that
the
convoy
got
on
the
way
later
in
the
day
the
news
was
heliographed
that
the
boers
had
made
a
determined
attack
on
general

driven
in
the
outposts

had
only
been
beaten
back
after
severe

being
as
high
as
fifty
on
the
the
music
of
big
guns
was
again
heard
at
dawn
but
to
our
left
front
and
the
news
came
through
that
the
boers
had
attacked
gordon
but
this
time
received
a
reception
they
were
totally
unprepared
for
while
dickson
with
the
convoy
had
camped
by
outside
carolina
as
carolina
had
been
in
boer
occupation
since
the
time
general
mahon
touched
there
on
his
way

barberton
every
precaution
was
taken
against
any
surprise
rumour
said
the
boers
had
sworn
to
trap
french
or
take
the
convoy
and
therefore
our
escort
was
augmented
by
the
dragoon
guards

and

our
experience
for
the
second
time
of
carolina
was
a
bitter
one
not
only
was
the
weather
intensely
cold
but
the
whole
regiment
was
sent
out
on
outlying
picket
for
hours

have
engraved

that

almost
covered
with
letters
and
dates
though
the
names
so
familiar
to
all
of
the
leaders
of
the
boer
cause
are
conspicuously
absent
on
the
we
formed
the
rearguard
and
were
engaged
in
destroying
a
farm
when
a
party
of
about
boers
reconnoitred
our
vicinity
we
looked
at
one
another
and
they
evidently
decided
against
a
fight
for
mahon
had
that
morning
beaten
this
same
lot
rather
badly
they
retired
on
carolina
and
we
proceeded
onward
to
camp
from
this
point
our
further
progress
was
slow
as
the
boers
hugged
the
flanks
and
persistently
attacked
the
rearguard
it
was
a
new
light
to
view
the
enemy
in
and
it
came
somewhat
as
a
surprise
hitherto
the
boer
had
adopted
the
running
game
it
was
very
gratifying
to
hear
that
the
enemy
possessed
neither
guns
nor
ammunition
on
the
a
company
were
doing
advance
guard
supported
by
b
company
when
they
suddenly
encountered
the
fire
of
thirty
boers
strongly
entrenched
at
range
they
fell
back
and
no
section
b
company
advanced
and
opening
volley
fire
under
captain
orders
soon
cleared
the
front
while
o
battery
sent
shell
after
shell
into
the
fleeing
horsemen
captain
known
in
brigade
major
was
good
enough
to
speak
favourably
of
us
it
was
the
first
we
had
had
under
his
leadership
during
the
cannonade
a
funny
incident
occurred
a
rifle
and
bandolier
were
found
in
a
farm
where
only
women
were
to
be
seen
as
this
meant
burning
the
farm
and
seizing
all
stock
the
wife
riding
on
a
saddle
sought
out
the
general
who
chivalrously
acceded
to
her
request
and
the
burning
was
countermanded
the
next
day
passed
quietly
as
far
as
we
were
concerned
though
guns
could
be
heard
in
rear
from
time
to
time
hitherto
the
enemy
had
employed
guns
but
the
welcome
intelligence
was
passed
along
that
they
were
completely
out
of
gun
ammunition
the
camp
was
pitched
at
bethel
a
town
containing
only
some
six
families
three
of
them
english
on
the
morning
the
regiment
paraded
for
inspection
by
general
french
who
took
advantage
of
the
halt
at
bethel
to
say
a
few
words
of
encouragement
to
each
regiment
addressing
horse
he
said
the
reputation
of
the
corps
stood
very
high
their
behaviour
and
gallantry
were
spoken
of
by
everyone
and
though
he
had
no
personal
knowledge
of
the
corps
he
had
heard
of
their
splendid
work
and
the
good
service
they
had
done
there
was
no
doubt
that
everyone
of
all
ranks
was
anxious
for
a
rest
which
was
well
deserved
there
was
no
saying
however
what
might
happen
but
he
hoped
the
onward
march
to
heidelberg
would
be
an
easy
one
and
he
trusted
to
horse
maintaining
to
the
end
that
reputation
for
gallantry
they
had
worthily
at
the
conclusion
of
the
address
major
chamney
called
for
three
cheers
for
general
french
as
the
boers
were
hovering
all
round
us
the
entire
regiment
spent
the
night
on
outlying
picket
and
it
was
a
night
cold
and
miserable
at
on
the
the
brigade
stood
to
arms
and
by
bethel
had
been
left
behind
the
boers
were
most
persistent
and
tenaciously
hung
round
us
losing
no
opportunity
of
sniping
about
we
were
caught
in
a
terrific
hailstorm
the
hail
lying
an
inch
thick
upon
the
veldt
when
it
ceased
leaving
us
shivering
and
drenched
though
cheerful
enough
as
we
resumed
our
onward
course
at
the
gallop
to
restore
circulation
in
men
and
horses
before
camping
we
did
some
distant
shooting
at
the
enemy
but
gave
it
up
as
too
long
a
range
the
water
at
this
camp
was
inky
black
but
in
the
absence
of
better
had
to
be
used
for
tea
and
coffee
though
many
decided
to
defer
a
wash
till
next
day
the
whole
regiment
were
again
put
on
duty
as
pickets
and
in
their
exposed
positions
had
a
bitter
experience
of
a
typical
south
african
hailstorm
during
that
afternoon
the
next
day
the
whistle
sounded
at
and
the
different
brigades
were
on
the
move
by
the
enemy
kept
up
sniping
systematically
on
the
flanks
while
the
guns
in
rear
were
in
action
some
times
during
the
day
during
the
afternoon
a
terrific
hailstorm
burst
over
us
saturating
our
garments
and
making
everybody
very
miserable
the
hail
lay
inches
deep
on
the
veldt
prisoners
were
taken
daily
and
a
few
refugee
women
were
under
our
protection
a
singular
incident
occurred
on
this
day
one
of
the
prisoners
who
had
surrendered
handed
in
a
rifle
belonging
to
horse
which
has
since
been
identified
as
belonging
to
corporal
macgillivray
of
a
company
who
had
been
taken
prisoner
at
ospruit

attack
on
the
left
and
no

acting
as
support
was
engaged
the
carabiniers
had
retired
some
ten
minutes
when
the
left
flankers
rose
from
cover
and
moved
towards
their
led
horses
as
they
mounted
the
boers
reached
a
ridge
commanding
our
position
and
within
range
they
peppered
us
very
smartly
as
we
galloped
out
of
range
without
a
single
casualty

nobody

as

came
for

behind

there
was

in

decision
as
it
exposed
those

to
the
risk
of
getting

who
had
made
up
their

refused
to
come
in
and
remained
on
the
observation

shortly
after
another
messenger
was
sent
with
threats
of
instant
arrest
if

were
not
obeyed
just
as

arrived

was
seen
through
a
glass
leading
the

about
two
miles
away
to
the
left
rear
and
close
to
the
flanks
of
the
former
position
from
which
the

had
been
firing

was
making

to
gallop
down
and

show

the
way

did

in

worth

was
informed
who
we

that
he

it

good
shot

gives
a
slightly
different
version
of
the
incident
we
were
acting
as

when

took
fright
and
ran
away
while
his

went
after
it
and
followed
it
for
two
miles
at
right
angles
to
our
line
of
advance
we
saw
him
catch
the
horse
and
begin
leading
it
back
and
then
saw
him
no
more
though
we
waited
half
an
hour
as
messages
were
coming
from
the
rearguard
commander
to
us
to
follow
more
quickly
we
had
to
leave
all
fully
convinced
that
our
poor
parks
had
been
ambushed
illustration
corporal

after
a
mile
or
so
our
widely
extended
line
came
down
a
long
fairly
steep
incline
on
the
top
of
the
opposite
slope
of
which
we
saw
our
battery
o
in
position
as
we
neared
the
bottom
of
the
intervening
valley
the
battery
opened
fire
with
one
round
which
burst
on
the
top
of
the
slope
we
had
just
left
and
looking
round
we
saw
a
party
of
six
men
riding
down
at
a
gallop
waving
a
handkerchief
they
turned
out
to
be
some
of
our
own
men
who
having
at
the
last
moment
seen

coming
in
waited
for
him
the

had
seen
the
heads
of
mounted
men
in
slouch
hats
advance
quickly
and
mistaking
them
for

a

roses
abounded
in

attached
to
the
picturesque

and
altogether
a
feeling
of
peace
and
security
seemed
to
prevail
our
stay
was
a
limited
one
and
on
the
morning
the
trek
was
resumed
through
nigel
to
springs
the
country
we
had
to
traverse
is
rich
in
mineral
wealth
gold
and
coal
mines
being
already
in
existence
while
hundreds
of
claims
are
pegged
out
against
the
of
peace
and
the
advance
of
the
capitalist
at
springs
on
the
return
journey
to
pretoria
we
were
saluted
by
colt
guns
which
were
repeatedly
fired
at
us
as
we
approached
the
trenches
manned
by
british
troops
our
men
were
naturally
very
irate
and
wanted
very
much
to
fire
back
they
considered
it
particularly
hard
lines
since
we
had
been
marching
in
the
open
and
heliographing
from
a
distance
of
ten
miles
the
was
a
great
day
as
a
parade
before
his
excellency
lord
roberts
was
fixed
for
the
was
punctual
to
time
and
during
the
inspection
addressed
himself
to
the
several
companies
as
he
met
them
the
various
regiments
then
went
past
in
order
of
brigades
and
returned
to
camp
major
chamney
before
dismissing
horse
paraphrased
what
lord
roberts
had
said
to
him
for
the
benefit
of
the
regiment
briefly
it
was
to
the
effect
that
the
disbandment
of
the
corps
was
at
the
present
time
impossible
but
lord
roberts
had
telegraphed
to
his
excellency
the
viceroy
asking
him
to
use
his
influence
in
keeping
appointments
open
as
far
as
possible
horse
had
requested
disbandment
on
the
reasonable
grounds
of
pressing
business
in
india
and
the
fact
of
local
colonial
and
other
volunteer
the
horse
and
been
disintegrated
at
first
an
abrupt
refusal
was
given
but
yesterday
general
french
telegraphed
to
lord
kitchener
and
strongly
recommended
our
case
a
reply
has
been
received
that
only
those
having
business
of
an
urgent
nature
in
india
may
return
but
they
must
pay
their
own
expenses
back
only
a
railway
ticket
to
port
of
embarkation
being
provided
needless
to
say
many
are
going
even
on
these
conditions
but
those
who
desire
to
go
to
england
have
to
hang
on
for
an
indefinite
period
of
time
still
only
from
machadodorp
three
surma
valley
men
were
allowed
to
leave
as
their
appointments
were
in
jeopardy
these
men
had
free
passages
back
given
them
again
a
fortunate
few
have
been
given
employment
in
south
africa
and
they
were
permitted
to
leave
as
their
appointments
were
secured
these
number
altogether
about
twenty
colonel
lumsden
is
unfortunately
still
away
from
the
regiment
sick
at
pretoria
major
chamney
officiating
in
command
finds
his
hands
tied
to
some
extent
and
can
not
do
much
for
us
in
matters
of
such
moment
but
the
feeling
in
the
regiment
is
very
strong
and
the
term
is
sneered
at
as
a
misnomer
if
the
war
was
not
over
it
would
be
quite
another
matter
but
it
has
been
announced
that
the
war
is
practically
ended
and
the
duties
now
to
be
performed
are
in
the
nature
of
police
work
all
round
springs
was
a
hotbed
of
boers
and
patrols
proceeding
two
or
three
miles
from
camp
were
invariably
sniped
at
just
outside
springs
we
had
great
luck
in
finding
a
brewery
which
despite
the
war
had
not
ceased
to
brew
and
we
regaled
ourselves
with
limited
quantities
of
colonial
stout
in
a
vain
endeavour
to
keep
out
the
eternal
rain
the
boers
who
were
used
to
dealing
with
a
garrison
armed
with
carbines
were
rather
surprised
one
day
when
going
to
round
up
some
cattle
they
ran
into
a
small
patrol
of
our
corps
and
trooper
consterdine
fetched
one
of
them
out
of
the
saddle
with
a
good
shot
at
yards
and
thus
gave
them
a
lesson
which
will
probably
make
them
more
careful
the
weather
now
became
absolutely
vile
there
were
hailstorms
every
afternoon
just
late
enough
to
spoil
any
chance
of
getting
dry
for
the
night
the
roads
were
very
heavy
and
horses
could
not
get
on
we
hoped
and
concluded
the
boers
were
in
the
same
fix
from
springs
the
boers
ceased
to
give
trouble
but
this
was
more
than
atoned
for
by
the
abominable
weather
and
going
for
hours
it
poured
torrents
without
ceasing
and
there
was
not
a
dry
skin
or
blanket
in
the
division
to
remove
misapprehension
it
is
necessary
to
say
men
had
seen
no
tents
for
practically
eight
months
bad
it
was
for
us
and
the
horses
but
worse
for
the
transport
the
animals
dying
daily
to
such
an
extent
that
it
was
all
they
could
do
to
drag
empty
waggons
into
pretoria
every
morning
latterly
had
announced
the
death
of
animals
that
had
dragged
our
carts
for
many
miles
and
to
save
the
waggons
from
falling
into
the
hands
of
the
boers
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
burn
them
it
was
no
uncommon
sight
to
see
cattle
lying
in
the
last
stages
of
exhaustion
on
the
road
and
ere
death
ensued
being
cut
up
and
looked
upon
as
a
great
treat
by
the
local
kaffirs
everybody
was
struck
by
the
formation
of
our
transport
when
out
of
hilly
country
the
waggons
moved
along
in
a
dense
mass
with
a
frontage
of
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
and
depth
of
half
a
mile
the
whole
mass
forcing
its
way
over
nullahs
and
obstacles
irresistibly
it
will
be
obvious
to
all
that
this
formation
of
the
convoy
lent
itself
much
more
easily
to
protection
than
a
stream
of
waggons
seven
miles
long
at
of
november
the
trek
was
resumed
the
direction
being
pretoria
a
heavy
drizzle
of
rain
was
falling
and
without
intermission
it
continued
for
three
days
only
ceasing
when
pretoria
was
seen
in
the
distance
on
the
morning
of
the
every
garment
whether
on
the
person
or
in
the
kit
bags
was
wet
and
never
was
sunshine
more
welcome
than
on
that
morning
by
the
regiment
had
camped
on
the
far
side
of
the
racecourse
and
for
the
first
time
since
april
experienced
the
shelter
of
tents
chapter
xviii
from
lord
to
south
though
they
did
not
know
it
at
the
time
horse
as
a
corps
had
done
their
last
march
in
the
transvaal
and
fired
their
last
shot
against
the
boers
they
had
begun
to
think
that
others
with
less
chance
of
serving
the
empire
elsewhere
and
fewer
interests
calling
them
home
could
very
well
do
all
the
work
that
remained
to
be
done
in
south
africa
yet
up
to
that
time
their
expressions
of
a
wish
to
be
relieved
as
other
volunteer
contingents
had
been
from
the
fruitless
pursuit
of
guerilla
raiders
was
productive
of
no
result
it
is
hardly
surprising
therefore
after
the
miserable
experiences
of
a
sweeping
movement
by
which
nothing
of
any
importance
had
been
achieved
and
from
which
nobody
suffered
much
except
the
troops
engaged
in
it
that
a
spirit
of
discontent
should
have
begun
to
manifest
itself
among
men
who
knew
that
every
day
they
remained
in
south
africa
might
jeopardise
all
their
future
careers
they
were
running
the
risk
of
losing
all
and
gaining
no
commensurate
advantage
either
for
themselves
or
for
the
empire
it
is
little
to
be
wondered
at
therefore
that
they
should
have
envied
the
city
imperial
volunteers
the
canadians
and
some
other
colonial
contingents
which
had
been
allowed
to
leave
for
home
when
lord
roberts
declared
that
regular
warfare
was
at
an
end
even
the
departure
of
some
of
their
own
comrades
whose
plea
of
urgent
private
affairs
had
prevailed
over
military
considerations
seemed
to
some
extent
a
grievance
so
that
when
thesiger
and
were
allowed
to
go
many
others
regretted
that
they
also
had
not
applied
for
passages
to
india
instead
of
england
so
far
back
as
october
army
orders
had
contained
the
following
colonial
contingents
it
has
been
brought
to
the
notice
of
the
that
many
men
of
the
colonial
contingents
made
arrangements
before
leaving
their
homes
for
only
one
year
which
has
now
nearly
expired
though
precise
date
can
not
yet
be
fixed
on
which
all
will
be
free
commanding
officers
may
submit
names
of
any
urgent
cases
at
once
and
the
hopes
that
within
the
next
few
weeks
he
may
be
able
to
dispense
with
their
services
which
have
proved
invaluable
to
the
empire
but
lord
roberts
with
every
wish
to
meet
the
convenience
of
those
who
had
sacrificed
much
for
the
sake
of
serving
under
him
found
himself
hampered
by
unforeseen
circumstances
which
were
fully
explained
in
one
of
his
despatches
about
this
date
still
remained
much
for
the
army
in
south
africa
to
do
before
the
country
could
be
said
to
be
completely
conquered
certain
boer
leaders
notably
de
wet
and
de
la
rey
had
still
to
be
dealt
with
and
the
guerilla
warfare
carried
on
by
them
put
a
stop
this
state
of
affairs
made
it
imperative
that
the
army
should
be
broken
up
into
several
comparatively
small
columns
of
increased
mobility
mounted
troops
were
therefore
in
more
demand
than
ever
great
difficulty
was
experienced
in
carrying
out
these
necessary
changes
owing
to
the
time
having
arrived
for
the
withdrawal
of
the
royal
canadian
dragoons
the
royal
canadian
regiment
the
three
batteries
of
canadian
artillery
and
the
greater
part
of
the
first
contingents
furnished
by
australia
new
zealand
and
tasmania
and
allowing
the
members
of
the
second
south
african
corps
to
return
to
their
homes
and
employments
after
having
been
embodied
for
twelve
months
it
was
impossible
to
disregard
the
urgent
reasons
given
by
our
colonial
comrades
for
not
being
able
to
remain
longer
at
the
seat
of
war
they
had
done
admirable
service
and
shown
themselves
well
fitted
to
take
their
places
by
the
side
of
her
regular
troops
and
i
witnessed
their
departure
with
deep
regret
not
only
on
account
of
their
many
soldierly
qualities
but
because
it
materially
impaired
the
mobility
and
efficiency
of
the
army
in
south
africa
for
the
time
being
a
very
critical
time
too
until
indeed
a
fresh
body
of
mounted
infantry
could
be
formed
from
the
nearest
available
line
battalions
and
the
several
south
african
local
corps
could
be
again
recruited
up
to
their
original
strength

thus
the
having
declared
that
regular
warfare
was
at
an
end
found
himself
unable
to
deal
effectually
with
raiding
guerilla
bands
for
want
of
enough
mobile
troops
in
this
difficulty
he
kept
faith
with
those
who
had
completed
the
year
of
service
for
which
they
had
enlisted
by
letting
them
go
horse
did
not
come
within
that
category
and
though
lord
roberts
recognised
the
justice
of
their
plea
on
behalf
of
men
who
were
sacrificing
much
he
would
promise
nothing
until
fresh
companies
of
mounted
infantry
could
be
formed
to
fill
the
places
left
vacant
by
canadians
new
zealanders
and
australians
who
had
gone
colonel
ceaseless
efforts
however
had
so
impressed
the
that
he
sent
a
cable
message
to
the
viceroy
urging
him
as
honorary
colonel
of
horse
to
use
all
his
influence
with
employers
on
behalf
of
members
of
the
corps
so
that
their
appointments
in
india
might
be
kept
open
for
them
a
little
longer
lord
roberts
added
trust
the
war
is
nearly
over
but
it
is
essential
that
all
shall
hold
together
till
the
end
and
it
would
be
a
hardship
to
members
of
a
corps
that
has
done
such
gallant
service
if
they
were
to
suffer
for
their
devotion
to
the
cause
of
the
several
men
whose
cases
were
exceptionally
urgent
got
permission
to
leave
for
india
and
others
who
had
accepted
commissions
in
regular
regiments
or
civil
appointments
were
necessarily
taken
off
the
strength
of
the
corps
which
consequently
became
reduced
to
little
more
than
a
full
company
one
of
the
staff
therefore
thought
it
an
opportune
time
to
trace
the
whereabouts
of
men
who
had
ceased
to
serve
in
the
ranks
of
horse
he
therefore
prepared
a
record
in
tabulated
form
which
was
at
that
time
the
most
complete
return
available
though
he
prefaced
it
with
an
apology
for
incompleteness
the
corps
has
shifted
about
such
a
lot
recently
that
it
is
difficult
to
know
accurately
what
has
happened
to
many
men
who
were
left
sick
at
various
points

the

it

to
so
many

some

will
prevent
him
from
joining
his
new
regiment
for
a
long
time
meanwhile
it
appears
that
colonel
lumsden
had
been
trying
to
secure
for
calcutta
one
of
the
guns
so
gallantly
captured
by
his
men
he
received
the
following
letter
army
headquarters
johannesburg
november
dear
colonel
lumsden
reference
to
your
request
to
be
permitted
to
take
back
to
calcutta
one
of
the
guns
captured
from
the
enemy
the
desires
me
to
inform
you
that
he
fears
you
must
wait
until
he
knows
definitely
what
guns
he
has
to
dispose
of
believe
me
yours
sincerely
cowan
military
secretary
that
the
corps
were
not
so
homesick
as
to
have
lost
their
zest
for
sport
or
for
the
simple
pleasures
that
came
in
their
way
may
be
gathered
from
the
following
note
furnished
by
their
late
adjutant
on
the
conclusion
of
the
march
from
machadodorp
we
were
left
to
for
ten
days
at
pretoria
and
were
one
day
asked
to
produce
an
polo
team
we
had
some
seven
officers
to
choose
from
and
a
few
chargers
which
were
small
enough
for
the
game
no
sticks
and
only
parade
saddles
and
we
had
never
played
together
however
we
produced
a
team
and
went
to
the
fray
we
found
it
was
quite
a
big
affair
there
was
a
crowd
of
spectators
with
a
fair
ground
umpires
whistles
and
we
agreed
to
play
rules
which
none
of
us
knew
they
kindly
lent
us
of
sorts
and
the
game
began
it
was
a
really
good
game
and
the
chargers
rendered
docile
by
work
and
starvation
played
wonderfully
however
we
were
beaten
by
two
goals
to
one
and
in
the
return
match
we
each
got
one
goal
we
were
quite
proud
of
the
show
as
our
opponents
represented
the
whole
garrison
including
one
cavalry
division
and
were
in
some
practice

gazetted
to
the
regular
army
one
day
about
this
time
the
editor
was
present
at
a
little
scene
which
may
be
interesting
as
an
example
of
the
many
strange
meetings
that
characterised
a
campaign
in
which
men
from
all
parts
of
the
world
came
together
his
son
a
lieutenant
in
the
army
service
corps
had
just
been
transferred
from
an
irregular
cavalry
regiment
and
they
were
celebrating
the
first
occasion
of
being
together
since
the
relief
of
ladysmith
at
another
table
colonel
lumsden
and
some
of
his
officers
were
dining
introductions
followed
when
suddenly
captain
holmes
and
the
young
lieutenant
greeted
each
other
by
familiar
nicknames
which
neither
had
heard
for
some
years
as
students
they
had
served
together
in
the
volunteers
of
which
lord
leighton
was
then
honorary
colonel
they
had
been
fighting
through
the
campaign
one
from
natal
the
other
from
bloemfontein
their
paths
had
crossed
several
times
without
either
knowing
it
and
here
at
the
end
they
met
in
pretoria
for
the
first
time
since
boyhood
such
incidents
occurred
frequently
until
they
ceased
to
be
strange
and
they
illustrate
the
power
of
a
sentiment
that
drew
men
from
every
quarter
of
the
globe
to
south
africa
where
the
interests
centred
all
were
then
beginning
to
think
that
there
might
be
still
a
long
spell
of
campaigning
before
them
and
in
spite
of
a
little
natural
grumbling
they
took
the
prospect
philosophically
enough
as
we
may
see
by
the
following
extract
from
a
letter
at
pretoria
we
were
joined
by
captain
noblett
and
captain
stevenson
who
had
been
away
on
two
sick
leave
visiting
natal
battlefields
and
lieutenant
neville
who
had
left
us
sick
in
june
been
to
england
and
come
back
and
little
expected
to
find
any
of
us
still
there
we
were
overjoyed
to
hear
we
were
to
have
ten
rest
in
tents
the
first
we
had
seen
for
many
months
we
were
now
living
on
the
fat
of
the
land
of
dry
canteen
where
you
could
buy
at
half
price
those
necessaries
of
life
which
had
lately
been
considered
luxuries
the
balance
being
paid
out
of
the
funds
provided
by
our
kind
friends
in
india
here
we
waxed
fat
colonel
lumsden
in
his
absence
from
the
corps
had
not
been
idle
and
had
been
putting
before
the
highest
authorities
the
real
urgency
in
many
cases
to
men
for
whom
prolonged
absence
from
india
would
mean
absolute
ruin
to
such
purpose
did
he
work
that
a
week
after
arrival
we
received
the
welcome
news
that
seventy
of
the
most
urgent
cases
were
permitted
to
go
we
saw
them
off
on
november
under
major
chamney
and
then
returned
to
camp
in
full
anticipation
of
another
year
of
it
a
week
after
this
came
the
joyful
news
that
the
whole
corps
was
also
to
return
at
once
and
on
the
we
entrained
for
cape
town
despite
various
alarms
railway
accidents
and
breaking
up
of
the
line
in
front
of
us
we
arrived
in
cape
town
without
mishap
alas
for
the
horses
only
four
remained
to
come
back
with
the
corps
some
troopers
hoped
to
have
brought
the
regimental
dog
who
was
quite
a
veteran
and
by
distinguished
service
fully
entitled
to
ease
with
a
pension
for
life
trooper
morison
gives
the
following
sketch
of
him
he
first
attached
himself
to
the
regiment
at
irene
in
july
he
very
soon
became
a
popular
character
among
us
and
went
by
the
name
of
kruger
and
from
that
time
on
he
was
always
to
be
found
with
the
regiment
his
intelligence
was
almost
human
and
it
is
a
mystery
how
he
could
always
find
the
regiment
when
marching
with
other
troops
on
more
than
one
occasion
he
has
been
the
means
of
finding
men
in
distant
parts
of
the
field
owing
to
his
white
colour
that
dog
and
trooper
burgess
seemed
to
understand
each
other
perfectly
he
started
from
pretoria
with
the
regiment
for
india
but
unfortunately
got
left
behind
one
morning
at
a
wayside
station
on
november

be
marked

pride

a
pleasure

colonel
lumsden
officers
and

am
very
pleased
indeed
to
have
the
honour
of
saying
a
few
words
to
you
before
you
leave
south
africa
we
are
all
very
grateful
to
you
for
the
noble
services
you
have
rendered
in
the
field
for
us
for
upwards
of
twelve
months
you
are
now
going
home
covered
with
honour
and
glory
and
i
earnestly
trust
you
will
find
all
those
you
left
behind
you
well
and
anxious
to
give
you
a
hearty
welcome
which
i
feel
sure
awaits
you
on
your
return
on
the
outbreak
of
hostilities
in
this
country
colonel
lumsden
at
once
offered
his
services
and
also
to
organise
a
corps
to
proceed
to
south
africa
to
fight
for
queen
and
country
out
of
men
who
eagerly
offered
themselves
in
response
to
the
call
for
volunteers
were
accepted
this
gratifying
response
is
an
eloquent
testimony
to
the
patriotic
spirit
by
which
the
british
race
all
over
the
world
are
animated
to
the
public
of
india
and
to
colonel
lumsden
belong
the
credit
for
the
equipment
of
your
corps
with
everything
needful
excepting
rifle
and
bandolier
and
i
can
only
characterise
the
action
of
your
colonel
as
patriotic
in
the
highest
degree
and
deserving
the
hearty
thanks
of
all
apart
from
the
splendid
services
rendered
in
the
field
i
feel
assured
that
if
lord
roberts
were
now
to
ask
colonel
lumsden
to
again
return
to
the
field
his
request
would
be
most
willingly
and
promptly
complied
with
by
one
and
all
of
the
contingent
here
who
would
be
only
too
eager
to
follow
their
trusted
and
tried
leader
to
further
honour
and
glory
some
of
your
members
have
fallen
in
the
field
fighting
bravely
for
the
dear
old
flag
and
the
honour
and
prestige
of
the
empire
others
more
fortunate
have
secured
civil
and
other
appointments
in
the
country
in
which
they
have
acquitted
themselves
with
so
much
credit
to
the
corps
and
the
country
from
which
they
hail
out
of
the
men
comprised
in
the
corps
as
originally
organised
have
received
commissions
a
most
gratifying
percentage
while
fifteen
men
have
received
civil
appointments
and
thirty
have
joined
the
constabulary
force
commanded
by
general
so
that
on
the
whole
your
corps
have
done
exceedingly
well
as
regards
employment
in
south
africa
it
is
also
very
pleasing
to
learn
that
the
contingent
holds
a
splendid
record
from
lord
roberts
downwards
i
wish
to
impress
upon
you
the
fact
that
after
your
queen
and
the
empire
you
were
fighting
for
the
vital
principles
of
right
and
justice
claimed
by
chamberlain
and
sir
alfred
milner
and
if
kruger
and
steyn
had
been
willing
to
recognise
the
equity
of
such
claim
there
would
have
been
no
necessity
to
have
recourse
to
the
sword
it
is
recognised
that
the
only
man
who
is
capable
of
establishing
permanent
peace
and
settlement
in
south
africa
is
his
excellency
sir
alfred
milner
and
by
urging
this
fact
in
season
and
out
of
season
whenever
the
opportunity
occurs
upon
your
return
to
india
you
will
be
rendering
a
further
service
to
the
country
which
you
have
already
placed
under
a
lasting
debt
of
gratitude
for
services
already
performed
we
are
going
to
send
you
a
little
souvenir
of
your
sojourn
in
south
africa
and
as
a
slight
token
of
our
gratitude
and
appreciation
for
the
great
work
you
have
done
for
us
and
as
the
years
roll
on
and
your
children
and
grandchildren
gather
around
you
probably
you
may
be
asked
by

the

you
to
understand

in
coming
here
we
were
only
actuated
by
our
duty
to
our
queen
and
to
our
country
i
have
again
to
thank
you
for
the
trouble
you

enough

this
afternoon
and
to
assure
you
that
we
greatly
appreciate
your
courtesy

called
upon

the
call
was
enthusiastically
responded

their
farewell

which
any
regiment
might
have

fought
side
by

with
regular
soldiers
of
the
british
army
and
earned
a
character
for
courage
among
men
whose
devotion
they
in
turn
regarded
with
admiration
and
strove
to
emulate
they
had
made
many
friends
among
all
branches
of
the
service
imperial
and
colonial
and
had
won
the
respect
even
of
their
enemies
it
had
been
their
good
fortune
to
serve
under
three
at
least
of
the
ablest
leaders
who
came
to
the
front
in
the
course
of
that
long
campaign
and
from
every
one
of
these
they
won
commendation
as
a
body
of
troopers
on
whom
reliance
might
be
placed
in
any
emergency

irregular
contingent
that
had
been
kept
up
to
date
and
the
men
of
horse
left
south
africa
not
only
in
possession
of
every
shilling
of
pay
then
due
to
them
but
just
as
they
had
left
india
ten
months
earlier
owing
not
a
debt
in
the
country
though
the
country
owed
them
much
in
the
form
of
obligations
that
can
never
be
forgotten
except
by
the
men
who
conscious
of
duty
nobly
done
need
no
other
reward
they
were
leaving
south
africa
assured
by
every
testimony
that
high
approval
could
give
that
they
had
done
their
duty
and
done
it
well
they
had
with
other
soldiers
taken
their
full
share
of
great
hardships
the
weariness
of
long
marches
the
trying
ordeals
of
exposure
to
fierce
heat
by
day
and
bitter
cold
at
night
sometimes
drenched
to
the
skin
when
they
lay
down
to
rest
on
the
bare
veldt
with
no
tent
to
shelter
them
and
not
always
a
blanket
to
cover
them
at
other
times
benumbed
by
the
icy
coldness
of
a
wind
that
stiffened
their
wet
khaki
tunics
with
frost
which
the
sluggish
blood
had
not
warmth
enough
to
these
things
they
had
borne
with
a
manly
fortitude
that
won
the
respect
of
veterans
and
they
were
going
back
with
the
knowledge
that
the
of
such
an
army
as
great
britain
had
never
sent
to
war
before
in
all
the
long
course
of
her
history
had
signified
his
approval
of
their
conduct
in
that
telegram
to
the
viceroy
of
india
expressing
recognition
of
the
excellent
service
rendered
by
officers
officers
and
men
of
whom
he
said
has
been
a
pride
and
a
pleasure
to
me
to
have
under
my
command
a
volunteer
contingent
which
has
so
well
upheld
the
honour
of
the
indian
with
these
words
assuring
them
of
a
great
appreciation
they
were
going
back
to
the
certainty
of
an
enthusiastic
welcome
from
the
people
of
india
to
whose
honour
all
the
good
deeds
of
horse
redound
of
the
warmth
of
that
welcome
his
excellency
the
viceroy
had
given
them
a
foretaste
when
in
his
reply
to
the
message
received
from
lord
roberts
he
sent
back
by
cable
the
inspiriting
words
will
welcome
those
who
are
coming
back
with
enthusiasm
and
wish
to
those
who
it
was
with
knowledge
of
the
deep
interest
taken
by
lord
curzon
in
all
things
concerning
horse
that
the
telegraphed
to
him
something
more
than
a
formal
recognition
of
their
services
it
was
with
characteristic
intuition
and
tact
that
the
viceroy
replied
giving
voice
to
the
wishes
of
a
whole
people
and
expressing
those
wishes
in
the
choicest
of
phrases
in
this
telegram
lord
curzon
epitomised
the
meaning
of
all
that
he
had
said
or
done
for
the
welfare
of
horse
since
the
corps
was
formed
nearly
a
year
earlier
and
his
desire
that
its
services
should
be
recognised
both
officially
and
publicly
as
a
bond
between
india
and
the
mother
event
in
which
all
classes
of
the
empire
might
equally
take
pride
all
this
and
more
his
excellency
continued
to
demonstrate
by
the
share
he
took
in
welcoming
the
warriors
home
when
his
eloquent
words
appealed
alike
to
the
quick
sympathies
and
to
the
intelligence
of
those
who
heard
him
speak
or
read
what
he
had
to
say
and
long
after
the
flood
of
popular
enthusiasm
had
reached
its
height
he
continued
to
manifest
his
interest
in
the
corps
by
practical
efforts
to
benefit
its
surviving
members
and
by
a
most
graceful
tribute
to
the
memory
of
those
whose
lives
had
been
sacrificed
for
the
honour
of
the
empire
at
his
own
cost
lord
curzon
erected
a
tablet
in
cathedral
calcutta
on
which
was
inscribed
the
name
of
every
man
of
the
corps
who
had
died
in
south
africa
and
himself
wrote
the
touching
lines
that
will
through
commemorate
the
services
they
rendered
throughout
lord
great
aim
was
to
foster
and
encourage
the
spirit
of
volunteering
the
importance
of
which
to
a
empire
nobody
realises
more
fully
than
he
as
a
proof
of
his
conviction
in
this
regard
he
has
succeeded
in
getting
an
of
volunteers
appointed
on
the
staff
in

and
the

of
this

directly
it
was
known
through
the
telegram
sent
by
lord

from
irene
that
horse
were
actually
on
their
way
home
a
committee
met
at
the
chamber
of
commerce
and
elected
sir
patrick
playfair
as
its
chairman
this
body
was
thoroughly
representative
of
the
mercantile
community
and
all
the
complex
elements
that
constitute
the
most
influential
sections
of
society
in
calcutta
it
included
judges
barristers
doctors
solicitors
besides
the
most
prominent
native
merchants
and
princes
and
formed
altogether
one
of
the
most
typical
assemblages
ever
known
in
the
city
it
was
called
to
decide
what
sort
of
reception
should
be
given
to
horse
and
its
deliberations
closed
with
the
unanimous
resolve
to
make
the
occasion
worthy
alike
of
a
great
country
and
of
those
who
had
fought
for
its
honour
with
a
courage
and
devotion
characteristic
of
british
soldiers
the
decision
was
telegraphed
to
his
excellency
the
viceroy
who
was
at
that
time
absent
from
calcutta
on
tour
the
committee
were
very
anxious
that
horse
should
arrive
in
time
to
take
part
in
the
new
year
proclamation
parade
commemorating
the
empress
of
accession
when
according
to
custom
there
is
a
great
military
concentration
in
calcutta
of
regular
troops
volunteers
and
all
branches
of
the
imperial
service
to
be
reviewed
by
the
viceroy
in
reply
to
sir
patrick
message
the
following
telegram
was
received
of
a
telegram
from
to
sir
patrick
playfair
dated
bangalore
december
the
viceroy
will
be
very
glad
to
take
part
in
any
reception
that
it
may
be
possible
to
organise
for
horse
on
their
return
to
calcutta
and
would
gladly
entertain
them
to
lunch
or
in
some
other
way
he
consulted
military
department
upon
the
subject
a
fortnight
ago
but
has
received
no
reply
difficulty
seems
to
be
first
that
force
is
coming
back
in
separate
batches
second
that
all
of
these
do
not
come
to
calcutta
one
batch
being
due
at
bombay
december
it
is
for
consideration
whether
it
would
be
possible
to
invite
the
whole
force
to
calcutta
and
give
them
public
reception
but
there
may
be
difficulties
in
this
course
about
this
time
the
executive
committee
received
a
most
gratifying
tribute
to
the
reputation
that
the
contingent
had
made
for
itself
in
south
africa
this
was
an
intimation
that
patriotic
fund
had
voted
under
the
rules
of
the
institution
towards
the
expenses
of
horse
in
acknowledgment
of
their
services
to
the
empire
a
cheque
for
this
generous
amount
had
been
forwarded
to
the
government

the

of

major
neville
taylor
tells
the
story
of
the
voyage
from
cape
town
to
bombay
in
his
own
cheery
way
we
had
no
horses
to
look
after
and
no
drill
no
saddles
or
rifles
but
plenty
of
accommodation
for
the
men
i
think
everyone
enjoyed
the
rest
immensely
proceeding
to
durban
we
picked
up
most
of
the
men
who
had
left
on
urgent
private
affairs
in
the
which
had
been
unexpectedly
stopped
at
durban
after
the
rough
living
of
the
veldt
the
good
feeding
on
board
ship
was
very
welcome
and
rapidly
told
its
tale
in
the
condition
of
the
men
before
leaving
cape
town
the
colonel
had
authorised
the
purchase
of
extra
stores
for
the

out
of
the

funds
two
or
three
evenings
every
week
were
wiled
away
with
and
many
hours
of
each
day
devoted
to
sport
of
some
sort
these
gave
trooper
cowen
the
regimental
artist
many
opportunities
of
adding
character
sketches
to
the
portfolio
that
was
already
well
filled
with
subjects
from
the
war
on
christmas
day
the
men
had
a
really
good
dinner
and
the

were
the
guests

kind
veteran

of
our
ship

very
lively

drew
near

so

very
busy

came
in

gaily
dressed

the
members
of

a
hearty
welcome

while

it
is
to
be
hoped
that
all
the
members
of
your
corps
will
come
across
and
the
viceroy
is
further
desirous
that
members
of
the
corps
who

already
returned
to
india
and
taken
their
discharge
should
be
invited
to
come
to
calcutta
and
take
part
in
the
parade
and
public
demonstration
i
am
therefore
communicating
with
those
members
who
have
already
returned
to
india
so
far
as
i
am
aware
of
their
names
and
addresses
the
corps
will
be
disbanded
here
and
the
members
will
receive
warrants
for
railway
fare
to
their
homes
expenses
connected
with
the
public
reception
of
the
corps
will
be
met
independently
of
the
horse
fund
there
is
a
balance
here
of
about
rs
at
credit
of
the
fund
from
your
telegram
received
from
which
i
thank
infer
that
you
are
returning
with
about
rs
the
settlement
of
account
for
horses
originally
contributed
by
troopers
to
the
corps
has
yet
to
be
made
this
is
rather
a
large
item
if
the
above
balances
be
left
there
should
be
a
fair
sum
at
the
disposal
of
the
corps
after
liabilities
are
met
king
king
have
kindly
undertaken
to
have
waiting
your
arrival

also
to

am
asking
king
king
to
wire

whenever
the

is
sighted
and
again
so
soon
as
they
ascertain
how
many
of
the

are
with

is
necessary
and
desired

there
is

inconsistency
between

military

information
and

with
regard
to
your
numbers
let
me
know

shall
have

great
pleasure
to

on

of
the
bombay
presidency
a
most
cordial
welcome
to
you
members
of
the
gallant
band
some
strong
i
believe
who
left
india
some
ten
months
ago
to
serve
our
in
south
africa
we
have
followed
with
the
deepest
interest
the
fortunes
of
your
gallant
corps
and
we
have
read
with
pride
and
pleasure
the
testimony
that
has
been
borne
to
your
valour
and
your
service
by
conan
doyle
in
his
history
of
the
war
and
from
many
other
sources
we
read
with
pride
and
pleasure
how
you
gentlemen
sacrificing
your
ease
and
comforts
and
the
luxuries
of
your
eastern
life
went
forth
to
do
your
duty
to
your
country
in
south
of
patriotism
to
the
empire
and
worthily
maintaining
the
traditions
of
volunteers
well
indeed
have
the
members
of
horse
merited
the
warm
eulogium
which
the
in
south
africa
paid
to
you
most
truly
did
the
viceroy
say
that
the
whole
of
india
would
greet
your
return
with
enthusiasm
you
gave
us
in
your
first
fight
a
taste
of
the
stuff
of
which
you
were
made
when
you
cut
your
way
through
superior
forces
one
detachment
of
you
having
been
surrounded
and
you
won
our
admiration
by
your
return
when
after
losing
a
large
percentage
of
your
number
every
member
came
back
with
marks
of
bullets
on
him
that
was
but
one
incident
of
your
career
of
honour
throughout
the
campaign
this
is
not
the
occasion
for
anything
in
the
nature
of
a
long
speech
you
are
about
to
proceed
to
calcutta
where
you
will
receive
a
more
formal
but
not
a
more
hearty
welcome
than
we
in
bombay
extend
to
you
we
in
bombay
have
seen
too
many
valiant
soldiers
both
native
and
european
go
forth
from
time
to
time
to
serve
the
not
to
seize
with
pride
and
pleasure
every
opportunity
of
welcoming
them
back
again
it
is
with
interest
that
we
learn
that
many
of
you
remain
to
colonise
and
develop
those
countries
which
you
have
aided
to
enfranchise
some
of
your
comrades
alas
sleep
their
last
an
honoured
sleep
beneath
the
south
african
veldt
they
were
men
who
held
their
lives
as
naught
when
it
came
to
sealing
their
loyalty
with
their
blood
to
their
memory
be
all
honour
and
all
gratitude
paid
by
their
fellows
in
india
you
gentlemen
i
will
repeat
once
more
have
our
heartiest
congratulation
and
our
warmest
welcome
colonel
lumsden
in
reply
said
on
behalf
of
the
corps
which
i
have
the
honour
to
command
let
me
offer
you
our
warmest
thanks
and
gratitude
for
the
very
kind
and
cordial
reception
you
have
given
us
i
believe
the
present
war
was
the
first
which
had
the
honour
of
calling
out
the
volunteers
from
across
the
seas
and
we
as
the
few
who
represented
india
feel
with
deep
respect
and
gratitude
the
warm
welcome
you
have
given
us
on
our
return
gentlemen
turning
to
his
men
i
can
not
make
a
long
speech
but
i
ask
you
all
to
give
three
cheers
for
the
governor
and
the
residents
of
bombay
for
having
given
us
such
a
hearty
welcome
the
members
of
the
corps
responded
to
the
call
lustily
and
the
crowd
answered
again
with
three
cheers
for
horse
a
few
brief
orders
and
the
procession
formed
to
march
to
the
station
it
was
headed
by
the
bodyguard
and
the
carriage
as
far
as
the
floral
fountain
the
band
of
the
then
led
the
way
followed
by
the
bombay
light
horse
and
horse
behind
these
came
numbers
of
carriages
and
on
either
side
pressed
a
crowd
that
seemed
unable
to
show
its
enthusiasm
sufficiently
from
the
offices
of
the
port
trust
by
elphinstone
circle
and
along
hornby
road
every
window
was
occupied
handkerchiefs
were
to
be
seen
waving
on
all
sides
until
even
the
walls
of
the
houses
seemed
to
awake
to
the
wonder
of
the
scene
after
all
it
was
one
such
as
india
has
rarely
witnessed
the
imperial
instinct
was
aroused
the
handful
of
men
following
the
colonel
they
had
bravely
followed
through
all
the
chances
and
changes
of
war
by
whom
they
had
stood
for
the
sake
of
their
country
while
the
bullets
whistled
and
carried
death
around
were
the
embodiment
of
a
great
idea
a
noble
sentiment
and
the
people
saw
and
appreciated
the
crowd
that
had
assembled
to
await
the
arrival
of
the
troops
as
they
passed
along
joined
in
the
march
some
pressed
eagerly
to
speak
to
the
were
content
to
realise
what
it
meant
this
wave
of
patriotism
the
band
in
front
changed
the
march
tune
the
music
seemed
to
become
more
jubilant
as
the
great
mass
of
soldiers
and
people
swung
along
in
step
bombay
was
rejoicing
in
very
truth
the
banners
hung
out
from
the
buildings
told
of
it
the
spirit
of
gladness
pervaded
everything
here
was
a
grand
ending
of
the
old
year
what
would
the
new
year
bring
a
detachment
of
the
bodyguard
had
formed
a
line
outside
the
victoria
terminus
the
bombay
light
horse
took
up
a
position
alongside
the
band
of
one
of
the
native
regiments
played
a
welcome
and
under
the
portico
horse
tramped
in
followed
by
an
enormous
crowd
the
officers
of
the
garrison
had
arranged
to
give
the
corps
dinner
in
the
when
the
meal
was
over
the
guests
were
fairly
besieged
in
the
station
itself
it
seemed
as
if
thousands
of
spectators
had
assembled
they
shook
hands
with
men
luck
and
happy
new
were
heard
everywhere
it
was
a
great
worth
waiting
for
as
the
train
steamed
out
of
the
station
the
building
resounded
again
and
again
with
the
cheering
on
the
line
detonators
sounded
a
parting
salute
and
the
crowd
now
hoarse
with
shouting
dispersed
major
taylor
also
deals
with
these
incidents
briefly
and
then
carries
on
a
lively
narrative
up
to
the
hour
when
horse
having
made
a
record
journey
across
india
arrived
at
calcutta
when
the
troops
landed
there
was
a
great
crowd
with
bands
playing
the
governor
lord
northcote
made
us
a
speech
full
of
kindly
references
and
good
wishes
as
he
bade
us
welcome
home
the
corps
then
marched
with
the
band
and
an
enthusiastic
which
numbers
of
parsees
were
particularly
the
railway
station
there
all
horse
found
themselves
the
honoured
guests
of
the
bombay
garrison
officers
of
the
regulars
and
volunteers
having
combined
with
the
most
gratifying
unanimity
to
give
us
festive
welcome
all
the
regimental
and
private
baggage
had
been
taken
over
by
our
kind
hosts
and
put
on
the
train
so
that
all
the
men
had
to
do
was
just
to
march
into
the
train
great
enthusiasm
prevailed
the
fine
band
of
a
native
regiment
the
bombay
infantry
played
us
off
and
so
amid
much
cheering
the
train
steamed
out
firing
a
salute
in
our
honour
as
it
passed
over
lines
on
which
detonating
signals
had
been
placed
at
regular
intervals
about
at
night
we
passed
a
volunteer
camp
and
stopped
at
the
station
where
bands
were
playing
the
whole
force
from
camp
was
paraded
on
the
platform
a
great
honour
at
that
time
of
night
then
we
went
on
again
at
full
speed
stopping
only
for
meals
at
stations
which
were
dressed
gaily
with
flags
and
at
each
of
these
bands
of
sorts
assembled
and
we
were
entertained
free
of
cost
one
halt
was
called
at
a
very
small
station
but
even
there
we
were
escorted
from
the
train
to
the
by
the
best
band
they
had
it
was
native
and
local
its
instruments
being
one
big
drum
two
kettledrums
three
flutes
two
penny
whistles
that
was
all
they
could
do
but
they
did
it
their
desire
to
honour
us
was
evident
though
their
means
were
the
big
this
demonstration
touched
us
perhaps
even
more
than
the
most
elaborate
ceremonials
prepared
for
our
reception
eventually
at
about
we
reached
calcutta
having
performed
the
journey
in
record
time
which
was
due
entirely
to
the
skill
kindness
and
courtesy
of
wynne

of
the
railway

caused
all
other
traffic
to
be

bringing

from

drew
up
alongside

platform
of
the

company
at
howrah
the
scene
which
the
station
presented
to
the
returning

must
have
struck
those
who
were
not
wrapt
up
in
more
important
personal
concerns
as
exceptionally
bright
and
picturesque
the
of
bengal
his
honour
sir
john
woodburn
paid
to
the

its
commanding
officer
the
great
compliment
of
coming
with
his
staff
and
a
brilliant
escort
to
receive
them
at
the
station
outside
where
the
bengal
lancers
in
their
striking
uniforms
with
pennons
flying
together
with
the
calcutta
light
horse
were
drawn
up
were
long
rows
of
tall
venetian
masts
from
which
strings
of
gaily
coloured
flags
fluttered
in
bold
white
letters
on
a
groundwork
of
red
appeared
as
the
chief
feature
of
an
ornamental
arch
facing
the
entrance
the
roof
of
the
platform
itself
and
the
pillars
were
most
tastefully
decorated
with
festoons
of
evergreens
and
arrangements
of
bunting
when
mention
is
also
made
of
the
ladies
occupying
specially
erected
stands
on
either
side
of
the
gateway
and
of
the
large
and
representative
assembly
of

and
civilian
gathered
sufficient
has
been
said
to
warrant
the
men
of
horse
as
they
looked
out
from
the
carriage
windows
feeling
that
calcutta
was
not
unmindful
of
them
and
had
prepared
a
fitting
reception
as
the
coaches
came
to
a
standstill
the
friends
of
the
in
flocked
round
to
bid
them
welcome
by
a
hearty
grip
of
the
hand
to
exchange
greetings
and
news
there
were
no
scenes
britons
do
not
as
a
rule
make
public
parade
of
their
deepest
feelings
the
occasion
moreover
was
a
gladsome
one
and
it
did
all
present
good
to
note
the
magnificently
robust
health
of
the
men
displayed
in
their
sturdy
figures
and
ruddy
and
bronzed
faces
all
looked
remarkably
fit
and
none
more
so
than
the
gallant
colonel
himself
who
was
first
to
step
from
his
carriage
he
at
once
walked
towards
the
group
where
the
bishop
welldon
general
leach
and
other
distinguished
personages
were
standing
after
a
course
of
the
colonel
directed
his
attention
to
the
detraining
of
his
men
soon
they
were
busily
engaged
in
getting
out
their
kits
when
this
task
was
accomplished
they
were
formed
into
line
and
his
honour
the
said
colonel
lumsden
citizens
of
calcutta
give
you
and
your
gallant
men
of
the
indian
contingent
a
very
hearty
and
enthusiastic
welcome
you
have
had
a
hard
time
abroad
and
suffered
great
privations
but
i
should
like
you
to
know
that
your
career
has
been
followed
by
those
left
behind
in
calcutta
with
the
greatest
admiration
and
pride
gentlemen
all
let
us
give
colonel
lumsden
and
his
gallant
men
three
hearty
cheers
needless
to
say
there
was
a
quick
and
cheerful
response
to
this
request
and
before
it
had
quite
subsided
sir
john
called
for
cheer
more
which
was
given
with
equal
heartiness
colonel
lumsden
in
a
voice
the
huskiness
of
which
betokened
the
depth
of
his
feelings
called
on
the
men
of
the
indian
contingent
to
respond
with
cheers
for
the
their
effort
emphasised
the
fact
that
in
lung
power
and
appreciation
for
sir
john
woodburn
their
trip
to
south
africa
had
effected
no
deteriorating
influences
nor
was
there
anything
wanting
in
the
worth
of
the
response
to
the
gallant
call
for
more
for
the
citizens
of
the
men
then
formed
fours
and
marched
out
to
receive
the
welcome
of
the
thousands
collected
round
the
approaches
to
the
station
and
along
the
route
among
those
present
on
the
platform
were
the

and

it
was
about
a
quarter
to
the
dusk
just
merging
into
dark
when
the
picturesque
procession
swung
over
the
bridge
the
calcutta
light
horse
neat
and
trim
sitting
firmly
in
their
saddles
composed
the
van
the
native
cavalry
from
alipur
men
mounted
on
fretting
horses
then
the
bands
of
four
regiments
the
madrasis
the
bombay
infantry
the
royal
irish
rifles
and
the
calcutta
volunteers
immediately
behind
were
foot
the
bridge
and
its
approaches
were
packed
with
seething
masses
of
people
who
were
with
difficulty
restrained
from
breaking
through
the
ranks
of
the
calcutta
port
defence
and
the
rifle
volunteers
who
lined
each
side
of
the
roadway
and
brought
up
the
rear
of
the
procession
after
horse
had
passed
through
on
the
calcutta
side
of
the
bridge
a
novel
element
was
introduced
the
flanks
of
the
column
being
illuminated
by
numbers
of
men
carrying
acetylene
lamps
on
very
efficient
substitute
for
torches
the
route
taken
was
almost
an
historic
one
for
by
it
all
our
great
viceroys
have
entered
calcutta
but
it
may
safely
be
said
that
never
have
the
strand
road
clive
road
and
that
stretch
flanked
by
magnificent
buildings
which
leads
direct
to
the
maidan
witnessed
scenes
of
more
moving
enthusiasm
than
when
horse
after
perils
oft
and
tribulations
came
marching
home
again
from
howrah
to
the
camp
on
the
maidan
the
roadway
and
buildings
beside
were
lined
with
the
densest
masses
of
humanity
the
eye
can
conceive
the
spectacle
was
a
striking
illustration
of
the
variety
and
numbers
of
the
population
of
calcutta
naturally
the
crowds
were
thickest
in
the
northern
part
of
the
route
where
the
native
city
contributed
its
thousands
but
even
in
the
more
european
part
of
the
town
one
wondered
whence
the
sightseers
had
come
it
is
probably
no
exaggeration
to
say
that
so
large
a
multitude
of
civilian
europeans
has
never
before
been
drawn
together
for
a
similar
demonstration
in
the
east
the
decorations
were
most
tasteful
especially
down
dalhousie
square
south
and
old
court
house
street
where
the
larger
shops
were
brilliantly
lighted
behind
the
groups
of
people
who
thronged
the
verandahs
and
balconies
partly
because
the
oriental
is
by
nature
averse
to
violent
demonstration
and
partly
because
there
does
not
exist
in
india
that
class
which
in
london
streets
there
was
never
any
real
roar
of
sustained
cheering
but
there
could
be
no
mistaking
the
reality
and
fervour
of
the
emotion
that
shook
the
crowd
as
the
returning
warriors
marched
along
besides
no
man
of
horse
could
have
regretted
the
absence
of
that
which
made
more
touching
felicitations
possible
the
repression
of
the
masculine
desire
to
express
feelings
by
making
a
noise
afforded
the
feminine
element
an
opportunity
of
extending
a
pretty
and
graceful
welcome
by
waving
handkerchiefs
and
little
flags
and
uttering
with
each
flutter
some
tiny
cry
of
admiration
and
delight
which
reached
distinctly
the
ears
of
those
for
whom
it
was
meant
the
second
part
of
the
route
was
lined
by
the
troops
in
garrison
including
the
battery
from
barrackpur
along
the
maidan
roads
down
to
the
camp
the
crowds
were
the
least
dense
but
represented
the
most
wealthy
sections
of
the
community
in
dealing
with
them
there
was
not
the
same
necessity
for
police
supervision
and
if
people
broke
through
the
line
of
soldiers
rushing
forward
to
welcome
their
friends
in
the
ranks
and
escorted
them
to
the
camp
why
no
harm
was
done
indeed
unrehearsed
incidents
of
this
kind
added
the
final
touch
to
the
heartiness
and
friendliness
of
greeting
to
those
who
had
fought
for
our
empire
in
a
far
country
when
the
long
procession
drew
near
government
house
in
the
gathering
darkness
the
viceroy
and
lady
curzon
with
their
children
and
a
large
number
of
the
viceregal
staff
walked
to
the
gate
and
standing
on
the
roadway
waved
a
welcome
to
the
corps
as
it
marched
past
the
roads
on
each
side
and
hence
through
the
maidan
skirting
eden
gardens
were
lined
by
companies
of
the
royal
irish
rifles
of
course
the
appearance
and
bearing
of
the
volunteers
whom
all
had
assembled
to
honour
were
keenly
watched
the
men
had
grown
leaner
and
browner
than
when
they
sailed
away
and
their
marching
was
in
strong
contrast
to
the
stiff
upright
gait
of
the
port
defence
volunteers
behind
them
it
happens
that
in
the
stern
actual
business
of
war
men
learn
to
grasp
only
essentials
these
returning
soldiers
had
plumbed
the
realities
of
life
hunger
they
had
known
and
thirst
and
heat
and
cold
and
wounds
and
the
risk
of
death
in
such
conditions
the
formalities
that
surround
the
british
army
in
peace
time
drop
away
soldiers
their
officers
for
instance
it
matters
not
how
one
marches
so
long
as
one
does
march
thus
it
is
that
horse
came
through
the
streets
of
calcutta
with
bodies
swinging
carelessly
forward
with
eyes
eager
and
roving
instead
of
being
fixed
at
with
ranks
loosened
instead
of
being
set
in
compact
stiffness
it
has
sometimes
been
said
that
war
spoils
men
for
drill
but
it
is
something
that
the
volunteer
ranks
in
india
have
been
leavened
by
men
who
know
what
campaigning
is
really
like
the
feeling
of
those
calcutta
volunteers
who
assisted
in
the
procession
was
thus
partly
one
of
pride
for
were
not
horse
also
of
themselves
and
partly
of
prospective
gratitude
for
had
not
the
successes
of
their
comrades
in
the
great
war
opened
the
way
for
their
own
employment
also
no
longer
can
it
be
said
that
unless
volunteers
attain
an
irreproachable
precision
in
drill
and
smartness
in
bearing
they
are
useless
as
fighting
men
large
crowds
of
persons
natives
and
equipages
of
all
descriptions
followed
the
corps
up
to
the
camp
where
gunners
of
the
field
battery
lined
the
way
on
arrival
there
three
hearty
cheers
were
given
for
the
men
of
horse
the
cheers
being
repeated
over
and
over
till
the
men
were
dismissed
in
camp
the
scene
was
an
animated
one
men
of
the
corps
singly
and
in
groups
were
centres
of
attraction
to
friends
and
strangers
alike
conversation
was
free
eager
questions
being
answered
and
questions
repeated
and
answered
over
and
over
again
the
scene
was
well
illuminated
a
little
camp
of
twenty
tents
has
been
pitched
on
the
old
cricket
ground
of
the
calcutta
cricket
club
exactly
south
of
the
eden
gardens
the
camp
has
been
furnished
in
ordinary
military
style
and
is
pitched
in
rows
of
three
with
one
tent
for
the
officers
of
the
corps
a
large
mess
tent
a
canteen
and
the
usual
necessaries
camp
furniture
only
is
allowed
consisting
of
a
wooden
with
a
straw
mattress
and
pillow
and
a
few
zinc
tubs
and
basins
for
lavatory
purposes
the
mess
tent
consists
of
four
fly
tents
open
at
the
sides
with
a
long
table
big
enough
to
accommodate
a
hundred
hungry
men
running
along
its
entire
length
after
dinner
the
men
were
formed
up
at
and
marched
into
the
town
hall
where
they
arrived
at
after
a
short
stay
downstairs
they
were
ordered
upstairs
where
a
most
brilliant
reception
awaited
them
this
evening
reception
at
the
town
hall
was
an
entire
success
the
decorations
of
the
hall
were
most
elaborate
and
characterised
by
great
taste
on
the
landing
upstairs
in
addition
to
greenery
in
profusion
a
number
of
naval
and
a
hotchkiss
machine
gun
nordenfeldts
and
maxims
were
arranged
to
form
a
central
group
all
these
being
flanked
by
a
number
of
small
ancient
brass
cannons
and
howitzers
a
daïs
was
erected
in
the
centre
of
the
hall
facing
the
main
entrance
which
was
occupied
by
his
excellency
the
viceroy
lady
curzon
his
honour
the
the
general
leach
sir
buck
bishop
welldon
sir
maclean
lady
jenkins
and
others
while
the
space
in
front
was
roped
off
and
here
stood
in
lines
the
members
of
horse
whose
colonel
as
the
party
passed
through
presented
to
his
excellency
every
officer
of
the
corps
in
turn
no
time
was
lost
after
the
arrival
of
lord
and
lady
curzon
in
proceeding
with
the
object
of
the
gathering
his
excellency
the
viceroy
said
colonel
lumsden
officers
and
men
of
horse
is
not
yet
a
year
since
i
was
bidding
you
farewell
at
kidderpur
docks
you
had
appointed
me
the
honorary
colonel
of
a
corps
of
volunteers
that
had
never
seen
warfare
but
that
was
starting
out
at
the
call
of
duty
and
in
many
cases
at
great
personal
sacrifice
to
fight
for
the
queen
and
the
empire
now
you
have
come
back
the
and
veterans
of
a
long
and
arduous
campaign
and
we
are
all
here
this
evening
to
welcome
you
home
and
to
do
you
honour
i
your
honorary
colonel
am
as
proud
of
you
as
if
i
had
been
through
the
campaign
at
your
side
which
being
a
man
of
peace
i
am
very
glad
to
think
that
i
was
not
called
upon
to
do
and
all
of
us
here
the
citizens
of
calcutta
who
subscribed
to
your
outgoing
and
have
kept
a
watch
upon
you
ever
since
feel
a
sort
of
parental
glow
at
receiving
back
again
our
one
corps
of
indian
volunteers
to
south
africa
who
have
shown
that
the
englishman
in
india
is
not
one
whit
behind
his
countrymen
at
home
or
his
cousin
in
the
colonies
in
daring
and
risking
and
suffering
for
the
flag
that
waves
above
us
all
for
we
know
well
through
what
hardships
and
experiences
you
have
passed
since
you
steamed
away
down
the
hugli
in
february
last
the
one
characteristic
that
has
struck
me
most
in
this
south
african
campaign
has
been
the
physical
strain
and
suffering
which
it
has
imposed
we
have
robbed
travel
and
sport
and
adventure
nowadays
of
most
of
their
roughness
but
war
even
when
your
enemy
is
out
of
sight
and
you
scarcely
ever
set
eyes
upon
him
though
it
has
lost
in
romance
has
not
lost
think
it
has
peril
and
privation
we
have
followed
you
in
your
breathless
marches
across
the
dismal
veldt
in
your
assaults
upon
those
deadly
kopjes
in
your
days
of
endurance
and
fighting
in
your
grim
nights
under
the
cold
stars
we
have
commiserated
you
when
some
of
your
number
were
taken
prisoners
but
we
were
consoled
when
we
heard
that
you
were
more
frequently
the
pursuers
than
the
pursued
that
you
captured
far
more
of
the
enemy
than
the
enemy
did
of
you
we
felt
a
thrill
of
pleasure
when
you
were
praised
by
the
generals
and
above
all
by
the
brave
old
who
knew
what
our
men
from
india
could
do
and
when
you
were
publicly
thanked
in
despatches
we
all
of
us
felt
as
if
our
own
names
had
appeared
in
the
one
thousand
five
hundred
miles
of
marching
actions
of
one
kind
or
all
this
in
the
space
of
ten
months
this
is
not
a
bad
record
for
our
pioneer
body
of
indian
volunteers
i
was
delighted
colonel
lumsden
that
in
one
respect
you
most
strictly
obeyed
the
final
instructions
which
as
your
commanding
officer
in
mufti
i
ventured
to
address
to
you
in
february
of
last
year
i
urged
you
and
your
men
to
be
there
or
thereabouts
when
the
british
forces
entered
pretoria
knowing
your
keen
sense
of
discipline
it
was
with
no
surprise
that
i
learned
that
on
june
horse
marched
into
that
place
in
the
van
of
lord
occupying
force
i
only
regret
that
i
did
not
issue
a
few
more
timely
injunctions
to
you
such
for
instance
as
the
capture
of
general
de
wet
since
i
have
little
doubt
that
you
would
have
carried
them
out
to
the
letter
there
was
one
other
remark
that
i
made
a
year
ago
to
which
i
must
allude
i
said
that
there
were
some
among
those
whom
i
was
addressing
who
might
have
to
face
the
supreme
peril
without
which
war
can
not
be
waged
you
all
of
you
carried
your
lives
in
your
hands
and
a
few
of
your
number
have
handed
in
your
cheques
at
the
great
audit
but
we
rejoice
that
it
was
only
a
brave
and
heroic
fraction
but
still
only
a
fraction
you
lost
your
second
in
command
the
gallant
major
showers
whom
nature
had
intended
for
a
soldier
and
whom
destiny
in
his
first
encounter
claimed
as
a
hero
but
besides
him
only
five
others
were
killed
while
two
only
died
of
disease
in
the
entire
campaign
indeed
the
total
casualties
were
fewer
than
which
in
a
force
of
over
men
is
i
think
a
very
remarkable
result
i
doubt
not
that
all
the
rest
of
you
have
often
faced
death
and
that
many
have
triumphed
over
disease
so
much
the
more
cause
is
there
for
satisfaction
at
coming
back
on
your
part
and
for
rejoicing
on
ours
colonel
lumsden
i
am
only
addressing
less
than
one
half
of
the
force
that
mustered
before
me
a
year
ago
some
have
stayed
behind
in
africa
to
continue
in
the
regular
army
in
the
police
or
in
civil
appointments
the
good
service
which
they
have
rendered
during
the
past
ten
months
though
they
are
far
away
and
have
cut
the
painter
from
india
we
include
them
in
our
gratitude
and
others
have
already
gone
back
to
their
indian
homes
and
have
been
unable
to
attend
here
we
honour
them
in
honouring
you
in
their
distant
plantations
or
in
their
employments
wherever
they
may
be
possibly
they
will
read
of
this
gathering
and
will
know
that
they
equally
have
their
places
in
our
reception
as
for
the
rest
of
those
here
present
you
colonel
lumsden
will
always
have
the
pride
of
recollecting
that
it
was
to
your
initiative
and
liberality
that
this
corps
owed
its
being
and
that
in
the
history
of
the
war
it
bore
your
name
with
credit
and
without
a
stain
while
you
officers
and
men
as
you
revert
to
your
several
avocations
in
civil
life
and
as
the
past
year
fades
into
a
hazy
dream
will
never
forget
that
at
a
critical
moment
in
the
fortunes
of
your
country
you
came
forward
and
staked
much
endured
much
and
wrought
much
for
the
honour
of
the
greatest
thing
on
the
british
name
officers
and
men
it
was
a
pride
to
me
to
bid
you
nearly
a
year
ago
it
is
an
inexpressible
pleasure
to
me
to
welcome
you
back
this
evening
and
to
thank
you
in
the
name
of
india
for
what
you
have
done
in
the
service
of
the
empire
colonel
lumsden
said
your
excellency
your
honour
ladies
and
gentlemen
feel
it
though
a
pleasure
a
hard
task
to
endeavour
to
express
the
feelings
of
my
men
and
myself
for
the
very
hearty
welcome
we
have
received
and
the
very
kind
speech
which
our
honorary
colonel
the
viceroy
has
given
us
this
evening
our
honorary
colonel
mentions
and
with
truth
his
words
of
advice
in
speaking
to
us
on
leaving
we
no
doubt
did
our
best
to
act
up
to
it
in
every
way
and
i
am
sure
speaking
for
myself
as
leader
there
was
no
difficulty
to
do
so
when
followed
by
such
men
as
i
had
it
was
not
altogether
a
party
of
pleasure
there
were
rough
things
and
hard
times
and
i
often
feared
that
the
indian
man
accustomed
as
he
always
is
to
the
would
not
take
to
the
labour
of
the
veldt
as
well
as
he
did
i
can
assure
your
excellency
that
never
at
any
moment
when
things
were
at
their
worst
did
i
hear
a
word
that
was
not
cheerful
and
pleasant
from
my
men
we
have
been
a
fortunate
corps
in
more
ways
than
one
we
have
been
specially
fortunate
in
our
health
as
our
honorary
colonel
remarked
only
two
men
in
the
whole
corps
died
of
sickness
this
i
think
shows
in
a
great
measure
how
well
the
soldiers
were
treated
there
have
been
many
complaints
i
believe
in
several
quarters
as
to
the
treatment
of
the
soldiers
there
but
taking
the
class
of
men
i
had
to
deal
with
the
small
percentage
of
deaths
from
disease
shows
we
had
not
much
to
complain
about
in
that
respect
we
were
fortunate
also
in
our
list
of
casualties
we
were
all
very
much
touched
by
the
allusions
to
those
who
have
gone
no
better
man
existed
than
major
showers
no
greater
loss
could
be
felt
by
the
corps
than
in
his
death
he
died
i
believe
as
he
often
thought
he
would
he
was
a
soldier
to
the
backbone
and
nothing
pleased
him
better
than
being
in
the
field
five
died
besides
major
showers
giving
a
total
of
six
altogether
that
out
of
men
may
be
looked
upon
as
a
small
percentage
on
the
whole
in
spite
of
the
hardships
the
men
have
gone
through
i
think
there
is
not
one
if
the
call
to
arms
were
sounded
who
would
not
love
to
go
back
again
we
were
greatly
honoured
at
having
the
viceroy
as
our
honorary
colonel
and
that
pleasure
was
deeply
felt
by
the
men
and
remained
in
their
memory
throughout
the
campaign
when
any
meed
of
praise
was
bestowed
upon
us
one
and
all
felt
sure
our
honorary
colonel
would
be
pleased
to
hear
of
it
i
can
not
make
a
long
speech
i
think
the
viceroy
himself
touched
upon
most
of
the
points
of
interest
connected
with
the
corps
i
can
only
say
how
pleased
we
are
with
the
reception
we
have
got
when
we
landed
in
bombay
the
governor
said
a
few
kindly
words
the
streets
were
lined
by
thousands
of
people
and
we
had
a
welcome
such
as
we
can
never
forget
another
thing
i
would
wish
to
touch
upon
i
think
all
the
corps
are
proud
of
the
number
of
commissions
our
men
have
got
for
this
we
have
entirely
to
thank
the
the
from
start
to
finish
there
is
no
doubt
his
love
of
india
led
lord
roberts
to
take
a
keen
interest
in
our
indian
corps
our
welcome
to
calcutta
will
i
am
sure
sink
deeply
into
all
our
hearts
and
be
long
remembered
i
can
only
say
on
behalf
of
my
officers
and
comrades
that
i
thank
you
all
deeply
and
sincerely
in
doing
so
i
feel
certain
i
am
expressing
the
gratitude
of
us
all
not
only
for
what
we
have
received
but
what
i
am
told
we
have
yet
to
receive
i
thank
you
sir
very
heartily
indeed
on
behalf
of
the
whole
corps
for
the
extremely
kind
way
in
which
you
have
spoken
of
us
and
our
work

temporary
barriers

been
removed

their
many
friends

at
right
angles
to
that

of
an
exceptionally
chaste
and
artistic
character

the
verandah
the
members

the
band
were
located

the
most
appropriate

and
bright
the

taken
up
heartily
by

congregation
and
a
magnificent
rendering
was
given
by

of
the
chorus
to
which
result
the
inclusion
of
a
number
of
ladies
in

at

of
the
service
filed
out
immediately
behind
the
choir
and
the
clergy
the
following
was
the
address
which
the
metropolitan
delivered
it
is
my
privilege
brethren
to
offer
you
in
the
house
of
god
the
words
of
welcome
which
have
been
in
all
hearts
and
upon
all
lips
since
your
landing
in
last
words
perhaps
that
shall
be
addressed
to
you
as
a
military
force
it
was
here
on
the
fourteenth
day
of
february
last
that
you
sought
blessing
at
a
special
service
before
setting
sail
for
the
war
and
it
is
here
by
a
natural
consequence
that
you
come
again
to
render
him
thanks
on
your
return
brethren
we
have
followed
you
with
earnest
prayers
in
your
long
absence
there
has
not
been
a
sunday
when
we
have
not
entreated
god
to
bless
you
and
keep
you
safe
and
to
give
victory
to
your
arms
and
to
bring
you
home
in
peace
you
will
not
say
or
think
those
prayers
have
been
unheard
the
memory
of
the
friends
who
were
far
away
of
their
care
for
you
and
their
sympathy
in
your
perils
must
often
have
been
present
to
your
minds
it
may
even
have
happened
that
you
felt
strengthened
and
inspired
as
others
have
felt
by
the
consciousness
of
their
intercession
in
your
behalf
brethren
you
have
fought
not
in
a
light
cause
but
for
the
empire
whose
members
and
citizens
you
are
you
have
been
the
witnesses
and
in
part
the
authors
of
a
new
solidarity
between
the
widely
severed
forces
of
the
empire
that
solidarity
is
the
great
fact
the
permanent
result
of
the
war
in
south
africa
its
influence
upon
the
destiny
of
mankind
will
be
more
and
more
declared
in
the
century
a
new
spirit
of
confederation
has
dawned
upon
the
empire
and
it
is
your
spirit
and
the
spirit
of
men
such
as
you
may
i
remind
you
of
a
sentence
spoken
by
a
high
authority
on
a
critical
occasion
in
modern
european
history
goethe
relates
that
after
the
battle
of
valmy
at
which
he
was
present
he
was
asked
by
his
comrades
in
camp
to
pronounce
an
opinion
upon
its
significance
he
his
language
may
have
seemed
extravagant
when
he
used
this
place
and
from
this
day
forth
commences
a
new
era
in
the
history
and
you
can
all
say
that
you
were
present
at
its
brethren
the
birthday
of
imperial
solidarity
is
likewise
an
event
fraught
with
issues
of
untold
power
and
moment
for
mankind
but
that
solidarity
has
been
born
in
south
africa
and
you
can
all
say
that
you
were
present
at
its
birth
once
more
you
have
realised
and
we
too
how
great
and
solemn
is
the
cost
of
an
imperial
destiny
it
is
not
by
mere
play
but
by
sorrow
pain
and
death
that
a
empire
like
a
universal
church
is
achieved
and
maintained
you
have
hazarded
your
lives
some
of
your
comrades
have
laid
theirs
down
for
that
high
cause
and
the
issue
of
your
sacrifice
and
theirs
has
been
a
solemnisation
of
the
empire
in
the
last
year
it
has
been
good
for
us
that
we
have
known
the
reverses
and
anxieties
which
ennoble
the
ultimate
victory
we
have
felt
the
hand
of
god
laid
upon
us
you
who
have
come
home
and
we
who
bid
you
so
glad
a
welcome
shall
spend
the
residue
of
our
lives
with
an
enhanced
moral
seriousness
with
a
more
profound
apprehension
of
the
providence
which
regulates
and
determines
human
ends
brethren
i
shall
not
detain
you
longer
in
this
holy
place
only
let
your
be
worthy
of
your
warfare
there
are
dangers
in
peace
as
well
as
in
war
let
the
spirit
then
of
your
future
lives
be
grave
responsible
temperate
sublime
as
befits
your
religion
and
your
race
may
the
god
of
our
fathers
bless
you
all
and
bring
you
all
to
heaven
the
of
monday
january
gave
the
following
report
of
another
interesting
scene
immediately
after
the
thanksgiving
service
held
at
the
cathedral
on
thursday
the
officers
and
men
of
our
pioneer
corps
celebrated
the
closing
function
of
their
active
military
career
it
took
its
form
in
a
dinner
given
expressly
by
colonel
lumsden
and
the
guests
included
sir
patrick
playfair
the
hon
buckingham
colonel
maclaughlin
harry
stuart
and
several
friends
of
the
officers
and
men
after
an
excellent
dinner
supplied
by
wallace
of
the
italian
restaurant
who
also
catered
for
the
corps
prior
to
their
departure
in
february
last
the
toast
of
the
queen
was
proposed
and
received
with
enthusiasm
private
turner
in
a
very
apt
little
speech
then
asked
the
colonel
if
he
would
very
kindly
consent
to
present
on
behalf
of
the
men
to
hewitt
dale
and
brennan
souvenirs
to
mark
their
appreciation
of
the
admirable
work
done
by
these
three
officers
they
always
had
the
knack
of
taking
the
men
the
proper
way
to
dale
or
dale
was
due
the
excellent
form
in
which
the
men
found
themselves
they
looked
none
the
worse
for
their
trying
marches
and
watchful
nights
simply
because
the
man
in
charge
of
the
food
arrangements
was
dale
colonel
lumsden
said
he
had
much
pleasure
in
presenting
on
behalf
of
the
men
a
silver
flask
to
hewitt
a
silver
flask
to
dale
and
a
silver
to
brennan
the
colonel
then
proposed
the
health
of
the
executive
committee
who
he
said
had
worked
so
indefatigably
when
the
corps
was
being
organised
their
labours
did
not
end
there
however
for
always
while
the
corps
was
in
south
africa
and
still
on
its
return
they
were
all
concerned
in
its
and
interests
it
was
a
pleasure
to
him
and
to
his
men
to
have
been
the
recipients
of
so
hearty
a
welcome
as
that
which
met
them
on
their
arrival
at
howrah
on
the
evening
of
the
inst
the
work
which
the
raising
of
a
force
such
as
horse
entails
is
extensive
complicated
and
laborious
but
thanks
to
the
able
committee
formed
on
the
inception
of
the
corps
they
were
able
to
be
equipped
and
despatched
to
the
country
they
had
just
returned
from
with
comparatively
no
delay
to
sir
patrick
playfair
particularly
he
was
deeply
indebted
for
his
energy
in
seeing
things
put
through
in
such
an
efficient
manner
and
without
a
hitch
and
he
was
proud
of
now
having
an
opportunity
of
asking
his
men
to
drink
the
health
of
the
gentlemen
of
the
executive
committee
with
three
times
three
cheers
for
sir
patrick
playfair
sir
patrick
playfair
in
reply
said
that
he
was
sorry
another
very
important
public
function
required
the
presence
of
many
of
the
executive
committee
who
otherwise
would
have
been
present
at
this
dinner
colonel
lumsden
he
thought
was
too
lavish
in
his
praises
of
the
work
done
by
the
executive
committee
the
work
was
a
labour
of
love
in
the
execution
of
which
every
member
of
that
committee
took
a
pleasure
and
a
pride
he
had
met
and
known
colonel
lumsden
very
many
years
before
a
certain
day
in
november
when
he
received
from
australia
a
cable
from
colonel
lumsden
intimating
his
willingness
to
raise
and
have
equipped
a
suitable
corps
capable
of
giving
a
good
account
of
themselves
in
south
africa
he
had
the
fullest
confidence
in
colonel
lumsden
and
knew
that
the
class
of
men
to
whom
colonel
lumsden
had
particular
recourse
were
the
right
sort
he
therefore
did
his
utmost
to
encourage
colonel
lumsden
in
accomplishing
his
noble
object
great
obstacles
for
a
time
blocked
the
way
but
in
time
by
virtue
of
the
personal
influence
of
his
excellency
the
viceroy
the
war
office
sanctioned
the
raising
of
a
corps
which
has
now
returned
loaded
with
honours
complimented
time
after
time
by
generals
and
in
official
despatches
for
gallantry
in
the
field
the
committee
always
followed
with
interest
the
operations
of
the
corps
in
south
africa
and
it
was
a
pride
and
an
honour
to
them
to
be
in
a
position
to
say
that
they
were
so
closely
connected
with
its
formation
he
regretted
that
a
few
men
should
have
found
their
appointments
closed
against
them
on
their
return
but
he
assured
them
that
the
executive
committee
and
particularly
himself
would
only
be
too
glad
to
help
any
man
in
finding
suitable
employment
he
said
he
had
already
made
reference
to
the
cases
of
men
so
placed
to
the
and
had
asked
that
all
things
else
being
equal
the
men
who
had
served
in
horse
should
have
the
preference
when
appointments
were
vacant
sir
patrick
playfair
then
thanked
colonel
lumsden
the
officers
and
men
of
the
corps
for
the
hearty
way
in
which
they
had
drunk
the
health
of
the
committee
sergeant
fraser
then
in
a
very
humorous
speech
announced
to
the
colonel
the
intention
of
the
men
to
present
him
with
a
sword
of
honour
as
a
memento
and
a
token
of
their
respect
and
esteem
within
the
last
few
days
they
had
heard
the
governor
of
bombay
the
of
bengal
and
the
viceroy
himself
express
warm
admiration
of
colonel
lumsden
for
the
manner
in
which
he
had
conceived
organised
and
led
the
corps
but
he
ventured
to
consider
that
the
men
of
horse
were
even
in
a
better
position
than
these
exalted
gentlemen
to
express
an
opinion
upon
colonel
lumsden
for
they
had
been
with
him
in
south
africa
and
seen
with
their
own
eyes
what
he
had
done
it
was
in
consequence
of
what
they
had
seen
that
they
now
asked
colonel
lumsden
to
accept
from
the
men
who
had
been
his
comrades
a
sword
of
honour
as
the
highest
compliment
they
knew
how
to
pay
him
he
would
remind
them
that
colonel
lumsden
during
the
action
at
ospruit
had
ridden
out
to
the
rescue
of
a
wounded
trooper
placed
him
on
his
own
horse
and
led
the
horse
back
at
a
walk
a
distance
of
yards
all
under
heavy
fire
colonel
lumsden
had
never
asked
his
men
to
go
where
he
did
not
lead
himself
and
it
will
be
within
the
recollection
of
all
of
them
after
climbing
kopjes
representing
kinchingjunga
at
six
stone
that
they
invariably
found
the
colonel
on
top
busy
with
his
binoculars
whilst
they
themselves
were
helpless
from
loss
of
breath
his
concern
had
always
been
for
his
men
without
regard
to
his
own
convenience
and
it
was
because
colonel
lumsden
had
proved
himself
both
gallant
and
unselfish
that
they
desired
to
present
him
with
the
sword
if
they
had
a
fault
to
find
with
colonel
lumsden
it
was
that
he
was
too
lenient
with
misdemeanants
they
had
frequently
seen
men
marched
before
him
and
sternly
interrogated
regarding
their
sins
but
the
end
of
such
interviews
was
generally
a
private
conversation
regarding
old
times
in
assam
or
elsewhere
and
no
punishment
the
result
was
that
the
men
swore
by
their
colonel
even
those
he
had
been
compelled
to
send
to
was
one
of
these
half
rear
at
the
present
moment
loudly
applauding
all
he
was
saying
colonel
lumsden
was
not
only
their
commanding
officer
but
a
personal
friend
to
each
man
a
combination
which
had
led
to
the
maintenance
of
an
extraordinary
degree
of
discipline
they
were
all
proud
of
the
corps
they
had
the
honour
to
belong
to
but
they
were
prouder
if
possible
of
the
officer
whose
name
the
corps
bore
the
only
fault
they
ever
found
with
colonel
lumsden
was
that
he
was
too
lenient
with
the
men
and
in
the
goodness
of
his
heart
refrained
from
meting
out
punishment
where
it
was
perhaps
well
deserved
however
it
is
not
every
delinquent
who
would
regard
that
as
a
fault
the
men
regretted
that
time
had
not
given
them
an
opportunity
of
providing
the
sword
for
presentation
that
night
but
it
would
come
in
the
fulness
of
time
the
health
was
then
drunk
with
musical
honours
the
men
shouting
themselves
hoarse
illustration
ceremonial
sword
colonel
lumsden
in
reply
said
that
this
was
truly
and
in
every
sense
the
proudest
moment
of
his
life
he
had
already
had
the
pleasure
of
making
a
few
speeches
since
the
corps
was
raised
but
he
found
it
a
difficult
thing
to
hit
on
words
to
express
at
all
adequately
his
appreciation
of
the
eulogistic
terms
in
which
sergeant
fraser
on
behalf
of
his
comrades
had
referred
to
him
he
always
had
the
greatest
confidence
in
his
men
and
relied
on
their
honour
rather
than
on
strict
and
rigid
discipline
for
the
execution
of
his
orders
he
knew
his
men
thoroughly
and
saw
that
they
were
prepared
to
play
the
game
as
it
should
be
played
and
he
felt
proud
as
any
officer
must
of
the
men
he
commanded
the
sword
of
honour
proposed
to
be
presented
to
him
would
be
his
most
treasured
would
always
be
proud
to
refer
to
it
and
the
happy
associations
it
recalled
the
past
twelve
months
had
been
the
happiest
in
his
whole
career
and
nigh
summers
had
passed
over
his
head
turning
to
sir
patrick
remark
he
said
that
he
too
would
do
his
utmost
to
have
the
men
without
billets
provided
for
he
was
a
believer
in
the
great
future
in
store
for
south
africa
and
wished
every
success
to
those
of
the
corps
who
had
remained
behind
he
also
said
that
captain
petley
had
very
kindly
placed
the
at
the
disposal
of
those
who
had
no
friends
to
stay
with
in
calcutta
and
that
they
only
had
to
signify
to
captain
petley
who
had
taken
a
deep
interest
in
the
corps
their
wish
to
avail
themselves
of
this
kind
offer
he
would
now
say
and
with
every
good
wish
for
their
future
welfare
requesting
that
before
breaking
up
camp
every
man
should
promise
to
send
his
photo
the
men
were
visibly
touched
by

and
after
cheering
him
over
and
over
again

full
of

aspirations
these
indian
volunteers
who
had
made
for
themselves
a
name
that
will
long
be
honoured
among
british
soldiers
were
disbanded
so
the
curtain
fell
on
the
war
scene
in
which
the
two
hundred
and
fifty
men
known
to
history
as
horse
played
their
parts
they
had
been
in
the
field
ten
months
marched
from
camp
to
camp
over
miles
fought
in
actions
lost
seven
men
killed
in

several
at
various
times
incapacitated
by
wounds
they
had
left
nearly
sixty
of
their
number
in
south
africa
some
as
administrators
some
in
the
regular
army
and
some
in
the
police
they
had
brought
back
to
calcutta
only
four
of
the
horses
with
which
they
started
and
had
used
up
remounts
they
had
been
twice
mentioned
in
despatches
by
the
and
had
been
praised
by
every
general
under
whom
they
served
out
of
a
total
of
fifteen
officers
one

lumsden
was
decorated
by

troopers
preston
betts
dexter
and
regimental
marsham
while
seven
other
and
troopers
were
mentioned
in
despatches
it
is
a
noteworthy
fact
that
of
all
those
whose
names
were
brought
forward
by
colonel
lumsden
not
one
failed
to
obtain
recognition
from
the
and
only
three
received
less
honourable
distinctions
than
their
colonel
thought
they
were
entitled
to
all
these
things
prove
that
nobody
was
recommended
except
for
meritorious
services
of
which
clear
and
conclusive
evidence
could
be
given
all
soldiers
will
appreciate
what
that
means
and
of
who
obtained
commissions
in
the
regular
army
and
others
gazetted
to
irregular
corps
only
two
resigned
subsequently
colonel
lumsden
was
exceptionally
fortunate
in
securing
this
number
of
commissions
and
still
more
fortunate
in
selecting
men
worthy
to
retain
them
it
must
not
be
forgotten
however
that
the
majority
of
those
serving
in
the
ranks
of
horse
were
public
school
boys
some
of
whom
may
have
failed
in
their
examinations
for
sandhurst
and
gone
out
to
fight
their
way
in
india
as
indigo
tea
and
coffee
planters
and
who
when
the
occasion
arose
were
just
the
right
men
to
fill
the
appointments
they
got
their
merits
were
recognised
not
only
by
our
own
military
authorities
but
also
by
the
enemy
one
boer
told
the
rev
siddons
of
great
berkhampstead
whose
letter
is
quoted
by
permission
that
horse
were
good
both
at
scouting
and
the
same
authority
also
says
that
he
had
similar
testimony
to
their
merits
from
a
corporal
of
one
of
the
cavalry
regiments
this
is
not
surprising
as
horse
and
their
comrades
of
the
line
were
always
on
good
terms
and
had
a
mutual
admiration
for
each
other
in
a
letter
to
the
colonel
trooper
morison
says
i
am
afraid
i
can
not
help
you
much
with
my
personal
experiences
and
views
no
doubt
everyone
who
writes
you
on
the
subject
will
be
full
of
praise
and
admiration
for
thomas
atkins
as
we
found
him
on
the
veldt
but
i
should
like
to
record
what
a
splendid
chap
he
is
whether
scotch
irish
welsh
or
from
any
other
part
of
the

he
is
all
the

a

qualities
of
the
who
had
won

spurs
in

at
the
beginning
of

many
of

at

portions
of
the

the
one
at
benoni
for
the
protection
of
cattle
refugees
and
the
mines
was
deemed
an
important
duty
as
the
neighbourhood
had
been
in
a
very
disturbed
state
for
months
past
and
from
time
to
time
had
been
visited
by
small
parties
of
boers
these
were
always
put
to
flight
by
the
ordinary
mounted
patrols
but
on
boxing
day
at
the
alarm
was
given
that
a
strong
force
of
boers
was
in
the
vicinity
immediate
defensive
measures
were
taken
and
when
a
party
of
of
the
enemy
rode
up
to
the
post
office
they
were
accorded
a
greeting
very
different
from
the
christmas
one
of

they
scuttled
but
later
a
second
party
engaged
the
right
flank
of
the

post
a
second

they
were
compelled
to
retire

poor

his

most
dangerous
points

took
up
a
very
strong
position
on
the
left
front
from

they
harassed
the
gallant
little
body
of
defenders
finding
that
was
ineffective

three
guards
every
night
our
three
guards
are
posted
round
the
enclosure
where
the
cattle
are
kept
at
about
yards
in
front
one
in
an
empty
dynamite
magazine
about
yards
in
rear
and
the
third
one
is
posted
near
where
we
sleep
we
live
in
a
corrugated
iron
room
on
the
top
of
a
gold
dump
up
to
is
about
feet
from
the
ground
a
verandah
runs
round
it
which
we
have
fortified
with
sandbags
we
have
also
dug
trenches
all
round
the
room
as
a
big
body
of
boers
is
reported
to
be
in
laager
twenty
miles
from
same
commando
that
paid
us
so
much
attention
on
famous
march
we
had
hardly
settled
down
here
before
the
boers
paid
us
a
visit
on
december
i
was
on
guard
with
a
railway
pioneer
regiment
man
and
at
i
suddenly
heard
the
sound
of
whips
as
if
cattle
were
being
driven
out
of
the
kraal
i
immediately
fired
two
shots
in
rapid
succession
this
had
the
desired
effect
of
hurrying
the
boers
out
of
the
kraal
and
at
the
same
time
of
warning
the
other
men
there
was
a
small
moon
up
and
we
could
just
distinguish
a
dark
body
of
men
at
this
we
fired
as
fast
as
we
could
load
and
had
the
satisfaction
of
completely
surprising
the
boers
several
of
whom
we
hit
they
had
got
all
the
cattle
out
of
the
kraal
but
were
in
such
a
hurry
to
get
away
that
they
left
these
all
behind
they
exchanged
a
few
shots
when
at
a
safe
distance
but
where
their
bullets
went
none
of
us
know
as
none
came
in
our
direction
after
this
they
left
us
in
peace
till
december

nicolay
reinforced
after
the
first
attack
we
mustered
guns
on
the
morning
of
the
a
day
never
to
be
forgotten
by
the
little
garrison
at
benoni
the
boers
attacked
us
at
in
large
force
numbering
over
three
hundred
men
with
two
and
a
maxim
those
not
on
guard
were
in
bed
when
tooley
who
was
outside
the
room
shouted
that
the
boers
were
on
us
we
rushed
out
as
quickly
as
we
could
and
had
just
time
to
get
into
the
trenches
before
a
body
of
about
fifty
boers
charged
down
upon
us
in
regular
cavalry
fashion
we
waited
till
they
were
within
yards
and
then
we
gave
them
a
volley
which
cooled
their
ardour
a
bit
and
sent
them
back
in
hot
haste
with
a
few
of
their
saddles
emptied
they
then
took
up
positions
on
mounds
right
round
us
and
began
to
pour
in
a
hot
from
ranges
varying
from
to
yards
using
rifles
of
every
description
even
fowling
pieces
as
we
heard
several
charges
of
buckshot
scatter
over
us
poor
walker
whom
we
all
liked
exposed
himself
and
was
shot
immediately
we
returned
their
fire
as
well
as
we
could
bowling
over
a
good
few
both
horses
and
men
we
exchanged
rifle
shots
till
when
finding
that
they
could
not
dislodge
us
they
brought
their
and
maxim
up
and
for
half
an
hour
gave
us
as
lively
a
time
as
we
have
ever
had
our
room
was
riddled
from
top
to
bottom
any
kit
hanging
on
the
walls
being
perforated
the
noise
of
the
shells
going
through
the
corrugated
iron
was
most
terrific
and
made
us
feel
pretty
queer
we
had
to
lie
low
in
our
trenches
expecting
shells
to
drop
into
the
middle
of
us
at
any
moment
the
boers
crept
closer
under
cover
of
the
but
luckily
for
us
the
supply
of
ammunition
gave
out
then
recommenced
and
we
soon
drove
them
back
to
their
original
positions
they
had
fired
whole
belts
of
shells
at
us
at
a
time
so
you
can
imagine
the
lively
time
we
had
was
kept
up
till
when
the
boers
decamped
on
seeing
reinforcements
arriving
from
johannesburg
and
boksburg
they
burnt
two
mines
and
several
and
looted
the
stores
before
they
cleared
out
we
have
had
great
praise
for
holding
out
so

have
received

dear

asked
me
last
night
to
note
down
briefly
some
details
of
the
attack
on
the
chimes
west
mine
here
are
the
facts
as
well
as
i
remember
them
we
had
a
police
post
at
this
mine
on
the
rand
about
nine
miles
from
boksburg
a
place
you
will
find
on
all
maps
our
force
consisted
of
sixteen
railway
pioneer
regiment
and
nine
horse
the
latter
under
sergeant
walker
on
the
morning
of
december
this
small
was
located
in
what
i
may
term
the
first
floor
of
the
of
the
chimes
west
attacked
by
boers
who
had
with
them
two
illustration
kelly
the
boers
fired
volleys
and
a
good
many
shells
went
through
the
quarters
occupied
by
horse
i
saw
dozens
of
not
only
through
the
iron
sheets
which
formed
the
walls
of
their
quarters
but
also
through
the
great
wooden
beams
or
baulks
of
a
foot
or
more
in
diameter
from
one
of
the
earliest
of
these
volleys
sergeant
walker
was
killed
as
he
was
kneeling
behind
a
sandbag
our
men
were
under
fire
for
several
hours
and
seeing
that
we
were
so
greatly
outnumbered
tolley
volunteered
to
ride
through
the
boers
into
boksburg
a
distance
of
nine
miles
and
did
gallant
feat
kelly
grenville
and
jones
volunteered
to
make
a
dash
for
a
tailings
or
so
as
to
enfilade
the
boers
kelly
and
grenville
got
home
horse
fell
and
he
fractured
his
arm
and
lay
there
kelly
and
grenville
did
excellent
work
from
the
tailings
heap
and
made
it
so
uncomfortable
for
the
boers
that
they
had
to
shift
their
position
i
was
there
next
day
and
met
general
barton
on
the
ground
on
receipt
of
his
report
the
lord
kitchener
wired
us
the
following
message
police
on
gallant
defence
benoni
deplore
loss
of
their
lord
kitchener
is
temperate
in
praise
so
i
take
it
his
commendation
meant
much
i
understand
that
three
of
the
men
whose
names
i
have
given
above
have
been
since
mentioned
in
despatches
on
account
of
their
behaviour
on
december
lockhart
of
horse
became
senior
sergeant
on
death
and
is
a
gallant
old
fellow
he
is
much
younger
than
i
but
everyone
dubs
him
old
he
behaved
very
well
his
name
should
be
mentioned
in
any
account
of
this
particular
incident
our
men
saved
the
chimes
west
mine
what
this
means
you
can
infer
from
what
the
boers
did
to
the
modderfontein
mine
close
by
which
our
men
could
not
defend
in
less
than
half
an
hour
the
boers
did
damage
estimated
at
from
to
we
buried
poor
walker
on
december
at

a

has
been
subscribed
for

will
be
gratefully
appreciated
by
all
those
who
have
received
kind
treatment
at
their
hands
and
by
the
british
public
colonel
lumsden
on
his
return
to
london
applied
to
get
pay
for
his
men
raised
to
the
colonial
standard
of
per
diem
but
was
told
by
lord
george
hamilton
that
as
indian
taxpayers
would
not
be
asked
to
contribute
to
the
cost
either
of
the
war
in
south
africa
or
of
the
war
in
china
it
would
be
quite
impossible
to
make
up
the
difference
between
the
british
standard
of
pay
and
the
colonial
standard
the
cape
colony
and
natal
governments
had
in
special
cases
defrayed
the
difference
out
of
their
own
exchequers
on
applying
to
the
secretary
of
state
for
war
the
colonel
was
informed
by
brodrick
that
were
his
request
granted
the
whole
of
the
yeomanry
who
went
out
in
would
be
entitled
to
a
similar
increase
and
therefore
he
could
not
assist
colonel
lumsden
in
explanation
said
the
request
had
not
been
made
by
any
of
the
men
themselves
but
by
him
on
their
account
and
although
a
sense
of
duty
to
them
had
impelled
him
to
make
this
claim
he
considered
that
they
would
be
all
the
prouder
for
having
served
their
country
on
a
day
for
nearly
eighteen
months
after
the
disbandment
of
the
corps
its
former
colonel
gave
up
his
time
to
details
connected
with
it
in
the
event
of
another
volunteer
contingent
being
despatched
from
india
it
is
doubtful
whether
anyone
of
colonel
position
and
resources
would
take
such
an
interest
in
the
force
or
would
have
the
time
to
give
to
work
that
might
be
more
properly
undertaken
by
the
war
office
colonel
lumsden
endeavoured
successfully
to
get
employment
for
those
of
his
troopers
who
had
given
up
lucrative
engagements
to
join
the
corps
there
were
certain
men
who
could
not
obtain
their
former
appointments
and
their
old
commandant
devoted
his
time
and
attention
to
further
their
interests
he
found
that
however
willing
the
government
of
india
and
the
government
of
bengal
were
to
find
employment
for
these
men
in
government
service
as
some
recognition
of
what
they
had
done
for
the
empire
while
serving
with
horse
neither
the
viceroy
nor
the
of
bengal
had
appointments
at
his
disposal
owing
to
the
system
of
competitive
examination
for
all
posts
under
their
administration
therefore
colonel
lumsden
was
greatly
indebted
to
merchants
tea
proprietors
and
others
for
the
help
they
gave
him
in
obtaining
situations
for
certain
of
his
men
the
fact
that
no
appointments
are
reserved
for
the
benefit
of
soldiers
or
sailors
who
have
served
their
country
well
is
a
blot
on
the
competitive
system
both
in
india
and
in
england
it
may
prove
to
be
a
serious
discouragement
to
the
desire
for
volunteering
in
future
emergencies
very
few
even
among
colonel
most
intimate
friends
and
old
comrades
know
that
after
all
his
hard
work
he
went
out
to
india
again
in
the
first
week
of
december
with
instructions
from
the
war
office
to
raise
another
corps
of
indian
volunteers
for
service
in
south
africa
provided
sufficient
numbers
of
the
right
class
of
men
were
available
on
arrival
in
calcutta
and
after
consultation
with
his
excellency
the
viceroy
colonel
lumsden
wrote
to
officers
commanding
the
different
volunteer
corps
from
whose
ranks
most
of
his
previous
contingent
had
been
recruited
their
replies
showed
however
that
the
three
great
industries
indigo
tea
and
coffee
were
not
in
a
position
to
bear
another
strain
so
soon
the
sporting
offer
therefore
came
to
nothing
his
efforts
however
were
appreciated
both
by
the
secretary
of
state
for
war
and
by
the
and
duly
recognised
in
a
letter
of
thanks
from
the
colonel
lumsden
and
sir
patrick
playfair
have
hardly
yet
finished
their
labours
in
connection
with
the
corps
of
which
all
accounts
have
been
carefully
audited
by
lovelock
lewes
the
actuaries
in
calcutta
and
have
been
balanced
to
a
point
showing
the
expenditure
in
india
to
equip
the
corps
the
remittances
made
to
south
africa
for
urgent
requirements
all
disbursements
in
connection
with
the
disbandment
of
the
corps
and
the
balance
that
remains
these
accounts
may
be
valuable
in
the
future
as
guides
to
the
probable
expenditure
in
similar
cases
and
they
are
interesting
now
as
proving
the
accuracy
of
calculations
made
at
the
outset
whereby
the
cost
of
equipping
and
maintaining
such
a
force
in
the
field
for
twelve
months
was
estimated
at
rupees
per
man
exclusive
of
gifts
in
kind
in
dealing
with
accounts
previous
to
disbandment
of
the
corps
much
valuable
assistance
was
given
by
major
ramsden
controller
of
military
accounts
bengal
but
for
the
completeness
and
accuracy
of
and
other
regimental
documents
great
credit
is
due
to
fraser
of
the
bank
of
bengal
and
to
his
assistant
paymaster
graves
of
the
same
bank
both
of
whom
did
hard
clerical
work
under
difficulties
in
the
office
without
neglecting
their
duties
as
soldiers
after
all
expenses
are
paid
there
will
probably
be
a
balance
of
twenty
or
thirty
thousand
rupees
in
hand
colonel
lumsden
has
suggested
that
it
can
not
be
devoted
to
a
better
purpose
than
as
a
subsidy
towards
the
maintenance
of
a
paying
ward
for
sick
or
disabled
volunteers
in
the
new
general
hospital
in
calcutta
the
general
wish
is
that
this
should
henceforth
be
known
as
the
horse
ward
in
commemoration
of
men
who
did
good
service
to
their
country
at
some
personal
sacrifice
to
the
memory
of

who
fell
in
battle
or
passed
through
the
portals
of
sickness
to
infinite
peace

of

has
paid
tribute
by
the
erection
of

the

taylor
contributes
the
following
notes
and
suggestions
for
consideration
there
were
a
certain
number
of
points
which
struck
me
very
forcibly
during
the
campaign
and
i
should
like
to
give
them
for
what
they
are
worth
there
may
be
certain
conditions
to
be
considered
the
importance
of
which
outweighs
all
others
so
that
the
following
notes
must
be
regarded
only
as
an
attempt
to
carry
out
the
duty
which
every
man
owes
to
his
profession
by
showing
things
in
the
light
in
which
he
saw
them
higher
authorities
busy
about
big
affairs
fail
sometimes
to
notice
the
important
details
with
which
juniors
are
brought
in
daily
contact
corps
started
from
india
with
one
horse
per
man
and
the
necessary
complement
of
transport
animals
there
were
a
few
casualties
on
the
journey
which
were
replaced
at
cape
town
and
the
corps
began
work
in
good
condition
but
with
no
spare
animals
the
supposition
apparently
is
that
men
fall
out
just
as
fast
as
the
horses
this
did
not
prove
correct
in
south
africa
and
it
is
hard
to
believe
that
it
would
be
so
elsewhere
provided
the
work
required
was
of
an
active
mounted
kind
therefore
true
economy
would
seem
to
dictate
the
provision
of
spare
horses
very
soon
with
us
a
few
horses
got
slight
sore
backs
but
as
every
mounted
man
available
was
required
it
was
found
impossible
to
ease
these
horses
the
inevitable
result
being
that
after
a
few
days
they
were
unfit
for
work
consequently
a
similar
number
of
men
had
to
be
taken
from
the
fighting
strength
and
their
saddles
put
into
the
carts
as
the
work
continued
more
horses
gave
out
and
more
loads
were
put
into
the
carts
hence
while
the
transport
animals
grew
weaker
their
loads
grew
heavier
to
take
figures
the
nominal
strength
of
the
mounted
portion
of
the
corps
was
men
actually
the
largest
number
we
ever
had
in
action
was
the
average
in
the
fighting
line
was
under
of
the
remainder
fifty
were
short
on
account
of
sickness
and
casualties
and
fifty
on
account
of
horses
short
had
we
had
fifty
spare
horses
every
available
man
could
have
been
mounted
as
a
matter
of
fact
thirty
spare
horses
would
probably
have
sufficed
as
on
the
principle
of
stitch
in
time
the
timely
of
trivial
as
a
slight
sore
back
or
temporary
have
saved
many
a
usefulness
or
life
the
further
you
go
the
more
necessary
such
reliefs
become
the
exact
number
of
spare
horses
depends
upon
the
class
of
work
required
to
my
mind
this
is
one
of
the
lessons
we
should
learn
from
the
boers
who
generally
had
two
horses
per
man
and
often
five
these
spare
horses
can
conveniently
march
with
the
veterinary
hospital
and
be
taken
care
of
by
a
small
staff
working
on
this
principle
horse
kept
every
man
mounted
during
two
ceaseless
trek
and
the
horses
were
practically
all
fit
and
well
at
the
end
of
it
on
the
other
system
each
man
used
up
seven
horses
in
as
many
months
to
put
it
in
brief
a
corps
of
men
and
horses
with
their
baggage
would
at
the
end
of
a
hard
marching
and
fighting
be
less
efficient
than
a
corps
of
men
with
horses
in
that
they
would
have
no
more
mounted
men
in
the
field
while
their
transport
would
have
to
carry
food
and
kit
for
the
extra
fifty
men
in
addition
to
the
fifty
saddles
of
the
dismounted
men
weighing
some
five
stones
each
and
also
probably
the
fifty
dismounted
men
themselves
the
same
principles
affect
the
question
of
the
number
of
baggage
animals
of
carrying
equipment
for
ammunition
to
be
carried
by
the
man
took
the
shape
of
a
belt
with
two
cross
braces
on
the
former
were
leather
pouches
to
hold
packets
of
cartridges
and
on
the
latter
bandolier
attachments
to
take
single
cartridges
the
disadvantages
were
many
it
necessitated
the
man
carrying
a
heavy
weight
constantly
on
his
body
or
else
hiding
packets
of
ammunition
in
his
holsters
whence
they
were
difficult
to
extract
and
where
he
often
left
them
in
the
hurry
of
a
dismount
the
pouches
were
a
great
discomfort
to
the
men
when
lying
down
to
snatch
rest
in
the
many
short
intervals
at
their
disposal
the
whole
weight
of
the
ammunition
came
on
to
the
saddle
when
the
man
was
mounted
and
went
some
way
towards
causing
sore
backs
marching
on
foot
with
this
load
of
ammunition
was
so
irksome
that
it
soon
tired
the
soldier
and
made
him
urge
and
take
every
possible
excuse
for
remaining
mounted
proposed
is
to
give
every
man
two
bandoliers
holding
fifty
rounds
each
and
a
to
take
fifty
rounds
the
bandoliers
to
be
habitually
buckled
round
the
neck
like
collars
when
going
into
action
the
man
can
transfer
one
or
both
bandoliers
to
his
own
shoulders
even
without
dismounting
should
he
have
the
amount
of
ammunition
required
and
have
left
one
or
both
of
these
bandoliers
on
his
horse
they
can
be
sent
for
and
found
with
no
difficulty
the
distribution
being
also
very
simple
taking
the
weight
of
this
ammunition
off
the
saddle
helps
to
save
sore
back
the
man
will
walk
unencumbered
and
consequently
will
walk
more
readily
and
can
do
so
for
longer
distances
besides
being
in
a
better
state
for
duties
when
he
gets
to
camp
on
a
similar
principle
the
rifle
should
not
be
carried
by
the
soldier
when
marching
dismounted
as
it
is
better
to
keep
his
weight
say
eleven
stone
off
the
back
as
long
as
possible
and
it
will
be
longer
if
you
put
the
seven
pounds
on
to
the
horse
and
not
on
to
the
man
in
excess
of
this
rounds
per
man
should
be
and
was
carried
on
a
led
mule
or
horse
who
could
keep
up
with
the
mounted
men
caused
us
much
trouble
as
every
kind
of
ground
entailed
a
different
stamp
of
a
small
iron
peg
did
not
hold
in
sandy
soil
wooden
ones
broke
in
rocky
ground
while
the
bundle
of
rope
and
pegs
was
an
extra
weight
on
the
horse
and
caused
the
saddle
to
roll
besides
making
the
man
less
handy
at
getting
on
and
off
his
horse
the
remedy
was
to
have
no
or
pegs
carried
on
the
saddle
horse
and
to
substitute
three
big
iron
pegs
with
fifty
yards
of
and
a
heavy
mallet
to
every
fifty
men
carried
on
a
with
the
ammunition
mules
on
arrival
in
camp
these
pegs
were
driven
in
the
line
rope
stretched
between
them
and
the
horses
tied
to
each
side
of
it
by
their
were
not
found
necessary
this
worked
perfectly
except
on
detached
duties
when
perhaps
ten
men
were
separated
for
some
when
they
had
to
their
tie
them
together
by
their
in
a
circle
heads
inwards
they
are
unable
to
lie
down
in
comfort
which
is
of
course
a
weak
point
but
it
does
not
often
happen
the
object
to
be
attained
was
to
cover
as
much
ground
as
possible
it
was
found
best
to
trot
long
stages
with
walking
intervals
between
when
the
men
were
made
to
dismount
and
lead
the
man
should
never
be
on
his
horse
except
when
going
faster
than
a
walk
it
was
found
better
to
trot
a
good
deal
than
to
walk
and
lead
even
because
the
time
saved
by
the
faster
pace
gave
the
men
and
horses
time
for
an
appreciable
rest
and
for
food
while
they
were
which
should
always
be
done
when
the
movements
in
any
way
admit
of
it
horse
in
marching
order
is
supposed
to
carry
one
complete
set
of
shoes
if
every
man
were
trained
to
see
constantly
that
his
shoes
were
on
firm
a
shoe
ought
seldom
to
be
lost
if
a
farrier
is
present
and
the
man
has
the
necessary
nails
a
doubtful
or
loose
nail
can
be
drawn
and
replaced
hence
we
made
the
rule
that
the
men
should
not
carry
spare
shoes
but
should
carry
nails
and
we
had
the
farriers
with
us
occasionally
a
horse
lost
a
shoe
when
on
detached
duty
but
only
then
and
after
all
if
the
rider
is
careful
no
serious
damage
should
result
in
any
case
it
is
not
worth
while
for
every
horse
to
carry
a
complete
set
of
shoes
always
on
the
chance
of
one
horse
requiring
one
shoe
occasionally
usefulness
of
may
be
gathered
to
a
certain
extent
from
the
fact
that
none
of
the
officers
had
chargers
killed
by
anything
but
bullets
every
officer
had
an
indian
syce
and
when
a
horse
had
had
a
hard
time
it
was
found
that
one
day
marching
with
the
syce
restored
him
the
follower
has
nothing
to
think
about
except
to
feed
the
horse
when
he
can
and
it
is
wonderful
what
good
one
hour
in
a
field
of
green
wheat
or
on
a
good
bit
of
grass
does
for
a
tired
and
underfed
animal
besides
the
follower
often
chances
on
a
bundle
or
two
of
or
some
such
luxury
and
in
any
case
the
horse
has
plenty
of
time
for
grazing
during
the
delays
of
the
march
the
men
latterly
employed
kaffir
boys
to
a
considerable
extent
paying
them
wages
out
of
their
own
pockets
these
kaffirs
received
no
rations
living
on
their
leavings
and
occasional
steaks
out
of
dead
horses
taking
all
considerations
together
it
would
appear
to
be
a
saving
to
use
the
soldier
as
much
as
possible
for
fighting
purposes
and
to
use
native
followers
for
all
work
that
does
not
entail
fighting
cooks
and
syces
even
in
small
numbers
would
to
a
great
extent
ease
the
fighting
man
of
arduous
labour
which
the
follower
could
do
just
as
well
we
should
have
fewer
cases
of
sickness
from
want
of
rest
and
lack
of
time
to
cook
properly
if
a
few
native
cooks
accompanied
each
regiment
and
a
few
syces
might
save
the
lives
of
many
horses
that
have
to
be
neglected
by
the
men
when
after
a
long
march
and
perhaps
a
fight
they
are
ordered
out
on
picket
directly
they
arrive
in
camp
the
native
is
cheaper
to
feed
and
more
docile
to
manage
not
minding
things
which
tommy
as
cutting
grass
for
instance
his
food
is
simple
and
he
can
eat
it
very
comfortably
going
along
the
road
so
that
when
he
gets
into
camp
he
is
quite
fit
to
go
to
work
i
was
told
by
an
officer
of
the
indian
transport
train
who
was
with
general
force
in
natal
that
he
had
taken
his
corps
with
his
native
followers
right
through
to
belfast
and
landed
his
animals
there
without
a
single
casualty
and
not
only
well
but
fat
he
attributed
it
solely
to
the
fact
that
the
servants
understood
their
work
and
would
unload
without
a
murmur
a
dozen
times
a
day
and
cut
a
heap
of
grass
for
every
animal
when
they
got
to
camp
why
not
employ
the
cheaper
labourer
and
save
the
dearer
for
work
that
suits
him
better
and
which
the
follower
can
not
do
the
answer
i
am
aware
is
that
an
armed
transport
man
can
help
to
defend
the
convoy
this
is
of
course
true
to
a
limited
extent
our
transport
men
never
had
a
chance
of
firing
a
shot
and
i
think
few
had
all
the
and
were
driven
by
kaffirs
on
the
same
grounds
as
advocated
so
why
not
apply
the
reasoning
to
other
cases
the
argument
in
favour
of
the
armed
transport
reminds
one
of
the
sportsman
who
goes
out
armed
with
a
gun
rifle
and
ready
for
all
emergencies
but
never
has
the
right
weapon
in
his
hand
when
the
game
springs
up
the
spare
are
another
case
of
the
same
thing
and
there
are
many
others
it
is
impossible
to
provide
for
every
contingency
a
general
way
the
rations
were
very
good
but
one
or
two
improvements
suggest
themselves
first
everyone
who
has
tried
it
knows
that
when
spirits
are
not
available
the
body
acquires
a
great
craving
for
sugar
which
is
no
doubt
recognised
and
hence
the
jam
issue
chocolate
is
cheap
by
which
i
mean
light
to
carry
and
is
enormously
appreciated
but
more
important
than
anything
appear
to
be
the
tea
coffee
or
cocoa
rations
because
in
a
great
measure
on
the
plentifulness
of
these
depends
the
amount
or
otherwise
of
many
diseases
notably
enteric
no
man
will
boil
water
and
let
it
cool
simply
because
he
knows
a
healthy
thing
to
do
but
he
will
boil
it
to
have
a
good
drink
of
hot
tea
if
you
give
him
enough
he
will
have
his
drink
before
he
goes
to
bed
another
in
the
morning
and
he
will
also
fill
his
with
it
half
an
ounce
per
man
will
accomplish
this
i
believe
the
amount
allowed
per
man
in
south
africa
was
oz
by
the
time
this
had
been
distributed
in
the
dark
the
ration
became
so
small
that
men
used
to
toss
for
the
lot
in
the
hope
that
one
at
least
would
get
a
good
drink
tea
moreover
is
very
light
an
load
is
which
is
rations
of
oz
each
which
means
that
men
could
be
given
oz
of
tea
daily
for
a
month
at
the
cost
of
one
added
to
the
convoy
on
our
trek
from
machadodorp
to
pretoria
we
carried
supplies
for
about
men
for
about
a
month
and
the
convoy
was
many
long
and
i
do
not
think
that
one
added
thereto
would
have
given
any
trouble
off
value
of
this
practice
on
occasions
is
another
of
the
lessons
we
might
learn
from
the
boers
i
do
not
pretend
that
the
shooting
is
accurate
yet
it
has
a
great
moral
advantage
in
certain
circumstances
imagine
yourself
on
a
big
rolling
veldt
doing
rearguard
the
slopes
are
easy
and
the
ridges
about
yards
from
crest
to
crest
you
hold
one
and
the
enemy
the
next
in
order
to
keep
your
horses
out
of
fire
they
must
be
yards
or
so
away
all
is
well
till
you
begin
to
retire
but
on
rising
you
at
once
become
visible
to
the
boer
who
first
of
all
shoots
at
you
and
then
follows
you
up
at
a
gallop
to
have
a
shot
at
you
before
you
can
gain
the
next
ridge
you
retire
in
a
hurry
run
the
risk
of
being
shot
and
have
the
demoralising
feeling
that
the
enemy
is
gaining
rapidly
on
you
and
will
at
before
you
gain
the
next
ridge
leave
near
the
ridge
a
few
mounted
men
place
them
back
so
far
that
while
they
can
see
the
ridge
the
enemy
can
only
possibly
see
their
heads
and
shoulders
and
order
your
dismounted
men
to
retire
crawling
at
first
then
stooping
and
finally
rising
they
do
this
leisurely
as
they
can
see
the
mounted
sentinels
watching
and
they
are
reassured
these
sentinels
have
no
fear
for
they
can
at
any
time
retire
at
a
gallop
while
the
enemy
hearing
the
firing
do
not
like
advancing
on
an
unknown
number
during
the
march
from
machadodorp
to
pretoria
this
practice
enabled
us
to
do
in
perfect
comfort
a
rearguard
duty
which
was
considered
by
all
other
corps
very
with
regard
to
raising
mounted
volunteer
corps
in
the
the
actual
experiences
of
the
fighting
in
south
africa
there
were
one
or
two
points
in
connection
with
the
raising
of
the
corps
itself
which
came
to
my
special
notice
in
the
course
of
my
duties
as
adjutant
and
quartermaster
the
knowledge
of
which
would
i
think
facilitate
matters
in
the
event
of
anyone
raising
another
volunteer
corps
in
india
for
active
service
in
my
opinion
the
most
important
point
of
all
is
to
make
certain
that
secrecy
is
maintained
before
any
steps
are
taken
for
enrolling
men
the
adjutant
and
other
officers
from
the
regular
army
should
be
selected
and
apportioned
their
work
in
connection
with
the
raising
of
the
corps
the
should
be
chosen
and
the
official
scheme
drawn
up
the
first
duty
falls
on
the
and
it
should
be
properly
organised
in
every
detail
three
or
four
rooms
store
accommodation
a
shorthand
writer
at
least
three
or
four
competent
clerks
as
well
as
mounted
orderlies
are
necessary
a
camp
pitched
complete
in
every
detail
should
be
ready
to
receive
the
men
especial
attention
being
paid
to
the
provision
of
a
temporary
mess
for
the
men
as
well
as
and
canteens
and
of
a
native
for
followers
this
can
all
be
done
when
the
arrangements
are
complete
the
intention
to
raise
the
corps
and
the
terms
may
be
made
public
if
the
fact
of
the
raising
of
the
corps
had
not
leaked
out
government
would
of
course
have
made
all
the
above
suggested
arrangements
and
things
would
have
gone
smoothly
from
the
outset
as
it
was
every
government
official
assisted
colonel
lumsden
to
his
utmost
power
as
a
sample
of
this
i
may
mention
that
at
their
own
request
the
one
squadron
of
the
bengal
lancers
at
alipur
supplied
eight
mounted
orderlies
daily
for
six
weeks
rendering
invaluable
assistance
in
carrying
letters
this
same
squadron
marked
out
the
camp
for
us
and
lent
their
shops
for
the
use
of
the
swarm
of
servants
who
came
in
attendance
on
the
volunteers
another
difficulty
which
it
would
be
good
to
avoid
if
possible
was
that
under
existing
regulations
it
was
found
to
be
impossible
to
attest
the
men
until
the
day
before
embarkation
so
that
for
some
weeks
they
were
in
camp
and
being
trained
without
being
under
military
law
their
good
feeling
alone
preserved
discipline
certain
number
of
men
who
were
specialists
in
various
lines
such
as
saddlers
farriers
signallers
and
together
with
a
sprinkling
of
officers
were
lent
to
the
corps
from
the
regular
army
and
they
were
of
the
greatest
use
to
us
it
is
essential
that
the
selection
of
these
be
made
with
great
care
there
is
little
doubt
that
the
gentleman
volunteer
is
not
always
easy
to
get
on
with
so
that
the
regular
should
be
a
man
of
character
and
tact
when
called
upon
for
men
commanding
officers
send
fully
qualified
men
but
have
a
tendency
to
a
man
a
in
novel
circumstances
unless
a
regular
is
a
tactful
good
fellow
he
is
unlikely
to
be
of
much
use
with
volunteers
of
far
as
we
could
learn
from
our
experience
in
south
africa
the
three
main
points
in
the
selection
of
a
horse
are
hardiness
true
action
while
for
convenience
in
mounting
and
dismounting
he
should
not
be
over
fifteen
hands
high
comparative
slowness
light
legs
and
slight
unsteadiness
do
not
seem
to
matter
but
he
must
be
hardy
he
must
be
clear
of
any
suspicion
whatever
of
brushing
and
he
must
be
the
sort
likely
to
on
sticks
and
the
work
is
all
very
slow
but
it
is
continuous
there
were
practically
no
cases
of
lameness
from
sprains
or
indeed
of
anything
except
and
after
a
work
the
horse
which
could
go
the
furthest
and
fastest
was
the
one
that
kept
the
best
condition
one
of
the
horses
that
did
the
best
work
in
the
corps
was
a
little
boer
pony
of
private
which
was
only
about
twelve
hands
high
as
transport
animals
our
little
ponies
did
most
excellently
and
were
better
than
mules
in
that
while
they
were
quite
as
hardy
they
were
heavier
and
more
game
calcutta
the
quays
are
only
a
few
feet
above
the
and
as
the
horses
all
have
to
be
put
on
the
upper
and
main
decks
the
custom
is
to
them
on
board
by
means
of
cranes
and
tackle
attached
to
i
saw
a
whole
ship
being
laden
with
horses
in
this
way
the
operation
took
one
entire
day
and
cost
five
rupees
per
horse
one
horse
at
least
was
dropped
and
had
to
be
destroyed
a
large
proportion
suffered
injuries
and
all
were
terrified
on
meeting
the
officer
in
charge
afterwards
i
learnt
that
hardly
any
of
the
horses
would
feed
at
all
for
a
day
at
least
for
us
the
authorities
erected
a
zigzag
gangway
by
the
aid
of
which
horses
were
put
on
board
without
accident
in
one
hour
and
a
half
moreover
the
gangway
could
not
have
cost
communication
gangways
between
the
decks
were
also
fitted
up
thus
enabling
us
to
transfer
horses
from
one
deck
to
another
and
these
proved
very
valuable
in
dealing
with
sick
cases
during
the
voyage
on
the
ship
each
horse
had
a
stall
in
a
row
each
stall
being
just
big
enough
for
a
horse
to
stand
in
and
surrounded
by
a
rail
on
the
were
fixed
four
strong
battens
two
inches
square
in
cross
section
at
intervals
of
eighteen
inches
the
fore
feet
fell
naturally
on
to
the
first
batten
and
his
hind
feet
on
to
the
last
he
was
thus
forced
to
stand
always
in
a
constrained
position
for
my
own
horses
i
had
the
battens
otherwise
distributed
putting
one
six
inches
from
either
end
and
one
in
the
middle
the
fore
feet
came
naturally
behind
the
first
batten
and
the
hind
feet
before
the
rear
one
while
the
middle
one
did
not
interfere
with
the
position
and
was
only
used
by
the
horse
when
necessitated
by
bad
weather
it
was
i
think
a
great
improvement
this
was
not
my
idea
but
was
what
the
australian
horse
recommend
and
use
orders
in
the
service
are
that
all
horses
go
on
board
shod
which
is
contrary
to
the
custom
of
the
big
australian
shipping
firms
who
say
that
shod
horses
slip
up
when
it
is
rough
we
had
no
rough
weather
and
so
could
not
prove
this
but
owing
to
the
shoe
keeping
the
foot
off
the
constantly
damp
boards
the
feet
of
our
horses
were
on
arrival
in
infinitely
better
condition
than
those
of
the
horses
brought
over
by
australian
to
india
horses
on
board
is
i
learn
never
done
but
we
gave
the
idea
a
trial
and
it
turned
out
to
be
quite
practicable
our
ship
was
a
very
small
one
and
we
had
some
difficulty
about
space
for
exercise
ground
however
we
found
three
places
in
different
parts
of
the
ship
where
we
could
get
a
small
circle
matting
was
put
down
to
prevent
slipping
and
it
was
found
that
on
each
of
these
ten
horses
could
be
led
at
a
time
one
behind
the
other
in
this
manner
we
managed
to
give
every
horse
half
an
hour
a
day
of
walking
exercise
while
these
ten
horses
were
out
the
next
ten
had
twice
as
much
room
to
stand
in
which
enabled
the
men
to
give
them
grooming
it
was
very
noticeable
how
the
legs
with
the
exercise
and
it
must
have
been
a
great
relief
to
the
horse
our
horses
landed
in
very
good
condition
and
except
for
being
soft
they
were
fit
to
go
to
work
at
once
it
is
obviously
only
possible
to
exercise
horses
like
this
when
you
have
a
large
number
of
hands
as

excellency
lord
curzon
honorary
colonel
not
only
for
having
sanctioned

graciously
gave

and
for

interest
he
took
in
our
operations
on
active
service
i
take
the
opportunity
at
the
completion

again
to
thank
the
public
for
the
splendid
manner

for
the
cordial
way
they
welcomed

appendix
xi
horse
the
following
article
is
by
sergeant
stephens
of
the
indian
commissariat
and
transport
department
attached
to
horse
the
government
of
india
at
the
last
moment
not
sanctioning
native
drivers
for
the
corps
fifty
europeans
had
to
be
enlisted
under
the
same
terms
as
those
of
trackers
receiving
kit
equipment
as
there
was
no
time
to
pick
and
choose
the
men
were
taken
if
physically
fit
more
by
personal
appearances
than
recommendations
with
the
exception
of
a
few
they
worked
remarkably
well
and
never
complained
of
the
hardships
they
had
to
endure
while
we
were
in
south
africa
when
each
member
joined
the
corps
he
was
handed
over
a
pair
of
ponies
or
mules
also
harness
for
same
with
cart
complete
the
majority
of
them
had
never
driven
or
ridden
a
horse
in
their
lives
so
that
the
of
horses
and
men
was
not
an
easy
task
of
fifty
pairs
of
animals
received
for
draught
purposes
not
a
pair
was
broken
to
harness
and
when
the
heavy
breechen
was
placed
on
their
backs
they
did
their
best
to
kick
it
off
but
the
girths
supplied
by
government
were
strong
enough
to
keep
that
in
place
our
next
difficulty
was
to
put
them
together
in
carts
immediately
the
curricle
bar
or
iron
support
rested
on
their
backs
they
wanted
to
be
off
for
their
lives
and
in
some
instances
got
away
and
did
a
lot
of
mischief
before
they
came
to
grief
cart
and
all
privates
hyde
and
braine
once
trying
to
stop
a
pair
got
severely
hurt
hyde
putting
his
shoulder
out
while
braine
got
his
head
badly
cut
both
were
sent
to
the
general
hospital
for
treatment
but
recovered
in
time
to
join
b
company
the
transport
men
were
very
willing
took
a
delight
in
their
duty
and
worked
hard
from
to
daily
and
at
that
rate
we
were
able
to
have
the
worst
of
the
animals
broken
to
harness
before
we
left
calcutta
at
the
same
time
the
men
were
improving
daily
in
the
care
and
treatment
of
animals
and
when
the
general
officer
commanding
held
his
inspection
every
one
of
them
was
able
to
drive
or
seemed
to
think
he
could
so
we
had
a
transport
out
for
inspection
after
inspecting
carts
animals
and
drivers
the
general
expressed
himself
pleased
with
the
very
ready
way
in
which
they
had
been
got
in
order
and
stated
that
he
thought
we
should
get
on
well
in
africa
the
men
had
not
the
slightest
idea
of
what
a
muleteer
was
until
they
got
on
board
ship
then
the
work
started
and
dirty
work
it
was
for
about
two
hours
every
morning
even
then
there
were
no
complaints
the
officer
commanding
the
corps
and
the
captain
of
the
ship
gave
great
praise
to
the
transport
men
every
day
for
having
the
cleanest
deck
the
captain
afterwards
said
that
with
regular
troops
he
had
never
seen
it
better
kept
they
had
to
perform
the
same
duties
as
the
troopers
the
only
difference
being
that
they
had
extra
work
daily
from
to
dubbing
and
cleaning
harness
while
on
board
ship
the
transport
of
a
company
was
divided
into
four
sections
consequently
four
officers
had
to
be
made
this
was
the
first
promotion
in
the
transport
and
was
given
to
those
who
seemed
to
take
most
interest
in
their
work
the
names
of
men
promoted
were
power
palmer
cullen
and
estabrooke
power
afterwards
worked
up
to
sergeant
was
a
very
good
officer
throughout
and
quite
deserved
the
rank
he
held
work
on
board
ship
was
the
same
daily
nothing
fresh
occurring
till
we
landed
at
cape
town
that
night
carts
had
to
be
got
ready
and
the
following
morning
we
had
to
take
our
own
baggage
to
maitland
camp
that
was
about
the
worst
day
we
had
while
in
africa
it
was
impossible
to
look
to
our
would
not
face
the
was
not
sand
but
small
stones
beating
against
our
faces
and
our
eyes
were
sore
for
weeks
after
our
first
day
at
the
cape
it
was
very
hard
to
harness
the
transport
animals
in
carts
but
after
being
about
days
on
board
ship
they
had
not
much
mind
for
bolting
that
first
day
the
camp
when
we
got
there
was
in
sand
maitland
at
that
time
was
a
dirty
hole
and
we
were
pleased
when
we
got
our
orders
to
shift
but
a
few
things
happened
during
our
stay
there
which
we
can
not
forget
the
government
came
on
us
thinking
we
had
too
many
carts
and
they
had
to
be
reduced
by
ten
so
we
handed
our
ten
carts
and
ten
pairs
of
ponies
to
the
transport
officer
cape
town
and
instead
of
them
got
pairs
of
mules
with
leader
harness
complete
to
act
as
leaders
for
our
remaining
carts
that
meant
instead
of
two
ponies
to
a
cart
as
we
left
india
we
had
to
put
four
ponies
or
mules
this
complicated
matters
a
long
time
for
some
of
the
drivers
could
never
manage
so
had
to
be
left
with
a
pair
only
they
said
that
two
which
they
would
insist
upon
calling
their
chargers
were
quite
enough
for
them
to
look
after
in
the
end
everything
turned
out
very
well
we
kept
those
animals
spare
and
whenever
any
in
the
teams
showed
signs
of
fatigue
got
lame
or
otherwise
unfit
we
had
others
to
take
their
places
the
transport
officer
at
the
cape
did
not
think
much
of
his
bargain
he
could
not
get
the
cape
boys
to
make
head
or
tail
of
our
indian
carts
and
harness
it
was
harder
for
them
to
put
a
pair
of
our
ponies
in
their
cart
than
their
own
span
of
ten
which
they
could
use
as
they
liked
after
receiving
orders
for
the
front
with
a
light
heart
every
man
thought
the
minutes
too
long
until
he
got
an
opportunity
of
distinguishing
himself
we
were
ordered
to
bloemfontein
and
everybody
was
on
the
at
once
we
railed
to
that
station
which
did
not
do
the
animals
any
good
and
on
arrival
there
were
ordered
to
join
a
brigade
at
farm
about
three
miles
beyond
the
town
having
to
draw
our
stores
from
bloemfontein
station
prepared
our
transport
and
drivers
for
the
work
which
lay
before
them
and
during
our
stay
there
they
got
in
excellent
order
the
first
day
our
transport
carts
went
out
with
spare
ammunition
for
the
corps
nothing
unusual
occurred
and
in
fact
all
returned
disappointed
but
this
showed
the
ammunition
drivers
what
they
must
expect
when
going
out
again
all
in
charge
of
these
carts
were
picked
men
being
the
best
drivers
with
the
best
animals
they
had
to
canter
and
trot
over
rough
country
with
eight
boxes
of
ammunition
to
keep
in
touch
with
their
corps
over
hills
or
otherwise
and
be
always
where
they
were
wanted
our
carts
were
very
handy
and
could
go
where
others
failed
next
day
was
the
ospruit
fight
and
the
carts
had
a
narrow
escape
then
the
enemy
got
their
range
and
the
played
round
them
for
some
time
a
few
of
the
shells
landing
between
the
carts
but
the
drivers
were
just
as
easy
as
ever
and
when
ordered
to
retire
did
it
in
excellent
style
smoking
and
passing
jokes
as
the
shells
followed
them
up
private
lowther
who
was
on
duty
that
day
will
not
forget
what
he
called
a
cool
order
when
the
drivers
were
getting
out
of
range
one
of
their
hats
was
blown
off
and
lowther
being
on
foot
was
ordered
to
pick
it
up
he
looked
twice
but
went
back
and
got
it
shells
were
a
bit
thick
but
he
remembered
he
was
a
soldier
the
day
after
the
fight
we
had
to
send
a
cart
out
to
bring
in
major
showers
corporal
cullen
and
private
arthurton
went
with
it
on
duty
cullen
corporal
in
charge
arthurton
the
driver
after
finding
the
body
they
were
joined
by
some
boers
who
assisted
to
put
the
major
in
the
cart
had
a
friendly
chat
with
them
passed
cigarettes
and
tobacco
round
and
cullen
said
when
he
came
back
to
camp
that
there
were
very
few
boers
among
them
nearly
all
and
of
a
very
respectable
class
they
had
very
little
to
say
regarding
the
fight
the
previous
day
but
said
they
were
sorry
our
colonel
was
killed
they
had
found
some
papers
in
the
pockets
of
young
lumsden
whom
they
took
to
be
the
colonel
we
had
most
trouble
with
our
carts
and
animals
when
night
marching
the
ponies
were
excellent
for
draught
purposes
the
cape
mules
did
not
last
nearly
as
well
if
properly
fed
the
ponies
would
have
worked
throughout
our
stay
in
africa
but
they
were
often
days
without
anything
but
what
they
could
pick
when
we
got
an
halt
on
one
occasion
which
i
remember
well
they
were
hours
under
harness
without
food
of
any
kind
and
only
watered
once
people
might
say
why
not
oftener
water
was
not
procurable
another
thing
that
came
against
us
was
the
cunning
kaffir
he
could
walk
around
at
night
take
the
best
of
our
animals
and
have
them
disfigured
in
such
a
way
that
nobody
could
recognise
them
the
following
morning
we
put
up
with
this
for
a
long
time
until
our
stock
of
spare
mules
ran
short
and
then
we
had
to
carry
out
the
same
tricks
as
the
remainder
by
doing
unto
others
as
they
had
done
to
us
we
were
able
to
take
to
pretoria
every
one
of
the
carts
with
which
we
left
bloemfontein
when
we
got
there
everything
of
course
was
the
worse
for
wear
but
complete
in
every
other
respect
if
anything
ever
frightened
our
transport
drivers
it
was
the
word
you
should
have
seen
their
worried
looks
when
they
heard
that
there
was
a
drift
ahead
but
they
braved
everything
thinking
that
pretoria
would
finish
all
but
to
our
surprise
when
we
got
there
we
found
out
that
the
show
was
only
then
starting
we
had
a
little
rest
after
the
surrender
being
sent
to
a
station
ten
miles
off
called
irene
while
there
the
transport
kept
the
horses
of
the
corps
well
fed
on
which
we
brought
from
all
the
farms
within
ten
miles
of
the
place
we
remained
at
irene
until
august
and
then
got
attached
to
a
brigade
going
after
de
wet
in
the
rustenburg
direction
we
were
on
this
march
for
days
without
rest
which
was
the
cause
of
killing
all
our
indian
ponies
except
twelve
the
whole
of
that
march
was
a
dead
pull
for
the
days
it
was
up
to
the
ankle
in
sand
while
next
it
was
just
the
same
in
black
sticky
earth
we
were
not
the
only
lot
that
suffered
every
unit
experienced
just
the
same
it
took
us
all
our
time
to
get
our
carts
back
to
pretoria
at
the
end
of
august
we
were
only
a
day
in
pretoria
before
being
ordered
off
again
on
the
march
to
barberton
things
had
to
be
got
ready
as
quickly
as
possible
and
off
we
went
on
september
for
another
long
trek
when
starting
on
this
march
we
had
to
leave
twelve
of
our
carts
in
pretoria
and
as
many
men
of
the
corps
had
come
down
we
reduced
our
transport
during
the
whole
of
this
period
we
had
very
little
time
for
carrying
out
repairs
to
carts
and
harness
the
saddles
began
to
give
out
in
the
leather
as
they
had
not
been
repaired
since
we
left
calcutta
except
a
stitch
here
and
there
during
our
stay
in
africa
we
never
had
an
animal
suffer
from
sore
back
this
we
think
was
due
to
the
excellent
way
in
which
the
saddles
were
stuffed
before
leaving
calcutta
although
newly
received
from
the
ordnance
department
they
did
not
satisfy
the
commissariat
and
transport
who
had
them
stuffed
to
his
own
liking
on
the
march
to
barberton
and
back
we
had
very
bad
weather
which
completely
destroyed
our
gear
and
arriving
at
pretoria
for
the
third
time
we
thought
of
getting
it
thoroughly
repaired
we
had
done
our
best
and
in
fact
had
all
the
saddles
restuffed
and
lined
in
a
very
short
time
when
orders
were
received
for
the
corps
to
be
disbanded
the
number
of
animals
with
which
we
left
india
mules
total
the
five
mules
lasted
throughout
but
only
eight
ponies
lived
to
see
the
finish
two
of
these
driven
by
private
arthurton
seemed
to
be
in
better
condition
at
the
finish
than
when
they
left
calcutta
he
took
great
care
of
his
animals
two
others
were
in
charge
of
driver
estabrooke
as
he
intended
remaining
in
south
africa
the
colonel
presented
him
with
his
pair
the
whole
of
the
carts
and
gear
were
handed
over
to
the
ordnance
pretoria
before
our
departure
with
three
hearty
cheers
from
muleteers
appendix

topical
song
by
henry
trooper
in

i
the
long
campaign
is
over
and
we
are
homeward
bound
we
think
about
waiting
us
on
shore
of
the
dâks
at
country
stations
of
the
evenings
in
the
club
and
the
pleasures
of
a
civy
rig
once
more
chorus
for
the
ration
jam
is
sweet
and
the
beef
is
good
and
is
nothing
short
of

but
give

yes
oh
give
me
oh
how
i
wish
you
would
cutlets
and
my
peg
at
evening
time
ii
we
have
often
groused
and
grumbled
but
not
a
man
would
say
sorry
that
he
joined
the
good
old
corps
and
the
longest
marches
seem
now
but
fair
share
of
work
and
play
when
we
know
not
to
do
them
any
more
chorus
iii
it
really
is
annoying
when
you
march
at
break
of
day
to
find
your
moke
has
vanished
from
the
line
and
you
curse
the
stable
picket
and
on
your
knees
you
pray
you
may
never
see
another
chorus
iv
very
near
the
finish
and
in
a
week
or
so
we
will
scatter
over
india
hill
and

when
two
of
us
foregather
the
clouds
of

we
