chapter

introductory
before
entering
on
the
question
of
the
relation
of
morality
to
our
existing
social
environment
it
will
be
advisable
to
inquire
what
we
mean
by
moral
progress
and
what
evidence
there
is
that
any
such
progress
has
occurred
in
recent
times
or
even
within
the
period
of
history
by
morals
we
mean
right
conduct
not
only
in
our
immediate
social
relations
but
also
in
our
dealings
with
our
fellow
citizens
and
with
the
whole
human
race
it
is
based
upon
the
possession
of
clear
ideals
as
to
what
actions
are
right
and
what
are
wrong
and
the
determination
of
our
conduct
by
a
constant
reference
to
those
ideals
the
belief
was
once
prevalent
and
is
still
held
by
many
persons
that
a
knowledge
of
right
and
wrong
is
inherent
or
instinctive
in
everyone
and
that
the
immoral
person
may
be
justly
punished
for
such
wrongdoing
as
he
commits
but
that
this
can
not
be
wholly
if
at
all
true
is
shown
by
the
fact
that
in
different
societies
and
at
different
periods
the
standard
of
right
and
wrong
changes
considerably
that
which
at
one
time
and
place
is
held
to
be
right
and
proper
is
at
another
time
or
place
considered
to
be
not
only
wrong
but
one
of
the
greatest
of
crimes
the
most
striking
example
of
this
change
of
opinion
is
that
as
to
slavery
which
was
held
to
be
quite
justifiable
by
the
most
highly
civilised
people
of
antiquity
and
hardly
less
so
by
ourselves
within
the
memory
of
persons
still
living
the
owners
of
sugar
estates
in
jamaica
cultivated
by
slaves
were
not
stigmatised
as
immoral
by
their
relatives
in
england
or
by
the
public
at
large
and
it
was
the
horror
excited
by
the
in
africa
and
in
the
middle
passage
on
the
slave
ships
rather
than
by
the
slavery
itself
that
so
excited
public
opinion
as
to
lead
to
the
abolition
first
of
the
one
and
then
of
the
other
we
are
obliged
to
conclude
therefore
that
what
is
commonly
termed
morality
is
not
wholly
due
to
any
inherent
perception
of
what
is
right
or
wrong
conduct
but
that
it
is
to
some
extent
and
often
very
largely
a
matter
of
convention
varying
at
different
times
and
places
in
accordance
with
the
degree
and
kind
of
social
development
which
has
been
attained
often
under
different
and
even
divergent
conditions
of
existence
the
actual
morality
of
a
community
is
largely
a
product
of
the
environment
but
it
is
local
and
temporary
not
permanently
affecting
the
character
to
bring
together
the
evidence
in
support
of
this
view
to
distinguish
between
what
is
permanent
and
inherited
and
what
is
superficial
and
not
inherited
and
to
trace
out
some
of
the
consequences
as
regards
what
we
term
morality
is
the
purpose
of
the
present
volume
chapter
ii
morality
as
based
upon
character
though
much
of
what
we
term
morality
has
no
absolute
sanction
in
human
nature
yet
it
is
to
some
extent
and
perhaps
very
largely
based
upon
it
it
will
be
well
therefore
to
consider
briefly
the
nature
and
probable
origin
of
what
we
term
character
individuals
in
societies
and
especially
in
those
more
ancient
and
more
fundamental
divisions
of
mankind
which
we
term
races
character
may
be
defined
as
the
aggregate
of
mental
faculties
and
emotions
which
constitute
personal
or
national
individuality
it
is
very
strongly
hereditary
yet
it
is
probably
subject
to
more
inherent
variation
than
is
the
form
and
structure
of
the
body
the
combinations
of
its
constituent
elements
are
so
numerous
as
in
common
language
to
be
termed
infinite
and
this
gives
to
each
person
a
very
distinct
individuality
as
manifested
in
speech
in
emotional
expression
and
in
action
the
mental
faculties
which
go
to
form
the
character
of
each
man
or
woman
are
very
numerous
a
large
proportion
of
them
being
such
as
are
required
for
the
preservation
of
the
individual
and
of
the
race
while
others
are
social
or
ethical
these
latter
which
impel
us
to
truth
to
justice
and
to
benevolence
when
in
due
proportion
to
all
the
other
mental
faculties
go
to
form
what
we
distinguish
as
a
good
or
moral
character
and
will
in
most
cases
result
in
actions
which
meet
with
the
general
approval
of
that
section
of
society
in
which
we
live
and
this
approval
reacts
upon
the
character
so
that
it
often
appears
to
be
better
than
it
really
is
so
great
is
the
effect
of
this
approval
of
our
fellows
that
it
sometimes
leads
to
behaviour
quite
different
from
what
it
would
be
if
this
approval
were
absent
this
is
especially
the
case
when
the
approval
leads
to
wealth
or
positions
of
dignity
or
advantage
occasionally
in
cases
of
this
kind
the
individual
can
not
resist
his
natural
impulses
and
then
acts
so
as
to
show
his
underlying
real
character
we
term
such
persons
hypocrites
for
making
us
believe
that
they
were
inherently
good
instead
of
being
so
in
appearance
only
when
the
good
action
was
profitable
to
them
hence
in
a
highly
complex
state
of
civilisation
it
becomes
exceedingly
difficult
correctly
to
appraise
characters
as
moral
or
immoral
good
or
bad
while
there
is
no
such
difficulty
as
regards
the
intellectual
and
emotional
aspects
of
character
which
are
less
influenced
by
the
general
environment
and
which
there
is
less
temptation
to
conceal
all
the
evidence
we
possess
tends
to
show
that
although
the
actions
of
most
individuals
are
to
a
considerable
extent
determined
by
their
social
environment
that
does
not
imply
any
alteration
in
their
character
everyone
experience
of
life
and
especially
the
example
of
his
friends
and
associates
leads
him
to
repress
his
passions
regulate
his
emotions
and
in
general
to
use
his
judgment
before
acting
so
as
to
secure
the
esteem
of
his
fellows
and
greater
happiness
for
himself
and
these
restraints
becoming
habitual
may
often
give
the
appearance
of
an
actual
change
of
character
till
some
great
temptation
or
violent
passion
overcomes
the
usual
restraint
and
exhibits
the
real
nature
which
is
usually
dormant
now
it
is
this
inherent
and
unchangeable
character
itself
that
tends
to
be
transmitted
to
offspring
and
this
being
the
case
there
can
be
no
progressive
improvement
in
character
without
some
selective
agency
tending
to
such
improvement
by
means
of
a
general
discussion
of
the
nature
and
origin
of
character
i
have
elsewhere
shown
that
there
is
no
proof
of
any
real
advance
in
it
during
the
whole
historical
period
a
i
show
later
on
what
the
required
selective
agency
is
and
how
it
will
come
into
action
automatically
when
and
not
until
our
social
system
is
so
reformed
as
to
afford
suitable
conditions

permanence
of
character
i
will
now
call
attention
to
a
few
of
the
facts
which
lead
to
the
conclusion
as
to
the
stationary
condition
of
general
character
from
the
earliest
periods
of
human
history
and
presumably
from
the
dawn
of
civilisation
in
the
earliest
records
which
have
come
down
to
us
from
the
past
we
find
ample
indications
that
general
ethical
conceptions
the
accepted
standard
of
morality
and
the
conduct
resulting
from
these
were
in
no
degree
inferior
to
those
which
prevail
though
in
some
respects
they
differed
from
ours
as
examples
of
great
moral
teachers
in
very
early
times
we
have
socrates
and
plato
about
confucius
and
buddha
one
or
two
centuries
earlier
homer
earlier
still
the
great
indian
epic
the
about
all
these
afford
indications
of
intellectual
and
moral
character
quite
equal
to
our
own
while
their
lower
manifestations
as
shown
by
their
wars
and
love
of
gambling
were
no
worse
than
corresponding
immoralities
in
the
beautiful
translation
by
the
late
romesh
dutt
of
such
portions
of
the
as
are
best
fitted
to
give
english
readers
a
proper
conception
of
the
whole
work
there
is
a
striking
episode
entitled
woman
love
in
which
the
heroine
a
princess
by
repeated
petitions
and
reasonings
persuades
yama
the
god
of
death
to
give
back
her
husband
spirit
to
the
body
it
is
described
in
the
following
verses
and
the
sable
king
was
vanquished
and
he
turned
on
her
again
and
his
words
fell

not

that
his

shall

and
your

troth
endureth
longer
than
the
fleeting
breath
and
a
woman
love
abideth
higher
than
the
doom
of
death
and
when
at
the
end
of
the
epic
the
kings
and
warriors
welcome
each
other
in
the
spirit
world
we
find
the
following
noble
conception
of
the
qualities
and
actions
which
give
them
a
place
there
these
and
other
mighty
warriors
in
the
earthly
battle

their
valour
and
their
virtue

bright

dutt
informs
us
that
he
has
not
only
reproduced
as
nearly
as
possible
the
metre
of
the
original
but
has
aimed
at
giving
us
a
literal
translation
no
one
can
read
his
beautiful
rendering
without
feeling
that
the
people
it
describes
were
our
intellectual
and
moral
equals
the
wonderful
collection
of
hymns
known
as
the
vedas
is
a
vast
system
of
religious
teaching
as
pure
and
lofty
as
those
of
the
finest
portions
of
the
hebrew
scriptures
a
few
examples
from
the
translation
by
sir
monier
will
show
that
its
various
writers
were
fully
our
equals
in
their
conceptions
of
the
universe
and
of
the
deity
expressed
in
the
finest
poetic
language
the
following
is
a
portion
of
a
hymn
to
the
investing
sky
the
mighty
varuna
who
rules
above
looks
down
upon
these
worlds
his
kingdom
as
if
close
at
hand
when
men
imagine
they
do
aught
by
stealth
he
knows
it
no
one
can
stand
or
walk
or
softly
glide
along
or
hide
in
dark
recess
or
lurk
in
secret
cell
but
varuna
detects
him
and
his
movements
spies
this
boundless
earth
is
his
his
the
vast
sky
whose
depth
no
mortal
can
fathom
both
oceans
find
a
place
within
his
body
yet
in
the
small
pool
he
lies
contained
should
flee
far
far
beyond
the
sky
would
not
escape
the
grasp
of
varuna
the
king
his
messengers
descend
countless
from
his
ever
traversing
this
world
and
scanning
with
a
thousand
eyes
its
inmates

varuna
perceives
may
thy
destroying
snares
cast
sevenfold
round
the
wicked
entangle

but
the
truthful
spare
o
king
the
following
passage
from
a
hymn
to
death
shows
a
perfect
confidence
in
that
persistence
of
the
human
personality
after
death
which
is
still
a
matter
of
doubt
and
discussion
to
yama

no

of

thus
won
by
thee
o
king
we
come
the

die
must
tread

path
that
thou

by
which
each
race
of

in
long
succession

too
have

thy

who
dwell
in

with

return
unto
thy

o
soul
thy
sin
and
shame
leave
thou
behind
on
earth
assume
a
shining
thy
ancient
and
from
all
taint
set
free
in
this
we
find
many
of
the
essential
teachings
of
the
most
advanced
religious
immediate
entrance
to
a
higher
life
the
recognition
of
friends
the
persistence
of
the
human
form
and
the
shining
raiment
typical
of
the
loss
of
earthly
taint
but
besides
these
special
deities
we
find
also
the
recognition
of
the
one
supreme
god
as
in
the
following
hymn
what
god
shall
we
adore
with
sacrifice
him
let
us
praise
the
golden
child
that
rose
in
the
beginning
who
was
born
the
the
one
sole
lord
of
all
that
made
the
earth
and
formed
the
sky
who
giveth
life
who
giveth
strength
whose
bidding
gods
revere
whose
hiding
place
is
immortality
whose
shadow
death
who
by
his
might
is
king
of
all
the
breathing
sleeping
waking
who
governs
men
and
beasts
whose
majesty
these
snowy
hills
this
ocean
with
its
rivers
declare
of
whom
these
spreading
regions
form
the
arms
by
which
the
firmament
is
strong
earth
firmly
planted
and
the
highest
heavens
supported
and
the
clouds
that
fill
the
air
distributed
and
measured
out
to
whom
both
earth
and
heaven
established
by
his
will
look
up
with
trembling
mind
in
whom
revealed
the
rising
sun
shines
forth
above
the
world
if
we
make
allowance
for
the
very
limited
knowledge
of
nature
at
this
early
period
we
must
admit
that
the
mind
which
conceived
and
expressed
in
appropriate
language
such
ideas
as
are
everywhere
apparent
in
these
vedic
hymns
could
not
have
been
in
any
way
inferior
to
those
of
the
best
of
our
religious
teachers

permanence
of
high
intellect
accompanying
this
fine
literature
and
moral
teaching
in
ancient
india
was
a
civilisation
equal
to
that
of
early
classical
races
in
grand
temples
forts
and
palaces
weapons
and
implements
jewelry
and
exquisite
fabrics
their
architecture
was
highly
decorative
and
peculiar
and
has
continued
to
quite
recent
times
owing
perhaps
to
the
tropical
or
climate
with
marked
wet
and
dry
seasons
the
oldest
buildings
that
have
survived
even
as
ruins
are
less
ancient
than
those
of
greece
or
those
corresponding
in
age
to
the
period
of
our
gothic
cathedrals
are
immensely
numerous

show
an
originality
of
design
a
wealth
of
ornament
and
a
perfection
of
workmanship
equal
to
those
of
any
other
buildings
in
the
world
two
other
great
civilisations
of
which
we
have
authentic
records
are
those
of
egypt
and
mesopotamia
both
of
which
appear
to
have
been
much
older
than
those
of
india

greece

whereas
egypt
has
left
us
the
most
continuous

ancient
cities
of
nineveh
and
babylon
from
which
have
been
disinterred
many
fine
statues
and
reliefs
exhibiting
a
very
distinct
style
of
art
for
more
than
years
the
history
and
remains
of
this
once
greatest
of
civilisations
was
absolutely
unknown
except
by
a
few
doubtful
facts
and
names
in
greek
and
hebrew
writings
but
during
the
latter
half
of
the
nineteenth
century
a
band
of
explorers
and
students
such
as
layard
and
rawlinson
made
known
first
the
works
of
art
and
latterly
an
enormous
quantity
of
small
bricks
and
stone
slabs
thickly
covered
with
a
peculiar
kind
of
writing
known
as
the
cuneiform
inscriptions
which
after
an
enormous
amount
of
labour
have
at
length
been
translated
whole
libraries
of
these
have
been
discovered
and
as
the
reading
and
translating
goes
on
we
obtain
a
knowledge
of
the
history
laws
customs
and
daily
life
of
this
ancient
people
almost
equal
to
that
we
now
possess
of
the
ancient
indians
and
egyptians
for
our
present
purpose
however
egyptian
civilisation
is
the
most
important
because
it
presents
us
with
the
most
definite
proof
of
the
attainment
of
a
high
degree
of
what
is
specially
scientific
attainment
at
the
very
dawn
of
historical
knowledge
this
is
well
exhibited
by
that
most
wonderful
work
of
constructive
great
pyramid
of
though
not
quite
the
earliest
is
the
largest
and
most
remarkable
of
about
seventy
pyramids
in
various
parts
of
egypt
and
has
been
more
thoroughly
explored
and
studied
both
as
to
its
proportions
construction
and
uses
than
any
of
the
others
this
pyramid
is
known
historically
to
have
been
built
by
the
order
of
king
cheops
or
khufu
and
the
date
of
its
design
and
erection
can
be
pretty
accurately
fixed
as
about
or
nearly
years
earlier
than
that
of
the
civilisation
depicted
in
the
indian
and
greek
epics
the
internal
structure
of
this
pyramid
is
its
most
interesting
feature
because
it
shows
clearly
that
it
was
designed
to
be
not
only
the
tomb
of
the
king
who
built
it
but
also
a
true
astronomical
observatory
during
his
life
this
has
been
denied
by
some
modern
historians
in
harmsworth
of
the
it
is
said
for
the
pyramids
are
nothing
but
tombs
they
have
no
astronomical
meaning
or
intention
whatever
and
then
after
referring
to
the
ideas
of
piazzi
smyth
and
others
as
vain
imaginings
it
is
added
there
is
nothing
marvellous
about
these
great
tombs
except
their
size
and
the
accuracy
of
their
building
an
almost
exactly
similar
statement
is
made
in
the
great
history
of
the
and
in
chambers
encyclopædia
if
the
writers
of
these
histories
had
read
proctor
book
great
pyramid
observatory
tomb
and
they
would
have
known
that
this
statement
is
entirely
erroneous
the
size
shape
and
angles
of
the
internal
passages
have
been
described
and
measured
by
many
competent
students
among
the
most
careful
and
exact
of
whom
was
piazzi
smyth
then
astronomer
royal
of
scotland
it
is
true
he
had
many
vain
imaginings
but
his
measurements
were
among
the
most
trustworthy
the
pyramid
religion
which
he
helped
to
establish
by
a
series
of
coincidences
in
the
dimensions
of
various
parts
of
the
pyramid
with
astronomical
dimensions
of
which
the
pyramid
builders
could
have
had
no
knowledge
whatever
such
as
the
distance
of
the
sun
the
precession
of
the
equinoxes
etc
was
no
doubt
a
vain
imagining
but
he
frankly
claimed
it
as
a
divine
inspiration
all
these
are
rejected
by
proctor
who
clearly
explains
the
purpose
of
the
greater
part
of
the
internal
structure
as
only
an
experienced
practical
astronomer
could
do
i
will
now
state
as
briefly
as
possible
what
are
the
facts
as
well
as
the
conclusions
at
which
proctor
arrives
the
great
pyramid
and
the
two
smaller
ones
near
it
forming
the
pyramids
of
gizeh
are
placed
on
a
small
rocky
plateau
near
the
apex
of
the
delta
of
the
nile
the
largest
of
these
is
situated
so
that
its
northern
face
rises
from
the
very
edge
of
this
plateau
the
reason
of
this
seems
to
have
been
that
the
builders
wished
to
place
it
as
nearly
as
possible
on
the
parallel
of
latitude
it
is
really
about
a
mile
and
a
third
south
of
that
parallel
and
it
is
shown
that
such
an
error
is
a
small
one
for
that
early
period
and
would
matter
but
very
little
for
the
purpose
required
the
next
feature
is
that
it
is
truly
oriented
that
is
the
four
sides
run
north
and
south
east
and
west
it
is
also
a
true
square
the
four
sides
being
of
equal
length
and
the
four
corners
are
on
a
truly
level
plane
the
first
thing
the
builders
had
to
do
was
to
get
a
true
meridian
line
and
they
could
have
done
this
in
two
observations
of
the
sun
or
of
the
pole
star
the
latter
being
much
the
more
accurate
though
more
laborious
and
costly
at
the
time
the
pyramid
was
built
the
pole
star
was
alpha
draconis
which
was
farther
from
the
pole
than
our
pole
star
and
revolved
around
the
true
pole
in
a
circle
of
in
diameter
in
order
to
observe
the
direction
of
this
star
at
its
lowest
point
the
builders
excavated
in
the
solid
rock
a
tunnel
about
feet
in
diameter
so
as
to
keep
this
star
visible
each
day
at
the
lowest
point
of
its
circuit
this
tunnel
extended
feet
through
the
rock
to
a
point
nearly
under
the
centre
of
the
pyramid
where
by
a
small
vertical
boring
a
could
have
been
dropped
so
as
to
obtain
the
exact
line
of
the
meridian
on
the
surface
and
afterwards
on
each
successive
step
of
the
pyramid
as
it
was
built
up
while
the
building
went
on
the
sloping
tunnel
was
continued
backwards
to
its
northern
face
and
a
tunnel
ascending
to
the
south
was
formed
of
the
same
size
and
making
the
same
angle
with
the
horizon
this
had
puzzled
all
previous
explorers
of
the
pyramid
till
proctor
showed
that
by
stopping
up
the
downward
passage
at
the
angle
and
filling
the
hollow
with
water
the
pole
star
could
be
observed
by
reflexion
and
thus
give
the
exact
direction
of
the
meridian
on
the
upper
surface
of
the
pyramid
with
extreme
accuracy
as
it
was
built
up
slowly
year
by
year
but
at
a
distance
of
feet
a
new
feature
appears
the
ascending
tunnel
is
changed
into
what
is
called
the
great
gallery
which
while
continuing
exactly
the
same
floor
line
as
the
tunnel
is
suddenly
raised
to
a
height
of
feet
with
a
width
of
feet
on
the
floor
and
feet
at
the
top
along
each
side
there
is
a
ledge
or
seat
inches
broad
and
inches
high
the
sides
do
not
slope
inwards
but
are
formed
of
seven
courses
of
stone
each
one
overlapping
the
one
below
by
about
inches
the
whole
of
this
gallery
or
inclined
corridor
is
formed
of
limestone
beautifully
smooth
or
even
polished
the
length
of
this
gallery
is
feet
and
its
floor
terminated
at
the
platform
of
the
pyramid
upon
the
central
line
from
east
to
west
when
it
had
reached
of
its
total
height
this
is
on
the
level
of
the
king
chamber
and
it
was
probably
only
after
the
king
was
dead
and
his
body
embalmed
and
placed
in
his
sarcophagus
that
the
pyramid
was
completed
the
openings
of
the
passages
carefully
closed
up
and
the
whole
exterior
covered
with
a
smooth
casing
of
stone
very
small
portions
of
which
now
remain
there
are
two
other
features
of
this
gallery
which
have
puzzled
the
merely
antiquarian
explorers
these
are
square
holes
cut
in
the
sloping
benches
close
to
the
side
walls
and
about
feet
apart
there
being
eighteen
on
each
side
exactly
opposite
each
other
on
each
side
of
the
gallery
about
up
is
a
longitudinal
groove
which
would
serve
to
carry
transverse
screens
which
could
be
slid
up
or
down
and
easily
wedged
in
position
in
order
to
mark
exactly
the
central
line
like
the
cross
hairs
in
an
astronomical
telescope
the
holes
on
the
benches
would
serve
to
carry
cross
seats
on
which
the
observer
could
be
firmly
and
comfortably
seated
while
observing
a
transit
of
sun
star
or
planet
being
open
to
the
south
the
great
gallery
would
give
a
magnificent
view
of
the
southern
sky
and
enable
observers
to
determine
the
altitudes
and
azimuths
of
many
stars
and
of
the
superior
planets
mars
jupiter
and
saturn
the
star
alpha
centauri
which
was
at
that
period
of
the
first
magnitude
though
now
much
diminished
in
brightness
would
when
crossing
the
meridian
have
been
situated
about
the
centre
of
the
field
of
view
as
seen
from
this
remarkable
feature
of
the
pyramid
which
proctor
considers
was
the
finest
ever
constructed
for
observations
tycho
brahé
with
his
celebrated
quadrant
at
uranienburg
did
not
attain
such
a
degree
of
accuracy
as
did
these
eastern
astronomers
nearly
years
ago
one
great
superiority
of
the
subterranean
observatory
over
any
observations
that
can
be
made
without
telescopes
is
that
by
closing
up
the
end
except
for
the
small
aperture
required
to
see
the
object
the
brighter
stars
could
be
well
observed
in
the
daytime
when
we
remember
that
the
great
pyramid
covers
acres
of
ground
that
it
is
truly
square
and
on
a
truly
horizontal
base
that
each
side
is
accurately
directed
to
a
point
of
the
compass
that
the
angle
of
its
slope
is
such
that
the
area
of
each
of
the
four
triangular
faces
is
equal
to
that
of
a
square
whose
sides
are
equal
to
the
height
of
the
pyramid
and
further
that
the
slope
of
the
long
descending
tunnel
is
precisely
such
as
to
point
accurately
to
the
pole
star
of
the
epoch
at
the
lowest
part
of
its
circuit
round
the
true
pole
and
lastly
that
all
this
could
only
be
done
as
accurately
as
it
has
been
done
by
the
system
of
subterranean
tunnels
and
galleries
that
actually
exists
while
almost
all
the
details
of
their
construction
are
shown
to
be
adapted
for
astronomical
observations
of
the
nature
required
the
conclusion
becomes
irresistible
that
they
were
designed
and
used
for
such
observations
and
that
by
no
other
means
could
the
same
amount
of
accuracy
have
been
attained
i
have
given
a
rather
full
account
of
what
the
pyramid
builders
really
did
because
it
forms
a
very
important
part
of
the
argument
i
am
developing
as
to
the
stationary
condition
of
the
human
intellect
during
the
historical
period
the
great
majority
of
educated
persons
hold
the
opinion
that
our
wonderful
discoveries
and
inventions
in
every
department
of
art
and
science
prove
that
we
are
really
more
intellectual
and
wiser
than
the
men
of
past
our
mental
faculties
have
increased
in
power
but
this
idea
is
totally
unfounded
we
are
the
inheritors
of
the
accumulated
knowledge
of
all
the
ages
and
it
is
quite
possible
and
even
probable
that
the
earliest
steps
taken
in
the
accumulation
of
this
vast
mental
treasury
required
even
more
thought
and
a
higher
intellectual
power
than
any
of
those
taken
in
our
own
era
we
can
perhaps
best
understand
this
by
supposing
any
one
of
our
great
men
of
science
to
have
been
born
and
educated
in
one
of
the
earliest
of
the
civilisations
if
newton
had
been
born
in
egypt
in
the
era
of
the
pyramid
builders
when
there
were
no
such
sciences
as
mathematics
perhaps
even
no
decimal
notation
which
makes
arithmetic
so
easy
to
us
he
could
probably
have
done
nothing
more
than
they
have
actually
done
in
building
up
the
sciences
each
of
the
early
steps
was
the
work
of
a
genius
but
now
that
there
has
been
nearly
a
hundred
centuries
of
discovery
and
specialisation
by
thousands
or
even
millions
of
workers
that
by
means
of
writing
and
of
the
printing
press
every
discovery
is
quickly
made
known
and
that
ever
larger
and
larger
numbers
devote
their
lives
to
study
the
rate
of
progress
becomes
quicker
and
quicker
till
the
total
result
is
amazingly
great
but
that
does
not
prove
any
superiority
of
the
later
over
the
earlier
discoveries
there
is
therefore
no
proof
of
continuously
increasing
intellectual
power
but
we
have
now
evidence
of
another
kind
which
adds
to
the
force
of
this
argument
quite
recently
papyri
have
been
discovered
which
give
us
information
as
to
the
ideas
the
beliefs
and
the
aspirations
of
a
period
even
earlier
than
that
of
the
great
pyramid
the
result
of
the
study
of
these
and
other
records
of
early
egypt
is
thus
stated
by
professor
adolf
erman
in
historian
history
of
the
but
when
one
considers
the
ancient
resident
of
the
valley
of
the
nile
as
a
human
being
with
desires
emotions
and
aspirations
almost
precisely
like
our
own
a
man
struggling
to
solve
the
same
problems
of
practical
socialism
that
we
are
struggling
for
and
then
only
can
the
lessons
of
ancient
egyptian
history
be
brought
home
to
us
in
their
true
meaning
and
with
their
true
significance
and
clearest
of
all
will
that
significance
be
perhaps
if
we
constantly
bear
in
mind
the
possibility
that
the
whole
sweep
of
egyptian
history
during
the
three
or
four
thousand
years
that
separated
the
pyramid
builders
from
the
contemporaries
of
alexander
was
a
time
of
national
dark
age
if
you
egyptian
history
that
a
great
historian
from
a
study
of
the
ideas
and
social
aspirations
of
the
earliest
known
civilisations
should
have
arrived
at
similar
views
as
to
the
identity
of
their
mental
capacity
with
our
own
as
i
have
deduced
from
their
scientific
attainments
must
be
held
to
be
a
very
strong
argument
in
support
of
the
accuracy
of
our
independent
conclusions
chapter
v
speech
and
writing
as
proofs
of
intelligence
there
is
yet
another
proof
that
the
faculties
of
mankind
at
a
very
early
epoch
were
fully
equal
to
those
of
our
own
time
there
is
perhaps
nothing
more
difficult
in
its
nature
more
utterly
beyond
the
mere
lower
animal
than
the
faculty
of
articulate
speech
possessed
by
every
race
of
mankind
we
can
not
but
believe
that
its
acquisition
was
an
extremely
slow
process
and
that
it
is
rendered
possible
by
special
cerebral
developments
giving
the
necessary
mental
power
for
its
acquirement
how
long
a
process
this
would
be
it
is
impossible
to
say
but
it
would
certainly
have
had
to
reach
a
high
degree
of
perfection
before
the
equally
difficult
process
of
inventing
a
mode
of
writing
could
have
been
brought
to
such
perfection
as
to
facilitate
the
further
development
of
the
higher
faculties
through
poetry
on
the
one
hand
and
the
preservation
of
facts
and
discoveries
as
well
as
trains
of
reasoning
on
the
other
now
i
wish
to
call
attention
to
the
very
important
fact
that
the
origin
and
development
of
speech
and
later
of
writing
were
apparently
almost
simultaneous
and
certainly
quite
independent
of
each
other
in
countries
not
very
distant
apart
this
is
shown
by
the
radical
diversity
of
the
different
groups
of
languages
in
europe
eastern
asia
and
north
africa
and
the
equal
diversity
of
egyptian
assyrian
and
chinese
writing
all
other
written
characters
are
believed
to
be
derived
from
one
or
other
of
these
and
it
is
known
that
the
forms
and
peculiarities
of
alphabetic
characters
have
been
greatly
modified
by
the
various
materials
employed
such
as
wood
and
stone
slabs
clay
or
wax
papyrus
paper
or
parchment
and
whether
engraved
impressed
or
painted
whether
written
with
a
reed
or
quill
pen
or
with
a
small
brush
but
if
intellectual
man
as
a
species
of
mammal
had
developed
by
the
preservation
of
variations
of
we
should
expect
to
find
such
an
important
faculty
as
speech
to
have
originated
in
one
centre
and
to
have
spread
rapidly
over
the
world
with
only
slight
modifications
in
isolated
communities
the
fundamental
diversities
we
find
seem
to
accord
better
with
the
conception
that
when
as
a
mere
animal
his
material
organism
had
reached
the
required
degree
of
perfection
there
occurred
the
spiritual
influx
which
alone
enabled
him
to
begin
that
course
of
intellectual
and
moral
development
and
that
marvellous
power
over
the
forces
of
nature
in
which
speech
and
writing
followed
by
printing
have
been
such
important
factors
in
order
for
man
to
develop
speech
he
must

believe
that

savages
not
morally
inferior
to
civilised
races
if
the
facts
and
arguments
set
forth
in
the
preceding
chapters
are
correct
we
should
not
expect
to
find
any
living
examples
of
the
unspiritualised
man
since
the
assumption
is
that
the
whole
race
received
the
influx
which
started
them
on
their
course
of
purely
human
development
within
a
strictly
limited
period
perhaps
of
a
very
few
generations
or
even
one
generation
the
ancestral
supposed
missing
then
have
become
extinct
if
this
were
not
so
we
should
expect
to
find
some
isolated
groups
of
speechless
man
and
of
this
there
is
no
example
but
on
the
contrary
the
very
lowest
of
existing
races
are
found
to
possess
languages
which
are
often
of
extreme
complexity
in
grammatical
structure
and
in
no
way
suggestive
of
the
primitive
of
which
they
are
supposed
to
be
surviving
relics
so
long
as
we
got
our
knowledge
respecting
them
from
the
europeans
who
captured
them
for
slaves
or
shot
them
down
as
wild
beasts
we
could
not
possibly
acquire
any
real
knowledge
of
them
as
human
beings
but
now
that
we
have
more
trustworthy
accounts
of
them
by
intelligent
travellers
or
missionaries
we
find
ample
evidence
that
when
by
kindness
and
sympathy
we
penetrate
to
their
inner
nature
we
discover
that
they
possess
human
qualities
of
the
same
kind
as
our
own
a
few
examples
of
what
unprejudiced
witnesses
say
of
them
will
be
very
instructive

on

the
natives
of
the
friendly
isles
as
being
liberal
brave
open
and
candid
without
either
suspicion
or
treachery
cruelty
or
revenge
and
a
century
later
admiral
erskine
remarks
that
they
carry
their
habits
of
cleanliness
and
decency
to
a
higher
point
than
the
most
civilised
nations
while
all
the
polynesian
races
are
kind
and
attentive
to
the
sick
and
aged
and
unlimited
hospitality
is
everywhere
practised
by
them
even
the
australian
aborigines
who
are
often
said
to
be
one
of
the
lowest
of
human
races
are
found
to
possess
many
good
qualities
by
those
who
know
them

the
extreme
grief
they
manifest
at

illustrated
by
the
native
boy
who
was
the
sole
companion
of
the
unfortunate
kennedy
when
he
was
murdered
are
sufficient
to
indicate
that
they
possess
affections
and
a
sense
of
right
and
wrong
not
very
different
from
our
own
the
fact
that
the
physical
characteristics
of
the
australians
are
substantially
those
of
the
caucasian
race
in
its
lowest
types
has
led
me
to
conclude
that
these
interesting
people
may
have
been
descended
from
much
more
civilised
remote
ancestors
and
are
thus
an
example
of
degradation
rather
than
of
survival
a
a
see

and

chap

australian
aborigines
where
this
view
was
first
set
forth

cases
of

see
my
selection
and
tropical
pp
many
other
illustrations
of
both
intelligence
and
morality
are
met
with
among
savage
races
in
all
parts
of
the
world
and
these
taken
as
a
whole
show
a
substantial
identity
of
human
character
both
moral
and
emotional
with
no
marked
superiority
in
any
race
or
country
in
intellect
where
the
greatest
advance
is
supposed
to
have
occurred
this
may
be
wholly
due
to
the
cumulative
effect
of
successive
acquisitions
of
knowledge
handed
down
from
age
to
age
euclid

probably
the
equals
of
any
of

greatest
mathematicians
of
while
the
architecture
of
greece
of

and
of
central
america
is
little
inferior
to
mediæval
gothic
but
none
of
these
though
so
different
in
style
can
be
said
to
prove
any
real
advance
in
intellectual
power
from
that
of
the
builders
of
the
much
more
ancient
temples
and
pyramids
of
egypt
this
latter
country
too
in
its
high
material
civilisation
and
its
remarkable
religious
system
shows
itself
the
equal
of
any
that
has
succeeded
it
chapter
vii
a
selective
agency
needed
to
improve
character
the
general
result
of
the
facts
and
arguments
now
set
forth
in
the
merest
outline
leads
us
to
conclude
that
there
has
been
no
definite
advance
of
morality
from
age
to
age
and
that
even
the
lowest
races
at
each
period
possessed
the
same
intellectual
and
moral
nature
as
the
higher
the
manifestations
of
this
essentially
human
nature
in
habits
and
conduct
were
often
very
diverse
in
accordance
with
diversities
of
the
social
and
moral
environment
this
is
quite
in
accordance
with
the
now
doctrine
that
the
essential
character
of
man
intellectual
emotional
and
moral
is
inherent
in
him
from
birth
that
it
is
subject
to
great
variation
from
individual
to
individual
and
that
its
manifestations
in
conduct
can
be
modified
in
a
very
high
degree
by
the
influence
of
public
opinion
and
systematic
teaching
these
latter
changes
however
are
hereditary
and
it
follows
that
no
definite
advance
in
morals
can
occur
in
any
race
there
is
some
selective
or
segregative
agency
at
as
there
is
a
great
amount
of
misconception
on
this
subject
some
explanation
may
be
advisable
many
and
intelligent
persons
seem
to
think
that
whatever
characters
or
faculties
are
hereditary
are
also
necessarily
cumulative
they
hear
that
mental
as
well
as
physical
characteristics
are
hereditary
their
own
observation
tells
them
that
there
are
musical
families
as
well
as
tall
families
they
hear
that
the
late
sir
francis
galton
wrote
a
book
on
and
perhaps
they
have
read
it
but
they
do
not
observe
that
neither
he
nor
anyone
else
has
proved
that
genius
of
any
kind
is
cumulative
that
is
that
a
man
or
woman
of
genius
will
have
on
the
average
some
one
or
more
children
with
a
greater
amount
of
that
special
power
or
faculty
than
their
own
the
very
contrary
of
this
is
really
the
case
the
more
a
person
talent
or
mental
power
is
above
the
average
the
less
chance
there
is
that
any
of
his
or
her
children
will
have
still
more
of
that
power
than
he
has
a
really
great
poet
or
painter
or
musician
appears
suddenly
in
a
family
of
mediocre
ability
or
of
no
ability
at
all
in
that
special
direction
a
few
examples
may
be
instructive
sir
william
herschell
was
the
son
of
a
german
musician
and
was
himself
a
musician
by
profession
but
he
became
an
astronomical
genius
one
of
the
greatest
of
his
age
his
son
sir
john
herschell
was
a
very
clever
man
with
advantages
of
education
and
position
he
followed
his
father
as
an
astronomer
and
was
a
great
mathematician
but
is
never
considered
to
be
equal
to
his
father
darwin
most
eminent
son
was
a
mathematician
not
a
naturalist
the
reason
of
this
is
that
heredity
follows
the
law
of
recession
to
mediocrity
this
is
that
all
groups
of
living
things
vary
around
an
average
or
mean
as
regards
each
of
their
characters
and
those
near
the
average
are
always
numerous
while
as
we
approach
the
extremes
in
either
direction
the
numbers
become
less
and
less
families
follow
the
same
law
if
you
take
a
family
for
three
or
four
generations
including
perhaps
some
hundreds
of
persons
some
will
be
short
some
tall
but
the
majority
will
be
near
the
mean
and
the
tallest
of
all
will
be
less
likely
to
have
taller
descendants
than
themselves
than
those
nearer
the
average
but
the
children
of
the
tallest
though
generally
shorter
than
their
parents
will
still
tend
to
be
above
the
average
height
when
a
character
is
so
useful
to
its
possessor
in
the
struggle
for
existence
as
to
be
of
what
is
termed
survival
value
then
those
that
vary
most
above
the
average
will
be
preserved
or
selected
generation
after
generation
as
long
as
the
increase
is
useful
it
is
because
the
higher
intellectual
or
moral
powers
are
so
rarely
of
value
and
are
not
unfrequently
the
reverse
that
they
are
not
though
they
are
with
this
explanation
we
will
now
proceed
to
examine
somewhat
closely
our
moral
position
as
a
nation
what
is
the
nature
of
our
social
environment
how
it
came
to
be
what
it
is
and
what
lessons
we
may
learn
from
it
chapter
viii
environment
during
the
nineteenth
century
during
the
eighteenth
century
our
material
civilisation
which
had
long
been
almost
stationary
began
to
advance
with
the
growth
of
the
physical
sciences
but
at
first
with
extreme
slowness
the
earliest
steps
were
made
by
the
application
of
machinery
to
some
of
the
domestic
arts
some
refinements
were
made
in
the
manners
and
customs
of
our
daily
life
but
there
were
few
if
any
indications
of
permanent
or
widespread
change
either
for
better
or
worse
in
our
intellectual
or
moral
nature
the
nineteenth
century
however
saw
the
initiation
of
a
great
change
in
the
economic
environment
due
to
the
rapid
invention
of
machinery
which
with
the
equally
rapid
application
of
steam
power
led
to
an
increase
of
wealth
production
such
as
had
never
been
known
on
the
earth
before
during
the
same
period
new
modes
of
locomotion
were
brought
into
daily
use
the
facilities
for
were
increased
a
scientific
discoveries
opened
up
to
us
new
and
mysteries
of
the
universe
and
the
whole
earth
was
ransacked
for
its
treasures
both
vegetable
and
mineral
to
an
extent
that
surpassed
all
that
had
been
accomplished
since
the
dawn
of
civilisation
but
this
rapid
growth
of
wealth
and
increase
of
our
power
over
nature
put
too
great
a
strain
upon
our
crude
civilisation
and
our
superficial
christianity
and
it
was
accompanied
by
various
forms
of
social
immorality
almost
as
amazing
and
unprecedented
some
of
these
may
be
here
briefly
referred
to
our
vast
textile
factory
system
may
be
said
to
have
commenced
with
the
nineteenth
century
and
the
profits
were
at
first
so
large
and
so
dependent
on
the
supply
of
labour
that
the
hired
children
from
the
workhouses
of
the
great
cities
by
hundreds
and
even
thousands
these
children
from
the
age
of
five
or
six
upwards
were
taken
as
apprentices
for
seven
years
and
they
really
became
the
slaves
of
the
manufacturers
whose
managers
made
them
work
from
to
or
sometimes
longer
and
in
order
to
keep
them
awake
in
the
close
atmosphere
of
the
factories
it
was
found
necessary
to
whip
them
at
frequent
intervals
it
was
not
till
that
the
age
of
children
employed
in
factories
was
raised
to
nine
years
while
in
the
working
hours
were
to
a
week
from
that
time
onward
during
the
whole
of
the
nineteenth
century
there
was
a
continued
succession
of
factory
acts
each
aiming
at
abolishing
or
ameliorating
the
worst
results
of
child
inhumanity
its
cruelty
and
its
immorality
these
legislative
efforts
were
always
opposed
by
the
employers
who
usually
succeeded
in
so
mutilating
them
in
committee
of
the
house
of
commons
as
to
render
them
almost
useless

that
after
nearly
fifty

of

the
condition
of

was
still
in
a
high
degree
cruel
degrading
and
therefore
immoral
while
that
of
the
who
succeeded
them
was
almost
as
injurious
as
the
century
wore
on
other
evils
of
a
similar
nature
were
gradually
brought
to
light
children
and
women
were
found
to
be
working
underground
in
coal
mines
under
equally
vile
conditions
as
regards
health
and
morality
and
an
enormous
loss
of
life
was
caused
by
inadequate
ventilation
insecure
imperfect
winding
machinery
and
other
causes
all
due
to
want
of
proper
precautions
by
the
owners
of
the
mines
as
a
matter
of
simple
justice
such
owners
should
be
held
responsible
to
the
injured
person
not
only
to
the
full
extent
of
his
wages
and
for
medical
attendance
but
should
also
pay
a
liberal
compensation
for
the
pain
suffered
and
for
the
extra
labour
expense
and
anxiety
to
his
family
but
all
such
things
are
ignored
in
the
case
of
poor
workers
so
that
even
the
money
compensation
is
reduced
to
the
smallest
amount
possible
it
is
one
of
the
great
defects
of
our
law
that
deaths
due
to
preventable
causes
any
are
not
criminal
offences
till
they
are
made
so
it
will
be
impossible
to
save
the
hundreds
or
even
thousands
of
lives
now
lost
owing
to
neglect
of
proper
precautions
in
all
kinds
of
dangerous
or
unhealthy
trades
however
costly
such
precautions
may
be
expense
should
not
be
considered
when
human
life
is
risked
and
the
present
state
of
the
law
is
therefore
immoral
notwithstanding
acts
of
parliament
and
numerous
inspectors
whose
salaries
should
be
paid
by
the
mine
owners
explosions
and
other
accidents
underground
continue
to
increase
the
year
being
a
record
year
with
its
deaths
and
even
the
number
in
proportion
to
the
workers
employed
is
the
highest
for
the
last
twenty
years
yet
no
one
is
punished
or
even
held
responsible
for
these
deaths
surely
this
shows
a
deplorable
absence
of
moral
feeling
both
in
the
general
public
and
in
parliament
the
responsibility
of
parliament
is
really
criminal
since
it
always
allows
its
legislation
to
be
made
ineffective
by
the
fear
of
diminishing
the
employers
profits
thus
deliberately
placing
above
human
life
and
human
in
the
case
of
mines
and
quarries
parliament
is
especially
responsible
because
the
possession
of
the
mineral
wealth
of
our
country
by
private
individuals
is
itself
a
gross
usurpation
of
public
rights
and
should
have
been
long
ago
declared
illegal
whatever
they
are
very
us
that
the
land
itself
should
not
be
private
property
are
ten
times
stronger
in
the
case
of
the
minerals
within
its
bowels
the
value
of
land
increases
with
its
proper
use
but
in
the
case
of
minerals
the
value
is
absolutely
destroyed
surely
it
is
a
crime
against
posterity
to
allow
the
strictly
limited
mineral
wealth
of
our
country
to
be
made
private
property
and
very
largely
sold
to
foreigners
solely
to
increase
the
wealth
of
individuals
and
to
the
absolute
impoverishment
of
ourselves
and
our
children
a
a
i
pointed
this
out
forty
years
ago
in
an
article
entitled
a
national
which
i
republished
twelve
years
ago
in
my
scientific
and
vol
chap
i
will
here
add
one
other
argument
which
goes
to
the
root
of
the
matter
by
showing
that
the
alleged
owners
of
minerals
have
not
even
a
legal
title
to
them
it
is
i
believe
a
maxim
of
law
that
public
rights
can
not
be
lost
by
disuse
landed
estates
were
in
our
country
created
by
the
norman
conqueror
to
be
held
subject
to
the
performance
of
feudal
duties
minerals
were
then
not
known
to
exist
and
were
not
i
believe
specifically
included
in
the
original
grants
except
therefore
where
they
have
since
been
made
private
property
by
of
they
still
remain
public
property
i
submit
therefore
that
they
may
be
both
legally
and
equitably
resumed
by
the
government
as
public
property
and
worked
for
the
good
of
the
public
and
of
posterity
compensation
to
the
supposed
present
owners
would
be
a
matter
of
favour

the
era
of
registration
and
a
body
of
health
officers
have
been
set
up
to
report
upon
the
worst
cases
the
local
authorities
have
power
to
compel
the
owners
of
unhealthy
dwellings
to
put
them
into
a
sanitary
condition
or
even
order
them
to
be
entirely
rebuilt
but
as
many
of
the
members
of
corporations
and
other
local
boards
are
often
themselves
owners
of
such
property
or
have
intimate
friends
who
are
so
very
little
has
been
done
to
remedy
the
evil
again
and
again
in
all
parts
of
the
country
the
health
officers
have
duly
reported
but
their
reports
have
been
ignored
in
some
cases
where
the
health
officer
has
been
too
persistent
he
has
been
asked
to
resign
or
has
been
discharged
a
few
general
facts
may
be
here
given
by
the
last
complete
census
returns
there
are
in
england
and
wales
tenements
and
of
these
or
nearly
half
have
from
one
to
four
rooms
only
in
london
out
of
a
total
of
tenements
or
considerably
more
than
half
have
from
one
to
four
rooms
while
there
are
about
tenements
of
only
in
which
are
living
persons
or
about
two
and
a
quarter
persons
in
each
room
on
the
average
there
are
however
about
persons
living
in
a
and
more
who
have
seven
or
eight
in
a
as
most
of
these
tenements
are
either
the
cellars
or
attics
of
houses
in
the
most
crowded
parts
of
large
towns
where
there
is
impure
air
little
light
and
scanty
water
supply
the
condition
of
those
who
dwell
in
them
may
be
rather
be
imagined
except
by
those
who
have
explored
them
equally
inhuman
immoral
and
even
criminal
is
the
neglect
of
all
adequate
measures
to
check
the
loss
of
infant
life
through
the
overwork
poverty
or
starvation
of
the
mother
together
with
overcrowded
and
insanitary
dwellings
in
the
mad
race
for
wealth
by
capitalists
and
employers
most
of
our
towns
and
cities
have
been
allowed
to
develop
into
veritable
for
the
poor
this
has
been
known
for
the
greater
part
of
a
century
yet
nothing
really
effective
has
been
done
notwithstanding
abundant
health
made
useless
by
the
dread
of
diminishing
the
excessive
profits
of
manufacturers
and
one
of
the
labour
newspapers
calls
our
attention
to
the
following

such
facts
exist
all
over
the
kingdom
they
have
been
talked
about
and
deplored
for
the
last
at
least
who
has
murdered
the
children
who
die
annually
before
they
are
one

old
who
has
robbed
the
millions
that
just
survive
of
all
that
makes
childhood

fresh

play
rest
sleep
and
proper
nurture
and
teaching
again
we
must
answer
our
parliament
which
occupies
itself
with
anything
rather
than
the
immediate
saving
of
human
life
and
abolishing
widespread
human
misery
the
whole
of
which
is
remediable
and
all
for
fear
of
offending
the
rich
and
powerful
by
some
diminution
of
their
accumulations
of
wealth
no
thinking
man
or
woman
can
believe
that
this
state
of
things
is
absolutely
irremediable
and
the
persistent
acquiescence
in
it
while
loudly
boasting
of
our
civilisation
of
our
science
of
our
national
prosperity
and
of
our
christianity
is
the
proof
of
a
hypocritical
lack
of
national
morality
that
has
never
been
surpassed
in
any
former
age
a
new
set
of
evils
has
grown
up
in
the
various
unhealthy
trades
lead
glaze
in
the
china
manufacture
the
steel
dust
in
cutlery
work
and
the
endless
variety
of
poisonous
liquids
and
vapours
in
the
numerous
chemical
works
or
processes
by
which
so
many
fortunes
have
been
made
these
together
are
the
cause
of
a
large
direct
loss
of
life
and
a
much
larger
amount
of
permanent
injury
together
with
a
terrible
reduction
in
the
duration
of
life
of
all
the
workers
in
such
trades
yet
in
one
case
of
phosphorus
any
such
injurious
process
of
manufacture
been
put
an
end
to
wealth
has
been
deliberately
preferred
to
human
life
and
happiness
a
a
an
account
of
some
deadly
trades
is
given
in
sherard
book
white
slaves
of
one
of
the
most
deadly
of
trades
seems
to
have
remained
unnoticed
till
it
has
been
brought
to
light
by
the
new
labour
paper
daily
in
a
series
of
articles
by
keighley
snowden
entitled
broken
never
was
a
title
better
deserved
since
large
numbers
of
girls
and
young
women
are
employed
at
lye
and
cradley
heath
in
what
is
commonly
named
the
hollow
ware
works
this
is
the
tinning
or
galvanising
as
it
is
usually
termed
of
buckets
and
other
domestic
utensils
in
which
lead
is
used
and
it
produces
one
of
the
most
virulent
forms
of
the
symptoms
are
among
other
more
painful
ones
the
loss
of
hair
and
the
loosening
and
ultimate
loss
of
teeth
culminating
either
in
chronic
illness
or
death
sometimes
in
a
few
months
or
years
five
years
ago
there
was
a
home
office
inquiry
which
after
full
examination
reported
that
the
process
used
was
dangerous
to
life
that
no
precautions
could
render
it
harmless
and
that
it
should
be
an
order
was
then
issued
by
the
home
office
that
after
a
two
years
the
process
should
be
no
longer
used
but
that
order
has
not
been
obeyed
except
by
a
few
employers
to
this
day
the
deadly
nature
of
this
work
was
accompanied
by
miserably
low
wages
as
shown
by
the
fact
that
the
women
workers
have
at
length
struck
to
obtain
a
minimum
of
a
week
helped
by
some
humane
friends
they
have
at
length
succeeded
in
obtaining
this
miserable
wage
and
for
the
present
are
in
a
state
of
comparative
happiness
how
long
it
will
be
before
the
government
abolishes
this
deadly
process
we
can
not
tell
the
following
is
a
brief
statement
of
what
these
poor
women
have
to
suffer
extracted
from
daily
of
november
they
had
without
power
to
resist
them
suffered
repeated
and
ruthless
reductions
of
wages
they
had
seen
their
industry
brought
down
by
reckless
competition
and
the
manufacture
of
shoddy
goods
to
the
point
at
which
men
could
no
longer
earn
enough
to
support
their
families
they
had
seen
their
wives
and
daughters
and
boys
forced
by
want
at
home
into
workshops
where
as
official
inquiry
has
shown
health
was
sucked
out
of
their
bodies
as
though
they
had
been
the
victims
of
vampires
they
had
seen
the
introduction
and
growth
of
the
system
under
which
boyhood
and
girlhood
and
motherhood
were
driven
as
though
they
had
been
slaves
under
the
lash
and
their
earnings
cut
down
to
a
penny
an
hour
meanwhile
they
lived
in
the
hovels
and
holes
of
a
place
which
can
only
be
fitly
described
as
one
of
the
dirtiest
ashpits
of
a
civilisation
reckless
of
dirt
where
profit
is
a
question
those
who
want
to
know
what
horrors
can
exist
in
england
should
read
snowden
series
of
articles
on
the
subject
they
are
restrained
in
language
and
state
the
bare
facts
from
careful
personal
observation
that
such
things
should
still
exist
in
a
country
claiming
to
be
civilised
would
be
incredible
were
there
not
so
many
others
of
a
like
nature
and
almost
as
bad
in
an
almost
exhaustive
volume
on
of
by
sir
thomas
oliver
there
is
only
a
short
reference
to
the
hollowware
trade
of
the
black
country
near
birmingham
but
the
tin
plate
industry
of
south
wales
is
more
fully
described
with
the
same
pitiable
condition
of
the
women
workers
and
the
same
terrible
results
to
health
and
life
yet
nothing
whatever
seems
to
be
done
by
the
manufacturers
and
though
two
home
office
inspectors
have
fully
reported
on
its
horrors
from
onwards
no
notice
appears
to
have
been
taken
of
them
nor
has
there
been
any
government
interference
with
conditions
of
labour
which
are
a
disgrace
to
civilisation
chapter
x
adulteration
bribery
and
gambling
after
the
terrible
national
crime
of
deadly
employments
it
is
almost
an
to
enumerate
the
vast
mass
of
dishonesty
and
falsehood
that
pervades
our
commercial
system
in
every
department
almost
every
fabric
whether
of
cotton
linen
wool
or
silk
is
so
widely
and
ingeniously
adulterated
by
the
intermixture
of
cheaper
materials
that
the
pure
article
as
supplied
to
our
grandparents
is
hardly
to
be
obtained
of
this
one
example
only
must
serve
calicoes
have
been
successively
dressed
with
such
substances
as
paste
and
tallow
then
with
the
still
cheaper
china
clay
and
size
and
in
some
cases
from
to
per
cent
of
these
latter
materials
have
been
sold
as
calico
for
exportation
to
countries
inhabited
by
what
we
term
savages
these
people
only
found
out
the
deception
when
the
need
for
washing
or
exposure
to
tropical
rains
reduced
the
material
to
a
flimsy
and
worthless
rag
as
i
have
myself
witnessed
in
some
parts
of
the
malay
archipelago
a
a
these
facts
are
given
in
the
ninth
edition
of
the
encyclopædia
britannica
in
recent
editions
the
article
is
limited
to
food
and
drugs
in
encyclopædia
cotton
linen
and
woollens
are
included
among
adulterated
fabrics
even
worse
is
the
adulteration
of
almost
every
kind
of
prepared
the
showy
sweetmeats
which
tempt
our
various
chemicals
which
are
often
injurious
to
health
and
sometimes
fatal
while
even
the
drugs
we
take
in
the
endeavour
to
cure
our
various
ailments
are
frequently
so
treated
as
to
be
useless
or
even
hurtful
along
with
this
form
of
dishonesty
is
what
may
be
termed
simple
cheating
in
the
description
of
goods
sold
especially
as
to
quantity
threads
and
fabrics
are
generally
shorter
or
narrower
than
stated
giving
a
larger
profit
when
sold
in
enormous
quantities
in
our
great
retail
shops
then
again
there
is
a
widespread
system
of
bribery
of
servants
or
other
employees
in
order
to
obtain
more
customers
or
to
secure
contracts
and
though
these
are
all
criminal
offences
and
a
great
host
of
inspectors
and
official
analysts
are
employed
to
discover
and
convict
the
offenders
yet
so
few
people
are
willing
to
take
the
trouble
and
lose
the
time
and
money
involved
in
putting
the
law
into
motion
that
a
very
large
percentage
of
these
offences
go
undiscovered
and
unpunished
yet
another
and
more
serious
form
of
plunder
of
the
public
is
carried
on
by
means
of
joint
stock
companies
of
which
there
are
now
more
than
in
england
and
wales
in
the
year
the
number
of
new
companies
was
while
ceased
to
exist
giving
an
increase
of
in
the
year
the
limited
liability
act
was
passed
in
in
order
that
the
public
might
invest
their
savings
in
companies
and
thus
share
in
the
profits
of
our
industry
and
commerce
it
was
supposed
to
be
quite
proper
that
anyone
should
benefit
by
the
enterprise
and
industry
of
others
but
to
do
so
is
essentially
immoral
and
has
resulted
in
a
vast
system
of
swindling
and
terrible
losses
to
the
innocent
investors
the
promoters
directors
secretaries
and
bankers
of
these
companies
always
gain
those
that
take
up
the
shares
often
lose
and
the
amount
of
misery
and
absolute
ruin
of
those
who
fondly
hoped
to
add
to
their
scanty
incomes
and
have
been
deluded
by
the
names
of
public
men
among
the
directors
is
incalculable
our
stock
exchanges
too
are
used
largely
for
pure
gambling
which
owing
to
its
vast
extent
and
being
carried
on
under
business
forms
is
perhaps
more
ruinous
than
any
other
but
this
form
of
gambling
goes
on
unchecked
and
is
generally
accepted
as
quite
honest
business
yet
ordinary
betting
on
races
and
other
forms
of
direct
gambling
are
hypocritically
condemned
as
immoral
and
criminal
the
vast
fabric
of
our
foreign
trade
in
food
or
the
raw
materials
of
our
manufactures
is
also
used
to
support
perhaps
the
greatest
system
of
gambling
the
world
has
ever
seen
the
fluctuating
prices
of
corn
or
cotton
of
coal
or
mineral
oil
of
iron
and
other
metals
in
the
great
markets
of
the
world
are
used
in
two
ways
by
a
large
community
of
gamblers
who
not
only
do
not
require
the
goods
they
buy
but
who
never
see
nor
possess
them
the
ordinary
speculator
who
buys
when
prices
are
low
to
sell
again
at
a
profit
without
himself
being
able
to
influence
the
rise
or
fall
of
price
is
a
pure
gambler
who
thinks
he
can
foresee
the
changes
of
the
market
price
in
the
immediate
future
but
the
great
capitalists
who
either
singly
or
by
means
of
what
are
called
rings
or
combines
purchase
such
vast
quantities
of
the
special
product
as
to
create
a
scarcity
in
the
market
leading
to
a
large
rise
of
price
are
ingenious
robbers
rather
than
gamblers
because
by
clever
dealings
with
such
a
monopoly
often
aided
by
false
rumours
widely
circulated
in
newspapers
owned
or
bribed
by
them
they
are
able
to
make
enormous
profits
at
the
expense
of
those
who
are
obliged
to
purchase
for
actual
business
purposes
or
for
daily
use
this
is
one
of
the
methods
by
which
the
great
millionaires
and
of
the
world
accumulate
their
wealth
every
penny
of
which
is
at
the
cost
of
the
consuming
public
this
is
certainly
as
immoral
as
any
of
the
petty
forms
of
swindling
with
marked
cards
loaded
dice
or
the
wilful
losing
of
a
race
yet
the
possessors
of
such
wealth
are
usually
held
to
be
clever
business
men
whose
morality
is
not
questioned
all
these
inconsistencies
as
regards
the
moral
status
of
various
kinds
of
gambling
or
dishonest
speculation
arise
from
our
inveterate
habit
of
dealing
with
limited
cases
each
judged
on
its
supposed
merits
as
to
consequences
instead
of
looking
to
fundamental
principles
why
is
gambling
immoral
not
because
it
is
a
game
of
chance
entered
into
for
mere
amusement
even
when
played
for
small
money
stakes
which
are
of
no
importance
to
any
of
the
players
the
fundamental
wrong
arises
whenever
it
is
used
for
obtaining
wealth
or
any
part
of
the
income
and
the
reason
is
that
whatever
one
wins
someone
else
loses
while
its
evil
nature
socially
depends
upon
the
fact
that
whoever
acquires
wealth
by
such
means
contributes
nothing
useful
to
the
social
organism
of
which
he
forms
a
part
if
it
were
taught
to
every
child
and
in
every
school
and
college
that
it
is
morally
wrong
for
anyone
to
live
upon
the
combined
labour
of
his
without
contributing
an
approximately
equal
amount
of
useful
labour
whether
physical
or
mental
in
return
all
kinds
of
gambling
as
well
as
many
other
kinds
of
useless
occupation
would
be
seen
to
be
of
the
same
nature
as
direct
dishonesty
or
fraud
and
therefore
would
soon
come
to
be
considered
disgraceful
as
well
as
immoral
we
see
then
that
the
whole
commercial
fabric
of
our
immense
mills
and
factories
our
vast
exports
and
imports
our
home
trade
wholesale
and
retail
and
innumerable
transactions
in
our
stock
permeated
with
various
forms
of
dishonesty
gambling
and
direct
robbery
of
individuals
or
of
the
public
no
class
is
wholly
free
from
it
and
it
increases
in
volume
from
decade
to
decade
just
as
our
boasted
commerce
and
accumulated
wealth
increases
i
have
here
called
attention
to
these
various
forms
of
immoral
practices
because
they
are
so
often
ignored
yet
they
are
all
officially
admitted
by
the
enormous
mass
of
the
various
royal
commissions
parliamentary
and
other
reports
as
well
as
by
the
hundreds
of
acts
by
which
successive
parliaments
have
endeavoured
to
deal
with
them
but
which
have
one
and
all
proved
to
be
either
wholly
or
partially
ineffective
the
reason
of
this
failure
is
that
in
every
case
symptoms
and
isolated
results
only
have
been
considered
while
the
underlying
causes
of
the
whole
vast
mass
of
social
corruption
have
never
been
sought
for
or
if
known
have
never
influenced
legislation
chapter
xi
our
administration
of
justice
is
immoral
when
we
read
about
the
turkish
or
other
eastern
law
courts
in
which
direct
bribery
of
every
official
up
to
the
judge
himself
is
a
regular
feature
we
are
horrified
and
are
apt
to
proclaim
the
fact
that
our
judges
never
take
bribes
but
practically
it
comes
to
very
nearly
the
same
thing
in
england
no
single
step
can
be
made
for
the
purpose
of
getting
justice
without
paying
fees
while
the
whole
process
of
bringing
or
defending
an
is
so
absurdly
complex
as
to
be
almost
incredible
jeremy
bentham
satirised
this
by
supposing
a
father
of
a
large
family
to
adopt
the
same
method
of
settling
a
dispute
between
two
of
his
sons
he
would
not
hear
either
of
them
himself
but
each
must
tell
his
story
to
a
stranger
a
solicitor
who
wrote
it
down
and
then
instructed
another
stranger
a
barrister
to
explain
it
to
the
father
as
judge
and
twelve
neighbours
the
jury
then
the
stranger
barrister
on
each
side
asked
questions
of
all
the
family
who
knew
anything
about
it
and
the
barristers
who
had
only
knowledge
of
the
facts
tried
to
make
each
witness
contradict
himself
or
to
acknowledge
having
done
something
as
bad
another
time
till
the
jury
became
quite
puzzled
and
often
decided
as
the
cleverest
of
the
barristers
told
them
that
is
really
the
system
of
law
courts
to
this
day
and
it
is
grossly
unfair
because
the
party
who
can
pay
the
highest
fees
for
the
services
of
the
most
experienced
counsel
is
most
likely
through
the
lawyer
skill
and
eloquence
to
secure
a
verdict
in
his
favour
yet
there
is
no
effective
protest
against
this
unjust
and
absurd
system
which
absolutely
denies
all
redress
of
wrongs
to
the
poor
man
when
oppressed
by
a
rich
one
one
would
think
it
that
justice
ceases
to
be
justice
when
it
has
to
be
paid
for
but
the
system
is
so
the
profession
of
a
barrister
so
honoured
and
its
rewards
so
great
that
it
will
never
be
abolished
till
there
comes
about
in
our
social
system
that
fundamental
change
which
will
cut
at
the
very
of
almost
all
our
existing
immorality
and
crime
in
our
criminal
as
well
as
our
civil
law
and
procedure
there
is
equal
injustice
when
the
poor
man
is
accused
of
the
slightest
offence
and
brought
before
a
magistrate
by
the
police
he
is
even
though
perfectly
honest
and
respectable
treated
from
the
very
first
as
if
he
were
guilty
often
refused
communication
with
his
friends
and
when
the
accusation
is
serious
he
is
remanded
to
prison
again
and
again
till
evidence
has
been
hunted
up
or
even
manufactured
against
him
experience
shows
that
the
latter
is
often
done
and
a
quite
innocent
man
not
infrequently
punished
the
dictum
of
the
law
that
an
englishman
should
be
held
to
be
innocent
till
he
is
proved
to
be
guilty
is
absolutely
reversed
and
he
is
treated
as
if
he
were
guilty
till
against
overwhelming
odds
he
is
able
to
prove
himself
innocent
there
is
no
possible
excuse
for
this
now
and
at
the
very
least
every
man
who
has
a
home
or
a
permanent
employment
should
be
at
once
discharged
on
his
own
recognizances
equally
unjust
and
barbarous
is
the
system
of
often
for
merely
nominal
offences
with
the
alternative
of
imprisonment
to
the
or
to
the
habitual
criminal
the
fine
is
a
trifle
but
to
the
poor
man
charged
with
being
drunk
with
begging
or
with
sleeping
under
a
haystack
or
any
such
act
which
is
no
real
offence
the
common
punishment
of
or
a
week
imprisonment
leaving
perhaps
wife
and
children
to
starve
or
be
sent
to
the
workhouse
is
really
far
more
immoral
than
the
alleged
offence
again
our
poor
law
itself
as
usually
administered
is
utterly
immoral
this
is
what
a
competent
sidney
of
it
underneath
the
feet
of
the
whole
class
is
the
abyss
of
the
poor
law
i
see
before
me
a
respectable
family
applying
for
relief
what
do
we
do
to
them
we
the
government
of
england
break
up
the
family
we
strip
each
individual
of
what
makes
life
worth
living
when
the
man
enters
the
workhouse
he
is
stripped
of
his
as
too
infamous
to
vote
for
a
member
of
parliament
once
in
the
workhouse
we
put
him
to
toil
or
to
loiter
under
conditions
that
are
so
demoralising
that
we
turn
him
into
a
wastrel
and
we
strip
the
wife
of
her
children
we
send
her
to
the
or
the
where
she
associates
with
prostitutes
and
imbeciles
the
little
children
if
they
are
under
five
are
taken
to
the
workhouse
nursery
where
they
also
are
tended
by
prostitutes
and
imbeciles
there
they
remain
day
after
day
without
ever
going
down
the
workhouse
steps
until
they
are
old
enough
to
go
to
the
poor
law
school
or
until
they
are
taken
down
in
their
coffins
owing
to
the
terrible
mortality
among
the
workhouse
babies
of
course
all
workhouses
are
not
so
bad
as
this
but
many
are
and
have
been
during
the
of
a
century
of
their
existence
can
we
therefore
wonder
that
week
by
week
some
poor
and
honest
parents
commit
suicide
rather
than
see
their
children
starve
or
be
separated
from
them
in
the
workhouse
the
people
we
thus
drive
to
death
are
many
of
them
as
good
as
we
ourselves
are
yet
the
guardians
of
the
poor
gentlemen
and
on
administering
it
week
after
week
and
year
after
year
without
protest
or
apparent
compunction
such
is
the
deadening
effect
of
custom
chapter
xii
indications
of
increasing
moral
degradation
there
are
in
the
reports
of
the
a
few
statistics
of
special
importance
because
they
clearly
point
to
certain
kinds
of
moral
degradation
which
have
been
increasing
for
the
last
thus
coinciding
with
our
exceptionally
rapid
increase
in
wealth
and
also
as
i
have
shown
in
preceding
chapters
with
various
forms
of
national
economic
and
social
deterioration
the
first
of
these
is
the
continuous
increase
in
deaths
from
alcoholism
in
proportion
to
population
since
the
year
most
persons
will
be
amazed
to
find
that
this
is
the
case
because
the
drinking
habit
has
certainly
diminished
but
when
the
habit
becomes
so
powerful
and
lasts
so
long
as
to
be
the
direct
cause
of
death
we
are
able
to
see
the
dimensions
of
the
most
exaggerated
form
of
the
drink
evil
the
following
figures
are
taken
from
the
successive
reports
referred
to
from
alcoholism
per
of
million
there
are
some
irregularities
the
ratio
being
nearly
equal
for
the
first
twenty
years
after
which
there
is
such
a
continuous
large
increase
that
from
to
the
mortality
is
doubled
but
for
the
last
ten
years
there
has
been
a
decrease
which
in
the
last
five
years
is
very
marked
but
a
still
worse
and
more
disquieting
feature
is
the
recent
large
increase
of
mortality
from
alcoholism
in
women
figures
for
the
separate
sexes
were
not
given
till
and
the
following
table
shows
the
comparison
up
to
from
alcoholism
of
per
these
figures
however
deplorable
and
startling
in
themselves
are
as
nothing
in
comparison
with
what
they
imply
death
from
drink
more
than
in
the
case
of
any
other
disease
is
the
ultimate
and
rarely
attained
result
of
the
vice
of
habitual
intoxication
men
and
women
may
greatly
injure
their
health
ruin
their
families
and
be
disgraceful
drunkards
and
yet
not
die
of
it
or
make
any
near
approach
to
doing
so
what
is
the
proportion
of
those
who
are
morally
and
physically
injured
by
drink
to
those
who
kill
themselves
by
it
is
i
suppose
unknown
but
i
imagine
that
one
in
a
thousand
is
probably
too
high
an
estimate
and
that
one
death
among
ten
thousand
moderate
drinkers
who
also
occasionally
or
frequently
become
intoxicated
would
be
nearer
the
mark
this
would
imply
an
increase
in
the
consumption
of
alcoholic
drinks
instead
of
which
there
has
been
an
actual
diminution
the
fact
probably
is
that
a
very
large
number
of
moderate
drinkers
have
ceased
to
consume
alcohol
in
any
form
and
this
would
account
for
a
much
larger
reduction
in
the
total
than
has
actually
occurred
on
the
other
hand
owing
to
the
increase
of
those
who
are
only
casually
employed
in
our
great
cities
and
whose
one
luxury
is
the
excitement
of
drink
a
larger
quantity
of
cheap
and
injuriously
adulterated
spirits
and
other
liquors
is
consumed
which
combined
with
a
deficiency
of
wholesome
food
leads
more
frequently
to
a
fatal
result
of
the
increase
has
been
long
known
and
generally
admitted
it
is
supposed
to
be
largely
due
to
the
struggle
for
subsistence
in
our
great
cities
the
consequent
increase
of
unemployment
and
the
dread
of
the
workhouse
as
the
only
alternative
to
starvation
the
following
are
the
figures
for
the
last
years
for
which
official
data
have
been
published
by
suicide
per
of
million
such
a
table
as
this
occurring
in
a
country
which
boasts
of
its
enormous
wealth
of
its
commercial
prosperity
of
its
marvellous
advance
in
science
and
the
arts
and
command
of
natural
forces
should
surely
give
us
pause
and
force
upon
us
the
conviction
that
there
is
something
radically
wrong
in
a
social
system
which
brings
about
such
terrible
evils
and
this
should
be
the
more
certainly
seen
to
be
the
case
because
the
same
increase
is
taking
place
in
all
those
countries
which
approach
us
in
their
wealth
and
their
commercial
prosperity
there
is
a
group
of
diseases
which
are
fatal
to
infants
soon
after
birth
they
have
been
steadily
increasing
during
the
last
and
call
for
special
notice
here
as
they
seem
to
indicate
physical
degeneration
as
well
as
personal
immorality
of
a
dangerous
and
perhaps
even
a
criminal
nature
of
deaths
to
the
large
increase
during
the
last
years
of
very
early
infantile
deaths
involving
abnormalities
of
mother
or
child
seems
very
significant
the
first
may
be
connected
with
the
increasing
dislike
of
and
unsuccessful
attempts
to
avoid
it
the
second
indicates
some
injurious
condition
of
life
of
the
mother
such
as
working
at
unhealthy
or
even
deadly
trades
which
has
certainly
been
largely
increasing
during
the
same
period
such
work
for
young
married
women
should
be
impossible
in
a
civilised
community
on
the
vast
subject
of
prostitution
of
which
the
present
movement
for
the
suppression
of
what
is
called
the
white
slave
traffic
is
but
one
of
the
aspects
i
do
not
propose
to
dwell
because
i
can
find
no
statistics
to
show
whether
it
has
increased
or
decreased
during
the
last
century
but
as
the
conditions
have
all
been
favourable
for
it
i
have
little
doubt
that
it
has
increased
in
proportion
to
population
such
conditions
are
the
enormous
growth
of
great
cities
an
increasing
number
of
unmarried
and
wealthy
young
men
with
an
enormous
number
of
girls
and
young
women
whose
wages
are
insufficient
to
provide
them
with
the
rational
enjoyments
of
life
the
proceedings
of
the
divorce
courts
show
other
aspects
of
the
result
of
wealth
and
leisure
while
a
friend
who
had
been
a
good
deal
in
london
society
assured
me
that
both
in
country
houses
and
in
london
various
kinds
of
orgies
were
occasionally
to
be
met
with
which
could
hardly
have
been
surpassed
in
the
rome
of
the
most
dissolute
emperors
of
war
too
i
need
say
nothing
it
has
always
been
more
or
less
chronic
since
the
rise
of
the
roman
empire
but
there
is
now
undoubtedly
a
disinclination
for
war
among
all
civilised
peoples
yet
the
vast
burden
of
armaments
taken
together
with
the
most
pious
declarations
in
favour
of
peace
must
be
held
to
show
an
almost
total
absence
of
morality
as
a
guiding
principle
among
the
governing
classes
in
this
respect
the
increasing
power
of
all
over
the
world
seems
to
afford
the
only
hope
of
a
real
moral
advance
part
chapter
xiii
natural
selection
among
animals
while
writing
the
present
volume
i
was
led
to
refer
to
it
during
some
of
the
numerous
interviews
on
the
occasion
of
my
recent
birthday
this
led
to
some
misrepresentation
of
my
views
and
showed
me
how
few
popular
have
any
real
knowledge
of
the
nature
and
extent
of
natural
selection
more
especially
as
it
affects
the
human
race
there
is
also
the
same
ignorance
as
regards
heredity
and
this
latter
has
become
almost
a
word
to
conjure
with
and
is
thought
by
most
writers
to
explain
many
things
to
which
it
is
quite
inapplicable
and
as
the
present
work
is
a
very
condensed
argument
founded
to
a
considerable
extent
upon
these
great
natural
laws
i
propose
devoting
two
chapters
to
explaining
and
demonstrating
the
effect
of
natural
selection
in
the
case
of
the
lower
animals
and
of
man
respectively
that
such
an
explanation
is
necessary
may
be
seen
from
the
following
extract
from
one
of
our
most
influential
and
daily
papers
the
mall
after
referring
to
the
view
of
the
utter
rottenness
of
our
present
civilisation
it
quotes
me
as
saying
and
the
average
of
mankind
will
remain
the
same
until
natural
selection
steps
in
to
save
it
what
i
actually
said
to
the
interviewer
was
until
some
form
of
selection
improves
it
the
writer
then
goes
on
these
words
must
have
struck
the
interviewer
like
the
crack
of
doom
for
stated
popularly
the
theory
of
natural
selection
is
the
doctrine
of
take
the
hindmost
if
natural
selection
had
fair
play
there
would
be
no
children
care
committees
there
would
be
no
poor
law
no
hospitals
there
would
be
no
old
age
pensions
all
the
humanitarian
effort
to
care
for
the
weak
and
to
help
them
along
the
path
of
life
every
effort
to
bind
up
the
every
combination
of
labour
to
secure
equality
among
the
members
of
a
trade
stand
condemned
as
futile
or
worse
by
the
doctrine
which
russel
wallace
thinks
can
alone
raise
the
average
of
man
his
own
remedies
for
the
ills
of
levelling
up
which
he
believes
to
be
impossible
without
levelling
down
the
disinheriting
of
the
unborn
heir
the
which
he
applauds
the
universal
education
which
he
these
are
directly
antagonistic
to
the
workings
of
natural
selection
now
as
i
am
credited
by
all
my
scientific
friends
with
having
discovered
the
theory
of
natural
selection
more
than
fifty
years
ago
and
as
the
whole
reading
public
have
had
this
hammered
into
them
with
needless
repetition
during
the
whole
of
that
period
it
is
rather
amusing
to
be
told
now
that
i
do
not
know
what
natural
selection
is
nor
what
it
implies
it
is
also
a
striking
proof
that
the
whole
subject
is
now
held
to
be
so
old
and
commonplace
as
not
to
be
worth
studying
by
a
popular
teacher
before
writing
about
it
so
strongly
and
dogmatically
if
he
had
done
so
he
would
not
deliberately
assert
that
i
hold
opinions
in
regard
to
the
matter
which
in
several
of
my
books
i
have
shown
the
fallacy
of
i
propose
therefore
to
give
here
a
short
account
of
the
essential
features
of
the
theory
of
natural
selection
how
it
has
operated
in
bringing
about
the
evolution
of
the
almost
infinitely
varied
forms
of
plants
and
of
the
lower
animals
and
also
to
explain
as
clearly
as
i
can
why
and
to
what
extent
it
has
acted
differently
in
the
case
of
man
and
they
the
first
great
naturalist
who
put
forward
a
detailed
explanation
of
how
he
supposed
the
varied
forms
of
animal
life
to
have
been
produced
was
lamarck
a
contemporary
of
buffon
and
goethe
both
of
whom
believed
in
evolution
but
offered
no
explanation
of
how
it
could
have
been
brought
about
lamarck
however
suggested
that
the
various
organs
of
animals
were
modified
by
voluntary
effort
producing
increased
development
as
when
an
antelope
escapes
from
a
lion
by
its
swiftness
which
swiftness
is
increased
by
the
straining
of
its
limbs
in
flight
while
the
long
neck
and
of
the
giraffe
were
explained
by
the
continual
stretching
of
these
parts
of
the
body
to
obtain
foliage
for
food
during
severe
droughts
in
addition
to
this
other
causes
are
at
work
as
described
in
the
following
passage
translated
or
paraphrased
by
sir
charles
lyell
in
his
of
every
considerable
alteration
in
the
local
conditions
under
which
each
race
of
animals
exists
causes
a
change
in
their
wants
and
these
new
wants
excite
them
to
new
actions
and
habits
these
actions
require
the
more
frequent
employment
of
some
parts
before
but
slightly
exercised
and
then
greater
development
follows
as
a
consequence
of
their
more
frequent
use
other
organs
no
longer
in
use
are
impoverished
and
diminished
in
size
nay
are
sometimes
entirely
annihilated
while
in
their
place
new
parts
are
insensibly
produced
for
the
discharge
of
new
functions
again
he
says
thus
otters
beavers
turtles
and
frogs
were
not
made
in
order
that
they
might
swim
but
their
wants
having
attracted
them
to
the
water
in
search
of
prey
they
stretched
out
the
toes
of
their
feet
to
strike
the
water
and
move
rapidly
along
its
surface
by
the
repeated
stretching
of
their
toes
the
skin
which
united
them
at
the
base
acquired
a
habit
of
extension
until
in
the
course
of
time
the
broad
membranes
which
now
connect
their
extremities
were
formed
in
the
case
of
plants
where
no
voluntary
movements
occur
the
cause
of
modification
was
said
to
be
due
almost
exclusively
to
the
change
of
local
conditions
as
the
various
kinds
of
plants
became
dispersed
over
the
earth
surface
the
influence
of
soil
of
temperature
of
light
and
shade
are
supposed
to
produce
definite
changes
which
are
gradually
increased
just
as
plants
long
cultivated
in
our
gardens
have
become
so
changed
that
the
wild
progenitors
can
not
now
be
recognised
sir
charles
lyell
who
made
a
careful
study
of
lamarck
great
work
notes
especially
that
the
whole
of
the
argument
is
vague
and
general
and
that
no
cases
are
given
in
which
is
shown
how
the
alleged
causes
can
be
supposed
to
have
acted
so
as
to
bring
about
the
innumerable
changes
that
must
have
occurred
what
is
more
important
however
is
the
failure
to
explain
how
the
numerous
minute
adaptations
of
each
species
to
its
environment
could
have
arisen
by
the
direct
action
of
that
plants
the
infinitely
varied
forms
of
leaves
flowers
and
fruits
in
animals
the
forms
and
sizes
of
the
teeth
of
mammalia
and
of
the
beaks
wings
and
feet
of
birds
to
the
food
they
obtain
while
the
enormous
range
of
colour
and
marking
in
most
groups
of
animals
are
such
as
no
amount
of
desire
or
exertion
on
the
one
hand
or
direct
action
of
external
causes
on
the
other
could
possibly
have
brought
about
it
is
not
therefore
surprising
that
although
a
vast
amount
of
evidence
was
adduced
to
show
that
changes
had
taken
place
leading
to
the
evolution
of
species
from
species
yet
causes
adequate
to
bring
about
the
changes
and
especially
those
necessary
to
produce
the
marvellous
adaptations
continually
being
discovered
had
not
been
shown
to
exist
it
is
necessary
to
point
this
out
because
the
difference
between
the
almost
universal
rejection
of
lamarck
attempted
solution
of
the
problem
of
evolution
and
the
almost
immediate
and
universal
acceptance
of
that
adduced
by
darwin
is
otherwise
unexplained
the
belief
in
the
doctrine
of
evolution
as
the
only
rational
explanation
of
the
gradual
development
of
the
innumerable
forms
of
living
things
became
more
and
more
general
the
great
body
of
arguments
in
its
favour
were
admirably
set
forth
by
robert
chambers
in
his
of
published
anonymously
in
while
herbert
spencer
masterly
exposition
of
the
argument
for
universal
evolution
convinced
a
large
number
of
naturalists
and
men
of
science
but
still
the
nature
of
the
laws
and
forces
by
which
the
evolution
of
the
organic
world
in
all
its
variety
and
beauty
could
have
been
brought
about
remained
not
only
unknown
but
unimagined
so
that
even
so
great
a
thinker
as
sir
john
herschel
termed
it
the
mystery
of
mysteries
i
will
now
state
as
briefly
as
possible
the
essential
features
of
darwin
solution
of
the
mystery
in
his
work
origin
of
selection
as
the
essential
factor
in
the
origin
of
there
are
two
great
universal
and
very
conspicuous
characteristics
of
the
whole
organic
world
which
because
they
are
so
very
common
were
almost
ignored
before
darwin
showed
their
importance
these
are
the
great
in
all
common
and
widespread
species
and
their
enormous
powers
of
the
facts
of
variability
are
recorded
in
every
book
on
darwinism
or
on
organic
evolution
and
it
is
only
necessary
here
to
appeal
to
the
reader
own
observation
or
to
state
a
few
illustrative
facts
everybody
sees
that
among
a
hundred
or
a
thousand
people
he
knows
or
frequently
meets
no
two
are
alike
this
is
he
also
knows
that
the
amount
of
the
differences
between
them
is
often
very
large
and
always
if
you
have
any
two
of
them
side
by
side
easily
perceptible
and
capable
of
being
described
he
also
knows
that
they
differ
in
every
part
and
organ
that
can
be
seen
the
height
the
bulk
of
body
the
shape
of
the
hands
feet
head
ears
nose
and
mouth
the
proportions
of
the
legs
arms
and
body
to
each
other
the
abundance
and
character
of
the
or
fine
straight
or
curly
and
of
all
colours
between
flaxen
and
intense
black
to
declare
that
variability
among
men
and
women
even
of
the
same
race
and
in
the
same
country
is
a
rare
phenomenon
and
that
in
amount
it
is
infinitesimal
would
be
a
ludicrous
misstatement
of
the
facts
or
a
wilful
perversion
of
the
truth
but
as
regards
animals
or
plants
in
a
state
of
nature
this
misstatement
has
been
made
and
has
been
used
as
an
argument
against
the
darwinian
theory
it
is
however
now
well
known
as
a
matter
of
direct
observation
and
measurement
that
when
a
few
scores
or
hundreds
of
individuals
are
compared
even
in
the
same
district
and
at
the
same
season
they
differ
in
their
proportions
to
about
the
same
amount
and
to
some
extent
in
every
visible
part
or
organ
as
do
human
beings
this
however
was
not
well
known
when
darwin
collected
the
materials
for
his
various
works
and
he
even
sometimes
makes
the
if
they
vary
for
without
variation
selection
can
do
nothing
and
this
has
been
taken
as
an
admission
that
variation
is
a
rare
instead
of
being
a
universal
phenomenon
he
also
often
spoke
of
the
accumulation
of
or
variations
and
this
has
led
to
the
statement
that
variations
are
in
amount
and
therefore
could
at
first
be
of
no
use
to
the
possessor
in
the
struggle
for
existence
increase
of
all
this
is
another
fact
of
nature
which
requires
to
be
kept
in
mind
in
all
discussions
of
the
action
of
natural
selection
yet
it
is
often
altogether
ignored
by
critics
of
the
theory
as
an
illustrative
fact
a
not
uncommon
european
weed
of
the
cruciferæ
family
has
been
found
to
produce
about
seeds
on
a
single
plant
whence
it
can
be
calculated
that
if
every
seed
had
room
to
grow
for
three
successive
years
their
produce
would
cover
a
space
of
about
times
as
large
as
the
whole
land
surface
of
the
globe
some
of
the
minute
aquatic
forms
of
life
which
increase
by
division
in
a
few
hours
would
if
they
all
had
the
means
of
living
in
the
same
period
occupy
a
space
equal
to
that
of
the
entire
solar
system
even
the
largest
and
slowest
breeding
of
all
known
mammals
the
elephant
would
if
allowed
space
to
live
and
breed
freely
for
years
result
in
no
less
than
nineteen
million
animals
by
far
the
larger
part
of
the
criticisms
of
darwinism
by
popular
writers
are
due
to
their
continually
forgetting
these
two
great
natural
facts
enormous
about
a
of
every
part
and
organ
and
such
powers
of
multiplication
that
even
in
the
case
of
vertebrate
animals
of
those
born
every
year
only
a
small
to
or
over
the
second
year
if
they
all
lived
their
numbers
would
go
on
continually
increasing
which
we
know
is
not
the
case
hence
arises
what
has
been
termed
the
struggle
for
existence
resulting
in
the
survival
of
the
fittest
this
struggle
for
life
is
either
against
the
forces
of
inorganic
or
those
of
organic
nature
among
the
former
are
storms
floods
intense
cold
droughts
or
violent
blizzards
all
of
which
take
toll
of
the
weaker
or
less
wary
individuals
of
each
that
are
less
adapted
to
survive
such
conditions
in
judging
how
this
would
act
we
must
always
remember
the
enormous
scale
on
which
nature
works
and
that
although
now
and
then
a
few
of
the
weaker
individuals
may
live
and
a
few
of
the
stronger
be
killed
yet
when
we
deal
with
hundreds
of
millions
of
which
eighty
or
ninety
millions
inevitably
die
every
year
while
about
ten
or
twenty
millions
only
survive
it
is
impossible
to
believe
that
those
which
survive
not
one
year
only
but
year
after
year
throughout
the
whole
existence
of
each
species
are
not
on
the
average
better
adapted
to
the
complex
conditions
of
their
environment
than
those
which
succumb
to
it
it
is
a
mere
truism
that
the
exactly
the
same
thing
occurs
in
the
case
of
the
organic
environment
to
which
each
species
must
also
be
well
adapted
in
order
to
live
the
two
great
essentials
for
animal
existence
are
to
obtain
abundant
food
through
successive
years
and
to
be
able
to
escape
from
their
various
enemies
when
food
is
scarce
the
strongest
or
those
who
can
feed
quickest
and
digest
more
rapidly
or
those
that
can
detect
food
at
greater
distances
or
reach
it
more
quickly
will
have
the
advantage
enemies
are
escaped
by
strength
by
swiftness
by
acute
vision
by
wariness
or
by
colours
which
conceal
the
various
species
in
their
natural
surroundings
and
those
which
possess
these
or
any
other
advantages
will
in
the
long
run
survive
the
weaker
the
less
and
the
smaller
species
often
have
special
protection
such
as
nocturnal
habits
making
burrows
in
the
earth
possessing
poisonous
stings
or
fangs
being
covered
with
protective
armour
while
great
numbers
are
coloured
or
marked
so
as
exactly
to
correspond
with
their
surroundings
and
are
thus
concealed
from
their
chief
enemies
selection
or
survival
of
the
it
may
be
here
noted
that
the
term
natural
selection
which
has
often
been
misunderstood
was
suggested
to
darwin
by
the
way
in
which
almost
all
our
varieties
of
cultivated
plants
and
domestic
animals
have
been
obtained
from
wild
forms
continually
improved
for
many
generations
the
method
is
to
breed
large
quantities
and
always
preserve
or
select
the
best
in
each
generation
to
be
the
parents
of
the
next
this
method
carried
on
by
hundreds
of
farmers
gardeners
dog
horse
or
poultry
breeders
and
especially
by
has
resulted
in
all
those
useful
beautiful
and
even
wonderful
varieties
of
fruits
vegetables
and
flowers
and
hunters
greyhounds
spaniels
and
cows
which
give
large
quantities
of
the
richest
milk
and
sheep
with
the
greatest
quantity
and
finest
quality
of
wool
all
these
were
produced
gradually
for
the
special
purposes
of
mankind
but
a
similar
result
has
been
effected
by
nature
through
rapid
increase
great
variability
and
continual
destruction
of
all
the
individuals
less
adapted
to
the
conditions
of
their
special
environment
so
that
only
the
strongest
or
the
swiftest
the
or
the
most
wary
the
best
armed
with
teeth
horns
hoofs
or
claws
those
who
could
swim
best
or
those
that
protected
each
other
by
keeping
in
flocks
or
the
longest
and
tended
to
improve
still
further
the
next
generation
survival
of
the
fittest
was
suggested
by
herbert
spencer
as
best
describing
exactly
what
happens
and
it
is
a
most
useful
descriptive
term
which
should
always
be
kept
in
mind
when
discussing
or
investigating
the
process
by
which
the
infinitely
varied
and
beautiful
productions
of
nature
have
been
developed
there
is
really
not
one
single
part
or
organ
of
any
plant
or
animal
that
can
not
have
been
derived
by
means
of
the
fundamental
facts
of
variability
and
reproduction
from
some
allied
plant
or
animal
it
is
interesting
here
to
note
that
the
two
of
the
process
of
constant
adaptation
to
the
environment
by
great
variability
and
rapid
multiplication
formed
no
part
of
lamarck
theory
which
some
people
still
think
to
be
as
good
as
darwin
equally
suggestive
is
the
fact
that
while
extensive
groups
of
such
as
colour
weapons
hair
scales
and
feathers
can
hardly
be
conceived
as
having
been
produced
or
modified
by
or
by
the
direct
action
of
the
environment
they
are
yet
every
one
of
them
perfectly
explained
by
the
fundamental
and
necessary
processes
of
variability
and
survival
acting
slowly
and
continuously
but
with
intermittent
periods
of
extreme
activity
at
long
intervals
on
all
living
things
one
of
the
weakest
and
most
foolish
of
all
the
objections
to
the
darwinian
theory
is
that
it
does
not
explain
and
is
therefore
worthless
we
might
as
well
say
that
newton
discovery
of
the
laws
of
gravitation
was
worthless
because
its
was
not
and
has
not
yet
been
discovered
or
that
the
undulatory
theory
of
light
and
heat
is
worthless
because
the
origin
of
the
ether
the
thing
that
is
not
known
the
of
things
can
never
be
known
and
as
darwin
well
said
it
is
foolish
to
waste
time
in
speculation
about
them
i
think
i
have
shown
in
my
of
that
infinite
variability
is
a
basic
law
of
nature
and
have
suggested
its
probable
purpose
that
purpose
seems
to
have
been
the
development
of
a
culminating
in
being
capable
of
studying
and
enjoying
and
to
some
extent
comprehending
the
vast
universe
around
him
from
the
microscopic
life
in
almost
every
drop
of
water
to
the
whirling
nebulæ
of
the
glittering
extending
to
almost
unimaginable
distances
around
him
looking
at
him
thus
man
is
as
much
above
and
as
different
from
the
beasts
that
perish
as
they
are
above
and
beyond
the
inanimate
masses
of
meteoritic
matter
which
as
we
now
know
occupy
the
apparently
vacant
spaces
of
our
solar
system
and
from
which
comets
and
stars
are
in
all
probability
the
aggregations
due
to
the
action
of
the
various
cosmic
forces
which
everywhere
seem
capable
of
producing
variety
and
order
out
of
a
more
uniform
but
less
orderly
chaos
but
besides
this
lofty
intellect
man
is
gifted
with
what
we
term
a
moral
sense
an
insistent
perception
of
justice
and
injustice
of
right
and
wrong
of
order
and
beauty
and
truth
which
as
a
whole
constitute
his
moral
and
æsthetic
nature
the
origin
and
progress
of
which
i
have
endeavoured
to
throw
some
light
upon
in
the
present
volume
the
long
course
of
human
history
leads
us
to
the
conclusion
that
this
higher
nature
of
man
arose
at
some
far
distant
epoch
and
though
it
has
developed
in
various
directions
does
not
seem
yet
to
have
elevated
the
whole
race
much
above
its
earliest
condition
at
the
time
when
by
the
influx
of
some
portion
of
the
spirit
of
the
deity
man
became
a
living
soul
we
will
now
consider
some
of
the
changes
which
this
higher
nature
of
man
has
produced
in
the
action
of
the
laws
of
variation
and
natural
selection
these
are
very
important
and
are
so
little
understood
that
almost
all
popular
writers
on
the
subject
of
the
future
of
mankind
are
led
into
stating
as
scientific
conclusions
what
are
wholly
opposed
to
the
actual
teaching
of
evolution
chapter
xiv
selection
as
modified
by
mind
the
theory
of
natural
selection
as
expounded
by
darwin
was
so
completely
successful
in
explaining
the
origin
of
the
almost
infinitely
varied
forms
of
the
organic
world
step
by
step
during
the
long
succession
of
the
geological
ages
that
it
was
naturally
supposed
to
be
equally
applicable
to
mankind
this
was
thought
to
be
almost
certain
when
in
his
later
work
descent
of
darwin
proved
by
a
series
of
converging
facts
and
convincing
arguments
that
the
physical
structure
of
man
was
in
all
its
parts
and
organs
so
extremely
similar
to
that
of
the
anthropoid
apes
as
to
demonstrate
the
descent
of
both
from
some
common
ancestor
so
close
is
this
resemblance
that
every
bone
and
muscle
in
the
human
body
has
its
counterpart
in
that
of
the
apes
the
only
differences
being
slight
modifications
in
their
shape
and
position
yet
these
differences
lead
to
external
forms
attitudes
and
modes
of
life
so
divergent
that
we
can
hardly
recognise
the
close
affinity
that
really
exists
this
affinity
is
so
real
and
unmistakable
that
such
a
great
and
conservative
zoologist
as
the
late
sir
richard
owen
declared
that
to
discover
and
define
any
important
differences
between
them
was
the
anatomist
difficulty
it
was
in
the
dimensions
the
shape
and
the
proportions
of
the
brain
that
owen
found
a
sufficient
amount
of
distinctive
characters
to
enable
him
to
place
man
in
a
separate
order
of
or
the
remainder
of
the
whole
monkey
the
apes
baboons
monkeys
and
the
order
quadrumana
or
animals
this
classification
has
been
rejected
by
most
modern
biologists
who
consider
man
to
form
a
distinct
family
the
order
primates
which
order
includes
all
animals
as
well
as
man
but
if
we
recognise
the
brain
as
the
organ
of
the
mind
and
give
due
weight
to
the
complete
distinctness
and
enormous
superiority
of
the
mind
of
man
as
compared
with
that
of
all
other
mammals
we
shall
be
inclined
to
accept
owen
view
as
the
most
natural
and
this
becomes
almost
certain
when
we
realise
the
enormous
effect
his
mind
has
produced
in
modifying
and
almost
neutralising
the
action
of
that
great
law
of
natural
selection
which
has
held
supreme
sway
in
every
other
portion
of
the
organic
world
we
have
seen
in
the
preceding
chapter
how
every
form
of
organic
life
during
all
the
vast
extent
of
geological
time
has
been
subject
to
the
law
of
natural
selection
which
has
incessantly
moulded
their
bodily
form
and
structure
external
and
internal
in
strict
adaptation
to
the
successive
changes
of
the
world
around
them
while
that
world
was
itself
hardly
if
at
all
modified
by
them
a
few
isolated
as
the
formation
of
islands
by
the
zoophytes
or
the
damming
of
a
few
rivers
by
the
rude
though
very
remarkable
labours
of
the
hardly
be
considered
as
forming
exceptions
to
this
law
but
so
soon
as
man
appeared
upon
the
earth
even
in
the
earliest
periods
at
which
we
have
any
proofs
of
his
existence
or
in
the
lowest
state
of
barbarism
in
which
we
are
now
able
to
study
him
we
find
him
able
to
use
and
act
upon
the
forces
of
nature
and
to
modify
his
environment
both
inorganic
and
organic
in
ways
which
formed
a
completely
new
departure
in
the
entire
organic
world
among
the
very
rudest
of
modern
savages
the
wounded
or
the
sick
are
assisted
at
least
with
food
and
shelter
and
often
in
other
ways
so
that
they
recover
under
circumstances
that
to
most
of
the
higher
animals
would
be
fatal
neither
does
less
robust
health
or
vigour
or
even
the
loss
of
a
limb
or
of
eyesight
necessarily
entail
death
the
less
fit
are
therefore
not
eliminated
as
among
all
other
animals
and
we
behold
for
the
first
time
in
the
history
of
the
world
the
great
law
of
natural
selection
by
the
survival
only
of
the
fittest
to
some
extent
neutralised
but
this
is
only
the
first
and
least
important
of
the
effects
produced
by
the
superior
faculties
of
man
in
the
whole
animal
world
as
we
have
seen
every
species
is
preserved
in
harmony
with
the
slowly
changing
environment
by
modifications
of
its
own
organs
or
faculties
thus
gradually
leading
to
the
production
of
new
species
equally
adapted
to
the
new
environment
as
its
ancestor
was
before
the
change
occurred
in
the
case
of
man
however
such
bodily
adaptations
were
unnecessary
because
his
greatly
superior
mind
enabled
him
to
meet
all
such
difficulties
in
a
new
and
different
way
as
soon
as
his
specially
human
faculties
were
developed
and
we
have
as
yet
no
knowledge
of
him
in
any
earlier
condition
he
would
cease
to
be
influenced
by
natural
selection
in
his
physical
form
and
structure
looked
at
as
a
mere
animal
he
would
remain
almost
stationary
the
changes
in
the
surrounding
universe
ceasing
to
produce
in
him
that
powerful
modifying
effect
which
they
exercise
over
all
other
members
of
the
entire
organic
world
in
order
to
protect
himself
from
the
larger
and
fiercer
of
the
mammalia
he
made
use
of
weapons
such
as
clubs
wooden
spears
bows
and
arrows
and
various
kinds
of
traps
and
snares
all
of
which
are
exceedingly
effective
when
families
or
larger
groups
combine
in
their
use
against
the
severity
of
the
seasons
he
protected
himself
with
a
clothing
of
skins
and
with
some
form
of
shelter
or
house
in
which
he
could
rest
securely
at
night
free
from
tempestuous
rains
or
the
attacks
of
wild
beasts
by
the
use
of
fire
he
was
enabled
to
render
both
roots
and
flesh
more
palatable
and
more
digestible
thus
increasing
the
variety
and
abundance
of
his
food
far
beyond
that
of
any
species
of
the
lower
animals
yet
further
by
the
simplest
forms
of
cultivation
he
was
able
to
increase
the
best
of
the
fruits
the
roots
the
tubers
as
well
as
the
more
nutritious
of
the
seeds
such
as
those
of
rice
and
maize
of
wheat
and
of
barley
thus
securing
in
convenient
proximity
to
his
an
abundance
of
food
to
supply
all
his
wants
and
render
him
almost
always
secure
against
scarcity
or
famine
or
disastrous
droughts
we
see
then
that
with
the
advent
of
man
there
had
come
into
existence
a
being
in
whom
that
subtle
force
we
term
became
of
far
more
importance
than
mere
bodily
structure
though
with
a
naked
and
unprotected
body
gave
him
clothing
against
the
varied
inclemencies
of
the
seasons
though
unable
to
compete
with
the
deer
in
swiftness
or
with
the
wild
bull
in
strength
gave
him
weapons
with
which
to
capture
or
overcome
both
though
less
capable
than
most
other
animals
of
living
on
the
herbs
and
the
fruits
that
unaided
nature
supplies
this
wonderful
faculty
taught
him
to
govern
and
direct
nature
to
his
own
benefit
and
compelled
her
to
produce
food
for
him
almost
where
and
when
he
pleased
from
the
moment
when
the
first
skin
was
used
as
a
covering
when
the
first
rude
spear
was
formed
to
assist
him
in
the
chase
when
fire
was
first
used
to
cook
his
food
when
the
first
seed
was
sown
or
shoot
planted
a
grand
revolution
was
effected
in
revolution
which
in
all
previous
ages
of
the
earth
history
had
had
no
parallel
a
being
had
arisen
who
was
no
longer
subject
to
bodily
change
with
changes
of
the
physical
being
who
was
in
some
degree
superior
to
nature
inasmuch
as
he
knew
how
to
control
and
regulate
her
action
and
could
keep
himself
in
harmony
with
her
not
through
any
change
in
his
body
but
by
means
of
his
vast
superiority
in
mind
the
view
above
expounded
of
the
transference
of
the
action
of
natural
selection
from
the
bodily
structure
to
the
mind
of
early
man
was
my
first
original
modification
of
that
theory
having
been
communicated
to
the
in
it
received
the
approval
both
of
darwin
himself
and
of
herbert
spencer
and
i
am
not
aware
that
anyone
has
shown
any
flaw
in
the
reasoning
by
which
it
is
established
it
is
certainly
of
high
importance
since
if
true
it
renders
impossible
any
important
change
in
the
external
form
of
mankind
while
it
serves
as
an
explanation
of
the
complete
identity
of
specific
type
of
the
three
great
races
of
caucasian
or
white
the
mongolian
or
yellow
and
the
negroid
or
every
essential
of
human
form
and
structure
while
in
their
best
examples
they
approach
very
nearly
to
the
same
ideal
of
symmetry
and
of
beauty
yet
so
little
attention
has
been
given
to
this
view
that
most
popular
and
even
some
scientific
writers
take
it
for
granted
that
no
such
difference
exists
between
man
and
the
lower
animals
they
assume
that
we
are
destined
to
have
our
bodies
modified
in
the
remote
future
in
some
unknown
way
and
that
the
idea
that
there
is
anything
approaching
final
perfection
in
the
human
form
is
a
mere
figment
of
the
imagination
others
are
so
imbued
with
the
universality
of
natural
selection
as
a
beneficial
law
of
nature
that
they
object
to
our
interfering
with
its
action
in
as
they
urge
the
elimination
of
the
unfit
by
disease
and
death
even
when
such
diseases
are
caused
by
the
insanitary
conditions
of
our
modern
cities
or
the
misery
and
destitution
due
to
our
irrational
and
immoral
social
system
such
writers
entirely
ignore
the
undoubted
fact
that
affection
sympathy
compassion
form
as
essential
a
part
of
human
nature
as
do
the
higher
intellectual
and
moral
faculties
that
in
the
very
earliest
periods
of
history
and
among
the
very
lowest
of
existing
savages
they
are
fully
manifested
not
merely
between
the
members
of
the
same
family
but
throughout
the
whole
tribe
and
also
in
most
cases
to
every
stranger
who
is
not
a
known
or
imagined
enemy
the
earliest
book
of
travels
i
remember
hearing
read
by
my
father
was
that
of
mungo
park
one
of
the
first
explorers
of
the
niger
he
was
once
alone
and
sick
there
and
some
negro
women
nursed
him
fed
him
and
saved
his
life
and
while
lying
in
their
hut
he
heard
them
singing
about
him
as
the
poor
white
man
of
whom
they
said
he
has
no
mother
to
give
him
milk
no
wife
to
grind
his
corn
hospitality
is
in
fact
one
of
the
most
general
of
all
human
virtues
and
in
some
cases
is
almost
a
religion
it
is
an
inherent
part
of
what
constitutes
human
nature
and
it
is
directly
antagonistic
to
the
rigid
law
of
natural
selection
which
has
universally
prevailed
throughout
the
lower
animal
world
those
who
advocate
our
allowing
natural
selection
to
have
free
play
among
ourselves
on
the
ground
that
we
are
interfering
with
nature
are
totally
ignorant
of
what
they
are
talking
about
it
is
nature
herself
untaught
unsophisticated
nature
which
they
are
seeking
to
interfere
with
they
seek
to
degrade
the
higher
nature
to
the
level
of
the
lower
to
bring
down
humanity
in
its
essential
characteristics
only
a
little
lower
than
the
angels
to
the
infinitely
lower
level
of
the
beasts
that
perish
the
conclusion
reached
in
the
earlier
portion
of
this
volume
that
the
higher
intellectual
and
moral
nature
of
man
has
been
approximately
stationary
during
the
whole
period
of
human
history
and
that
the
cause
of
the
phenomenon
has
been
the
absence
of
any
selective
agency
adequate
to
increase
it
renders
it
necessary
to
give
some
further
explanation
as
to
the
probable
or
possible
origin
of
this
higher
nature
and
also
of
that
admirable
human
body
which
also
appears
to
have
reached
a
condition
of
permanent
stability
chapter
xv
the
laws
of
heredity
and
environment
in
dealing
with
the
great
problems
of
organic
development
there
is
probably
no
department
in
which
so
much
error
and
misconception
prevails
as
on
the
nature
and
limitations
of
heredity
these
misconceptions
not
only
pervade
most
popular
writings
on
the
subject
of
evolution
but
even
those
of
men
of
science
and
of
specialists
in
biology
and
they
are
the
more
important
and
dangerous
because
their
promulgators
are
able
to
quote
herbert
spencer
and
to
a
less
extent
darwin
as
holding
similar
views
the
subject
is
of
special
importance
here
because
it
involves
the
question
of
whether
the
effects
of
the
environment
including
education
and
training
are
in
any
degree
transmitted
from
the
individuals
so
modified
to
their
they
are
or
are
not
cumulative
it
is
in
fact
the
much
discussed
and
vitally
important
problem
of
the
heredity
of
acquired
characters
the
effects
of
use
and
disuse
another
form
of
the
same
general
phenomenon
were
assumed
by
lamarck
to
be
inherited
and
a
large
portion
of
his
theory
of
evolution
rested
on
this
assumption
it
seemed
so
probable
and
was
apparently
supported
by
so
many
facts
that
darwin
like
most
other
naturalists
at
the
time
accepted
it
without
any
special
inquiry
and
when
he
worked
out
his
theory
of
pangenesis
in
order
to
explain
the
main
facts
of
heredity
his
suppositions
were
adapted
to
include
such
phenomena
let
us
then
first
explain
what
is
meant
by
the
acquired
characters
which
it
was
thought
that
a
true
theory
of
heredity
must
explain
as
a
rule
the
great
majority
of
the
peculiarities
of
any
species
of
animal
or
plant
are
constantly
reproduced
in
its
offspring
the
short
tail
of
the
wren
the
much
longer
tail
of
the
tit
the
crest
of
the
crested
tit
and
of
innumerable
other
birds
always
when
exhibit
the
same
characters
as
in
their
parents
these
are
said
to
be
characters
in
rare
cases
however
offspring
are
born
which
differ
materially
from
their
parents
as
when
a
white
blackbird
or
a
kitten
appears
but
these
are
equally
and
are
often
strongly
inherited
all
these
are
subject
to
variation
and
can
therefore
be
modified
by
selection
whether
natural
or
artificial
and
the
effects
of
such
selection
in
the
case
of
domestic
animals
is
often
enormous
such
are
the
pouters
and
tumblers
among
pigeons
the
and
the
greyhound
the
numerous
breeds
of
poultry
all
of
which
are
known
to
have
been
produced
by
artificial
selections
of
favourable
variations
extending
over
many
centuries
and
the
characters
of
these
varieties
are
all
strongly
inherited
characters
which
are
acquired
during
the
life
of
the
individual
owing
to
differences
in
the
use
of
certain
organs
or
of
exposure
to
light
heat
drought
wind
moisture
are
comparatively
very
slight
and
are
liable
to
be
so
combined
with
characters
and
with
the
effects
of
natural
or
artificial
selection
that
it
is
exceedingly
difficult
to
ascertain
without
such
careful
and
experiments
as
have
not
yet
been
made
whether
they
are
in
any
degree
transmissible
from
parent
to
offspring
and
therefore
cumulative
almost
every
individual
case
of
supposed
inheritance
of
such
characters
when
carefully
examined
has
been
found
to
be
explicable
in
other
ways
but
there
is
a
very
large
amount
of
evidence
demonstrating
that
even
if
a
certain
small
amount
of
such
inheritance
exists
it
can
certainly
not
be
a
factor
of
any
importance
in
the
process
of
organic
evolution
all
the
factors
of
which
must
be
universally
present
because
the
process
itself
is
universal
i
will
therefore
here
limit
myself
to
a
short
enumeration
of
a
few
of
the
very
numerous
cases
in
which
the
continued
use
of
an
organ
does
not
strengthen
or
improve
it
but
often
the
reverse
and
of
others
in
which
it
can
not
be
asserted
that
the
action
of
the
environment
can
have
had
any
part
whatever
in
the
continuous
change
or
specialisation
of
the
part
or
organ
the
number
size
form
position
and
composition
of
the
teeth
of
all
the
mammalia
are
extremely
varied
and
throughout
the
whole
class
afford
the
best
characters
to
distinguish
family
and
generic
groups
they
are
therefore
of
great
value
in
determining
the
affinities
of
extinct
forms
because
the
jaws
and
teeth
especially
the
latter
are
most
frequently
preserved
but
as
the
permanent
teeth
are
always
fully
formed
while
buried
in
the
jawbones
and
covered
by
the
gums
it
is
quite
certain
that
the
special
adaptation
of
the
teeth
of
each
species
to
seize
crush
tear
or
grind
up
its
particular
food
can
not
possibly
have
been
produced
by
the
act
of
feeding
the
effect
of
which
is
almost
always
to
grind
away
the
teeth
and
render
them
less
serviceable
such
adaptation
could
not
possibly
have
been
produced
by
alone
or
any
other
direct
action
of
the
environment
yet
as
the
adaptation
is
clear
and
often
very
remarkable
some
eminent
palæontologists
have
declared
it
to
be
proved
that
the
changes
in
them
were
by
the
changes
in
the
environment
and
that
they
constitute
very
strong
evidence
of
the
inheritance
of
acquired
characters
statement
unsupported
by
any
direct
evidence
the
same
objection
applies
to
most
of
the
special
organs
of
sense
the
internal
organ
of
hearing
is
a
highly
complex
series
of
bones
and
membranes
protected
by
the
outer
ear
but
it
can
not
be
even
imagined
to
have
been
gradually
developed
by
the
action
of
the
air
waves
the
vibrations
of
which
it
conveys
to
the
brain
the
eye
is
a
still
more
striking
case
as
too
much
use
injures
or
even
destroys
it
while
specialities
of
vision
as
long
or
short
sight
are
undoubtedly
and
usually
persist
throughout
life
so
the
wonderfully
varied
bills
of
birds
can
not
be
conceived
as
having
been
modified
by
use
and
are
in
fact
unchangeable
when
once
formed
yet
as
they
vary
largely
in
every
species
they
are
readily
modified
so
as
to
become
adapted
to
new
conditions
by
the
survival
of
the
fittest
equally
impossible
is
it
to
connect
any
use
or
disuse
or
environmental
action
in
the
production
the
gradual

the
facts
presented

of

massive

of
the

and

the
widely
different

equalling
or
perhaps
surpassing
the

all
utterly
beyond

possible
direct
action
of
the

or
of

and
disuse
in

and
their
close
adaptation
to
that

organic
nature
is
indisputably
one
and
indivisible
it
has
been
developed
throughout
by
means
of
the
fundamental
of
life
of
growth
and
reproduction
and
the
equally
fundamental
of
variation
heredity
and
enormous
increase
resulting
in
a
perpetual
adaptation
in
form
structure
colour
and
habits
to
the
slowly
changing
environment
these
forces
and
laws
are
in
their
action
they
are
demonstrably
adequate
to
the
production
of
the
whole
of
the
phenomena
we
are
now
discussing
we
see
then
that
over
by
far
the
greater
part
of
the
whole
world
of
life
any
modification
of
external
structure
form
or
colouring
during
the
life
of
the
individual
is
impossible
while
in
the
remainder
its
action
if
it
exists
at
all
is
of
very
limited
range
no
adequate
of
the
inheritance
of
the
slight
changes
thus
caused
has
ever
yet
been
given
and
it
is
therefore
wholly
unnecessary
and
illogical
to
assume
its
existence
and
to
adduce
it
as
having
any
part
in
the
and
universal
process
of
evolution
throughout
the
whole
series
of
the
animal
world
and
especially
in
the
higher
groups
which
approach
nearest
to
ourselves
mental
and
physical
characters
are
so
inextricably
intermixed
in
their
relation
to
the
laws
of
evolution
and
heredity
that
either
of
them
studied
separately
leads
us
to
the
same
conclusions
we
are
not
therefore
surprised
to
find
that
breeders
of
animals
of
all
kinds
act
upon
the
principle
that
all
the
qualities
of
the
various
stocks
whether
bodily
or
mental
are
and
have
been
due
to
selection
while
training
though
necessary
to
bring
out
the
good
qualities
of
the
individual
has
had
no
part
in
the
of
those
qualities
when
a
horse
or
dog
of
good
pedigree
is
accidentally
injured
so
that
it
can
not
be
regularly
trained
it
is
still
used
for
breeding
purposes
without
any
doubt
as
to
its
conveying
to
its
progeny
the
highest
qualities
of
its
parentage
in
the
case
of
the
human
race
however
many
writers
thoughtlessly
speak
of
the
hereditary
effects
of
strength
or
skill
due
to
any
mechanical
work
or
special
art
being
continued
generation
after
generation
in
the
same
family
as
among
the
castes
of
india
but
of
any
progressive
improvement
there
is
no
evidence
whatever
those
children
who
had
a
natural
aptitude
for
the
work
would
of
course
form
the
successors
of
their
parents
and
there
is
no
proof
of
anything
hereditary
except
as
regards
this
aptitude
many
people
are
alarmed
at
the
statement
that
the
effects
of
education
and
training
are
hereditary
and
think
that
if
that
were
really
the
case
there
would
be
no
hope
of
improvement
of
the
race
but
closer
consideration
will
show
them
that
if
the
results
of
our
education
in
the
widest
sense
in
the
home
in
the
shop
in
the
nation
and
in
the
world
at
large
had
really
been
hereditary
even
in
the
slightest
degree
then
indeed
there
would
be
little
hope
for
humanity
and
there
is
no
clearer
proof
of
this
than
the
fact
that
we
have
not
been
made
much
wonder
being
that
any
fragment
of
morality
or
humanity
or
the
love
of
truth
or
justice
for
their
own
sakes
still
exists
among
us
if
we
glance
through
the
past
history
of
mankind
we
see
an
almost
unbroken
succession
of
aggression
and
combat
between
the
various
races
nations
and
tribes
we
can
dimly
see
that
this
continual
struggle
did
lead
to
a
rather
severe
process
of
selection
as
in
the
lower
animal
world
it
can
hardly
be
doubted
that
as
a
result
of
these
struggles
the
strongest
physically
the
most
ingenious
in
the
use
of
weapons
and
the
best
organised
for
war
did
survive
and
that
the
weaker
and
lower
were
either
exterminated
or
kept
as
slaves
by
the
conquerors
this
leads
to
alternation
of
success
and
failure
we
see
great
conquerors
and
great
material
civilisations
as
a
result
of
their
accumulations
of
wealth
and
of
slaves
then
for
a
time
luxury
and
the
arts
flourished
and
with
them
came
rulers
who
encouraged
degradation
and
vice
at
home
supported
by
more
and
more
remote
conquests
then
new
conquerors
arose
often
lower
in
as
they
were
higher
in
the
simple
domestic
virtues
and
a
more
natural
life
of
productive
labour
these
again
or
some
portions
of
them
rose
to
luxury
and
civilisation
to
lives
of
gross
sensuality
and
the
most
cruel
despotism
till
outraged
humanity
raised
up
new
conquerors
to
go
over
again
the
old
terrible
routine
the
periods
of
culmination
of
these
old
civilisations
founded
always
on
conquest
massacre
and
slavery
are
marked
out
for
us
by
the
ruins
of
great
cities
temples
and
palaces
often
of
wonderful
grandeur
and
with
indications
of
arts
science
and
literature
which
still
excite
our
admiration
in
egypt
and
india
greece
and
rome
and
thence
through
the
middle
ages
down
to
our
own
time
but
the
inhumanities
and
horrors
of
these
periods
are
inconceivable
a
gloomy
picture
of
them
is
given
in
that
powerful
book
martyrdom
of
by
winwood
reade
and
they
are
summarised
in
burns
fine
lines
man
inhumanity
to
man
makes
countless
thousands
mourn
think
of
the
horrors
of
war
in
the
perpetual
wars
of
those
days
before
the
red
cross
service
did
anything
to
alleviate
them
think
of
the
old
castles
many
of
which
had
besides
the
dungeons
a
salaried
torturer
and
executioner
think
of
the
systematic
tortures
of
the
centuries
of
the
witchcraft
mania
and
of
the
inquisition
think
of
the
burnings
in
smithfield
and
in
every
great
city
of
europe
think
of
truth
for
ever
on
the
scaffold
wrong
for
ever
on
the
throne
freedom
of
speech
even
of
thought
were
everywhere
crimes
how
then
did
the
love
of
truth
survive
as
an
ideal
of
to
escape
these
horrors
the
gentle
the
good
the
learned
and
the
peaceful
had
to
seek
refuge
in
monasteries
and
nunneries
while
by
means
of
the
celibacy
of
the
clergy
the
church
as
galton
tells
us
by
a
policy
singularly
unwise
and
suicidal
brutalised
the
breed
of
our
forefathers
here
was
the
actual
of
the
world
as
man
rose
from
barbarism
to
civilisation
and
it
was
accompanied
by
a
certain
amount
of
retrograde
selection
by
the
cruel
punishments
confinement
in
dungeons
or
torture
and
death
of
those
who
opposed
the
rulers
and
by
the
survival
of
the
worst
tools
of
the
lords
and
tyrants
ought
we
not
to
be
thankful
that
such
education
and
custom
the
varied
influences
of
such
an
environment
hereditary
and
is
not
the
fact
that
the
whole
world
has
become
utterly
degraded
and
that
anything
good
remains
in
our
cruelly
oppressed
human
nature
an
overwhelming
proof
that
such
influences
hereditary
when
we
remember
that
many
of
these
degrading
laws
and
customs
oppressions
and
punishments
have
extended
down
to
our
own
times
that
the
terrible
and
the
equally
terrible
slavery
have
only
been
abolished
within
the
memory
of
many
of
us
and
that
the
system
of
the
distinction
of
classes
the
gross
inequality
of
the
law
the
overwork
of
our
labouring
millions
the
immoral
luxury
and
idleness
of
our
thousands
while
far
more
thousands
die
annually
of
want
of
the
bare
necessaries
of
life
that
millions
have
their
lives
shortened
by
easily
preventable
causes
while
other
millions
pass
their
whole
lives
in
continuous
and
almost
inhuman
labour
in
order
to
provide
means
for
the
enjoyments
and
pernicious
luxuries
of
the
must
be
amazed
at
the
fact
that
there
is
nevertheless
so
much
real
goodness
real
humanity
among
us
as
certainly
exists
in
spite
of
all
the
degrading
influences
that
i
have
been
compelled
here
to
enumerate
to
myself
there
seems
only
one
explanation
of
the
very
remarkable
and
almost
incredible
result
just
stated
it
is
that
the
divine
nature
in
portion
of
our
higher
nature
which
raises
us
above
the
brutes
and
the
influx
of
which
makes
us
can
not
be
lost
can
not
even
be
permanently
deteriorated
by
conditions
however
adverse
by
training
however
senseless
and
bad
it
ever
remains
in
us
the
central
and
essential
portion
of
our
nature
ready
to
respond
to
every
favourable
opportunity
that
arises
to
grasp
and
hold
firm
every
fragment
of
high
thought
or
noble
action
that
has
been
brought
to
its
notice
to
oppose
even
to
the
death
every
falsehood
in
teaching
every
tyranny
in
action
the
ethics
of
plato
and
of
the
great
moralists
of
the
ciceronian
epoch
together
with
those
of
jesus
and
of
his
disciples
and
followers
kept
alive
the
sacred
flame
of
pure
humanity
and
their
preservation
constitutes
perhaps
the
greatest
service
the
monastic
system
rendered
to
the
human
race
this
service
is
finely
expressed
by
an
almost
unknown
poet
dell
in
the
prefatory
to
his
volume
dawning
never
has
our
indebtedness
to
the
classical
writers
been
more
powerfully
insisted
on
than
in
the
following
lines
hear
ye
not
the
measured
footfalls
echoing
solemn
and
sublime
from
the
groves
of
academus
down
the
avenues
of

thou
not
the
giant
figures
of
the
sages
of
the
past
through
the
darken
long
perspective
on
the
living
foreground
cast
thou
not
the
thrilling
rhythm
of
the
grand
old
grecian
line
pulsing
to
the
march
of
progress
cadencing
her
hymn
divine
all
the
forces
of
the
present
by
the
subtle
sparks
controlled
of
the
quickening
grecian
fire
of
the
mighty
lights
of
old
through
the
dark
and
desolation
of
the

note
on

if
the
christian
church
had
done
nothing
for
us
but
preserve
in
its
monasteries
and
abbeys
the
finest
examples
of
classic
literature
that
have
come
down
to
us
and
given
us
those
glories
of
gothic
architecture
which
seem
to
express
in
stone
the
grandeur
and
sublimity
the
peacefulness
and
the
beauty
of
a
pure
religion
it
would
notwithstanding
its
many
defects
its
cruelty
and
oppression
its
opposition
to
the
study
of
nature
and
to
freedom
of
thought
have
fully
justified
its
existence
as
helping
us
to
realise
whatever
more
advanced
and
purer
civilisation
the
immediate
future
may
have
in
store
for
us
light
on
the
problem
of
before
passing
on
to
another
branch
of
my
subject
i
feel
it
necessary
to
make
a
few
suggestions
in
reply
to
the
objection
that
will
certainly
and
very
properly
be
made
as
to
why
if
our
higher
human
nature
is
in
its
essence
divine
it
has
suffered
such
long
and
terrible
has
the
lower
so
often
and
for
so
long
prevailed
over
the
higher
this
is
of
course
one
of
the
many
forms
of
the
old
problem
of
the
origin
of
evil
which
is
no
doubt
insoluble
by
us
but
as
it
is
a
fairly
and
limited
portion
of
that
problem
it
may
be
possible
to
obtain
some
idea
of
a
possible
solution
and
as
such
an
one
has
occurred
to
myself
during
the
composition
of
the
present
volume
i
will
give
it
as
briefly
as
possible
in
the
hope
that
it
may
interest
some
of
my
readers
in
my
recent
works
place
in
the
and
world
of
the
conclusion
was
forced
upon
me
that
the
scheme
of
the
development
of
the
universe
of
stars
and
nebulæ
with
which
we
are
acquainted
and
especially
of
our
sun
and
solar
system
was
such
as
to
furnish
the
exact
conditions
on
our
earth
and
there
only
which
should
allow
of
the
origin
and
evolution
of
the
organic
world
culminating
in
man
yet
further
that
the
conditions
should
be
such
as
to
produce
the
maximum
of
diversity
both
of
inorganic
and
organic
products
useful
to
man
and
such
as
would
aid
in
the
development
of
the
greatest
possible
diversity
of
character
and
especially
of
his
higher
mental
and
moral
nature
what
i
have
here
termed
the
divine
influx
which
at
some
definite
epoch
in
his
evolution
at
once
raised
man
above
the
rest
of
the
animals
creating
as
it
were
a
new
being
with
a
continuous
spiritual
existence
in
a
world
or
worlds
where
eternal
progress
was
possible
for
him
to
prepare
him
for
this
progress
with
diversity
faculties
of
enormous
range
were
required
and
these
needed
development
in
every
direction
which
earthly
conditions
rendered
possible
in
order
that
this
extreme
diversity
of
character
should
be
brought
about
a
great
space
of
time
as
measured
by
successive
generations
was
necessary
though
utterly
insignificant
as
compared
with
the
preceding
duration
of
organic
life
on
the
earth
and
still
more
insignificant
as
compared
with
the
to
succeed
it
it
is
for
this
purpose
perhaps
that
languages
become
so
rapidly
diverse
and
mutually
unintelligible
after
a
moderate
period
of
isolation
binding
together
small
or
moderate
communities
in
distinct
tribes
or
nations
which
each
develop
in
their
own
way
under
the
influence
of
special
physical
surroundings
and
originate
peculiarities
of
habits
customs
and
modes
of
thought
antagonisms
soon
arise
between
adjacent
tribes
leading
each
to
protect
itself
against
others
by
means
of
chiefs
and
some
combinations
this
requires
organisation
and
foresight
and
after
a
time
the
most
powerful
conquers
the
weaker
they
intermingle
and
still
greater
diversity
arises
by
this
constant
struggle
the
less
advanced
suffer
most
and
the
race
as
a
whole
takes
a
step
forward
in
the
march
of
civilisation
we
see
the
best
example
of
this
mode
of
progress
by
antagonism
in
the
small
states
of
ancient
greece
where
each
little
kingdom
developed
its
peculiar
form
of
art
of
government
and
of
civilisation
which
it
transferred
to
all
parts
of
europe
and
after
two
thousand
years
of
degradation
by
roman
and
turkish
conquest
its
language
still
remains
but
little
altered
while
its
ancient
literature
and
art
are
still
unsurpassed
in
like
manner
rome
brought
law
literature
and
military
discipline
to
an
equally
high
level
and
it
too
sank
into
a
state
of
ruin
and
degradation
while
its
literature
and
its
law
continued
to
illuminate
the
civilised
world
during
its
long
struggle
towards
freedom
wherever
conditions
were
favourable
to
progress
in
art
or
science
was
needed
for
its
full
growth
and
development
while
perpetual
war
necessitated
organisation
and
training
against
conquest
or
destruction
even
the
cruelties
and
massacres
by
despotic
rulers
excited
at
last
the
uprising
of
the
oppressed
and
so
developed
the
nobler
attributes
of
patriotism
courage
and
love
of
freedom
in
the
very
worst
of
times
there
was
an
undercurrent
of
peaceful
labour
art
and
learning
slowly
moulding
nations
towards
a
higher
state
of
civilisation
the
point
of
view
now
suggested
will
perhaps
be
rendered
somewhat
more
intelligible
if
we
apply
it
to
the
nineteenth
century
of
which
i
have
written
in
such
condemnatory
terms
the
preceding
eighteenth
century
was
undoubtedly
a
somewhat
stationary
epoch
of
a
rather
commonplace
character
alike
in
literature
in
art
in
science
and
in
social
life
its
vices
also
were
low
its
government
bad
its
system
of
punishments
cruel
and
its
recognition
of
slavery
degrading
it
was
a
kind
of
dark
age
between
the
literary
and
national
brilliance
of
the
elizabethan
age
and
the
wonderful
scientific
and
industrial
advance
of
the
victorian
age
but
this
latter
period
was
also
a
period
of
a
great
uprising
of
the
specially
human
virtues
of
justice
of
pity
of
the
love
of
freedom
and
of
the
importance
of
education
and
though
the
rapid
increase
of
wealth
through
the
utilisation
of
natural
forces
led
to
all
the
evils
due
to
the
unchecked
growth
of
individual
riches
and
power
yet
these
very
evils
in
all
their
intensity
and
horror
were
perhaps
necessary
to
excite
in
a
sufficient
number
of
minds
the
determination
to
get
rid
of

time
was
also
required
for
the
workers
to
learn
their
own
power
and
very
gradually
to
learn
how
to
use
it
the
and
of
the
early
part
of
the
century
have
been
succeeded
by
combination
and
strikes
step
by
step
political
power
has
been
gained
by
the
masses
but
only
now
in
the
twentieth
century
are
they
beginning
to
learn
how
to
use
their
strength
in
an
effective
manner
there
are
however
indications
that
the
whole
march
of
progress
has
been
dangerously
rapid
and
it
have
been
safer
if
the
great
increases
of
knowledge
and
the
vast
accumulations
of
wealth
had
been
spread
over
two
centuries
instead
of
one
in
that
case
our
higher
nature
might
have
been
able
to
keep
pace
with
the
growing
evils
of
superfluous
wealth
and
increasing
luxury
and
it
might
have
been
possible
to
put
a
check
upon
them
before
they
had
attained
the
full
power
for
evil
they
now
possess
nevertheless
the
omens
for
the
future
are
good
the
great
body
of
the
more
intelligent
workers
are
determined
to
have
justice
they
insist
upon
the
abolition
of
monopolies
of
the
forces
of
nature
and
upon
the
gradual
admission
of
all
to
for
labour
by
free
access
to
their
native
soil
thus
may
be
initiated

birth
of
a
new

moral
progress
through
a
new
form
of
selection
many
readers
and
some
writers
of
books
on
organic
evolution
seem
quite
unaware
that
darwin
established
two
modes
of
selection
both
alike
natural
but
acting
in
different
ways
and
producing
somewhat
different
results
he
termed
the
second
mode
sexual
selection
and
in
his
of
he
briefly
describes
it
as
consisting
in
the
fighting
of
males
for
the
possession
of
females
which
undoubtedly
occurs
in
numbers
of
the
higher
vertebrates
and
also
in
insects
but
he
also
includes
under
sexual
selection
another
mode
of
rivalry
by
the
display
of
the
special
male
ornaments
of
many
birds
and
the
choice
of
the
more
ornamental
by
the
females
to
this
latter
phase
he
devotes
nearly
half
his
volume
on
descent
of
man
and
on
selection
in
relation
to
selection
by
the
fighting
of
males
has
led
to
the
development
of
the
stag
antlers
the
boar
tusks
and
the
mane
serving
as
a
shield
these
combats
rarely
lead
to
the
death
of
the
vanquished
but
to
a
larger
number
of
offspring
for
the
victor
and
this
leads
to
the
improvement
of
the
race
by
keeping
up
its
strength
vigour
and
fighting
power
the
other
form
of
selection
by
the
display
of
ornaments
by
male
birds
and
the
supposed
continuous
development
of
those
ornaments
by
the
appreciative
choice
of
the
females
i
believe
to
be
imaginary
i
have
discussed
this
subject
in
many
of
my
books
and
my
views
are
now
generally
adopted
by
evolutionists
the
fact
that
the
colours
of
male
insects
especially
butterflies
are
almost
exactly
parallel
to
those
of
birds
first
led
me
to
this
conclusion
because
we
can
hardly
suppose
insects
to
be
endowed
with
any
æsthetic
sense
even
if
they
really
colour
at
all
which
in
my
last
book
i
have
given
strong
reasons
for
doubting
but
in
the
human
race
the
conditions
are
altogether
different
for
while
as
i
have
shown
in
chapter
the
kind
of
natural
selection
which
through
all
the
ages
had
moulded
the
infinitely
varied
animal
forms
into
harmony
with
their
environment
ceased
to
act
upon
man
body
and
only
for
a
limited
time
upon
his
lower
mental
faculties
sexual
selection
tended
to
act
if
at
all
prejudicially
through
polygamy
prostitution
and
slavery
though
it
possesses
the
potentiality
of
acting
in
the
future
so
as
to
ensure
intellectual
and
moral
progress
and
thus
elevate
the
race
to
whatever
degree
of
civilisation
and
it
is
capable
of
reaching
in
or
race
improvement
through
the
total
cessation
of
the
action
of
natural
selection
as
a
cause
of
improvement
in
our
race
either
physical
or
mental
led
to
the
proposal
of
the
late
sir
galton
to
establish
a
new
science
which
he
termed
eugenics
a
society
has
been
formed
and
much
is
being
written
about
checking
degeneration
and
elevating
the
race
to
a
higher
level
by
its
means
sir
galton
own
proposals
were
limited
to
giving
prizes
or
endowments
for
the
marriage
of
persons
of
high
character
both
physical
mental
and
moral
to
be
determined
by
some
form
of
inquiry
or
examination
this
may
perhaps
not
do
much
harm
but
it
would
certainly
do
very
little
good
its
range
of
action
would
be
extremely
limited
and
so
far
as
it
induced
any
couples
to
marry
each
other
for
the
pecuniary
reward
it
would
be
absolutely
immoral
in
its
nature
and
probably
result
in
no
perceptible
improvement
of
the
race
but
there
is
great
danger
in
such
a
process
of
artificial
selection
by
experts
who
would
certainly
soon
adopt
methods
very
different
from
those
of
the
founder
we
have
already
had
proposals
made
for
the
segregation
of
the
while
the
sterilization
of
the
unfit
and
of
some
classes
of
criminals
is
already
being
discussed
this
might
soon
be
extended
to
the
destruction
of
deformed
infants
as
was
actually
proposed
by
the
late
grant
allen
while
hiram
stanley
in
a
work
on
civilisation
and
the
marriage
proposed
more
measures
he
says
the
drunkard
the
criminal
the
diseased
the
morally
weak
should
never
come
into
society
not
reform
but
prevention
should
be
the
cry
and
he
hints
at
the
methods
he
would
adopt
in
the
following
passages
in
the
true
golden
age
which
lies
not
behind
but
before
us
the
privilege
of
parentage
will
be
esteemed
an
honour
for
the
comparatively
few
and
no
child
will
be
born
who
is
not
only
sound
in
body
and
mind
but
also
above
the
average
as
to
natural
ability
and
moral
force
and
he
concludes
the
most
important
matter
in
society
the
inherent
quality
of
the
members
of
which
it
is
composed
should
be
regulated
by
trained
specialists
of
course
our
modern
eugenists
will
disclaim
any
wish
to
adopt
such
measures
as
are
here
hinted
at
which
are
in
every
way
dangerous
and
detestable
but
i
protest
strenuously
against
any
direct
interference
with
the
freedom
of
marriage
which
as
i
shall
show
is
not
only
totally
unnecessary
but
would
be
a
much
greater
source
of
danger
to
morals
and
to
the
of
humanity
than
the
mere
temporary
evils
it
seeks
to
cure
i
trust
that
all
my
readers
will
oppose
any
on
this
subject
by
a
chance
body
of
elected
persons
who
are
totally
unfitted
to
deal
with
far
less
complex
problems
than
this
one
and
as
to
which
they
are
sure
to
bungle
disastrously
it
is
in
the
highest
degree
presumptuous
and
irrational
to
attempt
to
deal
by
compulsory
enactments
with
the
most
vital
and
most
sacred
of
all
human
relations
regardless
of
the
fact
that
our
present
phase
of
social
development
is
not
only
extremely
imperfect
but
as
i
have
already
shown
vicious
and
rotten
at
the
core
how
can
it
be
possible
to
determine
by
legislation
those
relations
of
the
sexes
which
shall
be
best
alike
for
individuals
and
for
the
race
in
a
society
in
which
a
large
proportion
of
our
women
are
forced
to
work
long
hours
daily
for
the
barest
subsistence
with
an
almost
total
absence
of
the
rational
pleasures
of
life
for
the
want
of
which
thousands
are
driven
into
wholly
uncongenial
marriages
in
order
to
secure
some
amount
of
personal
independence
or
physical
let
anyone
consider
on
the
one
hand
the
lives
of
the
wealthy
as
portrayed
in
the
society
newspapers
of
the
day
with
their
endless
round
of
pleasure
and
luxury
their
almost
inconceivable
wastefulness
and
extravagance
indicated
by
the
cost
of
female
dress
and
the
fact
of
a
thousand
pounds
or
more
being
expended
on
the
flowers
for
a
single
entertainment
on
the
other
hand
let
him
contemplate
the
awful
lives
of
millions
of
workers
so
miserably
paid
and
with
such
uncertainty
of
work
that
many
thousands
of
the
women
and
young
girls
are
driven
on
the
streets
as
the
only
means
of
breaking
the
monotony
of
their
unceasing
labour
and
obtaining
some
taste
of
the
enjoyments
of
life
at
whatever
cost
and
then
ask
himself
if
the
legislature
which
can
not
remedy
state
of
things
should
venture
to
meddle
with
the
great
problems
of
marriage
and
the
sanctities
of
family
life
is
it
not
a
hideous
mockery
that
the
successive
governments
which
for
forty
years
have
seen
the
people
they
profess
to
govern
so
driven
to
despair
by
the
vile
conditions
of
their
existence
that
in
an
ever
larger
and
larger
proportion
they
seek
death
by
suicide
as
their
only
means
of
governments
which
have
done
nothing
to
put
an
end
to
this
continuous
horror
of
starvation
and
suicide
should
be
thought
capable
of
remedying
some
of
its
more
terrible
while
leaving
its
absolutely
untouched
it
is
my
firm
conviction
for
reasons
i
shall
give
farther
on
that
when
we
have
cleansed
the
augean
stable
of
our
present
social
organisation
and
have
made
such
arrangements
that
shall
contribute
their
share
either
of
physical
or
mental
labour
and
that
every
one
shall
obtain
the
full
and
equal
reward
for
their
work
the
future
progress
of
the
race
will
be
rendered
certain
by
the
fuller
development
of
its
higher
nature
acted
on
by
a
special
form
of
selection
which
will
then
come
into
play
when
men
and
women
are
for
the
first
time
in
the
course
of
civilisation
alike
free
to
follow
their
best
impulses
when
idleness
and
vicious
or
hurtful
luxury
on
the
one
hand
oppressive
labour
and
the
dread
of
starvation
on
the
other
are
alike
unknown
when
receive
the
best
and
broadest
education
that
the
state
of
civilisation
and
knowledge
will
admit
when
the
standard
of
public
opinion
is
set
by
the
wisest
and
the
best
among
us
and
that
standard
is
systematically
inculcated
on
the
young
then
we
shall
find
that
a
system
of
selection
will
come
spontaneously
into
action
which
will
steadily
tend
to
eliminate
the
lower
the
less
developed
or
in
any
way
defective
types
of
men
and
will
thus
continuously
raise
the
physical
moral
and
intellectual
standard
of
the
race
the
exact
mode
in
which
this
selection
will
operate
will
now
be
briefly
explained
selection
in
it
will
be
generally
admitted
that
although
many
women
now
remain
unmarried
from
necessity
rather
than
from
choice
there
are
always
considerable
numbers
who
feel
no
strong
impulse
to
marriage
and
accept
husbands
to
secure
subsistence
and
a
home
of
their
own
rather
than
from
personal
affection
or
strong
sexual
emotion
in
a
state
of
society
in
which
all
women
were
economically
independent
were
all
fully
occupied
with
public
duties
and
social
or
intellectual
pleasures
and
had
nothing
to
gain
by
marriage
as
regards
material
or
social
position
it
is
highly
probable
that
the
numbers
of
the
unmarried
from
choice
would
increase
it
would
probably
come
to
be
considered
a
degradation
for
any
woman
to
marry
a
man
whom
she
could
not
love
and
esteem
and
this
reason
would
tend
at
least
to
delay
marriage
till
a
worthy
and
sympathetic
partner
was
encountered
in
man
on
the
other
hand
the
passion
of
love
is
more
general
and
usually
stronger
and
in
such
a
society
as
here
postulated
there
would
be
no
way
of
gratifying
this
passion
but
by
marriage
every
woman
therefore
would
be
likely
to
receive
offers
and
a
powerful
selective
agency
would
rest
with
the
female
sex
under
the
system
of
education
and
public
opinion
here
supposed
there
can
be
little
doubt
how
this
selection
would
be
exercised
the
idle
or
the
utterly
selfish
would
be
almost
universally
rejected
the
chronically
diseased
or
the
weak
in
intellect
would
also
usually
remain
unmarried
at
least
till
an
advanced
period
of
life
while
those
who
showed
any
tendency
to
insanity
or
exhibited
any
congenital
deformity
would
also
be
rejected
by
the
younger
women
because
it
would
be
considered
an
offence
against
society
to
be
the
means
of
perpetuating
any
such
diseases
or
imperfections
we
must
also
take
account
of
a
special
factor
hitherto
almost
unnoticed
which
would
tend
to
intensify
the
selection
thus
exercised
it
is
a
fact
well
known
to
statisticians
that
although
females
are
in
excess
in
almost
all
civilised
populations
yet
this
is
not
due
to
a
law
of
nature
for
with
us
and
i
believe
in
all
parts
of
the
continent
more
males
than
females
are
born
to
an
amount
of
about
to
per
cent
but
between
the
ages
of
five
and
there
were
in
deaths
of
males
from
accident
or
violence
and
only
of
females
showing
an
excess
of
male
deaths
of
in
one
year
and
for
many
years
the
numbers
of
this
class
of
deaths
have
not
varied
much
the
excess
of
preventable
deaths
of
males
at
those
ages
being
very
nearly
annually
this
excess
is
no
doubt
due
to
boys
and
young
men
being
more
exposed
both
in
play
and
work
to
various
kinds
of
accidents
than
are
women
and
this
brings
about
the
constant
excess
of
females
in
what
may
be
termed
normal
civilised
populations
in
it
was
about
a
million
while
fifty
years
earlier
when
the
population
was
about
half
it
was
only
or
considerably
less
than
half
the
present
proportion
this
is
what
we
should
expect
from
the
constant
increase
of
accidents
and
of
emigration
the
effects
of
both
of
which
fall
most
upon
males
it
appears
therefore
that
the
larger
number
of
women
in
our
population
is
not
a
natural
phenomenon
but
is
almost
wholly
the
result
of
our
own
social
environment
when
the
lives
of
our
citizens
are
accounted
of
equal
value
to
the
community
irrespective
of
class
or
of
wealth
a
much
smaller
number
will
be
allowed
to
suffer
from
such
preventable
causes
while
as
our
colonies
fill
up
with
a
normal
population
and
the
enormous
areas
of
uncultivated
or
land
at
home
are
thrown
open
to
our
own
people
on
the
most
favourable
terms
the
great
tide
of
emigration
will
be
diminished
and
will
then
cease
to
affect
the
proportion
of
the
sexes
the
result
of
these
various
causes
now
all
tending
to
increase
the
numbers
of
the
female
population
will
in
a
rational
and
just
system
of
society
of
which
we
may
hope
soon
to
see
the
commencement
act
in
a
contrary
direction
and
will
in
a
few
generations
bring
the
sexes
first
to
an
equality
and
later
on
to
a
majority
of
males
there
are
some
no
doubt
who
will
object
that
even
when
women
have
a
free
choice
owing
to
improved
economic
conditions
they
will
not
choose
wisely
so
as
to
advance
the
race
but
no
one
has
the
right
to
make
such
a
statement
without
adducing
very
strong
evidence
in
support
of
it
we
have
for
generations
degraded
women
in
every
possible
way
but
we
now
know
that
such
degradation
is
not
hereditary
and
therefore
not
permanent

declared
that
whereas
men
loved
justice
wisdom
and
power
for
their
own
sakes
women
loved
them
as
seen
in
the
characters
of
men
it
is
generally
admitted
that
there
is
truth
in
this
observation
but
there
is
surely
still
more
truth
in
the
converse
that
they
do
not
admire
those
men
who
are
palpably
unjust
stupid
or
weak
and
still
less
those
who
are
distorted
diseased
or
grossly
vicious
though
under
present
conditions
they
are
often
driven
to
marry
them
it
may
be
taken
as
certain
therefore
that
when
women
are
economically
and
socially
free
to
choose
numbers
of
the
worst
men
among
all
classes
who
now
readily
obtain
wives
be
almost
universally
now
this
mode
of
improvement
by
elimination
of
the
less
desirable
has
many
advantages
over
that
of
securing
early
marriages
of
the
more
admired
for
what
we
most
require
is
to
improve
the
of
our
population
by
rejecting
its
lower
types
rather
than
by
raising
the
advanced
types
a
little
higher
great
and
good
men
are
always
produced
in
sufficient
numbers
and
have
always
been
so
produced
in
every
phase
of
civilisation
we
do
not
need
more
of
these
so
much
as
we
want
a
diminution
of
the
weaker
and
less
advanced
types
this
process
has
been
the
method
of
by
which
the
whole
of
the
glorious
vegetable
and
animal
kingdoms
have
been
developed
and
advanced
the
survival
of
the
fittest
is
really
the
extinction
of
the
unfit
and
it
is
the
one
brilliant
ray
of
hope
for
humanity
that
just
as
we
advance
in
the
reform
of
our
present
cruel
and
disastrous
social
system
we
shall
set
free
a
power
of
selection
in
marriage
that
will
steadily
and
certainly
improve
the
character
as
well
as
the
strength
and
the
beauty
of
our
race
reform
and
one
of
the
most
general
and
apparently
the
strongest
of
the
objections
to
any
thorough
schemes
of
social
reform
and
especially
to
those
that
will
abolish
want
and
the
constant
dread
of
starvation
is
that
in
any
society
in
which
this
is
done
early
marriages
will
be
much
more
numerous
there
will
be
no
prudential
checks
to
large
families
and
in
a
few
generations
as
malthus
argued
populations
will
increase
beyond
the
means
of
subsistence
then
will
commence
a
continual
decrease
of
culminating
in
universal
poverty
worse
than
any
that
now
exists
because
it
will
be
universal
the
following
quotation
from
an
eminent
american
writer
shows
that
this
fear
has
really
been
felt
if
it
be
true
that
reason
must
direct
the
course
of
human
evolution
and
if
it
be
also
true
that
selection
of
the
fittest
is
the
only
method
available
for
that
purpose
then
if
we
are
to
have
any
at
all
the
dreadful
law
of
of
the
weak
and
must
with
spartan
firmness
be
carried
out
voluntarily
and
deliberately
against
such
a
course
all
that
is
best
in
us
revolts
a
a
professor
joseph
le
conte
in
vol
a
more
recent
writer
flinders
petrie
the
egyptian
explorer
has
put
forward
similar
views
in
a
tentative
manner
but
clearly
showing
what
he
thinks
our
present
state
of
society
requires
of
the
compensation
to
workmen
for
accident
he
says
the
immediate
effect
upon
character
is
to
save
the
careless
thoughtless
and
incompetent
from
the
results
of
their
faults
this
at
once
reduces
largely
the
weeding
and
educational
effects
of
the
bad
qualities
and
of
pensions
his
concluding
remark
is
nature
knows
of
no
right
to
maintenance
but
only
the
necessity
of
getting
rid
of
these
who
need
it
by
mending
or
ending
them
again
as
to
the
huge
waste
of
infant
life
now
going
on
which
he
admits
is
preventable
and
might
be
saved
he
remarks
we
must
agree
that
it
would
be
of
the
lower
or
lowest
type
of
careless
thriftless
dirty
and
incapable
families
that
the
increase
would
be
obtained
is
it
worth
while
to
dilute
our
increase
of
population
by
per
cent
more
of
the
more
inferior
kind
and
he
concludes
thus
this
movement
is
doing
away
with
one
of
the
few
remains
of
natural
weeding
out
of
the
unfit
that
our
civilisation
has
left
us
and
it
will
certainly
cause
more
misery
than
happiness
in
the
course
of
a
century

in

by
flinders
petrie
the
whole
book
is
full
of
such
statements
as
the
above
for
which
neither
facts
nor
arguments
are
given
it
is
assumed
throughout
that
the
failures
in
our
modern
society
are
so
through
their
own
are
wastrels
deserve
neither
pity
nor

in
rescuing
these
wastrel
children
from
the
gutter
and
the
workhouse
treating
them
well
and
kindly
training
them
in
work
and
sending
many
thousands
to
canada
a
record
of
their
subsequent
life
was
kept
and
it
was
found
that
very
few
failed
to
do
well
while
a
very
large
majority
became
valuable
citizens
in
their
new
home
on
the
whole
they
were
in
no
way
inferior
to
the
average
of
emigrants
who
go
at
their
own
expense
and
who
are
admitted
to
be
among
the
best
of
our
workers
none
of
the
writers
of
the
class
here
quoted
seem
to
have
made
themselves
acquainted
with
the
researches
of
herbert
spencer
sir
galton
and
others
as
to
the
natural
laws
which
determine
the
rate
of
increase
of
population
when
those
laws
are
allowed
to
operate
freely
under
rational
and
moral
social
conditions
a
short
statement
of
these
laws
will
therefore
be
given
in
a
remarkable
essay
first
published
in
spencer
with
his
usual
philosophical
insight
examined
the
facts
of
reproduction
and
population
throughout
the
whole
of
the
animal
kingdom
and
showed
that
the
duration
of
the
individual
life
and
the
increase
of
the
race
varied
inversely
those
groups
which
have
the
simplest
organisation
and
the
shortest
lives
producing
the
greatest
number
of
offspring
in
other
terms
individuation
and
reproduction
are
antagonistic
but
individuation
depends
almost
entirely
on
the
development
and
specialisation
of
the
nervous
system
through
which
alone
all
advance
in
instinct
emotion
and
intellect
is
rendered
possible
the
actual
rate
of
increase
in
man
has
been
determined
by
the
necessities
of
the
savage
state
in
which
as
in
most
species
of
mammals
it
is
usually
what
is
just
required
to
maintain
a
limited
average
population
but
with
a
true
advance
in
civilisation
the
average
duration
of
life
increases
and
the
possible
increase
of
population
under
favourable
conditions
becomes
very
great
because
fertility
is
greater
than
is
needed
under
the
new
conditions
at
present
however
no
general
advance
in
intellectuality
has
taken
place
but
that
the
facts
do
accord
with
the
theory
is
indicated
by
the
common
observation
that
highly
intellectual
parents
do
not
have
large
families
while
the
most
rapid
increase
occurs
in
those
classes
which
are
engaged
in
healthy
manual
labour
but
a
law
founded
on
such
a
broad
physiological
basis
of
observation
is
sure
to
continue
in
action
and
we
may
therefore
feel
certain
that
as
the
intellectual
level
of
the
whole
race
is
raised
by
general
culture
and
physical
health
the
law
of
diminishing
fertility
will
act
and
will
tend
in
the
remote
future
to
bring
about
an
exact
balance
between
the
rate
of
increase
and
that
of
mortality
a
more
immediate
and
effective
check
to
rapid
increase
of
population
will
however
be
brought
about
by
the
social
reforms
already
suggested
when
poverty
is
abolished
and
neither
economic
nor
social
advantages
will
be
gained
by
early
marriage
there
can
be
no
doubt
it
will
be
generally
deferred
to
a
later
age
still
more
effective
will
be
the
extension
of
the
period
of
education
or
training
for
the
whole
population
for
several
years
longer
than
at
present
together
with
the
growth
of
public
opinion
against
all
marriages
between
persons
who
have
not
yet
begun
the
serious
work
of
life
it
would
also
be
an
essential
part
of
education
to
inculcate
the
delay
of
marriage
till
every
opportunity
has
been
afforded
both
of
the
parties
concerned
of
becoming
thoroughly
acquainted
with
each
other
before
undertaking
so
serious
a
responsibility
as
marriage
usually
involves
the
effect
of
even
a
few
years
delay
of
marriage
on
population
is
very
considerable
sir
galton
has
shown
from
the
best
statistics
available
that
if
we
compare
women
married
at
twenty
with
those
at
the
comparative
fertility
is
as
to
but
this
does
not
represent
the
whole
effect
on
increase
of
population
when
marriage
is
delayed
the
time
between
successive
generations
is
correspondingly
increased
and
yet
another
effect
in
the
same
direction
is
produced
by
the
fact
that
the
greater
the
average
age
of
marriage
the
fewer
generations
are
alive
at
the
same
time
and
it
is
the
combined
effect
of
these
three
factors
that
determines
the
actual
increase
of
the
population
due
to
this
cause
sir
galton
gives
a
remarkable
table
showing
this
combined
result
of
these
causes
he
finds
that
if
one
hundred
mothers
and
their
daughters
in
each
successive
generation
marry
at
twenty
there
will
be
an
increase
of
such
mothers
in
each
successive
generation
of
if
however
they
marry
at
each
successive
generation
of
mothers
diminishes
in
the
proportion
of
if
this
goes
on
for
years
the
hundred
mothers
who
marry
at
twenty
have
increased
to
and
in
years
to
while
those
who
marry
at
will
have
decreased
to
and
respectively
it
is
therefore
shown
that
under
present
social
conditions
the
age
of
marriage
necessary
to
preserve
a
stationary
population
will
be
somewhere
between
twenty
and
the
above
figures
are
however
founded
on
special
cases
and
the
actual
facts
are
so
complicated
by
the
number
of
childless
marriages
the
rate
of
infantile
mortality
and
other
causes
that
they
must
be
taken
only
as
establishing
a
of
rather
rapid
decrease
of
fertility
with
each
year
addition
to
the
average
age
of
marriage
of
the
mother
i
have
now
i
venture
to
hope
established
two
important
principles
in
relation
to
human
progress
in
the
first
place
i
have
shown
that
modern
ideas
as
to
the
necessity
of
dealing
with
some
of
our
glaring
social
evils
such
as
race
degeneration
and
the
various
forms
of
sexual
immorality
are
fundamentally
wrong
and
are
doomed
to
failure
so
long
as
their
fundamental
poverty
destitution
and
not
greatly
diminished
and
ultimately
abolished
i
have
proved
that
human
nature
is
in
itself
such
a
complete
failure
as
our
modern
eugenists
seem
to
suppose
but
that
it
is
influenced
by
fundamental
laws
which
under
reasonably
just
and
equal
will
automatically
abolish
all
these
evils
in
the
second
place
i
have
shown
that
the
dread
of
as
the
result
of
the
abolition
of
poverty
is
wholly
and
utterly
mere
bugbear
created
by
ignorance
of
natural
laws
and
of
presumption
in
thinking
that
we
can
cure
social
evils
while
leaving
the
causes
which
produce
them
unaltered
the
three
great
natural
laws
which
all
our
reformers
ignore
are
that
a
very
moderate
advance
in
the
average
age
of
would
certainly
result
from
a
truly
rational
system
of
education
combined
with
economic
diminishes
the
rate
of
increase
of
the
population
that
every
approach
to
educational
and
economic
equality
by
effecting
a
large
saving
of
the
lives
of
males
who
now
die
from
preventable
causes
combined
with
the
fact
that
male
births
those
of
females
would
so
diminish
the
number
of
the
latter
that
they
would
soon
become
less
instead
of
as
now
more
than
that
of
males
that
this
would
give
them
an
in
marriage
which
they
do
not
now
possess
together
with
the
power
of
delay
which
for
many
reasons
large
numbers
of
them
would
exercise
the
law
of
diminishing
fertility
with
increase
of
through
education
and
training
would
further
tend
to
the
diminution
of
fertility
these
three
natural
causes
all
in
one
equality
of
births
with
deaths
while
their
action
would
be
so
readily
modified
by
public
opinion
as
to
obviate
all
danger
of
either
increase
or
decrease
beyond
what
was
necessary
for
the
of
each
community
nation
or
race
future
status
of
the
foregoing
statement
of
the
effect
of
established
natural
laws
if
allowed
free
play
under
rational
conditions
of
civilisation
clearly
indicates
that
the
position
of
woman
in
the
not
distant
future
will
be
far
higher
and
more
important
than
any
which
has
been
claimed
for
or
by
her
in
the
past
while
she
will
be
conceded
full
political
and
social
rights
on
an
equality
with
man
she
will
be
placed
in
a
position
of
responsibility
and
power
which
will
render
her
his
superior
since
the
future
moral
progress
of
the
race
will
so
largely
depend
upon
her
free
choice
in
marriage
as
time
goes
on
and
she
acquires
more
and
more
economic
independence
alone
will
give
her
an
effective
choice
which
she
has
never
had
before
but
this
choice
will
be
further
strengthened
by
the
fact
that
with
approach
to
equality
of
opportunity
for
every
child
born
in
our
country
that
terrible
excess
of
male
deaths
in
boyhood
and
early
manhood
especially
due
to
various
preventable
causes
will
disappear
and
change
the
present
majority
of
women
to
a
majority
of
men
this
will
lead
to
a
greater
rivalry
for
wives
and
will
give
to
women
the
power
of
rejecting
all
the
lower
types
of
character
among
their
suitors
it
will
be
their
special
duty
so
to
mould
public
opinion
through
home
training
and
social
influence
as
to
render
the
women
of
the
future
the
regenerators
of
the
entire
human
race
we
hope
and
believe
that
they
will
be
fully
equal
to
the
high
and
responsible
position
which
in
accordance
with
natural
laws
they
will
be
called
upon
to
fulfil
the
certainty
that
this
powerful
selective
agency
will
come
into
existence
just
in
proportion
as
we
reform
our
existing
social
system
by
the
abolition
of
poverty
and
the
establishment
of
full
equality
of
opportunity
in
education
and
economic
position
demonstrates
that
the
universal
not
failed
or
bungled
our
world
so
completely
as
to
require
the
weak
and
ignorant
efforts
of
the
eugenists
to
set
it
right
while
leaving
the
great
fundamental
causes
of
all
existing
social
evils
absolutely
untouched
let
them
devote
all
their
energies
to
purifying
this
whitened
sepulchre
of
destitution
and
ignorance
and
the
beneficent
laws
of
human
nature
will
themselves
bring
about
the
physical
intellectual
and
moral
advancement
of
our
race

of
moral
progress
in
chapters
viii
to

of
this
volume
i
have
given
in
briefest
outline
a
summary
of
the
growth
during
the
nineteenth
century
of
the
actual
social
environment
in
the
midst
of
which
we
live
we
see
a
continuous
advance
of
man
power
to
utilise
the
forces
of
nature
to
an
extent
which
surpasses
everything
he
had
been
able
to
do
during
all
the
preceding
centuries
of
his
recorded
history
we
also
see
that
the
result
of
this
vast
economic
revolution
has
been
almost
wholly
evil
we
see
that
this
hundredfold
increase
of
wealth
amply
sufficient
to
provide
necessaries
comforts
and
all
beneficial
refinements
and
luxuries
for
our
whole
population
has
been
distributed
with
such
gross
injustice
that
the
actual
condition
of
those
who
produce
all
this
wealth
has
become
worse
and
worse
no
efficient
arrangements
having
been
made
that
from
the
overflowing
abundance
produced
should
receive
the
mere
essentials
of
a
healthy
and
happy
existence
we
have
seen
huge
cities
grow
up
every
one
of
them
with
their
overcrowded
insanitary
slums
where
men
women
and
children
die
prematurely
as
surely
as
though
a
body
of
secret
poisoners
were
constantly
at
work
to
destroy
them
we
see
thousands
of
girls
compelled
by
starvation
to
work
in
such
an
empoisoned
environment
as
to
produce
horribly
painful
and
disfiguring
disease
which
is
often
fatal
in
early
youth
or
in
what
ought
to
have
been
and
what
might
have
been
the
period
of
maximum
enjoyment
of
their
womanhood
and
to
this
very
day
no
efficient
steps
have
been
taken
to
abolish
these
conditions
we
see
millions
still
struggling
in
vain
for
a
sufficiency
of
the
bare
necessaries
of
life
which
in
their
misery
is
all
they
ask
often
culminating
in
actual
starvation
or
in
suicide
to
which
they
are
driven
by
the
dread
of
starvation
yet
our
governments
selected
from
among
the
most
educated
the
most
talented
the
wealthiest
of
the
country
with
absolute
power
to
make
what
laws
and
regulations
they
please
and
an
overflowing
fund
of
accumulated
wealth
to
draw
upon
do
nothing
although
more
people
die
annually
of
want
than
are
killed
in
a
great
war
and
more
children
than
could
be
slaughtered
by
many
herods
and
while
all
this
goes
on
in
the
depths
pale
anguish
keeps
the
heavy
gate
and
the
warder
is
despair
a
little
higher
up
among
the
distributors
of
the
necessaries
and
luxuries
of
life
bribery
adulteration
and
various
forms
of
petty
dishonesty
are
rampant
and
higher
yet
among
the
great
capitalists
the
merchant
princes
the
captains
of
industry
we
find
hard
taskmasters
who
drive
down
wages
below
the
level
of
bare
subsistence
and
who
support
a
more
gigantic
and
widespread
system
of
gambling
than
the
world
has
ever
seen
and
finally
our
administration
of
what
we
call
justice
and
of
which
we
are
so
proud
because
our
judges
can
not
be
bribed
is
utterly
because
it
is
based
on
a
system
of
money
fees
at
every
step
because
it
is
so
cumbrous
and
full
of
technicalities
as
to
need
the
employment
of
attorneys
and
counsel
at
great
cost
and
because
all
petty
offences
are
punishable
by
fine
imprisonment
which
makes
poverty
itself
a
crime
while
it
allows
those
with
money
to
go
practically
free
account
of
these
various
groups
of
undoubted
facts
many
of
which
are
so
gross
so
terrible
that
they
can
not
be
overstated
it
is
not
too
much
to
say
that
our
whole
system
of
society
is
rotten
from
top
to
bottom
and
the
social
environment
as
a
whole
in
relation
to
our
possibilities
and
our
claims
is
the
worst
that
the
world
has
ever
such
are
the
evil
products
of
the
social
environment
we
have
ourselves
created
in
the
course
of
a
single
century
we
have
seen
it
going
from
bad
to
worse
and
have
applied
petty
remedies
here
and
there
during
the
whole
period
but
the
evils
have
continued
to
increase
it
has
now
become
clear
to
the
more
intelligent
of
the
workers
that
if
we
wish
to
improve
we
wish
to
prevent
it
from
getting
even
worse
than
it
must
deal
with
the
of
the
evil
and
so
far
as
possible
the
conditions
which
are
so
demonstrably
bad
such
hideous
and
fortunately
this
is
by
no
means
so
difficult
as
it
may
seem
to
be
because
a
large
body
of
our
thinkers
and
a
considerable
number
of
our
workers
see
clearly
what
these
are
and
less
clearly
how
to
remedy
them
they
will
however
give
their
energetic
support
to
any
government
that
devotes
itself
to
the
task
of
remedying
them
the
following
are
my
own
views
as
to
how
the
problem
must
be
attacked
in
order
to
solve
it
thoroughly
and
permanently
and
the
if
we
review
with
care
the
long
train
of
social
evils
which
have
grown
up
during
the
nineteenth
century
we
shall
find
that
every
one
of
them
however
diverse
in
their
nature
and
results
is
due
to
the
same
general
cause
which
may
be
defined
or
stated
in
a
variety
of
different
ways
they
are
due
broadly
and
generally
to
our
living
under
a
system
of
universal
for
the
means
of
existence
the
remedy
for
which
is
equally
universal
it
may
be
also
defined
as
a
system
of
as
of
enemies
the
remedy
being
a
system
of
as
of
a
great
family
or
of
friends
our
system
is
also
one
of
by
a
few
of
all
the
means
of
existence
the
land
without
access
to
which
no
life
is
possible
and
capital
or
the
results
of
labour
which
is
now
in
the
possession
of
a
limited
number
of
capitalists
and
therefore
is
also
a
monopoly
the
remedy
is
freedom
of
access
to
land
and
capital
for
all
also
it
may
be
defined
as
inasmuch
as
the
in
each
generation
are
allowed
to
inherit
the
wealth
of
all
preceding
generations
while
the
inherit
nothing
the
remedy
is
to
adopt
the
principle
of
equality
of
opportunity
for
all
or
of
universal
by
the
state
in
trust
for
the
whole
these
four
statements
of
the
existing
of
all
our
social
evils
can
not
i
believe
be
controverted
and
the
for
them
may
be
condensed
into
one
general
proposition
that
it
is
the
first
duty
in
importance
of
a
civilised
government
to
organise
the
labour
of
the
whole
community
for
the
equal
good
of
all
but
it
is
also
their
first
duty
in
time
to
take
immediate
steps
to
abolish
by
starvation
and
by
preventable
due
to
insanitary
dwellings
and
dangerous
employments
while
carefully
elaborating
the
remedy
for
want
in
the
midst
of
wealth
i
myself
have
pointed
out
how
these
two
ends
may
be
best
achieved
and
hope
to
elaborate
them
in
the
meantime
i
call
attention
to
standish
letter
to
the
leaders
of
labour
in
new
of
november
in
which
after
referring
to
the
very
natural
dread
by
the
rich
of
any
such
radical
reorganisation
of
society
as
leading
to
their
own
financial
ruin
which
it
certainly
need
not
do
he
makes
the
following
suggestive
statement
with
which
i
hope
all
my
readers
will
agree
but
what
they
fail
to
perceive
is
that
in
a
world
like
this
made
by
infinite
goodness
and
wisdom
right
is
always
the
great
for
men
and
for
nations
and
for
the
rich
as
well
as
for
the
poor
and
that
wrong
sooner
or
later
ends
in
misery
and
destruction
that
is
sound
moral
teaching
we
have
been
doing
the
wrong
for
the
past
century
and
we
have
reaped
and
are
reaping
misery
and
destruction
it
is
time
that
we
changed
our
methods
which
are
all
as
i
think
i
have
sufficiently
pointed
out
fundamentally
wrong
radically
unjust
wholly
immoral
we
have
ourselves
created
an
immoral
or
unmoral
social
environment
to
undo
its
inevitable
results
we
must
reverse
our
course
we
must
see
that
our
economic
legislation
our
social
reforms
are
in
the
very
opposite
direction
to
those
hitherto
adopted
and
that
they
tend
in
the
direction
of
one
or
other
of
the
four
fundamental
remedies
i
have
suggested
in
this
way
only
can
we
hope
to
change
our
existing
immoral
environment
into
a
moral
one
and
initiate
a
new
era
of
moral
progress
in
chapters
xiii
to
xvi
i
have
shown
that
the
laws
of
evolution
as
they
really
apply
to
mankind
are
all
favourable
to
the
advance
of
true
civilisation
and
of
morality
our
existing
competitive
and
antagonistic
social
system
alone
neutralises
their
beneficent
operation
that
system
must
therefore
be
radically
changed
into
one
of
brotherly
and
for
the
equal
good
of
all
to
succeed
we
must
make
this
principle

guide
