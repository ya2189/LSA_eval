in

among
the
most
striking
and
commonly
observed
manifestations
of
insanity
are
certain
disorders
of
the
flow
of
utterance
which
appear
to
be
dependent
upon
a
derangement
of
the
psychical
processes
commonly
termed
association
of
ideas
these
disorders
have
to
some
extent
been
made
the
subject
of
psychological
experimentation
and
the
object
of
this
investigation
is
to
continue
and
extend
the
study
of
these
phenomena
by
an
application
of
the
experimental
method
known
as
the
association
test
method
of
investigation
in
this
investigation
we
have
followed
a
modified
form
of
the
method
developed
by
sommer
the
essential
feature
of
which
is
the
statistical
treatment
of
results
obtained
by
uniform
technique
from
a
large
number
of
cases

the
stimulus
consists
of
a
series
of
one
hundred
spoken
words
to
each
of
which
the
subject
is
directed
to
react
by
the
first
word
which
it
makes
him
think
of
in
the
selection
of
the
stimulus
words
of
which
were
taken
from
the
list
suggested
by
sommer
we
have
taken
care
to
avoid
such
words
as
are
especially
liable
to
call
up
personal
experiences
and
have
so
arranged
the
words
as
to
separate
any
two
which
bear
an
obviously
close
relation
to
one
another
after
much
preliminary
experimentation
we
adopted
the

no
attempt
is
made
to
secure
uniformity
of
external
conditions
for
the
test
the
aim
has
been
rather
to
make
it
so
simple
as
to
render
strictly
experimental
conditions
unnecessary
the
test
may
be
made
in
any
room
that
is
reasonably
free
from
distracting
influences
the
subject
is
seated
with
his
back
toward
the
experimenter
so
that
he
can
not
see
the
record
he
is
requested
to
respond
to
each
stimulus
word
by
one
word
the
first
word
that
occurs
to
him
other
than
the
stimulus
word
itself
and
on
no
account
more
than
one
word
if
an
untrained
subject
reacts
by
a
sentence
or
phrase
a
compound
word
or
a
different
grammatical
form
of
the
stimulus
word
the
reaction
is
left
unrecorded
and
the
stimulus
word
is
repeated
at
the
close
of
the
test
in
this
investigation
no
account
is
taken
of
the
reaction
time
the
reasons
for
this
will
be
explained
later
the
general
plan
has
been
first
to
apply
the
test
to
normal
persons
so
as
to
derive
empirically
a
normal
standard
and
to
determine
if
possible
the
nature
and
limits
of
normal
variation
and
then
to
apply
it
to
cases
of
various
forms
of
insanity
and
to
compare
the
results
with
the
normal
standard
with
a
view
to
determining
the
nature
of
pathological
variation
the
normal
standard
in
order
to
establish
a
standard
which
should
fairly
represent
at
least
all
the
common
types
of
association
and
which
should
show
the
extent
of
such
variation
as
might
be
due
to
differences
in
sex
temperament
education
and
environment
we
have
applied
the
test
to
over
one
thousand
normal
subjects
among
these
subjects
were
persons
of
both
sexes
and
of
ages
ranging
from
eight
years
to
over
eighty
years
persons
following
different
occupations
possessing
various
degrees
of
mental
capacity
and
education
and
living
in
widely
separated
localities
many
were
from
ireland
and
some
of
these
had
but
recently
arrived
in
this
country
others
were
from
different
parts
of
europe
but
all
were
able
to
speak
english
with
at
least
fair
fluency
over
two
hundred
of
the
subjects
including
a
few
university
professors
and
other
highly
practiced
observers
were
professional
men
and
women
or
college
students
about
five
hundred
were
employed
in
one
or
another
of
the
new
york
state
hospitals
for
the
insane
either
as
nurses
and
attendants
or
as
workers
at
various
trades
the
majority
of
these
were
persons
of
common
school
education
but
the
group
includes
also
on
the
one
hand
a
considerable
number
of
high
school
graduates
and
on
the
other
hand
a
few
laborers
who
were
almost
or
wholly
illiterate
nearly
one
hundred
and
fifty
of
the
subjects
were
boys
and
girls
of
high
school
age
pupils
of
the
ethical
culture
school
new

the
remaining
subjects
form
a
miscellaneous
group
consisting
largely
of
clerks
and
farmers
the
frequency
tables
from
the
records
obtained
from
these
normal
subjects
including
in
all
reactions
we
have
compiled
a
series
of
tables
one
for
each
stimulus
word
showing
all
the
different
reactions
given
by
one
thousand
subjects
in
response
to
that
stimulus
word
and
the
frequency
with
which
each
reaction
has
occurred
these
tables
will
be
found
at
the
end
of
this

but
for
other
purposes
with
the
exception
of
a
few
distinctive
proper
names
which
are
indicated
by

we
have
followed
the
plan
of
introducing
each
word
into
the
table
exactly
as
it
was
found
in
the
record
in
the
arrangement
of
the
words

have
placed
together

the
derivatives
of
a

root
regardless
of
the
strict

order
footnote
it
should
be
mentioned
that
we
have
discovered
a
few
errors
in
these
tables
some
of
these
were
made
in
compiling
them
from
the
records
and
were
evidently
due
to
the
assistant
difficulty
of
reading
a
strange
handwriting
other
errors
have
been
found
in
the
records
themselves
each
of
the
stimulus
words
and
appears
from
the
tables
to
have
been
repeated
by
a
subject
as
a
reaction
such
a
reaction
had
it
occurred
would
not
have
been
accepted
and
it
is
plain
that
the
experimenter
wrote
the
stimulus
word
in
the
space
where
the
reaction
word
should
have
been
written
still
other
errors
were
due
to
the
experimenter
failure
to
speak
with
sufficient
distinctness
when
reading
off
the
stimulus
words
thus
the
reaction
in
response
to

that
the
stimulus

was
probably
understood
as

the

was
understood
as
the
total
number
of

from

and
only

out
of

of
one
thousand
gave
reactions
which
were

by
any

obtained

this
method

examined
by
referring
to

the

in

will
fall
into
two
classes
the

those
which
are
to
be
found
in

and
the

which
are
not

the
sake

which
is
a

classed
as

of
any

may
be
expressed
by
the
figure

thus
the
reaction

was
given
by

in
the
study
of
the
reactions
furnished
by

normal

it
was
possible
to
analyze
the
record
of
any
subject
only
by
removing
it
from
the
mass
of
material
which
forms
our
tables
and
using
as
the
standard
of
comparison
the
reactions
of
the
remaining
subjects
in
order
to
determine
the
influence
of
age
sex
and
education
upon
the
tendency
to
give
reactions
of
various
values
we
have
selected
three
groups
of
subjects
for
special
study
one
hundred
persons
of
collegiate
or
professional
education
one
hundred
persons
of
common
school
education
employed
in
one
of
the
state
hospitals
as
attendants
but
not
as
trained
nurses
and
children
under
sixteen
years
of
age
the
reactions
given
by
these
subjects
have
been
classified
according
to

into

that
the

the
general

is
below
the

in

however
of
the
wide
limits
of
variation
among
the

subjects
these
deviations
from
the
general

are
no
larger
than
might
quite
possibly
occur
by
chance
and
the
number
of
cases
in
each
group
is
so
small
that
the
conclusion
that
education
tends
to
increase
the
number
of
individual
reactions
would
hardly
be
justified
it
will
be
observed
also
that
this
comparative
study
does
not
show
any
considerable
differences
corresponding
to
age
or
sex
with
regard
to
the
type
of
reaction
it
is

to
select
groups
of
records
which
present
more
or
less
consistently
one
of
the
following
special
tendencies
the
tendency
to
react
by
contrasts
the
tendency
to
react
by
synonyms
or
other
defining
terms
and
the
tendency
to
react
by
qualifying
or
specifying
terms
how
clearly
the
selected
groups
show
these
tendencies
is
indicated
by

ii
the
majority
of
records
however
present
no
such
tendency
in
a
consistent
way
nor
is
there
any
evidence
to
show
that
these
tendencies
when
they
occur
are
to
be
regarded
as
manifestations
of
permanent
mental
characteristics
since
they
might
quite
possibly
be
due
to
a
more
or
less
accidental
and
transient
associational
direction
no
further
study
has
as
yet
been
made
of
these
tendencies
for
the
reason
that
they
do
not
appear
to
possess
any

on

obtained
by

immediate
association
to

but
we
have
found
it

that

the

this

to
establish
as

as
possible
strictly
objective
criteria
for
distinguishing

for
this
reason
we
have
made
no
attempt

determine
by

introspection
the
causes
of
variations
of
reaction
time
it
would
seem
that
the
importance
and
magnitude
of
the
problem
of
association
time
are
such
as
to
demand
not
merely
a
crude
measurement
of
the
gross
reaction
time
in
a
large
number
of
cases
but
rather
a
special
investigation
by
such
exact
methods
as
have
been
used
by
cattell
and
others
in
the
analysis
of
the
complex
reaction
it
would
be
impracticable
for
us
to
employ

methods
in

so
extensive
as
this
footnote
mind
vol
xi
in
view
of
these
considerations
we
discontinued
the
recording
of
the
reaction
time
if
the
association
test
is
to
be
useful
in
the
study
of
pathological
conditions
it
is
of
great
importance
to
have
a
reliable
measure
of
the
associational
value
of
a
pair
of
ideas
many
attempts
have
been
made
to
modify
and
amplify
the
classical
grouping
of
associations
according
to
similarity
contrast
contiguity
and
sequence
so
as
to
make
it
serviceable
in
differentiating
between
normal
and
abnormal
associations
in
this
study
we
attempted
to
apply
aschaffenburg
classification
of
reactions
but
without
success
our
failure
to
utilize
this
system
of
classification
is
assigned
to
the
following
considerations
distinctions
between
associations
according
to
logical
relations
are
extremely
difficult
to
define
in
many
cases
there
is
room
for
difference
of
opinion
as
to
the
proper
place
for
an
association
and
thus
the
application
of
a
logical
scheme
depends
largely
upon
the
personal
equation
of
the
observer
that
even
experienced
observers
can
not
in
all
cases
agree
in
placing
an
association
is
shown
by
aschaffenburg
criticisms
of
the
opinions
of
other
observers
on
this
point
logical
distinctions
do
not
bring
out
clearly
the
differences
between
the
reactions
of
normal
subjects
and
those
of
insane
subjects
logically
the
reaction
which
was
given
by
a
patient
might
be
placed
in
the
class
with
the
reaction
although
there
is
an
obvious
difference
between
the
two
reactions
many
of
the
reactions
given
by
insane
subjects
possess
no
obvious
logical
value
whatever
but
since
any
combination
of
ideas
may
represent
a
relationship
either
real
or
imagined
it
would
be
arbitrary
to
characterize
such
a
reaction
as
incoherent

the
criterion
of
values
which
is
used
in
this
study
is
an
empirical
one
as
has
already
been
explained
every
word
contained
in
the
frequency
tables
possesses
a
value
of
at
least
per
cent
and
other
words
have
a
zero
value
with
the
aid
of
our
method
the
difficulty
of
classifying
the
reactions
quoted
above
is
obviated
as
it
is
necessary
only
to
refer
to
the
table
to
find
their
proper
values
the
value
of
the
reaction
is
per
cent
while
that
of
the
reaction
is
logically
the
combination
may
be
placed
in
any
one
of
four
classes
as
follows
intrinsic
causal
dependence
health
wealth
coordination
extrinsic
speech
reminiscence
sound
similarity
but
since
our
table
shows
this
association
to
have
an
empirical
value
of
per
cent
it
becomes
immaterial
which
of
its
logical
relations
is
to
be
considered
the
strongest
it
is
mainly
important
from
our
point
of
view
to
separate
reactions
possessing
an
empirical
value
from
those
whose
value
is
zero
an
empirical
principle
of
normal
association
on
a
general
survey
of
the
whole
mass
of
material
which
forms
the
basis
of
the
first
part
of
this
study
we
are
led
to
observe
that
one
tendency
which
appears
to
be
almost
universal
among
normal
persons
is
the
tendency
to
give
in
response
to
any
stimulus
word
one
or
another
of
a
small
group
of
common
it
appears
from
the
pathological
material
now
on
hand
that
this
tendency
is
greatly
weakened
in
some
cases
of
mental
disease
many
patients
have
given
more
than
per
cent
of
individual
reactions
it
should
be
mentioned
that
occasionally
a
presumably
normal
subject
has
given
a
record
very
similar
to
those
obtained
from
patients
in
respect
to
both
the
number
and
the
nature
of
the
individual
reactions
a
few
subjects
who
gave
peculiar
reactions
were
known
to
possess
significant
eccentricities
and
for
this
reason
we
excluded
their
records
from
the
thousand
records
which
furnished
the
basis
for
the
frequency
tables
we
excluded
also
a
few
peculiar
records
obtained
from
subjects
of
whom
nothing
was
known
on
the
ground
that
such
records
would
serve
only
to
make
the
tables
more
cumbersome
without
adding
anything
to
their
practical
value
the
total
number
of
records
thus
excluded
was
seventeen
it
will
be
apparent
to
anyone
who
examines
the
frequency
tables
that
the
reactions
obtained
from
one
thousand
persons
fall
short
of
exhausting
the
normal
associational
possibilities
of
these
stimulus
words
the
tables
however
have
been
found
to
be
sufficiently
inclusive
for
the
practical
purpose
which
they
were
intended
to
serve
common
reactions
whether
given
by
a
sane
or
an
insane
subject
may
in
the
vast
majority
of
instances
safely
be
regarded
as
normal
as
to
individual
reactions
they
can
not
all
be
regarded
as
abnormal
but
they
include
nearly
all
those
reactions
which
are
worthy
of
special
analysis
in
view
of
their
possible
pathological
significance
what
can
be
said
further
of
individual
reactions
whether
normal
or
abnormal
will
appear

the

forms
the

of
the
present

of

consists
mainly
of
two
hundred
and

obtained
for
the
most

from

at

a
comparison

reveals
in

of
a
weakening

it
seems
evident
from
this
that
pathological
significance
attaches
mainly
to
individual
reactions
so
that
our
study
resolves
itself
largely
into
an
analysis
and
classification
of
individual
reactions
and
an
attempt
to
determine
what
relationship
if
any
exists
between
the
different
types
of
reactions
and
the
different
clinical
forms
of
mental
disease
classification
of
reactions
those
who
have
attempted
to
use
the
association
test
in
the
study
of
insanity
have
felt
the
need
of
a
practical
classification
of
reactions
and
have
at
the
same
time
encountered
the
difficulty
of
establishing
definite
criteria
for
distinguishing
the
different
groups
from
one
another
it
is
a
comparatively
simple
matter
to
make
these
distinctions
in
a
general
way
and
even
to
formulate
a
more
or
less
comprehensive
theoretical
classification
but
there
still
remains
much
difficulty
in
practice
we
have
made
repeated
attempts
to
utilize
various
systems
of
classification
which
involve
free
play
of
personal
equation
in
their
application
although
for
us
the
matter
is
greatly
simplified
by
the
elimination
of
all
the
common
reactions
with
the
aid
of
the
frequency
tables
we
have
nevertheless
met
with
no
success
the
distinctions
made
by
either
of
us
have
on
no
occasion
fully
satisfied
at
the
second
reading
either
the
one
who
made
them
or
the
other
while
a
comparison
of
the
distinctions
made
by
each
of
us
independently
has
shown
a
disagreement
to
the
extent
of
per
cent
we
sought
therefore
to
formulate
a
classification
in
which
the
various
groups
should
be
so
defined
as
to
obviate
the
interference
of
personal
equation
in
the
work
of
applying
it
hoping
thus
to
achieve
greater
accuracy
in
this
we
can
lay
claim
to
only
partial
success
for
in
the
first
place
having
satisfactorily
defined
a
number
of
groups
we
found
it
necessary
in
the
end
to
provide
a
special
group
for
unclassified
reactions
into
which
falls
more
than
of
the
total
number
of
individual
reactions
and
in
the
second
place
in
at
least
two
of
our
groups
the
play
of
personal
equation
has
not
been
entirely
eliminated
so
that
there
is
still
a
possibility
of
error
to
the
extent
of
five
per
cent
of
individual
reactions
which
means
approximately
one
per
cent
of
the
total
number
of
reactions
we
have
found
however
that
in
spite
of
these
shortcomings
the
classification
here
proposed
is
more
serviceable
than
others
which
though
more
comprehensive
are
at
the
same
time
lacking
in
definiteness
our
classification
consists
of
the
following

it
has
already
been

that

are
in
the
vast
majority
of
instances
to
be
regarded
as
normal
from
amongst
them
however
a
fairly
definite
group
can
be
separated
out
which
seems
to
possess
some
pathological
significance
namely
the
group
which
we
have
termed
in
this
group
are
placed
words
which
are
so
widely
applicable
as
to
serve
as
more
or
less
appropriate
reactions
to
almost
any
of
our
stimulus
words
that
such
reactions
are
in
value
inferior
to
the
remaining
group
of
common
reactions
which
we
have
termed
in
contradistinction
is
perhaps
sufficiently
obvious
we
shall
speak
later
however
of
their
occurrence
in
both
normal
and
insane
cases
it
is
not
always
easy
to
judge
whether
or
not
a
given
reaction
should
be
classed
as
a
study
of
our
material
made
with
special
reference
to
this
type
of
reactions
has
enabled
us
to
select
the
following
list
of
words
any
of
which
occurring
in
response
to
any

word
is
classed
as
a

already
been
defined
any
reaction
word
which
is
not
found
in
the
table
in
its
identical
form
but
which
is
a

of
a
word
found
there
is
placed
in
this

explanation
of

and

reactions
inasmuch
as
the
frequency
tables
do
not
exhaust
all
normal
possibilities
of
reaction
a
certain
number
of
reactions
which
are
essentially
normal
are
to
be
found
among
the
individual
reactions
in
order
to
separate
these
from
the
pathological
reactions
we
have
compiled
an
appendix
to
the
frequency
tables
consisting
mainly
of
specific
definitions
of
groups
of
words
to
be
included
under
each
stimulus
word
in
our
list
this
appendix
will
be
found
at
the
end
of
this
paper
a
word
of
explanation
is
perhaps
due
as
to
the
manner
in
which
the
appendix
has
been
compiled
it
was
developed
in
a
purely
empirical
way
the
basis
being
such
individual
reactions
given
by
both
normal
and
insane
subjects
as
seemed
in
our
judgment
to
be
obviously
normal
it
must
be
acknowledged
that
the
appendix
falls
short
of
all
that
might
be
desired
in
the
first
place
its
use
involves
to
some
slight
extent
the
play
of
personal
equation
and
it
therefore
constitutes
a
source
of
error
in
the
second
place
it
is
in
some
respects
too
inclusive
while
in
other
respects
it
is
not
sufficiently
so
however
the
error
due
to
personal
equation
is
slight
the
inclusion
of
certain
or
even
frankly
pathological
reactions
may
be
discounted
by
bearing
in
mind
that
the
general
value
of
this
group
is
not
equal
to
that
of
the
group
of
common
reactions
and
the
number
of
strictly
normal
reactions
which
are
not
included
is
after
all
small
our
experience
has
shown
us
that
the
appendix
constitutes
an
important
aid
in
the
analysis
of
individual
reactions
reactions
derivatives
of
stimulus
words
we
place
here
any
reaction
which
is
a
grammatical
variant
or
derivative
of
a
stimulus
word
the
tendency
to
give
such
reactions
seems
to
be
dependent
upon
a
suspension
or
inhibition
of
the
normal
process
by
which
the
stimulus
word
excites
the
production
of
a
new
concept
for
we
have
here
not
a
production
of
a
new
concept
but
a
mere
change
in
the
form
of
the
stimulus
word
as
examples
of
such
reactions
may
be
mentioned
dissociation
we
have
employed
the
term
dissociation
to
indicate
a
rupture
of
that
bond
whatever
be
its
may
be
supposed
to
exist
normally
between
stimulus
and
reaction
and
which
causes
normal
persons
to
respond
in
the
majority
of
instances
by
common
reactions
and
we
speak
of
partial
dissociation
where
there
is
still
an
obvious
though
weak
and
superficial
connection
under
this
heading
we
can
differentiate
four
types
have
already
been
defined
we
distinguish
those
in
this
class
from
those
in
the
class
of
common
reactions
by
means
of
the
frequency
tables
reactions
this
type
requires
no
explanation
the
main
difficulty
is
to
decide
what
degree
of
sound
similarity
between
stimulus
and
reaction
should
be
deemed
sufficient
for
placing
a
reaction
under
this
heading
the
total
number
of
different
sounds
used
in
language
articulation
is
of
course
small
so
that
any
two
words
are
liable
to
present
considerable
chance
similarity
some
time
ago
we
estimated
the
average
degree
of
sound
similarity
between
stimulus
words
and
reaction
words
in
a
series
of
one
hundred
test
records
obtained
from
normal
persons
we
found
that
on
the
average
per
cent
of
the
sounds
of
the
stimulus
words
were
reproduced
in
the
same
order
in
the
reaction
word
our
experience
finally
led
us
to
adopt
the
following
general
rule
a
reaction
is
to
be
placed
under
this
heading
when
fifty
per
cent
of
the
sounds
of
the
shorter
word
of
the
pair
are
identical
with
sounds
of
the
longer
word
and
are
ranged
in
the
same
order
among
sound
reactions
we
occasionally
find
for
these
a
separate
heading
is
provided
possibly
their
occurrence
may
be
taken
as
an
indication
of
an
exaggerated
tendency
to
respond
by
sound
reactions
compliments
here
we
include
any
reaction
which
added
to
the
stimulus
word
forms
a
word
a
proper
name
or
a
compound
word
in
common
use
of
speech
under
this
heading
we
include
articles
numerals
pronouns
auxiliary
verbs
adverbs
of
time
place
and
degree
conjunctions
prepositions
and
interjections
dissociation
here
are
included
reactions
which
appear
to
be
entirely
unrelated
to
the
corresponding
stimulus
words
in
the
case
of
such
reactions
the
stimulus
words
seem
to
act
as
aschaffenburg
has
pointed
out
merely
as
signals
for
discharge
this
subdivision
contains
several
types
of
reactions
which
seem
to
be
dependent
upon
the
phenomenon
of
perseveration
it
contains
also
the
rather
important
type
of
neologisms
the
phenomenon
of
occurs
in
cases
in
which
one
may
observe
an
abnormal
immobility
of
attention
to
react
normally
to
a
series
of
stimulus
words
requires
on
the
part
of
the
subject
in
the
first
place
a
certain
alertness
in
order
that
he
may
grasp
quickly
and
clearly
the
meaning
of
each
word
and
in
the
second
place
a
prompt
shifting
of
the
mind
from
one
reaction
to
the
next
when
such
mental
mobility
is
lacking
the
subject
is
liable
to
react
not
by
a
response
adjusted
to
the
stimulus
word
but
either
by
repeating
a
previous
stimulus
or
reaction
or
by
giving
a
word
associated
to
the
preceding
stimulus
or
reaction
the
names
of
the
different
types
of
reactions
included
under
the
heading
of
perseveration
are
sufficiently
descriptive
we
shall
here
refer
only
to
those
which
require
further
definition
to

here
is
placed

reaction
that
is
shown
by

be
attained
by
systematically
excluding
any
reaction
the
relationship
of
which
to
the
preceding
reaction
is
subject
to
any
considerable
doubt
and
by
placing
any
such
reaction
in
the
unclassified
group
of
previous
stimulus
here
we
place
any
reaction
which
is
a
repetition
of
any
previous
stimulus
from
amongst
the
ten
next
preceding
at
the
same
time
placing
of
preceding
under
a
separate
heading
here
we
place
the
newly
coined
words
so
commonly
given
by
the
insane
excepting
such
as
possess
a
sound
relationship
to
the
stimulus
word
for
which
as
already
stated
a
special
place
in
the
classification
has
been
provided
neologisms
might
be
divided
into
three
types
as
follows
those
which
arise
from
ignorance
of
language
uncomfort
short
distortions
of
actual
words
apparently
of
pathological
origin
and
not
due
to
ignorance
foodation
thief
and
those
which
seem
to
be
without
any
meaning
whatever
gehimper
hanrow
it
is
however
impossible
to
draw
distinctions
between
these
types
and
for
this
reason
we
have
made
no
provision
in
our
classification
for
such
division
reactions
this
group
is
important
in
the
first
place
because
it
is
numerically
a
large
one
and
in
the
second
place
because
it
contains
certain
fairly
definite
types
of
reactions
which
are
placed
here
for
the
sole
reason
that
we
have
not
been
able
to
find
strictly
objective
criteria
for
their
differentiation
from
other
types
it
has
already
been
stated
that
the
frequency
tables
even
together
with
the
appendix
fail
to
exhaust
all
normal
possibilities
of
association
so
that
a
certain
small
number
of
perfectly
normal
reactions
must
fall
into
the
unclassified
group
we
submit
the
following
examples
another
type
of
reactions
found
in
the
unclassified
group
though
also
normal
yet
not
obviously
so
until
explained
by
the
subject
is
represented
by
those
which
originate
from
purely
personal
experiences
such
as
the
following
given
by
normal
subjects
t
j
the
first
of
these
reactions
is
explained
by
the
subject
acquaintance
with
a
young
lady
miss
t
who
has
been
blossom
and
the
second
is
explained
by
the
subject
having
among
her
pupils
at
school
a
boy
by
the
name
of
j
hammer
it
would
be
difficult
to
estimate
the
proportion
of
such
reactions
in
the
unclassified
group
but
we
have
gained
the
general
impression
that
it
is
small
an
attempt
to
place
them
in
a
separate
group
could
be
made
only
with
the
aid
of
explanations
from
the
subjects
such
aid
in
the
case
of
insane
subjects
is
generally
unreliable
moreover
to
class
these
reactions
as
strictly
normal
would
perhaps
be
going
too
far
since
their
general
value
is
obviously
inferior
to
that
of
the
common
reactions
and
in
any
case
in
which
they
are
given
in
unusually
large
numbers
they
must
be
regarded
as
manifestation
of
a
tendency
to
depart
from
the
normal
to
the
extent
to
which
they
displace
common
reactions
the
next
type
of
reactions
met
with
in
the
unclassified
group
is
characterized
by
a
peculiarly
superficial
or
or
purely
relationship
to
the
stimulus
such
reactions
though
occasionally
given
by
normal
subjects
are
more
often
given
by
insane
ones
and
seem
to
be
somewhat
characteristic
of
states
of
mental
deterioration
which
are
clinically
rather
loosely
described
as
puerilism
we
offer
the
following
examples
given
by
normal
subjects
still
another
type
of
reactions
to
be
considered
in
this
connection
consists
of
words
which
are
in
no
way
related
to
the
corresponding
stimulus
words
but
which
arise
from
of
the
subject
by
surrounding
objects
sounds
and
the
like
in
some
cases
the
experimenter
may
be
able
to
judge
from
the
direction
of
the
gaze
from
a
listening
attitude
and
so
on
that
certain
reactions
are
due
to
distraction
in
other
cases
particularly
in
cases
of
normal
subjects
the
fact
that
certain
reactions
are
due
to
distraction
may
be
determined
by
questioning
the
subject
on
this
point
immediately
after
making
the
test
in
work
with
insane
subjects
as
we
have
several
times
had
occasion
to
point
out
such
aid
is
generally
not
available
the
group
of
unclassified
reactions
includes
also
one
more
type
of
reactions
which
are
of
great
importance
both
numerically
and
otherwise
these
are
the
that
is
to
say
reactions
which
are
determined
neither
by
the
stimulus
words
nor
by
the
agency
of
perseveration
nor
by
distraction
although
the
occurrence
of
incoherent
reactions
is
hardly
subject
to
doubt
yet
in
no
instance
is
it
possible
to
establish
with
certainty
that
a
given
reaction
is
of
this
type
for
in
no
instance
can
a
remote
or
an
imagined
or
a
merely
symbolic
relationship
between
stimulus
and
reaction
be
positively
excluded
some
indeed
would
assert
that
some
such
relationship
must
necessarily
exist
in
every
instance
at
least
in
the
domain
of
the
subconscious
this
circumstance
necessitates
the
placing
of
this
type
of
reactions
in
the
unclassified
group
in
practice
it
may
be
found
advisable
in
some
cases
to
analyze
the
unclassified
reactions
with
a
view
to
ascertaining
to
what
extent
each
of
the
various
types
is
represented
among
them
but
one
here
treads
on
slippery
ground
and
one
must
be
continually
warned
against
the
danger
of
erroneous
conclusions
order
of
preference
after
having
developed
the
classification
here
proposed
we
found
that
there
was
still
considerable
room
for
difference
of
opinion
in
the
placing
of
many
reactions
owing
to
the
circumstance
that
in
many
cases
a
reaction
presents
features
which
render
it
assignable
under
any
one
of
two
or
more
headings
to
leave
the
matter
of
preference
in
grouping
to
be
decided
in
each
case
according
to
the
best
judgment
of
the
experimenter
would
mean
introducing
again
the
play
of
personal
equation
and
would
thus
court
failure
of
all
our
efforts
to
accomplish
a
standardization
of
the
association
test
therefore
the
necessity
of
establishing
a
proper
order
of
preference
for
guidance
in
the
application
of
the
classification
became
to
us
quite
apparent
in
the
arrangement
of
the
order
of
preference
we
were
guided
mainly
by
two
principles
namely
i
as
between
two
groups
of
unequal
definition
the
one
which
is
more
clearly
defined
and
which
therefore
leaves
less
play
for
personal
equation
is
to
be
preferred
as
between
two
groups
of
equal
definition
the
one
which
possesses
the
greater
pathological
significance
is
to
be
preferred
in
accordance
with
these
principles
we
have
adopted
the
order
of
preference
shown
in
table
placing
every
reaction
under
the
highest
heading
on
the

under
which
it
may
be
properly
classed

involved
in

it
may
readily
be
seen
that
such
definiteness
and
uniformity
as
this
classification
possesses
results
from
the
introduction
of
more
or
less
arbitrary
criteria
for
the
differentiation
of
the
various
types
of
reactions
the
question
might
arise
to
what
extent
do
the
distinctions
thus
made
correspond
to
reality
to
consider
for
instance
our
rule
for
the
placing
of
sound
reactions
per
cent
of
the
sounds
of
the
shorter
word
to
be
present
in
the
same
order
in
the
other
word
when
a
given
reaction
is
in
accordance
with
the
rule
assigned
under
the
heading
of
sound
reactions
can
it
be
assumed
that
sound
similarity
and
not
some
other
relationship
is
the
determining
factor
of
the
association
in
question
or
when
in
a
given
instance
the
sound
similarity
falls
somewhat
short
of
the
standard
required
by
the
rule
can
it
be
assumed
that
sound
similarity
is
not
after
all
the
determining
factor
similar
questions
may
of
course
arise
in
connection
with
other
subdivisions
it
must
indeed
be
conceded
that
objective
methods
can
reveal
but
indirectly
and
with
uncertainty
the
inner
mechanism
which
produces
any
association
and
that
in
any
given
instance
it
would
be
impossible
to
establish
the
correctness
of
grouping
in
accordance
with
such
methods
however
to
decide
that
question
for
any
given
reaction
is
really
not
necessary
in
practice
since
an
error
made
through
wrongly
placing
one
two
or
three
reactions
tinder
any
heading
is
of
no
significance
the
types
acquire
importance
only
when
represented
by
large
numbers
in
a
record
under
consideration
and
when
many
reactions
fall
tinder
a
single
heading
the
likelihood
of
error
as
affecting
the
record
as
a
whole
is
by
that
fact
alone
greatly
reduced
the
whole
question
might
more
profitably
be
approached
from
another
point
of
view
to
what
extent
are
the
distinctions
of
this
classification
useful
an
answer
to
this
question
can
be
found
only
in
the
results

of

material

present
in

results
of
a
statistical
examination
of
the
records
obtained
from
certain
groups
of
normal
subjects
and
from
some
groups
of
insane
subjects
the
normal
groups
have
been
studied
for
the
purpose
of
determining
the
frequency
and
manner
of
occurrence
among
normal
subjects
of
the
various
of
abnormal
reactions
it
seemed
best
for
this
purpose
to
consider
separately
the
records
of
those
subjects
who
gave
an
unusually
large

a
further
examination
of
the
individual
test
records
shows
that
there
is
no
uniformity
of
associational
tendencies
in
this
clinical
group
but
that
several
tendencies
are
more
or
less
frequently
met
with
either
alone
or
in
various
combinations
yet
some
of
these
tendencies
when
appearing
at
all
prominently
are
so
highly
characteristic
of
dementia
præcox
as
to
be
almost
pathognomonic
among
these
may
be
mentioned
the
tendency
to
give
particularly
those
of
the
senseless
type
the
tendency
to
give
unclassified
reactions
largely
of
the
type
and
the
tendency
toward
manifested
chiefly
by
abnormally
frequent
repetitions
of
the
same
reaction
fairly
characteristic
also
is
the
occasional
tendency
to
give
sound
reactions
again
occasionally
one
encounters
pronounced
and
at
least
two
of
our
subjects
gave
a
good
many
unclassified
reactions
obviously
due
to
it
must
be
noted
that
not
infrequently
cases
of
dementia
præcox
give
test
records
that
can
not
be
distinguished
from
normal
it
seems
that
the
pathological
associational
tendencies
constitute
merely
a
special
group
of
symptoms
some
of
which
may
be
expected
to
be
manifest
in
cases
which
have
reached
a
state
of
advanced
mental
deterioration
but
may
not
necessarily
be
present
in
the
early
stages
of
the
disease
on
the
other
hand
there
is
evidence
to
show
that
these
tendencies
may
in
some
cases
appear
among
the
earliest
manifestations
this
matter
will
be
referred
to
again
thus
the
test
records
of
dementia
præcox
depart
from
the
normal
not
sharply
but
by
a
gradual
shading
off
we
find
similar
gradual
transitions
between
dementia
præcox
and
other
psychoses
for
this
work
we
selected
cases
in
which
the
diagnoses
were
established
with
reasonable
certainty
whether
or
not
in
cases
of
doubtful
clinical
classification
this
association
test
may
be
of
aid
in
determining
the
diagnosis
is
a
question
that
must
for
the
present
remain
open

the

under
the
designation
paranoic
conditions
is
far
from
being
homogeneous
we
have
here
cases
that
are
more
or
less

allied
to
the
paranoid
form
of
dementia
præcox
other
cases
that
are
apparently
dependent
upon
involutional
changes
kraepelin
still
other
cases
that
are
characterized
by
absence
or
at
least
delay
of
mental
deterioration
etc
in
some
of
these
cases
disturbance
of
the
flow
of
utterance
is
not
observed
and
the

obtained

them
present
no
striking
abnormalities
distinctly
pathological
records
are
obtained
mainly
from
those
cases
which
clinically
resemble
dementia
præcox
in
these
records
the
nature
of
the
pathological
reactions
would
seem
to
indicate
that
the
diagnosis
of
dementia
præcox
would
be
more
justifiable
than
that
of

epilepsy
most
of
the
cases
of
epilepsy
in
our
collection
show
advanced
dementia
and
in
some
the
clinical
history
would
indicate
also
original
mental
inferiority
that
is
to
say
imbecility
or
in
these
cases
the
dominant
characteristic
so
far
as
shown
in
the
test
records
seems
to
be
a
narrowing
of
the
mental
horizon
manifested
firstly
by
a
tendency
to
repeat
many
times
one
or
another
word
and
secondly
by
an
abnormally
pronounced
tendency
to
make
use
of
reactions
or
particles
of
speech
occasionally
other
abnormalities
are
noted
such
as
perseveration

insanity
in
this
disorder
the
departures
from
the
normal
seem
to
be
less
pronounced
than
in
the
psychoses
considered
above
the
number
of
individual
reactions
is
in
most
cases
not
greatly
above
the
normal
average
and
so
far
as
their
character
is
concerned
we
find
that
many
of
them
are
classed
as
normal
in
accordance
with
the
appendix
to
the
frequency
tables
among
the
unclassified
reactions
which
are
quite
frequent
here
we
find
mostly
either
obviously
normal
ones
or
some
of
the
type
to
which
we
have
already
referred
as
while
others
among
them
are
circumstantial
see
further
we
find
that
most
of
the
remaining
individual
reactions
fall
into
the
general
group
of
partial
dissociation
reactions
sound
reactions
word
complements
and
particles
in
some
cases
the
only
abnormality
that
is
found
is
that
of
an
undue
tendency
to
respond
by
reactions
most
of
them
being
common
and
there
being
no
excessive
number
of
individual
reactions
it
would
seem
legitimate
to
assume
that
this
tendency
is
here
to
be
regarded
as
a
manifestation
of
the
phenomenon
which
is
clinically
described
as
of
it
is
significant
that
this
tendency
is
observed
not
only
in
depressive
phases
of
the
psychosis
but
also
in
manic
phases
and
even
in
the
normal
intervals
of
recurrent
cases
or
after
apparent
recovery
in
acute
cases
this
will
be
seen
from
some
of
the
test
records
which
are
here
reproduced
occasionally
cases
are
met
with
which
give
a
large
number
of
unclassified
reactions
seemingly
incoherent
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
at
least
some
of
these
cases
are
clinically
perfectly
typical
ones
of
insanity
yet
the
test
records
strongly
resemble
in
some
respects
those
of
dementia
præcox
since
clinically
the
distinction
between
typical
cases
of
these
psychoses
can
be
so
clearly
made
on
the
basis
of
the
disorders
of
the
flow
of
thought
respectively
characterizing
them
it
could
hardly
be
assumed
that
the
associational
disturbances
in
these
two
groups
of
cases
are
truly
related
although
there
may
be
an
apparent
resemblance
it
must
be
acknowledged
that
we
are
here
confronted
with
one
of
the
most
serious
shortcomings

the

there
are
so
few
cases
of
these
psychoses
in
our
series
that
we
can
say
but
little
concerning
their
associational
disorders
in
table
we
show
all
the
types
of
reactions
given
by
each
subject
we
have
not
observed
in
our
cases
of
any
undue
tendency
to
give
individual
reactions
the
records
are
either
perfectly
normal
or
slightly
abnormal
in
that
they
show
an
increase
of
the
common
reactions
in
this
respect
they
resemble
strongly
the
records
obtained
from
some
cases
of
insanity
this
similarity
is
of
interest
in
connection
with
other
evidence
recently
brought
to
light
showing
that
involutional
melancholia
is
closely
related
to
insanity
if
not
identical

it

pathological

from

subjects
mental
disorders
do
not
always
so
manifest
themselves
as
to
incapacitate
the
subject
for
his
work
or
to
necessitate
his
sequestration
in
a
hospital
for
the
insane
it
is
therefore
not
surprising
that
in
applying
the
association
test
to
over
a
thousand
subjects
selected
at
random
we
have
obtained
a
small
number
of
test
records
which
show
various
types
of
abnormal
reactions
among

number
of
different
words
given
as
reactions
it
has
been
suggested
by
fuhrmann
that
the
number
of
different
words
given
in
response
to
one
hundred
selected
stimulus
words
may
be
used
as
a
fairly
reliable
measure
of
the
intelligence
and
degree
of
education
of
a
patient
the
test
according
to
fuhrmann
is
applied
twice
in
every
case
the
interval
between
the
two
sittings
being
at
least
four
weeks
in
very
intelligent
and
well
educated
persons
every
stimulus
words
almost
always
evokes
in
the
first
test
different
associations
in
the
less
intelligent
and
in
the
the
same
associations
are
more
frequently
repeated
in
the
second
test
with
the
same
stimulus
words
which
is
really
much
more
important
than
the
first
since
even
persons
or
inferior
intelligence
may
reach
higher
numbers
in
the
first
test
the
difference
in
the
wealth
of
the
stock
of
representations
becomes
plainly
evident
the
man
of
intelligence
will
not
need
to
draw
on
the
associations
which
he
gave
in
the
first
test
but
will
produce
new
ones
the
subject
will
on
the
contrary
repeat
to
a
greater
or
lesser
extent
the
associations
of
the
first
test
in
general
the
associational
capacity
of
an
adult
person
may
be
taken
to
be
from
per
cent
to
per
cent
should
the
number
sink
below
per
cent
the
suspicion
of
a
pathological
condition
must
then
arise
and
the
higher
the
subject
degree
of
education
the
stronger
is
this
suspicion
in
the
case
of
an
associational
capacity
of
per
cent
or
less
no
doubt
of
its
pathological
significance
can
remain
any
longer

our
results
are
not
strictly
comparable
with
fuhrmann
because
we
have
obtained
but
one
test
record
from
each
subject
it
may
be
said
however
that
the
results
of
a
single
test
in
each
case
do
not
show
any
considerable
differences
corresponding
to
education
or
age
in
the
variety
of
responses
further
dementing
psychoses
with
the
exception
of
epilepsy
show
on
the
whole
no
diminution
in
the
number
of
different
reactions
although
in
individual
cases
this
number
falls
considerably
below
the
general
average
and
in
such
cases
the
diminution
may
be
dependent
upon
stereotypy
or
perseveration
and
not
necessarily
upon
reduction
in
the
stock
of
representations
it
would
appear
from
our
results
that
pathological
mental
states
are
apt
to
manifest
themselves
by
a
tendency
to
give
reactions
belonging
to
types
of
inferior
values
rather
than
by
diminished
variety
of
responses
we
show
in

the
numbers
of
different
responses
given
by
our

of
the
subject
in
our
work
with
insane
subjects
we
encountered
many
cases
in
which
we
were
unable
to
obtain
satisfactory
test
records
owing
to
lack
of
proper
some
subjects
seemed
to
be
either
too
confused
or
too
demented
to
be
capable
of
understanding
and
following
the
instructions
given
them
others
were
for
one
reason
or
another
unwilling
to
it
is
important
to
distinguish
inability
from
unwillingness
to
since
the
former
indicates
in
itself
an
abnormal
state
of
the
mind
while
the
latter
is
quite
often
shown
by
normal
persons
a
subject
may
to
the
extent
of
giving
a
single
word
in
response
to
each
stimulus
word
and
yet
fail
to
in
some
other
particulars
he
may
instead
of
giving
the
first
word
suggested
to
him
by
the
stimulus
suppress
the
first
word
more
or
less
systematically
and
give
some
other
word
which
may
seem
to
him
more
appropriate
this
probably
occurs
very
often
but
does
not
seem
to
render
the
results
less
serviceable
for
our
purpose
further
a
subject
may
react
by
words
related
not
to
the
stimulus
words
but
to
each
other
thus
simulating
perseveration
or
he
may
react
by
naming
objects
within
reach
of
the
senses
thus
appearing
to
be
distracted
or
he
may
give
only
sound
reactions
there
is
in
fact
no
type
of
pathological
reactions
which
a
normal
person
may
not
be
able
to
produce
more
or
less
readily
at
will
though
in
the
case
of
incoherent
reactions
considerable
mental
effort
may
be
required
and
the
end
may
be
attained
only
by
regularly
rejecting
the
first
and
some
subsequent
words
which
are
suggested
by
the
stimulus
in
view
of
these
considerations
we
are
led
to
conclude
that
the
association
test
as
applied
by
our
method
could
not
be
relied
upon
as
a
means
of
detecting
simulation
of
insanity
in
malingerers
criminals
and
the
like
summary
the
normal
range
of
reaction
in
response
to
any
of
our
stimulus
words
is
largely
confined
within
narrow
limits
the
frequency
tables
compiled
from
test
records
given
by
one
thousand
normal
subjects
comprise
over
ninety
per
cent
of
the
normal
range
in
the
average
case
with
the
aid
of
the
frequency
tables
and
the
appendix
normal
reactions
with
a
very
few
exceptions
can
be
sharply
distinguished
from
pathological
ones
the
separation
of
pathological
reactions
from
normal
ones
simplifies
the
task
of
their
analysis
and
makes
possible
the
application
of
a
classification
based
on
objective
criteria
by
the
application
of
the
association
test
according
to
the
method
here
proposed
no
sharp
distinction
can
be
drawn
between
mental
health
and
mental
disease
a
large
collection
of
material
shows
a
gradual
and
not
an
abrupt
transition
from
the
normal
state
to
pathological
states
in
dementia
præcox
some
paranoic
conditions
insanity
general
paresis
and
epileptic
dementia
the
test
reveals
some
characteristic
though
not
pathognomonic
associational
tendencies
acknowledgments

is
with
pleasure
that
we
