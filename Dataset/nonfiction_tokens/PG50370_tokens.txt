to

it

of

if
our

is
confined
to
those
whose
fame
has
been
won
in
the
house
alone
it
will
be
small
for
members
of
the
house
are
mostly
birds
of
passage
only
perching
on
the
way
to
another
place
few
remain
so
as
to
become
identified
with
the
house
or
their
service
there
is
forgotten
in
the
blaze
of
service
elsewhere
as
was
the
case
with
madison
marshall
clay
webster
and
lincoln
it
is
not
difficult
to
see
who
will
find
a
place
in
this
small
company
there
must
be
a
statue
of
josiah
quincy
whose
series
of
eloquent
speeches
is
the
most
complete
of
our
history
before
webster
pleaded
for
greece
and
also
a
statue
of
joshua
giddings
whose
faithful
championship
of
freedom
throughout
a
long
and
terrible
conflict
makes
him
one
of
the
great
names
of
our
country
and
there
must
be
a
statue
of
thaddeus
stevens
who
was
perhaps
the
most
remarkable
character
identified
with
the
house
unless
we
except
john
quincy
adams
but
the
fame
of
the
latter
is
not
of
a
representative
alone
for
he
was
already
illustrious
from
various
service
before
he
entered
the
house
all
of
these
hated
slavery
and
labored
for
its
overthrow
on
this
account
they
were
a
mark
for
obloquy
and
were
generally
in
a
minority
already
compensation
has
begun
as
the
cause
they
upheld
so
bravely
is
exalted
so
is
their
fame
by
the
side
of
their
and
heroic
efforts
how
diminutive
is
all
that
was
done
by
others
at
the
time
how
vile
the
spirit
that
raged
against
them
stevens
was
a
child
of
new
england
as
were
quincy
and
adams
but
after
completing
his
education
he
found
a
home
in
pennsylvania
which
had
already
given
birth
to
giddings
if
this
great
central
state
can
claim
one
of
these
remarkable
men
by
adoption
only
it
may
claim
the
other
by
maternity
their
names
are
among
its
best
glories
two
things
stevens
did
for
his
adopted
state
by
which
he
repaid
largely
all
her
hospitality
and
favor
he
taught
her
to
cherish
education
for
the
people
and
he
taught
her
respect
for
human
rights
the
latter
lesson
was
slower
learned
than
the
former
in
the
prime
of
life
when
his
faculties
were
in
their
highest
vigor
he
became
conspicuous
for
earnest
effort
crowned
by
most
persuasive
speech
whose
echoes
have
not
yet
died
away
for
those
common
schools
which
more
even
than
railways
are
handmaids
of
civilization
besides
being
the
true
support
of
republican
government
his
powerful
word
turned
the
scale
and
a
great
cause
was
won
this
same
powerful
word
was
given
promptly
and
without
hesitation
to
that
other
cause
suffering
then
from
constant
and
most
cruel
outrage
here
he
stood
always
like
a
pillar
suffice
it
to
say
that
he
was
one
of
the
earliest
of
abolitionists
accepting
the
name
and
bearing
the
reproach
not
a
child
in
pennsylvania
conning
a
beneath
the
humble
rafters
of
a
village
school
who
does
not
owe
him
gratitude
not
a
citizen
rejoicing
in
that
security
obtained
only
in
liberal
institutions
founded
on
the
equal
rights
of
all
who
is
not
his
debtor
when
he
entered
congress
it
was
as
champion
his
conclusions
were
already
matured
and
he
saw
his
duty
plain
before
him
the
english
poet
foreshadows
him
when
he
pictures
in
whom
persuasion
and
belief
had
ripened
into
faith
and
faith
become
a
passionate
slavery
was
wrong
and
he
would
not
tolerate
it
brimming
with
slavery
were
imperious
and
lawless
from
him
they
learned
to
see
themselves
as
others
saw
them
strong
in
his
cause
and
in
the
consciousness
of
power
he
did
not
shrink
from
encounter
and
when
it
was
joined
he
used
not
only
argument
and
history
but
all
those
other
weapons
by
which
a
bad
cause
is
exposed
to
scorn
and
contempt
nobody
said
more
in
fewer
words
or
gave
to
language
a
sharper
bite
speech
was
with
him
at
times
a
and
woe
to
the
victim
on
whom
the
terrible
lash
descended
does
any
one
doubt
the
justifiableness
of
such
debate
sarcasm
satire
and
ridicule
are
not
given
in
vain
they
have
an
office
to
perform
in
the
economies
of
life
they
are
faculties
to
be
employed
prudently
in
support
of
truth
and
justice
a
good
cause
is
helped
if
its
enemies
are
driven
back
and
it
can
not
be
doubted
that
the
supporters
of
wrong
and
the
procrastinators
shrank
often
before
the
weapons
he
wielded
soft
words
turn
away
wrath
but
there
is
a
time
for
strong
words
as
for
soft
words
did
not
the
saviour
seize
the
thongs
with
which
to
drive
the
from
the
temple
our
long
ago
planted
themselves
within
our
temple
was
it
not
right
to
lash
them
away
such
an
exercise
of
power
in
a
generous
cause
must
not
be
confounded
with
that
personality
of
debate
which
has
its
origin
in
nothing
higher
than
irritability
jealousy
or
spite
in
this
sense
thaddeus
stevens
was
never
personal
no
personal
thought
or
motive
controlled
him
what
he
said
was
for
his
country
and
mankind
as
the
rebellion
assumed
its
giant
proportions
he
saw
clearly
that
it
could
be
smitten
only
through
slavery
and
when
after
a
bloody
struggle
it
was
too
tardily
vanquished
he
saw
clearly
that
there
could
be
no
true
peace
except
by
new
governments
built
on
the
equal
rights
of
all
and
this
policy
he
urged
with
a
lofty
dogmatism
as
beneficent
as
uncompromising
the
rebels
had
burned
his
property
in
pennsylvania
and
there
were
weaklings
who
attributed
his
conduct
to
smart
at
pecuniary
loss
how
little
they
understood
his
nature
injury
provokes
and
sometimes
excuses
resentment
but
it
was
not
in
him
to
allow
private
grief
to
influence
public
conduct
the
losses
of
the
were
forgotten
in
the
duties
of
the
statesman
he
asked
nothing
for
himself
he
did
not
ask
his
own
rights
except
as
the
rights
of
man
i
know
not
if
he
could
be
called
orator
perhaps
like
fox
he
were
better
called
debater
and
yet
i
doubt
if
words
were
ever
delivered
with
more
effect
than
when
broken
with
years
and
decay
he
stood
before
the
senate
and
in
the
name
of
the
house
of
representatives
and
of
all
the
people
of
the
united
states
impeached
andrew
johnson
president
of
the
united
states
of
high
crimes
and
misdemeanors
in
office
who
can
forget
his
steady
solemn
utterance
of
this
great
arraignment
the
words
were
few
but
they
will
sound
through
the
ages
the
personal
triumph
in
his
position
at
that
moment
was
merged
in
the
historic
grandeur
of
the
scene
for
a
long
time
against
opposition
of
all
kinds
against
misconceptions
of
the
law
and
against
apologies
for
transactions
without
apology
he
had
insisted
on
impeachment
and
now
this
old
man
tottering
to
your
door
dragged
the
chief
magistrate
of
the
republic
to
judgment
it
was
he
who
did
this
thing
and
i
should
do
poor
justice
to
his
life
if
on
this
occasion
i
failed
to
declare
my
gratitude
for
the
heroic
deed
his
merit
is
none
the
less
because
other
influences
prevailed
in
the
end
his
example
will
remain
forever
in
the
house
which
was
the
scene
of
his
triumphs
i
never
heard
him
but
once
and
i
can
not
forget
the
noble
eloquence
of
that
brief
speech
i
was
there
by
accident
just
as
he
rose
he
did
not
speak
more
than
ten
minutes
but
every
sentence
seemed
an
oration
with
unhesitating
plainness
he
arraigned
pennsylvania
for
her
denial
of
equal
rights
to
an
oppressed
race
and
rising
with
the
theme
declared
that
this
state
had
not
a
republican
government
his
explicitness
was
the
more
striking
because
he
was
a
representative
of
pennsylvania
nobody
who
has
considered
with
any
care
what
constitutes
a
republican
government
especially
since
the
definition
supplied
by
our
declaration
of
independence
can
doubt
that
he
was
right
his
words
will
live
as
the
courageous
testimony
of
a
great
character
on
this
important
question
the
last
earnest
object
of
his
life
was
the
establishment
of
equal
rights
throughout
the
whole
country
by
the
recognition
of
the
requirement
of
the
declaration
of
independence
i
have
before
me
two
letters
in
which
he
records
his
convictions
which
are
perhaps
more
weighty
because
the
result
of
most
careful
consideration
when
age
had
furnished
experience
and
tempered
the
judgment
have
says
he
and
with
such
ability
as
i
could
command
reflected
upon
the
subject
of
the
declaration
of
independence
and
finally
have
come
to
the
sincere
conclusion
that
universal
suffrage
was
one
of
the
inalienable
rights
intended
to
be
embraced
in
that
it
is
difficult
to
see
how
there
can
be
hesitation
on
this
point
when
the
great
expressly
says
that
governments
derive
their
just
powers
from
the
consent
of
the
governed
but
this
is
not
the
only
instance
in
which
he
was
constrained
by
the
habits
of
that
profession
which
he
practised
so
successfully
a
great
parliamentarian
of
france
has
said
more
one
is
a
lawyer
the
less
he
is
a
senator
on
est
avocat
moins
on
est
if
stevens
reached
his
conclusion
slowly
it
was
because
he
had
not
completely
emancipated
himself
from
that
technical
reasoning
which
is
the
boast
of
the
lawyer
rather
than
of
the
statesman
the
pretension
that
the
power
to
determine
the
of
voters
embraced
the
power
to
exclude
for
color
and
that
this
same
power
to
exclude
for
color
was
included
in
the
asserted
power
of
the
states
to
make
for
the
elective
franchise
seems
at
first
to
have
deceived
him
as
if
it
were
not
insulting
to
reason
and
shocking
to
the
moral
sense
to
suppose
that
any
unalterable
physical
condition
such
as
color
of
hair
eyes
or
skin
could
be
a
and
as
if
it
were
not
equally
offensive
to
suppose
that
under
a
power
to
determine
or
to
make
a
race
could
be
disfranchised
of
course
this
whole
pretension
is
a
technicality
set
up
against
human
rights
nothing
can
be
plainer
than
that
a
technicality
may
be
employed
in
favor
of
human
rights
but
never
against
them
stevens
came
to
his
conclusion
at
last
and
rested
in
it
firmly
his
final
aspiration
was
to
see
it
prevail
he
had
seen
much
for
which
he
had
striven
embodied
in
the
institutions
of
his
country
he
had
seen
slavery
abolished
he
had
seen
the
freedman
of
the
national
capital
lifted
to
equality
of
political
rights
by
act
of
congress
he
had
seen
the
colored
race
throughout
the
whole
land
lifted
to
equality
of
civil
rights
by
act
of
congress
it
only
remained
that
he
should
see
them
throughout
the
whole
land
lifted
to
the
same
equality
in
political
rights
and
then
the
promises
of
the
declaration
of
independence
would
be
all
fulfilled
but
he
was
called
away
before
this
final
triumph
a
great
writer
of
antiquity
a
perpetual
authority
tells
us
that
chief
duty
of
friends
is
not
to
follow
the
departed
with
idle
lamentation
but
to
remember
their
wishes
and
to
execute
their
these
are
the
words
of
tacitus
i
venture
to
add
that
we
shall
best
honor
him
we
now
celebrate
if
we
adopt
his
aspiration
and
strive
for
its
fulfilment
it
is
as
defender
of
human
rights
that
thaddeus
stevens
deserves
homage
here
he
is
supreme
on
other
questions
he
erred
on
the
finances
his
errors
were
signal
but
history
will
forget
these
and
other
failings
as
it
bends
with
reverence
before
the
exalted
labors
by
which
humanity
has
been
advanced
already
he
takes
his
place
among
illustrious
names
which
are
the
common
property
of
mankind
i
see
him
now
as
so
often
during
life
his
venerable
form
moves
slowly
and
with
uncertain
steps
but
the
gathered
strength
of
years
is
in
his
countenance
and
the
light
of
victory
on
his
path
politician
calculator
timeserver
stand
aside
a
passes
to
his
reward
claims
of
citizens
in
the
rebel
states
speeches
in

senate
january
and
president
this
discussion
so
unexpectedly
prolonged
has
already
brought
us
to
see
two
things
first
the
magnitude
of
the
interests
involved
and
secondly
the
simplicity
of
the
principle
which
must
determine
our
judgment
it
is
difficult
to
exaggerate
the
amount
of
claims
which
will
be
let
loose
to
feed
on
the
country
if
you
recognize
that
now
before
us
nor
can
i
imagine
anything
more
authoritative
than
the
principle
which
bars
all
these
claims
except
so
far
as
congress
in
its
bounty
chooses
to
recognize
them
by
the
report
of
the
committee
on
claims
it
appears
that
the
house
of
miss
sue
murphey
of
decatur
alabama
was
destroyed
so
that
not
a
vestige
remained
by
order
of
the
commander
at
that
place
on
the
march
under
instructions
from
general
sherman
to
make
it
a
military
post
it
is
also
stated
that
miss
murphey
was
loyal
these
are
the
important
facts
assuming
the
loyalty
of
the
petitioner
which
i
have
been
led
to
doubt
the
simple
question
is
whether
the
nation
is
bound
to
indemnify
a
citizen
domiciled
in
a
rebel
state
for
property
in
that
state
taken
for
the
building
of
a
fort
by
the
united
states
against
the
rebels
here
it
is
proper
to
observe
three
things
one
concerning
the
petitioner
and
two
concerning
the
property
taken
first
that
the
petitioner
was
domiciled
in
a
rebel
state
or
to
use
more
technical
language
in
a
state
declared
by
public
proclamation
to
be
in
rebellion
secondly
that
the
property
was
situated
within
the
rebel
state
and
thirdly
that
the
property
was
taken
under
the
necessities
of
war
and
for
the
national
defence
on
these
three
several
points
there
can
be
no
question
they
are
facts
which
have
not
been
denied
in
this
debate
thus
far
i
confine
myself
to
a
statement
of
facts
in
order
to
prepare
the
way
for
the
consideration
of
the
legal
consequences
bearing
in
mind
these
facts
several
difficulties
which
have
been
presented
during
this
debate
disappear
for
instance
a
question
was
put
by
a
learned
senator
davis
of
kentucky
as
to
the
validity
of
an
imagined
seizure
of
the
property
of
the
eminent
judge
wayne
situated
in
the
district
of
columbia
but
it
is
obvious
that
the
facts
in
the
imagined
case
of
the
eminent
judge
are
different
from
those
in
the
actual
case
before
us
judge
wayne
unlike
the
petitioner
was
domiciled
in
a
loyal
part
of
the
country
and
his
property
unlike
that
of
the
petitioner
was
situated
in
a
loyal
part
of
the
country
this
difference
between
the
two
cases
serves
to
illustrate
the
position
of
the
petitioner
because
property
situated
in
the
district
of
columbia
and
belonging
to
a
loyal
judge
domiciled
here
could
not
be
taken
it
by
no
means
follows
that
property
situated
in
a
rebel
state
and
belonging
to
a
person
domiciled
there
can
enjoy
the
same
immunity
behind
the
fact
of
domicile
and
the
fact
that
the
property
was
situated
in
a
rebel
state
is
that
other
fact
equally
incontrovertible
that
it
was
taken
in
the
exigencies
of
war
the
military
order
under
which
the
taking
occurred
declares
that
necessities
of
the
army
require
the
use
of
every
building
in
decatur
not
merely
the
building
in
question
but
every
building
and
the
report
of
the
committee
says
that
sherman
had
previously
issued
an
order
to
fortify
decatur
for
a
military
i
might
quote
more
to
illustrate
this
point
but
i
quote
enough
it
is
plain
and
indisputable
that
the
taking
was
under
an
exigency
of
war
to
deny
this
is
to
assail
the
military
order
under
which
it
was
done
and
also
the
report
of
the
committee
three
men
once
governed
the
mighty
roman
world
three
facts
govern
the
present
case
with
the
power
of
a
triumvirate
the
domicile
of
the
petitioner
the
situation
of
the
property
and
the
exigency
of
war
if
i
dwell
on
these
three
facts
it
is
because
i
am
unwilling
that
either
should
drop
out
of
sight
each
is
important
together
they
present
a
case
which
it
is
easy
to
decide
however
painful
the
conclusion
and
this
brings
me
to
the
principle
which
i
said
at
the
beginning
was
so
simple
indeed
let
the
facts
be
admitted
and
it
is
difficult
to
see
how
there
can
be
any
question
in
the
present
case
but
the
facts
as
i
have
stated
them
are
indubitable
on
these
facts
two
questions
arise
first
as
to
the
rule
of
international
law
applicable
to
property
of
persons
domiciled
in
an
enemy
country
and
secondly
as
to
the
applicability
of
this
rule
to
the
present
case
of
the
rule
there
can
be
no
question
its
applicability
is
sustained
by
reason
and
also
by
authority
from
which
there
can
be
no
appeal
in
stating
and
enforcing
the
rule
i
might
array
writers
precedents
and
courts
but
i
content
myself
with
a
paragraph
from
a
writer
who
in
expounding
the
laws
of
war
is
perhaps
the
highest
authority
i
refer
to
the
dutch
publicist
of
the
last
century
bynkershoek
whose
work
is
always
quoted
in
the
final
resort
on
these
questions
this
great
writer
expresses
himself
as
follows
it
be
doubted
whether
under
the
name
of
enemies
may
be
understood
also
our
friends
who
having
been
conquered
are
with
the
enemy
their
city
perhaps
being
occupied
by
him
i
should
think
that
they
also
were
to
be
so
understood
certainly
as
regards
goods
which
they
have
under
the
government
of
the
i
know
upon
what
ground
others
say
the
contrary
namely
that
our
friends
although
they
are
with
the
enemy
have
no
spirit
of
hostility
to
us
for
that
it
is
not
of
their
free
will
that
they
are
there
and
that
it
is
only
from
the
that
the
case
is
to
be
judged
but
the
case
does
not
depend
upon
the
alone
because
neither
are
all
the
rest
of
our
subjects
at
any
rate
very
few
of
them
carried
away
by
a
spirit
of
hostility
to
us
but
it
depends
upon
the
right
by
which
those
goods
are
with
the
enemy
and
upon
the
advantage
which
they
afford
him
for
our
nothing
could
be
stronger
in
determining
the
liability
from
domicile
its
sweeping
extent
under
the
exigency
of
war
is
proclaimed
by
this
same
writer
in
words
of
peculiar
weight
it
is
the
condition
of
war
that
enemies
are
despoiled
and
proscribed
as
to
every
right
it
stands
to
reason
that
everything
found
with
the
enemy
changes
its
owner
and
goes
to
the
if
we
follow
the
mere
law
of
war
even
property
may
be
sold
and
its
price
turned
into
the
treasury
as
in
the
case
of
movable
here
is
an
austere
statement
but
it
was
adopted
by
jefferson
as
a
fundamental
principle
in
his
elaborate
letter
to
the
british
minister
vindicating
the
confiscation
of
the
property
of
loyalists
during
the
revolution
it
was
the
of
his
argument
as
it
has
since
been
the
of
judicial
decisions
to
cite
texts
and
precedents
in
its
support
is
superfluous
it
must
be
accepted
as
the
rule
of
international
law
the
rule
as
succinctly
expressed
is
simply
this
that
the
property
of
persons
domiciled
in
an
enemy
country
is
liable
to
seizure
and
capture
without
regard
to
the
alleged
friendly
or
loyal
character
of
the
owner
unquestionably
there
are
limitations
imposed
by
humanity
which
must
not
be
transcended
a
country
must
not
be
wasted
or
buildings
destroyed
unless
under
some
commanding
necessity
this
great
power
must
not
be
wantonly
employed
men
must
not
become
barbarians
but
if
in
the
pursuit
of
the
enemy
or
for
purposes
of
defence
property
must
be
destroyed
then
by
international
law
it
can
be
done
this
is
the
rule
vattel
while
pleading
justly
and
with
persuasive
examples
for
the
preservation
of
works
of
art
such
as
temples
tombs
and
structures
of
remarkable
beauty
admits
that
even
these
may
be
sacrificed
for
the
operations
of
war
to
advance
the
works
in
a
siege
it
is
necessary
to
destroy
edifices
of
this
nature
one
has
undoubtedly
the
right
to
do
so
the
sovereign
of
the
country
or
his
general
destroys
them
indeed
himself
when
the
necessities
or
the
maxims
of
war
invite
thereto
the
governor
of
a
besieged
city
burns
its
suburbs
to
prevent
the
besiegers
from
obtaining
a
lodgment
therein
nobody
thinks
of
blaming
him
who
lays
waste
gardens
vineyards
orchards
in
order
to
pitch
his
tent
and
intrench
himself
this
same
rule
is
recognized
by
manning
in
his
polished
and
humane
work
less
frequently
quoted
but
entitled
always
to
great
respect
this
interesting
writer
expresses
himself
as
follows
is
clearly
a
right
to
destroy
the
property
far
as
necessary
in
making
destruction
of
the
property
is
justifiable
as
far
as
indispensable
for
the
purposes
of
warfare
but
no
with
the
limitations
which
i
have
tried
to
exhibit
the
rule
is
beyond
question
in
the
relations
between
nations
do
you
call
it
harsh
undoubtedly
it
is
so
it
is
war
which
from
beginning
to
end
is
terrible
harshness
without
the
incidents
sanctioned
by
this
rule
war
would
be
changed
so
that
it
would
be
no
longer
war
it
was
such
individual
calamities
that
shakespeare
had
in
mind
when
he
spoke
of
purple
testament
of
bleeding
and
it
was
such
which
entered
into
the
vision
of
that
other
poet
when
in
words
of
remarkable
beauty
he
pictured
by
way
of
contrast
the
blessings
of
peace
forward
goes
the
path
and
straight
the
fearful
path
of
the
direct
it
flies
and
rapid
shattering
that
it
may
reach
and
shattering
what
it
reaches
my
son
the
road
the
human
being
travels
that
on
which
blessing
comes
and
goes
doth
follow
the
course
the
playful
windings
curves
round
the
cornfield
and
the
hill
of
vines
honoring
the
holy
bounds
of
property
and
thus
secure
though
late
leads
to
its
it
only
remains
now
to
show
that
this
rule
of
international
law
is
applicable
to
the
present
case
of
course
our
late
war
was
not
between
two
nations
therefore
it
was
not
strictly
international
but
it
was
between
the
national
government
on
one
side
and
a
rebellion
which
had
become
in
character
with
such
form
and
body
as
to
have
belligerent
rights
on
land
mark
the
distinction
if
you
please
for
i
have
always
insisted
and
still
insist
that
complete
belligerency
on
land
does
not
imply
belligerency
on
the
ocean
as
there
is
a
dominion
of
the
land
so
there
is
a
dominion
of
the
ocean
and
as
there
is
a
belligerency
of
the
land
so
there
is
also
a
belligerency
of
the
ocean
therefore
while
denying
to
our
rebels
belligerent
rights
on
the
ocean
i
have
no
hesitation
with
regard
to
them
on
the
land
but
just
in
proportion
as
these
are
admitted
is
the
rule
of
international
law
made
applicable
to
the
present
case
against
our
rebels
the
nation
had
two
sources
of
power
and
two
arsenals
of
rights
one
of
these
being
the
powers
and
rights
of
sovereignty
and
the
other
the
powers
and
rights
of
war
the
former
being
determined
by
the
constitution
the
latter
by
international
law
the
nation
might
pursue
a
rebel
as
traitor
or
as
belligerent
but
whether
traitor
or
belligerent
he
was
always
an
enemy
pursuing
him
in
the
courts
as
traitor
he
was
justly
entitled
to
all
the
delays
and
safeguards
of
the
constitution
but
it
was
otherwise
if
he
was
treated
as
belligerent
pursuing
him
in
battle
driving
him
from
point
to
point
dislodging
him
from
fortresses
expelling
him
from
towns
pushing
him
back
from
our
advancing
line
and
then
building
fortifications
against
him
all
this
was
war
and
it
was
none
the
less
war
because
the
enemy
was
unhappily
our
own
countryman
a
new
law
supplied
the
rule
for
our
conduct
not
the
constitution
with
its
manifold
provisions
dear
to
the
lover
of
liberty
including
the
solemn
requirement
that
nobody
shall
deprived
of
life
liberty
or
property
without
due
process
of
law
and
then
again
that
other
requirement
that
property
shall
not
be
taken
for
public
use
without
just
all
these
were
silent
while
international
law
prevailed
the
rebellion
had
grown
until
it
became
a
war
and
as
this
war
was
among
countrymen
it
was
a
civil
war
but
the
rule
of
conduct
in
a
civil
war
is
to
be
found
in
the
law
of
nations
i
do
not
stop
to
quote
the
familiar
views
of
publicists
especially
of
vattel
to
the
effect
that
in
a
civil
war
the
two
parties
are
to
be
treated
as
different
suffice
it
to
say
that
such
is
the
judgment
of
all
the
authorities
on
international
law
but
i
come
directly
to
the
decisions
of
our
supreme
court
which
recognize
the
rule
of
international
law
as
applicable
to
our
civil
war
in
the
famous
cases
known
as
the
the
court
expressly
says
persons
residing
within
this
territory
whose
property
may
be
used
to
increase
the
revenues
of
the
hostile
power
are
in
this
contest
liable
to
be
treated
as
enemies
though
not
here
is
the
rule
of
international
law
applied
directly
to
our
civil
war
in
a
later
case
the
rule
is
applied
with
added
emphasis
and
particularity
must
be
governed
by
the
principle
of
public
law
so
often
announced
from
this
bench
as
applicable
alike
to
civil
and
international
wars
that
the
people
of
each
state
or
district
in
insurrection
against
the
united
states
must
be
regarded
as
thus
according
to
our
highest
tribunal
the
rule
in
civil
war
and
international
war
is
the
same
by
another
decision
of
the
court
this
same
rule
continues
in
force
until
the
character
of
public
enemy
is
removed
by
competent
authority
on
this
point
the
court
declares
itself
as
follows
in
the
alexander
cotton
case
the
people
of
each
state
or
district
in
insurrection
against
the
united
states
must
be
regarded
as
enemies
until
by
the
action
of
the
legislature
and
the
executive
or
otherwise
that
relation
is
thoroughly
and
permanently
if
the
present
case
is
to
be
settled
by
authority
this
is
enough
here
is
the
supreme
court
solemnly
recognizing
the
rule
of
international
law
even
to
the
extent
of
embracing
under
its
penalties
the
of
the
hostile
community
without
regard
to
their
sentiments
of
loyalty
this
is
decisive
you
can
not
decree
the
national
liability
in
the
present
case
without
reversing
these
decisions
you
must
declare
that
the
rule
of
international
law
is
not
applicable
to
our
civil
war
there
is
no
ground
for
exception
you
must
reject
the
rule
absolutely
do
you
say
that
its
application
is
harsh
of
course
it
is
but
again
i
say
this
is
war
or
rather
it
is
rebellion
which
has
assumed
the
front
of
war
i
do
not
make
the
rule
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
i
take
it
as
i
find
it
affirmed
by
great
authorities
of
international
law
and
reaffirmed
by
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
here
i
might
stop
for
the
conclusion
stands
on
reason
and
authority
each
unanswerable
but
i
proceed
further
in
order
to
relieve
the
case
of
all
ambiguity
of
course
instances
may
be
adduced
where
compensation
has
been
made
to
sufferers
from
an
army
but
no
case
like
the
present
if
we
glance
at
these
instances
we
shall
see
the
wide
difference
the
first
instance
is
where
property
is
taken
by
the
nation
or
its
representative
its
own
established
of
course
this
is
unlike
that
now
before
us
to
cite
it
is
only
to
perplex
and
mystify
not
to
instruct
thus
a
senator
willey
of
west
virginia
has
adduced
words
from
vattel
on
the
question
subjects
should
be
indemnified
for
damages
sustained
in
war
when
a
field
a
house
or
a
garden
belonging
to
a
private
person
is
taken
for
the
purpose
of
erecting
on
the
spot
a
or
any
other
piece
of
but
this
authority
is
not
applicable
to
the
present
case
where
the
claimant
is
not
what
vattel
calls
a
and
the
property
was
not
within
the
established
jurisdiction
of
the
nation
it
applies
only
to
such
cases
as
occurred
during
the
war
of
where
property
was
taken
on
the
canadian
frontier
or
at
new
orleans
for
the
erection
of
a
fortress
or
such
a
case
as
that
which
formed
one
of
the
military
glories
of
the
count
rochambeau
when
at
the
head
of
the
french
forces
in
our
country
the
story
is
little
known
and
therefore
i
adduce
it
now
as
i
find
it
in
the
memoirs
of
ségur
one
of
the
brilliant
officers
who
accompanied
the
expedition
the
french
squadrons
were
quitting
their
camp
at
crompond
near
the
north
river
in
new
york
on
their
way
to
embark
for
france
their
commander
fresh
from
the
victory
of
yorktown
was
at
the
head
of
the
columns
when
a
simple
citizen
approached
and
tapping
him
slightly
on
the
shoulder
said
the
name
of
the
law
you
are
my
the
glittering
staff
by
which
count
rochambeau
was
surrounded
broke
forth
with
indignation
but
the
restrained
their
impatience
and
smiling
said
to
the
american
citizen
me
away
with
you
if
you
replied
the
simple
representative
of
the
law
have
done
my
duty
and
your
excellency
may
proceed
on
your
march
if
you
wish
to
set
justice
at
defiance
some
of
your
soldiers
have
cut
down
several
trees
and
burnt
them
to
make
their
fires
the
owner
of
them
claims
an
indemnity
and
has
obtained
a
warrant
against
you
which
i
have
come
to
the
count
on
hearing
this
explanation
which
was
translated
by
one
of
his
staff
gave
bail
and
at
once
directed
the
settlement
of
the
claim
on
equitable
grounds
the
american
withdrew
and
the
french
squadrons
which
had
been
arrested
by
a
simple
constable
proceeded
on
their
march
this
interesting
story
so
honorable
to
our
country
and
to
the
french
commander
is
disfigured
by
the
end
showing
extortion
on
the
part
of
the
claimant
a
judgment
by
arbitration
fixed
the
damages
at
four
hundred
dollars
being
less
than
the
commander
had
at
once
offered
while
the
claimant
demanded
no
less
than
three
thousand
dollars
afterward
in
the
national
assembly
of
france
when
that
great
country
began
to
throb
with
republican
life
this
instance
of
submission
to
law
was
mentioned
with
pride
but
though
it
can
not
lose
its
place
in
history
it
can
not
furnish
a
precedent
of
international
law
besides
being
without
any
exigency
of
defence
the
trespass
was
within
our
own
jurisdiction
in
which
respect
it
differed
precisely
from
the
case
on
which
we
are
to
vote
i
adduce
it
now
because
it
serves
to
illustrate
vividly
the
line
of
law
another
instance
which
i
mention
in
order
to
put
it
aside
is
an
army
in
a
hostile
country
has
carefully
paid
for
all
its
such
conduct
is
exceptional
the
general
rule
was
expressed
by
marcy
during
our
war
with
mexico
when
he
said
that
invading
army
has
the
unquestionable
right
to
draw
its
supplies
from
the
enemy
without
paying
for
them
and
to
require
contributions
for
its
support
that
enemy
may
be
made
to
feel
the
weight
of
the
but
general
halleck
after
quoting
these
words
says
that
resort
to
forced
contributions
for
the
support
of
our
armies
in
a
country
like
mexico
under
the
particular
circumstances
of
the
war
would
have
been
at
least
impolitic
if
not
unjust
and
the
american
generals
very
properly
declined
to
adopt
except
to
a
very
limited
extent
the
mode
according
to
this
learned
authority
it
was
a
question
of
policy
rather
than
of
law
the
most
remarkable
instance
of
forbearance
under
this
head
was
that
of
the
duke
of
wellington
as
he
entered
france
with
his
victorious
troops
fresh
from
the
fields
of
spain
he
was
peremptory
that
nothing
should
be
taken
without
compensation
his
order
on
this
occasion
will
be
found
at
length
in
colonel
collection
of
his
his
habit
was
to
give
receipts
for
supplies
and
ready
money
was
paid
in
the
camp
the
british
historian
dwells
with
pride
on
the
conduct
of
the
commander
and
records
the
astonishment
with
which
it
was
regarded
by
both
soldiers
and
peasantry
who
found
it
so
utterly
at
variance
with
the
system
by
which
the
spaniards
had
suffered
and
the
french
had
profited
during
the
peninsular
campaigns
the
conduct
of
the
duke
of
wellington
can
not
be
too
highly
prized
it
was
more
than
a
victory
i
have
always
regarded
it
as
the
of
civilized
war
so
far
as
war
can
be
civilized
but
i
am
obliged
to
add
on
this
occasion
that
it
was
politic
also
in
thus
softening
the
rigors
of
war
he
smoothed
the
way
for
his
conquering
army
in
a
dispatch
to
one
of
his
generals
written
in
the
spirit
of
the
order
he
says
in
very
expressive
language
we
were
five
times
stronger
than
we
are
we
could
not
venture
to
enter
france
if
we
can
not
prevent
our
soldiers
from
it
was
in
a
refined
policy
that
this
important
order
had
its
origin
regarding
it
as
a
generous
example
for
other
commanders
and
offering
to
it
my
homage
i
must
confess
that
as
a
precedent
it
is
entirely
inapplicable
to
the
present
case
putting
aside
these
two
several
classes
of
cases
we
are
brought
back
to
the
original
principle
that
there
can
be
no
legal
claim
to
damages
for
property
situated
in
an
enemy
country
and
belonging
to
a
person
domiciled
there
when
taken
for
the
exigencies
of
war
if
the
conclusion
were
doubtful
i
should
deem
it
my
duty
to
exhibit
at
length
the
costly
consequences
from
an
allowance
of
this
claim
the
small
sum
which
you
vote
will
be
a
precedent
for
millions
if
you
pay
miss
sue
murphey
you
must
pay
claimants
whose
name
will
be
legion
of
course
if
justice
requires
let
it
be
done
even
though
the
treasury
fail
but
the
mere
possibility
of
such
liabilities
is
a
reason
for
caution
on
our
part
we
must
consider
the
present
case
as
if
on
its
face
it
involved
not
merely
a
few
thousands
but
many
millions
pay
it
and
the
country
will
not
be
bankrupt
but
it
will
have
an
infinite
draft
upon
its
resources
if
the
occasion
were
not
too
grave
for
a
jest
i
would
say
of
it
as
mercutio
said
of
his
wound
not
so
deep
as
a
well
nor
so
wide
as
a
but
if
you
would
have
a
practical
idea
of
the
extent
of
these
claims
be
taught
by
the
history
of
the
british
loyalists
who
at
the
close
of
our
revolution
appealed
to
parliament
for
compensation
on
account
of
their
losses
the
whole
number
of
these
claims
was
five
thousand
and
the
whole
amount
claimed
was
or
about
million
dollars
of
which
the
commissioners
allowed
less
than
half
our
claimants
would
be
much
more
numerous
and
the
amount
claimed
vaster
we
may
also
learn
from
england
something
of
the
spirit
in
which
such
claimants
should
be
treated
even
while
providing
for
them
parliament
refused
to
recognize
any
legal
title
on
their
part
what
it
did
was
in
compassion
generosity
and
bounty
not
in
satisfaction
of
a
debt
pitt
in
presenting
the
plan
which
was
adopted
expressly
denied
any
right
on
grounds
of
here
are
his
words
american
loyalists
in
his
opinion
could
not
call
upon
the
house
to
make
compensation
for
their
losses
as
a
matter
of
strict
justice
but
they
most
undoubtedly
had
strong
claims
on
their
generosity
and
compassion
in
the
mode
therefore
that
he
should
propose
for
finally
adjusting
their
claims
he
had
laid
down
a
principle
with
a
view
to
mark
this
in
the
same
spirit
burke
said
a
mode
of
compensating
the
claims
of
the
loyalists
would
do
the
country
the
highest
credit
it
was
a
new
and
a
noble
instance
of
national
bounty
and
fox
who
was
full
of
ardent
sympathies
declared
were
entitled
to
a
compensation
by
no
means
to
a
full
and
pitt
at
another
stage
of
the
debate
thus
denied
their
claim
certainly
had
sort
of
to
a
repayment
of
all
they
had
so
far
as
this
instance
is
an
example
to
us
it
is
only
an
incentive
to
a
kindly
policy
which
after
prudent
inquiry
and
full
knowledge
of
the
extent
of
these
claims
shall
make
such
reasonable
allowance
as
humanity
and
patriotism
may
require
there
must
be
an
inquiry
not
only
into
this
individual
case
but
into
all
possible
cases
that
may
spring
into
being
so
that
when
we
act
it
may
be
on
the
whole
subject
from
the
beginning
of
our
national
life
congress
has
been
called
to
deal
with
claims
for
losses
by
war
though
new
in
form
the
present
case
belongs
to
a
long
list
whose
beginning
is
hidden
in
revolutionary
history
the
folio
volume
of
state
papers
now
before
me
entitled
attests
the
number
and
variety
even
amid
the
struggles
of
the
war
as
early
as
the
rev
witherspoon
was
allowed
for
repairs
of
the
college
at
princeton
damaged
by
the
troops
there
was
afterward
a
similar
allowance
to
the
academy
at
wilmington
in
delaware
and
also
to
the
college
in
rhode
island
these
latter
were
recommended
by
hamilton
while
secretary
of
the
treasury
as
the
interests
of
on
this
account
they
were
treated
as
exceptional
it
will
also
be
observed
that
they
concerned
claimants
within
our
own
jurisdiction
but
on
a
claim
for
compensation
for
a
house
burnt
at
charlestown
for
the
purpose
of
dislodging
the
enemy
by
order
of
the
american
commander
at
that
point
during
the
siege
of
boston
a
committee
of
congress
in
reported
that
government
has
not
adopted
a
general
rule
to
compensate
individuals
who
have
suffered
in
a
similar
manner
the
committee
are
of
opinion
that
the
prayer
of
this
petition
can
not
be
at
a
later
day
however
after
successive
favorable
reports
the
claim
was
finally
in
allowed
and
compensation
made
to
the
extent
of
the
estimated
value
of
the
property
destroyed
in
a
claimant
received
compensation
for
a
house
at
the
end
of
the
potomac
bridge
which
was
blown
up
to
prevent
certain
public
stores
from
falling
into
the
hands
of
the
enemy
and
other
claimants
at
baltimore
received
compensation
for
burnt
in
the
defence
of
the
city
the
report
of
a
committee
in
another
case
says
that
the
course
of
congress
to
inculcate
that
indemnity
is
due
to
all
those
losses
have
arisen
from
the
acts
of
our
own
government
or
those
acting
under
its
while
losses
produced
by
the
conduct
of
the
enemy
are
to
be
classed
among
the
unavoidable
calamities
of
this
is
the
most
complete
statement
of
the
rule
which
i
find
after
the
battle
of
new
orleans
the
question
of
the
application
of
this
rule
was
presented
repeatedly
and
with
various
results
in
one
case
a
claim
for
quantity
of
used
as
fuel
by
troops
of
general
jackson
was
paid
by
congress
so
also
was
a
claim
for
damages
to
a
plantation
which
public
works
for
the
defence
of
the
country
were
on
the
other
hand
a
claim
for
elegant
and
which
afforded
shelter
to
the
british
army
and
was
therefore
fired
on
with
hot
shot
also
a
claim
for
damage
to
a
house
and
plantation
where
a
battery
was
erected
by
our
troops
and
on
both
of
which
claims
the
committee
simultaneously
with
the
two
former
reported
favorably
were
disallowed
by
congress
in
a
subsequent
case
both
the
report
and
action
seem
to
have
proceeded
on
a
different
principle
from
that
previously
enunciated
at
the
landing
of
the
enemy
near
new
orleans
the
levee
was
cut
in
order
to
annoy
him
as
a
consequence
the
plantation
of
the
claimant
was
inundated
and
suffered
damages
estimated
at
but
the
claim
was
rejected
on
the
ground
that
injury
was
done
in
the
necessary
operations
of
certainly
this
ground
may
be
adopted
in
the
present
case
while
it
must
not
be
forgotten
that
in
all
the
foregoing
cases
the
claimants
were
citizens
within
our
own
jurisdiction
whose
property
had
been
used
against
a
foreign
enemy
the
multiplicity
of
claims
arising
in
the
war
of
prompted
an
act
of
congress
in
for
payment
for
property
lost
captured
or
destroyed
by
the
in
this
act
it
was
among
other
things
provided
any
person
who
in
the
time
aforesaid
the
late
war
has
sustained
damage
by
the
destruction
of
his
or
her
house
or
building
by
the
enemy
while
the
same
was
occupied
as
a
military
deposit
under
the
authority
of
an
officer
or
agent
of
the
united
states
shall
be
allowed
and
paid
the
amount
of
such
damage
provided
it
shall
appear
that
such
occupation
was
the
cause
of
its
two
years
later
it
was
found
that
in
order
to
obtain
the
benefits
of
this
act
people
especially
on
the
frontier
of
the
state
of
new
york
had
not
hesitated
at
forgery
and
perhaps
thereupon
the
law
which
by
its
terms
was
limited
to
two
years
and
which
it
had
been
proposed
to
extend
was
permitted
to
expire
and
it
is
accordingly
now
marked
in
our
statutes
but
it
is
not
without
its
lesson
it
shows
what
may
be
expected
should
any
precedent
be
adopted
by
congress
to
quicken
the
claimants
now
dormant
in
the
south
is
the
duty
of
a
good
government
to
attend
to
the
morals
of
the
people
as
an
affair
of
primary
so
said
the
committee
in
recommending
the
of
the
act
but
this
warning
is
as
applicable
now
as
then
among
the
claimants
of
the
present
day
there
are
doubtless
many
of
character
and
virtue
it
is
hard
to
vote
against
them
but
i
can
not
be
controlled
on
this
occasion
by
my
sympathies
everywhere
and
in
every
household
there
has
been
suffering
which
mortal
power
can
not
measure
sometimes
it
is
borne
in
silence
and
solitude
sometimes
it
is
manifest
to
all
in
coming
into
this
chamber
and
asking
for
compensation
it
invites
comparison
with
other
instances
if
your
allowance
is
to
be
on
account
of
merit
who
will
venture
to
say
that
this
case
is
the
most
worthy
it
is
before
us
now
for
judgment
but
there
are
others
not
now
before
us
where
the
suffering
has
been
greater
and
where
i
do
not
hesitate
to
say
the
reward
should
be
in
proportion
this
is
an
appeal
for
justice
therefore
do
i
say
in
the
name
of
justice
wait
january
the
same
bill
being
under
discussion
sumner
spoke
as
follows
there
is
another
point
on
which
i
forbore
to
dwell
with
sufficient
particularity
when
i
spoke
before
it
is
this
assuming
that
this
claimant
is
loyal
i
honor
her
that
she
kept
her
loyalty
under
the
surrounding
pressure
of
rebellion
of
course
this
was
her
duty
nor
more
nor
less
the
practical
question
is
shall
she
be
paid
for
it
had
she
been
disloyal
there
would
have
been
no
proposition
of
compensation
as
the
liability
of
the
nation
is
urged
on
the
single
ground
that
she
kept
her
regard
for
the
flag
truly
and
sincerely
it
is
evident
that
this
loyalty
must
be
put
beyond
question
it
must
be
established
like
any
other
essential
link
of
evidence
i
think
i
do
not
err
in
supposing
that
it
is
not
established
in
the
present
case
at
least
with
such
certainty
as
to
justify
opening
the
doors
of
the
treasury
but
assuming
that
in
fact
the
loyalty
is
established
i
desire
to
go
further
and
say
that
not
only
is
the
present
claim
without
any
support
in
law
but
it
is
unreasonable
the
rebel
states
had
become
one
immense
of
loyalty
alabama
was
a
the
nation
at
every
cost
of
treasure
and
blood
broke
into
that
and
succeeded
in
rescuing
the
loyalists
but
the
terrible
effort
which
cost
the
nation
so
dearly
involved
the
loyalists
in
losses
also
in
breaking
into
the
and
dislodging
the
rebel
keepers
property
of
loyalists
suffered
and
now
we
are
asked
to
pay
for
this
property
damaged
in
our
efforts
for
their
redemption
our
troops
came
down
to
break
the
and
set
the
captives
free
is
it
not
unreasonable
to
expect
us
to
pay
for
this
breaking
if
the
forces
of
the
united
states
had
failed
then
would
these
loyalists
have
lost
everything
country
property
and
all
that
is
if
really
loyal
according
to
present
professions
it
was
our
national
forces
that
saved
them
from
this
sacrifice
securing
to
them
country
and
if
not
all
their
property
much
of
it
a
part
of
the
property
of
the
present
claimant
was
taken
in
order
to
save
to
her
all
else
including
country
itself
it
was
a
case
such
as
might
occur
under
other
circumstances
where
a
part
and
a
very
small
part
is
sacrificed
in
order
to
save
the
rest
according
to
all
analogies
of
jurisprudence
and
the
principles
of
justice
itself
the
claimant
can
look
for
nothing
beyond
such
contribution
as
congress
in
its
bounty
may
appropriate
it
is
a
case
of
bounty
and
not
of
law
it
is
a
mistake
to
suppose
as
has
been
most
earnestly
argued
that
a
claimant
of
approved
loyalty
in
the
rebel
states
should
have
compensation
precisely
like
a
similar
claimant
in
a
loyal
state
to
my
mind
this
assumption
is
founded
on
a
misapprehension
of
the
constitution
the
law
and
the
reason
of
the
case
three
different
misapprehensions
by
the
constitution
property
can
not
be
taken
for
public
use
without
but
this
rule
was
silent
in
the
rebel
states
international
law
stepped
in
and
supplied
a
different
rule
and
when
we
consider
how
much
was
saved
to
the
loyal
citizen
in
a
rebel
state
by
the
national
arms
it
will
be
found
that
this
rule
is
only
according
to
justice
i
have
no
disposition
to
shut
the
door
upon
claimants
let
them
be
heard
but
the
hearing
must
be
according
to
some
system
so
that
congress
shall
know
the
character
and
extent
of
these
claims
before
the
motion
of
my
colleague
i
had
already
prepared
instructions
for
the
committee
which
i
will
read
as
expressing
my
own
conclusion
on
this
matter
the
committee
to
whom
this
bill
shall
be
referred
the
committee
on
claims
be
instructed
to
consider
the
expediency
of
providing
for
the
appointment
of
a
commission
whose
duty
it
shall
be
to
inquire
into
the
claims
of
the
loyal
citizens
of
the
national
government
arising
during
the
recent
rebellion
anywhere
in
the
united
states
classifying
these
claims
specifying
their
respective
amounts
and
the
circumstances
out
of
which
they
originated
also
the
evidence
of
loyalty
adduced
by
the
claimants
respectively
to
the
end
that
congress
may
know
precisely
the
extent
and
character
of
these
claims
before
legislating
as
this
is
a
resolution
of
instruction
simply
to
consider
the
expediency
of
what
is
proposed
i
presume
there
can
be
no
objection
to
it
afterwards
on
motion
of
sumner
the
bill
with
all
pending
propositions
was
recommitted
to
the
committee
on
claims
tribute
to
hon
james
hinds
representative
of
arkansas
speech
in
the
senate
january
hinds
while
engaged
in
canvassing
the
state
of
arkansas
on
the
republican
side
was
assassinated
the
senators
of
arkansas
requested
sumner
to
speak
on
the
resolution
announcing
his
death
president
it
is
with
hesitation
that
i
add
a
word
on
this
melancholy
occasion
and
i
do
it
only
in
compliance
with
the
suggestion
of
others
i
did
not
know
hinds
personally
but
i
have
been
interested
in
his
life
and
touched
by
his
tragical
end
born
in
new
york
educated
in
ohio
a
settler
in
minnesota
and
then
a
citizen
of
arkansas
he
carried
with
him
always
the
energies
and
principles
ripened
under
our
northern
skies
he
became
a
representative
in
congress
and
better
still
a
vindicator
of
the
rights
of
man
unhappily
that
barbarism
which
we
call
slavery
is
not
yet
dead
and
it
was
his
fate
to
fall
under
its
vindictive
assault
pleading
for
the
equal
rights
of
all
he
became
a
victim
and
martyr
thus
suddenly
arrested
in
life
his
death
is
a
special
sorrow
not
only
to
family
and
friends
but
to
the
country
which
he
had
begun
to
serve
so
well
the
void
when
a
young
man
dies
is
measured
less
by
what
he
has
done
than
by
the
promises
of
the
future
performance
itself
is
forgotten
in
the
ample
assurance
afforded
by
character
already
hinds
had
given
himself
sincerely
and
bravely
to
the
good
cause
by
presence
and
speech
he
was
urging
those
great
principles
of
the
declaration
of
independence
whose
complete
recognition
will
be
the
of
our
republic
when
he
fell
by
the
stealthy
shot
of
an
assassin
it
was
in
the
midst
of
this
work
that
he
fell
and
on
this
account
i
am
glad
to
offer
my
tribute
to
his
memory
as
the
life
he
led
was
not
without
honor
so
his
death
is
not
without
consolation
it
was
the
saying
of
antiquity
that
it
is
sweet
to
die
for
country
here
was
death
not
only
for
country
but
for
mankind
nor
is
it
to
be
forgotten
that
dying
in
such
a
cause
his
living
voice
is
echoed
from
the
tomb
there
is
a
testimony
in
death
often
greater
than
in
any
life
the
cause
for
which
a
man
dies
lives
anew
in
his
death
the
assassination
could
trammel
up
the
consequence
then
might
the
assassin
find
some
other
satisfaction
than
the
gratification
of
a
barbarous
nature
but
this
can
not
be
his
own
soul
is
blasted
the
cause
he
sought
to
kill
is
elevated
and
thus
it
is
now
the
assassin
is
a
fugitive
in
some
unknown
retreat
the
cause
is
about
to
triumph
often
it
happens
that
death
which
takes
away
life
confers
what
life
alone
can
not
give
it
makes
famous
history
does
not
forget
lovejoy
who
for
devotion
to
the
cause
of
the
slave
was
murdered
by
a
fanatical
mob
and
it
has
already
enshrined
abraham
lincoln
in
holiest
keeping
another
is
added
to
the
roll
less
exalted
than
lincoln
less
early
in
immolation
than
lovejoy
but
like
these
two
to
be
remembered
always
among
those
who
passed
out
of
life
through
the
gate
of
sacrifice
powers
of
congress
to
prohibit
inequality
caste
and
oligarchy

we

the
machine
we

has
for
its
object
the
conservation
of
equal

surely
if
we
are
wise
we
shall
seek
the
simplest
process
producing
the
desired
result
with
the
greatest
economy
of
time
and
force
how
widely
senators
are
departing
from
this
rule
will
appear
before
i
have
done
rarely
have
i
entered
upon
any
debate
in
this
chamber
with
a
sense
of
sadness
so
heavy
as
oppresses
me
at
this
moment
it
was
sad
enough
to
meet
the
champions
of
slavery
as
in
other
days
they
openly
vindicated
the
monstrous
pretension
and
claimed
for
it
the
safeguard
of
the
constitution
insisting
that
slavery
was
national
and
freedom
sectional
but
this
was
not
so
sad
as
now
after
a
bloody
war
with
slavery
and
its
defeat
on
the
to
meet
the
champions
of
a
kindred
pretension
for
which
they
claim
the
safeguard
of
the
constitution
insisting
also
as
in
the
case
of
slavery
upon
state
rights
the
familiar
vindication
of
slavery
in
those
early
debates
was
less
sickening
than
the
vindication
now
of
the
intolerable
pretension
that
a
state
constituting
part
of
the
nation
and
calling
itself
is
entitled
to
shut
out
any
citizen
from
participation
in
government
simply
on
account
of
race
or
color
to
denominate
such
pretension
as
intolerable
expresses
very
inadequately
the
extent
of
its
absurdity
and
the
utterness
of
its
repugnance
to
all
good
principles
whether
of
reason
morals
or
government
i
make
no
question
with
individual
senators
i
make
no
personal
allusion
but
i
meet
the
odious
imposture
as
i
met
the
earlier
imposture
with
indignation
and
contempt
naturally
excited
by
anything
unworthy
of
this
chamber
and
unworthy
of
the
republic
how
it
can
enter
here
and
find
senators
willing
to
assume
the
stigma
of
its
championship
is
more
than
i
can
comprehend
nobody
ever
vindicated
slavery
who
did
not
lay
up
a
store
of
regret
for
himself
and
his
children
and
permit
me
to
say
now
nobody
can
vindicate
inequality
and
caste
whether
civil
or
political
the
direct
offspring
of
slavery
as
intrenched
in
the
constitution
beyond
the
reach
of
national
prohibition
without
laying
up
a
similar
store
of
regret
death
may
happily
come
to
remove
the
champion
from
the
judgment
of
the
world
but
history
will
make
its
faithful
record
to
be
read
with
sorrow
hereafter
do
not
complain
if
i
speak
strongly
the
occasion
requires
it
i
seek
to
save
the
senate
from
participation
in
an
irrational
and
degrading
pretension
others
may
be
cool
and
indifferent
but
i
have
warred
with
slavery
too
long
in
all
its
different
forms
not
to
be
aroused
when
this
old
enemy
shows
its
head
under
an
once
it
was
slavery
now
it
is
caste
and
the
same
excuse
is
assigned
now
as
then
in
the
name
of
state
rights
slavery
with
all
its
brood
of
wrong
was
upheld
and
now
in
the
name
of
state
rights
caste
fruitful
also
in
wrong
is
upheld
the
old
champions
reappear
under
other
names
and
from
other
states
each
crying
out
that
under
the
national
constitution
notwithstanding
even
its
supplementary
amendments
a
state
may
if
it
pleases
deny
political
rights
on
account
of
race
or
color
and
thus
establish
that
vilest
institution
a
caste
and
an
oligarchy
of
the
skin
this
perversity
which
to
careless
observation
seems
so
incomprehensible
is
easily
understood
when
it
is
considered
that
the
present
generation
grew
up
under
an
interpretation
of
the
national
constitution
supplied
by
the
upholders
of
slavery
state
rights
were
exalted
and
the
nation
was
humbled
because
in
this
way
slavery
might
be
protected
anything
for
slavery
was
constitutional
such
was
the
lesson
we
were
taught
how
often
i
have
heard
it
how
often
it
has
sounded
through
this
chamber
and
been
proclaimed
in
speech
and
law
under
its
influence
the
right
of
petition
was
denied
the
atrocious
fugitive
slave
bill
was
enacted
and
the
claim
was
advanced
that
slavery
travelled
with
the
flag
of
the
republic
vain
are
all
our
victories
if
this
terrible
rule
is
not
reversed
so
that
state
rights
shall
yield
to
human
rights
and
the
nation
be
exalted
as
the
bulwark
of
all
this
will
be
the
crowning
victory
of
the
war
beyond
all
question
the
true
rule
under
the
national
constitution
especially
since
its
additional
amendments
is
that
for
human
rights
is
yes
sir
against
the
old
rule
for
i
put
the
new
rule
for
human
sir
i
do
not
declare
this
rule
hastily
and
i
know
the
presence
in
which
i
speak
i
am
surrounded
by
lawyers
and
now
i
challenge
any
one
or
all
to
this
debate
i
invoke
the
discussion
on
an
occasion
less
important
pitt
afterwards
lord
chatham
after
saying
that
he
came
not
the
doubled
down
in
to
defend
the
cause
of
liberty
that
he
relied
on
general
principle
a
constitutional
principle
exclaimed
is
a
ground
on
which
i
stand
firm
on
which
i
dare
meet
any
in
the
same
spirit
i
would
speak
now
no
learning
in
books
no
skill
acquired
in
courts
no
sharpness
of
forensic
dialectics
no
cunning
in
splitting
hairs
can
impair
the
vigor
of
the
constitutional
principle
which
i
announce
whatever
you
enact
for
human
rights
is
constitutional
there
can
be
no
state
rights
against
human
rights
and
this
is
the
supreme
law
of
the
land
anything
in
the
constitution
or
laws
of
any
state
to
the
contrary
notwithstanding
a
state
exercises
its
proper
function
when
within
its
own
jurisdiction
it
administers
local
law
watches
local
interests
promotes
local
charities
and
by
local
knowledge
brings
the
guardianship
of
government
to
the
home
of
the
citizen
such
is
the
proper
function
of
the
state
by
which
we
are
saved
from
that
centralization
elsewhere
so
absorbing
but
a
state
transcends
its
proper
function
when
it
interferes
with
those
equal
rights
whether
civil
or
political
which
by
the
declaration
of
independence
and
repeated
texts
of
the
national
constitution
are
under
the
safeguard
of
the
nation
the
state
is
local
in
character
and
not
universal
whatever
is
justly
local
belongs
to
its
cognizance
whatever
is
universal
belongs
to
the
nation
but
what
can
be
more
universal
than
the
rights
of
man
they
are
for
men
not
for
all
white
men
but
for
all
men
such
they
have
been
declared
by
our
fathers
and
this
axiom
of
liberty
nobody
can
dispute
listening
to
the
champions
of
caste
and
oligarchy
under
the
national
constitution
and
perusing
their
writings
i
think
i
understand
the
position
they
take
with
as
much
calmness
as
i
can
command
i
note
what
they
have
to
say
in
speech
and
in
print
i
know
it
all
i
do
not
err
when
i
say
that
this
whole
terrible
and
ignominious
pretension
is
traced
to
direct
and
barefaced
perversion
of
the
national
constitution
search
history
study
constitutions
examine
laws
and
you
will
find
no
perversion
more
thoroughly
revolting
by
the
national
constitution
it
is
provided
that
electors
in
each
state
shall
have
the
requisite
for
electors
of
the
most
numerous
branch
of
the
state
legislature
thus
seeming
to
refer
the
primary
determination
of
what
are
called
to
the
states
and
this
is
reinforced
by
the
further
provision
that
times
places
and
manner
of
holding
elections
for
senators
and
representatives
shall
be
prescribed
in
each
state
by
the
legislature
thereof
but
the
congress
may
at
any
time
by
law
make
or
alter
such
this
is
all
on
these
simple
texts
conferring
plain
and
intelligible
powers
the
champions
insist
that
may
be
made
a
and
that
under
the
guise
of
citizens
whose
only
offence
is
a
skin
not
colored
like
our
own
may
be
shut
out
from
political
rights
and
that
in
this
way
a
monopoly
of
rights
being
at
once
a
caste
and
an
oligarchy
of
the
skin
is
placed
under
the
safeguard
of
the
national
constitution
such
is
the
case
of
the
champions
this
is
their
with
all
their
learning
all
their
subtlety
all
their
sharpness
this
is
what
they
have
to
say
in
behalf
of
an
infamous
pretension
under
the
national
constitution
everything
from
them
begins
and
ends
in
a
perversion
of
two
words
and
now
to
this
perversion
i
oppose
denial
these
two
words
are
not
justly
susceptible
of
any
such
signification
especially
in
a
national
constitution
which
is
to
be
interpreted
always
so
that
human
rights
shall
not
suffer
i
do
not
stop
now
for
dictionaries
the
case
is
too
plain
a
is
something
that
can
be
acquired
a
man
is
familiarly
said
to
for
an
office
nothing
can
be
a
which
is
not
in
its
nature
attainable
as
residence
property
education
or
character
each
of
which
is
within
the
possible
reach
of
effort
color
can
not
be
a
if
the
prescribed
were
color
of
the
hair
or
color
of
the
eyes
all
would
see
its
absurdity
but
it
is
none
the
less
absurd
when
it
is
color
of
the
skin
here
is
an
unchangeable
condition
impressed
by
providence
are
we
not
reminded
that
the
leopard
can
not
change
his
spots
or
the
ethiopian
his
skin
these
are
two
examples
of
enduring
conditions
color
is
a
quality
from
nature
but
a
is
very
different
from
a
a
quality
inherent
in
man
and
part
of
himself
can
never
be
a
in
the
sense
of
the
national
constitution
on
other
occasions
i
have
cited
authorities
and
shown
how
this
attempt
to
foist
into
the
national
constitution
a
pernicious
meaning
is
in
defiance
of
all
approved
definition
as
it
is
plainly
repugnant
to
reason
justice
and
common
sense
the
same
judgment
must
be
pronounced
on
the
attempt
to
found
this
outrage
upon
the
power
to
make
as
if
this
word
had
not
a
limited
signification
which
renders
such
a
pretension
impossible
are
nothing
but
rules
applicable
to
a
given
matter
they
concern
the
manner
in
which
a
business
shall
be
conducted
and
when
used
with
regard
to
elections
are
applicable
to
what
may
be
called
incidents
in
contradistinction
to
the
principal
which
is
nothing
less
than
the
right
to
vote
a
power
to
regulate
is
not
a
power
to
destroy
or
to
disfranchise
in
an
evil
hour
human
rights
may
be
struck
down
but
it
can
not
be
merely
by
the
pretension
that
under
such
authority
this
great
wrong
may
be
done
is
another
illustration
of
that
extravagance
which
the
champions
do
not
shrink
from
avowing
the
whole
structure
of
caste
and
oligarchy
as
founded
on
two
words
may
be
dismissed
it
is
hard
even
to
think
of
it
without
impatience
to
speak
of
it
without
denouncing
it
as
unworthy
of
human
head
or
human
heart
there
are
honorable
senators
who
shrink
from
any
direct
argument
on
these
two
words
and
wrapping
themselves
in
pleonastic
phrase
content
themselves
with
the
general
assertion
that
power
over
suffrage
belongs
to
the
states
but
they
can
not
maintain
this
conclusion
without
founding
on
these
two
words
insisting
that
color
may
be
a
and
that
under
the
narrow
power
to
make
a
race
may
be
broadly
disfranchised
to
this
wretched
pretension
are
they
driven
and
now
if
there
be
any
such
within
the
sound
of
my
voice
i
ask
the
question
directly
can
whether
of
hair
eyes
or
skin
be
a
under
our
national
constitution
under
the
pretence
of
making
of
elections
can
a
race
be
disfranchised
with
all
the
power
derived
from
both
these
words
can
any
state
undertake
to
establish
a
caste
and
organize
an
oligarchy
of
the
skin
to
put
these
questions
is
to
answer
them
such
is
the
case
as
presented
by
the
champions
but
looking
at
the
national
constitution
we
shall
be
astonished
still
more
at
this
pretension
on
other
occasions
i
have
gone
over
the
whole
case
of
human
rights
state
rights
under
the
national
constitution
for
the
present
i
content
myself
with
allusions
only
to
the
principal
points
it
is
under
the
national
constitution
that
the
champions
set
up
their
pretension
therefore
to
the
national
constitution
i
go
and
i
begin
by
appealing
to
the
letter
which
from
beginning
to
end
does
not
contain
one
word
recognizing
its
letter
is
blameless
and
its
spirit
is
not
less
so
surely
a
power
to
disfranchise
for
color
must
find
some
sanction
in
the
constitution
there
must
be
some
word
of
clear
intent
under
which
this
terrible
prerogative
can
be
exercised
this
conclusion
of
reason
is
reinforced
by
the
positive
text
of
our
magna
charta
the
declaration
of
independence
where
it
is
expressly
announced
that
all
men
are
equal
in
rights
and
that
just
government
stands
only
on
the
consent
of
the
governed
in
the
face
of
the
national
constitution
interpreted
first
by
itself
and
then
by
the
declaration
of
independence
how
can
this
pretension
prevail
but
there
are
positive
texts
of
the
national
constitution
refulgent
as
the
capitol
itself
which
forbid
it
with
sovereign
irresistible
power
and
invest
congress
with
all
needful
authority
to
maintain
the
prohibition
there
is
that
clause
by
which
it
is
expressly
declared
that
united
states
shall
guaranty
to
every
state
in
this
union
a
republican
form
of
and
congress
is
empowered
to
enforce
this
guaranty
the
definition
of
a
republican
government
was
solemnly
announced
by
our
fathers
first
in
that
great
which
preceded
the
revolution
without
representation
is
tyranny
and
secondly
in
the
great
declaration
at
the
birth
of
the
republic
that
all
men
are
equal
in
rights
and
that
just
government
stands
only
on
the
consent
of
the
governed
a
republic
is
where
taxation
and
representation
go
hand
in
hand
where
all
are
equal
in
rights
and
no
man
is
excluded
from
participation
in
the
government
such
is
the
definition
of
a
republican
government
which
it
is
the
duty
of
congress
to
maintain
here
is
a
bountiful
source
of
power
which
can
not
be
called
in
question
in
the
execution
of
the
guaranty
congress
may
nay
must
require
that
there
shall
be
no
inequality
caste
or
oligarchy
of
the
skin
i
know
well
the
arguments
of
the
champions
they
insist
that
the
definition
of
a
republican
government
is
to
be
found
in
the
state
constitutions
at
the
adoption
of
the
national
constitution
and
as
all
these
except
massachusetts
recognized
slavery
they
find
that
the
denial
of
human
rights
is
republican
but
the
champions
forget
that
slavery
was
regarded
as
a
temporary
exception
that
the
slave
who
was
not
represented
was
not
taxed
that
he
was
not
part
of
the
that
the
difference
at
that
time
was
not
between
white
and
black
but
between
slave
and
freeman
precisely
as
in
the
days
of
magna
charta
that
in
most
of
the
states
all
freemen
without
distinction
of
color
were
citizens
and
that
according
to
the
history
of
the
times
there
was
no
state
which
ventured
to
announce
in
its
constitution
a
discrimination
founded
on
color
except
virginia
georgia
and
south
carolina
this
last
the
persevering
enemy
of
republican
government
for
successive
generations
so
that
if
we
look
at
the
state
constitutions
we
find
that
they
also
testify
to
the
true
definition
there
are
words
of
authority
which
the
champions
forget
also
they
forget
magna
charta
that
great
called
most
august
diploma
and
sacred
anchor
of
english
liberties
where
after
declaring
that
shall
be
but
throughout
the
realm
it
is
announced
in
memorable
words
that
shall
be
disseized
of
his
freehold
or
liberties
but
by
legal
judgment
of
his
peers
or
by
the
law
of
the
land
meaning
of
course
the
law
of
the
whole
land
contradistinction
to
any
local
the
words
with
which
this
great
guaranty
begin
still
resound
liber
freeman
shall
be
denied
the
liberties
which
belong
to
freemen
the
champions
also
forget
that
federalist
in
commending
the
constitution
at
the
time
of
its
adoption
insisted
that
if
the
slaves
became
free
they
would
be
entitled
to
representation
i
have
quoted
the
potent
words
before
and
now
i
quote
them
again
is
only
under
the
pretext
that
the
laws
have
transformed
the
negroes
into
subjects
of
property
that
a
place
is
denied
to
them
in
the
computation
of
numbers
and
it
is
admitted
that
if
the
laws
were
to
restore
the
rights
which
have
been
taken
away
the
negroes
could
no
longer
be
refused
an
equal
share
of
representation
with
the
other
the
champions
also
forget
that
in
the
debates
on
the
ratification
of
the
national
constitution
it
was
charged
by
its
opponents
and
admitted
by
its
friends
that
congress
was
empowered
to
correct
any
inequality
of
suffrage
i
content
myself
with
quoting
the
weighty
words
of
madison
in
the
virginia
convention
states
might
regulate
the
elections
on
the
principles
of
and
others
might
regulate
them
should
the
people
of
any
state
by
any
means
be
deprived
of
the
right
of
suffrage
was
judged
proper
that
it
should
be
remedied
by
the
general
if
the
elections
be
regulated
properly
by
the
state
legislatures
the
congressional
control
will
very
probably
never
be
exercised
the
power
appears
to
me
satisfactory
and
as
unlikely
to
be
abused
as
any
part
of
the
the
champions
also
forget
that
chief
justice
taney
in
that
very
dred
scott
decision
where
it
was
ruled
that
a
person
of
african
descent
could
not
be
a
citizen
of
the
united
states
admitted
that
if
he
were
once
a
citizen
that
is
if
he
were
once
admitted
to
be
a
component
part
of
the
he
would
be
entitled
to
the
equal
privileges
of
citizenship
here
are
some
of
his
emphatic
words
is
not
it
is
believed
to
be
found
in
the
theories
of
writers
on
government
or
in
any
actual
experiment
heretofore
tried
an
exposition
of
the
term
which
has
not
been
understood
as
conferring
actual
possession
and
enjoyment
or
the
perfect
right
of
acquisition
and
enjoyment
of
an
entire
equality
of
privileges
civil
and
thus
from
every
authority
early
and
late
from
magna
charta
wrung
out
of
king
john
at
runnymede
from
hamilton
writing
in
federalist
from
madison
speaking
in
the
convention
at
richmond
from
taney
presiding
in
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
is
there
one
harmonious
testimony
to
the
equal
rights
of
citizenship
if
in
the
original
text
of
the
constitution
there
could
be
any
doubt
it
was
all
relieved
by
the
amendment
abolishing
slavery
and
empowering
congress
to
enforce
this
provision
already
congress
in
the
exercise
of
this
power
has
passed
a
rights
it
only
remains
that
it
should
now
pass
a
rights
which
like
the
former
shall
help
consummate
the
abolition
of
slavery
according
to
a
familiar
rule
of
interpretation
expounded
by
chief
justice
marshall
in
his
most
masterly
judgment
congress
when
intrusted
with
any
power
is
at
liberty
to
select
the
for
its
execution
the
civil
rights
act
came
under
the
head
of
selected
by
congress
and
a
political
rights
act
will
have
the
same
authority
you
may
as
well
deny
the
constitutionality
of
the
one
as
of
the
other
the
amendment
abolishing
slavery
has
been
reinforced
by
another
known
as
article
which
declares
peremptorily
that
state
shall
make
or
enforce
any
law
which
shall
abridge
the
privileges
or
immunities
of
citizens
of
the
united
states
and
again
congress
is
empowered
to
enforce
this
provision
what
can
be
broader
colored
persons
are
citizens
of
the
united
states
and
no
state
can
abridge
their
privileges
or
immunities
it
is
a
mockery
to
say
that
under
these
explicit
words
congress
is
powerless
to
forbid
any
discrimination
of
color
at
the
why
then
were
they
inscribed
in
the
constitution
to
what
end
there
they
stand
supplying
additional
and
supernumerary
power
ample
for
safeguard
against
caste
or
oligarchy
of
the
skin
no
matter
how
strongly
sanctioned
by
any
state
government
but
the
champions
anxious
for
state
rights
against
human
rights
strive
to
parry
this
positive
text
by
insisting
that
in
another
provision
of
this
same
amendment
the
power
over
the
right
to
vote
is
conceded
to
the
states
mark
now
the
audacity
and
fragility
of
this
pretext
it
is
true
that
the
right
to
vote
is
denied
to
any
of
the
male
inhabitants
of
a
state
or
in
any
way
abridged
except
for
participation
in
rebellion
or
other
crime
the
basis
of
representation
is
reduced
in
corresponding
proportion
such
is
the
penalty
imposed
by
the
constitution
on
a
state
which
denies
the
right
to
vote
except
in
a
specific
case
but
this
penalty
on
the
state
does
not
in
any
way
by
the
most
distant
implication
impair
the
plenary
powers
of
congress
to
enforce
the
guaranty
of
a
republican
government
the
abolition
of
slavery
and
that
final
clause
guarding
the
rights
of
citizens
three
specific
powers
which
are
left
undisturbed
unless
the
old
spirit
of
slavery
is
once
more
revived
and
congress
is
compelled
again
to
wear
those
degrading
chains
which
for
so
long
a
time
rendered
it
powerless
for
human
rights
the
pretension
that
the
powers
of
congress
derived
from
the
constitution
and
its
supplementary
texts
were
all
foreclosed
and
that
the
definition
of
a
republican
government
was
dishonored
merely
by
the
indirect
operation
of
the
clause
imposing
a
penalty
upon
a
state
is
the
last
effort
of
the
champions
they
are
driven
to
the
assumption
that
all
these
beneficent
powers
have
been
taken
away
by
indirection
and
that
a
provision
evidently
temporary
and
limited
can
have
this
overwhelming
consequence
they
set
up
a
technical
rule
of
law
unius
est
exclusio
it
is
impossible
to
see
the
application
of
this
technicality
because
the
basis
of
representation
is
reduced
in
proportion
to
any
denial
of
the
right
to
vote
therefore
it
is
argued
the
denial
of
the
right
to
vote
is
placed
beyond
the
reach
of
congress
notwithstanding
all
its
plenary
powers
from
so
many
sources
it
is
enough
to
say
of
this
conclusion
that
it
is
as
strong
as
anything
founded
on
the
of
the
in
really
sir
it
is
too
bad
that
so
great
a
cause
should
be
treated
with
such
levity
president
i
make
haste
to
the
conclusion
unwilling
to
protract
this
debate
i
open
the
question
in
glimpses
only
even
in
this
imperfect
way
it
is
clearly
seen
first
that
there
is
nothing
absolutely
nothing
in
the
national
constitution
to
sustain
the
pretension
of
caste
or
oligarchy
of
the
skin
as
set
up
by
certain
states
and
secondly
that
there
is
in
the
national
constitution
a
succession
and
reduplication
of
powers
investing
congress
with
ample
authority
to
repress
any
such
pretension
in
this
conclusion
i
raise
no
question
on
the
power
of
states
to
regulate
the
suffrage
i
do
not
ask
congress
to
undertake
any
such
regulation
i
simply
propose
that
under
the
pretence
of
regulating
the
suffrage
states
shall
not
exercise
a
prerogative
hostile
to
human
rights
without
any
authority
under
the
national
constitution
and
in
defiance
of
its
positive
texts
i
am
now
brought
directly
to
the
proposed
amendment
of
the
constitution
of
course
the
question
stares
us
in
the
face
why
amend
what
is
already
sufficient
why
erect
a
supernumerary
column
so
far
as
i
know
two
reasons
are
assigned
the
first
is
that
the
power
of
congress
is
doubtful
it
is
natural
that
those
who
do
not
sympathize
strongly
with
the
equal
rights
of
all
should
doubt
men
ordinarily
find
in
the
constitution
what
is
in
themselves
so
that
the
constitution
in
its
meaning
is
little
more
than
a
reflection
of
their
own
inner
nature
as
i
am
unable
to
find
any
ground
of
doubt
in
substance
or
even
in
shadow
i
shrink
from
a
proposition
which
assumes
that
there
is
doubt
to
my
mind
the
power
is
too
clear
for
question
as
well
question
the
obligation
of
congress
to
guaranty
a
republican
form
of
government
or
the
abolition
of
slavery
or
the
prohibition
upon
states
to
interfere
with
the
rights
and
privileges
of
citizenship
each
of
which
is
beyond
question
another
reason
assigned
for
a
constitutional
amendment
is
its
permanent
character
in
comparison
with
an
act
of
congress
which
may
be
repealed
on
this
head
i
have
no
anxiety
let
this
beneficent
prohibition
once
find
place
in
our
and
it
will
be
lasting
as
the
national
constitution
itself
to
which
it
will
be
only
a
legitimate
corollary
in
harmony
with
the
declaration
of
independence
and
in
harmony
with
the
national
constitution
it
will
become
of
equal
significance
and
no
profane
hand
will
touch
its
sacred
text
it
will
never
be
repealed
the
elective
franchise
once
recognized
can
never
be
denied
once
conferred
can
never
be
resumed
the
rule
of
equal
rights
once
applied
by
congress
under
the
national
constitution
will
be
a
permanent
institution
as
long
as
the
republic
endures
for
it
will
be
a
vital
part
of
that
republican
government
to
which
the
nation
is
pledged
dismissing
the
reasons
for
the
amendment
i
turn
to
those
which
make
us
hesitate
there
are
two
the
amendment
admits
that
under
the
national
constitution
as
it
is
with
its
recent
additions
a
caste
and
an
oligarchy
of
the
skin
may
be
set
up
by
a
state
without
any
check
from
congress
that
these
ignoble
forms
of
inequality
are
consistent
with
republican
government
and
that
the
right
to
vote
is
not
an
existing
privilege
and
immunity
of
citizenship
all
this
is
plainly
admitted
by
the
proposed
amendment
thus
despoiling
congress
of
beneficent
powers
and
emasculating
the
national
constitution
itself
it
is
only
with
infinite
reluctance
that
i
consent
to
any
such
admission
which
in
the
endeavor
to
satisfy
ungenerous
scruples
weakens
all
those
texts
which
are
so
important
for
human
rights
the
hesitation
to
present
the
amendment
is
increased
when
we
consider
the
difficulties
in
the
way
of
its
ratification
i
am
no
arithmetician
but
i
understand
that
nobody
has
yet
been
able
to
enumerate
the
states
whose
votes
can
be
counted
on
to
assure
its
ratification
within
any
reasonable
time
meanwhile
this
great
question
which
can
not
brook
delay
which
for
the
sake
of
peace
and
to
complete
reconstruction
should
be
settled
at
once
is
handed
over
to
prolonged
controversy
in
the
states
i
need
not
depict
the
evils
which
must
ensue
a
state
will
become
for
the
time
a
political
caldron
into
which
will
be
dropped
all
the
poisoned
ingredients
of
prejudice
and
hate
while
a
powerful
political
party
chanting
like
the
witches
in
double
toil
and
trouble
fire
burn
and
caldron
bubble
will
use
this
very
amendment
as
the
with
which
to
stir
the
bubbling
mass
such
a
controversy
should
be
avoided
if
possible
nor
should
an
agitation
so
unwelcome
and
so
sterile
be
needlessly
invited
us
have
of
course
if
there
were
no
other
way
of
accomplishing
the
great
result
the
amendment
should
be
presented
even
with
all
its
delays
uncertainties
and
provocations
to
local
strife
but
happily
all
these
are
unnecessary
the
same
thing
may
be
accomplished
by
act
of
congress
without
any
delay
without
any
uncertainty
and
without
any
provocation
to
local
strife
the
same
vote
of
two
thirds
required
for
the
presentation
of
the
amendment
will
pass
the
act
over
the
veto
of
the
president
once
adopted
it
will
go
into
instant
operation
without
waiting
for
the
uncertain
concurrence
of
state
legislatures
and
without
provoking
local
strife
so
wearisome
to
the
country
the
states
will
not
be
turned
into
political
caldrons
and
the
democratic
party
will
have
no
with
which
to
stir
the
bubbling
mass
i
do
not
depart
from
the
proprieties
of
this
occasion
when
i
show
how
completely
the
course
i
now
propose
harmonizes
with
the
requirements
of
the
political
party
to
which
i
belong
believing
most
sincerely
that
the
republican
party
in
its
objects
is
identical
with
country
and
with
mankind
so
that
in
sustaining
it
i
sustain
these
comprehensive
charities
i
can
not
willingly
see
this
agency
lose
the
opportunity
of
confirming
its
supremacy
you
need
votes
in
connecticut
do
you
not
there
are
three
thousand
in
that
state
ready
at
the
call
of
congress
to
take
their
place
at
the
you
need
them
also
in
pennsylvania
do
you
not
there
are
at
least
fifteen
thousand
in
that
great
state
waiting
for
your
summons
wherever
you
most
need
them
there
they
are
and
be
assured
they
will
all
vote
for
those
who
stand
by
them
in
the
assertion
of
equal
rights
in
standing
by
them
you
stand
by
all
that
is
most
dear
in
the
republic
pardon
me
but
if
you
are
not
moved
by
considerations
of
justice
under
the
constitution
then
i
appeal
to
that
humbler
motive
which
is
found
in
the
desire
for
success
do
this
and
you
will
assure
the
triumph
of
all
that
you
can
most
desire
party
country
mankind
will
be
elevated
while
the
equal
rights
of
all
will
be
fixed
on
a
foundation
not
less
enduring
than
the
rock
of
ages
the
bill
offered
by
sumner
as
a
substitute
for
the
original
joint
resolution
was
rejected
and
the
latter
embodying
the
proposed
amendment
to
the
constitution
failed
for
want
of
the
requisite
of
the
votes
cast
these
standing
yeas
nays
claims
on
england
individual
and
national
speech
on
the
treaty
in
executive
session
of
the
senate
april
president
a
report
recommending
that
the
senate
do
not
advise
and
consent
to
a
treaty
with
a
foreign
power
duly
signed
by
the
plenipotentiary
of
the
nation
is
of
rare
occurrence
treaties
are
often
reported
with
amendments
and
sometimes
without
any
recommendation
but
i
do
not
recall
an
instance
since
i
came
into
the
senate
where
such
a
treaty
has
been
reported
with
the
recommendation
which
is
now
under
consideration
the
character
of
the
treaty
seemed
to
justify
the
exceptional
report
the
committee
did
not
hesitate
in
the
conclusion
that
it
ought
to
be
rejected
and
they
have
said
so
i
do
not
disguise
the
importance
of
this
act
but
i
believe
that
in
the
interest
of
peace
which
every
one
should
have
at
heart
the
treaty
must
be
rejected
a
treaty
which
instead
of
removing
an
existing
grievance
leaves
it
for
and
rancor
can
not
be
considered
a
settlement
of
pending
questions
between
two
nations
it
may
seem
to
settle
them
but
does
not
it
is
nothing
but
a
snare
and
such
is
the
character
of
the
treaty
now
before
us
the
massive
grievance
under
which
our
country
suffered
for
years
is
left
untouched
the
painful
sense
of
wrong
planted
in
the
national
heart
is
allowed
to
remain
for
all
this
there
is
not
one
word
of
regret
or
even
of
recognition
nor
is
there
any
semblance
of
compensation
it
can
not
be
for
the
interest
of
either
party
that
such
a
treaty
should
be
ratified
it
can
not
promote
the
interest
of
the
united
states
for
we
naturally
seek
justice
as
the
foundation
of
a
good
understanding
with
great
britain
nor
can
it
promote
the
interest
of
great
britain
which
must
also
seek
a
real
settlement
of
all
pending
questions
surely
i
do
not
err
when
i
say
that
a
wise
statesmanship
whether
on
our
side
or
on
the
other
side
must
apply
itself
to
find
the
real
root
of
evil
and
then
with
courage
tempered
by
candor
and
moderation
see
that
it
is
extirpated
this
is
for
the
interest
of
both
parties
and
anything
short
of
it
is
a
failure
it
is
sufficient
to
say
that
the
present
treaty
does
no
such
thing
and
that
whatever
may
have
been
the
disposition
of
the
negotiators
the
real
root
of
evil
remains
untouched
in
all
its
original
strength
i
make
these
remarks
merely
to
characterize
the
treaty
and
prepare
the
way
for
its
consideration
the
pending
treaty
if
we
look
at
the
negotiation
which
immediately
preceded
the
treaty
we
find
little
to
commend
you
have
it
on
your
table
i
think
i
am
not
mistaken
when
i
say
that
it
shows
a
haste
which
finds
few
precedents
in
diplomacy
but
which
is
explained
by
the
anxiety
to
reach
a
conclusion
before
the
advent
of
a
new
administration
seward
and
reverdy
johnson
unite
in
this
unprecedented
activity
using
the
atlantic
cable
freely
i
should
not
object
to
haste
or
to
the
freest
use
of
the
cable
if
the
result
were
such
as
could
be
approved
but
considering
the
character
of
the
transaction
and
how
completely
the
treaty
conceals
the
main
cause
of
offence
it
seems
as
if
the
honorable
negotiators
were
engaged
in
huddling
something
out
of
sight
the
treaty
has
for
its
model
the
claims
convention
of
to
take
such
a
convention
as
a
model
was
a
strange
mistake
this
convention
was
for
the
settlement
of
outstanding
claims
of
american
citizens
on
great
britain
and
of
british
subjects
on
the
united
states
which
had
arisen
since
the
treaty
of
ghent
in
it
concerned
individuals
only
and
not
the
nation
it
was
not
in
any
respect
political
nor
was
it
to
remove
any
sense
of
national
wrong
to
take
such
a
convention
as
the
model
for
a
treaty
which
was
to
determine
a
national
grievance
of
transcendent
importance
in
the
relations
of
two
countries
marked
on
the
threshold
an
insensibility
to
the
true
nature
of
the
difference
to
be
settled
at
once
it
belittled
the
work
to
be
done
an
inspection
of
the
treaty
shows
how
from
beginning
to
end
it
is
merely
for
the
settlement
of
individual
claims
on
both
sides
putting
the
two
batches
on
an
equality
so
that
the
sufferers
by
the
misconduct
of
england
may
be
counterbalanced
by
british
it
opens
with
a
preamble
which
instead
of
announcing
the
unprecedented
question
between
the
two
countries
simply
refers
to
individual
claims
that
have
arisen
since
the
last
time
of
settlement
some
of
which
are
still
pending
and
remain
unsettled
who
would
believe
that
under
these
words
of
commonplace
was
concealed
the
unsettled
difference
which
has
already
so
deeply
stirred
the
american
people
and
is
destined
until
finally
adjusted
to
occupy
the
attention
of
the
civilized
world
nothing
here
gives
notice
of
the
real
question
i
quote
the
preamble
as
it
is
the
to
the
treaty
claims
have
at
various
times
since
the
exchange
of
the
ratifications
of
the
convention
between
great
britain
and
the
united
states
of
america
signed
at
london
on
the
of
february
been
made
upon
the
government
of
her
britannic
majesty
on
the
part
of
citizens
of
the
united
states
and
upon
the
government
of
the
united
states
on
the
part
of
subjects
of
her
britannic
majesty
and
whereas
of
such
claims
are
still
pending
and
remain
her
majesty
the
queen
of
the
united
kingdom
of
great
britain
and
ireland
and
the
president
of
the
united
states
of
america
being
of
opinion
that
a
speedy
and
equitable
settlement
of
all
such
claims
will
contribute
much
to
the
maintenance
of
the
friendly
feelings
which
subsist
between
the
two
countries
have
resolved
to
make
arrangements
for
that
purpose
by
means
of
a
the
provisions
of
the
treaty
are
for
the
trial
of
these
cases
a
commission
is
constituted
which
is
empowered
to
choose
an
arbitrator
but
in
the
event
of
a
failure
to
agree
the
arbitrator
shall
be
determined
from
two
persons
one
named
by
each
side
even
if
this
aleatory
proceeding
were
a
proper
device
in
the
umpirage
of
private
claims
it
is
strangely
inconsistent
with
the
solemnity
which
belongs
to
the
present
question
the
moral
sense
is
disturbed
by
such
a
process
at
any
stage
of
the
trial
nor
is
it
satisfied
by
the
subsequent
provision
for
the
selection
of
a
sovereign
or
head
of
a
friendly
state
as
arbitrator
the
treaty
not
merely
makes
no
provision
for
the
determination
of
the
great
question
but
it
seems
to
provide
expressly
that
it
shall
never
hereafter
be
presented
a
petty
provision
for
individual
claims
subject
to
a
by
the
individual
claims
of
england
so
that
in
the
end
our
country
may
possibly
receive
nothing
is
the
consideration
for
this
strange
surrender
i
borrow
a
term
from
an
english
statesman
on
another
occasion
if
i
call
it
a
for
the
settlement
of
a
few
individual
claims
we
condone
the
original
and
destructive
wrong
here
are
the
plain
words
by
which
this
is
done
high
contracting
parties
engage
to
consider
the
result
of
the
proceedings
of
this
commission
as
a
full
and
final
settlement
of
every
claim
upon
either
government
arising
out
of
any
transaction
of
a
date
prior
to
the
exchange
of
the
ratifications
of
the
present
convention
and
further
engage
that
every
such
claim
whether
or
not
the
same
may
have
been
presented
to
the
notice
of
made
preferred
or
laid
before
the
said
commission
shall
from
and
after
the
conclusion
of
the
proceedings
of
the
said
commission
be
considered
and
treated
as
finally
settled
and
barred
and
thenceforth
all
this
i
quote
directly
from
the
treaty
it
is
article
the
national
cause
is
handled
as
nothing
more
than
a
bundle
of
individual
claims
and
the
result
of
the
proceedings
under
the
proposed
treaty
is
to
be
full
and
final
settlement
so
that
hereafter
all
claims
be
considered
and
treated
as
finally
settled
and
barred
and
thenceforth
here
is
no
provision
for
the
real
question
which
though
thrust
out
of
sight
or
declared
to
be
settled
and
barred
according
to
the
terms
of
the
treaty
must
return
to
plague
the
two
countries
whatever
the
treaty
may
say
in
terms
there
is
no
settlement
in
fact
and
until
this
is
made
there
will
be
constant
menace
of
discord
nor
can
it
be
forgotten
that
there
is
no
recognition
of
the
rule
of
international
duty
applicable
to
such
cases
this
too
is
left
unsettled
while
doing
so
little
for
us
the
treaty
makes
ample
provision
for
all
known
claims
on
the
british
side
as
these
are
exclusively
they
are
completely
covered
by
the
text
which
has
no
limitations
or
exceptions
already
it
is
announced
in
england
that
even
those
of
are
included
i
have
before
me
an
english
journal
which
describes
the
latter
claims
as
founded
on
quantities
of
cotton
worth
at
the
time
of
their
seizure
nearly
two
shillings
a
pound
which
were
then
in
the
legal
possession
of
those
and
the
same
authority
adds
claims
will
be
brought
indifferently
with
others
before
the
designed
joint
commission
whenever
it
shall
from
another
quarter
i
learn
that
these
bondholders
are
sanguine
of
success
the
treaty
as
it
is
and
certain
it
is
that
the
loan
went
up
from
to
as
soon
as
it
was
ascertained
that
the
treaty
was
i
doubt
if
the
american
people
are
ready
just
now
to
provide
for
any
such
claims
that
they
have
risen
in
the
market
is
an
argument
against
the
treaty
the
case
against
england
passing
from
the
treaty
i
come
now
to
consider
briefly
but
with
proper
precision
the
true
ground
of
complaint
and
here
again
we
shall
see
the
constant
inadequacy
of
the
remedy
now
applied
it
is
with
reluctance
that
i
enter
upon
this
statement
and
i
do
it
only
in
the
discharge
of
a
duty
which
can
not
be
postponed
close
upon
the
outbreak
of
our
troubles
little
more
than
one
month
after
the
bombardment
of
fort
sumter
when
the
rebellion
was
still
undeveloped
when
the
national
government
was
beginning
those
gigantic
efforts
which
ended
so
triumphantly
the
country
was
startled
by
the
news
that
the
british
government
had
intervened
by
a
proclamation
which
accorded
belligerent
rights
to
the
rebels
at
the
early
date
when
this
was
done
the
rebels
were
as
they
remained
to
the
close
without
ships
on
the
ocean
without
prize
courts
or
other
tribunal
for
the
administration
of
justice
on
the
ocean
any
of
those
conditions
which
are
the
essential
prerequisites
to
such
a
and
yet
the
concession
was
general
being
applicable
to
the
ocean
and
the
land
so
that
by
british
fiat
they
became
ocean
belligerents
as
well
as
land
belligerents
in
the
swiftness
of
this
bestowal
there
was
very
little
consideration
for
a
friendly
power
nor
does
it
appear
that
there
was
any
inquiry
into
those
on
which
it
must
depend
ocean
belligerency
being
a
and
not
a
can
be
recognized
only
on
evidence
showing
its
according
to
the
rule
first
stated
by
canning
and
afterward
recognized
by
lord

russell
but
no
such
evidence
was
adduced
for
it
did
not
exist
and
never
has
existed
too
much
stress
can
not
be
laid
upon
the
rule
that
belligerency
is
a
and
not
a
it
is
perhaps
the
most
important
contribution
to
this
discussion
and
its
original
statement
on
the
occasion
of
the
greek
revolution
does
honor
to
its
author
unquestionably
the
brightest
genius
ever
directed
to
this
subject
according
to
this
rule
belligerency
must
be
proved
to
exist
it
must
be
shown
it
can
not
be
imagined
or
divined
or
invented
it
must
exist
as
a
within
the
knowledge
of
the
world
or
at
least
as
a
susceptible
of
proof
nor
can
it
be
inferred
on
the
ocean
merely
from
its
existence
on
the
land
from
the
beginning
when
called
the
dry
land
earth
and
the
gathering
together
of
the
waters
called
he
seas
the
two
have
been
separate
and
power
over
one
has
not
necessarily
implied
power
over
the
other
there
is
a
dominion
of
the
land
and
a
dominion
of
the
ocean
but
whatever
power
the
rebels
possessed
on
the
land
they
were
always
without
power
on
the
ocean
admitting
that
they
were
belligerents
on
the
land
they
were
never
belligerents
on
the
ocean
oak
leviathans
whose
huge
ribs
make
their
clay
creator
the
vain
title
take
of
lord
of
thee
arbiter
of
these
they
never
possessed
such
was
the
that
must
govern
the
present
question
the
rule
so
simple
plain
and
intelligible
as
stated
by
canning
is
a
decisive
touchstone
of
the
british
concession
which
when
brought
to
it
is
found
to
be
without
support
unfriendly
in
the
precipitancy
with
which
it
was
launched
this
concession
was
more
unfriendly
in
substance
it
was
the
first
stage
in
the
depredations
on
our
commerce
had
it
not
been
made
no
rebel
ship
could
have
been
built
in
england
every
step
in
her
building
would
have
been
piracy
nor
could
any
munitions
of
war
have
been
furnished
not
a
laden
with
supplies
could
have
left
the
english
shores
except
under
a
kindred
penalty
the
direct
consequence
of
this
concession
was
to
place
the
rebels
on
an
equality
with
ourselves
in
all
british
markets
whether
of
ships
or
munitions
of
war
as
these
were
open
to
the
national
government
so
they
were
open
to
the
rebels
the
asserted
neutrality
between
the
two
began
by
this
tremendous
concession
when
the
rebels
at
one
stroke
were
transformed
not
only
into
belligerents
but
into
customers
in
attributing
to
that
bad
proclamation
this
peculiar
influence
i
follow
the
authority
of
the
law
lords
of
england
who
according
to
authentic
report
announced
that
without
it
the
fitting
out
of
a
ship
in
england
to
cruise
against
the
united
states
would
have
been
an
act
of
piracy
this
conclusion
was
clearly
stated
by
lord
chelmsford
speaking
for
himself
and
others
when
he
said
the
southern
confederacy
had
not
been
recognized
by
us
as
belligerent
he
agreed
with
his
noble
and
learned
friend
lord
brougham
that
any
englishman
aiding
them
by
fitting
out
a
privateer
against
the
federal
government
be
guilty
of
this
conclusion
is
only
according
to
analogies
of
law
it
is
criminal
for
british
subjects
to
forge
bombs
or
to
be
employed
in
the
assassination
of
a
foreign
sovereign
at
peace
with
england
as
when
bernard
supplied
from
england
the
missiles
used
by
orsini
against
the
life
of
the
french
emperor
all
of
which
is
illustrated
by
lord
campbell
in
his
charge
to
the
jury
on
the
trial
of
bernard
and
also
by
contemporaneous
opinions
of
lord
lyndhurst
lord
brougham
lord
truro
and
at
an
earlier
day
by
lord
ellenborough
in
a
case
of
libel
on
the
first
consul
that
excellent
authority
sir
george
cornewall
lewis
gives
a
summary
drawn
from
all
these
opinions
when
he
says
obligation
incumbent
upon
a
state
of
preventing
her
soil
from
being
used
an
in
which
the
means
of
attack
against
a
foreign
government
may
be
collected
and
prepared
for
use
is
wholly
independent
of
the
form
and
character
of
that
as
every
government
is
constrained
by
this
rule
so
every
government
is
entitled
to
its
safeguards
there
can
be
no
reason
why
the
life
of
our
republic
should
be
less
sacred
than
the
life
of
an
emperor
or
should
enjoy
less
protection
from
british
law
that
england
became
an
for
the
rebels
we
know
but
this
could
not
have
been
unless
the
proclamation
had
prepared
the
way
the
only
justification
that
i
have
heard
for
this
extraordinary
concession
which
unleashed
upon
our
country
the
furies
of
war
to
commingle
with
the
furies
of
rebellion
at
home
is
that
president
lincoln
undertook
to
proclaim
a
of
the
rebel
ports
by
the
use
of
this
word
the
concession
is
vindicated
had
president
lincoln
proclaimed
a
of
the
rebel
ports
there
could
have
been
no
such
concession
this
is
a
mere
technicality
lawyers
might
call
it
an
and
yet
on
this
sharp
point
england
hangs
her
defence
it
is
sufficient
that
in
a
great
case
like
the
present
where
the
correlative
duties
of
a
friendly
power
are
in
question
an
act
fraught
with
such
portentous
evil
can
not
be
vindicated
on
a
technicality
in
this
debate
there
is
no
room
for
technicality
on
either
side
we
must
look
at
the
substance
and
find
a
reason
in
nothing
short
of
overruling
necessity
war
can
not
be
justified
merely
on
a
technicality
nor
can
the
concession
of
ocean
belligerency
to
rebels
without
a
port
or
prize
court
such
a
concession
like
war
itself
must
be
at
the
peril
of
the
nation
making
it
the
british
assumption
besides
being
offensive
from
mere
technicality
is
inconsistent
with
the
proclamation
of
the
president
taken
as
a
whole
which
while
appointing
a
blockade
is
careful
to
reserve
the
rights
of
sovereignty
thus
putting
foreign
powers
on
their
guard
against
any
premature
concession
after
declaring
an
existing
insurrection
in
certain
states
and
the
obstruction
of
the
laws
for
the
collection
of
the
revenue
as
the
motive
for
action
the
president
invokes
not
only
the
law
of
nations
but
laws
of
the
united
states
and
in
further
assertion
of
the
national
sovereignty
declares
rebel
cruisers
to
be
pirates
clearly
the
proclamation
must
be
taken
as
a
whole
and
its
different
provisions
so
interpreted
as
to
harmonize
with
each
other
if
they
can
not
stand
together
then
it
is
the
which
must
be
modified
by
the
national
sovereignty
and
not
the
national
sovereignty
by
the
blockade
such
should
have
been
the
interpretation
of
a
friendly
power
especially
when
it
is
considered
that
there
are
numerous
precedents
of
what
the
great
german
authority
heffter
calls
blockade
or
blockade
without
concession
of
ocean
belligerency
as
in
the
case
of
france
england
and
russia
against
turkey
france
against
mexico
france
and
great
britain
against
the
argentine
republic
russia
against
the
circassians
illustrated
by
the
seizure
of
the
vixen
so
famous
in
diplomatic
history
cases
like
these
led
heffter
to
lay
down
the
rule
that
does
not
necessarily
constitute
state
of
regular
as
was
assumed
by
the
british
proclamation
even
in
the
face
of
positive
words
by
president
lincoln
asserting
the
national
sovereignty
and
appealing
to
laws
of
the
united
the
existence
of
such
cases
was
like
a
notice
to
the
british
government
against
the
concession
so
rashly
made
it
was
an
warning
which
this
power
disregarded
so
far
as
is
now
known
the
whole
case
for
england
is
made
to
stand
on
the
use
of
the
word
by
president
lincoln
had
he
used
any
other
word
the
concession
of
belligerency
would
have
been
without
justification
even
such
as
is
now
imagined
it
was
this
word
which
with
magical
might
opened
the
gates
to
all
those
bountiful
supplies
by
which
hostile
expeditions
were
equipped
against
the
united
states
it
opened
the
gates
of
war
most
appalling
is
it
to
think
that
one
little
word
unconsciously
used
by
a
trusting
president
could
be
caught
up
by
a
friendly
power
and
made
to
play
such
a
part
i
may
add
that
there
is
one
other
word
often
invoked
for
apology
it
is
which
it
is
said
was
proclaimed
between
two
belligerents
nothing
could
be
fairer
always
provided
that
the
proclaimed
did
not
begin
with
a
concession
to
one
party
without
which
this
party
would
be
powerless
between
two
established
nations
both
independent
as
between
russia
and
france
there
may
be
neutrality
for
the
two
are
already
equal
in
rights
and
the
proclamation
would
be
precisely
equal
in
its
operation
but
where
one
party
is
an
established
nation
and
the
other
is
nothing
but
an
odious
combination
of
rebels
the
proclamation
is
most
unequal
in
operation
for
it
begins
by
a
solemn
investiture
of
rebels
with
all
the
rights
of
war
saying
to
them
as
was
once
said
to
the
youthful
knight
here
is
a
sword
use
to
call
such
an
investiture
a
proclamation
of
neutrality
is
a
misnomer
it
was
a
proclamation
of
equality
between
the
national
government
on
the
one
side
and
rebels
on
the
other
and
no
plausible
word
can
obscure
this
distinctive
character
then
came
the
building
of
the
pirate
ships
one
after
another
while
the
alabama
was
still
in
the
it
became
apparent
that
she
was
intended
for
the
rebels
our
minister
at
london
and
our
consul
at
liverpool
exerted
themselves
for
her
arrest
and
detention
they
were
put
off
from
day
to
day
on
the
july
adams
his
evidence
accompanied
by
an
opinion
from
the
eminent
barrister
collier
afterward
declaring
the
plain
duty
of
the
british
government
to
stop
her
instead
of
acting
promptly
by
the
telegraph
five
days
were
allowed
to
run
out
when
at
last
too
tardily
the
necessary
order
was
dispatched
meanwhile
the
pirate
ship
escaped
from
the
port
of
liverpool
by
a
stratagem
and
her
voyage
began
with
music
and
frolic
here
beyond
all
question
was
negligence
or
according
to
the
language
of
lord
brougham
on
another
occasion
negligence
making
england
justly
responsible
for
all
that
ensued
the
pirate
ship
found
refuge
in
an
obscure
harbor
of
wales
known
as
moelfra
bay
where
she
lay
in
british
waters
seven
july
to
about
three
july
being
upward
of
hours
and
during
this
time
she
was
supplied
with
men
from
the
british
hercules
which
followed
her
from
liverpool
these
hours
were
allowed
to
elapse
without
any
attempt
to
stop
her
here
was
another
stage
of
thus
was
there
negligence
in
allowing
the
building
to
proceed
negligence
in
allowing
the
escape
from
liverpool
and
negligence
in
allowing
the
final
escape
from
the
british
coast
lord
russell
while
trying
to
vindicate
his
government
and
repelling
the
complaints
of
the
united
states
more
than
once
admitted
that
the
escape
of
the
alabama
was
scandal
and
a
reproach
which
to
my
mind
is
very
like
a
confession
language
could
not
be
stronger
surely
such
an
act
can
not
be
blameless
if
damages
are
ever
awarded
to
a
friendly
power
for
injuries
received
it
is
difficult
to
see
where
they
could
be
more
strenuously
claimed
than
in
a
case
which
the
first
minister
of
the
offending
power
did
not
hesitate
to
characterize
so
strongly
the
enlistment
of
the
crew
was
not
less
obnoxious
to
censure
than
the
building
of
the
ship
and
her
escape
it
was
a
part
of
the
transaction
the
evidence
is
explicit
not
to
occupy
too
much
time
i
refer
only
to
the
deposition
of
william
passmore
who
swears
that
he
was
engaged
with
the
express
understanding
that
vessel
was
going
out
to
the
government
of
the
confederate
states
of
america
fight
for
the
southern
that
he
joined
her
at
yard
at
birkenhead
near
liverpool
remaining
there
several
weeks
that
there
were
about
thirty
men
on
board
most
of
them
old
men
among
whom
it
was
known
that
the
vessel
was
going
out
as
a
privateer
for
the
confederate
government
to
act
against
the
united
states
under
a
commission
from
jefferson
in
a
list
of
the
crew
now
before
me
there
is
a
large
number
said
to
be
from
the
naval
i
might
add
to
this
testimony
the
more
the
case
is
examined
the
more
clearly
do
we
discern
the
character
of
the
transaction
the
dedication
of
the
ship
to
the
rebel
service
from
the
very
laying
of
the
keel
and
the
organization
of
her
voyage
with
england
as
her
from
which
she
drew
munitions
of
war
and
men
made
her
departure
as
much
hostile
as
if
she
had
sailed
forth
from
her
at
a
moment
of
profound
peace
between
the
united
states
and
england
there
was
a
hostile
expedition
against
the
united
states
it
was
in
no
just
sense
a
commercial
transaction
but
an
act
of
war
the
case
is
not
yet
complete
the
alabama
whose
building
was
in
defiance
of
law
international
and
municipal
whose
escape
was
scandal
and
a
reproach
and
whose
enlistment
of
her
crew
was
a
fit
sequel
to
the
rest
after
being
supplied
with
an
armament
and
with
a
rebel
commander
entered
upon
her
career
of
piracy
mark
now
a
new
stage
of
complicity
constantly
the
pirate
ship
was
within
reach
of
british
cruisers
and
from
time
to
time
within
the
shelter
of
british
ports
for
five
days
unmolested
she
enjoyed
the
pleasant
hospitality
of
kingston
in
jamaica
obtaining
freely
the
coal
and
other
supplies
so
necessary
to
her
vocation
but
no
british
cruiser
no
british
magistrate
ever
arrested
the
offending
ship
whose
voyage
was
a
continuing
and
to
the
british
government
the
excuse
for
this
strange
license
is
a
curious
technicality
as
if
a
technicality
could
avail
in
this
case
at
any
stage
borrowing
a
phrase
from
that
master
of
admiralty
jurisprudence
sir
william
scott
it
is
said
that
the
ship
her
original
sin
at
the
conclusion
of
her
voyage
so
that
afterward
she
was
blameless
but
the
alabama
never
concluded
her
voyage
until
she
sank
under
the
guns
of
the
kearsarge
because
she
never
had
a
port
of
her
own
she
was
no
better
than
the
flying
dutchman
and
so
long
as
she
sailed
was
liable
for
that
original
sin
which
had
impregnated
every
plank
with
an
indelible
dye
no
british
cruiser
could
allow
her
to
proceed
no
british
port
could
give
her
shelter
without
renewing
the
complicity
of
england
the
alabama
case
begins
with
a
fatal
concession
by
which
the
rebels
were
enabled
to
build
ships
in
england
and
then
to
sail
them
without
being
liable
as
pirates
it
next
shows
itself
in
the
building
of
the
ship
in
the
armament
and
in
the
escape
with
so
much
of
negligence
on
the
part
of
the
british
government
as
to
constitute
sufferance
if
not
connivance
and
then
again
the
case
reappears
in
the
welcome
and
hospitality
accorded
by
british
cruisers
and
by
the
magistrates
of
british
ports
to
the
pirate
ship
when
her
evasion
from
british
jurisdiction
was
well
known
thus
at
three
different
stages
the
british
government
is
compromised
first
in
the
concession
of
ocean
belligerency
on
which
all
depended
secondly
in
the
negligence
which
allowed
the
evasion
of
the
ship
in
order
to
enter
upon
the
hostile
expedition
for
which
she
was
built
manned
armed
and
equipped
and
thirdly
in
the
open
complicity
which
after
this
evasion
gave
her
welcome
hospitality
and
supplies
in
british
ports
thus
her
depredations
and
burnings
making
the
ocean
blaze
all
proceeded
from
england
which
by
three
different
acts
lighted
the
torch
to
england
must
be
traced
also
all
the
consequences
which
ensued
i
take
the
case
of
the
alabama
because
it
is
the
best
known
and
because
the
building
equipment
and
escape
of
this
ship
were
under
circumstances
most
obnoxious
to
judgment
but
it
will
not
be
forgotten
that
there
were
consort
ships
built
under
the
shelter
of
that
fatal
proclamation
issued
in
such
an
eclipse
of
just
principles
and
like
the
ships
it
unloosed
with
curses
one
after
another
ships
were
built
one
after
another
they
escaped
on
their
errand
and
one
after
another
they
enjoyed
the
immunities
of
british
ports
audacity
reached
its
height
when
rams
were
built
and
the
perversity
of
the
british
government
became
still
more
conspicuous
by
its
long
refusal
to
arrest
these
destructive
engines
of
war
destined
to
be
employed
against
the
united
states
this
protracted
hesitation
where
the
consequences
were
so
menacing
is
a
part
of
the
case
it
is
plain
that
the
ships
which
were
built
under
the
safeguard
of
this
proclamation
which
stole
forth
from
the
british
shores
and
afterward
enjoyed
the
immunities
of
british
ports
were
not
only
british
in
origin
but
british
in
equipment
british
in
armament
and
british
in
crews
they
were
british
in
every
respect
except
in
their
commanders
who
were
rebel
and
one
of
these
as
his
ship
was
sinking
owed
his
safety
to
a
british
yacht
symbolizing
the
omnipresent
support
of
england
british
sympathies
were
active
in
their
behalf
the
cheers
of
a
british
crossing
the
path
of
the
alabama
encouraged
the
work
of
piracy
and
the
cheers
of
the
house
of
commons
encouraged
the
builder
of
the
alabama
while
he
defended
what
he
had
done
and
exclaimed
in
taunt
to
him
who
is
now
an
illustrious
member
of
the
british
cabinet
john
bright
that
he
rather
be
handed
down
to
posterity
as
the
builder
of
a
dozen
than
be
the
author
of
the
speeches
of
that
gentleman
the
institutions
of
the
united
states
which
the
builder
of
the
alabama
rising
with
his
theme
denounced
as
no
value
whatever
and
as
the
very
name
of
liberty
to
an
utter
absurdity
while
the
cheers
of
the
house
of
commons
echoed
back
his
words
thus
from
beginning
to
end
from
the
fatal
proclamation
to
the
rejoicing
of
the
accidental
ship
and
the
rejoicing
of
the
house
of
commons
was
this
hostile
expedition
protected
and
encouraged
by
england
the
same
spirit
which
dictated
the
swift
concession
of
belligerency
with
all
its
deadly
incidents
ruled
the
hour
entering
into
and
possessing
every
pirate
ship
there
are
two
circumstances
by
which
the
whole
case
is
aggravated
one
is
found
in
the
date
of
the
proclamation
which
lifted
the
rebels
to
an
equality
with
the
national
government
opening
to
them
everything
that
was
open
to
us
whether
foundries
or
manufactories
and
giving
to
them
a
flag
on
the
ocean
coëqual
with
the
flag
of
the
union
this
extraordinary
manifesto
was
signed
on
the
very
day
of
the
arrival
of
our
minister
in
england
so
that
when
after
an
ocean
voyage
he
reached
the
british
government
to
which
he
was
accredited
he
found
this
great
and
terrible
indignity
to
his
country
already
perpetrated
and
the
floodgates
opened
to
infinite
woes
the
minister
had
been
announced
he
was
daily
expected
the
british
government
knew
of
his
coming
but
in
hottest
haste
they
did
this
thing
the
other
aggravation
is
found
in
its
flagrant
unnatural
departure
from
that
antislavery
rule
which
by
manifold
declarations
legislative
political
and
diplomatic
was
the
avowed
creed
of
england
often
was
this
rule
proclaimed
but
if
we
except
the
great
act
of
emancipation
never
more
pointedly
than
in
the
famous
circular
of
lord
palmerston
while
minister
of
foreign
affairs
announcing
to
all
nations
that
england
was
pledged
to
the
universal
abolition
of
slavery
and
now
when
slaveholders
in
the
very
madness
of
barbarism
broke
away
from
the
national
government
and
attempted
to
found
a
new
empire
with
slavery
as
its
declared
antislavery
england
without
a
delay
without
even
waiting
the
arrival
of
our
minister
at
the
seat
of
government
although
known
to
be
on
his
way
made
haste
to
decree
that
this
shameful
and
impossible
pretension
should
enjoy
equal
rights
with
the
national
government
in
her
foundries
and
manufactories
and
equal
rights
on
the
ocean
such
was
the
decree
rebel
slaveholders
occupied
in
a
hideous
attempt
were
taken
by
the
hand
and
thus
with
the
official
protection
and
the
of
antislavery
england
commenced
their
accursed
work
i
close
this
part
of
the
argument
with
the
testimony
of
mr
bright
who
in
a
speech
at
rochdale
among
his
neighbors
february
thus
exhibits
the
criminal
complicity
of
england
regret
more
than
i
have
words
to
express
this
painful
fact
that
of
all
the
countries
in
europe
this
country
is
the
only
one
which
has
men
in
it
who
are
willing
to
take
active
steps
in
favor
of
this
intended
slave
government
we
supply
the
ships
we
supply
the
arms
the
munitions
of
war
give
aid
and
comfort
to
this
foulest
of
all
crimes
englishmen
only
do
in
further
illustration
and
in
support
of
allegation
i
refer
again
to
the
multitudinous
from
england
without
the
manifesto
of
belligerency
they
could
not
have
sailed
all
this
stealthy
fleet
charged
with
hostility
to
the
united
states
was
a
part
of
the
great
offence
the
were
kindred
to
the
pirate
ships
they
were
of
the
same
bad
family
having
their
origin
and
home
in
england
from
the
beginning
they
went
forth
with
their
cargoes
of
death
for
the
supplies
which
they
furnished
contributed
to
the
work
of
death
when
after
a
long
and
painful
siege
our
conquering
troops
entered
vicksburg
they
found
armstrong
guns
from
england
in
position
and
so
on
every
field
where
our
patriot
breathed
a
last
breath
were
english
arms
and
munitions
of
war
all
testifying
against
england
the
dead
spoke
also
and
the
wounded
still
speak
reparation
from
england
at
last
the
rebellion
succumbed
british
ships
and
british
supplies
had
done
their
work
but
they
failed
and
now
the
day
of
reckoning
has
come
but
with
little
apparent
sense
of
what
is
due
on
the
part
of
england
without
one
soothing
word
for
a
friendly
power
deeply
aggrieved
without
a
single
regret
for
what
cobden
in
the
house
of
commons
called
cruel
inflicted
upon
us
or
for
what
mr
bright
called
and
comfort
to
the
foulest
of
all
crimes
or
for
what
a
generous
voice
from
oxford
university
denounced
as
a
and
maddening
wrong
england
simply
proposes
to
submit
the
question
of
liability
for
individual
losses
to
an
anomalous
tribunal
where
chance
plays
its
part
this
is
all
nothing
is
admitted
even
on
this
question
no
rule
for
the
future
is
established
while
nothing
is
said
of
the
indignity
to
the
nation
nor
of
the
damages
to
the
nation
on
an
earlier
occasion
it
was
otherwise
there
is
an
unhappy
incident
in
our
relations
with
great
britain
which
attests
how
in
other
days
individual
losses
were
only
a
minor
element
in
reparation
for
a
wrong
received
by
the
nation
you
all
know
from
history
how
in
time
of
profound
peace
and
only
a
few
miles
outside
the
virginia
capes
the
british
frigate
leopard
fired
into
the
national
frigate
chesapeake
pouring
broadside
upon
broadside
killing
three
persons
and
wounding
eighteen
some
severely
and
then
boarding
her
carried
off
four
others
as
british
subjects
this
was
in
the
summer
of
the
brilliant
canning
british
minister
of
foreign
affairs
promptly
volunteered
overtures
for
an
accommodation
by
declaring
his
readiness
to
take
the
whole
of
the
circumstances
of
the
case
into
consideration
and
make
reparation
for
alleged
injury
to
the
sovereignty
of
the
united
whenever
it
should
be
clearly
shown
that
such
injury
has
been
actually
sustained
and
that
such
reparation
is
really
here
was
a
good
beginning
there
was
to
be
reparation
for
an
injury
to
the
national
sovereignty
after
years
of
painful
negotiation
the
british
minister
at
washington
under
date
of
november
offered
to
the
united
states
three
propositions
first
the
disavowal
of
the
unauthorized
act
secondly
the
immediate
restoration
so
far
as
circumstances
would
permit
of
the
men
forcibly
taken
from
the
chesapeake
and
thirdly
a
suitable
pecuniary
provision
for
the
sufferers
in
consequence
of
the
attack
on
the
chesapeake
concluding
with
these
words
honorable
propositions
are
made
with
the
sincere
desire
that
they
may
prove
satisfactory
to
the
government
of
the
united
states
and
i
trust
they
will
meet
with
that
amicable
reception
which
their
conciliatory
nature
entitles
them
to
i
need
scarcely
add
how
cordially
i
join
with
you
in
the
wish
that
they
might
prove
introductory
to
a
removal
of
all
the
differences
depending
between
our
two
i
adduce
this
historic
instance
to
illustrate
partly
the
different
forms
of
reparation
here
of
course
was
reparation
to
individuals
but
there
was
also
reparation
to
the
nation
whose
sovereignty
had
been
outraged
there
is
another
instance
which
is
not
without
authority
in
an
armed
force
from
upper
canada
crossed
the
river
just
above
the
falls
of
niagara
and
burned
an
american
vessel
the
caroline
while
moored
to
the
shores
of
the
united
states
webster
in
his
negotiation
with
lord
ashburton
characterized
this
act
as
itself
a
wrong
and
an
offence
to
the
sovereignty
and
the
dignity
of
the
united
states
for
which
to
this
day
no
atonement
or
even
apology
has
been
made
by
her
government
all
these
words
being
strictly
applicable
to
the
present
case
lord
ashburton
in
reply
after
recapitulating
some
mitigating
circumstances
and
expressing
a
regret
some
explanation
and
apology
for
this
occurrence
was
not
immediately
made
proceeds
to
say
government
earnestly
desire
that
a
reciprocal
respect
for
the
independent
jurisdiction
and
authority
of
neighboring
states
may
be
considered
among
the
first
duties
of
all
governments
and
i
have
to
repeat
the
assurance
of
regret
they
feel
that
the
event
of
which
i
am
treating
should
have
disturbed
the
harmony
they
so
anxiously
wish
to
maintain
with
the
american
people
and
here
again
was
reparation
for
a
wrong
done
to
the
nation
looking
at
what
is
due
to
us
on
the
present
occasion
we
are
brought
again
to
the
conclusion
that
the
satisfaction
of
individuals
whose
ships
have
been
burnt
or
sunk
is
only
a
small
part
of
what
we
may
justly
expect
as
in
the
earlier
cases
where
the
national
sovereignty
was
insulted
there
should
be
an
acknowledgment
of
wrong
or
at
least
of
liability
leaving
to
the
commissioners
the
assessment
of
damages
only
the
blow
inflicted
by
that
fatal
proclamation
which
insulted
our
national
sovereignty
and
struck
at
our
unity
as
a
nation
followed
by
broadside
upon
broadside
driving
our
commerce
from
the
ocean
was
kindred
in
character
to
those
earlier
blows
and
when
we
consider
that
it
was
in
aid
of
slavery
it
was
a
blow
at
civilization
itself
besides
degrading
us
and
ruining
our
commerce
its
direct
and
constant
influence
was
to
encourage
the
rebellion
and
to
prolong
the
war
waged
by
slaveholders
at
such
cost
of
treasure
and
blood
it
was
a
terrible
mistake
which
i
can
not
doubt
that
good
englishmen
must
regret
and
now
in
the
interest
of
peace
it
is
the
duty
of
both
sides
to
find
a
remedy
complete
just
and
conciliatory
so
that
the
deep
sense
of
wrong
and
the
detriment
to
the
republic
may
be
forgotten
in
that
proper
satisfaction
which
a
nation
loving
justice
can
not
hesitate
to
offer
the
extent
of
our
losses
may
be
estimated
with
reasonable
accuracy
ships
burnt
or
sunk
with
their
cargoes
may
be
counted
and
their
value
determined
but
this
leaves
without
recognition
the
vaster
damage
to
commerce
driven
from
the
ocean
and
that
other
damage
immense
and
infinite
caused
by
the
prolongation
of
the
war
all
of
which
may
be
called
in
contradistinction
to
our
have
been
frankly
conceded
by
eminent
englishmen
i
have
already
quoted
cobden
who
did
not
hesitate
to
call
them
during
the
same
debate
in
which
he
let
drop
this
testimony
he
used
other
words
which
show
how
justly
he
comprehended
the
case
have
said
he
on
hostilities
from
these
shores
against
the
people
of
the
united
and
have
been
inflicting
an
amount
of
damage
on
that
country
greater
than
would
be
produced
by
many
ordinary
wars
it
is
estimated
that
the
loss
sustained
by
the
capture
and
burning
of
american
vessels
has
been
about
or
nearly
sterling
that
is
a
small
part
of
the
injury
which
has
been
inflicted
on
the
american
we
have
rendered
the
rest
of
her
vast
mercantile
property
for
the
present
thus
by
the
testimony
of
cobden
were
those
individual
losses
which
are
alone
recognized
by
the
pending
treaty
only
small
part
of
the
injury
after
confessing
his
fears
with
regard
to
heaping
up
of
a
material
such
as
was
then
accumulating
he
adds
in
memorable
words
have
already
done
your
worst
towards
the
american
mercantile
marine
what
with
the
high
rate
of
insurance
what
with
these
captures
and
what
with
the
rapid
transfer
of
tonnage
to
british
capitalists
you
have
virtually
made
valueless
that
vast
property
why
if
you
had
gone
and
helped
the
confederates
by
bombarding
all
the
accessible
seaport
towns
of
america
a
few
lives
might
have
been
lost
which
as
it
is
have
not
been
sacrificed
but
you
could
hardly
have
done
more
injury
in
the
way
of
destroying
property
than
you
have
done
by
these
few
with
that
clearness
of
vision
which
he
possessed
in
such
rare
degree
this
statesman
saw
that
england
had
made
valueless
a
vast
property
as
much
as
if
this
power
had
all
the
accessible
seaport
towns
of
so
strong
and
complete
is
this
statement
that
any
further
citation
seems
superfluous
but
i
can
not
forbear
adducing
a
pointed
remark
in
the
same
debate
by
that
able
gentleman
william
forster
could
not
said
he
a
stronger
illustration
of
the
damage
which
had
been
done
to
the
american
trade
by
these
cruisers
than
the
fact
that
so
completely
was
the
american
flag
driven
from
the
ocean
the
georgia
on
her
second
cruise
did
not
meet
a
single
american
vessel
in
six
weeks
though
she
saw
no
less
than
seventy
vessels
in
a
very
few
this
is
most
suggestive
so
entirely
was
our
commerce
driven
from
the
ocean
that
for
six
weeks
not
an
american
vessel
was
seen
another
englishman
in
an
elaborate
pamphlet
bears
similar
testimony
i
refer
to
the
pamphlet
of
mr
edge
published
in
london
by
ridgway
in
and
entitled
destruction
of
the
american
after
setting
forth
at
length
the
destruction
of
our
commerce
by
british
pirates
this
writer
thus
foreshadows
the
damages
we
says
he
sufferers
we
should
certainly
demand
compensation
for
the
loss
of
the
property
captured
or
destroyed
for
the
interest
of
the
capital
invested
in
the
vessels
and
their
cargoes
and
maybe
a
fair
compensation
in
addition
for
all
and
any
injury
accruing
to
our
business
interests
from
the
depredations
upon
our
shipping
remuneration
may
reach
a
high
figure
in
the
present
case
but
it
would
be
a
simple
act
of
and
might
prevent
an
incomparably
greater
loss
in
the
here
we
have
the
damages
assessed
by
an
englishman
who
while
contemplating
remuneration
at
a
high
figure
recognizes
it
as
simple
act
of
such
is
the
candid
and
explicit
testimony
of
englishmen
pointing
the
way
to
the
proper
rule
of
damages
how
to
authenticate
the
extent
of
national
loss
with
reasonable
certainty
is
not
without
difficulty
but
it
can
not
be
doubted
that
such
a
loss
occurred
it
is
folly
to
question
it
the
loss
may
be
seen
in
various
circumstances
as
in
the
rise
of
insurance
on
all
american
vessels
the
fate
of
the
which
was
one
of
the
great
resources
of
our
country
the
diminution
of
our
tonnage
with
the
corresponding
increase
of
british
tonnage
the
falling
off
in
our
exports
and
imports
with
due
allowance
for
our
abnormal
currency
and
the
diversion
of
war
these
are
some
of
the
elements
and
here
again
we
have
british
testimony
forster
in
the
speech
already
quoted
announces
that
of
the
united
states
was
transferred
to
british
and
cobden
with
his
characteristic
mastery
of
details
shows
that
according
to
an
official
document
laid
on
the
table
of
parliament
american
shipping
had
been
transferred
to
english
capitalists
as
follows
in
vessels
tons
vessels
tons
vessels
tons
vessels
tons
vessels
tons
and
vessels
tons
and
he
adds
am
told
that
this
operation
is
now
going
on
as
fast
as
and
this
circumstance
he
declares
to
be
serious
of
the
question
of
our
relations
with
but
this
serious
is
left
untouched
by
the
pending
treaty
our
own
official
documents
are
in
harmony
with
these
english
authorities
for
instance
i
have
before
me
now
the
report
of
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
for
with
an
appendix
by
nimmo
on
shipbuilding
in
our
country
from
this
report
it
appears
that
in
the
new
england
states
during
the
year
the
most
prosperous
year
of
american
shipbuilding
ships
and
barks
and
schooners
were
built
with
an
aggregate
tonnage
of
tons
while
during
the
last
year
only
ships
and
barks
and
schooners
were
built
with
an
aggregate
tonnage
of
tons
i
add
a
further
statement
from
the
same
report
the
ten
years
from
to
the
aggregate
tonnage
of
american
vessels
entered
at
seaports
of
the
united
states
from
foreign
countries
was
tons
and
the
aggregate
tonnage
of
foreign
vessels
entered
was
tons
while
during
the
five
years
from
to
the
aggregate
tonnage
of
american
vessels
entered
was
tons
and
the
aggregate
tonnage
of
foreign
vessels
entered
was
tons
showing
that
american
tonnage
in
our
foreign
trade
had
fallen
from
two
hundred
and
five
to
per
cent
of
foreign
tonnage
in
the
same
trade
stated
in
other
terms
during
the
decade
from
to
per
cent
of
the
total
tonnage
entered
from
foreign
countries
was
in
american
vessels
and
during
the
five
years
from
to
only
per
cent
of
the
aggregate
tonnage
entered
from
foreign
countries
was
in
american
vessels
a
relative
falling
off
of
nearly
one
it
is
not
easy
to
say
how
much
of
this
change
which
has
become
chronic
may
be
referred
to
british
pirates
but
it
can
not
be
doubted
that
they
contributed
largely
to
produce
it
they
began
the
influences
under
which
this
change
has
continued
there
is
another
document
which
bears
directly
upon
the
present
question
i
refer
to
the
interesting
report
of
morse
our
consul
at
london
made
during
the
last
year
and
published
by
the
secretary
of
state
after
a
minute
inquiry
the
report
shows
that
on
the
breaking
out
of
the
rebellion
in
the
entire
tonnage
of
the
united
states
coasting
and
registered
was
tons
of
which
tons
were
registered
and
employed
in
foreign
trade
and
that
at
the
close
of
the
rebellion
in
notwithstanding
an
increase
in
coasting
tonnage
our
registered
tonnage
had
fallen
to
tons
being
a
loss
during
the
four
years
of
more
than
a
million
tons
amounting
to
about
forty
per
cent
of
our
foreign
commerce
during
the
same
four
years
the
total
tonnage
of
the
british
empire
rose
from
tons
to
tons
the
increase
being
especially
in
the
foreign
trade
the
report
proceeds
to
say
that
as
to
the
cause
of
the
decrease
in
america
and
the
corresponding
increase
in
the
british
empire
can
be
no
room
for
question
or
here
is
the
precise
testimony
from
one
who
at
his
official
post
in
london
watched
this
unprecedented
drama
with
the
outstretched
ocean
as
a
theatre
and
british
pirates
as
the
performers
to
the
rebels
the
belligerent
rights
of
the
sea
when
they
had
not
a
solitary
afloat
in
dock
or
in
the
process
of
construction
and
when
they
had
no
power
to
protect
or
dispose
of
prizes
made
their
when
they
appeared
the
instruments
of
terror
and
destruction
to
our
commerce
from
the
appearance
of
the
first
corsair
in
pursuit
of
their
ships
american
merchants
had
to
pay
not
only
the
marine
but
the
war
risk
also
on
their
ships
after
the
burning
of
one
or
two
ships
with
their
neutral
cargoes
the
had
to
pay
the
war
risk
on
the
cargo
his
ship
had
on
freight
as
well
as
on
the
ship
even
then
for
safety
the
preference
was
as
a
matter
of
course
always
given
to
neutral
vessels
and
american
ships
could
rarely
find
employment
on
these
hard
terms
as
long
as
there
were
good
neutral
ships
in
the
freight
markets
under
such
circumstances
there
was
no
course
left
for
our
merchant
but
to
take
such
profitless
business
as
was
occasionally
offered
them
let
their
ships
lie
idle
at
their
moorings
or
in
dock
with
large
expense
and
deterioration
constantly
going
on
to
sell
them
outright
when
they
could
do
so
without
ruinous
sacrifice
or
put
them
under
foreign
flags
for
beyond
the
actual
loss
in
the
national
tonnage
there
was
a
further
loss
in
the
arrest
of
our
natural
increase
in
this
branch
of
industry
which
an
intelligent
statistician
puts
at
five
per
cent
annually
making
in
a
total
loss
on
this
account
of
tons
which
must
be
added
to
tons
actually
lost
the
same
statistician
after
estimating
the
value
of
a
ton
at
forty
dollars
gold
and
making
allowance
for
old
and
new
ships
puts
the
of
national
loss
on
this
account
at
of
course
this
is
only
an
item
in
our
bill
to
these
authorities
i
add
that
of
the
national
board
of
trade
which
in
a
recent
report
on
american
shipping
after
setting
forth
the
diminution
of
our
sailing
tonnage
says
that
it
is
nearly
all
to
be
traced
to
the
war
on
the
ocean
and
the
result
is
summed
up
in
the
words
that
the
tonnage
of
the
nation
was
rapidly
disappearing
the
ravages
of
the
rebel
and
by
sales
abroad
in
addition
to
the
usual
loss
by
the
perils
of
the
sea
there
was
no
construction
of
new
vessels
going
forward
to
counteract
the
decline
even
in
such
is
the
various
testimony
all
tending
to
one
conclusion
this
is
what
i
have
to
say
for
the
present
on
through
the
destruction
of
commerce
these
are
large
enough
but
there
is
another
chapter
where
they
are
larger
far
i
refer
of
course
to
the
national
losses
caused
by
the
prolongation
of
the
war
and
traceable
directly
to
england
pardon
me
if
i
confess
the
regret
with
which
i
touch
this
prodigious
item
for
i
know
well
the
depth
of
feeling
which
it
is
calculated
to
stir
but
i
can
not
hesitate
it
belongs
to
the
case
no
candid
person
who
studies
this
eventful
period
can
doubt
that
the
rebellion
was
originally
encouraged
by
hope
of
support
from
england
that
it
was
strengthened
at
once
by
the
concession
of
belligerent
rights
on
the
ocean
that
it
was
fed
to
the
end
by
british
supplies
that
it
was
encouraged
by
every
british
ship
that
was
able
to
defy
our
blockade
that
it
was
quickened
into
frantic
life
with
every
report
from
the
british
pirates
flaming
anew
with
every
burning
ship
nor
can
it
be
doubted
that
without
british
intervention
the
rebellion
would
have
soon
succumbed
under
the
efforts
of
the
national
government
not
weeks
or
months
but
years
were
added
in
this
way
to
our
war
so
full
of
costly
sacrifice
the
subsidies
which
in
other
times
england
contributed
to
continental
wars
were
less
effective
than
the
aid
and
comfort
which
she
contributed
to
the
rebellion
it
can
not
be
said
too
often
that
the
of
the
rebellion
was
not
in
america
but
in
england
the
and
the
pirate
ships
were
all
english
england
was
the
fruitful
parent
and
these
were
the
pictured
by
milton
in
his
description
of
sin
which
they
list
would
creep
into
her
womb
and
kennel
cobden
boldly
said
in
the
house
of
commons
that
england
made
war
from
her
shores
on
the
united
states
with
amount
of
damage
to
that
country
greater
than
would
be
produced
by
many
ordinary
according
to
this
testimony
the
conduct
of
england
was
war
but
it
must
not
be
forgotten
that
this
war
was
carried
on
at
our
sole
cost
the
united
states
paid
for
a
war
waged
by
england
upon
the
national
unity
there
was
one
form
that
this
war
assumed
which
was
incessant
most
vexatious
and
costly
besides
being
in
itself
a
positive
alliance
with
the
rebellion
it
was
that
of
openly
equipped
and
supplied
by
england
under
the
shelter
of
that
baleful
proclamation
constantly
leaving
english
ports
they
stole
across
the
ocean
and
then
broke
the
blockade
these
active
agents
of
the
rebellion
could
be
counteracted
only
by
a
network
of
vessels
stretching
along
the
coast
at
great
cost
to
the
country
here
is
another
distinct
item
the
amount
of
which
may
be
determined
at
the
navy
department
the
sacrifice
of
precious
life
is
beyond
human
compensation
but
there
may
be
an
approximate
estimate
of
the
national
loss
in
treasure
everybody
can
make
the
calculation
i
content
myself
with
calling
attention
to
the
elements
which
enter
into
it
besides
the
blockade
there
was
the
prolongation
of
the
war
the
rebellion
was
suppressed
at
a
cost
of
more
than
four
thousand
million
dollars
a
considerable
portion
of
which
has
been
already
paid
leaving
hundred
millions
as
a
national
debt
to
burden
the
people
if
through
british
intervention
the
war
was
doubled
in
duration
or
in
any
way
extended
as
can
not
be
doubted
then
is
england
justly
responsible
for
the
additional
expenditure
to
which
our
country
was
doomed
and
whatever
may
be
the
final
settlement
of
these
great
accounts
such
must
be
the
judgment
in
any
chancery
which
consults
the
simple
equity
of
the
case
this
plain
statement
without
one
word
of
exaggeration
or
aggravation
is
enough
to
exhibit
the
magnitude
of
the
national
losses
whether
from
the
destruction
of
our
commerce
the
prolongation
of
the
war
or
the
expense
of
the
blockade
they
stand
before
us
with
a
base
broad
as
the
nation
and
a
mass
stupendous
as
the
rebellion
itself
it
will
be
for
a
wise
statesmanship
to
determine
how
this
fearful
accumulation
like
ossa
upon
pelion
shall
be
removed
out
of
sight
so
that
it
shall
no
longer
overshadow
the
two
countries
the
rule
of
damages
perhaps
i
ought
to
anticipate
an
objection
from
the
other
side
to
the
effect
that
these
national
losses
whether
from
the
destruction
of
our
commerce
the
prolongation
of
the
war
or
the
expense
of
the
blockade
are
indirect
and
remote
so
as
not
to
be
a
just
ground
of
claim
this
is
expressed
at
the
common
law
by
the
rule
that
must
be
for
the
natural
and
proximate
consequence
of
an
to
this
excuse
the
answer
is
explicit
the
damages
suffered
by
the
united
states
are
twofold
individual
and
national
being
in
each
case
direct
and
proximate
although
in
the
one
case
individuals
suffered
and
in
the
other
case
the
nation
it
is
easy
to
see
that
there
may
be
occasions
where
overtopping
all
individual
damages
are
damages
suffered
by
the
nation
so
that
reparation
to
individuals
would
be
insufficient
nor
can
the
claim
of
the
nation
be
questioned
simply
because
it
is
large
or
because
the
evidence
with
regard
to
it
is
different
from
that
in
the
case
of
an
individual
in
each
case
the
damage
must
be
proved
by
the
best
possible
evidence
and
this
is
all
that
law
or
reason
can
require
in
the
case
of
the
nation
the
evidence
is
historic
and
this
is
enough
impartial
history
will
record
the
national
losses
from
british
intervention
and
it
is
only
reasonable
that
the
evidence
of
these
losses
should
not
be
excluded
from
judgment
because
the
case
is
without
precedent
because
no
nation
ever
before
received
such
injury
from
a
friendly
power
this
can
be
no
reason
why
the
question
should
not
be
considered
on
the
evidence
even
the
rule
of
the
common
law
furnishes
no
impediment
for
our
damages
are
the
natural
consequence
of
what
was
done
but
the
rule
of
the
roman
law
which
is
the
rule
of
international
law
is
broader
than
that
of
the
common
law
the
measure
of
damages
according
to
the
digest
is
may
have
been
lost
or
might
have
been
gained
mihi
abest
quantumque
lucrari
and
this
same
rule
seems
to
prevail
in
the
french
law
borrowed
from
the
roman
law
this
rule
opens
the
door
to
ample
reparation
for
all
damages
whether
individual
or
national
there
is
another
rule
of
the
common
law
in
harmony
with
strict
justice
which
is
applicable
in
the
case
i
find
it
in
the
law
relating
to
which
provides
that
there
may
be
two
distinct
proceedings
first
in
behalf
of
individuals
and
secondly
in
behalf
of
the
community
obviously
reparation
to
individuals
does
not
supersede
reparation
to
the
community
the
proceeding
in
the
one
case
is
by
action
at
law
and
in
the
other
by
indictment
the
reason
assigned
by
blackstone
for
the
latter
is
the
damage
being
common
to
all
the
subjects
no
one
can
assign
his
particular
proportion
of
but
this
is
the
very
case
with
regard
to
damages
sustained
by
the
nation
a
familiar
authority
furnishes
an
additional
illustration
which
is
precisely
in
point
person
natural
or
corporate
can
have
an
action
for
a
or
punish
it
but
only
the
king
in
his
public
capacity
of
supreme
governor
and
of
the
kingdom
yet
this
rule
admits
of
one
exception
where
a
private
person
suffers
some
extraordinary
damage
beyond
the
rest
of
the
applying
this
rule
to
the
present
case
the
way
is
clear
every
british
pirate
was
public
involving
the
british
government
which
must
respond
in
damages
not
only
to
the
individuals
who
have
suffered
but
also
to
the
national
government
acting
as
for
the
common
good
of
all
the
people
thus
by
an
analogy
of
the
common
law
in
the
case
of
a
public
nuisance
also
by
the
strict
rule
of
the
roman
law
which
enters
so
largely
into
international
law
and
even
by
the
rule
of
the
common
law
relating
to
damages
all
losses
whether
individual
or
national
are
the
just
subject
of
claim
it
is
not
i
who
say
this
it
is
the
law
the
colossal
may
be
seen
not
only
in
the
losses
of
individuals
but
in
those
national
losses
caused
by
the
destruction
of
our
commerce
the
prolongation
of
the
war
and
the
expense
of
the
blockade
all
of
which
may
be
charged
directly
to
england
ab
uno
corpore
et
ex
una
pendebat
origine
three
times
is
this
liability
fixed
first
by
the
concession
of
ocean
belligerency
opening
to
the
rebels
foundries
and
manufactories
and
giving
to
them
a
flag
on
the
ocean
secondly
by
the
organization
of
hostile
expeditions
which
by
admissions
in
parliament
were
nothing
less
than
piratical
war
on
the
united
states
with
england
as
the
naval
base
and
thirdly
by
welcome
hospitality
and
supplies
extended
to
these
pirate
ships
in
ports
of
the
british
empire
show
either
of
these
and
the
liability
of
england
is
complete
show
the
three
and
this
power
is
bound
by
a
triple
cord
conclusion
president
in
concluding
these
remarks
i
desire
to
say
that
i
am
no
volunteer
for
several
years
i
have
carefully
avoided
saying
anything
on
this
most
irritating
question
being
anxious
that
negotiations
should
be
left
undisturbed
to
secure
a
settlement
which
could
be
accepted
by
a
deeply
injured
nation
the
submission
of
the
pending
treaty
to
the
judgment
of
the
senate
left
me
no
alternative
it
became
my
duty
to
consider
it
carefully
in
committee
and
to
review
the
whole
subject
if
i
failed
to
find
what
we
had
a
right
to
expect
and
if
the
just
claims
of
our
country
assumed
unexpected
proportions
it
was
not
because
i
would
bear
hard
on
england
but
because
i
wish
most
sincerely
to
remove
all
possibility
of
strife
between
our
two
countries
and
it
is
evident
that
this
can
be
done
only
by
first
ascertaining
the
nature
and
extent
of
difference
in
this
spirit
i
have
spoken
if
the
case
against
england
is
strong
and
if
our
claims
are
unprecedented
in
magnitude
it
is
only
because
the
conduct
of
this
power
at
a
trying
period
was
most
unfriendly
and
the
injurious
consequences
of
this
conduct
were
on
a
scale
corresponding
to
the
theatre
of
action
life
and
property
were
both
swallowed
up
leaving
behind
a
sense
of
enormous
wrong
as
yet
unatoned
and
even
unacknowledged
which
is
one
of
the
chief
factors
in
the
problem
now
presented
to
the
statesmen
of
both
countries
the
attempt
to
close
this
great
international
debate
without
a
complete
settlement
is
little
short
of
puerile
with
the
lapse
of
time
and
with
minuter
consideration
the
case
against
england
becomes
more
grave
not
only
from
the
questions
of
international
responsibility
which
it
involves
but
from
better
comprehension
of
the
damages
which
are
seen
now
in
their
true
proportions
during
the
war
and
for
some
time
thereafter
it
was
impossible
to
state
them
the
mass
of
a
mountain
can
not
be
measured
at
its
base
the
observer
must
occupy
a
certain
distance
and
this
rule
of
perspective
is
justly
applicable
to
damages
which
are
vast
beyond
precedent
a
few
dates
will
show
the
progress
of
the
controversy
and
how
the
case
enlarged
going
as
far
back
as
november
we
find
our
minister
in
london
adams
calling
for
redress
from
the
british
government
on
account
of
the
alabama
this
was
the
mild
beginning
on
the
october
in
another
communication
the
same
minister
suggested
to
the
british
government
any
and
equitable
form
of
conventional
arbitrament
or
this
proposition
slumbered
in
the
british
foreign
office
for
nearly
two
years
during
which
the
alabama
was
pursuing
her
piratical
career
when
on
the
august
it
was
awakened
by
lord
russell
only
to
be
knocked
down
in
these
words
your
letter
of
the
of
october
you
were
pleased
to
say
that
the
government
of
the
united
states
is
ready
to
agree
to
any
form
of
her
government
must
therefore
decline
either
to
make
reparation
and
compensation
for
the
captures
made
by
the
alabama
or
to
refer
the
question
to
any
foreign
such
was
our
repulse
from
england
having
at
least
the
merit
of
frankness
if
nothing
else
on
the
october
our
minister
informed
lord
russell
that
the
united
states
had
finally
resolved
to
make
no
effort
for
arbitration
again
the
whole
question
slumbered
until
august
when
seward
presented
a
list
of
individual
claims
on
account
of
the
pirate
alabama
and
other
rebel
cruisers
from
that
time
negotiation
has
continued
with
ups
and
downs
until
at
last
the
pending
treaty
was
signed
had
the
early
overtures
of
our
government
been
promptly
accepted
or
had
there
been
at
any
time
a
just
recognition
of
the
wrong
done
i
doubt
not
that
this
great
question
would
have
been
settled
but
the
rejection
of
our
very
moderate
propositions
and
the
protracted
delay
which
afforded
an
opportunity
to
review
the
case
in
its
different
bearings
have
awakened
the
people
to
the
magnitude
of
the
interests
involved
if
our
demands
are
larger
now
than
at
our
first
call
it
is
not
the
only
time
in
history
when
such
a
rise
has
occurred
the
story
of
the
sibyl
is
repeated
and
england
is
the
roman
king
shall
these
claims
be
liquidated
and
cancelled
promptly
or
allowed
to
slumber
until
called
into
activity
by
some
future
exigency
there
are
many
among
us
who
taking
counsel
of
a
sense
of
national
wrong
would
leave
them
to
rest
without
settlement
so
as
to
furnish
a
precedent
for
retaliation
in
kind
should
england
find
herself
at
war
there
are
many
in
england
who
taking
counsel
of
a
perverse
political
bigotry
have
spurned
them
absolutely
and
there
are
others
who
invoking
the
point
of
honor
assert
that
england
can
not
entertain
them
without
compromising
her
honor
thus
there
is
peril
from
both
sides
it
is
not
difficult
to
imagine
one
of
our
countrymen
saying
with
jew
villany
you
teach
me
i
will
execute
and
it
shall
go
hard
but
i
will
better
the
nor
is
it
difficult
to
imagine
an
englishman
firm
in
his
conceit
that
no
apology
can
be
made
and
nothing
paid
i
can
not
sympathize
with
either
side
be
the
claims
more
or
less
they
are
honestly
presented
with
the
conviction
that
they
are
just
and
they
should
be
considered
candidly
so
that
they
shall
no
longer
lower
like
a
cloud
ready
to
burst
upon
two
nations
which
according
to
their
inclinations
can
do
each
other
such
infinite
injury
or
such
infinite
good
i
know
it
is
sometimes
said
that
war
between
us
must
come
sooner
or
later
i
do
not
believe
it
but
if
it
must
come
let
it
be
later
and
then
i
am
sure
it
will
never
come
meanwhile
good
men
must
unite
to
make
it
impossible
again
i
say
this
debate
is
not
of
my
seeking
it
is
not
tempting
for
it
compels
criticism
of
a
foreign
power
with
which
i
would
have
more
than
peace
more
even
than
concord
but
it
can
not
be
avoided
the
truth
must
be
told
not
in
anger
but
in
sadness
england
has
done
to
the
united
states
an
injury
most
difficult
to
measure
considering
when
it
was
done
and
in
what
complicity
it
is
truly
unaccountable
at
a
great
epoch
of
history
not
less
momentous
than
that
of
the
french
revolution
or
that
of
the
reformation
when
civilization
was
fighting
a
last
battle
with
slavery
england
gave
her
name
her
influence
her
material
resources
to
the
wicked
cause
and
flung
a
sword
into
the
scale
with
slavery
here
was
a
portentous
mistake
strange
that
the
land
of
wilberforce
after
spending
millions
for
emancipation
after
proclaiming
everywhere
the
truths
of
liberty
and
ascending
to
glorious
primacy
in
the
sublime
movement
for
the
universal
abolition
of
slavery
could
do
this
thing
like
every
departure
from
the
rule
of
justice
and
good
neighborhood
her
conduct
was
pernicious
in
proportion
to
the
scale
of
operations
affecting
individuals
corporations
communities
and
the
nation
itself
and
yet
down
to
this
day
there
is
no
acknowledgment
of
this
wrong
not
a
single
word
such
a
generous
expression
would
be
the
beginning
of
a
just
settlement
and
the
best
assurance
of
that
harmony
between
two
great
and
kindred
nations
which
all
must
desire
locality
in
appointment
to
office
remarks
in
the
senate
april
the
senate
having
under
consideration
a
resolution
requesting
from
the
heads
of
departments
of
the
names
age
and
compensation
of
all
inferior
officers
clerks
and
employés
in
their
respective
departments
at
washington
showing
from
what
states
they
were
respectively
appointed
abbott
of
north
carolina
moved
the
following
addition
that
in
the
opinion
of
the
senate
the
distribution
of
the
official
patronage
of
the
government
not
embraced
in
local
offices
in
the
states
should
be
made
as
nearly
equal
among
all
the
states
according
to
their
representation
and
population
as
may
be
practicable
and
that
to
confine
such
patronage
to
particular
states
or
sections
either
wholly
or
partially
is
both
unjust
and
on
the
latter
resolution
sumner
spoke
as
follows
president
if
i
have
rightly
read
the
history
of
my
country
there
was
before
vicksburg
an
army
commanded
by
three
generals
from
ohio
general
grant
general
sherman
and
general
mcpherson
now
if
i
rightly
understand
the
proposition
of
the
senator
from
north
carolina
he
would
require
that
the
generals
in
command
of
our
army
should
be
taken
geographically
not
according
to
their
merits
not
according
to
their
capacity
to
defend
this
republic
and
to
maintain
with
honor
its
flag
but
simply
according
to
the
place
of
their
residence
and
no
three
generals
should
be
in
command
from
one
state
do
i
understand
the
senator
aright
abbott
my
amendment
reads
far
as
sumner
very
well
far
as
i
would
inquire
of
my
friend
whether
fitness
for
office
or
service
in
other
departments
of
the
government
does
not
depend
upon
capacity
talent
preparation
as
much
as
in
the
army
i
ask
the
senator
if
it
is
not
so
abbott
the
purpose
of
this
amendment
was
not
to
override
all
such
considerations
it
was
to
give
an
expression
of
the
sense
of
the
senate
that
states
should
not
be
ignored
in
the
distribution
of
this
sort
of
patronage
nothing
in
it
prevents
three
generals
from
ohio
being
in
the
command
of
one
army
or
the
appointment
of
three
cabinet
officers
from
ohio
but
it
is
simply
to
express
the
sense
of
the
senate
that
these
things
ought
to
be
done
with
something
like
fairness
and
justice
as
between
the
different
states
sumner
i
take
it
there
is
no
senator
who
does
not
accept
the
general
idea
of
the
senator
from
north
carolina
that
all
things
should
be
done
in
fairness
and
that
all
parts
of
the
country
every
portion
of
this
great
republic
should
be
treated
with
equal
respect
and
honor
that
is
clear
but
first
and
foremost
above
all
is
the
public
service
that
must
be
maintained
it
must
not
be
sacrificed
and
how
can
it
be
maintained
unless
you
advance
to
prominent
posts
in
this
service
those
who
are
the
most
meritorious
and
who
can
best
discharge
the
duties
of
the
post
i
merely
throw
out
this
remark
and
call
attention
to
this
point
that
senators
may
see
to
what
this
proposition
tends
if
it
were
fully
carried
out
it
would
reduce
the
public
service
of
this
country
to
one
dead
level
men
would
go
into
it
merely
because
they
lived
in
certain
places
not
because
they
had
a
fitness
for
the
posts
to
which
they
were
advanced
perhaps
i
am
mistaken
but
i
see
no
reason
why
there
should
be
three
ohio
generals
in
command
before
vicksburg
and
not
three
ohio
citizens
in
eminent
civil
service
to
my
mind
the
attainments
and
the
talents
required
in
civil
service
are
as
well
worthy
to
be
recognized
as
those
that
are
required
in
military
service
and
i
see
no
reason
for
a
rule
that
shall
allow
talent
to
be
taken
without
any
reference
to
geographical
limit
in
the
military
service
which
is
not
equally
applicable
to
the
civil
service
now
as
to
our
friends
who
have
recently
come
into
this
chamber
i
beg
them
to
understand
that
so
far
as
i
am
concerned
there
is
no
disposition
to
deny
or
to
begrudge
them
anything
to
which
according
to
geographical
proportions
they
may
be
entitled
but
i
beg
them
to
consider
that
time
is
an
essential
element
of
this
transition
through
which
we
are
passing
fessenden
will
my
friend
allow
me
to
make
a
suggestion
to
him
sumner
certainly
fessenden
i
merely
wish
to
allude
to
the
notorious
fact
that
for
half
a
century
before
the
rebellion
the
proportion
of
persons
in
civil
office
in
the
departments
in
washington
from
the
southern
states
was
very
nearly
if
not
quite
two
to
one
to
those
from
all
the
other
states
they
had
the
control
and
had
pretty
much
all
the
offices
for
years
and
years
sumner
we
are
now
in
a
process
of
transition
and
i
was
observing
that
time
is
an
essential
element
in
that
process
what
the
senator
from
north
carolina
aims
at
can
not
be
accomplished
at
once
the
change
can
not
be
made
instantly
the
men
are
not
presented
from
the
states
lately
in
rebellion
in
sufficient
numbers
in
sufficient
proportion
with
competency
for
these
posts
i
know
that
there
are
gentlemen
there
fit
to
grace
many
of
these
posts
but
i
know
also
that
there
is
not
relatively
the
same
proportion
of
persons
fit
for
the
civil
service
as
there
is
in
the
other
parts
of
the
country
and
our
friends
from
the
south
it
seems
to
me
must
take
this
into
consideration
kindly
and
wait
yet
a
little
longer
national
affairs
at
home
and
abroad
speech
at
the
republican
state
convention
in
worcester
massachusetts
september
sumner
was
selected
as
president
of
the
convention
on
taking
the
chair
he
spoke
as
follows
of
massachusetts
while
thanking
you
for
the
honor
conferred
upon
me
i
make
haste
to
say
that
in
my
judgment
massachusetts
has
one
duty
at
the
coming
election
to
which
all
local
interests
and
local
questions
must
be
postponed
as
on
its
just
performance
all
else
depends
and
this
commanding
duty
is
to
keep
the
commonwealth
now
as
aforetime
an
example
to
our
country
and
a
bulwark
of
human
rights
such
was
massachusetts
in
those
earlier
days
when
on
the
continent
of
europe
the
name
of
was
given
to
our
countrymen
in
arms
against
the
mother
country
making
this
designation
embrace
all
and
when
in
the
british
parliament
the
great
orator
edmund
burke
exclaimed
cause
of
boston
is
become
the
cause
of
all
america
every
part
of
america
is
united
in
support
of
boston
you
have
made
boston
the
lord
mayor
of
i
quote
these
words
from
the
parliamentary
debates
but
boston
was
at
that
time
massachusetts
and
it
was
her
stand
for
liberty
that
made
her
name
the
synonym
for
all
and
permit
me
to
add
that
in
choosing
a
presiding
officer
entirely
removed
from
local
issues
i
find
assurance
of
your
readiness
to
unite
with
me
in
that
which
concerns
not
massachusetts
only
but
every
part
of
america
and
concerns
also
our
place
and
name
as
a
nation
the
enemy
here
in
massachusetts
would
be
glad
to
divert
attention
from
the
unassailable
principles
of
the
republican
party
they
would
be
glad
to
make
you
forget
that
support
we
owe
to
a
republican
administration
also
that
support
we
owe
to
the
measures
of
reconstruction
and
our
constant
abiding
persistence
for
all
essential
safeguards
not
yet
completely
established
these
they
would
hand
over
to
oblivion
hoping
on
some
local
appeal
to
disorganize
our
forces
or
perhaps
obtain
power
to
be
wielded
against
the
national
cause
massachusetts
can
not
afford
to
occupy
an
uncertain
position
therefore
i
begin
by
asking
you
to
think
of
our
country
our
whole
country
in
other
words
of
affairs
at
home
and
it
is
now
four
years
since
i
had
the
honor
of
presiding
at
our
annual
convention
and
i
do
not
forget
how
at
that
time
i
endeavored
to
remind
you
of
this
same
national
cause
then
in
fearful
peril
the
war
of
armies
was
ended
no
longer
was
arrayed
against
on
each
side
the
trumpet
was
hushed
the
banner
furled
but
the
defection
of
andrew
johnson
had
then
begun
and
out
of
that
defection
the
rebellion
assumed
new
life
with
new
purposes
and
new
hopes
if
it
did
not
spring
forth
once
more
fully
armed
it
did
spring
forth
filled
with
hate
and
diabolism
towards
all
who
loved
the
union
whether
white
or
black
there
were
exceptions
i
know
but
they
were
not
enough
to
change
the
rule
and
straightway
the
new
apparition
acting
in
conjunction
with
the
northern
democracy
aboriginal
allies
of
the
rebellion
planned
the
capture
of
the
national
government
its
representatives
came
up
to
washington
then
was
the
time
for
a
few
decisive
words
in
the
name
of
the
republic
on
which
for
four
years
they
had
waged
bloody
war
the
great
dramatist
who
has
words
for
every
occasion
anticipated
this
when
he
said
thee
therefore
with
a
flood
of
tears
and
wash
away
thy
stained
such
a
mood
would
have
been
the
beginning
of
peace
how
easy
to
see
that
these
men
should
have
been
admonished
frankly
and
kindly
to
return
home
there
to
plant
plough
sow
reap
buy
sell
and
be
prosperous
but
not
to
expect
any
place
in
the
copartnership
of
government
until
there
was
completest
security
for
all
instead
of
this
they
were
sent
back
plotting
how
to
obtain
ascendency
at
home
as
the
to
ascendency
in
the
nation
such
was
the
condition
of
things
in
the
autumn
of
when
sounding
the
alarm
from
this
very
platform
i
insisted
upon
irreversible
guaranties
against
the
rebellion
and
especially
on
security
to
the
national
freedman
and
the
national
creditor
it
was
upon
security
that
i
then
insisted
believing
that
though
the
war
of
armies
was
ended
this
was
a
just
object
of
national
care
all
contained
in
the
famous
postulate
of
war
for
the
without
which
peace
is
no
better
than
armistice
to
that
security
one
thing
is
needed
simply
this
all
men
must
be
safe
in
their
rights
so
that
affairs
whether
of
government
or
business
shall
have
a
free
and
natural
course
but
there
are
two
special
classes
still
in
jeopardy
as
in
the
autumn
of
the
national
freedman
and
the
national
creditor
each
a
creditor
of
the
nation
and
entitled
to
protection
each
under
the
guardianship
of
the
public
faith
and
behind
these
are
faithful
unionists
now
suffering
terribly
from
the
growing
reaction
for
the
protection
of
the
national
freedman
a
constitutional
amendment
is
presented
for
ratification
placing
his
right
to
vote
under
the
perpetual
safeguard
of
the
nation
but
i
am
obliged
to
remind
you
that
this
amendment
has
not
yet
obtained
the
requisite
number
of
states
nor
can
i
say
surely
when
it
will
the
democratic
party
is
arrayed
against
it
and
the
rebel
interest
unites
with
the
democracy
naturally
they
go
together
they
are
old
cronies
here
let
me
say
frankly
that
i
have
never
ceased
to
regret
i
do
now
most
profoundly
regret
that
congress
in
its
plenary
powers
under
the
constitution
especially
in
its
great
unquestionable
power
to
guaranty
a
republican
government
in
the
states
did
not
summarily
settle
this
whole
question
so
that
it
should
no
longer
disturb
the
country
it
was
for
congress
to
fix
the
definition
of
a
republican
government
nor
need
it
go
further
than
our
own
declaration
of
independence
where
is
a
definition
from
which
there
is
no
appeal
there
it
is
as
it
came
from
our
fathers
in
lofty
truth
and
congress
should
have
applied
it
or
it
might
have
gone
to
the
speech
of
abraham
lincoln
at
gettysburg
where
again
is
the
same
great
definition
there
was
also
a
decisive
precedent
as
congress
made
a
civil
rights
law
so
should
it
have
made
a
political
rights
law
in
each
case
the
power
is
identical
if
it
can
be
done
in
the
one
it
can
be
done
in
the
other
to
my
mind
nothing
is
clearer
thus
far
congress
has
thought
otherwise
there
remains
then
the
slow
process
of
constitutional
amendment
to
which
the
country
must
be
rallied
but
this
is
not
enough
no
mere
text
of
constitution
or
law
is
sufficient
behind
these
must
be
a
prevailing
public
opinion
and
a
sympathetic
administration
both
are
needed
the
administration
must
reinforce
public
opinion
and
public
opinion
must
reinforce
the
administration
such
is
all
experience
without
these
the
strongest
text
and
most
cunning
in
its
requirements
is
only
a
phantom
it
may
be
of
terror
as
was
the
case
with
the
fugitive
slave
bill
but
not
a
living
letter
it
is
not
practically
obeyed
sometimes
it
is
evaded
sometimes
openly
set
at
nought
and
now
it
is
my
duty
to
warn
you
that
the
national
freedman
still
needs
your
care
his
ancient
master
is
already
in
the
field
conspiring
against
him
that
traditional
experience
that
infinite
audacity
that
insensibility
to
human
rights
which
so
long
upheld
slavery
are
aroused
anew
no
longer
able
to
hold
him
as
slave
the
ancient
master
means
to
hold
him
as
dependant
and
to
keep
him
in
his
service
personal
and
political
thus
substituting
a
new
bondage
for
the
old
unhappily
he
finds
at
the
north
a
political
party
which
the
rebellion
has
not
weaned
from
that
unnatural
southern
breast
whence
it
drew
its
primitive
nutriment
and
this
political
party
now
fraternizes
in
the
dismal
work
by
which
peace
is
postponed
for
until
the
national
freedman
is
safe
in
equal
rights
there
can
be
no
peace
you
may
call
it
peace
but
i
tell
you
it
is
not
peace
it
is
peace
only
in
name
who
does
not
feel
that
he
treads
still
on
smothered
fires
who
does
not
feel
his
feet
burn
as
he
moves
over
the
treacherous
ashes
if
i
wished
any
new
motive
for
opposition
to
the
democracy
i
should
find
it
in
this
hostile
alliance
because
i
am
for
peace
so
that
this
whole
people
may
be
at
work
because
i
desire
tranquillity
so
that
all
may
be
happy
because
i
seek
reconciliation
so
that
there
shall
be
completest
harmony
therefore
i
oppose
the
democracy
and
now
denounce
it
as
disturber
of
the
national
peace
the
information
from
the
south
is
most
painful
old
rebels
are
crawling
from
to
resume
their
former
rule
and
what
a
rule
such
as
might
be
expected
from
the
representatives
of
slavery
it
is
the
rule
of
misrule
where
the
takes
the
place
of
missionary
and
schoolmaster
murder
is
unloosed
the
national
freedman
is
the
victim
and
so
is
the
unionist
not
one
of
these
states
where
intimidation
with
death
in
its
train
does
not
play
its
part
take
that
whole
southern
tier
from
georgia
to
texas
and
add
to
it
tennessee
and
i
fear
north
carolina
and
virginia
also
for
the
crime
is
contagious
and
there
is
small
justice
for
those
to
whom
you
owe
so
much
that
these
things
should
occur
under
andrew
johnson
was
natural
that
reconstruction
should
encounter
difficulties
after
his
defection
was
natural
andrew
johnson
is
now
out
of
the
way
and
in
his
place
a
patriot
president
public
opinion
must
come
to
his
support
in
this
necessary
work
there
is
but
one
thing
these
disturbers
feel
it
is
power
and
this
they
must
be
made
to
feel
i
mean
the
power
of
an
awakened
people
directed
by
a
republican
administration
vigorously
constantly
surely
so
that
there
shall
be
no
rest
for
the
wicked
if
i
could
forget
the
course
of
the
democracy
on
these
things
as
i
can
not
there
is
still
another
chapter
for
exposure
and
the
more
it
is
seen
the
worse
it
appears
it
is
that
standing
menace
of
repudiation
by
which
the
national
credit
at
home
and
abroad
suffers
so
much
and
our
taxes
are
so
largely
increased
it
will
not
do
to
say
that
no
national
convention
has
yet
announced
this
dishonesty
i
charge
it
upon
the
party
a
party
which
repudiates
the
fundamental
principles
of
the
declaration
of
independence
which
repudiates
equality
before
the
law
which
repudiates
the
truth
that
government
is
founded
only
on
the
consent
of
the
governed
which
repudiates
what
is
most
precious
and
good
in
our
recent
history
and
whose
chiefs
are
now
engaged
in
cunning
assault
upon
the
national
creditor
is
a
party
of
repudiation
this
is
its
just
designation
a
democrat
is
a
repudiator
what
is
slavery
itself
but
an
enormous
wholesale
repudiation
of
all
rights
all
truths
and
all
decencies
how
easy
for
a
party
accepting
this
degradation
to
repudiate
pecuniary
obligations
these
are
small
compared
with
the
other
naturally
the
democracy
is
once
more
in
conjunction
with
the
old
the
repudiation
gospel
according
to
pendleton
is
now
preaching
in
ohio
and
nothing
is
more
certain
than
that
the
triumph
of
the
democracy
would
be
a
fatal
blow
not
only
at
the
national
freedman
but
also
at
the
national
creditor
there
would
be
repudiation
for
each
the
word
in
its
present
sense
is
not
old
it
first
appeared
in
mississippi
a
democratic
state
intensely
devoted
to
slavery
if
the
thing
were
known
before
never
before
did
it
assume
the
same
hardihood
of
name
it
was
in
that
a
mississippi
governor
in
a
message
to
the
legislature
used
this
word
with
regard
to
certain
state
bonds
and
thus
began
that
policy
by
which
mississippi
was
first
dishonored
and
then
kept
poor
for
capital
was
naturally
shy
of
such
a
state
constantly
from
that
time
mississippi
had
this
nor
is
the
state
more
known
as
the
home
of
jefferson
davis
than
as
the
home
of
repudiation
unhappily
the
nation
suffered
also
and
even
now
as
i
understand
it
is
argued
in
europe
to
our
discredit
that
because
mississippi
repudiated
the
nation
may
repudiate
also
if
i
refer
to
this
example
it
is
because
i
would
illustrate
the
mischief
of
the
democratic
policy
and
summon
mississippi
to
tardy
justice
a
regenerated
state
can
not
afford
to
bear
the
burden
of
repudiation
nor
can
the
nation
and
the
sisterhood
of
states
forget
misconduct
so
injurious
to
all
i
have
pleasure
at
this
point
in
reference
to
an
early
effort
in
the
american
review
by
an
able
lawyer
for
a
time
an
ornament
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
hon
curtis
who
after
reviewing
the
misconduct
of
mississippi
argues
most
persuasively
that
where
a
state
repudiates
its
obligations
to
the
detriment
of
foreigners
there
is
a
remedy
through
the
national
government
this
suggestion
is
important
for
mississippi
now
but
the
article
contains
another
warning
applicable
to
the
nation
at
the
present
hour
which
i
quote
conduct
of
a
few
states
has
not
only
destroyed
their
own
credit
and
left
their
sister
states
very
little
to
boast
of
but
has
so
materially
affected
the
credit
of
the
whole
union
that
it
was
found
impossible
to
negotiate
in
europe
any
part
of
the
loan
authorized
by
congress
in
it
was
offered
on
terms
most
advantageous
to
the
creditor
terms
which
in
former
times
would
have
been
eagerly
accepted
and
after
going
through
all
the
exchanges
of
europe
the
agent
gave
up
the
attempt
to
obtain
the
money
in
as
the
fallen
drunkard
illustrates
the
evils
of
intemperance
so
does
mississippi
illustrate
the
evils
of
repudiation
look
at
her
but
there
are
men
who
would
degrade
our
republic
to
this
wretched
condition
forgetting
what
is
due
to
our
good
name
as
a
nation
at
home
and
abroad
forgetting
that
the
public
interests
are
bound
up
with
the
public
faith
involving
all
economies
national
and
individual
forgetting
that
our
transcendent
position
has
corresponding
obligations
and
that
as
nobility
once
obliged
to
great
duty
so
does
republicanism
now
there
are
men
who
forgetting
all
these
things
would
carry
our
republic
into
this
terrible
gulf
so
full
of
shame
and
sacrifice
they
begin
by
subtle
devices
but
already
the
mutterings
of
open
repudiation
are
heard
i
denounce
them
all
whether
device
or
muttering
and
i
denounce
that
political
party
which
lends
itself
to
the
outrage
repudiation
means
confiscation
and
in
the
present
case
confiscation
of
the
property
of
loyal
citizens
with
unparalleled
generosity
the
nation
has
refused
to
confiscate
rebel
property
and
now
it
is
proposed
to
confiscate
loyal
property
when
i
expose
repudiation
as
confiscation
i
mean
to
be
precise
between
two
enactments
one
requiring
the
surrender
of
property
without
compensation
and
the
other
declaring
that
the
nation
shall
not
and
will
not
pay
an
equal
amount
according
to
solemn
promise
there
can
be
no
just
distinction
the
two
are
alike
the
former
might
alarm
a
greater
number
because
on
its
face
more
demonstrative
but
analyze
the
two
and
you
will
see
that
in
each
private
property
is
taken
by
the
nation
without
compensation
and
appropriated
to
its
own
use
therefore
do
i
say
repudiation
is
confiscation
a
favorite
device
of
repudiation
is
to
pay
the
national
debt
in
in
other
words
to
pay
bonds
bearing
interest
with
mere
promises
not
bearing
interest
violating
in
the
first
place
a
rule
of
honesty
which
forbids
such
a
trick
and
in
the
second
place
a
rule
of
law
which
refuses
to
recognize
an
inferior
obligation
as
payment
of
a
superior
here
in
plain
terms
is
repudiation
of
the
interest
and
indefinite
postponement
of
the
principal
this
position
when
first
broached
contemplated
nothing
less
than
an
infinite
issue
of
greenbacks
flooding
the
country
as
france
was
flooded
by
and
utterly
destroying
values
of
all
kinds
although
in
its
present
more
moderate
form
it
is
limited
to
payment
by
existing
greenbacks
yet
it
has
the
same
radical
injustice
bonds
are
to
be
paid
with
bits
of
paper
the
statement
of
the
case
is
enough
its
proposer
would
never
do
this
thing
in
his
own
affairs
but
how
can
he
ask
his
country
to
do
what
honesty
forbids
in
private
life
another
device
is
to
tax
the
bonds
when
the
money
was
lent
on
the
positive
condition
that
the
bonds
should
not
be
taxed
this
of
course
is
to
break
the
contract
in
another
way
it
is
repudiation
in
another
form
to
argue
these
questions
is
happily
unnecessary
and
i
allude
to
them
only
because
i
wish
to
exhibit
the
loss
to
the
country
from
such
attempts
this
can
be
made
plain
as
a
the
total
debt
of
our
country
on
the
september
aside
from
the
sixty
millions
of
bonds
issued
to
the
pacific
railway
was
and
here
i
mention
with
great
satisfaction
that
since
the
march
last
the
debt
has
been
reduced
the
surplus
revenue
now
accruing
is
not
less
than
a
year
and
will
be
probably
not
less
than
a
year
of
which
large
sum
not
less
than
must
be
attributed
to
the
better
enforcement
of
the
laws
and
the
economy
now
prevailing
under
a
republican
administration
and
here
comes
the
practical
point
large
as
is
our
surplus
revenue
it
should
have
been
more
and
would
have
been
more
but
for
the
repudiation
menaced
by
the
democracy
if
we
look
at
our
bonded
debt
we
find
it
is
now
upon
which
we
pay
not
less
than
in
annual
interest
the
larger
part
at
six
per
the
smaller
at
five
per
gold
the
difference
between
this
interest
and
that
paid
by
other
powers
is
the
measure
of
our
annual
loss
english
three
per
cents
and
french
fours
are
firm
in
the
market
but
england
and
france
have
not
the
same
immeasurable
resources
that
are
ours
nor
is
either
so
secure
in
its
government
it
is
easy
to
see
that
our
debt
could
have
been
funded
without
paying
more
than
four
per
but
for
the
doubt
cast
upon
our
credit
by
the
dishonest
schemes
of
repudiation
in
and
of
are
costly
cries
without
these
there
would
have
been
annually
to
swell
our
surplus
revenue
but
this
sum
if
invested
in
a
sinking
fund
at
four
per
cent
interest
would
pay
the
whole
bonded
debt
in
less
than
thirty
years
such
is
our
annual
loss
the
of
this
loss
directly
chargeable
upon
the
repudiators
is
more
than
one
hundred
millions
already
paid
in
taxes
and
much
i
fear
that
before
the
nation
can
recover
from
the
discredit
inflicted
upon
it
another
hundred
millions
will
be
paid
in
the
same
way
it
is
hard
to
see
this
immense
treasure
wrung
by
taxation
from
the
toil
of
the
people
to
pay
these
devices
of
a
dishonest
democracy
do
not
forget
that
the
cost
of
this
experiment
is
confined
to
no
particular
class
wherever
the
goes
there
it
is
paid
every
workman
pays
it
in
his
food
and
clothing
every
mechanic
and
artisan
in
his
tools
every
housewife
in
her
and
every
merchant
in
the
stamp
upon
his
note
every
man
of
salary
in
the
income
tax
ay
every
laborer
in
his
wood
his
coal
his
potatoes
and
his
salt
many
of
these
taxes
imposed
under
duress
of
war
will
be
removed
soon
i
trust
but
still
the
enormous
sum
of
forty
millions
annually
must
be
contributed
by
the
labor
of
the
country
until
the
world
is
convinced
that
in
spite
of
democratic
menace
the
republic
will
maintain
its
plighted
faith
to
the
end
people
wish
to
reduce
taxation
i
tell
you
how
let
no
doubt
rest
upon
the
public
faith
then
will
the
present
burdensome
taxation
grow
by
degrees
and
beautifully
is
the
doubt
which
it
is
with
our
country
as
with
an
individual
the
doubt
obliges
the
payment
of
to
stop
that
extra
interest
we
must
keep
faith
as
we
look
at
the
origin
of
the
greenback
we
shall
find
a
new
motive
for
fidelity
i
do
not
speak
of
that
patriotic
character
which
commends
the
national
debt
but
of
the
financial
principle
on
which
the
greenback
was
first
issued
it
came
from
the
overruling
exigencies
of
the
national
existence
depended
upon
money
which
could
be
had
only
through
a
forced
loan
the
greenback
was
the
agency
by
which
it
was
collected
the
disloyal
party
resisted
the
passage
of
the
original
act
prophesying
danger
and
difficulty
but
the
safety
of
the
nation
required
the
risk
and
the
republican
party
assumed
it
and
now
this
same
disloyal
party
once
against
the
greenback
insist
upon
continuing
in
peace
what
was
justified
only
in
war
insist
upon
a
forced
loan
when
the
overruling
exigencies
of
have
ceased
and
the
nation
is
saved
to
such
absurdity
is
this
party
now
driven
the
case
is
aggravated
when
we
consider
the
boundless
resources
of
the
country
through
which
in
a
short
time
even
this
great
debt
will
be
lightened
if
the
praters
of
repudiation
are
silenced
peace
financially
as
well
as
politically
is
needed
let
us
have
peace
nowhere
will
it
be
felt
more
than
at
the
south
which
is
awakening
to
a
consciousness
of
resources
unknown
while
slavery
ruled
with
these
considerable
additions
to
the
national
capital
five
years
can
not
pass
without
a
sensible
diminution
of
our
burdens
a
rate
of
taxation
equal
to
only
one
half
that
of
will
pay
even
our
present
interest
all
present
expenses
and
the
entire
principal
in
less
than
twenty
years
but
to
this
end
we
must
keep
faith
the
attempt
is
aggravated
still
further
when
it
is
considered
that
repudiation
is
impossible
try
as
you
may
you
can
not
succeed
you
may
cause
incalculable
distress
and
postpone
the
great
day
of
peace
but
you
can
not
do
this
thing
the
national
debt
never
can
be
repudiated
it
will
be
paid
dollar
for
dollar
in
coin
with
interest
to
the
end
how
little
do
these
repudiators
know
the
mighty
resisting
power
which
they
encounter
how
little
the
mighty
crash
which
they
invite
as
well
undertake
to
move
mount
washington
from
its
everlasting
base
or
to
shut
out
the
ocean
from
our
coasts
it
is
needless
to
say
that
the
crash
would
be
in
proportion
to
the
mass
affected
being
nothing
less
than
the
whole
business
of
the
country
now
it
appears
from
investigations
making
at
this
moment
by
commissioner
wells
whose
labors
shed
such
light
on
financial
questions
that
annual
product
reaches
the
sum
of
seven
thousand
millions
of
but
this
prodigious
amount
depends
for
its
value
upon
exchange
which
in
turn
depends
upon
credit
destroy
exchange
and
even
these
untold
resources
would
be
an
infinite
chaos
without
form
and
void
employment
would
cease
capital
would
waste
mills
would
stop
the
rich
would
become
poor
the
poor
i
fear
would
starve
savings
banks
trust
companies
insurance
companies
would
disappear
such
would
be
the
mighty
crash
but
here
you
see
also
the
mighty
resisting
power
therefore
again
do
i
say
repudiation
is
impossible
boutwell
is
criticized
by
the
democracy
because
he
buys
up
bonds
paying
the
current
market
rates
when
he
should
pay
the
face
in
greenbacks
i
refer
to
this
democratic
criticism
because
i
would
show
how
little
its
authors
look
to
consequences
while
forgetting
the
requirements
of
public
faith
suppose
the
secretary
yielding
to
these
wise
suggestions
should
announce
his
purpose
to
take
up
the
first
ten
millions
of
paying
the
face
in
greenbacks
what
then
us
the
deluge
said
the
french
king
and
so
after
such
notice
from
our
secretary
would
our
deluge
begin
at
once
the
entire
bonded
debt
would
be
reduced
to
greenbacks
the
greenback
would
not
be
raised
the
bond
would
be
drawn
down
all
this
at
once
and
in
plain
violation
of
the
solemn
declaration
of
both
houses
of
congress
pledging
payment
in
coin
but
who
can
measure
the
consequences
bonds
would
be
thrown
upon
the
market
from
all
points
of
the
compass
at
home
and
abroad
they
would
come
business
would
be
disorganized
prices
would
be
changed
labor
would
be
crushed
the
fountains
of
the
great
deep
would
be
broken
up
and
the
deluge
would
be
upon
us
among
the
practical
agencies
to
which
the
country
owes
much
already
are
the
national
banks
whatever
may
be
the
differences
of
opinion
with
regard
to
them
they
can
not
fail
to
be
taken
into
account
in
all
financial
discussions
as
they
have
done
good
where
they
are
now
established
i
would
gladly
see
them
extended
especially
at
the
south
and
west
where
they
are
much
needed
and
where
abundant
crops
already
supply
the
capital
it
is
doubtful
if
this
can
be
brought
about
without
removing
the
currency
limitation
in
the
existing
bank
act
in
this
event
i
should
like
the
condition
that
for
every
new
issued
a
greenback
should
be
cancelled
thus
substituting
the
for
the
greenback
in
this
way
greenbacks
would
be
reduced
in
volume
while
currency
is
supplied
by
the
banks
such
diminution
of
the
national
paper
would
be
an
important
stage
toward
specie
payments
while
the
national
banks
in
the
south
and
west
founded
on
the
bonds
of
the
united
states
would
be
a
new
security
for
the
national
credit
in
making
this
suggestion
i
would
not
forget
the
necessity
of
specie
payments
at
the
earliest
possible
moment
nor
can
i
forbear
to
declare
my
unalterable
conviction
that
by
proper
exertion
this
supreme
object
may
be
accomplished
promptly
always
provided
the
national
credit
is
kept
above
suspicion
or
like
the
good
knight
fear
and
without
thus
at
every
turn
are
we
brought
back
to
one
single
point
the
public
faith
which
can
not
be
dishonored
without
infinite
calamity
the
child
is
told
not
to
tell
a
lie
but
this
injunction
is
the
same
for
the
man
and
for
the
nation
also
we
can
not
tell
a
lie
to
the
national
freedman
or
the
national
creditor
we
can
not
tell
a
lie
to
anybody
that
word
of
shame
can
not
be
ours
but
falsehood
to
the
national
freedman
and
the
national
creditor
is
a
national
lie
breaking
promise
with
either
you
are
dishonored
and
must
be
stamped
upon
the
forehead
of
the
nation
beyond
the
ignominy
which
all
of
us
must
bear
will
be
the
influence
of
such
a
transgression
in
discrediting
republican
government
and
the
very
idea
of
a
republic
for
weal
or
woe
we
are
an
example
mankind
is
now
looking
to
us
and
just
in
proportion
to
the
eminence
we
have
reached
is
the
eminence
of
our
example
already
we
have
shown
how
a
republic
can
conquer
in
arms
offering
millions
of
citizens
and
untold
treasure
at
call
it
remains
for
us
to
show
how
a
republic
can
conquer
in
a
field
more
glorious
than
battle
where
all
these
millions
of
citizens
and
all
this
untold
treasure
uphold
the
public
faith
such
an
example
will
elevate
republican
government
and
make
the
idea
of
a
republic
more
than
ever
great
and
splendid
helping
here
you
help
not
only
your
own
country
but
help
humanity
also
help
liberal
institutions
in
all
lands
help
the
everywhere
and
all
who
struggle
against
the
wrong
and
tyranny
of
earth
the
brilliant
frenchman
montesquieu
in
that
remarkable
work
which
occupied
so
much
attention
during
the
last
century
spirit
of
laws
pronounces
the
animating
sentiment
of
monarchy
but
the
animating
sentiment
of
a
republic
it
is
for
us
to
show
that
he
was
right
nor
can
we
depart
from
this
rule
of
virtue
without
disturbing
the
order
of
the
universe
faith
is
nothing
less
than
a
part
of
that
sublime
harmony
by
which
the
planets
wheel
surely
in
their
appointed
orbits
and
nations
are
summoned
to
justice
nothing
too
lofty
for
its
power
nothing
too
lowly
for
its
protection
it
is
an
essential
principle
in
the
divine
cosmos
without
which
confusion
reigns
supreme
all
depends
upon
faith
why
do
you
build
because
you
have
faith
in
those
laws
by
which
you
are
secured
in
person
and
property
why
do
you
plant
why
do
you
sow
because
you
have
faith
in
the
returning
seasons
faith
in
the
generous
skies
faith
in
the
sun
but
faith
in
this
republic
must
be
fixed
as
the
sun
which
illumines
all
i
can
not
be
content
with
less
full
well
i
see
that
every
departure
from
this
great
law
is
only
to
our
ruin
and
from
the
height
we
have
reached
the
tumble
will
be
like
that
of
the
grecian
god
from
the
battlements
of
heaven
morn
to
noon
he
fell
from
noon
to
dewy
eve
a
day
and
with
the
setting
sun
dropped
from
the
zenith
like
a
falling
it
only
remains
come
what
may
that
we
should
at
all
hazards
preserve
this
public
faith
never
forgetting
that
honesty
is
not
only
the
best
policy
but
the
golden
rule
for
myself
i
see
nothing
more
practical
at
this
moment
than
first
at
all
points
to
oppose
the
democracy
and
secondly
to
insist
that
yet
awhile
longer
shall
be
excused
from
copartnership
in
government
do
not
think
me
harsh
do
not
think
me
austere
i
am
not
i
will
not
be
outdone
by
anybody
in
clemency
nor
at
the
proper
time
will
i
be
behind
any
one
in
opening
all
doors
of
office
and
trust
but
the
proper
time
has
not
yet
come
there
must
be
security
for
the
future
unquestionable
and
ample
before
i
am
ready
and
this
i
would
require
not
only
for
the
sake
of
the
national
freedman
and
the
national
creditor
but
for
the
sake
of
the
country
containing
the
interests
of
all
and
also
of
the
himself
whose
truest
welfare
is
in
that
peace
where
all
controversy
shall
be
extinguished
forever
in
this
there
is
nothing
but
equity
and
prudence
according
to
received
precedents
the
ancient
historian
declares
that
the
ancestors
of
rome
the
most
religious
of
men
took
nothing
from
the
vanquished
but
the
license
to
do
wrong
majores
religiosissimi
mortales
neque
victis
quicquam
præter
injuriæ
licentiam
these
are
the
words
of
sallust
i
know
no
better
example
for
our
present
guidance
who
can
object
if
men
recently
arrayed
against
their
country
are
told
to
stand
aside
yet
a
little
longer
until
all
are
secure
in
their
rights
here
is
no
fixed
exclusion
nothing
of
which
there
can
be
any
just
complaint
nothing
which
is
not
practical
wise
humane
nothing
which
is
not
born
of
justice
rather
than
victory
in
the
establishment
of
equal
rights
conquest
loses
its
character
and
is
no
longer
conquest
then
both
parties
nobly
are
subdued
and
neither
party
even
in
the
uncertainty
of
the
future
it
is
easy
to
see
that
the
national
freedman
and
the
national
creditor
have
a
common
fortune
in
the
terrible
furnace
of
war
they
were
joined
together
nor
can
they
be
separated
until
the
rights
of
both
are
fixed
beyond
change
therefore
could
my
voice
reach
them
i
would
say
stand
by
the
creditor
creditor
stand
by
the
freedman
and
to
the
people
i
would
say
by
both
from
affairs
at
home
i
turn
to
affairs
abroad
and
here
i
wish
to
speak
cautiously
in
speaking
at
all
i
break
a
vow
with
myself
not
to
open
my
lips
on
these
questions
except
in
the
senate
i
yield
to
friendly
pressure
and
yet
i
know
no
reason
why
i
should
not
speak
it
was
talleyrand
who
to
somebody
apologizing
for
what
might
be
an
indiscreet
question
replied
that
an
answer
might
be
indiscreet
but
not
a
question
my
answer
shall
at
least
be
frank
in
our
foreign
relations
there
are
with
me
two
cardinal
principles
which
i
have
no
hesitation
to
avow
at
all
times
first
peace
with
all
the
world
and
secondly
sympathy
with
all
struggling
for
human
rights
in
neither
of
these
would
i
fail
for
each
is
essential
peace
is
our
ally
through
peace
the
whole
world
will
be
ours
in
the
right
hand
carry
gentle
peace
and
there
is
nothing
we
can
not
do
filled
with
the
might
of
peace
the
sympathy
we
extend
will
have
a
persuasive
power
following
these
plain
principles
we
should
be
open
so
that
foreign
nations
shall
know
our
sentiments
and
in
such
way
that
even
where
there
is
a
difference
there
shall
be
no
just
cause
for
offence
in
this
spirit
i
would
now
approach
spain
who
can
forget
that
great
historic
monarchy
on
whose
empire
encircling
the
globe
the
sun
never
set
patron
of
that
renowned
navigator
through
whom
she
became
the
discoverer
of
this
hemisphere
her
original
sway
within
it
surpassed
that
of
any
other
power
at
last
her
extended
possessions
on
the
main
won
by
cortés
and
pizarro
loosed
themselves
from
her
grasp
to
take
their
just
place
in
the
family
of
nations
cuba
and
porto
rico
rich
islands
of
the
gulf
remained
and
now
cuban
insurgents
demand
independence
also
for
months
they
have
engaged
in
deadly
conflict
with
the
spanish
power
ravaged
provinces
and
bloodshed
are
the
witnesses
the
beautiful
island
where
sleeps
christopher
columbus
with
the
epitaph
that
he
gave
to
castile
and
leon
a
new
world
is
fast
becoming
a
desert
while
the
nation
to
which
he
gave
the
new
world
is
contending
for
its
last
possession
there
on
this
simple
statement
two
questions
occur
first
as
to
the
duty
of
spain
and
secondly
as
to
the
duty
of
the
united
states
unwelcome
as
it
may
be
to
that
famous
castilian
pride
which
has
played
so
lofty
a
part
in
modern
europe
spain
must
not
refuse
to
see
the
case
in
its
true
light
nor
can
she
close
her
eyes
to
the
lesson
of
history
she
must
recall
how
the
thirteen
american
colonies
achieved
independence
against
all
the
power
of
england
how
all
her
own
colonies
on
the
american
main
achieved
independence
against
her
own
most
strenuous
efforts
how
at
this
moment
england
is
preparing
to
release
her
northern
colonies
from
their
condition
of
dependence
and
recalling
these
examples
it
will
be
proper
for
her
to
consider
if
they
do
not
illustrate
a
tendency
of
all
colonies
which
was
remarked
by
an
illustrious
frenchman
even
before
the
independence
of
the
united
states
never
was
anything
more
prophetic
in
politics
than
when
turgot
in
speaking
of
the
phœnician
colonies
in
greece
and
asia
minor
said
are
like
fruits
which
hold
to
the
tree
only
until
their
maturity
when
sufficient
for
themselves
they
did
that
which
carthage
afterwards
did
which
some
day
america
will
these
most
remarkable
words
of
the
will
be
found
in
his
discourse
at
the
sorbonne
and
now
for
their
application
has
not
cuba
reached
his
condition
of
maturity
is
it
not
sufficient
for
itself
at
all
events
is
victory
over
a
colony
contending
for
independence
worth
the
blood
and
treasure
it
will
cost
these
are
serious
questions
which
can
be
answered
properly
only
by
putting
aside
all
passion
and
prejudice
of
empire
and
calmly
confronting
the
actual
condition
of
things
nor
must
the
case
of
cuba
be
confounded
for
a
moment
with
our
wicked
rebellion
having
for
its
object
the
dismemberment
of
a
republic
to
found
a
new
power
with
slavery
as
its
vaunted
for
myself
i
can
not
doubt
that
in
the
interest
of
both
parties
cuba
and
spain
and
in
the
interest
of
humanity
also
the
contest
should
be
closed
this
is
my
judgment
on
the
facts
so
far
as
known
to
me
cuba
must
be
saved
from
its
bloody
delirium
or
little
will
be
left
for
the
final
conqueror
nor
can
the
enlightened
mind
fail
to
see
that
the
spanish
power
on
this
island
is
an
anachronism
the
day
of
european
colonies
has
passed
at
least
in
this
hemisphere
where
the
rights
of
man
were
first
proclaimed
and
first
organized
a
governor
from
europe
nominated
by
a
crown
is
a
constant
witness
against
these
fundamental
principles
as
the
true
course
of
spain
is
clear
so
to
my
mind
is
the
true
course
of
the
united
states
equally
clear
it
is
to
avoid
involving
ourselves
in
any
way
enough
of
war
have
we
had
without
heedlessly
assuming
another
enough
has
our
commerce
been
driven
from
the
ocean
without
heedlessly
arousing
another
enemy
enough
of
taxation
are
we
compelled
to
bear
without
adding
another
mountain
two
policies
were
open
to
us
at
the
beginning
of
the
insurrection
one
was
to
unite
our
fortunes
with
the
insurgents
assuming
the
responsibilities
of
such
an
alliance
with
the
hazard
of
issued
by
spain
and
of
public
war
i
say
nothing
of
the
certain
consequences
in
expenditure
and
in
damages
a
spanish
would
not
be
less
destructive
than
the
english
alabama
the
other
policy
was
to
make
spain
feel
that
we
wish
her
nothing
but
good
and
that
especially
since
the
expulsion
of
her
royal
dynasty
we
cherish
for
her
a
cordial
and
kindly
sympathy
it
is
said
that
republics
are
ungrateful
but
i
would
not
forget
that
at
the
beginning
of
our
revolutionary
struggle
our
fathers
were
aided
by
her
money
as
afterwards
by
her
arms
and
that
her
great
statesman
florida
blanca
by
his
remarkable
energies
determined
the
organization
of
that
armed
neutrality
in
northern
europe
which
turned
the
scale
against
england
so
that
john
adams
declared
owe
the
blessings
of
peace
to
the
armed
i
say
nothing
of
the
motives
by
which
spain
was
then
governed
it
is
something
that
in
our
day
of
need
she
lent
us
a
helping
hand
it
is
evident
that
adopting
the
first
policy
we
should
be
powerless
except
as
an
enemy
the
second
policy
may
enable
us
to
exercise
an
important
influence
the
more
i
reflect
upon
the
actual
condition
of
spain
the
more
i
am
satisfied
that
the
true
rule
for
us
is
except
in
the
way
of
good
offices
this
ancient
kingdom
is
now
engaged
in
comedy
and
tragedy
you
have
heard
of
the
the
spanish
comedy
is
a
the
spanish
tragedy
is
sending
armies
against
cuba
i
do
not
wish
to
take
part
in
the
comedy
or
the
tragedy
if
spain
is
wise
she
will
give
up
both
meanwhile
we
have
a
duty
which
is
determined
by
international
law
to
that
venerable
authority
i
repair
what
that
prescribes
i
follow
by
that
law
as
i
understand
it
nations
are
not
left
to
any
mere
caprice
there
is
a
rule
of
conduct
which
they
must
follow
subject
always
to
just
accountability
where
they
depart
from
it
on
ordinary
occasions
there
is
no
question
for
it
is
with
nations
as
with
individuals
it
is
only
where
the
rule
is
obscure
or
precedents
are
uncertain
that
doubt
arises
as
with
some
persons
now
here
i
wish
to
be
explicit
belligerence
is
a
attested
by
evidence
if
the
does
not
exist
there
is
nothing
to
recognize
the
fact
can
not
be
invented
or
imagined
it
must
be
proved
no
matter
what
our
sympathy
what
the
extent
of
our
desires
we
must
look
at
the
fact
there
may
be
insurrection
without
reaching
this
condition
which
is
at
least
the
house
to
independence
the
hungarians
when
they
rose
against
austria
obtained
no
such
recognition
although
they
had
large
armies
in
the
field
and
kossuth
was
their
governor
the
poles
in
repeated
insurrections
against
russia
obtained
no
such
recognition
although
the
conflict
made
europe
vibrate
the
sepoys
and
rajahs
of
india
failed
also
although
for
a
time
the
english
empire
hung
trembling
nor
in
my
opinion
were
our
rebels
ever
entitled
to
such
recognition
for
whatever
the
strength
of
the
rebellion
on
land
it
remained
as
in
the
case
of
hungary
of
poland
of
india
without
those
prize
courts
which
are
absolutely
essential
to
recognition
by
foreign
powers
cruiser
without
accountability
to
prize
courts
is
a
lawless
monster
which
civilized
nations
can
not
therefore
the
prize
court
is
the
nor
is
this
all
if
the
cuban
insurgents
have
come
within
any
of
the
familiar
requirements
i
have
never
seen
the
evidence
they
are
in
arms
i
know
but
where
are
their
cities
towns
provinces
where
their
government
where
their
ports
where
their
tribunals
of
justice
and
where
their
prize
courts
to
put
these
questions
is
to
answer
them
how
then
is
the
of
belligerence
there
is
another
point
in
the
case
which
is
with
me
final
even
if
they
come
within
the
prerequisites
of
international
law
i
am
unwilling
to
make
any
recognition
of
them
so
long
as
they
continue
to
hold
human
beings
as
slaves
which
i
understand
they
now
do
i
am
told
that
there
was
a
decree
in
may
last
purporting
to
be
signed
by
cespedes
abolishing
slavery
then
i
am
told
of
another
decree
in
july
maintaining
slavery
there
is
also
the
story
of
a
constitution
to
be
read
at
home
and
an
constitution
to
be
read
abroad
nor
is
there
any
evidence
that
any
decree
or
constitution
has
had
any
practical
effect
in
this
uncertainty
i
shall
wait
even
if
all
other
things
are
propitious
in
any
event
there
must
be
emancipation
on
the
recognition
of
belligerence
there
is
much
latitude
of
opinion
some
asserting
that
a
nation
may
take
this
step
whenever
it
pleases
but
this
pretension
excludes
the
idea
that
belligerence
is
always
a
question
of
fact
on
the
evidence
undoubtedly
an
independent
nation
may
do
anything
in
its
power
whenever
it
pleases
but
subject
always
to
just
accountability
if
another
suffers
from
what
it
does
this
may
be
illustrated
in
the
three
different
cases
of
war
independence
and
belligerence
in
each
case
the
declaration
is
an
exercise
of
high
prerogative
inherent
in
every
nation
and
kindred
to
that
of
eminent
domain
but
a
nation
declaring
war
without
just
cause
becomes
a
a
nation
recognizing
independence
where
it
does
not
exist
in
fact
becomes
a
and
so
a
nation
recognizing
belligerence
where
it
does
not
exist
in
fact
becomes
a
also
any
present
uncertainty
on
this
last
point
i
attribute
to
the
failure
of
precedents
sufficiently
clear
and
authoritative
but
with
me
there
is
one
rule
in
such
a
case
which
i
can
not
disobey
in
the
absence
of
any
precise
injunction
i
do
not
hesitate
to
adopt
that
interpretation
of
international
law
which
most
restricts
war
and
all
that
makes
for
war
believing
that
in
this
way
i
shall
best
promote
civilization
and
obtain
new
security
for
international
peace
from
the
case
of
spain
i
pass
to
the
case
of
england
contenting
myself
with
a
brief
explanation
on
this
subject
i
have
never
spoken
except
with
pain
as
i
have
been
obliged
to
expose
a
great
transgression
i
hope
to
say
nothing
now
which
shall
augment
difficulties
although
when
i
consider
how
british
anger
was
aroused
by
an
effort
in
another
place
judged
by
all
who
heard
it
most
pacific
in
character
i
do
not
know
that
even
these
few
words
may
not
be
misinterpreted
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
we
received
from
england
incalculable
wrong
greater
i
have
often
said
than
was
ever
before
received
by
one
civilized
power
from
another
short
of
unjust
war
i
do
not
say
this
in
bitterness
but
in
sadness
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
through
english
complicity
our
was
transferred
to
english
bottoms
our
foreign
commerce
sacrificed
while
our
loss
was
gain
our
blockade
rendered
more
expensive
and
generally
that
our
war
with
all
its
fearful
cost
of
blood
and
treasure
was
prolonged
indefinitely
this
terrible
complicity
began
with
the
wrongful
recognition
of
rebel
belligerence
under
whose
shelter
pirate
ships
were
built
and
supplies
sent
forth
all
this
was
at
the
very
moment
of
our
mortal
agony
in
the
midst
of
a
struggle
for
national
life
and
it
was
done
in
support
of
rebels
whose
single
declared
object
of
separate
existence
as
a
nation
was
slavery
being
in
this
respect
clearly
distinguishable
from
an
established
power
where
slavery
is
tolerated
without
being
made
the
vaunted
such
is
the
case
who
shall
fix
the
measure
of
this
great
accountability
for
the
present
it
is
enough
to
expose
it
i
make
no
demand
not
a
dollar
of
money
not
a
word
of
apology
i
show
simply
what
england
has
done
to
us
it
will
be
for
her
on
a
careful
review
of
the
case
to
determine
what
reparation
to
offer
it
will
be
for
the
american
people
on
a
careful
review
of
the
case
to
determine
what
reparation
to
require
on
this
head
i
content
myself
with
the
aspiration
that
out
of
this
surpassing
wrong
and
the
controversy
it
has
engendered
may
come
some
enduring
safeguard
for
the
future
some
landmark
of
humanity
then
will
our
losses
end
in
gain
for
all
while
the
law
of
nations
is
elevated
but
i
have
little
hope
of
any
adequate
settlement
until
our
case
in
its
full
extent
is
heard
in
all
controversies
the
first
stage
of
justice
is
to
understand
the
case
and
sooner
or
later
england
must
understand
ours
the
english
arguments
so
far
as
argument
can
be
found
in
the
recent
heats
have
not
in
any
respect
impaired
the
justice
of
our
complaint
loudly
it
is
said
that
there
can
be
no
sentimental
damages
or
damages
for
wounded
feelings
and
then
our
case
is
dismissed
as
having
nothing
but
this
foundation
now
without
undertaking
to
say
that
there
is
no
remedy
in
the
case
supposed
i
wish
it
understood
that
our
complaint
is
for
damages
traced
directly
to
england
if
the
amount
is
unprecedented
so
also
is
the
wrong
the
scale
of
damages
is
naturally
in
proportion
to
the
scale
of
operations
who
among
us
doubts
that
these
damages
were
received
call
them
what
you
please
to
this
extent
the
nation
lost
the
records
show
how
our
commerce
suffered
and
witnesses
without
number
testify
how
the
blockade
was
broken
and
the
war
prolonged
ask
any
of
our
great
generals
ask
sherman
sheridan
thomas
meade
burnside
ask
grant
in
view
of
this
transcendent
wrong
it
is
a
disparagement
of
international
law
to
say
that
there
is
no
remedy
an
eminent
english
judge
once
pronounced
from
the
bench
that
law
is
astute
to
find
a
but
no
astuteness
is
required
in
this
case
nothing
but
simple
justice
which
is
always
the
object
of
a
true
diplomacy
how
did
the
nation
suffer
to
what
extent
these
are
the
practical
questions
no
technicality
can
be
set
up
on
either
side
are
no
matter
by
what
artificial
term
they
may
be
characterized
opposing
them
as
shows
the
disposition
to
escape
by
technicality
even
while
confessing
an
equitable
liability
since
england
is
bound
for
the
of
her
conduct
bound
under
international
law
which
is
a
law
of
equity
always
and
bound
no
matter
how
the
damages
occurred
provided
they
proceeded
from
because
the
damages
are
national
because
all
suffered
instead
of
one
this
is
no
reason
for
immunity
on
her
part
then
it
is
said
not
consider
our
good
friends
in
england
and
especially
those
noble
who
stood
by
us
so
bravely
we
do
consider
them
always
and
give
them
gratitude
for
their
generous
alliance
they
belong
to
what
our
own
poet
has
called
nobility
of
but
they
are
not
england
we
trace
no
damages
to
them
nor
to
any
class
high
or
low
but
to
england
corporate
england
through
whose
government
we
suffered
then
again
it
is
said
not
exhibit
an
account
against
france
for
the
good
reason
that
while
france
erred
with
england
in
recognition
of
rebel
belligerence
no
pirate
ships
or
were
built
under
shelter
of
this
recognition
to
prey
upon
our
commerce
the
two
cases
are
wide
asunder
and
they
are
distinguished
by
two
different
phrases
of
the
common
law
the
recognition
of
rebel
belligerence
in
france
was
wrong
without
injury
but
that
same
recognition
in
england
was
wrong
with
injury
and
it
is
of
this
unquestionable
injury
that
we
complain
it
can
not
be
doubted
that
this
great
question
so
long
as
it
continues
pending
will
be
a
cloud
always
upon
the
relations
of
two
friendly
powers
when
there
should
be
sunshine
good
men
on
both
sides
should
desire
its
settlement
and
in
such
way
as
most
to
promote
and
make
the
best
precedent
for
civilization
but
there
can
be
no
without
justice
nor
can
any
establish
any
rule
for
the
future
nothing
will
do
now
but
a
full
inquiry
without
limitation
or
technicality
and
a
candid
acceptance
of
the
result
there
must
be
equity
which
is
justice
without
technicality
sometimes
there
are
whispers
of
territorial
compensation
and
canada
is
named
as
the
consideration
but
he
knows
england
little
and
little
also
of
that
great
english
liberty
from
magna
charta
to
the
somerset
case
who
supposes
that
this
nation
could
undertake
any
such
transfer
and
he
knows
our
country
little
and
little
also
of
that
great
liberty
which
is
ours
who
supposes
that
we
could
receive
such
a
transfer
on
each
side
there
is
impossibility
territory
may
be
conveyed
but
not
a
people
i
allude
to
this
suggestion
only
because
appearing
in
the
public
press
it
has
been
answered
from
england
but
the
united
states
can
never
be
indifferent
to
canada
nor
to
the
other
british
provinces
near
neighbors
and
kindred
it
is
well
known
historically
that
even
before
the
declaration
of
independence
our
fathers
hoped
that
canada
would
take
part
with
them
washington
was
strong
in
this
hope
so
was
franklin
the
continental
congress
by
solemn
resolution
invited
canada
and
then
appointed
a
commission
with
benjamin
franklin
at
its
head
form
an
union
between
the
united
colonies
and
the
people
of
in
the
careful
instructions
of
the
congress
signed
in
their
behalf
by
john
hancock
president
the
commissioners
are
among
other
things
enjoined
the
strongest
terms
to
assure
the
people
of
canada
that
it
is
our
earnest
desire
to
adopt
them
into
our
union
as
a
sister
colony
and
to
secure
the
same
general
system
of
mild
and
equal
laws
for
them
and
for
ourselves
with
only
such
local
differences
as
may
be
agreeable
to
each
colony
and
further
that
in
the
judgment
of
the
congress
interest
and
ours
are
inseparably
long
ago
the
continental
congress
passed
away
living
only
in
its
deeds
long
ago
the
great
commissioner
rested
from
his
labors
to
become
a
star
in
our
firmament
but
the
invitation
survives
not
only
in
the
archives
of
our
history
but
in
all
american
hearts
constant
and
continuing
as
when
first
issued
believing
as
we
do
that
such
a
union
in
the
fulness
of
time
with
the
of
the
mother
country
and
the
accord
of
both
parties
must
be
the
harbinger
of
infinite
good
nor
do
i
doubt
that
this
will
be
accomplished
such
a
union
was
clearly
foreseen
by
the
late
richard
cobden
who
in
a
letter
to
myself
bearing
date
london
november
wrote
agree
with
you
that
nature
has
decided
that
and
the
united
states
must
become
for
all
purposes
of
intercommunication
whether
they
also
shall
be
united
in
the
same
federal
government
must
depend
upon
the
two
parties
to
the
union
i
can
assure
you
that
there
will
be
no
repetition
of
the
policy
of
on
our
part
to
prevent
our
north
american
colonies
from
pursuing
their
interests
in
their
own
way
if
the
people
of
canada
are
tolerably
unanimous
in
wishing
to
sever
the
very
slight
thread
which
now
binds
them
to
this
country
i
see
no
reason
why
if
good
faith
and
ordinary
temper
be
observed
it
should
not
be
done
nearly
twenty
years
have
passed
since
these
prophetic
words
and
enough
has
already
taken
place
to
give
assurance
of
the
rest
once
established
by
treaty
and
now
so
often
desired
on
both
sides
will
be
transfigured
in
union
while
our
plural
unit
is
strengthened
and
extended
the
end
is
certain
nor
shall
we
wait
long
for
its
mighty
fulfilment
its
beginning
is
the
establishment
of
peace
at
home
through
which
the
national
unity
shall
become
manifest
this
is
the
first
step
the
rest
will
follow

interest
happily
slavery
no
longer
exists
to
disturb
the
peace
of
our
republic
but
it
is
not
yet
dead
in

lands
while
among

the
impious
pretension
of
this
great
wrong
still
survives
against
the
african
because
he
is
black
and
against
the
chinese
because
he
is

here
is
nothing
less
than
the
claim
of
hereditary
power
from
color

it
assumes
that
human
beings
cast
in
the
same

such
is

pretension

it

to
show
how
inconsistent
is
this
pretension
with
our
character
as
a
republic
and
with
the
promises
of
our
fathers
all
of
which
i
consider
it
never
out
of
order
to
say
and
to
urge
but
my
present
purpose
is
rather
to
show
how
inconsistent
it
is
with
that
sublime
truth
being
part
of
law
for
the
government
of
the
world
which
teaches
the
unity
of

and
its
final
harmony
on
earth
in
this
law
which
is
both
commandment
and
promise
i
find
duties
and
hopes
perpetual
duties
never
to
be
postponed
and
perpetual
hopes
never
to
be
abandoned
so
long
as
man
is
man
believing
in
this
law
and
profoundly
convinced
that
by
the
blessing
of
god
it
will
all
be
fulfilled
on
earth
it
is
easy
to
see
how
unreasonable
is
a
claim
of
power
founded
on
any
unchangeable
physical
incident
derived
from
birth
because
man
is
black
because
man
is
yellow
he
is
none
the
less
man
because
man
is
white
he
is
none
the
more
man
by
this
great
title
he
is
universal
heir
to
all
that
man
can
claim
because
he
is
man
and
not
on
account
of
color
he
enters
into
possession
of
the
promised
dominion
over
the
animal
kingdom
the
fish
of
the
sea
and
over
the
fowl
of
the
air
and
over
every
living
thing
that
moveth
upon
the
but
this
equal
copartnership
without
distinction
of
color
symbolizes
equal
copartnership
in
all
the
rights
of
man
as
i
enter
upon
this
important
theme
i
confess
an
unwelcome
impediment
partly
from
the
prevailing
prejudice
of
color
which
has
become
with
many
what
is
sometimes
called
a
second
nature
and
partly
from
the
little
faith
among
men
in
the
future
development
of
the
race
the
cry
white
government
which
is
such
an
insult
to
human
nature
has
influence
in
the
work
of
degradation
accustomed
to
this
effrontery
people
do
not
see
its
ineffable
absurdity
which
is
made
conspicuous
if
they
simply
consider
the
figure
our
fathers
would
have
cut
had
they
declared
the
equal
rights
of
men
and
not
the
equal
rights
of
the
great
declaration
was
axiomatic
and
because
universal
confined
to
a
class
it
would
have
been
neither
hearkening
to
this
disgusting
cry
people
close
the
soul
to
all
the
quickening
voices
whether
of
prophet
poet
or
philosopher
by
which
we
are
encouraged
to
persevere
nor
do
they
heed
the
best
lessons
of
science
i
begin
by
declaring
an
unalterable
faith
in
the
future
which
nothing
can
diminish
or
impair
other
things
i
may
renounce
but
this
i
can
not
throughout
a
life
of
controversy
and
opposition
frequently
in
a
small
minority
sometimes
almost
alone
i
have
never
for
a
moment
doubted
the
final
fulfilment
of
the
great
promises
for
humanity
without
which
this
world
would
be
a
continuing
chaos
to
me
it
was
clear
from
the
beginning
even
in
the
early
darkness
and
then
in
the
bloody
mists
of
war
that
slavery
must
yield
to
efforts
against
it
and
now
it
is
equally
clear
that
every
kindred
pretension
must
yield
likewise
until
all
are
in
the
full
fruition
of
those
equal
rights
which
are
the
crown
of
life
on
earth
nor
can
this
great
triumph
be
restricted
to
our
republic
wherever
men
are
gathered
into
nations
wherever
civilization
extends
her
beneficent
sway
there
will
it
be
manifest
against
this
lofty
truth
the
assaults
of
the
adversary
are
no
better
than
the
arrows
of
barbarians
vainly
shot
at
the
sun
still
it
moves
and
it
will
move
until
all
rejoice
in
its
beams
the
hereafter
in
which
the
poet
pictures
personal
success
is
a
feeble
expression
for
that
transcendent
future
where
man
shall
be
conqueror
not
only
over
nations
but
over
himself
subduing
pride
of
birth
prejudice
of
class
pretension
of
caste
the
assurances
of
the
future
are
strengthened
when
i
look
at
government
and
see
how
its
character
constantly
improves
as
it
comes
within
the
sphere
of
knowledge
men
must
know
before
they
can
act
wisely
and
this
simple
rule
is
applicable
alike
to
individuals
and
communities
my
son
said
the
swedish
chancellor
see
with
what
little
wisdom
the
world
is
down
to
his
day
government
was
little
more
than
an
expedient
a
device
a
trick
for
the
aggrandizement
of
a
class
of
a
few
or
it
may
be
of
one
calling
itself
commonwealth
it
was
so
in
name
only
there
were
classes
always
and
egotism
was
the
prevailing
law
macchiavelli
the
herald
of
modern
politics
insisted
that
all
governments
whether
monarchical
or
republican
owed
their
origin
or
reformation
to
a
single
lawgiver
like
lycurgus
or
solon
if
this
was
true
in
his
day
it
is
not
in
ours
in
the
presence
of
an
enlightened
people
a
single
lawgiver
or
an
aristocracy
of
lawgivers
is
impossible
while
government
becomes
the
rule
of
all
for
the
good
of
all
not
the
one
man
power
so
constant
in
history
not
the
triumvirate
sometimes
occurring
not
an
oligarchy
which
is
the
rule
of
a
few
not
an
aristocracy
which
is
the
rule
of
a
class
not
any
combination
howsoever
accepted
sanctioning
exclusions
but
the
whole
body
of
the
people
without
exclusion
of
any
kind
or
in
the
great
words
of
abraham
lincoln
at
gettysburg
of
the
people
by
the
people
and
for
the
thus
far
government
has
been
at
best
an
art
like
alchemy
or
astrology
where
ministers
exercised
a
subtle
power
or
speculators
tried
imaginative
experiments
seeking
some
at
the
expense
of
the
people
though
in
many
respects
still
an
art
only
it
is
fast
becoming
a
science
founded
on
principles
and
laws
from
which
there
can
be
no
just
departure
as
a
science
it
is
determined
by
knowledge
like
any
other
science
aided
by
that
universal
handmaid
the
philosophy
of
induction
from
a
succession
of
particulars
the
general
rule
is
deduced
and
this
is
as
true
of
government
as
of
chemistry
or
astronomy
nor
do
i
see
reason
to
doubt
that
in
the
evolution
of
events
the
time
is
at
hand
when
government
will
be
subordinated
to
unquestionable
truth
making
diversity
of
opinion
as
impossible
in
this
lofty
science
as
it
is
now
impossible
in
other
sciences
already
mastered
by
man
science
accomplishes
part
only
of
its
beneficent
work
when
it
brings
physical
nature
within
its
domain
that
other
nature
found
in
man
must
be
brought
within
the
same
domain
and
is
it
true
that
man
can
look
into
the
unfathomable
universe
there
to
measure
suns
and
stars
that
he
can
penetrate
the
uncounted
ages
of
the
existence
reading
everywhere
the
inscriptions
upon
its
rocks
but
that
he
can
not
look
into
himself
or
penetrate
his
own
nature
to
measure
human
capacities
and
read
the
inscriptions
upon
the
human
soul
i
do
not
believe
it
what
is
already
accomplished
in
such
large
measure
for
the
world
of
matter
will
yet
be
accomplished
for
that
other
world
of
humanity
and
then
it
will
appear
by
a
law
as
precise
as
any
in
chemistry
or
astronomy
that
just
government
stands
only
on
the
consent
of
the
governed
that
all
men
must
be
equal
before
the
law
of
man
as
they
are
equal
before
the
law
of
god
and
that
any
discrimination
founded
on
the
accident
of
birth
is
inconsistent
with
that
true
science
of
government
which
is
simply
the
science
of
justice
on
earth
one
of
our
teachers
who
has
shed
much
light
on
the
science
of
government
i
refer
to
professor
lieber
of
new
york
shows
that
the
state
is
what
he
calls
society
precisely
as
the
church
is
a
religious
society
and
an
insurance
company
a
financial
society
the
term
is
felicitous
as
it
is
suggestive
above
the
state
rises
the
image
of
justice
lofty
blindfold
with
balance
in
hand
there
it
stands
in
colossal
form
with
constant
lesson
of
equal
rights
for
all
while
under
its
inspiration
government
proceeds
according
to
laws
which
can
not
be
disobeyed
with
impunity
and
providence
is
behind
to
sustain
the
righteous
hand
in
proportion
as
men
are
wise
they
recognize
these
laws
and
confess
the
exalted
science
is
the
injunction
which
ancient
piety
inscribed
in
letters
of
gold
in
the
temple
at
delphi
the
famous
oracle
is
mute
but
the
divine
injunction
survives
nor
is
it
alone
saint
augustine
impresses
it
in
his
own
eloquent
way
when
he
says
go
to
admire
the
heights
of
mountains
and
the
great
waves
of
the
sea
and
the
widest
flow
of
rivers
and
the
compass
of
the
ocean
and
the
circuits
of
the
stars
leave
themselves
following
the
early
mandate
thus
seconded
by
the
most
persuasive
of
the
christian
fathers
man
will
consider
his
place
in
the
universe
and
his
relations
to
his
brother
man
looking
into
his
soul
he
will
there
find
the
great
irreversible
law
of
right
universal
for
the
nation
as
for
himself
commanding
to
do
unto
others
as
we
would
have
them
do
unto
us
and
under
the
safeguard
of
this
universal
law
i
now
place
the
rights
of
all
mankind
it
is
little
that
i
can
do
but
taking
counsel
of
my
desires
i
am
not
without
hope
of
contributing
something
to
that
just
judgment
which
shall
blast
the
effrontery
of
caste
as
doubly
offensive
not
only
to
the
idea
of
a
republic
but
to
human
nature
itself
already
you
are
prepared
to
condemn
caste
when
you
understand
its
real
character
to
this
end
let
me
carry
you
to
that
ancient
india
with
its
population
of
more
than
a
hundred
and
eighty
millions
where
this
artificial
discrimination
born
of
impossible
fable
was
for
ages
the
dominating
institution
of
society
being
in
fact
what
slavery
was
in
our
rebellion
the
of
the
whole
structure
the
portuguese
were
the
first
of
european
nations
to
form
establishments
in
india
and
therefore
through
them
was
the
civilized
world
first
acquainted
with
its
peculiar
institutions
but
i
know
no
monument
of
their
presence
there
and
no
contribution
from
them
to
our
knowledge
of
the
country
so
enduring
as
the
word
caste
or
in
the
portuguese
language
by
which
they
designated
those
rigid
orders
or
ranks
into
which
the
people
of
india
were
divided
the
term
originally
applied
by
them
has
been
adopted
in
the
other
languages
of
europe
where
it
signifies
primarily
the
orders
or
ranks
of
india
but
by
natural
extension
any
separate
and
fixed
order
of
society
in
the
latter
sense
caste
is
now
constantly
employed
the
word
is
too
modern
however
for
our
classical
english
literature
or
for
that
most
authentic
record
of
our
language
the
dictionary
of
johnson
when
it
first
saw
the
light
in
though
the
word
was
unknown
in
earlier
times
the
hereditary
discrimination
it
describes
entered
into
the
political
system
of
modern
europe
where
people
were
distributed
into
classes
and
the
son
succeeded
to
the
condition
of
his
father
whether
of
privilege
or
disability
the
son
of
a
noble
being
a
noble
with
great
privileges
the
son
of
a
mechanic
being
a
mechanic
with
great
disabilities
and
this
inherited
condition
was
applicable
even
to
the
special
labor
of
the
father
nor
was
there
any
business
beyond
its
tyrannical
control
according
to
macaulay
tinkers
formed
an
hereditary
the
father
of
john
bunyan
was
a
tinker
and
the
son
inherited
the
position
the
french
revolution
did
much
to
shake
this
irrational
system
yet
in
many
parts
of
europe
down
to
this
day
the
son
emancipates
himself
with
difficulty
from
the
class
in
which
he
is
born
but
just
in
proportion
to
the
triumph
of
equality
does
caste
disappear
this
institution
is
essentially
barbarous
and
therefore
appears
in
barbarous
ages
or
in
countries
not
yet
relieved
from
the
early
incubus
it
flourished
side
by
side
with
the
sculptured
bulls
and
cuneïform
characters
of
assyria
side
by
side
with
the
pyramids
and
hieroglyphics
of
egypt
it
showed
itself
under
the
ambitious
sway
of
persia
and
even
in
the
cecropian
era
of
attica
in
all
these
countries
caste
was
organized
differing
somewhat
in
divisions
but
hereditary
in
character
and
the
same
phenomenon
arrested
the
attention
of
the
conquering
spaniards
in
peru
the
system
had
two
distinct
elements
first
separation
with
rank
and
privilege
or
their
opposite
with
degradation
and
disability
secondly
descent
from
father
to
son
so
that
it
was
perpetual
separation
from
generation
to
generation
in
hindustan
this
dreadful
system
which
under
the
name
of
order
is
the
organization
of
disorder
has
prolonged
itself
to
our
day
so
as
to
be
a
living
admonition
to
mankind
that
we
may
shun
the
evil
it
entails
in
whatever
shape
i
now
endeavor
to
expose
its
true
character
the
regular
castes
of
india
are
four
in
number
called
in
sanscrit
or
although
it
does
not
appear
that
by
nature
they
were
of
different
colors
their
origin
will
be
found
in
the
sacred
of
the
hindoos
the
of
menu
where
it
is
recorded
that
the
creator
caused
the
brahmin
the
cshatriya
the
vaisya
and
the
sudra
so
named
from
and
to
proceed
from
his
mouth
his
arm
his
thigh
and
his
foot
appointing
separate
duties
for
each
class
to
the
brahmin
proceeding
from
the
mouth
was
allotted
the
duty
of
reading
the
veda
and
of
teaching
it
to
the
cshatriya
proceeding
from
the
arm
the
duty
of
soldier
to
the
vaisya
proceeding
from
the
thigh
the
duty
of
cultivating
the
land
and
keeping
herds
of
cattle
and
to
the
sudra
proceeding
from
the
foot
was
appointed
the
chief
duty
of
serving
the
other
classes
without
depreciating
their
worth
such
was
the
original
assignment
of
parts
but
under
the
operation
of
natural
laws
those
already
elevated
increased
their
importance
while
those
already
degraded
sank
lower
ascent
from
an
inferior
class
was
absolutely
impossible
as
well
might
a
vegetable
become
a
man
the
distinction
was
perpetuated
by
the
injunction
that
each
should
marry
only
in
his
own
class
with
sanguinary
penalties
upon
any
attempted
amalgamation
the
brahmin
was
child
of
rank
and
privilege
the
sudra
child
of
degradation
and
disability
omitting
the
two
intermediate
classes
soldiers
and
husbandmen
look
for
one
moment
at
the
two
extremes
as
described
by
the
sacred
volume
the
brahmin
is
constantly
hailed
as
and
by
right
chief
of
the
whole
creation
this
eminence
is
declared
in
various
terms
thus
it
is
said
a
brahmin
springs
to
light
he
is
born
above
the
and
then
again
exists
in
the
universe
is
all
in
effect
the
wealth
of
the
as
he
engrosses
the
favor
of
the
deity
so
is
he
entitled
to
the
veneration
of
mortals
and
thus
learned
or
ignorant
he
is
a
powerful
divinity
even
as
fire
is
a
powerful
divinity
whether
consecrated
or
immunities
of
all
kinds
cluster
about
him
not
for
the
most
insufferable
crime
can
he
be
touched
in
person
or
property
nor
can
he
be
called
to
pay
taxes
while
all
other
classes
must
bestow
their
wealth
upon
him
such
is
the
brahmin
with
these
privileges
crystallized
in
his
blood
from
generation
to
generation
on
the
other
hand
is
the
sudra
who
is
the
contrast
in
all
particulars
as
much
as
the
brahmin
is
object
of
constant
veneration
so
is
the
sudra
object
of
constant
contempt
as
one
is
exalted
above
humanity
so
is
the
other
degraded
below
it
the
life
of
the
sudra
is
servile
but
according
to
the
sacred
volume
he
was
created
by
the
especially
to
serve
the
brahmin
everywhere
his
degradation
is
manifest
he
holds
no
property
which
a
brahmin
may
not
seize
the
crime
he
commits
is
visited
with
the
most
condign
punishment
beyond
that
allotted
to
other
classes
subject
to
punishment
the
least
disrespect
to
a
brahmin
is
terribly
avenged
for
presuming
to
sit
on
a
carpet
the
penalty
is
branding
and
banishment
or
maiming
for
contumelious
words
to
a
brahmin
it
is
an
iron
style
ten
fingers
long
thrust
into
the
mouth
and
for
offering
instruction
to
a
brahmin
it
is
nothing
less
than
hot
oil
poured
into
mouth
and
ears
such
is
the
sudra
and
this
fearful
degradation
with
all
its
disabilities
is
crystallized
in
his
blood
from
generation
to
generation
below
these
is
another
more
degraded
even
than
the
sudra
being
the
outcast
with
no
place
in
either
of
the
four
regular
castes
and
known
commonly
as
the
pariah
here
is
another
term
imported
into
familiar
usage
to
signify
generally
those
on
whom
society
has
set
its
ban
no
person
of
the
regular
castes
holds
communication
with
the
pariah
his
presence
is
contaminating
milk
and
even
water
is
defiled
by
his
passing
shadow
and
can
not
be
used
until
purified
the
brahmin
sometimes
puts

at

in

of
our
country
once
applied
to
another
people
he
has
no
rights
which
a
brahmin
is
bound
to
respect
such
a
system
so
shocking
to
the
natural
sense
has
been
denounced
by
all
who
have
considered
it
whether
on
the
spot
or
at
a
distance
unless
i
except
the
excellent
historian
robertson
who
seems
to
find
apologies
for
it
as
men
among
us
find
apologies
for
the
caste
which
sends
its
lengthening
shadow
across
our
republic
i
might
take
your
time
until
late
in
the
evening
unfolding
its
obvious
evil
as
exposed
by
those
who
have
witnessed
its
operation
this
testimony
is
collected
in
a
work
entitled
opposed
to
christianity
by
rev
joseph
roberts
and
published
in
london
in
i
give
brief
specimens
only
a
hindoo
converted
to
christianity
exposes
its
demoralizing
influence
when
he
says
is
the
stronghold
of
pride
which
makes
a
man
think
of
himself
more
highly
than
he
ought
to
and
so
also
another
converted
hindoo
when
he
says
makes
a
man
think
that
he
is
holier
than
another
and
that
he
has
some
inherent
virtue
which
another
has
and
still
another
converted
hindoo
when
he
says
is
part
and
parcel
of
idolatry
and
all
heathen
but
no
testimony
surpasses
that
of
the
eminent
reginald
heber
the
bishop
of
calcutta
when
he
declares
that
it
is
system
which
tends
more
than
anything
else
the
devil
has
yet
invented
to
destroy
the
feelings
of
general
benevolence
and
to
make
nine
tenths
of
mankind
the
hopeless
slaves
of
the
under
these
protests
and
the
growing
influence
of
christianity
the
system
is
so
far
mitigated
that
according
to
an
able
writer
whose
soul
is
enlisted
against
it
distinctions
are
felt
on
certain
limited
occasions
these
are
the
words
of
james
mill
interesting
always
as
the
author
of
the
best
work
on
india
and
the
father
of
john
stuart
mill
it
is
now
admitted
that
under
constraint
of
necessity
the
member
of
a
superior
caste
may
descend
to
the
pursuits
of
an
inferior
caste
the
lofty
brahmin
engages
in
traffic
yet
he
can
not
touch
for
contact
with
this
article
of
commerce
is
polluting
but
i
am
obliged
to
add
that
no
modification
leaving
transmissible
with
the
blood
can
be
adequate
so
long
as
these
continue
the
natural
harmonies
of
society
are
disturbed
and
man
is
degraded
the
system
in
its
mildest
form
can
have
nothing
but
evil
for
it
is
a
constant
violation
of
primal
truth
and
a
constant
obstruction
to
that
progress
which
is
the
appointed
destiny
of
man
change
now
the
scene
from
ancient
india
and
the
shadow
of
unknown
centuries
to
our
republic
born
on
yesterday
how
unlike
in
venerable
antiquity
how
like
in
the
pretension
of
caste
here
the
caste
claiming
hereditary
rank
and
privilege
is
white
the
caste
doomed
to
hereditary
degradation
and
disability
is
black
or
yellow
and
it
is
gravely
asserted
that
this
difference
of
color
marks
difference
of
race
which
in
itself
justifies
the
discrimination
to
save
this
enormity
of
claim
from
indignant
reprobation
it
is
insisted
that
the
varieties
of
men
do
not
proceed
from
a
common
stock
that
they
are
different
in
origin
that
this
difference
is
perpetuated
in
their
respective
capacities
and
the
apology
concludes
with
the
practical
assumption
that
the
white
man
is
a
superior
caste
not
unlike
the
brahmin
while
the
black
man
is
an
inferior
caste
not
unlike
the
sudra
sometimes
even
the
pariah
nor
is
the
yellow
man
exempted
from
this
same
insulting
proscription
when
i
consider
how
for
a
long
time
the
african
was
shut
out
from
testifying
in
court
even
when
seeking
redress
for
the
grossest
outrage
and
how
at
this
time
in
some
places
the
chinese
is
also
shut
out
from
testifying
in
court
each
seems
to
have
been
little
better
than
the
pariah
in
stating
this
assumption
of
superiority
which
i
do
not
exaggerate
i
open
a
question
of
surpassing
interest
whether
in
science
government
or
religion
here
i
must
not
forget
that
some
who
admit
the
common
origin
of
all
men
insist
that
the
african
is
descended
from
ham
son
of
noah
through
canaan
cursed
by
noah
to
be
servant
of
his
brethren
and
that
therefore
he
may
be
degraded
even
to
slavery
but
this
apology
is
not
original
with
us
nobles
in
poland
seized
upon
it
to
justify
their
lordly
pretensions
calling
their
serfs
though
white
descendants
of
ham
but
whether
employed
by
pole
or
american
it
is
worthy
only
of
derision
i
do
not
know
that
this
apology
is
invoked
for
maltreating
the
chinese
although
he
is
descended
from
ham
as
much
as
the
pole
two
passages
of
scripture
one
in
the
old
testament
and
the
other
in
the
new
both
governing
this
question
attest
the
unity
of
the
human
family
the
first
is
in
that
sublime
chapter
of
genesis
where
amidst
the
wonders
of
creation
it
is
said
god
created
man
in
his
own
image
in
the
image
of
god
created
he
him
male
and
female
created
he
them
and
god
blessed
them
and
god
said
unto
them
be
fruitful
and
multiply
and
replenish
the
earth
and
subdue
the
other
passage
is
from
that
great
sermon
of
saint
paul
when
standing
in
the
midst
of
mars
hill
he
proclaimed
to
the
men
of
athens
and
through
them
to
all
mankind
that
god
made
of
all
nations
of
men
for
to
dwell
on
all
the
face
of
the
if
as
is
sometimes
argued
there
be
ambiguity
in
the
account
of
the
creation
or
if
in
any
way
its
authority
has
been
impaired
by
scientific
criticism
there
is
nothing
of
the
kind
to
detract
from
the
sermon
of
saint
paul
which
must
continue
forevermore
venerable
and
beautiful
appealing
from
these
texts
the
apologists
hurry
to
science
and
there
i
follow
but
i
must
compress
into
paragraphs
what
might
fill
volumes
ethnology
to
which
we
repair
is
a
science
of
recent
origin
exhibiting
the
different
races
or
varieties
of
man
in
their
relations
with
each
other
as
that
other
science
anthropology
exhibits
man
in
his
relation
to
the
animal
world
nature
and
history
are
our
authorities
but
all
science
and
all
knowledge
are
tributary
perhaps
no
other
theme
is
grander
for
it
is
the
very
beginning
of
human
history
in
which
all
nations
and
men
have
a
common
interest
its
vastness
is
increased
when
we
consider
that
it
embraces
properly
not
only
the
origin
distribution
and
capacity
of
man
but
his
destiny
on
earth
stretching
into
the
infinite
past
stretching
also
into
the
infinite
future
and
thus
spanning
humanity
the
subject
is
entirely
modern
hippocrates
one
of
our
ancient
masters
has
left
a
treatise
on
water
and
place
where
climatic
influences
are
recognized
but
nobody
in
antiquity
studied
the
varieties
of
our
race
or
regarded
its
origin
except
mythically
the
discovery
of
america
and
the
later
circumnavigation
of
the
globe
followed
by
the
development
of
the
sciences
generally
prepared
the
way
for
this
new
science
it
is
obvious
to
the
most
superficial
observer
that
there
are
divisions
or
varieties
in
the
human
family
commonly
called
races
but
the
most
careful
explorations
of
science
leave
the
number
uncertain
these
differences
are
in
color
and
in
skull
also
in
language
of
these
the
most
obvious
is
color
but
here
again
the
varieties
multiply
in
proportion
as
we
consider
transitional
or
intermediate
hues
two
great
teachers

the
last
century

buffon

his
eloquent
portraiture

he
was
followed
by
blumenbach
who
also
recognizes
five
with
the
names
which
have
become
so
famous
since
caucasian
mongolian
ethiopian
american
and
malay
here
first
appears
the
popular
but
deceptive
term
caucasian
for
nobody
supposes
now
that
the

blumenbach

if

another

of
the

if
i
mention
other
attempts
it
is
only
to
show
how
science
hesitates
before
this
great
problem
cuvier
reduces
the

are
recognized
on
the
monuments
of
ancient

as
they
appear
in
the
magnificent
works

lepsius
our
own
countryman
pickering
whose
experience
was
gained
on
the
exploring
expedition
of
captain
wilkes
in
his
work

enumerates
eleven
varieties
of

his
opinion
is
no
middle
ground
between
the
admission
of
eleven
distinct
species

human
family
and
the
reduction
to
the
dutch
anatomist

the
human
family
by
the
facial
angle
ranging
from
eighty
degrees
in
the
european
down
to
seventy
degrees

negro
this
attempt
was
continued
by
virey
who
divides
man
into
two
species
the
first
with
a
facial
angle
of
to
including
caucasian
mongolian
and
american
and
the
second
with
a
facial
angle

to
including
malay

hottentot
and
papuan

the
negro

voluminous
works
constitute

ethnological
mine
finds
chiefly
from
the

varieties

calls

turanian
or
mongolian
american
including
esquimaux
hottentot
and
bushman
negro
papuan
or
polynesian
australian
the
same
industrious
observer
finds
three
principal
varieties
in
the
conformation
of
the
head
corresponding
respectively
to
savage
nomadic
and
civilized
man
in
the
savage
african
and
australian
the
jaw
is
prolonged
forward
constituting
what
he
calls
by
an
expressive
term
in
the
nomadic
mongolian
the
skull
is
pyramidal
and
the
face
broad
in
civilized
man
the
skull
is
oval
or
elliptical
but
the
naturalist
records
that
there
are
forms
of
transition
as
nations
approach
to
civilization
or
relapse
into
barbarism
thus
does
the
human
skull
refuse
any
definitive
answer
there
are
varieties
of
skull
as
of
color
but
the
question
remains
to
what
extent
they
attest
original
diversity
equally
vain
is
the
attempt
to
obtain
a
guide
in
the
form
of
the
human
pelvis
but
every
such
attempt
and
its
failure
have
their
lesson
there
remains
one
other
criterion
i
mean
language
and
here
the
testimony
is
such
as
to
disturb
all
divisions
founded
on
color
or
skull
for
it
is
ascertained
that
people
differing
in
these
respects
speak
languages
having
a
common
origin
the
ancient
sanscrit
sometimes
called
the
most
elaborate
of
human
dialects
has
yielded
its
secret
to
philological
research
and
now
stands
forth
the
mother
tongue
of
the
european
nations
it
is
difficult
to
measure
the
importance
of
this
revelation
for
while
not
decisive
on
the
main
question
it
increases
our
difficulty
in
accepting
any
postulate
of
original
diversity
and
now
the
question
arises
how
are
these
varieties
to
be
regarded
in
the
light
of
science
are
they
aboriginal
and
from
the
beginning
or
are
they
by
secondary
causes
of
which
the
record
is
lost
in
the
extended
night
preceding
our
historic
day
here
the
authorities
are
divided
on
the
one
side
we
are
reminded
that
within
the
period
of
recognized
chronology
no
perceptible
change
has
occurred
in
any
of
these
varieties
that
on
the
earliest
monuments
of
egypt
the
african
is
pictured
precisely
as
we
see
him
now
even
to
that
servitude
from
which
among
us
he
is
happily
released
and
it
is
insisted
that
no
known
influences
of
climate
or
place
are
sufficient
to
explain
such
transformations
from
an
aboriginal
type
while
plural
types
are
in
conformity
with
the
analogies
of
the
animal
and
vegetable
world
on
the
other
side
we
are
reminded
that
whatever
may
be
the
difficulties
from
supposing
a
common
centre
of
creation
there
are
greater
still
in
supposing
plural
centres
that
it
is
easier
to
understand
one
creation
than
many
that
geographical
science
makes
us
acquainted
with
intermediate
gradations
of
color
and
conformation
in
which
the
great
contrasts
disappear
that
even
within
the
last
and
in
europe
people
have
tended
to
lose
their
national
physiognomy
and
run
into
a
common
type
thus
attesting
subjection
to
transforming
influences
that
after
accepting
the
races
already
described
there
are
other
varieties
national
family
and
individual
not
less
difficult
of
explanation
and
it
is
insisted
that
whatever
these
varieties
be
they
few
or
many
there
is
among
them
all
overruling
by
which
they
are
constituted
one
and
the
same
cosmopolitan
species
endowed
with
speech
reason
conscience
and
the
hope
of
immortality
knitting
all
together
in
a
common
humanity
and
amidst
all
seeming
differences
making
all
as
near
to
each
other
as
they
are
far
apart
from
every
other
created
thing
while
to
every
one
is
given
that
great
first
instrument
of
civilization
the
human
hand
by
which
the
earth
is
tilled
cities
built
history
written
and
the
stars
measured
and
this
unquestionable
unity
is
pronounced
evidence
of
a
common
origin
in
considering
this
great
question
do
all
inquirers
sufficiently
recognize
the
element
of
time
obviously
the
sphere
of
operation
is
enlarged
in
proportion
to
the
time
employed
everything
is
possible
with
time
confining
ourselves
to
recognized
chronology
existing
varieties
can
not
be
reconciled
with
that
unity
found
in
a
common
origin
what
are
the
six
thousand
years
of
hebrew
time
what
are
the
thousand
years
of
human
annals
sanctioned
by
the
learning
and
piety
of
bunsen
for
the
consummation
of
these
transformations
and
this
longest
period
how
brief
for
the
completion
of
those
two
marvellous
languages
sanscrit
and
greek
which
at
the
earliest
dawn
of
authentic
history
were
already
so
perfect
considering
the
infinitudes
of
astronomy
and
those
other
infinitudes
of
geology
it
is
not
unreasonable
to
claim
an
antiquity
for
primeval
man
compared
with
which
all
the
years
of
authentic
history
are
a
span
with
such
incalculable
opportunity
amidst
unknown
changes
of
nature
where
heat
and
cold
strove
for
mastery
no
transformation
consistent
with
the
preservation
of
the
characteristic
species
was
impossible
egypt
is
not
alone
in
its
sphinx
perplexing
mortals
with
perpetual
enigma
science
is
our
sphinx
and
its
enigma
is
man
and
his
varieties
on
earth
to
which
i
answer
nor
is
it
unreasonable
to
suppose
that
at
the
creation
conditions
were
stamped
upon
man
making
transformations
natural
because
unnatural
according
to
observation
during
the
brief
period
of
historic
time
it
does
not
follow
that
they
are
not
strictly
according
to
law
the
famous
calculating
engine
of
charles
babbage
the
distinguished
mathematician
as
described
in
his
remarkable
treatise
where
science
vindicates
anew
the
ways
of
providence
to
man
supplies
an
illustration
which
is
not
without
instruction
this
machine
with
a
power
almost
miraculous
was
so
adjusted
as
to
produce
a
series
of
natural
numbers
in
regular
order
from
unity
to
a
number
expressed
by
one
hundred
millions
and
one
when
another
series
was
commenced
regulated
by
a
different
law
which
continued
until
at
a
certain
number
the
series
was
again
changed
and
all
these
changes
in
the
immense
progression
proceeded
from
a
propulsion
at
the
beginning
any
simple
observer
finding
that
the
series
stretched
onwards
through
successive
millions
would
have
no
hesitation
in
concluding
from
the
vast
induction
that
it
must
proceed
always
according
to
the
same
law
and
yet
it
was
not
so
but
the
calculating
engine
is
only
a
contrivance
of
human
skill
and
can
not
the
creator
do
as
much
that
is
a
very
inadequate
conception
of
the
almighty
power
creating
the
universe
and
placing
man
in
it
which
supposes
according
to
the
language
of
sir
john
herschel
the
eminent
astronomer
that
combinations
are
exhausted
upon
any
one
of
the
theatres
of
their
former
thus
far
we
know
not
the
law
of
the
series
which
governed
primeval
man
who
can
say
that
after
lapse
of
time
changes
did
not
occur
always
in
obedience
to
conditions
stamped
upon
him
at
the
creation
a
simpler
illustration
carries
us
to
the
same
result
a
so
common
in
machinery
operates
ordinarily
by
the
cogs
on
its
rim
but
the
wheel
may
be
so
constructed
that
after
a
certain
series
of
rotations
another
set
of
cogs
is
presented
inducing
a
different
motion
all
can
see
how
in
conformity
with
preëxisting
law
a
change
may
occur
in
the
operations
of
the
machine
but
it
was
not
less
easy
for
the
creator
to
fix
his
law
at
the
beginning
according
to
which
the
evolutions
of
this
world
proceed
and
thus
are
we
brought
back
to
the
conclusion
so
often
announced
that
unity
of
origin
must
not
be
set
aside
simply
because
existing
varieties
of
man
can
not
be
sufficiently
explained
by
known
laws
operating
during
that
brief
period
which
we
call
history
in
considering
this
great
question
there
are
authorities
which
can
not
be
disregarded
count
them
or
weigh
them
it
is
the
same
i
adduce
a
few
only
beginning
with
latham
the
ethnologist
who
insists
that
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
languages
of
the
surface
are
referable
to
one
common
origin
that
as
a
matter
of
logic
this
common
origin
of
language
is
evidence
of
a
common
origin
for
those
who
speak
the
great
french
geographer
and
circumnavigator
dumont
testifies
thus
see
on
the
whole
surface
of
the
globe
only
three
types
or
divisions
of
mankind
which
seem
to
me
to
merit
the
title
of
distinct
races
the
white
more
or
less
colored
with
red
the
yellow
inclining
to
different
tints
of
copper
or
bronze
and
the
i
share
in
the
opinion
which
refers
these
three
races
to
one
and
the
same
primitive
stock
and
which
places
their
common
cradle
on
the
central
plateau
of
buffon
the
brilliant
naturalist
whose
work
is
one
of
the
french
classics
thus
records
his
judgment
concurs
to
prove
that
the
human
race
is
not
composed
of
species
essentially
different
among
themselves
that
on
the
contrary
there
was
originally
but
a
single
species
of
men
who
in
multiplying
and
spreading
over
all
the
surface
of
the
globe
have
undergone
different
changes
through
the
influence
of
climate
difference
of
food
difference
in
the
manner
of
living
epidemic
maladies
and
the
infinitely
varied
intermixture
of
individuals
more
or
less
another
authority
avoiding
the
question
of
origin
has
given
a
summary
full
of
instruction
and
beauty
i
refer
to
alexander
von
humboldt
the
companion
of
every
science
to
whom
all
science
was
revealed
who
studied
man
in
both
hemispheres
and
ever
afterwards
throughout
his
long
and
glorious
career
continued
the
pursuit
adopting
the
words
of
the
great
german
anatomist
johannes
müller
that
different
races
of
mankind
are
forms
of
one
sole
species
by
the
union
of
two
individuals
of
which
descendants
are
propagated
and
criticizing
the
popular
classifications
of
blumenbach
and
prichard
as
wanting
or
principle
the
author
of
insists
that
distribution
of
mankind
is
only
a
distribution
into
which
are
commonly
designated
by
the
somewhat
indefinite
term
and
then
announces
the
grand
conclusion
we
maintain
the
unity
of
the
human
species
we
at
the
same
time
repel
the
depressing
assumption
of
superior
and
inferior
races
of
men
there
are
nations
more
susceptible
of
cultivation
more
highly
civilized
more
ennobled
by
mental
cultivation
than
others
none
in
themselves
nobler
than
such
is
the
testimony
of
science
by
one
of
its
greatest
masters
rarely
have
better
words
been
uttered
nor
should
it
be
said
longer
that
science
is
silent
humboldt
has
spoken
and
what
he
said
is
much
in
little
most
simple
but
most
comprehensive
for
while
asserting
the
unity
of
the
human
family
he
repels
that
disheartening
pretension
of
caste
which
i
insist
shall
find
no
place
in
our
political
system
through
him
science
is
enlisted
for
the
equal
rights
of
all
whatever
the
judgment
on
the
unity
of
origin
where
from
the
nature
of
the
case
there
can
be
no
final
human
testimony
it
is
a
source
of
infinite
consolation
that
we
can
anchor
to
that
other
unity
found
in
a
common
organization
a
common
nature
and
a
common
destiny
being
at
once
physical
moral
and
prophetic
this
is
the
true
unity
of
the
human
family
in
all
essentials
constituting
humanity
in
all
that
makes
man
all
varieties
of
the
human
species
are
one
and
the
same
there
is
no
real
difference
between
them
the
variance
whether
of
complexion
configuration
or
language
is
external
and
superficial
only
like
the
dress
we
wear
here
all
knowledge
and
every
science
concur

the
equal
promises
to
all
men

look
at
man
on
the

he

the
same
no

in
what

he

clad
same

same

same

same

same

look
at
man
in
the
world
and
you
will
find
him
in
nature
always
the
same
modified
only
by
the
civilization
about
him
there
is
no
human
being

as

do
we

if

do
we
not

look
at
man
in
his
destiny
here
or

so
far
as
it
can
be
penetrated
by
mortal
vision
and
who
will
venture
to
claim
for
any
variety
or

exclusive
prerogatives
on
earth
or
in

where
is
this
preposterous
pretender
god

all
the

longevity
marking
a

mortality
the
same
cosmopolitan
character
marking
citizenship
everywhere
and
the
same
capacity
for
improvement
marking
that
tendency
sometimes
called
the
perfectibility
of
the
race
and
he
has
given
to
all
alike
the
same
promise
of
immortal
life
by
these
tokens
is
man
known
everywhere
to
be
man
and
by
these
tokens
is
he
everywhere
entitled
to
the
rights
of
man
there
is
a
lesson
in
the
dog
is
there
not
who
does
not
admire
that
fidelity
which
makes
this
animal
ally
and
friend
of
man
following
him
over
the
whole
earth
in
every
climate
under
all
influences
of
sky
cosmopolitan
as
himself
in
prosperity
and
adversity
always
true
and
then
by
beautiful
fable
transported
to
another
world
where
the
association
of
life
is
prolonged
to
man
while
faithful
dog
shall
bear
him
the
dog
of
ulysses
dying
for
joy
at
his
return
when
all
ithaca
had
forgotten
the
lord
is
not
the
only
instance
but
who
has
heard
that
this
wonderful
instinct
makes
any
discrimination
of
manhood
it
is
to
man
that
the
dog
is
faithful
nor
does
it
matter
of
what
condition
whether
the
child
of
wealth
or
the
rough
shepherd
tending
his
flocks
nor
does
it
matter
of
what
complexion
whether
caucasian
white
or
ethiopian
black
or
mongolian
yellow
it
is
enough
that
the
master
is
man
and
thus
even
through
the
instincts
of
a
brute
does
nature
testify
to
that
unity
of
the
human
family
by
virtue
of
which
all
are
alike
in
rights
experts
in
ethnology
are
earnest
to
recognize
this
other
unity
on
which
i
now
insist
our
own
agassiz
who
is
the
most
illustrious
of
the
masters
not
accepting
the
unity
of
origin
is
careful
to
add
the
moral
question
of
brotherhood
among
is
not
affected
by
this
dissent
and
he
announces
unity
is
not
only
compatible
with
diversity
of
origin
but
that
it
is
the
universal
law
of
this
other
unity
found
an
eloquent
representative
in
william
von
humboldt
not
less
eminent
as
philologist
than
his
brother
as
naturalist
who
proclaims
our
common
humanity
to
be
the
dominant
idea
of
history
more
and
more
extending
its
empire
to
remove
the
barriers
which
prejudice
and
limited
views
of
every
kind
have
erected
amongst
men
and
to
treat
all
mankind
without
reference
to
religion
nation
or
color
as
one
fraternity
one
great
and
he
concludes
by
announcing
recognition
of
the
bond
of
as
of
the
noblest
leading
principles
in
the
history
of
and
these
grand
words
are
adopted
by
alexander
von
humboldt
so
that
the
philologist
and
the
naturalist
unite
in
this
cause
thus
in
every
direction
do
we
find
new
testimony
against
the
pretension
of
caste
we
are
told
that
little
learning
is
a
dangerous
if
this
be
ever
true
it
can
not
be
better
illustrated
than
by
that
sciolism
which
from
the
varieties
of
the
human
species
would
overthrow
that
sublime
unity
which
is
the
first
law
of
creation
as
well
overthrow
creation
itself
there
is
no
great
intelligence
which
does
not
witness
to
this
law
bacon
newton
leibnitz
descartes
all
testify
laplace
from
the
heights
of
his
knowledge
teaches
that
the
curve
described
by
a
simple
particle
of
air
or
vapor
is
regulated
by
a
law
as
certain
as
the
orbits
of
the
planets
and
is
not
man
the
equal
subject
of
certain
law
god
rejoices
in
unity
it
is
with
him
a
universal
law
applicable
to
all
above
and
below
from
the
sun
in
the
heavens
to
the
soul
of
man
not
one
law
for
one
group
of
stars
and
one
law
for
one
group
of
men
but
one
law
for
all
stars
and
one
law
for
all
men
the
saying
of
plato
that
geometrizes
is
only
another
expression
for
the
certainty
and
universality
of
this
law
aristotle
follows
plato
when
borrowing
an
illustration
from
the
requirements
of
the
greek
drama
he
announces
that
nature
nothing
is
unconnected
or
out
of
place
as
in
a
bad
but
caste
is
unconnected
and
out
of
place
it
is
a
perpetual
discord
a
prolonged
jar
contrary
to
the
first
principle
of
the
universe
only
when
we
consider
the
universality
of
the
moral
law
can
we
fully
appreciate
the
grandeur
of
this
unity
the
great
philosopher
of
germany
kant
declared
that
there
were
two
things
filling
him
always
with
admiration
the
starry
heavens
above
and
the
moral
law
within
well
might
the
two
be
joined
together
for
in
that
moral
law
with
a
home
in
every
bosom
is
a
vastness
and
beauty
commensurate
with
the
universe
every
human
being
carries
a
universe
in
himself
but
here
as
in
that
other
universe
is
the
same
prevailing
law
of
unity
in
harmony
with
which
the
starry
heavens
move
in
their
spheres
and
men
are
constrained
to
the
duties
of
life
the
stars
must
obey
so
must
men
this
obedience
brings
the
whole
human
family
into
harmony
with
each
other
and
also
with
the
creator
and
here
again
we
behold
the
grandeur
of
the
system
while
new
harmonies
unfold
religion
takes
up
the
lesson
and
the
daily
prayer
father
who
art
in
heaven
is
the
daily
witness
to
the
brotherhood
of
man
god
is
universal
father
then
are
we
all
brothers
if
not
all
children
of
adam
we
are
all
children
of
god
if
not
all
from
the
same
father
on
earth
we
are
all
from
the
same
father
in
heaven
and
this
affecting
relationship
which
knows
no
distinction
of
race
or
color
is
more
vital
and
ennobling
than
any
monopoly
here
once
more
is
that
universal
law
which
forbids
caste
speaking
not
only
with
the
voice
of
science
but
of
religion
also
praying
pleading
protesting
in
the
name
of
a
common
father
against
such
wrong
and
insult
to
our
brother
man
in
beautiful
harmony
are
those
words
of
promise
will
make
a
more
precious
than
fine
gold
even
a
man
than
the
golden
wedge
of
against
this
lofty
recognition
of
a
common
humanity
how
mean
the
pretension
of
caste
assuming
this
common
humanity
it
is
difficult
to
see
how
reason
can
resist
the
conclusion
that
in
the
lapse
of
time
there
must
be
a
common
universal
civilization
which
every
nation
and
every
people
will
share
none
too
low
none
too
inaccessible
for
its
kindred
embrace
amidst
the
differences
which
now
exist
and
in
the
contemplation
of
nations
and
peoples
infinitely
various
in
condition
with
the
barbarian
still
claiming
an
extensive
empire
with
the
savage
still
claiming
a
whole
continent
and
islands
of
the
sea
i
can
not
doubt
the
certain
triumph
of
this
great
law
believing
in
god
i
believe
also
in
man
through
whose
energies
all
this
will
be
accomplished
was
he
not
told
at
the
beginning
with
the
blessing
of
god
upon
him
fruitful
and
multiply
and
replenish
the
earth
and
subdue
all
of
which
i
am
sure
will
be
done
why
this
common
humanity
why
this
common
brotherhood
if
the
inheritance
is
for
brahmins
only
why
the
injunction
to
multiply
and
subdue
the
earth
if
there
are
to
be
sudras
and
pariahs
always
why
this
sublime
law
of
unity
holding
the
universe
in
its
grasp
if
man
alone
is
left
beyond
its
reach
i
have
already
founded
the
unity
of
the
human
family
partly
on
the
common
destiny
and
i
now
insist
that
this
common
destiny
is
attested
by
the
unquestionable
unity
of
the
human
family
they
are
parts
of
one
system
complements
of
each
other
why
this
unity
if
there
be
no
common
destiny
how
this
common
destiny
if
there
be
no
unity
assuming
the
unity
then
is
the
common
destiny
a
necessary
consequence
under
the
law
appointed
for
man
the
skeptic
is
disturbed
because
thus
far
in
our
brief
chronology
this
common
civilization
has
not
been
developed
but
to
my
mind
it
is
plain
that
much
has
been
done
making
the
rest
certain
through
the
same
incessant
influences
under
the
great
law
of
human
progress
that
european
civilization
which
has
already
pushed
its
conquests
in
every
quarter
of
the
globe
is
a
lesson
to
mankind
beginning
with
small
communities
it
has
proceeded
stage
by
stage
extending
to
larger
until
it
embraced
nations
and
distant
places
and
now
stamps
itself
ineffaceably
upon
increasing
multitudes
making
them
under
god
pioneers
in
the
grand
march
of
humanity
europe
had
her
dark
ages
when
there
was
a
night
with
visible
and
there
was
an
earlier
period
in
the
history
of
each
nation
when
man
was
not
less
savage
than
now
in
the
very
heart
of
africa
but
the
european
has
emerged
and
at
last
stands
in
a
world
of
light
take
any
of
the
nations
whose
development
belongs
to
modern
times
and
the
original
degradation
can
be
exhibited
in
authentic
colors
there
is
england
whose
present
civilization
is
in
many
respects
so
finished
but
when
the
conquering
cæsar
only
years
before
the
birth
of
christ
landed
on
this
unknown
island
her
people
were
painted
savages
with
a
cruel
religion
and
a
conjugal
system
which
was
an
incestuous
concubinage
his
authentic
report
places
this
condition
beyond
question
and
thus
knowing
her
original
degradation
and
her
present
transformation
after
eighteen
centuries
we
have
the
terms
for
a
question
in
the
rule
of
three
given
the
original
degradation
and
present
transformation
of
england
how
long
will
it
take
for
the
degradation
of
other
lands
to
experience
a
similar
transformation
add
also
present
agencies
of
civilization
to
which
england
was
for
centuries
a
stranger
this
instance
is
so
important
as
to
justify
details
when
britain
was
first
revealed
to
the
commercial
enterprise
of
tyre
her
people
according
to
macaulay
little
superior
to
the
natives
of
the
sandwich
the
historian
must
mean
when
those
islands
were
first
discovered
by
captain
cook
prichard
our
best
authority
supposes
them
on
a
level
with
the
or
tahitians
of
the
present
day
or
perhaps
not
very
superior
to
the
australians
which
is
very
low
indeed
there
was
but
little
change
if
any
when
they
became
known
to
the
romans
they
are
pictured
as
large
and
tall
excelling
the
gauls
in
stature
but
less
robust
and
according
to
the
geographer
strabo
with
crooked
legs
and
unshapely
figures
northward
were
the
caledonians
also
britons
tattooing
their
bodies
dwelling
in
tents
savage
in
manners
and
with
a
moral
degradation
kindred
to
that
of
the
southern
britons
across
the
channel
were
the
irish
whose
reported
condition
was
even
more
terrible
according
to
cæsar
most
in
the
interior
of
britain
never
sowed
corn
but
lived
on
milk
and
flesh
and
were
clad
in
skins
but
he
notes
that
all
colored
their
bodies
with
a
cerulean
dye
them
more
horrid
to
the
sight
in
and
he
then
relates
that
societies
of
ten
or
twelve
brothers
and
brothers
parents
and
children
had
wives
in
common
their
religious
observances
were
such
as
became
this
savage
life
here
was
the
sanctuary
of
the
druids
whose
absolute
and
peculiar
power
was
sustained
by
inhuman
rites
on
rude
but
terrible
altars
in
the
gloom
of
the
forest
human
victims
were
sacrificed
while
from
the
blood
as
it
coursed
under
the
knife
of
the
priest
there
was
a
divination
of
future
events
there
was
no
industry
and
no
production
except
slaves
too
illiterate
for
the
roman
market
imagination
pictured
strange
things
one
province
was
reported
where
ground
was
covered
with
serpents
and
the
air
was
such
that
no
man
could
inhale
it
and
in
the
polite
circles
of
the
empire
the
whole
region
excited
a
fearful
horror
which
has
been
aptly
likened
to
that
of
the
early
ionians
for
straits
of
scylla
and
the
city
of
the
læstrygonian
the
historian
records
with
a
sigh
that
magnificent
remains
of
latian
porches
and
aqueducts
are
to
be
here
that
writer
of
british
birth
is
reckoned
among
the
masters
of
latian
poetry
and
and
this
was
england
at
the
beginning
long
afterwards
when
centuries
had
intervened
the
savage
was
improved
into
the
barbarian
but
from
one
authentic
instance
learn
the
rest
the
trade
in
slaves
was
active
and
english
peddlers
bought
up
children
throughout
the
country
while
the
people
greedy
of
the
price
sold
their
own
relations
sometimes
their
own
offspring
in
similar
barbarism
all
jews
and
their
gains
were
the
absolute
property
of
the
king
and
this
law
beginning
with
edward
the
confessor
was
enforced
under
successive
monarchs
one
of
them
making
a
mortgage
of
all
jews
to
his
brother
as
security
for
a
debt
nothing
worse
is
now
said
of
africa
progress
was
slow
when
in
the
italian
æneas
sylvius
afterwards
pope
pius
the
second
visited
this
island
it
was
to
his
eyes
most
forlorn
houses
in
cities
were
in
large
part
built
without
lime
cottages
had
no
other
door
than
a
food
was
coarse
sometimes
in
place
of
bread
the
bark
of
trees
and
white
bread
was
such
a
rarity
among
the
people
as
to
be
a
curiosity
when
afterwards
under
henry
the
eighth
civilization
had
begun
the
condition
of
the
people
was
deplorable
there
was
no
such
thing
among
them
as
comfort
while
plague
and
prevailed
the
learned
and
ingenious
erasmus
who
was
an
honored
guest
in
england
at
this
time
refers
much
to
the
filthiness
of
the
houses
the
floors
he
describes
as
commonly
of
clay
strewn
with
rushes
in
the
renewal
of
which
those
at
the
bottom
sometimes
remained
undisturbed
for
twenty
years
retaining
filth
unmentionable
vomitus

non
i
quote
the
words
of
this
eminent
observer
the
traveller
from
the
interior
of
africa
would
hardly
make
a
worse
report
such
was
england
but
this
story
of
savagery
and
barbarism
is
not
peculiar
to
that
country
i
might
take
other
countries
one
by
one
and
exhibit
the
original
degradation
and
the
present
elevation
i
might
take
france
i
content
myself
with
one
instance
only
an
authentic
incident
of
french
history
recorded
by
a
contemporary
witness
and
associated
with
famous
names
in
the
last
century
shows
the
little
recognition
at
that
time
of
a
common
humanity
and
this
story
concerns
a
lady
remarkable
among
her
sex
for
various
talent
and
especially
as
a
mathematician
and
the
french
translator
of
newton
madame
duchâtelet
this
great
lady
the
friend
of
voltaire
found
no
difficulty
in
undressing
before
the
of
her
household
not
considering
it
that
such
persons
were
of
the
human
family
this
curious
revelation
of
manners
which
arrested
the
attention
of
de
tocqueville
in
his
remarkable
studies
on
the
origin
of
the
french
revolution
if
reported
from
africa
would
be
recognized
as
marking
a
most
perverse
barbarism
these
are
illustrations
only
which
might
be
multiplied
and
extended
indefinitely
but
they
are
sufficient
here
within
a
limited
sphere
obvious
to
all
is
the
operation
of
that
law
which
governs
universal
man
progress
here
prefigures
progress
everywhere
nay
progress
here
is
the
first
stage
in
the
progress
nobody
doubts
the
progress
of
england
nobody
doubts
the
progress
of
france
nobody
doubts
the
progress
of
the
european
family
wherever
distributed
in
all
quarters
of
the
globe
but
must
not
the
same
law
under
which
these
have
been
elevated
exert
its
equal
influence
on
the
whole
family
of
man
is
it
not
with
people
as
with
individuals
some
arrive
early
others
tardily
who
has
not
observed
that
independently
of
original
endowment
the
progress
of
the
individual
depends
upon
the
influences
about
him
surrounded
by
opportunity
and
trained
with
care
he
grows
into
the
type
of
civilized
man
but
on
the
other
hand
shut
out
from
opportunity
and
neglected
by
the
world
he
remains
stationary
always
a
man
entitled
from
his
manhood
to
equal
rights
but
an
example
of
inferiority
if
not
of
degradation
unquestionably
it
is
the
same
with
a
people
here
again
opportunity
and
a
training
hand
are
needed
to
the
inquiry
how
is
this
destiny
to
be
accomplished
i
answer
simply
by
recognizing
the
law
of
unity
and
acting
accordingly
the
law
is
plain
obey
it
let
each
people
obey
the
law
at
home
its
extension
abroad
will
follow
the
standard
at
home
will
become
the
standard
everywhere
the
harmony
at
home
will
become
the
harmony
of
mankind
drive
caste
from
this
republic
and
it
will
be
like
cain
fugitive
and
a
vagabond
in
the
therefore
do
i
now
plead
for
our
common
humanity
in
all
lands
especially
do
i
plead
for
the
african
not
only
among
us
but
in
his
own
vast
mysterious
home
where
for
unknown
centuries
he
has
been
the
prey
of
the
spoiler
he
may
be
barbarous
perhaps
savage
but
so
have
others
been
who
are
now
in
the
full
enjoyment
of
civilization
if
you
are
above
him
in
any
respect
then
by
your
superiority
are
you
bound
to
be
his
helper
where
much
is
given
much
is
required
and
this
is
the
law
for
a
nation
as
for
an
individual
the
unhappy
condition
of
africa
a
stranger
to
civilization
is
often
invoked
against
a
common
humanity
here
again
is
that
sciolism
which
is
the
inseparable
ally
of
every
ignoble
pretension
it
is
easy
to
explain
this
condition
without
yielding
to
a
theory
inconsistent
with
providence
the
key
is
found
in
her
geographical
character
affording
few
facilities
for
intercommunication
abroad
or
at
home
ocean
and
river
are
the
natural
allies
of
civilization
as
england
will
attest
for
such
was
their
early
influence
that
cæsar
on
landing
remarked
the
superior
condition
of
the
people
on
the
coast
europe
indented
by
seas
on
the
south
and
north
and
penetrated
by
considerable
rivers
will
attest
also
the
great
geographer
carl
ritter
who
has
placed
the
whole
globe
in
the
illumination
of
geographical
science
shows
that
the
relation
of
interior
spaces
to
the
extent
of
coast
has
a
measurable
influence
on
civilization
and
here
is
the
secret
of
africa
while
all
asia
is
five
times
as
large
as
europe
and
africa
more
than
three
times
as
large
the
littoral
margins
have
a
different
proportion
asia
has
miles
of
coast
europe
and
africa
only
for
every
square
miles
of
the
european
continent
there
is
one
mile
of
coast
while
in
africa
one
mile
of
coast
corresponds
to
square
miles
of
continent
the
relative
extension
of
coast
in
europe
is
four
times
greater
than
in
africa
asia
is
in
the
middle
between
the
two
extremes
having
for
every
square
miles
one
mile
of
coast
and
so
also
is
asia
between
the
two
in
civilization
there
is
still
another
difference
with
corresponding
advantage
to
europe
one
third
part
of
europe
is
in
the
nature
of
ramification
from
the
mass
furnishing
additional
opportunities
whereas
africa
is
a
solid
impenetrable
continent
without
ramifications
without
opening
gulfs
or
navigable
rivers
except
the
nile
which
once
witnessed
the
famous
egyptian
civilization
and
now
in
addition
to
all
these
opportunities
by
water
europe
has
others
not
less
important
from
a
reticulation
of
railways
bringing
all
parts
together
while
africa
is
without
these
civilizers
all
these
things
are
apparent
and
beyond
question
nor
can
their
influence
be
doubted
and
thus
is
the
condition
of
africa
explained
without
an
insult
to
her
people
or
any
new
apology
for
caste
the
attempt
to
disparage
the
african
as
inferior
to
other
men
except
in
present
condition
shows
that
same
sciolism
does
humboldt
repel
the
assumption
of
superiority
and
beautifully
insist
that
no
people
are
themselves
nobler
than
then
all
are
men
all
are
brothers
of
the
same
human
family
with
superficial
and
transitional
differences
only
plainly
no
differences
can
make
one
color
superior
to
another
and
looking
carefully
at
the
african
in
the
seclusion
and
isolation
of
his
native
home
we
see
sufficient
reason
for
that
condition
which
is
the
chief
argument
against
him
it
is
doubtful
if
any
people
has
become
civilized
without
extraneous
help
britain
was
savage
when
roman
civilization
intervened
so
was
gaul
cadmus
brought
letters
to
greece
and
what
is
the
story
of
prometheus
who
stole
fire
from
heaven
but
an
illustration
of
this
law
the
african
has
not
stolen
fire
no
cadmus
has
brought
letters
to
him
no
roman
civilization
has
been
extended
over
his
continent
meanwhile
left
to
savage
life
he
has
been
a
perpetual
victim
hunted
down
at
home
to
feed
the
bloody
maw
of
slavery
and
then
transported
to
another
hemisphere
always
a
slave
in
such
condition
nature
has
had
small
opportunity
for
development
no
kindly
influences
have
surrounded
his
home
no
voice
of
encouragement
has
cheered
his
path
no
prospect
of
trust
or
honor
has
awakened
his
ambition
his
life
has
been
a
dead
sea
where
apples
of
sodom
floated
and
yet
his
story
is
not
without
passages
which
quicken
admiration
and
give
assurance
for
the
future
at
times
melting
to
tenderness
and
at
times
inspiring
to
rage
that
these
children
of
god
with
so
much
of
his
best
gifts
should
be
so
wronged
by
their
brother
man
the
ancient
poet
tells
us
that
there
were
heroes
before
agamemnon
that
is
before
the
poet
came
to
praise
who
knows
the
heroes
of
those
vast
unvisited
recesses
where
there
is
no
history
and
only
tradition
but
among
those
transported
to
this
hemisphere
heroes
have
not
been
wanting
nowhere
in
history
was
the
heroical
character
more
conspicuous
than
in
our
fugitive
slaves
their
story
transferred
to
greece
or
rome
would
be
a
chapter
from
which
youth
would
derive
new
passion
for
liberty
the
story
of
the
african
in
our
late
war
would
be
another
chapter
awakening
kindred
emotion
but
it
is
in
a
slave
of
the
west
indies
whose
parents
were
stolen
from
africa
that
we
find
an
example
of
genius
and
wisdom
courage
and
character
with
all
the
elements
of
general
and
ruler
the
name
borne
by
this
remarkable
person
as
slave
was
toussaint
but
his
success
in
forcing
an
everywhere
secured
for
him
the
addition
of
making
his
name
toussaint
toussaint
by
which
he
takes
his
place
in
history
he
was
opener
for
his
people
whom
he
advanced
from
slavery
to
freedom
and
then
sank
under
the
power
of
napoleon
who
sent
an
army
and
fleet
to
subdue
him
more
than
agamemnon
or
any
chief
before
troy
more
than
spartacus
the
renowned
leader
of
the
servile
insurrection
which
made
rome
tremble
he
was
a
hero
endowed
with
a
higher
nature
and
better
faculties
but
he
was
an
african
jet
black
in
complexion
the
height
that
he
reached
is
the
measure
of
his
people
call
it
mark
if
you
will
but
this
is
the
true
line
for
judgment
and
not
the
mark
of
slavery
which
is
always
adopted
by
the
apologists
for
caste
toussaint
is
the
actual
standard
by
which
the
african
must
be
judged
when
studied
where
he
is
chiefly
seen
not
in
the
affairs
of
government
but
in
daily
life
the
african
awakens
attachment
and
respect
the
will
of
upshur
secretary
of
state
under
president
tyler
describes
a
typical
character
here
are
the
remarkable
words
emancipate
and
set
free
my
servant
david
rich
and
direct
my
executors
to
give
him
hundred
i
recommend
him
in
the
strongest
manner
to
the
respect
esteem
and
confidence
of
any
community
in
which
he
may
happen
to
live
he
has
been
my
slave
for
years
during
which
time
he
has
been
trusted
to
every
extent
and
in
every
respect
my
confidence
in
him
has
been
unbounded
his
relation
to
myself
and
family
has
always
been
such
as
to
afford
him
daily
opportunities
to
deceive
and
injure
us
and
yet
he
has
never
been
detected
in
a
serious
fault
nor
even
in
an
intentional
breach
of
the
decorums
of
his
station
his
intelligence
is
of
a
high
order
his
integrity
above
all
suspicion
and
his
sense
of
right
and
propriety
always
correct
and
even
delicate
and
refined
i
feel
that
he
is
justly
entitled
to
carry
this
certificate
from
me
into
the
new
relations
which
he
now
must
form
it
is
due
to
his
long
and
most
faithful
services
and
to
the
sincere
and
steady
friendship
which
i
bear
him
in
the
uninterrupted
and
confidential
intercourse
of
years
i
have
never
given
nor
had
occasion
to
give
him
an
unpleasant
word
i
know
no
man
who
has
fewer
faults
or
more
excellences
than
the
man
thus
portrayed
was
an
african
whose
only
school
was
slavery
here
again
is
the
standard
of
this
people
nor
is
there
failure
in
loftiness
of
character
with
heroism
more
beautiful
than
that
of
mutius
scævola
a
slave
in
louisiana
as
long
ago
as
being
compelled
to
be
executioner
cut
off
his
right
hand
with
an
axe
that
he
might
avoid
taking
the
life
of
his
brother
slave
the
apologist
for
caste
will
be
astonished
to
know
but
it
is
none
the
less
true
that
the
capacity
of
the
african
in
scholarship
and
science
is
better
attested
than
that
of
anybody
claiming
to
be
his
master
what
modern
has
taught
the
latin
like
juan
latino
at
seville
in
spain
written
it
like
capitein
at
the
hague
or
williams
at
jamaica
gained
academic
honors
like
those
accorded
to
amo
by
the
university
of
wittenberg
what
modern
has
equalled
in
science
banneker
of
maryland
who
in
his
admirable
letter
to
jefferson
avows
himself
the
african
race
and
in
that
color
which
is
natural
to
them
of
the
deepest
these
instances
are
all
from
the
admirable
work
of
the
good
bishop
grégoire
la
littérature
des
recent
experience
attests
the
singular
aptitude
of
the
african
for
knowledge
and
his
delight
in
its
acquisition
nor
is
there
any
doubt
of
his
delight
in
doing
good
the
beneficent
system
of
sunday
schools
in
new
york
is
traced
to
an
african
woman
who
first
attempted
this
work
and
her
school
was
for
all
alike
without
distinction
of
color
to
the
unquestionable
capacity
of
the
african
must
be
added
simplicity
amenity
generosity
fidelity
mahometans
who
know
him
well
recognize
his
superior
fidelity
and
such
also
is
the
report
of
travellers
not
besotted
by
slavery
from
mungo
park
to
livingstone
who
testify
also
to
tenderness
for
parents
respect
for
the
aged
hospitality
and
patriarchal
virtues
reviving
the
traditions
of
primitive
life
me
but
do
not
curse
my
mother
said
an
african
slave
to
his
master
and
leo
africanus
the
early
traveller
describes
a
chief
at
timbuctoo
black
in
complexion
but
most
fair
in
mind
and
others
dwell
on
his
christian
character
and
especially
his
susceptibility
to
those
influences
which
are
peculiarly
christian
so
that
saint
bernard
could
say
of
him
nigredo
quæ
mentis
candorem
of
all
people
he
is
the
mildest
and
most
sympathetic
hate
is
a
plant
of
difficult
growth
in
his
bosom
how
often
has
he
returned
the
harshness
of
his
master
with
care
and
protection
the
african
more
than
the
european
is
formed
by
nature
for
the
christian
graces
it
is
easy
to
picture
another
age
when
the
virtues
which
ennoble
the
african
will
return
to
bless
the
people
who
now
discredit
him
and
christianity
will
receive
a
new
development
in
the
providence
of
god
the
more
precocious
and
harder
nature
of
the
north
is
called
to
make
the
first
advance
civilization
begins
through
knowledge
an
active
intelligence
performs
the
part
of
opening
the
way
but
it
may
be
according
to
the
same
providence
that
the
gentler
people
elevated
in
knowledge
will
teach
their
teachers
what
knowledge
alone
can
not
impart
and
the
african
shall
more
than
repay
all
that
he
receives
the
pioneer
intelligence
of
europe
going
to
blend
with
the
gentleness
of
africa
will
be
a
blessed
sight
but
not
more
blessed
than
the
gentleness
of
africa
returning
to
blend
with
that
same
intelligence
at
home
under
such
combined
influences
men
will
not
only
know
and
do
but
they
will
feel
also
so
that
knowledge
in
all
its
departments
and
life
in
all
its
activities
will
have
the
triumphant
inspiration
of
human
brotherhood
in
this
work
there
is
no
room
for
prejudice
timidity
or
despair
reason
courage
and
hope
are
our
allies
while
the
bountiful
agencies
of
civilization
open
the
way
time
and
space
ancient
tyrants
keeping
people
apart
are
now
overcome
there
is
nothing
of
aspiration
for
universal
man
which
is
not
within
the
reach
of
effort
no
matter
in
what
unknown
recess
of
continent
no
matter
on
what
distant
island
of
the
sea
wherever
man
exists
there
are
the
capacities
of
manhood
with
that
greatest
of
all
the
capacity
for
improvement
and
the
civilization
we
have
reached
supplies
the
means
as
in
determining
the
function
of
government
so
here
again
is
the
necessity
of
knowledge
man
must
know
himself
and
that
law
of
unity
appointed
for
the
human
family
such
is
the
true
light
for
our
steps
here
are
guidance
and
safety
who
can
measure
the
value
of
knowledge
what
imagination
can
grasp
its
infinite
power
as
well
measure
the
sun
in
its
glory
the
friendly
lamp
in
our
streets
is
more
than
the
police
light
in
the
world
is
more
than
armies
or
navies
where
its
rays
penetrate
there
has
civilization
begun
not
the
earth
but
the
sun
is
the
centre
of
our
system
and
the
effulgence
in
which
we
live
and
move
symbolizes
that
other
effulgence
which
is
found
in
knowledge
great
powers
are
at
hand
ministers
of
human
progress
i
name
two
only
first
the
and
secondly
the
means
of
intercommunication
whether
by
navigation
or
railways
represented
by
the
by
these
civilization
is
extended
and
secured
it
is
not
only
carried
forward
but
fixed
so
that
there
can
be
no
return
like
the
wheel
of
an
alpine
railway
which
can
not
fall
back
every
rotation
is
a
sure
advance
here
is
what
greece
and
rome
never
knew
and
more
than
greece
and
rome
have
contributed
to
man
by
the
side
of
these
two
simple
agencies
how
small
all
that
has
come
to
us
from
these
two
politest
nations
of
antiquity
we
can
better
spare
greece
and
rome
than
the
and
not
a
triumph
in
literature
art
or
jurisprudence
from
the
story
of
homer
and
the
odes
of
horace
to
the
statue
of
apollo
and
the
bust
of
augustus
from
the
eloquence
of
demosthenes
and
cicero
to
that
roman
law
which
has
become
the
law
of
the
world
that
must
not
yield
in
value
to
these
two
immeasurable
possessions
to
the
and
add
now
their
youthful
handmaid
the
electric
telegraph
whose
swift
and
delicate
fingers
weave
the
thread
by
which
nations
are
brought
into
instant
communion
while
great
cities
like
london
and
paris
new
york
and
san
francisco
become
suburbs
to
each
other
and
all
mankind
feel
together
the
throb
of
joy
or
sorrow
through
these
incomparable
agencies
is
knowledge
made
coextensive
with
space
and
time
on
earth
no
distance
of
place
or
epoch
it
will
not
pervade
thus
every
achievement
in
thought
or
science
every
discovery
by
which
man
is
elevated
becomes
the
common
property
of
the
whole
human
family
there
can
be
no
monopoly
sooner
or
later
all
enjoy
the
triumph
standing
on
the
shoulders
of
the
past
man
stands
also
on
the
shoulders
of
every
science
discovered
every
art
advanced
every
truth
declared
there
is
no
height
of
culture
or
of
virtue
if
virtue
itself
be
not
the
highest
culture
which
may
not
be
reached
there
is
no
excellence
of
government
or
society
which
may
not
be
grasped
where
is
the
where
the
goal
one
obstacle
is
overcome
only
to
find
another
which
is
overcome
and
then
another
also
in
the
ascending
scale
of
human
improvement
and
then
shall
be
fulfilled
the
great
words
of
prophecy
which
men
have
read
so
long
with
hope
darkened
by
despair
earth
shall
be
full
of
the
knowledge
of
the
lord
as
the
waters
cover
the
shall
come
that
i
will
gather
all
nations
and
tongues
and
they
shall
come
and
see
my
the
promises
of
christianity
in
harmony
with
the
promises
of
science
and
more
beautiful
still
will
become
the
realities
of
earth
and
that
precious
example
wherein
is
the
way
of
life
will
be
another
sun
for
guidance
and
safety
the
question
is
followed
by
that
other
question
the
answer
is
easy
not
at
once
not
by
any
sudden
conquest
not
in
the
lifetime
of
any
individual
man
not
in
any
way
which
does
not
recognize
nature
as
it
is
by
constant
incessant
unceasing
activity
in
conformity
with
law
that
nature
works
and
so
in
these
operations
man
can
be
successful
only
in
harmony
with
nature
because
in
our
brief
pilgrimage
we
are
not
permitted
to
witness
the
transcendent
glory
it
is
none
the
less
certain
the
peaceful
conquest
will
proceed
and
every
day
must
contribute
its
fruits
at
the
beginning
of
the
last
century
russia
was
a
barbarous
country
shut
out
from
opportunities
of
improvement
authentic
report
attests
its
condition
through
contact
with
europe
it
was
vitalized
the
principle
circulated
and
this
vast
empire
felt
the
change
exposed
to
european
contact
at
one
point
only
here
the
influence
began
but
the
native
energies
of
the
people
under
the
guidance
of
a
powerful
ruler
responded
to
this
influence
and
russia
came
within
the
widening
circle
of
european
civilization
why
may
not
this
experience
be
repeated
elsewhere
and
distant
places
feel
the
same
beneficent
power
to
help
in
this
work
it
is
not
necessary
to
be
emperor
or
king
everybody
can
do
something
for
to
everybody
is
given
something
to
do
and
it
is
by
this
accumulation
of
activities
by
this
succession
of
atoms
that
the
result
is
accomplished
i
use
trivial
illustrations
when
i
remind
you
that
the
on
which
navies
are
wrecked
is
the
work
of
the
multitudinous
insect
that
the
unyielding
stone
is
worn
away
by
drops
but
this
is
the
law
of
nature
under
which
no
influence
is
lost
water
and
air
both
testify
to
the
slightest
movement
not
a
ripple
stirred
by
the
passing
breeze
or
by
the
freighted
ship
cleaving
the
sea
which
is
not
prolonged
to
a
thousand
shores
leaving
behind
an
endless
progeny
so
long
as
ocean
endures
not
a
wave
of
air
set
in
motion
by
the
human
voice
which
is
not
prolonged
likewise
into
unknown
space
but
these
watery
and
aërial
pulses
typify
the
acts
of
man
not
a
thing
done
not
a
word
said
which
does
not
help
or
hinder
the
grand
the
beautiful
the
holy
consummation
and
the
influence
is
in
proportion
to
the
individual
or
nation
from
whom
it
proceeds
god
forbid
that
our
nation
should
send
through
all
time
that
defiance
of
human
nature
which
is
found
in
caste
there
are
two
passages
of
the
new
testament
which
are
to
me
of
infinite
significance
we
read
them
often
perhaps
without
comprehending
their
value
the
first
is
with
regard
to
leaven
when
the
saviour
said
kingdom
of
heaven
is
like
unto
and
then
saint
paul
taking
up
the
image
on
two
different
occasions
repeats
little
leaven
leaveneth
the
whole
in
this
homely
illustration
we
see
what
is
accomplished
by
a
small
influence
a
little
changes
all
here
again
are
the
acts
of
man
typified
all
that
we
do
is
leaven
all
that
our
country
does
is
leaven
everybody
in
his
sphere
contributes
leaven
and
helps
his
country
to
contribute
that
mighty
leaven
which
will
leaven
the
whole
mighty
lump
the
other
passage
difficult
to
childhood
though
afterwards
recognized
as
a
faithful
record
of
human
experience
is
where
we
are
told
whosoever
hath
to
him
shall
be
given
and
he
shall
have
more
here
to
me
is
a
new
incentive
to
duty
because
the
world
inclines
to
those
who
have
therefore
must
we
study
to
serve
those
who
have
not
that
we
may
counteract
the
worldly
tendency
give
to
the
poor
and
lowly
give
to
the
outcast
give
to
those
degraded
by
their
that
they
may
be
elevated
in
the
scale
of
humanity
assured
that
what
we
give
is
not
only
valuable
in
itself
but
the
beginning
of
other
acquisitions
that
the
knowledge
we
convey
makes
other
knowledge
easy
that
the
right
we
recognize
helps
to
secure
all
the
rights
of
man
give
to
the
african
only
his
due
and
straightway
the
promised
abundance
will
follow
in
leaving
this
question
which
i
have
opened
to
you
so
imperfectly
i
am
impressed
anew
with
its
grandeur
the
best
interests
of
our
country
and
the
best
interests
of
mankind
are
involved
in
the
answer
let
caste
prevail
and
civilization
is
thwarted
let
caste
be
trampled
out
and
there
will
be
a
triumph
which
will
make
this
republic
more
than
ever
an
example
the
good
influence
will
extend
in
prolonged
pulsations
reaching
the
most
distant
shores
not
a
land
which
will
not
feel
the
spread
just
in
proportion
to
its
necessities
above
all
africa
will
feel
it
and
the
surpassing
duty
which
civilization
owes
to
this
whole
continent
where
man
has
so
long
degraded
his
will
begin
to
be
discharged
while
the
voice
of
the
great
shepherd
is
heard
among
its
people
in
the
large
interests
beyond
i
would
not
lose
sight
of
the
practical
interests
at
home
it
is
important
for
our
domestic
peace
not
to
speak
of
our
good
name
as
a
republic
that
this
question
should
be
settled
long
enough
has
its
shadow
rested
upon
us
and
now
it
lowers
from
an
opposite
quarter
how
often
have
i
said
in
other
places
that
nothing
can
be
settled
which
is
not
right
and
now
i
say
that
there
can
be
no
settlement
here
except
in
harmony
with
our
declared
principles
and
with
universal
truth
to
this
end
caste
must
be
forbidden
for
i
am
black
said
othello
for
i
am
yellow
repeats
the
chinese
all
of
which
may
be
ground
for
personal
like
or
dislike
but
not
for
any
denial
of
rights
or
any
exclusion
from
that
equal
copartnership
which
is
the
promise
of
the
republic
to
all
men
here
as
always
the
highest
safety
is
in
doing
right
justice
is
ever
practical
ever
politic
it
is
the
best
practice
the
best
policy
whatever
reason
shows
to
be
just
can
not
when
reduced
to
practice
produce
other
than
good
and
now
i
simply
ask
you
to
be
just
to
those
who
find
peril
in
the
growing
multitudes
admitted
to
citizenship
i
reply
that
our
republic
assumed
these
responsibilities
when
it
declared
the
equal
rights
of
all
men
and
that
just
government
stands
only
on
the
consent
of
the
governed
hospitality
of
citizenship
is
the
law
of
its
being
this
is
its
great
first
principle
this
is
the
talisman
of
its
empire
would
you
conquer
nature
follow
nature
and
here
would
you
conquer
physical
diversities
follow
that
moral
law
declared
by
our
fathers
which
is
the
highest
law
of
nature
and
supreme
above
all
men
welcome
then
to
the
stranger
hurrying
from
opposite
shores
across
two
great
oceans
from
the
east
from
the
west
with
the
sun
against
the
sun
here
he
can
not
be
stranger
if
the
chinese
come
for
labor
only
we
have
the
advantage
of
their
wonderful
and
docile
industry
if
they
come
for
citizenship
then
do
they
offer
the
pledge
of
incorporation
in
our
republic
filling
it
with
increase
nor
is
there
peril
in
the
gifts
they
bring
as
all
rivers
are
lost
in
the
sea
which
shows
no
sign
of
their
presence
so
will
all
peoples
be
lost
in
the
widening
confines
of
our
republic
with
an
continent
for
its
unparalleled
expanse
and
one
harmonious
citizenship
where
all
are
equal
in
rights
for
its
gentle
and
impartial
sway
currency
remarks
in
the
senate
on
introducing
a
bill
to
amend
the
banking
act
and
to
promote
the
return
to
specie
payments
december
the
bill
having
been
read
twice
by
its
title
sumner
said
at
the
proper
time
i
shall
ask
the
reference
of
this
bill
to
the
committee
on
finance
and
if
i
can
have
the
attention
of
my
honorable
friend
the
chairman
of
that
committee
sherman
i
should
like
now
as
i
have
ventured
to
introduce
the
bill
to
specify
for
his
consideration
seven
different
reasons
in
favor
of
it
it
will
take
me
only
one
minute
sherman
i
should
like
to
have
the
bill
read
if
the
senator
has
no
objection
the
secretary
accordingly
read
the
bill
in
full
as
follows
it
enacted
that
so
much
of
the
banking
act
as
limits
the
issue
of
bills
to
is
hereby
repealed
and
existing
banks
may
be
enlarged
and
new
banks
may
be
organized
at
the
discretion
of
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
but
no
more
bills
than
are
now
authorized
by
the
banking
act
shall
hereafter
be
issued
unless
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
at
the
time
of
their
issue
can
and
does
cancel
and
destroy
a
like
amount
of
and
the
increase
of
hereby
authorized
shall
not
exceed
a
year
which
amount
shall
be
so
distributed
by
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
as
to
equalize
as
near
as
possible
the
banking
interest
of
the
different
states
sumner
now
president
i
wish
at
this
moment
merely
to
indicate
the
reasons
in
favor
of
that
proposition
it
will
create
a
demand
for
national
bonds
and
to
this
extent
fortify
the
national
credit
it
will
tend
to
satisfy
those
parts
of
the
country
especially
at
the
south
and
west
where
currency
and
banks
are
wanting
and
thus
arrest
a
difficult
question
it
will
not
expand
or
contract
the
currency
so
that
the
opposite
parties
on
these
questions
may
support
it
under
it
the
banks
will
gradually
strengthen
themselves
and
prepare
to
resume
specie
payments
it
will
give
the
south
and
west
the
opportunity
to
organize
banks
and
will
interest
those
parts
of
the
country
to
this
extent
in
the
national
securities
and
the
national
banking
system
by
which
both
will
be
strengthened
it
will
within
a
reasonable
time
relieve
the
country
of
the
whole
greenback
system
and
thus
dispose
of
an
important
question
it
will
hasten
the
return
to
specie
payments
now
i
believe
every
one
of
these
reasons
is
valid
and
i
commend
them
to
my
excellent
friend
from
ohio
the
bill
was
then
laid
on
the
table
and
ordered
to
be
printed
colored
physicians
resolution
and
remarks
in
the
senate
on
the
exclusion
of
colored
physicians
from
the
medical
society
of
the
district
of
columbia
december
i
offer
the
following
resolution
and
ask
for
its
immediate
consideration
that
the
committee
on
the
district
of
columbia
be
directed
to
consider
the
expediency
of
repealing
the
charter
of
the
medical
society
of
the
district
of
columbia
and
of
such
other
legislation
as
may
be
necessary
in
order
to
secure
for
medical
practitioners
in
the
district
of
columbia
equal
rights
and
opportunities
without
distinction
of
color
i
hope
there
can
be
no
objection
to
this
proposition
which
has
become
necessary
from
a
recent
incident
a
medical
practitioner
in
washington
augusta
who
had
served
as
a
surgeon
in
the
army
of
the
united
states
and
was
brevetted
as
a
who
had
enjoyed
office
and
honor
under
the
national
government
has
been
excluded
from
the
medical
society
of
the
district
of
columbia
on
that
old
reason
so
often
and
persistently
urged
merely
of
color
it
is
true
that
augusta
is
guilty
of
a
skin
which
is
a
shade
different
from
that
prevailing
in
the
medical
society
but
nobody
can
impeach
his
character
or
his
professional
position
purvis
another
practitioner
obnoxious
only
from
the
skin
was
excluded
at
the
same
time
there
is
no
doubt
that
this
was
accomplished
by
an
organized
effort
quickened
by
this
exclusion
besides
its
stigma
on
a
race
is
a
practical
injury
to
these
gentlemen
and
to
their
patients
also
who
are
thus
shut
out
from
valuable
opportunities
and
advantages
by
a
rule
of
the
medical
society
member
of
this
association
shall
consult
with
or
meet
in
a
professional
way
any
resident
practitioner
of
the
district
who
is
not
a
member
thereof
after
said
practitioner
shall
have
resided
six
months
in
said
thus
do
members
of
the
society
constitute
themselves
a
medical
oligarchy
when
asked
to
consult
with
augusta
some
of
them
have
replied
would
like
to
consult
with
augusta
we
believe
him
to
be
a
good
doctor
but
he
does
not
belong
to
our
society
and
therefore
we
must
decline
but
we
will
take
charge
of
the
and
this
has
been
sometimes
done
is
not
this
a
hardship
should
it
be
allowed
to
exist
details
illustrate
still
further
the
character
of
this
wrong
these
colored
practitioners
are
licensed
like
members
of
the
society
but
this
license
does
not
give
them
the
privilege
of
attending
the
meetings
of
the
society
where
medical
and
surgical
subjects
are
discussed
and
where
peculiar
and
interesting
cases
with
their
appropriate
treatment
are
communicated
for
the
benefit
of
the
profession
so
that
they
are
shut
out
from
this
interesting
source
of
information
which
is
like
a
constant
education
and
also
from
the
opportunity
of
submitting
the
cases
in
their
own
practice
i
confess
sir
that
i
can
not
think
of
the
medical
profession
at
the
national
capital
engaged
in
this
warfare
on
their
colored
brethren
without
sentiments
which
it
is
difficult
to
restrain
their
conduct
in
its
direct
effect
degrades
a
and
deeply
injured
race
but
it
also
degrades
themselves
nobody
can
do
such
a
meanness
without
degradation
in
my
opinion
these
white
oligarchs
ought
to
have
notice
and
i
give
them
notice
now
that
this
outrage
shall
not
be
allowed
to
continue
without
remedy
if
i
can
obtain
it
through
congress
the
time
has
passed
for
any
such
pretension
i
hope
sir
there
can
be
no
objection
to
the
resolution
it
ought
to
pass
unanimously
who
will
array
himself
on
the
side
of
this
wrong
the
resolution
was
agreed
to
and
the
committee
proceeded
to
a
full
investigation
of
which
they
made
extended
report
accompanied
by
a
bill
for
the
repeal
of
the
charter
but
adverse
influence
continued
through
two
sessions
to
the
expiration
of
the
congress
succeeded
in
preventing
action
the
late
hon
william
pitt
fessenden
senator
of
maine
remarks
in
the
senate
on
his
death
december
president
a
seat
in
this
chamber
is
vacant
but
this
is
a
very
inadequate
expression
for
the
present
occasion
much
more
than
a
seat
is
vacant
there
is
a
void
difficult
to
measure
as
it
will
be
difficult
to
fill
always
eminent
from
the
beginning
fessenden
during
these
latter
years
became
so
large
a
part
of
the
senate
that
without
him
it
seems
to
be
a
different
body
his
guiding
judgment
his
ready
power
his
presence
so
conspicuous
in
debate
are
gone
taking
away
from
this
chamber
that
identity
which
it
received
so
considerably
from
him
of
all
the
present
senate
one
only
besides
myself
witnessed
his
entry
into
this
chamber
i
can
not
forget
it
he
came
in
the
midst
of
that
terrible
debate
on
the
kansas
and
nebraska
bill
by
which
the
country
was
convulsed
to
its
centre
and
his
arrival
had
the
effect
of
a
reinforcement
on
a
field
of
battle
those
who
stood
for
freedom
then
were
few
in
numbers
not
more
than
fourteen
while
senators
in
solid
column
voted
to
break
the
faith
originally
plighted
to
freedom
and
to
overturn
a
landmark
opening
that
vast
mesopotamian
region
to
the
curse
of
slavery
those
anxious
days
are
with
difficulty
comprehended
by
a
senate
where
freedom
rules
one
more
in
our
small
number
was
a
sensible
addition
we
were
no
longer
fourteen
but
fifteen
his
reputation
at
the
bar
and
his
fame
in
the
other
house
gave
assurance
which
was
promptly
sustained
he
did
not
wait
but
at
once
entered
into
the
debate
with
all
those
resources
which
afterwards
became
so
famous
the
scene
that
ensued
exhibited
his
readiness
and
courage
while
saying
that
the
people
of
the
north
were
fatigued
with
the
threat
of
disunion
that
they
considered
it
as
noise
and
nothing
else
he
was
interrupted
by
butler
of
south
carolina
always
ready
to
speak
for
slavery
exclaiming
such
sentiments
as
yours
prevail
i
want
a
dissolution
right
away
a
characteristic
intrusion
doubly
out
of
order
to
which
the
rejoined
not
delay
it
on
my
account
do
not
delay
it
on
account
of
anybody
at
the
the
effect
was
electric
but
this
instance
was
not
alone
douglas
cass
and
butler
interrupted
only
to
be
worsted
by
one
who
had
just
ridden
into
the
lists
the
feelings
of
the
other
side
were
expressed
by
the
senator
from
south
carolina
who
after
one
of
the
flashes
of
debate
which
he
had
provoked
exclaimed
well
go
on
i
have
no
hope
for
all
this
will
be
found
in
the
precisely
as
i
give
it
but
the
could
not
picture
the
exciting
scene
the
senator
from
maine
erect
firm
immovable
as
a
jutting
promontory
against
which
the
waves
of
ocean
tossed
and
broke
in
dissolving
spray
there
he
stood
not
a
senator
loving
freedom
who
did
not
feel
on
that
day
that
a
champion
had
come
this
scene
so
brilliant
in
character
illustrates
long
career
in
the
senate
all
present
were
moved
while
those
at
a
distance
were
less
affected
his
speech
which
was
argumentative
direct
and
pungent
exerted
more
influence
on
those
who
heard
it
than
on
those
who
only
read
it
vindicating
his
place
as
debater
rather
than
orator
this
place
he
held
to
the
end
without
a
superior
without
a
peer
nobody
could
match
him
in
immediate
and
incisive
reply
his
words
were
swift
and
sharp
as
a
cimeter
or
borrowing
an
illustration
from
an
opposite
quarter
he
and
with
unerring
aim
but
while
this
great
talent
secured
for
him
always
the
first
honors
of
debate
it
was
less
important
with
the
country
which
except
in
rare
instances
is
more
impressed
by
ideas
and
by
those
forms
in
which
truth
is
manifest
the
senate
has
changed
much
from
its
original
character
when
shortly
after
the
formation
of
the
national
government
a
nova
scotia
paper
in
a
passage
copied
by
one
of
our
own
journals
while
declaring
that
habits
of
the
people
here
are
very
favorable
to
oratory
could
say
is
but
one
assembly
in
the
whole
range
of
the
federal
union
in
which
eloquence
is
deemed
unnecessary
and
i
believe
even
absurd
and
obtrusive
to
wit
the
senate
or
upper
house
of
congress
they
are
merely
a
deliberative
meeting
in
which
every
man
delivers
his
concise
opinion
one
leg
over
the
other
as
they
did
in
the
first
congress
where
an
harangue
was
a
great
speech
was
then
for
business
and
immediate
effect
in
the
chamber
since
then
the
transformation
has
proceeded
speech
becoming
constantly
more
important
until
now
without
neglect
of
business
the
senate
has
become
a
centre
from
which
to
address
the
country
a
seat
here
is
a
lofty
pulpit
with
a
mighty
and
the
whole
people
is
the
congregation
as
fessenden
rarely
spoke
except
for
business
what
he
said
was
restricted
in
its
influence
but
it
was
most
effective
in
this
chamber
here
was
his
empire
and
his
undisputed
throne
of
perfect
integrity
and
austerest
virtue
he
was
inaccessible
to
those
temptations
which
in
various
forms
beset
the
avenues
of
public
life
most
faithfully
and
constantly
did
he
watch
the
interests
intrusted
to
him
here
he
was
a
model
holding
the
position
of
chairman
of
the
finance
committee
while
it
yet
had
those
double
duties
which
are
now
divided
between
two
important
committees
he
became
the
guardian
of
the
national
treasury
both
in
its
receipts
and
its
expenditures
so
that
nothing
was
added
to
it
or
taken
from
it
without
his
knowledge
and
how
truly
he
discharged
this
immense
trust
all
will
attest
nothing
could
leave
the
treasury
without
showing
a
passport
this
service
was
the
more
momentous
from
the
magnitude
of
the
transactions
involved
for
it
was
during
the
whole
period
of
the
war
when
appropriations
responded
to
loans
and
taxes
all
being
on
a
scale
beyond
precedent
in
the
history
on
these
questions
sometimes
so
sensitive
and
difficult
and
always
so
grave
his
influence
was
beyond
that
of
any
other
senator
and
constantly
swayed
the
senate
all
that
our
best
generals
were
in
arms
he
was
in
the
financial
field
absorbed
in
his
great
duties
and
confined
too
much
by
the
training
of
a
profession
which
too
often
makes
its
follower
slave
where
he
is
not
master
he
forgot
sometimes
that
championship
which
shone
so
brightly
when
he
first
entered
the
senate
came
with
its
disturbing
influence
and
without
any
of
the
nature
of
hamlet
his
conduct
at
times
suggested
those
words
by
which
hamlet
pictures
the
of
life
too
often
in
his
case
native
hue
of
resolution
was
sicklied
with
the
pale
cast
of
and
perhaps
i
might
follow
the
words
of
shakespeare
further
and
picture
of
great
pith
and
moment
which
this
regard
their
currents
turned
awry
and
lost
the
name
of
men
are
tempted
by
the
talent
which
they
possess
and
he
could
not
resist
the
impulse
to
employ
sometimes
out
of
place
those
extraordinary
powers
which
he
commanded
so
easily
more
penetrating
than
grasping
he
easily
pierced
the
argument
of
his
opponent
and
once
engaged
he
yielded
to
the
excitement
of
the
moment
and
the
joy
of
conflict
his
words
warmed
as
the
olympic
wheel
caught
fire
in
the
swiftness
of
the
race
if
on
these
occasions
there
were
sparkles
which
fell
where
they
should
not
have
fallen
they
can
not
be
remembered
now
were
he
still
among
us
face
to
face
it
were
better
to
say
in
the
words
of
that
earliest
recorded
reconciliation
us
no
more
contend
nor
blame
each
other
blamed
enough
elsewhere
but
strive
in
offices
of
love
how
we
may
lighten
each
burden
in
our
share
of
error
and
frailty
checker
the
life
of
man
if
this
were
not
so
earth
would
be
heaven
for
what
could
add
to
the
happiness
of
life
free
from
error
and
frailty
the
senator
we
mourn
was
human
but
the
error
and
frailty
which
belonged
to
him
often
took
their
color
from
virtue
itself
on
these
he
needs
no
silence
even
if
the
grave
which
is
now
closing
over
him
did
not
refuse
its
echoes
except
to
what
is
good
cuban
belligerency
remarks
in
the
senate
december
carpenter
of
wisconsin
having
moved
to
proceed
to
the
consideration
of
a
resolution
previously
introduced
by
him
setting
forth
in
the
opinion
of
the
senate
the
thirty
purchased
or
contracted
for
in
the
united
states
by
or
on
behalf
of
the
government
of
spain
to
be
employed
against
the
revolted
district
of
cuba
should
not
be
allowed
to
depart
from
the
united
states
during
the
continuance
of
that
rebellion
sumner
said
i
shall
interpose
no
objection
to
that
but
i
feel
it
my
duty
to
suggest
that
it
does
seem
to
me
that
a
discussion
of
that
question
is
premature
and
for
this
reason
there
is
no
information
with
regard
to
those
now
before
the
senate
except
what
we
derive
from
the
newspapers
i
understand
that
the
department
of
state
will
in
a
few
days
as
soon
as
the
documents
can
be
copied
communicate
to
the
senate
all
that
it
has
with
reference
to
our
relations
with
cuba
which
will
probably
cover
the
question
of
the
there
is
a
question
of
fact
and
of
law
and
i
for
one
am
indisposed
to
approach
its
discussion
until
i
have
all
the
information
now
in
the
possession
of
the
government
at
the
same
time
my
friend
from
wisconsin
will
understand
that
i
have
no
disposition
to
interfere
with
any
desires
he
may
have
if
he
wishes
therefore
to
go
on
i
shall
content
myself
with
the
suggestions
that
i
have
made
motion
prevailing
he
proceeded
with
an
argument
in
support
of
the
resolution
in
question
to
which
sumner
replied
as
follows
president
the
senator
from
wisconsin
closed
by
saying
that
he
understood
that
eighteen
of
the
would
leave
i
have
had
put
into
my
hands
a
telegram
received
last
night
from
new
york
which
i
will
read
as
it
relates
to
that
subject
vessels
delivered
by
delamater
to
the
representatives
of
the
spanish
navy
have
their
officers
and
crews
on
board
and
fly
the
flag
of
spain
they
are
now
as
completely
the
property
of
that
government
as
is
the
pizarro
unless
something
not
foreseen
occurs
they
will
be
at
sea
morning
if
not
already
is
this
morning
but
there
are
eight
other
boats
that
are
still
unfinished
on
the
stocks
to
which
the
resolution
of
the
senator
from
wisconsin
is
applicable
i
have
no
disposition
now
to
discuss
the
great
question
involved
in
the
speech
of
the
senator
from
wisconsin
but
the
senator
will
pardon
me
if
i
venture
to
suggest
that
he
has
misapprehended
the
meaning
of
the
statute
on
which
he
relies
certainly
he
has
misapprehended
it
or
i
have
he
has
misapprehended
it
or
the
administration
has
i
do
not
conceive
that
the
question
which
he
has
presented
can
arise
under
the
statute
the
language
on
which
he
relies
is
as
follows
any
person
shall
within
the
limits
of
the
united
states
fit
out
and
arm
or
attempt
to
fit
out
and
arm
or
procure
to
be
fitted
out
and
armed
or
shall
knowingly
be
concerned
in
the
furnishing
fitting
out
or
arming
of
any
ship
or
vessel
with
intent
that
such
ship
or
vessel
shall
be
employed
in
the
service
of
any
foreign
prince
or
state
or
of
any
colony
district
or
people
to
cruise
or
commit
hostilities
against
the
subjects
citizens
or
property
of
any
foreign
prince
or
state
or
of
any
colony
district
or
people
with
whom
the
united
states
are
at
peace
the
operative
words
on
which
the
senator
relies
being
colony
district
or
people
i
understand
the
senator
to
insist
that
under
these
words
spain
can
not
purchase
ships
in
the
united
states
to
cruise
against
her
cuban
subjects
now
in
revolt
that
is
the
position
of
the
senator
he
states
it
frankly
to
that
i
specifically
reply
that
the
language
of
the
statute
is
entirely
inapplicable
those
words
if
the
senator
will
consult
their
history
were
introduced
for
a
specific
purpose
it
was
to
meet
the
case
of
the
revolted
spanish
colonies
already
for
eight
years
in
arms
against
the
parent
government
having
ships
in
every
sea
largely
possessing
the
territories
on
the
spanish
main
and
with
independence
nearly
achieved
there
was
no
question
of
belligerence
it
was
admitted
by
all
the
civilized
world
nation
after
nation
practically
recognized
it
our
government
our
courts
every
department
of
the
government
recognized
the
belligerence
of
those
spanish
colonies
their
independence
was
recognized
more
tardily
after
ample
discussion
in
these
two
chambers
as
late
as
but
their
belligerence
was
a
fact
perfectly
established
and
recognized
by
every
branch
of
the
government
to
meet
their
case
and
for
no
other
object
as
i
understand
it
miller
a
representative
of
south
carolina
on
the
day
of
december
introduced
the
following
resolution
that
a
committee
be
appointed
to
inquire
into
the
expediency
of
so
amending
the
fourth
section
of
the
act
passed
on
the
of
march
entitled
act
more
effectually
to
preserve
the
neutral
relations
of
the
united
states
as
to
embrace
within
the
provisions
thereof
the
armed
vessels
of
a
government
at
peace
with
the
united
states
and
at
war
with
any
colony
district
or
people
with
whom
the
united
states
are
or
may
be
at
the
important
words
colony
district
or
were
introduced
to
cover
the
precise
case
of
the
revolted
spanish
colonies
and
their
precise
condition
at
that
moment
there
being
no
question
of
belligerence
now
the
practical
question
is
whether
these
words
introduced
originally
for
a
specific
purpose
having
an
historic
character
beyond
question
can
be
extended
so
as
to
be
applied
to
insurgents
who
have
not
yet
achieved
a
corporate
existence
who
have
no
provinces
no
cities
no
towns
no
ports
no
prize
courts
such
is
the
fact
i
can
not
supply
the
fact
if
it
does
not
exist
nor
can
the
senator
with
his
eloquence
and
with
his
ardor
enlisted
in
this
cause
we
must
seek
the
truth
the
truth
is
found
in
the
actual
facts
now
do
those
facts
justify
the
concession
which
the
senator
requires
the
cuban
insurgents
whatever
the
inspiration
of
their
action
have
not
reached
the
condition
of
belligerents
such
i
repeat
is
the
fact
and
we
can
not
alter
the
fact
here
we
must
rely
upon
the
evidence
which
according
to
all
the
information
within
my
reach
is
adverse
they
do
not
come
within
any
of
the
prerequisites
they
have
no
provinces
no
towns
no
ports
no
prize
courts
without
these
i
am
at
a
loss
to
see
how
they
can
be
treated
as
belligerents
by
foreign
powers
before
this
great
concession
there
must
be
assurance
of
their
capacity
to
administer
justice
above
all
there
must
be
a
prize
court
but
nobody
pretends
that
there
is
any
such
thing
carpenter
will
the
senator
now
allow
me
to
ask
him
one
question
sumner
certainly
carpenter
my
question
is
if
it
be
not
the
most
favorable
opportunity
to
obtain
the
facts
to
libel
those
boats
and
get
proof
on
the
question
sumner
the
senator
will
pardon
me
if
i
say
i
do
not
think
it
is
i
think
that
the
better
way
of
ascertaining
the
facts
is
to
send
to
our
authorized
agents
in
cuba
we
have
consuls
at
every
considerable
place
and
direct
them
to
report
on
the
facts
i
understand
such
reports
have
been
received
by
the
department
of
state
they
will
be
communicated
to
the
senate
they
are
expected
day
by
day
and
they
are
explicit
unless
i
have
been
misinformed
on
this
single
point
that
whatever
may
be
the
inspiration
of
that
insurrection
it
has
not
yet
reached
that
condition
of
maturity
that
corporate
character
which
in
point
of
fact
makes
it
belligerent
in
character
howard
i
do
not
wish
to
interrupt
the
senator
but
i
should
like
to
ask
a
question
at
this
point
sumner
certainly
howard
i
wish
for
information
on
this
subject
and
i
think
we
all
stand
in
need
of
it
and
i
should
be
very
much
obliged
to
the
senator
from
massachusetts
if
he
is
able
to
do
so
if
he
would
give
us
a
statement
of
the
amount
of
military
force
actually
in
the
field
in
cuba
or
the
amount
of
force
that
is
available
and
whether
the
insurgents
have
established
a
civil
government
for
themselves
whether
it
be
or
be
not
in
operation
as
a
government
on
these
subjects
i
confess
my
ignorance
sumner
the
senator
confesses
we
are
in
the
dark
and
on
this
account
i
consider
the
debate
premature
we
all
need
information
and
i
understand
it
will
be
supplied
by
the
department
of
state
there
is
information
on
the
precise
point
to
which
the
senator
calls
attention
and
that
is
as
to
the
number
of
the
forces
on
both
sides
i
understand
on
the
side
of
the
insurgents
it
has
latterly
very
much
diminished
and
i
have
been
told
that
they
are
now
little
more
than
and
that
the
war
they
are
carrying
on
is
little
more
than
a
guerrilla
contest
that
they
are
not
in
possession
of
any
town
or
considerable
place
such
is
my
information
howard
have
they
any
government
sumner
i
understand
they
have
the
government
that
is
in
a
camp
with
regard
to
that
the
senator
knows
as
well
as
i
but
that
brings
us
back
again
to
the
necessity
of
information
howard
any
civil
government
any
legislative
power
for
the
actual
exercise
of
legislative
functions
sumner
i
think
there
is
no
evidence
that
there
is
a
legislative
body
and
i
must
say
i
await
with
great
anxiety
the
evidence
of
their
action
on
the
subject
of
slavery
itself
what
assurance
have
we
that
slavery
will
be
terminated
by
these
insurgents
have
they
the
will
have
they
the
power
i
know
the
report
that
they
have
abolished
slavery
but
this
report
leaves
much
to
be
desired
i
wish
it
to
be
authenticated
and
relieved
from
all
doubt
it
is
said
that
there
are
two
decrees
one
to
be
read
at
home
and
another
to
be
read
abroad
is
this
true
and
even
if
not
true
is
there
any
assurance
that
the
insurrectionists
are
able
to
make
this
decree
good
but
while
i
require
the
surrender
of
slavery
from
the
insurrectionists
i
make
the
same
requirement
of
spain
why
has
this
power
delayed
morton
i
ask
the
senator
if
spain
has
not
recently
affirmed
the
existence
of
slavery
in
cuba
and
porto
rico
especially
in
porto
rico
by
publishing
a
new
constitution
guarantying
the
existence
of
slavery
sumner
i
am
not
able
to
inform
the
senator
precisely
on
that
point
i
do
know
enough
however
to
satisfy
me
that
spain
is
a
laggard
on
this
question
and
if
my
voice
could
reach
her
now
it
would
plead
with
her
to
be
quick
to
make
haste
to
abolish
slavery
not
only
in
cuba
but
in
porto
rico
its
continued
existence
is
a
shame
and
it
should
cease
i
have
no
disposition
to
go
into
this
subject
at
length
there
is
however
one
other
remark
that
the
senator
from
wisconsin
made
to
which
i
shall
be
justified
in
replying
he
alludes
to
the
case
of
the
hornet
and
the
proceedings
against
that
vessel
it
is
not
for
me
now
to
vindicate
those
proceedings
they
may
have
been
proper
under
the
statute
or
may
not
but
it
is
very
clear
to
me
that
the
cases
of
the
hornet
and
the
spanish
are
plainly
distinguishable
and
if
the
senate
will
pardon
me
one
moment
i
will
make
the
distinction
i
think
perfectly
apparent
we
all
know
that
two
or
three
or
four
or
a
dozen
persons
may
levy
war
against
the
government
may
levy
war
against
the
king
a
traitor
levies
war
against
the
king
the
king
when
he
proceeds
against
the
traitor
does
not
levy
war
he
simply
proceeds
in
the
exercise
of
his
executive
functions
in
order
to
establish
his
authority
and
in
the
spirit
of
this
illustration
i
am
disposed
to
believe
that
the
united
states
were
perfectly
justifiable
even
under
this
statute
in
arresting
the
hornet
but
they
would
not
be
justifiable
in
arresting
the
spanish
the
hornet
was
levying
war
against
spain
and
therefore
subject
to
arrest
the
are
levying
no
war
simply
because
the
insurrection
against
which
they
are
to
be
used
has
not
reached
the
condition
of
war
carpenter
will
the
senator
allow
me
to
ask
one
other
question
sumner
certainly
carpenter
what
i
want
to
know
is
this
whether
the
condition
of
neutrality
does
not
necessarily
depend
upon
the
fact
that
war
is
progressing
between
two
parties
can
there
be
any
neutrality
unless
there
is
a
contest
of
arms
going
on
between
two
somebodies
now
if
it
be
a
violation
of
our
neutrality
act
for
one
of
those
bodies
to
come
in
and
fit
out
vessels
in
the
united
states
is
it
not
equally
so
for
the
other
or
is
our
pretence
of
neutrality
a
falsehood
a
cheat
and
a
delusion
sumner
president
i
do
not
regard
it
as
a
question
of
neutrality
until
the
belligerence
of
these
people
is
recognized
they
are
not
of
themselves
a
power
they
are
not
a
people
therefore
there
can
be
no
neutrality
on
the
part
of
our
government
between
spain
and
her
revolted
subjects
until
they
come
up
to
the
condition
of
a
people
they
have
not
reached
that
point
and
therefore
i
submit
that
there
is
at
this
moment
no
question
of
neutrality
and
that
the
argument
of
the
senator
in
that
respect
was
inapplicable
when
the
belligerence
of
the
insurgents
is
recognized
there
will
be
a
case
for
neutrality
and
not
before
admission
of
virginia
to
representation
in
congress
speeches
in
the
senate
january
january
the
senate
proceeded
to
the
consideration
of
a
joint
resolution
reported
from
the
committee
on
the
judiciary
declaring
the
state
of
virginia
is
entitled
to
representation
in
the
congress
of
the
united
states
she
having
as
was
said
in
all
respects
with
the
reconstruction
sumner
apprehending
that
this
compliance
had
been
merely
formal
and
that
the
rebel
spirit
was
still
the
dominant
influence
in
virginia
urged
postponement
of
the
measure
for
a
few
days
to
afford
opportunity
for
information
remarking
i
am
assured
that
there
are
resolutions
of
public
meetings
in
different
parts
of
virginia
that
there
are
papers
letters
communications
all
tending
to
throw
light
on
the
actual
condition
of
things
in
that
state
which
in
the
course
of
a
short
time
of
a
few
days
at
furthest
will
be
presented
to
the
senate
under
these
circumstances
i
submit
most
respectfully
and
without
preferring
any
request
with
reference
to
myself
that
the
measure
should
be
allowed
to
go
over
for
a
few
days
perhaps
for
a
week
till
monday
next
and
that
it
then
should
be
taken
up
and
proceeded
with
to
the
end
my
object
is
that
when
the
senate
acts
on
this
important
measure
it
may
act
wisely
with
adequate
knowledge
and
so
that
hereafter
it
may
have
no
occasion
to
regret
its
conclusion
how
many
are
there
now
sir
who
on
the
information
in
our
papers
would
not
recall
the
vote
by
which
tennessee
was
declared
entitled
to
her
place
as
a
state
you
sir
have
read
that
report
signed
by
the
representatives
of
tennessee
and
by
her
honored
senator
here
on
my
right
brownlow
from
that
you
will
see
the
condition
of
things
in
that
state
at
this
moment
is
there
not
a
lesson
sir
in
that
condition
of
things
does
it
not
teach
us
to
be
cautious
before
we
commit
this
great
state
of
virginia
back
to
the
hands
of
the
people
that
have
swayed
it
in
war
against
the
national
government
sir
this
is
a
great
responsibility
i
am
anxious
that
the
senate
should
exercise
it
only
after
adequate
knowledge
and
inquiry
i
do
not
believe
that
they
have
the
means
at
this
moment
of
coming
to
a
proper
determination
after
extended
debate
proposition
finally
took
shape
in
a
motion
by
his
colleague
wilson
to
postpone
the
further
consideration
of
the
resolution
for
three
days
in
response
to
stewart
of
nevada
who
had
charge
of
the
measure
and
who
insisted
that
one
had
been
able
to
find
a
reason
worthy
of
consideration
why
they
should
not
proceed
and
act
affirmatively
at
once
sumner
said
president
it
seems
to
me
that
this
discussion
tends
irresistibly
to
one
conclusion
that
the
senate
is
not
now
prepared
to
act
i
do
not
say
that
it
will
not
be
prepared
in
one
two
or
three
days
or
in
a
week
but
it
is
not
now
prepared
to
act
not
a
senator
has
spoken
either
on
one
side
or
the
other
who
has
not
made
points
of
law
some
of
them
presented
for
the
first
time
in
this
chamber
hardly
a
senator
has
spoken
who
has
not
presented
questions
of
fact
how
are
we
to
determine
these
time
is
essential
we
must
be
able
to
look
into
the
papers
to
examine
the
evidence
and
if
my
friend
will
pardon
me
to
examine
also
the
law
to
see
whether
the
conclusion
on
which
he
stands
so
firmly
is
one
on
which
the
senate
can
plant
itself
forevermore
the
senator
must
bear
in
mind
that
what
we
do
now
with
reference
to
virginia
we
do
permanently
and
irrepealably
and
that
we
affect
the
interests
of
that
great
state
and
i
submit
also
the
safety
of
a
large
portion
of
its
population
sir
i
am
not
willing
to
go
forward
in
haste
and
in
ignorance
to
deal
with
so
great
a
question
let
us
consider
it
let
us
approach
it
carefully
and
give
to
it
something
of
that
attention
which
the
grandeur
of
the
interest
involved
requires
i
think
therefore
the
suggestion
of
my
colleague
that
this
matter
be
postponed
for
several
days
is
proper
it
is
only
according
to
the
ordinary
course
of
business
of
the
senate
and
it
is
sustained
by
manifest
reason
in
this
particular
case
i
should
prefer
that
the
postponement
were
till
next
monday
and
i
will
be
precise
in
assigning
my
reason
it
is
nothing
personal
to
myself
my
friend
from
new
york
said
or
intimated
that
if
the
senator
from
massachusetts
wished
to
be
accommodated
he
would
be
ready
of
course
to
consent
to
gratify
him
now
i
would
not
have
it
placed
on
that
ground
i
present
it
as
a
question
of
business
and
i
as
a
senator
interested
in
the
decision
of
this
business
wish
to
have
time
to
peruse
these
papers
and
to
obtain
that
knowledge
which
will
enable
me
to
decide
ultimately
on
the
case
i
have
not
now
the
knowledge
that
i
desire
with
reference
to
the
actual
condition
of
things
in
virginia
i
am
assured
by
those
in
whom
i
place
confidence
that
in
the
course
of
a
few
days
that
evidence
will
be
forthcoming
will
not
the
senate
receive
it
will
it
press
hastily
heedlessly
recklessly
to
a
conclusion
which
when
reached
it
may
hereafter
find
occasion
to
regret
let
us
sir
so
act
that
we
shall
have
hereafter
no
regrets
let
us
so
act
that
the
people
of
virginia
hereafter
may
be
safe
and
that
they
may
express
their
gratitude
to
the
congress
of
the
united
states
which
has
helped
to
protect
them
the
senator
from
nevada
said
that
if
we
oppose
the
present
bill
we
sacrifice
the
legislature
of
the
state
i
suggest
to
that
senator
that
if
we
do
not
oppose
this
bill
we
sacrifice
the
people
of
the
state
what
sir
is
a
legislature
chosen
as
this
recent
legislature
has
been
chosen
in
virginia
composed
of
recent
rebels
still
filled
and
seething
with
that
old
rebel
fire
what
is
that
legislature
in
the
scale
compared
with
the
safety
of
that
great
people
sir
i
put
in
one
scale
the
welfare
of
the
state
of
virginia
the
future
security
of
its
large
population
historic
and
memorable
in
our
annals
and
in
the
other
scale
i
put
a
legislature
composed
of
recent
rebels
to
save
that
legislature
the
senator
from
nevada
presses
forward
to
sacrifice
the
people
of
the
state
the
motion
to
postpone
was
rejected
yeas
nays
and
the
debate
on
the
joint
resolution
proceeded
the
first
question
being
on
an
amendment
offered
by
drake
of
missouri
providing
that
the
passage
by
the
legislature
of
virginia
at
any
time
thereafter
of
any
act
or
resolution
rescinding
or
annulling
its
ratification
of
the
fifteenth
article
of
amendment
to
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
should
operate
to
exclude
the
state
from
representation
in
congress
and
remand
it
to
its
former
provisional
government
january
sumner
following
morton
of
indiana
in
support
of
proposed
amendment
and
with
him
maintaining
the
continued
power
of
congress
over
a
state
after
reconstruction
said
president
i
have
but
one
word
to
say
and
it
is
one
of
gratitude
to
the
senator
from
indiana
for
the
complete
adhesion
he
now
makes
to
a
principle
of
constitutional
law
which
i
have
no
doubt
is
unassailable
the
congress
of
the
united
states
will
have
forevermore
the
power
to
protect
reconstruction
no
one
of
these
states
by
anything
that
it
may
do
hereafter
can
escape
from
that
power
i
call
it
it
will
reach
just
as
far
as
the
endeavor
to
counteract
it
it
is
coextensive
with
the
constitution
itself
i
have
no
doubt
of
it
and
i
am
delighted
that
the
distinguished
senator
from
indiana
has
given
to
it
the
support
of
his
authority
while
i
feel
so
grateful
to
my
friend
from
indiana
for
what
he
has
said
on
this
point
he
will
allow
me
to
express
my
dissent
from
another
proposition
of
his
he
says
that
we
are
now
bound
under
our
reconstruction
acts
to
admit
virginia
i
deny
it
morton
will
the
senator
allow
me
one
moment
sumner
certainly
morton
i
do
not
pretend
that
there
is
any
clause
in
the
reconstruction
acts
which
in
express
words
requires
us
to
admit
virginia
upon
the
compliance
with
certain
conditions
but
what
i
mean
to
say
is
that
there
went
forth
with
those
laws
an
understanding
to
the
country
as
clear
and
distinct
as
if
it
had
been
written
in
the
statute
that
upon
a
full
and
honorable
compliance
with
them
those
states
should
be
admitted
i
will
ask
my
friend
from
massachusetts
if
that
understanding
did
not
exist
sumner
my
answer
to
the
senator
is
found
in
the
last
section
of
the
act
authorizing
the
submission
of
the
constitutions
of
these
states
as
follows
the
proceedings
in
any
of
said
states
shall
not
be
deemed
final
or
operate
as
a
complete
restoration
thereof
until
their
action
respectively
shall
be
approved
by
what
is
the
meaning
of
that
the
whole
case
is
brought
before
congress
for
consideration
we
are
to
look
into
it
and
consider
the
circumstances
under
which
these
elections
have
taken
place
and
see
whether
we
can
justly
give
to
them
our
approval
is
that
vain
language
was
it
not
introduced
for
a
purpose
was
it
merely
for
show
was
it
for
deception
was
it
a
cheat
no
sir
it
was
there
with
a
view
to
a
practical
result
to
meet
precisely
the
case
now
before
the
senate
that
is
a
seeming
compliance
with
the
requirements
of
our
reconstruction
policy
but
a
failure
in
substance
now
i
will
read
what
was
in
the
bill
of
march
entitled
act
to
provide
for
the
more
efficient
government
of
the
rebel
it
declares
in
the
preamble
that
is
necessary
that
peace
and
good
order
should
be
enforced
in
said
states
strong
language
that
loyal
and
republican
state
governments
can
be
legally
that
is
what
congress
is
to
require
to
that
end
congress
must
look
into
the
circumstances
of
the
case
it
must
consider
what
the
condition
of
the
people
there
is
whether
this
new
government
is
loyal
whether
it
is
in
the
hands
of
loyal
people
to
that
duty
congress
is
summoned
by
its
very
legislation
the
duty
is
laid
down
in
advance
and
so
you
may
go
through
all
these
reconstruction
statutes
and
you
will
find
that
under
all
of
them
the
whole
subject
is
brought
back
ultimately
to
the
discretion
of
congress
this
whole
subject
now
is
in
the
discretion
of
congress
i
trust
that
congress
will
exercise
it
so
that
life
and
liberty
and
property
shall
be
safe
january
sumner
presented
a
memorial
from
citizens
of
virginia
then
in
washington
claiming
to
represent
the
loyal
people
of
that
state
in
which
they
declare
themselves
for
the
prompt
admission
of
the
state
to
representation
upon
such
terms
that
a
loyal
civil
government
may
be
maintained
and
the
rights
of
loyal
men
secured
which
they
say
feel
assured
can
not
be
the
case
if
any
condition
less
than
the
application
of
the
test
oath
to
the
legislature
shall
be
imposed
by
the
as
the
grounds
of
this
conviction
they
point
among
other
matters
to
the
continued
manifestations
of
the
rebel
spirit
in
the
community
the
ascendency
of
the
rebel
party
in
the
recently
elected
legislature
gained
as
they
insist
intimidation
fraud
violence
and
prevention
of
free
speech
and
particularly
to
the
evidences
of
disloyalty
and
of
meditated
bad
faith
in
regard
to
the
new
state
constitution
exhibited
in
speeches
and
other
utterances
of
the
governor
and
members
of
assembly
utterances
on
the
part
of
some
of
the
latter
accompanied
with
gross
contumely
of
a
distinguished
member
of
congress
from
massachusetts
all
of
which
the
memorialists
say
a
hearing
can
now
be
had
and
which
we
respectfully
request
may
be
granted
we
pledge
ourselves
to
show
by
sworn
witnesses
of
irreproachable
character
residing
in
the
memorial
was
received
with
denunciation
as
and
abusive
the
wailing
of
those
who
were
defeated
with
the
view
of
keeping
out
virginia
with
our
own
plighted
faith
and
honor
and
its
presentation
criticized
with
corresponding
severity
the
senators
from
nevada
leading
the
assault
sumner
responded
president
has
it
come
to
this
that
the
loyal
people
of
virginia
can
not
be
heard
on
this
floor
that
a
petition
presented
by
a
member
of
this
body
proceeding
from
them
is
to
have
first
the
denunciation
of
the
senator
from
nevada
on
my
right
nye
and
then
the
denunciation
of
the
senator
from
nevada
on
my
left
stewart
why
are
the
loyal
people
of
virginia
to
be
thus
exposed
what
have
they
done
sir
in
what
respect
is
that
petition
open
to
exception
the
senator
says
it
is
disrespectful
to
whom
to
this
body
to
the
other
chamber
to
the
president
of
the
united
states
to
any
branch
of
this
government
not
in
the
least
it
is
disrespectful
according
to
the
senator
from
nevada
to
the
present
governor
of
virginia
and
he
undertakes
to
state
his
case
now
sir
i
have
nothing
to
say
of
the
present
governor
of
virginia
i
am
told
that
he
is
on
this
floor
but
i
have
not
the
honor
of
his
acquaintance
and
i
know
very
little
about
him
i
make
no
allegation
no
suggestion
with
regard
to
his
former
course
he
may
have
been
as
sound
always
as
the
senator
from
nevada
himself
but
the
petitioners
from
virginia
say
the
contrary
they
are
so
circumstanced
as
to
know
more
about
him
than
the
senator
from
nevada
or
than
myself
and
they
are
so
circumstanced
as
to
have
a
great
stake
in
his
future
conduct
thus
circumstanced
they
send
their
respectful
petition
to
this
chamber
asking
a
hearing
and
what
is
the
answer
denunciation
from
one
senator
of
nevada
echoed
by
denunciation
from
the
other
senator
of
nevada
the
voice
of
nevada
on
this
occasion
is
united
it
is
one
to
denounce
a
loyal
petition
from
virginia
was
i
not
right
in
presenting
the
petition
shall
these
people
be
unheard
the
committee
which
the
senator
represents
led
by
the
senator
from
illinois
trumbull
and
now
led
by
himself
are
pressing
this
measure
to
a
precipitate
conclusion
these
petitioners
having
this
great
interest
in
the
result
ask
for
a
hearing
several
days
ago
i
presumed
respectfully
deferentially
to
ask
that
this
measure
should
be
postponed
a
few
days
in
order
to
give
an
opportunity
for
such
a
hearing
i
was
refused
the
senator
from
nevada
would
not
consent
and
with
the
assistance
of
democrats
he
crowds
this
measure
forward
sir
it
is
natural
allow
me
to
say
that
one
acting
in
this
new
conjunction
should
trifle
with
the
right
of
petition
when
one
begins
to
act
with
such
allies
i
can
well
imagine
that
he
loses
something
of
his
original
devotion
to
the
great
fundamental
principles
of
our
government
something
was
said
by
my
friend
the
other
senator
from
nevada
nye
on
another
passage
of
the
petition
referring
to
a
distinguished
colleague
of
my
own
why
sir
that
very
passage
furnishes
testimony
against
the
cause
represented
by
the
senator
from
nevada
it
shows
how
little
to
be
trusted
are
these
men
it
shows
the
game
of
treachery
which
they
have
undertaken
it
shows
how
they
are
intending
to
press
this
measure
through
congress
so
as
to
obtain
for
virginia
the
independence
of
a
state
are
you
ready
for
that
conclusion
are
you
ready
to
part
with
this
great
control
which
yet
remains
to
congress
through
which
security
may
be
maintained
for
the
rights
of
all
something
has
been
said
by
different
senators
of
plighted
faith
sir
there
is
a
faith
that
is
plighted
and
by
that
i
will
stand
god
willing
to
the
end
it
is
nothing
less
than
this
to
secure
the
rights
of
all
without
distinction
of
color
in
the
state
of
virginia
when
i
can
secure
those
rights
when
i
can
see
that
they
are
firmly
established
beyond
the
reach
of
fraud
beyond
the
violence
of
opposition
then
i
am
willing
that
that
state
shall
again
assume
its
independent
position
but
until
then
i
say
wait
in
the
name
of
justice
in
the
name
of
liberty
for
the
sake
of
human
rights
i
entreat
the
senate
to
wait
january
in
response
to
criticisms
by
trumbull
of
illinois
sumner
said
it
was
in
pursuance
of
the
effort
i
made
on
the
first
day
of
this
week
that
yesterday
i
presented
a
memorial
from
loyal
citizens
of
virginia
here
in
washington
i
presented
it
as
a
memorial
and
asked
to
have
it
read
the
senator
from
nevada
stewart
in
the
remarks
which
he
so
kindly
made
with
regard
to
me
later
in
the
day
said
that
in
asking
to
have
it
read
i
adopted
it
i
can
pardon
that
remark
to
the
senator
from
nevada
who
is
less
experienced
in
this
chamber
than
the
senator
from
illinois
but
the
latter
senator
has
repeated
substantially
the
same
remark
sir
this
is
a
new
position
that
in
presenting
a
memorial
one
adopts
it
especially
when
he
asks
to
have
it
read
why
sir
what
is
the
right
of
petition
is
it
reduced
to
this
that
no
petition
can
be
presented
unless
the
senator
approves
it
or
that
no
petition
can
be
read
at
the
request
of
a
senator
unless
he
approves
it
such
a
limitation
on
the
right
of
petition
would
go
far
to
cut
it
down
to
its
unhappy
condition
in
those
days
which
some
of
us
remember
sir
i
was
right
in
presenting
the
memorial
and
right
in
asking
to
have
it
read
and
now
what
is
its
character
it
sets
forth
a
condition
of
things
in
virginia
which
might
well
make
the
senate
pause
i
think
no
candid
person
can
have
listened
to
that
memorial
without
seeing
that
it
contains
statements
with
regard
to
which
the
senate
ought
to
be
instructed
before
it
proceeds
to
a
vote
do
you
consider
sir
that
when
you
install
this
legislature
you
consign
the
people
of
virginia
to
its
power
do
you
consider
that
to
this
body
belongs
the
choice
of
judges
the
whole
judiciary
of
the
state
is
to
be
organized
by
it
this
may
be
done
in
the
interests
of
freedom
and
humanity
or
in
the
ancient
interests
of
the
rebellion
i
am
anxious
that
this
judiciary
should
be
pure
and
devoted
to
human
rights
but
if
the
policy
is
pursued
which
finds
such
strenuous
support
especially
from
the
senator
from
illinois
farewell
then
to
such
a
judiciary
that
judiciary
which
is
often
called
the
palladium
of
the
commonwealth
through
which
justice
is
secured
rights
protected
and
all
men
are
made
safe
instead
of
that
you
will
have
a
judiciary
true
only
to
those
who
have
lately
been
in
rebellion
you
will
have
a
judiciary
that
will
set
its
face
like
flint
against
those
loyalists
that
find
so
little
favor
with
the
senator
from
illinois
you
will
have
a
judiciary
that
will
follow
out
the
spirit
which
the
senator
has
shown
and
do
little
else
than
pursue
vindictively
these
loyalists
there
has
been
allusion
to
the
governor
of
virginia
the
senator
says
i
have
made
an
assault
upon
him
oh
no
how
have
i
assaulted
him
i
said
simply
that
i
understood
he
was
on
the
floor
as
the
from
richmond
was
on
the
floor
that
is
all
that
i
said
but
now
there
is
something
with
regard
to
this
governor
to
which
i
should
like
to
have
an
answer
possibly
the
senator
may
be
able
to
answer
it
i
have
here
a
speech
purporting
to
have
been
made
by
him
at
an
agricultural
fair
in
the
southwest
part
of
virginia
after
the
election
from
which
with
your
permission
but
sir
without
adopting
it
at
all
or
making
myself
in
any
way
responsible
for
its
contents
i
will
read
walker
addressing
the
audience
says
little
talking
sometimes
does
a
great
deal
of
good
and
that
expended
in
the
late
canvass
i
heard
in
a
voice
of
thunder
on
the
of
july
when
the
people
of
your
noble
old
commonwealth
declared
themselves
against
vandalism
fraud
and
treachery
virginia
has
freed
herself
from
the
tyranny
of
a
horde
of
greedy
cormorants
and
unprincipled
who
came
to
sap
her
very
vitals
i
have
no
other
feeling
but
that
of
pity
for
the
opposition
party
who
were
deceived
and
led
by
adventurers
having
only
their
own
personal
aggrandizement
and
aims
in
view
with
neither
interest
character
nor
at
stake
for
this
a
majority
of
them
never
now
sir
what
are
the
operative
words
of
this
remarkable
speech
that
this
very
governor
walker
who
finds
a
vindicator
i
may
say
adopting
a
term
of
the
early
law
a
compurgator
in
the
senator
from
illinois
announces
that
by
this
recent
election
virginia
has
against
vandalism
fraud
and
treachery
has
freed
herself
from
the
tyranny
of
a
horde
of
greedy
cormorants
and
unprincipled
who
came
to
sap
her
very
such
is
the
language
by
which
this
governor
characterizes
loyal
people
from
the
north
from
the
west
from
all
parts
of
the
country
who
since
the
overthrow
of
the
rebellion
have
gone
there
with
their
household
gods
with
their
energies
with
their
character
with
their
means
to
contribute
to
the
resources
of
the
state
sir
what
does
all
this
suggest
to
my
mind
unhappy
days
in
the
future
to
my
mind
anything
but
justice
for
the
devoted
loyal
people
and
unionists
of
that
state
and
now
sir
while
i
make
this
plea
for
them
again
let
me
say
i
present
no
exclusive
claim
to
represent
them
i
speak
now
only
because
others
do
not
speak
and
as
in
other
days
when
i
encountered
the
opposition
of
the
senator
from
illinois
i
was
often
in
a
small
minority
sometimes
almost
alone
i
may
be
so
now
but
i
have
a
complete
conviction
that
the
course
i
am
now
taking
will
be
justified
by
the
future
sad
enough
if
it
be
so
i
hope
it
may
be
otherwise
amendment
was
rejected
another
thereupon
offered
by
edmunds
of
vermont
and
as
subsequently
amended
requiring
members
of
the
legislature
before
taking
or
resuming
their
seats
and
state
officers
before
entering
upon
office
to
make
oath
to
past
loyalty
or
removal
of
disabilities
was
adopted
other
provisions
against
exclusion
from
civil
rights
on
account
of
race
or
color
either
by
future
amendments
of
the
existing
state
constitution
or
by
rescinding
the
ratification
of
any
amendment
to
the
national
constitution
were
moved
as
of
admission
in
an
argument
january
maintaining
the
validity
of
such
conditions
the
pending
question
being
on
a
provision
of
this
character
offered
by
drake
sumner
spoke
as
follows
president
something
has
been
said
of
the
term
by
which
this
proposition
should
be
designated
one
will
not
call
it
finding
in
this
term
much
danger
but
at
the
same
time
he
refuses
to
the
unhappy
people
in
virginia
now
looking
to
us
for
protection
such
safeguard
as
may
be
found
in
this
proposition
for
myself
sir
i
make
no
question
of
terms
call
it
one
thing
or
another
it
is
the
same
for
it
has
in
it
protection
call
it
a
compact
i
accept
it
call
it
a
law
i
accept
it
call
it
a
condition
i
accept
it
it
is
all
three
condition
law
compact
and
as
all
three
binding
the
old
speak
of
a
triple
cord
here
you
have
it
my
friend
from
wisconsin
carpenter
falls
into
another
mistake
he
will
pardon
me
if
i
suggest
it
which
i
notice
with
regret
he
exalts
the
technical
state
above
the
real
state
he
knows
well
what
is
the
technical
state
which
is
found
in
form
in
technicality
in
privilege
if
you
please
for
he
has
made
himself
the
advocate
of
privilege
to
my
mind
the
state
is
the
people
and
its
highest
office
is
their
just
safeguard
and
when
it
is
declared
that
a
state
hereafter
shall
not
take
away
the
right
of
any
of
its
people
here
is
no
infringement
of
anything
that
belongs
to
a
state
i
entreat
my
friend
to
bear
the
distinction
in
mind
a
state
can
have
no
right
or
privilege
to
do
wrong
nor
can
the
denial
of
this
pretension
disparage
the
state
or
in
any
way
impair
its
complete
equality
with
other
states
the
states
have
no
power
except
to
do
justice
any
power
beyond
this
is
contrary
to
the
harmonies
of
the
universe
since
the
senator
spoke
i
sent
into
the
other
room
for
the
declaration
of
independence
in
order
to
read
a
sentence
which
is
beyond
question
the
touchstone
of
our
institutions
to
which
all
the
powers
of
a
state
must
be
brought
here
it
is
therefore
the
representatives
of
the
united
states
of
america
in
general
congress
assembled
appealing
to
the
supreme
judge
of
the
world
for
the
rectitude
of
our
intentions
do
in
the
name
and
by
the
authority
of
the
good
people
of
these
colonies
solemnly
publish
and
declare
that
these
united
colonies
are
and
of
right
ought
to
be
free
and
independent
and
then
it
proceeds
to
say
that
have
full
power
to
levy
war
conclude
peace
contract
alliances
establish
commerce
and
to
do
all
other
acts
and
things
which
independent
states
may
of
right
here
is
the
claim
with
its
limitation
the
great
claim
and
its
great
limitation
the
claim
was
independence
the
limitation
was
justice
independent
states
may
of
right
nothing
else
nothing
which
a
state
may
not
of
right
do
now
sir
bear
in
mind
do
not
forget
that
there
is
not
one
thing
prohibited
by
these
fundamental
conditions
that
a
state
may
of
right
do
therefore
sir
in
the
name
of
right
do
i
insist
that
it
is
binding
upon
the
state
it
is
binding
even
if
not
there
and
it
is
binding
being
there
its
insertion
is
like
notice
or
proclamation
of
the
perpetual
obligation
carpenter
will
the
senator
allow
me
to
ask
him
a
question
sumner
certainly
carpenter
in
speaking
of
a
state
of
this
union
does
not
the
senator
understand
the
term
to
apply
to
the
corporation
so
to
speak
the
government
of
the
state
sumner
i
do
not
carpenter
i
ask
the
senator
then
in
what
way
the
state
of
virginia
got
out
of
the
union
except
by
destroying
the
state
government
which
was
a
member
of
the
union
her
territory
was
always
in
her
people
were
always
subject
to
the
laws
of
the
united
states
sumner
there
i
agree
with
the
senator
her
people
were
always
in
her
territory
was
always
in
carpenter
but
her
government
was
not
sumner
not
out
her
government
was
destroyed
carpenter
yes
and
thereby
she
ceased
to
be
a
member
of
the
union
sumner
rather
than
say
that
she
had
ceased
to
be
a
member
of
the
union
i
would
say
that
her
government
was
destroyed
she
never
was
able
to
take
one
foot
of
her
soil
or
one
of
her
people
beyond
the
jurisdiction
of
the
nation
the
people
constitute
the
state
in
the
just
sense
and
it
has
been
always
our
duty
to
protect
them
and
this
i
now
propose
to
do
i
return
to
the
point
that
what
it
is
proposed
to
prohibit
by
these
fundamental
conditions
no
state
can
of
right
do
therefore
to
require
that
virginia
shall
not
do
these
things
is
no
infringement
of
anything
that
belongs
to
a
state
for
a
state
can
have
no
such
privilege
my
friend
made
himself
i
said
the
advocate
of
privilege
he
complained
that
if
we
imposed
these
conditions
we
should
impair
the
of
a
state
no
such
thing
the
state
can
have
no
such
thing
the
senator
would
not
curtail
a
state
of
its
fair
proportions
when
will
it
be
apparent
that
the
license
to
do
wrong
is
only
a
barbarism
then
again
the
senator
says
if
this
is
already
forbidden
why
repeat
the
prohibition
in
the
form
of
a
new
condition
why
sir
my
friend
is
too
well
read
in
the
history
of
liberty
and
of
its
struggles
to
make
that
inquiry
seriously
does
he
not
remember
how
in
english
history
liberty
has
been
won
by
just
such
repetitions
it
began
with
magna
charta
followed
shortly
afterward
by
a
repetition
then
again
in
the
time
of
charles
the
first
by
another
repetition
and
then
again
at
the
revolution
of
by
still
another
repetition
but
did
anybody
at
either
of
those
great
epochs
say
that
the
repetition
was
needless
because
all
contained
in
magna
charta
true
it
was
all
there
but
the
repetition
was
needed
in
order
to
press
it
home
upon
the
knowledge
and
the
conscience
of
the
people
carpenter
will
the
senator
allow
me
sumner
certainly
carpenter
is
not
the
great
distinction
in
this
fact
that
england
has
no
written
constitution
that
the
great
charter
is
a
mere
act
of
parliament
which
may
be
repealed
with
us
we
have
a
written
constitution
and
when
its
terms
and
provisions
are
once
clear
do
we
not
weaken
do
we
not
show
our
lack
of
faith
that
is
our
lack
of
confidence
in
the
value
of
the
provisions
by
reënacting
it
in
the
form
of
a
statute
sumner
i
must
say
i
can
not
follow
my
friend
to
that
conclusion
nor
do
i
see
the
difference
he
makes
between
magna
charta
in
england
and
our
constitution
i
believe
they
are
very
much
alike
and
i
believe
that
the
time
is
at
hand
when
another
document
of
our
history
will
stand
side
by
side
with
the
constitution
and
enjoy
with
it
coëqual
authority
as
it
has
more
than
the
renown
of
the
constitution
i
mean
the
declaration
of
independence
this
is
the
first
constitution
of
our
history
it
is
our
first
magna
charta
nor
can
any
state
depart
from
it
nor
can
this
nation
depart
from
it
to
all
the
promises
and
the
pledges
of
that
great
declaration
are
we
all
pledged
whether
as
nation
or
as
state
the
nation
when
it
bends
before
them
exalts
itself
and
when
it
requires
their
performance
of
a
state
again
exalts
itself
and
exalts
the
state
also
so
i
see
it
full
well
sir
i
know
that
in
other
days
when
slavery
prevailed
in
this
chamber
there
was
a
different
rule
of
interpretation
but
i
had
thought
that
our
war
had
changed
all
that
sir
to
my
mind
the
greatest
victory
in
that
terrible
conflict
was
not
at
appomattox
oh
no
by
no
means
nor
was
it
in
the
triumphal
march
of
sherman
oh
no
by
no
means
this
greatest
victory
was
the
establishment
of
a
new
rule
of
interpretation
by
which
the
institutions
of
our
country
are
dedicated
forevermore
to
human
rights
and
the
declaration
of
independence
is
made
a
living
letter
instead
of
a
promise
clearly
unquestionably
beyond
all
doubt
that
sir
was
the
greatest
victory
of
our
war
greater
than
any
found
on
any
field
of
blood
as
a
victory
of
ideas
is
above
any
victory
of
the
sword
as
the
establishment
of
human
rights
is
the
end
and
consummation
of
government
without
which
government
is
hard
to
bear
if
not
a
sham
january
the
joint
resolution
as
amended
was
laid
on
the
table
and
the
senate
took
up
the
house
bill
which
admitted
the
state
to
representation
clear
of
all
conditions
immediately
whereupon
edmunds
moved
the
proviso
concerning
the
oath
to
be
taken
by
members
of
the
legislature
and
state
officers
which
had
been
attached
to
the
former
measure
the
renewal
of
this
proviso
gave
rise
to
renewed
and
protracted
debate
in
the
course
of
which
sumner
in
speeches
on
the
and
in
reply
to
an
elaborate
defence
of
governor
walker
by
stewart
against
the
charges
of
disloyalty
and
meditated
bad
faith
adduced
copious
extracts
from
speeches
of
the
governor
and
others
together
with
numerous
letters
from
various
parts
of
the
state
all
serving
to
show
as
he
conceived
that
the
late
election
was
huge
colossal
meanwhile
colleague
wilson
with
a
view
to
bill
in
which
all
could
unite
moved
the
reference
of
the
pending
bill
to
the
committee
on
the
judiciary
the
purpose
of
having
the
whole
question
thoroughly
examined
a
motion
which
on
the
part
of
the
committee
itself
was
strenuously
opposed
upon
this
posture
of
the
case
january
morton
of
indiana
remarked
that
seemed
to
be
an
obstinate
determination
that
virginia
must
come
in
according
to
the
bill
reported
by
the
committee
or
not
come
in
at
all
that
senator
from
nevada
stewart
with
all
his
zeal
and
his
good
intentions
was
standing
as
substantially
in
the
way
of
the
admission
of
virginia
as
the
senator
from
massachusetts
sumner
and
turning
to
the
latter
he
said
seems
that
the
distinguished
senator
from
massachusetts
is
unwilling
that
virginia
shall
come
in
now
upon
any
terms
and
the
senator
has
developed
more
clearly
this
morning
than
he
has
done
before
what
his
desire
is
it
is
that
there
shall
be
a
new
election
in
virginia
am
i
right
in
regard
to
that
sumner
i
have
not
said
that
morton
then
what
does
the
argument
mean
that
the
last
election
was
a
monstrous
fraud
what
is
the
object
in
proving
that
the
last
election
was
a
monstrous
fraud
unless
the
senator
wants
a
new
election
let
us
have
an
understanding
about
that
sumner
i
wish
to
purge
the
legislature
of
its
rebels
i
understand
that
of
the
legislature
if
not
more
can
not
take
the
test
oath
that
is
what
i
first
propose
to
do
after
further
remarks
by
morton
sumner
spoke
as
follows
president
in
what
the
senator
from
indiana
has
said
in
reply
to
the
senator
from
nevada
i
entirely
sympathize
i
unite
with
the
senator
from
indiana
in
his
amendments
i
unite
with
him
in
his
aspirations
for
that
security
in
the
future
which
i
say
is
the
first
great
object
now
of
our
legislation
in
matters
of
reconstruction
without
security
in
the
future
reconstruction
is
a
failure
and
that
now
should
be
our
first
prime
object
but
while
i
unite
with
the
senator
on
those
points
he
will
pardon
me
if
i
suggest
to
him
that
he
has
not
done
me
justice
in
his
reference
to
what
i
said
and
now
sir
before
i
comment
on
his
remarks
i
ask
to
have
the
pending
motion
read
the
presiding
officer
anthony
of
rhode
island
in
the
chair
the
pending
motion
is
the
motion
of
the
senator
from
massachusetts
wilson
to
refer
the
bill
to
the
committee
on
the
judiciary
sumner
so
i
understood
sir
and
it
was
to
that
motion
that
i
spoke
i
argued
that
the
bill
and
all
pending
questions
should
be
referred
to
the
committee
and
on
what
ground
that
the
election
was
carried
by
a
colossal
fraud
the
senator
complains
because
i
did
not
go
further
and
say
whether
i
would
have
a
new
election
or
not
the
occasion
did
not
require
it
i
am
not
in
the
habit
the
senator
knows
well
of
hesitating
in
the
expression
of
my
opinions
but
logically
the
time
had
not
come
for
the
expression
of
any
opinion
on
that
point
my
argument
was
that
there
must
be
inquiry
to
that
point
the
senate
knows
well
i
have
directed
attention
from
the
beginning
of
this
debate
i
have
said
speed
this
matter
why
hurry
it
to
this
rash
consummation
why
without
inquiry
hand
over
the
loyalists
of
virginia
bound
hand
and
foot
as
victims
that
is
what
i
have
said
and
it
is
no
answer
for
my
friend
to
say
that
i
do
not
declare
whether
i
would
have
a
new
election
or
not
when
an
inquiry
has
been
made
and
we
know
officially
and
in
authentic
form
the
precise
facts
i
shall
be
ready
to
meet
all
the
requirements
of
the
occasion
so
at
least
i
trust
my
friend
therefore
was
premature
in
his
proposition
to
me
may
i
remind
him
of
that
incident
in
the
history
of
our
profession
when
a
very
learned
and
eminent
of
england
said
to
a
counsellor
at
the
bar
not
leap
before
you
come
to
the
stile
in
other
words
do
not
speak
to
a
point
until
the
point
has
arisen
the
point
which
the
senator
presents
to
me
had
not
yet
arisen
the
question
was
not
before
the
senate
whether
there
should
be
a
new
election
or
not
there
was
no
such
motion
nor
did
the
occasion
require
its
consideration
my
aim
was
in
all
simplicity
to
show
the
reasons
for
inquiry
now
it
may
be
that
when
that
inquiry
is
made
it
will
appear
that
i
am
mistaken
that
this
election
is
not
the
terrible
fraud
that
i
believe
it
that
the
loyal
people
black
and
white
will
hereafter
be
secure
in
the
state
of
virginia
under
the
proposed
constitution
it
may
be
that
all
that
will
become
apparent
on
the
report
of
your
committee
it
is
not
apparent
now
on
the
contrary
just
the
opposite
is
apparent
it
is
apparent
that
loyalists
will
not
be
secure
that
freedmen
will
suffer
unknown
peril
unless
you
now
throw
over
them
your
protecting
arm
that
is
my
object
i
wish
to
secure
safety
i
wish
to
surround
all
my
in
that
state
with
an
impenetrable
ægis
is
not
that
an
honest
desire
is
it
not
a
just
aspiration
i
know
that
my
friend
from
indiana
shares
it
with
me
i
claim
no
monopoly
of
it
but
i
mention
it
in
order
to
explain
the
argument
which
i
have
made
in
the
course
of
this
debate
there
has
been
an
iteration
of
assertion
on
certain
points
i
mention
two
one
of
fact
and
the
other
of
law
it
has
been
said
that
we
are
pledged
to
admit
virginia
and
this
assertion
has
been
repeated
in
every
variety
of
form
and
then
it
is
said
that
in
point
of
law
the
test
oath
is
not
required
now
to
both
these
assertions
whether
of
fact
or
law
i
reply
are
the
pledge
to
admit
virginia
can
not
be
shown
and
the
requirement
of
the
test
oath
can
be
shown
it
is
strange
to
see
the
forgetfulness
of
great
principles
into
which
senators
have
been
led
by
partisanship
certain
senators
forget
the
people
forget
the
lowly
only
to
remember
rebels
they
forget
that
our
constant
duty
is
to
protect
our
in
virginia
at
all
hazards
this
is
our
first
duty
which
can
not
be
postponed
in
the
reconstruction
of
virginia
it
must
be
an
touchstone
look
at
the
text
of
the
reconstruction
acts
or
their
spirit
and
it
is
the
same
by
their
text
the
first
and
commanding
duty
is
peace
and
good
order
should
be
enforced
in
said
states
loyal
and
republican
state
governments
can
be
legally
and
until
then
civil
governments
which
may
exist
therein
shall
be
deemed
only
and
in
all
respects
subject
to
the
paramount
authority
of
the
united
states
at
any
time
to
abolish
modify
control
or
supersede
the
such
are
the
duties
and
powers
devolved
upon
congress
by
the
very
terms
of
the
first
reconstruction
act
the
duty
is
to
see
that
and
republican
state
be
established
and
the
power
is
abolish
modify
control
or
the
provisional
governments
it
is
not
enough
to
say
that
virginia
has
performed
certain
things
required
by
the
statute
this
is
not
enough
the
senate
must
be
satisfied
that
her
government
is
loyal
and
republican
this
opens
the
question
of
fact
is
virginia
loyal
is
her
legislature
loyal
is
the
new
government
loyal
these
questions
must
be
answered
how
is
the
fact
do
not
tell
me
that
virginia
has
complied
with
certain
formal
requirements
behind
all
these
is
the
great
requirement
of
loyalty
let
senators
who
insist
upon
her
present
swift
admission
show
this
loyalty
there
is
no
plighted
faith
of
congress
which
can
supersede
this
duty
disloyalty
is
like
fraud
it
vitiates
the
whole
proceeding
such
is
the
plain
meaning
of
the
text
in
its
words
but
if
we
look
at
the
spirit
of
the
acts
the
conclusion
becomes
still
more
irresistible
it
is
contrary
to
reason
and
to
common
sense
to
suppose
that
congress
intended
to
blind
its
eyes
and
tie
its
hands
so
that
it
could
see
nothing
and
do
nothing
although
the
state
continued
disloyal
to
the
core
and
yet
this
is
the
argument
of
senators
who
set
up
the
pretension
of
plighted
faith
there
is
virginia
with
a
constitution
dabbled
in
blood
with
a
legislature
smoking
with
rebellion
and
with
a
governor
commending
himself
to
rebels
throughout
a
long
canvass
by
promising
to
strike
at
common
schools
and
here
is
congress
blindfold
and
with
hands
tied
behind
the
back
such
is
the
picture
to
look
at
it
is
enough
sir
the
case
is
clear
too
clear
for
argument
congress
is
not
blindfold
nor
are
its
hands
tied
congress
must
see
and
it
must
act
but
the
loyalty
of
a
state
should
be
like
the
sun
in
the
heavens
so
that
all
can
see
it
at
present
we
see
nothing
but
disloyalty
the
next
assertion
concerns
the
test
oath
and
on
this
point
i
desire
to
be
precise
general
canby
the
military
commander
in
virginia
thought
that
the
test
oath
or
should
be
required
in
the
organization
of
the
virginia
legislature
this
opinion
was
given
after
careful
examination
of
the
statutes
and
was
reaffirmed
by
him
at
different
times
according
to
him
the
test
oath
must
be
applied
until
the
constitution
has
been
approved
by
congress
and
in
one
of
his
letters
the
commander
says
application
to
the
seceded
states
before
they
were
represented
in
congress
appears
to
be
the
natural
result
of
their
political
relation
to
the
union
independent
of
the
requirements
of
the
ninth
section
of
the
law
of
july
to
my
mind
this
opinion
is
unanswerable
and
it
is
reinforced
by
the
reason
assigned
nothing
could
be
more
natural
than
that
the
test
oath
which
was
expressly
required
of
the
boards
of
registration
and
of
other
functionaries
should
be
required
of
the
legislature
so
long
as
the
same
was
within
the
power
of
congress
the
reason
for
it
in
one
case
was
equally
applicable
in
the
other
case
nay
it
was
stronger
if
possible
in
the
case
of
the
legislature
inasmuch
as
the
powers
of
the
latter
are
the
most
vital
it
is
this
legislature
which
is
to
begin
the
new
state
government
two
essential
parts
of
the
system
depend
upon
it
the
courts
of
justice
which
are
to
be
reorganized
and
the
common
schools
to
my
mind
it
is
contrary
to
reason
that
the
establishment
and
control
of
these
two
great
agencies
should
be
committed
to
a
disloyal
legislature
in
other
words
to
a
legislature
that
can
not
take
the
test
oath
the
requirement
of
this
oath
is
only
a
natural
and
reasonable
precaution
without
harshness
or
proscription
it
is
simply
for
the
sake
of
security
therefore
is
general
canby
clearly
right
on
grounds
of
reason
looking
at
the
text
of
the
reconstruction
acts
the
conclusion
of
reason
is
confirmed
by
a
positive
requirement
by
the
ninth
section
of
the
act
of
july
it
is
provided
all
members
of
said
boards
of
registration
and
all
persons
hereafter
elected
or
appointed
to
office
in
said
military
districts
any
state
or
municipal
shall
be
required
to
take
and
to
subscribe
the
oath
of
office
prescribed
by
law
for
officers
of
the
united
senators
find
ambiguity
in
the
terms
any
or
municipal
but
i
submit
sir
that
this
is
because
they
do
not
sufficiently
regard
the
whole
series
of
reconstruction
acts
and
construe
these
words
in
their
light
if
there
be
any
ambiguity
it
is
removed
by
other
words
which
furnish
a
precise
and
unassailable
definition
of
the
term
state
by
the
reconstruction
act
of
march
it
is
provided
until
the
people
of
said
rebel
states
shall
be
by
law
admitted
to
representation
in
the
congress
of
the
united
states
any
civil
governments
which
may
exist
therein
shall
be
deemed
and
in
all
respects
subject
to
the
paramount
authority
of
the
united
this
is
clear
and
precise
until
the
people
are
admitted
to
representation
the
state
government
is
only
or
in
other
words
it
is
a
state
now
the
legislature
was
elected
under
state
authority
that
is
under
a
state
constitution
which
was
therefore
according
to
the
very
text
of
the
reconstruction
acts
one
interpreting
another
must
this
test
oath
be
required
if
it
be
insisted
that
the
legislature
was
not
elected
under
state
authority
pray
under
what
authority
was
it
elected
perhaps
it
will
be
said
of
the
united
states
then
surely
it
would
fall
under
the
general
requirement
of
the
act
of
july
prescribing
the
test
oath
to
all
officers
of
the
united
states
but
i
insist
upon
this
application
of
the
statute
only
in
reply
to
those
who
would
exclude
the
legislature
from
the
requirement
of
the
reconstruction
act
i
can
not
doubt
that
it
comes
precisely
and
specifically
within
this
requirement
this
conclusion
is
enforced
by
three
additional
arguments
by
a
resolution
of
congress
bearing
date
february
the
provisional
governments
of
virginia
and
texas
it
is
declared
the
persons
now
holding
civil
offices
in
the
provisional
governments
of
virginia
and
texas
who
can
not
take
and
subscribe
the
oath
prescribed
by
the
act
entitled
act
to
prescribe
an
oath
of
office
and
for
other
purposes
approved
july
shall
on
the
passage
of
this
resolution
be
removed
by
these
plain
words
is
the
purpose
of
congress
manifest
the
test
oath
is
prescribed
for
all
persons
civil
offices
in
the
provisional
government
of
but
by
requirement
in
the
first
reconstruction
act
the
provisional
government
lasts
until
the
state
is
admitted
to
representation
then
comes
a
rule
of
interpretation
requiring
that
words
shall
be
construed
res
magis
valeat
quam
in
other
words
so
that
the
object
shall
prevail
rather
than
perish
but
the
very
object
of
the
reconstruction
act
on
which
this
question
arises
was
to
keep
rebels
from
the
state
government
this
object
is
apparent
from
beginning
to
end
but
this
object
is
defeated
by
any
interpretation
disallowing
the
test
oath
then
comes
another
rule
of
interpretation
which
is
of
equal
obligation
it
is
that
we
are
always
to
incline
so
as
to
protect
liberty
and
right
and
this
rule
for
double
assurance
is
embodied
in
the
very
text
of
the
statute
whose
meaning
is
now
under
consideration
being
the
last
section
as
follows
all
the
provisions
of
this
act
and
of
the
acts
to
which
this
is
supplementary
shall
be
construed
liberally
to
the
end
that
all
the
intents
thereof
may
be
fully
and
perfectly
carried
following
this
rule
we
find
still
another
reason
for
so
interpreting
the
statute
as
to
require
the
test
oath
thus
by
the
reason
of
the
case
by
the
natural
signification
of
the
text
by
the
light
furnished
from
the
supplementary
statute
by
the
rule
of
interpretation
that
the
object
must
prevail
rather
than
perish
and
by
that
other
commanding
rule
which
requires
a
liberal
interpretation
favorable
to
liberty
and
human
rights
by
all
these
considerations
any
one
of
which
alone
is
enough
while
the
whole
make
a
combination
of
irresistible
infinite
force
are
we
bound
to
require
the
test
oath
there
is
one
remark
of
andrew
johnson
just
wise
and
patriotic
for
which
i
can
forget
many
derelictions
of
duty
when
he
said
the
rebels
back
i
borrow
this
language
the
time
will
come
when
rebels
will
be
welcome
to
the
full
copartnership
of
government
but
this
can
be
only
when
all
are
secure
in
their
rights
until
then
the
rebels
back
january
the
long
debate
terminated
with
an
arraignment
by
trumbull
of
course
in
reference
not
only
to
the
pending
bill
but
to
former
measures
of
reconstruction
and
an
answer
of
similar
scope
by
sumner
concluding
with
regard
to
virginia
as
follows
the
next
count
in
the
indictment
was
that
i
had
called
the
late
election
in
virginia
a
fraud
and
how
did
he
encounter
this
truthful
allegation
he
proceeded
to
show
that
general
canby
designated
only
five
counties
in
which
there
were
cases
of
fraud
is
that
an
answer
to
my
entirely
different
allegation
does
the
senator
misunderstand
me
or
is
it
an
unintentional
change
of
issue
my
statement
was
entirely
different
from
that
which
he
attributes
to
me
i
made
no
allegation
of
frauds
in
different
counties
be
they
few
or
many
i
said
that
the
election
in
the
whole
state
was
carried
by
a
conspiracy
reaching
from
one
end
of
the
state
to
the
other
of
which
the
candidate
for
governor
was
the
head
to
obtain
the
control
of
the
state
and
by
this
means
take
the
loyalists
away
from
the
protecting
arms
of
congress
that
was
my
allegation
is
that
met
by
saying
to
me
that
i
do
not
adduce
evidence
of
fraud
in
districts
or
that
there
were
only
five
districts
with
regard
to
which
we
have
such
evidence
how
do
i
know
that
if
you
should
go
into
an
inquiry
you
might
not
find
that
very
evidence
with
regard
to
all
the
districts
the
senator
sets
his
face
against
inquiry
as
we
all
know
but
i
did
not
intend
to
open
this
question
my
object
was
entirely
different
it
was
to
show
that
from
beginning
to
end
the
whole
canvass
was
a
gigantic
fraud
that
walker
by
a
fraudulent
conspiracy
imposed
himself
upon
the
state
that
by
appeals
to
the
rebels
he
obtained
their
votes
and
thus
installed
himself
in
power
with
the
understanding
that
when
once
installed
he
should
administer
the
state
in
their
interest
then
sir
farewell
the
equal
rights
of
all
farewell
an
equal
judiciary
which
is
the
palladium
of
just
government
farewell
trial
by
jury
farewell
suffrage
for
all
farewell
that
system
of
public
schools
which
is
essential
to
the
welfare
of
the
community
all
sacrificed
to
this
conspiracy
such
sir
is
my
allegation
and
it
was
in
making
this
allegation
i
challenged
reply
i
challenge
it
now
when
i
first
made
it
i
looked
about
the
senate
i
looked
at
those
who
are
most
strenuous
for
this
sacrifice
and
none
answered
none
can
answer
the
evidence
is
before
the
senate
in
the
speeches
of
the
governor
and
in
the
election
sir
shall
i
follow
the
senator
in
other
things
i
hesitate
i
began
by
saying
i
would
not
follow
him
in
his
personalities
i
began
by
saying
that
i
would
meet
the
counts
of
his
indictment
one
by
one
precisely
on
the
facts
have
i
not
done
so
turning
neither
to
the
right
nor
to
the
left
i
have
no
taste
for
controversy
much
rather
would
i
give
the
little
of
strength
that
now
remains
for
me
to
the
direct
advocacy
of
those
great
principles
to
which
my
life
in
humble
measure
has
been
dedicated
not
forgetting
any
of
my
other
duties
as
a
senator
if
i
have
in
any
respect
failed
i
regret
it
let
me
say
in
all
simplicity
i
have
done
much
less
than
i
wish
i
had
i
have
failed
often
oh
how
often
when
i
wish
i
had
prevailed
no
one
can
regret
it
more
than
i
but
i
have
been
constant
and
earnest
always
such
god
willing
such
i
mean
to
be
to
the
end
and
now
sir
as
i
stand
before
the
senate
trying
by
a
last
effort
to
prevent
the
sacrifice
of
unionists
white
and
black
in
virginia
i
feel
that
i
am
discharging
only
a
simple
duty
to
do
less
would
be
wretched
failure
i
must
persevere
this
cause
i
have
at
heart
this
people
i
long
to
save
this
great
state
of
virginia
i
long
to
secure
as
a
true
and
loyal
state
in
the
national
union
show
that
such
is
her
character
and
no

sumner
said
president
i
have
already
during
this
session
introduced
a
bill
providing
for
the
extension
of
the
national
banking
system
and
the
withdrawal
of
greenbacks
in
proportion
to
the
new
issued
thus
preparing
the
way
for
specie
payments
the
more
i
reflect
upon
this
simple
proposition
the
more
i
am
satisfied
of
its
value
it
promises
to
be
as
efficacious
as
it
is
unquestionably
simple
but
it
does
not
pretend
to
deal
with
the
whole
financial
problem
the
bill
which
i
now
introduce
is
more
comprehensive
in
character
while
embodying
the
original
proposition
of
substituting
for
greenbacks
it
provides
for
the
refunding
and
consolidation
of
the
national
debt
in
such
a
way
as
to
make
it
easy
to
bear
while
it
brings
the
existing
currency
to
a
par
with
coin
in
making
this
attempt
i
am
moved
by
the
desire
to
do
something
for
the
business
interests
of
the
country
which
suffer
inconceivably
from
the
derangement
of
the
currency
whether
at
home
or
abroad
it
is
the
same
at
home
values
are
uncertain
abroad
commerce
is
disturbed
and
out
of
gear
political
reconstruction
is
not
enough
there
must
be
financial
reconstruction
also
the
peace
which
we
covet
must
enter
into
our
finances
the
reconciliation
which
we
long
for
must
embrace
the
disordered
business
of
the
country
in
any
measure
having
this
object
there
are
two
things
which
must
not
be
forgotten
first
the
preservation
of
the
national
credit
and
secondly
the
reduction
of
existing
taxation
happily
there
is
a
universal
prevailing
sentiment
for
the
national
credit
showing
itself
in
a
fixed
determination
that
it
shall
be
maintained
at
all
hazards
nobody
can
exaggerate
the
value
of
this
determination
which
is
the
of
financial
reconstruction
on
the
reduction
of
taxation
there
is
at
present
more
difference
of
opinion
but
i
can
not
doubt
that
here
too
there
will
be
a
speedy
harmony
the
country
is
uneasy
under
the
heavy
burden
willingly
gladly
patriotically
it
submitted
to
this
burden
while
the
republic
was
in
peril
but
now
there
is
a
yearning
for
relief
war
taxes
should
not
be
peace
taxes
and
so
long
as
the
present
system
continues
there
is
a
constant
and
painful
memento
of
war
while
business
halts
in
chains
and
life
bends
under
the
load
the
national
credit
being
safe
relief
from
the
pressure
of
existing
taxation
is
the
first
practical
object
in
our
finances
but
so
entirely
natural
and
consistent
is
this
object
that
it
harmonizes
with
all
other
proper
objects
especially
with
the
refunding
of
the
national
debt
and
with
specie
payments
as
the
people
feel
easy
in
their
affairs
they
will
be
ready
for
the
work
of
reconstruction
therefore
do
i
say
as
an
essential
stage
in
what
we
all
desire
with
the
taxes
the
proper
reduction
of
taxation
involves
two
other
things
first
the
reduction
of
the
present
annual
interest
on
the
national
debt
thus
affording
immense
relief
and
secondly
the
spread
or
extension
of
the
national
debt
over
succeeding
generations
for
whom
as
well
as
for
ourselves
it
was
incurred
the
practical
value
of
the
first
is
apparent
on
the
simple
statement
the
second
may
be
less
apparent
as
it
opens
a
question
of
policy
on
both
sides
of
which
much
has
been
already
said
nobody
doubts
the
brilliancy
of
the
movement
to
pay
off
the
national
debt
calling
to
mind
the
charge
of
the
six
hundred
at
balaclava
riding
into
the
jaws
of
death
so
that
the
beholder
exclaimed
in
memorable
words
is
magnificent
but
it
is
not
in
other
words
it
was
a
feat
of
hardihood
and
immolation
abnormal
eccentric
and
beyond
even
the
terrible
requirements
of
battle
in
similar
spirit
might
a
beholder
witnessing
the
present
sacrifice
of
our
people
in
the
redemption
of
a
debt
so
large
a
part
of
which
justly
belongs
to
posterity
exclaim
is
magnificent
but
it
is
not
unquestionably
business
requires
that
we
should
meet
existing
obligations
according
to
their
letter
and
spirit
but
it
does
not
require
payment
in
advance
nor
payment
of
obligations
resting
upon
others
to
do
this
is
magnificent
but
beyond
the
line
of
business
president
lincoln
in
one
of
his
earliest
propositions
of
emancipation
before
he
had
determined
upon
the
great
proclamation
contemplated
compensation
to
and
in
order
to
commend
this
large
expenditure
went
into
an
elaborate
calculation
to
show
how
easy
it
would
be
if
proportioned
upon
the
giant
shoulders
of
posterity
dismissing
the
idea
of
payment
by
the
existing
generation
he
proceeded
to
exhibit
the
growing
capacity
of
the
country
how
from
the
beginning
there
had
been
a
decennial
increase
in
population
of
per
how
during
a
period
of
seventy
years
the
ratio
had
never
been
two
per
cent
below
or
two
per
cent
above
this
average
thus
attesting
the
inflexibility
of
this
law
of
increase
assuming
its
continuance
he
proceeded
to
show
that
in
our
population
would
be
in
it
would
be
in
it
would
be
and
in
it
would
be
while
in
it
would
amount
to
nobody
has
impeached
these
estimates
there
they
stand
in
that
presidential
message
as
colossal
of
the
republic
the
increase
in
material
resources
is
beyond
that
of
population
the
most
recent
calculation
founded
on
the
last
census
shows
that
for
the
previous
decade
it
was
at
the
rate
of
eighty
per
although
other
calculations
have
placed
it
as
high
as
one
hundred
and
per
cent
whether
the
one
or
the
other
the
rate
of
increase
is
enormous
and
unless
arrested
in
some
way
not
now
foreseen
it
must
carry
our
national
resources
to
a
fabulous
extent
what
is
a
burden
now
will
be
scarcely
a
weight
in
the
early
decades
of
the
next
century
when
a
population
counted
by
hundreds
of
millions
will
wield
resources
counted
by
thousands
of
millions
on
this
head
details
are
superfluous
all
must
see
at
once
the
irresistible
conclusion
it
is
much
in
this
discussion
when
we
have
ascertained
how
easy
it
will
be
for
posterity
to
bear
this
responsibility
but
the
case
is
strengthened
when
it
is
considered
that
the
war
was
for
the
life
of
the
republic
so
that
throughout
all
time
so
long
as
the
republic
endures
all
who
enjoy
its
transcendent
citizenship
will
share
the
benefits
should
they
not
contribute
to
the
unparalleled
cost
recent
estimates
deemed
to
be
moderate
and
reasonable
show
an
aggregate
destruction
of
wealth
or
diversion
of
industry
in
the
united
states
since
approximating
nine
thousand
millions
of
dollars
being
the
cost
of
the
war
or
in
other
words
the
cost
of
the
destruction
of
slavery
if
from
this
estimate
be
dropped
the
item
for
expenditures
and
loss
of
property
in
the
rebel
states
amounting
to
we
shall
have
as
the
of
cost
to
the
loyal
people
of
which
the
existing
national
debt
represents
less
than
half
thus
besides
precious
blood
beyond
any
calculation
of
arithmetic
the
present
generation
has
already
contributed
immensely
to
that
result
in
which
succeeding
generations
have
a
stake
even
greater
than
theirs
assuming
then
that
there
is
to
be
no
considerable
taxation
for
the
immediate
payment
of
the
debt
we
have
one
economy
if
to
this
be
added
another
economy
from
the
reduction
of
the
interest
we
shall
be
able
to
relieve
materially
all
the
business
interests
of
the
country
two
such
economies
will
be
of
infinite
value
to
the
people
whose
riches
will
be
proportionally
increased
in
the
development
of
wealth
next
to
making
money
is
saving
money
bearing
these
things
in
mind
financial
reconstruction
is
relieved
of
its
difficulties
it
only
remains
to
find
the
proper
machinery
or
process
and
here
we
encounter
the
propositions
of
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
in
his
annual
report
which
are
threefold
to
refund
twelve
hundred
millions
of
six
per
cent
bonds
in
four
and
a
half
per
cent
and
to
make
our
exports
equal
in
value
with
our
imports
and
to
restore
our
commercial
marine
to
regard
these
as
essential
conditions
of
reduced
taxation
and
specie
payments
considering
these
propositions
with
the
best
attention
i
could
give
to
them
i
have
been
impressed
by
their
inadequacy
as
a
system
at
the
present
moment
i
can
not
easily
consent
to
the
postponement
which
they
imply
they
hand
over
to
the
future
what
i
wish
to
see
accomplished
at
once
and
what
i
can
not
doubt
with
a
firm
will
can
be
accomplished
at
an
early
day
but
besides
this
capital
defect
apparent
on
the
face
i
find
in
the
system
proposed
no
assurance
of
success
will
it
work
i
doubt
here
i
wish
to
be
understood
as
expressing
myself
with
proper
caution
and
i
wish
further
to
declare
my
anxiety
to
obtain
the
substituted
loans
at
the
smallest
rate
of
interest
and
also
my
conviction
that
within
a
short
time
at
some
slight
present
cost
this
may
be
accomplished
looking
at
this
question
in
the
light
of
business
i
am
driven
to
the
conclusion
that
twelve
hundred
millions
of
six
per
cents
can
not
be
refunded
either
now
or
hereafter
in
four
or
four
and
a
half
per
cents
without
offering
compensation
in
an
additional
running
period
of
the
bonds
which
is
not
found
in
the
nor
in
the
proposed
by
the
secretary
with
such
bonds
there
would
be
a
practical
difficulty
in
the
way
of
any
such
refunding
to
any
considerable
amount
from
the
inability
to
command
a
sufficient
amount
of
coin
under
the
of
coin
which
must
accompany
the
offer
nor
is
there
any
fund
applicable
to
the
purchase
of
coin
in
open
market
were
such
a
course
desirable
obviously
to
induce
the
voluntary
relinquishment
of
bonds
at
a
high
rate
of
interest
for
other
bonds
at
a
less
rate
the
holders
must
be
offered
something
preferable
to
the
coin
tendered
as
an
alternative
the
time
has
passed
when
holders
can
be
menaced
with
payment
in
greenbacks
whatever
we
do
must
be
in
coin
or
in
some
bond
which
will
be
taken
rather
than
coin
the
attempt
at
too
low
a
rate
of
interest
would
cause
the
coin
to
be
taken
rather
than
the
bond
if
we
had
the
article
at
command
and
would
end
in
a
deluge
of
coin
sweeping
away
the
premium
on
gold
a
return
to
specie
payments
thus
precipitated
would
be
of
doubtful
value
if
not
illusive
without
other
and
sustaining
measures
in
the
suggestion
that
our
exports
must
be
augmented
and
our
commercial
marine
restored
i
sympathize
cordially
but
i
do
not
see
how
this
can
be
accomplished
so
long
as
the
present
taxation
is
maintained
exercising
such
a
depressing
influence
on
all
industry
making
the
necessaries
of
life
dearer
adding
to
the
cost
of
raw
material
and
generally
enhancing
the
price
of
our
products
so
as
to
prevent
them
from
competing
in
foreign
markets
with
the
products
of
other
nations
the
proposition
to
make
the
interest
on
the
new
bonds
payable
at
various
points
in
europe
at
the
option
of
the
holder
seems
unnecessary
while
it
is
open
to
objections
such
agencies
would
be
onerous
and
cumbersome
at
london
paris
frankfort
and
berlin
there
must
be
a
machinery
with
constant
complications
continuing
through
the
lifetime
of
the
bonds
to
secure
the
transfers
from
point
to
point
and
the
obligatory
remittances
in
gold
nor
am
i
sure
that
in
this
way
foreign
powers
might
not
obtain
a
certain
jurisdiction
over
our
monetary
transactions
but
i
confess
that
the
ruling
objection
with
me
is
of
a
different
character
new
york
is
our
commercial
centre
designated
by
providence
and
confirmed
by
man
already
it
has
made
a
great
advance
but
it
is
not
yet
quoted
abroad
as
one
of
the
clearing
points
of
the
world
at
new
york
quotations
are
obtained
daily
on
london
and
paris
but
in
these
places
no
such
recognized
quotations
can
be
now
obtained
on
new
york
that
the
agencies
proposed
will
tend
to
postpone
this
condition
is
a
sufficient
objection
i
have
made
these
remarks
with
hesitation
but
in
order
to
prepare
the
way
for
the
bill
which
i
have
introduced
it
was
my
duty
to
show
why
the
propositions
of
the
secretary
were
not
sufficient
for
the
occasion
and
this
i
have
tried
to
do
simply
and
frankly
it
is
long
since
i
avowed
my
conviction
that
specie
payments
should
be
resumed
and
i
should
now
do
less
than
my
duty
if
i
did
not
at
least
attempt
to
show
the
way
which
seems
to
me
so
natural
and
easy
while
the
present
system
continues
we
are
poor
the
payment
of
the
national
debt
and
the
accumulation
of
coin
in
the
treasury
are
the
signs
of
unparalleled
national
wealth
but
our
financial
condition
is
not
in
harmony
with
these
signs
the
latest
figures
from
the
treasury
are
such
as
no
other
nation
can
exhibit
from
these
it
appears
that
the
amount
of
bonds
purchased
since
march
for
the
sinking
fund
was
and
the
amount
purchased
subject
to
congress
being
in
all
the
same
proportion
of
purchase
for
january
and
february
would
be
making
a
of
for
one
year
and
notwithstanding
this
outlay
we
find
in
the
treasury
january
in
coin
no
less
than
and
in
currency
making
a
of
and
yet
with
these
tokens
of
national
resources
manifest
to
the
world
our
bonds
are
below
par
and
our
currency
is
inconvertible
paper
this
should
not
be
permitted
longer
with
all
these
resources
there
must
be
a
way
even
if
we
were
not
taught
that
a
will
always
finds
a
way
the
refunding
of
an
existing
loan
implies
two
distinct
and
independent
transactions
first
the
extinction
by
payment
in
some
form
of
the
existing
loan
and
secondly
the
negotiation
of
a
new
loan
to
an
amount
equal
to
that
extinguished
the
bill
now
before
the
senate
contemplates
the
prompt
extinguishment
of
the
of
but
i
would
not
have
this
important
work
entered
upon
until
the
government
is
fully
prepared
to
say
that
after
a
certain
period
of
notice
say
six
months
in
order
that
distant
holders
in
europe
may
be
advised
interest
on
the
of
shall
cease
and
the
bonds
be
forthwith
redeemed
in
coin
there
should
be
no
coercion
of
any
kind
upon
any
holder
at
home
or
abroad
to
induce
the
acceptance
of
a
substitute
bond
i
am
happy
to
believe
that
with
the
judicious
use
of
five
per
cent
all
the
coin
necessary
for
such
independent
action
may
be
assured
in
advance
believing
that
such
five
per
cent
bonds
will
be
regarded
by
investors
as
preferable
to
coin
i
would
give
the
holders
of
the
old
bonds
the
first
opportunity
to
subscribe
for
the
new
those
who
elect
coin
will
make
room
for
others
ready
to
give
coin
in
exchange
for
such
bonds
if
we
look
at
the
practical
consequences
we
shall
be
encouraged
in
this
course
the
refunding
of
the
sixes
of
being
upward
of
five
hundred
millions
in
fives
as
authorized
by
the
first
section
of
the
bill
contemplates
the
payment
from
present
funds
of
little
more
than
fourteen
millions
being
the
excess
of
above
the
five
hundred
millions
provided
for
the
annual
reduction
of
interest
on
that
loan
will
be
the
substitution
of
three
hundred
millions
of
fours
for
a
like
amount
of
sixes
as
provided
in
the
bill
will
operate
a
further
saving
of
making
a
of
or
near
twelve
millions
there
will
then
remain
but
subject
to
redemption
being
of
during
the
year
the
further
sum
of
being
of
will
fall
within
the
control
of
the
government
when
as
it
seems
to
me
and
according
to
the
contemplation
of
the
bill
the
credit
of
the
government
will
be
at
such
a
pitch
that
five
hundred
millions
can
be
refunded
in
four
and
a
half
per
with
the
addition
of
millions
paid
from
the
treasury
thus
insuring
a
further
annual
reduction
of
or
a
total
annual
saving
of
of
which
about
twelve
millions
may
be
saved
during
the
current
year
here
for
the
present
we
stop
our
debt
can
not
be
further
ameliorated
before
when
three
hundred
and
millions
being
of
will
become
redeemable
and
then
in
when
millions
being
of
and
constituting
the
balance
of
our
optional
sixes
will
become
redeemable
all
of
which
i
gladly
believe
may
be
refunded
in
the
four
per
cents
provided
by
the
present
bill
to
be
followed
in
by
a
reduction
of
the
original
into
similar
bonds
i
would
remark
here
that
the
bill
undertakes
to
deal
with
the
whole
disposable
national
debt
the
amounts
which
i
have
given
will
be
found
in
the
treasury
tables
of
january
and
are
irrespective
of
the
sinking
fund
and
invested
surplus
from
these
details
i
pass
to
consider
the
bill
in
its
aims
and
principles
the
proposition
with
which
i
begin
is
to
refund
our
six
per
cent
of
amounting
to
upward
of
five
hundred
millions
in
five
per
cent
in
taking
the
term
i
adopt
the
description
of
a
bond
well
known
and
popular
at
home
and
abroad
whose
payment
is
expressly
stipulated
by
the
original
act
authorizing
the
issue
the
bond
begins
with
a
good
name
which
will
commend
it
the
interest
which
i
propose
is
larger
than
i
would
propose
for
any
late
bond
it
is
important
if
not
necessary
in
order
to
counteract
the
suspicion
which
has
been
allowed
to
fall
upon
our
national
credit
even
our
sixes
are
now
below
par
in
europe
but
they
will
unquestionably
share
the
elevation
of
the
new
fives
substituted
our
first
attempt
should
be
with
the
latter
let
these
be
carried
to
par
and
we
shall
have
par
everywhere
in
this
process
the
first
stage
is
the
conviction
that
all
our
bonds
will
be
paid
in
the
universal
money
of
the
world
all
bonds
whether
fives
or
sixes
will
then
advance
i
know
no
way
in
which
this
conviction
can
be
created
so
promptly
and
easily
as
by
redeeming
in
gold
some
one
of
our
six
per
cent
loans
and
that
most
naturally
selected
is
the
first
which
is
already
so
noted
from
the
discussion
to
which
it
has
been
subjected
but
this
can
be
done
only
by
offering
to
holders
the
option
of
coin
or
a
satisfactory
substitute
bond
with
a
new
issue
of
five
per
cent
limited
in
amount
to
about
the
aggregate
of
the
six
per
cent
of
say
five
hundred
millions
i
can
not
doubt
that
every
foreign
holder
of
such
sixes
will
accept
the
fives
in
lieu
of
coin
and
so
much
of
that
loan
as
is
held
at
home
may
be
paid
in
coin
if
preferred
by
the
holders
from
the
proceeds
of
an
equal
amount
of
fives
placed
in
europe
at
par
for
coin
then
will
follow
the
advantage
of
this
positive
policy
the
national
credit
will
be
beyond
question
nobody
will
doubt
it
the
public
faith
will
be
vindicated
the
time
will
have
come
which
is
the
named
by
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
when
want
of
faith
in
the
will
be
removed
and
the
door
will
be
open
to
cheap
loans
this
will
be
of
course
it
can
not
be
otherwise
if
we
only
do
our
duty
our
fives
being
limited
in
amount
after
being
taken
at
par
in
preference
to
coin
will
advance
in
value
so
that
the
investment
will
become
popular
people
will
desire
more
but
there
will
be
no
more
so
that
without
difficulty
or
delay
we
may
hope
to
refund
five
hundred
millions
of
our
subsequent
sixes
or
so
much
as
may
be
desirable
at
four
and
a
half
per
cent
in
if
not
at
four
per
cent
in
in
this
operation
the
is
the
national
credit
with
this
all
is
easy
our
fives
will
at
once
ascend
above
par
while
a
market
is
opened
for
four
and
a
half
or
four
per
cents
the
stigma
of
repudiation
whether
breathed
in
doubt
or
hurled
in
taunt
will
be
silenced
there
are
other
fields
of
glory
than
in
war
and
such
a
triumph
will
be
among
the
most
important
in
the
annals
of
finance
but
to
this
end
there
must
be
no
hesitation
the
offer
must
be
plain
or
coin
giving
the
world
assurance
of
our
determination
the
answer
will
be
as
prompt
as
the
offer
and
not
in
the
process
of
financial
reconstruction
we
can
not
forget
the
national
banks
which
have
already
done
so
much
the
uniform
currency
which
they
supply
throughout
the
country
commends
them
to
our
care
accustomed
to
the
facilities
this
currency
supplies
it
is
difficult
to
understand
how
business
was
conducted
under
the
old
system
when
every
bank
had
its
separate
currency
taking
its
color
like
the
chameleon
from
what
was
about
it
so
that
there
were
as
many
currencies
with
as
many
colors
as
there
were
banks
two
things
must
be
done
for
the
national
banks
first
the
bonds
deposited
by
them
with
the
government
must
be
reduced
in
interest
and
secondly
the
system
must
be
extended
so
as
to
supply
facilities
especially
at
the
west
and
south
i
doubt
if
the
national
banks
can
expect
to
receive
in
the
future
more
than
four
per
cent
from
the
bonds
deposited
by
them
with
the
government
and
considering
the
profits
attributed
to
their
business
it
may
be
that
there
would
be
a
reluctant
consent
even
to
this
allowance
here
it
must
be
observed
that
the
whole
system
of
national
banks
is
founded
upon
the
bonds
of
the
nation
so
that
at
the
rate
of
liquidation
now
adopted
for
the
national
debt
the
system
will
be
without
support
in
the
lapse
of
twelve
or
fifteen
years
the
stability
of
the
banks
which
is
so
vital
alike
to
the
national
currency
and
to
the
pecuniary
interests
involved
in
the
business
can
be
assured
only
by
an
issue
of
bonds
for
a
longer
term
of
course
the
longer
the
period
the
more
valuable
the
bond
to
reduce
the
interest
arbitrarily
on
the
existing
short
bonds
of
the
banks
without
offering
compensation
in
some
form
would
be
positively
unjust
besides
being
an
infringement
of
the
guaranties
surrounding
such
bonds
and
therefore
a
violation
of
good
faith
a
substitute
bond
will
be
assurance
of
stability
for
this
length
of
time
while
the
additional
life
of
the
bond
will
be
a
compensation
for
the
reduction
of
interest
as
it
is
not
proposed
to
issue
such
bonds
immediately
except
for
banking
purposes
they
will
not
fall
below
par
and
this
par
will
be
coin
which
i
need
not
say
the
sixes
now
held
by
the
banks
will
not
command
if
through
the
failure
or
of
any
bank
an
amount
of
the
substituted
bonds
should
be
liberated
there
will
be
an
instant
demand
for
them
at
par
by
new
banks
arising
to
secure
the
relinquished
circulation
the
extension
of
from
three
to
five
hundred
millions
which
i
propose
will
extend
the
banking
system
where
it
is
now
needed
this
alone
is
much
how
long
the
senate
debated
this
question
at
the
last
session
without
any
practical
result
can
not
be
forgotten
that
debate
certifies
to
the
necessity
of
this
extension
the
proposition
i
offer
shows
how
it
may
be
accomplished
and
made
especially
beneficent
the
requirement
from
all
the
banks
of
new
four
per
cent
bonds
at
the
rate
of
one
hundred
dollars
for
eighty
dollars
of
notes
issued
and
to
be
issued
would
absorb
six
hundred
and
millions
of
the
national
debt
into
four
per
while
the
withdrawal
of
one
dollar
of
greenbacks
for
each
additional
dollar
of
notes
will
go
far
to
extinguish
the
outstanding
greenbacks
thus
quietly
and
without
any
appreciable
contraction
removing
an
impediment
to
specie
payments
naturally
as
by
a
process
of
gestation
will
this
birth
be
accomplished
it
will
come
and
nobody
can
prevent
it
in
presenting
this
series
of
measures
i
am
penetrated
by
the
conviction
that
if
adopted
they
can
not
fail
to
bring
all
the
national
obligations
to
a
par
with
coin
and
then
specie
payments
will
be
resumed
without
effort
our
bonds
will
be
among
the
most
popular
in
the
market
no
longer
below
par
they
will
continue
to
advance
while
the
national
credit
lifts
its
head
unimpeached
unimpeachable
under
this
influence
the
remainder
of
our
outstanding
debt
may
be
refunded
in
at
four
and
a
half
per
if
not
in
at
four
per
cent
there
will
then
be
sixteen
hundred
and
millions
refunded
at
an
average
of
less
than
four
and
a
half
per
and
the
whole
debt
including
the
irredeemable
sixes
of
at
an
average
of
less
than
five
per
while
all
will
be
within
our
control
five
years
earlier
than
in
the
maximum
period
proposed
by
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
one
immediate
consequence
of
these
measures
would
be
the
relief
of
the
people
from
eighty
to
one
hundred
millions
of
taxation
while
there
would
remain
a
surplus
revenue
of
two
millions
a
month
applicable
to
the
reduction
of
the
debt
being
more
than
enough
to
liquidate
the
whole
prior
to
the
maturity
of
the
new
obligations
if
it
were
thought
advisable
to
complete
the
liquidation
at
so
early
a
day
the
country
will
breathe
freer
business
will
be
more
elastic
life
will
be
easier
as
the
assurance
goes
forth
that
no
heavy
taxation
shall
be
continued
in
order
to
pay
the
debt
in
eleven
years
as
is
now
proposed
nor
in
fifteen
years
nor
in
twenty
years
by
the
present
measures
while
retaining
the
privilege
of
paying
the
debt
within
twenty
years
we
shall
secure
the
alternative
of
sixty
years
and
at
a
largely
reduced
interest
leaving
the
opportunity
of
paying
it
at
any
intermediate
time
according
to
the
best
advantage
of
the
country
with
diminished
taxation
and
resources
increasing
immeasurably
the
national
debt
will
cease
to
be
a
burden
becoming
by
degrees
and
beautifully
until
it
gradually
ceases
to
exist
in
making
this
statement
i
offer
my
contribution
to
the
settlement
of
a
great
question
if
i
am
wrong
what
i
have
said
will
soon
be
forgotten
meanwhile
i
ask
for
it
your
candid
attention
adding
one
further
remark
with
which
i
shall
close
i
never
have
doubted
i
can
not
doubt
the
ease
with
which
the
transition
to
specie
payments
may
be
accomplished
especially
as
compared
with
the
ominous
fears
which
this
simple
proposition
seems
to
excite
in
certain
quarters
we
are
gravely
warned
against
it
as
a
period
of
crisis
i
do
not
believe
there
will
be
anything
to
which
this
term
can
be
reasonably
applied
like
every
measure
of
essential
justice
it
will
at
once
harmonize
with
the
life
of
the
community
and
people
will
be
astonished
at
the
long
postponement
of
an
act
so
truly
beneficent
in
all
its
influences
so
important
to
the
national
character
and
so
congenial
with
the
business
interests
of
the
country
the
bill
was
ordered
to
be
printed
and
referred
to
the
committee
on
finance
january
a
bill
from
the
committee
on
finance
provide
a
national
currency
of
coin
notes
and
to
equalize
the
distribution
of
circulating
notes
being
under
consideration
sumner
moved
an
amendment
embracing
the
provisions
of
his
bill
with
the
exception
of
the
first
second
and
seventh
sections
as
a
substitute
in
support
of
which
he
the
next
day
spoke
as
follows
president
some
things
seem
to
be
admitted
in
this
debate
as
at
least
if
i
may
judge
from
the
remarks
of
the
senator
from
ohio
sherman
one
of
these
is
the
unequal
distribution
of
the
currency
and
another
is
that
to
take
from
the
northern
and
eastern
banks
circulation
already
awarded
to
them
would
disturb
trade
i
venture
to
add
that
the
remedy
would
be
worse
than
the
disease
the
senator
from
wisconsin
howe
and
the
senator
from
kentucky
davis
justly
claim
for
the
west
and
south
a
fair
proportion
of
bank
circulation
the
senator
from
indiana
morton
demands
more
while
neither
asks
for
expansion
neither
is
ready
for
contraction
the
senator
argues
that
at
this
time
the
currency
is
not
too
much
for
the
area
of
country
and
the
amount
of
business
which
from
the
new
spaces
opened
to
settlement
and
the
increase
of
commerce
require
facilities
beyond
those
that
are
adequate
in
thickly
settled
and
wealthy
communities
his
premises
may
be
in
the
main
sound
but
he
might
have
made
a
further
application
of
them
if
in
the
absence
of
local
banks
and
banking
facilities
a
larger
amount
of
circulation
is
needed
and
i
do
not
mean
to
question
this
assertion
would
it
not
follow
that
the
establishment
of
such
local
banks
and
banking
facilities
with
new
bank
credits
checks
of
depositors
and
other
agencies
of
exchange
and
with
the
increase
of
circulation
would
more
than
counterbalance
any
slight
contraction
from
the
withdrawal
of
greenbacks
and
that
thus
we
should
be
tending
toward
specie
payments
the
senator
from
kentucky
said
aptly
that
if
we
wait
until
all
are
ready
we
shall
never
resume
if
the
senator
from
indiana
is
right
in
saying
that
prices
have
already
settled
down
in
the
expectation
of
an
early
resumption
then
to
my
mind
the
battle
is
half
won
and
we
have
only
to
proceed
always
in
the
right
direction
a
simple
redistribution
of
the
existing
currency
can
not
be
made
without
serious
consequences
to
the
business
of
the
country
while
it
will
do
nothing
to
correct
the
evils
of
our
present
financial
condition
it
will
do
nothing
for
financial
reconstruction
nor
will
these
consequences
be
confined
to
any
geographical
section
they
will
affect
the
south
and
west
as
well
as
the
north
and
east
i
need
only
add
that
disturbance
in
new
york
means
disturbance
everywhere
in
our
country
nor
is
it
easy
to
see
how
any
redistribution
can
be
made
which
however
just
may
not
be
unjust
as
business
develops
and
population
extends
there
will
be
new
demand
with
new
inequalities
and
new
disturbances
the
original
banking
act
authorized
a
circulation
of
a
large
part
of
which
went
to
the
northern
and
eastern
states
all
this
was
very
natural
for
at
that
time
there
was
no
demand
at
the
south
and
comparatively
little
at
the
west
with
the
supply
of
capital
at
the
east
banks
were
promptly
formed
even
before
the
state
banks
were
permitted
to
come
into
the
new
system
subsequently
the
state
banks
were
not
only
permitted
to
come
into
the
new
system
but
their
circulation
was
taxed
out
of
existence
here
then
was
banking
capital
idle
it
was
reasonable
that
the
circulation
which
was
not
demanded
in
other
parts
of
the
country
should
be
allotted
to
these
banks
this
i
state
in
simple
justice
to
these
banks
i
might
remind
you
also
of
the
patriotic
service
rendered
by
the
banks
of
new
york
boston
and
philadelphia
which
in
furnished
the
means
by
which
our
forces
were
organized
against
the
rebellion
one
hundred
and
fifty
millions
in
gold
were
furnished
by
these
banks
of
which
less
than
fifty
millions
were
subsequently
subscribed
by
the
people
and
this
was
at
a
moment
when
the
national
securities
had
received
a
terrible
shock
not
from
the
south
not
from
the
west
did
financial
succor
come
at
that
time
in
considering
briefly
the
questions
presented
by
the
pending
measure
i
shall
take
them
in
their
order
they
are
two
first
to
enlarge
the
national
bank
currency
and
secondly
to
create
a
system
of
free
banking
founded
on
coin
notes
this
leaves
out
of
view
the
question
of
refunding
and
consolidating
the
national
debt
nor
does
it
touch
the
great
question
of
specie
payments
i
begin
with
the
proposed
enlargement
of
the
currency
the
object
is
excellent
as
is
admitted
by
all
but
the
practical
question
arises
on
the
way
it
shall
be
done
if
you
look
at
the
bill
now
before
the
senate
you
will
see
that
it
authorizes
an
enlargement
to
the
extent
of
and
the
withdrawal
to
that
amount
of
what
are
called
three
per
cent
temporary
loan
certificates
of
which
little
more
than
this
amount
exists
the
extinction
of
this
debt
will
accomplish
an
annual
saving
of
about
so
far
so
good
this
amount
of
is
allotted
to
banks
organized
in
states
and
territories
having
less
than
their
proportion
under
the
general
banking
act
this
is
right
and
it
removes
to
a
certain
extent
objections
successfully
urged
at
the
last
session
of
congress
against
a
measure
for
the
redistribution
of
currency
but
plainly
and
obviously
the
measure
of
relief
proposed
is
not
sufficient
to
meet
the
just
demands
of
the
south
and
west
nor
is
it
sufficient
to
prevent
taking
from
the
north
and
east
a
portion
of
the
currency
now
enjoyed
by
them
therefore
in
one
part
of
the
country
it
will
be
inadequate
while
in
another
it
is
unjust
inadequacy
and
injustice
are
bad
recommendations
when
a
complete
remedy
is
in
our
power
why
propose
a
partial
remedy
when
a
just
remedy
is
in
our
power
why
propose
an
unjust
remedy
there
is
another
question
i
would
ask
also
why
unnecessarily
disturb
existing
and
channels
of
trade
for
such
must
be
the
effect
of
a
new
apportionment
as
proposed
under
the
census
of
this
year
why
not
at
once
provide
another
source
from
which
to
draw
the
new
supplies
under
the
new
apportionment
i
open
this
subject
with
these
inquiries
which
to
my
mind
answer
themselves
the
proposition
of
the
committee
is
further
embarrassed
by
the
provision
for
the
cancellation
each
month
of
the
three
per
cent
certificates
to
an
amount
equal
to
the
aggregate
of
new
notes
issued
during
the
previous
month
in
order
to
judge
the
expediency
of
this
measure
we
must
understand
the
origin
and
character
of
these
certificates
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
desiring
to
avoid
the
further
issue
of
greenbacks
conceived
the
idea
of
a
note
which
could
be
used
in
the
payment
of
government
obligations
but
in
such
form
as
not
to
enter
into
and
inflate
the
currency
this
resulted
in
an
note
payable
three
years
after
date
with
six
per
cent
interest
compounded
every
six
months
and
payable
at
the
maturity
of
the
note
in
its
redemption
this
anomalous
note
was
made
for
its
face
value
only
it
was
not
doubted
that
such
notes
on
the
accumulation
of
interest
would
be
withdrawn
as
an
investment
being
if
they
were
allowed
to
be
used
by
the
banks
as
part
of
their
reserves
they
would
become
contrary
to
the
original
purpose
part
of
the
national
circulation
while
the
government
would
be
paying
interest
on
bank
reserves
which
no
bank
could
demand
but
the
of
the
secretary
could
not
prevent
their
use
by
the
banks
as
part
of
the
reserves
the
intervention
of
congress
was
required
which
by
the
second
section
of
the
loan
act
of
june
provided
as
follows
shall
any
treasury
note
bearing
interest
issued
under
this
act
be
a
legal
tender
in
payment
or
redemption
of
any
notes
issued
by
any
bank
banking
association
or
banker
calculated
or
intended
to
circulate
as
from
this
statement
it
seems
clear
that
neither
the
secretary
originating
these
notes
nor
the
act
of
congress
authorizing
them
nor
the
banks
receiving
them
contemplated
their
employment
as
part
of
the
bank
reserves
how
they
reached
this
condition
remains
to
be
told
the
whole
issue
of
the
notes
amounted
to
upward
of
two
hundred
and
seventeen
millions
these
were
funded
at
or
before
maturity
except
some
fifty
millions
which
as
they
matured
were
exchanged
for
certificates
to
that
amount
bearing
three
per
cent
interest
and
constituted
part
of
the
bank
reserves
here
was
an
innovation
as
improvident
as
new
being
nothing
less
than
bank
reserves
on
interest
this
improvidence
was
increased
by
the
manner
of
distribution
which
instead
of
being
ratable
seems
to
have
been
according
to
the
rule
of
speaks
first
of
course
the
banks
within
easy
access
of
washington
had
peculiar
opportunities
by
which
they
were
enabled
to
secure
these
notes
and
thus
obtain
interest
on
part
of
their
reserves
while
banks
at
a
distance
and
especially
in
the
country
were
not
equal
in
opportunity
besides
its
partiality
this
provision
operates
like
a
gratuity
to
the
banks
having
these
notes
obviously
these
three
per
cent
certificates
ought
to
be
withdrawn
but
i
do
not
like
to
see
their
withdrawal
conditioned
on
the
extension
of
banking
facilities
their
case
is
peculiar
and
they
should
be
treated
accordingly
nor
should
their
accidental
amount
be
made
the
measure
of
banking
facilities
they
constitute
a
part
of
the
national
debt
and
should
be
considered
in
the
refunding
and
consolidation
of
this
debt
and
not
on
a
bill
to
provide
banking
facilities
i
think
i
do
not
err
if
i
conclude
that
the
first
part
of
the
pending
measure
is
inadequate
while
the
cancellation
of
the
three
per
cent
certificates
in
the
manner
proposed
is
inexpedient
all
this
is
more
observable
when
it
is
considered
that
there
is
another
way
ample
and
natural
from
the
first
part
of
the
pending
measure
i
pass
to
the
second
part
being
sections
three
four
and
five
which
if
i
am
not
mistaken
authorize
free
banking
with
coin
notes
as
a
declared
basis
of
coin
this
is
plausible
but
to
my
mind
illusory
and
impracticable
the
machine
will
not
work
but
if
it
does
work
its
first
and
most
obvious
operation
will
be
to
create
a
new
currency
adding
a
third
to
the
greenbacks
and
already
existing
besides
creating
a
new
class
of
banks
here
i
put
the
practical
question
can
any
national
bank
issue
and
maintain
a
circulation
of
coin
notes
with
a
reserve
of
only
per
so
long
as
gold
commands
a
premium
how
long
would
the
reserve
last
it
is
easy
to
see
that
until
specie
payments
this
idea
is
impracticable
it
will
not
work
in
proportion
to
the
premium
on
gold
would
be
the
run
on
the
banks
until
their
outstanding
notes
were
redeemed
or
their
vaults
emptied
but
the
measure
is
not
only
impracticable
it
is
inexpedient
as
multiplying
instead
of
simplifying
the
forms
of
currency
we
have
now
two
paper
currencies
distinct
in
form
and
with
different
attributes
everybody
feels
that
this
is
unfortunate
and
yet
it
is
now
proposed
to
add
another
surely
it
is
the
dictate
of
wisdom
instead
of
creating
a
third
paper
currency
to
disembarrass
the
country
of
one
of
those
now
existing
and
make
the
other
convertible
into
coin
so
that
we
may
hereafter
enjoy
one
uniform
currency
i
confess
my
constant
desire
for
measures
to
withdraw
our
greenbacks
and
to
make
our
present
coin
notes
coin
notes
should
be
universal
under
any
circumstances
the
conclusion
is
irresistible
that
the
proposed
plan
if
not
utterly
impracticable
is
a
too
partial
and
timid
experiment
calculated
to
exercise
very
little
influence
over
the
great
question
of
specie
payments
if
i
am
right
in
this
review
the
bill
of
the
committee
does
not
deserve
our
support
but
i
do
not
confine
myself
to
criticism
i
offer
a
substitute
could
i
have
my
way
i
would
treat
the
whole
financial
question
as
a
unit
providing
at
the
same
time
for
all
the
points
involved
in
what
i
have
called
financial
reconstruction
this
i
have
attempted
in
the
bill
which
i
have
already
introduced
but
on
the
present
occasion
i
content
myself
with
a
substitute
for
the
present
measure
the
amendment
of
which
i
have
given
notice
has
the
twofold
object
of
the
pending
bill
first
to
enlarge
the
currency
and
secondly
to
change
the
existing
banking
system
so
as
to
provide
practically
for
free
banking
and
to
enlarge
banking
facilities
if
you
will
look
at
my
amendment
you
will
see
that
it
enlarges
the
limit
of
from
to
this
is
practically
a
provision
for
free
banking
at
least
for
some
years
practically
it
leaves
the
volume
of
currency
to
be
regulated
by
legitimate
demand
with
a
proviso
for
the
withdrawal
of
notes
to
an
amount
equal
to
the
new
issues
the
amendment
then
proceeds
to
provide
bonds
to
be
deposited
with
the
government
as
the
basis
of
the
new
banks
and
here
is
a
just
and
economy
just
to
the
government
and
not
unjust
to
the
banks
it
is
proposed
for
the
future
to
allow
but
four
per
cent
interest
on
the
bonds
deposited
by
the
banks
thus
far
the
banks
have
enjoyed
large
benefits
and
in
part
at
the
expense
of
the
government
under
the
operation
of
my
amendment
these
profits
would
be
slightly
reduced
but
not
unduly
while
the
treasury
would
receive
an
annual
benefit
of
not
far
from
six
million
dollars
in
coin
in
this
respect
the
proposition
harmonizes
with
the
idea
which
is
constantly
present
to
my
mind
of
diminishing
our
taxes
sir
in
the
remarks
submitted
by
me
on
a
former
occasion
i
ventured
to
say
that
the
first
great
duty
of
congress
was
to
mitigate
the
burdens
now
pressing
upon
the
energies
of
the
people
and
upon
the
business
of
the
country
and
as
one
means
of
accomplishing
this
important
result
to
extend
these
burdens
in
a
diminishing
annual
ratio
over
a
large
population
entering
upon
the
enjoyment
of
the
blessings
which
the
present
generation
at
such
enormous
cost
has
assured
to
the
republic
upon
the
assumption
that
the
national
revenues
and
the
national
expenditures
would
continue
relatively
the
same
as
now
a
sum
extending
from
eighty
to
one
hundred
millions
would
be
the
measure
of
relief
that
might
be
accorded
at
once
without
arresting
the
continuous
reduction
of
the
debt
at
the
rate
of
a
month
in
proposing
this
large
reduction
of
taxation
at
this
time
with
the
hope
of
larger
reductions
in
the
near
future
it
was
necessary
to
keep
in
view
the
possibility
of
increased
expenditure
or
of
decreased
receipts
to
guard
against
such
contingency
we
must
keep
strict
watch
over
the
expenditures
and
if
possible
diminish
the
positive
annual
obligations
of
the
nation
and
here
the
mind
is
naturally
and
irresistibly
attracted
to
the
prodigious
item
of
interest
can
not
this
be
reduced
at
an
early
day
by
a
large
amount
and
then
subsequently
though
contingently
by
a
much
larger
amount
and
should
not
this
result
be
one
of
our
first
endeavors
is
it
not
the
first
considerable
stage
in
the
reduction
of
taxation
the
credit
of
the
country
is
injured
by
two
causes
first
the
refusal
to
redeem
obligations
being
so
much
which
condition
must
necessarily
continue
so
long
as
we
deliberately
sanction
an
inconvertible
currency
and
secondly
the
menace
of
repudiation
with
slurs
upon
the
integrity
of
the
people
uttered
in
important
quarters
these
two
causes
are
impediments
to
the
national
credit
how
long
shall
they
continue
loyally
and
emphatically
has
congress
declared
that
all
the
obligations
of
the
nation
shall
be
paid
according
to
their
spirit
as
well
as
letter
but
this
is
not
enough
more
must
be
done
and
here
congress
must
act
not
partially
nor
timidly
nor
in
the
interests
of
the
few
only
but
impartially
comprehensively
firmly
and
in
the
interests
of
the
many
it
must
help
the
recognized
ability
of
the
nation
by
removing
its
disabilities
nearly
five
years
have
now
passed
since
the
rebellion
sheathed
its
sword
but
the
national
expenditures
did
not
cease
at
once
when
the
sword
no
longer
plied
its
bloody
work
they
still
continued
sometimes
under
existing
contracts
which
could
not
be
broken
sometimes
in
guarding
the
transition
from
war
to
peace
meanwhile
the
national
faith
was
preserved
while
the
people
carried
the
unexampled
burden
willingly
if
not
cheerfully
the
large
unliquidated
debt
the
of
the
war
has
been
paid
off
or
reduced
to
a
form
satisfactory
to
the
creditor
and
the
world
has
been
assured
that
the
people
are
ready
for
any
sacrifices
according
to
the
exigency
is
more
necessary
should
these
sacrifices
be
continued
when
the
exigency
has
ceased
these
sacrifices
are
twofold
being
direct
and
indirect
the
direct
are
measured
by
the
known
amount
of
taxation
the
indirect
are
also
traced
to
existing
taxation
and
their
witnesses
are
crippled
trade
unsettled
values
oppressive
prices
and
an
inconvertible
currency
which
of
itself
is
a
constant
sacrifice
therefore
do
i
say
again
with
the
taxes
bills
relating
to
taxation
do
not
originate
in
the
senate
but
senators
are
not
shut
out
from
expressing
themselves
freely
on
the
proper
policy
which
is
demanded
at
this
time
on
the
finances
and
the
banks
the
senate
has
the
same
powers
as
the
other
house
here
it
may
take
the
initiative
as
is
shown
by
the
present
bill
but
what
it
does
should
be
equal
to
the
occasion
it
should
be
large
and
not
petty
and
not
restricted
in
its
sphere
the
present
bill
i
fear
has
none
of
these
qualities
which
we
desire
at
this
time
it
is
a
patch
or
plaster
only
when
we
need
a
comprehensive
cure
to
my
mind
it
is
easy
to
see
what
must
be
done
the
country
must
be
relieved
from
its
heavy
burdens
taxation
must
be
made
lighter
also
less
complex
and
inquisitorial
simplification
will
be
a
form
of
relief
our
banking
system
is
ready
to
adapt
itself
to
the
wants
of
the
country
if
you
will
only
say
the
word
speak
sir
and
it
will
do
what
you
desire
but
instead
of
this
we
are
asked
by
the
committee
to
begin
by
making
the
system
more
complex
without
adding
to
its
efficiency
we
are
asked
to
construct
a
third
currency
which
so
long
as
it
continues
must
be
a
we
are
asked
to
establish
discord
instead
of
concord
now
sir
in
order
to
bring
the
senate
to
a
precise
vote
on
what
i
regard
as
the
fundamental
proposition
of
my
amendment
i
shall
withdraw
the
amendment
as
a
whole
and
move
to
strike
out
the
first
two
sections
of
the
bill
and
to
insert
as
a
substitute
what
i
send
to
the
chair
the
proposed
substitute
being
section
of
bill
having
been
read
he
continued
on
that
proposition
i
have
one
word
to
say
it
is
brief
that
you
will
admit
it
is
simple
that
you
will
admit
it
enlarges
the
existing
national
bank
circulation
by
that
is
ample
as
i
believe
you
will
admit
practically
it
is
a
system
of
free
banking
that
is
it
is
such
until
the
enlarged
circulation
is
absorbed
that
is
for
some
time
to
come
but
free
banking
is
what
as
i
understand
senators
desire
then
again
it
has
in
it
no
element
of
injustice
there
is
no
injustice
to
the
north
or
to
the
east
all
parts
of
the
country
are
equally
accommodated
and
equally
protected
but
this
can
not
be
said
of
the
pending
measure
then
again
it
is
elastic
adapting
itself
everywhere
to
the
exigencies
of
the
place
if
banking
facilities
are
needed
and
the
capital
is
ready
under
that
amendment
they
can
be
enjoyed
unlike
the
proposition
of
the
committee
it
is
not
of
but
is
so
as
to
adapt
itself
to
all
the
conditions
of
business
in
every
part
of
the
country
then
again
in
the
final
provision
that
for
every
issued
a
greenback
shall
be
withdrawn
you
find
the
great
highway
to
specie
payments
all
your
greenbacks
will
speedily
be
withdrawn
you
will
have
then
only
the
making
one
paper
currency
and
then
speedily
within
a
brief
period
you
will
have
specie
payments
the
banks
must
have
their
reserves
there
will
be
no
greenbacks
for
them
they
must
find
them
in
specie
the
banks
then
and
every
stockholder
will
find
a
motive
to
press
for
specie
payments
and
you
will
have
that
great
result
quietly
accomplished
absolutely
without
shock
while
the
business
interests
of
the
country
will
rejoice
february
in
further
advocacy
of
this
amendment
sumner
said
president
as
it
is
understood
that
the
senate
is
to
vote
on
the
bill
and
all
pending
propositions
i
seize
this
moment
to
say
a
last
word
for
the
proposition
which
i
have
had
the
honor
of
moving
and
which
is
now
pending
but
before
i
proceed
with
the
discussion
allow
me
to
say
that
while
sitting
at
my
desk
here
i
have
received
expressions
of
opinion
from
different
parts
of
the
country
one
or
two
of
which
i
will
read
for
instance
here
is
a
telegraphic
dispatch
from
a
leading
financial
gentleman
in
chicago
views
on
currency
question
much
approved
here
authorize
new
bank
circulation
to
extent
named
retiring
greenbacks
this
is
the
very
rule
which
i
seek
to
establish
at
the
same
time
i
received
a
communication
from
circleville
ohio
dated
january
the
first
sentences
of
which
i
will
read
pardon
me
for
this
intrusion
i
desire
to
ask
if
you
are
willing
to
indicate
what
will
likely
be
the
result
of
your
financial
bill
i
think
i
only
utter
the
sentiment
of
three
fourths
of
all
the
commercial
men
through
our
great
and
growing
west
when
i
say
it
should
become
a
law
and
thereby
secure
to
us
our
equal
share
of
the
national
banking
capital
which
we
now
need
so
this
again
is
what
i
seek
to
accomplish
at
this
stage
i
hope
i
may
have
the
indulgence
of
the
senate
if
i
ask
one
attention
to
the
bill
of
the
committee
on
a
former
occasion
i
ventured
to
say
that
it
was
inadequate
the
more
i
reflect
upon
it
the
longer
this
debate
is
continued
the
more
i
am
impressed
with
its
inadequacy
it
does
not
do
what
should
be
done
by
the
first
measure
of
legislation
on
our
finances
adopted
by
the
present
congress
it
is
incomplete
i
wish
i
could
stop
there
but
i
am
obliged
to
go
further
and
say
that
it
is
not
only
incomplete
but
it
is
in
certainly
one
of
its
features
to
which
i
shall
call
attention
mischievous
i
take
advantage
of
this
moment
to
present
this
point
because
it
has
not
been
mentioned
before
and
because
at
a
later
stage
i
may
not
have
the
opportunity
of
doing
so
it
is
this
provision
at
the
end
of
the
first
section
a
new
apportionment
shall
be
made
as
soon
as
practicable
based
upon
the
census
of
at
the
proper
time
i
shall
move
to
strike
out
these
words
and
i
will
now
very
briefly
assign
my
reasons
the
proposition
is
objectionable
first
because
it
is
mischievous
and
secondly
because
it
is
difficult
if
not
impracticable
in
its
operation
and
if
i
can
have
the
attention
of
the
senate
unless
figures
deceive
me
and
unless
facts
are
at
fault
i
think
that
the
senate
must
agree
in
my
conclusion
we
are
told
by
the
comptroller
of
the
currency
that
is
a
large
allowance
of
currency
at
this
moment
for
the
south
and
west
indeed
i
believe
he
puts
the
limit
at
now
suppose
only
are
taken
up
during
the
coming
year
that
is
till
the
completion
of
the
census
that
would
leave
still
outstanding
which
might
be
employed
for
the
benefit
of
the
south
and
west
that
circumstance
indicates
to
a
certain
extent
the
financial
condition
of
those
parts
of
the
country
do
they
need
larger
facilities
and
if
so
to
what
extent
can
you
determine
in
advance
i
doubt
it
but
sir
in
the
face
of
this
uncertainty
this
bill
steps
in
and
declares
positively
that
new
apportionment
shall
be
made
as
soon
as
practicable
based
upon
the
census
of
what
will
be
the
effect
of
such
a
new
apportionment
even
according
to
the
census
of
such
new
apportionment
would
transfer
some
sixty
million
dollars
from
banks
that
enjoy
it
to
other
parts
of
the
country
it
would
take
away
from
those
banks
what
they
want
and
transfer
it
where
it
is
not
wanted
the
language
is
imperative
but
sir
it
is
not
to
be
under
the
census
of
but
under
the
census
of
and
unless
figures
deceive
by
that
census
the
empire
of
the
great
west
will
be
more
than
ever
manifest
and
if
the
transfer
is
made
accordingly
it
will
take
some
ninety
or
one
hundred
million
dollars
from
where
it
now
is
and
is
needed
and
carry
it
to
other
places
where
certainly
it
will
not
be
needed
in
the
same
degree
what
will
be
the
effect
of
such
a
transfer
mark
sir
the
statute
is
mandatory
and
unconditional
there
is
no
chance
for
discretion
it
is
to
be
done
the
transfer
is
to
be
made
and
now
what
must
be
the
consequence
a
derangement
of
business
which
it
is
difficult
to
imagine
a
contraction
of
currency
instantaneous
and
spasmodic
to
the
amount
of
these
large
sums
that
i
have
indicated
i
do
not
shrink
from
contraction
i
am
ready
to
say
to
the
people
of
massachusetts
the
senate
will
adopt
any
policy
of
contraction
that
is
healthy
and
with
proper
conditions
i
would
recommend
its
but
a
contraction
like
that
proposed
by
this
bill
which
arbitrarily
takes
from
north
and
east
this
vast
amount
and
transfers
it
to
another
part
of
the
country
where
it
may
not
be
needed
such
a
contraction
i
oppose
as
mischievous
i
see
no
good
in
it
i
see
a
disturbance
of
all
the
channels
of
business
and
i
see
a
contraction
which
must
be
itself
infinitely
detrimental
to
the
financial
interests
of
the
republic
but
then
sir
have
you
considered
whether
you
can
do
it
is
it
practicable
i
have
shown
that
it
is
mischievous
is
it
practicable
can
you
take
this
large
amount
of
currency
from
one
part
of
the
country
and
transfer
it
to
another
have
you
ever
reflected
upon
the
history
of
the
after
it
has
commenced
its
travels
when
it
has
once
left
the
maternal
bank
it
goes
you
know
not
where
i
have
been
informed
by
and
by
those
most
familiar
with
such
things
that
a
when
once
issued
very
rarely
returns
home
i
have
been
assured
that
it
is
hardly
ever
seen
again
the
banks
indeed
may
go
into
liquidation
but
their
notes
are
still
current
the
maternal
bank
may
be
mouldering
in
the
earth
but
these
its
children
are
moving
about
performing
the
work
of
circulation
why
the
credit
of
the
nation
is
behind
them
and
everybody
knows
when
he
takes
one
of
them
that
he
is
safe
therefore
i
ask
how
can
the
proposed
requirement
be
carried
into
execution
how
can
you
bring
back
these
runaways
when
once
in
circulation
on
their
perpetual
travels
there
is
but
one
way
and
that
is
by
the
return
to
specie
payments
hold
up
before
them
coin
and
they
will
all
come
running
back
to
the
original
bank
but
until
then
they
will
continue
abroad
the
proposed
requirement
seems
to
go
on
the
idea
that
like
cows
return
from
pasture
at
night
whereas
we
all
know
that
until
specie
payments
they
are
more
like
the
wild
cattle
of
the
prairies
and
the
pampas
you
can
not
find
them
they
are
everywhere
surely
i
am
not
wrong
when
i
suggest
that
the
proposed
requirement
is
impracticable
as
well
as
mischievous
and
at
the
proper
time
i
shall
move
to
strike
it
out
the
amendment
which
i
have
moved
has
been
under
discussion
for
several
days
it
has
had
the
valuable
support
of
the
senator
from
michigan
chandler
who
brings
to
financial
questions
practical
experience
it
has
been
opposed
by
other
senators
and
with
considerable
ardor
by
my
excellent
friend
from
indiana
morton
on
thursday
last
the
senator
from
indiana
addressing
himself
to
me
and
inviting
a
reply
which
i
was
then
prevented
from
making
took
issue
with
me
directly
upon
the
position
i
have
assumed
that
the
withdrawal
of
notes
would
materially
assist
the
effort
for
specie
payments
and
he
further
declared
that
the
two
currencies
of
and
united
states
notes
were
kept
together
because
one
was
redeemable
with
the
other
i
do
not
quote
his
precise
words
but
i
give
the
substance
under
the
policy
we
are
now
pursuing
it
seems
to
me
that
with
of
notes
in
circulation
the
government
will
not
for
many
years
if
ever
again
pay
specie
with
that
amount
of
united
states
notes
under
the
actual
policy
the
bank
currency
will
forever
remain
inconvertible
and
the
correctness
of
these
positions
i
will
endeavor
briefly
to
demonstrate
a
convertible
currency
is
nothing
more
nor
less
than
the
servant
of
coin
if
there
is
no
coin
it
can
neither
be
servant
nor
representative
though
it
may
attempt
to
perform
the
functions
of
coin
presenting
itself
under
false
pretences
it
but
partially
succeeds
in
this
attempt
and
the
discredit
attaching
to
it
compels
it
to
pay
more
for
any
property
than
would
be
the
price
of
such
property
in
coin
or
the
acknowledged
representative
of
coin
just
as
doubtful
people
must
submit
to
ten
fifteen
or
twenty
per
cent
discount
when
what
is
known
as
commercial
paper
is
discounted
at
five
six
or
seven
per
cent
thus
far
we
have
had
no
coin
in
the
treasury
appropriated
to
the
stability
of
the
united
states
notes
and
under
our
present
policy
dictated
by
the
restrictive
laws
that
hedge
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
and
confine
his
liberty
of
action
we
never
shall
have
until
the
whole
bonded
debt
of
the
country
is
extinguished
while
at
the
same
time
the
banks
are
excused
under
the
law
from
all
attempts
to
fortify
their
notes
with
coin
and
what
is
it
that
successfully
discourages
us
from
direct
steps
toward
specie
payments
in
the
first
place
it
is
the
mistrust
of
the
people
in
our
ability
to
resume
and
to
maintain
resumption
in
the
next
place
the
monthly
publication
of
the
treasury
discloses
precisely
our
weakness
as
well
as
our
strength
and
the
great
element
of
our
weakness
is
the
volume
of
our
and
demand
obligations
in
ordinary
times
that
is
when
the
people
have
confidence
in
the
ability
of
the
banks
to
redeem
their
demand
obligations
in
coin
a
reserve
of
twenty
to
per
cent
in
coin
is
more
than
sufficient
to
meet
any
probable
demand
that
may
be
made
let
mistrust
arise
in
relation
to
the
solvency
of
any
bank
or
of
the
system
of
banks
and
the
reserve
of
per
cent
will
vanish
as
the
dew
before
the
sun
and
the
individual
bank
or
all
the
banks
must
close
their
doors
to
all
demands
for
specie
in
our
present
legislation
we
encounter
this
mistrust
among
the
people
and
so
long
as
we
ourselves
exhibit
so
great
timidity
in
our
attempts
at
legislation
upon
this
subject
just
so
long
do
we
minister
to
and
strengthen
this
mistrust
the
amount
of
demand
obligations
which
the
treasury
must
be
prepared
to
meet
upon
a
notice
including
three
per
cent
certificates
and
fractional
currency
is
more
than
four
hundred
and
forty
million
dollars
with
the
existing
mistrust
measured
by
the
premium
on
gold
a
reserve
of
per
cent
of
coin
in
the
treasury
appropriated
to
these
demands
would
be
totally
insufficient
this
reserve
must
bear
a
proportion
to
the
aggregate
of
liabilities
so
large
as
to
remove
mistrust
and
this
can
be
accomplished
only
by
presenting
as
in
the
vaults
of
the
treasury
an
amount
of
coin
nearly
equal
to
the
sum
of
liabilities
if
during
the
last
three
years
we
had
retained
the
surplus
of
coin
that
has
reached
the
treasury
we
should
now
have
enough
but
as
a
consequence
of
such
accumulation
speculation
would
have
run
riot
and
i
fear
if
we
should
now
by
legislative
enactment
decree
that
course
for
the
future
we
should
aggravate
the
situation
what
then
is
left
for
us
to
do
what
but
to
lessen
our
liabilities
which
as
the
laws
now
stand
must
remain
the
same
as
and
one
two
or
five
years
hence
immutably
as
now
difficulties
beset
the
contraction
of
those
liabilities
as
there
are
difficulties
that
impede
the
accumulation
of
coin
in
sufficient
amount
to
meet
our
purpose
but
the
former
may
be
neutralized
if
not
removed
by
judicious
compensations
that
will
not
in
any
serious
degree
retard
the
object
for
which
i
would
legislate
sound
financial
authorities
unite
in
declaring
that
if
the
government
resumes
specie
payments
the
banks
of
new
york
can
resume
and
when
the
banks
of
new
york
resume
the
whole
country
can
resume
evidently
then
our
care
is
the
government
and
what
is
the
first
step
to
my
mind
we
must
lessen
the
demand
obligations
of
the
government
while
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
at
the
same
time
strengthens
the
reserves
in
the
national
vaults
neither
should
be
done
suddenly
or
violently
but
gradually
judiciously
and
wisely
as
the
statutes
now
stand
the
obligations
can
not
be
reduced
with
the
present
volume
of
obligations
the
laws
of
trade
prevent
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
from
sufficiently
strengthening
his
reserves
it
therefore
devolves
upon
the
national
legislature
to
take
the
initiative
in
the
effort
to
resume
specie
payments
the
difficulties
that
impede
the
reduction
of
the
national
liabilities
lie
in
the
fact
that
such
obligations
are
a
part
and
a
large
part
of
the
currency
of
the
country
to
withdraw
that
currency
without
giving
a
substitute
is
to
create
stringency
burden
trade
and
invite
chaos
at
least
so
it
seems
these
obligations
so
far
as
they
relate
to
the
currency
are
larger
in
amount
than
those
of
the
national
banks
combined
and
furthermore
they
are
the
head
and
front
of
all
they
are
so
large
as
to
be
beyond
the
point
of
manageability
and
i
would
therefore
reduce
them
within
control
it
is
their
volume
that
puts
them
beyond
control
and
it
is
our
want
of
control
that
causes
them
to
be
depreciated
thus
sir
i
would
offer
inducements
to
fund
them
or
part
of
them
in
bonds
that
would
be
sought
after
because
of
their
valuable
uses
beyond
a
mere
investment
and
to
neutralize
the
evils
of
contraction
of
treasury
liabilities
by
authorizing
their
assumption
with
the
consent
of
the
people
by
various
parties
in
different
sections
of
the
country
each
one
of
whom
would
be
fully
equal
to
the
task
thus
voluntarily
assumed
i
would
issue
a
for
every
dollar
of
treasury
obligation
cancelled
but
i
would
issue
no
that
did
not
absorb
an
equal
obligation
of
the
treasury
by
this
distribution
of
a
portion
of
the
demand
obligations
you
restore
to
the
government
the
full
ability
to
meet
the
remainder
and
at
the
same
time
the
people
know
that
so
far
as
the
currency
goes
and
it
is
of
this
only
we
are
treating
every
promise
of
any
bank
has
its
ultimate
recourse
in
the
treasury
of
the
united
states
the
absorption
of
one
hundred
and
fifty
or
two
hundred
millions
can
not
fail
to
enhance
the
remaining
nearly
if
not
quite
to
par
with
gold
the
volume
of
currency
in
the
channels
of
trade
and
in
the
hands
of
the
people
will
be
about
the
same
as
now
the
aggregate
of
united
states
notes
and
national
outstanding
will
be
precisely
the
same
therefore
the
indirect
contraction
so
much
dwelt
upon
will
scarcely
be
felt
the
volume
of
greenbacks
will
be
ample
for
the
reserves
of
the
banks
and
their
growing
scarcity
will
cause
them
to
become
more
and
more
valuable
and
as
they
approach
the
standard
of
gold
so
will
they
sustain
with
golden
support
the
into
which
they
are
convertible
the
demand
by
the
people
for
will
not
be
appreciably
increased
as
the
is
receivable
by
the
government
for
all
dues
except
customs
and
those
demands
are
necessarily
localized
while
the
growing
scarcity
of
greenbacks
because
of
their
replacement
by
fulfilling
all
the
requirements
of
general
trade
will
not
be
noticed
by
the
people
the
banks
will
take
heed
lest
they
fall
and
at
an
early
day
begin
to
strengthen
themselves
reserves
they
must
have
and
with
the
honest
eyes
of
our
secretary
of
the
treasury
to
detect
any
deficiency
they
will
begin
their
strengthening
policy
at
once
instead
of
putting
gold
received
as
interest
forthwith
on
the
market
for
sale
they
will
put
it
snugly
away
in
their
vaults
the
gold
which
comes
to
them
in
the
course
of
banking
operations
will
be
added
thereto
and
almost
imperceptibly
the
country
banks
will
arrive
at
the
condition
of
the
city
banks
whose
reserves
in
coin
and
notes
are
now
far
beyond
the
requirements
of
law
in
the
mean
time
and
without
derangement
of
business
the
treasury
may
strengthen
its
reserve
while
on
the
other
hand
the
quiet
reduction
of
its
liabilities
advances
the
percentage
of
the
reserve
to
the
whole
amount
of
liabilities
in
almost
a
compound
ratio
with
this
strengthening
of
the
condition
of
the
treasury
made
manifest
to
all
the
world
by
its
monthly
publications
the
mistrust
of
the
people
will
be
gradually
but
surely
dissipated
and
as
surely
be
replaced
by
confidence
that
all
demand
obligations
will
be
redeemed
at
an
early
day
a
confidence
as
and
as
is
that
now
prevailing
in
relation
to
our
bonded
debt
that
it
will
be
paid
according
to
the
spirit
as
well
as
the
letter
of
the
law
it
will
thus
be
seen
that
just
in
proportion
to
the
strengthening
of
the
do
we
strengthen
the
strike
out
of
existence
in
a
single
day
the
notes
and
i
fear
that
the
would
for
a
time
fall
in
comparative
value
so
would
everything
else
but
i
advocate
no
such
violent
measure
the
senator
from
indiana
in
his
remarks
appeared
to
forget
that
we
have
in
the
country
two
or
three
hundred
millions
of
another
being
coin
now
displaced
of
which
no
legitimate
use
is
made
in
connection
with
the
currency
that
should
resume
its
proper
position
in
the
paper
circulation
of
the
country
here
are
two
or
three
hundred
millions
of
money
now
by
force
of
law
demonetized
which
i
would
have
relieved
of
its
disabilities
i
would
change
the
relation
of
master
it
now
occupies
to
that
of
servant
where
it
properly
belongs
and
i
would
inflate
the
currency
with
it
to
the
extent
that
we
possess
it
inflation
by
coin
is
simply
specie
payment
or
very
near
it
i
have
endeavored
president
thus
briefly
to
respond
to
the
questions
propounded
to
me
i
do
not
know
that
i
have
entered
sufficiently
into
detail
to
explain
clearly
my
convictions
as
to
the
necessity
for
reducing
the
volume
of
obligations
and
to
prove
as
i
desire
to
prove
that
their
gradual
withdrawal
will
enhance
not
only
the
value
of
the
remainder
but
also
the
value
of
the
both
will
ascend
in
the
scale
this
enhancement
of
the
whole
paper
currency
will
tend
to
draw
the
coin
of
the
country
from
its
seclusion
as
in
the
early
period
of
the
war
before
the
present
currency
was
created
we
were
astonished
at
the
positive
but
hidden
money
resources
of
the
people
so
will
the
outflow
of
hidden
coin
confound
the
calculations
of
those
who
suppose
that
its
volume
is
to
be
measured
by
the
amount
in
the
treasury
and
in
the
new
york
banks
president
i
am
not
alone
in
asking
for
the
reformation
of
our
currency
as
the
first
stage
of
our
financial
efforts
i
read
from
the
and
financial
of
new
york
an
authoritative
paper
on
this
subject
as
follows
any
practical
scheme
to
improve
the
government
finances
and
credit
or
to
restore
prosperous
activities
or
both
at
once
the
first
thing
to
be
done
the
restoration
of
a
sound
currency
that
done
or
provided
for
all
the
rest
will
be
easy
the
best
credit
and
the
lowest
rates
of
interest
will
to
this
end
our
greenbacks
must
be
absorbed
or
paid
and
my
proposition
provides
a
way
as
the
greenbacks
are
withdrawn
coin
will
reappear
to
take
their
place
in
the
banks
and
the
business
of
the
country
this
will
be
specie
payments
here
i
wish
to
remark
that
i
fail
to
see
the
asserted
dependence
of
our
demand
notes
on
our
bonds
the
bonds
may
be
at
par
without
bringing
the
notes
to
par
and
so
the
notes
may
be
at
par
without
bringing
the
bonds
to
par
according
to
the
experience
of
other
countries
bonds
and
notes
do
not
materially
affect
each
other
the
two
travel
on
parallel
lines
without
touching
each
must
be
provided
for
and
my
present
purpose
is
to
provide
for
the
demand
notes
there
is
strong
reason
why
this
is
the
very
moment
for
this
effort
according
to
statistical
tables
now
before
me
our
exports
are
tending
to
an
equality
with
our
imports
during
the
five
months
of
july
august
september
october
and
november
there
has
been
a
nominal
balance
in
our
favor
of
whereas
during
the
same
months
of
last
year
there
was
an
adverse
balance
of
the
movement
of
specie
is
equally
advantageous
during
the
five
months
above
mentioned
there
has
been
an
import
in
specie
of
against
during
the
same
months
last
year
and
an
export
in
specie
of
against
during
the
same
months
last
year
according
to
these
indubitable
figures
the
tide
of
specie
as
well
as
of
business
is
beginning
to
turn
it
remains
for
us
by
wise
legislation
to
take
advantage
of
the
propitious
moment
take
the
proper
steps
and
you
will
have
specie
payments
having
which
all
the
rest
will
follow
because
i
desire
to
secure
this
great
boon
for
my
country
i
now
make
this
effort
the
amendment
was
rejected
march
bill
having
been
reported
back
from
the
committee
on
finance
with
an
amendment
in
the
nature
of
a
substitute
he
spoke
in
review
of
their
respective
provisions
as
follows
president
the
measure
now
before
the
senate
concerns
interests
vast
in
amount
and
influence
i
doubt
if
ever
before
any
nation
has
attempted
to
deal
at
once
with
so
large
a
mass
of
financial
obligations
being
nothing
less
than
the
whole
national
debt
of
the
united
states
but
beyond
the
proper
disposition
of
this
mass
is
the
question
of
taxation
and
also
of
the
extent
to
which
the
payment
of
the
national
debt
shall
be
assumed
by
the
present
generation
and
beyond
all
is
the
question
of
specie
payments
on
all
these
heads
my
own
conclusions
are
fixed
the
mass
of
financial
obligations
should
be
promptly
adjusted
in
some
new
form
at
smaller
interest
taxes
must
be
reduced
the
payment
of
the
national
debt
must
be
left
in
part
to
posterity
specie
payments
must
be
provided
for
the
immediate
question
before
the
senate
is
on
a
substitute
reported
by
the
committee
for
the
bill
which
i
had
the
honor
of
introducing
some
weeks
ago
considering
my
connection
with
this
measure
i
hope
that
i
shall
not
intrude
too
much
if
i
recur
to
the
original
bill
and
explain
its
provisions
there
are
certain
general
objects
which
must
not
be
forgotten
in
our
present
endeavor
i
have
already
said
that
the
taxes
must
be
reduced
here
i
am
happy
to
observe
that
the
popular
branch
of
congress
in
the
exercise
of
its
constitutional
prerogative
has
taken
the
initiative
and
is
perfecting
measures
to
this
end
i
trust
that
they
will
proceed
prudently
but
boldly
in
harmony
with
this
effort
the
expenditures
of
the
government
should
be
revised
and
cut
down
to
the
lowest
point
consistent
with
efficiency
economy
will
be
an
important
ally
even
in
small
affairs
it
will
be
the
witness
to
our
purposes
through
these
agencies
our
currency
will
be
improved
and
we
shall
be
brought
to
specie
payments
while
the
national
credit
will
be
established
not
at
once
can
all
this
be
accomplished
but
i
am
sure
that
we
may
now
do
much
as
often
as
i
return
to
this
subject
i
am
impressed
by
the
damage
the
country
has
already
suffered
through
menacing
propositions
affecting
the
national
credit
i
can
not
doubt
that
in
this
way
the
national
burdens
have
been
sensibly
increased
by
in
the
name
of
congress
we
have
attempted
to
counteract
these
injurious
influences
we
have
met
words
with
words
but
this
is
not
enough
there
is
another
remark
which
i
wish
to
make
although
i
do
little
more
than
repeat
what
i
said
on
another
occasion
it
is
that
a
national
debt
when
once
funded
does
not
seem
to
affect
largely
the
condition
of
the
currency
the
value
of
the
former
is
maintained
or
depressed
by
circumstances
independent
of
the
currency
but
on
the
other
hand
the
condition
of
the
currency
bears
directly
upon
all
efforts
for
increased
loans
and
this
is
of
practical
importance
on
the
present
occasion
the
rules
of
business
are
the
same
for
the
nation
as
for
an
individual
nor
can
a
nation
when
it
becomes
a
borrower
hope
to
escape
the
scrutiny
which
is
applied
to
an
individual
under
similar
circumstances
applying
this
scrutiny
to
our
case
it
appears
that
on
our
existing
bonded
debt
we
have
thus
far
performed
all
existing
obligations
not
without
discussion
i
regret
to
add
that
has
left
in
some
quarters
a
lingering
doubt
with
regard
to
the
future
and
not
without
an
opposition
still
alive
if
not
formidable
but
the
case
is
worse
with
regard
to
that
other
branch
of
the
national
debt
known
as
where
we
daily
fail
to
perform
existing
obligations
so
that
these
notes
are
nothing
more
than
so
much
with
regard
to
this
branch
of
the
national
debt
there
is
an
open
confession
of
insolvency
and
each
day
renews
the
confession
now
by
the
immutable
laws
of
credit
which
all
legislative
enactments
are
impotent
to
counteract
or
expunge
the
nation
must
suffer
when
it
enters
the
market
as
a
borrower
failing
to
pay
these
obligations
already
due
it
must
pay
more
for
what
it
borrows
nor
can
we
hope
for
more
than
partial
success
until
this
dishonor
is
removed
with
these
preliminary
remarks
which
are
rather
hints
than
arguments
i
come
directly
to
the
measure
before
the
senate
and
here
i
begin
with
the
first
section
i
wish
the
senate
would
note
the
difference
between
this
section
in
my
bill
and
in
the
substitute
of
the
committee
i
proposed
to
authorize
the
issue
of
of
five
per
and
prescribe
the
use
to
which
the
proceeds
of
such
bonds
should
be
applied
the
committee
propose
of
five
per
and
leave
the
application
of
the
proceeds
the
subject
of
discretion
between
the
two
propositions
there
are
several
differences
first
in
the
amount
secondly
in
the
length
of
the
bond
and
thirdly
in
the
application
of
the
proceeds
here
i
beg
to
observe
that
the
original
sum
of
was
not
inserted
by
accident
or
because
it
was
a
round
and
euphonious
sum
nothing
of
the
kind
it
was
the
result
of
a
careful
examination
of
the
national
debt
in
its
details
especially
in
the
light
of
the
national
credit
it
was
adopted
because
it
was
the
very
sum
required
by
the
nature
of
the
case
at
least
so
it
seemed
to
me
a
brief
explanation
will
show
if
i
was
not
right
the
year
which
marks
the
date
of
our
marks
also
the
date
of
a
new
system
in
regard
to
our
loans
senators
are
hardly
aware
of
this
change
previously
our
standard
for
sixes
was
an
immutable
loan
for
twenty
years
by
the
new
system
this
immutability
was
continued
as
to
the
right
of
demand
by
the
bondholder
but
the
right
of
payment
was
reserved
to
the
nation
at
any
time
after
five
years
this
change
as
we
now
see
gave
positive
advantages
to
the
nation
its
disadvantages
to
the
bondholder
were
so
apparent
that
it
encountered
resistance
which
was
overcome
only
after
undaunted
perseverance
and
final
appeal
to
the
people
now
by
recurring
to
the
schedule
of
the
national
debt
you
will
find
that
the
first
loan
within
the
sphere
of
this
discretionary
system
is
the
of
which
on
the
of
february
last
after
deducting
the
purchased
bonds
were
this
therefore
is
the
first
loan
falling
within
our
discretion
the
first
loan
we
are
privileged
to
pay
before
maturity
and
the
first
loan
presenting
itself
for
payment
in
these
incidents
the
loan
of
has
precedence
it
stands
first
but
there
is
a
reason
which
to
my
mind
is
of
peculiar
force
why
this
first
loan
should
be
paid
in
coin
at
the
earliest
possible
day
it
seems
to
me
that
i
do
not
deceive
myself
when
i
consider
it
conclusive
on
this
question
the
loan
of
is
the
specific
loan
which
has
been
made
the
objective
point
of
all
the
movements
under
the
banner
of
repudiation
it
is
the
loan
to
which
this
idea
first
attached
itself
it
is
the
loan
first
menaced
therefore
to
my
mind
it
is
the
loan
which
should
be
first
provided
for
i
know
no
way
short
of
universal
specie
payments
by
which
the
national
credit
can
be
so
effectually
advanced
why
in
the
amendment
of
the
committee
the
amount
of
the
proposed
issue
is
placed
at
i
am
at
a
loss
to
conceive
here
is
no
equivalent
of
any
one
loan
nor
of
two
or
more
loans
it
is
an
accidental
sum
and
might
have
been
more
or
less
for
the
same
reason
that
it
is
what
it
is
the
term
seems
also
accidental
as
it
is
unquestionably
new
of
course
it
is
assumed
that
the
amount
proposed
of
at
five
per
cent
will
absorb
an
equal
amount
of
at
six
per
irrespective
of
any
particular
loan
but
i
am
at
a
loss
to
see
on
what
grounds
the
holders
of
the
sixes
can
be
induced
to
make
the
exchange
will
the
substitute
bonds
be
considered
of
equal
value
i
affirm
not
but
assuming
that
they
are
acceptable
how
shall
they
be
acceptably
distributed
shall
the
first
comer
be
first
served
if
all
were
at
the
same
the
palm
might
be
justly
bestowed
upon
the
most
swift
in
the
latitude
allowed
stretching
over
all
the
there
would
be
opportunity
for
favoritism
and
with
this
opportunity
there
would
be
temptation
and
suspicion
the
change
from
a
bond
to
a
bond
as
proposed
by
the
committee
is
a
change
so
far
as
i
can
perceive
made
up
of
disadvantages
to
the
nation
there
is
the
same
rate
of
interest
and
there
is
the
same
fixed
period
during
which
this
interest
must
be
paid
while
on
the
other
hand
the
period
of
optional
payment
is
reduced
from
thirty
years
to
ten
years
if
there
be
advantage
in
this
reduction
i
do
not
perceive
it
if
at
the
expiration
of
ten
years
we
are
in
a
condition
to
pay
we
may
do
so
as
readily
under
a
as
under
the
proposed
if
during
the
subsequent
ten
years
of
option
our
advancing
credit
enables
us
to
command
a
lower
rate
of
interest
surely
we
may
do
so
just
as
favorably
under
one
as
under
the
other
there
is
no
benefit
within
the
bounds
of
imagination
so
far
at
least
as
i
can
discern
which
will
not
redound
to
the
nation
from
as
much
as
from
on
the
other
hand
it
is
within
possibilities
from
disturbance
in
the
money
markets
of
the
world
or
from
other
unforeseen
circumstances
that
it
may
not
be
convenient
during
the
short
optional
period
of
the
committee
to
obtain
the
necessary
coin
without
a
sacrifice
the
greater
latitude
of
payment
leaves
the
nation
master
of
the
situation
to
pay
or
not
to
pay
as
is
most
for
the
national
advantage
furthermore
the
loan
proposed
by
the
committee
has
not
to
my
mind
the
elements
of
success
promised
by
the
other
loan
it
is
assumed
in
both
cases
that
the
coin
for
the
redemption
of
the
existing
obligations
shall
be
obtained
in
europe
then
we
must
look
to
the
european
market
in
determining
the
form
of
the
new
loan
now
i
have
reason
to
believe
that
a
coin
loan
to
the
amount
of
may
be
obtained
in
europe
on
at
par
provided
the
new
bonds
are
of
the
same
form
and
purport
as
the
which
are
already
so
popular
and
provided
further
that
the
proceeds
of
the
loan
are
applied
to
the
payment
in
coin
at
par
of
the
of
the
reasons
are
obvious
the
have
a
good
name
which
is
much
to
start
with
it
is
like
the
credit
or
of
an
established
mercantile
house
which
stands
often
instead
of
capital
and
then
the
fact
that
the
proceeds
are
to
be
absorbed
in
the
redemption
of
the
first
so
often
assailed
will
most
signally
attest
the
determination
of
the
country
to
maintain
its
credit
these
advantages
cost
nothing
and
it
is
difficult
to
see
why
they
should
be
renounced
we
must
not
make
an
effort
and
fail
our
course
must
be
guided
by
such
prudence
that
success
will
be
at
least
reasonably
certain
for
the
nation
to
offer
a
loan
and
be
refused
in
the
market
will
not
do
here
as
elsewhere
we
must
organize
victory
now
it
is
to
my
mind
doubtful
according
to
the
information
within
my
reach
if
the
loan
proposed
by
the
committee
can
be
negotiated
successfully
at
par
bankers
there
may
be
who
would
gladly
see
themselves
announced
as
financial
agents
of
the
great
republic
but
it
remains
to
be
seen
if
there
are
any
competent
to
handle
a
loan
of
who
would
undertake
it
on
the
terms
of
the
committee
i
am
clear
that
it
is
not
prudent
to
make
the
experiment
when
it
is
easy
to
offer
another
loan
with
positive
advantages
sufficient
to
turn
the
scale
washington
in
his
farewell
address
said
forego
the
advantages
of
so
peculiar
a
situation
why
quit
our
own
to
stand
upon
foreign
ground
in
the
same
spirit
i
would
say
why
forego
the
advantages
of
a
and
peculiar
security
why
quit
our
to
stand
upon
a
security
which
is
unknown
and
practically
foreign
whether
at
home
or
abroad
in
the
loan
proposed
by
the
original
bill
we
find
assurance
of
success
with
the
promise
of
reduced
taxation
repudiation
silenced
and
the
coin
reserves
in
the
banks
strengthened
by
sales
in
europe
it
may
be
should
the
amendment
of
the
committee
prevail
i
see
small
chance
of
any
near
accomplishment
of
these
objects
and
meanwhile
our
financial
question
is
handed
over
to
prolonged
uncertainty
i
pass
now
to
the
substitute
of
the
committee
for
the
second
and
third
sections
of
the
original
bill
here
again
the
amount
is
changed
from
to
i
am
not
aware
of
any
reason
for
this
change
nor
is
there
indeed
any
peculiar
reason
as
in
the
case
of
the
of
for
the
amount
of
the
question
between
the
two
amounts
may
properly
be
determined
by
considerations
of
expediency
among
which
will
be
that
of
uniformity
with
outstanding
loans
a
more
important
change
is
in
the
time
the
bonds
are
to
run
which
is
years
for
the
bonds
at
four
and
a
half
per
and
years
for
the
bonds
at
four
per
cent
here
occurs
again
the
argument
with
regard
to
the
inferiority
of
as
compared
with
by
the
same
reason
the
will
be
inferior
to
the
and
the
will
be
inferior
to
the
of
the
original
bill
the
prolongation
of
the
bond
is
in
the
nature
of
compensation
for
the
reduction
of
interest
already
we
have
established
the
ratio
of
compensation
for
such
reduction
already
for
a
loan
at
six
per
cent
we
have
offered
but
for
a
loan
at
five
per
cent
we
have
offered
and
i
see
no
reason
why
by
a
tentative
process
we
should
so
materially
change
this
standard
as
is
now
proposed
the
experiment
can
do
no
good
while
it
may
do
harm
it
is
in
the
nature
of
a
restriction
on
our
discretion
and
a
limitation
of
the
duration
of
the
bond
which
i
apprehend
must
interfere
essentially
with
its
marketable
character
while
the
prolongation
of
time
enlarges
the
option
of
the
nation
it
increases
the
value
of
the
bond
in
the
market
that
which
is
most
favorable
to
the
nation
is
most
favorable
to
the
market
value
of
the
bond
and
that
which
is
unfavorable
to
the
nation
is
unfavorable
also
to
the
market
value
of
the
bond
rendering
its
negotiation
and
sale
more
difficult
and
protracted
thus
at
every
turn
are
we
brought
back
to
the
original
proposition
against
this
conclusion
is
the
argument
founded
on
the
idea
of
english
consols
it
is
sometimes
said
if
the
short
term
of
years
is
the
standard
for
a
six
per
cent
bond
with
a
graduation
to
for
a
four
per
cent
bond
why
may
we
not
go
further
and
establish
consols
at
three
per
running
if
you
please
to
eternity
the
technical
term
is
an
abbreviation
for
the
consolidated
debt
of
great
britain
and
in
the
eyes
of
a
british
subject
has
its
own
signification
it
means
a
debt
never
to
be
paid
or
at
least
it
is
an
inscribed
debt
carrying
no
promise
of
payment
i
would
not
have
any
debt
of
the
united
states
assume
either
the
form
or
name
of
consols
i
would
rigidly
adhere
to
definite
periods
of
payment
this
is
the
american
system
in
contradistinction
to
the
british
system
i
would
not
only
avoid
the
idea
that
our
debt
is
permanent
but
i
would
adhere
to
the
form
of
positive
payment
at
some
fixed
period
and
keep
this
idea
always
present
in
the
minds
of
the
people
without
the
requirement
of
law
i
doubt
if
the
debt
would
be
paid
political
parties
would
court
popularity
by
a
reduction
of
taxation
the
treasury
of
the
united
states
like
the
british
treasury
would
always
be
without
a
surplus
and
the
national
debt
would
be
recognized
as
a
burden
to
be
endured
forever
therefore
do
i
say
there
is
another
consideration
having
a
wide
influence
but
especially
important
at
the
west
and
south
which
should
induce
us
to
press
for
a
reduction
of
the
interest
on
our
bonds
and
here
i
present
an
argument
which
if
not
advanced
before
is
none
the
less
applicable
do
senators
consider
to
what
extent
the
government
determines
the
rates
of
interest
in
the
money
centres
of
the
country
not
only
for
itself
does
it
determine
but
for
others
also
government
bonds
enjoy
preëminence
as
an
investment
and
if
the
interest
is
high
they
attract
the
disposable
money
of
the
country
government
sixes
are
worth
more
than
a
six
per
cent
bond
of
any
private
corporation
or
individual
no
matter
how
well
secured
therefore
it
is
easy
to
see
so
long
as
we
retain
our
standard
at
six
per
so
long
as
we
have
sixes
will
the
capital
of
the
country
seek
these
bonds
for
investment
permanent
or
temporary
to
the
detriment
of
numerous
enterprises
important
to
the
national
development
which
are
driven
to
be
the
stipendiaries
of
foreign
capital
railroads
especially
at
the
west
and
south
are
sufferers
being
sometimes
delayed
by
the
difficulty
of
borrowing
money
and
sometimes
becoming
bankrupt
from
ruinous
rates
of
interest
always
in
competition
with
the
government
but
what
is
true
of
railroads
is
also
true
of
other
enterprises
which
are
pinched
and
even
killed
by
these
exactions
in
which
the
government
plays
such
a
part
all
are
familiar
with
the
recurring
appeals
for
money
on
bonds
even
at
eight
per
which
is
more
than
can
be
paid
permanently
without
loss
and
even
at
such
a
ruinous
rate
there
is
difficulty
in
obtaining
the
required
amount
doubtless
the
excessive
interest
now
demanded
is
partly
due
to
our
fictitious
currency
where
paper
is
forced
upon
the
market
but
beyond
this
influence
is
that
of
our
sixes
absorbing
disposable
capital
i
venture
to
assert
that
if
we
could
at
an
early
day
reduce
these
sixes
to
fives
there
are
millions
which
would
be
released
to
seek
investment
in
other
securities
at
six
per
especially
to
the
relief
of
the
west
and
south
the
reduction
of
interest
to
four
and
a
half
per
cent
and
four
per
cent
would
release
further
millions
a
recent
incident
in
the
financial
history
of
massachusetts
illustrates
the
disturbing
influence
of
our
sixes
an
attempt
to
obtain
a
loan
in
europe
at
five
per
cent
was
unsuccessful
chiefly
because
the
national
government
offered
six
per
cent
therefore
for
the
sake
of
public
enterprise
in
its
manifold
forms
for
the
sake
of
that
prosperity
which
depends
on
human
industry
for
the
sake
of
manufactures
for
the
sake
of
commerce
and
especially
for
the
sake
of
railroads
by
which
all
these
are
quickened
we
must
do
what
we
can
to
reduce
the
general
rate
of
interest
which
is
now
such
a
curb
on
enterprise
and
here
we
must
begin
with
our
own
bonds
without
any
adverse
intention
the
national
government
is
a
victorious
competitor
and
the
defeated
parties
are
those
very
enterprises
whose
success
is
so
important
to
the
country
a
competition
so
destructive
should
cease
keeping
this
before
us
in
the
new
loan
we
shall
adopt
that
form
of
bond
by
which
the
interest
will
most
surely
be
reduced
thus
while
refunding
the
national
debt
we
shall
open
the
way
to
improvements
of
all
kinds
this
is
what
i
have
to
say
for
the
present
on
the
refunding
propositions
of
the
committee
their
object
is
the
same
as
mine
if
i
differ
from
them
in
details
it
is
because
after
careful
consideration
it
seems
to
me
that
in
some
particulars
their
system
may
be
improved
proceeding
from
these
pivotal
propositions
i
find
other
things
where
i
must
again
differ
when
i
first
addressed
the
senate
on
this
subject
i
took
occasion
to
declare
my
objection
to
the
idea
of
agencies
or
offices
in
the
commercial
centres
of
europe
where
interest
should
be
paid
i
am
not
ready
to
withdraw
that
objection
though
if
i
could
be
tempted
it
would
be
by
the
senator
from
ohio
sherman
when
he
held
up
the
prospect
of
a
common
money
among
nations
this
is
one
of
the
desires
of
my
heart
as
it
is
one
of
the
necessities
of
civilization
but
i
fail
to
see
how
this
aspiration
will
be
promoted
by
the
system
proposed
which
must
be
judged
on
its
own
merits
without
any
such
recommendation
it
is
easy
to
see
that
such
a
system
besides
being
the
beginning
of
a
new
policy
on
the
part
of
the
government
may
entail
serious
embarrassments
must
be
created
in
foreign
capitals
which
must
be
continued
so
long
as
the
bonds
last
remittances
of
coin
must
be
semiannual
and
should
such
remittances
fail
at
any
time
there
must
be
advances
at
no
little
cost
to
the
government
i
can
not
imagine
any
advantage
from
this
new
system
sufficient
to
induce
us
to
encounter
the
possible
embarrassments
or
entanglements
which
it
may
cause
i
would
not
take
too
much
of
the
time
of
the
senate
and
therefore
i
pass
at
once
to
the
proposition
of
the
committee
being
section
seven
providing
for
the
very
early
payment
of
the
national
debt
president
the
payment
of
the
national
debt
is
an
american
idea
and
i
would
say
nothing
to
weaken
it
among
the
people
whatever
we
owe
must
be
paid
but
it
is
the
part
of
prudence
to
make
the
payment
in
such
way
as
while
consistent
with
our
obligations
shall
promote
the
national
prosperity
in
this
spirit
i
approach
the
proposition
of
the
committee
in
which
there
is
so
much
of
good
only
to
examine
and
measure
it
in
order
to
ascertain
its
probable
influence
especially
on
the
question
of
taxation
here
it
must
be
borne
in
mind
that
the
present
measure
in
all
its
parts
so
far
as
applicable
and
especially
with
its
guaranties
and
pledges
must
be
taken
as
the
basis
of
our
new
engagements
the
provision
that
so
much
of
the
debt
shall
be
paid
annually
will
become
in
a
certain
sense
a
part
of
the
contract
although
not
so
expressed
in
the
bond
not
less
than
are
set
apart
annually
to
be
applied
the
payment
of
the
interest
and
to
the
reduction
of
the
principal
of
the
public
this
is
a
large
sum
and
we
should
consider
carefully
if
such
a
guaranty
or
pledge
has
in
it
the
promise
of
financial
stability
promising
too
much
is
sometimes
as
bad
as
promising
too
little
our
promise
must
be
according
to
our
means
prudently
employed
if
we
assume
obligations
so
large
as
to
bear
heavily
upon
the
business
of
the
country
and
to
compel
unreasonable
taxation
there
will
be
little
chance
of
financial
stability
they
will
become
the
object
of
attack
and
will
enter
into
the
conflict
of
parties
and
if
repealed
the
national
faith
may
be
called
in
question
i
need
not
say
that
business
must
suffer
a
less
ambitious
effort
on
our
part
will
be
less
obnoxious
to
attack
thus
leaving
the
bonds
to
their
natural
position
in
the
money
market
and
strengthening
all
the
movements
of
commerce
in
order
to
determine
the
operation
of
this
provision
we
must
look
into
details
i
have
the
estimates
before
me
showing
our
present
and
prospective
liabilities
for
interest
but
i
content
myself
with
presenting
compendiously
the
result
in
order
to
determine
the
question
of
taxation
suffice
it
to
say
that
under
the
operation
of
the
present
measure
there
will
be
in
after
the
payment
of
all
liabilities
for
interest
a
surplus
of
to
be
applied
to
the
payment
of
the
national
debt
with
each
succeeding
year
the
reduction
of
interest
will
rapidly
increase
this
surplus
and
when
we
bring
into
operation
other
provisions
of
the
bill
and
convert
of
sixes
into
a
like
amount
of
four
and
a
half
per
effecting
a
further
saving
of
interest
equal
to
annually
the
surplus
revenue
as
compared
with
necessary
expenditures
will
in
a
brief
period
approach
annually
here
the
question
arises
is
not
this
unnecessarily
large
is
it
not
beyond
the
bounds
of
prudence
and
wise
economy
shall
we
declare
in
this
fundamental
measure
a
determination
to
redeem
the
whole
national
debt
within
a
period
of
years
can
the
industries
of
the
country
sustain
such
taxation
i
put
the
question
you
shall
answer
it
the
future
has
its
great
claims
upon
us
so
also
has
the
present
i
submit
that
the
pending
measure
sacrifices
the
present
i
conclude
therefore
as
i
began
with
another
appeal
for
reduced
taxation
at
the
proper
time
i
shall
move
an
amendment
in
order
to
aid
this
result
in
the
course
of
the
proceedings
which
followed
the
bill
of
the
committee
underwent
important
amendments
in
accordance
with
the
views
expressed
by
sumner
for
the
and
therein
proposed
a
prolongation
to
and
being
effected
and
the
provision
for
the
payment
of
interest
at
the
and
in
the
moneys
of
europe
stricken
out
some
of
its
more
objectionable
features
being
thus
removed
he
gave
it
a
qualified
support
march
the
question
being
on
striking
out
a
provision
in
the
bill
of
the
committee
requiring
the
national
banks
to
exchange
the
bonds
of
the
united
states
deposited
by
them
as
security
for
their
circulation
for
those
bearing
a
lower
rate
of
interest
sumner
said
president
there
is
a
word
which
has
been
introduced
into
this
debate
with
which
we
were
all
very
familiar
in
another
relation
some
years
ago
it
is
the
word
a
president
of
the
united
states
announced
in
most
formal
phrase
that
we
could
not
coerce
a
state
and
now
borrowing
a
phrase
from
buchanan
we
are
told
we
can
not
coerce
a
national
bank
well
sir
is
the
phrase
applicable
if
it
be
applicable
then
i
insist
that
we
can
coerce
a
national
bank
but
i
do
not
admit
its
applicability
what
i
insist
on
has
already
been
so
ably
and
clearly
stated
by
the
chairman
of
the
committee
sherman
that
perhaps
i
need
not
add
another
word
i
do
not
like
to
occupy
your
time
yet
i
can
not
forbear
reminding
you
sir
of
the
plenary
power
which
congress
has
reserved
over
the
banking
system
in
that
very
act
by
which
it
was
established
the
senator
from
california
casserly
has
read
to
you
the
clause
we
have
been
reminded
by
a
senator
on
this
floor
that
these
are
formal
words
words
that
often
appear
in
statutes
but
are
they
not
significant
words
have
they
not
a
meaning
why
are
they
there
because
they
have
a
meaning
because
they
reserve
to
congress
what
i
call
plenary
power
over
the
whole
system
that
system
may
be
readjusted
modified
shaped
anew
and
the
banks
can
not
complain
they
began
their
existence
under
that
law
they
knew
the
conditions
of
their
being
and
they
can
not
now
murmur
if
congress
chooses
to
exercise
the
prerogative
which
it
reserved
at
the
very
inception
of
the
whole
system
sir
i
approach
this
question
therefore
with
the
conviction
that
the
whole
matter
is
open
to
our
discretion
nobody
can
say
safely
that
what
is
now
proposed
is
not
within
the
power
of
congress
congress
may
do
it
if
the
occasion
justifies
if
in
its
discretion
it
thinks
best
to
do
it
it
may
do
it
if
it
thinks
that
the
financial
policy
of
this
country
will
be
thereby
promoted
the
banks
are
all
parties
to
that
policy
may
not
the
country
turn
around
and
ask
the
banks
to
do
their
part
in
this
great
work
of
renovation
to
a
certain
extent
the
banks
are
in
partnership
with
the
government
may
not
the
government
insist
that
they
shall
do
their
part
on
this
great
occasion
shall
this
effort
of
ours
to
readjust
our
finances
and
to
save
this
large
interest
to
our
country
be
thwarted
by
a
pretension
on
the
part
of
the
banks
that
we
have
not
the
power
to
interfere
but
we
are
reminded
that
there
is
a
difference
between
power
and
right
how
often
sir
on
other
occasions
have
i
so
insisted
in
this
chamber
a
great
broad
vital
distinction
there
always
is
between
power
and
right
a
nation
or
an
individual
may
have
a
power
without
right
now
is
there
not
here
a
right
as
well
as
a
power
i
can
not
doubt
it
i
can
not
doubt
that
congress
may
rightfully
exercise
what
i
can
not
doubt
is
an
existing
power
why
should
it
not
it
could
exercise
it
who
can
doubt
with
reference
to
the
public
interests
to
promote
the
national
credit
it
will
not
exercise
it
in
any
spirit
of
wantonness
in
any
spirit
of
injustice
but
to
promote
the
national
credit
is
not
that
a
rightful
object
no
one
will
say
the
contrary
why
then
shall
we
hesitate
we
are
reminded
that
these
banks
have
secured
certain
privileges
and
it
is
said
often
that
those
are
vested
and
the
old
phrase
has
been
repeated
but
how
can
they
have
vested
rights
under
a
statute
which
contains
the
provision
just
read
to
us
securing
to
congress
full
power
to
change
it
in
every
respect
what
then
is
the
simple
aspect
of
this
question
it
is
that
certain
securities
have
been
lodged
with
the
government
by
these
banks
on
which
they
transact
their
business
and
now
in
readjusting
the
national
debt
it
is
deemed
advisable
and
for
the
public
interests
that
the
securities
should
be
at
a
lower
rate
of
interest
than
when
they
were
originally
deposited
is
it
not
right
for
congress
to
require
that
i
can
not
see
the
wrong
in
it
i
can
not
see
any
doubt
on
the
question
to
my
mind
it
is
clear
it
is
absolutely
within
the
province
of
congress
in
the
exercise
of
the
discretion
which
it
originally
retained
over
this
whole
subject
i
hope
therefore
that
in
this
debate
we
shall
not
be
pressed
too
much
with
the
suggestion
that
we
can
not
coerce
these
banks
if
the
occasion
requires
and
if
the
term
be
applicable
then
do
i
say
we
may
coerce
these
banks
to
the
extent
of
obliging
them
to
take
these
securities
at
a
reduced
rate
of
interest
i
find
no
repudiation
in
that
i
find
nothing
wrong
in
that
i
find
nothing
in
it
but
a
simple
measure
in
harmony
with
this
great
process
of
financial
reconstruction
in
which
we
are
now
engaged
i
call
it
financial
reconstruction
and
in
this
work
ought
not
the
banks
to
take
their
place
and
perform
their
part
now
sir
i
have
a
criticism
on
this
section
it
does
not
go
far
enough
the
committee
propose
that
the
banks
shall
take
one
third
of
the
three
different
kinds
of
bonds
the
five
the
four
and
a
half
and
the
four
per
cents
i
think
they
ought
to
be
required
to
take
all
in
fours
and
i
propose
to
give
the
senate
an
opportunity
of
expressing
its
judgment
on
that
proposition
i
may
be
voted
down
perhaps
i
shall
be
but
i
shall
make
a
motion
in
the
honest
endeavor
to
render
this
bill
a
practical
measure
which
can
best
succeed
i
wish
to
mature
it
i
wish
to
put
it
in
the
best
shape
possible
and
for
the
sake
of
the
banks
and
in
the
interest
of
the
banks
i
wish
such
a
measure
as
shall
have
a
reasonable
chance
of
stability
in
the
future
if
you
allow
the
banks
gains
that
are
too
large
there
will
necessarily
be
a
constant
opposition
growing
and
developing
as
their
gains
become
more
conspicuous
why
expose
the
system
to
any
such
criticism
let
us
now
revise
it
carefully
place
it
on
sure
but
moderate
foundations
so
that
it
will
have
in
itself
the
elements
of
future
stability
to
my
mind
that
is
the
more
politic
course
and
i
am
sure
it
is
not
unjust
you
and
i
president
remember
very
well
what
was
done
on
another
occasion
the
state
banks
were
taxed
out
of
existence
it
was
the
cry
them
out
of
existence
do
not
let
them
live
drive
them
from
competition
with
these
new
children
of
ours
the
national
banks
it
was
done
was
not
that
coercion
if
the
phrase
is
to
be
employed
there
was
an
occasion
for
it
but
i
am
not
aware
that
it
was
argued
certainly
it
was
with
no
great
confidence
argued
that
to
do
that
was
unjust
it
was
a
measure
of
policy
wisely
adopted
at
the
time
and
which
we
all
now
see
has
answered
well
but
if
we
could
tax
the
state
banks
out
of
existence
can
we
not
under
the
very
specific
terms
of
the
act
of
congress
to
which
these
national
banks
owe
their
existence
apply
a
rule
not
unlike
to
them
we
do
not
propose
to
tax
them
out
of
existence
but
we
propose
to
require
that
they
shall
lodge
with
the
government
securities
at
a
lower
rate
of
interest
something
has
been
said
perhaps
much
in
this
debate
with
regard
to
the
burden
that
this
will
impose
upon
the
banks
the
senator
from
ohio
sherman
has
already
answered
that
objection
and
i
do
not
know
that
i
can
add
to
his
answer
and
yet
i
am
not
aware
that
he
reminded
the
senate
that
in
this
very
bill
there
is
a
new
and
important
provision
in
favor
of
the
banks
or
in
favor
of
all
bondholders
being
an
exemption
from
all
taxation
not
only
state
and
municipal
but
national
there
is
but
one
other
remark
i
will
make
and
that
is
we
all
know
unless
i
am
much
deceived
that
the
banks
have
during
these
last
years
made
great
profits
i
am
told
that
the
profits
of
the
national
banks
are
two
or
three
times
greater
than
those
of
the
old
state
banks
which
we
did
not
hesitate
to
tax
out
of
existence
now
is
not
that
a
fact
in
this
case
is
it
not
an
essential
element
should
it
not
be
taken
into
consideration
on
this
occasion
if
these
national
banks
are
the
recipients
of
such
large
profits
should
we
not
exercise
all
the
power
that
belongs
to
us
to
compel
them
to
their
full
contribution
to
this
great
measure
of
financial
reconstruction
i
can
not
hesitate
in
my
conclusion
march
sumner
moved
the
addition
of
a
section
providing
for
the
resumption
of
specie
payments
being
the
seventh
section
of
the
original
bill
remarking
president
interested
as
i
am
in
this
bill
desirous
of
its
passage
hardly
less
than
the
senator
from
ohio
i
am
bound
to
say
that
in
my
judgment
the
passage
of
this
single
section
would
be
worth
more
than
the
whole
bill
it
would
do
more
for
the
credit
of
the
country
it
would
do
more
for
its
business
it
would
help
us
all
to
the
completion
of
financial
reconstruction
how
often
have
i
insisted
that
all
our
efforts
to
fund
and
refund
are
to
a
certain
extent
vain
and
impotent
unless
we
begin
by
specie
payments
that
sir
is
the
alpha
of
this
whole
subject
and
until
congress
is
ready
to
begin
with
that
i
fear
that
all
the
rest
will
be
of
little
avail
it
is
in
the
light
of
expedient
rather
than
of
remedy
there
is
the
remedy
the
proposition
was
negatived
congress
not
being
yet
ready
for
this
step
nathanael
greene
of
the
revolution
speech
in
the
senate
on
the
presentation
of
his
statue
january
in
the
senate
january
senator
anthony
announced
the
presentation
by
rhode
island
of
a
statue
of
nathanael
greene
of
the
revolution
executed
by
the
sculptor
brown
to
be
placed
in
the
old
hall
of
the
house
of
representatives
sumner
moved
its
acceptance
by
the
following
concurrent
resolution
a
resolution
accepting
the
statue
of
greene
by
the
senate
the
house
of
representatives
that
the
thanks
of
this
congress
be
presented
to
the
governor
and
through
him
to
the
people
of
the
state
of
rhode
island
and
providence
plantations
for
the
statue
of
greene
whose
name
is
so
honorably
identified
with
our
revolutionary
history
that
this
work
of
art
is
accepted
in
the
name
of
the
nation
and
assigned
a
place
in
the
old
hall
of
the
house
of
representatives
already
set
aside
by
act
of
congress
for
the
statues
of
eminent
citizens
and
that
a
copy
of
this
resolution
signed
by
the
president
of
the
senate
and
the
speaker
of
the
house
of
representatives
be
transmitted
to
the
governor
of
the
state
of
rhode
island
and
providence
plantations
on
this
he
spoke
as
follows
president
how
brief
is
life
how
long
is
art
nathanael
greene
died
at
the
age
of
and
now
congress
receives
his
marble
statue
destined
to
endure
until
this
capitol
crumbles
to
dust
but
art
lends
its
longevity
only
to
lives
extended
by
deeds
therefore
is
the
present
an
attestation
of
the
fame
that
has
been
won
beyond
his
own
deserts
greene
was
fortunate
during
life
in
the
praise
of
washington
who
wrote
of
singular
abilities
which
that
officer
possesses
and
then
again
fortunate
after
death
in
the
praise
of
hamilton
whose
remarkable
tribute
is
no
ordinary
record
he
has
been
fortunate
since
in
his
biographer
whose
work
promises
to
be
classical
in
our
literature
and
now
he
is
fortunate
again
in
a
statue
which
while
taking
an
honorable
place
in
american
art
is
the
first
to
be
received
in
our
pantheon
such
are
the
honors
of
patriot
service
among
the
generals
of
the
revolution
greene
was
next
after
washington
his
campaign
at
the
south
showed
military
genius
of
no
common
order
he
saved
the
south
had
he
lived
to
take
part
in
the
national
government
his
character
and
judgment
must
have
secured
for
him
an
eminent
post
of
service
unlike
his
two
great
associates
washington
and
hamilton
his
life
was
confined
to
war
but
the
capacities
he
manifested
in
command
gave
assurance
that
he
would
have
excelled
in
civil
life
his
resources
in
the
field
would
have
been
the
same
in
the
council
chamber
of
quaker
extraction
greene
was
originally
a
quaker
the
quaker
became
a
soldier
and
commander
of
armies
such
was
the
requirement
of
the
epoch
should
a
soldier
and
commander
of
armies
in
our
day
accept
ideas
which
enter
into
the
life
of
the
quaker
the
change
would
only
be
in
harmony
with
those
principles
which
must
soon
prevail
ordaining
peace
and
among
men
looking
at
his
statue
with
military
coat
and
with
sword
in
hand
i
seem
to
see
his
early
garb
beneath
the
quaker
general
could
never
have
been
other
than
the
friend
of
peace
standing
always
in
that
beautiful
hall
the
statue
will
be
a
perpetual
though
silent
orator
the
marble
will
speak
nor
is
it
difficult
to
divine
the
lesson
it
must
teach
he
lived
for
his
country
and
his
whole
country
nothing
less
born
in
the
north
he
died
in
the
south
which
he
had
made
his
home
the
grateful
south
honored
him
as
the
north
had
already
done
his
life
exhibits
the
beauty
and
the
reward
of
patriotism
how
can
his
marble
speak
except
for
country
in
all
its
parts
and
at
all
points
of
the
compass
it
was
for
the
whole
country
that
he
drew
his
sword
of
so
also
for
the
whole
country
was
the
sword
drawn
in
these
latter
days
and
yet
there
was
a
difference
between
the
two
occasions
easy
to
state
our
cause
for
which
greene
contended
was
national
independence
our
cause
recently
triumphant
in
bloodiest
war
was
liberty
and
equality
the
declared
heritage
of
all
mankind
the
first
war
was
for
separation
from
the
mother
country
according
to
the
terms
of
the
declaration
these
united
colonies
are
and
of
right
ought
to
be
free
and
independent
states
the
object
being
elevated
by
the
great
principles
announced
the
second
war
was
for
the
establishment
of
these
great
principles
without
which
republican
government
is
a
name
and
nothing
more
but
both
were
for
country
the
larger
masses
with
the
larger
scale
of
military
operations
in
the
latter
may
eclipse
the
earlier
and
it
is
impossible
not
to
see
that
a
war
for
liberty
and
equality
making
the
promises
of
the
declaration
a
reality
and
giving
to
mankind
an
irresistible
example
is
loftier
in
character
than
a
war
for
separation
if
hereafter
greene
finds
rivals
near
his
statue
they
will
be
those
who
represented
our
cause
in
its
later
peril
and
its
larger
triumph
just
in
proportion
as
ideas
are
involved
is
conflict
elevated
especially
if
those
ideas
concern
the
equal
rights
of
all
greene
died
at
the
south
and
nobody
knows
the
place
of
his
burial
he
lies
without
epitaph
or
tombstone
a
grateful
country
writes
his
epitaph
and
gives
him
a
monument
in
the
capitol
personal
record
on
reconstruction
with
colored
suffrage
remarks
in
the
senate
january
and
february
the
arraignment
of
sumner
by
trumbull
of
illinois
in
the
closing
debate
on
the
virginia
bill
january
included
as
remarked
in
that
connection
a
reference
to
matters
of
earlier
date
specifically
among
these
being
the
reconstruction
act
of
march
conferring
upon
the
colored
people
of
the
rebel
states
equality
of
suffrage
with
the
whites
adverting
to
the
fact
that
this
bill
was
an
amendment
in
the
nature
of
a
substitute
for
one
from
the
house
and
then
reading
the
names
of
the
senators
who
voted
for
it
trumbull
asked
president
do
you
miss
the
name
of
any
senator
from
that
list
of
yeas
that
was
the
vote
by
which
that
amendment
was
the
were
among
others
and
upon
this
showing
trumbull
concluded
that
the
colored
citizens
of
the
south
have
nothing
to
thank
the
senator
from
massachusetts
for
in
having
the
right
of
suffrage
conferred
upon
trumbull
continued
president
this
was
not
the
only
vote
a
vote
was
taken
after
this
amendment
was
adopted
upon
the
passage
of
the
bill
thus
amended
and
the
vote
on
the
passage
of
the
bill
was
yeas
nays
and
among
those
yeas
is
not
found
the
name
of
the
senator
from
massachusetts
sir
it
sometimes
happens
that
malice
and
hatred
will
produce
results
which
reason
and
can
never
accomplish
and
when
we
passed
this
bill
giving
the
right
of
suffrage
to
the
colored
men
in
the
south
without
the
aid
of
the
senator
from
massachusetts
and
sent
it
to
the
president
johnson
he
vetoed
it
and
on
the
question
of
passing
it
over
his
veto
the
senator
from
massachusetts
voted
with
us
his
affection
for
the
president
was
not
such
as
to
allow
him
to
coincide
with
him
in
anything
so
we
got
his
vote
at
last
but
we
had
without
him
is
the
record
sumner
answered
this
assault
compels
me
to
make
a
statement
now
which
i
never
supposed
i
should
be
called
to
make
i
make
it
now
with
hesitation
but
rather
to
show
the
course
than
my
own
sir
i
am
the
author
of
the
provision
in
that
act
conferring
suffrage
and
when
i
brought
it
forward
the
senator
from
illinois
was
one
of
my
opponents
then
as
now
senators
who
were
here
at
that
time
remember
well
that
this
whole
subject
was
practically
taken
for
the
time
from
the
jurisdiction
of
the
senate
into
a
caucus
of
the
republican
party
where
a
committee
was
created
to
whom
all
pending
measures
of
reconstruction
were
referred
i
had
the
honor
of
being
a
member
of
that
committee
so
was
the
senator
from
illinois
so
was
my
friend
from
michigan
howard
the
senator
from
ohio
sherman
was
our
chairman
in
that
committee
this
reconstruction
bill
was
debated
and
matured
sentence
by
sentence
word
for
word
and
then
and
there
in
that
committee
i
moved
that
we
should
require
the
suffrage
of
all
persons
without
distinction
of
color
in
the
organization
of
new
governments
and
in
all
the
constitutions
to
be
made
in
making
this
proposition
at
that
time
i
only
followed
the
proposition
i
had
made
in
the
senate
two
years
before
which
i
had
urged
upon
the
people
in
an
elaborate
address
at
a
political
convention
in
massachusetts
which
i
had
again
upheld
in
an
elaborate
effort
for
two
days
in
this
chamber
and
which
from
the
beginning
i
had
never
lost
from
my
mind
or
heart
it
was
natural
that
i
should
press
it
in
committee
but
i
was
overruled
the
senator
opposing
me
with
his
accustomed
determination
i
was
voted
down
the
chairman
observed
my
discontent
and
said
can
renew
your
motion
in
i
did
so
stating
that
i
had
been
voted
down
in
committee
but
that
i
appealed
from
the
committee
to
the
caucus
my
colleague
wilson
who
sits
before
me
called
out
and
then
rising
said
in
language
which
he
will
pardon
me
for
quoting
but
which
will
do
him
honor
always
report
of
the
committee
will
leave
a
great
question
open
to
debate
on
every
square
mile
of
the
south
we
must
close
that
question
another
senator
who
is
not
now
here
i
can
therefore
name
him
gratz
brown
of
missouri
cried
out
most
earnestly
it
to
a
vote
we
will
stand
by
i
needed
no
such
encouragement
for
my
determination
was
fixed
there
sat
the
senator
from
illinois
sullen
in
his
accustomed
opposition
i
pushed
it
to
a
vote
and
it
was
carried
by
only
two
majority
senators
rising
to
be
counted
my
colleague
in
his
joy
on
the
occasion
exclaimed
is
the
greatest
vote
that
has
been
taken
on
this
continent
he
felt
i
felt
we
all
felt
that
the
question
of
the
suffrage
was
then
and
there
secured
by
that
vote
the
committee
was
directed
to
make
it
a
part
of
reconstruction
this
was
done
and
the
measure
thus
amended
was
reported
by
the
senator
from
ohio
as
chairman
of
the
committee
i
am
compelled
to
this
statement
by
the
assault
of
the
senator
i
had
no
disposition
to
make
it
i
do
not
claim
anything
for
myself
i
did
nothing
but
my
duty
had
i
done
less
i
should
have
been
faithless
i
should
have
been
where
the
senator
from
illinois
placed
himself
the
senator
read
from
the
the
vote
on
the
passage
of
the
bill
and
exulted
because
my
name
was
not
there
sir
is
there
any
senator
in
this
chamber
whose
name
will
be
found
oftener
on
the
yeas
and
nays
than
my
own
is
there
any
senator
in
this
chamber
who
is
away
from
his
seat
less
than
i
am
there
was
a
reason
for
my
absence
on
that
occasion
i
left
this
chamber
at
midnight
fatigued
not
well
knowing
that
the
great
cause
was
assured
notwithstanding
the
opposition
of
the
senator
from
illinois
knowing
that
at
last
the
right
of
the
colored
people
to
suffrage
was
recognized
i
had
seen
it
placed
in
the
bill
reported
from
the
committee
there
it
was
on
my
motion
safe
against
the
assaults
of
the
senator
from
illinois
why
should
i
fatigued
and
not
well
remain
till
morning
to
swell
the
large
and
ascertained
majority
which
it
was
destined
to
receive
i
have
no
occasion
to
make
up
any
such
record
you
know
my
fidelity
to
this
cause
you
know
if
i
am
in
the
habit
of
avoiding
the
responsibilities
of
my
position
i
can
not
disguise
also
that
there
was
another
influence
on
my
mind
reconstruction
even
with
the
suffrage
was
defective
more
was
needed
there
should
have
been
a
system
of
public
schools
greater
protection
to
the
freedmen
and
more
security
against
the
rebels
all
of
which
i
sought
in
vain
to
obtain
in
committee
and
i
found
all
effort
in
the
senate
foreclosed
by
our
action
in
caucus
pained
by
this
failure
and
feeling
that
there
was
nothing
more
for
me
to
do
after
midnight
i
withdrew
on
the
return
of
the
act
to
the
senate
on
the
veto
of
the
president
i
recorded
my
vote
in
its
favor
what
trumbull
calls
in
this
case
and
which
sumner
in
the
surprise
of
the
occasion
seemingly
accepts
according
to
the
obvious
import
of
the
term
as
substantially
the
complete
record
inspection
of
either
the
congressional
globe
or
the
senate
journal
shows
to
be
very
far
from
complete
the
vote
following
the
presidential
veto
was
by
no
means
the
only
one
in
which
name
appears
between
this
and
the
vote
which
would
seem
from
the
representation
to
have
next
preceded
designated
as
vote
on
the
passage
of
the
bill
there
intervened
another
involving
in
an
important
degree
the
character
and
fate
of
the
whole
measure
the
bill
in
its
original
form
as
it
came
from
the
house
was
purely
as
indicated
by
its
title
bill
to
provide
for
the
more
efficient
government
of
the
insurrectionary
states
dividing
them
into
military
districts
and
placing
them
under
military
rule
this
being
deemed
the
only
effectual
means
of
suppressing
the
outrages
continually
perpetrated
upon
the
loyalists
of
the
south
black
and
white
its
reconstruction
features
which
included
the
provision
for
colored
suffrage
being
engrafted
upon
it
by
the
senate
coupled
with
considerable
modifications
of
its
military
details
it
was
on
the
votes
at
this
stage
february
that
name
was
wanting
on
the
return
of
the
bill
to
the
house
for
concurrence
in
these
amendments
it
at
once
encountered
on
the
republican
side
severe
animadversion
aptly
expressed
in
the
remark
sent
to
the
senate
a
proposition
to
meet
the
necessities
of
the
hour
which
was
protection
without
reconstruction
and
it
sends
back
another
which
is
reconstruction
without
concurrence
was
refused
and
a
committee
of
conference
asked
the
senate
insisting
and
declining
the
proposed
conference
the
house
proceeded
alone
supplementing
the
reconstruction
provisions
with
others
guarding
against
rebel
domination
and
crowning
their
work
with
the
emphatic
vote
of
yeas
to
nays
to
this
vote
the
senate
yielded
by
a
concurrent
vote
of
yeas
nays
with
effect
as
announced
passing
the
sumner
hailing
these
amendments
as
what
he
had
required
of
course
voted
with
the
yeas
and
his
name
so
stands
on
both
of
the
official
registers
in
immediate
conjunction
with
mr
this
was
on
the
of
february
the
vote
consequent
upon
the
veto
was
ten
days
later
when
his
name
was
again
recorded
with
the
yeas
these
two
were
the
only
votes
in
the
senate
on
the
reconstruction
act
of
march
in
the
completeness
of
its
provisions
as
it
appears
in
the
february
the
bill
for
the
admission
of
mississippi
having
come
up
for
consideration
in
the
senate
stewart
of
nevada
availed
himself
of
the
opportunity
to
reopen
the
personal
controversy
with
sumner
in
an
acrimonious
speech
denying
his
claim
to
the
authorship
of
the
provision
for
colored
suffrage
in
the
reconstruction
act
of
and
ascribing
it
to
bingham
of
ohio
a
member
of
the
other
house
quoting
opening
declaration
on
this
point
but
resisting
the
reading
of
what
followed
in
explanation
and
support
of
that
declaration
under
the
plea
that
did
not
want
it
printed
as
part
of
his
own
on
the
conclusion
of
speech
sumner
answered
as
follows
president
you
will
bear
witness
that
i
am
no
volunteer
now
i
have
been
no
volunteer
on
any
of
these
recurring
occasions
when
i
have
been
assailed
in
this
chamber
i
have
begun
no
question
i
began
no
question
with
the
senator
from
nevada
i
began
no
question
with
the
other
senator
on
my
right
trumbull
i
began
no
question
yesterday
with
the
senator
from
new
york
mr
conkling
i
began
no
question
either
with
the
senator
from
wisconsin
mr
carpenter
but
i
am
here
to
answer
and
i
begin
by
asking
to
have
read
at
the
desk
what
i
did
say
and
what
the
senator
from
nevada
was
unwilling
as
he
declared
to
have
incorporated
in
his
speech
i
can
understand
that
he
was
very
unwilling
i
send
the
passage
to
the
chair
the
passage
referred
to
embracing
the
first
three
paragraphs
of
statement
in
answer
to
trumbull
january
having
been
read
he
proceeded
that
statement
is
to
the
effect
that
on
my
motion
that
important
proposition
was
put
into
the
bill
does
anybody
question
it
has
the
impeachment
of
the
senator
impaired
that
statement
by
a
he
shows
that
in
another
part
of
this
capitol
patriot
representatives
were
striving
in
the
same
direction
all
honor
to
them
god
forbid
that
i
should
ever
grudge
to
any
of
my
associates
in
this
great
controversy
any
of
the
fame
that
belongs
to
them
there
is
enough
for
all
provided
we
have
been
faithful
sir
it
is
not
in
my
nature
to
take
from
any
one
credit
character
fame
to
which
he
is
justly
entitled
the
world
is
wide
enough
for
all
let
each
enjoy
what
he
has
earned
i
ask
nothing
for
myself
i
asked
nothing
the
other
day
what
i
said
was
only
in
reply
to
the
impeachment
the
arraignment
let
me
call
it
by
the
senator
from
illinois
i
then
simply
said
it
was
on
my
motion
that
this
identical
requirement
went
into
the
bill
the
senator
in
reply
seeks
to
show
that
in
the
other
chamber
a
similar
proposition
was
brought
forward
but
it
did
not
become
a
part
of
the
bill
he
shows
that
it
was
brought
forward
in
this
chamber
but
did
not
become
a
part
of
the
bill
it
was
on
my
motion
that
it
did
become
a
part
of
the
bill
it
was
not
unnatural
perhaps
that
i
should
go
further
as
i
did
and
say
that
in
making
this
motion
i
only
acted
in
harmony
with
my
life
and
best
exertions
for
years
i
have
the
whole
record
here
shall
i
open
it
i
hesitate
in
doing
so
i
break
a
vow
with
myself
and
yet
it
can
not
be
necessary
you
know
me
in
this
chamber
you
know
how
i
have
devoted
myself
from
the
beginning
to
this
idea
how
constantly
i
have
maintained
it
and
urged
it
from
the
earliest
date
the
first
stage
in
this
series
you
anthony
of
rhode
island
in
the
chair
remember
it
you
were
here
the
senator
from
nevada
was
not
here
goes
to
february
when
sumner
submitted
resolutions
declaratory
of
the
relations
between
the
united
states
and
the
territory
once
occupied
by
certain
states
and
now
usurped
by
pretended
governments
without
constitutional
or
legal
in
these
resolutions
it
is
declared
that
after
an
act
of
secession
followed
by
war
territory
falls
under
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
congress
as
other
territory
and
the
state
becomes
according
to
the
language
of
the
law
de
the
resolutions
conclude
as
follows
that
in
pursuance
of
this
duty
cast
upon
congress
and
further
enjoined
by
the
constitution
congress
will
assume
complete
jurisdiction
of
such
vacated
territory
where
such
unconstitutional
and
illegal
things
have
been
attempted
and
will
proceed
to
establish
therein
republican
forms
of
government
under
the
constitution
and
in
the
execution
of
this
trust
will
provide
carefully
for
the
protection
of
all
the
inhabitants
thereof
for
the
security
of
families
the
organization
of
labor
the
encouragement
of
industry
and
the
welfare
of
society
and
will
in
every
way
discharge
the
duties
of
a
just
merciful
and
paternal
sir
there
was
the
beginning
of
reconstruction
in
this
chamber
that
was
its
earliest
expression
on
the
of
february
it
appears
that
sumner
submitted
resolutions
defining
the
character
of
the
national
contest
and
protesting
against
any
premature
restoration
of
rebel
states
without
proper
guaranties
and
safeguards
against
slavery
and
for
the
protection
of
and
on
the
same
day
it
appears
that
he
submitted
the
following
amendment
to
the
constitution
which
had
it
been
adopted
then
would
have
cured
many
of
the
difficulties
that
have
since
occurred
entitled
of
the
constitution
securing
equality
before
the
law
and
the
abolition
of
it
is
as
follows
persons
are
equal
before
the
law
so
that
no
person
can
hold
another
as
a
slave
and
the
congress
shall
have
power
to
make
all
laws
necessary
and
proper
to
carry
this
declaration
into
effect
everywhere
within
the
united
states
and
the
jurisdiction
there
sir
was
the
beginning
of
bills
and
bills
on
the
same
day
it
appears
that
sumner
introduced
into
the
senate
bill
to
secure
equality
before
the
law
in
the
courts
of
the
united
the
debate
went
on
on
the
of
february
a
resolution
of
the
judiciary
committee
was
pending
recognizing
the
state
government
of
louisiana
sumner
on
that
day
introduced
resolutions
thus
entitled
declaring
the
duty
of
the
united
states
to
guaranty
republican
governments
in
the
rebel
states
on
the
basis
of
the
declaration
of
independence
so
that
new
that
is
the
reconstructed
governments
be
founded
on
the
consent
of
the
governed
and
the
equality
of
all
persons
before
the
of
this
series
of
resolutions
i
will
read
two
the
path
of
justice
is
also
the
path
of
peace
and
that
for
the
sake
of
peace
it
is
better
to
obey
the
constitution
and
in
conformity
with
its
requirements
in
the
performance
of
the
guaranty
to
reëstablish
state
governments
on
the
consent
of
the
governed
and
the
equality
of
all
persons
before
the
law
to
the
end
that
the
foundations
thereof
may
be
permanent
and
that
no
loyal
majorities
may
be
again
overthrown
or
ruled
by
any
oligarchical
then
comes
another
resolution
considerations
of
expediency
are
in
harmony
with
the
requirements
of
the
constitution
and
the
dictates
of
justice
and
reason
especially
now
when
colored
soldiers
have
shown
their
military
value
that
as
their
muskets
are
needed
for
the
national
defence
against
rebels
in
the
field
so
are
their
ballots
yet
more
needed
against
the
subtle
enemies
of
the
union
at
home
and
that
without
their
support
at
the
the
cause
of
human
rights
and
of
the
union
itself
will
be
in
constant
on
the
resolution
reported
by
the
senator
from
illinois
for
the
admission
of
louisiana
without
equal
rights
i
had
the
honor
of
moving
the
very
proposition
now
in
question
under
date
of
february
that
this
shall
not
take
effect
except
upon
the
fundamental
condition
within
the
state
there
shall
be
no
denial
of
the
electoral
franchise
or
of
any
other
rights
on
account
of
color
or
race
but
all
persons
shall
be
equal
before
the
here
was
the
first
motion
in
this
chamber
for
equality
of
suffrage
as
a
measure
of
reconstruction
i
entitled
it
at
the
time
of
but
here
sir
it
was
my
misfortune
to
encounter
the
strenuous
opposition
of
the
senator
from
illinois
i
allude
to
this
with
reluctance
i
have
not
opened
this
debate
and
i
quote
what
i
do
now
simply
in
reply
to
the
senator
from
nevada
replying
on
that
occasion
to
the
senator
from
illinois
i
said
united
states
are
bound
by
the
constitution
to
to
every
state
in
this
union
a
republican
form
of
now
when
called
to
perform
this
guaranty
it
is
proposed
to
recognize
an
oligarchy
of
the
skin
the
pretended
state
government
in
louisiana
is
utterly
indefensible
whether
you
look
at
its
origin
or
its
character
to
describe
it
i
must
use
plain
language
it
is
a
mere
abortion
begotten
by
the
bayonet
in
criminal
conjunction
with
the
spirit
of
caste
and
born
before
its
time
rickety
unformed
unfinished
whose
continued
existence
will
be
a
burden
a
reproach
and
a
wrong
that
is
the
whole
case
and
yet
the
senator
from
illinois
now
presses
it
upon
the
senate
at
this
moment
to
the
exclusion
of
the
important
public
business
of
the
the
louisiana
bill
though
pressed
by
the
senator
from
illinois
was
defeated
and
the
equal
rights
of
the
colored
race
were
happily
vindicated
his
opposition
was
strenuous
but
sir
i
did
not
content
myself
with
action
in
this
chamber
our
good
president
was
assassinated
the
succeeded
to
his
place
being
here
in
washington
i
entered
at
once
into
relations
with
him
hoping
to
bring
if
possible
his
great
influence
in
favor
of
this
measure
of
reconstruction
and
here
is
a
record
made
shortly
afterward
which
i
will
read
this
period
i
saw
the
president
frequently
sometimes
at
the
private
house
he
then
occupied
and
sometimes
at
his
office
in
the
treasury
on
these
occasions
the
constant
topic
was
which
was
considered
in
every
variety
of
aspect
more
than
once
i
ventured
to
press
upon
him
the
duty
and
the
renown
of
carrying
out
the
principles
of
the
declaration
of
independence
and
of
founding
the
new
governments
in
the
rebel
states
on
the
consent
of
the
governed
without
any
distinction
of
color
to
this
earnest
appeal
he
replied
on
one
occasion
as
i
sat
with
him
alone
in
words
which
i
can
never
forget
this
question
sumner
there
is
no
difference
between
us
you
and
i
are
need
i
say
that
i
was
touched
to
the
heart
by
this
annunciation
which
seemed
to
promise
a
victory
without
a
battle
accustomed
to
controversy
i
saw
clearly
that
if
the
president
declared
himself
in
favor
of
the
equal
rights
of
all
the
good
cause
must
prevail
without
then
followed
another
incident
another
occasion
during
the
same
period
the
case
of
tennessee
was
discussed
i
expressed
the
hope
most
earnestly
that
the
president
would
use
his
influence
directly
for
the
establishment
of
impartial
suffrage
in
that
state
saying
that
in
this
way
tennessee
would
be
put
at
the
head
of
the
returning
column
and
be
made
an
example
in
one
word
that
all
the
other
states
would
be
obliged
to
dress
on
tennessee
the
president
replied
that
if
he
were
at
nashville
he
would
see
that
this
was
accomplished
i
could
not
help
rejoining
promptly
that
he
need
not
be
at
nashville
for
at
washington
his
hand
was
on
the
long
end
of
the
lever
with
which
he
could
easily
move
all
tennessee
referring
of
course
to
the
powerful
but
legitimate
influence
which
the
president
might
exercise
in
his
own
state
by
the
expression
of
his
then
again
as
i
was
about
to
leave
on
my
return
home
to
massachusetts
in
an
interview
with
him
i
ventured
to
express
my
desires
and
aspirations
as
follows
this
was
in
may
remarking
that
the
rebel
region
was
still
in
military
occupation
and
that
it
was
the
plain
duty
of
the
president
to
use
his
temporary
power
for
the
establishment
of
correct
principles
i
proceeded
to
say
see
to
it
that
no
newspaper
is
allowed
which
is
not
thoroughly
loyal
and
does
not
speak
well
of
the
national
government
and
of
equal
and
here
i
reminded
him
of
the
saying
of
the
duke
of
wellington
that
in
a
place
under
martial
law
an
unlicensed
press
was
as
impossible
as
on
the
deck
of
a
ship
of
war
let
the
officers
that
you
send
as
military
governors
or
otherwise
be
known
for
their
devotion
to
equal
rights
so
that
their
names
alone
will
be
a
proclamation
while
their
simple
presence
will
help
educate
the
and
here
i
mentioned
carl
schurz
who
still
held
his
commission
in
the
army
as
such
a
person
encourage
the
population
to
resume
the
profitable
labors
of
agriculture
commerce
and
manufactures
without
delay
but
for
the
present
to
avoid
politics
fourthly
keep
the
whole
rebel
region
under
these
good
influences
and
at
the
proper
moment
hand
over
the
subject
of
reconstruction
with
the
great
question
of
equal
rights
to
the
judgment
of
congress
where
it
all
this
the
president
received
at
the
time
with
perfect
kindness
and
i
mention
this
with
the
more
readiness
because
i
remember
to
have
seen
in
the
papers
a
very
different
before
i
left
washington
and
in
the
midst
of
my
interviews
with
the
president
i
was
honored
by
a
communication
from
colored
citizens
of
north
carolina
asking
my
counsel
with
regard
to
their
rights
especially
the
right
to
vote
i
will
not
read
their
letter
it
was
published
in
the
papers
of
the
time
and
much
commented
upon
but
i
will
read
my
reply
may
i
am
glad
that
the
colored
citizens
of
north
carolina
are
ready
to
take
part
in
the
organization
of
government
it
is
unquestionably
their
right
and
duty
see
little
chance
of
peace
or
tranquillity
in
any
rebel
state
unless
the
rights
of
all
are
recognized
without
distinction
of
color
on
this
foundation
we
must
build
article
on
reconstruction
to
which
you
call
my
attention
proceeds
on
the
idea
born
of
slavery
that
persons
with
a
white
skin
are
the
only
this
is
a
mistake
you
do
me
the
honor
to
ask
me
the
proper
stand
for
you
to
make
i
have
no
hesitation
in
replying
that
you
must
insist
on
all
the
rights
and
privileges
of
a
citizen
they
belong
to
you
they
are
yours
and
whoever
undertakes
to
rob
you
of
them
is
a
usurper
and
impostor
course
you
will
take
part
in
any
primary
meetings
for
political
organization
open
to
citizens
generally
and
will
not
miss
any
opportunity
to
show
your
loyalty
and
fidelity
my
best
wishes
and
believe
me
gentlemen
faithfully
yours
such
was
my
earnestness
in
this
work
that
when
invited
by
the
municipality
of
boston
where
i
was
born
and
have
always
lived
to
address
my
in
commemoration
of
the
late
president
i
deemed
it
my
duty
to
dedicate
the
day
mainly
to
a
vindication
of
equal
rights
as
represented
by
him
i
hold
in
my
hand
the
address
on
that
occasion
from
which
i
will
read
one
passage
this
was
on
the
of
june
argument
for
colored
suffrage
is
overwhelming
it
springs
from
the
necessity
of
the
case
as
well
as
from
the
rights
of
man
this
suffrage
is
needed
for
the
security
of
the
colored
people
for
the
stability
of
the
local
government
and
for
the
strength
of
the
union
without
it
there
is
nothing
but
insecurity
for
the
colored
people
instability
for
the
local
government
and
weakness
for
the
union
involving
of
course
the
national
this
was
followed
by
a
letter
dated
boston
july
addressed
to
the
colored
people
of
savannah
who
had
done
me
the
honor
of
forwarding
to
me
a
petition
asking
for
the
right
to
vote
with
the
request
that
i
would
present
it
to
the
president
after
saying
that
had
i
been
at
washington
i
should
have
had
great
pleasure
in
presenting
the
petition
personally
but
that
i
was
obliged
to
content
myself
with
another
method
i
proceeded
in
this
way
me
to
add
that
you
must
not
be
impatient
you
have
borne
the
heavier
burdens
of
slavery
and
as
these
are
now
removed
believe
the
others
surely
will
be
also
this
enfranchised
republic
setting
an
example
to
mankind
can
not
continue
to
sanction
an
odious
oligarchy
whose
single
distinctive
element
is
color
i
have
no
doubt
that
you
will
be
admitted
to
the
privileges
of
citizens
is
impossible
to
suppose
that
congress
will
sanction
governments
in
the
rebel
states
which
are
not
founded
on
consent
of
the
this
is
the
of
republican
institutions
of
course
by
the
is
meant
all
the
loyal
citizens
without
distinction
of
color
anything
else
is
mockery
neglect
your
work
but
meanwhile
prepare
yourselves
for
the
privileges
of
citizens
they
are
yours
of
right
and
i
do
not
doubt
that
they
will
be
yours
soon
in
reality
the
prejudice
of
caste
and
a
false
interpretation
of
the
constitution
can
not
prevail
against
justice
and
common
sense
both
of
which
are
on
your
side
and
i
may
add
the
constitution
also
which
when
properly
interpreted
is
clearly
on
your
side
my
best
wishes
and
believe
me
faithfully
yours
this
was
followed
by
an
elaborate
speech
before
the
republican
state
convention
at
worcester
september
entitled
national
security
and
the
national
faith
guaranties
for
the
national
freedman
and
the
national
creditor
where
i
insisted
that
national
peace
and
tranquillity
could
be
had
only
from
and
i
believe
that
it
was
on
this
occasion
that
this
phrase
which
has
since
become
a
formula
of
politics
was
first
publicly
employed
my
language
was
as
follows
the
national
peace
and
tranquillity
depend
essentially
upon
the
overthrow
of
monopoly
and
tyranny
here
is
another
occasion
for
special
guaranty
against
the
whole
pretension
of
color
rebel
state
can
be
readmitted
with
this
controversy
still
raging
and
ready
to
break
mark
the
words
if
you
please
long
as
it
continues
the
land
will
be
barren
agriculture
and
business
of
all
kinds
will
be
uncertain
and
the
country
will
be
handed
over
to
a
fearful
struggle
with
the
terrors
of
san
domingo
to
darken
the
prospect
in
shutting
out
the
freedman
from
his
equal
rights
at
the
you
open
the
doors
of
discontent
and
insurrection
cavaignac
the
patriotic
president
of
the
french
republic
met
the
present
case
when
speaking
for
france
he
said
do
not
believe
repose
possible
either
in
the
present
or
the
future
except
so
far
as
you
found
your
political
condition
on
universal
suffrage
loyally
sincerely
completely
accepted
and
i
then
proceeded
not
adopting
the
term
suffrage
employed
by
the
eminent
frenchman
as
follows
is
that
i
claim
without
distinction
of
color
so
that
there
shall
be
one
equal
rule
for
all
men
and
this
too
must
be
placed
under
the
safeguard
of
constitutional
i
followed
up
this
effort
by
a
communication
to
that
powerful
and
extensively
circulated
paper
the
new
york
under
date
of
boston
october
where
i
expressed
myself
as
follows
the
sake
of
the
whole
country
which
suffers
from
weakness
in
any
part
for
the
sake
of
the
states
lately
distracted
by
war
which
above
all
things
need
security
and
repose
for
the
sake
of
agriculture
which
is
neglected
there
for
the
sake
of
commerce
which
has
fled
for
the
sake
of
the
national
creditor
whose
generous
trust
is
exposed
to
repudiation
and
finally
for
the
sake
of
reconciliation
which
can
be
complete
only
when
justice
prevails
we
must
insist
upon
equal
rights
as
the
condition
of
the
new
order
of
mark
if
you
please
sir
the
condition
of
the
new
order
of
things
or
as
i
called
it
on
other
occasions
the
of
reconstruction
long
as
this
question
remains
unsettled
there
can
be
no
true
peace
therefore
i
would
say
to
the
merchant
who
wishes
to
open
trade
with
this
region
to
the
capitalist
who
would
send
his
money
there
to
the
emigrant
who
seeks
to
find
a
home
there
begin
by
assuring
justice
to
all
men
this
is
the
one
essential
condition
of
prosperity
of
credit
and
of
tranquillity
without
this
mercantile
houses
banks
and
emigration
societies
having
anything
to
do
with
this
region
must
all
fail
or
at
least
suffer
in
business
and
resources
to
congress
we
must
look
as
guardian
under
the
constitution
of
the
national
meanwhile
the
president
adopted
a
policy
of
reaction
i
was
at
home
in
massachusetts
and
from
boston
under
date
of
november
i
addressed
him
a
telegraphic
dispatch
as
follows
the
president
of
the
united
states
washington
a
faithful
friend
and
supporter
of
your
administration
i
most
respectfully
petition
you
to
suspend
for
the
present
your
policy
towards
the
rebel
states
i
should
not
present
this
prayer
if
i
were
not
painfully
convinced
that
thus
far
it
has
failed
to
obtain
any
reasonable
guaranties
for
that
security
in
the
future
which
is
essential
to
peace
and
reconciliation
to
my
mind
it
abandons
the
freedmen
to
the
control
of
their
ancient
masters
and
leaves
the
national
debt
exposed
to
repudiation
by
returning
rebels
the
declaration
of
independence
asserts
the
equality
of
all
men
and
that
rightful
government
can
be
founded
only
on
the
consent
of
the
governed
i
see
small
chance
of
peace
unless
these
great
principles
are
practically
established
without
this
the
house
will
continue
divided
against
itself
sumner
of
the
united
not
content
with
these
efforts
in
an
article
more
literary
than
political
in
its
character
which
found
a
place
in
the
for
december
entitled
and
common
sense
a
curiosity
of
literature
with
a
moral
i
again
returned
to
this
same
question
i
will
quote
only
a
brief
passage
we
are
told
gravely
that
the
national
power
which
decreed
emancipation
can
not
maintain
it
by
assuring
universal
enfranchisement
because
an
imperial
government
must
be
discountenanced
as
if
the
whole
suggestion
of
or
were
not
out
of
place
until
the
national
security
is
established
and
our
debts
whether
to
the
national
freedman
or
the
national
creditor
are
placed
where
they
can
not
be
repudiated
a
phantom
is
created
and
to
avoid
this
phantom
we
drive
towards
concession
and
compromise
as
from
charybdis
to
the
session
of
congress
opened
december
and
you
will
find
that
on
the
first
day
i
introduced
two
distinct
measures
of
reconstruction
with
equality
before
the
law
as
their
the
first
was
a
bill
in
the
following
terms
bill
in
part
execution
of
the
guaranty
of
a
republican
form
of
government
in
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
it
is
declared
in
the
constitution
that
the
united
states
shall
guaranty
to
every
state
in
this
union
a
republican
form
of
government
and
whereas
certain
states
have
allowed
their
governments
to
be
subverted
by
rebellion
so
that
the
duty
is
now
cast
upon
congress
of
executing
this
guaranty
now
therefore
it
enacted
that
in
all
states
lately
declared
to
be
in
rebellion
there
shall
be
no
oligarchy
invested
with
peculiar
privileges
and
powers
and
there
shall
be
no
denial
of
rights
civil
or
political
on
account
of
race
or
color
but
all
persons
shall
be
equal
before
the
law
whether
in
the
or
at
the
and
this
statute
made
in
pursuance
of
the
constitution
shall
be
the
supreme
law
of
the
land
anything
in
the
constitution
or
laws
of
any
such
state
to
the
contrary
the
second
was
bill
to
enforce
the
guaranty
of
a
republican
form
of
government
in
certain
states
whose
governments
have
been
usurped
or
read
this
bill
if
you
please
sir
i
challenge
criticism
of
it
at
this
date
in
the
light
of
all
our
present
experience
it
is
in
twelve
sections
and
you
will
find
in
it
the
very
proposition
which
is
now
in
question
being
the
requirement
of
equal
rights
for
all
in
the
reconstruction
of
the
rebel
states
be
it
further
that
the
that
is
the
delegates
to
the
convention
for
the
reëstablishment
of
a
state
government
be
elected
by
loyal
male
of
the
united
states
of
the
age
of
years
and
resident
at
the
time
in
the
county
parish
or
district
in
which
they
shall
offer
to
vote
and
enrolled
as
aforesaid
or
absent
in
the
military
service
of
the
united
and
then
the
bill
proceeds
to
provide
that
the
convention
shall
declare
on
behalf
of
the
people
of
the
state
their
submission
to
the
constitution
and
laws
of
the
united
states
and
shall
adopt
the
following
provisions
hereby
prescribed
by
the
united
states
in
the
execution
of
the
constitutional
duty
to
guaranty
a
republican
form
of
government
to
every
state
and
incorporate
them
in
the
constitution
of
the
state
that
is
to
say
after
one
two
three
four
provisions
the
section
proceeds
as
follows
there
shall
be
no
distinction
among
the
inhabitants
of
this
state
founded
on
race
former
condition
or
color
every
such
inhabitant
shall
be
entitled
to
all
the
privileges
before
the
law
enjoyed
by
the
most
favored
class
of
such
and
the
section
concludes
these
provisions
shall
be
perpetual
not
to
be
abolished
or
changed
nor
is
this
all
on
the
same
day
i
introduced
bill
supplying
appropriate
legislation
to
enforce
the
amendment
to
the
constitution
prohibiting
slavery
of
which
i
will
read
the
third
section
in
further
enforcement
of
the
provision
of
the
constitution
prohibiting
slavery
and
in
order
to
remove
all
relics
of
this
wrong
from
the
states
where
this
constitutional
prohibition
takes
effect
it
is
hereby
declared
that
all
laws
or
customs
in
such
states
establishing
any
oligarchical
privileges
and
any
distinction
of
rights
on
account
of
race
or
color
are
hereby
annulled
all
persons
in
such
states
are
recognized
as
equal
before
the
and
the
penalties
provided
in
the
last
section
are
hereby
made
applicable
to
any
violation
of
this
provision
which
is
made
in
pursuance
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
still
further
on
the
same
day
i
introduced
declaratory
of
the
duty
of
congress
in
respect
to
guaranties
of
the
national
security
and
the
national
faith
in
the
rebel
one
of
these
guaranties
which
i
proposed
to
establish
was
as
follows
complete
suppression
of
all
oligarchical
pretensions
and
the
complete
enfranchisement
of
all
citizens
that
there
shall
be
no
denial
of
rights
on
account
of
color
or
but
justice
shall
be
impartial
and
all
shall
be
equal
before
the
i
added
also
a
provision
which
i
was
unable
to
carry
it
was
lost
by
a
tie
vote
as
follows
organization
of
an
educational
system
for
the
equal
benefit
of
all
without
distinction
of
color
or
such
sir
were
the
measures
which
i
had
the
honor
of
bringing
forward
at
the
very
beginning
of
the
session
during
the
same
session
in
an
elaborate
effort
which
occupied
two
days
february
and
and
is
entitled
equal
rights
of
all
the
great
guaranty
and
present
necessity
for
the
sake
of
security
and
to
maintain
a
republican
government
i
vindicated
the
necessity
of
the
colored
suffrage
in
order
to
obtain
peace
and
reconciliation
and
i
placed
it
on
the
foundations
of
constitutional
law
as
well
as
natural
justice
here
is
a
passage
from
this
speech
here
after
this
long
review
i
am
brought
back
to
more
general
considerations
and
end
as
i
began
by
showing
the
necessity
of
enfranchisement
for
the
sake
of
public
security
and
public
faith
i
plead
now
for
the
ballot
as
the
great
guaranty
and
only
sufficient
being
in
itself
peacemaker
reconciler
schoolmaster
and
protector
to
which
we
are
bound
by
every
necessity
and
every
reason
and
i
speak
also
for
the
good
of
the
states
lately
in
rebellion
as
well
as
for
the
glory
and
safety
of
the
republic
that
it
may
be
an
example
to
the
speech
closed
as
follows
roman
cato
after
declaring
his
belief
in
the
immortality
of
the
soul
added
that
if
this
were
an
error
it
was
an
error
he
loved
and
now
declaring
my
belief
in
liberty
and
equality
as
the
birthright
of
all
men
let
me
say
in
the
same
spirit
if
this
be
an
error
it
is
an
error
i
love
if
this
be
a
fault
it
is
a
fault
i
shall
be
slow
to
renounce
if
this
be
an
illusion
it
is
an
illusion
which
i
pray
may
wrap
the
world
in
its
angelic
the
discussion
still
proceeded
and
only
a
month
later
march
i
made
another
elaborate
effort
with
the
same
object
from
which
i
read
my
constant
testimony
do
not
stop
to
exhibit
the
elective
franchise
as
essential
to
the
security
of
the
freedman
without
which
he
will
be
the
prey
of
slavery
in
some
new
form
and
can
not
rise
to
the
stature
of
manhood
in
opening
this
debate
i
presented
the
argument
fully
suffice
it
to
say
that
emancipation
will
fail
in
beneficence
if
you
do
not
assure
to
the
former
slave
all
the
rights
of
the
citizen
until
you
do
this
your
work
will
be
only
and
the
freedman
only
a
this
speech
closed
as
follows
the
precious
words
of
the
early
english
writer
who
describing
good
tells
us
that
he
the
image
of
god
nevertheless
his
image
cut
in
ebony
as
if
done
in
the
good
statesman
must
be
like
the
good
his
ship
is
the
state
which
he
keeps
safe
on
its
track
he
too
must
see
the
image
of
god
in
all
his
and
in
the
discharge
of
his
responsible
duties
must
set
his
face
forever
against
any
recognition
of
inequality
in
human
rights
other
things
you
may
do
but
this
you
must
not
i
do
not
quote
other
efforts
other
speeches
but
pass
to
the
next
session
of
congress
when
at
the
beginning
under
date
of
december
i
introduced
resolutions
thus
entitled
declaring
the
true
principles
of
reconstruction
the
jurisdiction
of
congress
over
the
whole
subject
the
illegality
of
existing
governments
in
the
rebel
states
and
the
exclusion
of
such
states
with
such
illegal
governments
from
representation
in
congress
and
from
voting
on
constitutional
of
these
resolutions
the
fourth
is
as
follows
in
determining
what
is
a
republican
form
of
government
congress
must
follow
implicitly
the
definition
supplied
by
the
declaration
of
independence
and
in
the
practical
application
of
this
definition
it
must
after
excluding
all
disloyal
persons
take
care
new
governments
are
founded
on
the
two
fundamental
truths
therein
contained
first
that
all
men
are
equal
in
rights
and
secondly
that
all
just
government
stands
only
on
the
consent
of
the
meanwhile
the
subject
of
reconstruction
was
practically
discussed
in
both
houses
of
congress
in
this
chamber
a
bill
was
introduced
by
the
senator
from
oregon
williams
providing
a
military
government
in
the
house
there
was
another
bill
and
on
that
bill
good
representatives
to
whom
be
all
honor
sought
to
ingraft
the
requirement
of
colored
suffrage
this
effort
unhappily
did
not
prevail
the
bill
came
to
this
chamber
without
it
in
this
chamber
the
same
effort
was
made
but
the
bill
while
it
was
still
immatured
passed
into
our
caucus
the
effort
which
had
thus
far
failed
was
then
renewed
by
me
in
the
committee
where
it
again
failed
it
was
then
renewed
by
me
in
the
caucus
where
it
triumphed
this
is
the
history
of
that
proposition
i
claim
nothing
for
myself
i
alluded
to
it
the
other
day
only
in
direct
reply
to
the
arraignment
of
the
senator
from
illinois
i
allude
to
it
now
reluctantly
and
only
in
direct
reply
to
the
arraignment
of
the
senator
from
nevada
i
regret
to
be
obliged
to
make
any
allusion
to
it
i
think
there
is
no
occasion
for
any
i
have
erred
perhaps
in
taking
so
much
time
in
this
explanation
but
when
the
senator
after
days
and
weeks
of
interval
came
here
with
his
second
indictment
i
felt
that
i
might
without
impropriety
throw
myself
upon
the
indulgence
of
this
chamber
to
make
the
simple
explanation
that
i
have
made
i
have
shown
that
as
early
as
february
i
proposed
in
this
chamber
to
require
the
colored
suffrage
as
the
of
reconstruction
i
have
shown
that
in
an
elaborate
bill
introduced
december
being
a
bill
of
reconstruction
i
required
the
very
things
which
were
afterward
introduced
in
the
reconstruction
act
of
and
i
have
shown
also
that
here
in
this
chamber
at
home
among
my
constituents
in
direct
intercourse
with
the
president
and
also
in
communication
with
colored
persons
at
the
south
from
the
beginning
i
insisted
upon
the
colored
suffrage
as
the
essential
condition
of
reconstruction
it
so
happened
that
i
was
a
member
of
the
committee
appointed
by
the
caucus
to
consider
this
question
giving
me
the
opportunity
there
of
moving
it
again
and
then
i
had
another
opportunity
in
the
caucus
of
renewing
the
effort
i
did
renew
it
and
thank
god
it
was
successful
had
bingham
or
blaine
who
made
a
kindred
effort
in
the
house
been
of
our
committee
and
then
of
our
caucus
i
do
not
doubt
they
would
have
done
the
same
thing
my
colleague
did
not
use
too
strong
language
when
he
said
that
then
and
there
in
that
small
room
in
that
caucus
was
decided
the
greatest
pending
question
on
the
north
american
continent
i
remember
his
delight
his
ecstasy
at
the
result
i
remember
other
language
that
he
employed
on
that
occasion
which
i
do
not
quote
i
know
he
was
elevated
by
the
triumph
and
yet
it
was
carried
only
by
two
votes
there
are
senators
who
were
present
at
that
caucus
according
to
whose
recollection
it
was
carried
only
by
one
vote
the
in
conversing
with
me
on
this
subject
lately
told
me
that
he
had
often
in
addressing
his
constituents
alluded
to
this
result
as
illustrating
the
importance
of
one
vote
in
deciding
a
great
question
the
was
in
error
it
was
not
by
one
vote
but
by
two
votes
that
it
was
carried
sherman
of
ohio
following
with
personal
recollections
concerning
the
provision
for
colored
suffrage
in
the
reconstruction
act
of
said
it
was
his
that
the
motion
for
its
adoption
was
made
by
colleague
wilson
undoubtedly
the
other
senator
from
massachusetts
sumner
made
it
in
committee
and
advocated
it
adding
however
the
senator
from
massachusetts
nor
any
other
senator
can
claim
any
great
merit
in
voting
for
universal
suffrage
in
february
or
march
his
record
was
made
long
before
in
reference
to
the
latter
sherman
remarked
senator
from
massachusetts
needs
no
defender
of
his
course
on
the
question
of
universal
suffrage
no
man
can
deny
that
from
the
first
and
i
think
the
very
first
he
has
advocated
and
maintained
the
necessity
of
giving
to
the
colored
people
of
the
southern
states
the
right
to
early
and
late
he
has
repeated
to
us
the
necessity
of
conferring
suffrage
upon
the
colored
people
of
the
south
as
the
basis
of
reconstruction
i
think
therefore
that
he
is
justified
in
stating
that
he
was
the
first
to
propose
it
in
this
body
and
why
should
the
senator
deem
it
necessary
to
spend
one
hour
of
our
valuable
time
now
to
prove
this
fact
in
my
judgment
it
would
be
just
as
well
for
george
washington
to
defend
himself
against
the
charge
of
disloyalty
to
the
american
colonies
for
whom
he
was
fighting
as
for
the
honorable
senator
to
defend
his
record
on
this
after
further
remarks
by
stewart
and
trumbull
of
the
same
character
as
the
first
wilson
rose
and
addressed
the
chair
but
a
previous
motion
for
adjournment
being
insisted
upon
and
prevailing
he
was
cut
off
and
the
matter
subsided
