lincoln
first
inaugural
address
march
fellow
citizens
of
the
united
states
in
compliance
with
a
custom
as
old
as
the
government
itself
i
appear
before
you
to
address
you
briefly
and
to
take
in
your
presence
the
oath
prescribed
by
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
to
be
taken
by
the
president
before
he
enters
on
the
execution
of
his
office
i
do
not
consider
it
necessary
at
present
for
me
to
discuss
those
matters
of
administration
about
which
there
is
no
special
anxiety
or
excitement
apprehension
seems
to
exist
among
the
people
of
the
southern
states
that
by
the
accession
of
a
republican
administration
their
property
and
their
peace
and
personal
security
are
to
be
endangered
there
has
never
been
any
reasonable
cause
for
such
apprehension
indeed
the
most
ample
evidence
to
the
contrary
has
all
the
while
existed
and
been
open
to
their
inspection
it
is
found
in
nearly
all
the
published
speeches
of
him
who
now
addresses
you
i
do
but
quote
from
one
of
those
speeches
when
i
declare
that
i
have
no
purpose
directly
or
indirectly
to
interfere
with
the
institution
of
slavery
in
the
states
where
it
exists
i
believe
i
have
no
lawful
right
to
do
so
and
i
have
no
inclination
to
do
so
those
who
nominated
and
elected
me
did
so
with
full
knowledge
that
i
had
made
this
and
many
similar
declarations
and
had
never
recanted
them
and
more
than
this
they
placed
in
the
platform
for
my
acceptance
and
as
a
law
to
themselves
and
to
me
the
clear
and
emphatic
resolution
which
i
now
read
resolved
that
the
maintenance
inviolate
of
the
rights
of
the
states
and
especially
the
right
of
each
state
to
order
and
control
its
own
domestic
institutions
according
to
its
own
judgment
exclusively
is
essential
to
that
balance
of
power
on
which
the
perfection
and
endurance
of
our
political
fabric
depend
and
we
denounce
the
lawless
invasion
by
armed
force
of
the
soil
of
any
state
or
territory
no
matter
under
what
pretext
as
among
the
gravest
of
crimes
i
now
reiterate
these
sentiments
and
in
doing
so
i
only
press
upon
the
public
attention
the
most
conclusive
evidence
of
which
the
case
is
susceptible
that
the
property
peace
and
security
of
no
section
are
to
be
in
any
wise
endangered
by
the
now
incoming
administration
i
add
too
that
all
the
protection
which
consistently
with
the
constitution
and
the
laws
can
be
given
will
be
cheerfully
given
to
all
the
states
when
lawfully
demanded
for
whatever
cause
as
cheerfully
to
one
section
as
to
another
there
is
much
controversy
about
the
delivering
up
of
fugitives
from
service
or
labor
the
clause
i
now
read
is
as
plainly
written
in
the
constitution
as
any
other
of
its
provisions
no
person
held
to
service
or
labor
in
one
state
under
the
laws
thereof
escaping
into
another
shall
in
consequence
of
any
law
or
regulation
therein
be
discharged
from
such
service
or
labor
but
shall
be
delivered
up
on
claim
of
the
party
to
whom
such
service
or
labor
may
be
due
it
is
scarcely
questioned
that
this
provision
was
intended
by
those
who
made
it
for
the
reclaiming
of
what
we
call
fugitive
slaves
and
the
intention
of
the
lawgiver
is
the
law
all
members
of
congress
swear
their
support
to
the
whole
constitution
to
this
provision
as
much
as
to
any
other
to
the
proposition
then
that
slaves
whose
cases
come
within
the
terms
of
this
clause
shall
be
delivered
up
their
oaths
are
unanimous
now
if
they
would
make
the
effort
in
good
temper
could
they
not
with
nearly
equal
unanimity
frame
and
pass
a
law
by
means
of
which
to
keep
good
that
unanimous
oath
there
is
some
difference
of
opinion
whether
this
clause
should
be
enforced
by
national
or
by
state
authority
but
surely
that
difference
is
not
a
very
material
one
if
the
slave
is
to
be
surrendered
it
can
be
of
but
little
consequence
to
him
or
to
others
by
which
authority
it
is
done
and
should
any
one
in
any
case
be
content
that
his
oath
shall
go
unkept
on
a
merely
unsubstantial
controversy
as
to
how
it
shall
be
kept
again
in
any
law
upon
this
subject
ought
not
all
the
safeguards
of
liberty
known
in
civilized
and
humane
jurisprudence
to
be
introduced
so
that
a
free
man
be
not
in
any
case
surrendered
as
a
slave
and
might
it
not
be
well
at
the
same
time
to
provide
by
law
for
the
enforcement
of
that
clause
in
the
constitution
which
guarantees
that
the
citizen
of
each
state
shall
be
entitled
to
all
privileges
and
immunities
of
citizens
in
the
several
states
i
take
the
official
oath
today
with
no
mental
reservations
and
with
no
purpose
to
construe
the
constitution
or
laws
by
any
hypercritical
rules
and
while
i
do
not
choose
now
to
specify
particular
acts
of
congress
as
proper
to
be
enforced
i
do
suggest
that
it
will
be
much
safer
for
all
both
in
official
and
private
stations
to
conform
to
and
abide
by
all
those
acts
which
stand
unrepealed
than
to
violate
any
of
them
trusting
to
find
impunity
in
having
them
held
to
be
unconstitutional
it
is
years
since
the
first
inauguration
of
a
president
under
our
national
constitution
during
that
period
fifteen
different
and
greatly
distinguished
citizens
have
in
succession
administered
the
executive
branch
of
the
government
they
have
conducted
it
through
many
perils
and
generally
with
great
success
yet
with
all
this
scope
of
precedent
i
now
enter
upon
the
same
task
for
the
brief
constitutional
term
of
four
years
under
great
and
peculiar
difficulty
a
disruption
of
the
federal
union
heretofore
only
menaced
is
now
formidably
attempted
i
hold
that
in
contemplation
of
universal
law
and
of
the
constitution
the
union
of
these
states
is
perpetual
perpetuity
is
implied
if
not
expressed
in
the
fundamental
law
of
all
national
governments
it
is
safe
to
assert
that
no
government
proper
ever
had
a
provision
in
its
organic
law
for
its
own
termination
continue
to
execute
all
the
express
provisions
of
our
national
constitution
and
the
union
will
endure
forever
it
being
impossible
to
destroy
it
except
by
some
action
not
provided
for
in
the
instrument
itself
again
if
the
united
states
be
not
a
government
proper
but
an
association
of
states
in
the
nature
of
contract
merely
can
it
as
a
contract
be
peaceably
unmade
by
less
than
all
the
parties
who
made
it
one
party
to
a
contract
may
violate
it
break
it
so
to
speak
but
does
it
not
require
all
to
lawfully
rescind
it
descending
from
these
general
principles
we
find
the
proposition
that
in
legal
contemplation
the
union
is
perpetual
confirmed
by
the
history
of
the
union
itself
the
union
is
much
older
than
the
constitution
it
was
formed
in
fact
by
the
articles
of
association
in
it
was
matured
and
continued
by
the
declaration
of
independence
in
it
was
further
matured
and
the
faith
of
all
the
then
thirteen
states
expressly
plighted
and
engaged
that
it
should
be
perpetual
by
the
articles
of
confederation
in
and
finally
in
one
of
the
declared
objects
for
ordaining
and
establishing
the
constitution
was
to
form
a
more
perfect
union
but
if
the
destruction
of
the
union
by
one
or
by
a
part
only
of
the
states
be
lawfully
possible
the
union
is
less
perfect
than
before
the
constitution
having
lost
the
vital
element
of
perpetuity
it
follows
from
these
views
that
no
state
upon
its
own
mere
motion
can
lawfully
get
out
of
the
union
that
resolves
and
ordinances
to
that
effect
are
legally
void
and
that
acts
of
violence
within
any
state
or
states
against
the
authority
of
the
united
states
are
insurrectionary
or
revolutionary
according
to
circumstances
i
therefore
consider
that
in
view
of
the
constitution
and
the
laws
the
union
is
unbroken
and
to
the
extent
of
my
ability
i
shall
take
care
as
the
constitution
itself
expressly
enjoins
upon
me
that
the
laws
of
the
union
be
faithfully
executed
in
all
the
states
doing
this
i
deem
to
be
only
a
simple
duty
on
my
part
and
i
shall
perform
it
so
far
as
practicable
unless
my
rightful
masters
the
american
people
shall
withhold
the
requisite
means
or
in
some
authoritative
manner
direct
the
contrary
i
trust
this
will
not
be
regarded
as
a
menace
but
only
as
the
declared
purpose
of
the
union
that
it
will
constitutionally
defend
and
maintain
itself
in
doing
this
there
needs
to
be
no
bloodshed
or
violence
and
there
shall
be
none
unless
it
be
forced
upon
the
national
authority
the
power
confided
to
me
will
be
used
to
hold
occupy
and
possess
the
property
and
places
belonging
to
the
government
and
to
collect
the
duties
and
imposts
but
beyond
what
may
be
necessary
for
these
objects
there
will
be
no
invasion
no
using
of
force
against
or
among
the
people
anywhere
where
hostility
to
the
united
states
in
any
interior
locality
shall
be
so
great
and
universal
as
to
prevent
competent
resident
citizens
from
holding
the
federal
offices
there
will
be
no
attempt
to
force
obnoxious
strangers
among
the
people
for
that
object
while
the
strict
legal
right
may
exist
in
the
government
to
enforce
the
exercise
of
these
offices
the
attempt
to
do
so
would
be
so
irritating
and
so
nearly
impracticable
withal
that
i
deem
it
better
to
forego
for
the
time
the
uses
of
such
offices
the
mails
unless
repelled
will
continue
to
be
furnished
in
all
parts
of
the
union
so
far
as
possible
the
people
everywhere
shall
have
that
sense
of
perfect
security
which
is
most
favorable
to
calm
thought
and
reflection
the
course
here
indicated
will
be
followed
unless
current
events
and
experience
shall
show
a
modification
or
change
to
be
proper
and
in
every
case
and
exigency
my
best
discretion
will
be
exercised
according
to
circumstances
actually
existing
and
with
a
view
and
a
hope
of
a
peaceful
solution
of
the
national
troubles
and
the
restoration
of
fraternal
sympathies
and
affections
that
there
are
persons
in
one
section
or
another
who
seek
to
destroy
the
union
at
all
events
and
are
glad
of
any
pretext
to
do
it
i
will
neither
affirm
nor
deny
but
if
there
be
such
i
need
address
no
word
to
them
to
those
however
who
really
love
the
union
may
i
not
speak
before
entering
upon
so
grave
a
matter
as
the
destruction
of
our
national
fabric
with
all
its
benefits
its
memories
and
its
hopes
would
it
not
be
wise
to
ascertain
precisely
why
we
do
it
will
you
hazard
so
desperate
a
step
while
there
is
any
possibility
that
any
portion
of
the
ills
you
fly
from
have
no
real
existence
will
you
while
the
certain
ills
you
fly
to
are
greater
than
all
the
real
ones
you
fly
from
will
you
risk
the
commission
of
so
fearful
a
mistake
all
profess
to
be
content
in
the
union
if
all
constitutional
rights
can
be
maintained
is
it
true
then
that
any
right
plainly
written
in
the
constitution
has
been
denied
i
think
not
happily
the
human
mind
is
so
constituted
that
no
party
can
reach
to
the
audacity
of
doing
this
think
if
you
can
of
a
single
instance
in
which
a
plainly
written
provision
of
the
constitution
has
ever
been
denied
if
by
the
mere
force
of
numbers
a
majority
should
deprive
a
minority
of
any
clearly
written
constitutional
right
it
might
in
a
moral
point
of
view
justify
revolution
certainly
would
if
such
a
right
were
a
vital
one
but
such
is
not
our
case
all
the
vital
rights
of
minorities
and
of
individuals
are
so
plainly
assured
to
them
by
affirmations
and
negations
guaranties
and
prohibitions
in
the
constitution
that
controversies
never
arise
concerning
them
but
no
organic
law
can
ever
be
framed
with
a
provision
specifically
applicable
to
every
question
which
may
occur
in
practical
administration
no
foresight
can
anticipate
nor
any
document
of
reasonable
length
contain
express
provisions
for
all
possible
questions
shall
fugitives
from
labor
be
surrendered
by
national
or
state
authority
the
constitution
does
not
expressly
say
may
congress
prohibit
slavery
in
the
territories
the
constitution
does
not
expressly
say
must
congress
protect
slavery
in
the
territories
the
constitution
does
not
expressly
say
from
questions
of
this
class
spring
all
our
constitutional
controversies
and
we
divide
upon
them
into
majorities
and
minorities
if
the
minority
will
not
acquiesce
the
majority
must
or
the
government
must
cease
there
is
no
other
alternative
for
continuing
the
government
is
acquiescence
on
one
side
or
the
other
if
a
minority
in
such
case
will
secede
rather
than
acquiesce
they
make
a
precedent
which
in
turn
will
divide
and
ruin
them
for
a
minority
of
their
own
will
secede
from
them
whenever
a
majority
refuses
to
be
controlled
by
such
minority
for
instance
why
may
not
any
portion
of
a
new
confederacy
a
year
or
two
hence
arbitrarily
secede
again
precisely
as
portions
of
the
present
union
now
claim
to
secede
from
it
all
who
cherish
disunion
sentiments
are
now
being
educated
to
the
exact
temper
of
doing
this
is
there
such
perfect
identity
of
interests
among
the
states
to
compose
a
new
union
as
to
produce
harmony
only
and
prevent
renewed
secession
plainly
the
central
idea
of
secession
is
the
essence
of
anarchy
a
majority
held
in
restraint
by
constitutional
checks
and
limitations
and
always
changing
easily
with
deliberate
changes
of
popular
opinions
and
sentiments
is
the
only
true
sovereign
of
a
free
people
whoever
rejects
it
does
of
necessity
fly
to
anarchy
or
to
despotism
unanimity
is
impossible
the
rule
of
a
minority
as
a
permanent
arrangement
is
wholly
inadmissible
so
that
rejecting
the
majority
principle
anarchy
or
despotism
in
some
form
is
all
that
is
left
i
do
not
forget
the
position
assumed
by
some
that
constitutional
questions
are
to
be
decided
by
the
supreme
court
nor
do
i
deny
that
such
decisions
must
be
binding
in
any
case
upon
the
parties
to
a
suit
as
to
the
object
of
that
suit
while
they
are
also
entitled
to
very
high
respect
and
consideration
in
all
parallel
cases
by
all
other
departments
of
the
government
and
while
it
is
obviously
possible
that
such
decision
may
be
erroneous
in
any
given
case
still
the
evil
effect
following
it
being
limited
to
that
particular
case
with
the
chance
that
it
may
be
overruled
and
never
become
a
precedent
for
other
cases
can
better
be
borne
than
could
the
evils
of
a
different
practice
at
the
same
time
the
candid
citizen
must
confess
that
if
the
policy
of
the
government
upon
vital
questions
affecting
the
whole
people
is
to
be
irrevocably
fixed
by
decisions
of
the
supreme
court
the
instant
they
are
made
in
ordinary
litigation
between
parties
in
personal
actions
the
people
will
have
ceased
to
be
their
own
rulers
having
to
that
extent
practically
resigned
their
government
into
the
hands
of
that
eminent
tribunal
nor
is
there
in
this
view
any
assault
upon
the
court
or
the
judges
it
is
a
duty
from
which
they
may
not
shrink
to
decide
cases
properly
brought
before
them
and
it
is
no
fault
of
theirs
if
others
seek
to
turn
their
decisions
to
political
purposes
one
section
of
our
country
believes
slavery
is
right
and
ought
to
be
extended
while
the
other
believes
it
is
wrong
and
ought
not
to
be
extended
this
is
the
only
substantial
dispute
the
clause
of
the
constitution
and
the
law
for
the
suppression
of
the
foreign
are
each
as
well
enforced
perhaps
as
any
law
can
ever
be
in
a
community
where
the
moral
sense
of
the
people
imperfectly
supports
the
law
itself
the
great
body
of
the
people
abide
by
the
dry
legal
obligation
in
both
cases
and
a
few
break
over
in
each
this
i
think
can
not
be
perfectly
cured
and
it
would
be
worse
in
both
cases
after
the
separation
of
the
sections
than
before
the
foreign
now
imperfectly
suppressed
would
be
ultimately
revived
without
restriction
in
one
section
while
fugitive
slaves
now
only
partially
surrendered
would
not
be
surrendered
at
all
by
the
other
physically
speaking
we
can
not
separate
we
can
not
remove
our
respective
sections
from
each
other
nor
build
an
impassable
wall
between
them
a
husband
and
wife
may
be
divorced
and
go
out
of
the
presence
and
beyond
the
reach
of
each
other
but
the
different
parts
of
our
country
can
not
do
this
they
can
not
but
remain
face
to
face
and
intercourse
either
amicable
or
hostile
must
continue
between
them
is
it
possible
then
to
make
that
intercourse
more
advantageous
or
more
satisfactory
after
separation
than
before
can
aliens
make
treaties
easier
than
friends
can
make
laws
can
treaties
be
more
faithfully
enforced
between
aliens
than
laws
can
among
friends
suppose
you
go
to
war
you
can
not
fight
always
and
when
after
much
loss
on
both
sides
an
no
gain
on
either
you
cease
fighting
the
identical
old
questions
as
to
terms
of
intercourse
are
again
upon
you
this
country
with
its
institutions
belongs
to
the
people
who
inhabit
it
whenever
they
shall
grow
weary
of
the
existing
government
they
can
exercise
their
constitutional
right
of
amending
it
or
their
revolutionary
right
to
dismember
or
overthrow
it
i
can
not
be
ignorant
of
the
fact
that
many
worthy
and
patriotic
citizens
are
desirous
of
having
the
national
constitution
amended
while
i
make
no
recommendation
of
amendments
i
fully
recognize
the
rightful
authority
of
the
people
over
the
whole
subject
to
be
exercised
in
either
of
the
modes
prescribed
in
the
instrument
itself
and
i
should
under
existing
circumstances
favor
rather
than
oppose
a
fair
opportunity
being
afforded
the
people
to
act
upon
it
i
will
venture
to
add
that
to
me
the
convention
mode
seems
preferable
in
that
it
allows
amendments
to
originate
with
the
people
themselves
instead
of
only
permitting
them
to
take
or
reject
propositions
originated
by
others
not
especially
chosen
for
the
purpose
and
which
might
not
be
precisely
such
as
they
would
wish
to
either
accept
or
refuse
i
understand
a
proposed
amendment
to
the
constitution
which
amendment
however
i
have
not
seen
has
passed
congress
to
the
effect
that
the
federal
government
shall
never
interfere
with
the
domestic
institutions
of
the
states
including
that
of
persons
held
to
service
to
avoid
misconstruction
of
what
i
have
said
i
depart
from
my
purpose
not
to
speak
of
particular
amendments
so
far
as
to
say
that
holding
such
a
provision
to
now
be
implied
constitutional
law
i
have
no
objection
to
its
being
made
express
and
irrevocable
the
chief
magistrate
derives
all
his
authority
from
the
people
and
they
have
conferred
none
upon
him
to
fix
terms
for
the
separation
of
the
states
the
people
themselves
can
do
this
also
if
they
choose
but
the
executive
as
such
has
nothing
to
do
with
it
his
duty
is
to
administer
the
present
government
as
it
came
to
his
hands
and
to
transmit
it
unimpaired
by
him
to
his
successor
why
should
there
not
be
a
patient
confidence
in
the
ultimate
justice
of
the
people
is
there
any
better
or
equal
hope
in
the
world
in
our
present
differences
is
either
party
without
faith
of
being
in
the
right
if
the
almighty
ruler
of
nations
with
his
eternal
truth
and
justice
be
on
your
side
of
the
north
or
on
yours
of
the
south
that
truth
and
that
justice
will
surely
prevail
by
the
judgment
of
this
great
tribunal
the
american
people
by
the
frame
of
the
government
under
which
we
live
this
same
people
have
wisely
given
their
public
servants
but
little
power
for
mischief
and
have
with
equal
wisdom
provided
for
the
return
of
that
little
to
their
own
hands
at
very
short
intervals
while
the
people
retain
their
virtue
and
vigilance
no
administration
by
any
extreme
of
wickedness
or
folly
can
very
seriously
injure
the
government
in
the
short
space
of
four
years
my
countrymen
one
and
all
think
calmly
and
well
upon
this
whole
subject
nothing
valuable
can
be
lost
by
taking
time
if
there
be
an
object
to
hurry
any
of
you
in
hot
haste
to
a
step
which
you
would
never
take
deliberately
that
object
will
be
frustrated
by
taking
time
but
no
good
object
can
be
frustrated
by
it
such
of
you
as
are
now
dissatisfied
still
have
the
old
constitution
unimpaired
and
on
the
sensitive
point
the
laws
of
your
own
framing
under
it
while
the
new
administration
will
have
no
immediate
power
if
it
would
to
change
either
if
it
were
admitted
that
you
who
are
dissatisfied
hold
the
right
side
in
the
dispute
there
still
is
no
single
good
reason
for
precipitate
action
intelligence
patriotism
christianity
and
a
firm
reliance
on
him
who
has
never
yet
forsaken
this
favored
land
are
still
competent
to
adjust
in
the
best
way
all
our
present
difficulty
in
your
hands
my
dissatisfied
and
not
in
mine
is
the
momentous
issue
of
civil
war
the
government
will
not
assail
you
you
can
have
no
conflict
without
being
yourselves
the
aggressors
you
have
no
oath
registered
in
heaven
to
destroy
the
government
while
shall
have
the
most
solemn
one
to
preserve
protect
and
defend
it
i
am
loathe
to
close
we
are
not
enemies
but
friends
we
must
not
be
enemies
though
passion
may
have
strained
it
must
not
break
our
bonds
of
affection
the
mystic
chords
of
memory
stretching
from
every
battlefield
and
patriot
grave
to
every
living
heart
and
hearthstone
all
over
this
broad
land
will
yet
swell
the
chorus
of
the
union
when
again
touched
as
surely
they
will
be
by
the
better
angels
of
our
nature
