documents
preface
it
is
with
great
pleasure
that
i
include
in
this
volume
contemporary
hudson
documents
which
have
remained
neglected
for
three
centuries
and
here
are
published
for
the
first
time
as
i
explain
more
fully
elsewhere
their
discovery
is
due
to
the
painstaking
research
of
marsden
my
humble
share
in
the
matter
has
been
to
recognize
the
importance
of
discovery
and
to
direct
the
particular
search
in
the
record
office
in
london
that
has
resulted
in
their
present
reproduction
i
regret
that
they
are
inconclusive
we
still
are
ignorant
of
what
punishment
was
inflicted
upon
the
mutineers
of
the
discovery
or
even
if
they
were
punished
at
all
the
primary
importance
of
these
documents
however
is
not
that
they
establish
the
fact
until
now
not
established
that
the
mutineers
were
brought
to
trial
it
is
that
they
embody
the
sworn
testimony
hitherto
unproduced
of
six
members
of
hudson
crew
concerning
the
mutiny
asher
the
most
authoritative
of
modern
historians
wrote
prickett
is
the
only
that
has
left
us
an
account
of
these
events
and
we
can
therefore
not
correct
his
statements
whether
they
be
true
or
false
we
now
have
the
accounts
of
five
additional
prickett
himself
is
one
of
the
six
whose
testimony
has
been
recovered
and
all
of
them
so
far
as
they
go
substantially
are
in
accord
with
prickett
account
such
agreement
is
not
proof
of
truth
the
newly
adduced
witnesses
and
the
earlier
single
witness
equally
were
interested
in
making
out
a
case
in
their
own
favor
that
would
save
them
from
being
hanged
but
this
new
evidence
does
entitle
prickett
larger
discourse
to
a
more
respectful
consideration
than
that
dubious
document
heretofore
has
received
save
in
matters
affected
by
this
fresh
material
the
following
narrative
is
a
condensation
of

no
portrait
of

is
known
to
be
in

what
has
passed
with
the
uncritical
for
his
portrait
a
man
wearing
a
ruffed
collar
frequently
has
been
and
continues
to
be
reproduced
who
that
man
was
is
unknown
that
he
was
not
hudson
is
certain
lacking
hudson
portrait
i
have
used
for
a
frontispiece
a
photograph
especially
taken
for
this
purpose
of
the
interior
of
the

of

ethelburga
the
sole
remaining
material

of
which
we
have

knowledge
between

represents
what
is
very
near
to
being
another

link

replica
lately
built
in
holland
of
the
half
moon
the
ship
in
which
hudson
made
his
most
famous
voyage
the
other
illustrations
have
been
selected
with
a
strict
regard
to
the
meaning
of
that
word
in
order
to
throw
light
on
the
text
i
have
preferred
to
the
ventures
of
fancy
reproductions
of
of
works
on
navigation
that
hudson
probably
used
pictures
of
the
few
and
crude
instruments
of
navigation
that
he
certainly
used
and
pictures
of
ships
virtually
identical
with
those
in
which
he
sailed
the
copy
of
wright
famous
work
on
navigation
that
hudson
may
have
had
and
probably
did
have
with
him
was
of
an
earlier
date
than
that
of
which
the
here
is
reproduced
this
reproduction
is
of
interest
in
that
it
shows
at
a
glance
all
of
the
nautical
instruments
that
hudson
had
at
his
command
and
of
a
still
greater
interest
in
that
the
map
which
is
a
part
of
it
exhibits
what
at
that
time
by
exploration
or
by
conjecture
was
the
known
world
to
the
making
of
that
map
hudson
himself
contributed
on
it
with
a
previously
unknown
assurance
his
river
clearly
is
marked
the
inadequate
indication
of
his
bay
probably
is
taken
from
weymouth
chart
the
chart
that
hudson
had
with
him
on
his
voyage
a
curious
feature
of
this
map
is
its
marking
in
defiance
of
known
facts
of
two
straits
to
the
north
and
to
the
south
of
a
large
island
where
should
be
the
isthmus
of
panama
the
one
seemingly
fanciful
picture
that
of
the
mermaids
is
not
fanciful
a
point
that
i
have
enlarged
upon
elsewhere
by
the
standard
of
hudson
times
hudson
himself
believed
in
the
existence
of
mermaids
as
is
proved
by
his
entry
in
his
log
that
a
mermaid
had
been
seen
by
two
of
his
crew
a
brief
life
of
henry
hudson
henry
hudson
i
if
ever
a
compelling
fate
set
its
grip
upon
a
man
and
drove
him
to
an
accomplishment
beside
his
purpose
and
outside
his
thought
it
was
when
henry
hudson
having
headed
his
ship
upon
an
ordered
course
northeastward
directly
traversed
his
orders
by
fetching
that
compass
to
the
southwestward
which
ended
by
bringing
him
into
what
now
is
hudson
river
and
which
led
on
quickly
to
the
founding
of
what
now
is
new
york
indeed
the
late
thomas
aquinas
and
the
later
calvin
could
have
made
out
from
the
few
known
facts
in
the
life
of
this
navigator
so
pretty
a
case
in
favor
of
predestination
that
the
blessed
augustine
and
the
worthy
arminius
supposing
the
four
come
together
for
a
friendly
dish
of
theological
talk
would
have
had
their
work
cut
out
for
them
to
formulate
a
countercase
in
favor
of
free
will
it
is
a
curious
truth
that
every
important
move
in
hudson
life
of
which
we
have
record
seems
to
have
been
a
forced
move
sometimes
with
a
look
of
chance
about
it
as
when
the
directors
of
the
dutch
east
india
company
called
him
back
and
hastily
renewed
with
him
their
suspended
agreement
that
he
should
search
for
a
passage
to
cathay
on
a
northeast
course
past
nova
zembla
and
so
sent
him
off
on
the
voyage
that
brought
the
half
moon
into
hudson
river
sometimes
with
the
fatalism
very
much
in
evidence
as
when
his
own
government
seized
him
out
of
the
dutch
service
and
so
put
him
in
the
way
to
go
sailing
to
his
death
on
that
voyage
through
strait
that
ended
for
him
in
his
mutineering
crew
casting
him
adrift
to
starve
with
cold
and
hunger
in
hudson
bay
and
being
dead
the
same
inconsequent
fate
that
harried
him
while
alive
has
preserved
his
name
and
very
nobly
by
anchoring
it
fast
to
that
river
and
strait
and
bay
forever
and
this
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
all
three
of
them
were
discovered
by
other
navigators
before
his
time
hudson
sought
as
from
the
time
of
columbus
downward
other
navigators
had
sought
before
him
a
short
cut
to
the
indies
but
his
search
was
made
because
of
what
those
others
had
accomplished
within
narrowed
lines
in
the
century
and
more
that
had
passed
between
the
great
admiral
death
and
the
beginning
of
explorations
one
important
geographical
fact
had
been
established
that
there
was
no
across
america
between
roughly
the
latitudes
of
south
and
north
of
necessity
therefore
since
to
round
america
south
of
south
would
make
a
longer
voyage
than
by
the
known
route

even
within
those
lessened
limits
much
had
been
determined
before
hudson
time
to
the
eastward
both
dutch
and
english
searchers
had
gone
far
along
the

passing
between
that
coast
and
nova

entering

illustration
of
of
a
sea
handbook
of
hudson
time
as
the
result
of
all
this
exploration
hudson
had
at
his
command
a
mass
of
information
positive
as
well
as
negative
that
at
once
narrowed
his
search
and
directed
it
and
there
is
very
good
reason
for
believing
that
he
actually
carried
with
him
charts
of
a
crude
sort
on
which
more
or
less
clearly
were
indicated
the
strait
and
the
bay
and
the
river
which
popularly
are
regarded
as
of
his
discovery
and
to
which
have
been
given
his
name
but
i
hold
that
his
just
fame
is
not
lessened
by
the
fact
that
his
discoveries
nominally
were
rediscoveries
within
the
proper
meaning
of
the
word
they
truly
were
his
in
that
he
did
them
so
effectually
that
they
became
known
clearly
and
thereafter
remained
known
clearly
to
the
world

of
his
full
accomplishment

and
yet
in
despite
of
this
familiarity
with

our
certain
knowledge
of
hudson
life
is
limited
to
a
period
april
of
little
more
than
four
years
of
that
period
during
which
he
did
the
work
that
has
made
him
famous
we
have
a
partial
record
much
of
it
under
his
own
hand
that
certainly
is
authentic
in
its
general
outlines
until
it
reaches
the
culminating
tragedy
at
the
very
last
where
we
most
want
the
clear
truth
we
have
only
the
account
presented
by
his
murderers
and
murderers
being
at
odds
with
moral
conventions
generally
are
not
as
a
rule

and
so
it
has
fallen
out
that
what
we
know
about
the
end
of
hudson
life
save
that
it
ended
foully
is
as
uncertain
as
the

of
the
earlier

london
general
read
thus
summarized
the
result
of
his
investigations
we
have
learned
that
london
was
the
residence
of
henry
hudson
the
elder
of
henry
hudson
his
son
and
of
christopher
hudson
and
that
captain
thomas

lived
at

now

while
thomas

the

of

resided
at

then
only
six
or
seven
miles
from
the
city
by
reference
to
a
statement
made
by
abakuk
prickett
in
his
discourse
it
will
be
found
that
henry
hudson
the
discoverer
also
was
a
citizen
of
london
and
had
a
house
there
from
all
of
which
together
with
various
minor
corroborative
facts
he
draws
these
conclusions
that
henry
hudson
the
discoverer
was
the
descendant
probably
the
grandson
of
the
henry
hudson
who
died
while
holding
the
office
of
alderman
of
the
city
of
london
in
the
year
that
he
received
his
early
training
and
imbibed
the
ideas
which
controlled
the
purposes
of
his
after
life
under
the
fostering
care
of
the
great
corporation
the
muscovy
company
which
his
relatives
had
helped
to
found
and
afterwards
to
maintain
that

in

was
advanced
to
command

is
the
net
result
of
general
read
most
laboriously
painstaking
investigations
the
facts
for
which
he
searched
so
diligently

so
longed
to
find

did
not
find

of
these

to
be
able

he
did
as
i
have
said
more
than
any
other

has
done

on
hudson

on
his

have
been
a

of
the

who
cut
so
fine
a
figure
in
the

three
centuries
and
a
half
ago
but
beyond
a
reasonable

he
was

no

could
have
told
all
that
we
so
gladly
would
know
of
hudson
early
history
but
he
did
not
tell
it
and
we
must
rest
content

think
well
content
with
that
poetic
beginning
at
the
chancel

of
ethelburga

the
strong
life
that
less
than
four
years
later
came

its
epic
ending

voyage
made
in
the
year
for
which
hudson
and
his
crew
prepared
by
making
their
peace
with
god
in
ethelburga
had
nothing
to
do
with
america
nor
did
his
voyage
of
the
year
following
have
anything
to
do
with
this
continent
both
of
those
adventures
were
set
forth
by
the
muscovy
company
in
search
of
a
northeast
passage
to
the

and
while
they
failed
in

they
added
important
facts
concerning
the
coasts
of
spitzbergen

of
nova

to
the
existing

knowledge
and
yielded

i
am
sorry
to
say
that
the
doctor
asher
in
editing
this
log
felt
called
upon
to
add
in
a
probably
a
seal
and
to
quote
in
support
of
his
prosaic
suggestion
various
unnecessary
facts
about
seals
observed
a
few
centuries
later
in
the
same
waters
by
doctor
kane
for
my
own
part
i
much
prefer
to
believe
in
the
mermaid
and
by
so
believing
to
create
in
my
own
heart
somewhat
of
the
feeling
which
was
in
the
hearts
of
those
old
seafarers
in
a
time
when
and
were
to
be
counted
with
as
among
the
perils
of
every
ocean
voyage
this
belief
of
mine
is
not
a
mere
whimsical
fancy
unless
we
take
as
real
what
the
shipmen
of
hudson
time
took
as
real
we
not
only
miss
the
strong
romance
which
was
so
large
a
part
of
their
life
but
we
go
wide
of
understanding
the
brave
spirit
in
which
their
exploring
work
was
done
adventuring
into
tempests
in
their
ships
they
took
as
a
matter
of
course
and
were
brave
in
that
way
without
any
thought
of
their
bravery
as
a
part
of
the
day
work
also
they
took
their
wretched
quarters
aboard
ship
and
their
wretched
and
usually
insufficient
food
their
highest
courage
was
reserved
for
facing
the
fearsome
dangers
which
existed
only
in
their
imaginations
but
which
were
as
real
to
them
as
were
the
dangers
of
wreck
and
of
starvation
and
of
battlings
with
wild
beasts
brute
or
human
in
strange
lands
it
followed
of
necessity
that
men
leading
lives
so
full
of
physical
hardship
and
so
beset
by
wondering
dread
were
moody
and
discontented
and
so
easily
went
on
from
sullen
anger
into
open
mutiny
and
equally
did
it
follow
that
the
shipmasters
who
held
those
surly
brutes
to
the
collar
driving
them
to
their
work
with
blows
and
now
and
then
killing
one
of
them
by
way
of
encouraging
the
others
to
obedience
were
as
absolutely
fearless
and
as
absolutely
strong
of
will
as
men
could
be
all
of
these
conditions
we
must
recognize
and
must
try
to
realize
if
we
would
understand
the
work
that
was
cut
out
for
hudson
and
for
every
master
navigator
in
that
cruel
and
harsh
and
yet
ardently
romantic
time
iv
it
is
hudson
third
voyage
the
one
that
brought
him
into
our
own
river
and
that
led
on
directly
to
the
founding
of
our
own
city
that
has
the
deepest
interest
to
us
of
new
york
he
made
it
in
the
service
of
the
dutch
east
india
company
but
how
he
came
to
enter
that
service
is
one
of
the
unsolved
problems
in
his
career
in
itself
there
was
nothing
out
of
the
common
in
those
days
in
an
english
shipmaster
going
captain
in
a
dutch
vessel
but
hudson
by
general
read
showing
was
so
strongly
backed
by
family
influence
in
the
muscovy
company
that
it
is
not
easy
to
understand
why
he
took
service
with
a
corporation
that
in
a
way
was
the
muscovy
company
trade
rival
lacking
any
explanation
of
the
matter
i
am
inclined
to
link
it
with
the
action
of
the
english
government
when
he
returned
from
his
voyage
and
made
harbor
at
dartmouth
in
detaining
him
in
england
and
in
ordering
him
to
serve
only
under
the
english
flag
and
to
infer
that
his
going
to
holland
was
the
result
of
a
falling
out
with
the
directors
of
the
muscovy
company
and
that
at
their
request
when
the
chances
of
the
sea
brought
him
within
english
jurisdiction
he
was
detained
in
his
own
country
and
so
was
put
in
the
way
to
take
up
with
the
adventure
that
led
him
straight
onward
to
his
death
in
all
of
which
may
be
seen
the
of
that
fatalism
which
to
my
mind
is
so
apparent
in
hudson
doings
and
which
is
most
apparent
in
his
third
voyage
that
evidently
had
its
origin
in
a
series
of
curious
mischances
and
that
ended
in
his
doing
precisely
what
those
who
sent
him
on
it
were
resolved
that
he
should
not
do
all
that
we
know
certainly
about
his
taking
service
with
the
dutch
company
is
told
in
a
letter
from
president
jeannin
the
french
envoy
who
was
engaged
in
the
years
with
representatives
of
other
nations
in
trying
to
patch
up
a
truce
or
a
peace
between
the
netherlands
and
spain
to
his
master
henry
iv
along
with
his
open
instructions
jeannin
seems
to
have
had
private
instructions
in
keeping
with
the
customs
and
principles
of
the
time
to
do
what
he
could
do
in
the
way
of
stealing
from
holland
for
the
benefit
of
france
a
share
of
the
east
india
trade
in
regard
to
this
amiable
phase
of
his
mission
under
date
of
january
he
wrote
some
time
ago
i
made
by
your
majesty

overtures
to
an
amsterdam
merchant
named
isaac
le
maire
a
wealthy
man
of
a
considerable
experience
in
the
east
india
trade
he
offered
to
make
himself
useful
to
your
majesty
in
matters
of
this
kind
a
few
days
ago
he
sent
to
me
his
brother
to
inform
me
that
an
english
pilot
who
has
twice
sailed
in
search
of
a
northern
passage
has
been
called
to
amsterdam
by
the
east
india
company
to
tell
them
what
he
had
found
and
whether
he
hoped
to
discover
that
passage
they
had
been
well
satisfied
with
his
answer
and
had
thought
they
might
succeed
in
the
scheme
they
had
however
been
unwilling
to
undertake
at
once
the
said
expedition
and
they
had
only
remunerated
the
englishman
for
his
trouble
and
had
dismissed
him
with
the
promise
of
employing
him
next
year
the
englishman
having
thus
obtained
his
leave
le
maire
who
knows
him
well
has
since
conferred
with
him
and
has
learnt
his
opinions
on
these
subjects
with
regard
to
which
the
englishman
had
also
intercourse
with
plancius
a
great
geographer
and
clever
mathematician
plancius
maintains
according
to
the
reasons
of
his
science
and
from
the
information
given
him
that
there
must
be
in
the
northern
parts
a
passage
corresponding
to
the
one
found
near
the
south
pole
by
magellan
the
englishman
also
reports
that
having
been
to
the
north
as
far
as
degrees
he
has
found
that
the
more
northwards
he
went
the
less
cold
it
became

hudson
name
is
not
mentioned
by
jeannin
but
as
no
other
navigator
had
been
so
far
north
as
there
can
be
no
doubt
as
to
who
the
englishman
was
the
letter
goes
on
to
urge
that
the
french
king
should
undertake
the
glorious
enterprise
of
searching
for
a
northerly
passage
to
the
indies
and
that
he
should
undertake
it
openly
as
the
east
india
company
will
not
have
even
a
right
to
complain
because
the
charter
granted
to
them
by
the
states
general
authorizes
them
to
sail
only
around
the
cape
of
good
hope
and
not
by
the
north
but
jeannin
adds
that
le
maire
does
not
dare
to
speak
about
it
to
any
one
because
the
east
india
company
fears
above
everything
to
be
forestalled
in
this
design
precisely
that
fear
on
the
part
of
the
east
india
company
did
undercut

french
envoy

in

to
his
letter
he
adds
this
letter
having
been
terminated
and
i
being
ready
to
send
it
to
your
majesty
le
maire
has
again
written
to
me
some
members
of
the
east
india
company
who
had
been
informed
that
the
englishman
had
secretly
treated
with
him
had
become
afraid
that
i
might
wish
to
employ
him
for
the
discovery
of
the
passage
for
this
reason
they
have
again
treated
with
him
about
his
undertaking
such
an
expedition
in
the
course
of
the
present
year
the
directors
of
the
amsterdam
chamber
have
written
to
the
other
chambers
of
the
same
company
to
request
their
approval
and
should
the
others
refuse
the
amsterdam
chamber
will
undertake
the
expedition
at
their
own
risk
in
point
of
fact
the
other
chambers
did
refuse
although
before
hudson
actually
sailed
they
seem
to
have
ratified
the
agreement
made
with
him
and
the
amsterdam
chamber
did
set
forth
the
voyage
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
french
project
in
a
way
was
realized
a
curiously
subtle
interest
attaches
to
jeannin
showing
of
how
narrow
were
the
chances
by
which
hudson
missed
being
taken
into
the
french
service
and
was
taken
into
that
of
the
dutch
a
french
ship
under
the
command
of
a
captain
whose
name
has
not
been
preserved
did
sail
for
the
north
almost
precisely
a
month
later
than
hudson
sailing
on
may
beyond
the
bare
fact
that
such
a
voyage
was
made
nothing
is
known
about
it
whence
the
inference
is
a
reasonable
one
that
it
produced
no
new
discoveries
but
suppose
that
hudson
had
commanded
and
so
commanding
had
not
sailed
that
unknown
captain
useless
course
but
had
brought
his
french
ship
into
what
now
are
our
bay
and
our
river
and
that
the
french
not
the
dutch
had
founded
the

now
is

those
chances

this

and
engaged
a

an

as

thereof
with

to
search
for

then
to

if
the
time
permitted
he
was
to

again
to

he
was
farther
ordered
by
his
instructions
to
think
of
discovering
no
other
route
or
passages
except
the
route
around
the
north
and

with
this
additional
proviso
that
if
it
could
not
be
accomplished
at
that
time
another
route
would
be
the
subject
of
consideration
for
another
voyage
it
is
evident
from
the
foregoing
that
never
did
a
shipmaster
get
away
to
sea
with
more
explicit
orders
than
those
which
were
given
to
hudson
as
to
how
his
voyage
was
and
as
to
how
it
was
not
to
be
made
on
his
obedience
to
those
orders
which
essentially
were
a
part
of
his
contract
depended
the
obligation
of
the

to
pay
him
for
his
services
and
farther
depended
a
consideration
that
reasonably
might
be
expected
to
touch
him
still
more
closely
their
obligation
to
bestow
a
solatium
upon
his
wife
and
children
in
the
event
of
his
death
and
yet
with
those
facts
clearly
before
him
he
did
precisely
what
he
had
contracted
and
what
in
most
express
terms
he
was
ordered
not
to
do

hudson

accompanied
by
a

vessel

good
hope
that
did
not
pursue
the
voyage
on

for
more
than
a
month
until
he
had
doubled
the
north
cape

was

then
came
the

that
made
him

or
that
gave
him
an
excuse
for
changing
his
ordered
course
the
log
that
has
been

of
this
voyage

by
robert

changed

his
abrupt

from

to

covers
the
time
in
which
the

occurred
practically
his

almost
on
the

that
the

was
changed

of

to

he
passes
over
unmentioned
the
mutiny
that
occurred
on
the
homeward
voyage
judging
him
by
the
facts
recorded
in
the
accounts
of
the
voyage
into
hudson
bay
it
is
a
fair
assumption
that
in
both
of
these
earlier
mutinies
juet
had
a
hand
i
wish
that
we
could
find
the
bond
that
held
hudson
and
juet
together
that
juet
could
write
and
that
he
understood
the
science
of
navigation
although
those
were
rare
accomplishments
among
seamen
in
his
time
fail
sufficiently
to
account
for
persistent
employment
of
him
for
my
own
part
i
revert
to
my
theory
of
fatalism
it
is
my
fancy
that
this
ancient
man
as
he
is
styled
by
one
of
his
companions
was
hudson
evil
genius
and
i
class
him
with
the
most
finely
conceived
character
in
most
finely
conceived
romance
the
pilot
schriften
in
the
phantom
ship
just
as
schriften
clung
to
the
younger
van
der
decken
to
thwart
him
so
juet
seems
to
have
clung
to
hudson
to
thwart
him
and
to
take
in
the
last
round
between
them
a
leading
part
in
compassing
hudson
death
one
authority
and
a
very
good
authority
for
the
facts
which
juet
suppressed
concerning
the
third
voyage
is
the
historian
van
meteren
who
obtained
them
there
is
good
reason
for
believing
directly
from
hudson
himself
in
his
historie
der
niederlanden
van
meteren
wrote
this
henry
hudson
left
the
texel
the
of
april
and
having
doubled
the
cape
of
norway
the
of
may
directed
his
course
along
the
northern
coasts
toward
nova
zembla
but
he
there
found
the
sea
as
full
of
ice
as
he
had
found
it
in
the
preceding
year
so
that
he
lost
the
hope
of
effecting
anything
during
the
season
this
circumstance
and
the
cold
which
some
of
his
men
who
had
been
in
the
east
indies
could
not
bear
caused
quarrels
among
the
crew
they
being
partly
english
partly
dutch
upon
which
the
captain
henry
hudson
laid
before
them
two
propositions
the
first
of
these
was
to
go
to
the
coast
of
america
to
the
latitude
of
forty
degrees
this
idea
had
been
suggested
to
him
by
some
letters
and
maps
which
his
friend
captain
smith
had
sent
him
from
virginia
and
by
which
he
informed
him
that
there
was
a
sea
leading
into
the
western
ocean
to
the
north
of
the
southern
english
colony
virginia
had
this
information
been
true
experience
goes
as
yet
to
the
contrary
it
would
have
been
of
great
advantage
as
indicating
a
short
way
to
india
the
other
proposition
was
to
direct
their
search
to
davis
straits
this
meeting
with
general
approval
they
sailed
on
the
of
may
and
arrived
with
a
good
wind
at
the
faroe
islands
where
they
stopped
but
hours
to
supply
themselves
with
fresh
water
after
leaving
these
islands
they
sailed
on
till
on
the
of
july
they
reached
the
coast
of
nova
francia
under
degrees
they
left
that
place
on
the
of
july
and
kept
out
at
sea
till
the
of
august
when
they
were
again
near
the
coast
in
degrees
of
latitude
thence
they
sailed
on
till
on
the
of
august
they
reached
the
shore
under
thence
they
sailed
along
the
shore
until
we
sic
reached
where
they
found
a
good
entrance
between
two
headlands
and
thus
entered
on
the
of
september
into
as
fine
a
river
as
can
be
found
with
good
anchoring
ground
on
both
sides
that
river
as
fine
as
can
be
found
was
our
own
hudson
van
meteren
account
of
the
voyage
although
not
published
until
the
year
was
written
very
soon
after
hudson
return
the
slip
that
he
makes
in
using
we
points
to
the
probability
that
he
copied
directly
from
hudson
log
and
in
it
we
have
all
that
we
ever
are
likely
to
know
about
the
causes
which
led
to
the
change
in
the
half
moon
course
for
my
own
part
i
believe
that
hudson
did
precisely
what
he
had
wanted
to
do
from
the
start
the
prohibitory
clause
in
his
instructions
forbidding
him
to
go
upon
other
than
the
course
laid
down
for
him
pointedly
suggests
that
he
had
expressed
the
desire
natural
enough
since
he
twice
had
searched
vainly
for
a
passage
by
nova
zembla
to
search
westward
instead
of
eastward
for
a
to
the
indies
as
van
meteren
states
authoritatively
he
was
encouraged
to
search
in
that
direction
by
the
information
given
him
by
captain
john
smith
concerning
a
passage
north
of
virginia
across
the
american
continent
a
notion
that
smith
probably
derived
in
the
first
instance
from
michael
lok
planisphere
which
shows
the
continent
reduced
to
a
mere
strip
in
about
the
latitude
of
the
river
that
hudson
found
and
that
he
very
well
might
have
conceived
to
be
confirmed
by
stories
about
a
great
sea
not
far
westward
the
great
lakes
which
he
heard
from
the
indians
but
the
starting
point
of
this
geographical
error
is
immaterial
the
important
fact
is
that
hudson
entertained
it
and
so
was
led
to
offer
for
first
choice
to
his
mutinous
crew
that
they
should
go
to
the
coast
of
america
in
the
latitude
of
forty
degrees
his
readiness
with
that
proposition
when
the
chance
to
make
it
came
confirms
my
belief
that
his
own
desire
was
to
sail
westward
and
that
he
made
the
most
of
his
opportunity
and
the
essential
point
after
all
is
not
whether
the
mutiny
forced
him
to
change
or
merely
gave
him
an
excuse
for
changing
his
ordered
course
it
is
that
he
was
equal
to
the
emergency
when
the
mutiny
came
and
so
controlled
it
that
instead
of
going
back
defeated
of
his
purpose
to
holland
he
deliberately
took
the
risk
of
personal
loss
that
attended
breaking
his
contract
and
traversing
his
orders
and
continued
on
new
lines
his
exploring
voyage
it
is
indicative
of
hudson
character
that
he
met
that
cast
of
fate
against
him
most
resolutely
and
most
resolutely
played
up
to
it
with
a
strong
hand
vii
as
the
direct
result
of
breaking
his
orders
hudson
was
the
discoverer
of
our
river
to
which
therefore
his
name
properly
has
been
given
and
also
was
the
first
navigator
by
whom
our
harbor
effectively
was
found
i
use
advisedly
these
precisely
differentiating
terms
on
the
distinctions
which
they
make
rests
hudson
claim
to
take
practical
precedence
of
verrazano
and
of
gomez
who
sailed
in
past
sandy
hook
nearly
a
hundred
years
ahead
of
him
and
of
those
shadowy
nameless
shipmen
who
in
the
intervening
time
until
his
coming
may
have
made
our
harbor
one
of
their
stations
for
refitting
and
watering
on
their
voyages
from
and
to
portugal
and
spain
the
exploring
work
of
john
and
of
sebastian
cabot
who
sailed
along
our
coast
but
who
missed
our
harbor
does
not
come
within
my
range
save
to
note
that
sebastian
cabot
pretty
certainly
was
one
of
the
several
navigators
including
frobisher
and
davis
who
entered
hudson
strait
before
hudson
time
verrazano
was
an
italian
sailing
in
the
french
service
gomez
was
a
portuguese
sailing
in
the
spanish
service
both
sought
a
westerly
way
to
the
indies
and
both
sought
it
in
the
same
year
verrazano
has
left
a
report
of
his
voyage
written
immediately
upon
his
return
to
france
and
with
it
a
vaguely
drawn
chart
of
the
coasts
which
he
explored
it
is
my
duty
to
add
that
certain
zealous
historians
have
denounced
his
report
as
a
forgery
and
his
chart
as
a
fake
a
matter
so
much
too
large
for
discussion
here
that
i
content
myself
with
expressing
the
opinion
that
these
charges
have
not
been
sustained
gomez
has
left
no
report
of
his
voyage
but
a
partial
account
of
it
may
be
pieced
together
from
the
maritime
chronicles
of
his
time
he
also
charted
with
an
approximate
accuracy
the
lands
which
he
coasted
and
while
his
chart
has
not
been
preserved
in
its
original
shape
there
is
good
reason
for
believing
that
we
have
it
embodied
in
the
planisphere
drawn
by
juan
ribero
geographer
to
charles
in
the
year
on
that
planisphere
the
seaboard
of
the
present
states
of
maryland
new
jersey
new
york
and
rhode
island
is
called
the
land
of
estevan
gomez
lacking
the
full
report
that
gomez
presumably
made
of
his
voyage
and
lacking
the
original
of
his
chart
it
is
impossible
to
decide
whether
he
did
or
did
not
pass
through
the
narrows
and
enter
the
upper
bay
doctor
asher
holds
that
he
did
make
that
passage
and
adds
it
is
certain
that
the
later
spanish
seamen
who
followed
in
his
track
in
after
years
were
familiar
with
the
hudson
river
and
called
it
the
rio
de
gamas
in
support
of
this
strong
assertion
he
cites
the
rutters
or
routiers
of
the
period
the
ocean
showing
the
distances
from
place
to
place
marking
convenient
stations
for
watering
and
refitting
and
describing
the
entrances
to
rivers
and
to
harbors
from
which
we
learn
he
declares
that
the
rio
de
gamas
the
name
then
regularly
applied
to
the
hudson
on
the
charts
of
the
time
was
one
of
these
stages
between
new
foundland
and
the
colonies
of
central
america
footnote
asher
mentions
in
this
connection
that
nantucket
island
also
figures
in
some
of
these
rutters
under
the
name
of
the
island
of
juan
luis
or
juan
fernandez
and
is
recommended
as
a
most
convenient
stage
for
those
who
coming
from
europe
wish
to
proceed
to
the
west
indies
by
way
of
the
bermudas
in
regard
to
verrazano
admitting
his
report
to
be
genuine
the
fact
that
he
did
pass
through
the
narrows
into
the
upper
bay
is
not
open
to
dispute
he
therefore
must
have
seen
as
a
little
later
gomez
may
have
seen
the
true
mouth
of
hudson
river
years
before
hudson
by
actual
exploration
of
it
made
himself
its
discoverer
but
verrazano
by
his
own
showing
came
but
a
little
way
into
the
upper
bay
which
he
called
a
lake
and
he
made
no
exploration
of
a
practical
sort
of
the
harbor
that
he
had
found
it
is
but
simple
justice
to
verrazano
and
to
gomez
to
put
on
record
here
along
with
the
story
of
hudson
effective
discovery
the
story
of
their
ineffective
finding
fate
was
against
them
as
distinctly
as
it
was
with
hudson
they
came
under
adverse
conditions
and
they
came
too
soon
back
of
the
explorer
in
the
french
service
there
was
not
an
alert
power
eager
for
colonial
expansion
back
of
the
explorer
in
the
spanish
service
there
was
a
power
so
busied
with
colonial
expansion
on
a
huge
scale
in
that
very
year
cortes
was
completing
his
conquest
of
mexico
and
pizarro
was
beginning
his
conquest
of
peru
that
a
farther
enlargement
of
the
colonization
contract
was
impossible
illustration
of
of
the
most
famous
sea
handbook
of
hudson
time
therefore
we
may
fall
back
upon
the
assured
fact
in
which
i
see
again
the
touch
of
fatalism
that
not
until
hudson
came
at
the
right
moment
and
at
the
right
moment
gave
an
accurate
account
of
his
explorations
to
a
power
that
was
ready
immediately
to
colonize
the
land
that
he
had
found
were
our
port
and
our
river
notwithstanding
their
earlier
technical
discovery
truly
discovered
to
the
world
as
for
the

assuredly
is

from

log
i
make
the
following
extracts
telling
of
the

approach
to
sandy

and
of
her
passage
into
the
lower
bay
the
first
of
september
faire
weather
the

variable
betweene
east
and
sooth
we
steered
away
north
north
west
at
noone
we
found
our
height
a
little
north
of
cape
may
to
bee
degrees
minutes
the
second
in
the
morning
close
weather
the
winde
at
south
in
the
morning
from
twelve
untill
two
of
the
clocke
we
steered
north
north
west
and
had
sounding
one
and
twentie
fathoms
and
in
running
one
glasse
we
had
but
sixteene
fathoms
then
seventeene
and
so
shoalder
and
shoalder
untill
it
came
to
twelve
fathoms
we
saw
a
great
fire
but
could
not
see
the
land
then
we
came
to
ten
fathoms
whereupon
we
brought
our
tacks
aboord
and
stood
to
the
eastward
east
south
east
foure
glasses
then
the
sunne
arose
and
we
steered
away
north
againe
and
saw
the
land
the
low
region
about
sandy
hook
from
the
west
by
north
to
the
north
west
by
north
all
like
broken
islands
and
our
soundings
were
eleven
and
ten
fathoms
then
we
looft
in
for
the
shoare
and
faire
by
the
shoare
we
had
seven
fathoms
the
course
along
the
land
we
found
to
be
north
east
by
north
from
the
land
which
we
had
first
sight
of
untill
we
came
to
a
great
lake
of
water
the
lower
bay
as
we
could
judge
it
to
be
being
drowned
land
which
made
it
to
rise
like
islands
which
was
in
length
ten
leagues
the
mouth
of
that
land
hath
many
shoalds
and
the
sea
breaketh
on
them
as
it
is
cast
out
of
the
mouth
of
it
and
from
that
lake
or
bay
the
land
lyeth
north
by
east
and
we
had
a
great
streame
out
of
the
bay
and
from
thence
our
sounding
was
ten
fathoms
two
leagues
from
the
land
at
five
of
the
clocke
we
anchored
being
little
winde
and
rode
in
eight
fathoms
water
this
night
i
found
the
land
to
hall
the
compasse
degrees
for
to
the
northward
off
us
we
saw
high
hils
staten
island
and
the
highlands
for
the
day
before
we
found
not
above
two
degrees
of
variation
this
is
a
very
good
land
to
fall
with
and
a
pleasant
land
to
see
the
third
the
morning
mystie
untill
ten
of
the
clocke
then
it
cleered
and
the
wind
came
to
the
south
south
east
so
wee
weighed
and
stood
to
the
northward
the
land
is
very
pleasant
and
high
and
bold
to
fall
withal
at
three
of
the
clocke
in
the
after
noone
we
came
to
three
great
rivers
the
raritan
the
arthur
kill
and
the
narrows
so
we
stood
along
to
the
northermost
the
narrows
thinking
to
have
gone
into
it
but
we
found
it
to
have
a
very
shoald
barre
before
it
for
we
had
but
ten
foot
water
then
we
cast
about
to
the
southward
and
found
two
fathoms
three
fathoms
and
three
and
a
quarter
till
we
came
to
the
souther
side
of
them
then
we
had
five
and
sixe
fathoms
and
anchored
so
wee
sent
in
our
boate
to
sound
and
they
found
no
lesse
water
than
foure
five
sixe
and
seven
fathoms
and
returned
in
an
houre
and
a
halfe
so
we
weighed
and
went
in
and
rode
in
five
fathoms
oze
ground
and
saw
many
salmons
and
mullets
and
rayes
very
great
the
height
is
degrees
minutes
that
is
the
authoritative
account
of
hudson
great
finding
i
have
quoted
it
in
full
partly
because
of
the
thrilling
interest
that
it
has
for
us
but
more
to
show
that
the
record
of
his
explorations
the
half
moon
log
being
written
throughout
with
the
same
definiteness
and
accuracy
gave
what
neither
gomez
nor
verrazano
gave
clear
directions
for
finding
with
certainty
the
haven
that
he
and
those
earlier
navigators
had
found
by
chance
on
that
fact
and
on
the
other
fact
that
his
directions
promptly
were
utilized
rests
his
claim
to
be
the
practical
discoverer
of
the
harbor
of
new
york
for
more
than
a
week
the
half
moon
lay
in
the
lower
bay
and
in
the
narrows
then
on
the
eleventh
of
september
she
passed
fairly
beyond
staten
island
and
came
out
into
the
upper
bay
and
hudson
saw
the
great
river
which
on
that
day
became
his
river
stretching
broadly
to
the
north
i
can
imagine
that
when
he
found
that
wide
waterway
leading
from
the
ocean
into
the
heart
of
the
continent
and
found
it
precisely
where
his
friend
captain
john
smith
had
told
him
he
would
find
it
under
degrees
his
hopes
were
very
high
the
first
part
of
the
story
being
confirmed
it
was
a
fair
inference
that
the
second
part
would
be
confirmed
that
presently
sailing
through
the
strait
that
he
had
entered
he
would
come
out
as
magellan
had
come
out
from
the
other
strait
upon
the
pacific
with
clear
water
before
him
to
the
coasts
of
cathay
that
glad
hope
must
have
filled
his
heart
during
the
ensuing
fortnight
and
even
then
it
must
have
died
out
slowly
through
another
week
while
the
half
moon
worked
her
way
northward
as
far
as
where
albany
now
stands
twice
in
the
course
of
his
voyage
inland
on
september
when
his
run
was
from
yonkers
to
peekskill
he
reasonably
may
have
believed
that
he
was
on
the
very
edge
of
his
great
discovery
as
the
river
widened
hugely
into
the
tappan
sea
and
again
widened
hugely
into
haverstraw
bay
it
well
may
have
seemed
to
him
that
he
was
come
to
the
ocean
outlet
and
that
in
a
few
hours
more
he
would
have
the
waters
of
the
pacific
beneath
his
keel
then
as
he
passed
through
the
southern
gate
of
the
highlands
and
thence
onward
his
hope
must
have
waned
until
on
september
it
vanished
utterly
away
under
that
date
juet
wrote
in
his
log
this
night
at
ten
of
the
clocke
our
boat
returned
in
a
showre
of
raine
from
sounding
the
river
and
found
it
to
bee
at
an
end
for
shipping
to
goe
in
that
was
the
end
of
the
adventure
inland
juet
wrote
on
the
at
twelve
of
the
clocke
we
weighed
and
went
downe
two
leagues
and
thereafter
his
log
records
their
movements
and
their
doings
sometimes
meeting
with
loving
people
with
whom
they
had
friendly
dealings
sometimes
meeting
and
having
fights
with
people
who
were
anything
but
loving
as
the
half
moon
dawdled
slowly
down
the
stream
by
the
of
october
they
were
come
abreast
of
about
where
fort
lee
now
stands
there
they
had
their
last
brush
with
the
savages
killing
ten
or
twelve
of
them
without
loss
on
their
own
side
after
telling
about
the
fight
juet
adds
within
a
while
after
wee
got
downe
two
leagues
beyond
that
place
and
anchored
in
a
bay
north
of
hoboken
cleere
from
all
danger
of
them
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
where
we
saw
a
very
good
piece
of
ground
for
anchorage
and
hard
by
it
there
was
a
cliffe
wiehawken
that
looked
of
the
colour
of
a
white
greene
as
though
it
were
either
copper
or
silver
myne
and
i
thinke
it
to
be
one
of
them
by
the
trees
that
grow
upon
it
for
they
be
all
burned
and
the
other
places
are
greene
as
grasse
it
is
on
that
side
of
the
river
that
is
called
there
we
saw
no
people
to
trouble
us
and
rode
quietly
all
night
but
had
much
wind
and
raine
in
that
entry
the
name
was
written
for
the
first
time
and
was
applied
not
to
our
island
but
to
the
opposite
jersey
shore
the
explanation
of
juet
record
seems
to
be
that
the
indians
known
as
the
mannahattes
dwelt
or
that
juet
thought
that
they
dwelt
on
both
sides
of
the
river
that
they
did
dwell
on
and
that
they
did
give
their
name
to
our
island
of
manhattan
are
facts
absolutely
established
by
the
records
of
the
ensuing
three
or
four
years
during
october
the
half
moon
was
on
the
juet
records
faire
weather
and
the
wind
at
north
north
west
wee
weighed
and
came
out
of
the
river
into
which
we
had
runne
so
farre
thence
through
the
upper
bay
and
the
narrows
and
across
the
lower
bay
with
a
boat
out
ahead
to
sound
they
went
onward
into
the
sandy
hook
channel
and
by
twelve
of
the
clocke
we
were
cleere
of
all
the
inlet
then
we
took
in
our
boat
and
set
our
mayne
sayle
and
sprit
sayle
and
our
top
sayles
and
steered
away
east

and
concludes
passing
over
unmentioned
the
mutiny
that
occurred
before
the
ship
course
definitely
was
set
eastward
in
these
words
we
continued
our
course
toward
england
without
seeing
any
land
by
the
way
all
the
rest
of
this

of
october
and
on

by

i
reproduce
the
following
note
that
tells
of
the
little
half

dismal
ending
the
subsequent
career
of

may
perhaps
interest
the
curious
the
small
book
before
referred
to
which
i
found
in
in
the
company
archives
at
amsterdam
besides
recording
the
return
of
the

on
the
of

states
that
on
the
of
may
she
sailed
in
company
with
other
vessels
to
the
east
indies
under
the
command
of
laurens

and
that
on

upon

into
our

the
most
fruitful
of
all
his
adventurings
since
the
planting
of
our
city
was
the
outcome
of
it
was
a
failure
hessel
gerritz
wrote
all
that
he
did
in
the
west
in
was
to
exchange
his
merchandise
for
furs
in
new
france
and
hudson
himself
no
doubt
rated
his
great
accomplishment
on
which
so
large
a
part
of
his
fame
rests
enduringly
as
a
mere
waste
of
energy
and
of
time
i
hope
that
he
knows
about
and
takes
a
comforting
pride
in
over
there
in
the
shades
the
great
city
which
owes
its
founding
to
that
seemingly
bootless
voyage
ix
what
happened
to
hudson
when
he
reached
dartmouth
has
been
recorded
and
broadly
why
it
happened
hessel
gerritz
wrote
that
he
returned
safely
to
england
where
he
was
accused
of
having
undertaken
a
voyage
to
the
detriment
of
his
own
country
van
meteren
wrote
a
long
time
elapsed
through
contrary
winds
before
the
company
could
be
informed
of
the
arrival
of
the
ship
the
half
moon
in
england
then
they
ordered
the
ship
and
crew
to
return
to
holland
as
soon
as
possible
but
when
they
were
going
to
do
so
henry
hudson
and
the
other
englishmen
of
the
ship
were
commanded
by
government
there
not
to
leave
england
but
to
serve
their
own
country
obviously
international
trade
jealousies
were
at
the
root
of
the
matter
conceivably
as
i
have
stated
the
muscovy
company
a
much
interested
party
was
the
prime
mover
in
the
seizure
of
hudson
out
of
the
dutch
service
but
we
only
know
certainly
that
he
was
seized
out
of
that
service
with
the
result
that
he
and
fate
came
to
grips
again
and
that
fate
hold
on
him
did
not
loosen
until
death
cast
it
off
hudson
fourth
and
last
voyage
was
not
made
for
the
muscovy
company
but
those
chiefly
concerned
in
promoting
it
were
members
of
that
company
and
two
of
them
were
members
of
the
first
importance
in
the
direction
of
its
affairs
the
adventure
was
set
forth
mainly
by
sir
dudley
digges
sir
thomas
smith
and
master
john
wolstenholme
who
severally
are
commemorated
in
the
arctic
by
smith
sound
cape
digges
and
cape
wolstenholme
and
the
expedition
got
away
from
london
in
the
barke
on
april
purchas
wrote
a
nearly
contemporary
history
of
this
voyage
that
included
three
strictly
contemporary
documents
two
of
them
certainly
written
aboard
the
discovery
and
the
third
either
written
aboard
the
ship
on
the
voyage
home
as
is
possible
or
not
long
after
the
ship
had
arrived
in
england
the
first
of
these
documents
is
an
abstract
of
the
journal
of
master
henry
hudson
this
is
hudson
own
log
but
badly
mutilated
it
begins
on
the
day
of
sailing
april
and
ends
on
the
ensuing
august
there
are
many
gaps
in
it
and
the
block
of
more
than
ten
months
is
gone
the
missing
portions
presumably
were
destroyed
by
the
mutineers
the
second
document
is
styled
by
purchas
a
note
found
in
the
deske
of
thomas
wydowse
student
in
the
mathematickes
hee
being
one
of
them
who
was
put
into
the
shallop
concerning
this
poor
student
in
the
mathematickes
prickett
testified
before
the
court
thomas
widowes
was
thrust
out
of
the
ship
into
the
shallop
but
whether
he
willed
them
take
his
keys
and
share
his
goods
to
save
his
life
this
examinate
knoweth
not
practically
this
is
an
assurance
that
he
did
make
such
an
offer
and
his
despairing
resistance
to
being
outcast
is
implied
also
in
the
pathetic
note
following
his
name
in
the
trinity
house
list
of
the
abandoned
ones
put
away
in
great
distress
there
is
nothing
to
show
how
he
happened
to
be
aboard
the
discovery
nor
who
he
was
possibly
he
may
have
been
a
son
of
the
richard
widowes
goldsmith
who
is
named
in
the
second
charter
of
the
virginia
company
his
note
cited
in
full
later
on
exhibits
clearly
the
evil
conditions
that
obtained
aboard
the
discovery
and
especially
makes
clear
that
juet
mutinous
disposition
began
to
be
manifested
at
a
very
early
stage
of
the
voyage
the
third
document
is
the
most
important
in
that
it
gives
or
professes
to
give
a
complete
history
of
the
whole
voyage
purchas
styles
it
a
larger
discourse
of
the
same
voyage
and
the
successe
thereof
written
by
abacucks
prickett
a
servant
of
sir
dudley
digges
whom
the
mutineers
had
saved
in
hope
to
procure
his
master
to
worke
their
pardon
purchas
wrote
that
this
report
of
prickett
may
happely
bee
suspected
by
some
as
not
so
friendly
to
hudson
being
essentially
a
bit
of
special
pleading
intended
to
save
his
own
neck
and
the
necks
of
his
companions
it
has
rested
always
under
the
suspicion
that
purchas
cast
upon
it
nor
is
it
relieved
from
suspicion
by
the
fact
that
it
is
in
accord
with
his
sworn
testimony
and
with
the
sworn
testimony
of
his
fellows
before
the
high
court
of
admiralty
when
he
and
they
were
on
trial
for
their
lives
as
mutineers
the
imperfect
record
of
this
trial
merely
shows
that
prickett
and
all
of
the
other
witnesses
with
the
partial
exception
of
byleth
told
substantially
the
same
story
and
as
they
all
equally
were
in
danger
of
hanging
that
story
most
naturally
was
in
their
own
favor
and
in
much
the
same
words
from
the
trinity
house
record
it
appears
that
prickett
was
a
land
man
put
in
by
the
adventurers
and
in
the
court
records
he
is
described
most
incongruously
as
a
haberdasher
facts
which
place
him
as
his
own
very
remarkable
narrative
places
him
on
a
level
much
above
that
of
the
ordinary
seamen
of
hudson
time
asher
comment
upon
prickett
discourse
is
a
just
determination
of
its
value
though
the
paper
he
has
left
us
is
in
form
a
narrative
the
author
real
intention
was
much
more
to
defend
the
mutineers
than
to
describe
the
voyage
as
an
apologetic
essay
the
discourse
is
extremely
clever
it
manages
to
cast
some
not
too
much
shadow
upon
hudson
himself
the
main
fault
of
the
mutiny
is
thrown
upon
some
men
who
had
ceased
to
live
when
the
ship
reached
home
those
who
were
then
still
alive
are
presented
as
guiltless
some
as
highly
deserving
account
of
the
mutiny
and
of
its
cause
has
often
been
suspected
even
purchas
himself
and
fox
speak
of
it
with
distrust
but
prickett
is
the
only
that
has
left
us
an
account
of
these
events
and
we
can
therefore
not
correct
his
statements
whether
they
be
true
or
false
my
fortunate
finding
of
contemporary
documents
unknown
to
most
authoritative
historian
has
produced
other
who
have
left
us
an
account
of
these
events
but
obviously
their
accounts
so
harmoniously
in
agreement
do
not
affect
the
soundness
of
asher
conclusions
the
net
result
of
it
all
being
as
i
have
written
that
our
whole
knowledge
of
murder
is
only
so
much
of
the
truth
as
his
murderers
were
agreed
upon
to
tell
x
in
the
ruling
of
that
his
last
adventure
all
of
hudson
malign
stars
seem
to
have
been
in
the
ascendant
his
evil
genius
juet
again
sailed
with
him
as
mate
and
out
of
sheer
apparently
he
took
along
with
him
in
the
discovery
another
villainous
personage
one
henry
greene
who
showed
his
gratitude
for
benefits
conferred
by
joining
eagerly
with
juet
in
the
mutiny
that
resulted
in
the
murder
of
their
common
benefactor
hudson
therefore
started
on
that
dismal
voyage
with
two
firebrands
in
his
ship
company
and
ship
companies
of
those
days
without
help
from
firebrands
were
like
enough
to
explode
into
mutiny
of
their
own
accord
i
must
repeat
that
the
of
hudson
time
and
until
long
after
hudson
time
were
little
better
than
dangerous
brutes
and
the
savage
ferocity
that
was
in
them
was
kept
in
check
only
by
meeting
it
with
a
more
savage
ferocity
on
the
part
of
their
superiors
at
the
very
outset
of
the
voyage
trouble
began
hudson
wrote
on
april
when
he
was
in
the
mouth
of
the
thames
off
the
isle
of
sheppey
i
caused
master
coleburne
to
bee
put
into
a
pinke
bound
for
london
with
my
letter
to
the
adventurars
imparting
the
reason
why
i
put
him
out
of
the
ship
he
does
not
add
what
that
reason
was
nor
is
there
any
reference
in
what
remains
of
his
log
to
farther
difficulties
with
his
crew
the
newly
discovered
testimony
of
the
mutineers
cited
later
refers
only
to
the
final
mutiny
prickett
therefore
in
part
borne
out
by
the
note
of
poor
widowes
is
our
authority
for
the
several
mutinous
outbreaks
which
occurred
during
the
voyage
and
prickett
wrote
with
a
vagueness
using
such
phrases
as
this
day
and
this
time
without
adding
a
date
that
helped
him
to
muddle
his
narrative
in
the
parts
which
we
want
to
have
but
which
he
did
not
want
to
have
most
clear
footnote
captain
lake
fox
has
the
following
in
the
road
of
lee
in
the
river
thames
he
hudson
caused
master
coalbrand
to
be
set
in
a
pinke
to
be
carried
back
againe
to
london
this
coalbrand
was
in
every
way
held
to
be
a
better
man
than
himselfe
being
put
in
by
the
adventurers
as
his
assistant
who
envying
the
same
he
having
the
command
in
his
own
hands
devised
this
course
to
send
himselfe
the
same
way
though
in
a
farre
worse
place
as
hereafter
followeth
prickett
tells
only
thwart
of
sheppey
our
master
sent
master
colbert
back
to
the
owners
with
his
letter
prickett
first
record
of
trouble
refers
to
some
period
in
july
at
which
time
the
discovery
was
within
the
mouth
of
strait
and
was
beset
with
ice
it
reads
some
of
our
men
this
day
fell
sicke
i
will
not
say
it
was
for
feare
although
i
saw
small
signe
of
other
griefe
his
next
entry
seems
to
date
a
fortnight
or
so
later
when
the
ship
was
farther
within
the
strait
and
temporarily
here
our
master
was
in
despaire
and
as
he
told
me
after
he
thought
he
should
never
have
got
out
of
this
ice
but
there
have
perished
therefore
he
brought
forth
his
card
chart
and
showed
all
the
company
that
hee
was
entered
above
an
hundred
leagues
farther
than
ever
any
english
was
and
left
it
to
their
choice
whether
they
should
proceed
any
farther
yea
or
nay
whereupon
some
were
of
one
minde
and
some
of
another
some
wishing
themselves
at
home
and
some
not
caring
where
so
they
were
out
of
the
ice
but
there
were
some
who
then
spake
words
which
were
remembered
a
great
while
after
this
record
shows
that
hudson
had
with
him
a
chart
of
the
strait
presumably
based
on
earlier
exploration
of
it
with
the
discovery
of
which
he
popularly
is
credited
and
as
weymouth
sailed
into
the
strait
a
hundred
leagues
his
assertion
that
he
had
entered
a
hundred
leagues
farther
than
ever
any
english
was
obviously
is
an
error
but
the
more
important
matter
made
clear
by
prickett
admitting
that
prickett
told
the
truth
is
that
a
dangerously
ugly
feeling
was
abroad
among
the
crew
nearly
a
year
before
that
feeling
culminated
in
the
final
tragedy
prickett
concludes
this
episode
by
showing
that
hudson
eager
desire
to
press
on
prevailed
after
many
words
to
no
purpose
to
worke
we
must
on
all
hands
to
get
ourselves
out
and
to
cleere
our
ship
and
so
the
discovery
went
onward
sometimes
working
her
way
through
the
ice
sometimes
sailing
freely
in
clear
water
until
hudson
triumphantly
brought
her
as
purchas
puts
it
into
a
spacious
sea
wherein
he
sayled
above
a
hundred
leagues
south
confidently
proud
that
he
had
won
the
passage
it
was
his
resolve
to
push
on
until
he
could
be
sure
that
he
truly
had
won
the
passage
that
won
him
to
his
death
when
they
had
entered
that
spacious
sea
rounding
the
cape
which
then
received
its
name
of
cape
wolstenholme
they
came
to
where
sorrel
and
grew
plentifully
and
where
there
was
great
store
of
fowle
prickett
records
that
the
crew
urged
hudson
to
stay
a
daye
or
two
in
this
place
telling
him
what
refreshment
might
there
bee
had
but
by
no
means
would
he
stay
who
was
not
pleased
with
the
motion
this
refers
to
august
the
day
on
which
hudson
log
ends
prickett
adds
significantly
so
we
left
the
fowle
and
lost
our
way
downe
to
the
south
west
by
september
the
discovery
was
come
into
james
bay
at
the
southern
extremity
of
hudson
bay
and
then
it
was
that
the
serious
trouble
began
by
prickett
showing
there
seems
to
have
been
a
clash
of
opinions
in
regard
to
the
ship
course
and
of
so
violent
a
sort
that
strong
measures
were
required
to
maintain
discipline
the
outcome
was
that
our
master
took
occasion
to
revive
old
matters
and
to
displace
robert
juet
from
being
his
mate
and
the
boatswaine
from
his
place
for
the
words
spoken
in
the
first
great
bay
of
ice
for
what
happened
at
that
time
we
have
a
better
authority
than
prickett
the
note
of
thomas
widowes
covers
this
episode
and
in
covering
it
throws
light
upon
the
mutinous
conditions
which
prevailed
increasingly
as
the
voyage
went
on
as
the
only
contemporary
document
giving
hudson
side
of
the
matter
it
is
of
first
importance
we
may
be
very
sure
that
it
would
not
have
come
down
to
us
had
it
been
discovered
by
the
mutineers
and
i
cite
it
here
in
full
as
purchas
prints
it
the
tenth
day
of
september
after
dinner
our
master
called
all
the
companie
together
to
heare
and
beare
witnesse
of
the
abuse
of
some
of
the
companie
it
having
beene
the
request
of
robert
juet
that
the
master
should
redresse
some
abuses
and
slanders
as
hee
called
them
against
this
juet
which
thing
after
the
master
had
examined
and
heard
with
equitie
what
hee
could
say
for
himselfe
there
were
proued
so
many
and
great
abuses
and
mutinous
matters
against
the
master
and
the
action
by
juet
that
there
was
danger
to
have
suffered
them
longer
and
it
was
fit
time
to
punish
and
cut
off
farther
occasions
of
the
like
mutinies
it
was
proved
to
his
face
first
with
bennet
mathew
our
trumpet
upon
our
first
sight
of
island
iceland
and
he
confest
that
he
supposed
that
in
the
action
would
be
man
slaughter
and
proue
bloodie
to
some
secondly
at
our
coming
from
island
in
hearing
of
the
companie
hee
did
threaten
to
turne
the
head
of
the
ship
home
from
the
action
which
at
that
time
was
by
our
master
wisely
pacified
hoping
of
amendment
thirdly
it
was
deposed
by
philip
staffe
our
carpenter
and
ladlie
arnold
arnold
ludlow
to
his
face
upon
the
holy
bible
that
hee
perswaded
them
to
keepe
muskets
charged
and
swords
readie
in
their
cabbins
for
they
should
be
charged
with
shot
ere
the
voyage
was
over
fourthly
wee
being
pestered
in
the
ice
hee
had
used
words
tending
to
mutinie
discouragement
and
slander
of
the
action
which
easily
took
effect
in
those
that
were
timorous
and
had
not
the
master
in
time
preuented
it
might
easily
have
overthrowne
the
voyage
and
now
lately
being
imbayed
in
a
deepe
bay
which
the
master
had
desire
to
see
for
some
reasons
to
himselfe
knowne
his
word
tended
altogether
to
put
the
companie
into
a
fray
fear
of
extremitie
by
wintering
in
cold
jesting
at
our
master
hope
to
see
bantam
by
candlemas
for
these
and
diuers
other
base
slanders
against
the
master
hee
was
deposed
and
robert
bylot
bileth
or
byleth
who
had
showed
himself
honestly
respecting
the
good
of
the
action
was
placed
in
his
stead
the

mate
also
francis
clement
the
boatson
at
this
time
was
put
from

william

this

had
basely
carried
himselfe
to
our
master
and

also
adrian

was
appointed

and
a
promise
by
the

that
from
this
day

should
remain
to

of

very
well

themselves
to

also
the
master
promised
if
the
offenders
yet
behaued
themselves
henceforth
honestly
hee
would
be
a
means
for
their
good
and
that
hee
would
forget
injuries
with
other
admonitions
hudson
fame
is
the
brighter
for
this
testament
of
the
poor
student
in
the
mathematickes
whose
loyalty
to
his
commander
cost
him
his
life
at
times
hudson
seems
to
have
temporized
with
his
mutinous
crews
in
this
grave
crisis
he
did
not
temporize
for
cause
he
disrated
his
chief
officers
and
so
asserted
in
that
desolate
place
as
fearlessly
as
he
would
have
asserted
it
in
an
english
harbor
that
aboard
his
ship
his
will
was
law
but
his
strong
action
only
scotched
the
mutiny
narrative
of
the
doings
of
the
ensuing
seven
weeks
deals
with
what
he
implies
was
purposeless
sailing
up
and
down
james
bay
he
casts
reflections
upon
hudson
seamanship
in
such
phrases
as
our
master
would
have
the
anchor
up
against
the
mind
of
all
who
knew
what
belongeth
thereto
and
in
all
that
he
writes
there
is
a
perceptible
note
of
resentment
of
the
master
doings
that
reflects
the
mutinous
feeling
on
board
especially
does
this
feeling
show
in
his
account
of
their
settling
into
winter
quarters
having
spent
three
moneths
in
a
labyrinth
without
end
being
now
the
last
of
october
we
went
downe
to

east
to

bay
but
returned
without

we
went
for
the
next
day
we
went
to
the
south
and
south
west
and
found
a
place
whereunto
we
brought
our
ship
and
haled
her
aground
and
this
was
the
first
of
november
by
the
tenth
thereof
we
were
frozen
in
and
then
the
arctic
night
closed
down
upon
them
and
with
it

that
they
were
prisoners

one
of
the
commentators
on

thus
has
summarized
the
conditions
of
that
dreadful
winter
of
it
was
now
october
and
the
situation
of
the
explorers
was
becoming
desperate
but
the
bickerings
seem
to
have
increased
with
their
peril
as
the
weary
days
of
starvation
and
death
wore
on
nearly
every
member
of
the
party
developed
a
grievance
israel
was
reprimanded
by
greely
for
falsely
accusing
brainard
of
unfairness
in
the
distribution
of
articles
bender
annoyed
the
whole
camp

his
complaints
regarding
his
pavy

henry
accused
fredericks
the

of
not
giving

bender

was

that

results
aboard
hudson
ship
discontent
developing
into
insubordination
hatred
of
the
commander
hatred
of
each
other
petty
squabblings
leading
on
to
tragedies
as
minor
ills
were
magnified
into
catastrophes
and
little
injuries
into
deadly
wrongs
strictly
in
keeping
with
the
mean
traditions
of
the
arctic
is
the
fact
that
the
point
of
departure
of
the
final
mutiny
was
a
wrangle
that
arose
over
the
ownership
of
a
gray
cloth
gowne
prickett
records
about
the
middle
of
this
moneth
of
november
dyed
john
williams
our
gunner
god
pardon
the
masters
uncharitable
dealing
with
this
man
now
for
that
i
am
come
to
speake
of
him
out
of
whose
ashes
as
it
were
that
unhappie
deed
grew
which
brought
a
scandall
upon
all
that
are
returned
home
and
upon
the
action
itself
the
multitude
like
the
dog
running
after
the
stone
but
not
at
the
caster
therefore
not
to
wronge
the
living
nor
slander
the
dead
i
will
by
the
leave
of
god
deliver
the
truth
as
neere
as
i
can
prickett
deliverance
of
the
truth
leaves
much
to
be
desired
without
giving
any
information
in
regard
to
hudson
uncharitable
dealing
with
the
gunner
he
takes
a
fresh
departure
in
these
words
you
shall
understand
that
our
master
kept
in
his
house
at
london
a
young
man
named
henrie
greene
borne
in
kent
of
worshipfull
parents
but
by
his
leud
life
and
conversation
hee
had
lost
the
good
will
of
all
his
frinds
and
had
spent
all
that
hee
had
this
man
our
master
would
have
to
sea
with
him
because
hee
could
write
well
this
henrie
greene
was
not
set
down
in
the
owners
booke
nor
any
wages
for
him
at
island
the
surgeon
and
hee
fell
out
in
dutch
and
hee
beat
him
ashoare
in
english
which
set
all
the
companie
in
a
rage
soe
that
wee
had
much
adoe
to
get
the
surgeon
aboord
this
curiously
parallels
the
fight
between
surgeon
pavy
and
lieutenant
kislingbury
robert
juet
the
masters
mate
would
needs
burne
his
finger
in
the
embers
and
tolde
the
carpenter
a
long
tale
when
hee
was
drunke
that
our
master
had
brought
in
greene
to
cracke
his
credit
that
should
displease
him
which
wordes
came
to
the
masters
eares
who
when
hee
understood
it
would
have
gone
back
to
island
when
hee
was
fortie
leagues
from
thence
to
have
sent
home
his
mate
robert
juet
in
a
fisherman
but
being
otherwise
perswaded
all
was
well
now
when
our
gunner
was
dead
and
as
the
order
is
in
such
cases
if
the
company
stand
in
neede
of
any
thing
that
belonged
to
the
man
deceased
then
it
is
brought
to
the
mayne
mast
and
there
sold
to
them
that
will
give
moste
for
the
same
this
gunner
had
a
gray
cloth
gowne
which
greene
prayed
the
master
to
friend
him
so
much
as
to
let
him
have
it
paying
for
it
as
another
would
give
the
master
saith
hee
should
and
thereupon
hee
answered
some
that
sought
to
have
it
that
greene
should
have
it
and
none
else
and
soe
it
rested
now
out
of
season
and
time
the
master
calleth
the
carpenter
to
goe
in
hand
with
an
house
on
shoare
which
at
the
beginning
our
master
would
not
heare
when
it
might
have
been
done
the
carpenter
told
him
that
the
snow
and
froste
were
such
as
hee
neither
could
nor
would
goe
in
hand
with
such
worke
which
when
our
master
heard
hee
ferreted
him
out
of
his
cabbin
to
strike
him
calling
him
by
many
foule
names
and
threatening
to
hang
him
the
carpenter
told
him
that
hee
knew
what
belonged
to
his
place
better
than
himselfe
and
that
he
was
no
house
carpenter
so
this
passed
and
the
house
was
after
made
with
much
labour
but
to
no
end
the
next
day
after
the
master
and
the
carpenter
fell
out
the
carpenter
took
his
peece
and
henrie
greene
with
him
for
it
was
an
order
that
none
should
goe
out
alone
but
one
with
a
peece
and
another
with
a
pike
this
did
move
the
master
soe
much
the
more
against
henrie
greene
that
robert
billot
his
mate
who
had
been
promoted
to
juet
place
must
have
the
gowne
and
had
it
delivered
unto
him
which
when
henrie
greene
saw
he
challenged
the
masters
promise
to
him
but
the
master
did
so
raile
on
greene
with
so
many
words
of
disgrace
telling
him
that
all
his
friends
would
not
trust
him
with
twenty
shillings
and
therefore
why
should
hee
as
for
wages
hee
had
none
nor
none
should
have
if
hee
did
not
please
him
well
yet
the
master
had
promised
him
to
make
his
wages
as
good
as
any
mans
in
the
ship
and
to
have
him
one
of
the
princes
guard
when
we
came
home
but
you
shall
see
how
the
devil
out
of
this
soe
wrought
with
greene
that
he
did
the
master
what
mischiefe
hee
could
in
seeking
to
discredit
him
and
to
thrust
him
and
many
other
honest
men
out
of
the
ship
in
the
end
to
speake
of
all
our
trouble
in
this
time
of
winter
which
was
so
colde
as
it
lamed
the
most
of
our
companie
and
my
selfe
doe
yet
feele
it
would
bee
too
tedious
that
is
all
that
prickett
tells
about
their
wintering
but
what
he
leaves
untold
as
too
tedious
easily
may
be
filled
in
beginning
with
that
brabble
over
the
gray
cloth
gowne
there
must
have
gone
on
in
hudson
party
the
same
bickerings
and
wranglings
that
went
on
in
greely
party
and
the
same
development
of
small
animosities
into
burning
hatreds
and
it
all
with
hudson
people
must
have
been
rougher
and
fiercer
and
deadlier
than
it
was
with
people
because
hudson
crew
was
of
a
time
when
for
cause
were
called
while
greely
crew
was
the
better
yet
exhibited
scant
evidence
of
it
by
an
additional
two
centuries
and
a
half
of
civilization
and
was
made
up
though
with
little
to
show
for
it
of
picked
men
xii
the
end
came
in
the
through
the
winter
the
party
had
such
store
of
fowle
and
later
had
for
a
while
so
good
a
supply
of
fish
that
starvation
was
staved
off
when
the
ice
broke
up
about
the
middle
of
june
hudson
sailed
from
his
winter
quarters
and
went
out
a
little
way
into
hudson
bay
there
they
were
caught
and
held
in
the
floating
ice
with
their
stores
almost
exhausted
and
with
no
more
fowl
nor
fish
to
be
had
then
the
nip
of
hunger
came
and
with
it
came
openly
the
mutiny
that
secretly
had
been
fermenting
through
those
months
of
cold
and
gloom
prickett
writes
being
thus
in
the
ice
on
saturday
the
one
and
twentieth
of
june
at
night
wilson
the
boat
swayne
and
henry
greene
came
to
mee
lying
in
my
cabbin
lame
and
told
mee
that
they
and
the
rest
of
their
associates
would
shift
the
company
and
turne
the
master
and
all
the
sicke
men
into
the
shallop
and
let
them
shift
for
themselves
for
there
was
not
fourteen
daies
victuall
left
for
all
the
company
at
that
poore
allowance
they
were
at
and
that
there
they
lay
the
master
not
caring
to
goe
one
way
or
other
and
that
they
had
not
eaten
any
thing
these
three
dayes
and
therefore
were
resolute
either
to
mend
or
end
and
what
they
had
begun
they
would
goe
through
with
it
or
dye
according
to
his
own
account
prickett
made
answer
to
this
precious
pair
of
scoundrels
that
he
marvelled
to
heare
so
much
from
them
considering
that
they
were
married
men
and
had
wives
and
children
and
that
for
their
sakes
they
should
not
commit
so
foule
a
thing
in
the
sight
of
god
and
man
as
that
would
bee
to
which
greene
replied
that
he
knew
the
worst
which
was
to
be
hanged
when
hee
came
home
and
therefore
of
the
two
he
would
rather
be
hanged
at
home
than
starved
abroad
with
that
deliverance
henry
greene
went
his
way
and
presently
came
juet
who
because
he
was
an
ancient
man
i
hoped
to
have
found
some
reason
in
him
but
hee
was
worse
than
henry
greene
for
he
sware
plainly
that
he
would
justifie
this
deed
when
he
came
home
more
of
the
conspirators
came
to
prickett
to
urge
him
to
join
them
in
their
intended
crime
we
have
his
weak
word
for
it
that
he
refused
and
that
he
tried
to
stay
them
to
which
he
weakly
adds
i
hoped
that
some
one
or
other
would
give
some
notice
either
to
the
carpenter
or
to
john
king
or
the
master
that
he
did
not
try
to
give
some
notice
himself
is
the
blackest
count
against
him
the
just
inference
may
be
drawn
from
his
narrative
as
a
whole
that
he
was
a
liar
and
from
this
particular
section
of
it
the
farther
inference
may
be
drawn
that
he
was
a
coward
in
the
dawn
of
the
sunday
morning
the
outbreak
came
prickett
tells
that
it
began
by
clapping
the
hatch
over
john
king
one
of
the
faithful
men
who
had
gone
down
into
the
hold
for
water
and
continues
in
the
meane
time
henrie
greene
and
another
went
to
the
carpenter
philip
staffe
and
held
him
with
a
talke
till
the
master
came
out
of
his
cabbin
which
hee
soone
did
then
came
john
thomas
and
bennet
before
him
while
wilson
bound
his
arms
behind
him
he
asked
them
what
they
meant
they
told
him
he
should
know
when
he
was
in
the
shallop
now
juet
while
this
was
came
to
john
king
into
the
hold
who
was
provided
for
him
for
he
had
got
a
sword
of
his
own
and
kept
him
at
a
bay
and
might
have
killed
him
but
others
came
to
helpe
him
and
so
he
came
up
to
the
master
the
master
called
to
the
carpenter
and
told
him
that
he
was
bound
but
i
heard
no
answer
he
made
now
arnold
lodlo
and
michael
bute
rayled
at
them
and
told
them
their
knaverie
would
show
itselfe
then
was
the
shallop
haled
up
to
the
ship
side
and
the
poore
sicke
and
lame
men
were
called
upon
to
get
them
out
of
their
cabbins
into
the
shallop
the
master
called
to
me
who
came
out
of
my
cabbin
as
well
as
i
could
to
the
hatch
way
to
speake
with
him
where
on
my
knees
i
besought
them
for
the
love
of
god
to
remember
themselves
and
to
doe
as
they
would
be
done
unto
they
bade
me
keepe
myselfe
well
and
get
me
into
my
cabbin
not
suffering
the
master
to
speake
with
me
but
when
i
came
into
my
cabbin
againe
hee
called
to
me
at
the
horne
which
gave
light
into
my
cabbin
and
told
me
that
juet
would
overthrow
us
all
nay
said
i
it
is
that
villaine
henrie
greene
and
i
spake
it
not
softly
now
was
the
carpenter
at
libertie
who
asked
them
if
they
would
bee
hanged
when
they
came
home
and
as
for
himselfe
hee
said
hee
would
not
stay
in
the
ship
unless
they
would
force
him
they
bade
him
goe
then
for
they
would
not
stay
him
now
were
all
the
poore
men
in
the
shallop
whose
names
are
as
followeth
henrie
hudson
john
hudson
arnold
lodlo
sidrack
faner
philip
staffe
thomas
woodhouse
or
wydhouse
adam
moore
henrie
sic
king
michael
bute
the
carpenter
got
of
them
a
peece
and
powder
and
shot
and
some
pikes
an
iron
pot
with
some
meale
and
other
things
they
stood
out
of
the
ice
the
shallop
being
fast
to
the
sterne
of
the
shippe
and
so
when
they
were
nigh
out
for
i
can
not
say
they
were
cleane
out
they
cut
her
head
fast
from
the
sterne
of
our
ship
then
out
with
their
top
sayles
and
toward
the
east
they
stood
in
a
cleere
sea
in
the
end
they
took
in
their
top
sayles
righted
their
helme
and
lay
under
their
fore
sayle
till
they
had
ransacked
and
searched
all
places
in
the
ship
in
the
hold
they
found
one
of
the
vessels
of
meale
whole
and
the
other
halfe
spent
for
wee
had
but
two
wee
found
also
two
firkins
of
batter
some
twentie
seven
pieces
of
porke
halfe
a
bushell
of
pease
but
in
the
masters
cabbin
we
found
two
hundred
of
bisket
cakes
a
pecke
of
meale
of
beere
to
the
quantitie
of
a
butt
one
with
another
now
it
was
said
that
the
shallop
was
come
within
sight
they
let
fall
the
main
sayle
and
out
with
their
top
sayles
and
fly
as
from
an
enemy
then
i
prayed
them
yet
to
remember
themselves
but
william
wilson
more
than
the
rest
would
heare
of
no
such
matter
comming
nigh
the
east
shore
they
cast
about
and
stood
to
the
west
and
came
to
an
iland
and
anchored
heere
we
lay
that
night
and
the
best
part
of
the
next
day
in
all
which
time
we
saw
not
the
shallop
or
ever
after
that
is
the
story
of
hudson
murder
as
we
get
it
from
his
murderers
and
even
from
prickett
biased
narrative
so
complete
a
case
is
made
out
against
the
mutineers
that
there
is
comfort
in
knowing
that
some
of
them
and
the
worst
of
them
came
quickly
to
their
just
reward
xiii
a
month
later
july
a
halt
was
made
in
the
mouth
of
strait
to
search
for
fowle
for
food
on
the
homeward
voyage
there
savages
were
encountered
seemingly
of
so
friendly
a
nature
that
on
the
day
following
the
first
meeting
with
them
a
boat
crew
of
which
prickett
was
one
went
ashore
unarmed
then
came
a
sudden
attack
prickett
himself
was
set
upon
in
the
boat
of
which
being
lame
he
had
been
left
keeper
by
a
savage
whom
he
managed
to
kill
what
happened
to
the
others
he
thus
tells
whiles
i
was
thus
assaulted
in
the
boat
our
men
were
set
upon
on
the
shoare
john
thomas
and
william
wilson
had
their
bowels
cut
and
michael
perse
and
henry
greene
being
mortally
wounded
came
tumbling
into
the
boat
together
when
andrew
moter
saw
this
medley
hee
came
running
downe
the
rockes
and
leaped
into
the
sea
and
so
swamme
to
the
boat
hanging
on
the
sterne
thereof
till
michael
perse
took
him
in
who
manfully
made
good
the
head
of
the
boat
against
the
savages
that
pressed
sore
upon
us
now
michael
perse
had
got
an
hatchet
wherewith
i
saw
him
strike
one
of
them
that
he
lay
sprawling
in
the
sea
henry
greene
crieth
and
layeth
about
him
with
his
truncheon
i
cryed
to
them
to
cleere
the
boat
and
andrew
moter
cryed
to
bee
taken
in
the
savages
betooke
them
to
their
bowes
and
arrowes
which
they
sent
amongst
us
wherewith
henry
greene
was
slaine
and
michael
perse
received
many
wounds
and
so
did
the
rest
michael
perse
cleereth
unfastened
the
boate
and
puts
it
from
the
shoare
and
helpeth
andrew
moter
in
but
in
turning
of
the
boat
i
received
a
cruell
wound
in
my
backe
with
an
arrow
michael
perse
and
andrew
moter
rowed
the
boate
away
which
when
the
savages
saw
they
ranne
to
their
boats
and
i
feared
they
would
have
launched
them
to
have
followed
us
but
they
did
not
and
our
ship
was
in
the
middle
of
the
channel
and
could
not
see
us
now
when
they
had
rowed
a
good
way
from
the
shoare
michael
perse
fainted
and
could
row
no
more
then
was
andrew
moter
driven
to
stand
in
the
boat
head
and
waft
to
the
ship
which
at
first
saw
us
not
and
when
they
did
they
could

henry

was

out

into

and
the
rest
were
had
aboard
the

with
whom
prickett
had
fought
being
yet
alive
yet
without

they
died
all
there
that
day
william
wilson
swearing
and
cursing
in
most
fearefull
manner
michael
perse
lived
two
dayes
after
and
then
died
thus
you
have
heard
the
tragicall
end
of
henry

his
mates
whom
they
called

glad
that

a
cruell
wound
in

backe
were
it
not
that
by
the
killing
of
him
we
should
have
lost
his
narrative
i
should
wish
that
that
weak
villain
had
been
killed
along
with
the

ones
they
were
strong
it
was
a
brave
fight
that
they
made

was
worthy
of
the
lips
of

man
but
he
and

others
eminently
deserved
the
death
that
the
savages
gave
them
and
it
is
good
to
know
that
hudson

so
soon
was
avenged

equally
exemplary
punishment
equally
deserved
came
a

xiv
hudson
has
no
cause
to
quarrel
with
the
rating
that
has
been
fixed
for
him
in
the
eternal
balances
all
that
he
lost
or
seemed
to
lose
in
life
has
been
more
than
made
good
to
him
in
the
flowing
of
the
years
since
he
fought
out
with
fate
his
last
losing
round
in
his
river
and
strait
and
bay
he
has
such
monuments
set
up
before
the
whole
world
as
have
been
awarded
to
only
one
other
navigator
and
they
are
his
justly
before
his
time
those
great
waterways
and
that
great
inland
sea
were
mere
hazy
geographical
concepts
after
his
time
they
were
clearly
defined
geographical
facts
he
did
and
those
who
had
seen
them
before
him
did
not
make
them
effectively
known
here
in
this
city
of
new
york
which
owes
to
him
its
being
he
has
a
monument
of
a
different
and
of
a
nobler
sort
here
assuredly
down
through
the
coming
ages
his
memory
will
be
honored
actively
his
name
will
be
in
men
mouths
ceaselessly
so
long
as
the
city
shall
endure
and
i
hold
that
hudson
fame
as
a
most
brave
explorer
and
as
a
great
discoverer
is
not
dimmed
by
the
fact
that
up
to
a
certain
point
he
followed
in
other
men
footsteps
nor
do
i
think
that
his
glory
is
lessened
by
his
seeming
predestination
to
go
on
fixed
lines
to
a
fixed
end
on
the
contrary
i
think
that
his
fame
is
brightened
by
his
willingness
to
follow
that
he
might
as
he
did
surpass
his
predecessors
and
that
his
glory
is
increased
by
the
resolute
firmness
with
which
he
played
up
to
his
destiny
holding
fast
to
his
great
purpose
to
find
a
passage
to
the
east
by
the
north
he
compelled
every
one
of
fate
deals
against
him
until
that
last
deal
to
turn
in
his
favor
and
even
in
that
last
deal
he
won
a
death
so
heroically
woful
that
exalted
pity
for
him
almost
as
much
as
admiration
for
his
great
achievements
has
kept
his
fame
through

centuries

splendidly
alive
documents

of

of
the

came
upon

hudson

on
his

also
sailed
in

of

the
murder
of

note
the
varying
spelling
most
obvious
in
proper
names
follows
that
of
the
documents
as
i
have
stated
elsewhere
none
of
the
historians
who
has
dealt
with
matters
relating
to
hudson
has
told
what
became
of
his
murderers
when
they
returned
to
england
hessel
gerritz
alone
has
given
the
information
two
years
after
the
event
that
they
were
to
be
put
on
trial
whether
they
were
or
were
not
put
on
trial
has
remained
unknown
any
one
who
has
engaged
in
the
fascinating
pursuit
of
elusive
historical
truth
will
understand
therefore
my
warm
delight
and
my
warm
gratitude
to
marsden
when
this
clew
to
hitherto
unpublished
facts
concerning
hudson
was
placed
in
my
hands
following
it
has
not
led
me
so
far
as
in
my
first
enthusiasm
i
hoped
that
it
would
lead
me
the
search
that
i
have
caused
to
be
made
in
the
record
office
in
london
has
not
brought
to
light
even
all
of
the
documents
referred
to
by
marsden
the
record
of
the
trial
is
incomplete
and
most
regrettably
the
most
essential
of
all
the
documents
is
lacking
the
judgment
of
the
court
so
far
as
the
mutineers
are
concerned
all
that
these
documents
prove
is
that
they
actually
were
brought
to
trial
what
penalty
was
put
upon
them
or
if
any
penalty
was
put
upon
them
still
remains
unknown
but
in
another
way
these
documents
do
possess
a
high
value
and
are
of
an
exceptional
interest
in
that
they
exhibit
the
sworn
testimony
of
six
to
the
fact
as
to
the
circumstances
of
hudson
five
of
these
witnesses
now
are
produced
in
print
for
the
first
time
the
sixth
abacuck
prickett
was
the
author
of
the
larger
discourse
that
hitherto
has
been
the
sole
source
of
information
concerning
the
final
mutiny
on
board
the
discovery
that
prickett
sworn
testimony
and
unsworn
narrative
substantially
are
in
agreement
as
they
are
is
not
surprising
nor
does
such
agreement
appreciably
affect
the
truth
of
either
of
them
sworn
or
unsworn
prickett
was
not
a
person
from
whom
pure
truth
could
be
expected
when
as
in
this
case
he
was
trying
to
tell
a
story
that
would
save
him
from
being
hanged
neither
is
the
corroboration
of
prickett
story
by
the
five
newly
produced
witnesses
they
equally
being
in
danger
of
hanging
in
itself
convincing
but
certain
of
the
details
the
door
between
hudson
cabin
and
the
hold
brought
out
in
this
new
testimony
together
with
the
way
in
which
it
all
hangs
together
does
raise
the
probability
that
the
crew
of
the
discovery
had
more
than
a
colorable
grievance
against
hudson
and
does
imply
that
obviously
biased
narrative
may
be
less
far
from
the
truth
than
heretofore
it
has
been
held
to
be
the
summing
up
of
the
trinity
house
examination
gives
the
crux
of
the
matter
they
all
charge
the
master
with
wasting
filching
the
victuals
by
a
scuttle
made
out
of
his
cabin
into
the
hold
and
it
appears
that
he
fed
his
favorites
as
the
surgeon
and
kept
others
at
ordinary
allowance
all
say
that
to
save
some
from
starving
they
were
content
to
put
away
abandon
so
many
it
was
from
this
presentment
that
the
elder
brethren
drew
the
just
conclusion
as
we
know
from
prickett
characteristic
denial
under
oath
that
he
ever
knew
or
heard
such
expression
of
their
opinion
that
they
deserved
to
be
hanged
for
the
same
in
the
testimony
of
edward
wilson
the
surgeon
one
of
the
favorites
the
point
is
made
credited
to
staffe
that
the
reason
why
the
master
should
soe
favour
to
give
meate
to
some
of
the
companie
and
not
the
rest
was
because
it
was
necessary
that
some
of
them
should
be
kepte
upp
in
other
words
that
some
members
of
the
crew
without
regard
to
the
needs
of
the
remainder
should
receive
food
enough
to
give
them
strength
to
work
the
ship
this
is
an
agreement
substantially
with
the
charge
preferred
against
hudson
in
the
larger
discourse
upon
which
asher
made
the
exculpating
comment
but
even
if
this
charge
be
a
true
one
hudson
motives
were
certainly
honorable
with
such
men
as
he
had
under
his
orders
it
was
dangerous
to
deal
openly
their
crime
had
no
other
cause
than
the
fear
that
he
would
continue
his
search
and
expose
them
to
new
privations
and
it
seems
that
in
providing
for
this
emergency
he
had
even
increased
his
dangers
excuse
i
should
add
refers
more
to
concealment
of
food
than
to
unfair
apportionment
i
have
no
desire
to
play
the
part
of
devil
advocate
but
in
the
guise
of
that
personage
under
his
more
respectable
title
of
promotor
fidei
it
is
my
duty
to
point
out
that
if
hudson
deliberately
did
keep
up
himself
and
a
favored
few
by
putting
the
remainder
on
starvation
rations
no
matter
what
may
have
been
his
motives
he
exceeded
his
right
over
his
crew
of
life
and
death
his
doing
so
if
he
did
do
so
did
not
justify
mutiny
mutiny
is
a
that
no
provocation
justifies
but
if
the
point
at
issue
was
who
should
die
of
hunger
that
the
others
should
have
food
enough
to
keep
them
alive
then
the
mutineers
could
claim
and
this
is
what
virtually
they
did
claim
in
making
their
defence
that
they
did
by
the
master
in
a
swift
and
bold
way
precisely
what
in
a
slow
and
underhand
way
he
was
doing
by
them
in
the
more
agreeable
rôle
of
postulator
i
may
add
that
this
charge
against
hudson
while
not
disproved
is
not
sustained
the
one
witness
robert
byleth
of
whom
reputable
record
survives
the
only
witness
indeed
of
whom
we
have
any
record
whatever
beyond
that
of
the
case
in
hand
did
not
even
refer
to
it
in
his
admiralty
court
examination
he
is
not
included
in
the
record
of
those
examined
at
the
trinity
house
he
said
no
more
than
that
the
discontent
of
the
crew
was
by
occasion
of
the
want
of
victualls
neither
in
his
statement
in
chief
nor
in
his
did
he
charge
hudson
with
of
any
kind
byleth
himself
does
not
seem
to
have
been
looked
upon
as
a
criminal
as
is
implied
by
his
being
sent
with
captain
button
on
the
exploring
expedition
toward
the
northwest
that
was
directed
to
search
for
hudson
by
his
sailing
two
voyages
with
baffin
and
still
more
strongly
by
the
fact
that
he
was
employed
on
each
of
these
occasions
by
the
very
persons
members
of
the
muscovy
company
and
others
who
most
would
have
desired
to
punish
him
had
they
believed
that
punishment
was
his
just
desert
that
he
did
not
testify
against
hudson
must
count
therefore
as
a
strong
point
in
hudson
favor
so
strong
his
credibility
and
theirs
being
considered
comparatively
that
it
goes
far
toward
offsetting
the
testimony
of
the
haberdasher
and
the
and
the
common
sailors
by
whom
hudson
was
accused
but
it
is
useless
to
try
to
draw
substantial
conclusions
from
these
fragmentary
records
the
most
that
can
be
deduced
from
them
and
even
that
because
of
byleth
silence
hesitantly
is
that
in
a
general
way
they
do
tend
to
confirm
prickett
narrative
they
would
be
more
to
my
liking
if
this
were
not
the
case
a
curious
feature
of
the
trial
of
the
mutineers
is
its
long
delay
more
than
five
years
the
trinity
house
authorities
acted
promptly
almost
immediately
upon
the
return
to
london
of
the
eight
survivors
of
the
discovery
five
of
them
prickett
wilson
clemens
motter
and
mathews
no
mention
is
made
in
the
record
of
byleth
bond
and
the
boy
syms
were
brought
before
the
masters
october
for
examination
in
a
single
day
their
examination
was
concluded
with
the
resulting
verdict
of
the
masters
upon
their
actions
that
they
deserved
to
be
hanged
for
the
same
three
months
later
january
the
matter
was
before
the
instance
and
prize
records
division
of
the
high
court
of
admiralty
of
which
hearing
the
only
recorded
result
is
the
examination
of
the
edward
wilson
then
apparently
the
mutineers
were
left
to
their
own
devices
for
five
full
years
so
far
as
the
records
show
no
action
was
taken
until
the
trial
began
in
oyer
and
terminer
the
date
of
that
beginning
can
not
be
fixed
precisely
there
being
no
date
attached
to
the
true
bill
found
against
bileth
prickett
wilson
motter
bond
and
sims
for
some
unknown
reason
mathews
and
clemens
were
not
included
in
the
indictment
although
clemens
certainly
was
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
the
date
may
be
fixed
very
closely
however
by
the
fact
that
the
two
most
important
witnesses
prickett
and
byleth
were
examined
on
february
three
months
later
may
clemens
was
examined
and
that
is
all
there
in
the
very
middle
of
the
trial
leaving
in
the
air
the
examinations
of
the
other
witnesses
and
the
judgments
of
the
court
the
records
end
had
document
no
of
the
oyer
and
terminer
series
been
found
some
explanation
of
the
five
years
delay
of
the
trial
might
have
been
forthcoming
and
the
exact
date
of
its
beginning
probably
would
have
been
fixed
as
the
records
stand
they
leave
us
so
far
as
the
trial
is
concerned
with
a
series
of
increasingly
disappointing
negatives
we
do
not
know
why
two
of
the
crew
one
of
them
certainly
within
reach
of
the
court
were
not
included
in
the
indictment
nor
why
the
trial
was
postponed
for
so
long
a
time
nor
certainly
when
it
ended
nor
worst
of
all
what
was
its
result
i
should
be
glad
to
believe
that
the
mutineers
even
including
byleth
who
was
the
best
of
them
came
to
the
hanging
that
the
elder
brethren
of
the
trinity
in
their
just
judgment
declared
that
they
deserved
if
they
did
there
is
no
known
record
of
their
hanging
a
curiously
suggestive
interest
however
attaches
to
the
fact
that
at
just
about
the
time
when
the
trial
ended
one
of
them
and
the
only
conspicuous
one
of
them
seems
permanently
to
have
disappeared
that
most
careful
investigator
the
late
alexander
brown
was
unable
to
find
any
sure
trace
of
byleth
after
his
second
voyage
with
baffin
which
was
made
in
seven
months
later
as
the
subjoined
records
prove
he
was
on
trial
for
his
life
it
seems
to
me
to
be
at
least
a
possibility
that
the

nothing

till
he

him
pinioned
down

francis

and
bennet
mathues
say
the
master
was
put
out
of
the
ship
by
the
consent
of
all
that
were
in
health
in
regard
that
their
victualls
were
much
wasted
by
him
some
of
those
that
were
put
away
were
directly
against
the
master
and
yet
for
safety
of
the
rest
put
away
with
him
and
all
by
those
men
that
were
slain
principally
they
all
charge
the
master
with
wasting
the
victuals
by
a
scuttle
made
out
of
his
cabin
into
the
hold
and
it
appears
that
he
fed
his
favourites
as
the
surgeon
and
kept
others
at
only
ordinary
allowance
all
say
that
to
save
some
from
starving
they
were
content
to
put
away
so
many
and
that
to
most
of
them
it
was
utterly
unknown
who
should
go

and
the

in

in
the
month
of

in

what
became
of
them
he
knows
not
he
was
lame
in
his
legs
at
the
time
and
unable
to
stand
he
greatly
lamented
the
deed
and
had
no

in

hudson
and
staffe
were
the
best
friends
he

grene

and
all
of

sore
wounded
yet
recovered
the
boat
before
they
died
grene
coming
into
the
boat
died
presently
wilson
thomas
and
pearse
were
taken
into
the
ship
and
died
a
few
hours
afterwards
two
of
them
having
had
their
bowels
cut
out
the
blood
upon
the
clothes
brought
home
was
the
blood
of
these
persons
so
wounded
and
slain
by
the
savages
and
no
other
there
was
falling
out
between
grene
and
hudson
the
master
and
between
wilson
the
surgeon
and
hudson
and
between
staffe
and
hudson
but
no
mutiny
was
in
question
until
of
a
sudden
the
said
grene
and
his
consorts
forced
the
said
hudson
and
the
rest
into
the
shallop
and
left
them
in
the
ice
the
chests
of
hudson
and
the
rest
were
opened
and
their
clothes
and
such
things
as
they
had
inventoried
and
sold
by
grene
and
the
others
and
some
of
the
clothes
were
worn
thomas
widowes
was
thrust
out
of
the
ship
into
the
shallop
but
whether
he
willed
them
take
his
keys
and
share
his
goods
to
save
his
life
this
examinate
knoweth
not
at
the
putting
out
of
the
men
the
ship
carpenter
staffe
asked
the
company
if
they
would
be
wished
to
be
hanged
when
they
came
to
england
he
does
not
know
whether
the
carpenter
is
dead
or
alive
for
he
never
saw
him
since
he
was
put
out
into
the
shallop
no
shot
was
made
at
hudson
or
any
of
them
nor
any
hurt
done
them
that
he
knows
he
did
not
see
hudson
bound
but
heard
that
wilson
pinioned
his
arms
when
he
was
put
into
the
shallop
but
when
he
was
in
the
shallop
this
examinate
saw
him
in
a
motley
gown
at
liberty
and
they
spoke
together
hudson
saying
it
is
that
villain
ivott
juet
that
hath
undone
us
and
he
answered
no
it
is
grene
that
hath
done
all
this
villainy
it
is
true
that
grene
wilson
and
thomas
had
consultation
together
to
turn
pirates
and
so
he
thinks
they
would
have
done
had
they
not
been
slain
there
was
no
watchword
given
but
grene
wilson
thomas
and
bennett
watched
the
master
when
he
came
out
of
his
cabin
and
forced
him
over
board
into
the
shallop
and
then
they
put
out
the
rest
being
sick
men
he
told
sir
thomas
smith
the
truth
as
to
how
hudson
and
the
rest
were
turned
out
of
the
ship
he
told
the
masters
of
the
the
truth
of
the
business
but
never
knew
or
heard
that
the
masters
said
they
deserved
to
be
hanged
for
the
same
they
were
not
victualled
with
rabbits
or
partridges
before
hudson
and
the
rest
were
turned
into
the
shallop
nor
after
there
was
no
mutiny
otherwise
than
as
aforesaid
they
were
turned
out
only
for
want
of
victuals
as
far
as
he
knows
he
does
not
know
the
handwriting
of
thomas
widowes
he
for
his
part
made
no
means
to
hinder
any
proceedings
that
might
have
been
taken
against
them
signed
abacooke
periket
the
same
robert
bilett
of
katherine
mariner
examined
saith
that
upon
a
discontent
amongst
the
company
of
the
ship
the
discovery
in
the
finding
out
of
the
passage
by
occasion
of
the
want
of
victualls
henry
grene
being
the
principal
together
with
john
thomas
william
wilson
robert
ivett
juet
and
michael
pearse
determined
to
shift
the
company
and
thereupon
henry
hudson
the
master
was
by
force
put
into
the
shallop
and
or
more
were
commanded
to
go
into
the
shallop
to
the
master
which
they
did
this
examinate
thinking
this
course
was
taken
only
to
search
the
master
cabin
and
the
ship
for
victualls
which
the
said
grene
and
others
thought
the
master
concealed
from
the
company
to
serve
his
own
turn
but
when
they
were
in
the
shallop
grene
and
the
rest
would
not
suffer
them
to
come
any
more
on
board
the
ship
so
hudson
and
the
rest
in
the
shallop
went
away
to
the
southward
and
the
ship
came
to
the
eastward
and
the
one
never
saw
the
other
since
what
is
otherwise
become
of
them
be
knoweth
not
he
says
that
the
men
went
ashore
as
above
to
get
victuals
and
from
their
wounds
the
cabins
beds
and
clothes
were
made
bloody
there
was
discontent
amongst
the
company
but
no
mutiny
to
his
knowledge
until
the
said
grene
and
his
associates
turned
the
master
and
the
rest
into
the
shallop
he
heard
of
no
mutiny
till
overnight
that
hudson
and
the
rest
were
to
be
put
into
the
shallop
the
next
day
and
this
examinate
and
prickett
persuaded
the
crew
to
the
contrary
and
grene
answered
the
master
was
resolved
to
overtrowe
all
and
therefore
he
and
his
friends
would
shift
for
themselves
such
clothes
as
were
left
behind
in
the
ship
by
hudson
and
his
associates
were
sold
and
worn
by
some
of
the
company
that
wanted
clothes
the
ship
carpenter
never
used
such
speeches
to
his
knowledge
this
seems
to
refer
to
staffe
question
would
they
be
hanged
when
they
came
to
england
philip
staffe
the
carpenter
went
into
the
shallop
of
his
own
accord
without
any
compulsion
whether
he
be
dead
or
alive
or
what
has
become
of
him
he
knoweth
not
no
man
either
drunk
or
sober
can
report
that
hudson
and
his
associates
were
shot
at
after
they
were
in
the
shallop
for
there
was
no
such
thing
done
he
was
under
the
deck
when
henry
hudson
was
put
out
of
the
ship
so
that
he
saw
it
not
nor
knoweth
whether
he
were
bound
or
not
but
saith
he
heard
he
was
pinioned
henry
grene
and
two
or
three
others
made
a
motion
to
turn
pirates
and
he
believes
they
would
have
done
if
they
had
lived
he
denieth
that
he
took
any
ringe
out
of
hudson
pocket
neither
ever
saw
it
except
on
his
finger
nor
knoweth
what
became
of
it
such
beds
and
clothes
as
were
left
in
the
ship
and
not
taken
by
hudson
and
the
rest
into
the
shallop
were
brought
into
england
because
they
left
them
behind
in
the
ship
there
was
no
watchword
given
but
grene
and
the
others
commanded
the
said
hudson
and
the
rest
into
the
shallop
and
upon
that
command
they
went
he
told
sir
thomas
smith
the
manner
how
hudson
and
the
rest
went
from
them
but
what
sir
thomas
said
to
their
wives
he
knoweth
not
there
was
no
mutiny
but
some
discontent
amongst
the
company
they
were
not
victualled
with
any
abundance
of
rabbits
and
partridges
all
the
voyage
he
doth
not
know
the
handwriting
of
widowes
nor
hath
he
seen
what
he
put
down
in
writing
signed
robert
byleth
admiralty
oyer
and
terminer
frances
clemence
of
wapping
mariner
aged
says
that
henry
hudson
the
master
and
persons
more

they
wintered
about

he
heard
from
the
rest
of
the
company
for
this
examinate
had
his
nails
frozen
off
and
was
very
sick
at
the
time
henry
grene
william
wilson
john
thomas
and
michael
pearse
were
slain
on
shore
by
the
savages
at
sir
dudley
digges
island
and
robert
ivett
juet
died
at
sea
after
they
were
slain
philip
staffe
the
ship
carpenter
was
one
of
them
who
were
put
into
the
shallop
with
the
master
and
the
rest
whether
he
is
dead
or
not
he
knows
not
the
master
displaced
some
of
the
crew
and
put
others
in
their
room
but
there
was
no
mutiny
that
he
knew
of
