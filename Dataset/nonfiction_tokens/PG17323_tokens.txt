the
time
when
nothing
which
was
called
heaven
existed
above
and
when
nothing
below
had
as
yet
received
the
name
of
earth
apsu
the
ocean
who
first
was
their
father
and
who
gave
birth
to
them
all
mingled
their
waters
in
one
reeds
which
were
not
united
rushes
which
bore
no
life
germinated
slowly
in
this
inert
mass
in
which
the
elements
of
our
world
lay
still
in
confusion
when
at
length
it
did
spring
up
it
was
but
feebly
and
at
rare
intervals
through
the
hatching
of
divine
couples
devoid
of
personality
and
almost
without
form
the
time
when
the
gods
were
not
created
not
one
as
yet
when
they
had
neither
been
called
by
their
names
nor
had
their
destinies
been
assigned
to
them
by
fate
gods
manifested
themselves
lakhmu
and
lakhamu
were
the
first
to
appear
and
waxed
great
for
ages
then
anshar
and
kishar
were
produced
after
them
days
were
added
to
days
and
years
were
heaped
upon
years
anu
inlil
and
ea
were
born
in
their
turn
for
anshar
and
kishar
had
given
them
as
the
generations
emanated
one
from
the
other
their
vitality
increased
and
the
personality
of
each
became
more
clearly
defined
the
last
generation
included
none
but
beings
of
an
original
character
and
clearly
marked
individuality
anu
the
sunlit
sky
by
day
the
starlit
firmament
by
night
the
king
of
the
earth
ea
the
sovereign
of
the
waters
and
the
personification
of
wisdom
each
of
them
duplicated
himself
anu
into
anat
bel
into
belit
ea
into
damkina
and
united
himself
to
the
spouse
whom
he
had
deduced
from
himself
other
divinities
sprang
from
these
fruitful
pairs
and
the
impulse
once
given
the
world
was
rapidly
peopled
by
their
descendants
sin
shamash
and
kamman
who
presided
respectively
over
the
moon
the
sun
and
the
air
were
all
three
of
equal
rank
next
came
the
lords
of
the
planets
ninib
merodach
nergal
the
ishtar
and
nebo
then
a
whole
army
of
lesser
deities
who
ranged
themselves
around
anu
as
round
a
supreme
master
tiamat
finding
her
domain
becoming
more
and
more
restricted
owing
to
the
activity
of
the
others
desired
to
raise
battalion
against
battalion
and
set
herself
to
create
unceasingly
but
her
offspring
made
in
her
own
image
appeared
like
those
incongruous
phantoms
which
men
see
in
dreams
and
which
are
made
up
of
members
borrowed
from
a
score
of
different
animals
they
appeared
in
the
form
of
bulls
with
human
heads
of
horses
with
the
snouts
of
dogs
of
dogs
with
quadruple
bodies
springing
from
a
single
tail
some
of
them
had
the
beak
of
an
eagle
or
a
hawk
others
four
wings
and
two
faces
others
the
legs
and
horns
of
a
goat
others
again
the
hind
quarters
of
a
horse
and
the
whole
body
of
a
man
tiamat
furnished
them
with
terrible
weapons
placed
them
under
the
command
of
her
husband
kingu
and
set
out
to
war
against
the
gods
in
chaldaea
as
in
egypt
nothing
was
supposed
to
have
a
real
existence
until
it
had
received
its
name
the
sentence
quoted
in
the
text
means
practically
that
at
that
time
there
was
neither
heaven
nor
earth
apsu
has
been
transliterated
kiracruv
in
greek
by
the
author
an
extract
from
whose
works
has
been
preserved
by
damascius
he
gives
a
different
version
of
the
tradition
according
to
which
the
amorphous
goddess
consisted
of
two
persons
the
first
tauthe
was
the
wife
of
apason
the
second
moymis
was
the
son
of
apason
and
of
tauthe
the
last
part
of
the
sentence
is
very
obscure
in
the
assyrian
text
and
has
been
translated
in
a
variety
of
different
ways
it
seems
to
contain
a
comparison
between
apsu
and
on
the
one
hand
and
the
reeds
and
clumps
of
rushes
so
common
in
chaldaea
on
the
other
the
two
divinities
remain
inert
and
unfruitful
like
which
have
not
yet
manifested
their
exuberant
growth
the
first
fragments
of
the
chaldaean
account
of
the
creation
were
discovered
by
smith
who
described
them
in
the
of
march
and
published
them
in
the
of
the
society
of
biblical
and
translated
in
his
chaldaean
account
of
genesis
all
the
fragments
with
which
he
was
acquainted
other
fragments
have
since
been
collected
but
unfortunately
not
enough
to
enable
us
to
entirely
reconstitute
the
legend
it
covered
at
least
six
tablets
possibly
more
portions
of
it
have
been
translated
after
smith
by
talbot
by
oppert
by
lenormant
by
schrader
by
sayce
by
jensen
by
winckler
by
zimmern
and
lastly
by
delitzsch
since
smith
wrote
chaldaean
a
fragment
of
a
different
version
has
been
considered
to
be
a
part
of
the
dogma
of
the
creation
as
it
was
put
forth
at
kutha
illustration
one
of
the
genii
drawn
by
from
an
assyrian
from
khorsabad
at
first
they
knew
not
whom
to
send
against
her
anshar
despatched
his
son
anu
but
anu
was
afraid
and
made
no
attempt
to
oppose
her
he
sent
ea
but
ea
like
anu
grew
pale
with
fear
and
did
not
venture
to
attack
her
merodach
the
son
of
ea
was
the
only
one
who
believed
himself
strong
enough
to
conquer
her
the
gods
summoned
to
a
solemn
banquet
in
the
palace
of
anshar
unanimously
chose
him
to
be
their
champion
and
proclaimed
him
king
thou
art
glorious
among
the
great
gods
thy
will
is
second
to
none
thy
bidding
is
anu
marduk
merodach
thou
art
glorious
among
the
great
gods
thy
will
is
second
to
none
thy
bidding
is
anu
from
this
day
that
which
thou
orderest
may
not
be
changed
the
power
to
raise
or
to
abase
shall
be
in
thy
hand
the
word
of
thy
mouth
shall
endure
and
thy
commandment
shall
not
meet
with
opposition
none
of
the
gods
shall
transgress
thy
law
but
wheresoever
a
sanctuary
of
the
gods
is
decorated
the
place
where
they
shall
give
their
oracles
shall
be
thy
place
marduk
it
is
thou
who
art
our
avenger
we
bestow
on
thee
the
attributes
of
a
king
the
whole
of
all
that
exists
thou
hast
it
and
everywhere
thy
word
shall
be
exalted
thy
weapons
shall
not
be
turned
aside
they
shall
strike
thy
enemy
o
master
who
trusts
in
thee
spare
thou
his
life
but
the
god
who
hath
done
evil
put
out
his
life
like
water
they
clad
their
champion
in
a
garment
and
thus
addressed
him
will
master
shall
be
that
of
the
gods
speak
the
word
it
be
so
it
shall
be
so
thus
open
thy
mouth
this
garment
shall
disappear
say
unto
it
and
the
garment
shall
be
he
spoke
with
his
lips
the
garment
disappeared
he
said
unto
it
and
the
garment
was
restored
the
assyrian
runs
destiny
is
second
to
this
refers
not
to
the
of
the
god
himself
but
to
the
fate
which
he
allots
to
others
i
have
substituted
here
and
elsewhere
for
the
word
the
special
meaning
of
which
would
not
have
been
understood
the
word
which
though
it
does
not
exactly
reproduce
the
assyrian
expression
avoids
the
necessity
for
paraphrases
or
formulas
calculated
to
puzzle
the
modern
reader
or
to
put
it
less
concisely
thou
commandest
it
is
anu
himself
who
commands
and
the
same
blind
obedience
must
be
paid
to
thee
as
to
anu
the
meaning
is
uncertain
the
sentence
seems
to
convey
that
henceforth
merodach
would
be
at
home
in
all
temples
that
were
constructed
in
honour
of
the
other
gods
merodach
having
been
once
convinced
by
this
evidence
that
he
had
the
power
of
doing
everything
and
of
undoing
everything
at
his
pleasure
the
gods
handed
to
him
the
sceptre
the
throne
the
crown
the
insignia
of
supreme
rule
and
greeted
him
with
their
acclamations
king
go
cut
short
the
life
of
tiamat
and
let
the
wind
carry
her
blood
to
the
hidden
extremities
of
the
he
equipped
himself
carefully
for
the
struggle
made
a
bow
and
placed
his
mark
upon
it
he
had
a
spear
brought
to
him
and
fitted
a
point
to
it
the
god
lifted
the
lance
brandished
it
in
his
right
hand
then
hung
the
bow
and
quiver
at
his
side
he
placed
a
thunderbolt
before
him
filled
his
body
with
a
devouring
flame
then
made
a
net
in
which
to
catch
the
anarchic
tiamat
he
placed
the
four
winds
in
such
a
way
that
she
could
not
escape
south
and
north
east
and
west
and
with
his
own
hand
he
brought
them
the
net
the
gift
of
his
father
anu
created
the
hurricane
the
evil
wind
the
storm
the
tempest
the
four
winds
the
seven
winds
the
waterspout
the
wind
that
is
second
to
none
then
he
let
loose
the
winds
he
had
created
all
seven
of
them
in
order
to
bewilder
the
anarchic
tiamat
by
charging
behind
her
and
the
master
of
the
waterspout
raised
his
mighty
weapon
he
mounted
his
chariot
a
work
without
its
equal
formidable
he
installed
himself
therein
tied
the
four
reins
to
the
side
and
darted
forth
pitiless
sayce
was
the
first
i
believe
to
cite
in
connection
with
this
mysterious
order
the
passage
in
which
berossus
tells
how
the
gods
created
men
from
a
little
clay
moistened
with
the
blood
of
the
god
belos
here
there
seems
to
be
a
fear
lest
the
blood
of
tiamat
mingling
with
the
mud
should
produce
a
crop
of
monsters
similar
to
those
which
the
goddess
had
already
created
the
blood
if
carried
to
the
north
into
the
domain
of
the
night
would
there
lose
its
creative
power
or
the
monsters
who
might
spring
from
it
would
at
any
rate
remain
strangers
to
the
world
of
gods
and
men
he
made
his
weapon
known
it
would
be
better
to
interpret
it
he
made
it
known
that
the
bow
would
henceforth
be
his
distinctive
illustration
armed
with
the
thunderbolt
does
battle
with
the
tumultuous
tiamat
drawn
by
from
the
from
nimrud
preserved
in
the
british
museum
he
passed
through
the
serried
ranks
of
the
monsters
and
penetrated
as
far
as
tiamat
and
provoked
her
with
his
cries
hast
rebelled
against
the
sovereignty
of
the
gods
thou
hast
plotted
evil
against
them
and
hast
desired
that
my
fathers
should
taste
of
thy
malevolence
therefore
thy
host
shall
be
reduced
to
slavery
thy
weapons
shall
be
torn
from
thee
come
then
thou
and
i
must
give
battle
to
one
another
tiamat
when
she
heard
him
flew
into
a
fury
she
became
mad
with
rage
then
tiamat
howled
she
raised
herself
savagely
to
her
full
height
and
planted
her
feet
firmly
on
the
earth
she
pronounced
an
incantation
recited
her
formula
and
called
to
her
aid
the
gods
of
the
combat
both
them
and
their
weapons
they
drew
near
one
to
another
tiamat
and
marduk
wisest
of
the
gods
they
flung
themselves
into
the
combat
they
met
one
another
in
the
struggle
then
the
master
unfolded
his
net
and
seized
her
he
caused
the
hurricane
which
waited
behind
him
to
pass
in
front
of
him
and
when
tiamat
opened
her
mouth
to
swallow
him
he
thrust
the
hurricane
into
it
so
that
the
monster
could
not
close
her
jaws
again
the
mighty
wind
filled
her
paunch
her
breast
swelled
her
maw
was
split
marduk
gave
a
straight
thrust
with
his
lance
burst
open
the
paunch
pierced
the
interior
tore
the
breast
then
bound
the
monster
and
deprived
her
of
life
when
he
had
vanquished
tiamat
who
had
been
their
leader
her
army
was
disbanded
her
host
was
scattered
and
the
gods
her
allies
who
had
marched
beside
her
trembled
were
scared
and
he
seized
hold
of
them
and
of
kingu
their
chief
and
brought
them
bound
in
chains
before
the
throne
of
his
father
he
had
saved
the
gods
from
ruin
but
this
was
the
least
part
of
his
task
he
had
still
to
sweep
out
of
space
the
huge
carcase
which
encumbered
it
and
to
separate
its
elements
and
arrange
them
afresh
for
the
benefit
of
the
conquerors
he
returned
to
tiamat
whom
he
had
bound
in
chains
he
placed
his
foot
upon
her
with
his
unerring
knife
he
cut
into
the
upper
part
of
her
then
he
cut
the
and
caused
the
blood
to
be
carried
by
the
north
wind
to
the
hidden
places
and
the
gods
saw
his
face
they
rejoiced
they
gave
themselves
up
to
gladness
and
sent
him
a
present
a
tribute
of
peace
then
he
recovered
his
calm
he
contemplated
the
corpse
raised
it
and
wrought
marvels
illustration
a
kufa
laden
with
stones
and
manned
by
a
crew
of
four
men
drawn
by
from
a
at
koyunjik
behind
the
may
be
seen
a
fisherman
seated
astride
on
an
inflated
skin
with
his
attached
to
his
neck
he
split
it
in
two
as
one
does
a
fish
for
drying
then
he
hung
up
one
of
the
halves
on
high
which
became
the
heavens
the
other
half
he
spread
out
under
his
feet
to
form
the
earth
and
made
the
universe
such
as
men
have
since
known
it
as
in
egypt
the
world
was
a
kind
of
enclosed
chamber
balanced
on
the
bosom
of
the
eternal
waters
the
earth
which
forms
the
lower
part
of
it
or
floor
is
something
like
an
overturned
boat
in
appearance
and
hollow
underneath
not
like
one
of
the
narrow
skiffs
in
use
among
other
races
but
a
kufa
or
kind
of
semicircular
boat
such
as
the
tribes
of
the
lower
euphrates
have
made
use
of
from
earliest
antiquity
down
to
our
own
times
the
description
of
the
egyptian
world
will
be
found
in
vol
of
the
present
work
so
far
the
only
systematic
attempt
to
reconstruct
the
chaldaean
world
since
lenormant
has
been
made
by
jensen
who
after
examining
all
the
elements
which
went
to
compose
it
one
after
another
sums
up
in
a
few
pages
and
reproduces
in
a
plate
the
principal
results
of
his
inquiry
it
will
be
seen
at
a
glance
how
much
i
have
taken
from
his
work
and
in
what
respects
the
drawing
here
reproduced
differs
from
his
illustration
the
world
as
conceived
by
the
chaldaeans
the
earth
rises
gradually
from
the
extremities
to
the
centre
like
a
great
mountain
of
which
the
where
the
euphrates
finds
its
source
approximately
marks
the
summit
it
was
at
first
supposed
to
be
divided
into
seven
zones
placed
one
on
the
top
of
the
other
along
its
sides
like
the
stories
of
a
temple
later
on
it
was
divided
into
four
each
of
which
like
the
of
egypt
corresponded
with
one
of
the
four
cardinal
points
and
was
under
the
rule
of
particular
gods
near
the
foot
of
the
mountain
the
edges
of
the
boat
curve
abruptly
outwards
and
surround
the
earth
with
a
continuous
wall
of
uniform
height
having
no
opening
the
waters
accumulated
in
the
hollow
thus
formed
as
in
a
ditch
it
was
a
narrow
and
mysterious
sea
an
ocean
stream
which
no
living
man
might
cross
save
with
permission
from
on
high
and
whose
waves
rigorously
separated
the
domain
of
men
from
the
regions
reserved
to
the
gods
the
heavens
rose
above
the
of
the
like
a
boldly
formed
dome
the
circumference
of
which
rested
on
the
top
of
the
wall
in
the
same
way
as
the
upper
structures
of
a
house
rest
on
its
foundations
merodach
wrought
it
out

jensen
has
made
a
collection
of
the
texts
which
speak
of
the
interior
of
the
heavens
kirib
shami
and
of
their
aspect
the
expressions
which
have
induced
many
assyriologists
to
conclude
that
the
heavens
were
divided
into
different
parts
subject
to
different
gods
may
be
explained
without
necessarily
having
recourse
to
this
hypothesis
the
of
ami
for
instance
is
an
expression
which
merely
affirms
sovereignty
in
the
heavens
and
is
only
a
more
elegant
way
of
designating
the
heavens
by
the
name
of
the
god
who
rules
them
the
gates
of
heaven
are
mentioned
in
the
account
of
the
creation
it
is
generally
admitted
that
the
chaldaeans
believed
that
the
sun
passed
over
the
world
in
the
daytime
and
underneath
it
during
the
night
the
general
resemblance
of
their
theory
of
the
universe
to
the
egyptian
theory
leads
me
to
believe
that
they
no
less
than
the
egyptians
cf
vol
pp
of
the
present
work
for
along
time
believed
that
the
sun
and
moon
revolved
round
the
earth
in
a
horizontal
plane
this
obscure
phrase
seems
to
be
explained
if
we
remember
that
the
chaldaean
like
the
egyptian
day
dated
from
the
rising
of
one
moon
to
the
rising
of
the
following
moon
for
instance
from
six
one
evening
to
about
six
the
next
evening
the
moon
the
star
of
night
thus
marks
the
appearance
of
each
day
and
the
the
word
here
translated
by
is
literally
the
royal
cap
decorated
with
horns
which
sin
the
god
wears
on
his
head
the
heavens
having
been
put
in
order
he
set
about
peopling
the
earth
and
the
gods
who
had
so
far
passively
and
perhaps
powerlessly
watched
him
at
his
work
at
length
made
up
their
minds
to
assist
him
they
covered
the
soil
with
verdure
and
all
collectively
living
beings
of
many
kinds
the
cattle
of
the
fields
the
wild
beasts
of
the
fields
the
reptiles
of
the
fields
they
fashioned
them
and
made
of
them
creatures
of
according
to
one
legend
these
first
animals
had
hardly
left
the
hands
of
their
creators
when
not
being
able
to
withstand
the
glare
of
the
light
they
fell
dead
one
after
the
other
then
merodach
seeing
that
the
earth
was
again
becoming
desolate
and
that
its
fertility
was
of
no
use
to
any
one
begged
his
father
ea
to
cut
off
his
head
and
mix
clay
with
the
blood
which
welled
from
the
trunk
then
from
this
clay
to
fashion
new
beasts
and
men
to
whom
the
virtues
of
this
divine
blood
would
give
the
necessary
strength
to
enable
them
to
resist
the
air
and
light
at
first
they
led
a
somewhat
wretched
existence
and
without
rule
after
the
manner
of
beasts
but
in
the
first
year
appeared
a
monster
endowed
with
human
reason
named
oannes
who
rose
from
out
of
the
erythraean
sea
at
the
point
where
it
borders
babylonia
he
had
the
whole
body
of
a
fish
but
above
his
head
he
had
another
head
which
was
that
of
a
man
and
human
feet
emerged
from
beneath
his
tail
he
had
a
human
voice
and
his
image
is
preserved
to
this
day
he
passed
the
day
in
the
midst
of
men
without
taking
any
food
he
taught
them
the
use
of
letters
sciences
and
arts
of
all
kinds
the
rules
for
the
founding
of
cities
and
the
construction
of
temples
the
principles
of
law
and
of
surveying
he
showed
them
how
to
sow
and
reap
he
gave
them
all
that
contributes
to
the
comforts
of
life
since
that
time
nothing
excellent
has
been
invented
at
sunset
this
monster
oannes
plunged
back
into
the
sea
and
remained
all
night
beneath
the
waves
for
he
was
amphibious
he
wrote
a
book
on
the
origin
of
things
and
of
civilization
which
he
gave
to
these
are
a
few
of
the
fables
which
were
current
among
the
races
of
the
lower
euphrates
with
regard
to
the
first
beginnings
of
the
universe
that
they
possessed
many
other
legends
of
which
we
now
know
nothing
is
certain
but
either
they
have
perished
for
ever
or
the
works
in
which
they
were
recorded
still
await
discovery
it
may
be
under
the
ruins
of
a
palace
or
in
the
cupboards
of
some
museum
the
arrangement
of
the
heavens
by
merodach
is
described
at
the
end
of
the
fourth
and
beginning
of
the
fifth
tablets
the
text
originally
somewhat
obscure
is
so
mutilated
in
places
that
it
is
not
always
possible
to
make
out
the
sense
with
certainty
the
creation
of
the
animals
and
then
of
man
is
related
on
the
seventh
tablet
and
on
a
tablet
the
place
of
which
in
the
series
is
still
undetermined
i
have
been
obliged
to
translate
the
text
rather
freely
so
as
to
make
the
meaning
clear
to
the
modern
reader
illustration
a
drawn
by
from
an
assyrian
from
nimrud
they
do
not
seem
to
have
conceived
the
possibility
of
an
absolute
creation
by
means
of
which
the
gods
or
one
of
them
should
have
evolved
out
of
nothing
all
that
exists
the
creation
was
for
them
merely
the
setting
in
motion
of
elements
and
the
creator
only
an
organizer
of
the
various
materials
floating
in
chaos
popular
fancy
in
different
towns
varied
the
names
of
the
creators
and
the
methods
employed
by
them
as
centuries
passed
on
a
pile
of
vague
confused
and
contradictory
traditions
were
amassed
no
one
of
which
was
held
to
be
quite
satisfactory
though
all
found
partisans
to
support
them
just
as
in
egypt
the
theologians
of
local
priesthoods
endeavoured
to
classify
them
and
bring
them
into
a
kind
of
harmony
many
they
rejected
and
others
they
recast
in
order
to
better
reconcile
their
statements
they
arranged
them
in
systems
from
which
they
undertook
to
unravel
under
inspiration
from
on
high
the
true
history
of
the
universe
that
which
i
have
tried
to
set
forth
above
is
very
ancient
if
as
is
said
to
be
the
case
it
was
in
existence
two
or
even
three
thousand
years
before
our
era
but
the
versions
of
it
which
we
possess
were
drawn
up
much
later
perhaps
not
till
about
the
viith
century
it
had
been
accepted
by
the
inhabitants
of
babylon
because
it
flattered
their
religious
vanity
by
attributing
the
credit
of
having
evolved
order
out
of
chaos
to
merodach
the
protector
of
their
city
he
it
was
whom
the
assyrian
scribes
had
raised
to
a
position
of
honour
at
the
court
of
the
last
kings
of
nineveh
it
was
name
which
berossus
inscribed
at
the
beginning
of
his
book
when
he
set
about
relating
to
the
greeks
the
origin
of
the
world
according
to
the
chaldeans
and
the
dawn
of
babylonian
civilization
the
question
as
to
whether
the
text
was
originally
written
in
sumerian
or
in
the
semitic
tongue
has
frequently
been
discussed
the
form
in
which
we
have
it
at
present
is
not
very
old
and
does
not
date
much
further
back
than
the
reign
of
assurbanipal
if
it
is
not
even
contemporary
with
that
monarch
according
to
sayce
the
first
version
would
date
back
beyond
the
xxth
century
to
the
reign
of
khammurabi
according
to
jensen
beyond
the
xxxth
century
before
our
era
sayce
thinks
that
the
myth
originated
at
eridu
on
the
shores
of
the
persian
gulf
and
afterwards
received
its
present
form
at
babylon
where
the
local
schools
of
theology
adapted
it
to
the
god
merodach
the
tablets
in
which
it
is
preserved
for
us
come
partly
from
the
library
of
assurbanipal
at
nineveh
partly
from
that
of
the
temple
of
nebo
at
borsippa
these
latter
are
more
recent
than
the
others
and
seem
to
have
been
written
during
the
period
of
the
persian
supremacy
like
the
egyptian
civilization
it
had
had
its
birth
between
the
sea
and
the
dry
land
on
a
low
marshy
alluvial
soil
flooded
annually
by
the
rivers
which
traverse
it
devastated
at
long
intervals
by
tidal
waves
of
extraordinary
violence
the
euphrates
and
the
tigris
can
not
be
regarded
as
mysterious
streams
like
the
nile
whose
source
so
long
defied
exploration
that
people
were
tempted
to
place
it
beyond
the
regions
inhabited
by
man
the

in
armenia
on
the
slopes
of
the
niphates
one
of
the
chains
of

and
mesopotamia
and

at
certain
points
reaches

makes
its
way
across

by
the
shortest
route
but
it
soon
alters
its
intention

in
an
oblique
direction
towards
the
south
from
the
point
where
the

open
out
and
gradually
approaches
the
euphrates
near
bagdad
the
two

are
only
a

leagues
apart
however
they
do
not
yet
blend
their
waters
after
proceeding

by

for
some
twenty
or
thirty
miles
they
again
separate
and
only
finally
unite
at
a
point
some
eighty
leagues
lower
down
at
the
beginning
of
our
geological
period
their
course
was
not
such
a
long
one
the
sea
then
penetrated
as
far
as
lat
and
was
only
arrested
by
the
last
undulations
of
the
great
plateau
of
secondary
formation
which
descend
from
the
mountain
group
of
armenia
the
two
rivers
entered
the
sea
at
a
distance
of
about
twenty
leagues
apart
falling
into

gulf
bounded
on

by

spurs
of
the
mountains
of

on

west
by
the
sandy
heights
which
border

they
filled
up
this

with
their
alluvial
deposit
aided
by
the
adhem
the
diyaleh
the
kerkha
the
karun
and
other
rivers
which
at
the
end
of
long
independent
courses
became

of
the
two
rivers
connected
by
numerous
canals
at

the

with
which
they
are
charged
is
deposited
when

said
that
the

advances
about
a
mile
every
seventy
years
in
its
upper
reaches
the

a
number
of
small

both
of

almost

does
not
possess
the
same
importance
for
the
regions
covered
by
it
that
the
rise
of
the
nile
does
for
egypt
in
fact
it
does
more
harm
than
good
and
the
population
have
always
worked
hard
to
protect
themselves
from
it
and
to
keep
it
away
from
their
lands
rather
than
facilitate
its
access
to
them
they
regard
it
as
a
sort
of
necessary
evil
to
which
they
resign
themselves
while
trying
to
minimize
its
effects
this
fact
has
been
established
by
ross
and
lynch
in
two
articles
in
the
of
the
royal
geographical
vol
ix
pp
the
chaldaeans
and
assyrians
called
the
gulf
into
which
the
two
rivers
debouched
nar
marratum
or
river
a
name
which
they
extended
to
the
chaldaean
sea
to
the
whole
persian
gulf
loftus
estimated
about
the
middle
of
the
last
century
the
progress
of
alluvial
deposit
at
about
one
english
mile
in
every
seventy
years
rawlinson
considers
that
the
progress
must
have
been
more
considerable
in
ancient
times
and
estimates
it
at
an
english
mile
in
thirty
years
kiepert
thinks
taking
the
above
estimate
as
a
basis
that
in
the
sixth
century
before
our
era
the
came
from
about
ten
to
twelve
german
miles
to
english
higher
up
than
the
present
rawlinson
estimates
on
his
part
that
between
the
thirtieth
and
twentieth
centuries
a
period
in
which
he
places
the
establishment
of
the
first
chaldaean
empire
the

more
than
miles
above
the
mouth
of

the
north
of
the
present
village
of
kornah
fr
lenormant
has
energetically
defended
this
hypothesis
in
the
majority
of
his
works
it
is
set
forth
at
some
length
in
his
work
on
langue
primitive
de
la
hommel
on
the
other
hand
maintains
and
strives
to
demonstrate
scientifically
the
relationship
of
the
tongue
with
turkish
the
traveller
olivier
noticed
this
and
writes
as
follows
land
there
is
rather
less
fertile
than
in
egypt
because
it
does
not
receive
the
alluvial
deposits
of
the
rivers
with
the
same
regularity
as
that
of
the
delta
it
is
necessary
to
irrigate
it
in
order
to
render
it
productive
and
to
protect
it
sedulously
from
the
inundations
which
are
too
destructive
in
their
action
and
too

to
colonize
this
country
of

at

we
can
find
traces
seem
to
have
belonged
to
three
different
types
the
most
important
were
the
semites
who
spoke
a
dialect
akin
to
aramaic
hebrew
and
phoenician
it
was
for
a
long
time
supposed
that
they
came
down
from
the
north
and
traces
of
their
occupation
have
been
pointed
out
in
armenia
in
the
vicinity
of
ararat
or
halfway
down
the
course
of
the
tigris
at
the
foot
of
the
gordysean
mountains
it
has
recently
been
suggested
that
we
ought
rather
to
seek
for
their
place
of
origin
in
southern
arabia
and
this
view
is
gaining
ground
among
the
learned
side
by
side
with
these
semites
the
monuments
give
evidence
of
a
race
of
character
which
some
have
sought
without
much
success
to
connect
with
the
tribes
of
the
urall
or
altai
these
people
are
for
the
present
provisionally
called
sumerians
they
came
it
would
appear
from
some
northern
country
they
brought
with
them
from
their
original
home
a
curious
system
of
writing
which
modified
transformed
and
adopted
by
ten
different
nations
has
preserved
for
us
all
that
we
know
in
regard
to
the
majority
of
the
empires
which
rose
and
fell
in
western
asia
before
the
persian
conquest
semite
or
sumerian
it
is
still
doubtful
which
preceded
the
other
at
the
mouths
of
the
euphrates
the
sumerians
who
were
for
a
time
in
the
centuries
before
the
dawn
of
history
had
already
mingled
closely
with
the
semites
when
we
first
hear
of
them
their
language
gave
way
to
the
semitic
and
tended
gradually
to
become
a
language
of
ceremony
and
ritual
which
was
at
last
learnt
less
for
everyday
use
than
for
the
drawing
up
of
certain
royal
inscriptions
or
for
the
interpretation
of
very
ancient
texts
of
a
legal
or
sacred
character
their
religion
became
assimilated
to
the
religion
and
their
gods
identified
with
the
gods
of
the
semites
the
process
of
fusion
commenced
at
such
an
early
date
that
nothing
has
really
come
down
to
us
from
the
time
when
the
two
races
were
strangers
to
each
other
we
are
therefore
unable
to
say
with
certainty
how
much
each
borrowed
from
the
other
what
each
gave
or
relinquished
of
its
individual
instincts
and
customs
we
must
take
and
judge
them
as
they
come
before
us
as
forming
one
single
nation
imbued
with
the
same
ideas
influenced
in
all
their
acts
by
the
same
civilization
and
possessed
of
such
strongly
marked
characteristics
that
only
in
the
last
days
of
their
existence
do
we
find
any
appreciable
change
in
the
course
of
the
ages
they
had
to
submit
to
the
invasions
and
domination
of
some
dozen
different
races
of
whom
some
assyrians
and
chaldaeans
were
descended
from
a
semitic
stock
while
the
others
elamites
cossaaans
persians
macedonians
and
parthians
either
were
not
connected
with
them
by
any
tie
of
blood
or
traced
their
origin
in
some
distant
manner
to
the
sumerian
branch
they
got
quickly
rid
of
a
portion
of
these
superfluous
elements
and
absorbed
or
assimilated
the
rest
like
the
egyptians
they
seem
to
have
been
one
of
those
races
which
once
established
were
incapable
of
ever
undergoing
modification
and
remained
unchanged
from
one
end
of
their
existence
to
the
other
the
name
proposed
by
rawlinson
and
by
hincks
and
adopted
by
sayce
seems
to
have
given
way
to
the
title
put
forward
by
oppert
the
existence
of
the
sumerian
or
has
been
contested
by
halevy
in
a
number
of
noteworthy
works
halevy
wishes
to
recognize
in
the
sumerian
documents
the
semitic
tongue
of
the
ordinary
inscriptions
but
written
in
a
priestly
syllabic
character
subject
to
certain
rules
this
would
be
practically
a
or
rather
an
halevy
won
over
guyard
and
pognon
in
france
delitzsch
and
a
part
of
the
delitzsch
school
in
germany
to
his
view
of
the
facts
the
controversy
which
has
been
carried
on
on
both
sides
with
a
somewhat
unnecessary
vehemence
still
rages
it
has
been
simplified
quite
recently
by
return
to
the
sumerian
theory
without
reviewing
the
arguments
in
detail
and
while
doing
full
justice
to
the
profound
learning
displayed
by
halevy
i
feel
forced
to
declare
with
tiele
that
his
criticisms
scholars
to
carefully
reconsider
all
that
has
been
taken
as
proved
in
these
matters
but
that
they
do
not
warrant
us
in
rejecting
as
untenable
the
hypothesis
still
a
very
probable
one
according
to
which
the
difference
in
the
graphic
systems
corresponds
to
a
real
difference
in
their
country
must
have
presented
at
the
beginning
very
much
the
same
aspect
of
disorder
and
neglect
which
it
offers
to
modern
eyes

no

those
of
the

native
traditions
collected
by

this
and
the
testimony
of

usually
cited
as
falling

of

indeed
to
have

above

this

that
it

that

me
in

place

the

did
not

resign
themselves
to
a
confession

on
the

as
they
had
depicted
the
primordial
chaos
the
birth
of
the
gods
and
their
struggles
over
the
creation
so
they
related
unhesitatingly
everything
which
had
happened
since
the
creation
of
mankind
and
they
laid
claim
to
being
able
to
calculate
the
number
of
centuries
which
lay
between
their

day
and
the
origin
of

the
tradition
to

most
credence
was
attached
in
the
greek
period
at
babylon
that
which
has
been
preserved
for
us
in

histories
of

asserts
that
there
was
a
somewhat
long
interval
between
the
manifestation
of

and
the
foundation
of
a
dynasty
the
first
king
was
aloros
of

a
chaldaean

nothing
is
related

that
he
was
chosen
by

himself

the

variations
by

the

we
can
understand
the
vessel
of
shamashnapishtim
was
a
kind
of
immense
kelek
decked
but
without
masts
or
rigging
of
any
sort
the
text
identifies
the
festival
celebrated
by
the
hero
before
the
embarkation
with
the
festival
akitu
of
merodach
at
babylon
during
which
the
powerful
son
sailed
from
borsippa
to
babylon
in
the
bark
of
the
river
asmu
of
the
embarkation
of
nebo
and
his
voyage
on
the
stream
had
probably
inspired
the
information

which
the
embarkation

was
made
the
occasion
of
a
festival
akitu
celebrated
at

berossus
it
was

chaldaean
origin
and
comprised
kings
who
bore
rule
during

the
first
two
evechous
and
khomasbelos
reigned
and
years
while
the
later
reigns
did
not
exceed
the
ordinary
limits
of
human
life
an
attempt
was
afterwards
made
to
harmonize
them
with
probability
the
number
of
kings
was
reduced
to
six
and
their
combined
reigns
to
years
this
attempt
arose
from
a
misapprehension
of
their
true
character
names
and
deeds
everything
connected
with
them
belongs
to
myth
and
fiction
only
and
is
irreducible
to
history
proper
they
supplied
to
priests
and
poets
material
for
scores
of
different
stories
of
which
several
have
come
down
to
us
in
fragments
some
are
short
and
serve
as
preambles
to
prayers
or
magical
formulas
others
are
of
some
length
and
may
pass
for
real
epics
the
gods
intervene
in
them
and
along
with
kings
play
an
important
part
it
is
nera
for
instance
the
lord
of
the
plague
who
declares
war
against
mankind
in
order
to
punish
them
for
having
despised
the
authority
of

nimrod

known
to
us
from

the
majority
of
living
assyriologists
prefer
to
follow
example
and
identify
him
with
the
hero
gilgames
the
name
of
this
hero
is
composed
of
three
signs
which
smith
provisionally
rendered
isdubar
a
reading
which
modified
into
gishdhubar
gistubar
is
still
retained
by

assyriologists

have
been

one
after

have
compared
this
name
with
that
of

a
babylonian
hero
of
whom
aelian
has
preserved
the
memory
jeremias
continued
to
reject
both
the
reading
and
the
identification
several
copies
of
a
poem
in
which
an
unknown
scribe
had
celebrated
his
exploits
existed
about
the
middle
of
the
viith
century
before
our
era
in
the
royal
library
at
nineveh
they
had
been
transcribed
by
order
of
from
a
more
ancient
copy
and
the
fragments
of
them
which
have
come
down
to
us
in
spite
of
their
lacunae
enable
us
to
restore
the
original
text
if
not
in
its
entirety
at
least
in
regard
to
the
succession
of
events
they
were
divided
into
twelve
episodes
corresponding
with
the
twelve
divisions
of
the
year
and
the
ancient
babylonian
author
was
guided
in
his
choice
of
these
divisions
by
something
more
than
mere
chance
gilgames
at
first
an
ordinary
mortal
under
the
patronage
of
the
gods
had
himself
become
a
god
and
son
of
the
goddess
aruru
had
seen
the
abyss
he
had
learned
everything
that
is
kept
secret
and
hidden
he
had
even
made
known
to
men
what
had
taken
place
before
the
the
sun
who
had
protected
him
in
his
human
condition
had
placed
him
beside
himself
on
the
and
delegated
to
him
authority
to
pronounce
decisions
from
which
there
was
no
appeal
he
was
as
it
were
a
sun
on
a
small
scale
before
whom
the
kings
princes
and
great
ones
of
the
earth
humbly
bowed
their
heads
the
scribes
had
therefore
some
authority
for
treating
the
events
of
his
life
after
the
model
of
the
year
and
for
expressing
them
in
twelve
chants
which
answered
to
the
annual
course
of
the
sun
through
the
twelve
months
the
identity
of
gilgames
with
the
accadian
or
rather
with
the
sun
was
recognized
from
the
first
by
rawlinson
and
has
been
accepted
since
by
almost
all
assyriologists
a
tablet
brought
back
by
smith

to

the
whole

is
essentially
an
account
of
his
struggles
with
ishtar
and
the
first
pages
reveal
him
as
already
at
issue
with
the

his
portrait
such
as
the
monuments
have
preserved
it
for
us
is
singularly
unlike
the
ordinary
type
one
would
be
inclined
to
regard
it
as
representing
an
individual
of
a
different
race
a
survival
of
some
very
ancient
nation
which
had
held
rule
on
the
plains
of
the
euphrates
before
the
arrival
of
the
sumerian
or
tribes
smith
the
chaldaean
account
of

remarked
the
difference
between
the
representations
of
gilgames
and
the
typical
babylonian
he
concluded
from
this
that
the
hero
was
of
ethiopian
origin
hommel
declares
that
his
features
have
neither
a
sumerian
nor
semitic
aspect
and
that
they
raise
an
insoluble
question
in
ethnology
his
figure
is
tall
broad
muscular
to
an
astonishing
degree
and
expresses
at
once
vigour
and
activity
his
head
is

the
horns
of

the

bull
he
possessed
not
only
the
strength
of
a
brute
but
his
intelligence
also
embraced
all
things
the
past
and
the
future
he
would
probably
have
triumphed
over
gilgames
if
shamash
had
not
succeeded
in
attaching
them
to
one
another
by
an
indissoluble
tie
of
friendship
the
difficulty
was
to
draw
these
two
future
friends
together
and
to
bring
them
face
to
face
without
their
coming
to
blows
the
god
sent
his
courier
saidu
the
hunter
to
study
the
habits
of
the
monster
and
to
find
out
the
necessary
means
to
persuade
him
to
come
down
peaceably

him
at

entrance

he

enclosure
he
became
sad
he
groaned
he
cried
with
a
loud
voice
his
heart
was
heavy
his
features
were
distorted
sobs
burst
from
his
breast
the
hunter
saw
from
a
distance
that
his
face
was
inflamed
with
anger
and
judging
it
more
prudent
not
to
persevere
farther
in
his
enterprise
returned
to
impart
to
the
god
what
he
had
observed
smith
was
the
first
i
believe
to
compare
his
form
to
that
of
a
satyr
or
faun
this
comparison
is
rendered
more
probable
by
the
fact
that
the
modern
inhabitants
of
chaldaea
believe
in
the
existence
of
similar
monsters
jeremias
places
eabani
alongside
priapus
who
is
generally
a
god
of
the
fields
and
a
clever
soothsayer
following
out
these
ideas
we
might
compare
our
eabani
with
the
proteus
who
pastures
the
flocks
of
the
sea
and
whom
it
was
necessary
to
pursue
and
seize
by
force
or
cunning
words
to
compel
him
to
give
oracular

the

the

the
priestesses

were
young

devoted
to
the
service
of
the

her

besides

an
as
far
as
can
be
guessed
from

narrative
interrupted
as
it
is
by
so
many
lacunae
the
power
of
eabani
over
the
beasts
of
the
field
seems
to
have
depended
on
his
continence
from
the
moment
in
which
he
yields
to
his
passions
the
beasts
fly
from
him
as
they
would
do
from
an
ordinary
mortal
there
is
then
no
other
resource
for
him
but
to
leave
the
solitudes
to
live
among
men
in
towns
this
explains
the
means
devised
by
shamash
against
him

the
story

who
dwells
in
the

and
who
browses
upon
the
grass
like
the
gazelles
who
drinks
with
the
animals
who
sports
with
the
beasts
of
the

the
priestess
saw
the
she
was
afraid
and
blushed
but
the
hunter
recalled
her
to
her
duty
is
he

undo
thy
garment
show
him
thy
form
that
he
may
be
taken

be

he
perceives
thee
he
is
rushing
towards
thee
arrange
thy

he
is
coming
upon
thee
receive
him
with

art
of

his
beasts
which
troop
around
him
will
be

and

will
press
thee
to
his
the

did
as
she
was
commanded
she
received
him
with
every
art
of
woman
and
he
pressed
her
to
his
breast
six
days
and
seven
nights
eabani
remained
near
the
priestess
his
when
he
got
tired
of
pleasure
he
turned
his
face
towards
his
cattle
and
he
saw
that
the
gazelles
had
turned
aside
and
that
the
beasts
of
the
field
had
fled
far
from
him
eabani
was
alarmed
he
fell
into
a
swoon
his
knees
became
stiff
because
his
cattle
had
fled
from
him
while
he
lay
as
if
dead
he
heard
the
voice
of
the
priestess
he
recovered
his
senses
he
came
to
himself
full
of
love
he
seated
himself
at
the
feet
of
the
priestess
he
looked
into
her
face
and
while
the
priestess
spoke
his
ears
listened
for
it
was
to
him
the
priestess
spoke
to
him

whose

thus
spoke
to
him
he
hung
upon
her
words

the
wise
of

said
to

to
the

who
like

over

by
his
strength
i
will
fight
with
him

manifest
to
him
my
power
i
will
send
forth
a

against

must
struggle
with

conducted
her
prisoner
to

the
city
at
that
moment
was
celebrating

festival

did
not
care
to
interrupt
the
solemnities
in
order
to
face
the
tasks
to
which
eabani
had
invited
him
what
was
the
use
of
such
trials
since
the
gods
themselves
had
deigned
to
point
out
to
him

a
dream
the
line
of
conduct
he
was
to
pursue
and
had
taken
up
the
cause

their
children

began
the

sketched
an
alluring
picture
of
the
life
which
awaited
him
if
he
would
agree
not
to
return
to
his
mountain
home
not
only
would
the
priestess
belong
to
him
for
ever
having
none
other
than
him
for
husband
but
gilgames
would
shower
upon
him
riches

honours
will
give
thee

of
uruk
shall
grovel
on
the
ground
before
it
was
by
such
flatteries
and
promises
for
the
future
that
gilgames
gained
the
affection
of
his
servant
eabani
whom
he
loved
for
ever
i
have
softened
down
a
good
deal
the
account
of
the
seduction
which
is
described
with
a
sincerity
and
precision
truly
primitive
shamash
had
reasons
for
being
urgent
khumbaba
king
of
elam
had
invaded
the
country
of
the
euphrates
destroyed
the
temples
and
substituted
for
the
national
worship
the
cult
of
foreign
deities
the
two
heroes
in
concert
could
alone
check
his
advance
and
kill
him
they
collected
their
troops
set
out
on
the
march
having
learned
from
a
female
magician
that
the
enemy
had
concealed
himself
in
a
sacred
grove
they
entered
it
in
disguise
stopped
in
rapture
for
a
moment
before
the
cedar
trees
they
contemplated
the
height
of
them
they
contemplated
the
thickness
of
them
the
place
where
khumbaba
was
accustomed
to
walk
up
and
down
with
rapid
strides
alleys
were
made
in
it
paths
kept
up
with
great
care
they
saw
at
length
the
hill
of
cedars
the
abode
of
the
gods
the
sanctuary
of
irnini
and
before
the
hill
a
magnificent
cedar
and
pleasant
grateful
they
surprised
khumbaba
at
the
moment
when
he
was
about
to
take
his
outdoor
exercise
cut
off
his
head
and
came
back
in
triumph
to
uruk
brightened
his
weapons
he
polished
his
weapons
he
put
aside
his

put
on
his
white
garments
he
adorned
himself
with
the
royal
insignia
and
bound
on
the
diadem

his
tiara
on
his
head
and
bound
on
his
khumbaba
contains
the
name
of
the
elamite
god
khumba
whichenters
into
the
composition
of
names
of
towns
like
khumbi
or
into
those
of
princes
as
khumbanigash
khumbasundasa
khumbasidh
the
comparison
between
khumbaba
and
combabos
the
hero
of
a
singular
legend
current
in
the
second
century
of
our
era
does
not
seem
to
be
admissible
at
least
for
the
present
the
names
agree
well
in
sound
but
as
oppert
has
rightly
said
no
event
in
the
history
of
combabos
finds
a
counterpart
in
anything
we
know
of
that
of
khumbaba
up
to
the
present
smith
places
at
this
juncture
accession
to
the
throne
this
is
not
confirmed
by
the
fragments
of
the
text
known
up
to
the
present
and
it
is
not
even
certain
that
the
poem
relates
anywhere
the
exaltation
and
coronation
of
the
hero
it
would
appear
even
that
gilgames
is
recognized
from
the
beginning
as
king
of
uruk
the
protected
ishtar
saw
him
thus
adorned
and
the
same
passion
consumed
her
which
inflames
mortals
the
love
of
gilgames
she
raised
her
eyes
the
mighty
ishtar
and
she
said
gilgames
be
my
husband
thou
thy
love
give
it
to
me
as
a
gift
to
me
and
thou
shalt
be
my
spouse
and
i
shall
be
thy
wife
i
will
place
thee
in
a
chariot
of
lapis
and
gold
with
golden
wheels
and
mountings
of
onyx
thou
shalt
be
drawn
in
it
by
great
lions
and
thou
shalt
enter
our
house
with
the
odorous
incense
of
when
thou
shalt
have
entered
our
house
all
the
country
by
the
sea
shall
embrace
thy
feet
kings
shall
bow
down
before
thee
the
nobles
and
the
great
ones
the
gifts
of
the
mountains
and
of
the
plain
they
will
bring
to
thee
as
tribute
thy
oxen
shall
prosper
thy
sheep
shall
be
doubly
fruitful
thy
mules
shall
spontaneously
come
under
the
yoke
thy
shall
be
strong
and
shall
galop
thy
bull
under
the
yoke
shall
have
no
gilgames
repels
this
unexpected
declaration
with
a
mixed
feeling
of
contempt
and
apprehension
he
abuses
the
goddess
and
insolently
questions
her
as
to
what
has
become
of
her
mortal
husbands
during
her
long
divine
life
the
spouse
of
thy
youth
thou
hast
condemned
him
to
weep
from
year
to
year
nilala
the
spotted
thou
lovedst
him
afterward
thou
didst
strike
him
and
break
his
wing
he
continues
in
the
wood
and
cries
my
wings
thou
didst
afterwards
love
a
lion
of
mature
strength
and
then
didst
cause
him
to
be
rent
by
blows
seven
at
a
time
thou
lovedst
also
a
stallion
magnificent
in
the
battle
thou
didst
devote
him
to
death
by
the
goad
and
whip
thou
didst
compel
him
to
galop
for
ten
leagues
thou
didst
devote
him
to
exhaustion
and
thirst
thou
didst
devote
to
tears
his
mother
silili
declaration
to
gilgames
and
the
reply
have
been
frequently
translated
and
summarized
since
the
discovery
of
the
poem
smith
thought
to
connect
this
episode
with
the
of
ishtar
to
hades
which
we
shall
meet
with
further
on
in
this
history
but
his
opinion
is
no
longer
accepted
the
of
in
its
present
condition
is
the
beginning
of
a
magical
formula
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
acts
of
gilgames
is
the
only
one
known
to
us
among
this
long
list
of
the
lovers
of
the
goddess
the
others
must
have
been
fairly
celebrated
among
the
chaldaeans
since
the
few
words
devoted
to
each
is
sufficient
to
recall
them
to
the
memory
of
the
reader
but
we
have
not
as
yet
found
anything
bearing
upon
their
adventures
in
the
table
of
the
ancient
classics
which
had
been
copied
out
by
a
ninevite
scribe
for
the
use
of
the
title
of
the
poems
is
wanting
the
text
gives
and
the
legend
evidently
refers
to
a
bird
whose
cry
resembles
the
word
meaning
the
spotted
utters
a
cry
which
may
be
strictly
understood
and
interpreted
in
this
way
this
is
evidently
the
origin
of
our
fable
of
the
thou
didst
also
love
the
shepherd
tabulu
who
lavished
incessantly
upon
thee
the
smoke
of
sacrifices
and
daily
slaughtered
goats
to
thee
thou
didst
strike
him
and
turn
him
into
a
leopard
his
own
servants
went
in
pursuit
of
him
and
his
dogs
followed
his
trail
thou
didst
love
ishullanu
thy
gardener
who
ceaselessly
brought
thee
presents
of
fruit
and
decorated
every
day
thy
table
thou
raisedst
thine
eyes
to
him
thou
seizedst
him
ishullanu
we
shall
eat
melons
then
shalt
thou
stretch
forth
thy
hand
and
remove
that
which
separates
ishullanu
said
to
thee
what
dost
thou
require
from
me
o
my
mother
prepare
no
food
for
me
i
myself
will
not
eat
anything
i
should
eat
would
be
for
me
a
misfortune
and
a
curse
and
my
body
would
be
stricken
by
a
mortal
then
thou
didst
hear
him
and
didst
become
angry
thou
didst
strike
him
thou
didst
transform
him
into
a
dwarf
thou
didst
set
him
up
on
the
middle
of
a
couch
he
could
not
rise
up
he
could
not
get
down
from
where
he
was
thou
lovest
me
now
afterwards
thou
wilt
strike
me
as
thou
didst
the
changing
of
a
lover
by
the
goddess
or
sorceress
who
loves
him
into
a
beast
occurs
pretty
frequently
in
oriental
tales
as
to
the
man
changed
by
ishtar
into
a
brute
which
she
caused
to
be
torn
by
his
own
hounds
we
may
compare
the
classic
story
of
artemis
surprised
at
her
bath
by
actseon
as
to
the
misfortune
of
ishullanu
we
may
compare
the
story
in
the
of
the
fisherman
and
the
genie
shut
up
in
the
leaden
bottle
the
king
of
the
black
islands
was
transformed
into
a
statue
from
the
waist
to
the
feet
by
the
sorceress
whom
he
had
married
and
afterwards
offended
he
remained
lying
on
a
bed
from
which
he
could
not
get
down
and
the
unfaithful
one
came
daily
to
whip
him
ishtar
heard
him
she
fell
into
a
fury
she
ascended
to
heaven
the
mighty
ishtar
presented
herself
before
her
father
anu
before
her
mother
anatu
she
presented
herself
and
said
father
grilgames
has
despised
me
grilgames
has
enumerated
my
unfaithfulnesses
my
unfaithfulnesses
and
my
anu
opened
his
mouth
and
spake
to
the
mighty
ishtar
thou
not
remain
quiet
now
that
gilgames
has
enumerated
to
thee
thy
unfaithfulnesses
thy
unfaithfulnesses
and
ignominies
but
she
refused
to
allow
the
outrage
to
go
unpunished
she
desired
her
father
to
make
a
celestial
urus
who
would
execute
her
vengeance
on
the
hero
and
as
he
hesitated
she
threatened
to
destroy
every
living
thing
in
the
entire
universe
by
suspending
the
impulses
of
desire
and
the
effect
of
love
anu
finally
gives
way
to
her
rage
he
creates
a
frightful
urus
whose
ravages
soon
rendered
uninhabitable
the
neighbourhood
of
uruk
the
the
two
heroes
gilgames
and
eabani
touched
by
the
miseries
and
terror
of
the
people
set
out
on
the
chase
and
hastened
to
rouse
the
beast

its
lair
on

it

him
feel
her
vengeance
in
the
destruction
of
that
beauty
of
which
he
was
so
proud
she
covered
him
with
leprosy
from
head
to

and
made
him
an
object
of
horror
to
his
friends
of
the
previous
day
a
life
of
pain
and
a
frightful
death
he
alone
could
escape

dared
to
go
to
the
confines

the
world
in
quest
of
the
fountain
of
youth
and
the
tree
of
life
which
were
said
to
be
there
hidden

the

was
rough

beset
by
dangers

no
one

who
had
ventured
upon
it
had
ever
returned

resolved
to
brave
every
peril
rather
than
submit
to
his
fate

proposed
this
fresh
adventure
to
his
friend
eabani

notwithstanding
his
sad
forebodings
consented
to
accompany
him
they
killed
a
tiger
on
the
way

eabani
was
mortally
wounded
in
a
struggle
in
which
they
engaged
in
the
neighbourhood
of
nipur
and
breathed
his
last
after
an
agony
of
twelve
duration
wept
bitterly
over
his
friend
eabani
grovelling
on
the
bare
the
selfish
fear
of
death
struggled
in
his
spirit
with
regret
at
having
lost
so
dear
a
companion
a
tried
friend
in
so
many
encounters
do
not
wish
to
die
like
eabani
sorrow
has
entered
my
heart
the
fear
of
death
has
taken
possession
of
me
and
i
am
overcome
but
i
will
go
with
rapid
steps
to
the
strong

learn
from
him
how
to
become

plunges
boldly
into
the
desert

loses
himself
for
a
whole

amid
frightful
solitudes
reached
at
nightfall
a
ravine
in
the
mountain
i
beheld
lions
and
trembled
but
i
raised
my
face
towards

prayed

supplication

even
to
the

he
extended
over
me
his

on

to
him
the
road

was
to
take
with

answers

that

follows
from

the

of
his

remains
unknown
to

thinks
doubtless
that
his

himself
at

in

resignation

that

thou

thou
wouldest
be

to

tell
me
then
how
thou
hast
obtained
this

among

thou

aspired
shamashnapishtim
yields
to
his
wish
if
only
to
show
him
how
abnormal
his
own
case
was
and
indicate
the
merits
which
had
marked
him
out
for
a
destiny
superior
to
that
of
the
common
herd
of

he
describes
the

to
him
and
relates
how
he
was
able
to

from
it
by
the

of

and
how
by

of

he
was
made
while
living
a

now
he
adds

as
thou
art
concerned
which
one
of

will
bestow
upon
thee
the
strength
to
obtain
the

which
thou

upon

shamashnapishtim
the

of

a

upon

this
man
and
he
will
eat
of
the
magic
broth
and
the
road
by
which
he
has
come
he
will
retrace
it
in
health
of

and
the

through
which
he
has
come
forth
he
will
return
by
it
to

spoke
to

misfortunes
of
this

distress
thee
very
well
cook
the
broth
and
place
it
by

and
while
gilgames
still
slept
on

his

the
material
for
the
broth
was
gathered
on
the
second
day
it
was
picked
on
the

it
was
steeped
on

shamashnapishtim
prepared
his
pot
on
the

he
put
into
it
on

the
broth
was
cooked
on

seventh
he
cast
his

suddenly
on

consumed
the
broth
then
gilgames
spoke
to

the
inhabitant
of

hesitated
slumber
laid
hold
of
me
thou
hast
cast
a
spell
upon
me
thou
hast
given
me
the
the
effect
would
not
have
been
lasting
if
other
ceremonies
had
not
followed
in
addition
to
this
spell
from
the
kitchen
gilgames
after
this
preparation
could
now
land
upon
the
shore
of
the
happy
island
and
purify
himself
there
shamashnapishtim
confided
this
business
to
his
mariner
man
whom
thou
hast
brought
his
body
is
covered
with
ulcers
the
leprous
scabs
have
spoiled
the
beauty
of
his
body
take
him
lead
him
to
the
place
of
purification
let
him
wash
his
ulcers
white
as
snow
in
the
water
let
him
get
rid
of
his
scabs
and
let
the
sea
bear
them
away
so
that
at
length
his
body
may
appear
healthy
he
will
then
change
the
fillet
which
binds
his
brows
and
the
which
hides
his
nakedness
until
he
returns
to
his
country
until
he
reaches
the
end
of
his
journey
let
him
by
no
means
put
off
the
however
ragged
then
only
shall
he
have
always
a
clean
then
took
him
and
conducted
him
to
the
place
of
purification
he
washed
his
ulcers
white
as
snow
in
the
water
he
got
rid
of
his
scabs
and
the
sea
carried
them
away
so
that
at

his

appeared
healthy
he
changed
the

which
bound
his
brows
the
loincloth
which
hid
his
nakedness
until
he
should
reach
the
end
of
his
journey
he
was
not
to
put
off
the
however
ragged
then
alone
was
he
to
have
a
clean
the
cure
effected
gilgames
goes
again
on
board
his
bark
and
returns
to
the
place
where
shamashnapishtim
was

him
shamashnapishtim
would
not
send
his

back
to

spoke
to

to

shamashnapishtim
the

is
comforted
he
is
cured
what
wilt
thou
give
to
him
now
that
he
is
about
to
return
to

he
took
the

gilgames
he
brought
the
bark
near
the
shore
and
shamashnapishtim
spoke
to
him
to
gilgames
thou
art
going
from
here
comforted
what
shall
i
give
thee
now
that
thou
art
about
to
return
to
thy
country
i
am
about
to
reveal
to
thee
gilgames
a
secret
and
the
judgment
of
the
gods
i
am
about
to
tell
it
thee
there
is
a
plant
similar
to
the
hawthorn
in
its
flower
and
whose
thorns
prick
like
the
viper
if
thy
hand
can
lay
hold
of
that
plant
without
being
torn
break
from
it
a
branch
and
bear
it
with
thee
it
will
secure
for
thee
an
eternal

the
branch
and
in
his
joy
plans
with
future
enterprises
this
plant
is
the
plant
of
renovation
by
which
a
man
obtains
life
i
will
bear
it
with
me
to
uruk
the
i
will
cultivate
a
bush
from
it
i
will
cut
some
of
it
and
its
name
shall
be

man
becomes
young

it
i
will
eat
of
it
and
i
shall
repossess

the
first
place
on
which
they
set
foot
on
shore
perceived
a
well
of
fresh
water
went
down
to
it
and
whilst
he
was
drawing
water
a
serpent
came
out
of
it
and
snatched
from
him
the
plant
yea
the
serpent
rushed
out
and
bore
away
the
plant
and
while
escaping
uttered
a
malediction
that
day
gilgames
sat
down
he
wept
and
his
tears
streamed
down
his
cheeks
he
said
to
the
mariner
is
the
use
of
my
renewed
strength
what
is
the
use

i

twenty

on

road
and
he
for
himself
alone
has
already
taken

i

the

lost
to

the

of

did
not
proceed
in
its

or
at
one
time
from
the
imagination
of
a
single
individual
each
episode
of
it
answers
to
some
separate
legend
concerning
gilgames
or
the
origin
of
uruk
the
the
greater
part
preserves
under
a
later
form
an
air
of
extreme
antiquity
and
if
the
events
dealt
with
have
not
a
precise
bearing
on
the
life
of
a
king
they
paint
in
a
lively
way
the
vicissitudes
of
the
life
of
the
people
these
lions
leopards
or
gigantic
uruses
with
which
grilgames
and
his
faithful
eabani
carry
on
so
fierce
a
warfare
are
not
as
is
sometimes
said
mythological
animals
cf
vol

of
this
history
for
analogous
ideas
among
the
egyptians
as
to
the
condition
of
the
dead
who
were
neglected
by
their
relatives
the
egyptian
double
had
to
live
on
the
same
refuse
as
the
chaldaean
soul

identifying
gilgames
with
nimrod
believes
on
the
other
hand
that
nimrod
was
a
real
king
who
reigned
in
mesopotamia
about
the
poem

according
to
him
episodes
more
or
less
embellished
in
the
life
of
the
sovereign
similar
monsters
it
was
believed
appeared
from
time
to
time
in
the
marshes
of
chaldaea
and
gave
proof
of
their
existence
to
the
inhabitants
of
neighbouring
villages
by
such
ravages
as
real
lions
and
tigers
commit
in
india
or
the
sahara
it
was
the
duty
of
chiefs
on
the
border
lands
of
the
euphrates
as
on
the
banks
of
the
nile
as
among
all
peoples
still
sunk
in
to
go
forth
to
the
attack
of
these
beasts
and
to
sacrifice
themselves
one
after
the
other
until
one
of
them
more
fortunate
or
stronger
than
the
rest
should
triumph
over
these
mischievous
brutes
the
kings
of
babylon
and
nineveh
in
later
times
converted
into
a
pleasure
that
which
had
been
an
official
duty
of
their
early
predecessors
gilgames
had
not
yet
arrived
at
that
stage
and
the
seriousness
not
to
speak
of
the
fear
with
which
he
entered
on
the
fight
with
such
beasts
is
an
evidence
of
the
early
date
of
the
portions
of
his
history
which
are
concerned
with
his
hunting
exploits
the
scenes
are
represented
on
the
seals
of
princes
who
reigned
prior
to
the
year
and
the
work
of
the
ancient
engraver
harmonizes
so
perfectly
with
the
description
of
the
comparatively
modern
scribe
that
it
seems
like
an
anticipated
illustration
of
the
latter
the
engravings
represent
so
persistently
and
with
so
little
variation
the
images
of
the
monsters
and
those
of
gilgames
and
his
faithful
eabani
that
the
corresponding
episodes
in
the
poem
must
have
already
existed
as
we
know
them
if
not
in
form
at
least
in
their
main
drift
other
portions
of
the
poem
are
more
recent
and
it
would
seem
that
the
expedition
against
khumbaba
contains
allusions
to
the
invasions
from
which
chaldaea
had
suffered
so
much
towards
the
xxth
century
before
our
era
the
traditions
which
we
possess
of
the
times
following
the
deluge
embody
like
the
adventures
of
gilganes
very
ancient
elements
which
the
scribes
or
narrators
wove
together
in
a
more
or
less
skilful
manner
around
the
name
of
some
king
or
divinity
smith
thought
he
could
restore
from
the
poem
a
part
of
chaldaean
history
he
supposed
to
have
been
about
the
liberator
of
babylon
oppressed
by
elam
and
the
date
of
the
foundation
of
a
great
babylonian
empire
to
have
coincided
with
his
victory
over
the
elamites
the
annals
of
assurbanipal
show
us
in
fact
that
an
elamite
king
kudurnankhundi
had
pillaged
uruk
about

had
transported

in
a
piecemeal
condition
in

of

direct

every
city
had
naturally
its
own
version
in
which
its
own
protecting
deities
its
heroes
and
princes
played
the
most
important
parts
that
of
babylon
threw
all
the
rest
into
the
shade
not
that
it
was
superior
to
them
but
because
this
city
had
speedily
become
strong
enough
to
assert
its
political
supremacy
over
the
whole
region
of
the
euphrates
its
scribes
were
accustomed
to
see
their
master
treat
the
lords
of
other
towns
as
subjects
or
vassals
they
fancied
that
this
must
have
always
been
the
case
and
that
from
its
origin
babylon
had
been
recognized
as
the
to
which
its
contemporaries
rendered
homage
they
made
its
individual
annals
the
framework
for
the
history
of
the
entire
country

from
the
succession
of
its
princely
families
on
the
throne
diverse
as
they
were
in
origin
they
constructed
a
complete
canon
of
the
kings
of
chaldaea
but
the
manner
of
grouping
the
names
and
of
dividing
the
dynasties
varied
according
to
the
period
in
which
the
lists
were
drawn
up
and
at
the
present
time
we
are
in
possession
of
at
least
two
systems
which
the
babylonian
historians
attempted
to
construct
berossus
who
communicated
one
of
them
to
the
greeks
about
the
beginning
of
the
iind
century
would
not
admit
more
than
eight
dynasties
in
the
period
of
thousand
years
between
the
deluge
and
the
persian
invasion
the
lists
which
he
had
copied
from
originals
in
the
cuneiform
character
have
suffered
severely
at
the
hands
of
his
abbreviators
who
omitted
the
majority
of
the
names
which
seemed
to
them
very
barbarous
in
form
while
those
who
copied
these
abbreviated
lists
have
made
such
further
havoc
with
them
that
they
are
now
for
the
most
part
unintelligible
modern
criticism
has
frequently
attempted
to
restore
them
with
varying
results
the
reconstruction
here
given
which
passes
for
the
most
probable
is
not
equally
certain
in
all
its
parts
illustration
chronologic
table
it
was
not
without
reason
that
berossus
and
his
authorities
had
put
the
sum
total
of
reigns
at
thousand
years
this
number
falls
in
with
a
certain
astrological
period
during
which
the
gods
had
granted
to
the
chaldaeans
glory
prosperity
and
independence
and
whose
termination
coincided
with
the
capture
of
babylon
by
cyrus
others
before
them
had
employed
the
same
artifice
but
they
reckoned
ten
dynasties
in
the
place
of
the
eight
accepted
by
berossus
after
the
example
of
niebuhr
gutschmid
admitted
here
as
oppert
did
assyrians
he
based
his
view
on
herodotus
in
which
it
is
said
that
the
assyrians
held
sway
in
asia
for
years
until
its
conquest
by
the
medes
upon
the
improbability
of
this
opinion
see

the
existence
of
this
astronomical
or
astrological
scheme

which
berossus
founded

chronology

pointed
out

afterwards
by
gutschmid
it
is
now
generally
accepted
illustration
table
attempts
have
been
made
to
bring
the
two
into
harmony
with
varying
results
in
my
opinion
a
waste
of
time
and
labour
for
even
comparatively
recent
periods
of
their
history
the
chaldaeans
like
the
egyptians
had
to
depend
upon
a
collection
of
certain
abbreviated
incoherent
and
often
contradictory
documents
from
which
they
found
it
difficult
to
make
a
choice
they
could
not
therefore
always
come
to
an
agreement
when
they
wished
to
determine
how
many
dynasties
had
succeeded
each
other
during
these
doubtful
epochs
how
many
kings
were
included
in
each
dynasty
and
what
length
of
reign
was
to
be
assigned
to
each
king
we
do
not
know
the
motives
which
influenced
berossus
in
his
preference
of
one
tradition
over
others
perhaps
he
had
no
choice
in
the
matter
and
that
of
which
he
constituted
himself
the
interpreter
was
the
only
one
which
was
then
known
in
any
case
the
tradition
he
followed
forms
a
system
which
we
can
not
modify
without
misinterpreting
the
intention
of
those
who
drew
it
up
or
who
have
handed
it
down
to
us
we
must
accept
or
reject
it
just
as
it
is
in
its
entirety
and
without
alteration
to
attempt
to
adapt
it
to
the
testimony
of
the
monuments
would
be
equivalent
to
the
creation
of
a
new
system
and
not
to
the
correction
simply
of
the
old
one
the
right
course
is
to
put
it
aside
for
the
moment
and
confine
ourselves
to
the
original
lists
whose
fragments
have
come
down
to
us
they
do
not
furnish
us
it
is
true
with
a
history
of
chaldaea
such
as
it
unfolded
itself
from
age
to
age
but
they
teach
us
what
the
later
chaldaeans
knew
or
thought
they
knew
of
that
history
still
it
is
wise
to
treat
them
with
some
reserve
and
not
to
forget
that
if
they
agree
with
each
other
in
the
main
they
differ
frequently
in
details
thus
the
small
dynasties
which
are
called
the
vith
and
viith
include
the
same
number
of
kings
on
both
the
tablets
which
establish
their
existence
but
the
number
of
years
assigned
to
the
names
of
the
kings
and
the
total
years
of
each
dynasty
vary
a
little
from

the

of
a

the

the
difference
in
the
calculations
the
fault
of
the
scribes
who
in
mechanically
copying
and
recopying
ended
by
fatally
altering
the
figures
or
is
it
to
be
explained
by
some
circumstance
of
which
we
are
ignorant
an
association
on
the
throne

which
the
duration
is
at

neglected
with

of

at

the
later
chaldaeans
did
not
succeed
in
clearing
up
while
awaiting
the
means
to
restore
a
rigorously
exact
chronology
we
must
be
content
with
the
approximate
information
furnished
by
the
tablets
as
to
the
succession
of
the
babylonian
kings
actual
history
occupied
but
a
small
space
in
the
lists
barely
twenty
centuries
out
of
a
whole
of
three
hundred
and
sixty
beyond
the
historic
period
the
imagination
was
given
a
free
rein
and
the
few
facts
which
were
known
disappeared
almost
completely
under
the
accumulation
of
mythical
narratives
and
popular
stories
it
was
not
that
the
documents
were
entirely
wanting
for
the
chaldaeans
took
a
great
interest
in
their
past
history
and
made
a
diligent
search
for
any
memorials
of
it
each
time
they
succeeded
in
disinterring
an
inscription
from
the
ruins
of
a
town
they
were
accustomed
to
copies
of
it
and
to
deposit
them
among
the
archives
where
they
would
be
open
to
the
examination
of
their
archaeologists
when
a
prince
undertook
the
rebuilding
of
a
temple
he
always
made
excavations
under
the
first
courses
of
the
ancient
structure
in
order
to
recover
the
documents
which
preserved
the
memory
of
its
foundation
if
he
discovered
them
he
recorded
on
the
new
cylinders
in
which
he
boasted
of
his
own
work
the
name
of
the
first
builder
and
sometimes
the
number
of
years
which
had
elapsed
since
its
erection
we
have
a
considerable
number
of
examples
of
copies
of
ancient
texts
made
in
this
manner

khammurabi
the
inscription
of
agumkakrimi

came
from

the
last
king
of
babylon
before
the
persian
conquest
has
left
us

found
in
this
manner
the
cylinders
of
shagashaltiburiash
at
sippara
those
of
khammurabi
and
those
of
naramsin
we
act
in
a
similar
way
and
our
excavations
like
those
of
the
chaldaeans
end
in
singularly
disconnected
results
the
materials
which
the
earth
yields
for
the
reconstruction
of
the
first
centuries
consist
almost
entirely
of
mutilated
records
of
local
dynasties
isolated
names
of
sovereigns
dedications
of
temples
to
gods
on
sites
no
longer
identifiable
of
whose
nature
we
know
nothing
and
too
brief
allusions
to
conquests
or
victories
over
vaguely
designated
nations
the
population
was
dense
and
life
active
in
the
plains
of
the
lower
euphrates
the
cities
in
this
region
formed
at
their
origin
so
many
individual
and
for
the
most
part
petty
states
whose
kings
and
patron
gods
claimed
to
be
independent
of
all
the
neighbouring
kings
and
gods
one
city
one
god
one
lord
this
was
the
rule
here
as
in
the
ancient
feudal
districts
from
which
the

of

the
strongest
of
these
principalities

are
acquainted

comprised
a
part
of

possibly
the
distant

these
states
were

to
conceal
their

by
assuming
such
titles
as
of
the
four
houses
of
the
world
of
the
universe
of
shumir
and
northern
babylonia
seems
to
have
possessed
a
supremacy
amongst
them
we
are
probably
wise
in
not
giving
too
much
credit
to
the
fragmentary
tablet
which
assigns
to
it
a
dynasty
of
kings
of
which
we
have
no
confirmatory
information
from
other
sources
amilgula
shamashnazir
amilsin
and
several
others
this
list
however
places
among
these
phantom
rulers
one
individual
at
least
who
has
left
us
material
evidences
of
his
existence
this
sargon
the
elder
whose
complete
name
is
was
the
son
of
a
certain
ittibel
who
does
not
appear
to
have
been
king
at
first
his
possessions
were
confined
to
the
city
of
agade
and
some
undetermined
portions
of
the
environs
of
babylon
but
he
soon
succeeded
in
annexing
babylon
itself
sippara
kishu
uruk
kuta
and
nipur
the
contemporary
records
attest
his
conquest
of
elam
guti
and
even
of
the
land
of
syria
which
was
already
known
to
him
under
the
name
of
amuru
his
activity
as
a
builder
was
in
no
way
behind
his
warlike
zeal
he
built
ekur
the
sanctuary
of
bel
in
nipur
and
the
great
temple
eulbar
in
agade
in
honour
of
anunit
the
goddess
presiding
over
the
morning
star
he
erected
in
babylon
a
palace
which
afterwards
became
a
royal
he
founded
a
new
capital
a
city
which
he
peopled
with
families
brought
from
kishu
and
babylon
for
a
long
time
after
his
day
it
bore
the
name
which
he
bestowed
upon
it
this
sums
up
all
the
positive
knowledge
we
have
about
him
and
the
later
chaldseans
seem
not
to
have
been
much
better
informed
than
ourselves
the
earliest
assyriologists
rawlinson
oppert
considered
the
local
kings
as
having
been
for
the
most
part
kings
of
all
chaldaea
and
placed
them
in
succession
one
after
the
other
in
the
framework
of
the
most
ancient
dynasties

having

of
having

by

up

crisis
in

he
might

utterly
ruined
with
a
more
secure
position
than
ever
all
these
events
are
regarded
as
having
occurred
sometime
about
at
a
period
when
the
vith
dynasty
was
flourishing
in
egypt
some
of
them
have
been
proved
to
be
true
by
recent
discoveries
and
the
rest
are
not
at
all
improbable
in
themselves
though
the
work
in
which
they
are
recorded
is
a
later
astrological
treatise
the
writer
was
anxious
to
prove
by
examples
drawn
from
the
chronicles
the
use
of
portents
of
victory
or
defeat
of
civic
peace
or
rebellion
portents
which
he
deduced
from
the
configuration
of
the
heavens
on
the
various
days
of
the
month
by
going
back
as
far
as
sargon
of
agade
for
his
instances
he
must
have
at
once
increased
the
respect
for
himself
on
account
of
his
knowledge
of
antiquity
and
the
difficulty
which
the
common
herd
must
have
felt
in
verifying
his
assertions
his
zeal
in
collecting
examples
was
probably
stimulated
by
the
fact
that
some
of
the
exploits
which
he
attributes
to
the
ancient
sargon
had
been
recently
accomplished
by
a
king
of
the
same
name
the
brilliant
career
of
sargon
of
agade
would
seem
to
have
been
in
his
estimation
something
like
an
anticipation
of
the
still
more
glorious
life
of
the
sargon
of
nineveh
what
better
proof
of
the
high
veneration
in
which
the
learned
men
of
assyria
held
the
memory
of
the
ancient
chaldaean
conqueror
naramsin
who
succeeded
sargon

his

some

hommel

believes
that
the
life
of

on
the
assyrian
sargon
but
on
a
second
sargon

of
the
facts
in
their
details
and
the
recent
discoveries
have
shown
that
they
were
right
in
so
doing
there
is
a
distant
resemblance
between
the
life
of
the
legendary
sargon
and
the
account
of
the
victories
of
ramses

ending
in
a
conspiracy

the
date
of
naramsin
is
given
us
by

with

and
more
boldly
by

there
is
at

no
serious
reason
to
question
its
accuracy
at
least
relatively
except
the
instinctive
repugnance
of
modern
critics
to
consider
as
legitimate
dates
which
carry
them
back
further
into
the
past
than
they
are
accustomed
to
go
the
astrological
tablets
assert
that
he
attacked
the
city
of
apirak
on
the
borders
of
elam
killed
the
sing
and
led
the
people
away
into
slavery
he
conquered
at
least
part
if
not
the
whole
of
elam
and
one
of
the
few
monuments
which
have
come
down
to
us
was
raised
at
sippara
in
commemoration
of
his
prowess
against
the
mountaineers
of
the
zagros
he
is
represented
on
it
overpowering
their
chief
his
warriors
follow
after
him
and
charge
up
the
hill
carrying
everything
before
their
steady
onslaught
another
of
his
warlike
expeditions
is
said
to
have
had
as
its
field
of
operations
a
district
of
magan
which
in
the
view
of
the
writer
undoubtedly
represented
the
sinaitic
peninsula
and
perhaps
egypt
this
expedition
against
magan
no
doubt
took
place
and
one
of
the
few
monuments
of
naramsin
which
have
reached
us
refers
to
it
other
inscriptions
tell
us
incidentally
that
naramsin
reigned
over
the
houses
of
the
world
babylon
sippara
nipur
and
lagash
like
his
father
he
had
worked
at
the
building
of

and
the
bulbar
of

he
erected
moreover
at
his
own
cost
the

the
latter

through

varied
vicissitudes

the
date
of
its
construction
and
the
name

were

the
text
giving
us
this
information
is
that
in
which
nabonidos
affirms
that
naramsin
son
of
sargon
of
agado
had
founded
the
temple
of
the
sun
at
sippara
years
before
himself
which
would
give

for
the
reign
of

last
independent
king

nabonidos

discovered
the
cylinders
in
which
naramsin
son
of

had
signified
to

all
that
he
had
done
towards
the
erection
of
a
temple
worthy
of
the
deity
to
the
god
of
sippara
three
thousand
two
hundred
years
not
one
of
the
kings
had
been
able
to
find
we
have
no
means
of
judging
what
these
edifices
were
like
for
which
the
chaldaeans
themselves
showed
such
veneration
they
have
entirely
disappeared
or
if
anything
remains
of
them
the
excavations
hitherto
carried
out
have
not
revealed
it
many
small
objects
however
which
have
accidentally
escaped
destruction
give
us
a
fair
idea
of
the
artists
who
lived
in
babylon
at
this
time
and
of
their
skill
in
handling
the
and
chisel
an
alabaster
vase
with
the
name
of
naramsin
and
a
of
exquisitely
veined
marble
dedicated
by
to
the
of
sippara
are
valued
only
on
account
of
the
beauty
of
the
material
and
the
rarity
of
the
inscription
but
a
porphyry
cylinder
which
belonged
to

of

be
ranked
among
the
masterpieces

its
head
to
catch
one

everything
in
this
little

is
equally
worthy
of
admiration
the
purity
of
outline
the
skilful
and
delicate
cutting
of
the
intaglio
the
fidelity
of
the
action
and
the
accuracy
of
form
a
fragment
of
a

the
reign
of
naramsin
shows
that
the
sculptors
were
not
a
bit
behind
the
engravers

gems
this
consists
now
only
of
a
single

attended
with
dangers

much
abraded

its

rather
to
be
guessed
at

the
defaced
aspect

of
some
service
to
it

it
conceals
in
some
respect

rudeness

its

a
precision

chiselling

a
skill

there
are
no
faults
to
be

are
squat

seem
oppressed
by
the
weight
of
the
woollen
covering
with
which
the
chaldeans
enveloped
themselves

viewed
closely

excite
at
once
the
wonder

repulsion
of
an
eye
accustomed
to
the
delicate
grace

at

somewhat
slender
form
which
usually
characterized
the
good

ancient

when
we
have
got
over
the
effect

we
can
but
admire
the
audacity
with
which
the

hard
dolerite

great
resistance

perhaps
than

a
fairly
extended
sovereignty
whose
lords
entitled
themselves
kings
of
shumir
and
akkad
and
ruled
over
all
southern
chaldaea
for
many
centuries
several
of
these
kings
the
lugalkigubnidudu
and
the
lugalkisalsi
of
whom
some
monuments
have
been
preserved
to
us
seem
to
have
extended
their
influence
beyond
these
limits
prior
to
the
time
of
sargon
the
elder
and
we
can
date
the
earliest
of
them
with
tolerable
probability
urbau
reigned
some
time
about
he
was
an
energetic
builder
and
material
traces
of
his
activity
are
to
be
found
everywhere
throughout
the
country
the
temple
of
the
sun
at
larsam
the
temple
of
nina
in
uruk
and
the
temples
of
inlilla
and
ninlilla
in
nipur
were
indebted
to
him
for
their
origin
or
restoration
he
decorated
or
repaired
all
structures
which
were
not
of
his
own
erection
in
uru
itself
the
sanctuary
of
the
owes
its
foundation
to
him
and
the
fortifications
of
the
city
were
his
work
dungi
his
son
was
an
indefatigable
bricklayer
like
his
father
he
completed
the
sanctuary
of
the
and
constructed
buildings
in
uruk
lagash
and
kutha
there
is
no
indication
in
the
inscriptions
of
his
having
been
engaged
in
any
civil
struggle
or
in
war
with
a
foreign
nation
we
should
make
a
serious
mistake
however
if
we
concluded
from
this
silence
that
peace
was
not
disturbed
in
his
time
the
tie
which
bound
together
the
petty
states
of
which
uru
was
composed
was
of
the
slightest
the
sovereign
could
barely
claim
as
his
own
more
than
the
capital
and
the
district
surrounding
it
the
other
cities
recognized
his
authority
paid
him
tribute
did
homage
to
him
in
religious
matters
and
doubtless
rendered
him
military
service
also
but
each
one
of
them
nevertheless
maintained
its
particular
constitution
and
obeyed
its
hereditary
lords
these
lords
it
is
true
lost
their
title
of
king
which
now
belonged
exclusively
to
their
suzerain
and
each
one
had
to
be
content
in
his
district
with
the
simple
designation
of
but
having
once
fulfilled
their
feudal
obligations
they
had
absolute
power
over
their
ancient
domains
and
were
able
to
transmit
to
their
progeny
the
inheritance
they
had
received
from
their
fathers
gudea
probably
and
most
certainly
his
successors
ruled
in
this
way
over
lagash
as
a
fief
depending
on
the
crown
of
uru
after
the
manner
of
the
egyptian
barons
the
vassals
of
the
kings
of
chaldaea
submitted
to
the
control
of
their
suzerain
without
resenting
his
authority
as
long
as
they
felt
the
curbing
influence
of
a
strong
hand
but
on
the
least
sign
of
feebleness
in
their
master
they
reasserted
themselves
and
endeavoured
to
recover
their
independence
a
reign
of
any
length
was
sure
to
be
disturbed
by
rebellions
sometimes
difficult
to
repress
if
we
are
ignorant
of
any
such
it
is
owing
to
the
fact
that
inscriptions
hitherto
discovered
are
found
upon
objects
upon
which
an
account
of
a
battle
would
hardly
find
a
fitting
place
such
as
bricks
from
a
temple
votive
cones
or
cylinders
of
amulets
or
private
seals
we
are
still
in
ignorance
as
to
successors
and
the
number
of
years
during
which
this
first
dynasty
was
able
to
prolong
its
existence
we
can
but
guess
that
its
empire
broke
up
by
disintegration
after
a
period
of
no
long
duration
its
cities
for
the
most
part
became
emancipated
and
their
rulers
proclaimed
themselves
kings
once
more
we
see
that
the
kingdom
of
amnanu
for
instance
was
established
on
the
left
bank
of
the
euphrates
with
uruk
as
its
capital
and
that
three
successive
sovereigns
at
least
of
whom
singashid
seems
to
have
been
the
most
active
were
able
to
hold
their
own
there
uru
had
still
however
sufficient
prestige
and
wealth
to
make
it
the
actual
metropolis
of
the
entire
country
no
one
could
become
the
legitimate
lord
of
shumir
and
accad
before
he
had
been
solemnly
enthroned
in
the
temple
at
uru
for
many
centuries
every
ambitious
kinglet
in
turn
contended
for
its
possession
and
made
it
his
residence
the
first
of
these
about
were
the
lords
of
nishin
libitanunit
gamiladar
inedin
bursin
and
ismidagan
afterwards
about
gungunum
of
nipur
made
himself
master
of
it
the
descendants
of
gungunum
amongst
others
bursin
gimilsin
inesin
reigned
gloriously
for
a
few
years
their
records
show
that
they
conquered
not
only
a
part
of
elam
but
part
of
syria
they
were
dispossessed
in
their
turn
by
a
family
belonging
to
larsam
whose
two
chief
representatives
as
far
as
we
know
were
nurramman
and
his
son
sinidinnam
about
naturally
enough
sinidinnam
was
a
builder
or
repairer
of
temples
but
he
added
to
such
work
the
clearing
of
the
and
the
excavation
of
a
new
canal
giving
a
more
direct
communication
between
the
shatt
and
the
tigris
and
in
thus
controlling
the
of
the
country
became
worthy
of
being
considered
one
of
the
benefactors
of
chaldaea
we
have
here
the
mere
dust
of
history
rather
than
history
itself
here
an
isolated
individual
makes
his
appearance
in
the
record
of
his
name
to
vanish
when
we
attempt
to
lay
hold
of
him
there
the
stem
of
a
dynasty
which
breaks
abruptly
off
pompous
preambles

formulas

there
the
account
of
some
battle
or
the
indication
of
some
foreign
country
with
which
relations
of
friendship
or
commerce
were
maintained
these
are
the
scanty
materials
out
of
which
to
construct
a
connected
narrative
egypt
has
not
much
more
to
offer
us
in
regard
to
many
of
her
pharaohs
but
we
have
in
her
case
at
least
the
ascertained
framework
of
her
dynasties
in
which
each
fact
and
each
new
name
falls
eventually
and
after
some
uncertainty
into
its
proper
place
the
main
outlines
of
the
picture
are
drawn
with
sufficient
exactitude
to
require
no
readjustment
the
groups
are
for
the
most
part
in
their
fitting
positions
the
blank
spaces
or
positions
not
properly
occupied
are
gradually
restricted
and
filled
in
from
day
to

the
expected
moment
is
in

when
the
arrangement
of
the
whole
being
accomplished
it
will
be
necessary
only
to
fill
in
the
details
in
the
case
of
chaldaea
the
framework
itself
is
wanting
and
expedients
must
be
resorted
to
in
order
to
classify
the
elements
entering
into
its
composition
naramsin

in
his
proper
place

nearly
so
but
as
for
gudea
what
interval
separates
him
from
naramsin
and
at
what
distance
from
gudea
are
we
to
place
the
kings
of
uru
the
beginnings
of
chaldaea

merely
a
provisional
history
the
facts
in
it
are
certain
but
the
connection
of

facts
with
one
another
is

a

speculation
the
arrangement

only
as
probable
but
it
would
be
difficult
to
propose
a
better
until

was
a

from

the

eight
inches
to

foot
across

three

inches
thick

a

was
sometimes
spread

handfuls

would
be
strewn

between

to
increase
the
cohesion
more
frequently
the
crude
bricks
were
piled

brought
about

we
moreover

at
various
later
periods
what
is
true
of
one
chaldaean
city
is
equally
true
of
all
of
them
and
the
dynasties
of
uruk
and
of
lagash
like
those
of
uru
can
be
reconstructed
from
the
revelations
of
their
brickwork
the
lords
of
heaven
promised
to
the
lords
of
the
earth
as
a
reward
of
their
piety
both
glory
and
wealth
in
this
life
and
an
eternal
fame
after
death
they
have
indeed
kept
their
word
the
majority
of
the
earliest
chaldaean
heroes
would
be
unknown
to
us
were
it
not
for
the
witness
of
the
ruined
sanctuaries
which
they
built
and
that
which
they
did
in
the
service
of
their
heavenly
patrons
has
alone
preserved
their
names
from
oblivion
their
most
extravagant
devotion
however
cost
them
less
money
and
effort
than
that
of
the
pharaohs
their
contemporaries
while
the
latter
had
to
bring
from
a
distance
even
from
the
remotest
parts
of
the
desert
the
different
kinds
of
stone
which
they
considered
worthy
to
form
part
of
the
decoration
of
the
houses
of
their
gods
the
chaldaean
kings
gathered
up
outside
their
very
doors
the
principal
material
for
their
buildings
should
they
require
any
other
accessories
they
could
obtain
at
the
worst
hard
stone
for
their
statues
and
thresholds
in
magan
and
milukhkha
and
beams
of
cedar
and
cypress
in
the
forests
of
the
amanus
and
the
upper
tigris
under
these
conditions
a
temple
was
soon
erected
and
its
construction
did
not
demand
centuries
of
continuous
labour
like
the
great
limestone
and
granite
sanctuaries
of
egypt
the
same
ruler
who
laid
the
first
brick
almost
always
placed
the
final
one
and
succeeding
generations
had
only
to
keep
the
building
in
ordinary
repair
without
altering
its
original
plan
the
work
of
construction
was
in
almost
every
case
carried
out
all
at
one
time
designed
and
finished
from
the
drawings
of
one
architect
and
bears
traces
but
rarely
of
those
deviations
from
the
earlier
plans
which
sometimes
make
the
comprehension
of
the
theban
temples
so
difficult
a
matter
if
the
state
of
decay
of
certain
parts
or
more
often
inadequate
excavation
frequently
prevent
us
from
appreciating
their
details
we
can
at
least
reinstate
their
general
outline
with
tolerable
accuracy
while
the
egyptian
temple
was
spread
superficially
over
a
large
area
the
chalaean
temple
strove
to
attain
as
high
an
elevation
as
possible
the
whose
angular
profile
is
a
special
characteristic
of
the
landscapes
of
the
euphrates
were
composed
of
several
immense
cubes
piled
up
on
one
another
and
diminishing
in
size
up
to
the
small
shrine
by
which
they
were
crowned
and
wherein
the
god
himself
was
supposed
to
dwell
there
are
two
principal
types
of
these
ziggurats
in
the
first
for
which
the
builders
of
lower
chaldaea
showed
a
marked
preference
the
vertical
axis
common
to
all
the
superimposed
stories
did
not
pass
through
the
centre
of
the
rectangle
which
served
as
the
base
of
the
whole
building
it
was
carried
back
and
placed
near
to
one
of
the
narrow
ends
of
the
base
so
that
the
back
elevation
of
the
temple
rose
abruptly
in
steep
narrow
ledges
above
the
plain
while
the
terraces
of
the
front
broadened
out
into
wide
platforms
the
stories
are
composed
of
solid
blocks
of
crude
brick
up
to
the
present
at
least
no
traces
of
internal
chambers
have
been
found
the
chapel
on
the
summit
could
not
contain
more
than
one
apartment
an
altar
stood
before
the
door
and
access
to
it
was
obtained
by
a
straight
external
staircase
interrupted
at
each
terrace
by
a
more
or
less
spacious
landing
the
second
type
of
temple
frequently
found
in
northern
chaldaea
was
represented
by
a
building
on
a
square
base
with
seven
stories
all
of
equal
height
connected
by
one
or
two
lateral
staircases
having
on
the
summit
the
pavilion
of
the
god
this
is
the
which
excited
the
admiration
of
the
greeks
at
babylon
and
of
which
the
temple
of
bel
was
the
most
remarkable
example
the
ruins
of
it
still
exist
but
it
has
been
so
frequently
and
so
completely
restored
in
the
course
of
ages
that
it
is
impossible
to
say
how
much
now
remains
of
the
original
construction
we
know
of
several
examples
however
of
the
other
type
of
ziggurat
one
at
uru
another
at
bridu
a
third
at
uruk
without
mentioning
those
which
have
not
as
yet
been
methodically
explored
none
of
them
rises
directly
from
the
surface
of
the
ground
but
they
are
all
built
on
a
raised
platform
which
consequently
places
the
foundations
of
the
temple
nearly
on
a
level
with
the
roofs
of
the
surrounding
houses
the
raised
platform

the
temple

nannar

uru

measures
feet
in
height

its
four
angles
are
orientated
exactly
to
the
four
cardinal
points
its
facade
was
approached
by
an
inclined
plane
or
by
a
flight
of
low
steps
and
the
summit
which
was
surrounded
by
a
low
balustrade
was
paved
with
enormous
burnt
bricks
on
this
terrace
processions
at
solemn
festivals
would
have
ample
space
to
perform
their
evolutions
the
lower
story
of
the
temple

a
parallelogram
of
feet
in
length
by
feet
in
width
and
rises
about
feet
in
height
admit
that
between
the
first
and

story
there
was
a
sort
of
plinth
seven
feet
in
height
which
corresponded
to
the
foundation
platform
below
the
first
story
it
appears
to
me
as
it
did
to
loftus
that
the
slope
which
now
separates
the
two
vertical
masses
of
brickwork
accidental
and
owes
its
existence
to
the
destruction
of
the
upper
portion
of

only
two
stories

considers
the

advantage

strength
and
solidity
of
its
appearance

the
chaldean
felt
them
everywhere
about

and
could
not
move
without
incurring
the
danger
of
coming
into
contact
with
them
he
did
not
fear
them
so
much
during
the
day
as
the
presence
of
the
luminary
deities
in
the
heavens
reassured
him
but
the
night
belonged
to
them
and
he
was
open
to
their
attacks
if
he
lingered
in
the
country
at
dusk
they
were
there
under
the
hedges
behind
walls
and
trunks
of
trees
ready
to
rush
out
upon
him
at
every
turn
if
he
ventured
after
sundown
into
the
streets
of
his
village
or
town
he
again
met
with
them
quarrelling
with
dogs
over
the
offal
on
a
rubbish
heap
crouched
in
the
shelter
of
a
doorway
lying
hidden
in
corners
where
the
shadows
were
darkest
even
when
barricaded
within
his
house
under
the
immediate
protection
of
his
domestic
idols
these
genii
still
threatened
him
and
left
him
not
a
repose
the
number
of
them
was
so
great
that
he
was
unable
to
protect
himself
adequately
from
all
of
them
when
he
had
disarmed
the
greater
portion
of
them
there
were
always
several
remaining
against
whom
he
had
forgotten
to
take
necessary
precautions

must
have
been
the
total
of
the
subordinate
genii

towards

are
often
much
puzzled
to
say
what
these
various
divinities
whose
names
we
decipher
on
the

could
possibly
have
represented
the
sovereigns
of

from

the
of

as
no

ever
before
constructed

he
constructed

for

he
wrote
his

made
in

that
was
needful

he
executed

illustration
the
god

patron
of

drawn
by
from
the
attribution
of
this
figure
to
ningirsu
is
very
probable
but
not
wholly
certain
those
we
have
enumerated
were
the
ancient
sumerian
divinities
but
the
characteristics
of
most
of
them
would
have
been
lost
to
us
had
we
not
learned
by
means
of
other
documents
to
what
gods
the
semites
assimilated
them
gods
who
are
better
known
and
who
are
represented
under
a
less
barbarous
aspect
ningirsu
the
lord
of
the
division
of
lagash
which
was
called
girsu
was
identified
with
ninib
inlil
is
bel
ninursag
is
beltis
inzu
is
sin
inanna
is
ishtar
and
so
on
with
the
rest
the
cultus
of
each
too
was
not
a
local
cultus
confined
to
some
obscure
corner
of
the
country
they
all
were
rulers
over
the
whole
of
chaldaea
in
the
north
as
in
the
south
at
uruk
at
urn
at
larsam
at
nipur
even
in
babylon
itself
inlil
was
the
ruler
of
the
earth
and
of
hades
babbar
was
the
sun
inzu
the
moon
the
morning
and
evening
star
and
the
goddess
or
love
at
a
time
when
two
distinct
religious
and
two
rival
groups
of
gods
existed
side
by
side
on
the
banks
of
the
euphrates
the
sumerian
language
is
for
us
at
the
present
day
but
a
collection
of
strange
names
of
whose
meaning
and
pronunciation
we
are
often
ignorant
we
may
well
ask
what
beings
and
beliefs
were
originally
hidden
under
these
barbaric
combinations
of
syllables
which
are
constantly
recurring
in
the
inscriptions
of
the
oldest
dynasties
such
as
pasag
dunshagana
zuaba
and
a
score
of
others
the
priests
of
subsequent
times
claimed
to
define
exactly
the
attributes
of
each
of
them
and
probably
their
statements
are
in
the
main
correct
but
it
is
impossible
for
us
to
gauge
the
motives
which
determined
the
assimilation
of
some
of
these
divinities
the
fashion
in
which
it
was
carried
out
the
mutual
concessions
which
semite
and
sumerian
must
have
made
before
they
could
arrive
at
an
understanding
and
before
the
primitive
characteristics
of
each
deity
were
softened
down
or
entirely
effaced
in
the
process
many
of
these
divine
personages
such
as
ea
merodach
ishtar
are
so
completely
transformed
that
we
may
well
ask
to
which
of
the
two
peoples
they
owed
their
origin
the
semites
finally
gained
the
ascendency
over
their
rivals
and
the
sumerian
gods
from
thenceforward
preserved
an
independent
existence
only
in
connection
with
magic
divination
and
the
science
of
foretelling
events
and
also
in
the
formulas
of
exorcists
and
physicians
to
which
the
harshness
of
their
names
lent
a
greater
weight
elsewhere
it
was
bel
and
sin
shamash
and
eamman
who
were
universally
worshipped
but
a
bel
a
sin
a
shamash
who
still
betrayed
traces
of
their
former
connection
with
the
sumerian
inlil
and
inzu
with
babbar
and
mermer
in
whatever
language
however
they
were
addressed
by
whatever
name
they
were
called
upon
they
did
not
fail
to
hear
and
grant
a
favourable
reply
to
the
appeals
of
the
faithful
whether
sumerian
or
semitic
the
gods
like
those
of
egypt
were
not
abstract
personages
guiding
in
a
metaphysical
fashion
the
forces
of
nature
each
of
them
contained
in
himself
one
of
the
principal
elements
of
which
our
universe
is
composed
earth
water
sky
sun
moon
and
the
stars
which
moved
around
the
terrestrial
mountain
the
succession
of
natural
phenomena
with
them
was
not
the
result
of
unalterable
laws
it
was
due
entirely
to
a
series
of
voluntary
acts
accomplished
by
beings
of
different
grades
of
intelligence
and
power
every
part
of
the
great
whole
is
represented
by
a
god
a
god
who
is
a
man
a
chaldaean
who
although
of
a
finer
and
more
lasting
nature
than
other
chaldaeans
possesses
nevertheless
the
same
instincts
and
is
swayed
by
the
same
passions
he
is
as
a
rule
wanting
in
that
somewhat
lithe
grace
of
form
and
in
that
rather
which
were
the
primary
characteristics
of
the
egyptian
gods
the
chaldaean
divinity
has
the
broad
shoulders
the
figure
and
projecting
muscles
of
the
people
over
whom
he
rules
he
has
their
hasty
and
violent
temperament
their
coarse
sensuality
their
cruel
and
warlike
propensities
their
boldness
in
conceiving
undertakings
and
their
obstinate
tenacity
in
carrying
them
out
their
goddesses
are
modelled
on
the
tyra
of
the
chaldaen
women
or
more
properly
speaking
on
that
of
their
queens
the
majority
of
them
do
not
quit
the
harem
and
have
no
other
ambition
than
to
become
speedily
the
mother
of
a
numerous
offspring
those
who
openly
reject
the
rigid
constraints
of
such
a
life
and
who
seek
to
share
the
rank
of
the
gods
seem
to
lose
all
when
they
put
off
the
veil
like
ishtar
they
exchange
a
life
of
severe
chastity
for
the
lowest
debauchery
and
they
subject
their
followers
to
the
same
irregular
life
which
they
themselves

was

even
command

of

have
as

discovered
no
document
treating
of
the
existence
of
a
supreme
god
or
even
containing
the
faintest
allusion
to
a
divine
unity
we
meet
indeed
with
many
passages
in
which
this
or
that
divinity
boasts
of
his
power
eloquently
depreciating
that
of
his
rivals

ending
his
discourse
with
the
injunction
to
worship
him
alone

the
very
expressions
which
are
used
commanding
future
races
to
abandon
the

of

prove
that
even
those
who
prided
themselves
on
being
worshippers
of
one
god
realized
how
far
they
were
from
believing
in
the
unity
of
god
they
strenuously
asserted
that
the
idol
of
their
choice
was
far
superior
to
many
others
but
it
never
occurred
to
them
to
proclaim
that
he
had
absorbed
them
all
into
himself
and
that
he
remained
alone
in
his
glory
contemplating
the
world
his
creature

side

those
who
expressed
this
belief
in

an
inhabitant
of

say
as
much
and

for
his
worshippers
the
king

is
not
the
sole
god
each
of
the
chief
divinities
received
in
a
similar
manner
the
assurance
of
his
omnipotence
but
for
all
that
his
most
zealous
followers
never
regarded
them
as
the
only
god
beside
whom
there
was
none
other
and
whose
existence
and
rule
precluded
those
of

other
the
simultaneous
elevation
of

enjoyed
at
the

but
a
limited
and
incomplete
personality
confined
to
a
single
concept
and
were
regarded
as
possessing
only
such
attributes
as
were
indispensable
to
the
exercise
of
their
power
within
a
prescribed
sphere
whether
in
heaven
or
on
the
earth
or
in
the
waters
as
each
in
his
turn
gained
the
ascendency
over
his
rivals
he
became
invested
with
the
qualities
which
were
exercised
by
the
others
in
their
own
domain
his
personality
became
enlarged
and
instead
of
remaining
merely
a
god
of
heaven
or
earth
or
of
the
waters
he
became
god
of
all
three
simultaneously
anu

in
the
province
of

of
ea
as
he
ruled
in
his
own

his

that
of

and
ea
ea
treated
anu
and
bel
with
the
same
absence
of
ceremony
which
they
had
shown
to
him
and
added
their
supremacy
to
his
own
the
personality
of
each
god
was
thenceforward
composed
of
many
divers
elements
each
preserved
a
nucleus
of
his
original
being
but
superadded
to
this
were
the
peculiar
characteristics
of
all
the
gods
above
whom
he
had
been
successively
raised
anu
took
to
himself
somewhat
of
the
temperaments
of
bel
and
of
ea
and
the
latter
in
exchange
borrowed
from
him
many
personal
traits
the
same
work
of
levelling
which
altered
the
characteristics
of
the
egyptian
divinities
and
transformed
them
little
by
little
into
local
variants
of
osiris
and
the
sun
went
on
as
vigorously
among
the
chaldaean
gods
those
who
were
incarnations
of
the
earth
the
waters
the
stars
or
the
heavens
became
thenceforth
so
nearly
allied
to
each
other
that
we
are
tempted
to
consider
them
as
being
doubles
of
a
single
god
worshipped
under
different
names
in
different
localities
their
primitive
forms
can
only
be
clearly
distinguished
when
they
are
stripped
of
the
uniform
in
which
they
are
all
clothed
the
and
the
had
been
more
numerous
at
the
outset
than
they
were
subsequently
we
recognize
as
such
anu
the
immovable
firmament
and
the
ancient
bel
the
lord
of
men
and
of
the
soil
on
which
they
live
and
into
whose
bosom
they
return
after
death
but
there
were
others
who
in
historic
times
had
partially
or
entirely
lost
their
primitive
character
such
as
nergal
ninib
dumuzi
or
among
the
goddesses
damkina
esharra
and
even
ishtar
herself
who
at
the
beginning
of
their
existence
had
represented
only
the
earth
or
one
of
its
most
striking
aspects
for
instance
nergal
and
ninib
were
the
patrons
of
agriculture
and
protectors
of
the
soil
dumuzi
was
the
ground
in
spring
whose
garment
withered
at
the
first
approach
of
summer
damkina
was
the
leafy
mould
in
union
with
fertilizing
moisture
esharra
was
the
field
whence
sprang
the
crops
ishtar
was
the
clod
which
again
grew
green
after
the
heat
of
the
dog
days
and
the
winter
frosts
all
these
beings
had
been
forced
to
submit
in
a
greater
or
less
degree
to
the
fate
which
among
most
primitive
races
awaits
those
older
whose
manifestations
are
usually
too
vague
and
shadowy
to
admit
of
their
being
grasped
or
represented
by
any
precise
imagery
without
limiting
and
curtailing
their
spheres
new
deities
had
arisen
of
a
more
definite
and
tangible
kind
and
hence
more
easily
understood
and
having
a
real
or
supposed
province
which
could
be
more
easily
realized
such
as
the
sun
the
moon
and
the
fixed
or
wandering
stars
the
moon
is
the
measure
of
time
it
determines
the
months
leads
the
course
of
the
years
and
the
entire
life
of
mankind
and
of
great
cities
depends
upon
the
regularity
of
its
movements
the
chaldaeans
therefore
made
it
or
rather
the
spirit
which
animated
it
the
father
and
king
of
the
gods
but
its
suzerainty
was
everywhere
a
conventional
rather
than
an
actual
superiority
and
the
sun
which
in
theory
was
its
vassal
attracted
more
worshippers
than
the
pale
and
frigid
luminary
some
adored
the
sun
under
its
ordinary
title
of
shamash
corresponding
to
the
egyptian
ra
others
designated
it
as
merodach
ninib
nergal
dumuzi
not
to
mention
other
less
usual
appellations
nergal
in
the
beginning
had
nothing
in
common
with
ninib
and
merodach
differed
alike
from
shamash
ninib
nergal
and
dumuzi
but
the
same
movement
which
instigated
the
fusion
of
so
many
egyptian
divinities
of
diverse
nature
led
the
gods
of
the
chaldaeans
to
divest
themselves
little
by
little
of
their
individuality
and
to
lose
themselves
in
the
sun
each
one
at
first
became
a
complete
sun
and
united
in
himself
all
the
innate
virtues
of
the
sun
its
brilliancy
and
its
dominion
over
the
world
its
gentle
and
beneficent
heat
its
fertilizing
warmth
its
goodness
and
justice
its
emblematic
character
of
truth
and
peace
besides
the
incontestable
vices
which
darken
certain
phases
of
its
being
the
fierceness
of
its
rays
at
midday
and
in
summer
the
inexorable
strength
of
its
will
its
combative
temperament
its
irresistible
harshness
and
cruelty
by
degrees
they
lost
this
uniform
character
and
distributed
the
various
attributes
among
themselves
if
shamash
continued
to
be
the
sun
in
general
ninib
restricted
himself
after
the
example
of
the
egyptian
harmakhis
to
being
merely
the
rising
and
setting
sun
the
sun
on
the
two
horizons
nergal
became
the
feverish
and
destructive
summer
sun
merodach
was
transformed
into
the
youthful
sun
of
spring
and
early
morning
dumuzi
like
merodach
became
the
sun
before
the
summer
their
moral
qualities
naturally
were
affected
by
the
process
of
restriction
which
had
been
applied
to
their
physical
being
and
the
external
aspect
now
assigned
to
each
in
accordance
with
their
several
functions
differed
considerably
from
that
formerly
attributed
to
the
unique
type
from
which
they
had
sprung
ninib
was
represented
as
valiant
bold
and
combative
he
was
a
soldier
who
dreamed
but
of
battle
and
great
feats
of
arms
nergal
united
a
crafty
fierceness
to
his
bravery
not
content
with
being
lord
of
battles
he
became
the
pestilence
which
breaks
out
unexpectedly
in
a
country
the
death
which
comes
like
a
thief
and
carries
off
his
prey
before
there
is
time
to
take
up
arms
against
him
merodach
united
wisdom
with
courage
and
strength
he
attacked
the
wicked
protected
the
good
and
used
his
power
in
the
cause
of
order
and
justice
a
very
ancient
legend
which
was
subsequently
fully
developed
among
the
canaanites
related
the
story
of
the
unhappy
passion
of
ishtar
for
dumuzi
the
goddess
broke
out
yearly
into
a
fresh
frenzy
but
the
tragic
death
of
the
hero
finally
moderated
the
ardour
of
her
devotion
she
wept
distractedly
for
him
went
to
beg
the
lords
of
the
infernal
regions
for
his
return
and
brought
him
back
triumphantly
to
the
earth
every
year
there
was
a
repetition
of
the
same
passionate
infatuation
suddenly
interrupted
by
the
same
mourning
the
earth
was
united
to
the
young
sun
with
every
recurring
spring
and
under
the
influence
of
his
caresses
became
covered
with
verdure
then
followed
autumn
and
winter
and
the
sun
grown
old
sank
into
the
tomb
from
whence
his
mistress
had
to
call
him
up
in
order
to
plunge
afresh
with
him
by
a
common
impulse
into
the
joys
and
sorrows
of
another
year
the
solar
character
of
nergal
at
least
in
later
times
is
admitted
but
with
restrictions
by
all
assyriologists
the
evident
connection
between
him
and
ninib
of
which
we
have
proofs
was
the
ground
of
theory
that
he
was
likewise
the
burning
and
destructive
sun
and
also
of
analogous
concept
of
a
midday
and
summer
sun
pr
lenormant
seems
to
have
been
the
first
to
distinguish
in
merodach
besides
the
god
of
the
planet
jupiter
a
solar
personage
this
notion
which
has
been
generally
admitted
by
most
assyriologists
has
been
defined
with
greater
exactitude
by
jensen
who
is
inclined
to
see
in
merodach
both
the
morning
sun
and
the
spring
sun
and
this
is
the
opinion
held
at
present
the
differences
between
the
gods
were
all
the
more
accentuated
for
the
reason
that
many
who
had
a
common
origin
were
often
separated
from
one
another
by
relatively
speaking
considerable
distances
having
divided
the
surface
between
them

formed
as
in

complete

locality
as
were
ninib
and
bel
at
nipur
or
ea
and
ishtar
in
uruk
not
that
they
raised
any
opposition
on
principle
to
the
presence
of
a
stranger
divinity
in
their
dominions
but
they
welcomed
them
only
under
the
titles
of
allies
or
subjects
each
moreover
had
fair
play
and
nebo
or
shamash
after
having
filled
the
of
sovereign
at
borsippa
or
at
larsam
did
not
consider
it
derogatory
to
his
dignity
to
accept
a
lower
rank
in
babylon
or
at
uru
hence
all
the
feudal
gods
played
a
double
part
and
had
as
it
were
a
double
civil
portion
that
of
suzerain
in
one
or
two
localities
and
that
of
vassals
everywhere
else
and
this
dual
condition
was
the
surest
guarantee
not
only
of
their
prosperity
but
of
their
existence
sin
would
have
run
great
risk
of
sinking
into
oblivion
if
his
resources
had
been
confined
to
the
subventions
from
his
domain
temples
of
harran
and
uru
their
impoverishment
would
in
such
case
have
brought
about
his
complete
failure
after
having
enjoyed
an
existence
amid
riches
and
splendour
in
the
beginning
of
history
he
would
have
ended
his
life
in
a
condition
of
misery
and
obscurity
but
the
sanctuaries
erected
to
him
in
the
majority
of
the
other
cities
the
honours
which
these
bestowed
upon
him
and
the
offerings
which
they
made
to
him
compensated
him
for
the
poverty
and
neglect
which
he
experienced
in
his
own
domains
and
he
was
thus
able
to
maintain
his
divine
dignity
on
a
suitable
footing
all
the
gods
were
therefore
worshipped
by
the
chaldeans
and
the
only
difference
among
them
in
this
respect
arose
from
the
fact
that
some
exalted
one
special
deity
above
the
others
the
gods
of
the
richest
and
most
ancient
principalities
naturally
enjoyed
the
greatest
popularity
the
greatness
of
uru
had
been
the
source
of
prestige
and
merodach
owed
his
prosperity
to
the
supremacy
which
babylon
had
acquired
over
the
districts
of
the
north
merodach
was
regarded
as
the
son
of
ba
as
the
star
which
had
risen
from
the
abyss
to
illuminate
the
world
and
to
confer
upon
mankind
the
decrees
of
eternal
wisdom
he
was
proclaimed
as
lord
in
comparison
with
whom
all
other
lords
sank
into
insignificance
and
this
title
soon
procured
for
him
a
second
which
was
no
less
widely
recognized
than
the
first
he
was
spoken
of
everywhere
as
the
bel
of
babylon
before
whom
bel
of
nipur
was
gradually
thrown
into
the
shade
the
relations
between
these
feudal
deities
were
not
always
pacific
jealousies
arose
among
them
like
those
which
disturbed
the
cities
over
which
they
ruled
they
conspired
against
each
other
and
on
occasions
broke
out
into
open
warfare
instead
of
forming
a
coalition
against
the
evil
genii
who
threatened
their
rule
and
as
a
consequence
tended
to
bring
everything
into
jeopardy
they
sometimes
made
alliances
with
these
malign
powers
and
mutually
betrayed
each
other
their
history
if
we
could
recover
it
in
its
entirety
would
be
marked
by
as
violent
deeds
as
those
which
distinguished
the
princes
and
kings
who
worshipped
them
attempts
were
made
however
and
that
too
from
an
early
date
to
establish
among
them
a
hierarchy
like
that
which
existed
among
the
great
ones
of
the
earth
the
faithful
who
instead
of
praying
to
each
one
separately
preferred
to
address
them
all
invoked
them
always
in
the
same
order
they
began
with
anu
the
heaven
and
followed
with
bel
ea
sin
shamash
and
bamman
they
divided
these
six
into
two
groups
of
three
one
trio
consisting
of
anu
bel
and
ea
the
other
of
sin
shamash
and
bamman
all
these
deities
were
associated
with
southern
chaldoa
and
the
system
which
grouped
them
must
have
taken
its
rise
in
this
region
probably
at
uruk
whose
patron
anu
v
occupied
the
first
rank
among
them
the
theologians
who
classified
them
in
this
manner
seem
never
to
have
dreamt
of
explaining
like
the
authors
of
the
heliopolitan
ennead
the
successive
steps
in
their
creation
these
triads
were
not
moreover
copies
of
the
human
family
consisting
of
a
father
and
mother
whose
marriage
brings
into
the
world
a
new
being
others
had
already
given
an
account
of
the
origin
of
things
and
of
struggles
with
chaos
these
theologians
accepted
the
universe
as
it
was
already
made
and
contented
themselves
with
summing
up
its
elements
by
enumerating
the
gods
which
actuated
them
they
assigned
the
first
place
to
those
elements
which
make
the
most
forcible
impression
upon
man
beginning
with
anu
for
the
heaven
was
the
god
of
their
city
following
with
bel
of
nipur
the
earth
which
from
all
antiquity
has
been
associated
with
the
heaven
and
concluding
with
ea
of
eridu
the
terrestrial
waters
and
primordial
ocean
whence
anu
and
bel
together
with
all
living
creatures
had
sprung
ea
being
a
god
whom
had
they
not
been
guided
by
local
vanity
they
would
have
made
sovereign
lord
of
all
anu
owed
his
supremacy
to
an
historical
accident
rather
than
a
religious
conception
he
held
his
high
position
not
by
his
own
merits
but
because
the
prevailing
theology
of
an
early
period
had
been
the
work
of
his
priesthood
i
know
of
sayce
only
who
has
endeavoured
to
explain
the
historical
formation
of
the
triads
they
are
considered
by
him
as
of
accadian
origin
and
probably
began
in
an
astronomical
triad
composed
of
the
the
and
the
evening
star
sin
shamash
and
ishtar
alongside
this
elementary
trinity
only
authentic
one
to
be
found
in
the
religious
faith
of
primitive
chaldaea
the
semites
may
have
placed
the
cosmogonical
trinity
of
anu
bel
and
ea
formed
by
the
reunion
of
the
gods
of
uruk
nipur
and
eridu
the
characters
of
the
three
personages
who
formed
the
supreme
triad
can
be
readily
deduced
from
the
nature
of
the
elements
which
they
represent
anu
is
the
heaven
itself
the
immense
vault
which
spreads
itself
above
our
heads
clear
during
the
day
when
glorified
by
the
sun
obscure
and
strewn
with
innumerable
star
clusters
during
the
night
afterwards
it
becomes
the
spirit
which
animates
the
firmament
or
the
god
which
rules
it
he
resides
in
the
north
towards
the
pole
and
the
ordinary
route
chosen
by
him
when
inspecting
his
domain
is
that
marked
out
by
our
ecliptic
he
occupies
the
high
regions
of
the
universe
sheltered
from
winds
and
tempests
in
an
atmosphere
always
serene
and
a
light
always
brilliant
the
terrestrial
gods
and
those
of
take
refuge
in
this
of
anu
when
they
are
threatened
by
any
great
danger
but
they
dare
not
penetrate
its
depths
and
stop
shortly
after
passing
its
boundary
on
the
ledge
which
supports
the
vault
where
they
loll
and
howl
like
dogs
it
is
but
rarely
that
it
may
be
entered
and
then
only
by
the
highly
privileged
kings
whose
destiny
marked
them
out
for
admittance
and
heroes
who
have
fallen
valiantly
on
the
field
of
battle
in
his
remote
position
on
unapproachable
summits
anu
seems
to
participate
in
the
calm
and
immobility
of
his
dwelling
if
he
is
quick
in
forming
an
opinion
and
coming
to
a
conclusion
he
himself
never
puts
into
execution
the
plans
which
he
has
matured
or
the
judgments
which
he
has
pronounced
he
relieves
himself
of
the
trouble
of
acting
by
assigning
the
duty
to
ea
or
eamman
and
he
often
employs
inferior
genii
to
execute
his
will
are
seven
the
messengers
of
anu
their
king
it
is
they
who
from
town
to
town
raise
the
stormy
wind
they
are
the
south
wind
which
drives
mightily
in
the
heavens
they
are
the
destroying
clouds
which
overturn
the
heavens
they
are
the
rapid
tempests
which
bring
darkness
in
the
midst
of
clear
day
they
roam
here
and
there
with
the
wicked
wind
and
the
anu
sends
forth
all
the
gods
as
he
pleases
recalls
them
again
and
then
to
make
them
his
pliant
instruments
enfeebles
their
personality
reducing
it
to
nothing
by
absorbing
it
into
his
own
he
blends
himself
with
them
and
their
designations
seem
to
be
nothing
more
than
doublets
of
his
own
he
is
anu
the
lakhmu
who
appeared
on
the
first
days
of
creation
ahu
urash
or
ninib

the
of
nipur
and
anu
is
also
the
eagle
alala
whom
ishtar
enfeebled
by
her
caresses
anu
regarded
in
this
light
ceases
to
be
the
god
he
becomes
the
only
chief
god
and
the
idea
of
authority
is
so
closely
attached
to
his
name
that
the
latter
alone
is
sufficient
in
common
speech
to
render
the
idea
of
god
bel
would
have
been
entirely
thrown
into
the
shade
by
him
as
the
generally
are
by
the
if
it
had
not
been
that
he
was
confounded
with
his
namesake
of
babylon
to
this
alliance
he
owed
to
the
end
the
safety
of
his
life
in
presence
of
anu
ea
was
the
most
active
and
energetic
member
of
the
triad
as
he
represented
the
bottomless
abyss
the
dark
waters
which
had
filled
the
universe
until
the
day
of
the
creation
there
had
been
attributed
to
him
a
complete
knowledge
of
the
past
present
and
future
whose
germs
had
lain
within
him
as
in
a
womb
the
attribute
of
supreme
wisdom
was
revered
in
ea
the
lord
of
spells
and
charms
to
which
gods
and
men
were
alike
subject
no
strength
could
prevail
against
his
strength
no
voice
against
his
voice
when
once
he
opened
his
mouth
to
give
a
decision
his
will
became
law
and
no
one
might
gainsay
it
if
a
peril
should
arise
against
which
the
other
gods
found
themselves
impotent
they
resorted
to
him
immediately
for
help
which
was
never
refused
he
had
saved
shamashnapishtirn
from
the
deluge
every
day
he
freed
his
votaries
from
sickness
and
the
thousand
demons
which
were
the
causes
of
it
he
was
a
potter
and
had
modelled
men
out
of
the
clay
of
the
plains
from
him
smiths
and
workers
in
gold
obtained
the
art
of
rendering
malleable
and
of
fashioning
the
metals
weavers
and
gardeners
husbandmen
and
sailors
hailed
him
as
their
teacher
and
patron
from
his
incomparable
knowledge
the
scribes
derived
theirs
and
physicians
and
wizards
invoked
spirits
in
his
name
alone
by
the
virtue
of
prayers
which
he
had
condescended
to
teach
them
the
name
of
this
god
was
read
by
oppert
by
hincks
and
lenormant
the
true
reading
is
ia
ea
usually
translated
this
is
a
popular
interpretation
which
appears
to
have
occurred
to
the
chaldaeans
from
the
values
of
the
signs
entering
into
the
name
of
the
god
from
the
outset
rawlinson
recognized
in
ea
which
he
read
hea
hoa
the
divinity
presiding
over
the
abyss
of
waters
he
compared
him
with
the
serpent
of
holy
scripture
in
its
relation
to
the
tree
of
knowledge
and
the
tree
of
life
and
deduced
therefrom
his
character
of
lord
of
wisdom
his
position
as
lord
of
the
primordial
waters
from
which
all
things
proceeded
clearly
denned
by
lenormant
is
now
fully
recognized
his
name
was
transcribed
aos
by
damascius
a
form
which
is
not
easily
explained
the
most
probable
hypothesis
is
that
of
hommel
who
considers
aos
as
a
shortened
form
of
iaos
ia
ea
subordinate
to
these
limitless
and
vague
beings
the
theologians
placed
their
second
triad
made
up
of
gods
of
restricted
power
and
invariable
form
they
recognized
in
the
unswerving
regularity
with
which
the
moon
waxed
and
waned
or
with
which
the
sun
rose
and
set
every
day
a
proof
of
their
subjection
to
the
control
of
a
superior
will
and
they
signalized
this
dependence
by
making
them
sons
of
one
or
other
of
the
three
great
gods
sin
was
the
offspring
of
bel
shamash
of
sin
kamman
of
anu
sin
was
indebted
for
this
primacy
among
the
subordinate
divinities
to
the
preponderating
influence
which
uru
exercised
over
southern
chaldaea
mar
where
ramman
was
the
chief
deity
never
emerged
from
its
obscurity
and
larsam
acquired
supremacy
only
many
centuries
after
its
neighbour
and
did
not
succeed
in
maintaining
it
for
any
length
of
time
the
god
of
the
suzerain
city
necessarily
took
precedence
of
those
of
the
vassal
towns
and
when
once
his
superiority
was
admitted
by
the
people
he
was
able
to
maintain
his
place
in
spite
of
all
political
revolutions
sin
was
called
in

thou

it
would
appear
that
the

had
begun
by
having
in
the
third
place
a
goddess
ishtar
of
dilbat
ishtar

the
evening
star

precedes
the
appearance
of
the

the

star
which
heralds

choice
which
made

an
associate

ea
charged
sin
shamash

with
the

he
distributed
among
them
with
anu
the
command
of
the
army
of
heaven
and
among
these
three
gods
his
children
he
apportioned
the
day

the
night

compelled
them
to
work

ishtar
holding

ishtar

separated
from
her
two
companions
when
the
group
of
the
planets
was
definitely
organized
and
claimed
the
adoration
of
the
devout
the
theologians
then
put
in
her
place
an
individual
of
a
less
original
aspect
ramman
ramman
embraced
within
him
the
elements
of
many
very
ancient
genii
all
of
whom
had
been
set
over
the
atmosphere
and
the
phenomena
which
are
daily
displayed
in
it
wind
rain
and
thunder
these
genii
occupied
an
important
place
in
the
popular
religion
which
had
been
cleverly
formulated
by
the
theologians
of
uruk
and
there
have
come
down
to
us
many
legends
in
which
their
incarnations
play
a
part
they
are
usually
represented
as
enormous
birds
flocking
on
their
swift
wings
from
below
the
horizon
and
breathing
flame
or
torrents
of
water
upon
the
countries
over
which
they
hovered
the
most
terrible
of
them
was
zu
who
presided
over
tempests
he
gathered
the
clouds
together
causing
them
to
burst
in
torrents
of
rain
or
hail
he
let
loose
the
winds
and
lightnings
and
nothing
remained
standing
where
he
had
passed
he
had
a
numerous
family
among
them
of
extraordinary
species
which
would
puzzle
a
modern
naturalist
but
were
matters
of
course
to
the
ancient
priests
his
mother
siris
lady
of
the
rain
and
clouds
was
a
bird
like
himself
but
zu
had
as
son
a
vigorous
bull
which
pasturing
in
the
meadows
scattered
abundance
and
fertility
around
him
the
caprices
of
these
strange
beings
their
malice
and
their
crafty
attacks
often
brought
upon
them
vexatious
misfortunes
shutu
the
south
wind
one
day
beheld
adapa
one
of
the
numerous
offspring
of
ea

in
order
to
provide
food
for
his
family
in
spite
of
his
exalted
origin
adapa
was
no
god
he
did
not
possess
the
gift
of
immortality
and
he
was
not
at
liberty
to
appear
in
the
presence
of
anu
in
heaven
he
enjoyed
nevertheless
certain
privileges
thanks
to
his
familiar
intercourse
with
his
father
ea
and
owing
to
his
birth
he
was
strong
enough
to
repel
the
assaults
of
more
than
one
deity

therefore
shutu
falling
upon

unexpectedly
had
overthrown

his
anger

broke

for
seven
days

breathed
no
longer
upon

at

which
seemed
to

adapa
was
not
quite
at
his
ease
although
he
had
right
on
his
side
but
ea
the
cleverest
of
the
immortals
prescribed
a
line
of
conduct
for
him
he
was
to
put
on
at
once
a
garment
of
mourning
and
to
show
himself
along
with
the
messenger
at
the
gates
of
heaven
having
arrived
there
he
would
not
fail
to
meet
the
two
divinities
who
guarded
them
dumuzi
and
gishzida

in
whose
honour
adapa

it

i

dumuzi

gishzida
will
look
at
each
other
they
will
begin
to
lament
they
will
say
a
friendly
word
to
the

for
thee
they
will
render
clear

observe

dumuzi

are
the
two
gods
whom
adapa
indicates
without
naming
them
insinuating
that
he
has
put
on
mourning
on
their
account
adapa
is
secure
of
gaining
their
sympathy
and
of
obtaining
their
intervention
with
the
god
anu
in
his
favour
as
to
dumuzi
see

of
the
present
work

played
by

as

as

everything
takes

as
ea

the
poor

overthrew

hence
the
anger

that
he
might
not
begin
again
his
acts
of
ill
will
i
broke
his
whilst
he
pleaded
his
cause
the
furious
heart
of
anu
became
calm
the
presence
of
a
mortal
in
the
halls
of
heaven
was
a
kind
of
sacrilege
to
be
severely
punished
unless
the
god
should
determine
its
expiation
by
giving
the
philtre
of
immortality
to
the
intruder
anu
decided
on
the
latter
course
and
addressed
adapa
then
did
ea
allow
an
unclean
mortal
to
see
the
interior

he
handed

thus
lost

remembering

well

commands
of
his

opportunity
which
was
offered
to
him
of
rising
to
the
rank

he
recognized
here
the
encounter
between
sabitum
and

on
the
shores
of
the
ocean
he
was
endowed
with
the
capricious
and
changing
disposition
of
the
element
incarnate
in
him
and
passed
from
tears
to
laughter
from
anger
to
calm
with
a
promptitude
which
made
him
one
of
the
most
disconcerting
deities
the
tempest
was
his
favourite
role
sometimes
he
would
burst
suddenly
on
the
heavens
at
the
head
of
a
troop
of
savage
subordinates
whose
chiefs
were
known
as
matu
the
squall
and
barku
the
lightning
sometimes
these
were
only
the
various
manifestations
of

was

was
usually
employed
to
signify
the
thunderbolt
as
he
destroyed
everything

blind
rage
the
kings

chaldaea
were
accustomed
to
invoke
him
against
their
enemies
and
to
implore
him
to
the
hurricane
upon

the
insubordinate
when

ramman
the
god
of

and

drawn
by
from

properly
speaking
this
is
a
susian
deity
brought
by
the
soldiers
of
assurbanipal
into
assyria
but
it
carries
the
usual
insignia
of
ramman
in
a
word
the
second
triad
formed
a
more
homogeneous
whole
when
ishtar
still
belonged
to
it
and
it
is
entirely
owing
to
the
presence
of
this
goddess
in
it
that
we
are
able
to
understand
its
plan
and
purpose
it
was
essentially
astrological
and
it
was
intended
that
none
should
be
enrolled
in
it
but
the
manifest
leaders
of
the
constellations
ramman
on
the
contrary
had
nothing
to
commend
him
for
a
position
alongside
the
moon
and
sun
he
was
not
a
celestial
body
he
had
no
definitely
shaped
form
but
resembled
an
aggregation
of
gods
rather
than
a
single
deity
by
the
addition
of
ramman
to
the
triad
the
void
occasioned
by
the
removal
of
ishtar
was
filled
up
in
a
blundering
way
we
must
however
admit
that
the
theologians
must
have
found
it
difficult
to
find
any
one
better
fitted
for
the
purpose
when
venus
was
once
set
along
with
the
rest
of
the
planets
there
was
nothing
left
in
the
heavens
which
was
sufficiently
brilliant
to
replace
her
worthily
the
priests
were
compelled
to
take
the
most
powerful
deity
they
knew
after
the
other
five
the
lord
of
the
atmosphere
and
the
thunder
their
embarrassment
is
shown
in
the
way
in
which
they
have
classed
this
god
in
the
original
triad
ishtar
being
the
smallest
of
the
three
heavenly
bodies
naturally
took
the
third
place
ramman
on
the
contrary
had
natural
affinities
with
the
elemental
group
and
belonged
to
anu
bel
ea
rather
than
to
sin
and
shamash
so
we
find
him
sometimes
in
the
third
place
sometimes
in
the
first
of
the
second
triad
and
this
post
of
eminence
is
so
natural
to
him
that
assyriologists
have
preserved
it
from
the
beginning
and
describe
the
triad
as
composed
not
of
sin
shamash
and
ramman
but
of
ramman
sin
and
shamash
or
even
of
sin
ramman
and
shamash
the
gods
of
the
triads
were
married
but
their
goddesses
for
the
most
part
had
neither
the
liberty
nor
the
important
functions
of
the
egyptian
goddesses
they
were
content
in
their
modesty
to
be
eclipsed
behind
the
personages
of
their
husbands
and
to
spend
their
lives
in
the
shade
as
the
women
of
asiatic
countries
still
do
it
would
appear
moreover
that
there
was
no
trouble
taken
about
them
until
it
was
too
late
when
it
was
desired
for
instance
to
explain
the
affiliation
of
the
immortals
anu
and
bel
were
bachelors
to
start
with
when
it
was
determined
to
assign
to
them
female
companions
recourse
was
had
to
the
procedure
adopted
by
the
egyptians
in
a
similar
case
there
was
added
to
their
names
the
distinctive
suffix
of
the
feminine
gender
and
in
this
manner
two
grammatical
goddesses
were
formed
anat
and
belit
whose
dispositions
give
some
indications
of
this
accidental
birth
there
was
always
a
vague
uncertainty
about
the
parts
they
had
to
play
and
their
existence
itself
was
hardly
more
than
a
seeming
one
anat
sometimes
represented
a
feminine
heaven
and
differed
from
anu
only
in
her
sex
at
times
she
was
regarded
as
the
antithesis
of
anu
as
the
earth
in

were
all
goddesses
of
ancient
lineage
and
each
had
been
previously
worshipped
on
her
own
account
when
the
sumerian
people
held
sway
in
chaldaea
as
soon
as
the
semites
gained
the
upper
hand
the
powers
of
these
female
deities
became
enfeebled
and
they
were
distributed

one

doublet
of

who
had
succeeded
in
preserving

liberty
when

to
comparative
insignificance

still
acknowledged
as
queen

mistress

city

the
enervating
influence

they

rightly
interpreted
these
family
arrangements
of
the
gods
had
but
one
reason
for
their
existence
the
necessity
of
explaining
without
coarseness
those
parental
connections
which
the
theological
classification
found
it
needful
to
establish
between
the
deities
constituting
the
two
triads
in
chaldaea
as
in
egypt
there
was
no
inclination
to
represent
the
divine
families
as
propagating
their
species
otherwise
than
by
the
procedure
observed
in
human
families
the
union
of
the
goddesses
with
the
gods
thus
legitimated
their
offspring
the
passive
and
almost
impersonal
character
of
the
majority
of
the
babylonian
and
assyrian
goddesses
is
well
known
the
majority
must
have
been
independent
at
the
outset
in
the
sumerian
period
and
were
married
later
on
under
the
influence
of
semitic
ideas
the
triads
were
therefore
nothing
more
than
theological
fictions
each
of
them
was
really
composed
of
six
members
and
it
was
thus
really
a
council
of
twelve
divinities
which
the
priests
of
uruk
had
instituted
to
attend
to
the
affairs
of
the
universe
with
this
qualification
that
the
feminine
half
of
the
assembly
rarely
asserted
itself
and
contributed
but
an
insignificant
part
to
the
common
work
when
once
the
great
divisions
had
been
arranged
and
the
principal
functionaries
designated
it
was
still
necessary
to
work
out
the
details
and
to
select
v
agents
to
preserve
an
order
among
them
nothing
happens
by
chance
in
this
world
and
the
most
insignificant
events
are
determined
by
previsional
arrangements
and
decisions
arrived
at
a
long
time
previously
the
gods
assembled
every
morning
in
a
hall
situated
near
the
gates
of
the
sun
in
the
east
and
there
deliberated
on
the
events
of
the
day
the
sagacious

submitted
to
them
the
fates
which
are
about
to
be
fulfilled
and
caused
a
record
of
them
to
be
made
in
the
chamber
of
destiny
on
tablets
which
shamash
or
merodach
carried
with
them
to
scatter
everywhere
on
his
way
but
he
who
should
be
lucky
enough
to
snatch

tablets

twelve
of

distinguishable
by

divided
this

many
domains

could
not
go

having

their
consent

person
chastity
and
lasciviousness
kindness
and
ferocity
and
a
peaceful
and
warlike
disposition
but
this
incongruity
in
her
characteristics
did
not
seem
to
disconcert
the
devotion
of
her
worshippers
the
three
other
planets
would
have
had
a
wretched
part
to
play
in
comparison
with
nebo
and
ishtar
if
they
had
not
been
placed
under
new
patronage
the
secondary
solar
gods
merodach
ninib
and
nergal
led
if
we
examine
their
role
carefully
but
an
incomplete
existence
they
were
merely
portions
of
the
sun
while
shamash
represented
the
entire
orb
what
became
of
them
apart
from
the
moment
in
the
day
and
year
in
which
they
were
actively
engaged
in
their
career
where
did
they
spend
their
nights
the
hours
during
which
shamash
had
retired
into
the
firmament
and
lay
hidden
behind
the
mountains
of
the
north
as
in
egypt
the
horuses
identified
at
first
with
the
sun
became
at
length
the
rulers
of
the
planets
so
in
chaldaea
the
three
suns
of
ninib
merodach
and
nergal
became
respectively
assimilated
to
saturn
jupiter
and
mars
and
this
identification
was
all
the
more
easy
in
the
case
of
saturn
as
he
had
been
considered
from
the
beginning
as
a
bull
belonging
to
shamash
henceforward
therefore
there
was
a
group
of
five
powerful
gods
distributed
among
the
stars
of
heaven
and
having
abodes
also
in
the
cities
of
the
earth
whose
function
it
was
to
announce
the
destinies
of
the
universe
some
deceived
by
the
size
and
brilliancy
of
jupiter
gave
the
chief
command
to
merodach
and
this
opinion
naturally
found
a
welcome
reception
at
babylon
of
which
he
was
the
feudal
deity
others
taking
into
account
only
the
preponderating
influence
exercised
by
the
planets
over
the
fortunes
of
men
accorded
the
primacy
to
ninib
placing
merodach
next
followed
respectively
by
ishtar
nergal
and
nebo
the
five
planets
like
the
six
triads
were
not
long
before
they
took
to
themselves
consorts
if
indeed
they
had
not
already
been
married
before
they
were
brought
together
in
a
collective
whole
ninib
chose
for
wife
in
the
first
place
bau
the
daughter
of
anu
the
mistress
of
uru
highly
venerated
from
the
most
remote
times
afterwards
gula
the
queen
of
physicians
whose
wisdom
alleviated
the
ills
of
humanity
and
who
was
one
of
the
goddesses
sometimes
placed
in
the
harem
of
shamash
himself
merodach
associated
with
him
zirbanit
the
fruitful
who
secures
from
generation
to
generation
the
permanence
and
increase
of
living
beings
nergal
distributed
his
favours
sometimes
to
laz
and
sometimes
to
esharra
who
was
like
himself
warlike
and
always
victorious
in
battle
nebo
provided
himself
with
a
mate
in
tashmit
the
great
bride
or
even
in
ishtar
herself
but
ishtar
could
not
be
content
with
a
single
husband
after
she
had
lost
the
spouse
of
her
youth
she
gave
herself
freely
to
the
impulses
of
her
passions
distributing
her
favours
to
men
as
well
as
gods
and
was
sometimes
subject
to
be
repelled
with
contempt
by
the
heroes
upon
whom
she
was
inclined
to
bestow
her
love
the
five
planets
came
thus
to
be
actually
ten
and
advantage
was
taken
of
these
alliances
to
weave
fresh
schemes
of
affiliation
nebo
was
proclaimed
to
be
the
son
of
merodach
and
zirbanit
merodach
the
son
of
ba
and
ninib
the
offspring
of
bel
and
esharra
ishtar
nebo
sin
and
shamash
being
heavenly
bodies
to
begin
with
and
the
other
great
gods
anu
bel
ea
and
ramman
having
their
stars
in
the
heavens
the
chaldaeans
were
led
by
analogy
to
ascribe
to
the
gods
which
represented
the
phases
of
the
sun
merodach
ninib
and
nergal
three
stars
befitting
their
importance
three
planets
there
were
two
councils
one
consisting
of
twelve
members
the
other
of
ten
the
former
was
composed
of
the
most
popular
gods
of
southern
chaldaea
representing
the
essential
elements
of
the
world
while
the
latter
consisted
of
the
great
deities
of
northern
chaldaea
whose
function
it
was
to
regulate
or
make
known
the
destinies
of
men
the
authors
of
this
system
who
belonged
to
southern
chaldaea
naturally
gave
the
position
to
their
patron
gods
and
placed
the
twelve
above
the
ten
it
is
well
known
that
orientals
display
a
great
respect
for
numbers
and
attribute
to
them
an
almost
irresistible
power
we
can
thus
understand
how
it
was
that
the
chaldaeans
applied
them
to
designate
their
divine
masters
and
we
may
calculate
from
these
numbers
the
estimation
in
which
each
of
these
masters
was
held
the
goddesses
had
no
value
assigned
to
them
in
this
celestial
arithmetic
ishtar
excepted
who
was
not
a
mere
duplication
more
or
less
ingenious
of
a
previously
existing
deity
but
possessed
from
the
beginning
an
independent
life
and
could
thus
claim
to
be
called
goddess
in
her
own
right
the
members
of
the
two
triads
were
arranged
on
a
descending
scale
anu
taking
the
highest
place
the
scale
was
considered
to
consist
of
a
soss
of
sixty
units
in
length
and
each
of
the
deities
who
followed
anu
was
placed
ten
of
these
units
below
his
predecessor
bel
at
units
ea
at
sin
at
shamash
at
ramman
at
or
the
gods
of
the
planets
were
not
arranged
in
a
regular
series
like
those
of
the
triads
but
the
numbers
attached
to
them
expressed
their
proportionate
influence
on
terrestrial
affairs
to
ninib
was
assigned
the
same
number
as
had
been
given
to
bel
to
merodach
perhaps
to
ishtar
to
nergal
and
to
nebo
the
various
spirits
were
also
fractionally
estimated
but
this
as
a
class
and
not
as
individuals
the
priests
would
not
have
known
how
to
have
solved
the
problem
if
they
had
been
obliged
to
ascribe
values
to
the
infinity
of
existences
as
the
heliopolitans
were
obliged
to
eliminate
from
the
ennead
many
feudal
divinities
so
the
chaldaeans
had
left
out
of
account
many
of
their
sovereign
deities
especially
goddesses
bau
of
uru
nana
of
uruk
and
allat
or
if
they
did
introduce
them
into
their
calculations
it
was
by
a
subterfuge
by
identifying
them
with
other
goddesses
to
whom
places
had
been
already
assigned
bau
being
thus
coupled
with
ohila
nana
with
ishtar
and
allat
with
if
figures
had
been
assigned
to
the
latter
proportionate
to
the
importance
of
the
parts
they
played
and
the
number
of
their
votaries
how
comes
it
that
they
were
excluded
from
the
cycle
of
the
great
gods
they
were
actually
placed
alongside
rather
than
below
the
two
councils
and
without
insistence
upon
the
rank
which
they
enjoyed
in
the
hierarchy
but
the
confusion
which
soon
arose
among
divinities
of
identical
or
analogous
nature
opened
the
way
for
inserting
all
the
neglected
personalities
in
the
framework
already
prepared
for
them
a
like
dagan
would
mingle
naturally
with
anu
and
enjoy
like
honours
with
him
the
gods
of
all
ranks
associated
with
the
sun
or
fire
nusku
gibil
and
dumuzi
who
had
not
been
at
first
received
among
the
privileged
group
obtained
a
place
there
by
virtue
of
their
assimilation
to
shamash
and
his
secondary
forms
ninib
and
nergal
ishtar
absorbed
all
her
companions
and
her
name
put
in
the
plural
ishtarati
ishtars
embraced
all
goddesses
in
general
just
as
the
name
hani
took
in
all
the
gods
thanks
to
this
compromise
the
system
flourished
and
was
widely
accepted
local
vanity
was
always
able
to
find
a
means
for
placing
in
a
prominent
place
within
it
the
feudal
deity
and
for
reconciling
his
pretensions
to
the
highest
rank
with
the
order
of
precedence
laid
down
by
the
theologians
of
uruk
the
local
god
was
always
the
king
of
the
gods
the
father
of
the
gods
he
who
was
worshipped
above
the
others
in
everyday
life
and
whose
public
cult
constituted
the
religion
of
the
state
or
city
as
far
as
we
can
at
present
determine
the
most
ancient
series
established
was
that
of
the
planetary
gods
whose
values
following
each
other
irregularly
are
not
calculated
on
a
scheme
of
mathematical
progression
but
according
to
the
empirical
importance
which
a
study
of
predictions
had
ascribed
to
each
planet
the
regular
series
that
of
the
great
gods
bears
in
its
regularity
the
stamp
of
its
later
introduction
it
was
instituted
after
the
example
of
the
former
but
with
corrections
of
what
seemed
capricious
and
fixing
the
interval
between
the
gods
always
at
the
same
figure
the
temples
were
miniature
reproductions
of
the
arrangement
of
the
universe
the
represented
in
its
form
the
mountain
of
the
world
and
the
halls
ranged
at
its
feet
resembled
approximately
the
accessory
parts
of
the
world
the
temple
of
merodach
at
babylon
comprised
them
all
up
to
the
chambers
of
fate
where
the
sun
received
every
morning
the
tablets
of
destiny
the
name
often
indicated
the
nature
of
the
patron
deity
or
one
of
his
attributes
the
temple
of
shamash
at
larsam
for
instance
was
called
house
of
the
sun
and
that
of
nebo
at
borsippa
eternal
no
matter
where
the
sanctuary
of
a
specific
god
might
be
placed
it
always
bore
the
same
name
shamash
for
example
dwelt
at
sippara
as
at
larsam
in
an
in
chaldaea
as
in
egypt
the
king
or
chief
of
the
state
was
the
priest
and
the
title
of
so
frequent
in
the
early
period
shows
that
the
chief
was
regarded
as
representing
the
divinity
among
his
own
people
but
a
priestly
body
partly
hereditary
partly
selected
fulfilled
for
him
his
daily
sacerdotal
functions
and
secured
the
regularity
of
the
services
a
chief
priest
was
at
their
head
and
his
principal
duty
was
the
pouring
out
of
the
libation
each
temple
had
its
but
he
who
presided
over
the
worship
of
the
feudal
deity
took
precedence
of
all
the
others
in
the
city
as
in
the
case
of
the
chief
priests
of
at
babylon
of
sin
at
uru
and
of
shamash
at
larsam
or
sippara
he
presided
over
various
categories
of
priests
and
priestesses
whose
titles
and
positions
in
the
hierarchy
are
not
well
known
the
appear
to
have
occupied
after
him
the
most
important
place
as
chamberlains
attached
to
the
house
of
the
god
and
as
his
liegemen
to
some
of
these
was
entrusted
the
management
of
the
harem
of
the
god
while
others
were
overseers
of
the
remaining
departments
of
his
palace
the
and
the
were
especially
charged
with
the
management
of
his
financial
interests
while
the

with
holy
and
perfumed
oil

statues
of

or

the

and
the
objects
used
in
worship
and
sacrifice
such
as
the
great
basins
the
of
copper
which
contained
the
water
employed
in
the
ritual
ablutions
and
the
victims
led
to
the
altar
after
these
came
a
host
of
officials
butchers
and
their
assistants
soothsayers
augurs
prophets
in
fact
all
the
attendants
that
the
complicated
rites
as
numerous
in
chaldaea
as
in
egypt
required
not
to
speak
of
the
bands
of
women
and
men
who
honoured
the
god
in
meretricious
rites
occupation
for
this
motley
crowd
was
never
lacking
every
day
and
almost
every
hour
a
fresh
ceremony
required
the
services
of
one
or
other
member
of
the
staff
from
the
monarch
himself
or
his
deputy
in
the
temple
down
to
the
lowest
sacristan
the
of
the
month
blul
was
set
apart
at
babylon
for
the
worship
of
bel
and
beltis
the
sovereign
made
a
donation
to
them
according
as
he
was
disposed
and
then
celebrated
before
them
the
customary
sacrifices
and
if
he
raised
his
hand
to
plead
for
any
favour
he
obtained
it
without
fail
the
was
dedicated
to
the

devoted
to
the
laudation
of

while
the
was
a
for
the
great
goddess
gula
the
whole
year
was
taken
up
in
a
way
similar
to
this
casual
specimen
from
the
calendar
the
kings
in
founding
a
temple
not
only
bestowed
upon
it
the
objects
and
furniture
required
for
present
exigencies
such
as
lambs
and
oxen
birds
fish

liquors
incense
and
odoriferous
essences
they
assigned
to
it
an
annual
income
from
the
treasury
slaves

lands

their
royal
successors

accustomed
to
renew
these
gifts
or
increase
them
on
every
opportunity
every
victorious
campaign

him
his
share
in
the
spoils
and
captives
every
fortunate
or
unfortunate
event
which
occurred
in
connection
with
the
state
or
royal
family
meant
an
increase
in
the
gifts
to
the
god
as
an
act
of
thanksgiving
on
the
one
hand
for
the
divine
favour
or
as
an
offering
on
the
other
to
appease
the
wrath
of
the
god
gold
silver
copper
gems
and
precious
woods
accumulated
in
the
sacred
treasury
fields
were
added
to
fields
flocks
to
flocks
slaves
to
slaves
and
the
result
of
such
increase
would
in
a
few
generations
have
made
the
possessions
of
the
god
equal
to
those
of
the
reigning
sovereign
if
the
attacks
of
neighbouring
peoples
had
not
from
time
to
time
issued
in
the
loss
of
a
part
of
it
or
if
the
king
himself
had
not
under
financial
pressure
replenished
his
treasury
at
the
expense
of
the
priests
to
prevent
such
usurpations
as
far
as
possible
maledictions
were
hurled
at
every
one
who
should
dare
to
lay
a
sacrilegious
hand
on
the
least
object
belonging
to
the
divine
domain
it
was
predicted
of
such
he
would
be
killed
like
an
ox
in
the
midst
of
his
prosperity
and
slaughtered
like
a
wild
urus
in
the
fulness
of
his
strength
may
his
name
be
effaced
from
his
stelae
in
the
temple
of
his
god
may
his
god
see
pitilessly
the
disaster
of
his
country
may
the
god
ravage
his
land
with
the
waters
of
heaven
ravage
it
with
the
waters
of
the
earth
may
he
be
pursued
as
a
nameless
wretch
and
his
seed
fall
under
servitude
may
this
man
like
every
one
who
acts
adversely
to
his
master
find
nowhere
a
refuge
afar
off
under
the
vault
of
the
skies
or
in
any
abode
of
man
these
threats
terrible
as
they
were
did
not
succeed
in
deterring
the
daring
and
the
mighty

of
the
time

willing

accommodating

as
belnadinabal
the
piety

private
individuals
stimulated
by
fear

be
enough
to
repair
the

soon
make
up

detriment
caused

an
indestructible
fief
whose
administration
was
a
function
of
the
chief
priest
for
life
and
whose
revenue
furnished
means
in
abundance
for
the
personal
exigencies
of
the
gods
as
well
as
the
support
of
his
ministers
this
was
nothing
more
than
justice
would
prescribe
a
loyal
and
universal
faith
would
not
only
acknowledge
the
whole
world
to
be
the
creation
of
the
gods
but
also
their
inalienable
domain
it
belonged
to
them
at
the
beginning
every
one
in
the
state
of
which
the
god
was
the
sovereign
lord
all
those
whether
nobles
or
serfs
vicegerents
or
kings
who
claimed
to
have
any
possession
in
it
were
but
ephemeral
of
portions
of
which
they
fancied
themselves
the
owners
donations
to
the
temples
were
therefore
nothing
more
than
voluntary
restitutions
which
the
gods
consented
to
accept
graciously
deigning
to
be
well
pleased
with
the
givers
when
after
they
might
have
considered
the
gifts
as
merely
displays
of
strict
honesty
which
merited
neither
recognition
nor
thanks
they
allowed
however
the
best
part
of
their
patrimony
to
remain
in
the
hands
of
strangers
and
they
contented
themselves
with
what
the
pretended
generosity
of
the
faithful
might
see
fit
to
assign
to
them
of
their
lands
some
were
directly
cultivated
by
the
priests
themselves
others
were
leased
to
lay
people
of
every
rank
who
took
off
the
shoulders
of
the
priesthood
all
the
burden
of
managing
them
while
rendering
at
the
same
time
the
profit
that
accrued
from
them
others
were
let
at
a
fixed
rent
according
to
contract
the
tribute
of
dates
corn
and
fruit
which
was
rendered
to
the
temples
to
celebrate
certain
commemorative
ceremonies
in
the
honour
of
this
or
that
deity
were
fixed
charges
upon
certain
lands
which
at
length
usually
fell
entirely
into
the
hands
of
the
priesthood
as
mortmain
possessions
these
were
the
sources
of
the
fixed
revenues
of
the
gods
by
means
of
which
they
and
their
people
were
able
to
live
if
not
luxuriously
at
least
in
a
manner
befitting
their
dignity
the
offerings
and
sacrifices
were
a
kind
of
windfall
of
which
the
quantity
varied
strangely
with
the
seasons
at
certain
times
few
were
received
while
at
other
times
there
was
a
superabundance
the
greatest
portion
of
them
was
consumed
on
the
spot
by
the
officials
of
the
sanctuary
the
part
which
could
be
preserved
without
injury
was
added
to
the
produce
of
the
domain
and
constituted
a
kind
of
reserve
for
a
rainy
day
or
was
used
to
produce
more
of
its
kind
the
priests
made
great
profit
out
of
corn
and
metals
and
the
skill
with
which
they
conducted
commercial
operations
in
silver
was
so
notorious
that
no
private
person
hesitated
to
entrust
them
with
the
management
of
his
capital
they
were
the
intermediaries
between
lenders
and
borrowers
and
the
commissions
which
they
obtained
in
these
transactions
was
not
the
smallest
or
the
least
certain
of
their
profits
they
maintained
troops
of
slaves
labourers
gardeners
workmen
and
even
and
sacred
courtesans
of
which
mention
has
been
made
above
all
of
whom
either
worked
directly
for
them
in
their
several
trades
or
were
let
out
to
those
who
needed
their
services
the
god
was
not
only
the
greatest
cultivator
in
the
state
after
the
king
sometimes
even
excelling
him
in
this
respect
but
he
was
also
the
most
active
manufacturer
and
many
of
the
utensils
in
daily
use
as
well
as
articles
of
luxury
proceeded
from
his
workshops
his
possessions
secured
for
him
a
paramount
authority
in
the
city
and
also
an
influence
in
the
councils
of
the
king
the
priests
who
represented
him
on
earth
thus
became
mixed
up
in
state
affairs
and
exercised
authority
on
his
behalf
in
the
same
measure
as
the
officers
of
the
crown

votary
led
to
the
god
to
receive
the
reward
of
the
sacrifice
drawn

he
had
indeed
as
much
need
of
riches
and
renown
as
the
least
of
his
clients
as
he
was
subject
to
all
human
failings
and
experienced
all
the
appetites
of
mankind
he
had
to
be
nourished
clothed
and
amused
and
this
could
be
done
only
at
great
expense
the
stone
or
wooden
statues
erected
to
him
in
the
sanctuaries
furnished
him
with
bodies
which
he
animated
with
his
breath
and
accredited
to
his
clients
as
the
receivers
of
all
things
needful
to
him
in
his
mysterious
kingdom
the
images
of
the
gods
were
clothed
in
vestments
they
were
anointed
with
odoriferous
oils
covered
with
jewels
served
with
food

during
these
operations
the
divinities
themselves
above

down
in
the
abyss
or
in
the
bosom
of
the
earth
were
arrayed
in
garments
their
bodies
were
perfumed
with
unguents
and
their
appetites
fully
satisfied
all
that
was
further
required
for
this
purpose
was
the
offering
of
sacrifices
together
with
prayers
and
prescribed
rites
the
priest
began
by
solemnly
inviting
the
gods
to
the
feast
as
soon
as
they
sniffed
from
afar
the
smell
of
the
good
cheer
that
awaited
them
they
ran

in

most
ancient

appear
that
even
human
sacrifices
were

but
this
custom
was
obsolete
except
on
rare
occasions
and
lambs
oxen
sometimes
flesh
formed
the

the

the
unctuous
smoke
and
fed
on
it
with
delight
when
they
had
finished
their

the
supplication
of
a
favour
was
adroitly
added
to
which
they
gave
a
favourable
hearing

was

in

morning

which
private
individuals
might

as
that
of

year
required
an
abundance
of
extravagant
sacrifices
in
which
the
blood
of
the
victims
flowed
like
water
days
of
sorrow
and
mourning
alternated
with
these
days
of
joy
during
which
the
people
and
the
magnates
gave
themselves
up
to
severe
fasting
and
acts
of
penitence
the
chaldeans
had
a
lively
sense
of
human
frailty
and
of
the
risks
entailed
upon
the
sinner
by
disobedience
to
the
gods
the
dread
of
sinning
haunted
them
during
their
whole
life
they
continually
subjected
the
motives
of
their
actions
to
a
strict
scrutiny
and
once
had
revealed
to
them
the
shadow
of
an
evil
intent
they
were
accustomed
to
implore
pardon
for
it

humble
manner

in
the
eyes
of
the
chaldaean
was
not
as
with
us
an
infirmity
of
the
soul
it
assaulted
the
body
like
an
actual
virus
and
the
fear
of
physical
suffering
or
death
engendered
by
it
inspired
these
complaints
with
a
note
of
sincerity
which
can
not
be
mistaken
every
individual
is
placed
from
the
moment
of
his
birth
under
the
protection
of
a
god
and
goddess
of
whom
he
is
the
servant
or
rather
the
son
and
whom
he
never
addresses
otherwise
than
as
his
god
and
his
goddess
these
deities
accompany
him
night
and
day
not
so
much
to
protect
him
from
visible
dangers
as
to
guard
him
from
the
invisible
beings
which
ceaselessly
hover
round
him
and
attack
him
on
every
side
if
he
is
devout
piously
disposed
towards
his
divine
patrons
and
the
deities
of
his
country
if
he
observes
the
prescribed
rites
recites
the
prayers
performs
the
sacrifices
in
a
word
if
he
acts
rightly
their
aid
is
never
lacking
they
bestow
upon
him
a
numerous
posterity
a
happy
old
age
prolonged
to
the
term
fixed
by
fate
when
he
must
resign
himself
to
close
his
eyes
for
ever
to
the
light
of
day
if
on
the
contrary
he
is
wicked
violent

word
can
not
be

him

who

themselves
of
his

and

it
with

finally
despatching
him
penitence
is
of
avail
against
the
evil
of
sin
and
serves
to
a
right
course
of
life
but
its
efficacy
is
not
permanent
and
the
moment
at
last
arrives
in
which
death
getting
the
upper
hand
carries
its
victim
away
the
chaldaeans
had
not
such
clear
ideas
as
to
what
awaited
them
in
the
other
world
as
the
egyptians
possessed
whilst
the
tomb
the
mummy
the
perpetuity
of
the
funeral
revenues
and
the
safety
of
the
double
were
the
engrossing
subjects
in
egypt
the
chaldaean
texts
are
almost
entirely
silent
as
to
the
condition
of
the
soul
and
the
living
seem
to
have
had
no
further
concern
about
the
dead
than
to
get
rid
of
them
as
quickly
and
as
completely
as
possible
they
did
not
believe
that
everything
was
over
at
the
last
breath
but
they
did
not
on
that
account
think
that
the
fate
of
that
which
survived
was
indissolubly
associated
with
the
perishable
part
and
that
the
disembodied
soul
was
either
annihilated
or
survived
according
as
the
flesh
in
which
it
was
sustained
was
annihilated
or
survived
in
the
tomb
the
soul
was
doubtless
not
utterly
unconcerned
about
the
fate
of
the
it
had
quitted
its
pains
were
intensified
on
being
despoiled
of
its
earthly
case
if
the
latter
were
mutilated
or
left
without
sepulture
a
prey
to
the
fowls
of
the
air
this
feeling
however
was
not
sufficiently
developed
to
create
a
desire
for
escape
from
corruption
entirely
and
to
cause
a
resort
to
the
mummifying
process
of
the
egyptians

not

of
egypt
an
it
was
constructed
of
dried
or
burnt
brick
and
its
form
varied
much
from
the
most
ancient
times
sometimes
it
was
a
great
vaulted
chamber
the
courses
forming
the
roof
being
arranged
and
contained
the
remains
of
one
or
two
bodies
walled
up
within
it
at
other
times
it
consisted
merely
of
an
earthen
jar
in
which
the
corpse
had
been
inserted
in
a
posture
or
was
composed
of
two
enormous
cylindrical
jars
which
when
united
and
cemented
with
bitumen
formed
a
kind
of
barrel
around
the
body
other
tombs
are
represented
by
wretched
structures
sometimes
oval
and
sometimes
round
in
shape
placed
upon
a
brick
base
and
covered
by
a
flat
or
domed
roof
the
interior
was
not
of
large
dimensions
and
to
enter
it
was
necessary
to
stoop
to
a
creeping
posture
the
occupant
of
the
smallest
chambers
was
content
to
have
with
him
his
linen
his
ornaments
some
bronze
arrowheads
and
metal
or
clay
vessels
others
contained
furniture
which
though
not
as
complete
as
that
found
in
egyptian
sepulchres
must
have
ministered
to
all
the
needs
of
the
spirit
the
body
was
stretched
fully
clothed
upon
a
mat
impregnated
with
bitumen
the
head
supported
by
a
cushion
or
flat
brick
the
arms
laid
across
the
breast
and
the
shroud
adjusted
by
bands
to
the
loins
and
legs
sometimes
the
corpse
was
placed
on
its
left
side
with
the
legs
slightly
bent
and
the
right
hand
extending
over
the
left
shoulder
was
inserted
into
a
vase
as
if
to
convey
the
contents
to
the
mouth
vaulted
chambers
are
confined
chiefly
to
the
ancient
cemeteries
of
uru
at
mugheir
they
are
rather
over
six
to
seven
feet
long
with
a
breadth
of
five
and
a
half
feet
the
walls
are
not
quite
perpendicular
but
are
somewhat
splayed
up
to
of
their
height
where
they
begin
to
narrow
into
the
vaulted
roof
the
object
placed
under
the
head
of
the
skeleton
is
the
dried
brick
mentioned
in
the
text
the
vessel
to
which
the
hand
is
stretched
out
was
of
copper
the
other
vessels
were
of
earthenware
and
contained
water
or
dates
of
which
the
stones
were
found
the
small
cylinders
on
the
side
were
of
stone
the
two
large
cylinders
between
the
copper

were
pieces
of

the
food

the

his

fish
fowl

occasionally
also
a

even
stone
representations
of

which
like
those
of
egypt
were
lasting
substitutes
for
the
reality
the
dead
man
required
weapons
also
to
enable
him
to
protect
his
and
his
lance
javelins
and
baton
of
office
were
placed
alongside
him
together
with
a
cylinder
bearing
his
name
which
he
had
employed
as
his
seal
in
his
lifetime
beside
the
body
of
a
woman
or
young
girl
was
arranged
an
abundance
of
spare
ornaments
flowers
combs
cosmetic
pencils
and
cakes
of
the
black
paste
with
which
they
were
accustomed
to
paint

the
eyelids
cremation
seems
in
many
cases
to
have
been
preferred
to
burial
in
a
tomb
the
funeral
pile
was
constructed
at
some
distance
from
the
town
on
a
specially
reserved
area
in
the
middle
of
the
marshes
the
body
wrapped
up
in
coarse
matting
was
placed
upon
a
heap
of
reeds
and
rushes
saturated
with
bitumen
a
brick
wall
coated
with
moist
clay
was
built
around
this
to
circumscribe
the
action
of
the
flames
and
the
customary
prayers
having
been
recited
the
pile
was
set
on
fire
masses
of
fresh
material
together
with
the
funerary
furniture
and
usual
viaticum
being
added
to
the
pyre
when
the
work
of
cremation
was
considered
to
be
complete
the
fire
was
extinguished
and
an
examination
made
of
the
residue
it
frequently
happened
that
only
the
most
accessible
and
most
easily
destroyed
parts
of
the
body
had
been
attacked
by
the
flames
and
that
there
remained
a
black
and
disfigured
mass
which
the
fire
had
not
consumed
the
previously
prepared
coating
of
mud
was
then
made
to
furnish
a
clay
covering
for
the
body
so
as
to
conceal
the
sickening
spectacle
from
the
view
of
the
relatives
and
spectators
sometimes
however
the
furnace
accomplished
its
work
satisfactorily
and
there
was
nothing
to
be
seen
at
the
end
but
greasy
ashes
and
scraps
of
calcined
bones
the
remains
were
frequently
left
where
they
were
and
the
funeral
pile
became
their
tomb
they
were
however
often
collected
and
disposed
of
in
a
manner
which
varied
with
their
more
or
less
complete
combustion
bodies
insufficiently
burnt
were
interred
in
graves
or
in
public
chapels
while
the
ashes
of
those
fully
cremated
together
with
the
scraps
of
bones
and
the
of
the
offerings
were
placed
in
long
urns
the
heat
had
contorted
the
weapons
and
half
melted
the
vessels
of
copper
and
the
deceased
was
thus
obliged
to
be
content
with
the
fragments
only
of
the
things
provided
for
him
these
were
however
sufficient
for
the
purpose
and
his
possessions
once
put
to
the
test
of
the
flames
now
accompanied
him
whither
he
went
water
alone
was
lacking
but
provision
was
made
for
this
by
the
construction
on
the
spot
of
cisterns
to
collect
it
for
this
purpose
several
cylinders
of
pottery
some
twenty
inches
broad
were
inserted
in
the
ground
one
above
the
other
from
a
depth
of
from
ten
to
twelve
feet
and
the
last
cylinder
reaching
the
level
of
the
ground
was
provided
with
a
narrow
neck
through
which
the
rainwater
or
infiltrations
from
the
river
flowed
into
this
novel
cistern
many
examples
of
these
are
found
in
one
and
the
same
chamber
thus
giving
the
soul
an
opportunity
of
finding
water
in
one
or
other
of
them
the
tombs
at
uruk
arranged
closely
together
with
coterminous
walls
and
gradually
covered
by
the
sand
or
by
the
accumulation
and
of
new
tombs
came
at
length
to
form
an
actual
mound
in
cities
where
space
was
less
valuable
and
where
they
were
free
to
extend
the
tombs
quickly
disappeared
without
leaving
any
vestiges
above
the
surface
and
it
would
now
be
necessary
to
turn
up
a
great
deal
of
rubbish
before
discovering
their
remains
the
chaldaea
of
presents
the
singular
aspect
of
a
country
almost
without
cemeteries
and
one
would
be
inclined
to
think
that
its
ancient
inhabitants
had
taken
pains
to
hide
them
the
sepulture
of
royal
personages
alone
furnishes
us
with
monuments
of
which
we
can
determine
the
site
at
babylon
these
were
found
in
the
ancient
palaces
in
which
the
living
were
no
longer
inclined
to
dwell
that
of
shargina
for
instance
furnished
a
for
kings
more
than
two
thousand
years
after
the
death
of
its
founder
the
chronicles
devoutly
indicate
the
spot
where
each
monarch
when
his
earthly
reign
was
over
found
a
last
and
where
as
the
subject
of
a
ceremonial
worship
similar
to
that
of
egypt
his
memory
was
preserved
from
the
oblivion
which
had
overtaken
most
of
his
illustrious
subjects
the
german
expedition
of
found
four
of
these
reservoirs
in
a
single
chamber
and
nine
distributed
in
the
chambers
of
a
house
entirely
devoted
to
the
burial
of
the
dead
various
explanations
have
been
offered
to
account
for
this
absence
of
tombs
without
mentioning
the
desperate
attempt
to
get
rid
of
the
difficulty
by
the
assumption
that
the
dead
bodies
were
cast
into
the
river
loftus
thinks
that
the
chaldaeans
and
assyrians
were
accustomed
to
send
them
to
some
sanctuary
in
southern
chaldaea
especially
to
uru
and
uruk
whose
vast
cemeteries
he
contends
would
have
absorbed
during
the
centuries
the
greater
part
of
the
euphratean
population
his
opinion
has
been
adopted
by
some
historians
and
as
far
only
as
the
later
period
is
concerned
by
hommel
the
dead
man
or
rather
that
part
of
him
which
survived
his
dwelt
in
the
tomb
and
it
was
for
his
comfort
that
there
were
provided
at
the
time
of
sepulture
or
cremation
the
provisions
and
clothing
the
ornaments
and
weapons
of
which
he
was
considered
to
stand
in
need
furnished
with
these
necessities
by
his
children
and
heirs
he
preserved
for
the
donors
the
same
affection
which
he
had
felt
for
them
in
his
lifetime
and
gave
evidence
of
it
in
every
way
he
could
watching
over
their
welfare
and
protecting
them
from
malign
influences
if
they
abandoned
or
forgot
him
he
avenged
himself
for
their
neglect
by
returning
to
torment
them
in
their
homes
by
letting
sickness
attack
them
and
by
ruining
them
with
his
imprecations
he
became
thus
no
less
hurtful
than
the
of
the
egyptians
and
if
he
were
accidentally
deprived
of
sepulture
he
would
not
be
merely
a
plague
to
his
relations
but
a
danger
to
the
entire
city
the
dead
who
were
unable
to
earn
an
honest
living
showed
little
pity
to
those
who
were
in
the
same
position
as
themselves
when
a
arrived
among
them
without
prayers
libations
or
offerings
they
declined
to
receive
him
and
would
not
give
him
so
much
as
a
piece
of
bread
out
of
their
meagre
store
the
spirit
of
the
unburied
dead
man
having
neither
place
of
repose
nor
means
of
subsistence
wandered
through
the
town
and
country
occupied
with
no
other
thought
than
that
of
attacking
and
robbing
the
living
he
it
was
who
gliding
into
the
house
during
the
night
revealed
himself
to
its
inhabitants
with
such
a
frightful
visage
as
to
drive
them
distracted
with
terror
always
on
the
watch
no
sooner
does
he
surprise
one
of
his
victims
than
he
falls
upon
him
head
against
his
head
his
hand
against
his
hand
his
foot
against
his
he
who
has
been
thus
attacked
whether
man
or
beast
would
undoubtedly
perish
if
magic
were
not
able
to
furnish
its
defence
against
this
deadly
embrace
this
human
survival
who
is
so
forcibly
represented
both
in
his
good
and
evil
aspects
was
nevertheless
nothing
more
than
a
sort
of
vague
and
fluid
existence
a
double
in
fact
analogous
in
appearance
to
that
of
the
egyptians
the
majority
of
the
spells
employed
against
sickness
contain
references
to
the
spirits
against
which
they
contend
wicked
ekimmu
who
oppresses
men
during
the
night
or
simply
wicked
ekimmu
the
ghost
with
the
faculty
of
roaming
at
will
through
space
and
of
going
forth
from
and
returning
to
his
abode
it
was
impossible
to
regard
him
as
condemned
always
to
dwell
in
the
case
of
in
which
his
body
lay
mouldering
he
was
transferred
therefore
or
rather
he
transferred
himself
into
the
dark
land
the
aralu
situated
very
far
away
according
to
some
beneath
the
surface
of
the
earth
according
to
others
in
the
eastern
or
northern
extremities
of
the
universe
a
river
which
opens
into
this
region
and
separates
it
from
the
sunlit
earth
finds
its
source
in
the
primordial
waters
into
whose
bosom
this
world
of
ours
is
plunged
this
dark
country
is
surrounded
by
seven
high
walls
and

approached
through

of

the
great
city
and

of

great

whither
everything
which
has
breathed
in
this
world
descends
after
death
a
legend
relates
that
allat
called
in
sumerian
erishkigal
reigned
alone
in
hades
and
was
invited
by
the
gods
to
a
feast
which
they
had
prepared
in
heaven
owing
to
her
hatred
of
the
light
she
sent
a
refusal
by
her
messenger
narntar
who
acquitted
himself
on
this
mission
with
such
a
bad
grace
that
ann
and
ea
were
incensed
against
his
mistress
and
commissioned
nergal
to
descend
and
chastise
her
he
went
and
finding
the
gates
of
hell
open
dragged
the
queen
by
her
hair
from
the
throne
and
was
about
to
decapitate
her
but
she
mollified
him
by
her
prayers
and
saved
her
life
by
becoming
his
wife
the
nature
of
nergal
fitted
him
well
to
play
the
part
of
a
prince
of
the
departed
for
he
was
the
destroying
sun
of
summer
and
the
genius
of
pestilence
and
battle
his
functions
however
in
heaven
and
earth
took
up
so
much
of
his
time
that
he
had
little
leisure
to
visit
his
nether
kingdom
and
he
was
consequently
obliged
to
content
himself
with
the
of
providing
subjects
for
it
by
despatching
thither
the
thousands
of
recruits
which
he
gathered

the
abodes

nothing

an
inexpressible
regret
at

from

excruciating

guarded

at

ancient
legends
related
how
the
shepherd
dumuzi
son
of
ea
and

having
excited
the
love
of
ishtar
while
he
was
pasturing
his

under

mysterious
tree
of

which
covers
the
earth
with
its
shade
was
chosen
by
the
goddess
from
among
all
others
to
be
the
spouse
of
her
youth

how
being
mortally
wounded
by
a

boar
he
was
cast

remained
by
which
he
might
be
restored

his
wounds
must
be
washed
in
the
waters
of
the
wonderful
spring
and
ishtar
resolved
to
go
in
quest
of
this
marvellous
liquid
the
undertaking
was
fraught
with
danger
for
no
one
might
travel
to
the
infernal
regions
without
having
previously
gone
through
the
extreme
terrors
of
death

it
follows
from
this
passage
that
ishtar
could
be
delivered
only
at
the
cost
of
another
life
it
was
for
this
reason
doubtless
that
ea
instead
of

was

it
had
to

this
prospect
of

was
not
so

as
it
was
to
the

endless
ages

were

they
were

the

laying
up

treasure
of
felicity
their
store
would
have
no
current
value
beyond
the
tomb
and
would
thus
become
so
much
waste
the
gods
therefore
whom
they
served
faithfully
would
recoup
them
here
in
their
native
city
with
present
prosperity
with
health
riches
power
glory
and
a
numerous
offspring
for
the
offerings
of
their
devotion
while
if
they
irritated
the
deities
by
their
shortcomings
they
had
nothing
to
expect
but
overwhelming
calamities
and
sufferings
the
gods
would
them
down
like
a
reed
and
their
would
be
annihilated
their
seed
destroyed
they
would
end
their
days
in
affliction
and
hunger

dead
bodies
would
be
at
the

were

to
resign
themselves
therefore
to
the
dreary
lot
of
eternal
misery
which
awaited
them
after
death
provided
they
enjoyed
in
this
world
a
long
and
prosperous
existence
some
of
them
felt
and
rebelled
against
the
injustice
of
the
idea
which
assigned
one

the

fate
without

to

of

where
this

flows
into

sea
afterwards
when
the
country
became
better
known
it
was
transferred
beyond
the
ocean
in
proportion
as
the
limits
of
the
chaldaean
horizon
were
thrust
further
and
further
away
by
mercantile
or
warlike
expeditions
this
mysterious
island
was
placed
more
and
more
to
the
east
afterwards
to
the
north
and
at
length
at
a
distance
so
great
that
it
tended
to
vanish
altogether
as
a
final
resource
the
gods
of
heaven
themselves
became
the
hosts
and
welcomed
into
their
own
kingdom
the
purified
souls
of

heroes

souls
were
not
so
securely
isolated
from

that
the

of

were
not
at
times
tempted
to
rejoin
them
before

rendered
to
the

that
his
wife
could
not
bring
forth
the
son
which
lay
in
her
womb
the
hero
addressing
himself
to
the
eagle
asked
from
her
the
plant
which
alleviates
the
of
women
and
facilitates
their
delivery
this
was
only
to
be
found
however
in

any
one
run
the
risk
of
mounting
so
high
without
being
destroyed
on
the
way
by

anger
of

escaped

soon
suffered
a

was
at

with

the
records
which
we
as
yet
possess
do
not
vouchsafe
the
reason
when
she
discovered
in
the
roots
of
a
tree
the
nest
in
which
her
enemy
concealed
its
brood
she
immediately
proposed
to
her
young
ones
to
pounce
down
upon
the
growing
snakes
one
of
her
eaglets
wiser
than
the
rest
reminded
her
that
they
were
under
the
protection
of
shamash
the
great
righter
of
wrongs
and
cautioned
her
against
any
transgression
of
the
divine
laws
the
old
eagle
felt
herself
wiser
than
her
son
and
rebuked
him
after
the
manner
of
wise
mothers
she
carried
away
the
young
and
gave
them
as
food
to
her
own
brood
the
hissing
serpent
crawled
as
far
as
shamash
crying
for
vengeance
evil
she
has
done

come

shamash
thy

the
criminal
zu

who
was
the
first
to
act
wickedly
did
he
escape
it
shamash
refused
to
interfere
personally
but
he
pointed
out
to
the
serpent
an
artifice
by
which
he
might
satisfy
his
vengeance
as
securely
as
if
shamash
himself
had
accomplished
it

thyself
in

all
the

of

will
pounce
upon
it
and
the
eagle
herself
will
come
with
them
ignorant
that
thou
art
within
it
she
will
wish
to
possess
herself
of
the
flesh
she
will
come
swiftly
she
will
think
of
nothing
but
the
entrails
within
as
soon
as
she
begins
to
attack
the
inside
seize
her
by
her
wings

down
her
wings
the
pinions
of
her
wings
and
her
claws
tear
her
and
throw
her
into
a
ravine
of
the
mountain
that
she
may
die
there
a
death
of
hunger
and
the
serpent
did
as
shamash
advised
and
the
birds
of
the
air
began
to
flock
round
the
carcase
in
which
she
was
hidden
the
eagle
came
with
the
rest
and
at
first
kept
aloof
looking
for
what
should
happen
when
she
saw
that
the
birds
flew
away
unharmed
all
fear
left
her
in
vain
did
the
wise
eaglet
warn
her
of
the
danger
that
was
lurking
within
the
prey
she
mocked
at
him
and
his
predictions
dug
her
beak
into
the
carrion
and
the
serpent
leaping
out
seized
her
by
the
wing
then
eagle
her
mouth
opened
and
spake
unto
the
snake
mercy
upon
me
and
according
to
thy
pleasure
a
gift
i
will
lavish
upon
thee
the
snake
opened
her
mouth
and
spake
unto
the
eagle
i
release
thee
shamash
would
take
part
against
me
and
the
doom
would
fall
upon
me
which
now
i
fulfil
upon
she
tore
out
her
wings
her
feathers
her
pinions
she
tore
her
to
pieces
she
threw
her
into
a
cleft
and
there
she
died
a
death
of
hunger
and
of
the
gods
allowed
no
living
being
to
penetrate
with
impunity
into
their
empire
he
who
was
desirous
of
ascending
thither
however
brave
he
might
be
could
do
so
only
by
death
the
mass
of
humanity
had
no
pretensions
to
mount
so
high
their
religion
gave
them
the
choice
between
a
perpetual
abode
in
the
tomb
or
confinement
in
the
prison
of
allat
if
at
times
they
strove
to
escape
from
these
alternatives
and
to
picture
otherwise
their
condition
in
the
world
beyond
their
ideas
as
to
the
other
life
continued
to
remain
vague
and
never
approached
the
minute
precision
of
the
egyptian
conception
the
cares
of
the
present
life
were
too
absorbing
to
allow
them
leisure
to

the

chaldaean
commerce
and
the
chaldaean
kings
unlike
their
contemporaries
the
pharaohs
rarely
put
forward
any
pretensions
to
divinity
they
contented
themselves
with
occupying
an
intermediate
position
between
their
subjects
and
the
gods
and
for
the
purpose
of
mediation
they
believed
themselves
to
be
endowed
with
powers
not
possessed
by
ordinary
mortals
they
sometimes
designated
themselves
the
sons
of
ea
or
of
ninsun
or
some
other
deity
but
this
involved
no
belief
in
a
divine
parentage
and
was
merely
pious
hyperbole
they
entertained
no
illusions
with
regard
to
any
descent
from
a
god
or
even
from
one
of
his
doubles
but
they
desired
to
be
recognized
as
his
vicegerents
here
below
as
his
prophets
his
his
pastors
elected
by
him
to
rule
his
human
flocks
or
as
priests
devotedly
attached
to
his
service
while
however
the
ordinary
priest
chose
for
himself
a
single
master
to
whom
he
devoted
himself
the
exercised
universal
sacerdotal
functions
and
claimed
to
be
pontiff
of
all
the
national
religions
his
choice
naturally
was
directed
by
preference
to
the
patrons
of
his
city
those
who
had
raised
his
ancestors
from
the
dust
and
had
exalted
him
to
the
supreme
rank
but
there
were
other
divinities
who
claimed
their
share
of
his
homage
and
expected
of
him
a
devotion
suited
to
their
importance
if
he
had
attempted
to
carry
out
these
duties
personally
in
detail
he
would
have
had
to
spend
his
whole
life
at
the
foot
of
the
altar
even
when
he
had
delegated
as
many
of
them
as
he
could
to
the
regular
clergy
there
still
remained
sufficient
to
occupy
a
large
part
of
his
time

month
every
day
brought
its
inevitable
round
of
sacrifices
prayers
and
processions
on
the
of
the
second
elul
the
king
of
babylon
had
to
present
a
gazelle
without
blemish
to
sin
he
then
made
an
offering
of
his
own
choosing
to
shamash
and
cut
the
throats
of
his
victims
before
the
god
these
ceremonies
were
repeated
on
the
without
any
alteration
but
from
the
to
the
they
took
place
during
the
night
before
the
statues

of

constellation
as
for

that
of
the

or
that
of
the

of

sometimes
at
the
moment
when
the
moon
above

her
luminous
on
such
a
date
a
penitential
psalm
or
a
litany
was
to

edict
or
to

only
at

but
everywhere
else
obedience
to
the
religious
rites
weighed
heavily
on
the
local
princes
at
uru
at
lagash
at
nipur
and
in
the
ruling
cities
of
upper
and
lower
chaldaea
the
king
as
soon
as
he
succeeded
to
the
throne
repaired
to
the
temple
to
receive
his
solemn
investiture
which
differed
in
form
according
to
the
gods
he
worshipped
at
babylon
he
addressed
himself
to
the
statue
of
in
the
first
days
of
the
month

which
followed
his
accession
and
he
him
by
the
to
do
homage
to
him
from
thenceforth
he
officiated
for
merodach
here
below
and
the
scrupulously
minute
devotions
which
daily
occupied
hours
of
his
time
were
so
many
acts
of
allegiance
which
his
fealty
as
a
vassal
constrained
him
to
perform
to
his
suzerain
they
were
in
fact
analogous
to
the
daily
audiences
demanded
of
a
great
lord
by
his
steward
for
the
purpose
of
rendering
his
accounts
and
of
informing
him
of
current
business
any
interruption
not
justified
by
a
matter
of
supreme
importance
would
be
liable
to
be
interpreted
as
a
want
of
respect
or
as
revealing
an
inclination
to
rebel
by
neglecting
the
slightest
ceremonial
detail
the
king
would
arouse
the
suspicions
of
the
gods
and
excite
their
anger
against
himself
and
his
subjects
the
people
had
therefore
a
direct
interest
in
his
careful
fulfilment
of
the
priestly
functions
and
his
piety
was
not
the
least
of
his
virtues
in
their
eyes
all
other
virtues
bravery
equity
justice
depended
on
it
and
were
only
valuable
from
the
divine
aid
which
piety
obtained
for
them
the
gods
and
heroes
of
the
earliest
ages
had
taken
upon
themselves
the
task
of
protecting
the
faithful
from
all
their
enemies
whether
men
or
beasts
if
a
lion
decimated
their
flocks
or
a
urus
of
gigantic
size
devastated
their
crops
it
was
the
duty
to
follow
the
example
of
his
fabulous
predecessors
and
to
set
out
and
overcome
them
the
enterprise
demanded
all
the
more
courage
and
supernatural
help
since
these
beasts
were
believed
to
be
no
mere
ordinary
animals
but
were
looked
on
as
instruments
of
divine
wrath
the
cause
of
which
was
often
unknown
and
whoever
assailed
these
monsters
provoked
not
only
them
but
the
god
who
instigated
them
piety
and
confidence
in
the
patron
of
the
city
alone
sustained
the
king
when
he
set
forth
to
drive
the
animal
back
to
its
lair
he
engaged
in
close
combat
with
it
and
no
sooner
had
he
pierced
it
with
his
arrows
or
his
lance
or
felled
it
with
axe
and
dagger
than
he
hastened
to
pour
a
libation
upon
it
and
to
dedicate
it
as
a
trophy
in
one
of
the
temples
his
exalted
position
entailed
on
him
no
less
perils
in
time
of
war
if
he
did
not
personally
direct
the
first
attacking
column
he
placed
himself
at
the
head
of
the
band
composed
of
the
flower
of
the
army
whose
charge
at
an
opportune
moment
was
wont
to
secure
the
victory
what
would
have
been
the
use
of
his
valour
if
the
dread
of
the
gods
had
not
preceded
his
march
and
if
the
light
of
their
countenances
had
not
struck
terror
into
the
ranks
of
the
enemy
as
soon
as
he
had
triumphed
by
their
command
he
sought
before
all
else
to
reward
them
amply
for
the
assistance
they
had
given
him
he
poured
a
tithe
of
the
spoil
into
the
coffers
of
their
treasury
he
made
over
a
part
of
the
conquered
country
to
their
domain
he
granted
them
a
tale
of
the
prisoners
to
cultivate
their
lands
or
to
work
at
their
buildings
even
the
idols
of
the
vanquished
shared
the
fate
of
their
people
the
king
tore
them
from
the
sanctuaries
which
had
hitherto
sheltered
them
and
took
them
as
prisoners
in
his
train
to
form
a
court
of
captive
gods
about
his
patron
divinity
shamash
the
great
judge
of
heaven
inspired
him
with
justice
and
the
prosperity
which
his
good
administration
obtained
for
the
people
was
less
the
work
of
the
sovereign
than
that
of
the
immortals
we
know
too
little
of
the
inner
family
life
of
the
kings
to
attempt
to
say
how
they
were
able
to
combine
the
strict
sacerdotal
obligations
incumbent
on
them
with
the
routine
of
daily
life
we
merely
observe
that
on
great
days
of
festival
or
sacrifice
when
they
themselves
officiated
they
laid
aside
all
the
insignia
of
royalty
during
the
ceremony
and
were
clad
as
ordinary
priests
we
see
them
on
such
occasions
represented
with
hair
and
naked
breast
the
about
their
waist
advancing
foremost
in
the
rank
carrying
the
heavily
laden
or
reed
basket
as
if
they
were
ordinary
slaves
and
as
a
fact
they
had
for
the
moment
put
aside
their
sovereignty
and
were
merely
temple
servants
or
slaves
appearing
before
their
divine
master
to
do
his
bidding
and
disguising
themselves
for
the
nonce
in
the

the

not
seem
to
have
been
invested
with
that
character
which
led
the
egyptian
women
to
be
associated
with
the
devotions
of
the

and
made
them
indispensable
auxiliaries
in
all
religious
ceremonies

did
not

occupy
that
important
position
side
by
side
with
the

which
the
egyptian
law
assigned
to
the
queens
of

princesses

spoke

as
little
as

those
in
power
avoided
associating
them
in
any
public
acts
of
worship
or
government
and
we
could
count
on
our
fingers
the
number
of
those
whom
the
inscriptions
mention
by
name
some
of
them
were
drawn
from
the
noble
families
of
the
capital
others
came
from
the
kingdoms
of
chaldaea
or
from
foreign
courts
a
certain
number
never
rose
above
the
condition
of
mere
concubines
many
assumed
the
title
of
queen
while
almost
all
served
as
living
pledges
of
alliances
made
with
rival
states
or
had
been
given
as
hostages
at
the
concluding
of
a
peace
on
the
termination
of
a
war
as
the
kings
who
put
forward
no
pretensions
to
a
divine
origin
were
not
constrained
after
the
fashion
of
the
pharaohs
to
marry
their
sisters
in
order
to
keep
up
the
purity
of
their
race
it
was
rare
to
find
one
among
their
wives
who
possessed
an
equal
right
to
the
crown
with
themselves
such
a
case
could
be
found
only
in
troublous
times
when
an
aspirant
to
the
throne
of
base
extraction
legitimated
his
usurpation
by
marrying
a
sister
or
daughter
of
his
predecessor
political
between
egypt
and
chaldaea
were
of
frequent
occurrence
according
to
the
tel
tablets
and
at
a
later
period
between
chaldaea
and
assyria
among
the
few
queens
of
the
very
earliest
times
the
wife
of
nammaghani
is
the
daughter
of
urbau
vicegerent
of
lagash
and
consequently
the
cousin
or
niece
of
her
husband
while
the
wife
of
rimsin
appears
to
be
the
daughter
of
a
nobleman
of
the
name
of
rimnannar
the
original
status
of
the
mother
almost
always
determined
that
of
her
children
and
the
sons
of
a
princess
were
born
princes
even
if
their
father
were
of
obscure
or
unknown
origin
these
princes
exercised
important
functions
at
court
or
they
received
possessions
which
they
administered
under
the
suzerainty
of
the
head
of
the
family
the
daughters
were
given
to
foreign
kings
or
to
scions
of
the
most
distinguished
families
the
sovereign
was
under
no
obligation
to
hand
down
his
crown
to
any
particular
member
of
his
family
the
eldest
son
usually
succeeded
him
but
the
king
could
if
he
preferred
select
his
favourite
child
as
his
successor
even
if
he
happened
to
be
the
youngest
or
the
only
one
born
of
a
slave
as
soon
as
the
sovereign
had
made
known
his
will
the
custom
of
primogeniture
was
set
aside
and
his
word
became
law
we
can
well
imagine
the
secret
intrigues
formed
both
by
mothers
and
sons
to
curry
favour
with
the
father
and
bias
his
choice
we
can
picture
the
jealousy
with
which
they
mutually
watched
each
other
and
the
bitter
hatred
which
any
preference
shown
to
one
would
arouse
in
the
breasts
of
all
the
others
often
brothers
who
had
been
disappointed
in
their
expectations
would
combine
secretly
against
the
chosen
or
supposed
heir
a
conspiracy
would
break
out
and
the
people
suddenly
learn
that
their
ruler
of
yesterday
had
died
by
the
hand
of
an
assassin
and
that
a
new
one
filled
his
place
this
fact
is
apparent
from
the
introduction
to
the
inscription
in
which
sargon
is
supposed
to
give
an
account
of
his
life
father
was
unknown
my
mother
was
a
princess
and
it
was
indeed
from
his
mother
that
he
inherited
his
rights
to
the
crown
of
agade
sometimes
discontent
spread
beyond
the
confines
of
the
palace
the
army
became
divided
into
two
hostile
camps
the
citizens
took
the
side
of
one
or
other
of
the
aspirants
and
civil
war
raged
for
several
years
till
some
decisive
action
brought
it
to
a
close
meantime
tributary
vassals
took
advantage
of
the
consequent
disorder
to
shake
off
the
yoke
the
blamites
and
various
neighbouring
cities
joined
in
the
dispute
and
ranged
themselves
on
the
side
of
the
party
from
which
there
was
most
to
be
gained
the
victorious
faction
always
had
to
pay
dearly
for
this
somewhat
dubious
help
and
came
out
impoverished
from
the
struggle
such
an
internecine
war
often
caused
the
downfall
of
a
dynasty
at
times
indeed
that
of
the
entire
state
the
above
is
perfectly
true
of
the
later
assyrian
and
chalaean
periods
it
is
scarcely
needful
to
recall
to
the
reader
the
murders
of
sargon
ii
and
sennacherib
or
the
revolt
of
assurdainpal
against
his
father
shalmaneser
iii
with
regard
to
the
earliest
period
we
have
merely
indications
of
what
took
place
the
succession
of
king
urnina
of
lagash
appears
to
have
been
accompanied
by
troubles
of
this
kind
and
it
is
certain
that
his
successor
akurgal
was
not
the
eldest
of
his
sons
but
we
do
not
at
present
know
to
what
events
akurgal
owed
his
elevation
the
palaces
of
the
chaldaean
kings
like
those
of
the
egyptians
presented
the
appearance
of
an
actual
citadel
the
walls
had
to
be
sufficiently
thick
to
withstand
an
army
for
an
indefinite
period
and
to
protect
the
garrison
from
every
emergency
except
that
of
treason
or
famine
one
of
the
statues
found
at
telloh
holds
in
its
lap
the
plan
of
one
of
these
residences
the
external
outline
alone
is
given
but
by
means
of
it
we
can
easily
picture
to
ourselves
a
fortified
place
with
its
towers
its
forts
and
its
gateways
placed
between
two
bastions
it
represents
the
ancient
palace
of
lagash
subsequently
enlarged
and
altered
by
oudea
or
one
of
the
vicegerents
who
succeeded
him
in
which
many
a
great
lord
of
the
place
must
have
resided
down
to
the
time
of
the
christian
era
the
site
on
which
it
was
built
in
the
girsu
quarter
of
the
city
was
not
entirely
unoccupied
at
the
time
of
its
foundation
urbau
had
raised
a
ziggurat
on
that
very
spot
some
centuries
previously
and
the
walls
which
he
had
constructed
were
falling
into
ruin

scale

lying

of
the

petrie
has
shown
that
the
unit
of
measurement
represented
on
this
ruler
is
the
cubit
of
the
of
te
gudea
did
not
destroy
the
work
of
his
remote
predecessor
he
merely
incorporated
it
into
the
substructures
of
the
new
building
thus
showing
an
indifference
similar
to
that
evinced
by
the
pharaohs
for
the
monuments
of
a
former
dynasty
the
palaces
like
the
temples
never
rose
directly
from
the
soil
but
were
invariably
built
on
the
top
of
an
artificial
mound
of
crude
brick
at
lagash
this
solid
platform
rises
to
the
height
of
feet
above
the
plain
and
the
only
means
of
access
to
the
top
is
by
a
single
narrow
steep
staircase
easily
cut
off
or
defended
illustration
drawn
by
from
the
facsimile

the
palace
which
surmounts
this
artificial
eminence

a
sort
of
irregular
rectangle
feet
long
by
feet
wide
and
had
contrary
to
the
custom
in
egypt
the
four
angles
orientated
to
the
four
cardinal
points
the
two
principal
sides
are
not
parallel
but
swell
out
slightly
towards
the
middle
and
the
flexion
of
the
lines
almost
follows
the
contour
of
one
of
those
little
clay
cones
upon
which
the
kings
were
wont
to
inscribe
their
annals
or
dedications
this
flexure
was
probably
not
intentional
on
the
part
of
the
architect
but
was
owing
to
the
difficulty
of
keeping
a
wall
of
such
considerable
extent
in
a
straight
line
from
one
end
to
another
and
all
eastern
nations
whether
chaldaeans
or
egyptians
troubled
themselves
but
little
about
correctness
of
alignment
since
defects
of
this
kind
were
scarcely
ever
perceptible
in
the
actual
edifice
and
are
only
clearly
revealed
in
the
plan
drawn
out
to
scale
with
modern
precision
mons
heuzey
thinks
that
the
outward
deflection
of
the
lines
is
owing
to
a
primitive
method
of
obtaining
greater
solidity
of
construction
and
of
giving
a
better
foundation
to
these
long
facades
which
are
placed
upon
artificial
terraces
of
crude
brick
always
subject
to
cracks
and
i
think
that
the
explanation
of
the
facts
which
i
have
given
in
the
text
is
simpler
than
that
ingeniously
proposed
by
mons
heuzey
the
masons
having
begun
to
build
the
wall
at
one
end
were
unable
to
carry
it
on
in
a
straight
line
until
it
reached
the
spot
denoted
on
the
plan
and
therefore
altered
the
direction
of
the
wall
when
they
detected
their
error
or
having
begun
to
build
the
wall
from
both
ends
simultaneously
were
not
successful
in
making
the
two
lines
meet
correctly
and
they
have
frankly
patched
up
the
junction
by
a
mass
of
projecting
brickwork
which
conceals
their
unskilfulness

the
sacred
tower
was
of
older
date
than

possibly
formed
part
of
the
ancient
building
of
urbau
it
was
originally
composed
of
three
stories
but
the
lower
one
was
altered
by
gudea
and
disappeared
entirely
in
the
thickness
of
the
basal
platform
the
second
story
thus
became
the
bottom
one
it
was
enlarged
slightly
raised
above
the
neighbouring
roofs
and
was
probably
crowned
by
a
sanctuary
dedicated
to
ningirsu
it
was
indeed
a
monument
of
modest
proportions
and
most
of
the
public
temples
soared
far
above
it

it
was

the

bordered
the

should
a
troop

enemies
venture
within
the
range
of
sight
or
should
a
suspicious
tumult
arise
within
the
city
the
watchers
posted
on
the
highest
terrace
would
immediately
give
the
alarm
and
their
warning
the
king
would
have
time
to
close
his
gates
and
take
measures
to
resist
the
invading
enemy
or
crush
the

the

had
an

by

passage
issuing
on

also
communicated
with

the

eight

guarded

carefully
as

these
comprised
a

some

a
kitchen
a

and
a

through
which
the

could
come
and

without

the
whole
description
in
no
way
corresponds
with
the
marvellous
ideal
of
an
oriental
palace
which
we
form
for
ourselves
the
apartments
are
mean
and
dismal
imperfectly
lighted
by
the

or
by
some
small
aperture
timidly
cut
in
the
ceiling
arranged
so
as
to
protect
the
inmates
from
the
heat
and
dust
but
without
a
thought
given
to
luxury
or
display
the
walls
were
entirely
void
of
any
cedar
woodwork
inlaid
with
gold
or
panels
of
mosaic
such
as
we
find
in
the
temples
nor
were
they
hung
with
dyed
or
embroidered
draperies
such
as
we
moderns
love
to
imagine
and
which
we
spread
about
in
profusion
when
we
attempt

reproduce
the

an
ancient

the

however
which
are
full
of
minute
details
with
regard
to
the
construction
and
ornamentation
of
the
temples
and
palaces
have
hitherto
contained
nothing
which
would
lead
us
to
infer
that
hangings
were
used
for
mural
decoration
in
chaldoa
or
assyria
the
walls
had
to
remain
bare
for
the
sake
of
coolness
at
the
most
they
were
only
covered
with
a
coat
of
white
plaster
on
which
were
painted
in
one
or
two
colours
some
scene
of
civil

religious
life
or
troops
of
fantastic
monsters
struggling
with
one
another
or
men
each
with
a
bird
seated
on

the
furniture
was
not
less
scanty
than

there
were

on
the

in
which
were
kept
the

and

inlaid
with

united

in
outline
and
making
us
ask
if
they
were
brought
into
chaldaea
by
caravans
or
made
from
models
which
had
come
from
some
other
country
a
few
rare
objects
of
artistic
character
might
be
found
which
bore
witness
to
a
certain
taste
for
elegance
and
refinement
as
for
instance
a
kind
of
circular
trough
of
black
stone
probably
used
to
support
a
vase
three
rows
of
imbricated
scales
surrounded
the
base
of
this
while
seven
small
sitting
figures
lean
back
against
the
upper
part
with
an
air
of
satisfaction
which
is
most
cleverly
rendered
the
decoration
of
the
larger
chambers
used
for
public
receptions
and
official
ceremonies
while
never
assuming
the
monumental
character
which
we
observe
in
contemporary
egyptian
buildings
afforded
more
scope
for
richness
and
variety
than
was
offered
by

limestone
let
into

affixed

its
surface

in
a
more
or
less
artless
fashion
the
figure
of
the

officiating
before
some

took

were
placed
in
full
view
upon
bronze
statues
of
divinities
or
priests
fixed
into
the
ground
or
into
some
part
of
the
masonry
as
magical
nails
destined
to
preserve
the
bricks
from
destruction
and
consequently
to
keep
the
memory
of
the
dedicator
continually
before
posterity
stelaa
engraved
on
both

recalled
the

of
past
times
the
the
scenes
of

which
took
place
there
and
the
return
of
the
victor
and
his
triumph
sitting
or
standing
figures
of
diorite
silicious
sandstone
or
hard
limestone
bearing
inscriptions
on
their
robes
or
shoulders
perpetuated
the
features
of
the
founder
or
of
members
of
his
family
and
commemorated
the
pious
donations
which
had
obtained
for
him
the
favour
of
the
gods
the
palace
of
lagash
contained
dozens
of
such
statues
several
of
which
have
come
down
to
us
almost
intact
one
of
the
ancient
urbau
and
nine
of
gudea
to
judge
by
the
space
covered
and
the
arrangement
of
the
rooms
the
vicegerents
of
lagash
and
the
chiefs
of
towns
of
minor
importance
must
as
a
rule
have
been
content
with
a
comparatively
small
number
of
servants
their
court
probably
resembled
that
of
the
egyptian
barons
who
lived
much
about
the
same
period
such
as
khnumhotpu
of
the
nome
of
the
gazelle
or
thothotpu
of
hermopolis
in
great
cities
such
as
babylon
the
palace
occupied
a
much
larger
area
and
the
crowd
of
courtiers
was
doubtless
as
great
as
that
which
thronged
about
the
pharaohs
no
exact
enumeration
of
them
has
come
down
to
us
but
the
titles
which
we
come
across
show
with
what
minuteness
they
defined
the
offices
about
the
person
of
the
sovereign
his
costume
alone
required
almost
as
many
persons
as
there
were
garments
the
men
wore
the
light
or
tunic
which
scarcely
covered
the
knees
after
the
fashion
of
the
egyptians
they
threw
over
the
and
the
tunic
a
large
whose
shape
and
material
varied
with
the
caprice
of
fashion
they
often
chose
for
this
purpose
a
sort
of
shawl
of
a
plain
material
fringed
or
ornamented
with
a
flat
stripe
round
the
edge
often
they
seem
to
have
preferred
it
ribbed
or
artificially
kilted
from
top
to
bottom
the
relatively
modern
costume
was
described
by
herodotus
i
it
was
almost
identical
with
the
ancient
one
as
proved
by
the
representations
on
the
cylinders
and
monuments
of
telloh
the
tunic
is
more
rarely
represented
and
the
is
usually
hidden
under
the
abayah
in
the
case
of
nobles
and
kings
we
see
the
princes
of
lagash
wearing
the
simple
on
the
monuments
of
urnina
for
example
for
the
egyptian
abayah
and
the
manner
of
representing
it
cf
vol
pp
the
favourite
material
in
ancient
times
however
seems
to
have
been
a
hairy
shaggy
cloth
or
woollen
stuff
whose
close
fleecy
thread
hung
sometimes
straight
sometimes
crimped
or
waved
in
regular
rows
like
flounces
one
above
another
this
could
be
arranged
squarely
around
the
neck
like
a
mantel
but
was
more
often
draped
crosswise
over
the
left
shoulder
and
brought
under
the
right
so
as
to
leave
the
upper
part
of
the
breast
and
the
arm
bare
on
that
side
it
made
a
convenient
and
useful
garment
an
excellent
protection
in
summer
from
the
sun
and
from
the
icy
north
wind
in
the
winter
the
feet
were
shod
with
sandals
a
cap
covered
the
head
and
round
it
was
rolled
a
thick
strip
of
linen
forming
a
sort
of
rudimentary
turban
which
completed
the
costume
the
head
belonging
to
one
of
the
statues
of
telloh
which
is
reproduced
on
of
this
volume
we
notice
the
same
on
several
intaglios
and
monuments
and
also
on
the
plaque
which
will
be
found
on
of
this
volume
and
which
represents
a
herdsman
wrestling
with
a
lion
until
we
have
further
evidence
we
can
not
state
as
did
that
this
strip
forming
a
turban
was
of
hair
the
date
of
the
introduction
of
the
camel
into
chaldoa
still
remains
uncertain
it
is
questionable
whether
as
in
egypt
wigs
and
false
beards
formed
part
of
the
toilette
on
some
monuments
we
notice
smooth
faces
and
heads
on
others
the
men
appear
with
long
hair
either
falling
loose
or
twisted
into
a
knot
on
the
back
of
the
neck
while
the
egyptians
delighted
in
garments
of
thin
white
linen
but
slightly
plaited
or
crimped
the
dwellers
on
the
banks
of
the
euphrates
preferred
thick
and
heavy
stuffs
patterned
and
striped
with
many
colours
the
kings
wore
the
same
costume
as
their
subjects
but
composed
of
richer
and
finer
materials
dyed
red
or
blue
decorated
with
floral
animal
or
geometrical
designs
a
high
tiara
covered
the
forehead
unless
replaced
by
a
diadem
of
sin
or
some
of
the
other
gods
which
was
a
conical
mitre
supporting
a
double
pair
of
horns
and
sometimes
surmounted
by
a
sort
of
diadem
of
feathers
and
mysterious
figures
embroidered
or
painted
on

were
loaded
with

with

they
wore
necklaces

a

detect

are
effaced
by
the
distance

time
and
we
are
struck
merely
by
the
resemblances
as
all
business
transactions
were
carried
on
by
barter
or
by
the
exchange
of
merchandise
for
weighed
quantities
of
the
precious

as

hence
we
continually
come
across
fiscal
storehouses
both
in

demanded

services
of
a
whole
troop
of
functionaries
and
workmen
administrators
of
corn

precious
metals

and
oil
in

as
many

as
there
were
cultures

presided
over
the
gathering
of
the
products
into
the
central
depots

was

and
the

of
the

engaged
in

the
surplus

and

not
drawn

in
cases
of
extreme
necessity

palace
in
addition

a
fortress

requisites

a
prolonged
siege
either
against

troops
or
the
own

always
kept
about
him
bodies
of

perhaps
were
foreign

war
was
imminent
a
military
levy
was
made
upon
his
domains
but
we
are
unable
to
find
out
whether
the
recruits
thus
raised
were
drawn
indiscriminately
from
the
population
in
general
or
merely
from
a
special
class
analogous
to
that
of
the
warriors
which
we
find
in
egypt
who
were
paid
in
the
same
way
by
grants
of
land
the
equipment
of
these
soldiers
was
of
the
rudest
kind
they
had
no
cuirass
but
carried
a
rectangular
shield
and
in
the
case
of
those
of
higher
rank
at
all
events
a
conical
metal
helmet
probably
of
beaten
copper
provided
with
a
piece
to
protect
the
back
of
the
neck
the
heavy
infantry
were
armed
with
a
pike
tipped
with
bronze
an
axe
or
sharp
adze
a
mace
and
a
dagger
the
light
troops
were
provided
only
with
the
bow
and
sling
as
early
as
the
third
millennium
the
king
went
to
battle
in
a
chariot
drawn
by
onagers
or
perhaps
horses
he
had
his
own
peculiar
weapon
which
was
a
curved
baton
probably
terminating
in
a
metal
point
and
resembling
the
sceptre
of
the
pharaohs
considerable
quantities
of
all
these
arms
were
stored
in
the
arsenals
which
contained
depots
for
bows
maces
and
pikes
and
even
the
stones
needed
for
the
slings
had
their
special
department
for
storage
at
the
beginning
of
each
campaign
a
distribution
of
weapons
to
the
newly
levied
troops
took
place
but
as
soon
as
the
war
was
at
an
end
the
men
brought
back
their
accoutrements
which
were
stored
till
they
were
again
required
the
valour
of
the
soldiers
and
their
chiefs
was
then
rewarded
the
share
of
the
spoil
for
some

of
cattle
gold
corn
a
female
slave
and
vessels
of
value
for
others
lands
or
towns
in
the
conquered
country

by
the
rank
of
the
recipients
or
the
extent
of
the
services
they
had
rendered
illustration
a
soldier
bringing
prisoners
and
spoil

by
from
the
chaldaean
intaglio
in
the
british
museum
property
thus
given
was
hereditary
and
privileges
were
often
added
to
it
which
raised
the
holder
to
the
rank
of
a
petty
prince
for
instance
no
royal
official
was
permitted
to
impose
a
tax
upon
such
lands
or
take
the
cattle
off
them
or
levy
provisions
upon
them
no
troop
of
soldiers
might
enter
them
not
even
for
the
purpose
of
arresting
a
fugitive
most
of
the
noble
families
possessed
domains
of
this
kind
and
constituted
in
each
kingdom
a
powerful
and
wealthy
feudal
aristocracy
whose
relations
to
their
sovereign
were
probably
much
the
same
as
those
which
bound
the
nomarchs
to
the
pharaoh
the
position
of
these
nobles
was
not
more
stable
than
that
of
the
dynasties
under
which
they
lived
while
some
among
them
gained
power
by
marriages
or
by
continued
acquisitions
of
land
others
fell
into
disgrace
and
were
ruined
as
the
soil
belonged
to
the
gods
it
is
possible
that
these
nobles
were
supposed
in
theory
depend
upon
the
gods
but
as
the
kings
were
the
vicegerents
of
the
gods
upon
earth
it
was
to
the
king
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
they
owed
their
elevation
every
state
therefore
comprised
two
parts
each
subject
to
a
distinct
regime
one
being
the
personal
domain
of
the
suzerain
which
he
managed
himself
and
from
which
he
drew
the
revenues
the
other
was
composed
of
fiefs
whose
lords
paid
tribute
and
owed
certain
obligations
to
the
king
the
nature
of
which
we
are
as
yet
unable
to
define
the
chaldaean
like
the
egyptian
scribe
was
the
pivot
on
which
the
machinery
of
this
double
royal
and
seignorial
administration
turned
he
does
not
appear
to
have
enjoyed
as
much
consideration
as
his
in
the
nile
valley
the
chaldaean
princes
nobles
priests
soldiers
and
temple
or
royal
officials
did
not
covet
the
title
of
scribe
or
pride
themselves
upon
holding
that
office
side
by
side
with
their
other
dignities
as
we
see
was
the
case
with
their
egyptian
contemporaries
the
position
of
a
scribe
nevertheless
was
an
important
one
we
continually
meet
with
it
in
all
grades
of
society
in
the
palace
in
the
temples
in
the
storehouses
in
private
dwellings
in
fine
the
scribe
was
ubiquitous
at
court
in
the
town
in
the
country
in
the
army
managing
affairs
both
small
and
great
and
seeing
that
they
were
carried
on
regularly
his
education
differed
but
little
from
that
given
to
the
egyptian
scribe
he
learned
the
routine
of
administrative
or
judicial
affairs
the
formularies
for
correspondence
either
with
nobles
or
with
ordinary
people
the
art
of
writing
of
calculating
quickly
and
of
making
out
bills
correctly
we
may
well
ask
whether
he
ever
employed
papyrus
or
prepared
skins
for
these
purposes
it
would
indeed
seem
strange
that
after
centuries
of
intercourse
no
caravan
should
have
brought
into
chaldaean
any
of
those
materials
which
were
in
such
constant
use
for
literary
purposes
in
africa
yet
the
same
clay
which
furnished
the
architect
with
such
an
abundant
building
material
appears
to
have
been
the
only
medium
for
transmitting
the
language
which
the
scribes
possessed
they
were
always
provided
with
slabs
of
a
fine
plastic
clay
carefully
mixed
and
kept
sufficiently
moist
to
take
easily
the
impression
of
an
object
but
at
the
same
time
sufficiently
firm
to
prevent
the
marks
once
made
from
becoming
either
blurred
or
effaced
when
a
scribe
had
a
text
to
copy
or
a
document
to
draw
up
he
chose
out
one
of
his
slabs
which
he
placed
flat
upon
his
left
palm
and
taking
in
the
right
hand
a
triangular
stylus
of
flint
copper
bronze
or
bone
he
at
once
set
to
work
the
instrument
in
early
times
terminated
in
a
fine
point
and
the
marks
made
by
it
when
it
was
gently
pressed
upon
the
clay
were
slender
and
of
uniform
thickness
in
later
times
the
extremity
of
the
stylus
was
cut
with
a
bevel
and
the
impression
then
took
the
shape
of
a
metal
nail
or
a
wedge
on
the
assyrian
monuments
we
frequently
see
scribes
taking
a
list
of
the
spoil
or
writing
letters
on
tablets
and
some
other
soft
material
either
papyrus
or
prepared
skin
sayce
has
given
good
reasons
for
believing
that
the
chaldaeanns
of
the
early
dynasties
knew
of
the
papyrus
and
either
made
it
themselves
or
had
it
brought
from
egypt

from

covered
both
sides
of
it
with
closely
written
lines
which
sometimes
ran
over
on
to
the
edges
when
the
writing
was
finished
the
scribe
sent
his
work
to
the
potter
who
put
it
in
the
kiln
and
baked
it
or
the
writer
may
have
had
a
small
oven
at
his
own
disposition
as
a
clerk
with
us
would
have
his
table
or
desk
the
shape
of
these
documents
varied
and
sometimes
strikes
us
as
being
peculiar
besides
the
tablets
and
the
bricks
we
find
small
solid
cones
or
hollow
cylinders
of
considerable
size
on
which
the
kings
related
their
exploits
or
recorded
the
history
of
their
wars
or
the
dedication
of
their
buildings
this
method
had
a
few
inconveniences
but
many
advantages
these
clay
books
were
heavy
to
hold
and
clumsy
to
handle
while
the
characters
did
not
stand
out
well
from
the
brown
yellow
and
whitish
background
of
the
material
but
on
the
other
hand
a
poem
baked
and
incorporated
into
the
page
itself
ran
less
danger
of
destruction
than
if
scribbled
in
ink
on
sheets
of
papyrus

make
no
impression

could
withstand

for
a
considerable
length

even
if
broken
the
pieces
were
still
of
use
as
long
as
it
was
not
pulverized
the
entire
document
could
be
restored
with
the
exception
perhaps
of
a
few
signs
or
scraps
of
a
sentence
the
inscriptions
which
have
been
saved
from
the
foundations
of
the
most
ancient
temples
several
of
which
date
back
forty
or
fifty
centuries
are
for
the
most
part
as
clear
and
legible
as
when
they
left
the
hands
of
the
writer
who
engraved
them
or
of
the
workmen
who
baked
them
it
is
owing
to
the
material
to
which
they
were
committed
that
we
possess
the
principal
works
of
chaldaean
literature
which
have
come
down
to
us
poems
annals
hymns
magical
incantations
how
few
fragments
of
these
would
ever
have
reached
us
had
their
authors
confided
them
to
parchment
or
paper
after
the
manner
of
the
egyptian
scribes
the
greatest
danger
that
they
ran
was
that
of
being
left
forgotten
in
the
corner
of
the
chamber
in
which
they
had
been
kept
or
buried
under
the
rubbish
of
a

a
fire

some
violent
catastrophe

then

the
means
of
preserving
them
by
falling
over
them

covering
them
up

under
the
ruins

would
lie
there
for
centuries
till
the
fortunate
explorer
should
bring
them
to
light
and
deliver
them
over

the
patient
study
of
the
learned
the
cuneiform
character
in
itself
is
neither
picturesque
nor
decorative
it
does
not
offer

delightful
assemblage
of
birds

of
men
and
quadrupeds
of
heads
and
limbs
of
tools
weapons
stars
trees
and
boats
which
succeed
each
other

perplexing
order
on
the
egyptian
monuments

give
permanence
to
the
glory
of
pharaoh
and
the
greatness
of
his
gods
cuneiform
writing
is
essentially
composed
of
thin
short
lines
placed
in
juxtaposition
or
crossing
each
other
in
a
somewhat
clumsy
fashion
it
has
the
appearance
of
numbers
of
nails
scattered
about
at
haphazard
and
its
angular
configuration
and
its
stiff
and
spiny
appearance
gives
the
inscriptions
a
dull
and
forbidding
aspect
which
no
artifice
of
the
engraver
can
overcome

yet
in
spite
of
their
seemingly
arbitrary
character
this
mass
of
strokes
had
its
source
in
actual
hieroglyphs
as
in
the
origin
of
the
egyptian
script
the
earliest
writers
had
begun
by
drawing
on
stone
or
clay
the
outline
of
the
object
of
which
they
desired
to
convey
the
idea
but
whereas
in
egypt
the
artistic
temperament
of
the
race
and
the
increasing
skill
of
their
sculptors
had
by
degrees
brought
the
drawing
of
each
sign
to
such
perfection
that
it
became
a
miniature
portrait
of
the
being
or
object
to
be
reproduced
in
chaldaea
on
the
contrary
the
signs
became
degraded
from
their
original
forms
on
account
of
the
difficulty
experienced
in
copying
them
with
the
stylus
on
the
clay
tablets
they
lost
their
original
vertical
position
and
were
placed
horizontally
retaining
finally
but
the
very
faintest
resemblance
to
the
original
model
for
instance
the
chaldaean
conception
of
the
sky
was
that
of
a
vault
divided
into
eight
segments
by
diameters
running
from
the
four
cardinal
points
and
from
their
principal
subdivisions
symbol
the
external
circle
was
soon
omitted
the
transverse
lines
alone
remaining
symbol
which
again
was
simplified
into
a
kind
of
irregular
cross
symbol
the
figure
of
a
man
standing
indicated
by
the
lines
resembling
his
contour
was
placed
on
its
side
symbol
and
reduced
little
by
little
till
it
came
to
be
merely
a
series
of
lines
symbol
symbol
we
may
still
recognize
in
symbol
the
five
fingers
and
palm
of
a
human
hand
symbol
but
who
would
guess
at
the
first
glance
that
symbol
stands
for
the
foot
which
the
scribes
strove
to
place
beside
each
character
the
special
hieroglyph
from
which
it
had
been
derived
several
fragments
of
these
still
exist
a
study
of
which
seems
to
show
that
the
assyrian
scribes
of
a
more
recent
period
were
at
times
as
much
puzzled
as
we
are
ourselves
when
they
strove
to
get
at
the
principles
of
their
own
script
they
had
come
to
look
on
it
as
nothing
more
than
a
system
of
arbitrary
combinations
whose
original
form
had
passed
all
the
more
readily
into
oblivion
because
it
had
been
borrowed
from
a
foreign
race
who
as
far
as
they
were
concerned
had
ceased
to
have
a
separate
existence
the
script
had
been
invented
by
the
sumerians
in
the
very
earliest
times
and
even
they
may
have
brought
it
in
an
elemental
condition
from
their
distant
fatherland
the
first
articulate
sounds
which
being
attached
to
the
hieroglyphs
gave
to
each
an
unalterable
pronunciation
were
words
in
the
sumerian
tongue
subsequently
when
the
natural
progress
of
human
thought
led
thi
chaldaeans
to
replace
as
in
egypt
the
majority
of
the
signs
representing
ideas
by
those
representing
sounds
the
syllabic
values
which
were
developed
side
by
side
with
the
ideographic
values

sumerian
the
group
symbol
throughout
all
its
forms
designates
in
the
first
place
the
sky

the
god
of
the
sky
and
finally
the
concept
of
divinity
in
general
in
its
first
two
senses
it
is
read
ana
but
in
the
last
it
becomes
dingir
dimir
and
though
it
never
lost
its
double
force
it
was
soon
separated
from
the
ideas
which
it
evoked
to
be
used
merely
to
denote
the
syllable
an
wherever
it
occurred
even
in
cases
where
it
had
no
connection
with
the
sky
or
heavenly
things
the
same
process
was
applied
to
other
signs
with
similar
results
after
having
merely
denoted
ideas
they
came
to
stand
for
the
sounds
corresponding
to
them
and
then
passed
on
to
be
mere
syllables
complex
syllables
in
which
several
consonants
may
be
distinguished
or
simple
syllables
composed
of
only
one
consonant
and
one
vowel
or
vice
versa
the
egyptians
had
carried
this
system
still
further
and
in
many
cases
had
kept
only
one
part
of
the
syllable
namely
a
mute
consonant
they
detached
for
example
the
final
u
from
pu
and
bu
and
gave
only
the
values
b
and
p

the
human

it
was
eminently
wanting
in
simplicity
but
taken
as
a
whole
it
would
not
have
presented
as
many
difficulties
as
the
script
of
the
egyptians
had
it
not
been
forced
at
a
very
early
period
to
adapt
itself
to
the
exigencies
of
a
language
for
which
it
had
not
been
made
when
it
came
to
be
appropriated
by
the
semites
the
ideographs
which
up
till
then
had
been
read
in
sumerian
did
not
lose
the
sounds
which
they
possessed
in
that
tongue
but
borrowed
others
from
the
new
language

called

called
shami

the
context

sense

shami
when
the

evidently
meant

added
these
two
vocables
to
the
preceding
ana
an
dingir

but
they
did
not
stop
there
they
confounded
the
picture
of
the
star
symbol
with
that
of
the
sky
and
sometimes
attributed
to
symbol
the
pronunciation
kakkabu
and
the
meaning
of
star
the
same
process
was
applied
to
all
the
groups
and
the
semitic
values
being
added
to
the
sumerian
the
scribes
soon
found
themselves
in
possession
of
a
double
set
of
syllables
both
simple
and
compound
this
multiplicity
of
sounds
this
polyphonous
character
attached
to

a

determined
the

it
was
to
be
read

which
like
the

not

in
this

they
succeeded
in

it

and
so
on
in
spite
of
these
restrictions
and
explanations
the
obscurity
of
the
meaning
was
so
great
that
in
many
cases
the
scribes
ran
the
risk
of
being
unable
to
make
out
certain
words
and
understand
certain
passages
many
of
the
values
occurred
but
rarely
and
remained
unknown
to
those
who
did
not
take
the
trouble
to
make
a
careful
study
of
the
syllabary
and
its
history
it
became
necessary
to
draw
up
tables
for
their
use
in
which
all
the
signs
were
classified
and
arranged
with
their
meanings
and
phonetic
transcriptions
these
signs
occupied
one
column

in
three

four
corresponding
columns
would
be
found

the

secondly
the

of

which
the

expressed

the
sumerian

assyrian
words
which
they
served
to
render
and
sometimes
glosses
which
completed
the
explanation

even
this
is
far
from
exhausting
the
matter
several
of
these
dictionaries
went
back
to
a
very
early
date
and
tradition
ascribes
to
sargon
of
agade
the
merit
of
having
them
drawn
up
or
of
having
collected
them
in
his
palace
the
number
of
them
naturally
increased
in
the
course
of
centuries
in
the
later
times
of
the
assyrian
empire
they
were
so
numerous
as
to
form
nearly
of
the
works
in
the
library
at
nineveh

have
done
and
which
must
have
saved
them
from
many
a
blunder
when
once
accustomed
to
the
difficulties
and
intricacies
of
their
calling
the
scribes
were
never
at
a
standstill
the
stylus
was
plied
in
chaldaea
no
less
assiduously
than
was
the
calamus
in
egypt
and
the
indestructible
clay
which
the
chaldaeans
were
as
a
rule
content
to
use
proved
a
better
medium
in
the
long
run
than
the
more
refined
material
employed
by
their
rivals
the
baked
or
merely
dried
clay
tablets
have
withstood
the
assaults
of
time
in
surprising
quantities
while
the
majority
of
papyri
have
disappeared
without
leaving
a
trace
behind
if
at
babylon
we
rarely
meet
with
those
representations
which
we
find
everywhere
in
the
tombs
of
saqqara
or
gizeh
of
the
people
themselves
and
their
families
their
occupations
amusements
and
daily
intercourse
we
possess
on
the
other
hand
that
of
which
the
ruins
of
memphis
have
furnished
us
but
scanty
instances
up
to
the
present
time
namely
judicial
documents
regulating
the
mutual
relations
of
the
people
and
conferring
a
legal
sanction
on
the
various
events
of
their
life
whether
it
were
a
question
of
buying
lands
or
contracting
a
marriage
of
a
loan
on
interest
or
the
sale
of
slaves
the
scribe
was
called
in
with
his
soft
tablets
to
engross
the
necessary
agreement
in
this
he
would
insert
as
many
details
as
possible
the
day
of
the
month
the
year
of
the
reigning
sovereign
and
at
times
to
be
still
more
precise
an
allusion
to
some
important
event
which
had
just
taken
place
and
a
memorial
of
which
was
inserted
in
official
annals
such
as
the
taking
of
a
town
the
defeat
of
a
neighbouring
king
the
dedication
of
a
temple
the
building
of
a
wall
or
fortress
the
opening
of
a
canal
or
the
ravages
of
an
inundation
the
names
of
the
witnesses
and
magistrates
before
whom
the
act
was
confirmed
were
also
added
to
those
of
the
contracting
parties
the
method
of
sanctioning
it
was
curious
an
indentation
was
made
with
the
on
one
of
the
sides
of
the
tablet
and
this
mark
followed
or
preceded
by
the
mention
of
a
name
of
zabudamik
of
abzii
took
the
place
of
our
more
or
less
complicated
in
later
times
only
the
buyer
and
witnesses
approved
by
a
while
the
seller
appended
his
seal
an
inscription
incised
above
the
impress
indicating
the
position
of
the
signatory
every
one
of
any
importance
possessed
a
seal
which
he
wore
attached
to
his
wrist
or
hung
round
his
neck
by
a
cord
he
scarcely
ever
allowed
it
to
be
separated
from
his
person
during
his
lifetime
and
after
death
it
was
placed
with
him
in
the
tomb
in
order
to
prevent
any
improper
use
being
made
of
it
it
was
usually
a
cylinder
sometimes
a
truncated
cone
with
a
convex
base
either
of
marble
red
or
green
jasper
agate
cornelian
onyx
or
rock

but
rarely
of

engraved

was
an
emblem
or
subject
chosen
by
the
owner
such
as
the
single
figure
of
a
god
or
goddess
an
act
of
adoration
a
sacrifice
or
an
episode
in
the
story
of
gilgames
followed
sometimes
by
the
inscription
of
a
name
and
title
the
cylinder
was
rolled
or
in
the
case
of
the
cone
merely
pressed
on
the
clay
in
the
space
reserved
for
it
in
several
localities
the
contracting
parties
had
recourse
to
a
very
ingenious
procedure
to
prevent
the
agreements
being
altered
or
added
to
by
unscrupulous
persons
when
the
document
had
been
impressed
on
the
tablet
it
was
enveloped
in
a
second
coating
of
clay
upon
which
an
exact
copy
of
the
original
was
made
the
latter
thus
becoming
inaccessible
to
forgers
if
by
chance
in
course
of
time
any
disagreement
should
take
place
and
an
alteration
of
the
visible
text
should
be
suspected
the
outer
envelope
was
broken
in
the
presence
of
witnesses
and
a
comparison
was
made
to
see
if
the
exterior
corresponded
exactly
with
the
interior
version
families
thus
had
their
private
archives
to
which
additions
were
rapidly
made
by
every
generation
every
household
thus
accumulated
not
only
the
evidences
of
its
own
history
but
to
some
extent
that
of
other
families
with
whom
they
had
formed
alliances
or
had
business
or
friendly
relations
the
tablets
of
come
from
one
of
these
family
collections
they
all
in
number
about
one
hundred
rested
on
three
enormous
bricks
and
they
had
been
covered
with
a
mat
of
which
the
remains
were
still
visible
three
other
crude
bricks
covered
the
heap
the
documents
contained
in
them
relate
for
the
most
part
to
the
families
of
sininana
and
amililani

of

sketch
by

the
constitution
of
the
family
was
of
a
complex
character
it
would
appear
that
the
people
of
each
city
were
divided
into
clans
all
of
whose
members
claimed
to
be
descended
from
a
common
ancestor
who
had
flourished
at
a
more
or
less
remote
period
the
members
of
each
clan
were
by
no
means
all
in
the
same
social
position
some
having
gone
down
in
the
world
others
having
raised
themselves
and
amongst
them
we
find
many
different
callings
from
agricultural
labourers
to
scribes
and
from
merchants
to
artisans
no
mutual
tie
existed
among
the
majority
of
these
members
except
the
remembrance
of
their
common
origin
perhaps
also
a
common
religion
and
eventual
rights
of
succession
or
claims
upon
what
belonged
to
each
one
individually
the
branches
which
had
become
gradually
separated
from
the
parent
stock
and
which
taken
all
together
formed
the
clan
possessed
each
on
the
contrary
a
very
strict
organization
it
is
possible
that
at
the
outset
the
woman
occupied
the
more
important
position
but
at
an
early
date
the
man
became
the
head
of
the
family
and
around
him
were
ranged
the
wives
children
servants
and
slaves
all
of
whom
had
their
various
duties
and
privileges
the
change
in
the
condition
of
women
would
be
due
to
the
influence
of
semitic
ideas
and
customs
in
chaldaea
he
offered
the
household
worship
to
the
gods
of
his
race
in
accordance
with
special
rites
which
had
come
down
to
him
from
his
father
he
made
at
the
tombs
of
his
ancestors
at
such
times
as
were
customary
the
offerings
and
prayers
which
assured
their
repose
in
the
other
world
and
his
powers
were
as
extensive
in
civil
as
in
religious
matters
he
had
absolute
authority
over
all
the
members
of
his
household
and
anything
undertaken
by
them
without
his
consent
was
held
invalid
in
the
eyes
of
the
law
his
sons
could
not
marry
unless
he
had
duly
authorized
them
to
do
so
for
this
purpose
he
appeared
before
the
magistrate
with
the
future
couple
and
the
projected
union
could
not
be
held
as
an
actual
marriage
until
he
had
affixed
his
seal
or
made
his
on
the
contract
tablet
it
amounted
in
fact
to
a
formal
deed
of
sale
and
the
parents
of
the
girl
parted
with
her
only
in
exchange
for
a
proportionate
gift
from
the
bridegroom
one
girl
would
be
valued
at
a
silver
shekel
by
weight
while
another
was
worth
a
mina
another
much
less
the
handing
over
of
the
price
was
accompanied
with
a
certain
solemnity
when
the
young
man
possessed
no
property
as
yet
of
his
own
his
family
advanced
him
the
sum
needed
for
the
purchase

the
time

provided
her
with
a
dowry
suited
to
her
social
position
which
was
often
augmented
by
considerable
presents
from
her
grandmother
aunts
and
cousins
shamashnazir
receives
as
the
price
of
his
daughter
ten
shekels
of
silver
which
appears
to
have
been
an
average
price
in
the
class
of
life
to
which
he
belonged
the
nature
of
the
dowry
in
ancient
times
is
clear
from
the
tablets
in
which
the
old
legal
texts
are
explained
and
again
from
the
contents
of
the
contracts
of
and
the
documents
on
stone
such
as
the
micliaux
stone
in
which
we
see
women
bringing
their
possessions
into
the
community
by
marriage
and
yet
retaining
the
entire
disposition
of
them
the
dowry
would
consist
of
a
carefully
marked
out
field
of
corn
a
grove
of
a
house
in
the
town
a
trousseau
furniture
slaves
or
ready
money
the
whole
would
be
committed
to
clay
of
which
there
would
be
three
copies
at
least
two
being
given
by
the
scribe
to
the
contracting
parties
while
the
third
would
be
deposited
in
the
hands
of
the
magistrate
when
the
bride
and
bridegroom
both
belonged
to
the
same
class
or
were
possessed
of
equal
fortunes
the
relatives
of
the
woman
could
exact
an
oath
from
the
man
that
he
would
abstain
from
taking
a
second
wife
during
her
lifetime
a
special
article
of
the
marriage
agreement
permitted
the
woman
to
go
free
should
the
husband
break
his
faith
and
bound
him
to
pay
an
indemnity
as
a
compensation
for
the
insult
he
had
offered
her
this
engagement
on
the
part
of
the
man
however
did
not
affect
his
relations
with
his
female
servants
in
chaldaea
as
in
egypt
and
indeed
in
the
whole
of
the
ancient
world
they
were
always
completely
at
the
mercy
of
their
purchaser
and
the
permission
to
treat
them
as
he
would
had
become
so
much
of
a
custom
that
the
begetting
of
children
by
their
master
was
desired
rather
than
otherwise
the
complaints
of
the
despised
slave
who
had
not
been
taken
into
her
favour
formed
one
of
the
themes
of
popular
poetry
at
a
very
early
period
when
the
contract
tablet
was
finally
sealed
one
of
the
witnesses
who
was
required
to
be
a
free
man
joined
the
hands
of
the
young
couple
nothing
then
remained
to
be
done
but
to
invite
the
blessing
of
the
gods
and
to
end
the
day
by
a
feast
which
would
unite
both
families
and
their
guests
the
evil
spirits
however
always
in
quest
of
an
easy
prey
were
liable
to
find
their
way
into
the
nuptial
chamber
favoured
by
the
confusion
inseparable
from
all
household
rejoicing
prudence
demanded
that
their
attempts
should
be
frustrated
and
that
the
newly
married
couple
should
be
protected
from
their
attacks
the
companions
of
the
bridegroom
took
possession
of
him
and
hand
to
hand
and
foot
to
foot
formed
as
it
were
a
rampart
round
him
with
their
bodies
and
carried
him
off
solemnly
to
his
expectant
bride
he
then
again
repeated
the
words
which
he
had
said
in
the
morning
am
the
son
of
a
prince
gold
and
silver
shall
fill
thy
bosom
thou
even
thou
shalt
be
my
wife
i
myself
will
be
thy
husband
and
he
continued
the
fruits
borne
by
an
orchard
so
great
shall
be
the
abundance
which
i
shall
pour
out
upon
this
the
priest
then
called
down
upon
him
benedictions
from
on
high
o
ye
gods
all
that
is
bad
and
that
is
not
good
in
this
man
drive
it
far
from
him
and
give
him
strength
as
for
thee
o
man
exhibit
thy
manhood
that
this
woman
may
be
thy
wife
thou
o
woman
give
that
which
makes
thy
womanhood
that
this
man
may
be
thy
on
the
following
morning
a
thanksgiving
sacrifice
celebrated
the
completion
of
the
marriage
and
by
purifying
the
new
household
drove
from
it
the
host
of
evil
spirits
this
part
of
the
ceremony
is
described
on
a
assyrian
tablet
of
which
two
copies
exist
discovered
and
translated
by
pinches
the
interpretation
appears
to
me
to
result
from
the
fact
that
mention
is
made
at
the
commencement
of
the
column
of
impious
beings
without
gods
who
might
approach
the
man
in
other
places
magical
exorcisms
indicate
how
much
those
spirits
were
dreaded
deprived
the
bride
of
the
embraces
of
the
as
pinches
remarks
the
formula
is
also
found
in
the
part
of
the
poem
of
gilgames
where
ishtar
wishes
to
marry
the
hero
which
shows
that
the
rite
and
its
accompanying
words
belong
to
a
remote
past
the
text
that
describes
these
ceremonies
was
discovered
and
published
by
pinches
as
far
as
i
can
judge
it
contained
an
exorcism
against
the
of
the
tag
and
the
mention
of
this
subject
called
up
that
of
the
marriage
rites
the
ceremony
commanded
on
the
day
following
the
marriage
was
probably
a
purification
as
late
as
the
time
of
herodotus
the
union
of
man
and
woman
rendered
both
impure
and
they
had
to
perform
an
ablution
before
recommencing
their
occupations
the
woman
once
bound
could
only
escape
from
the
sovereign
power
of
her
husband
by
death
or
divorce
but
divorce
for
her
was
rather
a
trial
to
which
she
submitted
than
a
right
of
which
she
could
freely
make
use
her
husband
could
repudiate
her
at
will
without
any
complicated
ceremonies
it
was
enough
for
him
to
say
art
not
my
wife
and
to
restore
to
her
a
sum
of
money
equalling
in
value
the
dowry
he
had
received
with
her
he
then
sent
her
back
to
her
father
with
a
letter
informing
him
of
the
dissolution
of
the
conjugal
tie
but
if
in
a
moment
of
weariness
or
anger
she
hurled
the
fatal
formula
at
him
are
not
my
husband
her
fate
was
sealed
she
was
thrown
into
the
river
and
drowned
the
sum
is
fixed
at
half
a
mina
by
the
text
of
the
sumerian
laws
but
it
was
sometimes
less
ten
shekels
and
sometimes
more
a
whole
mina
repudiation
of
a
wife
and
the
ceremonial
connected
with
it
are
summarized
as
far
as
ancient
times
are
concerned
by
a
passage
in
the
tablet
published
by
rawlinson
and
translated
by
bertin
on
the
contrary
takes
the
same
text
to
be
a
description
of
the
principal
and
from
it
he
draws
the
conclusion
that
the
possibility
of
divorce
was
not
admitted
in
chaldaea
between
persons
of
noble
family
meissner
very
rightly
returns
to
interpretation
a
few
details
in
which
he
corrects
this
fact
was
evident
from
the
text
of
the
laws
concerning
the
organization
of
the
according
to
the
generally
received
interpretation
according
to
that
proposed
by
it
was
the
woman
who
had
the
right
of
causing
the
husband
who
had
wronged
her
to
be
thrown
into
the
river
the
publication
of
the
contracts
of
iltani
and
of
bashtum
appear
to
have
shown
conclusively
the
correctness
of
the
ordinary
translation
uncertainty
with
regard
to
one
word
prevents
us
from
knowing
whether
the
guilty
wife
were
strangled
before
being
thrown
into
the
water
or
if
she
were
committed
to
the
river
alive
the
adulteress
was
also
punished
with
death
but
with
death
by
the
sword
and
when
the
use
of
iron
became
widespread
the
blade
was
to
be
of
that
metal
another
ancient
custom
only
spared
the
criminal
to
devote
her
to
a
life
of
infamy
the
outraged
husband
stripped
her
of
her
fleecy
garments
giving
her
merely
the
in
its
place
which
left
her
half
naked
and
then
out
of
the
house
into
the
street
where
she
was
at
the
mercy
of
the
first
women
of
noble
or
wealthy
families
found
in
their
fortune
a
certain
protection
from
the
abuse
of
marital
authority
the
property
which
they
brought
with
them
by
their
marriage
contract
remained
at
their
own
disposal
they
had
the
entire
management
of
it
they
farmed
it
out
they
sold
it
they
spent
the
income
from
it
as
they
liked
without
interference
from
any
one
the
man
enjoyed
the
comforts
which
it
procured
but
he
could
not
touch
it
and
his
hold
upon
it
was
so
slight
that
his
creditors
could
not
lay
their
hands
on
it
in
the
documents
of
the
new
chaldaean
empire
we
find
instances
of
married
women
selling
their
property
themselves
and
even
of
their
being
present
seated
at
the
conclusion
of
the
sale
or
of
their
ceding
to
a
married
daughter
some
property
in
their
own
possession
thus
renouncing
the
power
of
disposing
of
it
and
keeping
merely
the
income
from
it
we
have
also
instances
of
women
reclaiming
valuables
of
gold
which
their
husbands
had
given
away
without
their
authorisation
and
also
obtaining
an
indemnity
for
the
wrong
they
had
suffered
also
of
their
lending
money
to
the
of
their
brother
in
fine
empowered
to
deal
with
their
own
property
in
every
respect
like
an
ordinary
proprietor
if
by
his
own
act
he
divorced
his
wife
he
not
only
lost
all
benefit
from
her
property
but
he
was
obliged
to
make
her
an
allowance
or
to
pay
her
an
indemnity
at
his
death
the
widow
succeeded
to
these
without
prejudice
to
what
she
was
entitled
to
by
her
marriage
contract
or
the
will
of
the
deceased
the
woman
with
a
dowry
therefore
became
more
or
less
emancipated
by
virtue
of
her
money
as
her
departure
deprived
the
household
of
as
much
as
and
sometimes
more
than
she
had
brought
into
it
every
care
was
taken
that
she
should
have
no
cause
to
retire
from
it
and
that
no
pretext
should
be
given
to
her
parents
for
her
recall
to
her
old
home
her
wealth
thus
obtained
for
her
the
consideration
and
fair
treatment
which
the
law
had
at
the
outset
denied
to
her
the
restitution
of
the
dowry
after
divorce
is
ascertained
as
far
as
later
times
are
concerned
from
documents
similar
to
that
published
by
in
which
we
see
the
second
husband
of
a
divorced
wife
claiming
the
dowry
from
the
first
husband
the
indemnity
was
fixed
beforehand
at
six
silver
minae
in
the
marriage
contract
published
by
oppert
when
however
the
wife
was
poor
she
had
to
bear
without
complaint
the
whole
burden
of
her
inferior
position
her
parents
had
no
other
resource
than
to
ask
the
highest
possible
price
for
her
according
to
the
rank
in
which
they
lived
or
in
virtue
of
the
personal
qualities
she
was
supposed
to
possess
and
this
amount
paid
into
their
hands
when
they
delivered
her
over
to
the
husband
formed
if
not
an
actual
dowry
for
her
at
least
a
provision
for
her
in
case
of
repudiation
or
widowhood
she
was
not
however
any
less
the
slave
of
her
husband
a
privileged
slave
it
is
true
and
one
whom
he
could
not
sell
like
his
other
slaves
but
of
whom
he
could
easily
rid
himself
when
her
first
youth
was
passed
or
when
she
ceased
to
please
him
it
appears
however
in
certain
cases
not
clearly
specified
that
the
husband
could
sell
his
wife
if
she
were
a
shrew
as
a
slave
this
form
of
marriage
which
was
of
frequent
occurrence
in
ancient
times
fell
into
disuse
among
the
upper
classes
at
least
of
babylonian
society
a
few
examples
however
are
found
in
late
times
it
continued
in
use
among
the
lower
classes
and
herodotus
affirms
that
in
his
time
marriage
markets
were
held
regularly
as
in
our
own
time
fairs
are
held
for
hiring
male
and
female
servants
in
many
cases
the
fiction
of
purchase
was
set
aside
and
mutual
consent
took
the
place
of
all
other
formalities
marriage
then
becoming
merely
cohabitation
terminating
at
will
the
consent
of
the
father
was
not
required
for
this
irregular
union
and
many
a
son
contracted
a
marriage
after
this
fashion
unknown
to
his
relatives
with
some
young
girl
either
in
his
own
or
in
an
inferior
station
but
the
law
refused
to
allow
her
any
title
except
that
of
concubine
and
forced
her
to
wear
a
distinctive
mark
perhaps
that
of
servitude
namely
the
representation
of
an
olive
in
some
valuable
stone
or
in
bearing
her
own
and
her
name
with
the
date
of
their
union
which
she
kept
hung
round
her
neck
by
a
cord
whether
they
were
legitimate
wives
or
not
the
women
of
the
lower
and
middle
classes
enjoyed
as
much
independence
as
did
the
egyptian
women
of
a
similar
rank
as
all
the
household
cares
fell
to
their
share
it
was
necessary
that
they
should
be
free
to
go
about
at
all
hours
of
the
day
and
they
could
be
seen
in
the
streets
and
the
markets
with
bare
feet
their
head
and
face
uncovered
wearing
their
linen
or
their
long
draped
garments
of
hairy
texture
their
whole
life
was
expended
in
a
ceaseless
toil
for
their
husbands
and
children
night
and
morning
they
went
to
fetch
water
from
the
public
well
or
the
river
they
bruised
the
corn
made
the
bread
spun
wove
and
clothed
the
entire
household
in
spite
of
the
frequent
demands
of
maternity
the
chaldaean
women
of
wealth
or
noble
birth
whose
civil
status
gave
them
a
higher
position
did
not
enjoy
so
much
freedom
they
were
scarcely
affected
by
the
cares
of
daily
life
and
if
they
did
any
work
within
their
houses
it
was
more
from
a
natural
instinct
a
sense
of
duty
or
to
relieve
the
tedium
of
their
existence
than
from
constraint
or
necessity
but
the
exigencies
of
their
rank
reduced
them
to
the
state
of
prisoners
all
the
luxuries
and
comforts
which
money
could
procure
were
lavished
on
them
or
they
obtained
them
for
themselves
but
all
the
while
they
were
obliged
to
remain
shut
in
the
harem
within
their
own
houses
when
they
went
out
it
was
only
to
visit
their
female
friends
or
their
relatives
to
go
to
some
temple
or
festival
and
on
such
occasions
they
were
surrounded
with
servants
eunuchs
and
pages
whose
serried
ranks
shut
out
the
external
world
for
the
long
garment
of
the
women
see
the
statue
represented
on
of
the
present
work
for
the
cloth
which
left
the
shoulders
and
bust
exposed
see
the
bronze
figure
on
the
latter
was
no
doubt
the
garment
worn
at
home
by
respectable
women
we
see
by
the
punishment
inflicted
on
adulteresses
that
it
was
an
outdoor
garment
for
courtesans
and
also
doubtless
for
slaves
and
women
of
the
lower
classes
occupations
are
mentioned
in
several
texts
and
on
several
ancient
monuments
on
the
seal
an
impress
of
which
is
given
on
of
this
volume
we
see
above
on
the
left
a
woman
kneeling
and
crushing
the
corn
and
before
her
a
row
of
little
disks
representing
no
doubt
the
loaves
prepared
for
baking
the
length
of
time
for
suckling
a
child
is
fixed
at
three
years
by
the
tablet
relating
the
history
of
the
foundling
protracted
suckling
was
customary
also
in
egypt
there
was
no
lack
of
children
in
these
houses
when
the
man
had
several
mistresses
either
simultaneously
or
successively
maternity
was
before
all
things
a
first
duty
should
she
delay
in
bearing
children
or
should
anything
happen
to
them
she
was
considered
as
accursed
or
possessed
and
she
was
banished
from
the
family
lest
her
presence
should
be
a
source
of
danger
to
it
in
spite
of
this
many
households
remained
childless
either
because
a
clause
inserted
in
the
contract
prevented
the
dismissal
of
the
wife
if
barren
or
because
the
children
had
died
when
the
father
was
stricken
in
years
and
there
was
little
hope
of
further
offspring
in
such
places
adoption
filled
the
gaps
left
by
nature
and
furnished
the
family
with
desired
heirs
for
this
purpose
some
chance
orphan
might
be
brought
into
the
household
one
of
those
poor
little
creatures
consigned
by
their
mothers
to
the
river
as
in
the
case
of
shargani
according
to
the
ancient
legend
or
who
had
been
exposed
at
the
to
excite
the
pity
of
like
the
foundling
whose
story
is
given
us
in
an
old
ballad
who
had
neither
father
nor
mother
he
who
knew
not
his
father
or
mother
but
whose
earliest
memory
is
of
a
well
whose
entry
into
the
world
was
in
the
street
his
benefactor
him
from
the
jaws
of
dogs
and
took
him
from
the
beaks
of
he
seized
the
seal
before
witnesses
and
he
marked
him
on
the
sole
of
the
foot
with
the
seal
of
the
witness
then
he
entrusted
him
to
a
nurse
and
for
three
years
he
provided
the
nurse
with
flour
oil
and
when
the
weaning
was
accomplished
appointed
him
to
be
his
child
he
brought
him
up
to
be
his
child
he
inscribed
him
as
his
child
and
he
gave
him
the
education
of
a
the
rites
of
adoption
in
these
cases
did
not
differ
from
those
attendant
upon
birth
on
both
occasions
the
newly
born
infant
was
shown
to
witnesses
and
it
was
marked
on
the
soles
of
its
feet
to
establish
its
identity
its
registration
in
the
family
archives
did
not
take
place
until
these
precautions
had
been
observed
and
children
adopted
in
this
manner
were
regarded
thenceforward
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
as
the
legitimate
heirs
of
the
family
divorce
for
sterility
was
customary
in
very
early
times
complete
sterility
or
miscarriage
was
thought
to
be
occasioned
by
evil
spirits
a
woman
thus
possessed
with
a
devil
came
to
be
looked
on
as
a
dangerous
being
whom
it
was
necessary
to
exorcise
many
of
these
children
were
those
of
courtesans
or
women
who
had
been
repudiated
as
we
learn
from
the
assyrian
tablet
of
rawlinson
will
expose
her
child
alone
in
the
street
where
the
serpents
in
the
road
may
bite
it
and
its
father
and
mother
will
know
it
no
people
desiring
to
adopt
a
child
usually
made
inquiries
among
their
acquaintances
or
poor
friends
or
cousins
who
might
consent
to
give
up
one
of
their
sons
in
the
hope
of
securing
a
better
future
for
him
when
he
happened
to
be
a
minor
the
real
father
and
mother
or
in
the
case
of
the
death
of
one
the
surviving
parent
appeared
before
the
scribe
and
relinquished
all
their
rights
in
favour
of
the
adopting
parents
the
latter
in
accepting
this
act
of
renunciation
promised
henceforth
to
treat
the
child
as
if
he
were
of
their
own
flesh
and
blood
and
often
settled
upon
him
at
the
same
time
a
certain
sum
chargeable
on
their
own
patrimony
when
the
adopted
son
was
of
age
his
consent
to
the
agreement
was
required
in
addition
to
that
of
his
parents
the
adoption
was
sometimes
prompted
by
an
interested
motive
and
not
merely
by
the
desire
for
posterity
or
its
semblance
labour
was
expensive
slaves
were
scarce
and
children
by
working
for
their
father
took
the
place
of
hired
servants
and
were
content
like
them
with
food
and
clothing
the
adoption
of
adults
was
therefore
most
frequent
in
ancient
times
the
introduction
of
a
person
into
a
fresh
household
severed
the
ties
which
bound
him
to
the
old
one
he
became
a
stranger
to
those
who
had
borne
him
he
had
no
filial
obligations
to
discharge
to
them
nor
had
he
any
right
to
whatever
property
they
might
possess
unless
indeed
any
unforeseen
circumstance
prevented
the
carrying
out
of
the
agreement
and
legally
obliged
him
to
return
to
the
status
of
his
birth
in
return
he
undertook
all
the
duties
and
enjoyed
the
privileges
of
his
new
position
he
owed
to
his
adopted
parents
the
same
amount
of
work
obedience
and
respect
that
he
would
have
given
to
his
natural
parents
he
shared
in
their
condition
whether
for
good
or
ill
and
he
inherited
their
possessions
provision
was
made
for
him
in
case
of
his
repudiation
by
those
who
had
adopted
him
and
they
had
to
make
him
compensation
he
received
the
portion
which
would
have
accrued
to
him
after
their
death
and
he
then
left
them
families
appear
to
have
been
fairly
united
in
spite
of
the
elasticity
of
the
laws
which
governed
them
and
of
the
divers
elements
of
which
they
were
sometimes
composed
no
doubt
polygamy
and
frequently
divorce
exercised
here
as
elsewhere
a
deleterious
influence
the
harems
of
babylon
were
constantly
the
scenes
of
endless
intrigues
and
quarrels
among
the
women
and
children
of
varied
condition
and
different
parentage
who
filled
them
among
the
people
of
the
middle
classes
where
restricted
means
necessarily
prevented
a
man
having
many
wives
the
course
of
family
life
appears
to
have
been
as
calm
and
affectionate
as
in
egypt
under
the
unquestioned
supremacy
of
the
father
and
in
the
event
of
his
early
death
the
widow
and
later
the
son
or
took
the
direction
of
affairs
should
quarrels
arise
and
reach
the
point
of
bringing
about
a
complete
rupture
between
parents
and
children
the
law
intervened
not
to
reconcile
them
but
to
repress
any
violence
of
which
either
side
might
be
guilty
towards
the
other
it
was
reckoned
as
a
misdemeanour
for
any
father
or
mother
to
disown
a
child
and
they
were
punished
by
being
kept
shut
up
in
their
own
house
as
long
doubtless
as
they
persisted
in
disowning
it
but
it
was
a
crime
in
a
son
even
if
he
were
an
adopted
son
to
renounce
his
parents
and
he
was
punished
severely
if
he
had
said
to
his
father
art
not
my
father
the
latter
marked
him
with
a
conspicuous
sign
and
sold
him
in
the
market
if
he
had
said
to
his
mother
for
thee
thou
art
not
my
mother
he
was
similarly
branded
and
led
through
the
streets
or
along
the
roads
where
with
hue
and
cry
he
was
driven
from
the
town
and
province
i
have
adopted
the
generally
received
meaning
of
this
document
as
a
whole
but
i
am
obliged
to
state
that
menant
admit
quite
a
different
interpretation
according
to
them
it
would
appear
to
be
a
sweeping
renunciation
of
children
by
parents
and
of
parents
by
children
at
the
close
of
a
judicial
condemnation
oppert
has
upheld
this
interpretation
against
haupt
and
still
keeps
to
his
opinion
the
documents
published
by
meissner
show
that
the
text
of
the
ancient
sumerian
laws
applied
equally
to
adopted
children
but
made
no
distinction
between
the
insult
offered
to
the

it
was

among

a

they
were

they
were
continually
bringing

intermarried

brought
up

the

fashion
as
did
the
beasts
of
his

the

their
life

death
was
dependent
upon
his
will
though
the
exercise
of
his

was
naturally
restrained

them

they
ended
by
becoming
confidential
servants

they
had
accumulated

furnished
them
with

could

up

there

we

do

escape

they
climbed
up

many
families

they
constituted

the

made

preserve
intact
through
all
reverses
of
fortune
the
head
of
the

bequeathed

received
his

in

to
invest
this
act
with
greater
solemnity
it
took
place
usually
in
the
presence
of
a
priest
those
interested
repaired
to
the
temple
the
gate
of
the
god
they
placed
the
whole
of
the
inheritance
in
the
hands
of
the
chosen
arbitrator
and
demanded
of
him
to
divide
it
justly
or
the
eldest
brother
perhaps
anticipated
the
apportionment
and
the
priest
had
merely
to
sanction
the
result
or
settle
the
differences
which
might
arise
among
the
lawful
recipients
in
the
course
of
the
operation
when
this
was
accomplished
the
legatees
had
to
declare
themselves
satisfied
and
when
no
further
claims
arose
they
had
to
sign
an
engagement
before
the
priestly
arbitrator
that
they
would
henceforth
refrain
from
all
quarrelling
on
the
subject
and
that
they
would
never
make
a
complaint
one
against

dint
of
these
continual
redistributions
from
one
generation
to
another
the
largest
fortunes
soon
became
dispersed
the
individual
shares
became
smaller
and
smaller
and
scarcely
sufficed
to
keep
a
family
so
that
the
slightest
reverse
obliged
the
possessor
to
have
recourse
to
usurers
the
chaldaeans
like
the
egyptians
were
unacquainted
with
the
use
of
money
but
from
the
earliest
times
the
employment
of
precious
metals
for
purposes
of
exchange
was
practised
among
them
to
an
enormous
extent
though
copper
and
gold
were
both
used
silver
was
the
principal
medium
in
these
transactions
and
formed
the
standard
value
of
all
purchaseable
objects
it
was
never
cut
into
flat
rings
or
twists
of
wire
as
was
the
case
with
the
egyptian
it
was
melted
into
small
unstamped
ingots
which
were
passed
from
hand
to
hand
by
weight
being
tested
in
the
scales
at
each
transaction
was
in
the
ordinary
language
the
equivalent
for
in
metal
whereas
denoted
that
the
payment
was
in
grain
the
ingots
for
exchange
were
therefore
designated
by
the
name
of
the
weights
to
which
they
corresponded
the
lowest
unit
was
a
shekel
weighing
on
an
average
nearly
half
an
ounce
sixty
shekels
making
a
mina
and
sixty
minas
a
talent
it
is
a
question
whether
the
chaldaeanns
possessed
in
early
times
as
did
the
assyrians
of
a
later
period
two
kinds
of
shekels
and
minas
one
heavy
and
the
other
light
whether
the
loan
were
in
metal
grain
or
any
other
substance
the
interest
was
very
high
a
very
ancient
law
fixed
it
in
certain
cases
at
twelve
drachmas
per
mina
per
annum
that
is
to
say
at
twenty
per
and
more
recent
texts
show
us
that
when
raised
to
per
it
did
not
appear
to
them
abnormal
we
find
several
different
examples
during
the
second
chaldaeann
empire
of
an
exchange
of
corn
for
provisions
and
liquids
or
of
beams
for
dates
as
a
fact
exchange
has
never
completely
died
out
in
these
regions
and
at
the
present
day
in
chaldaea
as
in
egypt
corn
is
used
in
many
cases
either
to
pay
government
taxes
or
to
discharge
commercial
debts
the
commerce
of
the
chief
cities
was
almost
entirely
concentrated
in
the
temples

so
rapidly
that
they
would
have
overflowed
the
storehouses
had
not
a
means
been
devised
of
utilizing
them
quickly
the
priests
treated
them
as
articles
of

and
made
a
profit
out
of
them
every
bargain
necessitated
the
calling
in
of
a
public

the
bill
drawn
up
before
witnesses
on
a
clay
tablet
enumerated
the
sums
paid
out
the

of
the
parties
the
rate
per
the
date
of
repayment
and
sometimes
a
penal
clause
in
the
event
of
fraud
or
insolvency
the
tablet
remained
in
the
possession
of
the
creditor
until
the
debt
had
been
completely
discharged
the
borrower
often
gave
as
a
pledge
either
slaves
a
field
or
a
house
or
certain
of
his
friends
would
pledge
on
his
behalf
their
own
personal
fortune
at
times
he
would
pay
by
the
labour
of
his
own
hands
the
interest
which
he
would
otherwise
have
been
unable
to
meet
and
the
stipulation
was
previously
made
in
the
contract
of
the
number
of
days
of
corvee
which
he
should
periodically
fulfil
for
his
creditor
if
in
spite
of
all
this
the
debtor
was
unable
to
procure
the
necessary
funds
to
meet
his
engagements
the
principal
became
augmented
by
a
fixed
sum
for
instance
and
continued
to
increase
at
this
rate
until
the
total
value
of
the
amount
reached
that

ceased

former
master
subject
to
a
right
of
redemption
of
which
he
was
rarely
able
to
avail
himself
for
lack
of
means
it
was
to
the
god
himself
shamash
for
example
that
the
loan
was
supposed
to
be
made
and
it
is
to
him
that
the
contracts
stipulate
that
the
capital
and
interest
shall
be
paid
it

curious
to

most
successful
lenders

princesses

to
the
it
is
easy
to
foresee
from
the
contracts
of
the
new
assyrian
or
babylonian
empire
how
in
this
manner
the
original
sum
lent
became
doubled
and
trebled
generally
the
interest
accumulated
till
it
was
quadrupled
after
which
no
doubt
the
security
was
taken
by
the
creditor
they
probably
calculated
that
the
capital
and
compound
interest
was
by
then
equal
in
value
to
the
person
or
object
given
as
a
security
the
creditors
protected
themselves
against
this
right
of
redemption
by
a
maledictory
formula
inserted
at
the
end
of
the
contracts
against
those
who
should
avail
themselves
of
it
it
is
generally
inscribed
on
the
boundary
stones
of
the
first
chaldaean
empire
the
small
tradesman
or
free
workman
who
by
some
accident
had
become
involved
in
debt
seldom
escaped
this
progressive
impoverishment
except
by
strenuous
efforts
and
incessant
labour
foreign
commerce
it
is
true
entailed
considerable
risk
but
the
chances
of
acquiring
wealth
were
so
great
that
many
individuals
launched
upon
it
in
preference
to
more
sure
but
less
lucrative
undertakings
they
would
set
off
alone
or
in
companies
for
elam
or
the
northern
regions
for
syria
or
even
for
so
distant
a
country
as
egypt
and
they
would
bring
back
in
their
caravans
all
that
was
accounted
precious
in
those
lands
overland
routes
were
not
free
from
dangers
not
only
were
nomad
tribes
and
professional
bandits
constantly
hovering
round
the
traveller
and
obliging
him
to
exercise
ceaseless
vigilance
but
the
inhabitants
of
the
villages
through
which
he
passed
the
local
lords
and
the
kings
of
the
countries
which
he
traversed
had
no
scruple
in
levying
blackmail
upon
him
in
obliging
him
to
pay
dearly
for
right
of
way
through
their
marches
or
territory
there
were
less
risks
in
choosing
a
sea
route
the
euphrates
on
one
side
the
tigris
the
ulai
and
the
uknu
on
the
other
ran
through
a
country
peopled
with
a
rich
industrial
population
among
whom
chaldaean
merchandise
was
easily
and
profitably
sold
or
exchanged
for
commodities
which
would
command
a
good
price
at
the
end
of
the
voyage
the
vessels
generally
were
keleks
or
but
the
latter
were
of
immense
size
we
have
no
information
from
babylonian
sources
relating
to
the
state
of
the
roads
and
the
dangers
which
merchants
encountered
in
foreign
lands
the
egyptian
documents
partly
supply
what
is
here
lacking
the
contained
in
the
papyrus
no
show
what
were
the
miseries
of
the
traveller
and
the
of
allude
to
the
insecurity
of
the
roads
in
syria
by
the
very
care
with
which
the
hero
relates
all
the
precautions
which
he
took
for
his
protection
these
two
documents
are
of
the
xiith
or
xiiith
dynasty
that
is
to
say
contemporaneous
with
the
kings
of
uru
and
with
gudea
several
individuals
as
a
rule
would
club
together
to
hire
one
of
these
boats
and
freight
it
with
a
suitable
cargo
the
body
of
the
boat
was
very
light
being
made
of
osier
or
willow
covered
with
skins
sewn
together
a
layer
of
straw
was
spread
on
the
bottom
on
which
were
piled
the
bales
or
chests
which
were
again
protected
by
a
rough
thatch
of
straw
the
crew
was
composed
of
two
oarsmen
at
least
and
sometimes
a
few
donkeys
the
merchants
then
pursued
their
way
up
stream
till
they
had
disposed
of
their
cargo
and
taken
in
a
sufficient
freight
for
their
return
voyage
the
dangers
though
apparently
not
so
great
as
those
by
the
land
route
were
not
the
less
real
the
boat
was
liable
to
sink
or
run
aground
near
the
bank
the
dwellers
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
river
might
intercept
it
and
pillage
its
contents
a
war
might
break
out
between
two
contiguous
kingdoms
and
suspend
all
commerce
the
career
continually
vacillated
between
servitude
death
and
fortune
the
payment
demanded
was
something
considerable
the
only
contract
which
i
know
of
existing
for
such
a
transaction
is
of
the
time
of
darius
and
exacts
a
silver
shekel
per
day
for
the
hire
of
boat
and
crew
business
carried
on
at
home
in
the
towns
was
seldom
the
means
of
enriching
a
man
and
sometimes
scarcely
afforded
him
a
means
of
livelihood
rent
was
high
for
those
who
had
not
a
house
of
their
own
the
least
they
could
expect
to
pay
was
half
a
silver
shekel
per
annum
but
the
average
price
was
a
whole
shekel
on
taking
possession
they
paid
a
deposit
which
sometimes
amounted
to
of
the
whole
sum
the
remainder
being
due
at
the
end
of
the
year
the
leases
lasted
as
a
rule
merely
a
twelvemonth
though
sometimes
they
were
extended
for
terms
of
greater
length
such
as
two
three
or
even
eight
years
the
cost
of
repairs
and
of
keeping
the
house
in
good
condition
fell
usually
upon
the
lessee
who
was
also
allowed
to
build
upon
the
land
he
had
leased
in
which
case
it
was
declared
free
of
all
charges
for
a
period
of
about
ten
years
but
the
house
and
as
a
rule
all
he
had
built
then
reverted
to
the
landlord
most
possessors
of
shops
made
their
own
goods
for
sale
assisted
by
slaves
or
free
apprentices
every
workman
taught
his
own
trade
to
his
children
and
these
in
their
turn
would
instruct
theirs
families
which
had
an
hereditary
profession
or
from
generation
to
generation
had
gathered
bands
of
workmen
about
them
formed
themselves
into
various
guilds
or
to
use
the
customary
term
into
tribes
governed
by
chiefs
and
following
specified
customs
a
workman
belonged
to
the
tribe
of
the
weavers
or
of
the
blacksmiths
or
of
the
and
the
description
of
an
individual
would
not
have
been
considered
as
sufficiently
exact
if
the
designation
of
his
tribe
were
not
inserted
after
his
name
in
addition
to
his
paternal
affiliation
the
organization
was
like
that
of
egypt
but
more
fully
developed
the
various
trades
moreover
were
almost
the
same
among
the
two
peoples
the
exceptions
being
such
as
are
readily
accounted
for
by
the
differences
in
the
nature
of
the
soil
and
physical
constitution
of
the
respective
countries
we
do
not
meet
on
the
banks
of
the
euphrates
with
those
corporations
of
and
marble
workers
which
were
so
numerous
in
the
valley
of
the
nile
the
vast
chaldaean
plain
in
the
absence
of
mountains
or
accessible
quarries
would
have
furnished
no
occupation
for
them
the
chaldaeans
had
to
go
a
long
way
in
quest
of
the
small
quantities
of
limestone
alabaster
or
diorite
which
they
required
and
which
they
reserved
only
for
details
of
architectural
decoration
for
which
a
small
number
of
artisans
and
sculptors
were
amply
sufficient
the
manufacture
of
bricks
on
the
other
hand
made
great
progress
the
crude
bricks
were
larger
than
those
of
egypt
and
they
were
more
enduring
composed
of
finer
clay
and
better
executed
the
manufacture
of
burnt
brick
too
was
carried
to
a
degree
of
perfection
to
which
memphis
or
thebes
never
attained
an
ancient
legend
ascribes
the
invention
of
the
bricks
and
consequently
the
construction
of
the
earliest
cities
jointly
to
sin
the
eldest
son
of
bel
and
ninib
his
brother
this
event
was
said
to
have
taken
place
in
and
from
that
time
forward
the
third
month
of
the
year
over
which
the
twins
presided
was
called
murga
in
sumerian
simanu
in
the
semitic
speech
the
month
of
brick
this
was
the
season
which
was
especially
devoted
to
the
processes
of
their
manufacture
the
flood
in
the
rivers
which
was
very
great
in
the
preceding
months
then
began
to
subside
and
the
clay
which
was
deposited
by
the
waters
during
the
weeks
of
overflow
washed
and
refined
as
it
was
lent
itself
readily
to
the
operation
the
sun
moreover
gave
forth
sufficient
heat
to
dry
the
clay
blocks
in
a
uniform
and
gradual
manner
later
in
july
and
august
they
would
crack
under
the
ardour
of
his
rays
and
become
converted
externally
into
a
friable
mass
while
their
interior
would
remain
too
moist
to
allow
them
to
be
prudently
used
in
carefully
built
structures
the
work
of
was
inaugurated
with
festivals
and
sacrifices
to
sin
merodach
nebo
and
all
the
deities
who
were
concerned
in
the
art
of
building
further
religious
ceremonies
were
observed
at
intervals
during
the
month
to
sanctify
the
progress
of
the
work
the
manufacture
did
not
cease
on
the
last
day
of
the
month
but
was
continued
with
more
or
less
activity
according
to
the
heat
of
the
sun
and
the
importance
of
the
orders
received
until
the
return
of
the
inundation
but
the
bricks
intended
for
public
buildings
temples
or
palaces
could
not
be
made
outside
a
prescribed
limit
of
time
the
shades
of
colour
produced
naturally
in
the
process
of
burning
red
or
yellow
grey
or
brown
were
not
pleasant
to
the
eye
and
they
were
accustomed
therefore
to
coat
the
bricks
with
an
attractive
enamel
which
preserved
them
from
the
disintegrating
effects
of
sun
and
rain
the
paste
was
laid
on
the
edges
or
sides
while
the
brick
was
in
a
crude
state
and
was
incorporated
with
it
by
vitrification
in
the
heat
of
the
kiln
the
process
was
known
from
an
early
date
in
egypt
but
was
rarely
employed
there
in
the
decoration
of
buildings
while
in
chaldaea
the
use
of
such
enamelled
plaques
was
common
the
substructures
of
palaces
and
the
exterior
walls
of
temples
were
left
unadorned
but
the
shrines
which
crowned
the
the
and
the
headings
of
doors
were
covered
with
these
tiles
fragments
of
them
are
found
in
the
ruins
of
the
cities
and
the
analysis
of
these
pieces
shows
the
marvellous
skill
of
the
ancient
workers
in
enamel
the
shades
of
colour
are
pure
and
pleasant
to
the
eye
while
the
material
is
so
evenly
put
on
and
so
solid
that
neither
centuries
of
burial
in
a
sodden
soil
nor
the
wear
and
tear
of
transport
nor
the
exposure
to
the
damp
of
our
museums
have
succeeded
in
diminishing
their
brilliance
and
freshness
to
get
a
clear
idea
of
the
industrial
operations
of
the
country
it
would
be
necessary
to
see
the
various
corporations
at
their
work
as
we
are
able
to
do
in
the
case
of
egypt
in
the
scenes
of
the
mastabas
of
saqqara
or
of
the
of
the
manufacture
of
stone
implements
gave
considerable
employment
and
the
equipment
of
the
dead
in
the
tombs
of
uru
would
have
been
a
matter
of
small
moment
if
we
were
to
exclude
its
flint
implements
its
knives
cleavers
scrapers
adzes
axes
and
hammers
the
cutting
of
these
objects
is
bold
and
the
final
touches
show
skill
but
we
rarely
meet
with
that
purity
of
contour
and
intensity
of
polish
which
distinguish
similar
objects
among
western
peoples
a
few
examples
it
is
true
are
of
fairly
artistic
shape
and
bear
engraved
inscriptions
one
of
these
a
flint
hammer
of
beautiful
form
belonged
to
a
god
probably
eamman
and
seems
to
have
come
from
a
temple
in
which
one
of
its
owners
had
deposited

an
exception

a
remarkable
exception
stone
was
the
material
of
the
implements
of
the
poor
implements
which
were
coarse
in
shape
and
cost
little
if
much
care
were
given
to
their
execution
they
would
come
to
be
so
costly
that
no

would

them

sold
for
a
moderate
sum
the
seller
would
obtain
no
profit

as

the
case
among
peoples
the

precious
metals

much
facility
and
skill
we
have
not
succeeded
up
to
the
present
in

which
the
kings
were
accustomed
to
dedicate
in

temples
out
of

possessions
or
the
spoil
obtained
from
the
enemy
but
a
silver
vase
dedicated
to
ningirsu
by
entena
vicegerent
of
lagash
gives
us
some
idea
of
this
department
of
the
temple
furniture
it
stands
upright
on
a
small
square
bronze
pedestal
with
four
feet
a
piously
expressed
inscription
runs
round
the
neck
and
the
bowl
of
the
vase
is
divided
horizontally
into
two
divisions
framed
above
and
below
by
twisted
four
eagles
with
outspread
wings
and
tail
occupy
the
lower
division
they
are
in
the
act
of
seizing
with
their
claws
two
animals
placed
back
to
back
represented
in
the
act
of
walking
the
intervals
between
the
eagles
are
filled
up
alternatively
by
two
lions
two
wild
goats
and
two
stags
above
and
close
to
the
rise
of
the
neck
are
disposed
seven
heifers
lying
down
and
all
looking
in
the
same
direction
they
are
all
engraved
upon
the
flat
metal
and
are
without
relief
or
incrustation
the
whole
composition
is
harmoniously
put
together
the
posture
of
the
animals
and
their
general
form
are
well
conceived
and
boldly
rendered
but
the
details
of
the
mane
of
the
lions
and
the
feathers
of

this
single
example

be
sufficient
to
prove
that
the
early
chaldaens
were
not
a
whit
behind
the

they
had
to
be
rounded
reduced
to
the
proper
proportions
and
polished
before
the
subject
or

could
be
engraved
upon
them
with
the

drill
a

through

required
great
dexterity
and
some
of
the
lapidaries
from
a
dread
of
breaking
the
cylinder
either
did
not
pierce
it
at
all
or
merely
bored
a
shallow
hole
into
each
extremity
to
allow
it
to
roll
freely
in
its
metallic
mounting
the
tools
used
in
engraving
were
similar
to
those
employed
at
the
present
day
but
of
a
rougher
kind
the
burin
which
was
often
nothing
more
than
a
flint
point
marked
out
the
area
of
the
design
and
sketched
out
the
figures
the
saw
was
largely
employed
to
cut
away
the
depressions
when
these
required
no
detailed
handling
and
lastly
the
drill
either
worked
with
the
hand
or
in
a
kind
of
lathe
was
made
to
indicate
the
joints
and
muscles
of
the
individual
by
a
series
of
round
holes
the
object
thus
summarily
dealt
with
might
be
regarded
as
sufficiently
worked
for
ordinary
clients
but
those
who
were
willing
to
pay
for
them
could
obtain
cylinders
from
which
every
mark
of
the
tool
had
been
adroitly
removed

ingenuity
and
executed
with
a
boldness
which
modern

have
rarely
equalled
and
never

of

disfigured

exaggerated
prominence
of

and
hardness
of

but
there
are
also
all
the
qualities
which
distinguish
an
original
and
forcible
art
the
countries
of
the
euphrates
were
renowned
in
classic
times
for
the
beauty
of
the
embroidered
and
painted
stuffs
which
they
manufactured
nothing
has
come
down
to
us
of
these
babylonian
tissues
of
which
the
greek
and
latin
writers
extolled
the
magnificence
but
we
may
form
some
idea
from
the
statues
and
the
figures
engraved
on
cylinders
of
what
the
weavers
and
embroiderers
of
this
ancient
time
were
capable
the
loom
which
they
made
use
of
differed
but
slightly
from
the
horizontal
loom
commonly
employed
in
the
nile
valley
and
everything
tends
to
show
that
their
plain
linen
cloths
were
of
the
kind
represented
in
the
swathings
and
fragments
of
clothing
still
to
be
found
in
the
sepulchral
chambers
of
memphis
and
thebes
the
manufacture
of
fleecy
woollen
garments
so
much
affected
by
men
and
women
alike
indicates
a
great
dexterity
when
once
the
threads
of
the
woof
had
been
stretched
those
of
the
warp
were
attached
to
them
by
knots
in
as
many
parallel
lines
at
regular
intervals
as
there
were
rows
of
fringe
to
be
displayed
on
the
surface
of
the
cloth
the
loops
thus
formed
being
allowed
to
hang
down
in
their
respective
places
sometimes
these
loops
were
retained
just
as
they
stood
sometimes
they
were
cut
and
the
ends
frayed
out
so
as
to
give
the
appearance
of
a
shaggy
texture
most
modern
writers
understand
by
tapestry
what
the
ancients
were
accustomed
to
call
needle
embroidery
or
painting
on
stuffs
i
can
find
no
indication
on
the
most
ancient
monuments
of
chaldaean
or
egypt
of
the
manufacturing
of
real
tapestry

most
of
these
stuffs
preserved
their
original
white
or
creamy
colour
especially
those
woven
at
home
by
the
women
for
the
requirements
of
their
own
toilet
and
for
the
ordinary
uses
of
the
household
the
chaldaeans
however
like
many
other
asiatic
peoples
had
a
strong
preference
for
lively
colours
and
the
outdoor
garments
and
gala
attire
of
the
rich
were
distinguished
by
a
profusion
of
blue
patterns
on
a
red
ground
or
red
upon
blue
arranged
in
stripes
zigzags
checks
and
dots
or
circles
there
must
therefore
have
been
as
much
occupation
for
dyers
as
there
was
for
weavers
and
it
is
possible
that
the
two
operations
were
carried
out
by
the
same
hands
we
know
nothing
of
the
bakers
butchers
carriers
masons
and
other
artisans
who
supplied
the
necessities
of
the
cities
they
were
doubtless
able
to
make
two
ends
meet
and
nothing
more
and
if
we
should
succeed
some
day
in
obtaining
information
about
them
we
shall
probably
find
that
their
condition
was
as
miserable
as
that
of
their
egyptian
contemporaries
the
course
of
their
lives
was
monotonous
enough
except
when
it
was
broken
at
prescribed
intervals
by
the
ordinary
festivals
in
honour
of
the
gods
of
the
city
or
by
the
casual
suspensions
of
work
occasioned
by
the
triumphant
return
of
the
king
from
some
warlike
expedition
or
by
his
inauguration
of
a
new
temple
the
gaiety
of
the
people
on
such
occasions
was
the
more
exuberant
in
proportion
to
the
undisturbed
monotony
or
misery
of
the
days
which
preceded
them
as
soon
for
instance
as
gudea
had
brought
to
completion
ininnu
the
house
of
his
patron
ningirsu
felt
relieved
from
the
strain
and
washed
his
hands
for
seven
days
no
grain
was
bruised
in
the
quern
the
maid
was
the
equal
of
her
mistress
the
servant
walked
in
the
same
rank
as
his
master
the
strong
and
the
weak
rested
side
by
side
in
the
the
world
seemed
as
during
the
roman
saturnalia
the
classes
mingled
together
and
the
inferiors
were
probably
accustomed
to
abuse
the
unusual
licence
which
they
momentarily
enjoyed
when
the
festival
was
over
social
distinctions
reasserted
themselves
and
each
one
fell
back
into
his
accustomed
position
life
was
not
so
pleasant
in
chaldaea
as
in
egypt
the
innumerable
promissory
notes
the
receipted
accounts
the
contracts
of
sale
and
purchase
these
cunningly
drawn
up
deeds
which
have
been
deciphered
by
the
hundred
reveal
to
us
a
people
greedy
of
gain
exacting
litigious
of
artisans
in
egypt
this
is
taken
from
a
source
belonging
to
the
xiith
or
possibly
the
xiiith
dynasty
we
may
assume
from
the
fact
that
the
two
civilizations
were
about
on
the
same
level
that
the
information
supplied
in
this
respect
by
the
egyptian
monuments
is
generally
applicable
to
the
condition
of
chaldaean
workmen
of
the
same
period
unreadable
and
almost
exclusively
absorbed
by
material
concerns
the
climate
too
variable
and
oppressive
in
summer
and
winter
alike
imposed
upon
the
chaldaean
painful
exactions
and
obliged
him
to
work
with
an
energy
of
which
the
majority
of
egyptians
would
not
have
felt
themselves
capable
the
chaldaean
suffering
greater
and
more
prolonged
hardships
earned
more
doubtless
but
was
not
on
this
account
the
happier
however
lucrative
his
calling
might
be
it
was
not
sufficiently
so
to
supply
him
always
with
domestic
necessities
and
both
tradespeople
and
operatives
were
obliged
to
run
into
debt
to
supplement
their
straitened
means
when
they
had
once
fallen
into
the
hands
of
the
usurer
the
exorbitant
interest
which
they
had
to
pay
kept
them
a
long
time
in
his
power
if
when
the
bill
fell
due
there
was
nothing
to
meet
it
it
had
to
be
renewed
under
still
more
disastrous
conditions
as
the
pledge
given
was
usually
the
homestead
or
the
slave
who
assisted
in
the
trade
or
the
garden
which
supplied
food
for
the
family
the
mortgagor
was
reduced
to
the
extreme
of
misery
if
he
could
not
satisfy
his
creditors
this
plague
of
usury
was
not
moreover
confined
to
the
towns
it
raged
with
equal
violence
in
the
country
and
the
farmers
also
became
its
victims
if
theoretically
the
earth
belonged
to
the
gods
and
under
them
to
the
kings
the
latter
had
made
and
continued
daily
to
make
such
large
concessions
of
it
to
their
vassals
that
the
greater
part
of
their
domains
were
always
in
the
hands
of
the
nobles
or
private
individuals
these
could
dispose
of
their
landed
property
at
pleasure
farm
it
out
sell
it
or
distribute
it
among
their
heirs
and
friends
they
paid
on
account
of
it
a
tax
which
varied
at
different
epochs
but
which
was
always
burthensome
but
when
they
had
once
satisfied
this
exaction
and
paid
the
dues
which
the
temples
might
claim
on
behalf
of
the
gods
neither
the
state
nor
any
individual
had
the
right
to
interfere
in
their
administration
of
it
or
put
any
restrictions
upon
them
some
proprietors
cultivated
their
lands
themselves
the
poor
by
their
own
labour
the
rich
by
the
aid
of
some
trustworthy
slave
whom
they
interested
in
the
success
of
his
farming
by
assigning
him
a
certain
percentage
on
the
net
return
sometimes
the
lands
were
leased
out
in
whole
or
in
part
to
free
peasants
who
relieved
the
proprietors
of
all
the
worry
and
risks
of
managing
it
themselves
a
survey
of
the
area
of
each
state
had
been
made
at
an
early
age
and
the
lots
into
which
it
had
been
divided
were
registered
on
clay
tablets
containing
the
name
of
the
proprietor
as
well
as
those
of
his
neighbours
together
with
such
indications
of
the
features
of
the

serve
to
define
its
boundaries

in
the
most
complicated
instances
interpreted
it
to
the
eye
this
survey
was
frequently
repeated
and
enabled
the
sovereign
to
arrange
his
scheme
of
taxation
on
a
solid
basis
and
to
calculate
the
product
of
it

their

accompanied

are
handled
with
gravity
and
freedom
if
we
sometimes
encounter
episodes
which
provoke
a
smile
or
excite
our
repugnance
we
must
take
into
account
the
rudeness
of
the
age
with
which
they
deal
and
remember
that
the
men
and
gods
of
the
later
homeric
epic
are
not
a
whit
behind
the
heroes
of
babylonian
story
in
coarseness
the
recognition
of
divine
omnipotence
and
the
keenly
felt
afflictions
of
the
soul
awakened
in
the
chaldaean
psalmist
feelings
of
adoration
and
penitence
which
still
find
in
spite
of
the
differences

echo

our

the

scribe

related
the

with
a
certain
gloomy
energy
the
miseries
of
the
without
return
instances
are
to
be
regarded
however
as
exceptional
the
bulk
of

literature
seems
nothing
more
than
a
heap
of
pretentious
trash
in
which
even
the
reader
can
see
no
meaning

if
he
can
it

its

us
to
belong

utterly
different
from
our
own
the
names

its

do
not
appeal
to
our
imagination
like
those
of
the
olympian
cycle
and
no
traditional
respect
serves
to
do
away
with
the
sense
of
uncouthness
which
we
experience
from
the
jingle
of
syllables
which
enter
into
them
its
artists
did
not
regard
the
world
from
the

point
of
view
as
we
do

its
writers
drawing
their
inspiration
from
an
entirely
different
source
made
use
of
obsolete
methods
to
express
their
feelings
and
their
ideas
it
thus
happens
that
while
we
understand
to
a
shade
the
classical
language
of
the
greeks
and
romans
and
can
read
their
works
almost
without
effort
the
great
primitive
literatures
of
the
world
the
egyptian
and
chaldaean
have
nothing
to
offer
us
for
the
most
part
but
a
sequence
of
problems
to
solve
or
of
enigmas
to
unriddle
with
patience
how
many
phrases
how
many
words
at
which
we
stumble
require
a
painstaking
analysis
before
we
can
make
ourselves
master
of
their
meaning
and
even
when
we
have
determined
to
our
satisfaction
their
literal
signification
what
a
number
of
excursions
we
must
make
in
the
domain
of
religious
ethical
and
political
history
before
we
can
compel
them
to
render
up
to
us
their
full
import
or
make
them
as
intelligible
to
others
as
they
are
to
ourselves
when
so
many
commentaries
are
required
to
interpret
the
thought
of
an
individual
or
a
people
some
difficulty
must
be
experienced

estimating
the
value
of
the

which
they
have
given
to
it

of
beauty

certainly
and

within

the

it
the

in
our
efforts

the

in
as
far
as
these
had
an
application
to
the
affairs
of
everyday
life
the
difference
between
the
two
peoples
consisted
chiefly
in
their
respective
numerical
systems
the
egyptians
employing
almost
exclusively
the
decimal
system
of
notation

the
chaldaeans
combined
its
use

intimate
alliance

indeed
it
could
hardly
be
otherwise
when
we
come
to
consider
the
chaldaean
outlook
upon
the
universe
its
operations
in
their
eyes
were
not
carried
on
under
impersonal
and
unswerving
laws

by
voluntary
and
rational
agents
swayed
by
an
inexorable
fate
against
which
they
dared
not
rebel

still

and
powerful

avert
by
magic

decrees
of
destiny

at

to
retard
their
execution

material
facts

its
competence

the
position
of
the
stars

the

revealed
themselves

manifestations
their
names

their
characteristics

once
it
had
obtained
this

lay
its

upon

could
compel

to
work

thus
nothing

of
solar
eclipses
were
followed
some
fourteen
days
and
a
half
after
by
an
eclipse
of
the
moon

were
unable
to
take
sufficient
advantage
of
this
experience
to
predict
with
certainty
the
instant
of
a
future
eclipse
of
the
sun

they
had
been

struck
with
the
connection

to
believe
that

announce

they
were
frequently
deceived
in

more
than
one
eclipse
which
they
had

did
not
take

their

earliest
astronomers
by

assiduous
contemplation

had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
vicissitudes
of
the
heavenly
bodies
were
in
fixed
relations
with
mundane
phenomena

events

displayed

would
cease
therein
and
justice
would
triumph
over
iniquity
the
first
observer
who
was
struck
by
this
coincidence
noted
it
down
his
successors
confirmed
his
observations
and
at
length
deduced
in
the
process
of
the
years
from
their
accumulated
knowledge
a
general
law
henceforward
each
time
that
mercury
assumed
the
same
aspect
it
was
of
favourable
augury
and
kings
and
their
subjects
became
the
recipients
of
his
bounty
as
long
as
he
maintained
this
appearance
no
foreign
ruler
could
install
himself
in
chaldaea
tyranny

be
divided
against
itself
equity
would
prevail
and
a

monarch
bear

the
landholders
and
the
king
would
be
confirmed
in
their
privileges
and
obedience
together
with
tranquillity
would
rule
everywhere
in
the
land
the
number
of
these
observations
increased
to
such
a
degree
that
it
was
found
necessary
to
classify
them
methodically
to
avoid
confusion
tables
of
them
were
drawn
up
in

the
reader
could
see
at
one

then
happening

to
happen

with

and
the
division
of
his
empire
it
was
not
for
nothing
that
the
sun
and

surrounded
themselves
in
the
evening
with
vapours
or
veiled
themselves
in
dark
clouds

they
grew
suddenly

red
after
having
been
intensely
bright

unexpected
fires
blazed
out

many
warnings
granted

rulers
consulted
and
imposed
upon
the
astronomers
the
duty
of
selecting
the
most
favourable
moment
for
the
execution
of
the
projects
they
had
in
view
from
an
early
date
each
temple
contained
a
library
of
astrological
writings
where
the
people
might
find
drawn
up
as
in
code
the
signs
which
bore
upon
their
destinies
one
of
these
libraries
consisting
of
not
less
than
seventy
clay
tablets
is
considered
to
have
been
first
drawn
up
in
the
reign
of
sargon
of
agade
but
to
have
been
so
modified
and
enriched
with
new
examples
from
time
to
time
that
the
original
is
lost
this
was
the
classical
work
on
the
subject
in
the
viith
century
before
our
era
and
the
to
whom
applications
were
accustomed
to
be
made
to
explain
a
natural
phenomenon
or
a
prodigy
drew
their
answers
from
it
astronomy
as
thus
understood
was
not
merely
the
queen
of
sciences
it
was
the
mistress
of
the
world
taught
secretly
in
the
temples
its
adepts
at
least
those
who
had
passed
through
the
regular
curriculum
of
study
which
it
required
became
almost
a
distinct
class
in
society
the
occupation
was
a
lucrative
one
and
its
accomplished
professors
had
numerous
rivals
whose
educational
antecedents
were
unknown
but
who
excited
the
envy
of
the
experts
in
their
trading
upon
the
credulity
of
the
people
these
quacks
went
about
the
country
drawing
up
horoscopes
and
arranging
schemes
of
birthday
prognostications
of
which
the
majority
were
without
any
authentic
warranty
the
law
sometimes
took
note
of
the
fact
that
they
were
competing
with
the
official
experts
and
interfered
with
their
business
but
if
they
happened
to
be
exiled
from
one
city
they
found
some
neighbouring
one
ready
to
receive
them
chaldaea
abounded
with
soothsayers
and
necromancers
no
less
than
with
astrologers
she
possessed
no
real
school
of
medicine
such
as
we
find
in
egypt
in
which
were
taught
rational
methods
of
diagnosing
maladies
and
of
curing
them
by
the
use
of
simples
the
chaldaeans
were
content
to
confide
the
care
of
their
bodies
to
sorcerers
and
exorcists
who
were
experts
in
the
art
of
casting
out
demons
and
spirits
whose
presence
in
a
living
being
brought
about
those
disorders
to
which
humanity
is
prone
the
facial
expression
of
the
patient
during
the
crisis
the
words
which
escaped
from
him
in
delirium
were
for
these
clever
individuals
so
many
signs
revealing
the
nature
and
sometimes
the
name
of
the
enemy
to
be
combated
the
the
the
consultations
and
medical
treatment
were
therefore
religious
offices
in
which
were
involved
purifications
offerings
and
a
whole
ritual
of
mysterious
words
and
gestures
the
magician
lighted
a
fire
of
herbs
and
plants
in
front
of
his
patient
and
the
clear
flame
arising
from
this
put
the
spectres
to
flight
and
dispelled
the
malign
influences
a
prayer
describing
the
enchantments
and
their
effects
being
afterwards
recited
baleful
imprecation

a

fallen

fallen
upon

direful
wail
has
fallen

the
baleful

the

in
the

this
man
the
baleful
imprecation
slaughters
him
like
a
sheep
for
his
god
has
quitted
his
body
his
goddess
has
withdrawn
herself
in
displeasure
from
him
a
wail
of

has
spread
itself
as

upon
him
and
has
overtaken
him
the
harm
done
by
the
magician

be
repaired
by
the

and
merodach

betimes
merodach
cast

of

and
break

draw
away
the

is
upon

the

which
afflicts
his

which
he
suffers
by
reason
of
the
curse
of
his

or
the
curse
of
his

or
the

of
his

brother
or
by
the
curse
of
a
murderess
who
is
unknown
to
the
the
curse
may
it
be
taken
from
him
by
the
charm
of
ea
like
a

of

which
is
stripped

by

off
like
a

may

the
spell
may
heaven
avert
it
may
the
earth
avert
it
the
god
himself
deigned
to
point
out
the
remedy
the
sick
man
was
to
take
a
clove
of
garlic
some
dates
and
a
stalk
bearing
flowers
and
was
to
throw
them
into
the
fire
bit
by
bit
repeating
appropriate
prayers
at
each
stage
of
the
operation
like
manner
as
this
garlic
is
peeled
and
thrown
into
the
fire
and
the
burning
flame
consumes
it
as
it
will
never
be
planted
in
the
vegetable
garden
it
will
never
draw
moisture
from
the
pond
or
from
the
ditch
its
root
will
never
again
spread
in
the
earth
its
stalk
will
not
pierce
the
ground
and
behold
the
sun
it
will
not
serve
as
food
for
the
gods
or
the
king
so
may
it
remove
the
baleful
curse
so
may
it
loose
the
bond
of
sickness
of
sin
of
shortcomings
of
perversity
of
crime
the
sickness
which
is
in
my
body
in
my
flesh
in
my
muscles
like
this
garlic
may
it
be
stripped
off
and
may
the
burning
flame
consume
it
in
this
day
may
the
spell
of
the
sorcerer
be
cast
out
that
i
may
behold
the
light
the
ceremony
could
be
prolonged
at
will
the
sick
person
pulled
to
pieces
the
cluster
of
dates
the
bunch
of
flowers
a
fleece
of
wool
some
hair
a
skein
of
dyed
thread
and
a
bean
which
were
all
in
turn
consumed
in
the
fire
at
each
stage
of
the
operation
he
repeated
the
formula
introducing
into
it
one
or
two
expressions
characterizing
the
nature
of
the
particular
offering
as
for
instance
dates
will
no
more
hang
from
their
stalks
the
leaves
of
the
branch
will
never
again
be
united
to
the
tree
the
wool
and
the
hair
will
never
again
lie
on
the
back
of
the
animal
on
which
they
grew
and
will
never
be
used
for
weaving
the
use
of
magical
words
was
often
accompanied
by
remedies
which
were
for
the
most
part
both
grotesque
and
disgusting
in
their
composition
they
comprised
bitter
or
stinking
raw
meat
flesh
wine
and
oil
the
whole
reduced
to
a
pulp
or
made
into
a
sort
of
pill
and
swallowed
on
the
chance
of
its
bringing
relief
the
egyptian
physicians
employed
similar
compounds
to
which
they
attributed
wonderful
effects
but
they
made
use
of
them
in
exceptional
circumstances
only
the
medical
authorities
in
chaldaea
recommended
them
before
all
others
and
their
very
strangeness
reassured
the
patient
as
to
their
efficacy
they
filled
the
possessing
spirits
with
disgust
and
became
a
means
of
relief
owing
to
the
invincible
horror
with
which
they
inspired
the
persecuting
demons
the
chaldaeans
were
not
however
ignorant
of
the
natural
virtues
of
herbs
and
at
times
made
use
of
them
but
they
were
not
held
in
very
high
esteem
and
the
physicians
preferred
the
prescriptions
which
pandered
to
the
popular
craving
for
the
supernatural
amulets
further
confirmed
the
effect
produced
by
the
recipes
and
prevented
the
enemy
once
cast
out
from
the
body
these
amulets
were
made
of
knots
of
cord
pierced
shells
bronze
or
statuettes
and
plaques
fastened
to
the
arms
or
worn
round
the
neck
on
each
of
the
latter
kind
were
roughly
drawn
the
most
terrible
images
that
they
could
conceive
a
shortened
incantation
was
scrawled
on
its
surface
or
it
was
covered
with
extraordinary
characters
which
when
the
spirits
perceived
they
at
once
took
flight
and
the
possessor
of
the
talisman
escaped
the
threatened
illness
however
laughable
and
at
the
same
time
deplorable
this
hopeless
medley
of
exact
knowledge
and
gross
superstition
may
appear
to
us
at
the
present
day
it
was
the
means
of
bringing
a
prosperity
to
the
cities
of
chaldaea
which
no
amount
of
actual
science
would
ever
have
produced
the
neighbouring
barbaric
peoples
were
imbued
with
the
same
ideas
as
the
chaldaens
regarding
the
constitution
of
the
world
and
the
nature
of
the
laws
which
governed
it
they
lived
likewise
in
perpetual
fear
of
those
invisible
beings
whose
changeable
and
arbitrary
will
actuated
all
visible
phenomena
they
attributed
all
the
reverses
and
misfortunes
which
overtook
them
to
the
direct
action
of
these
malevolent
beings
they
believed
firmly
in
the
influence
of
stars
on
the
course
of
events
they
were
constantly
on
the
look
out
for
prodigies
and
were
greatly
alarmed
by
them
since
they
had
no
certain
knowledge
of
the
number
and
nature
of
their
enemies
and
the
means
they
had
invented
for
protecting
themselves
from
them
or
of
overcoming
them
too
often
proved
inefficient
in
the
eyes
of
these
barbarians
the
chaldeans
seemed
to
be
possessed
of
the
very
powers
which
they
themselves
lacked
the
magicians
of
chaldaea
had
forced
the
demons
to
obey
them
and
to
unmask
themselves
before
them
they
read
with
ease
in
the
heavens
the
present
and
future
of
men
and
nations
they
interpreted
the
will
of
the
immortals
in
its
smallest
manifestations
and
with
them
this
faculty
was
not
a
limited
and
ephemeral
power
quickly
exhausted
by
use
the
rites
and
formulas
known
to
them
enabled
them
to
exercise
it
freely
at
all
times
in
all
places
alike
upon
the
most
exalted
of
the
gods
and
the
most
dreaded
of
mortals

indeed
destined
to
triumph
over
its
neighbours

have
no

she
crossed

the
lists
of
the
pharaohs
of
the
memphite
period
appear
to
have
been
drawn
up
in
much
the
same
order
as
we
now
possess
them
as
early
as
the
xiith
dynasty
it
is
certain
that
the
sequence
was
definitely
fixed
about
the
time
of
the
xxth
dynasty
since
it
was
under
this
that
the
canon
of
turin
was
copied
the
lists
which
have
come
down
to
us
appear
to
follow
two
traditions
which
differ
completely
in
certain
cases
one
has
been
preserved
for
us
by
the
abbreviators
of
manetho
while
the
other
was
the
authority
followed
by
the
compilers
of
the
tables
of
abydos
and
saqqara
as
well
as
by
the
author
of
the
turin
papyrus
there
appear
to
have
been
in
the
first
five
dynasties
a
certain
number
of
kings
whose
exact
order
and
filiation
were
supposed
to
be
well
known
to
the
compilers
but
at
the
same
time
there
were
others
whose
names
were
found
on
the
monuments
but
whose
position
with
regard
to
their
predecessors
was
indicated
neither
by
historical
documents
nor
by
popular
romance
we
find
therefore
in
these
two
traditional
lists
a
series
of
sovereigns
always
occupying
the
same
position
and
others
hovering
around
them
who
have
no
decided
place
the
hieroglyphic
lists
and
the
royal
canon
appear
to
have
been
chiefly
concerned
with
the
former
but
the
authorities
followed
by
manetho
have
studiously
collected
the
names
of
the
latter
and
have
intercalated
them
in
different
places
sometimes
in
the
middle
but
mostly
at
the
end
of
the
dynasty
where
they
form
a
kind
of
the
most
striking
example
of
this
arrangement
is
afforded
us
in
the
ivth
dynasty
the
contemporary
monuments
show
that
its
kings
formed
a
compact
group
to
which
are
appended
the
first
three
sovereigns
of
the
vth
dynasty
always
in
the
same
order
menkauri
succeeded
khafri
shopsiskaf
followed
menkauri
usirkaf
followed
shopsiskaf
and
so
on
to
the
end
the
lists
of
manetho
suppress
shopsiskaf
and
substitute
four
other
individuals
in
his
place
namely
katoises
bikheris
seberkheres
thamphthis
whose
reigns
must
have
occupied
more
than
half
a
century
these
four
were
doubtless
aspirants
to
the
throne
or
local
kings
belonging
to
the
time
between
the
ivth
and
vth
dynasties
whom
authorities
inserted
between
the
compact
groups
made
up
of
kheops
and
his
sons
on
the
one
hand
and
of
usirkaf
and
his
two
real
of
supposed
brothers
on
the
other
omitting
shopsiskaf
and
having
no
idea
that
usirkaf
was
his
immediate
successor
with
or
without
rivals
to
the
throne
in
a
course
of
lectures
given
at
the
de
i
have
examined
at
length
the
questions
raised
by
a
study
of
the
various
lists
and
i
may
be
able
perhaps
some
day
to
publish
the
result
of
my
researches
for
the
present
i
must
confine
myself
merely
to
what
is
necessary
to
the
elucidation
of
the
present
work
namely
the
manethonian
tradition
on
the
one
hand
and
the
tradition
of
the
monumental
tables
on
the
other
the
text
which
i
propose
to
follow
for
the
latter
during
the
first
five
dynasties
is
that
of
the
second
table
of
abydos
the
names
placed
between
brackets
are
taken
either
from
the
table

saqqara

by
the
fragments
of
the
turin
papyrus
and
by
information
supplied
by
the
monuments
no
such
definitely
established
sequence
appears
to
have
existed
for
this
period
as
for
the
preceding
ones
the
heracleopolitan
dynasties
figure
perhaps
in
the
canon
of
turin
only
as
for
the
later
memphite
dynasties
the
table
of
abydos
gives
one
series
of
pharaohs
while
the
canon
adopts
a
different
one
after
the
close
of
the
vith
dynasty
and
before
the
accession
of
the
ixth
there
was
doubtless
a
period
when
several
branches
of
the
royal
family
claimed
the
supremacy
and
ruled
in
different
parts
of
egypt
this
is
what
we
know
to
have
taken
place
later
between
the
xxiind
and
the
xxivth
dynasties
the
tradition
of
abydos
had
perhaps
adopted
one
of
these
contemporaneous
dynasties
while
the
turin
papyrus
had
chosen
another
manetho
on
the
other
hand
had
selected
from
among
them
as
representatives
of
the
legitimate
succession
the
line
reigning
at
memphis
which
immediately
followed
the
sovereigns
of
the
vith
dynasty
the
following
table
gives
both
the
series
known
as
far
as
it
is
possible
for
the
present
to
the
order
illustration
lists
on
the
monuments
the
xith
theban
dynasty
contains
but
a
small
number
of
kings
according
to
the
official
lists
the
tables
on
the
monuments
recognize
only
two
nibkhrouri
and
sonkhkari
but
the
turin
canon
admits
at
least
half
a
dozen
these
differences
probably
arose
from
the
fact
that
the
second
heracleopolitan
dynasty
having
reigned
at
the
same
time
as
the
earlier
theban
princes
the
tables
on
the
monuments
while
rejecting
the
heracleopolitans
recognized
as
legitimate
pharaohs
only
those
of
the
theban
kings
who
had
ruled
over
the
whole
of
egypt
namely
the
first
and
last
of
the
series
the
canon
on
the
contrary
replaced
the
later
heracleopolitans
by
those
among
the
contemporary
thebans
who
had
assumed
the
royal
titles
whatever
may
have
been
the
cause
of
these
combinations
we
find
the
lists
again
harmonizing
with
the
accession
of
the
xiith
theban
dynasty
for
the
succeeding
dynasties
we
possess
merely
the
names
enumerated
on
the
fragments
of
the
turin
papyrus
several
of
which
however
are
also
found
either
in
the
royal
chamber
at
karnak
or
on
contemporary
monuments
the
order
of
the
names
is
not
always
certain
it
is
perhaps
best
to
transcribe
the
sequence
as
we
are
able
to
gather
it
from
the
fragments
of
the
royal
papyrus
without
attempting
to
distinguish
between
those
which
belong
to
the
xiiith
and
those
which
must
be
relegated
to
the
following
dynasties
illustration
lists
on
the
monuments
about
fifty
names
still
remain
but
so
mutilated
and
scattered
over
such
small
fragments
of
papyrus
that
their
order
is
most
uncertain
we
possess
monuments
of
about
of
these
kings
and
the
lengths
of
their
reigns
as
far
as
we
know
them
all
appear
to
have
been
short
we
have
no
reason
to
doubt
that
they
did
really
govern
and
we
can
only
hope
that
in
time
the
progress
of
excavation
will
yield
us
records
of
them
one
after
another
they
bring
us
down
to
the
period
of
the
invasion
of
the
shepherds
and
it
is
possible
that
some
among
them
may
be
found
to
be
contemporaries
of
the
xvth
and
xvith
dynasties
