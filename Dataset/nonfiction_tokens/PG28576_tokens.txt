note
this
work
originally
appeared
in
saturday
evening
under
the
title
on
the
cutting
it
out
chapter
i
why
i
quit
first
off
let
me
state
the
object
of
the
meeting
this
is
to
be
a
record
of
sundry
experiences
centering
round
a
stern
resolve
to
get
on
the
waterwagon
and
a
sterner
attempt
to
stay
there
it
is
an
entirely
personal
narrative
of
a
strictly
personal
set
of
circumstances
it
is
not
a
temperance
lecture
or
a
temperance
tract
or
a
chunk
of
advice
or
a
shuddering
recital
of
the
woes
of
a
horrible
example
or
a
warning
or
an
admonition
or
anything
at
all
but
a
plain
tale
of
an
adventure
that
started
out
rather
vaguely
and
wound
up
rather
satisfactorily
i
am
no
brand
that
was
snatched
from
the
burning
no
sot
who
picked
himself
or
was
picked
from
the
gutter
no
drunkard
who
almost
wrecked
a
promising
career
no
constitutional
or
congenital
souse
i
drank
liquor
the
same
way
hundreds
of
thousands
of
men
drink
it
drank
liquor
and
attended
to
my
business
and
got
along
well
and
kept
my
health
and
provided
for
my
family
and
maintained
my
position
in
the
community
i
felt
i
had
a
perfect
right
to
drink
liquor
just
as
i
had
a
perfect
right
to
stop
drinking
it
i
never
considered
my
drinking
in
any
way
immoral
i
was
decent
respectable
a
gentleman
who
drank
only
with
gentlemen
and
as
a
gentleman
should
drink
if
he
pleases
i
did
care
whether
any
one
else
drank
and
do
not
now
i
did
care
whether
any
one
else
cared
whether
i
drank
and
do
not
now
i
am
no
reformer
no
lecturer
no
preacher
i
quit
because
i
wanted
to
not
because
i
had
to
i
swear
off
nor
take
any
vow
nor
sign
any
pledge
i
am
no
moral
censor
it
is
even
possible
that
i
might
go
out
this
afternoon
and
take
a
drink
i
am
quite
sure
i
shall
not
but
i
might
as
far
as
my
trip
into
teetotal
land
is
concerned
it
is
an
individual
proposition
and
nothing
else
i
am
no
example
for
other
men
who
drink
as
much
as
i
did
or
more
or
less
but
i
assume
my
experiences
are
somewhat
typical
for
i
am
sure
my
drinking
was
very
typical
and
a
recital
of
those
experiences
and
the
conclusions
thereon
is
what
is
before
the
house
i
quit
drinking
because
i
quit
drinking
i
had
a
very
fair
batting
average
in
the
booze
league
as
good
as
i
thought
necessary
and
i
knew
if
i
stopped
when
my
record
was
good
the
situation
would
be
satisfactory
to
me
whether
it
was
to
any
other
person
or
not
moreover
i
figured
it
out
that
the
time
to
stop
drinking
was
when
it
was
necessary
to
stop
not
when
it
was
necessary
i
had
been
observing
during
the
twenty
years
i
had
been
drinking
more
or
less
and
i
had
known
a
good
many
men
who
stopped
drinking
when
the
doctors
told
them
to
furthermore
it
had
been
my
observation
that
when
a
doctor
tells
a
man
to
stop
drinking
it
usually
does
make
much
difference
whether
he
stops
or
not
in
a
good
many
cases
he
might
just
as
well
keep
on
and
die
happily
for
he
going
to
die
anyhow
and
the
few
months
he
will
grab
through
his
abstinence
will
not
amount
to
anything
when
the
miseries
of
that
abstinence
are
duly
chalked
up
in
the
debit
column
therefore
applying
the
cold
hard
logic
of
the
situation
to
it
i
decided
to
beat
the
liquor
to
it
that
was
the
reason
for
stopping
purely
selfish
personal
individual
and
not
concerned
with
the
welfare
of
any
other
person
on
earth
just
myself
i
had
taken
good
care
of
myself
physically
and
i
knew
i
was
sound
everywhere
i
was
sure
how
long
i
could
keep
sound
and
continue
drinking
so
i
decided
to
stop
drinking
and
keep
sound
i
noticed
that
a
good
many
men
of
the
same
age
as
myself
and
the
same
habits
as
myself
were
beginning
to
show
signs
of
wear
and
tear
a
number
of
them
blew
up
with
various
disconcerting
maladies
and
a
number
more
died
soon
after
i
was
forty
years
of
age
i
noticed
i
began
to
go
to
funerals
oftener
than
i
had
been
doing
funerals
of
men
between
forty
and
i
had
known
socially
and
convivially
that
these
funerals
occurred
quite
regularly
and
that
the
doctor
certificate
more
times
than
not
gave
bright
disease
and
other
similar
diseases
in
the
column
all
of
these
funerals
were
of
men
who
were
good
fellows
and
we
mourned
their
loss
also
we
generally
took
a
few
drinks
to
their
memories
then
came
a
time
when
this
funeral
business
landed
on
me
like
a
inside
of
a
year
four
or
five
of
the
men
i
had
known
best
the
men
i
had
loved
best
the
men
who
had
been
my
real
friends
and
my
companions
died
one
after
another
also
some
other
friends
developed
physical
derangements
i
knew
were
directly
traceable
to
too
much
liquor
both
the
deaths
and
the
derangements
had
liquor
as
a
contributing
if
not
as
a
direct
cause
nobody
said
that
of
course
but
i
knew
it
so
i
held
a
caucus
with
myself
i
called
myself
into
convention
and
discussed
the
proposition
somewhat
like
this
you
are
now
over
forty
years
of
age
you
are
sound
physically
and
you
are
no
weaker
mentally
than
you
have
always
been
so
far
as
can
be
discovered
by
the
outside
world
you
have
had
a
lot
of
fun
much
of
it
complicated
with
the
conviviality
that
comes
with
drinking
and
much
of
it
not
so
complicated
but
you
have
done
your
share
of
plain
and
fancy
drinking
and
it
has
landed
you
yet
there
is
absolutely
no
nutriment
in
being
dead
that
gets
you
nothing
save
a
few
obituary
notices
you
will
never
see
there
is
even
less
in
being
sick
and
sidling
around
in
everybody
way
it
as
sure
as
sunset
if
you
keep
on
at
your
present
gait
that
john
barleycorn
will
land
you
just
as
he
has
landed
a
lot
of
other
people
you
know
and
knew
there
are
two
methods
of
procedure
open
to
you
one
is
to
keep
it
up
and
continue
having
the
fun
you
think
you
are
having
and
take
what
is
inevitably
coming
to
you
the
other
is
to
quit
it
while
the
quitting
is
good
and
live
a
few
more
years
that
may
not
be
so
rosy
but
probably
will
have
compensations
i
viewed
it
from
every
angle
i
could
think
of
i
knew
what
sort
of
a
job
i
had
laid
out
to
tackle
if
i
quit
i
weighed
the
whole
thing
in
my
mind
in
the
light
of
my
acquaintances
my
experiences
my
position
my
mode
of
life
my
business
i
had
been
through
it
many
times
i
had
often
gone
on
the
waterwagon
for
periods
varying
in
length
from
three
days
to
three
months
i
was
venturing
into
any
uncharted
territory
i
knew
every
signpost
every
crossroad
every
foot
of
the
ground
i
knew
the
difficulties
knew
them
by
heart
i
was
deluding
myself
with
any
assertions
of
superior
or
superior
courage
or
superior
anything
i
knew
i
had
a
fixed
daily
habit
of
drinking
and
that
if
i
quit
drinking
i
should
have
to
reorganize
the
entire
works
chapter
ii
how
i
quit
this
took
some
time
i
did
dash
into
it
i
had
done
that
before
and
had
dashed
out
again
just
as
impetuously
i
revolved
the
matter
in
my
mind
for
some
weeks
then
i
decided
to
quit
then
i
did
quit
thereby
hangs
this
tale
i
went
to
a
dinner
one
night
that
was
a
good
dinner
it
was
a
dinner
that
had
every
appurtenance
that
a
good
dinner
should
have
including
the
best
things
to
drink
that
could
be
obtained
and
lashings
of
them
i
proceeded
at
that
dinner
just
as
i
had
proceeded
at
scores
of
similar
dinners
in
my
time
hundreds
of
them
i
guess
and
took
a
drink
every
time
anybody
else
did
i
was
a
seasoned
drinker
i
knew
how
to
do
it
i
went
home
that
night
pleasantly
jingled
but
no
more
i
slept
well
ate
a
good
breakfast
and
went
down
to
business
on
the
way
down
i
decided
that
this
was
the
day
to
make
the
plunge
having
arrived
at
that
decision
i
went
out
about
three
that
afternoon
drank
a
scotch
highball
a
big
one
as
a
and
quit
that
was
almost
a
year
ago
i
have
taken
a
drink
since
it
is
not
my
present
intention
ever
to
take
another
drink
but
i
am
not
tying
myself
down
by
any
vows
it
is
not
my
present
intention
i
say
and
i
let
it
go
at
that
no
man
can
be
blamed
for
trying
to
fool
other
people
about
himself
that
is
the
way
most
of
us
get
past
but
what
can
be
said
for
a
man
who
tries
to
fool
himself
every
man
knows
exactly
how
bogus
he
is
and
should
admit
it
to
himself
only
the
man
who
knowing
his
bogusness
refuses
to
admit
it
to
himself
no
matter
what
his
attitude
may
be
to
the
outside
world
simply
stores
up
trouble
for
himself
and
discomfort
and
much
else
there
are
many
phases
of
personal
understanding
of
oneself
that
need
not
be
put
in
the
newspapers
or
proclaimed
publicly
still
for
a
man
to
himself
is
a
profitless
undertaking
but
prevalent
notwithstanding
when
it
comes
to
fooling
oneself
by
oneself
the
grandest
performers
are
the
boys
who
have
a
habit
no
matter
what
kind
of
a
habit
a
habit
it
may
be
smoking
cigarettes
or
walking
pigeontoed
or
talking
through
the
nose
or
drinking
or
anything
else
any
man
can
see
with
half
an
eye
how
drinking
for
example
is
hurting
jones
but
he
always
argues
that
his
own
personal
drinking
is
of
a
different
variety
and
is
doing
him
no
harm
the
best
illustration
of
it
is
in
the
old
vaudeville
story
where
the
man
came
on
the
stage
and
said
smith
is
drinking
too
much
i
never
go
into
a
saloon
without
finding
him
there
that
is
the
reason
drinking
liquor
gets
so
many
people
either
by
wrecking
their
health
or
by
fastening
on
them
the
habit
they
can
not
stop
they
fool
themselves
they
are
perfectly
well
aware
that
their
neighbors
are
drinking
too
much
but
not
themselves
far
be
it
from
them
not
to
have
the
to
stop
when
it
is
time
to
stop
they
are
smarter
than
their
neighbors
they
know
what
they
are
doing
and
suddenly
the
explosions
come
there
are
hundreds
of
thousands
of
men
in
all
walks
of
life
in
this
country
who
for
twenty
or
thirty
years
have
never
lived
a
minute
when
there
was
not
more
or
less
alcohol
in
their
systems
who
can
not
be
said
to
have
been
strictly
and
entirely
sober
in
all
that
time
but
who
do
their
work
perform
all
their
social
duties
make
their
careers
and
are
fairly
successful
just
the
same
there
has
been
more
printed
and
spoken
about
drinking
liquor
than
about
any
other
employment
avocation
vocation
habit
practice
or
pleasure
of
mankind
drinking
liquor
is
a
personal
proposition
and
nothing
else
it
is
individual
in
every
human
relation
still
you
can
not
make
the
reformers
see
that
they
want
other
people
to
stop
drinking
because
they
want
other
people
to
stop
so
they
make
laws
that
are
violated
and
get
pledges
that
are
broken
and
try
to
legislate
or
preach
or
coax
or
scare
away
a
habit
that
must
in
any
successful
outcome
be
stopped
by
the
individual
and
not
because
of
any
law
or
threat
or
terror
or
cajolery
this
is
the
side
of
it
but
the
professional
reformers
know
less
about
human
nature
and
care
less
than
about
any
other
phase
of
life
still
the
fact
remains
that
with
any
habit
and
especially
with
the
liquor
habit
probably
because
that
is
the
most
prevalent
habit
there
is
of
the
subjects
delude
themselves
about
how
much
of
a
habit
they
have
and
second
that
of
those
with
the
habit
have
a
very
clear
idea
of
the
extent
to
which
the
habit
is
fastened
on
others
they
are
fooled
about
themselves
but
never
about
their
neighbors
wherefore
the
breweries
and
the
distilleries
prosper
exceedingly
however
i
am
straying
away
from
my
story
which
has
to
do
with
such
drinking
as
the
ordinary
man
does
not
sprees
nor
debauches
or
orgies
or
periodicals
or
drunkenness
but
just
the
ordinary
amount
of
drinking
that
happens
along
in
a
man
life
with
a
little
too
much
on
rare
occasions
and
plenty
at
all
times
a
german
i
knew
once
told
me
the
difference
between
drinking
and
american
drinking
was
that
the
german
for
example
drinks
for
the
pleasure
of
the
drink
while
the
american
drinks
for
the
alcohol
in
it
that
may
be
so
but
very
few
men
who
have
any
sense
or
any
age
set
out
deliberately
to
get
drunk
such
drunkenness
as
there
is
among
men
of
that
sort
usually
comes
more
by
accident
than
by
design
my
definition
of
a
drunkard
has
always
been
this
a
man
is
a
drunkard
when
he
drinks
whisky
or
any
other
liquor
before
breakfast
i
think
that
is
pretty
nearly
right
personally
i
never
took
a
drink
of
liquor
before
breakfast
in
my
life
and
not
many
before
noon
usually
my
drinking
began
in
the
afternoon
after
business
and
was
likely
to
end
before
dinnertime
not
always
but
usually
chapter
iii
what
i
quit
i
had
been
drinking
thus
for
practically
twenty
years
i
did
not
drink
at
all
until
after
i
was
and
not
much
until
after
i
was
when
i
got
to
be
or
and
had
gone
along
a
little
in
the
world
i
fell
in
with
men
of
my
own
station
and
as
i
lived
in
a
town
where
nearly
everybody
drank
including
many
of
the
successful
business
and
professional
men
men
of
affairs
i
soon
got
into
their
habits
naturally
gregarious
i
found
these
men
good
company
they
were
sociable
and
convivial
and
drank
for
the
fun
of
it
and
the
fun
that
came
out
of
it
my
business
took
me
to
various
parts
of
the
country
and
i
made
acquaintances
among
men
like
these
the
real
live
ones
in
the
communities
they
were
good
fellows
so
was
i
the
result
was
that
in
a
few
years
i
had
a
list
of
friends
from
california
to
maine
all
of
whom
drank
and
i
was
never
at
a
loss
for
company
or
highballs
then
i
moved
to
a
city
where
there
is
much
of
anything
else
to
do
but
drink
at
certain
times
in
the
day
a
city
where
men
from
all
parts
of
the
country
congregate
and
where
the
social
side
of
life
is
highly
accentuated
i
kept
along
with
the
procession
i
did
my
work
satisfactorily
to
my
employers
and
i
did
my
drinking
satisfactorily
to
myself
this
continued
for
several
years
i
had
a
fixed
habit
i
drank
several
drinks
each
day
sometimes
i
drank
more
than
several
my
system
was
organized
to
digest
about
so
much
alcohol
every
hours
so
far
as
i
could
see
the
drinking
did
me
no
harm
i
was
well
my
appetite
was
good
i
slept
soundly
my
head
was
clear
my
work
proceeded
easily
and
was
getting
fair
recognition
then
some
of
the
boys
began
dropping
off
and
some
began
breaking
down
i
had
occasional
mornings
after
big
dinners
or
specially
convivial
affairs
when
i
did
not
feel
very
well
when
i
was
out
of
tune
and
knew
why
still
i
continued
as
of
old
and
thought
nothing
of
it
except
as
the
regular
katzenjammer
to
be
expected
presently
i
woke
up
to
what
was
happening
round
me
i
looked
the
game
over
critically
i
analyzed
it
coldly
and
calmly
i
put
every
advantage
of
my
mode
of
life
on
one
side
and
every
disadvantage
and
i
put
on
the
other
side
every
disadvantage
of
a
change
in
procedure
and
every
advantage
there
were
times
when
i
thought
the
present
mode
had
by
far
the
better
of
it
and
times
when
the
change
contemplated
outweighed
the
other
heavily
here
is
the
way
it
totted
up
against
quitting
practically
every
friend
you
have
in
the
united
states
and
you
got
a
lot
of
them
drinks
more
or
less
you
have
not
cultivated
any
other
line
of
associates
if
you
quit
drinking
you
will
necessarily
have
to
quit
a
lot
of
these
friends
and
quit
their
parties
and
company
for
a
man
who
drink
is
always
a
at
a
feast
or
merrymaking
where
drinking
is
going
on
your
social
intercourse
with
these
people
is
predicated
on
taking
an
occasional
drink
in
going
to
places
where
drinks
are
served
both
public
and
at
homes
the
kind
of
drinking
you
do
makes
greatly
for
sociability
and
you
are
a
sociable
person
and
like
to
be
round
with
congenial
people
you
will
miss
a
lot
of
fun
a
lot
of
good
clever
companionship
for
you
are
too
old
to
form
a
new
line
of
friends
your
whole
game
is
organized
along
these
lines
why
make
a
hermit
of
yourself
just
because
you
think
drinking
may
harm
you
cut
it
down
take
care
of
yourself
do
be
such
a
fool
as
to
try
to
change
your
manner
of
living
just
when
you
have
an
opportunity
to
live
as
you
should
and
enjoy
what
is
coming
to
you
this
is
the
way
it
lined
up
for
quitting
so
far
liquor
has
done
anything
to
you
except
cause
you
to
waste
some
time
that
might
have
been
otherwise
employed
but
it
will
get
you
just
as
it
has
landed
a
lot
of
your
friends
if
you
stay
by
it
would
it
be
better
to
miss
some
of
this
stuff
you
have
come
to
think
of
as
fun
and
live
longer
there
is
no
novelty
in
drinking
to
you
you
have
an
appetite
that
can
not
be
checked
but
you
will
have
if
you
stick
to
it
much
longer
why
not
quit
and
take
a
chance
at
a
new
mode
of
living
especially
when
you
know
absolutely
that
every
health
reason
every
reason
every
atom
of
good
sense
in
you
tells
you
there
is
nothing
to
be
gained
by
keeping
at
it
and
that
all
may
be
lost
well
i
pondered
over
that
a
long
time
i
had
watched
miserable
wretches
who
had
struggled
to
stay
on
the
waterwagon
sometimes
with
amusement
i
knew
what
they
had
to
stand
if
they
tried
to
associate
with
their
former
companions
i
knew
the
apparent
difficulties
and
the
disadvantages
of
this
new
mode
of
life
on
the
other
hand
i
was
convinced
that
so
far
as
i
was
concerned
without
trying
to
lay
down
a
rule
for
any
other
man
i
would
be
an
ass
if
i
did
quit
it
immediately
while
i
was
well
and
all
right
instead
of
waiting
until
i
had
to
quit
on
a
doctor
orders
or
got
to
that
stage
when
i
quit
it
was
no
easy
thing
to
make
the
decision
it
is
hard
to
change
the
habits
and
associations
of
twenty
years
i
had
a
good
understanding
of
myself
i
was
no
hero
i
liked
the
fun
of
it
the
companionship
of
it
better
than
any
one
i
like
my
friends
and
i
hope
and
think
they
like
me
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
needed
it
in
my
business
for
i
was
always
dealing
with
men
who
did
drink
i
wrestled
with
it
for
some
weeks
i
thought
it
all
out
up
one
side
and
down
the
other
then
i
quit
also
i
stayed
quit
and
believe
me
ladies
and
gentlemen
and
all
others
present
it
was
no
fool
of
a
job
i
have
learned
many
things
since
i
went
on
the
waterwagon
for
fair
many
things
about
my
fellowmen
and
many
things
about
myself
most
of
these
things
radiate
round
the
innate
hypocrisy
of
the
human
being
all
those
that
do
not
concern
his
hypocrisy
concern
his
lying
which
i
reckon
when
you
come
to
stack
them
up
together
amounts
to
the
same
thing
i
have
learned
that
i
had
been
fooling
myself
and
that
others
had
been
fooling
me
i
gathered
experience
every
day
and
some
of
the
things
i
have
learned
i
shall
set
down
you
have
all
known
the
man
who
says
he
quit
drinking
and
never
thought
of
drink
again
he
is
a
liar
he
does
exist
no
man
in
this
world
who
had
a
daily
habit
of
drinking
ever
quit
and
never
thought
of
drinking
again
many
men
because
they
habitually
lie
to
themselves
think
they
have
done
this
but
they
have
the
fact
is
no
man
with
a
daily
habit
of
drinking
ever
quit
and
thought
of
anything
else
than
how
good
a
drink
would
taste
and
feel
for
a
time
after
he
quit
he
and
he
did
i
do
care
what
any
of
them
say
i
know
further
the
man
who
tells
you
he
never
takes
a
drink
until
five
in
the
afternoon
or
three
in
the
afternoon
or
only
drinks
with
his
meals
or
only
takes
two
or
three
drinks
a
day
usually
is
a
liar
too
not
always
but
usually
there
are
some
persons
who
can
do
this
drink
by
rote
or
by
rule
but
not
many
now
i
do
not
say
many
men
do
not
think
they
drink
this
way
but
most
of
these
men
are
simply
fooling
themselves
again
this
proposition
of
cutting
down
drinks
to
two
or
three
a
day
is
all
rot
of
what
use
to
any
person
are
two
or
three
drinks
a
day
i
mean
to
any
person
who
drinks
for
the
fun
of
it
as
i
did
and
as
most
of
my
friends
do
yet
what
kind
of
a
human
being
is
he
who
comes
into
a
club
and
takes
one
cocktail
and
no
more
or
one
highball
he
worse
from
any
of
sociability
than
a
man
who
drinks
a
glass
of
water
at
least
the
man
who
drinks
the
water
is
fooling
himself
or
trying
to
be
part
one
thing
and
part
another
the
way
to
quit
drinking
is
to
quit
drinking
that
is
all
there
is
to
that
this
paltering
along
with
two
or
three
drinks
a
day
is
mere
cowardice
it
is
neither
one
thing
nor
the
other
and
i
am
here
to
say
also
that
nine
out
of
every
ten
men
who
say
they
only
take
two
or
three
drinks
a
day
are
liars
just
the
same
as
the
men
who
say
they
quit
and
never
think
of
it
again
they
may
not
think
they
are
liars
or
intend
to
be
liars
but
they
are
liars
just
the
same
well
as
i
may
have
intimated
i
quit
drinking
i
drank
that
last
lingering
scotch
highball
and
quit
i
decided
the
end
of
it
was
the
better
end
and
i
took
that
end
chapter
iv
when
i
quit
for
purposes
of
comprehensive
record
i
have
divided
the
various
stages
of
my
waterwagoning
into
these
parts
the
obsession
stage
the
caramel
stage
the
pharisaical
stage
and
the
stage
i
drank
my
scotch
highball
and
went
over
to
the
club
the
crowd
was
there
i
sat
down
at
a
table
and
when
somebody
asked
me
what
i
have
i
took
a
glass
of
water
several
of
my
friends
looked
inquiringly
at
me
and
one
asked
on
the
wagon
this
attracted
the
attention
of
the
entire
group
to
my
glass
of
water
i
came
in
for
a
good
deal
of
banter
mostly
along
the
line
that
it
was
time
i
went
on
the
wagon
this
was
varied
with
predictions
that
i
would
stay
on
from
an
hour
to
a
day
or
so
i
like
that
talk
but
i
bluffed
it
out
weakly
to
be
sure
i
said
i
had
decided
it
would
do
me
any
harm
to
cool
out
a
bit
next
day
along
about
time
i
felt
a
craving
for
a
highball
i
did
take
it
that
evening
i
went
over
to
the
club
again
the
crowd
was
there
i
was
asked
to
have
a
drink
this
time
i
rather
defiantly
ordered
a
glass
of
water
the
same
jests
were
made
but
i
drank
my
water
on
the
third
day
i
was
a
bit
shaky
sort
of
nervous
i
did
feel
like
work
i
could
concentrate
my
mind
on
anything
i
kept
thinking
of
various
kinds
of
drinks
and
how
good
they
would
taste
i
tried
out
the
club
i
may
have
imagined
it
but
i
thought
my
old
friends
lacked
interest
in
my
advent
at
the
table
one
of
them
said
oh
for
heaven
sake
take
a
drink
you
got
a
terrible
grouch
on
i
backed
out
i
did
have
a
grouch
i
was
sore
at
everybody
in
the
world
also
i
kept
thinking
how
much
i
would
like
to
have
a
drink
that
was
natural
i
had
accustomed
my
system
to
digest
a
certain
amount
of
alcohol
every
day
i
was
supplying
that
alcohol
my
system
needed
it
and
howled
for
it
i
knew
a
man
who
had
been
a
drunkard
but
who
had
quit
and
who
taken
a
drink
for
twelve
years
i
discussed
the
problem
with
him
he
told
me
an
eminent
specialist
had
told
him
it
takes
eighteen
months
for
a
man
who
has
been
a
heavy
drinker
or
a
steady
drinker
to
get
all
the
alcohol
out
of
his
system
i
had
been
a
heavy
drinker
but
i
had
been
a
steady
drinker
and
that
information
gave
me
a
cold
chill
i
thought
if
i
were
to
have
this
craving
for
a
drink
every
day
for
eighteen
months
surely
i
had
let
myself
in
for
a
lovely
task
i
stuck
for
a
week
for
two
weeks
for
three
weeks
at
the
end
of
that
time
my
friends
had
grown
accustomed
to
this
idiosyncrasy
and
were
making
bets
on
how
long
i
would
last
i
did
go
round
where
they
were
much
i
was
as
lonesome
as
a
stray
dog
in
a
strange
alley
i
had
carefully
cultivated
a
large
line
of
drinking
acquaintances
and
i
hardly
knew
a
congenial
person
who
did
drink
that
was
the
hardest
part
of
the
game
i
was
fit
company
for
man
or
beast
i
do
blame
my
friends
not
a
bit
i
was
cross
and
ugly
and
hypercritical
and
generally
nasty
and
they
passed
me
up
however
the
craving
for
liquor
decreased
to
some
degree
there
were
some
periods
in
the
day
when
i
did
think
how
good
a
drink
would
taste
and
did
devote
myself
to
my
work
i
discovered
a
few
things
one
was
that
no
matter
how
much
fun
i
missed
in
the
evening
i
did
get
up
with
a
taste
in
my
mouth
i
had
no
katzenjammers
after
a
week
or
so
i
went
to
sleep
easily
and
slept
like
a
child
then
the
caramel
stage
arrived
i
acquired
a
sudden
craving
for
candy
i
had
not
eaten
any
candy
for
years
for
men
who
drink
regularly
rarely
take
sweets
one
day
i
looked
in
a
confectioner
window
and
was
irresistibly
attracted
by
a
box
of
caramels
i
went
in
and
bought
it
and
ate
half
a
dozen
they
seemed
to
fill
a
want
the
sugar
in
them
supplied
the
stimulant
that
was
lacking
i
suppose
anyhow
they
tasted
right
good
and
were
satisfactory
and
i
kept
a
box
of
caramels
on
my
desk
for
several
weeks
and
ate
a
few
each
day
also
i
began
to
yell
for
ice
cream
and
pie
and
other
sweets
with
my
meals
along
about
this
time
i
developed
the
pharisaical
stage
i
looked
with
a
great
pity
on
my
friends
who
persisted
in
drinking
i
assumed
some
little
airs
of
superiority
and
congratulated
myself
on
my
great
that
had
enabled
me
to
quit
drinking
they
were
steadily
drinking
themselves
to
death
i
could
see
that
plainly
there
was
nothing
else
to
it
i
was
a
fine
sample
of
a
prig
i
went
so
far
as
to
explain
the
case
to
one
or
two
and
i
got
hooted
at
for
my
pains
so
i
lapsed
into
my
condition
of
immense
superiority
and
said
oh
well
if
they
wo
take
advice
from
me
who
knows
let
them
go
along
poor
chaps
i
am
afraid
they
are
lost
it
a
wonder
somebody
did
take
an
ax
to
me
i
deserved
it
after
lamenting
to
myself
the
sad
fates
of
my
former
companions
and
pluming
myself
on
my
noble
course
i
woke
up
one
day
and
kicked
myself
round
the
park
here
i
said
you
chump
what
business
have
you
got
putting
on
airs
about
your
and
parading
yourself
round
here
as
a
giant
example
of
where
do
you
get
off
as
a
preacher
or
a
censor
or
a
reformer
in
this
matter
who
appointed
you
as
the
apostle
of
take
a
tumble
to
yourself
and
close
up
that
was
the
beginning
of
the
stage
which
still
persists
it
came
about
the
end
of
the
second
month
i
had
lost
all
desire
for
liquor
and
though
there
were
times
when
i
missed
the
sociability
of
drinking
fearfully
i
was
as
steady
as
a
rock
in
my
policy
of
abstaining
from
drinks
of
all
kinds
now
it
does
bother
me
at
all
i
am
riding
jauntily
on
the
wagon
without
a
chance
of
falling
off
at
the
time
i
decided
it
was
up
to
me
to
stop
this
pharisaical
foolishness
i
took
a
new
view
of
things
decided
i
was
so
much
after
all
ceased
reprobating
my
friends
who
wanted
to
drink
had
no
advice
to
offer
and
stopped
pointing
to
myself
as
a
heroic
young
person
who
had
accomplished
a
gigantic
task
friends
had
tolerated
me
i
wondered
that
they
had
for
i
was
a
sad
affair
surely
it
was
up
to
me
to
be
as
tolerant
as
they
had
been
notwithstanding
my
new
mode
of
life
so
i
stopped
foreboding
and
tried
to
accustom
my
friends
to
my
company
on
a
strictly
water
basis
the
attempt
was
not
entirely
successful
i
dropped
out
of
a
good
many
gatherings
where
formerly
i
should
have
been
one
of
the
bright
and
shining
lights
there
are
no
two
ways
about
it
a
man
can
not
drink
water
in
a
company
where
others
are
drinking
highballs
and
get
into
the
game
with
any
effectiveness
any
person
who
quits
drinking
may
as
well
accept
that
as
a
fact
and
most
persons
will
stop
trying
after
a
time
and
seek
new
diversions
or
begin
drinking
again
chapter
v
after
i
quit
i
had
a
good
lively
tilt
with
john
barleycorn
ranging
over
twenty
years
i
know
all
about
drinking
i
figured
it
this
way
i
have
about
fifteen
more
good
productive
years
in
me
after
that
i
shall
lose
in
efficiency
even
if
i
keep
my
health
being
selfish
and
perhaps
getting
sensible
i
desire
the
remaining
productive
years
of
my
life
to
be
years
of
the
greatest
efficiency
looking
back
over
my
drinking
years
i
saw
if
i
was
to
attain
and
keep
that
greatest
efficiency
that
was
my
job
and
that
it
could
not
be
complicated
with
any
whatsoever
i
decided
that
what
i
might
lose
in
the
companionship
and
social
end
of
it
i
would
gain
in
my
own
personal
increase
in
horsepower
for
i
knew
that
though
drinking
may
have
done
me
no
harm
it
certainly
did
me
no
good
and
that
if
persisted
in
it
surely
would
do
me
harm
in
some
way
or
other
sizing
it
up
one
side
against
the
other
i
conclude
that
it
is
better
for
me
not
to
drink
i
find
i
have
much
more
time
that
i
can
devote
to
my
business
that
i
think
more
clearly
feel
better
do
not

constantly
the
item
of
time
is
the
surprising
item
it
is
astonishing
how
much
time
you
have
to
do
things
in
that
formerly
you
used
to
drink
in
with
the
accompaniment
of
all
the
piffle
that
goes
with
drinking
when
you
are
drinking
you
are
never
too
busy
to
take
a
drink
and
never
too
busy
not
to
stop
you
are
busy
all
the
time
but
get
nowhere
work
is
the
curse
of
the
drinking
classes
any
man
who
has
been
accustomed
to
do
the
kind
of
drinking
i
did
for
twenty
years
who
likes
the
sociability
and
the
companionship
of
it
will
find
that
the
sudden
transition
to
a
life
will
leave
him
with
a
pretty
dull
existence
on
his
hands
until
he
gets
reorganized
this
is
the
depressing
part
of
it
you
have
nowhere
to
go
and
nothing
to
do
still
though
you
may
miss
the
fun
of
the
evening
you
have
all
your
drinking
friends
