the
legal
status
of
the
negro
in
the
united
states
is
difficult
to
define
or
describe
because
on
paper
he
is
an
american
citizen
entitled
to
the
rights
of
an
american
citizen
but
in
practice
he
does
not
get
what
he
is
entitled
to
or
anything
like
it
in
certain
parts
of
the
republic
his
life
is
by
written
law
and
so
is
his
liberty
and
his
activities
in
pursuit
of
happiness
and
to
better
his
condition
moreover
in
order
that
he
may
protect
himself
against
the
predatory
aggression
and
greed
of
other
citizens
he
is
invested
by
the
supreme
law
of
the
land
with
the
right
to
vote
with
a
voice
in
the
government
to
enable
him
to
defend
himself
against
the
enactment
of
bad
and
unequal
laws
and
against
their
bad
and
unequal
administration
certainly
the
negro
seems
to
be
the
equal
in
rights
of
any
other
american
that
he
is
on
paper
there
is
not
a
doubt
but
that
he
is
not
in
reality
there
is
not
a
doubt
either
what
he
is
entitled
to
does
not
anywhere
in
the
south
and
in
some
states
of
the
north
square
itself
with
what
he
actually
enjoys
there
is
an
enormous
discrepancy
in
his
case
between
national
promise
or
guarantees
and
national
performance
or
possessions
he
is
an
american
citizen
under
the
national
constitution
to
be
sure
he
is
but
with
a
big
qualification
he
has
the
right
to
reach
up
and
out
and
to
grow
in
every
direction
like
other
american
citizens
whose
race
and
color
are
different
from
his
own
not
a
doubt
of
it
in
legal
theory
but
when
he
puts
his
theoretical
rights
to
the
test
of
fact
he
finds
that
he
is
different
that
he
may
not
do
many
of
the
things
which
white
men
all
about
him
are
doing
all
the
time
he
finds
that
even
the
chinese
who
are
denied
citizenship
in
the
republic
receive
better
treatment
are
accorded
larger
liberties
as
men
than
are
allowed
him
in
the
south
why
is
this
why
does
the
negro
occupy
this
very
anomalous
position
in
his
country
is
it
because
he
is
an
alien
it
can
not
really
be
that
because
he
is
not
an
alien
but
perhaps
it
is
because
the
whites
choose
to
make
believe
that
he
is
an
alien
which
comes
nearer
the
real
reason
nevertheless
no
alien
is
he
any
more
than
are
the
whites
themselves
if
duration
of
occupancy
of
the
soil
has
anything
to
do
with
making
a
race
native
and
to
the
manner
born
is
it
because
the
negro
has
proved
himself
an
undesirable
citizen
certainly
not
if
past
services
to
the
country
of
the
greatest
value
are
any
proof
to
the
contrary
in
the
revolutionary
war
he
was
no
insignificant
factor
in
achieving
american
independence
and
in
the
war
of
which
defended
this
independence
against
british
aggression
and
in
the
civil
war
which
saved
the
union
and
abolished
slavery
and
in
the
war
which
removed
a
chronic
peril
to
the
national
peace
and
added
immensely
to
the
national
domain
nor
has
he
failed
as
a
laborer
for
he
does
annually
his
share
of
the
work
of
the
nation
and
in
the
production
of
its
wealth
without
negro
labor
how
much
less
cotton
would
the
south
produce
annually
or
sugar
or
rice
or
tobacco
think
you
his
labor
besides
is
very
much
in
evidence
in
southern
mines
and
mills
and
trades
then
has
he
ever
plotted
against
the
government
state
or
national
was
he
ever
as
a
class
a
menace
to
law
and
order
or
an
enemy
to
property
or
a
breeder
of
industrial
unrest
and
violence
on
the
contrary
has
he
not
been
patient
and
peaceful
and
cheerful
under
wrongs
which
would
have
made
any
other
class
of
americans
sullen
and
dangerous
and
lawless
no
he
is
not
an
undesirable
citizen
for
these
sufficient
reasons
but
there
is
yet
another
good
answer
on
this
head
negro
labor
could
not
in
any
considerable
numbers
leave
the
south
voluntarily
because
southern
capital
and
landed
interests
would
not
let
it
would
resist
by
force
if
found
necessary
its
migration
to
other
parts
this
sounds
singular
in
this
land
of
the
free
and
it
is
singular
for
of
no
other
class
of
american
labor
could
it
be
said
that
its
right
to
migrate
from
one
state
to
another
is
actually
obstructed
by
law
and
would
be
resisted
by
force
it
is
singular
but
it
is
nevertheless
true
if
a
thousand
or
ten
thousand
or
a
hundred
thousand
agricultural
laborers
in
the
west
were
to
make
up
their
minds
to
move
to
the
cotton
belt
of
the
south
they
would
be
free
to
do
so
regardless
of
the
injury
which
western
farmers
might
suffer
in
consequence
of
their
migration
but
if
one
hundred
thousand
or
ten
thousand
or
even
one
thousand
negro
cotton
pickers
desired
to
quit
picking
cotton
and
to
seek
their
fortune
in
other
states
does
anyone
imagine
that
they
would
be
allowed
to
depart
in
peace
that
they
would
not
find
rather
by
violent
experience
that
they
are
not
at
liberty
to
make
the
change
the
south
does
not
regard
the
negro
laborer
then
as
undesirable
but
quite
the
contrary
only
it
wants
to
retain
possession
of
it
on
its
own
terms
not
on
those
advantageous
to
that
labor
as
an
american
citizen
then
the
negro
has
a
paper
right
to
move
freely
from
one
place
to
another
but
in
the
south
were
he
to
attempt
to
realize
on
this
right
he
would
in
all
probability
find
himself
realizing
on
a
totally
different
proposition
maybe
the
chain
gang
at
the
hands
of
a
prejudiced
court
on
some
trumped
up
charge
of
an
employer
or
death
at
the
hands
of
a
mob
this
sounds
amazing
and
it
is
amazing
because
it
fits
the
negro
case
so
exactly
because
it
is
an
accurate
description
of
his
condition
as
an
agricultural
laborer
in
many
of
the
southern
states
on
every
hand
over
against
his
paper
rights
as
a
citizen
the
negro
faces
facts
which
make
his
citizenship
seem
like
a
snare
and
a
delusion
let
us
suppose
that
a
member
of
the
american
negro
academy
wishes
with
wife
or
daughter
to
visit
florida
for
his
health
he
can
not
make
the
journey
there
like
a
white
man
whether
citizen
or
foreigner
or
like
any
other
traveller
to
that
section
whatever
his
race
since
he
be
not
a
negro
and
it
makes
no
difference
how
refined
or
educated
or
wealthy
or
infirm
or
aged
a
colored
passenger
may
be
whether
man
woman
or
child
he
encounters
the
same
unjust
and
unequal
treatment
at
the
hands
of
the
railroads
what
though
he
has
paid
for
himself
and
wife
or
daughter
the
same
fare
which
passengers
of
the
favored
class
pay
he
finds
that
there
is
a
vast
difference
between
what
he
gets
and
what
they
get
for
precisely
the
same
money
they
get
always
the
best
accommodations
for
themselves
and
families
while
he
gets
the
worst
there
is
not
a
restaurant
along
the
route
where
he
may
get
a
meal
and
not
a
hotel
which
would
give
him
a
bed
over
night
if
he
can
afford
it
he
may
procure
a
seat
in
a
pullman
and
then
again
he
may
not
be
able
to
do
so
and
in
this
case
as
in
the
event
of
his
not
being
able
to
afford
to
buy
a
seat
in
a
pullman
he
must
make
the
journey
in
a
jim
crow
car
without
separate
toilet
arrangements
for
the
sexes
deficient
in
soap
and
towels
in
water
and
in
general
and
particular
cleanliness
exposed
constantly
to
the
intrusions
and
the
fumes
alcoholic
and
tobacco
of
white
men
passing
to
and
from
their
smoker
which
is
of
the
jim
crow
coach
and
divided
from
it
only
by
an
inadequate
partition
the
colored
passenger
is
to
be
sure
an
american
citizen
on
paper
but
what
is
it
worth
to
him
under
the
circumstances
can
it
compel
railroads
to
furnish
him
decent
accommodations
which
federal
law
provides
shall
be
equal
to
those
furnished
to
white
passengers
and
for
which
the
colored
passenger
pays
the
same
fare
as
the
white
one
it
is
notorious
that
the
accommodations
furnished
by
the
railroads
in
interstate
commerce
to
their
colored
passengers
are
inferior
to
those
which
they
furnish
white
passengers
for
the
same
fare
the
interstate
commerce
commission
knows
this
and
knows
it
well
yet
it
makes
no
determined
and
persistent
attempt
to
compel
railroads
to
give
to
their
colored
passengers
accommodations
equal
to
those
which
they
furnish
their
white
ones
it
is
too
busy
attending
to
the
more
important
business
relating
to
the
property
rights
and
interests
of
shippers
and
capitalists
to
spare
the
time
to
break
up
an
evil
which
makes
the
existence
of
colored
interstate
passengers
an
unbroken
experience
of
bitter
hardships
and
humiliations
surely
there
are
american
citizens
and
american
citizens
citizens
whom
government
protects
and
enables
to
make
good
their
claim
to
equality
before
the
law
and
other
citizens
whom
government
does
not
protect
or
enable
to
make
good
their
claim
to
equality
before
the
law
and
to
this
latter
class
belongs
the
negro
nearly
every
time
and
almost
everywhere
the
negro
is
the
great
american
anomaly
judged
by
his
rights
on
paper
his
citizenship
is
indisputable
but
judged
by
his
rights
in
fact
it
is
full
of
mutilations
and
amputations
which
disfigure
it
almost
beyond
recognition
of
it
appears
in
the
light
clothed
with
fragments
of
his
rights
and
the
other
half
is
in
eclipse
exposed
naked
to
biting
cold
and
bitter
wrong
he
appeals
to
good
men
and
true
in
the
south
and
in
the
north
and
in
the
government
too
to
give
him
what
he
is
entitled
to
he
does
not
get
it
or
anything
like
it
there
does
not
appear
to
be
common
honesty
and
decency
enough
in
the
railroads
to
give
him
what
he
pays
for
as
an
interstate
traveller
human
compassion
to
say
nothing
of
common
justice
enough
in
the
interstate
commerce
commission
to
enforce
against
the
railroads
the
law
made
by
the
government
to
conciliate
the
race
prejudice
of
the
south
the
separate
car
feature
of
the
railroad
rate
bill
was
inserted
in
deference
to
the
demand
of
the
south
and
the
equal
accommodation
feature
as
an
act
of
plain
commercial
justice
to
the
negro
the
south
has
never
failed
to
get
its
separate
cars
while
the
negro
has
never
failed
either
to
receive
the
most
unequal
accommodations
in
open
violation
of
the
provisions
of
that
bill
but
this
is
not
all
or
anything
like
all
that
mars
almost
beyond
recognition
the
citizenship
of
the
negro
if
one
doubts
this
let
him
go
into
the
south
and
let
him
venture
to
incite
the
negroes
there
to
an
assertion
of
their
rights
freedom
of
the
press
is
theirs
under
the
constitution
does
anyone
suppose
that
they
would
be
allowed
to
say
publicly
what
they
think
about
the
and
undemocratic
way
in
which
they
are
treated
let
them
try
it
and
see
what
will
happen
to
them
that
is
if
they
be
wholly
reckless
of
consequences
freedom
of
the
press
is
another
of
their
rights
one
of
the
boasted
bulwarks
of
the
constitution
does
anyone
suppose
that
they
would
be
allowed
to
write
as
freely
or
anything
like
as
freely
about
white
men
and
women
especially
the
latter
as
white
men
write
about
colored
men
and
women
let
some
colored
editor
make
the
experiment
and
tell
afterward
what
happened
to
him
hot
on
the
heels
of
his
article
he
may
not
be
able
to
enlighten
the
public
but
the
associated
press
dispatch
will
give
the
grim
facts
relating
to
the
end
of
that
editor
who
undertook
to
monkey
with
the
buzz
saw
of
the
freedom
of
the
press
in
a
southern
community
another
of
the
sacred
rights
which
appertain
to
the
negro
american
citizenship
is
the
right
of
public
assembly
to
consider
his
grievances
and
discuss
measures
for
their
redress
well
if
any
group
of
negroes
in
almost
any
part
of
the
south
are
hunting
for
trouble
let
them
get
up
a
public
meeting
for
such
a
purpose
and
give
vent
to
the
righteous
indignation
against
oppressions
which
ought
to
stir
the
blood
of
any
man
who
is
not
a
slave
and
then
watch
results
a
flaming
spirit
will
presently
appear
in
the
midst
of
that
meeting
and
it
will
not
be
the
flaming
spirit
of
liberty
but
of
a
southern
mob
on
arson
and
murder
bent
negro
property
will
be
burned
and
negro
blood
will
be
shed
and
that
without
stint
or
mercy
the
negro
constitutional
right
to
assemble
to
consider
his
wrongs
is
in
reality
too
weak
to
resist
the
murderous
violence
of
a
southern
mob
the
mob
burns
negroes
and
their
property
almost
everywhere
in
the
south
with
absolute
impunity
nothing
is
done
by
the
authorities
to
punish
the
mob
or
to
protect
their
victims
and
yet
both
the
mob
and
its
victims
are
american
citizens
entitled
alike
on
paper
to
the
law
protection
and
amenable
alike
to
its
penalties
the
white
man
enjoys
a
monopoly
of
the
first
and
the
negro
gets
the
share
of
the
second
the
colored
man
who
has
the
temerity
to
agitate
for
his
rights
in
the
south
may
find
himself
agitating
speedily
at
the
end
of
a
rope
unless
he
more
speedily
finds
some
hole
in
the
ground
to
give
him
the
protection
which
government
refuses
him
he
would
in
that
event
be
surer
of
the
thing
which
he
seeks
if
the
hole
in
the
ground
were
a
hole
in
some
grave
yard
for
then
the
hole
might
be
pulled
in
after
him
when
he
would
find
rest
at
last
surcease
from
all
the
cruel
perplexities
and
inequalities
of
his
american
citizenship
again
i
ask
why
is
all
this
thus
it
is
not
because
the
negro
is
an
alien
or
because
he
is
an
undesirable
citizen
for
he
is
not
that
at
all
as
we
have
seen
but
quite
the
contrary
but
how
explain
this
enormous
contradiction
between
the
rights
which
he
is
legally
entitled
to
and
those
which
he
actually
possesses
here
he
is
fifty
years
after
emancipation
years
after
his
investiture
with
american
citizenship
and
years
after
the
adoption
of
the
great
amendment
to
the
constitution
which
gave
him
the
right
to
vote
a
voice
in
making
the
laws
not
more
than
half
free
than
half
a
citizen
in
many
states
of
the
union
why
is
this
so
i
ask
again
is
it
not
because
he
is
the
ballotless
victim
in
those
states
of
governments
in
which
he
is
denied
a
voice
in
governor
john
andrew
foresaw
clearly
what
would
be
the
fate
of
the
negro
in
the
old
slave
states
without
the
ballot
the
condition
which
the
great
war
governor
foresaw
then
fits
remarkably
well
the
negro
actual
condition
in
certain
sections
of
the
nation
meanwhile
he
said
the
disfranchised
freedmen
hated
by
some
because
he
is
black
contemned
by
some
because
he
has
been
a
slave
feared
by
some
because
of
the
antagonisms
of
society
is
condemned
to
the
condition
of
a
hopeless
pariah
of
a
merciless
civilization
in
the
community
he
is
not
of
it
he
neither
belongs
to
a
master
nor
to
society
the
thing
which
john
andrew
foresaw
in
as
likely
to
come
to
pass
in
case
of
disfranchisement
of
the
blacks
has
been
coming
to
pass
ever
since
and
the
cause
which
has
reduced
the
negro
to
his
present
anomalous
position
in
the
republic
of
which
he
is
a
citizen
is
his
lack
of
the
right
to
vote
which
makes
its
possessor
a
part
of
the
community
in
which
he
lives
and
enables
him
to
make
that
community
respond
to
his
needs
as
a
vital
part
of
its
body
social
and
politic
the
negro
in
the
mass
is
a
disfranchised
man
his
political
influence
in
mississippi
louisiana
alabama
georgia
south
carolina
north
carolina
and
virginia
is
practically
at
the
zero
point
the
mass
of
the
disfranchised
in
those
seven
southern

affect
more
or

adversely
the
status
of
the

of

the
disfranchised
negro
operates
in
many
ways
to
depreciate
the
rights
of
the
enfranchised
negro
and
to
draw
him
by
the
invisible
threads
of
race
kinship
and
of
race
prejudice
toward
if
not
quite
within
the
zone
of
his
own
limitations
and
disabilities
a
disfranchised
class
in
an
industrial
republic
like
ours
is
as
much
at
the
mercy
of
an
enfranchised
class
as
is
a
flock
of
shepherdless
sheep
at
the
mercy
of
a
pack
of

the

will
devour
the

the

prey
on

the

be
driven

do
every
time
whether
they

the
shepherd
protects
the
sheep
from
the
depredations
of
the

the

protects
poverty
against

are

fortunate
in

a

governor
andrew
was
right
a
disfranchised
man
a
disfranchised
class
must
become
ultimately
the
hopeless
pariah
of
a
merciless
civilization
this
is
the
peril
the
fate
which
hangs
over
the
colored
race
at
the
close
of
the
first
fifty
years
of
its
emancipation
governor
andrew
scheme
for
the
reconstruction
of
the
rebel
states
included
not
only
the
extension
of
the
suffrage
to
the
blacks
but
the
to
their
full
citizenship
of
the
class
of
old
slaveholders
who
had
carried
those
states
out
of
the
union
they
were
needed
as
leaders
in
the
work
of
restoration
and
reconstruction
he
shrewdly
argued
and
he
was
right
they
were
indeed
the
natural
leaders
of
the
south
and
had
they
turned
their
backs
upon
the
past
and
faced
patriotically
the
new
problems
and
the
new
posture
of
their
affairs
they
might
have
led
both
races
into
the
promised
land
of
freedom
and
peace
and
southern
industrial
expansion
and
greatness
had
they
seized
their
golden
opportunity
for
progressive
and
constructive
statesmanship
the
sceptre
of
their
ascendency
in
the
governments
of
their
section
could
not
have
been
wrested
from
them
by
another
class
of
whites
risen
since
the
war
who
distrust
and
hate
them
but
they
might
instead
have
transmitted
their
ascendency
undiminished
to
their
descendants
who
ought
to
be
today
the
leaders
of
the
new
south
the
course
laid
down
by
governor
andrew
was
not
followed
either
by
the
south
or
by
the
north
the
southern
leaders
taking
advantage
of
the
opportunity
given
them
by
andrew
johnson
reconstructed
their
section
along
the
lines
of
their
old
social
system
reducing
its
changes
to
a
minimum
they
emerged
out
of
their
reconstruction
operation
with
a
negro
serf
system
to
take
the
place
of
their
old
slave
system
the
negro
as
a
serf
was
just
about
as
valuable
as
an
industrial
asset
to
the
great
landlords
and
to
the
small
ones
too
for
that
matter
as
had
been
the
negro
as
a
slave
just
about
as
much
unpaid
and
involuntary
labor
could
be
got
out
of
the
first
as
out
of
the
last
thus
did
the
old
master
class
perform
their
task
without
changing
materially
their
old
social
system
but
they
likewise
issued
from
their
labors
not
less
fortunate
in
another
respect
their
old
political
power
would
not
suffer
any
radical
change
in
consequence
of
the
abolition
of
slavery
either
for
whereas
five
slaves
had
counted
for
them
in
the
ante
bellum
apportionment
of
representatives
as
three
freemen
five
serfs
would
count
in
the
apportionment
as
five
free
men
a
pretty
large
gain
for
the
new
power
over
the
old
one
in
federal
numbers
but
in
achieving
this
double
success
the
old
master
class
overreached
itself
the
return
of
the
south
into
the
newly
restored
union
stronger
as
a
serf
power
than
it
had
been
as
a
slave
power
aroused
the
instant
fear
of
the
north
and
set
congress
in
motion
to
thwart
such
reappearance
of
that
section
into
the
arena
of
national
politics
congress
thereupon
took
upon
itself
the
work
of
southern
reconstruction
the
extreme
gravity
of
the
situation
as
it
affected
the
negro
lay
in
the
political
solidity
of
that
section
with
its
governments
in
which
he
was
denied
a
voice
his
freedom
could
not
long
survive
such
a
combination
of
southern
race
prejudice
and
passion
and
political
power
as
constituted
at
that
time
the
solid
south
and
its
governments
they
were
then
and
they
continue
to
be
the
greatest
obstacle
to
the
freedom
and
advancement
of
the
negro
as
an
american
citizen
they
signalized
their
first
entrance
upon
the
stage
of
national
affairs
by
an
attempt
to
create
a
serf
class
out
of
their
former
slaves
when
i
say
that
they
constitute
the
greatest
obstacle
to
the
freedom
and
advancement
of
the
negro
i
mean
of
course
the
greatest
obstacle
outside
of
the
negro
himself
for
i
take
it
that
no
race
that
possesses
intelligence
industry
and
character
coupled
with
unity
of
purpose
and
action
can
be
kept
forever
out
of
its
rights
and
in
a
backward
state
even
by
the
american
white
people
accomplished
as
they
are
in
this
species
of
national
wickedness
unless
they
intend
to
reverse
the
wheel
of
their
progress
and
to
retrograde
in
free
institutions
and
civilization
against
southern
political
solidity
and
its
governments
congress
directed
its
reconstruction
measures
with
the
dissolution
of
this
solidity
and
the
introduction
of
in
place
of
governments
the
republican
leaders
looked
for
the
passing
of
the
danger
to
northern
sectional
supremacy
and
the
freedom
of
the
negro
the
freedmen
were
utilized
at
this
juncture
to
effect
the
necessary
changes
in
the
southern
situation
which
the
exigency
demanded
he
was
first
raised
to
citizenship
and
when
that
proved
inadequate
to
meet
the
emergency
he
was
invested
with
the
right
to
vote
on
equal
terms
with
the
whites
this
great
constitutional
revolution
in
the
status
of
the
negro
laid
the
basis
for
a
political
revolution
in
the
old
slave
states
also
the
solid
south
was
dissolved
for
the
nonce
and
governments
made
their
upon
the
stage
of
southern
affairs
there
followed
prompt
repeal
of
the
reactionary
legislation
hostile
to
the
negro
which
had
signalized
the
rise
to
power
of
the
solid
south
and
its
governments
the
north
received
its
share
likewise
of
the
gains
incident
to
this
revolution
in
the
increase
of
its
partisan
strength
in
both
branches
of
the
national
legislature
and
which
in
turn
confirmed
its
political
domination
in
the
union
the
changes
wrought
in
the
south
by
the
reconstruction
measures
did
not
last
those
measures
afforded
temporary
relief
and
that
was
all
they
did
not
go
deep
enough
and
besides
the
whites
refused
to
cooperate
with
the
blacks
to
make
them
a
success
they
failed
to
moderate
or
abate
southern
opinions
race
prejudice
and
passions
and
were
therefore
doomed
to
fail
as
an
experiment
in
social
and
political
reconstruction
social
and
political
reconstruction
in
those
states
it
seems
now
must
come
from
within
and
by
voluntary
action
not
from
without
and
by
compulsory
legislation
this
is
true
today
whatever
might
have
been
possible
in
this
regard
immediately
after
the
overthrow
of
the
southern
confederacy
what
was
attempted
then
and
failed
would
certainly
fail
today
if
it
were
possible
to
repeat
the
self
same
experiment
the
repetition
of
such
an
attempt
however
being
wholly
outside
of
the
range
of
the
probable
in
american
politics
makes
all
speculation
as
to
what
might
be
its
fate
therefore
nugatory
after
the
presidential
election
of
the
north
abandoned
its
attempt
to
reconstruct
the
south
and
to
keep
it
reconstructed
according
to
its
standard
of
justice
and
political
proportion
the
stream
of
reaction
against
the
negro
set
in
strongly
from
that
time
and
it
has
gathered
volume
each
succeeding
year
since
the
failure
of
the
old
master
class
to
seize
the
opportunity
which
had
come
to
them
a
second
time
following
the
collapse
of
the
rebellion
for
progressive
and
constructive
leadership
of
their
section
on
the
race
question
was
an
egregious
blunder
they
set
in
motion
instead
the
forces
and
passions
which
have
at
length
wrested
the
ballot
from
the
negro
but
they
themselves
have
not
escaped
the
consequences
of
their
egregious
blunder
for
a
new
class
of
whites
have
in
turn
wrested
from
them
their
leadership
in
southern
affairs
the
black
seeds
of
this
blunder
of
the
old
master
class
to
lead
their
section
in
social
justice
and
progress
the
bitter
years
have
ploughed
deep
into
the
life
of
both
races
from
the
black
seeds
of
their
blunder
black
crops
of
race
hatred
and
crime
and
misery
have
been
reaped
annually
by
the
south
along
with
those
other
crops
of
cotton
and
rice
and
sugar
and
tobacco
and
sent
like
them
to
all
parts
of
the
republic
the
process
of
southern
political
solidification
partially
suspended
for
a
few
years
resumed
promptly
after
all
of
its
natural
functions
and
its
one
party
governments
since
that
time
legislation
hostile
to
the
negro
has
increased
enormously
in
that
section
its
old
reconstructed
state
constitutions
have
been
one
by
one
revised
most
favorably
to
the
whites
and
most
unfavorably
and
unjustly
for
the
blacks
for
what
with
grandfather
and
understanding
clauses
educational
and
property
qualifications
partisan
registration
boards
and
election
supervisors
and
white
primaries
the
great
majority
of
the
colored
people
have
been
excluded
from
the
electorate
from
any
voice
in
the
government
while
the
vote
of
the
small
minority
who
are
included
in
the
electorate
has
been
reduced
to
a
nullity
by
their
exclusion
from
the
white
primaries
the
states
which
have
thus
revised
their
constitutions
have
thereby
effected
the
practical
disfranchisement
of
their
entire
colored
population
while
they
have
done
this
they
have
managed
at
the
same
time
to
leave
the
ballot
in
the
hands
of
every
white
man
under
such
unequal
conditions
the
white
man
is
immune
from
legislation
and
administration
unfriendly
to
his
class
while
the
black
man
is
exposed
to
the
aggressions
of
this
favored
class
either
directly
through
mobs
or
indirectly
through
hostile
legislation
and
administration
which
fix
upon
him
the
brand
of
a
caste
whose
members
have
no
rights
in
southern
society
which
white
men
are
bound
to
respect
such
social
injustice
and
political
inequality
as
exist
between
the
races
in
the
south
are
bad
for
the
whites
as
they
are
bad
for
the
blacks
are
very
bad
for
their
collective
interests
and
for
the
national
interests
of
the
great
industrial
democracy
of
which
they
form
a
part
is
it
astonishing
then
that
under
such
circumstances
there
have
sprung
up
and
flourish
in
the
south
the
peonage
and
convict
lease
systems
the
plantation
lease
and
credit
systems
contract
labor
and
jim
crow
laws
lynching
and
the
inequitable
distribution
of
the
public
school
funds
between
the
races
for
the
southern
white
man
and
he
is
not
different
from
any
other
white
man
or
black
man
either
for
that
matter
who
possesses
irresponsible
power
over
others
regulates
his
conduct
toward
the
negro
in
his
midst
by
the
law
of
might
which
allows
him
with
a
good
conscience
to
do
to
the
negro
whatever
he
wants
to
do
and
to
take
from
him
whatever
he
wants
to
take
whether
life
or
liberty
while
it
forbids
his
victim
to
do
what
he
wants
to
do
or
to
retain
what
belongs
to
him
as
an
american
citizen
whether
it
be
his
life
or
his
liberty
that
is
to
do
so
by
identically
the
same
means
which
white
men
use
to
retain
what
belongs
to
them
under
similar
circumstances
things
would
undoubtedly
be
different
for
the
colored
people
in
those
states
had
they
though
slight
some
positive
and
appreciable
influence
at
the
polls
their
condition
would
not
even
then
be
ideal
far
from
it
but
their
hard
lot
as
men
would
improve
their
worth
as
citizens
their
social
and
industrial
value
to
their
community
state
and
country
would
rise
correspondingly
in
the
scale
of
being
and
character
with
the
increased
freedom
and
security
which
in
consequence
would
come
to
them
as
a
race
legislatures
and
administrative
officers
would
begin
to
make
some
response
to
their
claim
for
social
justice
and
political
rights
and
the
courts
would
begin
also
to
lend
a
more
attentive
ear
to
their
rights
of
person
and
property
the
end
of
all
those
terrible
systems
which
exploit
and
rob
and
oppress
them
and
keep
them
poor
and
ignorant
and
weak
the
sad
victims
of
race
prejudice
and
greed
and
cruelty
would
grow
nearer
to
the
perfect
day
of
the
race
final
deliverance
as
american
citizens
they
would
begin
to
get
for
their
children
more
and
better
schools
and
longer
school
terms
and
for
their
teachers
more
equal
pay
as
compared
with
that
received
by
white
teachers
for
similar
service
such
is
the
deplorable
situation
of
the
negro
in
the
south
at
the
close
of
the
first
fifty
years
of
his
freedom
there
will
be
no
improvement
in
that
situation
to
any
material
extent
until
he
gets
the
ballot
a
voice
in
the
government
of
those
states
he
can
not
obtain
a
voice
in
those
governments
of
and
by
himself
he
must
get
help
from
some
power
outside
of
himself
but
from
whom
and
in
what
direction
ought
he
to
look
for
it
not
certainly
from
the
north
from
the
republican
party
for
they
gave
up
long
ago
trying
to
solve
the
problem
how
to
make
a
vote
in
that
section
count
as
much
as
a
vote
in
the
solid
south
they
will
not
again
enact
a
force
bill
or
attempt
to
do
so
or
anything
like
it
they
have
during
recent
years
made
no
movement
to
execute
that
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
which
provides
for
a
reduction
of
southern
representation
in
the
lower
branch
of
congress
proportioned
to
the
number
of
the
disfranchised
male
population
of
those
states
and
they
have
in
fact
no
disposition
to
do
so
on
the
contrary
is
the
ominous
word
which
now
gags
the
northern
people
and
press
its
pulpit
and
platform
and
hobbles
the
action
of
the
general
government
indeed
the
outgoing
occupant
of
the
white
house
has
carried
the
policy
of
to
extreme
limits
for
he
it
is
who
laid
down
the
rule
at
the
beginning
of
his
administration
and
has
observed
it
strictly
for
four
years
that
it
would
be
unwise
to
make
appointments
of
colored
men
to
federal
office
in
the
south
whenever
the
south
objects
to
such
appointments
in
consequence
of
the
consistent
enforcement
of
this
rule
colored
federal
in
the
south
are
like
angels
visits
to
that
section
few
and
far
between
the
south
as
we
have
seen
has
succeeded
most
thoroughly
in
depriving
the
negro
in
its
midst
of
any
voice
in
its
governments
and
it
has
shut
him
out
of
state
offices
and
now
thanks
to
president
taft
has
at
last
succeeded
in
depriving
him
of
holding
federal
office
in
its
midst
likewise
but
there
yet
remains
to
the
southern
colored
man
a
tattered
and
bedraggled
remnant
of
his
citizenship
in
that
section
if
indeed
even
that
shall
be
left
to
him
four
years
hence
i
refer
to
his
quadrennial
appearance
as
a
delegate
in
republican
national
conventions
where
for
a
brief
hour
he
enjoys
the
spotlight
importance
of
a
political
supernumerary
on
the
party
stage
since
there
has
been
an
increasing
inclination
among
republican
leaders
to
reduce
the
representation
of
the
southern
wing
in
national
conventions
to
a
number
proportioned
to
the
size
of
its
vote
on
election
day
but
the
leaders
have
not
yet
got
their
courage
to
the
sticking
point
to
tackle
this
proposition
perhaps
because
they
have
not
been
willing
to
tackle
the
prior
one
of
a
reduction
of
southern
representation
in
congress
and
perhaps
for
other
good
and
sufficient
considerations
of
an
emergency
character
they
have
allowed
the
matter
to
drift
and
to
let
for
the
time
being
well
enough
alone
but
whatever
has
been
the
motive
of
that
party
for
its
policy
of
inactivity
and
indecision
on
this
question
heretofore
there
are
not
wanting
signs
of
a
change
of
that
policy
presently
into
one
of
activity
and
decision
it
seems
probable
that
reduction
of
representation
of
its
southern
wing
in
its
national
conventions
will
occupy
a
prominent
place
on
the
program
of
republican
reorganization
within
the
next
four
years
that
party
in
a
half
dozen
southern
states
has
been
called
in
derision
by
its
enemies
a
ghost
party
and
a
phantom
party
and
such
it
is
in
reality
it
is
dead
and
i
do
not
believe
that
its
corpse
can
ever
be
galvanized
into
life
again
there
are
decomposing
parts
of
it
known
as
regulars
and
lily
whites
stricken
both
with
the
microbes
of
death
obscenely
alive
with
the
maggots
of
it
is
powerless
to
dissolve
the
solid
south
and
to
restore
to
that
section
in
place
of
governments
it
is
wholly
incapable
of
attracting
southern
whites
in
sufficient
numbers
to
raise
it
to
the
rank
of
a
party
of
opposition
or
to
give
to
it
the
barest
chance
of
achieving
success
at
the
polls
its
very
name
is
a
political
bugaboo
and
makes
it
a
party
impossibility
in
those
states
since
rather
than
utilize
it
as
a
party
of
opposition
the
southern
whites
have
preserved
their
sectional
solidity
and
governments
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
many
of
their
more
enlightened
and
far
seeing
men
have
felt
that
such
a
course
is
bad
for
their
section
as
it
would
be
bad
for
any
group
of
states
north
east
or
west
in
the
union
just
at
this
point
let
me
refer
in
passing
to
sundry
causes
which
are
affecting
adversely
the
negro
status
as
a
citizen
and
are
contributing
by
their
collateral
pressure
to
force
him
into
a
sort
of
political
and
industrial
blind
alley
of
our
american
civilization
the
southern
propaganda
against
the
negro
is
advancing
apace
in
the
north
by
many
dark
and
devious
ways
and
by
many
subtle
and
potent
means
northern
capital
and
enterprise
which
are
exploiting
the
south
industrially
assimilate
very
readily
the
southern
view
of
the
negro
who
must
be
kept
at
the
bottom
of
the
white
man
labor
system
and
civilization
intermarriage
of
northern
men
and
women
with
southern
men
and
women
helps
tremendously
the
propagation
of
the
southern
view
and
solution
of
the
race
problem
the
annual
meeting
and
mingling
at
the
national
capital
in
social
intercourse
of
the
wealth
and
fashion
and
leadership
of
both
sections
exerts
a
powerful
influence
in
accenting
points
of
agreement
rather
than
points
of
difference
between
them
the
feeling
has
risen
throughout
the
north
that
the
white
people
of
the
country
can
not
afford
either
in
terms
of
business
or
of
politics
to
quarrel
among
themselves
over
the
rights
and
wrongs
of
another
race
which
in
consequence
of
the
injustices
and
inequalities
suffered
by
it
at
their
hands
is
being
pushed
brutally
to
the
wall
the
whites
of
both
sections
make
themselves
believe
as
a
sort
of
salve
to
their
conscience
i
suppose
that
the
negro
in
their
midst
is
an
alien
race
is
a
element
in
the
body
politic
whose
ejectment
or
isolation
the
health
of
that
body
and
the
race
purity
of
the
whites
render
necessary
since
ejectment
is
impracticable
as
involving
too
huge
a
displacement
of
or
amputation
from
the
productive
labor
of
the
south
isolation
remains
the
only
alternative
the
whites
of
course
will
do
what
they
can
without
injuring
themselves
or
corrupting
their
race
ideals
or
affronting
their
race
prejudices
to
alleviate
the
inevitably
hard
lot
of
this
unfortunate
people
but
in
what
may
be
done
for
them
there
must
be
a
care
not
to
mix
with
it
any
foolish
sentiment
of
human
liberty
and
brotherhood
lest
it
give
offense
to
the
south
and
so
interrupt
the
flow
of
that
beautiful
and
brotherly
affection
which
is
increasingly
making
the
southern
whites
and
the
northern
whites
one
people
in
the
bonds
of
an
indissoluble
friendship
and
union
is
the
ominous
word
which
has
cast
its
dark
spell
over
the
north
and
has
turned
its
once
warm
and
active
sympathy
into
cold
indifference
and
cruel
apathy
we
had
better
look
at
the
situation
of
the
negro
in
the
united
states
without
blinking
the
facts
see
it
clear
and
see
it
straight
the
present
outlook
for
that
race
is
gloomy
and
depressing
and
this
gloom
and
depression
are
until
the
negro
gets
in
the
south
some
measurable
freedom
in
the
use
of
the
ballot
the
present
agencies
at
work
for
his
advancement
like
industrial
and
the
higher
education
and
the
acquisition
of
property
and
organized
agitation
in
the
north
for
his
rights
can
do
little
to
rescue
him
from
the
deep
pit
into
which
american
race
prejudice
has
pushed
and
penned
him
the
colored
american
child
has
a
poorer
chance
to
rise
in
the
scale
of
being
than
had
the
colored
american
child
of
a
generation
ago
he
has
a
poorer
chance
in
the
south
in
spite
of
his
increased
educational
opportunities
and
accomplishments
and
he
has
a
poorer
chance
in
the
north
for
as
the
condition
of
the
race
grows
worse
and
its
citizenship
deteriorates
politically
and
civilly
in
the
south
it
will
communicate
to
that
part
of
it
resident
in
the
north
something
of
its
own
sad
lot
legal
and
industrial
limitations
and
contracting
prospects
and
opportunities
this
is
the
inevitable
fate
of
a
ballotless
race
or
class
in
an
industrial
democracy
like
ours
such
is
the
fate
which
awaits
the
american
negro
unless
he
can
manage
to
get
the
right
to
vote
in
the
south
and
this
fate
he
can
not
escape
so
long
as
he
remains
a
ballotless
man
with
no
weapon
of
defense
against
the
white
man
race
prejudice
which
is
regnant
in
his
home
and
church
and
government
and
press
and
mills
and
shops
and
trades
and
schools
it
is
as
impossible
for
the
negro
to
escape
from
his
blind
alley
without
the
ballot
as
it
is
for
some
foolish
fly
imprisoned
on
a
window
pane
to
find
its
way
to
freedom
through
it
there
is
no
escape
for
the
fly
until
its
restless
activities
discover
the
right
direction
and
to
change
the
figure
there
is
none
for
the
negro
out
of
his
slough
of
despond
until
he
can
lay
hold
of
the
ballot
wanting
the
ballot
no
amount
of
education
and
wealth
in
the
south
and
of
agitation
in
the
north
will
of
themselves
be
able
to
make
southern
governments
responsive
to
the
needs
and
the
rights
of
the
negro
as
laborer
and
citizen
but
until
they
are
made
to
respond
to
his
claim
for
social
justice
and
civil
rights
he
will
continue
in
the
future
as
he
is
the
helpless
victim
of
the
peonage
and
convict
lease
systems
of
the
plantation
lease
and
credit
systems
of
contract
labor
and
jim
crow
laws
of
lynching
and
the
inequitable
distribution
of
the
public
school
funds
between
the
races
i
can
not
repeat
too
often
that
such
monstrous
depression
of
a
part
of
southern
labor
is
not
less
bad
for
the
whites
than
it
is
for
the
blacks
nothing
else
can
possibly
come
of
it
in
the
future
than
has
come
of
it
in
the
past
but
evil
to
the
south
arrested
development
and
a
backward
civilization
for
the
whites
can
not
advance
in
law
and
order
in
private
and
public
morals
in
wealth
and
in
industrial
intelligence
and
efficiency
with
the
speed
commensurate
with
their
social
and
sectional
opportunity
if
they
persist
in
wasting
so
much
of
their
individual
and
collective
energies
in
keeping
the
negro
down
at
the
bottom
of
their
social
and
political
fabric
without
regard
to
his
merits
and
abilities
low
water
mark
has
been
reached
in
the
ebb
tide
of
negro
citizenship
in
the
south
once
upon
a
time
the
race
was
represented
in
congress
but
today
the
tribe
of
the
negro
congressmen
is
extinct
and
has
long
been
extinct
a
few
years
ago
it
had
its
representatives
on
the
republican
national
committee
but
today
the
tribe
of
the
negro
national
committeemen
is
extinct
the
year
may
be
memorable
among
other
things
for
witnessing
the
last
appearance
as
a
power
in
republican
national
conventions
of
the
southern
negro
delegate
the
place
which
once
knew
him
in
those
quadrennial
gatherings
of
the
warwicks
of
the
party
will
soon
know
him
there
no
more
forever
for
the
old
order
changeth
yielding
place
to
new
and
god
fulfils
himself
in
many
ways
lest
one
good
custom
should
corrupt
the
world
although
the
situation
is
depressing
it
is
far
from
hopeless
i
think
since
the
rise
of
the
new
progressive
party
for
that
party
will
be
able
to
do
in
the
south
what
the
republican
party
has
proved
itself
incapable
of
doing
namely
of
attracting
to
itself
southern
white
men
in
sufficient
numbers
to
make
of
it
a
formidable
party
of
opposition
in
southern
affairs
it
will
not
encounter
the
ancient
distrust
the
inveterate
hatred
and
contempt
which
the
republican
party
arouses
in
those
states
and
which
have
paralyzed
its
usefulness
and
reduced
it
as
a
party
of
opposition
to
the
zero
point
in
southern
politics
it
is
a
notorious
fact
that
the
southern
whites
as
a
class
will
not
affiliate
with
any
political
organization
on
terms
of
equality
with
the
blacks
that
is
they
may
be
educated
to
accept
the
negro
as
a
voter
but
nothing
can
induce
them
to
accept
him
as
a
leader
white
and
black
party
following
with
white
leadership
is
therefore
the
only
feasible
proposition
which
stands
any
show
of
success
as
a
party
of
opposition
in
that
section
under
existing
conditions
such
a
proposition
the
republican
party
is
incapable
of
making
for
reasons
already
pointed
out
and
the
democratic
party
for
other
and
obvious
reasons
is
precluded
from
offering
and
yet
if
relief
is
ever
to
come
to
the
negro
in
the
south
it
must
come
to
him
by
the
way
of
an
opposition
party
which
will
put
an
end
to
the
political
solidity
of
that
section
by
introducing
into
it
in
place
of
its
governments
this
i
take
it
is
the
meaning
of
colonel
roosevelt
action
at
chicago
last
august
relative
to
the
representation
of
southern
colored
men
in
the
bull
moose
convention
which
launched
the
progressive
party
and
for
which
he
was
widely
commended
and
as
widely
censured
by
white
and
colored
people
alike
in
all
parts
of
the
country
some
of
the
white
people
who
commended
his
action
did
so
undoubtedly
in
the
belief
that
the
leader
of
the
new
party
gave
thereby
his
approval
to
the
southern
solution
of
the
race
problem
this
group
is
made
up
speaking
generally
of
southern
bourbons
and
northern
doughfaces
their
interpretation
of
the
action
is
a
total
misapprehension
of
his
far
seeing
and
statesmanlike
purpose
and
of
the
tremendous
consequences
for
good
which
it
holds
for
both
races
at
the
south
and
for
the
people
of
the
whole
nation
likewise
tremendous
consequences
for
good
which
are
as
surely
enfolded
within
the
great
purpose
as
the
fertilizing
principle
is
contained
within
the
egg
many
of
those
on
the
other
hand
who
censured
him
did
so
because
obsessed
by
their
hate
or
dread
of
him
they
failed
to
eliminate
their
imaginary
tyrant
or
dictator
their
fixed
idea
of
the
man
from
consideration
of
the
immense
value
and
statesmanship
of
his
act
to
such
men
it
was
but
another
example
of
the
brutal
and
colossal
selfishness
of
the
candidate
for
did
he
not
welcome
to
his
convention
colored
men
as
delegates
from
states
where
the
colored
vote
counts
and
reject
certain
other
colored
men
as
delegates
from
states
where
the
colored
vote
does
not
count
now
this
view
of
colonel
roosevelt
action
seems
to
me
to
miss
the
mark
quite
as
widely
as
did
that
of
our
southern
bourbons
and
northern
doughfaces
that
the
founder
of
the
new
political
party
as
a
practical
man
should
discriminate
between
colored
men
with
a
vote
and
colored
men
without
a
vote
seems
to
me
to
be
altogether
natural
to
grow
in
fact
out
of
the
necessities
of
every
democracy
which
is
governed
first
by
one
party
and
then
by
another
that
colored
men
with
the
ballot
should
be
rated
in
terms
of
the
political
game
higher
than
other
colored
men
who
have
it
not
violates
no
rule
of
business
ethics
and
politics
is
business
is
the
big
business
is
it
not
or
ought
it
not
to
be
the
big
business
of
all
self
governing
peoples
who
would
maintain
justice
and
freedom
for
themselves
and
transmit
them
unimpaired
to
their
posterity
colonel
roosevelt
as
the
leader
of
the
new
party
recognized
at
his
full
political
value
the
negro
in
states
where
his
vote
is
counted
and
perceived
the
very
slight
value
potential
and
actual
as
a
party
asset
of
the
negro
in
states
where
his
vote
is
not
counted
he
and
the
progressive
party
have
not
engaged
in
the
big
business
of
american
politics
for
their
health
or
amusement
but
for
the
purpose
of
carrying
forward
to
success
great
and
far
reaching
measures
of
reform
which
exclude
from
their
benefits
no
race
or
class
on
account
of
color
or
sex
but
includes
all
american
citizens
black
and
white
alike
but
to
do
this
to
realize
on
their
party
promises
and
pledges
to
the
people
they
must
have
votes
not
mere
good
will
which
can
not
translate
itself
into
effective
support
on
election
day
but
the
action
at
chicago
goes
deeper
than
this
primal
need
of
his
party
for
votes
it
reaches
down
to
the
springs
of
fundamental
social
and
political
changes
at
the
south
in
relation
to
its
race
question
and
sets
in
motion
the
healing
waters
of
its
pool
of
bethesda
which
will
in
time
heal
it
of
its
sickness
and
cleanse
it
of
its
sins
against
law
justice
and
democracy
i
do
not
mean
to
belittle
in
any
way
other
agencies
now
at
work
on
the
solution
of
our
terrible
race
problem
such
as
education
or
wealth
or
agitation
not
at
all
for
they
are
most
important
but
without
the
ballot
they
are
impotent
to
give
the
relief
so
much
needed
in
the
south
there
must
be
added
to
them
this
something
else
this
one
thing
needful
to
render
them
effective
to
save
the
blacks
from
the
evil
consequences
of
their
race
ignorance
and
the
whites
from
the
evil
consequences
of
their
race
prejudice
and
this
one
thing
needful
i
believe
the
progressive
party
brings
to
the
solution
of
the
problem
and
that
it
formed
the
underlying
motive
and
the
statesmanlike
purpose
of
