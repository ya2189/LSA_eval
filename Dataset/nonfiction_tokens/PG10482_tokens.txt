anecdote
of
a
teacher
concluding
advice
to
mothers
preface
there
is
a
prejudice
abroad
to
some
extent
against
agitating
the
questions
what
shall
we
eat
what
shall
we
drink
and
wherewithal
shall
we
be
clothed
not
so
much
because
the
scriptures
have
charged
us
not
to
be
over
anxious
on
the
subject
as
because
those
who
pay
the
least
attention
to
what
they
eat
and
drink
are
supposed
to
be
after
all
the
most
healthy
it
is
not
difficult
to
ascertain
how
this
opinion
originated
there
are
a
few
individuals
who
are
perpetually
thinking
and
talking
on
this
subject
and
who
would
fain
comply
with
appropriate
rules
if
they
knew
what
they
were
and
if
a
certain
definite
course
pursued
a
few
days
only
would
change
their
whole
condition
and
completely
restore
a
shattered
or
ruined
constitution
but
their
ignorance
of
the
laws
which
govern
the
human
frame
both
in
sickness
and
in
health
and
their
indisposition
to
pursue
any
proposed
plan
for
their
improvement
long
enough
to
receive
much
permanent
benefit
from
it
keep
them
notwithstanding
all
they
say
or
do
always
deteriorating
then
on
the
other
hand
there
are
a
few
who
in
consequence
of
possessing
by
nature
very
strong
constitutions
and
laboring
at
some
active
and
peculiarly
healthy
employment
are
able
for
a
few
and
perhaps
even
for
many
years
to
set
all
the
rules
of
health
at
defiance
now
strange
as
it
may
seem
these
cases
though
they
are
only
exceptions
and
those
more
apparent
than
real
to
the
general
rule
are
always
dwelt
upon
by
those
who
are
determined
to
live
as
they
please
and
to
put
no
restraint
either
upon
themselves
or
their
appetites
for
nothing
can
be
plainer
so
it
seems
to
me
than
that
taking
mankind
by
families
or
what
is
still
better
by
larger
portions
they
are
most
free
from
pain
and
disease
as
well
as
most
healthy
and
happy
who
pay
the
most
attention
to
the
laws
of
human
health
that
is
those
laws
or
rules
by
whose
observance
alone
that
health
can
be
certainly
and
permanently
secured
but
these
families
and
communities
are
most
healthy
and
happy
not
because
they
live
in
a
proper
manner
by
fits
and
starts
but
because
they
have
from
some
cause
or
other
adopted
and
persevered
in
habits
which
compared
with
the
habits
of
other
families
or
other
communities
are
preferable
that
is
more
in
obedience
to
the
laws
which
govern
the
human
constitution
not
that
even
are
without
sin
or
error
on
this
subject
gross
error
too
but
because
their
errors
are
fewer
or
less
destructive
than
those
of
their
neighbors
now
is
it
possible
that
any
intelligent
father
or
mother
of
a
family
whose
diet
clothing
exercise
are
thus
comparatively
well
regulated
would
derive
no
benefit
from
the
perusal
of
works
which
treat
candidly
rationally
and
dispassionately
on
these
points
is
there
a
mother
in
the
community
who
is
so
destitute
of
reason
and
common
sense
as
not
to
desire
the
light
of
a
broader
experience
in
regard
to
the
tendency
of
things
than
she
has
had
or
possibly
can
have
in
her
own
family
is
there
one
who
will
not
be
aided
by
understanding
not
only
that
a
certain
thing
or
course
is
better
than
another
but
also
why
it
is
so
it
is
by
no
means
the
object
of
this
little
work
to
set
people
to
watching
their
stomachs
from
meal
to
meal
in
regard
to
the
effects
of
food
drink
for
nothing
in
the
world
is
better
calculated
to
make
dyspeptics
than
this
it
is
true
indeed
that
some
things
may
be
obviously
and
greatly
injurious
taken
only
once
and
when
they
are
so
they
should
be
avoided
but
in
general
it
is
the
effect
of
a
habitual
use
of
certain
things
for
a
long
time
together
and
the
longer
the
experiment
the
better
which
we
are
to
observe
a
book
to
guide
mothers
in
the
formation
of
early
good
habits
in
their
offspring
should
be
the
result
of
long
observation
and
much
experiment
on
these
points
but
more
especially
of
a
thorough
understanding
of
human
physiology
it
should
not
consist
so
much
of
the
conceits
of
a
single
brain
perhaps
half
turned
as
of
the
logical
deductions
of
severe
science
and
facts
gleaned
from
the
world
history
here
is
a
nation
or
tribe
of
men
bringing
up
children
to
certain
habits
from
generation
to
generation
and
such
and
such
is
their
character
here
again
is
another
large
portion
of
our
race
who
under
similar
circumstances
of
climate
have
for
several
hundred
years
educated
their
children
very
differently
and
with
different
results
a
comparison
of
things
on
a
large
scale
together
with
a
close
attention
to
the
constitution
and
relations
of
the
human
system
affords
ground
for
drawing
conclusions
which
are
or
may
be
useful
if
this
book
shall
not
afford
light
derived
from
such
sources
it
were
far
better
that
it
had
never
been
written
if
it
only
sets
people
to
watching
over
the
effects
of
things
taken
or
used
only
for
a
single
day
instead
of
leading
them
from
early
infancy
to
form
in
their
children
such
habits
as
will
preclude
in
a
great
measure
the
necessity
of
watching
ourselves
daily
then
let
the
day
perish
from
the
memory
of
the
writer
in
which
the
plan
of
bringing
it
forth
to
the
world
was
conceived
but
he
is
confident
of
better
things
he
does
not
believe
that
a
work
which
to
such
an
extent
gives
the
reason
why
will
be
productive
of
more
evil
than
good
on
the
contrary
it
must
if
read
have
the
opposite
effect
i
do
not
deny
that
even
after
the
formation
of
the
best
habits
there
will
be
a
necessity
of
paying
some
attention
to
what
we
eat
and
what
we
drink
from
day
to
day
and
from
hour
to
hour
but
only
that
the
tendency
of
this
work
is
not
to
increase
this
necessity
but
on
the
contrary
to
diminish
it
in
my
own
view
these
occasions
of
inquiry
in
regard
to
what
is
right
as
well
as
are
one
part
of
our
trials
in
this
world
one
means
of
forming
our
characters
we
are
constantly
tempted
to
excess
and
to
error
in
spite
of
the
most
firm
habits
of
which
can
be
formed
if
we
resist
temptation
our
characters
are
improved
and
it
is
by
and
in
these
smaller
matters
that
we
are
to
hope
for
nearly
all
the
progress
we
can
ever
make
in
the
great
work
of
great
trials
of
character
come
but
seldom
and
when
they
come
we
are
often
armed
against
them
but
these
little
trials
and
temptations
coming
upon
us
every
hour
these
it
is
after
all
that
give
shape
to
our
characters
and
make
us
constantly
growing
either
better
or
worse
both
in
the
sight
of
god
and
man
but
as
i
have
repeatedly
said
the
object
of
this
work
is
to
diminish
rather
than
to
increase
the
frequency
of
these
trials
useful
though
they
may
be
if
duly
improved
in
the
formation
of
virtuous
and
even
of
holy
character
there
is
a
sense
in
which
every
infant
may
be
said
to
be
born
healthy
so
that
we
may
not
only
adopt
the
language
of
the
poet
bowring
and
say
a
child
is
born
take
it
and
make
it
a
bud
of
beauty
but
we
may
also
add
take
it
and
make
it
beautiful
for
though
a
hereditary
predisposition
undoubtedly
renders
some
individuals
more
susceptible
than
others
to
particular
diseases
yet
when
the
bodily
organization
of
an
infant
is
complete
and
the
degree
of
vitality
which
nature
gives
it
is
sufficient
to
propel
the
machinery
of
the
frame
it
can
scarcely
be
regarded
as
in
any
other
state
than
that
of
health
now
if
it
be
the
intention
of
divine
providence
and
who
will
doubt
that
it
is
that
the
animal
body
should
be
capable
of
resisting
with
impunity
the
impressions
of
heat
cold
light
air
and
the
various
external
influences
to
which
at
birth
it
is
subjected
it
may
be
properly
asked
why
this
primitive
state
of
health
can
not
be
maintained
and
diseases
and
medicines
and
even
preventives
wholly
avoided
but
the
reason
is
obvious
civilized
society
has
placed
the
human
race
in
artificial
circumstances
instead
of
listening
to
the
dictates
of
reason
making
ourselves
acquainted
with
the
nature
of
the
human
constitution
and
studying
to
preserve
it
in
health
and
vigor
we
yield
to
the
government
of
ignorance
and
presumption
the
first
moment
even
in
which
we
draw
breath
sees
us
placed
under
the
control
of
individuals
who
are
totally
inadequate
to
the
important
charge
of
preserving
the
infant
constitution
in
its
original
state
and
aiding
its
progress
to
maturity
and
thus
it
is
that
though
infants
as
a
general
rule
may
be
said
to
be
born
healthy
few
actually
remain
so
seldom
indeed
do
we
find
a
person
who
has
arrived
at
maturity
wholly
free
from
disease
even
in
those
parts
of
our
country
which
are
reckoned
to
have
the
most
healthy
climate
it
is
indeed
commonly
said
that
a
large
proportion
both
of
children
and
adults
among
the
agricultural
portion
of
our
population
are
healthy
but
it
is
not
so
there
is
room
for
doubt
whether
on
the
whole
the
farmers
of
this
country
are
healthier
than
the
mechanics
or
much
more
so
than
the
manufacturers
or
the
whole
mass
of
the
country
population
healthier
than
that
of
the
crowded
city
the
causes
of
disease
are
sufficiently
numerous
in
all
places
and
conditions
and
this
will
continue
to
be
the
fact
not
merely
until
parents
and
teachers
shall
become
more
enlightened
but
until
many
generations
have
been
trained
under
their
enlightened
influence
if
the
children
and
adults
among
our
agricultural
population
derive
from
their
employments
in
the
open
air
a
more
ruddy
appearance
than
those
either
of
the
city
or
country
who
are
confined
more
to
their
rooms
or
to
a
vitiated
atmosphere
and
to
numerous
other
sources
of
disease
and
if
they
more
favored
with
health
i
have
learned
by
accurate
observation
that
these
appearances
are
somewhat
deceptive
their
active
sports
and
employments
in
the
open
air
give
them
a
stronger
appetite
than
any
other
class
of
people
and
the
indulgence
of
this
appetite
not
only
with
articles
which
are
heating
or
indigestible
in
their
nature
but
with
an
unreasonable
quantity
even
of
those
which
are
considered
highly
proper
is
almost
in
an
exact
proportion
and
it
is
hence
scarcely
possible
for
the
causes
of
disease
and
premature
death
to
be
more
operative
in
factories
and
in
cities
than
in
farm
houses
and
the
country
indeed
it
may
be
questioned
whether
the
abuses
of
the
animal
part
of
man
more
common
in
some
of
their
forms
in
country
than
in
city
though
they
may
be
less
conspicuous
are
not
more
certainly
and
even
more
immediately
destructive
than
those
abuses
which
in
city
life
and
bustle
and
competition
affect
more
the
moral
nature
be
that
as
it
may
however
for
this
is
not
the
place
for
the
grave
discussion
of
so
broad
a
question
one
thing
to
my
mind
is
perfectly
clear
namely
that
until
physical
education
shall
receive
more
attention
from
all
those
who
hold
the
sacred
office
of
instructors
of
the
young
humanity
can
neither
be
much
elevated
nor
improved
mothers
and
schoolmasters
especially
they
who
as
dr
rush
says
plant
the
seeds
of
nearly
all
the
good
or
evil
in
the
world
must
understand
most
deeply
and
thoroughly
the
laws
which
regulate
the
various
provinces
of
the
little
world
in
which
the
soul
resides
and
which
like
so
many
states
of
a
great
confederacy
have
not
only
their
separate
interests
and
rights
but
certain
common
and
general
ones
as
well
as
those
laws
by
which
the
human
constitution
is
related
to
and
connected
with
the
objects
which
everywhere
surround
and
influence
and
limit
and
extend
it
this
book
contains
little
if
anything
new
to
those
who
are
already
familiar
with
anatomy
and
physiology
indeed
whatever
may
be
its
claims
its
merits
or
its
demerits
it
disclaims
novelty
it
is
indeed
in
one
point
of
view
i
mean
in
its
form
manner
and
arrangement
what
i
have
written
is
chiefly
from
my
own
resources
the
results
of
patient
study
and
observation
and
careful
reflection
but
that
study
and
observation
of
human
nature
and
this
reflection
have
been
greatly
aided
by
reading
the
writings
of
others
in
the
prosecution
of
the
task
which
i
had
assigned
myself
no
work
has
been
of
more
service
to
me
than
an
octavo
volume
of
pages
by
wm
dewees
of
philadelphia
entitled
a
treatise
on
the
physical
and
medical
treatment
of
children
it
is
one
of
the
most
valuable
works
on
physical
education
in
the
english
language
as
is
evident
from
the
fact
that
notwithstanding
its
expense
three
or
four
dollars
it
has
in
nine
years
gone
through
five
editions
if
it
were
written
in
such
a
style
and
published
at
such
a
price
as
would
bring
it
within
reach
of
the
minds
and
purses
of
the
mass
of
the
community
its
sale
would
have
been
i
think
much
greater
still
and
the
good
which
it
has
accomplished
would
have
been
increased
if
the
young
mother
should
be
favorably
received
by
the
american
community
and
prove
extensively
useful
it
will
undoubtedly
be
owing
to
the
fact
that
it
presents
so
large
a
collection
of
facts
and
principles
on
the
great
subject
of
physical
education
in
a
manner
so
practical
and
at
a
price
which
is
very
low
to
accomplish
an
object
so
desirable
is
by
no
means
an
easy
task
it
was
once
said
by
the
author
of
a
huge
volume
that
he
wrote
so
large
a
work
because
he
had
not
time
to
prepare
a
smaller
one
and
however
unaccountable
it
may
be
to
those
who
have
not
made
the
trial
it
may
be
safely
asserted
that
to
present
within
limits
so
small
anything
like
a
system
of
physical
education
for
the
guidance
of
young
mothers
requires
much
more
time
and
labor
and
patience
than
to
prepare
a
work
on
the
same
subject
twice
as
large
nor
is
it
to
be
expected
after
all
that
the
work
is
in
all
respects
perfect
i
have
indeed
done
what
i
could
to
render
it
so
but
am
conscious
that
future
inquiries
may
lead
to
the
discovery
of
errors
should
such
discoveries
be
made
they
will
be
cheerfully
acknowledged
and
corrected

being

it
should
be

the

must

with

they
can
get

there
are
various

for

be

to
those
who
the

can
not

who
it
may
lead
those
who
have

to
extend
the
hand
of
charity
in
this
important
direction
for
there
are
not
a
few
who
have
little
sympathy
with
the
wants
and
distresses
of
the
adult
poor
who
will
yet
open
their
hearts
and
unfold
their
hands
for
the
relief
of
suffering
among
those
who
have
what
is
called
a

for
this
purpose
the
most
appropriate
part
of

is
not
unfrequently

can

be

health
and
happiness
of
its
occupants
is
usually
at
best
a
secondary
consideration
but
this
ought
not
so
to
be
a
nursery
should
never
for
example
be
on
a
ground
floor
or
in
a
shaded
situation
or
in
any
circumstances
which
expose
it
to
dampness
or
hinder
the
occasional
approach
of
the
light
of
the
sun
it
should
be
spacious
with
dry
walls
high
ceiling
and
tight
windows
the
latter
should
always
be
so
constructed
that
the
upper
sash
can
be
lowered
when
we
wish
to
admit
or
exclude
air
it
should
have
a
chimney
if
possible
but
if
not
there
should
be
suitable
holes
in
the
ceiling
for
the
purposes
of
ventilation
the
windows
should
have
shutters
so
that
the
room
when
necessary
can
be
darkened
and
green
curtains
some
writers
say
that
the
windows
should
have
cross
bars
before
them
but
if
they
do
not
descend
within
three
feet
of
the
floor
such
an
arrangement
can
hardly
be
required
it
is
highly
desirable
that
every
nursery
should
consist
of
two
rooms
opening
into
each
other
or
what
is
still
better
of
one
large
room
with
a
sliding
or
swinging
partition
in
the
middle
the
use
of
this
is
that
the
mother
and
child
may
retire
to
one
while
the
other
is
being
swept
or
ventilated
they
would
thus
avoid
damp
air
currents
and
dust
such
an
arrangement
would
also
give
the
occupants
a
room
fresh
clean
and
sweet
in
the
morning
which
is
a
very
great
advantage
after
having
rendered
the
air
of
the
other
foul
by
sleeping
in
it
in
winter
and
while
there
is
an
infant
in
the
nursery
just
beginning
to
walk
it
is
recommended
by
many
to
cover
the
floor
with
a
carpet
the
only
advantage
which
they
mention
is
that
it
secures
the
child
from
injury
if
it
falls
but
i
have
seldom
seen
lasting
injury
inflicted
by
simple
falls
on
the
hard
floor
and
there
are
so
many
objections
to
carpeting
a
nursery
since
it
favors
an
accumulation
of
dust
bad
air
damp
grease
and
other
impurities
that
it
seems
to
me
preferable
to
omit
it
many
physicians
i
must
own
recommend
carpets
during
winter
though
not
in
summer
and
in
no
case
unless
they
are
well
shaken
and
aired
at
least
once
a
week
no
furniture
should
be
admissible
except
the
beds
for
the
mother
and
child
a
table
and
a
few
chairs
with
the
best
writers
and
highest
authorities
on
the
subject
i
am
decidedly
of
opinion
that
all
feather
beds
ought
effectually
and
forever
to
be
excluded
from
nurseries
the
reasons
for
this
prohibition
will
appear
hereafter
every
nursery
should
if
possible
be
free
from
holes
or
crevices
otherwise
the
occupants
will
be
exposed
to
currents
of
air
and
their
sometimes
terrible
and
always
injurious
consequences
the
room
may
in
this
way
be
kept
at
a
lower
medium
temperature
a
point
of
very
great
importance
cats
and
dogs
i
believe
are
usually
excluded
from
the
nursery
if
not
they
ought
to
be
for
though
the
apprehension
of
cats
sucking
the
child
breath
is
wholly
groundless
yet
they
may
be
provoked
by
the
rude
attacks
of
a
child
to
inflict
upon
it
a
lasting
injury
besides
they
assist
by
respiration
in
contaminating
the
air
like
all
other
animals
if
there
are
in
the
nursery
objects
which
from
the
vivacity
or
brilliancy
of
their
colors
attract
the
attention
of
the
child
they
should
never
be
presented
to
them
sideways
or
immediately
over
their
heads
the
reason
for
this
caution
is
that
children
seek
and
pursue
almost
instinctively
bright
objects
and
are
thus
liable
to
contract
a
habit
of
moving
their
eyes
in
an
oblique
direction
which
terminate
in
squinting
many
parents
seem
to
take
great
pleasure
in
indulging
the
young
infant
in
looking
at
these
bright
objects
especially
a
lamp
or
a
candle
if
the
child
is
naturally
strong
and
vigorous
no
immediate
perceptible
injury
may
arise
but
i
am
confident
in
the
opinion
that
the
result
is
often
quite
otherwise
for
many
weeks
if
not
many
months
of
their
early
existence
they
should
not
be
permitted
to
sit
or
lie
and
gaze
at
any
bright
object
be
it
ever
so
weak
or
distant
unless
placed
exactly
before
their
eyes
and
even
in
the
latter
case
it
were
better
to
avoid
it
heat
is
also
injurious
to
the
eyes
of
all
and
of
course
not
less
so
to
children
than
to
adults
but
when
a
strong
light
and
heat
are
conjoined
as
is
the
case
of
sitting
around
a
large
blazing
fire
the
former
custom
of
new
england
it
is
no
wonder
if
the
infantile
eyes
become
early
injured
no
wonder
that
the
generation
now
on
the
stage
early
subjected
to
these
abuses
should
be
found
almost
universally
in
the
use
of
spectacles
this
may
be
the
most
proper
place
for
observing
that
great
care
ought
to
be
taken
at
the
birth
of
the
child
to
prevent
a
too
sudden
exposure
of
the
tender
organ
of
vision
to
the
light
we
believe
this
caution
is
generally
omitted
by
the
american
physician
though
it
is
one
which
accords
with
the
plainest
dictates
of
common
sense
who
of
us
has
not
experienced
the
pain
of
emerging
suddenly
from
the
darkness
of
a
cellar
to
the
ordinary
light
of
day
the
strongest
eyes
of
the
adult
are
scarcely
able
to
bear
the
transition
how
much
more
painful
to
the
tender
organs
of
the
infant
must
be
the
change
to
which
it
is
so
frequently
subjected
and
how
easy
it
is
to
prevent
the
pain
and
danger
of
the
change
by
more
effectually
darkening
the
room
into
which
it
is
introduced
but
we
have
testimony
on
this
point
a
distinguished
german
physician
states
that
he
has
known
many
cases
of
permanent
blindness
from
this
very
cause
to
which
we
have
referred
the
principal
of
the
institution
for
the
blind
at
vienna
says
he
is
confident
that
most
children
who
appear
to
be
born
blind
are
actually
made
blind
by
neglecting
this
same
precaution

there
is
one
general
principle
on
this
subject
which
is
alike
applicable
to
all
persons
and
circumstances
it
is
to
keep
a
little
too
cool
rather
than
in
the
slightest
degree
too
warm
in
other
words
the
lowest
temperature
which
is
compatible
with
comfort
is
in
all
cases
best
adapted
to
health
and
a
slight
degree
of
coldness
provided
it
amount
not
to
a
chill
and
is
not
long
continued
is
more
safe
than
the
smallest
unnecessary
degree
of
warmth
but
the
application
of
this
rule
to
those
over
whom
we
have
control
is
not
without
its
difficulties
our
own
sensations
are
so
variable
independently
of
external
and
obvious
causes
that
we
can
not
at
all
times
judge
for
others
especially
for
infants
the
absolute
and
real
state
of
temperature
in
a
room
can
only
be
ascertained
by
the
aid
of
a
thermometer
and
no
nursery
should
ever
be
without
one
it
should
be
placed
however
in
such
a
situation
as
to
indicate
the
real
temperature
of
the
atmosphere
and
not
where
it
will
give
a
false
result
no
mother
should
forget
that
the
infant
at
birth
has
not
the
power
of
generating
heat
internally
to
the
extent
which
it
possesses
afterward
the
lungs
have
as
yet
but
a
feeble
inefficient
action
the
purification
of
the
blood
through
their
agency
is
not
only
incomplete
but
the
heat
evolved
is
as
yet
inconsiderable
in
the
absence
of
internal
heat
then
there
is
an
increased
demand
externally
if
be
deemed
suitable
for
most
other
persons
the
infant
may
for
a
few
days
require
or
even
much
may
and
should
be
done
in
preserving
the
child
in
a
proper
temperature
by
means
of
its
clothing
on
this
point
i
shall
speak
at
length
in
another
part
of
this
work
my
present
purpose
is
simply
to
treat
of
the
temperature
of
the
nursery
the
best
way
of
warming
a
nursery
or
indeed
any
other
room
where
mere
warmth
is
demanded
is
by
means
of
air
heated
in
other
apartments
and
admitted
through
openings
in
the
floor
or
the
air
is
not
only
thus
made
more
pure
but
every
possibility
of
accidents
such
as
having
the
clothes
take
fire
is
precluded
this
last
consideration
is
one
of
very
great
importance
and
i
hope
will
not
be
much
longer
overlooked
in
infantile
education
next
to
that
in
point
of
usefulness
and
safety
is
a
stove
placed
near
or
in
the
and
defended
by
an
iron
railing
most
people
prefer
an
open
stove
and
on
some
accounts
it
is
indeed
preferable
especially
where
it
is
desirable
to
burn
coal
still
i
think
that
the
direct
rays
of
the
heat
and
the
glare
of
light
from
open
stoves
and
particularly
for
the
young
form
a
very
serious
objection
to
their
use
one
of
the
strongest
objections
to
open
stoves
and
in
the
nursery
is
the
increased
exposure
to
accidents
i
know
it
is
said
that
this
evil
may
be
avoided
by
laying
aside
the
use
of
cotton
and
wearing
nothing
but
worsted
or
flannel
this
is
indeed
true
but
i
do
not
like
the
idea
of
being
compelled
to
dress
children
in
flannel
or
worsted
at
all
times
when
the
least
particle
of
fire
is
demanded
for
this
would
be
to
wear
this
stimulating
kind
of
clothing
in
our
climate
the
greater
part
of
the
year
besides
i
write
for
many
mothers
who
are
compelled
to
use
cotton
on
account
of
the
expense
of
flannel
and
if
the
stove
be
a
close
one
and
well
defended
by
a
railing
cotton
will
seldom
expose
to
danger
still
as
has
been
already
said
the
introduction
of
heated
air
from
another
apartment
whenever
it
can
possibly
be
afforded
is
incomparably
better
than
either
stoves
or
dewees
is
fully
persuaded
that
the
excessive
heat
of
nurseries
has
occasioned
a
great
mortality
among
very
young
children
in
the
first
place
he
says
it
them
and
in
the
second
it
renders
them
so
susceptible
of
cold
that
any
draught
of
cold
air
endangers
their
lives
they
are
in
a
constant
perspiration
which
is
frequently
checked
by
an
exposure
to
even
an
atmosphere
of
moderate
temperature
if
this
is
but
to
repeat
what
has
been
already
said
the
importance
of
the
subject
seems
to
be
a
sufficient
apology

it
is
not
my
purpose
to
go
into
a
learned
scientific
account
in
this
place
or
even
in
this
work
of
the
constitution
of
the
atmosphere
a
few
plain
statements
are
all
that
are
indispensable
the
atmosphere
which
we
breathe
is
composed
of
two
different
airs
or
gases
one
of
these
is
called
oxygen
footnote
oxygen
gas
is
the
chief
supporter
of
combustion
as
well
as
of
respiration
it
is
the
vital
part
as
it
were
of
the
air
no
animal
or
vegetable
could
long
exist
without
it
and
yet
if
alone
unmixed
it
is
too
pure
and
too
refined
for
animals
to
breathe
nitrogen
gas
on
the
contrary
while
alone
will
not
support
either
respiration
or
combustion
mixed
however
with
oxygen
it
dilutes
it
and
in
the
most
happy
manner
fits
it
for
reception
into
the
lungs
and
the
other
nitrogen
there
is
another
gas
usually
found
with
these
two
in
smaller
quantity
called
carbonic
acid
gas
but
whether
it
is
necessary
in
a
very
small
quantity
to
health
chemists
i
believe
are
not
agreed
one
thing
however
is
certain
that
if
any
portion
of
it
is
healthful
it
must
be
very
little
not
more
certainly
than
or
of
the
whole
mass
it
is
by
means
of
the
oxygen
it
contains
that
air
sustains
life
and
combustion
were
it
not
for
this
neither
fires
nor
candles
would
burn
and
no
animal
could
breathe
a
single
moment
breathing
consumes
this
oxygen
of
the
air
very
rapidly
when
the
oxygen
is
present
in
about
a
certain
proportion
combustion
and
respiration
go
on
well
but
when
its
natural
proportion
is
diminished
the
fire
does
not
burn
so
well
neither
does
the
candle
and
no
one
can
breathe
so
freely
not
only
are
breathing
and
combustion
impeded
or
disturbed
by
the
diminution
of
oxygen
in
the
atmosphere
but
just
in
proportion
as
oxygen
is
diminished
by
these
two
processes
or
either
of
them
carbonic
acid
is
formed
which
is
not
only
bad
for
combustion
but
much
worse
for
health
if
any
considerable
quantity
of
it
is
inhaled
it
appears
to
be
an
absolute
poison
to
the
human
system
and
if
in
large
will
often
cause
immediate
death
it
is
this
gas
accumulated
in
large
quantities
that
destroys
so
many
people
in
close
rooms
where
there
is
no
chimney
nor
any
other
place
for
the
bad
air
to
escape
but
it
not
only
kills
people
outright
it
partly
kills
that
is
it
poisons
more
or
less
hundreds
of
thousands
in
a
nursery
there
is
the
mother
and
child
and
perhaps
the
nurse
to
render
the
air
impure
by
breathing
the
fire
and
the
lamp
or
candle
to
contribute
to
the
same
result
besides
several
other
causes
not
yet
mentioned
one
of
these
is
nearly
related
to
the
former
i
allude
to
the
fact
that
our
skins
by
perspiration
and
by
other
means
are
a
source
of
much
impurity
to
the
atmosphere
a
fact
which
will
be
more
fully
explained
and
illustrated
in
the
chapter
on
bathing
and
cleanliness
it
is
only
necessary
to
say
in
this
place
that
it
is
not
the
matter
of
perspiration
alone
which
issuing
from
the
skin
renders
the
air
impure
there
are
other
exhalations
more
or
less
constantly
going
off
from
every
living
body
especially
from
the
lungs
and
carbonic
acid
gas
is
even
formed
all
over
the
surface
of
the
skin
as
well
as
by
means
of
the
lungs
one
needs
no
better
proof
that
carbonic
acid
is
formed
on
the
surface
of
the
body
than
the
fact
that
after
the
body
has
been
closely
covered
all
night
if
you
introduce
a
candle
under
the
into
this
confined
air
it
will
be
quickly
extinguished
because
there
is
too
much
carbonic
acid
gas
there
and
too
little
oxygen
we
may
hence
see
at
once
the
evil
of
covering
the
heads
of
infants
when
they
lie
down
a
very
common
practice
the
air
when
pure
contains
a
little
more
than
parts
of
oxygen
and
a
little
less
than
of
nitrogen
breathing
this
air
as
i
have
already
shown
consumes
the
oxygen
which
is
so
necessary
to
life
and
health
and
leaves
in
its
place
an
increase
of
nitrogen
and
carbonic
acid
gas
which
are
not
necessary
to
health
and
the
latter
of
which
is
even
positively
injurious
but
when
the
oxygen
instead
of
forming
or
more
parts
in
of
the
atmosphere
of
the
nursery
is
reduced
to
or
parts
only
and
the
carbonic
acid
gas
is
increased
from
or
parts
in
to
or
when
to
this
is
added
the
other
noxious
exhalations
from
the
body
and
from
the
lamp
or
candle
feather
bed
stagnant
fluids
in
the
room
is
it
any
wonder
that
children
in
the
end
become
sickly
what
else
could
be
expected
but
that
the
seeds
of
disease
thus
early
sown
should
in
due
time
spring
up
and
produce
their
appropriate
fruits
it
is
sometimes
said
that
fire
in
a
room
purifies
it
it
undoubtedly
does
so
to
a
certain
extent
if
fresh
air
be
often
admitted
but
not
otherwise
i
have
classed
feather
beds
among
the
common
causes
of
impurity
dewees
also
condemns
them
most
decidedly
and
gives
substantial
reasons
for
driving
them
out
of
the
nursery
in
speaking
of
the
structure
of
the
room
used
for
a
nursery
i
have
adverted
to
the
importance
of
having
a
large
or
double
room
with
sliding
doors
between
in
order
that
the
occupants
may
go
into
one
of
them
while
the
other
is
being
ventilated
but
whatever
may
be
the
structure
of
the
room
the
circumstances
of
the
occupants
or
the
state
of
the
weather
every
nursery
ought
to
be
most
thoroughly
ventilated
once
a
day
at
least
and
when
the
weather
is
tolerable
twice
a
day
if
there
is
but
one
apartment
and
fear
is
entertained
of
the
dampness
of
the
fresh
air
introduced
or
of
currents
and
if
the
mother
and
babe
can
not
retire
there
is
a
last
resort
which
is
for
them
to
get
into
bed
and
cover
themselves
a
short
time
with
the
clothing
for
though
i
have
prohibited
the
covering
of
the
face
with
the
for
any
considerable
length
of
time
together
yet
to
do
so
for
some
fifteen
or
twenty
minutes
is
an
evil
of
far
less
magnitude
than
to
suffer
an
apartment
to
remain
without
being
ventilated
for
hours
together
a
very
common
occurrence
when
a
lamp
is
kept
burning
in
a
nursery
during
the
night
it
should
always
be
placed
at
the
door
of
the
stove
or
in
the
chimney
place
that
its
smoke
and
the
bad
airs
or
gases
which
are
formed
may
escape
but
it
is
better
in
general
to
avoid
burning
lamps
or
candles
during
the
night
by
means
of
common
matches
a
light
may
be
produced
when
necessary
almost
instantly
especially
if
you
have
a
spirit
lamp
in
the
nursery
or
what
is
still
better
one
of
spirit
gas
that
is
a
mixture
of
alcohol
and
turpentine
it
is
highly
desirable
that
all
washing
ironing
and
cooking
should
be
avoided
in
the
nursery
they
load
the
air
with
noxious
effluvia
or
vapor
or
with
particles
of
dust
none
of
which
ought
ever
to
enter
the
delicate
lungs
of
an
infant
fumigations
with
camphor
vinegar
and
other
similar
substances
have
long
been
in
reputation
as
a
means
of
purifying
the
air
in
and
nurseries
but
they
are
of
very
little
consequence
fresh
air
if
it
can
be
had
is
always
better

dress
serves
three

purposes
to
cover
us
to
defend
us
against
cold
to
defend
our
bodies
and
limbs
from
injury
there
is
one
more
purpose
of
dress
in
case
of
deformity
it
seems
to
improve
the
appearance
in
all
our
arrangements
in
regard
to
dress
whether
of
children
or
of
adults
we
should
ever
keep
in

the
above
principles
the
form

material
application
and
quantity
of
all
clothing
especially
for
infants
ought
to
be
regulated
by
these
three
or
four
rules
the
subject
of
this
chapter
is
one
of
so
much
importance
and
embraces
such
a
variety
of
items
that
it
will
be
more
convenient
both
to
the
reader
and
myself
to
consider
it
under
several
minor
heads
sec
the
buffon
in
his
natural
history
says
that
in
france
an
infant
has
hardly
enjoyed
the
liberty
of
moving
and
stretching
its
limbs
before
it
is
put
into
confinement
it
is
swathed
says
he
its
head
is
fixed
its
legs
are
stretched
out
at
full
length
and
its
arms
placed
straight
down
by
the
side
of
its
body
in
this
manner
it
is
bound
tight
with
cloths
and
bandages
so
that
it
can
not
stir
a
limb
indeed
it
is
fortunate
that
the
poor
thing
is
not
muffled
up
so
as
to
be
unable
to
breathe
all
swathing
except
with
a
single
bandage
around
the
abdomen
is
decidedly
unreasonable
injurious
and
cruel
i
do
not
pretend
that
the
remarks
of
buffon
are
fully
applicable
to
the
condition
of
infants
in
the
united
states
the
good
sense
of
the
community
nowhere
permits
us
to
transform
a
beautiful
babe
quite
into
an
egyptian
mummy
still
there
are
many
considerable
errors
on
the
subject
of
infantile
dress
which
in
the
progress
of
my
remarks
i
shall
find
it
necessary
to
expose
the
use
of
a
simple
band
can
not
be
objected
to
it
affords
a
general
support
to
the
abdomen
and
a
particular
one
to
the
the
last
point
is
one
of
great
importance
where
there
is
any
tendency
to
a
rupture
at
this
part
of
the
body
a
tendency
which
very
often
exists
in
feeble
children
and
without
some
support
of
this
kind
crying
coughing
sneezing
and
straining
in
any
way
might
greatly
aggravate
the
evil
if
not
produce
serious
consequences
but
in
order
to
afford
a
support
to
the
abdomen
in
the
best
manner
it
is
by
no
means
necessary
that
the
bandage
should
be
drawn
very
tight
two
thirds
of
the
nurses
in
this
country
greatly
err
in
this
respect
and
suppose
that
the
more
tightly
a
bandage
is
drawn
the
better
it
should
be
firm
but
yet
gently
yielding
and
therefore
a
piece
of
flannel
cut
bias
as
it
is
termed
or
obliquely
with
respect
to
the
threads
of
which
it
is
composed
is
the
most
appropriate
material
if
the
attention
of
the
mother
were
necessary
nowhere
else
it
would
be
indispensable
in
the
application
of
this
article
if
she
do
not
take
special
pains
to
prevent
it
the
erring
though
well
meaning
nurse
may
so
compress
the
body
with
the
bandage
as
to
produce
pain
and
uneasiness
and
sometimes
severe
colic
nay
worse
evils
than
even
this
have
been
known
to
arise
when
a
child
sneezes
or
coughs
or
cries
the
abdomen
should
naturally
yield
gently
but
if
it
is
so
confined
that
it
can
not
yield
where
the
band
is
applied
it
will
yield
in
an
unnatural
proportion
below
to
the
great
danger
of
producing
a
species
of
rupture
no
less
troublesome
than
the
one
which
such
tight
swathing
is
designed
to
prevent
but
besides
the
bandage
already
mentioned
no
other
restraint
of
the
body
and
limbs
of
a
child
is
at
all
admissible
the
creator
has
kindly
ordained
that
the
human
body
and
limbs
and
especially
its
muscles
or
moving
powers
shall
be
developed
by
exercise
confine
an
arm
or
a
leg
even
in
a
child
of
ten
years
of
age
and
the
limb
will
not
increase
either
in
strength
or
size
as
it
otherwise
would
because
its
muscles
are
not
exercised
and
the
fact
is
still
more
obvious
in
infancy
there
is
a
still
deeper
evil
on
all
the
limbs
are
fixed
two
sets
of
muscles
one
to
extend
the
other
to
draw
up
or
bend
the
limb
if
you
keep
a
limb
extended
for
a
considerable
time
you
weaken
the
one
set
of
muscles
if
you
keep
it
bent
you
weaken
the
other
this
weakness
may
become
so
great
that
the
limb
will
be
rendered
useless
there
are
cases
on
record
well
authenticated
where
children
by
being
obliged
to
sit
in
one
place
on
a
hard
floor
have
been
made
cripples
for
life
hundreds
of
others
are
injured
though
they
may
not
become
absolutely
crippled
i
repeat
it
therefore
their
dress
should
be
so
free
and
loose
that
they
may
use
their
little
limbs
their
neck
and
their
bodies
as
much
as
they
please
and
in
every
desired
direction
the
practices
of
confining
their
arms
while
they
lie
down
for
fear
they
should
scratch
themselves
with
their
nails
and
of
pinning
the
clothes
round
their
feet
are
therefore
highly
reprehensible
better
that
they
should
even
occasionally
scratch
themselves
with
their
nails
than
that
they
should
be
made
the
victims
of
injurious
restraint
who
would
think
of
tying
up
or
muffling
the
young
lamb
or
kid
and
even
the
young
plant
what
think
you
would
be
the
effect
if
its
leaves
and
branches
could
not
move
gently
with
the
soft
breezes
would
the
fluids
circulate
and
health
be
promoted
or
would
they
stagnate
and
a
morbid
sickly
and
dwarfish
state
be
the
consequence
those
whose
object
is
to
make
infancy
as
well
as
any
other
period
of
existence
a
season
of
happiness
will
not
fail
to
find
an
additional
motive
for
giving
the
little
stranger
entire
freedom
in
the
land
whither
he
has
so
recently
arrived
especially
when
he
seems
to
enjoy
it
so
much
who
can
be
so
hardened
as
to
confine
him
unless
compelled
by
the
most
pressing
necessity
sec
of
the
on
this
subject
a
writer
in
the
london
literary
gazette
of
some
eight
or
ten
years
ago
lays
down
the
following
general
directions
to
which
in
cold
weather
there
can
be
but
one
possible
objection
which
is
they
are
not
and
are
not
therefore
likely
to
be
followed
all
that
a
child
requires
so
far
as
regards
clothing
in
the
first
month
of
its
existence
is
a
simple
covering
for
the
trunk
and
extremities
of
the
body
made
of
a
material
soft
and
agreeable
to
the
skin
and
which
can
retain
in
an
equable
degree
the
animal
temperature
these
qualities
are
to
be
found
in
perfection
in
fine
flannel
and
i
recommend
that
the
only
clothing
for
the
first
month
or
six
weeks
be
a
square
piece
of
flannel
large
enough
to
involve
fully
and
overlap
the
whole
of
the
babe
with
the
exception
of
the
head
which
should
be
left
totally
uncovered
this
wrapper
should
be
fixed
by
a
button
near
the
breast
and
left
so
loose
as
to
permit
the
arms
and
legs
to
be
freely
stretched
and
moved
in
every
direction
it
should
be
succeeded
by
a
loose
flannel
gown
with
sleeves
which
should
be
worn
till
the
end
of
the
second
month
after
which
it
may
be
changed
to
the
common
clothing
used
by
children
of
this
age
the
advantages
of
such
a
dress
are
that
the
movements
of
the
infant
will
be
as
we
have
already
seen
free
and
unrestrained
and
we
shall
escape
the
misery
of
hearing
the
screams
which
now
so
frequently
accompany
the
dressing
and
undressing
of
almost
every
child
no
chafings
from
friction
moreover
can
occur
and
as
the
insensible
perspiration
is
in
this
way
promoted
over
the
whole
surface
of
the
body
the
sympathy
between
the
stomach
and
skin
is
happily
maintained
a
healthy
sympathy
of
this
kind
duly
kept
up
does
much
towards
preserving
the
stomach
in
a
good
state
and
the
skin
from
eruptions
and
sores
but
as
i
apprehend
that
christianity
is
not
yet
very
deeply
rooted
in
the
minds
and
hearts
of
parents
i
have
already
expressed
my
doubts
whether
they
are
prepared
to
receive
and
profit
by
advice
at
once
rational
and
physiological
still
i
can
not
help
hoping
that
i
shall
succeed
in
persuading
mothers
to
have
every
part
of
a
child
dress
perfectly
loose
except
the
band
already
referred
to
and
that
should
be
but
moderately
tight
common
humanity
ought
to
teach
us
better
than
to
put
the
body
of
a
helpless
infant
into
a
and
press
it
to
death
as
the
first
mark
of
our
attention
who
has
not
been
struck
with
a
strange
inconsistency
in
the
conduct
of
mothers
and
nurses
who
while
they
are
so
exceedingly
tender
towards
the
infant
in
some
points
as
to
injure
it
by
their
kindness
are
yet
almost
insensible
to
its
cries
of
distress
while
dressing
it
so
far
indeed
are
they
from
feeling
emotions
of
pity
that
they
often
make
light
of
its
cries
regarding
them
as
signs
of
health
and
vigor
there
can
be
no
doubt
i
confess
that
the
first
cries
of
an
infant
if
strong
both
indicate
and
promote
a
healthy
state
of
the
lungs
to
a
certain
extent
but
there
will
always
be
unavoidable
occasions
enough
for
crying
to
promote
health
even
after
we
have
done
all
we
can
in
the
way
of
avoiding
pain
they
who
only
draw
the
child
dress
the
tighter
the
more
it
cries
are
guilty
of
a
crime
of
little
less
enormity
than
murder
think
says
buchan
of
the
immense
number
of
children
that
die
of
convulsions
soon
after
birth
and
be
assured
that
these
its
cries
are
much
oftener
owing
to
galling
pressure
or
some
external
injury
than
to
any
inward
cause
this
same
writer
adds
that
he
has
known
a
child
which
was
seized
with
convulsion
fits
soon
after
being
swaddled
immediately
relieved
by
taking
off
the
rollers
and
bandages
and
he
says
that
a
loose
dress
prevented
the
return
of
the
disease
i
think
it
is
obvious
that
the
utmost
extent
to
which
we
ought
to
go
in
yielding
to
the
fashion
as
it
regards
form
is
to
use
three
pieces
of
clothing
the
shirt
the
petticoat
and
the
frock
all
of
which
must
be
as
loose
as
possible
and
before
the
infant
begins
to
crawl
about
much
the
latter
should
be
long
for
the
salve
of
covering
the
feet
and
legs
at
four
or
five
years
of
age
loose
trowsers
with
boys
may
be
substituted
for
the
petticoat
but
it
is
a
question
whether
something
like
the
frock
might
not
with
every
individual
be
usefully
retained
through
life
i
wish
it
were
unnecessary
in
a
book
like
this
to
join
in
the
general
complaint
against
tight
lacing
any
part
of
the
body
but
especially
the
chest
but
as
this
work
of
torture
is
sometimes
begun
almost
from
the
cradle
and
as
prevention
is
better
than
cure
the
hope
of
preventing
that
for
which
no
cure
appears
yet
to
have
been
found
leads
me
to
make
a
few
remarks
on
the
subject
as
it
has
long
been
my
opinion
that
one
reason
why
mothers
continue
to
overlook
the
subject
is
that
they
do
not
understand
the
structure
and
motion
of
the
chest
i
have
attempted
the
following
explanation
and
illustration
i
have
already
said
that
if
we
bandage
tightly
for
a
considerable
time
any
part
of
the
human
frame
it
is
apt
to
become
weaker
the
more
a
portion
of
the
frame
which
is
furnished
with
muscles
those
curious
instruments
of
motion
is
used
provided
it
is
not
the
more
vigorous
it
is
bind
up
an
arm
or
a
hand
or
a
foot
and
keep
it
bound
for
twelve
hours
of
the
day
for
many
years
and
think
you
it
will
be
as
strong
as
it
otherwise
would
have
been
facts
prove
the
contrary
the
chinese
swathe
the
feet
of
their
infant
females
and
they
are
not
only
small
but
weak
i
have
said
their
feet
are
smaller
for
being
bandaged
so
is
a
hand
or
an
arm
action
healthy
constant
action
is
indispensable
to
the
perfect
development
of
the
body
and
limbs
why
it
is
so
is
another
thing
but
so
it
is
and
it
is
a
principle
or
law
of
the
great
creator
which
can
not
be
evaded
more
than
this
if
you
bind
some
parts
of
the
body
tightly
so
as
to
compress
them
as
much
as
you
can
without
producing
actual
pain
you
will
find
that
the
part
not
only
ceases
to
grow
but
actually
dwindles
away
i
have
seen
this
tried
again
and
again
even
the
solid
parts
perish
under
pressure
when
a
person
first
wears
a
false
head
of
hair
the
clasp
which
rests
upon
the
head
at
the
upper
part
of
the
forehead
being
new
and
elastic
and
pressing
rather
closely
will
in
a
few
months
often
make
quite
an
indentation
in
the
cranium
or
bone
of
the
head
now
is
it
probable
nay
is
it
possible
that
the
lungs
especially
those
of
young
persons
can
expand
and
come
to
their
full
and
natural
size
under
pressure
even
though
the
pressure
should
be
slight
must
they
not
be
weakened
and
if
the
pressure
be
strong
as
it
sometimes
is
must
they
not
dwindle
away
we
know
too
from
the
nature
and
structure
of
the
lungs
themselves
that
tight
lacing
must
injure
them
many
mothers
have
very
imperfect
notions
of
what
physicians
mean
when
they
say
that
corsets
impede
the
circulation
by
preventing
the
full
and
undisturbed
action
of
the
lungs
they
get
no
higher
ideas
of
the
of
the
than
what
is
connected
with
bending
the
body
forward
and
backward
from
right
to
left
they
know
that
if
dressed
too
tightly
motion
is
not
so
free
as
it
otherwise
would
be
but
if
they
are
not
so
closely
laced
as
to
prevent
that
free
bending
of
the
body
of
which
i
have
been
speaking
they
think
there
can
be
no
danger
or
at
least
none
of
consequence
now
it
happens
that
this
sort
of
motion
is
not
that
to
which
physicians
refer
when
they
complain
of
corsets
strictly
speaking
this
bending
of
the
whole
body
is
performed
by
the
muscles
of
the
back
and
not
those
of
the
chest
the
latter
have
very
little
to
do
with
it
it
is
true
that
even
motion
ought
not
to
be
hindered
but
if
it
is
the
evil
is
one
of
little
comparative
magnitude
every
time
we
breathe
naturally
all
the
ribs
together
with
the
breast
bone
have
motion
the
ribs
rise
and
spread
a
little
outward
especially
towards
the
fore
part
the
breast
bone
not
only
rises
but
swings
forward
a
little
like
a
pendulum
but
the
moment
the
chest
is
swathed
or
bandaged
this
motion
must
be
hindered
and
the
more
in
proportion
to
the
tightness
on
this
point
those
persons
make
a
sad
mistake
who
say
that
a
busk
not
too
wide
nor
too
rigid
seems
to
correspond
to
the
supporting
spine
and
to
assist
rather
than
impede
the
efforts
of
nature
to
keep
the
body
erect
can
we
seriously
compare
the
offices
of
the
spine
with
those
of
the
ribs
and
suppose
that
because
the
former
is
fixed
like
a
post
at
the
back
part
of
the
lungs
therefore
an
artificial
post
in
front
would
be
useful
why
we
might
just
as
well
argue
in
favor
of
hanging
weights
to
a
door
or
a
clog
to
a
pendulum
in
order
to
make
it
swing
backwards
and
forwards
more
easily
we
might
almost
as
well
say
that
the
elbow
ought
to
be
made
firm
to
correspond
with
the
shoulders
and
thus
become
advocates
for
letting
the
stays
or
bandages
enclose
the
arm
above
the
elbow
and
fasten
it
firmly
to
the
side
indeed
the
consequences
in
the
latter
case
aside
from
a
little
inconvenience
would
not
be
half
so
destructive
to
health
as
in
the
former
the
ribs
where
they
join
to
the
back
bone
form
hinges
and
hinges
are
made
for
motion
but
if
you
fasten
them
to
a
post
in
front
of
what
value
are
the
hinges
if
mothers
ask
of
what
use
this
motion
of
the
lungs
is
it
is
only
necessary
to
refer
them
to
the
chapter
on
ventilation
in
which
i
trust
the
subject
is
made
intelligible
and
a
satisfactory
answer
afforded
but
i
might
appeal
to
facts
let
us
look
at
females
around
us
generally
do
their
countenances
indicate
that
they
enjoy
as
good
health
as
they
did
when
dress
was
worn
more
loosely
have
they
not
oftener
a
leaden
hue
as
if
the
blood
in
them
was
darker
are
they
not
oftener
than
formerly
as
they
advance
in
life
have
they
not
more
chronic
diseases
are
not
their
chests
smaller
and
weaker
and
as
the
doctrine
that
if
one
member
suffers
all
the
other
members
suffer
with
it
is
not
less
true
in
physiology
than
in
morals
do
we
not
find
other
organs
besides
the
lungs
weakened
surgeons
and
physicians
who
like
faithful
sentinels
have
watched
at
their
post
half
a
century
tell
us
moreover
that
if
these
foolish
and
injurious
practices
to
which
i
refer
are
tolerated
two
centuries
longer
every
female
will
be
deformed
and
the
whole
race
greatly
degenerated
physically
and
morally
those
with
whom
no
arguments
will
avail
are
recommended
to
read
the
following
remarks
from
the
first
volume
of
the
library
of
health
it
is
related
on
the
authority
of
macgill
that
in
tunis
after
a
girl
is
engaged
or
betrothed
she
is
then
for
this
purpose
she
is
cooped
up
in
a
small
room
and
shackles
of
gold
and
silver
are
placed
upon
her
ancles
and
wrists
as
a
piece
of
dress
if
she
is
to
be
married
to
a
man
who
has
discharged
despatched
or
lost
a
former
wife
the
shackles
which
the
former
wife
wore
are
put
on
the
new
bride
limbs
and
she
is
fed
till
they
are
filled
up
to
a
proper
thickness
the
food
used
for
this
custom
worthy
of
the
barbarians
is
called
which
is
of
an
extraordinary
fattening
quality
and
also
famous
for
rendering
the
milk
of
the
nurse
rich
and
abundant
with
this
and
their
national
dish
the
bride
is
literally
crammed
and
many
actually
die
under
the
spoon
we
laugh
at
all
this
and
well
we
may
but
there
are
customs
not
very
far
from
home
no
less
ridiculous
there
is
a
country
four
or
five
thousand
miles
westward
of
tunis
where
the
females
to
a
very
great
extent
are
emaciated
for
marriage
instead
being
fattened
this
process
is
begun
in
part
by
shackles
not
of
gold
and
silver
perhaps
but
of
wood
but
instead
of
being
put
on
loosely
and
causing
the
body
or
limbs
to
fill
them
they
are
made
to
compress
the
body
in
the
outset
and
as
the
size
of
the
latter
diminishes
the
shackles
are
contracted
or
tightened
as
with
the
eastern
so
with
the
western
females
many
of
them
die
under
the
process
though
a
far
greater
number
die
at
a
remote
period
as
the
consequence
of
it
sec
i
have
already
committed
myself
to
the
reader
as
favoring
the
use
of
soft
flannel
in
cold
weather
especially
for
children
who
are
not
yet
able
to
run
about
freely
in
the
open
air
the
advantages
of
an
early
use
of
this
material
at
least
for
are
numerous
the
following
are
a
few
of
them
flannel
next
to
the
skin
is
a
pleasant
flesh
brush
keeping
up
a
gentle
and
equable
irritation
and
promoting
perspiration
and
every
other
function
which
it
is
the
office
of
the
skin
to
perform
or
assist
in
performing
it
guards
the
body
against
the
cooling
effects
of
evaporation
when
in
a
state
of
profuse
perspiration
by
preventing
the
heat
of
the
body
from
escaping
too
rapidly
it
keeps
up
a
steadier
temperature
on
the
surface
than
any
other
known
substance
the
importance
of
the
last
consideration
is
greater
in
a
climate
like
our
own
than
elsewhere
but
there
are
limits
to
the
use
of
this
article
of
clothing
whenever
the
temperature
of
the
atmosphere
is
so
great
even
without
artificial
heat
that
we
no
longer
wish
to
retain
the
heat
of
the
body
by
the
clothing
then
all
flannel
should
be
removed
at
once
and
linen
should
be
substituted
taking
care
to
replace
the
flannel
whenever
the
temperature
of
the
atmosphere
as
indicated
by
the
thermometer
or
by
the
child
feelings
may
seem
to
require
it
it
should
also
be
kept
clean
there
is
a
very
general
mistake
abroad
on
this
subject
many
suppose
that
flannel
can
be
worn
longer
without
washing
than
other
kinds
of
cloth
on
the
contrary
it
should
be
changed
oftener
than
cotton
or
even
linen
because
it
will
absorb
a
great
deal
of
fluid
especially
the
matter
of
perspiration
which
if
long
retained
is
believed
to
ferment
and
produce
unhealthy
if
not
poisonous
gases
for
this
reason
too
flannel
for
children
clothing
should
be
white
that
it
may
show
dirt
the
more
readily
and
obtain
the
more
frequent
washing
although
it
is
for
this
very
reason
its
liability
to
exhibit
the
least
particles
of
dirt
that
it
is
commonly
rejected
one
caution
more
in
regard
to
the
use
of
flannel
may
be
necessary
with
some
children
owing
to
a
peculiarity
of
constitution
flannel
will
produce
eruptions
on
the
skin
which
are
very
troublesome
whenever
this
is
the
case
the
flannel
should
be
immediately
laid
aside
upon
which
the
eruptions
usually
disappear
if
parents
would
take
proper
pains
to
get
the
lighter
softer
kinds
of
flannel
for
this
purpose
and
be
particular
about
its
looseness
and
quantity
i
should
prefer
as
i
have
already
intimated
to
have
very
young
children
in
our
climate
wear
this
material
the
greater
part
of
the
year
excepting
perhaps
july
and
august
my
reasons
for
this
course
would
be
first
that
i
like
the
stimulus
of
soft
flannel
on
the
skin
if
changed
sufficiently
often
better
than
that
of
any
other
kind
of
clothing
secondly
cotton
is
so
liable
to
take
fire
that
its
use
in
the
nursery
and
among
little
children
seems
very
hazardous
thirdly
silk
is
not
quite
the
appropriate
material
as
a
general
thing
besides
being
too
expensive
and
fourthly
linen
is
not
warm
enough
except
in
except
therefore
in
july
and
august
and
in
cases
of
idiosyncracy
such
as
have
just
been
alluded
to
i
would
use
flannel
for
the
of
young
children
throughout
the
year
but
whenever
they
acquire
sufficient
strength
to
walk
and
run
and
play
much
in
the
open
air
i
would
gradually
lay
aside
the
use
of
all
flannel
even
in
winter
great
attention
however
must
be
paid
to
the
the
parent
who
guided
by
this
rule
should
keep
on
her
child
the
same
amount
of
flannel
and
of
the
same
thickness
from
january
to
june
and
then
on
the
first
of
july
should
suddenly
exchange
it
for
thin
linen
in
moderate
quantity
might
find
trouble
from
it
it
is
better
to
make
the
changes
more
gradually
otherwise
whatever
may
be
the
material
of
the
dress
the
child
will
be
likely
to
suffer
sec
the
quantity
of
clothing
used
by
different
individuals
of
the
same
age
in
the
same
climate
possessing
constitutions
nearly
alike
and
following
similar
occupations
is
so
different
as
to
strike
us
with
surprise
when
we
first
observe
the
fact
one
will
wear
nothing
but
a
coarse
linen
or
cotton
shirt
coarse
coat
waistcoat
and
pantaloons
and
boots
in
the
coldest
weather
he
never
unless
it
be
on
the
sabbath
puts
on
even
a
cravat
and
never
in
any
case
stockings
or
mittens
another
in
similar
circumstances
in
all
respects
constantly
wears
his
thick
stockings
flannel
wrapper
and
drawers
and
cravat
and
seldom
goes
out
in
cold
weather
without
mittens
and
an
overcoat
he
is
not
a
whit
warmer
indeed
he
often
suffers
more
from
the
cold
than
his
neighbor
who
dresses
in
the
manner
just
described
why
all
this
difference
it
is
no
doubt
the
result
of
habit
any
individual
may
accustom
himself
to
much
or
little
clothing
and
the
earlier
the
habit
is
begun
the
greater
is
its
influence
some
persons
observing
how
little
clothing
one
may
accustom
himself
to
use
and
yet
be
comfortable
have
told
us
that
so
far
as
mere
temperature
is
concerned
we
need
no
clothing
at
all
they
relate
the
story
of
the
scythian
and
alexander
alexander
asked
the
former
how
he
could
go
without
clothes
in
such
a
cold
climate
he
replied
by
asking
alexander
how
he
could
go
with
his
face
naked
habit
reconciles
us
to
this
was
the
reply
think
me
then
face
said
the
scythian
but
admitting
that
certain
individuals
and
even
a
few
rude
tribes
have
gone
without
clothing
did
they
therefore
follow
in
this
respect
the
intentions
of
nature
the
greatest
stickler
for
adhering
to
plan
can
not
prove
this
analogy
is
against
it
most
of
the
other
animals
even
in
hot
climates
are
furnished
with
a
hairy
covering
from
the
first
and
in
cold
climates
the
author
of
their
being
has
even
provided
them
with
an
increase
of
clothing
for
the
winter
their
fur
on
the
approach
of
cold
weather
not
only
becomes
whiter
and
therefore
conducts
the
heat
away
from
the
body
more
slowly
but
as
every
dealer
in
furs
well
understands
it
becomes
softer
and
thicker
and
yet
the
blood
of
the
furred
animals
of
cold
countries
is
as
warm
as
ours
if
not
warmer
the
inferences
which
it
seems
to
me
we
ought
to
make
from
this
are
that
if
other
animals
require
clothing
and
even
a
change
of
clothing
so
does
man
and
that
as
the
creator
has
left
him
to
provide
by
his
own
ingenuity
for
a
great
many
of
his
wants
instead
of
furnishing
him
with
instinct
to
direct
him
so
in
relation
to
dress
and
even
if
it
could
be
proved
that
dress
were
naturally
unnecessary
with
reference
to
temperature
i
should
still
defend
its
use
on
other
principles
the
few
speculative
minds
therefore
that
in
the
vagaries
of
their
fancy
but
never
in
their
practice
reject
it
are
not
to
be
regarded
the
principle
laid
down
in
the
commencement
of
the
chapter
on
temperature
is
the
great
principle
which
should
guide
us
in
regard
to
dress
but
although
we
should
always
keep
a
little
too
cool
rather
than
a
little
too
warm
it
is
by
no
means
desirable
to
be
cold
any
degree
of
chilliness
long
continued
interrupts
the
functions
which
the
skin
ought
to
perform
and
thus
produces
mischief
the
same
rules
in
this
respect
apply
to
eating
as
well
as
to
dress
it
is
better
to
eat
a
little
less
than
nature
requires
than
a
little
more
it
is
a
generally
received
opinion
however
that
mankind
frequently
at
least
in
this
country
eat
about
twice
as
much
as
health
requires
this
is
owing
to
habit
and
perhaps
the
power
of
the
latter
is
as
great
in
this
respect
as
in
regard
to
dress
the
great
point
in
regard
to
food
or
dress
is
to
right
and
observing
what
nature
requires
studying
at
the
same
time
the
testimony
of
others
to
endeavor
to
keep
within
the
bounds
she
has
assigned
it
has
already
been
more
than
intimated
that
if
the
nursery
be
kept
in
a
proper
temperature
a
single
loose
piece
of
dress
is
for
some
time
all
that
is
required
in
pursuance
of
this
principle
through
life
i
believe
few
persons
would
be
found
who
would
need
more
at
one
time
than
a
single
suit
of
woollen
clothes
even
in
the
severest
winters
of
our
northern
climate
i
have
always
observed
that
they
who
wear
the
greatest
amount
of
clothing
are
most
subject
to
colds
there
are
obvious
reasons
why
it
should
be
so
this
then
if
a
fact
is
one
of
the
strongest
reasons
in
favor
of
acquiring
a
habit
of
going
as
thinly
clad
as
we
possibly
can
and
not
at
the
same
time
feel
any
inconvenience
but
after
all
whether
it
be
winter
or
summer
we
must
vary
our
clothing
with
the
variations
of
the
weather
as
indicated
by
the
thermometer
and
our
own
feelings
sometimes
in
our
and
climate
it
may
be
necessary
to
vary
our
dress
three
or
four
times
a
day
some
cry
out
against
this
practice
as
dangerous
but
i
have
never
found
it
so
i
have
known
persons
who
made
it
a
constant
practice
and
i
never
found
that
they
sustained
any
injury
from
it
except
the
loss
of
a
little
time
and
the
increase
of
comfort
was
more
than
enough
to
compensate
for
that
there
is
one
thing
to
be
avoided
however
whether
we
change
our
clothing
our
linen
especially
twice
a
day
or
only
twice
a
week
which
is
sec
the
practice
of
putting
caps
on
infants
is
happily
going
by
and
perhaps
it
may
be
thought
unnecessary
for
me
to
dwell
a
single
moment
on
the
subject
but
as
the
practice
still
prevails
in
some
parts
of
the
country
it
may
be
well
to
bestow
upon
it
a
few
passing
remarks
many
mothers
have
not
considered
that
the
circulation
of
the
blood
in
young
infants
is
peculiarly
active
that
a
large
amount
of
blood
is
at
that
period
carried
to
the
head
that
in
consequence
of
this
the
head
is
proportionably
hotter
than
in
adults
and
that
from
this
source
arises
the
tendency
of
very
young
children
to
dropsy
in
the
head
and
other
diseases
of
this
part
of
the
system
but
these
are
most
undoubted
facts
hence
one
reason
why
the
heads
of
infants
should
be
kept
as
cool
as
possible
and
though
a
thin
cap
confines
less
heat
than
a
thick
head
of
hair
does
when
they
are
older
yet
they
are
less
able
to
bear
it
the
truth
is
that
nature
furnishes
a
covering
for
the
head
just
about
as
fast
as
a
covering
is
required
and
the
child
safety
will
permit
at
the
present
day
few
persons
will
probably
be
found
who
will
defend
the
utility
of
caps
any
longer
than
till
the
hair
is
grown
the
general
apology
for
their
use
after
this
period
and
indeed
in
most
instances
before
is
that
they
look
pretty
what
would
people
say
to
see
my
darling
without
a
cap
but
when
the
head
is
kept
from
the
first
totally
uncovered
the
hair
grows
more
rapidly
dandruff
and
other
scurfy
diseases
rarely
attack
the
scalp
catarrh
snuffles
and
other
similar
complaints
and
above
all
dropsy
in
the
head
seldom
show
themselves
and
the
period
of
cutting
teeth
that
most
dangerous
period
in
the
life
of
an
infant
is
passed
over
with
much
more
safety
nothing
but
custom
says
a
foreign
writer
can
reconcile
us
to
the
cap
with
all
its
lace
and
trumpery
ornaments
on
the
beautiful
head
of
a
child
and
i
would
ask
any
one
to
say
candidly
whether
he
thinks
the
children
in
the
pictures
of
titian
and
raffaelle
would
be
improved
by
having
their
heads
covered
with
caps
instead
of
the
silken
curls
the
adornment
of
nature
which
cluster
round
their
smiling
faces
if
there
were
no
other
reason
for
disusing
caps
for
infants
but
the
improvement
which
it
produces
in
the
of
the
child
i
would
maintain
that
this
is
a
sufficient
inducement
and
i
concur
with
him
fully
as
to
the
notion
now
i
hope
nearly
exploded
that
it
is
necessary
to
cover
up
the
open
of
the
head
as
it
is
called
nothing
can
be
more
idle
this
part
of
the
head
requires
no
more
covering
than
any
other
part
and
if
it
did
all
the
dress
in
the
world
could
not
affect
it
in
the
least
except
to
retard
the
growth
of
the
bones
which
in
due
time
ought
to
close
up
the
space
and
this
effect
anything
which
keeps
the
head
too
hot
might
help
to
produce
of
the
folly
of
wetting
the
head
with
spirits
or
any
other
medicated
lotions
and
of
making
daily
efforts
to
bring
it
into
shape
it
is
unnecessary
to
speak
in
the
present
chapter
sec
and
the
hats
worn
in
this
country
are
almost
universally
too
warm
but
if
it
is
a
great
mistake
in
adults
to
wear
thick
heavy
hats
it
is
much
more
so
in
the
case
of
children
the
infant
in
the
nursery
as
we
have
already
seen
needs
no
covering
of
the
kind
it
is
absolutely
necessary
that
the
head
should
be
kept
as
cool
as
possible
and
absolutely
dangerous
to
cover
it
too
warmly
at
a
later
period
however
the
danger
greatly
diminishes
because
the
circulation
of
the
blood
becomes
more
equal
and
does
not
tend
so
much
towards
the
brain
still
however
the
head
is
hotter
than
the
limbs
especially
the
hands
and
feet
and
i
can
not
help
thinking
that
the
hair
is
the
only
covering
which
is
perfectly
safe
either
in
childhood
or
age
except
in
the
sunshine
or
in
the
storm
there
may
be
there
probably
is
some
danger
in
going
without
hat
or
bonnet
in
the
hot
sun
though
i
have
known
many
children
and
some
grown
persons
who
were
constantly
exposed
in
this
way
and
yet
appeared
not
to
suffer
from
it
but
this
may
be
the
proper
place
to
state
that
we
are
ever
in
great
danger
of
deceiving
ourselves
on
this
subject
if
the
individuals
who
follow
practices
usually
regarded
as
pernicious
while
their
habits
in
other
respects
are
just
like
those
of
other
persons
around
them
who
have
similar
strength
of
constitution
if
these
individuals
i
say
were
wholly
to
escape
disease
through
life
or
if
they
were
to
be
so
much
more
free
from
it
and
live
to
an
age
so
much
greater
than
others
as
to
constitute
a
striking
and
obvious
difference
in
their
favor
we
might
then
safely
argue
that
the
practices
which
they
follow
are
at
least
without
dangers
if
not
of
obvious
advantage
but
when
we
see
them
beset
with
ills
like
other
people
it
is
not
safe
to
pronounce
their
habits
favorable
to
health
since
it
is
impossible
to
know
whether
some
of
the
ills
which
they
suffer
are
not
produced
by
them
these
remarks
are
applicable
to
the
disuse
of
any
covering
for
the
head
in
the
sun
and
in
the
rain
for
you
will
find
those
who
adopt
this
practice
from
early
infancy
footnote
i
say
from
early
infancy
because
we
may
adopt
the
best
habits
in
mature
years
after
our
constitutions
have
been
broken
up
by
error
and
vice
without
effecting
anything
more
than
to
keep
us
from
actually
sinking
at
once
indeed
in
most
cases
we
ought
not
to
expect
more
subject
to
as
many
diseases
as
those
around
them
with
similar
constitutions
but
with
habits
somewhat
different
and
as
our
diseases
are
generally
the
consequences
of
our
errors
in
one
way
or
another
it
is
impossible
to
say
with
certainty
that
some
of
them
might
not
have
arisen
from
exposure
of
the
head
i
should
not
hesitate
therefore
to
advise
all
mothers
to
put
a
light
hat
or
bonnet
on
the
heads
of
their
children
whenever
they
are
to
be
exposed
to
the
direct
rays
of
the
summer
sun
or
to
the
rain
and
as
we
can
not
always
foresee
when
and
where
these
exposures
will
arise
and
as
it
is
believed
that
these
coverings
if
light
will
never
be
productive
of
much
injury
while
we
are
abroad
in
the
open
air
it
will
follow
that
it
is
better
to
wear
than
to
omit
them
but
while
i
contend
for
their
use
as
consistent
with
health
and
sound
philosophy
i
must
not
be
understood
as
admitting
the
use
of
such
hats
as
are
worn
at
present
even
by
children
they
are
as
i
have
said
before
too
hot
what
should
be
substituted
i
am
unable
to
determine
but
until
something
can
be
supplied
which
would
not
be
half
so
oppressive
as
our
common
wool
hats
i
should
regard
it
as
the
lesser
evil
to
omit
them
entirely
the
danger
of
going
if
the
practice
is
commenced
early
we
know
from
the
customs
of
some
savage
nations
can
never
be
very
great
sec
for
the
the
same
reason
for
avoiding
the
use
of
any
covering
for
the
head
in
early
infancy
is
a
sufficient
reason
for
covering
the
feet
well
for
just
in
proportion
as
the
blood
is
sent
to
the
head
in
superabundance
and
keeps
up
in
it
an
undue
degree
of
heat
just
in
the
same
proportion
is
it
sent
to
the
feet
in
too
a
quantity
leaving
these
parts
liable
to
cold
now
it
is
a
fundamental
law
with
medical
men
that
the
feet
ought
to
be
kept
warmer
than
the
head
if
possible
especially
while
the
child
is
very
young
and
exposed
to
brain
diseases
so
long
therefore
as
children
are
young
and
unable
to
exercise
their
feet
stockings
ought
to
be
used
both
in
summer
and
winter
but
i
prefer
to
have
them
short
unless
long
ones
can
be
used
without
garters
everything
in
the
shape
of
a
garter
or
ligature
round
the
limbs
body
or
neck
of
a
child
except
a
single
already
mentioned
in
another
chapter
ought
forever
to
be
banished
it
has
often
been
objected
i
know
that
stockings
will
make
the
feet
tender
but
as
no
child
was
ever
hardened
by
and
severe
cold
applied
to
any
part
of
the
body
but
the
contrary
so
no
one
was
ever
made
more
tender
by
being
kept
moderately
warm
excess
of
heat
like
excess
of
cold
will
alike
weaken
either
children
or
adults
but
there
is
little
danger
of
heating
the
feet
and
legs
of
infants
too
much
during
the
first
year
of
infancy
it
is
also
said
that
stockings
are
apt
to
receive
and
retain
wet
but
as
i
shall
show
in
another
place
that
wet
clothes
should
be
frequently
changed
this
objection
would
be
equally
strong
against
wearing
coats
and
diapers
as
to
shoes
there
is
some
variety
of
opinion
among
medical
men
a
few
hold
that
they
cramp
the
feet
and
prevent
children
from
learning
to
walk
as
early
as
they
otherwise
would
if
it
were
best
for
children
that
they
should
learn
to
walk
as
early
as
possible
the
last
objection
might
have
weight
but
it
seems
to
me
not
at
all
desirable
to
be
in
haste
about
their
walking
indeed
i
greatly
prefer
to
retard
their
progress
in
this
respect
rather
than
to
hasten
it
as
to
the
first
objection
that
shoes
cramp
the
feet
too
much
nearly
its
whole
force
turns
upon
the
question
whether
they
are
made
of
proper
materials
or
not
there
is
no
need
of
making
them
of
or
any
other
thick
leather
the
soles
are
the
most
important
part
these
will
defend
the
feet
against
pins
needles
and
such
other
sharp
substances
as
are
usually
found
on
the
floor
and
the
upper
part
of
the
shoe
so
long
as
the
wearer
remains
in
the
nursery
may
be
made
of
the
softest
and
most
yielding
material
even
of
cloth
infants
shoes
should
always
be
made
on
two
lasts
one
for
each
foot
the
philosopher
locke
held
that
in
order
to
harden
the
young
their
shoes
ought
to
be
so
that
they
might
leak
and
let
in
water
whenever
they
came
near
it
there
may
be
and
probably
is
no
harm
in
having
a
child
wet
his
feet
occasionally
provided
he
is
soon
supplied
with
dry
stockings
again
but
it
is
hazardous
for
either
children
or
adults
to
go
too
long
in
wet
stockings
and
especially
to
sit
long
in
them
after
they
have
been
using
much
active
exercise
i
am
in
favor
of
good
substantial
shoes
and
stockings
for
people
of
all
ages
and
conditions
and
at
all
seasons
and
believe
it
entirely
in
accordance
with
sound
economy
and
the
laws
of
the
human
constitution
sec
the
custom
of
using
ten
or
a
dozen
pins
in
the
dressing
of
children
ought
by
all
means
to
be
set
aside
they
not
only
often
wound
the
skin
but
they
have
occasionally
been
known
to
penetrate
the
body
and
the
joints
of
the
limbs
so
many
of
these
dreadful
accidents
occur
and
where
no
accident
happens
so
much
pain
is
occasionally
given
by
their
sharp
points
to
the
little
sufferer
who
can
not
tell
what
the
matter
is
that
it
is
quite
time
the
practice
were
abolished
do
you
ask
what
can
be
substituted
the
following
mode
is
adopted
by
dewees
in
his
own
family
as
mentioned
in
his
work
on
the
physical
and
medical
treatment
of
children
at
page
the
and
the
petticoat
have
strings
and
not
a
single
pin
is
used
in
their
adjustment
the
little
shirt
which
is
always
made
much
larger
than
the
infant
body
is
folded
on
the
back
and
bosom
and
these
folds
kept
in
their
places
by
properly
adjusting
the
body
of
the
petticoat
so
far
not
a
pin
is
used
the
diaper
requires
one
but
this
should
be
of
a
large
size
and
made
to
serve
the
double
purpose
of
holding
the
folds
of
this
article
as
well
as
keeping
the
in
its
proper
place
the
latter
having
a
small
tag
of
double
linen
depending
from
its
lower
margin
by
which
it
is
secured
to
the
diaper
by
the
same
pin
should
an
extraordinary
display
of
best
and
tucker
be
required
upon
any
special
occasion
a
third
pin
may
be
admitted
to
ensure
the
of
the
waist
in
front
this
last
pin
however
is
applied
externally
so
that
the
risk
of
its
getting
into
the
body
is
very
small
even
if
it
should
become
displaced
the
writer
from
whom
the
last
two
paragraphs
are
taken
says
be
has
seen
needles
substituted
for
pins
and
relates
a
long
story
of
a
child
whose
life
was
well
nigh
destroyed
in
this
manner
it
underwent
months
of
ill
health
and
many
moments
of
excruciating
agony
before
the
cause
of
its
trouble
was
suspected
sometimes
its
distress
was
so
great
that
nothing
but
large
doses
of
laudanum
sufficient
to
stupify
it
could
afford
the
least
relief
at
last
a
tumor
was
discovered
by
the
attending
physician
near
one
of
the
bones
on
which
we
sit
and
a
needle
was
extracted
two
inches
long
the
needle
had
been
put
in
its
clothes
and
by
slipping
into
the
folds
of
the
skin
had
insinuated
itself
unperceived
into
the
child
body
it
is
pleasing
to
add
that
although
the
little
sufferer
had
now
been
ill
seven
or
eight
months
and
had
endured
almost
everything
but
death
fever
diarrhoea
and
the
most
excruciating
pain
it
soon
recovered
this
shocking
circumstance
is
enough
one
would
think
to
deter
every
mother
or
nurse
who
becomes
acquainted
with
it
from
using
needles
in
infants
clothes
happy
would
it
be
if
in
banishing
needles
they
would
contrive
to
banish
pins
also
and
adopt
either
the
plan
of
dewees
or
one
still
more
rational
sec
on
the
subject
of
changing
the
wet
clothing
of
a
child
there
is
a
strange
and
monstrous
error
abroad
which
is
that
by
suffering
them
to
remain
wet
and
cold
we
harden
the
constitution
the
filthiness
of
this
practice
is
enough
to
condemn
it
were
there
nothing
else
to
be
said
against
it
it
is
insisted
on
by
many
i
know
that
as
water
which
is
salt
when
it
is
applied
to
the
skin
and
suffered
to
remain
long
while
it
secures
the
point
of
hardening
the
child
prevents
all
possibility
of
its
taking
cold
it
hence
follows
that
wet
diapers
are
not
injurious
but
this
is
a
mistake
every
time
an
infant
is
allowed
to
remain
wet
we
not
only
endanger
its
taking
cold
but
expose
it
to
excoriations
of
the
skin
if
not
to
serious
and
dangerous
inflammation
in
short
if
frequent
changes
are
not
made
whatever
some
mothers
and
nurses
may
think
they
may
rest
assured
that
the
health
of
the
child
must
sooner
or
later
suffer
as
the
consequence
nor
is
it
enough
to
hang
up
a
diaper
by
the
fire
and
as
soon
as
it
is
dry
apply
it
again
it
should
be
clean
as
well
as
dry
let
us
not
be
told
that
it
is
troublesome
to
wash
so
often
everything
is
in
a
certain
sense
troublesome
everything
in
this
world
which
is
worth
having
is
the
result
of
toil
nothing
but
absolute
poverty
affords
the
shadow
of
an
excuse
for
neglecting
anything
which
will
promote
the
health
or
even
the
comfort
of
the
tender
infant
of
the
impropriety
and
danger
of
suffering
wet
clothes
to
dry
upon
us
i
shall
speak
elsewhere
as
well
as
of
the
evil
of
suffering
children
to
remain
dirty
their
skins
or
their
clothing
sec
on
the
dress
of
whatever
tends
to
disturb
the
growth
of
the
body
or
hinder
the
free
exercise
of
the
limbs
during
the
infancy
and
childhood
of
both
sexes
is
injurious
and
as
every
mother
has
the
control
of
these
things
i
have
thought
it
desirable
to
append
to
this
chapter
a
few
thoughts
on
the
particular
dress
of
each
sex
i
begin
with
that
of
boys
nothing
can
be
more
injurious
to
health
says
a
foreign
writer
than
the
tight
jacket
buttoned
up
to
the
throat
the
boots
and
the
stiff
stock
and
his
remarks
are
nearly
as
applicable
to
this
country
as
to
england
the
consequences
of
this
preposterous
method
of
dressing
boys
are
diminutive
manhood
deformity
of
person
and
a
constitution
either
already
imbued
with
disease
or
highly
susceptible
of
its
impression
no
part
of
the
modern
dress
of
boys
is
more
absurd
than
the
stiff
stock
or
thick
cravat
it
is
not
only
injurious
by
pressing
on
the
veins
and
preventing
the
blood
from
freely
passing
out
of
the
head
but
by
constantly
pressing
on
the
numerous
and
complex
muscles
of
the
neck
at
this
period
of
life
it
prevents
their
development
because
whatever
hinders
the
action
of
the
muscular
parts
hinders
their
growth
and
makes
them
even
appear
as
if
wasted
it
would
be
a
great
improvement
if
this
part
of
dress
were
wholly
discarded
and
when
is
there
so
appropriate
a
time
for
setting
it
aside
as
we
began
to
use
or
rather
while
we
are
under
the
more
immediate
care
of
our
mothers
the
use
of
jackets
buttoned
up
to
the
throat
except
in
cold
weather
is
objectionable
but
this
is
very
fortunately
going
out
of
fashion
boots
if
used
at
all
should
fit
well
to
this
there
can
be
no
possible
objection
what
the
writer
whom
i
have
quoted
referred
to
was
probably
the
tight
boot
worn
to
prevent
the
foot
from
being
large
and
unseemly
but
producing
as
tight
boots
inevitably
do
an
injurious
effect
upon
the
muscles
a
constrained
walk
and
corns
what
can
be
more
painful
than
to
see
little
boys
yes
boys
boys
neither
fifteen
nor
twenty
nor
walk
as
if
they
were
fettered
and
trussed
up
for
the
spit
unable
to
look
down
or
turn
their
heads
on
account
of
a
thick
stock
or
two
or
three
cravats
piled
on
the
top
of
each
other
and
only
capable
of
using
their
arms
to
dangle
a
cane
or
carry
an
umbrella
as
they
hobble
along
perhaps
on
a
hot
day
in
july
or
august
but
this
evil
you
who
are
mothers
have
it
very
generally
in
your
power
to
prevent
if
you
are
only
wise
enough
to
secure
that
ascendancy
over
your
children
minds
which
the
author
of
their
nature
designed
at
the
least
you
can
prevent
it
for
a
time
the
most
important
period
too
by
your
own
authority
this
you
will
not
need
any
urging
to
induce
you
to
do
if
you
ever
become
thoroughly
convinced
of
its
folly
sec
the
dress
of
the
same
general
principles
which
should
guide
the
young
mother
in
regard
to
the
dress
of
boys
are
equally
important
and
applicable
in
the
management
of
girls
the
whole
dress
should
as
much
as
possible
hang
loosely
from
the
shoulders
without
pressing
on
the
body
or
any
part
of
it
this
i
say
is
the
grand
point
to
be
aimed
at
and
this
is
the
only
great
principle
whatever
some
mothers
may
think
which
will
lead
to
true
beauty
of
person
and
gracefulness
of
gesture
there
is
however
a
slight
difference
to
be
made
between
the
dress
of
girls
and
that
of
boys
the
greater
delicacy
of
the
female
frame
requires
that
the
surface
of
the
body
should
be
kept
rather
warmer
as
well
as
better
protected
from
the
vicissitudes
of
the
atmosphere
but
is
this
the
fact
is
not
the
contrary
true
while
boys
in
the
winter
are
clad
in
warm
woollen
vestments
covering
every
part
of
their
trunk
many
portions
of
the
female
frame
and
especially
many
parts
of
their
limbs
are
left
so
much
exposed
that
in
cold
weather
you
scarcely
find
a
girl
abroad
who
appears
to
be
comfortable
nay
they
are
not
only
uncomfortable
abroad
but
at
home
and
if
i
were
to
present
to
mothers
in
detail
a
tenth
of
the
evils
which
their
daughters
suffer
from
not
adopting
a
warmer
method
of
clothing
i
should
probably
be
stared
at
by
some
and
laughed
at
by
others
all
this
too
without
speaking
of
going
out
of
warm
concert
rooms
theatres
ball
rooms
and
lecture
rooms
into
the
night
air
or
out
of
school
rooms
and
churches
to
walk
home
with
measured
and
stiffened
pace
lest
the
sin
unpardonable
of
walking
swiftly
or
running
that
active
exercise
which
health
requires
which
youthful
feeling
prompts
and
which
duty
ought
to
inspire
should
unwarily
be
committed
the
tremendous
evils
of
confining
the
lungs
have
been
adverted
to
at
sufficient
length
in
reference
to
that
general
subject
i
need
only
add
that
if
the
chest
be
not
duly
exercised
and
expanded
the
liver
the
lungs
the
stomach
digestion
absorption
circulation
and
perspiration
are
all
hindered
and
even
so
far
as
the
various
internal
organs
of
the
body
active
they
act
at
a
great
disadvantage
the
blood
which
they
work
up
is
bad
blood
and
must
be
so
as
long
as
the
lungs
do
not
have
free
play
hence
may
and
do
arise
all
sorts
of
diseases
especially
diseases
of
obstruction
and
such
as
are
often
very
difficult
of
removal
what
can
be
a
more
pitiable
sight
than
some
modern
girls
going
home
from
school
or
church
in
winter
thinly
clad
the
blood
is
all
driven
from
the
surface
upon
the
internal
organs
and
what
remains
is
so
loaded
with
carbon
which
the
lungs
ought
but
can
not
discharge
that
her
skin
has
a
leaden
hue
her
teeth

her
very
heart

her
panting
frozen
bosom
she
can
not

and
if
she

she

every

and

demands
till
she
perceives

and
she
will
never

till
she
has
studied
attentively
the
machinery
of
the
human
frame
and
especially
its
wonderful
covering
the
skin
is
pierced
with
little
openings
or
so
numerous
that
some
have
reckoned
them
at
a
million
to
every
square
inch
at
all
events
they
are
so
small
that
the
naked
eye
can
neither
distinguish
nor
count
them
and
so
numerous
that
we
can
not
pierce
the
skin
with
the
finest
needle
without
hitting
one
or
more
of
them
when
we
are
in
perfect
health
and
the
skin
clean
a
gentle
moisture
or
mist
continually
oozes
through
these
pores
this
process
is
called
and
the
moisture
which
thus
escapes
the
of
perspiration
perspiration
may
be
checked
in
two
ways
by
filth
on
the
skin
by
what
is
commonly
called
taking
cold
for
taking
cold
essentially
consists
in
chilling
the
skin
to
such
a
degree
as
to
stop
for
some
time
the
escape
of
this
moisture
most
persons
have
doubtless
observed
that
in
the
first
stages
of
a
cold
they
frequently
have
a
very
dry
skin
whereas
when
we
are
in
health
the
skin
usually
feels
moist
our
health
is
not
only
endangered
and
a
foundation
laid
for
fevers
rheumatisms
and
consumptions
by
stopping
the
pores
of
the
skin
with
dirt
or
anything
else
but
there
is
also
danger
from
another
and
a
very
different
source
the
blood
in
its
circulation
through
the
body
is
constantly
becoming
impure
and
as
it
thus
comes
back
impure
to
the
heart
is
as
constantly
sent
to
the
lungs
where
it
comes
in
close
contact
with
the
air
which
we
breathe
and
is
purified
but
this
same
purifying
process
which
goes
on
in
the
lungs
goes
on
too
if
the
skin
is
in
a
pure
free
healthy
condition
all
over
the
surface
of
the
body
if
it
is
not
if
the
skin
can
not
do
this
part
of
the
work
an
additional
burden
is
thus
laid
on
the
lungs
which
in
this
way
soon
become
so
overworked
that
they
can
not
perform
their
own
proportion
of
the
labor
and
whenever
this
happens
the
health
must
soon
suffer
the
strange
belief
that
dirt
is
healthy
has
much
influence
on
the
daily
practice
of
thousands
of
those
who
are
ignorant
of
the
human
structure
and
the
laws
which
govern
and
regulate
the
animal
economy
it
has
probably
originated
in
the
fact
that
those
children
who
are
allowed
to
play
in
the
dirt
are
often
as
healthy
and
even
healthy
than
those
who
are
confined
to
the
nursery
or
the
parlor
now
while
it
is
admitted
that
this
is
a
very
common
case
it
is
yet
believed
that
the
former
class
of
children
would
be
still
more
vigorous
than
they
now
are
if
they
were
kept
more
cleanly
or
were
at
least
frequently
washed
it
is
not
the
dirt
which
promotes
their
health
but
their
active
exercise
in
the
open
air
the
advantages
of
which
are
more
than
sufficient
to
compensate
for
the
injury
which
they
sustain
from
the
dirt
that
is
to
say
they
retain
in
spite
of
the
dirt
better
health
than
those
who
are
denied
the
blessings
of
pure
air
and
abundant
exercise
and
subjected
to
the
opposite
extreme
of
almost
constant
confinement
there
is
something
deceitful
after
all
in
the
ruddy
blooming
appearance
of
those
children
who
are
left
by
the
busy
parent
to
play
in
the
road
or
field
without
attention
to
cleanliness
if
this
were
not
so
how
comes
it
to
pass
that
they
suffer
much
more
not
only
from
chronic
but
from
acute
diseases
than
children
whose
parents
are
in
better
circumstances
i
am
the
more
solicitous
to
combat
a
belief
in
the
salutary
tendency
of
an
unclean
skin
because
i
know
it
prevails
to
some
extent
and
because
i
know
also
both
from
reason
and
from
fact
that
it
is
a
gross
error
it
is
however
true
that
years
sometimes
intervene
before
the
evil
consequences
of
dirtiness
appear
the
office
of
the
vessels
of
the
skin
being
interrupted
an
increase
of
action
is
imposed
on
other
parts
especially
on
those
internal
organs
commonly
called
glands
which
action
is
apt
to
settle
into
obstinate
disease
hence
at
least
when
aided
by
other
causes
often
arise
in
later
life
after
the
source
of
the
evil
is
forgotten
if
it
were
ever
suspected
rheumatism
scrofula
jaundice
and
even
consumption
there
is
a
strange
notion
abroad
that
the
of
the
earth
is
beneficial
especially
to
consumptive
persons
i
honestly
believe
however
that
it
is
more
likely
to
create
consumption
than
to
cure
it
besides
in
what
does
this
smell
consist
do
the
silex
the
alumine
and
the
other
earths
with
their
compounds
emit
any
odor
rarely
i
believe
unless
when
mixed
with
vegetable
matter
but
no
gases
necessary
to
health
are
evolved
during
the
decomposition
of
vegetable
matter
on
the
contrary
it
is
well
known
that
many
of
them
tend
to
induce
disease
i
am
thoroughly
persuaded
that
too
much
attention
can
not
be
paid
to
cleanliness
and
the
demand
for
such
attention
is
equally
imperious
in
the
case
of
those
who
cultivate
the
earth
or
labor
in
it
or
on
stone
during
the
intervals
of
their
useful
avocations
as
in
the
case
of
those
individuals
who
follow
other
employments
i
must
also
protest
against
the
doctrine
that
the
smell
or
taste
of
the
earth
much
less
a
coat
of
it
spread
over
the
surface
and
closing
up
for
hours
and
days
together
thousands
and
millions
of
those
little
pores
with
which
the
author
of
this
wondrous
frame
has
pierced
the
skin
can
have
a
salutary
tendency
the
opinion
has
been
even
maintained
that
uncleanly
habits
are
not
only
unfavorable
to
health
but
to
morality
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
he
who
neglects
his
person
and
dress
will
be
found
lower
in
the
scale
of
morals
other
things
being
equal
than
he
who
pays
a
due
regard
to
cleanliness
some
have
supposed
that
a
disposition
to
neglect
personal
cleanliness
was
indicative
of
genius
but
this
opinion
is
grossly
erroneous
and
has
well
nigh
ruined
many
a
young
man
i
am
far
from
recommending
any
degree
of
fastidiousness
on
this
subject
truth
and
correct
practice
usually
lie
between
extremes
but
i
do
and
must
insist
that
the
connection
between
cleanliness
of
body
and
purity
of
moral
character
is
much
more
close
and
direct
than
has
usually
been
supposed
but
to
return
to
the
more
immediate
effects
of
cleanliness
on
health
there
is
one
class
of
diseases
in
particular
which
in
an
eminent
degree
owe
their
origin
to
a
neglect
of
cleanliness
i
refer
to
the
bowel
complaints
so
common
among
children
during
summer
and
autumn
except
in
case
of
teething
the
use
of
unripe
fruits
or
the
of
those
which
are
in
themselves
excellent
it
is
probable
that
more
than
half
of
the
bowel
complaints
of
the
young
are
either
produced
or
greatly
aggravated
by
a
foul
skin
the
importance
of
washing
the
whole
body
in
water
will
be
insisted
on
in
the
chapter
on
bathing
it
is
therefore
unnecessary
to
say
anything
farther
on
that
subject
in
this
place
except
to
observe
that
whether
the
washings
of
the
body
be
partial
or
general
they
should
be
thorough
so
far
as
they
are
carried
there
are
thousands
of
children
who
in
pretending
to
wash
their
hands
and
face
will
do
little
more
than
wet
the
inside
of
their
hands
and
the
tips
of
their
noses
and
ears
unless
great
care
is
taken
few
things
are
more
important
than
suitable
changes
of
dress
there
are
those
who
from
principle
never
wear
the
same
but
one
day
without
washing
either
in
summer
or
winter
and
there
are
others
who
though
they
may
wear
an
article
without
washing
two
or
three
successive
days
take
care
to
change
their
dress
at
night
never
sleeping
in
a
garment
which
they
have
worn
during
the
day
it
is
a
very
common
objection
to
suggestions
like
these
that
they
will
do
very
well
for
those
who
have
wealth
but
not
for
the
poor
that
have
neither
the
time
nor
the
means
of
attending
to
them
how
can
they
change
their
clothes
every
day
we
are
asked
and
how
can
they
afford
to
have
a
separate
dress
for
the
night
there
must
be
retrenchment
in
some
other
matters
it
is
admitted
in
order
to
find
time
for
more
washing
or
money
to
pay
others
for
the
labor
the
poor
must
deny
themselves
a
few
things
which
they
now
suppose
if
they
have
ever
thought
at
all
on
the
subject
are
conducive
to
their
happiness
but
which
are
in
reality
either
useless
or
injurious
something
may
be
saved
by
a
reasonable
dress
as
i
have
already
shown
other
items
of
expense
which
might
be
spared
with
great
advantage
to
health
and
happiness
and
applied
to
the
purpose

savage
tribes
of

have
been
accustomed
to
plunge

this
is
done
for
the
purpose
of
washing
and
hardening
them
to
all
who
reason
but
for
a
moment
on
this
subject
the
danger
of
such
a
practice
must
be
obvious
so
sudden
a
change
from
a
temperature
of
nearly
of
fahrenheit
to
one
quite
low
perhaps
scarcely
must
and
does
have
a
powerful
effect
on

system
even
of

adult
but
how
much
more
on
that
of
a
tender
infant
we
may
form
some
idea
of
this
by
the
suddenness
and
violence
of
its
cries
by
the
sudden
contractions
and
relaxations
of
its
limbs
and
body
and
by
its
palpitating
heart

every
one
experience
may
also
remind
him
that
what
produces
at
best
a
momentary
pain
to
himself
can
not
otherwise
than
be
painful
to
the
infant
in
making
a
comparison
between
adults
and
infants
however
in
this
respect
we
should
remember
that
the
lungs
of
the
infant
do
not
get
into
full
and
vigorous
action
until
some
time
after
birth
and
that
on
this
account
the
hold
they
have
on
life
is
so
feeble
that
any
powerful
shock
and
especially
that
given
by
the
cold
bath
is
ten
times
more
dangerous
to
them
than
to
adults
or
even
to
infants
themselves
after
a
few
months
have
elapsed
it
is
surprising
to
me
that
so
sensible
a
writer
as
rousseau
generally
is
on
education
should
have
encouraged
this
dangerous
practice
and
still
more
so
that
many
fathers
even
now
blinded
by
theory
should
persist
in
it
notwithstanding
the
pleadings
of
the
mother
or
the
nurse
and
the
plainest
dictates
of
common
sense
and
common
prudence

nothing
is

which
shall
encourage
unthinking
nurses

in
setting
themselves
against
measures
which
have
been
prescribed
by
higher
authority
i
mean
the
physician
there
are
cases
of
this
kind
where
it
requires
all
the
resolution
which
a
father
uninterrupted
can
summon
to
his
aid
to
administer
a
dose
or
perform
a
task
on
which
he
knows
the
existence
of
his
child

be

when
the
thoughtless
entreaties
of
the
mother
or

are
interposed
it
makes
his
condition
most
distressing
mothers
in
such
cases
ought
to
encourage
rather
than
remonstrate
they
who
are
guilty
of
cruelty
and
perhaps
of
infanticide
a

into
cold

at

by
those

carry
them
so
far

that

known
death
itself
to
follow
the

of

in
this
way
i
believe
he
means
death
and
adds
with
great
confidence
that
he
has
repeatedly
seen
it
require
the
lapse
of
several
hours
before
reaction

dewees
on
children
p
we
need
not
hesitate
to
put
very
great
confidence
in
the
opinion
here
expressed
for
besides
being
a
close
and
just
observer
of
human
nature
has
had
the
direction
and
management
in
a
greater
or
less
degree
of
several
thousands
of
infants
nothing
indeed
in
the
whole
range
of
physical
education
seems
better
proved
than
that
while
some
few
infants
whose
constitutions
are
naturally
very
strong
are
invigorated
by
the
practice
in
question
others
in
the
proportion
of
hundreds
for
one
who
are
robust
are
injured
for
life
some
of
them
seriously
nor
will
spirits
added
to
the
water
make
any
material
difference
i
am
aware
that
there
is
a
very
general
notion
abroad
that
the
injurious
effects
of
cold
water
in
its
application
both
internally
and
externally
are
greatly
diminished
by
the
addition
of
a
little
spirit
but
it
is
not
so
does
the
addition
of
such
a
small
quantity
of
spirit
as
is
generally
used
in
these
cases
materially
alter
the
temperature
is
it
not
the
application
of
a
cold
liquid
to
a
heated
surface
still
can
we
make
anything
else
of
it
either
more
or
less
i
do
not
undertake
to
say
that
the
cold
bath
may
not
be
so
managed
in
the
progress
of
infancy
as
to
make
it
beneficial
especially
to
strong
constitutions
it
is
its
indiscriminate
application
to
all
children
without
regard
to
strength
of
constitution
or
any
other
circumstances
that
i
most
strenuously
oppose
of
its
occasional
use
under
the
eye
of
a
physician
and
by
parents
who
will
discriminate
i
shall
say
more
presently
our
first
duty
on
receiving
a
new
inhabitant
of
the
world
is
to
see
that
it
is
gently
but
thoroughly
washed
in
moderately
warm
soft
water
with
fine
soap
special
attention
should
be
paid
to
the
folds
of
the
joints
the
neck
the
arm
pits
for
rubbing
the
body
in
order
to
disengage
anything
which
might
obstruct
the
pores
or
irritate
or
fret
the
skin
nothing
can
be
preferable
to
a
piece
of
soft
sponge
or
flannel
though
the
operation
should
be
thorough
and
also
as
rapid
as
the
nature
of
circumstances
will
permit
all
harshness
should
be
avoided
when
finished
the
child
should
be
wiped
perfectly
dry
with
soft
flannel
while
the
washing
is
performed
the
temperature
of
the
room
should
be
but
a
few
degrees
lower
than
that
of
the
water
and
the
child
should
not
be
exposed
to
currents
of
cold
air
if
the
weather
is
severe
or
if
currents
of
air
in
the
room
can
not
otherwise
be
avoided
the
dressing
undressing
washing
may
be
done
near
the
fire
and
i
repeat
the
rule
it
should
always
be
done
with
as
much
rapidity
as
is
compatible
with
safety
here
will
be
seen
one
great
advantage
of
simplicity
in
the
form
of
dress
if
the
more
rational
suggestions
of
our
chapter
on
that
subject
are
attended
to
it
will
greatly
facilitate
the
process
of
washing
and
the
subsequent
daily
process
of
bathing
which
i
am
about
to
recommend
to
my
readers
this
washing
process
is
also
an
introduction
to
bathing
for
it
should
be
repeated
every
day
but
with
less
and
less
attention
to
the
washing
and
more
and
more
reference
to
the
bathing
how
long
the
child
should
stay
in
the
bath
must
be
left
to
experience
if
he
is
quiet
fifteen
minutes
can
never
be
too
long
and
i
should
not
object
to
twenty
if
otherwise
and
you
are
obliged
to
remove
him
in
five
minutes
or
even
in
three
still
the
bathing
will
be
of
too
much
service
to
be
dispensed
with
nothing
should
be
mixed
with
the
water
if
the
infant
is
healthy
except
a
little
soap
as
already
mentioned
some
are
fond
of
using
salt
but
it
is
by
no
means
necessary
and
may
do
harm
the
proper
hour
for
bathing
is
the
early
part
of
the
day
or
about
the
middle
of
the
forenoon
this
season
is
selected
because
the
process
manage
it
as
carefully
as
we
may
is
at
first
a
little
exhausting
as
the
child
grows
older
however
and
not
only
becomes
stronger
but
appears
to
be
actually
refreshed
and
invigorated
by
the
bath
it
will
be
advisable
to
defer
it
to
a
later
and
later
hour
by
the
time
the
babe
is
three
months
old
particularly
in
the
warm
season
the
hour
of
bathing
may
be
at
sunset
the
degree
of
heat
must
be
determined
in
part
by
observing
its
effect
on
the
child
and
in
part
by
a
thermometer
for
this
and
for
other
purposes
a
thermometer
as
i
have
already
more
than
hinted
is
indispensable
in
every
nursery
our
own
sensations
are
often
at
best
a
very
unsafe
guide
there
is
one
rule
which
should
always
be
observed
never
to
have
the
temperature
of
the
bath
below
that
of
the
air
of
the
room
if
the
thermometer
show
the
latter
to
be
the
bath
should
be
something
like
perhaps
with
feeble
children
rather
more
great
care
ought
always
to
be
taken
to
proportion
the
air
of
the
room
and
the
water
of
the
bath
to
each
other
if
for
example
the
temperature
of
the
room
have
been
for
some
time
unusually
warm
that
of
the
water
must
not
be
so
low
as
if
it
had
been
otherwise
on
the
contrary
if
the
room
have
been
for
a
considerable
time
rather
cool
the
bath
may
be
made
several
degrees
cooler
than
in
other
circumstances
but
in
no
case
and
in
no
circumstances
must
a
bath
intended
as
such
simply
be
so
warm
or
so
cold
as
to
make
the
child
uncomfortable
whether
the
temperature
be
or
it
is
hardly
necessary
to
add
that
in
bathing
a
young
child
the
vessel
used
for
the
purpose
should
be
large
enough
to
give
free
scope
to
all
the
motions
of
its
extremities
most
children
are
delighted
to
play
and
scramble
about
in
the
water
i
know
indeed
that
the
contrary
sometimes
happens
but
when
it
does
it
is
usually
i
do
not
say
because
the
countenances
of
those
who
are
around
express
fear
or
apprehension
for
it
is
surprising
how
early
these
little
beings
learn
to
decipher
our
feelings
by
our
very
countenances
some
of
our
readers
may
be
surprised
at
the
intimation
that
there
are
mothers
and
nurses
who
have
fears
or
apprehensions
in
regard
to
the
effects
of
the
warm
bath
but
others
and
it
is
for
such
that
i
write
this
paragraph
will
fully
understand
me
i
have
been
often
surprised
at
the
fact
but
it
is
undoubted
that
there
is
a
strong
prejudice
against
warm
bathing
in
many
parts
of
the
country
in
endeavoring
to
trace
the
cause
i
have
usually
found
that
it
arose
from
having
seen
or
heard
of
some
child
who
died
soon
after
its
application
i
have
had
many
a
parent
remonstrate
with
me
on
the
danger
of
the
warm
bath
and
this
too
in
circumstances
when
it
appeared
to
me
that
the
child
existence
depended
under
god
on
that
very
measure
perhaps
it
is
useless
in
such
cases
however
to
reason
with
parents
on
the
subject
the
medical
practitioner
must
do
his
duty
boldly
and
fearlessly
and
risk
the
consequences
but
as
i
am
writing
not
for
persons
under
immediate
excitement
but
for
those
that
may
be
reasoned
with
it
is
proper
to
say
that
in
medicine
the
warm
bath
is
so
often
used
in
extreme
cases
and
as
a
last
resort
even
when
death
has
already
grasped
or
is
about
to
fix
his
grasp
on
the
sufferer
that
it
would
be
very
strange
if
many
persons
die
just
after
bathing
but
that
the
bathing
itself
ever
produced
this
result
in
one
case
in
a
thousand
there
is
not
the
slightest
reason
for
believing
footnote
let
me
not
be
understood
as
intimating
that
the
general
neglect
of
bathing
of
which
i
complain
so
loudly
is
owing
to
this
unreasonable
prejudice
though
this
no
doubt
has
its
sway
on
the
contrary
i
believe
it
is
much
oftener
owing
to
ignorance
indolence
and
parsimony
there
are
many
more
whims
connected
with
bathing
as
with
almost
everything
else
which
it
were
equally
desirable
to
remove
some
nurses
and
mothers
think
that
if
the
child
skin
is
wiped
dry
after
bathing
it
will
impair
if
not
destroy
the
good
effects
of
the
operation
others
still
shocking
to
relate
will
even
put
it
to
bed
in
its
wet
clothes
this
too
from
principle
not
unlike
this
is
the
belief
very
common
among
adults
that
if
we
get
our
clothes
wet
even
our
stockings
we
must
by
all
means
suffer
them
to
dry
on
us
a
belief
which
in
its
results
has
sent
thousands
to
a
premature
grave
and
what
is
still
worse
made
invalids
for
life
of
a
still
greater
number
i
am
aware
that
in
rejecting
the
indiscriminate
cold
bathing
of
infants
i
am
treading
on
ground
which
is
rather
unpopular
even
with
medical
men
a
large
proportion
of
whom
seem
to
believe
that
the
practice
may
be
useful
but
i
am
not
alone
dewees
of
whose
large
experience
i
have
already
spoken
and
some
others
do
not
hesitate
to
avow
similar
sentiments
the
objections
of
dewees
to
cold
bathing
are
the
following
there
often
exists
a
predisposition
to
disease
which
cold
bathing
is
sure
to
rouse
to
action
or
if
the
disease
have
already
begun
to
affect
the
system
the
bath
is
sure
to
aggravate
it
some
children
have
such
feeble
constitutions
that
they
are
sure
to
be
permanently
weakened
by
it
rather
than
invigorated
to
those
in
whom
there
is
the
tendency
of
a
large
quantity
of
blood
to
the
head
lungs
liver
it
is
injurious
in
some
the
shock
produces
a
species
of
syncope
or
catalepsy
the
as
shown
by
the
heat
which
follows
the
cold
bath
is
in
some
cases
so
great
as
to
produce
a
degree
of
fever
and
consequent
debility
it
never
answers
the
purposes
of
cleanliness
one
great
object
of
bathing
so
well
as
the
warm
bath
it
is
always
unpleasant
or
painful
to
the
child
especially
at
first
it
sometimes
produces
severe
pain
in
the
bowels
this
is
a
very
formidable
list
of
objections
and
certainly
deserves
consideration
there
is
one
statement
made
by
in
the
progress
of
his
remarks
on
this
subject
in
which
i
do
not
concur
he
says
the
object
of
all
bathing
is
to
remove
impurities
arising
from
dust
perspiration
from
the
surface
that
the
skin
may
not
be
obstructed
in
the
performance
of
its
proper
offices
but
the
object
of
cold
bathing
with
many
is
to
consequently
it
is
not
true
that
cleanliness
is
the
if
he
means
even
that
cleanliness
is
the
only
object
of
all
bathing
i
shall
still
be
compelled
to
dissent
if
the
cold
bath
could
be
used
always
by
and
with
the
direction
of
a
skilful
physician
i
believe
its
occasional
use
might
be
rendered
salutary
and
although
as
it
is
now
commonly
used
i
believe
its
effects
are
almost
anything
but
salutary
i
do
not
deny
that
if
its
use
were
cautiously
and
gradually
begun
and
judiciously
conducted
it
might
be
the
means
of
making
children
who
are
already
robust
still
more
hardy
and
healthy
than
before
and
better
able
to
resist
those
sudden
changes
of
temperature
so
common
in
our
climate
and
so
apt
to
produce
cold
fever
and
consumption
cold
bathing
in
the
hands
of
those
who
are
ignorant
of
the
laws
of
the
human
frame
and
such
unfortunately
and
unaccountably
most
fathers
and
mothers
are
i
can
not
help
regarding
as
a
highly
dangerous
weapon
and
therefore
it
is
that
in
view
of
the
whole
subject
i
can
not
recommend
its
general
and
indiscriminate
use
if
there
are
individuals
however
who
are
determined
to
employ
it
in
the
case
of
their
more
vigorous
children
and
without
the
advice
or
direction
of
their
family
physician
i
beg
them
to
attend
to
the
following
rules
or
principles
expressed
as
briefly
as
possible
in
no
ordinary
case
whatever
is
the
cold
bath
useful
unless
it
is
succeeded
by
that
degree
of
warmth
on
the
surface
of
the
body
which
is
usually
called
a
this
is
a
leading
and
important
principle
the
contrary
that
is
the
injurious
effects
of
cold
bathing
its
bad
effects
i
mean
are
shown
by
the
skin
remaining
pale
and
shrivelled
after
coming
out
of
the
bath
by
its
blue
appearance
and
by
its
coldness
as
well
as
by
a
sunken
state
of
the
eyes
and
much
general
languor
to
secure
this
point
i
mean
the
glow
it
is
indispensably
important
to
begin
the
use
of
cold
water
gradually
that
is
to
use
it
at
first
of
so
high
a
temperature
as
to
produce
only
a
slight
sensation
of
cold
and
to
take
special
care
that
the
skin
be
immediately
wiped
very
dry
and
the
temperature
of
the
room
be
quite
as
high
as
usual
afterward
the
water
may
be
cooled
gradually
from
week
to
week
though
never
more
than
a
degree
or
two
at
once
it
will
probably
be
unsafe
to
commence
this
practice
of
cold
bathing
even
in
the
case
of
the
most
robust
children
until
they
are
at
least
six
months
of
age
the
appropriate
season
will
be
the
middle
of
the
forenoon
the
hour
when
the
system
is
usually
the
most
vigorous
and
at
which
we
shall
be
most
likely
to
secure
a
reaction
at
first
twice
or
three
times
a
week
are
as
often
as
it
will
be
safe
to
repeat
it
some
writers
recommend
it
twice
a
day
but
once
is
enough
under
any
ordinary
circumstances
the
method
at
first
is
to
give
the
infant
a
single
plunge
afterward
when
he
becomes
older
and
more
inured
to
it
he
may
be
plunged
several
times
in
succession
on
taking
him
out
of
the
bath
the
skin
should
be
wiped
perfectly
dry
as
in
the
case
of
the
warm
bath
and
with
the
same
or
an
increased
degree
of
attention
to
other
circumstances
the
temperature
of
the
room
the
avoiding
currents
of
air
he
should
next
be
put
in
a
soft
warm
blanket
and
be
kept
for
some
time
in
a
state
of
gentle
motion
and
after
a
little
time
should
be
dressed
i
have
already
mentioned
the
importance
of
avoiding
the
manifestation
of
fear
when
we
bathe
a
child
and
the
caution
is
particularly
necessary
in
the
administration
of
the
cold
bath
some
writers
even
recommend
that
during
the
whole
process
of
undressing
bathing
exercising
and
dressing
singing
should
be
employed
there
is
philosophy
in
this
advice
and
it
is
easily
tried
but
i
can
not
speak
of
it
from
experience
there
is
one
thing
which
may
serve
to
calm
our
apprehensions
if
we
have
any
of
danger
which
is
that
though
the
child
lungs
are
feeble
at
first
from
their
not
having
been
like
the
heart
accustomed
to
previous
action
yet
when
they
get
fairly
into
motion
and
action
and
the
child
is
a
few
months
old
they
are
probably
as
strong
if
not
stronger
in
proportion
than
those
of
adults
bathing
in
cold
water
should
never
be
performed
immediately
after
a
full
meal
neither
is
it
desirable
to
go
to
the
contrary
extreme
and
bathe
when
the
stomach
has
been
long
empty
nor
when
the
child
mental
or
bodily
powers
are
more
than
usually
exhausted
by
fatigue
although
i
have
given
these
rules
for
those
who
are
determined
to
use
the
cold
bath
with
their
children
yet
for
fear
i
shall
be
misunderstood
i
must
be
suffered
to
repeat
in
this
place
that
uninformed
as
people
generally
are
in
regard
to
physiology
i
can
not
advise
even
its
moderate
use
on
the
contrary
i
would
gladly
dissuade
from
it
as
most
likely
in
the
way
it
would
inevitably
be
used
to
do
more
harm
than
good
there
is
no
sort
of
objection
to
what
might
be
called
local
bathing
with
cold
water
if
the
child
head
is
hot
at
any
time
the
temples
and
indeed
the
whole
upper
part
of
the
head
may
be
very
properly
wet
with
moderately
cold
water
taking
care
to
avoid
wetting
the
clothes
but
avoid
by
all
means
the
common
but
foolish
practice
of
putting
spirits
in
the
water
a
of
cold
water
can
not
be
too
early
put
into
the
mouth
of
the
infant
the
object
is
to
cleanse
or
rinse
the
mouth
and
the
process
may
be
aided
by
wiping
it
out
with
a
piece
of
soft
linen
rag
if
a
part
or
all
of
the
water
should
be
swallowed
no
harm
will
be
done
this
practice
commenced
almost
as
soon
as
children
are
born
has
saved
many
a
sore
mouth
there
are
other
forms
of
bathing
besides
those
already
mentioned
among
which
are
the
shower
bath
the
vapor
bath
and
the
medicated
bath
the
shower
bath
for
which
purpose
the
water
is
commonly
used
cold
is
but
poorly
adapted
to
the
wants
of
infants
the
shock
is
much
greater
than
the
common
cold
bath
and
more
apt
to
frighten
and
fear
is
unfavorable
to
reaction
or
the
production
of
a
genial
glow
the
vapor
bath
is
much
better
and
probably
has
quite
as
good
an
effect
as
the
common
warm
bath
the
trouble
and
expense
of
procuring
the
necessary
apparatus
is
somewhat
greater
however
as
a
mere
bathing
tub
costs
but
little
and
can
be
made
by
every
father
who
possesses
common
ingenuity
but
whatever
may
be
the
expense
it
is
indispensable
in
every
family
and
whenever
the
pores
of
the
skin
are
obstructed
a
vapor
bathing
apparatus
is
equally
desirable
the
medicated
vapor
bath
is
sometimes
used
but
i
am
not
now
treating
of
infants
who
are
sick
but
of
those
who
are
in
a
state
of
health
the
common
warm
bath
is
sometimes
medicated
by
putting
in
salt
this
of
course
renders
the
water
more
stimulating
to
the
skin
but
except
when
the
perspiration
is
checked
or
the
skin
peculiarly
inactive
from
some
other
cause
in
other
words
unless
we
are
sick
it
is
seldom
expedient
to
use
it
there
is
one
substitute
for
the
bathing
tub
in
the
case
of
the
cold
bath
i
refer
to
the
use
of
a
wet
cloth
or
sponge
applied
rapidly
to
the
whole
surface
of
the
body
when
this
is
done
the
skin
should
be
wiped
thoroughly
dry
immediately
afterwards
as
in
the
case
of
complete
immersion
the
application
of
either
a
cloth
or
a
sponge
filled
with
warm
water
to
the
skin
in
this
manner
even
if
continued
for
several
minutes
together
is
less
efficacious
than
a
continuous
immersion
i
repeat
it
no
family
ought
to
be
without
conveniences
for
bathing
in
warm
water
daily
i
speak
now
of
every
member
of
the
family
young
and
old
as
well
as
the
infant
and
i
refer
particularly
to
the
summer
season
though
i
do
not
think
the
practice
ought
to
be
wholly
discontinued
during
the
winter
it
will
still
be
objected
that
this
care
of
and
attention
to
the
young
in
reference
to
health
this
provision
for
bathing
daily
and
care
to
see
that
it
is
performed
can
never
be
afforded
by
the
laboring
portion
of
the
community
but
i
shall
as
strenuously
insist
on
the
contrary
and
trust
i
shall
in
the
sequel
produce
reasons
which
will
be
satisfactory
the
great
difficulty
is
to
convince
parents
that
these
things
are
vastly
more
productive
of
health
and
happiness
to
their
children
more
truly
necessaries
than
a
great
many
things
for
which
they
now
expend
their
time
and
money
there
is
and
always
has
been
except
perhaps
among
the
jews
in
the
earliest
periods
of
the
history
of
that
wonderful
nation
a
strange
disposition
to
overlook
the
happiness
of
the
young
it
is
not
necessary
to
represent
this
dereliction
as
peculiar
to
modern
times
for
we
find
traces
of
the
same
thing
thousands
of
years
ago
the
roman
emperors
dioclesian
in
particular
could
make
provision
for
bathing
to
an
extent
which
now
astonishes
us
but
for
whom
for
whom
i
repeat
it
was
incurred
the
enormous
expense
of
fitting
up
and
keeping
in
repair
accommodations
for
bathing
at
once
people
for
adults
and
for
adults
alone
i
do
not
say
that
children
were
not
admitted
in
any
case
but
i
say
they
were
not
contemplated
in
these
arrangements
nothing
was
done
not
a
single
thing
that
would
not
have
been
done
had
there
been
no
child
under
ten
years
of
age
in
the
whole
empire
and
what
better
than
this
do
we
now
we
make
provision
for
the
happiness
of
the
adult
the
most
indigent
person
will
find
time
and
money
to
spend
for
the
gratification
of
his
own
senses
his
pride
or
his
curiosity
but
his
children
they
may
be
overlooked
or
if
he
has
an
eye
to
the
future
happiness
of
his
child
he
conceives
that
he
is
promoting
it
in
the
best
possible
degree
by
endeavoring
to
lay
up
a
few
dollars
for
his
use
after
his
character
is
formed
at
a
period
as
it
too
often
happens
when
money
will
do
him
little
good
since
it
can
neither
purchase
health
peace
of
mind
nor
reputation
far
be
it
from
me
to
say
that
the
poor
ground
into
the
dust
as
they
are
by
the
force
of
circumstances
operating
with
their
own
concurrence
to
make
them
ignorant
vicious
or
miserable
can
do
for
their
children
all
that
is
desirable
by
no
means
but
they
have
it
in
their
power
to
do
much
more
than
they
are
at
present
doing
they
have
it
in
their
power
at
least
to
use
the
same
good
sense
in
the
management
of
the
human
being
that
they
do
in
that
of
a
pig
a
calf
or
a
colt
or
even
a
young
vegetable
no
parent
let
him
be
ever
so
poor
is
found
in
the
habit
of
neglecting
either
of
these
in
proportion
to
its
infancy
and
of
exerting
himself
only
in
proportion
as
it
grows
older
common
sense
tells
him
that
the
contrary
is
the
true
course
that
however
poor
he
may
be
he
will
be
still
poorer
if
he
do
not
take
special
pains
with
the
young
animal
to
rear
it
and
with
the
young
vegetable
to
give
it
the
right
direction
by
keeping
down
the
weeds
and
pruning
and
watering
it
and
i
say
again
that
however
deserving
of
censure
the
wealthy
of
a
christian
community
may
be
in
not
directing
the
ignorant
and
vicious
into
the
right
path
and
in
not
expending
more
of
their
wealth
on
those
who
are
poor
in
elevating
their
minds
and
their
manners
and
promoting
their
health
still
the
latter
are
inexcusable
for
their
present
neglect
of
their
infant
offspring
while
they
would
not
think
of
neglecting
on
the
same
principle
the
offspring
of
their
domestic
animals

of
an
infant
during
the

months
of
its

that
it
seems
almost
unnecessary
to
repeat
the
fact
and
yet
the
violations
of
this
rule
are
so
numerous
and
constant
as
to
require
a
few
passing
remarks
there
are
some
mothers
who
seem
to
have
a
perfect
hatred
of
children
and
if
they
can
find
any
plausible
apology
for
neglecting
to
nurse
them
they
will
few
indeed
will
publicly
acknowledge
a
state
of
feeling
so
unnatural
but
there
are
some
even
of
such
on
the
latter
all
argument
would
i
fear
be
utterly
lost
of
the
former
there
may
be
hope
they
tell
us
and
they
are
often
sustained
by
those
around
them
that
it
is
very
inconvenient
to
be
so
confined
to
a
child
that
they
can
not
leave
home
for
a
little
while
can
it
be
their
duty
for
in
these
days
when
virtue
and
religion
and
everything
good
are
so
highly
complimented
no
people
are
more
ready
to
talk
of
than
they
who
have
the
least
regard
to
it
can
it
be
their
duty
they
ask
to
exclude
themselves
from
the
pleasures
and
comforts
of
social
life
for
half
or
two
thirds
of
their
most
active
and
happy
years
ought
they
not
to
go
abroad
at
least
occasionally
but
if
so
and
their
children
have
no
other
source
of
dependence
must
they
not
suffer
is
it
not
better
therefore
that
they
should
be
early
accustomed
to
other
food
for
a
part
of
the
time
besides
they
may
be
sick
and
then
the
child
must
rely
on
others
and
will
it
not
be
useful
to
accustom
it
early
to
do
so
perhaps
few
mothers
are
conscious
that
this
train
of
reasoning
passes
through
their
minds
but
that
something
like
it
is
often
made
the
occasion
of
substituting
food
which
is
less
proper
for
that
furnished
by
divine
providence
there
can
not
be
a
doubt
and
the
mischief
is
that
she
who
has
gone
so
far
will
not
scruple
ere
long
to
go
farther
and
strange
and
unnatural
as
it
may
seem
that
mothers
should
turn
over
their
children
to
be
nursed
wholly
by
others
in
order
to
get
rid
of
the
inconvenience
of
nursing
them
at
their
own
bosoms
it
is
only
carrying
out
to
its
fullest
extent
and
reducing
to
practice
the
train
of
reasoning
mentioned
above
nor
is
it
necessary
that
i
should
stop
here
to
denounce
a
course
of
conduct
so
unchristian
and
savage
i
know
it
is
very
common
in
some
countries
and
those
american
mothers
who
ape
the
other
eastern
fashions
or
countenance
their
sons
and
daughters
in
doing
it
will
not
be
slow
to
imitate
this
also
especially
as
it
is
a
very
fashion
and
i
question
whether
i
shall
succeed
in
reasoning
them
out
of
it
habit
both
of
thought
and
action
is
exceedingly
powerful
i
will
therefore
confine
myself
chiefly
to
those
efforts
at
prevention
from
which
much
more
is
to
be
hoped
in
the
present
state
of
society
than
from
direct
attempts
at
cure
it
will
be
soon
enough
to
leave
a
child
with
another
person
when
the
mother
is
actually
sick
or
unavoidably
absent
or
when
some
other
adequate
cause
is
known
to
exist
we
are
to
be
governed
in
these
and
similar
cases
by
general
rules
and
not
by
exceptions
the
general
rule
in
the
present
case
is
that
mothers
can
nurse
their
own
children
and
if
they
have
the
proper
disposition
that
they
can
do
it
uninterruptedly
but
those
who
are
so
ready
to
become
counsellors
on
these
occasions
will
tell
us
perhaps
that
the
child
must
be
fed
to
spare
the
mother
that
is
to
say
nursing
weakens
the
mother
and
the
child
must
be
taken
away
a
part
of
the
time
to
save
her
strength
now
it
may
safely
be
doubted
whether
the
process
of
nursing
in
itself
considered
does
weaken
at
all
the
author
of
nature
has
made
provision
for
the
secretion
formation
of
the
milk
whether
the
child
receives
it
or
not
if
it
is
not
taken
by
the
child
or
drawn
off
in
some
other
way
one
of
two
things
must
follow
either
it
must
be
taken
up
by
what
are
called
absorbent
vessels
and
carried
into
the
circulation
and
chiefly
thrown
out
of
the
system
as
waste
matter
or
it
will
prove
a
source
of
irritation
if
not
of
inflammation
to
the
organs
themselves
which
secrete
it
in
both
cases
the
strength
of
the
mother
is
quite
as
likely
to
be
taxed
as
if
the
child
received
the
milk
in
the
way
that
nature
intended
besides
on
this
very
principle
the
plan
of
saving
a
mother
strength
by
requiring
another
to
nurse
for
her
is
but
saying
that
we
will
weaken
one
person
to
save
another
or
if
we
feed
the
child
to
spare
its
mother
what
is
this
in
practice
but
to
say
that
the
works
of
the
creator
are
very
imperfect
and
that
he
has
thrown
upon
the
mass
of
mankind
a
task
to
which
they
are
not
equal
for
the
mass
of
mankind
are
poor
and
the
poor
having
neither
the
means
nor
the
time
to
escape
the
duties
in
question
must
submit
to
them
while
their
more
wealthy
neighbors
escape
but
it
is
idle
to
defend
customs
so
monstrous
they
admit
of
no
defence
that
has
the
slightest
claim
to
solidity
the
general
rule
then
is
that
mothers
should
nurse
their
own
children
sec
of
the
originally
it
was
not
my
intention
to
give
directions
in
this
volume
in
regard
to
the
food
drink
of
the
mother
while
nursing
but
repeated
solicitations
on
this
point
have
led
me
to
the
conclusion
that
a
few
general
principles
may
be
very
properly
introduced
the
future
health
and
even
the
moral
of
the
child
depend
much
more
on
the
proper
management
of
the
mother
herself
than
is
usually
supposed
how
indeed
can
it
be
other
wise
how
can
the
mother
blood
be
constantly
irritated
with
improper
food
and
drink
without
rendering
the
milk
so
and
how
can
a
child
draw
daily
and
hourly
from
this
feverish
fountain
without
being
affected
not
only
in
his
physical
frame
but
in
his
very
temper
and
feelings
it
is
not
enough
that
we
adopt
the
principles
already
insisted
on
by
some
of
our
wisest
medical
men
and
even
by
one
or
two
medical
societies
footnote
those
of
connecticut
and
new
hampshire
that
children
in
this
way
often
acquire
a
propensity
for
exciting
drinks
that
may
end
in
their
downright
intemperance
what
if
it
should
not
in
every
case
proceed
quite
so
far
as
to
make
the
child
a
drunkard
if
it
but
lays
the
foundation
of
a
constitutional
fondness
for
it
tends
to
disease
indeed
that
in
itself
is
a
disease
and
one
too
which
is
destroying
more
persons
every
year
than
the
cholera
or
even
the
consumption
consumption

at
most

her

to
be
and
therefore
only
the
more
dangerous
a
foe
does
not
fail
to
slay
every
year
directly
or
indirectly
its
hundreds
of
thousands
at
least
this
is
my
own
opinion
why
where
can
you
find
the
individual
who
is
not
a
slave
to
this
perpetual
rage
within
this
perpetual
cry
who
will
show
us
any
physical
good
who
in
this
land
of
abundance
will
eat
or
drink
plain
things
who
will
eat
simple
bread
meat
potatoes
rice
pudding
apples
or
drink
simple
water
a
few
instances
may
be
found
of
late
in
which
people
confine
themselves
to
simple
water
for
drink
but
they
are
rather
rare
and
no
wonder
they
be
rare
so
long
as
an
unnatural
thirst
is
kept
up
everywhere
by
the
most
exciting
and
most
strange
mixtures
of
food
where
i
again
ask
is
the
person
who
will
eat
and
relish
plain
bread
plain
meat
plain
puddings
certainly
not
in
the
nursery
no
young
mother
scarcely
one
i
mean
will
for
a
single
meal
confine
herself
to
a
piece
of
bread
the
sweetest
and
best
food
in
the
whole
world
unless
it
is
hot
or
toasted
or
soaked
or
buttered
a
natural
healthy
appetite
is
as
rare
a
thing
on
our
planet
almost
as
an
inhabitant
of
the
sun
or
moon
i
have
seen
more
than
one
mother
made
sick
by
using
while
nursing
improper
food
and
drink
i
have
known
milk
punch
taken
by
stealth
because
how
could
the
mother
it
was
said
ever
have
a
supply
of
food
for
her
poor
child
without
it
to
kindle
a
fever
that
came
very
near
burning
up
the
mother
and
child
both
and
yet
if
i
have
once
or
twice
succeeded
in
convincing
the
mother
that
she
was
only
suffering
the
natural
punishment
of
her
own
transgressions
i
have
never
so
far
as
i
now
recollect
succeeded
in
making
her
believe
that
her
iniquities
were
visited
upon
her
unoffending
infant
there
is
everywhere
the
most
painful
apathy
on
this
most
painful
subject
we
see
little
children
of
all
ages
everywhere
the
victims
of
debility
and
pain
and
suffering
and
disease
and
death
and
yet
we
very
seldom
seem
to
search
for
one
moment
for
the
causes
of
this
premature
destruction
in
fact
most
parents
even
many
intelligent
mothers
at
once
stare
if
you
attempt
to
inquire
into
the
causes
of
their
child
death
as
if
it
was
either
a
kind
of
sacrilege
or
an
impeachment
of
their
own
parental
affection
diseases
even
at
this
day
with
the
sun
of
science
blazing
in
meridian
splendor
they
seem
to
regard
as
the
judgments
of
heaven
and
to
think
of
tracing
out
the
causes
of
the
early
death
of
half
our
race
is
in
their
estimation
not
only
idle
but
wicked
yet
this
is
obviously
one
of
the
first
steps
every
where
which
philanthropy
demands
to
say
nothing
of
the
demands
of
christianity
it
is
the
first
step
for
the
physician
the
first
step
for
the
educator
the
first
step
for
the
parent
and
above
all
the
mother
nay
more
we
must
not
suppress
so
great
and
important
a
truth
it
is
the
first
step
for
the
legislator
and
the
minister
what
sense
is
there
in
continuing
century
after
century
and
age
after
age
to
expend
all
our
efforts
in
merely
the
diseased
half
of
mankind
when
those
same
efforts
are
amply
sufficient
if
early
and
properly
applied
not
only
to
continue
the
lives
of
the
whole
but
to
make
them
instead
of
passing
through
life
mere
of
humanity
but
i
must
not
forget
that
this
is
merely
a
small
manual
not
intended
for
those
who
make
it
their
profession
to
teach
the
laws
of
god
and
man
but
simply
for
young
mothers
for
the
sake
of
erring
humanity
would
that
i
could
but
for
one
moment
divest
myself
of
the
idea
that
in
writing
for
the
young
mother
i
am
not
writing
for
legislators
and
ministers
would
that
i
could
banish
from
my
mind
the
deep
conviction
that
the
mother
is
everywhere
far
more
the
to
her
infant
far
more
the
arbiter
of
the
present
and
eternal
destiny
of
her
child
than
he
who
is
more
commonly
regarded
as
such
every
mother
owes
it
not
only
to
herself
for
on
this
part
she
is
not
forgetful
but
to
her
offspring
to
abstain
during
the
period
of
nursing
at
least
from
all
causes
which
tend
to
produce
a
feverish
state
of
her
fluids
among
these
are
every
form
of
premature
exertion
whether
in
sitting
up
laboring
conversing
or
even
thinking
it
is
of
very
great
importance
that
both
the
body
and
the
mind
should
be
kept
quiet
and
the
more
so
the
better
among
the
particular
causes
of
fever
to
the
young
mother
dewees
enumerates
spirits
wine
and
other
fermented
liquors
a
room
too
much
heated
closed
curtains
confined
air
too
much
exposure
and
too
much
company
and
during
the
early
period
of
confinement
broths
and
animal
food
there
is
nothing
which
he
insists
on
more
strongly
than
the
importance
of
fresh
air
indeed
the
practice
of
confining
a
nursing
woman
in
a
space
scarcely
six
feet
square
and
excluding
the
air
surrounding
her
by
curtains
and
closed
windows
and
subjecting
her
to
the
necessity
of
breathing
twenty
times
the
air
that
has
already
been
as
often
discharged
filled
with
poison
from
her
lungs
is
not
too
strongly
reprobated
by
dewees
or
anybody
else
but
i
have
spoken
of
these
things
in
the
chapter
which
treats
on
the
nursery
i
would
only
observe
on
this
point
that
if
i
were
asked
what
one
thing
is
most
indispensable
to
the
health
of
the
nursing
woman
i
would
reply
fresh
air
and
if
asked
what
were
the
second
and
third
most
important
things
i
would
still
repeat
in
imitation
of
the
orator
of
old
in
regard
to
another
subject
fresh
air
fresh
air
this
important
ingredient
in
human
happiness
and
especially
in
the
happiness
of
the
young
mother
and
her
tender
infant
can
usually
be
had
within
doors
if
pains
enough
be
taken
but
if
the
weather
is
fine
and
in
every
respect
favorable
a
woman
who
is
in
tolerable
health
may
venture
abroad
a
little
in
about
three
weeks
after
her
confinement
and
sometimes
even
in
two
whether
her
exercise
be
without
or
within
doors
however
she
should
be
effectually
protected
against
chills
and
against
the
influence
of
currents
of
cold
air
it
has
been
incidentally
stated
that
dewees
objects
to
the
use
during
her
early
period
of
nursing
of
broths
and
animal
food
this
is
about
as
much
as
we
could
reasonably
expect
from
one
who
belongs
to
a
profession
whose
members
are
almost
without
exception
enslaved
to
the
practice
of
but
even
this
advice
of
his
if
duly
followed
would
be
a
great
advance
upon
the
practice
which
generally
prevails
there
is
so
universal
a
belief
among
females
that
they
demand
at
this
period
of
their
existence
not
only
a
larger
quantity
of
food
than
usual
but
also
that
which
is
more
stimulating
in
its
quality
as
almost
to
forbid
the
hopes
of
making
much
impression
upon
their
minds
many
young
mothers
seem
to
consider
themselves
as
licensed
during
a
part
of
their
lives
not
only
to
eat
immoderately
and
even
to
gluttony
but
also
to
swallow
almost
every
species
of
vile
trash
which
a
vile
world
affords
how
long
will
it
be
ere
the
mother
can
be
induced
to
take
as
much
pains
to
select
the
most
appropriate
and
most
healthy
aliment
for
herself
and
her
child
as
she
now
does
that
which
is
demanded
by
a
capricious
appetite
without
the
smallest
reference
to
fitness
or
digestibility
how
long
will
it
be
ere
the
mother
can
be
brought
to
believe
and
feel
that
in
every
step
she
takes
she
is
forming
the
habitation
of
an
immortal
spirit
a
spirit
too
whose
character
and
destiny
both
present
and
eternal
must
depend
in
no
small
degree
upon
the
character
of
the
dwelling
it
occupies
while
passing
through
this
stage
of
earthly
existence
how
long
will
it
be
before
mothers
can
be
made
to
believe
even
these
two
simple
truths
that
the
nourishment
which
the
human
being
actually
receives
is
not
always
in
exact
proportion
to
the
quantity
of
nutritious
food
which
he
throws
into
his
stomach
and
that
the
diet
is
always
best
for
both
mother
and
child
which
is
least
exciting
the
charleston
board
of
health
during
the
existence
of
cholera
in
that
city
in
publicly
announced
that
the
best
food
is
the
least
exciting
and
this
great
truth
is
just
as
true
in
all
other
places
and
circumstances
on
the
globe
as
it
was
then
in
south
carolina
and
though
i
am
far
from
believing
that
health
depends
more
on
food
and
drink
than
on
all
other
things
put
together
as
many
seem
to
suppose
yet
i
am
entirely
of
opinion
that
he
who
should
devote
himself
successfully
to
the
work
of
applying
this
truth
in
all
its
bearings
to
the
dietetic
practice
of
all
mankind
would
do
more
for
their
reformation
yes
and
their
salvation
too
than
has
yet
been
done
by
any
merely
being
since
the
first
day
of
the
creation
sec
how
many
lay
it
down
as
an
invariable
rule
that
no
system
can
be
pursued
with
a
child
till
it
is
six
months
old
and
it
must
be
admitted
by
all
that
for
several
months
after
birth
there
are
serious
difficulties
in
the
way
of
determining
with
any
degree
of
precision
how
often
a
child
should
be
nursed
or
fed
still
there
are
a
few
rules
of
universal
application
some
of
which
are
here
presented
a
child
should
never
be
nursed
merely
to
quiet
it
for
if
this
be
done
it
will
soon
learn
to
cry
whenever
it
feels
the
slightest
uneasiness
not
only
from
hunger
but
from
other
causes
merely
to
be
gratified
with
nursing
besides
if
its
cries
should
happen
to
be
from
illness
it
is
ten
to
one
but
the
reception
of
anything
into
the
stomach
will
do
harm
instead
of
good
the
stomach
like
every
other
organ
in
the
body
which
is
muscular
must
have
time
for
rest
and
this
in
the
case
of
children
as
well
as
adults
but
to
nurse
them
too
frequently
is
in
opposition
to
this
rule
and
therefore
of
evil
tendency
for
reasons
which
may
be
seen
by
the
last
rule
there
should
be
regular
seasons
for
nursing
and
these
should
be
adhered
to
especially
by
night
when
very
young
once
in
three
hours
may
not
be
too
frequent
i
believe
that
it
is
seldom
proper
to
nurse
a
child
more
frequently
than
this
but
whenever
three
hours
becomes
a
suitable
period
by
day
once
in
four
hours
will
be
often
enough
by
night
i
will
not
undertake
to
say
at
what
precise
age
children
should
be
nursed
at
intervals
of
three
and
four
hours
each
because
some
children
are
older
at
three
months
than
others
are
at
four
there
is
one
grand
mistake
however
against
which
i
must
caution
young
mothers
which
is
not
to
indulge
the
vain
expectation
that
feeble
infants
will
become
robust
in
proportion
to
their
indulgence
on
the
contrary
it
is
the
more
necessary
to
be
strict
with
feeble
children
they
are
feeble
to
keep
them
hanging
at
the
breast
to
invigorate
them
is
the
very
way
to
counteract
our
own
intentions
and
defeat
our
own
purpose
seasons
of
entire
rest
are
even
more
important
to
their
stomachs
than
to
those
of
other
persons
but
in
order
to
secure
intervals
of
rest
both
to
the
strong
and
the
feeble
we
must
avoid
the
pernicious
habit
of
giving
infants
pap
and
other
delicacies
between
meals
many
a
child
health
is
ruined
by
this
practice
nothing
should
be
put
into
their
stomachs
for
many
months
if
they
are
in
health
but
the
mother
milk
this
says
dunglison
is
the
sole
food
of
the
infant
and
is
consequently
sufficiently
nutrient
to
maintain
life
and
to
minister
to
the
growth
during
the
earliest
periods
of
existence
footnote
elements
of
hygiene
page
in
another
place
he
says
milk
is
an
appropriate
nourishment
at
all
ages
and
is
more
so
the
nearer
to
birth
sec
of
we
all
know
says
dewees
how
easily
the
stomach
may
be
made
to
demand
more
food
than
is
absolutely
required
first
by
the
repetition
of
aliment
and
secondly
by
its
variety
therefore
both
of
these
causes
must
be
avoided
the
stomach
like
every
other
part
can
and
unfortunately
does
acquire
habits
highly
injurious
to
itself
and
that
of
demanding
an
unnecessary
quantity
of
aliment
is
not
one
of
the
least
it
should
therefore
be
constantly
borne
in
mind
that
it
is
not
the
quantity
of
food
taken
into
the
stomach
that
is
available
to
the
proper
purposes
of
the
system
but
the
quantity
which
can
be
digested
and
converted
into
nourishment
fit
to
be
applied
to
such
purposes
there
is
a
great
deal
of
truth
in
these
remarks
and
especially
in
the
closing
one
that
not
all
which
is
taken
into
the
stomach
is
digested
it
is
highly
probable
that
the
least
quantity
which
is
usually
given
to
an
infant
is
more
than
sufficient
for
the
purposes
of
digestion
and
that
nearly
every
child
in
the
arms
of
its
mother
is
i
know
it
has
been
said
by
some
physicians
and
by
those
who
are
sensible
men
in
other
respects
too
that
the
child
stomach
is
a
pretty
correct
guide
in
regard
to
quantity
if
we
give
it
too
much
say
they
it
will
reject
it
as
if
that
were
an
end
of
the
matter
but
it
is
not
so
it
is
by
no
means
harmless
to
fill
the
child
stomach
as
full
as
is
possible
without
overflowing
such
a
process
though
it
should
not
create
disease
directly
would
produce
a
gluttonous
habit
the
stomach
being
muscular
may
be
increased
in
size
by
use
like
all
other
muscular
organs
the
hands
the
arms
the
legs
the
feet
the
fleshy
portions
of
the
face
even
may
be
disproportionally
enlarged
by
constant
use
thus
a
sailor
who
uses
his
hands
and
arms
much
more
than
his
legs
and
feet
has
the
former
unusually
large
one
who
is
much
accustomed
to
walking
has
large
feet
and
in
a
tailor
who
from
childhood
uses
his
lower
limbs
comparatively
little
they
are
both
small
and
slender
on
the
same
principle
the
stomach
by
inordinate
use
and
by
carrying
unreasonable
loads
may
be
made
nearly
twice
as
large
as
nature
intended
and
may
demand
twice
as
much
food
and
i
have
no
doubt
that
the
bulk
of
mankind
young
and
old
eat
about
twice
as
much
as
nature
unperverted
would
require
if
the
suggestions
of
our
last
section
are
duly
attended
to
one
of
the
causes
which
lead
the
stomach
to
demand
an
unreasonable
quantity
of
food
will
be
avoided
i
mean
the
too
frequent
repetition
of
aliment
and
if
we
never
depart
from
the
general
rule
already
laid
down
not
to
give
the
infant
anything
but
its
mother
milk
we
shall
escape
the
evils
incident
to
variety
sec
long
should
milk
be
the
only
on
this
point
there
is
a
great
diversity
of
opinion
perhaps
the
most
approved
role
of
universal
application
is
that
the
first
change
should
be
made
in
the
child
diet
when
the
teeth
begin
to
appear
this
period
it
is
well
known
can
not
be
fixed
to
any
particular
age
but
varies
from
the
fifth
to
the
twelfth
month
some
mothers
who
have
borne
with
me
patiently
to
this
place
will
probably
here
object
what
child
they
will
ask
would
ever
have
any
strength
brought
up
so
not
only
a
little
pap
and
gruel
is
in
their
estimation
necessary
long
before
this
period
but
even
many
choice
bits
of
meat
now
i
am
very
sure
that
these
choice
bits
whatever
they
may
be
given
to
a
child
before
it
has
teeth
not
only
do
no
good
but
actually
do
mischief
indeed
that
which
does
no
good
in
the
stomach
must
do
harm
of
course
since
it
is
not
only
in
the
way
but
acts
like
a
foreign
body
there
producing
more
or
less
of
irritation
i
ought
to
state
in
this
place
that
many
people
mothers
among
the
rest
have
very
inadequate
ideas
of
digestion
they
appear
to
have
no
farther
notion
of
the
digestive
process
than
that
it
consists
in
reducing
to
a
pulp
the
substances
which
are
swallowed
and
hence
whatever
is
reduced
to
a
pulp
they
regard
as
being
digested
whereas
nothing
is
better
known
to
the
anatomist
and
physiologist
than
that
this
the
formation
of
in
the
stomach
constitutes
only
a
very
small
part
of
the
digestive
process
the
chyme
must
pass
into
the
duodenum
and
other
portions
of
intestine
beyond
the
stomach
and
be
retained
there
for
some
time
before
it
will
form
perfect
chyle
this
is
a
more
important
part
of
the
work
of
digestion
than
even
the
former
for
suppose
the
chyme
to
be
perfect
though
even
this
may
be
mere
pulp
rather
than
chyme
and
suppose
it
pass
quietly
along
into
the
duodenum
and
other
small
intestines
all
this
process
thus
far
may
go
on
naturally
enough
and
yet
the
chyle
may
not
be
well
formed
and
the
chymous
mass
may
find
its
way
out
of
the
system
without
answering
any
of
the
purposes
of
nutrition
for
no
matter
how
well
the
food
is
dissolved
in
the
stomach
if
it
do
not
become
good
and
proper
chyle
the
blood
which
is
formed
will
not
be
good
and
perfect
blood
or
lastly
if
it
to
make
good
blood
it
may
still
be
faulty
so
that
the
particles
which
should
be
applied
to
build
up
or
repair
the
system
are
either
not
used
or
if
used
answer
the
purpose
but
imperfectly
we
hence
see
how
little
prepared
a
large
proportion
of
the
community
are
to
judge
of
the
digestibility
or
fitness
of
a
substance
for
infants
by
their
own
observation
and
experience
merely
and
how
much
more
wisely
they
act
in
contenting
themselves
with
giving
them
at
least
until
they
have
teeth
such
food
only
as
the
author
of
nature
seems
to
have
assigned
them
especially
when
thus
course
is
precisely
that
which
is
recommended
or
sanctioned
by
nearly
every
judicious
physician
as
well
as
by
almost
all
our
writers
on
health
sec
feeding
before
having
laid
down
the
general
rule
that
until
the
appearance
of
teeth
the
sole
food
of
an
infant
should
be
the
milk
of
its
own
mother
i
proceed
to
speak
of
some
of
the
more
common
exceptions
to
it
exception
the
first
of
these
is
when
the
supply
furnished
by
the
mother
is
scanty
there
may
be
two
causes
of
the
scantiness
of
this
supply
the
want
of
suitable
nourishment
by
the
mother
and
a
feeble
constitution
or
bad
health
in
the
former
case
it
should
be
her
first
object
as
it
undoubtedly
will
be
that
of
her
physician
to
improve
the
quality
of
her
diet
and
in
the
latter
to
restore
her
health
or
at
least
invigorate
her
constitution
in
regard
to
the
proper
diet
of
a
as
such
as
well
as
the
general
management
which
her
case
requires
a
volume
might
be
written
without
exhausting
the
subject
but
i
have
already
said
as
much
on
this
subject
in
another
place
as
my
limits
will
permit
but
we
can
not
wait
for
the
mother
health
to
improve
and
allow
the
infant
to
suffer
in
the
mean
time
for
a
due
supply
of
food
the
appropriate
question
now
is
how
shall
such
a
supply
be
furnished
this
should
be
done
by
means
of
an
article
resembling
in
its
properties
as
closely
as
possible
the
mother
milk
for
this
purpose
we
have
only
to
mix
with
a
suitable
quantity
of
new
cow
milk
one
third
of
water
and
sweeten
it
a
little
with
loaf
sugar
this
is
to
be
given
to
the
child
at
suitable
intervals
and
in
proper
quantities
by
means
of
a
common
sucking
bottle
it
is
indeed
sometimes
given
with
the
spoon
but
the
bottle
is
better
to
the
question
whether
the
child
should
be
confined
to
this
till
the
period
of
weaning
dewees
answers
no
i
am
surprised
at
this
and
my
surprise
is
increased
when
i
find
him
almost
in
the
very
next
breath
urging
with
all
his
might
numerous
reasons
against
the
very
common
notion
that
children
in
early
life
require
a
variety
of
food
he
even
insists
on
the
importance
of
confining
the
child
to
a
single
article
of
food
when
it
is
practicable
yet
he
has
not
given
us
so
much
as
one
reason
why
it
is
not
practicable
in
the
case
before
us
but
has
gone
on
to
speak
of
barley
water
gum
arabic
water
rice
water
arrowroot
i
venture
therefore
to
dissent
from
him
and
to
answer
the
foregoing
question
in
the
affirmative
when
one
good
and
substantial
reason
can
be
given
for
the
decision
will
however
be
reconsidered
i
have
already
stated
the
general
rule
for
preparing
this
substitute
for
the
mother
milk
but
there
are
several
minor
directions
which
may
be
useful
to
those
who
are
wholly
without
experience
on
the
subject
if
possible
the
milk
used
should
not
only
be
just
taken
from
the
cow
but
should
always
be
from
the
cow
for
it
is
well
known
that
the
quality
of
milk
often
differs
very
materially
even
among
cows
feeding
in
the
same
pasture
or
from
the
same
pile
of
hay
and
the
stomach
becomes
most
easily
reconciled
to
the
mixture
when
it
is
uniform
in
its
qualities
great
care
should
also
be
taken
to
see
that
the
cow
whose
milk
is
used
is
young
and
healthy
the
mixture
should
not
be
prepared
any
faster
than
it
is
wanted
and
should
always
be
prepared
in
vessels
perfectly
clean
and
sweet
and
given
as
soon
as
possible
after
it
is
prepared
to
prevent
any
degree
of
fermentation
it
is
never
so
well
to
heat
it
by
the
fire
if
taken
from
the
cow
just
before
it
is
used
and
if
the
water
to
be
added
is
warm
enough
the
temperature
will
hardly
need
to
be
raised
any
higher
when
it
is
impracticable
in
all
cases
to
take
milk
for
this
purpose
immediately
from
the
cow
it
should
be
kept
in
winter
where
it
will
not
freeze
and
in
summer
where
there
will
be
no
tendency
to
acidity
some
mothers
and
nurses
are
addicted
to
the
practice
of
passing
the
food
through
their
own
mouths
before
they
give
it
to
the
child
with
a
view
no
doubt
to
see
that
it
is
at
a
proper
temperature
this
practice
is
not
only
wholly
unnecessary
but
altogether
disgusting
and
even
ridiculous
a
thermometer
would
answer
every
purpose
and
save
even
the
trouble
of
another
disgusting
practice
that
of
blowing
it
with
the
breath
the
most
proper
season
for
giving
the
child
this
preparation
is
immediately
after
it
has
been
nursing
it
is
better
for
both
mother
and
child
that
the
latter
should
nurse
just
as
often
as
though
the
supply
of
food
was
adequate
to
his
wants
and
when
his
first
supply
is
exhausted
then
let
him
make
up
his
meal
from
the
sucking
bottle
the
great
advantage
of
this
plan
is
that
he
will
not
be
so
likely
in
this
way
to
be
if
he
is
really
needy
he
will
accept
the
bottle
even
if
he
do
not
like
it
quite
so
well
if
he
refuse
it
let
him
go
without
till
he
is
hungry
enough
to
receive
it
in
regard
to
the
water
used
in
the
preparation
only
one
thing
needs
to
be
said
which
is
that
it
should
be
pure
if
it
is
not
it
should
by
all
means
be
boiled
the
sugar
used
should
be
of
the
very
best
kind
and
the
quantity
not
large
since
if
the
preparation
be
too
sweet
it
readily
becomes
acid
in
the
stomach
there
has
been
and
still
is
a
controversy
going
on
among
medical
men
whether
sugar
is
or
is
not
hurtful
to
the
young
who
shall
decide
when
doctors
disagree
has
often
been
asked
without
undertaking
the
task
myself
i
may
perhaps
be
permitted
to
say
that
i
can
not
see
any
reason
why
a
substance
so
pure
and
so
highly
nutritious
as
sugar
if
given
in
very
small
quantity
only
should
prove
injurious
though
i
do
not
regard
the
reasoning
of
dewees
as
very
conclusive
on
the
subject
when
in
reply
to
cadogan
he
has
the
following
language
if
sugar
be
improper
why
does
it
so
largely
enter
into
the
composition
of
the
early
food
of
all
animals
it
is
in
vain
that
physicians
declaim
against
this
article
since
it
forms
between
seven
and
eight
per
cent
of
the
milk
now
with
me
the
fact
that
milk
and
almost
all
other
kinds
of
food
are
furnished
with
a
measure
of
this
substance
is
the
strongest
reason
i
am
acquainted
with
for
making
no
additions
i
believe
however
that
they
may
sometimes
be
made
but
not
for
these
reasons
exception
the
second
striking
exception
to
the
general
rule
that
has
been
laid
down
is
when
the
mother
is
unable
to
nurse
her
own
child
from
positive
ill
health
or
when
circumstances
exist
which
render
it
obviously
improper
that
she
should
do
it
the
following
are
some
of
the
circumstances
which
render
such
a
departure
from
nature
indispensable
when
the
mother
is
affected
strongly
with
a
hereditary
disease
such
as
consumption
or
scrofula
or
when
her
constitution
is
tainted
as
it
were
with
venereal
disease
or
other
permanent
affections
when
nursing
produces
uniformly
some
very
troublesome
or
dangerous
disease
in
the
mother
as
cough
colic
there
are
a
few
instances
in
which
the
milk
of
the
mother
owing
to
an
unknown
cause
has
been
found
by
experience
to
disagree
with
the
child
in
these
circumstances
it
is
the
unquestionable
duty
of
the
mother
to
resort
wholly
to
feeding
sometimes
the
milk
at
first
abundant
fails
suddenly
owing
to
some
accidental
or
constitutional
defect
and
this
failure
becomes
habitual
in
all
these
circumstances
the
proper
resort
is
to
a
sucking
bottle
or
a
hired
nurse
i
generally
prefer
the
latter
the
cases
which
seem
to
me
to
admit
of
the
former
will
be
pointed
out
in
the
next
section
when
the
bottle
is
used
says
dewees
much
care
is
requisite
to
preserve
it
sweet
and
free
from
all
impurities
or
the
remains
of
the
former
food
by
which
the
present
may
be
rendered
impure
or
sour
for
which
purpose
a
great
deal
of
caution
must
be
observed
the
business
of
feeding
a
child
whether
by
the
bottle
or
the
spoon
should
never
be
hurried
the
slower
it
is
the
better
we
should
stop
from
time
to
time
during
the
process
nor
should
the
nourishment
be
given
while
lying
down
it
is
much
more
pleasant
as
well
as
more
safe
to
sit
up
a
few
thoughts
more
on
the
character
and
condition
of
the
milk
which
we
give
to
the
young
will
conclude
the
second
division
of
this
section
some
are
fond
of
boiling
milk
for
infants
but
to
this
i
am
decidedly
opposed
so
long
as
they
are
in
health
boiling
takes
away
or
appears
to
take
away
some
of
the
best
properties
of
the
milk
it
is
true
that
milk
which
is
boiled
does
not
turn
sour
so
readily
in
hot
weather
but
it
is
quite
unnecessary
to
boil
milk
in
the
common
manner
in
order
to
present
its
changing
since
such
a
result
can
be
prevented
by
another
process
you
have
only
to
put
your
milk
in
a
kettle
cover
it
closely
and
heat
it
quickly
to
the
boiling
point
and
then
remove
and
cool
it
as
speedily
as
possible
this
plan
prevents
the
rising
to
the
surface
of
that
coat
or
pellicle
which
contains
some
of
the
most
valuable
properties
of
the
milk
i
have
already
said
that
it
was
as
necessary
that
the
stomach
should
have
rest
as
any
other
muscular
organ
some
writers
say
that
the
infant
should
be
kept
perfectly
quiet
at
least
half
an
hour
after
each
meal
this
is
certainly
necessary
with
feeble
children
but
i
question
its
necessity
in
the
case
of
those
who
are
strong
and
robust
i
would
not
recommend
however
nor
even
tolerate
for
one
moment
the
absurd
practice
of
so
common
with
a
few
ignorant
nurses
and
mothers
as
if
they
could
jolt
down
the
food
in
the
stomach
with
just
as
much
safety
as
they
can
shake
down
the
contents
of
a
farmer
bag
of
produce
such
mothers
as
these
should
go
and
reside
among
the
native
tribes
of
indians
in
guiana
in
south
america
where
they
make
it
a
point
not
only
to
stuff
their
children
stomachs
as
long
as
they
will
hold
but
actually
to
shake
it
down
little
less
absurd
than
jolting
is
the
custom
of
tossing
a
child
high
in
quick
succession
which
is
practised
not
only
after
meals
but
at
other
times
but
on
this
point
i
have
treated
elsewhere
some
give
the
sucking
bottle
to
children
as
a
plaything
this
is
just
about
as
wise
a
practice
as
that
of
giving
them
books
as
playthings
both
are
done
usually
to
save
the
time
and
trouble
of
those
whose
office
it
is
to
devote
their
time
to
the
very
purpose
of
managing
and
educating
their
offspring
the
evil
however
of
suffering
the
child
to
have
the
bottle
when
it
pleases
is
that
he
will
thus
be
tasting
food
so
often
as
to
interfere
with
and
disturb
the
process
of
digestion
to
his
great
and
lasting
injury
for
in
this
way
a
part
of
the
food
will
pass
from
the
stomach
into
the
bowels
unchanged
or
at
least
but
imperfectly
digested
where
it
is
liable
to
become
sour
and
cause
disease
it
is
not
to
be
doubted
that
many
diarrhoeas
as
well
as
other
bowel
affections
are
produced
in
this
way
children
that
are
always
eating
are
seldom
healthy
and
we
may
hence
see
the
reason
in
speaking
of
the
importance
of
keeping
the
bottle
from
which
a
child
takes
his
food
perfectly
clean
and
sweet
i
ought
to
have
extended
the
injunction
much
farther
there
is
a
degree
of
slovenliness
sometimes
observable
in
those
who
manage
children
both
when
they
are
sick
and
when
they
are
in
health
which
even
common
sense
can
not
and
ought
not
to
tolerate
every
vessel
which
is
used
in
preparing
or
administering
anything
for
children
ought
after
we
have
used
it
to
be
immediately
and
effectually
cleansed
how
shocking
is
it
to
see
dirty
vessels
standing
in
the
nursery
from
hour
to
hour
becoming
sour
or
impure
how
much
more
so
still
to
see
food
in
copper
vessels
or
in
the
red
earthen
ones
glazed
with
a
poisonous
oxyd
i
speak
now
more
particularly
of
vessels
in
which
food
is
given
for
with
the
administration
of
medicine
and
nursing
the
sick
i
do
not
intend
in
this
volume
to
interfere
exception
we
come
now
to
the
consideration
of
those
cases
for
such
it
will
not
be
doubted
there
are
where
a
hired
nurse
is
to
be
preferred
to
feeding
by
the
hand
before
proceeding
farther
however
it
is
important
to
say
that
if
a
nurse
could
always
be
procured
whose
health
and
temper
and
habits
were
good
who
had
no
infant
of
her
own
and
who
would
do
as
well
for
the
infant
in
every
respect
as
his
own
mother
it
would
be
preferable
to
have
no
feeding
by
the
hand
at
all
but
such
nurses
are
very
scarce
their
temper
or
habits
or
general
health
will
often
be
such
as
no
genuine
parent
would
desire
and
such
as
they
ought
to
be
sorry
to
see
engrafted
in
any
degree
on
the
child
for
even
admitting
what
is
claimed
by
some
that
the
temper
of
the
nurse
does
affect
the
properties
of
the
milk
and
thus
injure
the
child
both
physically
and
morally
still
much
injury
may
and
inevitably
will
result
from
the
influence
of
her
constant
presence
and
example
others
have
infants
of
their
own
in
which
case
either
their
own
child
or
the
adopted
one
will
suffer
and
in
a
majority
of
cases
it
can
scarcely
be
doubted
it
will
be
and
i
doubt
the
morality
of
requiring
a
nurse
in
these
cases
to
give
up
her
own
child
wholly
if
must
be
fed
why
not
our
own
as
well
as
that
of
another
the
only
cases
then
which
seem
to
me
to
justify
the
employment
of
a
nurse
are
where
she
possesses
at
least
the
qualifications
above
mentioned
and
as
these
are
rare
not
many
nurses
of
course
would
on
this
principle
be
employed
but
when
employed
it
is
highly
desirable
that
the
following
rules
should
be
observed
the
nurse
should
suckle
the
child
at
both
breasts
otherwise
he
is
liable
to
acquire
a
degree
of
crookedness
in
his
form
there
is
another
evil
which
sometimes
results
from
the
too
common
neglect
of
this
rule
which
is
that
it
endangers
the
deterioration
of
the
quality
of
the
milk
the
milk
which
is
thus
substituted
for
that
of
the
mother
should
be
as
nearly
as
possible
of
the
same
age
as
the
child
who
is
to
receive
it
it
should
be
remembered
however
that
the
milk
is
not
so
good
after
the
twelfth
or
thirteenth
month
nor
so
good
under
the
third
when
the
parent
or
some
trusty
and
confidential
friend
can
without
the
aid
of
interested
spies
and
emissaries
have
an
eye
to
the
general
treatment
and
especially
to
the
moral
management
it
should
be
done
for
even
the
best
nurses
may
so
differ
in
their
principles
manners
and
habits
from
the
parent
that
the
latter
would
deem
it
preferable
to
withdraw
the
child
and
resort
at
once
to
feeding
sec
teething
to
this
period
will
of
course
be
longer
or
shorter
according
as
the
teeth
begin
to
appear
earlier
or
later
and
according
to
the
time
when
it
is
thought
proper
to
wean
on
few
points
perhaps
has
there
existed
a
greater
diversity
of
opinion
than
in
regard
to
the
age
most
proper
for
weaning
the
limits
of
this
work
do
not
permit
a
thorough
discussion
of
the
question
and
i
shall
therefore
be
very
brief
in
my
remarks
on
the
subject
cullen
whose
opinion
on
topics
of
this
kind
is
certainly
entitled
to
much
respect
thought
that
less
than
seven
or
more
than
eleven
months
of
nursing
was
injurious
yet
in
some
countries
and
even
in
some
parts
of
our
own
the
period
is
extended
by
the
mother
from
choice
to
two
years
and
although
the
milk
is
not
so
good
after
the
thirteenth
or
fourteenth
month
i
have
never
either
known
or
heard
that
any
evil
consequences
followed
from
the
practice
loudon
a
recent
writer
observes
that
the
period
of
nursing
has
a
great
influence
over
the
numbers
of
mankind
in
various
countries
as
is
evinced
by
numerous
facts
he
adduces
proofs
of
this
position
thus
he
says
in
china
where
the
population
is
excessive
and
the
inhuman
practice
of
infanticide
is
common
they
wean
a
child
as
soon
as
it
can
put
its
hand
to
its
mouth
on
the
other
hand
the
indians
of
north
america
do
not
wean
their
children
until
they
are
old
and
strong
enough
to
run
about
generally
they
are
suckled
for
a
period
of
more
than
two
years
he
then
enters
into
a
physiological
inquiry
why
it
is
that
british
mothers
do
not
usually
suckle
their
children
longer
than
ten
months
he
seems
though
he
does
not
give
us
his
precise
opinion
to
think
that
in
all
ordinary
cases
the
period
of
nursing
ought
to
be
protracted
to
two
or
three
years
and
that
perhaps
it
would
be
better
still
to
extend
it
to
four
or
five
his
remarks
are
so
excellent
and
withal
so
curious
and
their
tendency
so
humane
that
we
venture
to
insert
one
or
two
of
his
paragraphs
entire
certain
it
is
that
the
milk
does
not
diminish
particularly
at
that
time
ten
months
so
far
as
regards
quantity
and
from
the
health
of
children
reared
without
beyond
this
time
it
as
certainly
undergoes
no
change
in
its
quality
children
are
sometimes
so
old
before
weaning
as
to
be
able
to
ask
for
the
breast
and
it
has
not
been
remarked
that
the
health
of
mothers
thus
suckling
was
in
any
way
worse
than
that
of
their
neighbors
altogether
then
it
may
be
asserted
that
a
mother
is
likely
to
enjoy
better
health
and
to
be
less
liable
to
sickness
and
death
during
lactation
than
during
pregnancy
many
women
believe
or
affect
to
believe
that
the
weakness
they
labor
under
arises
from
some
latent
moral
or
physical
cause
but
this
weakness
is
not
attributed
to
lactation
in
the
earlier
months
of
suckling
because
the
mother
then
considers
herself
fulfilling
a
necessary
duty
which
her
constitution
for
so
long
is
well
able
to
bear
so
soon
however
as
the
period
of
lactation
has
passed
over
as
it
is
established
by
custom
or
fashion
she
imagines
she
is
exceeding
the
intentions
of
nature
and
she
forthwith
concludes
that
the
continuance
of
suckling
is
the
cause
of
her
uncomfortable
sensations
this
whim
being
entertained
the
child
is
weaned
and
too
often
becomes
the
victim
of
a
most
reprehensible
delusion
since
nature
has
furnished
the
mother
with
milk
for
a
longer
period
than
custom
demands
it
is
evident
that
some
good
purpose
for
the
mother
and
child
was
intended
in
this
arrangement
had
it
been
otherwise
the
secretion
of
milk
would
stop
at
a
definite
time
in
like
manner
as
the
period
of
gestation
is
definite
that
a
child
in
comparison
with
the
young
of
the
lower
animals
is
so
long
unable
to
provide
for
itself
strongly
tends
to
corroborate
the
proofs
already
advanced
that
nature
originally
had
in
view
a
more
protracted
period
for
lactation
than
is
now
allowed
some
writers
following
the
laws
of
nature
as
they
interpreted
them
fixed
the
period
of
weaning
at
fifteen
months
when
the
infant
has
got
its
eight
incisors
and
four
canine
teeth
there
are
instances
of
mothers
having
suckled
their
children
for
three
four
five
and
even
seven
consecutive
years
we
ourselves
have
known
cases
of
lactation
being
prolonged
far
three
and
for
four
years
with
the
happiest
results
it
appears
to
me
better
therefore
that
the
child
should
be
nursed
in
all
ordinary
cases
from
twelve
to
fifteen
months
and
when
there
are
no
special
objections
about
two
years
as
the
change
whenever
it
is
made
and
however
gradual
it
may
be
is
an
important
one
in
its
effects
on
the
stomach
and
bowels
it
is
better
to
wean
a
little
earlier
or
a
little
later
than
to
do
so
just
at
the
close
of
summer
or
beginning
of
autumn
at
which
season
bowel
complaints
are
most
common
most
severe
and
most
dangerous
it
is
sufficiently
unfortunate
that
teething
should
commence
just
at
this
period
but
when
we
add
another
cause
of
irregular
action
which
we
can
control
to
one
which
we
we
act
very
unwisely
i
have
already
observed
that
we
may
begin
to
feed
children
when
the
teeth
begin
to
appear
by
this
is
not
meant
that
we
should
do
so
while
the
system
is
under
the
irritation
to
which
teething
usually
or
at
least
often
subjects
it
but
when
this
is
over
and
a
few
teeth
have
appeared
it
is
usually
a
proper
time
to
commence
our
operations
the
first
food
given
should
be
precisely
of
the
kind
which
has
been
recommended
for
those
children
who
are
fed
by
the
hand
the
rules
and
restrictions
by
which
we
are
to
be
guided
are
the
same
except
in
one
point
which
is
that
in
the
case
we
are
now
considering
the
child
should
be
fed
let
not
parents
be
anxious
about
their
healthy
children
under
two
years
who
have
a
supply
of
good
milk
either
from
the
mother
or
from
the
cow
for
those
that
are
feeble
a
physician
may
and
ought
to
prescribe
not
medicine
but
appropriate
food
drink
when
the
grinding
teeth
have
cut
through
if
we
have
any
doubts
in
regard
to
the
nutritive
qualities
of
the
food
we
are
giving
we
may
improve
it
by
adding
instead
of
the
one
third
of
pure
water
a
similar
quantity
of
gum
arabic
water
barley
water
or
rice
water
some
use
a
little
weak
animal
broth
but
this
is
unnecessary
and
i
think
on
the
whole
injurious
except
for
purposes
strictly
medicinal
this
course
is
so
simple
and
so
far
removed
from
that
which
is
generally
adopted
that
few
mothers
will
probably
be
willing
to
pursue
it
with
perseverance
especially
when
the
teeth
appear
very
late
those
who
are
however
will
be
richly
rewarded
in
the
end
in
the
advantages
which
will
accrue
to
the
child
health
and
the
vigor
it
will
ensure
to
his
constitution
sec
the
process
of
it
has
already
been
shown
that
in
weaning
some
regard
should
be
had
to
the
season
of
the
year
and
that
the
end
of
summer
and
beginning
of
fall
are
of
all
periods
the
most
unfavorable
the
best
time
on
every
account
is
in
the
spring
in
march
april
may
or
june
and
the
next
best
is
during
the
months
of
october
and
november
but
december
january
and
february
are
better
than
july
august
and
september
weaning
should
never
be
sudden
we
may
safely
and
properly
call
upon
those
who
are
addicted
to
snuff
or
opium
taking
tobacco
chewing
rum
drinking
and
other
habits
which
are
purely
artificial
to
break
off
wean
suddenly
since
can
do
so
with
considerable
safety
and
will
seldom
have
the
courage
or
the
perseverance
to
do
it
otherwise
but
with
the
child
in
regard
to
his
food
such
a
course
will
not
be
advisable
if
we
regard
his
future
health
or
happiness
he
must
be
weaned
gradually
the
first
proper
step
will
be
to
give
the
child
a
little
larger
quantity
of
the
cow
milk
and
gum
arabic
mixture
between
nursings
at
the
same
time
increasing
very
gradually
the
intervals
of
nursing
when
the
intervals
become
six
hours
distant
from
each
other
it
will
be
best
to
add
a
little
good
bread
to
the
milk
with
which
it
is
fed
about
two
or
three
times
a
day
arrowroot
jelly
if
he
can
be
made
to
relish
it
will
be
highly
useful
but
if
not
some
boiled
rice
into
which
a
little
arrowroot
has
been
sprinkled
while
boiling
may
be
added
to
his
milk
it
may
be
worth
the
attempt
to
excite
an
aversion
in
the
child
to
nursing
his
mother
so
that
be
will
refuse
to
nurse
if
possible
of
his
own
accord
this
aversion
may
be
excited
by
such
an
application
of
aloes
or
some
other
offensive
substance
as
will
cause
him
to
withdraw
himself
from
the
breast
as
soon
as
he
tastes
it
a
serious
mistake
is
often
made
in
connection
with
weaning
in
giving
the
child
not
only
too
much
food
but
that
which
is
too
solid
or
too
rich
this
mistake
has
undoubtedly
grown
out
of
the
belief
that
his
feeble
condition
it
whereas
the
truth
is
that
he
neither
needs
food
at
this
period
nor
is
capable
of
digesting
it
for
let
us
be
as
judicious
in
the
process
of
weaning
as
we
may
the
tone
of
the
child
stomach
will
be
somewhat
reduced
or
in
other
words
its
powers
of
digestion
will
be
weakened
by
it
and
to
give
it
strong
food
or
overload
it
with
that
which
is
weaker
is
not
only
unreasonable
and
unphilosophical
but
cruel
and
if
there
should
be
a
tendency
in
the
child
constitution
to
rickets
scrofula
consumption
and
other
wasting
diseases
such
a
course
would
be
likely
to
bring
them
on
and
destroy
life
when
milk
will
agree
says
dewees
there
is
no
food
so
proper
it
may
be
employed
in
any
of
its
combinations
with
good
wheaten
bread
rice
sago
only
remembering
that
when
either
of
these
articles
is
found
to
agree
it
should
be
continued
perseveringly
until
it
may
become
offensive
in
this
case
some
new
combination
may
be
required
i
do
not
see
the
necessity
of
continuing
one
kind
of
food
till
it
besides
i
do
not
believe
that
these
simple
articles
of
food
are
apt
to
become
offensive
to
stomachs
that
have
not
already
been
spoiled
but
whether
a
single
dish
should
or
should
not
come
to
be
offensive
i
greatly
prefer
an
occasional
change
buchan
in
his
advice
to
mothers
has
recommended
it
to
them
to
boil
bread
for
their
infants
in
water
it
should
not
for
this
purpose
nor
indeed
for
any
other
be
new
it
is
best
at
one
or
two
days
old
it
may
be
boiled
in
a
small
quantity
of
water
or
what
is
still
better
of
milk
or
it
may
be
steamed
till
it
becomes
soft
and
light
almost
like
new
bread
but
without
any
of
the
objectionable
properties
of
that
which
is
wholly
new
to
bread
thus
prepared
is
to
be
added
a
suitable
quantity
of
milk
fresh
from
the
cow
and
a
little
diluted
with
water
but
not
boiled
but
as
there
may
be
here
and
there
at
any
age
a
stomach
with
which
milk
with
bread
or
rice
or
sago
will
not
agree
though
i
think
they
must
be
very
rare
cases
we
may
be
allowed
to
substitute
for
it
a
solution
of
gum
arabic
in
the
proportion
of
an
ounce
to
a
pint
of
water
to
which
may
be
added
a
little
sugar
and
if
the
child
is
old
enough
to
observe
the
color
just
milk
enough
to
change
the
appearance
another
preparation
for
the
same
purpose
consists
of
rennet
whey
a
little
sweetened
and
disguised
if
necessary
as
just
stated
the
health
of
the
mother
too
during
the
period
of
weaning
often
needs
great
attention
let
her
avoid
medicine
however
if
possible
a
due
regard
to
food
drink
exercise
and
rest
of
body
and
mind
will
usually
be
found
more
effective
as
well
as
more
permanently
efficacious
sec
subsequently
to
you
will
allow
me
to
introduce
in
this
place
some
of
the
sentiments
of
cadogan
an
english
physician
from
a
little
work
on
the
management
of
children
footnote
though
remarks
will
apply
more
closely
to
england
in
they
are
by
no
means
inapplicable
to
the
united
states
in
i
do
it
with
the
more
pleasure
because
though
he
wrote
almost
a
century
ago
he
urges
the
same
general
principles
on
which
i
have
all
along
been
insisting
hence
it
will
be
seen
that
mine
are
no
notions
his
remarks
refer
to
the
young
of
every
age
but
chiefly
to
early
infancy
and
childhood
it
will
be
found
necessary
in
some
instances
to
abridge
but
i
shall
endeavor
not
to
misrepresent
the
doctor
views
look
over
the
bills
of
mortality
almost
half
of
those
who
fill
up
that
black
list
die
under
five
years
of
age
so
that
half
the
people
that
come
into
the
world
go
out
of
it
again
before
they
become
of
the
least
use
to
it
or
to
themselves
to
me
this
seems
to
deserve
serious
consideration
it
is
ridiculous
to
charge
it
upon
nature
and
to
suppose
that
infants
are
more
subject
to
disease
and
death
than
grown
persons
on
the
contrary
they
bear
pain
and
disease
much
better
fevers
especially
and
for
the
same
reason
that
a
twig
is
less
hurt
by
a
storm
than
an
oak
in
all
the
other
productions
of
nature
we
see
the
greatest
vigor
and
luxuriancy
of
health
the
nearer
they
are
to
the
egg
or
bud
when
was
there
a
lamb
a
bird
or
a
tree
that
died
because
it
was
young
these
are
under
the
immediate
nursing
of
unerring
nature
and
they
thrive
accordingly
ought
it
not
therefore
to
be
the
care
of
every
nurse
and
every
parent
not
only
to
protect
their
nurslings
from
injury
but
to
be
well
assured
that
their
own
officious
services
be
not
the
greatest
evils
the
helpless
creatures
can
suffer
in
the
lower
class
of
mankind
especially
in
the
country
disease
and
mortality
are
not
so
frequent
either
among
adults
or
their
children
health
and
posterity
are
the
portion
of
the
poor
i
mean
the
laborious
the
want
of
superfluity
confines
them
more
within
the
limits
of
nature
hence
they
enjoy
the
blessings
they
feel
not
and
are
ignorant
of
their
cause
in
the
course
of
my
practice
i
have
had
frequent
occasion
to
be
fully
satisfied
of
this
and
have
often
heard
a
mother
anxiously
say
child
has
not
been
well
ever
since
it
has
done
puking
and
crying
these
complaints
though
not
attended
to
point
very
plainly
to
the
cause
is
it
not
very
evident
that
when
a
child
rids
its
stomach
of
its
contents
several
times
a
day
it
has
been
overloaded
while
the
natural
strength
lasts
for
every
child
is
born
with
more
health
and
strength
than
is
generally
imagined
it
cries
at
or
rejects
the
superfluous
load
and
that
is
grows
very
fat
bloated
and
distended
beyond
measure
like
a
house
lamb
but
in
time
the
same
oppressive
cause
continuing
the
natural
powers
are
overcome
being
no
longer
able
to
throw
off
the
unequal
weight
the
child
now
unable
to
cry
any
more
languishes
and
is
quiet
the
misfortune
is
that
these
complaints
are
not
understood
the
child
is
swaddled
and
crammed
on
till
after
gripes
purging
it
sinks
under
both
burdens
into
a
convulsion
fit
and
escapes
farther
torture
this
would
be
the
case
with
the
lamb
were
it
not
killed
when
full
fat
that
the
present
mode
of
nursing
is
wrong
one
would
think
needed
no
other
proof
than
the
frequent
miscarriages
attending
it
the
death
of
many
and
the
ill
health
of
those
that
survive
but
what
i
am
going
to
complain
of
is
that
children
in
general
are
and
and
fed
and
clothed
improperly
to
these
causes
i
attribute
almost
all
their
diseases
but
the
feeding
of
children
is
much
more
important
to
them
than
their
clothing
let
us
consider
what
nature
directs
in
the
case
if
we
follow
nature
instead
of
leading
or
driving
her
we
can
not
err
in
the
business
of
nursing
as
well
as
physic
art
if
it
do
not
exactly
copy
this
original
is
ever
destructive
if
i
could
prevail
no
child
should
ever
be
crammed
with
any
unnatural
mixture
till
the
provision
of
nature
was
ready
for
it
nor
afterwards
fed
with
any
ungenial
diet
whatever
at
least
for
the
three
for
it
is
not
well
able
to
digest
and
assimilate
other
elements
sooner
i
have
seen
very
healthy
children
that
never
ate
or
drank
anything
whatever
but
their
mother
milk
for
the
first
ten
or
twelve
months
nature
seems
to
direct
to
this
by
giving
them
no
teeth
till
about
that
time
the
call
of
nature
should
be
waited
for
to
feed
them
with
anything
more
substantial
and
the
appetite
ought
ever
to
precede
the
food
not
only
with
regard
to
the
daily
meals
but
those
changes
of
diet
which
opening
increasing
life
requires
but
this
is
never
done
in
either
case
which
is
one
of
the
greatest
mistakes
of
all
nurses
when
the
child
requires
more
solid
sustenance
we
are
to
inquire
what
and
how
much
is
most
proper
to
give
it
we
may
be
well
assured
there
is
a
great
mistake
either
in
the
quantity
or
quality
of
children
food
or
both
as
it
is
usually
given
them
because
they
are
made
sick
by
it
for
to
this
mistake
i
can
not
help
imputing
nine
in
ten
of
all
their
diseases
as
to
quantity
there
is
a
most
ridiculous
error
in
the
common
practice
for
it
is
generally
supposed
that
whenever
a
child
cries
it
wants
victuals
it
is
accordingly
fed
ten
or
twelve
or
more
times
in
a
day
and
night
this
is
so
obvious
a
misapprehension
that
i
am
surprised
it
should
ever
prevail
if
a
child
wants
and
motions
be
diligently
and
judiciously
attended
to
it
will
be
found
that
it
never
cries
but
from
pain
now
the
first
sensations
of
hunger
are
not
attended
with
pain
accordingly
a
very
young
child
that
is
hungry
will
make
a
hundred
other
signs
of
its
want
before
it
will
cry
for
food
if
it
be
healthy
and
quite
easy
in
its
dress
it
will
hardly
ever
cry
at
all
indeed
these
signs
and
motions
i
speak
of
are
but
rarely
observed
because
it
seldom
happens
that
children
are
ever
suffered
to
be
hungry
footnote
that
which
we
commonly
observe
in
them
in
such
cases
and
call
by
the
name
of
hunger
the
doctor
i
suppose
would
regard
as
morbid
or
unnatural
feeling
wholly
unworthy
of
the
name
of
hunger
in
a
few
very
few
whom
i
have
had
the
pleasure
to
see
reasonably
nursed
that
were
not
fed
above
two
or
three
times
in
hours
and
yet
were
perfectly
healthy
active
and
happy
i
have
seen
these
signals
which
were
as
intelligible
as
if
they
had
spoken
there
are
many
faults
in
the
quality
of
children
food
it
is
not
simple
enough
their
paps
panadas
gruels
are
generally
enriched
with
sugar
spices
and
other
nice
things
and
sometimes
a
drop
of
wine
none
of
which
they
ought
ever
to
take
our
bodies
never
want
them
they
are
what
luxury
only
has
introduced
to
the
destruction
of
the
health
of
mankind
it
is
not
enough
that
their
food
should
be
simple
it
should
also
be
light
many
people
i
find
are
mistaken
in
their
notions
of
what
is
light
and
fancy
that
most
kinds
of
pastry
puddings
custards
are
light
that
is
light
of
digestion
but
there
is
nothing
heavier
in
this
sense
than
unfermented
flour
and
eggs
boiled
hard
which
are
the
chief
ingredients
in
some
of
these
preparations
what
i
mean
by
light
food
to
give
the
best
idea
i
can
of
it
is
any
substance
that
is
easily
separated
and
soluble
in
warm
water
good
bread
is
the
lightest
thing
i
know
and
the
fittest
food
for
young
children
cows
milk
is
also
simple
and
light
and
very
good
for
them
but
it
is
often
injudiciously
prepared
it
should
never
be
boiled
for
boiling
alters
the
taste
and
properties
of
it
destroys
its
sweetness
and
makes
it
thicker
heavier
and
less
fit
to
mix
and
assimilate
with
the
blood
it
is
hardly
necessary
for
me
to
repeat
that
in
these
general
views
of
with
a
few
exceptions
i
entirely
concur
indeed
some
of
them
have
already
been
presented
but
i
have
expressed
my
doubts
of
the
soundness
of
his
conclusion
in
regard
to
sugar
used
with
food
in
very
small
quantity
by
persons
whose
stomachs
are
already
in
a
good
condition
both
sugar
and
molasses
especially
the
former
appear
to
me
not
only
harmless
but
wholesome
and
useful
on
the
subject
of
simplicity
in
children
food
i
should
be
glad
to
enlarge
there
is
nothing
more
important
in
diet
than
simplicity
and
yet
i
think
there
is
nothing
more
rare
to
suit
the
fashion
everything
must
be
mixed
and
varied
i
have
no
objection
to
variety
at
different
meals
both
for
children
and
adults
indeed
i
am
disposed
to
recommend
it
as
will
be
seen
hereafter
but
i
am
utterly
opposed
to
any
considerable
variety
at
the
same
meal
and
above
all
in
a
single
dish
the
simpler
a
dish
can
be
the
better
but
let
us
look
for
a
moment
at
the
dishes
of
food
which
are
often
presented
even
at
what
are
called
plain
tables
meats
can
not
be
eaten
so
many
persons
think
without
being
covered
with
mustard
or
pepper
or
gravy
or
soaked
in
vinegar
and
not
a
few
regard
them
as
insipid
unless
several
of
these
are
combined
few
people
think
a
piece
of
plain
boiled
or
broiled
muscle
lean
flesh
with
nothing
on
it
but
a
little
salt
is
fit
to
be
eaten
everything
it
is
thought
must
be
rendered
more
stimulating
or
acrid
or
must
be
swimming
in
gravy
or
melted
fat
or
butter
bread
though
proverbially
the
staff
of
life
can
scarcely
be
eaten
in
its
simple
state
it
must
be
buttered
or
honied
or
toasted
or
soaked
in
milk
or
dipped
in
gravy
puddings
must
have
cherries
or
fruits
of
some
sort
or
spices
in
them
and
must
be
sweetened
largely
or
perhaps
more
ridiculous
still
they
must
have
suet
in
them
and
after
all
this
is
done
who
can
eat
them
without
the
addition
of
sauce
or
butter
or
molasses
or
cream
potatoes
boiled
steamed
or
roasted
delightful
as
they
are
to
an
unperverted
appetite
are
yet
thought
by
many
people
hardly
palatable
till
they
are
mashed
and
buttered
or
gravied
or
perhaps
soaked
in
vinegar
in
short
the
plainest
and
simplest
article
for
the
table
is
deemed
nearly
unfit
for
the
stomach
till
it
has
been
buttered
and
peppered
and
spiced
and
perhaps
even
bread
and
milk
must
be
filled
with
berries
or
fruits
where
can
you
find
many
adults
who
would
relish
a
meal
which
should
consist
entirely
of
plain
bread
without
any
addition
of
plain
potatoes
without
anything
on
them
except
a
little
salt
of
a
plain
rice
pudding
and
nothing
with
it
or
of
plain
baked
or
boiled
apples
or
pears
and
such
persons
be
found
how
many
of
them
would
bring
up
their
children
to
live
on
such
plain
dishes
it
need
not
be
wondered
at
that
a
palate
which
has
been
so
long
tickled
by
variety
and
by
so
many
stimulating
mixtures
of
food
should
come
to
regard
cold
water
for
drink
as
insipid
and
should
feel
dissatisfied
with
it
and
desirous
of
boiling
some
narcotic
or
poisonous
herb
in
it
or
brewing
it
with
something
which
will
impart
to
it
more
or
less
of
alcohol
the
wonder
is
not
that
some
of
our
epicures
become
drunkards
but
that
all
of
them
do
not
cadogan
alludes
to
a
sad
mistake
everywhere
made
about
food
and
condemns
very
justly
custards
pastry
it
is
very
strange
that
these
substances
for
these
are
among
the
injurious
articles
which
i
call
mixtures
should
ever
have
obtained
currency
in
the
world
to
the
exclusion
of
bread
which
as
the
same
writer
justly
says
is
among
the
lightest
articles
of
food
which
are
known
it
is
strange
in
particular
what
views
people
have
about
bread
judging
from
what
i
see
i
am
compelled
to
believe
that
there
are
few
who
regard
it
in
any
other
light
than
as
a
kind
of
necessary
evil
they
appear
to
eat
it
not
because
they
are
fond
of
it
by
itself
but
because
they
eat
it
or
rather
because
it
is
a
fashionable
article
and
not
to
make
believe
they
eat
it
at
the
least
would
be
unfashionable
they
will
get
rid
of
it
however
when
they
can
and
when
they
must
eat
it
they
soak
it
or
cover
it
with
butter
or
milk
or
something
else
which
will
render
it
tolerable
or
toast
it
and
use
it
as
they
may
it
must
be
hot
from
the
oven
after
it
is
once
cold
very
few
will
eat
it
the
idea
above
all
of
making
a
full
meal
of
simple
cold
bread
hours
old
would
be
rejected
by
persons
in
a
hundred
and
by
some
with
abhorrence
people
not
only
dislike
bread
but
regard
it
as
unnutritious
i
have
heard
many
a
fond
parent
say
to
the
child
who
ate
no
meat
and
seemed
to
depend
almost
wholly
on
bread
why
my
dear
child
you
will
starve
if
you
eat
no
meat
do
at
least
put
some
butter
on
your
bread
or
your
potatoes
a
thousand
times
have
i
been
admonished
when
eating
my
vegetable
dinner
during
the
hot
and
fatiguing
days
of
summer
for
i
was
bred
to
the
farm
and
ate
little
or
no
meat
till
i
was
fourteen
years
of
age
to
eat
more
butter
or
cheese
or
something
that
would
give
me
strength
for
i
could
not
work
they
said
without
something
more
nourishing
than
bread
and
the
other
vegetables
and
yet
few
if
any
boys
of
my
age
did
more
work
or
performed
it
better
or
with
more
ease
than
myself
and
i
early
observed
the
same
thing
in
other
vegetable
eaters
the
truth
is
there
is
nothing
in
the
world
better
adapted
to
the
daily
wants
of
the
human
stomach
than
good
bread
and
few
things
more
nutritious
there
may
be
a
little
more
nutriment
in
eggs
or
jelly
but
if
the
former
are
the
stomach
can
not
digest
them
and
fat
meat
of
any
kind
is
digested
with
great
difficulty
indeed
it
is
doubtful
whether
stomachs
in
temperate
climates
digest
fat
at
all
they
may
dissolve
it
but
that
is
not
making
good
chyle
of
it
they
may
even
reduce
it
to
chyle
chyle
is
not
fat
may
slip
through
the
system
without
much
of
it
and
i
think
it
pretty
evident
that
it
usually
does
so
the
muscle
the
lean
part
of
animals
may
be
nearly
as
nutritious
as
good
bread
and
is
more
easily
digested
but
it
is
very
far
from
being
proved
that
for
the
healthy
those
things
are
always
best
which
are
most
easily
digested
nobody
will
pretend
that
potatoes
are
better
for
us
than
bread
and
yet
the
experiments
of
beaumont
seem
to
prove
that
boiled
or
roasted
potatoes
are
much
more
quick
and
easy
of
digestion
than
bread
of
the
first
and
best
quality
even
eggs
and
raw
cabbage
bad
as
they
are
are
dissolved
in
the
stomach
and
appear
to
be
digested
as
quick
if
not
quicker
than
good
wheat
bread
but
nobody
in
the
world
will
pretend
they
form
more
wholesome
food
neither
is
meat
even
meat
necessarily
more
wholesome
or
better
calculated
to
give
strength
than
bread
simply
be
cause
it
is
more
quickly
and
easily
digested
it
would
be
nearer
the
truth
to
say
that
those
substances
which
digest
slowest
provided
they
do
not
irritate
are
best
adapted
to
the
wants
of
the
human
stomach
the
philosopher
locke
perhaps
from
his
knowledge
of
medicine
gives
some
excellent
directions
on
this
subject
great
care
should
be
used
be
says
that
the
child
eat
bread
plentifully
both
alone
and
with
everything
else
and
whatever
he
eats
that
is
solid
make
him
chew
it
well
this
writer
by
the
way
supposed
that
the
teeth
were
made
to
be
used
in
beating
our
food
and
that
we
ought
neither
to
swallow
it
without
chewing
as
is
customary
in
our
busy
new
england
nor
to
mash
or
soak
it
in
order
to
save
the
labor
of
mastication
a
practice
almost
equally
universal
but
let
us
hear
his
own
words
as
for
his
diet
it
ought
to
be
very
plain
and
simple
and
if
i
might
advise
flesh
should
be
forborne
at
least
till
he
is
two
or
three
years
old
but
of
whatever
advantage
this
may
be
to
his
future
health
and
strength
i
fear
it
will
hardly
be
consented
to
by
parents
misled
by
the
custom
of
eating
too
much
flesh
themselves
who
will
be
apt
to
think
their
children
as
they
do
themselves
in
danger
to
be
starved
if
they
have
not
flesh
at
least
twice
a
day
this
i
am
sure
children
would
breed
their
teeth
with
much
less
danger
be
freer
from
diseases
while
they
were
little
and
lay
the
foundations
of
a
healthy
and
strong
constitution
much
surer
if
they
were
not
crammed
so
much
as
they
are
by
fond
mothers
and
foolish
servants
and
were
kept
wholly
from
flesh
the
first
three
or
four
years
of
their
lives
were
locke
still
living
i
should
like
to
interrogate
him
at
this
place
he
first
speaks
of
giving
children
no
meat
till
they
are
two
or
three
years
old
and
then
afterwards
extends
the
period
to
three
or
four
the
question
i
would
put
is
this
if
the
child
is
healthier
without
meat
till
he
is
three
or
four
years
old
why
not
till
he
is
thirteen
or
fourteen
or
even
till
thirty
or
forty
or
seventy
and
is
not
professor
stuart
of
andover
a
meat
eater
himself
and
an
advocate
for
its
moderate
use
by
those
who
have
already
been
trained
to
the
use
of
it
is
not
the
professor
i
say
more
than
half
right
when
he
asserts
as
i
have
heard
him
that
it
may
be
well
to
train
all
children
from
the
first
to
the
exclusive
use
of
vegetable
food
i
have
a
few
more
extracts
from
locke
particularly
on
the
subject
of
bread
i
should
think
that
a
good
piece
of
well
made
and
well
baked
brown
bread
would
be
often
the
best
breakfast
for
my
young
master
i
am
sure
it
is
as
wholesome
and
will
make
him
as
strong
a
man
as
greater
delicacies
and
if
he
be
used
to
it
it
will
be
as
pleasant
to
him
if
he
at
any
time
call
for
victuals
between
meals
use
him
to
nothing
but
dry
bread
if
he
be
hungry
more
than
wanton
bread
will
go
down
and
if
he
be
not
hungry
it
is
not
fit
that
he
should
eat
by
this
you
will
obtain
two
good
effects
first
that
by
custom
he
will
come
to
be
in
love
with
bread
for
as
i
said
our
palates
and
stomachs
too
are
pleased
with
the
things
we
are
used
to
another
good
you
will
gain
hereby
is
that
you
will
not
teach
him
to
eat
more
nor
oftener
than
nature
requires
i
do
not
think
that
all
people
appetites
are
alike
some
have
naturally
stronger
and
some
weaker
stomachs
but
this
i
think
that
many
are
made
gormands
and
gluttons
by
custom
that
were
not
so
by
nature
and
i
see
in
some
countries
men
as
lusty
and
strong
that
eat
but
two
meals
a
day
as
those
that
have
set
their
stomachs
by
a
constant
usage
to
call
on
them
for
four
or
five
the
romans
usually
fasted
till
supper
the
only
set
meal
even
of
those
who
ate
more
than
once
in
a
day
and
those
who
used
breakfasts
as
some
did
at
eight
same
at
ten
others
at
twelve
of
the
clock
and
some
later
neither
ate
flesh
nor
had
anything
made
ready
for
them
augustus
when
the
greatest
monarch
on
the
earth
tells
us
he
took
a
piece
of
dry
bread
in
his
chariot
and
seneca
in
his
epistle
giving
an
account
how
be
managed
himself
when
he
was
old
and
his
age
permitted
indulgence
says
that
he
used
to
eat
a
piece
of
dry
bread
for
his
dinner
without
the
formality
of
sitting
to
it
yet
seneca
as
it
is
well
known
was
wealthy
the
masters
of
the
world
were
brought
up
with
this
spare
diet
and
the
young
gentlemen
of
rome
felt
no
want
of
strength
or
spirit
because
they
ate
but
once
a
day
or
if
it
happened
by
chance
that
any
one
could
not
fast
so
long
as
till
supper
their
only
set
meal
he
took
nothing
but
a
bit
of
dry
bread
or
at
most
a
few
raisins
or
some
such
slight
thing
with
it
to
stay
his
stomach
and
more
than
one
set
meal
a
day
was
thought
so
monstrous
that
it
was
a
reproach
as
low
as
caesar
time
to
make
an
entertainment
or
sit
down
to
a
table
till
towards
sunset
therefore
i
judge
it
most
convenient
that
my
young
master
should
have
nothing
but
bread
for
breakfast
i
impute
a
great
part
of
our
diseases
in
england
to
our
eating
too
much
flesh
and
too
little
bread
dry
bread
though
the
best
nourishment
has
the
least
temptation
i
shall
not
undertake
to
defend
all
the
sentiments
of
locke
in
these
extracts
but
in
regard
to
the
main
point
the
nutritive
properties
and
wholesome
tendency
of
bread
and
the
importance
of
making
it
a
principal
article
of
diet
for
children
i
think
his
views
are
just
in
short
they
do
not
differ
substantially
from
those
of
a
large
proportion
of
the
best
writers
on
this
subject
in
every
country
during
the
last
three
hundred
years
as
if
with
one
voice
they
dissuade
from
the
use
of
too
much
animal
food
for
the
young
and
encourage
the
use
of
a
larger
proportion
of
vegetable
food
bread
plain
puddings
rice
potatoes
turnips
beets
apples
pears
and
milk
yet
they
all
or
nearly
all
seem
to
write
just
as
if
they
did
not
expect
to
be
believed
or
if
believed
to
be
followed
they
seem
to
regard
mankind
as
so
inveterately
attached
to
old
habits
and
so
much
addicted
to
flesh
eating
that
there
is
little
hope
of
reclaiming
them
now
though
my
opinions
are
no
more
entitled
to
respect
than
many
of
theirs
i
hope
for
greater
success
than
they
appear
to
do
i
expect
that
many
young
mothers
who
read
this
work
will
be
led
to
think
and
inquire
further
on
the
subject
and
if
they
find
that
the
views
here
advanced
are
in
accordance
with
reason
and
common
sense
and
higher
authority
i
am
not
without
hope
that
they
will
reform
and
do
what
they
can
to
reform
their
neighbors
i
have
dwelt
the
longer
in
this
section
on
the
principles
of
diet
because
i
am
of
opinion
that
whatever
is
true
on
this
subject
in
regard
to
the
diet
of
children
soon
after
weaning
is
equally
or
nearly
equally
applicable
to
the
whole
of
childhood
youth
manhood
and
age
it
is
not
true
that
one
period
of
life
and
one
mode
of
employment
demands
a
diet
essentially
different
from
that
which
is
demanded
at
another
period
and
in
other
circumstances
provided
always
that
the
individual
is
in
health
occasional
instances
of
the
kind
there
may
be
but
they
are
not
numerous
the
digestive
powers
of
the
young
are
more
nearly
as
strong
as
those
of
the
adult
than
is
usually
admitted
and
they
are
much
more
active
they
require
a
less
quantity
of
food
undoubtedly
and
they
should
be
fed
at
shorter
intervals
but
as
a
general
rule
what
is
best
for
them
as
regards
its
quality
at
three
years
old
is
best
for
them
at
thirty
or
should
they
live
so
long
at
ninety
i
repeat
it
there
is
very
little
difference
in
the
nature
of
the
food
required
ever
after
teething
let
me
not
be
understood
as
saying
that
the
strong
and
the
robust
and
the
active
can
not
digest
food
which
the
weak
and
enervated
and
indolent
can
not
undoubtedly
they
can
but
this
does
not
prove
that
they
to
do
it
it
does
not
prove
that
their
strength
and
vigor
were
not
given
them
for
other
purposes
than
to
be
expended
on
the
poorer
substances
for
food
when
they
might
have
better
nor
is
it
true
as
often
pretended
that
the
hard
laborer
needs
either
more
food
or
that
which
is
of
a
stronger
quality
just
in
proportion
to
the
severity
of
his
labor
the
man
or
the
child
who
labors
moderately
just
sufficient
for
the
purposes
of
health
and
labors
with
his
hands
in
the
open
air
needs
rather
food
than
the
indolent
or
the
sedentary
or
those
who
labor
to
excess
but
not
that
which
is
of
a
stronger
quality
it
is
he
who
labors
to
excess
if
any
difference
of
quality
were
required
at
all
who
should
eat
milder
food
as
well
as
less
in
quantity
some
physicians
there
are
who
tell
us
that
all
mankind
would
live
longer
as
well
as
be
more
healthful
if
they
ate
nothing
but
bread
and
drank
nothing
but
water
it
may
be
so
but
i
do
not
believe
it
water
as
i
shall
show
hereafter
is
indeed
the
only
appropriate
drink
but
i
do
not
believe
that
bread
even
after
the
second
year
is
in
all
cases
and
circumstances
the
best
food
besides
that
the
experiments
of
majendie
and
other
physiologists
go
a
little
way
though
not
far
i
confess
to
prove
that
animals
generally
and
if
so
why
not
man
as
well
as
the
rest
thrive
best
with
some
degree
of
variety
in
their
food
it
seems
to
me
more
in
accordance
with
the
general
intentions
of
the
creator
so
far
as
we
can
discover
what
they
are
while
therefore
i
deny
that
either
milk
or
bread
is
better
in
all
cases
for
human
sustenance
than
any
other
articles
of
food
i
must
at
the
same
time
be
permitted
to
regard
them
as
among
the
best
and
as
deserving
more
general
attention
every
infant
after
leaving
the
breast
should
as
it
seems
to
me
make
bread
in
some
of
its
forms
a
chief
article
of
food
this
article
so
justly
and
emphatically
called
the
staff
of
life
may
be
found
in
almost
every
country
common
sense
seems
to
have
dictated
the
propriety
of
its
use
though
fashion
has
often
led
us
to
overlook
or
despise
it
like
air
and
fire
and
water
and
nearly
every
other
common
but
indispensable
blessing
the
best
kind
of
bread
is
made
from
wheat
the
worst
from
bark
wood
and
bark
afford
so
little
nutriment
that
it
is
only
in
such
countries
as
norway
sweden
lapland
iceland
greenland
and
siberia
that
the
inhabitants
can
be
induced
to
make
use
of
them
here
they
are
often
useful
either
because
people
can
not
get
food
which
is
better
or
to
blend
with
their
fat
or
oily
animal
food
for
it
should
never
be
forgotten
that
healthy
digestion
requires
a
large
proportion
of
innutritious
matter
along
with
the
pure
nutriment
in
order
to
make
bread
from
wheat
the
meal
should
not
be
bolted
if
it
seems
to
contain
particles
which
are
too
coarse
it
may
be
well
to
pass
it
through
a
coarse
family
sieve
but
the
best
bread
i
have
ever
eaten
as
well
as
the
cleanest
and
neatest
was
not
sifted
at
all
i
know
there
is
an
almost
universal
prejudice
against
this
sort
of
bread
some
complain
that
it
scratches
their
throats
others
that
it
is
tasteless
and
others
still
that
it
does
not
agree
with
them
with
others
there
is
another
objection
which
is
that
bread
of
this
sort
has
sometimes
been
called
bread
and
with
others
still
that
it
has
been
called
bread
either
of
these
appellations
seems
sufficient
to
condemn
it
now
as
to
the
harshness
this
is
owing
to
its
being
made
of
bad
materials
or
to
its
being
baked
too
hard
or
kept
too
long
much
of
what
they
call
dyspepsia
bread
in
our
cities
is
evidently
made
by
mixing
the
bran
and
flour
of
wheat
after
they
have
been
once
separated
besides
which
in
not
a
few
cases
the
finest
of
the
flour
appears
to
be
taken
away
now
bread
made
of
such
materials
thus
combined
will
always
be
darker
colored
as
well
as
harsher
than
when
made
from
the
wheat
simply
ground
without
any
bolting
and
wet
up
in
the
usual
manner
such
bread
is
best
two
or
three
days
old
after
four
days
it
becomes
dry
and
somewhat
harsh
they
who
complain
that
such
bread
is
insipid
are
persons
whose
appetites
have
been
injured
by
food
which
is
and
who
if
they
eat
bread
at
all
must
eat
it
hot
or
soaked
in
butter
no
wonder
such
persons
do
not
like
plain
bread
and
say
it
is
tasteless
but
it
must
not
be
denied
that
bakers
often
suffer
this
kind
of
bread
to
be
in
order
to
make
it
sufficiently
light
and
porous
this
renders
it
less
tasteful
and
from
the
saleratus
they
use
less
wholesome
no
child
who
has
been
accustomed
from
the
first
to
good
wheaten
bread
made
of
unbolted
meal
and
not
less
than
one
day
old
will
ever
prefer
any
other
until
he
has
been
rendered
capricious
on
this
subject
and
wishes
to
change
for
the
sake
of
changing
or
until
he
has
been
misled
by
surrounding
example
i
speak
from
observation
when
i
say
that
infants
whose
habits
have
not
been
depraved
will
not
prefer
hot
bread
of
any
kind
it
is
hot
mother
i
have
heard
them
say
as
an
apology
for
refusing
a
piece
of
bread
but
never
it
is
cold
or
it
is
too
old
it
is
the
epicurean
it
is
he
with
whom
it
is
a
sufficient
objection
to
any
kind
of
food
whatever
that
he
has
used
it
for
several
successive
meals
or
days
that
is
most
ready
to
complain
of
good
bread
he
whose
habits
are
correct
and
who
is
the
more
unwilling
to
change
any
of
his
articles
of
diet
the
longer
he
has
been
in
the
use
of
them
and
who
only
changes
them
or
uses
variety
from
principle
he
i
say
will
never
complain
of
harshness
or
want
of
taste
in
good
wheat
bread
nor
will
it
be
an
objection
of
weight
with
him
that
has
recommended
it
or
that
it
has
either
prevented
or
cured
nor
will
the
epicurean
himself
complain
that
bread
is
insipid
after
being
confined
to
it
for
a
month
or
six
weeks
he
will
then
find
a
sweetness
in
it
for
which
he
had
long
sought
in
vain
in
the
more
delicate
and
costly
viands
of
a
luxurious
and
expensive
and
unchristian
modern
table
it
is
they
only
who
observe
simplicity
and
confine
themselves
to
very
plain
food
who
truly
enjoy
pleasure
in
eating
the
bulk
of
mankind
benumb
their
sense
of
taste
by
their
food
and
drink
and
by
such
constant
variety
and
strange
mixtures
and
thus
in
their
eager
cry
who
will
show
us
any
good
they
actually
enjoy
less
than
he
who
eats
plain
food
and
is
contented
with
it
bread
of
all
kinds
is
greatly
improved
in
whiteness
and
pleasantness
by
being
wet
with
milk
though
even
when
wet
with
nothing
but
water
there
is
a
solid
and
rational
sweetness
to
it
of
which
the
despisers
of
bread
and
devourers
of
much
flesh
and
condiments
never
dreamed
and
never
will
dream
till
they
reform
their
habits
if
children
are
furnished
with
good
bread
on
the
plan
of
locke
there
is
no
doubt
that
they
will
relish
it
most
keenly
that
their
attachment
to
it
will
strengthen
and
that
unless
we
give
them
other
food
occasionally
from
principle
or
seduce
them
by
depraving
their
tastes
they
will
continue
it
through
life
train
up
a
child
in
the
way
he
should
go
and
when
he
is
old
he
will
not
depart
from
it
is
a
general
rule
and
has
as
few
exceptions
when
applied
to
the
diet
of
a
child
as
when
it
is
applied
to
his
moral
tastes
and
preferences
with
those
parents
who
though
convinced
of
the
justness
of
the
views
here
advanced
have
already
trained
their
children
in
the
way
they
should
go
but
are
anxious
to
retrace
their
steps
as
far
as
possible
there
will
here
be
a
difficulty
our
children
they
will
say
do
not
at
present
the
kind
of
bread
you
speak
of
and
how
shall
we
bring
them
to
do
so
or
is
the
thing
indeed
possible
the
answer
to
these
inquiries
is
easy
such
parents
have
only
to
confine
their
children
to
the
kinds
of
food
which
they
deem
proper
for
them
a
few
weeks
or
a
few
months
and
they
will
soon
relish
them
if
those
who
are
old
enough
to
be
convinced
can
be
brought
to
unite
heartily
in
the
change
and
to
endeavor
to
be
pleased
with
it
the
work
of
reformation
will
be
more
pleasant
and
probably
more
speedy
i
have
never
found
any
difficulty
of
bringing
myself
to
relish
in
a
very
short
time
an
article
of
food
for
which
i
had
no
relish
before
and
to
which
i
had
even
a
dislike
provided
i
was
thoroughly
convinced
it
was
best
for
me
and
was
earnest
in
the
desire
of
change
except
sweet
oil
to
which
i
was
about
six
months
in
becoming
reconciled
it
is
with
physical
as
with
moral
habits
in
their
formation
we
should
fix
on
what
we
believe
from
experience
observation
and
divine
and
human
testimony
is
best
for
us
and
habit
will
soon
render
it
agreeable
it
is
important
even
to
health
that
food
should
be
agreeable
but
as
i
have
already
said
what
we
know
to
be
best
for
us
will
soon
become
agreeable
if
we
confine
ourselves
to
it
and
to
our
children
also
if
we
confine
them
to
it
in
like
manner
next
to
bread
made
of
wheat
when
that
can
not
be
procured
is
a
mixture
of
wheat
and
indian
meal
but
the
proportion
of
the
latter
should
be
the
smallest
wheat
rye
and
indian
in
the
proportion
of
one
third
of
each
make
excellent
bread
sometimes
called
bread
rye
and
indian
make
a
tolerable
bread
rye
alone
is
not
so
good
the
want
in
the
latter
of
the
vegetable
principle
called
gluten
makes
its
general
use
of
very
questionable
propriety
indian
meal
alone
baked
in
cakes
by
the
fire
if
eaten
only
in
small
quantities
is
a
very
nutritious
and
by
no
means
unwholesome
bread
but
its
sweetness
and
the
general
fondness
which
people
who
are
accustomed
to
its
use
have
for
it
lead
them
to
eat
it
in
too
large
proportions
if
they
use
it
while
it
is
warm
in
these
circumstances
it
proves
itself
too
active
for
the
stomach
and
bowels
if
warm
six
ounces
is
as
much
as
a
hearty
adult
ought
to
eat
of
it
at
once
and
children
should
of
course
take
much
less
it
is
less
active
on
the
bowels
and
scarcely
less
agreeable
as
soon
as
we
become
accustomed
to
it
if
eaten
when
it
is
cold
even
if
baked
in
loaves
in
the
oven
potatoes
added
to
unbolted
wheat
flour
make
excellent
bread
and
so
as
i
am
informed
does
rice
of
the
latter
however
i
have
never
eaten
oats
and
barley
and
many
other
grains
and
substances
will
make
bread
but
it
is
of
an
inferior
kind
the
question
may
again
recur
after
this
extended
series
of
remarks
whether
i
intend
to
confine
the
young
almost
exclusively
to
bread
in
one
or
another
of
its
forms
we
shall
see
how
this
is
presently
while
bread
therefore
should
constitute
a
part
at
least
and
sometimes
the
whole
of
a
meal
a
great
variety
of
other
articles
are
not
only
admissible
but
desirable
among
these
may
be
mentioned
plain
puddings
one
of
the
most
wholesome
puddings
is
made
of
indian
meal
enclosed
in
a
bag
and
boiled
nearly
allied
to
this
is
the
common
hasty
pudding
but
the
last
is
less
wholesome
because
it
requires
less
chewing
and
it
ought
to
have
been
observed
before
now
that
after
weaning
any
food
is
digested
better
which
has
undergone
the
process
of
thorough
mastication
boiled
rice
though
hardly
to
be
regarded
as
a
pudding
is
very
nutritious
and
very
easy
of
digestion
i
am
not
without
doubts
however
in
regard
to
the
utility
of
a
large
proportion
of
rice
as
food
a
dinner
of
it
two
or
three
times
a
week
i
believe
to
be
wholesome
but
used
too
frequently
it
seems
to
me
not
active
enough
for
the
stomach
and
bowels
having
in
this
respect
precisely
a
contrary
effect
to
that
of
warm
indian
cakes
the
common
notion
that
rice
has
a
tendency
to
make
people
blind
is
entirely
unfounded
its
worst
effect
is
when
eaten
without
being
boiled
through
in
such
cases
i
have
known
it
to
do
mischief
perhaps
because
it
was
swallowed
without
much
chewing
some
grind
it
and
use
the
flour
but
i
can
not
recommend
it
to
be
used
in
this
manner
the
best
pudding
in
the
world
is
a
loaf
of
bread
what
you
will
say
bread
again
three
or
four
or
five
days
old
boiled
or
rather
in
milk
all
kinds
of
bread
are
excellent
for
this
purpose
but
wheat
and
indian
are
the
best
they
are
excellent
even
without
milk
that
is
simply
steamed
puddings
made
of
the
flour
of
wheat
rye
buckwheat
are
less
wholesome
than
those
which
have
been
already
mentioned
and
all
sorts
of
puddings
are
less
wholesome
when
eaten
as
hot
as
our
unreasonable
fashions
require
than
when
their
temperature
is
quite
below
that
of
our
bodies
i
would
not
have
them
so
cold
as
to
chill
us
for
this
would
be
to
go
to
the
other
though
less
dangerous
extreme
but
they
ought
to
be
cool
too
much
heat
is
an
unnatural
stimulus
likely
to
leave
more
or
less
debility
behind
it
in
addition
to
this
those
who
eat
hot
food
are
more
exposed
to
take
cold
in
consequence
of
it
with
none
of
these
puddings
ought
we
to
mix
any
fruits
green
or
dried
not
even
raisins
some
of
the
more
important
properties
of
nearly
every
kind
of
fruit
or
berry
are
lost
by
boiling
unless
we
eat
the
water
in
which
they
are
boiled
and
save
the
vapor
which
would
otherwise
escape
i
am
not
in
favor
of
boiled
fruit
generally
especially
if
boiled
in
puddings
puddings
like
most
other
kinds
of
food
even
bread
may
be
slightly
salted
not
that
this
is
indispensable
but
because
the
balance
of
human
testimony
is
in
its
favor
the
argument
that
we
evidently
need
salt
because
the
other
animals
require
it
is
without
much
weight
the
other
animals
do
not
require
or
use
it
footnote
some
considerable
savage
nations
use
no
salt
and
a
few
have
a
strong
aversion
to
it
the
cases
so
often
triumphantly
mentioned
where
animals
appear
to
thrive
better
from
the
use
of
it
are
only
exceptions
to
the
general
rule
nor
are
they
very
numerous
in
comparison
with
the
whole
race
of
animals
still
i
have
no
objections
to
its
moderate
use
it
may
be
useful
in
preventing
worms
though
there
are
doubts
even
of
that
in
large
quantities
it
is
unquestionably
hurtful
but
neither
fruits
nor
berries
permit
me
to
repeat
the
sentiment
no
nor
any
such
thing
as
cinnamon
or
spices
nor
even
sugar
or
molasses
in
any
considerable
quantity
should
go
into
the
composition
of
any
sort
of
pudding
if
the
puddings
are
not
sweet
enough
without
it
is
better
to
add
a
little
sugar
or
molasses
on
your
plate
nor
should
sauces
or
cream
or
butter
or
suet
be
used
in
or
upon
them
though
of
all
these
substances
cream
is
least
injurious
nutmegs
grated
cheese
are
unnecessary
and
hurtful
cheese
should
never
be
eaten
in
any
way
there
is
one
thing
however
which
may
be
eaten
in
moderate
quantity
with
all
sorts
of
puddings
and
with
bread
i
mean
milk
i
say
eaten
for
it
is
better
never
to
put
these
substances
nor
indeed
any
other
the
milk
the
bread
pudding
should
be
eaten
by
itself
and
the
milk
by
itself
also
in
this
way
we
shall
not
be
liable
to
cheat
the
teeth
out
of
what
is
justly
their
due
and
then
make
the
deranged
stomach
and
general
system
pay
for
it
potatoes
are
a
good
article
of
diet
to
be
used
once
a
day
though
they
are
not
very
nutritious
they
are
best
either
steamed
or
roasted
in
the
ashes
they
are
also
excellent
when
boiled
turnips
are
also
good
onions
are
not
so
useful
as
is
generally
supposed
except
for
the
purposes
of
medicine
beets
in
small
quantity
and
carrots
and
asparagus
and
above
all
beans
and
peas
but
not
their
pods
are
tolerable
food
once
a
day
during
most
of
the
year
except
it
be
the
middle
of
the
winter
but
neither
these
nor
potatoes
nor
any
other
vegetables
ought
to
be
cooked
in
any
way
with
fat
or
fat
meat
or
butter
or
be
mashed
after
they
are
cooked
or
eaten
with
oil
or
butter
if
there
be
an
exception
to
this
general
rule
which
may
seem
to
be
rather
sweeping
it
should
be
in
favor
of
a
little
sweet
oil
on
rice
or
on
bread
puddings
but
the
common
practice
founded
upon
the
apparent
belief
that
we
can
scarcely
eat
anything
until
it
is
well
covered
with
lard
or
butter
is
quite
objectionable
nay
it
is
even
disgusting
no
pure
stomach
would
ever
prefer
oily
bread
or
pudding
or
beans
or
peas
and
most
people
would
abhor
the
sight
of
such
a
strange
combination
were
not
habit
in
its
power
to
change
our
very
nature
almost
omnipotent
sec
on
there
is
a
very
great
diversity
of
opinion
on
the
subject
of
fruit
some
maintain
that
all
fruit
even
in
the
most
ripe
and
perfect
state
is
of
doubtful
utility
especially
for
children
others
say
none
is
hurtful
if
ripe
and
eaten
in
moderate
quantity
some
require
care
in
making
a
proper
selection
but
here
again
in
regard
to
what
constitutes
a
proper
selection
there
is
a
difference
of
opinion
some
consider
fruits
easy
of
digestion
others
believe
they
are
digested
only
with
very
great
difficulty
when
the
cholera
prevailed
in
the
large
cities
of
the
united
states
a
majority
of
the
physicians
believed
all
fruits
even
those
which
were
ripe
to
be
injurious
in
their
tendency
but
it
was
insisted
by
the
minority
i
think
very
justly
that
whenever
fruit
appeared
to
be
injurious
it
was
accidental
that
is
the
disease
being
prepared
to
make
its
attack
just
at
that
time
happened
to
do
so
immediately
after
the
use
of
fruit
rather
than
something
else
and
especially
in
the
of
fruits
or
on
account
of
excess
or
which
was
certainly
the
case
in
some
instances
because
the
quality
of
the
fruit
was
bad
at
present
the
of
testimony
on
this
subject
estimating
according
to
talent
and
not
according
to
numbers
is
in
favor
of
good
fruit
used
with
moderation
even
in
the
face
of
the
cholera
dunglison
one
of
the
last
to
adopt
such
an
opinion
appears
to
be
in
its
favor
on
several
points
in
regard
to
fruit
i
believe
that
among
medical
men
there
is
no
essential
difference
of
opinion
as
i
always
prefer
in
controversies
to
see
in
how
many
things
antagonists
agree
before
proceeding
to
the
points
in
which
they
differ
i
will
here
endeavor
to
enumerate
them
all
unripe
fruits
especially
if
eaten
raw
and
uncooked
let
the
season
or
prevalent
disease
or
individual
be
what
or
who
it
may
are
unwholesome
excess
in
the
use
of
the
most
wholesome
fruits
under
any
circumstances
is
also
injurious
fruits
eaten
immediately
after
a
full
meal
when
the
stomach
is
in
an
improper
condition
for
receiving
anything
more
contribute
to
overtask
the
digestive
powers
and
must
hence
produce
more
or
less
of
injury
the
skins
and
kernels
of
the
larger
fruits
are
unwholesome
because
indigestible
the
skins
of
fruits
if
beaten
or
masticated
finely
may
appear
to
be
digested
because
dissolved
but
i
have
already
endeavored
to
show
that
solution
is
not
always
digestion
fruits
of
all
kinds
are
most
wholesome
in
their
own
country
and
in
their
own
appropriate
season
dried
fruits
are
less
wholesome
than
fresh
fruit
of
all
kinds
should
be
withheld
from
infants
until
they
have
teeth
thus
far
as
i
have
already
said
all
agree
at
least
so
far
as
i
know
there
are
several
other
points
on
which
medical
men
are
generally
agreed
though
not
universally
one
of
these
is
that
fruits
if
eaten
at
all
should
usually
form
a
part
of
a
regular
meal
another
is
that
it
is
better
not
to
eat
them
immediately
before
going
to
bed
there
are
contradictory
opinions
among
the
mass
of
the
community
physicians
as
well
as
others
on
the
general
intention
of
our
summer
fruits
from
the
fact
that
children
diseases
prevail
more
at
the
season
of
the
year
when
fruits
are
more
abundant
many
think
the
fruits
are
the
immediate
cause
of
them
others
and
with
better
reason
suppose
that
the
latter
are
intended
by
the
author
of
nature
to
check
or
prevent
the
bowel
diseases
of
summer
nothing
certainly
is
more
unnatural
than
to
suppose
that
at
the
very
season
of
the
year
when
so
many
other
influences
combine
to
awaken
a
tendency
to
disease
in
the
human
system
the
creator
should
place
before
our
eyes
an
abundance
of
fruits
inviting
us
by
all
their
cooling
and
tempting
properties
only
to
do
us
mischief
on
the
contrary
it
seems
to
me
much
more
probable
that
many
of
them
were
designed
for
our
moderate
use
in
what
quantity
under
what
circumstances
and
which
are
best
it
is
left
to
human
experience
to
determine
some
say
that
fruit
should
never
be
eaten
in
the
morning
before
breakfast
now
everything
i
know
of
the
human
constitution
together
with
what
i
have
learned
from
experience
and
observation
has
been
for
years
leading
me
to
the
contrary
opinion
indeed
i
am
most
fully
convinced
that
of
all
periods
for
eating
fruit
whether
we
use
it
alone
or
make
it
a
part
of
our
regular
meals
the
morning
soon
after
we
rise
is
the
most
favorable
footnote
i
ought
to
remark
that
as
the
morning
is
the
best
time
for
eating
fruit
so
it
is
the
very
worst
time
for
eating
it
if
good
and
as
a
large
proportion
of
that
which
is
eaten
is
unripe
or
otherwise
bad
this
may
account
for
the
general
prejudice
against
eating
it
at
this
period
my
reasons
are
as
follows
the
rest
and
sleep
of
the
preceding
night
has
restored
our
general
vigor
and
consequently
has
invigorated
the
stomach
so
that
digestion
will
be
more
easily
and
perfectly
accomplished
we
have
been
at
our
rising
so
long
without
food
on
our
stomachs
that
they
are
not
likely
to
be
oppressed
by
a
moderate
quantity
of
good
ripe
wholesome
fruit
in
the
course
of
our
waking
hours
meals
follow
each
other
in
such
quick
succession
and
there
is
so
much
variety
even
at
the
plainest
tables
to
tempt
us
to
excess
that
there
is
more
danger
of
injury
from
the
addition
of
fruit
than
at
our
first
rising
i
have
never
known
any
one
to
receive
injury
from
the
use
of
fruit
in
this
way
provided
no
other
circumstance
in
relation
to
quantity
quality
had
been
disregarded
in
my
own
case
the
practice
has
on
the
contrary
seemed
beneficial
there
is
one
reason
in
favor
of
this
practice
which
perhaps
would
have
less
weight
if
people
rose
as
early
in
the
morning
as
they
ought
or
in
the
language
of
franklin
to
the
inhabitants
of
paris
if
they
knew
that
the
sun
gives
light
as
soon
as
he
rises
i
allude
to
the
demand
which
i
conceive
that
the
stomach
makes
for
something
after
so
long
fasting
and
the
pernicious
custom
of
late
breakfasts
i
am
persuaded
that
it
is
advisable
to
eat
something
nearly
as
soon
as
we
rise
be
it
never
so
early
and
if
we
can
get
nothing
else
for
breakfast
and
have
not
accustomed
ourselves
to
relish
a
piece
of
good
bread
or
some
other
simple
thing
which
requires
no
labor
of
preparation
i
think
it
perfectly
proper
to
eat
a
small
quantity
of
fruit
we
come
now
to
the
particular
consideration
of
some
of
those
fruits
which
universal
experience
has
shown
to
be
the
most
salutary
of
all
these
none
is
more
wholesome
than
the
apple
there
is
indeed
a
great
diversity
in
the
quality
even
of
this
single
article
sweet
apples
are
the
most
nutritious
but
perhaps
those
which
are
gently
acid
and
at
the
same
time
mealy
are
rather
more
cooling
and
when
eaten
raw
and
in
the
heat
of
summer
not
less
wholesome
apples
which
come
to
maturity
very
early
in
the
season
appear
as
a
general
rule
to
be
less
rich
and
even
less
perfect
than
those
which
ripen
later
in
view
of
this
fact
some
writers
have
endeavored
to
dissuade
us
from
their
use
and
among
others
locke
we
may
judge
a
little
what
his
opinions
were
from
his
concluding
remarks
on
the
subject
i
never
knew
apples
hurt
anybody
says
he
after
october
but
although
neither
apples
nor
any
other
fruits
which
ripen
uncommonly
early
are
quite
so
good
as
those
which
come
in
a
little
later
yet
i
do
not
think
they
are
to
be
wholly
rejected
unless
they
have
been
raised
in
hot
houses
fruits
and
indeed
vegetables
in
general
whose
maturity
is
hastened
by
artificial
processes
must
be
less
wholesome
than
when
brought
to
perfection
in
nature
own
appropriate
time
and
manner
i
ought
to
say
however
very
distinctly
that
of
the
fruits
of
any
particular
tree
those
which
first
ripen
are
always
the
worst
for
they
are
usually
wormy
or
otherwise
defective
most
of
the
fruit
as
well
as
other
vegetables
brought
to
our
city
markets
in
this
country
is
utterly
unfit
to
be
eaten
sometimes
it
is
immature
sometimes
it
has
a
hot
house
maturity
sometimes
it
has
been
picked
so
long
that
it
has
begun
to
decay
many
fruits
berries
especially
are
in
perfection
for
a
very
short
period
only
mulberries
for
example
one
kind
especially
are
not
in
perfection
long
enough
to
carry
to
the
market
house
even
though
the
distance
were
very
small
luckily
however
very
few
mulberries
are
eaten
but
the
raspberry
and
strawberry
if
perfect
when
gathered
have
usually
begun
to
decay
before
they
are
purchased
that
this
appears
to
be
rather
unfrequent
is
because
they
are
gathered
before
they
are
ripe
dewees
regards
most
fruits
as
difficult
of
digestion
i
do
not
think
they
are
so
if
perfect
and
ripe
the
experiments
of
beaumont
so
far
as
they
prove
any
general
principle
show
conclusively
that
mellow
sweet
apples
are
more
quickly
digested
than
any
kind
of
vegetable
food
whatever
except
rice
and
sago
but
even
admitting
they
were
slow
of
digestion
i
do
not
think
as
i
have
already
shown
in
another
place
that
they
ought
on
that
account
to
be
excluded
besides
my
opinion
differs
from
that
of
in
regard
to
the
strength
of
the
digestive
powers
of
children
after
teething
they
seem
to
me
to
be
able
to
digest
any
substances
which
adults
can
and
with
as
little
difficulty
but
to
return
no
fruit
is
in
perfection
longer
than
the
apple
besides
no
fruit
appears
to
be
less
injured
in
its
nature
and
properties
by
picking
it
a
little
before
it
is
ripe
and
preserving
it
during
the
winter
it
is
on
this
account
more
perhaps
than
any
other
that
i
value
it
more
highly
than
all
other
fruits
united
apples
may
be
used
either
raw
or
cooked
in
either
case
the
skins
and
seeds
should
be
avoided
as
has
been
before
suggested
i
am
not
ignorant
that
willich
in
his
lectures
on
diet
and
regimen
an
excellent
work
in
the
main
says
that
the
seeds
ought
to
be
eaten
but
i
believe
few
physiologists
would
comply
with
his
injunction
especially
when
it
is
considered
that
he
recommends
in
the
same
connection
that
we
swallow
the
stones
of
cherries
and
plums
strange
how
far
our
theories
will
sometimes
carry
us
the
apple
is
excellent
when
roasted
or
baked
especially
the
sweet
apple
it
is
very
common
in
some
places
to
eat
baked
sweet
apples
with
milk
and
the
practice
is
by
no
means
a
bad
one
indeed
baked
or
raw
apples
might
be
advantageously
made
a
part
of
at
least
one
of
our
meals
every
day
there
is
said
to
be
a
miserly
farmer
a
single
gentleman
in
the
western
part
of
the
state
of
massachusetts
who
has
lived
on
nothing
but
apples
for
his
food
and
water
for
his
drink
about
forty
years
and
yet
he
is
said
to
enjoy
the
most
perfect
health
i
do
not
propose
this
as
an
example
worthy
of
imitation
but
it
shows
that
apples
maybe
made
to
subserve
an
important
purpose
in
diet
and
though
i
have
more
than
once
expressed
an
opinion
highly
unfavorable
to
the
exclusive
use
of
any
one
article
of
diet
yet
if
i
were
to
confine
myself
to
any
one
thing
i
know
of
nothing
except
bread
that
i
should
prefer
to
good
apples
still
however
i
prefer
a
variety
sweet
sour
early
late
and
i
should
use
them
raw
roasted
baked
made
into
sauce
with
new
or
unfermented
cider
and
boiled
good
apples
eaten
raw
with
bread
form
not
only
a
very
wholesome
but
to
an
unperverted
appetite
a
most
delicious
dinner
much
has
been
said
about
cutting
down
orchards
but
the
whole
seems
to
me
idle
for
if
the
fruit
is
of
a
good
quality
it
may
be
used
as
food
either
for
man
or
beast
and
if
not
good
the
trees
ought
either
to
be
destroyed
or
replaced
by
those
that
will
produce
fruit
which
is
better
even
if
the
object
were
to
make
it
into
cider
i
have
said
that
apples
may
be
used
both
by
man
and
beast
it
is
well
known
that
most
domestic
animals
thrive
well
on
good
apples
especially
sweet
ones
very
tolerable
molasses
is
also
sometimes
made
from
sweet
apples
nearly
everything
which
has
been
said
above
in
regard
to
apples
will
apply
to
pears
the
best
varieties
of
this
excellent
fruit
are
quite
as
nutritious
and
as
wholesome
as
the
apple
and
as
much
improved
for
the
table
by
baking
i
believe
however
that
no
cheap
process
has
yet
been
devised
for
keeping
them
as
long
in
the
winter
they
may
be
preserved
in
the
form
of
sauce
prepared
in
the
same
way
with
common
apple
sauce
the
skins
of
many
kinds
of
pears
are
less
injurious
than
those
of
apples
but
even
the
skins
of
pears
need
not
be
eaten
some
kinds
of
peaches
are
tolerably
wholesome
but
the
stringy
character
of
their
pulp
appears
to
me
to
render
them
less
so
than
apples
and
pears
though
i
am
not
confident
on
this
point
but
if
used
at
all
they
should
be
used
in
less
quantity
at
one
time
tempting
as
their
flavor
is
i
seldom
eat
them
when
i
can
get
apples
and
pears
holding
myself
in
duty
bound
to
use
the
even
of
the
fruits
fruit
says
locke
makes
one
of
the
most
difficult
chapters
in
the
government
of
health
especially
that
of
children
our
first
parents
ventured
paradise
for
it
and
it
is
no
wonder
our
children
can
not
stand
the
temptation
though
it
cost
them
their
health
the
regulation
of
this
can
not
come
under
any
one
general
rule
for
i
am
by
no
means
of
their
mind
who
would
keep
children
wholly
from
fruit
as
a
thing
totally
unwholesome
for
them
by
which
strict
way
they
make
them
but
the
more
ravenous
after
it
to
eat
good
or
bad
ripe
or
unripe
all
that
they
can
get
whenever
they
come
at
it
melons
peaches
most
sorts
of
plums
and
all
sorts
of
grapes
in
i
think
children
should
be
wholly
kept
from
as
having
a
very
tempting
taste
in
a
very
unwholesome
juice
so
that
if
it
were
possible
they
should
never
so
much
as
see
them
or
know
that
there
was
any
such
thing
but
strawberries
cherries
gooseberries
and
currants
when
thoroughly
ripe
i
think
may
be
pretty
safely
allowed
them
excellent
as
these
remarks
are
in
general
i
do
not
like
his
entire
interdiction
of
the
use
of
melons
peaches
plums
and
grapes
even
in
england
peaches
to
be
sure
as
they
come
at
a
season
when
apples
or
pears
or
both
of
them
which
are
more
wholesome
than
peaches
are
abundant
may
be
better
omitted
delicious
as
they
are
to
the
taste
and
i
do
not
think
very
highly
of
plums
but
melons
in
very
moderate
quantity
and
grapes
if
we
eat
nothing
but
the
ripe
pulp
rejecting
both
the
husk
and
the
interior
hard
part
including
the
seeds
are
i
think
useful
and
wholesome
on
the
other
hand
i
should
never
place
cherries
and
gooseberries
in
the
same
list
with
strawberries
for
the
latter
are
if
i
may
use
the
expression
infinitely
the
most
wholesome
many
seem
to
think
that
not
to
eat
all
sorts
of
fruits
is
to
despise
or
at
least
to
treat
with
neglect
the
gifts
of
god
intended
for
our
reception
by
which
they
mean
if
they
mean
anything
that
the
use
of
all
sorts
of
fruits
is
already
found
out
even
in
the
present
comparative
infancy
of
the
world
now
i
do
not
suppose
that
god
has
made
anything
in
vain
absolutely
so
though
i
do
not
think
we
have
found
out
the
true
uses
of
half
the
things
which
he
has
made
and
given
us
and
among
those
things
of
which
we
are
yet
ignorant
are
some
of
the
fruits
i
do
not
believe
it
follows
necessarily
that
because
fruits
are
created
we
are
obliged
to
use
them
all
besides
if
this
is
a
rule
it
is
one
which
nobody
follows
every
one
uses
more
of
some
sorts
and
fewer
of
others
and
a
large
proportion
of
the
community
entirely
reject
some
kinds
now
if
the
statement
commonly
made
that
all
fruits
are
the
gifts
of
god
and
ought
therefore
to
be
used
by
all
persons
is
correct
those
who
make
the
statement
ought
to
conform
to
it
as
a
rule
of
their
lives
and
to
eat
all
kinds
of
fruit
which
the
season
and
country
affords
and
not
only
eat
all
kinds
but
see
that
the
whole
of
every
kind
is
consumed
since
to
waste
any
portion
is
to
slight
the
good
gifts
of
god
the
result
then
is
that
we
can
not
obey
such
a
rule
but
are
driven
back
to
the
mode
which
common
sense
dictates
which
is
to
make
a
selection
using
some
and
rejecting
others
and
the
value
of
studying
the
nature
of
these
fruits
by
examining
the
experience
of
mankind
in
regard
to
them
consists
in
the
aid
thus
afforded
us
in
making
our
selection
wisely
there
is
one
very
common
error
in
the
use
of
the
smaller
summer
fruits
such
as
strawberries
whortleberries
currants
which
is
that
of
mixing
cream
wine
spices
sugar
with
them
we
are
thus
tempted
to
eat
too
great
a
quantity
at
once
besides
which
is
a
worse
evil
we
change
the
proportions
of
the
saccharine
parts
and
thus
do
all
in
our
power
by
increasing
a
similarity
in
all
fruits
to
destroy
that
agreeable
variety
which
god
has
established
and
which
is
probably
salutary
sec
by
confectionary
we
here
mean
the
substances
usually
sold
at
those
shops
in
our
cities
distinguished
by
the
general
name
of
confectionaries
and
which
consist
either
wholly
of
sugar
or
of
sugar
and
some
other
substances
combined
as
to
the
use
of
a
moderate
quantity
of
pure
sugar
at
our
meals
whether
it
is
procured
at
a
confectioner
shop
or
elsewhere
i
do
not
know
that
there
is
any
strong
objection
to
it
though
i
believe
that
it
can
not
be
regarded
as
indispensable
to
health
for
were
that
the
fact
it
seems
to
me
to
imply
something
short
of
infinite
wisdom
in
the
creation
of
articles
destined
for
our
sustenance
but
i
have
spoken
on
this
subject
elsewhere
a
part
however
of
the
contents
of
the
confectionary
shop
are
actually
poisonous
i
refer
to
those
things
which
are
either
frosted
as
it
is
called
or
colored
the
substances
applied
to
the
sugar
for
this
purpose
are
usually
some
mineral
or
vegetable
poison
although
the
fact
of
its
being
a
poison
may
not
always
be
known
to
the
manufacturer
the
most
unhappy
consequences
have
occasionally
followed
the
use
of
confectionary
when
poisoned
in
this
manner
a
family
of
four
persons
in
new
york
were
made
sick
in
this
way
in
march
of
year
before
last
and
some
of
them
came
very
near
losing
their
lives
the
frosting
which
caused
the
mischief
was
pronounced
by
eminent
chemists
to
be
one
fifth
rank
poison
footnote
it
is
to
be
remembered
that
those
who
eat
confectionary
so
slightly
poisoned
that
it
does
not
make
them
sick
at
once
may
nevertheless
be
as
much
injured
in
their
constitutions
as
they
who
are
poisoned
outright
in
the
latter
case
the
poison
is
in
part
thrown
out
of
the
body
in
the
former
it
remains
in
it
much
longer
and
therefore
more
surely
though
more
slowly
accomplishes
the
work
of
destruction
the
coloring
substances
used
are
sometimes
poisonous
as
well
as
the
frosting
some
of
the
articles
sold
at
these
shops
consist
of
sugar
mixed
with
paste
others
are
called
sweetmeats
that
is
fruits
or
rinds
of
fruits
preserved
in
sugar
all
these
substances
i
believe
without
exception
are
injurious
the
great
evils
of
confectionary
yet
remain
to
be
mentioned
these
are
of
three
kinds
physical
mental
and
moral
some
of
the
evils
have
it
is
true
just
been
mentioned
but
there
is
another
evil
of
still
greater
magnitude
young
people
who
eat
confectionary
commonly
eat
it
between
meals
this
produces
mischief
in
two
ways
first
it
keeps
the
stomach
at
work
when
it
ought
to
rest
for
this
like
every
other
muscular
organ
requires
its
seasons
of
repose
secondly
it
destroys
gradually
the
appetite
so
that
when
the
regular
meal
arrives
the
accustomed
keenness
of
appetite
does
not
come
with
it
and
the
consequence
is
not
so
much
that
we
do
not
eat
enough
as
that
we
are
fastidious
and
eat
a
little
of
this
then
a
little
of
that
and
usually
select
the
worst
things
we
are
not
hungry
enough
to
make
a
meal
of
a
single
article
of
plain
food
and
this
evil
goes
on
increasing
as
long
as
we
have
access
to
the
confectionary
shop
these
statements
describe
the
case
of
thousands
of
pupils
of
both
sexes
at
our
schools
and
seminaries
the
evil
resulting
from
the
use
of
confectionary
consists
in
the
fondness
for
excitement
which
is
produced
you
will
seldom
find
a
person
who
depends
daily
and
almost
hourly
on
some
excitement
to
his
appetite
and
stomach
and
is
not
satisfied
with
plain
food
who
will
content
himself
to
without
unnatural
excitements
of
the
mind
duty
to
himself
or
to
others
will
not
move
him
he
must
have
before
him
the
hope
of
reward
or
the
fear
of
punishment
he
must
be
moved
by
emulation
or
ambition
or
some
other
questionable
or
wicked
motive
or
passion
but
the
results
to
the
young
of
using
confectionary
are
still
more
dreadful
i
do
not
here
refer
to
the
danger
of
meeting
with
bad
company
at
the
shops
themselves
or
of
going
from
these
places
of
pollution
to
the
the
or
the
brothel
though
there
is
danger
enough
even
here
but
i
allude
to
the
tendency
which
a
habit
of
not
resting
satisfied
with
plain
food
but
of
depending
on
exciting
things
has
to
make
us
dissatisfied
with
plain
moral
enjoyments
the
society
of
friends
and
the
quiet
discharge
of
our
duty
to
god
and
our
neighbor
just
in
proportion
as
we
gratify
our
propensity
for
excitement
at
the
confectioner
shop
just
in
the
same
proportion
do
we
expose
ourselves
to
the
danger
of
yielding
to
temptation
should
other
gratifications
present
themselves
the
young
of
both
sexes
who
are
in
the
use
of
confectionary
are
on
the
high
road
to
gluttony
drunkenness
or
debauchery
perhaps
to
all
three
i
do
not
say
they
will
certainly
arrive
there
for
circumstances
not
quite
miraculous
may
pluck
them
as
brands
from
the
burning
but
i
do
not
hesitate
to
say
that
such
is
the
inevitable
tendency
and
i
call
on
every
mother
and
teacher
who
reads
this
section
to
beware
of
confectionaries
and
see
if
possible
that
the
young
never
set
foot
in
them
they
are
a
road
through
which
thousands
pass
to
the
chamber
of
death
death
to
the
immortal
spirit
as
well
as
to
the
body
its
vehicle
more
might
be
added
for
this
is
an
important
subject
but
i
trust
i
have
said
enough
those
who
have
read
and
believe
what
i
have
written
if
they
remain
wholly
unaffected
and
unmoved
would
not
be
roused
to
effort
were
anything
to
be
added
sec
paris
a
distinguished
british
writer
on
diet
says
that
all
pastry
is
an
abomination
and
yet
go
where
we
will
we
find
it
often
on
the
table
hardly
any
one
whether
old
or
young
attempts
to
do
without
it
there
are
indeed
some
who
will
not
eat
or
cakes
formed
of
paste
but
yet
will
not
hesitate
to
eat
hot
bread
or
rolls
or
biscuits
made
of
wheat
flour
bolted
now
what
is
this
but
paste
if
we
could
see
the
contents
of
the
stomach
an
hour
after
the
mass
is
swallowed
we
should
find
it
to
be
paste
and
paste
and
yet
the
evil
is
increasing
everywhere
so
generally
is
this
true
that
a
person
who
refuses
to
eat
hot
bread
or
cake
or
biscuit
is
deemed
singular
he
who
ventures
to
lift
his
voice
against
it
is
deemed
an
ascetic
or
a
visionary
but
such
a
voice
must
be
raised
and
heard
too
whether
its
monitions
are
or
are
not
regarded
pastry
is
less
objectionable
however
when
used
in
the
form
of
hot
bread
than
when
butter
or
fat
is
mixed
with
it
then
it
becomes
one
of
the
most
indigestible
substances
in
the
world
besides
it
not
only
tries
the
patience
of
the
stomach
but
according
to
willich
whose
authority
ranks
high
it
tends
to
produce
diseases
of
the
skin
especially
a
disease
which
he
calls
copper
in
the
face
and
which
he
pronounces
incurable
i
know
not
whether
the
eruptions
so
common
on
the
faces
of
young
people
in
this
country
and
especially
of
young
men
are
in
every
instance
either
produced
or

i
am
very
sure
of
one
thing
that
those
who
are
in
the
use
of
pastry
and
have
eruptions
of
the
skin
of
any
kind
will
not
be
apt
to
get
well
as
long
as
they
continue
the
use
of
this
objectionable
substance
physicians
are
often
consulted
about
eruptions
on
the
face
when
they
assign
the
real
cause
which
is
undoubtedly
connected
with
the
improper
gratification
of
some
of
the
appetites
in
one
way
or
another
it
is
seldom
that
the
patient
has
enough
to
follow
his

of
temperance
or
abstinence
mothers
it
is
yours
to
prevent
this
mischief
first
by
establishing
correct
physical
habits
secondly
by
teaching
your
children

great
duty
of

sec
or

i
have
reserved
this
section
for
remarks
on
certain
articles
used
at
our
fashionable
modern
tables
of
which
i
could
not
well
find
it
convenient
to
speak
elsewhere
and
first
of
salads
and
herbs
used
in
cooking
such
as
asparagus
artichokes
spinage
plantain
cabbage
dock
lettuce
chives
several
of
these
substances
are
often
eaten
raw
in
which
state
they
are
exceedingly
indigestible
at
the
best
and
they
are
rendered
still
more
beyond
the
reach
of
the
powers
of
the
stomach
by
the
oil
or
vinegar
which
is
added
to
them
boiled
they
are
more
tolerable
especially
asparagus
in
the
midst
however
of
such
an
abundance
of
excellent
food
as
this
country
affords
it
is
most
surprising
that
anybody
should
ever
take
it
into
their
heads
to
eat
such
crude
substances
and
above
all
that
they
should
fill
children
stomachs
with
them
what
child
with
an
unperverted
appetite
would
not
prefer
a
good
ripe
apple
or
peach
or
pear
to
the
most
approved
raw
salads
and
a
good
baked
one
to
the
best
boiled
asparagus
nuts
in
general
are
probably
made
for
other
animals
rather
than
man
though
of
this
we
can
not
in
the
present
infancy
of
human
knowledge
be
quite
certain
but
if
any
of
them
were
intended
by
the
creator
for
man
it
is
the
chesnut
and
this
should
be
boiled
boiled
chesnuts
are
used
as
food
in
many
parts
of
southern
europe
and
to
a
very
considerable
extent
spices
as
they
are
sometimes
called
such
as
nutmeg
mace
pepper
pimento
cubebs
cardamoms
juniper
berries
ginger
calamus
cloves
cinnamon
caraway
coriander
fennel
parsley
dill
sage
marjoram

pennyroyal
lavender
hyssop
peppermint
are
unfit
for
the
human
stomach
above
all
in
infancy
except
as
medicines
there
are
several
other
vegetables
equally
objectionable
with
the
last
though
they
can
not
be
classed
under
the
same
head
such
are
mustard
horseradish
raw
onions
garlic
cucumbers
and
pickles
no
appetite
which
has
not
been
accustomed
to
these
substances
in
early
infancy
will
ever
require
them
not
that
they
may
not
sometimes
be
useful
in
enabling
the
stomach
at
every
age
to
get
rid
of
certain
substances
with
which
it
has
been
improperly
or
unreasonably
loaded
this
is
undoubtedly
the
fact
ardent
spirits
would
do
the
same
and
it
is
with
a
view
to
some
such
effect
generally
that
medical
writers
have
spoken
in
their
favor
some
of
them
stimulate
the
stomach
to
get
rid
of
a
load
of
fruit
others
of
a
load
of
or
food
others
again
of
too
large
a
of
food
which
is
naturally
wholesome
but
in
all
these
cases
they
should
be
considered
not
as
food
but
as
medicine
and
we
ought
to
call
them
by
their
right
name
and
if
we
withhold
the
cause
of
the
disease
there
will
be
no
need
of
the
medicine

even

merely
to

in

usually

either
to

to
gratify
a

which
is
wholly
artificial
tea
coffee
beer
cider
and
most
other
common
drinks
when
not
used
for
the
sake
of
their
coolness
are
drank
both
in
winter
and
summer
for
this
purpose
that
this
is
the
fact
we
have
the
most
abundant
and
unequivocal
evidence
i
know
that
much
is
said
of
the
demand
which
a
profuse
perspiration
creates
among
hard
laborers
in
the
summer
such
a
sudden
abstraction
of
a
large
amount
of
fluid
requires
it
is
said
a
proportional
supply
or
life
would
soon
become
extinct
yet
there
are
many
old
men
who
have
perspired
profusely
at
their
labor
all
their
days
and
yet
have
drank
nothing
at
all
except
their
tea
morning
and
evening
and
perhaps
have
eaten
for
one
or
two
of
their
meals
daily
in
summer
a
bowl
of
bread
and
milk
and
some
of
them
are
among
the
most
remarkable
instances
of
longevity
which
the
country
affords
how
the
system
acquires
a
sufficient
supply
of
moisture
to
keep
up
good
health
in
these
cases
i
do
not
pretend
to
determine
perhaps
it
is
through
the
medium
of
the
lungs
but
at
any
rate
it
can
obtain
it
without
our
drinking
for
that
sole
purpose
to
the
great
danger
of
exciting
liver
complaints
diarrhoea
dyspepsia
colds
rheumatisms
and
fevers
but
if
adults
who
perspire
freely
do
not
require
much
drink
children
certainly
do
not
and
above
all
young
children
and
if
they
do
require
any
thing
it
is
only
simple
water
the
following
remarks
of
oliver
of
hanover
are
extracted
from
mussey
late
prize
essay
on
ardent
spirits
who
has
not
observed
the
extreme
satisfaction
which
children
derive
from
quenching
their
thirst
with
pure
water
and
who
that
has
perverted
his
appetite
for
drink
by
stimulating
his
palate
with
bitter
beer
sour
cider
rum
and
water
and
other
beverages
of
human
invention
but
would
be
a
gainer
even
on
the
score
of
mere
animal
gratification
without
any
reference
to
health
if
he
could
bring
back
his
vitiated
taste
to
the
simple
relish
of
nature
children
drink
because
they
are
dry
grown
people
drink
whether
dry
or
not
because
they
have
discovered
a
way
of
making
drink
pleasant
children
drink
water
because
this
is
a
beverage
of
nature
own
brewing
which
she
has
made
for
the
purpose
of
quenching
a
natural
thirst
grown
people
drink
anything
but
water
because
this
fluid
is
intended
to
quench
only
a
natural
thirst
and
natural
thirst
is
a
thing
which
they
seldom
feel
there
is
a
great
deal
of
truth
as
well
as
of
sound
philosophy
in
these
two
paragraphs
and
little
less
of
truth
in
the
following
paragraph
from
dewees
we
have
witnessed
very
often
with
sorrow
parents
giving
to
their
young
children
wine
or
other
stimulating
liquors
nature
never
intended
anything
stronger
than
water
to
be
the
drink
for
children
this
they
enjoy
greatly
and
much
advantage
is
occasionally
experienced
from
its
use
especially
after
they
have
commenced
the
use
of
animal
food
two
things
are
to
be
observed
in
the
last
remarks
which
are
that
children
demand
drink
of
any
kind
but
seldom
and
that
even
this
occasional
demand
is
often
the
special
result
of
the
use
of
animal
food
here
comes
out
an
important
secret
it
is
the
use
of
animal
food
to
a
very
great
degree
in
adults
and
children
both
that
creates
so
much
of
that
unnatural
thirst
which
prevails
in
the
community
when
we
shall
come
to
lay
aside
animal
food
in
childhood
youth
manhood
and
age
much
that
is
now
thirst
will
be
banished
and
much
of
the
intemperance
and
other
kinds
of
sensuality
which
follow
in
its
train
it
has
been
sometimes
said
that
there
is
but
one
kind
of
drink
in
the
world
and
that
is
water
this
is
strictly
or
rather
true
for
though
many
mixtures
are
drinks
it
is
only
the
water
which
they
contain
that
answers
any
of
the
legitimate
purposes
for
which
drink
was
intended
by
the
creator
the
object
of
drink
besides
quenching
our
thirst
or
rather
it
quenches
it
is
not
to
be
digested
like
food
but
to
pass
directly
from
the
stomach
into
the
and
dilute
and
temper
the
blood
rendering
it
more
fit
to
answer
the
great
purpose
of
sustaining
life
and
health
now
there
is
nothing
that
can
do
this
but
water
alcohol
can
not
do
it
nor
can
turpentine
oil
quicksilver
melted
lead
or
any
other
liquid
tea
coffee
chocolate
small
beer
soda
water
lemonade
which
are
nearly
all
water
quench
the
thirst
very
well
it
is
true
but
not
quite
so
well
as
water
alone
would
the
narcotic
principle
of
the
first
two
the
alcoholic
principle
of
the
fourth
and
the
mucilage
nutriment
acid
and
alkali
of
the
rest
are
in
the
way
for
thirst
would
be
quenched
still
better
without
them
even
when
it
is
of
an
unnatural
kind
indeed
the
same
or
similar
remarks
may
be
made
in
regard
to
all
other
mixtures
which
are
usually
proposed
as
drinks
even
milk
and
water
molasses
and
water
in
favor
of
which
so
much
is
said
are
objectionable
as
mere
drinks
not
that
they
contain
anything
poisonous
but
they
evidently
contain
nutriment
and
even
this
except
as
a
part
or
the
whole
of
a
regular
meal
does
harm
for
it
sets
the
stomach
at
work
when
it
needs
repose
mere
drink
as
i
have
already
said
is
never
digested
but
if
the
drinks
above
mentioned
and
even
milk
and
water
are
objectionable
what
shall
we
say
of
cider
wine
and
ardent
spirits
substances
which
contain
the
latter
one
half
and
the
two
former
from
one
twentieth
to
one
fourth
alcohol
surely
nobody
will
deny
that
these
substances
ought
at
all
events
to
be
banished
from
the
nursery
and
yet
we
occasionally
find
them
there
not
only
for
the
use
of
the
mother
to
the
ruin
of
the
child
indirectly
but
also
in
some
of
their
smoother
forms
for
the
use
of
the
child
itself
i
would
not
lay
too
much
stress
on
food
and
drink
for
as
i
have
already
observed
more
than
once
the
causes
of
infantile
ill
health
and
mortality
are
numerous
still
i
must
insist
that
of
all
the
sources
of
disease
these
are
the
most
prolific
much
is
done
towards
ruining
the
health
of
children
by
the
improper
food
and
drink
of
the
mother
but
when
in
addition
to
all
this
the
children
themselves
are
early
fed
with
animal
food
and
with
stimulating
drinks
punch
coffee
tea
and
an
artificial
thirst
is
early
excited
and
rendered
habitual
their
destruction
for
time
and
eternity
is
almost
inevitable
very
few
children
relish
any
drink
but
water
or
sweetened
water
at
first
and
where
they
do
it
is
probably
hereditary
i
have
been
struck
with
their
tastes
and
preferences
nor
less
with
the
folly
of
those
around
them
in
endeavoring
to
change
them
by
requiring
them
almost
always
against
their
will
to
sip
a
little
coffee
or
a
little
tea
or
a
little
lemonade
or
it
may
be
a
little
toddy
such
children
escape
the
death
of
the
drunkard
or
the
debauchee
but
if
they
do
it
will
not
be
through
the
instrumentality
of
the
parents
i
am
very
much
opposed
to
giving
children
hot
drinks
of
any
kind
if
they
are
to
drink
substances
which
are
injurious
as
tea
or
coffee
let
them
be
cool
i
do
not
say
for
that
would
be
going
to
the
other
extreme
but
no
drink
in
any
ordinary
case
should
be
above
the
heat
of
our
bodies
that
is
about
degrees
of
fahrenheit
thermometer
yet
the
precautions
of
this
paragraph
will
be
almost
unnecessary
if
children
are
confined
as
they
ought
to
be
and
would
be
did
we
not
go
out
of
our
way
to
teach
them
otherwise
to
water
as
their
only
drink
cold
water
is
almost
always
preferred
not
one
child
in
a
thousand
would
ever
prefer
it
hot
until
his
taste
had
been
perverted
no
writer
has
inveighed
more
against
hot
drinks
of
every
kind
than
the
late
william
cobbett
and
as
i
think
with
more
justice
but
in
avoiding
one
rock
we
must
not
as
has
already
been
intimated
make
shipwreck
on
another
hot
drinks
though
they
injure
the
powers
of
the
stomach
and
by
that
means
and
through
that
medium
are
one
principal
cause
of
the
almost
universal
early
decay
of
teeth
are
yet
less
injurious
or
at
least
less
dangerous
immediately
than
cold
ones
locke
in
speaking
of
the
sports
of
a
child
in
the
open
air
has
the
following
quaint
but
judicious
remarks
playing
in
the
open
air
has
but
this
one
danger
in
it
that
i
know
and
that
is
that
when
he
is
hot
with
running
up
and
down
he
should
sit
or
lie
down
on
the
cold
or
moist
earth
this
i
grant
and
drinking
cold
drink
when
they
are
hot
with
labor
or
exercise
brings
more
people
to
the
grave
or
to
the
brink
of
it
by
fevers
and
other
diseases
than
anything
i
know
these
mischiefs
are
easily
enough
prevented
when
he
is
little
being
then
seldom
out
of
sight
and
if
during
his
childhood
he
be
constantly
and
rigorously
kept
from
sitting
on
the
ground
or
drinking
any
cold
liquor
while
he
is
hot
the
custom
of
forbearing
grown
into
will
help
much
to
preserve
him
when
he
is
no
longer
under
his
maid
or
tutor
eye
more
fevers
and
surfeits
are
got
by
people
drinking
when
they
are
hot
than
by
any
one
thing
i
know
if
he
the
child
be
very
hot
he
should
by
no
means
at
least
a
good
piece
of
bread
first
to
be
eaten
will
gain
time
to
warm
his
drink
which
then
he
may
drink
safely
if
he
be
very
dry
it
will
go
down
so
warmed
and
quench
his
thirst
better
and
if
he
will
not
drink
it
so
warmed
abstaining
will
not
hurt
him
besides
this
will
teach
him
to
forbear
which
is
a
habit
of
the
greatest
use
for
health
of
mind
and
body
too
the
last
remarks
are
full
of
wisdom
mothers
may
depend
upon
it
that
every
indulgence
to
which
they
accustom
their
children
paves
the
way
for
indulgence
and
has
a
tendency
to
lead
indirectly
to
indulgence
in
other
matters
and
on
the
contrary
every
which
they
can
lead
children
to
exercise
voluntarily
even
in
these
matters
of
food
drink
exercise
is
so
much
gained
in
the
great
work
of
and
the
resisting
of
temptation
in
matters
of
higher
importance
but
i
must
not
moralize
too
long
having
dwelt
on
this
same
point
under
the
head
confectionary
i
proceed
therefore
to
make
a
few
more
extracts
from
locke
not
being
permitted
to
without
eating
will
prevent
the
custom
of
having
the
cup
often
at
his
nose
a
dangerous
beginning
men
often
bring
habitual
hunger
and
thirst
on
themselves
by
custom
you
may
if
you
please
bring
any
one
to
be
thirsty
every
hour
i
once
lived
in
a
house
where
to
appease
a
froward
child
they
gave
him
as
often
as
he
cried
so
that
he
was
constantly
bibbing
and
though
he
could
not
speak
yet
he
drank
more
in
hours
than
i
did
it
is
convenient
for
health
and
sobriety
to
drink
no
more
than
natural
thirst
requires
and
he
that
eats
not
salt
meats
nor
drinks
strong
drink
will
seldom
thirst
between
meals
great
mischief
is
often
done
to
their
health
by
children
at
school
and
one
instance
of
this
is
in
getting
violently
heated
with
exercise
and
then
pouring
down
large
quantities
of
cold
water
to
cool
themselves
i
once
made
it
a
habitual
rule
for
pupils
that
they
must
drink
water
if
they
drank
it
at
all
on
leaving
their
seats

my

allow
of
only
a
few
remarks
and
those
must
be
general
that
an
ounce
of
prevention
is
worth
a

of

has
so
long
ago
become
a
proverb
that
it
seems
almost
idle
to
repeat
the
sentiment
and
yet
it
is
to
be
feared
that
very
few
receive
it
as
a
practical
truth
in
the
management
of

now
nothing
is

certain
than
that
it
is
easier
as

have
elsewhere
mentioned
the
opinion
of
a
very
eminent
physician
that
nine
in
ten
of
children
diseases
may
be
imputed
to
error
with
regard
to
the
quantity
or
the
quality
of
their
food
for
myself
i
am
by
no
means
certain
that
nine
out
of
ten
is
the
exact
proportion
though
i
think
the
number
is
at
all
events
very
large
few
children
or
even
grown
persons
are
seized
with
disease
suddenly
their
progress
towards
it
is
always
gradual
and
sometimes
imperceptible
to
a
physician
of
any
tolerable
degree
of
skill
however
there
is
no
difficulty
in
observing
and
pointing
out
the
first
steps
towards
illness
in
those
whose
habits
of
life
are
well
known
to
him
and
of
foretelling
the
consequence
but
since
parents
and
nurses
are
not
so
well
qualified
as
physicians
to
make
these
observations
i
will
endeavor
to
point
out
a
few
certain
signs
and
symptoms
by
which
they

a

would
have

there
is
much
of
truth
in
these
remarks
but
if
they
are
wholly
true
then
very

perfectly
healthy

no

that
eats
much

food

whether
it

the
character

makes
the

not
it
is
also
true
that
there
is
nearly

much
difference
of

between
who
use

those
who
do
not

this
rule
is
the
more
important
because
if
duly
persevered
in
it
will
generally
prevent
disease
and
save
the
trouble
and
evil
consequences
of
taking
medicine
at
all
meanwhile
it
will
be
advisable
to
call
in
a
physician
not
to
give
drugs
but
to
prevent
the
necessity
of
giving
them
there
is
a
foolish
fear
abroad
that
physicians
if
called
before
a
person
is
violently
sick
will
dose
him
with
their
drugs
as
a
matter
of
course
till
they
him
sick
but
this
no
judicious
physician
will
ever
do
it
may
done
though
i
believe
it
has
been
seldom
the
more
general
course
is
to
defer
calling
for
medical
advice
till
it
is
too
late
to
use
preventive
means
and
medicine
is
then
resorted
to
by
the
physician
as
a
sort
of
necessary
evil
a
judicious
physician
seasonably
called
in
would
in
many
instances
save
a
severe
fit
of
sickness
besides
a
great
deal
of
expense
both
of
time
and
money
but
if
the
first
symptoms
of
approaching
disease
are
overlooked
if
the
child
is
fed
or
rather
crammed
with
solid
food
as
much
as
ever
and
if
no
medical
advice
is
sought
his
sleep
will
soon
become
disturbed
he
will
be
talking
starting
and
tumbling
about
and
will
have
frightful
dreams
or
he
will
at
other
times
be
found
smiling
and
laughing

these
in
the
end
may
be
added
loss
of
appetite
paleness
emaciation
weakness
cough
and
consumption
or
colics
worms
and

i
do
not
undertake
to
say
that
the
most
judicious
parental
management
aided
by
the
greatest
medical
skill
will
always
prevent
disease
far
from
it
the
child
may
and
undoubtedly
sometimes
does
inherit
a
tendency
to
a
particular
disease
or
he
may
be
made
sick
by
error
in

to
dress

so
long
as
nine

of
the

this

may

under
the
following
heads
rocking
in
the
cradle
carrying
in
the
arms
creeping
walking
riding
in
a
carriage
and
riding
on
horseback
these
i
shall
consider
in
their
order
sec
in
the
there
are
two
opinions
in
regard
to
the
use
of
the
cradle
in
the
nursery
some
condemn
it
altogether
others
think
its
occasional
use
highly
proper
those
who
condemn
it
do
it
chiefly
on
the
ground
that
it
produces
a
whirling
motion
of
the
brain
which
while
it
inclines
to
giddiness
and
lulls
to
sleep
disturbs
in
some
degree
the
process
of
digestion
it
seems
to
me
that
there
is
weight
to
this
objection
and
although
the
cradle
has
been
extensively
used
without
producing
any
obviously
evil
effects
i
should
greatly
prefer
to
have
it
universally
laid
aside
as
far
as
mere
amusement
is
demanded
it
is
quite
unnecessary
since
there
are
so
many
amusements
which
are
far
better
as
a
means
of
inducing
sleep
i
am
still
more
strongly
opposed
to
it
for
if
a
child
be
rationally
treated
in
every
other
respect
it
will
never
need
artificial
means
to
induce
it
to
sleep
nature
will
then
be
the
most
appropriate
directress
in
this
matter
if
there
is
a
cradle
in
a
nursery
it
is
almost
always
full
of
clothes
loaded
with
air
more
or
less
impure
and
the
child
is
buried
in
it
more
than
is
compatible
with
health
even
in
the
judgment
of
the
mother
or
the
nurse
for
so
convenient
is
its
use
and
so
great
the
temptation
to
keep
the
child
in
it
that
he
will
often
be
found
soaking
there
a
large
proportion
of
his
time
every
one
knows
that
the
air
has
not
so
free
access
to
a
child
in
the
cradle
as
elsewhere
especially
if
it
have
a
kind
of
covering
or
hood
to
it
as
we
often
see
besides
the
cradle
is
a
piece
of
furniture
which
takes
up
a
great
deal
of
space
in
the
nursery
and
every
one
who
has
made
the
trial
effectually
will
it
seems
to
me
greatly
prefer
its
room
to
its
company
if
any
cradle
is
to
be
used
those
are
best
which
are
suspended
by
cords
and
are
swung
rather
than
rocked
and
this
swinging
should
be
in
a
line
with
the
body
of
the
child
as
much
as
possible
as
this
motion
is
less
likely
to
produce
injury
than
its
opposite
sec
in
the
this
is
the
most
appropriate
exercise
for
the
first
two
months
of
existence
and
indeed
one
of
the
best
for
some
time
afterward
although
a
healthy
thriving
child
ought
to
sleep
for
some
time
after
birth
from
two
thirds
to
three
fourths
of
his
time
yet
it
should
never
be
forgotten
that
the
demand
for
proper
exercise
during
the
rest
of
the
time
is
not
the
less
imperious
on
this
account
but
probably
the
more
so
i
have
already
mentioned
the
importance
of
bathing
which
is
one
form
of
exercise
and
of
gentle
motion
in
the
arms
immediately
afterward
the
same
gentle
motion
should
be
often
repeated
during
the
day
care
being
taken
to
hold
the
child
in
such
a
position
as
will
be
easy
to
him
and
favorable
to
the
free
exercise
of
all
his
limbs
and
muscles
there
are
many
mothers
and
nurses
who
not
only
rejoice
that
the
infant
inclines
to
sleep
a
great
deal
since
it
gives
them
more
liberty
but
who
take
pains
to
prolong
these
hours
beyond
what
nature
requires
by
artificial
means
i
refer
not
only
to
the
use
of
the
cradle
but
to
means
still
more
artificial
the
use
of
cordials
and
opiates
to
which
i
have
already
adverted
but
whatever
the
means
used
may
be
they
defeat
the
purposes
of
nature
and
are
in
the
highest
degree
reprehensible
nothing
but
the
most
chilling
poverty
should
prevent
the
mother
from
having
the
child
for
a
few
weeks
of
its
first
existence
at
least
in
her
own
arms
nearly
all
the
time
which
is
not
absolutely
demanded
for
repose
she
should
even
invite
it
to
wakefulness
rather
than
encourage
sleep
attention
to
exercise
ought
to
be
commenced
before
the
child
is
more
than
ten
days
old
for
this
purpose
he
should
be
placed
on
his
back
on
a
pillow
in
order
that
the
body
may
rest
at
as
many
points
as
possible
in
this
position
he
has
the
opportunity
to
move
his
limbs
with
the
most
perfect
freedom
and
to
exercise
his
numerous
muscles
there
is
nothing
more
important
to
the
infant
not
even
sleep
itself
than
the
action
of
all
his
muscles
and
nothing
contributes
more
to
his
rapid
growth
at
first
the
body
should
be
kept
while
on
the
arm
in
nearly
a
horizontal
position
with
the
head
perhaps
a
very
little
elevated
but
after
a
few
weeks
it
will
be
proper
to
change
the
position
for
a
small
part
of
the
time
placing
the
body
so
that
it
may
form
an
angle
of
a
few
degrees
with
the
horizon
when
this
is
done
however
it
should
always
be
by
placing
the
hand
against
the
shoulders
and
head
in
such
a
manner
as
to
support
well
the
back
for
it
is
extremely
injurious
to
suffer
the
feeble
spine
to
sustain
at
this
early
period
any
considerable
weight
still
more
erroneous
is
the
practice
of
some
careless
nurses
of
carrying
the
child
quite
upright
a
part
of
the
time
almost
without
any
support
at
all
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
spinal
column
of
many
a
child
is
injured
for
life
in
this
way
there
can
be
no
apology
for
such
things
but
it
is
not
sufficient
to
denounce
merely
the
custom
of
holding
the
infant
body
in
an
erect
position
every
inquiring
mother
and
it
is
for
such
and
no
other
that
i
write
will
naturally
and
properly
ask
the
reason
why
the
child
is
not
born
with
all
its
bones
solid
some
are
mere
cartilage
for
a
considerable
time
this
is
the
case
with
the
bones
of
the
back
now
every
person
must
see
that
the
weight
of
the
child
head
and
shoulders
resting
for
a
considerable
time
on
the
slender
cartilaginous
spinal
column
may
easily
bend
it
and
a
curvature
thus
given
may
and
often
does
deform
children
for
life
dewees
mentions
a
nurse
who
from
a
foolish
fondness
for
displaying
them
made
the
children
consigned
to
her
charge
sit
perfectly
upright
before
they
were
a
month
old
it
is
truly
ludicrous
he
says
to
see
the
little
creatures
sitting
as
straight
as
if
they
were
stiffened
by
a
back
board
it
is
truly
i
should
say
rather
than
ludicrous
crooked
spines
must
be
the
inevitable
consequence
if
nothing
worse
the
practice
of
bracing
children
as
it
is
called
by
straps
back
boards
corsets
where
it
has
produced
any
effect
at
all
has
always
had
a
tendency
to
crook
the
spine
this
may
be
seen
first
by
observing
one
shoulder
to
be
lower
than
the
other
and
next
by
a
projection
of
the
part
of
the
shoulder
blades
next
to
the
spine
whenever
these
changes
begin
to
appear
it
is
time
to
send
for
a
physician
though
it
may
often
be
too
late
to
effect
a
cure
but
on
the
general
subject
of
bracing
and
corseting
i
have
treated
at
sufficient
length
elsewhere
there
is
another
error
committed
in
carrying
children
in
the
arms
the
head
of
the
infant
is
often
permitted
either
to
hang
constantly
on
one
side
or
to
roll
about
loosely
as
if
it
hardly
belonged
to
the
body
in
the
former
case
there
is
danger
of
producing
a
habit
of
holding
the
head
upon
one
side
which
it
will
be
very
difficult
to
overcome
in
the
latter
the
spinal
marrow
itself
may
be
injured
which
would
produce
alarming
and
perhaps
fatal
consequences
but
all
these
evils
as
has
already
been
said
may
be
prevented
if
the
hand
is
placed
so
as
to
support
the
head
and
shoulders
let
not
the
mother
however
who
reads
this
work
trust
the
matter
wholly
to
a
nurse
she
must
see
to
it
herself
else
she
incurs
a
most
fearful
responsibility
the
suggestions
i
have
made
are
the
more
important
in
the
case
of
children
either
very
fleshy
or
very
feeble
and
of
those
disposed
to
rickets
or
scrofula
but
they
are
important
to
all
i
have
said
that
the
motion
of
the
child
on
the
arm
should
be
gentle
many
are
in
the
habit
of
tossing
infants
about
there
can
be
no
objection
to
a
slight
and
slow
movement
up
and
down
for
a
minute
or
so
at
a
time
indeed
it
is
rather
to
be
recommended
as
likely
to
give
strength
and
vigor
no
less
than
pleasure
to
the
child
but
when
such
movements
are
carried
to
excess
so
as
to
frighten
the
child
they
are
highly
reprehensible
the
shock
thus
produced
to
the
nervous
system
has
sometimes
been
so
great
as
to
produce
sudden
death
nor
is
it
safe
to
run
jump
or
descend
stairs
hastily
or
violently
with
a
child
in
our
arms
and
for
similar
reasons
infants
should
not
be
carried
always
on
the
same
arm
for
there
is
danger
of
contracting
a
habit
of
leaning
to
one
side
and
thus
of
becoming
crooked
on
this
account
the
arm
on
which
they
rest
should
be
often
changed
nor
should
they
be
grasped
too
firmly
a
skilful
mother
will
hold
a
child
quite
loosely
with
the
most
perfect
safety
while
an
inexperienced
one
will
grasp
him
so
hard
as
to
expose
the
soft
bones
to
be
bent
out
of
their
place
and
yet
be
quite
as
liable
to
let
him
fall
as
she
who
handles
him
with
more
ease
and
freedom
sec
mankind
must
creep
before
they
can
walk
is
an
old
adage
often
used
to
remind
us
of
that
patient
application
which
is
so
indispensable
to
secure
any
highly
important
or
valuable
end
but
it
is
as
true
literally
as
it
is
figuratively
the
act
of
creeping
exercises
in
a
remarkable
degree
nearly
all
the
muscles
of
the
body
and
this
too
without
much
fatigue
some
mothers
there
indeed
are
who
think
it
a
happy
circumstance
if
a
child
can
be
taught
to
walk
without
this
intermediate
step
but
such
mothers
must
have
strange
ideas
of
the
animal
economy
they
must
never
have
thought
of
the
pleasure
which
creeping
affords
the
mind
or
of
the
vigor
it
imparts
to
the
body
children
are
wonderfully
pleased
with
their
own
voluntary
efforts
what
they
can
do
themselves
yields
them
greater
pleasure
than
if
done
by
the
mother
or
the
nurse
yet
the
latter
are
exceedingly
prone
to
forget
or
overlook
all
this
and
to
say
at
least
practically
that
the
only
proper
efforts
are
those
to
which
themselves
give
direction
they
are
moreover
exceedingly
fond
of
display
some
mothers
seem
to
act
in
all
they
do
with
and
for
children
as
if
all
the
latter
were
good
for
was
display
and
amusement
they
feed
them
indeed
and
strive
to
prolong
their
existence
but
it
appears
to
be
for
similar
reasons
to
those
which
would
lead
them
to
take
kind
care
of
a
pet
lamb
it
is
on
this
account
that
they
dress
them
out
in
the
manner
they
do
strive
to
make
them
sit
up
straight
and
prohibit
their
creeping
it
is
on
this
account
too
as
much
perhaps
as
any
other
that
and
leading
strings
are
put
in
such
early
requisition
the
contrary
would
be
far
the
safer
extreme
and
the
parent
who
keeps
his
child
scrambling
about
upon
the
back
as
long
as
possible
and
when
he
can
not
prevent
longer
an
inversion
of
this
position
retains
him
at
creeping
as
long
as
is
in
his
power
is
as
much
wiser
in
comparison
with
him
who
urges
him
forward
to
make
a
prodigy
of
him
as
he
is
who
instead
of
making
his
child
a
prodigy
in
mind
or
morals
at
premature
age
holds
him
back
and
endeavors
to
have
his
mental
and
moral
nature
developed
no
faster
than
his
physical
frame
i
wish
young
mothers
would
settle
it
in
their
minds
at
once
that
the
longer
their
children
creep
the
better
they
need
have
no
fears
that
the
force
of
habit
will
retain
them
on
their
knees
after
nature
has
given
them
strength
to
rise
and
walk
for
their
incessant
activity
and
incontrollable
restlessness
will
be
sure
to
rouse
them
as
early
as
it
ought
least
of
all
ought
the
difficulty
of
keeping
them
clean
to
move
them
from
the
path
of
duty
children
who
are
allowed
to
crawl
will
soon
be
anxious
to
do
more
we
shall
presently
see
them
taking
hold
of
a
chair
or
a
table
and
endeavoring
to
raise
themselves
up
by
it
if
they
fail
in
a
dozen
attempts
they
do
not
give
up
the
point
but
persevere
till
their
efforts
are
crowned
with
success
having
succeeded
in
raising
themselves
from
the
floor
they
soon
learn
to
stand
by
holding
to
the
object
by
which
they
have
raised
themselves
soon
they
acquire
the
art
of
standing
without
holding
footnote
the
art
of
standing
which
consists
in
balancing
one
self
by
means
of
the
muscles
of
the
body
and
lower
limb
simple
as
it
may
seem
to
those
who
have
never
reflected
on
the
subject
is
really
an
important
acquisition
for
a
child
of
twelve
or
fifteen
months
no
wonder
they
feel
a
conscious
pride
when
they
find
themselves
able
to
stand
erect
like
the
world
around
them
ere
long
they
venture
to
put
forward
one
foot
they
then
repeat
the
effort
and
walk
a
little
holding
at
the
same
time
by
a
chair
and
lastly
they
acquire
with
joy
to
them
inexpressible
and
to
us
inconceivable
the
art
of
trudging
alone
when
children
learn
to
walk
in
nature
own
way
it
is
seldom
indeed
that
we
find
them
with
curved
legs
or
crooked
or
clubbed
feet
these
deformities
are
almost
universally
owing
either
to
the
mother
or
the
nurse
let
me
be
distinctly
understood
as
utterly
opposed
not
only
to
leading
strings
and
every
other
contrivance
to
induce
children
to
walk
before
their
legs
are
fit
for
it
but
to
efforts
of
every
kind
whose
main
object
is
the
same
teaching
them
to
walk
by
taking
hold
of
one
of
their
hands
is
in
some
respects
quite
as
bad
as
any
other
mode
for
if
the
child
should
fall
while
we
have
hold
of
his
hand
there
is
some
danger
of
dislocating
or
otherwise
injuring
the
limb
falls
we
must
expect
but
if
a
child
is
left
to
his
own
voluntary
efforts
as
much
as
possible
these
falls
will
be
fewer
and
probably
less
serious
than
under
any
other
circumstances
sec
the
way
to
learn
how
to
write
without
ruled
lines
is
was
the
frequent
saying
of
an
old
schoolmaster
whom
i
once
knew
and
i
may
say
with
as
much
confidence
and
with
more
truth
that
the
way
for
a
child
to
learn
to
walk
alone
is
to
hold
by
things
i
have
anticipated
in
previous
pages
much
of
what
might
have
otherwise
been
contained
in
this
section
a
few
additional
remarks
are
all
that
will
be
necessary
at
first
the
nursery
will
be
quite
large
enough
for
our
young
pedestrian
much
time
should
elapse
before
he
is
permitted
to
go
abroad
upon
the
green
grass
not
lest
the
air
should
reach
him
or
the
sun
shine
upon
his
face
and
hands
but
because
the
surface
of
the
ground
is
so
much
less
firm
and
regular
than
the
floor
that
he
ought
to
be
quite
familiar
with
walking
on
the
latter
in
the
first
place
but
when
he
can
walk
well
in
the
play
ground
garden
fields
and
roads
it
is
highly
desirable
that
he
should
go
out
more
or
less
every
day
when
the
weather
will
possibly
admit
nor
would
i
be
so
fearful
as
many
are
of
a
drop
of
rain
or
dew
or
a
breath
of
wind
for
say
what
they
will
in
favor
of
riding
sailing
and
other
modes
of
exercise
there
is
none
equal
to
walking
as
soon
as
a
child
is
able
none
so
natural
none
in
ordinary
cases
so
salutary
i
know
it
is
unpopular
and
therefore
our
young
master
or
young
miss
must
be
hoisted
into
a
carriage
or
upon
the
back
of
a
horse
to
the
manifest
danger
of
health
or
limbs
or
both
who
of
us
ever
knew
a
herdsman
or
a
shepherd
who
found
it
for
the
health
and
of
the
young
calf
or
lamb
to
hoist
it
into
a
carriage
and
carry
it
through
the
streets
instead
of
suffering
it
to
walk
such
a
thing
would
excite
astonishment
and
the
man
who
should
do
it
would
be
deemed
insane
the
health
and
growth
of
our
young
domestic
animals
is
best
promoted
by
suffering
them
to
walk
run
and
skip
in
their
own
way
they
ask
no
artificial
legs
or
horses
or
carriages
but
would
it
not
be
difficult
to
find
arguments
in
favor
of
carrying
children
about
when
they
are
able
to
walk
which
would
not
be
equally
strong
in
favor
of
carrying
about
lambs
and
calves
and
pigs
this
is
the
more
remarkable
from
the
consideration
elsewhere
urged
that
in
general
we
take
more
rational
pains
about
the
physical
of
domestic
animals
than
of
children
however
it
will
be
seen
on
a
little
reflection
that
the
number
of
those
who
carry
children
about
is
after
all
very
inconsiderable
the
greater
portion
of
the
community
regard
it
as
too
troublesome
or
costly
and
if
poverty
brought
with
it
no
other
evils
than
a
permit
to
children
to
walk
on
the
legs
which
the
creator
gave
them
it
could
hardly
be
deemed
a
misfortune
it
is
scarcely
necessary
to
add
that
there
will
be
nothing
gained
to
the
young
or
to
persons
of
any
age
from
walks
which
are
very
long
and
fatiguing
walking
should
refresh
and
invigorate
when
it
is
carried
beyond
this
especially
with
the
young
child
we
have
passed
the
line
of
safety
sec
in
it
will
be
seen
by
the
foregoing
section
that
i
am
not
very
friendly
to
the
use
of
carriages
for
the
young
after
they
can
walk
before
this
period
however
i
think
they
may
be
often
serviceable
and
there
are
occasional
instances
which
may
render
them
useful
afterward
on
this
account
i
have
thought
it
might
be
well
to
give
the
following
general
directions
carriages
for
children
should
be
so
constructed
as
not
to
be
liable
to
overset
to
this
end
the
wheels
must
be
low
and
the
axle
unusually
extended
the
body
should
be
long
enough
to
allow
the
child
to
lie
down
when
necessary
and
so
deep
that
he
may
not
be
likely
to
fall
out
everything
should
be
made
secure
and
firm
to
avoid
if
possible
the
danger
of
accidents
the
carriage
should
be
drawn
steadily
and
slowly
not
violently
or
with
a
jerking
motion
such
a
place
should
be
selected
as
will
secure
the
child
if
necessary
from
the
full
blaze
of
a
hot
sun
this
point
might
indeed
be
secured
by
having
the
carriage
covered
but
i
am
opposed
to
covered
carriages
for
children
or
adults
unless
we
are
compelled
to
ride
in
the
rain
while
the
child
is
unable
to
sit
up
without
injury
and
even
for
some
months
afterwards
he
ought
by
all
means
to
lie
down
in
a
carriage
because
it
requires
more
strength
to
sit
in
a
seat
which
is
moving
than
in
a
place
where
he
is
stationary
in
assuming
the
horizontal
position
in
a
carriage
a
pillow
is
needed
and
such
other
arrangements
as
will
prevent
too
much
rolling
after
the
child
strength
will
fairly
permit
he
may
sit
up
in
the
carriage
but
he
ought
still
to
be
secured
against
too
much
motion
as
his
strength
increases
however
the
latter
direction
will
be
less
and
less
necessary
i
need
not
repeat
in
this
place
had
i
not
witnessed
so
many
accidents
from
neglect
the
caution
recently
given
that
great
care
should
be
taken
to
prevent
the
child
from
falling
out
of
the
carriage
while
children
are
riding
abroad
in
cold
weather
much
pains
should
be
taken
to
see
that
they
are
suitably
clothed
it
is
well
to
keep
them
in
motion
while
they
are
in
the
carriage
and
especially
to
guard
against
their
falling
asleep
in
the
open
air
until
they
have
become
very
much
accustomed
to
being
out
in
it
it
has
been
said
by
some
writers
that
a
ride
ought
never
to
exceed
the
length
of
half
an
hour
but
no
positive
rule
can
be
given
except
to
avoid
sec
on
while
children
are
very
young
i
think
it
both
improper
and
unsafe
to
take
them
abroad
on
horseback
i
mean
so
long
as
they
are
in
health
in
case
of
disease
this
mode
of
exercise
is
sometimes
one
of
the
most
salutary
in
the
world
but
after
boys
are
six
or
seven
years
old
and
girls
ten
if
they
are
ever
to
practise
horsemanship
it
is
time
for
them
to
begin
both
because
they
are
less
apt
to
be
unreasonably
timid
at
this
age
and
because
they
learn
much
more
rapidly
so
few
parents
are
good
horsemen
that
if
there
is
a
riding
school
at
hand
i
should
prefer
placing
a
child
in
it
at
once
but
i
wish
to
be
distinctly
understood
that
i
do
not
consider
it
a
matter
of
importance
especially
to
females
that
they
should
ever
learn
to
ride
at
all
some
of
the
principal
objections
to
riding
on
horseback
by
boys
as
an
ordinary
exercise
are
the
following
walking
as
i
have
already
intimated
is
one
of
the
most
healthy
modes
of
exercise
in
the
world
it
is
nature
exercise
and
was
unquestionably
in
exclusive
use
long
before
universal
dominion
was
given
to
man
if
not
for
many
centuries
afterward
and
i
believe
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
prove
that
it
interfered
at
all
with
human
longevity
for
the
first
of
our
race
lived
almost
a
thousand
years
young
children
in
riding
on
horseback
are
rather
apt
to
acquire
rapidly
the
habit
of
domineering
over
animals
it
seems
almost
needless
to
say
how
easy
the
transition
is
in
such
cases
should
opportunity
offer
from
tyranny
over
the
brute
slave
to
tyranny
over
the
human
being
there
are
in
the
family
and
in
the
school
as
well
as
elsewhere
it
is
the
spirit
of
a
person
which
makes
him
either
a
tyrant
or
and
let
us
beware
how
we
foster
this
spirit
in
the
children
whom
god
has
given
us
chapter
xi
amusements
universal
need
of
amusements
why
so
necessary
error
of
schools
error
of
families
infant
schools
as
often
conducted
particularly
injurious
lessons
or
tasks
should
be
short
mistakes
of
some
manual
labor

of

amusements
in
the

with

and

dissected

however
heterodox
the
concession
may
be
i
am
one
of
those
who
believe
amusements
of
some
sort
or
other
to
be
universally
necessary
indeed
i
can
not
possibly
conceive
of
an
individual
in
health
whatever
may
be
the
age
sex
condition
or
employment
who
does
not
need
them
in
a
greater
or
less
degree
now
if
by
the
term
amusement
i
merely
meant
employment
nobody
would
probably
differ
from
me
at
least
in
theory
every
one
is
ready
to
admit
the
importance
of
being
constantly
employed
a
mind
unemployed
is
a
vacant
mind
and
a
vacant
or
idle
mind
is
the
devil
so
says
the
proverb
by
amusement
however
i
mean
something
more
than
mere
employment
for
the
more
constantly
an
adult
individual
is
employed
the
greater
generally
is
his
demand
for
amusement
indolent
persons
have
less
need
of
being
amused
than
others
but
perhaps
there
are
few
if
any
persons
to
be
found
who
are
so
indolent
as
not
to
think
continually
on
one
subject
or
another
and
it
is
this
constant
thinking
more
than
anything
else
that
creates
the
necessity
of
which
i
am
speaking
the
mere
drudge
whether
biped
or
quadruped
he
i
mean
whose
thinking
powers
are
scarcely
alive
has
little
need
of
the
relief
which
is
afforded
by
amusement
the
young
of
all
animals
man
among
the
rest
appear
to
have
such
an
instinctive
fondness
for
amusement
that
so
long
as
they
are
unrestrained
they
seldom
need
any
urging
on
this
point
in
regard
to
the
case
is
somewhat
different
in
this
respect
most
children
require
attention
and
restraint
and
some
of
them
a
great
deal
of
it
but
what
is
the
nature
of
the
amusement
which
adults
nay
mankind
generally
require
i
answer
it
is
relief
from
the
employment
of
thinking
for
it
is
not
that
mankind
do
not
really
think
at
all
that
moralists
complain
so
loudly
when
they
tell
us
that
men
will
not
think
they
mean
that
they
will
not
think
as
rational
beings
they
think
indeed
and
so
do
the
ox
and
the
horse
and
the
dog
and
the
elephant
but
not
as
rational
men
ought
to
do
and
this
it
is
that
constitutes
the
burden
of
complaint
but
you
will
probably
find
few
persons
belonging
to
the
human
species
who
do
not
think
constantly
at
least
while
awake
and
whose
mental
powers
do
not
become
fatigued
and
demand
relief
in
amusement
children
minds
are
so
soon
wearied
by
a
continuous
train
of
thinking
even
on
topics
which
are
pleasing
to
them
that
they
can
seldom
he
brought
to
give
their
attention
to
a
single
subject
long
at
once
they
require
almost
incessant
change
both
for
the
sake
of
relief
and
to
amuse
for
the
of
amusement
and
it
is
to
my
own
mind
one
of
the
most
striking
proofs
of
infinite
wisdom
in
the
creation
of
the
human
mind
that
it
has
during
infancy
such
an
irresistible
tendency
to
amusement
how
greatly
do
they
err
who
grudge
children
especially
very
young
children
the
time
which
in
obedience
to
the
dictates
of
their
nature
they
are
so
fond
of
spending
in
sports
and
gambols
how
much
more
rational
would
it
be
to
encourage
and
direct
them
in
their
amusements
and
how
exceedingly
unwise
is
the
practice
whenever
and
wherever
it
exists
of
confining
them
to
school
rooms
and
benches
not
only
for
hours
but
for
whole
half
days
at
once
if
individuals
and
circumstances
were
everywhere
combined
with
the
special
purpose
to
oppose
the
intentions
of
nature
respecting
the
human
being
at
every
step
of
his
progress
from
the
cradle
to
maturity
and
from
maturity
to
the
grave
i
hardly
know
how
they
could
contrive
to
accomplish
such
a
purpose
more
effectually
than
it
is
at
present
accomplished
but
it
is
proper
that
i
should
here
explain
a
little
all
our
family
arrangements
tend
to
repress
amusement
everything
is
contrived
to
facilitate
business
especially
the
business
or
employments
of
adults
the
child
is
hardly
regarded
as
a
human
being
certainly
not
as
a
being
he
is
considered
as
a
mere
fragment
or
to
change
the
figure
as
a
plant
too
young
to
be
of
any
real
service
to
mankind
because
too
young
to
bear
any
of
its
appropriate
fruits
whereas
in
my
opinion
both
infancy
and
childhood
at
every
stage
should
bring
forth
their
appropriate
fruits
in
other
words
the
child
of
the
most
tender
years
should
be
regarded
as
a
whole
and
not
as
the
mere
fragment
of
a
being
as
a
perfect
member
of
a
family
occupying
a
full
and
complete
only
a
more
limited
sphere
than
older
members
and
all
the
rules
and
regulations
and
arrangements
of
the
family
should
have
a
reference
to
this
point
so
long
as
a
child
is
reckoned
to
be
a
mere
cipher
in
creation
or
at
most
as
of
no
more
practical
importance
till
the
arrival
of
his
birth
day
or
some
other
equally
arbitrary
period
than
our
domestic
animals
that
is
of
just
sufficient
consequence
to
be
fed
and
caressed
and
fondled
and
made
a
pet
of
so
long
will
our
arrangements
be
made
with
reference
to
the
comfort
and
happiness
of
adults
there
may
indeed
be
here
and
there
a
child
chair
or
a
child
carriage
or
newspaper
or
book
but
there
will
seldom
be
except
by
stealth
any
free
juvenile
conversation
at
the
table
or
the
fireside
here
the
child
must
sit
as
a
blank
or
cypher
to
ruminate
on
the
past
or
to
receive
half
formed
and
passive
impressions
from
the
present
the
arrangements
of
the
infant
school
also
seem
designed
for
the
same
purpose
to
repress
as
much
as
possible
the
infantile
desire
for
amusement
not
that
this
was
their
original
nor
that
it
now
is
their
legitimate
intention
their
legitimate
object
is
or
should
be
not
to
develope
the
intellect
by
the
tender
brain
but
to
promote
cheerfulness
and
health
and
love
and
happiness
by
well
contrived
amusements
conducted
as
much
as
possible
in
the
open
air
and
by
unremitting
efforts
to
elicit
and
direct
the
affections
infant
schools
should
repress
rather
than
encourage
the
hard
study
of
books
lessons
at
this
age
should
be
drawn
chiefly
from
objects
in
the
garden
the
field
and
the
grove
from
the
flower
the
plant
the
tree
the
brook
the
bird
the
beast
the
worm
the
fly
the
human
body
the
sun
or
the
visible
heavens
these
lessons
whether
given
by
the
parent
as
constituting
a
part
of
the
family
arrangements
or
by
the
infant
or
primary
school
teacher
should
it
is
true
be
regarded
for
the
time
being
as
study
but
they
should
never
be
long
and
they
should
be
frequently
relieved
by
the
most
free
and
unrestrained
pastimes
and
gambols
of
the
young
on
the
green
grass
or
beside
the
rippling
stream
uninfluenced
or
at
least
unrepressed
by
those
who
are
set
over
them
the
public
or
common
school
overlooking
as
it
does
any
direct
attempts
to
make
provision
for
the
amusement
of
the
pupils
even
during
the
scanty
recess
that
is
afforded
them
once
in
three
hours
would
appear
to
a
stranger
on
this
planet
at
first
sight
to
be
designed
as
much
as
possible
to
defeat
every
intention
of
nature
with
reference
to
the
growth
of
the
human
frame
for
we
may
often
travel
many
hundred
miles
and
not
see
so
much
as
an
enclosed
play
ground
and
never
perhaps
any
direct
provision
for
particular
and
more
favorable
amusements
i
might
speak
of
other
schools
and
places
of
resort
for
children
and
proceed
to
show
how
all
our
arrangements
appear
to
be
the
offspring
of
a
species
of
utilitarianism
which
rejects
every
sport
whose
value
can
not
be
estimated
in
dollars
and
cents
i
might
even
refer
to
those
schools
of
our
country
where
these
ultra
utilitarian
notions
are
carried
to
an
extent
which
excludes
amusing
conversation
or
reading
even
during
and
devotes
the
hours
which
were
formerly
spent
in
recreation
to
manual
labor
of
some
productive
kind
or
but
i
forbear
enough
has
been
said
to
illustrate
the
position
i
have
taken
that
there
is
in
vogue
a
system
which
bears
the
marks
of
having
been
contrived
if
not
by
the
enemies
of
our
race
either
openly
or
covertly
at
least
by
those
whom
ignorance
renders
scarcely
less
at
war
with
the
general
happiness
now
i
would
not
deny
nor
attempt
to
deny
that
change
of
occupation
of
body
or
mind
is
of
itself
an
amusement
and
one
too
of
great
value
undoubtedly
it
is
so
to
some
children
studies
of
every
kind
are
an
amusement
and
there
are
few
indeed
to
whom
none
are
so
labor
with
many
when
alternated
with
study
is
amusing
and
yet
after
all
unless
such
labors
are
performed
in
company
where
light
and
cheerful
conversation
is
sure
to
keep
the
mind
away
from
the
subjects
about
which
it
has
just
been
engaged
i
am
afraid
that
the
purposes
for
which
amusements
were
designed
are
very
far
from
being
secured
but
perhaps
i
am
dwelling
too
long
on
the
general
principle
that
people
of
every
age
and
children
in
particular
need
and
must
have
amusements
whether
they
are
of
a
productive
kind
or
not
and
that
it
is
very
far
from
being
sufficient
were
it
either
practicable
or
desirable
to
turn
all
study
and
labor
into
amusement
footnote
i
will
even
say
more
distinctly
than
i
have
already
done
that
however
popular
the
contrary
opinion
may
be
neither
study
nor
work
ought
to
be
regarded
as
mere
amusement
i
would
it
is
true
take
every
possible
pains
to
render
both
work
and
study
agreeable
but
i
would
at
the
same
time
have
it
distinctly
understood
that
one
of
them
is
by
no
means
the
other
that
on
the
contrary
work
is
study
and
amusement
my
business
is
with
those
who
direct
the
first
dawnings
of
affection
and
intellect
principles
are
by
no
means
of
less
importance
on
this
account
but
the
limits
of
a
work
for
young
mothers
do
not
admit
of
anything
more
than
a
brief
discussion
of
their
importance
i
will
now
proceed
to
speak
of
some
of
the
more
common
amusements
of
the
nursery
i
have
seen
very
young
children
sit
on
the
floor
and
amuse
themselves
for
nearly
half
an
hour
together
with
piling
up
and
taking
down
small
wooden
cubes
of
different
sizes
some
of
them
instead
of
being
cubes
however
may
be
of
the
shape
of
bricks
their
ingenuity
while
they
are
scarcely
a
year
or
two
old
in
erecting
houses
temples
churches
is
sometimes
surprising
girls
as
well
as
boys
seem
to
be
greatly
amused
with
this
form
of
exercise
and
both
seem
to
be
little
less
gratified
in
destroying
than
in
rearing
their
lilliputian
edifices
next
to
the
latter
kind
of
amusement
is
the
viewing
of
pictures
it
is
surprising
at
what
an
early
age
children
may
be
taught
to
notice
miniature
representations
of
objects
living
objects
especially
representations
of
the
works
of
art
should
come
in
a
little
later
than
those
of
things
in
nature
i
know
a
father
who
prepares
volumes
of
pictures
solely
for
this
purpose
though
he
usually
regards
them
not
only
as
a
source
of
amusement
to
children
but
as
a
medium
of
instruction
battledoor
or
shuttlecock
may
be
taught
to
children
of
both
sexes
very
early
and
it
affords
a
healthy
and
almost
untiring
source
of
amusement
it
gives
activity
as
well
as
strength
to
the
muscles
or
moving
powers
and
has
many
other
important
advantages
there
is
some
danger
according
to
pierson
footnote
see
his
lecture
before
the
american
institute
of
instruction
of
distorting
the
spine
by
playing
at
shuttlecock
too
frequently
and
too
long
but
this
will
seldom
be
the
case
with
little
children
in
the
nursery
neither
shuttlecock
nor
any
other
amusement
will
secure
their
attention
long
enough
to
injure
them
very
much
perhaps
this
exercise
comes
nearer
to
my
ideas
of
a
perfect
amusement
than
almost
any
which
could
be
named
the
mind
is
agreeably
occupied
without
being
fatigued
and
if
the
amusements
are
proportioned
to
the
age
and
strength
of
the
child
there
is
very
little
fatigue
of
the
body
it
gives
moreover
great
practical
accuracy
to
the
eye
and
to
the
hand
a
is
much
recommended
for
the
nursery
i
have
had
no
opportunity
for
observing
the
effects
of
this
kind
of
amusement
but
if
it
is
one
half
as
valuable
as
some
suppose
i
should
be
inclined
to
recommend
it
but
i
am
opposed
to
fostering
in
the
rider
lessons
of
cruelty
by
arming
him
with
whips
and
spurs
if
the
young
are
ever
to
learn
to
ride
on
a
living
horse
the
exercises
of
the
will
most
certainly
be
a
sort
of
preparation
for
the
purpose
tops
and
marbles
afford
a
great
deal
of
rational
amusement
to
the
young
and
of
a
very
useful
kind
too
spinning
a
top
is
second
to
no
exercise
which
i
have
yet
mentioned
unless
it
is
playing
at
shuttlecock
dewees
recommends
a
small
backgammon
table
with
men
but
without
dice
he
says
also
that
children
as
soon
as
they
are
capable
of
comprehending
the
subject
should
be
taught
draughts
or
checkers
this
game
is
not
only
highly
amusing
but
also
very
instructive
in
another
place
he
heaps
additional
encomiums
upon
the
game
of
checkers
it
becomes
a
source
of
endless
amusement
he
says
as
it
never
tires
but
always
instructs
of
exercises
which
instruct
however
as
well
as
amuse
i
shall
speak
presently
the
amusements
called
morrice
fox
and
geese
with
which
some
of
the
children
of
almost
every
neighborhood
are
more
or
less
acquainted
are
of
the
same
general
character
and
tendency
as
checkers
so
is
a
play
sometimes
but
very
improperly
called
dice
in
which
two
parties
play
with
a
small
bundle
of
wooden
pins
not
unlike
knitting
pins
in
shape
but
shorter
the
writer
to
whom
i
have
referred
above
recommends
and
balls
of
proper
size
as
highly
useful
both
for
diversion
and
exercise
if
they
can
be
used
without
leading
to
bad
habits
and
bad
associations
i
think
they
may
be
useful
for
girls
who
demand
a
great
deal
more
of
exercise
both
within
doors
and
without
skipping
the
rope
is
an
excellent
amusement
so
also
is
swinging
both
of
these
exercises
may
be
used
either
out
of
doors
or
in
the
nursery
trundling
a
hoop
i
have
always
regarded
as
an
amusing
exercise
and
i
am
not
sorry
when
i
sometimes
see
girls
as
well
as
boys
engaged
in
it
under
the
eye
of
their
mothers
and
teachers
playing
ball
of
which
there
are
many
different
games
and
flying
kites
employ
a
large
proportion
if
not
all
of
the
muscles
of
the
body
in
such
a
manner
as
is
likely
to
confirm
the
strength
and
greatly
improve
the
health
the
same
may
be
said
of
skating
in
the
winter
and
swimming
in
the
summer
but
these
last
are
exercises
over
which
the
mother
can
not
ordinarily
have
very
much
control
under
the
head
of
amusements
it
only
remains
for
me
to
speak
of
a
few
juvenile
employments
of
a
mixed
nature
of
these
i
shall
treat
very
briefly
as
they
are
a
branch
of
the
subject
which
does
not
necessarily
come
within
the
compass
of
my
present
plan
they
are
exercises
too
which
should
more
properly
come
under
the
head
of
infantile
instruction
dissected
maps
afford
children
of
every
age
a
great
fund
of
amusement
but
much
caution
is
necessary
with
those
that
are
very
young
not
to
discourage
or
confound
them
by
showing
them
too
many
at
once
thus
if
we
cut
in
pieces
the
map
of
one
of
the
smaller
united
states
at
the
county
lines
or
the
whole
united
states
at
the
state
lines
it
is
quite
as
many
divisions
as
they
can
manage
cut
up
as
large
a
state
even
as
pennsylvania
or
new
york
is
into
counties
and
try
to
lead
them
to
amuse
themselves
by
putting
together
so
large
a
number
many
of
which
must
inevitably
very
closely
resemble
each
other
and
it
is
ten
to
one
but
you
bewilder
and
even
perplex
and
discourage
them
the
same
results
would
follow
from
cutting
up
even
the
whole
of
a
large
county
or
a
small
state
into
towns
i
have
usually
begun
with
little
children
by
requiring
them
to
put
together
the
eight
counties
of
the
small
state
of
connecticut
in
this
case
the
counties
are
not
only
few
but
there
is
a
very
striking
difference
in
their
shape
a
black
board
and
a
piece
of
chalk
along
with
a
little
ingenuity
on
the
part
of
the
mother
will
furnish
the
child
with
an
almost
endless
variety
of
amusement
let
him
attempt
to
imitate
almost
any
object
which
interests
him
whether
among
the
works
of
nature
or
art
however
rude
his
pictures
may
be
do
not
laugh
at
but
on
the
contrary
endeavor
to
encourage
him
he
may
also
be
permitted
to
imitate
letters
and
figures
the
elements
of
letters
too
both
printed
and
written
may
be
given
him
and
he
may
be
required
to
put
them
together
dissected
pictures
as
well
as
dissected
maps
and
letters
are
useful
and
to
most
children
very
acceptable
in
short
the
devices
of
an
ingenious
thinking
mother
for
the
amusement
of
her
very
young
children
are
almost
endless
and
the
great
danger
is
that
when
a
mother
once
enters
deeply
into
the
spirit
of
these
exercises
she
will
substitute
them
for
those
much
more
healthy
ones
which
have
been
already
mentioned
such
as
require
muscular
activity
or
may
be
performed
in
the
open
air

nothing
of
its
tendency
to
encourage
hypocrisy
is
wholly
unphilosophical
the
following
anecdote
may
serve
in
part
to
illustrate
my
meaning
it
is
said
to
have
been
related
by
dr
rush
a
gentleman
in
south
carolina
was
about
to
undergo
a
very
painful
surgical
operation
he
had
imbibed
the
idea
that
it
was
beneath
the
dignity
of
a
man
ever
to
say
or
do
anything
expressive
of
pain
he
therefore
refused
to
submit
to
the
usual
precaution
of
securing
the
hands
and
feet
by
bandages
declaring
to
his
surgeon
that
he
had
nothing
to
fear
from
his
being
untied
for
he
would
not
move
a
muscle
of
his
body
he
kept
his
word
it
is
true
but
he
died
instantly
after
the
operation
from
apoplexy
there
is
very
little
doubt
in
the
mind
of
any
physiologist
in
regard
to
the
cause
of
apoplexy
in
this
case
and
that
it
might
have
been
prevented
by
the
relief
which
is
always
afforded
by
groans
and
tears
it
is
i
believe
very
generally
known
that
in
the
profoundest
grief
people
do
not
and
can
not
shed
tears
and
that
when
the
begin
to
flow
it
affords
immediate
relief
i
do
not
undertake
to
argue
from
this
that
crying
is
so
important
either
to
the
young
or
the
old
that
it
is
ever
worth
while
to
excite
or
continue
it
by
artificial
means
or
that
a
habit
of
crying
so
easily
and
readily
acquired
by
the
young
is
not
to
be
guarded
against
as
a
serious
evil
my
object
was
first
to
show
the
folly
of
those
who
denounce
all
crying
and
secondly
to
point
out
some
of
its
advantages
in
the
hope
of
preventing
parents
from
going
to
that
extreme
which
borders
upon
stoicism
one
of
the
most
intelligent
men
i
ever
knew
frequently
made
it
his
boast
that
he
neither
laughed
nor
cried
on
any
occasion
and
on
being
told
that
both
laughing
and
crying
were
physiologically
useful
he
only
ridiculed
the
sentiment
crying
is
useful
to
very
young
infants
because
it
favors
the
passage
of
blood
in
their
lungs
where
it
had
not
before
been
accustomed
to
travel
and
where
its
motion
is
now
indispensable
and
it
not
only
promotes
the
circulation
of
the
blood
but
expands
the
of
the
lungs
and
thus
helps
forward
that
great
change
by
which
the
impure
blood
of
the
veins
is
changed
at
once
into
pure
blood
and
thus
rendered
fit
to
nourish
the
system
and
sustain
life
but
this
is
not
all
crying
strengthens
the
lungs
themselves
it
does
this
by
expanding
the
little
of
which
i
have
just
spoken
and
not
only
accustoms
them
to
being
stretched
at
a
period
of
all
others
the
most
favorable
for
this
purpose
but
frees
them
at
the
same
time
from
mucus
and
other
injurious
accumulations
they
therefore
who
oppose
an
infant
crying
know
not
what
they
do
so
far
is
it
from
being
hurtful
to
the
child
that
its
occasional
recurrence
is
as
we
have
already
seen
positively
useful
some
practitioners
of
medicine
in
some
of
the
more
trying
situations
in
which
human
nature
can
be
placed
even
encourage
their
patients
to
suffer
tears
to
flow
as
a
means
of
relief
infants
it
should
also
be
recollected
have
no
other
language
by
which
to
express
their
wants
and
feelings
than
sighs
and
tears
crying
is
not
always
an
expression
of
positive
pain
it
sometimes
indicates
hunger
and
thirst
and
sometimes
the
want
of
a
change
of
posture
this
last
consideration
deserves
great
attention
and
all
the
inconveniences
of
crying
ought
to
be
borne
cheerfully
for
the
sake
of
having
the
little
sufferer
remind
us
when
nature
demands
a
change
of
position
no
child
ought
to
be
permitted
to
remain
in
one
position
longer
than
two
hours
even
while
sleeping
nor
half
that
time
while
awake
and
if
nurses
and
mothers
will
overlook
this
matter
as
they
often
do
it
is
a
favorable
circumstance
that
the
child
should
remind
them
of
it
crying
has
been
called
the
waste
gate
of
the
human
system
the
door
of
escape
to
that
excess
of
excitability
which
sometimes
prevails
especially
among
children
and
nervous
adults
to
all
such
persons
it
is
healthy
most
undoubtedly
so
nor
do
i
know
that
its
occasional
recurrence
is
injurious
to
any
adult
a
fastidious
public
sentiment
to
the
contrary
notwithstanding
some
have
supposed
that
what
is
here
said
will
be
construed
by
the
young
mother
into
a
license
to
suffer
her
child
to
cry
unnecessarily
perhaps
say
they
she
is
a
laboring
woman
and
wishes
to
be
at
work
well
she
lays
down
her
child
in
the
cradle
or
on
the
bed
and
goes
to
her
work
presently
the
child
becoming
wet
perhaps
begins
to
cry
as
well
he
might
but
instead
of
going
to
him
and
taking
care
of
him
she
continues
at
her
employment
and
when
one
remonstrates
against
her
conduct
as
cruelty
she
pleads
the
authority
of
the
author
of
the
young
mother
all
this
may
happen
but
if
it
should
i
am
not
answerable
for
it
i
have
insisted
strongly
on
guarding
the
child
against
wet
clothing
and
on
watching
him
with
the
utmost
care
to
prevent
all
real
suffering
mothers
like
the
specimen
here
given
if
they
happen
to
have
a
little
sensibility
to
suffering
and
not
much
love
of
their
offspring
generally
know
of
a
shorter
way
to
quiet
their
infants
and
procure
time
to
work
than
that
which
is
here
mentioned
they
have
nothing
to
do
but
to
give
them
some
cordial
or
elixir
whose
basis
is
opium
startle
not
reader
at
the
statement
this
abominable
practice
is
followed
by
many
a
female
who
claims
the
sacred
name
of
mother
and
many
a
wretch
has
thus
in
her
ignorance
indolence
or
avarice
slowly
destroyed
her
children
i
repeat
therefore
that
i
do
not
think
my
remarks
on
crying
are
necessarily
liable
to
abuse
though
i
am
not
sure
that
there
are
not
a
few
individuals
to
be
found
who
may
apply
them
in
the
manner
above
mentioned
an
application
however
which
is
as
far
removed
from
the
original
intention
of
the
author
as
can
possibly
be
conceived

laughing
laugh
and
be
fat
laughing
is
healthy
a
common
error
monastic
notions
yet
too
prevalent
on
this
subject
laughing
like
crying
has
a
good
effect
on
the
infantile
lungs
nor
is
it
less
salutary
in
other
respects
laugh
and
be
fat
an
old
adage
has
its
meaning
and
also
its
philosophy
there
is
an
excess
however
to
which
laughing
no
less
than
crying
may
be
carried
and
which
we
can
not
too
carefully
avoid
but
how
little
to
be
envied
how
much
to
be
pitied
are
they
who
consider
it
a
weakness
and
a
sin
to
laugh
and
in
the
plenitude
of
their
wisdom
tell
us
that
saviour
of
mankind
never
when
i
hear
this
last
assertion
i
am
always
ready
to
ask
whether
the
individual
who
makes
it
has
read
a
new
revelation
or
a
new
gospel
for
certainly
none
of
the
sacred
books
which
i
have
seen
give
us
any
such
information
but
i
will
not
dwell
here
the
common
notion
on
this
subject
if
not
ridiculous
is
certainly
strange
i
will
only
add
that
come
into
vogue
as
it
might
have
done
there
is
no
opinion
more
unfounded
than
the
very
general
one
among
adults
that
children
should
be
uniformly
grave
and
that
just
in
proportion
as
they
laugh
and
appear
frolicsome
just
in
the
same
proportion
are
they
out
of
the
way
and
deserving
of
reprehension
it
is
strange
that
it
should
be
so
but
i
have
seen
many
parents
who
were
miserable
because
their
children
were
sportive
and
joyful
oh
when
will
the
days
of
monkish
sadness
and
austerity
be
over
and
the
public
sentiment
in
the
christian
world
get
right
on
this
subject

to

let

of
hounds
and
horses
and

and
at
the

time
to
think
themselves
above
the
concerns
of
the
nursery
we
may
indeed
read
of
a
cato
once
in
three
thousand
years
who
was
in
the
habit
of
quitting
all
other
business
in
order
to
be
present
when
the
nurse
washed
and
rubbed
his
child
but
our
passion
for
gain
in
the
present
age
is
so
much
more
absorbing
and
than
the
passion
for
military
glory
that
we
can
not
expect
many
catos
oh
no
all
or
nearly
all
must
devolve
on
the
mother
the
father
has
no

his

what
belongs
to
the

if
she
can
be
duly
awakened
may
be
at

done
what
belongs
to
the
father
must
i
fear
be
left
undone
i
am
accustomed
to
regard
every
day
even
of
the
infant
as
a
miniature
life
i
am
moreover
accustomed
to
consider
mental
and
bodily
vigor
not
only
for
each
separate
day
but
for
life

sec
for
generally
speaking
the
night
is
the
appropriate
season
for
repose
but
in
early
infancy
it
is
hour
i
have
already
spoken
of
the
vast
amount
of
sleep
which
the
infant
requires
as
well
as
of
many
other
circumstances
connected
with
it
requiring
our
attention
suffer
me
however
to
enlarge
at
the
risk
of
a
little
repetition
what
time
the
infant
is
awake
should
be
during
the
day
it
is
of
very
great
importance
in
the
formation
of
good
habits
that
he
should
be
undressed
and
put
to
bed
at
evening
with
as
much
regularity
as
if
be
had
not
slept
during
the
day
for
a
single
moment
it
is
also
important
that
he
be
permitted
to
sleep
during
the
whole
night
as
uninterruptedly
as
possible
and
that
when
he
is
aroused
to
have
his
position
or
diapers
changed
or
to
receive
food
it
should
be
done
with
little
parade
and
noise
and
with
as
little
light
as
possible
all
persons
old
as
well
as
young
sleep
more
quietly
in
a
dark
room
than
in
one
where
a
light
is
burning
i
am
well
aware
that
the
course
here
recommended
may
be
carried
to
an
excess
which
will
utterly
defeat
the
object
intended
since
there
are
children
to
be
found
who
are
so
trained
in
this
respect
that
the
lightest
tread
upon
the
floor
will
awake
and
perhaps
frighten
them
but
this
is
an
excess
which
is
not
required
all
that
is
necessary
during
the
night
is
a
reasonable
degree
of
silence
in
order
to
induce
the
habit
of
continued
rest
if
possible
in
the
day
time
on
the
contrary
fatigue
will
impel
a
child
to
sleep
occasionally
even
in
the
midst
of
noise
i
am
not
sure
that
the
habit
of
sleeping
in
the
midst
of
noise
is
not
worth
a
little
pains
on
the
part
of
the
mother
nor
is
it
improbable
that
a
habit
of
this
kind
once
acquired
by
the
infant
might
ultimately
be
extended
to
the
night
so
that
even
in
regard
to
that
season
might
gradually
be
laid
aside
north
a
distinguished
medical
practitioner
in
hartford
confirms
the
foregoing
sentiments
and
adds
that
he
deems
it
an
imperious
duty
of
those
parents
who
wish
well
to
their
infants
to
form
in
them
the
habit
of
sleeping
when
fatigued
whether
the
room
be
quiet
or
noisy
with
his
children
no
cradles
or
opiates
are
needed
or
used
sec
for
some
time
after
its
birth
the
infant
should
sleep
near
its
mother
though
not
in
the
same
bed
the
bedstead
should
be
of
the
usual
height
of
bedsteads
and
should
be
enclosed
with
a
railing
sufficient
to
secure
the
infant
from
falling
out
but
not
of
such
a
structure
as
to
hinder
in
any
degree
a
free
circulation
of
the
air
the
reasons
why
a
child
ought
to
sleep
alone
and
not
with
the
mother
or
nurse
are
numerous
but
the
following
are
the
principal
the
heat
accumulated
by
the
bodies
of
the
mother
and
child
both
is
often
too
great
for
health
the
air
is
too
impure
i
have
already
spoken
of
the
change
in
the
purity
of
the
air
which
is
produced
by
breathing
in
it
it
is
bad
enough
for
two
adults
to
sleep
in
the
same
bed
breathing
over
and
over
again
the
impure
air
as
they
must
do
more
or
less
even
if
the
bed
is
very
large
but
it
is
still
worse
for
infants
their
lungs
demand
atmospheric
air
in
its
utmost
purity
and
if
denied
it
they
must
eventually
suffer
but
besides
the
change
of
the
air
by
breathing
the
surface
of
the
body
is
perpetually
changing
it
in
the
same
manner
as
was
stated
in
the
chapter
on
ventilation
now
a
child
will
almost
inevitably
breathe
a
stream
of
this
bad
air
as
it
issues
from
the
bed
and
what
is
still
worse
it
is
very
apt
in
spite
of
every
precaution
to
get
its
head
covered
up
with
the
clothes
where
it
can
hardly
breathe
anything
else
this
if
frequently
repeated
is
slow
but
certain
death
as
much
so
as
if
the
child
were
to
drink
poison
in
moderate
quantities
let
me
not
be
told
that
this
is
an
exaggeration
that
thousands
of
mothers
make
it
a
point
to
cover
up
the
beads
of
their
infants
and
that
notwithstanding
this
they
are
as
healthy
as
the
infants
of
their
neighbors
i
have
not
said
that
they
would
droop
and
die
while
infants
the
fumes
of
lead
which
is
a
certain
poison
may
be
inhaled
and
yet
the
child
or
adult
who
inhales
them
may
live
on
in
tolerable
health
for
many
years
but
suffer
he
must
in
the
end
in
spite
of
every
effort
and
every
hope
so
must
the
child
whose
head
is
covered
habitually
with
the
bed
clothing
where
it
is
compelled
to
breathe
not
only
the
air
spoiled
by
its
own
skin
but
also
that
which
is
spoiled
by
the
much
larger
surface
of
body
of
the
mother
or
nurse
but
i
have
proof
on
this
subject
friedlander
in
his
physical
education
says
expressly
that
in
great
britain
alone
between
the
years
and
no
less
than
children
died
in
consequence
of
this
practice
of
allowing
them
to
sleep
near
their
nurses
i
was
at
first
disposed
to
doubt
the
accuracy
of
this
most
remarkable
statement
but
when
i
consider
the
respectability
of
the
authority
from
which
it
emanated
and
that
it
is
only
about
a
year
for
that
great
empire
i
can
not
doubt
that
the
estimate
is
substantially
correct
what
a
sacrifice
at
the
shrine
of
ignorance
and
folly
it
should
be
added
in
this
place
both
to
confirm
the
foregoing
sentiment
and
to
show
that
british
mothers
and
nurses
are
not
alone
that
dewees
has
witnessed
in
the
circle
of
his
practice
four
deaths
from
the
same
cause
if
every
physician
in
the
united
states
has
met
with
as
many
cases
of
the
kind
in
proportion
to
his
practice
as
the
evil
is
about
as
great
in
this
country
as
says
it
is
in
great
britain
if
a
child
sleeps
alone
it
can
not
of
course
be
liable
to
as
much
suffering
of
this
kind
as
if
it
slept
with
another
person
though
much
precaution
will
still
be
necessary
to
keep
its
head
uncovered
and
prevent
its
inhaling
air
spoiled
by
its
own
lungs
and
skin
there
is
one
more
evil
which
will
be
avoided
by
having
a
child
sleep
alone
many
a
mother
has
seriously
injured
her
child
by
pressure
i
do
not
here
allude
to
those
monsters
in
human
nature
whose
besotted
habits
have
been
the
frequent
cause
of
the
suffocation
and
death
of
their
offspring
but
to
the
more
careful
and
tender
mother
who
would
sooner
injure
herself
than
her
own
child
such
mothers
even
have
been
known
to
dislocate
or
fracture
a
limb
footnote
there
may
be
instances
where
the
debility
of
an
infant
will
be
so
great
that
the
mother
or
a
nurse
must
sleep
with
it
to
keep
it
warm
but
such
cases
of
disease
are
very
rare
to
cap
the
climax
of
error
in
this
matter
some
mothers
allow
their
infants
to
lie
on
their
arm
as
a
pillow
this
practice
not
only
exposes
them
to
all
or
nearly
all
the
evils
which
have
been
mentioned
but
to
one
more
viz
the
danger
of
being
thrown
from
the
bed
a
young
mother
with
whom
i
was
well
acquainted
was
sleeping
one
night
with
her
infant
on
her
arm
when
she
made
a
sudden
and
rather
violent
effort
to
turn
in
the
bed
in
doing
which
she
threw
the
child
upon
the
floor
with
such
violence
as
to
fracture
its
little
skull
and
cause
its
death
enough
i
trust
has
now
been
said
to
convince
every
reasonable
young
mother
where
absolute
poverty
does
not
preclude
comfort
and
health
that
her
child
ought
never
to
be
permitted
to
sleep
in
the
same
bed
with
her
but
that
it
should
be
placed
on
a
bedstead
by
itself
at
a
short
distance
from
her
and
properly
guarded
from
accidents
and
above
all
from
inhaling
impure
air
at
a
suitable
age
a
child
may
be
removed
from
the
nursery
to
a
separate
chamber
here
if
the
circumstances
permit
it
should
still
sleep
by
itself
and
if
the
bedstead
be
somewhat
lower
than
ordinary
and
the
room
be
not
too
small
it
will
need
no
watching
perhaps
this
may
be
the
proper
place
to
say
that
there
are
more
reasons
than
one
and
some
of
them
are
of
a
moral
nature
too
why
a
child
should
continue
to
sleep
alone
after
it
leaves
the
nursery
nor
is
it
sufficient
to
prohibit
its
sleeping
with
younger
persons
and
yet
crowd
it
into
the
bed
with
an
aged
grandfather
or
grandmother
or
with
both
there
is
no
excuse
for
a
course
like
this
except
the
iron
hand
of
necessity
and
even
then
i
should
prefer
to
have
a
child
of
mine
sleep
on
the
hard
floor
at
least
during
the
summer
season
rather
than
with
an
aged
person
let
it
not
be
supposed
i
have
imbibed
the
fashionable
idea
that
it
is
unhealthy
for
the
young
to
sleep
with
the
old
i
know
this
doctrine
has
many
learned
advocates
and
yet
i
doubt
its
correctness
i
believe
that
the
manners
and
habits
of
the
old
may
injure
the
young
who
sleep
with
them
and
i
know
that
they
render
the
air
impure
like
other
people
but
i
can
not
see
why
the
mere
circumstance
of
their
being
should
be
a
source
of
unhealthiness
to
their
younger
still
i
say
that
there
are
reasons
enough
against
the
practice
i
am
opposing
without
this
some
parents
allow
dogs
and
cats
to
sleep
with
children
others
have
a
prejudice
against
cats
but
not
against
dogs
the
truth
is
that
they
both
contaminate
the
air
by
respiration
and
perspiration
in
the
same
manner
that
adults
do
and
aside
from
the
fact
that
they
are
often
infested
by
lice
and
other
insects
and
addicted
to
uncleanly
habits
they
ought
always
to
be
excluded
and
with
iron
bars
and
bolts
if
necessary
from
the
beds
of
children
but
of
this
too
i
have
treated
elsewhere
sec
of
the
the
general
importance
of
pure
air
has
been
mentioned
i
have
spoken
of
the
elements
of
the
atmosphere
in
which
we
live
of
the
manner
in
which
it
may
be
vitiated
and
the
consequences
to
health
i
have
shown
perhaps
at
sufficient
length
the
impropriety
of
washing
drying
and
ironing
clothes
in
the
room
where
a
child
is
kept
of
cooking
in
the
room
especially
on
a
stove
of
suffering
the
floor
or
clothes
particularly
those
of
the
child
to
remain
long
wet
in
the
room
of
smoking
tobacco
using
spirits
burning
oil
with
too
long
a
wick
all
which
has
thus
been
said
of
the
purity
of
the
air
of
the
nursery
generally
is
applicable
to
that
of
all
sleeping
rooms
it
is
an
important
point
gained
when
we
can
secure
a
nursery
with
folding
doors
in
the
centre
so
as
when
we
please
to
make
two
rooms
of
it
in
that
case
the
division
in
which
the
bed
is
can
be
completely
ventilated
a
little
before
night
and
thus
be
comparatively
pure
for
the
reception
of
both
the
mother
and
the
child
shall
the
windows
and
doors
where
a
child
sleeps
be
kept
closed
or
shall
they
be
suffered
to
remain
open
a
part
or
the
whole
of
the
night
this
must
be
determined
by
circumstances
if
there
are
no
doors
but
such
as
communicate
with
apartments
whose
air
is
equally
impure
with
that
in
which
the
child
is
it
is
preferable
to
keep
them
closed
if
the
windows
can
not
be
opened
without
exposing
the
child
to
a
current
of
air
it
is
perhaps
the
less
of
two
evils
not
to
open
them
but
we
are
not
usually
driven
to
such
extremities
in
some
instances
windows
are
constructed
and
all
of
them
ought
to
be
so
that
they
can
be
lowered
from
the
top
when
this
is
not
the
case
something
can
be
placed
before
the
window
to
break
the
current
so
that
it
need
not
fall
directly
upon
the
child
closing
the
blinds
will
partially
effect
this
where
blinds
exist
i
have
known
many
an
individual
who
was
in
the
habit
of
sleeping
with
his
windows
open
during
the
whole
year
and
without
any
obvious
evil
consequences
gregory
was
of
this
habit
but
if
adults
not
trained
to
it
can
acquire
such
a
habit
with
impunity
with
how
much
more
safety
could
children
be
trained
to
it
from
the
very
first
year
macnish
says
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
a
gentle
current
pervading
our
sleeping
apartments
is
in
the
highest
degree
essential
to
health
this
consideration
i
mean
the
impurity
of
sleeping
rooms
even
after
every
precaution
has
been
used
to
keep
them
ventilated
affords
one
of
the
strongest
inducements
to
going
abroad
early
in
the
morning
especially
when
there
is
no
other
room
which
either
adults
or
children
can
occupy
while
the
nursery
or
chamber
is
aired
and
ventilated
the
utility
of
early
i
hope
no
one
can
doubt
but
some
have
doubts
of
the
propriety
of
going
abroad
till
the
dew
has
passed
away
such
should
be
reminded
by
the
foregoing
train
of
remarks
that
early
walking
may
be
a
choice
of
evils
and
that
if
it
on
the
whole
advantageous
to
adults
it
can
not
be
less
so
to
children
and
as
soon
as
the
sun
has
chased
away
the
vapors
of
the
night
if
the
weather
is
tolerable
most
children
should
be
carried
abroad
sec
this
should
never
be
of
feathers
there
are
many
reasons
for
this
prohibition
especially
to
the
feeble
they
are
too
warm
infants
should
by
all
means
be
kept
warm
enough
as
i
have
all
along
insisted
but
excess
of
heat
excites
or
stimulates
the
skin
causing
an
unnatural
degree
of
perspiration
and
thus
inducing
weakness
or
debility
when
we
first
enter
a
room
in
which
there
is
a
feather
bed
which
has
been
occupied
during
the
night
we
are
struck
with
the
offensive
smell
of
the
air
this
is
owing
to
a
variety
of
causes
one
of
which
probably
is
that
beds
of
this
kind
are
better
adapted
to
absorb
and
retain
the
effluvia
of
our
bodies
but
let
the
causes
be
what
they
may
the
effects
ought
if
possible
to
be
avoided
for
both
experience
and
authority
combine
to
pronounce
them
very
injurious
feather
beds
if
used
in
the
nursery
will
inevitably
discharge
more
or
less
of
dust
and
down
both
of
which
are
injurious
to
the
tender
lungs
of
the
infant
mattresses
are
better
for
persons
of
every
age
than
soft
feather
beds
they
may
be
made
of
horse
hair
or
moss
but
hair
is
the
best
if
the
mattress
does
not
appear
to
be
warm
enough
for
the
very
young
infant
a
blanket
may
be
spread
over
it
dewees
says
that
in
case
mattresses
can
not
be
had
the
sacking
bottom
may
be
substituted
or
even
the
floor
at
least
in
warm
weather
for
almost
anything
he
adds
is
preferable
to
feathers
macnish
in
his
philosophy
of
sleep
objects
strongly
to
air
beds
and
says
that
he
can
assert
from
experience
that
they
are
the
very
worst
that
can
possibly
be
employed
my
theories
for
i
have
had
no
experience
on
the
subject
would
lead
me
to
a
similar
conclusion
a
british
writer
of
eminence
assures
us
that
the
higher
classes
in
ireland
to
a
considerable
extent
accustom
themselves
and
their
infants
to
sleep
on
bags
of
cut
straw
overspread
with
blankets
and
a
light
coverlid
and
that
the
custom
is
rapidly
finding
favor
i
have
slept
on
straw
both
in
winter
and
summer
for
many
years
yet
i
am
always
warm
and
those
who
know
my
habits
say
i
use
less
on
my
bed
than
almost
any
individual
whom
they
have
ever
known
i
have
no
hostility
to
soft
beds
especially
for
young
children
and
feeble
adults
could
softness
be
secured
without
much
heat
and
relaxation
of
the
system
on
the
contrary
it
is
certainly
desirable
in
itself
to
have
the
bed
so
soft
that
as
large
a
proportion
of
the
surface
of
the
body
may
rest
on
it
as
possible
but
i
consider
hardness
as
a
much
smaller
evil
than
feathers
it
is
worthy
of
remark
how
generally
physicians
for
the
last
hundred
years
have
recommended
hard
beds
especially
straw
beds
or
hair
mattresses
to
their
more
feeble
and
delicate
patients
this
fact
might
at
least
quiet
our
apprehensions
in
regard
to
their
tendency
on
those
who
are
accustomed
to
them
in
early
infancy
some
writers
on
these
subjects
appear
to
doubt
whether
after
all
that
they
say
they
shall
have
much
influence
on
mothers
in
inducing
them
to
give
up
feather
beds
for
their
infants
but
they
need
not
be
so
faithless
multitudes
have
already
been
reformed
by
their
writings
and
multitudes
larger
still
would
be
so
could
they
gain
access
to
them
it
is
a
most
serious
evil
that
they
are
often
so
written
and
published
that
comparatively
few
mothers
will
ever
possess
them
the
pillow
as
well
as
the
bed
should
be
rather
hard
and
its
thickness
should
be
much
less
than
is
usual
or
we
shall
do
mischief
by
bending
the
neck
and
thus
compressing
the
vessels
and
obstructing
the
circulation
of
the
blood
but
on
this
subject
i
will
say
more
when
i
come
to
treat
on
posture
the
child
bed
should
not
be
placed
near
the
wall
on
account
of
dampness
there
is
also
during
the
summer
another
reason
should
lightning
strike
the
house
it
will
be
much
more
apt
to
injure
those
who
are
near
the
wall
than
other
persons
as
it
seldom
leaves
the
wall
to
pass
over
the
central
part
of
the
room
curtains
are
not
only
useless
but
injurious
they
prevent
a
free
circulation
of
the
air
everything
which
has
this
tendency
must
be
studiously
guarded
against
in
the
management
of
infants
nothing
is
more
injurious
to
the
old
or
the
young
than
damp
beds
and
damp
covering
it
behoves
especially
all
those
who
have
the
care
of
infants
to
see
that
everything
about
their
beds
is
thoroughly
dry
the
walls
and
clothes
should
also
be
dry
and
wet
clothes
should
never
be
hung
up
in
the
room
by
neglecting
these
precautions
colds
rheumatisms
inflammations
fevers
consumptions
and
death
may
ensue
many
a
person
loses
his
health
and
not
a
few
their
lives
in
this
way
the
author
of
this
work
was
once
thrown
into
a
fever
from
such
a
cause
warming
the
bed
is
in
all
cases
a
bad
practice
while
in
the
nursery
if
the
air
be
kept
at
a
proper
temperature
there
will
be
no
need
of
it
after
the
child
is
assigned
to
a
separate
chamber
its
enervating
tendency
would
result
in
more
evil
than
good
it
is
better
to
let
the
bed
became
gradually
heated
by
the
body
in
a
natural
and
healthy
way
no
person
and
above
all
no
infant
should
be
suffered
to
sleep
in
a
bed
that
has
been
recently
occupied
by
the
sick
the
bed
and
all
the
clothes
should
first
be
thoroughly
aired
could
we
see
with
our
eyes
at
once
how
rapidly
these
bodies
of
ours
fill
the
air
and
even
the
beds
we
sleep
in
with
carbonic
acid
and
other
hurtful
gases
and
impurities
even
while
in
health
but
much
more
so
in
sickness
we
should
be
cautious
of
exposing
the
lungs
of
the
tender
infant
in
such
an
atmosphere
until
everything
had
been
properly
cleansed
and
the
apartments
properly
ventilated
sec
the
covering
of
the
bed
should
be
sufficiently
warm
but
never
any
warmer
than
is
absolutely
necessary
to
protect
the
child
from
chilliness
the
lightest
covering
which
will
secure
this
object
is
the
best
perhaps
there
is
nothing
in
use
that
with
so
little
weight
secures
so
much
heat
as
what
are
called
comfortables
the
clothes
should
not
be
tucked
up
at
the
sides
and
foot
of
the
bed
with
too
much
care
and
exactness
for
when
the
bed
is
once
warmed
thoroughly
with
the
child
body
the
admission
of
a
little
fresh
air
into
it
when
he
elevates
or
otherwise
moves
his
limbs
can
do
no
harm
but
do
much
of
good
in
the
way
of
ventilation
i
deem
it
important
moreover
to
inure
children
very
early
to
little
partial
exposures
of
this
kind
those
mothers
who
from
and
want
of
correct
information
on
the
subject
pursue
a
contrary
course
and
consider
it
as
almost
certain
death
to
have
a
particle
of
fresh
air
reach
the
bodies
of
their
infants
during
their
slumbers
are
generally
sure
to
outwit
themselves
and
defeat
their
very
intentions
for
by
being
thus
tender
of
their
children
it
often
turns
out
that
whenever
the
mother
is
ill
or
when
on
any
other
account
she
ceases
to
watch
over
them
and
such
times
must
in
general
sooner
or
later
come
they
are
much
more
liable
to
take
cold
or
sustain
other
injury
should
they
be
exposed
than
if
they
had
been
treated
more
rationally
i
knew
a
mother
who
would
not
trust
her
children
to
take
care
of
their
own
beds
on
retiring
to
rest
as
long
as
they
remained
in
her
house
even
though
they
were
twenty
or
thirty
years
old
but
they
had
no
better
or
firmer
constitutions
than
the
other
children
of
the
same
neighborhood
hardly
anything
can
be
more
injurious
than
covering
the
head
with
the
bed
clothes
and
yet
some
mothers
and
nurses
cover
in
this
way
not
only
their
own
heads
but
those
of
their
children
i
have
elsewhere
shown
how
impure
the
air
is
which
is
imprisoned
under
the
bed
clothes
i
hope
those
mothers
who
are
willing
to
destroy
by
covering
up
their
heads
while
they
sleep
will
at
least
have
mercy
on
their
unoffending
infants
sec
the
grand
rule
on
this
point
is
to
wear
as
little
dress
during
sleep
as
possible
some
mothers
not
only
suffer
their
infants
to
sleep
in
the
same
shirt
cap
and
stockings
that
they
have
worn
during
the
day
but
add
a
night
gown
to
the
rest
no
cap
should
be
worn
during
the
night
any
more
than
in
the
day
time
or
if
the
foolish
practice
has
been
adopted
for
the
day
it
should
be
discontinued
at
night
it
is
enough
for
those
adults
whose
long
hair
would
otherwise
be
dishevelled
to
wear
night
caps
and
subject
themselves
as
they
inevitably
do
to
catarrh
and
periodical
headache
children
heads
should
have
nothing
on
them
by
night
nor
even
by
day
except
to
defend
them
from
the
rain
or
the
hot
rays
of
the
sun
the
stockings
too
should
be
wholly
laid
aside
at
night
unless
in
the
case
of
those
who
are
feeble
apt
to
have
their
feet
cold
or
particularly
liable
to
bowel
complaints
such
may
be
allowed
to
sleep
in
their
stockings
but
not
in
those
which
have
been
worn
all
the
day
indeed
neither
children
nor
adults
should
ever
wear
a
single
garment
in
the
night
which
they
have
worn
during
the
day
the
reason
is
that
there
are
too
many
causes
of
impurity
in
operation
while
we
sleep
without
our
wearing
the
clothes
in
which
we
have
been
perspiring
during
the
and
which
must
be
already
more
or
less
filled
with
the
effluvia
of
our
bodies
it
is
a
very
easy
thing
to
have
a
loose
night
gown
to
supply
the
place
of
the
shirt
we
have
worn
during
the
day
and
if
nothing
else
is
convenient
a
spare
shirt
will
answer
but
both
a
night
gown
and
shirt
should
never
be
admitted
especially
in
warm
weather
the
garment
to
supply
the
place
of
the
shirt
during
the
night
may
be
of
calico
in
the
summer
and
of
flannel
in
the
winter
the
collar
and
wristbands
of
this
night
dress
should
be
loose
and
the
whole
garment
should
be
large
and
long
no
article
of
dress
should
ever
press
upon
our
bodies
so
as
in
the
least
to
impede
the
circulation
and
for
this
reason
it
is
that
writers
on
physical
education
have
inveighed
so
much
against
cravats
straps
garters
this
caution
so
important
to
all
is
doubly
so
to
young
mothers
on
whom
devolves
the
management
of
the
tender
infant
when
the
child
has
been
perspiring
freely
during
the
evening
just
before
he
is
undressed
or
when
he
has
just
been
subjected
to
the
warm
bath
it
may
be
well
to
use
a
little
care
in
undressing
and
exchanging
clothes
to
prevent
taking
cold
though
it
should
ever
be
remembered
that
those
children
who
are
managed
on
a
rational
system
will
bear
slight
exposures
with
far
more
safety
than
they
who
have
been
managed
at
random
sometimes
indeed
with
great
tenderness
but
at
others
wholly
neglected
sec
of
the
in
early
infancy
children
who
are
not
stuffed
rather
than
fed
may
occasionally
be
permitted
to
sleep
on
their
backs
especially
if
they
incline
to
do
so
but
it
will
be
well
to
encourage
them
to
sleep
on
one
side
as
soon
as
you
can
without
great
inconvenience
the
right
side
as
a
general
rule
is
preferable
because
the
stomach
which
lies
towards
the
left
side
is
thus
left
uncompressed
and
digestion
undisturbed
i
would
not
however
require
a
child
to
lie
always
on
the
right
side
but
would
occasionally
change
his
position
lest
he
should
become
unable
to
sleep
at
all
except
in
a
particular
manner
i
have
said
elsewhere
that
the
head
ought
to
be
a
little
raised
especially
if
the
child
is
liable
to
diseases
of
the
brain
but
this
remark
rather
hastily
thrown
out
requires
explanation
there
is
so
much
blood
sent
by
the
heart
to
the
head
and
upper
parts
of
the
system
of
infants
as
to
predispose
those
parts
especially
the
brain
to
disease
in
a
horizontal
position
of
the
body
there
is
more
blood
sent
to
the
brain
than
when
the
body
is
erect
this
will
show
the
reader
at
once
that
if
the
infant
is
peculiarly
exposed
to
diseases
of
the
brain
and
it
certainly
is
so
he
ought
to
remain
in
a
horizontal
posture
as
little
as
possible
except
during
sleep
and
that
even
then
it
is
desirable
to
make
his
bed
in
such
a
manner
as
to
elevate
the
head
and
shoulders
as
much
as
we
can
without
compressing
the
lungs
or
obstructing
the
circulation
in
the
neck
i
recommend
therefore
to
raise
the
head
of
an
infant
bedstead
a
little
higher
than
the
foot
though
not
so
much
as
to
incline
him
to
slide
downwards
into
the
bed
for
that
would
be
to
produce
one
evil
in
curing
another
sir
charles
bell
thinks
that
the
common
disease
of
infants
called
arises
from
their
being
permitted
to
sleep
on
their
backs
and
that
by
breaking
up
the
habit
of
lying
in
this
position
and
accustoming
them
to
lie
on
their
sides
we
shall
prevent
it
i
doubt
whether
the
effect
here
referred
to
is
ever
the
result
of
such
a
cause
still
i
am
as
much
opposed
to
the
of
sleeping
on
the
back
as
sir
charles
bell
it
is
quite
injurious
to
free
respiration
closely
allied
to
the
subject
of
bodily
position
in
general
is
the
state
of
particular
organs
especially
the
stomach
and
the
senses
i
have
already
intimated
that
in
order
to
have
an
infant
sleep
quietly
it
is
desirable
to
darken
the
room
this
is
the
more
necessary
where
infants
are
unnaturally
wakeful
in
such
cases
not
only
light
should
be
excluded
from
the
eye
but
sounds
from
the
ear
odors
from
the
nostrils
a
remarkably
full
stomach
is
in
the
way
of
going
quietly
to
sleep
whether
the
person
be
old
or
young
neither
infants
nor
adults
ought
to
take
food
for
some
time
previous
to
their
going
to
sleep
for
the
night
great
bodily
heat
as
well
as
too
great
cold
is
also
unfavorable
if
too
hot
the
temperature
of
the
infant
should
be
somewhat
reduced
by
exposure
to
the
air
if
too
cold
it
should
be
raised
in
a
natural
healthy
and
appropriate
manner
sec
of
the
in
giving
directions
how
to
procure
pleasant
dreams
franklin
mentions
as
a
highly
important
requisition
the
possession
of
a
quiet
conscience
a
wise
prescription
no
doubt
but
infants
as
well
as
adults
in
order
to
sleep
quietly
should
have
their
minds
and
feelings
in
a
state
of
tranquillity
the
youngest
child
has
its
troubles
and
it
is
highly
important
if
not
indispensable
to
sleep
that
the
mother
take
all
reasonable
pains
to
remove
them
before
sleep
is
induced
we
sometimes
hear
about
children
crying
themselves
to
sleep
as
if
it
were
a
matter
of
no
consequence
and
sometimes
as
if
it
were
on
the
contrary
rather
desirable
but
is
the
sleep
of
an
adult
satisfying
who
goes
to
bed
in
trouble
and
only
sleeps
because
nature
is
so
exhausted
that
she
can
not
bear
the
protracted
watchfulness
any
longer
why
then
should
we
expect
it
in
the
case
of
the
infant
i
know
an
excellent
father
who
is
so
far
from
believing
this
doctrine
that
he
silences
the
cries
of
his
child
by
the
word
of
command
and
believes
that
in
so
doing
he
promotes
both
his
health
and
his
happiness
he
would
no
more
let
him
cry
himself
to
sleep
than
he
would
let
him
cough
himself
to
sleep
though
both
crying
and
coughing
in
their
places
may
be
and
undoubtedly
are
salutary
whatever
may
be
the
age
and
circumstances
of
an
individual
he
ought
to
retire
for
rest
with
a
cheerful
mind
all
anxiety
about
the
future
all
regret
about
the
past
all
plans
even
in
regard
to
the
business
or
amusement
of
the
morrow
should
be
kept
wholly
out
of
the
mind
we
should
yield
ourselves
up
to
the
arms
of
sleep
with
the
same
quietude
as
if
life
were
finished
and
we
had
nothing
more
to
do
or
think
of
sec
of
the
soundness
as
well
as
other
qualities
of
sleep
differs
greatly
in
different
individuals
and
even
in
the
same
night
with
the
same
individual
in
different
circumstances
the
first
four
or
five
hours
of
sleep
are
usually
more
sound
than
the
remainder
hardly
anything
will
interrupt
the
repose
of
some
persons
during
the
early
part
of
the
night
while
they
awake
afterwards
at
the
slightest
noise
or
movement
the
chirping
of
a
cricket
or
the
playing
of
a
kitten
in
profound
sleep
we
probably
dream
very
little
if
at
all
but
in
other
circumstances
we
are
constantly
disturbed
by
dreaming
and
sometimes
start
and
wake
in
the
greatest
anxiety
or
horror
nightmare
is
generally
accompanied
by
dreams
of
the
most
distressing
kind
we
imagine
a
wild
beast
or
a
serpent
in
pursuit
of
us
or
a
rock
is
detached
from
some
neighboring
cliff
and
is
about
to
roll
upon
and
crush
us
and
yet
all
our
efforts
to
fly
are
unavailing
we
seem
chained
to
the
spot
but
while
in
the
very
jaws
of
destruction
perhaps
we
awake
trembling
and
palpitating
and
weary
as
if
something
of
a
serious
nature
had
really
happened
in
the
case
of
nightmare
it
is
more
than
probable
that
we
fall
asleep
with
our
stomachs
too
heavily
loaded
with
food
or
with
a
smaller
quantity
of
that
which
is
highly
indigestible
or
it
may
sometimes
arise
from
an
improper
position
of
the
body
such
as
disturbs
the
action
of
the
stomach
or
lungs
or
of
both
these
organs
lying
on
the
back
when
we
first
go
to
sleep
is
very
apt
to
produce
nightmare
but
distressing
dreams
often
follow
an
evening
of
anxious
cares
especially
if
those
cares
preyed
upon
us
for
the
last
half
hour
and
also
after
late
suppers
even
if
they
are
light
and
late
reading
hence
the
injunctions
of
the
last
section
hence
too
the
importance
of
taking
our
last
meal
two
or
three
hours
before
sleep
and
of
engaging
during
these
hours
in
cheerful
conversation
and
in
the
social
and
private
duties
of
religion
family
and
private
worship
in
the
evening
are
enjoined
no
less
by
philosophy
than
they
are
by
christianity
and
every
young
mother
will
do
well
to
understand
this
matter
and
train
her
offspring
accordingly
that
sleep
from
which
we
are
easily
roused
is
the
healthiest
says
macnish
very
profound
slumber
partakes
of
the
nature
of
apoplexy
i
should
say
rather
that
a
medium
between
the
two
extremes
is
healthiest
profound
apoplectic
sleep
i
am
sure
is
injurious
but
that
from
which
we
are
too
easily
roused
can
not
it
seems
to
me
be
less
so
thus
i
have
often
gone
to
sleep
with
a
resolution
to
wake
at
a
certain
hour
or
at
the
striking
of
the
clock
and
have
found
myself
able
to
wake
at
the
proposed
time
almost
without
one
failure
in
twenty
instances
where
i
have
made
the
trial
but
my
sleep
was
obviously
unsound
and
certainly
unsatisfying
the
desire
to
awake
at
a
certain
moment
or
period
seemed
to
buoy
me
above
the
usual
state
of
healthy
sleep
and
render
me
liable
to
awake
at
the
slightest
disturbance
were
it
not
for
sacrificing
the
ease
of
others
it
would
be
far
better
in
such
cases
to
rely
upon
some
person
to
wake
us
instead
of
charging
our
own
minds
with
it
the
quality
of
our
sleep
will
be
greatly
affected
by
the
quantity
but
this
thought
if
extended
would
anticipate
the
subject
of
our
next
section
so
easily
does
one
thing
especially
in
physical
education
run
into
or
involve
another
i
will
therefore
for
the
present
only
say
that
if
we
confine
ourselves
to
a
smaller
number
of
hours
than
is
really
required
our
sleep
becomes
too
sound
to
be
quite
healthy
as
if
nature
endeavored
to
make
up
in
quality
for
want
of
due
quantity
on
the
contrary
if
we
attempt
to
sleep
longer
than
is
really
necessary
to
restore
us
the
quality
of
our
sleep
is
not
what
it
ought
to
be
for
we
do
not
sleep
soundly
enough
the
silence
and
darkness
of
the
night
tend
to
induce
sleep
of
a
better
quality
than
the
noise
and
activity
of
day
it
is
unquestionably
desirable
that
children
should
be
able
to
sleep
at
least
occasionally
without
absolute
quiet
and
yet
such
sleep
can
not
be
sufficiently
sound
to
answer
the
purposes
of
health
if
frequently
repeated
hence
it
is
perhaps
at
least
in
part
that
the
maxim
has
obtained
currency
that
one
hour
of
sleep
before
midnight
is
worth
two
afterward
the
comparison
has
probably
been
made
between
the
quiet
and
darksome
hours
of
evening
and
those
which
followed
daybreak
when
light
and
music
and
bustle
conspire
as
they
should
to
make
us
wakeful
no
person
can
sleep
as
soundly
and
as
effectually
when
light
reaches
his
closed
eyes
and
sounds
strike
his
ears
as
in
darkness
and
silence
he
may
sleep
indeed
under
almost
any
circumstances
when
fatigue
and
exhaustion
demand
it
but
never
so
profoundly
as
when
in
absolute
abstraction
of
light
and
complete
quiet
sec
on
this
point
much
might
be
said
without
exhausting
the
subject
but
i
have
already
observed
that
infants
when
first
born
require
to
sleep
nearly
their
whole
time
as
they
advance
in
years
the
necessity
for
sleep
however
diminishes
until
they
come
to
maturity
when
it
remains
for
many
years
nearly
stationary
in
advanced
age
the
necessity
for
sleep
again
increases
till
we
reach
the
extremest
old
age
or
what
is
usually
called
second
childhood
when
we
again
sometimes
sleep
nearly
the
whole
time
i
have
already
remarked
that
much
might
be
said
on
this
subject
but
i
do
not
think
that
the
present
occasion
requires
it
if
the
suggestions
which
are
made
in
the
chapter
on
early
rising
should
receive
the
attention
i
flatter
myself
they
merit
i
do
not
believe
children
would
often
sleep
too
long
if
on
the
contrary
they
are
suffered
to
lie
late
in
the
morning
and
then
sit
up
late
in
the
evening
all
healthful
habits
and
tendencies
will
he
so
deranged
or
broken
up
that
nature
in
her
indications
will
by
no
means
prove
the
unerring
guide
which
she
is
wont
to
do
in
other
circumstances
a
few
thoughts
here
on
the
quantity
of
sleep
required
by
the
young
after
they
approach
maturity
may
not
be
misplaced
jeremy
taylor
thought
that
for
a
healthy
adult
three
hours
in
were
enough
for
all
the
purposes
of
sleep
baxter
thought
four
hours
about
a
reasonable
time
wesley
six
lord
coke
and
sir
wm
jones
seven
and
sir
john
sinclair
eight
these
were
the
of
men
who
were
all
eminent
for
their
learning
and
most
of
them
for
their
piety
how
far
their
corresponded
with
their
theories
we
are
not
in
every
instance
told
but
to
come
to
the
practice
of
several
persons
who
have
been
distinguished
in
the
world
general
elliot
one
of
the
most
vigorous
men
of
his
age
though
living
for
his
whole
life
on
nothing
but
vegetables
and
water
and
who
at
had
scarcely
begun
to
feel
the
infirmities
of
old
age
slept
but
four
hours
in
frederick
the
great
of
prussia
and
the
illustrious
british
surgeon
john
hunter
slept
but
five
hours
a
day
napoleon
bonaparte
for
a
great
part
of
his
life
slept
only
four
hours
and
lord
brougham
is
said
to
require
no
more
others
in
numerous
instances
require
but
six
hours
but
there
are
others
still
who
consume
eight
the
conclusion
in
my
own
mind
is
that
with
a
good
constitution
and
active
habits
men
may
habituate
themselves
to
very
different
quantities
of
sleep
still
i
think
that
six
hours
are
little
enough
for
most
persons
and
if
a
child
on
arriving
at
maturity
is
not
inclined
to
sleep
much
longer
than
that
i
should
not
regard
him
as
wasting
time
most
persons
it
appears
to
me
require
six
hours
of
sound
sleep
in
i
mean
between
the
ages
of
twenty
and
seventy
macnish
is
the
most
liberal
modern
writer
i
am
acquainted
with
in
his
allowance
of
time
for
sleep
speaking
of
the
wants
of
adults
he
says
no
person
who
passes
only
eight
hours
in
bed
can
be
said
to
waste
his
time
in
sleep
yet
he
obviously
contradicts
himself
on
the
very
same
page
for
he
says
expressly
that
when
a
person
is
young
strong
and
healthy
an
hour
or
two
less
may
be
sufficient
but
an
hour
or
two
less
than
eight
hours
reduces
the
amount
to
seven
or
six
hours
and
taking
the
whole
period
of
life
to
which
he
probably
refers
say
from
eighteen
to
forty
into
consideration
there
is
a
very
considerable
difference
between
six
hours
and
eight
hours
a
day
if
six
hours
are
sufficient
it
can
not
be
right
to
sleep
eight
hours
let
us
here
make
a
few
estimates
if
six
hours
are
sufficient
for
sleep
between
the
ages
of
eighteen
and
forty
he
who
sleeps
eight
hours
a
day
actually
loses
hours
equal
to
nearly
two
whole
years
of
life
or
about
two
years
and
three
quarters
of
time
in
which
we
are
usually
awake
this
in
the
meridian
of
life
is
not
a
small
waste
permit
it
to
every
person
now
in
the
united
states
and
the
sum
total
of
wasted
time
to
a
single
generation
would
be
years
equal
to
the
average
duration
of
the
lives
of
persons
the
value
of
this
time
as
a
commodity
in
the
market
at
a
low
estimate
only
forty
dollars
a
year
would
be
over
a
thousand
millions
of
dollars
and
its
value
for
the
purposes
of
mental
and
moral
improvement
can
not
be
estimated
except
in
eternity
every
young
mother
must
derive
from
these
considerations
a
motive
to
discourage
all
unnecessary
waste
of
time
in
sleep
while
no
one
as
i
trust
will
forget
that
to
sleep
too
little
is
also
dangerous
to
health
and
prejudicial
to
the
general
happiness

example
of

forbidding
children
to
rise

keeping
them
out
of
the
way
how
many
are
burnt
up
by
parental
neglect
lecturing
them
what
is
an
early
hour
some
writer
i
do
not
recollect
who
has
said
that
all
children
are
naturally
early
risers
and
i
can
not
help
coming
to
the
same
conclusion
that
they
are
not
so
is
no
more
proved
from
the
fact
that
as
things
now
are
they
are
generally
found
addicted
to
the
contrary
habit
than
the
very
general
neglect
of
milk
among
the
higher
classes
of
our
citizens
proves
that
they
have
not
a
natural
relish
for
it
when
every
one
knows
that
at
our
first
setting
out
in
life
milk
is
almost
without
exception
the
sole
article
of
human
sustenance
one
of
the
great
difficulties
in
the
way
of
early
rising
as
i
have
already
had
occasion
to
say
is
late
sitting
up
if
children
are
not
accustomed
to
retire
till
nine
or
ten
nor
then
until
they
have
been
subjected
to
all
the
excitements
pertaining
to
fashionable
life
company
heated
and
impure
air
stimulating
drink
fruits
food
and
perhaps
music
and
are
become
actually
feverish
no
one
but
an
ignorant
person
or
a
brute
ought
to
expect
them
to
rise
early
indeed
whatever
may
have
been
the
cause
and
whether
it
have
operated
on
high
or
low
life
late
retiring
will
inevitably
result
in
late
rising
the
current
may
be
turned
out
of
its
course
a
little
while
it
is
true
but
not
always
it
will
ere
long
return
to
its
accustomed
channel
perhaps
to
renew
its
course
with
increased
pertinacity
everything
in
the
morning
naturally
invites
to
early
rising
the
pleasant
light
the
music
at
certain
seasons
of
some
of
the
animated
tribes
and
the
joy
which
we
feel
in
activity
and
in
the
society
of
those
whom
we
love
all
conspire
to
rouse
us
if
we
have
retired
late
however
and
especially
in
a
feverish
condition
so
that
when
we
wake
we
feel
wretched
and
as
sometimes
happens
more
fatigued
than
when
we
lay
down
other
collateral
motives
may
be
needed
i
have
said
that
everything
invites
us
in
the
morning
to
rise
early
but
it
was
upon
the
presumption
that
our
parents
and
brothers
and
sisters
set
us
a
good
example
if
parents
and
other
friends
lie
in
bed
late
themselves
can
anything
else
be
expected
of
children
admitting
even
that
they
rise
early
themselves
if
they
never
speak
of
early
rising
as
a
pleasure
and
connect
along
with
it
in
their
minds
pleasant
associations
they
would
be
unreasonable
to
expect
otherwise
than
that
their
children
should
cling
to
the
morning
couch
till
they
are
fairly
compelled
to
rise
as
a
relief
from
pain
and
uneasiness
but
when
parents
go
farther
than
this
and
actually
discourage
their
children
from
rising
early
and
use
every
means
in
their
power
short
of
actual
punishment
and
sometimes
even
that
to
make
them
lie
still
till
breakfast
in
order
that
they
may
be
out
of
the
way
what
shall
we
say
and
what
is
to
be
expected
as
the
result
there
is
hope
however
under
the
last
circumstances
people
sometimes
carry
things
to
an
extreme
that
defeats
their
very
purposes
thus
it
occasionally
is
in
the
case
before
us
this
forbidding
children
to
rise
early
and
threatening
them
if
they
do
sometimes
excites
their
curiosity
and
leads
them
to
the
forbidden
course
of
conduct
simply
it
is
forbidden
not
a
few
persons
among
us
possess
the
disposition
to
be
governed
by
what
has
sometimes
been
called
the
rule
of
contrary
i
might
stop
here
to
show
that
there
is
nothing
so
well
calculated
to
develope
and
improve
the
mind
and
heart
even
of
parents
themselves
as
the
society
of
those
whom
god
gives
them
to
train
for
him
and
their
country
i
might
show
that
not
a
few
of
those
traits
of
character
which
render
the
company
of
many
old
persons
rather
irksome
especially
to
the
young
have
their
origin
in
their
neglect
of
the
young
and
of
keeping
up
as
long
as
circumstances
will
possibly
admit
juvenile
feelings
actions
and
habits
and
yet
what
do
we
too
often
witness
in
life
is
not
every
effort
made
to
induce
the
young
to
lie
in
bed
late
that
they
may
be
out
of
the
way
are
they
not
placed
as
soon
as
possible
after
they
are
up
with
the
servants
if
unfortunately
there
are
any
in
the
family
that
they
may
be
out
of
the
way
are
they
not
required
to
breakfast
and
dine
and
sup
elsewhere
if
possible
that
they
may
be
out
of
the
way
do
we
not
send
them
to
school
even
the
sabbath
school
to
get
them
out
of
the
way
do
not
some
mothers
even
dose
their
infants
with
stupifying
medicines
to
lull
them
to
sleep
in
order
to
have
them
out
of
the
way
and
to
crown
all
though
they
are
quite
too
often
permitted
to
sit
up
late
in
the
evening
to
enjoy
that
society
which
they
are
denied
so
great
a
part
of
the
are
they
not
occasionally
put
to
bed
early
that
they
may
be
out
of
the
way
and
that
the
parents
may
attend
late
parties
to
indulge
in
immoral
or
unhealthy
habits
in
the
last
instance
they
are
indeed
sometimes
put
out
of
the
way
in
the
result
and
with
a
vengeance
many
a
child
nay
many
thousands
of
children
are
burnt
up
yearly
while
their
parents
are
gone
abroad
in
the
evening
in
quest
of
that
enjoyment
which
ought
to
be
found
in
the
bosom
of
their
families
in
westminster
a
part
of
london
containing
less
than
two
hundred
thousand
inhabitants
one
hundred
children
were
thus
destroyed
during
a
single
year
and
the
moral
results
which
occasionally
happen
are
a
thousand
times
worse
than
burning
but
enough
of
this
the
common
practice
of
lecturing
the
young
on
the
importance
of
early
rising
may
have
a
good
effect
on
a
few
but
in
general
it
is
believed
to
produce
the
contrary
result
it
is
in
short
to
sum
up
the
whole
matter
the
influence
of
parental
example
and
the
speaking
often
of
the
happiness
which
early
rising
affords
with
perhaps
the
occasional
indulgence
of
the
child
in
a
pleasant
morning
walk
which
if
he
retires
early
enough
are
almost
certain
to
produce
in
him
the
valuable
habit
of
early
rising
but
what
is
an
early
hour
some
call
it
early
when
the
sun
is
one
hour
high
some
at
sunrise
others
when
they
hear
of
an
early
riser
suppose
he
must
be
one
who
rises
at
least
by
daybreak
midnight
is
of
course
as
near
the
middle
of
the
night
as
any
hour
and
he
who
goes
to
bed
four
or
five
hours
before
midnight
will
never
complain
of
those
who
insist
that
is
not
an
early
riser
who
is
not
up
by
four
or
five
in
summer
no
adult
ought
to
lie
in
bed
after
four
and
no
child
except
the
mere
infant
after
five
much
is
said
by
a
few
writers
especially
macnish
of
the
danger
of
rising
before
the
sun
has
attained
a
sufficient
height
above
the
horizon
to
chase
away
the
vapors
and
remove
the
dampness
but
i
must
insist
upon
earlier
rising
than
this
though
we
should
not
choose
to
venture
abroad
invigorated
and
restored
as
we
are
by
sleep
i
can
not
think
that
the
dampness
of
the
morning
air
is
more
injurious
than
the
foul
air
of
some
of
our
sleeping
rooms

mistakes
about
hardening
children

clothing

the
scotch
highlanders
the
two
extremes
equally
fatal
and
neglect
an
interesting
anecdote
from
dewees
while
i
have
been
very
particular
in
enjoining
on
my
readers
the
importance
of
thoroughly
ventilating
their
dwellings
i
have
also
insisted
upon
the
necessity
of
taking
children
abroad
as
much
as
possible
not
however
to
harden
them
so
much
as
to
give
them
a
more
free
access
to
air
and
light
than
they
can
have
at
home
and
also
when
they
are
old
enough
to
cultivate
the
faculties
of
attention
comparison
the
practice
of
attempting
to
harden
children
by
frequent
exposure
to
air
much
colder
than
that
to
which
they
have
been
accustomed
without
sufficient
additional
clothing
is
open
to
the
same
objections
which
have
been
brought
against
cold
bathing
under
the
management
of
a
judicious
medical
practitioner
it
may
do
great
good
to
a
few
constitutions
but
its
indiscriminate
use
would
injure
a
thousand
infants
for
one
who
was
benefited
true
it
is
that
if
the
child
is
protected
against
cold
no
harm
but
on
the
contrary
much
good
may
result
from
carrying
him
abroad
into
the
fresh
air
even
in
very
cold
weather
but
what
can
be
more
painful
than
to
see
the
little
sufferers
carried
along
when
their
limbs
are
purple
or
benumbed
with
cold
and
how
idle
it
is
to
hope
that
such
exposure
hardens
or
improves
the
constitution
it
is
on
the
same
mistaken
principle
that
many
adults
go
thinly
clad
late
in
the
fall
i
have
seen
men
in
november
and
december
beating
and
rubbing
their
hands
who
on
being
asked
why
they
did
not
wear
mittens
replied
that
if
they
should
wear
one
pair
of
mittens
so
early
in
the
season
they
should
want
two
in
the
winter
now
i
cheerfully
admit
that
to
put
on
additional
clothing
before
the
severity
of
the
weather
demands
it
actually
produces
the
effect
here
supposed
but
to
endure
severe
cold
on
the
contrary
never
hardens
anybody
nay
more
it
enfeebles
cold
when
combined
with
the
evils
of
produces
more
mischief
and
destroys
more
lives
than
any
one
disease
in
the
whole
catalogue
of
human
maladies
adam
smith
says
that
it
is
not
uncommon
for
mothers
in
the
highlands
of
scotland
who
have
borne
twenty
children
to
have
only
two
of
them
alive
it
may
be
difficult
to
say
whether
children
are
oftener
destroyed
by
than
by
neglect
and
the
evils
incident
to
poverty
both
extremes
are
common
while
the
happy
medium
that
of
conducting
a
child
education
upon
the
principles
of
physiology
is
rarely
known
and
still
more
rarely
followed
i
have
been
much
amused
and
not
a
little
instructed
by
the
following
anecdote
on
this
point
from
dewees
we
were
speaking
with
a
lady
who
had
lost
three
or
four
children
with
croup
who
informed
us
she
was
convinced
from
absolute
experiment
that
there
was
nothing
like
exposure
to
all
kinds
of
weather
to
protect
and
harden
the
system
by
her
first
plan
of
managing
her
children
which
was
by
keeping
them
very
warmly
clad
she
said
she
lost
several
by
the
croup
but
since
she
had
adopted
the
opposite
scheme
her
children
had
been
perfectly
healthy
and
never
had
betrayed
the
slightest
disposition
to
that
terrible
disease
which
had
robbed
her
of
her
children
perhaps
madam
we
observed
you
did
not
in
making
your
first
experiments
attend
to
a
number
of
details
which
might
be
thought
essential
to
the
plan
you
did
not
probably
take
the
proper
precautions
when
you
sent
them
into
the
cold
air
or
observe
what
was
important
for
them
when
they
returned
from
it
oh
yes
she
replied
i
took
every
possible
care
when
they
were
going
out
i
always
made
them
wear
a
very
warm
great
coat
well
lined
with
baize
and
a
fur
cape
or
collar
i
always
made
them
wear
a
round
their
necks
made
of
soft
woollen
yarn
and
as
for
their
feet
they
were
always
protected
by
socks
or
lined
with
wool
or
fur
as
the
weather
might
be
wet
or
dry
do
you
believe
madam
they
were
kept
at
a
proper
degree
of
warmth
by
these
means
oh
certainly
indeed
rather
too
warm
for
they
would
often
be
in
a
state
of
perspiration
they
told
me
when
in
the
open
air
especially
if
they
ran
slid
or
skated
and
what
was
done
when
they
were
thus
heated
oh
they
got
cool
enough
before
they
reached
home
and
would
they
receive
no
injury
in
passing
from
this
state
of
perspiration
to
that
of
chill
not
at
all
for
when
this
happened
i
always
made
them
take
a
little
warm
brandy
or
wine
and
water
and
made
them
toast
their
feet
well
by
the
fire
footnote
this
absurd
custom
is
a
fruitful
source
of
that
distressing
condition
of
the
hands
and
feet
in
winter
called
chilblains
did
they
sleep
in
a
cold
or
warm
room
in
a
warm
room
a
good
fire
was
always
made
in
the
stove
before
they
went
to
bed
which
kept
them
quite
warm
all
night
would
they
never
complain
of
being
cold
towards
morning
when
the
stove
had
become
cold
yes
certainly
but
then
there
were
always
at
hand
additional
with
which
they
could
cover
themselves
and
did
they
always
do
it
oh
i
suppose
so
well
madam
how
did
you
carry
your
second
plan
into
execution
which
you
say
was
attended
with
such
happy
results
i
began
by
not
letting
them
put
on
their
great
coats
except
when
the
weather
was
so
cold
as
to
require
this
additional
covering
and
did
not
permit
them
to
wear
a
or
fur
round
their
necks
i
took
away
their
and
if
their
feet
chanced
to
get
wet
for
they
were
always
provided
with
good
sound
shoes
the
shoes
were
immediately
changed
if
they
were
at
home
if
the
weather
was
wet
or
unusually
cold
they
were
permitted
to
wear
their
great
coats
but
not
without
if
they
came
home
very
cold
they
were
not
allowed
to
approach
the
fire
too
soon
i
gave
them
no
warm
heating
drinks
and
accustomed
them
to
sleep
in
rooms
without
fire
who
does
not
recognize
in
this
second
plan
for
the
enjoyment
of
air
and
exercise
as
judicious
a
plan
of
physical
education
so
far
as
it
goes
as
can
well
be
pointed
out
we
were
so
successful
as
to
convince
this
lady
in
a
very
short
time
that
our
own
plan
of
exposing
the
body
was
precisely
the
one
she
had
pursued
with
so
much
success
we
also
inquired
of
her
what
plan
she
pursued
with
her
children
when
too
young
to
be
submitted
to
the
rules
just
mentioned
she
informed
us
that
it
was
the
same
system
throughout
only
the
details
varied
as
circumstances
of
age
made
it
necessary
that
is
she
sent
her
children
into
the
open
air
at
very
early
periods
of
their
lives
provided
in
summer
it
was
neither
too
wet
nor
too
warm
in
winter
when
the
air
was
mild
dry
and
clear
but
always
carefully
wrapped
up
that
their
little
extremities
might
not
suffer
from
cold
she
never
suffered
them
to
sleep
in
the
open
air
if
it
could
be
avoided
to
prevent
which
as
much
as
possible
she
constantly
charged
the
nurse
to
bring
the
children
home
as
soon
as
she
found
them
disposed
to
sleep
unless
it
was
when
they
were
very
young
at
which
time
it
was
impossible
to
guard
against
it
and
when
her
children
were
sufficiently
old
to
walk
she
took
care
to
prepare
them
properly
for
it
whether
it
might
be
in
warm
cold
or
moderate
weather
she
never
sent
them
abroad
for
pleasure
at
the
risk
of
encountering
a
storm
of
any
kind
nor
permitted
them
to
walk
at
the
hazard
of
getting
wet
or
very
muddy
feet
were
the
constitutions
of
your
children
pretty
much
the
same
we
demanded
of
this
lady
no
one
of
my
boys
was
extremely
feeble
from
his
very
birth
did
you
treat
him
precisely
as
you
did
the
others
yes
as
far
as
regarded
principles
that
is
i
permitted
him
to
bear
as
much
of
cold
heat
or
wet
as
his
constitution
would
endure
without
pain
or
injury
the
degrees
however
were
very
different
from
those
his
brothers
bore
had
they
been
determined
by
the
measurement
of
the
thermometer
but
precisely
the
same
in
effect
as
far
as
could
be
ascertained
by
consequences
thus
if
he
were
exposed
to
the
same
temperature
as
his
brothers
he
experienced
no
more
inconvenience
from
it
when
it
was
very
low
than
they
because
he
had
additional
covering
to
protect
him

every

is
unquestionably

to
the
society
of
her
child
as
to
his
food

and
if
the
quality

and

character
of
the
latter
are
important
those
of
the
former
are
by
no
means
less
so
it
is
indeed
true
that
many
a
child
has
been
happy
in
a
degree
in
the
society
of
its
mother
alone
where
the
father
was
seldom
seen
and
the
brothers
and
sisters
never
and
it
is
equally
true
that
a
few
children
have
so
far
preferred
the
society
of
their
parents
alone
as
to
become
disinclined
to
other
society
but
cases
of
this
kind
are
only
as
exceptions
to
the
general
rule
and
are
probably
monstrous
formations
of
character
i
can
not
believe
that
any
child
rightly
educated
would
prefer
the
society
of
none
but
its
parents
or
even
its
parents
and
brothers
and
sisters
a
french
author
has
written
a
considerable
volume
on
the
importance
of
what
he
calls
but
which
he
should
prefer
to
call
cheerfulness
among
the
rest
he
maintains
that
it
is
indispensable
to
the
best
health
but
if
so
and
i
do
not
doubt
it
then
it
ought
to
be
encouraged
in
children
and
the
earlier
the
better
now
there
is
no
way
to
encourage
cheerfulness
in
the
young
so
effectually
as
by
indulging
them
with
considerable
society
that
the
thing
may
be
carried
to
excess
i
have
no
doubt
i
have
seen
mothers
who
permitted
their
children
to
play
with
their
mates
till
they
became
excited
and
were
thus
led
to
continue
their
sports
not
only
farther
than
cheerfulness
and
health
demanded
but
until
they
were
excessively
fatigued
and
almost
made
sick
and
i
believe
that
the
excitement
of
numbers
in
infant
and
other
schools
may
be
so
great
as
to
be
injurious
rather
than
salutary
still
i
think
these
are
rare
cases
truth
usually
lies
somewhere
between
extremes
to
keep
a
child
especially
a
boy
always
in
the
nursery
or
even
in
the
parlor
with
his
mother
is
one
extreme
and
to
let
him
go
abroad
continually
till
his
home
and
its
smaller
circle
become
insipid
is
the
other
a
child
properly
trained
will
prefer
home
and
only
desire
to
go
abroad
occasionally
he
will
rather
need
urging
in
the
matter
than
require
restraint
but
he
must
at
any
rate
be
taught
to
be
sociable
not
only
for
the
salve
of
cheerfulness
and
the
consequent
health
but
for
the
sake
of
his
manners
his
mind
and
his
morals
if
it
is
a
matter
of
indifference
in
the
formation
of
human
character
whether
we
mix
in
society
or
not
then
for
anything
i
can
see
an
improvement
might
be
proposed
in
the
construction
of
the
material
universe
instead
of
forming
the
planets
so
large
and
this
earth
among
the
rest
each
might
have
been
divided
into
hundreds
of
millions
and
every
human
being
might
have
had
a
little
planet
and
an
immortality
exclusively
his
own
such
an
arrangement
would
certainly
prevent
a
great
many
evils
and
among
the
rest
a
great
deal
of
quarrelling
and
bloodshed
but
divine
wisdom
is
higher
than
human
wisdom
and
one
world
to
hundreds
of
millions
of
human
beings
has
been
made
instead
of
giving
to
each
individual
of
the
universe
a
little
world
of
his
own
in
which
he
might
have
reigned
sole
monarch
and
only
wept
with
alexander
because
none
of
the
other
worlds
were
within
his
grasp
where
a
family
is
already
large
other
society
will
be
unnecessary
for
some
time
but
where
it
consists
of
a
mother
only
although
her
society
is
always
to
be
considered
of
the
importance
i
can
not
but
think
she
ought
to
take
great
pains
to
introduce
her
child
occasionally
to
the
company
of
other
children
that
diffidence
which
almost
destroys
the
influence
and
the
happiness
of
many
individuals
is
often
cherished
if
not
created
by
too
much
seclusion
where
there
is
a
natural
constitution
which
predisposes
the
child
to
timidity
and
diffidence
the
danger
is
greatly
increased
and
parents
should
take
unwearied
pains
to
guard
against
it
it
is
hardly
necessary
for
me
to
say
that
great
care
should
also
be
used
in
selecting
the
companions
of
children
their
character
will
be
greatly
influenced
for
life
by
their
earlier
associates
friendships
between
children
are
sometimes
formed
while
playing
together
which
are
interrupted
only
by
death
those
parents
who
are
so
fond
of
controlling
the
choice
of
their
sons
and
daughters
in
regard
to
a
companion
for
life
at
a
period
when
control
is
generally
resisted
would
do
well
to
take
a
hint
from
what
has
here
been
suggested
there
is
no
doubt
but
they
might
often
very
often
give
such
a
direction
to
the
embryo
affections
of
their
infants
and
children
as
would
terminate
only
with
their
existence
it
is
still
less
necessary
to
advert
in
a
work
like
this
to
the
effect
which
much
observation
and
experience
shows
good
society
to
have
on
purity
both
physical
and
moral
every
one
must
have
observed
its
tendency
to
form
habits
of
cleanliness
not
to
say
neatness
there
may
be
excess
even
in
this
young
persons
of
both
sexes
often
spend
too
much
time
in
preparing
their
dress
for
the
reception
or
the
visiting
of
their
friends
still
this
is
only
the
abuse
of
a
good
thing
nor
is
it
less
true
though
it
may
be
less
obvious
that
moral
purity
is
more
likely
to
be
secured
where
children
and
youth
of
both
sexes
associate
a
great
deal
from
the
earliest
infancy
footnote
if
this
principle
be
correct
what
is
the
tendency
of
our
numerous
schools
which
are
exclusively
for
one
sex
must
there
not
be
latent
evil
to
counterbalance
some
of
the
seeming
good
for
myself
i
doubt
whether
moral
character
can
ever
be
formed
in
due
proportion
and
harmony
where
this
separation
long
exists
there
are
tremendous
cases
of
declension
on
record
which
establish
this
point
beyond
the
possibility
of
debate
to
say
that
the
mother
and
indeed
both
parents
ought
to
form
a
part
of
the
playing
circle
of
the
youngest
children
in
order
to
watch
their
opening
dispositions
to
check
what
may
be
improper
and
encourage
what
ought
to
be
encouraged
would
be
only
to
repeat
what
has
often
been
recommended
by
the
best
writers
on
education
but
which
must
be
repeated
again
and
again
till
it
leaves
an
impression
especially
on
christian
parents
it
is
strange
that
many
regard
this
matter
as
they
do
and
appear
not
only
ashamed
to
be
seen
sporting
with
their
children
but
almost
ashamed
to
have
their
children
thus
occupied
they
might
as
well
be
ashamed
of
the
gambols
of
the
kitten
or
the
lamb
or
of
the
grave
mother
as
she
turns
aside
occasionally
to
join
in
its
frolics
when
will
parents
be
willing
to
take
lessons
in
education
from
that
brute
world
which
they
have
been
so
long
accustomed
to
overlook

opinion
one
important
and
employment
of

is
the
cultivation
of
their
minds
and
another
that
of
their
morals
but
my
present
purpose
is
only
to
speak
of
those
employments
denominated
manual
or
physical
it
is
obvious
at
the
first
glance
that
the
influence
of
the
mother
in
our
own
country
at
least
will
be
less
over
boys
than
over
girls
we
leave
it
to
savages
and
to
employ
their
females
and
even
their
mothers
in
hard
manual
labor
here
in
america
what
i
should
say
on
the
employment
of
boys
would
be
more
properly
addressed
to
the
young
father
there
are
some
exceptions
to
the
general
truth
contained
in
the
last
paragraph
many
a
mother
has
unconsciously
at
the
time
but
with
no
less
certainty
than
if
she
had
done
it
intentionally
given
a
direction
to
the
whole
current
of
her
son
life
and
this
too
at
a
very
early
period
the
mother
of
benjamin
west
the
painter
if
she
did
not
give
the
first
tendency
to
his
favorite
pursuit
while
he
was
yet
a
mere
child
at
the
least
greatly
confirmed
him
in
it
by
the
manner
of
expressing
her
surprise
at
one
of
his
early
performances
my
kiss
on
that
occasion
said
he
made
me
a
painter
nor
are
facts
of
the
same
general
character
by
any
means
uncommon
i
know
a
poor
mother
who
in
the
absence
of
her
husband
at
his
weekly
or
monthly
labors
used
to
detain
her
eldest
boy
then
almost
an
infant
from
going
to
bed
in
the
evening
till
her
day
work
was
finished
because
in
her
loneliness
she
wanted
his
company
by
telling
stories
of
eminent
men
and
especially
of
distinguished
philanthropists
until
she
had
unconsciously
kindled
in
him
a
philanthropic
spirit
which
will
not
cease
to
burn
till
his
death
but
it
is
in
forming
the
predilections
of
daughters
for
their
destined
employments
that
mothers
are
especially
influential
not
so
much
by
their
set
lessons
or
lectures
however
as
by
the
force
of
continued
example
no
mother
who
sends
her
child
away
to
be
nursed
and
subsequently
to
her
return
seizes
on
every
possible
opportunity
to
keep
her
out
of
the
way
and
out
of
her
sight
will
be
likely
to
give
her
any
choice
of
employment
or
indeed
any
fondness
for
employment
at
all
nor
is
it
sufficient
that
she
keep
her
daughter
constantly
under
her
eye
with
a
view
to
qualify
her
for
the
duties
of
a
housewife
if
the
daughter
see
as
plainly
as
in
the
light
of
that
the
mother
dislikes
the
employment
herself
she
must
love
what
she
would
have
her
daughter
love
and
even
what
she
would
have
her
understand
nor
is
it
sufficient
that
she
a
fondness
for
the
employment
her
love
for
it
must
be
real
little
girls
have
keener
eyes
and
better
judgments
than
some
mothers
seem
willing
to
believe
or
to
admit
many
persons
seem
greatly
surprised
that
the
young
ladies
of
modern
days
have
so
little
fondness
for
domestic
life
and
domestic
duties
how
few
it
is
often
said
will
do
their
own
housework
if
they
can
possibly
get
a
train
of
domestics
around
them
even
though
the
care
and
oversight
of
the
domestics
themselves
gear
them
out
more
rapidly
than
bodily
labor
would
but
there
is
a
reason
for
this
hostility
to
domestic
employments
it
is
because
mothers
almost
universally
consider
their
occupations
as
mere
drudgery
and
bring
up
their
children
in
the
same
spirit
and
what
else
could
be
expected
as
the
result
it
would
be
an
anomaly
in
the
history
of
human
nature
if
the
female
members
of
families
were
to
grow
up
in
love
with
ordinary
domestic
avocations
when
they
have
been
accustomed
to
see
their
mothers
and
nurses
and
elder
sisters
complaining
and
fretting
while
engaged
in
them
and
showing
by
their
actions
no
less
than
by
their
words
that
they
regarded
themselves
as
miserable
and
wretched
no
wonder
so
many
girls
of
the
present
day
make
miserable
housewives
no
wonder
a
factory
a
or
a
shoemaker
shop
is
considered
preferable
to
the
kitchen
no
wonder
the
world
degenerates
because
females
no
longer
healthfully
employed
become
pale
and
sickly
spreading
gloom
and
misery
all
around
them
and
transmitting
the
same
ills
which
themselves
suffer
to
those
who
come
after
them
it
is
true
the
guilt
of
this
dereliction
must
not
be
charged
wholly
on
mothers
though
they
ought
unquestionably
to
bear
a
large
share
of
it
those
who
have
and
ought
to
have
much
influence
in
society
erroneously
and
i
suppose
thoughtlessly
help
mothers
along
in
their
evil
ways
if
there
were
a
universal
combination
between
certain
classes
of
mankind
and
the
whole
race
of
mothers
to
ruin
rather
than
be
instrumental
of
reforming
mankind
and
of
saving
their
deathless
souls
i
hardly
know
how
they
could
invent
a
much
better
or
at
least
a
much
more
certain
plan
than
that
now
in
operation
so
long
as
those
who
take
the
lead
in
society
and
govern
the
fashion
in
this
matter
as
others
govern
it
in
the
matter
of
dress
refuse
as
a
general
rule
to
form
alliances
for
life
except
with
those
who
practically
despise
concerns
and
so
long
as
our
houses
are
filled
with
domestics
whose
object
is
to
aid
these
spoiled
mothers
but
whose
real
effect
is
to
complete
their
ruin
and
accelerate
the
ruin
of
mankind
just
so
long
will
human
progress
towards
perfection
be
retarded
if
mothers
were
in
love
with
their
occupations
and
their
daughters
knew
it
then
to
the
influence
of
a
good
example
they
could
add
many
lessons
of
instruction
these
might
be
given
in
the
way
of
natural
unstudied
conversation
and
thus
be
not
only
heard
with
attention
but
sink
deep
if
the
world
is
ever
to
be
reformed

woman
sensible
enlightened

must
be
the
original

in
the
great
work
every
one
who
has
considered
well
the
extent
and
nature
of
female
influence
will
concur
in
the
sentiment
and
if
he
have
one
remaining
particle
of
devotion
to
the
father
of
spirits
he
will
send
up
the
most
fervent
petitions
to
his
throne
of
mercy
in
behalf
of
this
often
depressed
or
enslaved
half
of
the
human
race
that
they
may
speedily
be
emancipated
and
become
as
conspicuous
in
human
redemption
as
they
have

education
of

man
is
much
less
useful
and
happy
in
this
world
than
he
would
be
if
more
pains
were
taken
by
parents
and
teachers
as
well
as
by
himself
to
cultivate
his
senses
hearing
seeing
feeling
tasting
and
smelling
and
to
preserve
their
rectitude
the
extent
to
which
the
senses
can
be
improved
or
exalted
can
best
be
understood
by
observing
how
perfect
they
become
when
we
are
compelled
to
cultivate
them
thus
the
blind
who
are
obliged
to
cultivate
hearing
feeling
and
smelling
often
astonish
us
by
the
keenness
of
these
senses
they
will
distinguish
sounds
especially
voices
which
others
can
not
and
with
so
much
accuracy
as
to
remember
for
several
years
the
voice
of
a
person
in
a
large
company
which
they
hear
but
once
they
will
also
distinguish
small
pieces
of
money
different
fabrics
and
qualities
of
cloth
and
in
walking
often
ascertain
by
the
feeling
of
the
air
or
by
other
sensations
when
they
approach
a
building
or
any
other
considerable
body
so
the
north
american
indian
whose
habits
of
life
seem
to
require
it
can
hear
the
footsteps
of
an
approaching
enemy
at
distances
which
astonish
us
so
also
the
deaf
and
dumb
are
very
and
generally
make
very
accurate
observations
any
reader
who
is
sceptical
in
regard
to
the
cultivation
of
the
senses
would
do
well
to
consult
the
account
of
julia
brace
the
deaf
and
dumb
and
blind
girl
as
published
in
some
of
the
early
volumes
of
the
annals
of
education
but
it
is
hardly
necessary
to
resort
to
the
blind
or
to
savages
or
to
the
deaf
and
dumb
in
order
to
prove
man
susceptibility
in
this
respect
we
may
be
reminded
of
the
same
fact
by
observing
with
what
accuracy
the
merchant
tailor
can
distinguish
by
feeling
the
quality
of
his
goods
how
quick
a
painter
an
engraver
or
a
printer
will
discover
errors
in
painting
or
printing
which
wholly
escape
ordinary
readers
or
observers
and
how
quick
the
ear
of
a
good
musician
will
discover
the
existence
and
origin
of
a
discordant
sound
in
his
choir
now
i
do
not
undertake
to
say
or
prove
that
mankind
would
be
better
or
happier
for
having
their
senses
all
cultivated
in
the
highest
possible
degree
though
i
am
not
sure
that
this
would
not
be
the
case
but
so
long
as
a
large
proportion
of
our
ideas
enter
our
minds
through
the
medium
of
the
five
senses
it
is
desirable
that
something
should
be
done
to
perfect
them
instead
of
overlooking
the
whole
subject
what
mothers
ought
to
do
in
this
matter
deserves
therefore
a
brief
consideration
sec
the
suggestion
in
another
place
to
keep
away
caps
from
the
head
if
duly
attended
to
is
one
means
of
perfecting
or
at
least
of
preserving
the
sense
of
hearing
for
caps
by
the
heat
they
produce
to
a
part
which
can
not
safely
endure
an
increase
of
temperature
greatly
expose
children
to
catarrhal
affections
and
many
a
catarrh
has
laid
the
foundation
for
dulness
of
hearing
if
not
of
actual
deafness
the
ears
should
be
kept
clean
if
washed
sufficiently
often
and
syringed
once
a
week
with
warm
milk
and
water
or
with
very
weak
gently
warmed
the
cerumen
or
ear
wax
will
hardly
be
found
accumulated
in
such
masses
as
to
produce
deafness
and
yet
such
accumulations
with
such
consequences
are
by
no
means
uncommon
it
is
not
long
since
a
young
man
with
whom
i
am
acquainted
applied
to
an
eminent
surgeon
of
boston
on
account
of
deafness
in
one
ear
which
had
become
quite
troublesome
and
as
it
was
feared
incurable
syringing
with
a
large
and
strong
syringe
disengaged
a
large
mass
of
cerumen
and
hearing
was
immediately
restored
children
should
be
taught
to
distinguish
sounds
with
closed
eyes
or
blindfolded
we
may
strike
on
various
objects
and
ask
them
to
tell
what
we
struck
this
will
lead
them
to
sounds
and
will
perfect
their
hearing
in
a
remarkable
degree
there
are
also
advantages
to
be
derived
from
accustoming
a
child
to
a
great
variety
of
sounds
both
as
regards
their
strength
and
character
but
this
must
only
be
occasional
for
if
the
ear
be
constantly
accustomed
to
sounds
of
any
kind
and
more
especially
those
which
are
harsh
or
loud
the
organ
of
hearing
is
liable
to
sustain
injury
music
as
it
is
now
beginning
to
be
taught
to
children
in
our
schools
will
do
much
i
think
to
improve
the
faculty
of
hearing
sec
the
sight
says
addison
is
the
most
perfect
of
all
our
senses
and
this
is
unquestionably
true
but
it
is
more
or
less
perfect
in
different
individuals
according
to
the
early
education
they
have
received
sometimes
it
is
true
we
are
born
but
such
cases
are
comparatively
rare
the
question
is
sometimes
asked
why
there
are
so
many
persons
who
lose
their
sight
become
very
young
it
may
be
difficult
to
answer
this
question
fully
yet
i
can
not
help
thinking
that
the
following
are
some
of
the
causes
the
great
heat
of
our
apartments
which
together
with
late
hours
and
much
lamp
light
affects
the
eyes
unpleasantly
is
believed
to
be
among
the
more
prominent
causes
of
early
decay
of
sight
formerly
our
apartments
were
neither
so
steadily
nor
so
generally
heated
and
we
rose
earlier
and
consequently
went
to
bed
earlier
the
fine
print
of
a
large
proportion
of
our
books
especially
our
school
books
has
done
immense
injury
i
do
not
believe
that
reading
fine
print
occasionally
for
a
few
moments
at
a
time
or
reading
by
a
very
strong
or
very
weak
light
in
the
same
way
does
harm
on
the
contrary
i
think
it
may
strengthen
and
improve
the
sight
it
is
the
long
continuance
of
these
things
that
does
the
mischief
and
the
mischief
thus
done
is
immense
i
rejoice
that
printers
and
publishers
are
beginning
of
late
to
use
much
larger
type
than
they
have
done
for
some
years
past
the
early
use
of
spectacles
does
mischief
i
mean
before
they
are
needed
after
they
begin
to
be
needed
there
is
no
advantage
in
delaying
to
use
them
as
some
do
for
fear
they
shall
wear
them
too
soon
this
is
about
as
wise
as
the
practice
of
going
cold
to
harden
ourselves
reading
when
we
are
fatigued
or
ill
or
have
a
very
full
stomach
is
another
way
to
injure
the
sight
rubbing
the
eyes
with
the
fingers
or
with
anything
else
does
inevitable
mischief
the
germans
have
a
proverb
which
says
never
touch
your
eye
except
with
your
elbow
there
is
much
of
good
sense
in
it
in
short
there
are
a
thousand
ways
in
which
that
delicate
organ
the
human
eye
may
sustain
injury
and
nearly
as
many
in
which
it
may
be
strengthened
cultivated
and
improved
but
my
limits
merely
permit
me
to
add
that
the
frequent
but
gentle
application
of
water
to
the
eye
several
times
a
day
at
such
a
temperature
as
is
most
agreeable
but
cold
when
it
can
be
borne
is
one
of
the
best
preservatives
of
sight
which
the
world
affords
connected
alike
with
physical
and
intellectual
education
is
the
practice
of
measuring
by
the
eye
heights
distances
superfices
weights
and
solids
it
is
not
difficult
to
train
the
eye
to
an
accuracy
in
this
matter
which
would
astonish
the
uninstructed
sec
and
i
do
not
know
that
it
is
worth
our
while
to
take
pains
by
any
direct
methods
to
cultivate
the
organs
of
taste
or
smell
but
i
think
it
proper
at
the
least
to
preserve
their
original
rectitude
many
i
know
undertake
to
say
that
were
it
not
for
our
errors
in
regard
to
food
and
drink
and
were
it
not
in
particular
for
the
multitude
of
strange
mixtures
which
tend
to
benumb
those
two
senses
we
might
determine
the
qualities
of
food
and
drink
whether
they
are
favorable
or
adverse
by
means
of
taste
and
smell
like
the
animals
but
i
do
not
believe
this
the
creator
has
substituted
reason
in
us
for
instinct
in
the
brute
animals
it
is
not
necessary
that
we
should
possess
the
latter
when
the
former
is
so
manifestly
superior
to
it
and
accordingly
i
do
not
believe
that
it
is
given
us
or
any
of
that
acuteness
of
sensation
which
exists
in
the
dog
the
tiger
the
vulture
and
which
so
closely
resembles
it
there
can
be
no
doubt
no
reasonable
doubt
certainly
that
the
wretched
customs
of
modern
cookery
benumb
the
senses
of
taste
and
smell
more
or
less
and
that
food
condiments
and
stimulating
drinks
do
the
same
and
should
for
this
reason
were
it
for
no
other
be
studiously
avoided
closely
connected
with
the
organ
of
taste
are
the
teeth
a
volume
might
profitably
be
written
on
these
as
on
the
eye
but
i
will
only
say
that
they
should
be
kept
perfectly
clean
either
by
rinsing
or
brushing
or
both
especially
after
eating
that
they
should
be
permitted
to
chew
all
our
food
instead
of
merely
standing
by
as
silent
spectators
to
the
passage
of
that
which
is
mashed
soaked
chopped
that
they
should
not
be
picked
or
cleaned
with
pins
or
other
equally
hard
instruments
that
they
should
not
be
used
to
crack
nuts
or
other
hard
indigestible
substances
and
that
the
stomach
with
which
they
are
apt
to
sympathize
very
strongly
should
also
be
kept
in
a
good
and
healthy
condition
sec
corpulence
and
slovenliness
are
generally
among
the
more
prolific
sources
of
a
want
of
acuteness
in
feeling
the
first
is
a
disease
and
may
be
avoided
by
a
proper
diet
and
by
active
mental
and
bodily
employment
slovenliness
we
may
of
course
avoid
whenever
there
is
a
wish
to
do
so
and
an
abundance
of
water
but
the
sense
of
feeling
or
especially
that
accumulation
of
it
which
we
call
touch
and
which
seems
to
be
specially
located
in
the
balls
of
the
fingers
and
on
the
palm
of
the
hand
is
susceptible
of
a
degree
of
improvement
far
beyond
what
would
be
the
natural
result
of
cleanliness
and
freedom
from
plethora
or
corpulence
i
have
already
alluded
in
my
general
remarks
at
the
head
of
this
chapter
to
the
acuteness
of
this
sense
in
the
blind
as
well
as
in
the
dealer
in
cloths
i
might
add
many
more
illustrations
but
a
single
one
in
relation
to
the
blind
which
was
accidentally
omitted
in
that
place
will
be
sufficient
the
blind
at
the
institution
in
this
city
as
well
as
in
other
similar
institutions
are
now
taught
to
read
and
write
with
considerable
facility
but
how
most
of
my
readers
may
have
heard
how
they
read
but
i
will
describe
the
process
as
well
as
i
can
a
description
of
their
method
of
writing
is
more
difficult
the
letters
are
formed
by
pressing
the
paper
while
quite
moist
upon
rather
large
type
which
raises
a
ridge
in
the
line
of
every
letter
and
which
remains
prominent
after
the
paper
is
dry
in
order
to
read
the
pupil
has
to
feel
out
these
ridges
a
circular
ridge
on
the
paper
he
is
told
is
o
a
perpendicular
one
i
a
crooked
one
s
they
read
music
and
arithmetic
printed
in
a
similar
manner
a
few
months
of
practice
in
this
way
will
enable
an
ingenious
youth
to
read
with
considerable
ease
and
despatch
now
if
nothing
is
wanting
but
a
little
training
to
render
the
touch
so
accurate
would
it
not
be
useful
to
train
every
child
to
judge
frequently
of
the
properties
of
bodies
by
this
sense
and
can
not
every
one
recall
to
his
mind
a
thousand
situations
in
which
a
greater
accuracy
of
this
sense
would
have
saved
him
much
inconvenience
as
well
as
afforded
him
no
little
pleasure
i
shall
conclude
this
section
with
a
few
remarks
on
the
hand
the
custom
of
neglecting
or
almost
neglecting
the
left
hand
though
nearly
universal
in
this
country
at
least
appears
to
me
to
be
wrong
decidedly
so
for
although
more
blood
may
be
sent
to
the
right
arm
than
to
the
left
as
physiologists
say
yet
the
difference
is
not
as
great
at
birth
as
it
is
afterward
so
that
education
either
weakens
the
one
or
strengthens
the
other
besides
this
we
occasionally
find
a
person
who
is
as
it
is
called
that
is
his
left
hand
and
arm
are
as
much
larger
and
stronger
than
the
right
as
the
right
is
usually
stronger
than
the
left
how
is
this
do
we
find
a
corresponding
change
in
the
internal
structure
but
suppose
it
could
be
ascertained
that
such
a
change
did
exist
which
i
believe
has
never
been
done
the
question
would
still
arise
whether
the
difference
was
the
same
at
birth
or
whether
the
more
frequent
use
of
the
left
hand
has
not
in
part
produced
it
i
do
not
mean
here
to
intimate
that
a
more
frequent
use
of
the
left
hand
than
the
right
would
make
new
grow
where
there
were
none
before
but
it
would
certainly
do
one
thing
it
would
make
the
same
vessels
carry
more
blood
than
they
did
before
which
is
in
effect
nearly
the
same
thing
for
the
more
blood
in
the
limb
as
a
general
rule
the
more
strength
provided
the
limb
is
in
due
health
and
exercise
the
inference
which
i
wish
the
reader
to
make
from
all
this
is
that
since
the
left
hand
and
arm
by
due
cultivation
and
without
essential
difference
or
change
of
structure
to
begin
with
can
occasionally
be
made
stronger
than
the
right
it
is
fair
to
conclude
that
it
may
if
found
desirable
be
always
rendered
more
nearly
equal
to
it
than
in
adult
years
we
usually
find
it
the
question
is
now
fairly
before
us
is
such
a
result
desirable
i
maintain
that
it
is
and
shall
endeavor
to
show
my
reasons
how
often
is
one
hand
injured
by
an
accident
or
rendered
nearly
useless
by
disease
but
if
it
should
be
the
right
how
helpless
it
makes
us
the
man
who
is
accustomed
to
shave
himself
must
now
resort
to
a
barber
if
he
is
a
barber
himself
or
almost
any
other
mechanic
his
business
must
be
discontinued
or
if
he
is
a
clerk
he
can
not
use
his
left
hand
and
must
consequently
lose
his
time
or
if
amputation
chances
to
be
performed
on
a
favorite
arm
how
entirely
useless
to
society
we
are
till
we
have
learned
to
use
the
other
it
not
only
takes
up
a
great
deal
of
valuable
time
to
acquire
a
facility
of
using
it
but
if
we
are
already
arrived
at
maturity
we
can
never
use
it
so
well
as
the
other
during
our
whole
lives
because
it
is
too
late
in
life
to
increase
its
size
and
strength
much
by
constant
exercise
whereas
in
youth
it
might
have
been
done
easily
is
it
not
then
important
for
these
and
many
more
reasons
to
teach
a
child
to
use
with
nearly
equal
readiness
both
of
his
hands
but
if
so
who
can
do
it
better
than
the
mother
and
when
can
it
be
better
done
than
in
the
earliest
infancy
when
is
the
time
which
would
be
devoted
to
it
worth
less
than
at
this
period

moral
character
this
work
might
be
extended
very
much
farther
did
it
comport
with
my
original
plan
but
i
hasten
to
close
the
volume
with
a
few
thoughts
on
certain
abuses
of
the
body
which
prevail
to
a
greater
or
less
extent
in
families
and
schools
and
to
which
i
have
not
adverted
elsewhere
the
seats
of
children
are
usually
bad
both
at
table
and
elsewhere
it
seems
not
enough
that
we
condemn
them
to
the
use
of
knives
forks
spoons
of
the
same
size
with
those
of
adults
we
go
farther
and
give
them
chairs
of
the
same
height
and
proportion
with
our
own
there
are
a
few
exceptions
to
the
truth
of
this
remark
here
and
there
we
see
a
child
chair
it
is
true
but
not
often
but
how
unreasonable
is
it
to
seat
a
child
in
a
chair
so
high
that
his
feet
can
not
reach
the
floor
and
so
constructed
that
there
is
no
outer
place
on
which
the
feet
can
rest
what
adult
would
be
willing
to
sit
in
so
painful
a
posture
with
his
legs
dangling
no
wonder
children
dislike
to
sit
much
in
such
circumstances
and
it
is
a
great
blessing
to
both
parent
and
child
that
they
do
no
wonder
children
hate
the
sabbath
especially
in
those
families
where
they
are
compelled
to
keep
the
day
holy
by
sitting
motionless
sabbath
schools
though
they
bring
with
them
some
evil
along
with
a
great
deal
of
good
are
a
relief
to
the
young
in
this
particular
especially
if
their
seats
are
more
comfortable
elsewhere
than
at
home
they
consider
it
much
more
tolerable
to
spend
the
morning
and
intermission
of
the
day
in
going
and
returning
from
sabbath
school
than
in
constant
and
close
confinement
they
prefer
variety
and
the
occasional
light
and
air
of
heaven
to
monotony
and
seclusion
and
silence
it
happens
however
that
the
seats
at
the
sabbath
school
and
at
church
are
not
always
what
they
should
be
nor
so
far
as
church
is
concerned
do
i
see
that
this
evil
can
be
wholly
avoided
children
usually
sit
with
their
parents
in
the
sanctuary
and
they
ought
to
do
so
and
the
height
of
the
seats
can
not
of
course
accommodate
both
if
there
is
a
building
erected
solely
for
the
use
of
the
sabbath
school
the
seats
may
be
constructed
accordingly
without
seriously
incommoding
anybody
but
in
the
church
i
do
not
see
as
i
have
once
before
observed
how
the
evil
can
be
remedied
the
greatest
trouble
in
regard
to
seats
however
is
at
the
day
school
especially
in
our
district
or
common
schools
there
it
is
usual
for
children
to
be
confined
six
hours
a
day
and
sometimes
two
in
succession
to
hard
narrow
plank
seats
a
large
proportion
of
which
are
without
backs
and
raised
so
high
that
the
feet
of
most
of
the
pupils
can
not
possibly
touch
the
floor
there
suspended
as
i
have
said
in
another
work
footnote
see
a
prize
essay
on
school
houses
page
between
the
heavens
and
the
earth
they
are
compelled
to
remain
motionless
for
an
hour
or
an
hour
and
a
half
together
i
have
also
shown
in
the
same
essay
that
in
regard
to
the
desks
and
indeed
many
other
things
which
pertain
to
or
are
connected
with
the
school
very
little
pains
is
taken
to
provide
for
the
physical
welfare
or
even
comfort
of
the
pupils
and
that
a
thorough
reform
on
the
subject
appears
to
be
indispensable
when
i
speak
of
hard
plank
seats
let
me
not
be
understood
as
hinting
at
the
necessity
of
cushions
when
i
wrote
the
essay
above
mentioned
i
did
indeed
believe
that
they
were
desirable
but
i
am
now
opposed
to
their
use
either
by
children
or
adults
even
where
a
laborious
employment
would
seem
to
demand
a
long
confinement
to
this
awkward
and
unnatural
position
if
our
seats
are
cushioned
we
shall
sit
too
easily
i
believe
that
our
health
requires
a
hard
seat
because
its
very
hardness
inclines
us
to
change
frequently
our
position
but
if
we
must
sit
be
it
ever
so
short
a
time
our
seats
should
always
have
backs
and
those
which
are
designed
for
children
should
not
be
so
high
as
to
render
them
uncomfortable
nor
should
the
backs
of
seats
be
so
high
as
they
usually
are
either
for
children
or
adults
they
should
never
come
much
higher
than
the
middle
of
the
body
if
they
reach
the
shoulders
they
either
favor
a
crouching
forward
or
interfere
with
the
free
action
of
the
lungs
this
might
be
deemed
a
proper
place
for
saying
something
on
the
position
of
children
in
manufactories
but
here
a
world
of
abuse
opens
upon
my
view
the
full
development
of
which
demands
a
large
volume
how
many
crooked
spines
emaciated
bodies
decaying
lungs
as
well
as
scrofulas
fevers
and
consumptions
are
either
induced
or
accelerated
by
these
unnatural
employments
i
mean
they
are
unnatural
for
the
as
to
employing
adults
in
them
i
have
nothing
at
present
to
say
but
when
i
think
of
the
cruel
custom
of
placing
children
in
these
places
whose
bodies
and
were
this
the
place
i
might
add
are
immature
and
especially
girls
i
am
compelled
by
the
voice
of
conscience
and
as
i
trust
by
a
regard
to
those
laws
which
god
has
established
in
our
physical
frames
but
which
are
yet
so
strangely
violated
to
protest
against
it
better
that
no
factories
should
exist
than
that
children
should
be
ruined
in
them
as
they
now
are
better
by
far
that
we
should
return
were
it
possible
to
the
primitive
habits
of
new
england
to
those
days
when
mothers
and
daughters
made
the
wearing
apparel
of
themselves
and
their
families
when
if
there
was
less
of
intellectual
cultivation
and
less
money
expended
for
luxuries
and
extravagances
there
was
much
more
of
health
and
happiness
there
is
one
more
species
of
abuse
to
which
in
closing
i
wish
to
direct
maternal
attention
i
allude
to
injudicious
modes
of
inflicting
corporal
punishment
let
me
not
be
understood
to
appear
in
this
place
as
the
advocate
of
bodily
punishments
of
any
kind
for
if
they
are
even
admissible
under
some
circumstances
i
am
fully
convinced
that
in
the
way
in
which
they
are
commonly
administered
they
do
much
more
harm
than
good
but
leaving
the
question
of
their
utility
in
the
abstract
wholly
untouched
and
taking
it
for
granted
for
the
present
that
they
are
as
is
undoubtedly
the
fact
sometimes
employed
and
will
continue
to
be
so
for
a
great
while
to
come
i
proceed
to
speak
of
their
more
flagrant
abuses
among
these
none
are
more
reprehensible
than
blows
of
any
kind
on
the
head
even
the
rod
is
objectionable
for
this
purpose
since
it
exposes
the
eyes
but
the
hand
in
boxing
the
ears
or
striking
in
any
way
is
more
so
the
bones
of
the
head
in
young
children
are
not
yet
firmly
knit
together
and
these
concussions
may
injure
the
tender
brain
i
know
of
whole
families
whose
mental
faculties
are
dull
as
the
consequence
i
believe
of
a
perpetual
boxing
and
striking
of
the
head
some
individuals
are
made
almost
idiots
in
this
very
but
the
worst
is
not
yet
told
many
teachers
are
in
the
habit
of
striking
their
pupils
heads
with
thick
heavy
books
and
with
wooden
rules
i
have
seen
one
of
the
latter
of
considerable
size
and
thickness
broken
in
two
across
the
head
of
a
very
small
boy
and
this
too
such
is
the
public
mind
in
the
presence
of
a
mother
who
was
paying
a
visit
to
the
school
i
have
seen
parents
and
masters
strike
the
heads
of
their
children
with
pieces
of
wood
of
much
larger
size
in
one
instance
with
a
common
sized
tailor
in
another
with
the
heavy
end
of
a
wooden
about
an
inch
in
diameter
children
are
sometimes
severely
beaten
across
the
middle
of
the
body
the
region
where
lie
the
vital
organs
the
lungs
the
heart
the
liver
they
are
sometimes
beaten
too
across
the
joints
or
in
any
place
that
the
excited
perhaps
passionate
teacher
or
parent
can
reach
rules
and
books
are
thrown
with
violence
at
pupils
in
school
there
is
a
story
in
the
annals
of
education
vol
iv
at
page
of
a
teacher
who
threw
a
rule
at
a
little
boy
six
years
old
which
struck
him
with
great
force
within
an
inch
of
one
of
his
eyes
had
it
struck
a
little
nearer
to
his
nose
it
would
in
all
probability
have
destroyed
his
left
eye
but
without
extending
these
remarks
any
farther
every
intelligent
mother
who
reads
what
i
have
already
written
will
see
as
i
trust
the
necessity
of
properly
informing
herself
on
the
great
subject
of
physical
education
and
of
being
better
prepared
than
she
has
hitherto
been
for
acquitting
herself
with
satisfaction
of
those
high
and
sacred
responsibilities
which
in
the
wise
arrangements
of
nature
and
providence
devolve
upon
her
