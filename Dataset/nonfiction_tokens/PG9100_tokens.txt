i
childhood
my
mother
was
fond
of
travelling
she
would
go
from
spain
to
england
from
london
to
paris
from
paris
to
berlin
and
from
there
to
christiania
then
she
would
come
back
embrace
me
and
set
out
again
for
holland
her
native
country
she
used
to
send
my
nurse
clothing
for
herself
and
cakes
for
me
to
one
of
my
aunts
she
would
write
after
little
sarah
i
shall
return
in
a
a
month
later
she
would
write
to
another
of
her
sisters
and
see
the
child
at
her
i
shall
be
back
in
a
couple
of
my
age
was
nineteen
i
was
three
years
old
and
my
two
aunts
were
seventeen
and
twenty
years
of
age
another
aunt
was
fifteen
and
the
eldest
was
but
the
last
one
lived
at
martinique
and
was
the
mother
of
six
children
my
grandmother
was
blind
my
grandfather
dead
and
my
father
had
been
in
china
for
the
last
two
years
i
have
no
idea
why
he
had
gone
there
my
youthful
aunts
always
promised
to
come
to
see
me
but
rarely
kept
their
word
my
nurse
hailed
from
brittany
and
lived
near
quimperlé
in
a
little
white
house
with
a
low
thatched
roof
on
which
wild
grew
that
was
the
first
flower
which
charmed
my
eyes
as
a
child
and
i
have
loved
it
ever
since
its
leaves
are
heavy
and
and
its
petals
are
made
of
the
setting
sun
brittany
is
a
long
way
off
even
in
our
epoch
of
velocity
in
those
days
it
was
the
end
of
the
world
fortunately
my
nurse
was
it
appears
a
good
kind
woman
and
as
her
own
child
had
died
she
had
only
me
to
love
but
she
loved
after
the
manner
of
poor
people
when
she
had
time
one
day
as
her
husband
was
ill
she
went
into
the
field
to
help
gather
in
potatoes
the
soil
was
rotting
them
and
there
was
no
time
to
be
lost
she
left
me
in
charge
of
her
husband
who
was
lying
on
his
breton
bedstead
suffering
from
a
bad
attack
of
lumbago
the
good
woman
had
placed
me
in
my
high
chair
and
had
been
careful
to
put
in
the
wooden
peg
which
supported
the
narrow
table
for
my
toys
she
threw
a
faggot
in
the
grate
and
said
to
me
in
breton
language
until
the
age
of
four
i
only
understood
breton
a
good
girl
milk
that
was
my
only
name
at
the
time
when
she
had
gone
i
tried
to
withdraw
the
wooden
peg
which
she
had
taken
so
much
trouble
to
put
in
place
finally
i
succeeded
in
pushing
aside
the
little
rampart
i
wanted
to
reach
the
ground
but
poor
little
me
i
fell
into
the
fire
which
was
burning
joyfully
the
screams
of
my
who
could
not
move
brought
in
some
neighbours
i
was
thrown
all
smoking
into
a
large
pail
of
fresh
milk
my
aunts
were
informed
of
what
had
happened
they
communicated
the
news
to
my
mother
and
for
the
next
four
days
that
quiet
part
of
the
country
was
ploughed
by
which
arrived
in
rapid
succession
my
aunts
came
from
all
parts
of
the
world
and
my
mother
in
the
greatest
alarm
hastened
from
brussels
with
baron
larrey
one
of
her
friends
who
was
a
young
doctor
just
beginning
to
acquire
celebrity
and
a
house
surgeon
whom
baron
larrey
had
brought
with
him
i
have
been
told
since
that
nothing
was
so
painful
to
witness
and
yet
so
charming
as
my
despair
the
doctor
approved
of
the
of
butter
which
was
changed
every
two
hours
dear
baron
larrey
i
often
saw
him
afterwards
and
now
and
again
we
shall
meet
him
in
the
pages
of
my
memoirs
he
used
to
tell
me
in
such
charming
fashion
how
those
kind
folks
loved
milk
blossom
and
he
could
never
refrain
from
laughing
at
the
thought
of
that
butter
there
was
butter
everywhere
he
used
to
say
on
the
bedsteads
on
the
cupboards
on
the
chairs
on
the
tables
hanging
up
on
nails
in
bladders
all
the
neighbours
used
to
bring
butter
to
make
masks
for
milk
blossom
mother
adorably
beautiful
looked
like
a
madonna
with
her
golden
hair
and
her
eyes
fringed
with
such
long
lashes
that
they
made
a
shadow
on
her
cheeks
when
she
looked
down
she
distributed
money
on
all
sides
she
would
have
given
her
golden
hair
her
slender
white
fingers
her
tiny
feet
her
life
itself
in
order
to
save
her
child
and
she
was
as
sincere
in
her
despair
and
her
love
as
in
her
unconscious
forgetfulness
baron
larrey
returned
to
paris
leaving
my
mother
aunt
rosine
and
the
surgeon
with
me
days
later
mother
took
back
in
triumph
to
paris
the
nurse
the
and
me
and
installed
us
in
a
little
house
at
neuilly
on
the
banks
of
the
seine
i
had
not
even
a
scar
it
appears
my
skin
was
rather
too
bright
a
pink
but
that
was
all
my
mother
happy
and
trustful
once
more
began
to
travel
again
leaving
me
in
care
of
my
aunts
two
years
were
spent
in
the
little
garden
at
neuilly
which
was
full
of
horrible
dahlias
growing
close
together
and
coloured
like
wooden
balls
my
aunts
never
came
there
my
mother
used
to
send
money
and
toys
the
died
and
my
nurse
married
a
concierge
who
used
to
pull
open
the
door
at
rue
de
provence
not
knowing
where
to
find
my
mother
and
not
being
able
to
write
my
nurse
without
telling
any
of
my
friends
took
me
with
her
to
her
new
abode
the
change
delighted
me
i
was
five
years
old
at
the
time
and
i
remember
the
day
as
if
it
were
yesterday
my
abode
was
just
over
the
doorway
of
the
house
and
the
window
was
framed
in
the
heavy
and
monumental
door
from
outside
i
thought
it
was
beautiful
and
i
began
to
clap
my
hands
on
reaching
the
house
it
was
towards
five
in
the
evening
in
the
month
of
november
when
everything
looks
grey
i
was
put
to
bed
and
no
doubt
i
went
to
sleep
at
once
for
there
end
my
recollections
of
that
day
the
next
morning
there
was
terrible
grief
in
store
for
me
there
was
no
window
in
the
little
room
in
which
i
slept
and
i
began
to
cry
and
escaped
from
the
arms
of
my
nurse
who
was
dressing
me
so
that
i
could
go
into
the
adjoining
room
i
ran
to
the
round
window
which
was
an
immense
above
the
doorway
i
pressed
my
stubborn
brow
against
the
glass
and
began
to
scream
with
rage
on
seeing
no
trees
no
no
leaves
falling
nothing
nothing
but
stone
cold
grey
ugly
stone
and
panes
of
glass
opposite
me
want
to
go
away
i
want
to
stay
here
it
is
all
black
black
it
is
ugly
i
want
to
see
the
ceiling
of
the
street
and
i
burst
into
tears
my
poor
nurse
took
me
up
in
her
arms
and
folding
me
in
a
rug
took
me
down
into
the
courtyard
up
your
head
milk
blossom
and
look
see
there
is
the
ceiling
of
the
street
it
comforted
me
somewhat
to
see
that
there
was
some
sky
in
this
ugly
place
but
my
little
soul
was
very
sad
i
could
not
eat
and
i
grew
pale
and
became
anaemic
and
should
certainly
have
died
of
consumption
if
it
had
not
been
for
a
mere
chance
a
most
unexpected
incident
one
day
i
was
playing
in
the
courtyard
with
a
little
girl
called
titine
who
lived
on
the
second
floor
and
whose
face
or
real
name
i
can
not
recall
when
i
saw
my
husband
walking
across
the
courtyard
with
two
ladies
one
of
whom
was
most
fashionably
attired
i
could
only
see
their
backs
but
the
voice
of
the
fashionably
attired
lady
caused
my
heart
to
stop
beating
my
poor
little
body
trembled
with
nervous
excitement
any
of
the
windows
look
on
to
the
courtyard
she
asked
madame
those
four
he
replied
pointing
to
four
open
ones
on
the
first
floor
the
lady
turned
to
look
at
them
and
i
uttered
a
cry
of
joy
rosine
aunt
rosine
i
exclaimed
clinging
to
the
skirts
of
the
pretty
visitor
i
buried
my
face
in
her
furs
stamping
sobbing
laughing
and
tearing
her
wide
lace
sleeves
in
my
frenzy
of
delight
she
took
me
in
her
arms
and
tried
to
calm
me
and
questioning
the
concierge
she
stammered
out
to
her
friend
understand
what
it
all
means
this
is
little
sarah
my
sister
child
the
noise
i
made
had
attracted
attention
and
people
opened
their
windows
my
aunt
decided
to
take
refuge
in
the
lodge
in
order
to
come
to
an
explanation
my
poor
nurse
told
her
about
all
that
had
taken
place
her
death
and
her
second
marriage
i
do
not
remember
what
she
said
to
excuse
herself
i
clung
to
my
aunt
who
was
deliciously
perfumed
and
i
would
not
let
go
of
her
she
promised
to
come
the
following
day
to
fetch
me
but
i
did
not
want
to
stay
any
longer
in
that
dark
place
i
asked
to
start
at
once
with
my
nurse
my
aunt
stroked
my
hair
gently
and
spoke
to
her
friend
in
a
language
i
did
not
understand
she
tried
in
vain
to
explain
something
to
me
i
do
not
know
what
it
was
but
i
insisted
that
i
wanted
to
go
away
with
her
at
once
in
a
gentle
tender
caressing
voice
but
without
any
real
affection
she
said
all
kinds
of
pretty
things
stroked
me
with
her
gloved
hands
patted
my
frock
which
was
turned
up
and
made
any
amount
of
charming
frivolous
little
gestures
but
all
without
any
real
feeling
she
then
went
away
at
her
entreaty
after
emptying
her
purse
in
my
hands
i
rushed
towards
the
door
but
the
husband
of
my
nurse
who
had
opened
it
for
her
now
closed
it
again
my
nurse
was
crying
and
taking
me
in
her
arms
she
opened
the
window
saying
to
me
cry
milk
blossom
look
at
your
pretty
aunt
she
will
come
back
again
and
then
you
can
go
away
with
great
tears
rolled
down
her
calm
round
handsome
face
i
could
see
nothing
but
the
dark
black
hole
which
remained
there
immutable
behind
me
and
in
a
fit
of
despair
i
rushed
out
to
my
aunt
who
was
just
getting
into
a
carriage
after
that
i
knew
nothing
more
everything
seemed
dark
there
was
a
noise
in
the
distance
i
could
hear
voices
far
far
away
i
had
managed
to
escape
from
my
poor
nurse
and
had
fallen
down
on
the
pavement
in
front
of
my
aunt
i
had
broken
my
arm
in
two
places
and
injured
my
left
i
only
came
to
myself
again
a
few
hours
later
to
find
that
i
was
in
a
beautiful
wide
bed
which
smelt
very
nice
it
stood
in
the
middle
of
a
large
room
with
two
lovely
windows
which
made
me
very
joyful
for
i
could
see
the
ceiling
of
the
street
through
them
my
mother
who
had
been
sent
for
immediately
came
to
take
care
of
me
and
i
saw
the
rest
of
my
family
my
aunts
and
my
cousins
my
poor
little
brain
could
not
understand
why
all
these
people
should
suddenly
be
so
fond
of
me
when
i
had
passed
so
many
days
and
nights
only
cared
for
by
one
single
person
as
i
was
weakly
and
my
bones
small
and
friable
i
was
two
years
recovering
from
this
terrible
fall
and
during
that
time
was
nearly
always
carried
about
i
will
pass
over
these
two
years
of
my
life
which
have
left
me
only
a
vague
memory
of
being
petted
and
of
a
chronic
state
of
torpor
ii
at
boarding
school
one
day
my
mother
took
me
on
her
knees
and
said
to
me
are
a
big
girl
now
and
you
must
learn
to
read
and
i
was
then
seven
years
old
and
could
neither
read
write
nor
count
as
i
had
been
five
years
with
the
old
nurse
and
two
years
must
go
to
school
continued
my
mother
playing
with
my
curly
hair
a
big
i
did
not
know
what
all
this
meant
and
i
asked
what
a
school
was
a
place
where
there
are
many
little
girls
replied
my
mother
they
ill
i
asked
no
they
are
quite
well
as
you
are
now
and
they
play
together
and
are
very
gay
and
i
jumped
about
in
delight
and
gave
free
vent
to
my
joy
but
on
seeing
tears
in
my
eyes
i
flung
myself
in
her
arms
what
about
you
mamma
i
asked
will
be
all
alone
and
you
have
any
little
she
bent
down
to
me
and
said
has
told
me
that
he
will
send
me
some
flowers
and
a
little
my
delight
was
more
and
more
boisterous
i
shall
have
a
little
brother
i
exclaimed
else
a
little
sister
oh
no
i
want
that
i
like
little
mamma
kissed
me
very
affectionately
and
then
i
was
dressed
i
remember
in
a
blue
corded
velvet
frock
of
which
i
was
very
proud
arrayed
thus
in
all
my
splendour
i
waited
impatiently
for
aunt
carriage
which
was
to
take
us
to
auteuil
it
was
about
three
when
she
arrived
the
housemaid
had
gone
on
about
an
hour
before
and
i
had
watched
with
delight
my
little
trunk
and
my
toys
being
packed
into
the
carriage
the
maid
climbed
up
and
took
the
seat
by
the
driver
in
spite
of
my
mother
protesting
at
first
against
this
when
my
magnificent
equipage
arrived
mamma
was
the
first
to
get
in
slowly
and
calmly
i
got
in
when
my
turn
came
giving
myself
airs
because
the
concierge
and
some
of
the
shopkeepers
were
watching
my
aunt
then
sprang
in
lightly
but
by
no
means
calmly
after
giving
her
orders
in
english
to
the
stiff
coachman
and
handing
him
a
paper
on
which
the
address
was
written
another
carriage
followed
ours
in
which
three
men
were
seated
régis
l
a
friend
of
my
general
de
p
and
an
artist
named
fleury
i
think
whose
pictures
of
horses
and
sporting
subjects
were
very
much
in
vogue
just
then
i
heard
on
the
way
that
these
gentlemen
were
to
make
arrangements
for
a
little
dinner
near
auteuil
to
console
mamma
for
her
great
trouble
in
being
separated
from
me
some
other
guests
were
to
be
there
to
meet
them
i
did
not
pay
very
much
attention
to
what
my
mother
and
my
aunt
said
to
each
other
sometimes
when
they
spoke
of
me
they
talked
either
english
or
german
and
smiled
at
me
affectionately
the
long
drive
was
greatly
appreciated
by
me
for
with
my
face
pressed
against
the
window
and
my
eyes
wide
open
i
gazed
out
eagerly
at
the
grey
muddy
road
with
its
ugly
houses
on
each
side
and
its
bare
trees
i
thought
it
was
all
very
beautiful
because
it
kept
changing
the
carriage
stopped
at
rue
boileau
auteuil
on
the
iron
gate
was
a
long
dark
signboard
with
gold
letters
i
looked
up
at
it
and
mamma
said
will
be
able
to
read
that
soon
i
my
aunt
whispered
to
me
school
madame
fressard
and
very
promptly
i
said
to
mamma
says
school
madame
mamma
my
aunt
and
the
three
gentlemen
laughed
heartily
at
my
assurance
and
we
entered
the
house
madame
fressard
came
forward
to
meet
us
and
i
liked
her
at
once
she
was
of
medium
height
rather
stout
and
her
hair
turning
grey
la
she
had
beautiful
large
eyes
rather
like
george
and
very
white
teeth
which
showed
up
all
the
more
as
her
complexion
was
rather
tawny
she
looked
healthy
spoke
kindly
her
hands
were
plump
and
her
fingers
long
she
took
my
hand
gently
in
hers
and
half
kneeling
so
that
her
face
was
level
with
mine
she
said
in
a
musical
voice
be
afraid
of
me
will
you
little
girl
i
did
not
answer
but
my
face
flushed
as
red
as
a
cockscomb
she
asked
me
several
questions
but
i
refused
to
reply
they
all
gathered
round
me
child
come
sarah
be
a
good
girl
oh
the
naughty
little
child
it
was
all
in
vain
i
remained
perfectly
mute
the
customary
round
was
then
made
to
the
the
the
and
the
usual
exaggerated
compliments
were
paid
beautifully
it
is
all
kept
how
spotlessly
clean
everything
is
and
a
hundred
stupidities
of
this
kind
about
the
comfort
of
these
prisons
for
children
my
mother
went
aside
with
madame
fressard
and
i
clung
to
her
knees
so
that
she
could
not
walk
is
the
prescription
she
said
and
then
followed
a
long
list
of
things
that
were
to
be
done
for
me
madame
fressard
smiled
rather
ironically
know
madame
she
said
to
my
mother
shall
not
be
able
to
curl
her
hair
like
you
certainly
will
not
be
able
to
uncurl
it
replied
my
mother
stroking
my
head
with
her
gloved
hands
a
regular
wig
and
they
must
never
attempt
to
comb
it
until
it
has
been
well
brushed
they
could
not
possibly
get
the
knots
out
otherwise
and
it
would
hurt
her
too
much
what
do
you
give
the
children
at
four
she
asked
changing
the
subject
a
slice
of
bread
and
just
what
the
parents
leave
for
are
twelve
pots
of
different
kinds
of
jam
said
my
mother
she
must
have
jam
one
day
and
chocolate
another
as
she
has
not
a
good
appetite
and
requires
change
of
food
i
have
brought
six
pounds
of
madame
fressard
smiled
in
a
but
rather
ironical
way
she
picked
up
a
packet
of
the
chocolate
and
looked
at
the
name
of
the
maker
from
what
a
spoiled
little
girl
it
is
she
patted
my
cheek
with
her
white
fingers
and
then
as
her
eyes
fell
on
a
large
jar
she
looked
surprised
cold
cream
said
my
mother
make
it
myself
and
i
should
like
my
little
face
and
hands
to
be
rubbed
with
it
every
night
when
she
goes
to
began
madame
fressard
pay
double
laundry
expenses
for
the
sheets
interrupted
my
mother
impatiently
ah
my
poor
mother
i
remember
quite
well
that
my
sheets
were
changed
once
a
month
like
those
of
the
other
pupils
the
farewell
moment
came
at
last
and
every
one
gathered
round
mamma
and
finally
carried
her
off
after
a
great
deal
of
kissing
and
with
all
kinds
of
consoling
words
will
be
so
good
for
her
it
is
just
what
she
needs
find
her
quite
changed
when
you
see
her
the
general
who
was
very
fond
of
me
picked
me
up
in
his
arms
and
tossed
me
in
the
air
little
chit
he
said
are
putting
you
into
barracks
and
have
to
mind
your
behaviour
i
pulled
his
long
moustache
and
he
said
winking
and
looking
in
the
direction
of
madame
fressard
who
had
a
slight
moustache
do
that
to
the
lady
you
know
my
aunt
laughed
heartily
and
my
mother
gave
a
little
stifled
laugh
and
the
whole
troop
went
off
in
a
regular
whirlwind
of
rustling
skirts
and
farewells
whilst
i
was
taken
away
to
the
cage
where
i
was
to
be
imprisoned
i
spent
two
years
at
this
pension
i
was
taught
reading
writing
and
reckoning
i
also
learnt
a
hundred
new
games
i
learnt
to
sing
and
to
embroider
handkerchiefs
for
my
mother
i
was
relatively
happy
there
as
we
always
went
out
somewhere
on
thursdays
and
sundays
and
this
gave
me
the
sensation
of
liberty
the
very
ground
in
the
street
seemed
to
me
quite
different
from
the
ground
of
the
large
garden
belonging
to
the
pension
besides
there
were
little
festivities
at
madame
which
used
to
send
me
into
raptures
mlle
stella
colas
who
had
just
made
her
at
the
théâtre
français
came
sometimes
on
thursdays
and
recited
poetry
to
us
i
could
never
sleep
a
wink
the
night
before
and
in
the
morning
i
used
to
comb
my
hair
carefully
and
get
ready
my
heart
beating
fast
with
excitement
in
order
to
listen
to
something
i
did
not
understand
at
all
but
which
nevertheless
left
me
then
too
there
was
quite
a
legend
attached
to
this
pretty
girl
she
had
flung
herself
almost
under
the
feet
as
the
emperor
was
driving
along
in
order
to
attract
his
attention
and
obtain
the
pardon
of
her
brother
who
had
conspired
against
his
sovereign
mlle
stella
colas
had
a
sister
at
madame
and
this
sister
clothilde
is
now
the
wife
of
pierre
merlou
under
secretary
of
state
in
the
treasury
department
stella
was
slight
and
fair
with
blue
eyes
that
were
rather
hard
but
expressive
she
had
a
deep
voice
and
when
this
pale
fragile
girl
began
to
recite
dream
it
thrilled
me
through
and
through
how
many
times
seated
on
my
bed
did
i
practise
saying
in
a
low
voice
fille
digne
de
i
used
to
twist
my
head
on
my
shoulders
swell
out
my
cheeks
and
commence
but
it
always
ended
badly
and
i
would
begin
again
very
quietly
in
a
stifled
voice
and
then
unconsciously
speak
louder
and
my
companions
roused
by
the
noise
were
amused
at
my
attempts
and
roared
with
laughter
i
would
then
rush
about
to
the
right
and
left
giving
them
kicks
and
blows
which
they
returned
with
interest
madame
adopted
daughter
mlle
caroline
whom
i
chanced
to
meet
a
long
time
after
married
to
the
celebrated
artist
yvon
would
then
appear
on
the
scene
angry
and
implacable
she
would
give
us
all
kinds
of
punishments
for
the
following
day
as
for
me
i
used
to
get
locked
up
for
three
days
that
was
followed
by
my
being
detained
on
the
first
day
we
were
allowed
out
and
in
addition
i
would
receive
five
strokes
with
a
ruler
on
my
fingers
ah
those
ruler
strokes
of
mlle
i
reproached
her
about
them
when
i
met
her
again
years
later
she
used
to
make
us
put
all
our
fingers
round
the
thumb
and
hold
our
hands
straight
out
to
her
and
then
bang
came
her
wide
ebony
ruler
she
used
to
give
us
a
cruelly
hard
sharp
blow
which
made
the
tears
spurt
to
our
eyes
i
took
a
dislike
to
mlle
caroline
she
was
beautiful
but
with
the
kind
of
beauty
i
did
not
care
for
she
had
a
very
white
complexion
and
very
black
hair
which
she
wore
in
waved
when
i
saw
her
a
long
time
afterwards
one
of
my
relatives
brought
her
to
my
house
and
said
am
sure
you
will
not
recognise
this
lady
and
yet
you
know
her
very
i
was
leaning
against
the
large
mantelpiece
in
the
hall
and
i
saw
this
tall
woman
still
beautiful
but
rather
coming
through
the
first
as
she
descended
the
three
steps
into
the
hall
the
light
fell
on
her
protruding
forehead
framed
on
each
side
with
the
hard
waved
caroline
i
exclaimed
and
with
a
furtive
childish
movement
i
hid
my
two
hands
behind
my
back
i
never
saw
her
again
for
the
grudge
i
had
owed
her
from
my
childhood
must
have
been
apparent
under
my
politeness
as
hostess
as
i
said
before
i
was
not
unhappy
at
madame
and
it
seemed
quite
natural
to
me
that
i
should
stay
there
until
i
was
quite
a
girl
my
uncle
félix
faure
who
has
entered
the
carthusian
monastery
had
stipulated
that
his
wife
my
sister
should
often
take
me
out
he
had
a
very
fine
country
place
at
neuilly
with
a
stream
running
through
the
grounds
and
i
used
to
fish
there
for
hours
together
with
my
two
cousins
a
boy
and
girl
these
two
years
of
my
life
passed
peacefully
without
any
other
events
than
my
terrible
fits
of
temper
which
upset
the
whole
pension
and
always
left
me
in
the
infirmary
for
two
or
three
days
these
outbursts
of
temper
were
like
attacks
of
madness
one
day
aunt
rosine
arrived
suddenly
to
take
me
away
altogether
my
father
had
written
giving
orders
as
to
where
i
was
to
be
placed
and
these
orders
were
imperative
my
mother
was
travelling
so
she
had
sent
word
to
my
aunt
who
had
hurried
off
at
once
between
two
dances
to
carry
out
the
instructions
she
had
received
the
idea
that
i
was
to
be
ordered
about
without
any
regard
to
my
own
wishes
or
inclinations
put
me
into
an
indescribable
rage
i
rolled
about
on
the
ground
uttering
the
most
heartrending
cries
i
yelled
out
all
kinds
of
reproaches
blaming
mamma
my
aunts
and
madame
fressard
for
not
finding
some
way
to
keep
me
with
her
the
struggle
lasted
two
hours
and
while
i
was
being
dressed
i
escaped
twice
into
the
garden
and
attempted
to
climb
the
trees
and
to
throw
myself
into
the
pond
in
which
there
was
more
mud
than
water
finally
when
i
was
completely
exhausted
and
subdued
i
was
taken
off
sobbing
in
my
carriage
i
stayed
three
days
at
her
house
as
i
was
so
feverish
that
my
life
was
said
to
be
in
danger
my
father
used
to
come
to
my
aunt
who
was
then
living
at
rue
de
la
chaussée
he
was
on
friendly
terms
with
rossini
who
lived
at
no
in
the
same
street
he
often
brought
him
in
and
rossini
made
me
laugh
with
his
clever
stories
and
comic
grimaces
my
father
was
as
as
a
god
and
i
used
to
look
at
him
with
pride
i
did
not
know
him
well
as
i
saw
him
so
rarely
but
i
loved
him
for
his
seductive
voice
and
his
slow
gentle
gestures
he
commanded
a
certain
respect
and
i
noticed
that
even
my
exuberant
aunt
calmed
down
in
his
presence
i
had
recovered
and
monod
who
was
attending
me
said
that
i
could
now
be
moved
without
any
fear
of
ill
effects
we
had
been
waiting
for
my
mother
but
she
was
ill
at
haarlem
my
aunt
offered
to
accompany
us
if
my
father
would
take
me
to
the
convent
but
he
refused
and
i
can
hear
him
now
with
his
gentle
voice
saying
her
mother
will
take
her
to
the
convent
i
have
written
to
the
faures
and
the
child
is
to
stay
there
a
my
aunt
was
about
to
protest
but
my
father
replied
quieter
there
my
dear
rosine
and
the
child
needs
tranquillity
more
than
anything
i
went
that
very
evening
to
my
aunt
i
did
not
care
much
for
her
as
she
was
cold
and
affected
but
i
adored
my
uncle
he
was
so
gentle
and
so
calm
and
there
was
an
infinite
charm
in
his
smile
his
son
was
as
turbulent
as
i
was
myself
adventurous
and
rather
so
that
we
always
liked
being
together
his
sister
an
adorable
girl
was
reserved
and
always
afraid
of
soiling
her
frocks
and
even
her
pinafores
the
poor
child
married
baron
cerise
and
died
during
her
confinement
in
the
very
flower
of
youth
and
beauty
because
her
timidity
her
reserve
and
narrow
education
had
made
her
refuse
to
see
a
doctor
when
the
intervention
of
a
medical
man
was
absolutely
necessary
i
was
very
fond
of
her
and
her
death
was
a
great
grief
to
me
at
present
i
never
see
the
faintest
ray
of
moonlight
without
its
evoking
a
pale
vision
of
her
i
stayed
three
weeks
at
my
roaming
about
with
my
cousin
and
spending
hours
lying
down
flat
fishing
for
in
the
little
stream
that
ran
through
the
park
this
park
was
immense
and
surrounded
by
a
wide
ditch
how
many
times
i
used
to
have
bets
with
my
cousins
that
i
would
jump
that
ditch
the
bet
was
sometimes
three
sheets
of
paper
or
five
pins
or
perhaps
my
two
pancakes
for
we
used
to
have
pancakes
every
tuesday
and
after
the
bet
i
jumped
more
often
than
not
falling
into
the
ditch
and
splashing
about
in
the
green
water
screaming
because
i
was
afraid
of
the
frogs
and
yelling
with
terror
when
my
cousins
pretended
to
rush
away
when
i
returned
to
the
house
my
aunt
was
always
watching
anxiously
at
the
top
of
the
stone
steps
for
our
arrival
what
a
lecture
i
had
and
what
a
cold
look
upstairs
and
change
your
clothes
mademoiselle
she
would
say
then
stay
in
your
room
your
dinner
will
be
sent
to
you
there
without
any
as
i
passed
the
big
glass
in
the
hall
i
caught
sight
of
myself
looking
like
a
rotten
tree
stump
and
i
saw
my
cousin
making
signs
by
putting
his
hand
to
his
mouth
that
he
would
bring
me
some
dessert
his
sister
used
to
go
to
his
mother
who
fondled
her
and
seemed
to
say
heaven
you
are
not
like
that
little
bohemian
this
was
my
stinging
epithet
for
me
in
moments
of
anger
i
used
to
go
up
to
my
room
with
a
heavy
heart
thoroughly
ashamed
and
vexed
vowing
to
myself
that
i
would
never
again
jump
the
ditch
but
on
reaching
my
room
i
used
to
find
the
daughter
there
a
big
awkward
merry
girl
who
used
to
wait
on
me
how
comic
mademoiselle
looks
like
that
she
would
say
laughing
so
heartily
that
i
was
proud
of
looking
comic
and
i
decided
that
when
i
jumped
the
ditch
again
i
would
get
weeds
and
mud
all
over
me
when
i
had
undressed
and
washed
i
used
to
put
on
a
flannel
gown
and
wait
in
my
room
until
my
dinner
came
soup
was
sent
up
and
then
meat
bread
and
water
i
detested
meat
then
just
as
i
do
now
and
threw
it
out
of
the
window
after
cutting
off
the
fat
which
i
put
on
the
rim
of
my
plate
as
my
aunt
used
to
come
up
unexpectedly
you
eaten
your
dinner
mademoiselle
she
would
ask
aunt
i
replied
you
still
hungry
out
and
the
three
times
you
little
this
was
because
i
had
not
been
baptized
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
my
uncle
would
come
upstairs
you
had
enough
dinner
he
would
ask
uncle
i
replied
you
eat
your
meat
i
threw
it
out
of
the
window
i
like
told
your
aunt
an
untruth
she
asked
me
if
i
had
eaten
my
dinner
and
i
answered
that
i
had
but
i
did
not
say
that
i
had
eaten
my
punishment
has
she
given
you
am
to
write
out
and
the
three
times
before
going
to
you
know
them
by
heart
not
very
well
i
make
mistakes
and
the
adorable
man
would
then
dictate
to
me
and
the
and
i
copied
it
in
the
most
devoted
way
as
he
used
to
dictate
with
deep
feeling
and
emotion
he
was
religious
very
religious
indeed
this
uncle
of
mine
and
after
the
death
of
my
aunt
he
became
a
carthusian
monk
as
i
write
these
lines
ill
and
aged
as
he
is
and
bent
with
pain
i
know
he
is
digging
his
own
grave
weak
with
the
weight
of
the
spade
imploring
god
to
take
him
and
thinking
sometimes
of
me
of
his
little
bohemian
ah
the
dear
good
man
it
is
to
him
that
i
owe
all
that
is
best
in
me
i
love
him
devotedly
and
have
the
greatest
respect
for
him
how
many
times
in
the
difficult
phases
of
my
life
i
have
thought
of
him
and
consulted
his
ideas
for
i
never
saw
him
again
as
my
aunt
quarrelled
purposely
with
my
mother
and
me
he
was
always
fond
of
me
though
and
has
told
his
friends
to
assure
me
of
this
occasionally
too
he
has
sent
me
his
advice
which
has
always
been
very
straightforward
and
full
of
indulgence
and
common
sense
recently
i
went
to
the
country
where
the
carthusians
have
taken
refuge
a
friend
of
mine
went
to
see
my
uncle
and
i
wept
on
hearing
the
words
he
had
dictated
to
be
repeated
to
me
to
return
to
my
story
after
my
visit
marie
the
daughter
came
to
my
room
looking
quite
indifferent
but
with
her
pockets
stuffed
with
apples
biscuits
raisins
and
nuts
my
cousin
had
sent
me
some
dessert
but
she
the
girl
had
cleared
all
the
dessert
dishes
i
told
her
to
sit
down
and
crack
the
nuts
and
i
would
eat
them
when
i
had
finished
my
and
she
sat
down
on
the
floor
so
that
she
could
hide
everything
quickly
under
the
table
in
case
my
aunt
returned
but
my
aunt
did
not
come
again
as
she
and
her
daughter
used
to
spend
their
evenings
at
the
piano
whilst
my
uncle
taught
his
son
mathematics
finally
my
mother
wrote
to
say
that
she
was
coming
there
was
great
excitement
in
my
house
and
my
little
trunk
was
packed
in
readiness
the
convent
which
i
was
about
to
enter
had
a
prescribed
uniform
and
my
cousin
who
loved
sewing
marked
all
my
things
with
the
initials
in
red
cotton
my
uncle
gave
me
a
silver
spoon
fork
and
goblet
and
these
were
all
marked
which
was
the
number
under
which
i
was
registered
there
marie
gave
me
a
thick
woollen
muffler
in
shades
of
violet
which
she
had
been
knitting
for
me
in
secret
for
several
days
my
aunt
put
round
my
neck
a
little
scapulary
which
had
been
blessed
and
when
my
mother
and
father
arrived
everything
was
ready
a
farewell
dinner
was
given
to
which
two
of
my
friends
aunt
rosine
and
four
other
members
of
the
family
were
invited
i
felt
very
important
i
was
neither
sad
nor
gay
but
had
just
this
feeling
of
importance
which
was
quite
enough
for
me
every
one
at
table
talked
about
me
my
uncle
kept
stroking
my
hair
and
my
cousin
from
her
end
of
the
table
threw
me
kisses
suddenly
my
musical
voice
made
me
turn
towards
him
to
me
sarah
he
said
you
are
very
good
at
the
convent
i
will
come
in
four
years
and
fetch
you
away
and
you
shall
travel
with
me
and
see
some
beautiful
i
will
be
good
i
exclaimed
be
as
good
as
aunt
henriette
this
was
my
aunt
faure
everybody
smiled
after
dinner
the
weather
being
very
fine
we
all
went
out
to
stroll
in
the
park
my
father
took
me
with
him
and
talked
to
me
very
seriously
he
told
me
things
that
were
sad
which
i
had
never
heard
before
i
understood
although
i
was
so
young
and
my
eyes
filled
with
tears
he
was
sitting
on
an
old
bench
and
i
was
on
his
knee
with
my
head
resting
on
his
shoulder
i
listened
to
all
he
said
and
cried
silently
my
childish
mind
disturbed
by
his
words
poor
father
i
was
never
never
to
see
him
again
iii
convent
life
i
did
not
sleep
well
that
night
and
the
following
morning
at
eight
we
started
by
diligence
for
versailles
i
can
see
marie
now
great
big
girl
as
she
then
was
in
tears
all
the
members
of
the
family
were
assembled
at
the
top
of
the
stone
steps
there
was
my
little
trunk
and
then
a
wooden
case
of
games
which
my
mother
had
brought
and
a
kite
that
my
cousin
had
made
which
he
gave
me
at
the
last
moment
just
as
the
carriage
was
starting
i
can
still
see
the
large
white
house
which
seemed
to
get
smaller
and
smaller
the
farther
we
drove
away
from
it
i
stood
up
with
my
father
holding
me
and
waved
his
blue
silk
muffler
which
i
had
taken
from
his
neck
after
this
i
sat
down
in
the
carriage
and
fell
asleep
only
rousing
up
again
when
we
were
at
the
door
of
the
convent
i
rubbed
my
eyes
and
tried
to
collect
my
thoughts
i
then
jumped
down
from
the
diligence
and
looked
curiously
around
me
the
of
the
street
were
round
and
small
with
grass
growing
everywhere
there
was
a
wall
and
then
a
great
gateway
surmounted
by
a
cross
and
nothing
behind
it
nothing
whatever
to
be
seen
to
the
left
there
was
a
house
and
to
the
right
the
satory
barracks
not
a
sound
to
be
heard
not
a
footfall
not
even
an
echo
mamma
i
exclaimed
it
inside
there
i
am
to
go
oh
no
i
would
rather
go
back
to
madame
my
mother
shrugged
her
shoulders
and
pointed
to
my
father
thus
explaining
that
she
was
not
responsible
for
this
step
i
rushed
to
him
and
he
took
me
by
the
hand
as
he
rang
the
bell
the
door
opened
and
he
led
me
gently
in
followed
by
my
mother
and
aunt
rosine
the
courtyard
was
large
and
but
there
were
buildings
to
be
seen
and
windows
from
which
faces
were
gazing
curiously
at
us
my
father
said
something
to
the
nun
who
came
forward
and
she
took
us
into
the
parlour
this
was
large
with
a
polished
floor
and
was
divided
by
an
enormous
black
grating
which
ran
the
whole
length
of
the
room
there
were
benches
covered
with
red
velvet
by
the
wall
and
a
few
chairs
and
armchairs
near
the
grating
on
the
walls
were
a
portrait
of
pius
a
full
length
one
of
augustine
and
one
of
henri
my
teeth
chattered
for
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
remembered
reading
in
some
book
the
description
of
a
prison
and
that
it
was
just
like
this
i
looked
at
my
father
and
my
mother
and
began
to
distrust
them
i
had
so
often
heard
that
i
was
ungovernable
that
i
needed
an
iron
hand
to
rule
me
and
that
i
was
the
devil
incarnate
in
a
child
my
aunt
faure
had
so
often
repeated
child
will
come
to
a
bad
end
she
has
such
mad
ideas
papa
i
suddenly
cried
out
seized
with
terror
go
to
prison
this
is
a
prison
i
am
sure
i
am
frightened
oh
i
am
so
frightened
on
the
other
side
of
the
grating
a
door
had
just
opened
and
i
stopped
to
see
who
was
coming
a
little
round
short
woman
made
her
appearance
and
came
up
to
the
grating
her
black
veil
was
lowered
as
far
as
her
mouth
so
that
i
could
scarcely
see
anything
of
her
face
she
recognised
my
father
whom
she
had
probably
seen
before
when
matters
were
being
arranged
she
opened
a
door
in
the
grating
and
we
all
went
through
to
the
other
side
of
the
room
on
seeing
me
pale
and
my
terrified
eyes
full
of
tears
she
gently
took
my
hand
in
hers
and
turning
her
back
to
my
father
raised
her
veil
i
then
saw
the
sweetest
and
merriest
face
imaginable
with
large
blue
eyes
a
nose
a
laughing
mouth
with
full
lips
and
beautiful
strong
white
teeth
she
looked
so
kind
so
energetic
and
so
happy
that
i
flung
myself
at
once
into
her
arms
it
was
mother
sophie
the
superior
of
the
convent
we
are
friends
now
you
see
she
said
to
my
father
lowering
her
veil
again
what
secret
instinct
could
have
told
this
woman
who
was
not
coquettish
who
had
no
and
never
troubled
about
beauty
that
her
face
was
fascinating
and
that
her
bright
smile
could
enliven
the
gloom
of
the
convent
will
now
go
and
see
the
house
she
said
we
at
once
started
she
and
my
father
each
holding
one
of
my
hands
two
other
nuns
accompanied
us
one
of
whom
was
the
mother
prefect
a
tall
cold
woman
with
thin
lips
and
the
other
sister
séraphine
who
was
as
white
and
supple
as
a
spray
of
lily
of
the
valley
we
entered
the
building
and
came
first
to
the
large
in
which
all
the
pupils
met
on
thursdays
at
the
lectures
which
were
nearly
always
given
by
mother
sophie
most
of
them
did
needlework
all
day
long
some
worked
at
tapestry
others
embroidery
and
still
others
decalcography
the
room
was
very
large
and
on
day
and
other
holidays
we
used
to
dance
there
it
was
in
this
room
too
that
once
a
year
the
mother
superior
gave
to
each
of
the
sisters
the
which
represented
her
annual
income
the
walls
were
adorned
with
religious
engravings
and
with
a
few
oil
paintings
done
by
the
pupils
the
place
of
honour
though
belonged
to
augustine
a
magnificent
large
engraving
depicted
the
conversion
of
this
saint
and
oh
how
often
i
have
looked
at
that
engraving
augustine
has
certainly
caused
me
very
much
emotion
and
greatly
disturbed
my
childish
heart
mamma
admired
the
cleanliness
of
the
refectory
she
asked
to
see
which
would
be
my
seat
at
table
and
when
this
was
shown
to
her
she
objected
strongly
to
my
having
that
place
she
said
child
has
not
a
strong
chest
and
she
would
always
be
in
a
draught
i
will
not
let
her
sit
my
father
agreed
with
my
mother
and
insisted
on
a
change
being
made
it
was
therefore
decided
that
i
should
sit
at
the
end
of
the
room
and
the
promise
given
was
faithfully
kept
when
mamma
saw
the
wide
staircase
leading
to
the
dormitories
she
was
aghast
it
was
very
very
wide
and
the
steps
were
low
and
easy
to
mount
but
there
were
so
many
of
them
before
one
reached
the
first
floor
for
a
few
seconds
mamma
hesitated
and
stood
there
gazing
at
them
her
arms
hanging
down
in
despair
down
here
youle
said
my
aunt
i
will
go
no
replied
my
mother
in
a
sorrowful
voice
must
see
where
the
child
is
to
sleep
she
is
so
my
father
helped
her
and
indeed
almost
carried
her
up
and
we
then
went
into
one
of
the
immense
dormitories
it
was
very
much
like
the
dormitory
at
madame
but
a
great
deal
larger
and
there
was
a
tiled
floor
without
any
carpet
this
is
quite
impossible
exclaimed
mamma
child
can
not
sleep
here
it
is
too
cold
it
would
kill
the
mother
superior
sophie
gave
my
mother
a
chair
and
tried
to
soothe
her
she
was
pale
for
her
heart
was
already
very
much
affected
will
put
your
little
girl
in
this
dormitory
madame
she
said
opening
a
door
that
led
into
a
room
with
eight
beds
the
floor
was
of
polished
wood
and
this
room
adjoining
the
infirmary
was
the
one
in
which
delicate
or
convalescent
children
slept
mamma
was
reassured
on
seeing
this
and
we
then
went
down
and
inspected
the
grounds
there
were
three
woods
the
wood
the
wood
and
the
wood
and
then
there
was
an
orchard
that
stretched
along
as
far
as
the
eye
could
see
in
this
orchard
was
the
building
where
the
poor
children
lived
they
were
taught
gratis
and
every
week
they
helped
with
the
laundry
for
the
convent
the
sight
of
these
immense
woods
with
swings
hammocks
and
a
gymnasium
delighted
me
for
i
thought
i
should
be
able
to
roam
about
at
pleasure
there
mother
sophie
explained
to
us
that
the
little
wood
was
reserved
for
the
older
pupils
and
the
middle
wood
for
the
little
ones
whilst
the
big
wood
was
for
the
whole
convent
on
holidays
then
after
telling
us
about
the
collecting
of
the
chestnuts
and
the
gathering
of
the
acacia
mother
sophie
informed
us
that
every
child
could
have
a
small
garden
and
that
sometimes
two
or
three
of
them
had
a
larger
one
can
i
have
a
garden
of
my
own
i
exclaimed
garden
all
to
myself
one
of
your
the
mother
superior
called
the
gardener
père
larcher
the
only
man
with
the
exception
of
the
chaplain
who
was
on
the
convent
staff
larcher
said
the
kind
woman
is
a
little
girl
who
wants
a
beautiful
garden
find
a
nice
place
for
good
reverend
mother
answered
the
honest
fellow
and
i
saw
my
father
slip
a
coin
into
his
hand
for
which
the
man
thanked
him
in
an
embarrassed
way
it
was
getting
late
and
we
had
to
separate
i
remember
quite
well
that
i
did
not
feel
any
grief
as
i
was
thinking
of
nothing
but
my
garden
the
convent
no
longer
seemed
to
me
like
a
prison
but
like
paradise
i
kissed
my
mother
and
my
aunt
papa
drew
me
to
him
and
held
me
a
moment
in
a
close
embrace
when
i
looked
at
him
i
saw
that
his
eyes
were
full
of
tears
i
did
not
feel
at
all
inclined
to
cry
and
i
gave
him
a
hearty
kiss
and
whispered
am
going
to
be
very
very
good
and
work
well
so
that
i
can
go
with
you
at
the
end
of
four
i
then
went
towards
my
mother
who
was
giving
mother
sophie
the
same
instructions
she
had
given
to
madame
fressard
about
cold
cream
chocolate
jam
mother
sophie
wrote
down
all
these
instructions
and
it
is
only
fair
to
say
that
she
carried
them
out
afterwards
most
scrupulously
when
my
parents
had
gone
i
felt
inclined
to
cry
but
the
mother
superior
took
me
by
the
hand
and
leading
me
to
the
middle
wood
showed
me
where
my
garden
would
be
that
was
quite
enough
to
distract
my
thoughts
for
we
found
père
larcher
there
marking
out
my
piece
of
ground
in
a
corner
of
the
wood
there
was
a
young
birch
tree
against
the
wall
the
corner
was
formed
by
the
joining
of
two
walls
one
of
which
bounded
the
railway
line
on
the
left
bank
of
the
river
which
cuts
the
satory
woods
in
two
the
other
wall
was
that
of
the
cemetery
all
the
woods
of
the
convent
were
part
of
the
beautiful
satory
forest
they
had
all
given
me
money
my
father
my
mother
and
my
aunt
i
had
altogether
about
forty
or
fifty
francs
and
i
wanted
to
give
all
to
père
larcher
for
buying
seed
the
mother
superior
smiled
and
sent
for
the
mother
treasurer
and
mother
appoline
i
had
to
hand
all
my
money
over
to
the
former
with
the
exception
of
twenty
sous
which
she
left
me
saying
that
is
all
gone
little
girl
come
and
get
some
more
from
mother
appoline
who
taught
botany
then
asked
me
what
kind
of
flowers
i
wanted
what
kind
of
flowers
why
i
wanted
every
sort
that
grew
she
at
once
proceeded
to
give
me
a
botany
lesson
by
explaining
that
all
flowers
did
not
grow
at
the
same
season
she
then
asked
the
mother
treasurer
for
some
of
my
money
which
she
gave
to
père
larcher
telling
him
to
buy
me
a
spade
a
rake
a
hoe
and
a
some
seeds
and
a
few
plants
the
names
of
which
she
wrote
down
for
him
i
was
delighted
and
i
then
went
with
mother
sophie
to
the
refectory
to
have
dinner
on
entering
the
immense
room
i
stood
still
for
a
second
amazed
and
confused
more
than
a
hundred
girls
were
assembled
there
standing
up
for
the
benediction
to
be
pronounced
when
the
mother
superior
appeared
every
one
bowed
respectfully
and
then
all
eyes
were
turned
on
me
mother
sophie
took
me
to
the
seat
which
had
been
chosen
for
me
at
the
end
of
the
room
and
then
returned
to
the
middle
of
the
refectory
she
stood
still
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
and
in
an
audible
voice
pronounced
the
benediction
as
she
left
the
room
every
one
bowed
again
and
i
then
found
myself
alone
quite
alone
in
this
cage
of
little
wild
animals
i
was
seated
between
two
little
girls
of
from
ten
to
twelve
years
old
both
as
dusky
as
two
young
moles
they
were
twins
from
jamaica
and
their
names
were
dolores
and
pepa
cardaños
they
had
only
been
in
the
convent
two
months
and
appeared
to
be
as
timid
as
i
was
the
dinner
was
composed
of
soup
made
of
everything
and
of
veal
with
haricot
beans
i
detested
soup
and
i
have
always
had
a
horror
of
veal
i
turned
my
plate
over
when
the
soup
was
handed
round
but
the
nun
who
waited
on
us
turned
it
round
again
and
poured
the
hot
soup
in
regardless
of
scalding
me
must
eat
your
soup
whispered
my
right
hand
neighbour
whose
name
was
pepa
like
that
sort
and
i
want
any
i
said
aloud
the
inspectress
was
passing
by
just
at
that
moment
must
eat
your
soup
mademoiselle
she
said
i
like
that
sort
of
soup
i
answered
she
smiled
and
said
in
a
gentle
voice
must
like
everything
i
shall
be
coming
round
again
just
now
be
a
good
girl
and
take
your
i
was
getting
into
a
rage
but
dolores
gave
me
her
empty
plate
and
ate
up
the
soup
for
me
when
the
inspectress
came
round
again
she
expressed
her
satisfaction
i
was
furious
and
put
my
tongue
out
and
this
made
all
the
table
laugh
she
turned
round
and
the
pupil
who
sat
at
the
end
of
the
table
and
was
appointed
to
watch
over
us
because
she
was
the
eldest
said
to
her
in
a
low
voice
the
new
girl
making
the
inspectress
moved
away
again
and
when
the
veal
was
served
my
portion
found
its
way
to
the
plate
of
dolores
i
wanted
to
keep
the
haricot
beans
though
and
we
almost
came
to
a
quarrel
over
them
she
gave
way
finally
but
with
the
veal
she
dragged
away
a
few
beans
which
i
tried
to
keep
on
my
plate
an
hour
later
we
had
evening
prayers
and
afterwards
all
went
up
to
bed
my
bed
was
placed
against
the
wall
in
which
there
was
a
niche
for
the
statue
of
the
virgin
mary
a
lamp
was
always
kept
burning
in
the
niche
and
the
oil
for
it
was
provided
by
the
children
who
had
been
ill
and
were
grateful
for
their
recovery
two
tiny
were
placed
at
the
foot
of
the
little
statue
the
pots
were
of
and
the
flowers
of
paper
i
made
paper
flowers
very
well
and
i
at
once
decided
that
i
would
make
all
the
flowers
for
the
virgin
mary
i
fell
asleep
to
dream
of
garlands
of
flowers
of
haricot
beans
and
of
distant
countries
for
the
twins
from
jamaica
had
made
an
impression
on
my
mind
the
awakening
was
cruel
i
was
not
accustomed
to
get
up
so
early
daylight
was
scarcely
visible
through
the
opaque
i
grumbled
as
i
dressed
for
we
were
allowed
a
quarter
of
an
hour
and
it
always
took
me
a
good
to
comb
my
hair
sister
marie
seeing
that
i
was
not
ready
came
towards
me
and
before
i
knew
what
she
was
going
to
do
snatched
the
comb
violently
out
of
my
hand
come
she
said
must
not
dawdle
like
she
then
planted
the
comb
in
my
mop
of
hair
and
tore
out
a
handful
of
it
pain
and
anger
at
seeing
myself
treated
in
this
way
threw
me
immediately
into
one
of
my
fits
of
rage
which
always
terrified
those
who
witnessed
them
i
flung
myself
upon
the
unfortunate
sister
and
with
feet
teeth
hands
elbows
head
and
indeed
all
my
poor
little
body
i
hit
and
thumped
yelling
at
the
same
time
all
the
pupils
all
the
sisters
and
indeed
every
one
came
running
to
see
what
was
the
matter
the
sisters
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
but
did
not
venture
to
approach
me
the
mother
prefect
threw
some
holy
water
over
me
to
exorcise
the
evil
spirit
finally
the
mother
superior
arrived
on
the
scene
my
father
had
told
her
of
my
fits
of
wild
fury
which
were
my
only
serious
fault
and
my
state
of
health
was
quite
as
much
responsible
for
them
as
the
violence
of
my
disposition
she
approached
me
as
i
was
still
clutching
sister
marie
though
i
was
exhausted
by
this
struggle
with
the
poor
woman
who
although
tall
and
strong
only
tried
to
ward
off
my
blows
without
retaliating
endeavouring
to
hold
first
my
feet
and
then
my
hands
i
looked
up
on
hearing
mother
voice
my
eyes
were
bathed
in
tears
but
nevertheless
i
saw
such
an
expression
of
pity
on
her
sweet
face
that
without
altogether
letting
go
i
ceased
fighting
for
a
second
and
all
trembling
and
ashamed
said
very
quickly
commenced
it
she
snatched
the
comb
out
of
my
hand
like
a
wicked
woman
and
tore
out
my
hair
she
was
rough
and
hurt
me
she
is
a
wicked
wicked
i
then
burst
into
sobs
and
my
hands
loosed
their
hold
the
next
thing
i
knew
was
that
i
found
myself
lying
on
my
little
bed
with
mother
hand
on
my
forehead
and
her
kind
deep
voice
lecturing
me
gently
all
the
others
had
gone
and
i
was
quite
alone
with
her
and
the
holy
virgin
in
the
niche
from
that
day
forth
mother
sophie
had
an
immense
influence
over
me
every
morning
i
went
to
her
and
sister
marie
whose
forgiveness
i
had
been
obliged
to
ask
before
the
whole
convent
combed
my
hair
out
in
her
presence
seated
on
a
little
stool
i
listened
to
the
book
that
the
mother
superior
read
to
me
or
to
the
instructive
story
she
told
me
ah
what
an
adorable
woman
she
was
and
how
i
love
to
recall
her
to
my
memory
i
adored
her
as
a
child
adores
the
being
who
has
entirely
won
its
heart
without
knowing
without
reasoning
without
even
being
aware
that
it
was
so
but
i
was
simply
under
the
spell
of
an
infinite
fascination
since
then
however
i
have
understood
and
admired
her
realising
how
unique
and
radiant
a
soul
was
imprisoned
under
the
exterior
and
happy
face
of
that
holy
woman
i
have
loved
her
ever
since
for
all
that
she
awakened
within
me
of
nobleness
i
love
her
for
the
letters
which
she
wrote
to
me
letters
that
i
often
read
over
and
over
again
i
love
her
also
because
imperfect
as
i
am
it
seems
to
me
that
i
should
have
been
one
hundred
times
more
so
had
i
not
known
and
loved
that
pure
creature
once
only
did
i
see
her
severe
and
felt
that
she
was
suddenly
angry
in
the
little
room
used
as
a
parlour
leading
into
her
cell
there
was
a
portrait
of
a
young
man
whose
handsome
face
was
stamped
with
a
certain
nobility
that
the
emperor
i
asked
her
she
answered
turning
quickly
towards
me
is
the
king
it
is
henri
it
was
only
later
on
that
i
understood
the
meaning
of
her
emotion
all
the
convent
was
royalist
and
henri
was
their
recognised
sovereign
they
all
had
the
most
utter
contempt
for
napoleon
and
on
the
day
when
the
prince
imperial
was
baptized
there
was
no
distribution
of
for
us
and
we
were
not
allowed
the
holiday
that
was
accorded
to
all
the
colleges
and
convents
politics
were
a
dead
letter
to
me
and
i
was
happy
at
the
convent
thanks
to
mother
sophie
then
too
i
was
a
favourite
with
my
schoolfellows
who
frequently
did
my
compositions
for
me
i
did
not
care
for
any
studies
except
geography
and
drawing
arithmetic
drove
me
wild
spelling
plagued
my
life
out
and
i
thoroughly
despised
the
piano
i
was
very
timid
and
quite
lost
my
head
when
questioned
unexpectedly
i
had
a
passion
for
animals
of
all
kinds
i
used
to
carry
about
with
me
in
small
cardboard
boxes
or
cages
that
i
manufactured
myself
adders
of
which
our
woods
were
full
crickets
that
i
found
on
the
leaves
of
the
tiger
lilies
and
lizards
the
latter
nearly
always
had
their
tails
broken
as
in
order
to
see
if
they
were
eating
i
used
to
lift
the
lid
of
the
box
a
little
and
on
seeing
this
the
lizards
rushed
to
the
opening
i
shut
the
box
very
quickly
red
with
surprise
at
such
assurance
and
in
a
twinkling
either
at
right
or
left
there
was
nearly
always
a
tail
caught
this
used
to
grieve
me
for
hours
and
whilst
one
of
the
sisters
was
explaining
to
us
by
figures
on
the
blackboard
the
metric
system
i
was
wondering
with
my
tail
in
my
hand
how
i
could
fasten
it
on
again
i
had
some
death
watches
in
a
little
box
and
five
spiders
in
a
cage
that
père
larcher
had
made
for
me
with
some
wire
netting
i
used
very
cruelly
to
give
flies
to
my
spiders
and
they
fat
and
well
fed
would
spin
their
webs
very
often
during
recreation
a
whole
group
of
us
ten
or
twelve
little
girls
would
stand
round
with
a
cage
on
a
bench
or
tree
stump
and
watch
the
wonderful
work
of
these
little
creatures
if
one
of
my
schoolfellows
cut
herself
i
used
to
go
at
once
to
her
feeling
very
proud
and
important
at
once
i
would
say
have
some
fresh
and
i
will
wrap
your
finger
in
provided
with
a
little
thin
stick
i
would
take
the
web
and
wrap
it
round
the
wounded
finger
now
my
lady
spiders
you
must
begin
your
work
again
and
active
and
minute
the
spiders
began
their
spinning
once
more
i
was
looked
upon
as
a
little
authority
and
was
made
umpire
in
questions
that
had
to
be
decided
i
used
to
receive
orders
for
fashionable
trousseaux
made
of
paper
for
dolls
it
was
quite
an
easy
thing
for
me
in
those
days
to
make
long
ermine
cloaks
with
fur
tippets
and
muff
and
this
filled
my
little
playfellows
with
admiration
i
charged
for
my
according
to
their
importance
two
pencils
five
nibs
or
a
couple
of
sheets
of
white
paper
in
short
i
became
a
personality
and
that
sufficed
for
my
childish
pride
i
did
not
learn
anything
and
i
received
no
distinctions
my
name
was
only
once
on
the
honour
list
and
that
was
not
as
a
studious
pupil
but
for
a
courageous
deed
i
had
fished
a
little
girl
out
of
the
big
pool
she
had
fallen
in
whilst
trying
to
catch
frogs
the
pool
was
in
the
large
orchard
on
the
poor
side
of
the
grounds
as
a
punishment
for
some
misdeed
which
i
do
not
remember
i
had
been
sent
away
for
two
days
among
the
poor
children
this
was
supposed
to
be
a
punishment
but
i
delighted
in
it
in
the
first
place
i
was
looked
upon
by
them
as
a
then
i
used
to
give
the
day
pupils
a
few
sous
to
bring
me
on
the
sly
a
little
moist
sugar
during
recreation
i
heard
some
heartrending
shrieks
and
rushing
to
the
pool
from
whence
they
came
i
jumped
into
the
water
without
reflecting
there
was
so
much
mud
that
we
both
sank
in
it
the
little
girl
was
only
four
years
old
and
so
small
that
she
kept
disappearing
i
was
over
ten
at
that
time
i
do
not
know
how
i
managed
to
rescue
her
but
i
dragged
her
out
of
the
water
with
her
mouth
nose
ears
and
eyes
all
filled
with
mud
i
was
told
afterwards
that
it
was
a
long
time
before
she
was
restored
to
consciousness
as
for
me
i
was
carried
away
with
my
teeth
chattering
nervous
and
half
fainting
i
was
very
feverish
afterwards
and
mother
sophie
herself
sat
up
with
me
i
overheard
her
words
to
the
doctor
child
she
said
one
of
the
best
we
have
here
she
will
be
perfect
when
once
she
has
received
the
holy
this
speech
made
such
an
impression
on
me
that
from
that
day
forth
mysticism
had
great
hold
on
me
i
had
a
very
vivid
imagination
and
was
extremely
sensitive
and
the
christian
legend
took
possession
of
me
heart
and
soul
the
son
of
god
became
the
object
of
my
worship
and
the
mother
of
the
seven
sorrows
my
ideal
iv
my
début
an
event
very
simple
in
itself
was
destined
to
disturb
the
silence
of
our
secluded
life
and
to
attach
me
more
than
ever
to
my
convent
where
i
wanted
to
remain
for
ever
the
archbishop
of
paris
monseigneur
sibour
was
paying
a
round
of
visits
to
some
of
the
communities
and
ours
was
among
the
chosen
ones
the
news
was
told
us
by
mother
alexis
the
the
most
aged
member
of
the
community
who
was
so
tall
so
thin
and
so
old
that
i
never
looked
upon
her
as
a
human
being
or
as
a
living
being
it
always
seemed
to
me
as
though
she
were
stuffed
and
as
though
she
moved
by
machinery
she
frightened
me
and
i
never
consented
to
go
near
her
until
after
her
death
we
were
all
assembled
in
the
large
room
which
we
used
on
thursdays
mother
alexis
supported
by
two
lay
sisters
stood
on
the
little
platform
and
in
a
voice
that
sounded
far
far
off
announced
to
us
the
approaching
visit
of
monseigneur
he
was
to
come
on
day
just
a
fortnight
after
the
speech
of
the
reverend
mother
our
peaceful
convent
was
from
thenceforth
like
a
into
which
a
hornet
had
entered
our
lesson
hours
were
curtailed
so
that
we
might
have
time
to
make
festoons
of
roses
and
lilies
the
wide
tall
of
carved
wood
was
uncushioned
so
that
it
might
be
varnished
and
polished
we
made
covered
with
crystalline
the
grass
was
pulled
up
in
the
courtyard
and
i
can
not
tell
what
was
not
done
in
honour
of
this
visitor
two
days
after
the
announcement
made
by
mother
alexis

large
assembly
room
we
were
all
in
tears
at
the
end
and
mother
thérèse
was
obliged
to
make
a
great
effort
in
order
to
avoid
committing
if
only
for
a
second
the
sin
of
pride
i
wondered
anxiously
what
part
i
should
take
in
this
religious
comedy
for
considering
that
i
was
now
treated
as
a
little
personage
i
had
no
doubt
that
some
would
be
given
to
me
the
very
thought
of
it
made
me
tremble
beforehand
i
began
to
get
quite
nervous
my
hands
became
quite
cold
my
heart
beat
furiously
and
my
temples
throbbed
i
did
not
approach
but
remained
sulkily
seated
on
my
stool
when
mother
thérèse
said
in
her
calm
voice
ladies
please
pay
attention
and
listen
to
your
names
and
the
different
parts
eugénie
charmel
amélie
pluche
renée
angel
louise
buguet
eulalie
lacroix
virginie
i
had
been
listening
although
pretending
not
to
and
i
was
stupefied
amazed
and
furious
mother
thérèse
then
added
are
your
manuscripts
young
ladies
and
a
manuscript
of
the
little
play
was
handed
to
each
pupil
chosen
to
take
part
in
it
louise
buguet
was
my
favourite
playmate
and
i
went
up
to
her
and
asked
her
to
let
me
see
her
manuscript
which
i
read
over
enthusiastically
make
me
rehearse
when
i
know
my
part
you
she
asked
and
i
answered
how
frightened
i
shall
be
she
said
she
had
been
chosen
for
the
angel
i
suppose
because
she
was
as
pale
and
sweet
as
a
moonbeam
she
had
a
soft
timid
voice
and
sometimes
we
used
to
make
her
cry
as
she
was
so
pretty
then
the
tears
used
to
flow
limpid
and
from
her
grey
questioning
eyes
she
began
at
once
to
learn
her
part
and
i
was
like
a
dog
going
from
one
to
another
among
the
chosen
ones
it
had
really
nothing
to
do
with
me
but
i
wanted
to
be
the
mother
superior
passed
by
and
as
we
all
curtseyed
to
her
she
patted
my
cheek
thought
of
you
little
girl
she
said
you
are
so
timid
when
you
are
asked
when
it
is
history
or
arithmetic
i
said
is
not
the
same
thing
and
i
should
not
have
been
she
smiled
distrustfully
and
moved
on
there
were
rehearsals
during
the
next
week
i
asked
to
be
allowed
to
take
the
part
of
the
monster
as
i
wanted
to
have
some
in
the
play
at
any
cost
it
was
decided
though
that
césar
the
convent
dog
should
be
the
fish
monster
a
competition
was
opened
for
the
fish
costume
i
went
to
an
endless
amount
of
trouble
cutting
out
scales
from
cardboard
that
i
had
painted
and
sewing
them
together
afterwards
i
made
some
enormous
gills
which
were
to
be
glued
on
to
césar
my
costume
was
not
chosen
it
was
passed
over
for
that
of
a
stupid
big
girl
whose
name
i
can
not
remember
she
had
made
a
huge
tail
of
kid
and
a
mask
with
big
eyes
and
gills
but
there
were
no
scales
and
we
should
have
to
see
shaggy
coat
i
nevertheless
turned
my
attention
to
louise
costume
and
worked
at
it
with
two
of
the
lay
sisters
sister
cécile
and
sister
jeanne
who
had
charge
of
the
linen
room
at
the
rehearsals
not
a
word
could
be
extorted
from
the
angel
raphael
she
stood
there
stupefied
on
the
little
platform
tears
dimming
her
beautiful
eyes
she
brought
the
whole
play
to
a
standstill
and
kept
appealing
to
me
in
a
weeping
voice
i
prompted
her
and
getting
up
rushed
to
her
kissed
her
and
whispered
her
whole
speech
to
her
i
was
beginning
to
be
myself
at
last
finally
two
days
before
the
great
solemnity
there
was
a
dress
rehearsal
the
angel
looked
lovely
but
immediately
on
entering
she
sank
down
on
a
bench
sobbing
out
in
an
imploring
voice
no
i
shall
never
be
able
to
do
it
never
true
she
never
will
be
able
to
sighed
mother
sophie
forgetting
for
the
moment
my
little
grief
and
wild
with
joy
pride
and
assurance
i
ran
up
to
the
platform
and
bounded
on
to
the
form
on
which
the
angel
raphael
had
sunk
down
weeping
mother
i
know
her
part
shall
i
take
her
place
for
the
rehearsal
yes
exclaimed
voices
from
all
sides
yes
you
know
it
so
well
said
louise
buguet
and
she
wanted
to
put
her
band
on
my
head
let
me
rehearse
as
i
am
first
i
answered
they
began
the
second
scene
again
and
i
came
in
carrying
a
long
branch
of
willow
nothing
tobias
i
commenced
will
be
your
guide
i
will
remove
from
your
path
all
thorns
and
stones
you
are
overwhelmed
with
fatigue
lie
down
and
rest
for
i
will
watch
over
whereupon
tobias
worn
out
lay
down
by
the
side
of
a
strip
of
blue
muslin
about
five
yards
of
which
stretched
out
and
winding
about
represented
the
tigris
i
then
continued
with
a
prayer
to
god
whilst
tobias
fell
asleep
césar
next
appeared
as
the
monster
fish
and
the
audience
trembled
with
fear
césar
had
been
well
taught
by
the
gardener
père
larcher
and
he
advanced
slowly
from
under
the
blue
muslin
he
was
wearing
his
mask
representing
the
head
of
a
fish
two
enormous
for
his
eyes
had
been
painted
white
and
a
hole
pierced
through
them
so
that
the
dog
could
see
the
mask
was
fastened
with
wire
to
his
collar
which
also
supported
two
gills
as
large
as
palm
leaves
césar
sniffing
the
ground
snorted
and
growled
and
then
leaped
wildly
on
to
tobias
who
with
his
cudgel
slew
the
monster
at
one
blow
the
dog
fell
on
his
back
with
his
four
paws
in
the
air
and
then
rolled
over
on
to
his
side
pretending
to
be
dead
there
was
wild
delight
in
the
house
and
the
audience
clapped
and
stamped
the
younger
pupils
stood
up
on
their
stools
and
shouted
césar
clever
césar
oh
good
dog
good
dog
the
sisters
touched
by
the
efforts
of
the
guardian
of
the
convent
shook
their
heads
with
emotion
as
for
me
i
quite
forgot
that
i
was
the
angel
raphael
and
i
stooped
down
and
stroked
césar
affectionately
how
well
he
has
acted
his
part
i
said
kissing
him
and
taking
one
paw
and
then
the
other
in
my
hand
whilst
the
dog
motionless
continued
to
be
dead
the
little
bell
was
rung
to
call
us
to
order
i
stood
up
again
and
accompanied
by
the
piano
we
burst
into
a
hymn
of
praise
a
duet
to
the
glory
of
god
who
had
just
saved
tobias
from
the
fearful
monster
after
this
the
little
green
serge
curtain
was
drawn
and
i
was
surrounded
petted
and
praised
mother
sophie
came
up
on
to
the
platform
and
kissed
me
affectionately
as
to
louise
buguet
she
was
now
joyful
again
and
her
angelic
face
beamed
how
well
you
knew
the
part
she
said
then
too
every
one
can
hear
what
you
say
oh
thank
you
so
much
she
kissed
me
and
i
hugged
her
with
all
my
might
at
last
i
was
in
it
the
third
scene
began
the
action
took
place
in
father
house
gabael
the
angel
and
young
tobias
were
holding
the
entrails
of
the
fish
in
their
hands
and
looking
at
them
the
angel
explained
how
they
must
be
used
for
rubbing
the
blind
eyes
i
felt
rather
sick
for
i
was
holding
in
my
hand
a
liver
and
the
heart
and
gizzard
of
a
fowl
i
had
never
touched
such
things
before
and
every
now
and
then
the
nausea
overcame
me
and
the
tears
rose
to
my
eyes
finally
the
blind
father
came
in
led
by
sister
gabael
knelt
down
before
the
old
man
and
gave
him
the
ten
silver
talents
telling
him
in
a
long
recital
of
exploits
in
medea
after
this
tobias
advanced
embraced
his
father
and
then
rubbed
his
eyes
with
the
liver
eugénie
charmel
made
a
grimace
but
after
wiping
her
eyes
she
exclaimed
can
see
i
can
see
oh
god
of
goodness
god
of
mercy
i
can
see
i
can
see
she
came
forward
with
outstretched
arms
her
eyes
open
in
an
ecstatic
attitude
and
the
whole
little
assembly
so
and
loving
wept
all
the
actors
except
old
tobit
and
the
angel
sank
on
their
knees
and
gave
praise
to
god
and
at
the
close
of
this
thanksgiving
the
public
moved
by
religious
sentiment
and
discipline
repeated
amen
mother
then
approached
the
angel
and
said
noble
stranger
take
up
your
abode
from
henceforth
with
us
you
shall
be
our
guest
our
son
our
brother
i
advanced
and
in
a
long
speech
of
at
least
thirty
lines
made
known
that
i
was
the
messenger
of
god
that
i
was
the
angel
raphael
i
then
gathered
up
quickly
the
pale
blue
tarlatan
which
was
being
concealed
for
a
final
effect
and
veiled
myself
in
cloudy
tissue
which
was
intended
to
simulate
my
flight
heavenwards
the
little
green
serge
curtain
was
then
closed
on
this
apotheosis
finally
the
solemn
day
arrived
i
was
so
feverish
with
expectation
that
i
could
not
sleep
the
last
three
nights
the
dressing
bell
was
rung
for
us
earlier
than
usual
but
i
was
already
up
and
trying
to
smooth
my
rebellious
hair
which
i
brushed
with
a
wet
brush
by
way
of
making
it
behave
better
monseigneur
was
to
arrive
at
eleven
in
the
morning
we
therefore
lunched
at
ten
and
were
then
drawn
up
in
the
principal
courtyard
only
mother
alexis
the
eldest
of
the
nuns
was
in
front
and
mother
sophie
just
behind
her
the
chaplain
was
a
little
distance
away
from
the
two
superiors
then
came
the
other
nuns
and
behind
them
the
girls
and
then
all
the
little
children
the
lay
sisters
and
the
servants
were
also
there
we
were
all
dressed
in
white
with
the
respective
colours
of
our
various
classes
the
bell
rang
out
a
peal
the
large
carriage
entered
the
first
courtyard
the
gate
of
the
principal
courtyard
was
then
opened
and
monseigneur
appeared
on
the
carriage
steps
which
the
footman
lowered
for
him
mother
alexis
advanced
and
bending
down
kissed
the
episcopal
ring
mother
sophie
the
superior
who
was
younger
knelt
down
to
kiss
the
ring
the
signal
was
then
given
to
us
and
we
all
knelt
to
receive
the
benediction
of
monseigneur
when
we
looked
up
again
the
big
gate
was
closed
and
monseigneur
had
disappeared
conducted
by
the
mother
superior
mother
alexis
was
exhausted
and
went
back
to
her
cell
in
obedience
to
the
signal
given
we
all
rose
from
our
knees
we
then
went
to
the
chapel
where
a
short
mass
was
celebrated
after
which
we
had
an
recreation
the
concert
was
to
commence
at
one
the
recreation
hour
was
devoted
to
preparing
the
large
room
and
to
getting
ready
to
appear
before
monseigneur
i
wore
the
long
robe
with
a
blue
sash
round
my
waist
and
two
paper
wings
fastened
on
with
narrow
blue
straps
that
crossed
over
each
other
in
front
round
my
head
was
a
band
of
gold
braid
fastening
behind
i
kept
mumbling
my
for
in
those
days
we
did
not
know
the
word
people
are
more
familiar
with
the
stage
nowadays
but
at
the
convent
we
always
said
and
years
afterwards
i
was
surprised
the
first
time
i
played
in
england
to
hear
a
young
english
girl
say
what
a
fine
part
you
had
in
the
room
looked
beautiful
oh
so
beautiful
there
were
festoons
of
green
leaves
with
paper
flowers
at
intervals
everywhere
then
there
were
little
lustres
hung
about
with
gold
cord
a
wide
piece
of
red
velvet
carpet
was
laid
down
from
the
door
to
upon
which
were
two
cushions
of
red
velvet
with
gold
fringe
i
thought
all
these
horrors
very
fine
very
beautiful
the
concert
began
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
everything
went
very
well
monseigneur
however
could
not
help
smiling
at
the
sight
of
césar
and
it
was
he
who
led
the
applause
when
the
dog
died
it
was
césar
in
fact
who
made
the
greatest
success
but
we
were
nevertheless
sent
for
to
appear
before
monseigneur
sibour
he
was
certainly
the
kindest
and
most
charming
of
prelates
and
on
this
occasion
he
gave
to
each
of
us
a
consecrated
medal
when
my
turn
came
he
took
my
hand
in
his
and
said
is
you
my
child
who
are
not
baptized
is
it
not
reverend
father
yes
monseigneur
i
replied
in
confusion
is
to
be
baptized
this
spring
said
the
mother
superior
father
is
coming
back
specially
from
a
very
distant
she
and
monseigneur
then
said
a
few
words
to
each
other
in
a
very
low
voice
well
if
i
can
i
will
come
again
for
the
ceremony
said
the
archbishop
aloud
i
was
trembling
with
emotion
and
pride
as
i
kissed
the
old
ring
i
then
ran
away
to
the
dormitory
and
cried
for
a
long
time
i
was
found
there
later
on
fast
asleep
from
exhaustion
from
that
day
forth
i
was
a
better
child
more
studious
and
less
violent
in
my
fits
of
anger
i
was
calmed
by
the
mention
of
monseigneur
name
and
reminded
of
his
promise
to
come
for
my
baptism
alas
i
was
not
destined
to
have
that
great
joy
one
morning
in
january
when
we
were
all
assembled
in
the
chapel
for
mass
i
was
surprised
and
had
a
foreboding
of
coming
evil
as
i
saw
the
abbé
lethurgi
go
up
into
the
pulpit
before
commencing
the
mass
he
was
very
pale
and
i
turned
instinctively
to
look
at
the
mother
superior
she
was
seated
in
her
regular
place
the
almoner
then
began
in
a
voice
broken
with
emotion
to
tell
us
of
the
murder
of
monseigneur
sibour
murdered
a
thrill
of
horror
went
through
us
and
a
hundred
stifled
cries
forming
one
great
sob
drowned
for
an
instant
the
voice
murdered
the
word
seemed
to
sting
me
personally
even
more
than
the
others
had
i
not
been
for
one
instant
the
favourite
of
the
kind
old
man
it
was
as
though
the
murderer
verger
had
struck
at
me
too
in
my
grateful
love
for
the
prelate
in
my
little
fame
of
which
he
had
now
robbed
me
i
burst
into
sobs
and
the
organ
accompanying
the
prayer
for
the
dead
increased
my
grief
which
became
so
intense
that
i
fainted
it
was
from
this
moment
that
i
was
taken
with
an
ardent
love
for
mysticism
it
was
fortified
by
the
religious
exercises
the
dramatic
effect
of
our
worship
and
the
gentle
encouragement
both
fervent
and
sincere
of
those
who
were
educating
me
they
were
very
fond
of
me
and
i
adored
them
so
that
even
now
the
very
memory
of
them
fascinating
and
restful
as
it
is
thrills
me
with
affection
the
time
appointed
for
my
baptism
drew
near
and
i
grew
more
and
more
excitable
my
nervous
attacks
were
more
and
more
frequent
fits
of
tears
for
no
reason
at
all
and
fits
of
terror
without
any
cause
everything
seemed
to
take
strange
proportions
as
far
as
i
was
concerned
one
day
one
of
my
little
friends
dropped
a
doll
that
i
had
lent
her
for
i
played
with
dolls
until
i
was
over
thirteen
i
began
to
tremble
all
over
as
i
adored
that
doll
which
had
been
given
to
me
by
my
father
have
broken
my
head
you
naughty
girl
i
exclaimed
have
hurt
my
father
i
would
not
eat
anything
afterwards
and
in
the
night
i
woke
up
in
a
great
perspiration
with
haggard
eyes
sobbing
is
dead
papa
is
dead
three
days
later
my
mother
came
she
asked
to
see
me
in
the
parlour
and
making
me
stand
in
front
of
her
she
said
poor
little
girl
i
have
something
to
tell
you
that
will
cause
you
great
sorrow
papa
is
know
i
said
and
the
expression
in
my
eyes
my
mother
frequently
told
me
afterwards
was
such
that
she
trembled
a
long
time
for
my
reason
i
was
very
sad
and
not
at
all
well
i
refused
to
learn
anything
except
catechism
and
scripture
and
i
wanted
to
be
a
nun
my
mother
had
succeeded
in
arranging
that
my
two
sisters
should
be
baptized
with
me
jeanne
who
was
then
six
years
old
and
régina
who
was
not
three
but
who
had
been
taken
as
a
boarder
at
the
convent
with
the
idea
that
her
presence
might
cheer
me
up
a
little
i
was
isolated
for
a
week
before
my
baptism
and
for
a
week
afterwards
as
i
was
to
be
confirmed
one
week
after
the
event
my
mother
aunt
rosine
berendt
and
aunt
henriette
faure
my
godfather
régis
monsieur
meydieu
godfather
and
general
polhes
godfather
the
godmothers
of
my
two
sisters
and
my
various
cousins
all
came
and
revolutionised
the
convent
my
mother
and
my
aunts
were
in
fashionable
mourning
attire
aunt
rosine
had
put
a
spray
of
lilac
in
her
bonnet
enliven
her
mourning
as
she
said
it
was
a
strange
expression
but
i
have
certainly
heard
it
since
used
by
other
people
besides
her
i
had
never
before
felt
so
far
away
from
all
these
people
who
had
come
there
on
my
account
i
adored
my
mother
but
with
a
touching
and
fervent
desire
to
leave
her
never
to
see
her
again
to
sacrifice
her
to
god
as
to
the
others
i
did
not
see
them
i
was
very
grave
and
rather
moody
a
short
time
previously
a
nun
had
taken
the
veil
at
the
convent
and
i
could
think
of
nothing
else
this
baptismal
ceremony
was
the
prelude
to
my
dream
i
could
see
myself
like
the
novice
who
had
just
been
admitted
as
a
nun
i
pictured
myself
lying
down
on
the
ground
covered
over
with
the
heavy
black
cloth
with
its
white
cross
and
four
massive
candlesticks
placed
at
the
four
corners
of
the
cloth
and
i
planned
to
die
under
this
cloth
how
i
was
to
do
this
i
do
not
know
i
did
not
think
of
killing
myself
as
i
knew
that
would
be
a
crime
but
i
made
up
my
mind
to
die
like
this
and
my
ideas
galloped
along
so
that
i
saw
in
my
imagination
the
horror
of
the
sisters
and
heard
the
cries
of
the
pupils
and
was
delighted
at
the
emotion
which
i
had
caused
after
the
baptismal
ceremony
my
mother
wished
to
take
me
away
with
her
she
had
rented
a
small
house
with
a
garden
in
the
boulevard
de
la
reine
at
versailles
for
my
holidays
and
she
had
decorated
it
with
flowers
for
this
day
as
she
wanted
to
celebrate
the
baptism
of
her
three
children
she
was
very
gently
told
that
as
i
was
to
be
confirmed
in
a
time
i
was
now
to
be
isolated
until
then
my
mother
cried
and
i
can
remember
now
to
my
sorrow
that
it
did
not
make
me
sad
to
see
her
tears
but
quite
the
contrary
when
every
one
had
gone
and
i
went
into
the
little
cell
in
which
i
had
been
living
for
the
last
week
and
wherein
i
was
to
live
for
another
week
i
fell
on
my
knees
in
a
state
of
exaltation
and
offered
up
to
god
my
sorrow
saw
o
lord
god
that
mamma
cried
and
that
it
did
not
affect
me
poor
child
that
i
was
i
imagined
in
my
wild
exaggeration
of
everything
that
what
was
expected
from
me
was
the
renunciation
of
all
affection
devotion
and
pity
the
following
day
mother
sophie
lectured
me
gently
about
my
wrong
comprehension
of
religious
duties
and
she
told
me
that
when
once
i
was
confirmed
she
should
give
me
a
holiday
to
go
and
make
my
mother
forget
her
sorrow
and
disappointment
my
confirmation
took
place
with
the
same
pompous
ceremonial
all
the
pupils
dressed
in
white
carried
wax
tapers
for
the
whole
week
i
had
refused
to
eat
i
was
pale
and
had
grown
thinner
and
my
eyes
looked
larger
from
my
perpetual
transports
for
i
went
to
extremes
in
everything
baron
larrey
who
came
with
my
mother
to
my
confirmation
asked
for
a
holiday
for
me
to
recruit
and
this
was
granted
accordingly
we
started
my
mother
madame
guérard
her
son
ernest
my
sister
jeanne
and
i
for
cauterets
in
the
pyrénées
the
movement
the
packing
of
the
trunks
parcels
and
packages
the
railway
the
diligence
the
scenery
the
crowds
and
the
general
disturbance
cured
me
of
my
nerves
and
my
mysticism
i
clapped
my
hands
laughed
aloud
flung
myself
on
mamma
and
nearly
stifled
her
with
kisses
i
sang
hymns
at
the
top
of
my
voice
i
was
hungry
and
thirsty
so
i
ate
drank
and
in
a
word
lived
v
the
shako
cauterets
at
that
time
was
not
what
it
is
now
it
was
an
abominable
but
charming
little
hole
of
a
place
with
plenty
of
verdure
very
few
houses
and
a
great
many
huts
belonging
to
the
mountain
people
there
were
plenty
of
donkeys
to
be
hired
that
took
us
up
the
mountains
by
extraordinary
paths
i
adore
the
sea
and
the
plain
but
i
neither
care
for
mountains
nor
for
forests
mountains
seem
to
crush
me
and
forests
to
stifle
me
i
must
at
any
cost
have
the
horizon
stretching
oat
as
far
as
the
eye
can
see
and
skies
to
dream
about
i
wanted
to
go
up
the
mountains
so
that
they
should
lose
their
crushing
effect
and
consequently
we
went
up
always
higher
and
higher
mamma
used
to
stay
at
home
with
her
sweet
friend
madame
guérard
she
used
to
read
novels
whilst
madame
guérard
embroidered
they
would
sit
there
together
without
speaking
each
dreaming
her
own
dream
seeing
it
fade
away
and
beginning
it
over
again
the
old
servant
marguerite
was
the
only
domestic
mamma
had
brought
with
her
and
she
used
to
accompany
us
gay
and
daring
she
always
knew
how
to
make
the
men
laugh
with
her
prattle
the
sense
and
crudeness
of
which
i
did
not
understand
until
much
later
she
was
the
life
of
the
party
always
as
she
had
been
with
us
from
the
time
we
were
born
she
was
very
familiar
and
sometimes
objectionably
so
but
i
would
not
let
her
have
her
own
way
with
me
though
and
i
used
to
answer
her
back
in
most
cutting
fashion
she
took
her
revenge
in
the
evening
by
giving
us
a
dish
of
sweets
for
dinner
that
i
did
not
like
i
began
to
look
better
for
the
change
and
although
still
very
religious
my
mysticism
was
growing
calmer
as
i
could
not
exist
however
without
a
passion
of
some
kind
i
began
to
get
very
fond
of
goats
and
i
asked
mamma
quite
seriously
whether
i
might
become
a
would
rather
you
were
that
than
a
nun
she
replied
and
then
she
added
will
talk
about
it
later
every
day
i
brought
down
with
me
from
the
mountain
another
little
kid
we
had
seven
of
them
when
my
mother
interfered
and
put
a
stop
to
my
zeal
finally
it
was
time
to
return
to
the
convent
my
holiday
was
over
and
i
was
quite
well
again
i
was
to
go
back
to
work
once
more
i
accepted
the
situation
willingly
to
the
great
surprise
of
mamma
who
loved
travelling
but
detested
the
actual
moving
from
one
place
to
another
i
was
delighted
at
the
idea
of
the
of
the
parcels
and
trunks
of
being
seated
in
things
that
moved
along
of
seeing
again
all
the
villages
towns
people
and
trees
which
changed
all
the
time
i
wanted
to
take
my
goats
with
me
but
my
mother
nearly
had
a
fit
are
mad
she
exclaimed
goats
in
a
train
and
in
a
carriage
where
could
you
put
them
no
a
hundred
times
no
she
finally
consented
to
my
taking
two
of
them
and
a
blackbird
that
one
of
the
mountaineers
had
given
me
and
so
we
returned
to
the
convent
i
was
received
there
with
such
sincere
joy
that
i
felt
very
happy
again
immediately
i
was
allowed
to
keep
my
two
goats
there
and
to
have
them
out
at
playtime
we
had
great
fun
with
them
they
used
to
butt
us
and
we
used
to
butt
them
and
we
laughed
frolicked
and
were
very
foolish
and
yet
i
was
nearly
fourteen
at
this
time
but
i
was
very
puny
and
childish
i
stayed
at
the
convent
another
ten
months
without
learning
anything
more
the
idea
of
becoming
a
nun
always
haunted
me
but
i
was
no
longer
mystic
my
godfather
looked
upon
me
as
the
greatest
dunce
of
a
child
i
worked
though
during
the
holidays
and
i
used
to
have
lessons
with
sophie
croizette
who
lived
near
to
our
country
house
this
gave
a
slight
impetus
to
me
in
my
studies
but
it
was
only
slight
sophie
was
very
gay
and
what
we
liked
best
was
to
go
to
the
museum
where
her
sister
pauline
who
was
later
on
to
become
madame
carolus
duran
was
copying
pictures
by
the
great
masters
pauline
was
as
cold
and
calm
as
sophie
was
charming
talkative
and
noisy
pauline
croizette
was
beautiful
but
i
liked
sophie
better
she
was
more
gracious
and
pretty
madame
croizette
their
mother
always
seemed
sad
and
resigned
she
had
given
up
her
career
very
early
she
had
been
a
dancer
at
the
opera
in
petersburg
and
had
been
very
much
adored
and
flattered
and
spoiled
i
fancy
it
was
the
birth
of
sophie
that
had
compelled
her
to
leave
the
stage
her
money
had
then
been
injudiciously
invested
and
she
had
been
ruined
she
was
very
her
face
had
a
kind
expression
there
was
an
infinite
melancholy
about
her
and
people
were
instinctively
drawn
towards
her
mamma
and
she
had
made
each
acquaintance
while
listening
to
the
music
in
the
park
at
versailles
and
for
some
time
we
saw
a
great
deal
of
one
another
sophie
and
i
had
some
fine
games
in
that
magnificent
park
our
greatest
joy
though
was
to
go
to
madame
in
the
rue
de
la
gare
madame
masson
had
a
curiosity
shop
her
daughter
cécile
was
a
perfect
little
beauty
we
three
used
to
delight
in
changing
the
tickets
on
the
vases
fans
and
jewels
and
then
when
poor
masson
came
back
with
a
rich
customer
for
masson
the
antiquary
enjoyed
a
reputation
sophie
and
i
used
to
hide
so
that
we
should
see
his
fury
cécile
with
an
innocent
air
would
be
helping
her
mother
and
glancing
slyly
at
us
from
time
to
time
the
whirl
of
life
separated
me
brusquely
from
all
these
people
whom
i
loved
and
an
incident
trivial
in
itself
caused
me
to
leave
the
convent
earlier
than
my
mother
wished
it
was
a
day
and
we
had
two
hours
for
recreation
we
were
marching
in
procession
along
the
wall
which
skirts
the
railway
on
the
left
bank
of
the
seine
and
as
we
were
burying
my
pet
lizard
we
were
chanting
the
about
twenty
of
my
little
playfellows
were
following
me
when
suddenly
a
shako
fell
at
my
feet
that
called
out
one
of
the
girls
it
come
from
over
the
wall
yes
listen
a
quarrel
going
on
we
were
suddenly
silent
listening
with
all
our
ears
be
stupid
idiotic
the
convent
am
i
to
get
my
shako
back
these
were
the
words
we
overheard
and
then
as
a
soldier
suddenly
appeared
astride
on
our
wall
there
were
shrieks
from
the
terrified
children
and
angry
exclamations
from
the
nuns
in
a
second
we
were
all
about
twenty
yards
away
from
the
wall
like
a
group
of
frightened
sparrows
flying
off
to
land
a
little
farther
away
inquisitive
and
very
much
on
the
alert
you
seen
my
shako
young
ladies
called
out
the
unfortunate
soldier
in
a
beseeching
tone
no
i
cried
hiding
it
behind
my
back
no
echoed
the
other
girls
with
peals
of
laughter
and
in
the
most
tormenting
insolent
jeering
way
we
continued
shouting
no
running
backwards
all
the
time
in
obedience
to
the
sisters
who
veiled
and
hidden
behind
the
trees
were
in
despair
we
were
only
a
few
yards
from
the
huge
gymnasium
i
climbed
up
breathless
at
full
speed
and
reached
the
wide
plank
at
the
top
when
there
i
unfastened
the
rope
ladder
but
as
i
could
not
raise
the
wooden
ladder
by
which
i
had
ascended
up
to
me
i
unfastened
the
rings
the
wooden
ladder
fell
and
broke
making
a
great
noise
i
then
stood
up
wickedly
triumphant
on
the
plank
calling
out
is
your
shako
but
you
get
it
now
i
put
it
on
my
head
and
walked
up
and
down
as
no
one
could
get
to
me
there
for
i
had
pulled
up
the
rope
ladder
i
suppose
my
first
idea
had
just
been
to
have
a
little
fun
but
the
girls
had
laughed
and
clapped
and
my
strength
had
held
out
better
than
i
had
hoped
so
that
my
head
was
turned
and
nothing
could
stop
me
then
the
young
soldier
was
furious
he
jumped
down
from
the
wall
and
rushed
in
my
direction
pushing
the
girls
out
of
his
way
the
sisters
beside
themselves
ran
to
the
house
calling
for
help
the
chaplain
the
mother
superior
father
larcher
and
every
one
else
came
running
out
i
believe
the
soldier
swore
like
a
trooper
and
it
was
really
quite
excusable
mother
sophie
from
below
besought
me
to
come
down
and
to
give
up
the
shako
the
soldier
tried
to
get
up
to
me
by
means
of
the
trapeze
and
the
gymnasium
rope
his
useless
efforts
delighted
all
the
pupils
whom
the
sisters
had
in
vain
tried
to
send
away
finally
the
sister
who
was
sounded
the
alarm
bell
and
five
minutes
later
the
soldiers
from
the
satory
barracks
arrived
thinking
that
a
fire
had
broken
out
when
the
officer
in
command
was
told
what
was
the
matter
he
sent
back
his
men
and
asked
to
see
the
mother
superior
he
was
brought
to
mother
sophie
whom
he
found
under
the
gymnasium
crying
with
shame
and
impotence
he
ordered
the
soldier
to
return
immediately
to
the
barracks
he
obeyed
after
clenching
his
fist
at
me
but
on
looking
up
he
could
not
help
laughing
his
shako
came
down
to
my
eyes
and
was
only
prevented
by
my
ears
which
were
bent
over
from
covering
my
face
i
was
furious
and
wildly
excited
with
the
turn
my
joke
had
taken
it
is
your
shako
i
called
out
and
i
flung
it
violently
over
the
wall
which
skirted
the
gymnasium
and
formed
the
boundary
to
the
cemetery
the
young
plague
muttered
the
officer
and
then
apologising
to
the
nuns
he
saluted
them
and
went
away
accompanied
by
father
larcher
as
for
me
i
felt
like
a
fox
with
its
tail
cut
i
refused
to
come
down
immediately
shall
come
down
when
every
one
has
gone
away
i
exclaimed
all
the
classes
received
punishments
i
was
left
alone
the
sun
had
set
the
silence
in
the
cemetery
terrified
me
the
dark
trees
took
mournful
or
threatening
shapes
the
moisture
from
the
wood
fell
like
a
mantle
over
my
shoulders
and
seemed
to
get
heavier
every
moment
i
felt
abandoned
by
every
one
and
i
began
to
cry
i
was
angry
with
myself
with
the
soldier
with
mother
sophie
with
the
pupils
who
had
excited
me
by
their
laughter
with
the
officer
who
had
humiliated
me
and
with
the
sister
who
had
sounded
the
alarm
bell
then
i
began
to
think
about
getting
down
the
rope
ladder
which
i
had
pulled
up
on
to
the
plank
very
clumsily
trembling
with
fear
at
the
least
sound
listening
eagerly
all
the
time
and
with
eyes
looking
to
the
right
and
left
i
was
an
enormous
time
and
was
very
much
afraid
of
unhooking
the
rings
finally
i
managed
to
unroll
it
and
i
was
just
about
to
put
my
foot
on
the
first
step
when
the
barking
of
césar
alarmed
me
he
was
tearing
along
from
the
wood
the
sight
of
the
dark
shadow
on
the
gymnasium
appeared
to
the
faithful
dog
to
bode
no
good
he
was
furious
and
began
to
scratch
the
thick
wooden
posts
césar
you
know
your
friend
i
said
very
gently
he
growled
in
reply
and
in
a
louder
voice
i
said
césar
bad
césar
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
fancy
barking
at
your
friend
he
now
began
to
howl
and
i
was
seized
with
terror
i
pulled
the
ladder
up
again
and
sat
down
at
the
top
césar
lay
down
under
the
gymnasium
his
tail
straight
out
his
ears
pricked
up
his
coat
bristling
growling
in
a
sullen
way
i
appealed
to
the
holy
virgin
to
help
me
i
prayed
fervently
vowed
to
say
three
supplementary
three
and
three
every
day
when
i
was
a
little
calmer
i
called
out
in
a
subdued
voice
my
dear
césar
my
beautiful
césar
you
know
i
am
the
angel
raphael
ah
much
césar
cared
for
him
he
considered
my
presence
alone
at
so
late
an
hour
in
the
garden
and
on
the
gymnasium
quite
incomprehensible
why
was
i
not
in
the
refectory
poor
césar
he
went
on
growling
and
i
was
getting
very
hungry
and
began
to
think
things
were
most
unjust
it
was
true
that
i
had
been
to
blame
for
taking
the
shako
but
after
all
he
had
commenced
why
had
he
thrown
his
shako
over
the
wall
my
imagination
now
came
to
my
aid
and
in
the
end
i
began
to
look
upon
myself
as
a
martyr
i
had
been
left
to
the
dog
and
he
would
eat
me
i
was
terrified
at
the
dead
people
behind
me
and
every
one
knew
i
was
very
nervous
my
chest
too
was
delicate
and
there
i
was
exposed
to
the
biting
cold
with
no
protection
whatever
i
began
to
think
about
mother
sophie
who
evidently
no
longer
cared
for
me
as
she
was
deserting
me
so
cruelly
i
lay
with
my
face
downwards
on
the
plank
and
gave
myself
up
to
the
wildest
despair
calling
my
mother
my
father
and
mother
sophie
sobbing
wishing
i
could
die
there
and
then
between
my
sobs
i
suddenly
heard
my
name
pronounced
by
a
voice
i
got
up
and
peering
through
the
gloom
caught
a
glimpse
of
my
beloved
mother
sophie
she
was
there
the
dear
saint
and
had
never
left
her
rebellious
child
concealed
behind
the
statue
of
augustine
she
had
been
praying
whilst
awaiting
the
end
of
this
crisis
which
in
her
simplicity
she
had
believed
might
prove
fatal
to
my
reason
and
perhaps
to
my
salvation
she
had
sent
every
one
away
and
remained
there
alone
and
she
too
had
not
dined
i
came
down
and
threw
myself
repentant
and
wretched
into
her
motherly
arms
she
did
not
say
a
word
to
me
about
the
horrible
incident
but
took
me
quickly
back
to
the
convent
i
was
all
damp
with
the
icy
evening
dew
my
cheeks
were
feverish
and
my
hands
and
feet
frozen
i
had
an
attack
of
pleurisy
after
this
and
was
days
between
life
and
death
mother
sophie
never
left
me
an
instant
the
sweet
mother
blamed
herself
for
my
illness
declaring
as
she
beat
her
breast
that
she
had
left
me
outside
too
long
my
fault
my
fault
she
kept
exclaiming
my
aunt
faure
came
to
see
me
nearly
every
day
my
mother
was
in
scotland
and
came
back
by
short
stages
my
aunt
rosine
was
at
ruining
the
whole
family
with
a
new
am
coming
i
am
coming
she
kept
saying
when
she
wrote
to
ask
how
i
was
despagne
and
monod
who
had
been
called
in
for
a
consultation
did
not
think
there
was
any
hope
baron
larrey
who
was
very
fond
of
me
came
often
he
had
a
certain
influence
over
me
and
i
willingly
obeyed
him
my
mother
arrived
a
short
time
before
my
convalescence
and
did
not
leave
me
again
as
soon
as
i
could
be
moved
she
took
me
to
paris
promising
to
send
me
back
to
the
convent
when
i
was
quite
well
it
was
for
ever
though
that
i
had
left
my
dear
convent
but
it
was
not
for
ever
that
i
left
mother
sophie
i
seemed
to
take
something
of
her
away
with
me
for
a
long
time
she
was
part
of
my
life
and
even
when
she
has
been
dead
for
years
she
haunts
my
mind
bringing
back
to
me
the
simple
thoughts
of
former
days
and
making
the
simple
flowers
of
yore
bloom
again
life
for
me
then
commenced
in
earnest
the
cloister
life
is
a
life
for
every
one
there
may
be
a
hundred
or
a
thousand
individuals
there
but
every
one
lives
a
life
which
is
the
same
and
the
only
life
for
all
the
rumour
of
the
outside
world
dies
away
at
the
heavy
cloister
gate
the
sole
ambition
is
to
sing
more
loudly
than
the
others
at
vespers
to
take
a
little
more
of
the
form
to
be
at
the
end
of
the
table
to
be
on
the
list
of
honour
when
i
was
told
that
i
was
not
to
go
back
to
the
convent
it
was
to
me
as
though
i
was
to
be
thrown
into
the
sea
when
i
could
not
swim
i
besought
my
godfather
to
let
me
go
back
to
the
convent
the
dowry
left
to
me
by
my
father
was
ample
enough
for
the
dowry
of
a
nun
i
wanted
to
take
the
veil
well
replied
my
godfather
can
take
the
veil
in
two
time
but
not
before
in
the
meantime
learn
all
that
you
do
not
yet
know
and
that
means
everything
from
the
governess
your
mother
has
chosen
for
that
very
day
an
elderly
unmarried
lady
with
soft
grey
gentle
eyes
came
and
took
possession
of
my
life
my
mind
and
my
conscience
for
eight
hours
every
day
her
name
was
mlle
de
brabender
and
she
had
educated
a
grand
duchess
in
russia
she
had
a
sweet
voice
an
enormous
sandy
moustache
a
grotesque
nose
but
a
way
of
walking
of
expressing
herself
and
of
bowing
which
simply
commanded
deference
she
lived
at
the
convent
in
the
rue
notre
dame
des
champs
and
this
was
why
in
spite
of
my
entreaties
she
refused
to
come
and
remain
with
us
she
soon
won
my
affection
and
i
learnt
quite
easily
with
her
everything
that
she
wanted
me
to
learn
i
worked
eagerly
for
my
dream
was
to
return
to
the
convent
not
as
a
pupil
but
as
a
teaching
sister
vi
the
family
council
and
my
first
visit
to
a
theatre
i
arose
one
september
morning
my
heart
leaping
with
some
remote
joy
it
was
eight
i
pressed
my
forehead
against
the
and
gazed
out
looking
at
i
know
not
what
i
had
been
roused
with
a
start
in
the
midst
of
some
fine
dream
and
i
had
rushed
towards
the
light
in
the
hope
of
finding
in
the
infinite
space
of
the
grey
sky
the
luminous
point
that
would
explain
my
anxious
and
blissful
expectation
expectation
of
what
i
could
not
have
answered
that
question
then
any
more
than
i
can
now
after
much
reflection
i
was
on
the
eve
of
my
fifteenth
birthday
and
i
was
in
a
state
of
expectation
as
to
the
future
of
my
life
that
particular
morning
seemed
to
me
to
be
the
precursor
of
a
new
era
i
was
not
mistaken
for
on
that
september
day
my
fate
was
settled
for
me
hypnotised
by
what
was
taking
place
in
my
mind
i
remained
with
my
forehead
pressed
against
the
gazing
through
the
halo
of
vapour
formed
by
my
breath
at
houses
palaces
carriages
jewels
and
pearls
passing
along
in
front
of
me
oh
what
a
number
of
pearls
there
were
there
were
princes
and
kings
too
yes
i
could
even
see
kings
oh
how
fast
imagination
travels
and
its
enemy
reason
always
allows
it
to
roam
on
alone
in
my
fancy
i
proudly
rejected
the
princes
i
rejected
the
kings
refused
the
pearls
and
the
palaces
and
declared
that
i
was
going
to
be
a
nun
for
in
the
infinite
grey
sky
i
had
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
convent
of
of
my
white
and
of
the
small
lamp
that
swung
to
and
fro
above
the
little
virgin
all
decorated
with
flowers
by
us
the
king
offered
me
a
throne
but
i
preferred
the
throne
of
our
mother
superior
and
i
entertained
a
vague
ambition
to
occupy
it
some
day
in
the
distant
future
the
king
was
and
dying
of
despair
yes
i
preferred
to
the
pearls
that
were
offered
me
by
princes
the
pearls
of
the
rosary
i
was
telling
with
my
fingers
and
no
costume
could
compete
in
my
mind
with
the
black
barège
veil
that
fell
like
a
soft
shadow
over
the
cambric
that
encircled
the
beloved
faces
of
the
nuns
of
i
do
not
know
how
long
i
had
been
dreaming
thus
when
i
heard
my
voice
asking
our
old
servant
marguerite
if
i
were
awake
with
one
bound
i
was
back
in
bed
and
i
buried
my
face
under
the
sheet
mamma
half
opened
the
door
very
gently
and
i
pretended
to
wake
up
lazy
you
are
she
said
i
kissed
her
and
answered
in
a
coaxing
tone
is
thursday
and
i
have
no
music
are
you
glad
she
asked
yes
i
replied
promptly
my
mother
frowned
she
adored
music
and
i
hated
the
piano
she
was
so
fond
of
music
that
although
she
was
then
nearly
thirty
she
took
lessons
herself
in
order
to
encourage
me
to
practise
what
horrible
torture
it
was
i
used
very
wickedly
to
do
my
utmost
to
set
my
mother
and
my
music
mistress
at
variance
they
were
both
of
them
as
as
possible
when
my
mother
had
practised
a
new
piece
three
or
four
days
she
knew
it
by
heart
and
played
it
fairly
well
to
the
astonishment
of
mlle
clarisse
my
insufferable
old
teacher
who
held
the
music
in
her
hand
and
read
every
note
with
her
nose
nearly
touching
the
page
one
day
i
heard
with
joy
a
quarrel
beginning
between
mamma
and
this
disagreeable
mlle
clarisse
a
quaver
no
quaver
is
a
flat
you
forget
the
sharp
how
absurd
you
are
mademoiselle
added
my
mother
perfectly
furious
a
few
minutes
later
my
mother
went
to
her
room
and
mlle
clarisse
departed
muttering
as
she
left
as
for
me
i
was
choking
with
laughter
in
my
for
one
of
my
cousins
who
was
a
good
musician
had
helped
me
to
add
sharps
flats
and
quavers
and
we
had
done
it
with
such
care
that
even
a
trained
eye
would
have
had
difficulty
in
discerning
the
fraud
immediately
as
mlle
clarisse
had
been
sent
off
i
had
no
lesson
that
day
mamma
gazed
at
me
a
long
time
with
her
mysterious
eyes
the
most
beautiful
eyes
i
have
ever
seen
in
my
life
and
then
she
said
speaking
very
slowly
luncheon
there
is
to
be
a
family
i
felt
myself
turning
pale
right
i
answered
frock
am
i
to
put
on
mamma
i
said
this
merely
for
the
sake
of
saying
something
and
to
keep
myself
from
crying
your
blue
silk
on
you
look
more
staid
in
just
at
this
moment
my
sister
jeanne
opened
the
door
boisterously
and
with
a
burst
of
laughter
jumped
on
to
my
bed
and
slipping
under
the
sheets
called
out
there
marguerite
had
followed
her
into
the
room
panting
and
scolding
the
child
had
escaped
from
her
just
as
she
was
about
to
bathe
her
and
had
announced
going
into
my
mirth
at
this
moment
which
i
felt
was
a
very
serious
one
for
me
made
me
burst
out
crying
and
sobbing
my
mother
not
understanding
the
reason
of
this
grief
shrugged
her
shoulders
told
marguerite
to
fetch
slippers
and
taking
the
little
bare
feet
in
her
hands
kissed
them
tenderly
i
sobbed
more
bitterly
than
ever
it
was
very
evident
that
mamma
loved
my
sister
more
than
me
and
this
preference
which
did
not
trouble
me
in
an
ordinary
way
hurt
me
sorely
now
mamma
went
away
quite
out
of
patience
with
me
i
fell
asleep
in
order
to
forget
and
was
roused
by
marguerite
who
helped
me
to
dress
as
otherwise
i
should
have
been
late
for
luncheon
the
guests
that
day
were
aunt
rosine
mlle
de
brabender
my
governess
a
charming
creature
whom
i
have
always
regretted
my
godfather
and
the
duc
de
morny
a
great
friend
of
my
godfather
and
of
my
mother
the
luncheon
was
a
mournful
meal
for
me
as
i
was
thinking
all
the
time
about
the
family
council
mlle
de
brabender
in
her
gentle
way
and
with
her
affectionate
words
insisted
on
my
eating
my
sister
burst
out
laughing
when
she
looked
at
me
eyes
are
as
little
as
that
she
said
putting
her
small
thumb
on
the
tip
of
her
forefinger
it
serves
you
right
because
been
crying
and
mamma
like
any
one
to
cry
do
you
mamma
have
you
been
crying
about
asked
the
duc
de
morny
i
did
not
answer
in
spite
of
the
friendly
nudge
mlle
de
brabender
gave
me
with
her
sharp
elbow
the
duc
de
morny
always
awed
me
a
little
he
was
gentle
and
kind
but
he
was
a
great
quiz
i
knew
too
that
he
occupied
a
high
place
at
court
and
that
my
family
considered
his
friendship
a
great
honour
i
told
her
that
after
luncheon
there
was
to
be
a
family
council
on
her
behalf
said
my
mother
speaking
slowly
times
it
seems
to
me
that
she
is
quite
idiotic
she
quite
disheartens
come
exclaimed
my
godfather
and
aunt
rosine
said
something
in
english
to
the
duc
de
morny
which
made
him
smile
shrewdly
under
his
thin
moustache
mlle
de
brabender
scolded
me
in
a
low
voice
and
her
scoldings
were
like
words
from
heaven
when
at
last
luncheon
was
over
mamma
told
me
as
she
passed
to
pour
out
the
coffee
marguerite
helped
me
to
arrange
the
cups
and
i
went
into
the
maître
c
the
notary
from
havre
whom
i
detested
was
already
there
he
represented
the
family
of
my
father
who
had
died
at
pisa
in
a
way
which
had
never
been
explained
but
which
seemed
mysterious
my
childish
hatred
was
instinctive
and
i
learnt
later
on
that
this
man
had
been
my
bitter
enemy
he
was
very
very
ugly
this
notary
his
whole
face
seemed
to
have
moved
up
higher
it
was
as
though
he
had
been
hanging
by
his
hair
for
a
long
time
and
his
eyes
his
mouth
his
cheeks
and
his
nose
had
got
into
the
habit
of
trying
to
reach
the
back
of
his
head
he
ought
to
have
had
a
joyful
expression
as
so
many
of
his
features
turned
up
but
instead
of
this
his
face
was
smooth
and
he
had
red
hair
planted
in
his
head
like
couch
grass
and
on
his
nose
he
wore
a
pair
of
spectacles
oh
the
horrible
man
what
a
torturing
nightmare
the
very
memory
of
him
is
for
he
was
the
evil
genius
of
my
father
and
his
hatred
now
pursued
me
my
poor
grandmother
since
the
death
of
my
father
never
went
out
but
spent
her
time
mourning
the
loss
of
her
beloved
son
who
had
died
so
young
she
had
absolute
faith
in
this
man
who
besides
was
the
executor
of
my
will
he
had
the
control
of
the
money
that
my
dear
father
had
left
me
i
was
not
to
receive
it
until
the
day
of
my
marriage
but
my
mother
was
to
use
the
interest
for
my
education
my
uncle
felix
faure
was
also
there
seated
near
the
fireplace
buried
in
an
meydieu
pulled
out
his
watch
in
a
querulous
way
he
was
an
old
friend
of
the
family
and
he
always
called
me
which
annoyed
me
greatly
as
did
his
familiarity
he
considered
me
stupid
and
when
i
handed
him
his
coffee
he
said
in
a
jeering
tone
it
is
for
you
that
so
many
honest
people
have
been
hindered
in
their
work
we
have
plenty
of
other
things
to
attend
to
i
can
assure
you
than
to
discuss
the
fate
of
a
little
brat
like
you
ah
if
it
had
been
her
sister
there
would
have
been
no
difficulty
and
with
his
benumbed
fingers
he
patted
head
as
she
remained
on
the
floor
plaiting
the
fringe
of
the
sofa
upon
which
he
was
seated
when
the
coffee
had
been
drunk
the
cups
carried
away
and
my
sister
also
there
was
a
short
silence
the
duc
de
morny
rose
to
take
his
leave
but
my
mother
begged
him
to
stay
will
be
able
to
advise
us
she
urged
and
the
duc
took
his
seat
again
near
my
aunt
with
whom
it
seemed
to
me
he
was
carrying
on
a
slight
flirtation
mamma
had
moved
nearer
to
the
window
her
embroidery
frame
in
front
of
her
and
her
beautiful
profile
showing
to
advantage
against
the
light
she
looked
as
though
she
had
nothing
to
do
with
what
was
about
to
be
discussed
the
hideous
notary
had
risen
my
uncle
had
drawn
me
near
to
him
my
godfather
régis
seemed
to
be
the
exact
counterpart
of
meydieu
they
both
of
them
had
the
same
mind
and
were
equally
stubborn
and
obstinate
they
were
both
devoted
to
whist
and
good
wine
and
they
both
agreed
that
i
was
thin
enough
for
a
scarecrow
the
door
opened
and
a
pale
woman
entered
a
most
and
charming
creature
it
was
madame
guérard
lady
of
the
upstairs
flat
as
marguerite
always
called
her
my
mother
had
made
friends
with
her
in
rather
a
patronising
way
certainly
but
madame
guérard
was
devoted
to
me
and
endured
the
little
slights
to
which
she
was
treated
very
patiently
for
my
sake
she
was
tall
and
slender
as
a
lath
very
compliant
and
demure
she
lived
in
the
flat
above
and
had
come
down
without
a
hat
she
was
wearing
an
indoor
gown
of
indienne
with
a
design
of
little
brown
leaves
meydieu
muttered
something
i
did
not
catch
what
the
abominable
notary
made
a
very
curt
bow
to
madame
guérard
the
duc
de
morny
was
very
gracious
for
the
was
so
pretty
my
godfather
merely
bent
his
head
as
madame
guérard
was
nothing
to
him
aunt
rosine
glanced
at
her
from
head
to
foot
mlle
de
brabender
shook
hands
cordially
with
her
for
madame
guérard
was
fond
of
me
my
uncle
félix
faure
gave
her
a
chair
and
asked
her
to
sit
down
and
then
inquired
in
a
kindly
nay
about
her
husband
a
with
whom
my
uncle
collaborated
sometimes
for
his
book
life
of
mamma
had
merely
glanced
across
the
room
without
raising
her
head
for
madame
guérard
did
not
prefer
my
sister
to
me
as
we
have
come
here
on
account
of
this
child
said
my
godfather
looking
at
his
watch
must
begin
and
discuss
what
is
to
be
done
with
i
began
to
tremble
and
drew
closer
to
mon
petit
dame
as
i
had
always
called
madame
guérard
from
my
infancy
and
to
mlle
de
brabender
they
each
took
my
hand
by
way
of
encouraging
me
continued
meydieu
with
a
laugh
appears
you
want
to
be
a
indeed
said
the
duc
de
morny
to
aunt
rosine
she
retorted
with
a
laugh
mamma
sighed
and
held
her
wools
up
close
to
her
eyes
to
match
them
have
to
be
rich
though
to
enter
a
convent
grunted
the
havre
notary
you
have
not
a
i
leaned
towards
mlle
de
brabender
and
whispered
have
the
money
that
papa
the
horrid
man
overheard
father
left
some
money
to
get
you
married
he
said
then
marry
the
i
answered
and
my
voice
was
quite
resolute
now
i
turned
very
red
and
for
the
second
time
in
my
life
i
felt
a
desire
and
a
strong
inclination
to
fight
for
myself
i
had
no
more
fear
as
every
one
had
gone
too
far
and
provoked
me
too
much
i
slipped
away
from
my
two
kind
friends
and
advanced
towards
the
other
group
will
be
a
nun
i
will
i
exclaimed
know
that
papa
left
me
some
money
so
that
i
should
be
married
and
i
know
that
the
nuns
marry
the
saviour
mamma
says
she
does
not
care
it
is
all
the
same
to
her
so
that
it
be
vexing
her
at
all
and
they
love
me
better
at
the
convent
than
you
do
here
dear
child
said
my
uncle
drawing
me
towards
him
religious
vocation
appears
to
me
to
be
more
a
wish
to
love
to
be
loved
murmured
madame
guérard
in
a
very
low
voice
every
one
glanced
at
mamma
who
shrugged
her
shoulders
lightly
it
seemed
to
me
as
though
the
glance
they
all
gave
her
was
a
reproachful
one
and
i
felt
a
pang
of
remorse
at
once
i
went
across
to
her
and
throwing
my
arms
round
her
neck
said
mind
my
being
a
nun
do
you
it
make
you
unhappy
will
it
mamma
stroked
my
hair
of
which
she
was
very
proud
it
would
make
me
unhappy
you
know
very
well
that
after
your
sister
i
love
you
better
than
any
one
else
in
the
she
said
this
very
slowly
in
a
gentle
voice
it
was
like
the
sound
of
a
little
waterfall
as
it
flows
down
babbling
and
clear
from
the
mountain
dragging
with
it
the
gravel
and
gradually
increasing
in
volume
with
the
thawed
snow
until
it
sweeps
along
rocks
and
trees
in
its
course
this
was
the
effect
my
clear
drawling
voice
had
upon
me
at
that
moment
i
rushed
back
impulsively
to
the
others
who
were
all
speechless
at
this
unexpected
and
spontaneous
burst
of
eloquence
i
went
from
one
to
the
other
explaining
my
decision
and
giving
reasons
which
were
certainly
no
reasons
at
all
i
did
my
utmost
to
get
someone
to
support
me
in
the
matter
finally
the
duc
de
morny
was
bored
and
rose
to
go
you
know
what
you
ought
to
do
with
this
child
he
said
ought
to
send
her
to
the
he
then
patted
my
cheek
kissed
my
hand
and
bowed
to
all
the
others
as
he
bent
over
my
hand
i
heard
him
say
to
her
would
have
made
a
bad
diplomatist
but
follow
my
advice
and
send
her
to
the
he
then
took
his
departure
and
i
gazed
at
every
one
in
perfect
anguish
the
conservatoire
what
was
it
what
did
it
mean
i
went
up
to
my
governess
mlle
de
brabender
her
lips
were
firmly
pressed
together
and
she
looked
shocked
just
as
she
did
sometimes
when
my
godfather
told
some
story
that
she
did
not
approve
at
table
my
uncle
felix
faure
was
gazing
at
the
floor
in
an
way
the
notary
had
a
spiteful
look
in
his
eyes
my
aunt
was
holding
forth
in
a
very
excited
manner
and
meydieu
kept
shaking
his
head
and
muttering
yes
who
knows
hum
hum
madame
guérard
was
very
pale
and
sad
and
she
looked
at
me
with
infinite
tenderness
what
could
this
conservatoire
be
the
word
uttered
so
carelessly
seemed
to
have
entirely
disturbed
the
equanimity
of
all
present
each
one
of
them
seemed
to
me
to
have
a
different
impression
about
it
but
none
looked
pleased
suddenly
in
the
midst
of
the
general
embarrassment
my
godfather
exclaimed
brutally
is
too
thin
to
make
an
be
an
actress
i
exclaimed
know
what
an
actress
is
said
my
aunt
yes
i
do
rachel
is
an
know
rachel
asked
mamma
getting
up
yes
she
came
to
the
convent
once
to
see
little
adèle
sarony
she
went
all
over
the
convent
and
into
the
garden
and
she
had
to
sit
down
because
she
could
not
get
her
breath
they
fetched
her
something
to
bring
her
round
and
she
was
so
pale
oh
so
pale
i
was
very
sorry
for
her
and
sister
appoline
told
me
what
she
did
was
killing
her
for
she
was
an
actress
and
so
i
be
an
actress
i
i
had
said
all
this
in
a
breath
with
my
cheeks
on
fire
and
my
voice
hard
i
remembered
all
that
sister
appoline
had
told
me
and
mother
sophie
too
i
remembered
also
that
when
rachel
had
gone
out
of
the
garden
looking
very
pale
and
holding
a
arm
for
support
a
little
girl
had
put
her
tongue
out
at
her
i
did
not
want
people
to
put
out
their
tongues
at
me
when
i
was
grown
up
conservatoire
that
word
alarmed
me
he
wanted
me
to
be
an
actress
and
he
had
now
gone
away
so
that
i
could
not
talk
things
over
with
him
he
went
away
smiling
and
tranquil
after
caressing
me
in
the
usual
friendly
way
he
had
gone
caring
little
about
the
scraggy
child
whose
future
had
been
discussed
her
to
the
conservatoire
and
that
sentence
uttered
carelessly
had
come
like
a
bomb
into
my
life
i
the
dreamy
child
who
that
morning
was
ready
to
repulse
princes
and
kings
i
whose
trembling
fingers
had
that
morning
told
over
chaplets
of
dreams
who
only
a
few
hours
ago
had
felt
my
heart
beating
with
emotion
hitherto
unknown
to
me
i
who
had
got
up
expecting
some
great
event
to
take
place
was
to
see
everything
disappear
thanks
to
that
phrase
as
heavy
as
lead
and
as
deadly
as
a
bullet
her
to
the
conservatoire
and
i
divined
that
this
phrase
was
to
be
the
of
my
life
all
those
people
had
gathered
together
at
the
turning
of
the
cross
roads
her
to
the
conservatoire
i
wanted
to
be
a
nun
and
this
was
considered
absurd
idiotic
unreasonable
her
to
the
conservatoire
had
opened
out
a
field
for
discussion
the
horizon
of
a
future
my
uncle
félix
faure
and
mlle
brabender
were
the
only
ones
against
this
idea
they
tried
in
vain
to
make
my
mother
understand
that
with
the
francs
that
my
father
had
left
me
i
might
marry
but
mother
replied
that
i
had
declared
i
had
a
horror
of
marriage
and
that
i
should
wait
until
i
was
of
age
to
go
into
a
convent
these
conditions
she
said
will
never
have
her
certainly
not
put
in
the
notary
continued
my
mother
would
enter
the
convent
as
a
servant
and
i
will
not
have
that
my
money
is
an
annuity
so
that
i
can
not
leave
anything
to
my
children
i
therefore
want
them
to
have
a
career
of
their
my
mother
was
now
exhausted
with
so
much
talking
and
lay
back
in
an
i
got
very
much
excited
and
my
mother
asked
me
to
go
away
mlle
de
brabender
and
madame
guérard
were
arguing
in
a
low
voice
and
i
thought
of
the
aristocratic
man
who
had
just
left
us
i
was
very
angry
with
him
for
this
idea
of
the
conservatoire
was
his
mlle
de
brabender
tried
to
console
me
madame
guérard
said
that
this
career
had
its
advantages
mlle
de
brabender
considered
that
the
convent
would
have
a
great
fascination
for
so
dreamy
a
nature
as
mine
the
latter
was
very
religious
and
a
great
petit
was
a
pagan
in
the
purest
acceptation
of
that
word
and
yet
the
two
women
got
on
very
well
together
thanks
to
their
affectionate
devotion
to
me
madame
guérard
adored
the
proud
rebelliousness
of
my
nature
my
pretty
face
and
the
slenderness
of
my
figure
mlle
de
brabender
was
touched
by
my
delicate
health
she
endeavoured
to
comfort
me
when
i
was
jealous
at
not
being
loved
as
much
as
my
sister
but
what
she
liked
best
about
me
was
my
voice
she
always
declared
that
my
voice
was
modulated
for
prayers
and
my
delight
in
the
convent
appeared
to
her
quite
natural
she
loved
me
with
a
gentle
pious
affection
and
madame
guérard
loved
me
with
bursts
of
paganism
these
two
women
whose
memory
is
still
dear
to
me
shared
me
between
them
and
made
the
best
of
my
good
qualities
and
my
faults
i
certainly
owe
to
both
of
them
this
study
of
myself
and
the
vision
i
have
of
myself
the
day
was
destined
to
end
in
the
strangest
of
fashions
madame
guérard
had
gone
back
to
her
apartment
upstairs
and
i
was
lying
back
on
a
little
cane
which
was
the
most
ornamental
piece
of
furniture
in
my
room
i
felt
very
drowsy
and
was
holding
mlle
de
hand
in
mine
when
the
door
opened
and
my
aunt
entered
followed
by
my
mother
i
can
see
them
now
my
aunt
in
her
dress
of
puce
silk
trimmed
with
fur
her
brown
velvet
hat
tied
under
her
chin
with
long
wide
strings
and
mamma
who
had
taken
off
her
dress
and
put
on
a
white
woollen
she
always
detested
keeping
on
her
dress
in
the
house
and
i
understood
by
her
change
of
costume
that
every
one
had
gone
and
that
my
aunt
was
ready
to
leave
i
got
up
from
my
but
mamma
made
me
sit
down
again
yourself
thoroughly
she
said
we
are
going
to
take
you
to
the
theatre
this
evening
to
the
i
felt
sure
that
this
was
just
a
bait
and
i
would
not
show
any
sign
of
pleasure
although
in
my
heart
i
was
delighted
at
the
idea
of
going
to
the
français
the
only
theatre
i
knew
anything
of
was
the
robert
houdin
to
which
i
was
taken
sometimes
with
my
sister
and
i
fancy
that
it
was
for
her
benefit
we
went
as
i
was
really
too
old
to
care
for
that
kind
of
performance
you
come
with
us
mamma
said
turning
to
mlle
de
brabender
madame
replied
this
dear
creature
will
go
home
and
change
my
my
aunt
laughed
at
my
sullen
looks
fraud
she
said
as
she
went
away
are
hiding
your
delight
ah
well
you
will
see
some
actresses
rachel
going
to
act
i
asked
no
she
is
my
aunt
kissed
me
and
went
away
saying
she
should
see
me
again
later
on
and
my
mother
followed
her
out
of
the
room
mlle
de
brabender
then
hurriedly
prepared
to
leave
me
she
had
to
go
home
to
dress
and
to
say
that
she
would
not
be
in
until
quite
late
for
in
her
convent
special
permission
had
to
be
obtained
when
one
wished
to
be
out
later
than
ten
at
night
when
i
was
alone
i
swung
myself
backwards
and
forwards
in
my
which
by
the
way
was
anything
but
a
i
began
to
think
and
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
my
critical
comprehension
came
to
my
aid
and
so
all
these
serious
people
had
been
inconvenienced
the
notary
fetched
from
hâvre
my
uncle
dragged
away
from
working
at
his
book
the
old
bachelor
meydieu
disturbed
in
his
habits
and
customs
my
godfather
kept
away
from
the
stock
exchange
and
that
aristocratic
and
sceptical
duc
de
morny
cramped
up
for
two
hours
in
the
midst
of
our
surroundings
and
all
to
end
in
this
decision
shall
be
taken
to
the
i
do
not
know
what
part
my
uncle
had
played
in
this
burlesque
plan
but
i
doubt
whether
it
was
to
his
taste
all
the
same
i
was
glad
to
go
to
the
theatre
it
made
me
feel
more
important
that
morning
on
waking
up
i
was
quite
a
child
and
now
events
had
taken
place
which
had
transformed
me
into
a
young
girl
i
had
been
discussed
by
every
one
and
i
had
expressed
my
wishes
without
any
result
certainly
but
all
the
same
i
had
expressed
them
and
now
it
was
deemed
necessary
to
humour
and
indulge
me
in
order
to
win
me
over
they
could
not
force
me
into
agreeing
to
what
they
wanted
me
to
do
my
consent
was
necessary
and
i
felt
so
joyful
and
so
proud
about
it
that
i
was
quite
touched
and
almost
ready
to
yield
i
said
to
myself
that
it
would
be
better
to
hold
my
own
and
let
them
ask
me
again
after
dinner
we
all
squeezed
into
a
cab
mamma
my
godfather
mlle
de
brabender
and
i
my
godfather
made
me
a
present
of
some
white
gloves
on
mounting
the
steps
at
the
théâtre
français
i
trod
on
a
dress
she
turned
round
and
called
me
a
i
moved
back
hastily
and
came
into
collision
with
a
very
stout
old
gentleman
who
gave
me
a
rough
push
forward
when
once
we
were
all
installed
in
a
box
facing
the
stage
mamma
and
i
in
the
first
row
with
mlle
de
brabender
behind
me
i
felt
more
reassured
i
was
close
against
the
partition
of
the
box
and
i
could
feel
mlle
de
sharp
knees
through
the
velvet
of
my
chair
this
gave
me
confidence
and
i
leaned
against
the
back
of
the
chair
purposely
to
feel
the
support
of
those
two
knees
when
the
curtain
slowly
rose
i
thought
i
should
have
fainted
it
was
as
though
the
curtain
of
my
future
life
were
being
raised
these
columns
was
being
played
were
to
be
my
palaces
the
borders
above
were
to
be
my
skies
and
those
boards
were
to
bend
under
my
frail
weight
i
heard
nothing
of
for
i
was
far
far
away
at
in
my
dormitory
there
what
do
you
think
of
it
asked
my
godfather
when
the
curtain
fell
i
did
not
answer
and
he
laid
his
hand
on
my
head
and
turned
my
face
round
towards
him
i
was
crying
and
big
tears
were
rolling
slowly
down
my
cheeks
those
tears
that
come
without
any
sobs
and
without
any
hope
of
ever
ceasing
my
godfather
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
getting
up
left
the
box
banging
the
door
after
him
mamma
losing
all
patience
with
me
proceeded
to
review
the
house
through
her
mlle
de
brabender
passed
me
her
handkerchief
for
i
had
dropped
mine
and
dared
not
pick
it
up
the
curtain
had
been
raised
for
the
second
piece
and
i
made
an
effort
to
listen
for
the
sake
of
pleasing
my
governess
who
was
so
gentle
and
conciliating
i
can
only
remember
one
thing
and
that
is
that
alcmène
seemed
to
be
so
unhappy
that
i
burst
into
loud
sobs
and
that
the
whole
house
very
much
amused
looked
at
our
box
my
mother
greatly
annoyed
took
me
out
and
mlle
de
brabender
went
with
us
my
godfather
was
furious
and
muttered
ought
to
be
shut
up
in
a
convent
and
left
there
good
heavens
what
a
little
idiot
the
child
is
this
was
the
of
my
artistic
career
vii
my
career
first
lessons
i
was
beginning
to
think
though
of
my
new
career
books
were
sent
to
me
from
all
quarters
racine
corneille
molière
casimir
delavigne
i
opened
them
but
as
i
did
not
understand
them
at
all
i
quickly
closed
them
again
and
read
my
little
lafontaine
which
i
loved
passionately
i
knew
all
his
fables
and
one
of
my
delights
was
to
make
a
bet
with
my
godfather
or
with
meydieu
our
learned
and
tiresome
friend
i
used
to
bet
that
they
would
not
recognise
all
the
fables
if
i
began
with
the
last
verse
and
went
backwards
to
the
first
one
and
i
often
won
the
bet
a
line
from
my
aunt
arrived
one
day
telling
my
mother
that
auber
who
was
then
director
of
the
conservatoire
was
expecting
us
the
next
day
at
nine
in
the
morning
i
was
about
to
put
my
foot
in
the
stirrup
my
mother
sent
me
with
madame
guérard
auber
received
us
very
affably
as
the
duc
de
morny
had
spoken
to
him
of
me
i
was
very
much
impressed
by
him
with
his
refined
face
and
white
hair
his
ivory
complexion
and
magnificent
black
eyes
his
fragile
and
distinguished
look
his
melodious
voice
and
the
celebrity
of
his
name
i
scarcely
dared
answer
his
questions
he
spoke
to
me
very
gently
and
told
me
to
sit
down
are
very
fond
of
the
stage
he
began
no
monsieur
i
answered
this
unexpected
reply
amazed
him
he
looked
at
madame
guérard
from
under
his
heavy
eyelids
and
she
at
once
said
she
does
not
care
for
the
stage
but
she
does
not
want
to
marry
and
consequently
she
will
have
no
money
as
her
father
left
her
a
hundred
thousand
francs
which
she
can
only
get
on
her
her
mother
therefore
wants
her
to
have
some
profession
for
madame
bernhardt
has
only
an
annuity
a
fairly
good
one
but
it
is
only
an
annuity
and
so
she
will
not
be
able
to
leave
her
daughters
anything
on
that
account
she
wants
sarah
to
become
independent
she
would
like
to
enter
a
that
is
not
an
independent
career
my
child
said
auber
slowly
old
is
she
he
asked
and
a
half
replied
madame
guérard
i
exclaimed
am
nearly
the
kind
old
man
smiled
twenty
years
from
now
he
said
will
insist
less
upon
the
exact
figures
and
evidently
thinking
the
visit
had
lasted
long
enough
he
rose
appears
he
said
to
madame
guérard
this
little
mother
is
very
beautiful
very
beautiful
she
replied
will
please
express
my
regret
to
her
that
i
have
not
seen
her
and
my
thanks
for
her
having
been
so
charmingly
he
thereupon
kissed
madame
hand
and
she
coloured
slightly
this
conversation
remained
engraved
on
my
mind
i
remember
every
word
of
it
every
movement
and
every
gesture
of
for
this
little
man
so
charming
and
so
gentle
held
my
future
in
his
hand
he
opened
the
door
for
us
and
touching
me
on
my
shoulder
said
courage
little
girl
believe
me
you
will
thank
your
mother
some
day
for
driving
you
to
it
look
so
sad
life
is
well
worth
beginning
seriously
but
i
stammered
out
a
few
words
of
thanks
and
just
as
i
was
making
my
exit
a
woman
knocked
against
me
she
was
heavy
and
extremely
bustling
though
and
auber
bent
his
head
towards
me
and
said
quietly
all
things
let
yourself
get
stout
like
this
singer
stoutness
is
the
enemy
of
a
woman
and
of
an
the
was
now
holding
the
door
open
for
us
and
as
auber
returned
to
his
visitor
i
heard
him
say
most
ideal
of
women
i
went
away
rather
astounded
and
did
not
say
a
word
in
the
carriage
madame
guérard
told
my
mother
about
our
interview
but
she
did
not
even
let
her
finish
and
only
said
good
thank
as
the
examination
was
to
take
place
a
month
after
this
visit
it
became
necessary
to
prepare
for
it
my
mother
did
not
know
any
theatrical
people
my
godfather
advised
me
to
learn
but
mlle
de
brabender
objected
as
she
thought
it
a
little
offensive
and
refused
to
help
me
if
i
chose
that
meydieu
our
old
friend
wanted
me
to
work
at
chimène
in
but
first
he
declared
that
i
clenched
my
teeth
too
much
for
it
it
was
quite
true
that
i
did
not
make
the
open
enough
and
did
not
roll
the
sufficiently
either
he
wrote
a
little
for
me
which
i
am
copying
textually
as
my
poor
dear
guérard
religiously
kept
everything
concerning
me
and
she
gave
me
later
on
a
quantity
of
papers
which
are
useful
now
the
following
is
our
odious
work

instead
of

he
gave
this
piece
of
work
quite
seriously
to
mlle
de
brabender
who
quite
seriously
wanted
me
to
practise
it
my
governess
was
charming
and
i
was
very
fond
of
her
but
i
could
not
help
yelling
with
laughter
when
after
making
me
go
through
the
de
exercise
which
went
fairly
well
and
then
the
gros
she
started
on
the
sausages
ah
no
there
was
a
cacophony
of
hisses
in
her
toothless
mouth
enough
to
make
all
the
dogs
in
paris
howl
and
when
she
began
with
the
accompanied
by
the
petit
i
thought
my
dear
governess
was
losing
her
reason
she
half
closed
her
eyes
her
face
was
red
her
moustache
bristled
up
she
put
on
a
sententious
hurried
manner
her
mouth
widened
out
and
looked
like
the
slit
in
a
or
else
it
was
creased
up
into
a
little
ring
and
she
purred
and
hissed
and
chirped
and
fooled
without
ceasing
i
flung
myself
exhausted
into
my
wicker
chair
choking
with
laughter
and
great
tears
poured
from
my
eyes
i
stamped
on
the
floor
flung
my
arms
out
right
and
left
until
they
were
tired
and
rocked
myself
backwards
and
forwards
pealing
with
laughter
my
mother
attracted
by
the
noise
i
was
making
half
opened
the
door
mlle
de
brabender
explained
to
her
very
gravely
that
she
was
showing
me
method
my
mother
expostulated
with
me
but
i
would
not
listen
to
anything
as
i
was
nearly
beside
myself
with
laughter
she
then
took
mlle
de
brabender
away
and
left
me
alone
for
she
feared
that
i
should
finish
with
hysterics
when
once
i
was
by
myself
i
began
to
calm
down
i
closed
my
eyes
and
thought
of
my
convent
again
the
de
got
mixed
up
in
my
enervated
brain
with
the
father
which
i
used
to
have
to
repeat
some
days
fifteen
or
twenty
times
as
a
punishment
finally
i
came
to
myself
again
got
up
and
after
bathing
my
face
in
cold
water
went
to
my
mother
whom
i
found
playing
whist
with
my
governess
and
godfather
i
kissed
mlle
de
brabender
and
she
returned
my
kiss
with
such
indulgent
kindness
that
i
felt
quite
embarrassed
by
it
ten
days
passed
by
and
i
did
none
of
exercises
except
the
de
at
the
piano
my
mother
came
and
woke
me
every
morning
for
this
and
it
drove
me
wild
my
godfather
made
me
learn
but
i
understood
nothing
of
what
he
told
me
about
the
verses
he
considered
and
explained
to
me
that
poetry
must
be
said
with
an
intonation
and
that
all
the
value
of
it
resided
in
the
rhyme
his
theories
were
boring
to
listen
to
and
impossible
to
execute
then
i
could
not
understand
character
for
it
did
not
seem
to
me
that
she
loved
hippolyte
at
all
and
she
appeared
to
me
to
be
a
scheming
flirt
my
godfather
explained
to
me
that
in
olden
times
this
was
the
way
people
loved
each
other
and
when
i
remarked
that
phèdre
appeared
to
love
in
a
better
way
than
that
he
took
me
by
the
chin
and
said
look
at
this
naughty
child
she
is
pretending
not
to
understand
and
would
like
us
explain
to
her
this
was
simply
idiotic
i
did
not
understand
and
had
not
asked
anything
but
this
man
had
a
mind
and
was
sly
and
lewd
he
did
not
like
me
because
i
was
thin
but
he
was
interested
in
me
because
i
was
going
to
be
an
actress
that
word
evoked
for
him
the
weak
side
of
our
art
he
did
not
see
the
beauty
the
nobleness
of
it
nor
yet
its
beneficial
power
i
could
not
fathom
all
this
at
that
time
but
i
did
not
feel
at
ease
with
this
man
whom
i
had
seen
from
my
childhood
and
who
was
almost
like
a
father
to
me
i
did
not
want
to
continue
learning
in
the
first
place
i
could
not
talk
about
it
with
my
governess
as
she
would
not
discuss
the
piece
at
all
i
then
learnt
des
and
mlle
de
brabender
explained
agnès
to
me
the
dear
good
lady
did
not
see
much
in
it
for
the
whole
story
appeared
to
her
of
childlike
simplicity
and
when
i
said
the
lines
has
taken
from
me
he
has
taken
from
me
the
ribbon
you
gave
me
she
smiled
in
all
confidence
when
meydieu
and
my
godfather
laughed
heartily
viii
the
conservatoire
finally
the
examination
day
arrived
every
one
had
given
me
advice
but
no
one
any
real
helpful
counsel
it
had
not
occurred
to
any
one
that
i
ought
to
have
had
a
professional
to
prepare
me
for
my
examination
i
got
up
in
the
morning
with
a
heavy
heart
and
an
anxious
mind
my
mother
had
had
a
black
silk
dress
made
for
me
it
was
slightly
and
was
finished
with
a
gathered
berthe
the
frock
was
rather
short
and
showed
my
drawers
these
were
trimmed
with
embroidery
and
came
down
to
my
brown
kid
boots
a
white
guimpe
emerged
from
my
black
bodice
and
was
fastened
round
my
throat
which
was
too
slender
my
hair
was
parted
on
my
forehead
and
then
fell
as
it
liked
for
it
was
not
held
by
pins
or
ribbons
i
wore
a
large
straw
hat
although
the
season
was
rather
advanced
every
one
came
to
inspect
my
dress
and
i
was
turned
round
and
round
twenty
times
at
least
i
had
to
make
my
curtsey
for
every
one
to
see
finally
i
seemed
to
give
general
satisfaction
petit
came
downstairs
with
her
grave
husband
and
kissed
me
she
was
deeply
affected
our
old
marguerite
made
me
sit
down
and
put
before
me
a
cup
of
cold
beef
tea
which
she
had
simmered
so
carefully
for
a
long
time
that
it
was
then
a
delicious
jelly
i
swallowed
it
in
a
second
i
was
in
a
great
hurry
to
start
on
rising
from
my
chair
i
moved
so
brusquely
that
my
dress
caught
on
to
an
invisible
splinter
of
wood
and
was
torn
my
mother
turned
to
a
visitor
who
had
arrived
about
five
minutes
before
and
had
remained
in
contemplative
admiration
ever
since
she
said
to
him
in
a
vexed
tone
is
a
proof
of
what
i
told
you
all
your
silks
tear
with
the
slightest
no
replied
our
visitor
quickly
told
you
that
this
one
was
not
well
dressed
and
let
you
have
it
at
a
low
price
on
that
he
who
spoke
was
a
young
jew
not
ugly
he
was
a
dutchman
shy
tenacious
but
never
violent
i
had
known
him
from
my
childhood
his
father
who
was
a
friend
of
my
on
my
side
was
a
rich
tradesman
and
the
father
of
a
tribe
of
children
he
gave
each
of
his
sons
a
small
sum
of
money
and
sent
them
out
to
make
their
fortune
where
they
liked
jacques
the
one
of
whom
i
am
speaking
came
to
paris
he
had
commenced
by
selling
passover
cakes
and
as
a
boy
had
often
brought
me
some
of
them
to
the
convent
together
with
the
dainties
that
my
mother
sent
me
later
on
my
surprise
was
great
on
seeing
him
offer
my
mother
rolls
of
such
as
is
used
for
tablecloths
for
early
breakfast
i
remember
one
of
those
cloths
the
border
of
which
was
formed
of
medallions
representing
the
french
kings
it
was
from
that
that
i
learned
my
history
best
for
the
last
month
he
had
owned
quite
an
elegant
vehicle
and
he
sold
that
were
not
well
at
present
he
is
one
of
the
leading
jewellers
of
paris
the
slit
in
my
dress
was
soon
mended
and
knowing
now
that
the
silk
was
not
well
dressed
i
treated
it
with
respect
well
finally
we
started
mlle
de
brabender
madame
guérard
and
i
in
a
carriage
that
was
only
intended
for
two
persons
and
i
was
glad
that
it
was
so
small
for
i
was
close
to
two
people
who
were
fond
of
me
and
my
silk
frock
was
spread
carefully
over
their
knees
when
i
entered
the
that
leads
into
the
recital
hall
of
the
conservatoire
there
were
about
fifteen
young
men
and
twenty
girls
there
all
these
girls
were
accompanied
by
their
mother
father
aunt
brother
or
sister
there
was
an
odour
of
pomade
and
vanilla
that
made
me
feel
sick
when
we
were
shown
into
this
room
i
felt
that
every
one
was
looking
at
me
and
i
blushed
to
the
back
of
my
head
madame
guérard
drew
me
gently
along
and
i
turned
to
take
mlle
de
hand
she
came
shyly
forward
blushing
more
and
still
more
confused
than
i
was
every
one
looked
at
her
and
i
saw
the
girls
nudge
each
other
and
nod
in
her
direction
one
of
them
got
suddenly
up
and
moved
across
to
her
mother
mercy
look
at
that
old
sight
she
said
my
poor
governess
felt
most
uncomfortable
and
i
was
furious
i
thought
she
was
a
thousand
times
nicer
than
all
those
fat
mothers
certainly
she
was
different
from
other
people
in
her
appearance
for
mlle
de
brabender
was
wearing
a
dress
and
an
indian
shawl
drawn
tightly
across
her
shoulders
and
fastened
with
a
very
large
cameo
brooch
her
bonnet
was
trimmed
with
ruches
so
close
together
that
it
looked
like
a
she
certainly
was
not
at
all
like
these
dreadful
people
in
whose
society
we
found
ourselves
and
among
whom
there
were
not
more
than
ten
exceptions
the
young
men
were
standing
in
compact
groups
near
the
windows
they
were
laughing
and
i
expect
making
remarks
in
doubtful
taste
the
door
opened
and
a
girl
with
a
red
face
and
a
young
man
perfectly
scarlet
came
back
after
acting
their
scene
they
each
went
to
their
respective
friends
and
then
chattered
away
finding
fault
with
each
other
a
name
was
called
out
mlle
dica
petit
and
i
saw
a
tall
fair
girl
move
forward
without
any
embarrassment
she
stopped
on
her
way
to
kiss
a
pretty
woman
stout
with
a
pink
and
white
complexion
and
very
much
dressed
up
be
afraid
mother
dear
she
said
and
then
she
added
a
few
words
in
dutch
before
disappearing
followed
by
a
young
man
and
a
very
thin
girl
who
were
to
perform
with
her
this
was
explained
to
me
by
léautaud
who
called
over
the
names
of
the
pupils
and
took
down
the
names
of
those
who
were
up
to
pass
their
examination
and
those
who
were
to
act
with
them
and
give
them
the
cues
i
knew
nothing
of
all
this
and
wondered
who
was
to
give
me
the
cues
for
agnès
he
mentioned
several
young
men
but
i
interrupted
him
no
i
said
will
not
ask
any
one
i
do
not
know
any
of
them
and
i
will
not
then
what
will
you
recite
mademoiselle
asked
léautaud
with
the
most
accent
possible
will
recite
a
fable
i
replied
he
burst
out
laughing
as
he
wrote
down
my
name
and
the
title
which
i
gave
him
i
heard
him
still
laughing
under
his
heavy
moustache
as
he
continued
his
round
he
then
went
back
into
the
conservatoire
and
i
began
to
get
feverish
with
excitement
so
much
so
that
madame
guérard
was
anxious
about
me
as
my
health
unfortunately
was
very
delicate
she
made
me
sit
down
and
then
she
put
a
few
drops
of
behind
my
ears
that
will
teach
you
to
wink
like
that
were
the
words
i
suddenly
heard
and
a
girl
with
the
prettiest
face
imaginable
had
her
ears
boxed
soundly
nathalie
mother
was
correcting
her
daughter
i
sprang
up
trembling
with
fright
and
indignation
i
was
as
angry
as
a
young
i
wanted
to
go
and
box
the
horrible
ears
in
return
and
then
to
kiss
the
pretty
girl
who
had
been
insulted
in
this
way
but
i
was
held
back
firmly
by
my
two
guardians
dica
petit
now
returned
and
this
caused
a
diversion
in
the
she
was
radiant
and
quite
satisfied
with
herself
oh
very
well
satisfied
indeed
her
father
held
out
a
little
flask
to
her
in
which
was
some
kind
of
cordial
and
i
should
have
liked
some
of
it
too
for
my
mouth
was
dry
and
burning
her
mother
then
put
a
little
woollen
square
over
her
chest
before
fastening
her
coat
for
her
and
then
all
three
of
them
went
away
several
other
girls
and
young
men
were
called
before
my
turn
came
finally
the
call
of
my
name
made
me
jump
as
a
sardine
does
when
pursued
by
a
big
fish
i
tossed
my
head
to
shake
my
hair
back
and
petit
stroked
my
badly
dressed
silk
mlle
de
brabender
reminded
me
about
the
and
the
the
the
and
the
and
i
then
went
alone
into
the
hall
i
had
never
been
alone
an
hour
in
my
life
as
a
little
child
i
was
always
clinging
to
the
skirts
of
my
nurse
at
the
convent
i
was
always
with
one
of
my
friends
or
one
of
the
sisters
at
home
either
with
mlle
de
brabender
or
madame
guérard
or
if
they
were
not
there
in
the
kitchen
with
marguerite
and
now
there
i
was
alone
in
that
room
with
a
platform
at
the
end
a
large
table
in
the
middle
and
seated
round
this
table
men
who
either
grumbled
growled
or
jeered
there
was
only
one
woman
present
and
she
had
a
loud
voice
she
was
holding
an
eyeglass
and
as
i
entered
she
dropped
it
and
looked
at
me
through
her
i
felt
every
gaze
on
my
back
as
i
climbed
up
the
few
steps
on
to
the
platform
léautaud
bent
forward
and
whispered
your
bow
and
commence
and
then
stop
when
the
chairman
i
looked
at
the
chairman
and
saw
that
it
was
auber
i
had
forgotten
that
he
was
director
of
the
conservatoire
just
as
i
had
forgotten
everything
else
i
at
once
made
my
bow
and
began
pigeons
tendre
a
low
grumbling
sound
was
heard
and
then
a
muttered
an
elocution
class
here
what
an
idea
to
come
here
reciting
fables
it
was
beauvallet
the
deafening
tragedian
of
the
comédie
française
i
stopped
short
my
heart
beating
wildly
on
my
child
said
a
man
with
silvery
hair
this
was
provost
it
be
as
long
as
a
scene
from
a
play
exclaimed
augustine
brohan
the
one
woman
present
i
began
again
pigeons
tendre
au
logis
fut
assez
my
child
louder
said
a
little
man
with
curly
white
hair
in
a
kindly
tone
this
was
samson
i
stopped
again
confused
and
frightened
seized
suddenly
with
such
a
foolish
fit
of
nervousness
that
i
could
have
shouted
or
howled
samson
saw
this
and
said
to
me
come
we
are
not
ogres
he
had
just
been
talking
in
a
low
voice
with
auber
now
begin
again
he
said
speak
no
put
in
augustine
brohan
she
is
to
begin
again
it
will
be
longer
than
a
scene
this
speech
made
all
the
table
laugh
and
that
gave
me
time
to
recover
myself
i
thought
all
these
people
unkind
to
laugh
like
this
at
the
expense
of
a
poor
little
trembling
creature
who
had
been
delivered
over
to
them
bound
hand
and
foot
i
felt
without
exactly
defining
it
a
slight
contempt
for
these
pitiless
judges
since
then
i
have
very
often
thought
of
that
trial
of
mine
and
i
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
individuals
who
are
kind
intelligent
and
compassionate
become
less
estimable
when
they
are
together
the
feeling
of
personal
irresponsibility
arouses
their
evil
instincts
and
the
fear
of
ridicule
chases
away
their
good
ones
when
i
had
recovered
my
will
power
i
began
my
fable
again
determined
not
to
mind
what
happened
my
voice
was
more
liquid
on
account
of
the
emotion
and
the
desire
to
make
myself
heard
caused
it
to
be
more
resonant
there
was
silence
and
before
i
had
finished
my
fable
the
little
bell
rang
i
bowed
and
came
down
the
few
steps
from
the
platform
thoroughly
exhausted
auber
stopped
me
as
i
was
passing
by
the
table
little
girl
he
said
was
very
good
indeed
provost
and
beauvallet
both
want
you
in
their
i
recoiled
slightly
when
he
told
me
which
was
beauvallet
for
he
was
the
who
had
given
me
such
a
fright
which
of
these
two
gentlemen
should
you
prefer
he
asked
i
did
not
utter
a
word
but
pointed
to
provost
all
right
get
your
handkerchief
out
my
poor
beauvallet
and
i
shall
entrust
this
child
to
you
my
dear
i
understood
and
wild
with
joy
i
exclaimed
i
have
passed
you
have
passed
and
there
is
only
one
thing
i
regret
and
that
is
that
such
a
pretty
voice
should
not
be
for
i
did
not
hear
anything
else
for
i
was
beside
myself
with
joy
i
did
not
stay
to
thank
any
one
but
bounded
to
the
door
petit
mademoiselle
i
have
passed
i
exclaimed
and
when
they
shook
hands
and
asked
me
no
end
of
questions
i
could
only
reply
quite
true
i
have
passed
i
have
passed
i
was
surrounded
and
questioned
do
you
know
that
you
have
passed
no
one
knows
yes
i
know
though
monsieur
auber
told
me
i
am
to
go
into
monsieur
class
monsieur
beauvallet
wanted
me
but
his
voice
is
too
loud
for
me
a
disagreeable
girl
exclaimed
you
stop
that
and
so
they
all
want
you
a
pretty
girl
who
was
too
dark
though
for
my
taste
came
nearer
and
asked
me
gently
what
i
had
recited
fable
of
the
pigeons
i
replied
she
was
surprised
and
so
was
every
one
while
as
for
me
i
was
wildly
delighted
to
surprise
them
all
i
tossed
my
hat
on
my
head
shook
my
frock
out
and
dragging
my
two
friends
along
ran
away
dancing
they
wanted
to
take
me
to
the
to
have
something
but
i
refused
we
got
into
a
cab
and
i
should
have
liked
to
push
that
cab
along
myself
i
fancied
i
saw
the
words
have
passed
written
up
over
all
the
shops
when
on
account
of
the
crowded
streets
the
cab
had
to
stop
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
people
stared
at
me
and
i
caught
myself
tossing
my
head
as
though
telling
them
all
that
it
was
quite
true
i
had
passed
my
examination
i
never
thought
any
more
about
the
convent
and
only
experienced
a
feeling
of
pride
at
having
succeeded
in
my
first
venturesome
enterprise
venturesome
but
the
success
had
only
depended
on
me
it
seemed
to
me
as
though
the
cabman
would
never
arrive
at
rue
honoré
i
kept
putting
my
head
out
of
the
window
and
saying
cabby
faster
please
at
last
we
reached
the
house
and
i
sprang
out
of
the
cab
and
hurried
along
to
tell
the
good
news
to
my
mother
on
the
way
i
was
stopped
by
the
daughter
of
the
she
was
a
and
worked
in
a
little
room
on
the
top
floor
of
the
house
which
was
opposite
our
where
i
used
to
do
my
lessons
with
my
governess
so
that
i
could
not
help
seeing
her
ruddy
face
constantly
i
had
never
spoken
to
her
but
i
knew
who
she
was
mademoiselle
sarah
are
you
satisfied
she
called
out
yes
i
have
passed
i
answered
and
i
could
not
resist
stopping
a
minute
in
order
to
enjoy
the
astonishment
of
the
family
i
then
hurried
on
but
on
reaching
the
courtyard
came
to
a
dead
stand
anger
and
grief
taking
possession
of
me
for
there
i
beheld
my
her
two
hands
forming
a
trumpet
her
head
thrown
back
shouting
to
my
mother
who
was
leaning
out
of
the
window
yes
she
has
passed
i
gave
her
a
thump
with
my
clenched
hand
and
began
to
cry
with
rage
for
i
had
prepared
a
little
story
for
my
mother
ending
up
with
the
joyful
surprise
i
had
intended
putting
on
a
very
sad
look
on
arriving
at
the
door
and
pretending
to
be
and
ashamed
i
felt
sure
she
would
say
i
am
not
surprised
my
poor
child
you
are
so
foolish
and
then
i
should
have
thrown
my
arms
round
her
neck
and
said
true
it
true
i
have
passed
i
had
pictured
to
myself
her
face
brightening
up
and
then
old
marguerite
and
my
godfather
laughing
heartily
and
my
sisters
dancing
with
joy
and
here
was
madame
guérard
sounding
her
trumpet
and
spoiling
all
the
effects
that
i
had
prepared
so
well
i
must
say
that
the
kind
woman
continued
as
long
as
she
lived
that
is
the
greater
part
of
my
life
to
spoil
all
my
effects
it
was
all
in
vain
that
i
made
scenes
she
could
not
help
herself
whenever
i
related
an
adventure
and
wanted
it
to
be
very
effective
she
would
invariably
burst
into
fits
of
laughter
before
the
end
of
it
if
i
told
a
story
with
a
very
lamentable
ending
which
was
to
be
a
surprise
she
would
sigh
roll
her
eyes
and
murmur
dear
oh
dear
so
that
i
always
missed
the
effect
i
was
counting
on
all
this
used
to
exasperate
me
to
such
a
degree
that
before
beginning
a
story
or
a
game
i
used
to
ask
her
to
go
out
of
the
room
and
she
would
get
up
and
go
laughing
at
the
idea
of
the
blunder
she
would
make
if
there
abusing
guérard
i
went
upstairs
to
my
mother
whom
i
found
at
the
open
door
she
kissed
me
affectionately
and
on
seeing
my
sulky
face
asked
if
i
was
not
satisfied
i
replied
i
am
furious
with
guérard
be
nice
mamma
and
pretend
you
know
shut
the
door
and
i
will
she
did
this
and
i
rang
the
bell
marguerite
opened
the
door
and
my
mother
came
and
pretended
to
be
astonished
my
sisters
too
arrived
and
my
godfather
and
my
aunt
when
i
kissed
my
mother
exclaiming
have
passed
every
one
shouted
with
joy
and
i
was
gay
again
i
had
made
my
effect
anyhow
it
was
taking
possession
of
me
unawares
my
sister
régina
whom
the
sisters
would
not
have
in
the
convent
and
so
had
sent
home
began
to
dance
a
jig
she
had
learnt
this
in
the
country
when
she
had
been
put
out
to
nurse
and
upon
every
occasion
she
danced
it
finishing
always
with
this
couplet
éjouis
toi
tout
ce
ze
est
toi
nothing
could
be
more
comic
than
this
chubby
child
with
her
serious
air
régina
never
laughed
and
only
a
suspicion
of
a
smile
ever
played
over
her
thin
lips
and
her
mouth
which
was
too
small
nothing
could
be
more
comic
than
to
see
her
looking
grave
and
rough
dancing
the
jig
she
was
funnier
than
ever
that
day
as
she
was
excited
by
the
general
joy
she
was
four
years
old
and
nothing
ever
embarrassed
her
she
was
both
timid
and
bold
she
detested
society
and
people
generally
and
when
she
was
made
to
go
into
the
she
embarrassed
people
by
her
crude
remarks
which
were
most
odd
by
her
rough
answers
and
her
kicks
and
blows
she
was
a
terrible
child
with
silvery
hair
dark
complexion
blue
eyes
too
large
for
her
face
and
thick
lashes
which
made
a
shadow
on
her
cheeks
when
she
lowered
the
lids
and
joined
her
eyebrows
when
her
eyes
were
open
she
would
be
four
or
five
hours
sometimes
without
uttering
a
word
without
answering
any
question
she
was
asked
and
then
she
would
jump
up
from
her
little
chair
begin
to
sing
as
loud
as
she
could
and
dance
the
jig
on
this
day
she
was
in
a
good
temper
for
she
kissed
me
affectionately
and
opened
her
thin
lips
to
smile
my
sister
jeanne
kissed
me
and
made
me
tell
her
about
my
examination
my
godfather
gave
me
a
hundred
francs
and
meydieu
who
had
just
arrived
to
find
out
the
result
promised
to
take
me
the
next
day
to
to
choose
a
clock
for
my
room
as
that
was
one
of
my
dreams
ix
a
marriage
proposal
and
examinations
the
conservatoire
an
evolution
took
place
in
me
from
that
day
for
rather
a
long
time
my
soul
remained
but
my
mind
discerned
life
more
distinctly
i
felt
the
need
of
creating
a
personality
for
myself
that
was
the
first
awakening
of
my
will
i
wanted
to
be
some
one
mlle
de
brabender
declared
to
me
that
this
was
pride
it
seemed
to
me
that
it
was
not
quite
that
but
i
could
not
then
define
what
the
sentiment
was
which
imposed
this
wish
on
me
i
did
not
understand
until
a
few
months
later
why
i
wished
to
be
some
one
a
friend
of
my
made
me
an
offer
of
marriage
this
man
was
a
rich
tanner
and
very
kind
but
so
dark
and
with
such
long
hair
and
such
a
beard
that
he
disgusted
me
i
refused
him
and
my
godfather
then
asked
to
speak
to
me
alone
he
made
me
sit
down
in
my
boudoir
and
said
to
me
poor
child
it
is
pure
folly
to
refuse
monsieur
bed
he
has
sixty
thousand
francs
a
year
and
it
was
the
first
time
i
had
heard
this
use
of
the
word
and
when
the
meaning
was
explained
to
me
i
wondered
if
that
was
the
right
thing
to
say
on
such
an
occasion
yes
replied
my
godfather
are
idiotic
with
your
romantic
ideas
marriage
is
a
business
affair
and
must
be
considered
as
such
your
future
and
will
have
to
die
just
as
we
shall
and
it
is
by
no
means
disagreeable
to
know
that
they
will
leave
two
million
francs
to
their
son
and
consequently
to
you
if
you
marry
shall
not
marry
him
i
do
not
love
you
never
love
your
husband
before
replied
my
practical
adviser
can
love
him
what
your
mother
but
listen
to
me
now
for
it
is
not
a
question
of
that
you
must
marry
your
mother
has
a
small
income
which
your
father
left
her
but
this
income
comes
from
the
profits
of
the
manufactory
which
belongs
to
your
grandmother
and
she
can
not
bear
your
mother
who
will
therefore
lose
that
income
and
then
she
will
have
nothing
and
three
children
on
her
hands
it
is
that
accursed
lawyer
who
is
arranging
all
this
the
whys
and
wherefores
would
take
too
long
to
explain
your
father
managed
his
business
affairs
very
badly
you
must
marry
therefore
if
not
for
your
own
sake
for
the
sake
of
your
mother
and
sisters
you
can
then
give
your
mother
the
hundred
thousand
francs
your
father
left
you
which
no
one
else
can
touch
monsieur
bed
will
settle
three
hundred
thousand
francs
on
you
i
have
arranged
everything
so
that
you
can
give
this
to
your
mother
if
you
like
and
with
four
hundred
thousand
francs
she
will
be
able
to
live
very
i
cried
and
sobbed
and
asked
to
have
time
to
think
it
over
i
found
my
mother
in
the
your
godfather
told
you
she
asked
gently
in
rather
a
timid
way
mother
yes
he
has
told
me
let
me
think
it
over
will
you
i
said
sobbing
as
i
kissed
her
neck
lingeringly
i
then
locked
myself
in
my
bedroom
and
for
the
first
time
for
many
days
i
regretted
my
convent
all
my
childhood
rose
up
before
me
and
i
cried
more
and
more
and
felt
so
unhappy
that
i
wished
i
could
die
gradually
however
i
began
to
get
calm
again
and
realised
what
had
happened
and
what
my
words
meant
most
decidedly
i
did
not
want
to
marry
this
man
since
i
had
been
at
the
conservatoire
i
had
learnt
a
few
things
vaguely
very
vaguely
for
i
was
never
alone
but
i
understood
enough
to
make
me
not
want
to
marry
without
being
in
love
i
was
however
destined
to
be
attacked
in
a
quarter
from
which
i
should
not
have
expected
it
madame
guérard
asked
me
to
go
up
to
her
room
to
see
the
embroidery
she
was
doing
on
a
frame
for
my
birthday
my
astonishment
was
great
to
find
bed
there
he
begged
me
to
change
my
mind
he
made
me
very
wretched
for
he
pleaded
with
tears
in
his
eyes
you
want
a
larger
marriage
settlement
he
asked
would
make
it
five
hundred
thousand
but
it
was
not
that
at
all
and
i
said
in
a
very
low
voice
do
not
love
you
you
do
not
marry
me
mademoiselle
he
said
shall
die
of
i
looked
at
him
and
repeated
to
myself
the
words
of
i
was
embarrassed
and
desperate
but
at
the
same
time
delighted
for
he
loved
me
just
as
a
man
does
in
a
play
phrases
that
i
had
read
or
heard
came
to
my
mind
vaguely
and
i
repeated
them
without
any
real
conviction
and
then
left
him
without
the
slightest
coquetry
bed
did
not
die
he
is
still
living
and
has
a
very
important
financial
position
he
is
much
nicer
now
than
when
he
was
so
black
for
at
present
he
is
quite
white
well
i
had
just
passed
my
first
examination
with
remarkable
success
particularly
in
tragedy
provost
my
professor
had
not
wanted
me
to
compete
in
but
i
had
insisted
i
thought
that
scene
with
zaïre
and
her
brother
néréstan
very
fine
and
it
suited
me
but
when
zaïre
overwhelmed
with
her
reproaches
falls
on
her
knees
at
his
feet
provost
wanted
me
to
say
the
words
i
tell
you
i
love
him
with
violence
and
i
wanted
to
say
them
gently
perfectly
resigned
to
a
death
that
was
almost
certain
i
argued
about
it
for
a
long
time
with
my
professor
and
finally
i
appeared
to
give
in
to
him
during
the
lesson
but
on
the
day
of
the
competition
i
fell
on
my
knees
before
néréstan
with
a
sob
so
real
my
arms
outstretched
offering
my
heart
so
full
of
love
to
the
deadly
blow
that
i
expected
and
i
murmured
with
such
tenderness
i
tell
you
i
love
him
that
the
whole
house
burst
into
applause
and
repeated
the
outburst
twice
over
the
second
prize
for
tragedy
was
awarded
me
to
the
great
dissatisfaction
of
the
public
as
it
was
thought
that
i
ought
to
have
had
the
first
prize
and
yet
it
was
only
just
that
i
should
have
the
second
on
account
of
my
age
and
the
short
time
i
had
been
studying
i
had
a
first
accessit
or
comedy
in
fausse
i
felt
therefore
that
i
had
the
right
to
refuse
my
future
lay
open
before
me
and
consequently
my
mother
would
not
be
in
want
if
she
should
lose
her
present
income
a
few
days
later
régnier
professor
at
the
conservatoire
and
secretary
of
the
comédie
française
came
to
ask
my
mother
whether
she
would
allow
me
to
play
in
a
piece
of
his
at
the
vaudeville
the
piece
was
and
the
managers
would
give
me
francs
for
each
performance
i
was
amazed
at
the
sum
seven
hundred
and
fifty
francs
a
month
for
my
first
appearance
i
was
wild
with
joy
i
besought
my
mother
to
accept
the
offer
made
by
the
vaudeville
and
she
told
me
to
do
as
i
liked
in
the
matter
i
asked
camille
doucet
director
of
the
fine
arts
department
to
be
so
good
as
to
receive
me
and
as
my
mother
always
refused
to
accompany
me
madame
guérard
went
with
me
my
little
sister
régina
begged
me
to
take
her
and
very
unwisely
i
consented
we
had
not
been
in
the
office
more
than
five
minutes
before
my
sister
who
was
only
six
years
old
began
to
climb
on
to
the
furniture
she
jumped
on
to
a
stool
and
finally
sat
down
on
the
floor
pulling
towards
her
the
paper
basket
which
was
under
the
desk
and
proceeded
to
spread
about
all
the
torn
papers
which
it
contained
on
seeing
this
camille
doucet
mildly
observed
that
she
was
not
a
very
good
little
girl
my
sister
with
her
head
in
the
basket
answered
in
her
husky
voice
you
bother
me
monsieur
i
shall
tell
every
one
that
you
are
there
to
give
out
holy
water
that
is
poison
my
aunt
says
my
face
turned
purple
with
shame
and
i
stammered
out
do
not
believe
that
monsieur
doucet
my
little
sister
is
telling
an
régina
sprang
to
her
feet
and
clenching
her
little
fists
rushed
at
me
like
a
little
fury
rosine
never
said
that
she
exclaimed
are
telling
an
untruth
why
she
said
it
to
monsieur
de
morny
and
he
answered
i
had
forgotten
this
and
i
have
forgotten
what
the
duc
de
morny
answered
but
beside
myself
with
anger
i
put
my
hand
over
my
mouth
and
took
her
quickly
away
she
howled
like
a
polecat
and
we
rushed
like
a
hurricane
through
the
which
was
full
of
people
i
then
gave
way
to
one
of
those
violent
fits
of
temper
to
which
i
had
been
subject
in
my
childhood
i
sprang
into
the
first
cab
that
passed
the
door
and
when
once
in
the
cab
struck
my
sister
with
such
fury
that
madame
guérard
was
alarmed
and
protected
her
with
her
own
body
receiving
all
the
blows
i
gave
with
my
head
arms
and
feet
for
in
my
anger
grief
and
shame
i
flung
myself
about
to
right
and
left
my
grief
was
all
the
more
profound
from
the
fact
that
i
was
very
fond
of
camille
doucet
he
was
gentle
and
charming
affable
and
he
had
refused
my
aunt
something
she
had
asked
for
and
unaccustomed
to
being
refused
anything
she
had
a
spite
against
him
this
had
nothing
to
do
with
me
though
and
i
wondered
what
camille
doucet
would
think
and
then
too
i
had
not
asked
him
about
the
vaudeville
all
my
fine
dreams
had
come
to
nothing
and
it
was
this
little
monster
who
looked
as
fair
and
as
white
as
a
seraph
who
had
just
shattered
my
first
hopes
huddled
up
in
the
cab
an
expression
of
fear
on
her
looking
face
and
her
thin
lips
compressed
she
was
gazing
at
me
under
her
long
lashes
with
eyes
on
reaching
home
i
told
my
mother
all
that
had
happened
and
she
declared
that
my
little
sister
should
have
no
dessert
for
two
days
régina
was
greedy
but
her
pride
was
greater
than
her
greediness
she
turned
round
on
her
little
heels
and
dancing
her
jig
began
to
sing
little
stomach
at
all
pleased
until
i
wanted
to
rush
at
her
and
shake
her
a
few
days
later
during
my
lessons
i
was
told
that
the
ministry
refused
to
allow
me
to
perform
at
the
vaudeville
régnier
told
me
how
sorry
he
was
but
he
added
in
a
kindly
tone
but
my
dear
child
the
conservatoire
thinks
a
lot
of
you
therefore
you
need
not
worry
too
am
sure
that
camille
doucet
is
at
the
bottom
of
it
i
said
he
certainly
is
not
answered
régnier
doucet
was
your
warmest
advocate
but
the
minister
will
not
upon
any
account
hear
of
anything
that
might
be
detrimental
to
your
next
i
at
once
felt
most
grateful
to
camille
doucet
for
his
kindness
in
bearing
no
after
my
little
stupid
behaviour
i
began
to
work
again
with
the
greatest
zeal
and
did
not
miss
a
single
lesson
every
morning
i
went
to
the
conservatoire
with
my
governess
we
started
early
as
i
preferred
walking
to
taking
the
omnibus
and
i
kept
the
franc
which
my
mother
gave
me
every
morning
sixty
centimes
of
which
was
for
the
omnibus
and
forty
for
cakes
we
were
to
walk
home
always
but
every
other
day
we
took
a
cab
with
the
two
francs
i
had
saved
for
this
purpose
my
mother
never
knew
about
this
little
scheme
but
it
was
not
without
remorse
that
my
kind
brabender
consented
to
be
my
accomplice
as
i
said
before
i
did
not
miss
a
lesson
and
i
even
went
to
the
deportment
class
at
which
poor
old
elie
duly
curled
powdered
and
adorned
with
lace
frills
presided
this
was
the
most
amusing
lesson
imaginable
very
few
of
us
attended
this
class
and
elie
avenged
himself
on
us
for
the
abstention
of
the
others
at
every
lesson
each
one
of
us
was
called
forward
he
addressed
us
by
the
familiar
term
of
and
considered
us
as
his
property
there
were
only
five
or
six
of
us
but
we
all
had
to
go
on
the
stage
he
always
stood
up
with
his
little
black
stick
in
his
hand
no
one
knew
why
he
had
this
stick
young
ladies
he
would
say
body
thrown
back
the
head
up
on
it
perfect
one
two
three
march
and
we
marched
along
on
with
heads
up
and
eyelids
drawn
over
our
eyes
as
we
tried
to
look
down
in
order
to
see
where
we
were
walking
we
marched
along
like
this
with
all
the
stateliness
and
solemnity
of
camels
he
then
taught
us
to
make
our
exit
with
indifference
dignity
or
fury
and
it
was
amusing
to
see
us
going
towards
the
doors
either
with
a
lagging
step
or
in
an
animated
or
hurried
way
according
to
the
mood
in
which
we
were
supposed
to
be
then
we
heard
go
not
a
word
for
elie
would
not
allow
us
to
murmur
a
single
word
he
used
to
say
in
the
look
the
gesture
the
attitude
then
there
was
what
he
called
which
meant
the
way
to
sit
down
in
a
dignified
manner
to
let
self
fall
into
a
seat
wearily
or
the
which
meant
am
listening
monsieur
say
what
you
ah
that
was
distractingly
complicated
that
way
of
sitting
down
we
had
to
put
everything
into
it
the
desire
to
know
what
was
going
to
be
said
to
us
the
fear
of
hearing
it
the
determination
to
go
away
the
will
to
stay
oh
the
tears
that
this
cost
me
poor
old
elie
i
do
not
bear
him
any
but
i
did
my
utmost
later
on
to
forget
everything
he
had
taught
me
for
nothing
could
have
been
more
useless
than
those
deportment
lessons
every
human
being
moves
about
according
to
his
or
her
proportions
women
who
are
too
tall
take
long
strides
those
who
stoop
walk
like
the
eastern
women
stout
women
walk
like
ducks
ones
trot
very
small
women
skip
along
and
the
gawky
ones
walk
like
cranes
nothing
can
be
changed
and
the
deportment
class
has
very
wisely
been
abolished
the
gesture
must
depict
the
thought
and
it
is
harmonious
or
stupid
according
to
whether
the
artist
is
intelligent
or
dull
on
the
stage
one
needs
long
arms
it
is
better
to
have
them
too
long
than
too
short
an
artiste
with
short
arms
can
never
never
make
a
fine
gesture
it
was
all
in
vain
that
poor
elie
told
us
this
or
that
we
were
always
stupid
and
awkward
whilst
he
was
always
comic
oh
so
comic
poor
old
man
i
also
took
aunt
rosine
put
this
idea
into
my
head
i
had
a
lesson
once
a
week
from
the
famous
pons
oh
what
a
terrible
man
he
was
brutal
rude
and
always
teasing
he
was
an
incomparable
but
he
disliked
giving
lessons
to
like
us
as
he
called
us
he
was
not
rich
though
and
i
believe
but
am
not
sure
of
it
that
this
class
had
been
organised
for
him
by
a
distinguished
patron
of
his
he
always
kept
his
hat
on
and
this
horrified
mlle
de
brabender
he
smoked
his
cigar
too
all
the
time
and
this
made
his
pupils
cough
as
they
were
already
out
of
breath
from
the
fencing
exercise
what
torture
those
lessons
were
he
sometimes
brought
with
him
friends
of
his
who
delighted
in
our
awkwardness
this
gave
rise
to
a
scandal
as
one
day
one
of
these
gay
spectators
made
a
most
violent
remark
about
one
of
the
male
pupils
named
châtelain
and
the
latter
turned
round
quickly
and
gave
him
a
blow
in
the
face
a
skirmish
immediately
occurred
and
pons
on
endeavouring
to
intervene
received
a
blow
or
two
himself
this
made
a
great
stir
and
from
that
day
forth
visitors
were
not
allowed
to
be
present
at
the
lesson
i
obtained
my
authorisation
to
discontinue
attending
the
class
and
this
was
a
great
relief
to
me
i
very
much
preferred
lessons
to
any
others
he
was
gentle
had
nice
manners
and
taught
us
to
be
natural
in
what
we
recited
but
i
certainly
owe
all
that
i
know
to
the
variety
of
instruction
which
i
had
and
which
i
followed
up
in
the
most
devoted
way
provost
taught
a
broad
style
with
diction
somewhat
pompous
but
sustained
he
specially
emphasised
freedom
of
gesture
and
inflexion
beauvallet
in
my
opinion
did
not
teach
anything
that
was
any
good
he
had
a
deep
effective
voice
but
that
he
could
not
give
to
any
one
it
was
an
admirable
instrument
but
it
did
not
give
him
any
talent
he
was
awkward
in
his
gestures
his
arms
were
too
short
and
his
face
common
i
detested
him
as
a
professor
samson
was
just
the
opposite
his
voice
was
not
strong
but
piercing
he
had
a
certain
acquired
distinction
but
was
very
correct
his
method
was
simplicity
provost
emphasised
breadth
samson
exactitude
and
he
was
very
particular
about
the
finals
he
would
not
allow
us
to
drop
the
voice
at
the
end
of
the
phrase
coquelin
who
is
one
of
pupils
i
believe
has
a
great
deal
of
style
although
he
has
retained
the
essentials
of
his
first
teaching
as
for
me
i
remember
my
three
professors
régnier
provost
and
samson
as
though
i
had
heard
them
only
yesterday
the
year
passed
by
without
any
great
change
in
my
life
but
two
months
before
my
second
examination
i
had
the
misfortune
to
have
to
change
my
professor
provost
was
taken
ill
and
i
went
into
class
he
counted
very
much
on
me
but
he
was
authoritative
and
persistent
he
gave
me
two
very
bad
parts
in
two
very
bad
pieces
hortense
in
des
by
casimir
delavigne
for
comedy
and
fille
du
for
tragedy
this
piece
was
also
by
casimir
delavigne
i
did
not
feel
at
all
in
my
element
in
these
two
both
of
which
were
written
in
hard
emphatic
language
the
examination
day
arrived
and
i
did
not
look
at
all
nice
my
mother
had
insisted
on
my
having
my
hair
done
by
her
hairdresser
and
i
had
cried
and
sobbed
on
seeing
this
make
partings
all
over
my
head
in
order
to
separate
my
rebellious
mane
idiot
that
he
was
he
had
suggested
this
style
to
my
mother
and
my
head
was
in
his
stupid
hands
for
more
than
hour
and
a
half
for
he
never
before
had
to
deal
with
a
mane
like
mine
he
kept
mopping
his
forehead
every
five
minutes
and
muttering
hair
good
heavens
it
is
horrible
just
like
tow
it
might
be
the
hair
of
a
white
negress
turning
to
my
mother
he
suggested
that
my
head
should
be
entirely
shaved
and
the
hair
then
trained
as
it
grew
again
will
think
about
it
replied
my
mother
in
an
way
i
turned
my
head
so
abruptly
to
look
at
her
when
she
said
this
that
the
curling
irons
burnt
my
forehead
the
man
was
using
the
irons
to
my
hair
he
considered
that
it
curled
naturally
in
such
a
disordered
style
that
he
must
get
the
natural
curl
out
of
it
and
then
wave
it
as
this
would
be
more
becoming
to
the
face
hair
is
stopped
in
its
growth
by
this
extreme
curliness
all
the
tangier
girls
and
negresses
have
hair
like
this
as
mademoiselle
is
going
on
to
the
stage
she
would
look
better
if
she
had
hair
like
madame
he
said
bowing
with
respectful
admiration
to
my
mother
who
certainly
had
the
most
beautiful
hair
imaginable
it
was
fair
and
so
long
that
when
standing
up
she
could
tread
on
it
and
bend
her
head
forward
it
is
only
fair
to
say
though
that
my
mother
was
very
short
finally
i
was
out
of
the
hands
of
this
wretched
man
and
was
nearly
dead
with
fatigue
after
an
hour
and
a
brushing
combing
curling
with
my
head
turned
from
left
to
right
and
from
right
to
left
i
was
completely
disfigured
at
the
end
of
it
all
and
did
not
recognise
myself
my
hair
was
drawn
tightly
back
from
my
temples
my
ears
were
very
visible
and
stood
out
looking
positively
bold
in
their
bareness
whilst
on
the
top
of
my
head
was
a
parcel
of
little
sausages
arranged
near
each
other
to
imitate
the
ancient
diadem
i
looked
perfectly
hideous
my
forehead
which
i
always
saw
more
or
less
covered
with
a
golden
fluff
of
hair
seemed
to
me
immense
implacable
i
did
not
recognise
my
eyes
accustomed
as
i
was
to
see
them
shadowed
by
my
hair
my
head
weighed
two
or
three
pounds
i
was
accustomed
to
fasten
my
hair
as
i
still
do
with
two
hairpins
and
this
man
had
put
five
or
six
packets
in
it
and
all
this
was
heavy
for
my
poor
head
i
was
late
and
so
i
had
to
dress
very
quickly
i
cried
with
anger
and
my
eyes
looked
smaller
my
nose
larger
and
my
veins
swelled
the
climax
was
when
i
had
to
put
my
hat
on
it
would
not
go
on
the
packet
of
sausages
and
my
mother
wrapped
my
head
up
in
a
lace
scarf
and
hurried
me
to
the
door
on
arriving
at
the
conservatoire
i
hurried
with
petit
to
the
whilst
my
mother
went
direct
to
the
theatre
i
tore
off
the
lace
which
covered
my
hair
and
seated
on
a
bench
after
relating
the
odyssey
of
my
i
gave
my
head
up
to
my
companions
all
of
them
adored
and
envied
my
hair
because
it
was
so
soft
and
light
and
golden
they
were
all
sorry
for
me
in
my
misery
and
were
touched
by
my
ugliness
their
mothers
however
were
brimming
over
with
joy
in
their
own
fat
the
girls
began
to
take
out
my
and
one
of
them
marie
lloyd
whom
i
liked
best
took
my
head
in
her
hands
and
kissed
it
affectionately
your
beautiful
hair
what
have
they
done
to
it
she
exclaimed
pulling
out
the
last
of
the
this
sympathy
made
me
once
more
burst
into
tears
finally
i
stood
up
triumphant
without
any
and
without
any
sausages
but
my
poor
hair
was
very
heavy
with
the
pomade
the
wretched
man
had
put
on
it
and
it
was
full
of
the
partings
he
had
made
for
the
creation
of
the
sausages
it
fell
now
in
greasy
flakes
round
my
face
i
shook
my
head
for
five
minutes
in
mad
rage
i
then
succeeded
in
making
the
hair
more
loose
and
i
put
it
up
as
well
as
i
could
with
a
couple
of
the
competition
had
commenced
and
i
was
the
tenth
on
the
list
i
could
not
remember
what
i
had
to
say
madame
guérard
moistened
my
temples
with
cold
water
and
mlle
de
brabender
who
had
only
just
arrived
did
not
recognise
me
and
looked
about
for
me
everywhere
she
had
broken
her
leg
nearly
three
months
before
and
had
to
hobble
about
on
a
but
she
had
resolved
to
come
madame
guérard
was
just
beginning
to
tell
her
about
the
drama
of
the
hair
when
my
name
echoed
through
the
room
chara
bernhardt
it
was
léautaud
who
later
on
was
prompter
at
the
comédie
française
and
who
had
a
strong
accent
peculiar
to
the
natives
of
auvergne
chara
bernhardt
i
heard
again
and
then
i
sprang
up
without
an
idea
in
my
mind
and
without
uttering
a
word
i
looked
round
for
my
partner
who
was
to
give
me
my
cues
and
together
we
made
our
entry
i
was
surprised
at
the
sound
of
my
voice
which
i
did
not
recognise
i
had
cried
so
much
that
it
had
affected
my
voice
and
i
spoke
through
my
nose
i
heard
a
voice
say
child
she
ought
not
to
have
been
allowed
to
compete
she
has
an
atrocious
cold
her
nose
is
running
and
her
face
is
i
finished
my
scene
made
my
bow
and
went
away
in
the
midst
of
very
feeble
and
spiritless
applause
i
walked
like
a
somnambulist
and
on
reaching
madame
guérard
and
mlle
de
brabender
fainted
away
in
their
arms
some
one
went
to
the
hall
in
search
of
a
doctor
and
the
rumour
that
little
bernhardt
had
reached
my
mother
she
was
sitting
far
back
in
a
box
feeling
bored
to
death
when
i
came
to
myself
again
i
opened
my
eyes
and
saw
my
pretty
face
with
tears
hanging
on
her
long
lashes
i
laid
my
head
against
hers
and
cried
quietly
but
this
time
the
tears
were
refreshing
not
salt
ones
that
burnt
my
eyelids
i
stood
up
shook
out
my
dress
and
looked
at
myself
in
the
greenish
mirror
i
was
certainly
less
ugly
now
for
my
face
was
rested
my
hair
was
once
more
soft
and
fluffy
and
altogether
there
was
a
general
improvement
in
my
appearance
the
tragedy
competition
was
over
and
the
prizes
had
been
awarded
i
had
nothing
at
all
but
mention
was
made
of
my
last
second
prize
i
felt
confused
but
it
did
not
cause
me
any
disappointment
as
i
quite
expected
things
to
be
like
this
several
persons
had
protested
in
my
favour
camille
doucet
who
was
a
member
of
the
jury
had
pleaded
a
long
time
he
wanted
me
to
have
a
first
prize
in
spite
of
my
bad
recitation
he
said
that
my
examination
results
ought
to
be
taken
into
account
and
they
were
excellent
and
then
too
i
had
the
best
class
reports
nothing
however
could
overcome
the
bad
effect
produced
that
day
by
my
nasal
voice
my
swollen
face
and
my
heavy
flakes
of
hair
after
half
an
interval
during
which
i
drank
a
glass
of
port
wine
and
ate
cakes
the
signal
was
given
for
the
comedy
competition
i
was
fourteenth
on
the
list
for
this
so
that
i
had
ample
time
to
recover
my
fighting
instinct
now
began
to
take
possession
of
me
and
a
sense
of
injustice
made
me
feel
rebellious
i
had
not
deserved
my
prize
that
day
but
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
ought
to
have
received
it
nevertheless
i
made
up
my
mind
that
i
would
have
the
first
prize
for
comedy
and
with
the
exaggeration
that
i
have
always
put
into
everything
i
began
to
get
excited
and
i
said
to
myself
that
if
i
did
not
get
the
first
prize
i
must
give
up
the
idea
of
the
stage
as
a
career
my
mystic
love
and
weakness
for
the
convent
came
back
to
me
more
strongly
than
ever
i
decided
that
i
would
enter
the
convent
if
i
did
not
get
the
first
prize
and
the
most
foolish
illogical
strife
imaginable
was
waged
in
my
weak
brain
i
felt
a
genuine
vocation
for
the
convent
when
distressed
about
losing
the
prize
and
a
genuine
vocation
for
the
theatre
when
i
was
hopeful
about
winning
the
prize
with
a
very
natural
partiality
i
discovered
in
myself
the
gift
of
absolute
renunciation
and
devotion
of
every
kind
qualities
which
would
win
for
me
easily
the
post
of
mother
superior
in
the
convent
then
with
the
most
indulgent
generosity
i
attributed
to
myself
all
the
necessary
gifts
for
the
fulfilment
of
my
other
dream
namely
to
become
the
first
the
most
celebrated
and
the
most
envied
of
actresses
i
told
off
on
my
fingers
all
my
qualities
grace
charm
distinction
beauty
mystery
piquancy
oh
yes
i
found
i
had
all
these
and
when
my
reason
and
my
honesty
raised
any
doubt
or
suggested
a
to
this
fabulous
inventory
of
my
qualities
my
combative
and
paradoxical
ego
at
once
found
a
plain
decisive
answer
which
admitted
of
no
further
argument
it
was
under
these
special
conditions
and
in
this
frame
of
mind
that
i
went
on
to
the
stage
when
my
turn
came
the
choice
of
my
for
this
competition
was
a
very
stupid
one
i
had
to
represent
a
married
woman
who
was
and
very
much
inclined
to
argue
and
i
was
a
mere
child
and
looked
much
younger
than
my
years
in
spite
of
this
i
was
very
brilliant
i
argued
well
was
very
gay
and
made
an
immense
success
i
was
transfigured
with
joy
and
wildly
excited
so
sure
i
felt
of
a
first
prize
i
never
doubted
for
a
moment
but
that
it
would
be
awarded
to
me
unanimously
when
the
competition
was
over
the
committee
met
to
discuss
the
awards
and
in
the
meantime
i
asked
for
something
to
eat
a
cutlet
was
brought
from
the
patronised
by
the
conservatoire
and
i
devoured
it
to
the
great
joy
of
madame
guérard
and
mlle
de
brabender
for
i
detested
meat
and
always
refused
to
eat
it
the
members
of
the
committee
at
last
went
to
their
places
in
the
large
box
and
there
was
silence
in
the
theatre
the
young
men
were
called
first
on
the
stage
there
was
no
first
prize
awarded
to
them
name
was
called
for
the
second
prize
for
comedy
parfouru
is
known
as
paul
porel
director
of
the
vaudeville
theatre
and
husband
after
this
came
the
turn
of
the
girls
i
was
in
the
doorway
ready
to
rush
up
to
the
stage
the
words
prize
for
were
uttered
and
i
made
a
step
forward
pushing
aside
a
girl
who
was
a
head
taller
than
i
was
prize
for
comedy
awarded
unanimously
to
mademoiselle
marie
the
tall
girl
i
had
pushed
aside
now
went
forward
slender
and
radiant
towards
the
stage
there
were
a
few
protestations
but
her
beauty
her
distinction
and
her
modest
charm
won
the
day
with
every
one
and
marie
lloyd
was
cheered
she
passed
me
on
her
return
and
kissed
me
affectionately
we
were
great
friends
and
i
liked
her
very
much
but
i
considered
her
a
nullity
as
a
pupil
i
do
not
remember
whether
she
had
received
any
prize
the
previous
year
but
certainly
no
one
expected
her
to
have
one
now
i
was
simply
petrified
with
amazement
prize
for
comedy
mademoiselle
i
had
not
heard
and
was
pushed
forward
by
my
companions
on
reaching
the
stage
i
bowed
and
all
the
time
i
could
see
hundreds
of
marie
lloyds
dancing
before
me
some
of
them
were
making
grimaces
at
me
others
were
throwing
me
kisses
some
were
fanning
themselves
and
others
bowing
they
were
very
tall
all
these
marie
lloyds
too
tall
for
the
ceiling
and
they
walked
over
the
heads
of
all
the
people
and
came
towards
me
stifling
me
crushing
me
so
that
i
could
not
breathe
my
face
it
seems
was
whiter
than
my
dress
on
leaving
the
stage
i
went
and
sat
down
on
the
bench
without
uttering
a
word
and
looked
at
marie
lloyd
who
was
being
made
much
of
and
who
was
greatly
complimented
by
every
one
she
was
wearing
a
pale
blue
tarlatan
dress
with
a
bunch
of
in
the
bodice
and
another
in
her
black
hair
she
was
very
tall
and
her
delicate
white
shoulders
emerged
modestly
from
her
dress
which
was
cut
very
low
but
in
her
case
this
was
without
danger
her
refined
face
with
its
somewhat
proud
expression
was
charming
and
very
beautiful
although
very
young
she
had
more
of
a
fascination
than
any
of
us
her
large
brown
eyes
shone
with
dilating
pupils
her
small
round
mouth
gave
a
sly
little
smile
at
the
corners
and
her
wonderfully
shaped
nose
had
quivering
nostrils
the
oval
of
her
beautiful
face
was
intercepted
by
two
little
pearly
transparent
ears
of
the
most
exquisite
shape
she
had
a
long
flexible
white
neck
and
the
pose
of
her
head
was
charming
it
was
a
beauty
prize
that
the
jury
had
conscientiously
awarded
to
marie
lloyd
she
had
come
on
to
the
stage
gay
and
fascinating
in
her
of
célimène
and
in
spite
of
the
monotony
of
her
delivery
the
carelessness
of
her
elocution
the
impersonality
of
her
acting
she
had
carried
off
all
the
votes
because
she
was
the
very
personification
of
célimène
that
coquette
of
twenty
years
of
age
who
was
so
unconsciously
cruel
she
had
realised
for
every
one
the
ideal
dreamed
of
by
molière
all
these
thoughts
shaped
themselves
later
on
in
my
brain
and
this
first
lesson
which
was
so
painful
at
the
time
was
of
great
service
to
me
in
my
career
i
never
forgot
marie
prize
and
every
time
that
i
have
had
a
to
create
the
personage
always
appears
before
me
dressed
from
head
to
foot
walking
bowing
sitting
down
getting
up
but
that
is
but
the
vision
of
a
second
my
mind
has
been
thinking
of
the
soul
that
is
to
govern
this
personage
when
listening
to
an
author
reading
his
work
i
try
to
define
the
intention
of
his
idea
in
my
desire
to
identify
myself
with
that
intention
i
have
never
played
an
author
false
with
regard
to
his
idea
and
i
have
always
tried
to
represent
the
personage
according
to
history
whenever
it
is
a
historical
personage
and
as
the
novelist
describes
it
if
an
invented
personage
i
have
sometimes
tried
to
compel
the
public
to
return
to
the
truth
and
to
destroy
the
legendary
side
of
certain
personages
whom
history
with
all
its
documents
now
represents
to
us
as
they
were
in
reality
but
the
public
never
followed
me
i
soon
realised
that
legend
remains
victorious
in
spite
of
history
and
this
is
perhaps
an
advantage
for
the
mind
of
the
people
jesus
joan
of
arc
shakespeare
the
virgin
mary
mahomet
and
napoleon
have
all
entered
into
legend
it
is
impossible
now
for
our
brain
to
picture
jesus
and
the
virgin
mary
accomplishing
humiliating
human
functions
they
lived
the
life
that
we
are
living
death
chilled
their
sacred
limbs
and
it
is
not
without
rebellion
and
grief
that
we
accept
this
fact
we
start
off
in
pursuit
of
them
in
an
ethereal
heaven
in
the
infinite
of
our
dreams
we
cast
aside
all
the
failings
of
humanity
in
order
to
leave
them
clothed
in
the
ideal
seated
on
a
throne
of
love
we
do
not
like
joan
of
arc
to
be
the
rustic
bold
peasant
girl
repulsing
violently
the
hardy
soldier
who
wants
to
joke
with
her
the
girl
sitting
astride
her
big
percheron
horse
like
a
man
laughing
readily
at
the
coarse
jokes
of
the
soldiers
submitting
to
the
lewd
promiscuities
of
the
barbarous
epoch
in
which
she
lived
and
having
on
that
account
all
the
more
merit
in
remaining
the
heroic
virgin
we
do
not
care
for
such
useless
truths
in
the
legend
she
is
a
fragile
woman
guided
by
a
divine
soul
her
girlish
arm
which
holds
the
heavy
banner
is
supported
by
an
invisible
angel
in
her
childish
eyes
there
is
something
from
another
world
and
it
is
from
this
that
all
the
warriors
drew
strength
and
courage
it
is
thus
that
we
wish
it
to
be
and
so
the
legend
remains
triumphant
x
my
first
engagement
at
the
comédie
française
but
to
return
to
the
conservatoire
nearly
all
the
pupils
had
gone
away
and
i
remained
quiet
and
embarrassed
on
my
bench
marie
lloyd
came
and
sat
down
by
me
you
unhappy
she
asked
i
answered
wanted
the
first
prize
and
you
have
it
it
is
not
do
not
know
whether
it
is
fair
or
not
answered
marie
lloyd
i
assure
you
that
it
is
not
my
i
could
not
help
laughing
at
this
i
come
home
with
you
to
luncheon
she
asked
and
her
beautiful
eyes
grew
moist
and
beseeching
she
was
an
orphan
and
unhappy
and
on
this
day
of
triumph
she
felt
the
need
of
a
family
my
heart
began
to
melt
with
pity
and
affection
i
threw
my
arms
round
her
neck
and
we
all
four
went
away
together
marie
lloyd
madame
guérard
mlle
de
brabender
and
i
my
mother
had
sent
me
word
that
she
had
gone
on
home
in
the
cab
my
character
won
the
day
once
more
and
we
chattered
about
every
one
how
ridiculous
such
and
such
a
person
was
you
see
her
bonnet
old
estebenet
did
you
see
his
white
gloves
he
must
have
stolen
them
from
some
policeman
and
hereupon
we
laughed
like
idiots
and
then
began
again
that
poor
châtelain
had
had
his
hair
curled
said
marie
lloyd
you
see
his
head
i
did
not
laugh
any
more
though
for
this
reminded
me
of
how
my
own
hair
had
been
uncurled
and
it
was
thanks
to
that
i
had
not
won
the
first
prize
for
tragedy
on
reaching
home
we
found
my
mother
my
aunt
my
godfather
our
old
friend
meydieu
madame
husband
and
my
sister
jeanne
with
her
hair
all
curled
this
gave
me
a
pang
for
she
had
straight
hair
and
it
had
been
curled
to
make
her
prettier
although
she
was
charming
without
that
and
the
curl
had
been
taken
out
of
my
hair
so
that
i
had
looked
uglier
my
mother
spoke
to
marie
lloyd
with
that
charming
and
distinguished
indifference
peculiar
to
her
my
godfather
made
a
great
fuss
of
her
for
success
was
everything
to
this
he
had
seen
my
young
friend
a
hundred
times
before
and
had
not
been
struck
by
her
beauty
nor
yet
touched
by
her
poverty
but
on
this
particular
day
he
assured
us
that
he
had
for
a
long
time
predicted
marie
triumph
he
then
came
to
me
put
his
two
hands
on
my
shoulders
and
held
me
facing
him
you
were
a
failure
he
said
persist
now
in
going
on
the
stage
you
are
thin
and
small
your
face
is
pretty
enough
when
near
but
ugly
in
the
distance
and
your
voice
does
not
carry
my
dear
girl
put
in
meydieu
godfather
is
right
you
had
better
marry
the
miller
who
proposed
or
that
imbecile
of
a
spanish
tanner
who
lost
his
brainless
head
for
the
sake
of
your
pretty
eyes
you
will
never
do
anything
on
the
stage
better
guérard
came
and
shook
hands
with
me
he
was
a
man
of
nearly
sixty
years
of
age
and
madame
guérard
was
under
thirty
he
was
melancholy
gentle
and
timid
he
had
been
awarded
the
red
ribbon
of
the
legion
of
honour
and
he
wore
a
long
shabby
frock
coat
used
aristocratic
gestures
and
was
private
secretary
to
de
la
tour
desmoulins
a
prominent
deputy
at
the
time
guérard
was
a
well
of
science
and
i
owe
much
to
his
kindness
my
sister
jeanne
whispered
to
me
godfather
said
when
he
came
in
that
you
looked
as
ugly
as
jeanne
always
spoke
of
my
godfather
in
this
way
i
pushed
her
away
and
we
sat
down
to
table
all
through
the
meal
my
one
wish
was
to
go
back
to
the
convent
i
did
not
eat
much
and
directly
after
luncheon
was
so
tired
that
i
had
to
go
to
bed
when
once
i
was
alone
in
my
room
between
the
sheets
with
tired
limbs
my
head
heavy
and
my
heart
oppressed
with
keeping
back
my
sighs
i
tried
to
consider
my
wretched
situation
but
sleep
the
great
restorer
came
to
the
rescue
and
i
was
very
soon
slumbering
peacefully
when
i
woke
i
could
not
collect
my
thoughts
at
first
i
wondered
what
time
it
was
and
looked
at
my
watch
it
was
just
ten
and
i
had
been
asleep
since
three
in
the
afternoon
i
listened
for
a
few
minutes
but
everything
was
silent
in
the
house
on
a
table
near
my
bed
was
a
small
tray
on
which
were
a
cup
of
chocolate
and
a
cake
a
sheet
of
writing
paper
was
placed
upright
against
the
cup
i
trembled
as
i
took
it
up
for
i
never
received
any
letters
with
great
difficulty
by
my
i
managed
to
read
the
following
words
written
by
madame
guérard
you
had
gone
to
sleep
the
duc
de
morny
sent
word
to
your
mother
that
camille
doucet
had
just
assured
him
that
you
were
to
be
engaged
at
the
comédie
française
do
not
worry
any
more
therefore
my
dear
child
but
have
faith
in
the
your
i
pinched
myself
to
make
sure
that
i
was
really
awake
i
got
up
and
rushed
to
the
window
i
looked
out
and
the
sky
was
black
yes
it
was
black
to
every
one
else
but
starry
to
me
the
stars
were
shining
and
i
looked
for
my
own
special
one
and
chose
the
largest
and
brightest
i
went
back
towards
my
bed
and
amused
myself
with
jumping
on
to
it
holding
my
feet
together
each
time
i
missed
i
laughed
like
a
lunatic
i
then
drank
my
chocolate
and
nearly
choked
myself
devouring
my
cake
standing
up
on
my
bolster
i
then
made
a
long
speech
to
the
virgin
mary
at
the
head
of
my
bed
i
adored
the
virgin
mary
and
i
explained
to
her
my
reasons
for
not
being
able
to
take
the
veil
in
spite
of
my
vocation
i
tried
to
charm
and
persuade
her
and
i
kissed
her
very
gently
on
her
foot
which
was
crushing
the
serpent
then
in
the
darkness
i
tried
to
find
my
portrait
i
could
scarcely
see
this
but
i
threw
kisses
to
it
i
then
took
up
again
the
letter
from
petit
and
went
to
sleep
with
it
clasped
in
my
hand
i
do
not
remember
what
my
dreams
were
the
next
day
every
one
was
very
kind
to
me
my
godfather
who
arrived
early
nodded
his
head
in
a
contented
way
must
have
some
fresh
air
he
said
will
treat
you
to
a
the
drive
seemed
to
me
delicious
for
i
could
dream
to
my
content
as
my
mother
disliked
talking
when
in
a
carriage
two
days
later
our
old
servant
marguerite
breathless
with
excitement
brought
me
a
letter
on
the
corner
of
the
envelope
there
was
a
large
stamp
around
which
stood
the
magic
words
i
glanced
at
my
mother
and
she
nodded
as
a
sign
that
i
might
open
the
letter
after
blaming
marguerite
for
handing
it
to
me
before
obtaining
her
permission
to
do
so
is
for
i
exclaimed
am
to
go
there
look
read
it
my
sisters
came
rushing
to
me
and
seized
my
hands
i
danced
round
with
them
singing
for
for
my
younger
sister
was
eight
years
old
but
i
was
only
six
that
day
i
went
upstairs
to
the
flat
above
to
tell
madame
guérard
she
was
just
soaping
her
white
frocks
and
pinafores
she
took
my
face
in
her
hands
and
kissed
me
affectionately
her
two
hands
were
covered
with
a
soapy
lather
and
left
a
snowy
patch
on
each
side
of
my
head
i
rushed
again
like
this
and
went
noisily
into
the
my
godfather
meydieu
my
aunt
and
my
mother
were
just
beginning
a
game
of
whist
i
kissed
each
of
them
leaving
a
patch
of
on
their
faces
at
which
i
laughed
heartily
but
i
was
allowed
to
do
anything
that
day
for
i
had
become
a
personage
the
next
day
tuesday
i
was
to
go
to
the
théâtre
français
at
one
to
see
thierry
who
was
then
director
what
was
i
to
wear
that
was
the
great
question
my
mother
had
sent
for
the
milliner
who
arrived
with
various
hats
i
chose
a
white
one
trimmed
with
pale
blue
a
white
and
blue
strings
aunt
rosine
had
sent
one
of
her
dresses
for
me
for
my
mother
thought
all
my
frocks
were
too
childish
oh
that
dress
i
shall
see
it
all
my
life
it
was
hideous
with
black
velvet
put
on
in
a
grecian
pattern
i
looked
like
a
monkey
in
that
dress
but
i
was
obliged
to
wear
it
fortunately
it
was
covered
by
a
mantle
of
black
stitched
all
round
with
white
it
was
thought
better
for
me
to
be
dressed
like
a
person
and
all
my
clothes
were
only
suitable
for
a
mlle
de
brabender
gave
me
a
handkerchief
that
she
had
embroidered
and
madame
guérard
a
sunshade
my
mother
gave
me
a
very
pretty
turquoise
ring
dressed
up
in
this
way
looking
pretty
in
my
white
hat
uncomfortable
in
my
green
dress
but
comforted
by
my
mantle
i
went
the
following
day
with
madame
guérard
to
my
aunt
lent
me
her
carriage
for
the
occasion
as
she
thought
it
would
look
better
to
arrive
in
a
private
carriage
later
on
i
heard
that
this
arrival
in
my
own
carriage
with
a
footman
made
a
very
bad
impression
what
all
the
theatre
people
thought
i
never
cared
to
consider
and
it
seems
to
me
that
my
extreme
youth
must
really
have
protected
me
from
all
suspicion
thierry
received
me
very
kindly
and
made
a
little
nonsensical
speech
he
then
unfolded
a
paper
which
he
handed
to
madame
guérard
asking
her
to
read
it
and
then
to
sign
it
this
paper
was
my
contract
and
petit
explained
that
she
was
not
my
mother
said
thierry
getting
up
will
you
take
it
with
you
and
have
it
signed
by
mother
he
then
took
my
hand
i
felt
an
instinctive
horror
at
his
for
it
was
flabby
and
there
was
no
life
or
sincerity
in
its
grasp
i
quickly
took
mine
away
and
looked
at
him
he
was
plain
with
a
red
face
and
eyes
that
avoided
gaze
as
i
was
going
away
i
met
coquelin
who
hearing
i
was
there
had
waited
to
see
me
he
had
made
his
a
year
before
with
great
success
settled
then
he
said
gaily
i
showed
him
the
contract
and
shook
hands
with
him
i
went
quickly
down
the
stairs
and
just
as
i
was
leaving
the
theatre
found
myself
in
the
midst
of
a
group
in
the
doorway
you
satisfied
asked
a
gentle
voice
which
i
recognised
as
yes
monsieur
thank
you
so
much
i
answered
my
dear
child
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
he
said
competition
was
not
at
all
good
but
nevertheless
we
feel
sure
of
you
put
in
régnier
and
then
turning
to
camille
doucet
he
asked
do
you
say
excellency
think
that
this
child
will
be
a
very
great
artist
he
replied
there
was
a
silence
for
a
moment
you
have
got
a
fine
carriage
exclaimed
beauvallet
rudely
he
was
the
first
tragedian
of
the
comédie
and
the
most
uncouth
man
in
france
or
anywhere
else
carriage
belongs
to
aunt
remarked
camille
doucet
shaking
hands
with
me
gently
well
i
am
glad
to
hear
that
answered
the
tragedian
i
then
stepped
into
the
carriage
which
had
caused
such
a
sensation
at
the
theatre
and
drove
away
on
reaching
home
i
took
the
contract
to
my
mother
she
signed
it
without
reading
it
i
made
my
mind
resolutely
to
be
some
one
a
few
days
after
my
engagement
at
the
comédie
française
my
aunt
gave
a
among
her
guests
were
the
duc
de
morny
camille
doucet
and
the
minister
of
fine
arts
de
walewski
rossini
my
mother
mlle
de
brabender
and
i
during
the
evening
a
great
many
other
people
came
my
mother
had
dressed
me
very
elegantly
and
it
was
the
first
time
i
had
worn
a
really
low
dress
oh
how
uncomfortable
i
was
every
one
paid
me
great
attention
rossini
asked
me
to
recite
some
poetry
and
i
consented
willingly
glad
and
proud
to
be
of
some
little
importance
i
chose
casimir
poem
du
should
be
spoken
with
music
as
an
accompaniment
exclaimed
rossini
when
i
came
to
an
end
every
one
approved
this
idea
and
walewski
said
will
begin
again
and
you
could
improvise
there
was
great
excitement
and
i
at
once
began
again
rossini
improvised
the
most
delightful
harmony
which
filled
me
with
emotion
my
tears
flowed
freely
without
my
being
conscious
of
them
and
at
the
end
my
mother
kissed
me
saying
is
the
first
time
that
you
have
really
moved
as
a
matter
of
fact
she
adored
music
and
it
was
improvisation
that
had
moved
her
the
comte
de
kératry
an
elegant
young
hussar
was
also
present
he
paid
me
great
compliments
and
invited
me
to
go
and
recite
some
poetry
at
his
house
my
aunt
then
sang
a
song
which
was
very
much
in
vogue
and
made
a
great
success
she
was
coquettish
and
charming
and
just
a
trifle
jealous
of
this
insignificant
niece
who
had
taken
up
the
attention
of
her
adorers
for
a
few
minutes
when
i
returned
home
i
was
quite
another
being
i
sat
down
dressed
as
i
was
on
my
bed
and
remained
for
a
long
time
deep
in
thought
hitherto
all
i
had
known
of
life
had
been
through
my
family
and
my
work
i
had
now
just
had
a
glimpse
of
it
through
society
and
i
was
struck
by
the
hypocrisy
of
some
of
the
people
and
the
conceit
of
others
i
began
to
wonder
uneasily
what
i
should
do
shy
and
frank
as
i
was
i
thought
of
my
mother
she
did
not
do
anything
though
she
was
indifferent
to
everything
i
thought
of
my
aunt
rosine
who
on
the
contrary
liked
to
mix
in
everything
i
remained
there
looking
down
on
the
ground
my
head
in
a
whirl
and
feeling
very
anxious
and
i
did
not
go
to
bed
until
i
was
thoroughly
chilled
the
next
few
days
passed
by
without
any
particular
events
i
was
working
hard
at
iphigénie
as
thierry
had
told
me
that
i
was
to
make
my
in
that
at
the
end
of
august
i
received
a
notice
requesting
me
to
attend
the
rehearsal
of
oh
that
first
notice
how
it
made
my
heart
beat
i
could
not
sleep
at
night
and
daylight
did
not
come
quickly
enough
for
me
i
kept
getting
up
to
look
at
the
time
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
clock
had
stopped
i
had
dozed
and
i
fancied
it
was
the
same
time
as
before
finally
a
streak
of
light
coming
through
my
was
i
thought
the
triumphant
sun
illuminating
my
room
i
got
up
at
once
pulled
back
the
curtains
and
mumbled
my
while
dressing
i
thought
of
my
rehearsing
with
madame
devoyod
the
leading
of
the
comédie
française
with
maubant
with
i
trembled
as
i
thought
of
all
this
for
madame
devoyod
was
said
to
be
anything
but
indulgent
i
arrived
for
the
rehearsal
an
hour
before
the
time
the
stage
manager
davenne
smiled
and
asked
me
whether
i
knew
my
yes
i
exclaimed
with
conviction
and
rehearse
it
would
you
like
to
and
he
took
me
to
the
stage
i
went
with
him
through
the
long
corridor
of
busts
which
leads
from
the
to
the
stage
he
told
me
the
names
of
the
celebrities
represented
by
these
busts
i
stood
still
a
moment
before
that
of
adrienne
lecouvreur
love
that
artiste
i
said
you
know
her
story
he
asked
i
have
read
all
that
has
been
written
about
right
my
child
said
the
worthy
man
ought
to
read
all
that
concerns
your
art
i
will
lend
you
some
interesting
he
took
me
towards
the
stage
the
mysterious
gloom
the
scenery
reared
up
like
fortifications
the
bareness
of
the
floor
the
endless
number
of
weights
ropes
trees
borders
battens
overhead
the
yawning
house
completely
dark
the
silence
broken
by
the
creaking
of
the
floor
and
the
chill
that
one
felt
all
this
together
awed
me
it
did
not
seem
to
me
as
if
i
were
entering
the
brilliant
ranks
of
living
artistes
who
every
night
won
the
applause
of
the
house
by
their
merriment
or
their
sobs
no
i
felt
as
though
i
were
in
the
tomb
of
dead
glories
and
the
stage
seemed
to
me
to
be
getting
crowded
with
the
illustrious
shadows
of
those
whom
the
stage
manager
had
just
mentioned
with
my
highly
strung
nerves
my
imagination
which
was
always
evoking
something
now
saw
them
advance
towards
me
stretching
out
their
hands
these
spectres
wanted
to
take
me
away
with
them
i
put
my
hands
over
my
eyes
and
stood
still
you
not
well
asked
davenne
yes
thank
you
it
was
just
a
little
his
voice
had
chased
away
the
spectres
and
i
opened
my
eyes
and
paid
attention
to
the
worthy
advice
book
in
hand
he
explained
to
me
where
i
was
to
stand
and
my
changes
of
place
he
was
rather
pleased
with
my
way
of
reciting
and
he
taught
me
a
few
of
the
traditions
at
the
line
à
conduisez
la
victime
he
said
favart
was
very
effective
the
artistes
gradually
began
to
arrive
grumbling
more
or
less
they
glanced
at
me
and
then
rehearsed
their
scenes
without
taking
any
notice
of
me
at
all
i
felt
inclined
to
cry
but
i
was
more
vexed
than
anything
else
i
heard
three
coarse
words
used
by
one
or
another
of
the
artistes
i
was
not
accustomed
to
this
somewhat
brutal
language
at
home
every
one
was
rather
timorous
at
my
people
were
a
trifle
affected
whilst
at
the
convent
it
is
unnecessary
to
say
i
had
never
heard
a
word
that
was
out
of
place
it
is
true
that
i
had
been
through
the
conservatoire
but
i
had
not
cultivated
any
of
the
pupils
with
the
exception
of
marie
lloyd
and
rose
baretta
the
elder
sister
of
blanche
baretta
who
is
now
a
sociétaire
of
the
comédie
française
when
the
rehearsal
was
over
it
was
decided
that
there
should
be
another
one
at
the
same
hour
the
following
day
in
the
public
foyer
the
came
in
search
of
me
as
she
wanted
to
try
on
my
costume
mlle
de
brabender
who
had
arrived
during
the
rehearsal
went
up
with
me
to
the
she
wanted
my
arms
to
be
covered
but
the
told
her
gently
that
this
was
impossible
in
tragedy
a
dress
of
white
woollen
material
was
tried
on
me
it
was
very
ugly
and
the
veil
was
so
stiff
that
i
refused
it
a
wreath
of
roses
was
tried
on
but
this
too
was
so
unsightly
that
i
refused
to
wear
it
then
mademoiselle
said
the
dryly
will
have
to
get
these
things
and
pay
for
them
yourself
as
this
is
the
costume
supplied
by
the
well
i
answered
blushing
will
get
them
on
returning
home
i
told
my
mother
my
troubles
and
as
she
was
always
very
generous
she
promptly
bought
me
a
veil
of
white
barège
that
fell
in
beautiful
large
soft
folds
and
a
wreath
of
hedge
roses
which
at
night
looked
very
soft
and
white
she
also
ordered
me
buskins
from
the
shoemaker
employed
by
the
comédie
the
next
thing
to
think
about
was
the
box
for
this
my
mother
had
recourse
to
the
mother
of
dica
petit
my
fellow
student
at
the
conservatoire
i
went
with
madame
dica
petit
to
massin
a
manufacturer
of
these
boxes
he
was
the
father
of
léontine
massin
another
conservatoire
pupil
we
went
up
to
the
sixth
floor
of
a
house
in
the
rue
réaumur
and
on
a
door
read
the
words
manufacturer
of
i
knocked
and
a
little
hunchback
girl
opened
the
door
i
recognised
sister
as
she
had
come
several
times
to
the
conservatoire
she
exclaimed
a
surprise
for
us
titine
she
then
called
out
is
mademoiselle
sarah
léontine
massin
came
running
out
of
the
next
room
she
was
a
pretty
girl
very
gentle
and
calm
in
demeanour
she
threw
her
arms
round
me
exclaiming
glad
i
am
to
see
you
and
so
you
are
going
to
make
your
début
at
the
comédie
i
saw
it
in
the
i
blushed
up
to
my
ears
at
the
idea
of
being
mentioned
in
the
papers
am
engaged
at
the
variétés
she
said
and
then
she
talked
away
at
such
a
rate
that
i
was
bewildered
madame
petit
did
not
enter
into
all
this
and
tried
in
vain
to
separate
us
she
had
replied
by
a
nod
and
an
indifferent
to
inquiries
about
her
health
finally
when
the
young
girl
had
finished
saying
all
she
had
to
say
madame
petit
remarked
must
order
your
box
we
have
come
here
for
that
you
you
will
find
my
father
in
his
workshop
at
the
end
of
the
passage
and
if
you
are
not
very
long
i
shall
still
be
here
i
am
going
to
rehearsal
at
the
variétés
later
madame
petit
was
furious
for
she
did
not
like
léontine
massin
wait
mademoiselle
she
said
will
be
impossible
for
us
to
stay
léontine
was
annoyed
and
shrugging
her
shoulders
turned
her
back
on
my
companion
she
then
put
her
hat
on
kissed
me
and
bowing
gravely
to
madame
petit
said
hope
madame
i
shall
never
see
you
she
then
ran
off
laughing
merrily
i
heard
madame
petit
mutter
a
few
disagreeable
words
in
dutch
but
the
meaning
of
them
was
only
explained
to
me
later
on
we
then
went
to
the
workshop
and
found
old
massin
at
his
bench
planing
some
small
planks
of
white
wood
his
daughter
kept
coming
in
and
out
humming
gaily
all
the
time
the
father
was
glum
and
harsh
and
had
an
anxious
look
as
soon
as
we
had
ordered
the
box
we
took
our
leave
madame
petit
went
out
first
sister
held
me
back
by
the
hand
and
said
quietly
is
not
very
polite
but
it
is
because
he
is
jealous
he
wanted
my
sister
to
be
at
the
théâtre
i
was
rather
disturbed
by
this
confidence
and
i
had
a
vague
idea
of
the
painful
drama
which
was
acting
so
differently
on
the
various
members
of
this
humble
home
xi
my
début
at
the
house
of
molière
and
my
first
departure
therefrom
on
september
the
day
i
was
to
make
my
i
was
in
the
rue
duphot
looking
at
the
theatrical
posters
they
used
to
be
put
up
then
at
the
corner
of
the
rue
duphot
and
the
rue
honoré
on
the
poster
of
the
comédie
française
i
read
the
words
of
mlle
sarah
i
have
no
idea
how
long
i
stood
there
fascinated
by
the
letters
of
my
name
but
i
remember
that
it
seemed
to
me
as
though
every
person
who
stopped
to
read
the
poster
looked
at
me
afterwards
and
i
blushed
to
the
very
roots
of
my
hair
at
five
i
went
to
the
theatre
i
had
a
on
the
top
floor
which
i
shared
with
mlle
coblentz
this
room
was
on
the
other
side
of
the
rue
de
richelieu
in
a
house
rented
by
the
comédie
française
a
small
covered
bridge
over
the
street
served
as
a
passage
and
means
of
communication
for
us
to
reach
the
comédie
i
was
a
tremendously
long
time
dressing
and
did
not
know
whether
i
looked
nice
or
not
petit
thought
i
was
too
pale
and
mlle
de
brabender
considered
that
i
had
too
much
colour
my
mother
was
to
go
direct
to
her
seat
in
the
theatre
and
aunt
rosine
was
away
in
the
country
when
the
announced
that
the
play
was
about
to
begin
i
broke
into
a
cold
perspiration
from
head
to
foot
and
felt
ready
to
faint
i
went
downstairs
trembling
tottering
and
my
teeth
chattering
when
i
arrived
on
the
stage
the
curtain
was
rising
that
curtain
which
was
being
raised
so
slowly
and
solemnly
was
to
me
like
the
veil
being
torn
which
was
to
let
me
have
a
glimpse
of
my
future
a
deep
gentle
voice
made
me
turn
round
it
was
provost
my
first
professor
who
had
come
to
encourage
me
i
greeted
him
warmly
so
glad
was
i
to
see
him
again
samson
was
there
too
i
believe
that
he
was
playing
that
night
in
one
of
comedies
the
two
men
were
very
different
provost
was
tall
his
silvery
hair
was
blown
about
and
he
had
a
droll
face
samson
was
small
precise
dainty
his
shiny
white
hair
curled
firmly
and
closely
round
his
head
both
men
had
been
moved
by
the
same
sentiment
of
protection
for
the
poor
fragile
nervous
girl
who
was
nevertheless
so
full
of
hope
both
of
them
knew
my
zeal
for
work
my
obstinate
will
which
was
always
struggling
for
victory
over
my
physical
weakness
they
knew
that
my
motto
had
not
been
adopted
by
me
merely
by
chance
but
that
it
was
the
outcome
of
a
deliberate
exercise
of
will
power
on
my
part
my
mother
had
told
them
how
i
had
chosen
this
motto
at
the
age
of
nine
after
a
formidable
leap
over
a
ditch
which
no
one
could
jump
and
which
my
young
cousin
had
dared
me
to
attempt
i
had
hurt
my
face
broken
my
wrist
and
was
in
pain
all
over
whilst
i
was
being
carried
home
i
exclaimed
furiously
i
would
do
it
again
if
any
one
dared
me
again
and
i
will
always
do
what
i
want
to
do
all
my
in
the
evening
of
that
day
my
aunt
who
was
grieved
to
see
me
in
such
pain
asked
me
what
would
give
me
any
pleasure
my
poor
little
body
was
all
bandaged
but
i
jumped
with
joy
at
this
and
quite
consoled
i
whispered
in
a
coaxing
way
should
like
to
have
some
with
a
motto
of
my
my
mother
asked
me
rather
slyly
what
my
motto
was
i
did
not
answer
for
a
minute
and
then
as
they
were
all
waiting
quietly
i
uttered
such
a
furious
that
my
aunt
faure
started
back
exclaiming
a
terrible
child
samson
and
provost
reminded
me
of
this
story
in
order
to
give
me
courage
but
my
ears
were
buzzing
so
that
i
could
not
listen
to
them
provost
heard
my
on
the
stage
and
pushed
me
gently
forward
i
made
my
entry
and
hurried
towards
agamemnon
my
father
i
did
not
want
to
leave
him
again
as
i
felt
i
must
have
some
one
to
hold
on
to
i
then
rushed
to
my
mother
clytemnestra
i
stammered
and
on
leaving
the
stage
i
rushed
up
to
my
room
and
began
to
undress
madame
guérard
was
terrified
and
asked
me
if
i
was
mad
i
had
only
played
one
act
and
there
were
four
more
i
realised
then
that
it
would
really
be
dangerous
to
give
way
to
my
nerves
i
had
recourse
to
my
own
motto
and
standing
in
front
of
the
glass
gazing
into
my
own
eyes
i
ordered
myself
to
be
calm
and
to
conquer
myself
and
my
nerves
in
a
state
of
confusion
yielded
to
my
brain
i
got
through
the
play
but
was
very
insignificant
in
my
part
the
next
morning
my
mother
sent
for
me
early
she
had
been
looking
at
article
in
nationale
and
she
now
read
me
the
following
lines
bernhardt
who
made
her
yesterday
in
the
of
iphigénie
is
a
tall
pretty
girl
with
a
slender
figure
and
a
very
pleasing
expression
the
upper
part
of
her
face
is
remarkably
beautiful
her
carriage
is
excellent
and
her
enunciation
is
perfectly
clear
this
is
all
that
can
be
said
for
her
at
man
is
an
idiot
said
my
mother
drawing
me
to
her
were
she
then
prepared
a
little
cup
of
coffee
for
me
and
made
it
with
cream
i
was
happy
but
not
completely
so
when
my
godfather
arrived
in
the
afternoon
he
exclaimed
heavens
my
poor
child
what
thin
arms
you
have
as
a
matter
of
fact
people
had
laughed
and
i
had
heard
them
when
stretching
out
my
arms
towards
eurybate
i
had
said
the
famous
line
in
which
favart
had
made
her
that
was
now
a
tradition
i
certainly
had
made
no
unless
the
smiles
caused
by
my
long
thin
arms
can
be
reckoned
as
such
my
second
appearance
was
in
when
i
did
make
some
slight
success
my
third
appearance
at
the
comédie
resulted
in
the
following
from
the
pen
of
the
same
sarcey
september
same
evening
femmes
was
given
this
was
mlle
third
and
she
assumed
the
of
henriette
she
was
just
as
pretty
and
insignificant
in
this
as
in
that
of
junie
he
had
made
a
mistake
as
it
was
iphigénie
i
had
played
and
of
valérie
both
of
which
had
been
entrusted
to
her
previously
this
performance
was
a
very
poor
affair
and
gives
rise
to
reflections
by
no
means
gay
that
mlle
bernhardt
should
be
insignificant
does
not
much
matter
she
is
a
and
among
the
number
presented
to
us
it
is
only
natural
that
some
should
be
failures
the
pitiful
part
is
though
that
the
comedians
playing
with
her
were
not
much
better
than
she
was
and
they
are
sociétaires
of
the
théâtre
français
all
that
they
had
more
than
their
young
comrade
was
a
greater
familiarity
with
the
boards
they
are
just
as
mlle
bernhardt
may
be
in
twenty
time
if
she
stays
at
the
comédie
i
did
not
stay
there
though
for
one
of
those
nothings
which
change
a
whole
life
changed
mine
i
had
entered
the
comédie
expecting
to
remain
there
always
i
had
heard
my
godfather
explain
to
my
mother
all
about
the
various
stages
of
my
career
child
will
have
so
much
during
the
first
five
years
he
said
so
much
afterwards
and
then
at
the
end
of
thirty
years
she
will
have
the
pension
given
to
sociétaires
that
is
if
she
ever
becomes
a
he
appeared
to
have
his
doubts
about
that
my
sister
régina
was
the
cause
though
quite
involuntarily
this
time
of
the
drama
which
made
me
leave
the
comédie
it
was
anniversary
and
all
the
artistes
of
the
français
salute
the
bust
of
the
great
writer
according
to
the
tradition
of
the
theatre
it
was
to
be
my
first
appearance
at
a
and
my
little
sister
on
hearing
me
tell
about
it
at
home
besought
me
to
take
her
to
it
my
mother
gave
me
permission
to
do
so
and
our
old
marguerite
was
to
accompany
us
all
the
members
of
the
comédie
were
assembled
in
the
the
men
and
women
dressed
in
different
costumes
all
wore
the
famous
cloak
the
signal
was
given
that
the
ceremony
was
about
to
commence
and
every
one
hurried
along
the
corridor
of
the
busts
i
was
holding
my
little
hand
and
just
in
front
of
us
was
the
very
fat
and
very
solemn
madame
nathalie
she
was
a
sociétaire
of
the
comédie
old
spiteful
and
surly
régina
in
trying
to
avoid
the
train
of
marie
cloak
stepped
on
to
and
the
latter
turned
round
and
gave
the
child
such
a
violent
push
that
she
was
knocked
against
a
column
on
which
was
a
bust
régina
screamed
out
and
as
she
turned
back
to
me
i
saw
that
her
pretty
face
was
bleeding
miserable
creature
i
called
out
to
the
fat
woman
and
as
she
turned
round
to
reply
i
slapped
her
in
the
face
she
proceeded
to
faint
there
was
a
great
tumult
and
an
uproar
of
indignation
approval
stifled
laughter
satisfied
revenge
pity
for
the
poor
child
from
those
artistes
who
were
mothers
two
groups
were
formed
one
around
the
wretched
nathalie
who
was
still
in
her
swoon
and
the
other
around
little
régina
and
the
different
aspect
of
these
two
groups
was
rather
strange
around
nathalie
were
cold
men
and
women
fanning
the
fat
helpless
lump
with
their
or
fans
a
young
but
sociétaire
was
sprinkling
her
with
drops
of
water
nathalie
on
feeling
this
roused
up
suddenly
put
her
hands
over
her
face
and
muttered
in
a
voice
stupid
spoil
my
the
younger
men
were
stooping
over
régina
washing
her
pretty
face
and
the
child
was
saying
in
her
broken
voice
did
not
do
it
on
purpose
sister
i
am
certain
i
an
old
cow
and
she
just
kicked
for
nothing
at
all
régina
was
a
seraph
who
might
have
made
the
angels
envious
for
she
had
the
most
ideal
and
poetical
beauty
but
her
language
was
by
no
means
choice
and
nothing
in
the
world
could
change
it
her
coarse
speech
made
the
friendly
group
burst
out
laughing
while
all
the
members
of
the
camp
shrugged
their
shoulders
bressant
who
was
the
most
charming
of
the
comedians
and
a
general
favourite
came
up
to
me
and
said
must
arrange
this
little
matter
dear
mademoiselle
for
short
arms
are
really
very
long
between
ourselves
you
were
a
trifle
hasty
but
i
like
that
and
then
that
child
is
so
droll
and
so
pretty
he
added
pointing
to
my
little
sister
the
house
was
stamping
with
impatience
for
this
little
scene
had
caused
twenty
delay
and
we
were
obliged
to
go
on
to
the
stage
at
once
marie
roger
kissed
me
saying
are
a
plucky
little
comrade
rose
baretta
drew
me
to
her
murmuring
dared
you
do
it
she
is
a
sociétaire
as
for
me
i
was
not
very
conscious
as
to
what
i
had
done
but
my
instinct
warned
me
that
i
should
pay
dearly
for
it
the
following
day
i
received
a
letter
from
the
manager
asking
me
to
call
at
the
comédie
at
one
about
a
matter
concerning
me
privately
i
had
been
crying
all
night
long
more
through
nervous
excitement
than
from
remorse
and
i
was
particularly
annoyed
at
the
idea
of
the
attacks
i
should
have
to
endure
from
my
own
family
i
did
not
let
my
mother
see
the
letter
for
from
the
day
that
i
had
entered
the
comédie
i
had
been
emancipated
i
received
my
letters
now
direct
without
her
supervision
and
i
went
about
alone
at
one
precisely
i
was
shown
into
the
office
thierry
his
nose
more
congested
than
ever
and
his
eyes
more
crafty
preached
me
a
deadly
sermon
blamed
my
want
of
discipline
absence
of
respect
and
scandalous
conduct
and
finished
his
pitiful
harangue
by
advising
me
to
beg
madame
pardon
have
asked
her
to
come
he
added
you
must
apologise
to
her
before
three
sociétaires
members
of
the
committee
if
she
consents
to
forgive
you
the
committee
will
then
consider
whether
to
fine
you
or
to
cancel
your
i
did
not
reply
for
a
few
minutes
i
thought
of
my
mother
in
distress
my
godfather
laughing
in
his
bourgeois
way
and
my
aunt
faure
triumphant
with
her
usual
phrase
child
is
terrible
i
thought
too
of
my
beloved
brabender
with
her
hands
clasped
her
moustache
drooping
sadly
her
small
eyes
full
of
tears
so
touching
in
their
mute
supplication
i
could
hear
my
gentle
timid
madame
guérard
arguing
with
every
one
so
courageous
was
she
always
in
her
confidence
in
my
future
mademoiselle
said
thierry
curtly
i
looked
at
him
without
speaking
and
he
began
to
get
impatient
will
go
and
ask
madame
nathalie
to
come
here
he
said
i
beg
you
will
do
your
part
as
quickly
as
possible
for
i
have
other
things
to
attend
to
than
to
put
your
blunders
no
do
not
fetch
madame
nathalie
i
said
at
last
shall
not
apologise
to
her
i
will
leave
i
will
cancel
my
engagement
at
he
was
stupefied
and
his
arrogance
melted
away
in
pity
for
the
ungovernable
wilful
child
who
was
about
to
ruin
her
whole
future
for
the
sake
of
a
question
of
he
was
at
once
gentler
and
more
polite
he
asked
me
to
sit
down
which
he
had
not
hitherto
done
and
he
sat
down
himself
opposite
to
me
and
spoke
to
me
gently
about
the
advantages
of
the
comédie
and
of
the
danger
that
there
would
be
for
me
in
leaving
that
illustrious
theatre
which
had
done
me
the
honour
of
admitting
me
he
gave
me
a
hundred
other
very
good
wise
reasons
which
softened
me
when
he
saw
the
effect
he
had
made
he
wanted
to
send
for
madame
nathalie
but
i
roused
up
then
like
a
little
wild
animal
let
her
come
here
i
should
box
her
ears
again
i
exclaimed
then
i
must
ask
your
mother
to
come
he
said
mother
would
never
come
i
said
i
will
go
and
call
on
her
he
remarked
will
be
quite
useless
i
persisted
mother
has
emancipated
me
and
i
am
quite
free
to
lead
my
own
life
i
alone
am
responsible
for
all
that
i
then
mademoiselle
i
will
think
it
over
he
said
rising
to
show
me
that
the
interview
was
at
an
end
i
went
back
home
determined
to
say
nothing
to
my
mother
but
my
little
sister
when
questioned
about
her
wound
had
told
everything
in
her
own
way
exaggerating
if
possible
the
brutality
of
madame
nathalie
and
the
audacity
of
what
i
had
done
rose
baretta
too
had
been
to
see
me
and
had
burst
into
tears
assuring
my
mother
that
my
engagement
would
be
cancelled
the
whole
family
was
very
much
excited
and
distressed
when
i
arrived
and
when
they
began
to
argue
with
me
it
made
me
still
more
nervous
i
did
not
take
calmly
the
reproaches
which
one
and
another
of
them
addressed
to
me
and
i
was
not
at
all
willing
to
follow
their
advice
i
went
to
my
room
and
locked
myself
in
the
following
day
no
one
spoke
to
me
and
i
went
up
to
madame
guérarde
comforted
and
consoled
several
days
passed
by
and
i
had
nothing
to
do
at
the
theatre
finally
one
morning
i
received
a
notice
requesting
me
to
be
present
at
the
reading
of
a
play
dolores
by
bouilhet
this
was
the
first
time
i
had
been
asked
to
attend
the
reading
of
a
new
piece
i
was
evidently
to
have
a
rôle
to
all
my
sorrows
were
at
once
dispersed
like
a
cloud
of
butterflies
i
told
my
mother
of
my
joy
and
she
naturally
concluded
that
as
i
was
asked
to
attend
a
reading
my
engagement
was
not
to
be
cancelled
and
i
was
not
to
be
asked
again
to
apologise
to
madame
nathalie
i
went
to
the
theatre
and
to
my
utter
surprise
i
received
from
davennes
the
rôle
of
dolores
the
chief
part
in
play
i
knew
that
favart
who
should
have
had
this
rôle
was
not
well
but
there
were
other
artistes
and
i
could
not
get
over
my
joy
and
surprise
nevertheless
i
felt
somewhat
uneasy
a
terrible
presentiment
has
always
warned
me
of
any
troubles
about
to
come
upon
me
i
had
been
rehearsing
for
five
days
when
one
morning
on
going
upstairs
i
suddenly
found
myself
face
to
face
with
nathalie
seated
under
portrait
of
rachel
known
as
red
i
did
not
know
whether
to
go
downstairs
again
or
to
pass
by
my
hesitation
was
noticed
by
the
spiteful
woman
you
can
pass
mademoiselle
she
said
have
forgiven
you
as
i
have
avenged
myself
the
that
you
like
so
much
is
not
going
to
be
for
you
after
i
went
by
without
uttering
a
word
i
was
thunderstruck
by
her
speech
which
i
guessed
would
prove
true
i
did
not
mention
this
incident
to
any
one
but
continued
rehearsing
it
was
on
tuesday
that
nathalie
had
spoken
to
me
and
on
friday
i
was
disappointed
to
hear
that
davennes
was
not
there
and
that
there
was
to
be
no
rehearsal
just
as
i
was
getting
into
my
cab
the
ran
out
to
give
me
a
letter
from
davennes
the
poor
man
had
not
ventured
to
come
himself
and
give
me
the
news
which
he
was
sure
would
be
so
painful
to
me
he
explained
to
me
in
his
letter
that
on
account
of
my
extreme
youth
the
importance
of
the
such
responsibility
for
my
young
shoulders
and
finally
that
as
madame
favart
had
recovered
from
her
illness
it
was
more
prudent
that
i
finished
reading
the
letter
through
blinding
tears
but
very
soon
anger
took
the
place
of
grief
i
rushed
back
again
and
sent
my
name
in
to
the
office
he
could
not
see
me
just
then
but
i
said
i
would
wait
after
one
hour
thoroughly
impatient
taking
no
notice
of
the
and
the
secretary
who
wanted
to
prevent
my
entering
i
opened
the
door
of
office
and
walked
in
all
that
despair
anger
against
injustice
and
fury
against
falseness
could
inspire
me
with
i
let
him
have
in
a
stream
of
eloquence
only
interrupted
by
my
sobs
the
manager
gazed
at
me
in
bewilderment
he
could
not
conceive
of
such
daring
and
such
violence
in
a
girl
so
young
when
at
last
thoroughly
exhausted
i
sank
down
in
an
he
tried
to
calm
me
but
all
in
vain
will
leave
at
once
i
said
me
back
my
contract
and
i
will
send
you
back
finally
tired
of
argument
and
persuasion
he
called
his
secretary
and
gave
him
the
necessary
orders
and
the
latter
soon
brought
in
my
contract
is
your
signature
mademoiselle
i
leave
you
free
to
bring
it
me
back
within
hours
after
that
time
if
i
do
not
receive
it
i
shall
consider
that
you
are
no
longer
a
member
of
the
theatre
but
believe
me
you
are
acting
unwisely
think
it
over
during
the
next
i
did
not
answer
but
went
out
of
his
office
that
very
evening
i
sent
back
to
thierry
the
contract
bearing
his
signature
and
tore
up
the
one
with
that
of
my
mother
i
had
left
theatre
and
was
not
to
it
until
twelve
years
later
xii
at
the
gymnase
theatre
a
trip
to
spain
this
proceeding
of
mine
was
certainly
violently
decisive
and
it
completely
upset
my
home
life
i
was
not
happy
from
this
time
forth
amongst
my
own
people
as
i
was
continually
being
blamed
for
my
violence
irritating
remarks
with
a
double
meaning
were
constantly
being
made
by
my
aunt
and
my
little
sister
my
godfather
whom
i
had
once
for
all
requested
to
mind
his
own
business
no
longer
dared
to
attack
me
openly
but
he
influenced
my
mother
against
me
there
was
no
longer
any
peace
for
me
except
at
madame
so
i
was
constantly
with
her
i
enjoyed
helping
her
in
her
domestic
affairs
she
taught
me
to
make
cakes
chocolate
and
scrambled
eggs
all
this
gave
me
something
else
to
think
about
and
i
soon
recovered
my
gaiety
one
morning
there
was
something
very
mysterious
about
my
mother
she
kept
looking
at
the
clock
and
seemed
uneasy
because
my
godfather
who
lunched
and
dined
with
us
every
day
had
not
arrived
very
strange
my
mother
said
last
night
after
whist
he
said
he
should
be
with
us
this
morning
before
luncheon
very
strange
indeed
she
was
usually
calm
but
she
kept
coming
in
and
out
of
the
room
and
when
marguerite
put
her
head
in
at
the
door
to
ask
whether
she
should
serve
the
luncheon
my
mother
told
her
to
wait
finally
the
bell
rang
startling
my
mother
and
jeanne
my
little
sister
was
evidently
in
the
secret
settled
exclaimed
my
godfather
shaking
the
snow
from
his
hat
read
that
you
he
handed
me
a
letter
stamped
with
the
words
du
it
was
from
montigny
the
manager
of
the
theatre
to
de
gerbois
a
friend
of
my
whom
i
knew
very
well
the
letter
was
very
friendly
as
far
as
de
gerbois
was
concerned
but
it
finished
with
the
following
words
will
engage
your
in
order
to
be
agreeable
to
you
but
she
appears
to
me
to
have
a
vile
i
blushed
as
i
read
these
lines
and
i
thought
my
godfather
was
wanting
in
tact
as
he
might
have
given
me
real
delight
and
avoided
hurting
my
feelings
in
this
way
but
he
was
the
man
that
ever
lived
my
mother
seemed
very
much
pleased
so
i
kissed
her
pretty
face
and
thanked
my
godfather
oh
how
i
loved
kissing
that
pearly
face
which
was
always
so
cool
and
always
slightly
dewy
when
i
was
a
little
child
i
used
to
ask
her
to
play
at
butterfly
on
my
cheeks
with
her
long
lashes
and
she
would
put
her
face
close
to
mine
and
open
and
shut
her
eyes
tickling
my
cheeks
whilst
i
lay
back
breathless
with
delight
the
following
day
i
went
to
the
gymnase
i
was
kept
waiting
for
some
little
time
together
with
about
fifty
other
girls
monval
a
cynical
old
man
who
was
stage
manager
and
almost
general
manager
then
interviewed
us
i
liked
him
at
first
because
he
was
like
guérard
i
very
soon
disliked
him
his
way
of
looking
at
me
of
speaking
to
me
and
of
taking
stock
of
me
generally
roused
my
ire
at
once
i
answered
his
questions
curtly
and
our
conversation
which
seemed
likely
to
take
an
aggressive
turn
was
cut
short
by
the
arrival
of
montigny
the
manager
of
you
is
mademoiselle
sarah
bernhardt
he
asked
i
at
once
rose
and
he
continued
you
come
into
my
office
mademoiselle
montigny
had
been
an
actor
and
was
plump
and
he
appeared
to
be
somewhat
infatuated
with
his
own
personality
with
his
ego
but
that
did
not
matter
to
me
after
some
friendly
conversation
he
preached
a
little
to
me
about
my
outburst
at
the
comédie
made
me
a
great
many
promises
about
the
i
should
have
to
play
he
prepared
my
contract
and
gave
it
me
to
take
home
for
my
signature
and
that
of
my
family
council
am
emancipated
i
said
to
him
that
my
own
signature
is
all
that
is
very
good
he
said
what
nonsense
to
have
emancipated
a
girl
your
parents
did
not
do
you
a
good
turn
by
i
was
just
on
the
point
of
replying
that
what
my
parents
chose
to
do
did
not
concern
him
but
i
held
my
peace
signed
the
contract
and
hurried
home
feeling
very
joyful
montigny
kept
his
word
at
first
he
let
me
understudy
victoria
lafontaine
a
young
artist
very
much
in
vogue
just
then
who
had
the
most
delightful
talent
i
played
in
maison
sans
and
i
took
her
at
a
notice
in
démon
du
a
piece
which
made
a
great
success
i
was
fairly
good
in
both
plays
but
montigny
in
spite
of
my
entreaties
never
came
to
see
me
in
them
and
the
spiteful
stage
manager
played
me
no
end
of
tricks
i
used
to
feel
a
sullen
anger
stirring
within
me
and
i
struggled
with
myself
as
much
possible
to
keep
my
nerves
calm
one
evening
on
leaving
the
theatre
a
notice
was
handed
to
me
requesting
me
to
be
present
at
the
reading
of
a
play
the
following
day
montigny
had
promised
me
a
good
part
and
i
fell
asleep
that
night
lulled
by
fairies
who
carried
me
off
into
the
land
of
glory
and
success
on
arriving
at
the
theatre
i
found
blanche
pierson
and
céline
montalant
already
there
two
of
the
prettiest
creatures
that
god
has
been
pleased
to
create
the
one
as
fair
as
the
rising
sun
and
the
other
as
dark
as
a
starry
night
for
she
was
in
spite
of
her
black
hair
there
were
other
women
there
too
very
very
pretty
ones
the
play
to
be
read
was
entitled
mari
qui
lance
sa
and
it
was
by
raymond
deslandes
i
listened
to
it
without
any
great
pleasure
and
i
thought
it
stupid
i
waited
anxiously
to
see
what
was
to
be
given
to
me
and
i
discovered
this
only
too
soon
it
was
a
certain
princess
dimchinka
a
frivolous
foolish
laughing
individual
who
was
always
eating
or
dancing
i
did
not
like
the
part
at
all
i
was
very
inexperienced
on
the
stage
and
my
timidity
made
me
rather
awkward
besides
i
had
not
worked
for
three
years
with
such
persistency
and
conviction
in
order
to
create
the
of
an
idiotic
woman
in
an
imbecile
play
i
was
in
despair
and
the
wildest
ideas
came
into
my
head
i
wanted
to
give
up
the
stage
and
go
into
business
i
spoke
of
this
to
our
old
family
friend
meydieu
who
was
so
unbearable
he
approved
of
my
idea
and
wanted
me
to
take
a
shop
a
on
the
boulevard
des
italiens
this
became
a
fixed
idea
with
the
worthy
man
he
loved
sweets
himself
and
he
knew
lots
of
recipes
for
various
sorts
of
sweets
that
were
not
generally
known
and
which
he
wanted
to
introduce
i
remember
one
kind
that
he
wanted
to
call
it
was
a
mixture
of
chocolate
and
essence
of
coffee
rolled
into
grilled
licorice
root
it
was
like
black
and
was
extremely
good
i
was
very
persistent
in
this
idea
at
first
and
went
with
meydieu
to
look
at
a
shop
but
when
he
showed
me
the
little
flat
over
it
where
i
should
have
to
live
it
upset
me
so
much
that
i
gave
up
for
ever
the
idea
of
business
i
went
every
day
to
the
rehearsal
of
the
stupid
piece
and
was
all
the
time
finally
the
first
performance
took
place
and
my
part
was
neither
a
success
nor
a
failure
i
simply
was
not
noticed
and
at
night
my
mother
remarked
poor
child
you
were
ridiculous
in
your
russian
princess
and
i
was
very
much
grieved
i
did
not
answer
at
all
but
i
should
honestly
have
liked
to
kill
myself
i
slept
very
badly
that
night
and
towards
six
in
the
morning
i
rushed
up
to
madame
guérard
i
asked
her
to
give
me
some
laudanum
but
she
refused
when
she
saw
that
i
really
wanted
it
the
poor
dear
woman
understood
my
design
then
i
said
by
your
children
that
you
will
not
tell
any
one
what
i
am
going
to
do
and
then
i
will
not
kill
a
sudden
idea
had
just
come
into
my
mind
and
without
going
further
into
it
i
wanted
to
carry
it
out
at
once
she
promised
and
i
then
told
her
that
i
was
going
at
once
to
spain
as
i
had
longed
to
see
that
country
for
a
long
time
to
spain
she
exclaimed
whom
and
when
the
money
i
have
saved
i
answered
this
very
morning
every
one
is
asleep
at
home
i
shall
go
and
pack
my
trunk
and
start
at
once
with
you
no
i
can
not
go
exclaimed
madame
guérard
nearly
beside
herself
is
my
husband
to
think
of
and
my
her
little
girl
was
scarcely
two
years
old
at
that
time
then
petit
find
me
some
one
to
go
with
do
not
know
any
one
she
answered
crying
in
her
excitement
dear
little
sarah
give
up
such
an
idea
i
beseech
but
by
this
time
it
was
a
fixed
idea
with
me
and
i
was
very
determined
about
it
i
went
downstairs
packed
my
trunk
and
then
returned
to
madame
guérard
i
had
wrapped
up
a
pewter
fork
in
paper
and
this
i
threw
against
one
of
the
panes
of
glass
in
a
skylight
window
opposite
the
window
was
opened
abruptly
and
the
sleepy
angry
face
of
a
young
woman
appeared
i
made
a
trumpet
of
my
two
hands
and
called
out
will
you
start
with
me
at
once
for
spain
the
bewildered
expression
on
the
face
showed
that
she
had
not
comprehended
but
she
replied
at
once
am
coming
she
then
closed
her
window
and
ten
minutes
later
caroline
was
tapping
at
the
door
madame
guérard
had
sunk
down
aghast
in
an
guérard
had
asked
several
times
from
his
bedroom
what
was
going
on
is
here
his
wife
had
replied
will
tell
you
later
caroline
did
dressmaking
by
the
day
at
madame
and
she
had
offered
her
services
to
me
as
maid
she
was
agreeable
and
rather
daring
and
she
now
accepted
my
offer
at
once
but
as
it
would
not
do
to
arouse
the
suspicions
of
the
concierge
it
was
decided
that
i
should
take
her
dresses
in
my
trunk
and
that
she
should
put
her
linen
into
a
bag
to
be
lent
by
petit
poor
dear
madame
guérard
had
given
in
she
was
quite
conquered
and
soon
began
to
help
in
my
preparations
which
certainly
did
not
take
me
long
but
i
did
not
know
how
to
get
to
spain
go
through
bordeaux
said
madame
guérard
no
exclaimed
caroline
is
a
skipper
and
he
often
goes
to
spain
by
i
had
saved
nine
hundred
francs
and
madame
guérard
lent
me
six
hundred
it
was
perfectly
mad
but
i
felt
ready
to
conquer
the
universe
and
nothing
would
have
induced
me
to
abandon
my
plan
then
too
it
seemed
to
me
as
though
i
had
been
wishing
to
see
spain
for
a
long
time
i
had
got
it
into
my
head
that
my
fate
willed
it
that
i
must
obey
my
star
and
a
hundred
other
ideas
each
one
more
foolish
than
the
other
strengthened
me
in
my
plan
i
was
destined
to
act
in
this
way
i
thought
i
went
downstairs
again
the
door
was
still
ajar
with
help
i
carried
the
empty
trunk
up
to
madame
and
caroline
emptied
my
wardrobe
and
drawers
and
then
packed
the
trunk
i
shall
never
forget
that
delightful
moment
it
seemed
to
me
as
though
the
world
was
about
to
be
mine
i
was
going
to
start
off
with
a
woman
to
wait
on
me
i
was
about
to
travel
alone
with
no
one
to
criticise
what
i
decided
to
do
i
should
see
an
unknown
country
about
which
i
had
dreamed
and
i
should
cross
the
sea
oh
how
happy
i
was
twenty
times
i
must
have
gone
up
and
down
the
staircase
which
separated
our
two
flats
every
one
was
asleep
in
my
flat
and
the
rooms
were
so
disposed
that
not
a
sound
of
our
going
in
and
out
could
reach
her
my
trunk
was
at
last
closed
valise
fastened
and
my
little
bag
crammed
full
i
was
quite
ready
to
start
but
the
fingers
of
the
clock
had
moved
along
by
this
time
and
to
my
horror
i
discovered
that
it
was
eight
marguerite
would
be
coming
down
from
her
bedroom
at
the
top
of
the
house
to
prepare
my
coffee
my
chocolate
and
bread
and
milk
for
my
sisters
in
a
fit
of
despair
and
wild
determination
i
kissed
madame
guérard
with
such
violence
as
almost
to
stifle
her
and
rushed
once
more
to
my
room
to
get
my
little
virgin
mary
which
went
with
me
everywhere
i
threw
a
hundred
kisses
to
my
room
and
then
with
wet
eyes
and
a
joyful
heart
went
downstairs
petit
had
asked
the
man
who
polished
the
floors
to
take
the
trunk
and
the
valise
down
and
caroline
had
fetched
a
cab
i
went
like
a
whirlwind
past
the
door
she
had
her
back
turned
towards
me
and
was
sweeping
the
floor
i
sprang
into
the
cab
and
the
driver
whipped
up
his
horse
i
was
on
my
way
to
spain
i
had
written
an
affectionate
letter
to
my
mother
begging
her
to
forgive
me
and
not
to
be
grieved
i
had
written
a
stupid
letter
of
explanation
to
montigny
the
manager
of
the
gymnase
theatre
the
letter
did
not
explain
anything
though
it
was
written
by
a
child
whose
brain
was
certainly
a
little
affected
and
i
finished
up
with
these
words
pity
on
a
poor
crazy
girl
sardou
told
me
later
on
that
he
happened
to
be
in
office
when
he
received
my
letter
conversation
was
very
animated
and
when
the
door
opened
montigny
exclaimed
in
a
fury
had
given
orders
that
i
was
not
to
be
disturbed
he
was
somewhat
appeased
however
on
seeing
old
troubled
look
and
he
knew
something
urgent
was
the
matter
happened
now
he
asked
taking
the
letter
that
the
old
stage
manager
held
out
to
him
on
recognising
my
paper
with
its
grey
border
he
said
from
that
mad
child
is
she
ill
said
monval
has
gone
to
can
go
to
the
deuce
exclaimed
montigny
for
madame
dieudonnée
to
take
her
part
she
has
a
good
memory
and
half
the
must
be
cut
that
will
settle
trouble
for
i
asked
montigny
nothing
he
answered
that
little
sarah
bernhardt
who
has
cleared
off
to
spain
girl
from
the
français
who
boxed
ears
rather
but
not
for
her
managers
remarked
montigny
continuing
immediately
afterwards
the
conversation
which
had
been
this
is
exactly
as
victorien
sardou
related
the
incident
on
arriving
at
marseilles
caroline
went
to
get
information
about
the
journey
the
result
was
that
we
embarked
on
an
abominable
a
dirty
coaster
smelling
of
oil
and
stale
fish
a
perfect
horror
i
had
never
been
on
the
sea
so
i
fancied
that
all
boats
were
like
this
one
and
that
it
was
no
good
complaining
after
six
days
of
rough
sea
we
landed
at
alicante
oh
that
landing
how
well
i
remember
it
i
had
to
jump
from
boat
to
boat
from
plank
to
plank
with
the
risk
of
falling
into
the
water
a
hundred
times
over
for
i
am
naturally
inclined
to
dizziness
and
the
little
gangways
without
any
rails
rope
or
anything
thrown
across
from
one
boat
to
another
and
bending
under
my
light
weight
seemed
to
me
like
mere
ropes
stretched
across
space
exhausted
with
fatigue
and
hunger
i
went
to
the
first
hotel
recommended
to
us
oh
what
a
hotel
it
was
the
house
itself
was
built
of
stone
with
low
arcades
rooms
on
the
first
floor
were
given
to
me
certainly
the
owners
of
these
hotel
people
had
never
had
two
ladies
in
their
house
before
the
bedroom
was
large
but
with
a
low
ceiling
by
way
of
decoration
there
were
enormous
fish
bones
arranged
in
garlands
caught
up
by
the
heads
of
fish
by
half
shutting
eyes
this
decoration
might
be
taken
for
delicate
sculpture
of
ancient
times
in
reality
however
it
was
merely
composed
of
i
had
a
bed
put
up
for
caroline
in
this
room
we
pulled
the
furniture
across
against
the
doors
and
i
did
not
undress
for
i
could
not
venture
on
those
sheets
i
was
accustomed
to
fine
sheets
perfumed
with
iris
for
my
pretty
little
mother
like
all
dutch
women
had
a
mania
for
linen
and
cleanliness
and
she
had
inculcated
me
with
this
harmless
mania
it
was
about
five
in
the
morning
when
i
opened
my
eyes
no
doubt
instinctively
as
there
had
been
no
sound
to
rouse
me
a
door
leading
i
did
not
know
where
opened
and
a
man
looked
in
i
gave
a
shrill
cry
seized
my
little
virgin
mary
and
waved
her
about
wild
with
terror
caroline
roused
up
with
a
start
and
courageously
rushed
to
the
window
she
threw
it
up
screaming
thieves
help
the
man
disappeared
and
the
house
was
soon
invaded
by
the
police
i
leave
it
to
be
imagined
what
the
police
of
alicante
forty
years
ago
were
like
i
answered
all
the
questions
asked
me
by
a
who
was
an
hungarian
and
spoke
french
i
had
seen
the
man
and
he
had
a
silk
handkerchief
on
his
head
he
had
a
beard
and
on
his
shoulder
a
but
that
was
all
i
knew
the
hungarian
who
i
believe
represented
france
austria
and
hungary
asked
me
the
colour
of
the
beard
silk
handkerchief
and
it
had
been
too
dark
for
me
to
distinguish
the
colours
exactly
the
worthy
man
was
very
much
annoyed
at
my
answer
after
taking
down
a
few
notes
he
remained
thoughtful
for
a
moment
and
then
gave
orders
for
a
message
to
be
taken
to
his
home
it
was
to
ask
his
wife
to
send
a
carriage
and
to
get
a
room
ready
in
order
to
receive
a
young
foreigner
in
distress
i
prepared
to
go
with
him
and
after
paying
my
bill
at
the
hotel
we
started
off
in
the
worthy
carriage
and
i
was
welcomed
by
his
wife
with
the
most
touching
cordiality
i
drank
the
coffee
with
thick
cream
which
she
poured
out
for
me
and
during
breakfast
told
her
who
i
was
and
where
i
was
going
she
then
told
me
in
return
that
her
father
was
an
important
manufacturer
of
cloth
that
he
was
from
bohemia
and
a
great
friend
of
my
she
took
me
to
the
room
that
had
been
prepared
for
me
made
me
go
to
bed
and
told
me
that
while
i
was
asleep
she
would
write
me
some
letters
of
introduction
for
madrid
i
slept
for
ten
hours
without
waking
and
when
i
roused
up
was
thoroughly
rested
in
mind
and
body
i
wanted
to
send
a
telegram
to
my
mother
but
this
was
impossible
as
there
was
no
telegraph
at
alicante
i
wrote
a
letter
therefore
to
my
poor
dear
mother
telling
her
that
i
was
in
the
house
of
friends
of
my
father
etc
etc
the
following
day
i
started
for
madrid
with
a
letter
for
the
landlord
of
the
hôtel
de
la
puerta
del
sol
nice
rooms
were
given
to
us
and
i
sent
messengers
with
the
letters
from
madame
rudcowitz
i
spent
a
fortnight
in
madrid
and
was
made
a
great
deal
of
and
generally
feted
i
went
to
all
the
and
was
infatuated
with
them
i
had
the
honour
of
being
invited
to
a
great
given
in
honour
of
victor
emmanuel
who
was
just
then
the
guest
of
the
queen
of
spain
i
forgot
paris
my
sorrows
disappointments
ambitions
and
everything
else
and
i
wanted
to
live
in
spain
a
telegram
sent
by
madame
guérard
made
me
change
all
my
plans
my
mother
was
very
ill
the
telegram
informed
me
i
packed
my
trunk
and
wanted
to
start
off
at
once
but
when
my
hotel
bill
was
paid
i
had
not
a
to
pay
for
the
railway
journey
the
landlord
of
the
hotel
took
two
tickets
for
me
prepared
a
basket
of
provisions
and
gave
me
two
hundred
francs
at
the
station
telling
me
that
he
had
received
orders
from
madame
rudcowitz
not
to
let
me
want
for
anything
she
and
her
husband
were
certainly
most
delightful
people
my
heart
beat
fast
when
i
reached
my
house
in
paris
petit
was
waiting
for
me
downstairs
in
the
room
she
was
very
excited
to
see
me
looking
so
well
and
kissed
me
with
her
eyes
full
of
tears
of
joy
the
concierge
and
family
poured
forth
their
compliments
madame
guérard
went
upstairs
before
me
to
inform
my
mother
of
my
arrival
and
i
waited
a
moment
in
the
kitchen
and
was
hugged
by
our
old
servant
marguerite
my
sisters
both
came
running
in
jeanne
kissed
me
then
turned
me
round
and
examined
me
régina
with
her
hands
behind
her
back
leaned
against
the
stove
gazing
at
me
furiously
you
kiss
me
régina
i
asked
stooping
down
to
her
like
you
she
answered
went
off
without
me
like
you
she
turned
away
brusquely
to
avoid
my
kiss
and
knocked
her
head
against
the
stove
finally
madame
guérard
appeared
again
and
i
went
with
her
oh
how
repentant
i
was
and
how
deeply
affected
i
knocked
gently
at
the
door
of
the
room
which
was
hung
with
pale
blue
my
mother
looked
very
white
lying
in
her
bed
her
face
was
thinner
but
wonderfully
beautiful
she
stretched
out
her
arms
like
two
wings
and
i
rushed
forward
to
this
white
loving
nest
my
mother
cried
silently
as
she
always
did
then
her
hands
played
with
my
hair
which
she
let
down
and
combed
with
her
long
taper
fingers
then
we
asked
each
other
a
hundred
questions
i
wanted
to
know
everything
and
she
did
too
so
that
we
had
the
most
amusing
duet
of
words
phrases
and
kisses
i
found
that
my
mother
had
had
a
rather
severe
attack
of
pleurisy
that
she
was
now
getting
better
but
was
not
yet
well
i
therefore
took
up
my
abode
again
with
her
and
for
the
time
being
went
back
to
my
old
madame
guérard
had
told
me
in
a
letter
that
my
grandmother
on
my
side
had
at
last
agreed
to
the
proposal
made
by
my
mother
my
father
had
left
a
certain
sum
of
money
which
i
was
to
have
on
my
my
mother
at
my
request
had
asked
my
grandmother
to
let
me
have
half
this
sum
and
she
had
at
last
consented
saying
that
she
should
use
the
interest
of
the
other
half
but
that
this
latter
half
would
always
be
at
my
disposal
if
i
changed
my
mind
and
consented
to
marry
i
was
therefore
determined
to
live
my
life
as
i
wished
to
go
away
from
home
and
be
quite
independent
i
adored
my
mother
but
our
ideas
were
altogether
different
besides
my
godfather
was
perfectly
odious
to
me
and
for
years
and
years
he
had
been
in
the
habit
of
lunching
and
dining
with
us
every
day
and
of
playing
whist
every
evening
he
was
always
hurting
my
feelings
in
one
way
or
another
he
was
a
very
rich
old
bachelor
with
no
near
relatives
he
adored
my
mother
but
she
had
always
refused
to
marry
him
she
had
put
up
with
him
at
first
because
he
was
a
friend
of
my
after
my
death
she
had
continued
to
put
up
with
him
because
she
was
then
accustomed
to
him
until
finally
she
quite
missed
him
when
he
was
ill
or
travelling
but
placid
as
she
was
my
mother
was
authoritative
and
could
not
endure
any
kind
of
constraint
she
therefore
rebelled
against
the
idea
of
another
master
she
was
very
gentle
but
determined
and
this
determination
of
hers
ended
sometimes
in
the
most
violent
anger
she
used
then
to
turn
very
pale
and
violet
rings
would
come
round
her
eyes
her
lips
would
tremble
her
teeth
chatter
her
beautiful
eyes
take
a
fixed
gaze
the
words
would
come
at
intervals
from
her
throat
all
chopped
up
hissing
and
hoarse
after
this
she
would
faint
and
the
veins
of
her
throat
would
swell
and
her
hands
and
feet
turned
icy
cold
sometimes
she
would
be
unconscious
for
hours
and
the
doctors
told
us
that
she
might
die
in
one
of
these
attacks
so
that
we
did
all
in
our
power
to
avoid
these
terrible
accidents
my
mother
knew
this
and
rather
took
advantage
of
it
and
as
i
had
inherited
this
tendency
to
fits
of
rage
from
her
i
could
not
and
did
not
wish
to
live
with
her
as
for
me
i
am
not
placid
i
am
active
and
always
ready
for
fight
and
what
i
want
i
always
want
immediately
i
have
not
the
gentle
obstinacy
peculiar
to
my
mother
the
blood
begins
to
boil
under
my
temples
before
i
have
time
to
control
it
time
has
made
me
wiser
in
this
respect
but
not
sufficiently
so
i
am
aware
of
this
and
it
causes
me
to
suffer
i
did
not
say
anything
about
my
plans
to
our
dear
invalid
but
i
asked
our
old
friend
meydieu
to
find
me
a
flat
the
old
man
who
had
tormented
me
so
much
during
my
childhood
had
been
most
kind
to
me
ever
since
my
at
the
théâtre
français
and
in
spite
of
my
row
with
nathalie
and
my
escapade
when
at
the
gymnase
he
was
now
ready
to
see
the
best
in
me
when
he
came
to
see
us
the
day
after
my
return
home
i
remained
talking
with
him
for
a
time
in
the
and
confided
my
intentions
to
him
he
quite
approved
and
said
that
my
intercourse
with
my
mother
would
be
all
the
more
agreeable
because
of
this
separation
xiii
from
the
porte
martin
theatre
to
the
odéon
i
took
a
flat
in
the
rue
duphot
quite
near
to
my
mother
and
madame
guérard
undertook
to
have
it
furnished
for
me
as
soon
as
my
mother
was
well
again
i
talked
to
her
about
it
and
i
was
not
long
in
making
her
agree
with
me
that
it
was
really
better
i
should
live
by
myself
and
in
my
own
way
when
once
she
had
accepted
the
situation
everything
went
along
satisfactorily
my
sisters
were
present
when
we
were
talking
about
it
jeanne
was
close
to
my
mother
and
regina
who
had
refused
to
speak
to
me
or
look
at
me
ever
since
my
return
three
weeks
ago
suddenly
jumped
on
to
my
lap
me
with
you
this
time
she
exclaimed
suddenly
will
kiss
you
if
you
i
glanced
at
my
mother
rather
embarrassed
take
her
she
said
she
is
régina
jumped
down
again
and
began
to
dance
a
jig
muttering
the
rudest
silliest
things
at
the
same
time
she
then
nearly
stifled
me
with
kisses
sprang
on
to
my
and
kissed
her
hair
her
eyes
her
cheeks
saying
are
glad
i
am
going
you
you
can
give
everything
to
your
jenny
my
mother
coloured
slightly
but
as
her
eyes
fell
on
jeanne
her
expression
changed
and
a
look
of
unspeakable
affection
came
over
her
face
she
pushed
régina
gently
aside
and
the
child
went
on
with
her
jig
two
will
stay
together
said
my
mother
leaning
her
head
back
on
shoulder
and
she
said
this
quite
unconsciously
just
in
the
same
way
as
she
had
gazed
at
my
sister
i
was
perfectly
stupefied
and
closed
my
eyes
so
that
i
should
not
see
i
could
only
hear
my
little
sister
dancing
her
jig
and
emphasising
every
stamp
on
the
floor
with
the
words
we
two
as
well
we
two
we
two
it
was
a
very
painful
little
drama
that
was
stirring
our
four
hearts
in
this
little
home
and
the
result
of
it
was
that
i
settled
down
finally
with
my
little
sister
in
the
flat
in
the
rue
duphot
i
kept
caroline
with
me
and
engaged
a
cook
petit
was
with
me
nearly
all
day
and
i
dined
every
evening
with
my
mother
i
was
still
on
good
terms
with
an
actor
of
the
porte
saint
martin
theatre
who
had
been
appointed
stage
manager
there
marc
fournier
being
at
that
time
manager
of
the
theatre
a
piece
entitled
biche
au
was
then
being
given
it
was
a
spectacular
play
and
was
having
a
great
success
a
delightful
actress
from
the
odéon
theatre
mlle
debay
had
been
engaged
for
the
principal
she
played
tragedy
princesses
most
charmingly
i
often
had
tickets
for
the
porte
saint
martin
and
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
biche
au
madame
ulgade
sang
admirably
in
her
of
the
young
prince
and
amazed
me
mariquita
charmed
me
with
her
dancing
she
was
delightful
and
so
animated
in
her
dances
so
characteristic
and
always
so
full
of
distinction
thanks
to
old
josse
i
knew
every
one
but
to
my
surprise
and
terror
one
evening
towards
five
on
arriving
at
the
theatre
to
get
the
tickets
for
our
seats
he
exclaimed
on
seeing
me
here
is
our
princess
our
little
au
here
she
is
it
is
the
providence
that
watches
over
theatres
who
has
sent
i
struggled
like
an
eel
caught
in
a
net
but
it
was
all
in
vain
marc
fournier
who
could
be
very
charming
gave
me
to
understand
that
i
should
be
rendering
him
a
great
service
and
would
the
receipts
josse
who
guessed
what
my
scruples
were
exclaimed
my
dear
child
it
will
still
be
your
high
art
for
mademoiselle
debay
from
the
odéon
theatre
plays
this
of
princess
and
mademoiselle
debay
is
the
first
artiste
at
the
odéon
and
the
odéon
is
an
imperial
theatre
so
that
it
can
not
be
any
disgrace
after
your
mariquita
who
had
just
arrived
also
persuaded
me
and
madame
ulgade
was
sent
for
to
rehearse
the
duos
for
i
was
to
sing
yes
and
i
was
to
sing
with
a
veritable
artiste
one
who
was
considered
to
be
the
first
artiste
of
the
opéra
comique
there
was
but
little
time
to
spare
josse
made
me
rehearse
my
which
i
almost
knew
as
i
had
seen
the
piece
often
and
i
had
an
extraordinary
memory
the
minutes
flew
soon
running
into
quarters
of
an
hour
and
these
quarters
of
an
hour
made
and
then
entire
hours
i
kept
looking
at
the
clock
the
large
clock
in
the
room
where
madame
ulgade
was
making
me
rehearse
she
thought
my
voice
was
pretty
but
i
kept
singing
out
of
tune
and
she
helped
me
along
and
encouraged
me
all
the
time
i
was
dressed
up
in
mlle
clothes
and
the
curtain
was
raised
poor
me
i
was
more
dead
than
alive
but
my
courage
returned
after
a
triple
burst
of
applause
for
the
couplet
which
i
sang
on
waking
in
very
much
the
same
way
as
i
should
have
murmured
a
series
of
lines
when
the
performance
was
over
marc
fournier
offered
me
through
josse
a
three
engagement
but
i
asked
to
be
allowed
to
think
it
over
josse
had
introduced
me
to
a
dramatic
author
lambert
thiboust
a
charming
man
who
was
certainly
not
without
talent
he
thought
i
was
just
the
ideal
actress
for
his
heroine
in
bergère
but
faille
an
old
actor
who
had
just
become
manager
of
the
ambigu
theatre
was
not
the
only
person
to
consult
for
a
certain
de
chilly
had
some
interest
in
the
theatre
de
chilly
had
made
his
name
in
the
of
rodin
in
juif
and
after
marrying
a
rather
wealthy
wife
had
left
the
stage
and
was
now
interested
in
the
business
side
of
theatrical
affairs
he
had
i
think
just
given
the
ambigu
up
to
faille
de
chilly
was
then
helping
on
a
charming
girl
named
laurence
gérard
she
was
gentle
and
very
rather
pretty
but
without
any
real
beauty
or
grace
faille
told
lambert
thiboust
that
he
was
negotiating
with
laurence
gérard
but
that
he
was
ready
to
do
as
the
author
wished
in
the
matter
the
only
thing
he
stipulated
was
that
he
should
hear
me
before
deciding
i
was
willing
to
humour
the
poor
fellow
who
must
have
been
as
poor
a
manager
as
he
had
been
an
artiste
i
gave
a
short
performance
for
him
at
the
ambigu
theatre
the
stage
was
only
lighted
by
the
wretched
a
little
transportable
lamp
about
a
yard
in
front
of
me
i
could
see
faille
balancing
himself
on
his
chair
one
hand
on
his
waistcoat
and
the
fingers
of
the
other
hand
in
his
enormous
nostrils
this
disgusted
me
horribly
lambert
thiboust
was
seated
near
him
his
handsome
face
smiling
as
he
looked
at
me
encouragingly
i
had
selected
ne
badine
pas
avec
i
did
not
want
to
recite
verse
because
i
was
to
perform
in
a
play
in
prose
i
believe
i
was
perfectly
charming
and
lambert
thiboust
thought
so
too
but
when
i
had
finished
poor
faille
got
up
in
a
clumsy
pretentious
way
said
something
in
a
low
voice
to
the
author
and
took
me
to
his
office
remarked
the
worthy
but
stupid
manager
are
no
good
on
the
stage
i
resented
this
but
he
continued
no
no
good
and
as
the
door
then
opened
he
added
pointing
to
the
is
de
chilly
who
was
also
listening
to
you
and
he
will
say
just
the
same
as
i
de
chilly
nodded
and
shrugged
his
shoulders
thiboust
is
mad
he
remarked
one
ever
saw
such
a
thin
shepherdess
he
then
rang
the
bell
and
told
the
boy
to
show
in
mlle
laurence
gérard
i
understood
and
without
taking
leave
of
the
two
boors
i
left
the
room
my
heart
was
heavy
though
as
i
went
back
to
the
where
i
had
left
my
hat
there
i
found
laurence
gérard
but
she
was
fetched
away
the
next
moment
i
was
standing
near
her
and
as
i
looked
in
the
glass
i
was
struck
by
the
contrast
between
us
she
was
plump
with
a
wide
face
and
magnificent
black
eyes
her
nose
was
rather
her
mouth
heavy
and
there
was
a
very
ordinary
look
about
her
generally
i
was
fair
slight
and
like
a
reed
with
a
long
pale
face
blue
eyes
a
rather
sad
mouth
and
a
general
look
of
distinction
this
hasty
vision
consoled
me
for
my
failure
and
then
too
i
felt
that
this
faille
was
a
nonentity
and
that
de
chilly
was
common
i
was
destined
to
meet
with
them
both
again
later
in
my
life
chilly
soon
after
as
manager
at
the
odéon
and
faille
twenty
years
later
in
such
a
wretched
condition
that
the
tears
came
to
my
eyes
when
he
appeared
before
me
and
begged
me
to
play
for
his
benefit
i
beseech
you
said
the
poor
man
will
be
the
only
attraction
at
this
performance
and
i
have
only
you
to
count
on
for
the
i
shook
hands
with
him
i
do
not
know
whether
he
remembered
our
first
interview
and
my
but
i
who
remembered
it
well
only
hope
that
he
did
not
five
days
later
mile
debay
was
well
again
and
took
her
as
usual
before
accepting
an
engagement
at
the
porte
saint
martin
i
wrote
to
camille
doucet
the
following
day
i
received
a
letter
asking
me
to
call
at
the
ministry
it
was
not
without
some
emotion
that
i
went
to
see
this
kind
man
again
he
was
standing
up
waiting
for
me
when
i
was
ushered
into
the
room
he
held
out
his
hands
to
me
and
drew
me
gently
towards
him
what
a
terrible
child
he
said
giving
me
a
chair
now
you
must
be
calmer
it
will
never
do
to
waste
all
these
admirable
gifts
in
voyages
escapades
and
boxing
i
was
deeply
moved
by
his
kindness
and
my
eyes
were
full
of
regret
as
i
looked
at
him
cry
my
dear
child
cry
let
us
try
and
find
out
how
we
are
to
make
up
for
all
this
he
was
silent
for
a
moment
and
then
opening
a
drawer
he
took
out
a
letter
is
something
which
will
perhaps
save
us
he
said
it
was
a
letter
from
duquesnel
who
had
just
been
appointed
manager
of
the
odéon
theatre
in
conjunction
with
chilly
ask
me
for
some
young
artistes
to
make
up
the
odéon
company
well
we
must
attend
to
he
got
up
and
accompanying
me
to
the
door
said
as
i
went
away
shall
i
went
back
home
and
began
at
once
to
rehearse
all
my
in
plays
i
waited
very
anxiously
for
several
days
consoled
by
madame
guérard
who
succeeded
in
restoring
my
confidence
finally
i
received
a
letter
and
went
at
once
to
the
ministry
camille
doucet
received
me
with
a
beaming
expression
on
his
face
settled
he
said
but
it
has
not
been
easy
though
he
added
are
very
young
but
very
celebrated
already
for
your
headstrong
character
but
i
have
pledged
my
word
that
you
will
be
as
gentle
as
a
young
i
will
be
gentle
i
promise
i
replied
only
out
of
gratitude
but
what
am
i
to
do
is
a
letter
for
félix
duquesnel
he
replied
is
expecting
i
thanked
camille
doucet
heartily
and
he
then
said
shall
see
you
again
less
officially
at
your
on
thursday
i
have
received
an
invitation
this
morning
to
dine
there
so
you
will
be
able
to
tell
me
what
duquesnel
it
was
then
ten
in
the
morning
i
went
home
to
put
some
pretty
clothes
on
i
chose
a
dress
the
underskirt
of
which
was
of
canary
yellow
the
dress
being
of
black
silk
with
the
skirt
scalloped
round
and
a
straw
hat
trimmed
with
corn
and
black
ribbon
velvet
under
the
chin
it
must
have
been
delightfully
mad
looking
arrayed
in
this
style
feeling
very
joyful
and
full
of
confidence
i
went
to
call
on
félix
duquesnel
i
waited
a
few
moments
in
a
little
room
very
artistically
furnished
a
young
man
appeared
looking
very
elegant
he
was
smiling
and
altogether
charming
i
could
not
grasp
the
fact
that
this
gay
young
man
would
be
my
manager
after
a
short
conversation
we
agreed
on
every
point
we
touched
to
the
odéon
at
two
said
duquesnel
by
way
of
i
will
introduce
you
to
my
partner
i
ought
to
say
it
the
other
way
round
according
to
society
etiquette
he
added
laughing
we
are
talking
shop
he
came
a
few
steps
down
the
staircase
with
me
and
stayed
there
leaning
over
the
balustrade
to
wish
me
at
two
precisely
i
was
at
the
odéon
and
had
to
wait
an
hour
i
began
to
grind
my
teeth
and
only
the
remembrance
of
my
promise
to
camille
doucet
prevented
me
from
going
away
finally
duquesnel
appeared
and
took
me
across
to
the
office
will
now
see
the
other
ogre
he
said
and
i
pictured
to
myself
the
other
ogre
as
charming
as
his
partner
i
was
therefore
greatly
disappointed
on
seeing
a
very
ugly
little
man
whom
i
recognised
as
chilly
he
eyed
me
up
and
down
most
impolitely
and
pretended
not
to
recognise
me
he
signed
to
me
to
sit
down
and
without
a
word
handed
me
a
pen
and
showed
me
where
to
sign
my
name
on
the
paper
before
me
madame
guérard
interposed
laying
her
hand
on
mine
not
sign
without
reading
it
she
said
you
mother
he
asked
looking
up
she
said
it
is
just
as
though
i
yes
you
are
right
read
it
quickly
he
continued
then
sign
or
leave
it
alone
but
be
i
felt
the
colour
coming
into
my
face
for
this
man
was
odious
duquesnel
whispered
to
me
no
ceremony
about
him
but
a
good
fellow
take
i
signed
my
contract
and
handed
it
to
his
ugly
partner
know
he
remarked
is
responsible
for
you
i
should
not
upon
any
account
have
engaged
if
you
had
been
alone
monsieur
i
answered
should
not
have
signed
so
we
are
i
went
away
at
once
and
hurried
to
my
to
tell
her
for
i
knew
this
would
be
a
great
joy
for
her
then
that
very
day
i
set
off
with
petit
to
buy
everything
necessary
for
furnishing
my
the
following
day
i
went
to
the
convent
in
the
rue
notre
to
see
my
dear
governess
mlle
de
brabender
she
had
been
ill
with
acute
rheumatism
in
all
her
limbs
for
the
last
thirteen
months
she
had
suffered
so
much
that
she
looked
like
a
different
person
she
was
lying
in
her
little
white
bed
a
little
white
cap
covering
her
hair
her
big
nose
was
drawn
with
pain
her
eyes
seemed
to
have
no
colour
in
them
her
formidable
moustache
alone
bristled
up
with
constant
spasms
of
pain
besides
all
this
she
was
so
strangely
altered
that
i
wondered
what
had
caused
the
change
i
went
nearer
and
bending
down
kissed
her
gently
i
then
gazed
at
her
so
inquisitively
that
she
understood
instinctively
with
her
eyes
she
signed
to
me
to
look
on
the
table
near
her
and
there
in
a
glass
i
saw
all
my
dear
old
teeth
i
put
the
three
roses
i
had
brought
her
in
the
glass
and
kissing
her
again
i
asked
her
forgiveness
for
my
impertinent
curiosity
i
left
the
convent
with
a
very
heavy
heart
for
the
mother
superior
told
me
in
the
garden
that
my
beloved
mlle
de
brabender
could
not
live
much
longer
i
therefore
went
every
day
for
a
time
to
see
my
gentle
old
governess
but
as
soon
as
the
rehearsals
commenced
at
the
odéon
my
visits
had
to
be
less
frequent
one
morning
about
seven
a
message
came
from
the
convent
to
fetch
me
in
great
haste
and
i
was
present
at
the
dear
her
face
lighted
up
at
the
supreme
moment
with
such
a
holy
look
that
i
suddenly
longed
to
die
i
kissed
her
hands
which
were
holding
the
crucifix
and
they
had
already
turned
cold
i
asked
to
be
allowed
to
be
there
when
she
was
placed
in
her
coffin
on
arriving
at
the
convent
the
next
day
at
the
hour
fixed
i
found
the
sisters
in
such
a
state
of
consternation
that
i
was
alarmed
what
could
have
happened
i
wondered
they
pointed
to
the
door
of
the
cell
without
uttering
a
word
the
nuns
were
standing
round
the
bed
on
which
was
the
most
extraordinary
looking
being
imaginable
my
poor
governess
lying
rigid
on
her
deathbed
had
a
face
her
moustache
had
grown
longer
and
she
had
a
beard
nearly
half
an
inch
long
her
moustache
and
beard
were
sandy
whilst
the
long
hair
framing
her
face
was
white
her
mouth
without
the
support
of
the
teeth
had
sunk
in
so
that
her
nose
fell
on
the
sandy
moustache
it
was
like
a
terrible
and
mask
instead
of
the
sweet
face
of
my
friend
it
was
the
mask
of
a
man
whilst
the
little
delicate
hands
were
those
of
a
woman
there
was
an
expression
in
the
eyes
of
the
nuns
in
spite
of
the
assurance
of
the
nurse
who
had
dressed
the
poor
dead
body
and
had
declared
to
them
that
the
body
was
that
of
a
woman
but
the
poor
little
sisters
were
trembling
and
crossing
themselves
all
the
time
the
day
after
this
dismal
ceremony
i
made
my
at
the
odéon
in
jeu
de
et
du
i
was
not
suited
for
plays
as
they
require
a
certain
coquettishness
and
an
affectation
which
were
not
then
and
still
are
not
among
my
qualities
then
too
i
was
rather
too
slight
so
that
i
made
no
success
at
all
chilly
happened
to
be
passing
along
the
corridor
just
as
duquesnel
was
talking
to
me
and
encouraging
me
chilly
pointed
to
me
and
remarked
flûte
pour
les
gens
du
monde
il
a
même
pas
de
i
was
furious
at
the
insolence
and
the
blood
rushed
to
my
face
but
i
saw
through
my
eyes
camille
face
that
face
always
so
clean
shaven
and
under
his
crown
of
white
hair
i
thought
it
was
a
vision
of
my
mind
which
was
always
on
the
alert
on
account
of
the
promise
i
had
made
but
no
it
was
he
himself
and
he
came
up
to
me
a
pretty
voice
you
have
he
said
second
appearance
will
be
such
a
pleasure
for
us
this
man
was
always
courteous
but
truthful
this
of
mine
had
not
given
him
any
pleasure
but
he
was
counting
on
my
next
appearance
and
he
had
spoken
the
truth
i
had
a
pretty
voice
and
that
was
all
that
any
one
could
say
from
my
first
trial
i
remained
at
the
odéon
and
worked
very
hard
i
was
ready
to
take
any
place
at
a
notice
for
i
knew
all
the
i
made
some
success
and
the
students
had
a
predilection
for
me
when
i
came
on
to
the
stage
i
was
always
greeted
by
applause
from
these
young
men
a
few
old
sticklers
used
to
turn
towards
the
pit
and
try
and
command
silence
but
no
one
cared
a
straw
for
them
finally
my
day
of
triumph
dawned
duquesnel
had
the
happy
idea
of
putting
on
again
with
choruses
beauvallet
who
had
been
odious
as
a
professor
was
charming
as
a
comrade
by
special
permission
from
the
ministry
he
was
to
play
joad
the
of
zacharie
was
assigned
to
me
some
of
the
conservatoire
pupils
were
to
take
the
spoken
choruses
and
the
female
pupils
who
studied
singing
undertook
the
musical
part
the
rehearsals
were
so
bad
that
duquesnel
and
chilly
were
in
despair
beauvallet
who
was
more
agreeable
now
but
not
choice
in
his
language
muttered
some
terrible
words
we
began
over
and
over
again
but
it
was
all
to
no
purpose
the
spoken
choruses
were
simply
abominable
when
suddenly
chilly
exclaimed
let
the
young
one
say
all
the
spoken
choruses
they
will
be
right
enough
with
her
pretty
voice
duquesnel
did
not
utter
a
word
but
he
pulled
his
moustache
to
hide
a
smile
chilly
was
coming
round
to
his
after
all
he
nodded
his
head
in
an
indifferent
way
in
answer
to
his
questioning
look
and
we
began
again
i
reading
all
the
spoken
choruses
every
one
applauded
and
the
conductor
of
the
orchestra
was
delighted
for
the
poor
man
had
suffered
enough
the
first
performance
was
a
veritable
little
triumph
for
me
oh
quite
a
little
one
but
still
full
of
promise
for
my
future
the
audience
charmed
with
the
sweetness
of
my
voice
and
its
crystal
purity
encored
the
part
of
the
spoken
choruses
and
i
was
rewarded
by
three
rounds
of
applause
at
the
end
of
the
act
chilly
came
to
me
and
said
art
adorable
his
rather
annoyed
me
but
i
answered
mischievously
using
the
same
form
of
speech
findest
me
fatter
he
burst
into
a
fit
of
laughter
and
from
that
day
forth
we
both
used
the
familiar
and
became
the
best
friends
imaginable
oh
that
odéon
theatre
it
is
the
theatre
i
loved
most
i
was
very
sorry
to
leave
it
for
every
one
liked
each
other
there
and
every
one
was
gay
the
theatre
is
a
little
like
the
continuation
of
school
the
young
artistes
came
there
and
duquesnel
was
an
intelligent
manager
and
very
polite
and
young
himself
during
rehearsal
we
often
went
off
several
of
us
together
to
play
ball
in
the
luxembourg
during
the
acts
in
which
we
were
not
i
used
to
think
of
my
few
months
at
the
comédie
française
the
little
world
i
had
known
there
had
been
stiff
and
jealous
i
recalled
my
few
months
at
the
gymnase
hats
and
dresses
were
always
discussed
there
and
every
one
chattered
about
a
hundred
things
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
art
at
the
odéon
i
was
happy
we
thought
of
nothing
but
putting
plays
on
and
we
rehearsed
morning
afternoon
and
at
all
hours
and
i
liked
that
very
much
for
the
summer
i
had
taken
a
little
house
in
the
villa
montmorency
at
auteuil
i
went
to
the
theatre
in
a
which
i
drove
myself
i
had
two
wonderful
ponies
that
aunt
rosine
had
given
to
me
because
they
had
very
nearly
broken
her
neck
by
taking
fright
at
st
cloud
at
a
whirligig
of
wooden
horses
i
used
to
drive
at
full
speed
along
the
quays
and
in
spite
of
the
atmosphere
brilliant
with
the
july
sunshine
and
the
gaiety
of
everything
outside
i
always
ran
up
the
cold
cracked
steps
of
the
theatre
with
veritable
joy
and
rushed
up
to
my
wishing
every
one
i
passed
good
morning
on
my
way
when
i
had
taken
off
my
coat
and
gloves
i
went
on
to
the
stage
delighted
to
be
once
more
in
that
infinite
darkness
with
only
a
poor
light
a
hanging
here
and
there
on
a
tree
a
turret
a
wall
or
placed
on
a
bench
thrown
on
the
faces
of
the
artistes
for
a
few
seconds
there
was
nothing
more
vivifying
for
me
than
that
atmosphere
full
of
microbes
nothing
more
gay
than
that
obscurity
and
nothing
more
brilliant
than
that
darkness
one
day
my
mother
had
the
curiosity
to
come
behind
the
scenes
i
thought
she
would
have
died
with
horror
and
disgust
you
poor
child
she
murmured
can
you
live
in
that
when
once
she
was
outside
again
she
began
to
breathe
freely
taking
long
gasps
several
times
oh
yes
i
could
live
in
it
and
i
really
only
lived
well
in
it
since
then
i
have
changed
a
little
but
i
still
have
a
great
liking
for
that
gloomy
workshop
in
which
we
joyous
lapidaries
of
art
cut
the
precious
stones
supplied
to
us
by
the
poets
the
days
passed
by
carrying
away
with
them
all
our
little
disappointed
hopes
and
fresh
days
dawned
bringing
fresh
dreams
so
that
life
seemed
to
me
eternal
happiness
i
played
in
turn
in
marquis
de
and
le
in
the
former
i
took
the
part
of
the
foolish
baroness
an
expert
woman
of
years
of
age
i
was
scarcely
myself
and
i
looked
seventeen
in
the
second
piece
i
played
mariette
and
made
a
great
success
those
rehearsals
of
the
de
and
le
have
remained
in
my
memory
as
so
many
exquisite
hours
madame
george
sand
was
a
sweet
charming
creature
extremely
timid
she
did
not
talk
much
but
smoked
all
the
time
her
large
eyes
were
always
dreamy
and
her
mouth
which
was
rather
heavy
and
common
had
the
kindest
expression
she
had
perhaps
had
a
figure
but
she
was
no
longer
upright
i
used
to
watch
her
with
the
most
romantic
affection
for
had
she
not
been
the
heroine
of
a
fine
love
romance
i
used
to
sit
down
by
her
and
when
i
took
her
hand
in
mine
i
held
it
as
long
as
possible
her
voice
too
was
gentle
and
fascinating
prince
napoleon
commonly
known
as
often
used
to
come
to
george
rehearsals
he
was
extremely
fond
of
her
the
first
time
i
ever
saw
that
man
i
turned
pale
and
felt
as
though
my
heart
had
stopped
beating
he
looked
so
much
like
napoleon
that
i
disliked
him
for
it
by
resembling
him
it
seemed
to
me
that
he
made
him
seem
less
far
away
and
brought
him
nearer
to
every
one
madame
sand
introduced
me
to
him
in
spite
of
my
wishes
he
looked
at
me
in
an
impertinent
way
he
displeased
me
i
scarcely
replied
to
his
compliments
and
went
closer
to
george
sand
she
is
in
love
with
you
he
exclaimed
laughing
george
sand
stroked
my
cheek
gently
is
my
little
madonna
she
answered
not
torment
i
stayed
with
her
casting
displeased
and
furtive
glances
at
the
prince
gradually
though
i
began
to
enjoy
listening
to
him
for
his
conversation
was
brilliant
serious
and
at
the
same
time
witty
he
sprinkled
his
discourses
and
his
replies
with
words
that
were
a
trifle
crude
but
all
that
he
said
was
interesting
and
instructive
he
was
not
very
indulgent
though
and
i
have
heard
him
say
base
horrible
things
about
little
thiers
which
i
believe
had
little
truth
in
them
he
drew
such
an
amusing
portrait
one
day
of
that
agreeable
louis
bouilhet
that
george
sand
who
liked
him
could
not
help
laughing
although
she
called
the
prince
a
bad
man
he
was
very
unceremonious
too
but
at
the
same
time
he
did
not
like
people
to
be
wanting
in
respect
to
him
one
day
an
artiste
named
paul
deshayes
who
was
playing
in
le
came
into
the
prince
napoleon
madame
george
sand
the
curator
of
the
library
whose
name
i
have
forgotten
and
myself
were
there
this
artiste
was
common
and
something
of
an
anarchist
he
bowed
to
madame
sand
and
addressing
the
prince
said
are
sitting
on
my
gloves
the
prince
scarcely
moved
pulled
the
gloves
out
and
throwing
them
on
the
floor
remarked
thought
this
seat
was
the
actor
coloured
picked
up
the
gloves
and
went
away
murmuring
some
revolutionary
threat
i
played
the
part
of
hortense
in
testament
de
by
girodot
and
of
anna
danby
in
alexandre
on
the
evening
of
the
first
performance
of
the
latter
piece
footnote
february
the
audience
was
most
aggravating
dumas
was
quite
out
of
favour
on
account
of
a
private
matter
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
art
politics
for
some
time
past
had
been
exciting
every
one
and
the
return
of
victor
hugo
from
exile
was
very
much
desired
when
dumas
entered
his
box
he
was
greeted
by
yells
the
students
were
there
in
full
force
and
they
began
shouting
for
dumas
rose
and
asked
to
be
allowed
to
speak
young
friends
he
began
as
soon
as
there
was
silence
are
quite
willing
to
listen
called
out
some
one
you
must
be
alone
in
your
dumas
protested
vehemently
several
persons
in
the
orchestra
took
his
side
for
he
had
invited
a
lady
into
his
box
and
whoever
that
lady
might
be
no
one
had
any
right
to
insult
her
in
so
outrageous
a
manner
i
had
never
yet
witnessed
a
scene
of
this
kind
i
looked
through
the
hole
in
the
curtain
and
was
very
much
interested
and
excited
i
saw
our
great
dumas
pale
with
anger
clenching
his
fists
shouting
swearing
and
storming
then
suddenly
there
was
a
burst
of
applause
the
woman
had
disappeared
from
the
box
she
had
taken
advantage
of
the
moment
when
dumas
leaning
well
over
the
front
of
the
box
was
answering
no
this
lady
shall
not
leave
the
box
just
at
this
moment
she
slipped
away
and
the
whole
house
delighted
shouted
dumas
was
then
allowed
to
continue
but
only
for
à
few
seconds
cries
of
blas
ruy
victor
hugo
hugo
could
then
be
heard
again
in
the
midst
of
an
infernal
uproar
we
had
been
ready
to
commence
the
play
for
an
hour
and
i
was
greatly
excited
chilly
and
duquesnel
then
came
to
us
on
the
stage
mes
for
the
house
has
gone
mad
they
said
will
commence
anyhow
let
what
will
afraid
i
shall
faint
i
said
to
duquesnel
my
hands
were
as
cold
as
ice
and
my
heart
was
beating
wildly
am
i
to
do
i
asked
him
i
get
too
frightened
nothing
to
be
done
he
replied
frightened
but
go
on
playing
and
faint
upon
any
account
the
curtain
was
drawn
up
in
the
midst
of
a
veritable
tempest
bird
cries
and
a
heavy
rhythmical
refrain
of
blas
ruy
blas
victor
hugo
victor
hugo
my
turn
came
berton
who
was
playing
kean
had
been
received
badly
i
was
wearing
the
eccentric
costume
of
an
englishwoman
in
the
year
as
soon
as
i
appeared
i
heard
a
burst
of
laughter
and
i
stood
still
rooted
to
the
spot
in
the
doorway
at
the
very
same
instant
the
cheers
of
my
dear
friends
the
students
drowned
the
laughter
of
the
aggravators
this
gave
me
courage
and
i
even
felt
a
desire
to
fight
but
it
was
not
necessary
for
after
the
second
endlessly
long
harangue
in
which
i
give
an
idea
of
my
love
for
kean
the
house
was
delighted
and
gave
me
an
ovation
wrote
the
following
paragraph
in
the
sarah
bernhardt
appeared
wearing
an
eccentric
costume
which
increased
the
tumult
but
her
rich
voice
that
astonishing
voice
of
hers
appealed
to
the
public
and
she
charmed
them
like
a
little
after
i
played
in
loterie
du
when
we
were
rehearsing
the
piece
agar
came
up
to
me
one
day
in
the
corner
where
i
usually
sat
i
had
a
little
there
from
my
and
put
my
feet
up
on
a
straw
chair
i
liked
this
place
because
there
was
a
little
there
and
i
could
work
whilst
waiting
for
my
turn
to
go
on
the
stage
i
loved
embroidery
and
tapestry
work
i
had
a
quantity
of
different
kinds
of
fancy
work
commenced
and
could
take
up
one
or
the
other
as
i
felt
inclined
madame
agar
was
an
admirable
creature
she
had
evidently
been
created
for
the
joy
of
the
eyes
she
was
a
brunette
tall
pale
with
large
dark
gentle
eyes
a
very
small
mouth
with
full
rounded
lips
which
went
up
at
the
corners
with
an
imperceptible
smile
she
had
exquisite
teeth
and
her
head
was
covered
with
thick
glossy
hair
she
was
the
living
incarnation
of
one
of
the
most
beautiful
types
of
ancient
greece
her
pretty
hands
were
long
and
rather
soft
whilst
her
slow
and
rather
heavy
walk
completed
the
illusion
she
was
the
great
of
the
odéon
theatre
she
approached
me
with
her
measured
tread
followed
by
a
young
man
of
from
to
years
of
age
my
dear
she
said
kissing
me
is
a
chance
for
you
to
make
a
poet
happy
she
then
introduced
françois
coppée
i
invited
the
young
man
to
sit
down
and
then
i
looked
at
him
more
thoroughly
his
handsome
face
emaciated
and
pale
was
that
of
the
immortal
bonaparte
a
thrill
of
emotion
went
through
me
for
i
adore
napoleon
i
you
a
poet
monsieur
i
asked
his
voice
too
trembled
for
he
was
still
more
timid
than
i
was
have
written
a
little
piece
he
continued
mlle
agar
is
sure
that
you
will
play
it
with
my
dear
put
in
agar
are
going
to
play
it
for
him
it
is
a
little
masterpiece
and
i
am
sure
you
will
make
a
gigantic
and
you
too
you
will
be
so
beautiful
in
it
said
the
poet
gazing
rapturously
at
agar
i
was
called
on
to
the
stage
just
at
this
moment
and
on
returning
a
few
minutes
later
i
found
the
young
poet
talking
in
a
low
voice
to
the
beautiful
i
coughed
and
agar
who
had
taken
my
wanted
to
give
it
me
back
on
my
refusing
it
she
pulled
me
down
on
to
her
lap
the
young
man
drew
up
his
chair
and
we
chatted
away
together
our
three
heads
almost
touching
it
was
decided
that
after
reading
the
piece
i
should
show
it
to
duquesnel
who
alone
was
capable
of
judging
poetry
and
that
we
should
then
get
permission
from
both
managers
to
play
it
at
a
benefit
that
was
to
take
place
after
our
next
production
the
young
man
was
delighted
and
his
pale
face
lighted
up
with
a
grateful
smile
as
he
shook
hands
excitedly
agar
walked
away
with
him
as
far
as
the
little
landing
which
projected
over
the
stage
i
watched
them
as
they
went
the
magnificent
woman
and
the
slender
outline
of
the
young
writer
agar
was
perhaps
at
that
time
she
was
certainly
very
beautiful
but
to
me
there
was
no
charm
about
her
and
i
could
not
understand
why
this
poetical
bonaparte
was
in
love
with
this
matronly
woman
it
was
as
clear
as
daylight
that
he
was
and
she
too
appeared
to
be
in
love
this
interested
me
infinitely
i
watched
them
clasp
each
hands
and
then
with
an
abrupt
and
almost
awkward
movement
the
young
poet
bent
over
the
beautiful
hand
he
was
holding
and
kissed
it
fervently
agar
came
back
to
me
with
a
faint
colour
in
her
cheeks
this
was
rare
with
her
for
she
had
a
complexion
is
the
manuscript
she
said
giving
me
a
little
roll
of
paper
the
rehearsal
was
over
and
i
wished
agar
and
on
my
way
home
read
the
piece
i
was
so
delighted
with
it
that
i
drove
straight
back
to
the
theatre
to
give
it
to
duquesnel
at
once
i
met
him
coming
downstairs
come
back
again
please
i
exclaimed
heavens
my
dear
girl
what
is
the
matter
he
asked
look
as
though
you
have
won
a
big
lottery
it
is
something
like
that
i
said
and
entering
his
office
i
produced
the
manuscript
this
please
i
continued
take
it
with
me
he
said
no
read
it
here
at
once
i
insisted
i
read
it
to
you
no
he
replied
voice
is
treacherous
it
makes
charming
poetry
of
the
worst
lines
possible
well
let
me
have
it
he
continued
sitting
down
in
his
he
began
to
read
whilst
i
looked
at
the
newspapers
delicious
he
soon
exclaimed
a
perfect
i
sprang
to
my
feet
in
joy
you
will
get
chilly
to
accept
it
yes
you
can
make
your
mind
easy
but
when
do
you
want
to
play
it
the
author
seems
to
be
in
a
great
hurry
i
said
agar
you
as
well
he
put
in
laughing
this
is
a
that
just
suits
your
my
dear
i
acknowledged
too
want
it
put
on
at
once
do
you
want
to
be
very
nice
i
added
so
let
us
have
it
for
the
benefit
of
madame
in
a
fortnight
from
now
that
would
not
make
any
difference
to
other
arrangements
and
our
poet
would
be
so
said
duquesnel
will
settle
it
like
that
what
about
the
scenery
though
he
muttered
meditatively
biting
his
nails
which
were
then
his
favourite
meal
when
disturbed
in
his
mind
i
had
already
thought
that
out
so
i
offered
to
drive
him
home
and
on
the
way
i
put
my
plan
before
him
we
might
have
the
scenery
of
de
a
piece
that
had
been
put
on
and
taken
off
again
immediately
after
being
jeered
at
by
the
public
the
scenery
consisted
of
a
superb
italian
park
with
flowers
statues
and
even
a
flight
of
steps
as
to
costumes
if
we
spoke
of
them
to
chilly
no
matter
how
little
they
might
cost
he
would
shriek
as
he
had
done
in
his
of
rodin
agar
and
i
would
supply
our
own
costumes
when
i
arrived
at
house
he
asked
me
to
go
in
and
discuss
the
costumes
with
his
wife
i
accepted
his
invitation
and
after
kissing
the
prettiest
face
one
could
possibly
dream
of
i
told
its
owner
about
our
plot
she
approved
of
everything
and
promised
to
begin
at
once
to
look
out
for
pretty
designs
for
our
costumes
whilst
she
was
talking
i
compared
her
with
agar
oh
how
much
i
preferred
that
charming
head
with
its
fair
hair
those
large
limpid
eyes
and
the
face
with
its
two
little
pink
dimples
her
hair
was
soft
and
light
and
formed
a
halo
round
her
forehead
i
admired
too
her
delicate
wrists
finishing
with
the
loveliest
hands
imaginable
hands
that
were
later
on
quite
famous
on
leaving
my
two
friends
i
drove
straight
to
to
tell
her
what
had
happened
she
kissed
me
over
and
over
again
and
a
cousin
of
hers
a
priest
who
happened
to
be
there
appeared
to
be
very
delighted
with
my
story
he
seemed
to
know
about
everything
presently
there
was
a
timid
ring
at
the
bell
and
françois
coppée
was
announced
am
just
going
away
i
said
to
him
as
i
met
him
in
the
doorway
and
shook
hands
will
tell
you
xiv
le
passant
at
the
tuileries
fire
in
my
flat
the
rehearsals
of
commenced
very
soon
after
this
and
were
delightful
for
the
timid
young
poet
was
a
most
interesting
and
intelligent
talker
the
first
performance
took
place
as
arranged
and
was
a
veritable
triumph
the
whole
house
cheered
over
and
over
again
and
agar
and
myself
had
eight
curtain
calls
we
tried
in
vain
to
bring
the
author
forward
as
the
audience
wished
to
see
him
françois
coppée
was
not
to
be
found
the
young
poet
hitherto
unknown
had
become
famous
within
a
few
hours
his
name
was
on
all
lips
as
for
agar
and
myself
we
were
simply
overwhelmed
with
praise
and
chilly
wanted
to
pay
for
our
costumes
we
played
this
piece
more
than
a
hundred
times
consecutively
to
full
houses
we
were
asked
to
give
it
at
the
tuileries
and
at
the
house
of
princess
mathilde
oh
that
first
performance
at
the
tuileries
it
is
stamped
on
my
brain
for
ever
and
with
my
eyes
shut
i
can
see
every
detail
again
even
now
it
had
been
arranged
between
duquesnel
and
the
official
sent
from
the
court
that
agar
and
i
should
go
to
the
tuileries
to
see
the
room
where
we
were
to
play
in
order
to
have
it
arranged
according
to
the
requirements
of
the
piece
count
de
laferrière
was
to
introduce
me
to
the
emperor
who
would
then
introduce
me
to
the
empress
eugénie
agar
was
to
be
introduced
by
princess
mathilde
to
whom
she
was
then
sitting
as
minerva
de
laferrière
came
for
me
at
nine
in
a
state
carriage
and
madame
guérard
accompanied
me
de
laferrière
was
a
very
agreeable
man
with
rather
stiff
manners
as
we
were
turning
round
the
rue
royale
the
carriage
had
to
draw
up
an
instant
and
general
fleury
approached
us
i
knew
him
as
he
had
been
introduced
to
me
by
morny
he
spoke
to
us
and
comte
de
laferrière
explained
where
we
were
going
as
he
left
us
he
said
to
me
luck
just
at
that
moment
a
man
who
was
passing
by
took
up
the
words
and
called
out
luck
perhaps
but
not
for
long
you
crowd
of
on
arriving
at
the
palace
we
all
three
got
out
of
the
carriage
and
were
shown
into
a
small
yellow
on
the
ground
floor
will
go
and
inform
his
majesty
that
you
are
here
said
de
laferrière
leaving
us
when
alone
with
madame
guérard
i
thought
i
would
rehearse
my
three
curtseys
petit
i
said
me
whether
they
are
i
made
the
curtseys
murmuring
sire
i
began
over
again
several
times
looking
down
at
my
dress
as
i
said
when
suddenly
i
heard
a
stifled
laugh
i
stood
up
quickly
furious
with
madame
guérard
but
i
saw
that
she
too
was
bent
over
in
a
half
circle
i
turned
round
quickly
and
behind
me
was
the
emperor
he
was
clapping
his
hands
silently
and
laughing
quietly
but
still
he
laughing
my
face
flushed
and
i
was
embarrassed
for
i
wondered
how
long
he
had
been
there
i
had
been
curtseying
i
do
not
know
how
many
times
trying
to
get
my
reverence
right
and
saying
too
low
there
is
that
right
guérard
heavens
i
now
said
to
myself
he
heard
it
all
in
spite
of
my
confusion
i
now
made
my
curtsey
again
but
the
emperor
said
smiling
no
it
could
not
be
better
than
it
was
just
now
save
them
for
the
empress
who
is
expecting
oh
that
i
wondered
when
it
had
been
i
could
not
question
madame
guérard
as
she
was
following
at
some
distance
with
de
laferrière
the
emperor
was
at
my
side
talking
to
me
of
a
hundred
things
but
i
could
only
answer
in
an
way
on
account
of
that
i
liked
him
much
better
thus
quite
near
than
in
his
portraits
he
had
such
fine
eyes
which
he
half
closed
whilst
looking
through
his
long
lashes
his
smile
was
sad
and
rather
mocking
his
face
was
pale
and
his
voice
faint
but
seductive
we
found
the
empress
seated
in
a
large
her
body
was
sheathed
in
a
grey
dress
and
seemed
to
have
been
moulded
into
the
material
i
thought
her
very
beautiful
she
too
was
more
beautiful
than
her
portraits
i
made
my
three
curtseys
under
the
laughing
eyes
of
the
emperor
the
empress
spoke
and
the
spell
was
then
broken
that
rough
hard
voice
coming
from
that
brilliant
woman
gave
me
a
shock
from
that
moment
i
felt
ill
at
ease
with
her
in
spite
of
her
graciousness
and
her
kindness
as
soon
as
agar
arrived
and
had
been
introduced
the
empress
had
us
conducted
to
the
large
where
the
performance
was
to
take
place
the
measurements
were
taken
for
the
platform
and
there
was
to
be
the
flight
of
steps
where
agar
had
to
pose
as
the
unhappy
courtesan
cursing
mercenary
love
and
longing
for
ideal
love
this
flight
of
steps
was
quite
a
problem
they
were
supposed
to
represent
the
first
three
steps
of
a
huge
flight
leading
up
to
a
florentine
palace
and
had
to
be
half
hidden
in
some
way
i
asked
for
some
shrubs
flowers
and
plants
which
i
arranged
along
the
three
steps
the
prince
imperial
who
had
come
in
was
then
about
thirteen
years
of
age
he
helped
me
to
arrange
the
plants
and
laughed
wildly
when
agar
mounted
the
steps
to
try
the
effect
he
was
delicious
with
his
magnificent
eyes
with
heavy
lids
like
those
of
his
mother
and
with
his
long
eyelashes
he
was
witty
like
the
emperor
whom
people
surnamed
the
imbecile
and
who
certainly
had
the
most
refined
subtle
and
at
the
same
time
the
most
generous
wit
we
arranged
everything
as
well
as
we
could
and
it
was
decided
that
we
should
return
two
days
later
for
a
rehearsal
before
their
majesties
how
gracefully
the
prince
imperial
asked
permission
to
be
present
at
the
rehearsal
his
request
was
granted
and
the
empress
then
took
leave
of
us
in
the
most
charming
manner
but
her
voice
was
very
ugly
she
told
the
two
ladies
who
were
with
her
to
give
us
wine
and
biscuits
and
to
show
us
over
the
palace
if
we
wished
to
see
it
i
did
not
care
much
about
this
but
petit
and
agar
seemed
so
delighted
at
the
offer
that
i
gave
in
to
them
i
have
regretted
ever
since
that
i
did
so
for
nothing
could
have
been
uglier
than
the
private
rooms
with
the
exception
of
the
study
and
the
staircases
this
inspection
of
the
palace
bored
me
terribly
a
few
of
the
pictures
consoled
me
and
i
stayed
some
time
gazing
at
portrait
representing
the
empress
eugénie
she
looked
beautiful
and
i
thanked
heaven
that
the
portrait
could
not
speak
for
it
served
to
explain
and
justify
the
wonderful
good
luck
of
her
majesty
the
rehearsal
took
place
without
any
special
incident
the
young
prince
did
his
utmost
to
prove
to
us
his
gratitude
and
delight
for
we
had
made
it
a
dress
rehearsal
on
his
account
as
he
was
not
to
be
present
at
the
he
sketched
my
costume
and
intended
to
have
it
copied
for
a
which
was
to
be
given
for
the
imperial
child
our
performance
was
in
honour
of
the
queen
of
holland
accompanied
by
the
prince
of
orange
commonly
known
in
paris
as
a
rather
amusing
incident
occurred
during
the
evening
the
empress
had
remarkably
small
feet
and
in
order
to
make
them
look
still
smaller
she
encased
them
in
shoes
that
were
too
narrow
she
looked
wonderfully
beautiful
that
night
with
her
pretty
sloping
shoulders
emerging
from
a
dress
of
pale
blue
satin
embroidered
with
silver
on
her
lovely
hair
she
was
wearing
a
little
diadem
of
turquoises
and
diamonds
and
her
small
feet
were
on
a
cushion
of
silver
brocade
all
through
piece
my
eyes
wandered
frequently
to
this
cushion
and
i
saw
the
two
little
feet
moving
restlessly
about
finally
i
saw
one
of
the
shoes
pushing
its
little
brother
very
very
gently
and
then
i
saw
the
heel
of
the
empress
come
out
of
its
prison
the
foot
was
then
only
covered
at
the
toe
and
i
was
very
anxious
to
know
how
it
would
get
back
for
under
such
circumstances
the
foot
swells
and
can
not
go
into
a
shoe
that
is
too
narrow
when
the
piece
was
over
we
were
recalled
twice
and
as
it
was
the
empress
who
started
the
applause
i
thought
she
was
putting
off
the
moment
for
getting
up
and
i
saw
her
pretty
little
sore
foot
trying
in
vain
to
get
back
into
its
shoe
the
curtains
were
drawn
and
as
i
had
told
agar
about
the
cushion
drama
we
watched
through
them
its
various
phases
the
emperor
rose
and
every
one
followed
his
example
he
offered
his
arm
to
the
queen
of
holland
but
she
looked
at
the
empress
who
had
not
yet
risen
the
face
lighted
up
with
that
smile
which
i
had
already
seen
he
said
a
word
to
general
fleury
and
immediately
the
generals
and
other
officers
on
duty
who
were
seated
behind
the
sovereigns
formed
a
rampart
between
the
crowd
and
the
empress
the
emperor
and
the
queen
of
holland
then
passed
on
without
appearing
to
have
noticed
her
distress
and
the
prince
of
orange
with
one
knee
on
the
ground
helped
the
beautiful
sovereign
to
put
on
her
slipper
i
saw
that
the
empress
leaned
more
heavily
on
the
arm
than
she
would
have
liked
for
her
pretty
foot
was
evidently
rather
painful
we
were
then
sent
for
to
be
complimented
and
we
were
surrounded
and
fêted
so
much
that
we
were
delighted
with
our
evening
after
and
the
prodigious
success
of
that
adorable
piece
a
success
in
which
agar
and
i
had
our
share
chilly
thought
more
of
me
and
began
to
like
me
he
insisted
on
paying
for
our
costumes
which
was
great
extravagance
for
him
i
had
become
the
adored
queen
of
the
students
and
i
used
to
receive
little
bouquets
of
violets
sonnets
and
long
long
poems
too
long
to
read
sometimes
on
arriving
at
the
theatre
as
i
was
getting
out
of
my
carriage
i
received
a
shower
of
flowers
which
simply
covered
me
and
i
was
delighted
and
used
to
thank
my
worshippers
the
only
thing
was
that
their
admiration
blinded
them
so
that
when
in
some
pieces
i
was
not
so
good
and
the
house
was
rather
chary
of
applause
my
little
army
of
students
would
be
indignant
and
would
cheer
wildly
without
rhyme
or
reason
i
can
understand
quite
well
that
this
used
to
exasperate
the
regular
subscribers
of
the
odéon
who
were
very
kindly
disposed
towards
me
nevertheless
as
they
too
used
to
spoil
me
but
they
would
have
liked
me
to
be
more
humble
and
meek
and
less
headstrong
how
many
times
one
or
another
of
these
old
subscribers
would
come
and
give
me
a
word
of
advice
you
were
charming
in
one
of
them
observed
you
bite
your
lips
and
the
roman
women
never
did
that
dear
girl
another
said
were
delicious
in
le
but
there
is
not
a
single
breton
woman
in
the
whole
of
brittany
with
her
hair
a
professor
from
the
sorbonne
said
to
me
one
day
rather
curtly
is
a
want
of
respect
mademoiselle
to
turn
your
back
on
the
public
monsieur
i
replied
was
accompanying
an
old
lady
to
a
door
at
the
back
of
the
stage
i
could
not
walk
along
with
her
artistes
we
had
before
you
mademoiselle
who
were
quite
as
talented
as
you
if
not
more
so
had
a
way
of
going
across
the
stage
without
turning
their
back
on
the
and
he
turned
quickly
on
his
heel
and
was
going
away
when
i
stopped
him
will
you
go
to
that
door
through
which
you
intended
to
pass
without
turning
your
back
on
me
he
made
an
attempt
and
then
furious
turned
his
back
on
me
and
disappeared
slamming
the
door
after
him
i
lived
some
time
at
rue
auber
in
a
flat
on
the
first
floor
which
was
rather
a
nice
one
i
had
furnished
it
with
old
dutch
furniture
which
my
grandmother
had
sent
me
my
godfather
advised
me
to
insure
against
fire
as
this
furniture
he
told
me
constituted
a
small
fortune
i
decided
to
follow
his
advice
and
asked
petit
to
take
the
necessary
steps
for
me
a
few
days
later
she
told
me
that
some
one
would
call
about
it
on
the
on
the
day
in
question
towards
two
a
gentleman
called
but
i
was
in
an
extremely
nervous
condition
and
said
i
must
be
left
alone
i
do
not
wish
to
see
any
i
had
refused
to
be
disturbed
and
had
shut
myself
up
in
my
bedroom
in
a
frightfully
depressed
state
that
same
evening
i
received
a
letter
from
the
fire
insurance
company
la
foncière
asking
which
day
their
agent
might
call
to
have
the
agreement
signed
i
replied
that
he
might
come
on
saturday
on
friday
i
was
so
utterly
wretched
that
i
sent
to
ask
my
mother
to
come
and
lunch
with
me
i
was
not
playing
that
day
as
i
never
used
to
perform
on
tuesdays
and
fridays
days
on
which
répertoire
plays
only
were
given
as
i
was
playing
every
other
day
in
new
pieces
it
was
feared
that
i
should
be
my
mother
on
arriving
thought
i
looked
very
pale
i
replied
do
not
know
what
is
the
matter
with
me
but
i
am
in
a
very
nervous
state
and
most
the
governess
came
to
fetch
my
little
boy
to
take
him
out
for
a
walk
but
i
would
not
let
him
go
no
i
exclaimed
child
must
not
leave
me
i
am
afraid
of
something
what
happened
was
fortunately
of
a
less
serious
nature
than
with
my
love
for
my
family
i
was
dreading
i
had
my
grandmother
living
with
me
at
that
time
and
she
was
blind
it
was
the
grandmother
who
had
given
me
most
of
my
furniture
she
was
a
woman
and
her
beauty
was
of
a
cold
hard
type
she
was
very
tall
indeed
six
feet
but
she
looked
like
a
giantess
she
was
thin
and
very
upright
and
her
long
arms
were
always
stretched
in
front
of
her
feeling
for
all
the
objects
in
her
way
so
that
she
might
not
knock
herself
although
she
was
always
accompanied
by
the
nurse
whom
i
had
engaged
for
her
above
this
long
body
was
her
little
face
with
two
immense
pale
blue
eyes
which
were
always
open
even
when
asleep
at
night
she
was
generally
dressed
from
head
to
foot
in
grey
and
this
neutral
colour
gave
something
unreal
to
her
general
appearance
my
mother
after
trying
to
comfort
me
went
away
about
two
my
grandmother
seated
opposite
me
in
her
large
voltaire
armchair
questioned
me
are
you
afraid
of
she
asked
are
you
so
mournful
i
have
not
heard
you
laugh
all
i
did
not
answer
but
looked
at
my
grandmother
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
trouble
i
was
dreading
would
come
through
her
you
not
there
she
insisted
i
am
here
i
answered
please
do
not
talk
to
she
did
not
utter
another
word
but
with
her
two
hands
on
her
lap
sat
there
for
hours
i
sketched
her
strange
fatidical
face
it
began
to
grow
dusk
and
i
thought
i
would
go
and
dress
after
being
present
at
the
meal
taken
by
my
grandmother
and
the
child
my
friend
rose
baretta
was
dining
with
me
that
evening
and
i
had
also
invited
a
most
charming
and
witty
man
charles
haas
arthur
meyer
came
too
he
was
a
young
journalist
already
very
much
in
vogue
i
told
them
about
my
forebodings
with
regard
to
that
day
and
begged
them
not
to
leave
me
before
midnight
that
i
said
will
not
be
and
the
wicked
spirits
who
are
watching
me
will
have
missed
their
they
agreed
to
humour
my
fancy
and
arthur
meyer
who
was
to
have
gone
to
some
first
night
at
one
of
the
theatres
remained
with
us
dinner
was
more
animated
than
luncheon
had
been
and
it
was
nine
when
we
left
the
table
rose
baretta
sang
us
some
delightful
old
songs
i
went
away
for
a
minute
to
see
that
all
was
right
in
my
room
i
found
my
maid
with
her
head
wrapped
up
in
cloths
soaked
in
sedative
water
i
asked
what
was
the
matter
and
she
said
that
she
had
a
terrible
headache
i
told
her
to
prepare
my
bath
and
everything
for
me
for
the
night
and
then
to
go
to
bed
she
thanked
me
and
obeyed
i
went
back
to
the
and
sitting
down
to
the
piano
played
bacio
and
i
had
not
come
to
the
end
of
this
last
melody
when
i
stopped
suddenly
hearing
in
the
street
cries
of
fire
are
shouting
exclaimed
arthur
meyer
all
the
same
to
me
i
said
shrugging
my
shoulders
is
not
midnight
yet
and
i
am
expecting
my
own
charles
haas
had
opened
the
window
to
see
where
the
shouts
were
coming
from
he
stepped
out
on
to
the
balcony
and
then
came
quickly
in
again
fire
is
here
he
exclaimed
i
rushed
to
the
window
and
saw
the
flames
coming
from
the
two
windows
of
my
bedroom
i
ran
back
through
the
in
to
the
corridor
and
then
to
the
room
where
my
child
was
sleeping
with
his
governess
and
his
nurse
they
were
all
fast
asleep
arthur
meyer
opened
the
hall
door
the
bell
of
which
was
being
rung
violently
i
roused
the
two
women
quickly
wrapped
the
sleeping
child
in
his
blankets
and
rushed
to
the
door
with
my
precious
burden
i
then
ran
downstairs
and
crossing
the
street
took
him
to
chocolate
shop
opposite
just
at
the
corner
of
the
rue
caumartin
the
kind
man
took
my
little
slumberer
in
and
let
him
lie
on
a
couch
where
the
child
continued
his
sleep
without
any
break
i
left
him
in
charge
of
his
governess
and
his
nurse
and
went
quickly
back
to
the
flaming
house
the
firemen
who
had
been
sent
for
had
not
yet
arrived
and
at
all
costs
i
was
determined
to
rescue
my
poor
grandmother
it
was
impossible
to
go
back
up
the
principal
staircase
as
it
was
filled
with
smoke
charles
haas
bareheaded
and
in
evening
dress
a
flower
in
his
started
with
me
up
the
narrow
back
staircase
we
were
soon
on
the
first
floor
but
when
once
there
my
knees
shook
it
seemed
as
thought
my
heart
had
stopped
and
i
was
seized
with
despair
the
kitchen
door
at
the
top
of
the
first
flight
of
stairs
was
locked
with
a
triple
turn
of
the
key
my
amiable
companion
was
tall
slight
and
elegant
but
not
strong
i
besought
him
to
go
down
and
fetch
a
hammer
a
hatchet
or
something
but
just
at
that
moment
a
newcomer
wrenched
the
door
open
by
a
violent
plunge
with
his
shoulder
against
it
this
new
arrival
was
no
other
than
sohège
a
friend
of
mine
he
was
a
most
charming
and
excellent
man
a
alsatian
well
known
in
paris
very
lively
and
kind
and
always
ready
to
do
any
one
a
service
i
took
my
friends
to
my
room
she
was
sitting
up
in
bed
out
of
breath
with
calling
catherine
the
servant
who
waited
upon
her
this
maid
was
about
years
of
age
a
big
strapping
girl
from
burgundy
and
she
was
now
sleeping
peacefully
in
spite
of
the
uproar
in
the
street
the
noise
of
the
which
had
arrived
at
last
and
the
wild
shrieks
of
the
occupants
of
the
house
sohège
shook
the
maid
whilst
i
explained
to
my
grandmother
the
reason
of
the
tumult
and
why
we
were
in
her
room
good
she
said
and
then
she
added
calmly
you
give
me
the
box
sarah
that
you
will
find
at
the
bottom
of
the
wardrobe
the
key
of
it
is
grandmother
i
exclaimed
smoke
is
beginning
to
come
in
here
we
have
not
any
time
to
do
as
you
like
i
shall
not
leave
without
my
box
with
the
help
of
charles
haas
and
of
arthur
meyer
we
put
my
grandmother
on
back
in
spite
of
herself
he
was
of
medium
height
and
she
was
extremely
tall
so
that
her
long
legs
touched
the
ground
and
i
was
afraid
she
might
get
them
injured
sohège
therefore
took
her
in
his
arms
and
charles
haas
carried
her
legs
we
then
set
off
but
the
smoke
stifled
us
and
after
descending
about
ten
stairs
i
fell
down
in
a
faint
when
i
came
to
myself
i
was
in
my
bed
my
little
boy
was
asleep
in
my
room
and
my
grandmother
was
installed
in
a
large
armchair
she
sat
bolt
upright
frowning
and
with
an
angry
expression
on
her
lips
she
did
not
trouble
about
anything
but
her
box
until
at
last
my
mother
was
angry
and
reproached
her
in
dutch
with
only
caring
for
herself
she
answered
excitedly
and
her
neck
craned
forward
as
though
to
help
her
head
to
peer
through
the
perpetual
darkness
which
surrounded
her
her
thin
body
wrapped
in
an
indian
shawl
of
many
colours
the
hissing
of
her
strident
words
which
flowed
freely
all
contributed
to
make
her
resemble
a
serpent
in
some
terrible
nightmare
my
mother
did
not
like
this
woman
who
had
married
my
grandfather
when
he
had
six
big
children
the
eldest
of
whom
was
sixteen
and
the
youngest
my
uncle
five
years
this
second
wife
had
never
had
any
children
of
her
own
and
had
been
indifferent
even
harsh
towards
those
of
her
husband
and
consequently
she
was
not
liked
in
the
family
i
had
taken
charge
of
her
because
had
broken
out
in
the
family
with
whom
she
had
been
boarding
she
had
then
wished
to
stay
with
me
and
i
had
not
had
courage
enough
to
oppose
her
on
the
occasion
of
the
fire
though
i
considered
she
behaved
so
badly
that
a
strong
dislike
to
her
came
over
me
and
i
resolved
not
to
keep
her
with
me
news
of
the
fire
was
brought
to
us
it
continued
to
rage
and
burnt
everything
in
my
flat
absolutely
everything
even
to
the
very
last
book
in
my
library
my
greatest
sorrow
was
that
i
had
lost
a
magnificent
portrait
of
my
mother
by
bassompierre
severin
a
pastelist
very
much
la
under
the
empire
an
oil
portrait
of
my
father
and
a
very
pretty
pastel
of
my
sister
jeanne
i
had
not
much
jewellery
and
all
that
was
found
of
the
bracelet
given
to
me
by
the
emperor
was
a
huge
shapeless
mass
which
i
still
have
i
had
a
very
pretty
diadem
set
with
diamonds
and
pearls
given
to
me
by
kalil
bey
after
a
performance
at
his
house
the
ashes
of
this
had
to
be
sifted
in
order
to
find
the
stones
the
diamonds
were
there
but
the
pearls
had
melted
i
was
absolutely
ruined
for
the
money
that
my
father
and
his
mother
had
left
me
i
had
spent
in
furniture
curiosities
and
a
hundred
other
useless
things
which
were
the
delight
of
my
life
i
had
too
and
i
own
it
was
absurd
a
tortoise
named
chrysagère
its
back
was
covered
with
a
shell
of
gold
set
with
very
small
blue
pink
and
yellow
topazes
oh
how
beautiful
it
was
and
how
droll
it
used
to
wander
round
my
flat
accompanied
by
a
smaller
tortoise
named
zerbinette
which
was
its
servant
and
i
used
to
amuse
myself
for
hours
watching
chrysagère
flashing
with
a
hundred
lights
under
the
rays
of
the
sun
or
the
moon
both
my
tortoises
died
in
this
fire
duquesnel
who
was
very
kind
to
me
at
that
time
came
to
see
me
a
few
weeks
later
for
he
had
just
received
a
summons
from
la
foncière
the
fire
insurance
company
whose
papers
i
had
refused
to
sign
the
day
before
the
catastrophe
the
company
claimed
a
heavy
sum
of
money
from
me
for
damages
done
to
the
house
itself
the
second
storey
was
almost
entirely
destroyed
and
for
many
months
the
whole
building
had
to
be
propped
up
i
did
not
possess
the
francs
claimed
duquesnel
offered
to
give
a
benefit
performance
for
me
which
would
he
said
free
me
from
all
difficulties
de
chilly
was
very
willing
to
agree
to
anything
that
would
be
of
service
to
me
the
benefit
was
a
wonderful
success
thanks
to
the
presence
of
the
adorable
adelina
patti
the
young
singer
who
was
then
the
marquise
de
caux
had
never
before
sung
at
a
benefit
performance
and
it
was
arthur
meyer
who
brought
me
the
news
that
was
going
to
sing
for
me
her
husband
came
during
the
afternoon
to
tell
me
how
glad
she
was
of
this
opportunity
of
proving
to
me
her
sympathy
as
soon
as
the
was
announced
every
seat
in
the
house
was
promptly
taken
at
prices
which
were
higher
than
those
originally
fixed
she
had
no
reason
to
regret
her
friendly
action
for
never
was
any
triumph
more
complete
the
students
greeted
her
with
three
cheers
as
she
came
on
the
stage
she
was
a
little
surprised
at
this
noise
of
bravos
in
rhythm
i
can
see
her
now
coming
forward
her
two
little
feet
encased
in
pink
satin
she
was
like
a
bird
hesitating
as
to
whether
it
would
fly
or
remain
on
the
ground
she
looked
so
pretty
so
smiling
and
when
she
trilled
out
the
notes
of
her
wonderful
voice
the
whole
house
was
delirious
with
excitement
every
one
sprang
up
and
the
students
stood
on
their
seats
waved
their
hats
and
handkerchiefs
nodded
their
young
heads
in
their
feverish
enthusiasm
for
art
and
with
intonations
of
the
most
touching
supplication
the
divine
singer
then
began
again
and
three
times
over
she
had
to
sing
the
cavatina
from
barbière
de
seville
voce
poco
i
thanked
her
affectionately
afterwards
and
she
left
the
theatre
escorted
by
the
students
who
followed
her
carriage
for
a
long
way
shouting
over
and
over
again
live
adelina
patti
thanks
to
that
performance
i
was
able
to
pay
the
insurance
company
i
was
ruined
all
the
same
or
very
nearly
so
i
stayed
a
few
days
with
my
mother
but
we
were
so
cramped
for
room
there
that
i
took
a
furnished
flat
in
the
rue
de
it
was
a
dismal
house
and
the
flat
was
dark
i
was
wondering
how
i
should
get
out
of
my
difficulties
when
one
morning
c
my
notary
was
announced
this
was
the
man
i
disliked
so
much
but
i
gave
orders
that
he
should
be
shown
in
i
was
surprised
that
i
had
not
seen
him
for
so
long
a
time
he
told
me
that
he
had
just
returned
from
hamburg
that
he
had
seen
in
the
newspaper
an
account
of
my
misfortune
and
had
now
come
to
put
himself
at
my
service
in
spite
of
my
distrust
i
was
touched
by
this
and
i
related
to
him
the
whole
drama
of
my
fire
i
did
not
know
how
it
had
started
but
i
vaguely
suspected
my
maid
josephine
of
having
placed
my
lighted
candle
on
the
little
table
to
the
left
of
the
head
of
my
bed
i
had
frequently
warned
her
not
to
do
this
but
it
was
on
this
little
piece
of
furniture
that
she
always
placed
my
and
glass
and
a
dessert
dish
with
a
couple
of
raw
apples
for
i
adore
eating
apples
when
i
wake
in
the
night
on
opening
the
door
there
was
always
a
terrible
draught
as
the
windows
were
left
open
until
i
went
to
bed
on
closing
the
door
after
her
the
lace
had
probably
caught
fire
i
could
not
explain
the
catastrophe
in
any
other
way
i
had
several
times
seen
the
young
servant
do
this
stupid
thing
and
i
supposed
that
on
the
night
in
question
she
had
been
in
a
hurry
to
go
to
bed
on
account
of
her
bad
headache
as
a
rule
when
i
was
going
to
undress
myself
she
prepared
everything
and
then
came
in
and
told
me
but
this
time
she
had
not
done
so
usually
too
i
just
went
into
the
room
myself
to
see
that
everything
was
right
and
several
times
i
had
been
obliged
to
move
the
candle
that
day
however
was
destined
to
bring
me
misfortune
of
some
kind
though
it
was
not
a
very
great
one
said
the
notary
were
not
insured
then
i
was
to
sign
my
policy
the
day
after
the
exclaimed
the
man
of
law
to
think
that
i
have
been
told
you
set
the
flat
on
fire
yourself
in
order
to
receive
a
large
sum
of
money
i
shrugged
my
shoulders
for
i
had
seen
insinuations
to
this
effect
in
a
newspaper
i
was
very
young
at
this
time
but
i
already
had
a
certain
disdain
for
well
i
must
arrange
matters
for
you
if
things
are
like
this
said
maître
c
are
really
better
off
than
you
imagine
as
regards
the
money
on
your
side
he
continued
your
grandmother
leaves
you
an
annuity
you
can
get
a
good
amount
for
this
by
agreeing
to
insure
your
life
for
francs
for
forty
years
for
the
benefit
of
the
i
agreed
to
everything
and
was
only
too
delighted
at
such
a
windfall
this
man
promised
to
send
me
two
days
after
his
return
francs
and
he
kept
his
word
my
reason
for
giving
the
details
of
this
little
episode
which
after
all
belongs
to
my
life
is
to
show
how
differently
things
turn
out
from
what
seems
likely
according
to
logic
or
according
to
our
own
expectations
it
is
quite
certain
that
the
accident
which
had
just
then
happened
to
me
scattered
to
the
winds
the
hopes
and
plans
of
my
life
i
had
arranged
for
myself
a
luxurious
home
with
the
money
that
my
father
and
mother
had
left
me
i
had
kept
by
me
and
invested
a
sufficient
amount
of
money
so
as
to
be
sure
to
complete
my
monthly
salary
for
the
next
two
years
i
reckoned
that
at
the
end
of
the
two
years
i
should
be
in
a
position
to
demand
a
very
high
salary
and
all
these
arrangements
had
been
upset
by
the
carelessness
of
a
domestic
i
had
rich
relatives
and
very
rich
friends
but
not
one
amongst
them
stretched
out
a
hand
to
help
me
out
of
the
ditch
into
which
i
had
fallen
my
rich
relatives
had
not
forgiven
me
for
going
on
to
the
stage
and
yet
heaven
knows
what
tears
it
had
cost
me
to
take
up
this
career
that
had
been
forced
upon
me
my
uncle
faure
came
to
see
me
at
my
house
but
my
aunt
would
not
listen
to
a
word
about
me
i
used
to
see
my
cousin
secretly
and
sometimes
his
pretty
sister
my
rich
friends
considered
that
i
was
wildly
extravagant
and
could
not
understand
why
i
did
not
place
the
money
i
had
inherited
in
good
sound
investments
i
received
a
great
deal
of
verse
on
the
subject
of
my
fire
most
of
it
was
anonymous
i
have
kept
it
all
however
and
i
quote
the
following
poem
which
is
rather
nice
passant
te

the
proprietor
of
one
of
the
hotels
now
very
much
in
vogue
sent
me
the
following
letter
which
i
quote
word
for
word
if
you
would
consent
to
dine
every
evening
for
a
month
in
our
large
i
would
place
at
your
service
a
suite
of
rooms
on
the
first
floor
consisting
of
two
bedrooms
a
large
a
small
boudoir
and
a
it
is
of
course
understood
that
this
suite
of
rooms
would
be
yours
free
of
charge
if
you
would
consent
to
do
as
i
yours
etc
you
would
only
have
to
pay
for
the
fresh
supplies
of
plants
for
your
this
was
the
extent
of
the
coarseness
i
asked
one
of
my
friends
to
go
and
give
the
low
fellow
his
answer
i
was
in
despair
though
for
i
felt
that
i
could
not
live
without
comfort
and
luxury
i
soon
made
up
my
mind
as
to
what
i
must
do
but
not
without
sorrow
i
had
been
offered
a
magnificent
engagement
in
russia
and
i
should
have
to
accept
it
madame
guérard
was
my
sole
confidant
and
i
did
not
mention
my
plan
to
any
one
else
the
idea
of
russia
terrified
her
for
at
that
time
my
chest
was
very
delicate
and
cold
was
my
most
cruel
enemy
it
was
just
as
i
had
made
up
my
mind
to
this
that
the
lawyer
arrived
his
avaricious
and
crafty
mind
had
schemed
out
the
clever
and
for
him
profitable
combination
which
was
to
change
my
whole
life
once
more
i
took
a
pretty
flat
on
the
first
floor
of
a
house
in
the
rue
de
rome
it
was
very
sunny
and
that
delighted
me
more
than
anything
else
there
were
two
and
a
large
i
arranged
for
my
grandmother
to
live
at
a
home
kept
by
lay
sisters
and
nuns
she
was
a
jewess
and
carried
out
very
strictly
all
the
laws
laid
down
by
her
religion
the
house
was
very
comfortable
and
my
grandmother
took
her
own
maid
with
her
the
young
girl
from
burgundy
to
whom
she
was
accustomed
when
i
went
to
see
her
she
told
me
that
she
was
much
better
off
there
than
with
me
i
was
with
you
she
said
found
your
boy
too
i
very
rarely
went
to
visit
her
there
for
after
seeing
my
mother
turn
pale
at
her
unkind
words
i
never
cared
any
more
for
her
she
was
happy
and
that
was
the
essential
thing
i
now
played
successfully
in
in
which
i
had
great
success
in
in
by
george
sand
and
in
a
little
masterpiece
by
andré
theuriet
which
had
the
most
brilliant
success
porel
played
the
part
of
he
was
at
that
time
slender
and
full
of
hope
since
then
his
slenderness
has
developed
into
plumpness
and
his
hope
into
certitude
xv
the
war
evil
days
then
came
upon
us
paris
began
to
get
feverish
and
excited
the
streets
were
black
with
groups
of
people
discussing
and
gesticulating
and
all
this
noise
was
only
the
echo
of
groups
gathered
together
in
german
streets
these
other
groups
were
yelling
gesticulating
and
discussing
but
they
knew
whilst
we
did
not
know
i
could
not
keep
calm
but
was
extremely
excited
until
finally
i
was
war
was
declared
and
i
hate
war
it
exasperates
me
and
makes
me
shudder
from
head
to
foot
at
times
i
used
to
spring
up
terrified
upset
by
the
distant
cries
of
human
voices
oh
war
what
infamy
shame
and
sorrow
war
what
theft
and
crime
abetted
forgiven
and
glorified
recently
i
visited
a
huge
steel
works
i
will
not
say
in
what
country
for
all
countries
have
been
hospitable
to
me
and
i
am
neither
a
spy
nor
a
traitress
i
only
set
forth
things
as
i
see
them
well
i
visited
one
of
these
frightful
manufactories
in
which
the
most
deadly
weapons
are
made
the
owner
of
it
all
a
was
introduced
to
me
he
was
pleasant
but
no
good
at
conversation
and
he
had
a
dreamy
dissatisfied
look
my
cicerone
informed
me
that
this
man
had
just
lost
a
huge
sum
of
money
nearly
sixty
million
francs
heavens
i
exclaimed
has
he
lost
it
well
he
has
not
exactly
lost
the
money
but
has
just
missed
making
the
sum
so
it
amounts
to
the
same
i
looked
perplexed
and
he
added
you
remember
that
there
was
a
great
deal
of
talk
about
war
between
france
and
germany
with
regard
to
the
morocco
affair
this
prince
of
the
steel
trade
expected
to
sell
cannons
for
it
and
for
a
month
his
men
were
very
busy
in
the
factory
working
day
and
night
he
gave
enormous
bribes
to
influential
members
of
the
government
and
paid
some
of
the
papers
in
france
and
germany
to
stir
up
the
people
everything
has
fallen
through
thanks
to
the
intervention
of
men
who
are
wise
and
humanitarian
the
consequence
is
that
this
millionaire
is
in
despair
he
has
lost
sixty
or
perhaps
a
hundred
million
i
looked
at
the
wretched
man
with
contempt
and
i
wished
heartily
that
he
could
be
suffocated
with
his
millions
as
remorse
was
no
doubt
utterly
unknown
to
him
and
how
many
others
merit
our
contempt
just
as
this
man
does
nearly
all
those
who
are
known
as
to
the
army
in
every
country
in
the
world
are
the
most
desperate
propagators
of
war
let
every
man
be
a
soldier
in
the
time
of
peril
yes
a
thousand
times
over
yes
let
every
man
be
armed
for
the
defence
of
his
country
and
let
him
kill
in
order
to
defend
his
family
and
himself
that
is
only
reasonable
but
that
there
should
be
in
our
times
young
men
whose
sole
dream
is
to
kill
in
order
to
make
a
position
for
themselves
that
is
inconceivable
it
is
indisputable
that
we
must
guard
our
frontiers
and
our
colonies
but
since
all
men
are
soldiers
why
not
take
these
guards
and
defenders
from
among
we
should
only
have
schools
for
officers
then
and
we
should
have
no
more
of
those
horrible
barracks
which
offend
the
eye
and
when
sovereigns
visit
each
other
and
are
invited
to
a
review
would
they
not
be
much
more
edified
as
to
the
value
of
a
nation
if
it
could
show
a
thousandth
part
of
its
effective
force
chosen
among
its
soldiers
rather
than
the
elegant
evolutions
of
an
army
prepared
for
parade
what
magnificent
reviews
i
have
seen
in
all
the
different
countries
i
have
visited
but
i
know
from
history
that
such
and
such
an
army
as
was
prancing
about
there
so
finely
before
us
had
taken
flight
without
any
great
reason
before
the
enemy
on
july
war
was
seriously
declared
and
paris
then
became
the
theatre
of
the
most
touching
and
burlesque
scenes
excitable
and
delicate
as
i
was
i
could
not
bear
the
sight
of
all
these
young
men
gone
wild
who
were
yelling
the
and
rushing
along
the
streets
in
close
file
shouting
over
and
over
again
berlin
to
berlin
my
heart
used
to
beat
wildly
for
i
too
thought
that
they
were
going
to
berlin
i
understood
the
fury
they
felt
for
these
people
had
provoked
us
without
plausible
reasons
but
at
the
same
time
it
seemed
to
me
that
they
were
getting
ready
for
this
great
deed
without
sufficient
respect
and
dignity
my
own
impotence
made
me
feel
rebellious
and
when
i
saw
all
the
mothers
with
pale
faces
and
eyes
swollen
with
crying
holding
their
boys
in
their
arms
and
kissing
them
in
despair
the
most
frightful
anguish
seemed
to
choke
me
i
cried
too
almost
unceasingly
and
i
was
wearing
myself
away
with
anxiety
but
i
did
not
foresee
the
horrible
catastrophe
that
was
to
take
place
the
doctors
decided
that
i
must
go
to
i
did
not
want
to
leave
paris
for
i
had
caught
the
general
fever
of
excitement
my
weakness
increased
though
day
by
day
and
on
july
i
was
taken
away
in
spite
of
myself
madame
guérard
my
and
my
maid
accompanied
me
and
i
also
took
my
child
with
me
in
all
the
railway
stations
there
were
posters
everywhere
announcing
that
the
emperor
napoleon
had
gone
to
metz
to
take
command
of
the
army
at
i
was
compelled
to
remain
in
bed
my
condition
was
considered
very
serious
by
leudet
who
told
me
afterwards
that
he
certainly
thought
i
was
going
to
die
i
vomited
blood
and
had
to
have
a
piece
of
ice
in
my
mouth
all
the
time
at
the
end
of
about
twelve
days
however
i
began
to
get
up
and
after
this
i
soon
recovered
my
strength
and
my
calmness
and
went
for
long
rides
on
horseback
the
war
news
led
us
to
hope
for
victory
there
was
great
joy
and
a
certain
emotion
felt
by
every
one
on
hearing
that
the
young
prince
imperial
had
received
his
baptism
of
fire
at
saarbruck
in
the
engagement
commanded
by
general
frossard
life
seemed
to
me
beautiful
again
for
i
had
great
confidence
in
the
issue
of
the
war
i
pitied
the
germans
for
having
embarked
on
such
an
adventure
but
alas
the
fine
glorious
progress
which
my
brain
had
been
so
active
in
imagining
was
cut
short
by
the
atrocious
news
from
the
political
news
was
posted
up
every
day
in
the
little
garden
of
the
casino
at
the
public
went
there
to
get
information
detesting
as
i
did
tranquillity
i
used
to
send
my
to
copy
the
telegrams
oh
how
grievous
was
that
terrible
telegram
from
informing
us
laconically
of
the
frightful
butchery
of
the
heroic
defence
of
marshal
canrobert
and
of
first
treachery
in
not
going
to
the
rescue
of
his
comrade
i
knew
canrobert
and
was
very
fond
of
him
later
on
he
became
one
of
my
faithful
friends
and
i
shall
always
remember
the
exquisite
hours
spent
in
listening
to
his
accounts
of
the
bravery
of
others
never
of
his
own
and
what
an
abundance
of
anecdotes
what
wit
what
charm
this
news
of
the
battle
of
caused
my
feverishness
to
return
my
sleep
was
full
of
nightmares
and
i
had
a
relapse
the
news
was
worse
every
day
after
came
gravelotte
where
men
french
and
german
were
cut
down
in
a
few
hours
then
came
the
sublime
but
powerless
efforts
of
macmahon
who
was
driven
back
as
far
as
sedan
and
finally
sedan
sedan
ah
the
horrible
awakening
the
month
of
august
had
finished
the
night
before
amidst
a
tumult
of
weapons
and
dying
groans
but
the
groans
of
the
dying
men
were
mingled
still
with
hopeful
cries
but
the
month
of
september
was
cursed
from
its
very
birth
its
first
was
stifled
back
by
the
brutal
and
cowardly
hand
of
destiny
a
hundred
thousand
men
a
hundred
thousand
frenchmen
compelled
to
capitulate
and
the
emperor
of
france
forced
to
hand
his
sword
over
to
the
king
of
prussia
ah
that
cry
of
grief
that
cry
of
rage
uttered
by
the
whole
nation
it
can
never
be
forgotten
on
september
towards
ten
claude
my
knocked
at
my
door
i
was
not
asleep
and
he
gave
me
a
copy
of
the
first
telegrams
of
sedan
commenced
macmahon
wounded
go
back
again
i
said
as
soon
as
a
fresh
telegram
comes
bring
me
the
news
i
feel
that
something
unheard
of
something
great
and
quite
different
is
going
to
happen
we
have
suffered
so
terribly
this
last
month
that
there
can
only
be
something
good
now
something
fine
for
scales
mete
out
joy
and
suffering
equally
go
at
once
claude
i
added
and
then
full
of
confidence
i
soon
fell
asleep
again
and
was
so
tired
that
i
slept
until
one
when
i
awoke
my
maid
félicie
the
most
delightful
girl
imaginable
was
seated
near
my
bed
her
pretty
face
and
her
large
dark
eyes
were
so
mournful
that
my
heart
stopped
beating
i
gazed
at
her
anxiously
and
she
put
into
my
hands
the
copy
of
the
last
telegram
emperor
napoleon
has
just
handed
over
his
sword
blood
rushed
to
my
head
and
my
lungs
were
too
weak
to
control
its
flow
i
lay
back
on
my
pillow
and
the
blood
escaped
through
my
lips
with
the
groans
of
my
whole
being
for
three
days
i
was
between
life
and
death
leudet
sent
for
one
of
my
friends
a
shipowner
named
maunoir
he
came
at
once
bringing
with
him
his
young
wife
she
too
was
very
ill
worse
in
reality
than
i
was
in
spite
of
her
fresh
look
for
she
died
six
months
later
thanks
to
their
care
and
to
the
energetic
treatment
of
leudet
i
came
through
alive
from
this
attack
i
decided
to
return
at
once
to
paris
as
the
siege
was
about
to
be
proclaimed
and
i
did
not
want
my
mother
and
my
sisters
to
remain
in
the
capital
independently
of
this
every
one
at
was
seized
with
a
desire
to
get
away
invalids
and
tourists
alike
a
was
found
the
owner
of
which
agreed
for
an
exorbitant
price
to
drive
me
to
the
nearest
station
without
delay
when
once
in
it
we
were
more
or
less
comfortably
seated
as
far
as
bordeaux
but
it
was
impossible
to
find
five
seats
in
the
express
from
there
my
was
allowed
to
travel
with
the
i
do
not
know
where
madame
guérard
and
my
maid
found
room
but
in
the
compartment
i
entered
with
my
little
boy
there
were
already
nine
persons
an
ugly
old
man
tried
to
push
my
child
out
when
i
had
put
him
in
but
i
pushed
him
back
again
energetically
in
my
turn
human
force
will
make
us
get
out
of
this
carriage
i
said
you
hear
that
you
ugly
old
man
we
are
here
and
we
shall
a
stout
lady
who
took
up
more
room
herself
than
three
ordinary
persons
exclaimed
that
is
lively
for
we
are
suffocated
already
shameful
to
let
eleven
persons
get
into
a
compartment
where
there
are
only
seats
for
eight
you
get
out
then
i
retorted
turning
to
her
quickly
without
you
there
would
only
be
seven
of
the
stifled
laughter
of
the
other
travellers
showed
me
that
i
had
won
over
my
audience
three
young
men
offered
me
their
places
but
i
refused
declaring
that
i
was
going
to
stand
the
three
young
men
had
risen
and
they
declared
that
they
would
also
stand
the
stout
lady
called
a
railway
official
here
please
she
began
the
official
stopped
an
instant
at
the
door
is
perfectly
shameful
she
went
on
are
eleven
in
this
compartment
and
it
is
impossible
to
you
believe
it
exclaimed
one
of
the
young
men
look
for
yourself
we
are
standing
up
and
there
are
three
seats
empty
send
some
more
people
in
the
official
went
away
laughing
and
muttering
something
about
the
woman
who
had
complained
she
turned
to
the
young
man
and
began
to
talk
abusively
to
him
he
bowed
very
respectfully
in
reply
and
said
if
you
will
calm
down
you
shall
be
satisfied
we
will
seat
seven
on
the
other
side
including
the
child
and
then
you
will
only
be
four
on
your
the
ugly
old
man
was
short
and
slight
he
looked
sideways
at
the
stout
lady
and
murmured
four
his
look
and
tone
showed
that
he
considered
the
stout
lady
took
up
more
than
one
seat
this
look
and
tone
were
not
lost
on
the
young
man
and
before
the
ugly
old
man
had
comprehended
he
said
to
him
you
come
over
here
and
have
this
corner
all
the
thin
people
will
be
together
then
he
added
inviting
a
placid
young
englishman
of
eighteen
to
twenty
years
of
age
to
take
the
old
seat
the
englishman
had
the
torso
of
a
with
a
face
like
that
of
a
baby
a
very
young
woman
opposite
the
stout
one
laughed
till
the
tears
came
all
six
of
us
then
found
room
on
the
thin
side
of
the
carriage
we
were
a
little
crushed
but
had
been
considerably
enlivened
by
this
little
entertainment
and
we
certainly
needed
something
to
enliven
us
the
young
man
who
had
taken
the
matter
in
hand
in
such
a
witty
way
was
tall
and
he
had
blue
eyes
and
his
hair
was
almost
white
and
this
gave
to
his
face
a
most
attractive
freshness
and
youthfulness
my
boy
was
on
his
knee
during
the
night
with
the
exception
of
the
child
the
stout
lady
and
the
young
englishman
no
one
went
to
sleep
the
heat
was
overpowering
and
the
war
was
of
course
discussed
after
some
hesitation
one
of
the
young
men
told
me
that
i
resembled
mlle
sarah
bernhardt
i
answered
that
there
was
every
reason
why
i
should
resemble
her
the
young
men
then
introduced
themselves
the
one
who
had
recognised
me
was
albert
delpit
the
second
was
a
dutchman
baron
van
zelern
or
von
zerlen
i
do
not
remember
exactly
which
and
the
young
man
with
white
hair
was
félix
faure
he
told
me
that
he
was
from
hâvre
and
that
he
knew
my
grandmother
very
well
i
kept
up
a
certain
friendship
with
these
three
men
afterwards
but
later
on
albert
delpit
became
my
enemy
all
three
are
now
dead
albert
delpit
died
a
disappointed
man
for
he
had
tried
everything
and
succeeded
in
nothing
the
dutch
baron
was
killed
in
a
railway
accident
and
félix
faure
was
president
of
the
french
republic
the
young
woman
on
hearing
my
name
introduced
herself
in
her
turn
think
we
are
slightly
related
she
said
am
madame
bordeaux
i
asked
my
brother
had
married
a
mlle
laroque
of
bordeaux
so
that
we
were
able
to
talk
of
our
family
altogether
the
journey
did
not
seem
very
long
in
spite
of
the
heat
the
and
our
thirst
the
arrival
in
paris
was
more
gloomy
we
shook
hands
warmly
with
each
other
the
stout
husband
was
awaiting
her
he
handed
her
in
silence
a
telegram
the
unfortunate
woman
read
it
and
then
uttering
a
cry
burst
into
sobs
and
fell
into
his
arms
i
gazed
at
her
wondering
what
sorrow
had
come
upon
her
poor
woman
i
could
no
longer
see
anything
ridiculous
about
her
i
felt
a
pang
of
remorse
at
the
thought
that
we
had
been
laughing
at
her
so
much
when
misfortune
had
already
singled
her
out
on
reaching
home
i
sent
word
to
my
mother
that
i
should
be
with
her
some
time
during
the
day
she
came
at
once
as
she
wanted
to
know
how
my
health
was
we
then
arranged
about
the
departure
of
the
whole
family
with
the
exception
of
myself
as
i
wanted
to
stay
in
paris
during
the
siege
my
mother
my
little
boy
and
his
nurse
my
sisters
my
aunt
annette
who
kept
house
for
me
and
my
maid
were
all
ready
to
start
two
days
later
i
had
taken
rooms
at
at
hâvre
for
the
whole
tribe
but
the
desire
to
leave
paris
was
one
thing
and
the
possibility
of
doing
so
another
the
stations
were
invaded
by
families
like
mine
who
thought
it
more
prudent
to
emigrate
i
sent
my
to
engage
a
compartment
and
he
came
back
three
hours
later
with
his
clothes
torn
after
receiving
no
end
of
kicks
and
blows
can
not
go
into
that
crowd
he
assured
me
is
quite
impossible
i
should
not
be
able
to
protect
her
besides
madame
will
not
be
alone
there
is
mother
the
other
ladies
and
the
children
it
is
really
quite
i
sent
at
once
for
three
of
my
friends
explained
my
difficulty
and
asked
them
to
accompany
me
i
told
my
steward
to
be
ready
as
well
as
my
other
and
my
footman
he
in
his
turn
invited
his
younger
brother
who
was
a
priest
and
who
was
very
willing
to
go
with
us
we
all
set
off
in
a
railway
omnibus
there
were
seventeen
of
us
in
all
but
only
nine
who
were
really
travelling
our
eight
protectors
were
none
too
many
for
those
who
were
taking
tickets
were
not
human
beings
but
wild
beasts
haunted
by
fear
and
spurred
on
by
a
desire
to
escape
these
brutes
saw
nothing
but
the
little
ticket
office
the
door
leading
to
the
train
and
then
the
train
which
would
ensure
their
escape
the
presence
of
the
young
priest
was
a
great
help
to
us
for
his
religious
character
made
people
refrain
sometimes
from
blows
when
once
all
my
people
were
installed
in
the
compartment
which
had
been
reserved
for
them
they
waved
their
farewells
threw
kisses
and
the
train
started
a
shudder
of
terror
ran
through
me
for
i
suddenly
felt
so
absolutely
alone
it
was
the
first
time
i
had
been
separated
from
the
little
child
who
was
dearer
to
me
than
the
whole
world
two
arms
were
then
thrown
affectionately
round
me
and
a
voice
murmured
dear
sarah
why
did
you
not
go
too
you
are
so
delicate
will
you
be
able
to
bear
the
solitude
without
the
dear
child
it
was
madame
guérard
who
had
arrived
too
late
to
kiss
the
boy
but
was
there
now
to
comfort
the
mother
i
gave
way
to
my
despair
regretting
that
i
had
let
him
go
away
and
yet
as
i
said
to
myself
there
might
be
fighting
in
paris
the
idea
never
for
an
instant
occurred
to
me
that
i
might
have
gone
away
with
him
i
thought
that
i
might
be
of
some
use
in
paris
of
some
use
but
in
what
way
this
i
did
not
know
the
idea
seemed
stupid
but
nevertheless
that
was
my
idea
it
seemed
to
me
that
every
one
who
was
fit
ought
to
remain
in
paris
in
spite
of
my
weakness
i
felt
that
i
was
fit
and
with
reason
as
i
proved
later
on
i
therefore
remained
not
knowing
at
all
what
i
was
going
to
do
for
some
days
i
was
perfectly
dazed
missing
the
life
around
me
and
missing
the
affection
xvi
sarah
ambulance
at
the
odéon
theatre
the
defence
however
was
being
organised
and
i
decided
to
use
my
strength
and
intelligence
in
tending
the
wounded
the
question
was
where
could
we
instal
an
ambulance
the
odéon
theatre
had
closed
its
doors
but
i
moved
heaven
and
earth
to
get
permission
to
organise
an
ambulance
in
that
theatre
and
thanks
to
emile
de
girardin
and
duquesnel
my
wish
was
gratified
i
went
to
the
war
office
and
made
my
declaration
and
my
request
and
my
offers
were
accepted
for
a
military
ambulance
the
next
difficulty
was
that
i
wanted
food
i
wrote
a
line
to
the
prefect
of
police
a
military
courier
arrived
very
soon
with
a
note
from
the
prefect
containing
the
following
lines
if
you
could
possibly
come
at
once
i
would
wait
for
you
until
six
if
not
i
will
receive
you
morning
at
eight
excuse
the
earliness
of
the
hour
but
i
have
to
be
at
the
chamber
at
nine
in
the
morning
and
as
your
note
seems
to
be
urgent
i
am
anxious
to
do
all
i
can
to
be
of
service
to
you
de
i
remembered
a
comte
de
kératry
who
had
been
introduced
to
me
at
my
house
the
evening
i
had
recited
poetry
accompanied
by
rossini
but
he
was
a
young
lieutenant
witty
and
lively
he
had
introduced
me
to
his
mother
i
had
recited
poetry
at
her
the
young
lieutenant
had
gone
to
mexico
and
for
some
time
we
had
kept
up
a
correspondence
but
this
had
gradually
ceased
and
we
had
not
met
again
i
asked
madame
guérard
whether
she
thought
that
the
prefect
were
a
near
relative
of
my
young
may
be
so
she
replied
and
we
discussed
this
in
the
carriage
which
was
taking
us
at
once
to
the
tuileries
palace
where
the
prefect
had
his
offices
my
heart
was
very
heavy
when
we
came
to
the
stone
steps
only
a
few
months
previously
one
april
morning
i
had
been
there
with
madame
guérard
then
as
now
a
footman
had
come
forward
to
open
the
door
of
my
carriage
but
the
april
sunshine
had
then
lighted
up
the
steps
caught
the
shining
lamps
of
the
state
carriages
and
sent
its
rays
in
all
directions
there
had
been
a
busy
joyful
coming
and
going
of
the
officers
then
and
elegant
salutes
had
been
exchanged
on
this
occasion
the
misty
november
sun
fell
heavily
on
all
it
touched
black
cabs
drove
up
one
after
the
other
knocking
against
the
iron
gate
grazing
the
steps
advancing
or
moving
back
according
to
the
coarse
shouts
of
their
drivers
instead
of
the
elegant
salutations
i
heard
now
such
phrases
as
how
are
you
old
chap
gueule
de
any
news
the
very
deuce
with
us
the
palace
was
no
longer
the
same
the
very
atmosphere
had
changed
the
faint
perfume
which
elegant
women
leave
in
the
air
as
they
pass
was
no
longer
there
a
vague
odour
of
tobacco
of
greasy
clothes
of
dirty
hair
made
the
atmosphere
seem
heavy
ah
the
beautiful
french
empress
i
could
see
her
again
in
her
blue
dress
embroidered
with
silver
calling
to
her
aid
good
fairy
to
help
her
on
again
with
her
little
slipper
the
delightful
young
prince
imperial
too
i
could
see
him
helping
me
to
arrange
the
pots
of
verbena
and
marguerites
and
holding
in
his
arms
which
were
not
strong
enough
for
it
a
huge
pot
of
rhododendrons
behind
which
his
handsome
face
completely
disappeared
then
too
i
could
see
the
emperor
napoleon
iii
with
his
eyes
clapping
his
hands
at
the
rehearsal
of
the
curtseys
intended
for
him
and
the
fair
empress
dressed
in
strange
clothes
had
rushed
away
in
the
carriage
of
her
american
dentist
for
it
was
not
even
a
frenchman
but
a
foreigner
who
had
had
the
courage
to
protect
the
unfortunate
woman
and
the
gentle
utopian
emperor
had
tried
in
vain
to
be
killed
on
the
two
horses
had
been
killed
under
him
and
he
had
not
received
so
much
as
a
scratch
and
after
this
he
had
given
up
his
sword
and
we
at
home
had
all
wept
with
anger
shame
and
grief
at
this
giving
up
of
the
sword
and
yet
what
courage
it
must
have
required
for
so
brave
a
man
to
carry
out
such
an
act
he
had
wanted
to
save
a
hundred
thousand
men
to
spare
a
hundred
thousand
lives
and
to
reassure
a
hundred
thousand
mothers
our
poor
beloved
emperor
history
will
some
day
do
him
justice
for
he
was
good
humane
and
confiding
alas
alas
he
was
too
confiding
i
stopped
a
minute
before
entering
the
suite
of
rooms
i
was
obliged
to
wipe
my
eyes
and
in
order
to
change
the
current
of
my
thoughts
i
said
to
petit
me
should
you
think
me
pretty
if
you
saw
me
now
for
the
first
time
yes
she
replied
warmly
much
the
better
i
said
i
want
this
old
prefect
to
think
me
pretty
there
are
so
many
things
i
must
ask
him
for
on
entering
his
room
my
surprise
was
great
when
i
recognised
in
him
the
lieutenant
i
knew
he
had
become
captain
and
then
prefect
of
police
when
my
name
was
announced
by
the
usher
he
sprang
up
from
his
chair
and
came
forward
with
his
face
beaming
and
both
hands
stretched
out
you
had
forgotten
me
he
said
and
then
he
turned
to
greet
madame
guérard
in
a
friendly
way
i
never
thought
i
was
coming
to
see
you
i
replied
i
am
delighted
i
continued
you
will
let
me
have
everything
i
ask
that
he
remarked
with
a
burst
of
laughter
will
you
give
your
orders
madame
he
continued
i
want
bread
milk
meat
vegetables
sugar
wine
brandy
potatoes
eggs
coffee
i
said
straight
away
let
me
get
my
breath
exclaimed
the
speak
so
quickly
that
i
am
i
was
quiet
for
a
moment
and
then
i
continued
have
started
an
ambulance
at
the
odéon
but
as
it
is
a
military
ambulance
the
municipal
authorities
refuse
me
food
i
have
five
wounded
men
already
and
i
can
manage
for
them
but
other
wounded
men
are
being
sent
to
me
and
i
shall
have
to
give
them
shall
be
supplied
above
and
beyond
all
your
wishes
said
the
prefect
is
food
in
the
palace
which
was
being
stored
by
the
unfortunate
empress
she
had
prepared
enough
for
months
and
months
i
will
have
all
you
want
sent
to
you
except
meat
bread
and
milk
and
as
regards
these
i
will
give
orders
that
your
ambulance
shall
be
included
in
the
municipal
service
although
it
is
a
military
one
then
i
will
give
you
an
order
for
salt
and
other
things
which
you
will
be
able
to
get
from
the
the
opéra
i
repeated
looking
at
him
incredulously
it
is
only
being
built
and
there
is
nothing
but
scaffolding
there
but
you
must
go
through
the
little
doorway
under
the
scaffolding
opposite
the
rue
scribe
you
then
go
up
the
little
spiral
staircase
leading
to
the
provision
office
and
there
you
will
be
supplied
with
what
you
is
still
something
else
i
want
to
ask
i
said
on
i
am
quite
resigned
and
ready
for
your
orders
he
replied
i
am
very
uneasy
i
said
they
have
put
a
stock
of
powder
in
the
cellars
under
the
odéon
if
paris
were
to
be
bombarded
and
a
shell
should
fall
on
the
building
we
should
all
be
blown
up
and
that
is
not
the
aim
and
object
of
an
are
quite
right
said
the
kind
man
nothing
could
be
more
stupid
than
to
store
powder
there
i
shall
have
more
difficulty
about
that
though
he
continued
i
shall
have
to
deal
with
a
crowd
of
stubborn
who
want
to
organise
the
defence
in
their
own
way
you
must
try
to
get
a
petition
for
me
signed
by
the
most
influential
householders
and
tradespeople
in
the
neighbourhood
now
are
you
satisfied
he
asked
i
replied
shaking
both
his
hands
cordially
have
been
most
kind
and
charming
thank
you
very
i
then
moved
towards
the
door
but
i
stood
still
again
suddenly
as
though
hypnotised
by
an
overcoat
hanging
over
a
chair
madame
guérard
saw
what
had
attracted
my
attention
and
she
pulled
my
sleeve
gently
dear
sarah
she
whispered
not
do
i
looked
beseechingly
at
the
young
prefect
but
he
did
not
understand
can
i
do
now
to
oblige
you
beautiful
madonna
he
asked
i
pointed
to
the
coat
and
tried
to
look
as
charming
as
possible
am
very
sorry
he
said
bewildered
i
do
not
understand
at
i
was
still
pointing
to
the
coat
it
me
will
you
i
said
overcoat
do
you
want
it
for
my
wounded
men
when
they
are
he
sank
down
on
a
chair
in
a
fit
of
laughter
i
was
rather
vexed
at
this
uncontrollable
outburst
and
i
continued
my
explanation
is
nothing
so
funny
about
it
i
said
have
a
poor
fellow
for
instance
two
of
whose
fingers
have
been
taken
off
he
does
not
need
to
stay
in
bed
for
that
naturally
and
his
cape
is
not
warm
enough
it
is
very
difficult
to
warm
the
big
of
the
odéon
sufficiently
and
those
who
are
well
enough
have
to
be
there
the
man
i
tell
you
about
is
warm
enough
at
present
because
i
took
henri
overcoat
when
he
came
to
see
me
the
other
day
my
poor
soldier
is
huge
and
as
henri
fould
is
a
giant
i
might
never
have
had
such
an
opportunity
again
i
shall
want
a
great
many
overcoats
though
and
this
looks
like
a
very
warm
i
stroked
the
furry
lining
of
the
coveted
garment
and
the
young
prefect
still
choking
with
laughter
began
to
empty
the
pockets
of
his
overcoat
he
pulled
out
a
magnificent
white
silk
muffler
from
the
largest
pocket
you
allow
me
to
keep
my
muffler
he
asked
i
put
on
a
resigned
expression
and
nodded
my
consent
our
host
then
rang
and
when
the
usher
appeared
he
handed
him
the
overcoat
and
said
in
a
solemn
voice
in
spite
of
the
laughter
in
his
eyes
you
carry
this
to
the
carriage
for
these
ladies
i
thanked
him
again
and
went
away
feeling
very
happy
twelve
days
later
i
returned
taking
with
me
a
letter
covered
with
the
signatures
of
the
householders
and
tradesmen
residing
near
the
odéon
on
entering
the
room
i
was
petrified
to
see
him
instead
of
advancing
to
meet
me
rush
towards
a
cupboard
open
the
door
and
fling
something
hastily
into
it
after
this
he
leaned
against
the
door
as
though
to
prevent
my
opening
it
me
he
said
in
a
witty
mocking
tone
i
caught
a
violent
cold
after
your
first
visit
i
have
just
put
my
overcoat
oh
only
an
ugly
old
overcoat
not
a
warm
one
he
added
quickly
still
an
overcoat
inside
there
and
there
it
now
is
and
i
will
take
the
key
out
of
the
he
put
the
key
carefully
into
his
pocket
and
then
came
forward
and
offered
me
a
chair
but
our
conversation
soon
took
a
more
serious
turn
for
the
news
was
very
bad
for
the
last
twelve
days
the
ambulances
had
been
crowded
with
wounded
men
everything
was
in
a
bad
way
home
politics
as
well
as
foreign
politics
the
germans
were
advancing
on
paris
the
army
of
the
loire
was
being
formed
gambetta
chanzy
bourbaki
and
trochu
were
organising
a
desperate
defence
we
talked
for
some
time
about
all
these
sad
things
and
i
told
him
about
the
painful
impression
i
had
had
on
my
last
visit
to
the
tuileries
of
my
remembrance
of
every
one
so
brilliant
so
considerate
and
so
happy
formerly
and
so
deeply
to
be
pitied
at
present
we
were
silent
for
a
moment
and
then
i
shook
hands
with
him
told
him
i
had
received
all
he
had
sent
and
returned
to
my
ambulance
the
prefect
had
sent
me
ten
barrels
of
wine
and
two
of
brandy
eggs
all
packed
in
boxes
with
lime
and
bran
a
hundred
bags
of
coffee
and
boxes
of
tea
forty
boxes
of
albert
biscuits
a
thousand
tins
of
preserves
and
a
quantity
of
other
things
menier
the
great
chocolate
manufacturer
had
sent
me
five
hundred
pounds
of
chocolate
one
of
my
friends
a
flour
dealer
had
made
me
a
present
of
twenty
sacks
of
flour
ten
of
which
were
maize
flour
this
was
the
one
who
had
asked
me
to
be
his
wife
when
i
was
at
the
conservatoire
félix
potin
my
neighbour
when
i
was
living
at
boulevard
malesherbes
had
responded
to
my
appeal
by
sending
two
barrels
of
raisins
a
hundred
boxes
of
sardines
three
sacks
of
rice
two
sacks
of
lentils
and
twenty
from
de
rothschild
i
had
received
two
barrels
of
brandy
and
a
hundred
bottles
of
his
own
wine
for
the
convalescents
i
also
received
a
very
unexpected
present
léonie
dubourg
an
old
of
mine
at
the
convent
sent
me
fifty
tin
boxes
each
containing
four
pounds
of
salt
butter
she
had
married
a
very
wealthy
gentleman
farmer
who
cultivated
his
own
farms
which
it
seems
were
very
numerous
i
was
very
much
touched
at
her
remembering
me
for
i
had
never
seen
her
since
the
old
days
at
the
convent
i
had
also
asked
for
all
the
overcoats
and
slippers
of
my
various
friends
and
i
had
bought
up
a
job
lot
of
two
hundred
flannel
vests
my
aunt
betsy
my
blind
sister
who
is
still
living
in
holland
and
is
now
years
of
age
managed
to
get
for
me
through
the
charming
ambassador
for
the
netherlands
three
hundred
of
magnificent
dutch
linen
and
a
hundred
pairs
of
sheets
i
received
lint
and
bandages
from
every
corner
of
paris
but
it
was
more
particularly
from
the
palais
de
that
i
used
to
get
my
provisions
of
lint
and
of
linen
for
binding
wounds
there
was
an
adorable
woman
there
named
mlle
hocquigny
who
was
at
the
head
of
all
the
ambulances
all
that
she
did
was
done
with
a
cheerful
gracefulness
and
all
that
she
was
obliged
to
refuse
she
refused
sorrowfully
but
still
in
a
gracious
manner
she
was
at
that
time
over
thirty
years
of
age
and
although
unmarried
she
looked
more
like
a
very
young
married
woman
she
had
large
blue
dreamy
eyes
and
a
laughing
mouth
a
deliciously
oval
face
little
dimples
and
crowning
all
this
grace
this
dreamy
expression
and
this
coquettish
inviting
mouth
a
wide
forehead
like
that
of
the
virgins
painted
by
the
early
painters
rather
prominent
encircled
by
hair
worn
in
smooth
wide
flat
bandeaux
separated
by
a
faultless
parting
the
forehead
seemed
like
the
protecting
rampart
of
this
delicious
face
mlle
hocquigny
was
adored
and
made
much
of
by
every
one
but
she
remained
invulnerable
to
all
homage
she
was
happy
in
being
beloved
but
she
would
not
allow
any
one
to
express
affection
for
her
at
the
palais
de
a
remarkable
number
of
celebrated
doctors
and
surgeons
were
on
duty
and
they
as
well
as
the
convalescents
were
all
more
or
less
in
love
with
mlle
hocquigny
as
she
and
i
were
great
friends
she
confided
to
me
her
observations
and
her
sorrowful
disdain
thanks
to
her
i
was
never
short
of
linen
nor
of
lint
i
had
organised
my
ambulance
with
a
very
small
staff
my
cook
was
installed
in
the
public
i
had
bought
her
an
immense
cooking
range
so
that
she
could
make
soups
and
for
fifty
men
her
husband
was
chief
attendant
i
had
given
him
two
assistants
and
madame
guérard
madame
lambquin
and
i
were
the
nurses
two
of
us
sat
up
at
night
so
that
we
each
went
to
bed
one
night
in
three
i
preferred
this
to
taking
on
some
woman
whom
i
did
not
know
madame
lambquin
belonged
to
the
odéon
where
she
used
to
take
the
part
of
the
duennas
she
was
plain
and
had
a
common
face
but
she
was
very
talented
she
talked
loud
and
was
very
she
called
a
spade
a
spade
and
liked
frankness
and
no
under
meaning
to
things
at
times
she
was
a
trifle
embarrassing
with
the
crudeness
of
her
words
and
her
remarks
but
she
was
kind
active
alert
and
devoted
my
various
friends
who
were
on
service
at
the
fortifications
came
to
me
in
their
free
time
to
do
my
secretarial
work
i
had
to
keep
a
book
which
was
shown
every
day
to
a
sergeant
who
came
from
the
military
hospital
giving
all
details
as
to
how
many
men
came
into
our
ambulance
how
many
died
and
how
many
recovered
and
left
paris
was
in
a
state
of
siege
no
one
could
go
far
outside
the
walls
and
no
news
from
outside
could
be
received
the
germans
were
not
however
round
the
gates
of
the
city
baron
larrey
came
now
and
then
to
see
me
and
i
had
as
head
surgeon
duchesne
who
gave
up
his
whole
time
night
and
day
to
the
care
of
my
poor
men
during
the
five
months
that
this
truly
frightful
nightmare
lasted
i
can
not
recall
those
terrible
days
without
the
deepest
emotion
it
was
no
longer
the
country
in
danger
that
kept
my
nerves
strung
up
but
the
sufferings
of
all
her
children
there
were
all
those
who
were
away
fighting
those
who
were
brought
in
to
us
wounded
or
dying
the
noble
women
of
the
people
who
stood
for
hours
and
hours
in
the
to
get
the
necessary
dole
of
bread
meat
and
milk
for
their
poor
little
ones
at
home
ah
those
poor
women
i
could
see
them
from
the
theatre
windows
pressing
up
close
to
each
other
blue
with
cold
and
stamping
their
feet
on
the
ground
to
keep
them
from
freezing
for
that
winter
was
the
most
cruel
one
we
had
had
for
twenty
years
frequently
one
of
these
poor
silent
heroines
was
brought
in
to
me
either
in
a
swoon
from
fatigue
or
struck
down
suddenly
with
congestion
caused
by
cold
on
december
three
of
these
unfortunate
women
were
brought
into
the
ambulance
one
of
them
had
her
feet
frozen
and
she
lost
the
big
toe
of
her
right
foot
the
second
was
an
enormously
stout
woman
who
was
suckling
her
child
and
her
poor
breasts
were
harder
than
wood
she
simply
howled
with
pain
the
youngest
of
the
three
was
a
girl
of
sixteen
to
eighteen
years
of
age
she
died
of
cold
on
the
trestle
on
which
i
had
had
her
placed
to
send
her
home
on
december
there
were
fifteen
degrees
of
cold
i
often
sent
guillaume
our
attendant
out
with
a
little
brandy
to
warm
the
poor
women
oh
the
suffering
they
must
have
endured
those
mothers
those
sisters
and
in
their
terrible
dread
how
excusable
their
rebellion
seems
during
the
commune
and
even
their
bloodthirsty
madness
my
ambulance
was
full
i
had
sixty
beds
and
was
obliged
to
improvise
ten
more
the
soldiers
were
installed
in
the
and
in
the
general
and
the
officers
in
a
room
which
had
been
formerly
the
of
the
theatre
one
day
a
young
breton
named
marie
le
gallec
was
brought
in
he
had
been
struck
by
a
bullet
in
the
chest
and
another
in
the
wrist
duchesne
bound
up
his
chest
firmly
and
attended
to
his
wrist
he
then
said
to
me
very
simply
him
have
anything
he
likes
he
is
i
bent
over
his
bed
and
said
to
him
me
what
would
give
you
pleasure
marie
le
he
answered
promptly
in
the
most
comic
way
madame
guérard
hurried
away
to
the
kitchen
and
soon
returned
with
a
bowl
of
broth
and
pieces
of
toast
i
placed
the
bowl
on
the
little
wooden
shelf
which
was
so
convenient
for
the
meals
of
our
poor
sufferers
the
wounded
man
looked
up
at
me
and
said
i
did
not
understand
and
he
repeated
his
poor
chest
caused
him
to
hiss
out
the
word
and
he
made
the
greatest
efforts
to
repeat
his
emphatic
request
i
sent
immediately
to
the
marine
office
thinking
that
there
would
surely
be
some
breton
seamen
there
and
i
explained
my
difficulty
and
my
ignorance
of
the
breton
dialect
i
was
informed
that
the
word
meant
bread
i
hurried
at
once
to
le
gallec
with
a
large
piece
of
bread
his
face
lighted
up
and
taking
it
from
me
with
his
sound
hand
he
broke
it
up
with
his
teeth
and
let
the
pieces
fall
in
the
bowl
he
then
plunged
his
spoon
into
the
middle
of
the
broth
and
filled
it
up
with
bread
until
the
spoon
could
stand
upright
in
it
when
it
stood
up
without
shaking
about
the
young
soldier
smiled
he
was
just
preparing
to
eat
this
horrible
concoction
when
the
young
priest
from
sulpice
who
had
my
ambulance
in
charge
arrived
i
had
sent
for
him
on
hearing
the
sad
verdict
he
laid
his
hand
gently
on
the
young
shoulder
thus
stopping
the
movement
of
his
arm
the
poor
fellow
looked
up
at
the
priest
who
showed
him
the
holy
cup
he
said
simply
and
then
placing
his
coarse
handkerchief
over
the
steaming
soup
he
put
his
hands
together
we
had
arranged
the
two
screens
which
we
used
for
isolating
the
dead
or
dying
around
his
bed
he
was
left
alone
with
the
priest
whilst
i
went
on
my
rounds
to
calm
those
who
were
chaffing
or
help
the
believers
raise
themselves
for
prayer
the
young
priest
soon
pushed
aside
the
partition
and
i
then
saw
marie
le
gallec
with
a
beaming
face
eating
his
abominable
bread
sop
he
soon
fell
asleep
but
awoke
before
long
and
asked
for
something
to
drink
and
then
died
in
a
slight
fit
of
choking
fortunately
i
did
not
lose
many
men
out
of
the
three
hundred
who
came
into
my
ambulance
for
the
death
of
the
unfortunate
ones
completely
upset
me
i
was
very
young
at
that
time
only
years
of
age
but
i
could
nevertheless
see
the
cowardice
of
some
of
the
men
and
the
heroism
of
many
of
the
others
a
young
savoyard
eighteen
years
old
had
had
his
forefinger
shot
off
baron
larrey
was
quite
sure
that
he
had
done
it
himself
with
his
own
gun
but
i
could
not
believe
that
i
noticed
though
that
in
spite
of
our
nursing
and
care
the
wound
did
not
heal
i
bound
it
up
in
a
different
way
and
the
following
day
i
saw
that
the
bandage
had
been
altered
i
mentioned
this
to
madame
lambquin
who
was
sitting
up
that
night
with
madame
guérard
i
will
keep
my
eye
on
him
you
go
to
sleep
my
child
and
rely
on
the
next
day
when
i
arrived
she
told
me
that
she
had
caught
the
young
man
scraping
the
wound
on
his
finger
with
his
knife
i
called
him
and
told
him
that
i
should
have
to
report
this
to
the
hospital
he
began
to
weep
and
vowed
to
me
that
he
would
never
do
it
again
and
five
days
later
he
was
well
i
signed
the
paper
authorising
him
to
leave
the
ambulance
and
he
was
sent
to
the
army
of
the
defence
i
often
wondered
what
became
of
him
another
of
our
patients
bewildered
us
too
each
time
that
his
wound
seemed
to
be
just
on
the
point
of
healing
up
he
had
a
violent
attack
of
dysentery
which
prevented
him
getting
well
this
seemed
suspicious
to
duchesne
and
he
asked
me
to
watch
the
man
at
the
end
of
a
considerable
time
we
were
convinced
that
our
wounded
man
had
thought
out
the
most
comical
scheme
he
slept
next
the
wall
and
therefore
had
no
neighbour
on
the
one
side
during
the
night
he
managed
to
file
the
brass
of
his
bedstead
he
put
the
filings
in
a
little
pot
which
had
been
used
for
ointment
of
some
kind
a
few
drops
of
water
and
some
salt
mixed
with
this
powdered
brass
formed
a
poison
which
might
have
cost
its
inventor
his
life
i
was
furious
at
this
stratagem
i
wrote
to
the
and
an
ambulance
conveyance
was
sent
to
take
this
unpatriotic
frenchman
away
but
side
by
side
with
these
despicable
men
what
heroism
we
saw
a
young
captain
was
brought
in
one
day
he
was
a
tall
fellow
a
regular
hercules
with
a
superb
head
and
a
frank
expression
on
my
book
he
was
inscribed
as
captain
menesson
he
had
been
struck
by
a
bullet
at
the
top
of
the
arm
just
at
the
shoulder
with
a
assistance
i
was
trying
as
gently
as
possible
to
take
off
his
cloak
when
three
bullets
fell
from
the
hood
which
he
had
pulled
over
his
head
and
i
counted
sixteen
bullet
holes
in
the
cloak
the
young
officer
had
stood
upright
for
three
hours
serving
as
a
target
himself
whilst
covering
the
retreat
of
his
men
as
they
fired
all
the
time
on
the
enemy
this
had
taken
place
among
the
champigny
vines
he
had
been
brought
in
unconscious
in
an
ambulance
conveyance
he
had
lost
a
great
deal
of
blood
and
was
half
dead
with
fatigue
and
weakness
he
was
very
gentle
and
charming
and
thought
himself
sufficiently
well
two
days
later
to
return
to
the
fight
the
doctor
however
would
not
allow
this
and
his
sister
who
was
a
nun
besought
him
to
wait
until
he
was
something
like
well
again
not
quite
well
she
said
smiling
just
well
enough
to
have
strength
to
soon
after
he
came
into
the
ambulance
the
cross
of
the
legion
of
honour
was
brought
to
him
and
this
was
a
moment
of
intense
emotion
for
every
one
the
unfortunate
wounded
men
who
could
not
move
turned
their
suffering
faces
towards
him
and
with
their
eyes
shining
through
a
mist
of
tears
gave
him
a
fraternal
look
the
stronger
amongst
them
held
out
their
hands
to
the
young
giant
it
was
and
i
had
decorated
the
ambulance
with
festoons
of
green
leaves
i
had
made
pretty
little
chapels
in
front
of
the
virgin
mary
and
the
young
priest
from
sulpice
came
to
take
part
in
our
poor
but
poetical
christmas
service
he
repeated
some
beautiful
prayers
and
the
wounded
men
many
of
whom
were
from
brittany
sang
some
sad
solemn
songs
full
of
charm
porel
the
present
manager
of
the
vaudeville
theatre
had
been
wounded
on
the
avron
plateau
he
was
then
convalescent
and
was
one
of
my
patients
together
with
two
officers
now
ready
to
leave
the
ambulance
that
christmas
supper
is
one
of
my
most
charming
and
at
the
same
time
most
melancholy
memories
it
was
served
in
the
small
room
which
we
had
made
into
a
bedroom
our
three
beds
were
covered
with
draperies
and
skins
which
i
had
had
brought
from
home
and
we
used
them
as
seats
mlle
hocquigny
had
sent
me
five
metres
of
the
famous
christmas
dish
and
all
my
poor
soldiers
who
were
well
enough
were
delighted
with
this
delicacy
one
of
my
friends
had
had
twenty
large
cakes
made
for
me
and
i
had
ordered
some
large
bowls
of
punch
the
coloured
flames
from
which
amused
the
sick
children
immensely
the
young
priest
from
sulpice
accepted
a
piece
of
and
after
taking
a
little
white
wine
left
us
ah
how
charming
and
good
he
was
that
poor
young
priest
and
how
well
he
managed
to
make
fortin
the
insupportable
wounded
fellow
cease
talking
gradually
the
latter
began
to
get
humanised
until
finally
he
began
to
think
the
priest
was
a
good
sort
of
fellow
poor
young
priest
he
was
shot
by
the
communists
i
cried
for
days
and
days
over
the
murder
of
this
young
sulpice
priest
xvii
paris
bombarded
the
month
of
january
arrived
the
army
of
the
enemy
held
paris
day
by
day
in
a
still
closer
grip
food
was
getting
scarce
bitter
cold
enveloped
the
city
and
poor
soldiers
who
fell
sometimes
only
slightly
wounded
passed
away
gently
in
a
sleep
that
was
eternal
their
brain
numbed
and
their
body
half
frozen
no
more
news
could
be
received
from
outside
but
thanks
to
the
united
states
minister
who
had
resolved
to
remain
in
paris
a
letter
arrived
from
time
to
time
it
was
in
this
way
that
i
received
a
thin
slip
of
paper
as
soft
as
a
primrose
petal
bringing
me
the
following
message
one
well
courage
a
thousand
your
this
impalpable
missive
dated
from
seventeen
days
previously
and
so
my
mother
my
sisters
and
my
little
boy
were
at
the
hague
all
this
time
and
my
mind
which
had
been
continually
travelling
in
their
direction
had
been
wandering
along
the
wrong
route
towards
hâvre
where
i
thought
they
were
settled
down
quietly
at
the
house
of
a
cousin
of
my
mother
where
were
they
and
with
whom
i
had
two
aunts
at
the
hague
but
the
question
was
were
they
there
i
no
longer
knew
what
to
think
and
from
that
moment
i
never
ceased
suffering
the
most
anxious
and
torturing
mental
distress
i
was
doing
all
in
my
power
just
then
to
procure
some
wood
for
fires
comte
de
kératry
had
sent
me
a
large
provision
before
his
departure
to
the
provinces
in
a
balloon
on
october
my
stock
was
growing
very
short
and
i
would
not
allow
what
we
had
in
the
cellars
to
be
touched
so
that
in
case
of
an
emergency
we
should
not
be
absolutely
without
any
i
had
all
the
little
footstools
belonging
to
the
theatre
used
for
firewood
all
the
wooden
cases
in
which
the
properties
were
kept
a
good
number
of
old
roman
benches
and
curule
chairs
that
were
stowed
away
under
the
theatre
and
indeed
everything
which
came
to
hand
finally
taking
pity
on
my
despair
pretty
mlle
hocquigny
sent
me
ten
thousand
kilograms
of
wood
and
then
i
took
courage
again
i
had
been
told
about
some
new
system
of
keeping
meat
by
which
the
meat
lost
neither
its
juice
nor
its
nutritive
quality
i
sent
madame
guérard
to
the
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
odéon
where
such
provisions
were
distributed
but
some
brute
answered
her
that
when
i
had
removed
all
the
religious
images
from
my
ambulance
i
should
receive
the
necessary
food
herisson
the
mayor
with
some
functionary
holding
an
influential
post
had
been
to
inspect
my
ambulance
the
important
personage
had
requested
me
to
have
the
beautiful
white
virgins
which
were
on
the
and
tables
taken
away
as
well
as
the
divine
crucified
one
hanging
on
the
wall
of
each
room
in
which
there
were
any
of
the
wounded
i
refused
in
a
somewhat
insolent
and
very
decided
way
to
act
in
accordance
with
the
wish
of
my
visitor
whereupon
the
famous
republican
turned
his
back
on
me
and
gave
orders
that
i
should
be
refused
everything
at
the
i
was
very
determined
however
and
i
moved
heaven
and
earth
until
i
succeeded
in
getting
inscribed
on
the
lists
for
distribution
of
food
in
spite
of
the
orders
of
the
chief
it
is
only
fair
to
say
that
the
mayor
was
a
charming
man
madame
guérard
returned
after
her
third
visit
with
a
child
pushing
a
containing
ten
enormous
bottles
of
the
miraculous
meat
i
received
the
precious
consignment
with
infinite
joy
for
my
men
had
been
almost
without
meat
for
the
last
three
days
and
the
beloved
was
an
almost
necessary
resource
for
the
poor
wounded
fellows
on
all
the
bottles
were
directions
as
to
opening
them
the
meat
soak
so
many
hours
madame
lambquin
madame
guérard
and
i
together
with
all
the
staff
of
the
infirmary
were
soon
grouped
anxiously
and
inquisitively
around
these
glass
receptacles
i
told
the
head
attendant
to
open
the
largest
of
the
bottles
in
which
through
the
thick
glass
we
could
see
an
enormous
piece
of
beef
surrounded
by
thick
water
the
string
fastened
round
the
rough
paper
which
hid
the
cork
was
cut
and
then
just
as
the
man
was
about
to
put
the
corkscrew
in
a
deafening
explosion
was
heard
and
a
rank
odour
filled
the
room
every
one
rushed
away
terrified
i
called
them
all
back
scared
and
disgusted
as
they
were
and
showed
them
the
following
words
on
the
directions
not
be
alarmed
at
the
bad
odour
on
opening
the
courageously
and
with
resignation
we
resumed
our
work
though
we
felt
sick
all
the
time
from
the
abominable
exhalation
i
took
the
beef
out
and
placed
it
on
a
dish
that
had
been
brought
for
the
purpose
five
minutes
later
this
meat
turned
blue
and
then
black
and
the
stench
from
it
was
so
unbearable
that
i
decided
to
throw
it
away
madame
lambquin
was
wiser
though
and
more
reasonable
oh
no
my
dear
girl
she
said
these
times
it
will
not
do
to
throw
meat
away
even
though
it
may
be
rotten
let
us
put
it
in
the
glass
bottle
again
and
send
it
back
to
the
i
followed
her
wise
advice
and
it
was
a
very
good
thing
i
did
for
another
ambulance
installed
at
boulevard
medicis
on
opening
these
bottles
of
meat
had
been
as
horrified
as
we
were
and
had
thrown
the
contents
into
the
street
a
few
minutes
after
the
crowd
had
gathered
round
in
a
mob
and
refusing
to
listen
to
anything
had
yelled
out
insults
addressed
to
aristocrats
clericals
and
traitors
who
were
throwing
good
meat
intended
for
the
sick
into
the
street
so
that
the
dogs
were
enjoying
it
while
the
people
were
starving
with
hunger
it
was
with
the
greatest
difficulty
that
the
wretched
mad
people
had
been
prevented
from
invading
the
ambulance
and
when
one
of
the
unfortunate
nurses
had
gone
out
later
on
she
had
been
mobbed
and
beaten
until
she
was
left
half
dead
from
fright
and
blows
she
did
not
want
to
be
carried
back
to
her
own
ambulance
and
the
druggist
begged
me
to
take
her
in
i
kept
her
for
a
few
days
in
one
of
the
upper
tier
boxes
of
the
theatre
and
when
she
was
better
she
asked
if
she
might
stay
with
me
as
a
nurse
i
granted
her
wish
and
kept
her
with
me
afterwards
as
a
maid
she
was
a
girl
gentle
and
timid
and
was
for
misfortune
she
was
found
dead
in
the
père
lachaise
cemetery
after
the
skirmish
between
the
communists
and
the
versailles
troop
a
stray
bullet
struck
her
in
the
back
of
the
neck
as
she
was
praying
at
the
grave
of
her
little
sister
who
had
died
two
days
before
from
i
had
taken
her
with
me
to
germain
where
i
had
gone
to
stay
during
the
horrors
of
the
commune
poor
girl
i
had
allowed
her
to
go
to
paris
very
much
against
my
own
will
as
we
could
not
count
on
this
preserved
meat
for
our
food
i
made
a
contract
with
a
knacker
who
agreed
to
supply
me
at
rather
a
high
price
with
horse
flesh
and
until
the
end
this
was
the
only
meat
we
had
to
eat
well
prepared
and
well
seasoned
it
was
very
good
hope
had
now
fled
from
all
hearts
and
we
were
living
in
the
expectation
of
we
knew
not
what
an
atmosphere
of
misfortune
seemed
to
hang
like
lead
over
us
and
it
was
a
sort
of
relief
when
the
bombardment
commenced
on
december
at
last
we
felt
that
something
new
was
happening
it
was
an
era
of
fresh
suffering
there
was
some
stir
at
any
rate
for
the
last
fortnight
the
fact
of
not
knowing
anything
had
been
killing
us
on
january
we
lifted
our
glasses
to
the
health
of
the
absent
ones
to
the
repose
of
the
dead
and
the
toast
choked
us
with
such
a
lump
in
our
throats
every
night
we
used
to
hear
the
dismal
cry
of
ambulance
underneath
the
windows
of
the
odéon
we
went
down
to
meet
the
pitiful
procession
and
one
two
or
sometimes
three
conveyances
would
be
there
full
of
our
poor
wounded
soldiers
there
would
be
ten
or
twelve
rows
of
them
lying
or
sitting
up
on
the
straw
i
said
that
i
had
room
for
one
or
two
and
lifting
the
lantern
i
looked
into
the
conveyance
and
the
faces
would
then
turn
slowly
towards
the
lamp
some
of
the
men
would
close
their
eyes
as
they
were
too
weak
to
bear
even
that
feeble
light
with
the
help
of
the
sergeant
who
accompanied
the
conveyance
and
our
attendant
one
of
the
unfortunates
would
with
difficulty
be
lifted
into
the
narrow
litter
on
which
he
was
to
be
carried
up
to
the
ambulance
oh
what
sorrowful
anguish
it
was
for
me
when
on
lifting
the
head
i
discovered
that
it
was
getting
heavy
oh
so
heavy
and
when
bending
over
that
inert
face
i
felt
that
there
was
no
longer
any
breath
the
sergeant
would
then
give
the
order
to
take
him
back
and
the
poor
dead
man
was
put
in
his
place
and
another
wounded
man
was
lifted
out
the
other
dying
men
would
then
move
back
a
little
in
order
not
to
profane
the
dead
ah
what
grief
it
was
when
the
sergeant
said
try
to
take
one
or
two
more
in
it
is
a
pity
to
drag
these
poor
chaps
about
from
one
ambulance
to
another
the
is
well
i
will
take
two
more
i
would
say
and
then
i
wondered
where
we
should
put
them
we
had
to
give
up
our
own
beds
and
in
this
way
the
poor
fellows
were
saved
ever
since
january
we
had
all
three
been
sleeping
every
night
at
the
ambulance
we
had
some
loose
of
thick
grey
flannel
not
unlike
the
cloaks
the
first
of
us
who
heard
a
cry
or
a
groan
sprang
out
of
bed
and
if
necessary
called
the
other
two
on
january
madame
guérard
and
i
were
sitting
up
at
night
on
one
of
the
lounges
in
the
awaiting
the
dismal
cry
of
there
had
been
a
fierce
affray
at
clamart
and
we
knew
there
would
be
many
wounded
i
was
telling
her
of
my
fear
that
the
bombs
which
had
already
reached
the
museum
the
sorbonne
the
salpétrière
the
would
fall
on
the
odéon
but
my
dear
sarah
said
the
sweet
woman
ambulance
flag
is
waving
so
high
above
it
that
there
could
be
no
mistake
if
it
were
struck
it
would
be
purposely
and
that
would
be
guérard
i
replied
should
you
expect
these
execrable
enemies
of
ours
to
be
better
than
we
are
ourselves
did
we
not
behave
like
savages
at
berlin
in
at
paris
there
are
such
admirable
public
monuments
she
urged
and
was
not
moscow
full
of
masterpieces
the
kremlin
is
one
of
the
finest
buildings
in
the
world
that
did
not
prevent
us
giving
that
admirable
city
up
to
pillage
oh
no
my
poor
do
not
deceive
yourself
armies
may
be
russian
german
french
or
spanish
but
they
armies
that
is
they
are
beings
which
form
an
impersonal
a
that
is
ferocious
and
irresponsible
the
germans
will
bombard
the
whole
of
paris
if
the
possibility
of
doing
so
should
be
offered
them
you
must
make
up
your
mind
to
that
my
dear
guérard
i
had
not
finished
my
sentence
when
a
terrible
detonation
roused
the
whole
neighbourhood
from
its
slumbers
madame
guérard
and
i
had
been
seated
opposite
each
other
we
found
ourselves
standing
up
close
together
in
the
middle
of
the
room
terrified
my
poor
cook
her
face
quite
white
came
to
me
for
safety
the
detonations
continued
rather
frequently
the
bombarding
had
commenced
from
our
side
that
night
i
went
round
to
the
wounded
men
but
they
did
not
seem
to
be
much
disturbed
only
one
a
boy
of
fifteen
whom
we
had
surnamed
baby
was
sitting
up
in
bed
when
i
went
to
him
to
soothe
him
he
showed
me
his
little
medal
of
the
holy
virgin
is
thanks
to
her
that
i
was
not
killed
he
said
they
would
put
the
holy
virgin
on
the
ramparts
of
paris
the
bombs
would
not
he
lay
down
again
then
holding
his
little
medal
in
his
hand
and
the
bombarding
continued
until
six
in
the
morning
ambulance
we
then
heard
and
madame
guérard
and
i
went
down
said
the
sergeant
this
man
he
is
losing
all
his
blood
and
if
i
take
him
any
farther
he
will
not
arrive
the
wounded
man
was
put
on
the
litter
but
as
he
was
german
i
asked
the
to
take
all
his
papers
and
hand
them
in
at
the
ministry
we
gave
the
man
the
place
of
one
of
the
convalescents
whom
i
installed
elsewhere
i
asked
him
his
name
and
he
told
me
that
it
was
frantz
mayer
and
that
he
was
a
soldier
of
the
silesian
landwehr
he
then
fainted
from
weakness
caused
by
loss
of
blood
but
he
soon
came
to
himself
again
with
our
care
and
i
then
asked
him
whether
he
wanted
anything
but
he
did
not
answer
a
word
i
supposed
that
he
did
not
speak
french
and
as
there
was
no
one
at
the
ambulance
who
spoke
german
i
waited
until
the
next
day
to
send
for
some
one
who
knew
his
language
i
must
own
that
the
poor
man
was
not
welcomed
by
his
dormitory
companions
a
soldier
named
fortin
who
was
years
of
age
and
a
veritable
child
of
paris
a
comical
fellow
mischievous
droll
and
never
ceased
railing
against
the
young
german
who
on
his
side
never
flinched
i
went
several
times
to
fortin
and
begged
him
to
be
quiet
but
it
was
all
in
vain
every
fresh
outbreak
of
his
was
greeted
with
wild
laughter
and
his
success
put
him
into
the
gayest
of
humours
so
that
he
continued
getting
more
and
more
excited
the
others
were
prevented
from
sleeping
and
he
moved
about
wildly
in
his
bed
bursting
out
into
abusive
language
when
too
abrupt
a
movement
intensified
his
suffering
the
unfortunate
fellow
had
had
his
sciatic
nerve
torn
by
a
bullet
and
he
had
to
endure
the
most
atrocious
pain
after
my
third
fruitless
appeal
for
silence
i
ordered
the
two
men
attendants
to
carry
him
into
a
room
where
he
would
be
alone
he
sent
for
me
and
when
i
went
to
him
promised
to
behave
well
all
night
long
i
therefore
countermanded
the
order
i
had
given
and
he
kept
his
word
the
following
day
i
had
frantz
mayer
carried
into
a
room
where
there
was
a
young
breton
who
had
had
his
skull
fractured
by
the
bursting
of
a
shell
and
therefore
needed
the
utmost
tranquillity
one
of
my
friends
who
spoke
german
very
well
came
to
see
whether
the
silesian
wanted
anything
the
wounded
face
lighted
up
on
hearing
his
own
language
and
then
turning
to
me
he
said
understand
french
quite
well
madame
and
if
i
listened
calmly
to
the
horrors
poured
forth
by
your
french
soldier
it
was
because
i
know
that
you
can
not
hold
out
two
days
longer
and
i
can
understand
his
why
do
you
think
that
we
can
not
hold
out
i
know
that
you
are
reduced
to
eating
duchesne
had
just
arrived
and
he
was
dressing
the
horrible
wound
which
the
patient
had
in
his
thigh
he
said
friend
as
soon
as
your
fever
has
decreased
you
shall
eat
an
excellent
wing
of
the
german
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
the
doctor
continued
drink
this
and
tell
me
what
you
think
of
duchesne
gave
him
a
glass
of
water
with
a
little
of
the
excellent
cognac
which
the
prefect
had
sent
me
that
was
the
only
that
my
soldiers
took
the
silesian
said
no
more
but
he
put
on
the
reserved
circumspect
manner
of
people
who
know
and
will
not
speak
the
bombardment
continued
and
the
ambulance
flag
certainly
served
as
a
target
for
our
enemies
for
they
fired
with
surprising
exactitude
and
altered
their
firing
directly
a
bomb
fell
any
distance
from
the
neighbourhood
of
the
luxembourg
thanks
to
this
we
had
more
than
twelve
bombs
one
night
these
dismal
shells
when
they
burst
in
the
air
were
like
the
fireworks
at
a
the
shining
splinters
then
fell
down
black
and
deadly
georges
boyer
who
at
that
time
was
a
young
journalist
came
to
call
on
me
at
the
ambulance
and
i
told
him
about
the
terrifying
splendours
of
the
night
how
much
i
should
like
to
see
all
that
he
said
this
evening
towards
nine
or
ten
and
you
will
see
i
replied
we
spent
several
hours
at
the
little
round
window
of
my
dressing
room
which
looked
out
towards
chatillon
it
was
from
there
that
the
germans
fired
the
most
we
listened
in
the
silence
of
the
night
to
the
muffled
sounds
coming
from
yonder
there
would
be
a
light
a
formidable
noise
in
the
distance
and
the
bomb
arrived
falling
in
front
of
us
or
behind
bursting
either
in
the
air
or
on
reaching
its
goal
once
we
had
only
just
time
to
draw
back
quickly
and
even
then
the
disturbance
in
the
atmosphere
affected
us
so
violently
that
for
a
second
we
were
under
the
impression
that
we
had
been
struck
the
shell
had
fallen
just
underneath
my
grazing
the
cornice
which
it
dragged
down
in
its
fall
to
the
ground
where
it
burst
feebly
but
what
was
our
amazement
to
see
a
little
crowd
of
children
swoop
down
on
the
burning
pieces
just
like
a
lot
of
sparrows
on
fresh
manure
when
the
carriage
has
passed
the
little
vagabonds
were
quarrelling
over
the
of
these
engines
of
warfare
i
wondered
what
they
could
possibly
do
with
them
there
is
not
much
mystery
about
it
said
boyer
little
starving
urchins
will
sell
this
proved
to
be
true
one
of
the
men
attendants
whom
i
sent
to
find
out
brought
back
with
him
a
child
of
about
ten
years
old
are
you
going
to
do
with
that
my
little
man
i
asked
him
picking
up
the
piece
of
shell
which
was
warm
and
still
dangerous
on
the
edge
where
it
had
burst
am
going
to
sell
it
he
replied
for
buy
my
turn
in
the
when
the
meat
is
being
you
risk
your
life
my
poor
child
sometimes
the
shells
come
quickly
one
after
the
other
where
were
you
when
this
one
fell
down
on
the
stone
of
the
wall
that
supports
the
iron
he
pointed
across
to
the
luxembourg
gardens
opposite
the
stage
entrance
to
the
odéon
we
bought
up
all
the
that
the
child
had
without
attempting
to
give
him
advice
which
might
have
sounded
wise
what
was
the
use
of
preaching
wisdom
to
this
poor
little
creature
who
heard
of
nothing
but
massacres
fire
revenge
retaliation
and
all
the
rest
of
it
for
the
sake
of
honour
for
the
sake
of
religion
for
the
sake
of
right
besides
how
was
it
possible
to
keep
out
of
the
way
all
the
people
living
in
the
faubourg
germain
were
liable
to
be
blown
to
pieces
as
the
enemy
very
luckily
could
only
bombard
paris
on
that
side
and
not
at
every
point
no
we
were
certainly
in
the
most
dangerous
neighbourhood
one
day
baron
larrey
came
to
see
frantz
mayer
who
was
very
ill
he
wrote
a
prescription
which
a
young
errand
boy
was
told
to
wait
for
and
bring
back
very
very
quickly
as
the
boy
was
rather
given
to
loitering
i
went
to
the
window
his
name
was
victor
but
we
called
him
the
druggist
lived
at
the
corner
of
the
place
medicis
it
was
then
six
in
the
evening
toto
looked
up
and
on
seeing
me
he
began
to
laugh
and
jump
as
he
hurried
to
the
he
had
only
five
or
six
more
yards
to
go
and
as
he
turned
round
to
look
up
at
my
window
i
clapped
my
hands
and
called
out
be
quick
back
alas
before
the
poor
boy
could
open
his
mouth
to
reply
he
was
cut
in
two
by
a
shell
which
had
just
fallen
it
did
not
burst
but
bounced
a
yard
high
and
then
struck
poor
toto
right
in
the
middle
of
the
chest
i
uttered
such
a
shriek
that
every
one
came
rushing
to
me
i
could
not
speak
but
pushed
every
one
aside
and
rushed
downstairs
beckoning
for
some
one
to
come
with
me
i
managed
to
articulate
ah
what
a
horror
what
an
awful
horror
when
we
reached
the
poor
child
his
intestines
were
all
over
the
ground
his
chest
and
his
poor
little
red
chubby
face
had
the
flesh
entirely
taken
off
he
had
neither
eyes
nose
nor
mouth
nothing
nothing
but
some
hair
at
the
end
of
a
shapeless
bleeding
mass
a
yard
away
from
his
head
it
was
as
though
a
tiger
had
torn
open
the
body
with
its
claws
and
emptied
it
with
fury
and
a
refinement
of
cruelty
leaving
nothing
but
the
poor
little
skeleton
baron
larrey
who
was
the
best
of
men
turned
slightly
pale
at
this
sight
he
saw
plenty
such
certainly
but
this
poor
little
fellow
was
a
quite
useless
holocaust
ah
the
injustice
the
infamy
of
war
will
the
much
dreamed
of
time
never
come
when
wars
are
no
longer
possible
when
the
monarch
who
wants
war
will
be
dethroned
and
imprisoned
as
a
malefactor
will
the
time
never
come
when
there
will
be
a
cosmopolitan
council
where
a
wise
man
of
every
country
will
represent
his
nation
and
where
the
rights
of
humanity
will
be
discussed
and
respected
so
many
men
think
as
i
do
so
many
women
talk
as
i
do
and
yet
nothing
is
done
the
pusillanimity
of
an
oriental
the
of
a
sovereign
may
still
bring
thousands
of
men
face
to
face
and
there
will
still
be
men
who
are
so
learned
chemists
who
spend
their
time
in
dreaming
about
and
inventing
a
powder
to
blow
everything
up
bombs
that
will
wound
twenty
or
thirty
men
guns
repeating
their
deadly
task
until
the
bullets
fall
spent
themselves
after
having
torn
open
ten
or
twelve
human
breasts
a
man
whom
i
liked
very
much
was
busy
experimenting
how
to
steer
balloons
to
achieve
that
means
a
realisation
of
my
dream
namely
to
fly
in
the
air
to
approach
the
sky
and
have
under
feet
the
moist
clouds
ah
how
interested
i
was
in
my
researches
one
day
though
he
came
to
me
very
much
excited
with
a
new
discovery
have
discovered
something
about
which
i
am
wild
with
delight
he
said
he
then
began
to
explain
to
me
that
his
balloon
would
be
able
to
carry
inflammable
matter
without
the
least
danger
thanks
to
this
and
thanks
to
that
what
for
i
asked
bewildered
by
his
explanations
and
half
crazy
with
so
many
technical
words
for
he
repeated
for
war
he
replied
shall
be
able
to
fire
and
to
throw
terrible
bombs
to
a
distance
of
a
thousand
twelve
hundred
and
even
fifteen
hundred
yards
and
it
would
be
impossible
for
us
to
be
harmed
at
such
a
distance
my
balloons
thanks
to
a
substance
which
is
my
invention
with
which
the
covering
would
be
coated
would
have
nothing
to
fear
from
fire
nor
yet
from
do
not
want
to
know
anything
more
about
you
or
your
invention
i
said
interrupting
him
brusquely
thought
you
were
a
humane
savant
and
you
are
a
wild
beast
your
researches
were
in
connection
with
the
most
beautiful
manifestation
of
human
genius
with
those
evolutions
in
the
sky
which
i
loved
so
dearly
you
want
now
to
transform
these
into
cowardly
attacks
turned
against
the
earth
you
horrify
me
do
go
with
this
i
left
my
friend
to
himself
and
his
cruel
invention
ashamed
for
a
moment
his
efforts
have
not
succeeded
though
according
to
his
wishes
the
remains
of
the
poor
lad
were
put
into
a
small
coffin
and
madame
guérard
and
i
followed
the
hearse
to
the
grave
the
morning
was
so
cold
that
the
driver
had
to
stop
and
take
a
glass
of
hot
wine
as
otherwise
he
might
have
died
of
congestion
we
were
alone
in
the
carriage
for
the
boy
had
been
brought
up
by
his
grandmother
who
could
not
walk
at
all
and
who
knitted
vests
and
stockings
it
was
through
going
to
order
some
vests
and
socks
for
my
men
that
i
had
made
the
acquaintance
of
mère
tricottin
as
she
was
called
at
her
request
i
had
engaged
her
grandson
victor
durieux
as
an
errand
boy
and
the
poor
old
woman
had
been
so
grateful
that
i
dared
not
go
now
to
tell
her
of
his
death
madame
guérard
went
for
me
to
the
rue
de
vaugirard
where
the
old
woman
lived
as
soon
as
she
arrived
the
poor
grandmother
could
see
by
her
sad
face
that
something
had
happened
my
dear
madame
is
the
poor
little
thin
lady
dead
this
referred
to
me
madame
guérard
then
told
her
as
gently
as
possible
the
sad
news
the
old
woman
took
off
her
spectacles
looked
at
her
visitor
wiped
them
and
put
them
on
her
nose
again
she
then
began
to
grumble
violently
about
her
son
the
father
of
the
dead
boy
he
had
taken
up
with
some
low
girl
by
whom
he
had
had
this
child
and
she
had
always
foreseen
that
misfortune
would
come
upon
them
through
it
she
continued
in
this
strain
not
sorrowing
for
the
poor
boy
but
abusing
her
son
who
was
a
soldier
in
the
army
of
the
loire
although
the
grandmother
seemed
to
feel
so
little
grief
i
went
to
see
her
after
the
funeral
is
all
over
madame
durieux
i
said
i
have
secured
the
grave
for
a
period
of
five
years
for
the
poor
she
turned
towards
me
quite
comic
in
her
vexation
madness
she
exclaimed
that
with
the
he
want
for
anything
it
would
have
been
better
to
have
taken
a
bit
of
land
that
would
have
brought
something
in
dead
folks
make
vegetables
this
outburst
was
so
terribly
logical
that
in
spite
of
the
odious
brutality
of
it
i
yielded
to
mère
desire
and
gave
her
the
same
present
i
had
given
to
the
boy
they
should
each
have
their
bit
of
land
the
child
who
had
had
a
right
to
a
longer
life
should
sleep
his
eternal
sleep
in
his
whilst
the
old
woman
could
wrest
from
hers
the
remainder
of
her
life
for
which
death
was
lying
in
wait
i
returned
to
the
ambulance
sad
and
unnerved
a
joyful
surprise
was
awaiting
me
a
friend
of
mine
was
there
holding
in
his
hand
a
very
small
piece
of
tissue
paper
on
which
were
the
following
two
lines
in
my
handwriting
are
all
very
well
and
at
i
was
furious
on
reading
this
at
homburg
all
my
family
at
homburg
settling
down
tranquilly
in
the
country
i
racked
my
brains
to
think
by
what
extraordinary
combination
my
mother
had
gone
to
homburg
i
knew
that
my
pretty
aunt
rosine
had
a
lady
friend
there
with
whom
she
stayed
every
year
for
she
always
spent
two
months
at
homburg
two
at
and
one
month
at
spa
as
she
was
the
greatest
gambler
that
the
ever
created
anyhow
those
who
were
so
dear
to
me
were
all
well
and
that
was
the
important
point
but
i
was
nevertheless
annoyed
with
my
mother
for
going
to
homburg
i
heartily
thanked
the
friend
who
had
brought
me
the
little
slip
of
paper
it
was
sent
to
me
by
the
american
minister
who
had
put
himself
to
no
end
of
trouble
in
order
to
give
help
and
consolation
to
the
parisians
i
then
gave
him
a
few
lines
for
my
mother
in
case
he
might
be
able
to
send
them
to
her
the
bombardment
of
paris
continued
one
night
the
brothers
from
the
ecole
chrétienne
came
to
ask
us
for
conveyances
and
help
in
order
to
collect
the
dead
on
the
châtillon
plateau
i
let
them
have
my
two
conveyances
and
i
went
with
them
to
the
ah
what
a
terrible
memory
it
was
like
a
scene
from
dante
it
was
an
night
and
we
could
scarcely
move
along
finally
by
the
light
of
torches
and
lanterns
we
saw
that
we
had
arrived
i
got
out
of
the
vehicle
with
the
infirmary
attendant
and
his
assistant
we
had
to
move
slowly
as
at
every
step
we
trod
upon
the
dying
or
the
dead
we
passed
along
murmuring
ambulance
when
we
heard
a
groan
we
turned
our
steps
in
the
direction
whence
it
came
ah
the
first
man
that
i
found
in
this
way
he
was
half
lying
down
his
body
supported
by
a
heap
of
dead
i
raised
my
lantern
to
look
at
his
face
and
found
that
his
ear
and
part
of
his
jaw
had
been
blown
off
great
clots
of
blood
coagulated
by
the
cold
hung
from
his
lower
jaw
there
was
a
wild
look
in
his
eyes
i
took
a
wisp
of
straw
dipped
it
in
my
flask
drew
up
a
few
drops
of
brandy
and
blew
them
into
the
poor
mouth
between
his
teeth
i
repeated
this
three
or
four
times
a
little
life
then
came
back
to
him
and
we
took
him
away
in
one
of
the
vehicles
the
same
thing
was
done
for
the
others
some
of
them
could
drink
from
the
flask
which
made
our
work
shorter
one
of
these
unfortunate
men
was
frightful
to
look
at
a
shell
had
taken
all
the
clothes
from
the
upper
part
of
his
body
with
the
exception
of
two
ragged
sleeves
which
hung
from
the
arms
at
the
shoulders
there
was
no
trace
of
a
wound
but
his
poor
body
was
marked
all
over
with
great
black
patches
and
the
blood
was
oozing
slowly
from
the
corners
of
his
mouth
i
went
nearer
to
him
for
it
seemed
to
me
that
he
was
breathing
i
had
a
few
drops
of
the
vivifying
cordial
given
to
him
and
he
then
half
opened
his
eyes
and
said
he
was
lifted
into
the
conveyance
but
the
poor
fellow
died
from
an
attack
of
haemorrhage
covering
all
the
other
wounded
men
with
a
stream
of
dark
blood
daylight
gradually
began
to
appear
a
misty
dull
dawn
the
lanterns
had
burnt
out
but
we
could
now
distinguish
each
other
there
were
about
a
hundred
persons
there
sisters
of
charity
military
and
civil
male
hospital
attendants
the
brothers
from
the
ecole
chrétienne
other
priests
and
a
few
ladies
who
like
myself
had
given
themselves
up
heart
and
soul
to
the
service
of
the
wounded
the
sight
was
still
more
dismal
by
daylight
for
all
that
the
night
had
hidden
in
the
shadows
appeared
then
in
the
tardy
wan
light
of
that
january
morning
there
were
so
many
wounded
that
it
was
impossible
to
transport
them
all
and
i
sobbed
at
the
thought
of
my
helplessness
other
vehicles
kept
arriving
but
there
were
so
many
wounded
so
very
many
a
number
of
those
who
had
only
slight
wounds
had
died
of
cold
on
returning
to
the
ambulance
i
met
one
of
my
friends
at
the
door
he
was
a
naval
officer
and
he
had
brought
me
a
sailor
who
had
been
wounded
at
the
fort
of
ivry
he
had
been
shot
below
the
right
eye
he
was
entered
as
désiré
bloas
mate
age
he
was
a
magnificent
fellow
very
frank
looking
and
a
man
of
few
words
as
soon
as
he
was
in
bed
duchesne
sent
for
a
barber
to
shave
him
as
his
bushy
whiskers
had
been
ravaged
by
a
bullet
that
had
lodged
itself
in
the
salivary
gland
carrying
with
it
hair
and
flesh
into
the
wound
the
surgeon
took
up
his
pincers
to
extract
the
pieces
of
flesh
which
had
stopped
up
the
opening
of
the
wound
he
then
had
to
take
some
very
fine
pincers
to
extract
the
hairs
which
had
been
forced
in
when
the
barber
laid
his
razor
very
gently
near
the
wound
the
unfortunate
man
turned
livid
and
an
oath
escaped
his
lips
he
immediately
glanced
at
me
and
muttered
i
was
very
young
but
i
appeared
much
younger
than
my
age
i
looked
like
a
very
young
girl
in
fact
i
was
holding
the
poor
hand
in
mine
and
trying
to
comfort
him
with
the
hundreds
of
consoling
words
that
spring
from
a
heart
to
her
lips
when
she
has
to
soothe
moral
or
physical
suffering
mademoiselle
said
poor
bloas
when
the
wound
was
finally
dressed
gave
me
when
he
was
more
at
his
ease
i
asked
him
if
he
would
like
something
to
eat
he
replied
my
boy
would
you
like
cheese
soup
or
sweets
asked
madame
lambquin
replied
the
fellow
smiling
désiré
bloas
often
talked
to
me
about
his
mother
who
lived
near
brest
he
had
a
veritable
adoration
for
this
mother
but
he
seemed
to
have
a
terrible
grudge
against
his
father
for
one
day
when
i
asked
him
whether
his
father
was
still
living
he
looked
up
with
his
fearless
eyes
and
appeared
to
fix
them
on
a
being
only
visible
to
himself
as
though
challenging
him
with
an
expression
of
the
most
pitiful
contempt
alas
the
brave
fellow
was
destined
to
a
cruel
end
but
i
will
return
to
that
later
the
sufferings
endured
through
the
siege
began
to
have
their
effect
on
the
of
the
parisians
bread
had
just
been
rationed
out
there
were
to
be
grammes
for
adults
and
grammes
for
children
a
silent
fury
took
possession
of
the
people
at
this
news
women
were
the
most
courageous
the
men
were
excited
quarrels
grew
bitter
for
some
wanted
war
to
the
very
death
and
others
wanted
peace
one
day
when
i
entered
frantz
room
to
take
him
his
meal
he
went
into
the
most
ridiculous
rage
he
threw
his
piece
of
chicken
down
on
the
ground
and
declared
that
he
would
not
eat
anything
nothing
more
at
all
for
they
had
deceived
him
by
telling
him
that
the
parisians
had
not
enough
food
to
last
two
days
before
surrendering
and
he
had
been
in
the
ambulance
seventeen
days
now
and
was
having
chicken
what
the
poor
fellow
did
not
know
was
that
i
had
bought
about
forty
chickens
and
six
geese
at
the
beginning
of
the
siege
and
i
was
feeding
them
up
in
my
in
the
rue
de
rome
oh
my
was
very
pretty
just
then
but
i
let
frantz
believe
that
all
paris
was
full
of
chickens
ducks
geese
and
other
domestic
bipeds
the
bombardment
continued
and
one
night
i
had
to
have
all
my
patients
transported
to
the
odéon
cellars
for
when
madame
guérard
was
helping
one
of
the
sick
men
to
get
back
into
bed
a
shell
fell
on
the
bed
itself
between
her
and
the
officer
it
makes
me
shudder
even
now
to
think
that
three
minutes
sooner
the
unfortunate
man
would
have
been
killed
as
he
lay
in
bed
although
the
shell
did
not
burst
we
could
not
stay
long
in
the
cellars
the
water
was
getting
deeper
in
them
and
rats
tormented
us
i
therefore
decided
that
the
ambulance
must
be
moved
and
i
had
the
worst
of
the
patients
conveyed
to
the
hospital
i
kept
about
twenty
men
who
were
on
the
road
to
convalescence
i
rented
an
immense
empty
flat
for
them
at
rue
taitbout
and
it
was
there
that
we
awaited
the
armistice
i
was
half
dead
with
anxiety
as
i
had
had
no
news
from
my
own
family
for
a
long
time
i
could
not
sleep
and
had
become
the
very
shadow
of
my
former
self
jules
favre
was
entrusted
with
the
negotiations
with
bismarck
oh
those
two
days
of
preliminaries
they
were
the
most
unnerving
days
of
any
for
the
besieged
false
reports
were
spread
we
were
told
of
the
maddest
and
most
exorbitant
demands
on
the
part
of
the
germans
who
certainly
were
not
tender
to
the
vanquished
there
was
a
moment
of
stupor
when
we
heard
that
we
had
to
pay
two
hundred
million
francs
in
cash
immediately
for
our
finances
were
in
such
a
pitiful
state
that
we
shuddered
at
the
idea
that
we
might
not
be
able
to
make
up
the
sum
of
two
hundred
millions
baron
alphonse
de
rothschild
who
was
shut
up
in
paris
with
his
wife
and
brothers
gave
his
signature
for
the
two
hundred
millions
this
fine
deed
was
soon
forgotten
and
there
are
even
people
who
gainsay
it
ah
the
ingratitude
of
the
masses
is
a
disgrace
to
civilised
humanity
is
the
evil
peculiar
to
the
white
races
said
a
and
he
was
right
when
we
heard
in
paris
that
the
armistice
was
signed
for
twenty
days
a
frightful
sadness
took
possession
of
us
all
even
of
those
who
most
ardently
wished
for
peace
every
parisian
felt
on
his
cheek
the
hand
of
the
conqueror
it
was
the
brand
of
shame
the
blow
given
by
the
abominable
treaty
of
peace
oh
that
of
january
i
remember
so
well
that
i
was
anaemic
from
privation
undermined
by
grief
tortured
with
anxiety
about
my
family
and
i
went
out
with
madame
guérard
and
two
friends
towards
the
parc
monceau
suddenly
one
of
my
friends
de
plancy
turned
as
pale
as
death
i
looked
to
see
what
was
the
matter
and
noticed
a
soldier
passing
by
he
had
no
weapons
two
others
passed
and
they
also
had
no
weapons
and
they
were
so
pale
too
these
poor
disarmed
soldiers
these
humble
heroes
there
was
such
evident
grief
and
hopelessness
in
their
very
gait
and
their
eyes
as
they
looked
at
us
women
seemed
to
say
is
not
our
fault
it
was
all
so
pitiful
so
touching
i
burst
out
sobbing
and
went
back
home
at
once
for
i
did
not
want
to
meet
any
more
disarmed
french
soldiers
i
decided
to
set
off
now
as
quickly
as
possible
in
search
of
my
family
i
asked
paul
de
rémusat
to
get
me
an
audience
with
thiers
in
order
to
obtain
from
him
a
passport
for
leaving
paris
but
i
could
not
go
alone
i
felt
that
the
journey
i
was
about
to
undertake
was
a
very
dangerous
one
thiers
and
paul
de
rémusat
had
warned
me
of
this
i
could
see
therefore
that
i
should
be
constantly
in
the
society
of
my
travelling
companion
and
on
this
account
i
decided
not
to
take
a
servant
with
me
but
a
friend
i
very
naturally
went
at
once
to
madame
guérard
her
husband
gentle
though
he
was
refused
absolutely
to
let
her
go
with
me
as
he
considered
this
expedition
mad
and
dangerous
mad
it
certainly
was
and
dangerous
too
i
did
not
insist
but
i
sent
for
my
governess
mlle
soubise
i
asked
her
whether
she
would
go
with
me
and
did
not
attempt
to
conceal
from
her
any
of
the
dangers
of
the
journey
she
jumped
with
joy
and
said
she
would
be
ready
within
twelve
hours
this
girl
is
at
present
the
wife
of
commandant
monfils
chesneau
and
how
strange
life
is
for
she
is
now
teaching
the
two
daughters
of
my
son
her
former
pupil
mlle
soubise
was
then
very
young
and
in
appearance
like
a
creole
she
had
very
beautiful
dark
eyes
with
a
gentle
timid
expression
and
the
voice
of
a
child
her
head
however
was
full
of
adventure
romance
and
in
appearance
we
might
both
have
been
taken
for
quite
young
girls
for
although
i
was
older
than
she
was
my
slenderness
and
my
face
made
me
look
younger
it
would
have
been
absurd
to
try
to
take
a
trunk
with
us
so
i
took
a
bag
for
us
both
we
only
had
a
change
of
linen
and
some
stockings
i
had
my
revolver
and
i
offered
one
to
mlle
soubise
but
she
refused
it
with
horror
and
showed
me
an
enormous
pair
of
scissors
in
an
enormous
case
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
them
i
asked
shall
kill
myself
if
we
are
attacked
she
replied
i
was
surprised
at
the
difference
in
our
characters
i
was
taking
a
revolver
determined
to
protect
myself
by
killing
others
she
was
determined
to
protect
herself
by
killing
herself
xviii
a
bold
journey
through
the
german
lines
on
february
we
started
on
this
journey
which
was
to
have
lasted
three
days
and
lasted
eleven
at
the
first
gate
at
which
i
presented
myself
for
leaving
paris
i
was
sent
back
in
the
most
brutal
fashion
permissions
to
go
outside
the
city
had
to
be
submitted
for
signature
at
the
german
outposts
i
went
to
another
gate
but
it
was
only
at
the
postern
gate
of
poissonniers
that
i
could
get
my
passport
signed
we
were
taken
into
a
little
shed
which
had
been
transformed
into
an
office
a
prussian
general
was
seated
there
he
looked
me
up
and
down
and
then
said
you
sarah
bernhardt
i
answered
this
young
lady
is
with
you
you
think
you
are
going
to
cross
easily
hope
then
you
are
mistaken
and
you
would
do
better
to
stay
inside
i
want
to
leave
see
myself
what
will
happen
but
i
want
to
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
called
an
officer
said
something
i
did
not
understand
in
german
and
then
went
out
leaving
us
alone
without
our
passports
we
had
been
there
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
when
i
suddenly
heard
a
voice
i
knew
it
was
that
of
one
of
my
friends
rené
griffon
who
had
heard
of
my
departure
and
had
come
after
me
to
try
to
dissuade
me
the
trouble
he
had
taken
was
all
in
vain
though
as
i
was
determined
to
leave
the
general
returned
soon
after
and
griffon
was
anxious
to
know
what
might
happen
to
us
returned
the
officer
worse
than
everything
griffon
spoke
german
and
had
a
short
colloquy
with
the
officer
about
us
this
rather
annoyed
me
for
as
i
did
not
understand
i
imagined
that
he
was
urging
the
general
to
prevent
us
from
starting
i
nevertheless
resisted
all
persuasions
supplications
and
even
threats
a
few
minutes
later
a
vehicle
drew
up
at
the
door
of
the
shed
you
are
said
the
german
officer
roughly
am
sending
you
to
gonesse
where
you
will
find
the
provision
train
which
starts
in
an
hour
i
am
recommending
you
to
the
care
of
the
the
commandant
x
after
that
may
god
take
care
of
you
i
stepped
into
the
carriage
and
said
farewell
to
my
friend
who
was
in
despair
we
arrived
at
gonesse
and
got
out
at
the
station
where
we
saw
a
little
group
of
people
talking
in
low
voices
the
coachman
made
me
a
military
salute
refused
what
i
wished
to
give
him
and
drove
away
at
full
speed
i
advanced
towards
the
group
wondering
to
whom
i
ought
to
speak
when
a
friendly
voice
exclaimed
you
here
where
have
you
come
from
where
are
you
going
it
was
villaret
the
tenor
in
vogue
at
the
opéra
he
was
going
to
his
young
wife
i
believe
of
whom
he
had
had
no
news
for
five
months
he
introduced
one
of
his
friends
who
was
travelling
with
him
and
whose
name
i
do
not
remember
general
son
and
a
very
old
man
so
pale
and
so
and
woebegone
that
i
felt
quite
sorry
for
him
he
was
a
gerson
and
was
going
to
belgium
to
take
his
grandson
to
his
his
two
sons
had
been
killed
during
this
pitiful
war
one
of
the
sons
was
married
and
his
wife
had
died
of
sorrow
and
despair
he
was
taking
the
orphan
boy
to
his
godmother
and
he
hoped
to
die
himself
as
soon
as
possible
afterwards
ah
the
poor
fellow
he
was
only
then
and
he
was
so
cruelly
ravaged
by
his
grief
that
i
took
him
for
seventy
besides
these
five
persons
there
was
an
unbearable
chatterer
named
théodore
joussian
a
wine
dealer
oh
he
did
not
require
any
introduction
do
you
do
madame
he
began
fortunate
that
you
are
going
to
travel
with
us
ah
the
journey
will
be
a
difficult
one
where
are
you
going
two
women
alone
it
is
not
at
all
prudent
especially
as
all
the
routes
are
crowded
with
german
and
french
sharpshooters
marauders
and
thieves
oh
i
demolished
some
of
those
german
sharpshooters
sh
we
must
speak
quietly
though
these
sly
fellows
are
very
quick
of
hearing
he
then
pointed
to
the
german
officers
who
were
walking
up
and
down
the
rascals
he
went
on
i
had
my
uniform
and
my
gun
they
would
not
walk
so
boldly
in
front
of
théodore
joussian
i
have
no
fewer
than
six
helmets
at
home
the
man
got
on
my
nerves
and
i
turned
my
back
on
him
and
looked
to
see
which
of
the
men
before
me
could
be
the
a
tall
young
german
with
his
arm
in
a
sling
came
towards
me
with
an
open
letter
it
was
the
one
which
the
coachman
had
handed
to
him
recommending
me
to
his
care
he
held
out
his
sound
arm
to
me
but
i
refused
it
he
bowed
and
led
the
way
and
i
followed
him
accompanied
by
mlle
soubise
on
arriving
in
his
office
he
gave
us
seats
at
a
little
table
upon
which
knives
and
forks
were
placed
for
two
persons
it
was
then
three
in
the
afternoon
and
we
had
had
nothing
not
even
a
drop
of
water
since
the
evening
before
i
was
very
much
touched
by
this
thoughtfulness
and
we
did
honour
to
the
very
simple
but
refreshing
meal
offered
us
by
the
young
officer
whilst
we
lunched
i
looked
at
him
when
he
was
not
noticing
me
he
was
very
young
and
his
face
bore
traces
of
recent
suffering
i
felt
a
compassionate
tenderness
for
this
unfortunate
man
who
was
crippled
for
life
and
my
hatred
for
war
increased
still
more
he
suddenly
said
to
me
in
rather
bad
french
think
i
can
give
you
news
of
one
of
your
is
his
name
i
asked
yes
he
is
certainly
a
great
friend
of
mine
how
is
he
is
still
a
prisoner
but
he
is
very
i
thought
he
had
been
released
i
said
of
those
who
were
taken
with
him
were
released
on
giving
their
word
never
to
take
up
arms
against
us
again
but
he
refused
to
give
his
the
brave
soldier
i
exclaimed
in
spite
of
myself
the
young
german
looked
at
me
with
his
clear
sad
eyes
he
said
simply
brave
soldier
when
we
had
finished
our
luncheon
i
rose
to
return
to
the
other
travellers
compartment
reserved
for
you
will
not
be
here
for
two
hours
said
the
young
officer
you
would
like
to
rest
ladies
i
will
come
for
you
at
the
right
he
went
away
and
before
long
i
was
sound
asleep
i
was
nearly
dead
with
fatigue
mlle
soubise
touched
me
on
the
shoulder
to
rouse
me
the
train
was
ready
to
start
and
the
young
officer
walked
with
me
to
it
i
was
a
little
amazed
when
i
saw
the
carriage
in
which
i
was
to
travel
it
had
no
roof
and
was
filled
with
coal
the
officer
had
several
empty
sacks
put
in
one
on
the
top
of
the
other
to
make
our
seats
less
hard
he
sent
for
his
cloak
begging
me
to
take
it
with
us
and
send
it
him
back
but
i
refused
this
odious
disguise
most
energetically
it
was
a
deadly
cold
day
but
i
preferred
dying
of
cold
to
muffling
up
in
a
cloak
belonging
to
the
enemy
the
whistle
was
blown
the
wounded
officer
saluted
and
the
train
started
there
were
prussian
soldiers
in
the
carriages
the
subordinates
the
employés
and
the
soldiers
were
just
as
brutish
and
rude
as
the
german
officers
were
polite
and
courteous
the
train
stopped
without
any
plausible
reason
it
started
again
to
stop
again
and
it
then
stood
still
for
an
hour
on
this
night
on
arriving
at
creil
the
stoker
the
the
soldiers
and
every
one
else
got
out
i
watched
all
these
men
whistling
bawling
to
each
other
spitting
and
bursting
into
laughter
as
they
pointed
to
us
were
they
not
the
conquerors
and
we
the
conquered
at
creil
we
stayed
more
than
two
hours
we
could
hear
the
distant
sound
of
foreign
music
and
the
hurrahs
of
germans
who
were
making
merry
all
this
hubbub
came
from
a
white
house
about
five
hundred
yards
away
we
could
distinguish
the
outlines
of
human
beings
locked
in
each
arms
waltzing
and
turning
round
and
round
in
a
giddy
revel
it
began
to
get
on
my
nerves
for
it
seemed
likely
to
continue
until
daylight
i
got
out
with
villaret
intending
at
any
rate
to
stretch
my
limbs
we
went
towards
the
white
house
and
then
as
i
did
not
want
to
tell
him
my
plan
i
asked
him
to
wait
there
for
me
very
fortunately
though
for
me
i
had
not
time
to
cross
the
threshold
of
this
vile
for
an
officer
smoking
a
cigarette
was
just
coming
out
of
a
small
door
he
spoke
to
me
in
german
am
french
i
replied
and
he
then
came
up
to
me
speaking
my
language
for
they
could
all
talk
french
he
asked
me
what
i
was
doing
there
my
nerves
were
overstrung
i
told
him
feverishly
of
our
lamentable
odyssey
since
our
departure
from
gonesse
and
finally
of
our
waiting
two
hours
in
an
carriage
while
the
stokers
and
conductors
were
all
dancing
in
this
house
i
had
no
idea
that
there
were
passengers
in
those
carriages
and
it
was
i
who
gave
permission
to
these
men
to
dance
and
drink
the
guard
of
the
train
told
me
that
he
was
taking
cattle
and
goods
and
that
he
did
not
need
to
arrive
before
eight
in
the
morning
and
i
believed
him
monsieur
i
said
only
cattle
in
the
train
are
the
eight
french
passengers
and
i
should
be
very
much
obliged
if
you
would
give
orders
that
the
journey
should
be
your
mind
easy
about
that
madame
he
replied
you
come
in
and
rest
i
am
here
just
now
on
a
round
of
inspection
and
am
staying
for
a
few
days
in
this
inn
you
shall
have
a
cup
of
tea
and
that
will
refresh
i
told
him
that
i
had
a
friend
waiting
for
me
in
the
road
and
a
lady
in
the
railway
carriage
that
makes
no
difference
he
said
us
go
and
fetch
a
few
minutes
later
we
found
poor
villaret
seated
on
a
milestone
his
head
was
on
his
knees
and
he
was
asleep
i
asked
him
to
fetch
mlle
soubise
if
your
other
travelling
companions
will
come
and
take
a
cup
of
tea
they
will
be
welcome
said
the
officer
i
went
back
with
him
and
we
entered
by
the
little
door
through
which
i
had
seen
him
come
out
it
was
a
fairly
large
room
which
we
entered
on
a
level
with
the
meadow
there
were
some
mats
on
the
floor
a
very
low
bed
and
an
enormous
table
on
which
were
two
large
maps
of
france
one
of
these
was
studded
over
with
pins
and
small
flags
there
was
also
a
portrait
of
the
emperor
william
mounted
and
fastened
up
with
four
pins
all
this
belonged
to
the
officer
on
the
under
an
enormous
glass
shade
were
a
wreath
a
military
medal
and
a
plait
of
white
hair
on
each
side
of
the
glass
shade
was
a
china
vase
containing
a
branch
of
box
all
this
together
with
the
table
and
the
bed
belonged
to
the
landlady
who
had
given
up
her
room
to
the
officer
there
were
five
cane
chairs
round
the
table
a
velvet
and
a
wooden
bench
covered
with
books
against
the
wall
a
sword
and
belt
were
lying
on
the
table
and
two
i
was
philosophising
to
myself
on
all
these
heterogeneous
objects
when
the
others
arrived
mlle
soubise
villaret
young
gerson
and
that
unbearable
théodore
joussian
i
hope
he
will
forgive
me
if
he
is
living
now
poor
man
but
the
thought
of
him
still
irritates
me
the
officer
had
some
boiling
hot
tea
made
for
us
and
it
was
a
veritable
treat
as
we
were
exhausted
with
hunger
and
cold
when
the
door
was
opened
for
the
tea
to
be
brought
in
théodore
joussian
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
throng
of
girls
soldiers
and
other
people
my
friends
he
exclaimed
with
a
burst
of
laughter
are
at
his
majesty
there
is
a
reception
on
and
i
can
tell
you
that
with
this
he
smacked
his
tongue
twice
villaret
reminded
him
that
we
were
the
guests
of
a
german
and
that
it
was
preferable
to
be
quiet
enough
enough
he
replied
lighting
a
cigarette
a
frightful
uproar
of
oaths
and
shouts
now
took
the
place
of
the
deafening
sound
of
the
orchestra
and
the
incorrigible
southerner
half
opened
the
door
i
could
see
the
officer
giving
orders
to
two
who
in
their
turn
separated
the
groups
seizing
the
stoker
the
and
the
other
men
belonging
to
the
train
so
roughly
that
i
was
sorry
for
them
they
were
kicked
in
the
back
they
received
blows
with
the
flat
of
the
sword
on
the
shoulder
a
blow
with
the
butt
end
of
a
gun
knocked
the
guard
of
the
train
down
he
was
the
ugliest
brute
though
that
i
have
ever
seen
all
these
people
were
sobered
in
a
few
seconds
and
went
back
towards
our
carriage
with
a
look
and
a
threatening
mien
we
followed
them
but
i
did
not
feel
any
too
satisfied
as
to
what
might
happen
to
us
on
the
way
with
this
queer
lot
the
officer
evidently
had
a
similar
idea
for
he
ordered
one
of
the
to
accompany
us
as
far
as
amiens
this
got
into
our
carriage
and
we
set
off
again
we
arrived
at
amiens
at
six
in
the
morning
daylight
had
not
yet
succeeded
in
piercing
through
the
night
clouds
light
rain
was
falling
which
was
hardened
by
the
cold
there
was
not
a
carriage
to
be
had
not
even
a
porter
i
wanted
to
go
to
the
hôtel
du
but
a
man
who
happened
to
be
there
said
to
me
no
use
my
little
lady
no
room
there
even
for
a
lath
like
you
go
to
the
house
over
there
with
a
balcony
they
can
put
some
people
with
these
words
he
turned
his
back
on
me
villaret
had
gone
off
without
saying
a
word
gerson
and
his
grandson
had
disappeared
silently
in
a
covered
country
cart
hermetically
closed
a
stout
ruddy
matronly
woman
was
waiting
for
them
but
the
coachman
looked
as
though
he
were
in
the
service
of
people
general
son
who
had
not
uttered
a
word
since
we
had
left
gonesse
had
disappeared
like
a
ball
from
the
hands
of
a
conjurer
théodore
joussian
politely
offered
to
accompany
us
and
i
was
so
weary
that
i
accepted
his
offer
he
picked
up
our
bag
and
began
to
walk
at
full
speed
so
that
we
had
difficulty
in
keeping
up
with
him
he
was
so
breathless
with
the
walk
that
he
could
not
talk
which
was
a
great
relief
to
me
finally
we
arrived
at
the
house
and
entered
but
my
horror
was
great
on
seeing
that
the
hall
of
the
hotel
had
been
transformed
into
a
dormitory
we
could
scarcely
walk
between
the
mattresses
laid
down
on
the
ground
and
the
grumbling
of
the
people
was
by
no
means
promising
when
once
we
were
in
the
office
a
young
girl
in
mourning
told
us
that
there
was
not
a
room
vacant
i
sank
down
on
a
chair
and
mlle
soubise
leaned
against
the
wall
with
her
arms
hanging
down
looking
most
dejected
the
odious
joussian
then
yelled
out
that
they
could
not
let
two
women
as
young
as
we
were
be
out
in
the
street
all
night
he
went
to
the
proprietress
of
the
hotel
and
said
something
quietly
about
me
i
do
not
know
what
it
was
but
i
heard
my
name
distinctly
the
young
woman
in
mourning
then
looked
up
with
moist
eyes
brother
was
a
poet
she
said
wrote
a
very
pretty
sonnet
about
you
after
seeing
you
play
in
more
than
ten
times
he
took
me
too
to
see
you
and
i
enjoyed
myself
so
much
that
night
it
is
all
over
she
lifted
her
hands
towards
her
head
and
sobbed
trying
to
stifle
back
her
cries
all
over
she
repeated
is
dead
they
have
killed
him
it
is
all
over
all
over
i
got
up
moved
to
the
depth
of
my
being
by
this
terrible
grief
i
put
my
arms
round
her
and
kissed
her
crying
myself
and
whispering
to
her
words
of
comfort
and
hope
calmed
by
my
words
and
touched
by
my
sisterliness
she
wiped
her
eyes
and
taking
my
hand
led
me
gently
away
soubise
followed
i
signed
to
joussian
in
an
authoritative
way
to
stay
where
he
was
and
we
went
up
the
two
flights
of
stairs
of
the
hotel
in
silence
at
the
end
of
a
narrow
corridor
she
opened
a
door
we
found
ourselves
in
rather
a
big
room
reeking
with
the
smell
of
tobacco
a
small
placed
on
a
little
table
by
the
bed
was
the
only
light
in
this
large
room
the
wheezing
respiration
of
a
human
breast
disturbed
the
silence
i
looked
towards
the
bed
and
by
the
faint
light
from
the
little
lamp
i
saw
a
man
half
seated
propped
up
by
a
heap
of
pillows
the
man
was
rather
than
really
old
his
beard
and
hair
were
white
and
his
face
bore
traces
of
suffering
two
large
furrows
were
formed
from
the
eyes
to
the
corners
of
the
mouth
what
tears
must
have
rolled
down
that
poor
emaciated
face
the
girl
went
quietly
towards
the
bed
signed
to
us
to
come
inside
the
room
and
then
shut
the
door
we
walked
across
on
tiptoes
to
the
far
end
of
the
room
our
arms
stretched
out
to
maintain
our
equilibrium
i
sat
down
with
precaution
on
a
large
empire
couch
and
soubise
took
a
seat
beside
me
the
man
in
bed
half
opened
his
eyes
is
it
my
child
he
asked
father
nothing
serious
she
replied
wanted
to
tell
you
so
that
you
should
not
be
surprised
when
you
woke
up
i
have
just
given
hospitality
in
our
room
to
two
ladies
who
are
he
turned
his
head
in
an
annoyed
way
and
tried
to
look
at
us
at
the
end
of
the
room
lady
with
fair
hair
continued
the
girl
sarah
bernhardt
whom
lucien
liked
so
much
you
remember
the
man
sat
up
and
shading
his
eyes
with
his
hand
peered
at
us
i
went
near
to
him
he
gazed
at
me
silently
and
then
made
a
gesture
with
his
hand
his
daughter
understood
the
gesture
and
brought
him
an
envelope
from
a
small
bureau
the
unhappy
hands
trembled
as
he
took
it
he
drew
out
slowly
three
sheets
of
paper
and
a
photograph
he
fixed
his
gaze
on
me
and
then
on
the
portrait
yes
it
certainly
is
you
it
certainly
is
you
he
murmured
i
recognised
my
photograph
taken
in
smelling
a
rose
see
said
the
poor
man
his
eyes
veiled
by
tears
were
this
idol
these
are
the
lines
he
wrote
about
he
then
read
me
in
his
quavering
voice
with
a
slight
picardian
accent
a
very
pretty
sonnet
which
he
refused
to
give
me
he
then
unfolded
a
second
paper
on
which
some
verses
to
sarah
bernhardt
were
scrawled
the
third
paper
was
a
sort
of
triumphant
chant
celebrating
all
our
victories
over
the
enemy
poor
fellow
still
hoped
until
he
was
killed
said
the
father
has
only
been
dead
five
weeks
he
had
three
shots
in
his
head
the
first
shattered
his
jaw
but
he
did
not
fall
he
continued
firing
on
the
scoundrels
like
a
man
possessed
the
second
took
his
ear
off
and
the
third
struck
him
in
his
right
eye
he
fell
then
never
to
rise
again
his
comrade
told
us
all
this
he
was
years
old
and
now
all
over
the
unhappy
head
fell
back
on
the
heap
of
pillows
his
two
inert
hands
had
let
the
papers
fall
and
great
tears
rolled
down
his
pale
cheeks
in
the
furrows
formed
by
grief
a
stifled
groan
burst
from
his
lips
the
girl
had
fallen
on
her
knees
and
buried
her
head
in
the
to
deaden
the
sound
of
her
sobs
soubise
and
i
were
completely
upset
ah
those
stifled
sobs
those
deadened
groans
seemed
to
buzz
in
my
ears
and
i
felt
everything
giving
way
under
me
i
stretched
my
hands
out
into
space
and
closed
my
eyes
soon
there
was
a
distant
rumbling
noise
which
increased
and
came
nearer
then
yells
of
pain
bones
knocking
against
each
other
the
dull
sound
of
feet
dashing
out
human
brains
armed
men
passed
by
like
a
destructive
whirlwind
shouting
la
guerre
and
women
on
their
knees
with
outstretched
arms
crying
out
is
infamous
in
the
name
of
our
wombs
which
bore
you
of
our
breasts
which
suckled
you
in
the
name
of
our
pain
in
childbirth
in
the
name
of
our
anguish
over
your
cradles
let
this
cease
but
the
savage
whirlwind
passed
by
riding
over
the
women
i
stretched
my
arms
out
in
a
supreme
effort
which
woke
me
suddenly
i
was
lying
in
the
bed
mlle
soubise
who
was
near
me
was
holding
my
hand
a
man
whom
i
did
not
know
but
whom
some
one
called
doctor
laid
me
gently
down
again
on
the
bed
i
had
some
difficulty
in
collecting
my
thoughts
long
have
i
been
here
i
asked
last
night
replied
the
gentle
voice
of
soubise
fainted
and
the
doctor
told
us
that
you
had
an
attack
of
fever
oh
i
have
been
very
frightened
i
turned
my
face
to
the
doctor
dear
lady
he
said
must
be
very
prudent
now
for
the
next
hours
and
then
you
may
set
out
again
but
you
have
had
a
great
many
shocks
for
one
with
such
delicate
health
you
must
take
i
took
the
draught
that
he
was
holding
out
to
me
apologised
to
the
owner
of
the
house
who
had
just
come
in
and
then
turned
round
with
my
face
to
the
wall
i
needed
rest
so
very
very
much
two
days
later
i
left
our
sad
but
kindly
hosts
my
travelling
companions
had
all
disappeared
when
i
went
downstairs
i
kept
meeting
prussians
for
the
unfortunate
proprietor
had
been
invaded
compulsorily
by
the
german
army
he
looked
at
each
soldier
and
at
every
officer
trying
to
find
out
whether
he
were
not
in
presence
of
the
one
who
had
killed
his
poor
boy
he
did
not
tell
me
this
but
it
was
my
idea
it
seemed
to
me
that
such
was
his
thought
and
such
the
meaning
of
his
gaze
in
the
vehicle
in
which
i
drove
to
the
station
the
kind
man
had
put
a
basket
of
food
he
also
gave
me
a
copy
of
the
sonnet
and
a
tracing
of
his
photograph
i
left
the
desolate
couple
with
the
deepest
emotion
and
i
kissed
the
girl
on
taking
our
departure
soubise
and
i
did
not
exchange
a
word
on
our
journey
to
the
railway
station
but
we
were
both
preoccupied
with
the
same
distressing
thoughts
at
the
station
we
found
that
the
germans
were
masters
there
too
i
asked
for
a
compartment
to
ourselves
or
for
a
whatever
they
liked
provided
we
were
alone
i
could
not
make
myself
understood
i
saw
a
man
oiling
the
wheels
of
the
carriages
who
looked
to
me
like
a
frenchman
i
was
not
mistaken
he
was
an
old
man
who
had
been
kept
on
partly
out
of
charity
and
partly
because
he
knew
every
nook
and
corner
and
being
alsatian
spoke
german
this
good
man
took
me
to
the
booking
office
and
explained
my
wish
to
have
a
compartment
to
myself
the
man
who
had
charge
of
the
ticket
office
burst
out
laughing
there
was
neither
first
nor
second
class
he
said
it
was
a
german
train
and
i
should
have
to
travel
like
every
one
else
the
turned
purple
with
rage
which
he
quickly
suppressed
he
had
to
keep
his
place
his
consumptive
wife
was
nursing
their
son
who
had
just
been
sent
home
from
the
hospital
with
his
leg
cut
off
and
the
wound
not
yet
healed
up
there
were
so
many
in
the
hospital
all
this
he
told
me
as
he
took
me
to
the
the
latter
spoke
french
very
well
but
he
was
not
at
all
like
the
other
german
officers
i
had
met
he
scarcely
saluted
me
and
when
i
expressed
my
desire
he
replied
curtly
is
impossible
two
places
shall
be
reserved
for
you
in
the
that
is
what
i
want
to
avoid
i
exclaimed
do
not
want
to
travel
with
german
then
you
shall
be
put
with
german
soldiers
he
growled
angrily
and
putting
on
his
hat
he
went
out
slamming
the
door
i
remained
there
amazed
and
confused
by
the
insolence
of
this
ignoble
brute
i
turned
so
pale
it
appears
and
the
blue
of
my
eyes
became
so
clear
that
soubise
who
was
acquainted
with
my
fits
of
anger
was
very
much
alarmed
be
calm
madame
i
implore
she
said
are
two
women
alone
in
the
midst
of
hostile
people
if
they
liked
to
harm
us
they
could
and
we
must
accomplish
the
aim
and
object
of
our
journey
we
must
see
little
maurice
she
was
very
clever
this
charming
mlle
soubise
and
her
little
speech
had
the
desired
effect
to
see
the
child
again
was
my
aim
and
object
i
calmed
down
and
vowed
that
i
would
not
allow
myself
to
get
angry
during
this
journey
which
promised
to
be
fertile
in
incidents
and
i
almost
kept
my
word
i
left
the
office
and
found
the
poor
alsatian
waiting
at
the
door
i
gave
him
a
couple
of
louis
which
he
hid
away
quickly
and
then
shook
my
hand
as
though
he
would
shake
it
off
ought
not
to
have
that
so
visible
madame
he
said
pointing
to
the
little
bag
i
had
hanging
at
my
side
is
very
i
thanked
him
but
did
not
pay
any
attention
to
his
advice
as
the
train
was
about
to
start
we
entered
the
only
compartment
there
was
in
it
were
two
young
german
officers
they
saluted
and
i
took
this
as
a
good
omen
the
train
whistled
and
i
thought
what
good
luck
we
had
as
no
one
else
would
get
in
well
the
wheels
had
not
turned
round
ten
times
when
the
door
opened
violently
and
five
german
officers
leaped
into
our
carriage
we
were
nine
then
and
what
torture
it
was
the
waved
a
farewell
to
one
of
the
officers
and
both
of
them
burst
out
laughing
as
they
looked
at
us
i
glanced
at
the
friend
he
was
a
and
was
wearing
the
ambulance
badge
on
his
sleeve
his
wide
face
was
congested
and
a
ring
of
sandy
bushy
beard
surrounded
the
lower
part
of
it
two
little
bright
eyes
in
perpetual
movement
lit
up
this
ruddy
face
and
gave
him
a
sly
look
he
was
and
and
gave
one
the
idea
of
having
strength
without
nerves
the
horrid
man
was
still
laughing
when
the
station
and
its
master
were
far
away
from
us
but
what
the
other
one
had
said
was
evidently
very
droll
i
was
in
a
corner
seat
with
soubise
opposite
me
a
young
german
officer
sat
beside
me
and
the
other
young
officer
was
next
to
my
friend
they
were
both
very
gentle
and
polite
and
one
of
them
was
quite
delightful
in
his
youthful
charm
the
took
off
his
helmet
he
was
very
bald
and
had
a
very
small
forehead
he
began
to
talk
in
a
loud
voice
to
the
other
officers
our
two
young
bodyguards
took
very
little
part
in
the
conversation
among
the
others
was
a
tall
affected
young
man
whom
they
addressed
as
baron
he
was
slender
very
elegant
and
very
strong
when
he
saw
that
we
did
not
understand
german
he
spoke
to
us
in
english
but
soubise
was
too
timid
to
answer
and
i
speak
english
very
badly
he
therefore
resigned
himself
regretfully
to
talking
french
he
was
agreeable
too
agreeable
he
certainly
had
not
bad
manners
but
he
was
deficient
in
tact
i
made
him
understand
this
by
turning
my
face
towards
the
scenery
we
were
passing
we
were
very
much
absorbed
in
our
thoughts
and
had
been
travelling
for
a
long
time
when
i
suddenly
felt
suffocated
by
smoke
which
was
filling
the
carriage
i
looked
round
and
saw
that
the
had
lighted
his
pipe
and
with
his
eyes
half
closed
was
sending
up
puffs
of
smoke
to
the
ceiling
my
eyes
were
smarting
and
i
was
choking
with
indignation
so
much
so
that
i
was
seized
with
a
fit
of
coughing
which
i
exaggerated
in
order
to
attract
the
attention
of
the
impolite
man
the
baron
however
slapped
him
on
the
knee
and
endeavoured
to
make
him
comprehend
that
the
smoke
inconvenienced
me
he
answered
by
an
insult
which
i
did
not
understand
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
continued
to
smoke
exasperated
by
this
i
lowered
the
window
on
my
side
the
intense
cold
made
itself
felt
in
the
carriage
but
i
preferred
that
to
the
nauseous
smoke
of
the
pipe
suddenly
the
got
up
putting
his
hand
to
his
ear
which
i
then
saw
was
filled
with
he
swore
like
an
and
pushing
past
every
one
and
stepping
on
my
feet
and
on
he
shut
the
window
violently
cursing
and
swearing
all
the
time
quite
uselessly
for
i
did
not
understand
him
he
went
back
to
his
seat
continued
his
pipe
and
sent
out
enormous
clouds
of
smoke
in
the
most
insolent
way
the
baron
and
the
two
young
germans
who
had
been
the
first
in
the
carriage
appeared
to
ask
him
something
and
then
to
remonstrate
with
him
but
he
evidently
told
them
to
mind
their
own
business
and
began
to
abuse
them
very
much
calmer
myself
on
seeing
the
increasing
anger
of
the
disagreeable
man
and
very
much
amused
by
his
earache
i
again
opened
the
window
he
got
up
again
furious
showed
me
his
ear
and
his
swollen
cheek
and
i
caught
the
word
in
the
explanation
he
gave
me
on
shutting
the
window
again
and
threatening
me
i
then
made
him
understand
that
i
had
a
weak
chest
and
that
the
smoke
made
me
cough
the
baron
acted
as
my
interpreter
and
explained
this
to
him
but
it
was
easy
to
see
that
he
did
not
care
a
bit
about
that
and
he
once
more
took
up
his
favourite
attitude
and
his
pipe
i
left
him
in
peace
for
five
minutes
during
which
time
he
was
able
to
imagine
himself
triumphant
and
then
with
a
sudden
jerk
of
my
elbow
i
broke
the
pane
of
glass
stupefaction
was
depicted
on
the
face
and
he
became
livid
he
got
straight
up
but
the
two
young
men
rose
at
the
same
time
whilst
the
baron
burst
out
laughing
in
the
most
brutal
manner
the
surgeon
moved
a
step
in
our
direction
but
he
found
a
rampart
before
him
another
officer
had
joined
the
two
young
men
and
he
was
a
strong
fellow
just
cut
out
for
an
obstacle
i
do
not
know
what
he
said
to
the
but
it
was
something
clear
and
decisive
the
latter
not
knowing
how
to
expend
his
anger
turned
on
the
baron
who
was
still
laughing
and
abused
him
so
violently
that
the
latter
calmed
down
suddenly
and
answered
in
such
a
way
that
i
quite
understood
the
two
men
were
calling
each
other
out
that
affected
me
but
little
anyhow
they
might
very
well
kill
each
other
these
two
men
for
they
were
equally
the
carriage
was
now
quiet
and
for
the
wind
blew
in
wildly
through
the
broken
pane
the
sun
had
set
the
sky
was
getting
cloudy
it
was
about
five
and
we
were
approaching
tergnier
the
major
had
changed
seats
with
his
friend
in
order
to
shelter
his
ear
as
much
as
possible
he
kept
moaning
like
a
cow
suddenly
the
repeated
whistling
of
a
distant
locomotive
made
us
listen
attentively
we
then
heard
two
three
and
four
crackers
bursting
under
our
wheels
we
could
perfectly
well
feel
the
efforts
the
was
making
to
slacken
speed
but
before
he
could
succeed
we
were
thrown
against
each
other
by
a
frightful
shock
there
were
cracks
and
creaks
the
hiccoughs
of
the
locomotive
spitting
out
its
smoke
in
irregular
fits
desperate
cries
shouts
oaths
sudden
downfalls
a
lull
then
a
thick
smoke
broken
by
the
flames
of
a
fire
our
carriage
was
standing
up
like
a
horse
kicking
up
its
hind
legs
it
was
impossible
to
get
our
balance
again
who
was
wounded
and
who
was
not
wounded
we
were
nine
in
the
compartment
for
my
part
i
fancied
that
all
my
bones
were
broken
i
moved
one
leg
and
then
i
tried
the
other
then
delighted
at
finding
them
unbroken
i
tried
my
arms
in
the
same
way
i
had
nothing
broken
and
neither
had
soubise
she
had
bitten
her
tongue
and
it
was
bleeding
and
this
had
frightened
me
she
did
not
seem
to
understand
anything
the
tremendous
shaking
had
made
her
dizzy
and
she
lost
her
memory
for
some
days
i
had
a
rather
deep
scratch
between
my
eyes
i
had
not
had
time
to
stretch
out
my
arms
and
my
forehead
had
knocked
against
the
hilt
of
the
sword
which
the
officer
seated
by
soubise
had
been
holding
upright
assistance
arrived
from
all
sides
for
some
time
the
door
of
our
compartment
could
not
be
opened
darkness
had
come
on
when
it
finally
yielded
and
a
lantern
shone
feebly
on
our
poor
carriage
i
looked
round
for
our
one
bag
but
on
finding
it
i
let
it
go
immediately
for
my
hand
was
red
with
blood
whose
blood
was
it
three
men
did
not
move
and
one
of
them
was
the
major
his
face
looked
to
me
livid
i
closed
my
eyes
in
order
not
to
know
and
i
let
the
man
who
had
come
to
our
aid
pull
me
out
of
the
compartment
one
of
the
young
officers
got
out
after
me
he
took
soubise
who
was
almost
in
a
fainting
condition
from
his
friend
the
imbecile
baron
then
got
out
his
shoulder
was
out
of
joint
a
doctor
came
forward
among
the
rescuers
the
baron
held
his
arm
out
to
him
telling
him
at
the
same
time
to
pull
it
which
he
did
at
once
the
french
doctor
took
off
the
cloak
told
two
of
the
to
hold
him
and
then
pushing
against
him
himself
pulled
at
the
poor
arm
the
baron
was
very
pale
and
gave
a
low
whistle
when
the
arm
was
back
in
its
place
the
doctor
shook
the
other
hand
he
said
must
have
hurt
you
very
much
you
are
most
the
german
saluted
and
i
helped
him
on
again
with
his
cloak
the
doctor
was
then
fetched
away
and
i
saw
that
he
was
taken
back
to
our
compartment
i
shuddered
in
spite
of
myself
we
were
now
able
to
find
out
what
had
been
the
cause
of
our
accident
a
locomotive
attached
to
two
vans
of
coal
had
been
shunting
on
to
a
side
line
in
order
to
let
us
pass
when
one
of
the
vans
got
off
the
rails
and
the
locomotive
tired
its
lungs
with
whistling
the
alarm
whilst
men
ran
to
meet
us
scattering
crackers
everything
had
been
in
vain
and
we
had
run
against
the
overturned
van
what
were
we
to
do
the
roads
softened
by
the
recent
wet
weather
were
all
broken
up
by
the
cannons
we
were
about
four
miles
from
tergnier
and
a
thin
penetrating
rain
was
making
our
clothes
stick
to
our
bodies
there
were
four
carriages
but
they
were
for
the
wounded
other
carriages
would
come
but
there
were
the
dead
to
be
carried
away
an
improvised
litter
was
just
being
borne
along
by
two
workmen
the
major
was
lying
on
it
so
livid
that
i
clenched
my
hands
until
my
nails
entered
the
flesh
one
of
the
officers
wanted
to
question
the
doctor
who
was
following
no
i
exclaimed
please
do
not
i
do
not
want
to
know
the
poor
fellow
i
stopped
my
ears
as
though
some
one
was
about
to
shout
out
something
horrible
to
me
and
i
never
knew
his
fate
we
were
obliged
to
resign
ourselves
to
setting
out
on
foot
we
went
about
two
kilometres
as
bravely
as
possible
and
then
i
stopped
quite
exhausted
the
mud
which
clung
to
our
shoes
made
these
very
heavy
the
effort
we
had
to
make
at
every
step
to
get
our
feet
out
of
the
mire
tired
us
out
i
sat
down
on
a
milestone
and
declared
that
i
would
not
go
any
farther
my
sweet
companion
wept
the
two
young
german
officers
who
had
acted
as
bodyguards
made
a
seat
for
me
by
crossing
their
hands
and
so
we
went
nearly
another
mile
my
companion
could
not
walk
any
farther
i
offered
her
my
place
but
she
refused
it
then
let
us
wait
here
i
said
and
quite
at
the
end
of
our
strength
we
rested
against
a
little
broken
tree
it
was
now
night
and
such
a
cold
night
soubise
and
i
huddled
close
together
trying
to
keep
each
other
warm
i
began
to
fall
asleep
seeing
before
my
eyes
the
wounded
men
of
châtillon
who
had
died
seated
against
the
little
shrubs
i
did
not
want
to
move
again
and
the
torpor
seemed
to
me
thoroughly
delicious
a
cart
passed
by
however
on
its
way
to
tergnier
one
of
the
young
men
hailed
it
and
when
a
price
was
agreed
upon
i
felt
myself
picked
up
from
the
ground
lifted
into
the
vehicle
and
carried
along
by
the
jerky
rolling
movement
of
two
loose
wheels
which
climbed
the
hills
sank
into
the
mire
and
jumped
over
the
heaps
of
stones
whilst
the
driver
whipped
up
his
beasts
and
urged
them
on
with
his
voice
he
had
a
care
let
what
will
way
of
driving
which
was
characteristic
of
those
days
i
was
aware
of
all
this
in
my
for
i
was
not
really
asleep
but
i
did
not
want
to
answer
any
questions
i
gave
myself
up
to
this
prostration
of
my
whole
being
with
a
certain
amount
of
enjoyment
a
rough
jerk
however
indicated
that
we
had
arrived
at
tergnier
the
cart
had
drawn
up
at
the
hotel
and
we
had
to
get
out
i
pretended
to
be
still
sleeping
heavily
but
it
was
no
use
for
i
had
to
wake
up
the
two
young
men
helped
me
up
to
my
room
i
asked
soubise
to
arrange
about
the
payment
of
the
cart
before
the
departure
of
our
excellent
young
companions
who
were
sorry
to
leave
us
i
signed
for
each
of
them
a
voucher
on
a
sheet
of
the
hotel
paper
for
a
photograph
only
one
of
them
ever
claimed
it
this
was
six
years
later
and
i
sent
it
to
him
the
tergnier
hotel
could
only
give
us
one
room
i
let
soubise
go
to
bed
and
i
slept
in
an
dressed
as
i
was
the
following
morning
i
asked
about
a
train
for
cateau
but
was
told
that
there
was
no
train
we
had
to
work
marvels
to
procure
a
vehicle
but
finally
meunier
or
mesnier
agreed
to
lend
us
a
conveyance
that
was
something
but
there
was
no
horse
the
poor
horse
had
been
requisitioned
by
the
enemy
a
wheelwright
for
an
exorbitant
price
let
me
have
a
colt
that
had
never
been
in
the
shafts
and
which
went
wild
when
the
harness
was
put
on
the
poor
little
beast
calmed
down
after
being
well
lashed
but
his
wildness
then
changed
into
stubbornness
he
stood
still
on
his
four
legs
which
were
trembling
furiously
and
refused
to
move
with
his
neck
stretched
towards
the
ground
his
eye
fixed
and
his
nostrils
dilating
he
would
not
budge
any
more
than
a
stake
in
the
earth
two
men
then
held
the
light
carriage
back
the
halter
was
taken
off
the
neck
he
shook
his
head
for
an
instant
and
thinking
himself
free
and
without
any
impediments
began
to
advance
the
men
were
scarcely
holding
the
vehicle
he
gave
two
little
kicks
and
then
began
to
trot
oh
it
was
only
a
very
short
trot
a
boy
then
stopped
him
some
carrots
were
given
to
him
his
mane
was
stroked
and
the
halter
was
put
on
again
he
stopped
suddenly
but
the
boy
jumping
into
the
gig
and
holding
the
reins
lightly
spoke
to
him
and
encouraged
him
to
move
on
the
colt
not
feeling
any
resistance
began
to
trot
along
for
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
and
then
came
back
to
us
at
the
door
of
the
hotel
i
had
to
leave
a
deposit
of
four
hundred
francs
with
the
notary
of
the
place
in
case
the
colt
should
die
ah
what
a
journey
that
was
with
the
boy
soubise
and
me
sitting
close
together
in
that
little
gig
the
wheels
of
which
creaked
at
every
jolt
the
unhappy
colt
was
steaming
like
a
when
the
lid
is
raised
we
started
at
eleven
in
the
morning
and
when
we
had
to
stop
because
the
poor
beast
could
not
go
any
farther
it
was
five
in
the
afternoon
and
we
had
not
gone
five
miles
oh
that
poor
colt
he
was
certainly
to
be
pitied
we
were
not
very
heavy
all
three
of
us
together
but
we
were
too
much
for
him
we
were
just
a
few
yards
away
from
a
house
i
knocked
and
an
old
woman
enormous
in
size
opened
the
door
do
you
want
she
asked
for
an
hour
and
shelter
for
our
she
looked
out
on
to
the
road
and
saw
our
father
she
called
out
in
a
husky
voice
and
look
here
a
stout
man
quite
as
stout
as
she
was
but
older
came
hobbling
heavily
along
she
pointed
to
the
gig
so
oddly
equipped
and
he
burst
out
laughing
and
said
to
me
in
an
insolent
way
what
do
you
want
i
repeated
my
phrase
for
an
hour
we
can
do
it
but
want
paying
i
showed
him
twenty
francs
the
old
woman
gave
him
a
nudge
but
in
these
times
you
know
well
worth
forty
good
i
said
forty
he
then
let
me
go
inside
the
house
with
mlle
soubise
and
sent
his
son
towards
the
boy
who
was
coming
along
holding
the
colt
by
his
mane
he
had
taken
off
the
halter
very
considerately
and
thrown
my
rug
over
its
steaming
sides
on
reaching
the
house
the
poor
beast
was
quickly
unharnessed
and
taken
into
a
little
enclosure
at
the
far
end
of
which
a
few
planks
served
as
a
stable
for
an
old
mule
which
was
aroused
by
the
fat
woman
with
kicks
and
turned
out
into
the
enclosure
the
colt
took
its
place
and
when
i
asked
for
some
oats
for
it
she
replied
we
could
get
it
some
but
that
included
in
the
forty
well
i
said
and
i
gave
our
boy
five
francs
to
fetch
the
oats
but
the
old
shrew
took
the
money
from
him
and
handed
it
to
her
lad
saying
go
you
know
where
to
find
them
and
come
back
our
boy
remained
with
the
colt
drying
it
and
rubbing
it
down
as
well
as
he
could
i
went
back
to
the
house
where
i
found
my
charming
soubise
with
her
sleeves
turned
up
and
her
delicate
hands
washing
two
glasses
and
two
plates
for
us
i
asked
if
it
would
be
possible
to
have
some
eggs
but
i
interrupted
our
monstrous
hostess
tire
yourself
madame
i
beg
i
said
is
understood
that
the
forty
francs
are
your
tip
and
that
i
am
to
pay
for
everything
she
was
confused
for
a
moment
shaking
her
head
and
trying
to
find
words
but
i
asked
her
to
give
me
the
eggs
she
brought
me
five
eggs
and
i
began
to
make
an
omelette
as
my
culinary
glory
is
an
omelette
the
water
was
nauseous
so
we
drank
cider
i
sent
for
the
boy
and
made
them
serve
him
something
to
eat
in
our
presence
for
i
was
afraid
that
the
ogress
would
give
him
too
economical
a
meal
when
i
paid
the
fabulous
bill
of
francs
inclusive
of
course
of
the
forty
francs
the
matron
put
on
her
spectacles
and
taking
one
of
the
gold
pieces
looked
at
it
on
one
side
then
on
the
other
made
it
ring
on
a
plate
and
then
on
the
ground
she
did
this
with
each
of
the
three
gold
pieces
i
could
not
help
laughing
nothing
to
laugh
at
she
grunted
the
last
six
months
had
nothing
but
thieves
you
know
something
about
theft
i
said
she
looked
at
me
trying
to
make
out
what
i
meant
but
the
laughing
expression
in
my
eyes
took
away
her
suspicions
this
was
very
fortunate
as
they
were
people
capable
of
doing
us
harm
i
had
taken
the
precaution
when
sitting
down
to
table
of
putting
my
revolver
near
me
know
how
to
fire
that
asked
the
lame
man
yes
i
shoot
very
well
i
answered
though
it
was
not
true
our
steed
was
then
put
in
again
in
a
few
seconds
and
we
proceeded
on
our
way
the
colt
appeared
to
be
quite
joyful
he
stamped
kicked
a
little
and
began
to
go
at
a
pretty
steady
pace
our
disagreeable
hosts
had
indicated
the
way
to
quentin
and
we
set
off
after
our
poor
colt
had
made
various
attempts
at
standing
still
i
was
dead
tired
and
fell
asleep
but
after
about
an
hour
the
vehicle
stopped
abruptly
and
the
wretched
beast
began
to
snort
and
put
his
back
up
supporting
himself
on
his
four
stiff
trembling
legs
it
had
been
a
gloomy
day
and
a
lowering
sky
full
of
tears
seemed
to
be
falling
slowly
over
the
earth
we
had
stopped
in
the
middle
of
a
field
which
had
been
ploughed
up
all
over
by
the
heavy
wheels
of
cannons
the
rest
of
the
ground
had
been
trampled
by
feet
and
the
cold
had
hardened
the
little
ridges
of
earth
leaving
icicles
here
and
there
which
glittered
dismally
in
the
thick
atmosphere
we
got
down
from
the
vehicle
to
try
to
discover
what
was
making
our
little
animal
tremble
in
this
way
i
gave
a
cry
of
horror
for
only
about
five
yards
away
some
dogs
were
pulling
wildly
at
a
dead
body
half
of
which
was
still
underground
it
was
a
soldier
and
fortunately
one
of
the
enemy
i
took
the
whip
from
our
young
driver
and
lashed
the
horrid
animals
as
hard
as
i
could
they
moved
away
for
a
second
showing
their
teeth
and
then
returned
to
their
voracious
and
abominable
work
growling
sullenly
at
us
our
boy
got
down
and
led
the
snorting
pony
by
the
bridle
we
went
on
with
some
difficulty
trying
to
find
the
road
in
these
devastated
plains
darkness
came
over
us
and
it
was
icy
cold
the
moon
feebly
pushed
aside
her
veils
and
shone
over
the
landscape
with
a
wan
sad
light
i
was
half
dead
with
fright
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
silence
was
broken
by
cries
from
underground
and
every
little
mound
of
earth
appeared
to
me
to
be
a
head
mlle
soubise
was
crying
with
her
face
hidden
in
her
hands
after
going
along
for
half
an
hour
we
saw
in
the
distance
a
little
group
of
people
coming
along
carrying
lanterns
i
went
towards
them
as
i
wanted
to
find
out
which
way
to
go
i
was
embarrassed
on
getting
nearer
to
them
for
i
could
hear
sobs
i
saw
a
poor
woman
who
was
very
corpulent
being
helped
along
by
a
young
priest
the
whole
of
her
body
was
shaken
by
her
fits
of
grief
she
was
followed
by
two
and
by
three
other
persons
i
let
her
pass
by
and
then
questioned
those
who
were
following
her
i
was
told
that
she
was
looking
for
the
bodies
of
her
husband
and
son
who
had
both
been
killed
a
few
days
before
on
the
quentin
plains
she
came
each
day
at
dusk
in
order
to
avoid
general
curiosity
but
she
had
not
yet
met
with
any
success
it
was
hoped
that
she
would
find
them
this
time
as
one
of
these
who
had
just
left
the
hospital
was
taking
her
to
the
spot
where
he
had
seen
the
poor
husband
fall
mortally
wounded
he
had
fallen
there
himself
and
had
been
picked
up
by
the
ambulance
people
i
thanked
these
persons
who
showed
me
the
sad
road
we
must
take
the
best
one
there
was
through
the
cemetery
which
was
still
warm
under
the
ice
we
could
now
distinguish
groups
of
people
searching
about
and
it
was
all
so
horrible
that
it
made
me
want
to
scream
out
suddenly
the
boy
who
was
driving
us
pulled
my
madame
he
said
at
that
scoundrel
i
looked
and
saw
a
man
lying
down
full
length
with
a
large
bag
near
him
he
had
a
dark
lantern
which
he
held
towards
the
ground
he
then
got
up
looked
round
him
for
his
outline
could
be
seen
distinctly
on
the
horizon
and
began
his
work
again
when
he
caught
sight
of
us
he
put
out
his
lamp
and
crouched
down
on
the
ground
we
walked
on
in
silence
straight
towards
him
i
took
the
colt
by
the
bridle
on
the
other
side
and
the
boy
no
doubt
understood
what
i
intended
to
do
for
he
let
me
lead
the
way
i
walked
straight
towards
the
man
pretending
not
to
know
he
was
there
the
colt
backed
but
we
pulled
hard
and
made
it
advance
we
were
so
near
to
the
man
that
i
shuddered
at
the
thought
that
the
wretch
would
perhaps
allow
himself
to
be
trampled
over
by
the
animal
and
the
light
vehicle
rather
than
reveal
his
presence
fortunately
i
was
mistaken
a
stifled
voice
murmured
care
there
i
am
wounded
you
will
run
over
i
took
the
gig
lantern
down
we
had
covered
it
with
a
jacket
as
the
moon
lighted
us
better
and
i
now
turned
it
on
the
face
of
this
wretch
i
was
stupefied
to
see
a
man
of
from
to
seventy
years
of
age
with
a
face
framed
with
long
dirty
white
whiskers
he
had
a
muffler
round
his
neck
and
was
wearing
a
cloak
of
a
dark
colour
around
him
shown
up
by
the
moon
were
sword
belts
brass
buttons
sword
hilts
and
other
objects
that
the
infamous
old
fellow
had
torn
from
the
poor
dead
are
not
wounded
you
are
a
thief
and
a
violator
of
tombs
i
shall
call
out
and
you
will
be
killed
do
you
hear
that
you
miserable
wretch
i
exclaimed
and
i
went
so
near
to
him
that
i
could
feel
his
breath
sully
mine
he
crouched
down
on
his
knees
and
clasping
his
criminal
hands
implored
me
in
a
trembling
tearful
voice
your
bag
there
then
i
said
all
those
things
empty
your
pockets
leave
everything
and
go
run
for
as
soon
as
you
are
out
of
sight
i
shall
call
one
of
those
soldiers
who
are
making
searches
and
give
them
your
plunder
i
know
i
am
doing
wrong
though
in
letting
you
go
he
emptied
his
pockets
groaning
all
the
time
and
was
just
going
away
when
the
lad
whispered
hiding
some
boots
under
his
i
was
furious
with
rage
with
this
vile
thief
and
i
pulled
his
big
cloak
off
everything
you
wretched
man
i
exclaimed
i
will
call
the
six
pairs
of
boots
taken
from
the
corpses
fell
noisily
on
to
the
hard
ground
the
man
stooped
down
for
his
revolver
which
he
had
taken
out
of
his
pocket
at
the
same
time
as
the
stolen
objects
you
leave
that
and
get
away
quickly
i
said
patience
is
at
an
if
i
am
caught
i
be
able
to
defend
myself
he
exclaimed
in
a
fit
of
desperate
rage
will
be
because
god
willed
it
so
i
answered
at
once
or
i
will
the
man
then
made
off
abusing
me
as
he
went
our
little
driver
then
fetched
a
soldier
to
whom
i
related
the
adventure
showing
him
the
objects
way
did
the
rascal
go
asked
a
sergeant
who
had
come
with
the
soldier
say
i
replied
well
i
care
to
run
after
him
he
said
are
enough
dead
men
we
continued
our
way
until
we
came
to
a
place
where
several
roads
met
and
it
was
then
possible
for
us
to
take
a
route
a
little
more
suitable
for
vehicles
after
going
through
busigny
and
a
wood
where
there
were
bogs
in
which
we
only
just
escaped
being
swallowed
up
our
painful
journey
came
to
an
end
and
we
arrived
at
cateau
in
the
night
half
dead
with
fatigue
fright
and
despair
i
was
obliged
to
take
a
rest
there
for
i
was
prostrate
with
feverishness
we
had
two
little
rooms
roughly
but
quite
clean
the
floor
was
of
red
shiny
bricks
and
there
was
a
polished
wood
bed
and
white
curtains
i
sent
for
a
doctor
for
my
charming
little
soubise
who
it
seemed
to
me
was
worse
than
i
was
he
thought
we
were
both
in
a
very
bad
state
though
a
nervous
feverishness
had
taken
all
the
use
out
of
my
limbs
and
made
my
head
burn
she
could
not
keep
still
but
kept
seeing
spectres
and
fires
hearing
shouts
and
turning
round
quickly
imagining
that
some
one
had
touched
her
on
the
shoulder
the
good
man
gave
us
a
soothing
draught
to
overcome
our
fatigue
and
the
next
day
a
very
hot
bath
brought
back
the
suppleness
to
our
limbs
it
was
then
six
days
since
we
had
left
paris
and
it
would
take
about
twenty
more
hours
to
reach
homburg
for
in
those
days
trains
went
much
less
quickly
than
at
present
i
took
a
train
for
brussels
where
i
was
counting
on
buying
a
trunk
and
a
few
necessary
things
from
cateau
to
brussels
there
was
no
hindrance
to
our
journey
and
we
were
able
to
take
the
train
again
the
same
evening
i
had
replenished
our
wardrobe
which
certainly
needed
it
and
we
continued
our
journey
without
much
difficulty
as
far
as
cologne
but
on
arriving
in
that
city
we
had
a
cruel
disappointment
the
train
had
only
just
entered
the
station
when
a
railway
official
passing
quickly
in
front
of
the
carriages
shouted
something
in
german
which
i
did
not
catch
every
one
seemed
to
be
in
a
hurry
and
men
and
women
pushed
each
other
without
any
courtesy
i
addressed
another
official
and
showed
him
our
tickets
he
took
up
my
bag
very
obligingly
and
hurried
after
the
crowd
we
followed
but
i
did
not
understand
the
excitement
until
the
man
flung
my
bag
into
a
compartment
and
signed
to
me
to
get
in
as
quickly
as
possible
soubise
was
already
on
the
step
when
she
was
pushed
aside
violently
by
a
railway
porter
who
slammed
the
door
and
before
i
was
fully
aware
of
what
had
happened
the
train
had
disappeared
my
bag
had
gone
and
our
trunk
also
the
trunk
had
been
placed
in
a
luggage
van
that
had
been
unhooked
from
the
train
which
had
just
arrived
and
immediately
fastened
on
to
the
express
now
departing
i
began
to
cry
with
rage
an
official
took
pity
on
us
and
led
us
to
the
he
was
a
very
superior
sort
of
man
who
spoke
french
fairly
well
i
sank
down
in
his
great
leather
and
told
him
my
misadventure
sobbing
nervously
he
looked
kind
and
sympathetic
he
immediately
telegraphed
for
my
bag
and
trunk
to
be
given
into
the
care
of
the
at
the
first
station
will
have
them
again
towards
he
said
i
can
not
start
this
evening
i
asked
no
that
is
impossible
he
replied
is
no
train
for
the
express
that
will
take
you
to
homburg
does
not
start
before
god
god
i
exclaimed
and
i
was
seized
with
veritable
despair
which
soon
affected
mlle
soubise
too
the
poor
was
rather
embarrassed
and
tried
to
soothe
me
you
know
any
one
here
he
asked
no
one
i
do
not
know
any
one
in
then
i
will
have
you
driven
to
the
hôtel
du
nord
my
has
been
there
for
two
days
and
she
will
look
after
half
an
hour
later
his
carriage
arrived
and
he
took
us
to
the
hôtel
du
nord
after
driving
a
long
way
round
to
show
us
the
city
but
at
that
epoch
i
did
not
admire
anything
belonging
to
the
germans
on
arriving
at
the
hôtel
du
nord
he
introduced
us
to
his
a
young
woman
pretty
but
too
tall
and
too
big
for
my
taste
i
must
say
though
that
she
was
very
sweet
and
affable
she
engaged
two
bedrooms
for
us
near
her
own
rooms
she
had
a
flat
on
the
ground
floor
and
she
invited
us
to
dinner
which
was
served
in
her
her
joined
us
in
the
evening
the
charming
woman
was
very
musical
she
played
to
us
from
berlioz
gounod
and
even
auber
i
thoroughly
appreciated
the
delicacy
of
this
woman
in
only
letting
us
hear
french
composers
i
asked
her
to
play
us
something
from
mozart
and
wagner
at
that
name
she
turned
to
me
and
exclaimed
you
like
wagner
like
his
music
i
replied
i
detest
the
mlle
soubise
whispered
to
me
her
to
play
she
overheard
and
complied
with
infinite
graciousness
i
must
admit
that
i
spent
a
delightful
evening
there
at
ten
the
whose
name
i
have
very
stupidly
forgotten
and
i
can
not
find
it
in
any
of
my
notes
told
me
that
he
would
call
for
us
at
eight
the
following
morning
and
he
then
took
leave
of
us
i
fell
asleep
lulled
by
mozart
gounod
at
eight
the
next
morning
a
servant
came
to
tell
me
that
the
carriage
was
waiting
for
us
there
was
a
gentle
knock
at
my
door
and
our
beautiful
hostess
of
the
previous
evening
said
sweetly
you
must
start
i
was
really
very
much
touched
by
the
delicacy
of
the
pretty
german
woman
it
was
such
a
fine
day
that
i
asked
her
if
we
should
have
time
to
walk
there
and
on
her
reply
in
the
affirmative
we
all
three
started
for
the
station
which
is
not
far
from
the
hotel
a
special
compartment
had
been
reserved
for
us
and
we
installed
ourselves
in
it
as
comfortably
as
possible
the
brother
and
sister
shook
hands
with
us
and
wished
us
a
pleasant
journey
when
the
train
had
started
i
discovered
in
one
of
the
corners
a
bouquet
of
with
the
card
and
a
box
of
chocolates
from
the
i
was
at
last
about
to
arrive
at
my
goal
and
was
in
a
state
of
wild
excitement
at
the
idea
of
seeing
once
more
all
my
beloved
ones
i
should
have
liked
to
have
gone
to
sleep
my
eyes
which
had
grown
larger
with
anxiety
travelled
through
space
more
rapidly
than
the
train
went
i
fumed
each
time
it
stopped
and
envied
the
birds
i
saw
flying
along
i
laughed
with
delight
as
i
thought
of
the
surprised
faces
of
those
i
was
going
to
see
again
and
then
i
began
to
tremble
with
anxiety
what
had
happened
to
them
and
should
i
find
them
all
i
should
if
ah
those
those
and
those
my
mind
became
full
of
them
they
bristled
with
illnesses
and
accidents
and
i
began
to
weep
my
poor
little
travelling
companion
began
to
weep
too
finally
we
came
within
sight
of
homburg
twenty
more
minutes
of
this
turning
of
wheels
and
we
should
enter
the
station
but
just
as
though
all
the
sprites
and
devils
from
the
infernal
regions
had
concerted
to
torture
my
patience
we
stopped
short
all
heads
were
out
of
the
windows
is
it
the
matter
are
we
not
going
on
there
was
a
train
in
front
of
us
at
a
standstill
with
a
broken
brake
and
the
line
had
to
be
cleared
i
fell
back
on
my
seat
clenching
my
teeth
and
hands
and
looking
up
in
the
air
to
distinguish
the
evil
spirits
which
were
so
bent
on
tormenting
me
and
then
i
resolutely
closed
my
eyes
i
muttered
some
invectives
against
the
invisible
sprites
and
declared
that
as
i
would
not
suffer
any
more
i
was
now
going
to
sleep
i
then
fell
fast
asleep
for
the
power
of
sleeping
when
i
wish
is
a
precious
gift
which
god
has
bestowed
on
me
in
the
most
frightful
circumstances
and
the
most
cruel
moments
of
life
when
i
have
felt
that
my
reason
was
giving
way
under
shocks
that
have
been
too
great
or
too
painful
my
will
has
laid
hold
of
my
reason
just
as
one
holds
a
little
dog
that
wants
to
bite
and
subjugating
it
my
will
has
said
to
my
reason
you
can
take
up
again
your
suffering
and
your
plans
your
anxiety
your
sorrow
and
your
anguish
you
have
had
enough
for
you
would
give
way
altogether
under
the
weight
of
so
many
troubles
and
you
would
drag
me
along
with
you
i
will
not
have
it
we
will
forget
everything
for
so
many
hours
and
go
to
sleep
together
and
i
have
gone
to
sleep
this
i
swear
to
mlle
soubise
roused
me
as
soon
as
the
train
entered
the
station
i
was
refreshed
and
calmer
a
minute
later
we
were
in
a
carriage
and
had
given
the
address
ober
strasse
we
were
soon
there
and
i
found
all
my
adored
ones
big
and
little
and
they
were
all
very
well
oh
what
happiness
it
was
the
blood
pulsed
in
all
my
arteries
i
had
suffered
so
much
that
i
burst
out
into
delicious
laughter
and
sobs
who
can
ever
describe
the
infinite
pleasure
of
tears
of
joy
during
the
next
two
days
the
maddest
things
occurred
which
i
will
not
relate
so
incredible
would
they
sound
among
others
fire
broke
out
in
the
house
we
had
to
escape
in
our
night
clothes
and
camp
out
for
six
hours
in
five
feet
of
snow
xix
my
return
to
paris
the
commune
at
everybody
being
safe
and
sound
we
set
out
for
paris
but
on
arriving
at
denis
we
found
there
were
no
more
trains
it
was
four
in
the
morning
the
germans
were
masters
of
all
the
suburbs
of
paris
and
trains
only
ran
for
their
service
after
an
hour
spent
in
running
about
in
discussions
and
rebuffs
i
met
with
an
officer
of
higher
rank
who
was
better
educated
and
more
agreeable
he
had
a
locomotive
prepared
to
take
me
to
the
gare
du
hâvre
gare
lazare
the
journey
was
very
amusing
my
mother
my
aunt
my
sister
régina
mlle
soubise
the
two
maids
the
children
and
i
all
squeezed
into
a
little
square
space
in
which
there
was
a
very
small
narrow
bench
which
i
think
was
the
place
for
the
signalman
in
those
days
the
engine
went
very
slowly
as
the
rails
were
frequently
obstructed
by
carts
or
railway
carriages
we
left
at
five
in
the
morning
and
arrived
at
seven
at
a
place
which
i
can
not
locate
our
german
conductors
were
exchanged
for
french
conductors
i
questioned
them
and
learnt
that
revolutionary
troubles
were
beginning
in
paris
the
stoker
with
whom
i
was
talking
was
a
very
intelligent
and
very
advanced
individual
would
do
better
to
go
somewhere
else
and
not
to
paris
he
said
before
long
they
will
come
to
blows
we
had
arrived
but
as
no
train
was
expected
in
at
that
hour
it
was
impossible
to
find
a
carriage
i
got
down
with
my
tribe
from
the
locomotive
to
the
great
amazement
of
the
station
officials
i
was
no
longer
very
rich
but
i
offered
twenty
francs
to
one
of
the
men
if
he
would
see
to
our
six
bags
we
were
to
send
for
my
trunk
and
those
belonging
to
my
family
later
on
there
was
not
a
single
carriage
outside
the
station
the
children
were
very
tired
but
what
was
to
be
done
i
was
then
living
at
no
rue
de
rome
and
this
was
not
far
away
but
my
mother
scarcely
ever
walked
for
she
was
delicate
and
had
a
weak
heart
the
children
too
were
very
very
tired
their
eyes
were
puffed
up
and
scarcely
open
and
their
little
limbs
were
benumbed
by
the
cold
and
immobility
i
began
to
get
desperate
but
a
milk
cart
was
just
passing
by
and
i
sent
a
porter
to
hail
it
i
offered
twenty
francs
if
the
man
would
drive
my
mother
and
the
two
children
to
rue
de
rome
you
too
if
you
like
young
lady
said
the
milkman
are
thinner
than
a
grasshopper
and
you
make
it
any
i
did
not
want
inviting
twice
although
rather
annoyed
by
the
speech
when
once
my
mother
was
installed
in
spite
of
her
hesitation
by
the
side
of
the
milkman
and
the
children
and
i
were
in
amongst
the
full
and
empty
i
said
to
our
driver
you
mind
coming
back
to
fetch
the
others
i
pointed
to
the
remaining
group
and
added
shall
have
twenty
francs
you
are
said
the
worthy
fellow
good
work
you
tire
your
legs
you
others
be
back
for
you
directly
he
then
whipped
up
his
horse
and
we
started
at
a
wild
rate
the
children
rolled
about
and
i
held
on
my
mother
set
her
teeth
and
did
not
utter
a
word
but
from
under
her
long
lashes
she
glanced
at
me
with
a
displeased
look
on
arriving
at
my
door
the
milkman
drew
up
his
horse
so
sharply
that
i
thought
my
mother
would
have
fallen
out
on
to
the
back
we
had
arrived
though
and
we
got
out
the
cart
started
off
again
at
full
speed
my
mother
would
not
speak
to
me
for
about
an
hour
poor
pretty
mother
it
was
not
my
fault
i
had
gone
away
from
paris
eleven
days
before
and
had
then
left
a
sad
city
the
sadness
had
been
painful
the
result
of
a
great
and
unexpected
misfortune
no
one
had
dared
to
look
up
fearing
to
be
blown
upon
by
the
same
wind
which
was
blowing
the
german
flag
floating
yonder
towards
the
arc
de
triomphe
i
now
found
paris
effervescent
and
grumbling
the
walls
were
placarded
with
posters
and
all
these
posters
contained
the
wildest
harangues
fine
noble
ideas
were
side
by
side
with
absurd
threats
workmen
on
their
way
to
their
daily
toil
stopped
in
front
of
these
bills
one
would
read
aloud
and
the
gathering
crowd
would
begin
to
read
over
again
and
all
these
human
beings
who
had
just
been
suffering
so
much
through
this
abominable
war
now
echoed
these
appeals
for
vengeance
they
were
very
much
to
be
excused
this
war
alas
had
hollowed
out
under
their
very
feet
a
gulf
of
ruin
and
of
mourning
poverty
had
brought
the
women
to
rags
the
privations
of
the
siege
had
lowered
the
vitality
of
the
children
and
the
shame
of
the
defeat
had
discouraged
the
men
well
these
appeals
to
rebellion
these
anarchist
shouts
these
yells
from
the
crowd
shrieking
with
thrones
down
with
the
republic
down
with
the
rich
down
with
the
priests
down
with
the
jews
down
with
the
army
down
with
the
masters
down
with
those
who
work
down
with
everything
all
these
cries
roused
the
benumbed
hearers
the
germans
who
fomented
all
these
riots
rendered
us
a
real
service
without
intending
it
those
who
had
given
themselves
up
to
resignation
were
stirred
out
of
their
torpor
others
who
demanded
revenge
found
an
aliment
for
their
inactive
forces
none
of
them
agreed
there
were
ten
or
twenty
different
parties
devouring
each
other
and
threatening
each
other
it
was
terrible
but
it
was
the
awakening
it
was
life
after
death
i
had
among
my
friends
about
ten
of
the
leaders
of
different
opinions
and
all
of
them
interested
me
the
maddest
and
the
wisest
of
them
i
often
saw
gambetta
at
and
it
was
a
joy
to
me
to
listen
to
this
admirable
man
what
he
said
was
so
wise
so
and
so
captivating
this
man
with
his
heavy
stomach
his
short
arms
and
huge
head
had
a
halo
of
beauty
round
him
when
he
spoke
gambetta
was
never
common
never
ordinary
he
took
snuff
and
the
gesture
of
his
hand
when
he
brushed
away
the
stray
grains
was
full
of
grace
he
smoked
huge
cigars
but
could
smoke
them
without
inconveniencing
any
one
when
he
was
tired
of
politics
and
talked
literature
it
was
a
real
charm
for
he
knew
everything
and
quoted
poetry
admirably
one
evening
after
a
dinner
at
we
played
together
the
whole
scene
of
the
first
act
of
with
dona
sol
and
if
he
was
not
as
handsome
as
he
was
just
as
admirable
in
it
on
another
occasion
he
recited
the
whole
of
and
boaz
commencing
with
the
last
verse
but
i
preferred
his
political
discussions
especially
when
he
criticised
the
speech
of
some
one
who
was
of
the
opposite
opinion
to
himself
the
eminent
qualities
of
this
talent
were
logic
and
weight
and
his
seductive
force
was
his
chauvinism
the
early
death
of
so
great
a
thinker
is
a
disconcerting
challenge
flung
at
human
pride
i
sometimes
saw
rochefort
whose
wit
delighted
me
i
was
not
at
ease
with
him
though
for
he
was
the
cause
of
the
fall
of
the
empire
and
although
i
am
very
republican
i
liked
the
emperor
napoleon
iii
he
had
been
too
trustful
but
very
unfortunate
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
rochefort
insulted
him
too
much
after
his
misfortune
i
also
frequently
saw
paul
de
rémusat
the
favourite
of
thiers
he
had
great
refinement
of
mind
broad
ideas
and
fascinating
manners
some
people
accused
him
of
orleanism
he
was
a
republican
and
a
much
more
advanced
republican
than
thiers
one
must
have
known
him
very
little
to
believe
him
to
be
anything
else
but
what
he
said
he
was
paul
de
rémusat
had
a
horror
of
untruth
he
was
sensitive
and
had
a
very
straightforward
strong
character
he
took
no
active
part
in
politics
except
in
private
circles
and
his
advice
always
prevailed
even
in
the
chamber
and
in
the
senate
he
would
never
speak
except
when
in
committee
the
ministry
of
fine
arts
was
offered
to
him
a
hundred
times
but
he
refused
it
a
hundred
times
finally
after
my
repeated
entreaties
he
almost
allowed
himself
to
be
appointed
minister
of
fine
arts
but
at
the
last
moment
he
declined
and
wrote
me
a
delightful
letter
from
which
i
quote
a
few
passages
as
the
letter
was
not
written
for
publication
i
do
not
consider
that
i
have
a
right
to
give
the
whole
of
it
but
there
seems
to
be
no
harm
in
publishing
these
few
lines
me
my
charming
friend
to
remain
in
the
shade
i
can
see
better
there
than
in
the
dazzling
brilliancy
of
honours
you
are
grateful
to
me
sometimes
for
being
attentive
to
the
miseries
you
point
out
to
me
let
me
keep
my
independence
it
is
more
agreeable
to
me
to
have
the
right
to
relieve
every
one
than
to
be
obliged
to
relieve
no
matter
whom
in
matters
of
art
i
have
made
for
myself
an
ideal
of
beauty
which
would
naturally
seem
too
partial
it
is
a
great
pity
that
the
scruples
of
this
man
did
not
allow
him
to
accept
this
office
the
reforms
that
he
pointed
out
to
me
were
and
still
are
very
necessary
ones
however
that
can
not
be
helped
i
also
knew
and
frequently
saw
a
mad
sort
of
fellow
full
of
dreams
and
utopian
follies
his
name
was
flourens
and
he
was
tall
and
he
wanted
every
one
to
be
happy
and
every
one
to
have
money
and
he
shot
down
the
soldiers
without
reflecting
that
he
was
commencing
by
making
one
or
more
of
them
unhappy
reasoning
with
him
was
impossible
but
he
was
charming
and
brave
i
saw
him
two
days
before
his
death
he
came
to
see
me
with
a
very
young
girl
who
wanted
to
devote
herself
to
dramatic
art
i
promised
him
to
help
her
two
days
later
the
poor
child
came
to
tell
me
of
the
heroic
death
of
flourens
he
had
refused
to
surrender
and
stretching
out
his
arms
had
shouted
to
the
hesitating
soldiers
shoot
i
should
not
have
spared
you
and
their
bullets
had
killed
him
another
man
not
so
interesting
whom
i
looked
upon
as
a
dangerous
madman
was
a
certain
raoul
rigault
for
a
short
time
he
was
prefect
of
police
he
was
very
young
and
very
daring
wildly
ambitious
determined
to
do
anything
to
succeed
and
it
seemed
to
him
more
easy
to
do
harm
than
good
that
man
was
a
real
danger
he
belonged
to
a
group
of
students
who
used
to
send
me
verses
every
day
i
came
across
them
everywhere
enthusiastic
and
mad
they
had
been
nicknamed
in
paris
the
one
day
he
brought
me
a
little
play
the
piece
was
so
stupid
and
the
verses
were
so
insipid
that
i
sent
it
him
back
with
a
few
words
which
he
no
doubt
considered
unkind
for
he
bore
me
malice
for
them
and
attempted
to
avenge
himself
in
the
following
way
he
called
on
me
one
day
and
madame
guérard
was
there
when
he
was
shown
in
you
know
that
i
am
at
present
he
said
these
days
there
is
nothing
surprising
in
that
i
replied
have
come
to
see
you
either
to
make
peace
or
declare
war
he
continued
this
way
of
talking
did
not
suit
me
and
i
sprang
up
i
can
foresee
that
your
conditions
of
peace
would
not
suit
me
i
will
not
give
you
time
to
declare
war
you
are
one
of
the
men
one
would
prefer
no
matter
how
spiteful
they
might
be
as
enemies
rather
than
with
these
words
i
rang
for
my
footman
to
show
the
prefect
of
police
to
the
door
madame
guérard
was
in
despair
man
will
do
us
some
harm
my
dear
sarah
i
assure
you
she
said
she
was
not
mistaken
in
her
presentiment
except
that
she
was
thinking
of
me
and
not
of
herself
for
his
first
vengeance
was
taken
on
her
by
sending
away
one
of
her
relatives
who
was
a
police
commissioner
to
an
inferior
and
dangerous
post
he
then
began
to
invent
a
hundred
miseries
for
me
one
day
i
received
an
order
to
go
at
once
to
the
prefecture
of
police
on
urgent
business
i
took
no
notice
the
following
day
a
mounted
courier
brought
me
a
note
from
sire
raoul
rigault
threatening
to
send
a
prison
van
for
me
i
took
no
notice
whatever
of
the
threats
of
this
wretch
who
was
shot
shortly
after
and
died
without
showing
any
courage
life
however
was
no
longer
possible
in
paris
and
i
decided
to
go
to
i
asked
my
mother
to
go
with
me
but
she
went
to
switzerland
with
my
youngest
sister
the
departure
from
paris
was
not
as
easy
as
i
had
hoped
communists
with
gun
on
shoulder
stopped
the
trains
and
searched
in
all
our
bags
and
pockets
and
even
under
the
cushions
of
the
railway
carriages
they
were
afraid
that
the
passengers
were
taking
newspapers
to
versailles
this
was
monstrously
stupid
the
installation
at
germain
was
not
an
easy
thing
either
nearly
all
paris
had
taken
refuge
in
this
little
place
which
is
as
pretty
as
it
is
dull
from
the
height
of
the
terrace
where
the
crowd
remained
morning
and
night
we
could
see
the
alarming
progress
of
the
commune
on
all
sides
of
paris
the
flames
rose
proud
and
destructive
the
wind
often
brought
us
burnt
papers
which
we
took
to
the
council
house
the
seine
brought
quantities
along
with
it
and
the
boatmen
collected
these
in
sacks
some
days
and
these
were
the
most
distressing
of
all
an
opaque
veil
of
smoke
enveloped
paris
there
was
no
breeze
to
allow
the
flames
to
pierce
through
the
city
then
burnt
stealthily
without
our
anxious
eyes
being
able
to
discover
the
fresh
buildings
that
these
furious
madmen
had
set
alight
i
went
for
a
ride
every
day
in
the
forest
sometimes
i
would
go
as
far
as
versailles
but
this
was
not
without
danger
we
often
came
across
poor
starving
wretches
in
the
forest
whom
we
joyfully
helped
but
often
too
there
were
prisoners
who
had
escaped
from
poissy
or
communist
sharpshooters
trying
to
shoot
a
versailles
soldier
one
day
on
the
way
back
from
triel
where
captain
and
i
had
been
for
a
gallop
over
the
hills
we
entered
the
forest
rather
late
in
the
evening
as
it
was
a
shorter
way
a
shot
was
fired
from
a
neighbouring
thicket
which
made
my
horse
bound
so
suddenly
towards
the
left
that
i
was
thrown
fortunately
my
horse
was
quiet
hurried
to
me
but
i
was
already
up
and
ready
to
mount
again
a
second
he
said
want
to
search
that
a
short
gallop
soon
brought
him
to
the
spot
and
i
then
heard
a
shot
some
branches
breaking
under
flying
feet
then
another
shot
not
at
all
like
the
two
former
ones
and
my
friend
appeared
again
with
a
pistol
in
his
hand
have
not
been
hit
i
asked
the
first
shot
just
touched
my
leg
but
the
fellow
aimed
too
low
the
second
he
fired
haphazard
i
fancy
though
that
he
has
a
bullet
from
my
revolver
in
his
i
heard
some
one
running
away
i
said
replied
the
elegant
captain
chuckling
will
not
go
wretch
i
murmured
no
exclaimed
not
pity
them
i
beg
they
kill
numbers
of
our
men
every
day
only
yesterday
five
soldiers
from
my
regiment
were
found
on
the
versailles
road
not
only
killed
but
mutilated
and
gnashing
his
teeth
he
finished
his
sentence
with
an
oath
i
turned
towards
him
rather
surprised
but
he
took
no
notice
we
continued
our
way
riding
as
quickly
as
the
obstacles
in
the
forest
would
allow
us
suddenly
our
horses
stopped
short
snorting
and
sniffing
took
his
revolver
in
his
hand
got
off
and
led
his
horse
a
few
yards
from
us
there
was
a
man
lying
on
the
ground
must
be
the
wretch
who
shot
at
me
said
my
companion
and
bending
down
over
the
man
he
spoke
to
him
a
moan
was
the
only
reply
had
not
seen
his
man
so
that
he
could
not
have
recognised
him
he
lighted
a
match
and
we
saw
that
this
one
had
no
gun
i
had
dismounted
and
was
trying
to
raise
the
unfortunate
head
but
i
withdrew
my
hand
covered
with
blood
he
had
opened
his
eyes
and
fixed
them
on
you
versailles
dog
he
said
was
you
who
shot
me
i
missed
you
but
he
tried
to
pull
out
the
revolver
from
his
belt
but
the
effort
was
too
great
and
his
hand
fell
down
inert
on
his
side
had
cocked
his
revolver
but
i
placed
myself
in
front
of
the
man
and
besought
him
to
leave
the
poor
fellow
in
peace
i
could
scarcely
recognise
my
friend
for
this
handsome
man
so
polite
rather
a
snob
but
very
charming
seemed
to
have
turned
into
a
brute
leaning
towards
the
unfortunate
man
his
protruded
he
was
muttering
under
his
teeth
some
inarticulate
words
his
clenched
hand
seemed
to
be
grasping
his
anger
just
as
one
does
an
anonymous
letter
before
flinging
it
away
in
disgust
let
this
man
alone
please
i
said
he
was
as
gallant
a
man
as
he
was
a
good
soldier
he
gave
way
and
seemed
to
become
aware
of
the
situation
again
he
said
helping
me
to
mount
once
more
i
have
taken
you
back
to
your
hotel
i
will
come
back
with
some
men
to
pick
up
this
half
an
hour
later
we
were
back
home
without
having
exchanged
another
word
during
our
ride
i
kept
up
my
friendship
with
but
i
could
never
see
him
again
without
thinking
of
that
scene
suddenly
when
he
was
talking
to
me
the
mask
under
which
i
had
seen
him
for
a
second
would
fix
itself
again
over
his
laughing
face
quite
recently
in
march
general
who
was
commanding
in
algeria
came
to
see
me
one
evening
in
my
at
the
theatre
he
told
me
about
his
difficulties
with
some
of
the
great
arab
chiefs
fancy
he
said
laughing
we
shall
have
a
brush
again
i
saw
the
mask
on
the
face
i
never
saw
him
again
for
he
died
six
months
afterwards
we
were
at
last
able
to
go
back
to
paris
the
abominable
and
shameful
peace
had
been
signed
the
wretched
commune
crushed
everything
was
supposed
to
be
in
order
again
but
what
blood
and
ashes
what
women
in
mourning
what
ruins
in
paris
we
inhaled
the
bitter
odour
of
smoke
all
that
i
touched
at
home
left
on
my
fingers
a
somewhat
greasy
and
almost
imperceptible
colour
a
general
uneasiness
beset
france
and
more
especially
paris
the
theatres
however
opened
their
doors
once
more
and
that
was
a
general
relief
one
morning
i
received
from
the
odéon
a
notice
of
rehearsal
i
shook
out
my
hair
stamped
my
feet
and
sniffed
the
air
like
a
young
horse
snorting
the
was
to
be
opened
for
us
again
we
should
be
able
to
gallop
afresh
through
our
dreams
the
lists
were
ready
the
contest
was
beginning
life
was
commencing
again
it
is
truly
strange
that
mind
should
have
made
of
life
a
perpetual
strife
when
there
is
no
longer
war
there
is
battle
for
there
are
a
hundred
thousand
of
us
aiming
for
the
same
object
god
has
created
the
earth
and
man
for
each
other
the
earth
is
vast
what
ground
there
is
uncultivated
miles
upon
miles
acres
upon
acres
of
new
land
waiting
for
arms
that
will
take
from
its
bosom
the
treasures
of
inexhaustible
nature
and
we
remain
grouped
round
each
other
crowds
of
famishing
people
watching
other
groups
which
are
also
lying
in
wait
the
odéon
opened
its
doors
to
the
public
with
a
repertory
programme
some
new
pieces
were
given
us
to
study
one
of
these
met
with
tremendous
success
it
was
andré
and
was
produced
in
october
this
play
is
a
veritable
masterpiece
and
it
took
its
author
straight
to
the
academy
porel
who
played
the
part
of
met
with
an
enormous
success
he
was
at
that
time
slender
nimble
and
full
of
youthful
ardour
he
needed
a
little
more
poetry
but
the
joyous
laughter
of
his
teeth
made
up
in
ardour
for
what
was
wanting
in
poetic
desire
it
was
very
good
anyhow
my
of
the
young
breton
girl
submissive
to
the
elderly
husband
forced
upon
her
and
living
eternally
with
the
memory
of
the
who
was
absent
and
perhaps
dead
was
pretty
poetical
and
touching
by
reason
of
the
final
sacrifice
there
was
even
a
certain
grandeur
in
the
concluding
part
of
the
piece
it
had
i
must
repeat
an
immense
success
and
increased
my
growing
reputation
i
was
however
awaiting
the
event
which
was
to
consecrate
me
a
star
i
did
not
quite
know
what
i
was
expecting
but
i
knew
that
my
messiah
had
to
come
and
it
was
the
greatest
poet
of
the
last
century
who
was
to
place
on
my
head
the
crown
of
the
elect
xx
victor
hugo
at
the
end
of
that
year
we
were
told
in
rather
a
mysterious
and
solemn
way
that
we
were
going
to
play
a
piece
of
victor
my
mind
at
that
time
of
my
life
was
still
closed
to
great
ideas
i
was
living
in
rather
a
atmosphere
what
with
my
somewhat
cosmopolitan
family
their
rather
snobbish
acquaintances
and
friends
and
the
acquaintances
and
friends
i
had
chosen
in
my
independent
life
as
an
artiste
i
had
heard
victor
hugo
spoken
of
ever
since
my
childhood
as
a
rebel
and
a
renegade
and
his
works
which
i
had
read
with
passion
did
not
prevent
my
judging
him
with
very
great
severity
and
i
blush
with
anger
and
shame
when
i
think
of
all
my
absurd
prejudices
fomented
by
the
imbecile
or
insincere
little
court
which
flattered
me
i
had
a
great
desire
nevertheless
to
play
in
the
of
the
queen
seemed
so
charming
to
me
i
mentioned
my
wish
to
duquesnel
who
said
he
had
already
thought
of
it
jane
essler
an
artiste
then
in
vogue
but
a
trifle
vulgar
had
great
chances
though
against
me
she
was
on
very
amicable
terms
with
paul
meurice
victor
intimate
friend
and
adviser
one
of
my
friends
brought
auguste
vacquerie
to
my
house
he
was
another
friend
and
even
a
relative
of
the
auguste
vacquerie
promised
to
speak
to
victor
hugo
and
two
days
later
he
came
again
assuring
me
that
i
had
every
chance
in
my
favour
paul
meurice
himself
a
very
straightforward
man
a
delightful
soul
had
proposed
me
to
the
author
and
geffroy
the
admirable
artiste
who
had
retired
from
the
comédie
française
and
was
now
asked
to
play
had
said
it
appears
that
he
could
only
see
one
little
queen
of
spain
worthy
to
wear
the
crown
and
i
was
that
one
i
did
not
know
geffroy
i
did
not
know
paid
meurice
and
was
rather
astonished
that
they
should
know
me
the
play
was
to
be
read
to
the
artistes
at
victor
december
at
two
i
was
very
much
spoilt
and
very
much
praised
and
flattered
so
that
i
felt
hurt
at
the
unceremoniousness
of
a
man
who
did
not
condescend
to
disturb
himself
but
asked
women
to
go
to
his
house
when
there
was
neutral
ground
the
theatre
for
the
reading
of
plays
i
mentioned
this
incident
at
five
to
my
little
court
and
men
and
women
alike
exclaimed
that
man
who
was
only
the
other
day
an
outlaw
that
man
who
has
only
just
been
pardoned
that
nobody
dares
to
ask
the
little
idol
the
queen
of
the
fairy
of
fairies
to
put
herself
to
inconvenience
all
my
little
sanctuary
was
in
a
tumult
men
and
women
alike
could
not
keep
still
must
not
go
they
said
him
him
and
they
were
composing
impertinent
disdainful
letters
when
marshal
canrobert
was
announced
he
belonged
at
that
time
to
my
little
five
court
and
he
was
soon
posted
on
what
had
taken
place
by
my
turbulent
visitors
he
was
furiously
angry
at
the
imbecilities
uttered
against
the
great
poet
must
not
go
to
victor
he
said
to
me
it
seems
to
me
that
he
has
no
reason
to
deviate
from
the
regular
custom
but
say
that
you
are
suddenly
unwell
follow
my
advice
and
show
the
respect
for
him
that
we
owe
to
i
followed
my
great
counsel
and
sent
the
following
letter
to
the
poet
the
queen
has
taken
a
chill
and
her
camerara
mayor
forbids
her
to
go
out
you
know
better
than
any
one
else
the
etiquette
of
the
spanish
court
pity
your
queen
i
sent
the
letter
and
the
following
was
the
reply
am
your
valet
madame
the
next
day
the
play
was
read
on
the
stage
to
the
artistes
i
believe
that
the
reading
did
not
take
place
or
at
least
not
entirely
at
the
house
i
then
made
the
acquaintance
of
the
monster
ah
what
a
grudge
i
had
for
a
long
time
against
all
those
silly
people
who
had
prejudiced
me
the
monster
was
charming
so
witty
and
refined
and
so
gallant
with
a
gallantry
that
was
a
homage
and
not
an
insult
he
was
so
good
too
to
the
humble
and
always
so
gay
he
was
not
certainly
the
ideal
of
elegance
but
there
was
a
moderation
in
his
gestures
a
gentleness
in
his
way
of
speaking
which
savoured
of
the
old
french
peer
he
was
quick
at
repartee
and
his
observations
were
gentle
but
pertinent
he
recited
poetry
badly
but
adored
hearing
it
well
recited
he
often
made
sketches
during
the
rehearsals
he
frequently
spoke
in
verse
when
he
wished
to
reprimand
an
artiste
one
day
during
a
rehearsal
he
was
trying
to
convince
poor
talien
about
his
bad
elocution
i
was
bored
by
the
length
of
the
colloquy
and
sat
down
on
the
table
swinging
my
legs
he
understood
my
impatience
and
getting
up
from
the
middle
of
the
orchestra
stalls
he
exclaimed
reine
honnête
et
respectable
ne
devrait
point
ainsi
sur
une
table
i
sprang
up
from
the
table
slightly
embarrassed
and
wanted
to
answer
him
in
rather
a
piquant
or
witty
way
but
i
could
not
find
anything
to
say
and
remained
there
confused
and
in
a
bad
temper
one
day
when
the
rehearsal
was
over
an
hour
earlier
than
usual
i
was
waiting
my
forehead
pressed
against
the
for
the
arrival
of
madame
guérard
who
was
coming
to
fetch
me
i
was
gazing
idly
at
the
footpath
opposite
which
is
bounded
by
the
luxembourg
railings
victor
hugo
had
just
crossed
the
road
and
was
about
to
walk
on
an
old
woman
attracted
his
attention
she
had
just
put
a
heavy
bundle
of
linen
down
on
the
ground
and
was
wiping
her
forehead
on
which
were
great
beads
of
perspiration
in
spite
of
the
cold
her
toothless
mouth
was
half
open
as
she
was
panting
and
her
eyes
had
an
expression
of
distressing
anxiety
as
she
looked
at
the
wide
road
she
had
to
cross
with
carriages
and
omnibuses
passing
each
other
victor
hugo
approached
her
and
after
a
short
conversation
he
drew
a
piece
of
money
from
his
pocket
handed
it
to
the
old
woman
then
taking
off
his
hat
he
confided
it
to
her
and
with
a
quick
movement
and
a
laughing
face
lifted
the
bundle
onto
his
shoulder
and
crossed
the
road
followed
by
the
bewildered
woman
i
rushed
downstairs
to
embrace
him
for
it
but
by
the
time
i
had
reached
the
passage
i
jostled
against
de
chilly
who
wanted
to
stop
me
and
when
i
descended
the
staircase
victor
hugo
had
disappeared
i
could
only
see
the
old
back
but
it
seemed
to
me
that
she
hobbled
along
now
more
briskly
the
next
day
i
told
the
poet
that
i
had
witnessed
his
delicate
good
deed
said
paul
meurice
his
eyes
wet
with
emotion
day
that
dawns
is
a
day
of
kindness
for
i
embraced
victor
hugo
and
we
went
to
the
rehearsal
oh
those
rehearsals
of
bias
i
shall
never
forget
them
for
there
was
such
good
grace
and
charm
about
everything
when
victor
hugo
arrived
everything
brightened
up
his
two
satellites
auguste
vacquerie
and
paul
meurice
scarcely
ever
left
him
and
when
the
master
was
absent
they
kept
up
the
divine
fire
geffroy
severe
sad
and
distinguished
often
gave
me
advice
during
the
intervals
for
rest
i
posed
for
him
in
various
attitudes
for
he
was
a
painter
in
the
of
the
comédie
française
there
are
two
pictures
by
him
representing
two
generations
of
sociétaires
of
both
sexes
the
pictures
are
not
of
very
original
composition
neither
are
they
of
beautiful
colouring
but
they
are
faithful
likenesses
it
appears
and
rather
happily
grouped
lafontaine
who
was
playing
ruy
bias
often
had
long
discussions
with
the
master
in
which
victor
hugo
never
yielded
and
i
must
confess
that
he
was
always
right
lafontaine
had
conviction
and
but
his
elocution
was
very
bad
for
poetry
he
had
lost
his
teeth
and
they
were
replaced
by
a
set
of
false
ones
this
gave
a
certain
slowness
to
his
delivery
and
there
was
a
little
odd
clacking
sound
between
his
real
palate
and
his
artificial
rubber
palate
which
often
distracted
the
ear
listening
attentively
to
catch
the
beauty
of
the
poetry
as
for
poor
talien
who
was
playing
don
guritan
he
made
a
hash
of
it
every
minute
his
comprehension
of
the
was
quite
erroneous
victor
hugo
explained
it
to
him
clearly
and
intelligently
talien
was
a
comedian
a
hard
worker
always
conscientious
but
as
stupid
as
a
goose
what
he
did
not
understand
at
first
he
never
understood
as
long
as
he
lived
he
would
never
understand
but
as
he
was
straightforward
and
loyal
he
put
himself
into
the
hands
of
the
author
and
gave
himself
up
then
in
complete
abnegation
is
not
as
i
understood
it
he
would
say
i
will
do
as
you
tell
he
would
then
rehearse
word
by
word
and
gesture
by
gesture
with
the
inflexions
and
movements
required
this
got
on
my
nerves
in
the
most
painful
way
and
was
a
cruel
blow
dealt
at
the
solidarity
of
my
artistic
pride
i
often
took
this
poor
talien
aside
and
tried
to
urge
him
on
to
rebellion
but
it
was
all
in
vain
he
was
tall
and
his
arms
were
too
long
and
his
eyes
tired
his
nose
was
weary
with
having
grown
too
long
and
it
sank
over
his
lips
in
heartrending
dejection
his
forehead
was
covered
with
thick
hair
and
his
chin
seemed
to
be
running
away
in
a
hurry
from
his
face
a
great
kindliness
was
diffused
all
over
his
being
and
this
kindliness
was
his
very
self
every
one
was
therefore
infinitely
fond
of
him
xxi
a
memorable
supper
january
was
an
artistic
for
the
odéon
the
of
first
nights
and
the
vibrating
younger
elements
were
to
meet
in
the
large
solemn
dusty
theatre
ah
what
a
splendid
stirring
performance
it
was
what
a
triumph
for
geffroy
pale
sinister
and
in
his
black
costume
as
don
salluste
mélingue
rather
disappointed
the
public
as
don
césar
de
bazan
and
the
public
was
in
the
wrong
the
of
don
césar
de
bazan
is
a
treacherously
good
which
always
tempts
artists
by
the
brilliancy
of
the
first
act
but
the
fourth
act
which
belongs
entirely
to
him
is
distressingly
heavy
and
useless
it
might
be
taken
out
of
the
piece
just
like
a
periwinkle
out
of
its
shell
and
the
piece
would
be
none
the
less
clear
and
complete
this
of
january
rent
asunder
though
for
me
the
thin
veil
which
still
made
my
future
hazy
and
i
felt
that
i
was
destined
for
celebrity
until
that
day
i
had
remained
the
little
fairy
i
became
then
the
elect
of
the
public
breathless
dazed
and
yet
delighted
by
my
success
i
did
not
know
to
whom
to
reply
in
the
stream
of
male
and
female
admirers
then
suddenly
i
saw
the
crowd
separating
and
forming
two
lines
and
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
victor
hugo
and
girardin
coming
towards
me
in
a
second
all
the
stupid
ideas
i
had
had
about
this
immense
genius
flashed
across
me
i
remembered
my
first
interview
when
i
had
been
stiff
and
barely
polite
to
this
kind
indulgent
man
at
that
moment
when
all
my
life
was
opening
its
wings
i
should
have
liked
to
cry
out
to
him
my
repentance
and
to
tell
him
of
my
devout
gratitude
before
i
could
speak
though
he
was
down
on
his
knee
and
raising
my
two
hands
to
his
lips
he
murmured
you
thank
you
and
so
it
was
he
who
said
he
the
great
victor
hugo
whose
soul
was
so
beautiful
whose
universal
genius
filled
the
world
he
whose
generous
hands
flung
pardons
like
gems
to
all
his
insulters
ah
how
small
i
felt
how
ashamed
and
yet
how
happy
he
then
rose
shook
the
hands
that
were
held
out
to
him
finding
for
every
one
the
right
word
he
was
so
handsome
that
night
with
his
broad
forehead
which
seemed
to
retain
the
light
his
thick
silvery
fleece
of
hair
and
his
laughing
luminous
eyes
not
daring
to
fling
myself
in
victor
arms
i
fell
into
the
sure
friend
of
my
first
steps
and
i
burst
into
tears
he
took
me
aside
in
my
must
not
let
yourself
be
intoxicated
with
this
great
success
now
he
said
must
be
no
more
risky
jumps
now
that
you
are
crowned
with
laurels
you
will
have
to
be
more
yielding
more
docile
more
feel
that
i
shall
never
be
yielding
nor
docile
my
friend
i
answered
looking
at
him
will
try
to
be
more
sociable
but
that
is
all
i
can
promise
as
to
my
crown
i
assure
you
that
in
spite
of
my
risky
jumps
and
i
feel
that
i
shall
always
be
making
some
the
crown
will
not
shake
paul
meurice
who
had
come
up
to
us
overheard
this
conversation
and
reminded
me
of
it
on
the
evening
of
the
first
performance
of
at
the
sarah
bernhardt
theatre
on
february
on
returning
home
i
sat
up
a
long
time
talking
to
madame
guérard
and
when
she
wanted
to
go
i
begged
her
to
stay
longer
i
had
become
so
rich
in
hopes
for
the
future
that
i
was
afraid
of
thieves
petit
stayed
on
with
me
and
we
talked
till
daybreak
at
seven
we
took
a
cab
and
i
drove
my
dear
friend
home
and
then
continued
driving
for
another
hour
i
had
already
achieved
a
fair
number
of
successes
passant
le
drame
de
la
rue
de
la
anna
danby
in
and
but
i
felt
that
the
success
was
greater
than
any
of
the
others
and
that
this
time
i
had
become
some
one
to
be
criticised
but
not
to
be
overlooked
i
often
went
in
the
morning
to
victor
and
he
was
always
very
charming
and
kind
when
i
was
quite
at
my
ease
with
him
i
spoke
to
him
about
my
first
impressions
about
all
my
stupid
nervous
rebellion
with
regard
to
him
about
all
that
i
had
been
told
and
all
that
i
had
believed
in
my
naïve
ignorance
about
political
matters
one
morning
the
master
took
great
delight
in
my
conversation
he
sent
for
madame
drouet
the
sweet
soul
the
companion
of
his
glorious
and
rebellious
mind
he
told
her
in
a
laughing
but
melancholy
way
that
the
evil
work
of
bad
people
is
to
sow
error
in
every
soil
whether
favourable
or
not
that
morning
is
engraved
for
ever
in
my
mind
for
the
great
man
talked
a
long
time
oh
it
was
not
for
me
but
for
what
i
represented
in
his
eyes
was
i
not
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
young
generation
in
which
a
and
clerical
education
had
warped
the
intelligence
by
closing
the
mind
to
every
generous
idea
to
every
flight
towards
the
new
when
i
left
victor
hugo
that
morning
i
felt
myself
more
worthy
of
his
friendship
i
then
went
to
as
i
wanted
to
talk
to
some
one
who
loved
the
poet
but
he
was
out
i
went
next
to
marshal
and
there
i
had
a
great
surprise
just
as
i
was
getting
out
of
the
carriage
i
nearly
fell
into
the
arms
of
the
marshal
who
was
coming
out
of
his
house
is
it
the
matter
is
it
postponed
he
asked
laughing
i
did
not
understand
and
gazed
at
him
rather
bewildered
have
you
forgotten
that
you
invited
me
to
luncheon
he
asked
i
was
quite
confused
for
i
had
entirely
forgotten
it
all
the
better
i
said
very
much
wanted
to
talk
to
you
come
i
am
going
to
take
you
with
me
i
then
related
my
visit
to
victor
hugo
and
repeated
all
the
fine
thoughts
he
had
uttered
forgetting
that
i
was
constantly
saying
things
that
were
contrary
to
the
ideas
this
admirable
man
could
admire
though
and
if
he
could
not
change
his
opinions
he
approved
the
great
ideas
which
were
to
bring
about
great
changes
one
day
when
he
and
busnach
were
both
at
my
house
there
was
a
political
discussion
which
became
rather
violent
i
was
afraid
for
a
moment
that
things
might
take
a
bad
turn
as
busnach
was
the
most
witty
and
at
the
same
time
the
rudest
man
in
france
it
is
only
fair
to
say
though
that
if
marshal
canrobert
was
a
polite
man
and
very
well
bred
he
was
not
at
all
behind
william
busnach
in
wit
the
latter
was
worked
up
by
the
chafing
speeches
of
the
marshal
challenge
you
monsieur
he
exclaimed
write
about
the
odious
utopias
that
you
have
just
been
supporting
monsieur
busnach
replied
canrobert
coldly
do
not
use
the
same
steel
for
writing
history
you
use
a
pen
and
i
a
the
luncheon
that
i
had
so
completely
forgotten
was
nevertheless
a
luncheon
arranged
several
days
previously
on
reaching
home
we
found
there
paul
de
rémusat
charming
mlle
hocquigny
and
de
monbel
a
young
i
explained
my
lateness
as
well
as
i
could
and
that
morning
finished
in
the
most
delicious
harmony
of
ideas
i
have
never
felt
more
than
i
did
that
day
the
infinite
joy
of
listening
during
a
silence
mlle
hocquigny
turned
to
the
marshal
and
said
you
not
of
the
opinion
that
our
young
friend
should
enter
the
comédie
française
no
no
i
exclaimed
am
so
happy
at
the
odéon
i
began
at
the
comédie
and
the
short
time
i
remained
there
i
was
very
will
be
obliged
to
go
back
there
my
dear
friend
obliged
believe
me
it
will
be
better
early
than
do
not
spoil
pleasure
for
me
for
i
have
never
been
happier
one
morning
shortly
after
this
my
maid
brought
me
a
letter
the
large
round
stamp
on
which
are
the
words
was
on
the
corner
of
the
envelope
i
remembered
that
ten
years
previously
almost
day
for
day
our
old
servant
marguerite
had
with
my
permission
handed
me
a
letter
in
the
same
kind
of
envelope
my
face
then
had
flushed
with
joy
but
this
time
i
felt
a
faint
tinge
of
pallor
touch
my
cheeks
when
events
occur
which
disturb
my
life
i
always
have
a
movement
of
recoil
i
cling
for
a
second
to
what
is
and
then
i
fling
myself
headlong
into
what
is
to
be
it
is
like
a
gymnast
who
clings
first
to
his
trapeze
bar
in
order
to
fling
himself
afterwards
with
full
force
into
space
in
one
second
what
now
is
becomes
for
me
what
was
and
i
love
it
with
tender
emotion
as
something
dead
but
i
adore
what
is
to
be
without
seeking
even
to
know
about
it
for
what
is
to
be
is
the
unknown
the
mysterious
attraction
i
always
fancy
that
it
will
be
something
unheard
of
and
i
shudder
from
head
to
foot
in
delicious
uneasiness
i
receive
quantities
of
letters
and
it
seems
to
me
that
i
never
receive
enough
i
watch
them
accumulating
just
as
i
watch
the
waves
of
the
sea
what
are
they
going
to
bring
me
these
mysterious
envelopes
large
small
pink
blue
yellow
white
what
are
they
going
to
fling
upon
the
rock
these
great
wild
waves
dark
with
seaweed
what
corpse
what
remains
of
a
wreck
what
are
these
little
brisk
waves
going
to
leave
on
the
beach
these
reflections
of
a
blue
sky
little
laughing
waves
what
pink
what
mauve
anemone
what
pearly
shell
so
i
never
open
my
letters
immediately
i
look
at
the
envelopes
try
to
recognise
the
handwriting
and
the
seal
and
it
is
only
when
i
am
quite
certain
from
whom
the
letter
comes
that
i
open
it
the
others
i
leave
my
secretary
to
open
or
a
kind
friend
suzanne
seylor
my
friends
know
this
so
well
that
they
always
put
their
initials
in
the
corner
of
their
envelopes
at
that
time
i
had
no
secretary
but
petit
served
me
as
such
i
looked
at
the
envelope
a
long
time
and
gave
it
at
last
to
madame
guérard
is
a
letter
from
perrin
director
of
the
comédie
française
she
said
asks
if
you
can
fix
a
time
to
see
him
on
tuesday
or
wednesday
afternoon
at
the
comédie
française
or
at
your
own
what
day
is
it
i
asked
she
replied
i
then
installed
madame
guérard
at
my
desk
and
asked
her
to
reply
that
i
would
go
there
the
following
day
at
three
i
was
earning
very
little
at
that
time
at
the
odéon
i
was
living
on
what
my
father
had
left
me
that
is
on
the
transaction
made
by
the
havre
notary
and
not
much
remained
i
therefore
went
to
see
duquesnel
and
showed
him
the
letter
what
are
you
going
to
do
he
asked
i
have
come
to
ask
your
well
i
advise
you
to
remain
at
the
odéon
besides
your
engagement
does
not
terminate
for
another
year
and
i
shall
not
allow
you
leave
raise
my
salary
then
i
said
am
offered
twelve
thousand
francs
a
year
at
the
comédie
give
me
fifteen
thousand
here
and
i
will
stay
for
i
do
not
want
to
to
me
said
the
charming
manager
in
a
friendly
way
know
that
i
am
not
free
to
act
alone
i
will
do
my
best
i
promise
and
duquesnel
certainly
kept
his
word
here
before
going
to
the
comédie
and
i
will
give
you
reply
but
take
my
advice
and
if
he
obstinately
refuses
to
increase
your
salary
do
not
leave
we
shall
find
some
way
and
besides
anyhow
i
can
not
say
any
i
returned
the
following
day
according
to
arrangement
i
found
duquesnel
and
chilly
in
the
managerial
office
chilly
began
at
once
somewhat
roughly
so
you
want
to
leave
duquesnel
tells
me
where
are
you
going
it
is
most
stupid
for
your
place
is
here
just
consider
and
think
it
over
for
yourself
at
the
gymnase
they
only
give
modern
pieces
dressy
plays
that
is
not
your
style
at
the
vaudeville
it
is
the
same
at
the
gaîté
you
would
spoil
your
voice
you
are
too
distinguished
for
the
i
looked
at
him
without
replying
i
saw
that
his
partner
had
not
spoken
to
him
about
the
comédie
française
he
felt
awkward
and
mumbled
then
you
are
of
my
opinion
i
answered
have
forgotten
the
he
was
sitting
in
his
big
and
he
burst
out
laughing
no
my
dear
girl
he
said
must
not
tell
me
that
had
enough
of
your
queer
character
at
the
comédie
i
dined
the
other
night
with
maubant
and
when
some
one
said
that
you
ought
to
be
engaged
at
the
comédie
française
he
nearly
choked
with
rage
i
can
assure
you
the
great
tragedian
did
not
show
much
affection
for
well
you
ought
to
have
taken
my
part
i
exclaimed
irritated
know
very
well
that
i
am
a
most
serious
member
of
your
i
did
take
your
part
he
said
i
added
even
that
it
would
be
a
very
fortunate
thing
for
the
comédie
if
it
could
have
an
artiste
with
your
will
power
which
perhaps
might
relieve
the
monotonous
tone
of
the
house
and
i
only
spoke
as
i
thought
but
the
poor
tragedian
was
beside
himself
he
does
not
consider
that
you
have
any
talent
in
the
first
place
he
maintains
that
you
do
not
know
how
to
recite
verse
he
declares
that
you
make
all
your
too
broad
finally
when
he
had
no
arguments
left
he
declared
that
as
long
as
he
lives
you
will
never
enter
the
comédie
i
was
silent
for
a
moment
weighing
the
pros
and
cons
of
the
probable
result
of
my
experiment
finally
coming
to
a
decision
i
murmured
somewhat
waveringly
then
you
will
not
give
me
a
higher
salary
a
thousand
times
no
yelled
chilly
will
try
to
make
me
pay
up
when
your
engagement
comes
to
an
end
and
then
we
shall
see
but
i
have
your
signature
until
then
you
have
mine
too
and
i
hold
to
our
engagement
the
théâtre
français
is
the
only
one
that
would
suit
you
beside
ours
and
i
am
quite
easy
in
my
mind
with
regard
to
that
make
a
mistake
perhaps
i
answered
he
got
up
brusquely
and
came
and
stood
opposite
me
his
two
hands
in
his
pockets
he
then
said
in
an
odious
and
familiar
tone
it
is
it
you
think
i
am
an
idiot
then
i
got
up
too
and
said
coldly
pushing
him
gently
back
think
you
are
a
triple
i
then
hurried
away
towards
the
staircase
and
all
shouting
was
in
vain
i
ran
down
the
stairs
two
at
a
time
on
arriving
under
the
odéon
arcade
i
was
stopped
by
paul
meurice
who
was
just
going
to
invite
duquesnel
and
chilly
on
behalf
of
victor
hugo
to
a
supper
to
celebrate
the
one
hundredth
performance
of
have
just
come
from
your
house
he
said
have
left
you
a
few
lines
from
victor
good
all
right
i
replied
getting
into
my
carriage
shall
see
you
then
my
heavens
what
a
hurry
you
are
in
he
said
i
replied
and
then
leaning
out
of
the
window
i
said
to
my
coachman
to
the
comédie
i
looked
at
paul
meurice
to
wish
him
farewell
he
was
standing
stupefied
on
the
arcade
steps
on
arriving
at
the
comédie
i
sent
my
card
to
perrin
and
five
minutes
later
was
ushered
in
to
that
icy
mannikin
there
were
two
very
distinct
personages
in
this
man
the
one
was
the
man
he
was
himself
and
the
other
the
one
he
had
created
for
the
requirements
of
his
profession
perrin
himself
was
gallant
pleasant
witty
and
slightly
timid
the
mannikin
was
cold
and
somewhat
given
to
posing
i
was
first
received
by
perrin
the
mannikin
he
was
standing
up
his
head
bent
bowing
to
a
woman
his
arm
outstretched
to
indicate
the
hospitable
armchair
he
waited
with
a
certain
affectation
until
i
was
seated
before
sitting
down
himself
he
then
picked
up
a
in
order
to
have
something
to
do
with
his
hands
and
in
a
rather
weak
voice
the
voice
of
the
mannikin
he
remarked
you
thought
it
over
mademoiselle
monsieur
and
here
i
am
to
give
my
before
he
had
time
to
give
me
any
encouragement
to
dabble
with
the
things
on
his
desk
i
drew
up
my
chair
picked
up
a
pen
and
prepared
to
sign
the
paper
i
did
not
take
enough
ink
at
first
and
i
stretched
my
arm
out
across
the
whole
width
of
the
writing
table
and
dipped
my
pen
this
time
resolutely
to
the
bottom
of
the
i
took
too
much
ink
however
this
time
and
on
the
return
journey
a
huge
spot
of
it
fell
on
the
large
sheet
of
white
paper
in
front
of
the
mannikin
he
bent
his
head
for
he
was
slightly
and
looked
for
a
moment
like
a
bird
when
it
discovers
a
in
its
grain
he
then
proceeded
to
put
aside
the
blotted
sheet
a
minute
oh
wait
a
minute
i
exclaimed
seizing
the
inky
paper
want
to
see
whether
i
am
doing
right
or
not
to
sign
if
that
is
a
butterfly
i
am
right
and
if
anything
else
no
matter
what
i
am
i
took
the
sheet
doubled
it
in
the
middle
of
the
enormous
blot
and
pressed
it
firmly
together
emile
perrin
thereupon
began
to
laugh
giving
up
his
mannikin
attitude
entirely
he
leaned
over
to
examine
the
paper
with
me
and
we
opened
it
very
gently
just
as
one
opens
hand
after
imprisoning
a
fly
when
the
paper
was
spread
open
in
the
midst
of
its
whiteness
a
magnificent
black
butterfly
with
outspread
wings
was
to
be
seen
then
said
perrin
with
nothing
of
the
mannikin
left
were
quite
right
in
after
this
we
talked
for
some
time
like
two
friends
who
meet
again
for
this
man
was
charming
and
very
fascinating
in
spite
of
his
ugliness
when
i
left
him
we
were
friends
and
delighted
with
each
other
i
was
playing
in
that
night
at
the
odéon
towards
ten
duquesnel
came
to
my
were
rather
rough
on
that
poor
chilly
he
said
you
really
were
not
nice
you
ought
to
have
come
back
when
i
called
you
is
it
true
as
paul
meurice
tells
us
that
you
went
straight
to
the
théâtre
français
read
for
yourself
i
said
handing
him
my
engagement
with
the
comédie
duquesnel
took
the
paper
and
read
it
you
let
me
show
it
to
chilly
he
asked
it
him
certainly
i
replied
he
came
nearer
and
said
in
a
grave
hurt
tone
ought
never
to
have
done
that
without
telling
me
first
it
shows
a
lack
of
confidence
i
do
not
he
was
right
but
the
thing
was
done
a
moment
later
chilly
arrived
furious
gesticulating
shouting
stammering
in
his
anger
is
abominable
he
said
is
treason
and
you
had
not
even
the
right
to
do
it
i
shall
make
you
pay
as
i
felt
in
a
bad
humour
i
turned
my
back
on
him
and
apologised
as
feebly
as
possible
to
duquesnel
he
was
hurt
and
i
was
a
little
ashamed
for
this
man
had
given
me
nothing
but
proofs
of
kindliness
and
it
was
he
who
in
spite
of
chilly
and
many
other
unwilling
people
had
held
the
door
open
for
my
future
chilly
kept
his
word
and
brought
an
action
against
me
and
the
comédie
i
lost
and
had
to
pay
six
thousand
francs
damages
to
the
managers
of
the
odéon
a
few
weeks
later
victor
hugo
invited
the
artistes
who
performed
in
to
a
big
supper
in
honour
of
the
one
hundredth
performance
this
was
a
great
delight
to
me
as
i
had
never
been
present
at
a
supper
of
this
kind
i
had
scarcely
spoken
to
chilly
since
our
last
scene
on
the
night
in
question
he
was
placed
at
my
right
and
we
had
to
get
reconciled
i
was
seated
to
the
right
of
victor
hugo
and
to
his
left
was
madame
lambquin
who
was
playing
the
camerara
mayor
and
duquesnel
was
next
to
madame
lambquin
opposite
the
illustrious
poet
was
another
poet
théophile
gautier
with
his
head
on
an
body
he
had
a
brilliant
mind
and
said
the
choicest
things
with
a
horse
laugh
the
flesh
of
his
fat
flabby
wan
face
was
pierced
by
two
eyes
veiled
by
heavy
lids
the
expression
of
them
was
charming
but
far
away
there
was
in
this
man
an
oriental
nobility
choked
by
western
fashion
and
customs
i
knew
nearly
all
his
poetry
and
i
gazed
at
him
with
affection
the
fond
lover
of
the
beautiful
it
amused
me
to
imagine
him
dressed
in
superb
oriental
costumes
i
could
see
him
lying
down
on
huge
cushions
his
beautiful
hands
playing
with
gems
of
all
colours
and
some
of
his
verses
came
in
murmurs
to
my
lips
i
was
just
setting
off
with
him
in
a
dream
that
was
infinite
when
a
word
from
my
neighbour
victor
hugo
made
me
turn
towards
him
what
a
difference
he
was
just
himself
the
great
poet
the
most
ordinary
of
beings
except
for
his
luminous
forehead
he
was
although
very
active
his
nose
was
common
his
eyes
lewd
and
his
mouth
without
any
beauty
his
voice
alone
had
nobility
and
charm
i
liked
to
listen
to
him
whilst
looking
at
théophile
gautier
i
was
a
little
embarrassed
though
when
i
looked
across
the
table
for
at
the
side
of
the
poet
was
an
odious
individual
paul
de
victor
his
cheeks
looked
like
two
bladders
from
which
the
oil
they
contained
was
oozing
out
his
nose
was
sharp
and
like
a
beak
his
eyes
and
hard
his
arms
were
too
short
and
he
was
too
stout
he
looked
like
a
jaundice
he
had
plenty
of
wit
and
talent
but
he
employed
both
in
saying
and
writing
more
harm
than
good
i
knew
that
this
man
hated
me
and
i
promptly
returned
him
hatred
for
hatred
in
answer
to
the
toast
proposed
by
victor
hugo
thanking
every
one
for
such
zealous
help
on
the
revival
of
his
work
each
person
raised
his
glass
and
looked
towards
the
poet
but
the
illustrious
master
turned
towards
me
and
continued
to
you
madame
just
at
this
moment
paul
de
victor
put
his
glass
down
so
violently
on
the
table
that
it
broke
there
was
an
instant
of
stupor
and
then
i
leaned
across
the
table
and
held
my
glass
out
towards
paul
de
victor
mine
monsieur
i
said
then
when
you
drink
you
will
know
what
my
thoughts
are
in
reply
to
yours
which
you
have
just
expressed
so
clearly
the
horrid
man
took
my
glass
but
with
what
a
look
victor
hugo
finished
his
speech
in
the
midst
of
applause
and
cheers
duquesnel
then
leaned
back
and
spoke
to
me
quietly
he
asked
me
to
tell
chilly
to
reply
to
victor
hugo
i
did
as
requested
but
he
gazed
at
me
with
a
glassy
look
and
in
a
faraway
voice
replied
one
is
holding
my
i
looked
at
him
more
attentively
whilst
duquesnel
asked
for
silence
for
de
speech
i
saw
that
his
fingers
were
grasping
a
fork
desperately
the
tips
of
his
fingers
were
white
the
rest
of
the
hand
was
violet
i
took
his
hand
and
it
was
icy
cold
the
other
was
hanging
down
inert
under
the
table
there
was
silence
and
all
eyes
turned
towards
chilly
up
i
said
seized
with
terror
he
made
a
movement
and
his
head
suddenly
fell
forward
with
his
face
on
his
plate
there
was
a
muffled
uproar
and
the
few
women
present
surrounded
the
poor
man
stupid
commonplace
indifferent
things
were
uttered
in
the
same
way
that
one
mutters
familiar
prayers
his
son
was
sent
for
and
then
two
of
the
waiters
came
and
carried
the
body
away
living
but
inert
and
placed
it
in
a
small
duquesnel
stayed
with
him
begging
me
however
to
go
back
to
the
guests
i
returned
to
the
room
where
the
supper
had
taken
place
groups
had
been
formed
and
when
i
was
seen
entering
i
was
asked
if
he
was
still
as
doctor
has
just
arrived
and
he
can
not
yet
say
i
replied
is
indigestion
said
lafontaine
ruy
blas
tossing
off
a
glass
of
liqueur
brandy
is
cerebral
anaemia
pronounced
talien
don
guritan
clumsily
for
he
was
always
losing
his
memory
victor
hugo
approached
and
said
very
simply
is
a
beautiful
kind
of
he
then
took
my
arm
and
led
me
away
to
the
other
end
of
the
room
trying
to
chase
my
thoughts
away
by
gallant
and
poetical
whispers
some
little
time
passed
with
this
gloom
weighing
on
us
and
then
duquesnel
appeared
he
was
pale
but
appeared
as
if
nothing
serious
was
the
matter
he
was
ready
to
answer
all
questions
oh
yes
he
had
just
been
taken
home
it
would
be
nothing
it
appeared
he
only
needed
rest
for
a
couple
of
days
probably
his
feet
had
been
cold
during
the
meal
put
in
one
of
the
guests
certainly
was
a
fine
draught
under
the
duquesnel
was
just
replying
to
some
one
who
was
worrying
him
no
doubt
there
was
too
much
heat
for
his
added
another
of
the
guests
heads
were
nearly
on
fire
with
that
wretched
i
could
see
the
moment
arriving
when
victor
hugo
would
be
reproached
by
all
of
his
guests
for
the
cold
the
heat
the
food
and
the
wine
of
his
banquet
all
these
imbecile
remarks
got
on
nerves
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
drawing
me
away
from
the
crowd
said
all
over
with
i
had
had
the
presentiment
of
this
but
the
certitude
of
it
now
caused
me
intense
grief
want
to
go
i
said
to
duquesnel
tell
some
one
to
ask
for
my
i
moved
towards
the
small
which
served
as
a
for
our
wraps
and
there
old
madame
lambquin
knocked
up
against
me
slightly
intoxicated
by
the
heat
and
the
wine
she
was
waltzing
with
talien
i
beg
your
pardon
little
madonna
she
said
nearly
knocked
you
i
pulled
her
towards
me
and
without
reflecting
whispered
to
her
dance
any
more
mamma
lambquin
chilly
is
she
was
purple
but
her
face
turned
as
white
as
chalk
her
teeth
began
to
chatter
but
she
did
not
utter
a
word
my
dear
lambquin
i
murmured
did
not
know
i
should
make
you
so
she
was
not
listening
to
me
though
any
longer
she
was
putting
on
her
cloak
you
leaving
she
asked
me
i
replied
you
drive
me
home
i
will
then
tell
you
she
wrapped
a
black
fichu
round
her
head
and
we
both
went
downstairs
accompanied
by
duquesnel
and
paul
meurice
who
saw
us
into
the
carriage
she
lived
in
the
germain
quarter
and
i
in
the
rue
de
rome
on
the
way
the
poor
woman
told
me
the
following
story
know
my
dear
she
began
have
a
mania
for
somnambulists
and
of
all
kinds
well
last
friday
you
see
i
only
consult
them
on
a
friday
a
woman
who
tells
fortunes
by
cards
said
to
me
will
die
a
week
after
a
man
who
is
dark
and
not
young
and
whose
life
is
connected
with
well
my
dear
i
thought
she
was
just
making
game
of
me
for
there
is
no
man
whose
life
is
connected
with
mine
as
i
am
a
widow
and
have
never
had
any
i
therefore
abused
her
for
this
as
i
pay
her
seven
francs
she
charges
ten
francs
to
other
people
but
seven
francs
to
artistes
she
was
furious
at
my
not
believing
her
and
she
seized
my
hands
and
said
no
good
yelling
at
me
for
it
is
as
i
say
and
if
you
want
me
to
tell
you
the
exact
truth
it
is
a
man
who
supports
you
and
even
to
be
more
exact
still
there
are
two
men
who
support
you
the
one
dark
and
the
other
fair
a
nice
thing
that
she
had
not
finished
her
speech
before
i
had
given
her
such
a
slap
as
she
had
never
had
in
her
life
i
can
assure
you
afterwards
though
i
puzzled
my
head
to
find
out
what
the
wretched
woman
could
have
meant
and
all
i
could
find
was
that
the
two
men
who
support
me
the
one
dark
and
the
other
fair
are
our
two
managers
chilly
and
duquesnel
and
now
you
tell
me
that
chilly
she
stopped
short
breathless
with
her
story
and
again
seized
with
terror
feel
stifled
she
murmured
and
in
spite
of
the
freezing
cold
we
lowered
both
the
windows
on
arriving
i
helped
her
up
her
four
flights
of
stairs
and
after
telling
the
to
look
after
her
and
giving
the
woman
a
piece
to
make
sure
that
she
would
do
so
i
went
home
myself
very
much
upset
by
all
these
incidents
as
dramatic
as
they
were
unexpected
in
the
middle
of
a
three
days
later
chilly
died
without
ever
recovering
consciousness
twelve
days
later
poor
lambquin
died
to
the
priest
who
gave
her
absolution
she
said
am
dying
because
i
listened
to
and
believed
the
xxii
at
the
comédie
française
again
sculpture
i
left
the
odéon
with
very
great
regret
for
i
adored
and
still
adore
that
theatre
it
always
seems
as
though
in
itself
it
were
a
little
provincial
town
its
hospitable
arcades
under
which
so
many
poor
old
take
fresh
air
and
shelter
themselves
from
the
sun
the
large
flagstones
all
round
between
the
crevices
of
which
microscopic
yellow
grass
grows
its
tall
pillars
blackened
by
time
by
hands
and
by
the
dirt
from
the
road
the
uninterrupted
noise
going
on
all
around
the
departure
of
the
omnibuses
like
the
departure
of
the
old
coaches
the
fraternity
of
the
people
who
meet
there
everything
even
to
the
very
railings
of
the
luxembourg
gives
it
a
quite
special
aspect
in
the
midst
of
paris
then
too
there
is
a
kind
of
odour
of
the
colleges
there
the
very
walls
are
impregnated
with
youthful
hopes
people
are
not
always
talking
there
of
yesterday
as
they
do
in
the
other
theatres
the
young
artistes
who
come
there
talk
of
in
short
my
mind
never
goes
back
to
those
few
years
of
my
life
without
a
childish
emotion
without
thinking
of
laughter
and
without
a
dilation
of
the
nostrils
inhaling
again
the
odour
of
little
ordinary
bouquets
clumsily
tied
up
bouquets
which
had
all
the
freshness
of
flowers
that
grow
in
the
open
air
flowers
that
were
the
offerings
of
the
hearts
of
twenty
summers
little
bouquets
paid
for
out
of
the
purses
of
students
i
would
not
take
anything
away
with
me
from
the
odéon
i
left
the
furniture
of
my
to
a
young
artiste
i
left
my
costumes
all
the
little
toilette
knickknacks
i
divided
them
and
gave
them
away
i
felt
that
my
life
of
hopes
and
dreams
was
to
cease
there
i
felt
that
the
ground
was
now
ready
for
the
fruition
of
all
the
dreams
but
that
the
struggle
with
life
was
about
to
commence
and
i
divined
rightly
my
first
experience
at
the
comédie
française
had
not
been
a
success
i
knew
that
i
was
going
into
the
den
i
counted
few
friends
in
this
house
except
laroche
coquelin
and
the
first
two
my
friends
of
the
conservatoire
and
the
latter
of
the
odéon
among
the
women
marie
lloyd
and
sophie
croizette
both
friends
of
my
childhood
the
disagreeable
jouassain
who
was
nice
only
to
me
and
the
adorable
marie
brohan
whose
kindness
delighted
the
soul
whose
wit
charmed
the
mind
and
whose
indifference
rebuffed
devotion
perrin
decided
that
i
should
make
my
in
de
according
to
wish
the
rehearsals
began
in
the
which
troubled
me
very
much
mlle
brohan
was
to
play
the
part
of
the
marquise
de
prie
at
this
time
she
was
so
fat
as
to
be
almost
unsightly
while
i
was
so
thin
that
the
composers
of
popular
and
comic
verses
took
my
meagre
proportions
as
their
theme
and
the
cartoonists
as
a
subject
for
their
albums
it
was
therefore
impossible
for
the
duc
de
richelieu
to
mistake
the
marquise
de
prie
madeleine
brohan
for
mademoiselle
de
sarah
bernhardt
in
the
irreverent
nocturnal
rendezvous
given
by
the
marquise
to
the
duc
who
thinks
he
embraces
the
chaste
mademoiselle
de
at
each
rehearsal
bressant
who
took
the
part
of
the
duc
de
richelieu
would
stop
saying
it
is
too
ridiculous
i
must
play
the
duc
de
richelieu
with
both
my
arms
cut
off
and
madeleine
left
the
rehearsal
to
go
to
the
room
in
order
to
try
and
get
rid
of
the
this
was
exactly
what
perrin
wanted
he
had
from
the
earliest
moment
thought
of
croizette
but
he
wanted
to
have
his
hand
forced
for
private
and
underhand
reasons
which
he
knew
and
which
others
guessed
at
last
the
change
took
place
and
the
serious
rehearsals
commenced
then
the
first
performance
was
announced
for
november
i
have
always
suffered
and
still
suffer
terribly
from
stage
fright
especially
when
i
know
that
much
is
expected
of
me
i
knew
a
long
time
beforehand
that
every
seat
in
the
house
had
been
booked
i
knew
that
the
press
expected
a
great
success
and
that
perrin
himself
was
reckoning
on
a
long
series
of
big
receipts
alas
all
these
hopes
and
predictions
went
for
nothing
and
my
at
the
comédie
française
was
only
moderately
successful
the
following
is
an
extract
from
the
of
november
it
was
written
by
francisque
sarcey
with
whom
i
was
not
then
acquainted
but
who
was
following
my
career
with
very
great
interest
was
a
very
brilliant
assembly
as
this
had
attracted
all
the
fact
is
beside
the
special
merit
of
mlle
sarah
bernhardt
a
whole
crowd
of
true
or
false
stories
had
been
circulated
about
her
personally
and
all
this
had
excited
the
curiosity
of
the
parisian
public
her
appearance
was
a
disappointment
she
had
by
her
costume
exaggerated
in
a
most
ostentatious
way
a
slenderness
which
is
elegant
under
the
veils
and
ample
drapery
of
the
grecian
and
roman
heroines
but
which
is
objectionable
in
modern
dress
then
too
either
powder
does
not
suit
her
or
stage
fright
had
made
her
terribly
pale
the
effect
of
this
long
white
face
emerging
from
a
long
black
sheath
was
certainly
unpleasant
i
looked
like
an
ant
particularly
as
the
eyes
had
lost
their
brilliancy
and
all
that
relieved
the
face
were
the
sparkling
white
teeth
she
went
through
the
first
three
acts
with
a
convulsive
tremor
and
we
only
recognised
the
sarah
of
by
two
couplets
which
she
gave
in
her
enchanting
voice
with
the
most
wonderful
grace
but
in
all
the
more
powerful
passages
she
was
a
failure
i
doubt
whether
mlle
sarah
bernhardt
will
ever
with
her
delicious
voice
be
able
to
render
those
deep
thrilling
notes
expressive
of
paroxysms
of
violent
passion
which
are
capable
of
carrying
away
an
audience
if
only
nature
had
endowed
her
with
this
gift
she
would
be
a
perfect
artiste
and
there
are
none
such
on
the
stage
roused
by
the
coldness
of
her
public
mlle
sarah
bernhardt
was
entirely
herself
in
the
fifth
act
this
was
certainly
our
sarah
once
more
the
sarah
of
whom
we
had
admired
so
much
at
the
odéon
as
sarcey
said
i
made
a
complete
failure
of
my
my
excuse
though
was
not
the
to
which
he
attributed
it
but
the
terrible
anxiety
i
felt
on
seeing
my
mother
hurriedly
leave
her
seat
in
the
dress
circle
five
minutes
after
my
appearance
on
the
stage
i
had
glanced
at
her
on
entering
and
had
noticed
her
pallor
when
she
went
out
i
felt
that
she
was
about
to
have
one
of
those
attacks
which
endangered
her
life
so
that
the
first
act
seemed
to
me
interminable
i
uttered
one
word
after
another
stammering
through
my
sentences
with
only
one
idea
in
my
head
a
longing
to
know
what
had
happened
oh
the
public
can
not
conceive
of
the
tortures
endured
by
the
unfortunate
comedians
who
are
there
before
them
in
flesh
and
blood
on
the
stage
gesticulating
and
uttering
phrases
while
their
heart
all
torn
with
anguish
is
with
the
beloved
absent
one
who
is
suffering
as
a
rule
one
can
fling
away
the
worries
and
anxieties
of
life
put
off
own
personality
for
a
few
hours
take
on
another
and
forgetting
everything
else
enter
as
it
were
into
another
life
but
that
is
impossible
when
our
dear
ones
are
suffering
anxiety
then
lays
hold
of
us
attenuating
the
bright
side
magnifying
the
dark
maddening
our
brain
which
is
living
two
lives
at
once
and
tormenting
our
heart
which
is
beating
as
though
it
would
burst
these
were
the
sensations
i
experienced
during
the
first
act
what
has
happened
to
mamma
were
my
first
words
on
leaving
the
stage
no
one
could
tell
me
anything
croizette
came
up
to
me
and
said
the
matter
i
hardly
recognise
you
as
you
are
and
you
yourself
at
all
just
now
in
the
in
a
few
words
i
told
her
what
i
had
seen
and
all
that
i
had
felt
frédéric
febvre
sent
at
once
to
get
news
and
the
doctor
came
hurrying
to
me
mother
had
a
fainting
fit
mademoiselle
he
said
they
have
just
taken
her
was
her
heart
it
i
asked
looking
at
him
he
replied
heart
is
in
a
very
agitated
i
know
how
ill
she
is
i
said
and
not
being
able
to
control
myself
any
longer
i
burst
into
sobs
croizette
helped
me
back
to
my
she
was
very
kind
we
had
known
each
other
from
childhood
and
were
very
fond
of
each
other
nothing
ever
estranged
us
in
spite
of
all
the
malicious
gossip
of
envious
people
and
all
the
little
miseries
due
to
vanity
my
dear
madame
guérard
took
a
cab
and
hurried
away
to
my
mother
to
get
news
for
me
i
put
a
little
more
powder
on
but
the
public
not
knowing
what
was
taking
place
were
annoyed
with
me
thinking
i
was
guilty
of
some
fresh
caprice
and
received
me
still
more
coldly
than
before
it
was
all
the
same
to
me
as
i
was
thinking
of
something
else
i
went
on
saying
mlle
de
words
a
most
stupid
and
tiresome
but
all
the
time
i
sarah
was
waiting
for
news
about
my
mother
i
was
watching
for
the
return
of
petit
the
door
on
the
side
just
a
little
way
i
had
said
to
her
make
a
sign
like
this
if
mamma
is
better
and
like
that
if
she
is
but
i
had
forgotten
which
of
the
signs
was
to
stand
for
better
and
when
at
the
end
of
the
third
act
i
saw
madame
guérard
opening
the
door
and
nodding
her
head
for
i
became
quite
idiotic
it
was
in
the
big
scene
of
the
third
act
when
mlle
de
reproaches
the
duc
de
richelieu
bressant
with
doing
her
such
irreparable
harm
the
duc
replies
did
you
not
say
that
some
one
was
listening
that
some
one
was
hidden
i
exclaimed
guérard
bringing
me
news
the
public
had
not
time
to
understand
for
bressant
went
on
quickly
and
so
saved
the
situation
after
an
unenthusiastic
call
i
heard
that
my
mother
was
better
but
that
she
had
had
a
very
serious
attack
poor
mamma
she
had
thought
me
such
a
fright
when
i
made
my
appearance
on
the
stage
that
her
superb
indifference
had
given
way
to
grievous
astonishment
and
that
in
its
turn
to
rage
on
hearing
a
lady
seated
near
her
say
in
a
jeering
tone
like
a
dried
bone
this
little
bernhardt
i
was
greatly
relieved
on
getting
the
news
and
i
played
my
last
act
with
confidence
the
great
success
of
the
evening
though
was
who
was
charming
as
the
marquise
de
prie
my
success
nevertheless
was
assured
in
the
performances
which
followed
and
it
became
so
marked
that
i
was
accused
of
paying
for
applause
i
laughed
heartily
at
this
and
never
even
contradicted
the
report
as
i
have
a
horror
of
useless
words
i
next
appeared
as
junie
in
with
who
played
admirably
as
nero
in
this
delicious
of
junie
i
obtained
an
immense
and
incredible
success
then
in
i
played
chérubin
in
mariage
de
croizette
played
suzanne
and
it
was
a
real
treat
for
the
public
to
see
that
delightful
creature
play
a
part
so
full
of
gaiety
and
charm
chérubin
was
for
me
the
opportunity
of
a
fresh
success
in
the
month
of
march
perrin
took
it
into
his
head
to
stage
by
octave
feuillet
i
was
then
taking
the
part
of
young
girls
young
princesses
or
boys
my
slight
frame
my
pale
face
my
delicate
aspect
marked
me
out
for
the
time
being
for
the
of
victim
perrin
who
thought
that
the
victims
attracted
pity
and
that
it
was
for
this
reason
i
pleased
my
audiences
cast
the
play
most
ridiculously
he
gave
me
the
of
dalila
the
swarthy
wicked
and
ferocious
princess
and
to
sophie
croizette
he
gave
the
of
the
fair
young
dying
girl
the
piece
with
this
strange
cast
was
destined
to
fail
i
forced
my
character
in
order
to
appear
the
haughty
and
voluptuous
siren
i
stuffed
my
bodice
with
wadding
and
the
hips
under
my
skirts
with
but
i
kept
my
small
thin
sorrowful
face
croizette
was
obliged
to
repress
the
advantages
of
her
bust
by
bands
which
oppressed
and
suffocated
her
but
she
kept
her
pretty
plump
face
with
its
dimples
i
was
obliged
to
put
on
a
strong
voice
she
to
soften
hers
in
fact
it
was
absurd
the
piece
was
a
after
that
i
created
a
pretty
piece
in
verse
by
eugène
manuel
a
very
amusing
thing
in
verse
by
paul
ferrier
in
which
coquelin
and
i
quarrelled
beautifully
then
on
august
i
played
with
immense
success
the
of
andromaque
i
shall
never
forget
the
first
performance
in
which
obtained
a
delirious
triumph
oh
how
fine
he
was
in
his
of
orestes
his
entrance
his
fury
his
madness
and
the
plastic
beauty
of
this
marvellous
artiste
how
magnificent
after
i
played
aricie
in
and
in
this
secondary
it
was
i
who
really
made
the
success
of
the
evening
i
took
such
a
position
in
a
very
short
time
at
the
comédie
that
some
of
the
artistes
began
to
feel
uneasy
and
the
management
shared
their
anxiety
perrin
an
extremely
intelligent
man
whom
i
have
always
remembered
with
great
affection
was
horribly
authoritative
i
was
also
so
that
there
was
always
perpetual
warfare
between
us
he
wanted
to
impose
his
will
on
me
and
i
would
not
submit
to
it
he
was
always
ready
to
laugh
at
my
outbursts
when
they
were
against
the
others
but
he
was
furious
when
they
were
directed
against
himself
as
for
me
i
will
own
that
to
get
perrin
in
a
fury
was
one
of
my
delights
he
stammered
so
when
he
tried
to
talk
quickly
he
who
weighed
every
word
on
ordinary
occasions
the
expression
of
his
eyes
which
was
generally
wavering
grew
irritated
and
deceitful
and
his
pale
face
became
mottled
with
patches
of
colour
his
fury
made
him
take
his
hat
off
and
put
it
on
again
fifteen
times
in
as
many
minutes
and
his
extremely
smooth
hair
stood
on
end
with
this
mad
gallop
of
his
although
i
had
certainly
arrived
at
the
age
of
discretion
i
delighted
in
my
wicked
mischievousness
which
i
always
regretted
after
but
which
i
was
always
ready
to
recommence
and
even
now
after
all
the
days
weeks
months
and
years
that
i
have
lived
since
then
it
still
gives
me
infinite
pleasure
to
play
a
joke
on
any
one
all
the
same
life
at
the
comédie
began
to
affect
my
nerves
i
wanted
to
play
camille
in
ne
badine
pas
avec
the
was
given
to
croizette
i
wanted
to
play
célimène
that
was
perrin
was
very
partial
to
croizette
he
admired
her
and
as
she
was
very
ambitious
she
was
most
thoughtful
and
docile
which
charmed
the
authoritative
old
man
she
always
obtained
everything
she
wanted
and
as
sophie
croizette
was
frank
and
straightforward
she
often
said
to
me
when
i
was
grumbling
as
i
do
be
more
yielding
you
pass
your
time
in
rebelling
i
appear
to
be
doing
everything
that
perrin
wants
me
to
do
but
in
reality
i
make
him
do
all
i
want
him
to
try
the
same
i
accordingly
screwed
up
my
courage
and
went
up
to
see
perrin
he
nearly
always
said
to
me
when
we
met
how
do
you
do
mademoiselle
revolt
are
you
calm
very
calm
i
replied
be
amiable
and
grant
me
what
i
am
going
to
ask
i
tried
to
be
charming
and
spoke
in
my
prettiest
way
he
almost
purred
with
satisfaction
and
was
witty
this
was
no
effort
to
him
as
he
was
naturally
so
and
we
got
on
very
well
together
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
i
then
made
my
petition
me
play
camille
in
ne
badine
pas
avec
impossible
my
dear
child
he
replied
is
playing
then
both
play
it
take
it
in
mademoiselle
croizette
like
spoken
to
her
about
it
and
she
would
not
mind
ought
not
to
have
spoken
to
her
about
not
the
management
does
the
casting
not
the
he
purr
any
more
he
only
growled
as
for
me
i
was
in
a
fury
and
a
few
minutes
later
i
went
out
of
the
room
banging
the
door
after
me
all
this
preyed
on
my
mind
though
and
i
used
to
cry
all
night
i
then
decided
to
take
a
studio
and
devote
myself
to
sculpture
as
i
was
not
able
to
use
my
intelligence
and
my
energy
in
creating
at
the
theatre
as
i
wished
i
gave
myself
up
to
another
art
and
began
working
at
sculpture
with
frantic
enthusiasm
i
soon
made
great
progress
and
started
on
an
enormous
composition
the
i
was
indifferent
now
to
the
theatre
every
morning
at
eight
my
horse
was
brought
round
and
i
went
for
a
ride
and
at
ten
i
was
back
in
my
studio
boulevard
de
clichy
i
was
very
delicate
and
my
health
suffered
from
the
double
effort
i
was
making
i
used
to
vomit
blood
in
the
most
alarming
way
and
for
hours
together
i
was
unconscious
i
never
went
to
the
comédie
except
when
obliged
by
my
duties
there
my
friends
were
seriously
concerned
about
me
and
perrin
was
informed
of
what
was
going
on
finally
incited
by
the
press
and
the
department
of
fine
arts
he
decided
to
give
me
a
to
create
in
octave
play
the
principal
part
was
for
croizette
but
on
hearing
the
play
read
i
thought
the
part
destined
for
me
charming
and
i
resolved
that
it
should
also
be
the
principal
there
would
have
to
be
two
principal
ones
that
was
all
the
rehearsals
went
along
very
smoothly
at
the
start
but
it
soon
became
evident
that
my
was
more
important
than
had
been
imagined
and
friction
soon
began
croizette
herself
got
nervous
perrin
was
annoyed
and
all
this
had
the
effect
of
calming
me
octave
feuillet
a
shrewd
charming
man
extremely
and
slightly
ironical
thoroughly
enjoyed
the
skirmishes
that
took
place
war
was
doomed
to
break
out
however
and
the
first
hostilities
came
from
sophie
croizette
i
always
wore
in
my
bodice
three
or
four
roses
which
were
apt
to
open
under
the
influence
of
the
warmth
and
some
of
the
petals
naturally
fell
one
day
sophie
croizette
slipped
down
full
length
on
the
stage
and
as
she
was
tall
and
not
slim
she
fell
rather
unbecomingly
and
got
up
again
ungracefully
the
stifled
laughter
of
some
of
the
subordinate
persons
present
stung
her
to
the
quick
and
turning
to
me
she
said
your
fault
your
roses
fall
and
make
every
one
slip
i
began
to
laugh
petals
of
my
roses
have
fallen
i
replied
there
they
all
three
are
by
the
on
the
prompt
side
and
you
fell
on
the
side
it
my
fault
therefore
it
is
just
your
own
the
discussion
continued
and
was
rather
heated
on
both
sides
two
clans
were
formed
the
and
the
war
was
declared
not
between
sophie
and
me
but
between
our
respective
admirers
and
detractors
the
rumour
of
these
little
quarrels
spread
in
the
world
outside
the
theatre
and
the
public
too
began
to
form
clans
croizette
had
on
her
side
all
the
bankers
and
all
the
people
who
were
suffering
from
repletion
i
had
all
the
artists
the
students
dying
folks
and
the
failures
when
once
war
was
declared
there
was
no
drawing
back
from
the
strife
the
first
the
most
fierce
and
the
definitive
battle
was
fought
over
the
moon
we
had
begun
the
full
dress
rehearsals
in
the
third
act
the
scene
was
laid
in
a
forest
glade
in
the
middle
of
the
stage
was
a
huge
rock
upon
which
was
blanche
croizette
kissing
savigny
delaunay
who
was
supposed
to
be
my
husband
i
berthe
de
savigny
had
to
arrive
by
a
little
bridge
over
a
stream
of
water
the
glade
was
bathed
in
moonlight
croizette
had
just
played
her
part
and
her
kiss
had
been
greeted
with
a
burst
of
applause
this
was
rather
daring
in
those
days
for
the
comédie
française
but
since
then
what
have
they
not
given
there
suddenly
a
fresh
burst
of
applause
was
heard
amazement
could
be
read
on
some
faces
and
perrin
stood
up
terrified
i
was
crossing
over
the
bridge
my
pale
face
ravaged
with
grief
and
the
de
which
was
intended
to
cover
my
shoulders
was
dragging
along
just
held
by
my
limp
fingers
my
arms
were
hanging
down
as
though
despair
had
taken
the
use
out
of
them
i
was
bathed
in
the
white
light
of
the
moon
and
the
effect
it
seems
was
striking
and
deeply
impressive
a
nasal
aggressive
voice
cried
out
moon
effect
is
enough
turn
it
off
for
mademoiselle
i
sprang
forward
to
the
front
of
the
stage
me
monsieur
perrin
i
exclaimed
have
no
right
to
take
my
moon
away
the
manuscript
reads
advances
pale
convulsed
with
emotion
the
rays
of
the
moon
falling
on
i
am
pale
and
i
am
convulsed
i
must
have
my
is
impossible
roared
perrin
words
love
me
then
and
her
kiss
must
have
this
moonlight
she
is
playing
the
sphinx
that
is
the
chief
part
in
the
play
and
we
must
leave
her
the
principal
well
then
give
croizette
a
brilliant
moon
and
give
me
a
less
brilliant
one
i
mind
that
but
i
must
have
my
all
the
artistes
and
all
the
employés
of
the
theatre
put
their
heads
in
at
all
the
doorways
and
openings
both
on
the
stage
and
in
the
house
itself
the
and
the
began
to
comment
on
the
discussion
octave
feuillet
was
appealed
to
and
he
got
up
in
his
turn
grant
that
mademoiselle
croizette
is
very
beautiful
in
her
moon
effect
mademoiselle
sarah
bernhardt
is
ideal
too
with
her
ray
of
moonlight
i
want
the
moon
therefore
for
both
of
perrin
could
not
control
his
anger
there
was
a
discussion
between
the
author
and
the
director
followed
by
others
between
the
artistes
and
between
the
and
the
journalists
who
were
questioning
him
the
rehearsal
was
interrupted
i
declared
that
i
would
not
play
the
part
if
i
did
not
have
my
moon
for
the
next
two
days
i
received
no
notice
of
another
rehearsal
but
through
croizette
i
heard
that
they
were
trying
my
of
berthe
privately
they
had
given
it
to
a
young
woman
whom
we
had
nicknamed
crocodile
because
she
followed
all
the
rehearsals
just
as
that
animal
follows
boats
she
was
always
hoping
to
snatch
up
some
that
might
happen
to
be
thrown
overboard
octave
feuillet
refused
to
accept
the
change
of
artistes
and
he
came
himself
to
fetch
me
accompanied
by
delaunay
who
had
negotiated
matters
all
settled
he
said
kissing
my
hands
will
be
a
moon
for
both
of
the
first
night
was
a
triumph
both
for
croizette
and
for
me
the
party
strife
between
the
two
clans
waxed
warmer
and
warmer
and
this
added
to
our
success
and
amused
us
both
immensely
for
croizette
was
always
a
delightful
friend
and
a
loyal
comrade
she
worked
for
her
own
ends
but
never
against
any
one
else
after
i
played
a
pretty
piece
in
one
act
by
a
young
pupil
of
the
ecole
polytechnique
louis
denayrouse
belle
this
author
has
now
become
a
renowned
scientific
man
and
has
renounced
poetry
i
had
begged
perrin
to
give
me
a
holiday
but
he
refused
energetically
and
compelled
me
to
take
part
in
the
rehearsals
of
during
the
trying
months
of
june
and
july
and
in
spite
of
my
reluctance
announced
the
first
performance
for
august
that
year
it
was
fearfully
hot
in
paris
i
believe
that
perrin
who
could
not
tame
me
alive
had
without
really
any
bad
intention
but
by
pure
autocracy
the
desire
to
tame
me
dead
doctor
parrot
went
to
see
him
and
told
him
that
my
state
of
weakness
was
such
that
it
would
be
positively
dangerous
for
me
to
act
during
the
trying
heat
perrin
would
hear
nothing
of
it
then
furious
at
the
obstinacy
of
this
intellectual
i
swore
i
would
play
on
to
the
death
often
when
i
was
a
child
i
wished
to
kill
myself
in
order
to
vex
others
i
remember
once
having
drunk
the
contents
of
a
large
after
being
compelled
by
mamma
to
swallow
a
footnote
bread
stewed
a
long
time
in
water
and
flavoured
with
a
little
butter
and
sugar
a
kind
of
given
to
children
in
france
because
she
imagined
that
panades
were
good
for
the
health
our
nurse
had
told
her
my
dislike
to
this
form
of
nourishment
adding
that
every
morning
i
emptied
the
panade
into
the
i
had
of
course
a
very
bad
and
screamed
out
in
pain
i
cried
to
mamma
is
you
who
have
killed
me
and
my
poor
mother
wept
she
never
knew
the
truth
but
they
never
again
made
me
swallow
anything
against
my
will
well
after
so
many
years
i
experienced
the
same
bitter
and
childish
sentiment
care
i
said
shall
certainly
fall
senseless
vomiting
blood
and
perhaps
i
shall
die
and
it
will
serve
perrin
right
he
will
be
furious
yes
that
is
what
i
thought
i
am
at
times
very
foolish
why
i
know
how
to
explain
it
but
i
admit
it
the
of
august
therefore
i
played
in
tropical
heat
the
part
of
zaïre
the
entire
audience
was
bathed
in
perspiration
i
saw
the
spectators
through
a
mist
the
piece
badly
staged
as
regards
scenery
but
very
well
presented
as
regards
costume
was
particularly
well
played
by
orosmane
laroche
nérestan
and
myself
zaïre
and
obtained
an
immense
success
i
was
determined
to
faint
determined
to
vomit
blood
determined
to
die
in
order
to
enrage
perrin
i
played
with
the
utmost
passion
i
had
sobbed
i
had
loved
i
had
suffered
and
i
had
been
stabbed
by
the
poignard
of
orosmane
uttering
a
true
cry
of
suffering
for
i
had
felt
the
steel
penetrate
my
breast
then
falling
panting
dying
on
the
oriental
divan
i
had
meant
to
die
in
reality
and
dared
scarcely
move
my
arms
convinced
as
i
was
that
i
was
in
my
death
agony
and
somewhat
afraid
i
must
admit
at
having
succeeded
in
playing
such
a
nasty
trick
on
perrin
but
my
surprise
was
great
when
the
curtain
fell
at
the
close
of
the
piece
and
i
got
up
quickly
to
answer
to
the
call
and
bow
to
the
audience
without
languor
without
fainting
feeling
strong
enough
to
go
through
my
part
again
if
it
had
been
necessary
and
i
marked
this
performance
with
a
little
white
stone
for
that
day
i
learned
that
my
vital
force
was
at
the
service
of
my
intellectual
force
i
had
desired
to
follow
the
impulse
of
my
brain
whose
conceptions
seemed
to
me
to
be
too
forceful
for
my
physical
strength
to
carry
out
and
i
found
myself
after
having
given
out
all
of
which
i
was
capable
and
more
in
perfect
equilibrium
then
i
saw
the
possibility
of
the
future
i
had
fancied
and
up
to
this
performance
of
i
had
always
heard
and
read
in
the
papers
that
my
voice
was
pretty
but
weak
that
my
gestures
were
gracious
but
vague
that
my
supple
movements
lacked
authority
and
that
my
glance
lost
in
heavenward
contemplation
could
not
tame
the
wild
beasts
the
audience
i
thought
then
of
all
that
i
had
received
proof
that
i
could
rely
on
my
physical
strength
for
i
had
commenced
the
performance
of
in
such
a
state
of
weakness
that
it
was
easy
to
predict
that
i
should
not
finish
the
first
act
without
fainting
on
the
other
hand
although
the
was
easy
it
required
two
or
three
shrieks
which
might
have
provoked
the
vomiting
of
blood
that
frequently
troubled
me
at
that
time
that
evening
therefore
i
acquired
the
certainty
that
i
could
count
on
the
strength
of
my
vocal
cords
for
i
had
uttered
my
shrieks
with
real
rage
and
suffering
hoping
to
break
something
in
my
wild
desire
to
be
revenged
on
perrin
thus
this
little
comedy
turned
to
my
profit
being
unable
to
die
at
will
i
changed
my
batteries
and
resolved
to
be
strong
vivacious
and
active
to
the
great
annoyance
of
some
of
my
contemporaries
who
had
only
put
up
with
me
because
they
thought
i
should
soon
die
but
who
began
to
hate
me
as
soon
as
they
acquired
the
conviction
that
i
should
perhaps
live
for
a
long
time
i
will
only
give
one
example
related
by
alexandre
dumas
who
was
present
at
the
death
of
his
intimate
friend
charles
narrey
and
heard
his
dying
words
am
content
to
die
because
i
shall
hear
no
more
of
sarah
bernhardt
and
of
the
grand
ferdinand
de
lesseps
but
this
revelation
of
my
strength
rendered
more
painful
to
me
the
sort
of
to
which
perrin
condemned
me
in
fact
after
i
remained
months
without
doing
anything
of
importance
playing
only
now
and
again
discouraged
and
disgusted
with
the
theatre
my
passion
for
sculpture
increased
after
my
morning
ride
and
a
light
meal
i
used
to
rush
to
my
studio
where
i
remained
till
the
evening
friends
came
to
see
me
sat
round
me
played
the
piano
sang
politics
were
discussed
for
in
this
modest
studio
i
received
the
most
illustrious
men
of
all
parties
several
ladies
came
to
take
tea
which
was
abominable
and
badly
served
but
i
did
not
care
about
that
i
was
absorbed
by
this
admirable
art
i
saw
nothing
or
to
speak
more
truly
i
see
anything
i
was
making
the
bust
of
an
adorable
young
girl
mlle
emmy
de
her
slow
and
measured
conversation
had
an
infinite
charm
she
was
a
foreigner
but
spoke
french
so
perfectly
that
i
was
stupefied
she
smoked
a
cigarette
all
the
time
and
had
a
profound
disdain
for
those
who
did
not
understand
her
i
made
the
sittings
last
as
long
as
possible
for
i
felt
that
this
delicate
mind
was
imbuing
me
with
her
science
of
seeing
into
the
beyond
and
often
in
the
serious
steps
of
my
life
i
have
said
to
myself
would
emmy
have
done
what
would
she
have
thought
i
was
somewhat
surprised
one
day
by
the
visit
of
adolphe
de
rothschild
who
came
to
give
me
an
order
for
his
bust
i
commenced
the
work
immediately
but
i
had
not
properly
considered
this
admirable
man
he
had
nothing
of
the
aesthetic
but
the
contrary
i
tried
nevertheless
and
i
brought
all
my
will
to
bear
in
order
to
succeed
in
this
first
order
of
which
i
was
so
proud
twice
i
dashed
the
bust
which
i
had
commenced
on
the
ground
and
after
a
third
attempt
i
definitely
gave
up
stammering
idiotic
excuses
which
apparently
did
not
convince
my
model
for
he
never
returned
to
me
when
we
met
in
our
morning
rides
he
saluted
me
with
a
cold
and
rather
severe
bow
after
this
defeat
i
undertook
the
bust
of
a
beautiful
child
miss
multon
a
delightful
little
american
whom
later
on
i
came
across
in
denmark
married
and
the
mother
of
a
family
but
still
as
pretty
as
ever
my
next
bust
was
that
of
mlle
hocquigny
that
admirable
person
who
was
keeper
of
the
linen
in
the
commissariat
during
the
war
and
who
had
so
powerfully
helped
me
and
my
wounded
at
that
time
then
i
undertook
the
bust
of
my
young
sister
régina
who
had
alas
a
weak
chest
a
more
perfect
face
was
never
made
by
the
hand
of
god
two
leonine
eyes
shaded
by
long
long
brown
lashes
a
slender
nose
with
delicate
nostrils
a
tiny
mouth
a
wilful
chin
and
a
pearly
skin
crowned
by
meshes
of
sunrays
for
i
have
never
seen
hair
so
blonde
and
so
pale
so
bright
and
so
silky
but
this
admirable
face
was
without
charm
the
expression
was
hard
and
the
mouth
without
a
smile
i
tried
my
best
to
reproduce
this
beautiful
face
in
marble
but
it
needed
a
great
artist
and
i
was
only
a
humble
amateur
when
i
exhibited
the
bust
of
my
little
sister
it
was
five
months
after
her
death
which
occurred
after
a
six
illness
full
of
false
hopes
i
had
taken
her
to
my
home
no
rue
de
rome
to
the
little
which
i
had
inhabited
since
the
terrible
fire
which
had
destroyed
my
furniture
my
books
my
pictures
and
all
my
scant
possessions
this
flat
in
the
rue
de
rome
was
very
small
my
bedroom
was
quite
tiny
the
big
bamboo
bed
took
up
all
the
room
in
front
of
the
window
was
my
coffin
where
i
frequently
installed
myself
to
study
my
parts
therefore
when
i
took
my
sister
to
my
home
i
found
it
quite
natural
to
sleep
every
night
in
this
little
bed
of
white
satin
which
was
to
be
my
last
couch
and
to
put
my
sister
in
the
big
bamboo
bed
under
the
lace
hangings
she
herself
found
it
quite
natural
also
for
i
would
not
leave
her
at
night
and
it
was
impossible
to
put
another
bed
in
the
little
room
besides
she
was
accustomed
to
my
coffin
one
day
my
manicurist
came
into
the
room
to
do
my
hands
and
my
sister
asked
her
to
enter
quietly
because
i
was
still
asleep
the
woman
turned
her
head
believing
that
i
was
asleep
in
the
but
seeing
me
in
my
coffin
she
rushed
away
shrieking
wildly
from
that
moment
all
paris
knew
that
i
slept
in
my
coffin
and
gossip
with
its
wings
took
flight
in
all
directions
i
was
so
accustomed
to
the
turpitudes
which
were
written
about
me
that
i
did
not
trouble
about
this
but
at
the
death
of
my
poor
little
sister
a
incident
happened
when
the
men
came
to
the
room
to
take
away
the
body
they
found
themselves
confronted
with
two
coffins
and
losing
his
wits
the
master
of
ceremonies
sent
in
haste
for
a
second
hearse
i
was
at
that
moment
with
my
mother
who
had
lost
consciousness
and
i
just
got
back
in
time
to
prevent
the
men
taking
away
my
coffin
the
second
hearse
was
sent
back
but
the
papers
got
hold
of
this
incident
i
was
blamed
criticised
it
really
was
not
my
fault
xxiii
a
descent
into
the
enfer
du
plogoff
my
first
appearance
as
phèdre
the
decoration
of
my
new
mansion
after
the
death
of
my
sister
i
fell
seriously
ill
i
had
tended
her
day
and
night
and
this
in
addition
to
the
grief
i
was
suffering
made
me
anaemic
i
was
ordered
to
the
south
for
two
months
i
promised
to
go
to
mentone
and
i
turned
immediately
towards
brittany
the
country
of
my
dreams
i
had
with
me
my
little
boy
my
steward
and
his
wife
my
poor
guérard
who
had
helped
me
to
tend
my
sister
was
in
bed
ill
with
phlebitis
i
would
much
have
liked
to
have
her
with
me
oh
the
lovely
holiday
that
we
had
there
years
ago
brittany
was
wild
inhospitable
but
as
beautiful
perhaps
more
beautiful
than
at
present
for
it
was
not
furrowed
with
roads
its
green
slopes
were
not
dotted
with
small
white
villas
its
inhabitants
the
men
were
not
dressed
in
the
abominable
modern
trousers
and
the
women
did
not
wear
miserable
little
hats
with
feathers
no
the
bretons
proudly
displayed
their
legs
in
gaiters
or
rough
stockings
their
feet
shod
with
buckled
shoes
their
long
hair
was
brought
down
on
the
temples
hiding
any
awkward
ears
and
giving
to
the
face
a
nobility
which
the
modern
style
does
not
admit
of
the
women
with
their
short
skirts
which
showed
their
slender
ankles
in
black
stockings
and
with
their
small
heads
under
the
wings
of
the
headdress
resembled
i
am
not
speaking
of
course
of
the
inhabitants
of
pont
or
of
bourg
de
batz
who
have
entirely
different
aspects
i
visited
nearly
the
whole
of
brittany
but
made
my
chief
stay
at
finistère
the
pointe
du
raz
enchanted
me
i
remained
twelve
days
at
audierne
in
the
house
of
father
batifoulé
who
was
so
big
and
so
fat
that
they
had
been
obliged
to
cut
a
piece
out
of
the
table
to
let
in
his
immense
abdomen
i
set
out
every
morning
at
ten
my
steward
claude
himself
prepared
my
lunch
which
he
packed
up
very
carefully
in
three
little
baskets
then
climbing
into
the
comical
vehicle
of
father
batifoulé
my
little
boy
driving
we
set
out
for
the
baie
des
trépassés
ah
that
beautiful
and
mysterious
shore
all
bristling
with
rocks
the
lighthouse
keeper
would
be
looking
out
for
me
and
would
come
to
meet
me
claude
gave
him
my
provisions
with
a
thousand
recommendations
as
to
the
manner
of
cooking
the
eggs
warming
up
the
lentils
and
toasting
the
bread
he
carried
off
everything
then
returned
with
two
old
sticks
in
which
he
had
stuck
nails
to
make
them
into
picks
and
we
commenced
the
terrifying
ascent
of
the
pointe
du
raz
a
kind
of
labyrinth
full
of
disagreeable
surprises
of
crevasses
across
which
we
had
to
jump
over
the
gaping
and
roaring
abyss
of
arches
and
tunnels
through
which
we
had
to
crawl
on
all
fours
having
overhead
touching
us
even
a
rock
which
had
fallen
there
in
unknown
ages
and
was
only
held
in
equilibrium
by
some
inexplicable
cause
then
all
at
once
the
path
became
so
narrow
that
it
was
impossible
to
walk
straight
forward
we
had
to
turn
and
put
our
backs
against
the
cliff
and
advance
with
both
arms
spread
out
and
fingers
holding
on
to
the
few
asperities
of
the
rock
when
i
think
of
what
i
did
in
those
moments
i
tremble
for
i
have
always
been
and
still
am
subject
to
dizziness
and
i
went
over
this
path
along
a
steep
precipitous
rock
metres
high
in
the
midst
of
the
infernal
noise
of
the
sea
at
this
place
eternally
furious
and
which
raged
fearfully
against
this
indestructible
cliff
and
i
must
have
taken
a
mad
pleasure
in
it
for
i
accomplished
this
journey
five
times
in
eleven
days
after
this
challenge
thrown
down
to
reason
we
descended
and
installed
ourselves
in
the
baie
des
trépassés
after
a
bath
we
had
lunch
and
i
painted
till
sunset
the
first
day
there
was
nobody
there
the
second
day
a
child
came
to
look
at
us
the
third
day
about
ten
children
stood
around
asking
for
sous
i
was
foolish
enough
to
give
them
some
and
the
following
day
there
were
twenty
or
thirty
boys
some
of
them
from
sixteen
to
eighteen
years
old
seeing
near
my
easel
something
not
particularly
agreeable
i
begged
one
of
them
to
take
it
away
and
throw
it
into
the
sea
and
for
that
i
gave
i
think
fifty
centimes
when
i
came
back
the
following
day
to
finish
my
painting
the
whole
population
of
the
neighbouring
village
had
chosen
this
place
to
relieve
their
corporal
necessities
and
as
soon
as
i
arrived
the
same
boys
but
in
increased
numbers
offered
if
properly
paid
to
take
away
what
they
had
put
there
i
had
the
ugly
band
routed
by
claude
and
the
lighthouse
keeper
and
as
they
took
to
throwing
stones
at
us
i
pointed
my
gun
at
the
little
group
they
fled
howling
only
two
boys
of
six
and
ten
years
of
age
remained
there
we
did
not
take
any
notice
of
them
and
i
installed
myself
a
little
farther
on
sheltered
by
a
rock
which
kept
the
wind
away
the
two
boys
followed
claude
and
the
keeper
lucas
were
on
the
look
out
to
see
that
the
band
did
not
come
back
they
were
stooping
down
over
the
extreme
point
of
the
rock
which
was
above
our
heads
they
seemed
peaceful
when
suddenly
my
young
maid
jumped
up
madame
horrors
they
are
throwing
lice
down
on
us
and
in
fact
the
two
little
had
been
for
the
last
hour
searching
for
all
the
vermin
they
could
find
on
themselves
and
throwing
it
on
us
i
had
the
two
little
beggars
caught
and
they
got
a
correction
there
was
a
crevasse
which
was
called
the
du
i
had
a
wild
desire
to
go
down
this
crevasse
but
the
guardian
dissuaded
me
constantly
giving
as
objections
the
danger
of
slipping
and
his
fear
of
responsibility
in
case
of
accident
i
persisted
nevertheless
in
my
intention
and
after
a
thousand
promises
in
addition
to
a
certificate
to
testify
that
notwithstanding
the
supplications
of
the
guardian
and
the
certainty
of
the
danger
that
i
ran
i
had
persisted
all
the
same
and
after
having
made
a
small
present
of
ten
louis
to
the
good
fellow
i
obtained
facilities
for
descending
the
enfer
du
plogoff
that
is
to
say
a
wide
belt
to
which
a
strong
rope
was
fastened
i
buckled
this
belt
round
my
waist
which
was
then
so
slender
centimetres
that
it
was
necessary
to
make
additional
holes
in
order
to
fasten
it
then
the
guardian
put
on
each
of
my
hands
a
wooden
shoe
the
sole
of
which
was
bordered
with
big
nails
jutting
out
two
centimetres
i
stared
at
these
wooden
shoes
and
asked
for
an
explanation
before
putting
them
on
said
the
guardian
lucas
i
let
you
down
as
you
are
no
fatter
than
a
herring
bone
you
will
get
shaken
about
in
the
crevasse
and
will
risk
breaking
your
bones
while
if
you
have
the
on
your
hands
you
can
protect
yourself
against
the
walls
by
putting
out
your
arms
to
the
right
and
the
left
according
as
you
are
shaken
up
against
them
i
do
not
say
that
you
will
not
have
a
few
bangs
but
that
is
your
own
fault
you
will
go
now
listen
my
little
lady
when
you
are
at
the
bottom
on
the
rock
in
the
middle
mind
you
slip
for
that
is
the
most
dangerous
of
all
if
you
fall
in
the
water
i
will
pull
the
rope
for
sure
but
i
answer
for
anything
in
that
cursed
whirlpool
of
water
you
might
be
caught
between
two
stones
and
it
would
be
no
use
for
me
to
pull
i
should
break
the
rope
and
that
would
be
then
the
man
grew
pale
and
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
he
leaned
towards
me
murmuring
in
a
dreamy
voice
is
the
shipwrecked
ones
who
are
there
under
the
stones
down
there
it
is
they
who
dance
in
the
moonlight
on
the
of
the
it
is
they
who
put
the
slippery
on
the
little
rock
down
there
in
order
to
make
travellers
slip
and
then
they
drag
them
to
the
bottom
of
the
then
looking
me
in
the
eyes
he
said
you
go
down
all
the
same
certainly
père
lucas
i
will
go
down
at
my
little
boy
was
building
forts
and
castles
on
the
sand
with
félicie
only
claude
was
with
me
he
did
not
say
a
word
knowing
my
unbridled
desire
to
meet
danger
he
looked
to
see
if
the
belt
was
properly
fastened
and
asked
my
permission
to
tie
the
tongue
of
the
belt
to
the
belt
itself
then
he
passed
a
strong
cord
several
times
around
to
strengthen
the
leather
and
i
was
let
down
suspended
by
the
rope
in
the
blackness
of
the
crevasse
i
extended
my
arms
to
the
right
and
the
left
as
the
guardian
had
told
me
to
do
and
even
then
i
got
my
elbows
scraped
at
first
i
thought
that
the
noise
i
heard
was
the
reverberation
of
the
echo
of
the
blows
of
the
wooden
shoes
against
the
edges
of
the
crevasse
but
suddenly
a
frightful
din
filled
my
ears
successive
firings
of
cannons
strident
ringings
crackings
of
a
whip
plaintive
howls
and
repeated
monotonous
cries
as
of
a
hundred
fishermen
drawing
up
a
net
filled
with
fish
and
pebbles
all
the
noises
mingled
under
the
mad
violence
of
the
wind
i
became
furious
with
myself
for
i
was
really
afraid
the
lower
i
went
the
louder
the
howlings
became
in
my
ears
and
my
brain
and
my
heart
beat
the
order
of
retreat
the
wind
swept
through
the
narrow
tunnel
and
blew
in
all
directions
round
my
legs
my
body
my
neck
a
horrible
fear
took
possession
of
me
i
descended
slowly
and
at
each
little
shock
i
felt
that
the
four
hands
holding
me
above
had
come
to
a
knot
i
tried
to
remember
the
number
of
knots
for
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
was
making
no
progress
then
i
opened
my
mouth
to
call
out
me
up
but
the
wind
which
danced
in
mad
folly
around
me
filled
my
mouth
and
drove
back
the
words
i
was
nearly
suffocated
then
i
shut
my
eyes
and
ceased
to
struggle
i
would
not
even
put
out
my
arms
a
few
instants
after
i
pulled
up
my
legs
in
unspeakable
terror
the
sea
had
just
seized
them
in
a
brutal
embrace
which
had
wet
me
through
however
i
recovered
courage
for
now
i
could
see
clearly
i
stretched
out
my
legs
and
found
myself
upright
on
the
little
rock
it
is
true
it
was
very
slippery
i
took
hold
of
a
large
ring
fixed
in
the
vault
which
overhung
the
rock
and
i
looked
round
the
long
and
narrow
crevasse
grew
suddenly
wider
at
its
base
and
terminated
in
a
large
grotto
which
looked
out
over
the
open
sea
but
the
entrance
of
this
grotto
was
protected
by
a
quantity
of
both
large
and
small
rocks
which
could
be
seen
for
a
distance
of
a
league
in
front
on
the
surface
of
the
water
which
explains
the
terrible
noise
of
the
sea
dashing
into
the
labyrinth
and
the
possibility
of
standing
upright
on
a
stone
as
the
bretons
say
with
the
wild
dance
of
the
waves
all
around
however
i
saw
very
plainly
that
a
false
step
might
be
fatal
in
the
brutal
whirl
of
waters
which
came
rushing
in
from
afar
with
dizzy
speed
and
broke
against
the
insurmountable
obstacle
and
in
receding
dashed
against
other
waves
which
followed
them
from
this
cause
proceeded
the
perpetual
fusillade
of
waters
which
rushed
into
the
crevasse
without
danger
of
drowning
me
it
now
began
to
grow
dark
and
i
experienced
a
fearful
anguish
in
discovering
on
the
crest
of
a
little
rock
two
enormous
eyes
which
looked
fixedly
at
me
then
a
little
farther
near
a
tuft
of
seaweed
two
more
of
these
fixed
eyes
i
saw
no
body
to
these
beings
nothing
but
the
eyes
i
thought
for
a
minute
that
i
was
losing
my
senses
and
i
bit
my
tongue
till
the
blood
came
then
i
pulled
violently
at
the
rope
as
i
had
agreed
to
do
in
order
to
give
the
signal
for
being
drawn
up
i
felt
the
trembling
joy
of
the
four
hands
pulling
me
and
my
feet
lost
their
hold
as
i
was
hauled
up
by
my
guardians
the
eyes
were
lifted
up
also
uneasy
at
seeing
me
depart
and
while
i
mounted
through
the
air
i
saw
nothing
but
eyes
everywhere
eyes
throwing
out
long
feelers
to
reach
me
i
had
never
seen
an
octopus
and
i
did
not
even
know
of
the
existence
of
these
horrible
beasts
during
the
ascent
which
appeared
to
me
interminable
i
imagined
i
saw
these
beasts
along
the
walls
and
my
teeth
were
chattering
when
i
was
drawn
out
on
to
the
green
hillock
i
immediately
told
the
guardian
the
cause
of
my
terror
and
he
crossed
himself
saying
are
the
eyes
of
the
shipwrecked
ones
no
one
must
stay
there
i
knew
very
well
that
they
were
not
the
eyes
of
shipwrecked
ones
but
i
did
not
know
what
they
were
for
i
thought
i
had
seen
some
strange
beasts
that
no
one
had
ever
seen
before
it
was
only
at
the
hotel
with
père
batifoulé
that
i
learnt
about
the
octopus
only
five
more
holiday
were
left
to
me
and
i
passed
them
at
the
pointe
du
raz
seated
in
a
niche
of
rock
which
has
been
since
named
many
tourists
have
sat
there
since
after
my
holiday
i
returned
to
paris
but
i
was
still
very
weak
and
could
only
take
up
my
work
towards
the
month
of
november
i
played
all
the
pieces
of
my
and
i
was
annoyed
at
not
having
any
new
one
day
perrin
came
to
see
me
in
my
studio
he
began
to
talk
at
first
about
my
busts
he
told
me
that
i
ought
to
do
his
medallion
and
asked
me
incidentally
if
i
knew
the
of
phèdre
up
to
that
time
i
had
only
played
aricie
and
the
part
of
phèdre
seemed
formidable
to
me
i
had
however
studied
it
for
my
own
pleasure
i
know
the
of
phèdre
but
i
think
if
ever
i
had
to
play
it
i
should
die
of
he
laughed
with
his
silly
little
laugh
and
said
to
me
squeezing
my
hand
for
he
was
very
gallant
it
up
i
think
that
you
will
play
in
fact
eight
days
after
i
was
called
to
the
office
and
perrin
told
me
that
he
had
announced
for
december
the
of
racine
with
mlle
sarah
bernhardt
in
the
part
of
phèdre
i
thought
i
should
have
fallen
but
what
about
mademoiselle
rousseil
i
asked
rousseil
wants
the
committee
to
promise
that
she
shall
become
a
sociétaire
in
the
month
of
january
and
the
committee
which
will
without
doubt
appoint
her
refuses
to
make
this
promise
and
declares
that
her
demand
is
like
a
threat
but
perhaps
mademoiselle
rousseil
will
change
her
plans
and
in
that
case
you
will
play
aricie
and
i
will
change
the
coming
out
from
i
ran
up
against
régnier
i
told
him
of
my
conversation
with
the
manager
and
of
my
fears
no
said
the
great
artiste
to
me
must
not
be
afraid
i
see
very
well
what
you
are
going
to
make
of
this
but
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
be
careful
and
not
force
your
voice
make
the
rather
more
sorrowful
than
furious
it
will
be
better
for
every
one
even
then
joining
my
hands
i
said
monsieur
régnier
help
me
to
work
up
phèdre
i
shall
not
be
so
much
afraid
he
looked
at
me
rather
surprised
for
in
general
i
was
neither
docile
nor
apt
to
be
guided
by
advice
i
own
that
i
was
wrong
but
i
could
not
help
it
but
the
responsibility
which
this
put
upon
me
made
me
timid
régnier
accepted
and
made
an
appointment
with
me
for
the
following
morning
at
nine
roselia
rousseil
persisted
in
her
demand
to
the
committee
and
was
billed
for
december
with
mlle
sarah
bernhardt
for
the
first
time
in
the
of
phèdre
this
caused
quite
a
sensation
in
the
artistic
world
and
in
theatrical
circles
that
evening
over
two
hundred
people
were
turned
away
at
the
box
office
when
i
was
informed
of
the
fact
i
began
to
tremble
a
good
deal
régnier
comforted
me
as
best
he
could
saying
cheer
up
are
you
not
the
spoiled
darling
of
the
public
they
will
take
into
consideration
your
inexperience
in
important
leading
parts
these
were
the
last
words
he
should
have
said
to
me
i
should
have
felt
stronger
if
i
had
known
that
the
public
were
come
to
oppose
and
not
to
encourage
me
i
began
to
cry
bitterly
like
a
child
perrin
was
called
and
consoled
me
as
well
as
he
could
then
he
made
me
laugh
by
putting
powder
on
my
face
so
awkwardly
that
i
was
blinded
and
suffocated
everybody
on
the
stage
knew
about
it
and
stood
at
the
door
of
my
wishing
to
comfort
me
who
was
playing
hippolyte
told
me
that
he
had
dreamed
were
playing
and
you
were
hissed
and
my
dreams
always
go
by
contraries
so
he
cried
shall
have
a
tremendous
but
what
put
me
completely
in
a
good
humour
was
the
arrival
of
the
worthy
martel
who
was
playing
théramène
and
who
had
come
so
quickly
believing
me
to
be
ill
that
he
had
not
had
time
to
finish
his
nose
the
sight
of
this
grey
face
with
a
wide
bar
of
red
wax
commencing
between
the
two
eyebrows
coming
down
to
half
a
centimetre
below
his
nose
and
leaving
behind
it
the
end
of
the
nose
with
two
large
black
nostrils
this
face
was
indescribable
and
everybody
laughed
irrepressibly
i
knew
that
martel
made
up
his
nose
for
i
had
already
seen
this
poor
nose
change
shape
at
the
second
performance
of
under
the
tropical
depression
of
the
atmosphere
but
i
had
never
realised
how
much
he
lengthened
it
this
comical
apparition
restored
all
my
gaiety
and
from
thenceforth
i
was
in
full
possession
of
my
faculties
the
evening
was
one
long
triumph
for
me
and
the
press
was
unanimous
in
praise
with
the
exception
of
the
article
of
paul
de
victor
who
was
on
very
good
terms
with
a
sister
of
rachel
and
could
not
get
over
impertinent
presumption
in
daring
to
measure
myself
with
the
great
dead
these
are
his
own
words
addressed
to
girardin
who
immediately
communicated
them
to
me
how
mistaken
he
was
poor
victor
i
had
never
seen
rachel
but
i
worshipped
her
talent
for
i
had
surrounded
myself
with
her
most
devoted
admirers
and
they
little
thought
of
comparing
me
with
their
idol
a
few
days
after
this
performance
of
the
new
piece
of
bornier
was
read
to
us
fille
de
the
part
of
berthe
was
confided
to
me
and
we
immediately
began
the
rehearsals
of
this
fine
piece
the
verses
of
which
were
nevertheless
a
little
flat
though
the
play
rang
with
patriotism
there
was
in
one
act
a
terrible
duel
not
seen
by
the
public
but
related
by
berthe
the
daughter
of
roland
while
the
incidents
happened
under
the
eyes
of
the
unhappy
girl
who
from
a
window
of
the
castle
followed
in
anguish
the
fortunes
of
the
encounter
this
scene
was
the
only
important
one
of
my
the
play
was
ready
to
be
performed
when
bornier
asked
that
his
friend
emile
augier
might
attend
the
dress
rehearsal
when
this
rehearsal
was
over
perrin
came
to
me
he
had
an
affectionate
and
constrained
air
as
to
bornier
he
came
straight
to
me
in
a
decided
and
quarrelsome
manner
emile
augier
followed
him
he
said
to
me
i
looked
straight
at
him
feeling
at
the
moment
that
he
was
my
enemy
he
stopped
short
and
scratched
his
head
then
turned
towards
augier
and
said
beg
you
explain
to
mademoiselle
emile
augier
was
a
broad
man
with
wide
shoulders
and
a
common
appearance
and
was
at
that
time
rather
stout
he
was
in
very
good
repute
at
the
théâtre
français
of
which
he
was
at
that
epoch
the
successful
author
he
came
near
me
managed
the
part
at
the
window
very
well
mademoiselle
but
it
is
ridiculous
it
is
not
your
fault
but
that
of
the
author
who
has
written
a
most
improbable
scene
the
public
would
laugh
immoderately
this
scene
must
be
taken
i
turned
towards
perrin
who
was
listening
silently
you
of
the
same
opinion
sir
talked
it
over
a
short
time
ago
with
these
gentlemen
but
the
author
is
master
to
do
as
he
pleases
with
his
then
addressing
myself
to
bornier
i
said
my
dear
author
what
have
you
decided
little
bornier
looked
at
big
emile
augier
there
was
in
this
beseeching
and
piteous
glance
an
expression
of
sorrow
at
having
to
cut
out
a
scene
which
he
prized
and
of
fear
at
vexing
an
academician
just
at
the
time
when
he
was
hoping
to
become
a
member
of
the
academy
it
out
cut
it
out
or
you
are
done
for
brutally
replied
augier
and
he
turned
his
back
then
poor
bornier
who
resembled
a
breton
gnome
came
up
to
me
he
scratched
himself
desperately
for
the
unfortunate
man
suffered
from
a
distressing
skin
disease
he
did
not
speak
he
looked
at
us
searchingly
poignant
anxiety
was
expressed
on
his
face
perrin
who
had
come
up
to
me
guessed
the
private
little
drama
which
was
taking
place
in
the
heart
of
the
mild
bornier
energetically
murmured
perrin
to
me
i
understood
and
declared
firmly
to
bornier
that
if
this
scene
were
cut
out
i
should
refuse
the
part
then
bornier
seized
both
my
hands
which
he
kissed
ardently
and
running
up
to
augier
he
exclaimed
with
comic
emphasis
i
can
not
cut
it
out
i
can
not
cut
it
out
she
will
not
play
and
the
day
after
the
play
is
to
be
then
as
emile
augier
made
a
gesture
and
would
have
spoken
no
to
put
back
my
play
eight
days
would
be
to
kill
it
i
can
not
cut
it
out
oh
mon
dieu
and
he
cried
and
gesticulated
with
his
two
long
arms
and
he
stamped
with
his
short
legs
his
large
hairy
head
went
from
right
to
left
he
was
at
the
same
time
funny
and
pitiable
emile
augier
was
irritated
and
turned
on
me
like
a
hunted
boar
on
a
pursuing
dog
you
take
the
responsibility
mademoiselle
of
the
absurd
window
scene
on
the
first
performance
monsieur
and
i
even
promise
to
make
of
this
scene
which
i
find
very
beautiful
an
enormous
success
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
rudely
muttering
something
very
disagreeable
between
his
teeth
when
i
left
the
theatre
i
found
poor
bornier
quite
transfigured
he
thanked
me
a
thousand
times
for
he
thought
very
highly
of
this
scene
and
he
dared
not
thwart
emile
augier
both
perrin
and
myself
had
divined
the
legitimate
emotions
of
this
poor
poet
so
gentle
and
so
well
bred
but
a
trifle
jesuitical
the
play
was
an
immense
success
but
the
window
scene
on
the
first
night
was
a
veritable
triumph
it
was
a
short
time
after
the
terrible
war
of
the
play
contained
frequent
allusions
to
it
and
owing
to
the
patriotism
of
the
public
made
an
even
greater
success
than
it
deserved
as
a
play
i
sent
for
emile
augier
he
came
to
my
with
a
surly
air
and
said
to
me
from
the
door
much
the
worse
for
the
public
it
only
proves
that
the
public
is
idiotic
to
make
a
success
of
such
vileness
and
he
disappeared
without
having
even
entered
my
his
outburst
made
me
laugh
and
as
the
triumphant
bornier
had
embraced
me
repeatedly
i
scratched
myself
all
over
two
months
later
i
played
by
this
same
augier
and
i
had
incessant
quarrels
with
him
i
found
the
verses
of
this
play
execrable
coquelin
who
took
the
part
of
my
husband
made
a
great
success
as
for
me
i
was
as
mediocre
as
the
play
itself
which
is
saying
a
great
deal
i
had
been
appointed
a
sociétaire
in
the
month
of
january
and
since
then
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
was
in
prison
for
i
had
undertaken
an
engagement
not
to
leave
the
house
of
molière
for
many
years
this
idea
made
me
sad
it
was
at
instigation
that
i
had
asked
to
become
a
sociétaire
and
now
i
regretted
it
very
much
during
all
the
latter
part
of
the
year
i
only
played
occasionally
my
time
was
then
occupied
in
looking
after
the
building
of
a
pretty
little
mansion
which
i
was
having
erected
at
the
corner
of
the
avenue
de
villiers
and
the
rue
fortuny
a
sister
of
my
grandmother
had
left
me
in
her
will
a
nice
legacy
which
i
used
to
buy
the
ground
my
great
desire
was
to
have
a
house
that
should
be
entirely
my
own
and
i
was
then
realising
it
the
of
régnier
félix
escalier
a
fashionable
architect
was
building
me
a
charming
place
nothing
amused
me
more
than
to
go
with
him
in
the
morning
over
the
unfinished
house
afterwards
i
mounted
the
movable
scaffolds
then
i
went
on
the
roofs
i
forgot
my
worries
of
the
theatre
in
this
new
occupation
the
thing
i
most
desired
just
then
was
to
become
an
architect
when
the
building
was
finished
the
interior
had
to
be
thought
of
i
spent
much
time
in
helping
my
painter
friends
who
were
decorating
the
ceilings
in
my
bedroom
in
my
in
my
hall
georges
clairin
the
architect
escalier
who
was
also
a
talented
painter
duez
picard
butin
jadin
and
parrot
i
was
deeply
interested
and
i
recollect
a
joke
which
i
played
on
one
of
my
relations
my
aunt
betsy
had
come
from
holland
her
native
country
in
order
to
spend
a
few
days
in
paris
she
was
staying
with
my
mother
i
invited
her
to
lunch
in
my
new
unfinished
habitation
five
of
my
painter
friends
were
working
some
in
one
room
some
in
another
and
everywhere
lofty
scaffoldings
were
erected
in
order
to
be
able
to
climb
the
ladders
more
easily
i
was
wearing
my
costume
my
aunt
seeing
me
thus
arrayed
was
horribly
shocked
and
told
me
so
but
i
was
preparing
yet
another
surprise
for
her
she
thought
these
young
workers
were
ordinary
and
considered
i
was
too
familiar
with
them
but
she
nearly
fainted
when
midday
came
and
i
rushed
to
the
piano
to
play
complaint
of
the
hungry
this
wild
melody
had
been
improvised
by
the
group
of
painters
but
revised
and
corrected
by
poet
friends
here
it
is
oh

when
the
song
was
finished
i
went
into
my
bedroom
and
made
myself
into
a
for
lunch
my
aunt
had
followed
me
my
dear
said
she
are
mad
to
think
i
am
going
to
eat
with
all
these
workmen
certainly
in
all
paris
there
is
no
one
but
yourself
who
would
do
such
a
no
aunt
it
is
all
and
i
dragged
her
off
when
i
was
dressed
to
the
which
was
the
most
habitable
room
of
the
house
five
young
men
solemnly
bowed
to
my
aunt
who
did
not
recognise
them
at
first
for
they
had
changed
their
working
clothes
and
looked
like
five
nice
young
society
swells
madame
guérard
lunched
with
us
suddenly
in
the
middle
of
lunch
my
aunt
cried
out
these
are
the
workmen
the
five
young
men
rose
and
bowed
low
then
my
poor
aunt
understood
her
mistake
and
excused
herself
in
every
possible
manner
so
confused
was
she
xxiv
alexandre
dumas
my
sculpture
at
the
salon
one
day
alexandre
dumas
junior
was
announced
he
came
to
bring
me
the
good
news
that
he
had
finished
his
play
for
the
comédie
française
and
that
my
the
duchesse
de
septmonts
had
come
out
very
well
can
he
said
to
me
a
fine
success
out
of
i
expressed
my
gratitude
to
him
a
month
after
this
visit
we
were
requested
to
attend
the
reading
of
this
piece
at
the
comédie
the
reading
was
a
great
success
and
i
was
delighted
with
my
catherine
de
septmonts
i
also
liked
the
of
croizette
clarkson
got
gave
us
each
copies
of
our
parts
and
thinking
that
he
had
made
a
mistake
i
passed
on
to
croizette
the
of
which
he
had
just
given
me
saying
to
her
got
has
made
a
mistake
here
is
your
he
is
not
making
any
mistake
it
is
i
who
am
to
play
the
duchesse
de
i
burst
out
into
irrepressible
laughter
which
surprised
everybody
present
and
when
perrin
annoyed
asked
me
at
whom
i
was
laughing
like
that
i
exclaimed
all
of
you
you
dumas
got
croizette
and
all
of
you
who
are
in
the
plot
and
who
are
all
a
little
afraid
of
the
result
of
your
cowardice
well
you
need
not
alarm
yourselves
i
was
delighted
to
play
the
duchesse
de
septmonts
but
i
shall
be
ten
times
more
delighted
to
play
and
this
time
my
dear
sophie
be
quits
with
you
no
ceremony
i
tell
you
for
you
have
played
me
a
little
trick
which
was
quite
unworthy
of
our
friendship
the
rehearsals
were
strained
on
all
sides
perrin
who
was
a
warm
partisan
of
croizette
bewailed
the
want
of
suppleness
of
her
talent
so
much
so
that
one
day
croizette
losing
all
patience
burst
out
monsieur
you
should
have
left
the
to
sarah
she
would
have
played
it
with
the
voice
you
wish
in
the
love
scenes
i
can
not
do
any
better
you
irritate
me
too
much
i
have
had
enough
of
it
and
she
ran
off
sobbing
into
the
little
where
she
had
an
attack
of
hysteria
i
followed
her
and
consoled
her
as
well
as
i
could
and
in
the
midst
of
her
tears
she
kissed
me
murmuring
is
true
it
is
they
who
instigated
me
to
play
this
nasty
trick
and
now
they
are
annoying
croizette
used
vulgar
expressions
very
vulgar
ones
and
at
times
uttered
many
a
gallic
joke
that
day
we
made
up
our
quarrel
entirely
a
week
before
the
first
performance
i
received
an
anonymous
letter
informing
me
that
perrin
was
trying
his
very
best
to
get
dumas
to
change
the
name
of
the
play
he
wished
it
goes
without
saying
to
have
the
piece
called
duchesse
de
i
rushed
off
to
the
theatre
to
find
perrin
at
once
at
the
entrance
door
i
met
coquelin
who
was
playing
the
part
of
the
duc
de
septmonts
which
he
did
marvellously
well
i
showed
him
the
letter
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
is
infamous
but
why
do
you
take
any
notice
of
an
anonymous
letter
it
is
not
worthy
of
you
we
were
talking
at
the
foot
of
the
staircase
when
the
manager
arrived
show
the
letter
to
perrin
and
he
took
it
from
my
hands
in
order
to
show
it
to
him
perrin
blushed
slightly
know
this
writing
he
said
one
from
the
theatre
has
written
this
i
snatched
it
back
from
him
it
is
some
one
who
is
well
informed
and
what
he
says
is
perhaps
true
is
it
not
so
tell
me
i
have
the
right
to
detest
anonymous
and
he
went
up
the
stairs
bowing
slightly
but
without
saying
anything
further
if
it
is
true
said
coquelin
is
too
much
would
you
like
me
to
go
and
see
dumas
and
i
will
get
to
know
at
once
thank
you
but
you
have
put
an
idea
into
my
head
go
and
shaking
hands
with
him
i
went
off
to
see
the
younger
dumas
he
was
just
going
out
well
what
is
the
matter
your
eyes
are
blazing
i
went
with
him
into
the
and
asked
my
question
at
once
he
had
kept
his
hat
on
and
took
it
off
to
recover
his
and
before
he
could
speak
a
word
i
got
furiously
angry
i
fell
into
one
of
those
rages
which
i
sometimes
have
and
which
are
more
like
attacks
of
madness
and
in
fact
all
that
i
felt
of
bitterness
towards
this
man
towards
perrin
towards
all
this
theatrical
world
that
should
have
loved
me
and
upheld
me
but
which
betrayed
me
on
every
occasion
all
the
hot
anger
that
i
had
been
accumulating
during
the
rehearsals
the
cries
of
revolt
against
the
perpetual
injustice
of
these
two
men
perrin
and
dumas
i
burst
out
with
everything
in
an
avalanche
of
stinging
words
which
were
both
furious
and
sincere
i
reminded
him
of
his
promise
made
in
former
days
of
his
visit
to
my
hotel
in
the
avenue
de
villiers
of
the
cowardly
and
underhand
manner
in
which
he
had
sacrificed
me
at
request
and
on
the
wishes
of
the
friends
of
sophie
i
spoke
vehemently
without
allowing
him
to
edge
in
a
single
word
and
when
worn
out
i
was
forced
to
stop
i
murmured
out
of
breath
with
fatigue
what
what
have
you
to
say
for
yourself
dear
child
he
replied
much
touched
i
had
examined
my
own
conscience
i
should
have
said
to
myself
all
that
you
have
just
said
to
me
so
eloquently
but
i
can
truly
say
in
order
to
excuse
myself
a
little
that
i
really
believed
that
you
did
not
care
at
all
about
the
stage
that
you
much
preferred
your
sculpture
your
painting
and
your
court
we
have
seldom
talked
together
and
people
led
me
to
believe
all
that
i
was
perhaps
too
ready
to
believe
your
grief
and
anger
have
touched
me
deeply
i
give
you
my
word
that
the
play
shall
keep
its
title
of
and
now
embrace
me
with
good
grace
to
show
that
you
are
no
longer
angry
with
i
embraced
him
and
from
that
day
we
were
good
friends
that
evening
i
told
the
whole
tale
to
croizette
and
i
saw
that
she
knew
nothing
about
this
wicked
scheme
i
was
very
pleased
to
know
that
the
play
was
very
successful
coquelin
febvre
and
i
carried
off
the
laurels
of
the
day
i
had
just
commenced
in
my
studio
in
the
avenue
de
clichy
a
large
group
the
inspiration
for
which
i
had
gathered
from
the
sad
history
of
an
old
woman
whom
i
often
saw
at
nightfall
in
the
baie
des
trépassés
one
day
i
went
up
to
her
wishing
to
speak
to
her
but
i
was
so
terrified
by
her
aspect
of
madness
that
i
rushed
off
at
once
and
the
guardian
told
me
her
history
she
was
the
mother
of
five
sons
all
sailors
two
had
been
killed
by
the
germans
in
and
three
had
been
drowned
she
had
brought
up
the
little
son
of
her
youngest
boy
always
keeping
him
far
from
the
sea
and
teaching
him
to
hate
the
water
she
had
never
left
the
little
lad
but
he
became
so
sad
that
he
was
really
ill
and
he
said
he
was
dying
because
he
wanted
to
see
the
sea
make
haste
and
get
well
said
the
grandmother
tenderly
we
will
go
to
see
it
two
days
later
the
child
was
better
and
the
grandmother
left
the
valley
in
the
company
of
her
little
grandson
to
go
and
see
the
ocean
the
grave
of
her
three
sons
it
was
a
november
day
a
low
sky
hung
over
the
ocean
narrowing
the
horizon
the
child
jumped
with
joy
he
ran
gambolled
and
sang
for
happiness
when
he
saw
all
this
living
water
the
grandmother
sat
on
the
sand
and
hid
her
tearful
eyes
in
her
two
trembling
hands
then
suddenly
struck
by
the
silence
she
looked
up
in
terror
there
in
front
of
her
she
saw
a
boat
drifting
and
in
the
boat
her
boy
her
little
lad
of
eight
years
old
who
was
laughing
right
merrily
paddling
as
well
as
he
could
with
one
oar
that
he
could
hardly
hold
and
crying
out
am
going
to
see
what
there
is
behind
the
mist
and
i
will
come
he
never
came
back
and
the
following
day
they
found
the
poor
old
woman
talking
low
to
the
waves
which
came
and
bathed
her
feet
she
came
every
day
to
the
edge
throwing
in
the
bread
which
kind
folks
gave
her
and
saying
to
the
waves
must
carry
that
to
the
little
this
touching
narrative
had
remained
in
my
memory
i
can
still
see
the
tall
old
woman
with
her
brown
cape
and
hood
i
worked
feverishly
at
this
group
it
seemed
to
me
now
that
i
was
destined
to
be
a
sculptor
and
i
began
to
despise
the
stage
i
only
went
to
the
theatre
when
i
was
compelled
by
my
duties
and
i
left
as
soon
as
possible
i
had
made
several
designs
none
of
which
pleased
me
just
when
i
was
going
to
throw
down
the
last
one
in
discouragement
the
painter
georges
clairin
who
came
in
just
at
that
moment
to
see
me
begged
me
not
to
do
so
and
my
good
friend
mathieu
meusnier
who
was
a
man
of
talent
also
added
his
voice
against
the
destruction
of
my
design
excited
by
their
encouragement
i
decided
to
hurry
on
with
the
work
and
to
make
a
large
group
i
asked
meusnier
if
he
knew
any
tall
bony
old
woman
and
he
sent
me
two
neither
of
whom
suited
me
then
i
asked
all
my
painter
and
sculptor
friends
and
during
eight
days
all
sorts
of
old
and
infirm
women
came
for
my
inspection
i
fixed
at
last
on
a
charwoman
who
was
about
sixty
years
old
she
was
very
tall
and
had
very
features
when
she
came
in
i
felt
a
slight
sentiment
of
fear
the
idea
of
remaining
alone
with
this
female
for
hours
together
made
me
feel
uneasy
but
when
i
heard
her
speak
i
was
more
comfortable
her
timid
gentle
voice
and
frightened
gestures
like
a
shy
young
girl
contrasted
strangely
with
the
build
of
the
poor
woman
when
i
showed
her
the
design
she
was
stupefied
you
want
me
to
have
my
neck
and
shoulders
bare
i
really
can
not
i
told
her
that
nobody
ever
came
in
when
i
worked
and
i
asked
to
see
her
neck
immediately
oh
that
neck
i
clapped
my
hands
with
joy
when
i
saw
it
it
was
long
emaciated
terrible
the
bones
literally
stood
out
almost
bare
of
flesh
the
was
remarkable
it
was
just
what
i
wanted
i
went
up
to
her
and
gently
bared
her
shoulder
what
a
treasure
i
had
found
the
shoulder
bone
was
visible
under
the
skin
and
she
had
two
immense
the
woman
was
ideal
for
my
work
she
seemed
destined
for
it
she
blushed
when
i
told
her
so
i
asked
to
see
her
feet
she
took
off
her
thick
boots
and
showed
a
dirty
foot
which
had
no
character
i
said
you
your
feet
are
too
small
i
will
take
only
your
head
and
after
having
fixed
the
price
i
engaged
her
for
three
months
at
the
idea
of
earning
so
much
money
for
three
months
the
poor
woman
began
to
cry
and
i
felt
so
sorry
for
her
that
i
told
her
she
would
not
have
to
seek
for
work
that
winter
because
she
had
already
told
me
that
she
generally
spent
six
months
of
the
year
in
the
country
in
sologne
near
her
grandchildren
having
found
the
grandmother
i
now
needed
the
child
i
passed
a
review
of
a
whole
army
of
professional
italian
models
there
were
some
lovely
children
real
little
jupins
the
mothers
undressed
their
children
in
a
second
and
the
children
posed
quite
naturally
and
took
attitudes
which
showed
off
their
muscles
and
the
development
of
the
torso
i
chose
a
fine
little
boy
of
seven
years
old
but
who
looked
more
like
nine
i
had
already
had
in
the
workmen
who
had
followed
out
my
design
and
put
up
the
scaffolding
necessary
to
make
my
work
sufficiently
stable
and
to
support
the
weight
enormous
iron
supports
were
fixed
into
the
plaster
by
bolts
and
pillars
of
wood
and
iron
wherever
necessary
the
skeleton
of
a
large
piece
of
sculpture
looks
like
a
giant
trap
put
up
to
catch
rats
and
mice
by
the
thousand
i
gave
myself
up
to
this
enormous
work
with
the
courage
of
ignorance
nothing
discouraged
me
often
i
worked
on
till
midnight
sometimes
till
four
in
the
morning
and
as
one
humble
was
totally
insufficient
to
work
by
i
had
a
crown
or
rather
a
silver
circlet
made
each
bud
of
which
was
a
candlestick
and
each
had
its
candle
burning
and
those
of
the
back
row
were
a
little
higher
than
those
of
the
front
and
with
this
help
i
was
able
to
work
almost
without
ceasing
i
had
no
watch
or
clock
in
the
room
as
i
wished
to
ignore
time
altogether
except
on
the
days
i
had
to
perform
at
the
theatre
then
my
maid
would
come
and
call
for
me
how
many
times
have
i
gone
without
lunch
or
dinner
then
i
would
perhaps
faint
and
so
be
compelled
to
send
for
something
to
eat
to
restore
my
strength
i
had
almost
finished
my
group
but
i
had
done
neither
the
feet
nor
the
hands
of
the
grandmother
she
was
holding
her
little
dead
grandson
on
her
knees
but
her
arms
had
no
hands
and
her
legs
had
no
feet
i
looked
in
vain
for
the
hands
and
feet
of
my
ideal
large
and
bony
one
day
when
my
friend
martel
came
to
see
me
at
my
studio
and
to
look
at
this
group
which
was
much
talked
of
i
had
an
inspiration
martel
was
big
and
thin
enough
to
make
death
jealous
i
watched
him
walking
round
my
work
he
was
looking
at
it
as
a
but
i
was
looking
at
suddenly
i
said
dear
martel
i
beg
you
i
beseech
you
to
pose
for
the
hands
and
feet
of
my
grandmother
he
burst
out
laughing
and
with
perfectly
good
grace
he
took
off
his
shoes
and
took
the
place
of
my
model
he
came
ten
days
in
succession
and
gave
me
three
hours
each
day
thanks
to
him
i
was
able
to
finish
my
group
i
had
it
moulded
and
sent
to
the
salon
where
it
met
with
genuine
success
is
there
any
need
to
say
that
i
was
accused
of
having
got
some
one
else
to
make
this
group
for
me
i
sent
a
summons
to
one
critic
he
was
no
other
than
jules
claretie
who
had
declared
that
this
work
which
was
very
interesting
could
not
have
been
done
by
me
jules
claretie
apologised
very
politely
and
that
was
the
end
of
it
the
jury
after
a
full
investigation
awarded
me
an
mention
and
i
was
wild
with
joy
i
was
very
much
criticised
but
also
very
much
praised
nearly
all
the
criticisms
referred
to
the
neck
of
my
old
breton
woman
that
neck
on
which
i
had
worked
with
such
eagerness
the
following
is
from
an
article
by
rené
delorme
work
of
mlle
sarah
bernhardt
deserves
to
be
studied
in
detail
the
head
of
the
grandmother
well
worked
out
as
to
the
profound
wrinkles
it
bears
expresses
that
intense
sorrow
in
which
everything
else
counts
as
nothing
only
reproach
i
have
to
make
against
this
artist
is
that
she
has
brought
too
much
into
prominence
the
muscles
of
the
neck
of
the
old
grandmother
this
shows
a
lack
of
experience
she
is
pleased
with
herself
for
having
studied
anatomy
so
well
and
is
not
sorry
for
the
opportunity
of
showing
it
it
is
certainly
this
gentleman
was
right
i
had
studied
anatomy
eagerly
and
in
a
very
amusing
manner
i
had
had
lessons
from
doctor
parrot
who
was
so
good
to
me
i
had
continually
with
me
a
book
of
anatomical
designs
and
when
i
was
at
home
i
stood
before
the
glass
and
said
suddenly
to
myself
putting
my
finger
on
some
part
of
my
body
then
what
is
that
i
had
to
answer
immediately
without
hesitation
and
when
i
hesitated
i
compelled
myself
to
learn
by
heart
the
muscles
of
the
head
or
the
arm
and
did
not
sleep
till
this
was
done
a
month
after
the
exhibition
there
was
a
reading
of
play
at
the
comédie
française
i
refused
the
of
the
young
vestal
opimia
which
had
been
allotted
to
me
and
energetically
demanded
that
of
posthumia
an
old
blind
roman
woman
with
a
superb
and
noble
face
no
doubt
there
was
some
connection
in
my
mind
between
my
old
breton
weeping
over
her
grandson
and
the
august
patrician
claiming
forgiveness
for
her
perrin
was
at
first
astounded
afterwards
he
acceded
to
my
request
but
his
mind
and
his
taste
for
symmetry
made
him
anxious
about
who
was
also
playing
in
the
piece
he
was
accustomed
to
seeing
and
me
playing
the
two
heroes
the
two
lovers
the
two
victims
how
was
he
to
arrange
matters
so
that
we
should
still
be
the
two
something
or
other
there
was
in
the
play
an
old
idiot
named
vestaepor
who
was
quite
unnecessary
for
the
action
of
the
piece
but
had
been
brought
in
to
satisfy
perrin
cried
the
director
of
the
comédie
shall
play
vestaepor
equilibrium
was
restored
the
god
of
the
was
content
the
piece
which
was
really
quite
mediocre
obtained
a
great
success
at
the
first
performance
september
and
personally
i
was
very
successful
in
the
fourth
act
the
public
was
decidedly
in
my
favour
in
spite
of
everything
and
everybody
xxv
a
trip
in
a
balloon
the
performances
of
made
me
a
still
greater
favourite
with
the
public
i
had
already
rehearsed
with
victor
hugo
and
it
was
a
real
pleasure
to
me
to
see
the
great
poet
almost
each
day
i
had
never
discontinued
my
visits
but
i
was
never
able
to
have
any
conversation
with
him
in
his
own
house
there
were
always
men
in
red
ties
gesticulating
or
women
in
tears
reciting
he
was
very
good
he
used
to
listen
with
eyes
and
i
thought
he
was
asleep
then
roused
by
the
silence
he
would
say
a
consoling
word
for
victor
hugo
could
not
promise
without
keeping
his
word
he
was
not
like
me
i
promise
everything
with
the
firm
intention
of
keeping
my
promises
and
two
hours
after
i
have
forgotten
all
about
them
if
any
one
reminds
me
of
what
i
have
promised
i
tear
my
hair
and
to
make
up
for
my
forgetfulness
i
say
anything
i
buy
presents
in
fact
i
complicate
my
life
with
useless
worries
it
has
always
been
thus
and
always
will
be
so
as
was
i
grumbling
one
day
to
victor
hugo
that
i
never
could
have
a
chance
of
talking
with
him
he
invited
me
to
lunch
saying
that
after
lunch
we
could
talk
together
alone
i
was
delighted
with
this
lunch
to
which
paul
meurice
the
poet
léon
cladel
the
communard
dupuis
a
russian
lady
whose
name
i
do
not
remember
and
gustave
doré
were
also
invited
in
front
of
victor
hugo
sat
madame
drouet
the
friend
of
his
unlucky
days
but
what
a
horrible
lunch
we
had
it
was
really
bad
and
badly
served
my
feet
were
frozen
by
the
draughts
from
the
three
doors
which
fitted
badly
and
one
could
positively
hear
the
wind
blowing
under
the
table
near
me
was
a
german
socialist
who
is
a
very
successful
man
this
man
had
such
dirty
hands
and
ate
in
such
a
way
that
he
made
me
feel
sick
i
met
him
afterwards
at
berlin
he
is
now
quite
clean
and
proper
and
i
believe
an
imperialist
but
the
uncomfortable
feeling
this
uncongenial
neighbour
inspired
in
me
the
cold
draughts
blowing
on
my
feet
mortal
boredom
all
this
reduced
me
to
a
state
of
positive
suffering
and
i
lost
consciousness
when
i
recovered
i
found
myself
on
a
couch
my
hand
in
that
of
madame
drouet
and
in
front
of
me
sketching
me
gustave
doré
move
he
exclaimed
are
so
pretty
like
that
these
words
though
they
were
so
inappropriate
pleased
me
nevertheless
and
i
complied
with
the
wish
of
the
great
artist
who
was
one
of
my
friends
i
left
the
house
of
victor
hugo
without
saying
to
him
a
trifle
ashamed
of
myself
the
next
day
he
came
to
see
me
i
told
him
some
tale
to
account
for
my
illness
and
i
saw
no
more
of
him
except
at
the
rehearsals
of
the
first
performance
of
took
place
on
november
it
was
a
triumph
alike
for
the
author
and
the
actors
had
already
been
played
ten
years
earlier
but
delaunay
who
then
took
the
part
of
hernani
was
the
exact
contrary
of
what
this
part
should
have
been
he
was
neither
epic
romantic
nor
poetic
he
had
not
the
style
of
those
grand
epic
poems
he
was
charming
graceful
and
wore
a
perpetual
smile
of
middle
height
with
studied
movements
he
was
ideal
in
musset
perfect
in
emile
augier
charming
in
molière
but
execrable
in
victor
hugo
bressant
who
took
the
part
of
charles
quint
was
shockingly
bad
his
amiable
and
flabby
style
and
his
weak
and
wandering
eyes
effectively
prevented
all
grandeur
his
two
enormous
feet
generally
half
hidden
under
his
trousers
assumed
immense
proportions
i
could
see
nothing
else
they
were
very
large
flat
and
slightly
turned
in
at
the
toes
they
were
a
nightmare
but
think
of
their
possessor
repeating
the
admirable
couplet
of
charles
quint
to
the
shade
of
charlemagne
it
was
absurd
the
public
coughed
wriggled
and
showed
that
they
found
the
whole
thing
painful
and
ridiculous
in
our
performance
it
was
in
all
the
splendour
of
his
talent
who
played
hernani
and
it
was
worms
that
admirable
artiste
who
played
charles
quint
and
how
well
he
took
the
part
how
he
rolled
out
the
lines
what
a
splendid
diction
he
had
this
performance
of
november
was
a
triumph
i
came
in
for
a
good
share
in
the
general
success
i
played
dona
sol
victor
hugo
sent
me
the
following
letter
you
have
been
great
and
charming
you
have
moved
me
me
the
old
combatant
and
at
one
moment
while
the
public
whom
you
had
enchanted
cheered
you
i
wept
this
tear
which
you
caused
me
to
shed
is
yours
and
i
place
myself
at
your
feet
with
this
letter
came
a
small
box
containing
a
fine
chain
bracelet
from
which
hung
one
diamond
drop
i
lost
this
bracelet
at
the
house
of
the
rich
nabob
alfred
sassoon
he
wanted
to
give
me
another
but
i
refused
he
could
not
give
me
back
the
tear
of
victor
hugo
my
success
at
the
comédie
was
assured
and
the
public
treated
me
as
a
spoiled
child
my
comrades
were
a
little
jealous
of
me
perrin
made
trouble
for
me
at
every
turn
he
had
a
sort
of
friendship
for
me
but
he
would
not
believe
that
i
could
get
on
without
him
and
as
he
always
refused
to
do
as
i
wanted
i
did
not
go
to
him
for
anything
i
used
to
send
a
letter
to
the
ministry
and
i
always
won
my
cause
as
i
had
a
continual
thirst
for
what
was
new
i
now
tried
my
hand
at
painting
i
knew
how
to
draw
a
little
and
had
a
sense
of
colour
i
first
did
two
or
three
small
pictures
then
i
undertook
the
portrait
of
my
dear
guérard
alfred
stevens
thought
it
was
vigorously
done
and
georges
clairin
encouraged
me
to
continue
with
painting
then
i
launched
out
courageously
boldly
i
began
a
picture
which
was
nearly
two
metres
in
size
young
girl
and
then
came
a
cry
of
indignation
against
me
why
did
i
want
to
do
anything
else
but
act
since
that
was
my
career
why
did
i
always
want
to
be
before
the
public
perrin
came
to
see
me
one
day
when
i
was
very
ill
he
began
to
preach
are
killing
yourself
my
dear
child
he
said
do
you
go
in
for
sculpture
painting
c
is
it
to
prove
that
you
can
do
it
no
no
i
answered
is
merely
to
create
a
necessity
for
staying
understand
said
perrin
listening
very
attentively
is
how
it
is
i
have
a
wild
desire
to
travel
to
see
something
else
to
breathe
another
air
and
to
see
skies
that
are
higher
than
ours
and
trees
that
are
bigger
something
different
in
short
i
have
therefore
had
to
create
for
myself
some
tasks
which
will
hold
me
to
my
chains
if
i
did
not
do
this
i
feel
that
my
desire
to
see
other
things
in
the
world
would
win
the
day
and
i
should
do
something
this
conversation
was
destined
to
go
against
me
some
years
later
when
the
comédie
brought
a
against
me
the
exhibition
of
put
the
finishing
stroke
to
the
state
of
exasperation
that
perrin
and
some
of
the
artistes
of
the
theatre
had
conceived
against
me
they
blamed
me
for
everything
for
my
painting
my
sculpture
and
my
health
i
had
a
terrible
scene
with
perrin
and
it
was
the
last
one
for
from
that
time
forth
we
did
not
speak
to
each
other
again
a
formal
bow
was
the
most
that
we
exchanged
afterwards
the
climax
was
reached
over
my
balloon
ascension
i
adored
and
i
still
adore
balloons
every
day
i
went
up
in
captive
balloon
this
persistency
had
struck
the
and
he
asked
a
mutual
friend
to
introduce
him
monsieur
giffard
i
said
i
should
like
to
go
up
in
a
balloon
that
is
not
captive
mademoiselle
you
shall
do
so
if
you
like
he
replied
very
kindly
i
asked
day
you
i
should
have
liked
to
start
immediately
but
as
he
pointed
out
he
would
have
to
fit
the
balloon
up
and
it
was
a
great
responsibility
for
him
to
undertake
we
therefore
fixed
upon
the
following
tuesday
just
a
week
from
then
i
asked
giffard
to
say
nothing
about
it
for
if
the
newspapers
should
get
hold
of
this
piece
of
news
my
terrified
family
would
not
allow
me
to
go
tissandier
who
a
little
time
after
was
doomed
poor
fellow
to
be
killed
in
a
balloon
accident
promised
to
accompany
me
something
happened
however
to
prevent
his
going
with
me
and
it
was
young
godard
who
the
following
week
accompanied
me
in
the
sol
a
beautiful
balloon
specially
prepared
for
my
expedition
prince
jerome
napoleon
who
was
with
me
when
giffard
was
introduced
insisted
on
going
with
us
but
he
was
heavy
and
rather
clumsy
and
i
did
not
care
much
about
his
conversation
in
spite
of
his
marvellous
wit
for
he
was
spiteful
and
rather
delighted
when
he
could
get
a
chance
to
attack
the
emperor
napoleon
whom
i
liked
very
much
we
started
alone
georges
clairin
godard
and
i
the
rumour
of
our
journey
had
spread
but
too
late
for
the
press
to
get
hold
of
the
news
i
had
been
up
in
the
air
about
five
minutes
when
one
of
my
friends
comte
de
m
met
perrin
on
the
bridge
say
he
began
up
in
the
sky
there
is
your
star
shooting
perrin
gazed
up
and
pointing
to
the
balloon
which
was
rising
he
asked
is
in
that
bernhardt
replied
my
friend
perrin
it
appears
turned
purple
and
clenching
his
teeth
he
murmured
another
of
her
freaks
but
she
will
pay
for
he
hurried
away
without
even
saying
to
my
young
friend
who
stood
there
stupefied
at
this
unreasonable
burst
of
anger
and
if
he
had
suspected
my
infinite
joy
at
thus
travelling
through
the
air
perrin
would
have
suffered
still
more
ah
our
departure
it
was
five
i
shook
hands
with
a
few
friends
my
family
whom
i
had
kept
in
the
most
profound
ignorance
was
not
there
i
felt
my
heart
tighten
somewhat
when
after
the
words
her
go
i
found
myself
in
about
a
second
some
fifty
yards
above
the
earth
i
still
heard
a
few
cries
come
back
let
her
be
killed
and
then
nothing
more
nothing
there
was
the
sky
above
and
the
earth
beneath
then
suddenly
i
was
in
the
clouds
i
had
left
a
misty
paris
i
now
breathed
under
a
blue
sky
and
saw
a
radiant
sun
around
us
were
opaque
mountains
of
clouds
with
irradiated
edges
our
balloon
plunged
into
a
milky
vapour
quite
warm
from
the
sun
it
was
splendid
it
was
stupefying
not
a
sound
not
a
breath
but
the
balloon
was
scarcely
moving
at
all
it
was
only
towards
six
that
the
currents
of
air
caught
us
and
we
took
our
flight
towards
the
east
we
were
at
an
altitude
of
about
metres
the
spectacle
became
fairylike
large
fleecy
clouds
were
spread
below
us
like
a
carpet
large
orange
curtains
fringed
with
violet
came
down
from
the
sun
to
lose
themselves
in
our
cloudy
carpet
at
twenty
minutes
to
seven
we
were
about
metres
above
the
earth
and
cold
and
hunger
commenced
to
make
themselves
felt
the
dinner
was
copious
we
had
fresh
bread
and
oranges
the
cork
of
our
champagne
bottle
flew
up
into
the
clouds
with
a
pretty
soft
noise
we
raised
our
glasses
in
honour
of
giffard
we
had
talked
a
great
deal
night
began
to
put
on
her
heavy
dark
mantle
it
became
very
cold
we
were
then
at
metres
and
i
had
a
singing
in
my
ears
my
nose
began
to
bleed
i
felt
very
uncomfortable
and
began
to
get
drowsy
without
being
able
to
prevent
it
georges
clairin
got
anxious
and
young
godard
cried
out
loudly
to
wake
me
up
no
doubt
come
we
shall
have
to
go
down
let
us
throw
out
the
this
cry
woke
me
up
i
wanted
to
know
what
a
was
i
got
up
feeling
rather
stupefied
and
in
order
to
rouse
me
godard
put
the
into
my
hands
it
was
a
strong
rope
of
about
metres
long
to
which
were
attached
at
certain
distances
little
iron
hooks
clairin
and
i
let
out
the
rope
laughing
while
godard
bending
over
the
side
of
the
car
was
looking
through
a
he
cried
suddenly
are
a
lot
of
trees
we
were
over
the
wood
of
ferrières
but
just
in
front
of
us
there
was
a
little
open
ground
suitable
for
our
descent
is
no
doubt
about
it
cried
godard
we
miss
this
plain
we
shall
come
down
in
the
dead
of
night
in
the
wood
of
ferrières
and
that
will
be
very
dangerous
then
turning
to
me
you
he
said
the
valve
i
immediately
did
so
and
the
gas
came
out
of
its
prison
whistling
a
mocking
air
the
valve
was
shut
by
order
of
the
aeronaut
and
we
descended
rapidly
suddenly
the
stillness
of
the
night
was
broken
by
the
sound
of
a
horn
i
trembled
it
was
louis
godard
who
had
pulled
out
of
his
pocket
which
was
a
veritable
storehouse
a
sort
of
horn
on
which
he
blew
with
violence
a
loud
whistle
answered
our
call
and
metres
below
us
we
saw
a
man
who
was
shouting
his
hardest
to
make
us
hear
as
we
were
very
close
to
a
little
station
we
easily
guessed
that
this
man
was
the
are
we
cried
louis
godard
through
his
horn
in
in
ille
answered
the
it
was
impossible
to
understand
are
we
thundered
georges
clairin
in
his
most
formidable
tones
in
in
ille
shouted
the
with
his
hand
curved
round
his
mouth
are
we
cried
i
in
my
most
crystalline
accents
in
in
ille
answered
the
and
his
porters
it
was
impossible
to
get
to
know
anything
we
had
to
lower
the
balloon
at
first
we
descended
rather
too
quickly
and
the
wind
blew
us
towards
the
wood
we
had
to
go
up
again
but
ten
minutes
later
we
opened
the
valve
again
and
made
a
fresh
descent
the
balloon
was
then
to
the
right
of
the
station
and
far
from
the
amiable
out
the
anchor
cried
young
godard
in
a
commanding
tone
and
assisted
by
georges
clairin
he
threw
out
into
space
another
rope
to
the
end
of
which
was
fastened
a
formidable
anchor
the
rope
was
metres
long
down
below
us
a
crowd
of
children
of
all
ages
had
been
running
ever
since
we
stopped
above
the
station
when
we
got
to
about
metres
from
earth
godard
called
out
to
them
are
we
vachère
none
of
us
knew
vachère
but
we
descended
nevertheless
you
fellows
down
there
take
hold
of
the
rope
dragging
cried
the
aeronaut
mind
you
pull
too
hard
five
vigorous
men
seized
hold
of
the
rope
we
were
metres
from
the
ground
and
the
sight
was
becoming
interesting
darkness
began
to
blot
out
everything
i
raised
my
head
to
see
the
sky
but
i
remained
with
my
mouth
open
with
astonishment
i
saw
only
the
lower
end
of
our
balloon
which
was
overhanging
its
base
all
loose
and
baggy
it
was
very
ugly
we
anchored
gently
without
the
little
dragging
which
i
had
hoped
would
happen
and
without
the
little
drama
which
i
had
half
expected
it
began
to
rain
in
torrents
as
we
left
the
balloon
the
young
owner
of
a
neighbouring
château
ran
up
like
the
peasants
to
see
what
was
going
on
he
offered
me
his
umbrella
i
am
so
thin
i
can
not
get
wet
i
pass
between
the
the
saying
was
repeated
and
had
a
great
success
time
is
there
a
train
asked
godard
you
have
plenty
of
time
answered
an
oily
and
heavy
voice
can
not
leave
before
ten
as
the
station
is
a
long
way
from
here
and
in
such
weather
it
will
take
madame
two
hours
to
walk
i
was
confounded
and
looked
for
the
young
gentleman
with
the
umbrella
which
i
could
have
used
as
as
neither
clairin
nor
godard
had
one
but
just
as
i
was
accusing
him
of
going
away
and
leaving
us
he
jumped
lightly
out
of
a
vehicle
which
i
had
not
heard
drive
up
said
he
is
a
carriage
for
you
and
these
gentlemen
and
another
for
the
body
of
the
foi
you
have
saved
us
said
clairin
clasping
his
hand
it
appears
the
roads
are
in
a
very
bad
said
the
young
man
would
be
impossible
for
the
feet
of
parisians
to
walk
even
half
the
then
he
bowed
and
wished
us
a
pleasant
journey
rather
more
than
an
hour
later
we
arrived
at
the
station
of
emerainville
the
learning
who
we
were
received
us
in
a
very
friendly
manner
he
made
his
apologies
for
not
having
heard
when
we
called
out
an
hour
previously
from
our
floating
vehicle
we
had
a
frugal
meal
of
bread
cheese
and
cider
set
before
us
i
have
always
detested
cheese
and
would
never
eat
it
there
is
nothing
poetical
about
it
but
i
was
dying
with
hunger
it
taste
it
said
georges
clairin
i
bit
a
morsel
off
and
found
it
excellent
we
got
back
very
late
in
the
middle
of
the
night
and
i
found
my
household
in
an
extreme
state
of
anxiety
our
friends
who
had
come
to
hear
news
of
us
had
stayed
there
was
quite
a
crowd
i
was
somewhat
annoyed
at
this
as
i
was
half
dead
with
fatigue
i
sent
everybody
away
rather
sharply
and
went
up
to
my
room
as
my
maid
was
helping
me
to
undress
she
told
me
that
some
one
had
come
for
me
from
the
comédie
française
several
times
mon
dieu
i
cried
anxiously
the
piece
have
been
changed
i
think
so
said
the
maid
it
appears
that
monsieur
perrin
is
furious
and
that
they
are
all
in
a
rage
with
you
here
is
the
note
which
was
left
for
i
opened
the
letter
i
was
requested
to
call
on
the
manager
the
following
day
at
two
on
my
arrival
at
at
the
time
appointed
i
was
received
with
exaggerated
politeness
which
had
an
undercurrent
of
severity
then
commenced
a
series
of
recriminations
about
my
fits
of
my
caprices
my
eccentricities
and
he
finished
his
speech
by
saying
that
i
had
incurred
a
fine
of
one
thousand
francs
for
travelling
without
the
consent
of
the
management
i
burst
out
laughing
case
of
a
balloon
has
not
been
foreseen
i
said
i
vow
that
i
will
pay
no
fine
outside
the
theatre
i
do
as
i
please
and
that
is
no
business
of
yours
my
dear
monsieur
perrin
so
long
as
i
do
nothing
to
interfere
with
my
theatrical
work
and
besides
you
bore
me
to
death
i
will
resign
be
i
left
him
ashamed
and
anxious
the
next
day
i
sent
in
my
written
resignation
to
perrin
and
a
few
hours
afterwards
i
was
sent
for
by
turquet
minister
of
fine
arts
i
refused
to
go
and
they
sent
a
mutual
friend
who
stated
that
perrin
had
gone
a
step
farther
than
he
had
any
right
to
that
the
fine
was
annulled
and
that
i
must
cancel
my
resignation
so
i
did
but
the
situation
was
strained
my
fame
had
become
annoying
for
my
enemies
and
a
little
trying
i
confess
for
my
friends
but
at
that
time
all
this
stir
and
noise
amused
me
vastly
i
did
nothing
to
attract
attention
my
somewhat
fantastic
tastes
my
paleness
and
thinness
my
peculiar
way
of
dressing
my
scorn
of
fashion
my
general
freedom
in
all
respects
made
me
a
being
quite
apart
from
all
others
i
did
not
recognise
the
fact
i
did
not
read
i
never
read
the
newspapers
so
i
did
not
know
what
was
said
about
me
either
favourable
or
unfavourable
surrounded
by
a
court
of
adorers
of
both
sexes
i
lived
in
a
sunny
dream
all
the
royal
personages
and
the
notabilities
who
were
the
guests
of
france
during
the
exhibition
of
came
to
see
me
this
was
a
constant
source
of
pleasure
to
me
the
comédie
was
the
first
theatre
to
which
all
these
illustrious
visitors
went
and
croizette
and
i
played
nearly
every
evening
while
i
was
playing
amphytrion
i
fell
seriously
ill
and
was
sent
to
the
south
i
remained
there
two
months
i
lived
at
mentone
but
i
made
cap
martin
my
headquarters
i
had
a
tent
put
up
here
on
the
spot
that
the
empress
eugénie
afterwards
selected
for
her
villa
i
did
not
want
to
see
anybody
and
i
thought
that
by
living
in
a
tent
so
far
from
the
town
i
should
not
be
troubled
with
visitors
this
was
a
mistake
one
day
when
i
was
having
lunch
with
my
little
boy
i
heard
the
bells
of
two
horses
and
a
carriage
the
road
overhung
my
tent
which
was
half
hidden
by
the
bushes
suddenly
a
voice
which
i
knew
but
could
not
recognise
cried
in
the
emphatic
tone
of
a
herald
sarah
bernhardt
sociétaire
of
the
comédie
française
reside
here
we
did
not
move
the
question
was
asked
again
again
the
answer
was
silence
but
we
heard
the
sound
of
breaking
branches
the
bushes
were
pushed
apart
and
at
two
yards
from
the
tent
the
unwelcome
voice
recommenced
we
were
discovered
somewhat
annoyed
i
came
out
i
saw
before
me
a
man
with
a
large
cloak
on
a
strapped
on
his
shoulders
a
grey
bowler
hat
and
a
red
happy
face
with
a
little
pointed
beard
i
looked
at
this
individual
with
anything
but
favour
he
lifted
his
hat
sarah
bernhardt
is
here
do
you
want
with
me
sir
is
my
card
i
read
nice
villa
des
i
looked
at
him
with
astonishment
and
he
was
still
more
astonished
to
see
that
his
name
did
not
produce
any
impression
on
me
he
had
a
foreign
accent
you
see
madame
i
came
to
ask
you
to
sell
me
your
group
the
i
began
to
laugh
foi
monsieur
i
am
treating
for
that
with
the
firm
of
susse
and
they
offer
me
francs
if
you
will
give
ten
you
may
have
right
he
said
are
francs
have
you
pen
and
ink
said
he
me
and
he
produced
a
little
case
in
which
there
were
pen
and
ink
i
made
out
the
receipt
and
gave
him
an
order
to
take
the
group
from
my
studio
in
paris
he
went
away
and
i
heard
the
bells
of
the
horses
ringing
and
then
dying
away
in
the
distance
after
this
i
was
often
invited
to
the
house
of
this
original
person
xxvi
the
comédie
française
goes
to
london
shortly
after
i
came
back
to
paris
at
the
theatre
they
were
preparing
for
a
benefit
performance
for
bressant
who
was
about
to
retire
from
the
stage
it
was
agreed
that
and
i
should
play
an
act
from
othello
by
jean
aicard
the
theatre
was
well
filled
and
the
audience
in
a
good
humour
after
the
song
i
was
in
bed
as
desdemona
when
suddenly
i
heard
the
public
laugh
softly
at
first
and
then
irrepressibly
othello
had
just
come
in
in
the
darkness
in
his
shirt
or
very
little
more
with
a
lantern
in
his
hand
and
gone
to
a
door
hidden
in
some
drapery
the
public
that
impersonal
unity
has
no
hesitation
in
taking
part
in
these
unseemly
manifestations
but
each
member
of
the
audience
taken
as
a
separate
individual
would
be
ashamed
to
admit
that
he
participated
in
them
but
the
ridicule
thrown
on
this
act
by
the
exaggerated
pantomime
of
the
actor
prevented
the
play
being
staged
again
and
it
was
only
twenty
years
later
that
as
an
entire
play
was
produced
at
the
théâtre
français
i
was
then
no
longer
there
after
having
played
bérénice
in
successfully
i
reappeared
in
my
of
the
queen
in
the
play
was
as
successful
at
the
théâtre
français
as
it
had
been
at
the
odéon
and
the
public
was
if
anything
still
more
favourable
to
me
played
ruy
blas
he
was
admirable
in
the
part
and
infinitely
superior
to
lafontaine
who
had
played
it
at
the
odéon
frédéric
febvre
very
well
costumed
rendered
his
part
in
a
most
interesting
manner
but
he
was
not
so
good
as
geffroy
who
was
the
most
distinguished
and
the
most
terrifying
don
salluste
that
could
be
imagined
my
relations
with
perrin
were
more
and
more
strained
he
was
pleased
that
i
was
successful
for
the
sake
of
the
theatre
he
was
happy
at
the
magnificent
receipts
of
but
he
would
have
much
preferred
that
it
had
been
another
than
i
who
received
all
the
applause
my
independence
my
horror
of
submission
even
in
appearance
annoyed
him
vastly
one
day
my
servant
came
to
tell
me
that
an
elderly
englishman
was
asking
to
see
me
so
insistently
that
he
thought
it
better
to
come
and
tell
me
though
i
had
given
orders
i
was
not
to
be
disturbed
him
away
and
let
me
work
in
i
was
just
commencing
a
picture
which
interested
me
very
much
it
represented
a
little
girl
on
palm
sunday
carrying
branches
of
palm
the
little
model
who
posed
for
me
was
a
lovely
italian
of
eight
years
old
suddenly
she
said
to
me
quarrelling
that
englishman
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
the
there
was
a
noise
of
voices
rising
higher
and
higher
irritated
i
rushed
out
my
palette
in
my
hand
resolved
to
make
the
intruder
flee
but
just
as
i
opened
the
door
of
my
studio
a
tall
man
came
so
close
to
me
that
i
drew
back
and
he
came
into
the
large
room
his
eyes
were
clear
and
piercing
his
hair
silvery
white
and
his
beard
carefully
trimmed
he
made
his
excuses
very
politely
admired
my
paintings
my
sculpture
my
and
this
while
i
was
in
complete
ignorance
of
his
name
when
at
the
end
of
ten
minutes
i
begged
him
to
sit
down
and
tell
me
to
what
i
owed
the
pleasure
of
his
visit
he
replied
in
a
stilted
voice
with
a
strong
accent
am
jarrett
the
i
can
make
your
fortune
will
you
come
to
america
i
exclaimed
firmly
well
get
angry
here
is
my
address
lose
then
at
the
moment
he
took
leave
he
said
you
are
going
to
london
with
the
comédie
française
would
you
like
to
earn
a
lot
of
money
in
london
how
playing
in
i
can
make
a
small
fortune
for
i
would
be
pleased
that
is
if
i
go
to
london
for
i
have
not
yet
will
you
sign
a
little
contract
to
which
we
will
add
an
additional
clause
and
i
signed
a
contract
with
this
man
who
inspired
me
with
confidence
at
first
sight
a
confidence
which
he
never
betrayed
the
committee
and
perrin
had
made
an
agreement
with
john
hollingshead
director
of
the
gaiety
theatre
in
london
nobody
had
been
consulted
and
i
thought
that
was
a
little
too
free
and
easy
so
when
they
told
me
about
this
agreement
i
said
nothing
perrin
rather
anxiously
took
me
aside
are
you
turning
over
in
your
mind
am
turning
over
this
that
i
will
not
go
to
london
in
a
situation
inferior
to
anybody
for
the
entire
term
of
my
contract
i
intend
to
be
a
sociétaire
with
one
entire
share
in
the
this
intention
irritated
the
committee
considerably
and
the
next
day
perrin
told
me
that
my
proposal
was
rejected
i
shall
not
go
to
london
that
is
all
nothing
in
my
contract
compels
me
to
the
committee
met
again
and
got
cried
out
let
her
stay
away
she
is
a
regular
nuisance
it
was
therefore
decided
that
i
should
not
go
to
london
but
hollingshead
and
mayer
his
partner
did
not
see
things
in
this
light
and
they
declared
that
the
contract
would
not
be
binding
if
either
croizette
or
i
did
not
go
the
agents
who
had
bought
two
hundred
thousand
worth
of
tickets
beforehand
also
refused
to
regard
the
affair
as
binding
on
them
if
we
did
not
go
mayer
came
to
see
me
in
profound
despair
and
told
me
all
about
it
shall
have
to
break
our
contract
with
the
comédie
if
you
come
he
said
the
business
can
not
go
frightened
at
the
consequences
of
my
bad
temper
i
ran
to
see
perrin
and
told
him
that
after
the
consultation
i
had
just
had
with
mayer
i
understood
the
involuntary
injury
i
should
be
causing
to
the
théâtre
français
and
to
my
comrades
and
i
told
him
i
was
ready
to
go
under
any
conditions
the
committee
was
holding
a
meeting
perrin
asked
me
to
wait
and
shortly
after
he
came
back
to
me
croizette
and
i
had
been
appointed
sociétaires
with
one
entire
share
in
the
profits
each
not
only
for
london
but
for
always
everybody
had
done
their
duty
perrin
very
much
touched
took
both
my
hands
and
drew
me
to
him
the
good
and
untamable
little
creature
we
embraced
and
peace
was
again
concluded
between
us
but
it
could
not
last
long
for
five
days
after
this
reconciliation
about
nine
in
the
evening
perrin
was
announced
at
my
house
i
had
some
friends
to
dinner
so
i
went
to
receive
him
in
the
hall
he
held
out
to
me
a
paper
that
said
he
and
i
read
in
an
english
newspaper
the
this
paragraph
comedies
of
mlle
sarah
bernhardt
under
the
management
of
sir
julius
of
mlle
sarah
bernhardt
is
composed
of
comedies
proverbs
plays
and
monologues
written
specially
for
her
and
one
or
two
artistes
of
the
comédie
française
these
comedies
are
played
without
accessories
or
scenery
and
can
be
adapted
both
in
london
and
paris
to
the
and
of
the
best
society
for
all
details
and
conditions
please
communicate
with
jarrett
secretary
of
mlle
sarah
bernhardt
at
her
as
i
was
reading
the
last
lines
it
dawned
on
me
that
jarrett
learning
that
i
was
certainly
coming
to
london
had
begun
to
advertise
me
i
explained
this
frankly
to
perrin
objection
is
there
i
said
my
making
use
of
my
evenings
to
earn
money
this
business
has
been
proposed
to
am
not
complaining
the
is
too
bad
i
cried
and
calling
for
my
secretary
i
said
me
letter
that
i
gave
you
he
brought
it
out
of
one
of
his
numerous
pockets
and
gave
it
to
perrin
to
read
you
care
to
come
and
play
nuit
at
lady
on
thursday
june
we
are
offered
francs
for
us
two
kind
me
have
this
letter
said
the
manager
visibly
annoyed
i
will
not
but
you
may
tell
delaunay
that
i
spoke
to
you
about
his
for
the
next
two
or
three
days
nothing
was
talked
of
in
paris
but
the
scandalous
notice
in
the
the
french
were
then
almost
entirely
ignorant
of
the
habits
and
customs
of
the
english
at
last
all
this
talk
annoyed
me
and
i
begged
perrin
to
try
and
stop
it
and
the
next
day
the
following
appeared
in
the
may
ado
about
nothing
in
friendly
discussion
it
has
been
decided
that
outside
the
rehearsals
and
the
performances
of
the
comédie
française
each
artiste
is
free
to
employ
his
time
as
he
sees
fit
there
is
therefore
absolutely
no
truth
at
all
in
the
pretended
quarrel
between
the
comédie
française
and
mlle
sarah
bernhardt
this
artiste
has
only
acted
strictly
within
her
rights
which
nobody
attempts
to
limit
and
all
our
artistes
intend
to
benefit
in
the
same
manner
the
manager
of
the
comédie
française
asks
only
that
the
artistes
who
form
this
company
do
not
give
performances
in
a
this
article
came
from
the
comédie
and
the
members
of
the
committee
had
taken
advantage
of
it
to
advertise
themselves
a
little
announcing
that
they
also
were
ready
to
play
in
for
the
article
was
sent
to
mayer
with
a
request
that
it
should
appear
in
the
english
papers
it
was
mayer
himself
who
told
me
this
all
disputes
being
at
an
end
we
commenced
our
preparations
for
departure
i
had
been
but
once
on
the
sea
when
it
was
decided
that
the
artistes
of
the
comédie
française
should
go
to
london
the
determined
ignorance
of
the
french
with
regard
to
all
things
foreign
was
much
more
pronounced
in
those
days
than
it
is
at
present
therefore
i
had
a
very
warm
cloak
made
as
i
had
been
assured
that
the
crossing
was
icy
cold
even
in
the
very
middle
of
summer
and
i
believed
this
on
every
side
i
was
besieged
with
lozenges
for
sedatives
for
headache
tissue
paper
to
put
down
my
back
little
compress
plasters
to
put
on
my
diaphragm
and
waterproof
cork
soles
for
my
shoes
for
it
appeared
that
above
all
things
i
must
not
have
cold
feet
oh
how
droll
and
amusing
it
all
was
i
took
everything
paid
attention
to
all
the
recommendations
and
believed
everything
i
was
told
the
most
inconceivable
thing
of
all
though
was
the
arrival
five
minutes
before
the
boat
started
of
an
enormous
wooden
case
it
was
very
light
and
was
held
by
a
tall
young
man
who
is
a
most
remarkable
individual
possessing
all
orders
and
honours
a
colossal
fortune
and
the
most
outrageous
vanity
at
that
time
he
was
a
timid
inventor
young
poor
and
sad
he
was
always
buried
in
books
which
treated
of
abstract
questions
whilst
of
life
he
knew
absolutely
nothing
he
had
a
great
admiration
for
me
mingled
with
a
trifle
of
awe
my
little
court
had
surnamed
him
he
was
long
vacillating
colourless
and
really
did
resemble
the
thin
roll
of
forcemeat
in
a
he
came
up
to
see
me
his
face
more
even
than
usual
the
boat
was
moving
a
little
my
departure
terrified
him
and
the
wind
caused
him
to
plunge
from
right
to
left
he
made
a
mysterious
sign
to
me
and
i
followed
him
accompanied
by
petit
and
leaving
my
friends
who
were
inclined
to
be
ironical
behind
when
i
was
seated
he
opened
the
case
and
took
out
an
enormous
invented
by
himself
i
was
perfectly
astounded
for
i
was
new
to
sea
voyages
and
the
idea
had
never
even
occurred
to
me
that
we
might
be
shipwrecked
during
one
crossing
la
quenelle
was
by
no
means
disconcerted
and
he
put
the
belt
on
himself
in
order
to
show
me
how
it
was
used
nothing
could
have
looked
more
foolish
than
this
man
with
his
sad
serious
face
putting
on
this
apparatus
there
were
a
dozen
bladders
round
the
belt
eleven
of
which
were
filled
with
air
and
contained
a
piece
of
sugar
in
the
twelfth
a
very
small
bladder
were
ten
drops
of
brandy
in
the
middle
of
the
belt
was
a
tiny
cushion
with
a
few
pins
on
it
understand
he
said
to
me
fall
in
the
water
paff
you
stay
like
hereupon
he
pretended
to
sit
down
rising
and
sinking
with
the
movement
of
the
waves
his
two
hands
in
front
of
him
laid
upon
the
imaginary
sea
and
his
neck
stretched
like
that
of
a
tortoise
in
order
to
keep
his
head
above
water
see
you
have
now
been
in
the
water
for
two
hours
he
explained
you
want
to
get
back
your
strength
you
take
a
pin
and
prick
an
egg
like
this
you
take
your
lump
of
sugar
and
eat
it
that
is
as
good
as
a
quarter
of
a
pound
of
he
then
threw
the
broken
bladder
overboard
and
from
the
packing
case
brought
out
another
which
he
fastened
to
the
he
had
evidently
thought
of
everything
i
was
petrified
with
amazement
a
few
of
my
friends
had
gathered
round
hoping
for
one
of
la
mad
freaks
but
they
had
never
expected
anything
like
this
one
mayer
one
of
our
fearing
a
scandal
of
too
absurd
a
kind
dispersed
the
people
who
were
gathering
round
us
i
did
not
know
whether
to
be
angry
or
to
laugh
but
the
jeering
unjust
speech
of
one
of
my
friends
roused
my
pity
for
this
poor
quenelle
i
thought
of
the
hours
he
had
spent
in
planning
combining
and
then
manufacturing
his
ridiculous
machine
i
was
touched
by
the
anxiety
and
affection
which
had
prompted
the
invention
of
this
apparatus
and
i
held
out
my
hand
to
my
poor
quenelle
saying
off
now
quickly
the
boat
is
just
going
to
he
kissed
the
hand
held
out
to
him
in
a
friendly
way
and
hurried
off
i
then
called
my
steward
claude
and
i
said
soon
as
we
are
out
of
sight
of
land
throw
that
case
and
all
it
contains
into
the
the
departure
of
the
boat
was
accompanied
by
shouts
of
au
revoir
success
good
luck
there
was
a
waving
of
hands
handkerchiefs
floating
in
the
air
and
kisses
thrown
haphazard
to
every
one
but
what
was
really
fine
and
a
sight
i
shall
never
forget
was
our
landing
at
folkestone
there
were
thousands
of
people
there
and
it
was
the
first
time
i
had
ever
heard
the
cry
of
sarah
bernhardt
i
turned
my
head
and
saw
before
me
a
pale
young
man
the
ideal
face
of
hamlet
he
presented
me
with
a
gardenia
i
was
destined
to
admire
him
later
on
as
hamlet
played
by
forbes
robertson
we
passed
on
through
a
crowd
offering
us
flowers
and
shaking
hands
and
i
soon
saw
that
i
was
more
favoured
than
the
others
this
slightly
embarrassed
me
but
i
was
delighted
all
the
same
one
of
my
comrades
who
was
just
near
and
with
whom
i
was
not
a
favourite
said
to
me
in
a
spiteful
tone
make
you
a
carpet
of
flowers
is
one
exclaimed
a
young
man
throwing
an
armful
of
lilies
on
the
ground
in
front
of
me
i
stopped
short
rather
confused
not
daring
to
walk
on
these
white
flowers
but
the
crowd
pressing
on
behind
compelled
me
to
advance
and
the
poor
lilies
had
to
be
trodden
under
foot
hip
hurrah
a
cheer
for
sarah
bernhardt
shouted
the
turbulent
young
man
his
head
was
above
all
the
other
heads
he
had
luminous
eyes
and
long
hair
and
looked
like
a
german
student
he
was
an
english
poet
though
and
one
of
the
greatest
of
the
century
a
poet
who
was
a
genius
but
who
was
alas
later
tortured
and
finally
vanquished
by
madness
it
was
oscar
wilde
the
crowd
responded
to
his
appeal
and
we
reached
our
train
amidst
shouts
of
hip
hurrah
for
sarah
bernhardt
hip
hip
hurrah
for
the
french
actors
when
the
train
arrived
at
charing
cross
towards
nine
we
were
nearly
an
hour
late
a
feeling
of
sadness
came
over
me
the
weather
was
gloomy
and
then
too
i
thought
we
should
have
been
greeted
again
on
our
arrival
in
london
with
more
hurrahs
there
were
plenty
of
people
crowds
of
people
but
none
appeared
to
know
us
on
reaching
the
station
i
had
noticed
that
there
was
a
handsome
carpet
laid
down
and
i
thought
it
was
for
us
oh
i
was
prepared
for
anything
as
our
reception
at
folkestone
had
turned
my
head
the
carpet
however
had
been
laid
down
for
their
royal
highnesses
the
prince
and
the
princess
of
wales
who
had
just
left
for
paris
this
news
disappointed
me
and
even
annoyed
me
personally
i
had
been
told
that
all
london
was
quivering
with
excitement
at
the
very
idea
of
the
visit
of
the
comédie
française
and
i
had
found
london
extremely
indifferent
the
crowd
was
large
and
even
dense
but
cold
have
the
prince
and
princess
gone
away
i
asked
mayer
because
they
had
decided
beforehand
about
this
visit
to
paris
he
replied
then
they
be
here
for
our
first
night
i
continued
the
prince
has
taken
a
box
for
the
season
for
which
he
has
paid
four
hundred
pounds
but
it
will
be
used
by
the
duke
of
i
was
in
despair
i
know
why
but
i
certainly
was
in
despair
as
i
felt
that
everything
was
going
wrong
a
footman
led
the
way
to
my
carriage
and
i
drove
through
london
with
a
heavy
heart
everything
looked
dark
and
dismal
and
when
i
reached
the
house
chester
square
i
did
not
want
to
get
out
of
my
carriage
the
door
of
the
house
was
wide
open
though
and
in
the
brilliantly
lighted
hall
i
could
see
what
looked
like
all
the
flowers
on
earth
arranged
in
baskets
bouquets
and
huge
bunches
i
got
out
of
the
carriage
and
entered
the
house
in
which
i
was
to
live
for
the
next
six
weeks
all
the
branches
seemed
to
be
stretching
out
their
flowers
to
me
you
the
cards
that
came
with
all
these
flowers
i
asked
my
he
replied
have
put
them
together
on
a
tray
all
of
them
are
from
paris
from
friends
there
this
one
is
the
only
bouquet
from
he
handed
me
an
enormous
one
and
on
the
card
with
it
i
read
the
words
henry
i
went
all
through
the
house
and
it
seemed
to
me
very
i
visited
the
garden
but
the
damp
seemed
to
go
through
me
and
my
teeth
chattered
when
i
came
in
again
that
night
when
i
went
to
sleep
my
heart
was
heavy
with
foreboding
as
though
i
were
on
the
eve
of
some
misfortune
the
following
day
was
given
up
to
receiving
journalists
i
wanted
to
see
them
all
at
the
same
time
but
jarrett
objected
to
this
that
man
was
a
veritable
advertising
genius
i
had
no
idea
of
it
at
that
time
he
had
made
me
some
very
good
offers
for
america
and
although
i
had
refused
them
i
nevertheless
held
a
very
high
opinion
of
him
on
account
of
his
intelligence
his
comic
humour
and
my
need
of
being
piloted
in
this
new
country
he
said
you
receive
them
all
together
they
will
all
be
furious
and
you
will
get
some
wretched
articles
you
must
receive
them
one
after
the
journalists
came
that
day
and
jarrett
insisted
on
my
seeing
every
one
of
them
he
stayed
in
the
room
and
saved
the
situation
when
i
said
anything
foolish
i
spoke
english
very
badly
and
some
of
the
men
spoke
french
very
badly
jarrett
translated
my
answers
to
them
i
remember
perfectly
well
that
all
of
them
began
with
mademoiselle
what
do
you
think
of
london
i
had
arrived
the
previous
evening
at
nine
and
the
first
of
these
journalists
asked
me
this
question
at
ten
in
the
morning
i
had
drawn
my
curtain
on
getting
up
and
all
i
knew
of
london
was
chester
square
a
small
square
of
sombre
verdure
in
the
midst
of
which
was
a
black
statue
and
the
horizon
bounded
by
an
ugly
church
i
really
could
not
answer
the
question
but
jarrett
was
quite
prepared
for
this
and
i
learnt
the
following
morning
that
i
was
most
enthusiastic
about
the
beauty
of
london
that
i
had
already
seen
a
number
of
the
public
buildings
towards
five
hortense
damain
arrived
she
was
a
charming
woman
and
a
favourite
in
london
society
she
had
come
to
inform
me
that
the
duchess
of
and
lady
would
call
on
me
at
five
stay
with
me
then
i
said
to
her
know
how
unsociable
i
am
i
feel
sure
that
i
shall
be
at
the
time
fixed
my
visitors
were
announced
this
was
the
first
time
i
had
come
into
contact
with
any
members
of
the
english
aristocracy
and
i
have
always
had
since
a
very
pleasant
memory
of
it
lady
r
was
extremely
beautiful
and
the
duchess
was
so
gracious
so
distinguished
and
so
kind
that
i
was
very
much
touched
by
her
visit
a
few
minutes
later
lord
dudley
called
i
knew
him
very
well
as
he
had
been
introduced
to
me
by
marshal
canrobert
one
of
my
dearest
friends
he
asked
me
if
i
would
care
to
have
a
ride
the
following
morning
and
he
said
he
had
a
very
nice
horse
which
was
entirely
at
my
service
i
thanked
him
but
i
wanted
first
to
drive
in
rotten
row
at
seven
hortense
damain
came
to
fetch
me
to
dine
with
her
at
the
house
of
the
baroness
m
she
had
a
very
nice
house
in
gate
there
were
about
twenty
guests
among
others
the
painter
millais
i
had
been
told
that
the
was
very
bad
in
england
but
i
thought
this
dinner
perfect
i
had
been
told
that
the
english
were
cold
and
sedate
i
found
them
charming
and
full
of
humour
every
one
spoke
french
very
well
and
i
was
ashamed
of
my
ignorance
of
the
english
language
after
dinner
there
were
recitations
and
music
i
was
touched
by
the
gracefulness
and
tact
of
my
hosts
in
not
asking
me
to
recite
any
poetry
i
was
very
much
interested
in
observing
the
society
in
which
i
found
myself
it
did
not
in
any
way
resemble
a
french
gathering
the
young
girls
seemed
to
be
enjoying
themselves
on
their
own
account
and
enjoying
themselves
thoroughly
they
had
not
come
there
to
find
a
husband
what
surprised
me
a
little
was
the
of
ladies
who
were
getting
on
in
years
and
to
whom
time
had
not
been
very
merciful
i
spoke
of
this
to
hortense
damain
frightful
i
said
but
she
was
very
charming
my
friend
hortense
but
she
troubled
about
nothing
that
was
not
she
sent
me
the
a
few
days
before
i
left
paris
square
tu
in
chester
square
thou
shalt
live
row
tu
in
rotten
row
thou
shalt
ride
parlement
parliament
thou
shalt
visit
garden
parties
thou
shalt
frequent
visite
tu
every
visit
thou
shalt
return
chaque
lettre
tu
every
letter
thou
shalt
answer
tu
photographs
thou
shalt
sign
damain
tu
to
hortense
damain
thou
shalt
listen
tous
ses
conseils
les
and
all
her
counsels
thou
shalt
follow
i
laughed
at
these
but
i
soon
realised
that
under
this
jocular
form
she
considered
them
as
very
serious
and
important
alas
my
poor
friend
had
hit
upon
the
wrong
person
for
her
counsels
i
detested
paying
visits
writing
letters
signing
photographs
or
following
any
advice
i
adore
having
people
come
to
see
me
and
i
detest
going
to
see
them
i
adore
receiving
letters
reading
them
commenting
on
them
but
i
detest
writing
them
i
detest
riding
and
driving
in
frequented
parts
and
i
adore
lonely
roads
and
solitary
places
i
adore
giving
advice
and
i
detest
receiving
it
and
i
never
follow
at
once
any
wise
advice
that
is
given
me
it
always
requires
an
effort
of
my
will
to
recognise
the
justice
of
any
counsel
and
then
an
effort
of
my
intellect
to
be
grateful
for
it
at
first
it
simply
annoys
me
consequently
i
paid
no
attention
to
hortense
counsels
nor
yet
to
and
in
this
i
made
a
great
mistake
for
many
people
were
vexed
with
me
in
any
other
country
i
should
have
made
enemies
on
that
first
visit
to
london
what
a
quantity
of
letters
of
invitation
i
received
to
which
i
never
replied
how
many
charming
women
called
upon
me
and
i
never
returned
their
calls
then
too
how
many
times
accepted
invitations
to
dinner
and
never
went
after
all
nor
did
i
even
send
a
line
of
excuse
it
is
perfectly
odious
i
know
and
yet
i
always
accept
with
pleasure
and
intend
to
go
but
when
the
day
comes
i
am
tired
perhaps
or
want
to
have
a
quiet
time
or
to
be
free
from
any
obligation
and
when
i
am
obliged
to
decide
one
way
or
another
the
time
has
gone
by
and
it
is
too
late
to
send
word
and
too
late
to
go
and
so
i
stay
at
home
dissatisfied
with
myself
with
every
one
else
and
with
everything
xxvii
london
life
my
first
performance
at
the
gaiety
theatre
hospitality
is
a
quality
made
up
of
primitive
taste
and
antique
grandeur
the
english
are
in
my
opinion
the
most
hospitable
people
on
earth
and
they
are
hospitable
simply
and
munificently
when
an
englishman
has
opened
his
door
to
you
he
never
closes
it
again
he
excuses
your
faults
and
accepts
your
peculiarities
it
is
thanks
to
this
broadness
of
ideas
that
i
have
been
for
years
the
beloved
and
pampered
artiste
i
was
delighted
with
my
first
in
london
and
i
returned
home
very
gay
and
very
much
i
found
some
of
my
friends
there
parisians
who
had
just
arrived
and
they
were
furious
my
enthusiasm
exasperated
them
and
we
sat
up
arguing
until
two
in
the
morning
the
next
day
i
went
to
rotten
row
it
was
glorious
weather
and
all
hyde
park
seemed
to
be
strewn
with
enormous
bouquets
there
were
the
wonderfully
arranged
by
the
gardeners
then
there
were
the
clusters
of
sunshades
blue
pink
red
white
or
yellow
which
sheltered
the
light
hats
covered
with
flowers
under
which
shone
the
pretty
faces
of
children
and
women
along
the
riding
path
there
was
an
exciting
gallop
of
graceful
thoroughbreds
bearing
along
some
hundreds
of
horsewomen
slender
supple
and
courageous
then
there
were
men
and
children
the
latter
mounted
on
big
irish
ponies
there
were
other
children
too
galloping
along
on
scotch
ponies
with
long
shaggy
manes
the
hair
and
the
manes
of
the
horses
streaming
in
the
wind
of
their
own
speed
the
carriage
road
between
the
and
the
foot
passengers
was
filled
with
open
carriages
of
various
kinds
and
very
smart
cabs
there
were
powdered
footmen
horses
decorated
with
flowers
sportsmen
driving
ladies
too
driving
admirable
horses
all
this
elegance
this
essence
of
luxury
and
this
joy
of
life
brought
back
to
my
memory
the
vision
of
our
bois
de
boulogne
so
elegant
and
so
animated
a
few
years
before
when
napoleon
iii
used
to
drive
through
on
his
nonchalant
and
smiling
ah
how
beautiful
it
was
in
those
days
our
bois
de
boulogne
with
the
officers
caracoling
in
the
avenue
des
acacias
admired
by
our
beautiful
society
women
the
joy
of
life
was
everywhere
the
love
of
love
enveloping
life
with
an
infinite
charm
i
closed
my
eyes
and
i
felt
a
pang
at
my
heart
as
the
awful
recollections
of
crowded
to
my
brain
he
was
dead
our
gentle
emperor
with
his
shrewd
smile
dead
vanquished
by
the
sword
betrayed
by
fortune
crushed
with
grief
the
thread
of
life
in
paris
had
been
taken
up
again
in
all
its
intenseness
but
the
life
of
elegance
of
charm
and
of
luxury
was
still
shrouded
in
crape
scarcely
eight
years
had
passed
since
the
war
had
struck
down
our
soldiers
ruined
our
hopes
and
tarnished
our
glory
three
presidents
had
already
succeeded
each
other
that
wretched
little
thiers
with
his
perverse
soul
had
worn
his
teeth
out
with
nibbling
at
every
kind
of
government
royalty
under
louis
philippe
empire
under
napoleon
and
the
executive
power
of
the
french
republic
he
had
never
even
thought
of
lifting
our
beloved
paris
up
again
bowed
down
as
she
was
under
the
weight
of
so
many
ruins
he
had
been
succeeded
by
macmahon
a
good
brave
man
but
a
cipher
grévy
had
succeeded
the
marshal
but
he
was
miserly
and
considered
all
outlay
unnecessary
for
himself
for
other
people
and
for
the
country
and
so
paris
remained
sad
nursing
the
leprosy
that
the
commune
had
communicated
to
her
by
the
kiss
of
its
fires
and
our
delightful
bois
de
boulogne
still
bore
the
traces
of
the
injuries
that
the
national
defence
had
inflicted
on
her
the
avenue
des
acacias
was
deserted
i
opened
my
eyes
again
they
were
filled
with
tears
and
through
their
mist
i
caught
a
glimpse
once
more
of
the
triumphant
vitality
which
surrounded
me
i
wanted
to
return
home
at
once
for
i
was
acting
that
night
for
the
first
time
and
i
felt
rather
wretched
and
despairing
there
were
several
persons
awaiting
me
at
my
house
in
chester
square
but
i
did
not
want
to
see
any
one
i
took
a
cup
of
tea
and
went
to
the
gaiety
theatre
where
we
were
to
face
the
english
public
for
the
first
time
i
knew
already
that
i
had
been
elected
the
favourite
and
the
idea
of
this
chilled
me
with
terror
for
i
am
what
is
known
as
a
i
am
subject
to
the
or
stage
fright
and
i
have
it
terribly
when
i
first
appeared
on
the
stage
i
was
timid
but
i
never
had
this
i
used
to
turn
as
red
as
a
poppy
when
i
happened
to
meet
the
eye
of
some
spectator
i
was
ashamed
of
talking
so
loud
before
so
many
silent
people
that
was
the
effect
of
my
cloistered
life
but
i
had
no
feeling
of
fear
the
first
time
i
ever
had
the
real
sensation
of
or
stage
fright
was
in
the
month
of
january
at
the
seventh
or
perhaps
the
eighth
performance
of
the
success
of
this
little
masterpiece
had
been
enormous
and
my
interpretation
of
the
part
of
zanetto
had
delighted
the
public
and
particularly
the
students
when
i
went
on
the
stage
that
day
i
was
suddenly
applauded
by
the
whole
house
i
turned
towards
the
imperial
box
thinking
that
the
emperor
had
just
entered
but
no
the
box
was
empty
and
i
realised
then
that
all
the
bravos
were
for
me
i
was
seized
with
a
fit
of
nervous
trembling
and
my
eyes
smarted
with
tears
that
i
had
to
keep
back
agar
and
i
had
five
curtain
calls
and
on
leaving
the
theatre
the
students
ranged
on
each
side
gave
me
three
cheers
on
reaching
home
i
flung
myself
into
the
arms
of
my
blind
grandmother
who
was
then
living
with
me
the
matter
with
you
my
dear
she
asked
all
over
with
me
grandmother
i
said
want
to
make
a
of
me
and
i
talent
enough
for
that
see
drag
me
down
and
finish
me
off
with
all
their
my
grandmother
took
my
head
in
her
hands
and
i
met
the
vacant
look
in
her
large
light
eyes
fixed
on
me
told
me
my
child
that
you
wanted
to
be
the
first
in
your
profession
and
when
the
opportunity
comes
to
you
why
you
are
frightened
it
seems
to
me
that
you
are
a
very
bad
i
drove
back
my
tears
and
declared
that
i
would
bear
up
courageously
against
this
success
which
had
come
to
interfere
with
my
tranquillity
my
heedlessness
and
my
but
from
that
time
forth
fear
took
possession
of
me
and
stage
fright
martyrised
me
it
was
under
these
conditions
that
i
prepared
for
the
second
act
of
in
which
i
was
to
appear
for
the
first
time
before
the
english
public
three
times
over
i
put
rouge
on
my
cheeks
blackened
my
eyes
and
three
times
over
i
took
it
all
off
again
with
a
sponge
i
thought
i
looked
ugly
and
it
seemed
to
me
i
was
thinner
than
ever
and
not
so
tall
i
closed
my
eyes
to
listen
to
my
voice
my
special
pitch
is
bal
which
i
pronounce
low
down
with
the
open
or
take
high
by
dwelling
on
the
ah
but
there
was
no
doubt
about
it
my
neither
sounded
high
nor
low
my
voice
was
hoarse
in
the
low
notes
and
not
clear
in
the
soprano
i
cried
with
rage
and
just
then
i
was
informed
that
the
second
act
of
was
about
to
commence
this
drove
me
wild
i
had
not
my
veil
on
nor
my
rings
and
my
cameo
belt
was
not
fastened
i
began
to
murmur
voici
vers
mon
coeur
tout
mon
sang
se
retire
en
le
voyant
that
word
struck
me
with
a
new
idea
what
if
i
did
forget
the
words
i
had
to
say
why
yes
what
was
it
i
had
to
say
i
did
not
know
i
could
not
remember
what
was
i
to
say
after
le
no
one
answered
me
every
one
was
alarmed
at
my
nervous
state
i
heard
got
mumble
going
mad
mlle
thénard
who
was
playing
oenone
my
old
nurse
said
to
me
yourself
all
the
english
have
gone
to
paris
no
one
in
the
house
but
this
foolishly
comic
speech
turned
my
thoughts
in
another
direction
stupid
you
are
i
said
know
how
frightened
i
was
at
brussels
all
for
nothing
she
answered
calmly
were
only
english
people
in
the
theatre
that
i
had
to
go
on
the
stage
at
once
and
i
could
not
even
answer
her
but
she
had
changed
the
current
of
my
ideas
i
still
had
stage
fright
but
not
the
fright
that
paralyses
only
the
kind
that
drives
one
wild
this
is
bad
enough
but
it
is
preferable
to
the
other
sort
it
makes
one
do
too
much
but
at
any
rate
one
does
something
the
whole
house
had
applauded
my
arrival
on
the
stage
for
a
few
seconds
and
as
i
bent
my
head
in
acknowledgment
i
said
within
myself
yes
you
shall
see
going
to
give
you
my
very
blood
my
life
itself
my
when
i
began
my
part
as
i
had
lost
my
i
started
on
rather
too
high
a
note
and
when
once
in
full
swing
i
could
not
get
lower
again
i
simply
could
not
stop
i
suffered
i
wept
i
implored
i
cried
out
and
it
was
all
real
my
suffering
was
horrible
my
tears
were
flowing
scorching
and
bitter
i
implored
hippolyte
for
the
love
which
was
killing
me
and
my
arms
stretched
out
to
were
the
arms
of
phèdre
writhing
in
the
cruel
longing
for
his
embrace
the
inspiration
had
come
when
the
curtain
fell
lifted
me
up
inanimate
and
carried
me
to
my
the
public
unaware
of
what
was
happening
wanted
me
to
appear
again
and
bow
i
too
wanted
to
return
and
thank
the
public
for
its
attention
its
kindliness
and
its
emotion
i
returned
the
following
is
what
john
murray
said
in
the
of
june
recalled
with
loud
cries
mlle
bernhardt
appeared
exhausted
by
her
efforts
and
supported
by
she
received
an
ovation
which
i
think
is
unique
in
the
annals
of
the
theatre
in
the
following
morning
the
terminated
its
admirable
criticism
with
these
lines
mlle
sarah
bernhardt
exerted
every
nerve
and
fibre
and
her
passion
grew
with
the
excitement
of
the
spectators
for
when
after
a
recall
that
could
not
be
resisted
the
curtain
drew
up
was
seen
supporting
the
exhausted
figure
of
the
actress
who
had
won
her
triumph
only
after
tremendous
physical
exertion
and
triumph
it
was
however
short
and
the
finished
its
article
with
these
words
subdued
passion
repressed
for
a
time
until
at
length
it
burst
its
bonds
and
the
despairing
woman
is
revealed
to
hippolyte
was
shown
with
so
vivid
a
reality
that
a
scene
of
enthusiasm
such
as
is
rarely
witnessed
in
a
theatre
followed
the
fall
of
the
curtain
mlle
sarah
bernhardt
in
the
few
minutes
she
was
upon
the
stage
and
coming
on
it
must
be
remembered
to
plunge
into
the
middle
of
a
stirring
tragedy
yet
contrived
to
make
an
impression
which
will
not
soon
be
effaced
from
those
who
were
the
post
brief
are
the
words
spoken
before
phèdre
rushes
into
the
room
to
commence
tremblingly
and
nervously
with
struggles
which
rend
and
tear
and
convulse
the
system
the
secret
of
her
shameful
love
as
her
passion
mastered
what
remained
of
modesty
or
reserve
in
her
nature
the
woman
sprang
forward
and
recoiled
again
with
the
movements
of
a
panther
striving
as
it
seemed
to
tear
from
her
bosom
the
heart
which
stifled
her
with
its
unholy
longings
until
in
the
end
when
terrified
at
the
horror
her
breathings
have
provoked
in
hippolyte
she
strove
to
pull
his
sword
from
its
sheath
and
plunge
it
in
her
own
breast
she
fell
back
in
complete
and
absolute
collapse
this
exhibition
marvellous
in
beauty
of
pose
in
febrile
force
in
intensity
and
in
purity
of
delivery
is
the
more
remarkable
as
the
passion
had
to
be
reached
so
to
speak
at
a
bound
no
performance
of
the
first
act
having
roused
the
actress
to
the
requisite
heat
it
proved
mlle
sarah
bernhardt
worthy
of
her
reputation
and
shows
what
may
be
expected
from
her
by
the
public
which
has
eagerly
expected
her
this
london
first
night
was
decisive
for
my
future
xxviii
my
performances
in
london
my
exhibition
my
wild
animals
trouble
with
the
comédie
française
my
intense
desire
to
win
over
the
english
public
had
caused
me
to
overtax
my
strength
i
had
done
my
utmost
at
the
first
performance
and
had
not
spared
myself
in
the
least
the
consequence
was
in
the
night
i
vomited
blood
in
such
an
alarming
way
that
a
messenger
was
despatched
to
the
french
embassy
in
search
of
a
physician
vintras
who
was
at
the
head
of
the
french
hospital
in
london
found
me
lying
on
my
bed
exhausted
and
looking
more
dead
than
alive
he
was
afraid
that
i
should
not
recover
and
requested
that
my
family
be
sent
for
i
made
a
gesture
with
my
hand
to
the
effect
that
it
was
not
necessary
as
i
could
not
speak
i
wrote
down
with
a
pencil
for
vintras
remained
with
me
part
of
the
night
putting
crushed
ice
between
my
lips
every
five
minutes
at
length
towards
five
in
the
morning
the
blood
vomiting
ceased
and
thanks
to
a
potion
that
the
doctor
gave
me
i
fell
asleep
we
were
to
play
that
night
at
the
gaiety
and
as
my
was
not
a
very
fatiguing
one
i
wanted
to
perform
my
part
parrot
arrived
by
the
four
boat
and
refused
categorically
to
give
his
consent
he
had
attended
me
from
my
childhood
i
really
felt
much
better
and
the
feverishness
had
left
me
i
wanted
to
get
up
but
to
this
parrot
objected
presently
vintras
and
mayer
the
impresario
of
the
comédie
française
were
announced
hollingshead
the
director
of
the
gaiety
theatre
was
waiting
in
a
carriage
at
the
door
to
know
whether
i
was
going
to
play
in
the
piece
announced
on
the
bills
i
asked
parrot
to
rejoin
vintras
in
the
and
i
gave
instructions
for
mayer
to
be
introduced
into
my
room
feel
much
better
i
said
to
him
very
quickly
very
weak
still
but
i
will
play
hush
say
a
word
here
tell
hollingshead
and
wait
for
me
in
the
but
let
any
one
else
i
then
got
up
and
dressed
very
quickly
my
maid
helped
me
and
as
she
had
guessed
what
my
plan
was
she
was
highly
amused
wrapped
in
my
cloak
with
a
lace
fichu
over
my
head
i
joined
mayer
in
the
and
then
we
both
got
into
his
hansom
to
me
in
an
time
i
said
in
a
low
voice
to
my
maid
are
you
going
asked
mayer
perfectly
stupefied
the
theatre
quick
quick
i
answered
the
cab
started
and
i
then
explained
to
him
that
if
i
had
stayed
at
home
neither
parrot
nor
vintras
would
have
allowed
me
to
perform
die
is
cast
now
i
added
we
shall
see
what
when
once
i
was
at
the
theatre
i
took
refuge
in
the
private
office
in
order
to
avoid
anger
i
was
very
fond
of
him
and
i
knew
how
wrongly
i
was
acting
with
regard
to
him
considering
the
inconvenience
to
which
he
had
put
himself
in
making
the
journey
specially
for
me
in
response
to
my
summons
i
knew
though
how
impossible
it
would
have
been
to
have
made
him
understand
that
i
felt
really
better
and
that
in
risking
my
life
i
was
really
only
risking
what
was
my
own
to
dispose
of
as
i
pleased
half
an
hour
later
my
maid
joined
me
she
brought
with
her
a
letter
from
parrot
full
of
gentle
reproaches
and
furious
advice
finishing
with
a
prescription
in
case
of
a
relapse
he
was
leaving
an
hour
later
and
would
not
even
come
and
shake
hands
with
me
i
felt
quite
sure
though
that
we
should
make
it
all
up
again
on
my
return
i
then
began
to
prepare
for
my
in
while
dressing
i
fainted
three
times
but
i
was
determined
to
play
the
opium
that
i
had
taken
in
my
potion
made
my
head
rather
heavy
i
arrived
on
the
stage
in
a
state
delighted
with
the
applause
i
received
i
walked
along
as
though
i
were
in
a
dream
and
could
scarcely
distinguish
my
surroundings
the
house
itself
i
only
saw
through
a
luminous
mist
my
feet
glided
along
without
any
effort
on
the
carpet
and
my
voice
sounded
to
me
far
away
very
far
away
i
was
in
that
delicious
stupor
that
one
experiences
after
chloroform
morphine
opium
or
hasheesh
the
first
act
went
off
very
well
but
in
the
third
act
just
when
i
was
about
to
tell
the
duchesse
de
septmonts
croizette
all
the
troubles
that
i
clarkson
had
gone
through
during
my
life
just
as
i
should
have
commenced
my
interminable
story
i
could
not
remember
anything
croizette
murmured
my
first
phrase
for
me
but
i
could
only
see
her
lips
move
without
hearing
a
word
i
then
said
quite
calmly
reason
i
sent
for
you
here
madame
is
because
i
wanted
to
tell
you
my
reasons
for
acting
as
i
have
done
i
have
thought
it
over
and
have
decided
not
to
tell
you
them
sophie
croizette
gazed
at
me
with
a
terrified
look
in
her
eyes
she
then
rose
and
left
the
stage
her
lips
trembling
and
her
eyes
fixed
on
me
all
the
time
the
matter
every
one
asked
when
she
sank
almost
breathless
into
an
has
gone
mad
she
exclaimed
assure
you
she
has
gone
quite
mad
she
has
cut
out
the
whole
of
her
scene
with
how
every
one
asked
has
cut
out
two
hundred
lines
said
croizette
what
for
was
the
eager
question
know
she
looks
quite
the
whole
of
this
conversation
which
was
repeated
to
me
later
on
took
much
less
time
than
it
does
now
to
write
it
down
coquelin
had
been
told
and
he
now
came
on
to
the
stage
to
finish
the
act
the
curtain
fell
i
was
stupefied
and
desperate
afterwards
on
hearing
all
that
people
told
me
i
had
not
noticed
that
anything
was
wrong
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
had
played
the
whole
of
my
part
as
usual
but
i
was
really
under
the
influence
of
the
opium
there
was
very
little
for
me
to
say
in
the
fifth
act
and
i
went
through
that
perfectly
well
the
following
day
the
accounts
in
the
papers
sounded
the
praises
of
our
company
but
the
piece
itself
was
criticised
i
was
afraid
at
first
that
my
involuntary
omission
of
the
important
scene
in
the
third
act
was
one
of
the
causes
of
the
severity
of
the
press
this
was
not
so
though
as
all
the
critics
had
read
and
the
piece
they
discussed
the
play
itself
and
did
not
mention
my
slip
of
memory
the
which
was
in
a
very
bad
humour
with
me
just
then
had
an
article
from
which
i
quote
the
following
extract
is
not
a
piece
in
accordance
with
the
english
taste
mlle
croizette
however
was
applauded
enthusiastically
and
so
were
coquelin
and
febvre
mile
sarah
bernhardt
nervous
as
usual
lost
her
june
he
knew
perfectly
well
this
worthy
johnson
footnote
johnson
london
correspondent
of
that
i
was
very
ill
he
had
been
to
my
house
and
seen
parrot
consequently
he
was
aware
that
i
was
acting
in
spite
of
the
faculty
in
the
interests
of
the
comédie
française
the
english
public
had
given
me
such
proofs
of
appreciation
that
the
comédie
was
rather
affected
by
it
and
the
which
was
at
that
time
the
organ
of
the
théâtre
français
requested
johnson
to
modify
his
praises
of
me
this
he
did
the
whole
time
that
we
were
in
london
my
reason
for
telling
about
my
loss
of
memory
which
was
quite
an
unimportant
incident
in
itself
is
merely
to
prove
to
authors
how
unnecessary
it
is
to
take
the
trouble
of
explaining
the
characters
of
their
creations
alexandre
dumas
was
certainly
anxious
to
give
us
the
reasons
which
caused
clarkson
to
act
as
strangely
as
she
did
he
had
created
a
person
who
was
extremely
interesting
and
full
of
action
as
the
play
proceeds
she
reveals
herself
to
the
public
in
the
first
act
by
the
lines
which
clarkson
says
to
madame
de
septmonts
should
be
very
glad
madame
if
you
would
call
on
me
we
could
talk
about
one
of
your
friends
monsieur
gérard
whom
i
love
perhaps
as
much
as
you
do
although
he
does
not
perhaps
care
for
me
as
he
does
for
that
was
quite
enough
to
interest
the
public
in
these
two
women
it
was
the
eternal
struggle
of
good
and
evil
the
combat
between
vice
and
virtue
but
it
evidently
seemed
rather
commonplace
to
dumas
ancient
history
in
fact
and
he
wanted
to
rejuvenate
the
old
theme
by
trying
to
arrange
for
an
orchestra
with
organ
and
banjo
the
result
he
obtained
was
a
fearful
cacophony
he
wrote
a
foolish
piece
which
might
have
been
a
beautiful
one
the
originality
of
his
style
the
loyalty
of
his
ideas
and
the
brutality
of
his
humour
sufficed
for
rejuvenating
old
ideas
which
in
reality
are
the
eternal
basis
of
tragedies
comedies
novels
pictures
poems
and
pamphlets
it
was
love
between
vice
and
virtue
among
the
spectators
who
saw
the
first
performance
of
in
london
and
there
were
quite
as
many
french
as
english
present
not
one
remarked
that
there
was
something
wanting
and
not
one
of
them
said
that
he
had
not
understood
the
character
i
talked
about
it
to
a
very
learned
frenchman
you
notice
the
gap
in
the
third
act
i
asked
him
he
replied
my
big
scene
with
croizette
then
read
what
i
left
out
i
insisted
when
he
had
read
this
he
exclaimed
much
the
better
very
dull
all
that
story
and
quite
useless
i
understand
the
character
without
all
that
rigmarole
and
that
romantic
later
on
when
i
apologised
to
dumas
for
the
way
in
which
i
had
cut
down
his
play
he
answered
my
dear
child
when
i
write
a
play
i
think
it
is
good
when
i
see
it
played
i
think
it
is
stupid
and
when
any
one
tells
it
to
me
i
think
it
is
perfect
as
the
person
always
forgets
half
of
the
performances
given
by
the
comédie
française
drew
a
crowd
nightly
to
the
gaiety
theatre
and
i
remained
the
favourite
i
mention
this
now
with
pride
but
without
any
vanity
i
was
very
happy
and
very
grateful
for
my
success
but
my
comrades
had
a
grudge
against
me
on
account
of
it
and
hostilities
began
in
an
underhand
treacherous
way
jarrett
my
adviser
and
agent
had
assured
me
that
i
should
be
able
to
sell
a
few
of
my
works
either
my
sculpture
or
paintings
i
had
therefore
taken
with
me
six
pieces
of
sculpture
and
ten
pictures
and
i
had
an
exhibition
of
them
in
piccadilly
i
sent
out
invitations
about
a
hundred
in
all
his
royal
highness
the
prince
of
wales
let
me
know
that
he
would
come
with
the
princess
of
wales
the
english
aristocracy
and
the
celebrities
of
london
came
to
the
inauguration
i
had
only
sent
out
a
hundred
invitations
but
twelve
hundred
people
arrived
and
were
introduced
to
me
i
was
delighted
and
enjoyed
it
all
immensely
gladstone
did
me
the
great
honour
of
talking
to
me
for
about
ten
minutes
with
his
genial
mind
he
spoke
of
everything
in
a
singularly
gracious
way
he
asked
me
what
impression
the
attacks
of
certain
clergymen
on
the
comédie
française
and
the
damnable
profession
of
dramatic
artistes
had
made
on
me
i
answered
that
i
considered
our
art
quite
as
profitable
morally
as
the
sermons
of
catholic
and
protestant
preachers
will
you
tell
me
mademoiselle
he
insisted
moral
lesson
you
can
draw
from
gladstone
i
replied
surprise
me
is
an
ancient
tragedy
the
morality
and
customs
of
those
times
belong
to
perspective
quite
different
from
ours
and
different
from
the
morality
of
our
present
society
and
yet
in
that
there
is
the
punishment
of
the
old
nurse
oenone
who
commits
the
atrocious
crime
of
accusing
an
innocent
person
the
love
of
phèdre
is
excusable
on
account
of
the
fatality
which
hangs
over
her
family
and
descends
pitilessly
upon
her
in
our
times
we
should
call
that
fatality
atavism
for
phèdre
was
the
daughter
of
minos
and
pasiphaë
as
to
theseus
his
verdict
against
which
there
could
be
no
appeal
was
an
arbitrary
and
monstrous
act
and
was
punished
by
the
death
of
that
beloved
son
of
his
who
was
the
sole
and
last
hope
of
his
life
we
ought
never
to
do
what
is
said
the
grand
old
man
are
against
capital
punishment
quite
right
frederic
leighton
then
joined
us
and
with
great
kindness
complimented
me
on
one
of
my
pictures
representing
a
young
girl
holding
some
palms
this
picture
was
bought
by
prince
leopold
my
little
exhibition
was
a
great
success
but
i
never
thought
that
it
was
to
be
the
cause
of
so
much
gossip
and
of
so
many
cowardly
until
finally
it
led
to
my
rupture
with
the
comédie
française
i
had
no
pretensions
either
as
a
painter
or
a
sculptress
and
i
exhibited
my
works
for
the
sake
of
selling
them
as
i
wanted
to
buy
two
little
lions
and
had
not
money
enough
i
sold
the
pictures
for
what
they
were
worth
that
is
to
say
at
very
modest
prices
lady
h
bought
my
group
the
it
was
smaller
than
the
large
group
i
had
exhibited
two
years
previously
at
the
paris
salon
and
for
which
i
had
received
a
prize
the
smaller
group
was
in
marble
and
i
had
worked
at
it
with
the
greatest
care
i
wanted
to
sell
it
for
but
lady
h
sent
me
together
with
a
charming
note
which
i
venture
to
quote
it
ran
as
follows
me
the
favour
madame
of
accepting
the
enclosed
for
your
admirable
group
the
will
you
also
do
me
the
honour
of
coming
to
lunch
with
me
and
afterwards
you
shall
choose
for
yourself
the
place
where
your
piece
of
sculpture
will
have
the
best
ethel
this
was
tuesday
and
i
was
playing
in
zaïre
that
evening
but
wednesday
thursday
and
friday
i
was
not
acting
i
had
money
enough
now
to
buy
my
lions
so
without
saying
a
word
at
the
theatre
i
started
for
liverpool
i
knew
there
was
a
big
menagerie
there
zoo
and
that
i
should
find
some
lions
for
sale
the
journey
was
most
amusing
as
although
i
was
travelling
incognito
i
was
recognised
all
along
the
route
and
was
made
a
great
deal
of
three
gentlemen
friends
and
hortense
damain
were
with
me
and
it
was
a
very
lively
little
trip
i
knew
that
i
was
not
shirking
my
duties
at
the
comédie
as
i
was
not
to
play
again
before
saturday
and
this
was
only
wednesday
we
started
in
the
morning
at
and
arrived
at
liverpool
about
we
went
at
once
to
but
could
not
find
the
entrance
to
the
house
we
asked
a
shopkeeper
at
the
corner
of
the
street
and
he
pointed
to
a
little
door
which
we
had
already
opened
and
closed
twice
as
we
could
not
believe
that
was
the
entrance
i
had
seen
a
large
iron
gateway
with
a
wide
courtyard
beyond
and
we
were
in
front
of
a
little
door
leading
into
quite
a
small
room
where
we
found
a
little
man
cross
we
said
my
name
he
replied
want
to
buy
some
lions
i
then
said
he
began
to
laugh
and
then
he
asked
you
really
mademoiselle
are
you
so
fond
of
animals
i
went
to
london
last
week
to
see
the
comédie
française
and
i
saw
you
in
from
that
you
discovered
that
i
like
animals
i
said
to
him
it
was
a
man
who
sells
dogs
in
street
who
told
me
he
said
you
had
bought
two
dogs
from
him
and
that
if
it
had
not
been
for
a
gentleman
who
was
with
you
you
would
have
bought
he
told
me
all
this
in
very
bad
french
but
with
a
great
deal
of
humour
cross
i
said
want
two
lions
show
you
what
i
have
he
replied
leading
the
way
into
the
courtyard
where
the
wild
beasts
were
oh
what
magnificent
creatures
they
were
there
were
two
superb
african
lions
with
shining
coats
and
tails
which
were
beating
the
air
they
had
only
just
arrived
and
they
were
in
perfect
health
with
plenty
of
courage
for
rebellion
they
knew
nothing
of
the
resignation
which
is
the
dominating
stigma
of
civilised
beings
cross
i
said
are
too
big
i
want
some
young
lions
any
then
show
me
all
your
i
saw
the
tigers
the
leopards
the
jackals
the
cheetahs
the
pumas
and
i
stopped
in
front
of
the
elephants
i
simply
adore
them
and
i
should
have
liked
to
have
a
dwarf
elephant
that
has
always
been
one
of
my
dreams
and
perhaps
some
day
i
shall
be
able
to
realise
it
cross
had
not
any
though
so
i
bought
a
cheetah
it
was
quite
young
and
very
droll
it
looked
like
a
gargoyle
on
some
castle
of
the
middle
ages
i
also
bought
a
all
white
with
a
thick
coat
fiery
eyes
and
teeth
he
was
terrifying
to
look
at
cross
made
me
a
present
of
six
chameleons
which
belonged
to
a
small
breed
and
looked
like
lizards
he
also
gave
me
an
admirable
chameleon
a
prehistoric
fabulous
sort
of
animal
it
was
a
veritable
chinese
curiosity
and
changed
colour
from
pale
green
to
dark
bronze
at
one
minute
slender
and
long
like
a
lily
leaf
and
then
all
at
once
puffed
out
and
like
a
toad
its
lorgnette
eyes
like
those
of
a
lobster
were
quite
independent
of
each
other
with
its
right
eye
it
would
look
ahead
and
with
its
left
eye
it
looked
backwards
i
was
delighted
and
quite
enthusiastic
over
this
present
i
named
my
chameleon
in
honour
of
cross
we
returned
to
london
with
the
cheetah
in
a
cage
the
in
a
leash
my
six
little
chameleons
in
a
box
and
on
my
shoulder
fastened
to
a
gold
chain
we
had
bought
at
a
i
had
not
found
any
lions
but
i
was
delighted
all
the
same
my
servants
were
not
as
pleased
as
i
was
there
were
already
three
dogs
in
the
house
minniccio
who
had
accompanied
me
from
paris
bull
and
fly
bought
in
london
then
there
was
my
parrot
bizibouzou
and
my
monkey
darwin
madame
guérard
screamed
when
she
saw
these
new
guests
arrive
my
steward
hesitated
to
approach
the
and
it
was
all
in
vain
that
i
assured
them
that
my
cheetah
was
not
dangerous
no
one
would
open
the
cage
and
it
was
carried
out
into
the
garden
i
asked
for
a
hammer
in
order
to
open
the
door
of
the
cage
which
had
been
nailed
down
thus
keeping
the
poor
cheetah
a
prisoner
when
my
domestics
heard
me
ask
for
the
hammer
they
decided
to
open
it
themselves
madame
guérard
and
the
women
servants
watched
from
the
windows
presently
the
door
burst
open
and
the
cheetah
beside
himself
with
joy
sprang
like
a
tiger
out
of
his
cage
wild
with
liberty
he
rushed
at
the
trees
and
made
straight
for
the
dogs
who
all
four
began
to
howl
with
terror
the
parrot
was
excited
and
uttered
shrill
cries
and
the
monkey
shaking
his
cage
about
gnashed
his
teeth
to
distraction
this
concert
in
the
silent
square
made
the
most
prodigious
effect
all
the
windows
were
opened
and
more
than
twenty
faces
appeared
above
my
garden
wall
all
of
them
inquisitive
alarmed
or
furious
i
was
seized
with
a
fit
of
uncontrollable
laughter
and
so
was
my
friend
louise
abbema
nittis
the
painter
who
had
come
to
call
on
me
was
in
the
same
state
and
so
was
gustave
doré
who
had
been
waiting
for
me
ever
since
two
georges
deschamp
an
amateur
musician
with
a
great
deal
of
talent
tried
to
note
down
this
hofmannesque
harmony
whilst
my
friend
georges
clairin
his
back
shaking
with
laughter
sketched
the
scene
the
next
day
in
london
the
chief
topic
of
conversation
was
the
bedlam
that
had
been
let
loose
at
chester
square
so
much
was
made
of
it
that
our
got
came
to
beg
me
not
to
make
such
a
scandal
as
it
reflected
on
the
comédie
française
i
listened
to
him
in
silence
and
when
he
had
finished
i
took
his
hands
with
me
and
i
will
show
you
the
scandal
i
said
i
led
the
way
into
the
garden
followed
by
my
visitor
and
friends
the
cheetah
out
i
said
standing
on
the
steps
like
a
captain
ordering
his
men
to
take
in
a
reef
when
the
cheetah
was
free
the
same
mad
scene
occurred
again
as
on
the
previous
day
see
monsieur
le
doyen
i
said
is
my
are
mad
he
said
kissing
me
it
certainly
is
irresistibly
comic
and
he
laughed
until
the
tears
came
when
he
saw
all
the
heads
appearing
above
the
garden
wall
the
hostilities
continued
though
through
scraps
of
gossip
retailed
by
one
person
to
another
and
from
one
set
to
another
the
french
press
took
it
up
and
so
did
the
english
press
in
spite
of
my
happy
disposition
and
my
contempt
for
tales
i
began
to
feel
irritated
injustice
has
always
roused
me
to
revolt
and
injustice
was
certainly
having
its
fling
i
could
not
do
a
thing
that
was
not
watched
and
blamed
one
day
i
was
complaining
of
this
to
madeleine
brohan
whom
i
loved
dearly
that
adorable
artiste
took
my
face
in
her
hands
and
looking
into
my
eyes
said
poor
dear
you
do
anything
to
prevent
it
you
are
original
without
trying
to
be
so
you
have
a
dreadful
head
of
hair
that
is
naturally
curly
and
rebellious
your
slenderness
is
exaggerated
you
have
a
natural
harp
in
your
throat
and
all
this
makes
of
you
a
creature
apart
which
is
a
crime
of
high
treason
against
all
that
is
commonplace
that
is
what
is
the
matter
with
you
physically
now
for
your
moral
defects
you
can
not
hide
your
thoughts
you
can
not
stoop
to
anything
you
never
accept
any
compromise
you
will
not
lend
yourself
to
any
hypocrisy
and
all
that
is
a
crime
of
high
treason
against
society
how
can
you
expect
under
these
conditions
not
to
arouse
jealousy
not
to
wound
susceptibilities
and
not
to
make
them
spiteful
if
you
are
discouraged
because
of
these
attacks
it
will
be
all
over
with
you
as
you
will
have
no
strength
left
to
withstand
them
in
that
case
i
advise
you
to
brush
your
hair
to
put
oil
on
it
and
so
make
it
lie
as
sleek
as
that
of
the
famous
corsican
but
even
that
would
never
do
for
napoleon
had
such
sleek
hair
that
it
was
quite
original
well
you
might
try
to
brush
your
hair
as
smooth
as
footnote
prudhon
was
one
of
the
artistes
of
the
théâtre
français
then
there
would
be
no
risk
for
you
i
would
advise
you
she
continued
get
a
little
stouter
and
to
let
your
voice
break
occasionally
then
you
would
not
annoy
any
one
but
if
you
wish
to
remain
my
dear
prepare
to
mount
on
a
little
pedestal
made
of
calumny
scandal
injustice
adulation
flattery
lies
and
truths
when
you
are
once
upon
it
though
do
the
right
thing
and
cement
it
by
your
talent
your
work
and
your
kindness
all
the
spiteful
people
who
have
unintentionally
provided
the
first
materials
for
the
edifice
will
kick
it
then
in
hopes
of
destroying
it
they
will
be
powerless
to
do
this
though
if
you
choose
to
prevent
them
and
that
is
just
what
i
hope
for
you
my
dear
sarah
as
you
have
an
ambitious
thirst
for
glory
i
can
not
understand
that
myself
as
i
only
like
rest
and
i
looked
at
her
with
envy
she
was
so
beautiful
with
her
liquid
eyes
her
face
with
its
pure
restful
lines
and
her
weary
smile
i
wondered
in
an
uneasy
way
if
happiness
were
not
rather
in
this
calm
tranquillity
in
the
disdain
of
all
things
i
asked
her
gently
if
this
were
so
for
i
wanted
to
know
and
she
told
me
that
the
theatre
bored
her
that
she
had
had
so
many
disappointments
she
shuddered
when
she
spoke
of
her
marriage
and
as
to
her
motherhood
that
had
only
caused
her
sorrow
her
love
affairs
had
left
her
with
affections
crushed
and
physically
disabled
the
light
seemed
doomed
to
fade
from
her
beautiful
eyes
her
legs
were
swollen
and
could
scarcely
carry
her
she
told
me
all
this
in
the
same
calm
half
weary
tone
what
had
charmed
me
only
a
short
time
before
chilled
me
to
the
heart
now
for
her
dislike
to
movement
was
caused
by
the
weakness
of
her
eyes
and
her
legs
and
her
delight
in
retirement
was
only
the
love
of
that
peace
which
was
so
necessary
to
her
wounded
as
she
was
by
the
life
she
had
lived
the
love
of
life
though
took
possession
of
me
more
violently
than
ever
i
thanked
my
dear
friend
and
profited
by
her
advice
i
armed
myself
for
the
struggle
preferring
to
die
in
the
midst
of
the
battle
rather
than
to
end
my
life
regretting
that
it
had
been
a
failure
i
made
up
my
mind
not
to
weep
over
the
base
things
that
were
said
about
me
and
not
to
suffer
any
more
injustices
i
made
up
my
mind
too
to
stand
on
the
defensive
and
very
soon
an
occasion
presented
itself
was
to
be
played
for
the
second
time
at
a
june
the
day
before
i
had
sent
word
to
mayer
that
i
was
not
well
and
that
as
i
was
playing
in
at
night
i
should
be
glad
if
he
could
change
the
play
announced
for
the
afternoon
if
possible
the
advance
booking
however
was
more
than
and
the
committee
would
not
hear
of
it
well
got
said
to
mayer
must
give
the
to
some
one
else
if
sarah
bernhardt
can
not
play
there
will
be
croizette
madeleine
brohan
coquelin
febvre
and
myself
in
the
cast
and
diable
it
seems
to
me
that
all
of
us
together
will
make
up
for
mademoiselle
coquelin
was
requested
to
ask
lloyd
to
take
my
part
as
she
had
played
this
at
the
comédie
when
i
was
lloyd
was
afraid
to
undertake
it
though
and
refused
it
was
decided
to
change
the
play
and
was
given
instead
of
nearly
all
the
public
however
asked
to
have
their
money
refunded
and
the
receipts
which
would
have
been
about
only
amounted
to
all
the
spite
and
jealousy
now
broke
loose
and
the
whole
company
of
the
comédie
more
particularly
the
men
with
the
exception
of
worms
started
a
campaign
against
me
francisque
sarcey
as
beat
the
measure
with
his
terrible
pen
in
his
hand
the
most
foolish
slanderous
and
stupid
inventions
and
the
most
odious
lies
took
their
flight
like
a
cloud
of
wild
ducks
and
swooped
suddenly
down
upon
all
the
newspapers
that
were
against
me
it
was
said
that
for
a
shilling
any
one
might
see
me
dressed
as
a
man
that
i
smoked
huge
cigars
leaning
on
the
balcony
of
my
house
that
at
the
various
receptions
where
i
gave
plays
i
took
my
maid
with
me
to
play
a
small
part
that
i
practised
fencing
in
my
garden
dressed
as
a
pierrot
in
white
and
that
when
taking
boxing
lessons
i
had
broken
two
teeth
of
my
unfortunate
professor
some
of
my
friends
advised
me
to
take
no
notice
of
all
these
turpitudes
assuring
me
that
the
public
could
not
possibly
believe
them
they
were
mistaken
though
for
the
public
likes
to
believe
bad
things
about
any
one
as
these
are
always
more
amusing
than
the
good
things
i
soon
had
a
proof
that
the
english
public
was
beginning
to
believe
what
the
french
papers
said
i
received
a
letter
from
a
tailor
asking
me
if
i
would
consent
to
wear
a
coat
of
his
make
when
i
appeared
in
masculine
attire
and
not
only
did
he
offer
me
this
coat
for
nothing
but
he
was
willing
to
pay
me
a
hundred
pounds
if
i
would
wear
it
this
man
was
an
person
but
he
was
sincere
i
received
several
boxes
of
cigars
and
the
boxing
and
fencing
professors
wrote
to
offer
their
services
gratuitously
all
this
annoyed
me
to
such
a
degree
that
i
resolved
to
put
an
end
to
it
an
article
by
albert
wolff
in
the
paris
caused
me
to
take
steps
to
cut
matters
short
this
is
what
i
wrote
in
reply
to
the
article
in
the
june
wolff
paris
you
too
my
dear
monsieur
wolff
you
believe
in
such
insanities
who
can
have
been
giving
you
such
false
information
yes
you
are
my
friend
though
for
in
spite
of
all
the
infamies
you
have
been
told
you
have
still
a
little
indulgence
left
well
then
i
give
you
my
word
of
honour
that
i
have
never
dressed
as
a
man
here
in
london
i
did
not
even
bring
my
sculptor
costume
with
me
i
give
the
most
emphatic
denial
to
this
misrepresentation
i
only
went
once
to
the
exhibition
which
i
organised
and
that
was
on
the
opening
day
for
which
i
had
only
sent
out
a
few
private
invitations
so
that
no
one
paid
a
shilling
to
see
me
it
is
true
that
i
have
accepted
some
private
engagements
to
act
but
you
know
that
i
am
one
of
the
least
remunerated
members
of
the
comédie
française
i
certainly
have
the
right
therefore
to
try
to
make
up
the
difference
i
have
ten
pictures
and
eight
pieces
of
sculpture
on
exhibition
that
too
is
quite
true
but
as
i
brought
them
over
here
to
sell
really
i
must
show
them
as
to
the
respect
due
to
the
house
of
molière
dear
monsieur
wolff
i
lay
claim
to
keeping
that
in
mind
more
than
any
one
else
for
i
am
absolutely
incapable
of
inventing
such
calumnies
for
the
sake
of
slaying
one
of
its
and
now
if
the
stupidities
invented
about
me
have
annoyed
the
parisians
and
if
they
have
decided
to
receive
me
ungraciously
on
my
return
i
do
not
wish
any
one
to
be
guilty
of
such
baseness
on
my
account
so
i
will
send
in
my
resignation
to
the
comédie
française
if
the
london
public
is
tired
of
all
this
fuss
and
should
be
inclined
to
show
me
instead
of
the
indulgence
hitherto
accorded
me
i
shall
ask
the
comédie
to
allow
me
to
leave
england
in
order
to
spare
our
company
the
annoyance
of
seeing
one
of
its
members
hooted
at
and
hissed
i
am
sending
you
this
letter
by
wire
as
the
consideration
i
have
for
public
opinion
gives
me
the
right
to
commit
this
little
folly
and
i
beg
you
dear
monsieur
wolff
to
accord
to
my
letter
the
same
honour
as
you
did
to
the
calumnies
of
my
with
very
kind
regards
sincerely
this
telegram
caused
much
ink
to
flow
whilst
treating
me
as
a
spoiled
child
people
generally
agreed
that
i
was
quite
right
the
comédie
was
most
amiable
perrin
the
manager
wrote
me
an
affectionate
letter
begging
me
to
give
up
my
idea
of
leaving
the
company
the
women
were
most
friendly
croizette
came
to
see
me
and
putting
her
arms
round
me
said
me
you
do
such
a
thing
my
dear
foolish
child
you
really
send
in
your
resignation
in
the
first
place
it
would
not
be
accepted
i
can
answer
for
that
talked
to
me
of
art
and
of
probity
his
whole
speech
savoured
of
protestantism
there
are
several
protestant
pastors
in
his
family
and
this
influenced
him
unconsciously
delaunay
surnamed
father
candour
came
solemnly
to
inform
me
of
the
bad
impression
my
telegram
had
made
he
told
me
that
the
comédie
française
was
a
ministry
that
there
was
the
minister
the
secretary
the
and
the
and
that
each
one
must
conform
to
the
rules
and
bring
in
his
share
either
of
talent
or
work
and
so
on
and
so
on
i
saw
coquelin
at
the
theatre
in
the
evening
he
came
to
me
with
outstretched
hands
know
i
compliment
you
he
said
your
rash
action
but
with
good
luck
we
shall
make
you
change
your
mind
when
one
has
the
good
fortune
and
the
honour
of
belonging
to
the
comédie
française
one
must
remain
there
until
the
end
of
frédéric
febvre
pointed
out
to
me
that
i
ought
to
stay
with
the
comédie
because
it
would
save
money
for
me
and
i
was
quite
incapable
of
doing
that
myself
me
he
said
we
are
with
the
comédie
we
must
not
leave
it
means
our
bread
provided
for
us
later
got
our
then
approached
me
you
know
what
you
are
doing
in
sending
in
your
resignation
he
asked
i
replied
are
mistaken
i
answered
am
not
deserting
i
am
changing
others
then
came
to
me
and
they
all
gave
me
advice
tinged
by
their
own
personality
mounet
as
a
seer
or
believer
delaunay
prompted
by
his
bureaucratic
soul
coquelin
as
a
politician
blaming
another
ideas
but
extolling
them
later
on
and
putting
them
into
practice
for
his
own
profit
febvre
a
lover
of
respectability
got
as
a
selfish
old
growler
understanding
nothing
but
the
orders
of
the
powers
that
be
and
advancement
as
ordained
on
hierarchical
lines
worms
said
to
me
in
his
melancholy
way
they
be
better
towards
you
elsewhere
worms
had
the
most
dreamy
soul
and
the
most
frank
straightforward
character
of
any
member
of
our
illustrious
company
i
liked
him
immensely
we
were
about
to
return
to
paris
and
i
wanted
to
forget
all
these
things
for
a
time
i
was
in
a
hesitating
mood
i
postponed
taking
a
definite
decision
the
stir
that
had
been
made
about
me
the
good
that
had
been
said
in
my
favour
and
the
bad
things
written
against
me
all
this
combined
had
created
in
the
artistic
world
an
atmosphere
of
battle
when
on
the
point
of
leaving
for
paris
some
of
my
friends
felt
very
anxious
about
the
reception
which
i
should
get
there
the
public
is
very
much
mistaken
in
imagining
that
the
agitation
made
about
celebrated
artistes
is
in
reality
instigated
by
the
persons
concerned
and
that
they
do
it
purposely
irritated
at
seeing
the
same
name
constantly
appearing
on
every
occasion
the
public
declares
that
the
artiste
who
is
being
either
slandered
or
pampered
is
an
ardent
lover
of
publicity
alas
three
times
over
alas
we
are
victims
of
the
said
advertisement
those
who
know
the
joys
and
miseries
of
celebrity
when
they
have
passed
the
age
of
forty
know
how
to
defend
themselves
they
are
at
the
beginning
of
a
series
of
small
worries
thunderbolts
hidden
under
flowers
but
they
know
how
to
hold
in
check
that
monster
advertisement
it
is
a
sort
of
octopus
with
innumerable
tentacles
it
throws
out
on
the
right
and
on
the
left
in
front
and
behind
its
clammy
arms
and
gathers
in
through
its
thousand
little
inhaling
organs
all
the
gossip
and
slander
and
praise
afloat
to
spit
out
again
at
the
public
when
it
is
vomiting
its
black
gall
but
those
who
are
caught
in
the
clutches
of
celebrity
at
the
age
of
twenty
know
nothing
i
remember
that
the
first
time
a
reporter
came
to
me
i
drew
myself
up
straight
and
was
as
red
as
a
with
joy
i
was
just
seventeen
years
old
i
had
been
acting
in
a
private
house
and
had
taken
the
part
of
richelieu
with
immense
success
this
gentleman
came
to
call
on
me
at
home
and
asked
me
first
one
question
and
then
another
and
then
another
i
answered
and
chattered
and
was
wild
with
pride
and
excitement
he
took
notes
and
i
kept
looking
at
my
mother
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
was
getting
taller
i
had
to
kiss
my
mother
by
way
of
keeping
my
composure
and
i
hid
my
face
on
her
shoulder
to
hide
my
delight
finally
the
gentleman
rose
shook
hands
with
me
and
then
took
his
departure
i
skipped
about
in
the
room
and
began
to
turn
round
singing
petits
pâtés
ma
chemise
when
suddenly
the
door
opened
and
the
gentleman
said
to
mamma
madame
i
forgot
this
is
the
receipt
for
the
subscription
to
the
journal
it
is
a
mere
nothing
only
sixteen
francs
a
mamma
did
not
understand
at
first
as
for
me
i
stood
still
with
my
mouth
open
unable
to
digest
my
mamma
then
paid
the
sixteen
francs
and
in
her
pity
for
me
as
i
was
crying
by
that
time
she
stroked
my
hair
gently
since
then
i
have
been
delivered
over
to
the
monster
bound
hand
and
foot
and
i
have
been
and
still
am
accused
of
adoring
advertisement
and
to
think
that
my
first
claims
to
celebrity
were
my
extraordinary
thinness
and
delicate
health
i
had
scarcely
made
my
when
epigrams
puns
jokes
and
caricatures
concerning
me
were
indulged
in
by
every
one
to
their
content
was
it
really
for
the
sake
of
advertising
myself
that
i
was
so
thin
so
small
so
weak
and
was
it
for
this
too
that
i
remained
in
bed
six
months
of
the
year
laid
low
by
illness
my
name
became
celebrated
before
i
was
myself
on
the
first
night
of
louis
piece
at
the
odeon
flaubert
who
was
an
intimate
friend
of
the
author
introduced
an
of
the
british
embassy
to
me
i
have
known
you
for
some
time
mademoiselle
he
said
are
the
little
stick
with
the
sponge
on
the
this
caricature
of
me
had
just
appeared
and
had
been
the
delight
of
idle
folks
i
was
quite
a
young
girl
at
that
time
and
nothing
of
that
kind
hurt
me
or
troubled
me
in
the
first
place
all
the
doctors
had
given
me
up
so
that
i
was
indifferent
about
things
but
all
the
doctors
were
mistaken
and
twenty
years
later
i
had
to
fight
against
the
monster
xxix
the
comédie
française
returns
to
comments
on
actors
and
actresses
of
the
day
the
return
of
the
comédie
to
its
home
was
an
event
but
an
event
that
was
kept
quiet
our
departure
from
paris
had
been
very
lively
and
gay
and
quite
a
public
function
our
return
was
clandestine
for
many
of
the
members
and
for
me
among
the
number
it
was
a
doleful
return
for
those
who
had
not
been
appreciated
whilst
those
who
had
been
failures
were
furious
i
had
not
been
back
home
an
hour
when
perrin
was
announced
he
began
to
reproach
me
gently
about
the
little
care
i
took
of
my
health
he
said
i
caused
too
much
fuss
to
be
made
about
me
i
exclaimed
it
my
fault
if
i
am
too
thin
is
it
my
fault
too
if
my
hair
is
too
curly
and
if
i
think
just
as
other
people
do
supposing
that
i
took
sufficient
arsenic
during
a
month
to
make
me
swell
out
like
a
barrel
and
supposing
i
were
to
shave
my
head
like
an
arab
and
only
answer
to
everything
you
said
people
would
declare
i
did
it
for
my
dear
child
answered
perrin
are
people
who
are
neither
fat
nor
thin
neither
close
shaven
nor
with
shocks
of
hair
and
who
answer
and
i
was
simply
petrified
by
the
justice
and
reason
of
this
remark
and
i
understood
the
of
all
the
i
had
been
asking
myself
for
some
years
there
was
no
happy
medium
about
me
i
was
and
little
and
i
felt
that
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
for
this
i
owned
it
to
perrin
and
told
him
that
he
was
quite
right
he
took
advantage
of
my
mood
to
lecture
me
and
advise
me
not
to
put
in
an
appearance
at
the
opening
ceremony
that
was
soon
to
take
place
at
the
comédie
he
feared
a
cabal
against
me
some
people
were
rather
excited
rightly
or
wrongly
a
little
of
both
he
added
in
that
shrewd
and
courteous
way
which
was
peculiar
to
him
i
listened
to
him
without
interrupting
which
slightly
embarrassed
him
for
perrin
was
an
arguer
but
not
an
orator
when
he
had
finished
i
said
have
told
me
too
many
things
that
excite
me
monsieur
perrin
i
love
a
battle
and
i
shall
appear
at
the
ceremony
you
see
i
have
already
been
warned
about
it
here
are
three
anonymous
letters
read
this
one
it
is
the
he
unfolded
the
letter
which
was
perfumed
with
amber
and
read
as
follows
poor
skeleton
you
will
do
well
not
to
show
your
horrible
jewish
nose
at
the
opening
ceremony
the
day
after
i
fear
that
it
would
serve
as
a
target
for
all
the
potatoes
that
are
now
being
cooked
specially
for
you
in
your
kind
city
of
paris
have
some
paragraphs
put
in
the
papers
to
the
effect
that
you
have
been
spitting
blood
and
remain
in
bed
and
think
over
the
consequence
of
excessive
advertisement
perrin
pushed
the
letter
away
from
him
in
disgust
are
two
more
i
said
they
are
so
coarse
that
i
will
spare
you
i
shall
go
to
the
opening
replied
perrin
is
a
rehearsal
shall
you
come
shall
come
i
answered
the
next
day
at
the
rehearsal
not
one
of
the
artistes
man
or
woman
seemed
to
care
about
going
on
to
the
stage
to
bow
with
me
i
must
say
though
that
they
all
showed
nevertheless
much
good
grace
i
declared
however
that
i
would
go
on
alone
although
it
was
against
the
rule
for
i
thought
i
ought
to
face
the
ill
humour
and
the
cabal
alone
the
house
was
crowded
when
the
curtain
rose
the
ceremony
commenced
in
the
midst
of
the
public
was
delighted
to
see
its
beloved
artistes
again
they
advanced
two
by
two
one
on
the
right
and
the
other
on
the
left
holding
the
palm
or
the
crown
to
be
placed
on
the
pedestal
of
bust
my
turn
came
and
i
advanced
alone
i
felt
that
i
was
pale
and
then
livid
with
a
will
that
was
determined
to
conquer
i
went
forward
slowly
towards
the
footlights
but
instead
of
bowing
as
my
comrades
had
done
i
stood
up
erect
and
gazed
with
my
two
eyes
into
all
the
eyes
turning
towards
me
i
had
been
warned
of
the
battle
and
i
did
not
wish
to
provoke
it
but
i
would
not
fly
from
it
i
waited
a
second
and
i
felt
the
thrill
and
the
emotion
that
ran
through
the
house
and
then
suddenly
stirred
by
an
impulse
of
generous
kindliness
the
whole
house
burst
into
wild
applause
and
shouts
the
public
so
beloved
and
so
loving
was
intoxicated
with
joy
that
evening
was
certainly
one
of
the
finest
triumphs
of
my
whole
career
some
artistes
were
delighted
especially
the
women
for
there
is
one
thing
to
remark
with
regard
to
our
art
the
men
are
more
jealous
of
the
women
than
the
women
are
amongst
themselves
i
have
met
with
many
enemies
among
male
comedians
and
with
very
few
among
actresses
i
think
that
the
dramatic
art
is
essentially
feminine
to
paint
face
to
hide
real
feelings
to
try
to
please
and
to
endeavour
to
attract
attention
these
are
all
faults
for
which
we
blame
women
and
for
which
great
indulgence
is
shown
these
same
defects
seem
odious
in
a
man
and
yet
the
actor
must
endeavour
to
be
as
attractive
as
possible
even
if
he
is
obliged
to
have
recourse
to
paint
and
to
false
beard
and
hair
he
may
be
a
republican
and
he
must
uphold
with
warmth
and
conviction
royalist
theories
he
may
be
a
conservative
and
must
maintain
anarchist
principles
if
such
be
the
good
pleasure
of
the
author
at
the
théâtre
français
poor
maubant
was
a
most
advanced
radical
and
his
stature
and
handsome
face
doomed
him
to
play
the
parts
of
kings
emperors
and
tyrants
as
long
as
the
rehearsals
went
on
charlemagne
or
caesar
could
be
heard
swearing
at
tyrants
cursing
the
conquerors
and
claiming
the
hardest
punishments
for
them
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
struggle
between
the
man
and
the
actor
perhaps
this
perpetual
abstraction
from
himself
gives
the
comedian
a
more
feminine
nature
however
that
may
be
it
is
certain
that
the
actor
is
jealous
of
the
actress
the
courtesy
of
the
man
vanishes
before
the
footlights
and
the
comedian
who
in
private
life
would
render
a
service
to
a
woman
in
any
difficulty
will
pick
a
quarrel
with
her
on
the
stage
he
would
risk
his
life
to
save
her
from
any
danger
in
the
road
on
the
railway
or
in
a
boat
but
when
once
on
the
boards
he
will
not
do
anything
to
help
her
out
of
a
difficulty
if
her
memory
should
fail
or
if
she
should
make
a
false
step
he
would
not
hesitate
to
push
her
i
am
going
a
long
way
perhaps
but
not
so
far
as
people
may
think
i
have
performed
with
some
celebrated
comedians
who
have
played
me
some
bad
tricks
on
the
other
hand
there
are
some
actors
who
are
admirable
and
who
are
more
men
than
comedians
when
on
the
stage
pierre
berton
worms
and
guitry
are
and
always
will
be
the
most
perfect
models
of
friendly
and
protecting
courtesy
towards
the
woman
comedian
i
have
played
in
a
number
of
pieces
with
each
of
them
and
subject
as
i
am
to
stage
fright
i
have
always
felt
perfect
confidence
when
acting
with
these
three
artistes
i
knew
that
their
intelligence
was
of
a
high
order
that
they
had
pity
on
me
for
my
fright
and
that
they
would
be
prepared
for
any
nervous
weaknesses
caused
by
it
pierre
berton
and
worms
both
of
them
very
great
artistes
left
the
stage
in
full
artistic
vigour
and
vital
strength
pierre
berton
to
devote
himself
to
literature
and
worms
no
one
knows
why
as
to
guitry
much
the
youngest
of
the
three
he
is
now
the
first
artist
on
the
french
stage
for
he
is
an
admirable
comedian
and
at
the
same
time
an
artist
a
very
rare
thing
i
know
very
few
artistes
in
france
or
in
other
countries
with
these
two
qualities
combined
henry
irving
was
an
admirable
artist
but
not
a
comedian
coquelin
is
an
admirable
comedian
but
he
is
not
an
artist
has
genius
which
he
sometimes
places
at
the
service
of
the
artist
and
sometimes
at
the
service
of
the
comedian
but
on
the
other
hand
he
sometimes
gives
us
exaggerations
as
artist
and
comedian
which
make
lovers
of
beauty
and
truth
gnash
their
teeth
bartet
is
a
perfect
with
a
very
delicate
artistic
sense
réjane
is
the
most
comedian
of
comedians
and
an
artist
when
she
wishes
to
be
eleonora
duse
is
more
a
comedian
than
an
artist
she
walks
in
paths
that
have
been
traced
out
by
others
she
does
not
imitate
them
certainly
not
for
she
plants
flowers
where
there
were
trees
and
trees
where
there
were
flowers
but
she
has
never
by
her
art
made
a
single
personage
stand
out
identified
by
her
name
she
has
not
created
a
being
or
a
vision
which
reminds
one
of
herself
she
puts
on
other
gloves
but
she
puts
them
on
inside
out
and
all
this
she
has
done
with
infinite
grace
and
with
careless
unconsciousness
she
is
a
great
comedian
a
very
great
comedian
but
not
a
great
artist
novelli
is
a
comedian
of
the
old
school
which
did
not
trouble
much
about
the
artistic
side
he
is
perfect
in
laughter
and
tears
beatrice
patrick
campbell
is
especially
an
artist
and
her
talent
is
that
of
charm
and
thought
she
execrates
beaten
paths
she
wants
to
create
and
she
creates
antoine
is
often
betrayed
by
his
own
powers
for
his
voice
is
heavy
and
his
general
appearance
rather
ordinary
as
a
comedian
there
is
therefore
often
much
to
be
desired
but
he
is
always
an
artist
without
equal
and
our
art
owes
much
to
him
in
its
evolution
in
the
direction
of
truth
antoine
too
is
not
jealous
of
the
actress
xxx
my
departure
from
the
comédie
for
my
first
american
tour
another
visit
to
london
the
days
which
followed
the
return
of
the
comédie
to
its
own
home
were
very
trying
for
me
our
manager
wanted
to
subdue
me
and
he
tortured
me
with
a
thousand
little
which
were
much
more
painful
for
a
nature
like
mine
than
so
many
stabs
with
a
knife
at
least
i
imagine
so
as
i
have
never
had
any
i
became
irritable
on
the
slightest
provocation
and
was
in
fact
ill
i
had
always
been
gay
and
now
i
was
sad
my
health
which
had
ever
been
feeble
was
endangered
by
this
state
of
chaos
perrin
gave
me
the
of
the
to
study
i
detested
the
piece
and
did
not
like
the
part
and
i
considered
the
lines
of
very
bad
poetry
indeed
as
i
can
not
dissimulate
well
in
a
fit
of
temper
i
said
this
straight
out
to
emile
augier
and
he
avenged
himself
in
a
most
discourteous
way
on
the
first
opportunity
that
presented
itself
this
was
on
the
occasion
of
my
definite
rupture
with
the
comédie
française
the
day
after
the
first
performance
of
on
saturday
april
i
was
not
ready
to
play
my
part
and
the
proof
of
this
was
a
letter
i
wrote
to
perrin
on
april
regret
very
much
my
dear
monsieur
perrin
i
said
i
have
such
a
sore
throat
that
i
can
not
speak
and
am
obliged
to
stay
in
bed
will
you
kindly
excuse
me
it
was
at
that
wretched
trocadéro
that
i
took
cold
on
sunday
i
am
very
much
worried
as
i
know
it
will
cause
you
inconvenience
anyhow
i
will
be
ready
for
saturday
whatever
happens
a
thousand
excuses
and
kind
regards
i
was
able
to
play
as
i
had
recovered
from
my
sore
throat
but
i
had
not
studied
my
part
during
the
three
days
as
i
could
not
speak
i
had
not
been
able
to
try
on
my
costumes
either
as
i
had
been
in
bed
all
the
time
on
friday
i
went
to
ask
perrin
to
put
off
the
performance
of
until
the
next
week
he
replied
that
it
was
impossible
that
every
seat
was
booked
and
that
the
piece
had
to
be
played
the
following
tuesday
for
the
subscription
night
i
let
myself
be
persuaded
to
act
as
i
had
confidence
in
my
star
i
said
to
myself
shall
get
through
it
all
i
did
not
get
through
it
though
or
rather
i
came
through
it
very
badly
my
costume
was
a
failure
it
did
not
fit
me
they
had
always
jeered
at
me
for
my
thinness
and
in
this
dress
i
looked
like
an
english
my
voice
was
still
rather
hoarse
which
very
much
disconcerted
me
i
played
the
first
part
of
the
very
badly
and
the
second
part
rather
better
at
a
certain
moment
during
the
scene
of
violence
i
was
standing
up
resting
my
two
hands
on
the
table
on
which
there
was
a
lighted
candelabra
there
was
a
cry
raised
in
the
house
for
my
hair
was
very
near
to
the
flame
the
following
day
one
of
the
papers
said
that
as
i
felt
things
were
all
going
wrong
i
wanted
to
set
my
hair
on
fire
so
that
the
piece
should
come
to
an
end
before
i
failed
completely
that
was
certainly
the
very
climax
of
stupidity
the
press
did
not
praise
me
and
the
press
was
quite
right
i
had
played
badly
looked
ugly
and
been
in
a
bad
temper
but
i
considered
that
there
was
nevertheless
a
want
of
courtesy
and
indulgence
with
regard
to
me
auguste
vitu
in
the
of
april
finished
his
article
with
the
phrase
new
clorinde
the
adventuress
in
the
last
two
acts
made
some
gestures
with
her
arms
and
movements
of
her
body
which
one
regrets
to
see
taken
from
virginie
of
and
introduced
at
the
comédie
the
only
fault
which
i
never
have
had
which
i
never
shall
have
is
vulgarity
that
was
an
injustice
and
a
determination
to
hurt
my
feelings
vitu
was
no
friend
of
mine
but
i
understood
from
this
way
of
attacking
me
that
petty
hatreds
were
lifting
up
their
rattlesnake
heads
all
the
little
viper
world
was
crawling
about
under
my
flowers
and
my
laurels
i
had
known
what
was
going
on
for
a
long
time
and
sometimes
i
had
heard
rattling
behind
the
scenes
i
wanted
to
have
the
enjoyment
of
hearing
them
all
rattle
together
and
so
i
threw
my
laurels
and
my
flowers
to
the
four
winds
of
heaven
in
the
most
abrupt
way
i
broke
the
contract
which
bound
me
to
the
comédie
française
and
through
that
to
paris
i
shut
myself
up
all
the
morning
and
after
endless
discussions
with
myself
i
decided
to
send
in
my
resignation
to
the
comédie
i
therefore
wrote
to
perrin
this
letter
the
director
have
compelled
me
to
play
when
i
was
not
ready
you
have
only
allowed
me
eight
rehearsals
on
the
stage
and
the
play
has
been
rehearsed
in
its
entirety
only
three
times
i
was
unwilling
to
appear
before
the
public
you
insisted
absolutely
what
i
foresaw
has
happened
the
result
of
the
performance
has
surpassed
my
anticipations
a
critic
pretended
that
i
played
virginie
of
instead
of
dona
clorinde
of
may
emile
augier
and
zola
absolve
me
it
is
my
first
rebuff
at
the
comédie
it
shall
be
my
last
i
warned
you
on
the
day
of
the
dress
rehearsal
you
have
gone
too
far
i
keep
my
word
by
the
time
you
receive
this
letter
i
shall
have
left
paris
will
you
kindly
accept
my
immediate
resignation
and
believe
me
sincerely
in
order
that
this
resignation
might
not
be
refused
at
the
committee
meeting
i
sent
copies
of
my
letter
to
the
and
the
and
it
was
published
at
the
same
time
as
perrin
received
it
then
quite
decided
not
to
be
influenced
by
anybody
i
set
off
at
once
with
my
maid
for
hâvre
i
had
left
orders
that
no
one
was
to
be
told
where
i
was
and
the
first
evening
i
was
there
i
passed
in
strict
incognito
but
the
next
morning
i
was
recognised
and
telegrams
were
sent
to
paris
to
that
effect
i
was
besieged
by
reporters
i
took
refuge
at
la
hêve
where
i
spent
the
whole
day
on
the
beach
in
spite
of
the
cold
rain
which
fell
unceasingly
i
went
back
to
the
hôtel
frascati
frozen
and
in
the
night
i
was
so
feverish
that
gibert
was
requested
to
call
madame
guérard
who
was
sent
for
by
my
alarmed
maid
came
at
once
i
was
feverish
for
two
days
during
this
time
the
newspapers
continued
to
pour
out
a
flood
of
ink
on
paper
this
turned
to
bitterness
and
i
was
accused
of
the
worst
misdeeds
the
committee
sent
a
to
my
hotel
in
the
avenue
de
villiers
and
this
man
declared
that
after
having
knocked
three
times
at
the
door
and
having
received
no
answer
he
had
left
copy
this
man
was
lying
in
the
hotel
there
were
my
son
and
his
tutor
my
steward
the
husband
of
my
maid
my
butler
the
cook
the
the
second
maid
and
five
dogs
but
it
was
all
in
vain
that
i
protested
against
this
minion
of
the
law
it
was
useless
the
comédie
must
according
to
the
rules
send
me
three
summonses
this
was
not
done
and
a
was
commenced
against
me
it
was
lost
in
advance
maître
allou
the
advocate
of
the
comédie
française
invented
wicked
little
histories
about
me
he
took
pleasure
in
trying
to
make
me
ridiculous
he
had
a
big
file
of
letters
from
me
to
perrin
letters
which
i
had
written
in
softer
moments
or
in
anger
perrin
had
kept
them
all
even
the
shortest
notes
i
had
kept
none
of
his
the
few
letters
from
perrin
to
myself
which
have
been
published
were
given
by
him
from
his
book
of
course
he
only
showed
those
which
could
inspire
the
public
with
an
idea
of
his
paternal
kindness
to
me
the
pleading
of
maître
allou
was
very
successful
he
claimed
three
hundred
thousand
francs
damages
in
addition
to
the
confiscation
for
the
benefit
of
the
comédie
française
of
the
thousand
francs
which
that
theatre
owed
me
maître
barboux
was
my
advocate
he
was
an
intimate
friend
of
perrin
he
defended
me
very
indifferently
i
was
condemned
to
pay
a
hundred
thousand
francs
to
the
comédie
française
and
to
lose
the
thousand
francs
which
i
had
left
with
the
management
i
may
say
that
i
did
not
trouble
much
about
this
three
days
after
my
resignation
jarrett
called
upon
me
he
proposed
to
me
for
the
third
time
to
make
a
contract
for
america
this
time
i
lent
an
ear
to
his
propositions
we
had
never
spoken
about
terms
and
this
is
what
he
proposed
five
thousand
francs
for
each
performance
and
of
the
receipts
above
fifteen
thousand
francs
that
is
to
say
the
day
the
receipts
reached
the
sum
of
twenty
thousand
francs
i
should
receive
seven
thousand
five
hundred
francs
in
addition
one
thousand
francs
per
week
for
my
hotel
bill
also
a
special
pullman
car
on
all
railway
journeys
containing
a
bedroom
a
with
a
piano
four
beds
for
my
staff
and
two
cooks
to
cook
for
me
on
the
way
jarrett
was
to
have
ten
per
cent
on
all
sums
received
by
me
i
accepted
everything
i
was
anxious
to
leave
paris
jarrett
immediately
sent
a
telegram
to
abbey
the
great
american
and
he
landed
on
this
side
thirteen
days
later
i
signed
the
contract
made
by
jarrett
which
was
discussed
clause
by
clause
with
the
american
manager
i
was
given
on
signing
the
contract
one
hundred
thousand
francs
as
advance
payment
for
my
expenses
before
departure
i
was
to
play
eight
pieces
phèdre
adrienne
lecouvreur
froufrou
la
dame
aux
camélias
le
sphinx
and
princesse
i
ordered
modern
dresses
at
of
whom
i
was
then
a
customer
at
i
ordered
six
costumes
for
and
four
costumes
for
i
ordered
from
a
young
theatre
named
lepaul
my
costume
for
these
costumes
cost
me
thousand
francs
but
out
of
this
my
costume
for
alone
cost
four
thousand
francs
the
poor
had
embroidered
it
himself
it
was
a
marvel
it
was
brought
to
me
two
days
before
my
departure
and
i
can
not
think
of
this
moment
without
emotion
irritated
by
long
waiting
i
was
writing
an
angry
letter
to
the
when
he
was
announced
at
first
i
received
him
very
badly
but
i
found
him
looking
so
unwell
the
poor
man
that
i
made
him
sit
down
and
asked
how
he
came
to
be
so
i
am
not
at
all
well
he
said
in
such
a
weak
voice
that
i
was
quite
upset
wanted
to
finish
this
dress
and
i
have
worked
at
it
three
days
and
nights
but
look
how
nice
your
costume
is
and
he
spread
it
out
with
loving
respect
before
me
remarked
guérard
little
spot
i
pricked
myself
answered
the
poor
artist
quickly
but
i
had
just
caught
sight
of
a
drop
of
blood
at
the
corner
of
his
lips
he
wiped
it
quickly
away
so
that
it
should
not
fall
on
the
pretty
costume
as
the
other
little
spot
had
done
i
gave
the
artist
the
four
thousand
francs
which
he
took
with
trembling
hands
he
murmured
some
unintelligible
words
and
withdrew
away
this
costume
take
it
away
i
cried
to
petit
and
my
maid
and
i
cried
so
much
that
i
had
the
hiccoughs
all
the
evening
nobody
understood
why
i
was
crying
but
i
reproached
myself
bitterly
for
having
worried
the
poor
man
it
was
plain
that
he
was
dying
and
by
the
force
of
circumstances
i
had
unwittingly
forged
the
first
link
of
the
chain
of
death
which
was
dragging
to
the
tomb
this
youth
of
this
artist
with
a
future
before
him
i
would
never
wear
this
costume
it
is
still
in
its
box
yellowed
with
age
its
gold
embroidery
is
tarnished
by
time
and
the
little
spot
of
blood
has
slightly
eaten
away
the
stuff
as
to
the
poor
artist
i
learnt
of
his
death
during
my
stay
in
london
in
the
month
of
may
for
before
leaving
for
america
i
signed
with
hollingshead
and
mayer
the
of
the
comédie
a
contract
which
bound
me
to
them
from
may
to
june
it
was
during
this
period
that
the
which
the
comédie
française
brought
against
me
was
decided
maître
barboux
did
not
consult
me
about
anything
and
my
success
in
london
which
was
achieved
without
the
help
of
the
comédie
irritated
the
committee
the
press
and
the
public
maître
allou
in
his
pleadings
pretended
that
the
london
public
had
tired
of
me
very
quickly
and
did
not
care
to
come

performances

the

gave
an

while
i
was
in

i
learned
that
i
had
lost
my
lawsuit
court
with
its
as
declares
hereby
that
mlle
sarah
bernhardt
loses
all
the
rights
privileges
and
advantages
resulting
to
her
profit
from
the
engagement
which
she
contracted
with
the
company
by
authentic
decree
of
march
and
condemns
her
to
pay
to
the
plaintiff
in
his
lawful
quality
the
sum
of
one
hundred
thousand
francs
i
gave
my
last
performance
in
london
the
very
day
that
the
papers
published
this
unjust
verdict
i
was
applauded
and
the
public
overwhelmed
me
with
flowers
i
had
taken
with
me
madame
devoyod
mary
jullien
kalb
my
sister
jeanne
pierre
berton
train
talbot
dieudonné
all
artistes
of
great
repute
i
played
all
the
pieces
which
i
was
to
play
in
america
vitu
sarcey
lapommeraye
had
said
so
much
against
me
that
i
was
stupefied
to
learn
from
mayer
that
they
had
arrived
in
london
to
be
present
at
my
performances
i
could
no
longer
understand
what
it
all
meant
i
thought
that
the
parisian
journalists
were
leaving
me
in
peace
at
last
and
here
were
my
worst
enemies
coming
across
the
sea
to
see
and
hear
me
perhaps
they
were
hoping
like
the
englishman
who
followed
the
to
see
him
devoured
by
his
lions
vitu
in
the
had
finished
one
of
his
bitter
articles
with
these
words
we
have
heard
enough
surely
of
mlle
sarah
bernhardt
let
her
go
abroad
with
her
monotonous
voice
and
her
funereal
fantasies
here
we
have
nothing
new
to
learn
from
her
talents
or
her
caprices
sarcey
in
an
equally
bitter
article
of
my
resignation
at
the
comédie
had
finished
in
these
terms
comes
a
time
when
naughty
children
must
go
to
as
to
the
amiable
lapommeraye
he
had
showered
on
my
devoted
head
all
the
rumours
that
he
had
collected
from
all
sides
but
as
they
said
he
had
no
originality
he
tried
to
show
that
he
also
could
dip
his
pen
in
venom
and
he
had
cried
journey
and
here
they
all
came
these
three
and
others
with
them
and
the
day
following
my
first
performance
of
auguste
vitu
telegraphed
to
the
a
long
article
in
which
he
criticised
me
in
certain
scenes
regretting
that
i
had
not
followed
the
example
of
rachel
whom
i
had
never
seen
and
he
finished
his
article
thus
sincerity
of
my
admiration
can
not
be
doubted
when
i
avow
that
in
the
fifth
act
sarah
bernhardt
rose
to
a
height
of
dramatic
power
to
a
force
of
expression
which
could
not
be
surpassed
she
played
the
long
and
cruel
scene
in
which
adrienne
poisoned
by
the
duchesse
de
bouillon
struggles
against
death
in
her
fearful
agony
not
only
with
immense
talent
but
with
a
science
of
art
which
up
to
the
present
she
has
never
revealed
if
the
parisian
public
had
heard
or
ever
hears
mlle
sarah
bernhardt
cry
out
with
the
piercing
accent
which
she
put
into
her
words
that
evening
will
not
die
i
will
not
die
it
would
weep
with
sarcey
finished
an
admirable
critique
with
these
words
is
prodigious
and
lapommeraye
who
had
once
more
become
amiable
begged
me
to
go
back
to
the
comédie
which
was
waiting
for
me
which
would
kill
the
fatted
calf
on
the
return
of
its
prodigal
child
sarcey
in
his
article
in
the
consecrated
five
columns
of
praises
to
me
and
finished
his
article
with
these
words
nothing
can
ever
take
the
place
of
this
last
act
of
at
the
comédie
ah
she
should
have
stayed
at
the
comédie
yes
i
come
back
to
my
litany
i
can
not
help
it
we
shall
lose
as
much
as
she
will
yes
i
know
that
we
can
say
mlle
dudlay
is
left
to
us
oh
she
will
always
stay
with
us
i
can
not
help
saying
it
what
a
pity
what
a
pity
and
eight
days
after
on
june
he
wrote
in
his
theatrical
on
the
first
performance
of
do
not
think
that
the
emotion
at
any
theatre
has
ever
been
so
profound
there
are
in
the
dramatic
art
exceptional
times
when
the
artistes
are
transported
out
of
themselves
carried
above
themselves
and
compelled
to
obey
this
inward
i
should
have
said
who
whispered
to
corneille
his
immortal
verses
said
i
to
mlle
sarah
bernhardt
after
the
play
is
an
evening
which
will
open
to
you
if
you
wish
the
doors
of
the
comédie
française
not
speak
of
it
said
she
me
will
not
speak
of
but
what
a
pity
what
a
pity
my
success
in
was
so
marked
that
it
filled
the
void
left
by
coquelin
who
after
having
signed
with
the
consent
of
perrin
with
messrs
mayer
and
hollingshead
declared
that
he
could
not
keep
his
engagements
it
was
a
nasty
de
by
which
perrin
hoped
to
injure
my
london
performances
he
had
previously
sent
got
to
me
to
ask
officially
if
i
would
not
come
back
to
the
comédie
he
said
i
should
be
permitted
to
make
my
american
tour
and
that
everything
would
be
arranged
on
my
return
but
he
should
not
have
sent
got
he
should
have
sent
worms
or
petit
père
delaunay
the
one
might
have
persuaded
me
by
his
affectionate
reasoning
and
the
other
by
the
falsity
of
arguments
presented
with
such
grace
that
it
would
have
been
difficult
to
refuse
got
declared
that
i
should
be
only
too
happy
to
come
back
to
the
comédie
on
my
return
to
america
you
know
he
added
know
my
little
one
that
you
will
die
in
that
country
and
if
you
come
back
you
will
perhaps
be
only
too
glad
to
return
to
the
comédie
française
for
you
will
be
in
a
bad
state
of
health
and
it
will
take
some
time
before
you
are
right
again
believe
me
sign
and
it
is
not
we
who
will
benefit
by
it
but
you
thank
you
i
answered
i
prefer
to
choose
my
hospital
myself
on
my
return
and
now
you
can
go
and
leave
me
in
i
fancy
i
said
out
that
evening
he
was
present
at
a
performance
of
he
came
to
my
and
said
had
better
sign
believe
me
and
come
back
to
commence
with
i
promise
you
a
happy
return
i
refused
and
finished
my
performances
in
london
without
coquelin
the
average
of
the
receipts
was
nine
thousand
francs
and
i
left
london
with
regret
i
who
had
left
it
with
so
much
pleasure
the
first
time
but
london
is
a
city
apart
its
charm
unveils
little
by
little
the
first
impression
for
a
frenchman
or
woman
is
that
of
keen
suffering
of
mortal
those
tall
houses
with
sash
windows
without
curtains
those
ugly
monuments
all
in
mourning
with
the
dust
and
grime
and
black
and
greasy
dirt
those
at
the
corners
of
all
the
streets
with
faces
sad
as
the
rain
and
bedraggled
feathers
in
their
hats
and
lamentable
clothing
the
black
mud
of
the
streets
the
low
sky
the
funereal
mirth
of
drunken
women
hanging
on
to
men
just
as
drunken
the
wild
dancing
of
dishevelled
children
round
the
street
organs
as
numerous
as
the
omnibuses
all
that
caused
years
ago
an
indefinite
suffering
to
a
parisian
but
little
by
little
one
finds
that
the
profusion
of
the
squares
is
restful
to
the
eyes
that
the
beauty
of
the
aristocratic
ladies
effaces
the
image
of
the
the
constant
movement
of
hyde
park
and
especially
of
rotten
row
fills
the
heart
with
gaiety
the
broad
english
hospitality
which
is
manifested
from
the
first
moment
of
making
an
acquaintance
the
wit
of
the
men
which
compares
favourably
with
the
wit
of
frenchmen
and
their
gallantry
much
more
respectful
and
therefore
much
more
flattering
left
no
regrets
in
me
for
french
gallantry
but
i
prefer
our
pale
mud
to
the
london
black
mud
and
our
windows
opening
in
the
centre
to
the
horrible
sash
windows
i
find
also
that
nothing
marks
more
clearly
the
difference
of
character
of
the
two
nations
than
their
respective
windows
ours
open
wide
the
sun
enters
in
our
houses
even
to
the
heart
of
the
dwelling
the
air
sweeps
away
all
the
dust
and
all
the
microbes
they
shut
in
the
same
manner
simply
as
they
open
english
windows
open
only
either
the
top
half
or
the
bottom
half
one
may
even
have
the
pleasure
of
opening
them
a
little
at
the
top
and
a
little
at
the
bottom
but
not
at
all
in
the
middle
the
sun
can
not
enter
openly
nor
the
air
the
window
keeps
its
selfish
and
perfidious
character
i
hate
the
english
windows
but
now
i
love
london
and
is
there
any
need
to
add
its
inhabitants
since
my
first
visit
i
have
returned
there
times
and
the
public
has
always
remained
faithful
and
affectionate

freedom
i
felt
more
sure
of
life
than
before
although
i
was
very
weak
of
constitution
the
possibility
of
doing
as
i
wanted
without
hindrance
and
without
control
calmed
my
nervous
system
and
my
health
which
had
been
weakened
by
perpetual
irritations
and
by
excessive
work
was
improved
i
reposed
on
the
laurels
which
i
had
gathered
myself
and
i
slept
better
sleeping
better
i
commenced
to
eat
better
and
great
was
the
astonishment
of
my
little
court
when
they
saw
their
idol
come
back
from
london
round
and
rosy
i
remained
several
days
in
paris
then
i
set
out
for
brussels
where
i
was
to
play
and
the
belgian
public
by
which
i
mean
the
brussels
public
is
the
one
most
like
our
own
in
belgium
i
never
feel
that
i
am
in
a
strange
country
our
language
is
the
language
of
the
country
the
horses
and
carriages
are
always
in
perfect
taste
the
fashionable
women
resemble
our
own
fashionable
women
abound
the
hotels
are
as
good
as
in
paris
the
are
as
poor
the
newspapers
are
as
spiteful
brussels
is
gossiping
paris
in
miniature
i
played
for
the
first
time
at
the
théâtre
de
la
monnaie
and
i
felt
uncomfortable
in
that
immense
and
frigid
house
but
the
benevolent
enthusiasm
of
the
public
soon
warmed
me
and
i
shall
never
forget
the
four
performances
i
gave
there
then
i
set
out
for
copenhagen
where
i
was
to
give
five
performances
at
the
theatre
royal
our
arrival
which
doubtless
was
anxiously
expected
really
frightened
me
more
than
two
thousand
persons
who
were
assembled
in
the
station
when
the
train
came
in
gave
a
hurrah
so
terrible
that
i
did
not
know
what
was
happening
but
when
de
fallesen
manager
of
the
theatre
royal
and
the
first
chamberlain
of
the
king
entered
my
compartment
and
begged
me
to
show
myself
at
the
window
to
gratify
the
curiosity
of
the
public
the
hurrahs
began
again
and
then
i
understood
but
a
dreadful
anxiety
now
took
possession
of
me
i
could
never
i
was
sure
rise
to
what
was
expected
from
me
my
slender
frame
would
inspire
disdain
in
those
magnificent
men
and
those
splendid
and
healthy
women
i
stepped
out
of
the
train
so
diminished
by
comparison
that
i
had
the
sensation
of
being
nothing
more
than
a
breath
of
air
and
i
saw
the
crowd
submissive
to
the
police
divide
into
two
compact
lines
leaving
a
wide
path
for
my
carriage
i
passed
slowly
through
this
double
hedge
of
sympathetic
who
threw
me
flowers
and
kisses
and
lifted
their
hats
to
me
in
the
course
of
my
long
career
i
have
had
many
triumphs
receptions
and
ovations
but
my
reception
by
the
danish
people
remains
one
of
my
most
cherished
memories
the
living
hedge
lasted
till
we
reached
the
hôtel
where
i
went
in
after
thanking
once
more
the
sympathetic
friends
who
surrounded
me
in
the
evening
the
king
the
queen
and
their
daughter
the
princess
of
wales
were
present
at
the
first
performance
of
this
is
what
the
of
august
said
bernhardt
has
played
with
a
tremendous
success
before
a
magnificent
audience
the
royal
family
the
king
and
the
queen
of
the
hellenes
as
well
as
the
princess
of
wales
were
present
at
the
performance
the
queens
threw
their
bouquets
to
the
french
artiste
amidst
applause
it
was
an
unprecedented
triumph
the
public
was
delirious
will
be
the
performance
of
was
equally
successful
but
as
i
was
only
playing
every
other
day
i
wanted
to
visit
elsinore
the
king
placed
the
royal
steamer
at
my
disposal
for
this
little
journey
i
had
invited
all
my
company
de
fallesen
the
first
chamberlain
and
manager
of
the
theatre
royal
had
ordered
a
magnificent
lunch
for
us
and
accompanied
by
the
principal
notabilities
of
denmark
we
visited
tomb
the
spring
of
ophelia
and
the
castle
of
marienlyst
then
we
went
over
the
castle
of
kronborg
i
regretted
my
visit
to
elsinore
the
reality
did
not
come
up
to
the
expectation
the
tomb
of
hamlet
is
represented
by
a
small
column
ugly
and
there
is
little
verdure
and
the
desolate
sadness
of
deceit
without
beauty
they
gave
me
a
little
water
from
the
spring
of
ophelia
to
drink
and
the
baron
de
fallesen
broke
the
glass
without
allowing
any
one
else
to
drink
from
the
spring
i
returned
from
this
very
ordinary
journey
feeling
rather
sad
leaning
against
the
side
of
the
vessel
i
watched
the
water
gliding
past
when
i
noticed
a
few
rose
petals
on
the
surface
carried
by
an
invisible
current
they
were
borne
against
the
sides
of
the
boat
then
the
petals
increased
to
thousands
and
in
the
mysterious
sunset
rose
the
melodious
chant
of
the
sons
of
the
north
i
looked
up
in
front
of
us
rocked
on
the
water
by
the
evening
breeze
was
a
pretty
boat
with
outspread
sails
a
score
of
young
men
throwing
handfuls
of
roses
into
the
waters
which
were
carried
to
us
by
the
little
wavelets
were
singing
the
marvellous
legends
of
past
centuries
and
all
that
was
for
me
all
those
roses
all
that
love
all
that
musical
poetry
and
that
setting
sun
was
also
for
me
and
in
this
fleeting
moment
which
brought
all
the
beauty
of
life
near
to
me
i
felt
myself
very
near
to
god
the
following
day
at
the
close
of
the
performance
the
king
sent
for
me
to
come
into
the
royal
box
and
he
decorated
me
with
a
very
pretty
order
of
merit
adorned
with
diamonds
he
kept
me
some
time
in
his
box
asking
me
about
different
things
i
was
presented
to
the
queen
and
i
noticed
immediately
that
she
was
somewhat
deaf
i
was
rather
embarrassed
but
the
queen
of
greece
came
to
my
rescue
she
was
beautiful
but
much
less
so
than
her
lovely
sister
the
princess
of
wales
oh
that
adorable
and
seductive
face
with
the
eyes
of
a
child
of
the
north
and
classic
features
of
virginal
purity
a
long
supple
neck
that
seemed
made
for
queenly
bows
a
sweet
and
almost
timid
smile
the
indefinable
charm
of
this
princess
made
her
so
radiant
that
i
saw
nothing
but
her
and
i
went
from
the
box
leaving
behind
me
i
fear
but
a
poor
opinion
of
my
intelligence
with
the
royal
couples
of
denmark
and
greece
the
evening
before
my
departure
i
was
invited
to
a
grand
supper
fallesen
made
a
speech
and
thanked
us
in
a
very
charming
manner
for
the
which
we
had
given
in
denmark
robert
walt
made
a
very
cordial
speech
on
behalf
of
the
press
very
short
but
very
sympathetic
our
ambassador
in
a
few
courteous
words
thanked
robert
walt
and
then
to
the
general
surprise
baron
magnus
the
prussian
minister
rose
and
in
a
loud
voice
turning
to
me
he
said
drink
to
france
which
gives
us
such
great
artistes
to
france
la
belle
france
whom
we
all
love
so
much
hardly
ten
years
had
passed
since
the
terrible
war
french
men
and
women
were
still
suffering
their
wounds
were
not
healed
baron
magnus
a
really
amiable
and
charming
man
had
from
the
time
of
my
arrival
in
copenhagen
sent
me
flowers
with
his
card
i
had
sent
back
the
flowers
and
begged
an
of
the
english
embassy
sir
francis
i
believe
to
ask
the
german
baron
not
to
renew
his
gifts
the
baron
laughed
and
waited
for
me
as
i
came
out
of
my
hotel
he
came
to
me
with
outstretched
hands
and
spoke
kindly
and
reasonable
words
everybody
was
looking
at
us
and
i
was
embarrassed
it
was
evident
that
he
was
a
kind
man
i
thanked
him
touched
in
spite
of
myself
by
his
frankness
and
i
went
away
quite
undecided
as
to
what
i
really
felt
twice
he
renewed
his
visit
but
i
did
not
receive
him
but
only
bowed
as
i
left
my
hotel
i
was
somewhat
irritated
at
the
tenacity
of
this
amiable
diplomatist
on
the
evening
of
the
supper
when
i
saw
him
take
the
attitude
of
an
orator
i
felt
myself
grow
pale
he
had
barely
finished
his
little
speech
when
i
jumped
to
my
feet
and
cried
us
drink
to
france
but
to
the
whole
of
france
monsieur
de
prusse
i
was
nervous
sensational
and
theatrical
without
intending
it
it
was
like
a
thunderbolt
the
orchestra
of
the
court
which
was
placed
in
the
upper
gallery
began
playing
the
at
this
time
the
danes
hated
the
germans
the
was
suddenly
deserted
as
if
by
enchantment
i
went
up
to
my
rooms
not
wishing
to
be
questioned
i
had
gone
too
far
anger
had
made
me
say
more
than
i
intended
baron
magnus
did
not
deserve
this
thrust
of
mine
and
also
my
instinct
forewarned
me
of
results
to
follow
i
went
to
bed
angry
with
myself
with
the
baron
and
with
all
the
world
about
five
in
the
morning
i
commenced
to
doze
when
i
was
awakened
by
the
growling
of
my
dog
then
i
heard
some
one
knocking
at
the
door
of
the
i
called
my
maid
who
woke
her
husband
and
he
went
to
open
the
door
an
from
the
french
embassy
was
waiting
to
speak
to
me
on
urgent
business
i
put
on
an
ermine
and
went
to
see
the
visitor
beg
you
he
said
write
a
note
immediately
to
explain
that
the
words
you
said
were
not
meant
the
baron
magnus
whom
we
all
respect
is
in
a
very
awkward
situation
and
we
are
all
upset
about
it
prince
bismarck
is
not
to
be
trifled
with
and
it
may
be
very
serious
for
the
i
assure
you
monsieur
i
am
a
hundredfold
more
unhappy
about
it
than
you
for
the
baron
is
a
good
and
charming
man
he
lacked
political
tact
and
in
this
case
it
is
excusable
because
i
am
not
a
woman
of
politics
i
was
lacking
in
coolness
i
would
give
my
right
hand
to
repair
the
ask
you
for
so
much
as
that
as
it
would
spoil
the
beauty
of
your
gestures
he
was
french
you
see
is
the
rough
copy
of
a
letter
will
you
take
it
rewrite
it
sign
it
and
everything
will
be
at
an
end
but
that
was
unacceptable
the
wording
of
this
letter
gave
twisted
and
rather
cowardly
explanations
i
rejected
it
and
after
several
attempts
to
rewrite
it
i
gave
up
in
despair
and
did
nothing
three
hundred
persons
had
been
present
at
the
supper
in
addition
to
the
royal
orchestra
and
the
attendants
everybody
had
heard
the
amiable
but
awkward
speech
of
the
baron
i
had
replied
in
a
very
excited
manner
the
public
and
the
press
had
all
been
witnesses
of
my
we
were
the
victims
of
our
own
foolishness
the
baron
and
myself
if
such
a
thing
were
to
happen
at
the
present
time
i
should
not
care
a
pin
for
public
opinion
and
i
should
even
take
pleasure
in
ridiculing
myself
in
order
to
do
justice
to
a
brave
and
gallant
man
but
at
that
time
i
was
very
nervous
and
uncompromisingly
patriotic
and
also
perhaps
i
thought
i
was
some
one
of
importance
since
then
life
has
taught
me
that
if
one
is
to
be
famous
it
can
only
really
become
manifest
after
death
i
am
going
down
the
hill
of
life
and
i
regard
gaily
all
the
pedestals
on
which
i
have
been
lifted
up
and
there
have
been
so
many
so
many
of
them
that
their
fragments
broken
by
the
same
hands
that
had
raised
them
have
made
me
a
solid
pillar
from
which
i
look
out
on
life
happy
with
what
has
been
and
attentive
to
what
will
be
my
stupid
vanity
had
wounded
one
who
meant
no
harm
and
this
incident
has
always
left
in
me
a
feeling
of
remorse
and
chagrin
i
left
copenhagen
amidst
applause
and
the
repeated
cries
of
la
france
from
all
the
windows
hung
the
french
flag
fluttering
in
the
breeze
and
i
felt
that
this
was
not
only
me
but
germany
i
was
sure
of
it
since
then
the
germans
and
the
danes
are
solidly
united
and
i
am
not
certain
that
several
danes
do
not
still
bear
me
because
of
this
incident
of
the
baron
magnus
i
came
back
to
paris
to
make
final
preparations
for
my
journey
to
america
i
was
to
set
sail
on
october
one
day
in
august
i
was
having
a
reception
of
all
my
friends
who
came
to
see
me
in
full
force
because
i
was
about
to
set
out
for
a
long
journey
among
the
number
were
girardin
count
kapenist
marshal
canrobert
georges
clairin
arthur
meyer
duquesnel
the
beautiful
augusta
holmes
raymond
de
montbel
nordenskjold
and
other
friends
i
chatted
gaily
happy
to
be
surrounded
by
so
many
kind
and
intellectual
friends
girardin
did
all
he
could
to
persuade
me
not
to
undertake
this
journey
to
america
he
had
been
the
friend
of
rachel
and
told
me
the
sad
end
of
her
journey
arthur
meyer
was
of
opinion
that
i
ought
always
to
do
what
i
thought
best
the
other
friends
discussed
the
subject
that
admirable
man
whom
france
will
always
worship
canrobert
said
how
much
he
should
miss
and
regret
those
intimate
at
our
five
teas
said
he
have
not
the
right
to
try
in
our
affectionate
selfishness
to
hinder
our
young
friend
from
doing
all
she
can
in
the
strife
she
is
of
a
combative
yes
i
cried
i
am
born
for
strife
i
feel
it
nothing
pleases
me
like
having
to
master
a
public
perhaps
hostile
who
have
read
and
heard
all
that
the
press
has
said
against
me
but
i
am
sorry
that
i
can
not
play
not
only
in
paris
but
in
all
france
my
two
big
successes
and
to
that
you
can
count
on
me
exclaimed
félix
duquesnel
dear
sarah
you
had
your
first
successes
with
me
and
it
is
with
me
that
you
will
have
your
last
everybody
protested
and
i
jumped
up
one
moment
said
he
successes
until
you
come
back
from
america
if
you
will
consent
you
can
count
on
me
for
everything
i
will
obtain
at
any
price
theatres
in
all
the
large
towns
and
we
will
give
performances
during
the
month
of
september
as
to
financial
arrangements
they
will
be
of
the
simplest
performances
fifty
thousand
francs
i
will
give
you
one
half
of
this
sum
and
sign
a
contract
with
you
so
that
you
will
not
have
time
to
change
your
i
clapped
my
hands
joyfully
all
the
friends
who
were
there
begged
duquesnel
to
send
them
as
soon
as
possible
an
itinerary
of
the
tour
for
they
all
wanted
to
see
me
in
the
two
plays
in
which
i
had
gained
laurels
in
england
belgium
and
denmark
duquesnel
promised
to
send
them
the
details
of
the
tour
and
it
was
settled
that
their
visits
should
be
drawn
by
lot
from
a
little
bag
and
each
town
marked
with
the
date
and
the
name
of
the
play
a
week
later
duquesnel
with
whom
i
had
signed
a
contract
returned
with
the
tour
mapped
out
and
all
the
company
engaged
it
was
almost
miraculous
the
performances
were
to
commence
on
saturday
september
and
there
were
to
be
of
them
and
the
whole
including
the
day
of
departure
and
the
day
of
return
was
to
last
days
which
caused
this
tour
to
be
called
days
of
sarah
bernhardt
like
the
days
of
a
citizen
who
is
obliged
to
accomplish
his
military
service
the
little
tour
was
most
successful
and
i
never
enjoyed
myself
more
than
during
this
artistic
promenade
duquesnel
organised
excursions
and
outside
the
towns
at
first
he
had
prepared
thinking
to
please
me
some
visits
to
the
sights
of
the
towns
he
had
written
beforehand
from
paris
fixing
dates
and
hours
the
guardians
of
the
different
museums
art
galleries
had
offered
to
point
out
to
me
the
finest
objects
in
their
collections
and
the
mayors
had
prepared
visits
to
the
churches
and
celebrated
buildings
when
on
the
eve
of
our
departure
he
showed
us
the
heap
of
letters
each
giving
a
most
amiable
affirmative
i
shrieked
i
hate
seeing
public
buildings
and
having
them
explained
to
me
i
know
most
of
the
public
sights
of
france
but
i
have
visited
them
when
i
felt
inclined
and
with
my
own
chosen
friends
as
to
the
churches
and
other
buildings
i
find
them
very
tiresome
i
can
not
help
it
it
really
wearies
me
to
see
them
i
can
admire
their
outline
in
passing
or
when
i
see
them
silhouetted
against
the
setting
sun
that
is
all
right
but
further
than
that
i
will
not
go
the
idea
of
entering
these
cold
spaces
while
some
one
explains
their
absurd
and
interminable
history
of
looking
up
at
their
ceilings
with
craning
neck
of
cramping
my
feet
by
walking
unnaturally
over
highly
waxed
floors
of
being
obliged
to
admire
the
restoration
of
the
left
wing
that
they
would
have
done
better
to
let
crumble
to
ruins
to
have
some
one
express
wonder
at
the
depth
of
some
moat
which
once
upon
a
time
used
to
be
full
of
water
but
is
now
as
dry
as
the
east
wind
all
that
is
so
tiresome
it
makes
me
want
to
howl
from
my
earliest
childhood
i
have
always
detested
houses
castles
churches
towers
and
all
buildings
higher
than
a
mill
i
love
low
buildings
farms
huts
and
i
positively
adore
mills
because
these
little
buildings
do
not
obstruct
the
horizon
i
have
nothing
to
say
against
the
pyramids
but
i
would
a
hundred
times
rather
they
had
never
been
built
i
begged
duquesnel
to
send
telegrams
at
once
to
all
the
notabilities
who
had
been
so
obliging
we
passed
two
hours
over
this
task
and
on
september
i
set
out
free
joyful
and
content
my
friends
came
to
see
me
while
i
was
on
tour
in
accordance
with
the
lots
they
had
drawn
and
we
had
picnics
by
coach
into
the
surrounding
country
from
all
the
towns
in
which
i
played
i
came
back
to
paris
on
september
and
had
only
just
time
to
prepare
for
my
journey
to
america
i
had
only
been
a
week
in
paris
when
i
had
a
visit
from
bertrand
who
was
then
director
of
the
variétés
his
brother
was
director
of
the
vaudeville
in
partnership
with
raymond
deslandes
i
did
not
know
eugène
bertrand
but
i
received
him
at
once
for
we
had
mutual
friends
are
you
going
to
do
when
you
come
back
from
america
he
asked
me
after
we
had
exchanged
greetings
really
know
nothing
i
have
not
thought
of
i
have
thought
of
something
for
you
and
if
you
like
to
make
your
reappearance
in
paris
in
a
play
of
victorien
i
will
sign
with
you
at
once
for
the
i
cried
vaudeville
what
are
you
thinking
of
raymond
deslandes
is
the
manager
and
he
hates
me
like
poison
because
i
ran
away
from
the
gymnase
the
day
following
the
first
performance
of
his
play
mari
qui
lance
sa
his
play
was
ridiculous
and
i
was
even
more
ridiculous
than
his
play
in
the
part
of
a
young
russian
lady
addicted
to
dancing
and
eating
sandwiches
that
man
will
never
engage
me
he
smiled
brother
is
the
partner
of
raymond
deslandes
my
brother
to
put
it
plainly
is
myself
all
the
money
put
in
the
affair
by
us
is
mine
i
am
the
sole
master
what
salary
do
you
want
i
really
fifteen
hundred
francs
per
performance
suit
you
i
looked
at
him
in
stupefaction
not
quite
sure
if
he
was
in
his
right
mind
monsieur
if
i
do
not
succeed
you
will
lose
money
and
i
can
not
agree
to
not
be
afraid
he
said
can
assure
you
it
will
be
a
success
a
colossal
success
will
you
sign
and
i
will
also
guarantee
you
fifty
performances
no
never
i
will
sign
willingly
for
i
admire
the
talent
of
victorien
sardou
but
i
do
not
want
any
guarantee
success
will
depend
on
victorien
sardou
and
after
him
on
me
so
i
sign
and
thank
you
for
your
at
my
afternoon
teas
i
showed
the
new
contract
to
my
friends
and
they
were
all
of
opinion
that
luck
was
on
my
side
in
the
matter
of
my
resignation
from
the
comédie
française
i
was
to
leave
paris
in
three
days
my
heart
was
sore
at
the
idea
of
leaving
france
for
many
sorrowful
reasons
but
in
these
memoirs
i
have
put
on
one
side
all
that
touches
the
inner
part
of
my
life
there
is
one
family
which
lives
another
life
and
whose
sensations
sorrows
joys
and
griefs
are
born
and
die
for
a
very
small
number
of
hearts
but
i
felt
the
need
of
another
atmosphere
of
vaster
space
of
other
skies
i
left
my
little
boy
with
my
uncle
who
had
five
boys
of
his
own
his
wife
was
rather
a
strict
protestant
but
kind
and
my
cousin
louise
their
eldest
daughter
was
witty
and
highly
intelligent
she
promised
me
to
be
on
the
watch
and
to
let
me
know
at
once
if
there
was
anything
i
ought
to
know
up
to
the
last
moment
people
in
paris
did
not
believe
that
i
would
really
go
my
health
was
so
uncertain
that
it
seemed
folly
to
undertake
such
a
journey
but
when
it
became
absolutely
certain
that
i
was
going
there
was
a
general
concert
of
spiteful
reproaches
the
hue
and
cry
of
my
enemies
was
in
full
swing
i
have
now
under
my
eyes
these
specimens
of
insanity
calumnies
lies
and
stupidities
burlesque
portraits
doleful
pleasantries
to
the
darling
the
idol
the
star
the
zimm
boum
boum
it
was
all
so
absolutely
idiotic
that
i
was
confounded
i
did
not
read
the
greater
part
of
these
articles
but
my
secretary
had
orders
to
cut
them
out
and
paste
them
in
little
whether
favourable
or
unfavourable
it
was
my
godfather
who
had
commenced
doing
this
when
i
entered
the
conservatoire
and
after
his
death
i
had
it
continued
happily
i
find
in
these
thousands
of
lines
fine
and
noble
words
words
written
by
weiss
zola
emile
de
girardin
jules
vallès
jules
lemaître
and
beautiful
verses
full
of
grace
and
justice
signed
victor
hugo
françois
coppée
richepin
haraucourt
henri
de
bornier
catulle
mendès
parodi
and
later
edmond
rostand
i
neither
could
nor
would
suffer
unduly
from
the
calumnies
and
lies
but
i
confess
that
the
kind
appreciation
and
praises
accorded
me
by
the
superior
minds
afforded
me
infinite
joy
xxxii
experiences
and
reflections
on
board
ship
from
hâvre
to
new
york
the
ship
which
was
to
take
me
away
to
other
hopes
other
sensations
and
other
successes
was
named
it
was
the
unlucky
boat
the
boat
that
was
haunted
by
the
gnome
all
kinds
of
misfortunes
accidents
and
storms
had
been
its
lot
it
had
been
blockaded
for
months
with
its
keel
out
of
water
its
stern
had
been
staved
in
by
an
iceland
boat
and
it
had
foundered
on
the
shores
of
newfoundland
i
believe
and
been
set
afloat
again
another
time
fire
had
broken
out
on
it
right
in
the
hâvre
roadstead
but
no
great
damage
was
done
the
poor
boat
had
had
a
celebrated
adventure
which
had
made
it
ridiculous
in
or
a
new
pumping
system
was
adopted
and
although
this
system
had
been
in
use
by
the
english
for
a
long
time
it
was
quite
unknown
aboard
french
boats
the
captain
very
wisely
decided
to
have
these
pumps
worked
by
his
crew
so
that
in
case
of
any
danger
the
men
should
be
ready
to
manipulate
them
easily
the
experiment
had
been
going
on
for
a
few
minutes
when
one
of
the
men
came
to
inform
the
captain
that
the
hold
of
the
ship
was
filling
with
water
and
no
one
could
discover
the
cause
of
it
on
pumping
shouted
the
captain
up
pump
away
the
pumps
were
worked
frantically
and
the
result
was
that
the
hold
filled
entirely
and
the
captain
was
obliged
to
abandon
the
ship
after
seeing
the
passengers
safely
off
in
the
boats
an
english
whaler
met
the
ship
two
days
after
tried
the
pumps
which
worked
admirably
but
in
the
contrary
way
to
that
indicated
by
the
french
captain
this
slight
error
cost
the
compagnie
transatlantique
salvage
money
and
when
they
wanted
to
run
the
ship
again
and
passengers
refused
to
go
by
it
they
offered
my
abbey
excellent
terms
he
accepted
them
and
very
intelligent
he
was
for
in
spite
of
all
prognostications
nothing
further
happened
to
the
boat
i
had
hitherto
travelled
very
little
and
i
was
wild
with
delight
on
october
at
six
in
the
morning
i
entered
my
cabin
it
was
a
large
one
and
was
hung
with
light
red
repp
embroidered
with
my
initials
what
a
profusion
of
the
letters
then
there
was
a
large
brass
bedstead
brightly
polished
and
flowers
were
everywhere
adjoining
mine
was
a
very
comfortable
cabin
for
petit
and
leading
out
of
that
was
one
for
my
maid
and
her
husband
all
the
other
persons
in
my
service
were
at
the
other
end
of
the
ship
the
sky
was
misty
the
sea
grey
with
no
horizon
i
was
on
my
way
over
there
beyond
that
mist
which
seemed
to
unite
the
sky
and
the
water
in
a
mysterious
rampart
the
clearing
of
the
deck
for
the
departure
upset
every
one
and
everything
the
rumbling
of
the
machinery
the
call
the
bell
the
sobbing
and
the
laughter
the
creaking
of
the
ropes
the
shrill
shouting
of
the
orders
the
terror
of
those
who
were
only
just
in
time
to
catch
the
boat
the
out
of
the
men
who
were
pitching
the
packages
from
the
quay
into
the
hold
the
sound
of
the
laughing
waves
breaking
on
the
side
of
the
boat
all
this
mingled
together
made
the
most
frightful
uproar
tiring
the
brain
so
that
its
own
sensations
were
all
vague
and
bewildered
i
was
one
of
those
who
up
to
the
last
moment
enjoyed
the
the
the
plans
about
the
return
and
the
farewell
kisses
and
when
it
was
all
over
flung
themselves
sobbing
on
their
beds
for
the
next
three
days
i
was
in
utter
despair
weeping
bitter
tears
tears
that
scalded
my
cheeks
then
i
began
to
get
calm
again
my
triumphed
over
my
grief
on
the
fourth
day
i
dressed
at
seven
and
went
on
deck
to
have
some
fresh
air
it
was
icy
cold
and
as
i
walked
up
and
down
i
met
a
lady
dressed
in
black
with
a
sad
resigned
face
the
sea
looked
gloomy
and
colourless
and
there
were
no
waves
suddenly
a
wild
billow
dashed
so
violently
against
the
ship
that
we
were
both
thrown
down
i
immediately
clutched
hold
of
the
leg
of
one
of
the
benches
but
the
unfortunate
lady
was
flung
forward
springing
to
my
feet
with
a
bound
i
was
just
in
time
to
seize
hold
of
the
skirt
of
her
dress
and
with
the
help
of
my
maid
and
a
sailor
managed
to
prevent
the
poor
woman
from
falling
head
first
down
the
staircase
very
much
hurt
though
she
was
and
a
trifle
confused
she
thanked
me
in
such
a
gentle
dreamy
voice
that
my
heart
began
to
beat
with
emotion
might
have
been
killed
madame
i
said
that
horrible
she
answered
with
a
sigh
of
regret
it
was
not
you
not
madame
hessler
she
continued
looking
earnestly
at
me
madame
i
answered
name
is
sarah
she
stepped
back
and
drawing
herself
up
her
face
very
pale
and
her
brows
knitted
she
said
in
a
mournful
voice
a
voice
that
was
scarcely
audible
am
the
widow
of
president
i
too
stepped
back
and
a
thrill
of
anguish
ran
through
me
for
i
had
just
done
this
unhappy
woman
the
only
service
that
i
ought
not
to
have
done
her
i
had
saved
her
from
death
her
husband
had
been
assassinated
by
an
actor
booth
and
it
was
an
actress
who
had
now
prevented
her
from
joining
her
beloved
husband
i
went
back
again
to
my
cabin
and
stayed
there
two
days
for
i
had
not
the
courage
to
meet
the
woman
for
whom
i
felt
such
sympathy
and
to
whom
i
should
never
dare
to
speak
again
on
the
we
were
surprised
by
an
abominable
snowstorm
i
was
called
up
hurriedly
by
captain
jouclas
i
threw
on
a
long
ermine
cloak
and
went
on
to
the
bridge
it
was
perfectly
stupefying
and
at
the
same
time
the
heavy
flakes
met
each
other
with
a
thud
in
their
mad
waltzing
provoked
by
the
wind
the
sky
was
suddenly
veiled
from
us
by
all
this
whiteness
which
fell
round
us
in
avalanches
completely
hiding
the
horizon
i
was
facing
the
sea
and
as
captain
jouclas
pointed
out
to
me
we
could
not
see
a
hundred
yards
in
front
of
us
i
then
turned
round
and
saw
that
the
ship
was
as
white
as
a
the
ropes
the
cordage
the
nettings
the
the
shrouds
the
boats
the
deck
the
sails
the
ladders
the
funnels
the
ventilators
everything
was
white
the
sea
was
black
and
the
sky
black
the
ship
alone
was
white
floating
along
in
this
immensity
there
was
a
contest
between
the
high
funnel
spluttering
forth
with
difficulty
its
smoke
through
the
wind
which
was
rushing
wildly
into
its
great
mouth
and
the
prolonged
shrieks
of
the
siren
the
contrast
was
so
extraordinary
between
the
virgin
whiteness
of
this
ship
and
the
infernal
uproar
it
made
that
it
seemed
to
me
as
if
i
had
before
me
an
angel
in
a
fit
of
hysterics
on
the
evening
of
that
strange
day
the
doctor
came
to
tell
me
of
the
birth
of
a
child
among
the
emigrants
in
whom
i
was
deeply
interested
i
went
at
once
to
the
mother
and
did
all
i
could
for
the
poor
little
creature
who
had
just
come
into
this
world
oh
the
dismal
moans
in
that
dismal
night
in
the
midst
of
all
that
misery
oh
that
first
strident
cry
of
the
child
affirming
its
will
to
live
in
the
midst
of
all
these
sufferings
of
all
these
hardships
and
of
all
these
hopes
everything
was
there
mingled
together
in
this
human
medley
men
women
children
rags
and
preserves
oranges
and
basins
heads
of
hair
and
bald
pates
half
open
lips
of
young
girls
and
tightly
closed
mouths
of
shrewish
women
white
caps
and
red
handkerchiefs
hands
stretched
out
in
hope
and
fists
clenched
against
adversity
i
saw
revolvers
half
concealed
under
the
rags
knives
in
the
belts
a
sudden
roll
of
the
boat
showed
us
the
contents
of
a
parcel
that
had
fallen
from
the
hands
of
a
fellow
with
a
very
determined
expression
on
his
face
and
a
hatchet
and
a
tomahawk
fell
to
the
ground
one
of
the
sailors
immediately
seized
the
two
weapons
to
take
them
to
the
purser
i
shall
never
forget
the
scrutinising
glance
of
the
man
he
had
evidently
made
a
mental
note
of
the
features
of
the
sailor
and
i
breathed
a
fervent
prayer
that
the
two
might
never
meet
in
a
solitary
place
i
remember
now
with
remorse
the
horrible
disgust
that
took
possession
of
me
when
the
doctor
handed
the
child
over
to
me
to
that
dirty
little
red
moving
sticky
object
was
a
human
being
it
had
a
soul
and
would
have
thoughts
i
felt
quite
sick
and
i
could
never
again
look
at
that
child
although
i
was
afterwards
its
godmother
without
living
over
again
that
first
impression
when
the
young
mother
had
fallen
asleep
i
wanted
to
go
back
to
my
cabin
the
doctor
helped
me
but
the
sea
was
so
rough
that
we
could
scarcely
walk
at
all
among
the
packages
and
emigrants
some
of
them
who
were
crouching
on
the
floor
watched
us
silently
as
we
tottered
and
stumbled
along
like
drunkards
i
was
annoyed
at
being
watched
by
those
malevolent
mocking
eyes
say
doctor
one
of
the
men
called
out
sea
water
gets
in
the
head
like
wine
you
and
your
lady
look
as
though
you
were
coming
back
from
a
spree
an
old
woman
clung
to
me
as
we
passed
madame
she
said
we
be
shipwrecked
with
the
boat
rolling
like
this
oh
god
oh
god
a
tall
fellow
with
red
hair
and
beard
came
forward
and
laid
the
poor
old
woman
down
again
gently
can
sleep
in
peace
mother
he
said
we
are
shipwrecked
i
swear
there
shall
be
more
saved
down
here
than
up
he
then
came
closer
to
me
and
continued
in
a
defiant
tone
rich
folks
into
the
sea
the
emigrants
and
the
in
the
boats
as
he
uttered
these
words
i
heard
a
sly
stifled
laugh
from
everywhere
in
front
of
me
behind
at
the
side
and
even
from
under
my
feet
it
seemed
to
echo
in
the
distance
like
the
laughing
behind
the
scenes
on
the
stage
i
drew
nearer
to
the
doctor
and
he
saw
that
i
was
uneasy
he
said
laughing
should
defend
how
many
be
saved
i
asked
case
we
were
really
in
danger
hundred
two
hundred
and
fifty
at
the
most
with
all
the
boats
out
if
all
arrived
the
purser
told
me
that
there
were
seven
hundred
and
sixty
emigrants
i
insisted
there
are
only
a
hundred
and
twenty
passengers
how
many
do
you
reckon
with
the
officers
the
crew
and
the
servants
hundred
and
seventy
the
doctor
answered
there
are
a
thousand
and
fifty
on
board
and
you
can
only
save
two
hundred
and
fifty
then
i
can
understand
the
hatred
of
these
emigrants
whom
you
take
on
board
like
cattle
and
treat
like
negroes
they
are
absolutely
certain
that
in
case
of
danger
they
would
be
sacrificed
we
should
save
them
when
their
turn
i
glanced
with
horror
at
the
man
who
was
talking
to
me
he
looked
honest
and
straightforward
and
he
evidently
meant
what
he
said
and
so
all
these
poor
creatures
who
had
been
disappointed
in
life
and
badly
treated
by
society
would
have
no
right
to
life
until
after
were
saved
we
the
more
favoured
ones
oh
how
i
understood
now
the
fellow
with
his
hatchet
and
tomahawk
how
thoroughly
i
approved
at
that
moment
of
the
revolvers
and
the
knives
hidden
in
the
belts
yes
he
was
quite
right
the
tall
fellow
we
want
the
first
places
always
the
first
places
and
so
we
should
have
the
first
places
in
the
water
are
you
satisfied
asked
the
captain
who
was
just
coming
out
of
his
cabin
it
gone
off
all
right
captain
i
answered
i
am
jouclas
stepped
back
in
surprise
heavens
what
has
horrified
you
he
asked
way
in
which
you
treat
your
passengers
he
tried
to
put
in
a
word
but
i
continued
you
expose
us
in
case
of
a
shipwreck
never
have
a
in
case
of
a
fire
then
never
have
a
fire
in
case
of
sinking
give
in
he
said
laughing
what
do
we
expose
you
though
madame
the
very
worst
of
deaths
to
a
blow
on
the
head
with
an
axe
to
a
dagger
thrust
in
our
back
or
merely
to
be
flung
into
the
water
he
attempted
to
speak
but
again
i
continued
are
seven
hundred
and
fifty
emigrants
below
and
there
are
scarcely
three
hundred
of
us
counting
passengers
and
the
crew
you
have
boats
which
might
save
two
hundred
persons
and
even
that
is
doubtful
what
about
the
emigrants
should
save
them
before
the
after
us
after
you
fancy
that
they
would
let
you
do
it
have
guns
with
which
to
keep
them
in
guns
for
women
and
children
the
women
and
children
would
take
their
turn
that
is
idiotic
i
exclaimed
is
perfectly
absurd
why
save
women
and
children
if
you
are
going
to
make
widows
and
orphans
of
them
and
do
you
believe
that
all
those
young
men
would
resign
themselves
to
their
fate
because
of
your
guns
there
are
more
of
them
than
there
are
of
you
and
they
are
armed
life
owes
them
their
revenge
and
they
have
the
same
right
that
we
have
to
defend
themselves
in
such
moments
they
have
the
courage
of
those
who
have
nothing
to
lose
and
everything
to
gain
in
the
struggle
in
my
opinion
it
is
iniquitous
and
infamous
that
you
should
expose
us
to
certain
death
and
them
to
an
obligatory
and
perfectly
justified
the
captain
tried
to
speak
but
again
i
persisted
going
as
far
as
a
shipwreck
only
fancy
if
we
were
to
be
tossed
about
for
months
on
a
raging
sea
this
has
happened
and
might
happen
again
you
can
not
possibly
have
food
enough
on
board
for
a
thousand
people
during
two
or
three
certainly
not
put
in
the
purser
dryly
he
was
a
very
amiable
man
but
very
touchy
then
what
should
you
do
i
asked
would
do
asked
the
captain
highly
amused
at
the
annoyed
expression
on
the
face
oh
i
should
have
a
ship
for
emigrants
and
a
ship
for
passengers
and
i
think
that
would
be
only
but
it
would
be
the
one
for
wealthy
people
would
be
a
steamer
like
this
and
the
one
for
emigrants
a
sailing
that
too
would
be
unjust
madame
for
the
steamer
would
go
more
quickly
than
the
sailing
would
not
matter
at
all
i
argued
people
are
always
in
a
hurry
and
the
poor
never
are
and
then
considering
what
is
awaiting
them
in
the
land
to
which
they
are
going
is
the
promised
poor
things
poor
things
with
their
promised
land
dakota
or
colorado
in
the
they
have
the
sun
which
makes
their
brains
boil
scorches
the
ground
dries
up
the
springs
and
brings
forth
endless
numbers
of
mosquitoes
to
sting
their
bodies
and
try
their
patience
the
promised
land
at
night
they
have
the
terrible
cold
to
make
their
eyes
smart
to
stiffen
their
joints
and
ruin
their
lungs
the
promised
land
is
just
death
in
some
place
after
fruitless
appeals
to
the
justice
of
their
fellow
countrymen
they
will
breathe
their
life
out
in
a
sob
or
in
a
terrible
curse
of
hatred
god
will
have
mercy
on
them
though
for
it
is
piteous
to
think
that
all
these
poor
creatures
are
delivered
over
with
their
feet
bound
by
suffering
and
their
hands
bound
by
hope
to
the
who
trade
in
white
slaves
and
when
i
think
that
the
money
is
in
the
which
the
has
paid
for
the
transport
of
all
these
poor
creatures
money
that
has
been
collected
by
rough
hands
or
trembling
fingers
poor
money
economised
copper
by
copper
tear
by
tear
when
i
think
of
all
this
it
makes
me
wish
that
we
could
be
shipwrecked
that
could
be
all
killed
and
all
of
them
with
these
words
i
hurried
away
to
my
cabin
to
have
a
good
cry
for
i
was
seized
with
a
great
love
for
humanity
and
intense
grief
that
i
could
do
nothing
absolutely
nothing
the
following
morning
i
woke
late
as
i
had
not
fallen
asleep
until
very
late
my
cabin
was
full
of
visitors
and
they
were
all
holding
small
parcels
half
concealed
i
rubbed
my
sleepy
eyes
and
could
not
quite
understand
the
meaning
of
this
invasion
dear
sarah
said
madame
guérard
coming
to
me
and
kissing
me
imagine
that
this
day
your
day
could
be
forgotten
by
those
who
love
i
exclaimed
it
the
and
here
is
the
first
of
the
remembrances
from
the
absent
my
eyes
filled
with
tears
and
it
was
through
a
mist
that
i
saw
the
portrait
of
that
young
being
more
precious
to
me
than
anything
else
in
the
world
with
a
few
words
in
his
own
handwriting
then
there
were
some
presents
from
friends
pieces
of
work
from
humble
admirers
my
little
godson
of
the
previous
evening
was
brought
to
me
in
a
basket
with
oranges
apples
and
tangerines
all
round
him
he
had
a
golden
star
on
his
forehead
a
star
cut
out
of
some
gold
paper
in
which
chocolate
had
been
wrapped
my
maid
félicie
and
claude
her
husband
who
were
most
devoted
to
me
had
prepared
some
very
ingenious
little
surprises
presently
there
was
a
knock
at
my
door
and
on
my
calling
out
in
i
saw
to
my
surprise
three
sailors
carrying
a
superb
bouquet
which
they
presented
to
me
in
the
name
of
the
whole
crew
i
was
wild
with
admiration
and
wanted
to
know
how
they
had
managed
to
keep
the
flowers
in
such
good
condition
it
was
an
enormous
bouquet
but
when
i
took
it
in
my
hands
i
let
it
fall
to
the
ground
in
an
uncontrollable
fit
of
laughter
the
flowers
were
all
cut
out
of
vegetables
but
so
perfectly
done
that
the
illusion
was
complete
at
a
little
distance
magnificent
roses
were
cut
out
of
carrots
camellias
out
of
turnips
small
radishes
had
furnished
sprays
of
stuck
on
to
long
leeks
dyed
green
and
all
these
relieved
by
carrot
leaves
artistically
arranged
to
imitate
the
grassy
plants
used
for
elegant
bouquets
the
stalks
were
tied
together
with
a
bow
of
ribbon
one
of
the
sailors
made
a
very
touching
little
speech
on
behalf
of
his
comrades
who
wished
to
thank
me
for
a
trifling
service
rendered
i
shook
hands
cordially
and
thanked
them
heartily
and
this
was
the
signal
for
a
little
concert
that
had
been
organised
in
the
cabin
of
petit
there
had
been
a
private
rehearsal
with
two
violins
and
a
flute
so
that
for
the
next
hour
i
was
lulled
by
the
most
delightful
music
which
transported
me
to
my
own
dear
ones
to
my
home
which
seemed
so
distant
from
me
at
that
moment
this
little
which
was
almost
a
domestic
one
together
with
the
music
had
evoked
the
tender
and
restful
side
of
my
life
and
the
tears
that
all
this
called
forth
fell
without
grief
bitterness
or
regret
i
wept
simply
because
i
was
deeply
moved
and
i
was
tired
nervous
and
weary
and
had
a
longing
for
rest
and
peace
i
fell
asleep
in
the
midst
of
my
tears
sighs
and
sobs
xxxiii
arrival
in
new
york
american
reporters
the
custom
house
performances
in
new
york
a
visit
to
edison
at
menlo
park
finally
the
ship
arrived
on
october
at
six
in
the
morning
i
was
asleep
worn
out
by
three
days
and
nights
of
wild
storms
my
maid
had
some
difficulty
in
rousing
me
i
could
not
believe
that
we
had
arrived
and
i
wanted
to
go
on
sleeping
until
the
last
minute
i
had
to
give
in
to
the
evidence
however
as
the
screw
had
stopped
and
i
heard
a
sound
of
dull
thuds
echoing
in
the
distance
i
put
my
head
out
of
my
and
saw
some
men
endeavouring
to
make
a
passage
for
us
through
the
river
the
hudson
was
frozen
hard
and
the
heavy
vessel
could
only
advance
with
the
aid
of
cutting
away
the
blocks
of
ice
this
sudden
arrival
delighted
me
and
everything
seemed
to
be
transformed
in
a
minute
i
forgot
all
my
discomforts
and
the
weariness
of
the
twelve
crossing
the
sun
was
rising
pale
but
dispersing
the
mists
and
shining
over
the
ice
which
thanks
to
the
efforts
of
our
pioneers
was
splintered
into
a
thousand
luminous
pieces
i
had
entered
the
new
world
in
the
midst
of
a
display
of
it
was
and
somewhat
crazy
but
it
seemed
to
me
that
it
must
be
a
good
omen
i
am
so
superstitious
that
if
i
had
arrived
when
there
was
no
sunshine
i
should
have
been
wretched
and
most
anxious
until
after
my
first
performance
it
is
a
perfect
torture
to
be
superstitious
to
this
degree
and
unfortunately
for
me
i
am
ten
times
more
so
now
than
i
was
in
those
days
for
besides
the
superstitions
of
my
own
country
i
have
thanks
to
my
travels
added
to
my
stock
all
the
superstitions
of
the
other
countries
i
know
them
all
now
and
in
any
critical
moment
of
my
life
they
all
rise
up
in
armed
legions
for
or
against
me
i
can
not
walk
a
single
step
or
make
any
movement
or
gesture
sit
down
go
out
look
at
the
sky
or
the
ground
without
finding
some
reason
for
hope
or
for
despair
until
at
last
exasperated
by
the
trammels
put
upon
my
actions
by
my
thought
i
defy
all
my
superstitions
and
just
act
as
i
want
to
act
delighted
then
with
what
seemed
to
me
to
be
a
good
omen
i
began
to
dress
gleefully
jarrett
had
just
knocked
at
my
door
please
be
ready
as
soon
as
possible
madame
he
said
there
are
several
boats
with
the
french
colours
flying
that
have
come
out
to
meet
i
glanced
in
the
direction
of
my
and
saw
a
steamer
the
deck
of
which
was
black
with
people
and
then
two
other
small
boats
no
less
laden
than
the
first
one
the
sun
lighted
up
all
these
french
flags
and
my
heart
began
to
beat
more
quickly
i
had
been
without
any
news
for
twelve
days
as
in
spite
of
all
the
efforts
of
our
good
captain
had
taken
twelve
days
for
the
journey
a
man
had
just
come
on
deck
and
i
rushed
towards
him
with
outstretched
hands
unable
to
utter
a
single
word
he
gave
me
a
packet
of
telegrams
i
did
not
see
any
one
present
and
i
heard
no
sound
i
wanted
to
know
something
and
among
all
the
telegrams
i
was
searching
first
for
one
just
one
name
at
last
i
had
it
the
telegram
i
had
waited
for
feared
and
hoped
to
receive
signed
maurice
here
it
was
at
last
i
closed
my
eyes
for
a
second
and
during
that
time
i
saw
all
that
was
dear
to
me
and
felt
the
infinite
sweetness
of
it
all
when
i
opened
my
eyes
again
i
was
slightly
embarrassed
for
i
was
surrounded
by
a
crowd
of
unknown
people
all
of
them
silent
and
indulgent
but
evidently
very
curious
wishing
to
go
away
i
took
arm
and
went
to
the
saloon
as
soon
as
i
entered
the
first
notes
of
the
marseillaise
rang
out
and
our
consul
spoke
a
few
words
of
welcome
and
handed
me
some
flowers
a
group
representing
the
french
colony
presented
me
with
a
friendly
address
then
mercier
the
editor
of
the
des
etats
made
a
speech
as
witty
as
it
was
kindly
it
was
a
thoroughly
french
speech
then
came
the
terrible
moment
of
introductions
oh
what
a
tiring
time
that
was
my
mind
was
kept
at
a
tension
to
catch
the
names
pemb
madame
harth
with
the
aspirated
with
great
difficulty
i
grasped
the
first
syllable
and
the
second
finished
in
a
confusion
of
muffled
vowels
and
hissing
consonants
by
the
time
the
twentieth
name
was
pronounced
i
had
given
up
listening
i
simply
kept
on
with
my
little
de
half
closed
my
eyes
held
out
mechanically
the
arm
at
the
end
of
which
was
the
hand
that
had
to
shake
and
be
shaken
i
replied
all
the
time
je
suis
charmée
madame
oh
certainement
oh
oui
oh
non
ah
oh
oh
i
was
getting
dazed
idiotic
worn
out
with
standing
i
had
only
one
idea
and
that
was
to
get
my
rings
off
the
fingers
that
were
swelling
with
the
repeated
grips
they
were
enduring
my
eyes
were
getting
larger
and
larger
with
terror
as
they
gazed
at
the
door
through
which
the
crowd
continued
to
stream
in
my
direction
there
were
still
the
names
of
all
these
people
to
hear
and
all
these
hands
to
shake
my
de
must
still
go
on
working
more
than
fifty
times
i
could
feel
the
beads
of
perspiration
standing
out
under
my
hair
and
i
began
to
get
terribly
nervous
my
teeth
chattered
and
i
commenced
stammering
madame
oh
je
suis
cha
cha
i
really
could
not
go
on
any
longer
i
felt
that
i
should
get
angry
or
burst
out
crying
in
fact
that
i
was
about
to
make
myself
ridiculous
i
decided
therefore
to
faint
i
made
a
movement
with
my
hand
as
though
it
wanted
to
continue
but
could
not
i
opened
my
mouth
closed
my
eyes
and
fell
gently
into
arms
air
a
doctor
poor
thing
how
pale
she
is
take
her
hat
off
loosen
her
corset
she
wear
one
unfasten
her
dress
i
was
terrified
but
félicie
was
called
up
in
haste
and
petit
would
not
allow
any
the
doctor
came
back
with
a
bottle
of
ether
félicie
seized
the
bottle
no
doctor
not
ether
when
madame
is
quite
well
the
odour
of
ether
will
make
her
this
was
quite
true
and
i
thought
it
was
time
to
come
to
my
senses
again
the
reporters
were
arriving
and
there
were
more
than
twenty
of
them
but
jarrett
who
was
very
much
affected
asked
them
to
go
to
the
albemarle
hotel
where
i
was
to
put
up
i
saw
each
of
the
reporters
take
jarrett
aside
and
when
i
asked
him
what
the
secret
was
of
all
these
he
answered
phlegmatically
have
made
an
appointment
with
them
for
one
there
will
be
a
fresh
one
every
ten
i
looked
at
him
petrified
with
astonishment
he
met
my
anxious
gaze
and
said
oui
il
était
on
arriving
at
the
albemarle
hotel
i
felt
tired
and
nervous
and
wanted
to
be
left
quite
alone
i
hurried
away
at
once
to
my
room
in
the
suite
that
had
been
engaged
for
me
and
fastened
the
doors
there
was
neither
lock
nor
bolt
on
one
of
them
but
i
pushed
a
piece
of
furniture
against
it
and
then
refused
emphatically
to
open
it
there
were
about
fifty
people
waiting
in
the
but
i
had
that
feeling
of
awful
weariness
which
makes
one
ready
to
go
to
the
most
violent
extremes
for
the
sake
of
an
repose
i
wanted
to
lie
down
on
the
rug
cross
my
arms
throw
my
head
back
and
close
my
eyes
i
did
not
want
to
talk
any
more
and
i
did
not
want
to
have
to
smile
or
look
at
any
one
i
threw
myself
down
on
the
floor
and
was
deaf
to
the
knocks
on
my
door
and
to
supplications
i
did
not
want
to
argue
the
matter
so
i
did
not
utter
a
word
i
heard
the
murmur
of
grumbling
voices
and
words
tactfully
persuading
the
visitors
to
stay
i
heard
the
rustle
of
paper
being
pushed
under
the
door
and
madame
guérard
whispering
to
jarrett
who
was
furious
know
her
monsieur
jarrett
i
heard
her
say
she
thought
you
were
forcing
the
door
open
against
which
she
has
pushed
the
furniture
she
would
jump
out
of
the
window
then
i
heard
félicie
talking
to
a
french
lady
who
was
insisting
on
seeing
me
is
quite
impossible
she
was
saying
would
be
quite
hysterical
she
needs
an
rest
and
every
one
must
wait
for
some
little
time
i
could
hear
a
confused
murmur
which
seemed
to
get
farther
away
and
then
i
fell
into
a
delicious
sleep
laughing
to
myself
as
i
went
off
for
my
good
temper
returned
as
i
pictured
the
angry
nonplussed
expression
on
the
faces
of
my
visitors
i
woke
in
an
time
for
i
have
the
precious
gift
of
being
able
to
sleep
ten
minutes
a
quarter
of
an
hour
or
an
hour
just
as
i
like
and
i
then
wake
up
quite
peacefully
without
a
shake
at
the
time
i
choose
to
rouse
up
nothing
does
me
so
much
good
as
this
rest
to
body
and
mind
decided
upon
and
regulated
merely
by
my
will
very
often
when
among
my
intimate
friends
i
have
lain
down
on
the
in
front
of
the
fire
telling
every
one
to
go
on
talking
and
to
take
no
notice
of
me
i
have
then
slept
perhaps
for
an
hour
and
on
waking
have
found
two
or
three
in
the
room
who
not
wishing
to
disturb
me
have
taken
part
in
the
general
conversation
whilst
waiting
until
i
should
wake
up
and
they
could
present
their
respects
to
me
even
now
i
lie
down
on
the
huge
wide
sofa
in
the
little
empire
which
leads
into
my
and
i
sleep
whilst
waiting
for
the
friends
and
artistes
with
whom
i
have
made
appointments
to
be
ushered
in
when
i
open
my
eyes
i
see
the
faces
of
my
kind
friends
who
shake
hands
cordially
delighted
that
i
should
have
had
some
rest
my
mind
is
then
tranquil
and
i
am
ready
to
listen
to
all
the
beautiful
ideas
proposed
to
me
or
to
decline
the
absurdities
submitted
to
me
without
being
ungracious
i
woke
up
then
at
the
albemarle
hotel
an
hour
later
and
found
myself
lying
on
the
rug
i
opened
the
door
of
my
room
and
discovered
my
dear
guérard
and
my
faithful
félicie
seated
on
a
trunk
there
any
people
there
still
i
asked
madame
there
are
about
a
hundred
now
answered
félicie
me
to
take
my
things
off
then
quickly
i
said
find
me
a
white
in
about
five
minutes
i
was
ready
and
i
felt
that
i
looked
nice
from
head
to
foot
i
went
into
the
where
all
these
unknown
persons
were
waiting
jarrett
came
forward
to
meet
me
but
on
seeing
me
well
dressed
and
with
a
smiling
face
he
postponed
the
sermon
that
he
wanted
to
preach
to
me
i
should
like
to
introduce
jarrett
to
my
readers
for
he
was
a
most
extraordinary
man
he
was
then
about
or
seventy
years
of
age
he
was
tall
with
a
face
like
king
agamemnon
framed
by
the
most
beautiful
hair
i
have
ever
seen
on
a
head
his
eyes
were
of
so
pale
a
blue
that
when
they
lighted
up
with
anger
he
looked
as
though
he
were
blind
when
he
was
calm
and
tranquil
admiring
nature
his
face
was
really
handsome
but
when
gay
and
animated
his
upper
lip
showed
his
teeth
and
curled
up
in
a
most
ferocious
sniff
and
his
grins
seemed
to
be
caused
by
the
drawing
up
of
his
pointed
ears
which
were
always
moving
as
though
on
the
watch
for
prey
he
was
a
terrible
man
extremely
intelligent
but
from
childhood
he
must
have
been
fighting
with
the
world
and
he
had
the
most
profound
contempt
for
all
mankind
although
he
must
have
suffered
a
great
deal
himself
he
had
no
pity
for
others
who
suffered
he
always
said
that
every
man
was
armed
for
his
own
defence
he
pitied
women
did
not
care
for
them
but
was
always
ready
to
help
them
he
was
very
rich
and
very
economical
but
not
miserly
made
my
way
in
life
he
often
said
to
me
the
aid
of
two
weapons
honesty
and
a
revolver
in
business
honesty
is
the
most
terrible
weapon
a
man
can
use
against
rascals
and
crafty
people
the
former
know
what
it
is
and
the
latter
believe
in
it
while
the
revolver
is
an
admirable
invention
for
compelling
scoundrels
to
keep
their
he
used
to
tell
me
about
wonderful
and
terrifying
adventures
he
had
a
deep
scar
under
his
right
eye
during
a
violent
discussion
about
a
contract
to
be
signed
for
jenny
lind
the
celebrated
singer
jarrett
said
to
his
interlocutor
pointing
at
the
same
time
to
his
right
eye
at
that
eye
sir
it
is
now
reading
in
your
mind
all
that
you
are
not
know
how
to
read
then
for
it
never
foresaw
that
said
the
other
firing
his
revolver
at
right
eye
bad
shot
sir
replied
jarrett
is
the
way
to
take
aim
for
effectually
closing
an
and
he
put
a
ball
between
the
two
eyes
of
the
other
man
who
fell
down
dead
when
jarrett
told
this
story
his
lip
curled
up
and
his
two
incisors
appeared
to
be
crunching
the
words
with
delight
and
his
bursts
of
stifled
laughter
sounded
like
the
snapping
of
his
jaws
he
was
an
upright
honest
man
though
and
i
liked
him
very
much
and
i
like
what
i
remember
of
him
my
first
impression
was
a
joyful
one
and
i
clapped
my
hands
with
delight
as
i
entered
the
which
i
had
not
yet
seen
the
busts
of
racine
molière
and
victor
hugo
were
on
pedestals
surrounded
with
flowers
all
round
the
large
room
were
sofas
laden
with
cushions
and
to
remind
me
of
my
home
in
paris
there
were
tall
palms
stretching
out
their
branches
over
the
sofas
jarrett
introduced
knoedler
who
had
suggested
this
piece
of
gallantry
he
was
a
very
charming
man
i
shook
hands
with
him
and
we
were
friends
from
that
time
forth
the
visitors
soon
went
away
but
the
reporters
remained
they
were
all
seated
some
of
them
on
the
arms
of
the
chairs
others
on
the
cushions
one
of
them
had
crouched
down
on
a
and
was
leaning
back
against
the
steam
heater
he
was
pale
and
thin
and
coughed
a
great
deal
i
went
towards
him
and
had
just
opened
my
lips
to
speak
to
him
although
i
was
rather
shocked
that
he
did
not
rise
when
he
addressed
me
in
a
bass
voice
is
your
favourite
madame
he
asked
is
no
concern
of
yours
i
answered
turning
my
back
on
him
in
doing
so
i
knocked
against
another
reporter
who
was
more
polite
do
you
eat
when
you
wake
in
the
morning
madame
he
inquired
i
was
about
to
reply
to
him
as
i
had
done
to
the
first
one
but
jarrett
who
had
had
difficulty
in
appeasing
the
anger
of
the
crouching
man
answered
quickly
for
me
i
did
not
know
what
that
dish
was
but
the
ferocious
reporter
continued
his
questions
what
do
you
eat
during
the
day
he
wrote
down
phlegmatically
during
the
i
moved
towards
the
door
and
a
female
reporter
in
a
skirt
with
her
hair
cut
short
asked
me
in
a
clear
sweet
voice
you
a
i
stood
still
rooted
to
the
spot
in
bewilderment
she
had
said
all
that
in
a
breath
accenting
the
syllables
haphazard
and
making
of
the
whole
one
word
so
wildly
incoherent
that
my
impression
was
that
i
was
not
in
safety
near
this
strange
gentle
person
i
must
have
looked
uneasy
and
as
my
eyes
fell
on
an
elderly
lady
who
was
talking
gaily
to
a
little
group
of
people
she
came
to
my
rescue
saying
in
very
good
french
young
lady
is
asking
you
madame
whether
you
are
of
the
jewish
religion
or
whether
you
are
a
catholic
a
protestant
a
mohammedan
a
buddhist
an
atheist
a
zoroastrian
a
theist
or
a
i
sank
down
on
a
couch
heavens
i
exclaimed
it
be
like
this
in
all
the
cities
i
visit
no
answered
jarrett
placidly
interviews
will
be
wired
throughout
about
the
mussels
i
thought
to
myself
and
then
in
an
way
i
answered
am
a
catholic
roman
catholic
or
do
you
belong
to
the
orthodox
church
she
asked
i
jumped
up
from
my
seat
for
she
bored
me
beyond
endurance
and
a
very
young
man
then
approached
timidly
you
allow
me
to
finish
my
sketch
madame
he
asked
i
remained
standing
my
profile
turned
towards
him
at
his
request
when
he
had
finished
i
asked
to
see
what
he
had
done
and
perfectly
unabashed
he
handed
me
his
horrible
drawing
of
a
skeleton
with
a
curly
wig
i
tore
the
sketch
up
and
threw
it
at
him
but
the
following
day
that
horror
appeared
in
the
papers
with
a
disagreeable
inscription
beneath
it
fortunately
i
was
able
to
speak
seriously
about
my
art
with
a
few
honest
and
intelligent
journalists
but
years
ago
paragraphs
were
more
appreciated
in
america
than
serious
articles
and
the
public
very
much
less
literary
then
than
at
present
always
seemed
ready
to
echo
the
turpitudes
invented
by
reporters
hard
up
for
copy
i
should
think
that
no
creature
in
the
world
since
the
invention
of
reporting
has
ever
had
as
much
to
endure
as
i
had
during
that
first
tour
the
basest
calumnies
were
circulated
by
my
enemies
long
before
i
arrived
in
america
there
was
all
the
treachery
of
the
friends
of
the
comédie
and
even
of
my
own
admirers
who
hoped
that
i
should
not
succeed
on
my
tour
so
that
i
might
return
more
quickly
to
the
fold
humiliated
calmed
down
and
subdued
then
there
were
the
exaggerated
announcements
invented
by
my
abbey
and
my
representative
jarrett
these
announcements
were
often
outrageous
and
always
ridiculous
but
i
did
not
know
their
real
source
until
long
afterwards
when
it
was
too
late
much
too
late
to
undeceive
the
public
who
were
fully
persuaded
that
i
was
the
instigator
of
all
these
inventions
i
therefore
did
not
attempt
to
undeceive
them
it
matters
very
little
to
me
whether
people
believe
one
thing
or
another
life
is
short
even
for
those
who
live
a
long
time
and
we
must
live
for
the
few
who
know
and
appreciate
us
who
judge
and
absolve
us
and
for
whom
we
have
the
same
affection
and
indulgence
the
rest
i
look
upon
as
a
mere
crowd
lively
or
sad
loyal
or
corrupt
from
whom
there
is
nothing
to
be
expected
but
fleeting
emotions
either
pleasant
or
unpleasant
which
leave
no
trace
behind
them
we
ought
to
hate
very
rarely
as
it
is
too
fatiguing
remain
indifferent
to
a
great
deal
forgive
often
and
never
forget
forgiving
does
not
mean
forgetting
at
least
it
does
not
with
me
i
will
not
mention
here
any
of
the
outrageous
and
infamous
attacks
that
were
made
upon
me
as
it
would
be
doing
too
great
an
honour
to
the
wretched
people
who
were
responsible
for
them
from
beginning
to
end
dipping
their
pen
in
the
gall
of
their
own
souls
all
i
can
say
is
that
nothing
kills
but
death
and
that
any
one
who
wishes
to
defend
himself
or
herself
from
slander
can
do
it
for
that
one
must
live
it
is
not
given
to
every
one
to
be
able
to
do
it
but
it
depends
on
the
will
of
god
who
sees
and
judges
i
took
two
rest
before
going
to
the
theatre
for
i
could
feel
the
movement
of
the
ship
all
the
time
my
head
was
dizzy
and
it
seemed
to
me
as
though
the
ceiling
moved
up
and
down
the
twelve
days
on
the
sea
had
quite
upset
my
health
i
sent
a
line
to
the
stage
manager
telling
him
that
we
would
rehearse
on
wednesday
and
on
that
day
as
soon
as
luncheon
was
over
i
went
to
theatre
where
our
performances
were
to
take
place
at
the
i
saw
a
compact
swaying
crowd
very
much
animated
and
gesticulating
these
individuals
did
not
belong
to
the
world
of
actors
they
were
not
reporters
either
for
i
knew
them
too
well
alas
to
be
mistaken
in
them
they
were
not
there
out
of
curiosity
either
these
people
for
they
seemed
too
much
occupied
and
then
too
there
were
only
men
when
my
carriage
drew
up
one
of
them
rushed
forward
to
the
door
of
it
and
then
returned
to
the
swaying
crowd
she
is
here
she
is
i
heard
and
then
all
these
common
men
with
their
white
neckties
and
hands
with
their
coats
flying
open
and
trousers
the
knees
of
which
were
worn
and
crowded
behind
me
into
the
narrow
passage
leading
to
the
staircase
i
did
not
feel
very
easy
in
my
mind
and
i
mounted
the
stairs
rapidly
several
persons
were
waiting
for
me
at
the
top
abbey
jarrett
and
also
some
reporters
two
gentlemen
and
a
charming
and
most
distinguished
woman
whose
friendship
i
have
kept
ever
since
although
she
does
not
care
much
for
french
people
i
saw
abbey
who
was
usually
very
dignified
and
cold
advance
in
the
most
gracious
and
courteous
way
to
one
of
the
men
who
were
following
me
they
raised
their
hats
to
each
other
and
followed
by
the
strange
and
regiment
they
advanced
towards
the
centre
of
the
stage
i
then
saw
the
strangest
of
sights
in
the
middle
of
the
stage
were
my
trunks
in
obedience
to
a
sign
twenty
of
the
men
came
forward
and
placing
themselves
each
one
between
two
trunks
with
a
quick
movement
with
their
right
and
left
hands
they
took
the
covers
off
the
trunks
on
the
right
and
left
of
them
jarrett
with
frowns
and
an
unpleasant
grin
held
out
my
keys
to
them
he
had
asked
me
that
morning
for
my
keys
for
the
customs
nothing
he
said
be
uneasy
and
the
way
in
which
my
luggage
had
always
been
respected
in
other
countries
had
given
me
perfect
confidence
about
it
the
principal
personage
of
the
ugly
group
came
towards
me
accompanied
by
abbey
and
jarrett
explained
things
to
me
the
man
was
an
official
from
the
american
the
is
an
abominable
institution
in
every
country
but
worse
in
america
than
anywhere
else
i
was
prepared
for
all
this
and
was
most
affable
to
the
tormentor
of
a
patience
he
raised
the
melon
which
served
him
for
a
hat
and
without
taking
his
cigar
out
of
his
mouth
made
some
incomprehensible
remark
to
me
he
then
turned
to
his
regiment
of
men
made
an
abrupt
sign
with
his
hand
and
uttered
some
word
of
command
whereupon
the
forty
dirty
hands
of
these
twenty
men
proceeded
to
forage
among
my
velvets
satins
and
laces
i
rushed
forward
to
save
my
poor
dresses
from
such
outrageous
violation
and
i
ordered
the
lady
of
our
company
who
had
charge
of
the
costumes
to
lift
my
gowns
out
one
at
a
time
which
she
accordingly
did
aided
by
my
maid
who
was
in
tears
at
the
small
amount
of
respect
shown
by
these
boors
to
all
my
beautiful
fragile
things
two
ladies
had
just
arrived
very
noisy
and
businesslike
one
of
them
was
short
and
stout
her
nose
seemed
to
begin
at
the
roots
of
her
hair
she
had
round
eyes
and
a
mouth
like
a
snout
her
arms
she
was
hiding
timidly
behind
her
heavy
flabby
bust
and
her
ungainly
knees
seemed
to
come
straight
out
of
her
groin
she
looked
like
a
seated
cow
her
companion
was
like
a
terrapin
with
her
little
black
head
at
the
end
of
a
neck
which
was
too
long
and
very
stringy
she
kept
shooting
it
out
of
her
boa
and
drawing
it
back
with
the
most
incredible
rapidity
the
rest
of
her
body
bulged
out
flat
these
two
delightful
persons
were
the
dressmakers
sent
for
by
the
to
value
my
costumes
they
glanced
at
me
in
a
furtive
way
and
gave
a
little
bow
full
of
bitterness
and
jealous
rage
at
the
sight
of
my
dresses
and
i
was
quite
aware
that
two
more
enemies
had
now
come
upon
the
scene
these
two
odious
shrews
began
to
chatter
and
argue
pawing
and
crumpling
my
dresses
and
cloaks
at
the
same
time
they
kept
exclaiming
in
the
most
emphatic
way
how
beautiful
what
magnificence
what
luxury
all
our
customers
will
want
gowns
like
these
and
we
shall
never
be
able
to
make
them
it
will
be
the
ruin
of
all
the
american
they
were
working
up
the
judges
into
a
state
of
excitement
for
this
chiffon
they
kept
lamenting
then
going
into
raptures
and
asking
for
against
foreign
invasion
the
ugly
band
of
men
nodded
their
heads
in
approval
and
spat
on
the
ground
to
affirm
their
independence
suddenly
the
terrapin
turned
on
one
of
the
inquisitors
it
beautiful
show
it
show
it
she
exclaimed
seizing
on
a
dress
all
embroidered
with
pearls
which
i
wore
in
dame
aux
dress
is
worth
at
least
dollars
she
said
and
then
coming
up
to
me
she
asked
much
did
you
pay
for
that
dress
madame
i
ground
my
teeth
together
and
would
not
answer
for
just
at
that
moment
i
should
have
enjoyed
seeing
the
terrapin
in
one
of
the
saucepans
in
the
albemarle
hotel
kitchen
it
was
nearly
five
and
my
feet
were
frozen
i
was
half
dead
too
with
fatigue
and
suppressed
anger
the
rest
of
the
examination
was
postponed
until
the
next
day
and
the
ugly
band
of
men
offered
to
put
everything
back
in
the
trunks
but
i
objected
to
that
i
sent
out
for
five
hundred
yards
of
blue
tarletan
to
cover
over
the
mountain
of
dresses
hats
cloaks
shoes
laces
linen
stockings
furs
gloves
they
then
made
me
take
my
oath
to
remove
nothing
for
they
had
such
charming
confidence
in
me
and
i
left
my
steward
there
in
charge
he
was
the
husband
of
félicie
my
maid
and
a
bed
was
put
up
for
him
on
the
stage
i
was
so
nervous
and
upset
that
i
wanted
to
go
somewhere
far
away
to
have
some
fresh
air
and
to
stay
out
for
a
long
time
a
friend
offered
to
take
me
to
see
brooklyn
bridge
masterpiece
of
american
genius
will
make
you
forget
the
petty
miseries
of
our
red
tape
affairs
he
said
gently
and
so
we
set
out
for
brooklyn
bridge
oh
that
bridge
it
is
insane
admirable
imposing
and
it
makes
one
feel
proud
yes
one
is
proud
to
be
a
human
being
when
one
realises
that
a
brain
has
created
and
suspended
in
the
air
fifty
yards
from
the
ground
that
fearful
thing
which
bears
a
dozen
trains
filled
with
passengers
ten
or
twelve
tramcars
a
hundred
cabs
carriages
and
carts
and
thousands
of
foot
passengers
and
all
that
moving
along
together
amidst
the
uproar
of
the
music
of
the
metals
clanging
clashing
grating
and
groaning
under
the
enormous
weight
of
people
and
things
the
movement
of
the
air
caused
by
this
frightful
tempestuous
coming
and
going
caused
me
to
feel
giddy
and
stopped
my
breath
i
made
a
sign
for
the
carriage
to
stand
still
and
i
closed
my
eyes
i
then
had
a
strange
undefinable
sensation
of
universal
chaos
i
opened
my
eyes
again
when
my
brain
was
a
little
more
tranquil
and
i
saw
new
york
stretching
out
along
the
river
wearing
its
night
ornaments
which
glittered
as
much
through
its
dress
with
thousands
of
electric
lights
as
the
firmament
with
its
tunic
of
stars
i
returned
to
the
hotel
reconciled
with
this
great
nation
i
went
to
sleep
tired
in
body
but
rested
in
mind
and
had
such
delightful
dreams
that
i
was
in
a
good
humour
the
following
day
i
adore
dreams
and
my
sad
unhappy
days
are
those
which
follow
dreamless
nights
my
great
grief
is
that
i
can
not
choose
my
dreams
how
many
times
i
have
done
all
in
my
power
at
the
end
of
a
happy
day
to
make
myself
dream
a
continuation
of
it
how
many
times
i
have
called
up
the
faces
of
those
i
love
just
before
falling
asleep
but
my
thoughts
wander
and
carry
me
off
elsewhere
and
i
prefer
that
a
hundred
times
over
to
the
absolute
negation
of
thought
when
i
am
asleep
my
body
has
an
infinite
sense
of
enjoyment
but
it
is
torture
to
me
for
my
thoughts
to
slumber
my
vital
forces
rebel
against
such
negation
of
life
i
am
quite
willing
to
die
once
for
all
but
i
object
to
slight
deaths
such
as
those
of
which
one
has
the
sensation
on
dreamless
nights
when
i
awoke
my
maid
told
me
that
jarrett
was
waiting
for
me
to
go
to
the
theatre
so
that
the
valuation
of
my
costumes
could
be
terminated
i
sent
word
to
jarrett
that
i
had
seen
quite
enough
of
the
regiment
from
the
and
i
asked
him
to
finish
everything
without
me
as
madame
guérard
would
be
there
during
the
next
two
days
the
terrapin
the
seated
cow
and
the
black
band
made
notes
for
the
took
sketches
for
the
papers
and
patterns
of
my
dresses
for
customers
i
began
to
get
impatient
as
we
ought
to
have
been
rehearsing
finally
i
was
told
on
thursday
morning
that
the
business
was
over
and
that
i
could
not
have
my
trunks
until
i
had
paid
thousand
francs
for
duty
i
was
seized
with
such
a
violent
fit
of
laughing
that
poor
abbey
who
had
been
terrified
caught
it
from
me
and
even
jarrett
showed
his
cruel
teeth
dear
abbey
i
exclaimed
as
you
like
about
it
but
i
must
make
my
on
monday
the
of
november
and
is
thursday
i
shall
be
at
the
theatre
on
monday
to
dress
see
that
i
have
my
trunks
for
there
was
nothing
about
the
in
my
contract
i
will
pay
half
though
of
what
you
have
to
the
thousand
francs
were
handed
over
to
an
attorney
who
made
a
claim
in
my
name
on
the
board
of
customs
my
trunks
were
left
with
me
thanks
to
this
payment
and
the
rehearsals
commenced
at
theatre
on
monday
november
at
the
curtain
rose
for
the
first
performance
of
the
house
was
crowded
and
the
seats
which
had
been
sold
to
the
highest
bidders
and
then
sold
by
them
again
had
fetched
exorbitant
prices
i
was
awaited
with
impatience
and
curiosity
but
not
with
any
sympathy
there
were
no
young
girls
present
as
the
piece
was
too
immoral
poor
adrienne
lecouvreur
the
audience
was
very
polite
to
the
artistes
of
my
company
but
rather
impatient
to
see
the
strange
person
who
had
been
described
to
them
in
the
play
the
curtain
falls
at
the
end
of
the
first
act
without
adrienne
having
appeared
a
person
in
the
house
very
much
annoyed
asked
to
see
henry
abbey
want
my
money
back
he
said
la
bernhardt
is
not
in
every
abbey
refused
to
return
the
money
to
the
extraordinary
individual
and
as
the
curtain
was
going
up
he
hurried
back
to
take
possession
of
his
seat
again
my
appearance
was
greeted
by
several
rounds
of
applause
which
i
believe
had
been
paid
for
in
advance
by
abbey
and
jarrett
i
commenced
and
the
sweetness
of
my
voice
in
the
fable
of
the
worked
the
miracle
the
whole
house
this
time
burst
out
into
hurrahs
a
current
of
sympathy
was
established
between
the
public
and
myself
instead
of
the
hysterical
skeleton
that
had
been
announced
to
them
they
had
before
them
a
very
creature
with
a
sweet
voice
the
fourth
act
was
applauded
and
rebellion
against
the
princesse
de
bouillon
stirred
the
whole
house
finally
in
the
fifth
act
when
the
unfortunate
artiste
is
dying
poisoned
by
her
rival
there
was
quite
a
manifestation
and
every
one
was
deeply
moved
at
the
end
of
the
third
act
all
the
young
men
were
sent
off
by
the
ladies
to
find
all
the
musicians
they
could
get
together
and
to
my
surprise
and
delight
on
arriving
at
my
hotel
a
charming
serenade
was
played
for
me
while
i
was
at
supper
the
crowd
had
assembled
under
my
windows
at
the
albemarle
hotel
and
i
was
obliged
to
go
out
on
to
the
balcony
several
times
to
bow
and
to
thank
this
public
which
i
had
been
told
i
should
find
cold
and
prejudiced
against
me
from
the
bottom
of
my
heart
i
also
thanked
all
my
detractors
and
slanderers
as
it
was
through
them
that
i
had
had
the
pleasure
of
fighting
with
the
certainty
of
conquering
the
victory
was
all
the
more
enjoyable
as
i
had
not
dared
to
hope
for
it
i
gave
performances
in
new
york
the
plays
were
dame
aux
and
the
average
receipts
were
francs
for
each
performance
including
the
last
performance
was
given
on
saturday
december
as
a
for
my
company
had
to
leave
that
night
for
boston
and
i
had
reserved
the
evening
to
go
to
at
menlo
park
where
i
had
a
reception
worthy
of
fairyland
oh
that
of
saturday
december
i
can
never
forget
it
when
i
got
to
the
theatre
to
dress
it
was
for
the
was
to
commence
at
one
my
carriage
stopped
not
being
able
to
get
along
for
the
street
was
filled
by
ladies
sitting
on
chairs
which
they
had
borrowed
from
the
neighbouring
shops
or
on
folding
seats
which
they
had
brought
themselves
the
play
was
dame
aux
i
had
to
get
out
of
my
carriage
and
walk
about
yards
on
foot
in
order
to
get
to
the
stage
door
it
took
me
minutes
to
do
it
people
shook
my
hands
and
begged
me
to
come
back
one
lady
took
off
her
brooch
and
pinned
it
in
my
mantle
a
modest
brooch
of
amethysts
surrounded
by
fine
pearls
but
certainly
for
the
giver
the
brooch
had
its
value
i
was
stopped
at
every
step
one
lady
pulled
out
her
and
begged
me
to
write
my
name
the
idea
took
like
lightning
small
boys
under
the
care
of
their
parents
wanted
me
to
write
my
name
on
their
cuffs
my
arms
were
full
of
small
bouquets
which
had
been
pushed
into
my
hands
i
felt
behind
me
some
one
tugging
at
the
feather
in
my
hat
i
turned
round
sharply
a
woman
with
a
pair
of
scissors
in
her
hand
had
tried
to
cut
off
a
lock
of
my
hair
but
she
only
succeeded
in
cutting
the
feather
out
of
my
hat
in
vain
jarrett
signalled
and
shouted
i
could
not
get
along
they
sent
for
the
police
who
delivered
me
but
without
any
ceremony
either
for
my
admirers
or
for
myself
those
policemen
were
real
brutes
and
they
made
me
very
angry
i
played
dame
aux
and
i
counted
seventeen
calls
after
the
third
act
and
after
the
fifth
in
consequence
of
the
cheering
and
calls
the
play
had
lasted
an
hour
longer
than
usual
and
i
was
half
dead
with
fatigue
i
was
just
about
to
go
to
my
carriage
to
get
back
to
my
hotel
when
jarrett
came
to
tell
me
that
there
were
more
than
people
waiting
outside
i
fell
back
on
a
chair
tired
and
disheartened
i
will
wait
till
the
crowd
has
dispersed
i
am
tired
out
i
can
do
no
but
henry
abbey
had
an
inspiration
of
genius
said
he
to
my
sister
on
hat
and
boa
and
take
my
arm
and
take
also
these
bouquets
give
me
what
you
can
not
carry
and
now
we
will
go
to
your
carriage
and
make
our
he
said
all
this
in
english
and
jarrett
translated
it
to
my
sister
who
willingly
accepted
her
part
in
this
little
comedy
during
this
time
jarrett
and
i
got
into
carriage
which
was
stationed
in
front
of
the
theatre
where
no
one
was
waiting
and
it
was
fortunate
we
took
this
course
for
my
sister
only
got
back
to
the
albemarle
hotel
an
hour
later
very
tired
but
very
much
amused
her
resemblance
to
myself
my
hat
my
boa
and
the
darkness
of
night
had
been
the
accomplices
of
the
little
comedy
which
we
had
offered
to
my
enthusiastic
public
we
had
to
set
out
at
nine
for
menlo
park
we
had
to
dress
in
travelling
costume
for
the
following
day
we
were
to
leave
for
boston
and
my
trunks
were
leaving
the
same
day
with
my
company
which
preceded
me
by
several
hours
our
meal
was
as
usual
very
bad
for
in
those
days
in
america
the
food
was
unspeakably
awful
at
ten
we
took
the
train
a
pretty
special
train
all
decorated
with
flowers
and
banners
which
they
had
been
kind
enough
to
prepare
for
me
but
it
was
a
painful
journey
all
the
same
for
at
every
moment
we
had
to
pull
up
to
allow
another
train
to
pass
or
an
engine
to
manoeuvre
or
to
wait
to
pass
over
the
points
it
was
two
in
the
morning
when
the
train
at
last
reached
the
station
of
menlo
park
the
residence
of
thomas
edison
it
was
a
very
dark
night
and
the
snow
was
falling
silently
in
heavy
flakes
a
carriage
was
waiting
and
the
one
lamp
of
this
carriage
served
to
light
up
the
whole
station
for
orders
had
been
given
that
the
electric
lights
should
be
put
out
i
found
my
way
with
the
help
of
jarrett
and
some
of
my
friends
who
had
accompanied
us
from
new
york
the
intense
cold
froze
the
snow
as
it
fell
and
we
walked
over
veritable
blocks
of
sharp
jagged
ice
which
crackled
under
our
feet
behind
the
first
carriage
was
another
heavier
one
with
only
one
horse
and
no
lamp
there
was
room
for
five
or
six
persons
to
crowd
into
this
we
were
ten
in
all
jarrett
abbey
my
sister
and
i
took
our
places
in
the
first
one
leaving
the
others
to
get
into
the
second
we
looked
like
a
band
of
conspirators
the
dark
night
the
two
mysterious
carriages
the
silence
caused
by
the
icy
coldness
the
way
in
which
we
were
muffled
in
our
furs
and
our
anxious
expression
as
we
glanced
around
us
all
this
made
our
visit
to
the
celebrated
edison
resemble
a
scene
out
of
an
operetta
the
carriage
rolled
along
sinking
deep
into
the
snow
and
jolting
terribly
the
jolts
made
us
dread
every
instant
some
accident
i
can
not
tell
how
long
we
had
been
rolling
along
for
lulled
by
the
movement
of
the
carriage
and
buried
in
my
warm
furs
i
was
quietly
dozing
when
a
formidable
hip
hurrah
made
us
all
jump
my
travelling
companions
the
coachman
the
horse
and
i
as
quick
as
thought
the
whole
country
was
suddenly
illuminated
under
the
trees
on
the
trees
among
the
bushes
along
the
garden
walks
lights
flashed
forth
triumphantly
the
wheels
of
the
carriage
turned
a
few
more
times
and
then
drew
up
at
the
house
of
the
famous
thomas
edison
a
group
of
people
awaited
us
on
the
verandah
four
men
two
ladies
and
a
young
girl
my
heart
began
to
beat
quickly
as
i
wondered
which
of
these
men
was
edison
i
had
never
seen
his
photograph
and
i
had
the
greatest
admiration
for
his
genial
brain
i
sprang
out
of
the
carriage
and
the
dazzling
electric
light
made
it
seem
like
to
us
i
took
the
bouquet
which
edison
offered
me
and
thanked
her
for
it
but
all
the
time
i
was
endeavouring
to
discover
which
of
these
was
the
great
man
they
all
four
advanced
towards
me
but
i
noticed
the
flush
that
came
into
the
face
of
one
of
them
and
it
was
so
evident
from
the
expression
of
his
blue
eyes
that
he
was
intensely
bored
that
i
guessed
this
was
edison
i
felt
confused
and
embarrassed
myself
for
i
knew
very
well
that
i
was
causing
inconvenience
to
this
man
by
my
visit
he
of
course
imagined
that
it
was
due
to
the
idle
curiosity
of
a
foreigner
eager
to
court
publicity
he
was
no
doubt
thinking
of
the
interviewing
in
store
for
him
the
following
day
and
of
the
stupidities
he
would
be
made
to
utter
he
was
suffering
beforehand
at
the
idea
of
the
ignorant
questions
i
should
ask
him
of
all
the
explanations
he
would
out
of
politeness
be
obliged
to
give
me
and
at
that
moment
thomas
edison
took
a
dislike
to
me
his
wonderful
blue
eyes
more
luminous
than
his
incandescent
lamps
enabled
me
to
read
his
thoughts
i
immediately
understood
that
he
must
be
won
over
and
my
combative
instinct
had
recourse
to
all
my
powers
of
fascination
in
order
to
vanquish
this
delightful
but
bashful
i
made
such
an
effort
and
succeeded
so
well
that
half
an
hour
later
we
were
the
best
of
friends
i
followed
him
about
quickly
climbing
up
staircases
as
narrow
and
steep
as
ladders
crossing
bridges
suspended
in
the
air
above
veritable
furnaces
and
he
explained
everything
to
me
i
understood
all
and
i
admired
him
more
and
more
for
he
was
so
simple
and
charming
this
king
of
light
as
we
were
leaning
over
a
slightly
unsteady
bridge
above
the
terrible
abyss
in
which
immense
wheels
encased
in
wide
thongs
were
turning
whirling
about
and
rumbling
he
gave
various
orders
in
a
clear
voice
and
light
then
burst
forth
on
all
sides
sometimes
in
sputtering
greenish
jets
sometimes
in
quick
flashes
or
in
serpentine
trails
like
streams
of
fire
i
looked
at
this
man
of
medium
size
with
rather
a
large
head
and
a
profile
and
i
thought
of
napoleon
i
there
is
certainly
a
great
physical
resemblance
between
these
two
men
and
i
am
sure
that
one
compartment
of
their
brain
would
be
found
to
be
identical
of
course
i
do
not
compare
their
genius
the
one
was
destructive
and
the
other
creative
but
whilst
i
execrate
battles
i
adore
victories
and
in
spite
of
his
errors
i
have
raised
an
altar
in
my
heart
to
that
god
of
glory
napoleon
i
therefore
looked
at
edison
thoughtfully
for
he
reminded
me
of
the
great
man
who
was
dead
the
deafening
sound
of
the
machinery
the
dazzling
rapidity
of
the
changes
of
light
all
that
together
made
my
head
whirl
and
forgetting
where
i
was
i
leaned
for
support
on
the
slight
balustrade
which
separated
me
from
the
abyss
beneath
i
was
so
unconscious
of
all
danger
that
before
i
had
recovered
from
my
surprise
edison
had
helped
me
into
an
adjoining
room
and
installed
me
in
an
without
my
realising
how
it
had
all
happened
he
told
me
afterwards
that
i
had
turned
dizzy
after
having
done
the
honours
of
his
telephonic
discovery
and
of
his
astonishing
phonograph
edison
offered
me
his
arm
and
took
me
to
the
where
i
found
his
family
assembled
i
was
very
tired
and
did
justice
to
the
supper
that
had
been
so
hospitably
prepared
for
us
i
left
menlo
park
at
four
in
the
morning
and
the
time
the
country
round
the
roads
and
the
station
were
all
lighted
up
by
the
thousands
of
lamps
of
my
kind
host
what
a
strange
power
of
suggestion
the
darkness
has
i
thought
i
had
travelled
a
long
way
that
night
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
roads
were
impracticable
it
proved
to
be
quite
a
short
distance
and
the
roads
were
charming
although
they
were
now
covered
with
snow
imagination
had
played
a
great
part
during
the
journey
to
house
but
reality
played
a
much
greater
one
during
the
same
journey
back
to
the
station
i
was
enthusiastic
in
my
admiration
of
the
inventions
of
this
man
and
i
was
charmed
with
his
timid
graciousness
and
perfect
courtesy
and
with
his
profound
love
of
shakespeare
xxxiv
at
boston
story
of
the
whale
the
next
day
or
rather
that
same
day
for
it
was
then
four
in
the
morning
i
started
with
my
company
for
boston
abbey
my
had
arranged
for
me
to
have
a
delightful
but
it
was
nothing
like
the
wonderful
pullman
car
that
i
was
to
have
from
philadelphia
for
continuing
my
tour
i
was
very
much
pleased
with
this
one
nevertheless
in
the
middle
of
it
there
was
a
real
bed
large
and
comfortable
on
a
brass
bedstead
then
there
were
an
a
pretty
a
basket
tied
up
with
ribbons
for
my
dog
and
flowers
everywhere
but
flowers
without
an
overpowering
perfume
in
the
car
adjoining
mine
were
my
own
servants
who
were
also
very
comfortable
i
went
to
bed
feeling
thoroughly
satisfied
and
woke
up
at
boston
a
large
crowd
was
assembled
at
the
station
there
were
reporters
and
curious
men
and
women
a
public
decidedly
more
interested
than
friendly
not
badly
intentioned
but
by
no
means
enthusiastic
public
opinion
in
new
york
had
been
greatly
occupied
with
me
during
the
past
month
i
had
been
so
much
criticised
and
glorified
calumnies
of
all
kinds
stupid
and
disgusting
foolish
and
odious
had
been
circulated
about
me
some
people
blamed
and
others
admired
the
disdain
with
which
i
had
treated
these
turpitudes
but
every
one
knew
that
i
had
won
in
the
end
and
that
i
had
triumphed
over
all
and
everything
boston
knew
too
that
clergymen
had
preached
from
their
pulpits
saying
that
i
had
been
sent
by
the
old
world
to
corrupt
the
new
world
that
my
art
was
an
inspiration
from
hell
every
one
knew
all
this
but
the
public
wanted
to
see
for
itself
boston
belongs
especially
to
the
women
tradition
says
that
it
was
a
woman
who
first
set
foot
in
boston
women
form
the
majority
there
they
are
puritanical
with
intelligence
and
independent
with
a
certain
grace
i
passed
between
the
two
lines
formed
by
this
strange
courteous
and
cold
crowd
and
just
as
i
was
about
to
get
into
my
carriage
a
lady
advanced
towards
me
and
said
to
boston
madame
madame
and
she
held
out
a
soft
little
hand
to
me
american
women
generally
have
charming
hands
and
feet
other
people
now
approached
and
smiled
and
i
had
to
shake
hands
with
many
of
them
i
took
a
fancy
to
this
city
at
once
but
all
the
same
i
was
furious
for
a
moment
when
a
reporter
sprang
on
the
steps
of
the
carriage
just
as
we
were
driving
away
he
was
in
a
greater
hurry
and
more
audacious
than
any
of
the
others
but
he
was
certainly
overstepping
the
limits
and
i
pushed
the
impolite
fellow
back
angrily
jarrett
was
prepared
for
this
and
saved
him
by
the
collar
of
his
coat
otherwise
he
would
have
fallen
down
on
the
pavement
as
he
deserved
what
time
will
you
come
and
get
on
the
whale
this
extraordinary
personage
asked
i
gazed
at
him
in
bewilderment
he
spoke
french
perfectly
and
repeated
his
question
mad
i
said
in
a
low
voice
to
jarrett
madame
i
am
not
mad
but
i
should
like
to
know
at
what
time
you
will
come
and
get
on
the
whale
it
would
be
better
perhaps
to
come
this
evening
for
we
are
afraid
it
may
die
in
the
night
and
it
would
be
a
pity
for
you
not
to
come
and
pay
it
a
visit
while
it
still
has
he
went
on
talking
and
as
he
talked
he
half
seated
himself
beside
jarrett
who
was
still
holding
him
by
the
collar
lest
he
should
fall
out
of
the
carriage
monsieur
i
exclaimed
do
you
mean
what
is
all
this
about
a
whale
madame
he
replied
is
admirable
enormous
it
is
in
the
harbour
basin
and
there
are
men
employed
day
and
night
to
break
the
ice
all
round
he
broke
off
suddenly
and
standing
on
the
carriage
step
he
clutched
the
driver
stop
he
called
out
hi
henry
come
here
madame
here
she
is
the
carriage
drew
up
and
without
any
further
ceremony
he
jumped
down
and
pushed
into
my
landau
a
little
man
square
all
over
who
was
wearing
a
fur
cap
pulled
down
over
his
eyes
and
an
enormous
diamond
in
his
cravat
he
was
the
strangest
type
of
the
yankee
he
did
not
speak
a
word
of
french
but
he
took
his
seat
calmly
by
jarrett
whilst
the
reporter
remained
half
sitting
and
half
hanging
on
to
the
vehicle
there
had
been
three
of
us
when
we
started
from
the
station
and
we
were
five
when
we
reached
the
hotel
vendome
there
were
a
great
many
people
awaiting
my
arrival
and
i
was
quite
ashamed
of
my
new
companion
he
talked
in
a
loud
voice
laughed
coughed
spat
addressed
every
one
and
gave
every
one
invitations
all
the
people
seemed
to
be
delighted
a
little
girl
threw
her
arms
round
her
neck
exclaiming
yes
papa
do
please
let
us
go
but
we
must
ask
madame
he
replied
and
he
came
up
to
me
in
the
most
polite
and
courteous
manner
you
kindly
allow
us
to
join
your
party
when
you
go
to
see
the
whale
he
asked
monsieur
i
answered
delighted
to
have
to
do
with
a
gentleman
once
more
have
no
idea
what
all
this
means
for
the
last
quarter
of
an
hour
this
reporter
and
that
extraordinary
man
have
been
talking
about
a
whale
they
declare
authoritatively
that
i
must
go
and
pay
it
a
visit
and
i
know
absolutely
nothing
about
it
all
these
two
gentlemen
took
my
carriage
by
storm
installed
themselves
in
it
without
my
permission
and
as
you
see
are
giving
invitations
in
my
name
to
people
i
do
not
know
asking
them
to
go
with
me
to
a
place
about
which
i
know
nothing
for
the
purpose
of
paying
a
visit
to
a
whale
which
is
to
be
introduced
to
me
and
which
is
waiting
impatiently
to
die
in
the
kindly
disposed
gentleman
signed
to
his
daughter
to
come
with
us
and
accompanied
by
them
and
by
jarrett
and
madame
guérard
i
went
up
in
a
lift
to
the
door
of
my
suite
of
rooms
i
found
my
apartments
hung
with
valuable
pictures
and
full
of
magnificent
statues
i
felt
rather
disturbed
in
my
mind
for
among
these
objects
of
art
were
two
or
three
very
rare
and
beautiful
things
which
i
knew
must
have
cost
an
exorbitant
price
i
was
afraid
lest
any
of
them
should
be
stolen
and
i
spoke
of
my
fear
to
the
proprietor
of
the
hotel
to
whom
the
belong
he
answered
you
to
have
them
to
look
at
as
long
as
you
are
here
mademoiselle
and
when
i
expressed
my
anxiety
about
them
to
him
just
as
you
have
done
to
me
he
merely
remarked
that
was
all
the
same
to
as
to
the
pictures
they
belong
to
two
wealthy
there
was
among
them
a
superb
millet
which
i
should
very
much
have
liked
to
own
after
expressing
my
gratitude
and
admiring
these
treasures
i
asked
for
an
explanation
of
the
story
of
the
whale
and
max
gordon
the
father
of
the
little
girl
translated
for
me
what
the
little
man
in
the
fur
cap
had
said
it
appeared
that
he
owned
several
which
he
sent
out
for
his
own
benefit
one
of
these
boats
had
captured
an
enormous
whale
which
still
had
two
harpoons
in
it
the
poor
creature
was
thoroughly
exhausted
with
its
struggles
and
only
a
few
miles
distant
along
the
coast
so
it
had
been
easy
to
capture
it
and
bring
it
in
triumph
to
henry
smith
the
owner
of
the
boats
it
was
difficult
to
say
by
what
freak
of
fancy
and
by
what
turn
of
the
imagination
this
man
had
arrived
at
associating
in
his
mind
the
idea
of
the
whale
and
my
name
as
a
source
of
wealth
i
could
not
understand
it
but
the
fact
remained
that
he
insisted
in
such
a
droll
way
and
so
authoritatively
and
energetically
that
the
following
morning
at
seven
fifty
of
us
assembled
in
spite
of
the
icy
cold
rain
on
the
quay
gordon
had
given
orders
that
his
mail
coach
with
four
beautiful
horses
should
be
in
readiness
he
drove
himself
and
his
daughter
jarrett
my
sister
madame
guérard
and
another
elderly
lady
whose
name
i
have
forgotten
were
with
us
seven
other
carriages
followed
it
was
all
very
amusing
indeed
on
our
arrival
at
the
quay
we
were
received
by
this
comic
henry
this
time
from
head
to
foot
and
his
hands
encased
in
fingerless
woollen
gloves
only
his
eyes
and
his
huge
diamond
shone
out
from
his
furs
i
walked
along
the
quay
very
much
amused
and
interested
there
were
a
few
idlers
looking
on
also
and
alas
three
times
over
alas
there
were
reporters
shaggy
paw
then
seized
my
hand
and
he
drew
me
along
with
him
quickly
to
the
steps
i
only
just
escaped
breaking
my
neck
at
least
a
dozen
times
he
pushed
me
along
made
me
stumble
down
the
ten
steps
of
the
basin
and
i
next
found
myself
on
the
back
of
the
whale
they
assured
me
that
it
still
breathed
but
i
should
not
like
to
affirm
that
it
really
did
but
the
splashing
of
the
water
breaking
its
eddy
against
the
poor
creature
caused
it
to
oscillate
slightly
then
too
it
was
covered
with
glazed
frost
and
twice
i
fell
down
full
length
on
its
spine
i
laugh
about
it
now
but
i
was
furious
then
every
one
around
me
insisted
however
on
my
pulling
a
piece
of
whalebone
from
the
blade
of
the
poor
captured
creature
one
of
those
little
bones
which
are
used
for
corsets
i
did
not
like
to
do
this
as
i
feared
to
cause
it
suffering
and
i
was
sorry
for
the
poor
thing
as
three
of
us
henry
the
little
gordon
girl
and
i
had
been
skating
about
on
its
back
for
the
last
ten
minutes
finally
i
decided
to
do
it
i
pulled
out
the
little
whale
bone
and
went
up
the
steps
again
holding
my
poor
trophy
in
my
hand
i
felt
nervous
and
flustered
and
every
one
surrounded
me
i
was
annoyed
with
this
henry
smith
i
did
not
want
to
return
to
the
coach
as
i
thought
i
could
hide
bad
temper
better
in
one
of
the
huge
landaus
which
followed
but
the
charming
miss
gordon
asked
me
so
sweetly
why
i
would
not
ride
with
them
that
i
felt
my
anger
melt
away
before
the
smiling
face
you
like
to
drive
her
father
asked
me
and
i
accepted
with
pleasure
jarrett
immediately
proceeded
to
get
down
from
the
coach
as
quickly
as
his
age
and
corpulence
would
allow
him
you
are
going
to
drive
i
prefer
getting
down
he
said
and
he
took
a
seat
in
another
carriage
i
changed
places
boldly
with
gordon
in
order
to
drive
and
we
had
not
gone
a
hundred
yards
before
i
had
let
the
horses
make
for
a
shop
along
the
quay
and
got
the
coach
itself
up
on
to
the
footpath
so
that
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
quickness
and
energy
of
gordon
we
should
all
have
been
killed
on
arriving
at
the
hotel
i
went
to
bed
and
stayed
there
until
it
was
time
for
the
theatre
in
the
evening
we
played
that
night
to
a
full
house
the
seats
had
been
sold
to
the
highest
bidders
and
considerable
prices
were
obtained
for
them
we
gave
fifteen
performances
at
boston
at
an
average
of
nineteen
thousand
francs
for
each
performance
i
was
sorry
to
leave
that
city
as
i
had
spent
two
charming
weeks
there
my
mind
all
the
time
on
the
alert
when
holding
conversations
with
the
boston
women
they
are
puritans
from
the
crown
of
the
head
to
the
sole
of
the
foot
but
they
are
indulgent
and
there
is
no
bitterness
about
their
puritanism
what
struck
me
most
about
the
women
of
boston
was
the
harmony
of
their
gestures
and
the
softness
of
their
voices
brought
up
among
the
severest
and
harshest
of
traditions
the
bostonian
race
seems
to
me
to
be
the
most
refined
and
the
most
mysterious
of
all
the
american
races
as
the
women
are
in
the
majority
in
boston
many
of
the
young
girls
remain
unmarried
all
their
vital
forces
which
they
can
not
expend
in
love
and
in
maternity
they
employ
in
fortifying
and
making
supple
the
beauty
of
their
body
by
means
of
exercise
and
sports
without
losing
any
of
their
grace
all
the
reserves
of
heart
are
expended
in
intellectuality
they
adore
music
the
stage
literature
painting
and
poetry
they
know
everything
and
understand
everything
are
chaste
and
reserved
and
neither
laugh
nor
talk
very
loud
they
are
as
far
removed
from
the
latin
race
as
the
north
pole
is
from
the
south
pole
but
they
are
interesting
delightful
and
captivating
it
was
therefore
with
a
rather
heavy
heart
that
i
left
boston
for
new
haven
and
to
my
great
surprise
on
arriving
at
the
hotel
there
i
found
henry
smith
the
famous
whale
man
heavens
i
exclaimed
flinging
myself
into
an
armchair
does
this
man
want
now
with
me
i
was
not
left
in
ignorance
very
long
for
the
most
infernal
noise
of
brass
instruments
drums
trumpets
and
i
should
think
saucepans
drew
me
to
the
window
i
saw
an
immense
carriage
surrounded
by
an
escort
of
negroes
dressed
as
minstrels
on
this
carriage
was
an
abominable
monstrous
coloured
advertisement
representing
me
standing
on
the
whale
tearing
away
its
blade
while
it
struggled
to
defend
itself
some
followed
with
posters
on
which
were
written
the
following
words
and
see
the
enormous
cetacean
which
sarah
bernhardt
killed
by
tearing
out
its
whalebone
for
her
corsets
these
are
made
by
madame
lily
noe
who
lives
etc
etc
some
of
the
other
carried
posters
with
these
words
whale
is
just
as
flourishing
as
when
it
was
alive
it
has
five
hundred
worth
of
salt
in
its
stomach
and
every
day
the
ice
upon
which
it
is
resting
is
renewed
at
a
cost
of
one
hundred
dollars
my
face
turned
more
livid
than
that
of
a
corpse
and
my
teeth
chattered
with
fury
on
seeing
this
henry
smith
advanced
towards
me
and
i
struck
him
in
my
anger
and
then
rushed
away
to
my
room
where
i
sobbed
with
vexation
disgust
and
utter
weariness
i
wanted
to
start
back
to
europe
at
once
but
jarrett
showed
me
my
contract
i
then
wanted
to
take
steps
to
have
this
odious
exhibition
stopped
and
in
order
to
calm
me
i
was
promised
that
this
should
be
done
but
in
reality
nothing
was
done
at
all
two
days
later
i
was
at
hartford
and
the
same
whale
was
there
it
continued
its
tour
as
i
continued
mine
they
gave
it
more
salt
and
renewed
its
ice
and
it
went
on
its
way
so
that
i
came
across
it
everywhere
i
took
proceedings
about
it
but
in
every
state
i
was
obliged
to
begin
all
over
again
as
the
law
varied
in
the
different
states
and
every
time
i
arrived
at
a
fresh
hotel
i
found
there
an
immense
bouquet
awaiting
me
with
the
horrible
card
of
the
showman
of
the
whale
i
threw
his
flowers
on
the
ground
and
trampled
on
them
and
much
as
i
love
flowers
i
had
a
horror
of
these
jarrett
went
to
see
the
man
and
begged
him
not
to
send
me
any
more
bouquets
but
it
was
all
of
no
use
as
it
was
the
way
of
avenging
the
box
on
the
ears
i
had
given
him
then
too
he
could
not
understand
my
anger
he
was
making
any
amount
of
money
and
had
even
proposed
that
i
should
accept
a
percentage
of
the
receipts
ah
i
would
willingly
have
killed
that
execrable
smith
for
he
was
poisoning
my
life
i
could
see
nothing
else
in
all
the
different
cities
i
visited
and
i
used
to
shut
my
eyes
to
go
from
the
hotel
to
the
theatre
when
i
heard
the
minstrels
i
used
to
fly
into
a
rage
and
turn
green
with
anger
fortunately
i
was
able
to
rest
when
once
i
reached
montreal
where
i
was
not
followed
by
this
show
i
should
certainly
have
been
ill
if
it
had
continued
as
i
saw
nothing
but
that
i
could
think
of
nothing
else
and
my
very
dreams
were
about
it
it
haunted
me
it
was
an
obsession
and
a
perpetual
nightmare
when
i
left
hartford
jarrett
swore
to
me
that
smith
would
not
be
at
montreal
as
he
had
been
taken
suddenly
ill
i
strongly
suspected
that
jarrett
had
found
a
way
of
administering
to
him
some
violent
kind
of
medicine
which
had
stopped
his
journeying
for
the
time
i
felt
sure
of
this
as
the
ferocious
gentleman
laughed
so
heartily
but
anyhow
i
was
infinitely
grateful
to
him
for
ridding
me
of
the
man
for
the
present
xxxv
grand
reception
the
poet
frechette
an
escapade
on
the
lawrence
river
at
last
we
arrived
at
montreal
for
a
long
time
ever
since
my
earliest
childhood
i
had
dreamed
about
canada
i
had
always
heard
my
godfather
regret
with
considerable
fury
the
surrender
of
that
territory
by
france
to
england
i
had
heard
him
enumerate
without
very
clearly
understanding
them
the
pecuniary
advantages
of
canada
the
immense
fortune
that
lay
in
its
lands
and
that
country
had
seemed
to
my
imagination
the
promised
land
awakened
some
considerable
time
before
by
the
strident
whistle
of
the
engine
i
asked
what
time
it
was
eleven
in
the
evening
i
was
informed
we
were
within
fifteen
minutes
of
the
station
the
sky
was
black
and
smooth
like
a
steel
shield
lanterns
placed
at
distant
intervals
caught
the
whiteness
of
the
snow
heaped
up
there
for
how
many
days
the
train
stopped
suddenly
and
then
started
again
with
such
a
slow
and
timid
movement
that
i
fancied
that
there
might
be
a
possibility
of
its
running
off
the
rails
but
a
deadened
sound
growing
louder
every
second
fell
upon
my
attentive
ears
this
sound
soon
resolved
itself
into
music
and
it
was
in
the
midst
of
a
formidable
long
live
france
shouted
by
ten
thousand
throats
strengthened
by
an
orchestra
playing
the
with
a
frenzied
fury
that
we
made
our
entry
into
montreal
the
place
where
the
train
stopped
in
those
days
was
very
narrow
a
somewhat
high
bank
served
as
a
rampart
for
the
slight
platform
of
the
station
standing
on
the
small
step
of
my
carriage
i
looked
with
emotion
upon
the
strange
spectacle
i
had
before
me
the
bank
was
packed
with
bears
holding
lanterns
there
were
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
them
in
the
narrow
space
between
the
bank
and
the
train
which
had
come
to
a
stop
there
were
more
bears
large
and
small
and
i
wondered
with
terror
how
i
should
manage
to
reach
my
sleigh
jarrett
and
abbey
caused
the
crowd
to
make
way
and
i
got
out
but
a
deputy
whose
name
i
can
not
make
out
on
my
notes
what
commendation
for
my
writing
a
deputy
advanced
towards
me
and
handed
me
an
address
signed
by
the
notabilities
of
the
city
i
returned
thanks
as
best
i
could
and
took
the
magnificent
bouquet
of
flowers
that
was
tendered
in
the
name
of
the
signatories
to
the
address
when
i
lifted
the
flowers
to
my
face
in
order
to
smell
them
i
hurt
myself
slightly
with
their
pretty
petals
which
were
frozen
by
the
cold
however
i
began
myself
to
feel
both
arms
and
legs
were
getting
benumbed
the
cold
crept
over
my
whole
body
that
night
it
appears
was
one
of
the
coldest
that
had
been
experienced
for
many
years
past
the
women
who
had
come
to
be
present
at
the
arrival
of
the
french
company
had
been
compelled
to
withdraw
into
the
interior
of
the
station
with
the
exception
of
jos
doutre
who
handed
me
a
bouquet
of
rare
flowers
and
gave
me
a
kiss
the
temperature
was
degrees
below
zero
i
whispered
low
to
jarrett
us
continue
our
journey
i
am
turning
into
ice
in
ten
minutes
i
shall
not
be
able
to
move
a
jarrett
repeated
my
words
to
abbey
who
applied
to
the
chief
of
police
the
latter
gave
orders
in
english
and
another
police
officer
repeated
them
in
french
and
we
were
able
to
proceed
for
a
few
yards
but
the
main
station
was
still
some
way
off
the
crowd
grew
bigger
and
at
one
time
i
felt
as
though
i
were
about
to
faint
i
took
courage
however
holding
or
rather
hanging
on
to
the
arms
of
jarrett
and
abbey
every
minute
i
thought
i
should
fall
for
the
platform
was
like
a
mirror
we
were
obliged
however
to
stay
further
progress
a
hundred
lanterns
held
aloft
by
a
hundred
hands
suddenly
lit
up
the
place
a
tall
young
man
separated
himself
from
the
group
and
came
straight
towards
me
holding
a
wide
unrolled
piece
of
paper
and
in
a
loud
voice
declaimed
a
sarah
bernhardt

qui

la

à

encore
celle
de

louis
fréchette
he
read
very
well
it
is
true
but
those
lines
read
at
a
temperature
of
degrees
of
cold
to
a
poor
woman
dumfounded
through
listening
to
a
frenzied
stunned
by
the
mad
hurrahs
from
ten
thousand
throats
delirious
with
patriotic
fervour
were
more
than
my
strength
could
bear
i
made
superhuman
efforts
at
resistance
but
was
overwhelmed
with
fatigue
everything
appeared
to
be
turning
round
in
a
mad
farandole
i
felt
myself
raised
from
the
ground
and
heard
a
voice
which
seemed
to
come
from
far
away
room
for
our
french
lady
then
i
heard
nothing
further
and
only
recovered
my
senses
in
my
room
at
the
hotel
windsor
my
sister
jeanne
had
become
separated
from
me
by
the
movement
of
the
crowd
but
the
poet
fréchette
a
acted
as
escort
and
brought
her
several
minutes
later
safe
and
sound
but
trembling
on
my
account
and
this
is
what
she
told
me
imagine
when
the
crowd
was
pressing
against
you
seized
with
terror
on
seeing
your
head
fall
back
with
closed
eyes
on
to
shoulder
i
shouted
out
my
sister
is
being
i
had
become
mad
a
man
of
enormous
size
who
had
followed
us
for
a
long
time
worked
his
elbows
and
hips
to
make
the
enthusiastic
but
overexcited
mob
give
way
with
a
quick
movement
placed
himself
before
you
just
in
time
to
prevent
you
from
falling
the
man
whose
face
i
could
not
see
on
account
of
its
being
hidden
beneath
a
fur
cap
the
ear
flaps
of
which
covered
almost
his
entire
face
raised
you
up
as
though
you
had
been
a
flower
and
held
forth
to
the
crowd
in
english
i
did
not
understand
anything
he
said
but
the
canadians
were
struck
with
it
for
the
pushing
ceased
and
the
crowd
separated
into
two
compact
files
in
order
to
let
you
pass
through
i
can
assure
you
that
it
made
me
feel
quite
impressed
to
see
you
so
slender
with
your
head
back
and
the
whole
of
your
poor
frame
borne
at
length
by
that
hercules
i
followed
as
fast
as
i
could
but
having
caught
my
foot
in
the
flounce
of
my
skirt
i
had
to
stop
for
a
second
and
that
second
was
enough
to
separate
us
completely
the
crowd
having
closed
up
after
your
passage
formed
an
impenetrable
barrier
i
can
assure
you
dear
sister
that
i
felt
anything
but
at
ease
and
it
was
fréchette
who
saved
i
shook
the
hand
of
that
worthy
gentleman
and
thanked
him
this
time
as
well
as
i
could
for
his
fine
poem
then
i
spoke
to
him
of
other
poems
of
his
a
volume
of
which
i
had
obtained
at
new
york
for
alas
to
my
shame
i
must
acknowledge
it
i
knew
nothing
about
fréchette
up
to
the
time
of
my
departure
from
france
and
yet
he
was
already
known
a
little
in
paris
he
was
very
much
touched
with
the
several
lines
i
dwelt
upon
as
the
finest
of
his
work
he
thanked
me
we
remained
friends
the
day
following
nine
had
hardly
struck
when
a
card
was
sent
up
to
me
on
which
were
written
these
words
who
had
the
joy
of
saving
you
madame
begs
that
your
kindness
will
grant
him
a
i
directed
that
the
man
should
be
shown
into
the
and
after
notifying
jarrett
went
to
waken
my
sister
with
me
i
said
she
slipped
on
a
chinese
and
we
went
in
the
direction
of
the
large
the
immense
of
my
suite
for
a
bicycle
would
have
been
necessary
to
traverse
without
fatigue
the
entire
length
of
my
rooms
and
bedroom
on
opening
the
door
i
was
struck
by
the
beauty
of
the
man
who
was
before
me
he
was
very
tall
with
wide
shoulders
small
head
a
hard
look
hair
thick
and
curly
tanned
complexion
the
man
was
but
seemed
uneasy
he
blushed
slightly
on
seeing
me
i
expressed
my
gratitude
and
asked
to
be
excused
for
my
foolish
weakness
i
received
joyfully
the
bouquet
of
violets
he
handed
me
on
taking
leave
he
said
in
a
low
voice
you
ever
hear
who
i
am
swear
that
you
will
only
think
of
the
slight
service
i
have
rendered
at
that
moment
jarrett
entered
his
face
was
pale
as
he
walked
towards
the
stranger
and
spoke
to
him
in
english
i
could
however
catch
the
words
door
assassination
impossibility
new
the
sunburnt
complexion
became
chalky
his
nostrils
quivered
as
he
glanced
towards
the
door
then
as
flight
appeared
impossible
he
looked
at
jarrett
and
in
a
peremptory
tone
as
cold
as
flint
said
as
he
went
towards
the
door
my
hands
which
had
opened
under
the
stupor
let
fall
his
bouquet
which
he
picked
up
whilst
looking
at
me
with
a
supplicating
and
appealing
air
i
understood
and
said
to
him
in
a
loud
tone
of
voice
swear
to
it
the
man
disappeared
with
his
flowers
i
heard
the
uproar
of
people
behind
the
door
and
of
the
crowd
in
the
street
i
did
not
wish
to
listen
to
anything
further
when
my
sister
of
a
romantic
and
foolish
turn
of
mind
wished
to
tell
me
about
the
horrible
thing
i
closed
my
ears
four
months
afterwards
when
an
attempt
was
made
to
read
aloud
to
me
an
account
of
his
death
by
hanging
i
refused
to
hear
anything
about
it
and
now
after
years
have
passed
and
i
know
i
only
wish
to
remember
the
service
rendered
and
my
pledged
word
this
incident
left
me
somewhat
sad
the
anger
of
the
bishop
of
montreal
was
necessary
to
enable
me
to
regain
my
good
humour
that
prelate
after
holding
forth
in
the
pulpit
against
the
immorality
of
french
literature
forbade
his
flock
to
go
the
theatre
he
spoke
violently
and
spitefully
against
modern
france
as
to
play
he
tore
it
into
shreds
as
it
were
declaiming
against
the
immoral
love
of
the
and
of
the
hero
and
against
the
adulterous
love
of
the
princesse
de
bouillon
but
the
truth
showed
itself
in
spite
of
all
and
he
cried
out
with
fury
intensified
by
outrage
this
infamous
lucubration
of
french
authors
there
is
a
court
abbé
who
thanks
to
the
unbounded
licentiousness
of
his
expressions
constitutes
a
direct
insult
to
the
finally
he
pronounced
an
anathema
against
scribe
who
was
already
dead
against
legouvé
against
me
and
against
all
my
company
the
result
was
that
crowds
came
from
everywhere
and
the
four
performances
dame
aux
matinée
and
had
a
colossal
success
and
brought
in
fabulous
receipts
i
was
invited
by
the
poet
fréchette
and
a
banker
whose
name
i
do
not
remember
to
pay
a
visit
to
the
iroquois
i
accepted
with
joy
and
went
there
accompanied
by
my
sister
jarrett
and
angelo
who
was
always
ready
for
a
dangerous
excursion
i
felt
in
safety
in
the
presence
of
this
artiste
full
of
bravery
and
composure
and
gifted
with
herculean
strength
the
only
thing
he
lacked
to
make
him
perfect
was
talent
he
had
none
then
and
never
did
have
any
the
lawrence
river
was
frozen
over
almost
entirely
we
crossed
it
in
a
carriage
along
a
route
indicated
by
two
rows
of
branches
fixed
in
the
ice
we
had
four
carriages
the
distance
between
caughnanwaga
and
montreal
was
five
kilometres
this
visit
to
the
iroquois
was
deliciously
enchanting
i
was
introduced
to
the
chief
father
and
mayor
of
the
iroquois
tribes
alas
this
former
chief
son
of
white
eagle
surnamed
during
his
childhood
of
the
nights
now
clothed
in
sorry
european
rags
was
selling
liquor
thread
needles
flax
pork
fat
chocolate
all
that
remained
of
his
mad
rovings
through
the
old
wild
forests
when
he
roamed
naked
over
a
land
free
of
all
allegiance
was
the
stupor
of
the
bull
held
prisoner
by
the
horns
it
is
true
he
also
sold
brandy
and
that
he
quenched
his
thirst
as
did
all
of
them
at
that
source
of
forgetfulness
sun
of
the
nights
introduced
me
to
his
daughter
a
girl
of
eighteen
to
twenty
years
of
age
insipid
and
devoid
of
beauty
and
grace
she
sat
down
at
the
piano
and
played
a
tune
that
was
popular
at
the
time
i
do
not
remember
what
i
was
in
a
hurry
to
leave
the
store
the
home
of
these
two
victims
of
civilisation
i
visited
caughnanwaga
but
found
no
pleasure
in
it
the
same
compression
of
the
throat
the
same
retrospective
anguish
caused
me
to
revolt
against
cowardice
which
hid
under
the
name
of
civilisation
the
most
unjust
and
most
protected
of
crimes
i
returned
to
montreal
somewhat
sad
and
tired
the
success
of
our
four
performances
was
extraordinary
but
what
gave
them
a
special
charm
in
my
eyes
was
the
infernal
and
joyous
noise
made
by
the
students
the
doors
of
the
theatre
were
opened
every
day
one
hour
in
advance
for
them
they
then
arranged
matters
to
suit
themselves
most
of
them
were
gifted
with
magnificent
voices
they
separated
into
groups
according
to
the
requirements
of
the
songs
they
wished
to
sing
they
then
prepared
by
means
of
a
strong
string
worked
by
a
pulley
the
aerial
route
that
was
to
be
followed
by
the
baskets
which
descended
from
their
paradise
to
where
i
was
they
tied
ribbons
round
the
necks
of
doves
bearing
sonnets
and
good
wishes
these
flowers
and
birds
were
sent
off
during
the
and
by
a
happy
disposition
of
the
strings
the
flowers
fell
at
my
feet
the
doves
flew
where
their
astonishment
led
them
and
every
evening
these
messages
of
grace
and
beauty
were
repeated
i
experienced
considerable
emotion
the
first
evening
the
marquis
of
lorne
of
queen
victoria
governor
of
canada
was
of
royal
punctuality
the
students
knew
it
the
house
was
noisy
and
quivering
through
an
opening
in
the
curtain
i
gazed
on
the
composition
of
this
assembly
all
of
a
sudden
a
silence
came
over
it
without
any
outward
reason
for
it
and
the
was
sung
by
three
hundred
warm
young
male
voices
with
a
courtesy
full
of
grandeur
the
governor
stood
up
at
the
first
notes
of
our
national
hymn
the
whole
house
was
on
its
feet
in
a
second
and
the
magnificent
anthem
echoed
in
our
hearts
like
a
call
from
the
i
do
not
believe
i
ever
heard
the
sung
with
keener
emotion
and
unanimity
as
soon
as
it
was
over
the
plaudits
of
the
crowd
broke
out
three
times
over
then
upon
a
sharp
gesture
from
the
governor
the
band
played
save
the
i
never
saw
a
prouder
or
more
dignified
gesture
than
that
of
the
marquis
of
lorne
when
he
motioned
to
the
conductor
of
the
orchestra
he
was
quite
willing
to
allow
these
sons
of
submissive
frenchmen
to
feel
a
regret
perhaps
even
a
flickering
hope
the
first
on
his
feet
he
listened
to
that
fine
plaint
with
respect
but
he
smothered
its
last
echo
beneath
the
english
national
anthem
being
an
englishman
he
was
incontestably
right
in
doing
so
i
gave
for
the
last
performance
on
december
christmas
day
the
bishop
of
montreal
again
thundered
against
me
against
scribe
and
legouvé
and
the
poor
artistes
who
had
come
with
me
who
could
not
help
it
i
do
not
know
whether
he
did
not
even
threaten
to
excommunicate
all
of
us
living
and
dead
lovers
of
france
and
french
art
in
order
to
reply
to
his
abusive
attack
unyoked
my
horses
and
my
sleigh
was
almost
carried
by
an
immense
crowd
among
which
were
the
deputies
and
notabilities
of
the
city
one
has
only
to
consult
the
daily
papers
of
that
period
to
realise
the
crushing
effect
caused
by
such
a
triumphant
return
to
my
hotel
the
day
following
sunday
i
went
at
seven
in
the
morning
in
company
with
jarrett
and
my
sister
for
a
promenade
on
the
banks
of
the
lawrence
river
at
a
given
moment
i
ordered
the
carriage
to
stop
with
the
object
of
walking
a
little
way
my
sister
laughingly
said
if
we
climb
on
to
that
large
piece
of
ice
that
seems
ready
to
crack
no
sooner
thought
of
than
done
and
behold
both
of
us
walking
on
the
ice
trying
to
break
it
loose
all
of
a
sudden
a
loud
shout
from
jarrett
made
us
understand
that
we
had
succeeded
as
a
matter
of
fact
our
ice
barque
was
already
floating
free
in
the
narrow
channel
of
the
river
that
remained
always
open
on
account
of
the
force
of
the
current
my
sister
and
i
sat
down
for
the
piece
of
ice
rocked
about
in
every
direction
making
both
of
us
laugh
inordinately
cries
caused
people
to
gather
men
armed
with
endeavoured
to
stop
our
progress
but
it
was
not
easy
for
the
edges
of
the
channel
were
too
friable
to
bear
the
weight
of
a
man
ropes
were
thrown
out
to
us
we
caught
hold
of
one
of
them
with
our
four
hands
but
the
sudden
pull
of
the
men
in
drawing
us
towards
them
cast
our
raft
so
suddenly
against
the
ice
edges
that
it
broke
in
two
and
we
remained
full
of
fear
this
time
on
one
small
part
of
our
skiff
i
laughed
no
longer
for
we
were
beginning
to
travel
somewhat
fast
and
the
channel
was
opening
out
in
width
but
in
one
of
the
turns
it
made
we
were
fortunately
squeezed
in
between
two
immense
blocks
and
to
this
fact
we
owed
being
able
to
escape
with
our
lives
the
men
who
had
followed
our
very
rapid
ride
with
real
courage
climbed
on
to
the
blocks
a
harpoon
was
thrown
with
marvellous
skill
on
to
our
icy
wreck
so
as
to
retain
us
in
our
position
for
the
current
rather
strong
underneath
might
have
caused
us
to
move
a
ladder
was
brought
and
planted
against
one
of
the
large
blocks
its
steps
afforded
us
means
of
delivery
my
sister
was
the
first
to
climb
up
and
i
followed
somewhat
ashamed
at
our
ridiculous
escapade
during
the
length
of
time
required
to
regain
the
bank
the
carriage
with
jarrett
in
it
was
able
to
rejoin
us
he
was
pallid
not
from
fear
of
the
danger
i
had
undergone
but
at
the
idea
that
if
i
died
the
tour
would
come
to
an
end
he
said
to
me
quite
seriously
you
had
lost
your
life
madame
you
would
have
been
dishonest
for
you
would
have
broken
your
contract
of
your
own
free
we
had
just
enough
time
to
get
to
the
station
where
the
train
was
ready
to
take
me
to
springfield
an
immense
crowd
was
waiting
and
it
was
with
the
same
cry
of
love
underlined
with
that
the
canadian
public
wished
us
xxxvi
springfield
baltimore
philadelphia
chicago
adventures
between
louis
and
cincinnati
capital
punishment
after
our
immense
and
noisy
success
at
montreal
we
were
somewhat
surprised
with
the
icy
welcome
of
the
public
at
springfield
we
played
dame
aux
in
america
why
no
one
was
ever
able
to
tell
me
this
play
which
the
public
rushed
to
see
in
crowds
shocked
the
puritanism
of
the
small
american
towns
the
critics
of
the
large
cities
discussed
this
modern
magdalene
but
those
of
the
small
towns
began
by
throwing
stones
at
her
this
stilted
reserve
on
the
part
of
the
public
prejudiced
against
the
impurity
of
marguerite
gautier
we
met
with
from
time
to
time
in
the
small
cities
springfield
at
that
time
had
barely
thirty
thousand
inhabitants
during
the
day
i
passed
at
springfield
i
called
at
a
to
purchase
a
rifle
the
salesman
showed
me
into
a
long
and
very
narrow
courtyard
where
i
tried
several
shots
on
turning
round
i
was
surprised
and
confused
to
see
two
gentlemen
taking
an
interest
in
my
shooting
i
wished
to
withdraw
at
once
but
one
of
them
came
up
to
me
you
like
madame
to
come
and
fire
off
a
cannon
i
almost
fell
to
the
ground
with
surprise
and
did
not
reply
for
a
second
then
i
said
i
an
appointment
was
made
with
my
strange
questioner
who
was
the
director
of
the
colt
gun
factory
an
hour
afterwards
i
went
to
the
rendezvous
more
than
thirty
people
who
had
been
hastily
invited
were
there
already
it
got
on
my
nerves
a
trifle
i
fired
off
the
newly
invented
cannon
it
amused
me
very
much
without
procuring
me
any
emotion
and
that
evening
after
the
icy
performance
we
left
for
baltimore
with
a
vertiginous
rush
the
play
having
finished
later
than
the
hour
fixed
for
the
departure
of
the
train
it
was
necessary
to
catch
it
up
at
any
cost
the
three
enormous
carriages
that
made
up
my
special
train
went
off
under
full
steam
with
two
engines
we
bounded
over
the
metals
and
dropped
again
thanks
to
some
miracle
we
finally
succeeded
in
catching
up
the
express
which
knew
we
were
on
its
track
having
been
warned
by
telegram
it
made
a
short
stop
just
long
enough
to
couple
us
to
it
anyhow
and
in
that
way
we
reached
baltimore
where
i
stayed
four
days
and
gave
five
performances
two
things
struck
me
in
that
city
the
deadly
cold
in
the
hotels
and
the
theatre
and
the
loveliness
of
the
women
i
felt
a
profound
sadness
at
baltimore
for
i
spent
the
of
january
far
from
everything
that
was
dear
to
me
i
wept
all
night
and
underwent
that
moment
of
discouragement
that
makes
one
wish
for
death
our
success
however
had
been
colossal
in
that
charming
city
which
i
left
with
regret
to
go
to
philadelphia
where
we
were
to
remain
a
week
that
handsome
city
i
do
not
care
for
i
received
an
enthusiastic
welcome
there
in
spite
of
a
change
of
programme
the
first
evening
two
artistes
having
missed
the
train
we
could
not
play
and
i
had
to
replace
it
by
the
only
piece
in
which
the
absentees
could
be
replaced
the
receipts
averaged
twenty
thousand
francs
for
the
seven
performances
given
in
six
days
my
sojourn
was
saddened
by
a
letter
announcing
the
death
of
my
friend
gustave
flaubert
the
writer
who
had
the
beauty
of
our
language
at
heart
from
philadelphia
we
proceeded
to
chicago
at
the
station
i
was
received
by
a
deputation
of
chicago
ladies
and
a
bouquet
of
rare
flowers
was
handed
to
me
by
a
delightful
young
lady
madame
lily
jarrett
then
led
me
into
one
of
the
rooms
of
the
station
where
the
french
delegates
were
waiting
a
very
short
but
highly
emotional
speech
from
our
consul
spread
confidence
and
friendly
feelings
among
every
one
and
after
having
returned
heartfelt
thanks
i
was
preparing
to
leave
the
station
when
i
stopped
stupefied
and
it
seems
that
my
features
assumed
such
an
intense
expression
of
suffering
that
everybody
ran
towards
me
to
offer
assistance
but
a
sudden
anger
electrified
all
my
being
and
i
walked
straight
towards
the
horrible
vision
that
had
just
appeared
before
me
the
whale
man
he
was
alive
that
terrible
smith
enveloped
in
furs
with
diamonds
on
all
of
his
fingers
he
was
there
with
a
bouquet
in
his
hand
the
wretched
brute
i
refused
the
flowers
and
repulsed
him
with
all
my
strength
increased
tenfold
by
anger
and
a
flood
of
confused
words
escaped
from
my
pallid
lips
but
this
scene
charmed
him
for
it
was
repeated
and
spread
about
magnified
and
the
whale
had
more
visitors
than
ever
i
went
to
the
palmer
house
one
of
the
most
magnificent
hotels
of
that
day
whose
proprietor
was
a
perfect
gentleman
courteous
kind
and
generous
for
he
filled
the
immense
apartment
i
occupied
with
the
rarest
flowers
and
taxed
his
ingenuity
in
order
to
have
my
meals
cooked
and
served
in
the
french
style
a
difficult
matter
in
those
days
we
were
to
remain
a
fortnight
in
chicago
our
success
exceeded
all
expectations
these
two
weeks
seemed
to
me
the
most
agreeable
days
i
had
had
since
my
arrival
in
america
first
of
all
there
was
the
vitality
of
the
city
in
which
men
pass
each
other
without
ever
stopping
with
knitted
brows
with
one
thought
in
mind
end
to
they
move
on
and
on
never
turning
for
a
cry
or
prudent
warning
what
takes
place
behind
them
matters
little
they
do
not
wish
to
know
why
a
cry
is
raised
and
they
have
no
time
to
be
prudent
end
to
awaits
them
women
here
as
everywhere
else
in
america
do
not
work
but
they
do
not
stroll
about
the
streets
as
in
other
cities
they
walk
quickly
they
also
are
in
a
hurry
to
seek
amusement
during
the
day
time
i
went
some
distance
into
the
surrounding
country
in
order
not
to
meet
the
advertising
the
whale
one
day
i
went
to
the
ah
what
a
dreadful
and
magnificent
sight
there
were
three
of
us
my
sister
myself
and
an
englishman
a
friend
of
mine
on
arrival
we
saw
hundreds
of
pigs
hurrying
bunched
together
grunting
and
snorting
along
a
small
narrow
raised
bridge
our
carriage
passed
under
this
bridge
and
stopped
before
a
group
of
men
who
were
waiting
for
us
the
manager
of
the
received
us
and
led
the
way
to
the
special
on
entering
into
the
immense
shed
which
is
dimly
lighted
by
windows
with
greasy
and
ruddy
panes
an
abominable
smell
gets
into
your
throat
a
smell
that
only
leaves
one
several
days
afterwards
a
sanguinary
mist
rises
everywhere
like
a
light
cloud
floating
on
the
side
of
a
mountain
and
lit
up
by
the
setting
sun
an
infernal
hubbub
drums
itself
into
your
brain
the
almost
human
cries
of
the
pigs
being
slaughtered
the
violent
strokes
of
the
hatchets
lopping
off
the
limbs
the
repeated
shouts
of
the
who
with
a
superb
and
sweeping
gesture
lifts
the
heavy
hatchet
and
with
one
stroke
opens
from
top
to
bottom
the
unfortunate
quivering
animal
hung
on
a
hook
during
the
terror
of
the
moment
one
hears
the
continuous
grating
of
the
revolving
razor
which
in
one
second
removes
the
bristles
from
the
trunk
thrown
to
it
by
the
machine
that
has
cut
off
the
four
legs
the
whistle
of
the
escaping
steam
from
the
hot
water
in
which
the
head
of
the
animal
is
scalded
the
rippling
of
the
water
that
is
constantly
renewed
the
cascade
of
the
waste
water
the
rumbling
of
the
small
trains
carrying
under
wide
arches
trucks
loaded
with
hams
sausages
and
the
whistling
of
the
engines
warning
one
of
the
danger
of
their
approach
which
in
this
spot
of
terrible
massacre
seems
to
be
the
perpetual
knell
of
wretched
agonies
nothing
was
more
hoffmanesque
than
this
slaughter
of
pigs
at
the
period
i
am
speaking
about
for
since
then
a
sentiment
of
humanity
has
crept
although
still
somewhat
timidly
into
this
temple
of
porcine
hecatombs
i
returned
from
this
visit
quite
that
evening
i
played
in
i
went
on
to
the
stage
quite
unnerved
and
trying
to
do
everything
to
get
rid
of
the
horrible
vision
of
the
i
threw
myself
heart
and
soul
into
my
so
much
so
that
at
the
end
of
the
fourth
act
i
absolutely
fainted
on
the
stage
on
the
day
of
my
last
performance
a
magnificent
collar
of
camellias
in
diamonds
was
handed
me
on
behalf
of
the
ladies
of
chicago
i
left
that
city
fond
of
everything
in
it
its
people
its
lake
as
big
as
a
small
inland
sea
its
audiences
who
were
so
enthusiastic
everything
everything
except
its
i
did
not
even
bear
any
towards
the
bishop
who
also
as
had
happened
in
other
cities
had
denounced
my
art
and
french
literature
by
the
violence
of
his
sermons
he
had
as
a
matter
of
fact
advertised
us
so
well
that
abbey
the
manager
wrote
the
following
letter
to
him
grace
whenever
i
visit
your
city
i
am
accustomed
to
spend
four
hundred
dollars
in
advertising
but
as
you
have
done
the
advertising
for
me
i
send
you
two
hundred
dollars
for
your
poor
we
left
chicago
to
go
to
louis
where
we
arrived
after
having
covered
miles
in
fourteen
hours
in
the
of
my
car
abbey
and
jarrett
showed
me
the
statement
of
the
performances
that
had
been
given
since
our
arrival
the
gross
receipts
were
that
is
to
say
francs
an
average
of
francs
per
performance
this
gave
me
great
pleasure
on
henry
account
for
he
had
lost
all
he
had
in
his
previous
tour
with
an
admirable
troup
of
opera
artistes
and
greater
pleasure
still
on
my
own
account
as
i
was
to
receive
a
good
share
of
the
takings
we
stayed
at
louis
all
the
week
from
january
to
i
must
admit
that
this
city
which
was
specially
french
was
less
to
my
liking
than
the
other
american
cities
as
it
was
dirty
and
the
hotels
were
not
very
comfortable
since
then
louis
has
made
great
strides
but
it
was
the
germans
who
planted
there
the
bulb
of
progress
at
the
time
of
which
i
speak
the
year
the
city
was
repulsively
dirty
in
those
days
alas
we
were
not
great
at
colonising
and
all
the
cities
where
french
influence
preponderated
were
poor
and
behind
the
times
i
was
bored
to
death
at
louis
and
i
wanted
to
leave
the
place
at
once
after
paying
an
indemnity
to
the
manager
but
jarrett
the
upright
man
the
stern
man
of
duty
the
ferocious
man
said
to
me
holding
my
contract
in
his
hand
madame
you
must
stay
you
can
die
of
here
if
you
like
but
stay
you
by
way
of
entertaining
me
he
took
me
to
a
celebrated
grotto
where
we
were
to
see
some
millions
of
fish
without
eyes
the
light
had
never
penetrated
into
this
grotto
and
as
the
first
fish
who
lived
there
had
no
use
for
their
eyes
their
descendants
had
no
eyes
at
all
we
went
to
see
this
grotto
it
was
a
long
way
off
we
went
down
and
groped
our
way
to
the
grotto
very
cautiously
on
all
fours
like
cats
the
road
seemed
to
me
interminable
but
at
last
the
guide
told
us
that
we
had
arrived
at
our
destination
we
were
able
to
stand
upright
again
as
the
grotto
itself
was
higher
i
could
see
nothing
but
i
heard
a
match
being
struck
and
the
guide
then
lighted
a
small
lantern
just
in
front
of
me
nearly
at
my
feet
was
a
rather
deep
natural
basin
see
remarked
our
guide
phlegmatically
is
the
pond
but
just
at
present
there
is
no
water
in
it
neither
are
there
any
fish
you
must
come
again
in
three
jarrett
made
such
a
fearful
grimace
that
i
was
seized
with
an
uncontrollable
fit
of
laughter
of
that
kind
of
laughter
which
borders
on
madness
i
was
suffocated
with
it
and
i
choked
and
laughed
till
the
tears
came
i
then
went
down
into
the
basin
of
the
pond
in
search
of
a
relic
of
some
kind
a
little
skeleton
of
a
dead
fish
or
anything
no
matter
what
there
was
nothing
to
be
found
though
absolutely
nothing
we
had
to
return
on
all
fours
as
we
came
i
made
jarrett
go
first
and
the
sight
of
his
big
back
in
his
fur
coat
and
of
him
walking
on
hands
and
feet
grumbling
and
swearing
as
he
went
gave
me
such
delight
that
i
no
longer
regretted
anything
and
i
gave
ten
dollars
to
the
guide
for
his
ineffable
surprise
we
returned
to
the
hotel
and
i
was
informed
that
a
jeweller
had
been
waiting
for
me
more
than
two
hours
jeweller
i
exclaimed
i
have
no
intention
of
buying
any
jewellery
i
have
too
much
as
it
jarrett
however
winked
at
abbey
who
was
there
as
we
entered
i
saw
at
once
that
there
was
some
understanding
between
the
jeweller
and
my
two
i
was
told
that
my
ornaments
needed
cleaning
that
the
jeweller
would
undertake
to
make
them
look
like
new
repair
them
if
they
required
it
and
in
a
word
exhibit
them
i
rebelled
but
it
was
of
no
use
jarrett
assured
me
that
the
ladies
of
louis
were
particularly
fond
of
shows
of
this
kind
he
said
it
would
be
an
excellent
advertisement
that
my
jewellery
was
very
much
tarnished
that
several
stones
were
missing
and
that
this
man
would
replace
them
for
nothing
a
saving
he
added
think
of
it
i
gave
up
for
discussions
of
that
kind
bore
me
to
death
and
two
days
later
the
ladies
of
louis
went
to
admire
my
ornaments
in
this
under
a
blaze
of
light
poor
madame
guérard
who
also
went
to
see
them
came
back
horrified
have
added
to
your
things
she
said
pairs
of
earrings
two
necklaces
and
thirty
rings
a
lorgnette
studded
with
diamonds
and
rubies
a
gold
set
with
turquoises
a
small
pipe
the
amber
mouthpiece
of
which
is
encircled
with
diamond
stars
sixteen
bracelets
a
studded
with
sapphires
a
pair
of
spectacles
with
gold
mounts
ending
with
small
acorns
of
pearls
must
have
been
made
specially
said
poor
guérard
there
be
any
one
who
would
wear
such
glasses
and
on
them
were
written
the
words
which
madame
sarah
bernhardt
wears
when
she
is
at
i
certainly
thought
that
this
was
exceeding
all
the
limits
allowed
to
advertisement
to
make
me
smoke
pipes
and
wear
spectacles
was
going
rather
too
far
and
i
got
into
my
carriage
and
drove
at
once
to
the
i
arrived
just
in
time
to
find
the
place
closed
it
was
five
on
saturday
afternoon
the
lights
were
out
and
everything
was
dark
and
silent
i
returned
to
the
hotel
and
spoke
to
jarrett
of
my
annoyance
does
it
all
matter
madame
he
said
tranquilly
many
girls
wear
spectacles
and
as
to
the
pipe
the
jeweller
tells
me
he
has
received
five
orders
from
it
and
that
it
is
going
to
be
quite
the
fashion
anyhow
it
is
of
no
use
worrying
about
the
matter
as
the
exhibition
is
now
over
your
jewellery
will
be
returned
tonight
and
we
leave
here
the
day
after
that
evening
the
jeweller
returned
all
the
objects
i
had
lent
him
and
they
had
been
polished
and
repaired
so
that
they
looked
quite
new
he
had
included
with
them
a
gold
set
with
turquoises
the
very
one
that
had
been
on
view
i
simply
could
not
make
that
man
understand
anything
and
my
anger
cooled
down
when
confronted
by
his
pleasant
manner
and
his
joy
this
advertisement
though
came
very
near
costing
me
my
life
tempted
by
this
huge
quantity
of
jewellery
the
greater
part
of
which
did
not
belong
to
me
a
little
band
of
sharpers
planned
to
rob
me
believing
that
they
would
find
all
these
valuables
in
the
large
which
my
steward
always
carried
on
sunday
january
we
left
louis
at
eight
in
the
morning
for
cincinnati
i
was
in
my
magnificently
appointed
pullman
car
and
i
had
requested
that
the
car
should
be
put
at
the
end
of
our
special
train
so
that
from
the
platform
i
might
enjoy
the
beauty
of
the
landscape
which
passes
before
one
like
a
continually
changing
living
panorama
we
had
scarcely
been
more
than
ten
minutes
when
the
guard
suddenly
stooped
down
and
looked
over
the
little
balcony
he
then
drew
back
quickly
and
his
face
turned
pale
seizing
my
hand
he
said
in
a
very
excited
tone
in
english
go
inside
madame
i
understood
that
we
were
in
danger
of
some
kind
he
pulled
the
alarm
signal
made
a
sign
to
another
guard
and
before
the
train
had
quite
come
to
a
standstill
the
two
men
sprang
down
and
disappeared
under
the
train
the
guard
had
fired
a
revolver
in
order
to
attract
every
attention
and
jarrett
abbey
and
the
artistes
hurried
out
into
the
narrow
corridor
i
found
myself
in
the
midst
of
them
and
to
our
stupefaction
we
saw
the
two
guards
dragging
out
from
underneath
my
compartment
a
man
armed
to
the
teeth
with
a
revolver
held
to
his
temple
on
either
side
he
decided
to
confess
the
truth
of
the
matter
the
exhibition
had
excited
the
envy
of
all
the
gangs
of
thieves
and
this
man
had
been
despatched
by
an
organised
band
at
louis
to
relieve
me
of
my
jewellery
he
was
to
unhook
my
carriage
from
the
rest
of
the
train
between
louis
and
cincinnati
at
a
certain
spot
known
as
the
as
this
was
to
be
done
during
the
night
and
as
my
carriage
was
the
last
the
thing
was
comparatively
easy
since
it
was
only
a
question
of
lifting
the
enormous
hook
and
drawing
it
out
of
the
link
the
man
a
veritable
giant
was
fastened
on
to
my
carriage
we
examined
his
apparatus
and
found
that
it
merely
consisted
of
very
thick
wide
straps
of
leather
about
half
a
yard
wide
by
means
of
these
he
was
secured
firmly
to
the
underpart
of
the
train
with
his
hands
perfectly
free
the
courage
and
the
of
that
man
were
admirable
he
told
us
that
seven
armed
men
were
waiting
for
us
at
the
little
incline
and
that
they
certainly
would
not
have
injured
us
if
we
had
not
attempted
to
resist
for
all
they
wanted
was
my
jewellery
and
the
money
which
the
secretary
carried
two
thousand
three
hundred
dollars
oh
he
knew
everything
he
knew
every
name
and
he
gabbled
on
in
bad
french
as
for
you
madame
we
should
not
have
done
you
any
harm
in
spite
of
your
pretty
little
revolver
we
should
even
have
let
you
keep
and
so
this
man
and
his
gang
knew
that
the
secretary
slept
at
my
end
of
the
train
and
that
he
was
not
to
be
dreaded
much
poor
chatterton
that
he
had
with
him
two
thousand
three
hundred
dollars
and
that
i
had
a
very
prettily
chased
revolver
ornamented
with
the
man
was
firmly
bound
and
taken
in
charge
by
the
two
guards
and
the
train
was
then
backed
into
louis
we
had
only
started
a
quarter
of
an
hour
before
the
police
were
informed
and
they
sent
us
five
detectives
a
goods
train
which
should
have
departed
half
an
hour
before
us
was
sent
on
ahead
of
us
eight
detectives
travelled
on
this
goods
train
and
received
orders
to
get
out
at
the
little
incline
our
giant
was
handed
over
to
the
police
authorities
but
i
was
promised
that
he
should
be
dealt
with
mercifully
on
account
of
the
confession
he
had
made
later
on
i
learnt
that
this
promise
had
been
kept
as
the
man
was
sent
back
to
his
native
country
ireland
from
this
time
forth
my
compartment
was
always
placed
between
two
others
every
night
in
the
i
was
allowed
to
have
my
carriage
at
the
end
on
condition
that
i
would
agree
to
have
on
the
platform
an
armed
detective
whom
i
was
to
pay
by
the
way
for
his
services
our
dinner
was
very
gay
and
every
one
was
rather
excited
as
to
the
guard
who
had
discovered
the
giant
hidden
under
the
train
abbey
and
i
had
rewarded
him
so
lavishly
that
he
was
intoxicated
and
kept
coming
on
every
occasion
to
kiss
my
hand
and
weep
his
tears
repeating
all
the
time
saved
the
french
lady
a
when
finally
we
approached
the
little
incline
it
was
dark
the
wanted
to
rush
along
at
full
speed
but
we
had
not
gone
five
miles
when
crackers
exploded
under
the
wheels
and
we
were
obliged
to
slacken
our
pace
we
wondered
what
new
danger
there
was
awaiting
us
and
we
began
to
feel
anxious
the
women
were
nervous
and
some
of
them
were
in
tears
we
went
along
slowly
peering
into
the
darkness
trying
to
make
out
the
form
of
a
man
or
of
several
men
by
the
light
of
each
cracker
abbey
suggested
going
at
full
speed
because
these
crackers
had
been
placed
along
the
line
by
the
bandits
who
had
probably
thought
of
some
way
of
stopping
the
train
in
case
their
giant
did
not
succeed
in
unhooking
the
carriage
the
refused
to
go
more
quickly
declaring
that
these
crackers
were
signals
placed
there
by
the
railway
company
and
that
he
could
not
risk
every
life
on
a
mere
supposition
the
man
was
quite
right
and
he
was
certainly
very
brave
can
certainly
settle
a
handful
of
ruffians
he
said
i
could
not
answer
for
any
life
if
the
train
went
off
the
lines
clashed
into
or
collided
with
something
or
went
over
a
we
continued
therefore
to
go
slowly
the
lights
had
been
turned
off
in
the
car
so
that
we
might
see
as
much
as
possible
without
being
seen
ourselves
we
had
tried
to
keep
the
truth
from
the
artistes
except
from
three
men
whom
i
had
sent
for
to
my
carriage
the
artistes
really
had
nothing
to
fear
from
the
robbers
as
i
was
the
only
person
at
whom
they
were
aiming
to
avoid
all
unnecessary
questions
and
evasive
answers
we
sent
the
secretary
to
tell
them
that
as
there
was
some
obstruction
on
the
line
the
train
had
to
go
slowly
they
were
also
told
that
one
of
the
had
to
be
repaired
before
we
could
have
the
light
again
the
communication
was
then
cut
between
my
car
and
the
rest
of
the
train
we
had
been
going
along
like
this
for
ten
minutes
perhaps
when
everything
was
suddenly
lighted
up
by
a
fire
and
we
saw
a
gang
of
hastening
towards
us
it
makes
me
shudder
now
when
i
think
how
nearly
these
poor
fellows
escaped
being
killed
our
nerves
had
been
in
such
a
state
of
tension
for
several
hours
that
we
imagined
at
first
that
these
men
were
the
wretched
friends
of
the
giant
some
one
fired
at
them
and
if
it
had
not
been
for
our
plucky
calling
out
to
them
to
stop
with
the
addition
of
a
terrible
oath
two
or
three
of
these
poor
men
would
have
been
wounded
i
too
had
seized
my
revolver
but
before
i
could
have
drawn
out
the
ramrod
which
serves
as
a
cog
to
prevent
it
from
going
off
any
one
would
have
had
time
to
seize
me
bind
me
and
kill
me
a
hundred
times
over
and
still
any
time
i
go
to
a
place
where
i
think
there
is
danger
i
invariably
take
my
pistol
with
me
for
it
is
a
pistol
and
not
a
revolver
i
always
call
it
a
revolver
but
in
reality
it
is
a
pistol
and
a
very
make
too
with
this
ramrod
and
the
trigger
so
hard
to
pull
that
i
have
to
use
my
other
hand
as
well
i
am
not
a
bad
shot
for
a
woman
provided
that
i
may
take
my
time
but
this
is
not
very
easy
when
one
wants
to
fire
at
a
robber
and
yet
i
always
have
my
pistol
with
me
it
is
here
on
my
table
and
i
can
see
it
as
i
write
it
is
in
its
case
which
is
rather
too
narrow
so
that
it
requires
a
certain
amount
of
strength
and
patience
to
pull
it
out
if
an
assassin
should
arrive
at
this
particular
moment
i
should
first
have
to
unfasten
the
case
which
is
not
an
easy
matter
then
to
get
the
pistol
out
pull
out
the
ramrod
which
is
rather
too
firm
and
press
the
trigger
with
both
hands
and
yet
in
spite
of
all
this
the
human
animal
is
so
strange
that
this
ridiculously
useless
little
object
here
before
me
seems
to
me
an
admirable
protection
and
nervous
and
timid
as
i
am
alas
i
feel
quite
safe
when
i
am
near
to
this
little
friend
of
mine
who
must
roar
with
laughter
inside
the
little
case
out
of
which
i
can
scarcely
drag
it
well
everything
was
now
explained
to
us
the
goods
train
which
had
started
before
us
ran
off
the
line
but
no
great
damage
was
done
and
no
one
was
killed
the
louis
band
of
robbers
had
arranged
everything
and
had
prepared
to
have
this
little
accident
two
miles
from
the
little
incline
in
case
their
comrade
crouching
under
my
car
had
not
been
able
to
unhook
it
the
train
had
left
the
rails
but
when
the
wretches
rushed
forward
believing
that
it
was
mine
they
found
themselves
surrounded
by
the
band
of
detectives
it
seems
that
they
fought
like
demons
one
of
them
was
killed
on
the
spot
two
more
wounded
and
the
remainder
taken
prisoners
a
few
days
later
the
chief
of
this
little
band
was
hanged
he
was
a
belgian
named
albert
wirbyn
years
of
age
i
did
all
in
my
power
to
save
him
for
it
seemed
to
me
that
unintentionally
i
had
been
the
instigator
of
his
evil
plan
if
abbey
and
jarrett
had
not
been
so
rabid
for
advertisement
if
they
had
not
added
more
than
six
hundred
thousand
worth
of
jewellery
to
mine
this
man
this
wretched
youth
would
not
perhaps
have
had
the
stupid
idea
of
robbing
me
who
can
say
what
schemes
had
floated
through
the
mind
of
the
poor
fellow
who
was
perhaps
or
perhaps
excited
by
a
clever
inventive
brain
perhaps
when
he
stopped
and
looked
at
the
window
he
said
to
himself
is
jewellery
there
worth
a
million
francs
if
it
were
all
mine
i
would
sell
it
and
go
back
to
belgium
what
joy
i
could
give
to
my
poor
mother
who
is
blinding
herself
with
work
by
gaslight
and
i
could
help
my
sister
to
get
or
perhaps
he
was
an
inventor
and
he
thought
to
himself
if
only
i
had
the
money
which
that
jewellery
represents
i
could
bring
out
my
invention
myself
instead
of
selling
my
patent
to
some
highly
esteemed
rascal
who
will
buy
it
from
me
for
a
crust
of
bread
what
would
it
matter
to
the
artiste
ah
if
only
i
had
the
money
ah
if
i
had
the
money
perhaps
the
poor
fellow
cried
with
rage
to
think
of
all
this
wealth
belonging
to
one
person
perhaps
the
idea
of
crime
germinated
in
this
way
in
a
mind
which
had
hitherto
been
pure
ah
who
can
tell
to
what
hope
may
give
birth
in
a
young
mind
at
first
it
may
be
only
a
beautiful
dream
but
this
may
end
in
a
mad
desire
to
realise
the
dream
to
steal
the
goods
of
another
person
is
certainly
not
right
but
this
should
not
be
punished
by
death
it
certainly
should
not
to
kill
a
man
of
years
of
age
is
a
much
greater
crime
than
to
steal
jewellery
even
by
force
and
a
society
which
bands
together
in
order
to
wield
the
sword
of
justice
is
much
more
cowardly
when
it
kills
than
the
man
who
robs
and
kills
quite
alone
at
his
own
risk
and
peril
oh
what
tears
i
wept
for
that
man
whom
i
did
not
know
at
all
who
was
a
rascal
or
perhaps
a
hero
he
was
perhaps
a
man
of
weak
intellect
who
had
turned
thief
but
he
was
only
years
of
age
and
he
had
a
right
to
live
how
i
hate
capital
punishment
it
is
a
relic
of
cowardly
barbarism
and
it
is
a
disgrace
for
civilised
countries
still
to
have
their
guillotines
and
scaffolds
every
human
being
has
a
moment
when
his
heart
is
easily
touched
when
the
tears
of
grief
will
flow
and
those
tears
may
fecundate
a
generous
thought
which
might
lead
to
repentance
i
would
not
for
the
whole
world
be
one
of
those
who
condemn
a
man
to
death
and
yet
many
of
them
are
good
upright
men
who
when
they
return
to
their
families
are
affectionate
to
their
wives
and
reprove
their
children
for
breaking
a
head
i
have
seen
four
executions
one
in
london
one
in
spain
and
two
in
paris
in
london
the
method
is
hanging
and
this
seems
to
me
more
hideous
more
repugnant
more
weird
than
any
other
death
the
victim
was
a
young
man
of
about
thirty
with
a
strong
looking
face
i
only
saw
him
a
second
and
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
as
he
glanced
at
me
his
eyes
expressing
his
contempt
for
my
curiosity
at
that
moment
i
felt
that
ideas
were
very
much
superior
to
mine
and
the
condemned
man
seemed
to
me
greater
than
all
who
were
there
it
was
perhaps
because
he
was
nearer
than
we
all
were
to
the
great
mystery
i
can
see
him
now
smile
as
they
covered
his
face
with
the
hood
while
as
for
me
i
rushed
away
completely
upset
in
madrid
i
saw
a
man
garrotted
and
the
barbarity
of
this
torture
terrified
me
for
weeks
after
he
was
accused
of
having
killed
his
mother
but
no
real
proof
seemed
to
have
been
brought
forward
against
the
wretched
man
and
he
cried
out
when
they
were
holding
him
down
on
his
seat
before
putting
the
garrotte
on
him
i
shall
soon
be
with
you
and
you
will
tell
them
all
in
my
presence
that
they
have
these
words
were
uttered
in
spanish
in
a
voice
that
vibrated
with
earnestness
they
were
translated
for
me
by
an
to
the
british
embassy
with
whom
i
had
gone
to
see
the
hideous
sight
the
wretched
man
cried
out
in
such
a
sincere
tone
of
voice
that
it
was
impossible
for
him
not
to
have
been
innocent
and
this
was
the
opinion
of
all
those
who
were
with
me
the
two
other
executions
which
i
witnessed
were
at
the
place
de
la
roquette
paris
the
first
was
that
of
a
young
medical
student
who
with
the
help
of
one
of
his
friends
had
killed
an
old
woman
who
sold
newspapers
it
was
a
stupid
odious
crime
but
the
man
was
more
mad
than
criminal
he
was
more
than
ordinarily
intelligent
and
had
passed
his
examinations
at
an
earlier
age
than
is
usual
he
had
worked
too
hard
and
it
had
affected
his
brain
he
ought
to
have
been
allowed
to
rest
to
have
been
treated
as
an
invalid
cured
in
mind
and
body
and
then
returned
to
his
scientific
pursuits
he
was
a
young
man
quite
above
the
average
as
regards
intellect
i
can
see
him
now
pale
and
haggard
with
a
dreamy
look
in
his
eyes
an
expression
of
infinite
sadness
i
know
of
course
that
he
had
killed
a
poor
defenceless
old
woman
that
was
certainly
odious
but
he
was
only
years
old
and
his
mind
was
disordered
through
study
and
overwork
too
much
ambition
and
the
habit
of
cutting
off
arms
and
legs
and
dissecting
the
dead
bodies
of
women
and
children
all
this
does
not
excuse
the
abominable
deed
but
it
had
all
contributed
to
unhinge
his
moral
sense
which
was
perhaps
already
in
a
wavering
state
thanks
to
study
poverty
or
atavism
i
consider
that
a
crime
of
high
treason
against
humanity
was
committed
in
taking
the
life
of
a
man
of
intellect
who
when
once
he
had
recovered
his
reason
might
have
rendered
great
service
to
science
and
to
humanity
the
last
execution
at
which
i
was
present
was
that
of
vaillant
the
anarchist
he
was
an
energetic
man
and
at
the
same
time
mild
and
gentle
with
very
advanced
ideas
but
not
much
more
advanced
than
those
of
men
who
have
since
risen
to
power
my
theatre
at
that
time
was
the
renaissance
and
he
often
applied
to
me
for
free
seats
as
he
was
too
poor
to
pay
for
the
luxuries
of
art
ah
poverty
what
a
sorry
counsellor
art
thou
and
how
tolerant
we
ought
to
be
to
those
who
have
to
endure
misery
one
day
vaillant
came
to
see
me
in
my
at
the
theatre
i
was
playing
lorenzaccio
and
he
said
to
me
that
florentine
was
an
anarchist
just
as
i
am
but
he
killed
the
tyrant
and
not
tyranny
that
is
not
the
way
i
shall
go
to
a
few
days
later
he
threw
a
bomb
in
a
public
building
the
chamber
of
deputies
the
poor
fellow
was
not
as
successful
as
the
florentine
whom
he
seemed
to
despise
for
he
did
not
kill
any
one
and
did
no
real
harm
except
to
his
own
cause
i
said
i
should
like
to
know
when
he
was
to
be
executed
and
the
night
before
a
friend
of
mine
came
to
the
theatre
and
told
me
that
the
execution
was
to
take
place
the
following
day
monday
at
seven
in
the
morning
i
started
after
the
performance
and
went
to
the
rue
merlin
at
the
corner
of
the
rue
de
la
roquette
the
streets
were
still
very
animated
as
that
sunday
was
dimanche
gras
shrove
sunday
people
were
singing
laughing
and
dancing
everywhere
i
waited
all
night
and
as
i
was
not
allowed
to
enter
the
prison
i
sat
on
the
balcony
of
a
first
floor
flat
which
i
had
engaged
the
cold
darkness
of
the
night
in
its
immensity
seemed
to
enwrap
me
in
sadness
i
did
not
feel
the
cold
for
my
blood
was
flowing
rapidly
through
my
veins
the
hours
passed
slowly
the
hours
which
rang
out
in
the
distance
est
morte
vive
i
heard
a
vague
muffled
sound
of
footsteps
whispering
and
of
wood
which
creaked
heavily
but
i
did
not
know
what
these
strange
mysterious
sounds
were
until
day
began
to
break
i
saw
that
the
scaffold
was
there
a
man
came
to
extinguish
the
lamps
on
the
place
de
la
roquette
and
an
sky
spread
its
pale
light
over
us
the
crowd
began
to
collect
gradually
but
remained
in
compact
groups
and
circulation
in
the
streets
was
interrupted
every
now
and
then
a
man
looking
quite
indifferent
but
evidently
in
a
hurry
pushed
aside
the
crowd
presented
a
card
to
a
policeman
and
then
disappeared
under
the
porch
of
the
prison
i
counted
more
than
ten
of
these
men
they
were
journalists
presently
the
military
guard
appeared
suddenly
on
the
spot
and
took
up
its
position
around
the
pedestal
the
usual
number
of
the
guard
had
been
doubled
for
this
occasion
as
some
anarchist
plot
was
feared
on
a
given
signal
swords
were
drawn
and
the
prison
door
opened
vaillant
appeared
looking
very
pale
but
energetic
and
brave
he
cried
out
in
a
manly
voice
with
perfect
assurance
there
was
not
a
single
cry
in
response
to
his
he
was
seized
and
thrown
back
over
the
slab
the
knife
fell
with
a
muffled
sound
the
body
tottered
and
in
a
second
the
scaffold
was
taken
away
the
place
swept
the
crowds
were
allowed
to
move
they
rushed
forward
to
the
place
of
execution
gazing
down
on
the
ground
for
a
spot
of
blood
which
was
not
to
be
seen
sniffing
in
the
air
for
any
odour
of
the
drama
which
had
just
been
enacted
there
were
women
children
old
men
all
joking
there
on
the
very
spot
where
a
man
had
just
expired
in
the
most
supreme
agony
and
that
man
had
made
himself
the
apostle
of
this
populace
that
man
had
claimed
for
this
teeming
crowd
all
kinds
of
liberties
all
kinds
of
privileges
and
rights
i
was
thickly
veiled
so
that
i
could
not
be
recognised
and
accompanied
by
a
friend
as
escort
i
mingled
with
the
crowd
and
it
made
me
sick
at
heart
and
desperate
there
was
not
a
word
of
gratitude
to
this
man
not
a
murmur
of
vengeance
nor
of
revolt
i
felt
inclined
to
cry
out
that
you
are
kneel
down
and
kiss
the
stones
that
the
blood
of
this
poor
madman
has
stained
for
your
sakes
for
you
because
he
believed
in
but
before
i
had
time
for
this
a
street
urchin
was
calling
out
the
last
moments
of
vaillant
buy
buy
oh
poor
vaillant
his
headless
body
was
then
being
taken
to
clamart
and
the
crowds
for
whom
he
had
wept
worked
and
died
were
now
going
quietly
away
indifferent
and
bored
poor
vaillant
his
ideas
were
exaggerated
ones
but
they
were
generous
xxxvii
new
orleans
and
other
american
cities
a
visit
to
the
falls
of
niagara
we
arrived
at
cincinnati
safe
and
sound
we
gave
three
performances
there
and
set
off
once
more
for
new
orleans
now
i
thought
we
shall
have
some
sunshine
and
we
shall
be
able
to
warm
our
poor
limbs
which
were
stiffened
with
three
months
of
mortal
cold
we
shall
be
able
to
open
our
windows
and
breathe
fresh
air
instead
of
the
suffocating
and
steam
heat
i
fell
asleep
and
dreams
of
warmth
and
sweet
scents
lulled
me
in
my
slumber
a
knock
roused
me
suddenly
and
my
dog
with
ears
erect
sniffed
at
the
door
but
as
he
did
not
growl
i
knew
it
was
some
one
of
our
party
i
opened
the
door
and
jarrett
followed
by
abbey
made
signs
to
me
not
to
speak
jarrett
came
in
on
and
closed
the
door
again
what
is
it
now
i
asked
replied
jarrett
incessant
rain
during
the
last
twelve
days
has
swollen
the
water
to
such
a
height
that
the
bridge
of
boats
across
the
bay
here
is
liable
to
give
way
under
the
terrible
pressure
of
the
water
do
you
hear
the
awful
storm
of
wind
that
is
now
blowing
if
we
go
back
by
the
other
route
it
will
require
three
or
four
i
was
furious
three
or
four
days
and
to
go
back
to
the
snow
again
ah
no
i
felt
i
must
have
sunshine
can
we
not
pass
oh
heavens
what
shall
we
do
i
exclaimed
the
is
here
he
thinks
that
he
might
get
across
but
he
has
only
just
married
and
he
will
try
the
crossing
on
condition
that
you
give
him
two
thousand
five
hundred
dollars
which
he
will
at
once
send
to
mobile
where
his
father
and
wife
live
if
we
get
safely
to
the
other
side
he
will
give
you
back
this
money
but
if
not
it
will
belong
to
his
i
must
confess
that
i
was
stupefied
with
admiration
for
this
plucky
man
his
daring
excited
me
and
i
exclaimed
certainly
give
him
the
money
and
let
us
as
i
have
said
i
generally
travelled
by
special
train
this
one
was
made
up
of
only
three
carriages
and
the
engine
i
never
doubted
for
a
moment
as
to
the
success
of
this
foolish
and
criminal
attempt
and
i
did
not
tell
any
one
about
it
except
my
sister
my
beloved
guérard
and
my
faithful
félicie
and
her
husband
claude
the
comedian
angelo
who
was
sleeping
in
berth
on
this
journey
knew
of
it
but
he
was
courageous
and
had
faith
in
his
star
the
money
was
handed
over
to
the
who
sent
it
off
to
mobile
it
was
only
just
as
we
were
actually
starting
that
i
had
the
vision
of
the
responsibility
i
had
taken
upon
myself
for
it
was
risking
without
their
consent
the
lives
of
persons
it
was
too
late
then
to
do
anything
the
train
had
started
and
at
a
terrific
speed
it
touched
the
bridge
of
boats
i
had
taken
my
seat
on
the
platform
and
the
bridge
bent
and
swayed
like
a
hammock
under
the
dizzy
speed
of
our
wild
course
when
we
were
half
way
across
it
gave
way
so
much
that
my
sister
grasped
my
arm
and
whispered
we
are
drowning
she
closed
her
eyes
and
clutched
me
nervously
but
was
quite
brave
i
certainly
imagined
as
she
did
that
the
supreme
moment
had
arrived
and
abominable
as
it
was
i
never
for
a
second
thought
of
all
those
who
were
full
of
confidence
and
life
whom
i
was
sacrificing
whom
i
was
killing
my
only
thought
was
of
a
dear
little
face
which
would
soon
be
in
mourning
for
me
and
to
think
that
we
take
about
within
us
our
most
terrible
enemy
thought
and
that
it
is
continually
at
variance
with
our
deeds
it
rises
up
at
times
terrible
perfidious
and
we
try
to
drive
it
away
without
success
we
do
not
thanks
to
god
invariably
obey
it
but
it
pursues
us
torments
us
makes
us
suffer
how
often
the
most
evil
thoughts
assail
us
and
what
battles
we
have
to
fight
in
order
to
drive
away
these
children
of
our
brain
anger
ambition
revenge
give
birth
to
the
most
detestable
thoughts
which
make
us
blush
with
shame
as
we
should
at
some
horrible
blemish
and
yet
they
are
not
ours
for
we
have
not
evoked
them
but
they
defile
us
nevertheless
and
leave
us
in
despair
at
not
being
masters
of
our
own
heart
mind
and
body
my
last
minute
was
not
inscribed
though
for
that
day
in
the
book
of
destiny
the
train
pulled
itself
together
and
half
leaping
and
half
rolling
along
we
arrived
on
the
other
side
of
the
water
behind
us
we
heard
a
terrible
noise
a
column
of
water
falling
back
like
a
huge
sheaf
the
bridge
had
given
way
for
more
than
a
week
the
trains
from
the
east
and
the
north
could
not
run
over
this
route
i
left
the
money
to
our
brave
but
my
conscience
was
by
no
means
tranquil
and
for
a
long
time
my
sleep
was
disturbed
by
the
most
frightful
nightmares
and
when
any
of
the
artistes
spoke
to
me
of
their
child
their
mother
or
their
husband
whom
they
longed
to
see
once
more
i
felt
myself
turn
pale
a
thrill
of
deep
emotion
went
through
me
and
i
had
the
deepest
pity
for
my
own
self
when
getting
out
of
the
train
i
was
more
dead
than
alive
from
retrospective
emotion
i
had
to
submit
to
receiving
a
most
friendly
though
fatiguing
deputation
of
my
compatriots
then
loaded
with
flowers
i
climbed
into
the
carriage
that
was
to
take
me
to
the
hotel
the
roads
were
rivers
and
we
were
on
an
elevated
spot
the
lower
part
of
the
city
the
coachman
explained
to
us
in
french
with
a
strong
marseilles
accent
was
inundated
up
to
the
tops
of
the
houses
hundreds
of
negroes
had
been
drowned
he
cried
as
he
whipped
up
his
horses
at
that
period
the
hotels
in
new
orleans
were
squalid
dirty
uncomfortable
black
with
cockroaches
and
as
soon
as
the
candles
were
lighted
the
bedrooms
became
filled
with
large
mosquitoes
that
buzzed
round
and
fell
on
shoulder
sticking
in
hair
oh
i
shudder
still
when
i
think
of
it
at
the
same
time
as
our
company
there
was
at
new
orleans
an
opera
company
the
of
which
was
a
charming
woman
emilie
ambre
who
at
one
time
came
very
near
being
queen
of
holland
the
country
was
poor
like
all
the
other
american
districts
where
the
french
were
to
be
found
preponderating
the
opera
did
very
poor
business
and
we
did
not
do
excellently
either
six
performances
would
have
been
ample
in
that
city
we
gave
eight
nevertheless
my
sojourn
pleased
me
immensely
an
infinite
charm
was
evolved
from
it
all
these
people
so
different
black
and
white
had
smiling
faces
all
the
women
were
graceful
the
shops
were
attractive
from
the
cheerfulness
of
their
windows
the
traders
under
the
arcades
challenged
one
another
with
joyful
flashes
of
wit
the
sun
however
did
not
show
itself
once
but
these
people
had
the
sun
within
themselves
i
could
not
understand
why
boats
were
not
used
the
horses
had
water
up
to
their
hams
and
it
would
have
been
impossible
even
to
get
into
a
carriage
if
the
pavements
had
not
been
a
metre
high
and
occasionally
more
floods
being
as
frequent
as
the
years
it
would
be
of
no
use
to
think
of
banking
up
the
river
or
arm
of
the
sea
but
circulation
was
made
easy
by
the
high
pavements
and
small
movable
bridges
the
dark
children
amused
themselves
catching
crayfish
in
the
streams
where
did
they
come
from
and
they
sold
them
to
now
and
again
we
would
see
a
whole
family
of
water
serpents
speed
by
they
swept
along
with
raised
head
and
undulating
body
like
long
starry
sapphires
i
went
down
towards
the
lower
part
of
the
town
the
sight
was
heartrending
all
the
cabins
of
the
coloured
inhabitants
had
fallen
into
the
muddy
waters
they
were
there
in
hundreds
squatting
upon
these
moving
wrecks
with
eyes
burning
from
fever
their
white
teeth
chattered
with
hunger
right
and
left
everywhere
were
dead
bodies
with
swollen
stomachs
floating
about
knocking
up
against
the
wooden
piles
many
ladies
were
distributing
food
endeavouring
to
lead
away
these
unfortunate
creatures
no
they
would
stay
where
they
were
with
a
blissful
smile
they
would
reply
water
go
away
house
be
found
me
begin
and
the
women
would
slowly
nod
their
heads
in
token
of
assent
several
alligators
had
shown
themselves
brought
up
by
the
tide
two
children
had
disappeared
one
child
of
fourteen
years
of
age
had
just
been
carried
off
to
the
hospital
with
his
foot
cut
clean
off
at
the
ankle
by
one
of
these
marine
monsters
his
family
were
howling
with
fury
they
wished
to
keep
the
youngster
with
them
the
negro
quack
doctor
pretended
that
he
could
have
cured
him
in
two
days
and
that
the
white
would
leave
him
for
a
month
in
bed
i
left
this
city
with
regret
for
it
resembled
no
other
city
i
had
visited
up
to
then
we
were
really
surprised
to
find
that
none
of
our
party
were
missing
they
had
gone
through
so
they
said
various
dangers
the
alone
a
man
called
ibé
could
not
recover
his
equilibrium
having
become
half
mad
from
fear
the
second
day
of
our
arrival
at
the
theatre
he
generally
slept
in
the
trunk
in
which
he
stored
his
wigs
however
strange
it
may
seem
the
fact
is
quite
true
the
first
night
everything
passed
off
as
usual
but
during
the
second
night
he
woke
up
the
whole
neighbourhood
by
his
shrieks
the
unfortunate
fellow
had
got
off
soundly
to
sleep
when
he
woke
up
with
a
feeling
that
his
mattress
which
lay
suspended
over
his
collection
of
wigs
was
being
raised
by
some
inconceivable
movements
he
thought
that
some
cat
or
dog
had
got
into
the
trunk
and
he
lifted
up
the
feeble
rampart
two
serpents
were
either
quarrelling
or
making
love
to
each
other
he
could
not
say
which
two
serpents
of
a
size
sufficient
to
terrify
the
people
whom
the
shouts
of
the
poor
figaro
had
caused
to
gather
round
he
was
still
very
pale
when
i
saw
him
embark
on
board
the
boat
that
was
to
take
us
to
our
train
i
called
him
and
begged
he
would
relate
to
me
the
odyssey
of
his
terrible
night
as
he
told
me
the
story
he
pointed
to
his
big
leg
were
as
thick
as
that
madame
yes
like
that
and
he
quaked
with
fear
as
he
recalled
the
dreadful
girth
of
the
reptiles
i
thought
that
they
were
about
one
quarter
as
thick
as
his
leg
and
that
would
have
been
enough
to
justify
his
fright
for
the
serpents
in
question
were
not
inoffensive
that
bite
out
of
pure
viciousness
but
have
no
venom
fangs
we
reached
mobile
somewhat
late
in
the
day
we
had
stopped
at
that
city
on
our
way
to
new
orleans
and
i
had
had
a
real
attack
of
nerves
caused
by
the
of
the
inhabitants
who
in
spite
of
the
lateness
of
the
hour
had
got
up
a
deputation
to
wait
upon
me
i
was
dead
with
fatigue
and
was
dropping
off
to
sleep
in
my
bed
in
the
car
i
therefore
energetically
declined
to
see
anybody
but
these
people
knocked
at
my
windows
sang
round
about
my
carriage
and
finally
exasperated
me
i
quickly
threw
up
one
of
the
windows
and
emptied
a
jug
of
water
on
their
heads
women
and
men
amongst
whom
were
several
journalists
were
inundated
their
fury
was
great
i
was
returning
to
that
city
preceded
by
the
above
story
embellished
in
their
favour
by
the
drenched
reporters
but
on
the
other
hand
there
were
others
who
had
been
more
courteous
and
had
refused
to
go
and
disturb
a
lady
at
such
an
unearthly
hour
of
the
night
these
latter
were
in
the
majority
and
took
up
my
defence
it
was
therefore
in
this
warlike
atmosphere
that
i
appeared
before
the
public
of
mobile
i
wanted
however
to
justify
the
good
opinion
of
my
defenders
and
confound
my
detractors
yes
but
a
sprite
who
had
decided
otherwise
was
there
mobile
was
a
city
that
was
generally
quite
disdained
by
there
was
only
one
theatre
it
had
been
let
to
the
tragedian
barrett
who
was
to
appear
six
days
after
me
all
that
remained
was
a
miserable
place
so
small
that
i
know
of
nothing
that
can
be
compared
to
it
we
were
playing
dame
aux
when
marguerite
gautier
orders
supper
to
be
served
the
servants
who
were
to
bring
in
the
table
ready
laid
tried
to
get
it
in
through
the
door
but
this
was
impossible
nothing
could
be
more
comical
than
to
see
those
unfortunate
servants
adopt
every
expedient
the
public
laughed
among
the
laughter
of
the
spectators
was
one
that
became
contagious
a
negro
of
twelve
or
fifteen
who
had
got
in
somehow
was
standing
on
a
chair
and
with
his
two
hands
holding
on
to
his
knees
his
body
bent
head
forward
mouth
open
he
was
laughing
with
such
a
shrill
and
piercing
tone
and
with
such
even
continuity
that
i
caught
it
too
i
had
to
go
out
while
a
portion
of
the
back
scenery
was
being
removed
to
allow
the
table
to
be
brought
in
i
returned
somewhat
composed
but
still
under
the
domination
of
suppressed
laughter
we
were
sitting
round
the
table
and
the
supper
was
drawing
to
a
close
as
usual
but
just
as
the
servants
were
entering
to
remove
the
table
one
of
them
caught
the
scenery
which
had
been
badly
adjusted
by
the
in
their
haste
and
the
whole
back
scene
fell
on
our
heads
as
the
scenery
was
nearly
all
made
of
paper
in
those
days
it
did
not
fall
on
our
heads
and
remain
there
but
round
our
necks
and
we
had
to
remain
in
that
position
without
being
able
to
move
our
heads
having
gone
through
the
paper
our
appearance
was
most
comical
and
ridiculous
the
young
laughter
started
again
more
piercing
than
ever
and
this
time
my
suppressed
laughter
ended
in
a
crisis
that
left
me
without
any
strength
the
money
paid
for
admission
was
returned
to
the
public
it
exceeded
fifteen
thousand
francs
this
city
was
an
unlucky
one
for
me
and
came
very
near
proving
fatal
during
the
third
visit
i
paid
to
it
as
i
will
narrate
in
the
second
volume
of
these
memoirs
that
very
night
we
left
mobile
for
atlanta
where
after
playing
dame
aux
we
left
again
the
same
evening
for
nashville
we
stayed
an
entire
day
at
memphis
and
gave
two
performances
there
at
one
in
the
morning
we
left
for
louisville
during
the
journey
from
memphis
to
louisville
we
were
awakened
by
the
sound
of
a
fight
by
oaths
and
cries
i
opened
the
door
of
my
railway
carriage
and
recognised
the
voices
jarrett
came
out
at
the
same
time
we
went
towards
the
spot
whence
the
noise
came
to
the
small
platform
where
the
two
combatants
captain
hayné
and
marcus
mayer
were
fighting
with
revolvers
in
their
hands
marcus
eye
was
out
of
its
orbit
and
blood
covered
the
face
of
captain
hayné
i
threw
myself
without
a
reflection
between
the
two
madmen
who
with
that
brutal
but
delightful
courtesy
of
north
americans
stopped
their
fight
we
were
beginning
the
dizzy
round
of
the
smaller
towns
arriving
at
three
four
and
sometimes
six
in
the
evening
and
leaving
immediately
after
the
play
i
only
left
my
car
to
go
to
the
theatre
and
returned
as
soon
as
the
play
was
over
to
retire
to
my
elegant
but
diminutive
bedroom
i
sleep
well
on
the
railway
i
felt
an
immense
pleasure
travelling
in
that
way
at
high
speed
sitting
outside
on
the
small
platform
or
rather
reclining
in
a
gazing
on
the
spectacle
of
american
plains
and
forests
that
passed
before
me
without
stopping
we
went
through
louisville
cincinnati
for
the
second
time
columbus
dayton
indianapolis
joseph
where
one
gets
the
best
beer
in
the
world
and
where
when
i
was
obliged
to
go
to
an
hotel
on
account
of
repairs
to
one
of
the
wheels
of
the
car
a
drunken
dancer
at
a
big
ball
given
in
the
hotel
seized
me
in
the
corridor
leading
to
my
room
this
brutal
fellow
caught
hold
of
me
just
as
i
was
getting
out
of
the
elevator
and
dragged
me
off
with
cries
like
those
of
a
wild
animal
finding
its
prey
after
five
days
of
enforced
hunger
my
dog
mad
with
excitement
on
hearing
me
scream
bit
his
legs
severely
and
that
aroused
the
drunken
man
to
the
point
of
fury
it
was
with
the
greatest
difficulty
that
i
was
delivered
from
the
clutches
of
this
demoniac
supper
was
served
what
a
supper
fortunately
the
beer
was
light
both
in
colour
and
consistency
and
enabled
me
to
swallow
the
dreadful
things
that
were
served
up
the
ball
lasted
all
night
accompanied
by
revolver
shots
we
left
for
leavenworth
quincy
springfield
but
not
the
springfield
in
massachusetts
the
one
in
illinois
during
the
journey
from
springfield
to
chicago
we
were
stopped
by
the
snow
in
the
middle
of
the
night
the
sharp
and
deep
groanings
of
the
locomotive
had
already
awakened
me
i
summoned
my
faithful
claude
and
learned
that
we
were
to
stop
and
wait
for
help
aided
by
my
félicie
i
dressed
in
haste
and
tried
to
descend
but
it
was
impossible
the
snow
was
as
high
as
the
platform
of
the
car
i
remained
wrapped
up
in
furs
contemplating
the
magnificent
night
the
sky
was
hard
implacable
without
a
star
but
all
the
same
translucid
lights
extended
as
far
as
the
eye
could
see
along
the
rails
before
me
for
i
had
taken
refuge
on
the
rear
platform
these
lights
were
to
warn
the
trains
that
followed
four
of
these
came
up
and
stopped
when
the
first
went
off
beneath
their
wheels
then
crept
slowly
forward
to
the
first
light
where
a
man
who
was
stationed
there
explained
the
incident
the
same
lights
were
lit
immediately
for
the
following
train
as
far
off
as
possible
and
a
man
proceeding
beyond
the
lights
placed
detonators
on
the
metals
each
train
that
arrived
followed
that
course
we
were
blocked
by
the
snow
the
idea
came
to
me
of
lighting
the
kitchen
fire
and
i
thus
got
sufficient
boiling
water
to
melt
the
top
coating
of
snow
on
the
side
where
i
wanted
to
alight
having
done
this
claude
and
our
coloured
servants
got
down
and
cleared
away
a
small
portion
as
well
as
they
could
i
was
at
last
able
to
descend
myself
and
i
tried
to
remove
the
snow
to
one
side
my
sister
and
i
finished
by
throwing
snowballs
at
each
other
and
the
became
general
abbey
jarrett
the
secretary
and
several
of
the
artistes
joined
in
and
we
were
warmed
by
this
small
battle
with
white
when
dawn
appeared
we
were
to
be
seen
firing
a
revolver
and
colt
rifle
at
a
target
made
from
a
champagne
case
a
distant
sound
deadened
by
the
of
the
snow
at
length
made
us
realise
that
help
was
approaching
as
a
matter
of
fact
two
engines
with
men
who
had
shovels
hooks
and
spades
were
coming
at
full
speed
from
the
opposite
direction
they
were
obliged
to
slow
down
on
getting
to
within
one
kilometre
of
where
we
were
and
the
men
began
clearing
the
way
before
them
they
finally
succeeded
in
reaching
us
but
we
were
obliged
to
go
back
and
take
the
western
route
the
unfortunate
artistes
who
had
counted
on
getting
breakfast
in
chicago
which
we
ought
to
have
reached
at
eleven
were
lamenting
for
with
the
new
itinerary
that
we
were
forced
to
follow
we
could
not
reach
milwaukee
before
one
there
we
were
to
give
a
at
two
dame
aux
i
therefore
had
the
best
lunch
i
could
get
prepared
and
my
servants
carried
it
to
my
company
the
members
of
which
showed
themselves
very
grateful
the
performance
only
began
at
three
and
finished
at
six
we
started
again
at
eight
with
immediately
after
the
play
we
left
for
grand
rapids
detroit
cleveland
and
pittsburg
in
which
latter
city
i
was
to
meet
an
american
friend
of
mine
who
was
to
help
me
to
realise
one
of
my
dreams
at
least
i
fancied
so
in
partnership
with
his
brother
my
friend
was
the
owner
of
large
steel
works
and
several
petroleum
wells
i
had
known
him
in
paris
and
had
met
him
again
at
new
york
where
he
offered
to
conduct
me
to
buffalo
so
that
i
could
visit
or
rather
he
could
initiate
me
into
the
falls
of
niagara
for
which
he
entertained
a
passion
frequently
he
would
start
off
quite
unexpectedly
like
a
madman
and
take
a
rest
at
a
place
just
near
the
niagara
falls
the
deafening
sound
of
the
cataracts
seemed
like
music
after
the
hard
hammering
strident
noise
of
the
forges
at
work
on
the
iron
and
the
limpidity
of
the
silvery
cascades
rested
his
eyes
and
refreshed
his
lungs
saturated
as
they
were
with
petroleum
and
smoke
my
buggy
drawn
by
two
magnificent
horses
took
us
along
in
a
bewildering
whirlwind
of
mud
splashing
over
us
and
snow
blinding
us
it
had
been
raining
for
a
week
and
pittsburg
in
was
not
what
it
is
at
present
although
it
was
a
city
which
impressed
one
on
account
of
its
commercial
genius
the
black
mud
ran
along
the
streets
and
everywhere
in
the
sky
rose
huge
patches
of
thick
black
opaque
smoke
but
there
was
a
certain
grandeur
about
it
all
for
work
was
king
there
trains
ran
through
the
streets
laden
with
barrels
of
petroleum
or
piled
as
high
as
possible
with
charcoal
and
coal
that
fine
river
the
ohio
carried
along
with
it
steamers
barges
loads
of
timber
fastened
together
and
forming
enormous
rafts
which
floated
down
the
river
alone
to
be
stopped
on
the
way
by
the
owner
for
whom
they
were
destined
the
timber
is
marked
and
no
one
else
thinks
of
taking
it
i
am
told
that
the
wood
is
not
conveyed
in
this
way
now
which
is
a
pity
the
carriage
took
us
along
through
streets
and
squares
in
the
midst
of
railways
under
the
enervating
vibration
of
the
electric
wires
which
ran
like
furrows
across
the
sky
we
crossed
a
bridge
which
shook
under
the
light
weight
of
the
buggy
it
was
a
suspension
bridge
finally
we
drew
up
at
my
home
he
introduced
his
brother
to
me
a
charming
man
but
very
cold
and
correct
and
so
quiet
that
i
was
astonished
poor
brother
is
deaf
said
my
companion
after
i
had
been
exerting
myself
for
five
minutes
to
talk
to
him
in
my
gentlest
voice
i
looked
at
this
poor
millionaire
who
was
living
in
the
most
extraordinary
noise
and
who
could
not
hear
even
the
faintest
echo
of
the
outrageous
uproar
he
could
not
hear
anything
at
all
and
i
wondered
whether
he
was
to
be
envied
or
pitied
i
was
then
taken
to
visit
his
incandescent
ovens
and
his
vats
in
a
state
of
ebullition
i
went
into
a
room
where
some
steel
discs
were
cooling
which
looked
like
so
many
setting
suns
the
heat
from
them
seemed
to
scorch
my
lungs
and
i
felt
as
though
my
hair
would
take
fire
we
then
went
down
a
long
narrow
road
through
which
small
trains
were
running
to
and
fro
some
of
those
trains
were
laden
with
incandescent
metals
which
made
the
atmosphere
iridescent
as
they
passed
we
walked
in
single
file
along
the
narrow
passage
reserved
for
foot
passengers
between
the
rails
i
did
not
feel
at
all
safe
and
my
heart
began
to
beat
fast
blown
first
one
way
then
the
other
by
the
wind
from
the
two
trains
coming
in
opposite
directions
and
passing
each
other
i
drew
my
skirts
closely
round
me
so
that
they
should
not
be
caught
perched
on
my
high
heels
at
every
step
i
took
i
was
afraid
of
slipping
on
this
narrow
greasy
pavement
to
sum
up
briefly
it
was
a
very
unpleasant
moment
and
very
delighted
i
was
to
come
to
the
end
of
that
interminable
street
which
led
to
an
enormous
field
stretching
away
as
far
as
the
eye
could
see
there
were
rails
lying
all
about
here
which
men
were
polishing
and
filing
i
had
had
quite
enough
though
and
i
asked
to
be
allowed
to
go
back
and
rest
so
we
all
three
returned
to
the
house
on
arriving
there
valets
arrayed
in
livery
opened
the
doors
took
our
furs
walking
on
as
they
moved
about
there
was
silence
everywhere
and
i
wondered
why
as
it
seemed
to
me
incomprehensible
my
brother
scarcely
spoke
at
all
and
when
he
did
his
voice
was
so
low
that
i
had
great
difficulty
in
understanding
him
when
we
asked
him
any
question
by
gesticulating
we
had
to
listen
most
attentively
to
catch
his
reply
and
i
noticed
that
an
almost
imperceptible
smile
lighted
up
for
an
instant
his
stony
face
i
understood
very
soon
that
this
man
hated
humanity
and
that
he
avenged
himself
in
his
own
way
for
his
infirmity
lunch
had
been
prepared
for
us
in
the
winter
conservatory
a
nook
of
magnificent
verdure
and
flowers
we
had
just
taken
our
seats
at
the
table
when
the
songs
of
a
thousand
birds
burst
forth
like
a
veritable
fanfare
underneath
some
large
leaves
whole
families
of
canaries
were
imprisoned
by
invisible
nets
they
were
everywhere
up
in
the
air
down
below
under
my
chair
on
the
table
behind
me
all
over
the
place
i
tried
to
quiet
this
shrill
uproar
by
shaking
my
napkin
and
speaking
in
a
loud
voice
but
the
little
feathered
tribe
began
to
sing
in
a
maddening
way
the
deaf
man
was
leaning
back
in
a
and
i
noticed
that
his
face
had
lighted
up
he
laughed
aloud
in
an
evil
spiteful
manner
just
as
my
own
temper
was
getting
the
better
of
me
a
feeling
of
pity
and
indulgence
came
into
my
heart
for
this
man
whose
vengeance
seemed
to
me
as
pathetic
as
it
was
puerile
promptly
deciding
to
make
the
best
of
my
spitefulness
and
assisted
by
his
brother
i
took
my
tea
into
the
hall
at
the
other
end
of
the
conservatory
i
was
nearly
dead
with
fatigue
and
when
my
friend
proposed
that
i
should
go
with
him
to
see
his
petroleum
wells
a
few
miles
out
of
the
city
i
gazed
at
him
with
such
a
scared
hopeless
expression
that
he
begged
me
in
the
most
friendly
and
polite
way
to
forgive
him
it
was
five
and
quite
dusk
and
i
wanted
to
go
back
to
my
hotel
my
host
asked
if
i
would
allow
him
to
take
me
back
by
the
hills
the
road
was
rather
longer
but
i
should
be
able
to
have
a
eye
view
of
pittsburg
and
he
assured
me
that
it
was
quite
worth
while
we
started
off
in
the
buggy
with
two
fresh
horses
and
a
few
minutes
later
i
had
the
wildest
dream
it
seemed
to
me
that
he
was
pluto
the
god
of
the
infernal
regions
and
i
was
proserpine
we
were
travelling
through
our
empire
at
a
quick
trot
drawn
by
our
winged
horses
all
round
us
we
could
see
fire
and
flames
the
sky
was
blurred
with
long
black
trails
that
looked
like
veils
the
ground
was
covered
with
long
arms
of
iron
stretched
heavenwards
in
a
supreme
imprecation
these
arms
threw
forth
smoke
flames
or
sparks
which
fell
again
in
a
shower
of
stars
the
buggy
carried
us
on
up
the
hills
and
the
cold
froze
our
limbs
while
the
fires
excited
our
brains
it
was
then
that
my
friend
told
me
of
his
love
for
the
niagara
falls
he
spoke
of
them
more
like
a
lover
than
an
admirer
and
told
me
he
liked
to
go
to
them
alone
he
said
though
that
for
me
he
would
make
an
exception
he
spoke
of
the
rapids
with
such
intense
passion
that
i
felt
rather
uneasy
and
began
to
wonder
whether
the
man
was
not
mad
i
grew
alarmed
for
he
was
driving
along
over
the
very
verge
of
the
precipice
jumping
the
stone
heaps
i
glanced
at
him
sideways
his
face
was
calm
but
his
twitched
slightly
and
i
had
noticed
this
particularly
with
his
deaf
brother
also
by
this
time
i
was
quite
nervous
the
cold
and
the
fires
this
demoniacal
drive
the
sound
of
the
anvil
ringing
out
mournful
chimes
which
seemed
to
come
from
under
the
earth
and
then
the
deep
forge
whistle
sounding
like
a
desperate
cry
rending
the
silence
of
the
night
the
too
with
their
lungs
spitting
forth
their
smoke
with
a
perpetual
and
the
wind
which
had
just
risen
twisting
the
streaks
of
smoke
into
spirals
which
it
sent
up
towards
the
sky
or
beat
down
all
at
once
on
to
us
all
this
wild
dance
of
the
natural
and
the
human
elements
affected
my
whole
nervous
system
so
that
it
was
quite
time
for
me
to
get
back
to
the
hotel
i
sprang
out
of
the
carriage
quickly
on
arriving
and
arranged
to
see
my
friend
at
buffalo
but
alas
i
was
never
to
see
him
again
he
took
cold
that
very
day
and
could
not
meet
me
there
and
the
following
year
i
heard
that
he
had
been
dashed
against
the
rocks
when
trying
to
navigate
a
boat
in
the
rapids
he
died
of
his
passion
for
his
passion
at
the
hotel
all
the
artistes
were
awaiting
me
as
i
had
forgotten
we
were
to
have
a
rehearsal
of
princesse
at
four
i
noticed
a
face
that
was
unknown
to
me
among
the
members
of
our
company
and
on
making
inquiries
about
this
person
found
that
he
was
an
illustrator
who
had
come
with
an
introduction
from
jarrett
he
asked
to
be
allowed
to
make
a
few
sketches
of
me
and
after
giving
orders
that
he
should
be
taken
to
a
seat
i
did
not
trouble
any
more
about
him
we
had
to
hurry
through
the
rehearsal
in
order
to
be
at
the
theatre
in
time
for
the
performance
of
which
we
were
giving
that
night
the
rehearsal
was
accordingly
rushed
and
gabbled
through
so
that
it
was
soon
over
and
the
stranger
took
his
departure
refusing
to
let
me
look
at
his
sketches
on
the
plea
that
he
wanted
to
touch
them
up
before
showing
them
my
joy
was
great
the
following
day
when
jarrett
arrived
at
my
hotel
perfectly
furious
holding
in
his
hand
the
principal
newspaper
of
pittsburg
in
which
our
illustrator
who
turned
out
to
be
a
journalist
had
written
an
article
giving
at
full
length
an
account
of
the
dress
rehearsal
of
the
play
of
wrote
this
delightful
imbecile
is
only
one
scene
of
any
importance
and
that
is
the
one
between
the
two
sisters
madame
sarah
bernhardt
did
not
impress
me
greatly
and
as
to
the
artistes
of
the
comédie
française
i
considered
they
were
mediocre
the
costumes
were
not
very
fine
and
in
the
ball
scene
the
men
did
not
wear
dress
jarrett
was
wild
with
rage
and
i
was
wild
with
joy
he
knew
my
horror
of
reporters
and
he
had
introduced
this
one
in
an
underhand
way
hoping
to
get
a
good
advertisement
out
of
it
the
journalist
imagined
that
we
were
having
a
dress
rehearsal
of
and
we
were
merely
rehearsing
alexandre
for
the
sake
of
refreshing
our
memory
he
had
mistaken
the
scene
between
princesse
georges
and
the
comtesse
de
terremonde
for
the
scene
in
the
third
act
between
the
two
sisters
in
we
were
all
of
us
wearing
our
travelling
costumes
and
he
was
surprised
at
not
seeing
the
men
in
dress
coats
and
the
women
in
evening
dress
what
fun
this
was
for
our
company
and
for
all
the
town
and
i
may
add
what
a
subject
it
furnished
for
the
jokes
of
all
the
rival
newspapers
i
had
to
play
two
days
at
pittsburg
and
then
go
on
to
bradford
erie
toronto
and
arrive
at
buffalo
on
sunday
it
was
my
intention
to
give
all
the
members
of
my
company
a
outing
at
niagara
falls
but
abbey
too
wanted
to
invite
them
we
had
a
discussion
on
the
subject
and
it
was
extremely
animated
he
was
very
dictatorial
and
so
was
i
and
we
both
preferred
giving
the
whole
thing
up
rather
than
yield
to
each
other
jarrett
however
pointed
out
the
fact
to
us
that
this
course
would
deprive
the
artistes
of
a
little
festivity
about
which
they
heard
a
great
deal
and
to
which
they
were
looking
forward
we
therefore
gave
in
finally
and
in
order
to
settle
the
matter
we
agreed
to
share
the
outlay
between
us
the
artistes
accepted
our
invitation
with
the
most
charming
good
grace
and
we
took
the
train
for
buffalo
where
we
arrived
at
ten
minutes
past
six
in
the
morning
we
had
telegraphed
beforehand
for
carriages
and
coffee
to
be
in
readiness
and
to
have
food
provided
for
us
as
it
is
simply
madness
for
persons
to
arrive
on
a
sunday
in
such
towns
as
these
without
giving
notice
of
such
an
event
we
had
a
special
train
going
at
full
speed
over
the
lines
which
were
entirely
clear
on
sundays
and
it
was
decorated
with
festoons
of
flowers
the
younger
artistes
were
as
delighted
as
children
those
who
had
already
seen
everything
before
told
about
it
then
there
was
the
eloquence
of
those
who
had
heard
of
it
and
all
this
together
with
the
little
bouquets
of
flowers
distributed
among
the
women
and
the
cigars
and
cigarettes
presented
to
the
men
made
every
one
so
that
all
appeared
to
be
happy
the
carriages
met
our
train
and
took
us
to
the
hotel
which
had
been
kept
open
for
us
there
were
flowers
everywhere
and
any
number
of
small
tables
upon
which
were
coffee
chocolate
or
tea
every
table
was
soon
surrounded
with
guests
i
had
my
sister
abbey
jarrett
and
the
principal
artistes
at
my
table
the
meal
was
of
short
duration
and
very
gay
and
animated
we
then
went
to
the
falls
and
i
remained
more
than
an
hour
on
the
balcony
hollowed
out
of
the
rock
my
eyes
filled
with
tears
as
i
stood
there
for
i
was
deeply
moved
by
the
splendour
of
the
sight
a
radiant
sun
made
the
air
around
us
iridescent
there
were
rainbows
everywhere
lighting
up
the
atmosphere
with
their
soft
silvery
colours
the
pendants
of
hard
ice
hanging
down
along
the
rocks
on
each
side
looked
like
enormous
jewels
i
was
sorry
to
leave
this
balcony
we
went
down
in
narrow
cages
which
glided
gently
into
a
tube
arranged
in
the
cleft
of
the
enormous
rock
we
arrived
in
this
way
under
the
american
falls
they
were
there
almost
over
our
heads
sprinkling
us
with
their
blue
pink
and
mauve
drops
in
front
of
us
protecting
us
from
the
falls
was
a
heap
of
icicles
forming
quite
a
little
mountain
we
climbed
over
this
to
the
best
of
our
ability
my
heavy
fur
mantle
tired
me
and
about
half
way
down
i
took
it
off
and
let
it
slip
over
the
side
of
the
ice
mountain
to
take
it
again
when
i
reached
the
bottom
i
was
wearing
a
dress
of
white
cloth
with
a
satin
blouse
and
every
one
screamed
with
surprise
on
seeing
me
abbey
took
off
his
overcoat
and
threw
it
over
my
shoulders
i
shook
this
off
quickly
and
coat
went
to
join
my
fur
cloak
below
the
poor
face
looked
very
blank
as
he
had
taken
a
fair
number
of
cocktails
he
staggered
fell
down
on
the
ice
got
up
and
immediately
fell
again
to
the
amusement
of
every
one
i
was
not
at
all
cold
as
i
never
am
when
out
of
doors
i
only
feel
the
cold
inside
houses
when
i
am
inactive
finally
we
arrived
at
the
highest
point
of
the
ice
and
the
cataract
was
really
most
threatening
we
were
covered
by
the
impalpable
mist
which
rises
in
the
midst
of
the
tumultuous
noise
i
gazed
at
it
all
bewildered
and
fascinated
by
the
rapid
movement
of
the
water
which
looked
like
a
wide
curtain
of
silver
unfolding
itself
to
be
dashed
violently
into
a
rebounding
splashing
heap
with
a
noise
unlike
any
sound
i
had
ever
heard
i
very
easily
turn
dizzy
and
i
know
very
well
that
if
i
had
been
alone
i
should
have
remained
there
for
ever
with
my
eyes
fixed
on
the
sheet
of
water
hurrying
along
at
full
speed
my
mind
lulled
by
the
fascinating
sound
and
my
limbs
numbed
by
the
treacherous
cold
which
encircled
us
i
had
to
be
dragged
away
but
i
am
soon
myself
again
when
confronted
by
an
obstacle
we
had
to
go
down
again
and
this
was
not
as
easy
as
it
had
been
to
climb
up
i
took
the
belonging
to
one
of
my
friends
and
then
sat
down
on
the
ice
by
putting
the
stick
under
my
legs
i
was
able
to
slide
down
to
the
bottom
all
the
others
imitated
me
and
it
was
a
comical
sight
to
see
people
descending
the
in
this
way
there
were
several
somersaults
and
collisions
and
plenty
of
laughter
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
we
were
all
at
the
hotel
where
luncheon
had
been
ordered
we
were
all
cold
and
hungry
it
was
warm
inside
the
hotel
and
the
meal
smelt
good
when
luncheon
was
over
the
landlord
of
the
hotel
asked
me
to
go
into
a
small
where
a
surprise
awaited
me
on
entering
i
saw
on
a
table
protected
under
a
long
glass
box
the
niagara
falls
in
miniature
with
the
rocks
looking
like
pebbles
a
large
glass
represented
the
sheet
of
water
and
glass
threads
represented
the
falls
here
and
there
was
some
foliage
of
a
hard
crude
green
standing
up
on
a
little
hillock
of
ice
was
a
figure
intended
for
me
it
was
enough
to
make
any
one
howl
with
horror
for
it
was
all
so
hideous
i
managed
to
raise
a
broad
smile
for
the
benefit
of
the
hotel
keeper
by
way
of
congratulating
him
on
his
good
taste
but
i
was
petrified
on
recognising
the
of
my
friends
the
th
brothers
of
pittsburg
they
had
sent
this
monstrous
caricature
of
the
most
beautiful
thing
in
the
world
i
read
the
letter
which
their
domestic
handed
me
and
all
my
disdain
melted
away
they
had
gone
to
so
much
trouble
in
order
to
explain
what
they
wanted
me
to
understand
and
they
were
so
delighted
at
the
idea
of
giving
me
any
pleasure
i
dismissed
the
valet
after
giving
him
a
letter
for
his
masters
and
i
asked
the
hotel
keeper
to
send
the
work
of
art
to
paris
packed
carefully
i
hoped
that
it
might
arrive
in
fragments
the
thought
of
it
haunted
me
though
and
i
wondered
how
my
passion
for
the
falls
could
be
reconciled
with
the
idea
of
such
a
gift
whilst
admitting
that
his
imaginative
mind
might
have
hoped
to
be
able
to
carry
out
his
idea
how
was
it
that
he
was
not
indignant
at
the
sight
of
this
grotesque
imitation
how
had
he
dared
to
send
it
to
me
how
was
it
that
my
friend
loved
the
falls
and
what
had
he
understood
of
their
marvellous
grandeur
since
his
death
i
have
questioned
my
own
memory
of
him
a
hundred
times
but
all
in
vain
he
died
for
them
tossed
about
in
their
waters
killed
by
their
caresses
and
i
can
not
think
that
he
could
ever
have
seen
how
beautiful
they
really
were
fortunately
i
was
called
away
as
the
carriage
was
there
and
every
one
waiting
for
me
the
horses
started
off
with
us
trotting
in
that
weary
way
peculiar
to
horses
when
we
arrived
on
the
canadian
shore
we
had
to
go
underground
and
array
ourselves
in
black
or
yellow
mackintoshes
we
looked
like
so
many
heavy
dumpy
sailors
who
were
wearing
these
garments
for
the
first
time
there
were
two
large
cells
to
shelter
us
one
for
the
women
and
the
other
for
the
men
every
one
undressed
more
or
less
in
the
midst
of
wild
confusion
and
making
a
little
package
of
our
clothes
we
gave
this
into
the
keeping
of
the
woman
in
charge
with
the
mackintosh
hood
drawn
tightly
under
the
chin
hiding
the
hair
entirely
an
enormous
blouse
much
too
wide
covering
the
whole
body
fur
boots
with
roughed
soles
to
avoid
broken
legs
and
heads
and
immense
mackintosh
breeches
in
zouave
style
the
prettiest
and
slenderest
woman
was
at
once
transformed
into
a
huge
cumbersome
awkward
bear
an
cudgel
to
carry
in
the
hand
completed
this
becoming
costume
i
looked
more
ridiculous
than
the
others
for
i
would
not
cover
my
hair
and
in
the
most
pretentious
way
i
had
fastened
some
roses
into
my
mackintosh
blouse
the
women
went
into
raptures
on
seeing
me
pretty
she
looks
like
that
they
exclaimed
always
finds
a
way
to
be
the
men
kissed
my
paw
in
the
most
gallant
way
bowing
low
and
saying
in
low
tones
and
the
queen
the
fairy
the
goddess
the
divinity
and
i
went
along
purring
with
content
and
quite
satisfied
with
myself
until
as
i
passed
by
the
counter
where
the
girl
who
gives
the
tickets
was
sitting
i
caught
sight
of
myself
in
the
glass
i
looked
enormous
and
ridiculous
with
my
roses
pinned
in
and
the
curly
locks
of
hair
forming
a
kind
of
peak
to
my
clumsy
hood
i
appeared
to
be
stouter
than
all
the
others
because
of
the
silver
belt
i
was
wearing
round
my
waist
as
this
drew
up
the
hard
folds
of
the
mackintosh
round
my
hips
my
thin
face
was
nearly
covered
by
my
hair
which
was
flattened
down
by
my
hood
my
eyes
could
not
be
seen
and
only
my
mouth
served
to
show
that
this
barrel
was
a
human
being
furious
with
myself
for
my
pretentious
coquetry
and
ashamed
of
my
own
weakness
in
having
been
so
content
with
the
pitiful
insincere
flattery
of
people
who
were
making
fun
of
me
i
decided
to
remain
as
i
was
as
a
punishment
for
my
stupid
vanity
there
were
a
number
of
strangers
among
us
who
nudged
each
other
pointing
to
me
and
laughing
slyly
at
my
absurd
and
this
was
only
what
i
deserved
we
went
down
the
flight
of
steps
cut
in
the
block
of
ice
in
order
to
get
underneath
the
canadian
falls
the
sight
there
was
most
strange
and
extraordinary
above
me
i
saw
an
immense
cupola
of
ice
hanging
over
in
space
attached
only
on
one
side
to
the
rock
from
this
cupola
thousands
of
icicles
of
the
most
varied
shapes
were
hanging
there
were
dragons
arrows
crosses
laughing
faces
sorrowful
faces
hands
with
six
fingers
deformed
feet
incomplete
human
bodies
and
long
locks
of
hair
in
fact
with
the
help
of
the
imagination
and
by
fixing
the
gaze
when
looking
with
eyes
the
illusion
is
complete
and
in
less
time
than
it
takes
to
describe
all
this
one
can
evoke
all
the
pictures
of
nature
and
of
our
dreams
all
the
wild
conceptions
of
a
diseased
mind
or
the
realities
of
a
reflective
brain
in
front
of
us
were
small
steeples
of
ice
some
of
them
proud
and
erect
standing
out
against
the
sky
others
ravaged
by
the
wind
which
gnaws
the
ice
looking
like
minarets
ready
for
the
muezzin
on
the
right
a
cascade
was
rushing
down
as
noisily
as
on
the
other
side
but
the
sun
had
commenced
its
descent
towards
the
west
and
everything
was
tinged
with
a
rosy
hue
the
water
splashed
over
us
and
we
were
suddenly
covered
with
small
silvery
waves
which
when
shaken
slightly
stiffened
against
our
mackintoshes
it
was
a
shoal
of
very
small
fish
which
had
had
the
misfortune
to
be
driven
into
the
current
and
which
had
come
to
die
in
the
dazzling
brilliancy
of
the
setting
sun
on
the
other
side
there
was
a
small
block
which
looked
like
a
rhinoceros
entering
the
water
should
love
to
mount
on
that
i
exclaimed
but
it
is
impossible
replied
one
of
my
friends
as
to
that
nothing
is
impossible
i
said
is
only
the
risk
the
crevice
to
be
covered
is
not
a
yard
but
it
is
deep
remarked
an
artiste
who
was
with
us
i
said
dog
is
just
dead
we
will
bet
a
dog
and
if
i
win
i
am
to
choose
my
dog
that
i
abbey
was
fetched
immediately
but
he
only
arrived
in
time
to
see
me
on
the
block
i
came
very
near
falling
into
the
crevice
and
when
i
was
on
the
back
of
the
rhinoceros
i
could
not
stand
up
it
was
as
smooth
and
transparent
as
artificial
ice
i
sat
down
on
its
back
holding
on
to
the
little
hump
and
i
declared
that
if
no
one
came
to
fetch
me
i
should
stay
where
i
was
as
i
had
not
the
courage
to
move
a
step
on
this
slippery
back
and
then
too
it
seemed
to
me
as
though
it
moved
slightly
i
began
to
lose
my
i
felt
dizzy
but
i
had
won
my
dog
my
excitement
was
over
and
i
was
seized
with
fright
every
one
gazed
at
me
in
a
bewildered
way
and
that
increased
my
terror
my
sister
went
into
hysterics
and
my
dear
guérard
groaned
in
a
heartrending
way
heavens
my
dear
sarah
oh
heavens
an
artist
was
making
sketches
fortunately
the
members
of
our
company
had
gone
up
again
in
order
to
go
and
see
the
rapids
abbey
besought
me
to
return
poor
jarrett
besought
me
but
i
felt
dizzy
and
i
could
not
and
would
not
cross
again
angelo
then
sprang
across
the
crevice
and
remaining
there
called
for
a
plank
of
wood
and
a
hatchet
bravo
i
exclaimed
from
the
back
of
my
rhinoceros
the
plank
was
brought
it
was
an
old
piece
of
wood
and
i
glanced
at
it
suspiciously
the
hatchet
cut
into
the
tail
of
my
rhinoceros
and
the
plank
was
fixed
firmly
by
angelo
on
my
side
and
held
by
abbey
jarrett
and
claude
on
the
other
side
i
let
myself
slide
over
the
crupper
of
my
rhinoceros
and
i
then
started
not
without
terror
along
the
rotten
plank
of
wood
which
was
so
narrow
that
i
was
obliged
to
put
one
foot
in
front
of
the
other
the
heel
over
the
toe
i
returned
in
a
very
feverish
state
to
the
hotel
and
the
artist
brought
me
the
droll
sketches
he
had
taken
after
a
light
luncheon
i
was
to
start
again
by
the
train
which
had
been
waiting
for
us
twenty
minutes
all
the
others
had
taken
their
seats
some
time
before
i
was
leaving
without
having
seen
the
rapids
in
which
my
poor
pittsburg
friend
met
his
death
xxxviii
the
return
to
france
the
welcome
at
hâvre
our
great
voyage
was
drawing
towards
its
close
i
say
great
voyage
for
it
was
my
first
one
it
had
lasted
seven
months
the
voyages
i
have
since
undertaken
were
always
from
eleven
to
sixteen
months
from
buffalo
we
went
to
rochester
utica
syracuse
albany
troy
worcester
providence
newark
making
a
short
stay
in
washington
an
admirable
city
but
one
which
at
that
time
had
a
sadness
about
it
that
affected
nerves
it
was
the
last
large
city
i
visited
after
two
admirable
performances
there
and
a
supper
at
the
embassy
we
left
for
baltimore
philadelphia
and
new
york
where
our
tour
was
to
come
to
a
close
in
that
city
i
gave
a
grand
professional
at
the
general
demand
of
the
actors
and
actresses
of
new
york
the
piece
chosen
was
princesse
oh
what
a
fine
and
performance
everything
was
applauded
by
the
artistes
nothing
escaped
the
particular
state
of
mind
of
that
audience
made
up
of
actors
and
actresses
painters
and
sculptors
at
the
end
of
the
play
a
gold
was
handed
to
me
on
which
were
engraved
the
names
of
a
great
number
of
persons
present
from
salvini
i
received
a
pretty
casket
of
lapis
and
from
mary
anderson
at
that
time
in
the
striking
beauty
of
her
nineteen
years
a
small
medal
bearing
a
in
turquoises
in
my
i
counted
one
hundred
and
thirty
bouquets
that
evening
we
gave
our
last
performance
with
dame
aux
i
had
to
return
and
bow
to
the
public
fourteen
times
then
i
had
a
stupefaction
for
in
the
tempest
of
cries
and
bravos
i
heard
a
shrill
cry
shouted
by
thousands
of
mouths
which
i
did
not
in
the
least
understand
after
each
i
asked
in
the
wings
what
the
meaning
of
the
word
was
that
struck
on
my
ears
like
a
dreadful
sneeze
beginning
again
time
after
time
jarrett
appeared
and
enlightened
me
are
calling
for
a
i
looked
at
him
abashed
they
want
you
to
make
a
little
no
i
exclaimed
as
i
again
went
on
the
stage
to
make
a
bow
and
in
making
my
bow
to
the
public
i
murmured
can
not
speak
but
i
can
tell
you
thank
you
with
all
my
heart
it
was
in
the
midst
of
a
thunder
of
applause
underscored
with
hip
hurrah
la
france
that
i
left
the
theatre
on
wednesday
may
i
embarked
on
the
same
transatlantic
steamer
the
the
phantom
vessel
to
which
my
journey
had
brought
good
luck
but
it
had
no
longer
the
same
commander
the
new
name
was
santelli
he
was
as
little
and
as
his
predecessor
was
big
and
dark
but
he
was
as
charming
and
a
nice
conversationist
commander
jowclas
blew
his
brains
out
after
losing
heavily
at
play
my
cabin
had
been
newly
fitted
up
and
this
time
the
had
been
covered
in
material
on
boarding
the
steamer
i
turned
towards
the
friendly
crowd
and
threw
them
a
last
adieu
revoir
they
shouted
back
i
then
went
towards
my
cabin
standing
at
the
door
in
an
elegant
suit
wearing
pointed
shoes
hat
in
the
latest
style
and
gloves
stood
henry
smith
the
showman
of
whales
i
gave
a
cry
like
that
of
a
wild
beast
he
kept
his
joyful
smile
and
held
out
a
jewel
casket
which
i
took
with
the
object
of
throwing
it
into
the
sea
through
the
open
but
jarrett
caught
hold
of
my
arm
and
took
possession
of
the
casket
which
he
opened
is
magnificent
he
exclaimed
but
i
had
closed
my
eyes
i
stopped
up
my
ears
and
cried
out
to
the
man
away
you
knave
you
brute
go
away
i
hope
you
will
die
under
atrocious
suffering
go
away
i
half
opened
my
eyes
he
had
gone
jarrett
wanted
to
talk
to
me
about
the
present
i
would
not
hear
anything
about
it
for
sake
jarrett
leave
me
alone
since
this
jewel
is
so
fine
give
it
to
your
daughter
and
do
not
speak
to
me
about
it
any
and
he
did
so
the
evening
before
my
departure
from
america
i
had
received
a
long
cablegram
signed
grosos
president
of
the
life
saving
society
at
hâvre
asking
me
to
give
upon
my
arrival
a
performance
the
proceeds
of
which
would
be
distributed
among
the
families
of
the
society
of
life
savers
i
accepted
with
unspeakable
joy
on
regaining
my
native
land
i
should
assist
in
drying
tears
after
the
decks
had
been
cleared
for
departure
our
ship
moved
slowly
off
and
we
left
new
york
on
thursday
the
of
may
detesting
sea
travelling
as
i
usually
do
i
set
out
this
time
with
a
light
heart
and
smiling
face
disdainful
of
the
horrible
discomfort
caused
by
the
voyage
we
had
not
left
new
york
hours
when
the
vessel
stopped
i
sprang
out
of
my
berth
and
was
soon
on
deck
fearing
some
accident
to
our
as
we
had
the
ship
in
front
of
us
a
french
boat
had
raised
lowered
and
again
raised
its
small
flags
the
captain
who
had
given
the
replies
to
these
signals
sent
for
me
and
explained
to
me
the
working
and
the
orthography
of
the
signals
i
could
not
remember
anything
he
told
me
i
must
confess
to
my
shame
a
small
boat
was
lowered
from
the
ship
opposite
us
and
two
sailors
and
a
young
man
very
poorly
dressed
and
with
a
pale
face
embarked
our
captain
had
the
steps
lowered
the
small
boat
was
hailed
and
the
young
man
escorted
by
two
sailors
came
on
deck
one
of
them
handed
a
letter
to
the
officer
who
was
waiting
at
the
top
of
the
steps
he
read
it
and
looking
at
the
young
man
he
said
quietly
me
the
small
boat
and
the
sailors
returned
to
the
ship
the
boat
was
hoisted
the
whistle
shrieked
and
after
the
usual
salute
the
two
ships
continued
their
way
the
unfortunate
young
man
was
brought
before
the
captain
i
went
away
after
asking
the
captain
to
tell
me
later
on
what
was
the
meaning
of
it
all
unless
it
should
prove
to
be
something
which
had
to
be
kept
secret
the
captain
came
himself
and
told
me
the
little
story
the
young
man
was
a
poor
artist
a
who
had
managed
to
slip
on
to
a
steamer
bound
for
new
york
he
had
not
a
sou
of
money
for
his
passage
as
he
had
not
even
been
able
to
pay
for
an
ticket
he
had
hoped
to
get
through
without
being
noticed
hiding
under
the
bales
of
various
kinds
he
had
however
been
taken
ill
and
it
was
this
illness
which
had
betrayed
him
shivering
with
cold
and
feverish
he
had
talked
aloud
in
his
sleep
uttering
the
most
incoherent
words
he
was
taken
into
the
infirmary
and
when
there
he
had
confessed
everything
the
captain
undertook
to
make
him
accept
what
i
sent
him
for
his
journey
to
america
the
story
soon
spread
and
other
passengers
made
a
collection
so
that
the
young
engraver
found
himself
very
soon
in
possession
of
a
fortune
of
twelve
hundred
francs
three
days
later
he
brought
me
a
little
wooden
box
manufactured
carved
and
engraved
by
him
this
little
box
is
now
nearly
full
of
petals
of
flowers
for
every
year
on
may
i
received
a
small
bouquet
of
flowers
with
these
words
always
the
same
ones
year
after
year
and
i
always
put
the
petals
of
the
flowers
into
the
little
box
but
for
the
last
seven
years
i
have
not
received
any
is
it
forgetfulness
or
death
which
has
caused
the
artist
to
discontinue
this
graceful
little
token
of
gratitude
i
have
no
idea
but
the
sight
of
the
box
always
gives
me
a
vague
feeling
of
sadness
as
forgetfulness
and
death
are
the
most
faithful
companions
of
the
human
being
forgetfulness
takes
up
its
abode
in
our
mind
in
our
heart
while
death
is
always
present
laying
traps
for
us
watching
all
we
do
and
jeering
gaily
when
sleep
closes
our
eyes
for
we
give
it
then
the
illusion
of
what
it
knows
will
some
day
be
a
reality
apart
from
the
above
incident
nothing
particular
happened
during
the
voyage
i
spent
every
night
on
deck
gazing
at
the
horizon
hoping
to
draw
towards
me
that
land
on
which
were
my
loved
ones
i
turned
in
towards
morning
and
slept
all
day
to
kill
the
time
the
steamers
in
those
days
did
not
perform
the
crossing
with
the
same
speed
as
they
do
nowadays
the
hours
seemed
to
me
to
be
wickedly
long
i
was
so
impatient
to
land
that
i
called
for
the
doctor
and
asked
him
to
send
me
to
sleep
for
eighteen
hours
he
gave
me
twelve
hours
sleep
with
a
strong
dose
of
chloral
and
i
felt
stronger
and
calmer
for
affronting
the
shock
of
happiness
santelli
had
promised
that
we
should
arrive
on
the
evening
of
the
i
was
ready
and
had
been
walking
up
and
down
distractedly
for
an
hour
when
an
officer
came
to
ask
whether
i
would
not
go
on
to
the
bridge
with
the
commander
who
was
waiting
for
me
with
my
sister
i
went
up
in
haste
and
soon
understood
from
the
embarrassed
circumlocutions
of
the
amiable
santelli
that
we
were
too
far
off
to
hope
to
make
the
harbour
that
night
i
began
to
cry
i
thought
we
should
never
arrive
i
imagined
that
the
sprite
was
going
to
triumph
and
i
wept
those
tears
that
were
like
a
brook
that
runs
on
and
on
without
ceasing
the
commander
did
what
he
could
to
bring
me
to
a
rational
state
of
mind
i
descended
from
the
bridge
with
both
body
and
soul
like
limp
rags
i
lay
down
on
a
and
when
dawn
came
was
benumbed
and
sleepy
it
was
five
in
the
morning
we
were
still
twenty
miles
from
land
the
sun
however
began
joyously
to
brighten
up
the
small
white
clouds
light
as
snowflakes
the
remembrance
of
my
young
beloved
one
gave
me
courage
again
i
ran
towards
my
cabin
i
spent
a
long
while
over
my
toilet
in
order
to
kill
time
at
seven
i
made
inquiries
of
the
captain
are
twelve
miles
off
he
said
two
hours
we
shall
swear
to
it
i
i
returned
on
deck
where
leaning
on
the
bulwark
i
scanned
the
distance
a
small
steamer
appeared
on
the
horizon
i
saw
it
without
looking
at
it
expecting
every
minute
to
hear
a
cry
from
over
there
over
there
all
at
once
i
noticed
masses
of
little
white
flags
being
waved
on
the
small
steamer
i
got
my
glasses
and
then
let
them
fall
with
a
joyous
cry
that
left
me
without
any
strength
without
breath
i
wanted
to
speak
i
could
not
my
face
it
appears
became
so
pale
that
it
frightened
the
people
who
were
about
me
my
sister
jeanne
wept
as
she
waved
her
arms
towards
the
distance
they
wanted
to
make
me
sit
down
i
would
not
hanging
on
to
the
bulwarks
i
smell
the
salts
that
are
thrust
under
my
nose
i
allow
friendly
hands
to
wipe
my
temples
but
i
am
gazing
over
there
whence
the
vessel
is
coming
over
there
lies
my
happiness
my
joy
my
life
my
everything
dearer
than
everything
the
the
name
comes
near
a
bridge
of
love
is
formed
between
the
small
and
the
large
ship
a
bridge
formed
of
the
beatings
of
our
hearts
under
the
weight
of
the
kisses
that
have
been
kept
back
for
so
many
days
then
comes
the
reaction
that
takes
place
in
our
tears
when
the
small
boats
coming
up
to
the
large
vessel
allow
the
impatient
ones
to
climb
up
the
rope
ladders
and
throw
themselves
into
outstretched
arms
the
is
invaded
every
one
is
there
my
dear
and
faithful
friends
they
have
accompanied
my
young
son
maurice
ah
what
a
delicious
time
answers
get
ahead
of
questions
laughter
is
mingled
with
tears
hands
are
pressed
lips
are
kissed
only
to
begin
over
again
one
is
never
tired
of
this
repetition
of
tender
affection
during
this
time
our
ship
is
moving
the
has
disappeared
carrying
away
the
mails
the
farther
we
advance
the
more
small
boats
we
meet
they
are
decked
with
flags
ploughing
the
sea
there
are
a
hundred
of
them
and
more
are
coming
it
a
public
holiday
i
asked
georges
boyer
the
correspondent
of
the
who
with
some
friends
had
come
to
meet
me
yes
madame
a
great
day
at
hâvre
for
they
are
expecting
the
return
of
a
fairy
who
left
seven
months
it
really
in
my
honour
that
all
these
pretty
boats
have
spread
their
wings
and
beflagged
their
masts
ah
how
happy
i
am
we
are
now
alongside
the
jetty
there
are
perhaps
twenty
thousand
people
there
who
cry
out
sarah
bernhardt
i
was
dumfounded
i
did
not
expect
any
triumphant
return
i
was
well
aware
that
the
performance
to
be
given
for
the
life
saving
society
had
won
the
hearts
of
the
people
of
hâvre
but
now
i
learnt
that
trains
had
come
from
paris
packed
with
people
to
welcome
my
return
i
feel
my
pulse
it
is
me
i
am
not
dreaming
the
boat
stops
opposite
a
red
velvet
tent
and
an
invisible
orchestra
strikes
up
an
air
from
châlet
i
smile
at
this
quite
french
childishness
i
get
off
and
walk
through
the
midst
of
a
hedge
of
smiling
kind
faces
of
sailors
who
offer
me
flowers
within
the
tent
all
the
are
waiting
for
me
wearing
on
their
broad
chests
the
medals
they
have
so
well
deserved
grosos
the
president
reads
to
me
the
following
address
as
president
i
have
the
honour
to
present
to
you
a
delegation
from
the
life
saving
society
of
hâvre

to
welcome
you
and
express
their
gratitude
for
the
sympathy
you
have
so
warmly
worded
in
your
transatlantic
despatch
have
also
come
to
congratulate
you
on
the
immense
success
that
you
have
met
with
at
every
place
you
have
visited
during
your
adventurous
journey
you
have
now
achieved
in
two
worlds
an
incontestable
popularity
and
artistic
celebrity
and
your
marvellous
talent
added
to
your
personal
charms
has
affirmed
abroad
that
france
is
always
the
land
of
art
and
the
birthplace
of
elegance
and
beauty
distant
echo
of
the
words
you
spoke
in
denmark
evoking
a
deep
and
sad
memory
still
strikes
on
our
ears
it
repeats
that
your
heart
is
as
french
as
your
talent
for
in
the
midst
of
the
feverish
and
burning
successes
on
the
stage
you
have
never
forgotten
to
unite
your
patriotism
to
your
artistic
triumphs
have
charged
me
with
expressing
to
you
their
admiration
for
the
charming
benefactress
whose
generous
hand
has
spontaneously
stretched
itself
out
towards
their
poor
but
noble
society
they
wish
to
offer
you
these
flowers
gathered
from
the
soil
of
the
on
the
land
of
france
where
you
will
find
them
everywhere
under
your
feet
they
are
worthy
that
you
should
accept
them
with
favour
for
they
are
presented
to
you
by
the
bravest
and
most
loyal
of
our
it
is
said
that
my
reply
was
very
eloquent
but
i
can
not
affirm
that
that
reply
was
really
made
by
me
i
had
lived
for
several
hours
in
a
state
of
from
successive
emotions
i
had
taken
no
food
had
no
sleep
my
heart
had
not
ceased
to
beat
a
moving
and
joyous
refrain
my
brain
had
been
filled
with
a
thousand
facts
that
had
been
piled
up
for
seven
months
and
narrated
in
two
hours
this
triumphant
reception
which
i
was
far
from
expecting
after
what
had
happened
just
before
my
departure
after
having
been
so
badly
treated
by
the
paris
press
after
the
incidents
of
my
journey
which
had
been
always
badly
interpreted
by
several
french
papers
all
these
coincidences
were
of
such
different
proportions
that
they
seemed
hardly
credible
the
performance
furnished
a
fruitful
harvest
for
the
as
for
me
i
played
dame
aux
for
the
first
time
in
france
i
was
really
inspired
i
affirm
that
those
who
were
present
at
that
performance
experienced
the
quintessence
of
what
my
personal
art
can
give
i
spent
the
night
at
my
place
at
ste
adresse
the
day
following
i
left
for
paris
a
most
flattering
ovation
was
waiting
for
me
on
my
arrival
then
three
days
afterwards
installed
in
my
little
mansion
in
the
avenue
de
villiers
i
received
victorien
sardou
in
order
to
hear
him
read
his
magnificent
piece
what
a
great
artiste
what
an
admirable
actor
what
a
marvellous
author
he
read
that
play
to
me
right
off
playing
every
giving
me
in
one
second
the
vision
of
what
i
should
do
i
exclaimed
after
the
reading
was
over
dear
master
thanks
for
this
beautiful
part
thanks
for
the
fine
lesson
you
have
just
given
that
night
left
me
without
sleep
for
i
wished
to
catch
a
glimpse
in
the
darkness
of
the
small
star
in
which
i
had
faith
i
saw
it
as
dawn
was
breaking
and
fell
asleep
thinking
over
the
new
era
that
it
was
going
to
light
up
my
artistic
journey
had
lasted
seven
months

had
visited

for
this

of
my
life
the
real
of
my
physical
and
moral
being
i
had
run
away
from
the
comédie
française
from
paris
from
france
from
my
family
and
from
my
friends
i
had
thought
of
having
a
wild
ride
across
mountains
seas
and
space
and
i
came
back
in
love
with
the
vast
horizon
but
calmed
down
by
the
feeling
of
responsibility
which
for
seven
months
had
been
weighing
on
my
shoulders
the
terrible
jarrett
with
his
implacable
and
cruel
wisdom
had
tamed
my
wild
nature
by
a
constant
appeal
to
my
probity
in
those
few
months
my
mind
had
matured
and
the
brusqueness
of
my
will
was
softened
my
life
which
i
thought
at
first
was
to
be
so
short
seemed
now
likely
to
be
very
very
long
and
that
gave
me
a
great
mischievous
delight
whenever
i
thought
of
the
infernal
displeasure
of
my
enemies
i
resolved
to
live
i
resolved
to
be
the
great
artiste
that
i
longed
to
be
and
from
the
time
of
this
return
i
gave
myself
entirely
up
to
my
life
