this

an

to
unravel
the
tangled
mesh
of
circumstances
that
led
up
to
the
armistice
day
tragedy
in
centralia
washington
the
writer
is
one
of
those
who
believe
that
the
taking
of
human
life
is
justifiable
only
in
even
then
the
act
is
a
horrible
reversion
to
the
brute
to
the
low
plane
of
savagery
civilization
to
be
worthy
of
the
name
must
afford
other
methods
of
settling
human
differences
than
those
of
blood
letting
the
nation
was
shocked
on
november
to
read
of
the
killing
of
four
american
legion
men
by
members
of
the
industrial
workers
of
the
world
in
centralia
the
capitalist
newspapers
announced
to
the
world
that
these
unoffending
paraders
were
killed
in
cold
blood
that
they
were
murdered
from
ambush
without
provocation
of
any
kind
if
the
author
were
convinced
that
there
was
even
a
slight
possibility
of
this
being
true
he
would
not
raise
his
voice
to
defend
the
perpetrators
of
such
a
cowardly
crime
but
there
are
two
sides
to
every
question
and
perhaps
the
newspapers
presented
only
one
of
these
frank
bickford
an
man
who
participated
in
the
affair
testified
at
the
coroner
inquest
that
the
legion
men
were
attempting
to
raid
the
union
hall
when
they
were
killed
sworn
testimony
of
various
eyewitnesses
has
revealed
the
fact
that
some
of
the
unoffending
paraders
carried
coils
of
rope
and
that
others
were
armed
with
such
weapons
as
would
work
the
demolition
of
the
hall
and
bodily
injury
to
its
occupants
these
things
throw
an
entirely
different
light
on
the
subject
if
this
is
true
it
means
that
the
union
loggers
fired
only
in
and
not
with
the
intention
of
committing
wanton
and
malicious
murder
as
has
been
stated
now
as
at
least
two
of
the
union
men
who
did
the
shooting
were
it
appears
that
the
tragedy
must
have
resulted
from
something
more
than
a
mere
quarrel
between
loggers
and
soldiers
there
must
be
something
back
of
it
all
that
the
public
generally
does
know
about
there
is
only
one
body
of
men
in
the
northwest
who
would
hate
a
union
hall
enough
to
have
it
raided
the
lumber
interests
and
now
we
get
at
the
kernel
of
the
matter
which
is
the
fact
that
the
affair
was
the
outgrowth
of
a
struggle
between
the
lumber
trust
and
its
employees
between
organized
capital
and
organized
labor
a
labor
case
and
so
after
all
the
famous
trial
at
montesano
was
not
a
murder
trial
but
a
labor
trial
in
the
strict
sense
of
the
word
under
the
law
it
must
be
remembered
a
man
is
not
committing
murder
in
defending
his
life
and
property
from
the
felonious
assault
of
a
mob
bent
on
killing
and
destruction
there
is
no
doubt
whatever
but
what
the
lumber
trust
had
plotted
to
make
an
example
of
the
loggers
and
destroy
their
hall
on
this
occasion
and
this
was
not
the
first
time
that
such
atrocities
had
been
attempted
and
actually
committed
is
it
peculiar
that
out
of
many
similar
raids
you
only
heard
of
the
one
where
the
men
defended
themselves
is
the
first
law
of
nature
but
the
preservation
of
its
holy
profits
is
the
first
law
of
the
lumber
trust
the
organized
lumber
workers
were
considered
a
menace
to
the
of
a
few
profiteers
hence
the
attempted
raid
and
the
subsequent
killing
what
is
more
significant
is
the
fact
the
raid
had
been
carefully
planned
weeks
in
advance
there
is
a
great
deal
of
evidence
to
prove
this
point
there
is
no
question
that
the
whole
affair
was
the
outcome
of
a
struggle
a
class
struggle
if
you
please
between
the
union
loggers
and
the
lumber
interests
the
former
seeking
to
organize
the
workers
in
the
woods
and
the
latter
fighting
this
movement
with
all
the
means
at
its
disposal
in
this
light
the
centralia
affair
does
not
appear
as
an
isolated
incident
but
rather
an
incident
in
an
eventful
industrial
conflict
little
known
and
less
understood
between
the
lumber
barons
and
loggers
of
the
pacific
northwest
this
viewpoint
will
place
centralia
in
its
proper
perspective
and
enable
one
to
trace
the
tragedy
back
to
the
circumstances
and
conditions
that
gave
it
birth
but
was
there
a
conspiracy
on
the
part
of
the
lumber
interests
to
commit
murder
and
violence
in
an
effort
to
drive
organized
labor
from
its
domain
weeks
of
patient
investigating
in
and
around
the
scene
or
the
occurrence
has
convinced
the
present
writer
that
such
a
conspiracy
has
existed
a
considerable
amount
of
startling
evidence
has
been
unearthed
that
has
hitherto
been
suppressed
if
you
care
to
consider
labor
version
of
this
unfortunate
incident
you
are
urged
to
read
the
following
truthful
account
of
this
almost
unbelievable
piece
of
mediaeval
intrigue
and
brutality
the
facts
will
speak
for
themselves
credit
them
or
not
but
read
the
forests
of
the
northwest
the
pacific
northwest
is
world
famed
for
its
timber
the
first
white
explorers
to
set
foot
upon
its
fertile
soil
were
awed
by
the
magnitude
and
grandeur
of
its
boundless
stretches
of
virgin
forests
nature
has
never
endowed
any
section
of
our
fair
world
with
such
an
immensity
of
kingly
trees
towering
into
the
sky
to
unthinkable
heights
they
stand
as
living
monuments
to
the
fecundity
of
natural
life
imagine
if
you
can
the
vast
wide
region
of
the
west
coast
hills
slopes
and
valleys
covered
with
millions
of
fir
spruce
and
cedar
trees
raising
their
verdant
crests
a
hundred
two
hundred
or
two
hundred
and
fifty
feet
into
the
air
when
columbus
first
landed
on
the
uncharted
continent
these
trees
were
already
ancient
there
they
stood
straight
and
majestic
with
green
and
streams
purling
here
and
there
at
their
feet
crowning
the
rugged
landscape
with
superlative
beauty
overtopped
only
by
the
mountains
waiting
for
the
hand
of
man
to
put
them
to
the
multitudinous
uses
of
modern
civilization
imagine
if
you
can
the
first
explorer
gazing
down
those
calm
cathedral
isles
wondering
at
the
lavish
bounty
of
our
mother
earth
in
supplying
her
children
with
such
inexhaustible
resources
but
little
could
the
first
explorer
know
that
the
criminal
clutch
of
greed
was
soon
to
seize
these
mighty
forests
guard
them
from
the
human
race
with
bayonets
hangman
ropes
and
legal
statutes
and
use
them
like
to
exact
unimaginable
tribute
from
the
men
and
women
of
the
world
who
need
them
little
did
the
first
explorer
dream
that
the
day
would
come
when
individuals
would
claim
private
ownership
of
that
which
prolific
nature
had
travailed
through
centuries
to
bestow
upon
mankind
but
that
day
has
come
and
with
it
the
struggle
between
master
and
man
that
was
to
result
in
centralia
or
possibly
many
centralias
lumber
a
basic
industry
it
seems
the
most
logical
thing
in
the
world
to
believe
that
the
natural
resources
of
the
earth
upon
which
the
race
depends
for
food
clothing
and
shelter
should
be
owned
collectively
by
the
race
instead
of
being
the
private
property
of
a
few
social
parasites
it
seems
that
reason
would
preclude
the
possibility
of
any
other
arrangement
and
that
it
would
be
considered
as
absurd
for
individuals
to
lay
claim
to
forests
mines
railroads
and
factories
as
it
would
be
for
individuals
to
lay
claim
to
the
ownership
of
the
sunlight
that
warms
us
or
to
the
air
we
breathe
but
the
poor
human
race
in
its
bungling
efforts
to
learn
how
to
live
in
our
beautiful
world
appears
destined
to
find
out
by
bitter
experience
that
the
private
ownership
of
the
means
of
life
is
both
criminal
and
disastrous
lumber
is
one
of
the
basic
industries
one
of
the
industries
mankind
never
could
have
done
without
the
whole
structure
of
what
we
call
civilization
is
built
upon
wooden
timbers
or
machine
finished
as
the
case
may
be
without
the
product
of
the
forests
humanity
would
never
have
learned
the
use
of
fire
the
primitive
bow
and
arrow
or
the
bulging
galleys
of
ancient
commerce
without
the
firm
and
fibrous
flesh
of
the
mighty
monarchs
of
the
forest
men
might
never
have
had
barges
for
fishing
or
weapons
for
the
chase
they
would
not
have
had
carts
for
their
oxen
or
kilns
for
the
fashioning
of
pottery
they
would
not
have
had
dwellings
temples
or
cities
they
would
not
have
had
furniture
nor
fittings
nor
roofs
above
their
heads
wood
is
one
of
the
most
primitive
and
indispensable
of
human
necessities
without
its
use
we
would
still
be
groping
in
the
gloom
and
misery
of
early
savagery
suffering
from
the
cold
of
outer
space
and
defenseless
in
the
midst
of
a
harsh
and
hostile
environment
from
pioneer
to
parasite
so
it
happened
that
the
first
pioneers
in
the
northern
were
forced
to
bare
their
arms
and
match
their
strength
with
the
wooded
wilderness
at
first
the
subjugation
of
the
forests
was
a
social
effort
the
lives
and
future
prosperity
of
the
settlers
must
be
made
secure
from
the
raids
of
the
indians
and
the
inclemency
of
the
elements
manfully
did
these
men
labor
until
their
work
was
done
but
this
period
did
not
last
long
for
the
tide
of
emigration

sweeping

the

the
market

constantly
growing

expanding

the
monopolist
was
unknown
and
the
of
the
lumber
trust
still
sleeping
in
the
womb
of
the
future
so
passed
the
not
unhappy
period
when
opportunity
was
open
to
everyone
when
freedom
was
dear
to
the
hearts
of
all
it
was
at
this
time
that
the
spirit
of
real
americanism
was
born
when
the
clean
sturdy
name
america
spelled
freedom
justice
and
independence
patriotism
in
these
days
was
not
a
mask
for
profiteers
and
murderers
were
not
permitted
to
hide
their
bloody
hands
in
the
folds
of
their

creeping

fabulous

being
made
as
wealth
was
becoming

into

modern
capitalism
was
entrenching
itself
for
the
final
and
inevitable
struggle
for
world
domination
in
due
time
the
social
parasites
of
the
east
foreseeing
that
the
forests
of
maine
michigan
and
wisconsin
could
not
last
forever
began
to
look

the
history
of
the
acquisition
of
the
forests
of
washington
montana
idaho
oregon
and
california
is
a
long
sordid
story
of
thinly
veiled
robbery
and
intrigue
the
methods
of
the
lumber
barons
in
invading
and
seizing
its
holdings
did
not
differ
greatly
however
from
those
of
the
steel
and
oil
kings
the
railroad
magnates
or
any
of
the
other
industrial
potentates
who
acquired
great
wealth
by
pilfering
america
and
peonizing
its
people
the
whole
sorry
proceeding
was
disgraceful
and
treacherous
and
only
made
possible
by
reason
of
the
blindness
of
the
generous
american
people
drugged
with
the
vanishing
hope
of
success
and
too
confident
of
the
continued
possession
of
its
liberties
and
do
the
lumber
barons
were
unhindered
in
their
infamous
work
of
debauchery
bribery
murder
and
brazen
fraud
as
a
result
the
monopoly
of
the
northwestern
woods
became
an
established
fact
the
lumber
trust
came
into
its
own
the
new
social
alignment
was
complete
with
the
idle
absentee
landlord
at
one
end
and
the
migratory
and
possessionless
lumber
jack
at
the
other
the
parasites
had
appropriated
to
themselves
the
standing
timber
of
the
northwest
but
the
brawny
logger
whose
labor
had
made
possible
the
development
of
the
industry
was
given
as
his
share
of
the
spoils
a
crumby
bindle
and
a
rebellious
heart
the
masters
had
gained
undisputed
control
of
the
timber
of
the
country
three
quarters
of
which
is
located
in
the
northwest
but
the
workers
who
felled
the
trees
drove
the
logs
dressed
finished
and
loaded
the
lumber
were
left
in
the
state
of
helpless
dependency
from
which
they
could
only
extricate
themselves
by
means
of
organization
and
it
is
this
effort
to
form
a
union
and
establish
union
headquarters
that
led
to
the
tragedy
at
centralia
the
lumber
barons
had
not
only
achieved
a
monopoly
of
the
woods
but
a
perfect
feudal
domination
of
the
woods
as
well
within
their
domain
banks
ships
railways
and
mills
bore
their
private
politicians
employers
associations
preachers
newspapers
fraternal
orders
and
judges
and
were
always
at
their
beck
and
call
the
power
they
wield
is
tremendous
and
their
profits
would
ransom
a
kingdom
naturally
they
did
not
intend
to
permit
either
power
or
profits
to
be
menaced
by
a
mass
of
slaves
in
stag
shirts
and
overalls
and
so
the
struggle
waxed
fiercer
just
as
the
lumberjack
learned
to
contend
successfully
for
living
conditions
and
adequate
remuneration
it
was
the
old
old
conflict
of
human
rights
against
property

called
a
spar
tree
very
necessary
in
a
certain
kind
of
logging
operations
as
soon
as
the
portion
falls
the
trunk
vibrates
rapidly
from
side
to
side
sometimes
shaking
the
logger
to
certain
death
below
opposing
this
colossal
aggregation
of
wealth
and
cussedness
were
the
thousands
of
and
exploited
lumberworkers
in
the
woods
and
sawmills
these
had
neither
wealth
nor
influence
nothing
but
their
hard
bare
hands
and
a
growing
sense
of
solidarity
and
the
masters
of
the
forests
were
more
afraid
of
this
solidarity
than
anything
else
in
the
world
and
they
fought
it
more
bitterly
as
events
will
show
centralia
is
only
one
of
the
incidents
of
this
struggle
between
owner
and
worker
but
let
us
see
what
this
hated
and
indispensable
productive
and
human
basis
of
the
lumber
industry
the
man
who
made
all
these
things
possible
is
like
the
human
element
the
timber
beast
lumber
workers
are
by
nature
of
their
employment
divided
into
two
categories
the
hand
and
the
logger
the
former
like
his
brothers
in
the
eastern
factories
is
an
indoor
type
while
the
latter
is
essentially
a
man
of
the
open
air
both
types
are
necessary
to
the
production
of
finished
lumber
and
to
both
union
organization
is
an
imperative
necessity
sawmill
work
is
machine
work
rapid
tedious
and
often
dangerous
there
is
the
uninteresting
repetition
of
the
same
act
of
motions
day
in
and
day
out
the
sights
sounds
and
smells
of
the
mill
are
never
varied
the
fact
that
the
mill
is
permanently
located
tends
to
keep
mill
workers
grouped
about
the
place
of
their
employment
many
of
them
especially
in
the
shingle
mills
have
lost
fingers
or
hands
in
feeding
the
lumber
to
the
screaming
saws
it
has
been
estimated
that
fully
a
half
of
these
men
are
married
and
remain
settled
in
the
mill
communities
the
other
half
however
are
not
nearly
so
migratory
as
the
lumberjack
sawmill
workers
are
not
the
of
the
industry
they
are
of
the
more
conservative
element
and
characterized
by
the
psychology
of
all
factory
workers
the
logger
on
the
other
hand
and
it
is
with
him
our
narrative
is
chiefly
concerned
is
accustomed
to
hard
and
hazardous
work
in
the
open
woods
his
occupation
makes
him
of
necessity
migratory
the
camp
following
the
uncut
timber
from
place
to
place
makes
it
impossible
for
him
to
acquire
a
family
and
settle
down
scarcely
one
out
of
ten
has
ever
dared
assume
the
responsibility
of
matrimony
the
necessity
of
shipping
from
a
central
point
in
going
from
one
job
to
another
usually
forces
a
migratory
existence
upon
the
lumberjack
in
spite
of
his
best
intentions
to
live
otherwise
what
is
a
casual
laborer
the
problem
of
the
logger
is
that
of
the
casual
laborer
in
general
broadly
speaking
there
are
three
distinct
classes
of
casual
laborers
first
the
harvest
stiff
of
the
middle
west
who
follows
the
ripening
crops
from
kansas
to
the
dakotas
finding
winter
employment
in
the
north
middle
western
woods
in
construction
camps
or
on
the
ice
fields
then
there
is
the
harvest
worker
of
the
coast
who
garners
the
fruit
hops
and
grain
and
does
the
canning
of
california
washington
and
oregon
finding
employment
wherever
possible
finally
there
is
the
northwestern
logger
whose
work
unlike
that
of
the
middle
western
jack
is
not
seasonal
but
who
is
compelled
nevertheless
to
remain
migratory
as
a
rule
however
his
habitat
is
confined
according
to
preference
or
force
of
circumstances
to
either
the
long
log
country
of
western
washington
and
oregon
as
well
as
california
or
to
the
short
log
country
of
eastern
washington
and
oregon
northern
idaho
and
western
montana
minnesota
michigan
and
wisconsin
are
in
what
is
called
the
short
log
region
illustration
a
logger
of
the
pacific
northwest
this
is
a
type
of
the
men
who
work
in
the
long
log
region
of
the
west
coast
his
is
a
man
sized
job
and
his
efforts
to
organize
and
better
the
working
conditions
in
the
lumber
industry
have
been
manly
efforts
and
bitterly
opposed
as
a
rule
the
logger
of
the
northwest
follows
the
woods
to
the
exclusion
of
all
other
employment
he
is
militantly
a
lumberjack
and
is
inclined
to
be
a
trifle
patriotic
and
disputatious
as
to
the
relative
importance
of
his
own
particular
branch
of
the
industry
long
loggers
for
instance
view
with
a
suspicion
of
disdain
the
work
of
short
loggers
and
vice
versa
the
giant
killer
but
the
is
a
casual
worker
and
he
is
the
finished
product
of
modern
capitalism
he
is
the
perfect
proletarian
type
possessionless
homeless
and
rebellious
he
is
the
reverse
side
of
the
gilded
medal
of
present
day
society
on
the
one
side
is
the
third
generation
idle
rich
arrogant
and
parasitical
and
on
the
other
the
actual
producer
economically
helpless
and
denied
access
to
the
means
of
production
unless
he
beg
his
lordly
fellow
worm
to
give
him
leave
to
toil
as
robert
burns
has
it
the
logger
of
the
northwest
has
his
faults
he
is
not
any
more
perfect
than
the
rest
of
us
the
years
of
degradation
and
struggle
he
has
endured
in
the
woods
have
not
failed
to
leave
their
mark
upon
him
but
as
the
wage
workers
go
he
is
not
the
common
but
the
uncommon
type
both
as
regards
physical
strength
and
cleanliness
and
mental
alertness
he
is
generous
to
a
fault
and
has
all
the
qualities
lincoln
and
whitman
loved
in
men
in
the
first
place
whether
as
faller
rigging
man
or
on
the
drive
his
work
is
muscular
and
out
of
doors
he
must
at
all
times
conquer
the
forest
and
battle
with
the
elements
there
is
a
tang
and
adventure
to
his
labor
in
the
impressive
solitude
of
the
woods
that
gives
him
a
steady
eye
a
strong
arm
and
a
clear
brain
being
constantly
close
to
the
great
green
heart
of
nature
he
acquires
the
dignity
and
independence
of
the
savage
rather
than
the
passive
and
unresisting
submission
of
the
factory
worker
the
fact
that
he
is
free
from
family
ties
also
tends
to
make
him
ready
for
an
industrial
frolic
or
fight
at
any
time
in
daily
matching
his
prowess
and
skill
with
the
products
of
the
earth
he
feels
in
a
way
that
the
woods
belong
to
him
and
develops
a
contempt
for
the
unseen
and
unknown
employers
who
kindly
permit
him
to
enrich
them
with
his
labor
he
is
constantly
reminded
of
the
glaring
absurdity
of
the
private
ownership
of
natural
resources
instinctively
he
becomes
a
rebel
against
the
injustice
and
contradictions
of
capitalist
society
dwarfed
to
insignificance
by
the
verdant
immensity
around
him
the
logger
toils
daily
with
ax
saw
and
cable
one
after
another
forest
giants
of
dizzy
height
crash
to
the
earth
with
a
sound
like
thunder
in
a
short
time
they
are
loaded
on
flat
cars
and
hurried
across
the
clearing
to
the
river
whence
they
are
dispatched
to
the
noisy
saws
at
the
mill
and
always
the
logger
knows
in
his
heart
that
this
is
not
done
that
people
may
have
lumber
for
their
needs
but
rather
that
some
overfed
parasite
may
first
add
to
his
holy
dividends
production
for
profit
always
strikes
the
logger
with
the
full
force
of
objective
observation
and
is
it
any
wonder
with
the
process
of
exploitation
thus
naked
always
before
his
eyes
that
he
should
have
been
among
the
very
first
workers
to
challenge
the
flimsy
title
of
the
lumber
barons
to
the
private
ownership
of
the
woods
the
factory
worker
and
the
without
wishing
to
disparage
the
ultimate
worth
of
either
it
might
be
well
to
contrast
for
a
moment
the
factory
worker
of
the
east
with
the
of
the
pacific
northwest
to
the
factory
hand
the
claim
to
the
exclusive
title
of
the
means
of
production
is
not
so
evidently
absurd
around
him
are
huge
smoking
buildings
filled
with
roaring
machinery
all
as
a
rule
he
simply
takes
for
granted
that
his
employers
whoever
they
are
own
these
just
as
he
himself
owns
for
instance
his
pipe
or
his
furniture
only
when
he
learns
from
thoughtful
observation
or
study
that
such
things
are
the
appropriated
products
of
the
labor
of
himself
and
his
kind
does
the
truth
dawn
upon
him
that
labor
produces
all
and
is
entitled
to
its
own
illustration
logging
operations
look
around
you
at
the
present
moment
and
you
will
see
wood
used
for
many
different
purposes
have
you
ever
stopped
to
think
where
the
raw
material
comes
from
or
what
the
workers
are
like
who
produce
it
here
is
a
scene
from
a
lumber
camp
showing
the
loggers
at
their
daily
tasks
the
lumber
trust
is
willing
that
these
men
should
not
organize
it
must
be
admitted
that
factory
life
tends
to
dispirit
and
cow
the
workers
who
spend
their
lives
in
the
gloomy
confines
of
the
modern
mill
or
shop
obedient
to
the
shrill
whistle
they
pour
out
of
their
clustered
grey
dwellings
in
the
early
morning
out
of
the
labor
ghettos
they
swarm
and
into
their
dismal
then
the
long
monotonous
daily
grind
and
home
again
to
repeat
the
identical
proceeding
on
the
following
day
almost
always
tired
trained
to
harsh
discipline
or
content
with
low
comfort
they
are
all
too
liable
to
feel
that
capitalism
is
invincibly
colossal
and
that
the
possibility
of
a
better
day
is
hopelessly
remote
most
of
them
are
unacquainted
with
their
neighbors
they
live
in
small
family
or
boarding
house
units
and
having
no
common
meeting
place
realize
only
with
difficulty
the
mighty
potency
of
their
vast
numbers
to
them
organization
appears
desirable
at
times
but
unattainable
the
dickering
conservatism
of
craft
unionism
appeals
to
their
cautious
natures
they
act
only
en
masse
under
awful
compulsion
and
then
their
release
of
repressed
slave
emotion
is
sudden
and
terrible
not
so
with
the
husky
of
the
northwestern
woods
his
job
life
is
a
group
life
he
walks
to
his
daily
task
with
his
fellow
workers
he
is
seldom
employed
for
long
away
from
them
at
a
common
table
he
eats
with
them
and
they
all
sleep
in
common
bunk
houses
the
trees
themselves
teach
him
to
scorn
his
master
adventitious
claim
to
exclusive
ownership
the
circumstances
of
his
daily
occupation
show
him
the
need
of
class
solidarity
his
strong
body
clamours
constantly
for
the
sweetness
and
comforts
of
life
that
are
denied
him
his
alert
brain
urges
him
to
organize
and
his
independent
spirit
gives
him
the
courage
and
tenacity
to
achieve
his
aims
the
union
hall
is
often
his
only
home
and
the
one
big
union
his
he
is
fond
of
reading
and
discussion
he
resents
industrial
slavery
as
an
insult
he
resented
filth
overwork
and
poverty
he
resented
being
made
to
carry
his
own
bundle
of
blankets
from
job
to
job
he
gritted
his
teeth
together
and
fought
until
he
had
ground
these
obnoxious
things
under
his
heel
the
lumber
trust
hated
him
just
in
proportion
as
he
gained
and
used
his
industrial
power
but
neither
curses
promises
nor
blows
could
make
him
budge
he
knew
what
he
wanted
and
he
knew
how
to
get
what
he
wanted
and
his
boss
did
like
it
very
well
the
is
secretive
and
not
given
to
expressed
emotion
excepting
in
his
union
songs
the
bosses
do
like
his
songs
either
but
the
logger
is
worried
a
bit
working
away
in
the
woods
every
day
or
in
his
bunk
at
night
he
dreams
his
dream
of
the
world
as
he
thinks
it
should
be
that
wild
wobbly
dream
that
every
passing
day
brings
closer
to
realization
and
he
wants
all
who
work
around
him
to
share
his
vision
and
his
determination
to
win
so
that
all
will
be
ready
and
worthy
to
live
in
the
new
day
that
is
dawning
in
a
word
the
northwestern
was
too
human
and
too
stubborn
ever
to
repudiate
his
manhood
at
the
behest
of
his
masters
and
become
a
serf
his
union
meant
to
him
all
that
he
possessed
or
hoped
to
gain
is
it
any
wonder
that
he
endured
the
tortures
of
hell
during
the
period
of
the
war
rather
than
yield
his
red
card
or
that
he
is
still
determined
and
still
undefeated
is
it
any
wonder
the
lumber
barons
hated
him
and
sought
to
break
his
spirit
with
brute
force
and
legal
cunning
or
that
they
conspired
to
murder
it
at
centralia
with
mob
violence
and
failed
why
the
loggers
organized
the
condition
of
the
logger
previous
to
the
period
of
organization
beggars
description
modern
industrial
autocracy
seemed
with
him
to
develop
its
most
inhuman
characteristics
the
evil
plant
of
wage
slavery
appeared
to
bear
its
most
noxious
blossoms
in
the
woods
the
hours
of
labor
were
unendurably
long
ten
hours
being
the
general
rule
with
the
exception
of
the
grays
harbor
district
where
the
eleven
or
even
twelve
hour
day
prevailed
in
addition
to
this
men
were
compelled
to
walk
considerable
distances
to
and
from
their
work
and
meals
through
the
wet
brush
not
infrequently
the
noon
lunch
was
made
almost
impossible
because
of
the
order
to
be
back
on
the
job
when
work
commenced
a
ten
hour
stretch
of
arduous
labor
in
a
climate
where
incessant
rain
is
the
rule
for
at
least
six
months
of
the
year
was
enough
to
try
the
strength
and
patience
of
even
the
strongest
the
wages
too
were
pitiably
inadequate
the
camps
themselves
always
more
or
less
temporary
affairs
were
inferior
to
the
accommodations
of
a
cattle
ranch
the
bunk
house
were
and
unsanitary
in
these
ramshackle
affairs
the
loggers
were
packed
like
sardines
the
bunks
were
arranged
tier
over
tier
and
nearly
always
without
mattresses
they
were
uniformly
and
sometimes
of
the
variety
no
blankets
were
furnished
each
logger
being
compelled
to
supply
his
own
there
were
no
facilities
for
bathing
or
the
washing
and
drying
of
sweaty
clothing
lighting
and
ventilation
were
of
course
always
poor
in
addition
to
these
discomforts
the
unorganized
logger
was
charged
a
monthly
hospital
fee
for
imaginary
medical
service
also
it
was
nearly
always
necessary
to
pay
for
the
opportunity
of
enjoying
these
privileges
by
purchasing
employment
from
a
job
shark
or
securing
the
good
graces
of
a
man
catcher
the
former
often
had
business
agreements
with
the
camp
foreman
and
in
many
cases
a
man
could
not
get
a
job
unless
he
had
a
ticket
from
a
labor
agent
in
some
shipping
point
it
may
be
said
that
the
conditions
just
described
were
more
prevalent
in
some
parts
of
the
lumber
country
than
in
others
nevertheless
these
prevailed
pretty
generally
in
all
sections
of
the
industry
before
the
workers
attempted
to
better
them
by
organizing
at
all
events
such
were
the
conditions
the
lumber
barons
sought
with
all
their
power
to
preserve
and
the
loggers
to
change
organization
and
the
opening
struggle
a
few
years
before
the
birth
of
the
industrial
workers
of
the
world
the
lumber
workers
had
started
to
organize
by
when
the
above
mentioned
union
was
launched
were
already
united
in
considerable
numbers
in
the
old
western
afterwards
the
american
labor
union
this
organization
took
steps
to
affiliate
with
the
industrial
workers
of
the
world
and
was
thus
among
the
very
first
to
seek
a
larger
share
of
life
in
the
ranks
of
that
militant
and
maligned
organization
strike
followed
strike
with
varying
success
and
the
conditions
of
the
loggers
began
perceptibly
to
improve
scattered
here
and
there
in
the
cities
of
the
northwest
were
many
locals
of
the
industrial
workers
of
the
world
not
until
however
were
these
consolidated
into
a
real
industrial
unit
for
the
first
time
a
sufficient
number
of
loggers
and
saw
mill
men
were
organized
to
be
grouped
into
an
integral
part
of
the
one
big
union
this
was
done
with
reasonable
success
in
the
following
year
the
american
federation
of
labor
attempted
a
similar
task
but
without
lasting
results
the
loggers
preferring
the
industrial
to
the
craft
form
of
organization
besides
this
they
were
predisposed
to
sympathize
with
the
ideal
of
solidarity
and
industrial
democracy
for
which
their
own
union
had
stood
from
the
beginning
the
timber
beast
was
starting
to
reap
the
benefits
of
his
organized
power
also
he
was

arrayed

he
was
soon
to
learn
that
the
path
of
labor
unionism
is
strewn
with
more
rocks

emerge
from
the
squalor

misery
of
peonage

soon

that
his

were
satisfied
to
keep
him
right
where
he
had
always
been
strange
to
say
almost
the
first
really
important
clash
occurred
in
the
very
heart
of
the

not
to

this
was
in
a
strike
had
started
in
the
saw
mills
over
demands
of
a
daily
wage
some
of
the

mill
workers
were
members
of
the
industrial
workers
of
the
world
they
were
supported
by
the
union
loggers
of
western
washington
the
struggle
was
bitterly
contested
and
lasted
for
several
weeks
the
lumber
trust
bared
its
fangs
and
struck
viciously
at
the
workers
in
a
manner
that
has
since
characterized
its
tactics
in
all
labor
disputes
the
jails
of
aberdeen
and
adjoining
towns
were
filled
with
strikers
picket
lines
were
broken
up
and
the
pickets
arrested
when
the
wives
of
the
strikers
with
babies
in
their
arms
took
the
places
of
their
imprisoned
husbands
the

was
turned
on
them
with
great

in

instances
knocking
them

loggers
and

alike
were
unmercifully
beaten
many
were

by
mobs
with
pick
handles
taken
to
the
outskirts
of
the
city
and
told
that
their
return
would
be
the
occasion
of
a
lynching
at
one
time
an
armed
mob
of
business
men
dragged
nearly
four
hundred
strikers
from
their
homes
or
boarding
houses
herded
them
into
waiting
boxcars
sealed
up
the
doors
and
were
about
to
deport
them

the

getting

of
this
proceeding
stopped
it

were
badly
scarred
by
beatings
they

one

was
crippled
for

by
the
brutal
treatment
accorded
him
but
the
strikers
won
their
demands
and
conditions
were
materially
improved
the
industrial
workers
of
the
world
continued
to
grow
in
numbers
and
prestige
this
event
may
be
considered
the
beginning
of
the
labor
movement
on
grays
harbor
that
the
lumber
trust
sought
finally
to
crush
with
mob
violence
on
a
certain
memorable
day
in
centralia
seven
years
later
following
the
aberdeen
strike
one
or
two
minor
clashes
occurred
the
lumber
workers
were
usually
successful
during
this
period
they
were
quietly
but
effectually
spreading
one
big
union
propaganda
throughout
the
camps
and
mills
in
the
district
also
they
were
organizing
their
fellow
workers
in
increasing
numbers
into
their
union
the
lumber
trust
smarting
under
its
last
defeat
was
alarmed

that
after
a
summer
replete
with
illegal
beatings

five
men
were
killed
in
cold
blood
and
forty
wounded
in
a
final
desperate
effort
to
drive
the

out
of

these

were
slaughtered
and
wounded
by
the

of
a
gang
of
business
men
and
of
the
lumber
interests
true
to
form
the
lumber

had
every

man
in
sight
arrested
and
charged
with
the
murder
of
a

who
had
been
killed
by

none
of
the
desperadoes
who
had

was
ever
prosecuted
or
even
reprimanded
the
charge
against
the

was
pressed
the

was

declared
not

the

were
infuriated
at
their
defeat
and
from
this
time
on
the
struggle
raged
in
deadly
earnest
almost
everything
from
mob
law
to
open
assassination
had
been
tried
without

the
execrated
one
big

was
gaining

every

the

was
truly
alarming
their

workingmen
were
waking
up
they
were
in
appalling
numbers
demanding
the

something
must
be
done
something
new
and
drastic
to
split
asunder
this
phalanx
of

power

the
method
was
discarded
temporarily
at

in
favor
of
the
machinations

the
law
making
bodies
big
business
can
make
laws
as
easily
as
it
can
break
them
and
with
as
little
impunity
so
the
notorious
washington
criminal
syndicalism
law
was
devised
this
law
however
struck
a
snag
the
governor
of
the
state
recognizing
its
transparent
character
and
effects
promptly
vetoed
the
measure
after
the
death
of
governor
lister
the
criminal
syndicalism
law
was
passed
however
by
the
next
state
legislature
since
that
time
it
has
been
used
against
the
american
federation
of
labor
the
industrial
workers
of
the
world
the
socialist
party
and
even
common
citizens
not
affiliated
with
any
of
these
organizations
the
criminal
syndicalism
law
registers
the
high

mark
of
reaction
it
infringes
more
on
the
liberties
of

than
any

the
history

the
lumber
industry
strike
for
the
eight
hour
day
for
years
the

and

had
fought
against
the
unrestrained
greed
of
the
lumber
interests
step
by
step
in
the
face
of
fiercest
opposition
they
had
fought
for
the
right
to
live
like
men
and
step

they
had
been
gaining
each
failure
or
success
had
shown
them
the
weakness
or
the
strength
of
their
union
they
had
been
consolidating
their
forces
as
well
as
learning
how
to
use
them
the
lumber
trust
had
been
making
huge
profits
the
while
but
the
lumber
workers
were
still
working
ten
hours
or
more
and
the
logger
was
still
packing
his
dirty
blankets
from
job
to
job
dissatisfaction
with
conditions
was
wider
and
more
prevalent
then
ever
before
then
came
the

soon
as
this
country
had
taken
its
stand
with
the
allied
imperialists
the
price
of
lumber
needed
for
war
purposes
was
boosted
to
sky
high
figures
from
to
per
thousand
feet
is
quite
a
jump
but
recent
disclosures
show
that
the
government
paid
as
high
as
per
thousand
for
spruce
that
private
concerns
were
purchasing
for
less

one
tenth

are
alleged
to
have
been
instrumental
in
enabling
the
patriotic
lumber
trust
to
put
these
little
deals
across
due
to
the
duplicity
of
this
same
bunch
of
predatory
gentlemen
the

turned
out

be

trite
the

has
become
from

the
same
cause
the
boys
at
centralia
were
conspired
against
because
they
too
stood
for
the
solidarity
of
labor
it
is
simply
lying
and
camouflage
to
attempt
to
trace
such
persecutions
to
any
other
source
these
are
things
america
will
be
ashamed
of
when
she
comes
to
her
senses
such
gruesome
events
are
paralleled
in
no
country
save
the
germany
of
kaiser
wilhelm
or
the
russia
of
the
czar
this
picture
of
labor
persecution
in
free
america
terrible
but
true
will
serve
as
a
background
for
the
dramatic
history
of
the
events
leading
up
to
the
climactic
tragedy
at
centralia
on
armistice
day
while
in
washington
all
over
the
state
of
washington
the
mobbing
jailing
and
tar
and
feathering
of
workers
continued
the
order
of
the
day
until
long
after
the
cessation
of
hostilities
in
europe
the
organization
had
always
urged
and
disciplined
its
members
to
avoid
violence
as
an
unworthy
weapon
usually
the
loggers
have
left
their
halls
to
the
mercy
of
the
mobs
when
they
knew
a
raid
was
contemplated
centralia
is
the
one
exception
here
the
outrages
heaped
upon
them
could
be
no
longer
endured
in
yakima
and
sedro
woolley
among
other
places
in
union
men
were
stripped
of
their
clothing
beaten
with
rope
ends
and
hot
tar
applied
to
the
bleeding
flesh
they
were
then
driven
half
naked
into
the
woods
a
man
was
hanged
at
night
in
south
montesano
about
this
time
and
another
had
been
tarred
and
feathered
as
a
rule
the
men
were
taken
unaware
before
being
treated
in
this
manner
in
one
instance
a
stationary
delegate
of
the
industrial
workers
of
the
world
received
word
that
he
was
to
be
decorated
and
rode
out
of
town
on
a
rail
he
slit
a
pillow
open
and
placed
it
in
the
window
with
a
note
attached
stating
that
he
knew
of
the
plan
would
be
ready
for
them
and
would
gladly
supply
his
own
feathers
he
did
not
leave
town
either
on
a
rail
or
otherwise
in
seattle
tacoma
and
many
other
towns
union
halls
and
print
shops
were
raided
and
their
contents
destroyed
or
burned
in
the
former
city
in
men
women
and
children
were
knocked
insensible
by
policemen
and
detectives
riding
up
and
down
the
sidewalks
in
automobiles
striking
to
right
and
left
with
billy
and
night
stick
as
they
went
these
were
accompanied
by
auto
trucks
filled
with
hidden
riflemen
and
an
armored
tank
bristling
with
machine
guns
a
peaceable
meeting
of

years
old
loren

said
of
him
at

trial
loren
was
a
good
boy
he
brought
his
money
home
regularly
for
three
years
after
his
father
took
sick
he
was
the
only
support
for
his
father
and
me
and
the
three
younger
ones
the
father
was
a
sawyer
in
a
mill
and
died
of
tuberculosis
after
an
accident
had
broken
his
strength
this
boy
the
weakest
of
the
men
on
trial
was
driven
insane
by
the
unspeakable
third
degree
administered
in
the
city

one
of
the
lumber

lawyers
was
in
the
jail
at
the
time
roberts

the

attorney
in

condition
roberts
was
one
of
the
loggers
on
seminary
hill
in
centralia
aberdeen
and
montesano
in
grays
harbor
county
the
struggle
was
more
local
but
not
less
intense
no
fewer
than
loggers
on
different
occasions
were
taken
from
their
beds
at
night
and
treated
to
tar
and
feathers
a
great
number
were
jailed
for
indefinite
periods
on
indefinite
charges
as
an
additional
punishment
these
were
frequently
locked
in
their
cells
and
the
fire
hose
played
on
their
drenched
and
shivering
bodies
breech
of
jail
discipline
was
the
reason
given
for
this
cruel
and
unusual
form
of
lumber
trust
punishment
in
aberdeen
and
montesano
there
were
several
raids
and
many
deportations
of
the
tar
and
feather
variety
in
aberdeen
in
the
fall
of
during
a
patriotic
parade
the
battered
hall
of
the
union
loggers
was
again
forcibly
entered
in
the
absence
of
its
owners
furniture
office
fixtures
victrola
and
books
were
dumped
into
the
street
and
destroyed
in
the
town
of
centralia
about
a
year
before
the
tragedy
the
union
secretary
was
kidnapped
and
taken
into
the
woods
by
a
mob
of
well
dressed
business
men
he
was
made
to
run
the
gauntlet
and
severely
beaten
there
was
a
strong
sentiment
in
favor
of
lynching
him
on
the
spot
but
one
of
the
mob
objected
saying
it
would
be
too
raw
the
victim
was
then
escorted
to
the
outskirts
of
the
city
and
warned
not
to
return
under
pain
of
usual
penalty
on
more
than
one
occasion
loggers
who
had
expressed
themselves
in
favor
of
the
industrial

of
the

were
found
in
the
morning
dangling
from
trees
in
the
neighborhood

explanation
but
that
of
suicide
was
ever
offered
the
whole
story
of
the
atrocities
perpetrated
during
these
days
of
the
white
terror
in
all
probability
will
never
be
published
the
criminals
are
all
well
known
but
their
influence
is
too
powerful
to
ever
make
it
expedient
to
expose
their
crimes
besides
who
would
care
to
get
a
gentleman
in
trouble
for
killing
a
mere
wobbly
the
few
instances
noted
above
will
however
give
the
reader
some
slight
idea
of
the
gruesome
events
that
were
leading
inevitably
to
that
grim
day
in
centralia
in
november
weathering
the
storm
through
it
all
the
industrialists
clung
to
their
red
cards
and
to
the
one
big
union
for
which
they
had
sacrificed
so
much
time
after
time
with
incomparable
patience
they
would
refurnish
and
reopen
their
beleaguered
halls
heal
up
the
wounds
of
rope
tar
or
billy
and
proceed
with
the
work
of
organization
as
though
nothing
had
happened
with
union
cards
or
credentials
hidden
in
their
heavy
shoes
they
would
meet
secretly
in
the
woods
at
night
here
they
would
consult
about
members
who
had
been
mobbed
jailed
or
killed
about
caring
for
their
families
if
they
had
any
about
carrying
on
the
work
of
propaganda
and
laying
plans
for
the
future
progress
of
their
union
perhaps
they
would
take
time
to
chant
a
rebel
song
or
two
in
low
voices
then
back
on
the
job
again
to
line
up
the
slaves
for
the
new
society
through
a
veritable
inferno
of
torment
and
persecution
these
men
had
refused
to
be
driven
from
the
woods
or
to
give
up
their
union
the
industrial
workers
of
the
world
between
the
two
dreadful
alternatives
of
peonage
or
persecution
they
chose
the
latter
and
the
lesser
can
you
imagine
what
their
peonage
must
have
been
like
sinister
centralia
but
centralia
was
destined
to
be
the
scene
of
the
most
dramatic
portion
of
the
struggle
between
the
entrenched
interests
and
the
union
loggers
here
the
long
persecuted
industrialists
made
a
stand
for
their
lives
and
fought
to
defend
their
own
thus
giving
the
lawyers
of
the
prosecution
the
opportunity
of
accusing
them
of
wantonly
murdering
unoffending
paraders
on
armistice
day

appearance
is
a
creditable
small

centralia
is
somewhat
of
a
coquette
but
she
is
as
sinister
and
cowardly
as
she
is

is
a
shudder
lurking
in

a
nameless
fear
sucks
the
sweetness
out
of
every
breeze

warble
at
the
outskirts

one
is
always
haunted
by
the
cries

human
beings
who
have
been
tortured
and
killed
within

confines

down
the
wet
street

shouts
a
laughing
greeting
to

well
dressed
group
at
the
curb
who
respond
in
kind
but
the
roughly
dressed
lumberworkers
drop
their
glances
in
passing
one
another
the
fear
is
always
upon
them
as
these
lines
are
written
several
hundred
discontented
are
threatened
with
deportation
if
they
dare
to
strike
they
will
not
strike
for
they
know
too
well
the
consequences
the
of
a
few
months
ago
is
not
forgotten
and
the
terror
of
it
grips
their
hearts
whenever
they
think
of
opposing
the
will
of
the
moloch
that
dominates
their
every
move

three
of

and
cassagranda
were
killed
in
the
immediate
vicinity
of

doorway
several
others
were
wounded
while
attempting
to
rush
the
doors
these
halls
are
at
all
times
open
to
the
public
and
inducements
are
made
to
get
workers
to
come
in
and
read
a
thoughtful
treatise
on
industrial
questions
the
is
always
out
for
people
who
care
to
listen
to
a
lecture
on
economics
or
similar
subjects
inside
the
hall
there
is
usually
a
long
littered
with
books
magazines
or
papers
in
a
rack
or
case
at
the
wall
are
to
be
found

on
the

are
lithographs

of
noted
champions
of
the
cause
of
labor
a
few
photographs
of
local
interest
and
the
monthly
bulletins

statements
of
the

invariably
there
is
a
blackboard
with
jobs
wages
and
hours
written
in
chalk
for
the
benefit
of
men
seeking
employment
there
are
always
a
number
of
chairs
in
the
room
and
a
roll
top
desk
for
the
secretary
sometimes
at
the
end
of
the
hall
is
a
plank
rostrum
a
modest
altar
to
the
goddess
of
free
speech
and
open
discussion
this
is
what
the
loved
and
hated
halls
are
like
the
halls
that
have
been
raided
and
destroyed
by
the
hundreds
during
the
last
three
years
remember
too
that
in
each
of
these
raids
the
union
men
were
not
the
aggressors
and
that
there
was
never
any
attempt
at
reprisal
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
the
lumber
workers
were
within
their
legal
right
to
keep
open
their
halls
and
to
defend
them
from
felonious
attack
it
had
never
happened
until
november
that
active
resistance
was
offered
the
marauders
this
fact
alone
speaks
volumes
for
the
patience
of
the
logger
and
for
his
desire
to
settle
his
problems
by
peaceable
means
wherever
possible
but
the
centralia
raid
was
the
straw
that
broke
the
camel
back
the
lumber
trust
went
a
little
too
far
on
this
occasion
and
it
got
the
surprise
of
its
life
four
of
its
misguided
dupes
paid
for
their
lawlessness
with
their
lives
and
a
number
of
others
were
wounded
there
has
not
since
been
a
raid
on
a
union
hall
in
the
northwestern
district
it
is
well
that
workingmen
and
women
throughout
the
country
should
understand
the
truth
about
the
armistice
day
tragedy
in
centralia
and
the
circumstances
that
led
up
to
it
but
in
order
to
know
why
the
hall
was
raided
it
is
necessary
first
to
understand
why
this
and
all
similar
halls
are
hated
by
the
oligarchies
of
the
woods
the
issue
contested
is
whether
the
loggers
have
the
right
to
organize
themselves
into
a
union
or
whether
they
must
remain
chattels
mere
hewers
of
wood
and
helpless
in
the
face
of
the
rapacity
of
their
industrial
overlords
or
whether
they
have
the
right
to
keep
open
their
halls
and
peacefully
to
conduct
the
affairs
of
their
union
the
lumber
workers
contend
that
they
are
entitled
by
law
to
do
these
things
and
the
employers
assert
that
law
or
no
law
they
shall
not
do
so
in
other
words
it
is
a
question
of
whether
labor
organization
shall
retain
its
foothold
in
the
lumber
industry
or
be
driven
from
the
woods
pioneers
of
unionism
it
is
hard
for
workers
in
most
of
the
other
industries
especially
in
the
east
to
understand
the
problems
struggles
and
aspirations
of
the
husky
and
unconquerable
lumber
workers
of
the
northwest
the
reason
is
that
the
average
union
man
takes
his
union
for
granted
he
goes
to
his
union
meetings
discusses
the
affairs
of
his
craft
industry
or
class
and
he
carries
his
card
all
as
a
matter
of
course
it
seldom
enters
his
mind
that
the
privileges
and
benefits
that
surround
him
and
the
protection
he
enjoys
are
the
result
of
the
efforts
and
sacrifices
of
the
nameless
thousands
of
pioneers
that
cleared
the
way
but
these
unknown
heroes
of
the
great
struggle
of
the
classes
did
precede
him
with
their
loyal
hearts
and
strong
hands
otherwise
workers
now
organized
would
have
to
start
the
long
hard
battle
at
the
beginning
and
count
their
gains
a
step
at
a
time
just
as
did
the
early
champions
of
industrial
organization
or
as
the
loggers
of
the
west
coast
are
now
doing
the
working
class
owes
all
honor
and
respect
to
the
first
men
who
planted
the
standard
of
labor
solidarity
on
the
hostile
frontier
of
unorganized
industry
they
were
the
men
who
made
possible
all
things
that
came
after
and
all
things
that
are
still
to
come
they
were
the
trail
blazers
it
is
easier
to
follow
them
than
to
have
gone
before
them
or
with
them
they
established
the
outposts
of
unionism
in
the
wilderness
of
industrial
autocracy
their
voices
were
the
first
to
proclaim
the
burning
message
of
labor
power
of
labor
mission
and
of
labor
ultimate
emancipation
their
breasts
were
the
first
to
receive
the
blows
of
the
enemy
their
unprotected
bodies
were
shielding
the
countless
thousands
to
follow
they
were
the
forerunners
of
the
solidarity
of
toil
they
fought
in
a
good
and
great
cause
for
without
solidarity
labor
would
have
attained
nothing
yesterday
gained
nothing
today
nor
dare
to
hope
for
anything
tomorrow

as
our

had
to

the

so
are
these

called
upon
to
face
the
fury
of

have
usurped

of

just

stands
a

it
is
an
old
brown
dilapidated
block

of
early

in
many
ways
it
reminds
one
of
the
battered
and
wrecked
union
halls
to
be
found
in
the
heart
of
the
city
the
evolution
of
industry
has
replaced
the
block
house
with
the
union

as
the
embattled
center
of
assault
and
defense
the
weapons
are
no
longer
the

and
the
tomahawk
but
the
boycott
and
the

the

is
no

territorial
but
industrial
the
new

is
as
portentous
as
the
old
the
stakes
are
larger
and
the
warfare
even
more
bitter
the
painted

of
the

or

were
not
more
heartless
in
maiming
mutilating
and
killing
their
victims
than
the

the
type
of
men
who
conceived
the

on

in
centralia
on
armistice
day
and
who
fiendishly
tortured
and
hanged
wesley
everest
for
the
crime
of
defending
himself
from
their
inhuman
rage
it
seems
incredible
that
such
deeds
could
be
possible
in
the
twentieth
century
it
is
incredible
to
those
who
have
not
followed
in
the
bloody
trail
of
the
lumber
trust
and
who
are
not
familiar
with
its
ruthlessness
its
greed
and
its
lust
for
power
as
might
be
expected
the
halls
in
washington
were
hated
by
the
lumber
barons
with
a
deep
and
undying
hatred
union
halls
were
a
standing
challenge
to
their
hitherto
undisputed
right
to
the
complete
domination
of
the
forests
like
the
blockhouses
of
early
days
these
humble
meeting
places
were
the
outposts
of
a
new
and
better
order
planted
in
the
stronghold
of
the
old
and
they
were
hated
accordingly
the
thieves
who
had
invaded
the
resources
of
the
nation
had
long
ago
seized
the
woods
and
still
held
them
in
a
grip
of
steel
they
were
not
going
to
tolerate
the
encroachments
of
the
one
big
union
of
the
lumber
workers
events
will
prove
that
they
did
not
hesitate
at
anything
to
achieve
their
purposes
the
first
centralia
hall
in
the
year
a
union
hall
stood
on
one
of
the
side
streets
in
centralia
it
was
similar
to
the
halls
that
have
just
been
described
this
was
not
however
the
hall
in
which
the
armistice
day
tragedy
took
place
you
must
always
remember
that
there
were
two
halls
raided
in
centralia
one
in
and
another
in
the
loggers
did
not
defend
the
first
hall
and
many
of
them
were
manhandled
by
the
mob
that
wrecked
it
the
loggers
did
defend
the
second
and
were
given
as
reward
a
hanging
a
speedy
fair
and
impartial
conviction
and
sentences
of
from
to
years
no
member
of
the
mob
has
ever
been
punished
or
even
taken
to
task
for
this
misdeed
their
names
are
known
to
everybody
they
kiss
their
wives
and
babies
at
night
and
go
to
church
on
sundays
people
tip
their
hats
to
them
on
the
street
yet
they
are
a
greater
menace
to
the
institutions
of
this
country
than
all
the
reds
in
the
land
in
a
world
where
mammon
is
king
the
king
can
do
no
wrong
but
the
question
of
right
or
wrong
did
not
concern
the
lumber
interests
when
they
raided
the
union
hall
in
yes
we
raided
the
hall
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
it
is
the
position
they
take
in
the
matter
during
the
strike
the
two
lumber
trust
papers
in
centralia
the
hub
and
the
chronicle
were
bitter
in
their
denunciation
of
the
strikers
repeatedly
they
urged
that
most
drastic
and
violent
measures
be
taken
by
the
authorities
and
citizens
to
break
the
strike
smash
the
union
and
punish
the
strikers
the
was
at
its
height
and
these
miserable
sheets
went
about
their
work
like
czarist
papers
inciting
a
pogrom
the
lumber
workers
were
accused
of
disloyalty
treason
anarchy
anything
that
would
tend
to
make
their
cause
unpopular
the
abolitionists
were
spoken
about
in
identical
terms
before
the
civil
war
as
soon
as
the
right
atmosphere
for
their
crime
had
been
created
the
employers
struck
and
struck
hard
it
was
in
april
like
many
other
cities
in
the
land
centralia
was
conducting
a
red
cross
drive
among
the
features
of
this
event
were
a
bazaar
and
a
parade
the
profits
of
the
lumber
trust
were
soaring
to
dizzy
heights
at
this
time
and
their
patriotism
was
proportionately
exalted
there
was
the
usual
brand
of
hypocritical
and
fervid
speechmaking
the
flag
was
waved
the
government
was
lauded
and
the
constitution
praised
then
after
the
proclivities
of
the
heroes
had
been
sufficiently
worked
upon
flag
government
and
constitution
were
forgotten
long
enough
for
the
gang
to
go
down
the
street
and
raid
the
wobbly
hall

the
festivities
was
the
figure
of
hubbard

that
time

of
the

the

it
had
been
rumored
about
town
that
the
union
hall
was
to
be
wrecked
on
this
day
but
the
loggers
at
the
hall
were
of
the
opinion
that
the
business
men
having
driven
their
secretary
out
of
town
a
short
time
previously
would
not
dare
to
perpetrate
another
atrocity
so
soon
afterwards
in
this
they
were
sadly
mistaken
down
the
street
marched
the
parade
at
first
presenting
no
unusual
appearance
the
chief
of

the

and
the
governor
of
the

were
given
places
of
honor
at
the
head
of
the

g
of
the
national
guard
and
a
gang
of
hoodlums
disguised
as
elks
made
up
the
main
body
of
the
marchers
but
the
crafty
and
unscrupulous
hubbard
had
laid
his
plans
in
advance
with
characteristic
cunning
the
parade
like
a
scorpion
carried
its
sting
in
the
rear
along
the
main
avenue
went
the
guardsmen
and
the
gentlemen
of
the

club
so
far
nothing
extraordinary
had
happened
then
the
procession
swerved
to
a

street
this
must
be
the
right
thing
for
the

of
march
had
been
arranged
by
the
chamber
of

itself
a
couple
of
blocks
more
and
the
parade
had
reached
the
intersection
of
first
street
and
tower
avenue
what
happened
then
the
mayor
and
chief
of
police
probably
could
not
have
stopped
even
had
the
governor
himself
ordered
them
to
do
so
from
somewhere
in
the
line
of
march
a
voice
cried
out
raid
the
hall
and
the
crowd
at
the
tail
end
of
the
procession
broke
ranks
and
leaped
to
their
work
with
a
will
in
a
short
time
the
intervening
block
that
separated
them
from
the
union
hall
was
covered
the
building
was
stormed
with
clubs
and
stones
every
window
was
shattered
and
every
door
was
smashed
the
very
sides
of
the
building
were
torn
off
by
the
mob
in
its
blind
fury
inside
the
rioters
tore
down
the
partitions
and
broke
up
chairs
and
pictures
the
union
men
were
surrounded
beaten
and
driven
to
the
street
where
they
were
forced
to
watch
furniture
records
typewriter
and
literature
demolished
and
burned
before
their
eyes
an
american
flag
hanging
in
the
hall
was
torn
down
and
destroyed
a
victrola
and
a
desk
were
carried
to
the
street
with
considerable
care
the
former
was
auctioned
off
on
the
spot

the
benefit
of
the
red

of

won

he
still
boasts

the
desk
was
appropriated
by
hubbard
himself
this
was
turned
over
to
an
expressman
and
carted
to
the
chamber
of
commerce
a
small
boy
picked
up
the
typewriter
case
and
started
to
take
it
to
a
nearby
hotel
office
one
of
the
terrorists
detected
the
act
and
gave
warning
the
mob
seized
the
lad
took
him
to
a
nearby
light
pole
and
threatened
to
lynch
him
if
he
did
not
tell
them
where
books
and
papers
were
secreted
which
somebody
said
had
been
carried
away
by
him
the
boy
denied
having
done
this
but
the
hoodlums
went
into
the
hotel
ransacked
and
overturned
everything
not
finding
what
they
wanted
they
left
a
notice
that
the
proprietor
would
have
to
take
the
sign
down
from
his
building
in
just
hours
then
the
mob
surged
around
the
unfortunate
men
who
had
been
found
in
the
union
hall
with
cuffs
and
blows
these
were
dragged
to
waiting
trucks
where
they
were
lifted
by
the
ears
to
the
body
of
the
machine
and
knocked
prostrate
one
at
a
time
sometimes
a
man
would
be
dropped
to
the
ground
just
after
he
had
been
lifted
from
his
feet
here
he
would
lay
with
ear
drums
bursting
and
writhing
from
the
kicks
and
blows
that
had
been
freely
given
like
all
similar
mobs
this
one
carried
ropes
which
were
placed
about
the
necks
of
the
loggers
here
and
yelled
someone
what
shall
we
do
with
him
a
cry
was
given
to
lynch
him
some
were
taken
to
the
city
jail
and
the
rest
were
dumped
unceremoniously
on
the
other
side
of
the
county
line
since
that
time
the
wrecked
hall
has
remained
tenantless
and
unrepaired
grey
and
gaunt
like
a
house
in
belgium
it
stands
a
mute
testimony
of
the
ferocity
of
the
lumber
trust
repeated
efforts
have
since
been
made
to
destroy
the
remains
with
fire
the
defense
had
tried
without
avail
to
introduce
a
photograph
of
the
ruin
as
evidence
to
prove
that
the
second
hall
was
raided
in
a
similar
manner
on
armistice
day
judge
wilson
refused
to
permit
the
jury
to
see
either
the
photographs
or
the
hall
but
in
case
of
another
trial
evidently
the
lumber
trust
thought
it
better
to
have
all
traces
of
its
previous
crime
obliterated
the
raid
of
did
not
weaken
the
lumber
workers
union
in
centralia
on
the
contrary
it
served
to
strengthen
it
but
not
until
more
than
a
year
had
passed
were
the
loggers
able
to
establish
a
new
headquarters
this
hall
was
located
next
door
to
the
roderick
hotel
on
tower
avenue
between
second
and
third
streets
hardly
was
this
hall
opened
when
threats
were
circulated
by
the
chamber
of
commerce
that
it
like
the
previous
one
was
marked
for
destruction
the
business
element
was
lined
up
solid
in
denunciation
of
and
opposition
to
the
union
hall
and
all
that
it
stood
for
but
other
matters
took
up
their
attention
and
it
was
some
time
before
the
second
raid
was
actually
accomplished
there
was
one
rift
in
the
lute
of
lumber
trust
solidarity
in
centralia
business
and
professional
men
had
long
been
groveling
in
sycophantic
servility
at
the
feet
of
the
clique
there
was
only
one
notable
exception
a
lawyer
and
a
man
a
young
lawyer
had
settled
in
the
city
a
few
years
previous
to
the
armistice
day
tragedy
together
with
his
parents
and
four
brothers
he
had
left
his
home
in
minnesota
to
seek
fame
and
fortune
in
the
woods
of
washington
he
had
worked
his
way
through
mcalester
college
and
the
law
school
of
the
university
of
minnesota
he
was
young
ambitious
and
husky
a
loving
husband
and
the
proud
father
of
a
beautiful
baby
girl
nature
had
endowed
him
with
a
dangerous
combination
of
gifts
a
brilliant
mind
and
a
kind
heart
his
name
was
just
plain
smith
elmer
smith
and
he
came
from
the
old
rugged
american
stock
smith
started
to
practice
law
in
centralia
but
unlike
his
brother
attorneys
he
held
to
the
assumption
that
all
men
are
equal
under
the
law
even
the
hated
in
a
short
time
his
brilliant
mind
and
kind
heart
had
won
him
as
much
hatred
from
the
lumber
barons
as
love
from
the
which
is
saying
a
good
deal
the
interests
studied
the
young
lawyer
carefully
for
awhile
and
soon
decided
that
he
could
be
neither
bullied
or
bought
so
they
determined
to
either
break
his
spirit
or
to
break
his
neck
smith
is
at
present
in
prison
charged
with
murder
this
is
how
it
happened
smith
established
his
office
in
the
first
guarantee
bank
building
which
was
quite
the
proper
thing
to
do
then
he
began
to
handle
law
suits
for
which
was
altogether
the
reverse
caste
rules
in
centralia
and
elmer
smith
was
violating
its
most
sacred
mandataries
by
giving
the
working
trash
the
benefit
of
his
talents
instead
of
people
really
worth
while
warren
grimm
who
was
afterwards
shot
while
trying
to
break
into
the
union
hall
with
the
mob
once
cautioned
smith
of
the
folly
and
danger
of
such
a
course
you
get
along
all
right
said
he
if
you
will
come
in
with
us
then
he
continued
how
would
you
feel
if
one
of
your
clients
would
come
up
to
you
in
public
slap
you
on
the
back
and
say
elmer
very
proud
answered
the
young

receiving

which
is
in
defiance
of

one
of
the

brought
his
case
to

and
a
lawsuit
followed
this
was
an
proceeding
for
heretofore
such
little
business
tricks
had
been
kept
out
of
court
by
common
understanding
a
worker
formerly
employed
by
a
subsidiary
of
the
eastern
lumber
railway
company
had
been
deprived
of
his
wages
on
a
technicality
of

law
by
the
corporation
attorneys
this
man
had
a
large
family
and
hard
circumstances
were
forced
upon
them
by
this
misfortune
one
of
his
little
girls
died
from
what
the
doctor
called
malnutrition
plain
starvation
smith
filed
suit
and
openly
stated
that
the
lawyers
of
the
corporation
were
responsible
for
the
death
of
the
child
the
indignation
of
the
business
and
professional
element
blazed
to
white
heat
a
suit
for
libel
and
disbarment
proceedings
were
started
against
him
nothing
could
be
done
in
this
direction
as
smith
had
not
only
justice
but
the
law
on
his
side
his
enemies
were
waiting
with
great
impatience
for
a
more
favorable
opportunity
to
strike
him
down
open
threats
were
beginning
to
be
heard
against
him
a
union
lecturer
came
to
town
the
meeting
was
well
attended
a
vigilance
committee
of
provocateurs
and
business
men
was
in
the
audience
at
the
close
of
the
lecture
those
gentlemen
started
to
pass
the
signal
for
action
elmer
smith
sauntered
down
the
aisle
shook
hands
with
the
speaker
and
told
him
he
would
walk
to
the
train
with
him
the
following
morning
the
door
to
smith
office
was
ornamented
with
a
cardboard
sign
it
read
are
you
an
american
you
had
better
say
so
citizens
committee
this
was
lettered
in
lead
pencil
across
the
bottom
were
scrawled
these
words
no
more
meetings
for
you
in
an
event
occurred
which
served
further
to
tighten
the
noose
about
the
stubborn
neck
of
the
young
lawyer
on
this
occasion
the
terrorists
of
the
city
perpetrated
another
shameful
crime
against
the
working
class
and
the
law
blind
tom
a
blemish
on
america
tom
lassiter
made
his
living
by
selling
newspapers
at
a
little
stand
on
a
street
corner
tom
is
blind
a
good
soul
and
well
liked
by
the
loggers
but
tom
has
vision
enough
to
see
that
there
is
something
wrong
with
the
hideous
capitalist
system
we
live
under
and
so
he
kept
papers
on
sale
that
would
help
enlighten
the
workers
among
these
were
the
seattle
union
record
the
industrial
worker
and
solidarity
to
put
it
plainly
tom
was
a
thorn
in
the
side
of
the
local
respectability
because
of
his
modest
efforts
to
make
people
thing
and
his
doom
had
also
been
sealed
early
in
june
the
newsstand
was
broken
into
and
all
his
clothing
literature
and
little
personal
belongings
were
taken
to
a
vacant
lot
and
burned
a
warning
sign
was
left
on
a
short
pole
stuck
in
the
ashes
the
message
you
leave
town
in
hours
soldiers
sailors
and
marines
was
left
on
the
table
in
his
room
with
true
wobbly
determination
lassiter
secured
a
new
stock
of
papers
and
immediately
his
little
stand
about
this
time
a
centralia
business
man
roberts
by
name
was
heard
to
say
this
man
lassiter
is
within
his
legal
rights
and
if
we
ca
do
anything
by
law
we
take
the
law
into
our
own
hands
this
is
precisely
what
happened
on
the
afternoon
of
june
blind
tom
was
crossing
tower
avenue
with
hesitating
steps
when
without
warning
two
business
men
seized
his
groping
arms
and
yelled
in
his
ear
we
get
you
out
of
town
this
time
lassiter
called
for
help
the
good
samaritan
came
along
in
the
form
of
a
creature
known
as
patton
a
rich
property
owner
of
the
city
this
christian
gentleman
sneaked
up
behind
the
blind
man
and
lunged
him
forcibly
into
a
waiting
oakland
automobile
the
machine
is
owned
by
cornelius
mcintyre
who
is
said
to
have
been
one
of
the
kidnapping
party
shut
up
or
i
smash
your
mouth
so
you
ca
yell
said
one
of
his
assailants
as
lassiter
was
forced
still
screaming
for
help
into
the
car
turning
to
the
driver
one
of
the
party
said
step
on
her
and
let
get
out
of
here
about
this
time
constable
luther
patton
appeared
on
the
scene
patton
walked
over
to
where
the
constable
stood
and
shouted
to
the
bystanders
we
arrest
the
first
person
that
objects
interferes
or
gets
too
loud
a
good
smash
on
the
jaw
would
do
more
good
suggested
the
official
well
we
got
that
one
pretty
slick
and
now
there
are
two
more
we
have
to
get
stated
patton
a
short
time
afterwards
blind
tom
was
dropped
helpless
in
a
ditch
just
over
the
county
line
he
was
picked
up
by
a
passing
car
and
eventually
made
his
way
to
olympia
capital
of
the
state
in
about
a
week
he
was
back
in
centralia
but
before
he
could
again
resume
his
paper
selling
he
was
arrested
on
a
charge
of
criminal
syndicalism
he
is
now
awaiting
conviction
at
chehalis
before
his
arrest
however
lassiter
engaged
elmer
smith
as
his
attorney
smith
appealed
to
county
attorney
herman
allen
for
protection
for
his
client
after
a
effort
to
locate
the
kidnappers
who
were
known
to
everybody
this
official
gave
up
the
task
saying
he
was
too
busy
to
bother
with
the
affair
and
besides
the
offense
was
only
degree
assault
which
is
punishable
with
a
fine
of
but
one
dollar
and
costs
the
young
lawyer
did
not
waste
any
more
time
with
the
county
authorities
instead
he
secured
sworn
statements
of
the
facts
in
the
case
and
submitted
them
to
the
governor
these
were
duly
acknowledged
and
placed
on
file
in
olympia
but
up
to
date
no
action
has
been
taken
by
the
executive
to
prosecute
the
criminals
who
committed
the
crime
handle
these
cases
if
you
want
to
said
a
local
attorney
to
elmer
smith
counsel
for
one
of
the
banks
but
sooner
or
later
they
all
going
to
be
hanged
or
deported
anyway

where
barnett
rifle
was
supposed
to
have
been
found
eugene
barnett
was
said
to
have
left
his
rifle
under
this
as
he
fled
from
the
scene
of
the
shooting
it
would
have
been
much
easier
to
hide
a
gun
in
the
tall
brush
in
the
foreground
in
reality
barnett
did
not
have
a
rifle
on
november
and
was
never
within
a
mile
of
this
place
prosecutor
cunningham
said
he
had
been
looking
all
over
for
that
rifle
when
it
was
turned
over
to
him
by
a
stool
pigeon
strangely
enough
cunningham
knew
the
number
of
the
gun
before
he
placed
hands
on
it
smith
was
feathering
a
nest
for
himself
feathering
it
with
steel
and
stone
and
a
possible
coil
of
hempen
rope
the
shadow
of
the
prison
bars
was
falling
blacker
on
his
red
head
with
every
passing
moment
his
fearless
championing
of
the
cause
of
the
under
dog
had
won
him
the
implacable
hatred
of
his
own
class
to
them
his
acts
of
kindness
and
humanity
were
nothing
less
than
treason
smith
had
been
ungrateful
to
the
clique
that
had
offered
him
every
inducement
to
come
in
with
us
a
lawyer
with
a
heart
is
as
dangerous
as
a
working
man
with
his
brains
elmer
smith
would
be
punished
all
right
it
would
just
be
a
matter
of
time
the
indifference
of
the
county
and
state
authorities
regarding
the
kidnapping
of
blind
tom
gave
the
terrorists
renewed
confidence
in
the
efficacy
and
legality
of
their
methods
also
it
gave
them
a
hint
as
to
the
form
their
future
depredations
were
to
take
and
so
with
the
implied
approval
of
everyone
worth
considering
they
went
about
their
plotting
with
still
greater
determination
and
a
soothing
sense
of
security
the
conspiracy
develops
the
cessation
of
hostilities
in
europe
deprived
the
gangsters
of
the
cloak
of
patriotism
as
a
cover
for
their
crimes
but
this
cloak
was
too
convenient
to
be
discarded
so
easily
let
the
man
in
uniform
do
it
was
an
axiom
that
had
been
proved
both
profitable
and
safe
then
came
the
organization
of
the
local
post
of
the
american
legion
and
the
now
famous
citizen
protective
league
of
which
more
afterwards
with
the
signing
of
the
armistice
and
the
consequent
almost
imperceptible
lifting
of
the
white
terror
that
dominated
the
country
the
organization
of
the
loggers
began
daily
to
gather
strength
the
chamber
of
commerce
began
to
growl
menacingly
the
employers
association
to
threaten
and
the
lumber
trust
papers
to
incite
open
violence
and
the
american
legion
began
to
function
as
a
cats
paw
for
the
men
behind
the
scenes
why
should
the
beautiful
city
of
centralia
tolerate
the
hated
union
hall
any
longer
other
halls
had
been
raided
men
had
been
tarred
and
feathered
and
deported
no
one
had
ever
been
punished
why
should
the
good
citizens
of
centralia
endure
a
lumberworkers
headquarters
and
their
despised
union
itself
right
in
the
midst
of
their
peaceful
community
why
indeed
the
matter
appeared
simple
enough
from
any
angle
so
then
and
there
the
conspiracy
was
hatched
that
resulted
in
the
tragedy
on
armistice
day
but
the
forces
at
work
to
bring
about
this
unhappy
conclusion
were
far
from
local
let
us
see
what
these
were
like
before
the
actual
details
of
the
conspiracy
are
recounted
there
were
three
distinct
phases
of
this
campaign
to
rid
the
woods
of
the
agitators
these
three
phases
dovetail
together
perfectly
each
one
is
a
perfect
part
of
a
shrewdly
calculated
and
mercilessly
executed
conspiracy
to
commit
constructive
murder
and
unlawful
entry
the
diabolical
plan
itself
was
designed
to
brush
aside
the
laws
of
the
land
trample
the
constitution
underfoot
and
bring
about
an
unparalleled
orgy
of
unbridled
labor
hatred
and
labor
repression
that
would
settle
the
question
of
unionism
for
a
long
time
the
conspiracy
and
a
snag
first
of
all
comes
the
propaganda
stage
with
the
full
force
of
the
editorial
virulence
of
the
newspapers
directed
against
labor
in
favor
of
law
and
order
the
lumber
interests
all
the
machinery
of
newspaper
publicity
was
used
to
vilify
the
lumber
worker
and
to
discredit
his
union
nothing
was
left
unsaid
that
would
tend
to
produce
intolerance
and
hatred
or
to
incite
mob
violence
this
is
not
only
true
of
centralia
but
of
all
the
cities
and
towns
located
in
the
lumber
district
centralia
happened
to
be
the
place
where
the
tree
of
propaganda
first
bore
its
ghastly
fruit
space
does
not
permit
us
to
quote
the
countless
horrible
things
the
was
supposed
to
stand
for
and
to
be
constantly
planning
to
do
statements
from
the
lips
of
general
wood
and
young
roosevelt
to
the
effect
that
citizens
should
not
argue
with
bolshevists
but
meet
them
head
on
were
very
conspicuously
displayed
on
all
occasions
any
mediocrity
in
or
out
of
uniform
who
had
anything
particularly
atrocious
to
say
against
the
labor
movement
in
general
or
the
radicals
in
particular
was
afforded
every
opportunity
to
do
so
the
papers
were
vying
with
one
another
in
devising
effectual
if
somewhat
informal
means
of
dealing
with
the
red
menace
supported
by
and
partly
the
result
of
this
barrage
of
lies
misrepresentation
and
incitation
came
the
period
of
attempted
repression
by
law
this
was
probably
the
easiest
thing
of
all
because
the
grip
of
big
business
upon
the
and
machinery
of
the
nation
is
incredible
at
all
events
a
state
criminal
syndicalism
law
had
been
conveniently
passed
and
was
being
applied
vigorously
against
union
men
of
and
alike
but
chiefly
against
the
lumber
industrial
union
no
of
the
industrial
workers
of
the
world
the
basic
lumber
industry
being
the
largest
in
the
northwest
and
the
growing
power
of
the
organized
lumberjack
being
therefore
more
to
be
feared

was
martyrized
by

determination
to
let

do
it
no
doubt
the
lumber
interests
had
great
hope
that
the
execution
of
these
laws
would
clear
up
the
atmosphere
so
far
as
the
lumber
situation
was
concerned
but
they
were
doomed
to
a
cruel
and
surprising
disappointment
a
number
of
arrests
were
made
in
washington
oregon
idaho
montana
and
even
nevada
fifty
or
sixty
men
all
told
were
arrested
and
their
trials
rushed
as
test
cases
during
this
period
from
april
to
october
the
lumber
trust
saw
with
chagrin
and
dismay
each
of
the
state
cases
in
turn
either
won
outright
by
the
defendants
or
else
dismissed
in
the
realization
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
win
them

an
injunction
was
obtained
restraining
the
mayor
from
closing
down
the
new

hall
in
that
city
under
the

thus
it
appeared
that
the
nefarious
plan
of
the
employers
and
their
subservient
lawmaking
adjuncts
to
outlaw
the
lumber
workers
union
and
to
penalize
the

of

to

at
the
realization
of
their
own
impotency
the
interests
launched
forth
upon
a
new
campaign
this
truly
machiavellian
scheme
was
devised
to
make
it
impossible
for
accused
men
to
secure
legal
defense
of
any
kind
all
labor
cases
were
to
be
tried
simultaneously
thus
making
it
impossible
for
the
defendants
to
secure
adequate
counsel
george
russell
of

washington
employers
association
addressed
meetings
over
the
state
urging
all
washington
prosecuting
attorneys
to
organize
that
this
end
might
be
achieved
it
is
reported
that
governor
hart
of
washington
looked
upon
the
scheme
with
favor
when
it
was
brought
to
his
personal
attention
by
russell
however
the
fact
remains
that
the
lumber
trust
was
losing
and
that
it
would
have
to
devise
even
more
drastic
measures
if
it
were
to
hope
to
escape
the
prospect
of
a
very
humiliating
defeat
and
all
the
while
the
organization
of
the
lumber
workers
continued
to
grow
in
washington
the
situation
was
becoming
more
tense
momentarily
many
towns
in
the
heart
of
the
lumber
district
had
passed
absurd
criminal
syndicalism
ordinances
these
prohibited
membership
in
the
made
it
unlawful
to
rent
premises
to
the
organization
or
to
circulate
its
literature
the
employers
association
had
boasted
that
it
was
due
to
its
efforts
that
these
ordinances
had
been
passed
but
still
they
were
faced
with
the
provocative
and
unforgettable
fact
that
the
was
no
more
dead
than
the
cat
with
the
proverbial
nine
lives
where
halls
had
been
closed
or
raided
the
lumber
workers
were
transacting
their
union
affairs
right
on
the
job
or
in
the
bunkhouses
just
as
though
nothing
had
happened
what
was
more
deplorable
a
few
union
halls
were
still
open
and
doing
business
at
the
same
old
stand
centralia
was
one
of
these
drastic
measures
must
be
applied
at
once
or
loggers
in
other
localities
might
be
encouraged
to
open
halls
also
as
events
prove
these
measures
were
taken
and
they
were
drastic
the
employers
show
their
fangs
that
the
employers
association
was
assiduously
preparing
its
members
for
action
suitable
for
the
situation
is
evidenced
by
the
following

morsels

are
quoted
almost
at
random
from
the
private
bulletins
of
the
officials
of
the
iron
heel
in
the
state
of
washington
here
you
can
read
their
sentiments
in
their
own
words
you
can
see
how
dupes
and
hirelings
were
coached
to
perpetrate
the
crime
of
centralia
and
as
many
other
similar
crimes
as
they
could
get
away
with
needless
to
say
these
illuminating
lines
were
not
intended
for
the
perusal
of
the
working
class
but
now
that
we
have
obtained
them
and
placed
them
before
your
eyes
you
can
draw
your
own
conclusion
there
are
many
many
more
records
germane
to
this
case
that
we
would
like
to
place
before
you
but
the
oligarchy
has
closed
its
steel
jaws
upon
them
and
they
are
at
present
inaccessible
men
are
still
afraid
to
tell
the
truth
in
centralia
some
day
the
workers
may
learn
the
whole
truth
about
the
inside
workings
of
the
centralia
conspiracy
be
that
as
it
may
the
business
interests
of
the
northwest
lumber
country
stand
bloody
handed
and
doubly
damned
black
with
guilt
and
foul
with
crime
convicted
before
the
bar
of
public
opinion
by
their
own
statements
and
their
own
acts
failure
and
desperation
let
us
see
for
a
moment
how
the
conspiracy
of
the
lumber
barons
operated
to
achieve
the
unlawful
ends
for
which
it
was
designed
let
us
see
how
they
were
driven
by
their
own
failure
at
intrigue
to
adopt
methods
so
brutal
that
they
would
have
disgraced
the
how
they
tried
to
gain
with
what
they
had
failed
to
gain
lawfully
and
with
public
approval
the
campaign
of
lies
and
slander
inaugurated
by
their
private
newspapers
failed
to
convince
the
workers
of
the
undesirability
of
labor
organization
in
spite
of
the
armies
of
editors
and
assembled
to
its
aid
it
served
only
to
lash
to
a
murderous
frenzy
the
low
instincts
of
the
elements
in
the
community
the
campaign
of
legal
repression
admittedly
instituted
by
the
employers
association
failed
also
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
all
the
machinery
of
the
state
from
down
to
governor
was
at
its
beck
and
call
on
all
occasions
and
for
all
purposes
having
made
a
mess
of
things
with
these
methods
the
lumber
barons
threw
all
scruples
to
the
winds
if
they
ever
had
any
threw
aside
all
pretension
of
living
within
the
law
they
started
out
like
to
rent
wreck
and
destroy
the
last
vestige
of
labor
organization
from
the
woods
of
the
northwest
and
furthermore
to
hunt
down
union
men
and
martyrize
them
with
the
club
the
gun
the
rope
and
the
courthouse
it
was
to
cover
up
their
own
crimes
that
the
heartless
beasts
of
big
business
beat
the
of
the
press
in
order
to
lash
the
patriotism
of
their
dupes
and
hirelings
into
hysteria
it
was
to
hide
their
own
infamy
that
the
loathsome
war
dance
was
started
that
developed
perceptibly
from
uncomprehending
belligerency
into
the
lawless
tumult
of
mobs
raids
and
lynching
and
it
will
be
an
everlasting
blot
upon
the
fair
name
of
america
that
they
were
permitted
to
do
so
the
centralia
tragedy
was
the
culmination
of
a
long
series
of
unpunished
atrocities
against
labor
what
is
expected
of
men
who
have
been
treated
as
these
men
were
treated
and
who
were
denied
redress
or
protection
under
the
law
every
worker
in
the
northwest
knows
about
the
wrongs
lumberworkers
have
endured
they
are
matters
of
common
knowledge
it
was
common
knowledge
in
centralia
and
adjoining
towns
that
the
hall
was
to
be
raided
on
armistice
day
yet
eight
loggers
have
been
sentenced
from
to
forty
years
in
prison
for
the
crime
of
defending
themselves
from
the
mob
that
set
out
to
murder
them
but
let
us
see
how
the
conspiracy
was
operating
in
centralia
to
make
the
armistice
day
tragedy
inevitable
the
maelstrom
and
four
men
centralia
was
fast
becoming
the
vortex
of
the
conspiracy
that
was
rushing
to
its
inevitable
conclusion
event
followed
event
in
rapid
succession
straws
indicating
the
main
current
of
the
flood
tide
of
the
commercial
club
was
seething
with
intrigue
like
the
court
of
old
france
under
catherine
de
medici
only
this
time
it
was
industrial
unionism
instead
of
huguenots
who
were
being
marked
for
a
new
night
of
bartholomew
the
heresy
to
be
uprooted
was
belief
in
industrial
instead
of
religious
freedom
but
the
stake
and
the
gibbet
were
awaiting
the
new
idea
just
as
they
had
the
old
the
actions
of
the
lumber
interests
were
now
but
thinly
veiled
and
their
evil
purpose
all
too
manifest
the
connection
between
the
association
of
the
state
and
its
local
representatives
in
centralia
had
become
unmistakably
evident
and
behind
these
loomed
the
gigantic
silhouette
of
the
employers
association
of
the
nation
the
colossal
invisible
government
more
powerful
at
times
than
the
government
itself
more
and
more
stood
out
the
naked
brutal
fact
that
the
purpose
of
all
this
plotting
was
to
drive
the
union
loggers
from
the
city
and
to
destroy
their
hall
the
names
of
the
men
actively
interested
in
this
movement
came
to
light
in
spite
of
strenuous
efforts
to
keep
them
obscured
four
of
these

meeting
of

men
called

business
men
and

meet
the
officers

to
discuss
ways
and

of
bettering
the
conditions
which
now
confront
the
business

interests
of

george

says
in
his
note
to
business
men
need
your
advice
and
your
in
support
of
the
movement
for
the
defense
of
property
and
property
rights
it
is
the
most
important
question
before
the
public
today
at
this
meeting
russell
dwelt
on
the
statement
that
the
radicals
were
better
organized
than
the
property
interests
also
he
pointed
out
the
need
of
a
special
organization
to
protect
rights
of
property
from
the
encroachments
of
all
foes
of
the
government
the
league
the
triple
alliance
and
the
of
were
duly
condemned
the
speaker
then
launched
out
into
a
long
tirade
against
the
industrial
workers
of
the
world
which
was
characterized
as
the
most
dangerous
organization
in
america
and
the
one
most
necessary
for
good
citizens
to
crush
needless
to
state
the
address
was
chock
full
of
americanism
it
amply
made
up
in
forcefulness
anything
it
lacked
in
logic
so
the
citizens
protective
league
of
centralia
was
born
from
the
first
it
was
a
law
unto
itself

wearing
the

in

the
advent
of
this
infamous
league
marks
the
final
ascendancy
of
terrorism
over
the
constitution
in
the
city
of
centralia
the
only
things
still
needed
were
a
secret
committee
a
coil
of
rope
and
an
opportunity
hubbard
was
the
man
selected
to
pull
off
the
rough
stuff
and
at
the
same
time
keep
the
odium
of
crime
from
smirching
the
fair
names
of
the
conspirators
he
was
told
to
perfect
his
own
organization
hubbard
was
eminently
fitted
for
his
position
by
reason
of
his
intense
and
his
aptitude
for
intrigue

to
come
in
from
all
parts
of
the
county
to
have
a
peep
at

wrecked
business
men
were
known
to
drive
their
friends
from

old
hall
in

to
show
what
the
former
would
look
like

in

generally
knew
for
a
certainty
that
the

hall
would
go
the
way
of
its
predecessor
it

just
a

up
sentiment
against
the
union
loggers
and
their
hall
only
a
month
previously
on
labor
day
he
had
delivered
a
labor
speech
that
was
received
with
great
enthusiasm
by
a
local
clique
of
business
men
posing
as
an
authority
on
bolshevism
on
account
of
his
siberian
service
grimm
had
elaborated
on
the
dangers
of
this
pernicious
doctrine
with
a
great
deal
of
dramatic
emphasis
he
had
urged
his
audience
to
beware
of
the
sinister
influence
of
the
american
bolsheviki
the
industrial
workers
of
the
world
a
few
days
before
the
hall
was
raided
elmer
smith
called
at
grimm
office
on
legal
business
grimm
asked
him
by
the
way
what
he
thought
of
his
labor
day
speech
smith
replied
that
he
thought
it
was
rotten
and
that
he
could
agree
with
grimm
conception
of
americanism
smith
pointed
to
the
deportation
of
tom
lassiter
as
an
example
of
the
americanism
he
considered
disgraceful
he
said
also
that
he
thought
free
speech
was
one
of
the
fundamental
rights
of
all
citizens
i
ca
agree
with
you
replied
grimm
that
the
proper
way
to
treat
such
a
fellow
the
new
black
hundred
on
october
the
centralia
hub
published
an
item
headed
employers
called
to
discuss
handling
of
problem
this
article
urges
all
employers
to
attend
states
that
the
meeting
will
be
held
in
the
club
and
mentioned
the
wrecking
of
the
union
hall
in
on
the
following
day
october
three
weeks
before
the
shooting
this
meeting
was
held
at
the
hall
of
the
benevolent
and
protective
order
of
elks
the
now
famous
elks
club
of
centralia
the
avowed
purpose
of
this
meeting
was
to
deal
with
the
problem
the
chairman
was
william
scales
at
that
time
commander
of
the
centralia
post
of
the
american
legion
the
hall
was
the
chief
topic
of
discussion
hubbard
opened
up
by
saying
that
the
was
a
menace
and
should
be
driven
out
of
town
chief
of
police
hughes
however
cautioned
them
against
such
a
course
he
is
reported
to
have
said
that
the
is
doing
nothing
wrong
in
centralia
is
not
violating
any
law
and
you
have
no
right
to
drive
them
out
of
town
in
this
manner
the
chief
of
police
then
proceeded
to
tell
the
audience
that
he
had
taken
up
the
matter
of
legally
evicting
the
industrialists
with
city
attorney
grimm
a
brother
of
warren
grimm
who
is
said
to
have
told
them
gentlemen
there
is
no
law
by
which
you
can
drive
the
out
of
town
city
commissioner
saunders
and
county
attorney
allen
had
spoken
to
the
same
effect
the
latter
allen
had
gone
over
the
literature
of
the
organization
with
regard
to
violence
and
destruction
and
had
voluntarily
dismissed
a
criminal
syndicalist
case
without
trial
for
want
of
evidence

he
stood
at
the
corner
during
the
raid
and
received
papers
stolen
from
the
hall
there
is
no
record
of
his
having
protested
against
any
illegal
action
he
turned
over
his
office
to
the
special
prosecutors
and
acted
as
their
tool
throughout
during
the
entire
trial
he
never
appeared
as
an
active
participant
hubbard
was
furious
at
this
turn
of
affairs
and
shouted
to
chief
of
police
hughes
it
a
damned
outrage
that
these
men
should
be
permitted
to
remain
in
town
law
or
no
law
if
i
were
chief
of
police
they
stay
here
hours
i
not
in
favor
of
raiding
the
hall
myself
said
scales
but
certain
that
if
anybody
else
wants
to
raid
the
hall
there
is
no
jury
in
the
land
will
ever
convict
them
after
considerable
discussion
the
meeting
started
to
elect
a
committee
to
deal
with
the
situation
first
of
all
an
effort
was
made
to
get
a
workingman
elected
as
a
member
to
help
camouflage
its
very
evident
character
and
make
people
believe
that
honest
labor
was
also
desirous
of
ridding
the
town
of
the
hated
hall
a
switchman
named
henry
a
member
of
the
railway
brotherhood
was
nominated
when
he
indignantly
declined
hubbard
red
in
the
face
with
rage
called
him
a
damned
skunk
the
inner
circle
scales
then
proceeded
to
tell
the
audience
in
general
and
the
city
officials
in
particular
that
he
would
himself
appoint
a
committee
whose
inner
workings
were
secret
and
see
if
he
could
not
get
around
the
matter
that
way
the
officers
of
the
league
were
then
elected
the
president
was
county
coroner
david
livingstone
who
afterwards
helped
to
lynch
wesley
everest
livingstone
made
his
money
from
union
miners
william
scales
was
vice
president
and
hubbard
was
treasurer
the
secret
committee
was
then
appointed
by
hubbard
as
its
name
implies
it
was
an
underground
affair
similar
to
the
black
hundreds
of
old
russia
no
record
of
any
of
its
proceedings
has
ever
come
to
light
but
according
to
best
available
knowledge
warren
grimm
arthur
mcelfresh
cromier
and
one
or
two
others
who
figured
prominently
in
the
raid
were
members
at
all
events
on
november
five
days
before
the
shooting
grimm
was
elected
commander
of
the
centralia
post
of
the
american
legion
taking
the
place
of
scales
who
resigned
in
his
favor
scales
evidently
was
of
the
opinion
that
a
siberian
veteran
and
athlete
was
better
fitted
to
lead
the
shock
troops
than
a
mere
like
himself
there
is
no
doubt
but
the
secret
committee
had
its
members
well
placed
in
positions
of
strategic
importance
for
the
coming
event
the
following
day
the
tacoma
news
tribune
carried
a
significant
editorial
on
the
subject
of
the
new
organization
at
centralia
a
committee
of
citizens
has
been
formed
that
takes
the
mind
back
to
the
old
days
of
vigilance
committees
of
the
west
which
did
so
much
to
force
citizenship
upon
certain
lawless
elements
it
is
called
the
centralia
protective
association
and
its
object
is
to
combat
activities
in
that
city
and
the
surrounding
country
it
invites
to
membership
all
citizens
who
favor
the
enforcement
of
law
and
order
it
is
high
time
for
the
people
who
do
believe
in
the
lawful
and
orderly
conduct
of
affairs
to
take
the
upper
hand
every
city
and
town
might
with
profit
follow
centralia
example
the
reference
to
law
and
orderly
conduct
of
affairs
has
taken
a
somewhat
ironical
twist
now
that
centralia
has
shown
the
world
what
she
considers
such
processes
to
be
no
less
significant
was
an
editorial
appearing
on
the
same
date
in
the
centralia
hub
if
the
city
is
left
open
to
this
menace
we
will
soon
find
ourselves
at
the
mercy
of
an
organized
band
of
outlaws
bent
on
destruction
what
are
we
going
to
do
about
it
and
referring
to
the
organization
of
the
secret
committee
the
editorial
stated
it
was
decided
that
the
inner
workings
of
the
organization
were
to
be
kept
secret
to
more
effectively
combat
a
body
using
similar
tactics
the
editorial
reeks
with
lies
but
it
was
necessary
that
the
mob
spirit
should
be
kept
at
white
heat
at
all
times
newspaper
incitation
has
never
been
punished
by
law
yet
it
is
directly
responsible
for
more
murders
lynching
and
raids
than
any
other
one
force
in
america

the
plot
leaks
out
by
degrees
the
story
of
the
infamous
secret
committee
and
its
diabolical
plan
leaked
out
adding
positive
confirmation
to
the
many
already
credited
rumors
in
circulation
some
of
the
newspapers
quite
openly
hinted
that
the
hall
was
to
be
the
object
of
the
brewing
storm
chief
of
police
hughes
told
a
member
of
the
lewis
county
trades
council
william
merriman
by
name
that
the
business
men
were
organizing
to
raid
the
hall
and
drive
its
members
out
of
town
merriman
in
turn
carried
the
statement
to
many
of
his
friends
and
brother
unionists
soon
the
prospective
raid
was
the
subject
of
open
discussion
over
the
breakfast
toast
on
the
street
corners
in
the
camps
and
mills
every
place
so
common
was
the
knowledge
in
fact
that
many
of
the
craft
organizations
in
centralia
began
to
discuss
openly
what
they
should
do
about
it
they
realized
that
the
matter
was
one
which
concerned
labor
and
many
members
wanted
to
protest
and
were
urging
their
unions
to
try
to
do
something
at
the
lewis
county
trades
council
the
subject
was
brought
up
for
discussion
by
its
president
dickson
no
way
of
helping
the
loggers
was
found
however
if
they
would
so
stubbornly
try
to
keep
open
their
headquarters
in
the
face
of
such
opposition
harry
smith
a
brother
of
elmer
smith
the
attorney
was
a
delegate
at
this
meeting
and
reported
to
his
brother
the
discussion
that
took
place
secretary
britt
smith
and
the
loggers
at
the
union
hall
were
not
by
any
means
ignorant
of
the
conspiracy
being
hatched
against
them
day
by
day
they
had
followed
the
development
of
the
plot
with
breathless
interest
and
not
a
little
anxiety
they
knew
from
bitter
experience
how
union
men
were
handled
when
they
were
trapped
in
their
halls
but
they
would
not
entertain
the
idea
of
abandoning
their
principles
and
seeking
personal
safety
every
logging
camp
for
miles
around
knew
of
the
danger
also
the
loggers
there
had
gone
through
the
hell
of
the
organization
period
and
had
felt
the
wrath
of
the
lumber
barons
some
of
them
felt
that
the
statement
of
secretary
of
labor
wilson
as
to
the
attitude
of
the
industrial
workers
of
the
world
towards
overthrowing
the
government
and
violence
and
destruction
would
discourage
the
terrorists
from
attempting
such
a
flagrant
and
brutal
injustice
as
the
one
contemplated

oily
abel
suave
and
slimy
as

the
gamut
of
rottenness
in
his
efforts
to
convict
the
accused
men
without
the
semblance
of
a
fair
trial
abel
is
notorious
throughout
washington
as

the
brutality

which
it
treats

located
in

of

made
a

loggers
were
buoyed
up
with
the
many
victories
won
in
the
courts
on
criminal
syndicalism
charges
and
felt
that
the
raid
would
be
too
raw
a
thing
for
the
lumber
interests
even
to
consider
all
were
secure
in
the
knowledge
and
assurance
that
they
were
violating
no
law
in
keeping
open
their
hall
and
they
wanted
that
hall
kept
open
of
course
the
question
of
what
was
to
be
done
was
discussed
at
their
business
meetings
when
news
reached
them
on
november
of
the
contemplated
parade
they
decided
to
publish
a
leaflet
telling
the
citizens
of
centralia
about
the
justice
and
legality
of
their
position
the
aims
of
their
organization
and
the
real
reason
for
the
intense
hatred
which
the
lumber
trust
harbored
against
them
such
leaflet
was
drawn
up
by
secretary
britt
smith
and
approved
by
the
membership
it
was
an
honest
outspoken
appeal
for
public
sympathy
and
support
this
leaflet
word
for
word
as
it
was
printed
and
circulated
in
centralia
is
reprinted

to
the
citizens
of

we
must
appeal
illustration
the
chief
fink
frank
christensen
who
was
the
fixer
for
the
prosecution
as
assistant
attorney
general
he
used
his
office
to
intimidate
witnesses
and
in
the
effort
to
cover
up
actions
of
the
mob
he
is
reported
to
have
been
responsible
for
the
recovery
and
burial
of
everest

saying
got
to
bring
in
that
body
and
bury
it
if
the
wobs
ever
find
out
what
was
done
and
get
it
they
raise
hell
and
make
capital
of
it
to
the
law
abiding
citizens
of
centralia
and
to
the
working
class
in
general
we
beg
of
you
to
read
and
carefully
consider
the
following
the
profiteering
class
of
centralia
have
of
late
been
waving
the
flag
of
our
country
in
an
endeavor
to
incite
the
lawless
element
of
our
city
to
raid
our
hall
and
club
us
out
of
town
for
this
purpose
they
have
inspired
editorials
in
the
hub
falsely
and
viciously
attacking
the
hoping
to
gain
public
approval
for
such
revolting
criminality
these
profiteers
are
holding
numerous
secret
meetings
to
that
end
and
covertly
inviting
returned
service
men
to
do
their
bidding
in
this
work
they
are
ably
assisted
by
the
bankrupt
lumber
barons
of
southwest
washington
who
led
the
mob
that
looted
and
burned
the
hall
a
year
ago
these
criminal
thugs
call
us
a

of
outlaws
bent
on
destruction
this
they
do
in
an
attempt
to
hide
their
own
dastardly
work
in
burning
our
hall
and
destroying
our
property
they
say
we
are
a
menace
and
we
are
a
menace
to
all
mobocrats
and

or

falsely
and
with
out
any
foundation
whatever
charged
the
with
every
crime
on
the
statute
books
for
these
alleged
crimes
thousands
of
us
have
been
jailed
in
foul
and
filthy
cells
throughout
this
country
often
without
charge
for
months
and
in
some
cases
years
and
when
released
and
again
thrust
in
jail
to
await
a
trial
that
is
never
called
the
only
convictions
of
the
were
those
under
the
espionage
law
where
we
were
forced
to
trial
before
jurors
all
of
whom
were
at
political
and
industrial
enmity
toward
us
and
in
courts
hostile
to
the
working
class
this
same
class
of
handpicked
courts
and
juries
also
convicted
many
labor
leaders
socialists
pacifists
guilty
of
no
crime
save
that
of
loyalty
to
the
working

such
courts

the

anniversary
of

now
but
a
few
days
distant
and
centralia
felt
it
incumbent
upon
herself
to
celebrate
of
course
the
matter
was
brought
up
rather
circumspectly
but
knowing
smiles
greeted
the
suggestion
one
business
man
made
a
motion
that
the
brave
boys
wear
their
uniforms
this
was
agreed
upon
the
line
of
march
was
also
discussed
as
the
union
hall
was
a
little
off
the
customary
parade
route
scales
suggested
that
their
course
lead
past
the
hall
in
order
to
show
them
how
strong
we
are
it
was
intimated
that
a
command
eyes
right
would
be
given
as
the
legionaries
and
business
men
passed
the
union
headquarters
this
was
merely
a
poor
excuse
of
the
secret
committeemen
to
get
the
parade
where
they
needed
it
but
many
innocent
men
were
lured
into
a
lynching
bee
without
knowing
that
they
were
being
led
to
death
by
a
hidden
gang
of
conspirators
who
were
plotting
at
murder
lieutenant
cormier
who
afterwards
blew
the
whistle
that
was
the
signal
for
the
raid
endorsed
the
proposal
of
scales
as
did
grimm
and
mcelfresh
all
three
of
them
secret
committeemen
practically
no
other
subject
but
the
parade
was
discussed
at
this
meeting
the
success
of
the
project
was
now
assured
for
it
had
placed
into
the
hands
of
the
men
who
alone
could
arrange
to
have
the
men
in
uniform
do
it
the
men
in
uniform
had
done
it
once
before
and
people
knew
what
to
expect
the
day
following
this
meeting
the
centralia
hub
published
an
announcement
of
the
coming
event
stating
that
the
legionaires
had
voted
to
wear
uniforms
the
line
of
march
was
published
for
the
first
time
any
doubts
about
the
real
purpose
of
the
parade
vanished
when
people
read
that
the
precession
was
to
march
from
the
city
park
to
third
street
and
tower
avenue
and
return
the
union
hall
was
on
tower
between
second
and
third
streets
practically
at
the
end
of
the
line
of
march

from

from
this

wesley
everest
was
left
dangling
by
a
mob
of
business
men
automobile
parties
visited
this
spot
at
different
times
during
the
night
and
played
their
headlights
on
the
corpse
in
order
better
to
enjoy
the
spectacle
decent
labor
hands
off
a
short
time
after
the
shooting
a
virulent
leaflet
was
issued
by
the
mayor
office
stating
that
the
plot
to
kill
had
been
laid
two
or
three
weeks
before
the
tragedy
and
that
the
attack
of
the
loggers
was
without
justification
or
excuse
both
statements
are
bare
faced
lies
the
meeting
was
held
the
and
the
line
of
march
made
public
of
the
the
loggers
could
not
possibly
have
planned
a
week
and
a
half
previously
to
shoot
into
a
parade
they
knew
nothing
about
and
whose
line
of
march
had
not
yet
been
disclosed
it
was
proved
in
court
that
the
union
men
armed
themselves
at
the
very
last
moment
after
everything
else
had
failed
and
they
had
been
left
helpless
to
face
the
alternative
of
being
driven
out
of
town
or
being
lynched
about
this
time
eyewitnesses
declare
coils
of
rope
were
being
purchased
in
a
local
hardware
store
this
rope
is
all
cut
up
into
little
pieces
now
and
most
of
it
is
dirty
and
stained
but
many
of
centralia
best
families
prize
their
souvenir
highly
they
say
it
brings
good
luck
to
a
family
a
few
days
after
the
meeting
just
described
william
dunning
vice
president
of
the
lewis
county
trades
and
labor
assembly
met
warren
grimm
on
the
street
having
fresh
in
his
mind
a
recent
talk
about
the
raid
in
the
labor
council
meetings
and
being
well
aware
of
grimm
standing
and
influence
dunning
broached
the
subject
we
been
discussing
the
threatened
raid
on
the
hall
he
said
who
are
you
an
asked
grimm
dunning
replied
stating
that
he
was
vice
president
of
the
labor
assembly
and
proceeded
to
tell
grimm
the
feeling
of
his
organization
on
the
subject
decent
labor
ought
to
keep
its
hands
off
was
grimm
laconic
reply
the
sunday
before
the
raid
a
public
meeting
was
held
in
the
union
hall
about
a
hundred
and
fifty
persons
were
in
the
audience
mostly
working
men
and
women
of
centralia
a
number
of
loggers
were
present
dressed
in
the
invariable
mackinaw
stagged
overalls
and
caulked
shoes
john

a
muscular
and
young
man
with
a
rough
honest
face
and
a

hazel
eyes

was
always
twinkling

was
shortly
to
be
mutilated
and
lynched
by
the
mob
i
hope
to
jesus
nothing
happens
the
atmosphere
of
the
meeting
was
already
tainted
with
the
terror
nerves
were
on
edge
every
time
any
newcomer
would
enter
the
door
the
audience
would
look
over
their
shoulders
with
apprehensive
glances
at
the
conclusion
of
the
meeting
the
loggers
gathered
around
the
secretary
and
asked
him
the
latest
news
about
the
contemplated
raid
for
reply
britt
smith
handed
them
copies
of
the
leaflet
we
must
appeal
and
told
of
the
efforts
that
had
been
made
and
were
being
made
to
secure
legal
protection
and
to
let
the
public
know
the
real
facts
in
the
case
if
they
raid
the
hall
again
as
they
did
in
the
boys

stand
for
it
said

logger
if
the
law
wo
protect
us
we
got
a
right
to
protect
ourselves
ventured
another
i
hope
to
jesus
nothing
happens
replied
the
secretary
wesley
everest
laid
down
his
few
unsold
papers
rolled
a
brown
paper
cigarette
and
smiled
enigmatically
over
the
empty
seats
in
the
general
direction
of
the
new
one
big
union
label
on
the
front
window
his
closest
friends
say
he
was
never
afraid
of
anything
in
all
his
life
none
of
these
men
knew
that
loggers
from
nearby
camps
having
heard
of
the
purchase
of
the
coils
of
rope
were
watching
the
hall
night
and
day
to
see
that
nothing
happens
the
next
day
after
talking
things
over
with
britt
smith
mcallister
wife
of
the
proprietor
of
the
roderick
hotel
from
whom
the
loggers
rented
the
hall
went
to
see
chief
of
police
hughes
this
is
how
she
told
of
the
interview
i
got
worried
and
i
went
to
the
chief
i
says
to
him
you
going
to
protect
my
property
hughes
says
do
the
best
we
can
for
you
but
as
far
as
the
wobblies
are
concerned
they
would
last
fifteen
minutes
if
the
business
men
start
after
them
the
business
men
do
want
any
wobblies
in
this
town
the
day
before
the
tragedy
elmer
smith
dropped
in
at
the
union
hall
to
warn
his
clients
that
nothing
could
now
stop
the
raid
defend
it
if
you
choose
to
do
so
he
told
them
the
law
gives
you
that
right
it
was
on
the
strength
of
this
remark
overheard
by
the
morgan
and
afterwards
reported
to
the
prosecution
that
elmer
smith
was
hailed
to
prison
charged
with
murder
in
the
first
degree
his
enemies
had
been
certain
all
along
that
his
incomprehensible
delusion
about
the
law
being
the
same
for
the
poor
man
as
the
rich
would
bring
its
own
punishment
it
did
there
can
no
longer
be
any
doubt
on
the
subject

it

that
equaled

november
was
a
raw
gray
day
the
cold
sunlight
barely
penetrating
the
mist
that
hung
over

the
distant
hills
the
parade
assembled
at
the
city
park
lieutenant
cormier
was

was
commander
of
the

division
in
a
very
short
time
he
had
the
various
bodies
arranged
to
his
satisfaction
at
the
head
of
the
procession
was
the
centralia
bunch
this
was
followed
by
one
from
chehalis
the
county
seat
and
where
the
parade
would
logically
have
been
held
had
its
purpose
been
an
honest
one
then
came
a
few
sailors
and
marines
and
a
large
body
of
well
dressed
gentlemen
from
the
elks
the
school
children
who
were
to
have
marched
did
not
appear
at
the
very
end
were
a
couple
of
dozen
boy
scouts
and
an
automobile
carrying
pretty
girls
dressed
in
red
cross
uniforms
evidently
this
parade
unlike
the
one
of
did
not
like
a
scorpion
carry
its
sting
in
the
rear
but
wait
until
you
read
how
cleverly
this
part
of
it
had
been
arranged
the
marchers
were
unduly
silent
and
those
who
knew
nothing
of
the
lawless
plan
of
the
secret
committee
felt
somehow
that
something
must
be
wrong
city
postmaster
mccleary
and
a
old
man
named
thompson
were
seen
carrying
coils
of
rope
thompson
is
a
veteran
of
the
civil
war
and
a
minister
of
god
on
the
witness
stand
he
afterwards
swore
he
picked
up
the
rope
from
the
street
and
was
carrying
it
as
a
joke
it
turned
out
that
the
joke
was
on
wesley
everest
be
ready
for
the
command
right
or
left
when
we
pass
the
stand
grimm
told
the
platoon
commanders
just
as
the
parade
started
the
procession
covered
most
of
the
line
of
march
without
incident
when
the
union
hall
was
reached
there
was
some
craning
of
necks
but
no
outburst
of
any
kind
a
few
of
the
paraders
looked
at
the
place
curiously
and
several
business
men
were
seen
pointing
the
hall
out
to
their
friends
there
were
some
dark
glances
and
a
few
long
noses
but
no
demonstration
when
do
we
reach
the
reviewing
stand
asked
a
parader
named
joe
smith
of
a
man
marching
beside
him

there
ai

the
reply
we
going
to
give
the

right
on
the
way
back
the
head
of
the
columns
reached
third
avenue
and
halted
a
command
of
face
was
given
and
the
procession
again
started
to
march
past
the
union
hall
going
in
the
opposite
direction
the
loggers
inside
felt
greatly
relieved
as
they
saw
the
crowd
once
more
headed
for
the
city
but
the
centralia
and
chehalis
contingents
that
had
headed
the
parade
was
now
in
the
rear
just
where
the
scorpion
sting
of
the
parade
had
been
located
the
danger
was
not
yet
over
let
go
at
boys
the
chehalis
division
had
marched
past
the
hall
and
the
centralia
division
was
just
in
front
of
it
when
a
sharp
command
was
given
the
latter
stopped
squarely
in
front
of
the
hall
but
the
former
continued
to
march
lieutenant
cormier
of
the
secret
committee
was
riding
between
the
two
contingents
on
a
bay
horse
suddenly
he
placed
his
fingers
to
his
mouth
and
gave
a
shrill
whistle
immediately
there
was
a
hoarse
cry
of
at
boys
about
sixty
feet
separated
the
two
contingents
at
this
time
the
chehalis
men
still
continuing
the
march
cromier
spurred
his
horse
and
overtook
them
are
you
boys
in
on
this
he
shouted
at
the
words
let
go
the
paraders
from
both
ends
and
the
middle
of
the
centralia
contingent
broke
ranks
and
started
on
the
run
for
the
union
headquarters
a
crowd
of
soldiers
surged
against
the
door
there
was
a
crashing
of
glass
and
a
splintering
of
wood
as
the
door
gave
way
a
few
of
the
marauders
had
actually
forced
their
way
into
the
hall
then
there
was
a
shot
three
more
shots
and
a
small
volley
from
seminary
hill
and
the
avalon
hotel
rifles
began
to
crack
illustration
elks
club
centralia
it
was
here
that
the
centralia
conspiracy
was
hatched
and
the
notorious
secret
committee
appointed
to
do
the
dirty
work
the
mob
stopped
suddenly
astounded
at
the
unexpected
opposition
out
of
hundreds
of
halls
that
had
been
raided
during
the
past
two
years
this
was
the
first
time
the
union
men
had
attempted
to
defend
themselves
it
had
evidently
been
planned
to
stampede
the
entire
contingent
into
the
attack
by
having
the
secret
committeemen
take
the
lead
from
both
ends
and
the
middle
but
before
this
could
happen
the
crowd
frightened
at
the
shots
started
to
scurry
for
cover
two
men
were
seen
carrying
the
limp
figure
of
a
soldier
from
the
door
of
the
hall
when
the
volley
started
they
dropped
it
and
ran
the
soldier
was
a
handsome
young
man
named
arthur
mcelfresh
he
was
left
lying
in
front
of
the
hall
with
his
feet
on
the
curb
and
his
head
in
the
gutter
the
whole
thing
had
been
a
matter
of
seconds
i
had
no
business
being
there
several
men
had
been
wounded
a
pool
of
blood
was
widening
in
front
of
the
doorway
a
big
man
in
officer
uniform
was
seen
to
stagger
away
bent
almost
double
and
holding
his
hands
over
his
abdomen
my
god
i
shot
he
had
cried
to
the
soldier
beside
him
this
was
warren
grimm
the
other
was
his
friend
frank
van
gilder
grimm
walked
unassisted
to
the
rear
of
a
nearby
soft
drink
place
from
whence
he
was
taken
to
a
hospital
he
died
a
short
time
afterwards
van
gilder
swore
on
the
witness
stand
that
grimm
and
himself
were
standing
at
the
head
of
the
columns
of
unoffending
paraders
when
his
friend
was
shot
he
stated
that
grimm
had
been
his
friend
but
admitted
that
when
his
friend
received
his
mortal
wound
that
he
van
gilder
instead
of
acting
like
a
hero
in
no
man
land
had
deserted
him
in
precipitate
haste
too
many
eye
witnesses
had
seen
grimm
stagger
wounded
from
the
doorway
of
the
hall
to
suit
the
prosecution
van
gilder
knew
at
which
place
grimm
had
been
shot
but
it
was
necessary
that
he
be
placed
at
a
convenient
distance
from
the
hall
it
is
reported
on
good
authority
that
grimm
just
before
he
died
in
the
hospital
confessed
to
a
person
at
his
bedside
it
served
me
right
i
had
no
business
being
there
a
workingman
john
patterson
had
come
down
town
on
armistice
day
with
his
three
small
children
to
watch
the
parade
he
was
standing
feet
from
the
door
of
the
hall
when
the
raid
started
on
the
witness
stand
patterson
told
of
being
pushed
out
of
the
way
by
the
rush
before
the
shooting
began
he
saw
a
couple
of
soldiers
shot
and
saw
grimm
stagger
away
from
the
doorway
wounded
in
the
abdomen
the
testimony
of
bickford
at
the
corner
inquest
under
oath
was
as
follows
i
spoke
up
and
said
i
would
lead
if
enough
would
follow
but
before
i
could
take
the
lead
there
were
many
ahead
of
me
someone
next
to
me
put
his
foot
against
the
door
and
forced
it
open
after
which
a
shower
of
bullets
poured
through
the
opening
about
us
bickford
is
an
man
and
one
of
the
very
few
legionaires
who
dared
to
tell
the
truth
about
the
shooting
the
centralia
business
element
has
since
tried
repeatedly
to
ruin
him
in
trying
to
present
the
plea
of
self
defense
to
the
court
defense
attorney
vanderveer
stated
there
was
a
rush
men
reached
the
hall
under
the
command
of
grimm
and
yet
counsel
asks
to
have
shown
a
specific
overt
act
of
grimm
before
we
can
present
the
plea
of
would
he
have
had
the
men
wait
with
their
lives
at
stake
the
fact
is
that
grimm
was
there
and
in
defending
themselves
these
men
shot
grimm
was
killed
because
he
was
there
they
could
not
wait
your
honor
self
defense
is
much
good
after
a
man
is
dead
the
prosecution
sought
to
make
a
point
of
the
fact
that
the
loggers
had
fired
into
a
street
in
which
there
were
innocent
bystanders
as
well
as
paraders
but
the
fact
remains
that
the
only
men
hit
by
bullets
were
those
who
were
in
the
forefront
of
the
mob
through
the
hall
window
how
the
raid
looked
from
the
inside
of
the
hall
can
best
be
described
from
the
viewpoint
of
one
of
the
occupants
bert
faulkner
a
union
logger
and
man
faulkner
described
how
he
had
dropped
in
at
the
hall
on
armistice
day
and
stood
watching
the
parade
from
the
window
in
words
all
the
more
startling
for
their
sheer
artlessness
he
told
of
the
events
which
followed
first
the
grimacing
faces
of
the
business
men
then
as
the
soldiers
returned
a
muffled
order
the
smashing
of
the
window
with
the
splinters
of
glass
falling
against
the
curtain
the
crashing
open
of
the
door
and
the
shots
that
made
his
ears
ring
and
made
him
run
for
shelter
to
the
rear
of
the
hall
with
the
shoulder
of
his
overcoat
torn
with
a
bullet
then
how
he
found
himself
on
the
back
stairs
covered
with
rifles
and
commanded
to
come
down
with
his
hands
in
the
air
finally
how
he
was
frisked
to
the
city
jail
in
an
automobile
with
a
business
man
standing
over
him
armed
with
a
piece
of
gas
pipe
eugene
barnett
gave
a
graphic
description
of
the
raid
as
he
saw
it
from
the
office
of
the
adjoining
roderick
hotel
barnett
said
he
saw
the
line
go
past
the
hotel
the
business
men
were
ahead
of
the
soldiers
and
as
this
detachment
passed
the
hotel
returning
the
soldiers
still
were
going
north
the
business
men
were
looking
at
the
hall
and
pointing
it
out
to
the
soldiers
some
of
them
had
their
thumbs
to
their
noses
and
others
were
saying
various
things

city

centralia
at
this
place
the
parade
assembled
that
started
out
to
raid
the
union
hall
and
lynch
its
secretary
when
the
soldiers
turned
and
came
past
i
saw
a
man
on
horseback
ride
past
he
was
giving
orders
which
were
repeated
along
the
line
by
another
as
the
rider
passed
the
hotel
he
gave
a
command
and
the
second
man
said
up
men
when
this
order
came
the
men
all
rushed
for
the
hall
i
heard
glass
break
i
heard
a
door
slam
there
was
another
sound
and
then
shooting
came
it
started
from
inside
the
hall
as
i
saw
these
soldiers
rush
the
hall
i
jumped
up
and
threw
off
my
coat
i
thought
there
would
be
a
fight
and
i
was
going
to
mix
in
then
came
the
shooting
and
i
knew
i
had
no
business
there
later
barnett
went
home
and
remained
there
until
his
arrest
the
next
day
in
the
union
hall
besides
bert
faulkner
were
wesley
everest
roy
becker
britt
smith
mike
sheehan
james
mcinerney
and
the
stool

these
with
the
exception
of
faulkner
and
everest
remained
in
the
hall
until
the
authorities
came
to
place
them
under
arrest
they
had
after
the
first
furious
rush
of
their
assailants
taken
refuge
in
a
big
and
long
disused
ice
box
in
the
rear
of
the
hall
britt
smith
was
unarmed
his
revolver
being
found
afterwards
fully
loaded
in
his
desk
after
their
arrest
the
loggers
were
taken
to
the
city
jail
which
was
to
be
the
scene
of
an
inquisition
unparalleled
in
the
history
of
the
united
states
after
this
as
an
additional
punishment
they
were
compelled
to
face
the
farce
of
a
fair
trial
in
a
capitalistic
court
wesley
everest
but
destiny
had
decided
to
spare
one
man
the
bitter
irony
of
judicial
murder
wesley
everest
still
had
a
pocket
full
of
cartridges
and
a
automatic
that
could
speak
for
itself
this
had
done
most
of
the
shooting
in
the
hall
he
held
off
the
mob
until
the
very
last
moment
and
instead
of
seeking
refuge
in
the
refrigerator
after
the
paraders
had
been
dispersed
he
ran
out
of
the
back
door
reloading
his
pistol
as
he
went
it
is
believed
by
many
that
arthur
mcelfresh
was
killed
inside
the
hall
by
a
bullet
fired
by
everest
in
the
yard
at
the
rear
of
the
hall
the
mob
had
already
reorganized
for
an
attack
from
that
direction
before
anyone
knew
what
had
happened
everest
had
broken
through
their
ranks
and
scaled
the
fence
do
follow
me
and
i
wo
shoot
he
called
to
the
crowd
and
displaying
the
still
smoking
blue
steel
pistol
in
his
hand
there
goes
the
secretary
yelled
someone
as
the
logger
started
at
top
speed
down
the
alley
the
mob
surged
in
pursuit
collapsing
the
board
fence
before
them
with
sheer
force
of
numbers
there
was
a
rope
in
the
crowd
and
the
union
secretary
was
the
man
they
wanted
the
chase
that
followed
probably
saved
the
life
not
only
of
britt
smith
but
the
remaining
loggers
in
the
hall
as
well
running
down
the
alley
the
mob
gave
a
shout
of
exaltation
as
everest
slowed
his
pace
and
turned
to
face
them
they
stopped
cold
however
as
a
number
of
quick
shots
rang
out
and
bullets
whistled
and
zipped
around
them
everest
turned
in
his
tracks
and
was
off
again
like
a
flash
reloading
his
pistol
as
he
ran
the
mob
again
resumed
the
pursuit
the
logger
ran
through
an
open
gateway
paused
to
turn
and
again
fire
at
his
pursuers
then
he
ran
between
two
frame
dwellings
to
the
open
street
when
the
mob
again
caught
the
trail
they
were
evidently
under
the
impression
that
the
logger
ammunition
was
exhausted
at
all
events
they
took
up
the
chase
with
redoubled
energy
some
men
in
the
mob
had
rifles
and
now
and
then
a
would
be
taken
at
the
fleeing
figure
the
marksmanship
of
both
sides
seems
to
have
been
poor
for
no
one
appears
to
have
been
injured

this
kind
of
running
fight
was
kept
up
until
everest
reached
the
river
having
kept
off
his
pursuers
thus
far
the
boy
started
boldly
for
the
comparative
security
of
the
opposite
shore
splashing
the
water
violently
as
he
waded
out
into
the
stream
the
mob
was
getting
closer
all
the
time
suddenly
everest
seemed
to
change
his
mind
and
began
to
retrace
his
steps
to
the
shore

he
stood
dripping
wet
in
the
tangled
grasses
to
await
the
arrival
of

on

destruction

had
lost
his
hat
and
his
wet
hair
stuck
to
his
forehead

gun
was
now
so
hot
he
could
hardly
hold
it
and
the
last
of
his
ammunition
was
in
the
magazine

witnesses
declare
his
face
still
wore
a
quizzical
half
bantering
smile
when
the
mob
overtook
him
with
the
pistol
held
loosely
in
his
rough
hand
everest
stood
at
bay
ready
to
make
a
last
stand
for
his
life
seeing
him
thus
and
no
doubt
thinking
his
last
bullet
had
been
expended
the
mob
made
a
rush
for
its
quarry

shouted

fought

through

took
the

from

looking
into

cried
indignantly

lay
in
a
wet
heap
twitching
with
agony
a
tiny
bright
stream
of
blood
gathered
at
his
side
and
trailed
slowly
along
the
floor
only
an
occasional
quivering
moan
escaped
his
torn
lips
as
the
hours
slowly
passed
by
here
is
your

later
at
night
when
it
was
quite
dark
the
lights
of
the
jail
were
suddenly
snapped
off
at
the
same
instant
the
entire
city
was
plunged
in
darkness
a
clamour
of
voices
was
heard
beyond
the
walls
there
was
a
hoarse
shout
as
the
panel
of
the
outer
door
was
smashed
in
do
shoot

said
the
policemen
on
guard
here
is

it
was
night
now
and
the

men
had
no
further
reason
for
not
lynching

their
approaching
foot
steps
in
the
dark
he
arose
drunkenly
to
meet
them
tell
the
boys
i
died
for

he
whispered
brokenly
to
the
union
men
in
the
cells
these
were
the
last
words
he
uttered
in
the
jail
there
were
sounds
of
a
short
struggle
and
of
many
blows
then
a
door
slammed
and
in
a
short
time
the
lights
were
switched
on
the
darkened
city
was
again
illuminated
at
the
same
moment
outside
three
luxurious
automobiles
were
purring
them
selves
out
of
sight
in
the
darkness
the
only
man
who
had
protested
the
lynching
at
the
last
moment
was
william

do
kill
him

he
is
said
to
have
begged
of

it
was

late
if
you
do
go
through
with
this
you
an
too
they
told
him
scales
could
not
calm
the
evil
passions
he
had
helped
to
arouse
but
how
did
it
happen
that
the
lights
were
turned
out
at
such
an
opportune
time
could
it
be
that
city
officials
were
working

in

with

mob

attorney

offered
to
prove

such
was

case
he
offered
to
prove
this
was
a
part
of
the
greater
conspiracy
against
the
union
loggers
and
their
hall
offered
to
prove
it
point
by
point
from
the
very
beginning
incidentally
vanderveer
offered
to
prove
that
earl
craft
electrician
in
charge
of
the
city
lighting
plant
had
left
the
station
at
seven
on
armistice
day
after
securely
locking

door
and
that
while
craft
was
away
the
lights
of
the
city
were
turned
off
and
wesley
everest
taken
out
and
lynched
furthermore
he
offered
to
prove
that
when
craft
returned
the
lights
were
again
turned
on
and
the
city
electrician
his
assistant
and
the
mayor
of
centralia
were
in
the
building
with
the
door
again
locked
these
offers
were
received
by
his
honor
with
impassive
judicial
dignity
but
the
faces
of
the
lumber
trust
attorneys
were
wreathed
with
smiles
at
the
audacity
of
the
suggestion
the
corporation
lawyers
very
politely
registered
their
objections
which
the
judge
as
politely
sustained
the
night
of
horrors
after
everest
had
been
taken
away
the
jail
became
a
nightmare
as
full
of
horrors
as
a
madman
dream
the
mob
howled
around
the
walls
until
late
in
the
night
inside
a
lumber
trust
lawyer
and
his
official
assistants
were
administering
the
third
degree
to
the
arrested
loggers
to
make
them
confess
one
at
a
time
the
men
were
taken
to
the
torture
chamber

so
terrible
was
the
ordeal
of
this
american
inquisition

broken

in
things
any

is
always
looking
around
with

talking
of
voices
and
wires
that
no
one
but
himself
knows
anything
about
there
is
no
telling
what
they
did
to
the
boy
but
he
signed
the
confession
its
most
incriminating
statement
must
have
contained
too
much
truth
for
the
prosecution
it
was
never
used
in
court
when
interviewed
by
frank
walklin
of

loggers
told
the
story
in
their
own
way

tales
of
cruelty
said
james

but
i
believe
what
we
boys
went
through
on
those
nights
can
never
be
equaled

thought
it
was
my
last
night
on
earth
and
had
reconciled
myself
to
an
early
death
of
some
kind
perhaps
hanging
i
was
taken
out
once
by
the
mob
and
a
rope
was
placed
around
my
neck

thrown
over
a

something
i
waited
for
them
to
pull
the
rope
but
they
did
i
heard
voices
in
the
mob
say
not
him
and
then
i
was
put

i
felt
sure
was
coming
ray
becker
listening
at
britt
side
said
yes
that
was
one
hell
of
a
night
and
the
strain
of
that
night
seems
to
linger
in
their
faces
probably
it
always
will
remain
the
expression
of
a
memory
that
can
never
be
blotted
out
when
asked
if
they
felt
safer
when
the
soldiers
arrived
to
guard
the
centralia
jail
there
was
a
long
pause
and
finally
the
answer
was
yes
but
you
must
remember
offered
one
that
they
took
out
at
tulsa
from
a
supposedly
guarded
jail
and
we
could
know
from
where
we
were
what
was
going
on
outside
for
ten
days
we
had
no
blankets
said
mike
sheehan
it
was
cold
weather
and
we
had
to
sleep
uncovered
on
concrete
floors
in
those
ten
days
i
had
no
more
than
three
hours
sleep
the
mob
and
those
who
came
after
the
mob
would
let
us
sleep
they
would
come
outside
our
windows
and
hurl
curses
at
us
and
tell
each
of
us
it
would
be
our
turn
next
they
brought
in
wesley
everest
and
laid
him
on
the
corridor
floor
he
was
bleeding
from
his
ears
and
mouth
and
nose
was
curled
in
a
heap
and
groaning
and
men
outside
and
inside
kept
up
the
din
i
tried
to
sleep
i
was
nearly
mad
my
temples
kept
pounding
like
i
do
know
how
a
man
can
go
through
all
that
and
live
but
we
did
all
through
the
night
the
prisoners
could
hear
the
voices
of
the
mob
under
their
cell
windows
well
we
fixed
that
guy
everest
all
right
some
one
would
say
now
we
get
roberts
then
the
lights
would
snap
off
there
would
be
a
shuffling
curses
a
groan
and
the
clanking
of
a
steel
door
all
the
while
they
were
being
urged
to
come
clean
with
a
statement
that
would
clear
the
lumber
trust
of
the
crime
and
throw
the
blame
onto
its
victims

with
the
young

who
had
been
taken
out
into
the
night
things
were
different
wesley
everest
was
thrown
half
unconscious
into
the
bottom
of
an
automobile
the
hands
of
the
men
who
had
dragged
him
there
were
sticky
and
red
their
pant
legs
were
sodden
from
rubbing
against
the
crumpled
figure
at
their
feet
through
the
dark
streets
sped
the
three
machines
the
smooth
asphalt
became
a
rough
road
as
the
suburbs
were
reached
then
came
a
stretch
of
open
country
with
the
chehalis
river
bridge
only
a
short
distance
ahead
the
cars
lurched
over
the
uneven
road
with
increasing
speed
their
headlights
playing
on
each
other
or
on
the
darkened
highway
wesley
everest
stirred
uneasily
raising
himself
slowly
on
one
elbow
he
swung
weakly
with
his
free
arm
striking
one
of
his
tormentors
full
in
the
face
the
other
occupants
immediately
seized
him
and
bound
his
hands
and
feet
with
rope
it
must
have
been
the
glancing
blow
from
the
fist
of
the
logger
that
gave
one
of
the
gentlemen
his
fiendish
inspiration
reaching
in
his
pocket
he
produced
a
razor
for
a
moment
he
fumbled
over
the
now
limp
figure
in
the
bottom
of
the
car
his
companions
looked
on
with
stolid
acquiescence
suddenly
there
was
a
piercing
scream
of
pain
the
figure
gave
a
convulsive
shudder
of
agony
after
a
moment
wesley
everest
said
in
a
weak
voice
for
christ
sake
men
shoot
me
do
let
me
suffer
like
this
on
the
way
back
to
centralia
after
the
parade
rope
had
done
its
deadly
work
the
gentlemen
of
the
razor
alighted
from
the
car
in
front
of
a
certain
little
building
he
asked
leave
to
wash
his
hands
they
were
as
red
as
a
butcher
great
clots
of
blood
were
adhering
to
his
sleeves
that
about
the
nastiest
job
i
ever
had
to
do
was
his
casual
remark
as
he
washed
himself
in
the
cool
clear
water
of
the
washington
hills
the
name
of
this
man
is
known
to
nearly
everybody
in
centralia
he
is
still
at
large
the
headlight
of
the
foremost
car
was
now
playing
on
the
slender
steel
framework
of
the
chehalis
river
bridge
this
machine
crossed
over
and
stopped
the
second
one
reached
the
middle
of
the
bridge
and
stopped
while
the
third
came
to
a
halt
when
it
had
barely
touched
the
plankwork
on
the
near
side
the
occupants
of
the
first
and
last
cars
alighted
and
proceeded
at
once
to
patrol
both
approaches
to
the
bridge
lynching
an
american
institution
wesley
everest
was
dragged
out
of
the
middle
machine
a
rope
was
attached
to
a
girder
with
the
other
end
tied
in
a
noose
around
his
neck
his
almost
lifeless
body
was
hauled
to
the
side
of
the
bridge
the
headlights
of
two
of
the
machines
threw
a
white
light
over
the
horrible
scene
just
as
the
lynchers
let
go
of
their
victim
the
fingers
of
the
half
dead
logger
clung
convulsively
to
the
planking
of
the
bridge
a
business
man
stamped
on
them
with
a
curse
until
the
grip
was
broken
there
was
a
swishing
sound
then
a
sudden
crunching
jerk
and
the
rope
tied
to
the
girder
began
to
writhe
and
twist
like
a
live
thing
this
lasted
but
a
short
time
the
lynchers
peered
over
the
railing
into
the
darkness
then
they
slowly
pulled
up
the
dead
body
attached
a
longer
rope
and
repeated
the
performance
this
did
not
seem
to
suit
them
either
so
they
again
dragged
the
corpse
through
the
railings
and
tied
a
still
longer
rope
around
the
horribly
broken
neck
of
the
dead
logger
the
business
men
were
evidently
enjoying
their
work
and
besides
the
more
rope
the
more
souvenirs
for
their
friends
who
would
prize
them
highly
this
time
the
knot
was
tied
by
a
young
sailor
he
knew
how
to
tie
a
good
knot
and
was
proud
of
the
fact
he
boasted
of
the
stunt
afterwards
to
a
man
he
thought
as
beastly
as
himself
in
all
probability
he
never
dreamed
he
was
talking
for
publication
but
he
was
the
rope
had
now
been
lengthened
to
about
fifteen
feet
the
broken
and
gory
body
was
kicked
through
the
railing
for
the
last
time
the
knot
on
the
girder
did
not
move
any
more
then
the
lynchers
returned
to
their
luxurious
cars
and
procured
their
rifles
a
headlight
flashed
the
dangling
figure
into
ghastly
relief
it
was
riddled
with
volley
after
volley
the
man
who
fired
the
first
shot
boasted
of
the
deed
afterwards
to
a
brother
lodge
member
he
did
know
he
was
talking
for
publication
either
on
the
following
morning
the
corpse
was
cut
down
by
an
unknown
hand
it
drifted
away
with
the
current
a
few
hours
later
frank
christianson
a
tool
of
the
lumber
trust
from
the
attorney
general
office
arrived
in
centralia
we
got
to
get
that
body
this
worthy
official
declared
or
the
wobs
will
find
it
and
raise
hell
over
its
condition
the
corpse
was
located
after
a
search
it
was
not
buried
however
but
carted
back
to
the
city
jail
there
to
be
used
as
a
terrible
object
lesson
for
the
benefit
of
the
incarcerated
union
men
the
unrecognizable
form
was
placed
in
a
cell
between
two
of
the
loggers
who
had
loved
the
lynched
boy
as
a
comrade
and
a
friend
something
must
be
done
to
make
the
union
men
admit
that
they
and
not
the
lumber
interests
had
conspired
to
commit
murder
this
was
the
final
act
of
ruthlessness
it
was
fruitful
in
results
one
confession
one
judas
and
one
shattered
mind
were
the
result
of
their
last
deed
of
fiendish
terrorism
illustration
the
burial
of
the
mob
victim
no
undertaker
would
handle
everest
body
the
autopsy
was
performed
by
a
man
from
portland
who
hung
the
body
up
by
the
heels
and
played
a
hose
on
it
the
men
lowering
the
plank
casket
into
the
grave
are
union
loggers
who
had
been
caught
in
the
police
drag
net
and
taken
from
jail
for
this
purpose
no
undertaker
could
be
found
to
bury
everest
body
so
after
two
days
it
was
dropped
into
a
hole
in
the
ground
by
four
union
loggers
who
had
been
arrested
on
suspicion
and
were
released
from
jail
for
this
purpose
the
burial
is
supposed
to
have
taken
place
in
the
new
cemetery
the
body
being
carried
thither
in
an
auto
truck
the
union
loggers
who
really
dug
the
grave
declare
however
that
the
interment
took
place
at
a
desolate
spot
somewhere
along
a
railroad
track
another
body
was
seen
covered
with
ashes
in
a
cart
being
taken
away
for
burial
on
the
morning
of
the
twelfth
there
are
persistent
rumors
that
more
than
one
man
was
lynched
on
the
eve
of

a
guard
of
heavily
armed
soldiers
had
charge

no
one
seems
to
know
why
or
when
as
comical
as
a

an
informal
inquest
was
held
in

a
man
from

that

he
hung
the

up

it
was
here
that
bickford
let
slip
the
statement
about

being
raided
before

started
this
was
the
first
inkling

to
reach

the
inquest
to
a
meeting
of
gentlemen
at
the

club
in
explaining
the
death
of
the
union
logger
livingstone
stated
that
wesley
everest
had
broken
out
of
jail
gone
to
the
chehalis
river
bridge
and
jumped
off
with
a
rope
around
his
neck
finding
the
rope
too
short
he
climbed
back
and
fastened
on
a
longer
one
jumped
off
again
broke
his
neck
and
then
shot
himself
full
of
holes
livingstone
audience
appreciative
of
his
tact
and
levity
laughed
long
and
hearty
business
men
still
chuckle
over
the
joke
in

as
funny
as
a
funeral
is
no
longer
the
stock
saying
in
this
humorous
little
town
as
comical
as
a
coroner
is
now
the
approved
form
the
acting
on
the
theory
that
a
strong
offensive
is
the
best
defense
the
terrorists
took
immediate
steps
to
conceal
all
traces
of
their
crime
and
to
shift
the
blame
onto
the
shoulders
of
their
victims
the
capitalist
press
did
yeoman
service
in
this
cause
by
deluging
the
nation
with
a
veritable
avalanche
of
lies
for
days
the
district
around
centralia
and
the
city
itself
were
at
the
mercy
of
a
mob
the
homes
of
all
workers
suspected
of
being
sympathetic
to
labor
were
spied
upon
or
surrounded
and
entered
without
warrant
doors
were
battered
down
at
times
and
women
and
children
abused
and
insulted
heavily
armed
posses
were
sent
out
in
all
directions
in
search
of
reds
all
roads
were
patrolled
by
armed
business
men
in
automobiles
a
strict
mail
and
wire
censorship
was
established
it
was
the
open
season
for
wobblies
and
intimidation
was
the
order
of
the
day
the
white
terror
was
supreme
an
associated
press
reporter
was
compelled
to
leave
town
hastily
without
bag
or
baggage
because
he
inadvertently
published
indiscreet
remark
about
the
starting
of
the
trouble
men
and
women
did
not
dare
to
think
much
less
think
aloud
some
of
them
in
the
district
are
still
that
way
to
eugene
barnett
little
home
came
a
posse
armed
to
the
teeth
they
asked
for
barnett
and
were
told
by
his
young
wife
that
he
had
gone
up
the
hill
with
his
rifle
placing
a
bayonet
to
her
breast
they
demanded
entrance
the
brave
little
woman
refused
to
admit
them
until
they
had
shown
a
warrant

surrendered
when
he
had
made

he
was

being
made
for

in

by

that

was
lynched

night
of

at

and
a
little
atmosphere
the
trial
was
held
on
the
third
floor
of
the
building
as
you
look
at
the
picture
the
soldiers
were
sent
for
over
the
head
of
the
judge
by
one
of
the
lumber
trust
attorneys
of
the
prosecution
their
only
purpose
was
to
create
the
proper
atmosphere
for
an
unjust
conviction
hypocrisy
and
terror
the
reign
of
terror
was
extended
to
cover
the
entire
west
coast
over
a
thousand
men
and
women
were
arrested
in
the
state
of
washington
alone
union
halls
were
closed
and
kept
that
way
labor
papers
were
suppressed
and
many
men
have
been
given
sentences
of
from
one
to
fourteen
years
for
having
in
their
possession
copies
of
periodicals
which
contained
little
else
but
the
truth
about
the
centralia
tragedy
the
seattle
union
record
was
temporarily
closed
down
and
its
stock
confiscated
for
daring
to
hint
that
there
were
two
sides
to
the
story
during
all
this
time
the
capitalist
press
was
given
full
rein
to
spread
its
infamous
poison
the
general
public
denied
the
true
version
of
the
affair
was
shuddering
over
its
morning
coffee
at
the
thought
of
desperadoes
shooting
down
unoffending
paraders
from
ambush
but
the
lumber
interests
were
chortling
with
glee
and
winking
a
suggestive
eye
at
their
high
priced
lawyers
who
were
making
ready
for
the
prosecution
jurymen
were
shortly
to
be
drawn
and
things
were
sitting
pretty
as
they
say
in
poker
adding
a
characteristic
touch
to
the
rotten
hypocrisy
of
the
situation
came
a
letter
from

court

mcintosh
to

was
in

you
my
appreciation
of
the
high
character
of
citizenship
displayed
by
the
people
of
centralia
in
their
agonizing
calamity
we
are
all
shocked
by
the
manifestation
of
barbarity
on
the
part
of
the
outlaws
and
are
depressed
by
the
loss
of
lives
of
brave
men
but
at
the
same
time
are
proud
of
the
calm
control
and
loyalty
to
american
ideals
demonstrated
by
the
returned

i
am
proud
to
be

attorney
general
thompson
after
a
secret
conference
of
prosecuting
attorneys
issued
a
circular
of
advice
to
county
prosecutors
in
this
document
the
suggestion
was
made
that
officers
and
members
of
the
industrial
workers
of
the
world
in
washington
be
arrested
by
the
wholesale
under
the
criminal

law
and
brought
to
trial
simultaneously
so
that
they
might
not
be
able
to
secure
legal
defense
the
astounding
recommendation
was
also
made
that
owing
to
the
fact
that
juries
had
been
reluctant
to
convict
prosecutors
and

bar
association
should
in
examining
jury
panels
so
that
none
but
courageous
and
patriotic
americans
secure
places
on
the
juries
this
effectual
if
somewhat
arbitrary
plan
was
put
into
operation
at
once
since
the
tragedy
at
centralia
dozens
of
union
workers
have
been
convicted
by
courageous
and
patriotic
juries
and
sentenced
to
serve
from
one
to
fourteen
years
in
the
state
penitentiary
hundreds
more
are
awaiting
trial
the
verdict
at
montesano
is
now
known
to
everyone
truly
the
lives
of
the
four
legion
boys
which
were
sacrificed
by
the
lumber
interests
in
furtherance
of
their
own
murderous
designs
were
well
expended
the
investment
was
a
profitable
one
and
the
results
are
no
doubt
highly
gratifying
but
just
the
same
the
despicable
plot
of
the
attorney
general
is
an
obvious
effort
to
defeat
the
purpose
of
the
courts
and
obtain
unjust
convictions
by
means
of
what
is
termed
jury
fixing
there
may
be
honor
among
thieves
but
there
is
plainly
none
among
the
public
servants
they
have
working
for
them

mike
sheenan
born
in
ireland
years
old
has
been
a
union
man
for
over
fifty
years
having
joined
his
grandfather
union
when
he
was
only
eight
has
been
through
many
strikes
and
has
been
repeatedly
beaten
and
even
exiled
he
was
a
stoker
in
the

during
the

mike
sheehan
was
arrested
in
the
union
hall
went
through
the
horrible
experience
in
the
city
jail
and
was
found
not
guilty
by
the
jury
like
elmer
smith
he
was
on
another
similar
charge
and
thrown
back
in
jail
the
only
sane
note
sounded
during
these
dark
days
outside
of
the
startling
statement
of
bickford
came
from
montana
edward
bassett
commander
of
the
butte
post
of
the
american
legion
and
an
veteran
issued
a
statement
to
the
labor
press
that
was
truly
remarkable
the
in
centralia
who
fired
upon
the
men
that
were
attempting
to
raid
the
headquarters
were
fully
justified
in
their
act
mob
rule
in
this
country
must
be
stopped
and
when
mobs
attack
the
home
of
a
millionaire
of
a
laborer
or
of
the
it
is
not
only
the
right
but
the
duty
of
the
occupants
to
resist
with
every
means
in
their
power
if
the
officers
of
the
law
can
not
stop
these
raids
perhaps
the
resistance
of
the
raided
may
have
that
effect
whether
the
is
a
meritorious
organization
or
not
whether
it
is
unpopular
or
otherwise
should
have
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
the
case
the
reports
of
the
evidence
at
the
coroner
jury
show
that
the
attack
was
made
before
the
firing
started
if
that
is
true
i
commend
the
boys
inside
for
the
action
that
they
took
the
fact
that
there
were
some
american
legion
men
among
the
paraders
who
everlastingly
disgraced
themselves
by
taking
part
in
the
raid
does
not
affect
my
judgment
in
the
least
any
one
who
becomes
a
party
to
a
mob
bent
upon
unlawful
violence
can
not
expect
the
truly
patriotic
men
of
the
american
legion
to
condone
his
act
vanderveer

defense
attorney
george
vanderveer
hurried
across
the
continent
from
chicago
to
take
up
the
legal
battle
for
the
eleven
men
who
had
been
arrested
and
charged
with
the
murder
of
warren
grimm
the
lumber
interests
had
already
selected
six
of
their
most
trustworthy
tools
as
prosecutors
it
is
not
the
purpose
of
the
present
writer
to
give
a
detailed
story
of
this
trial
possibly
one
of
the
greatest
travesties
on
justice
ever
staged
this
incident
was
a
very
important
part
of
the
centralia
conspiracy
but
a
hasty
sketch
such
as
might
be
portrayed
in
these
pages
would
be
an
inadequate
presentation
at
best
it
might
be
well
therefore
to
permit
vanderveer
to
tell
of
the
case
as
he
told
it
to
the
jury
in
his
opening
and
closing
arguments
details
of
the
trial
itself
can
be

capable

vanderveer
opening
address
appears
in
part
below
may
it
please
the
court
and
gentlemen
of
the
jury
as
you
have
already
sensed
from
our
examination
of
you
and
from
a
question
which
i
propounded
to
counsel
at
the
close
of
his
statement
yesterday
the
big
question
in
this
case
is
who
was
the
aggressor
who
started
the
battle
was
it
on
the
one
side
a
deliberately
planned
murderous
attack
upon
innocent
marchers
or
was
it
on
the
other
side
a
deliberately
planned
wicked
attack
upon
the
which
they
merely
resisted
that
i
say
is
the
issue
i
asked
counsel
what
his
position
would
be
in
order
that
you
might
know
it
and
that
he
said
was
his
position
that
he
would
stand
and
fall
and
be
judged
by
it
and
i
say
to
you
now
that
is
our
position
and
we
will
stand
or
fall
and
be
judged
by
that
issue
in
order
that
you
may
properly
understand
this
situation
and
the
things
that
led
up
to
it
the
motives
underlying
it
the
manner
in
which
it
was
planned
and
executed
i
want
to
go
just
a
little
way
back
of
the
occurrence
on
november
and
state
to
you
in
rough
outline
the
situation
that
existed
in
centralia
the
objects
that
were
involved
in
this
case
the
things
each
are
trying
to
accomplish
and
the
way
each
went
about
it
there
has
been
some
effort
on
the
part
of
the
state
to
make
it
appear
it
is
not
an
trial
i
felt
throughout
that
the
issue
must
come
into
this
case
and
now
that
they
have
made
their
opening
statement
i
say
unreservedly
it
is
here
in
this
case
not
because
we
want
to
drag
it
in
here
but
because
it
ca
be
left
out
to
conceal
from
you
gentlemen
that
it
is
an
issue
would
be
merely
to
conceal
the
truth
from
you
and
we
on
our
part
do
want
to
do
that
now
or
at
any
time
hereafter
the
is
at
the
bottom
of
this
not
as
an
aggressor
however
it
is
a
labor
organization
organized
in
chicago
in
and
it
is
because
of
the
philosophy
for
which
it
stands
and
because
of
certain
tactics
which
it
evolves
that
this
thing
arose
illustration
james
mcinerney
logger
born
in
county
claire
ireland
joined
the
industrial
workers
of
the
world
in
was
wounded
on
the
steamer
verona
when
the
lumber
trust
tried
to
exterminate
the
union
lumberworkers
with
bullets
at
everett
washington
mcinerney
was
one
of
those
trapped
in
the
hall
he
surrendered
to
officers
of
the
law
while
in
the
city
jail
his
neck
was
worn
raw
with
a
hangman
rope
in
an
effort
to
make
him
confess
that
the
loggers
and
not
the
mob
had
started
the
trouble
mcinerney
told
them
to
go
to
hell
he
is
irish
and
an
and
proud
of
being
both
a
labor
movement
on
trial
the
is
the
representative
in
this
country
of
the
labor
movement
of
the
rest
of
the
world
it
is
the
representative
in
the
united
states
of
the
idea
that
capitalism
is
wrong
that
no
man
has
a
right
moral
or
otherwise
to
exploit
his
fellow
men
the
idea
that
our
industrial
efforts
should
be
conducted
not
for
the
profits
of
any
individual
but
should
be
conducted
for
social
service
for
social
welfare
so
the
says
first
that
the
wage
system
is
wrong
and
that
it
means
to
abolish
that
wage
system
it
says
that
it
intends
to
do
this
not
by
political
action
not
by
balloting
but
by
organization
on
the
industrial
or
economical
field
precisely
as
employers
precisely
as
capital
is
organized
on
the
basis
of
the
industry
not
on
the
basis
of
the
tool
the
says
industrial
evolution
has
progressed
to
that
point
there
the
tool
no
longer
enforces
craftsmanship
in
the
place
of
a
half
dozen
or
dozen
who
were
employed
each
a
skilled
artisan
employed
to
do
the
work
you
have
a
machine
process
to
do
that
work
and
it
resulted
in
the
organization
of
the
industry
on
an
industrial
basis
you
have
the
oil
industry
controlled
by
the
standard
oil
you
have
the
lumber
industry
controlled
by
the
lumbermen
association
of
the
south
and
west
and
you
have
the
steel
and
copper
industry
all
organized
on
an
industrial
basis
resulting
in
a
fusing
or
corporation
or
trust
of
a
lot
of
former
owners
now
the
say
if
they
are
to
compete
with
our
employers
we
must
compete
with
our
employers
as
an
organization
and
as
they
are
organized
so
we
must
protect
our
organization
as
they
protect
themselves
and
so
they
propose
to
organize
into
industrial
unions
the
steel
workers
and
the
coal
miners
and
the
transportation
workers
each
into
its
own
industrial
unit
this
plan
of
organization
is
extremely
distasteful
to
the
employers
because
it
is
efficient
because
it
means
a
new
order
a
new
system
in
the
labor
world
in
this
country
the
meaning
of
this
can
be
gathered
in
some
measure
from
the
recent
experiences
in
the
steel
strike
of
this
country
where
they
acted
as
an
industrial
unit
from
the
recent
experiences
in
the
coal
mining
industry
where
they
acted
as
an
industrial
unit
instead
of
having
two
or
three
dozen
other
crafts
each
working
separately
they
acted
as
an
industrial
unit
when
the
strike
occurred
it
paralyzed
industry
and
forced
concessions
to
the
demands
of
the
workers
that
is
the
first
thing
the
stands
for
and
in
some
measure
and
in
part
explains
the
attitude
capital
has
taken
all
over
the
country
towards
it
in
the
next
place
it
says
that
labor
should
organize
on
the
basis
of
some
fundamental
principle
and
labor
should
organize
for
something
more
than
a
mere
bartering
and
dickering
for
fifty
cents
a
day
or
for
some
shorter
time
something
of
that
sort
it
says
that
the
system
is
fundamentally
wrong
and
must
be
fundamentally
changed
before
you
can
look
for
some
improvement
its
philosophy
is
based
upon
government
statistics
which
show
that
in
a
few
years
in
this
country
our
important
industries
have
crept
into
more
than
of
our
entire
wealth
per
cent
of
the
workers
in
the
basic
industry
are
unable
to
send
their
children
to
school
per
cent
of
the
heads
of
the
families
in
our
basic
industries
are
unable
to
provide
a
decent
living
for
their
families
without
the
assistance
of
the
other
members
per
cent
of
our
laborers
are
able
to
live
up
to
the
myth
that
he
is
the
head
of
the
family
the
results
of
these
evils
are
manifold
our
people
are
not
being
raised
in
decent
vicinities
they
are
not
being
raised
and
educated
their
health
is
not
being
cared
for
their
morals
are
not
being
cared
for
i
will
show
you
that
in
certain
of
our
industries
where
the
wages
are
low
and
the
hours
are
long
that
the
children
of
the
working
people
die
at
the
rate
of
to
per
thousand
inhabitants
under
the
age
of
one
year
because
of
their
undernourishment
lack
of
proper
housing
and
lack
of
proper
medical
attention
and
because
the
mothers
of
these
children
before
they
are
born
and
when
the
children
are
being
carried
in
the
mother
womb
that
they
are
compelled
to
go
into
the
industries
and
work
and
work
and
work
and
before
the
child
can
receive
proper
nourishment
the
mother
is
compelled
to
go
back
into
the
industry
and
work
again
the
say
there
must
be
a
fundamental
change
and
that
fundamental
change
must
be
in
the
line
of
reorganization
of
industry
for
public
service
so
that
the
purpose
shall
be
that
we
will
work
to
live
and
not
merely
live
to
work
work
for
service
rather
than
work
for
profit
illustration
james
mcinerney
after
he
had
undergone
the
third
degree
mcinerney
had
a
rope
around
his
neck
nearly
all
night
before
this
picture
was
taken
one
end
of
the
rope
had
been
pulled
taut
over
a
beam
by
his
tormentors
mcinerney
had
told
them
to
go
to
hell
it
no
use
trying
to
get
anything
out
of
a
man
like
that
was
the
final
decision
of
the
inquisitors
to
kill
an
ideal
some
time
in
september
counsel
told
you
the
holding
these
beliefs
opened
a
hall
in
centralia
back
of
that
hall
was
a
living
room
where
britt
smith
lived
kept
his
clothes
and
belongings
and
made
his
home
from
then
on
the
conducted
a
regular
propaganda
meeting
every
saturday
night
these
propaganda
meetings
were
given
over
to
a
discussion
of
these
industrial
problems
and
beliefs
from
that
district
there
were
dispatched
into
nearby
lumber
camps
and
wherever
there
were
working
people
to
whom
to
carry
this
message
there
were
dispatched
organizers
who
went
out
made
the
talks
in
the
camps
briefly
and
sought
to
organize
them
into
this
union
at
least
to
teach
them
the
philosophy
of
this
labor
movement
because
that
propaganda
is
fatal
to
those
who
live
by
other
people
work
who
live
by
the
profits
they
wring
from
labor
it
excited
intense
opposition
on
the
part
of
employers
and
business
people
of
centralia
and
about
the
time
this
hall
was
opened
we
will
show
you
that
people
from
seattle
where
they
maintain
their
headquarters
for
these
labor
fights
came
into
centralia
and
held
meetings
i
do
know
what
they
call
this
new
thing
they
were
seeking
to
organize
it
is
in
fact
a
branch
of
the
merchants
and
manufacturers
association
of
the
united
states
a
national
organization
whose
sole
purpose
is
to
fight
and
crush
and
beat
labor
it
was
in
no
sense
a
local
movement
because
it
started
in
seattle
and
it
was
organized
by
people
from
seattle
and
the
purpose
was
to
organize
in
centralia
an
organization
of
business
men
to
combat
this
new
labor
philosophy
whether
in
the
mouths
of
the
or
nonpartisan
league
or
the
socialists
it
did
not
make
any
difference
to
brand
anybody
as
a
traitor
who
sought
to
tell
the
truth
about
our
industrial
conditions

was
a

that
hall
was
wrecked
just
as
was
this
hall
these
profiteering
gentlemen
never
overlook
an
opportunity
to
capitalize
on
a
patriotic
event
and
so
they
capitalized
the
red
cross
parade
that
day
just
as
they
capitalized
the
armistice
day
parade
on
november
and
in
exactly
the
same
way
as
on
november
and
that
day
when
the
of
the
parade
of
the
red
cross
passed
the
main
avenue
it
broke
off
and
went
a
block
out
of
its
way
and
attacked
the
hall
a
good
building
and
they
broke
it
into
splinters
the
furniture
records
the
literature
that
belongs

anybody
nor
to
shoot
anybody
in
any
parade
i
want
you
to
ask
yourself
why
would
anybody
want
to
shoot
anybody
in
a
parade
and
to
particularly
ask
yourself
why
anyone
would
want
to
shoot
upon
soldiers
he
who
was
a
soldier
himself
wesley
everest
the
man
who
did
most
of
the
shooting
and
the
man
whom
they
beat
until
he
was
unconscious
and
whom
they
grabbed
from
the
street
and
put
a
rope
around
his
neck
the
man
whom
they
nearly
shot
to
pieces
and
the
man
whom
they
hung
once
dropping
him
ten
feet
and
when
what
did
kill
him
lengthened
the
rope
to
feet
and
dropped
him
again
why
would
one
soldier
want
to
kill
another
soldier
or
soldiers
who
had
never
done
him
nor
his
fellows
any
harm
i
exonerate
the
american
legion
as
an
organization
of
the
responsibility
of
this
for
i
say
they
did
know
about
it
the
day
will
come
when
they
will
realize
that
they
have
been
mere
catspaws
in
the
hands
of
the
centralia
commercial
interests
that
is
the
story
i
do
know
what
the
verdict
will
be
today
but
the
verdict
ten
years
hence
will
be
the
verdict
in
the
lovejoy
case
that
these
men
were
within
their
rights
and
that
they
fought
for
a
cause
that
these
men
fought
for
liberty
they
fought
for
these
things
for
which
we
stand
and
for
which
all
true
lovers
of
liberty
stand
and
those
who
smashed
them
up
are
the
real
enemies
of
our
country
this
is
a
big
case
counsel
says
the
biggest
case
that
has
ever
been
tried
in
this
country
but
the
biggest
thing
about
these
big
things
is
from
beginning
to
end
it
has
been
a
struggle
on
the
one
side
for
ideals
and
on
the
other
side
to
suppress
those
ideals
this
thing
was
started
with
hubbard
at
its
head
it
is
being
started
today
with
hubbard
at
its
head
in
this
courtroom
and
i
do
believe
you
will
fall
for
it
vanderveer
closing
argument
there
are
only
two
real
issues
in
this
case
one
is
the
question
who
was
the
aggressor
in
the
armistice
day
affray
the
other
is
was
eugene
barnett
in
the
avalon
hotel
window
when
that
affray
occurred
we
have
proven
by
unimpeachable
witnesses
that
there
was
a
raid
on
the
hall
in
centralia
on
november
a
raid
in
which
the
business
interests
of
the
city
used
members
of
the
american
legion
as
catspaws
we
have
shown
that
warren
grimm
for
the
killing
of
whom
these
defendants
are
on
trial
actually
took
park
in
that
raid
and
was
in
the
very
doorway
of
the
hall
when
the
attack
was
made
despite
the
attempts
of
the
prosecution
to
place
grimm
feet
away
when
he
was
shot
we
have
proven
a
complete
alibi
for
eugene
barnett
through
unshaken
and
undisputable
witnesses
he
was
not
in
the
avalon
hotel
during
the
riot
he
was
in
the
roderick
hotel
lobby
he
had
no
gun
and
he
took
no
part
in
the
shooting
in
my
opening
statement
i
said
i
would
stand
or
fall
on
the
issue
of
who
was
the
aggressor
on
armistice
day
i
have
stood
by
that
promise
and
stand
by
it
now
abel
specially
hired
prosecutor
in
this
trial
made
the
same
promise
so
did
herman
allen
the
official
lewis
county
prosecutor
who
has
been
so
ingloriously
shoved
aside
by
abel
and
his
colleague
cunningham
ever
since
the
beginning
here
but
a
few
days
ago
when
the
defense
was
piling
up
evidence
showing
that
there
was
a
raid
on
the
hall
by
the
paraders
abel
backed
down
why
were
the
shots
fired
i
was
careful
in
the
beginning
to
put
him
on
record
on
that
point
all
along
i
knew
that
he
and
allen
would
back
down
on
the
issue
of
who
was
the
aggressor
they
could
not
uphold
their
contention
that
the
armistice
day
paraders
were
fired
upon
in
cold
blood
while
engaged
in
lawful
and
peaceful
action
what
possible
motive
could
these
boys
have
had
for
firing
upon
innocent
marching
soldiers
it
is
true
that
the
marchers
were
fired
upon
that
shots
were
fired
by
some
of
these
defendants
but
why
were
the
shots
fired

since
the
conviction
there
is
only
one
reason
why
they
were
defending
their
own
legal
property
against
unlawful
invasion
and
attack
they
were
defending
the
dwelling
place
of
britt

their
secretary
and
they
had
full
right
to
defend
their
lives
and
that
property
and
that
home
against
violence
or
destruction
they
had
a
right
to
use
force
if
necessary
to
effect
that
defense
the
law
gives
them
that
right
and
it
accrues
to
them
also
from
all
of
the
wells
of
elementary
justice
the
law
says
that
when
a
man
or
group
of
men
have
reason
to
fear
attack
from
superior
numbers
they
may
provide
whatever
protection
they
may
deem
necessary
to
repel
such
an
attack
and
it
says
also
that
if
a
man
who
is
in
bad
company
when
such
an
attack
is
made
happens
to
be
killed
by
the
defenders
those
defenders
are
not
to
be
considered
guilty
of
that
death
so
they
had
the
troops
come
to
blow
bugles
and
drill
in
the
streets
where
the
jury
could
see
their
power
however
wielded
was
great
enough
to
cause
governor
hart
to
send
the
soldiers
here
without
consulting
the
trial
judge
or
the
sheriff
whose
function
it
was
to
preserve
law
and
order
here
and
you
know
i
am
sure
that
law
and
order
were
adequately
preserved
here
before
the
troops
came
fearful
of
the
truth
they
tried
the
device
of
arresting
our
witnesses
for
alleged
perjury
hoping
to
discredit
those
witnesses
thus
in
your
eyes
because
they
knew
they
could
discredit
them
in
any
regular
nor
legitimate
way
fearful
of
the
truth
the
guilty
ones
at
centralia
deliberately
framed
up
evidence
to
save
themselves
from
blame
to
throw
the
responsibility
for
the
armistice
day
horror
onto
other
men
but
they
bungled
the
badly
no
bolder
nor
cruder
fabrication
has
ever
been
attempted

the
ridiculous
effort

you

to

of

by
the
prosecution
she
would
not
have
told
this

had
i
not
trapped
her
into
admitting
it
that
was
obvious
to
everybody
in
this
courtroom
that
day
you
have
heard
the
gentlemen
of
the
prosecution
assert
that
this
is
a
murder
trial
and
not
a
labor
trial
but
they
have
been
careful
to
ask
all
our
witnesses
whether
they
were
members
whether
they
belonged
to
any
labor
union
and
whether
they
were
sympathetic
towards
workers
on
trial
for
their
lives
and
when
the
answer
to
any
of
these
questions
was
yes
they
tried
to
brand
the
witness
as
one
not
worthy
of
belief
their
policy
and
thus
browbeating
working
people
who
were
called
as
witnesses
is
in
keeping
with
the
tactics
of
the
mob
during
the
days
when
it
held
centralia
in
its
grasp
you
know
even
if
the
detailed
story
has
been
barred
from
the
record
of
the
part
hubbard
lumber
baron
played
in
this
horror
at
centralia
you
have
heard
from
various
witnesses
that
the
lumber
mill
owned
by
hubbard
corporation
the
eastern
railway
and
lumber
company
is
a
notorious
concern
and
you
have
heard
it
said
that
abel
the
special
prosecutor
here
has
been
an
ardent
and
active
for
years
hubbard
wanted
to
drive
the
out
of
centralia
why
did
he
want
to
drive
them
out
he
said
they
were
a
menace
and
it
is
true
that
they
were
a
menace
and
are
a
menace
to
those
who
exploit
the
workers
who
produce
the
wealth
for
the
few
to
enjoy
why
were
ropes
carried
was
there
a
raid
on
the
hall
before
the
shooting
frank
bickford
a
reputable
physician
appeared
here
and
repeated
under
oath
what
he
had
sworn
to
at
the
coroner
inquest
that
when
the
parade
stopped
he
offered
to
lead
a
raid
on
the
hall
if
enough
would
follow
but
that
others
pushed
ahead
of
him
forced
open
the
door
and
then
the
shots
came
from
inside
and
why
did
the
rev
thompson
have
a
rope
thompson
believes
in
hanging
men
by
the
neck
until
they
are
dead
when
the
state
association
and
others
wanted
the
hanging
law
in
washington
revived
not
long
ago
the
reverend
thompson
lectured
in
many
cities
and
towns
in
behalf
of
that
law
and
he
has
since
lectured
widely
against
the
did
he
carry
a
rope
in
the
parade
because
he
owned
a
cow
and
a
calf
or
what
why
did
the
prosecution
need
so
many
attorneys
here
if
it
had
the
facts
straight
why
were
scores
of
american
legion
members
imported
here
to
sit
at
the
trial
at
a
wage
of
per
day
and
expenses
they
have
told
you
this
was
a
murder
trial
and
not
a
labor
trial
but
vastly
more
than
the
lives
of
ten
men
are
the
stakes
in
the
big
gamble
here
for
the
right
of
workers
to
organize
for
the
bettering
of
their
own
condition
is
on
trial
the
right
of
free
assemblage
is
on
trial
democracy
and
americanism
are
on
trial
in
our
opening
statement
we
promised
to
prove
various
facts
and
we
have
proven
them
in
the
main
if
there
are
any
contentions
about
which
the
evidence
remains
vague
this
circumstance
exists
only
because
his
honor
has
seen
fit
to
rule
out
certain
testimony
which
is
vital
to
the
case
and
we
believed
and
still
believe
was
entirely
material
and
properly
admissible
but
is
there
any
doubt
in
your
minds
that
there
was
a
conspiracy
to
raid
the
hall
and
to
run
the
industrial
workers
of
the
world
out
of

the

will
not
allow

to
read
the

issued
by
the
asking

from
the

have
you
any
doubt
that
the
had
reason
to
fear
an
attack
from

his

there
was
a
raid

the

brought
in

verdict

guilty
in

face
of
the
very
evident
ability
of
the
lumber
interests
to
satisfy
its
vengeance
at

any
other
verdict
would
have
been
suicidal
for

the
prosecution
was
out
for
blood
and
nothing
less
than
blood
day
by
day
they
had
built
the
structure
of
gallows
right
there

built

from

the
stand
to
braid
a

some
of
these
were
members
of
the
mob
on
their
white
hands
the
blood
of
wesley
everest
was
hardly
dry
and
they
were
not
satisfied
with
sending
their
victims
to
prison
for
terms

wanted
the
pleasure
of
seeing
their

broken

guilty

second
degree

instances
but
eugene

and
john

were
at
first
declared
guilty
of
manslaughter
or
murder
in
the
third
degree
in
the
first
findings
and
guilty
of
second
degree
murder
in
the
second
the
significant
point
is
that
the
state
made
its
strongest
argument
against
the
four
men
whom
the
jury
practically
exonerated
of
the
charge
of
conspiring
to
murder
more
significant
is
the
fact
that
the
whole
verdict
completely
upsets
the
charge
of
conspiracy
to
murder
under
which
the
men
were
tried
the
difference
between
first
and
second
degree
murder
is
that
the
former
first
degree
implies
premeditation
while
the
other
second
degree
means
murder
that
is
not
premeditated
now
how
in
the
world
can
men
be
found
guilty
of
conspiring
to
murder
without
previous
premeditation
the
verdict
brutal
and
stupid
as
it
is
shows
the
weakness
and
falsity
of
the
state
charge
more
eloquently
than
anything
the
defense
has
ever
said
about
it
but
labor
says
not
guilty
but
another
jury
had
been
watching
the
trial
their
verdict
came
as
a
surprise
to
those
who
had
read
the
newspaper
version
of
the
case
no
sooner
had
the
twelve
bewildered
and
frightened
men
in
the
jury
box
paid
tribute
to
the
power
of
the
lumber
trust
with
a
ludicrous
and
tragic
verdict
than
the
six
workingmen
of
the
labor
jury
returned
their
verdict
also
those
six
men
represented
as
many
labor
organizations
in
the
pacific
northwest
with
a
combined
membership
of
many
thousands
of
wage
earners
the
last
echoes
of
the
prolonged
legal
battle
had
hardly
died
away
when
these
six
men
sojourned
to
tacoma
to
ballot
deliberate
and
to
reach
their
decision
about
the
disputed
facts
of
the
case
at
the
very
moment
when
the
newspapers
frantic
with
disappointment
were
again
raising
the
of
their
pack
the
frank
and
positive
statement
of
these
six
workers
came
like
a
thunderclap
out
of
a
clear
sky
not
guilty
the
labor
jury
had
studied
the
development
of
the
case
with
earnest
attention
from
the
beginning
day
by
day
they
had
watched
with
increasing
astonishment
the
efforts
of
the
defense
to
present
and
of
the
prosecution
and
the
judge
to
exclude
from
the
consideration
of
the
trial
jury
the
things
everybody
knew
to
be
true
about
the
tragedy
at
centralia
day
by
day
the
sordid
drama
had
been
unfolded
before
their
eyes
day
by
day
the
conviction
had
grown
upon
them
that
the
loggers
on
trial
for
their
lives
were
being
railroaded
to
the
gallows
by
the
legal
hirelings
of
the
lumber
trust
the
labor
jury
was
composed
of
men
with
experience
in
the
labor
movement
they
had
eyes
to
see
through
a
maze
of
red
tape
and
legal
mummery
to
the
simple
truth
that
was
being
hidden
or
obscured
the
lumber
trust
did
not
fool
these
men
and
it
could
not
intimidate
them
they
had
the
courage
to
give
the
truth
to
the
world
just
as
they
saw
it
they
were
convinced
in
their
hearts
and
minds
that
the
loggers
on
trial
were
innocent
and
they
would
have
been
just
as
honest
and
just
as
fearless
had
their
convictions
been
otherwise
it
can
not
be
said
that
the
labor
jury
was
biased
in
favor
of
the
defendants
or
of
the
if
anything
they
were
predisposed
to
believe
the
defendants
guilty
and
their
union
an
outlaw
organization
it
must
be
remembered
that
all
the
labor
jury
knew
of
the
case
was
what
it
had
read
in
the
capitalist
newspapers
prior
to
their
arrival
at
the
scene
of
the
trial
these
men
were
not
radicals
but
representative
working
men
members
of
conservative
unions
who
had
been
instructed
by
their
organizations
to
observe
impartially
the
progress
of
the
trial

to
report
back
to
their
unions

was
evidence
offered
by

to
show
that

held

at

on

at
which
ways
and
means

with

were
discussed
hubbard
chief

and
william

commander
of
the
american

at
centralia
were
present
prosecuting
attorney

was
quoted
as
having
said
there
is
no
law
that
would
let
you
run
the
out
of

chief
of

hughes
said
you
can
not

they
have

hubbard
said
it
a
damn
shame
if
i
was
chief
i
would
have
them
out

in

william
scales
presiding
at
the
meeting
said
that
although
he
was
not
in
favor
of
a
raid
there
was
no
american
jury
that
would
convict
them
if
they
did
or
words
to
that
effect
he
then
announced
that
he
would
appoint
a
secret
committee
to
deal
with
the
situation
was
the

unlawfully
raided
verdict
yes
the
evidence
introduced
convinces

that
an
attack
was
made
before
a

fired
had
the
defendants
a
right
to
defend
their
hall
verdict
yes
on
a
former
occasion
the
hall
was
raided
furniture
destroyed
and
stolen
ropes
placed
around
their
necks
and
they
were
otherwise
abused
and
driven
out
of
town
by
citizens
armed
with
pick
handles
was
warren
grimm
a
party
to
the
conspiracy
of
raiding
the
hall
verdict
yes
the
evidence
introduced
convinces
us
that
warren
grimm
participated
in
the
raid
of
the
hall
to
our
minds
the
most
convincing
evidence
that
grimm
was
in
front
of
and
raiding
the
hall
with
others
is
the
evidence
of
state
witness
van
gilder
who
testified
that
he
stood
at
the
side
of
grimm
at
the
intersection
of
second
street
and
tower
avenue
when
according
to
his
testimony
grimm
was
shot
this
testimony
was
refuted
by
five
witnesses
who
testified
that
they
saw
grimm
coming
wounded
from
the
direction
of
the
hall
it
is
not
credible
that
van
gilder
who
was
a
personal
and
intimate
friend
of
grimm
would
leave
him
when
he
was
mortally
wounded
to
walk
half
a
block
alone
and
unaided
did
the
defendants
get
a
fair
and
impartial
trial
verdict
no
the
most
damaging
evidence
of
a
conspiracy
by
the
business
men
of
centralia
of
a
raid
on
the
hall
was
ruled
out
by
the
court
and
not
permitted
to
go
to
the
jury
this
was
one
of
the
principal
issues
that
the
defense
sought
to
establish
also
the
calling
of
the
federal
troops
by
prosecuting
attorney
allen
was
for
no
other
reason
than
to
create
atmosphere
on
interviewing
the
judge
sheriff
and
prosecuting
attorney
the
judge
and
the
sheriff
informed
us
that
in
their
opinion
the
troops
were
not
needed
and
that
they
were
brought
there
without
their
consent
or
knowledge
in
the
interview
allen
promised
to
furnish
the
substance
of
the
evidence
which
in
his
opinion
necessitated
the
presence
of
the
troops
the
next
morning
but
on
the
following
day
he
declined
the
information
he
however
did
say
that
he
did
not
fear
the
but
was
afraid
of
violence
by
the
american
legion
this
confession
came
after
he
was
shown
by
us
the
fallacy
of
the
coming
armed
to
interfere
with
the
verdict
also
the
presence
of
the
american
legion

large
numbers
