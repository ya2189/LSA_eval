chapter
i
concerning
the
pretty
lady
she
was
such
a
pretty
lady
and
gentle
withal
so
quiet
and
eminently
ladylike
in
her
behavior
and
yet
dignified
and
haughtily
reserved
as
a
duchess
still
it
is
better
under
certain
circumstances
to
be
a
cat
than
to
be
a
duchess
and
no
duchess
of
the
realm
ever
had
more
faithful
retainers
or
half
so
abject
subjects
do
not
tell
me
that
cats
never
love
people
that
only
places
have
real
hold
upon
their
affections
the
pretty
lady
was
contented
wherever
i
her
most
humble
slave
went
with
her
she
migrated
with
me
from
to
cottage
then
to
regular
housekeeping
up
to
the
mountains
for
a
summer
and
back
home
a
long
day
journey
on
the
railway
and
her
attitude
was
always
wheresoever
thou
goest
i
will
go
and
thy
people
shall
be
my
people
i
have
known
and
loved
and
studied
many
cats
but
my
knowledge
of
her
alone
would
convince
me
that
cats
love
people
in
their
dignified
reserved
way
and
when
they
feel
that
their
love
is
not
wasted
that
they
reason
and
that
they
seldom
act
from
impulse
i
do
not
remember
that
i
was
born
with
an
inordinate
fondness
for
cats
or
that
i
cried
for
them
as
an
infant
i
do
not
know
even
that
my
childhood
was
marked
by
an
overweening
pride
in
them
this
perhaps
was
because
my
cruel
parents
established
a
decree
rigid
and
unbending
as
the
laws
of
the
medes
and
persians
that
we
must
never
have
more
than
one
cat
at
a
time
although
this
very
law
may
argue
that
predilection
at
an
early
age
for
harboring
everything
feline
which
came
in
my
way
which
has
since
become
at
once
a
source
of
comfort
and
distraction
after
a
succession
of
feline
dynasties
the
kings
and
queens
of
which
were
handsome
ugly
sleek
forlorn
black
white
deaf
spotted
and
otherwise
marked
i
remember
fastening
my
affections
securely
upon
one
kitten
who
grew
up
to
be
the
ugliest
gauntest
and
dingiest
specimen
i
ever
have
seen
in
the
days
of
his
kittenhood
i
christened
him
tassie
after
his
mother
but
as
time
sped
on
and
the
name
hardly
comported
with
masculine
dignity
this
was
changed
to
tacitus
as
more
befitting
his
sex
he
had
a
habit
of
dodging
in
and
out
of
the
front
door
which
was
heavy
and
which
sometimes
swung
together
before
he
was
well
out
of
it
as
a
consequence
a
caudal
appendage
with
two
broken
joints
was
one
of
his
distinguishing
features
besides
a
broken
tail
he
had
ears
which
bore
the
marks
of
many
a
battle
and
an
expression
which
for
general
lone
and
lorn
would
have
discouraged
even
gummidge
but
i
loved
him
and
judging
from
the
disconsolate
and
wailing
with
which
he
rilled
the
house
whenever
i
was
away
my
affection
was
not
unrequited
but
my
real
thraldom
did
not
begin
until
i
took
the
pretty
mother
we
had
not
been
a
week
in
our
first
house
before
a
handsomely
striped
tabby
with
eyes
like
beautiful
emeralds
who
had
been
the
pet
and
pride
of
the
neighbor
for
five
years
came
over
and
domiciled
herself
in
due
course
of
time
she
proudly
presented
us
with
five
kittens
educated
in
the
belief
that
one
cat
was
all
that
was
compatible
with
respectability
i
had
four
immediately
disposed
of
keeping
the
prettiest
one
which
grew
up
into
the
beautiful
fascinating
and
seductive
maltese
pretty
lady
with
white
trimmings
to
her
coat
the
mother
of
pretty
lady
used
to
catch
two
mice
at
a
time
and
bringing
them
in
together
lay
one
at
my
feet
and
say
as
plainly
as
cat
language
can
say
there
you
eat
that
one
and
i
eat
this
and
then
seem
much
surprised
and
disgusted
that
i
had
not
devoured
mine
when
she
had
finished
her
meal
we
were
occupying
a
furnished
house
for
the
summer
however
and
as
we
were
to
board
through
the
winter
i
took
only
the
kitten
back
to
town
thinking
the
mother
would
return
to
her
former
home
just
over
the
fence
but
no
for
two
weeks
she
refused
all
food
and
would
not
once
enter
the
other
house
then
i
went
out
for
her
and
hearing
my
voice
she
came
in
and
sat
down
before
me
literally
scolding
me
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
i
shall
be
laughed
at
but
actual
tears
stood
in
her
lovely
green
eyes
and
ran
down
her
aristocratic
nose
attesting
her
grief
and
accusing
me
louder
than
her
wailing
of
perfidy
i
could
not
keep
her
she
would
not
return
to
her
old
home
i
finally
compromised
by
carrying
her
in
a
covered
basket
a
mile
and
a
half
and
bestowing
her
upon
a
friend
who
loves
cats
nearly
as
well
as
i
but
although
she
was
petted
and
praised
and
fed
on
the
choicest
of
delicacies
she
would
not
be
resigned
after
six
weeks
of
mourning
she
disappeared
and
never
was
heard
of
more
whether
she
sought
a
new
and
more
constant
mistress
or
whether
in
her
grief
at
my
shameless
abandonment
of
her
she
went
to
some
lonely
pier
and
threw
herself
off
the
dock
will
never
be
known
but
her
reproachful
gaze
and
tearful
emerald
eyes
haunted
me
all
winter
many
a
restless
night
did
i
have
to
reproach
myself
for
abandoning
a
creature
who
so
truly
loved
me
and
in
many
a
dream
did
she
return
to
heap
shame
and
ignominy
upon
my
repentant
head
this
experience
determined
me
to
cherish
her
daughter
whom
rather
i
cherished
as
her
son
until
there
were
three
little
kittens
which
in
a
moment
of
ignorance
i
disposed
of
at
once
naturally
the
young
mother
fell
exceedingly
ill
in
the
most
pathetic
way
she
dragged
herself
after
me
moaning
and
beseeching
for
help
finally
i
succumbed
went
to
a
neighbor
where
several
superfluous
kittens
had
arrived
the
night
before
and
begged
one
it
was
a
little
black
fellow
cold
and
half
dead
but
the
pretty
lady
was
beside
herself
with
joy
when
i
bestowed
it
upon
her
for
two
days
she
would
not
leave
the
box
where
i
established
their
headquarters
and
for
months
she
refused
to
wean
it
or
to
look
upon
it
as
less
than
absolutely
perfect
i
may
say
that
the
pretty
lady
lived
to
be
nine
years
old
and
had
during
that
brief
period
no
less
than
kittens
besides
two
adopted
ones
but
never
did
she
bestow
upon
any
of
her
own
offspring
that
wealth
of
pride
and
affection
which
was
showered
upon
black
bobbie
when
the
first
child
of
her
adoption
was
two
weeks
old
i
was
ill
one
morning
and
did
not
appear
at
breakfast
it
had
always
been
her
custom
to
wait
for
my
coming
down
in
the
morning
evidently
considering
it
a
not
unimportant
part
of
her
duty
to
see
me
well
launched
for
the
day
usually
she
sat
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
and
waited
patiently
until
she
heard
me
moving
about
sometimes
she
came
in
and
sat
on
a
chair
at
the
head
of
my
bed
or
gently
touched
my
face
with
her
nose
or
paw
although
she
knew
she
was
at
liberty
to
sleep
in
my
room
she
seldom
did
so
except
when
she
had
an
infant
on
her
hands
at
first
she
invariably
kept
him
in
a
lower
drawer
of
my
bureau
when
he
was
large
enough
she
removed
him
to
the
foot
of
the
bed
where
for
a
week
or
two
her
maternal
solicitude
and
sociable
habits
of
nocturnal
conversation
with
her
progeny
interfered
seriously
with
my
night
rest
if
my
friends
used
to
notice
a
wild
and
haggard
appearance
of
unrest
about
me
at
certain
periods
of
the
year
the
reason
stands
here
confessed
i
was
ill
when
black
bobbie
was
two
weeks
old
the
pretty
lady
waited
until
breakfast
was
over
and
as
i
did
not
appear
came
up
and
jumped
on
the
bed
where
she
manifested
some
curiosity
as
to
my
lack
of
active
interest
in
the
world
affairs
now
pussy
i
said
putting
out
my
hand
and
stroking
her
back
sick
this
morning
when
you
were
sick
i
went
and
got
you
a
kitten
ca
you
get
me
one
this
was
all
my
sister
came
in
then
and
spoke
to
me
and
the
pretty
lady
left
us
at
once
but
in
less
than
two
minutes
she
came
back
with
her
cherished
kitten
in
her
mouth
depositing
him
in
my
neck
she
stood
and
looked
at
me
as
much
as
to
say
there
you
can
take
him
awhile
he
cured
me
and
i
wo
be
selfish
i
will
share
him
with
you
i
was
ill
for
three
days
and
all
that
time
the
kitten
was
kept
with
me
when
his
mother
wanted
him
she
kept
him
on
the
foot
of
the
bed
where
she
nursed
and
lapped
and
scrubbed
him
until
it
seemed
as
if
she
must
wear
even
his
stolid
nerves
completely
out
but
whenever
she
felt
like
going
out
she
brought
him
up
and
tucked
him
away
in
the
hollow
of
my
neck
with
a
little
guttural
noise
that
interpreted
meant
there
now
you
take
care
of
him
awhile
i
all
tired
out
do
wake
him
up
but
when
the
infant
had
dropped
soundly
asleep
she
invariably
came
back
and
demanded
him
and
not
only
demanded
but
dragged
him
forth
from
his
lair
by
the
nape
of
the
neck
shrieking
and
protesting
to
the
foot
of
the
bed
again
where
he
was
obliged
to
go
through
another
course
of
scrubbing
and
vigorous
maternal
attentions
that
actually
kept
his
fur
from
growing
as
fast
as
the
coats
of
less
devotedly
kittens
grow
when
i
was
well
enough
to
leave
my
room
she
transferred
him
to
my
lower
bureau
drawer
and
then
to
a
behind
an
old
lounge
but
she
never
doubted
apparently
that
it
was
the
loan
of
that
kitten
that
rescued
me
from
an
untimely
grave
i
have
lost
many
an
hour
of
sleep
from
my
cat
habit
of
coming
upstairs
at
four
and
jumping
suddenly
upon
the
bed
perhaps
landing
on
the
pit
of
my
stomach
waking
in
that
fashion
unsympathetic
persons
would
have
pardoned
me
if
i
had
indulged
in
injudicious
language
or
had
even
thrown
the
cat
violently
from
my
otherwise
peaceful
couch
but
conscience
has
not
to
upbraid
me
with
any
of
these
things
i
flatter
myself
that
i
bear
even
this
patiently
i
remember
to
have
often
made
sleepy
but
pleasant
remarks
to
the
faithful
little
friend
whose
affection
for
me
and
whose
desire
to
behold
my
countenance
was
too
great
to
permit
her
to
wait
till
breakfast
time
if
i
lay
awake
for
hours
afterward
perhaps
getting
nothing
more
than
literal
i
consoled
myself
with
remembering
how
richelieu
and
wellington
and
mohammed
and
otherwise
great
as
well
as
discriminating
persons
loved
cats
i
remembered
with
some
stirrings
of
secret
pride
that
it
is
only
the
artistic
nature
the
truly
aesthetic
soul
that
appreciates
poetry
and
grace
and
all
refined
beauty
who
truly
loves
cats
and
thus
meditating
with
closed
eyes
i
courted
slumber
again
throughout
the
breaking
dawn
while
the
cat
purred
in
delight
close
at
hand
the
pretty
lady
was
evidently
of
angora
or
coon
descent
as
her
fur
was
always
longer
and
silkier
than
that
of
ordinary
cats
she
was
fond
of
all
the
family
when
we
boarded
in
boston
we
kept
her
in
a
front
room
two
flights
from
the
ground
whenever
any
of
us
came
in
the
front
door
she
knew
it
no
human
being
could
have
told
sitting
in
a
closed
room
in
winter
two
flights
up
the
identity
of
a
person
coming
up
the
steps
and
opening
the
door
but
the
pretty
lady
then
only
six
months
old
used
to
rouse
from
her
nap
in
a
big
chair
or
from
the
top
of
a
folding
bed
jump
down
and
be
at
the
hall
door
ready
to
greet
the
incomer
before
she
was
halfway
up
the
stairs
the
cat
never
got
down
for
the
wrong
person
and
she
never
neglected
to
meet
any
and
every
member
of
our
family
who
might
be
entering
the
irreverent
scoffer
may
call
it
instinct
or
talk
about
the
sense
of
smell
i
call
it
sagacity
one
summer
we
all
went
up
to
the
farm
in
northern
vermont
and
decided
to
take
her
and
her
son
mcginty
with
us
we
put
them
both
in
a
large
and
tied
the
cover
securely
on
the
train
mcginty
manifested
a
desire
to
get
out
and
was
allowed
to
do
so
a
stout
cord
having
been
secured
to
his
collar
first
and
the
other
end
tied
to
the
car
seat
he
had
a
delightful
journey
once
used
to
the
noise
and
motion
of
the
train
he
sat
on
our
laps
curled
up
on
the
seat
and
took
naps
or
looked
out
of
the
windows
with
evident
puzzlement
at
the
way
things
had
suddenly
taken
to
flying
he
even
made
friends
with
the
passengers
and
in
general
amused
himself
as
any
other
traveller
would
on
an
journey
by
rail
except
that
he
did
not
risk
his
eyesight
by
reading
newspapers
but
the
pretty
lady
had
not
travelled
for
some
years
and
did
not
enjoy
the
trip
as
well
as
formerly
on
the
contrary
she
curled
herself
into
a
round
tight
ball
in
one
corner
of
the
basket
till
the
journey
end
was
reached
once
at
the
farm
she
seemed
contented
as
long
as
i
remained
with
her
there
was
plenty
of
milk
and
cream
and
she
caught
a
great
many
mice
she
was
far
too
dainty
to
eat
them
but
she
had
an
inherent
pleasure
in
catching
mice
just
like
her
more
plebeian
sisters
and
she
enjoyed
presenting
them
to
mcginty
or
me
or
some
other
worthy
object
of
her
solicitude
she
was
at
first
afraid
of
the
big
outdoors
the
wide
spaces
the
broad
sunshiny
sky
the
silence
and
the
roominess
of
it
all
were
quite
different
from
her
suburban
experiences
and
the
farm
animals
too
were
in
her
opinion
curiously
dangerous
objects
big
dan
the
horse
was
truly
a
horrible
creature
the
rooster
was
a
new
and
suspicious
species
of
biped
and
the
bleating
calves
objects
of
her
direst
hatred
the
pig
in
his
pen
possessed
for
her
the
most
horrid
fascination
again
and
again
would
she
steal
out
and
place
herself
where
she
could
see
that
dreadful
strange
pink
fat
creature
inside
his
own
quarters
she
would
fix
her
round
eyes
widely
upon
him
in
blended
fear
and
admiration
if
the
pig
uttered
the
characteristic
grunt
of
his
race
the
pretty
lady
at
first
ran
swiftly
away
but
afterward
she
used
to
turn
and
gaze
anxiously
at
us
as
if
to
say
do
you
hear
that
is
this
a
truly
horrible
creature
and
in
other
ways
evince
the
same
sort
of
surprise
that
a
professor
in
the
peabody
museum
might
were
the
skeleton
of
the
megatherium
suddenly
to
accost
him
after
the
manner
peculiar
to
its
kind
it
was
funnier
even
to
see
mcginty
on
the
morning
after
his
arrival
at
the
farm
as
he
sallied
forth
and
made
acquaintance
with
other
of
god
creatures
than
humans
and
cats
and
the
natural
enemy
of
his
kind
the
dog
in
his
suburban
home
he
had
caught
rats
and
captured
on
the
sly
many
an
english
sparrow
when
he
first
investigated
his
new
quarters
on
the
farm
he
discovered
a
beautiful
flock
of
very
large
birds
led
by
one
of
truly
gorgeous
plumage
ah
thought
mcginty
this
is
a
great
and
glorious
country
where
i
can
have
such
birds
as
these
for
the
catching
tame
too
i
have
one
for
breakfast
so
he
crouched
down
and
crept
carefully
along
to
a
convenient
distance
and
was
preparing
to
spring
when
the
large
and
gorgeous
bird
looked
up
from
his
worm
and
remarked
and
taking
his
wives
withdrew
toward
the
barn
mcginty
drew
back
amazed
this
is
a
queer
bird
he
seemed
to
say
saucy
too
however
i
soon
have
him
and
he
crept
more
carefully
than
before
up
to
springing
distance
when
again
this
most
gorgeous
bird
drew
up
and
exclaimed
with
a
note
of
annoyance
what
ails
that
old
cat
anyway
and
again
he
led
his
various
wives
mcginty
drew
up
with
a
surprised
air
and
apparently
made
a
cursory
study
of
the
leading
anatomical
features
of
this
strange
bird
but
he
did
not
like
to
give
up
and
soon
crouched
and
prepared
for
another
onslaught
this
time
chanticleer
allowed
the
cat
to
come
up
close
to
his
flock
when
he
turned
and
remarked
in
the
most
amicable
manner
which
interpreted
seemed
to
mean
come
now
all
right
you
evidently
new
here
but
you
better
take
my
advice
and
not
fool
with
me
anyhow
with
this
down
went
mcginty
hope
of
a
bird
breakfast
to
the
bottom
of
the
sea
and
he
gave
up
the
hunt
he
soon
made
friends
however
with
every
animal
on
the
place
and
so
endeared
himself
to
the
owners
that
he
lived
out
his
days
there
with
a
hundred
acres
and
more
as
his
own
happy
not
so
the
pretty
lady
i
went
away
on
a
short
visit
after
a
few
weeks
leaving
her
behind
from
the
moment
of
my
disappearance
she
was
uneasy
and
unhappy
on
the
fifth
day
she
disappeared
when
i
returned
and
found
her
not
i
am
not
ashamed
to
say
that
i
hunted
and
called
her
everywhere
nor
even
that
i
shed
a
few
tears
when
days
rolled
into
weeks
and
she
did
not
appear
as
i
realized
that
she
might
be
starving
or
have
suffered
tortures
from
some
larger
animal
there
are
many
remarkable
stories
of
cats
who
find
their
way
home
across
almost
impossible
roads
and
enormous
distances
there
is
a
saying
believed
by
many
people
you
ca
lose
a
cat
which
can
be
proved
by
hundreds
of
remarkable
returns
but
the
pretty
lady
had
absolutely
no
sense
of
locality
she
had
always
lived
indoors
and
had
never
been
allowed
to
roam
the
neighborhood
it
was
five
weeks
before
we
found
trace
of
her
and
then
only
by
accident
my
sister
was
passing
a
field
of
grain
and
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
small
creature
which
she
at
first
thought
to
be
a
woodchuck
she
turned
and
looked
at
it
and
called
pussy
pussy
when
with
a
little
cry
of
utter
delight
and
surprise
our
beloved
cat
came
toward
her
from
the
first
the
wide
expanse
of
the
country
had
confused
her
she
had
evidently
lost
her
bearings
and
was
probably
all
the
time
within
fifteen
minutes
walk
of
the
when
found
she
was
only
a
shadow
of
herself
and
for
the
first
and
only
time
in
her
life
we
could
count
her
ribs
she
was
wild
with
delight
and
clung
to
my
sister
arms
as
though
fearing
to
lose
her
and
in
all
the
fuss
that
was
made
over
her
return
no
human
being
could
have
showed
more
affection
or
more
satisfaction
at
finding
her
old
friends
again
that
she
really
was
lost
and
had
no
sense
of
locality
to
guide
her
home
was
proven
by
her
conduct
after
she
returned
to
her
boston
home
i
had
preceded
my
sister
and
was
at
the
theatre
on
the
evening
when
she
arrived
with
the
pretty
lady
the
latter
was
carried
into
the
kitchen
taken
from
her
basket
and
fed
then
instead
of
going
around
the
house
and
settling
herself
in
her
old
home
she
went
into
the
front
hall
which
she
had
left
four
months
before
and
seated
herself
on
the
spot
where
she
always
watched
and
waited
when
i
was
out
when
i
came
home
at
eleven
i
saw
through
the
screen
door
her
that
was
lost
and
is
found
she
had
been
waiting
to
welcome
me
for
three
mortal
hours
i
wish
those
people
who
believe
cats
have
no
affection
for
people
could
have
seen
her
then
she
would
not
leave
me
for
an
instant
and
manifested
her
love
in
every
possible
way
and
when
i
retired
for
the
night
she
curled
up
on
my
pillow
and
purred
herself
contentedly
to
sleep
only
rising
when
i
did
after
breakfast
that
first
morning
after
her
return
she
asked
to
be
let
out
of
the
back
door
and
made
me
understand
that
i
must
go
with
her
i
did
so
and
she
explored
every
part
of
the
back
yard
entreating
me
in
the
same
way
she
called
her
kittens
to
keep
close
by
her
she
investigated
our
own
premises
thoroughly
and
then
crept
carefully
under
the
fences
on
either
side
into
the
neighbor
precincts
where
she
had
formerly
visited
in
friendly
fashion
then
she
came
timidly
back
all
the
time
keeping
watch
that
she
did
not
lose
me
having
finished
her
tour
of
inspection
she
went
in
and
led
me
on
an
investigating
trip
all
through
the
house
smelling
of
every
corner
and
and
insisting
that
every
closet
door
should
be
opened
so
that
she
might
smell
each
closet
through
in
the
same
way
when
this
was
done
she
settled
herself
in
one
of
her
old
nooks
for
a
nap
and
allowed
me
to
leave
but
never
again
did
she
go
out
of
sight
of
the
house
for
more
than
a
year
she
would
not
go
even
into
a
neighbor
yard
and
when
she
finally
decided
that
it
might
be
safe
to
crawl
under
the
fences
on
to
other
territory
she
invariably
turned
about
to
sit
facing
the
house
as
though
living
up
to
a
firm
determination
never
to
lose
sight
of
it
again
this
practice
she
kept
up
until
at
the
close
of
her
last
mortal
sickness
when
she
crawled
into
a
dark
place
under
a
neighboring
barn
and
said
to
earthly
fears
and
worries
forever
in
my
pretty
lady
i
wish
all
your
sex
had
your
gentle
dignity
and
grace
and
beauty
to
say
nothing
of
your
faithfulness
and
affection
like
mother
michel
monmouth
it
may
be
said
of
you
she
was
merely
a
cat
but
her
sublime
virtues
place
her
on
a
level
with
the
most
celebrated
mortals
and
in
ancient
egypt
altars
would
have
been
erected
to
her
memory
chapter
ii
concerning
my
other
cats
oh
what
a
lovely
cat
is
a
frequent
expression
from
visitors
or
at
our
house
and
from
the
pretty
lady
down
through
her
various
sons
and
daughters
to
the
present
family
protector
and
head
thomas
erastus
and
the
angora
lady
betty
there
have
been
some
beautiful
creatures
mcginty
was
a
maltese
with
fur
like
a
seal
for
closeness
and
softness
and
with
the
disposition
of
an
angel
he
used
to
be
seized
with
sudden
spasms
of
affection
and
run
from
one
to
another
of
the
family
rubbing
his
soft
cheeks
against
ours
and
kissing
us
repeatedly
this
he
did
by
taking
gentle
little
affectionate
nips
with
his
teeth
i
used
to
give
him
a
certain
caress
which
he
took
as
an
expression
of
affection
after
leaving
him
at
the
farm
i
did
not
see
him
again
for
two
years
then
on
a
short
visit
i
asked
for
mcginty
and
was
told
that
he
was
in
a
shed
chamber
i
found
him
asleep
in
a
box
of
grain
and
took
him
out
he
looked
at
me
through
sleepy
eyes
turned
himself
over
and
stretched
up
for
the
old
caress
as
nobody
ever
gave
him
that
but
me
i
take
this
as
conclusive
proof
that
he
not
only
knew
me
but
remembered
my
one
peculiarity
then
there
was
old
pomp
called
old
to
distinguish
him
from
the
young
pomp
of
or
pompanita
he
died
of
pneumonia
at
the
age
of
three
years
but
he
was
the
handsomest
black
cat
and
the
blackest
i
have
ever
seen
he
had
half
a
dozen
white
hairs
under
his
chin
but
his
blackness
was
literally
like
the
raven
wing
many
handsome
black
cats
show
brown
in
the
strong
sunlight
or
when
their
fur
is
parted
but
old
pomp
fur
was
jet
black
clear
through
and
in
the
sunshine
looked
as
if
he
had
been
made
up
of
the
richest
black
silk
velvet
his
eyes
meanwhile
being
large
and
of
the
purest
amber
he
weighed
some
fifteen
pounds
and
that
somebody
envied
us
the
possession
of
him
was
evident
as
he
was
stolen
two
or
three
times
during
the
last
summer
of
his
life
but
he
came
home
every
time
only
when
death
finally
stole
him
we
had
no
redress
bobinette
the
black
kitten
referred
to
in
the
previous
chapter
also
had
remarkably
beautiful
eyes
we
used
to
keep
him
in
ribbons
to
match
and
he
knew
color
too
perfectly
well
for
instance
if
we
offered
him
a
blue
or
a
red
ribbon
he
would
not
be
quiet
long
enough
to
have
it
tied
on
but
show
him
a
yellow
one
and
he
would
prance
across
the
room
and
not
only
stand
still
to
have
it
put
on
but
purr
and
evince
the
greatest
pride
in
it
bobinette
had
another
very
pretty
trick
of
playing
with
the
he
used
to
bring
it
to
us
and
have
it
wound
several
times
around
his
body
then
he
would
chase
himself
until
he
got
it
off
when
he
would
bring
it
back
and
ask
plainly
to
have
it
wound
round
him
again
after
a
little
we
noticed
he
was
wearing
the
out
and
so
we
tried
to
substitute
it
with
an
old
ribbon
or
piece
of
cotton
tape
but
bobinette
would
have
none
of
them
on
the
contrary
he
repeatedly
climbed
on
to
the
table
and
to
the
and
hunted
patiently
for
his
and
even
if
it
were
hidden
in
a
pocket
he
kept
up
the
search
until
he
unearthed
it
and
he
would
invariably
end
by
dragging
forth
that
particular
and
bringing
it
to
us
i
need
not
say
that
his
intelligence
was
rewarded
speaking
of
colors
a
friend
has
a
cat
that
is
devoted
to
blue
when
she
puts
on
a
particularly
pretty
blue
gown
the
cat
hastens
to
get
into
her
lap
put
her
face
down
to
the
material
purr
and
manifest
the
greatest
delight
but
let
the
same
lady
put
on
a
black
dress
and
the
cat
will
not
come
near
her
pompanita
the
second
pomp
in
our
dynasty
is
a
fat
and
billowy
black
fellow
now
five
years
old
and
weighing
nineteen
pounds
he
was
the
last
of
the
pretty
lady
children
only
a
few
of
this
vast
progeny
however
grew
to
as
she
was
never
allowed
to
keep
more
than
one
each
season
the
pretty
lady
in
fact
came
to
regard
this
as
the
only
proper
method
on
one
occasion
i
had
been
away
all
day
when
i
got
home
at
night
the
housekeeper
said
pussy
has
had
five
kittens
but
she
wo
go
near
them
when
the
pretty
lady
heard
my
voice
she
came
and
led
the
way
to
the
back
room
where
the
kittens
were
in
the
lower
drawer
of
an
unused
bureau
and
uttered
one
or
two
funny
little
noises
intimating
that
matters
were
not
altogether
as
they
should
be
according
to
established
rules
of
propriety
i
understood
abstracted
four
of
the
five
kittens
and
disappeared
when
i
came
back
she
had
settled
herself
contentedly
with
the
remaining
kitten
and
from
that
time
on
was
a
model
mother
pompanita
the
good
has
all
the
virtues
of
a
good
cat
and
absolutely
no
vices
he
loves
us
all
and
loves
all
other
cats
as
well
as
for
fighting
he
emulates
the
example
of
that
veteran
who
boasts
that
during
the
war
he
might
always
be
found
where
the
shot
and
shell
were
the
thickest
under
the
ammunition
wagon
like
most
cats
he
has
a
decided
streak
of
vanity
my
sister
cut
a
wide
fancy
collar
or
ruff
of
white
paper
one
day
and
put
it
on
pompanita
at
first
he
felt
much
abashed
and
found
it
almost
impossible
to
walk
with
it
but
a
few
words
of
praise
and
encouragement
changed
all
that
oh
what
a
pretty
pomp
he
is
now
exclaimed
one
and
another
until
he
sat
up
coyly
and
cocked
his
head
one
side
as
if
to
say
oh
now
do
you
really
think
i
look
pretty
and
after
a
few
more
assurances
he
got
down
and
strutted
as
proudly
as
any
peacock
much
to
the
discomfiture
of
the
kitten
who
wanted
to
play
with
him
and
now
he
will
cross
the
yard
any
time
to
have
one
of
those
collars
on
but
thomas
erastus
is
the
prince
of
our
cats
he
weighs
seventeen
pounds
and
is
a
soft
with
white
paws
and
breast
one
saturday
night
ten
years
ago
as
we
were
partaking
of
our
regular
boston
baked
beans
i
heard
a
faint
mew
looking
down
i
saw
beside
me
the
thinnest
kitten
i
ever
beheld
the
irish
girl
who
presided
over
our
fortunes
at
the
time
used
to
place
the
palms
of
her
hands
together
and
say
of
thomas
appearance
why
mum
the
two
sides
of
were
just
like
that
i
picked
him
up
and
he
crawled
pathetically
into
my
neck
and
cuddled
down
there
said
a
friend
who
was
sitting
opposite
he
fixed
himself
now
you
keep
him
no
i
shall
not
i
said
but
i
will
feed
him
a
few
days
and
give
him
to
my
cousin
inside
half
an
hour
however
thomas
erastus
had
assumed
the
paternal
air
toward
us
that
soon
made
us
fear
to
lose
him
living
without
thomas
now
would
be
like
a
young
girl
going
out
without
a
chaperone
after
that
first
when
he
had
been
fed
he
chased
every
foreign
cat
off
the
premises
and
assumed
the
part
of
a
to
this
day
he
will
sit
on
the
front
porch
or
the
and
growl
if
he
sees
a
tramp
or
suspicious
character
approaching
he
always
goes
into
the
kitchen
when
the
calls
and
orders
his
meat
and
at
exactly
five
in
the
afternoon
when
the
meat
is
cut
up
and
distributed
leads
the
feline
portion
of
the
family
into
the
kitchen
thomas
knows
the
time
of
day
for
six
months
he
waked
up
one
housekeeper
at
exactly
seven
in
the
morning
never
varying
two
minutes
he
did
this
by
seating
himself
on
her
chest
and
gazing
steadfastly
in
her
face
usually
this
waked
her
but
if
she
did
not
yield
promptly
to
that
treatment
he
would
poke
her
cheeks
with
the
most
velvety
of
paws
until
she
awoke
he
has
a
habit
now
of
going
upstairs
and
sitting
opposite
the
closed
door
of
the
young
man
who
has
to
rise
hours
before
the
rest
of
us
do
and
waiting
until
the
door
is
opened
for
him
how
he
knows
at
what
particular
moment
each
member
of
the
family
will
wake
up
and
come
forth
is
a
mystery
but
he
does
how
do
cats
tell
the
hour
of
day
anyway
the
old
chinese
theory
that
they
are
living
clocks
is
in
a
way
borne
out
by
their
own
conduct
not
only
have
my
cats
shown
repeatedly
that
they
know
the
hour
of
rising
of
every
member
of
the
family
but
they
gather
with
as
much
regularity
as
the
ebbing
of
the
tides
or
the
setting
of
the
sun
at
exactly
five
in
the
afternoon
for
their
supper
they
are
given
a
hearty
breakfast
as
soon
as
the
kitchen
fire
is
started
in
the
morning
this
theoretically
lasts
them
until
five
i
say
theoretically
because
if
they
wake
from
their
invariable
naps
at
one
and
smell
lunch
they
individually
wheedle
some
one
into
feeding
them
but
this
is
only
individually
collectively
they
are
fed
at
five
they
are
the
most
methodical
creatures
in
the
world
they
go
to
bed
regularly
at
night
when
the
family
does
they
are
waiting
in
the
kitchen
for
breakfast
when
the
fire
is
started
in
the
morning
then
they
go
out
of
doors
and
play
or
hunt
or
ruminate
until
ten
when
they
come
in
seek
their
favorite
and
sleep
until
four
evidently
from
four
to
five
is
a
play
hour
and
the
one
who
wakes
first
is
expected
to
stir
up
the
others
but
at
exactly
five
no
matter
where
they
may
have
strayed
to
every
one
of
the
three
five
or
seven
as
the
number
may
happen
to
be
will
be
sitting
in
his
own
particular
place
in
the
kitchen
waiting
with
patient
eagerness
for
supper
for
each
has
a
particular
place
for
eating
just
as
bigger
folk
have
their
places
at
the
dining
table
thomas
erastus
sits
in
a
corner
the
space
under
the
table
is
reserved
especially
for
jane
pompanita
is
at
his
feet
and
lady
betty
the
angora
bounds
to
her
shoulder
when
their
meat
appears
their
table
manners
are
quite
irreproachable
also
it
is
considered
quite
unpardonable
to
snatch
at
another
piece
of
meat
and
a
breach
of
the
best
to
show
impatience
while
another
is
being
fed
i
do
not
pretend
to
say
that
this
is
entirely
natural
they
are
taught
these
things
as
kittens
and
since
cats
are
as
great
sticklers
for
propriety
and
gentle
manners
as
any
human
beings
can
be
they
never
forget
it
doubtless
this
is
easier
because
they
are
always
well
fed
but
thomas
erastus
or
jane
would
have
to
be
on
the
verge
of
starvation
i
am
sure
before
they
would
grab
from
one
of
the
other
cats
and
as
for
the
pretty
lady
it
was
always
necessary
to
see
that
she
was
properly
served
she
would
not
eat
from
a
dish
with
other
cats
or
except
in
extreme
cases
from
one
they
had
left
indeed
she
was
remarkable
in
this
respect
i
have
seen
her
sit
on
the
edge
of
a
table
where
chickens
were
being
dressed
and
wait
patiently
for
a
tidbit
i
have
seen
her
left
alone
in
the
room
while
on
that
table
was
a
piece
of
raw
steak
but
no
temptation
was
ever
great
enough
to
make
her
touch
any
of
these
forbidden
things
she
actually
seemed
to
have
a
conscience
only
one
thing
on
the
dining
table
would
she
touch
when
she
was
two
or
three
months
old
she
somehow
got
hold
of
the
done
up
in
their
rings
these
were
always
to
her
the
most
delightful
playthings
in
the
world
as
a
kitten
she
would
play
with
them
by
the
hour
if
not
taken
away
and
go
to
sleep
cuddled
affectionately
around
them
she
got
over
this
as
she
grew
older
but
when
her
first
kitten
was
two
or
three
months
old
remembering
the
jolly
times
she
used
to
have
she
would
sneak
into
the
dining
room
and
get
the
rolled
napkins
carry
them
in
her
mouth
to
her
infant
and
endeavor
with
patient
anxiety
to
show
him
how
to
play
with
them
throughout
nine
years
of
motherhood
she
went
through
the
same
performance
with
every
kitten
she
had
they
never
knew
what
to
do
with
the
napkins
or
cared
to
know
and
would
have
none
of
them
but
she
never
got
discouraged
she
would
climb
up
on
the
sideboard
or
into
the
china
closet
and
even
try
to
get
into
drawers
where
the
napkins
were
laid
away
in
their
rings
if
she
could
get
hold
of
one
she
would
carry
it
with
literal
groans
and
evident
travail
of
spirit
to
her
kitten
and
by
further
groans
and
admonitions
seem
to
say
child
see
this
beautiful
plaything
i
have
brought
you
this
is
a
part
of
your
education
it
is
just
as
necessary
for
you
to
know
how
to
play
with
this
as
to
poke
your
paw
under
the
closet
door
properly
wake
up
now
and
play
with
it
sometimes
when
the
table
was
laid
over
night
we
used
to
hear
her
anguished
groans
in
the
stillness
of
the
night
in
the
morning
every
napkin
belonging
to
the
family
would
be
found
in
a
different
part
of
the
house
and
perhaps
a
ring
would
be
missing
these
periods
however
only
lasted
as
long
in
each
new
kitten
training
as
the
few
weeks
that
she
had
amused
herself
with
them
at
their
age
then
she
would
drop
the
subject
and
napkins
had
no
further
interest
than
the
man
in
the
moon
until
another
kitten
arrived
at
the
age
when
she
considered
them
a
necessary
part
of
his
education
professor
shaler
in
his
interesting
book
on
the
intelligence
of
animals
gives
the
cat
only
the
merest
mention
intimating
that
he
considers
them
below
par
in
this
respect
and
showing
little
real
knowledge
of
them
i
wish
he
might
have
known
the
pretty
lady
once
our
lady
betty
had
four
little
angora
kittens
she
was
probably
the
most
aristocratic
cat
in
the
country
for
she
kept
a
wet
nurse
poor
jane
of
commoner
strain
had
two
small
kittens
the
day
after
the
angora
family
appeared
jane
plebeian
infants
promptly
disappeared
but
she
took
just
as
promptly
to
the
more
aristocratic
family
and
fulfilled
the
duties
of
nurse
and
maid
both
cats
and
four
kittens
occupied
the
same
bureau
drawer
and
when
either
cat
wanted
the
fresh
air
she
left
the
other
in
charge
and
there
was
a
tacit
understanding
between
them
that
the
fluffy
fat
babies
must
never
be
left
alone
one
instant
four
small
and
lively
kittens
in
the
house
are
indeed
things
of
beauty
and
a
joy
as
long
as
they
last
four
fluffy
little
angora
balls
they
were
chin
chilla
buffie
and
orange
pekoe
names
that
explain
their
color
and
jane
wet
nurse
and
had
to
keep
as
busy
as
the
old
woman
that
lived
in
a
shoe
jane
it
was
who
must
look
after
the
infants
when
lady
betty
wished
to
leave
the
house
jane
it
was
who
must
scrub
the
furry
quartet
until
their
silky
fur
stood
up
in
bunches
the
wrong
way
all
over
their
chubby
little
sides
jane
must
sleep
with
them
nights
and
be
ready
to
furnish
sustenance
at
any
moment
of
day
or
night
and
above
all
jane
must
watch
them
anxiously
and
incessantly
in
waking
hours
uttering
those
little
protesting
murmurs
of
admonition
which
mother
cats
deem
so
necessary
toward
the
proper
training
of
kittens
and
poor
jane
as
lady
maid
she
must
bathe
lady
betty
brow
every
now
and
then
as
the
more
finely
strung
angora
succumbed
to
the
nervous
strain
of
and
she
turned
affectionately
to
jane
for
comfort
a
prettier
sight
or
a
more
profitable
study
of
the
love
of
animals
for
each
other
was
never
seen
than
lady
betty
her
infants
and
her
and
yet
there
are
people
who
pronounce
cats
stupid
one
evening
i
returned
from
the
theatre
late
and
roused
up
the
four
fluffy
kittens
who
seeing
the
gas
turned
on
started
in
for
a
frolic
the
lady
mother
did
not
approve
of
midnight
carousals
on
the
part
of
infants
and
protested
with
mild
wails
against
their
joyful
caperings
finally
orange
pekoe
got
into
the
closet
and
lady
betty
pursued
him
but
suddenly
a
strange
odor
was
detected
sitting
on
her
haunches
she
smelled
all
over
the
bottom
of
the
skirt
which
had
just
been
hung
up
stopping
every
few
seconds
to
utter
a
little
worried
note
of
warning
to
the
kittens
the
infants
however
displayed
a
quite
human
disregard
of
parental
authority
and
gambolled
on
unconcernedly
under
the
skirt
reminding
one
of
the
old
new
england
primer
style
of
tales
showing
how
disobedient
children
flaunt
themselves
in
the
face
of
danger
despite
the
judicious
advice
of
their
elders
lady
betty
could
do
nothing
with
them
and
grew
more
nervous
and
worried
every
minute
in
consequence
suddenly
she
bethought
herself
of
that
source
of
strength
and
comfort
jane
she
went
into
the
next
room
and
although
i
had
not
heard
a
sound
returned
in
a
moment
with
the
maltese
jane
was
ushered
into
the
closet
and
soon
scented
out
the
skirt
then
she
too
sat
on
her
haunches
and
gave
a
long
careful
sniff
turned
round
and
uttered
one
and
took
the
angora
off
with
her
jane
had
discovered
that
there
was
no
element
of
danger
in
the
closet
and
had
imparted
her
knowledge
to
the
finely
strung
angora
in
an
instant
and
so
taking
her
back
to
bed
she
bathed
her
brow
with
gentle
lappings
until
lady
betty
sank
off
to
quiet
sleep
soothed
and
comforted
it
is
not
easy
to
study
a
cat
they
are
like
sensitive
plants
and
shut
themselves
instinctively
away
from
the
human
being
who
does
not
care
for
them
they
know
when
a
man
or
a
woman
loves
them
almost
before
they
come
into
the
human
presence
and
it
is
almost
useless
for
the
unsympathetic
person
to
try
to
study
a
cat
but
the
thousands
who
do
love
cats
know
that
they
are
the
most
individual
animals
in
the
world
dogs
are
much
alike
in
their
love
for
mankind
their
obedience
faithfulness
and
in
different
degrees
their
sagacity
but
there
is
as
much
individuality
in
cats
as
in
people
dogs
and
horses
are
our
slaves
cats
never
this
does
not
prove
them
without
affection
as
some
people
seem
to
think
on
the
contrary
it
proves
their
peculiar
and
characteristic
dignity
and
women
poets
and
especially
artists
like
cats
delicate
natures
only
can
realize
their
sensitive
nervous
systems
the
pretty
lady
mother
talked
almost
incessantly
when
she
was
in
the
house
one
of
her
habits
was
to
get
on
the
outside
and
demand
to
be
let
in
if
she
was
not
waited
upon
immediately
she
would
when
the
door
was
finally
opened
stop
when
halfway
in
and
scold
vigorously
the
tones
of
her
voice
and
the
expression
of
her
face
were
so
exactly
like
those
of
a
scolding
vixenish
woman
that
she
caused
many
a
hearty
laugh
by
her
tirades
thomas
erastus
however
seldom
utters
a
sound
and
at
the
rare
intervals
when
he
condescends
to
purr
he
can
only
be
heard
by
holding
one
ear
close
to
his
great
soft
sides
but
he
has
the
most
remarkable
ways
he
will
open
every
door
in
the
house
from
the
inside
he
will
even
open
blinds
getting
his
paw
under
the
fastening
and
working
patiently
at
it
with
his
body
on
the
blind
itself
until
the
hook
flies
back
and
it
finally
opens
one
housekeeper
trained
him
to
eat
his
meat
close
up
in
one
corner
of
the
kitchen
this
custom
he
kept
up
after
she
went
away
until
new
and
uncommonly
frisky
kittens
annoyed
him
so
that
his
place
was
transferred
to
the
top
of
an
old
table
when
he
got
hungry
in
those
days
however
he
used
to
go
and
crowd
close
up
in
his
corner
and
look
so
pathetically
famished
that
food
was
generally
forthcoming
at
once
thomas
was
formerly
very
much
devoted
to
the
lady
who
lived
next
door
and
was
as
much
at
home
in
her
house
as
in
ours
her
family
rose
an
hour
or
two
earlier
than
ours
in
the
morning
and
their
breakfast
hour
came
first
i
should
attribute
thomas
devotion
to
to
this
fact
since
he
invariably
presented
himself
at
her
window
and
wheedled
her
into
feeding
him
were
it
not
that
his
affection
seemed
just
as
strong
throughout
the
day
it
was
interesting
to
see
him
go
over
and
rattle
her
screen
doors
front
back
or
side
knowing
perfectly
well
that
he
would
bring
some
one
to
open
and
let
him
in
thomas
has
a
really
paternal
air
toward
the
rest
of
the
family
one
spring
night
as
usual
on
retiring
i
went
to
the
back
door
to
call
in
the
cats
thomas
erastus
was
in
my
sister
room
but
none
of
the
others
were
to
be
seen
nor
did
they
come
at
once
evidently
having
strayed
in
their
play
beyond
the
sound
of
my
voice
thomas
upstairs
heard
my
continued
call
and
tried
for
some
time
to
get
out
had
shut
her
door
thinking
to
keep
in
the
one
already
safe
but
the
more
i
called
the
more
persistently
determined
he
became
to
get
out
at
last
opened
her
window
and
let
him
on
to
the
sloping
roof
of
the
l
from
which
he
could
descend
through
a
gnarled
old
apple
tree
meanwhile
i
left
the
back
door
and
went
on
with
my
preparations
for
the
night
about
ten
minutes
later
i
went
and
called
the
cats
again
it
was
a
moonlight
night
and
i
saw
six
delinquent
cats
coming
in
a
flock
across
the
open
field
behind
the
house
all
marshalled
by
thomas
he
evidently
hunted
them
up
and
called
them
in
himself
then
he
sat
on
the
back
porch
and
waited
until
the
last
kit
was
safely
in
before
he
stalked
gravely
in
with
an
air
which
said
as
plainly
as
words
there
it
takes
to
do
anything
with
this
family
none
of
my
cats
would
think
of
responding
to
the
call
of
kitty
kitty
or
puss
puss
they
are
early
taught
their
names
and
answer
to
them
neither
would
one
answer
to
the
name
of
another
except
in
occasional
instances
where
jealousy
prompts
them
to
do
so
we
have
to
be
most
careful
when
we
go
out
of
an
evening
not
to
let
thomas
erastus
get
out
at
the
same
time
in
case
he
does
he
will
follow
us
either
to
the
railroad
station
or
to
the
electric
cars
and
wait
in
some
nook
until
we
come
back
i
have
known
him
to
sit
out
from
seven
until
midnight
of
a
cold
snowy
winter
evening
awaiting
our
return
from
the
theatre
when
we
alight
from
the
cars
he
is
nowhere
to
be
seen
but
before
we
have
gone
many
steps
lo
thomas
erastus
is
behind
or
beside
us
proudly
escorting
his
mistresses
home
but
looking
neither
at
them
nor
to
the
right
or
left
not
until
he
reaches
the
porch
does
he
allow
himself
to
be
petted
but
on
our
way
to
the
cars
his
attitude
is
different
he
is
as
frisky
as
a
kitten
in
vain
do
we
try
to
shoo
him
back
or
catch
him
he
prances
along
just
out
of
reach
but
tantalizingly
close
when
we
get
aboard
our
car
we
know
he
is
safe
in
some
corner
gazing
sadly
after
us
and
that
no
danger
can
drive
him
home
until
we
reappear
both
thomas
and
pompanita
take
a
deep
interest
in
all
household
affairs
although
in
this
respect
they
do
not
begin
to
show
the
curiosity
of
the
pretty
lady
never
a
piece
of
furniture
was
changed
in
he
house
that
she
did
not
immediately
notice
the
first
time
she
came
into
the
room
afterward
and
she
invariably
jumped
up
on
the
article
and
thoroughly
investigated
affairs
before
settling
down
again
every
parcel
that
came
in
must
be
examined
and
afterward
she
must
lie
on
the
paper
or
inside
the
box
that
it
came
in
always
doing
this
with
great
solemnity
and
gazing
earnestly
out
of
her
large
intelligent
dark
eyes
toward
the
close
of
her
life
she
was
greatly
troubled
at
any
unusual
stir
in
the
household
she
liked
to
have
company
but
nothing
disturbed
her
more
than
to
have
a
man
working
in
the
cellar
putting
in
coal
cutting
wood
or
doing
such
work
she
used
then
to
follow
us
uneasily
about
and
look
earnestly
up
into
our
faces
as
if
to
say
girls
this
is
not
right
everything
is
all
upset
here
and
the
world
gang
agley
why
do
you
fix
it
she
was
the
politest
creature
too
that
was
the
reason
of
her
name
in
her
youth
she
was
christened
pansy
then
cleopatra
susan
lady
jane
grey
and
the
duchess
but
her
manners
were
so
punctiliously
perfect
and
she
was
such
a
pretty
lady
always
and
everywhere
moreover
she
had
such
a
habit
of
sitting
with
her
hands
folded
politely
across
her
gentle
bosom
that
the
only
sobriquet
that
ever
clung
was
the
one
that
expressed
herself
the
most
perfectly
she
was
in
every
sense
a
pretty
lady
for
years
she
ate
with
us
at
the
table
her
chair
was
placed
next
to
mine
and
no
matter
where
she
was
or
how
soundly
she
had
been
sleeping
when
the
dinner
bell
rang
she
was
the
first
to
get
to
her
seat
then
she
sat
patiently
until
i
fixed
a
dainty
meal
in
a
saucer
and
placed
it
in
the
chair
beside
her
when
she
ate
it
in
the
same
way
she
did
everything
thomas
erastus
hurt
his
foot
one
day
rather
he
got
it
hurt
during
a
matutinal
combat
at
which
he
was
forced
being
the
head
of
the
family
to
be
present
although
he
is
far
above
the
midnight
carousals
of
his
kind
thomas
erastus
sometimes
loves
to
consider
himself
an
invalid
when
his
doting
mistress
was
not
looking
he
managed
to
step
off
on
that
foot
quite
lively
especially
if
his
mortal
enemy
a
disreputable
black
tramp
skulked
across
the
yard
but
let
thomas
erastus
see
a
feminine
eye
gazing
anxiously
at
him
through
an
open
window
and
he
immediately
hobbled
on
three
legs
then
he
would
stop
and
sit
down
and
assume
so
pathetic
an
expression
of
patient
suffering
that
the
mistress
heart
would
melt
and
thomas
erastus
would
find
himself
being
borne
into
the
house
and
placed
on
the
softest
sofa
once
she
caught
him
down
cellar
there
is
a
window
to
which
he
has
easy
access
and
where
he
can
go
in
and
out
a
hundred
times
a
day
evidently
he
had
planned
to
do
so
at
that
moment
but
seeing
his
fond
mistress
he
sat
down
on
the
cellar
floor
and
with
his
most
fetching
expression
gazed
wistfully
back
and
forth
from
her
to
the
window
and
of
course
she
picked
him
up
carefully
and
put
him
on
the
window
ledge
thomas
erastus
has
all
the
innocent
guile
of
a
successful
politician
he
could
manage
things
slicker
than
the
political
bosses
an
he
would
one
summer
thomas
erastus
moved
an
event
of
considerable
importance
in
his
placid
existence
he
had
to
travel
a
short
distance
on
the
and
worse
he
needs
must
endure
the
indignity
of
travelling
that
distance
in
a
covered
basket
but
his
dignity
would
not
suffer
him
to
do
more
than
send
forth
one
or
two
mournful
wails
of
protest
after
being
kept
in
his
new
house
for
a
couple
of
days
he
was
allowed
to
go
out
and
become
familiar
with
his
surroundings
not
without
fear
and
trepidation
on
the
part
of
his
doting
mistress
that
he
might
make
a
bold
strike
for
his
former
home
but
thomas
erastus
felt
he
had
a
mission
to
perform
for
his
race
he
would
disprove
that
mistaken
theory
that
a
cat
no
matter
how
kindly
he
is
treated
cares
more
for
places
than
for
people
consequently
he
would
not
dream
of
going
back
to
his
old
haunts
no
he
sat
down
in
the
front
yard
and
took
a
long
look
at
his
surroundings
the
neighboring
lots
a
field
of
grass
a
waving
he
had
already
convinced
himself
that
the
new
house
was
home
because
in
it
were
all
the
old
familiar
things
and
he
had
been
allowed
to
investigate
every
bit
of
it
and
to
realize
what
had
happened
so
after
looking
well
about
him
he
made
a
series
of
tours
of
investigation
first
he
took
a
for
the
farthest
end
of
the
nearest
vacant
lot
then
he
chose
the
then
the
beautiful
broad
grounds
of
the
neighbor
below
then
across
the
street
but
between
each
of
these
little
journeys
he
took
a
back
to
his
sat
down
in
front
of
the
new
house
and
got
his
bearings
just
as
evidently
as
though
he
could
have
said
out
loud
this
is
my
home
and
i
must
lose
it
in
this
way
he
convinced
himself
that
where
he
lives
is
the
centre
of
the
universe
and
that
the
world
revolves
around
him
and
he
has
since
been
as
happy
as
a
cricket
yea
happier
for
death
and
destruction
await
the
unfortunate
cricket
where
thomas
erastus
thrives
but
do
say
a
cat
ca
or
wo
be
moved

your
own
fault

every

her

one
or
more

four

haunted

a
sleepy
snowy
creature
like
some
ostrich
plume
a
satanic
thing
with
fiery
eyes
that
to
chipperley
perception
were
informed
with
the
very
bottomless
flames
another
like
a
golden
fleece
caressing
half
human
and
a
little
imp
whose
bounds
and
springs
and
feathery
not
only
did
infinite
damage
among
the
venetian
and
dresden
but
among
chipperley
nerves
in
her
beautiful
home
at
newburyport
she
has
two
beloved
cats
but
i
will
not
attempt
to
improve
on
her
own
account
of
them
as
for
my
own
cats
their
name
has
been
legion
although
a
few
remain
preeminent
there
was
miss
spot
who
came
to
us
already
named
preferring
our
domicile
to
the
neighboring
one
she
had
her
only
son
was
so
black
that
he
was
known
as
ink
spot
but
her
only
daughter
was
so
altogether
ideal
and
black
too
that
she
was
known
as
beauty
spot
beauty
spot
led
a
sorrowful
life
and
was
fortunately
born
clothed
in
black
or
her
mourning
would
have
been
expensive
as
she
was
always
in
a
bereaved
condition
her
drowned
offspring
making
a
shoal
in
the
merrimac
although
she
had
always
plenty
left
she
solaced
herself
with
music
she
would
never
sit
in
any
one
lap
but
mine
and
in
mine
only
when
i
sang
and
then
only
when
i
sang
last
rose
of
summer
this
is
really
true
but
she
would
spring
into
my
husband
lap
if
he
whistled
she
would
leave
her
sleep
reluctantly
start
a
little
way
and
retreat
start
and
retreat
again
and
then
give
one
bound
and
light
on
his
knee
or
his
arm
and
reach
up
one
paw
and
push
it
repeatedly
across
his
mouth
like
one
playing
the
i
suppose
to
get
at
the
sound
she
always
went
to
walk
with
us
and
followed
us
wherever
we
went
about
the
island
lucifer
and
phosphor
have
been
our
cats
for
the
last
ten
years
lucifer
entirely
black
phosphor
as
yellow
as
saffron
a
real
golden
fleece
my
sister
lived
in
town
and
going
away
for
the
summer
left
her
cat
in
a
neighbor
care
and
the
neighbor
moved
away
meanwhile
and
left
the
cat
to
shift
for
herself
she
went
down
to
the
apothecary
two
blocks
away
or
more
there
she
had
a
family
of
kittens
but
apparently
came
up
to
reconnoitre
for
on
my
sister
return
she
appeared
with
one
kitten
and
laid
it
down
at
kate
feet
ran
off
and
in
time
came
with
another
which
she
left
also
and
so
on
until
she
had
brought
up
the
whole
household
lucifer
was
one
of
them
he
was
as
black
as
an
imp
and
as
mischievous
as
one
his
bounds
have
always
been
tremendous
from
the
floor
to
the
high
mantel
or
to
the
top
of
a
tall
buffet
close
under
the
ceiling
and
these
bounds
of
his
together
with
a
way
he
has
of
gazing
into
space
with
his
soulful
and
enormous
yellow
eyes
have
led
to
a
thousand
tales
as
to
his
nightly
journeyings
among
the
stars
hurting
his
foot
slumping
through
the
nebula
in
andromeda
getting
his
supper
at
a
place
in
the
milky
way
hunting
all
night
with
orion
and
having
awful
fights
with
sirius
he
got
his
throat
cut
by
alighting
on
the
north
pole
one
night
coming
down
from
the
stars
the
reason
he
slumps
through
the
nebula
is
on
account
of
his
big
feet
he
has
six
toes
like
the
foot
in
george
augustus
drawing
and
when
he
walks
on
the
top
of
the
piazza
you
would
think
it
was
a
burglar
lucifer
mephistophelian
aspect
is
increased
not
only
by
those
feet
but
by
an
tail
he
sucks
his
tail
alas
and
alas
in
vain
have
we
peppered
it
and
it
and
dipped
it
in
worcestershire
sauce
and
in
aloes
and
done
it
up
in
curl
papers
and
glued
on
it
the
fingers
of
old
gloves
at
last
we
gave
it
up
in
despair
and
i
took
him
and
put
his
tail
in
his
mouth
and
told
him
to
take
his
pleasure
and
that
is
the
reason
i
suppose
that
he
attaches
himself
particularly
to
me
he
is
very
with
those
magnificent
orbs
for
he
will
jump
into
any
one
lap
who
wears
a
black
gown
but
jump
down
instantly
and
when
he
finds
my
lap
curl
down
for
a
brief
season
but
he
is
not
much
of
a
cat
he
puts
up
his
nose
and
smells
my
face
all
over
in
what
he
means
for
a
caress
and
is
off
he
is
not
a
large
eater
although
he
has
been
known
to
help
himself
to
a
whole
steak
at
the
table
being
alone
in
the
dining
room
and
when
poultry
are
in
the
larder
he
is
insistent
till
satisfied
but
he
wants
his
breakfast
early
if
the
second
girl
whose
charge
he
is
does
not
rise
in
season
he
mounts
two
flights
of
stairs
and
seats
himself
on
her
chest
until
she
does
rise
then
if
she
does
not
wait
on
him
at
once
he
goes
into
the
and
springs
to
the
top
of
the
upright
piano
and
deliberately
knocks
off
the
particularly
loving
to
encounter
and
floor
a
brass
dragon
candlestick
then
he
springs
to
the
if
he
has
not
been
seized
and
appeased
and
repeats
operations
and
has
even
carried
his
work
of
destruction
around
the
room
to
the
top
of
a
low
bookcase
and
has
proved
himself
altogether
the
wrong
sort
of
person
in
a
however
it
is
conceded
in
the
family
that
phosphor
is
not
a
cat
merely
he
is
a
person
and
lucifer
is
a
spirit
lucifer
seldom
purrs
i
wonder
if
that
is
a
characteristic
of
black
cats
no
my
black
cats
fairly
roar
a
little
thread
of
sound
and
only
now
and
then
when
very
happy
and
loving
a
rich
full
strain
but
phosphor
purrs
like
a
windmill
like
an
electric
car
like
a
like
a
whole
boiled
dinner
when
phosphor
came
lucifer
six
weeks
her
senior
excellencies
always
incline
one
to
say
of
him
thought
the
little
live
yellow
ball
was
made
only
for
him
to
play
with
and
he
cuffed
and
tossed
him
around
for
all
he
was
worth
licked
him
all
over
twenty
times
a
day
and
slept
with
his
arms
about
him
during
those
early
years
phosphor
never
washed
himself
lucifer
took
such
care
of
him
and
they
were
a
lovely
sight
in
each
other
arms
asleep
but
of
late
years
a
coolness
has
intervened
and
now
they
never
speak
as
they
pass
by
they
sometimes
go
fishing
together
lucifer
walking
off
majestically
alone
always
dark
mysterious
reticent
intent
on
his
own
affairs
making
you
feel
that
he
has
a
sort
of
lofty
contempt
for
yours
sometimes
the
mice
depositing
a
dead
fish
in
the
crannies
of
the
rocks
lucifer
appears
with
it
in
the
twilight
gleaming
in
his
jaws
and
the
great
eyes
gleaming
like
above
it
phosphor
is
however
a
mighty
hunter
mice
rats
by
the
score
chipmunks
all
is
game
that
comes
to
his
net
he
has
cleaned
out
whole
colonies
of
catbirds
for
their
insolence
and
eaten
every
golden
robin
on
the
island
it
used
to
be
very
pretty
to
see
them
when
they
were
little
as
el
mahdi
the
peacock
spread
his
great
tail
dart
and
spring
upon
it
and
go
whirling
round
with
it
as
el
mahdi
fairly
frantic
with
the
little
demons
that
had
hold
of
him
went
skipping
and
springing
round
and
round
but
although
so
fierce
a
fighter
so
inhospitable
to
every
other
cat
phosphor
is
the
most
affectionate
little
soul
he
is
still
very
playful
though
so
large
and
last
summer
to
see
him
bounding
on
the
grass
playing
with
his
tail
turning
somersaults
all
by
himself
was
quite
worth
while
when
we
first
happened
to
go
away
in
his
early
years
he
would
speak
to
us
when
we
came
back
he
felt
so
neglected
i
went
away
for
five
months
once
before
lucifer
was
more
than
a
year
old
he
got
into
no
one
lap
while
i
was
gone
but
the
moment
i
sat
down
on
my
return
he
jumped
into
mine
saluted
me
and
curled
himself
down
for
a
nap
showing
the
plainest
recognition
now
when
one
comes
back
phosphor
is
wild
with
joy
always
in
a
way
he
will
get
into
your
arms
and
on
your
shoulder
and
rub
his
face
around
and
before
you
know
it
his
little
mouth
is
in
the
middle
of
your
mouth
as
much
like
a
kiss
as
anything
can
be
perhaps
it
is
so
well
bred
but
his
motions
are
so
quick
and
perfect
it
seems
so
when
you
let
him
in
he
curls
into
heaps
of
joy
and
fairly
stands
on
his
head
sometimes
he
is
the
most
responsive
creature
always
ready
for
a
caress
and
his
wild
great
amber
eyes
beam
love
if
ever
love
had
manifestation
his
beauty
is
really
extraordinary
his
tail
a
real
wonder
lucifer
i
grieve
to
say
looks
very
phosphor
wore
a
bell
for
a
short
time
once
a
little
rock
bell
but
he
left
it
to
toll
all
winter
in
a
tall
tree
near
the
window
a
charm
of
cats
is
that
they
seem
to
live
in
a
world
of
their
own
just
as
much
as
if
it
were
a
real
dimension
of
space
and
speaking
of
a
fourth
dimension
i
am
living
in
the
expectation
that
the
new
discoveries
in
the
matter
of
radiant
energy
will
presently
be
revealing
to
all
our
senses
the
fact
that
there
is
no
death
we
had
some
barn
kittens
once
that
lived
in
the
ate
with
the
hens
and
quarrelled
with
them
for
any
tidbit
they
curled
up
in
the
egg
boxes
and
did
move
when
the
hens
came
to
lay
and
evidently
had
no
idea
that
they
were
not
hens
oh
there
is
no
end
to
the
cat
situation
it
began
with
the
old
fellow
who
put
his
hand
under
the
cat
to
lift
her
up
and
she
arched
her
back
higher
and
higher
until
he
found
it
was
the
serpent
asgard
and
it
end
with
you
and
me
i
do
know
but
she
the
serpent
asgard
i
do
know
if
you
have
hypnotized
or
magnetized
me
but
i
am
writing
as
if
i
had
known
you
intimately
all
my
life
and
feel
as
though
i
had
it
is
the
freemasonry
of
cats
i
always
said
they
were
possessed
of
spirits
and
they
use
white
magic
to
bring
their
friends
together
spofford
barn
kittens
bring
to
mind
an
incident
related
by
wood
the
beautiful
wife
of
professor
wood
of
the
harvard
medical
school
at
their
summer
place
on
buzzard
bay
she
has
fifteen
cats
mostly
angoras
persians
and
coons
with
several
dogs
these
cats
follow
her
all
about
the
place
in
a
regular
troop
and
a
very
handsome
troop
they
are
with
their
waving
plumy
tails
tipped
gracefully
over
at
the
ends
as
if
saluting
their
superior
officer
among
the
dogs
is
a
spaniel
named
gyp
that
is
particularly
friendly
with
the
cats
there
are
plenty
of
hens
on
the
farm
and
one
spring
a
couple
of
bantams
were
added
to
the
stock
the
cats
immediately
took
a
great
fancy
to
these
diminutive
bipeds
and
watched
them
with
the
greatest
interest
finally
the
little
hen
had
a
flock
of
chickens
as
the
weather
was
still
cold
the
farmer
put
them
upstairs
in
one
of
the
barns
and
every
day
gyp
would
take
seven
or
eight
of
those
cats
up
there
to
see
the
fluffy
little
things
dog
and
cats
would
seat
themselves
around
the
bantam
and
her
brood
and
watch
them
by
the
hour
never
offering
to
touch
the
chickens
except
when
the
little
things
were
tired
and
went
for
a
nap
under
their
mother
wings
and
then
some
cat
first
one
and
then
another
would
softly
poke
its
paw
under
the
hen
and
stir
up
the
family
making
them
all
run
out
in
consternation
and
keeping
things
lively
once
more
the
cats
did
dream
of
catching
the
chickens
only
wanting
evidently
that
they
should
emulate
joey
and
keep
moving
on
a
writer
in
the
tells
of
a
favorite
bantam
hen
with
which
the
house
cat
has
long
been
accustomed
to
play
this
bantam
has
increased
and
multiplied
and
keeps
her
family
in
a
coop
on
the
ground
into
which
rats
easily
enter
at
bedtime
however
pussy
takes
up
her
residence
there
and
bantam
the
brood
of
chickens
and
pussy
sleep
in
happy
harmony
nightly
if
any
rats
arrive
their
experience
must
be
sad
and
sharp
another
writer
in
the
same
number
tells
of
a
cat
in
huddersfield
england
belonging
to
canon
beardsley
who
helps
himself
to
a
reel
of
cotton
from
the
takes
it
on
the
floor
and
plays
with
it
as
long
as
he
likes
and
then
jumps
up
and
puts
the
reel
back
in
its
place
again
just
as
our
bobinette
used
to
get
his
although
the
latter
never
was
known
to
put
it
away
miss
sarah
orne
jewett
is
a
too
and
the
dear
old
countrywomen
down
in
maine
with
whom
one
gets
acquainted
through
her
books
usually
keep
a
cat
also
says
she
i
look
back
over
so
long
a
line
of
family
cats
from
a
certain
poor
spotty
who
died
an
awful
death
in
a
fit
on
the
flagstones
under
the
library
window
when
i
was
less
than
five
years
old
to
a
lawless
fluffy
yellow
and
white
coon
cat
now
in
my
possession
that
i
find
it
hard
to
single
out
the
most
interesting
pussy
of
all
i
shall
have
to
speak
of
two
cats
at
least
one
being
the
enemy
and
the
other
the
friend
of
my
dog
joe
joe
and
i
grew
up
together
and
were
fond
companions
until
he
died
of
far
too
early
old
age
and
left
me
to
take
my
country
walks
alone
polly
the
enemy
was
the
best
mouser
of
all
quite
the
best
business
cat
we
ever
had
with
an
astonishing
intellect
and
a
shrewd
way
of
gaining
her
ends
she
caught
birds
and
mice
as
if
she
foraged
for
our
whole
family
she
had
an
air
of
responsibility
and
a
certain
impatience
of
interruption
and
interference
such
as
i
have
never
seen
in
any
other
cat
and
a
scornful
way
of
sitting
before
a
person
with
fierce
eyes
and
a
quick
ominous
twitching
of
her
tail
she
seemed
to
be
measuring
incompetence
as
a
in
these
moments
or
to
be
saying
to
herself
a
clumsy
stupid
person
how
little
she
knows
and
how
i
should
like
to
scratch
her
and
hear
her
squeak
i
sometimes
felt
as
if
i
were
a
larger
sort
of
helpless
mouse
in
these
moments
but
sometimes
polly
would
be
more
friendly
and
even
jump
into
our
laps
when
it
was
a
pleasure
to
pat
her
hard
little
head
with
its
exquisitely
soft
dark
fur
no
matter
if
she
almost
always
turned
and
caught
the
caressing
hand
with
teeth
and
claws
when
she
was
tired
of
its
touch
you
would
always
be
ready
to
pat
her
next
time
there
was
such
a
fascination
about
her
that
any
attention
on
her
part
gave
a
thrill
of
pride
and
pleasure
every
guest
and
stranger
admired
her
and
tried
to
win
her
favor
while
we
of
the
household
hid
our
wounds
and
delighted
in
her
cleverness
and
beauty
polly
was
but
a
small
cat
to
have
a
mind
she
looked
quite
round
and
kittenish
as
she
sat
before
the
fire
in
a
rare
moment
of
leisure
with
her
black
paws
tucked
under
her
white
breast
and
her
sleek
back
looking
as
if
it
caught
flickers
of
firelight
in
some
yellow
streaks
among
the
shiny
black
fur
but
when
she
walked
abroad
she
stretched
out
long
and
thin
like
a
little
tiger
and
held
her
head
high
to
look
over
the
grass
as
if
she
were
threading
the
jungle
she
lashed
her
tail
to
and
fro
and
one
turned
out
of
her
way
instantly
you
opened
a
door
for
her
if
she
crossed
the
room
and
gave
you
a
look
she
made
you
know
what
she
meant
as
if
she
had
the
gift
of
speech
at
most
inconvenient
moments
you
would
go
out
through
the
house
to
find
her
a
bit
of
fish
or
to
open
the
cellar
door
you
recognized
her
right
to
appear
at
night
on
your
bed
with
one
of
her
kittens
which
she
had
brought
in
the
rain
out
of
a
cellar
window
and
up
a
lofty
ladder
over
the
wet
steep
roofs
and
down
through
a
scuttle
into
the
garret
and
still
down
into
warm
shelter
here
she
would
leave
it
and
with
one
or
two
loud
admonishing
purrs
would
scurry
away
upon
some
errand
that
must
have
been
like
one
of
the
border
frays
of
old
she
used
to
treat
joe
the
dog
with
sad
cruelty
giving
him
a
sharp
blow
on
his
honest
nose
that
made
him
meekly
stand
back
and
see
her
add
his
supper
to
her
own
a
child
visitor
once
rightly
complained
that
polly
had
pins
in
her
toes
and
nobody
knew
this
better
than
poor
joe
at
last
in
despair
he
sought
revenge
i
was
writing
at
my
desk
one
day
when
he
suddenly
appeared
grinning
in
a
funny
way
he
had
and
wagging
his
tail
until
he
enticed
me
out
to
the
kitchen
there
i
found
polly
who
had
an
air
of
calling
everything
in
the
house
her
own
she
was
on
the
cook
table
gobbling
away
at
some
chickens
which
were
being
made
ready
for
the
oven
and
had
been
left
unguarded
i
caught
her
and
cuffed
her
and
she
fled
through
the
garden
door
for
once
tamed
and
vanquished
though
usually
she
was
so
quick
that
nobody
could
administer
justice
upon
these
depredations
of
a
cat
then
i
turned
and
saw
poor
old
joe
dancing
about
the
kitchen
in
perfect
delight
he
had
been
afraid
to
touch
polly
himself
but
he
knew
the
difference
between
right
and
wrong
and
had
called
me
to
see
what
a
wicked
cat
she
was
and
to
give
him
the
joy
of
looking
on
at
the
flogging
it
was
the
same
dog
who
used
sometimes
to
be
found
under
a
table
where
his
master
had
sent
him
for
punishment
in
his
young
days
of
lawless
for
chasing
the
neighbor
chickens
these
faults
had
long
been
overcome
but
sometimes
in
later
years
joe
conscience
would
trouble
him
we
never
knew
why
and
he
would
go
under
the
table
of
his
own
accord
and
look
repentant
and
crestfallen
until
some
forgiving
and
sympathetic
friend
would
think
he
had
suffered
enough
and
bid
him
come
out
to
be
patted
and
consoled
after
such
a
as
polly
joe
had
great
amends
in
our
next
cat
yellow
danny
the
most
amiable
and
friendly
pussy
that
ever
walked
on
four
paws
he
took
danny
to
his
heart
at
once
they
used
to
lie
in
the
sun
together
with
danny
head
on
the
dog
big
paws
and
i
sometimes
used
to
meet
them
walking
as
coy
as
lovers
side
by
side
up
one
of
the
garden
walks
when
i
could
not
help
laughing
at
their
sentimental
and
conscious
air
they
would
turn
aside
into
the
bushes
for
shelter
they
respected
each
other
suppers
and
ate
together
on
the
kitchen
hearth
and
took
great
comfort
in
close
companionship
danny
always
answered
if
you
spoke
to
him
but
he
made
no
sound
while
always
opening
his
mouth
wide
to
mew
whenever
he
had
anything
to
say
and
looking
up
into
your
face
with
all
his
heart
expressed
these
affectations
of
speech
were
most
amusing
especially
in
so
large
a
person
as
yellow
danny
he
was
much
beloved
by
me
and
by
all
his
family
especially
poor
joe
who
must
sometimes
have
had
the
worst
of
dreams
about
old
polly
and
her
sharp
unsparing
claws
miss
mary
wilkins
is
also
a
great
admirer
of
cats
i
adore
cats
she
says
i
do
love
them
as
well
as
dogs
because
my
own
nature
is
more
after
the
lines
of
a
dog
but
i
adore
them
no
matter
how
tired
or
wretched
i
am
a
sitting
in
a
doorway
can
divert
my
mind
cats
love
one
so
much
more
than
they
will
allow
but
they
have
so
much
wisdom
they
keep
it
to
themselves
miss
wilkins
augustus
was
moved
with
her
from
brattleboro
after
her
father
death
and
when
she
went
to
randolph
to
live
he
had
been
the
pet
of
the
family
for
a
long
time
but
he
came
to
an
untimely
end
i
hope
says
miss
wilkins
people
unintentional
cruelty
will
not
be
remembered
against
them
since
living
in
randolph
she
has
had
two
lovely
yellow
and
white
cats
punch
and
judy
the
latter
was
shot
by
a
neighbor
but
punch
the
cat
with
the
angelic
expression
still
survives
i
am
quite
sure
says
his
mistress
he
loves
me
better
than
anybody
else
although
he
is
so
very
close
about
it
punch
wilkins
has
one
accomplishment
he
can
open
a
door
with
an
latch
but
he
can
not
shut
it
louise

is
famous
for
her
love
and
good
comradeship
with
dogs
especially
her
setters
and
bernards
but
she
is
too
thoroughly
a
poet
not
to
be
captivated
by
the
grace
and
beauty
of
a
cat
i
love
the
unsubmissive
race
she
says
and
have
had
much
edification
out
of
the
charming
friendships
between
our
bernards
and
our
cats
annie

the
actress
once
gave
me
two
exquisite
angoras
little
persons
of
character
equal
to
their
looks
but
they
died
young
and
we
have
not
since
had
the
heart
to
replace
them
i
once
had
another
coon
a
small
spry
gray
fellow
named

the
tamest
and
most
endearing
of
pets
always
on
your
shoulder
and
a
that
who
suddenly
on
no
provocation
whatever
turned
wild

for
a
year
or
more
in
the
woods
next
our
garden
hunting
and
fishing
although
ceaselessly
chased
and
called
and
implored
to
revisit
his
afflicted
family
he
associated
sometimes
with
the
neighbor
cat
but
never
never
more
with
humanity
until
finally
we
found
his
pathetic
little
frozen
body
one
christmas
near
the
barn

you

whitney
who
has
written
so
many
helpful
stories
for
girls
is
another
lover
of
cats
cats
do
not
lie
curled
up
on
cushions
everywhere
in
her
books
as
they
do
in
spofford
but
in
zerub
throop
experiment
there
is
an
amusing
cat
story
which
she
declares
got
so
much
mixed
up
with
a
ghost
story
that
nobody
ever
knew
which
was
which
and
the
incident
is
true
in
every
particular
except
the
finding
of
a
will
or
codicil
or
something
at
the
end
which
is
attached
for
purposes
of
fiction
a
great
deal
has
been
written
about
the
new
york
famous
cats
at
my
request
dana
furnished
the
following
description
of
the
interesting
family
i
can
only
vouch
for
its
veracity
by
quoting
the
famous
phrase
if
you
see
it
in
the
it
is
so
office
cat
domestica
var
this
is
a
variation
of
the
common
domestic
cat
of
which
but
one
family
is
known
to
science
the
habitat
of
the
species
is
in
newspaper
row
its
lair
is
in
the
building
its
habits
are
nocturnal
and
it
feeds
on
discarded
copy
and
anything
else
of
a
nature
upon
which
it
can
pounce
in
dull
times
it
can
subsist
upon
a
meagre
diet
of
telegraphic
brevities
police
court
paragraphs
and
city
jottings
but
when
the
universe
is
agog
with
news
it
will
exhibit
the
insatiable
appetite
which
is
its
chief
distinguishing
mark
of
difference
from
the
common
a
single
member
of
this
family
has
been
known
on
a
night
to
devour
three
and
a
half
columns
of
presidential
possibilities
seven
columns
of
general
politics
pretty
much
all
but
the
head
of
a
large
and
railroad
accident
and
a
full
page
of
miscellaneous
news
and
then
claw
the
nether
garments
of
the
managing
editor
and
call
attention
to
an
appetite
still
in
good
working
order
the
progenitrix
of
the
family
arrived
in
the
office
many
years
ago
and
installed
herself
in
a
comfortable
corner
and
within
a
few
short
months
she
had
noticeably
raised
the
literary
tone
of
the
paper
as
well
as
a
large
and
vociferous
family
of
kittens
these
kittens
were
weaned
on
reports
from
country
correspondents
and
the
sight
of
the
six
children
and
the
mother
cat
sitting
in
a
semicircle
was
one
which
attracted
visitors
from
all
parts
of
the
nation
just
before
her
death
immediately
before
in
fact
the
mother
cat
developed
a
literary
taste
of
her
own
and
drank
the
contents
of
an
she
was
buried
with
literary
honors
and
one
of
her
progeny
was
advanced
to
the
duties
and
honors
of
office
cat
from
this
time
the
line
came
down
each
cat
taking
the
greener
from
the
brows
of
him
that
uttered
nothing
base
upon
the
death
of
his
predecessor
there
is
but
one
blot
upon
the
escutcheon
of
the
family
put
there
by
a
recent
incumbent
who
developed
a
mania
at
once
cannibalistic
and
infanticidal
and
set
about
making
a
free
lunch
of
her
offspring
in
direct
violation
of
the
raines
law
and
the
maternal
instinct
she
died
of
an
overdose
of
chloroform
and
her
place
was
taken
by
one
of
the
rescued
kittens
it
is
the
son
of
this
kitten
who
is
the
present
proud
incumbent
of
the
office
grown
to
he
is
a
creditable
specimen
of
his
family
with
beryl
eyes
beautiful
striped
fur
showing
fine
mottlings
of
mucilage
and
ink
a
graceful
and
aspiring
tail
an
appetite
for
copy
unsurpassed
in
the
annals
of
his
race
and
a
power
and
perseverance
in
vocality
chiefly
exercised
in
the
small
hours
of
the
morning
that
together
with
the
appetite
referred
to
have
earned
for
him
the
name
of
the
mutilator
the
picture
herewith
given
was
taken
when
the
animal
was
a
year
and
a
half
old
up
to
the
age
of
one
year
the
mutilator
made
its
lair
in
the
inside
office
with
the
snake
editor
until
a
tragic
ending
came
to
their
friendship
during
a
fortnight
absence
of
the
office
cat
upon
important
business
the
snake
editor
cultivated
the
friendship
of
three
cockroaches
whom
he
debauched
by
teaching
them
to
drink
beer
spilled
upon
his
desk
for
that
purpose
on
the
night
of
the
return
the
three
bugs
had
become
disgracefully
intoxicated
and
were
reeling
around
the
desk
beating
time
with
their
legs
to
a
rollicking
catch
sung
by
the
snake
editor
before
the
muddled
insects
could
crawl
into
a
crack
the
mutilator
was
upon
them
and
had
bolted
every
one
then
with
a
look
of
reproach
at
the
snake
editor
he
drew
three
perpendicular
red
lines
across
that
gentleman
features
with
his
claws
and
departed
in
high
scorn
nor
could
he
ever
thereafter
be
lured
into
the
inner
office
where
the
was
laying
for
him
with
a
space
measure
since
that
time
he
has
lived
in
the
room
occupied
by
the
reporters
and
news
editors
many
hundreds
of
stories
some
of
them
slanderous
have
been
told
about
the
various
office
cats
but
we
have
admitted
here
none
of
these
false
tales
the
short
sketch
given
here
is
beyond
suspicion
in
all
its
details
as
can
be
vouched

cats
the
nearest
approach
to
the
real
french
salon
in
america
is
said
to
be
found
in
louise
chandler
moulton
boston
in
former
days
at
her
weekly
fridays
sir
richard
coeur
de
lion
was
always
present
sitting
on
the
square
piano
amidst
a
lot
of
other
celebrities
the
autographed
photographs
of
paderewski
john
drew
and
distinguished
litterateurs
however
used
to
lose
nothing
from
the
proximity
of
moulton
favorite
maltese
friend
who
was
on
the
most
intimate
terms
with
her
for
twelve
years
and
hobnobbed
familiarly
with
most
of
the
lions
of
one
sort
or
another
who
have
visited
boston
and
who
invariably
find
their
way
into
this
room
if
there
were
flowers
on
the
piano
richard
nose
hovered
near
them
in
a
perfect
abandon
of
delight
indeed
his
fondness
for
flowers
was
a
source
of
constant
contention
between
him
and
his
mistress
who
feared
lest
he
knock
the
souvenirs
of
foreign
countries
to
the
floor
in
his
eagerness
to
climb
wherever
flowers
were
put
he
was
as
dainty
about
his
eating
as
in
his
taste
for
the
beautiful
scorning
beef
and
mutton
as
fit
only
for
coarser
mortals
and
choosing
like
any
to
eat
only
the
breast
of
chicken
or
certain
portions
of
fish
or
lobster
he
was
not
proof
against
the
flavor
of
liver
at
any
time
but
recognized
in
it
his
one
weakness
as
the
delicate
lady
may
who
takes
snuff
or
chews
gum
on
the
sly
when
moulton
first
had
him
she
had
also
a
little
dog
and
the
two
as
usual
when
a
kitten
is
brought
up
with
a
dog
became
the
greatest
of
friends
that
richard
was
a
close
observer
was
proved
by
the
way
he
used
to
wag
his
tail
in
the
same
fashion
and
apparently
for
the
same
reasons
as
the
dog
this
went
on
for
several
years
but
when
the
dog
died
the
fashion
of
wagging
tails
went
out
so
far
as
richard
coeur
de
lion
was
concerned
he
had
a
fashion
of
getting
up
on
mantels
the
tops
of
bookcases
or
on
shelves
and
his
mistress
fearing
demolition
of
her
household
lares
and
penates
insisted
on
his
getting
down
whereupon
richard
would
look
reproachfully
at
her
apparently
resenting
this
treatment
for
days
afterward
refusing
to
come
near
her
and
edging
off
if
she
tried
to
make
up
with
him
when
richard
was
getting
old
a
black
cat
came
to
moulton
who
kept
him
for
luck
and
named
him
the
black
prince
the
older
cat
was
always
jealous
of
the
newcomer
and
treated
him
with
lofty
scorn
when
he
caught
moulton
petting
the
black
prince
who
is
a
very
affectionate
fellow
richard
fiercely
resented
it
and
sometimes
refused
to
have
anything
to
do
with
her
for
days
afterward
but
finally
came
around
and
made
up
in
shamefaced
fashion
moulton
goes
to
london
usually
in
the
summer
leaving
the
cats
in
the
care
of
a
faithful
maid
whom
she
has
had
for
years
after
she
sailed
richard
used
to
come
to
her
door
for
several
mornings
and
not
being
let
in
as
usual
understood
that
his
beloved
mistress
had
left
him
again
whereupon
he
kept
up
a
prolonged
wailing
for
some
time
he
was
correspondingly
glad
to
see
her
on
her
return
in
october
moulton
tells
the
following
remarkable
cat
story
my
mother
had
a
cat
that
lived
to
be
years
old
he
was
faithful
and
fond
and
a
great
pet
in
the
family
of
course
about
two
years
before
his
death
a
new
kitten
was
added
to
the
family
this
kitten
named
jim
immediately
conceived
the
greatest
affection
for
old
jack
and
as
the
old
fellow
senses
of
sight
and
smell
failed
so
that
he
could
not
go
hunting
himself
jim
used
to
do
it
for
both
every
day
he
brought
jack
mice
and
squirrels
and
other
game
as
long
as
he
lived
then
too
he
used
to
wash
jack
lapping
him
all
over
as
a
mother
cat
does
her
kitten
he
did
this
too
as
long
as
he
lived
the
feebler
old
jack
grew
the
more
jim
did
for
him
and
when
jack
finally
died
of
old
age
jim
was
inconsolable
years
might
certainly
be
termed
a
ripe
old
age
for
a
cat
their
average
life
extending
only
to
ten
or
twelve
years
but
i
have
heard
of
one
who
seems
to
have
attained
even
greater
age
the
mother
of
jane
andrews
the
writer
on
educational
and
juvenile
subjects
had
one
who
lived
with
them
years
he
had
peculiar
markings
and
certain
ways
of
his
own
about
the
house
quite
different
from
other
cats
he
disappeared
one
day
when
he
was
and
was
mourned
as
dead
but
one
day
some
six
or
seven
years
later
an
old
cat
came
to
their
door
and
asked
to
be
let
in
he
had
the
same
markings
and
on
being
let
in
went
directly
to
his
favorite
and
lay
down
he
seemed
perfectly
familiar
with
the
whole
place
and
went
on
with
his
life
from
that
time
just
as
though
he
had
never
been
away
showing
all
his
old
peculiarities
when
he
finally
died
he
must
have
been
years
old
although
in
other
days
a
great
many
noted
men
have
been
devoted
to
cats
i
do
not
find
that
our
men
of
letters
know
so
much
about
cats
william
dean
howells
says
i
never
had
a
cat
pet
or
otherwise
i
like
them
but
know
nothing
of
them
judge
robert
grant
says
my
feelings
toward
cats
are
kindly
and
considerate
but
not
ardent
thomas
bailey
aldrich
says
the
only
cat
i
ever
had
any
experience
with
was
the
one
i
translated
from
the
french
of
émile
de
la
bédolliérre
many
years
ago

the
entertainment
of
my

when
asked
if

says
if

which
were

colonel
thomas
higginson
however
confesses
to
a
great
fondness
for
cats
although
he
has
had
no
remarkable
cats
of
his
own
he
tells
a
story
told
him
by
an
old
sailor
at
pigeon
cove
of
a
cat
which
he
the
sailor
tried
in
vain
to
get
rid
of
after
trying
several
methods
he
finally
put
the
cat
in
a
bag
walked
a
mile
to
lane
cove
tied
the
cat
to
a
big
stone
with
a
firm
sailor
knot
took
it
out
in
a
dory
some
distance
from
the
shore
and
dropped
the
cat
overboard
then
he
went
back
home
to
find
the
cat
purring
on
the
doorstep
those
who
are
familiar
with
charles
dudley
warner
my
summer
in
a
garden
will
not
need
to
be
reminded
of
calvin
and
his
interesting
traits
warner
says
i
never
had
but
one
cat
and
he
was
rather
a
friend
and
companion
than
a
cat
when
he
departed
this
life
i
did
not
care
to
do
as
many
men
do
when
their
partners
die
take
a
the
sketch
of
him
in
that
delightful
book
is
vouched
for
as
correct
edmund
clarence
stedman
too
is
a
genuine
admirer
of
cats
and
evidently
knows
how
to
appreciate
them
at
their
true
value
at
his
home
near
new
york
he
and
stedman
have
one
who
rejoices
in
the
name
babylon
having
originated
in
babylon
long
island
he
is
a
fine
large
maltese
and
attracted
a
great
deal
of
attention
at
the
new
york
cat
show
in
we
look
upon
him
as
an
important
member
of
our
family
says
stedman
and
think
he
knows
as
much
as
any
of
us
he
despises
our
two
other
cats
but
he
is
very
fond
of
human
beings
and
makes
friends
readily
with
strangers
he
is
always
present
at
the
family
dinner
table
at
and
expects
to
have
his
share
handed
to
him
carefully
he
has
a
favorite
corner
in
the
study
and
has
superintended
a
great
deal
of
literary
work
stedman
blue
kelpie
took
a
prize
in
the
show
of
gail
hamilton
was
naturally
a
lover
of
cats
although
in
her
crowded
life
there
was
not
much
time
to
devote
to
them
in
the
last
year
of
her
noble
life
she
wrote
to
a
friend
as
follows
my
two
hands
were
eager
to
lighten
the
of
a
burdened
world
but
the
brush
fell
from
my
hand
now
i
can
only
sit
in
a
nook
of
november
sunshine
playing
with
two
little
black
and
white
kittens
well
i
never
before
had
time
to
play
with
kittens
as
much
as
i
wished
and
when
i
come
outdoors
and
see
them
bounding
toward
me
in
long
light
leaps
i
am
glad
that
they
leap
toward
me
and
not
away
from
me
little
soft
fierce
sparks
of
infinite
energy
holding
a
mystery
of
their
own
as
inscrutable
as
life
and
i
remember
that
with
all
our
high
art
the
common
daily
sun
searches
a
man
for
one
revealing
moment
and
makes
a
truer
portrait
than
the
most
laborious
painter
the
divine
face
of
our
saviour
reflected
in
the
pure
and
noble
traits
of
humanity
will
not
fail
from
the
earth
because
my
hand
has
failed
in
cunning
one
would
expect
a
poet
of
ella
wheeler
wilcox
temperament
to
be
passionately
fond
of
cats
just
as
she
is
one
would
expect
too
that
only
the
most
beautiful
and
luxurious
of
persians
and
angoras
would
satisfy
her
demand
for
a
pet
this
is
also
justifiable
as
she
has
several
magnificent
cats
about
whom
she
has
published
a
number
of
interesting
stories
her
madame
ref
is
quite
a
noted
cat
but
wilcox
favorite
and
the
handsomest
of
all
is
named
banjo
a
gorgeous
chinchilla
and
white
angora
with
a
silken
coat
that
almost
touches
the
floor
and
a
ruff
or
lord
mayor
chain
that
is
a
finger
wide
his
father
was
ajax
his
mother
was
madame
ref
and
wilcox
raised
him
she
has
taught
him
many
cunning
tricks
he
will
sit
up
like
a
bear
and
when
his
mistress
says
hug
me
banjo
he
puts
both
white
paws
around
her
neck
and
hugs
her
tight
then
she
says
turn
the
other
cheek
and
he
turns
his
furry
chops
for
her
to
kiss
he
also
plays
dead
and
rolls
over
at
command
he
too
is
fond
of
literary
work
and
superintends
his
mistress
writing
from
a
drawer
of
her
desk
goody
is
another
of
wilcox
pets
and
has
one
blue
and
one
topaz
eye
who
has
not
read
agnes
repplier
fascinating
essays
on
agrippina
and
a
kitten
i
can
not
quite
believe
she
gives
cats
credit
for
the
capacity
for
affection
which
they
really
possess
but
her
description
of
agrippina
is
charming
agrippina
beautifully
ringed
tail
flapping
across
my
copy
distracts
my
attention
and
imperils
the
neatness
of
my
penmanship
even
when
she
is
disposed
to
be
affable
turns
the
light
of
her
countenance
upon
me
watches
with
attentive
curiosity
every
stroke
i
make
and
softly
with
curved
paw
pats
my
pen
as
it
travels
over
the
paper
even
in
these
halcyon
moments
though
my
is
flattered
by
her
condescension
i
am
aware
that
i
should
work
better
and
more
rapidly
if
i
denied
myself
this
charming
companionship
but
in
truth
it
is
impossible
for
a
lover
of
cats
to
banish
these
alert
gentle
and
discriminating
little
friends
who
give
us
just
enough
of
their
regard
and
complaisance
to
make
us
hunger
for
more
fee
the
naturalist
who
has
written
so
admirably
about
animals
and
who
understands
as
only
a
frenchman
can
understand
the
delicate
and
subtle
organization
of
a
cat
frankly
admits
that
the
keynote
of
its
character
is
independence
it
dwells
under
our
roofs
sleeps
by
our
fire
endures
our
blandishments
and
apparently
enjoys
our
society
without
for
one
moment
forfeiting
its
sense
of
absolute
freedom
without
acknowledging
any
servile
relation
to
the
human
creature
who
shelters
it
rude
and
masterful
souls
resent
this
fine
in
a
domestic
animal
and
require
that
it
shall
have
no
will
but
theirs
no
pleasure
that
does
not
emanate
from
them
yet
there
are
people
less
magisterial
perhaps
or
less
exacting
who
believe
that
true
friendship
even
with
an
animal
may
be
built
up
on
mutual
esteem
and
independence
that
to
demand
gratitude
is
to
be
unworthy
of
it
and
that
obedience
is
not
essential
to
agreeable
and
healthy
intercourse
a
man
who
owns
a
dog
is
in
every
sense
of
the
word
its
master
the
term
expresses
accurately
their
mutual
relations
but
it
is
ridiculous
when
applied
to
the
limited
possession
of
a
cat
i
am
certainly
not
agrippina
mistress
and
the
assumption
of
authority
on
my
part
would
be
a
mere
empty
dignity
like
those
swelling
titles
which
afford
such
innocent
delight
to
the
freemasons
of
our
severe
republic
how
many
times
have
i
rested
tired
eyes
on
her
graceful
little
body
curled
up
in
a
ball
and
wrapped
round
with
her
tail
like
a
parcel
or
stretched
out
luxuriously
on
my
bed
one
paw
coyly
covering
her
face
the
other
curved
gently
inwards
as
though
clasping
an
invisible
treasure
asleep
or
awake
in
rest
or
in
motion
grave
or
gay
agrippina
is
always
beautiful
and
it
is
better
to
be
beautiful
than
to
fetch
and
carry
from
the
rising
to
the
setting
of
the
sun
but
when
agrippina
has
breakfasted
and
washed
and
sits
in
the
sunlight
blinking
at
me
with
affectionate
contempt
i
feel
soothed
by
her
absolute
and
unqualified
enjoyment
i
know
how
full
my
day
will
be
of
things
that
i
do
want
particularly
to
do
and
that
are
not
particularly
worth
doing
but
for
her
time
and
the
world
hold
only
this
brief
moment
of
contentment
slowly
the
eyes
close
gently
the
little
body
is
relaxed
oh
you
who
strive
to
relieve
your
overwrought
nerves
and
cultivate
power
through
repose
watch
the
exquisite
languor
of
a
drowsy
cat
and
despair
of
imitating
such
perfect
and
restful
grace
there
is
a
gradual
yielding
of
every
muscle
to
the
soft
persuasiveness
of
slumber
the
flexible
frame
is
curved
into
tender
lines
the
head
nestles
lower
the
paws
are
tucked
out
of
sight
no
convulsive
throb
or
start
betrays
a
rebellious
alertness
only
a
faint
quiver
of
unconscious
satisfaction
a
faint
heaving
of
the
tawny
sides
a
faint
gleam
of
the
yellow
eyes
and
agrippina
is
asleep
i
look
at
her
for
one
wistful
moment
and
then
turn
resolutely
to
my
work
it
were
ignoble
to
wish
myself
in
her
place
and
yet
how
charming
to
be
able
to
settle
down
to
a
nap
peur
et
sans
at
ten
in
the
morning
and
again
when
i
am
told
that
agrippina
is
disobedient
ungrateful
perverse
stupid
treacherous
and
cruel
i
no
longer
strive
to
check
the
torrent
of
abuse
i
know
that
buffon
said
all
this
and
much
more
about
cats
and
that
people
have
gone
on
repeating
it
ever
since
principally
because
these
spirited
little
beasts
have
remained
just
what
it
pleased
providence
to
make
them
have
preserved
their
primitive
freedom
through
centuries
of
effete
and
demoralizing
civilization
why
i
wonder
should
a
great
many
good
men
and
women
cherish
an
unreasonable
grudge
against
one
animal
because
it
does
not
chance
to
possess
the
precise
qualities
of
another
dog
fetches
my
slippers
for
me
every
night
said
a
friend
triumphantly
not
long
ago
puts
them
first
to
warm
by
the
fire
and
then
brings
them
over
to
my
chair
wagging
his
tail
and
as
proud
as
punch
would
your
cat
do
as
much
for
you
i
like
to
know
assuredly
not
if
i
waited
for
agrippina
to
fetch
me
shoes
or
slippers
i
should
have
no
other
resource
save
to
join
as
speedily
as
possible
one
of
the
barefooted
religious
orders
of
italy
but
after
all
fetching
slippers
is
not
the
whole
duty
of
domestic
pets
as
for
curiosity
that
vice
which
the
abbé
galiani
held
to
be
unknown
to
animals
but
which
the
more
astute
voltaire
detected
in
every
little
dog
that
he
saw
peering
out
of
the
window
of
its
master
coach
it
is
the
ruling
passion
of
the
feline
breast
a
closet
door
left
ajar
a
box
with
lid
an
open
bureau
drawer
these
are
the
objects
that
fill
a
cat
with
the
liveliest
interest
and
delight
agrippina
watches
breathlessly
the
unfastening
of
a
parcel
and
tries
to
hasten
matters
by
clutching
actively
at
the
string
when
its
contents
are
shown
to
her
she
examines
them
gravely
and
then
with
a
sigh
of
relief
settles
down
to
repose
the
slightest
noise
disturbs
and
irritates
her
until
she
discovers
its
cause
if
she
hears
a
footstep
in
the
hall
she
runs
out
to
see
whose
it
is
and
like
certain
troublesome
little
people
i
have
known
she
dearly
loves
to
go
to
the
front
door
every
time
the
bell
is
rung
from
my
window
she
surveys
the
street
with
tranquil
scrutiny
and
if
the
boys
are
playing
below
she
follows
their
games
with
a
steady
scornful
stare
very
different
from
the
wistful
eagerness
of
a
friendly
dog
quivering
to
join
in
the
sport
sometimes
the
boys
catch
sight
of
her
and
shout
up
rudely
at
her
window
and
i
can
never
sufficiently
admire
agrippina
conduct
upon
these
trying
occasions
the
composure
with
which
she
affects
neither
to
see
nor
to
hear
them
nor
to
be
aware
that
there
are
such
objectionable
creatures
as
children
in
the
world
sometimes
too
the
terrier
that
lives
next
door
comes
out
to
sun
himself
in
the
street
and
beholding
my
cat
sitting
well
out
of
reach
he
dances
madly
up
and
down
the
pavement
barking
with
all
his
might
and
rearing
himself
on
his
short
legs
in
a
futile
attempt
to
dislodge
her
then
the
spirit
of
evil
enters
agrippina
little
heart
the
window
is
open
and
she
creeps
to
the
extreme
edge
of
the
stone
sill
stretches
herself
at
full
length
peers
down
smilingly
at
the
frenzied
dog
dangles
one
paw
enticingly
in
the
air
and
exerts
herself
with
quiet
malice
to
drive
him
to
desperation
her
sense
of
humor
is
awakened
by
his
frantic
efforts
and
by
her
own
absolute
security
and
not
until
he
is
spent
with
exertion
and
lies
panting
and
exhausted
on
the
bricks
does
she
arch
her
graceful
back
stretch
her
limbs
lazily
in
the
sun
and
with
one
light
bound
spring
from
the
window
to
my
desk
and
what
more
delightful
word
did
ever
miss
repplier
write
than
her
description
of
a
kitten
it
she
says
is
the
most
irresistible
comedian
in
the
world
its
eyes
gleam
with
wonder
and
mirth
it
darts
madly
at
nothing
at
all
and
then
as
though
suddenly
checked
in
the
pursuit
prances
sideways
on
its
hind
legs
with
ridiculous
agility
and
zeal
it
makes
a
vast
pretence
of
climbing
the
rounds
of
a
chair
and
swings
by
the
curtains
like
an
acrobat
it
scrambles
up
a
table
leg
and
is
seized
with
comic
horror
at
finding
itself
full
two
feet
from
the
floor
if
you
hasten
to
its
rescue
it
clutches
you
nervously
its
little
heart
thumping
against
its
furry
sides
while
its
soft
paws
expand
and
contract
with
agitation
and
relief
all
their
harmless
claws
disclose
like
prickles
of
an
early
rose
yet
the
instant
it
is
back
on
the
carpet
it
feigns
to
be
suspicious
of
your
interference
peers
at
you
out
of
tail
o
its
and
scampers
for
protection
under
the
sofa
from
which
asylum
it
presently
emerges
with
cautious
trailing
steps
as
though
encompassed
by
fearful
dangers
and
alarms
nobody
can
sympathize
with
her
in
the
following
description
better
than
i
who
for
years
was
compelled
by
the
insistence
of
my
pretty
lady
to
aid
in
the
bringing
up
of
infants
i
own
that
when
agrippina
brought
her
son
aged
two
days
and
established
him
in
my
bedroom
closet
the
plan
struck
me
at
the
start
as
inconvenient
i
had
prepared
another
nursery
for
the
little
claudius
nero
and
i
endeavored
for
a
while
to
convince
his
mother
that
my
arrangements
were
best
but
agrippina
was
inflexible
the
closet
suited
her
in
every
respect
and
with
charming
and
irresistible
flattery
she
gave
me
to
understand
in
the
mute
language
i
knew
so
well
that
she
wished
her
baby
boy
to
be
under
my
immediate
protection
bring
him
to
you
because
i
trust
you
she
said
as
plainly
as
looks
can
speak
they
handle
him
all
the
time
and
it
is
not
good
for
kittens
to
be
handled
here
he
is
safe
from
harm
and
here
he
shall
remain
after
a
few
weak
remonstrances
the
futility
of
which
i
too
clearly
understood
her
persistence
carried
the
day
i
removed
my
clothing
from
the
closet
spread
a
shawl
upon
the
floor
had
the
door
taken
from
its
hinges
and
resigned
myself
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
to
the
daily
and
hourly
companionship
of
an
infant
i
was
amply
rewarded
people
who
require
the
household
cat
to
rear
her
offspring
in
some
remote
attic
or
dark
corner
of
the
cellar
have
no
idea
of
all
the
diversion
and
pleasure
that
they
lose
it
is
delightful
to
watch
the
little
blind
sprawling
feeble
helpless
things
develop
swiftly
into
the
grace
and
agility
of
kittenhood
it
is
delightful
to
see
the
mingled
pride
and
anxiety
of
the
mother
whose
parental
love
increases
with
every
hour
of
care
and
who
exhibits
her
young
family
as
if
they
were
infant
gracchi
the
hope
of
all
their
race
during
extreme
youth
there
were
times
when
agrippina
wearied
both
of
his
companionship
and
of
her
own
maternal
duties
once
or
twice
she
abandoned
him
at
night
for
the
greater
luxury
of
my
bed
where
she
slept
tranquilly
by
my
side
unmindful
of
the
little
wailing
cries
with
which
nero
lamented
her
desertion
once
or
twice
the
heat
of
early
summer
tempted
her
to
spend
the
evening
on
the
porch
roof
which
lay
beneath
my
windows
and
i
have
passed
some
anxious
hours
awaiting
her
return
and
wondering
what
would
happen
if
she
never
came
back
and
i
were
left
to
bring
up
the
baby
by
hand
but
as
the
days
sped
on
and
nero
grew
rapidly
in
beauty
and
intelligence
agrippina
affection
for
him
knew
no
bounds
she
could
hardly
bear
to
leave
him
even
for
a
little
while
and
always
came
hurrying
back
to
him
with
a
loud
frightened
mew
as
if
fearing
he
might
have
been
stolen
in
her
absence
at
night
she
purred
over
him
for
hours
or
made
little
gurgling
noises
expressive
of
ineffable
content
she
resented
the
careless
curiosity
of
strangers
and
was
a
trifle
supercilious
when
the
cook
stole
softly
in
to
give
vent
to
her
fervent
admiration
but
from
first
to
last
she
shared
with
me
her
pride
and
pleasure
and
the
joy
in
her
beautiful
eyes
as
she
raised
them
to
mine
was
frankly
confiding
and
sympathetic
when
the
infant
claudius
rolled
for
the
first
time
over
the
ledge
of
the
closet
and
lay
sprawling
on
the
bedroom
floor
it
would
have
been
hard
to
say
which
of
us
was
the
more
elated
at
his
prowess
what
became
of
these
most
interesting
cats
is
only
hinted
at
miss
repplier
sincere
grief
at
their
loss
is
evident
in
the
following
every
night
they
retired
at
the
same
time
and
slept
upon
the
same
cushion
curled
up
inextricably
into
one
soft
furry
ball
many
times
i
have
knelt
by
their
chair
to
bid
them
both
good
night
and
always
when
i
did
so
agrippina
would
lift
her
charming
head
purr
drowsily
for
a
few
seconds
and
then
nestle
closer
still
to
her
with
sighs
of
supreme
satisfaction
the
zenith
of
her
life
had
been
reached
her
cup
of
contentment
was
full
it
is
a
rude
world
even
for
little
cats
and
evil
chances
lie
in
wait
for
the
petted
creatures
we
strive
to
shield
from
harm
remembering
the
pangs
of
separation
the
possibilities
of
unkindness
or
neglect
the
troubles
that
hide
in
ambush
on
every
unturned
page
i
am
sometimes
glad
that
the
same
cruel
and
selfish
blow
struck
both
mother
and
son
and
that
they
lie
together
safe
from
hurt
or
hazard
sleeping
tranquilly
and
always
under
the
shadow
of
the
friendly
pines
probably
no
modern
cat
has
been
more
written
about
than
miss
mary
booth
muff
there
was
a
tippet
but
he
was
early
lost
miss
booth
as
the
editor
of
was
the
centre
of
a
large
circle
of
literary
and
musical
people
her
saturday
evenings
were
to
new
york
what
moulton
fridays
are
to
boston
the
nearest
approach
to
the
french
salon
possible
in
america
at
these
saturday
evenings
muff
always
figured
prominently
being
dressed
in
a
real
lace
collar
brought
him
from
yucatan
by
madame
la
plongeon
and
elaborate
and
expensive
enough
for
the
most
fastidious
lady
and
apparently
enjoying
the
company
of
noted
intellectual
people
as
well
as
the
best
of
them
and
who
knows
if
he
had
spoken
what
light
he
might
have
shed
on
what
seemed
to
mere
mortals
as
mysterious
abstruse
and
occult
problems
perhaps
after
all
he
liked
that
salon
because
in
reality
he
found
so
much
to
amuse
him
in
the
conversation
and
perhaps
he
was
under
that
guise
of
friendly
interest
in
noted
scientists
reformers
poets
musicians
and
litterateurs
only
whispering
to
himself
o
lord
what
fools
these
mortals
be
for
when
i
play
with
my
cat
says
montaigne
how
do
i
know
whether
she
does
not
make
a
jest
of
me
but
muff
was
a
real
nobleman
among
cats
and
extraordinarily
handsome
he
was
a
great
soft
gray
maltese
with
white
paws
and
breast
mild
amiable
and
uncommonly
intelligent
he
felt
it
his
duty
to
help
entertain
miss
booth
guests
always
and
he
more
than
once
at
the
beginning
of
a
reception
came
into
the
with
a
mouse
in
his
mouth
as
his
offering
to
the
occasion
naturally
enough
he
caused
the
stampede
as
spofford
puts
it
that
gilbert
forgot
to
put
into
ida
when
her
amazons
wild
demonstrate
their
courage
as
one
of
miss
booth
intimate
friends
spofford
was
much
at
her
house
and
became
early
a
devoted
admirer
of
muff
his
latter
days
she
says
were
rendered
miserable
by
a
little
silky
gray
creature
an
angora
named
vashti
who
was
a
spark
of
the
fire
of
the
lower
regions
wrapped
round
in
long
silky
fur
and
who
never
let
him
alone
one
moment
who
was
full
of
and
racings
and
leapings
and
fury
and
of
the
most
demonstrative
love
for
her
mistress
once
i
made
them
collars
with
breastplates
of
tiny
dangling
bells
nine
or
ten
it
excited
them
nearly
to
madness
and
they
flew
up
and
down
stairs
like
unchained
lightning
till
the
trinkets
were
taken
off
in
a
house
full
of
birds
muff
never
touched
one
although
he
was
an
excellent
mouser
who
says
cats
have
no
conscience
he
was
although
so
socially
inclined
toward
his
mistress
guests
a
timid
person
and
the
wild
cats
filled
him
with
terror
but
as
one
must
see
something
of
the
world
continues
spofford
he
used
to
jump
from
lintel
to
lintel
of
the
windows
of
the
block
if
by
chance
his
own
were
left
open
and
return
when
he
pleased
muff
died
soon
after
the
death
of
miss
booth
vashti
who
was
very
much
admired
by
all
her
mistress
literary
friends
was
given
to
miss
juliet
corson
miss
edna
dean
proctor
the
poet
is
another
admirer
of
fine
cats
her
favorite
however
was
the
friend
of
her
childhood
called
beauty
beauty
was
my
grandmother
cat
says
miss
proctor
and
the
delight
of
my
childhood
to
this
day
i
remember
her
as
distinctly
as
i
do
my
aunt
and
cousins
of
that
household
and
even
my
dear
grandmother
herself
i
know
nothing
of
her
ancestry
and
am
not
at
all
sure
that
she
was
royally
bred
for
she
came
one
chill
night
a
little
wanderer
to
the
door
but
a
shred
of
blue
ribbon
was
clinging
to
her
neck
and
she
was
so
pretty
and
silky
and
winsome
that
we
children
at
once
called
her
beauty
and
fancied
she
had
strayed
from
some
elegant
home
where
she
had
been
the
pet
of
the
household
lapping
her
milk
from
finest
china
and
sleeping
on
a
cushion
of
down
when
we
had
warmed
and
fed
and
caressed
her
we
made
her
bed
in
a
box
among
our
dolls
and
the
next
morning
were
up
before
the
sun
to
see
her
fearing
her
owners
would
appear
and
carry
her
away
but
no
one
arrived
to
claim
her
and
she
soon
became
an
important
member
of
the
family
and
grew
handsomer
we
thought
day
by
day
her
coat
was
gray
with
tiger
markings
but
paws
and
throat
and
nose
were
snowy
white
and
in
spite
of
her
excursions
to
barns
and
cellars
her
constant
care
kept
them
spotless
indeed
she
was
the
very
venus
of
cats
for
daintiness
and
grace
of
pose
and
movement
to
my
grandmother
her
various
attitudes
had
an
undoubted
meaning
if
in
a
rainy
day
beauty
washed
her
face
toward
the
west
her
observant
mistress
would
exclaim
kitty
is
washing
her
face
to
the
west
it
will
clear
or
even
when
the
sky
was
blue
if
beauty
turned
eastward
for
her
toilet
the
comment
would
be
is
washing
her
face
to
the
east
the
wind
must
be
getting
out
from
the
sea
and
a
storm
brewing
and
when
in
the
dusk
of
autumn
or
winter
evenings
beauty
ran
about
the
room
chasing
her
tail
or
frolicking
with
her
kittens
instead
of
sleeping
quietly
by
the
fire
as
was
her
wont
my
grandmother
would
look
up
and
say
is
wild
the
wind
will
blow
hard
before
morning
if
i
sometimes
asked
how
she
knew
these
things
the
reply
would
be
mother
told
me
when
i
was
a
little
girl
now
her
mother
my
was
a
distinguished
personage
in
my
eyes
having
been
the
daughter
of
captain
jonathan
prescott
who
commanded
a
company
under
sir
william
pepperell
at
the
siege
of
louisburg
and
lost
his
life
there
and
i
could
not
question
the
wisdom
of
colonial
times
indeed
to
this
hour
i
have
a
lingering
belief
that
cats
can
foretell
the
weather
and
what
a
mouser
she
was
before
her
time
we
often
heard
the
rats
and
mice
in
the
walls
but
with
her
presence
not
one
dared
to
peep
and
cupboard
and
pantry
were
unmolested
now
and
then
she
carried
her
forays
to
hedge
and
orchard
and
i
remember
one
sad
summer
twilight
that
saw
her
bring
in
a
slender
brown
bird
which
my
grandmother
said
was
the
cuckoo
we
had
delighted
to
hear
in
the
still
mornings
among
the
alders
by
the
river
she
was
scolded
and
had
no
milk
that
night
and
we
never
knew
her
to
catch
a
bird
again
o
to
see
her
with
her
kittens
she
always
hid
them
in
the
haymows
and
hunting
and
finding
them
brought
us
no
end
of
excitement
and
pleasure
twice
a
day
at
least
she
would
come
to
the
house
to
be
fed
and
then
how
we
watched
her
returning
steps
stealing
cautiously
along
the
path
and
waiting
behind
stack
or
door
the
better
to
observe
her
for
pussy
knew
perfectly
well
that
we
were
eager
to
see
her
darlings
and
enjoyed
misleading
and
piquing
us
we
imagined
by
taking
devious
ways
how
well
i
recall
that
summer
afternoon
when
and
alone
i
followed
her
to
the
floor
of
the
barn
just
as
she
was
about
to
spring
to
the
mow
she
espied
me
and
turning
back
cunningly
settled
herself
as
if
for
a
quiet
nap
in
the
sunny
open
door
determined
not
to
lose
sight
of
her
i
threw
myself
upon
the
fragrant
hay
but
in
the
stillness
the
faint
sighing
of
the
wind
the
ripple
of
the
river
the
hazy
outline
of
the
hills
the
wheeling
swallows
overhead
were
blended
at
length
in
an
indistinct
dream
and
i
slept
oblivious
of
all
when
i
woke
pussy
had
disappeared
the
sun
was
setting
the
cows
were
coming
from
the
pastures
and
i
could
only
return
to
the
house
discomfited
that
particular
family
of
kittens
we
never
saw
till
a
fortnight
later
when
the
proud
mother
brought
them
in
one
by
one
and
laid
them
at
my
grandmother
feet
what
became
of
beauty
is
as
mysterious
as
the
fate
of
the
dauphin
to
our
grief
she
disappeared
one
november
day
and
we
never
saw
her
more
sometimes
we
fancied
she
had
been
carried
off
by
an
admiring
traveller
at
others
we
tortured
ourselves
with
the
belief
that
the
traditional
wildcat
of
the
north
woods
had
devoured
her
all
we
knew
was
that
she
had
vanished
but
when
memory
pictures
that
pleasant
country
home
and
the
dear
circle
there
beauty
is
always
sleeping
by
the
fire
miss
fidelia
bridges
the
artist
is
another
devoted
cat
lover
and
at
her
home
at
canaan
has
had
several
interesting
specimens
among
my
many
generations
of
pet
cats
says
miss
bridges
one
aristocratic
maltese
lady
stands
out
in
prominence
before
all
the
rest
she
was
a
cat
of
great
personal
beauty
and
independence
of
character
a
remarkable
huntress
bringing
in
game
almost
as
large
as
herself
holding
her
beautiful
head
aloft
to
keep
the
great
wings
of
pigeons
from
trailing
on
the
ground
she
and
her
mother
were
fast
friends
from
birth
to
death
when
the
young
maltese
had
her
first
brood
of
kittens
her
mother
had
also
a
family
in
another
barrel
in
the
cellar
when
we
went
to
see
the
family
we
found
our
lady
malty
bed
empty
and
there
in
her
mother
barrel
were
both
families
and
both
mothers
a
delightful
arrangement
for
the
young
mother
who
could
leave
her
children
in
the
grandmother
care
and
enjoy
her
liberty
when
it
pleased
her
to
roam
abroad
the
young
lady
had
an
indomitable
will
and
when
she
decided
to
do
a
thing
nothing
would
turn
her
aside
she
found
a
favorite
on
a
pile
of
blankets
in
a
dark
attic
room
this
being
disapproved
of
by
the
elders
the
door
was
kept
carefully
closed
she
then
found
entrance
through
a
hole
high
up
on
the
wall
of
an
adjoining
room
a
cover
was
hung
over
the
hole
she
sprang
up
and
knocked
it
off
then
as
a
last
resort
the
hole
was
papered
over
like
the
of
the
room
she
looked
made
a
leap
and
crashed
through
the
paper
with
as
merry
an
air
as
a
through
his
papered
hoop
she
had
a
habit
of
manoeuvring
to
be
shut
out
of
doors
at
and
then
when
all
was
still
climbing
up
to
my
window
by
means
of
a
porch
over
a
door
beneath
it
to
pass
the
night
on
my
bed
in
some
alterations
of
the
house
the
porch
was
taken
away
she
looked
with
dismay
for
a
moment
at
the
destruction
of
her
ladder
then
calmly
ran
up
the
side
of
the
house
to
my
window
which
she
always
after
continued
to
do
next
in
importance
perhaps
is
my
present
intimate
companion
now
ten
years
old
and
absolutely
deaf
so
that
we
communicate
with
signs
if
i
want
to
attract
his
attention
i
step
on
the
floor
if
to
go
to
his
dinner
i
show
him
a
certain
blue
plate
to
call
him
in
at
night
i
take
a
lantern
outside
the
door
and
the
flash
of
light
attracts
his
attention
from
a
great
distance
on
one
occasion
he
lived
nine
months
alone
in
the
house
while
i
made
a
trip
to
europe
absolutely
refusing
all
the
neighbors
invitations
to
enter
any
other
house
a
gardener
brought
him
his
daily
rations
as
warm
weather
came
he
spent
his
days
in
the
fields
returning
in
the
night
for
his
food
so
that
at
my
return
it
was
two
or
three
days
before
he
discovered
that
the
house
was
open
the
third
evening
he
entered
the
open
door
looked
wildly
about
for
a
moment
but
when
i
put
my
hand
on
him
suddenly
recognized
me
and
overwhelmed
me
with
affectionate
caresses
and
for
two
days
and
nights
would
not
allow
me
out
of
his
sight
unable
to
eat
or
sleep
unless
i
was
close
at
hand
and
following
me
from
room
to
room
and
chair
to
chair
and
people
say
that
cats
have
no
affection
at
the
quincy
house
in
boston
may
be
seen
in
the
office
an
oil
painting
of
an
immense
yellow
cat
the
first
time
i
noticed
the
picture
i
was
proceeding
into
the
dining
room
and
while
waiting
for
dinner
was
amused
at
seeing
the
original
of
the
picture
walk
sedately
in
all
alone
and
going
to
an
empty
table
seat
himself
with
majestic
grace
in
a
chair
the
waiter
seeing
him
came
forward
and
pushed
up
the
chair
as
he
would
do
for
any
other
guest
the
cat
then
waited
patiently
without
putting
his
paws
on
the
table
or
violating
any
other
law
of
table
etiquette
until
a
plate
of
meat
came
cut
up
to
suit
his
taste
i
did
not
hear
him
give
his
order
and
then
placing
his
front
paws
on
the
edge
of
the
table
he
ate
from
his
plate
when
he
had
finished
he
descended
from
his
table
and
stalked
out
of
the
room
with
much
dignity
he
was
always
regular
at
his
meals
and
although
he
picked
out
a
good
seat
did
not
always
sit
at
the
same
table
he
was
in
appearance
something
like
the
famous
orange
cats
of
venice
and
attracted
much
attention
as
might
be
expected
up
to
his
death
at
a
ripe
old
age
miss
frances
willard
was
a
too
and
had
a
beautiful
cat
which
is
known
to
all
her
friends
tootsie
went
to
rest
cottage
the
home
of
frances
willard
when
only
a
kitten
and
there
he
lived
the
pet
of
the
household
and
its
guests
until
several
years
ago
when
miss
willard
prepared
to
go
abroad
then
she
took
tootsie
in
her
arms
carried
him
to
the
drexel
kennels
in
chicago
and
asked
their
owner
leland
norton
to
admit
him
as
a
member
of
her
large
cat
family
where
he
still
lives
to
his
praise
be
it
spoken
he
has
never
forgotten
his
old
friends
at
rest
cottage
to
this
day
whenever
any
of
them
come
to
call
upon
him
he
honors
them
with
instant
and
hearty
recognition
miss
willard
was
sometimes
forced
to
be
separated
from
him
more
than
a
year
at
a
time
but
neither
time
nor
change
had
any
effect
upon
tootsie
at
the
first
sound
of
her
voice
he
would
spring
to
her
side
he
is
a
magnificent
angora
weighing
pounds
with
the
long
silky
hair
the
frill
or
lord
mayor
chain
the
superb
curling
tail
and
the
large
full
eyes
of
the
thoroughbred
then
he
has
proved
himself
of
aristocratic
tendencies
has
beautiful
manners
is
endowed
with
the
human
qualities
of
memory
and
discrimination
and
is
aesthetic
in
his
tastes
being
the
privileged
character
that
he
is
tootsie
always
eats
at
the
table
with
the
family
he
has
his
own
chair
and
bib
and
his
manners
are
said
to
be
exquisite
chapter
v
concerning
some
historic
cats
it
is
quite
common
for
writers
on
the
cat
to
say
the
story
of
théophile
gautier
cats
is
too
familiar
to
need
comment
on
the
contrary
i
do
not
believe
it
is
familiar
to
the
average
reader
and
that
only
those
who
know
gautier
ménagerie
in
the
original
recall
the
particulars
of
his
white
and
black
dynasties
for
this
reason
they
shall
be
repeated
in
these
pages
i
use
translation
partly
in
a
selfish
desire
to
save
myself
time
and
labor
but
principally
because
she
has
preserved
so
successfully
the
sympathetic
and
appreciative
spirit
of
gautier
himself
dynasties
of
cats
as
numerous
as
those
of
the
egyptian
kings
succeeded
each
other
in
my
dwelling
says
he
one
after
another
they
were
swept
away
by
accident
by
flight
by
death
all
were
loved
and
regretted
but
life
is
made
up
of
oblivion
and
the
memory
of
cats
dies
out
like
the
memory
of
men
after
making
mention
of
an
old
gray
cat
who
always
took
his
part
against
his
parents
and
used
to
bite
madame
gautier
legs
when
she
presumed
to
reprove
her
son
he
passes
on
at
once
to
the
romantic
period
and
the
commemoration
of
childebrand
this
name
at
once
reveals
a
deep
design
of
flouting
boileau
whom
i
did
not
like
then
but
have
since
become
reconciled
to
has
not
nicholas
said
le
plaisant
projet
poëte
ignorant
que
de
tant
de
héros
va
choisir
childebrant
now
i
considered
childebrand
a
very
fine
name
indeed
merovingian
mediaeval
and
gothic
and
vastly
preferable
to
agamemnon
achilles
ulysses
or
any
greek
name
whatsoever
romanticism
was
the
fashion
of
my
early
days
i
have
no
doubt
the
people
of
classical
times
called
their
cats
hector
ajax
or
patroclus
childebrand
was
a
splendid
cat
of
common
kind
tawny
and
striped
with
black
like
the
hose
of
saltabadil
in
rois
amuse
with
his
large
green
eyes
and
his
symmetrical
stripes
there
was
something
tigerlike
about
him
that
pleased
me
childebrand
had
the
honor
of
figuring
in
some
verses
that
i
wrote
to
boileau
puis
je
te
décrirai
ce
tableau
de
rembrandt
que
me
fait
tant
plaisir

plus
clair
childebrand
was
brought
in
there
to
make
a
good
rhyme
for
rembrandt
the
piece
being
a
kind
of
confession
of
the
romantic
faith
made
to
a
friend
who
was
then
as
enthusiastic
as
myself
about
victor
hugo
sainte
beuve
and
alfred
de
musset
i
come
next
to
madame
théophile
a
cat
with
a
white
breast
a
pink
nose
and
blue
eyes
whom
i
called
by
that
name
because
we
were
on
terms
of
the
closest
intimacy
she
slept
at
the
foot
of
my
bed
she
sat
on
the
arm
of
my
chair
while
i
wrote
she
came
down
into
the
garden
and
gravely
walked
about
with
me
she
was
present
at
all
my
meals
and
frequently
intercepted
a
choice
morsel
on
its
way
from
my
plate
to
my
mouth
one
day
a
friend
who
was
going
away
for
a
short
time
brought
me
his
parrot
to
be
taken
care
of
during
his
absence
the
bird
finding
itself
in
a
strange
place
climbed
up
to
the
top
of
its
perch
by
the
aid
of
its
beak
and
rolled
its
eyes
as
yellow
as
the
nails
in
my
in
a
rather
frightened
manner
also
moving
the
white
membranes
that
formed
its
eyelids
madame
théophile
had
never
seen
a
parrot
and
she
regarded
the
creature
with
manifest
surprise
while
remaining
as
motionless
as
a
cat
mummy
from
egypt
in
its
swathing
bands
she
fixed
her
eyes
upon
the
bird
with
a
look
of
profound
meditation
summoning
up
all
the
notions
of
natural
history
that
she
had
picked
up
in
the
yard
in
the
garden
and
on
the
roof
the
shadow
of
her
thoughts
passed
over
her
changing
eyes
and
we
could
plainly
read
in
them
the
conclusion
to
which
her
scrutiny
led
this
is
a
green
chicken
this
result
attained
the
next
proceeding
of
madame
théophile
was
to
jump
off
the
table
from
which
she
had
made
her
observations
and
lay
herself
flat
on
the
ground
in
a
corner
of
the
room
exactly
in
the
attitude
of
the
panther
in
gérôme
picture
watching
the
gazelles
as
they
come
down
to
drink
at
a
lake
the
parrot
followed
the
movements
of
the
cat
with
feverish
anxiety
it
ruffled
its
feathers
rattled
its
chain
lifted
one
of
its
feet
and
shook
the
claws
and
rubbed
its
beak
against
the
edge
of
its
trough
instinct
told
it
that
the
cat
was
an
enemy
and
meant
mischief
the
cat
eyes
were
now
fixed
upon
the
bird
with
fascinating
intensity
and
they
said
in
perfectly
intelligible
language
which
the
poor
parrot
distinctly
understood
chicken
ought
to
be
good
to
eat
although
it
is
green
we
watched
the
scene
with
great
interest
ready
to
interfere
at
need
madame
théophile
was
creeping
nearer
and
nearer
almost
imperceptibly
her
pink
nose
quivered
her
eyes
were
half
closed
her
contractile
claws
moved
in
and
out
of
their
velvet
sheaths
slight
thrills
of
pleasure
ran
along
her
backbone
at
the
idea
of
the
meal
she
was
about
to
make
such
novel
and
exotic
food
excited
her
appetite
all
in
an
instant
her
back
took
the
shape
of
a
bent
bow
and
with
a
vigorous
and
elastic
bound
she
sprang
upon
the
perch
the
parrot
seeing
its
danger
said
in
a
bass
voice
as
grave
and
deep
as
own
tu
déjeuné
jacquot
this
utterance
so
terrified
the
cat
that
she
sprang
backwards
the
blare
of
a
trumpet
the
crash
and
smash
of
a
pile
of
plates
flung
to
the
ground
a
pistol
shot
fired
off
at
her
ear
could
not
have
frightened
her
more
thoroughly
all
her
ornithological
ideas
were
overthrown
de
quoi
du
rôti
du
roi
continued
the
parrot
then
might
we
the
observers
read
in
the
physiognomy
of
madame
théophile
is
not
a
bird
it
is
a
gentleman
it
talks
bu
du
vin
clairet
tout
tourne
tout
tourne
an
cabaret
shrieked
the
parrot
in
a
deafening
voice
for
it
had
perceived
that
its
best
means
of
defence
was
the
terror
aroused
by
its
speech
the
cat
cast
a
glance
at
me
which
was
full
of
questioning
but
as
my
response
was
not
satisfactory
she
promptly
hid
herself
under
the
bed
and
from
that
refuge
she
could
not
be
induced
to
stir
during
the
whole
of
the
day
people
who
are
not
accustomed
to
live
with
animals
and
who
like
descartes
regard
them
as
mere
machines
will
think
that
i
lend
unauthorized
meanings
to
the
acts
of
the
and
the
but
i
have
only
faithfully
translated
their
ideas
into
human
language
the
next
day
madame
théophile
plucked
up
courage
and
made
another
attempt
which
was
similarly
repulsed
from
that
moment
she
gave
it
up
accepting
the
bird
as
a
variety
of
man
this
dainty
and
charming
animal
was
extremely
fond
of
perfumes
especially
of
patchouli
and
the
scent
exhaled
by
india
shawls
she
was
also
very
fond
of
music
and
would
listen
sitting
on
a
pile
of
while
the
fair
singers
who
came
to
try
the
critic
piano
filled
his
room
with
melody
all
the
time
madame
théophile
would
evince
great
pleasure
she
was
however
made
nervous
by
certain
notes
and
at
the
high
she
would
tap
the
singer
mouth
with
her
paw
this
was
very
amusing
and
my
visitors
delighted
in
making
the
experiment
it
never
failed
the
dilettante
in
fun
was
not
to
be
deceived
the
rule
of
the
dynasty
belonged
to
a
later
epoch
and
was
inaugurated
in
the
person
of
a
pretty
little
kitten
as
white
as
a
powder
puff
who
came
from
havana
on
account
of
his
spotless
whiteness
he
was
called
pierrot
but
when
he
grew
up
this
name
was
very
properly
magnified
into
which
was
far
more
majestic
and
suggested
théophile
gautier
lays
it
down
as
a
dogma
that
all
animals
with
whom
one
is
much
taken
up
and
who
are
become
delightfully
good
and
amiable
successfully
supported
his
master
theory
perhaps
he
suggested
it
he
shared
in
the
life
of
the
household
with
the
enjoyment
of
quiet
fireside
friendship
that
is
characteristic
of
cats
he
had
his
own
place
near
the
fire
and
there
he
would
sit
with
a
convincing
air
of
comprehension
of
all
that
was
talked
of
and
of
interest
in
it
he
followed
the
looks
of
the
speakers
and
uttered
little
sounds
toward
them
as
though
he
too
had
objections
to
make
and
opinions
to
give
upon
the
literary
subjects
which
were
most
frequently
discussed
he
was
very
fond
of
books
and
when
he
found
one
open
on
a
table
he
would
lie
down
on
it
turn
over
the
edges
of
the
leaves
with
his
paws
and
after
a
while
fall
asleep
for
all
the
world
as
if
he
had
been
reading
a
fashionable
novel
he
was
deeply
interested
in
my
writing
too
the
moment
i
took
up
my
pen
he
would
jump
upon
the
desk
and
follow
the
movement
of
the
penholder
with
the
gravest
attention
making
a
little
movement
with
his
head
at
the
beginning
of
each
line
sometimes
he
would
try
to
take
the
pen
out
of
my
hand
never
went
to
bed
until
i
had
come
in
he
would
wait
for
me
just
inside
the
outer
door
and
rub
himself
to
my
legs
his
back
in
an
arch
with
a
glad
and
friendly
purring
then
he
would
go
on
before
me
preceding
me
with
a
air
and
i
have
no
doubt
if
i
had
asked
him
he
would
have
carried
the
candlestick
having
thus
conducted
me
to
my
bedroom
he
would
wait
quietly
while
i
undressed
and
then
jump
on
my
bed
take
my
neck
between
his
paws
gently
rub
my
nose
with
his
own
and
lick
me
with
his
small
pink
tongue
as
rough
as
a
file
uttering
all
the
time
little
inarticulate
cries
which
expressed
as
clearly
as
any
words
could
do
his
perfect
satisfaction
at
having
me
with
him
again
after
these
caresses
he
would
perch
himself
on
the
back
of
the
bedstead
and
sleep
there
carefully
balanced
like
a
bird
on
a
branch
when
i
awoke
he
would
come
down
and
lie
beside
me
until
i
got
up
pierrot
was
as
strict
as
a
concierge
in
his
notions
of
the
proper
hour
for
all
good
people
to
return
to
their
homes
he
did
not
approve
of
anything
later
than
midnight
in
those
days
we
had
a
little
society
among
friends
which
we
called
four
candles
the
light
in
our
place
of
meeting
being
restricted
to
four
candles
in
silver
candlesticks
placed
at
the
four
corners
of
the
tables
sometimes
the
talk
became
so
animated
that
i
forgot
all
about
time
and
twice
or
three
times
pierrot
sat
up
for
me
until
two
in
the
morning
after
a
while
however
my
conduct
in
this
respect
displeased
him
and
he
retired
to
rest
without
me
i
was
touched
by
this
mute
protest
against
my
innocent
dissipation
and
thenceforth
came
home
regularly
at
twelve
nevertheless
pierrot
cherished
the
memory
of
my
offence
for
some
time
he
waited
to
test
the
reality
of
my
repentance
but
when
he
was
convinced
that
my
conversion
was
sincere
he
deigned
to
restore
me
to
his
good
graces
and
resumed
his
nocturnal
post
in
the
anteroom
to
gain
the
friendship
of
a
cat
is
a
difficult
thing
the
cat
is
a
philosophical
methodical
quiet
animal
tenacious
of
its
own
habits
fond
of
order
and
cleanliness
and
it
does
not
lightly
confer
its
friendship
if
you
are
worthy
of
its
affection
a
cat
will
be
your
friend
but
never
your
slave
he
keeps
his
free
will
though
he
loves
and
he
will
not
do
for
you
what
he
thinks
unreasonable
but
if
he
once
gives
himself
to
you
it
is
with
such
absolute
confidence
such
fidelity
of
affection
he
makes
himself
the
companion
of
your
hours
of
solitude
melancholy
and
toil
he
remains
for
whole
evenings
on
your
knee
uttering
his
contented
purr
happy
to
be
with
you
and
forsaking
the
company
of
animals
of
his
own
species
in
vain
do
melodious
mewings
on
the
roof
invite
him
to
one
of
those
cat
parties
in
which
fish
bones
play
the
part
of
tea
and
cakes
he
is
not
to
be
tempted
away
from
you
put
him
down
and
he
will
jump
up
again
with
a
sort
of
cooing
sound
that
is
like
a
gentle
reproach
and
sometimes
he
will
sit
upon
the
carpet
in
front
of
you
looking
at
you
with
eyes
so
melting
so
caressing
and
so
human
that
they
almost
frighten
you
for
it
is
impossible
to
believe
that
a
soul
is
not
there
had
a
sweetheart
of
the
same
race
and
of
as
snowy
a
whiteness
as
himself
the
ermine
would
have
looked
yellow
by
the
side
of
seraphita
for
so
this
lovely
creature
was
named
in
honor
of
balzac
swedenborgian
romance
seraphita
was
of
a
dreamy
and
contemplative
disposition
she
would
sit
on
a
cushion
for
hours
together
quite
motionless
not
asleep
and
following
with
her
eyes
in
a
rapture
of
attention
sights
invisible
to
mere
mortals
caresses
were
agreeable
to
her
but
she
returned
them
in
a
very
reserved
manner
and
only
in
the
case
of
persons
whom
she
favored
with
her
rarely
accorded
esteem
she
was
fond
of
luxury
and
it
was
always
upon
the
handsomest
or
the
rug
that
would
best
show
off
her
snowy
fur
that
she
would
surely
be
found
she
devoted
a
great
deal
of
time
to
her
toilet
her
glossy
coat
was
carefully
smoothed
every
morning
she
washed
herself
with
her
paw
and
licked
every
atom
of
her
fur
with
her
pink
tongue
until
it
shone
like
new
silver
when
any
one
touched
her
she
instantly
effaced
all
trace
of
the
contact
she
could
not
endure
to
be
tumbled
an
idea
of
aristocracy
was
suggested
by
her
elegance
and
distinction
and
among
her
own
people
she
was
a
duchess
at
least
she
delighted
in
perfumes
would
stick
her
nose
into
bouquets
bite
scented
handkerchiefs
with
little
spasms
of
pleasure
and
walk
about
among
the
scent
bottles
on
the
toilet
table
smelling
at
their
stoppers
no
doubt
she
would
have
used
the
powder
puff
if
she
had
been
permitted
such
was
seraphita
and
never
did
cat
more
amply
justify
a
poetic
name
i
must
mention
here
that
in
the
days
of
the
white
dynasty
i
was
also
the
happy
possessor
of
a
family
of
white
rats
and
that
the
cats
always
supposed
to
be
their
natural
invariable
and
irreconcilable
enemies
lived
in
perfect
harmony
with
my
pet
rodents
the
rats
never
showed
the
slightest
distrust
of
the
cats
nor
did
the
cats
ever
betray
their
confidence
was
very
much
attached
to
them
he
would
sit
close
to
their
cage
and
observe
their
gambols
for
hours
together
and
if
by
any
chance
the
door
of
the
room
in
which
they
were
left
was
shut
he
would
scratch
and
mew
gently
until
some
one
came
to
open
it
and
allow
him
to
rejoin
his
little
white
friends
who
would
often
come
out
of
the
cage
and
sleep
close
to
him
seraphita
who
was
of
a
more
reserved
and
disdainful
temper
and
who
disliked
the
musky
odor
of
the
white
rats
took
no
part
in
their
games
but
she
never
did
them
any
harm
and
would
let
them
pass
before
her
without
putting
out
a
claw
who
came
from
havana
required
a
hothouse
temperature
and
this
he
always
had
in
his
own
apartments
the
house
was
however
surrounded
by
extensive
gardens
divided
by
railings
through
and
over
which
cats
could
easily
climb
and
in
those
gardens
were
trees
inhabited
by
a
great
number
of
birds
pierrot
would
frequently
take
advantage
of
an
open
door
to
get
out
of
an
evening
and
go
through
the
wet
grass
and
and
as
his
mewing
under
the
windows
when
he
wanted
to
get
in
again
did
not
always
awaken
the
sleepers
in
the
house
he
frequently
had
to
stay
out
until
morning
his
chest
was
delicate
and
one
very
chilly
night
he
caught
a
cold
which
rapidly
developed
into
phthisis
at
the
end
of
a
year
of
coughing
poor
don
pierrot
had
wasted
to
a
skeleton
and
his
coat
once
so
silky
was
a
dull
harsh
white
his
large
transparent
eyes
looked
unnaturally
large
in
his
shrunken
face
the
pink
of
his
little
nose
had
faded
and
he
dragged
himself
slowly
along
the
sunny
side
of
the
wall
with
a
melancholy
air
looking
at
the
yellow
autumnal
leaves
as
they
danced
and
whirled
in
the
wind
nothing
is
so
touching
as
a
sick
animal
it
submits
to
suffering
with
such
gentle
and
sad
resignation
we
did
all
in
our
power
to
save
pierrot
a
skilful
doctor
came
to
see
him
felt
his
pulse
sounded
his
lungs
and
ordered
him
ass
milk
he
drank
the
prescribed
beverage
very
readily
out
of
his
own
especial
china
saucer
for
hours
together
he
lay
stretched
upon
my
knee
like
the
shadow
of
a
sphinx
i
felt
his
spine
under
my
finger
tips
like
the
beads
of
a
rosary
and
he
tried
to
respond
to
my
caresses
by
a
feeble
purr
that
resembled
a
on
the
day
of
his
death
he
was
lying
on
his
side
panting
and
suddenly
with
a
supreme
effort
he
rose
and
came
to
me
his
large
eyes
were
opened
wide
and
he
gazed
at
me
with
a
look
of
intense
supplication
a
look
that
seemed
to
say
me
save
me
you
who
are
a
man
then
he
made
a
few
faltering
steps
his
eyes
became
glassy
and
he
fell
down
uttering
so
lamentable
a
cry
so
dreadful
and
full
of
anguish
that
i
was
struck
dumb
and
motionless
with
horror
he
was
buried
at
the
bottom
of
the
garden
under
a
white
rose
tree
which
still
marks
the
place
of
his
sepulture
three
years
later
seraphita
died
and
was
buried
by
the
side
of
don
pierrot
with
her
the
white
dynasty
became
extinct
but
not
the
family
this
couple
had
three
children
who
were
as
black
as
ink
let
any
one
explain
that
mystery
who
can
the
kittens
were
born
in
the
early
days
of
the
great
renown
of
victor
miserables
when
everybody
was
talking
of
the
new
masterpiece
and
the
names
of
the
personages
in
it
were
in
every
mouth
the
two
little
male
creatures
were
called
enjolras
and
gavroche
and
their
sister
received
the
name
of
eponine
they
were
very
pretty
and
i
trained
them
to
run
after
a
little
ball
of
paper
and
bring
it
back
to
me
when
i
threw
it
into
the
corner
of
the
room
in
time
they
would
follow
the
ball
up
to
the
top
of
the
bookcase
or
fish
for
it
behind
boxes
or
in
the
bottom
of
china
vases
with
their
dainty
little
paws
as
they
grew
up
they
came
to
disdain
those
frivolous
amusements
and
assumed
the
philosophical
and
meditative
quiet
which
is
the
true
temperament
of
the
cat
to
the
eyes
of
the
careless
and
indifferent
observer
three
black
cats
are
just
three
black
cats
but
those
who
are
really
acquainted
with
animals
know
that
their
physiognomy
is
as
various
as
that
of
the
human
race
i
was
perfectly
well
able
to
distinguish
between
these
little
faces
as
black
as
harlequin
mask
and
lighted
up
by
disks
of
emerald
with
golden
gleams
enjolras
who
was
much
the
handsomest
of
the
three
was
remarkable
for
his
broad
leonine
head
and
full
whiskers
strong
shoulders
and
a
superb
feathery
tail
there
was
something
theatrical
and
pretentious
in
his
air
like
the
posing
of
a
popular
actor
his
movements
were
slow
undulatory
and
majestic
so
circumspect
was
he
about
where
he
set
his
feet
down
that
he
always
seemed
to
be
walking
among
glass
and
china
his
disposition
was
by
no
means
stoical
and
he
was
much
too
fond
of
food
to
have
been
approved
of
by
his
namesake
the
temperate
and
austere
enjolras
would
certainly
have
said
to
him
as
the
angel
said
to
swedenborg
eat
too
much
i
encouraged
his
gastronomical
tastes
and
enjolras
attained
a
very
unusual
size
and
weight
gavroche
was
a
remarkably
knowing
cat
and
looked
it
he
was
wonderfully
active
and
his
twists
twirls
and
tumbles
were
very
comic
he
was
of
a
bohemian
temperament
and
fond
of
low
company
thus
he
would
occasionally
compromise
the
dignity
of
his
descent
from
the
illustrious
grandee
of
spain
of
the
first
class
and
the
marquesa
dona
seraphita
of
aristocratic
and
disdainful
bearing
he
would
sometimes
return
from
his
expeditions
to
the
street
accompanied
by
gaunt
starved
companions
whom
he
had
picked
up
in
his
wanderings
and
he
would
stand
complacently
by
while
they
bolted
the
contents
of
his
plate
of
food
in
a
violent
hurry
and
in
dread
of
dispersion
by
a
broomstick
or
a
shower
of
water
i
was
sometimes
tempted
to
say
to
gavroche
nice
lot
of
friends
you
pick
up
but
i
refrained
for
after
all
it
was
an
amiable
weakness
he
might
have
eaten
his
dinner
all
by
himself
the
interesting
eponine
was
more
slender
and
graceful
than
her
brothers
and
she
was
an
extraordinarily
sensitive
nervous
and
electric
animal
she
was
passionately
attached
to
me
and
she
would
do
the
honors
of
my
hermitage
with
perfect
grace
and
propriety
when
the
bell
rang
she
hastened
to
the
door
received
the
visitors
conducted
them
to
the
salon
made
them
take
seats
talked
to
them
yes
talked
with
little
coos
murmurs
and
cries
quite
unlike
the
language
which
cats
use
among
themselves
and
which
bordered
on
the
articulate
speech
of
man
what
did
she
say
she
said
quite
plainly
be
impatient
look
at
the
pictures
or
talk
with
me
if
i
amuse
you
my
master
is
coming
down
on
my
appearing
she
would
retire
discreetly
to
an
or
the
corner
of
the
piano
and
listen
to
the
conversation
without
interrupting
it
like
a
animal
accustomed
to
good
society
eponine
intelligence
fine
disposition
and
sociability
led
to
her
being
elevated
by
common
consent
to
the
dignity
of
a
person
for
reason
superior
instinct
plainly
governed
her
conduct
that
dignity
conferred
on
her
the
right
to
eat
at
table
like
a
person
and
not
in
a
corner
on
the
floor
from
a
saucer
like
an
animal
eponine
had
a
chair
by
my
side
at
breakfast
and
dinner
but
in
consideration
of
her
size
she
was
privileged
to
place
her
fore
paws
on
the
table
her
place
was
laid
without
a
knife
and
fork
indeed
but
with
a
glass
and
she
went
regularly
through
dinner
from
soup
to
dessert
awaiting
her
turn
to
be
helped
and
behaving
with
a
quiet
propriety
which
most
children
might
imitate
with
advantage
at
the
first
stroke
of
the
bell
she
would
appear
and
when
i
came
into
the
dining
room
she
would
be
at
her
post
upright
in
her
chair
her
fore
paws
on
the
edge
of
the
tablecloth
and
she
would
present
her
smooth
forehead
to
be
kissed
like
a
little
girl
who
was
affectionately
polite
to
relatives
and
old
people
when
we
had
friends
to
dine
with
us
eponine
always
knew
that
company
was
expected
she
would
look
at
her
place
and
if
a
knife
fork
and
spoon
lay
near
her
plate
she
would
immediately
turn
away
and
seat
herself
on
the
her
invariable
refuge
let
those
who
deny
the
possession
of
reason
to
animals
explain
if
they
can
this
little
fact
apparently
so
simple
but
which
contains
a
world
of
induction
from
the
presence
near
her
plate
of
those
implements
which
only
man
can
use
the
observant
and
judicious
cat
concluded
that
she
ought
on
this
occasion
to
give
way
to
a
guest
and
she
hastened
to
do
so
she
was
never
mistaken
only
when
the
visitor
was
a
person
whom
she
knew
and
liked
she
would
jump
on
his
knee
and
coax
him
for
a
bit
off
his
plate
by
her
graceful
caresses
she
survived
her
brothers
and
was
my
dear
companion
for
several
years
such
is
the
chronicle
of
the
black
dynasty
although
cats
have
no
place
in
the
bible
neither
can
their
enemies
who
sing
the
praise
of
the
dog
find
much
advantage
there
for
that
most
excellent
animal
is
referred
to
in
anything
but
a
complimentary
fashion
for
without
are
dogs
and
sorcerers
the
great
prophet
of
allah
however
knew
a
good
cat
when
he
saw
it
muezza
even
contributed
her
small
share
to
the
development
of
the
mahometan
system
for
did
she
not
sit
curled
up
in
her
master
sleeve
and
by
her
soft
purring
soothe
and
deepen
his
meditations
and
did
she
not
keep
him
dreaming
so
long
that
she
finally
became
exhausted
herself
and
fell
asleep
in
his
flowing
sleeve
whereupon
did
not
mahomet
rather
than
disturb
her
and
feeling
that
he
must
be
about
his
business
cut
off
his
sleeve
rather
than
disturb
the
much
loved
muezza
the
nurses
of
cairo
tell
this
story
to
their
young
charges
to
this
day
cardinal
richelieu
had
many
a
kitten
too
and
morose
and
as
he
was
found
in
them
much
amusement
his
love
for
them
however
was
not
that
unselfish
love
which
led
mahomet
to
cut
off
his
sleeve
but
simply
a
selfish
desire
for
passing
amusement
he
cared
nothing
for
that
most
interesting
process
the
development
of
a
kitten
into
a
cat
and
the
study
of
its
individuality
which
is
known
only
to
the
real
lover
of
cats
for
it
is
recorded
of
him
that
as
soon
as
his
pets
were
three
months
old
he
sent
them
away
evidently
not
caring
where
and
procured
new
ones
champfleury
however
thinks
it
possible
that
there
may
not
be
any
real
foundation
for
this
story
about
richelieu
he
refers
to
the
fact
that
moncrif
says
not
a
word
about
the
celebrated
cardinal
passion
for
those
creatures
but
he
does
say
everybody
knows
that
one
of
the
greatest
ministers
france
ever
possessed
colbert
always
had
a
number
of
kittens
playing
about
that
same
cabinet
in
which
so
many
institutions
both
honorable
and
useful
to
the
nation
had
their
origin
can
it
be
that
richelieu
has
been
given
credit
for
virtues
in
various
parts
of
chateaubriand
memoires
may
be
found
eulogiums
on
the
cat
so
well
known
was
his
fondness
for
them
that
even
when
his
other
feelings
and
interests
faded
with
age
and
decay
his
affections
for
cats
remained
strong
to
the
end
this
love
became
well
known
to
all
his
compeers
and
once
on
an
embassy
to
rome
the
pope
gave
him
a
cat
he
was
called
micetto
according
to
chateaubriand
biographer
de
marcellus
pope
leo
xii
cat
could
not
fail
to
reappear
in
the
description
of
that
domestic
hearth
where
i
have
so
often
seen
him
basking
in
fact
chateaubriand
has
immortalized
his
favorite
in
the
sketch
which
begins
companion
is
a
big
cat
of
a
greyish
red
this
ecclesiastical
pet
was
always
dignified
and
imposing
in
manners
ever
conscious
that
he
had
been
the
gift
of
a
sovereign
pontiff
and
had
a
tremendous
weight
of
reputation
to
maintain
he
used
to
stroke
his
tail
when
he
desired
madame
recamier
to
know
that
he
was
tired
i
love
in
the
cat
said
chateaubriand
to
de
marcellus
that
independent
and
almost
ungrateful
temper
which
prevents
it
from
attaching
itself
to
any
one
the
indifference
with
which
it
passes
from
the
salon
to
the
when
you
caress
it
it
stretches
itself
out
and
arches
its
back
indeed
but
that
is
caused
by
physical
pleasure
not
as
in
the
case
of
the
dog
by
a
silly
satisfaction
in
loving
and
being
faithful
to
a
master
who
returns
thanks
in
kicks
the
cat
lives
alone
has
no
need
of
society
does
not
obey
except
when
it
likes
and
pretends
to
sleep
that
it
may
see
the
more
clearly
and
scratches
everything
that
it
can
scratch

one
in
that
select
circle
who
was
not

to
don
a
wig
and
robe
while
acting
in
a
judicial
capacity
then
there
was

proud

used
to
wear
gold
earrings
as
he
sat
at
the
feet
of

perhaps
but
not

in
the
tomb
of

in

at

between
his

feet
in

is
one
of
the

of

my

of

he
says
which
divided
us
from
each
other
in
our
respective
thoughts
prejudiced
my
cat
very
strongly
against
my
books
sometimes
her
little
head
would
project
its
profile
on
the
page
which
i
was
perusing
as
though
she
were
trying
to
discover
what
it
was
that
thus
absorbed
me
doubtless
she
did
not
understand
why
i
should
look
for
my
happiness
beyond
the
presence
of
a
devoted
heart
her
solicitude
was
no
less
manifest
when
she
brought
me
rats
or
mice
she
acted
in
this
case
exactly
as
if
i
had
been
her
son
dragging
enormous
rats
still
in
the
throes
of
death
to
my
feet
and
she
was
evidently
guided
by
logic
in
offering
me
a
prey
commensurate
with
my
size
for
she
never
presented
any
such
large
game
to
her
kittens
her
affectionate
attention
invariably
caused
her
a
severe
disappointment
having
laid
the
product
of
her
hunting
expedition
at
my
feet
she
would
appear
to
be
greatly
hurt
by
my
indifference

delicious
fare

although
la

in
his
fables
shows
such
a
delicate
appreciation
of
their
character
and
ways
it
is
doubtful
whether
he
honestly
loved
cats
but
his
friend
and
patron
the
duchess
of
bouillon
was
so
devoted
to
them
that
she
requested
the
poet
to
make
her
a
copy
with
his
own
hand
of
all
his
fables

in

it
is
said
could
never
pass
a
cat
in
the
street
without
stopping
to
stroke
and
fondle
it
many
a
time
said
champfleury
when
he
and
i
have
been
walking
together
have
we
stopped
to
look
at
a
cat
curled
luxuriously
in
a
pile
of
fresh
white
linen
revelling
in
the
cleanliness
of
the
newly
ironed
fabrics
into
what
fits
of
contemplation
have
we
fallen
before
such
windows
while
the
coquettish
laundresses
struck
attitudes
at
the
ironing
boards
under
the
mistaken
impression
that
we
were
admiring
them
it
was
also
related
of
baudelaire
that
going
for
the
first
time
to
a
house
he
is
restless
and
uneasy
until
he
has
seen
the
household
cat
but
when
he
sees
it
he
takes
it
up
kisses
and
strokes
it
and
is
so
completely
absorbed
in
it
that
he
makes
no
answer
to
what
is
said
to
him

notorious
fondness
for
cats
was
a
fad

he
shared
with
paul

novelist

at
one
time
kept
as
many
as
thirty
cats
in
his
house
many
descriptions
of
them
are
to
be
found
scattered
through
his
novels
his

written
a
charming
and
most
touching
history
of

all

concerning
cats
in
england
if
the
growing
fancy
for
cats
in
this
country
is
benefiting
the
feline
race
as
a
whole
they
have
to
thank
the
english
people
for
it
for
certain
cats
in
england
are
held
at
a
value
that
seems
preposterous
to
unsophisticated
americans
at
one
cat
and
bird
show
held
at
the
crystal
palace
near
london
some
of
the
cats
were
valued
at
hundred
pounds
sterling
as
much
as
the
price
of
a
for
more
than
a
quarter
of
a
century
national
cat
shows
have
been
held
at
crystal
palace
and
the
westminster
aquarium
which
have
given
great
stimulus
to
the
breeding
of
fine
cats
and
catteries
where
cats
and
kittens
are
raised
are
common
throughout
the
country
england
was
the
first
too
to
care
for
lost
and
deserted
cats
and
dogs
at
battersea
there
is
a
temporary
home
for
both
these
unfortunates
where
between
twenty
and
thousand
dogs
and
cats
are
sheltered
and
fed
the
objects
of
this
home
which
is
supported
entirely
by
voluntary
subscriptions
are
to
restore
lost
pets
to
their
owners
to
find
suitable
homes
for
unclaimed
cats
and
dogs
and
to
painlessly
destroy
useless
and
diseased
ones
there
is
a
commodious
cat
house
where
pets
may
be
boarded
during
their
owner
absence
and
a
separate
house
where
lost
and
deserted
felines
are
sheltered
fed
and
kindly
tended
since
long
before
whittington
became
lord
mayor
of
london
indeed
cats
have
been
popular
in
england
for
did
not
the
law
protect
them
as
to
the
truth
of
the
story
of
whittington
cat
there
has
been
much
earnest
discussion
although
whittington
lived
from
about
to
the
story
seems
to
have
been
pretty
generally
accepted
for
three
hundred
years
after
his
death
a
portrait
still
exists
of
him
with
one
hand
holding
a
cat
and
when
his
old
house
was
remodelled
in
recent
times
a
carved
stone
was
found
in
it
showing
a
boy
with
a
cat
in
his
arms
several
similar
tales
have
been
found
it
is
argued
in
which
the
heroes
in
different
countries
have
started
to
make
a
fortune
by
selling
a
cat
but
as
rats
and
mice
were
extremely
common
then
and
it
has
been
shown
that
a
single
pair
of
rats
will
in
three
years
multiply
into
over
six
hundred
thousand
which
will
eat
as
much
as
thousand
men
why
should
a
cat
be
deemed
a
luxury
even
for
a
king
palace
the
argument
that
the
cat
of
whittington
was
a
cat
or
boat
used
for
carrying
coal
is
disproved
by
the
fact
that
no
account
of
such
vessels
in
whittington
time
can
be
found
and
also
that
the
trade
in
coal
did
not
begin
in
europe
for
some
time
afterward
and
there
really
seems
nothing
improbable
in
the
story
that
at
a
time
when
a
kitten
big
enough
to
kill
mice
brought
fourpence
in
england
such
an
animal
taken
to
a
catless
country
might
not
be
sold
for
a
sum
large
enough
to
start
an
enterprising
youth
in
trade
surely
the
beginnings
of
some
of
our
own
railroad
kings
and
financiers
may
as
well
look
doubtful
to
future
generations
it
is
a
pretty
story
that
of
whittington
how
he
rose
from
being
a
mere
scullion
at
fourteen
to
being
thrice
lord
mayor
of
london
according
to
what
are
claimed
to
be
authentic
documents
the
story
is
something
more
than
a
nursery
tale
and
runs
thus
poor
dick
whittington
was
born
at
shropshire
of
such
very
poor
parents
that
the
boy
being
of
an
ambitious
nature
left
home
at
fourteen
and
walked
to
london
where
he
was
taken
into
the
hospital
of
john
at
clerkenwell
in
a
menial
capacity
the
prior
noticing
his
good
behavior
and
diligent
conduct
took
a
fancy
to
him
and
obtained
him
a
position
in
a
household
on
tower
hill
for
some
time
at
this
place
his
prospects
did
not
improve
he
was
nothing
but
a
scullion
ridiculed
and
disliked
by
the
cook
and
other
servants
add
to
this
the
fact
that
an
incredible
swarm
of
mice
and
rats
infested
the
miserable
room
in
which
he
slept
and
it
would
seem
that
he
was
indeed
a
poor
richard
one
fortunate
day
however
he
conceived
the
idea
of
buying
a
cat
and
as
good
luck
would
have
it
he
was
enabled
within
a
few
days
to
earn
a
penny
or
two
by
blacking
the
boots
of
a
guest
at
the
house
that
day
he
met
a
woman
with
a
cat
for
sale
and
after
some
dickering
for
she
asked
more
money
for
it
than
the
boy
possessed
in
the
world
dick
whittington
carried
home
his
cat
and
put
it
in
a
cupboard
or
closet
opening
from
his
room
that
night
when
he
retired
he
let
the
cat
out
of
the
cupboard
and
she
evidently
had
no
end
of
fun
for
according
to
these
authentic
accounts
she
destroyed
all
the
vermin
which
ventured
to
make
their
appearance
for
some
time
after
that
she
passed
her
days
in
the
cupboard
in
hiding
from
the
cook
and
her
nights
in
catching
mice
and
then
came
the
change
fitzwarren
was
fitting
out
a
vessel
for
algiers
and
kindly
offered
all
his
servants
a
chance
to
send
something
to
barter
with
the
natives
poor
dick
had
nothing
but
his
cat
but
the
commercial
instinct
was
even
then
strong
within
him
and
with
an
enterprise
worthy
of
the
early
efforts
of
any
of
our
men
he
decided
to
send
that
and
accordingly
placed
it
while
the
tears
run
plentifully
down
his
cheeks
in
the
hands
of
the
master
of
the
vessel
she
must
have
been
a
most
exemplary
cat
for
by
the
time
they
had
reached
algiers
the
captain
was
so
fond
of
her
that
he
allowed
no
one
to
handle
her
but
himself
not
even
he
however
expected
to
turn
her
into
money
but
the
opportunity
soon
came
at
a
state
banquet
given
by
the
dey
the
captain
and
his
officers
were
astonished
to
notice
that
rats
and
mice
ran
freely
in
and
out
stealing
half
the
choice
food
which
was
spread
on
the
carpet
and
this
was
a
common
occurrence
the
captain
saw
his
or
whittington
opportunity
and
stated
that
he
knew
a
certain
remedy
for
this
state
of
affairs
whereupon
he
was
invited
to
dinner
next
day
to
which
he
carried
the
cat
and
the
natural
consequence
ensued
this
sudden
and
swift
extermination
of
the
pests
drove
the
dey
and
his
court
half
frantic
with
delight
and
the
captain
who
must
have
been
the
original
progenitor
of
the
yankee
race
drove
a
sharp
bargain
by
assuming
to
be
unwilling
to
part
with
the
cat
so
that
the
dey
finally
sent
on
board
his
ship
the
choicest
commodities
consisting
of
gold
jewels
and
silks
meanwhile
things
had
gone
from
bad
to
worse
with
the
youth
destined
to
become
not
only
lord
mayor
of
london
but
the
envy
and
admiration
of
future
generations
of
youths
and
he
made
up
his
mind
to
run
away
from
his
place
this
he
did
but
while
he
was
on
his
way
to
more
rural
scenes
he
sat
down
on
a
stone
at
the
foot
of
highgate
hill
a
stone
that
still
remains
marked
as
whittington
stone
and
paused
to
reflect
on
his
prospects
his
thoughts
turned
back
to
the
home
he
had
left
where
he
had
at
least
plenty
to
eat
and
although
the
authentic
reports
use
a
great
many
words
to
tell
us
so
the
boy
was
homesick
just
then
the
sound
of
bow
bells
reached
him
and
to
his
youthful
fancy
seemed
to
call
him
back
return
return
whittington
thrice
lord
mayor
of
london
thus
the
old
tale
hath
it
at
any
rate
the
boy
gave
up
the
idea
of
flight
and
went
back
to
fitzwarren
house
the
second
night
after
his
master
sent
for
him
in
the
midst
of
one
of
the
cook
tirades
and
going
to
the
parlour
he
was
apprised
of
his
sudden
wealth
because
added
to
the
rest
of
his
good
luck
that
captain
happened
to
be
an
honest
man
and
then
he
went
into
trade
and
married
the
daughter
of
fitzwarren
and
became
lord
mayor
of
london
and
lived
even
happier
ever
after
than
they
do
in
most
fairy
tales
and
everybody
even
the
cook
admired
and
loved
him
after
he
had
money
and
position
as
has
been
known
to
happen
outside
of
fairy
tales
whether
or
not
cats
in
england
owe
anything
of
their
position
to
the
whittington
story
it
is
certain
that
they
have
more
really
appreciating
friends
there
than
in
any
other
country
the
older
we
grow
in
the
refinements
of
civilization
the
more
we
value
the
finely
bred
cat
in
england
it
has
long
been
the
custom
to
register
the
pedigree
of
cats
as
carefully
as
in
this
country
do
with
their
fancy
pets
some
account
of
the

chapter
queen
victoria
and
the
princess
of
wales
and
indeed
many
members
of
the
nobility
are
and
doubtless
this
fact
influences
the
general
sentiment
in
england
among
the
most
devoted
of
pussy
english

is
the
hon
mclaren

is
the

of

of

of

delicate

a

the
numberless

worthy
of
the
art

one
could
linger
for
hours
in
these
delightful

most
comfortable

the

account
in
his
sons
daughters
grandsons
and
granddaughters
have
all
taken

at

in
the
silver
tabby
classes
since
that
time
lady
marcus
beresford
has
for
the
last
fifteen
years
made
quite
a
business
of
the
breeding
and
rearing
of
cats
at
bishopsgate
near
egham
she
has
what
is
without
doubt
the
finest
cattery
i
have
applications
from
all
parts
of
the
world
for
my
cats
and
kittens
said
lady
marcus
in
a
talk
about
her
hobby
and
i
may
tell
you
that
it
is
largely
because
of
this
that
i
founded
the
cat
club
which
has
for
its
object
the
general
welfare
of
the
cat
and
the
improvement
of
the
breed
my
catteries
were
established
in
and
at
one
time
i
had
as
many
as
cats
and
kittens
some
of
my
pets
live
in
a
pretty
cottage
covered
with
creepers
which
might
well
be
called
cat
cottage
no
expense
has
been
spared
in
the
fittings
of
the
rooms
and
every
provision
is
made
for
warmth
and
ventilation
one
room
is
set
apart
for
the
girl
who
takes
entire
charge
of
and
feeds
the
pussies
she
has
a
boy
who
works
with
her
and
performs
the
rougher
tasks
there
is
a
small
kitchen
for
cooking
the
meals
for
the
cats
and
this
is
fitted
with
every
requisite
on
the
walls
are
racks
to
hold
the
white
enamelled
bowls
and
plates
used
for
the
food
there
is
a
medicine
chest
which
contains
everything
that
is
needful
for
prompt
and
efficacious
treatment
in
case
pussy
becomes
sick
on
the
wall
are
a
list
of
the
names
and
a
full
description
of
all
the
inmates
of
the
cattery
and
a
set
of
rules
to
be
observed
by
both
the
cats
and
their
attendants
these
rules
are
not
ignored
and
it
is
a
tribute
to
the
intelligence
of
the
cat
to
see
how
carefully
pussy
can
become
amenable
to
discipline
if
once
given
to
understand
of
what
that
discipline
consists
then
there
is
a
garden
cattery
i
think
this
is
the
prettiest
of
all
it
is
covered
with
roses
and
ivy
in
this
there
are
three
rooms
provided
with
shelves
and
all
other
conveniences
which
can
add
to
the
cats
comfort
and
amusement
the
residences
of
the
male
cats
are
most
complete
for
i
have
given
them
every
attention
possible
each
male
cat
has
his
separate
sleeping
apartments
closed
with
wire
and
with
a
attached
close
at
hand
is
a
large
square
grass
and
in
this
each
gentleman
takes
his
daily
but
solitary
exercise
one
of
the
stringent
rules
of
the
cattery
is
that
no
two
males
shall
ever
be
left
together
and
i
know
that
with
my
cats
if
this
rule
were
not
observed
both
in
letter
and
precept
it
would
be
a
case
of
greek
meets
greek
i
vary
the
food
for
my
cats
as
much
as
possible
one
day
we
will
have
most
appetizing
bowls
of
fish
and
rice
at
the
proper
time
you
can
see
these
standing
in
the
cat
kitchen
ready
to
be
distributed
another
day
these
bowls
will
be
filled
with
minced
meat
in
the
very
hot
weather
a
good
deal
of
vegetable
matter
is
mixed
with
the
food
swiss
milk
is
given
so
there
is
no
fear
of
its
turning
sour
for
some
time
i
have
kept
a
goat
on
the
premises
the
milk
from
which
is
given
to
the
delicate
or
younger
kittens
i
have
started
many
of
my
poorer
friends
in
cat
breeding
and
they
have
proved
conclusively
how
easily
an
addition
to
their
income
can
be
made
not
only
by
breeding
good
persian
kittens
and
selling
them
but
by
exhibiting
them
at
the
various
shows
and
taking
prizes
but
of
course
there
is
a
fashion
in
cats
as
in
everything
else
when
i
started
breeding
blue
persians
about
fifteen
years
ago
they
were
very
scarce
and
i
could
easily
get
dollars
apiece
for
my
kittens
now
this
variety
is
less
sought
after
and
commonly
called
chinchillas
are
in
demand

a
very
large
and

cat
is
kept
as
an
advertisement
of
the
good

to
be
obtained
on
the
premises
there
is
invariably
a
cat
in
a
shop
and
the
animal
is
generally
one
that
was
originally
white
but
long
ago
came
to
the
conclusion
that
all
attempts
to
keep
itself
clean
were
hopeless

only
consolation
is
that
it
is
never
blacker
than
its
master

is
well
known
that

are
much
esteemed
in

animals

not

esteemed

fondness
for

is

well

that
there
was

of

at

such

there
is
now
an
annual
exposition
feline
internationale
in
this
country
the
first
cat
show
of
general
interest
was
held
at
madison
square
garden
new
york
in
may
some
years
before
there
had
been
a
cat
show
under
the
auspices
of
private
parties
in
boston
and
several
minor
shows
had
been
held
at
newburgh
and
other
places
but
the
new
york
shows
were
the
first
to
attract
general
attention
one
hundred
and
cats
were
exhibited
by
one
hundred
and
owners
besides
several
ocelots
wild
cats
and
civets
for
some
reason
the
show
at
madison
square
garden
in
march
catalogued
only
one
hundred
and
cats
and
owners
since
that
time
there
have
been
no
large
cat
shows
in
new
york
there
have
been
several
cat
shows
in
boston
since
but
these
are
so
far
only
adjuncts
to
poultry
and
pigeon
shows
great
interest
has
been
manifest
in
them
however
and
the
entries
have
each
year
run
above
a
hundred
some
magnificent
cats
are
exhibited
although
as
a
rule
the
animals
shown
are
somewhat
small
many
kittens
being
placed
there
for
sale
by
breeders
several
attempts
to
start
successful
cat
clubs
in
this
country
have
been
made
at
the
close
of
the
new
york
show
in
an
american
cat
club
was
organized
for
the
purpose
of
investigating
ascertaining
and
keeping
a
record
of
the
pedigrees
of
cats
and
of
instituting
maintaining
controlling
and
publishing
a
stud
book
or
book
of
registry
of
such
kind
of
domestic
animals
in
the
united
states
of
america
and
canada
and
of
promoting
and
holding
exhibitions
of
such
animals
and
generally
for
the
purpose
of
improving
the
breed
thereof
and
educating
the
public

will
be
given
for
the
benefit
of

the

has
done
excellent
work
also
having
established
a

homeless
or
diseased
cats
with
a

for
three
months
during
the
absence
of
its

in

and
also
to

this

was
incorporated
under

laws
of

on

in
connection
with
it
is
a
children
cat
club
which
has
for
its
primary
object
the
teaching
of
kindness
to
animals
by
awakening
in
the
young
people
an
appreciative
love
for
cats
at

fifty
cents
for
each
cat
the
cat
shows
already
held
and
the
flourishing
state
of
our
cat
clubs
have
proved
that
america
has
as
fine
if
not
finer
cats
than
can
be
found
in
england
and
that
interest
in
finely
bred
cats
is
on
the
increase
in
this
country
the
effect
of
the
successful
cat
clubs
and
cat
shows
must
be
to
train
intelligent
judges
and
to
raise
the
standard
of
cats
in
this
country
it
will
also
tend
to
make
the
cat
shows
of
such
a
character
that
owners
need
not
hesitate
to
enter
their
choicest
cats
as
yet
however
the
judging
at
cat
shows
is
not
so
well
managed
as
in
england
it
should
be
a
rule
that
the
judges
of
cats
should
not
only
understand
their
fine
points
but
should
be
in
sympathy
with
the
little
pets
cat
dealers
who
have
a
number
of
cats
entered
for
competition
should
not
be
allowed
on
the
board
of
judges
in
england
the
cats
to
be
judged
are
taken
by
classes
into
a
tent
for
the
purpose
and
the
door
is
fastened
against
all
but
the
judges
whereas
over
here
the
cats
are
too
often
taken
out
of
their
cages
in
the
presence
of
a
crowd
of
spectators
and
judged
on
a
table
or
some
public
place
thereby
frightening
the
timid
ones
and
bringing
annoyance
to
the
owners
again
there
should
be
several
judges
in
england
there
are
seven
including
two
or
three
women
and
these
are
assigned
to
different
classes
harrison
weir
the
authority
on
cats
and
louis
wain
the
cat
artist
are
among
them
in
this
country
there
are
a
number
of
women
who
are
not
dealers
but
who
are
fully
posted
in
the
necessary
qualifications
for
a
cat
american
cat
shows
should
have
at
least
three
judges
one
of
whom
at
least
should
be
a
woman
a
cat
should
be
handled
gently
and
kept
as
calm
as
possible
during
the
judging
women
are
naturally
more
gentle
in
their
methods
and
more
tenderhearted
when
my
pets
are
entered
for
competition
may
some
wise
kind
woman
have
the
judging
of
them
in
judging
a
cat
the
quality
and
quantity
of
its
fur
is
the
first
thing
considered
in
a
cat
this
includes
the
lord
mayor
chain
or
frill
the
tail
and
most
important
of
all
the
the
tufts
between
the
toes
and
the
flexibility
of
the
tail
are
other
important
points
the
shape
of
head
eyes
and
body
are
also
carefully
noted
a
cat
is
judged
first
for
color
then
for
eyes
head
symmetry
and
ears
in
all
cats
the
head
should
show
breadth
between
the
eyes
the
eyes
should
be
round
and
open
white
cats
to
be
really
valuable
should
have
blue
eyes
without
deafness
black
cats
should
have
yellow
eyes
other
cats
should
have
eyes
or
in
some
cases
as
in
the
brown
eyes
the
nose
should
be
short
and
tapering
the
teeth
should
be
good
and
the
claws
flat
the
lower
leg
should
be
straight
and
the
upper
hind
leg
lie
at
closed
angles
the
foot
should
be
small
and
round
in
the
maltese
pointed
a
good
cat
has
a
light
frame
but
a
deep
chest
a
slim
graceful
and
fine
neck
ears
with
rounded
tips
the
croup
should
be
square
and
high
the
tail
of
a
cat
long
and
tapering
and
of
a
cat
broad
and
bent
over
at
the
end
the
good
results
of
a
cat
show
are
best
told
in
a
few
words
by
one
who
has
acted
as
judge
at
an
american
exhibition
one
year
he
said
people
have
to
learn
that
there
is
such
a
thing
as
a
cat
the
next
they
come
to
the
show
and
learn
to
tell
the
different
breeds
another
year
they
learn
the
difference
between
a
good
cat
and
a
poor
one
and
the
next
year
they
become
exhibitors
and
tell
the
judges
how
to
award
the
premiums

fine

all
the

the
most
highly
valued
cat
in
america
is
napoleon
the
great
whose
owner
has
refused
four
thousand
dollars
for
him
a
magnificent
fellow
he
is
too
with
his
bushy
orange
fur
and
lionlike
head
he
is
ten
years
old
and
weighs
pounds
which
is
a
remarkable
weight
in
a
male
cat
only
gelded
ones
ordinarily
running
above
fifteen
pounds
napoleon
was
bred
by
a
french
nobleman
and
was
born
at
the
chateau
fontainebleau
near
paris
in
he
is
a
pure
french
angora
which
is
shown
by
his
long
crinkly
hair
so
long
that
it
has
to
be
frequently
clipped
to
preserve
the
health
and
comfort
of
the
beautiful
creature
this
clipping
is
what
causes
the
uneven
quality
of
fur
which
appears
in
his
picture
his
mother
was
a
famous
cat
and
his
grandmother
was
one
of
the
grandest
dams
of
france
no
pun
intended
the
latter
lived
to
be
nineteen
years
old
and
consequently
napoleon
the
great
is
regarded
by
his
owners
as
a
mere
youth
he
has
taken
first
prizes
and
medals
wherever
he
has
been
exhibited
and
at

won
the
silver
cup
offered

hundred

she
is
a

beautiful

all
these

are
great
pets
and
are
allowed
the
freedom
of
the
house
and
barns
although
when
they
run
about
the
grounds
there
is
always
a
man
in
attendance
six
or
seven
thousand
dollars
worth
of
cats
sporting
on

together
is
a
rich
sight

not
altogether
without
risk

for
the
majestic

fond
of

very
shy
with

when

desk
or
a

next
his
master
bed

of

end
colonel

is
a
devoted
lover
of

has
given
a
standing
order
that
none
of
his
employees
shall
if
they
see
a
starving
kitten
on
the
street
leave
it
to
suffer
and
die
accordingly
his

a
sort

refuge

unfortunate

there

seem
to
appreciate
the
kindness
which
surrounds
them
the

the
cats
used
to
crawl
out
on

alas
the

to
their
deaths

australian
cats

country
where
they
are
universally
admired
his
columbia
is
valued
at
six
hundred
dollars
and
his
tricksey
at
five
hundred
dollars
they
are
indeed
beautiful
creatures
though
somewhat
unique
in
the
cat
world
as
we
see
it
they
are
very
sleek
cats
with
fur
so
short
glossy
and
fine
that
it
looks
like
the
finest
satin
their
heads
are
small
and
narrow
with
noses
that
seem
pointed

compared
with
other
cats
they
are
very
intelligent
and
affectionate

creatures

make
the
loveliest
of
pets

hammond
are
extremely
fond
of
their
unusual
and
valuable
cat
family
and
tell
the
most
interesting
tales
of
their
antics
and
habits
his
columbia
was
an
imported
cat
and
the
doctor
has
reason
to
believe
that
she
with
her
mate
are
originally
from
the
siamese
cat
imported
from
siam
to
australia
they
are
all
very
delicate
as
kittens
the
mother
rarely
having
more
than
one
at
a
time
with
two
exceptions
these
cats
have
never
had
more
than
two
kittens
at
a
litter
they
are
very
partial
to
heat
but
can
not
stand
cold
weather
they
have
spells
of
sleeping
when
nothing
has
power
to
disturb
them
but
when
they
do
wake
up
they
have
a
high
time
running
and
playing
they
are
affectionate
being
very
fond
of
their
owner
but
rather
shy
with
strangers
they
are
uncommonly
intelligent
too
and
are
very
teachable
when
young
they
are
such
beautiful
creatures
besides
being
rare
in
this
part
of
the
world
that
it
is
altogether
probable
that
they
will
be
much
sought
after
as
pets
chapter
ix
concerning
cats
in
poetry
as
far
back
as
the
ninth
century
a
poem
on
a
cat
was
written
which
has
come
down
to
us
from
the
arabic
its
author
was
ibn
alalaf
alnaharwany
of
bagdad
who
died
in
or
he
was
one
of
the
better
known
poets
of
the
khalifate
and
his
work
may
still
be
found
in
the
original
the
following
verses
which
were
translated
by
carlyle
are
confessedly
a
paraphrase
rather
than
a
strict
translation
but
of
course
the
sense
is
the
same
commentators
differ
on
the
question
as
to
whether
the
poet
really
meant
anything
more
in
this
poem
than
to
sing
of
the
death
of
a
pet
and
some
have
tried
to
ascribe
to
it
a
hidden
meaning
which
implies
beautiful
slaves
lovers
and
assignations
just
as
the
wise
browning
student
discovers
meanings
in
that
great
works
of
which
he
never
dreamed
nevertheless
we
who
love
cats
are
fain
to
believe
that
this
follower
of
mahomet
meant
only
to
celebrate
the
merits
perhaps
it
would
hardly
do
to
call
them
virtues
of
his
beloved
cat
the
lines
are
inscribed
on
a
cat
that
was
killed
as
she
was
attempting
to
rob

alalaf

poor
puss
is
gone
is
fate
decree
yet
i
must
still
her
loss
deplore
for
dearer
than
a
child
was
she
and
shall
i
behold
her
more
with
many
a
sad
presaging
tear
this
morn
i
saw
her
steal
away
while
she
went
on
without
a
fear
except
that
she
should
miss
her
prey
i
saw
her
to
the
climb
with
cautious
feet
and
slow
she
stept
resolved
to
balance
loss
of
time
by
eating
faster
than
she
crept
her
subtle
foes
were
on
the
watch
and
marked
her
course
with
fury
fraught
and
while
she
hoped
the
birds
to
catch
an
arrow
point
the
huntress
caught
in
fancy
she
had
got
them
all
and
drunk
their
blood
and
sucked
their
breath
alas
she
only
got
a
fall
and
only
drank
the
draught
of
death
why
why
was

flesh
so
nice
that
thoughtless
cats
should
love
it

hadst
thou
but
lived
on
rats

thou
hadst
been
living

such
joys

thomas
gray
poem
on
the
death
of
robert
walpole
cat
which
was
drowned
in
a
bowl
of
goldfish
was
greatly
prized
by
the
latter
after
the
death
of
the
poet
the
bowl
was
placed
on
a
pedestal
at
strawberry
hill
with
a
few
lines
from
the
poem
as
an
inscription
in
a
letter
dated
march
accompanying
it
gray
says
as
one
ought
to
be
particularly
careful
to
avoid
blunders
in
a
compliment
of
condolence
it
would
be
a
sensible
satisfaction
to
me
before
i
testify
my
sorrow
and
the
sincere
part
i
take
in
your
misfortune
to
know
for
certain
who
it
is
i
lament
note
the
i
knew
zara
and
selima
selima
was
it
or
fatima
or
rather
i
knew
them
both
together
for
i
can
not
justly
say
which
was
which
then
as
to
your
handsome
cat
the
name
you
distinguish
her
by
i
am
no
less
at
a
loss
as
well
knowing
one
handsome
cat
is
always
the
cat
one
likes
best
or
if
one
be
alive
and
the
other
dead
it
is
usually
the
latter
that
is
the
handsomest
besides
if
the
point
were
never
so
clear
i
hope
you
do
not
think
me
so
ill
bred
or
so
imprudent
as
to
forfeit
all
my
interest
in
the
survivor
oh
no
i
would
rather
seem
to
mistake
and
imagine
to
be
sure
it
must
be
the
tabby
one
that
had
met
with
this
sad
accident
till
this
affair
is
a
little
better
determined

will

he
closes
the
letter
by
saying
there
a
poem
for
you
it
is
rather
too
long
for
an
epitaph
and
then
the
familiar
was
on
a
lofty
vase
side
where
china
gayest
art
had
the
azure
flowers
that
blow
demurest
of
the
tabby
kind
the
pensive
selima
reclined
gazed
on
the
lake
below
wordsworth
kitten
and
the
falling
leaves
is
in
the
high
moralizing
style
that
way
look
my
infant
lo
what
a
pretty
baby
show
see
the
kitten
on
the
wall
sporting
with
the
leaves
that
fall
but
the
kitten
how
she
starts
crouches
stretches
paws
and
darts
first
at
one
and
then
its
fellow
just
as
light
and
just
as
yellow
there
are
many
now
now
one
now
they
stop
and
there
are
none
what
intentness
of
desire
in
her
upward
eye
of
fire
with
a
halfway
now
she
meets
the
coming
prey
lets
it
go
as
fast
and
then
has
it
in
her
power
again
now
she
works
with
three
or
four
like
an
indian
conjuror
quick
as
he
in
feats
of
art
far
beyond
in
joy
of
heart
were
her
antics
played
in
the
eye
of
a
thousand
clapping
hands
with
shout
and
stare
what
would
little
tabby
care
for
the
plaudits
of
the
crowd
over
happy
to
be
proud
over
wealthy
in
the
treasure
of
her
own
exceeding
pleasure
pleased
by
any
random
toy
by
a
kitten
busy
joy
or
an
infant
laughing
eye
sharing
in
the
ecstacy
i
would
fain
like
that
or
this
find
my
wisdom
in
my
bliss

the
sprightly
soul
awake

cowper
love
for
animals
was
well
known
at
one
time
according
to
lady
hesketh
he
had
besides
two
dogs
two
goldfinches
and
two
canaries
five
rabbits
three
hares
two
a
squirrel
a
magpie
a
jay
and
a
starling
in
addition
he
had
at
least
one
cat
for

hesketh
says
one
evening
the
cat
giving
one
of
the
hares
a
sound
box
on
the
ear
the
hare
ran
after
her
and
having
caught
her
punished
her
by
drumming
on
her
back
with
her
two
feet
hard
as
drumsticks
till
the
creature
would
actually
have
been
killed
had
not
unwin
rescued
her
it
might
have
been
this
very
cat
that
was
the
inspiration
of
cowper
poem
to
a
retired
cat
which
had
as
a
moral
the
familiar
stanza
beware
of
too
sublime
a
sense
of
your
own
worth
and
consequence
the
man
who
dreams
himself
so
great
and
his
importance
of
such
weight
that
all
around
in
all
that
done
must
move
and
act
for
him
alone
will
learn
in
school
of
tribulation
the
folly
of
his
expectation

so
by
kind
treatment
to

the
cat
is
as
sacred
as
it
was
to
the
egyptians
of
old
the
society
of
his
feline
pets
is
to
him
ever
delightful
and
consoling
and
it
may
have
inspired
him
to
write
some
of
his
most
melodious
verses
nevertheless
he
is
not
the

poet
it
was

here
is
a
version
in
verse
of
the
famous
kilkenny
cats
she
was
an
irishman
as
very
well
was
known
and
she
lived
down
in
kilkenny
and
she
lived
there
all
alone
with
only
six
great
large
that
knowed
their
ways
about
and
everybody
else
besides
she
scrupulously
shut
out
oh
very
fond
of
cats
was
she
and
whiskey
too
is
said
she
did
feed
very
much
but
she
combed
well
instead
as
may
be
guessed
these
large
did
not
get
very
sleek
upon
a
combing
once
a
day
and
a
once
a
week
now
on
one
dreary
winter
night
she
went
to
bed
with
a
whiskey
bottle
under
her
arm
the
whiskey
in
her
head
the
six
great
large
they
all
sat
in
a
dismal
row
and
horridly
glared
their
hazy
eyes
their
tails
wagged
to
and
fro
at
last
one
grim
graymalkin
spoke
in
accents
dire
to
tell
and
dreadful
were
the
words
which
in
his
horrid
whisper
fell
and
all
the
six
large
in
answer
loud
did
squall
kill
her
and
let
eat
her
body
bones
and
all
oh
horrible
oh
terrible
oh
deadly
tale
to
tell
when
the
sun
shone
through
the
all
seemed
still
and
well
the
cats
they
sat
and
licked
their
paws
all
in
a
merry
ring
but
nothing
else
in
all
the
house
looked
like
a

these
six

they
one
another
swallered
and
naught

one

the

for
which
i

of
high
order

a
lover

cats
the

there
was

they

of

the

no

chapter
x
concerning
cat
artists
while
thousands
of
artists
first
and
last
have
undertaken
to
paint
cats
there
are
but
few
who
have
been
able
to
do
them
justice
artists
who
have
possessed
the
technical
skill
requisite
to
such
delicate
work
have
rarely
been
willing
to
give
to
what
they
have
regarded
as
unimportant
subjects
the
necessary
study
and
those
who
have
been
willing
to
study
cats
seriously
have
possessed
but
seldom
the
skill
requisite
to
paint
them
well
thomas
janvier
whose
judgment
on
such
matters
is
unquestioned
declares
that
not
a
dozen
have
succeeded
in
painting
thoroughly
good
cat
portraits
portraits
so
true
to
nature
as
to
satisfy
if
they
could
express
their
feelings
in
the
premises
the
cat
subjects
and
their
cat
friends
only
four
painters
he
says
ever
painted
cats
habitually
and
always
well
two
members
of
this
small
but
highly
distinguished
company
flourished
about
a
century
ago
in
widely
separated
parts
of
the
world
and
without
either
of
them
knowing
that
the
other
existed
one
was
a
japanese
artist
named
whose
method
of
painting
of
course
was
quite
unlike
that
to
which
we
are
accustomed
in
this
western
part
of
the
world
but
who
had
a
wonderful
faculty
for
making
his
queer
little
cat
figures
seem
intensely
alive
the
other
was
a
swiss
artist
named
gottfried
mind
whose
cat
pictures
are
so
perfect
in
their
way
that
he
came
to
be
honorably
known
as
the
cat
raphael
the
other
two
members
of
the
cat
quartet
are
the
french
artist
monsieur
louis
eugene
lambert
whose
pictures
are
almost
as
well
known
in
this
country
as
they
are
in
france
and
the
dutch
artist
madame
henriette
ronner
whose
delightful
cat
pictures
are
known
even
better
as
she
catches
the
softer
and
sweeter
graces
of
the
cat
more
truly
than
lambert
a
thoroughly
good
picture
of
a
cat
is
hard
to
paint
from
a
technical
standpoint
because
the
artist
must
represent
not
only
the
soft
surface
of
fur
but
the
underlying
hard
lines
of
muscle
and
his
studies
must
be
made
under
conditions
of
cat
perversity
which
are
at
times
quite
enough
to
drive
him
wild
if
he
is
to
represent
the
cat
in
repose
he
must
wait
for
her
to
take
that
position
of
her
own
accord
and
then
just
as
his
sketch
is
well
under
way
she
is
liable
to
rise
stretch
herself
and
walk
off
if
his
picture
is
to
represent
action
he
must
wait
for
the
cat
to
do
what
he
wants
her
to
do
and
that
many
times
before
he
can
be
quite
sure
that
his
drawing
is
correct
with
these
severe
limitations
upon
cat
painting
it
is
not
surprising
that
very
few
good
pictures
of
cats
have
been
painted
gottfried
mind
has
left
innumerable
pen
sketches
to
prove
his
intimate
knowledge
of
the
beauty
and
charm
of
the
cat
he
was
born
at
berne
in
he
had
a
special
taste
for
drawing
animals
even
when
very
young
bears
and
cats
being
his
favorite
subjects
as
he
grew
older
he
obtained
a
wonderful
proficiency
and
his
cat
pictures
appeared
with
every
variety
of
expression
their
silky
coats
their
graceful
attitudes
their
firm
shape
beneath
the
undulating
fur
were
treated
so
as
to
make
mind
cats
seem
alive
it
was
madame
lebrun
who
named
him
the
raphael
of
cats
and
many
a
royal
personage
bought
his
pictures
he
like
most
cat
painters
kept
his
cats
constantly
with
him
knowing
that
only
by
persistent
and
never
tiring
study
could
he
ever
hope
to
master
their
infinite
variety
his
favorite
mother
cat
kept
closely
at
his
side
when
he
worked
or
perhaps
in
his
lap
while
her
kittens
ran
over
him
as
fearlessly
as
they
played
with
their
mother
tail
when
a
terrible
epidemic
broke
out
among
the
cats
of
berne
in
he
hid
his
minette
safely
from
the
police
but
he
never
quite
recovered
from
the
horror
of
the
massacre
of
the
eight
hundred
that
had
to
be
sacrificed
for
the
general
safety
of
the
people
he
died
in
and
in
poverty
although
a
few
years
afterward
his
pictures
brought
extravagant
prices
burbank
the
english
painter
has
done
some
good
things
in
cat
pictures
the
expression
of
the
face
and
the
peculiar
light
in
the
cat
eye
made
up
the
realism
of
burbank
pictures
which
were
reproductions
of
sleek
and
handsome
pets
whose
shining
coats
he
brings
out
with
remarkable
precision
the
swiss
artist
cornelius
wisscher
marvellous
has
become
typical
delacroix
the
painter
of
tigers
was
a
man
of
highly
nervous
temperament
but
his
cat
sketches
bring
out
too
strongly
the
tigerish
element
to
be
altogether
successful
louis
eugene
lambert
was
a
pupil
of
delacroix
he
was
born
in
paris
september
and
the
chief
event
of
his
youth
was
perhaps
the
great
friendship
which
existed
between
him
and
maurice
sands
entomology
was
a
fad
with
him
for
a
time
but
he
finally
took
up
his
serious
in
when
he
began
illustrating
for
the
of
in
connection
with
his
work
he
began
to
study
animals
carefully
making
dogs
his
specialty
in
he
illustrated
an
edition
of
la
fontaine
and
in
he
obtained
his
first
medal
for
a
painting
of
dogs
in
his
painting
of
cats
qui
avance
won
another
medal
and
brought
his
first
fame
as
a
cat
painter
in
he
was
made
a
chevalier
of
the
legion
of
honor
his
envoi
in
les
chats
du
cardinal
and
grandeur
decline
brought
more
medals
although
he
has
painted
hosts
of
excellent
dog
pictures
cats
are
his
favorites
on
account
as
he
says
of
les

fines
et
gracieux

et
subtil
in
the
luxembourg
gallery
lambert
family
of
cats
is
considered
one
of
the
finest
cat
pictures
in
the
world
in
this
painting
the
mother
sits
upon
a
table
watching
the
antics
of
her
four
frivolous
kittens
there
is
a
wonderful
smoothness
of
touch
and
refinement
of
treatment
that
have
never
yet
been
excelled
after
the
banquet
is
another
excellent
example
of
the
same
smoothness
of
execution
with
fulness
of
action
instead
of
repose
and
yet
there
is
an
undeniable
lack
of
the
softer
attributes
which
should
be
evident
in
the
faces
of
the
group
it
is
here
that
madame
ronner
excels
all
other
cat
painters
living
or
dead
she
not
only
infuses
a
wonderful
degree
of
life
into
her
little
figures
but
reproduces
the
shades
of
expression
shifting
and
variable
as
the
sands
of
the
sea
as
no
other
artist
of
the
brush
has
done
asleep
or
awake
her
cats
look
exactly
to
the
felinarian
like
cats
with
whom
he
or
she
is
familiar
curiosity
drowsiness
indifference
alertness
love
hate
anxiety
temper
innocence
cunning
fear
confidence
mischief
earnestness
dignity
helplessness
they
are
all
in
madame
ronner
cats
faces
just
as
we
see
them
in
our
own
cats
madame
ronner
is
the
daughter
of
josephus
augustus
knip
a
landscape
painter
of
some
celebrity
sixty
years
ago
and
from
her
father
she
received
her
first
art
education
she
is
now
over
seventy
years
old
and
for
nearly
fifty
years
has
made
her
home
in
brussels
there
she
and
her
happy
cats
a
big
black
newfoundland
dog
named
priam
with
a
pert
cockatoo
named
coco
dwell
together
in
a
roomy
house
in
its
own
grounds
back
a
little
from
the
charleroi
road
madame
ronner
has
a
good
son
to
care
for
her
and
she
loves
the
animals
who
are
both
her
servants
and
her
friends
every
day
she
spends
three
good
hours
of
the
morning
in
her
studio
painting
her
delightful
cat
pictures
with
the
energy
of
a
young
artist
and
the
expert
precision
which
we
know
so
well
she
was
sixteen
when
she
succeeded
in
painting
a
picture
which
was
accepted
and
sold
at
a
public
exhibition
at
dusseldorf
this
was
a
study
of
a
cat
seated
in
a
window
and
examining
with
great
curiosity
a
bumblebee
while
it
would
not
compare
with
her
later
work
there
must
have
been
good
quality
in
it
or
it
would
not
have
got
into
a
dusseldorf
picture
exhibition
at
all
at
any
rate
it
was
the
beginning
of
her
successful
career
as
an
artist
from
that
time
she
managed
to
support
herself
and
her
father
by
painting
pictures
of
animals
for
many
years
however
she
confined
herself
to
painting
dogs
her
most
famous
picture
the
friend
of
man
belongs
to
this
period
a
pathetic
group
composed
of
a
sorrowing
old
looking
down
upon
a
dying
dog
still
harnessed
to
the
little
with
the
two
other
dogs
standing
by
with
wistful
looks
of
sympathy
when
this
picture
was
exhibited
in
madame
ronner
fame
was
established
permanently
but
it
so
happened
that
in
the
same
year
a
friendly
kitten
came
to
live
in
her
home
wandering
in
through
the
open
doorway
from
no
one
knew
where
and
deciding
after
sniffing
about
the
place
in
cat
fashion
to
remain
there
for
the
remainder
of
its
days
and
it
also
happened
that
madame
ronner
was
lured
by
this
small
stranger
who
so
coolly
quartered
himself
upon
her
to
change
the
whole
current
of
her
artistic
life
and
to
paint
cats
instead
of
dogs
of
course
this
change
could
not
be
made
in
a
moment
but
after
that
the
pictures
which
she
painted
to
please
herself
were
cat
pictures
and
as
these
were
exhibited
and
her
reputation
as
a
cat
painter
became
established
cat
orders
took
the
place
of
dog
orders
more
and
more
until
at
last
her
time
was
given
wholly
to
cat
painting
her
success
in
painting
cat
action
has
been
due
as
much
to
her
tireless
patience
as
to
her
skill
a
patience
that
gave
her
strength
to
spend
hours
upon
hours
in
carefully
watching
the
quick
movements
of
the
lithe
little
creatures
and
in
correcting
again
and
again
her
rapidly
made
sketches
every
knows
that
a
cat
can
not
be
induced
either
by
reason
or
by
affection
to
act
in
accordance
with
any
wishes
save
its
own
also
that
cats
find
malicious
amusement
in
doing
what
they
know
they
are
not
wanted
to
do
and
that
with
an
affectation
of
innocence
that
materially
aggravates
their
deliberate
offence
but
madame
ronner
through
her
long
experience
has
evolved
a
way
to
get
them
to
pose
as
models
her
plan
is
the
simple
one
of
keeping
her
models
prisoners
in
a
glass
box
enclosed
in
a
wire
cage
while
she
is
painting
them
inside
the
prison
she
can
not
always
command
their
actions
but
her
knowledge
of
cat
character
enables
her
to
a
certain
extent
to
persuade
them
to
take
the
pose
which
she
requires
by
placing
a
comfortable
cushion
in
the
cage
she
can
tempt
her
model
to
lie
down
some
object
of
great
interest
like
a
live
mouse
for
instance
exhibited
just
outside
the
cage
is
sure
to
create
the
eager
look
that
she
has
shown
so
well
on
cat
faces
and
to
induce
her
kittens
to
indulge
in
the
leaps
and
bounds
which
she
has
succeeded
so
wonderfully
in
transferring
to
canvas
she
keeps
hanging
from
the
top
of
the
cage
a
most
seductive
bob
madame
ronner
favorite
models
are
jem
and
monmouth
cats
of
rare
sweetness
of
temper
whose
conduct
in
all
relations
of
life
is
above
reproach
the
name
of
monmouth
as
many
will
recall
was
made
famous
by
the
hero
of
monsieur
la
bedolierre
classic
mother
michel
and
her
cat
footnote
translated
into
english
by
thomas
bailey
aldrich
and
therefore
has
clustering
about
it
traditions
so
glorious
that
its
wearers
in
modern
times
must
be
upheld
always
by
lofty
hopes
and
high
resolves
doubtless
monmouth
ronner
feels
the
responsibility
entailed
upon
him
by
his
name
in
the
european
galleries
are
several
noted
paintings
in
which
the
cat
appears
more
or
less
unsuccessfully
breughel

their
grotesque

famous
but
one
can
scarcely
see
why
since
the
drawing
is
poor
and
there
is
no
real
insight
into
cat
character
evident
the

is
better
being
well
drawn
but
so
small
as
to
leave

successful

artist
such
devotion
to

the
invariable
price
of
distinction
of

more
artists
are
found

are

are

thousands
of
readers
recall
those
wonderfully
lifelike
cats
and
kittens
which
were
a
feature
of
the
a
few
years
ago
accompanied
by
nonsense
rhymes
or
jingles
they
were
the
work
of
joseph
francis
of
brookline
and
brought
him
no
little
fame
he
was
and
is
still
a
broker
on
state
street
boston
and
in
his
busy
life
these
inimitable
cat
sketches
were
but
an
incident
francis
is
a
devoted
admirer
of
all
cats
and
had
for
many
years
loved
and
studied
one
cat
in
particular
it
was
by
accident
that
he
discovered
his
own
possibilities
in
the
line
of
cat
drawing
as
he
began
making
little
sketches
for
his
own
amusement
and
then
for
that
of
his
friends
the
latter
persuaded
him
to
send
some
of
these
drawings
to
the
and
the
magazines
and
rather
to
his
surprise
they
were
promptly
accepted
and
the
francis
cats
became
famous
francis
does
but
little
artistic
work
nowadays
more
important
business
keeping
him
well
occupied
besides
he
says
he
is
not
in
the
mood
for
it

louis

that
prince
of

wain
home
when
not

is
at
bendigo
lodge
westgate
kent
he
began
his
artistic
career
at
nineteen
after
a
training
in
the
best
london
schools
he
was
not
a
hard
worker
over
his
books
but
his
fondness
for
nature
led
him
to
an
artist
career
american
indian
stories
were
his
delight
and
accounts
of
the
wandering
outdoor
life
of
our
aborigines
were
instrumental
in
developing
his
powers
of
observation
regarding
the
details
of
nature
always
fond
of
dumb
animals
he
began
life
by
making
sketches
for
sporting
papers
at
agricultural
shows
all
over
england
it
was
his
own
cat
peter
who
first
suggested
to
louis
wain
the
fanciful
cat
creations
which
have
made
his
name
famous
watching
peter
antics
one
evening
he
was
tempted
to
do
a
small
study
of
kittens
which
was
promptly
accepted
by
a
magazine
editor
in
london
then
he
trained
peter
to
become
a
model
and
the
of
his
success
peter
has
done
more
to
wipe
out
of
england
the
contempt
in
which
the
cat
was
formerly
held
there
than
any
other
feline
in
the
world
he
has
done
his
race
a
service
in
raising
their
status
from
neglected
forlorn
creatures
on
the
one
hand
or
the
pampered
overfed

with
as
many
varying
facial
expressions
and
attitudes
it
occupied
eleven
working
days
of
wain
time
but
it
caught
the
public
fancy
and
made
a
tremendous
hit
all
over
the
world
louis
wain
cats
immediately
became
famous
and
he
has
had
more
orders
than
he
can
fill
ever
since
he
works
eight
hours
a
day
and
then
lays
aside
his
brush
to
study
physical
science
or
write
a
humorous
story
he
has
written
and
illustrated
a
comic
book
and
spent
a
great
deal
of
time
over
a
more
serious
one
among
the
best
known
of
his
cat
pictures
after
the
christmas
party
is
his
cats
rights
meeting
which
not
even
the
most
ardent
suffragist
can
study
without
laughter
from
a
desk
an
ardent
tabby
is
expounding
loud
and
long
on
the
rights
of
her
kind
in
front
of
her
is
a
double
row
of
felines
sitting
with
folded
arms
and
listening
with
absorbed
attention
the
expressions
of
these
cats
faces
some
ardent
some
indignant
some
placid
but
all
interested
form
a
ridiculous
contrast
to
a
row
of
toms
in
the
rear
who
evidently
disagree
with
the
lecturer
and
are
prepared
to
hiss
at
her
more
advanced
ideas
returning
thanks
is
nearly
as
amusing
with
its
thirteen
cats
seated
at
table
over
their
wine
while
one
offers
thanks
and
the
remainder
wear
varying
expressions
of
devotion
indifference
or
irreverence
bringing
home
the
yule
log
gives
cats
and
as
many
individual
expressions
of
joy
or
discomfort
and
the
snowball
match
shows
a
scene
almost
as
hilarious
as
the
christmas
dance
wain
believes
there
is
a
great
future
for
black
and
white
work
if
a
man
is
careful
to
keep
abreast
of
the
times
a
man
should
first
of
all
create
his
public
and
draw
upon
his
own
fund
of
originality
to
sustain
it
he
says
taking
care
not
to
pander
to
the
degenerate
tendencies
which
would
prevent
his
work
from
elevating
the
finer
instincts
of
the
people
says
a
recent
visitor
to
the
wain
household
i
wonder
if
peter
realizes
that
he
has
done
more
good
than
most
human
beings
who
are
endowed
not
only
with
sense
but
with
brains
if
in
the
firelight
he
sees
the
faces
of
many
a
suffering
child
whose
hours
of
pain
have
been
shortened
by
the
recital
of
his
tricks
and
the
pictures
of
himself
arrayed
in
white
cravat
or
gayly
disporting
himself
on
a
i
feel
inclined
to
wake
him
up
and
whisper
how
one
cold
winter
night
i
met
a
party
of
five
little
children
hatless
and
bootless
hurrying
along
an
slum
and
saying
encouragingly
to
the
youngest
who
was
crying
with
cold
and
hunger
along
we
get
there
soon
i
followed
them
down
the
lighted
street
till
they
paused
in
front
of
a
barber
shop
and
i
heard
their
voices
change
to
a
shout
of
merriment
for
in
the
window
was
a
crumpled
christmas
supplement
and
peter
in
a
frolicsome
mood
was
represented
entertaining
at
a
large
hunger
and
cold
and
misery
were
all
dispelled
who
would
not
be
a
cat
of
louis
wain
capable
of
creating
ten
minutes
sunshine
in
a
childish
heart
wain
announces
a
discovery
in
relation
to
cats
which
corroborates
a
theory
of
my
own
adopted
from
long
observation
and
experience
i
have
found
he
says
as
a
result
of
many
years
of
inquiry
and
study
that
people
who
keep
cats
and
are
in
the
habit
of
petting
them
do
not
suffer
from
those
petty
ailments
which
all
flesh
is
heir
to
rheumatism
and
nervous
complaints
are
uncommon
with
them
and
lovers
are
of
the
sweetest
temperament
i
have
often
felt
the
benefit
after
a
long
spell
of
mental
effort
of
having
my
cats
sitting
across
my
shoulders
or
of
half
an
hour
chat
with
peter
this
is
a
frequent
experience
of
my
own
nothing
is
more
restful
and
soothing
after
a
busy
day
than
sitting
with
my
hands
buried
in
the
soft
sides
of
one
of
my
cats
do
you
know
said
one
of
my
neighbors
recently
when
i
am
troubled
with
insomnia
lately
i
get
up
and
get
bingo
from
his
bed
and
take
him
to
mine
i
can
go
to
sleep
with
my
hands
on
him
there
is
a
powerful
magnetic
influence
which
emanates
from
a
sleepy
or
even
a
quiet
cat
that
many
an
invalid
has
experienced
without
realizing
it
if
physicians
were
to
investigate
this
feature
of
the
electrical
and
magnetic
influence
in
place
of
anatomical
research
after
death
or
the
horrible
practice
of
vivisection
they
might
be
doing
a
real
service
to
humanity
wain
success
as
an
illustrator
brought
him
great
prominence
in
the
national
cat
club
of
england
and
he
has
been
for
a
number
of
years
its
president
doing
much
to
raise
the
condition
and
quality
of
cats
and
the
status
of
the
club
he
has
a
number
of
beautiful
and
cats
at
bendigo
lodge
with
regard
to
the
painting
of
cats
champfleury
said
the
lines
are
so
delicate
the
eyes
are
distinguished
by
such
remarkable
qualities
the
movements
are
due
to
such
sudden
impulses
that
to
succeed
in
the
portrayal
of
such
a
subject
one
must
be
feline
one
self
and
spielman
gives
the
following
advice
to
those
who
would
paint
cats
you
must
love
them
as
mahomet
and
chesterfield
loved
them
be
as
fond
of
their
company
as
wolsley
and
richelieu
mazarin
and
colbert
who
retained
them
even
during
their
most
impressive
audiences
as
petrarch
and
johnson
and
canon
liddon
and
ludovic
halévy
who
wrote
with
them
at
their
elbow
and
tasso
and
gray
who
celebrated
them
in
verse
as
sympathetic
as
carlyle
whom
allingham
painted
in
the
company
of
his
beloved
in
the
garden
at
chelsea
or
as
whittington
the
hero
of
our
days
think
of
el
daher
beybars
who
fed
all
feline
comers
or
belle
stewart
duchess
of
richmond
who
in
the
words
of
the
poet
a
college
for
her
little
friends
you
must
be
as
approbative
of
their
character
their
amenableness
to
education
their
inconstancy
not
to
say
indifference
and
their
general
lack
of
principle
as
madame
de
custine
and
as
appreciative
of
their
daintiness
and
grace
as
alfred
de
musset
then
and
not
till
then
can
you
consider
yourself
sentimentally
equipped
for
studying
the
art
of
cat
painting
chapter
xi
concerning
cat
hospitals
and
refuges
at
comparatively
frequent
intervals
we
read
of
some
woman
historic
or
modern
who
has
left
an
annuity
as
the
duchess
of
richmond
la
belle
stewart
for
the
care
of
her
pet
cats
now
and
then
a
man
provides
for
them
in
his
will
as
lord
chesterfield
for
instance
who
left
a
permanent
pension
for
his
cats
and
their
descendants
but
i
find
only
one
who
has
endowed
a
home
for
them
and
given
it
sufficient
means
to
support
the
strays
and

who
reach
its
shelter
early
in
the
eighties
captain
nathan
appleton
of
boston
a
brother
of
the
poet
longfellow
wife
and
of
thomas
appleton
the
celebrated
wit
returned
from
a
stay
in
london
with
a
new
idea
that
of
founding
some
sort
of
a
refuge
or
hospital
for
sick
or
stray
cats
and
dogs
he
had
visited
battersea
and
been
deeply
impressed
with
the
need
of
a
shelter
for
small
and
friendless
domestic
animals
at
battersea
there
is
an
institution
similar
to
the
one
the
society
for
prevention
of
cruelty
to
animals
in
new
york
have
at
east
street
where
stray
animals
may
be
sent
and
kept
for
a
few
days
awaiting
the
possible
appearance
of
a
claimant
or
owner
at
the
end
of
which
time
the
animals
are
placed
in
the
lethal
chamber
where
they
die
instantly
and
painlessly
by
asphyxiation
in
boston
the
society
of
prevention
of
cruelty
to
animals
have
no
such
refuge
or
pound
but
in
place
of
it
keep
one
or
two
men
whose
business
it
is
to
go
wherever
sent
and
mercifully
put
to
death
the
superfluous
maimed
or
sick
animals
that
shall
be
given
them
captain
appleton
idea
however
was
something
entirely
different
from
this
these
creatures
he
argued
have
a
right
to
their
lives
and
the
pursuit
of
happiness
after
their
own
fashion
and
he
proposed
to
help
them
to
enjoy
that
right
he
appealed
to
a
few
sympathetic
friends
and
gave
two
or
three
acres
of
land
from
his
own
estate
near
nonantum
hill
where
the
apostle
eliot
preached
to
the
indians
and
where
his
iodine
springs
are
located
he
had
raised
a
thousand
or
two
dollars
and
planned
a
structure
of
some
kind
to
shelter
stray
dogs
and
cats
when
the
good
angel
that
attends
our
household
pets
guided
him
to
the
lawyer
who
had
charge
of
the
estates
of
miss
ellen
gifford
of
new
haven
i
think
i
can
help
you
said
the
lawyer
but
he
would
say
nothing
more
at
that
time
a
few
weeks
later
captain
appleton
was
sent
for
miss
gifford
had
become
deeply
interested
in
the
project
and
after
making
more
inquiries
gave
the
proposed
home
some
thousand
dollars
adding
to
this
amount
afterward
and
providing
for
the
institution
in
her
will
it
has
already
had
over
one
hundred
thousand
dollars
from
miss
gifford
estates
and
it
is
so
well
endowed
and
well
managed
that
it
is
the
ellen
gifford
sheltering
home
for
animals
is
situated
near
the
brookline
edge
of
the
brighton
district
in
boston
in
fact
the
residential
portion
of
aristocratic
brookline
is
so
fast
creeping
up
to
it
that
the
whole
six
acres
of
the
institution
will
doubtless
soon
be
disposed
of
at
a
very
handsome
profit
while
the
dogs
and
cats
will
retire
to
a
more
remote
district
to
live
on
the
interest
of
their
money
the
main
building
is
a
small
but
handsome
brick
affair
facing
on
lake
street
this
is
the
home
of
the
superintendent
and
contains
besides
the
offices
of
the
establishment
over
the
office
is
a
tablet
with
this
inscription
taken
from
a
letter
of
miss
gifford
about
the
time
the
home
was
opened
if
only
the
waifs
the
strays
the
sick
the
abused
would
be
sure
to
get
entrance
to
the
home
and
anybody
could
feel
at
liberty
to
bring
in
a
starved
or
animal
and
have
it
cared
for
without
pay
my
object
would
be
obtained
march
the
superintendent
is
a
lover
of
animals
as
well
as
a
good
business
manager
and
his
work
is
in
line
with
the
sentence
just
quoted
any
one
wanting
a
cat
or
a
dog
and
who
can
promise
it
a
good
home
may
apply
there
but
perkins
does
not
take
the
word
of
a
stranger
at
random
he
investigates
their
circumstances
and
character
and
never
gives
away
an
animal
unless
he
can
be
reasonably
sure
of
its
going
to
a
good
home
for
instance
he
once
received
an
application
from
one
man
for
six
cats
the
wholesale
element
in
the
order
made
him
slightly
suspicious
and
he
immediately
drove
to
boston
where
he
found
that
his
customer
owned
a
big
granary
overrun
with
mice
he
sent
the
six
cats
and
two
weeks
later
went
to
see
how
they
were
getting
on
when
he
found
them
living
happily
in
a
big
fat
and
contented
as
the
most
devoted
sultan
of
egypt
could
have
asked
none
but
street
cats
and
stray
dogs
homeless
waifs
and
half
starved
are
received
at
this
home
occasionally
some
family
desiring
to
get
rid
of
the
animal
they
have
petted
for
months
perhaps
years
will
send
it
over
to
the
sheltering
home
but
if
perkins
can
find
where
it
came
from
he
promptly
returns
it
for
even
this
place
capable
of
comfortably
housing
a
hundred
cats
and
as
many
dogs
can
not
accommodate
all
the
unfortunates
that
are
picked
up
in
the
streets
of
boston
the
accommodations
too
while
they
are
comfortable
and
even
luxurious
for
the
poor
creatures
that
have
hitherto
slept
on
and
stone
flaggings
are
unfit
for
household
pets
that
have
slept
on
cushions
soft
rugs
and
bed
there
is
a
and
a
sufficiently
far
apart
that
the
occupants
of
one
need
not
be
disturbed
by
those
of
the
other
in
the
there
are
rows
of
pens
on
each
side
of
the
middle
aisle
in
which
from
one
to
four
or
five
dogs
according
to
size
are
kept
when
indoors
these
are
of
all
sorts
colors
dispositions
and
sizes
ranging
from
pugs
to
bernards
terriers
to
mastiffs
there
are
few
purely
bred
dogs
although
there
are
many
intelligent
and
really
handsome
ones
the
dogs
are
allowed
to
run
in
the
big
yard
that
opens
out
from
their
house
at
certain
hours
of
the
day
but
the
cats
yards
are
open
to
them
all
day
and
night
all
yards
and
runs
are
enclosed
with
wire
netting
and
the
has
partitions
of
the
same
all
around
the
sides
of
the
are
shelves
or
bunks
which
are
kept
supplied
with
clean
hay
for
their
beds
here
one
may
see
cats
of
every
color
and
assorted
sizes
contentedly
curled
up
in
their
nests
while
their
companions
sit
blinking
in
the
sun
or
run
out
in
the
yards
cooked
meat
crackers
and
milk
and
dishes
of
fresh
water
are
kept
where
they
can
get
at
them
the
cats
all
look
plump
and
well
fed
and
indeed
the
ordinary
street
cat
must
feel
that
his
lines
have
fallen
in
pleasant
places
not
so
however
with
pet
cats
who
may
be
housed
there
they
miss
the
companionship
of
people
and
the
household
belongings
to
which
they
have
been
accustomed
sometimes
it
is
really
pathetic
to
see
one
of
these
pets
climb
up
the
wire
netting
and
plainly
beg
the
visitor
to
take
him
away
from
that
strange
place
and
give
him
such
a
home
as
he
has
been
used
to
in
the
superintendent
house
there
is
usually
a
good
cat
or
two
of
this
sort
as
he
is
apt
to
test
a
cat
before
giving
him
away
somewhat
similar
and
even
older
than
the
ellen
gifford
sheltering
home
is
the
morris
refuge
of
philadelphia
this
institution
whose
motto
is
the
lord
is
good
to
all
and
his
tender
mercies
are
over
all
his
works
was
first
established
in
may
by
miss
elizabeth
morris
and
other
ladies
who
took
an
interest
in
the
protection
of
suffering
animals
it
does
not
limit
its
tender
mercies
to
cats
and
dogs
but
cares
for
every
suffering
animal
it
differs
from
the
ellen
gifford
home
chiefly
in
the
fact
that
while
the
latter
is
a
for
stray
cats
and
dogs
the
morris
refuge
has
for
its
object
the
care
for
and
disposal
of
suffering
animals
of
all
sorts
in
a
word
it
brings
relief
to
most
of
these
unfortunate
creatures
by
means
of
a
swift
and
painless
death
it
was
first
known
as
the
city
refuge
although
it
was
never
maintained
by
the
city
in
january
it
was
reorganized
and
incorporated
as
the
morris
refuge
for
homeless
and
suffering
animals
it
is
supported
by
private
contributions
and
is
under
the
supervision
of
miss
morris
and
a
corps
of
ladies
of
philadelphia
a
wagon
is
kept
at
the
home
to
respond
to
calls
and
visits
any
residence
where
suffering
animals
may
need
attention
the
agent
of
the
society
lives
at
the
refuge
with
his
family
and
receives
animals
at
any
time
when
notice
is
received
of
an
animal
hurt
or
suffering
he
sends
after
it
chloroform
is
invariably
taken
along
in
order
that
if
expedient
the
creature
may
be
put
out
of
its
agony
at
once
this
refuge
is
at
lombard
street
and
there
is
a
temporary
home
where
dogs
are
boarded
at
south
street
in
out
of
animals
coming
under
the
care
of
the
association
were
cats
in
there
were
animals
relieved
and
disposed
of
while
the
superintendent
answered
police
calls
good
homes
are
found
for
both
dogs
and
cats
but
not
until
the
agent
is
sure
that
they
will
be
kindly
treated
in
miss
morris
eighth
annual
report
she
says
looking
back
to
the
formation
of
the
first
society
for
the
prevention
of
cruelty
to
animals
we
find
since
that
time
a
gradual
awakening
to
the
duties
man
owes
to
those
below
him
in
the
scale
of
animal
creation
the
titles
of
those
societies
and
their
objects
as
defined
by
their
charters
show
that
at
first
it
was
considered
sufficient
to
protect
animals
from
cruel
treatment
very
few
people
gave
thought
to
the
care
of
those
that
were
without
homes
now
many
are
beginning
to
think
of
the
evil
of
being
overrun
with
numbers
of
homeless
creatures
whose
sufferings
appeal
to
the
sympathies
of
the
humane
and
whose
noise
and
depredations
provoke
the
cruelty
of
the
hence
the
efforts
that
are
being
made
in
different
cities
to
establish
refuges
a
request
has
lately
been
received
from
montreal
asking
for
our
reports
as
it
is
proposed
to
found
a
home
for
animals
in
that
city
and
information
is
being
collected
in
relation
to
such
institutions
lady
marcus
beresford
has
succeeded
in
establishing
and
endowing
a
home
for
cats
in
englefield
green
windsor
park
she
has
made
a
specialty
of
angoras
and
her
collection
is
famous
queen
victoria
and
her
daughters
take
a
deep
interest
not
alone
in
finely
bred
cats
but
in
poor
and
homeless
waifs
as
well
her
royal
highness
in
fact
took
pains
to
write
the
london
some
years
ago
saying
she
would
be
very
glad
to
have
them
do
something
for
the
safety
and
protection
of
cats
are
so
generally
misunderstood
and
grossly
she
herself
sets
a
good
example
in
this
respect
and
when
her
courts
remove
from
one
royal
residence
to
another
her
cats
are
taken
with
her
there
is
a
movement
in
paris
too
to
provide
for
sick
and
homeless
cats
as
well
as
dogs
two
english
ladies
have
founded
a
hospital
near
asnières
where
ailing
pets
can
be
tended
in
illness
or
boarded
for
about
ten
cents
a
day
and
very
well
cared
for
their
pensioners
are
there
is
also
a
charity
ward
where
pauper
patients
are
received
and
tended
carefully
and
afterward
sold
or
given
away
to
reliable
people
oddly
this
sort
of
charity
was
begun
by
mademoiselle
claude
bernard
the
daughter
of
the
great
scientist
who
it
is
said
tortured
more
living
creatures
to
death
than
any
other
vivisection
became
a
passion
with
him
but
mademoiselle
bernard
is
atoning
for
her
father
cruelty
by
a
singular
devotion
to
animals
and
none
are
turned
from
her
gates
this
is
the
way
they
do
it
in
cairo
even
now
according
to
monsieur
prisse
the
distinguished
egyptologist
the
sultan
el
daher
beybars
who
reigned
in
egypt
and
syria
toward
of
the
hegira
and
is
compared
by
william
of
tripoli
to
nero
in
wickedness
and
to
caesar
in
bravery
had
a
peculiar
affection
for
cats
at
his
death
he
left
a
garden
the
orchard
situated
near
his
mosque
outside
cairo
for
the
support
of
homeless
cats
subsequently
the
field
was
sold
and
resold
several
times
by
the
administrator
and
purchasers
in
consequence
of
a
series
of
dilapidations
it
now
produces
a
nominal
rent
of
fifteen
piastres
a
year
which
with
certain
other
legacies
is
appropriated
to
the
maintenance
of
cats
the
kadi
who
is
the
official
administrator
of
all
pious
and
charitable
bequests
ordains
that
at
the
hour
of
afternoon
prayer
between
noon
and
sunset
a
daily
distribution
of
animals
entrails
and
refuse
meat
from
the
butchers
stalls
chopped
up
together
shall
be
made
to
the
cats
of
the
neighborhood
this
takes
place
in
the
outer
court
of
the
or
tribunal
and
a
curious
spectacle
may
then
be
seen
at
this
hour
all
the
terraces
near
the
mehkemeh
are
crowded
with
cats
they
come
jumping
from
house
to
house
across
the
narrow
cairo
streets
hurrying
for
their
share
they
slide
down
walls
and
glide
into
the
court
where
they
dispute
with
great
tenacity
and
much
growling
the
scanty
meal
so
sadly
out
of
proportion
to
the
number
of
guests
the
old
ones
clear
the
food
in
a
moment
the
young
ones
and
the
newcomers
too
timid
to
fight
for
their
chance
must
content
themselves
with
licking
the
ground
those
wanting
to
get
rid
of
cats
take
them
there
and
deposit
them
i
have
seen
whole
baskets
of
kittens
deposited
in
the
court
greatly
to
the
annoyance
of
the
neighbors
there
are
similar
customs
in
italy
and
switzerland
in
geneva
cats
prowl
about
the
streets
like
dogs
at
constantinople
the
people
charge
themselves
with
their
maintenance
and
feed
the
cats
who
come
to
their
doors
at
the
same
hour
every
day
for
their
meals
in
florence
a
cloister
near
lorenzo
church
serves
as
a
refuge
for
cats
it
is
an
ancient
and
curious
institution
but
i
am
unable
to
find
whether
it
is
maintained
by
the
city
or
by
private
charities
there
are
specimens
of
all
colors
sizes
and
kinds
and
any
one
who
wants
a
cat
has
but
to
go
there
and
ask
for
it
on
the
other
hand
the
owner
of
a
cat
who
is
unable
or
unwilling
to
keep
it
may
take
it
there
where
it
is
fed
and
well
treated
in
rome
they
have
a
commendable
system
of
caring
for
their
cats
at
a
certain
hour
butchers
men
drive
through
the
city
with
carts
well
stocked
with
cat
meat
they
utter
a
peculiar
cry
which
the
cats
recognize
and
come
hurrying
out
of
the
houses
for
their
allowances
which
are
paid
for
by
the
owners
at
a
certain
rate
per
month
in
boston
during
the
summer
of
a
firm
of
butchers
took
subscriptions
from
philanthropic
citizens
and
raised
enough
to
defray
the
expenses
of
feeding
the
cats
on
the
back
bay
where
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
the
citizens
are
all
wealthy
and
supposedly
humane
there
are
more
starving
cats
than
elsewhere
in
the
city
but
the
experiment
has
not
been
repeated
hospitals
for
sick
animals
are
no
new
thing
but
a
really
comfortable
home
for
cats
is
an
enterprise
in
which
many
a
woman
who
now
asks
despondently
what
she
can
do
in
this
overcrowded
world
to
earn
a
living
might
find
pleasant
and
profitable
a
most
worthy
charity
is
that
of
the
animal
rescue
league
in
boston
which
was
started
by
anna
harris
smith
in
she
put
a
call
in
the
newspapers
asking
those
who
were
interested
in
the
subject
to
attend
a
meeting
and
form
a
league
for
the
protection
and
care
of
lost
or
deserted
pets
the
response
was
immediate
and
generous
the
animal
rescue
league
was
formed
with
several
hundred
members
and
in
a
short
time
the
house
at
carver
street
was
rented
and
a
man
and
his
wife
put
in
charge
here
are
brought
both
cats
and
dogs
from
all
parts
of
boston
and
the
suburbs
where
they
are
sure
of
kind
treatment
and
care
if
they
are
diseased
they
are
immediately
put
out
of
existence
by
means
of
the
lethal
chamber
otherwise
they
are
kept
for
a
few
days
in
order
that
they
may
be
claimed
by
their
owners
if
lost
or
have
homes
found
for
them
whenever
it
is
possible
during
the
first
year
over
two
thousand
cats
were
cared
for
and
several
hundred
dogs
this
home
is
maintained
by
voluntary
contributions
and
by
the
annual
dues
of
subscribers
these
are
one
dollar
a
year
for
associate
members
and
five
dollars
for
active
members
it
is
an
excellent
charity
and
one
that
may
well
be
emulated
in
other
cities
there
are
several
cat
asylums
and
refuges
in
the
far
west
and
certainly
a
few
more
such
institutions
as
the
sheltering
home
at
brighton
or
the
morris
refuge
would
be
a
credit
to
a
country
how
better
than
by
applying
it
to
our
cats
can
we
demonstrate
the
truth
of
solomon
maxim
a
merciful
man
is
merciful
to
his
beast
chapter
xii
concerning
the
origin
of
cats
if
any
of
my
readers
hunger
and
thirst
for
information
concerning
the
descent
of
the
cat
through
marsupial
ancestors
and
mesozoic
mammals
to
the
generalized
placental
or
monodelphous
carnivora
of
let
them
consult
george
mivart
who
gives
altogether
the
most
comprehensive
and
exhaustive
scientific
study
to
the
cat
ever
published
and
whose
book
on
the
cat
is
an
excellent
work
for
the
earnest
beginner
in
the
study
of
biological
science
he
says
no
more
complete
example
can
be
found
of
a
perfectly
organized
living
being
than
that
supplied
by
the
highest
mammalian
family
on
the
whole
he
sums
up
it
seems
probable
that
the
mammalia
and
therefore
the
cat
descends
from
some
highly
developed
somewhat
batrachian
of
which
no
trace
has
been
found
away
back
in
the
eighth
century
of
the
hegira
an
arab
naturalist
gives
this
account
of
the
creation
of
the
cat
when
as
the
arab
relates
noah
made
a
couple
of
each
animal
to
enter
the
ark
his
companions
and
family
asked
security
can
you
give
us
and
the
other
animals
so
long
as
the
lion
dwells
with
us
on
this
narrow
vessel
then
noah
betook
himself
to
prayer
and
entreated
the
lord
god
immediately
fever
came
down
from
heaven
and
seized
upon
the
king
of
beasts
this
was
the
origin
of
fever
but
constituents
in
noah
time
as
now
were
ungrateful
and
no
sooner
was
the
lion
disposed
of
than
the
mouse
was
discovered
to
be
an
object
of
suspicion
they
complained
that
there
would
be
no
safety
for
provisions
or
clothing
and
so
noah
renewed
his
supplication
to
the
most
high
the
lion
sneezed
and
a
cat
ran
out
of
his
nostrils
from
that
time
the
mouse
has
been
timid
and
has
hidden
in
holes
in
the
egyptian
gallery
of
the
british
museum
there
is
an
excellent
painting
of
a
tabby
cat
assisting
a
man
to
capture
birds
hieroglyphic
inscriptions
as
far
back
as
mention
the
cat
and
there
is
at
leyden
a
tablet
of
the
eighteenth
or
nineteenth
dynasty
with
a
cat
seated
under
a
chair
a
temple
at
is
dedicated
to
pasht
or
bubastis
the
goddess
of
cats
which
is
as
old
as
thothmes
iv
of
the
eighteenth
dynasty
and
the
cat
appears
in
written
rituals
of
that
dynasty
herodotus
tells
of
the
almost
superstitious
reverence
which
dwellers
along
the
nile
felt
for
the
cat
and
gravely
states
that
when
one
died
a
natural
death
in
any
house
the
inmates
shaved
their
eyebrows
as
a
token
of
grief
also
that
in
case
of
a
fire
the
first
thing
they
saved
was
the
household
cat
fortunate
pussies
it
is
thought
that
cats
were
introduced
into
greece
from
egypt
although
professor
rolleston
of
cambridge
university
believes
the
grecian
pet
cat
to
have
been
the
marten
yet
why
should
he
is
not
a
soft
maltese
or
tabby
as
attractive
the
idea
that
cats
were
domesticated
in
western
europe
by
the
crusaders
is
thought
to
be
erroneous
but
pet
cats
were
often
found
in
nunneries
in
the
middle
ages
and
pope
gregory
the
great
toward
the
end
of
the
sixth
century
had
a
pet
cat
of
which
he
was
very
fond
an
old
writer
says
a
favorite
cat
sometimes
accompanied
the
egyptians
on
these
occasions
of
sport
and
the
artist
of
that
day
intends
to
show
us
by
the
exactness
with
which
he
represents
her
seizing
her
prey
that
cats
were
trained
to
hunt
and
carry
there
are
old
egyptian
paintings
representing
sporting
scenes
along
the
nile
where
the
cats
plunge
into
the
water
of
the
marshes
to
retrieve
and
carry
game
while
plenty
of
mural
paintings
show
them
sitting
under
the
of
the
mistress
of
the
house
modern
naturalists
however
claim
a
radical
difference
between
those
old
egyptian
retrieving
cats
and
our
pussies
there
are
no
records
of
cats
between
that
period
in
egypt
about
and
when
they
seem
to
have
become
acclimated
in
greece
and
rome
there
is
in
the
bordeaux
museum
an
ancient
picture
of
a
young
girl
holding
a
cat
on
a
tomb
of
the
epoch
and
cats
appeared
in
the
heraldry
of
that
date
but
writers
of
those
ages
speak
rather
slightingly
of
them
then
for
centuries
the
cat
was
looked
upon
as
a
diabolic
creature
fit
company
for
witches
why
says
balthazar
bekker
in
the
seventeenth
century
is
a
cat
always
found
among
the
belongings
of
witches
when
according
to
the
sacred
book
and
apocalypse
in
particular
it
is
the
dog
not
a
feline
animal
that
consorts
with
the
sorcerers
in
russia
even
yet
the
common
people
believe
that
black
cats
become
devils
at
the
end
of
seven
years
and
in
many
parts
of
southern
europe
they
are
still
supposed
to
be
serving
apprenticeship
as
witches
in
sicily
the
peasants
are
sure
that
if
a
black
cat
lives
with
seven
masters
the
soul
of
the
seventh
will
surely
accompany
him
back
to
the
dominion
of
hades
in
brittany
there
is
a
dreadful
tale
of
cats
that
dance
with
unholy
glee
around
the
crucifix
while
their
king
is
being
put
to
death
cats
figure
in
norwegian
too
as
witches
and
picturesque
incumbents
of
houses
and
nocturnal
revels
and
even
there
is
a
legend
in
westminster
to
the
effect
that
the
dissipated
cats
of
that
region
indulge
in
a
most
disreputable
revel
in
some
country
house
and
that
is
why
they
look
so
forlorn
and
altogether
undone
by
daylight
a
canon
enacted
in
england
in
forbade
any
abbess
or
nun
to
use
more
costly
fur
than
that
of
lambs
or
cats
and
it
is
proved
that
was
at
that
time
commonly
used
for
trimming
dresses
the
cat
was
probably
for
that
reason
an
object
of
chase
in
royal
forests
and
a
license
is
still
in
existence
from
richard
ii
to
the
abbot
of
peterborough
and
dated
granting
liberty
to
hunt
cats
this
was
probably
the
wild
cat
however
which
was
not
the
same
as
the
domestic
footnote
these
are
among
the
laws
supposedly
enacted
by
hoel
dha
howell
the
good
sometime
between
and
the
vendotian
code
xi
the
worth
of
a
cat
and
her
teithi
qualities
this
is
the
worth
of
a
kitten
from
the
night
it
is
kittened
until
it
shall
open
its
eyes
is
one
penny
and
from
that
time
until
it
shall
kill
mice
two
pence
and
after
it
shall
kill
mice
four
legal
pence
and
so
it
shall
always
remain
her
teithe
are
to
see
to
hear
to
kill
mice
and
to
have
her
claws
this
is
the
dimentian
code
xxxii
of
cats
the
worth
of
a
cat
that
is
killed
or
stolen
its
head
to
be
put
downward
upon
a
clean
even
floor
with
its
tail
lifted
upward
and
thus
suspended
whilst
wheat
is
poured
about
it
until
the
top
of
its
tail
be
covered
and
that
is
to
be
its
worth
if
the
corn
can
not
be
had
then
a
milch
sheep
with
a
lamb
and
its
wool
is
its
value
if
it
be
a
cat
that
guards
the
king
barn
the
worth
of
a
common
cat
is
four
legal
pence
the
teithi
of
a
cat
and
of
every
animal
upon
the
milk
of
which
people
do
not
feed
is
the
third
part
of
its
worth
or
the
worth
of
its
litter
whosoever
shall
sell
a
cat
cath
is
to
answer
that
she
devour
not
her
kittens
and
that
she
have
ears
teeth
eyes
and
nails
and
be
a
good
mouser
the
gwentian
code
begins
in
the
same
way
but
says
that
it
be
perfect
of
ear
perfect
of
eye
perfect
of
teeth
perfect
of
tail
perfect
of
claw
and
without
marks
of
fire
and
if
the
cat
fall
short
in
any
of
these
particulars
a
third
of
her
price
had
to
be
refunded
as
to
the
fire
in
case
her
fur
had
been
singed
the
rats
could
detect
her
by
the
odor
and
her
qualities
as
a
mouser
were
thus
injured
and
then
it
goes
on
to
say
that
the
teithi
and
the
legal
worth
of
a
cat
are
coequal
a
pound
is
the
worth
of
a
pet
animal
of
the
king
the
pet
animal
of
a
breyer
brewer
is
six
score
pence
in
value
the
pet
animal
of
a
taoog
is
a
curt
penny
in
value
in
the
chapter
section
we
find
that
there
are
three
animals
whose
tails
eyes
and
lives
are
of
the
same
value
a
calf
a
filly
for
common
work
and
a
cat
except
the
cat
which
shall
watch
the
barn
in
which
case
she
was
more
valuable
another
old
welsh
law
says
three
animals
reach
their
worth
in
a
year
a
sheep
a
cat
and
a
cur
this
is
a
complement
of
the
legal
hamlet
nine
buildings
one
plough
one
kiln
one
churn
and
one
cat
one
cock
one
bull
and
one
herdsman
in
order
that
there
might
be
no
mistake
in
regard
to
the
cat
a
rough
sketch
of
puss
is
given
in
the
mss
of
the
laws
that
cats
even
in
the
middle
ages
were
thought
much
more
highly
of
in
great
britain
than
on
the
continent
is
proved
by
the
fact
that
the
laws
there
imposed
a
heavy
fine
on
the
fine
being
as
much
wheat
as
would
serve
to
bury
the
cat
when
he
was
held
up
by
the
tip
of
the
tail
with
his
nose
on
the
ground
so
that
pet
cats
stood
a
fairly
good
chance
in
those
days
one
of
the
good
things
remembered
of
louis
xiii
is
that
he
interceded
as
dauphin
with
henri
iv
for
the
lives
of
the
cats
about
to
be
burned
at
the
festival
on
john
day
nowadays
there
is
a
current
superstition
that
a
black
cat
brings
good
luck
to
a
house
but
in
the
middle
ages
they
believed
that
the
devil
borrowed
the
form
of
a
black
cat
when
he
wanted
to
torment
or
get
control
of
his
victims
there
are
plenty
of
old
traditions
about
cats
having
spoken
to
human
beings
and
been
kicked
or
struck
or
burned
by
them
in
return
and
invariably
these
tales
tell
us
those
who
are
so
bespoken
meet
some
one
the
next
day
with
plain
marks
of
the
injury
they
had
inflicted
on
the
froward
cat
which
was
sure
evidence
of
witchery
and
sorcery
doubtless
full
many
a
human
being
has
been
put
to
death
in
times
past
on
no
stronger
evidence
of
being
a
witch
humanity
did
not
come
to
the
rescue
of
the
cat
and
bring
her
out
from
the
shadow
of
ignominy
that
hung
over
her
in
mediaeval
times
until
when
an
interdict
was
issued
in
flanders
prohibiting
the
festive
ceremony
of
throwing
cats
from
the
high
tower
of
ypres
on
wednesdays
of
the
second
week
in
lent
and
from
that

these

all
the

chapter
xiii
concerning
varieties
of
cats
few
people
realize
how
many
kinds
of
cats
there
are
the
fashionable
world
begins
to
discuss
cats
technically
and
understand
their
various
points
of
excellence
the
lord
mayor
chain
the
dutch
rabbit
markings
and
similar
features
are
understood
by
more
cat
fanciers
than
a
few
years
ago
but
until
within
that
time
it
is
doubtful
if
the
number
of
people
who
knew
the
difference
between
the
angora
and
the
persian
in
this
country
amounted
to
a
hundred
it
is
but
a
few
years
since
the
craze
for
the
angora
cat
started
these
cats
have
been
fashionable
pets
in
england
for
some
years
back
and
now
america
begins
to
understand
their
value
and
the
principles
of
breeding
them
today
there
are
as
handsome
animals
in
the
united
states
as
can
be
found
abroad
the
demand
for
animals
with
a
pedigree
is
greatly
increasing
and
society
people
are
beginning
to
understand
the
fine
points
of
the
thoroughbred
the
angora
cat
as
its
name
indicates
comes
from
angora
in
western
asia
the
province
that
is
celebrated
for
its
goats
with
long
hair
of
fine
quality
in
fact
the
hair
under
the
angora
cat
body
often
resembles
the
finest
of
the
angora
goatskins
angora
cats
are
favorites
with
the
turks
and
armenians
and
exist
in
many
colors
especially
since
they
have
been
more
carefully
bred
they
vary
in
form
color
and
disposition
and
also
in
the
quality
of
their
hair
the
standard
calls
for
a
small
head
with
not
too
long
a
nose
large
eyes
that
should
harmonize
in
color
with
the
fur
small
pointed
ears
with
a
tuft
of
hair
at
the
apex
and
a
very
full
fluffy
mane
around
the
neck
this
mane
is
known
as
the
lord
mayor
chain
the
body
is
longer
than
that
of
the
ordinary
cat
in
proportion
to
its
size
and
is
extremely
graceful
and
covered
with
long
silky
hair
which
is
crinkly
like
that
of
the
angora
goat
this
hair
should
be
as
fine
as
possible
and
not
woolly
the
legs
are
of
a
moderate
length
but
look
short
on
account
of
the
length
of
hair
on
the
body
little
tufts
of
hair
growing
between
the
toes
indicate
high
breeding
the
angora
cat
in
good
condition
is
one
of
the
most
beautiful
and
elegant
creatures
in
the
world
and
few
can
resist
its
charm
the
tail
is
long
and
like
an
ostrich
plume
it
is
usually
carried
when
the
cat
is
in
good
spirits
straight
up
with
the
end
waving
over
toward
one
side
the
tail
of
the
angora
serves
as
a
barometer
of
its
bodily
and
mental
condition
if
the
cat
is
ill
or
frightened
the
tail
droops
and
sometimes
trails
on
the
ground
but
when
she
is
in
good
spirits
playing
about
the
house
or
grounds
it
waves
like
a
great
plume
and
is
exceedingly
handsome
the
suppleness
of
the
angora
tail
is
also
a
mark
of
fine
breeding
a
highbred
angora
will
allow
its
tail
to
be
doubled
or
twisted
without
apparent
notice
of
the
performance
the
angora
does
not
reach
its
prime
until
about
two
years
before
that
time
its
head
and
body
are
not
sufficiently
developed
to
give
the
full
beauty
and
grace
of
the
animal
as
a
rule
the
angora
is
of
good
disposition
although
the
females
are
apt
to
be
exceedingly
nervous
they
are
sociable
and
docile
although
fond
of
roaming
about
especially
if
allowed
to
run
loose
as
a
rule
they
do
not
possess
the
keen
intelligence
of
the
ordinary
family
cat
but
their
great
beauty
and
their
cleanly
and
affectionate
habits
make
them
favorites
with
fashionable
people
the
proper
breeding
of
the
angora
cat
is
a
regular
science
of
the
colors
of
the
angoras
the
blue
or
maltese
is
a
favorite
and
rather
common
especially
when
mixed
with
white
the
white
angora
is
extraordinarily
beautiful
and
brings
a
high
price
when
it
has
blue
eyes
and
all
its
points
are
equally
good
the
orange
or
yellow
and
the
black
with
amber
eyes
are
also
prize
winners
there
are
the
tigers
also
the
brown
tabby
and
the
orange
and
white
mixed
colors
are
more
common
than
solid
ones
the
cat
of
three
colors
and
well
mottled
being
considered
particularly
desirable
the
persian
cat
differs
from
the
angora
in
the
quality
of
its
fur
although
the
ordinary
observer
sees
little
difference
between
them
all
the
cats
originated
from
the
indian
bengalese
thibetan
and
other
wild
cats
of
asia
and
russia
the
persian
cat
of
very
great
value
is
all
black
with
a
very
fluffy
frill
or
lord
mayor
chain
and
orange
eyes
next
to
him
comes
a
light
slate
or
blue
persian
with
yellow
eyes
the
fur
of
the
persian
cat
is
much
more
woolly
than
that
of
the
angora
and
sometimes
in
hot
weather
mats
badly
the
difference
between
a
persian
and
an
angora
can
usually
be
told
by
an
amateur
by
drawing
the
tail
between
the
thumb
and
first
finger
the
angora
tail
comes
out
thin
silky
and
narrow
although
it
immediately
fluffs
up
the
persian
tail
does
not
compress
itself
readily
into
a
small
space
the
persian
cat
head
is
larger
its
ears
are
less
pointed
although
it
should
have
the
tuft
at
the
end
and
the
long
hair
inside
it
is
usually
larger
in
body
and
apparently
stronger
made
although
slender
and
elegant
in
appearance
with
small
bones
and
graceful
in
movement
the
colors
vary
as
with
the
angora
except
that
the
and
the
tabby
do
not
so
frequently
appear
the
temper
is
usually
less
reliable
and
the
intelligence
less
keen
than
the
angora
the
russian
pet
is
much
less
common
even
than
the
persian
and
angora
it
is
fond
of
cold
weather
and
its
fur
is
denser
indicating
that
it
has
been
used
to
colder
regions
many
of
the
cats
that
we
see
are
crosses
of
angora
and
persian
or
angora
and
russian
so
that
it
is
extremely
difficult
for
the
amateur
to
know
a
thoroughbred
cat
which
has
not
been
mixed
with
other
varieties
there
is
also
a
fine
cat
coming
from
russia
usually
frederick
monroe
of
chicago
owns
a
very
handsome
blue
and
white
one
in
pegu
siam
and
burmah
there
is
a
race
of
cats
known
as
the
malay
cat
with
tails
only
half
the
ordinary
length
and
often
contorted
into
a
sort
of
a
knot
that
can
not
be
straightened
after
the
fashion
of
the
pug
dog
or
ordinary
pig
there
is
another
cat
known
as
the
mombas
a
native
of
the
west
coast
of
africa
and
covered
with
stiff
bristling
hair
paraguay
cats
are
only
as
big
as
our
ordinary
cat
and
are
found
along
the
western
coast
of
south
america
even
as
far
north
as
mexico
the
royal
cat
of
siam
is
a
cat
yet
widely
different
from
other
varieties
they
are
extremely
pretty
with
blue
or
eyes
by
day
which
grow
brilliant
at
night
these
cats
also
frequently
have
the
kink
in
the
tail
and
sometimes
a
strong
animal
odor
although
this
is
not
disagreeable
the
head
is
rather
longer
than
the
ordinary
cat
tapering
off
sharply
toward
the
muzzle
the
forehead
flat
and
receding
and
the
eyes
more
slanting
toward
the
nose
than
the
american
cat
the
form
should
be
slender
graceful
and
delicately
made
the
body
long
the
tail
very
thin
and
rather
short
the
legs
short
and
slender
and
the
feet
oval
the
body
is
of
a
bright
uniform
color
and
the
legs
feet
and
tail
are
usually
black
the
manx
cat
is
considered
by
many
people
as
a
natural
curiosity
it
differs
from
the
ordinary
domestic
cat
but
little
except
in
the
absence
of
a
tail
or
even
an
apology
for
one
the
hind
legs
are
thicker
and
rather
longer
than
the
ordinary
cat
and
it
runs
more
like
a
hare
it
is
not
a
graceful
object
when
seen
from
behind
but
it
is
an
affectionate
creature
with
considerable
intelligence
the
manx
cat
came
from
the
isle
of
man
originally
and
is
a
distinct
breed
manx
cats
have
tails
from
one
to
a
few
inches
long
but
these
are
crosses
of
the
manx
and
the
ordinary
cat
in
the
crimea
is
found
another
kind
of
cat
which
has
no
tail
the
cats
known
as
the
celebrated
orange
cats
of
venice
are
probably
descendants
of
the
old
egyptian
cat
and
are
of
varying
shades
of
yellow
sometimes
deepening
into
a
sandy
color
which
is
almost
red
there
are
obscure
stripes
on
the
body
which
become
more
distinct
on
the
limbs
the
tail
is
more
or
less
ringed
toward
its
termination
there
has
been
a
newspaper
paragraph
floating
about
stating
that
a
prize
of
several
thousand
dollars
had
been
offered
in
england
for
a
male
cat
this
is
probably
not
true
as
a
smith
exhibited
a
at
the
crystal
palace
show
of
several
and
white
toms
have
been
exhibited
since
and
one
of
these
has
taken
nine
first
prizes
at
the
crystal
palace
show
but
the
is
extremely
rare
the
real
is
not
a
striped
tiger
nor
a
tabby
it
has
three
colors
usually
black
yellow
and
red
or
brown
but
these
appear
in
patches
rather
than
stripes
it
is
said
that
the
cat
is
common
in
egypt
and
the
south
of
europe
it
comes
from
a
different
stock
than
the
ordinary
cat
the
texture
of
the
hair
being
different
as
well
as
the
color
the
and
white
cat
is
much
more
common
and
is
the
product
of
a
cross
between
a
tortoise
shell
and
a
solid
color
cat
in
this
case
the
hair
is
usually
coarser
and
the
tail
thicker
than
in
the
ordinary
cat
among
cat
fanciers
there
is
a
distinctive
variety
known
as
the
tabby
as
the
tabby
cat
is
one
of
the
varieties
of
striped
or
spotted
cats
having
markings
broad
or
narrow
of
bands
of
black
on
a
dark
tan
or
gray
ground
the
cat
would
have
both
stripes
and
patches
of
color
of
the
tabbies
there
are
brown
tabbies
silver
tabbies
and
red
tabbies
it
is
said
that
the
red
tabby
is
as
scarce
as
the
the
ordinary
observer
considers
the
brown
tabby
with
white
markings
as
much
the
handsomest
of
the
tabbies
but
fanciers
and
judges
do
not
agree
with
him
the
cats
having
narrow
bands
and
spots
being
the
ones
to
take
prizes
the
word
tabby
according
to
harrison
weir
was
derived
from
a
kind
of
taffeta
or
ribbed
silk
which
used
to
be
called
tabby
silk
other
authorities
state
that
tabby
cats
got
their
name
from
atab
a
street
in
bagdad
but
as
this
street
was
famous
for
its
watered
silks
perhaps
the
same
reason
holds
the
used
to
be
called
in
england
the
calimanco
in
america
it
is
sometimes
called
the
calico
cat
the
red
tabby
is
of
a
deep
reddish
or
yellow
brown
with
a
tail
orange
or
yellow
eyes
and
pink
cushions
to
the
feet
the
brown
tabby
is
orange
brown
with
black
lips
brown
whiskers
black
feet
black
pads
long
tail
greenish
orange
eyes
and
red
nose
bordered
with
black
the
spotted
tabby
must
have
no
bands
at
all
it
must
be
brown
red
or
yellow
with
black
spots
in
the
brown
tabby
the
feet
and
pads
are
black
in
the
yellow
and
red
the
feet
and
pads
are
pink
the
spotted
cat
sometimes
resembles
a
leopard
while
the
banded
tabby
resembles
more
the
tiger
some
of
the
spotted
tabbies
are
extremely
handsome
and
came
originally
from
a
cross
between
the
ordinary
cat
and
the
wild
cat
cats
are
entirely
of
one
color
which
may
vary
in
different
cats
but
must
never
be
mixed
in
the
same
cat
nor
even
shaded
into
a
lighter
tone
on
the
animal
and
whether
this
color
be
black
blue
red
or
yellow
the
cat
should
have
a
rich
deep
tint
of
course
the
white
cat
is
the
handsomest
of
all
one
of
the
peculiarities
of
this
white
cat
is
that
it
is
apt
to
be
deaf
the
most
valuable
white
cats
whether
long
or
short
haired
have
blue
eyes
sometimes
they
have
one
blue
eye
and
one
green
or
yellow
which
gives
a
comical
effect
and
detracts
from
their
value
by
the
way
cats
are
not
unknown
the
best
white
cats
have
a
yellowish
white
tint
instead
of
grayish
white
as
the
latter
have
a
coarser
quality
of
fur
the
cat
is
thought
by
many
to
be
the
most
desirable
the
true
black
cat
should
have
a
uniform
intensely
black
coat
velvety
and
extremely
glossy
the
eyes
should
be
round
and
full
and
of
a
brilliant
amber
the
nose
and
pads
of
the
feet
should
be
and
the
tail
long
and
tapering
it
is
difficult
to
find
a
black
cat
without
a
white
hair
as
usually
there
are
a
few
under
the
chin
or
on
the
belly
the
blue
cat
is
the
one
ordinarily
known
in
this
country
as
the
dark
maltese
there
is
a
tradition
that
it
came
from
the
island
of
malta
many
people
do
not
consider
it
a
distinct
breed
but
think
it
a
variety
of
the
black
cat
it
is
known
sometimes
as
the
archangel
sometimes
as
the
russian
blue
the
spanish
blue
the
chartreuse
blue
but
more
commonly
in
this
country
as
the
maltese
when
it
is
of
a
deep
bluish
color
or
of
the
soft
maltese
without
stripes
it
is
extremely
handsome
the
most
desirable
are
the
bluish
ones
with
soft
fur
like
sealskin
the
nose
and
pads
of
the
feet
are
dark
and
the
eyes
are
orange
yellow
the
maltese
and
white
cat
when
well
marked
is
extremely
handsome
and
there
is
no
prettier
kitten
than
the
maltese
and
white
the
black
and
white
yellow
and
white
blue
and
white
and
in
fact
any
and
white
cat
is
a
mixture
of
the
other
breeds
if
well
marked
they
are
extremely
handsome
and
are
usually
bright
and
intelligent
the
solid
gray
cat
is
very
rare
it
is
in
fact
a
tabby
without
the
black
stripes
or
spots
in
australia
new
zealand
and
new
guinea
there
used
to
be
no
cat
of
any
kind
the
siamese
cat
has
been
imported
to
australia
and
some
authorities
claim
that
the
cats
known
in
this
country
as
australian
cats
are
of
siamese
origin
madagascar
is
a
catless
region
there
is
in
this
country
a
variety
known
as
the
coon
cat
which
is
handsome
especially
in
the
solid
black
its
native
home
is
in
maine
and
it
is
thought
by
many
to
have
originated
with
the
ordinary
cat
and
the
raccoon
it
grows
somewhat
larger
than
the
ordinary
cat
with
thick
woolly
fur
and
an
extremely
bushy
tail
it
is
fond
of
outdoor
life
and
when
kept
as
a
pet
must
be
allowed
to
run
out
of
doors
or
it
is
apt
to
become
so
savage
and
disagreeable
that
nothing
can
be
done
with
it
when
it
is
allowed
its
freedom
however
it
becomes
affectionate
intelligent
and
is
usually
a
handsome
cat
the
term
dutch
rabbit
markings
refers
to
the
white
markings
on
the
cat
of
two
or
three
colors
evidently
the
cats
themselves
understand
the
value
of
dutch
rabbit
markings
as
one
which
has
them
is
invariably
proud
of
them
a
cat
that
has
white
mittens
for
instance
is
often
inordinately
vain
and
keeps
them
in
the
most
immaculate
state
of
cleanliness
chapter
xiv
concerning
cat
language
montaigne
it
was
who
said
we
have
some
intelligence
of
their
senses
so
have
also
the
beasts
of
ours
in
much
the
same
measure
they
flatter
us
menace
us
need
us
and
we
them
it
is
manifestly
evident
that
there
is
among
them
a
full
and
entire
communication
and
that
they
understand
each
other
that
this
applies
to
cats
is
certainly
true
did
you
ever
notice
how
a
mother
cat
talks
to
her
children
and
simply
by
the
utterances
of
her
voice
induces
them
to
abandon
their
play
and
go
with
her
sometimes
with
the
greatest
reluctance
to
some
place
that
suited
her
whim
or
her
wisdom
dupont
de
nemours
a
naturalist
of
the
eighteenth
century
made
himself
ridiculous
in
the
eyes
of
his
compatriots
by
seeking
to
penetrate
the
mysteries
of
animal
language
those
who
utter
sounds
he
affirmed
attach
significance
to
them
their
fellows
do
the
same
and
those
sounds
originally
inspired
by
passion
and
repeated
under
similar
recurrent
circumstances
become
the
abiding
expressions
of
the
passions
that
gave
rise
to
them
fortified
by
this
theory
he
devoted
a
couple
of
years
to
the
study
of
crow
language
and
made
himself
ridiculous
in
the
eyes
of
his
adversaries
by
attempting
to
translate
a
nightingale
song
chateaubriand
was
much
interested
in
dupont
de
nemours
researches
into
the
language
of
cats
its
claws
says
the
latter
and
the
power
of
climbing
trees
which
its
claws
give
it
furnish
the
cat
with
resources
of
experience
and
ideas
denied
the
dog
the
cat
also
has
the
advantage
of
a
language
which
has
the
same
vowels
as
pronounced
by
the
dog
and
with
six
consonants
in
addition
n
g
h
and
consequently
the
cat
has
a
greater
number
of
words
these
two
causes
the
finer
structure
of
its
paws
and
the
larger
scope
of
oral
language
endow
the
solitary
cat
with
greater
cunning
and
skill
as
a
hunter
than
the
dog
abbé
galiani
also
says
for
centuries
cats
have
been
reared
but
i
do
not
find
they
have
ever
been
really
studied
i
have
a
male
and
a
female
cat
i
have
cut
them
off
from
all
communication
with
cats
outside
the
house
and
closely
observe
their
proceedings
during
their
courtship
they
never
once
miowed
the
miow
therefore
is
not
the
language
of
love
but
rather
the
call
of
the
absent
another
positive
discovery
i
have
made
is
that
the
voice
of
the
male
is
entirely
different
from
that
of
the
female
as
it
should
be
i
am
sure
there
are
more
than
twenty
different
inflections
in
the
language
of
cats
and
there
is
really
a
for
they
always
employ
the
same
sound
to
express
the
same
thing
i
heartily
concur
with
him
and
in
addition
have
often
noticed
the
wide
difference
between
the
voice
and
manner
of
expression
of
the
gelded
cat
and
the
ordinary
tom
the
former
has
a
thin
high
voice
with
much
smaller
vocabulary
as
a
rule
the
gelded
cat
does
not
mew
to
make
known
his
wants
but
employs
his
voice
for
conversational
purposes
a
mother
cat
talks
much
more
than
any
other
and
more
when
she
has
small
kittens
than
at
other
times
cat
language
has
been
reduced
to
etymology
in
several
tongues
in
arabia
their
speech
is
called
naoua
in
chinese
ming
in
greek
larungizein
in
sanscrit
madj
vid
bid
in
german
miauen
in
french
miauler
and
in
english
mew
or
miaouw
perhaps
if
professor
garner
had
turned
his
attention
to
cat
language
instead
of
monkeys
we
would
know
more
about
it
but
a
french
professor
alphonse
léon
grimaldi
of
paris
claims
that
cats
can
talk
as
readily
as
human
beings
and
that
he
has
learned
their
language
so
as
to
be
able
to
converse
with
them
to
some
extent
grimaldi
goes
even
further
he
not
only
says
that
he
knows
such
a
language
but
he
states
definitely
that
there
are
about
six
hundred
words
in
it
that
it
is
more
like
modern
chinese
than
anything
else
and
to
prove
this
contention
gives
a
small
vocabulary
most
of
us
would
prefer
to
accept
george
mivart
conclusions
that
the
difference
between
all
animals
and
human
beings
is
that
while
they
have
some
means
of
communication
or
language
we
only
have
the
gift
of
speech
among
the
eighteen
distinct
active
powers
which
he
attributes
to
the
cat
he
quotes
powers
of
pleasurable
or
painful
excitement
on
the
occurrence
of
with
imaginations
and
a
power
of
expressing
feelings
by
sounds
or
gestures
which
may
affect
other
individuals
again
he
says
the
cat
has
a
language
of
sounds
and
gestures
to
express
its
feelings
and
emotions
so
have
we
but
we
have
further
which
neither
the
cat
nor
the
bird
nor
the
beast
has
a
language
and
gestures
to
express
our
thoughts
the
sum
of
his
conclusions
seems
to
be
that
while
the
cat
has
a
most
highly
developed
nervous
system
and
much
of
what
is
known
as
animal
intelligence
it
is
not
a
human
intelligence
not
consciousness
but
elsewhere
george
mivart
doubts
if
a
cat
distinguishes
odors
as
such
perhaps
a
cat
starts
for
the
kitchen
the
instant
he
smells
meat
because
of
the
mental
association
of
the
scent
with
the
gratification
of
hunger
but
why
pray
tell
do
some
cats
evince
such
delight
in
delicate
perfumes
our
own
pomp
the
first
for
instance
had
a
most
demonstrative
fondness
for
violets
and
liked
the
scent
of
all
flowers
one
winter
i
used
to
bring
home
a
bunch
of
parma
or
russian
violets
every
day
or
two
and
put
them
in
a
small
glass
bowl
of
water
it
soon
became
necessary
to
put
them
on
the
highest
shelf
in
the
room
and
even
then
pompey
would
find
them
often
have
i
placed
them
on
the
piano
and
a
few
minutes
later
seen
him
enter
the
room
lift
his
nose
give
a
few
sniffs
and
then
go
straight
to
the
piano
bury
his
nose
in
the
violets
and
hold
it
there
in
perfect
ecstacy
and
usually
wherever
they
were
placed
the
bunch
was
found
the
next
morning
on
the
floor
where
pompey
had
carried
the
violets
and
holding
them
between
his
paws
for
a
time
had
surfeited
himself
with
their
delicious
fragrance
still
i
am
not
prepared
to
say
that
pompey
had
any
word
for
violets
or
for
anything
else
that
ministered
to
his
delight
it
was
enough
for
him
to
be
happy
and
he
had
better
ways
of
expressing
it
cats
do
have
the
power
of
making
people
understand
what
they
want
done
but
so
far
as
my
knowledge
of
them
goes
some
of
the
most
intelligent
ones
talk
the
least
thomas
erastus
whose
intelligence
sometimes
amounts
to
a
knowledge
that
seems
almost
uncanny
seldom
utters
a
sound
there
is
or
was
a
black
cat
belonging
to
the
city
jail
of
a
californian
town
named
inspector
byrnes
because
of
his
remarkable
assistance
to
the
police
force
when
one
night
a
prisoner
in
the
jail
had
stuffed
the
cracks
to
his
cell
with
straw
and
turned
on
the
gas
in
an
attempt
to
commit
suicide
inspector
byrnes
hurried
off
and
notified
the
night
keeper
that
something
was
wrong
and
induced
him
to
go
to
the
cell
in
time
to
save
the
prisoner
life
he
once
notified
the
police
when
a
fire
broke
out
on
the
premises
and
at
another
time
made
such
a
fuss
that
they
followed
him
to
discover
a
woman
trying
to
hang
herself
again
some
of
the
prisoners
plotted
to
escape
and
the
cat
crawled
through
the
hole
they
had
filed
and
called
the
attention
to
it
in
fact
there
was
no
doubt
that
inspector
byrnes
considered
himself
assistant
warden
at
the
jail
and
he
did
not
waste
much
time
in
talk
either
the
pretty
lady
had
ways
of
her
own
to
make
us
know
when
things
were
wrong
in
the
household
although
she
used
to
utter
a
great
many
sounds
either
of
pleasure
or
perturbation
which
we
came
to
understand
i
remember
one
morning
when
my
sister
was
ill
upstairs
that
i
had
breakfasted
and
sat
down
to
read
my
morning
mail
when
the
pretty
lady
came
uttering
sounds
that
denoted
dissatisfaction
with
matters
somewhere
i
was
busy
and
at
first
paid
no
attention
to
her
but
she
grew
more
persistent
so
that
i
finally
laid
down
my
letters
and
asked
what
is
it
puss
have
you
had
breakfast
enough
i
went
out
to
the
kitchen
and
she
followed
all
the
time
protesting
articulately
she
would
not
touch
the
meat
i
offered
but
evidently
wanted
something
entirely
different
just
then
my
sister
came
down
and
said
i
wish
you
would
go
up
and
see
she
is
suffering
terribly
and
i
do
know
what
to
do
for
her
at
that
the
pretty
lady
led
the
way
into
the
hall
and
up
the
stairs
pausing
at
every
third
step
to
make
sure
i
was
following
and
leading
me
straight
to
my
sister
then
she
settled
herself
calmly
on
the
and
closed
her
eyes
as
though
the
whole
affair
was
no
concern
of
hers
afterward
my
sister
said
that
when
the
pain
became
almost
unendurable
so
that
she
tossed
about
and
groaned
the
pretty
lady
came
close
to
her
face
and
talked
to
her
just
as
she
did
to
her
kittens
when
they
were
in
distress
showing
plainly
that
she
sympathized
with
and
would
help
her
when
she
found
it
impossible
to
do
this
she
hurried
down
to
me
and
then
having
got
me
actually
up
to
my
sister
bedside
she
threw
off
her
own
burden
of
anxiety
and
settled
into
her
usual
calm
content
my
goliath
is
at
the
helm
now
she
expressed
by
her
attitude
and
the
world
is
sure
to
go
right
a
little
longer
while
i
take
a
nap
