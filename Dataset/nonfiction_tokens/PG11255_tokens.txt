has
been
a

and
a
servant
in
five
generations
of
the
parks
family
her
mother
liza
with
a
group
of
five
negroes
was
sold
into
slavery
to
john
parks
in
tennessee
about
when
my
mother
master
come
to
arkansas
about
looking
for
a
country
residence
he
bought
what
was
known
as
the
old
kidd
place
on
the
old
wire
road
which
was
one
of
the
stage
coach
stops
i
was
about
one
year
old
when
we
came
we
had
a
big
house
and
many
times
passengers
would
stay
several
days
and
wait
for
the
next
stage
to
come
by
it
was
then
that
i
earned
my
first
money
i
must
have
been
about
six
or
seven
years
old
one
of
mr
parks
daughters
was
about
one
and
a
half
years
older
than
i
was
we
had
a
play
house
back
of
the
fireplace
chimney
we
did
have
many
toys
maybe
a
doll
made
of
a
corn
cob
with
a
dress
made
from
scraps
and
a
head
made
from
a
roll
of
scraps
we
were
playing
church
miss
fannie
was
the
preacher
and
i
was
the
audience
we
were
singing
jesus
my
all
to
heaven
is
gone
when
we
were
half
way
through
with
our
song
we
discovered
that
the
passengers
from
the
stage
coach
had
stopped
to
listen
we
were
so
frightened
at
our
audience
that
we
both
ran
but
we
were
coaxed
to
come
back
for
a
dime
and
sing
our
song
over
i
remember
that
miss
fannie
used
a
big
leaf
for
a
book
i
had
always
been
told
from
the
time
i
was
a
small
child
that
i
was
a
negro
of
african
stock
that
it
was
no
disgrace
to
be
a
negro
and
had
it
not
been
for
the
white
folks
who
brought
us
over
here
from
africa
as
slaves
we
would
never
have
been
here
and
would
have
been
much
better
off
we
colored
folks
were
not
allowed
to
be
taught
to
read
or
write
it
was
against
the
law
my
master
folks
always
treated
me
well
i
had
good
clothes
sometimes
i
was
whipped
for
things
i
should
not
have
done
just
as
the
white
children
were
when
a
young
girl
was
married
her
parents
would
always
give
her
a
slave
i
was
given
by
my
master
to
his
daughter
miss
elizabeth
who
married
blakely
i
was
just
five
years
old
she
moved
into
a
new
home
at
fayetteville
and
i
was
taken
along
but
she
soon
sent
me
back
home
to
my
master
telling
him
that
i
was
too
little
and
not
enough
help
to
her
so
i
went
back
to
the
parks
home
and
stayed
until
i
was
over
seven
years
old
my
master
made
a
bill
of
sale
for
me
to
his
daughter
in
order
to
keep
account
of
all
settlements
so
when
he
died
and
the
estate
settled
each
child
would
know
how
he
stood
i
was
about
years
old
when
the
civil
war
ended
and
was
still
living
with
blakely
and
helped
care
for
her
little
children
her
daughter
miss
lenora
later
married
hudgens
and
i
then
went
to
live
with
her
and
cared
for
her
children
when
her
daughter
miss
helen
married
professor
wiggins
i
took
care
of
her
little
daughter
and
this
made
five
generations
that
i
have
cared
for
during
the
civil
war
mr
parks
took
all
his
slaves
and
all
of
his
fine
stock
horses
and
cattle
and
went
south
to
louisiana
following
the
southern
army
for
protection
many
slave
owners
left
the
county
taking
with
them
their
slaves
and
followed
the
army
when
the
war
was
over
mr
parks
was
still
in
the
south
and
gave
to
each
one
of
his
slaves
who
did
not
want
to
come
back
to
arkansas
so
much
money
my
uncle
george
came
back
with
mr
parks
and
was
given
a
good
mountain
farm
of
forty
acres
which
he
put
in
cultivation
and
one
of
my
uncle
descendants
still
lives
on
the
place
my
mother
did
not
return
to
arkansas
but
went
on
to
joplin
missouri
and
for
more
than
fifty
years
neither
one
of
us
knew
where
the
other
one
was
until
one
day
a
man
from
fayetteville
went
into
a
restaurant
in
joplin
and
ordered
his
breakfast
and
my
mother
who
was
in
there
heard
him
say
he
lived
in
fayetteville
arkansas
he
lived
just
below
the
hudgens
home
and
when
my
mother
enquired
about
the
family
he
told
her
i
was
still
alive
and
was
with
the
family
while
neither
of
us
could
read
nor
write
we
corresponded
through
different
people
but
i
never
saw
her
after
i
was
eleven
years
old
later
hudgens
went
to
joplin
to
see
if
she
was
well
taken
care
of
she
owned
her
own
little
place
and
when
she
died
there
was
enough
money
for
her
to
be
buried
civil
war
days
are
vivid
to
me
the
courthouse
which
was
then
in
the
middle
of
the
square
was
burned
one
night
by
a
crazy
confederate
soldier
the
old
men
in
the
town
saved
him
and
then
put
him
in
the
county
jail
to
keep
him
from
burning
other
houses
each
family
was
to
take
food
to
him
and
they
furnished
bedding
the
morning
i
was
to
take
his
breakfast
he
had
ripped
open
his
feather
bed
and
crawled
inside
to
get
warm
the
room
was
so
full
of
feathers
when
i
got
there
that
his
food
nearly
choked
him
i
had
carried
him
ham
hot
biscuits
and
a
pot
of
coffee
after
the
war
many
soldiers
came
to
my
mistress
blakely
trying
to
make
her
free
me
i
told
them
i
was
free
but
i
did
not
want
to
go
anywhere
that
i
wanted
to
stay
in
the
only
home
that
i
had
ever
known
in
a
way
that
placed
me
in
a
wrong
attitude
i
was
pointed
out
as
different
sometimes
i
was
threatened
for
not
leaving
but
i
stayed
on
i
had
always
been
well
treated
by
my
master
folks
while
we
lived
at
the
old
kidd
place
there
was
a
church
a
few
miles
from
our
home
my
uncle
george
was
coachman
and
drove
my
master
family
in
great
splendor
in
a
fine
barouche
to
church
after
the
war
when
he
went
to
his
own
place
mr
parks
gave
him
the
old
carriage
and
bought
a
new
one
for
the
family
i
can
remember
the
days
of
slavery
as
happy
ones
we
always
had
an
abundance
of
food
old
aunt
martha
cooked
and
there
was
always
plenty
prepared
for
all
the
white
folks
as
well
as
the
colored
folks
there
was
a
long
table
at
the
end
of
the
big
kitchen
for
the
colored
folks
the
vegetables
were
all
prepared
of
an
evening
by
aunt
martha
with
someone
to
help
her
my
mother
seemed
to
have
a
gift
of
telling
fortunes
she
had
a
brass
ring
about
the
size
of
a
dollar
with
a
handwoven
knotted
string
that
she
used
i
remember
that
she
told
many
of
the
young
people
in
the
neighborhood
many
strange
things
they
would
come
to
her
with
their
premonitions
yes
we
were
afraid
of
the
patyroles
all
colored
folks
were
they
said
that
any
negroes
that
were
caught
away
from
their
master
premises
without
a
permit
would
be
whipped
by
the
patyroles
they
used
to
sing
a
song
nigger
run
the
patyroles
will
get
you
yes
the
war
separated
lots
of
families
mr

my
mistress
blakely
who
kept
the
masonic
building
from
being
burned
the
soldiers
came
to
set
it
on

burn
as
it
was
just
across
the

two
small
children
who
were
very
ill
in

rooms
she
told
the
soldiers
if
they
burned
the
masonic
building
that
her
house
would
burn
and
she
would
be
unable
to
save
her
little
children

she
is

i
was
born
in
the
country
several
miles
from
charlotte
in
macklenberg
county
north
carolina
in
my
father
name
was
john
alexander
and
my
mother
was
esther
mccolley
that
was
her
maiden
name
of
course
my
father
master
was
named
silas
alexander
and
my
mother
belonged
to
hugh
reed
i
do
know
just
how
she
and
my
father
happened
to
meet
these
two
slaveholders
were
adjoining
neighbors
you
might
say
my
father
and
my
mother
married
during
the
war
i
was
the
first
child
i
had
three
half
brothers
and
three
half
sisters
from
the
father
side
i
did
have
no
whole
brothers
and
sisters
i
am
the
only
one
on
my
mother
side
my
father
was
not
in
the
war
i
do
know
that
the
pateroles
bothered
him
very
much
my
father
and
mother
were
well
treated
by
our
master
and
then
both
she
and
my
father
were
quiet
and
their
masters
were
good
to
them
naturally
during
slavery
times
my
father
was
a
farmer
my
mother
farmed
too
she
was
a
hand
in
the
field
they
lived
in
a
little
log
cabin
one
room
they
had
a
bed
in
there
a
few
chairs
and
a
homemade
table
they
had
a
plank
floor
i
only
know
what
i
heard
my
people
speak
of
i
do
know
what
was
what
for
myself
because
i
was
too
young
from
what
i
can
understand
they
had
a
big
room
at
the
house
and
the
slaves
came
there
and
ate
there
they
had
a
colored
woman
who
prepared
their
meals
the
children
mostly
were
raised
on
pot
liquor
while
the
old
folk
were
working
the
larger
young
uns
mongst
the
children
would
take
care
of
the
little
ones
their
masters
never
forced
any
breeding
i
have
heard
of
that
happening
in
other
places
but
i
never
heard
them
speak
of
it
in
connection
with
our
master
when
the
master
came
back
from
the
war
they
told
the
slaves
they
were
free
after
slavery
my
people
stayed
on
and
worked
on
the
old
plantation
they
did
get
much
something
like
fifty
cents
a
day
and
one
meal
my
folks
did
work
on
shares
back
there
in
north
carolina
times
got
tight
and
it
seemed
that
there
was
much
doing
agents
came
from
arkansas
trying
to
get
laborers
so
about
seven
or
eight
families
of
us
emigrated
from
north
carolina
that
is
how
my
folks
got
here
the
ku
klux
were
bad
in
north
carolina
too
my
people
did
have
any
trouble
with
them
in
arkansas
though
they
were
bothered
so
much
in
north
carolina
because
of
their
owners
but
they
would
come
around
and
see
them
they
came
at
night
we
came
to
arkansas
in
the
winter
of
i
went
to
public
school
after
the
war
in
north
carolina
i
did
get
any
further
than
the
eighth
grade
my
father
and
mother
did
get
any
schooling
till
after
the
war
they
could
read
a
little
but
they
picked
it
up
themselves
during
slavery
i
suppose
their
master
children
learned
it
to
them
my
father
never
did
see
any
army
service
i
have
heard
him
speak
of
seeing
soldiers
come
through
though
they
looted
the
place
and
took
everything
they
wanted
and
could
carry
when
i
first
come
to
this
state
i
settled
in
drew
county
and
farmed
i
farmed
for
three
years
during
the
time
i
was
there
i
got
down
sick
with
slow
fever
when
i
got
over
that
i
decided
that
i
would
move
to
higher
ground
there
was
a
man
down
there
who
recommended
little
rock
and
so
i
moved
here
i
have
been
here
years
that
is
quite
a
few
days
i
belong
to
the
presbyterian
church
and
have
been
a
member
of
that
church
for
years
i
have
never
gotten
out
publicly
but
i
even
do
my
little
preaching
round
in
the
house
here
when
i
came
to
little
rock
i
came
in
a
very
dull
season
there
even
a
house
to
be
rented
it
was
in
the
winter
i
had
to
rent
a
room
at
jones
hall
on
ninth
and
gaines
streets
and
paid
one
dollar
a
day
for
it
i
stayed
there
about
a
month
finally
there
was
a
vacant
house
over
on
nineteenth
street
and
common
and
i
moved
there
then
i
commenced
to
look
for
work
and
i
walked
the
town
over
daily
no
results
whatever
finally
i
struck
a
little
job
with
the
contractor
here
digging
ditches
grubbing
stumps
grading
streets
and
so
forth
i
worked
with
him
for
three
years
and
finally
i
got
a
job
with
the
street
car
company
as
laborer
in
the
parks
i
worked
at
that
job
two
years
finally
i
got
a
job
as
track
laborer
i
worked
there
a
year
then
i
was
promoted
to
track
foreman
i
held
that
seven
years
i
quit
that
then
and
went
to
the
railroads
i
helped
to
build
the
choctaw
oklahoma
and
gulf
railway
when
the
road
was
completed
i
made
the
first
trip
over
it
as
porter
i
remained
there
till
august
during
that
time
i
was
operated
on
for
prostatitis
and
doctors
rendered
me
unfit
for
work
totally
disabled
so
that
is
my
condition
today
i
think
the
future
looks
bright
i
think
conditions
will
get
better
i
believe
that
all
that
is
necessary
for
betterment
is
cooperation
i
believe
the
younger
generation
the
way
it
looks
is
pretty
bad
i
think
we
have
done
anything
like
as
much
as
we
could
do
in
teaching
the
youngsters
we
need
to
give
them
an
idea
of
things
they
do
know
our
future
depends
on
our
children
if
their
minds
are
trained
the
future
will
not
be
bright
our
leaders
should
lecture
to
these
young
people
and
teach
them
we
have
young
people
who
dodge
voting
because
of
the
poll
tax
that
is
not
the
right
attitude
i
do
know
what
will
become
of
us
if
our
children
are
not
better
instructed
the
white
people
are
doing
more
of
this
than
we
are
there
was
a
time
when
children
did
know
but
what
the
foot
was
all
there
was
of
a
chicken
the
foot
was
all
they
had
ever
seen
but
young
folks
nowaday
should
be
taught
everything

us
black

do
want
war
they
are
not
war
kind
of
folks
slavery
was
right
and
that
war
was
right
neither
when
my
children
was
all
little
i
kept
aunt
mandy
buford
till
she
died
she
was
a
old
slave
woman
me
and
my
husband
and
the
biggest
children
worked
in
the
field
she
would
sit
about
and
smoke
my
boys
made
cob
pipes
and
cut
cane
for
to
draw
through
red
cob
pipes
was
the
prettiest
aunt
mandy
said
her
master
would
be
telling
them
what
to
do
in
the
field
and
he
say
to
her
talking
to
you
too
she
worked
right
among
the
men
at
the
same
kind
of
work
she
was
tall
but
not
large
she
carried
children
on
her
right
hip
when
she
was
so
young
she
dragged
that
foot
when
she
walked
the
reason
she
had
to
go
with
the
men
to
the
field
like
she
did
was
she
was
no
multiplying
woman
she
never
had
a
chile
in
all
her
lifetime
she
said
her
mother
nearly
got
in
bad
one
time
when
her
sister
was
carrying
a
baby
she
did
keep
up
said
the
riding
boss
got
down
dug
a
hole
with
the
hoe
to
lay
her
in
it
she
was
so
big
in
front
her
mother
told
him
if
he
put
her
daughter
there
in
that
hole
she
cop
him
up
in
pieces
wid
her
hoe
he
found
he
had
two
to
conquer
and
he
let
her
be
but
he
had
to
leave
he
could
whoop
the
niggers
if
i
could
think
of
all
she
tole
i
soon
have
enough
to
fill
up
that
book
you
getting
up
i
ca
recollect
who
she
belong
to
and
her
old
talk
comes
back
to
me
now
and
then
she
talked
so
much
we
get
up
and
go
on
off
to
keep
from
hearing
her
tell
things
over
so
many
times
folks
like
me
what
got
children
think
the
way
they
do
is
all
right
i
do
like
some
of
my
children
ways
but
none
of
us
perfect
i
tells
right
far
as
i
knows
times
what
makes
folks

stiff
around
biscoe

come
by
sleep
in

here
weaving

or
a
fine
hand
at
weaving

pretty
coverlets

i
see
colored

now
makes
me
think
about
my
baby
days
in
kentucky
freedom
was
something
mysterious
colored
folks
did
talk
it
white
folks
did
talk
it
the
first
i
realized
something
different
master
stone
was
going
to
whip
a
older
brother
he
told
mama
something
i
was
too
small
to
know
she
said
leave
this
year
son
i
going
to
leave
master
did
whip
him
master
stone
cousin

remember
her
well

were
all
very
nice
to
us
always
he
had
a
large
farm
he
had
twenty
servants
in
his
yard
we
all
lived
there
close
together
my
sister
and

we
had
plenty
to
eat
we
had
beef
in
spring
and
summer
mutton
and
kid
on
special
occasions
we
had
hog
in
the
fall
and
winter

had
them
when

corn
wheat
oats
rye
and
tobacco
once
a
year
we
got
dressed
up
we
got

a
year
we
did
have
fine
clothes

chicken
i
never
seen
biscuit
only
sometimes
i
seen
a
woman
sold
they
had
on
her
a
short
dress
no
sleeves
so
they
could
see
her
muscles
i
reckon
they
would
buy
them
and
put
them
with
good
healthy
men
to
raise
young
slaves
i
heard
that
i
was
very

times
were
better
in

i
was

i
was
born
right
here
in

some
of
the

came
from

i
was
born
on
thursday
in

at

may

my

has
told
me
that
so
often
i
have
it
memorized
persistence
of
slave
customs
while
i
was
a
slave
and
was
born
close
to
the
end
of
the
civil
war
i
remember
seeing
many
of
the
soldiers
down
here
i
remember
much
of
the
treatment
given
to
the
slaves
i
used
to
say
myself
in
my
day
we
had
to
do
that
till
after
or
i
remember
the
time
when
i
could
go
nowhere
without
asking
the
folks
i
was
a
slave
then
but
i
could
go
off
without
asking
the
white
people
i
know
no
better
i
have
known
the
time
in
the
southern
part
of
this
state
when
if
you
wanted
to
give
an
entertainment
you
would
have
to
ask
the
white
folks
did
know
no
better
for
years
and
years
most
of
the
niggers
just
stayed
with
the
white
folks
did
want
to
leave
them
just
took
what
they
give
and
did
ask
for
nothing
different
if
i
had
known
forty
years
ago
what
i
know
now
first

in
tulip
arkansas
the
first
negro

we
ever
seen

we
were
all
excited
there
were
plenty
of
people
who
did
have
a
doctor
living
with
twenty
miles
of
them
when
i
was
fourteen
years
old
i
was
secretary
of
a
conference
schooling
what
little
i
know
an
old
white
woman
taught
me
i
started
to
school
under
this
old
woman
because
there
were
any
colored
teachers
there
was
any
school
at
tulip
where
i
lived

down
there
some
years
back
to
get
me
to
sign
a
title
to

klux
klan
pateroles
jayhawkers
and
the
ku
klux
came
before
the
war
the
ku
klux
in
slavery
times
were
men
who
would
catch
negroes
out
and
keep
them
if
they
did
not
collect
from
their
masters
the
pateroles
would
catch
negroes
out
and
return
them
if
they
did
not
have
a
pass
they
whipped
them
sometimes
if
they
did
not
have
a
pass
the
jayhawkers
were
highway
men
or
robbers
who
stole
slaves
among
other
things
at
least
that
is
the
way
the
people
regarded
them
the
jayhawkers
stole
and
pillaged
while
the
ku
klux
stole
those
negroes
they
caught
out
the
word
was
never
included
in
their
name
the
ku
klux
klan
was
an
organization
which
arose
after
the
civil
war
it
was
composed
of
men
who
believed
in
white
supremacy
and
who
regulated
the
morals
of
the
neighborhood
they
were
not
only
after
jews
and
negroes
but
they
were
sworn
to
protect
the
better
class
of
people
they
took
the
law
in
their
own
hands
slave
work
i
not
so
certain
about
the
amount
of
work
required
of
slaves
my
mother
says
she
picked
four
hundred
pounds
of
cotton
many
a
day
the
slaves
were
tasked
and
given
certain
amounts
to
accomplish
i
do
know
the
exact
amount
nor
just
how
it
was
determined
opinions
it
is
too
bad
that
the
young
negroes
do
know
what
the
old
negroes
think
and
what
they
have
done
the
young
folks
could
be
helped
if
they
would
take
advice
interviewer
comment
badgett
distinctions
between
jayhawkers
ku
klux
patrollers
and
ku
klux
klan
are
most
interesting
i
have
been
slow
to
catch
it
all
my
life
i
have
heard
persons
with
background
refer
to
the
activities
of
the
ku
klux
among
slaves
prior
to
i
always
thought
that
they
had
the
klux
klan
and
the
patrollers
confused
badgett
definite
and
memories
however
lead
me
to
believe
that
many
of
the
negroes
who
were
slaves
used
the
word
ku
klux
to
denote
a
type
of
persons
who
stole
slaves
it
was
evidently
in
use
before
it
was
applied
to
the
ku
klux
klan
the
words
ku
klux
and
ku
klux
klan
are
used
indiscriminately
in
current
conversation
and
literature
it
is
also
true
that
many
persons
in
the
present
do
and
in
the
past
did
refer
to
the
ku
klux
klan
simply
as
ku
klux
it
is
a
matter
of
record
that
the
organization
did
not
at
first
bear
the
name
ku
klux
klan
throughout
the
south
the
name
ku
klux
seems
to
have
grown
in
application
as
the
organization
changed
from
a
moral
association
of
the
best
citizens
of
the
south
and
gradually
came
under
the
control
of
lawless
persons
with
lawless
methods
whipping
and
murdering
it
is
antecedently
reasonable
that
the
change
in
names
accompanying
a
change
in
policy
would
be
due
to
a
fitness
in
the
prior
use
of
the
name
the
recent
use
of
the
name
seems
mostly
imitation
and
propaganda
histories
encyclopedias
and
dictionaries
in
general
do
not
record
a
meaning
of
the
term
ku
klux
as
prior
to
the
reconstruction

james

aged

with

at
wade
st
the
outskirts
of
eastern
hot
springs
resemble
a
vast
checkerboard
patterned
in
black
and
white
within
two
blocks
of
a
house
made
of
siding
painted
a
spotless
white
and
provided
with
blue
shutters
will
be
a
shack
which
appears
to
have
been
made
from
the
discard
of
a
dozen
generations
of
houses
some
of
the
yards
are
thick
with
rusting
cans
old
tires
and
miscelaneous
rubbish
some
of
them
are
so
gutted
by
gully
wash
that
any
attempt
at
beautification
would
be
worse
than
useless
some
are
swept

fashion
free
from

beyond
her
destination
from
a
hilltop
she
could
look
down
on
less
elevated
hills
and
into
narrow
valleys
the
impression
was
that
of
a
cheaply
painted
designed
for
a
stock
presentation
of
wiggs
of
the
cabbage
patch
moving
along
streets
alleys
and
paths
backward
toward
town
the

reached
another
hill
almost
a
quarter
of
a
mile
away
she
spied
an
old
colored
man
sunning
himself
on
the
front
porch
of
a
well
kept
cottage
somthing
about
his
white
hair
and

and
put
the
saddle
on
old
master
saddle
horse
i
was
very
small
but
when
the
first
railroad
come
through
old
master
took
us
to
see
the
train
i
guess
it
was
about
forty
or
fifty
miles
because
it
took
us
around
four
days
to
make
the
round
trip
the
trains
were
not
like
they
are
now
the
engine
was
smaller
and
they
burned
wood
and
they
had
what
they
called
a
drum
head
and
they
did
run
very
fast
and
could
not
carry
many
cars
it
was
a
narrow
gauge
road
and
the
rails
were
small
and
the
road
was
dirt
it
was
not
gravel
and
rocks
like
it
is
now
it
was
a
great
show
to
me
and
we
all
had
something
to
talk
about
for
a
long
time
people
all
around
went
to
see
it
and
we
camped
out
one
night
going
and
coming
and
camped
one
night
at
the
railroad
so
we
could
see
the
train
the
next
day
a
man
kept
putting
wood
in
the
furnace
in
order
to
keep
a
fire
smoke
come
out
of
the
drum
head
the
drum
head
was
something
like
a
big
washpot
or
a
big
old
hogshead
barrel
an
ox
team
was
used
for
most
all
traveling
you
did
not
see
very
many
horses
or
mules
the
white
children
taught
us
how
to
read
and
i
went
to
school
too
i
went
to
church
too
we
did
not
have
a
church
house
we
used
a
brush
arbor
for
service
for
a
long
time
in
the
winter
we
built
a
big
fire
in
the
middle
and
we
sat
all
around
the
fire
on
small
pine
logs
later
they
built
a
log
church
so
we
had
service
in
there
for
years
we
did
not
live
near
a
school
so
old
mistress
and
the
children
taught
us
how
to
read
and
write
and
count
i
never
went
to
school
in
my
life
and
i
bet
you
ca
none
of
these
children
that
rub
their
heads
on
college
walls
beat
me
reading
and
counting
you
call
one
and
ask
them
to
divide
cows
and
one
bull
by
two
and
they
answer
it
to
save
their
lives
without
a
pencil
and
paper
and
two
figuring
when
it
nothing
to
say
but
fifty
was
no
cook
stoves
and
heaters
until
about
or
if
there
was
i
did
not
know
about
them
they
cooked
on
fireplace
and
fire
out
in
the
yard
on
what
they
called
oven
and
we
had
plenty
of
plain
grub
we
stole
eggs
from
the
big
house
because
we
never
got
any
eggs
the
custom
of
marrying
was
just
pack
up
and
go
on
and
live
with
who
you
wanted
to
that
is
the
negroes
did
i
do
know
how
the
white
people
married
this
lawful
marrying
came
from
the
law
since
man
made
law
when
anybody
died
everybody
stopped
working
and
moaned
and
prayed
until
after
the
burying
i
can
say
there
is
as
much
difference
between
now
and
sixty
years
ago
as
it
is
in
day
and
night

education
there
i
have
had
much
education
i
went
as
far
as
the
eighth
grade
the
biggest
education
i
have
had
was
in
the
conference
i
joined
the
little
rock
general
conference
at
texarkana
in
this
was
the
methodist
episcopal

and
i
was
ordained
as

later

then
in

joined

by
trade
i
am
a
carpenter
and
bricklayer
i
served
an
apprentice
under
my
father
and
under
a
german
contractor
i
used
to
be
called
the
best
negro
journeyman
carpenter
between
monroe
louisiana
and
little
rock
arkansas
i
made
quite
a
success
in

trade
i

i
was
in
the
mercantile
business
two
and
years
in
sevier
county
i
sold

it
was
too
confining
and
returned
to
the
carpenter
trade
i
still
practice
my
trade
some
now
i
have
not
had
to
ask
help
from
anyone
i
have
helped
others
i
own
my
home
and
i
sent
my
daughter
to

university
where
she
was

while
there
she
met
a
young

they
were
later
married
and
now
live
in
chicago
they
own
their
home
and
are
doing
well
in
my
work
in
the
ministry
i
am
trying
to
teach
my
people
to
have
higher
ideals
we
have
to
bring
our
race
to
that
high
ideal
of
race
integrity
i
am
trying
to
keep
the
negro
from
thinking
he
is
hated
by
the
upper
class
of
white
people
what
the
negro
needs
is
to
the
extent
that
he
aspires
to
the
higher
principles
in
order
to
stand
on
an
equal
plane
in
attainment
but
not
in
a
social
way
at
present
the
negro
ideals
are
too
low
for
him
to
visualize
the
evils
involved
in
race
mixture
he
needs
to
be
lifted
in
his
own
estimation
and
learn
that
a
race
can
not
be
estimated
by
other
races
by
anything
else
but
their
own
ideals
the
younger
generation
is
off
on
a
tangent
they
have
to
hit
something
before
they
stop
the
salvation
of
our
people
of
all
people
white
and
colored
is
leadership
we
got
to
have
vision
and
try
to
give
the
people
vision
not
to
live
for
ourselves
but
for
all
the
present
generation
is
selfish
the
life
should
flow
out
and
as
it
flows
out
it
makes
room
for
more
life
if
it
does
not
flow
out
it
congeals
and
ferments
selfishness
is
just
like
damming
a
stream
i
think
woodrow
wilson
won
the
world
war
with
his
fourteen
points
of
democracy
if
the
people
of
foreign
countries
had
not
that
old
imperialism
sentiment
the

would
not
be

they

and
how
they

to
have
to

their
master
would
allow
them
to
whip
his
hands
no
it
was
the
mistress
that
would
allow
them
to
be
whipped
they
had
hot
words
about
that
sometimes
the
slaves
had
to
weave
cotton
and
knit
sox
sometimes
they
would
work
all
night
weaving
cloth
and
spinning
thread
the
spinning
would
be
done
first
they
would
make
cloth
for

they
used
to
have
tanning
vats

that
was
gittin
some
cotton
if
they
did
come
up
to
the
task
they
was
took
out
and
give
a
whipping
the
overseer
would
do
the
thrashing
the
old
mistress
and
master
would
agree
on
that
whipping
fun
the
slaves
were
allowed
to
get
out
and
have
their
fun
and
play
and
for
so
many
hours
outside
of
those
hours
they
had
to
be
found
in
their
house
they
had
to
use
fiddles
they
had
dancing
just
like
the
boys
do
now
they
had
knockin
and
rasslin
and
all
such
like
now
church
so
for
as
serving
god
was
concerned
they
had
to
take
a
kettle
and
turn
it
down
bottom
upward
and
then
old
master
could
hear
the
singing
and
prayin
i
do
know
just
how
they
turned
the
kettle
to
keep
the
noise
from
goin
out
but
i
heard
my
father
and
mother
say
they
did
it
the
kettle
would
be
on
the
inside
of
the
cabin
not
on
the
outside
house
furniture
food
the
slaves
lived
in
log
houses
instead
of
ones
like
now
with
the
two
ends
duffed
in
they
always
had
them
so
they
would
hold
a
nice
family
never
had
any
partitions
to
make
rooms
it
was
just
a
straight
long
house
with
one
window
and
one
door
provisions
were
weighed
out
to
them
they
were
allowed
four
pounds
of
meat
and
a
peck
of
meal
for
each
working
person
they
only
provided
for
the
working
folks
if
i
had
eight
in
a
family
i
would
just
get
the
same
amount
there
was
no
provisions
for
children
but
all
the
children
on
the
place
were
given
something
from
the
big
house
the
working
folks
ate
their
breakfast
before
daylight
in
the
log
cabin
where
they
lived
they
ate
their
supper
at
home
too
they
was
allowed
to
get
back
home
by
seven
or
eight
the
slaves
on
my
place
never
ate
together
i
do
know
anything
about
that
kind
of
feeding
they
had
nurses
old
folks
that
were
able
to
work
any
longer
all
the
children
would
go
to
the
same
place
to
be
cared
for
and
the
old
people
would
look
after
them
they
was
able
to
work
you
know
they
fed
the
children
during
the
day
how
freedom
came
my
father
and
mother
and
grandmother
said
the
overseer
told
them
that
they
were
free
i
guess
that
was
in
the
same
year
i
was
born
the
overseer
told
them
that
they
did
have
any
owner
now
they
was
free
folks
the
boss
man
told
them
too
had
them
to
come
up
to
the
big
house
and
told
them
they
had
to
look
out
for
themselves
now
because
they
were
free
as
he
was
right
after
the
war
right
after
emancipation
my
folks
were
freed
the
boss
man
told
them
they
could
work
by
the
day
or
sharecrop
or
they
could
work
by
groups
a
group
of
folks
could
go
together
and
work
and
the
boss
man
would
pay
them
so
much
a
day
i
believe
they
worked
for
him
a
good
while
about
seven
or
eight
years
at
least
they
was
in
one
of
the
groups
earliest
recollections
my
own
earliest
recollections
was
of
picking
cotton
in
one
of
those
squads
the
groups
i
was
telling
you
about
after
that
the
people
got
to
renting
land
and
renting
stock
for
themselves
they
sharecropped
then
it
seems
to
me
that
everybody
was
satisfied
i
do
remember
any
one
saying
that
he
was
cheated
or
beat
out
of
anything
schooling
we
had
a
public
school

much
part

that
was
the
yankees
i
was
born
down
here
on
dr
waters
place
born
right
here
in
arkansas
and
ai
been
outa
arkansas
since
i
was
born
so
far
as
i
know
dr
waters
was
good
to
us
i
do
know
how
old
i
was
i
know
i
used
to
go
to
the
house
with
my
mother
and
piddle
around
my
father
jined
the
yankees
and
he
died
in
the
army
i
heered
the
old
people
talkin
sayin
we
was
goin
to
be
free
you
i
have
much
sense
cause
i
was
down
on
the
river
bank
and
the
yankees
was
shootin
across
the
river
and
i
said
you
quit
that
shootin
so
you
know
i
did
have
much
sense
i
can
remember
old
man
curtaindall
had
these
nigger
dogs
had
to
go
up
a

to
keep
em
from
bitin
you
dr

would
have
us
take
the
cotton
and
hide
it
in
the
swamp
to
keep
the
yankees
from
burnin
it
but
they
find
it
some
way
never
went
to
school
over
two
months
in
all
my
goin
we
always
lived
in
a
place
kinda
unhandy
to
go
to
school
first
teacher
i
had
was
named
bell
i
think
he
was
a
northern
man
all
my
life
i
been
farmin
still
do
been
many
a
day
since
i
sold
a
bale
a
cotton
myself
white
man
does
the
ginnin
and
packin
all
i
do
is
raise
it
i
farmin
on
the
shares
and
i
think
if
i
raise
four
bales
i
ought
to
have
two
bales
to
sell
and
boss
man
two
bales
but
it
that
way
i
voted
ever
since
i
got
to
be
a
man
grown
that
is
as
long
as
i
could
vote
you
know
got
so
now
they
wo
let
you
vote
i
do
think
a
person
is
free
unless
he
can
vote
do
you
the
way
this
thing
is
goin
i
do
think
the
white
man
wants
the
colored
man
to
have
as
much
as
the
white
man
when
i
could
vote
i
jus

in
a
log
hut
they

for
a
jail
if

thing
they
was
gittin
it
to
water

raise
children
just
like
you
would
raise
colts
to
a
mare
or
calves
to
a
cow
or
pigs
to
a
sow
it
was
just
a
business
it
was
a
bad
thing
but
it
was
better
than
the
county
farm

did
whip
you

of
people
down

the
state
farm
at
cummins

try
it
one
half

thing

a
good
time

good
folks

sun
go
down
while

were
out
that
called
the
pateroles
some
folks
call
the
ku
klux
it
was
all
the
same
old
poor
white
trash
they
kept
up
that
business
for
about
ten
years
after
the
war
they
kept
it
up
till
folks
began
to
kill
up
a
lot
of
that
the
only
thing
that
stopped
them
my
daddy
used
to
make
his
own
bullets
i
forgot
who
it
is
that
told
us
that
we
was
free
somebody

free
now
i
done
forgot
who
it
was
right
after
the
war
my
father
farmed
a
while
and
after
that
he
pulled
a
skiff
you
know
jim
lawson
place
he
stayed
on
it
twenty
years
he
stayed
at
the
ferguson
place
about
ten
years
they
adjoining
places
he
stayed
at
the
churchill
place
widow
scott
place
the
bojean
place
that
all
have
you
been
down
in
argenta
to
the
roundhouse
place
runs
way
down
to
there
it
was
nothing
but
farms
in
little
rock
then
the
river
road
was
the
only
one
there
at
that
time
it
would
take
a
day
to
cone
down
from
clear
lake
with
the
cotton
you
would
start
about
midnight
and
you
would
get
to
argenta
at
nine
the
next
morning
the
roads
was
always
bad
after
freedom
we
worked
on
shares
a
while
then
we
rented
when
we
worked
on
shares
we
could
make
nothing
just
overalls
and
something
to
eat
half
went
to
the
other
man
and
you
would
destroy
your
half
if
you
were
careful
a
man
that
did
know
how
to
count
would
always
lose
he
might
lose
anyhow
they
did
give
no
itemized
statement
no
you
just
had
to
take
their
word
they
never
give
you
no
details
they
just
say
you
owe
so
much
no
matter
how
good
account
you
kept
you
had
to
go
by
their
account
and
now
brother
i
tellin
you
the
truth
about
this
it
been
that
way
for
a
long
time
you
had
to
take
the
white
man
work
on
notes
and
everything
anything
you
wanted
you
could
git
if
you
were
a
good
hand
you
could
git
anything
you
wanted
as
long
as
you
worked
if
you
did
make
no
money
that
all
right
they
would
advance
you
more
but
you
better
not
leave
him
you
better
not
try
to
leave
and
get
caught
they
keep
you
in
debt
they
were
sharp
christmas
come
you
could
take
up
twenty
dollars
in
somethin
to
eat
and
much
as
you
wanted
in
whiskey
you
could
buy
a
gallon
of
whiskey
anything
that
kept
you
a
slave
because
he
was
always
right
and
you
were
always
wrong
if
there
was
difference
if
there
was
an
argument
he
would
get
mad
and
there
would
be
a
shooting
take
place
and
you
know
how
some
negroes
is
long
as
they
could
git
somethin
they
did
care
you
see
if
the
white
man
came
out
behind
he
would
feed
you
let
you
have
what
you
wanted
he
just
keep
you
on
help
you
get
on
your
feet
that
is
if
you
were
a
good
hand
but
if
you
were
a
good
hand
he
just
let
you
have
enough
to
keep
you
alive
a
good
hand
could
take
care
of
forty
or
fifty
acres
of
land
and
would
have
a
large
family
a
good
hand
could
git
clothes
food
whiskey
whenever
he
wanted
it
my
father
had
nine
children

care
of
them

interviewer
comment
henry
blake
age
appears
in
excess
of
eighty
his
idea
of
is
based
on
what
someone
told
him
he
is
certain
that
he
drove
a
horsepower
gin
wagon
during
slavery
times
and
that
he
was
seven
or
eight
when
he
drove
it
even
if
that
were
in
he
would
be
at
least
eighty
years
old
years
since
the
war
plus
seven
years
of
his
life
his
manner
of
narration
would
indicate
that
he
drove
earlier
the
interview
was
held
in
a
dark
room
and
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
i
took
notes
without
seeing
the
paper
on
which
i
was
writing
interviewer
mary
eudgins
person
interviewed
miss
adeline
blakeley
age
home
rock
street
fayetteville
arkansas
there
is
no
hint
of
elision
in
the
speech
of
adeline
blakeley
scarcely
a
trace
of
vernacular
all
of
her
life
her
associations
have
been
with
white
persons
she
occupies
a
position
rare
in
days
of
negro
servant
confidant
and
friend
after
the
death
of
hudgins
family
intimates
wives
of
physicians
bankers
wives
and
other
fayetteville
dowagers
continued
periodically
to
come
to
see
adeline
they
came
not
in
the
spirit
of
lady
bountifuls
condescending
to
a
hireling
but
because
they
wanted
to
chat
with
an
old
time
friend
interviewer
note
as
told
by
adeline
blakeley
honey
look
in
the
bible
to
get
the
date
when
i
was
born
we
want
to
have
it
just
right
yes
here
the
place
read
it
to
me
july
yes
i
remember
now
that
what
they
always
told
me
i
wanted
to
be
sure
though
i
was
born
in
hickman
county
and
was
about
a
year
when
they
brought
me
to
arkansas
my
mother
and
her
people
had
been
bought
by
john
parks
when
they
were
just
children
john
and
leanna
and
martha
i
was
the
first
little
negro
in
the
parks
kitchen
from
the
first
they
made
a
pet
out
of
me
i
was
little
like
a
doll
and
they
treated
me
like
a
plaything
spoiled
me
rotten
after
mr
parks
came
to
arkansas
he
lived
near
what
is
now
prarie
grove
but
what
do
you
think
it
was
called
then
hog
eye
later
on
they
named
it
hillingsley
for
a
man
who
settled
there
we
were
two
miles
out
on
the
wire
road
the
one
the
telegraph
line
came
in
on
honey
almost
every
conmunity
had
a
road
it
was
the
custom
to
give
a
girl
a
slave
when
she
was
married
when
miss
parks
became
blakeley
she
moved
to
fayetteville
and
chose
me
to
take
with
her
she
said
since
i
was
only
she
could
raise
me
as
she
wanted
me
to
be
but
i
must
have
been
a
lot
of
trouble
and
after
she
had
her
baby
she
had
to
send
me
back
to
her
father
to
grow
up
a
little
for
you
might
say
she
had
two
babies
to
take
care
of
since
i
was
too
little
to
take
care
of
hers
they
sent
a
woman
in
my
place
honey
when
i
got
back
i
was
awful
i
had
been
with
the
negroes
down
in
the
country
and
said
and
and
words
like
that
of
course
all
the
children
in
the
house
took
it
up
from
me
blakeley
had
to
teach
me
to
talk
right
your
aunt
nora
was
born
while
i
was
away
i
was
too
little
to
take
full
charge
of
her
but
i
could
sit
in
a
chair
and
hold
her
on
my
lap
blakeley
taught
her
children
at
home
her
teaching
was
almost
all
they
had
before
they
entered
the
university
when
i
was
little
i
wanted
to
learn
learn
all
i
could
but
there
was
a
law
against
teaching
a
slave
to
read
and
write
one
woman
she
was
from
the
north
did
it
anyway
but
when
folks
can
read
and
write
its
going
to
be
found
out
it
was
made
pretty
hard
for
that
woman
after
the
war
they
tried
to
get
me
to
learn
but
i
tossed
my
head
and
would
let
them
teach
me
i
was
about
and
thought
i
was
grown
and
would
need
to
know
any
more
mary
it
sounds
funny
but
if
i
had
a
million
dollars
i
would
give
it
gladly
to
be
able
to
read
and
write
letters
to
my
friends
i
remember
well
when
the
war
started
blakeley
he
was
a
cabinet
maker
and
not
very
well
was
not
considered
strong
enough
to
go
but
if
the
war
had
kept
up
much
longer
they
would
have
called
him
mr
parks
did
believe
in
seceding
he
held
out
as
long
as
it
was
safe
to
do
so
if
you
did
go
with
the
popular
side
they
called
you
or
maybe
but
when
arkansas
did
go
over
he
was
loyal
he
had
two
sons
and
a
in
the
confederate
army
one
fought
at
richmond
and
one
was
killed
at
gettysburg
the
little
blakeley
boy
had
always
liked
to
play
with
the
american
flag
he
march
with
it
and
carry
it
out
on
the
porch
and
hang
it
up
but
after
the
trouble
began
to
brew
his
mother
told
him
he
would
have
to
stay
in
the
house
when
he
played
with
the
flag
even
then
somebody
saw
him
and
scolded
him
and
said
burn
it
or
wash
it
the
child
thought
they
meant
it
and
he
tried
to
wash
it
dyes
were
so
good
in
those
days
and
it
ran
terribly
it
was
the
awfulest
thing
you
ever
saw
fayetteville
suffered
all
thru
the
war
you
see
we
were
not
very
far
from
the
dividing
line
and
both
armies
were
about
here
a
lot
the
federals
were
in
charge
most
of
the
time
they
had
a
post
here
set
up
breast
works
and
fortified
the
square
the
court
house
was
in
the
middle
of
it
then
it
was
funny
that
there
was
more
real
fighting
about
here
there
were
several
battles
but
they
were
more
like
skirmishes
just
a
few
men
killed
each
time
they
were
terrible
just
the
same
at
first
they
buried
the
union
soldiers
where
the
confederate
cemetery
is
now
the
southerners
were
placed
just
anywhere
later
on
they
moved
the
northern
caskets
over
to
where
the
federal
cemetery
is
now
and
they
took
up
the
southern
men
when
they
knew
where
to
find
them
and
placed
them
over
on
the
hill
where
they
are
today
once
an
officer
came
into
our
home
and
liked
a
table
he
saw
so
he
took
it
blakeley
followed
his
horse
as
far
as
she
could
pleading
with
him
to
give
it
back
because
her
husband
had
made
it
the
next
day
a
neighbor
returned
it
he
hod
found
it
in
the
road
and
recognized
it
the
man
who
stole
it
had
been
killed
and
dropped
it
as
he
fell
just
before
the
battle
of
prairie
grove
the
federal
men
came
thru
some
officers
stopped
and
wanted
us
to
cook
for
them
paid
us
well
too
one
man
took
little
nora
on
his
lap
and
almost
cried
he
said
she
reminded
him
of
his
own
little
girl
he
maybe
never
see
again
he
gave
her
a
cute
little
ivory
handled
pen
knife
he
asked
blakeley
if
he
could
leave
his
pistols
with
her
until
he
came
back
thru
fayetteville
she
told
him
it
was
asking
too
much
what
would
happen
to
her
and
her
family
if
they
found
those
weapons
in
her
possession
but
he
argued
that
it
was
only
for
a
few
days
she
hid
them
under
a
tub
in
the
basement
and
after
waiting
a
year
gave
them
to
her
brother
when
he
came
through
the
yankees
met
the
southerners
at
prairie
grove
the
shots
sounded
just
like
popcorn
from
here
in
fayetteville
we
always
thought
the
man
got
killed
there
the
soldiers
camped
all
around
everywhere
lots
of
them
were
in
tents
and
some
of
the
officers
were
in
houses
they
did
burn
the
college
where
miss
sawyer
had
taught
you
know
the
officers
used
it
for
their
living
quarters
they
built
barracks
for
the
men
of
upright
logs
see
that
building
across
the
street
it
been
lots
of
things
a
livery
stable
veterinary
barn
apartment
house
but
it
was
one
of
the
oldest
buildings
in
arkansas
they
kept
on
remodeling
it
the
yankees
made
a
commissary
out
of
it
later
on
they
moved
the
food
up
on
the
square
and
used
it
for
a
hospital
i
can
remember
lots
of
times
seeing
the
feet
of
dead
men
sticking
out
of
the
windows
your
aunt
nora
mother
saved
that
building
from
being
burned
how
did
it
happen
well
you
see
both
sides
were
firing
buildings
the
confederates
to
keep
the
yankees
from
getting
them
and
the
other
way
about
but
the
southerners
did
most
of
the
burning
little
boy
was
sick
with
fever
she
and
a
friend
went
up
because
they
feared
burnings
they
sat
there
almost
all
night
parties
of
men
would
come
along
and
they
would
plead
with
them
one
sat
in
one
doorway
and
the
other
in
the
building
next
blakely
was
a
southerner
the
other
woman
a
northerner
between
them
they
kept
the
buildings
from
being
burned
saved
their
own
homes
thereby
and
possibly
the
life
of
the
little
sick
boy
it
was
like
that
in
fayetteville
there
were
so
many
folks
on
both
sides
and
they
lived
so
close
together
that
they
got
to
know
one
another
and
were
friends
things
like
this
would
happen
one
day
a
northern
officer
came
over
to
our
house
to
talk
to
his
wife
who
was
visiting
he
said
he
would
be
away
all
day
he
was
to
go
down
to
prarie
grove
to
get
man
parks
dead
or
alive
not
until
he
was
on
his
way
did
somebody
tell
him
that
he
was
talking
about
the
father
of
his
wife
hostess
next
day
he
came
over
to
apologize
said
he
never
would
have
made
such
a
cruel
remark
if
he
had
known
but
he
did
find
his
man
as
the
officers
went
in
the
front
door
mr
parks
went
out
of
the
back
and
the
women
surrounded
him
until
he
got
away
there
was
another
time
when
the
north
and
south
took
refuge
together
during
the
war
even
the
little
children
were
taught
to
listen
for
bugle
calls
and
know
what
they
meant
we
had
to
know
and
how
to
act
when
we
heard
them
one
day
i
remember
we
were
to
have
peas
for
dinner
with
ham
hock
and
corn
bread
i
was
hungry
that
day
and
everything
smelled
so
good
but
just
as
the
peas
were
part
of
them
out
of
the
pot
and
in
a
dish
on
the
table
the
signal
came
arms
cannon
followed
almost
immediately
we
all
ran
for
the
cellar
leaving
the
food
as
it
was
the
cellar
was
dug
out
only
a
little
way
down
it
had
been
raining
and
snowing
all
day
melted
as
it
fell
it
was
about
noon
and
the
seep
water
had
filled
a
pool
in
the
middle
of
the
cellar
they
placed
a
tub
in
the
water
and
it
floated
like
a
little
boat
they
put
nora
and
a
little
girl
who
was
visiting
her
and
me
in
it
the
grown
folks
clung
to
the
damp
sides
of
the
cellar
floor
and
wall
after
the
worst
bombing
was
over
we
heard
someone
upstairs
in
the
house
calling
it
was
the
wife
of
a
northern
officer
he
had
gotten
away
so
fast
he
had
forgotten
his
pistols
she
had
tried
to
follow
him
but
the
shots
had
frightened
her
we
called
to
her
to
come
to
the
basement
she
came
but
in
trying
to
climb
up
the
slick
sides
she
slid
down
and
almost
into
our
tub
she
looked
so
funny
with
her
big
fat
legs
that
i
giggled
blakeley
slapped
me
it
was
one
of
the
few
times
she
struck
me
i
was
glad
she
did
for
i
would
have
laughed
out
and
it
did
do
to
laugh
at
northerners
it
wes
night
before
the
fighting
was
over
an
old
man
who
was
in
the
basement
with
us
went
upstairs
because
he
heard
someone
groan
sure
enough
a
wounded
man
had
dragged
himself
to
our
door
he
laid
the
man
almost
fainting
down
before
the
fireplace
it
was
all
he
could
do
the
man
died
when
we
finally
came
up
there
was
a
pea
nor
a
bit
of
ham
not
a
crum
of
cornbread
floaters
had
cleaned
the
pot
until
it
shone
we
had
a
terrible
time
getting
along
during
those
years
i
do
believe
we
could
have
done
it
except
for
the
northern
soldiers
you
might
say
the
confederacy
was
kept
up
by
private
subscription
but
the
yankees
had
the
whole
federal
government
back
of
them
they
had
good
rations
which
were
issued
uncooked
they
could
get
them
prepared
anywhere
they
liked
we
were
good
cooks
so
that
is
the
way
we
got
our
food
preparing
it
for
soldiers
and
eating
it
with
them
they
had
quite
a
variety
and
a
lot
of
everything
they
were
given
bacon
and
coffee
and
sugar
and
flour
and
beans
and
somthing
they
called
vegetables
those
beans
were
little
and
sweet
not
like
the
big
ones
we
have
today
the
mixed
vegetables
were
liked
by
lots
of
folks
i
did
care
for
them
everything
was
ground
up
together
and
then
dried
you
had
to
soak
it
like
dried
peas
before
cooking
after
the
war
they
came
to
blakeley
the
soldiers
did
and
accused
her
of
keeping
me
against
my
will
i
told
them
that
i
stayed
because
i
wanted
to
the
blakeleys
were
my
people
they
let
me
alone
the
whites
did
but
the
negroes
did
like
it
they
tried
to
fight
me
and
called
me
names
there
was
a
well
near
the
square
from
which
everybody
got
water
between
it
and
our
house
was
a
negro
cabin
the
little
negroes
would
rock
me
i
stood
it
as
long
as
i
could
then
i
told
blakeley
she
said
to
get
some
rocks
in
my
bucket
and
if
they
rocked
me
to
heave
back
i
was
a
good
shot
and
they
ran
their
mother
came
to
blakeley
to
complain
but
she
told
her
after
hearing
her
thru
that
i
had
stood
all
i
could
and
the
only
reason
i
had
been
seriously
hurt
was
because
her
children
were
good
shots
they
never
bothered
me
again
it
was
hard
after
the
war
the
federals
stayed
on
for
a
long
time
fences
were
down
houses
were
burned
stock
was
gone
but
we
got
along
somehow
when
nora
blakeley
was
a
lady
was
teaching
a
subscription
school
in
the
hall
across
the
street
the
same
hall
blakely
had
saved
from
burning
she
wanted
nora
to
teach
for
her
so
child
that
she
was
she
went
over
and
pretty
soon
she
was
teaching
up
to
the
fourth
grade
i
went
over
every
morning
and
built
a
fire
for
her
before
she
arrived
that
fall
she
went
over
to
the
university
but
the
next
year
she
had
to
stay
out
to
earn
money
she
wanted
to
finish
so
badly
that
we
decided
to
take
boarders
they
would
come
to
us
from
way
over
on
the
campus
there
were
always
lots
more
who
wanted
to
stay
than
we
could
take
we
bought
silver
and
dishes
just
as
we
could
pay
for
them
and
we
added
to
the
house
in
the
summer
time
i
used
to
cook
their
breakfasts
and
dinners
and
pack
baskets
of
lunch
for
them
to
take
over
to
the
campus
we
had
lots
of
interesting
people
with
us
one
was
jeff
davis
later
he
was
governor
and
then
senator
he
and
a
creek
indian
boy
named
sam
rice
were
great
friends
there
were
lots
of
indians
in
school
at
the
university
then
they
did
have
so
many
indian
schools
and
tribes
would
make
up
money
and
send
a
bright
boy
here
ten
years
after
she
graduated
from
the
university
nora
married
harvey
hudgins
they
moved
to
hot
springs
and
finally
ran
a
hotel
it
burned
the
night
of
washington
birthday
in
it
was
terrible
we
saved
nothing
but
the
night
clothes
we
were
in
next
morning
it
was
worse
for
we
saw
small
pox
flags
all
over
town
our
friends
came
to
our
rescue
and
gave
us
clothes
and
we
went
with
friends
out
into
the
country
to
escape
the
epidemic
there
were
three
or
four
families
in
one
little
house
it
was
crowded
but
we
were
all
friends
so
it
was
nice
after
all
about
ten
years
before
hudgins
had
built
a
building
in
fayetteville
they
used
the
second
floor
for
an
opera
house
when
we
came
back
here
after
the
fire
we
took
it
over
to
run
hudgins
had
that
and
all
the
billboards
in
town
we
saw
all
the
shows
several
years
later
the
twins
helen
and
wade
were
born
i
always
went
to
see
the
shows
and
took
them
with
me
folks
watched
them
more
than
the
shows
i
kept
them
neat
and
clean
and
they
were
so
cute
we
saw
the
circuses
too
i
remember
once
barnum
and
bailey
were
coming
to
fort
smith
we
were
going
down
i
did
tell
anybody
but
i
put
in
my
purse
i
made
money
then
hudgins
got
me
a
cow
and
i
sold
milk
and
butter
and
kept
all
i
made
why
the
first
evening

when

they

a
class
of
white
people
known
as

they
would
catch
the

and
whip
them
i
never
saw
that
done
i
heard

talking
about
it
i
was
only
a
child
and
never
got
a
chance
to
see
the
slaves
on
the
places
of
other
people
but
just
heard
the
folks
talking
about
them
within
the
yankee
lines
when
the

broke
out
the
free
colored
people
became
fearful
there

he
volunteered
for
the

expecting
to

supposed
to
be
turned
out
like
wild
animals
like
they
were
i
think
it
was
forty
acres
and
a
mule
i
am
not
sure
but
i
know
they
expected
something
to
be
settled
on
them
what
they
got
if
any
of
them
got
anything
in
virginia
i
do
know
anything
about
it
they
might
have
been
some
slaves
that
did
get
something
just
like
they

i
pastored
him

there
were
others

i
do

fifty
cents
an
acre
and
sold
the

nat
turner
rebellion
i
have
heard
the
turner
rebellion
spoken
of
but
i
do
know
what
was
said
i
think
the
old
people
called
it
the
turner
war
reconstruction
days
lawyer
whipper
was
one
of
the
best
criminal
lawyers
in
the
state
he
was
a
negro
the
republican
party
had
the
state
then
and
the
negroes
were
strong
robert
small
was
a
noted
politician
and
was
elected
to
go
to
congress
twice
the
last
time
he
ran
he
was
elected
but
had
a
hard
fight
the
election
was
so
close
it
was
contested
but
small
won
out
he
was
the
last
nigger
congressman
i
heard
that
there
were
one
or
two
more
but
i
do
remember
them
when
i
first
went
to
south
carolina
them
niggers
was
bad
they
organized
they
used
to
have
an
association
known
as
the
union
laborers
i
think
the
organization
was
like
the
fraternal
order
i
do
they
ever
had
any
trouble
but
they
were
always
in
readiness
to
protect
themselves
if
any
conflict
arose
it
was
a
secret
order
carried
on
just
like
any
other
fraternal
order
they
had
distress
calls
every
member
has
an
old
horn
which
he
blew
in
time
of
trouble
i
think
that
sane
kind
of
organization
or
something
like
it
was
active
here
when
i
came
the
eagles
a
big
family
of
white
people
in
lonoke
county
had
a
fight
with
members
of
it
once
and
some
of
the
eagles
were
killed
a
year
or
two
before
i
came
to
this
state
voting
and
political
activities
i
voted
in
south
carolina

two
hundred

three
hundred

not
the

they

have
long

now
the

until
the

was
regularly
employed

to
learn
the
tricks
but
now
they

interviewer
comment
if
you
have
read
this
interview
hastily
and
have
missed
the
patroller
joke
on
page
three
turn
back
and
read
it
now
the
interviewer
considers
it
the
choicest
thing
in
the
story
that
and
the
story
of
an
unpensioned
union
veteran
and
the
insistence
on
the
word
son
seemed
to
me
to
set
this
story
off
as
a
little
out
of
the
ordinary
interviewer
annie
lacotts
person
interviewed
jonas
boone
st
charles
arkansas
age
most
any
day
in
charles
you
can
see
an
old
negro
man
coming
down
the
street
with
a
small
sack
made
of
bed
ticking
hanging
fashion
from
his
shoulder
this
is
old
uncle
jonas
boone
who
by
the
aid
of
his
heavy
cane
walks
to
town
and
makes
the
round
of
his
white
folks
homes
to
be
given
some
old
shoes
clothes
or
possibly
a
mess

dug

dig
lots
of

it
is
bad
luck

not
to

left

always
heard

and
believes
it
yet
he
ca
remember
when
he
first
heard

thinks

that
direct
your
life
and
if
you
do

the
evil
fates
let
you
be
punished

and
evil
spirits

and
then
i
could
help
in
school
till
they
got
to
united
states
money
another
thing
i
always
would
do
i
would
buy
these
block
a
b
c
everyone
learned
their
a
b
c
fore
they
went
to
school
i
reckon
i
a
man
in
a
lot
of
things
i
learnt
my
own
self
how
to
blacksmith
i
worked
for
a
man
for
nothin
just
so
i
could
learn
and
after
that
for
about
a
year
i
was
the
best
plow
sharpener
and
then
i
learned
how
to
carpenter
my
mother
was
awful
good
on
head
countin
and
she
learnt
me
when
i
was
a
little
fellow
my
oldest
brother
use
to
help
me
we
sit
by
the
fire
so
you
see
you
might
say
i
got
a
fireside
education
when
i
left
forrest
city
i
moved
to
england
and
made
one
crop
and
moved
to
baucum
and
made
one
crop
and
then
i
moved
on
the
sheridan
pike
three
miles
the
other
side
of
dew
drop
i
got
the
oil
fever
they
was
land
under
that
headin
sold
it
to
the
colored
folks
and
lots
o
these
bohemians
they
sho
is
fine
people
to
live
by
so
accommodatin
then
i
came
here
to
pine
bluff
in
i
hauled
wood
for
two
years
then
i
put
in
my
application
at
the
cotton
belt
shops
that

in
and
i
worked
there
fifteen
years

this
year
and

my
thoughts
i
have
two
daughters
in
camden

teaches
school
and
one
operates
a
beauty
parlor
all
six
of
my
children
finished
high
school
and
three
graduated
from
college
i
think
the
younger
generation
is
livin
too
fast
i
know
one
thing
they
has
done
they
wore
out
the
old
folks
old
folks
educate
and
ca
accumulate
anything
they
do
settle
much
now
till
they
marry
seems
like
the
young
folks
do
have
much
accommodation
i
tell
you
another
thing
the
children
are
carryin
out
things
like
they
use
to
i
think
when
us
old
folks
plays
out
this
world
is
goin
to
be
in
a
bad
shape
i
belong
out
here
to
the
catholic
church
the
oldest
church
in
the
world
i
use
to
belong
to
the
methodist
church
but
they
got
along
so
bad
i
got
tired
so
i
went
to
the
catholic
i
like
it
out
there
everthing
so
quiet
and
nice
name
of
interviewer
bernice
bowden
person
interviewed
rachel
bradley
state
street
pine
bluff
arkansas
age
upon
arriving
at
the
humble
unpainted
home
of
rachel
bradley
i
found
her
sitting
in
the
doorway
on
a
typical
bottomed
chair
watching
the
traffic
of
state
street
one
of
our
busiest
streets
out
of
the
high
rent
district
it
is
a
mixture
of
white
and
negro
stores
and
homes
after
asking
her
name
to
be
sure
i
was
really
talking
to
rachel
bradley
i
said
i
had
been
told
she
was
a
former
slave
yes
i
used
to
be
a
slave
she
smiled
broadly
displaying
nearly
a
full
set
of
teeth
she
is
of
a
cheerful
happy
disposition
and
seemed
glad
to
answer
my
questions
as
to
her
age
she
said
she
was
a
little
girl
on
the
floor
whan
the
stars
fell
i
looked
this
up
at
the
public
library
and
found
that
falling
stars
or
showers
of
meteors
occur
in
cycles
of
years
one
such
display
was
recorded
in
and
another
in
so
if
rachel
bradley
is
really
years
old
she
was
born
in
it
is
a
question
in
my
mind
whether
or
not
she
could
have
remembered
falling
stars
at
the
age
of
three
but
on
the
other
hand
if
she
was
a
little
girl
on
the
floor
in
she
would
be
only
somewhere
between
and
eighty
years
of
age
her
master
and
mistress
were
mitchell
and
elizabeth
simmons
and
they
had
two
sons
and
two
daughters
they
lived
on
a
plantation
about
twelve
miles
from
farmersville
louisiana
rachel
was
a
house
girl
and
her
mother
was
the
cook
besides
doing
house
work
she
was
nursemaid
and
as
she
grew
older
did
her
mistress
sewing
and
could
also
weave
and
knit
from
the
way
she
smiled
and
rolled
her
eyes
i
could
see
that
this
was
the
happiest
time
of
her
life
my
white
folks
was
so
good
to
me
i
sat
right
down
to
the
same
table
after
they
was
thru
while
a
child
in
the
home
of
her
white
folks
she
played
with
her
mistress
children
in
her
own
words
my
mistress
give
us
a
task
to
do
and
when
we
got
it
done
we
went
to
our
playhouse
in
the
yard
when
the
war
came
along
her
master
was
too
old
to
go
but
his
two
sons
went
and
both
lived
through
the
war
questioned
about
the
yankees
during
the
war
she
said
i
seen
right
smart
of
the
yankees
i
seen
the
go
by
they
did
bother
my
white
folks
none
rachel
said
the
abc
for
me
but
can
not
read
or
write
she
said
her
mistress
children
wanted
to
teach
her
but
she
would
rather
play
so
grew
up
in
ignorance
after
the
war
rachel
white
folks
moved
to
texas
and
rachel
went
to
live
with
her
mistress
married
daughter
martha
for
her
work
she
was
paid
six
dollars
a
month
she
was
not
given
any
money
by
her
former
owners
after
being
freed
but
was
paid
for
her
work
later
on
rachel
went
to
work
in
the
field
making
a
crop
with
her
brother
turning
it
over
to
the
owner
of
the
land
for
groceries
and
other
supplies
and
when
the
cotton
was
weighed
de
white
folks
taken
out
part
of
our
half
i
knowed
they
done
it
but
we
could
do
nothin
bout
it
rachel
had
four
husbands
and
eleven
children
her
second
husband
abandoned
her
taking
the
three
oldest
and
leaving
five
with
her
one
boy
and
one
girl
were
old
enough
to
help
their
mother
in
the
field
and
one
stayed
in
the
house
with
the
babies
so
she
managed
to
make
a
living
working
by
the
day
for
the
white
people
the
only
clash
with
the
ku
klux
klan
was
when
they
came
to
get
an
army
gun
her
husband
had
bought
being
a
woman
rachel
did
not
know
much
about
politics
during
the
reconstruction
period
she
had
heard
the
words
democrat
radical
and
republican
and
that
was
about
all
she
remembered
concerning
the
younger
generation
rachel
said
i
do
know
what
come
of
the
most
of
is
on
the
beat
trying
to
get
all
they
can
from
others
after
moving
to
arkansas
she
made
a
living
working
in
the
field
by
the
day
and
as
she
grew
older
washing
and
ironing
sewing
housecleaning
and
cooking
her
long
association
with
white
people
shows
in
her
speech
which
is
quite
plain
with
only
a
few
typical
negro
expressions
such
as
the
following
she
died
this
last
gone
sattiday
and
i
hope
help
shroud
her
when

they
told
the
colored
folks
they
was
free

take
what
they
wanted
from
the
white

they
had
us

playing
they
sang
the
song
hung
jeff
davis
on
a
sour
apple
tree
while
we
all
go
marching
on
it
was
the
white
folks
on
the
plantation
that
told
us
we
was
free
it
was
the
soldiers
their
selves
that
came

looking
for
him
but
they
did
find
him
another
man
got
into
an
argument
they
went
to
work
and
it
started
to
rain
the
negro
thought
that
they
would
stop
working
because
of
the
rain
so
he
started
home
the
man
he
was
working
for
met
him
and
asked
him
where
he
was
going
when
he
told
him
he
started
to
hit
him
with
the
butt
end
of
the
gun
he
was
wearing
the
negro
knocked
his
gun
up
took
it
away
from
him
and
drawed
down
and
started
to
kill
him
when
another
negro
knocked
the
gun
up
and
saved
the
white
man
life
but
the
nigger
might
as
well
have
killed
him
because
that
night
masked
men
hunted
him
he
was
hid
away
by
his
friends
until
he
got
a
chance
to
get
away
this
man
was
named
matthew
collins
there
was
another
case
this
was
a
political
one
the
colored
man
wanted
to
run
for
representative
of
some
kind
he
had
been
stump
speaking
he
lived
on
a
white
man
place
and
the
owner
came
to
him
and
told
him
he
had
better
get
away
because
a
mob
was
coming
after
him
not
just
he
told
his
wife
to
go
away
and
stay
with
his
brother
but
she
would
he
hid
himself
in
a
trunk
and
his
wife
was
under
the
floor
with
his
two
children
the
white
men
fired
into
the
house
and
that
did
do
anything
so
they
throwed
a
ball
of
fire
into
the
house
and
burned
his
wife
and
children
then
he
rose
up
and
came
out
of
the
trunk
and
hollered
look
out
i
coming
and
he
fired
a
load
of
buck
shot
and
tore
one
man
nearly
in
two
and
ran
away
in
the
confusion
the
next
day
he
went
to
the
man
on
whose
place
he
lived
but
he
told
him
he
could
do
anything
about
it
another
man
by
the
name
of
bob
sawyer
had
a
farm
near
my
home
and
another
farm
down
near
maginty
place
he
worked
the
tr
illegible
niggers
from
one
farm
to
the
other
his
boy
would
ride
in
front
with
a
rifle
and
he
would
be
in
the
rear
with
a
big
gun
swinging
down
from
his
hip
there
wae
one
nigger
who
got
out
and
went
down
to
alexandria
louisiana
he
wrote
to
the
officers
and
they
caught
the
nigger
and
put
him
into
the
stocks
and
brought
him
back
and
the
man
had
done
a
thing
but
run
away
after
that
they
worked
him
with
a
chain
holding
his
legs
together
so
that
he
could
only
make
short
steps
they
had
an
old
white
man
who
worked
there
and
they
treated
him
so
mean
he
ran
away
and
left
his
wife
they
treated
the
poor
whites
about
as
bad
as
they
treated
the
colored
if
bob
met
a
negro
carrying
cotton
to
the
gin
he
would
ask
whose
cotton
is
that
and
if
the
nigger
said
it
was
some
white
man
he
would
let
him
alone
but
if
he
said
mine
bob
would
tell
him
to
take
it
to
some
gin
where
he
wanted
it
taken
he
was
the
kind
of
man
that
if
you
seen
him
first
you
would
meet
him
one
night
he
slipped
up
on
a
nigger
man
that
had
left
his
place
and
killed
him
as
he
sat
at
supper
i
had
an
aunt
with
five
or
six
children
who
worker
with
him
he
married
my
young
mistress
after
i
was
freed
i
saw
him
do
this
the
white
folks
had
a
funeral
at
the
church
down
there
one
sunday
he
came
along
and
young
billie
ward
white
man
was
sitting
in
a
buggy
driving
with
his
wife
when
he
saw
billie
he
jumped
down
out
of
his
buggy
and
him
until
he
ran
away
all
the
while
sawyer
was
sitting
in
his
buggy
calling
out
shoot
him
bob
shoot
him
this
was
because
billie
and
another
man
had
done
some
talk
about
bob
occupations
i
came
to
brinkley
arkansas
march
and
have
been
in
arkansas
ever
since
why
i
came
the
postmaster
where
i
was
rented
farm
on
which
i
was
farming
in
march
he
put
hands
in
my
field
to
pick
my
cotton
all
that
was
in
the
field
was
mine
i
knew
that
i
could
do
anything
about
it
so
i
left
a
couple
of
years
before
that
i
rented
five
acres
of
land
from
him
for
three
dollars
as
acre
verbal
agreement
sowed
it
down
in
cotton
it
done
so
well
i
made
five
bales
of
cotton
on
it
he
saw
the
prospects
were
so
good
that
he
went
to
the
man
who
furnished
me
supplies
and
told
him
that
i
had
agreed
to
do
my
work
on
a
third
and
fourth
of
the
seed
and
of
the
cotton
to
go
to
the
owner
he
get
this
although
if
he
had
stuck
to
the
agreement
he
would
not
have
gotten
but
fifteen
dollars
so
he
dealt
me
a
blow
there
but
i
got
over
it
before
this
i
had
bought
a
piece
of
timber
land
in
moorehouse
parish
louisiana
and
was
expecting
to
get
the
money
to
finish
paying
for
it
from
my
cotton
the
cost
was
so
when
he
put
hands
in
my
field
it
made
me
mad
and
i
left
brooks
would
have
lost
most
of
his
cotton
if
the
hands
had
picked
it
at
brinkley
i
farmed
on
halves
with
will
carter
one
of
the
richest
men
in
monroe
county
arkansas
i
done
worth
of
work
for
carter
and
he
paid
me
for
it
then
he
turned
around
and
charged
me
up
with
it
when
we
came
to
settle
up
we
could
settle
so
finally
he
said
figures
do
lie
and
i
said
no
figures
do
lie
but
men
do
when
i
sed
that
i
stepped
out
and
did
get
scared
until
i
was
half
way
home
but
nobody
did
anything
he
sent
for
me
but
i
would
go
back
because

knew
what
he
was
doing
after
that
i
went

by
and
everything
jake
readus
came
by
and
told
me
what
the
niggers

of
some
of

superstitions
if
you

person
a
cat
looks
at
after
he
has
licked
hisself
you
are
going

if
you
put
a
kitten
under
the
cover
of
your
bed
and
leave
it
until
it
crawls
out
by
itself
it
will
never
leave
home
if
you
walk
through
a
place
where
a

wallows
you
will
have

and
he
will
stop
if
a

it
is
a

luck
if

place
given
by

brown
aunt
elcie
brown
a
negro
girl
age
nine
years
old
was
living
in
the
clay
hills
of
arkansas
close
to
centerville
and
clinton
in
amid
county
on
johnnie
reeves
place
johnnie
reeves
was
old
and
had
a
son
named
henry
reeves
who
was
married
young
reeves
got
the
news
that
they
were
to
be
attacked
by
the
yankees
at
a
certain
time
and
he
took
his
family
and
all
the
best
stock
such
as
horses
cattle
and
sheep
to
a
cave
in
a
bluff
which
was
hid
from
the
of
the
yankees
by
woods
all
around
it
johnnie
reeves
was
left
to
be
attacked
by
the
soldiers
he
was
blind
and
almost
paralyzed
he
had
to
eat
dried
beef
shaved
real
fine
and
the
negro
children
fed
him
they
ate
as
much
of
it
as
he
did
aunt
elcie
and
her
brother
fed
him
most
of
the
time
they
would
get
on
each
side
of
him
and
lead
him
for
a
walk
most
every
day
the
natives
thought
they
would
bluff
the
soldiers
and
cut
the
bridge
into
and
thought
that
the
soldiers
would
be
unable
to
cross
beavers
creek
but
the
yankees
was
prepared
they
had
made
a
long
bridge
for
the
soldiers
to
come
marching
right
over
this
bridge
was
just
a
mile
from
reeves
farm
then
the
soldiers
came
they
were
so
many
that
they
could
not
all
come
up
the
big
road
but
part
of
them
came
over
the
hill
by
the
sheeps
spring
and
through
the
pasture
all
the
negroes
came
out
of
their
shacks
and
watched
them
march
toward
their
houses
elcie
and
her
brother
got
scared
and
ran
in
the
house
crawled
in
bed
and
thought
they
were
hid
as
they
had
scrutched
down
in
the
middle
of
the
bed
with
the
door
locked
but
the
soldiers
bursted
in
and
moved
the
bed
from
the
corner
one
stood
over
the
bed
and
laughed
then
asked
the
other
man
to
look
then
threw
the
covers
off
of
them
he
first
took
her
brother
by
one
arm
and
one
leg
and
stood
him
on
his
feet
patted
his
head
and
told
him
not
to
be
afraid
that
they
would
not
hurt
them
then
took
elcie
and
stood
her
up
he
reached
in
a
bag
lined
with
fur
which
was
strapped
on
them
and
gave
them
both
a
stick
of
candy
elcie
says
she
thinks
that
is
why
she
has
always
liked
stick
candy
she
also
says
that
that
day
has
stood
out
to
her
and
she
can
see
everything
just
like
it
was
yesterday
all
the
negro
homes
were
close
together
and
the
soldiers
raided
them
in
small
bunches
they
were
kind
to
the
negro
children
wnen
they
started
to
the
big
house
where
johnnie
reeves
lived
all
the
negro
children
followed
them
when
they
entered
the
house
reeves
was
sitting
by
the
side
of
the
and
every
one
that
passed
him
kicked
him
brutely
they
ransacked
the
place
all
over
and
when
they
got
up
stairs
they
kicked
out
all
the
window
pains
and
tore
off
all
the
they
took
all
the
things
they
wanted
out
of
the
house
such
as
and
jewelry
the
and
was
three
separate
buildings
in
a
row
the
first
one
they
entered
was
the
it
had
seven
shelves
of
milk
cream
and
butter
in
it
there
was
eleven
crocks
of
sweet
milk
larger
than
a
waterbucket
they
had
forty
gallons
of
butter
milk
and
over
three
gallons
of
butter
in
a
large
flat
crock
they
also
had
over
five
gallons
of
cream
the
yankee
soldiers
ate
all
the
butter
and
cream
and
set
the
milk
in
the
yard
and
ask
the
negro
kids
to
finish
the
milk
they
drank
it
like
pigs
without
a
cup
just
stuck
their
heads
down
and
drank
like
pigs
when
they
were
full
the
balance
of
the
milk
was
so
dirty
it
looked
like
pigs
had
been
in
it
the
soldiers
entered
the
next
building
which
was
the
where
they
stored
rice
flour
sugar
coffee
and
such
like
and
they
took
what
they
wanted
then
destroyed
the
rest
reeves
had
just
been
to
town
and
bought
a
hogshead
of
sugar
and
they
took
it
out
and
burst
it
and
invited
the
negro
children
to
help
themselves
elcie
says
that
when
the
kids
all
got
full
there
was
not
a
half
bushel
left
the
last
raid
was
the
where
stuffed
sausage
was
hanging
by
the
hundred
and
hams
by
the
dozens
they
did
leave
a
thing
took
lard
and
everything
it
took
over
two
wagons
to
hold
everything
then
they
crossed
over
to
the
next
place
owned
by
bill
gunley
levy
tells
me
of
his
father
being
partial
to
the
southerners
although
he
lived
in
evansville
indiana
and
fought
as
a
yankee
he
was
accused
of
being
partial
and
they
would
turn
over
his
wagons
and
cause
him
trouble
he
had
fine
wagons
and
sometimes
when
he
would
be
turning
his
wagons
back
up
after
them
being
turned
over
to
contrary
him
he
would
curse
grant
and
call
him
that
old
tobacco
spitter
although
henry
levy
seldom
did
swear
as
he
was
french
sometimes
they
would
make
him
mad
and
he
would
do

my
father
lived
to
see
freedom
he
has
been
dead
more
than
twelve
years
he
died
at
my
home
he
was
so
close
to
the
fighting
that
he
could
hear
the
guns
and
the
firing
when
they
was
freed
some
white
people
told
him
are
just
as
free
as
we
are
i
was
born
after
the
emancipation
proclamation
the
proclamation
was
issued
in
september
and
i
was
born
in
october
it
did
become
effective
till
january
first
so
i
was
born
a
slave
any
way
you
take
it
the
farm
my
father
worked
on
was
on
the
pearl
river
it
was
very
fertile
it
was
in
mississippi
a
very
big
road
runs
beside
the
farm
the
road
is
called
the
big
road
the
nigger
quarters
were
across
the
road
on
the
south
side
my
mother
folks
treated
her
nicely
too
rankins
did
have
any
slaves
but
rankins
had
some
her
people
gave
them
to
her
my
grandma
who
belonged
to
her
had
children
she
got
her
start
off
of
the
slaves
her
parents
gave
her
and
finally
she
had
about
she
ran
a
farm
my
mother
work
was
house
woman
she
worked
in
the
house
her
mistress
was
good
to
her
the
overseer
whip
the
niggers
except
in
her
presence
so
that
she
could
see
that
it
was
brutal
she
did
allow
the
women
to
be
whipped
at
all
when
an
overseer
got
rough
she
would
fire
him
slaves
would
run
away
sometimes
and
stay
in
the
woods
if
they
thought
that
they
would
get
a
whipping
for
it
but
she
would
send
word
for
them
to
come
on
back
and
they
be
whipped
and
she
would
keep
her
word
about
it
the
slaves
on
her
place
were
treated
so
good
that
they
were
called
free
niggers
by
the
other
white
people
when
they
were
whipped
they
would
go
to
the
woods
i
have
heard
them
speak
of
the
pateroles
often
they
had
to
get
a
pass
and
then
the
pateroles
would
bother
them
they
would
whip
you
and
beat
you
if
you
did
have
a
pass
slavery
was
an
awful
low
thing
it
was
a
bad
system
you
had
to
get
a
pass
to
go
to
see
your
wife
if
you
did
have
that
pass
they
would
whip
you
the
pateroles
carried
on
their
work
for
a
good
while
after
slavery
was
over
and
the
civil
war
had
ended
i
was
pretty
good
when
i
was
a
boy
so
i
never
had
any
trouble
then
i
was
right
smart
size
when
i
saw
the
ku
klux
they
would
whip
men
and
women
that
were
married
and
were
living
together
on
the
first
day
of
january
they
would
whip
men
and
boys
that
did
have
a
job
they
kept
the
negroes
from
voting
they
would
whip
them
they
put
up
notices
niggers
to
come
out
to
the
polls
tomorrow
they
would
run
them
off
of
government
land
which
they
had
homesteaded
sometimes
they
would
just
persuade
them
not
to
vote
a
negro
like
my
father
they
would
say
to
him
brown
you
are
too
good
to
get
messed
up
them
other
niggers
here
ai
worth
nothing
but
you
are
and
we
do
want

from
the
polls
tomorrow
and
tomorrow
my
father
would
stay
away
under
the
circumstances
they
had
to
depend
on
the
white
people
for
counsel
they
did
know
what
to
do
themselves
the
other
niggers
they
would
threaten
them

it
hard
for

the
bigger
crooks
they
is
we

mother
thought
she

too
young
to
have
to
do
that
way
mother
stole
her
away
the
first
year
of
the
civil

and
let
her
go
with
some
acquaintances
of
hers
they
was
colored

was
so
good

did
seem
like
slavery
the
plantation
belong
to
the
woman
he
was
a
preacher
he
rode
a
circuit
and
was
gone
they
had
a

was
a
good
man
mother
said
over
in
sight
on
a
joining
farm
the
overseers
whooped
somebody
every
day
and
more
than
that
sometimes
she
said
some
of
the
white

overseers
was
cruel
mother
quilted
for
people
and
washed
and
ironed
to
raise
us
after

mother
sent
for
my
sister
i
do
recollect
this
but
mother
said
when
she
heard
of

she
took
me
in
her
arms
and
left
the
first
i
can
recollect
she
was
cooking
for
soldiers
at
the
camps
at
montgomery
alabama
they
had
several
cooks
we
lived
in
our
own
house
and
mother
washed
and
ironed
for
them
some
too
they
paid
her
well
for
her
work
i
recollect
some
of
the
good
eating
we
had
big
white
rice
and
big
soda
crackers
and
the
best
meat
i
ever
et
it
was
pickled
pork
it
was
preserved
in
brine
and
shipped
to
the
soldiers
in
hogheads
barrels
we
lived
there
till
mother
died
and
i
can
recollect
that
much
when
mother
died
we
had
a
hard
time
i
look
back
now
and
do
see
how
we
made
it
through
we
washed
and
ironed
mostly
and
had
a
mighty
little
bit
to
eat
and
nearly
nothing
to
wear
it
was
hard
times
for
us
three
children
i
was
the
baby
child
my
brother
hired
out
when
he
could
we
stuck
together
till

or
over

ark
one
morning
early
i
irene
robertson
got
off
the
bus
and
started
up
main
street
i
had
gone
far
before
i
noticed
a
small
form
of
a
woman
she
wore
men
heavy
shoes
an
old
dark
dress
and
a
large
fringed
woolen
shawl
the
fringe
was
well
gone
and
the
shawl
once
black
was
now
brown
with
age
i
passed
her
and
looked
back
into
her
face
i
saw
she
was
a
negro
dark
brown
her
face
was
small
with
unusually
nice
features
for
a
woman
of
her
race
she
carried
a
slick
knotted
heavy
walking
stick
a
very
one
on
the
other
arm
was
a
rectangular
split
basket
with
wires
run
through
for
a
handle
and
wrapped
with
a
dirty
white
rag
to
keep
the
wire
from
cutting
into
her
hand
or
arm
i
stopped
and
said
auntie
could
you
direct
me
to
molly
house
i
her
she
replied
well
i
want
to
go
home
with
you
what
you
want
to
go
out
there
for
i
want
you
to
tell

for

well
you
go
ahead
and
i
follow
along
very
well
she
said
i
window
shopped
outside
and
i
noticed
she
had
a
box
of
candy
but
it
was
a
box
and
had
been
opened
so
i
thought
it
may
be
nearly
anything
just
put
in
the
box
the
next
store
she
went
into
was
a
meat
market
and
grocery
combined
i
followed
in
behind
her
a
man
gave
her
a
bundle
that
was
large
enough
to
hold
a
meat
roast
it
was
neatly
tied
and
the
wrapping
paper
was
white
i
observed
she
thanked
him
she
turned
to
me
and
said
give
me
a
nickel
i
said
i
do
have
one
then
i
said
teasingly
why
you
think
i
have
a
nickel
she
said
you
look
like
it
i
opened
my
purse
and
gave
her
a
dime
she
went
over
to
the
bread
and
picked
up
a
loaf
or
two
feeling
it
the
same
man
said
let
that
alone
the
old
woman
slowly
went
on
out
i
was
amazed
at
his
scolding
then
he
said
to
me
she
begs
up
and
down
this
street
every
day
cold
or
hot
rain
or
shine
and
i
have
to

her
from
the
time

enters
that
door
till

added
how
old
is
she
she
was
about
fifty
years
old
sixty
years
ago
when
she
came
to
brinkley
she
is
close

loose
her
she
had
gained
time
on
me
and
was
crossing
the
cotton
belt
ry
tracks

caught
up
with

before

went
into
a
small
country
grocery

wormed
and
went
on

time

give

money
with

i
asked
if

about

it
runs
out
before

grassy
mesa

old
woman
said
here
and
handed
over

tall
footstool
she

a
old
mule
named
jane
when
the
yankees
would
come
down
bill
neely
and
all
his
friends
would
leave
home
they
would
leave
when
they
would
hear
the
cannon
because
they
said
that
meant
the
yankees
were
coming
when
neely
went
away
he
would
carry
my
mother
to

cooking
she
would
leave
the
children
there
and
carry
just
the
baby
when
she
went
old
aunt
malinda
she
was
our

she
was
just
an
old
lady
we

for
us
while
she
was

when
the

my
original
name
was
not
brown
it
was
pope
i
became
brown
after
the
war
was
over
i
moved
on
the
old
barnes
farm
when
the
soldiers
were
mustered
out
in
the
end
of
the
war
a
lot
of
soldiers
worked
on
that
place
peter
brown
an
old
colored
soldier
mustered
out
from
memphis
met
my
mother
courted
her
and
married
her
all
the
other
children
that
were
born
to
her
were
called
brown
and
the
people
called
her
brown
and
just
called
all
the
other
children
brown
too
including
me
and
i
just
let
it
go
that
way
but
my
father
was
named
harrison
pope
he
died
in
the
confederate
army
out
there
somewheres
around
little
rock
he
had
violated
some
of
the
military
laws
and
they
put
him
in
that
thing
they
had
to
punish
them
by
and
when
they
taken
him
out
he
contracted
pneumonia
and
died
i
do
know
where
he
is
buried
i
would
to
god
i
did
you
know
when
these
southern
armies
went
along
they
carried
colored
stevedores
to
do
the
work
for
them
patrollers
i
was
a
little
fellow
in
the
time
of
the
pateroles
if
the
slaves
wanted
to
go
out
anywhere
they
had
to
get
a
pass
and
they
had
to
be
back
at
a
certain
time
if
they
did
get
back
it
would
be
some
kind
of
punishment
the
pateroles
was
a
mighty
bad
thing
if
they
caught
you
when
you
were
out
without
a
pass
they
would
whip
you
unmercifully
and
if
you
were
out
too
late
they
would
whip
you
wherever
colored
people
had
a
gathering
them
pateroles
would
be
there
looking
on
to
see
if
they
could
find
anybody
without
a
pass
if
they
did
find
anybody
that
could
show
a
pass
they
would
take
him
right
out
and
whip
him
then
and
there
ku
klux
i
know
the
ku
klux
must
have
been
in
use
before
the
war
because
i
remember
the
business
when
i
was
a
little
bit
of
a
fellow
they
had
a
place
out
there
on
crowley
ridge
they
used
to
meet
at
they
tried
to
make
the
impression
that
they
would
be
old
confederate
soldiers
that
had
been
killed
in
the
battle
of
shiloh
and
they
used
to
ride
down
from
the
ridge
hollering
lordy
lordy
lordy
they
would
have
on
those
old
uniforms
and
would
call
for
water
and
they
would
have
some
way
of
pouring
the
water
down
in
a
bag
or
something
underneath
their
uniforms
so
that
it
would
look
like
they
could
drink
four
or
five
gallons
one
night
when
they
come
galloping
down
on
their
horses
hollering
lordy
lordy
like
they
used
to
some
yankee
soldiers
stationed
nearby
tied
ropes
across
the
road
and
killed
about
of
the
horses
and
broke
legs
and
arms
of
about
ten
or
fifteen
they
never
used
the
ridge
any
more

old
slave
house
was
a
log
house
built
out
of
hewed
logs
the
logs
were
scalped
on
each
side
to
give
it
the
appearance
of
a
box
house
and
they
said
the
logs
would
fit
together
better
too
they
would
chink
up
the
cracks
with
grass
and
dirt
what
they
called

is
what
they
called
chinking
to
keep
the

other
places

i
got
the
degreee
of
and
at
the
age
of
i
have
preached
for
years
and
actually
pastored
for
years
i
followed
farming
in
my
early
days
when
i
first
married
my
wife
we
farmed
there
for
ten
or
twelve
years
before
i
entered
the
ministry
i
have
been

years
marriage
i
was
married
january
i
am
now
in
the
year
of
marriage
my
wife
was
named
mary
ellen
stubbs
she
was
from
baldwyn
mississippi
they
moved
from
mississippi
about
the
winter
of
and
they
made
one
crop
in
arkansas
before
we
married
they
stopped
in
our
county
and
attended
our
church
i
met
her
in
that
way
the
most
remarkable
thing
was
that
during
the
time
i
was
acquainted
with
her
our
pastor
became
incapacitated
and
i
took
charge
of
the
church
i
ran
a
revival
and
she
was
converted
during
the
revival
but
she
joined
the
church
i
belong
to
the
slave
sales
i
remember
my
mother
carrying
the
children
from
the
bill
neely
place
to
the
pope
place
that
saturday
evening
after
we
got
there
there
came
along
some
slave
traders
they
had
with
them
as
i
remember
some
ten
or
twelve
boys
and
girls
and
some
old
folks
that
were
able
to
work
they
had
them
chained
i
asked
my
mother
what
they
were
going
to
do
with
them
and
she
said
they
were
carrying
them
to
louisiana
to
work
on
a
cane
farm
one
boy
cried
a
lot
the
next
morning
they
put
those
slaves
in
the
road
and
drove
them
down
to
wittsbarg
the
same
as
you
would
drive
a
drove
of
cattle
wittsburg
was
where
they
caught
the
boat
to
go
down
to
louisiana
that
was
the
best
mode
of
travel
in
those
days
opinions
in
a
few
words
my
opinion
of
the
present
is
that
our
existence
as
democrats
and
republicans
is
about
played
out
if
roosevelt
is
elected
for
a
third
term
i
think
we
will
go
into
a
dictatorship
just
as
russia
germany
and
italy
have
already
done
i
think
we
are
nearer
to
that
now
than
we
heve
ever
been
before
i
do
not
think
that
roosevelt
will
become
a
dictator
but
i
do
believe
that
his
being
elected
a
third
time
will
cause
some
one
else
to
become
dictator
my
opinion
is
that
he
is
neither
democrat
nor
republican
our
young
people
are
advancing
from
a
literary
point
of
view
but
i
claim
that
they
are
losing
out
along
moral
lines
i
do
believe
that
we
value
morals
as
well
as
the
people
did
years
ago
who
did
know
so
much
i
believe
that
the
whole
nation
white
and
black
is
losing
moral
stamina
they
do
not
think
it
is
bad
to
kill
a
man
take
another
wife
or
rob
a
bank
or
anything
else
they
desecrate
the
churches
by
carrying
anything
into
the
church
there
is
no
sacred
place
now
carnivals
and
everything
else
are
carried
to
the
church
if
roosevelt
is
not
reelected
again
the
country
is
going
to
have
one
of
the
bloodiest
wars
it
has
ever
had
because
we
have
so
many
european
doctrines
coming
into
the
united
states
i
have
been
living
years
and
i
never
thought
that
i
would
live
to
see
the
day
when
the
government
would
reach
out
and
take
hold
of
things
like
it
has
done
the
wpa
the
fera
and
the
rfc
and
other
work
going
on
today
we
are
headed
for
communism
and
we
are
going
to
get
in
a
bloody
war
there
are
hundreds
of
men
going
who
believe
in
communism
but
who
do
want
it
to
be
known
now

think
so
we
had
plenty
plain
victuals
at
the
hotel
he
meant
to
be
good
to
me
but
i
expected
too
much
i
reckon
then
it
being
a
public
place
i
heard
lots
what
was
said
around

come
to
think

be
treated
good
as
the

see
it
different
spence

on
a
stick
and
a

he
mean
a
bit
i
was
the
bellboy
and
swept
some
and
gardened

they

had
to
work
harder
they
never
give
me
nothing
i

spence
twice
after

me
i
was
free
i
did
leave
i
did
have
sense
to
know
where
to
go
i
did
know
what
freedom
was
so
he
went
to
the
free
mens
bureau
and
had
me
bound
to
him
till
i
was
years
old
he
told
me
what
he
had
done
he
was
to
clothe
me
feed
me
send
me
to
school
so
many
months
a
year
give
me
a
horse
and
bridle
and
saddle
and
one
hundred
fifty
dollars
when
i
was
years
old
that
would
have
been
eight
or
nine
years
seemed
too
long
a
time
to
wait
i
thought
i
could
do
better
than
that
i
never
done
half
that
good
i
never
went
to
school
a
day
in
my
life
i
was
sorry
i
run
off
after
it
was
too
late
i
heard
too
much
talking
at
the
hotel
they
argued
a
whole
heap
more
than
they
do
now
they
set
around
and
talk
about
slavery
and
freedom
and
everything
else
it
made
me
restless
and
i
run
off
i
was
ashamed
to
be
seen
much
less
go
back
folks
used
to
have
shame

klux
in

welch
one

afraid
of
them

i
was
afraid
of
i
learned
a
good
deal
about
it
they
called
it
uprising

i
found
out
their
purpose
was
to
hold
down
the
nigger

them
submissive

thought
it
out
that

reasonably
good
to
me

i
did
think

then
it
was
a
restlessness
then
like
