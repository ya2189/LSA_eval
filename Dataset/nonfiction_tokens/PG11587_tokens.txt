the
part
of
good
citizens
a
people
without
children
would
face
a
hopeless
future
a
country
without
trees
is
almost
as
helpless
forests
which
are
so
used
that
they
can
not
renew
themselves
will
soon
vanish
and
with
them
all
their
benefits
when
you
help
to
preserve
our

new
ones
you
are

the

theodore
roosevelt
introduction
our
forests
with
their
billions
of
trees
are
the
backbone
of
agriculture
the
skeleton
of
lumbering
and
the
heart
of
industry
even
now
in
spite
of
their
depletion
they
are
the
cream
of
our
natural
resources
they
furnish
wood
for
the
nation
pasture
for
thousands
of
cattle
and
sheep
and
water
supply
for
countless
cities
and
farms
they
are
the
dominions
of
wild
life
millions
of
birds
game
animals
and
fish
live
in
the
forests
and
the
forest
streams
the
time
is
coming
when
our
forests
will
be
the
greatest
playgrounds
of
america
it
is
necessary
that
we
preserve
protect
and
expand
our
timberlands
by
so
doing
we
shall
provide
for
the
needs
of
future
generations
the
forest
is
one
of
the
most
faithful
friends
of
man
it
provides
him
with
materials
to
build
homes
it
furnishes
fuel
it
aids
agriculture
by
preventing
floods
and
storing
the
surplus
rainfall
in
the
soil
for
the
use
of
farm
crops
it
supplies
the
foundation
for
all
our
railroads
it
is
the
producer
of
fertile
soils
it
gives
employment
to
millions
of
workmen
it
is
a
resource
which
bountifully
repays
kind
treatment
it
is
the
best
organized
feature
of
the
plant
world
the
forest
is
not
merely
a
collection
of
different
kinds
of
trees
it
is
a
permanent
asset
which
will
yield
large
returns
over
long
periods
when
properly
managed
our
forest
fortune
has
been
thoughtlessly
squandered
by
successive
generations
of
spendthrifts
fortunately
it
is
not
too
late
to
rebuild
it
through
co√∂perative
effort
the
work
has
been
well
begun
but
it
is
a
work
of
years
and
it
is
to
the
youth
of
the
country
that
we
must
look
for
its
continuous
expansion
and
perpetuation
a
part
of
our
effort
must
be
directed
toward
familiarizing
them
with
the
needs
and
rewards
of
an
intelligent
forestry
policy

how
trees
grow
and
multiply
the
trees
of
the
forest
grow
by
forming
new
layers
of
wood
directly
under
the
bark
trees
are
held
upright
in
the
soil
by
means
of
roots
which
reach
to
a
depth
of
many
feet
where
the
soil
is
loose
and
porous
these
roots
are
the
supports
of
the
tree
they
hold
it
rigidly
in
position
they
also
supply
the
tree
with
food
through
delicate
hairs
on
the
roots
they
absorb
soil
moisture
and
plant
food
from
the
earth
and
pass
them
along
to
the
tree
the
body
of
the
tree
acts
as
a
passage
way
through
which
the
food
and
drink
are
conveyed
to
the
top
or
crown
the
crown
is
the
place
where
the
food
is
digested
and
the
regeneration
of
trees
effected
the
leaves
contain
a
material
known
as
chlorophyll
which
in
the
presence
of
light
and
heat
changes
mineral
substances
into
plant
food
chlorophyll
gives
the
leaves
their
green
color
the
cells
of
the
plant
that
are
rich
in
chlorophyll
have
the
power
to
convert
gas
into
carbon
and
oxygen
these
cells
combine
the
carbon
and
the
soil
water
into
chemical
mixtures
which
are
partially
digested
when
they
reach
the
crown
of
the
tree
the
water
containing
salts
which
is
gathered
by
the
roots
is
brought
up
to
the
leaves
here
it
combines
with
the
gas
taken
from
the
air
under
the
action
of
chlorophyll
and
sunlight
these
substances
are
split
up
the
carbon
oxygen
and
hydrogen
being
combined
into
plant
food
it
is
either
used
immediately
or
stored
away
for
future
emergency
trees
breathe
somewhat
like
human
beings
they
take
in
oxygen
and
give
off
gas
the
air
enters
the
tree
through
the
leaves
and
small
openings
in
the
bark
which
are
easily
seen
in
such
trees
as
the
cherry
and
birch
trees
breathe
constantly
but
they
digest
and
assimilate
food
only
during
the
day
and
in
the
presence
of
light
in
the
process
of
digestion
and
assimilation
they
give
off
oxygen
in
abundance
but
they
retain
most
of
the
carbonic
acid
gas
which
is
a
plant
food
and
whatever
part
of
it
is
not
used
immediately
is
stored
up
by
the
tree
and
used
for
its
growth
and
development
trees
also
give
off
their
excess
moisture
through
the
leaves
and
bark
otherwise
they
would
become
waterlogged
during
periods
when
the
water
is
rising
rapidly
from
the
roots
after
the
first
year
trees
grow
by
increasing
the
thickness
of
the
older
buds
increase
in
height
and
density
of
crown
cover
is
due
to
the
development
of
the
younger
twigs
new
growth
on
the
tree
is
spread
evenly
between
the
wood
and
bark
over
the
entire
body
of
the
plant
this
process
of
wood
production
resembles
a
factory
enterprise
in
which
three
layers
of
material
are
engaged
in
the
first
two
of
these
delicate
tissues
the
wood
is
actually
made
the
inner
side
of
the
middle
layer
produces
new
wood
while
the
outer
side
grows
bark
the
third
layer
is
responsible
for
the
production
of
the
tough
outer
bark
year
after
year
new
layers
of
wood
are
formed
around
the
first
layers
this
first
layer
finally
develops
into
heartwood
which
so
far
as
growth
is
concerned
is
dead
material
its
cells
are
blocked
up
and
prevent
the
flow
of
sap
it
aids
in
supporting
the
tree
the
living
sapwood
surrounds
the
heartwood
each
year
one
ring
of
this
sapwood
develops
this
process
of
growth
may
continue
until
the
annual
layers
amount
to
or
or
more
according
to
the
life
of
the
tree
one
can
tell
the
age
of
a
tree
by
counting
the
number
of
annual
rings
sometimes
because
of
the
interruption
of
normal
growth
two
false
rings
may
be
produced
instead
of
a
single
true
ring
however
such
blemishes
are
easy
for
the
trained
eye
to
recognize
heartwood
does
not
occur
in
all
varieties
of
trees
in
some
cases
where
both
heartwood
and
sapwood
appear
it
is
difficult
to
distinguish
between
them
as
their
colors
are
so
nearly
alike
because
it
takes
up
so
much
moisture
and
plant
food
sapwood
rots
much
more
quickly
than
heartwood
the
sapwood
really
acts
as
a
pipe
line
to
carry
water
from
the
roots
to
the
top
of
the
tree
in
some
of
our
largest
trees
the
moisture
is
raised
as
high
as
feet
or
more
through
the
sapwood
strange
though
it
may
seem
trees
fight
with
each
other
for
a
place
in
the
sunlight
sprightly
trees
that
shoot
skyward
at
a
swift
pace
are
the
ones
that
develop
into
the
monarchs
of
the
forest
they
excel
their
mates
in
growth
because
at
all
times
they
are
exposed
to
plenty
of
light
the
less
fortunate
trees
that
are
more
stocky
and
sturdy
and
less
speedy
in
their
climb
toward
the
sky
are
killed
out
in
large
numbers
each
year
the
weaker
spindly
trees
of
the
forest
which
are
slow
growers
often
are
smothered
out
by
the
more
vigorous
trees
some
trees
are
able
to
grow
in
the
shade
they
develop
near
or
under
the
large
trees
of
the
forest
when
the
giants
of
the
woodland
die
these
smaller
trees
which
previously
were
shaded
develop
rapidly
as
a
result
of
their
freedom
from
suppression
in
many
cases
they
grow
almost
as
large
and
high
as
the
huge
trees
that
they
replace
in
our
eastern
forests
the
hemlock
often
follows
the
white
pine
in
this
way
spruce
trees
may
live
for
many
years
in
dense
shade
then
finally
when
they
have
access
to
plenty
of
light
they
may
develop
into
sturdy
trees
a
tree
that
is
a
pigmy
in
one
locality
may
rank
as
a
giant
in
another
region
due
to
different
conditions
of
growth
and
climate
for
example
the
canoe
birch
at
its
northern
limit
is
a
runt
it
never
grows
higher
than
a
few
feet
above
the
ground
under
the
most
favorable
conditions
in
florida
where
this
species
thrives
such
trees
often
tower
to
a
height
of
feet
in
sheltered
regions
the
seeds
of
trees
may
fall
sprout
and
take
root
close
to
their
parent
trees
as
a
rule
the
wind
plays
a
prominent
part
in
distributing
seed
in
every
section
of
the
country
pine
and
fir
seeds
are
equipped
with
wings
like
those
of
a
bird
or
an
airplane
they
enable
the
seeds
to
fly
long
distances
on
the
wind
before
they
drop
to
the
ground
and
are
covered
with
leaves
maple
seeds
fly
by
means
of
sails
which
carry
them
far
afield
before
they
settle
ash
seeds
have
peculiar
appendages
which
act
like
a
in
transporting
them
to
distant
sections
cottonwood
seeds
have
downy
wings
which
aid
their
flight
while
basswood
seeds
are
distributed
over
the
country
by
means
of
wings
the
pods
of
the
locust
tree
fall
on
the
frozen
ground
or
snow
crust
and
are
blown
long
distances
from
their
source
on
the
other
hand
oak
hickory
and
chestnut
trees
produce
heavy
seeds
which
generally
remain
where
they
fall
squirrels
are
the
most
industrious
foresters
in
the
animal
world
each
year
they
bury
great
quantities
of
tree
seeds
in
hoards
or
caches
hidden
away
in
hollow
logs
or
in
the
moss
and
leaves
of
the
forest
floor
birds
also
scatter
tree
seed
here
there
and
everywhere
over
the
forests
and
the
surrounding
country
running
streams
and
rivers
carry
seeds
uninjured
for
many
miles
and
finally
deposit
them
in
places
where
they
sprout
and
grow
into
trees
many
seeds
are
carried
by
the
ocean
currents
to
distant
foreign
shores
the
decay
of
leaves
and
woodland
vegetation
forms
rich
and
fertile
soils
in
the
forests
in
which
conditions
are
favorable
for
the
development
of
new
tree
growth
when
living
tree
seeds
are
exposed
to
proper
amounts
of
moisture
warmth
and
air
in
a
fertile
soil
they
will
sprout
and
grow
a
root
develops
which
pushes
its
way
down
into
the
soil
while
the
of
the
plant
which
springs
from
the
other
end
of
the
seed
works
its
way
upward
toward
the
light
and
air
this
leafy
part
of
the
seed
finally
forms
the
stem
of
the
tree
but
trees
may
produce
plenty
of
seed
and
yet
fail
to
maintain
their
proper
proportion
in
the
forest
this
results
because
much
of
the
seed
is
unsound
even
where
a
satisfactory
supply
of
sound
fertile
seed
is
produced
it
does
not
follow
that
the
trees
of
that
variety
will
be
maintained
in
the
forest
as
the
seed
supply
may
be
scattered
in
unfavorable
positions
for
germination
millions
of
little
seedlings
however
start
to
grow
in
the
forest
each
year
but
only
a
small
number
survive
and
become
large
trees
this
is
because
so
many
of
the
seedlings
are
destroyed
by
forest
fires
cattle
and
sheep
grazing
unfavorable
soil
and
weather
conditions
and
many
other
causes
beech
and
chestnut
trees
and
others
of
the
type
reproduce
by
means
of
sprouts
as
well
as
by
seed
generally
the
young
stumps
of
trees
produce
more
sprouts
than
the
stumps
of
older
trees
which
have
stood
for
some
time
among
the
trees
reproduction
by
sprouts
is
rare
the
redwood
of
california
is
one
of
the
few
exceptions
the
pitch
pine
of
the
eastern
states
produces
many
sprouts
few
of
which
live
and
develop
into
marketable
timber
when
trees
are
grown
in
nurseries
the
practice
is
to
sow
the
seed
in
special
beds
filled
with
rich
soil
lath
screens
are
used
as
shade
they
protect
the
young
seedlings
from
the
sun
just
as
the
parent
trees
would
do
in
the
forest
the
seedbeds
are
kept
well
cultivated
and
free
of
weeds
so
that
the
seedlings
may
have
the
best
opportunities
for
rapid
growth
generally
the
seeds
are
sown
in
the
spring
between
march
and
may
such
seeds
as
the
elms
and
soft
maples
which
ripen
in
the
early
summer
are
sown
as
soon
as
possible
after
they
are
gathered
practical
tests
have
shown
that
thick
sowings
of
tree
seeds
give
the
best
results
there
is
little
danger
of
weeds
smothering
out
the
seedlings
under
such
conditions
after
the
seed
has
germinated
the
beds
may
be
thinned
so
that
the
seedlings
will
have
more
room
to
develop
during
the
fall
of
the
same
year
or
in
the
following
spring
the
seedlings
should
be
transplanted
to
nursery
rows
thereafter
it
is
customary
to
transplant
the
young
trees
at
least
once
again
during
damp
weather
when
the
trees
finally
are
robust
and
vigorous
and
have
reached
the
age
of
two
to
five
years
they
are
dug
up
carefully
and
set
out
permanently
the
usual
practice
is
to
keep
the
seedlings
one
year
in
the
seedbed
and
two
years
in
the
nursery
rows
before
they
are
set
out
whether
the
transplanting
should
take
place
during
the
spring
or
fall
depends
largely
on
the
climate
and
geography
of
the
locality
practical
experience
is
the
best
guide
in
such
matters
some
farmers
and
land
owners
are
now
interested
in
setting
out
hardwood
forests
for
commercial
purposes
if
they
do
not
wish
to
purchase
their
seedlings
from
a
reliable
they
can
grow
them
from
carefully
selected
seed
planted
in
seedbeds
the
popular
practice
is
to
sow
the
seed
in
drills
about
to
feet
apart
so
that
horses
may
be
used
for
cultivation
the
seeds
are
sown
to
a
depth
of
to
times
their
thickness
they
are
placed
close
enough
in
the
drill
so
that
from
to
seedlings
to
the
linear
foot
result
in
order
to
hasten
the
sprouting
of
the
seeds
some
planters
soak
them
in
cold
water
for
several
days
before
sowing
in
the
case
of
such
seed
as
the
black
locust
or
honey
locust
it
is
best
to
soak
them
in
hot
water
before
planting

families
trees
are
as
queer
in

places
to

frost
means
death
to
most
of
the
trees
that
come
from
near
the
equator
even
on
the
opposite
slopes
of
the
same
mountain
the
types
of
trees
are
often
very
different
trees
that
do
well
on
the
north
side
require
plenty
of
moisture
and
cool
weather
those
that
prosper
on
south
exposures
are
equipped
to
resist
late
and
early
frosts
as
well
as
very
hot
sunshine
the
moisture
needs
of
different
trees
are
as
remarkable
as
their
likes
and
dislikes
for
warmth
and
cold
some
trees
attain
large
size
in
a
swampy
country
trees
of
the
same
kind
will
become
stunted
in
sections
where
dry
weather
persists
in
some
parts
of
the
united
states
forestry
experts
can
tell
where
they
are
by
the
local
tree
growth
for
example
in
the
extreme
northern
districts
the
spruce
and
the
balsam
fir
are
native
as
one
travels
farther
south
these
give
way
to
little
jack
pine
and
aspen
trees
next
come
the
stately
forests
of
white
and
norway
pine
sometimes
a
few
hemlock
trees
appear
in
the
colder
sections
if
one
continues
his
journey
toward
the
equator
he
will
next
pass
through
forests
of
trees
they
will
include
oak
maple
beech
chestnut
hickory
and
sycamore
in
kentucky
which
is
a
centre
of
the
belt
there
are
several
hundred
different
varieties
of
trees
farther
south
the
species
prevail
they
are
followed
in
the
march
toward
the
gulf
of
mexico
by
the
tropical
trees
of
southern
florida
if
one
journeys
west
from
the
mississippi
river
across
the
great
plains
he
finally
will
come
to
the
rocky
mountains
where
evergreen
trees
predominate
if
oak
maple
poplar
or
other
trees
grow
in
that
region
they
occur
in
scattered
stands
in
the
eastern
forests
the
trees
are
close
together
they
form
a
leafy
canopy
overhead
in
the
forests
of
the
rockies
the
evergreens
stand
some
distance
apart
so
that
their
tops
do
not
touch
as
a
result
these
western
forests
do
not
shade
the
ground
as
well
as
those
in
the
east
this
causes
the
soils
of
these
forests
to
be
much
drier
and
also
increases
the
danger
from
fire
the
forests
of
western
washington
and
oregon
unlike
most
timberlands
of
the
rocky
mountain
region
are
as
dense
as
any
forests
in
the
world
even
at
midday
it
is
as
dark
as
twilight
in
these
forests
the
trees
are
gigantic
they
tower
to
feet
above
the
ground
their
trunks
often
are
feet
or
larger
in
diameter
they
make
the
trees
of
the
eastern
forests
look
stunted
they
are
excelled
in
size
only
by
the
mammoth
redwood
trees
of
northern
california
and
the
giant
sequoias
of
the
southern
sierras
illustration
the
sequoias
of

differences
of
climate
have
largely
influenced
tree
growth
and
types
in
this
country
the
distribution
of
tree
families
is
changing
all
the
time
it
shifts
just
as
the
climate
and
other
conditions
change
trees
constantly
strive
among
themselves
for
control
of
different
localities
for
a
time
one
species
will
predominate
then
other
varieties
will
appear
and
displace
the
ones
already
established
the
distribution
of
trees
changes
very
remarkably
from
one
century
to
another
for
example
in
some
sections
the
red
and
black
oaks
are
replacing
the
white
oaks
some
trees
are
they
require
much
more
sunlight
than
others
that
do
well
under
heavy
shade
oak
trees
require
plenty
of
light
maples
or
beeches
thrive
on
little
light
the
seed
of
trees
requiring
little
light
may
be
scattered
in
a
dense
forest
together
with
that
of
trees
which
need
plenty
of
daylight
in
order
to
make
normal
growth
the
seedlings
that
like
shade
will
develop
under
such
conditions
while
those
that
need
light
will
pine
away
and
die
gradually
the
trees
will
replace
the
trees
in
such
a
forest
stand
even
the
different
trees
of
the
same
family
often
strive
with
one
another
for
light
and
moisture
each
tree
differs
from
every
other
one
in
shape
and
size
trees
will
adapt
themselves
to
the
light
and
moisture
conditions
to
which
they
are
exposed
a
tree
that
has
access
to
plenty
of
moisture
and
sunlight
grows
evenly
from
the
ground
to
its
top
with
a
bushy
crown
the
same
tree
if
it
grows
in
the
shade
will
reach
a
greater
height
but
will
have
a
small
compact
crown
trees
run
a
race
in
their
rapidity
of
growth
the
winners
get
the
desirable
places
in
the
sunlight
and
prosper
the
losers
develop
into
stunted
trees
that
often
die
due
to
lack
of
light
exposure
a
better
quality
of
lumber
results
from
tall
straight
trees
than
that
produced
by
the
symmetrical
branching
trees
that
is
why
every
forester
who
sets
out
trees
tries
to
provide
conditions
which
will
make
them
grow
tall
and
with
the
smallest
possible
covering
of
branches
on
the
lower
part
of
the
trunks
where
trees
are
exposed
to
strong
winds
they
develop
deep
and
strong
root
systems
they
produce
large
and
strong
trunks
that
can
bend
and
resist
violent
winds
which
sway
and
twist
them
in
every
direction
such
trees
are
much
stronger
and
sturdier
than
those
that
grow
in
a
sheltered
forest
the
trees
that
are
blown
down
in
the
forest
provide
space
for
the
introduction
and
growth
of
new
varieties
these
activities
are
constantly
changing
the
type
of
tree
growth
in
the
forest
our
original
forests
which
bordered
the
atlantic
coast
line
when
america
was
first
settled
were
dense
and
impenetrable
the
colonists
feared
the
forests
because
they
sheltered
the
hostile
indians
who
lurked
near
the
white
settlements
in
time
this
fear
of
the
forest
developed
into
hatred
of
the
forest
as
a
result
the
colonists
cut
trees
as
rapidly
as
they
could
in
every
way
they
fought
back
the
wilderness
they
and
their
children
have
worked
so
effectively
that
the
original
wealth
of
woodlands
has
been
depleted
at
present
cleared
fields
and
cutover
areas
abound
in
regions
that
at
one
time
were
covered
with
magnificent
stands
of
timber
in
many
sections
of
the
country
our
forests
are
now
so
reduced
that
they
are
of
little
commercial
importance
however
these
areas
are
not
yet
entirely
denuded
predictions
have
been
made
frequently
that
our
woodlands
would
soon
disappear
scientific
foresters
report
that
such
statements
are
incorrect
there
are
only
a
few
districts
in
the
country
which
probably
will
never
again
support
much
tree
growth
their
denuded
condition
is
due
largely
to
the
destruction
of
the
neighboring
mountain
forests
and
to
the
activities
of
erosion
under
ordinary
conditions
natural
reforestation
will
maintain
a
satisfactory
tree
growth
on
lands
where
a
practical
system
of
forest
protection
is
practiced
the
complete
removal
of
the
forest
is
now
accomplished
only
in
fertile
farming
regions
where
the
agricultural
value
of
the
land
is
too
high
to
permit
it
to
remain
longer
in
forest
cover
even
in
the
mississippi
valley
and
the
great
lakes
belts
there
are
still
large
areas
of
forest
land
most
of
the
farms
have
woodlots
which
provide
fuel
fencing
and
some
lumber
for
the
most
part
these
farm
woodlots
are
abused
they
have
not
been
managed
correctly
fortunately
a
change
for
the
better
is
now
evident
the
farm
woodlot
owners
are
coming
to
appreciate
the
importance
of
protecting
the
trees
for
future
use
in
some
cases
they
are
even
replanting
areas
that
have
been
cut
over
there
are
large
tracts
of
sandy
rocky
and
swampy
land
in
these
districts
that
are
satisfactory
for
tree
production
in
fact
about
all
these
fields
are
good
for
is
the
growing
of
timber
campaigns
are
now
under
way
to
increase
tree
planting
and
develop
the
production
of
lands
adapted
for
forestry
which
previously
have
been
idle
the
united
states
of
the
future
will
not
be
a
desert
country
however
immediate
measures
to
save
our
remaining
trees
must
be
developed
the
greater
part
of
our
virgin
timber
has
already
been
felled
the
aftermath
forests
which
succeed
the
virgin
stand
generally
are
inferior
our
supplies
of
ash
black
walnut
and
hickory
once
abundant
are
now
seriously
limited
formerly
these
mixed
forests
covered
vast
stretches
of
country
which
today
support
only
a
scant
crop
of
young
trees
which
will
not
be
ready
for
market
for
many
years
these
stands
will
never
approach
in
value
or
quality
the
original
forests
over
large
areas
poplar
white
birch
and
jack
pine
trees
now
predominate
on
lands
which
formerly
bore
dense
stands
of
white
pine
in
many
places
scrubby
underbrush
and
stunted
trees
occupy
lands
which
heretofore
have
been
heavy
producers
of
marketable
timber
trees
generally
speaking
farm
lands
should
not
be
used
for
forestry
purposes
on
the
other
hand
some
forest
lands
can
be
profitably
cleared
and
used
for
agriculture
for
example
settlers
are
felling
trees
and
fighting
stumps
in
northern
wisconsin
michigan
and
minnesota
some
of
these
virgin
lands
are
valuable
for
farming
purposes
others
are
not
it
is
preferable
that
they
should
produce
farm
crops
instead
of
tree
crops
if
the
land
is
best
adapted
to
agricultural
use
it
is
an
economic
necessity
that
all
lands
in
this
country
best
suited
for
farming
purposes
should
be
tilled
our
population
demands
that
every
acre
of
land
useful
for
growing
crops
should
be
cleared
and
devoted
to
farming
under
such
conditions
the
settlers
should
reserve
sufficient
woodlands
for
their
home
needs
carefully
distinguishing
between
the
land
that
is
best
for
agricultural
purposes
and
the
land
that
is
best
for
forestry
purposes
and
thus
doubling
their
resources
thoughtless
lumbermen
have
pillaged
millions
of
acres
of
our
most
productive
forests
the
early
lumbermen
wasted
our
woodland
resources
they
made
the
same
mistakes
as
everyone
else
in
the
care
and
protection
of
our
original
forests
the
greatest
blame
for
the
wasting
of
our
lumber
resources
rests
with
the
state
and
federal
authorities
who
permitted
the
depletion
many
of
our
lumbermen
now
appreciate
the
need
of
preserving
and
protecting
our
forests
for
future
generations
some
of
them
have
changed
their
policies
and
are
now
doing
all
in
their
power
to
aid
forest
conservation
the
ability
of
a
properly
managed
forest
to
produce
new
crops
of
trees
year
after
year
promises
us
a
future
supply
of
wood
sufficient
for
all
our
needs
if
only
we
will
conserve
our
timberlands
as
they
deserve
it
is
our
duty
to
handle
the
forests
in
the
same
way
that
fertile
farming
fields
are
managed
that
is
to
say
they
should
be
so
treated
that
they
will
yield
a
profitable
money
crop
every
year
without
reducing
their
powers
of
future
production
private
owners
and
farmers
are
coming
slowly
to
realize
the
grave
importance
of
preserving
and
extending
our
woodlands
the
public
the
state
and
the
nation
are
now
solidly
behind
the
movement
to
improve
our
forestry
and
to
our
forests
several
of
the
states
including
new
york
and
pennsylvania
have
purchased
large
areas
of
timberlands
for
state
forests
these
will
be
developed
as
future
sources
of
lumber
supply
chapter
iii
forests
and
floods
forests
are
necessary
at
the
headwaters
of
streams
the
trees
break
the
force
of
the
rain
drops
and
the
forest
floor
acting
as
a
large
sponge
absorbs
rainfall
and
prevents
and
floods
unless
there
are
forests
at
the
sources
of
streams
and
rivers
floods
occur
the
spring
uprisings
of
the
mississippi
ohio
and
missouri
rivers
are
due
largely
to
the
lack
of
forests
at
their
headwaters
in
the
regions
drained
by
these
streams
the
water
is
not
absorbed
as
it
should
be
it
flows
unimpeded
from
the
higher
levels
to
the
river
valleys
it
floods
the
river
courses
with
so
much
water
that
they
burst
their
banks
and
pour
over
the
surrounding
country
many
floods
which
occur
in
the
united
states
occur
because
we
have
cut
down
large
areas
of
trees
which
formerly
protected
the
sources
of
streams
and
rivers
a
grave
danger
that
threatens
western
farming
is
that
some
time
in
the
future
the
greater
part
of
the
vegetation
and
forest
cover
on
the
watersheds
of
that
section
may
entirely
disappear
such
a
condition
would
cause
floods
after
every
heavy
rain
the
available
supplies
of
rainwater
which
are
needed
for
the
thirsty
crops
would
be
wasted
as
flood
waters
these
floods
would
cause
great
damage
in
the
valleys
through
which
they
rushed
the
freshets
would
be
followed
by
periods
of
water
famine
the
streams
would
then
be
so
low
that
they
could
not
supply
the
normal
demands
farmers
would
suffer
on
account
of
the
lack
of
irrigation
water
towns
and
cities
that
depended
on
the
mountain
streams
for
their
water
supplies
would
be
handicapped
severely
in
a
thousand
and
one
ways
a
deficient
water
supply
due
to
forest
depletion
would
cause
hardships
and
suffering
in
the
regions
exposed
to
such
misfortune
the
important
part
which
forests
play
in
the
development
of
our
country
is
shown
by
the
fact
that
from
the
streams
of
the
national
forests
over
western
cities
and
towns
with
an
aggregate
population
of
nearly
obtain
their
domestic
water
supply
the
forests
include
irrigation
projects
and
plants
in
addition
to
many
other
power
and
irrigation
companies
which
depend
on
the
government
timberlands
for
water
conservation
and
the
regulation
of
rain
water
and
stream
flow
the
national
forests
aid
greatly
in
conserving
and
making
available
for
use
the
precious
limited
rainfall
of
the
arid
regions
that
is
why
settlers
in
irrigated
districts
are
deeply
interested
in
the
cutting
of
timber
in
the
federal
woodlands
destructive
lumbering
is
never
practiced
in
these
forests
in
its
place
has
been
substituted
a
system
of
management
that
assures
the
continued
preservation
of
the
uncle
sam
is
paying
special
attention
to
the
western
which
supply
reclamation
and
irrigation
projects
he
understands
that
the
ability
of
the
forest
to
regulate
stream
flow
is
of
great
importance
the
irrigation
farmers
also
desire
a
regular
flow
evenly
distributed
throughout
the
growing
season
one
of
the
chief
reasons
for
the
establishment
of
the
national
forest
was
to
preserve
the
natural
conditions
favorable
to
stream
flow
in
a
treeless
country
the
rise
of
the
streams
is
a
very
accurate
measure
of
the
rainfall
in
the
region
where
forests
are
frequent
an
ordinary
rain
is
scarcely
noticed
in
its
effect
on
the
stream
in
a
denuded
district
no
natural
obstacles
impede
the
raindrops
as
they
patter
to
the
ground
the
surface
of
the
soil
is
usually
hard
it
is
baked
and
dried
out
by
the
sun
it
is
not
in
condition
to
absorb
or
retain
much
of
the
water
consequently
the
rain
water
finds
little
to
stop
it
as
it
swirls
down
the
slopes
in
torrents
it
rushes
down
the
stream
beds
like
sheets
of
water
flowing
down
the
steep
roof
of
a
house
conditions
are
very
different
in
a
region
where
forest
cover
is
abundant
in
the
forests
the
tops
of
the
trees
catch
much
of
the
rain
that
falls
the
leaves
twigs
branches
and
trunks
of
the
trees
also
soak
up
considerable
moisture
the
amount
of
rainfall
that
directly
strikes
the
ground
is
relatively
small
the
upper
layer
of
the
forested
ground
consists
of
a
network
of
shrubs
and
dead
leaves
branches
and
moss
this
forest
carpet
acts
like
an
enormous
sponge
it
soaks
up
the
moisture
which
drops
from
the
trees
during
a
storm
it
can
absorb
and
hold
for
a
time
a
rainfall
of
four
or
five
inches
the
water
that
finally
reaches
the
ground
sinks
into
the
soil
and
is
evaporated
or
runs
off
slowly
the
portion
that
is
absorbed
by
the
soil
is
taken
up
by
the
roots
of
the
trees
and
plants
or
goes
to
supply
springs
and
watercourses
the
power
of
the
trees
and
forest
soil
to
absorb
water
regulates
the
rate
at
which
the
rainfall
is
fed
to
the
streams
and
rivers
frequently
it
takes
weeks
and
even
months
for
all
the
waters
of
a
certain
rain
to
reach
these
streams
this
gradual
supplying
of
water
to
the
streams
regulates
their
flow
it
prevents
floods
and
freshets
careful
observation
and
measurements
have
shown
that
unforested
regions
will
discharge
rain
water
at
least
twice
as
fast
as
will
forested
districts
the
stealing
of
soil
by
erosion
occurs
where
waters
are
not
obstructed
by
forest
growth
silt
sand
and
every
other
kind
of
soil
are
swept
from
their
natural
positions
and
spritted
away
by
the
foaming
waters
as
they
surge
down
the
steep
slopes
the
stream
or
river
which

is
becoming
more
fully

reason
chapter
iv
wild
life
of
the
forest
the
forests
of
our
country
are
the
home
and
breeding
grounds
of
hundreds
of
millions
of
birds
and
game
animals
which
the
forests
provide
with
food
and
shelter
if
we
had
no
forests
many
of
these
birds
and
animals
would
soon
disappear
the
acorns
and
other
nuts
that
the
squirrels
live
upon
are
examples
of
the
food
that
the
forest
provides
for
its
residents
in
the
clear
cold
streams
of
the
forests
there
are
many
different
kinds
of
fish
if
the
forests
were
destroyed
by
cutting
or
fire
many
of
the
brooks
and
rivers
would
either
dry
up
or
the
water
would
become
so
low
that
thousands
of
fish
would
die
the
most
abundant
game
animals
of
forest
regions
are
deer
elk
antelope
and
moose
partridge
grouse
quail
wild
turkeys
and
other
game
birds
are
plentiful
in
some
regions
the
best
known
of
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
woods
are
the
squirrels
the
presence
of
these
many
birds
and
animals
adds
greatly
to
the
attractiveness
of
the
forest
predatory
animals
such
as
wolves
bears
mountain
lions
coyotes
and
bobcats
also
live
in
the
forest
they
kill
much
livestock
each
year
in
the
mountain
regions
of
the
western
states
and
they
also
prey
on
some
species
of
bird
life
the
federal
and
some
state
governments
now
employ
professional
hunters
to
trap
and
shoot
these
marauders
each
year
the
hunters
kill
thousands
of
predatory
animals
thus
saving
the
farmers
and
cattle
and
sheep
owners
many
thousands
of
dollars
sportsmen
are
so
numerous
and
hunting
is
so
popular
that
game
refuges
have
to
be
provided
in
the
forests
and
parks
were
it
not
for
these
havens
of
refuge
where
hunting
is
not
permitted
some
of
our
best
known
wild
game
and
birds
would
soon
be
extinct
there
are
more
than
acres
of
forest
land
in
the
government
game
refuges
california
has
game
refuges
in
her
national
forests
new
mexico
has
while
montana
idaho
colorado
washington
and
oregon
also
have
set
aside
areas
of
government
forest
land
for
that
purpose
in
establishing
a
game
refuge
it
is
necessary
to
pick
out
a
large
area
of
land
that
contains
enough
good
feed
for
both
the
summer
and
winter
use
of
the
animals
that
will
inhabit
it
illustration
a
forest
ranger
and
his
forest
cabin
livestock
is
sometimes
grazed
on
game
refuges
but
only
in
small
numbers
so
that
plenty
of
grass
will
be
left
for
the
support
of
the
wild
game
the
refuges
are
under
the
direction
of
the
federal
and
the
state
game
departments
to
perpetuate
game
animals
and
game
birds
it
is
not
enough
to
pass
game
laws
and
forbid
the
shooting
of
certain
animals
and
birds
except
at
special
times
of
the
year
it
is
also
necessary
to
provide
good
breeding
grounds
for
the
birds
and
animals
where
they
will
not
be
molested
or
killed
the
game
refuges
provide
such
conditions
the
division
of
the
range
country
into
small
farms
and
the
raising
of
all
kinds
of
crops
have
it
is
claimed
done
more
to
decrease
our
herds
of
antelope
elk
deer
and
other
big
game
than
have
the
rifles
of
the
hunters
the
plow
and
harrow
have
driven
the
wild
life
back
into
the
rougher
country
the
snow
becomes
very
deep
in
the
mountains
in
the
winter
and
the
wild
animals
could
not
get
food
were
it
not
for
the
game
refuges
in
the
low
country
in
the
yellowstone
national
park
country
great
bands
of
elk
come
down
from
the
mountains
during
severe
winters
and
have
to
be
fed
on
hay
to
keep
them
from
starving
as
there
is
not
sufficient
winter
range
in
this
region
to
supply
food
for
the
thousands
of
elk
where
the
elk
are
protected
from
hunters
they
increase
rapidly
this
means
that
some
of
the
surplus
animals
have
to
be
killed
otherwise
the
elk
would
soon
be
so
numerous
that
they
would
seriously
interfere
with
the
grazing
of
domestic
livestock
in
different
sections
of
the
elk
country
a
count
is
made
every
few
years
on
the
breeding
animals
in
each
band
whenever
a
surplus
accumulates
the
state
permits
hunters
to
shoot
some
of
the
elk
if
the
breeding
herds
get
too
small
no
hunting
is
allowed
in
this
way
a
proper
balance
is
maintained
in
many
states
the
wild
game
birds
and
animals
of
the
forests
are
protected
by
closed
seasons
during
which
hunting
is
not
permitted
it
is
realized
that
birds
and
animals
are
not
only
of
interest
to
visitors
to
the
forests
but
that
they
as
well
as
the
trees
are
a
valuable
forest
product
chapter
v
important
forest
trees
and
their
uses
of
our
native
trees
the
white
pine
is
one
of
the
best
and
most
valuable
it
is
a
tall
straight
tree
that
grows
to
a
height
of
to
feet
it
produces
wood
that
is
light
in
weight
and
easy
to
work
because
it
is
so
soft
at
one
time
there
were
extensive
pine
forests
in
the
northeastern
states
many
of
the
trees
were
very
large
and
occasionally
one
may
still
see
pine
stumps
that
are
to
feet
in
diameter
white
pine
made
fine
lumber
for
houses
and
other
buildings
and
this
timber
was
among
the
first
to
be
exhausted
in
the
country
spruce
trees
have
long
furnished
the
bulk
of
the
woodpulp
used
in
making
our
supplies
of
paper
these
trees
live
in
the
colder
climates
of
the
northern
states
they
like
to
grow
in
low
wet
localities
close
to
lakes
or
rivers
the
spruces
generally
do
not
grow
higher
than
feet
the
wood
is
soft
like
pine
and
even
whiter
in
color
the
aboriginal
indians
used
the
roots
of
the
spruce
trees
as
thread
twine
and
rope
the
cedar
trees
which
are
landmarks
in
many
of
our
northern
states
yield
light
soft
durable
wood
that
is
useful
in
making
poles
fence
posts
lead
pencils
and
cedar
chests
the
wood
of
the
red
cedar
gives
off
a
peculiar
odor
which
is
said
to
keep
moths
away
from
clothes
stored
in
cedar
chests
but
it
is
the
close
construction
of
the
chest
which
keeps
them
out
these
trees
are
becoming
scarce
in
all
parts
of
the
country
cedars
generally
are
small
trees
that
grow
slowly
and
live
a
long
time
the
outside
wood
is
white
and
the
heartwood
is
red
or
yellow
cedar
posts
last
a
long
time
and
are
excellent
for
use
in
farm
fences
chestnut
blight
which
destroys
entire
forests
of
chestnut
timber
is
gradually
exhausting
our
supplies
of
this
wood
chestnut
timber
has
long
been
used
for
railroad
ties
fence
posts
and
in
the
manufacture
of
cheap
furniture
the
wood
is
soft
and
brown
in
color
the
bark
and
wood
are
treated
at
special
plants
in
such
a
way
that
an
extract
which
is
valuable
for
tanning
leather
is
obtained
chestnut
trees
are
upstanding
straight
trees
that
tower
to
feet
above
the
ground
the
extinction
of
our
chestnut
forests
threatens
as
no
effectual
control
measures
for
checking
the
chestnut
blight
disease
over
large
areas
has
yet
been
discovered
the
yellow
poplar
or
tulip
poplar
furnishes
timber
for
the
manufacture
of
furniture
paper
the
interior
of
railroad
cars
and
automobiles
the
dugouts
of
the
early
settlers
and
indians
were
hewed
out
of
poplar
logs
these
boats
were
stronger
than
those
made
of
canoe
birch
poplar
wood
is
yellow
in
color
and
soft
in
texture
the
poplar
is
the
largest
tree
in
this
country
and
the
trees
are
of
great
size
and
height
some
specimens
found
in
the
mountains
of
the
south
have
been
over
feet
high
and
to
feet
in
diameter
while
poplars
to
feet
high
are
quite
common
among
our
most
useful
and
valuable
trees
are
the
white
oak
and
its
close
kin
the
red
oak
which
produce
a
hard
wood
of
remarkable
durability
the
white
oak
is
the
monarch
of
the
forest
as
it
lives
very
long
and
is
larger
and
stronger
than
the
majority
of
its
associates
the
timber
is
used
for
railroad
ties
furniture
and
in
general
construction
work
where
tough
durable
lumber
is
needed
many
of
our
wooden
ships
have
been
built
of
oak
the
white
oaks
often
grow
as
high
as
feet
and
attain
massive
dimensions
the
seeds
of
the
white
oaks
are
light
brown
acorns
which
are
highly
relished
by
birds
and
animals
many
southern
farmers
range
their
hogs
in
white
oak
forests
so
that
the
porkers
can
live
on
the
acorn
crop
beech
wood
is
strong
and
tough
and
is
used
in
making
boxes
and
barrels
and
casks
for
the
shipment
of
butter
sugar
and
other
foods
it
makes
axles
and
shafts
for
that
will
last
for
many
years
the
shoes
worn
by
dutch
children
are
generally
made
of
beech
the
wood
is
red
in
color
the
beech
tree
is
of
medium
size
growing
to
a
height
of
about
feet
above
the
ground
there
is
only
one
common
variety
of
beech
tree
in
this
country
hickory
trees
are
very
popular
because
they
produce
sweet
edible
nuts
the
hickory
wood
is
exceedingly
strong
and
tough
and
is
used
wherever
stout
material
is
needed
for
the
spokes
wheels
and
bodies
of
buggies
and
wagons
for
agricultural
implements
for
automobile
wheels
and
for
handles
hickory
is
unexcelled
the
shafts
of
golf
clubs
as
well
as
some
types
of
bats
are
made
of
hickory
most
hickory
trees
are
easy
to
identify
on
account
of
their
shaggy
bark
the
nuts
of
the
hickory
which
ripen
in
the
autumn
are
sweet
delicious
and
much
in
demand
our
native
elm
tree
is
stately
reaching
a
height
of
feet
and
a
diameter
of
to
feet
or
more
it
is
one
of
our
best
shade
trees
elm
wood
is
light
brown
in
color
and
very
heavy
and
strong
it
is
the
best
available
wood
for
making
wagon
wheel
hubs
and
is
also
used
largely
for
baskets
and
barrels
the
rims
of
bicycle
wheels
generally
are
made
of
elm
the
canoe
birch
is
a
tree
which
was
treasured
by
the
early
indians
because
it
yielded
bark
for
making
canoes
birch
wood
is
used
in
making
shoe
lasts
and
pegs
because
of
its
strength
and
light
weight
and
the
millions
of
spools
on
which
cotton
is
wound
are
made
of
birch
wood
school
desks
and
church
furniture
also
are
made
of
birch
the
inner
bark
of
the
birch
tree
is
so
fine
and
delicate
that
the
early
settlers
could
use
it
as
they
would
paper
no
matter
whether
birch
wood
is
green
or
dry
it
will
burn
readily
the
birch
was
the
most
useful
tree
of
the
forest
to
the
indians
its
bark
was
used
not
only
for
making
their
canoes
but
also
for
building
their
wigwams
they
even
dried
and
ground
the
inner
bark
into
a
flour
which
they
used
as
a
food
the
northern
sugar
maple
is
another
tree
which
is
a
favorite
in
all
sections
where
it
is
grown
this
tree
yields
a
hard
wood
that
is
the
best
and
toughest
timber
grown
in
some
localities
the
trees
grow
to
heights
of
to
feet
and
attain
girths
of
to
feet
maple
lumber
is
stout
and
heavy
it
makes
fine
flooring
and
is
used
in
skating
rinks
and
for
bowling
alleys
many
pianos
are
made
of
maple
wooden
dishes
and
rolling
pins
are
usually
made
from
maple
wood
during
the
spring
of
the
year
when
the
sap
is
flowing
the
average
mature
maple
tree
will
yield
from
fifteen
to
twenty
gallons
of
sap
in
a
period
of
three
to
four
weeks
this
sap
is
afterwards
boiled
down
to
maple
syrup
and
sugar
hemlock
trees
despite
the
fact
that
they
rank
among
the
most
beautiful
trees
of
the
forest
produce
lumber
which
is
suitable
only
for
rough
building
operations
the
wood
is
brown
and
soft
and
will
not
last
long
when
exposed
to
the
weather
it
cracks
and
splits
easily
because
it
is
so
brittle
hemlock
is
now
of
considerable
importance
as
pulpwood
for
making
paper
for
many
years
a
material
important
for
tanning
leather
has
been
extracted
in
large
amounts
from
the
bark
of
hemlock
trees
one
of
the
most
pleasing
uses
to
which
the
balsam
fir
is
put
is
as
christmas
trees
sometimes
it
is
used
in
making
paper
pulp
the
balsam
fir
seldom
grows
higher
than
feet
or
thicker
than
inches
the
leaves
of
this
tree
have
a
very
sweet
odor
and
are
in
demand
at
christmas
time
foresters
and
woodsmen
often
use
balsam
boughs
to
make
their
beds
and
pillows
when

in
the

industries
on
the
average
each
american
farmer
uses
about
board
feet
of
lumber
each
year
new
farm
building
decreased
in
the
several
years
following
the
world
war
due
to
the
high
price
of
lumber
and
labor
as
a
result
of
this
lack
of
necessary
building
millions
of
dollars
worth
of
farm
machinery
stood

was
done
in
that
period
in

consume
about
per

now
douglas
fir
southern
pine
and
other
woods
are
being
used
largely
throughout
the
middle
western
and
eastern
states
the
supply
of
white
oak
ties
is
small
and
the
prices
are
high
some
years
ago
when
white
oak
was
abundant
the
railroads
that
now
are
using
other
would
not
have
even
considered
such
material
for
use
in
their
roadbeds
the
fact
that
other
ties
are
now
being
used
emphasizes
the
fact
that
we
are
short
on
oak
timber
in
the
sections
where
this
hardwood
formerly
was
common
the
furniture
industry
uses
hardwoods
of
superior
grade
and
quality
the
factories
of
this
industry
have
moved
from
region
to
region
as
the
supply
of
hardwoods
became
depleted
originally
these
factories
were
located
in
the
northeastern
states
then
as
the
supplies
of
hardwood
timber
in
those
sections
gave
out
they
moved
westward
they
remained
near
the
corn
belt
until
the
virgin
hardwood
forests
of
the
middle
west
were
practically
exhausted
the
furniture
industry
is
now
largely
dependent
on
what
hardwoods
are
left
in
the
remote
sections
of
the
southern
appalachians
and
the
lower
mississippi
valley
when
these
limited
supplies
are
used
up
there
will
be
very
little
more

in
the

for
them
to
use
the
furniture
veneer
handle
vehicle
automobile
and
agricultural

industries
all
are
in
competition
for

the
furniture

uses
feet
of

lumber
annually
production
of
timber
of
this
type
for
furniture
has
decreased
as
much
as
per

during
the
past
few
years
it
is
now
difficult
for
the
furniture
factories
and
veneer
plants
to
secure
enough
raw
materials
facilities
for
drying
the
green
lumber
artificially
are
few
it
used

the

some
of

prepared
for
the

by
buying
tracts
of

timber
when
these

over
these

will
be
in
the

position
as
the
rest
of

ash

also
by

implement
industries
they
also
use
considerable
oak

with

most
of

are
located

chiefly
from

many
substitutes
for
ash
oak

but
they
have
failed
to
prove
satisfactory
on

expensive
but
it
can
always
be
secured
in
quantity
when
needed
furthermore
it
is
durable
and
very
strong
thus
we
see
that
our
resources

years
a
destructive
forest
fire
in
minnesota
caused
a
loss
of

of
timber
and
property
there
are
several
different
kinds
of
forest
fires
some
burn
unseen
two
to
four
feet
beneath
the
surface
of
the
ground
where
the
soil
contains
much
peat
these
fires
may
persist
for
weeks
or
even
months
sometimes
they
do
not
give
off
any
noticeable
smoke
their
fuel
is
the
decaying
wood
tree
roots
and
similar
material
in
the
soil
these
underground
fires
can
be
stopped
only
by
flooding
the
area
or
by
digging
trenches
down
to
the
mineral
soil
the
most
effectual
way
to
fight
light
surface
fires
is
to
throw
sand
or
earth
on
the
flames
where
the
fire
has
not
made
much
headway
the
flames
can
sometimes
be
beaten
out
with
green
branches
wet
gunny
sacks
or
blankets
the
leaves
and
debris
may
be
raked
away
in
a
path
so
as
to
impede
their
advance
usually
in
the
hardwood
forests
there
is
not
much
cover
such
as
dry
leaves
on
the
ground
fires
in
these
forests
destroy
the
seedlings
and
saplings
but
do
not
usually
kill
the
mature
trees
however
they
damage
the
base
of
the
trees
and
make
it
easy
for
fungi
and
insects
to
enter
they
also
burn
the
top
soil
and
reduce
the
powers
of
the
forest
floor
in
thick
dense
evergreen
forests
where
the
carpet
is
heavy
fires
are
much
more
serious
they
frequently
kill
the
standing
trees
burning
trunks
and
branches
and
even
following
the
roots
deep
into
the
ground
dead
standing
trees
and
logs

fires
of
this
kind
the
wind
sweeps
pieces
of
burning
bark
or
rotten
wood
great
distances
to
kindle
new
fires
when
they
fall
dead
trees
scatter
sparks
and
embers
over
a
wide
belt
fires
also
run
along
the
tops
of
the
coniferous
trees
high
above
the
ground
these
are
called
and
are
very
difficult
to
control
the
wind
plays
a
big
part
in
the
intensity
of
a
forest
fire
if
the
fire
can
be
turned
so
that
it
will
run
into
the
wind
it
can
be
put
out
more
easily
fires
that
have
the
wind
back
of
them
and
plenty
of
dry
fuel
ahead
speed
on
their
way
of
destruction
at
a
velocity
of
to
miles
an
hour
or
more
they
usually
destroy
everything
in
their
course
that
will
burn
and
waste
great
amounts
of
valuable
timber
wild
animals
in
panic
run
together
before

flames
settlers
and
farmers
with
their

are
overtaken
in
the
mad
flight
and
perish
the
fierce
fires
of
this
type
can
be
stopped
only
by
heavy
rain
a
change
of
wind
or
by
barriers
which
provide
no
fuel
and
thus
choke
out

directed
as
to
run
against

wind
and
toward

the
two
fires
meet
both
will

out
on
account
of

when

by
experienced
persons

very
effectual
in
inexperienced
hands
they
are
dangerous
as
the
wind
may
change
suddenly
or
they
may
be
lighted
too
soon
in
such
cases
they
often
become
as
great
a
menace
as
the
main
fire
another
practical
system
of
fighting
fires
is
to
make
fire
lines
around
the
burning
area
these
fire
lines
or
lanes
as
they
are
sometimes
called
are
stretches
of
land
from
which
all
trees
and
shrubs
have
been
removed
in
the
centre
of
the
lines
a
narrow
trench
is
dug
to
mineral
soil
or
the
lines
are
plowed
or
burned
over
so
that
they
are
bare
of
fuel
such
lines
also
are
of
value
around
woods
and
grain
fields
to
keep
the
fire
out
they
are
commonly
used
along
railroad
tracks
where
locomotive
sparks
are
a
constant
source
of
fire
dangers
our
forests
on
account
of
their
great
size
and
the
relatively
small
man
force
which
guards
them
are
more
exposed
to
fire
dangers
than
any
other
woodlands
in
the
world
the
scant
rainfall
of
many
of
the
western
states
where
great
unbroken
areas
of
forest
are
located
increases
the
fire
damages
the
fact
that
the
western
country
in
many
sections
is
sparsely
settled
favors
destruction
by
forest
fires
the
prevalence
of
lightning
in
the
mountains
during
the
summer
adds
farther
to
the
danger
one
of
the
most
important
tasks
of
the
rangers
in
the
federal
forests
is
to
prevent
forest
fires
during
the
fire
season
extra
forest
guards
are
kept
busy
hunting
for
signs
of
smoke
throughout
the
forests
the
lookouts
in
their
high
towers
which
overlook
large
areas
of
forest
watch
constantly
for
smoke
and
as
soon
as
they
locate
signs
of
fire
they
notify
the
supervisor
of
the
forest
lookouts
use
special
scientific
instruments
which
enable
them
to
locate
the
position
of
the
fires
from
the
smoke
at
the
supervisor
headquarters
and
the
ranger
stations
scattered
through
the

equipment
horses
and
automobiles
are
kept
ready
for
instant
use

a
fire
is

show
how
efficient

the
remaining
or
per

are
classed
as

which
are
set
by
campers
smokers
railroads
brush
burners
sawmills
and
incendiaries
the
total
annual
loss
from
forest
fires
in
the
federal

varies
from
a
few
hundred
thousands
of
dollars
in
favorable
years

this
scattered
work
of

different

some

by
these

there
are
more
than
five
hundred
insects
that
attack
oak
trees
and
at
least
two
hundred
and
fifty
different
species
that
carry
on
destruction
among
the
pines
insect
pests
have
worked
so
actively
that
many
forests
have
lost
practically
all
their
best
trees
of
certain
species
quantities
of
the
largest
spruce
trees
in
the
adirondacks
have
been
killed
off
by
bark
beetles
the
worm
has
killed
off
most
of
the
mature
larches
in
these
eastern
forests
as
they
travel
over
the
national
and
state
forests
the
rangers
are
always
on
the
watch
for
signs
of
tree
infection
whenever
they
notice
masses
of
pitch
and
sawdust
on
the
bark
of
the
trees
they
know
that
insects
are
busy
there
where
the
needles
of
a
pine
or
spruce
turn
yellow
or
red
the
presence
of
bark
beetles
is
shown
signs
of
pitch
on
the
bark
of
coniferous
trees
are
the
first
symptoms
of
infection
these
beetles
bore
through
the
bark
and
into
the
wood
there
they
lay
eggs
the
parent
beetles
soon
die
but
their
children
continue
the
work
of
burrowing
in
the
wood
finally
they
kill
the
tree
by
making
a
complete
cut
around
the
trunk
through
the
layers
of
wood
that
act
as
waiters
to
carry
the
food
from
the
roots
to
the
trunk
branches
and
leaves
the
next
spring
these
young
develop
into
beetles
and
come
out
from
the
diseased
tree
they
then
attack
new
trees
when
the
forest
rangers
find
evidences
of
serious
infection
they
cut
down
the
diseased
trees
they
strip
the
bark
from
the
trunk
and
branches
and
burn
it
in
the
fall
or
winter
when
the
beetles
are
working
in
the
bark
and
can
be
destroyed
most
easily
if
the
infection
of
trees
extends
over
a
large
tract
and
there
is
a
nearby
market
for
the
lumber
the
timber
is
sold
as
soon
as
possible
trap
trees
are
also
used
in
controlling
certain
species
of
injurious
forest
insects
certain
trees
are
girdled
with
an
ax
so
that
they
will
become
weakened
or
die
and
thus
provide
easy
means
of
entrance
for
the
insects
the
beetles
swarm
to
such
trees
in
great
numbers
when
the
tree
is
full
of
insects
it
is
cut
down
and
burned
in
this
way
infections
which
are
not
too
severe
can
often
be
remedied
the
beetles
are
the
most
destructive
insects
that
attack
our
forests
they
have
wasted
enormous
tracts
of
pine

most

can
gain

infection
usually
occurs
through
wounds
in
the
tree
trunk
or
branches
caused
by
lightning
fire
or
by
men
or
animals
the
trees
give
off
pitch
to
cover
such
wounds
in
this
way
they
protect
the
injuries
against
disease
infection
the
hardwood
trees
are
unable
to
protect
their

as
effectively
as
the

where
the

if
all

are
kept
away
from

some
tree
diseases
have
become
established
so
strongly
in
forest
regions
that
it
is
almost
impossible
to
drive
them
out
for
example
chestnut

are
a

can
do
is
to

the

however
it
is
only
occasionally
that
they

some
very
destructive

chapter

the
growth
of
the
forestry
idea
our
forests
of
the
new
world
were
so
abundant
when
the
early
settlers
landed
on
the
atlantic
coast
that
it
was
almost
impossible
to
find
enough
cleared
land
in
one
tract
to
make
a
farm
these
thick
dense
timberlands
extended
westward
to
the
prairie
country
it
was
but
natural
therefore
that
the
forest
should
be
considered
by
these
pioneers
as
an
obstacle
and
viewed
as
an
enemy
farms
and
settlements
had
to
be
hewed
out
of
the
timberlands
and
the
forests
seemed
inexhaustible
experts
say
that
the
original
virgin
forests
of
the
united
states
covered
approximately
acres
they
are
now
shrunk
to
of
that
area
at
one
time
they
were
the
richest
forests
in
the
world
today
there
are
millions
of
acres
which
contain
neither
timber
nor
young
growth
considerable
can
be
restored
if
the
essential
measures
are
started
on
a
national
scale
such
measures
would
insure
an
adequate
lumber
supply
for
all
time
to
come
rules
and
regulations
concerning
the
cutting
of
lumber
and
the
misuse
of
forests
were
suggested
as
early
as
the
seventeenth
century
plymouth
colony
in
passed
an
ordinance
prohibiting
the
cutting
of
timber
from
the
colony
lands
without
official
consent
this
is
said
to
be
the
first
conservation
law
passed
in
america
william
penn
was
one
of
the
early
champions
of
the
woodman
spare
that
tree
slogan
he
ordered
his
colonists
to
leave
one
acre
of
forest
for
every
five
acres
of
land
that
were
cleared
in
congress
set
aside
for
the
purchase
of
a
small
forest
reserve
to
be
used
as
a
supply
source
of
ship
timbers
for
the
navy
about
years
later
it
gave
the
president
the
power
to
call
upon
the
army
and
navy
whenever
necessary
to
protect
the
live
oak
and
red
cedar
timber
so
selected
in
florida
in
the
government
started
its
first
work
in
forestry
it
was
an
attempt
to
raise
live
oak
in
the
southern
states
to
provide
ship
timbers
for
the
navy
forty
years
later
the
wisconsin
state
legislature
began
to
investigate
the
destruction
of
the
forests
of
that
state
in
order
to
protect
them
and
prolong
their
life
michigan
and
maine
in
turn
followed
suit
these
were
some
of
the
first
steps
taken
to
study
our
forests
and
protect
them
against
possible
extinction
the
purpose
of
the
timber
culture
act
passed
by
congress
in
was
to
increase
national
interest
in
reforestation
it
provided
that
every
settler
who
would
plant
and
maintain
acres
of
timber
in
the
treeless
sections
should
be
entitled
to
secure
patent
for
acres
of
the
public
domain
that
vast
territory
consisting
of
all
the
states
and
territories
west
of
the
mississippi
except
texas
as
well
as
ohio
indiana
illinois
michigan
wisconsin
florida
alabama
and
mississippi
this
act
as
well
as
several
state
laws
failed
because
the
settlers
did
not
know
enough
about
tree
planting
the
laws
also
were
not
effective
because
they
did
not
prevent
dishonest
practices
in
the
first
special
agent
in
forestry
was
appointed
by
the
commissioner
of
agriculture
to
study
the
annual
consumption
exportation
and
importation
of
timber
and
other
forest
products
the
probable
supply
for
future
wants
and
the
means
best
adapted
for
forest
preservation
five
years
later
the
division
of
forestry
was
organized
as
a
branch
of
the
department
of
agriculture
it
was
established
in
order
to
carry
on
investigations
about
forestry
and
how
to
preserve

it
distributed
technical
facts

figures
about
the
management
of
private
woodlands
and
collected

concerning

it
did
not

the
yellowstone

by
special
proclamation
of

harrison
later
it
became
part
of
the

although
the
division
of

had
no
special
powers
to
oversee
and
direct
the
management
of
the
forest
reserves
during
the
next
six
years
a
total
of
acres

timberland
were
so
designated
and
set
aside
at
the
request
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior
the
national
academy
of
sciences
therefore
worked
out
a
basis
for
laws
governing
national

congress
enacted
this
law
in
thereafter
the
department
of
the
interior
had
active
charge
of
the
timberlands
at
that
time
little
was
known
scientifically
about
the
american
forests
there
were
no
schools
of

in
this
country
during
the
period
several
such
schools
were
established
president
mckinley
during
his
term
of
office
increased
the
number
of
forest

from

president
roosevelt
added
many
millions
of
acres
to
the

reserves
bringing
the
net
total
to
more
than
acres
including

in
the
administration

was
transferred
from

the
national
forests
are
for
the
most
part
located
in
the
mountainous
region
of
the
west
with
small
scattered
areas
in
the
lake
states
and
the
white
mountains
southern
appalachians
and
ozarks
of
the
eastern
and
southern

many
of
them
are
a
wilderness
of
dense
timber
it
is
a
huge
task
to
protect
these
forests
against
the
ravages
of
fire
fire
fighting
takes
precedence
over
all
other
work
in
the

on
some
of

forests
where
there
are
large

to
enable
the
fire
fighters
and
forest
guardians
to
cover
their
beats
quickly
every
year
the
national
forests
are
being
improved
and
made
more
accessible
by
the
building
of
permanent
roads
trails
and
telephone
lines
special
trails
are
built
to
and
in
the
fire
protection
areas
of
remote
sections
a
network
of
good
roads
is
constructed
in
every
forest
to
improve
fire
fighting
activities
as
well
as
to
afford
better
means
of
communication
between
towns
settlements
and
farms
the
road
and
trail
plan
followed
in
the
national
forests
is
mapped
out
years
in
advance
in
the
more
remote
sections
trails
are
first
constructed
later
these
trails
may
be
developed
into
wagon
or
motor
roads
congress
annually
appropriates
large
sums
of
money
for
the
building
of
roads
in
the
national
forests
over
miles
of
roads
and
miles
of
trails
have
already
been
constructed
in
these
forests
communication
throughout
the
national

is
had
by
the
use
of
the
telephone
and
the
radio
or
wireless
telephone
signalling
by
means
of
the
heliograph
is
practiced
on
bright
days
in

that
have
no

arrangements
made
with
private
telephone
companies
permit
the
forest
officers
to
use
their

the
efficient
communication
systems
aid
in
the
administration
of
the
forests
and
speeds
the
work
of
gathering
fire
fighters
quickly
at
the
points
where
smoke
is
detected
agricultural
and
forestry
experts
have
surveyed
the
lands
in
the
national
forests
thus
they
have
prevented
the
use
of
lands
for
forestry
purposes
which
are
better
adapted
for
farming
since
more
than
acres
of
lands
have
been
excluded
from
the
forests
these
lands
were
more
useful
for
farming
or
grazing
than
for
forestry
practically
all
lands
within
the
national
forests
have
now
been
examined
and
classified
at
intervals
congress
has
combined
several
areas
of
forest
lands
into
single
tracts
government
lands
outside
the
national
forests
have
also
been
traded
for
state
or
private
lands
within
their
boundaries
thus
the
forests
have
been
in
more
compact
bodies
careful
surveys
are
made
before
such
trades
are
closed
to
make
sure
that
the
land
given
to
uncle
sam
is
valuable
for
timber
production
and
the
protection
of
stream
flow
and
that
the
government
receives
full
value
for
the
land
that
is
exchanged
the
national
forests
contain
nearly
five
hundred
billion
board
feet
of
merchantable
timber
this
is
per
cent
of
the
remaining
timber
in
the
country
whenever
the
trees
in
the
forest
reach
maturity
they
are
sold
and
put
to
use
all
green
trees
to
be
cut
are
selected
by
qualified
forest
officers
and
blazed
and
marked
with
a
this
marking
is
done
carefully
so
as
to
protect
the
forest
and
insure
a
future
crop
of
trees
on
the
area
timber
is
furnished
at
low
rates
to
local
farmers
settlers
and
stockmen
for
use
in
making
improvements
much
fire
wood
and
dead
and
down
timber
also
is
given
away
the
removal
of
such
material
lessens
the
fire
danger
in
the
forest
over
a
billion
feet
of
timber
valued
at
more
than
is
sold
annually
from
the
national
forests
one
generally
does
not
think
of
meat
leather
and
wool
as
forest
crops
nevertheless
the
national
forests
play
an
important
part
in
the
western
livestock
industry
experts
report
that
over
of
the
cattle
and
of
the
sheep
of
the
western
states
are
grazed
in
the
national
forests
these
livestock
are
estimated
to
be
worth
nearly
billion
dollars
more
than
head
of
livestock
are
pastured
annually
under
permit
in
the
federal
forests
in
addition
some
to
calves
and
lambs
are
grazed
free
of
charge

beds
in
a

nursery
the
ranges
suitable
for
stock
grazing
are
used
to
pasture
sheep
cattle
horses
hogs
and
goats
the
secretary
of
agriculture
decides
what
number
and
what
kind
of
animals
shall
graze
on
each
forest
he
regulates
the
grazing
and
prevents
injury
to
the
ranges
from
being
overstocked
with
too
many
cattle
and
sheep
the
forest
ranges
are
divided
into
grazing
units
generally
the
cattle
and
horses
are
grazed
in
the
valleys
and
on
the
lower
slopes
of
the
mountain
the
sheep
and
goats
are
pastured
on
the
high
mountain
sides
and
in
the
grassy
meadows
at
or
above
timberline
preferences
to
graze
live
stock
on
the
forest
ranges
are
for
the
most
part
granted
to
stockmen
who
own
improved
ranch
property
and
live
in
or
near
one
of
the
national
forests
the
fee
for
grazing
on
forest
ranges
is
based
on
a
yearlong
rate
of
a
head
of
cattle
for
horses
for
hogs
and
a
head
for
sheep
at
times
it
is
necessary
for
short
periods
to
prohibit
grazing
on
the
government
forest
ranges
for
example
when
mature
timber
has
been
cut
from
certain
areas
it
is
essential
that
sheep
be
kept
off
such
tracts
until
the
young
growth
has
made
a
good
start
in
natural
reforestation
camping
grounds

purposes
by
the
public
are
excluded
from
the

if
a
shortage
of
the
water
supply
of
a
neighboring
town
or
city
threatens
or
if
floods
or
erosion
become
serious
due
to
fire
or
overgrazing
of
the
land
the
range
is
closed
to
and
allowed
to
recuperate
where
artificial
planting
is
practiced
grazing
is
often
forbidden
until
the
young
trees
get
a
good
start
the
total
receipts
which
uncle
sam
collects
from
the
or
more
stockmen
who
graze
their
cattle
and
sheep
on
the
national
forests
amount
to
nearly
annually
as
a
result
of
the
teachings
of
the
forest
service
the
stockmen
are
now
raising
better
livestock
improved
breeding
animals
are
kept
in
the
herds
and
flocks
many
of
the
fat
stock
now
go
directly
from
the
range
to
the
market
formerly
most
of
the
animals
had
to
be
fed
on
corn
and
grain
in
some
of
the
middle
western
states
to
flesh
them
for
market
experiments
have
been
carried
on
which
have
shown
the
advantages
of
new
feeding
and
herding
methods
the
ranchers
have
banded
together
in
livestock
associations
which
co√∂perate
with
the
forest
service
in
managing
the
forest
ranges
it
costs
about
to
sow
one
acre
of
ground
to
tree
seed
and
approximately
an
acre
to
set
out
seedling
trees
the
seed
is
obtained
from
the
same
locality
where
it
is
to
be
planted
in
many
instances
cones
are
purchased
from
settlers
who
make
a
business
of
gathering
them
the
federal
foresters
dry
these
cones
in
the
sun
and
thresh
out
the
seed
which
they
then
fan
and
clean
if
it
is
desired
to
store
supplies
of
tree
seed
from
year
to
year
it
is
kept
in
sacks
or
jars
in
a
cool
dry
place
protected
from
rats
and
mice
where
seed
is
sown
directly
on
the
ground
poison
bait
must
be
scattered
over
the
area
in
order
to
destroy
the
gophers
mice
and
chipmunks
which
otherwise
would
eat
the
seed
sowing
seed
broadcast
on
unprepared
land
has
usually
failed
unless
the
soil
and
weather
conditions
were
just
right
for
the
most
part
setting
out
nursery
seedlings
has
given
better
results
than
direct
seeding
two
men
can
set
out
between
five
hundred
and
one
thousand
trees
a
day
the
national
forests
contain
about
one
million
acres
of
denuded
forest
lands
much
of
this
was
and
so
severely
burned
before
the
creation
of
the
forests
that
it
bears
no
tree
growth
some
of
these
lands
will
reseed
themselves
naturally
while
other
areas
have
to
be
seeded
or
planted
by
hand
in
this
way
the
lands
that
will
produce
profitable
trees
are
fitted
to
support
forest
cover
because
the
soils
and
climate
of
our
national
forests
are
different
special
experiments
have
been
carried
on
in
different
places
to
decide
the
best
practices
to
follow
two
method
of
reforestation
are
commonly
practiced
in
some
places
the
tree
seed
is
sown
directly
upon
the
ground
and
thereafter
may
or
may
not
be
cultivated
this
method
is
limited
to
the
localities
where
the
soil
and
moisture
conditions
are
favorable
for
rapid
growth
under
the
other
plan
the
seedlings
are
grown
in
nurseries
for
several
years
under
favorable
conditions
they
are
then
moved
to
the
field
and
set
out
in
permanent
plantations
chapter
x
the
national
forests
of
alaska
there
are
two
great
national
forests
in
alaska
they
cover
acres
or
about
per
cent
of
the
total
area
of
alaska
the
larger
of
these
woodlands
the
tongass
national
forest
is
estimated
to
contain
board
feet
of
timber
ripe
for
marketing
stands
of
board
feet
per
acre
are
not
infrequent
this
is
the
alaskan
forest
that
will
some
day
be
shipping
large
amounts
of
timber
to
the
states
it
has
over
miles
of
shore
line
and
ninety
per
cent
of
the
usable
timber
is
within
two
miles
of
tidewater
this
makes
it
easy
to
log
the
timber
and
load
the
lumber
directly
from
the
forests
to
the
steamers
this
forest
is
miles
closer
to
the
mainland
markets
than
is
the
other
alaskan
national
forest
in
most
of
the
national
forests
the
rangers
ride
around
their
beats
on
horseback
the
foresters
in
the
tongass
use
motor
boats
they
travel
in
couples
two
men
to
a
boat
which
is
provided
with
comfortable
eating
and
sleeping
quarters
the
rangers
live
on
the
boat
all
the
time
during
the
summer
they
work
sixteen
to
twenty
hours
daily
the
days
are
long
and
the
nights
short
and
they
must
travel
long
distances
between
points
of
work
on
such
runs
one
man
steers
the
boat
and
watches
the
forested
shoreline
for
three
or
four
hours
at
a
time
while
his
mate
reads
or
sleeps
then
they
change
off
in
this
way
they
are
able
to
make
the
most
efficient
use
of
the
long
periods
of
daylight
the
other
big
timberland
in
alaska
is
the
chugach
national
forest
it
is
a
smaller
edition
of
the
tongass
forest
its
trees
are
not
so
large
and
the
stand
of
timber
only
about
as
heavy
as
in
the
tongass
experts
estimate
that
it
contains
board
feet
of
lumber
western
hemlock
predominates
there
is
also
much
spruce
poplar
and
birch
stands
of
to
feet
of
lumber
an
acre
are
not
unusual
in
the
future
the
lumber
of
the
chugach
national
forest
will
play
an
important
part
in
the
industrial
life
of
alaska
even
now
it
is
used
by
the
fishing
mining
railroad
and
agricultural
interests
on
account
of
its
great
distance
from
the
markets
of
the
pacific
northwest
it
will
be
a
long
time
before
lumber
from
this
forest
will
be
exported
the
timber
in
the
tongass
national
forest
runs
per
cent
western
hemlock
and
per
cent
sitka
spruce
the
other
per
cent
consists
of
western
red
cedar
yellow
cypress
pine
cottonwood
and
white
fir
the
yellow
cypress
is
very
valuable
for
cabinet
making
all
these
species
except
the
cedar
are
suitable
for
pulp
manufacture
peculiarly
enough
considerable
of
the
lumber
used
in
alaska
for
box
shooks
in
the
canneries
and
in
building
work
is
imported
from
the
united
states
the
local
residents
do
not
think
their
native
timber
is
as
good
as
that
which
they
import
alaska
will
probably
develop
into
one
of
the
principal
paper
sources
of
the
united
states
our
national
forests
in
alaska
contain
approximately
cords
of
timber
suitable
for
paper
manufacture
experts
report
that
these
forests
could
produce
cords
of
pulpwood
annually
for
centuries
without
depletion
about
tons
of
pulpwood
annually
are
now
required
to
keep
us
supplied
with
enough
paper
the
tongass
national
forest
could
easily
supply
of
this
amount
indefinitely
this
forest
is
also
rich
in
water
power
it
would
take
more
than
horses
to
produce
as
much
power
as
that
which
the
streams
and
rivers
of
southern
alaska
supply
the
western
hemlock
and
sitka
spruce
are
the
best
for
paper
making
the
spruce
trees
are
generally
sound
and
of
good
quality
the
hemlock
trees
are
not
so
good
being
subject
to
decay
at
the
butts
this
often
causes
fluted
trunks
the
butt
logs
from
such
trees
usually
are
inferior
this
defect
in
the
hemlock
reduces
its
market
value
to
about
that
of
the
spruce
for
paper
making
some
of
the
paper
mills
in
british
columbia
are
now
using
these
species
of
pulpwood
and
report
that
they
make
paper
the
pulp
logs
are
floated
down
to
the
paper
mill
in
the
mill
the
bark
is
removed
from
the
logs
special
knives
remove
all
the
knots
and
cut
the
logs
into
pieces
twelve
inches
long
and
six
inches
thick
these
sticks
then
pass
into
a
powerful
grinding
machine
which
tears
them
into
small
chips
the
chips
are
cooked
in
special
steamers
until
they
are
soft
the
softened
chips
are
beaten
to
pieces
in
large
vats
until
they
form
a
pasty
pulp
the
pulp
is
spread
over
an
endless
belt
of
woven
wire
cloth
of
small
mesh
the
water
runs
off
and
leaves
a
sheet
of
wet
pulp
which
then
is
run
between
a
large
number
of
heated
and
polished
steel
cylinders
which
press
and
dry
the
pulp
into
sheets
of
paper
finally
it
is
wound
into
large
rolls
ready
for
commercial
use
if
a
pulp
and
paper
industry
is
built
up
in
alaska
it
will
be
of
great
benefit
to
that
northern
country
it
will
increase
the
population
by
creating
a
demand
for
more
labor
it
will
aid
the
farming
operations
by
making
a
home
market
for
their
products
it
will
improve
transportation
and
develop
all
kinds
of
business
altogether
feet
of
lumber
have
been
cut
and
sold
from
the
national
forests
of
alaska
in
the
past
ten
years
this
material
has
been
made
into
such
products
as
piling
saw
logs
and
shingle
bolts
all
this
lumber
has
been
used
in
alaska
and
none
of
it
has
been
exported
much
of
the
timber
was
cut
so
that
it
would
fall
almost
into
then
the
logs
were
fastened
together
in
rafts
and
towed
to
the
sawmills
one
typical
raft
of
logs
contained
more
than
feet
of
lumber
it
is
not
unusual
for
spruce
trees
in
alaska
to
attain
a
diameter
of
from
six
to
nine
feet
and
to
contain
or
feet
of
lumber
southeastern
alaska
has
many
harbors
which
are
open
the
year
round
practically
all
the
timber
in
that
section
is
controlled
by
the
government
and
is
within
the
tongass
national
forest
this
means
that
this
important
crop
will
be

chapter
xi
progress
in
state
forestry
the
rapid
depletion
and
threatened
exhaustion
of
the
timber
supply
in
the
more
thickly
populated
sections
of
the
east
has
prompted
several
of
the
states
to
initiate
action
looking
toward
the
conservation
of
their
timber
resources
as
far
back
as
a
forestry
commission
was
appointed
in
new
hampshire
to
formulate
a
forest
policy
for
the
state
vermont
took
similar
action
two
years
later
followed
within
the
next
few
years
by
many
of
the
northeastern
and
lake
states
these
commissions
were
mainly
boards
of
inquiry
for
the
purpose
of
gathering
reliable
information
upon
which
to
report
with
recommendations
for
the
adoption
of
a
state
forest
policy
as
a
result
of
the
inquiries
forestry
departments
were
established
in
a
number
of
states
the
report
of
the
new
york
commission
of
resulted
in
forest
legislation
in
creating
a
forestry
department
and
providing
for
the
acquisition
of
state
forests
liberal
appropriations
were
made
from
time
to
time
for
this
purpose
until
now
the
state
forests
embrace
nearly
acres
the
largest
of
any
single
state
new
york
state
forests
were
created
especially
for
the
protection
of
the
adirondack
and
catskill
regions
as
great
camping
and
hunting
grounds
and
not
for
timber
production
the
people
of
the
state
were
so
fearful
that
through
political
manipulation
this
vast
forest
resource
might
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
timber
exploiters
that
a
constitutional
amendment
was
proposed
and
adopted
absolutely
prohibiting
the
cutting
of
green
timber
from
the
state
lands
thus
while
new
york
owns
large
areas
of
state
forest
land
it
is
unproductive
so
far
as
furnishing
timber
supplies
to
the
state
is
concerned
it
is
held
distinctly
for
the
recreation
it
affords
to
campers
and
hunters
and
contains
many
famous
summer
resorts
state
forestry
in
pennsylvania
began
in
when
a
commission
was
appointed
to
study
conditions
resulting
in
the
establishment
of
a
commission
of
forestry
in
two
years
later
an
act
was
passed
providing
for
the
purchase
of
state
forests
at
the
present
time
pennsylvania
has
acres
of
state
forest
land
unlike
those
of
new
york
pennsylvania
forests
were
acquired
and
are
managed
primarily
for
timber
production
although
the
recreational
uses
are
not
overlooked
the
large
areas
of
lands
in
the
lake
states
suitable
mainly
for
timber
growing
enabled
this
section
to
create
extensive
state
forests
without
the
necessity
of
purchase
as
was
the
case
in
new
york
and
pennsylvania
as
a
result
wisconsin
has
nearly
acres
of
state
forest
land
minnesota
about
and
michigan
about
acres
south
dakota
with
a
relatively
small
area
of
forest
land
has
set
aside
acres
for
state
forest
a
number
of
other
states
have
initiated
a
policy
of
acquiring
state
forest
lands
notably
new
hampshire
vermont
massachusetts
connecticut
new
jersey
maryland
and
indiana
each
with
small
areas
but
likely
to
be
greatly
increased
within
the
next
few
years
under
the
development
of
present
policies
other
states
are
falling
in
line
with
this
forward
movement
there
are
but
acres
in
state
forests
in
the
united
states
this
is
only
per
cent
of
the
and
denuded
land
in
the
country
which
is
useful
only
for
tree
production
the
lack
of
funds
prevents
many
states
from
embarking
more
extensively
in
this
work
many
states
set
aside
only
a
few
thousand
a
year
others
that
are
more
progressive
and
realize
the
need
of
forestry
extension
spend
annually
from
one
hundred
thousand
to
five
hundred
thousand
dollars
foresters
are
generally
agreed
that
as
much
as
per
cent
of
the
forest
land
of
every
state
should
be
publicly
owned
for
producing
large
sized
timber
requiring
to
one
hundred
years
to
grow
and
which
the
private
owner
would
not
be
interested
in
producing
national
state
or
communal
forests
must
supply
it
all
of
these
combined
comprise
a
very
small
part
of
the
forests
of
most
of
the
states
so
that
much
larger
areas
must
be
acquired
by
the
states
and
the
national
government
to
safeguard
our
future
timber
supplies
not
less
than
states
are
actually
engaged
in
state
forestry
work
many
of
them
have
forestry
departments
which
in
states
like
new
york
and
pennsylvania
having
large
areas
of
state
forests
are
devoted
largely
to
the
care
and
protection
of
these
lands
in
other
states
having
no
state
forests
the
work
is
largely
educational
in
character
the
most
notable
progress
in
forestry
has
been
made
in
fire
protection
all
states
having
forestry
departments
lay
especial
emphasis
upon
forest
protection
since
it
is
recognized
that
only
by
protecting
the
forests
from
fire
is
it
possible
to
succeed
in
growing
timber
crops
in
fact
in
most
cases
the
prevention
of
fire
in
itself
is
sufficient
to
insure
and
productive
forests
pennsylvania
is
spending
annually
in
protecting
her
forests
from
fire
the
co√∂peration
of
the
federal
government
under
a
provision
of
the
weeks
law
which
appropriates
small
sums
of
money
for
forest
protection
provided
the
state
will
appropriate
an
equal
or
greater
amount
has
done
much
to
encourage
the
establishment
of
systems
of
forest
protection
in
many
of
the
states

only
by

planting
present
another
big
problem
in
state
forestry
many
of
the
states
have
established
state
forestry
nurseries
for
the
growing
of
tree
seedlings
to
plant
up
these
lands
the
trees
are
either

away
or
sold
at
cost
millions
being
distributed
each
year
indicating
a
live
interest
and
growing
sentiment
in
waste
lands
the
appalling
waste
of
timber
resources
through
excessive
and
reckless
cutting
amounting
to
forest
devastation
is
deplorable
but
we
are
helpless
to
prevent
it
since
the
bulk
of
woodlands
are
privately
owned
and
there
are
no
effective
laws
limiting
the
cutting
of
timber
with
a
view
to
conserving
the
supply
the
only
means
of
bringing
about
regulated
cutting
on
private
lands
is
through
co√∂peration
with
the
owners
this
is
being
done
in
some
of
the
states
in
a
limited
way
through
educational
methods
involving
investigations
reports
demonstrations
and
other
means
of
bringing
improved
forestry
practices
to
the
attention
of
existing
owners
and
enlisting
their
co√∂peration
and
support
in
forest
conservation
forestry
in
the
state
or
in
the
nation
seems
to
progress
no
more
rapidly
than
the
timber
disappears
in
fact
the
individual
states
do
not
take
precaution
to
conserve
their
timber
supplies
until
exhaustion
is
threatened
the
damage
has
been
largely
done
before
the
remedy
is
considered
we
are
today
paying
a
tremendous
toll
for
our
lack
of
foresight
in
these
matters
as
a
timber
producing
state
becomes
a
timber
importing
state
a
condition
existing
in
most
of
the
eastern
and
middle
states
we
begin
to
pay
a
heavy
toll
in
the
loss
of
home
industries
dependent
upon
wood
and
also
in
heavy
freight
charges
on
lumber
that
we
must
import
from
distant
points
to
supply
our
needs
in
many
states
the
expenditure
of
an
amount
for
reforestation
and
fire
protection
equal
to
this
freight
bill
on
imported
lumber
would
make
the
state
in
a
decade
instead
of
becoming
worse
off
each
year
marked
progress
has
been
made
along
the
lines
indicated
but
few
of
the
states
have
begun
to
measure
up
to
their
full
responsibility

protecting
their

the
public

aid
the

individuals
in
fighting
forest
fires
the
greatest
menace
that
modern
forestry
has
to
face
a
national
policy
is
needed
which
will
permit
the
private
owner
to
grow
trees
which
will
give
him
fair
and
reasonable
profit
when
sold
the
farmers
of
this
country
use
about
of
all
the
lumber
consumed
annually
they
own
approximately
acres
of
timber
in
their
farm
woodlots
if
farmers
would
devote
a
little
time
and
labor
to
the
permanent
upkeep
and
improvement
of
their
timber
they
would
aid
in
decreasing
the
danger
of
a
future
lumber
famine
if
they
would
but
keep
track
of
the

production
of
their
woodlands
as
closely
as
they
do
of
their
corn

crops
american
forestry
would
benefit
greatly
between
and
the
forest
service
established
two
forest
experiment
stations
in
california
and
one
each
in
washington
idaho
colorado
and
arizona
they
devote
the
same
degree
of
science
and
skill
to
the
solution
of
tree
growing
and
lumbering
problems
as
the
agricultural
experiment
stations
give
to
questions
of
farm
and
crop
management
despite
the
fact
that
these
forestry
stations
did
fine
work
for
the
sections
that
they
served
recently
a
number
of
them
had
to
close
due
to
lack
of
funds
congress
does
not
yet
realize
the
importance
of
this
work
more
forest
experiment
stations
are
needed
throughout
the
country
such
problems
as
what
kinds
of
trees
are
best
to
grow
must
be
solved
of
the
species
of
trees
in
this
country
are
important
commercially
they
all
differ
in
their
histories
characteristics
and
requirements
research
and
study
should
be
made
of
these
trees
in
the
sections
where
they
grow
best
our
knowledge
regarding
tree
planting
and
the
peculiarities
of
the
different
species
is
as
yet
very
meagre
we
must
discover
the
best
methods
of
cutting
trees
and
of
disposing
of
the
slash
we
must
investigate
rates
of
growth
yields
and
other
problems
of
forest
management
we
must
study
the
effect
of
climate
on
forest
fires
we
must
continue
experiments
in
order
to
develop
better
systems
of
fire
protection
we
need
more
forest
experiment
stations
to
promote
the
production
of
more
timber
twenty
of
our
leading
industries
utilize
lumber
as
their
most
important
raw
material
different
industries
use
specialized
grades
and
quality
of
lumber
in
the
manufacture
of
many
products
this
use
of
lumber
includes
general
mill
work
and
planing
mill
products
such
as
building
crates
and
boxes
vehicles
railroad
cars
furniture
agricultural
implements
and
wooden
ware
our
manufacturers
make
and
use
more
than
two
hundred
and
different
kinds
of
paper
including
newsprint
boxboard
building
papers
book
papers
and
many
kinds
of
specialty
papers
the
forest
experiment
stations
would
help
solve
the
practical
problems
of
these
many
industries
they
could
work
out
methods
by
which
to
maintain
our
forests
and
still
turn
out
the
to
forty
billion
board
feet
of
lumber
used
each
year
they
are
needed
to
determine
methods
of
increasing
our
annual
cut
for
pulp

they
are
necessary
so
that
we
can
increase
our
annual

then
have
to
rely
mostly
on
the
pacific

wisconsin

before
wisconsin
now
harvests
a

that
is

smaller
than
that
of
massachusetts
experts
believe
that
a
forest
experiment
station
in
the
lake

would
stimulate
production
so
that
enough
lumber
could
be
produced
to
satisfy
the
local

not

in

among
the

feasible
and
have
found
that

chapter

why
the
united
states
should
practice
forestry
of
late
years
the
demand
for
lumber
by
the
world
trade
has
been
very
great
most
of
the
countries
which
have
extensive
forests
are
taking
steps
to
protect
their
supplies
they
limit
cutting
and
restrict
exports
of
timber
both
new
zealand
and
switzerland
have
passed
laws
of
this
kind
sweden
exports
much
lumber
but
by
law
forbids
the
cutting
of
timber
in
excess
of
the
annual
growth
norway
regulates
private
cutting
england
is
planning
to
plant
acres
of
new
forest
reserve
this
body
of
timber
when
ready
for
cutting
would
be
sufficient
to
supply
her
home
needs
in
time
of
emergency
for
at
least
three
years
france
is
enlarging
her
forest
nurseries
and
protecting
her
timber
in
every
possible
way
even
russia
a
country
with
huge
forest
tracts
is
beginning
to
practice
conservation
russia
now
requires
that
all
timber
cut
under
concession
shall
be
replaced
by
plantings
of
trees
for
many
years
the
united
states
and
china
were
the
greatest
wasters
of
forest
resources
under
the
sun
now
this
country
has
begun
to
practice
scientific
forestry
on
a
large
scale
so
that
china
now
has
the
forests
in
the
world
japan
on
the
other
hand
handles
her
forests
efficiently
and
has
established
a
national
forestry
school
austria
norway
sweden
and
italy
have
devoted
much
time
labor
and
money
to
the
development
of
practical
systems
of
forestry
turkey
greece
spain
and
portugal
all
follow
sane
and
sensible
forestry
practices
even
russia
takes
care
of
her
national
timberlands
and
annually
draws
enormous
incomes
from
their
maintenance
france
and
germany
both
have
highly
successful
forestry
systems
switzerland
australia
and
new
zealand
are
using
their
forests
in
a
practical
manner
and
saving
sufficient
supplies
of
wood
for
posterity
history
tells
us
that
the
forests
first
were
protected
as
the
homes
of
wild
game
little
attention
was
paid
to
the
trees
in
those
days
the
forests
were
places
to
hunt
and
abodes
devoted
to
wild
animals
scientific
forestry
was
first
studied
and
practised
widely
in
the
nineteenth
century
its
development
and
expansion
have
been
rapid
germany
still
leads
as
one
of
the
most
prominent
countries
that
practices
efficient
forestry
german
forests
are
now
said
to
be
worth
more
than
france
has
over
acres
of
fine
publicly
owned
forests
in
addition
to
private
forests
which
yield
a
net
income
of
more
than
an
acre
a
year
to
the
government
the
french
have
led
in
extending
reforestation
on
denuded
mountain
sides
british
india
has
forests
which
cover
over
square
miles
of
area
these
timberlands
return
a
net

of
from
to
a

india
now
protects
more
than
square
miles
of
forest
against
fire
at
an
annual
cost
of
less
than
half
a

forest
experts
say
that
the
united
states
which
produces
more
than
of
all
the
sawed
timber
in
the
world
should
pay
more
attention
to
the
export
lumber
business
such
trade
must
be
built
up
on
the
basis
of
a
permanent
supply
of
timber
this
means
the
practice
of
careful
conservation
and
the
replacement
of
forests
that
have
been
destroyed
we
can
not
export
timber
from
such
meagre
reserves
as
the
pine
forests
of
the
south
which
will
not
supply
even
the
domestic
needs
of
the
region
for
much
more
than
ten
or
fifteen
years
longer
many
of
our
timber
men
desire
to
develop
extensive
export
trade
our
sawmills
are
large
enough
and
numerous
enough
to
cut
much
more
timber
annually
than
we
need
in
this
country
however
the
danger
is
that
we
shall
only
abuse
our
forests
the
more
and
further
deplete
the
timber
reserves
of
future
generations
as
a
result
of
extensive
export
trade
if
such
trade
is
developed
on
a
large
scale
a
conservative
practical
national
forestry
policy
must
be
worked
out
endorsed
and
lived
up
to
by
every
producing
exporter
the
forest
service
reports
that
before
the
world
war
we
were
exporting
annually
board
feet
of
lumber
and
sawlogs
not
including
ties
staves
and
similar
material
this
material
consisted
of
southern
yellow
pine
douglas
fir
white
oak
redwood
white

yellow
poplar
cypress
walnut
hickory
ash
basswood
and
similar
kinds
of

the
exports
were
made
up
of
per
cent
softwoods
and
per
cent
hardwoods
the
export
trade
consumed
about
per
cent
of
our
annual
lumber
cut
southern
yellow
pine
was
the
most
popular
timber
shipped
abroad
of
the
total
export
was
of
this
material
during
the
four
years
before
the
war
our
imports
of
lumber
from
foreign
countries
amounted
to
about
board
feet
of
lumber
and
logs
in
imports
exceeded
exports
by
board
feet
in
addition
to
this
lumber
we
also
shipped
in
largely
from
canada
cords
of
pulp

tons
of

and
close
to
a

some
of
the

such
as

pulp
and

also
came
from
sweden
norway
germany
spain
the
netherlands
and
the
united
kingdom
as
a
result
of
the
war
european
countries
for
several
years
can
use

a

above
their
normal
requirements
for

england
needs

a

more
than
normally
france
feet
italy
feet
belgium
and
spain
feet
apiece
even
before
the

there
was
a
great
deficiency
of
timber
in
parts
of
europe
it
amounted
to

a

and
was
supplied
by
russia
the
united

canada
sweden
and
a
few
other
countries
of
western

if
we
can
regulate
cutting
and
replenish
our

as
they
deserve
there
is
a
remarkable
opportunity
for
us
to
build
up

by

business
has
been
second
only
to
that
of
russia
in
total
amount
the
value
of
the
timber
that
we
exported
was
larger
than
that
of
russia
because
much
of
our
timber
that
was
sent
abroad
consisted
of
the
best
grades
of
material
grown
in
this
country
in
the
future
we
shall
have
to
compete
in
the
softwood
export
business
with
russia
finland
sweden
norway
and
the
various
states
of
southeastern
europe
which
sell
lumber
in
the
hardwood
business
we
have
only
a
limited
number
of
rivals
with
the
exception
of
a
small
section
of
eastern

our

forests
are

we
export
hickory
black

white
and
red
oak
even
to
russia
and
sweden
countries
that
are
our
keenest
rivals
in
the
softwood
export
business
europe
wants
export
lumber
from
our
eastern
states
because
the
transportation
costs
on
such
material
are
low
she
does
not
like
to
pay
heavy
costs
of
hauling
timber
from
the
pacific
coast
to
the
atlantic
seaboard
and
then
have
it
reshipped
by
water
our
eastern

are
practically
exhausted
our

of
export
lumber
except
douglas
fir
are
declining
most
of
the
kinds
of
export
timber
that
europe
wants
we
need
right
at
home
we
have
only
about
feet
of
southern
yellow
pine
left
yet
this
material
composes
of
our
annual
shipments
abroad
we
are
cutting
this
material
at
the
rate
of
board
feet
a
year
some
authorities
believe
that
our
reserves
will
last
only
sixteen
years
unless
measures
to
protect
them
are
put
into
effect
at
once
at
the
present
rate
of
cutting
pine
trees
our
outputs
of
naval
stores
including
turpentine
and
rosin
are
dwindling
we
can
not
afford
to
increase
our
export
of
southern
yellow
pine
unless
reforestation
is
started
on
all
land
suitable
for
that
purpose
our
pine
lands
of
the
southern
states
must
be
restocked
and
made
permanently
productive
then
they
could
maintain
the
turpentine
industry
provide
all
the
lumber
of
this
kind
we
need
for
home
use
and
supply
a
larger
surplus
for
export
although
our
supplies
of
douglas
fir
western
white
pine
sugar
pine
and
western
yellow
pine
are
still
large
they
will
have
to
bear
an
extra
burden
when
all
the
southern
pine
is
gone
this
indicates
that
the
large
supplies
of
these
woods
will
not
last
as
long
as
we
would
wish
to
prevent
overtaxing
their
production
it
is
essential
that
part
of
the
load
be
passed
to
the
southern
pine
lands
by
proper
protection
and
renewal
of
our
forests
we
can
increase
our
production
of
lumber
and
still
have
a
permanent
supply
the
forest
service
estimates
that
by
protecting
our
and
waste
lands
from
fire
and
practicing
care
to
secure
reproduction
after
logging
on
our
remaining
virgin
forest
land
we
can
produce
annually
at
least
cubic
feet
of
wood
including
board
feet
of
sawtimber
such
a
production
would
meet
indefinitely
the
needs
of
our
growing
population
and
still
leave
an
amount
of
timber
available
for
export
our
hardwoods
need
protection
as
well
as
our
softwoods
ten
per
cent
of
our
yearly
cut
of
valuable
white
oak
is
shipped
overseas
in

we
annually
waste
much
of
our
best
oak
in
the
preparation
of
split
staves
for
export
at
the
present
rate
of
cutting
the
supply
it
is
said
will
not
last
more
than
years
we
ship
abroad
about
seven
per

of
our
poplar
lumber
our
supplies
of
this
material
will
be
exhausted
in
about
twenty
years
if
the
present
rate
of
cutting
continues
we
sell
to
foreign
countries
at
least
of
our
cut
of
black
walnut
which
will
be
exhausted
in
ten
to
twelve
years
unless
present
methods
are
reformed
our
supplies
of
hickory
ash
and
basswood
will
be
used
up
in
twenty
to
thirty
years
we
need
all
this
hardwood
lumber
for
future
domestic
purposes
however
the
furniture
factories
of
france
spain
and
italy
are
behind
on
orders
they
need
hardwood
and
much
of
our
valuable
hardwood
timber
is
being
shipped
to
europe
experience
has
proved
that
correct
systems
of
handling
the
private
forests
can
not
be
secured
by
mere
suggestions
or
education
no
ordinary
method
of
public
co√∂peration
has
been
worked
out
which
produces
the
desired
results
it
is
necessary
that
suitable
measures
be
adopted
to
induce
private
owners
to
preserve
and
protect
their
woodlands
the
timberlands
must
be
protected
against
forest
fires
timber
must
be
cut
so
as
to
aid
natural
reproduction
of
forest
lands
must
be
reforested
if
such
methods
were
practiced
and
national
state
and
municipal
forests
were
established
and
extended
our
lumber
problem
would
largely
solve
itself
we
not
only
should
produce
a
large
permanent
supply
of
timber
for
domestic
use
but
also
should
have
great
reserves
available
for
export
under
such
conditions
the
united
states
would
become
the
greatest
supply
source
in
the
world
for
lumber
chapter
xv
why
the
lumberman
should
practice
forestry
the
lumber
industry
of
this
country
can
aid
reforestation
by
practicing
better
methods
it
can
harvest
its
annual
crop
of
timber
without
injuring
the
future
production
of
the
forests
it
can
limit
forest
fires
by
leaving
the
woods
in
a
safe
condition
after
it
has
removed
the
timber
some
private
timber
owners
who
make
a
living
out
of
cutting
lumber
have
even
reached
the
stage
where
they
are
planting
trees
they
are
coming
to
appreciate
the
need
for
replacing
trees
that
they
cut
down
in
order
that
new
growth
may
develop
to
furnish
future
timber
crops
the
trouble
in
this
country
has
been
that
the
lumbermen
have
harvested
the
crop
of
the
forests
in
the
shortest
possible
time
instead
of
spreading
out
the
work
over
a
long
period
most
of
our
privately
owned
forests
have
been
temporarily
ruined
by
practices
of
this
sort
the
aim
of
the
ordinary
lumberman
is
to
fell
the
trees
and
reduce
them
to
lumber
with
the
least
labor
possible
he
does
not
exercise
special
care
as
to
how
the
tree
is
cut
down
he
pays
little
attention
to
the
protection
of
young
trees
and
new
growth
he
cuts
the
tree
to
fall
in
the
direction
that
best
serves
his
purpose
no
matter
whether
this
means
that
the
forest
giant
will
crush
and
seriously
cripple
many
young
trees
he
wastes
large
parts
of
the
trunk
in
cutting
he
leaves
the
tops
and
chips
and
branches
scattered
over
the
ground
to
dry
out
they
develop
into
a
fire
trap
as
generally
followed
the
ordinary
method
of
lumbering
is
destructive
of
the
forests
it
ravages
the
future
production
of
the
timberlands
it
pays
no
heed
to
the
young
growth
of
the
forest
it
does
not
provide
for
the
proper
growth
and
development
of
the
future
forest
our
vast
stretches
of
desolate
and
deserted
lands
are
silent
witnesses
to
the
ruin
which
has
been
worked
by
the
practice
of
destructive
lumbering
fortunately
a
change
for
the
better
is
now
developing
with
the
last
of
our
timberland
riches
in
sight
on
the
pacific
coast
the
lumbering
industry
is
coming
to
see
that
it
must
prepare
for
the
future
consequently
operators
are
handling
the
woods
better
than
ever
before
they
now
are
trying
to
increase
both
the
production
and
permanent
value
of
the
remaining
forests
they
aim
to
harvest
the
tree
yield
more
thoroughly
and
to
extend
their
cuttings
over
many
years
they
appreciate
that
it
is
necessary
to
protect
and
preserve
the
forest
at
the
same
time
that
profitable
tree
crops
are
being
removed
they
see
the
need
for
saving
and
increasing
young
growth
and
for
protecting
the
woodlands
against
fire
if
only
these
methods
of
forestry
had
been
observed
from
the
time
the
early
settlers
felled
the
first
trees
not
only
would
our
forests
be
producing
at
present
all
the
lumber
we
could
use
but
also
the
united
states
would
be
the
greatest
country
in
the
world
illustration
what
some
kinds
of
timber
cutting
do
to
a
forest
it
will
never
be
possible
to
stop
timber
cutting
entirely
in
this
country
nor
would
it
be
desirable
to
do
so
the
demands
for
building
material
fuel
wood
pulp
and
the
like
are
too
great
to
permit
of
such
a
condition
the
nation
would
suffer
if
all
forest
cutting
was
suspended
there
is
a
vital
need
however
of
perpetuating
our
remaining
forests
wasteful
lumbering
practices
should
be
stopped
only
trees
that
are
ready
for
harvest
should
be
felled
they
should
be
cut
under
conditions
which
will
protect
the
best
interests
and
production
of
the
timberlands
as
a
class
our
lumbermen
are
no
more
selfish
or
greedy
than
men
in
many
other
branches
of
business
they
have
worked
under
peculiar
conditions
in
the
united
states
our
population
was
small
as
compared
with
our
vast
forest
resources
conditions
imposed
in
france
and
germany
where
the
population
is
so
dense
that
more
conservative
systems
of
lumbering
are
generally
practiced
were
not
always
applicable
in
this
country
furthermore
our
lumbermen
have
known
little
about
scientific
forestry
this
science
is
comparatively
new
in
america
all
our
forestry
schools
are
still
in
the
early
stages
of
their
development
as
lumbermen
learn
more
about
the
value
of
modern
forestry
they
gradually
are
coming
to
practice
its
principles
the
early
lumbermen
often
made
mistakes
in
estimating
the
timber
yields
of
the
forests
they
also
neglected
to
provide
for
the
future
production
of
the
woodlands
after
the
virgin
timber
was
removed
those
who
followed
in
their
steps
have
learned
by
these
errors
what
mistakes
to
avoid
our
lumbermen
lead
the
world
in
skill
and
ingenuity
they
have
worked
out
most
efficient
methods
of
felling
and
logging
the
trees
many
foreign
countries
have
long
practiced
forestry
and
lumbering
yet
their
lumbermen
can
not
compete
with
the
americans
when
it
comes
to
a
matter
of
ingenuity
in
the
woods
american
woods
and
methods
of
logging
are
peculiar
they
would
no
more
fit
under
european
forest
conditions
than
would
foreign
systems
be
suitable
in
this
country
american
lumbermen
are
slowly
coming
to
devise
and
follow
a
combination
method
which
includes
all
the
good
points
of
foreign
forestry
revised
to
apply
to
our
conditions
we
can
keep
our
remaining
forests
alive
and
piece
out
their
production
over
a
long
period
if
we
practice
conservation
methods
generally
throughout
the
country
our
remaining
forests
can
be
lumbered
according
to
the
rules
of
practical
forestry
without
great
expense
to
the
owners
in
the
long
run
they
will
realize
much
larger
returns
from
handling
the
woods
in
this
way
this
work
of
saving
the
forests
should
begin
at
once
it
should
be
practiced
in
every
state
our
and
idle
lands
should
be
put
to
work
our
forest
lands
should
be
handled
just
like
fertile
farming
lands
that
produce
big
crops
the
farmer
does
not
attempt
to
take
all
the
fertility
out
of
the
land
in
the
harvest
of
one
bumper
crop
he
handles
the
field
so
that
it
will
produce
profitable
crops
every
season
he
fertilizes
the
soil
and
tills
it
so
as
to
add
to
its
productive
power
similarly
our
forests
should
be
worked
so
that
they
will
yield
successive
crops
of
lumber
year
after
year
lumbermen
who
own
forests
from
which
they
desire
to
harvest
a
timber
crop
should
first
of
all
survey
the
woods
or
have
some
experienced
forester
do
this
work
to
decide
on
what
trees
should
be
cut
and
the
best
methods
of
logging
to
follow
the
trees
to
be
cut
should
be
selected
carefully
and
marked
the
owner
should
determine
how
best
to
protect
the
young
and
standing
timber
during
lumbering
he
should
decide
on
what
plantings
he
will
make
to
replace
the
trees
that
are
cut
he
should
survey
and
estimate
the
future
yield
of
the
forest
he
should
study
the
young
trees
and
decide
about
when
they
will
be
ripe
to
cut
and
what
they
will
yield
from
this
information
he
can
determine
his
future
income
from
the
forest
and
the
best
ways
of
handling
the
woodlands
under
present
conditions
in
this
country
only
those
trees
should
be
cut
from
our
forests
which
are
mature
and
ready
for
the
ax
this
means
that
the
harvest
must
be
made
under
conditions
where
there
are
enough
young
trees
to
take
the
place
of
the
trees
that
are
removed
cutting
is
best
done
during
the
winter
when
the
trees
are
dormant
if
the
cutting
is
performed
during
the
spring
or
summer
the
bark
twigs
and
leaves
of
the
surrounding
young
growth
may
be
seriously
damaged
by
the
falling
trees
the
trees
should
be
cut
as
low
to
the
ground
as
is
practicable
as
high
stumps
waste
valuable
timber
care
should
be
taken
so
that
they
will
not
break
or
split
in
falling
trees
should
be
dropped
so
that
they
will
not
crush
young
seedlings
and
sapling
growth
as
they
fall
it
is
no
more
difficult
or
costly
to
throw
a
tree
so
that
it
will
not
injure
young
trees
than
it
is
to
drop
it
anywhere
without
regard
for
the
future
of
the
forest
directly
after
cutting
the
fallen
timber
should
be
trimmed
so
as
to
remove
branches
that
are
crushing
down
any
young
growth
or
seedling
in
some
forests
the
young
growth
is
so
thick
that
it
is
impossible
to
throw
trees
without
falling
them
on
some
of
these
baby
trees
which
will
spring
back
into
place
again
if
the
heavy
branches
are
removed
at
once
the
top
of
the
tree
should
be
trimmed
so
that
it
will
lie
close
to
the
ground
under
such
conditions
it
will
rot
rapidly
and
be
less
of
a
fire
menace
the
dry
tops
of
trees
which
lodge
above
the
ground
are
most
dangerous
sources
of
fire
as
they
burn
easily
and
rapidly
the
lumbermen
can
also
aid
the
future
development
of
the
forests
by
using
care
in
skidding
and
hauling
the
logs
to
the
yard
or
mill
care
should
be
exercised
in
the
logging
operations
not
to
tear
or
damage
the
bark
of
trunks
of
standing
timber
if
possible
only
the
trees
of
unimportant
timber
species
should
be
cut
for
making
corduroy
roads
in
the
forests
this
will
be
a
saving
of
valuable
material
in
lumbering
operations
as
practiced
in
this
country
the
logs
are
usually
moved
to
the
sawmills
on
sleds
or
by
means
of
logging
railroads
if
streams
are
near
by
the
logs
are
run
into
the
water
and
floated
to
the
mill
if
the
current
is
not
swift
enough
special
dams
are
built
then
when
enough
logs
are
gathered
for
the
drive
the
dam
is
opened
and
the
captive
waters
flood
away
rapidly
and
carry
the
logs
to
the
mill
on
larger
streams
and
rivers
the
logs
are

together
in

guide
the
logs
on
these
drives
on
arrival
at
the
sawmill
the
logs
are
reduced
to
lumber
many
different
kinds
of
saws
are
used
in
this
work
one
of
the
most
efficient
is
the
circular
saw
which
performs
rapid
work
it
is
so
wide
in
bite
however
that
it
wastes
much
wood
in
sawdust
for
example
in
cutting
four
boards
of
lumber
an
ordinary
circular
saw
wastes
enough
material
to
make
a
fifth
board
because
it
cuts
an
opening
that
is
of
an
inch
in
width
band
saws
although
they
do
not
work
at
such
high
speed
are
replacing
circular
saws
in
many
mills
because
they
are
less
wasteful
of
lumber
although
sawmills
try
to
prevent
waste
of
wood
by
converting
slabs
and
short
pieces
into
laths
and
shingles
large
amounts
of
refuse
such
as
sawdust
slabs
and
edgings
are
burned
each
season
as
a
rule
only
about
of
the

is
finally
used
for
construction
purposes

which

they

hence
expose

they
convert

which
would
yield
twice
as
great

return
if
allowed
to

for
four

longer
and
then

the
case
of
a

in

is
interesting
years
ago
the
farmer
who
owned

land
dug
up
fourteen
hundred
seedling
pines
which
were
growing
in
a
clump
and
set
them
out
on
the
sidehill
twenty
years
later
the
farmer
died
his
widow
sold
the
three
acres
of
young
pine
for
fifteen
years
later
the

again
changed

the

devoted
about
worth
of

this

a

realizes
a

the

of

is
cords

this
was

the

this
was
an

of
about
feet
an

the

farmers
should
prize

because
they
provide

it

there
are
more
than
acres
which
yield
an

of
about
a

the

compose
about
per

in

over
per

of

is
on

the
government
says
timber
raising
is
very
profitable
in
the
eastern
states
because
there
is
plenty
of
cheap
land
which
is
not
suitable
for
farming
while
the
rainfall
is
abundant
and
favors
rapid
tree
growth
furthermore
there
are
many
large
cities
which
use
enormous

both

our

are
producing
only
about
to
of
the
wood
supplies
which
they
could
grow
if
they
were
properly
managed
the
farmer
who
appreciates
the
importance
of
caring
for
his
home
forests
is
always
interested
in
knowing
how
much
timber
will
grow
on
an
acre
during
a
period
of
twelve
months
the
government
reports
that
where
the
farm
woodlots
are
fully
stocked
with
trees
and
for
an
acre
of
hardwoods
will
produce
from
to
one
cord
of
wood
a
cord
of
wood
is
equal
to
about
board
feet
of
lumber
a
pine
forest
will
produce
from
one
to
two
cords
of
wood
an
acre
the
growth
is
greater
in
the
warmer
southern
climate
than
it
is
in
the
north
where
the
growing
season
is
much
shorter
expert
foresters
say
that
posts
and
crossties
can
be
grown
in
from
ten
to
thirty
years
and
that
most
of
the
rapid
growing
trees
will
make
saw
timber
in
between
twenty
and
forty
years
after
the
farm
woodland
is
logged
a
new
stand
of
young
trees
will
develop
from
seeds
or
sprouts
from
the
stumps
farmers
find
that
it
is
profitable
to
harrow
the
ground
in
the
woodlands
to
aid
natural
reproduction
or
to
turn
hogs
into
the
timber
tract
to
rustle
a
living
as
these
animals
aid
in
scattering
the
seed
under
favorable
circumstances
it
is
also
noteworthy
that
the
most
vigorous
sprouts
come
from
the
clean
stumps
from
which
the
trees
were
cut
during
the
late
fall
winter
or
early
spring
before
the
sap
begins
to
flow
the
top
of
each
stump
should
be
cut
slanting
so
that
it
will
readily
shed
water
the
trees
that
reproduce
by
sprouts
include
the
oak
hickory
basswood
chestnut
gum
cottonwood
willows
and
young
and
pitch
pines
in
order
that
the
farm
woodland
may
be
kept
in
the
best
of
productive
condition
the
farmer
should
remove
for
firewood
the
trees
adapted
only
for
that
purpose
usually
removing
these
trees
improves
the
growth
of
the
remaining
trees
by
giving
them
better
chances
to
develop
trees
should
be
cut
whose
growth
has
been
stunted
because
trees
of
more
rapid
growth
crowded
them
out
diseased
trees
or
those
that
have
been
seriously
injured
by
insects
should
be
felled
in
sections
exposed
to
chestnut
blight
or
gypsy
moth
infection
it
is
advisable
to
remove
the
chestnut
and
birch
trees
before
they
are
damaged
seriously
it
is
wise
management
to
cut
the
trees
as
well
as
those
that
are
crooked
and
as
they
will
not
make
good
lumber
the
removal
of
these
undesirable
trees
improves
the
forest
by
providing
more
growing
space
for
the
sturdy
healthy
trees
sound
dead
trees
as
well
as
the
trees
that
crowd
the
fast
growing
varieties
should
be
cut
in
addition
where
such
less
valuable
trees
as
the
beech
birch
black
oak
jack
oak
or
black
gum
are
crowding
valuable
trees
like
the
sugar
maples
white
or
pines
yellow
poplar
or
white
oak
the
former
species
should
be
chopped
down
these
cutting
operations
should
be
done
with
the
least
possible
damage
to
the
living
and
young
trees
the
weed
trees
should
be
cut
down
just
as
the
weeds
are
hoed
out
of
a
field
of
corn
in
order
that
the
surviving
trees
may
make
better
growth
often
the
farmer
errs
in
marketing
his
tree
crops
there
have
been
numerous
instances
where
farmers
have
been
deluded
by
timber
cruisers
and
others
who
purchased
their
valuable
forest
tracts
for
a
mere
fraction
of
what
the
woodlands
were
really
worth
the
united
states
forest
service
and
state
forestry
departments
have
investigated
many
of
these
cases
and
its
experts
advise
farmers
who
are
planning
to
sell
tree
crops
to
get
prices
for
the
various
wood
products
from
as
many
sawmills
and
plants
as
possible
the
foresters
recommend
that
the
farmers
consult
with
their
neighbors
who
have
sold
timber
sometimes
it
may
pay
to
sell
the
timber
locally
if
the
prices
are
right
as
then
the
heavy
transportation
costs
are
eliminated
most
states
have
state
foresters
who
examine
woodlands
and
advise
the
owner
just
what
to
do
it
pays
to
advertise
in
the
newspapers
and
secure
as
many
competitive
bids
as
possible
for
the
timber
on
the
stump
generally
unless
the
prices
offered
for
such
timber
are
unusually
high
the
farmer
will
get
greater
returns
by
logging
and
sawing
the
timber
and
selling
it
in
the
form
of
lumber
and
other
wood
products
the
farmer
who
owns
a
large
forest
tract
should
have
some
reliable
and
experienced
timberman
carefully
inspect
his
timber
and
estimate
the
amount
and
value
the
owner
should
deal
with
only
responsible
buyers
he
should
use
a
written
agreement
in
selling
timber
particularly
where
the
purchaser
is
to
do
the
cutting
the
farm
woodland
owner
must
always
bear
in
mind
that
standing
timber
can
always
be
held
over
a
period
of
low
prices
without
rapid
deterioration
in
selling
lumber
the
best
plan
is
to
use
the
inferior
timber
at
home
for
building
and
repair
work
and
to
market
the
best
of
the
material
chapter

putting
wood
waste
to
work
for
many
years
technical
studies
of
wood
were
neglected
detailed
investigations
of
steel
concrete
oil
rubber
and
other
materials
were
made
but
wood
apparently
was
forgotten
it
has
been
only
during
the
last
decade
since
the
establishment
of
the
forest
products
laboratory
of
the
united
states
forest
service
at
madison
wisconsin
that
tests
and
experiments
to
determine
the
real
value
of
different
woods
have
been
begun
one
of
the
big
problems
of
the
government
scientists
at
that
station
which
is
conducted
in
co√∂peration
with
the
university
of
wisconsin
is
to
check
the
needless
waste
of
wood
by
actual
test
they
find
out
all
about
the
wasteful
practices
of
lumbering
in
the
woods
and
mills
then
they
try
to
educate
and
convert
the
lumbermen
and
manufacturers
away
from
such
practices
the
laboratory
experts
have
already
performed
more
than
tests
with
different
kinds
of
native
woods
as
a
result
of
these
experiments
these
woods
are
now
being
used
to
better
advantage
with
less
waste
in
the
building
and
manufacturing
industries
a
potential
saving
of
at
least
per
cent
of
the
timbers
used
for
building
purposes
is
promised
which
means
a
salvage
of
about
annually
as
a
result
of
strength
tests
of
southern
yellow
pine
and
douglas
fir
additional
tests
have
shown
that
the
red
heartwood
of
hickory
is
just
as
strong
and
serviceable
as
the
white
sap
wood
formerly
the
custom
has
been
to
throw
away
the
heartwood
as
useless
this
discovery
greatly
extends
the
use
of
our
hickory
supply
heretofore
the
custom
has
been
to
season
woods
by
drying
them
in
the
sun
this
method
of
curing
not
only
took
a
long
time
but
also
was
wasteful
and
expensive
the
forestry
scientists
and
lumbermen
have
now
improved
the
use
of
dry
kilns
and
artificial
systems
of
curing
green
lumber
now
more
than
of
the
leading
woods
such
as
douglas
fir
southern
yellow
pine
spruce
gum
and
oak
can
be
seasoned
in
the
kilns
in
short
time
it
used
to
take
about
two
years
of
air
drying
to
season
fir
and
spruce
at
present
the
artificial
kiln
performs
this
job
in
from
twenty
to
forty
days
the
lumber
is
just
as
strong
and
useful
for
construction
as
the
stock
tests
have
proved
that
kiln
drying
of
walnut
for
use
in
gun
stocks
or
airplane
propellers
in
some
cases
reduced
the
waste
of
material
from
to
per
cent
the
material
was
ready
for
use
in
the
time
it
would
have
taken
to
season
the
material
in
the
air
heavy
green
oak
timbers
for
wagons
and
wheels
were
dried
in
the
kiln
in
ninety
to
one
hundred
days
it
would
have
taken
two
years
to
cure
this
material
outdoors
by
their
valuable
test
work
scientists
are
devising
efficient
means
of
protecting
wood
against
decay
they
treat
the
woods
with
such
chemicals
as
creosote
zinc
chloride
and
other
preservatives
the
life
of
the
average
railroad
tie
is
at
least
doubled
by
such
treatment
we
could
save
about
one
and
billion
board
feet
of
valuable
hardwood
lumber
annually
if
all
the
untreated
railroad
ties
now
in
use
could
be
protected
in
this
manner
if
all
wood
exposed
to
decay
were
similarly
treated
we
could
save
about
six
billion
board
feet
of
timber
each
year
about
of
all
the
lumber
that
is
cut
in
the
united
states
is
used
in
making
crates
and
packing
boxes
the
majority
of
these
boxes
are
not
satisfactory
either
they
are
not
strong
enough
or
else
they
are
not
the
right
size
or
shape
during
a
recent
year
the
railroads
paid
out
more
than
to
shippers
who
lost
goods
in
transit
due
to
boxes
and
crates
that
were
damaged
in
shipment
in
order
to
find
out
what
woods
are
best
to
use
in
crates
and
boxes
and
what
sizes
and
shapes
will
withstand
rough
handling
the
laboratory
experts
developed
a
novel
drum
that
tosses
the
boxes
to
and
fro
and
gives
them
the
same
kind
of
rough
handling
they
get
on
the
railroad
this
testing
machine
has
demonstrated
that
the
proper
method
of
nailing
the
box
is
of
great
importance
tests
have
shown
that
the
weakest
wood
properly
nailed
into
a
container
is
more
serviceable
than
the
strongest
wood
poorly
nailed
better
designs
of
boxes
have
been
worked
out
which
save
lumber
and
space
and
produce
stronger
containers
educating
the
lumbering
industry
away
from
extravagant
practices
is
one
of
the
important
activities
of
the
modern
forestry
experts
operators
who
manufacture
handles
spokes
chairs
furniture
toys
and
agricultural
implements
could
by
scientific
methods
of
wood
using
produce
just
as
good
products
by
using
to
per
cent
of
the
tree
as
they
do
by
using
all
of
it
the
furniture
industry
not
infrequently
wastes
from
to
per
cent
of
the
raw
lumber
which
it
buys
much
of
this
waste
could
be
saved
by
cutting
the
small
sizes
of
material
directly
from
the
log
instead
of
from
lumber
it
is
also
essential
that
sizes
of
material
used
in
these
industries
be
standardized
the
forest
products
laboratory
has
perfected
practical
methods
of
building
up
material
from
small

which
otherwise
would
be
thrown
away
for

shoe
lasts
hat
blocks
bowling
pins
bats
wagon
bolsters
and
wheel
hubs
are
now
made
of
short
pieces
of
material
which
are
fastened
together
with
waterproof
glue
if
this
method
of
construction
can
be
made
popular
in
all
sections
of
the
country
very
great
savings
in
our
annual
consumption
of
wood
can
be
brought
about
as
matters
now
stand
approximately
per

of
the
tree
in
the
forest
is
lost
or
wasted
in
the
woods
per

at
the
mills
per
cent
in
seasoning
the
lumber
and
from
to
per
cent
in
working
the
lumber
over
into
the
manufactured
articles
this
new
method
of
construction
which
makes
full
use
of
odds
and
ends
and
slabs
and
edgings
offers
a
profitable
way
to
make
use
of
the
per
cent
of
material
which
now
is
wasted
the
vast
importance
of
preserving
our
forests
is
emphasized
when
one
stops
to
consider
the
great
number
of
uses
to
which
wood
is
put
in
addition
to
being
used
as
a
building
material
wood
is
also
manufactured
into
newspaper
and
writing
paper
furthermore
it
is
a
most
important
product
in
the
making
of
linoleum
artificial
silk
gunpowder
paints

celluloid
varnishes
sausage

chloroform
and
iodoform

alcohol

is
made
by

distillation
of

is
another
important
acetate
of
lime
which
is
used
extensively
in
chemical
plants
and
charcoal
are
other
products
which
result
from
wood
distillation
the
charcoal
makes
a
good
fuel
and
is
valuable
for
smelting
iron
tin
and
copper
in
the
manufacture
of
gunpowder
as
an
insulating
material
and
as
a
clarifier
in
sugar
refineries
it
is
predicted
that
the
future
fuel
for
use
in
automobile
engines
will
be
obtained
from
wood
waste
ethyl
or
grain
alcohol
can
now
be
made
from
sawdust
and
other
mill
refuse
one
ton
of
dry
douglas
fir
or
southern
yellow
pine
will
yield
from
twenty
to
gallons
of

alcohol
it
is
estimated
that
more
than
gallons
of
alcohol
could
be
made
annually
from

this

world
in
forest
resources
instead
they
left
barren
stretches
and
desolate
wastes
where
dense
woods
once
stood
it
is
time
that
the
present
owners
of
the
land
begin
the
reclamation
of
our
acres
of
timberlands
some
of
these
lands
still
are
yielding
fair
crops
of
timber
due
to
natural
restocking
and
proper
care
most
of
them
are
indifferent
producers
of
all
this
land
is
bare
of
forest
growth
it
is
our
duty
as
citizens
of
the
united
states
to
aid
as
we
may
in
the
reforestation
of
this
area
fires
are
cutting
down
the
size
of
our
forests
each
year
during
a
recent
period
forest
fires
burned
over
acres
an
area
as
large
as
the
state
of
utah
and
destroyed
or
damaged
timber
and
property
valued
at
year
by
year
fires
and
bad
timber
practices
have
been
increasing
our
total
areas
of
waste
and
land
we
are
facing
a
future
lumber
famine
not
alone
because
we
have
used
up
our
timber
but
also
because
we
have
failed
to
make
use
of
our
vast
acreage
of
idle
land
adapted
for
growing
forests
we
must
call
a
halt
and
begin
all
over
again
our
new
start
must
be
along
the
lines
of
timber
planting
and
tree
increase
the
landowners
the
states
and
the
federal
government
must
all
get
together
in
this
big
drive
for
reforestation
it
is
impossible
to
make
national
forests
out
of
all
the
idle
forest
land
on
the
other
hand
the
matter
of
reforestation
can
not
be
left
to
private
owners
some
of
them
would
set
out
trees
and
restore
the
forests
as
desired
others
would
not
the
public
has
large
interests
at
stake
it
must
bear
part
of
the
burden
proper
protection
of
the
forests
against
fire
can
come
only
through
united
public
action
everyone
must
do
his
part
to
reduce
the
fire
danger
the
public
must
also
bring
about
needed
changes
in
many
of
our
tax
methods
so
that
private
owners
will
be
encouraged
to
go
into
the
business
of
raising
timber
the
government
must
do
its
share
the
private
landowner
must
help
to
the
utmost
and
the
public
must
aid
in
every
possible
way
including
payment
of
higher
prices
for
lumber
as
the
cost
of
growing
timber
increases
france
and
scandinavia
have
solved
their
forest
problems
along
about
the
same
lines
the
united
states
will
have
to
follow
these
countries
keep
up
public
forests
all
the
landowners
are
taught
how
to
set
out
and
raise
trees
everyone
has
learned
to
respect
the
timberlands
the
woods
are
thought
of
as
treasures
which
must
be
carefully
handled
the
average
man
would
no
more
think
of
abusing
the
trees
in
the
forest
than
he
would
of
setting
fire
to
his
home
the
foreign
countries
are
now
busy
working
out
their
forestry
problems
of
the
years
to
come
we
in
america
are
letting
the
future
take
care
of
itself
our
states
should
aid
generally
in
the
work
of
preventing
forest
fires
they
should
pass
laws
which
will
require
more
careful
handling
of
private
forest
lands
they
should
pass
more
favorable
timber
tax
laws
so
that
tree
growing
will
be
encouraged
uncle
sam
should
be
the
director
in
charge
of
all
this
work
he
should
instruct
the
states
how
to
protect
their
forests
against
fire
he
should
teach
them
how
to
renew
their
depleted
woodlands
he
should
work
for
a
gradual
and
regular
expansion
of
the
national
forests
the
united
states
forest
service
should
have
the
power
to
help
the
various
states
in
matters
of
fire
protection
ways
of
cutting
forests
methods
of
renewing
forests
and
of
deciding
whether
idle
lands
were
better
adapted
for
farming
or
forestry
purposes
experts
believe
that
the
government
should
spend
at
least
a
year
in
the
purchase
of
new
national
forests
about
of
all
our
forests
are
now
publicly
owned
one
of
the
best
ways
of
preventing
the
concentration
of
timber
in
private
ownership
is
to
increase
the
area
of
publicly
owned
forests
such
actions
would
prevent
the
waste
of
valuable
timber
and
would
aid
planting
work
for
best
results
it
is
thought
that
the
federal
government
should
own
about
of
all
the
forests
in
the
country
to
protect
the
watersheds
of
navigable
streams
the
government
should
buy
acres
of
woodlands
in
new
england
and
acres
in
the
southern
appalachian
mountains
the
national
forests
should
also
be
extended
and
consolidated
federal
funds
should
be
increased
so
that
the
forest
service
can
undertake
on
a
large
scale
the
replanting
of
lands
in
the
national
forests
as
soon
as
this
work
is
well
under
way
congress
should
supply
about
annually
for
such
work
many
watersheds
in
the
national
forests
are
bare
of
cover
due
to
forest
fires
as
a
result
the
water
of
these
streams
is
not
sufficient
for
the
needs
of
irrigation
water
power
and
city
water
supply
of
the
surrounding
regions
right
now
even
our
leading
foresters
do
not
know
exactly
what
the
forest
resources
of
the
country
amount
to
it
will
take
several
years
to
make
such
a
survey
even
after
the
necessary
funds
are
provided
we
need
to
know
just
how
much
wood
of
each
class
and
type
is
available
we
want
to
know
in
each
case
the
present
and
possible
output
we
want
to
find
out
the
timber
requirements
of
each
state
and
of
every
important
industry
exact
figures
are
needed
on
the
timber
stands
and
their
growth
the
experimental
work
of
the
forest
service
should
be
extended
practically
every
forest
is
different
from
every
other
forest
it
is
necessary
to
work
out
locally
the
problems
of
each
timber
reservation
most
urgent
of
all
is
the
demand
for
a
law
to
allow
federal
officers
to
render
greater
assistance
to
the
state
forestry
departments
in
fighting
forest
fires
many
state
laws
designed
to
perpetuate
our
forests
must
be
passed
if
our
remaining
timber
resources
are
to
be
saved
during
times
when
fires
threaten
all
the
forest
lands
in
each
state
should
be
guarded
by
organized
agencies
this
protection
should
include
and
unimproved
land
as
well
as
timber
tracts
such
a
plan
would
require
that
the
state
and
federal
governments
bear
about
the
expenses
while
the
private
forest
owners
should
stand
the
balance
there
would
be
special
rules
regulating
the
disposal
of
slashings
methods
of
cutting
timber
and
of
extracting
forest
products
such
as
pulpwood
or
naval
stores
if
our
forests
are
to
be
saved
for
the
future
we
must
begin
conservation
at
once
to
a
small
degree
luck
plays
a
part
in
maintaining
the
size
of
the
forest
some
woodlands
in
the
south
atlantic
states
are
now
producing
their
third
cut
of
saw
logs
despite
forest
fires
and
other
destructive
agencies
these
forests
have
continued
to
produce
some
of
the
northern
timberlands
have
grown
crops
of
saw
timber
and
wood
pulp
for
from
one
hundred
fifty
to
two
hundred
fifty
years
expert
foresters
report
that
private
owners
are
each
year
increasing
their
plantings
on
denuded
woodlands
new
england
landowners
are
planting
between
and
young
forest
trees
a
year
the
middle
atlantic
and
central
states
are
doing
about
as
well
to
save
our
forests
planting
of
this
sort
must
be
universal
it
takes
from
fifty
to
one
hundred
years
to
grow
a
crop
of
merchantable
timber
what
the
united
states
needs
is
a
national
forestry
policy
which
will
induce
every
landowner
to
plant
and
grow
more
trees
on
land
that
is
not
useful
for
farm
crops
our
forestry
problem
is
to
put
to
work
millions
of
acres
of
idle
land
as
one
eminent
forester
recently
remarked
if
we
are
to
remain
a
nation
of
timber
users
we
must
become
a
nation
of
wood
growers
