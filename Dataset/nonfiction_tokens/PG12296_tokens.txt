preface
the
object
of
this
book
is
to
present
a
popular
narrative
of
the
asiatic
zoölogical
expedition
of
the
american
museum
of
natural
history
to
china
in
details
of
a
purely
scientific
nature
have
been
condensed
or
eliminated
and
emphasis
has
been
placed
upon
our
experiences
with
the
strange
natives
and
animals
of
a
remote
and
little
known
region
in
the
hope
that
the
book
will
be
interesting
to
the
general
reader
the
scientific
reputation
of
the
expedition
will
rest
upon
the
technical
reports
of
its
work
which
will
be
published
in
due
course
by
the
american
museum
of
natural
history
to
these
reports
we
would
refer
those
readers
who
desire
more
complete
information
concerning
the
results
of
our
researches
at
the
time
the
manuscript
of
this
volume
was
sent
to
press
the
collections
were
still
undergoing
preparation
and
the
study
of
the
different
groups
had
just
begun
although
the
book
has
been
largely
written
by
the
senior
author
his
collaborator
has
contributed
six
chapters
marked
with
her
initials
all
the
illustrations
are
from
her
photographs
and
continual
use
has
been
made
of
her
daily
journals
she
has
moreover
materially
assisted
in
reference
work
and
in
numerous
other
ways
the
information
concerning
the
relationships
and
distribution
of
the
native
tribes
of
is
largely
drawn
from
the
excellent
reference
work
by
major
davies
and
we
have
followed
his
spelling
of
chinese
names
parts
of
the
book
have
been
published
as
separate
articles
in
the
museum
and
and
to
the
editors
of
the
above
publications
our
acknowledgments
are
due
that
the
expedition
obtained
a
very
large
and
representative
collection
of
small
mammals
is
owing
in
a
great
measure
to
the
efforts
of
edmund
heller
our
companion
in
the
field
he
worked
tirelessly
in
the
care
and
preservation
of
the
specimens
and
the
fact
that
they
reached
new
york
in
excellent
condition
is
in
itself
the
best
testimony
to
the
skill
and
thoroughness
with
which
they
were
prepared
our
chinese
interpreter
wu
contributed
largely
to
the
success
of
the
expedition
his
faithful
and
enthusiastic
devotion
to
our
interests
and
his
tact
and
resourcefulness
under
trying
circumstances
won
our
lasting
gratitude
and
affectionate
regard
the
nineteen
months
during
which
we
were
in
asia
are
among
the
most
memorable
of
our
lives
and
we
wish
to
express
our
deepest
gratitude
to
the
trustees
of
the
american
museum
of
natural
history
and
especially
to
president
henry
fairfield
osborn
whose
enthusiastic
endorsement
and
loyal
support
made
the
expedition
possible
director
lucas
j
allen
and
george
sherwood
were
unfailing
in
furthering
our
interests
and
to
them
we
extend
our
hearty
thanks
to
the
following
patrons
who
by
their
generous
contributions
materially
assisted
in
the
financing
of
the
expedition
we
wish

i
the
object
of
the
expedition
the
earliest
remains
of
primitive
man
probably
will
be
found
somewhere
in
the
vast
plateau
of
central
asia
north
of
the
himalaya
mountains
from
this
region
came
the
successive
invasions
that
poured
into
europe
from
the
east
to
india
from
the
north
and
to
china
from
the
west
the
migration
route
to
north
america
led
over
the
bering
strait
and
spread
fanwise
south
and
southeast
to
the
farthest
extremity
of
south
america
the
central
asian
plateau
at
the
beginning
of
the
pleistocene
was
probably
less
arid
than
it
is
today
and
there
is
reason
to
believe
that
this
general
region
was
not
only
the
distributing
center
of
man
but
also
of
many
of
the
forms
of
mammalian
life
which
are
now
living
in
other
parts
of
the
world
for
instance
our
american
moose
the
wapiti
or
elk
rocky
mountain
sheep
the
mountain
goat
and
other
animals
are
probably
of
central
asian
origin
doubtless
there
were
many
contributing
causes
to
the
extensive
wanderings
of
primitive
tribes
but
as
they
were
primarily
hunters
one
of
the
most
important
must
have
been
the
movements
of
the
game
upon
which
they
lived
therefore
the
study
of
the
early
human
races
is
necessarily
closely
connected
with
and
dependent
upon
a
knowledge
of
the
central
asian
mammalian
life
and
its
distribution
no
systematic
palæontological
archæological
or
zoölogical
study
of
this
region
on
a
large
scale
has
ever
been
attempted
and
there
is
no
similar
area
of
the
inhabited
surface
of
the
earth
about
which
so
little
is
known
the
american
museum
of
natural
history
hopes
in
the
near
future
to
conduct
extensive
explorations
in
this
part
of
the
world
along
general
scientific
lines
the
country
itself
and
its
inhabitants
however
present
unusual
obstacles
to
scientific
research
not
only
is
the
region
one
of
vast
intersecting
mountain
ranges
the
greatest
of
the
earth
but
the
climate
is
too
cold
in
winter
to
permit
of
continuous
work
the
people
have
a
natural
dislike
for
foreigners
and
the
political
events
of
the
last
half
century
have
not
tended
to
decrease
their
suspicions
it
is
possible
to
overcome
such
difficulties
but
the
plans
for
extensive
research
must
be
carefully
prepared
one
of
the
most
important
steps
is
the
sending
out
of
preliminary
expeditions
to
gain
a
general
knowledge
of
the
natives
and
fauna
and
of
the
conditions
to
be
encountered
for
the
first
reconnaissance
which
was
intended
to
be
largely
a
mammalian
survey
the
asiatic
zoölogical
expedition
left
new
york
in
march
its
destination
was
a
province
in
southwestern
china
this
is
one
of
the
least
known
parts
of
the
chinese
republic
and
because
of
its
southern
latitude
and
high
mountain
systems
the
climate
and
faunal
range
is
very
great
it
is
about
equal
in
size
to
the
state
of
california
and
topographically
might
be
likened
to
the
ocean
in
a
furious
gale
for
the
greater
part
of
its
surface
has
been
thrown
into
vast
mountain
waves
which
divide
and
cross
one
another
in
hopeless
confusion
is
bordered
on
the
north
by
tibet
and
on
the
west
by
burma
on
the
south
by
tonking
and
on
the
east
by
province
faunistically
the
entire
northwestern
part
of
is
essentially
tibetan
and
the
plateaus
and
mountain
peaks
range
from
altitudes
of
feet
to
feet
above
sea
level
in
the
south
and
west
along
the
borders
of
burma
and
tonking
in
the
low
valleys
the
climate
is
that
of
the
and
the
native
life
as
well
as
the
fauna
and
flora
is
of
a
totally
different
type
from
that
found
in
the
north
the
natives
of
are
exceptionally
interesting
there
are
about
thirty
tribes
in
the
province
some
of
whom
such
as
the
shans
and
lolos
represent
the
aboriginal
inhabitants
of
china
and
it
is
safe
to
say
that
in
no
similar
area
of
the
world
is
there
such
a
variety
of
language
and
dialects
as
in
this
region
although
the
main
work
of
the
expedition
was
to
be
conducted
in
we
decided
to
spend
a
short
time
in
fukien
province
china
and
endeavor
to
obtain
a
specimen
of
the
blue
tiger
which
has
been
seen
twice
by
the
reverend
harry
caldwell
a
missionary
and
amateur
naturalist
who
has
done
much
hunting
in
the
vicinity
of
foochow
the
white
members
of
the
first
asiatic
zoölogical
expedition
included
edmund
heller
my
wife
yvette
borup
andrews
and
myself
a
chinese
interpreter
wu
with
five
native
assistants
and
ten
muleteers
completed
the
personnel
heller
is
a
collector
of
wide
experience
his
early
work
which
was
done
in
the
western
united
states
and
the
galapagos
islands
was
followed
by
many
years
of
collecting
in
mexico
alaska
south
america
and
africa
he
first
visited
british
east
africa
with
carl
akeley
next
with
theodore
roosevelt
and
again
with
paul
rainey
during
the
asiatic
zoölogical
expedition
heller
devoted
most
of
his
time
to
the
gathering
and
preparation
of
small
mammals
he
joined
our
party
late
in
july
in
china
andrews
was
the
photographer
of
the
expedition
she
had
studied
photography
as
an
amateur
in
germany
france
and
italy
as
well
as
in
new
york
and
had
devoted
especial
attention
to
the
taking
of
photographs
in
natural
colors
such
work
requires
infinite
care
and
patience
but
the
results
are
well
worth
the
efforts
expended
wu
is
a
native
of
foochow
china
and
studied
english
at
the
college
in
that
city
he
lived
for
some
time
in
in
the
employ
of
carey
commissioner
of
customs
and
not
only
speaks
mandarin
chinese
but
also
several
native
dialects
he
acted
as
interpreter
head
boy
and
general
field
manager
my
own
work
was
devoted
mainly
to
the
direction
of
the
expedition
and
the
hunting
of
big
game

and
a

in
order
to
reduce
the
heavy
transportation
charges
we
purchased
only
such
equipment
in
new
york
as
could
not
be
obtained
in
shanghai
or
hongkong
shoverling
daly
gales
furnished
our
guns
ammunition
tents
and
general
camp
equipment
and
gave
excellent
satisfaction
in
attention
to
the
minor
details
which
often
assume
alarming
importance
when
an
expedition
is
in
the
field
and
defects
can
not
be
remedied
all
food
and
commissary
supplies
were
purchased
in
hongkong
chapter
ix
when
the
announcement
of
the
expedition
was
made
by
the
american
museum
of
natural
history
it
received
wide
publicity
in
america
and
other
parts
of
the
world
immediately
we
began
to
discover
how
many
strange
persons
make
up
the
great
cities
of
the
united
states
and
we
received
letters
and
telegrams
from
hundreds
of
people
who
wished
to
take
part
in
the
expedition
men
and
boys
were
the
principal
applicants
but
there
was
no
lack
of
women
many
of
whom
came
to
the
museum
for
personal
interviews
most
of
the
letters
were
laughable
in
the
extreme
one
was
from
a
butcher
who
thought
he
might
be
of
great
assistance
in
preparing
our
specimens
or
defending
us
from
savage
natives
another
young
man
offered
himself
to
my
wife
as
a
personal
bodyguard
a
third
was
sure
his
twenty
years
experience
as
a
waiter
would
fit
him
for
an
important
position
on
the
expedition
and
numerous
women
young
and
old
wished
to
become
companions
for
my
wife
in
those
drear
wastes
applicants
continued
to
besiege
us
wherever
we
stopped
on
our
way
across
the
continent
and
in
san
francisco
until
we
embarked
on
the
afternoon
of
mardi
on
the
for
japan
our
way
across
the
pacific
was
uneventful
and
as
the
great
vessel
drew
in
toward
the
wharf
in
yokohama
she
was
boarded
by
the
usual
crowd
of
natives
we
were
standing
at
the
rail
when
three
japanese
approached
and
bowing
in
unison
said
we
are
report
for
leading
japanese
newspaper
we
wish
to
know
all
thing
about
chinese
animal
evidently
the
speech
had
been
rehearsed
for
with
it
their
english
ended
abruptly
and
the
interview
proceeded
rather
lamely
on
my
part
in
japanese
japan
was
reveling
in
the
cherry
blossom
season
when
we
arrived
and
for
a
person
interested
in
color
photography
it
was
a
veritable
paradise
we
stayed
three
weeks
and
regretfully
left
for
peking
by
way
of
korea
but
before
we
continue
with
the
story
of
our
further
travels
we
would
like
briefly
to
review
the
political
situation
in
china
as
a
background
for
our
early
work
in
the
province
of
fukien
chapter
ii
china
in
turmoil
during
the
time
the
expedition
was
preparing
to
leave
new
york
china
was
in
turmoil
yuan
was
president
of
the
republic
but
the
hope
of
his
heart
was
to
be
emperor
of
china
for
twenty
years
he
had
plotted
for
the
throne
he
had
been
emperor
for
one
hundred
miserable
days
and
now
he
was
watching
impotently
his
crumble
beneath
his
feet
yuan
was
the
strong
man
of
his
day
with
more
power
brains
and
personality
than
any
chinese
since
chang
he
always
had
been
a
factor
in
his
political
world
his
monarchical
dream
first
took
definite
form
as
early
as
when
he
became
viceroy
of
the
province
in
which
peking
is
situated
it
was
then
that
he
began
to
modernize
and
get
control
of
the
army
which
is
the
great
basis
of
political
power
in
china
properly
speaking
there
was
not
and
is
not
now
a
chinese
national
army
it
is
rather
a
collection
of
armies
each
giving
loyalty
to
a
certain
general
and
he
who
secures
the
support
of
the
various
commanders
controls
the
destiny
of
china
four
hundred
millions
of
people
regardless
of
his
official
title
yuan
was
able
to
bind
to
himself
the
majority
of
the
leading
generals
and
in
when
the
manchu
dynasty
was
overthrown
his
plots
and
intrigues
began
to
bear
fruit
by
crafty
juggling
of
the
rebels
and
manchus
he
managed
to
get
himself
elected
president
of
the
new
republic
although
he
did
not
for
a
moment
believe
in
the
republican
form
of
government
he
was
always
a
monarchist
at
heart
but
was
perfectly
willing
to
declare
himself
an
ardent
republican
so
long
as
such
a
declaration
could
be
used
as
a
stepping
stone
to
the
throne
which
he
kept
ever
as
his
ultimate
goal
as
president
he
ruled
with
a
high
hand
in
there
was
a
rebellion
in
protest
against
his
official
acts
but
he
defeated
the
rebels
won
over
more
of
the
older
generals
and
solidified
the
army
for
his
own
interests
making
himself
stronger
than
ever
before
at
this
time
he
might
well
have
made
a
and
proclaimed
himself
emperor
with
hardly
a
shadow
of
resistance
but
with
the
hereditary
caution
of
the
chinese
he
preferred
to
wait
and
plot
and
scheme
he
wanted
his
position
to
be
even
more
secure
and
to
have
it
appear
that
he
reluctantly
accepted
the
throne
as
a
patriotic
duty
at
the
insistent
call
of
the
people
yuan
ways
for
producing
the
proper
public
sentiment
were
typically
chinese
but
entirely
effective
and
he
was
making
splendid
progress
when
in
may
japan
put
a
spoke
in
his
wheel
of
fortune
by
taking
advantage
of
the
european
war
and
presenting
the
historical
demands
to
most
of
which
china
agreed
this
delayed
his
plans
only
temporarily
and
yuan
agents
pushed
the
work
of
making
him
emperor
more
actively
than
ever
with
the
result
that
the
throne
was
tendered
to
him
by
the
unanimous
vote
of
the
people
to
save
his
face
he
declined
at
first
but
at
the
second
offer
he
reluctantly
yielded
and
on
december
became
emperor
of
china
but
his
triumph
was
for
eight
days
later
tidings
of
unrest
in
reached
peking
general
a
former
military
governor
of
the
province
appeared
in
fu
the
capital
and
on
december
sent
an
ultimatum
to
yuan
stating
that
he
must
repudiate
the
monarchy
and
execute
all
those
who
had
assisted
him
to
gain
the
throne
otherwise
would
secede
which
it
forthwith
did
on
december
without
doubt
this
rebellion
was
financed
by
the
japanese
who
had
intimated
to
yuan
that
the
change
from
a
republican
form
of
government
would
not
meet
with
their
approval
the
rebellion
spread
rapidly
on
january
province
which
adjoins
seceded
and
on
march
also
announced
its
independence
about
this
time
the
museum
authorities
were
becoming
somewhat
doubtful
as
to
the
advisability
of
proceeding
with
our
expedition
we
had
a
long
talk
with
wellington
koo
the
chinese
minister
to
the
united
states
at
the
biltmore
hotel
in
new
york
koo
while
certain
that
the
rebellion
would
be
strongly
advised
us
to
postpone
our
expedition
until
conditions
became
more
settled
he
offered
to
cable
peking
for
advice
but
we
knowing
how
unwelcome
to
the
government
of
the
harassed
yuan
would
be
a
party
of
foreigners
who
wished
to
travel
in
the
disturbed
area
gratefully
declined
and
determined
to
proceed
regardless
of
conditions
we
hoped
that
yuan
would
be
strong
enough
to
crush
this
rebellion
as
he
had
that
of
but
day
by
day
as
we
anxiously
watched
the
papers
there
came
reports
of
other
provinces
dropping
away
from
his
standard
on
the
we
met
the
honorable
charles
denby
an
at
shanghai
and
former
adviser
to
yuan
when
he
was
viceroy
of
denby
was
interested
in
obtaining
a
road
concession
near
peking
and
was
then
on
his
way
to
see
yuan
his
anxiety
over
the
political
situation
was
not
less
than
ours
and
together
we
often
paced
the
decks
discussing
what
might
happen
but
every
wireless
report
told
of
more
desertions
to
the
ranks
of
the
rebels
it
seemed
to
be
the
beginning
of
the
end
for
yuan
had
lost
his
nerve
he
had
decided
to
quit
and
one
hundred
days
after
he
became
emperor
elect
he
issued
a
mandate
canceling
the
monarchy
and
restoring
the
republic
but
the
rebellious
provinces
were
not
satisfied
and
demanded
that
he
get
out
altogether
about
this
time
we
reached
peking
literally
blown
in
by
a
tremendous
dust
storm
which
seemed
an
elemental
manifestation
of
the
human
turmoil
within
the
grim
old
walls
our
cousin
commander
thomas
hutchins
naval
attaché
of
the
american
legation
was
awaiting
us
on
the
platform
holding
his
hat
with
one
hand
and
wiping
the
dust
from
his
eyes
with
the
other
the
news
we
received
from
him
was
by
no
means
comforting
for
in
the
legation
pessimism
reigned
supreme
the
american
minister
reinsch
was
not
enthusiastic
about
our
going
south
regardless
of
conditions
but
nevertheless
he
set
about
helping
us
to
obtain
the
necessary
visé
for
our
passports
we
wished
first
to
go
to
foochow
in
fukien
province
where
we
were
to
hunt
tiger
until
heller
joined
us
in
july
for
the
expedition
into
fukien
was
still
loyal
to
yuan
but
the
strong
japanese
influence
in
this
province
which
is
directly
opposite
the
island
of
formosa
was
causing
considerable
uneasiness
in
peking
we
were
armed
with
telegrams
from
kellogg
of
the
college
with
whom
we
were
to
stay
while
in
foochow
assuring
us
that
all
was
quiet
in
the
province
and
through
the
influence
of
reinsch
the
chinese
foreign
office
viséd
our
passports
the
huge
red
stamp
which
was
affixed
to
them
was
an
amusing
example
of
chinese
face
saving
first
came
the
seal
of
impotent
dynasty
of
signifying
brilliant
prosperity
and
directly
upon
it
was
placed
the
stamp
of
the
chinese
republic
one
was
almost
as
legible
as
the
other
and
thus
the
foreign
office
saved
its
face
in
whichever
direction
the
shifting
cards
of
political
destiny
should
fall
at
a
luncheon
given
by
reinsch
at
the
embassy
in
peking
we
met
admiral
von
hintze
the
german
minister
who
had
recently
completed
an
adventurous
trip
from
germany
to
china
he
was
minister
to
mexico
at
the
beginning
of
the
war
but
had
returned
to
berlin
incognito
through
england
to
ask
the
kaiser
for
active
sea
service
the
emperor
was
greatly
elated
over
von
hintze
performance
and
offered
him
the
appointment
of
minister
to
china
if
he
could
reach
peking
in
the
same
way
that
he
had
traveled
to
berlin
von
hintze
therefore
shipped
as
supercargo
on
a
scandinavian
tramp
steamer
and
arrived
safely
at
shanghai
where
he
assumed
all
the
pomp
of
a
foreign
diplomat
and
proceeded
to
the
capital
the
americans
were
in
a
rather
difficult
position
at
this
time
because
of
the
international
complications
and
social
intercourse
was
extremely
limited
dinner
guests
had
to
be
chosen
with
the
greatest
care
and
one
was
very
likely
to
meet
exactly
the
same
people
wherever
one
went
peking
is
a
place
never
to
be
forgotten
by
one
who
has
shared
its
social
life
in
the
midst
of
one
of
the
most
picturesque
most
historical
and
most
romantic
cities
of
the
world
there
is
a
cosmopolitan
community
that
enjoys
itself
to
the
utmost
its
talk
is
all
of
horses
polo
racing
shooting
dinners
and
dances
with
the
interesting
background
of
chinese
politics
in
which
things
are
never
dull
there
is
always
a
rebellion
of
some
kind
to
furnish
delightful
thrills
and
one
never
can
tell
when
a
new
political
bomb
will
be
projected
from
the
mysterious
gates
of
the
forbidden
city
we
spent
a
week
in
peking
and
regretfully
left
by
rail
for
shanghai
we
passed
through
where
the
previous
night
serious
fighting
had
occurred
in
which
japanese
soldiers
had
joined
with
the
rebels
against
yuan
troops
on
every
side
there
was
evidence
of
japan
efforts
against
him
in
the
foreign
quarter
of
shanghai
just
behind
the
residence
of
sammons
the
american
one
of
yuan
leading
officers
had
been
openly
murdered
and
japanese
were
directly
concerned
in
the
plot
we
were
told
that
it
was
very
difficult
at
that
time
to
lease
houses
in
the
foreign
concession
because
wealthy
chinese
who
feared
the
wrath
of
one
party
or
the
other
were
eager
to
pay
almost
any
rent
to
obtain
the
protection
of
that
quarter
of
the
city
a
short
time
later
it
became
known
to
a
few
that
yuan
was
seriously
ill
he
was
suffering
from
bright
disease
with
its
consequent
weakness
loss
of
mental
alertness
and
lack
of
concentration
french
doctors
were
called
in
but
yuan
wives
insisted
upon
treating
him
with
concoctions
of
their
own
and
on
june
shortly
after
three
in
the
morning
he
died
even
on
his
yuan
endeavored
to
save
his
face
before
the
country
and
his
last
words
were
a
reiteration
of
what
he
knew
no
one
believed
the
story
of
his
death
is
told
in
the
china
press
of
june
according
to
news
from
the
president
palace
the
condition
of
yuan
became
critical
at
three
in
the
morning
yuan
asked
for
his
old
confidential
friend
hsu
who
came
immediately
on
the

chapter
iii
up
the
min
river
three
days
after
leaving
shanghai
we
arrived
at
pagoda
anchorage
at
the
mouth
of
the
min
river
twelve
miles
from
foochow
we
boarded
a
launch
which
threaded
its
way
through
a
fleet
of
picturesque
fishing
vessels
each
one
of
which
had
a
round
black
and
white
eye
painted
on
its
bow
when
asked
the
reason
for
this
decoration
a
chinese
on
the
launch
looked
at
us
rather
pityingly
for
a
moment
and
then
said
no
have
eye
no
can
see
how
simple
and
how
entirely
satisfactory
the
instant
the
launch
touched
the
shore
dozens
of
coolies
swarmed
like
flies
over
it
fighting
madly
for
our
luggage
one
seized
a
trunk
the
other
end
of
which
had
been
appropriated
by
another
man
and
in
the
argument
which
ensued
each
endeavored
to
deafen
the
other
by
his
screams
the
habit
of
yelling
to
enforce
command
is
inherent
with
the
chinese
and
appears
to
be
ineradicable
to
expostulate
in
an
ordinary
tone
of
voice
pausing
to
listen
to
his
opponent
reply
seems
a
psychological
impossibility
there
had
been
a
mistake
about
the
date
of
our
arrival
at
foochow
and
we
were
two
days
earlier
than
we
had
been
expected
so
that
kellogg
of
the
college
with
whom
we
were
to
stay
was
not
on
the
jetty
to
meet
us
we
were
at
a
loss
to
know
where
to
turn
amidst
the
chaos
and
confusion
until
a
customs
officer
took
us
in
charge
and
judiciously
selecting
a
competent
looking
woman
from
among
the
screaming
multitude
told
her
to
get
two
sedan
chairs
and
coolies
to
carry
our
luggage
she
disappeared
and
ten
minutes
later
the
chairs
arrived
dashing
about
among
the
crowd
in
front
of
us
she
chose
the
baggage
for
such
men
as
met
with
her
approval
and
after
the
usual
amount
of
argument
the
loads
were
taken
we
mounted
our
chairs
and
started
off
with
apparently
all
foochow
following
us
as
far
as
we
could
see
down
the
narrow
street
were
the
heads
and
shoulders
of
our
porters
we
felt
as
if
we
were
heading
an
invading
army
as
with
our
coolies
and
sixteen
hundred
pounds
of
luggage
we
descended
upon
the
homes
of
people
whom
we
did
not
know
and
who
were
not
expecting
us
but
our
sudden
arrival
did
not
disturb
the
kelloggs
and
our
welcome
was
typical
of
the
warm
hospitality
one
always
finds
in
the
far
east
no
matter
how
long
one
has
lived
in
china
one
remains
in
a
condition
of
mental
suspense
unable
to
decide
which
is
the
filthiest
city
of
the
republic
the
residents
of
foochow
boast
that
for
offensiveness
to
the
senses
no
town
can
compare
with
theirs
and
although
amoy
and
several
other
places
dispute
this
questionable
title
we
were
inclined
to
grant
it
unreservedly
to
foochow
it
is
like
a
medieval
city
with
its
narrow
streets
wandering
aimlessly
in
a
hopeless
maze
they
are
usually
roofed
over
so
that
by
no
accident
can
a
ray
of
purifying
sun
penetrate
their
dark
comers
with
no
ventilation
whatsoever
the
oppressive
air
reeks
with
the
odors
that
rise
from
the
streets
and
the
steaming
houses
in
foochow
as
in
other
cities
of
china
the
narrow
alleys
are
literally
choked
with
every
form
of
industrial
obstruction
countless
workmen
plant
themselves
in
the
tiny
passageways
with
the
pigs
children
and
dogs
and
women
bring
their
quilts
to
spread
upon
the
stones
there
is
a
common
saying
that
the
chinese
do
little
which
is
not
at
some
time
done
on
the
street
the
foreign
residents
including
consuls
of
all
nationalities
missionaries
and
merchants
live
well
out
of
the
city
on
a
hilltop
their
houses
are
built
with
very
high
ceilings
and
bare
interiors
and
as
the
occupants
seldom
go
into
the
city
except
in
a
sedan
chair
and
have
punkahs
waving
day
and
night
life
is
made
possible
during
the
intense
heat
of
summer
a
telegram
was
awaiting
us
from
the
reverend
harry
caldwell
with
whom
we
were
to
hunt
asking
us
to
come
to
his
station
two
hundred
miles
up
the
river
and
we
passed
two
sweltering
days
repacking
our
outfit
while
kellogg
scoured
the
country
for
an
cook
one
gentleman
presented
himself
but
when
he
learned
that
we
were
going
up
country
he
shook
his
head
with
an
assumption
of
great
filial
devotion
and
said
that
he
did
not
think
his
mother
would
let
him
go
another
was
afraid
the
sun
might
be
too
hot
finally
on
the
eve
of
our
departure
we
engaged
a
stuttering
chinese
who
assured
us
that
he
was
a
remarkable
cook
and
exceptionally
honest
if
you
have
never
heard
a
chinaman
stutter
you
have
something
to
live
for
and
although
we
discovered
that
our
cook
was
a
shameless
rascal
he
was
worth
all
he
extracted
in
squeeze
for
whenever
he
attempted
to
utter
a
word
we
became
almost
hysterical
he
sounded
exactly
like
a
phonograph
record
buzzing
on
a
single
note
and
when
he
finally
did
manage
to
articulate
his
pidgin
english
in
itself
was
screamingly
funny
one
day
he
came
to
the
proudly
displaying
a
piece
of
beef
and
after
a
series
of
vocal
gymnastics
eventually
succeeded
in
shouting
missie
this
meat
no
belong
not
so
handsome
which
meant
that
this
particular
piece
of
beef
was
not
from
an
animal
which
had
died
from
disease
the
first
stage
of
our
trip
began
before
daylight
we
rode
in
sedan
chairs
followed
by
a
long
procession
of
heavily
laden
coolies
with
our
cameras
and
pack
baskets
the
road
lay
through
green
rice
fields
between
terraced
mountains
and
we
jogged
along
first
on
the
crest
of
a
hill
then
in
the
valley
passing
dilapidated
temples
with
the
paint
flaking
off
and
picturesque
little
huts
half
hidden
in
the
reeds
of
the
winding
river
it
was
a
relief
to
get
into
the
country
again
after
passing
down
the
narrow
village
streets
and
to
breathe
fresh
air
perfumed
with
honeysuckle
a
passenger
launch
makes
the
trip
to
at
the
beginning
of
the
rapids
but
it
leaves
at
two
in
the
morning
and
is
literally
crowded
to
overflowing
with
chinese
who
sprawl
over
every
available
inch
of
deck
space
so
that
even
the
missionaries
strongly
advised
us
against
taking
it
the
passengers
not
infrequently
are
pushed
off
into
the
water
one
of
the
missionaries
witnessed
an
incident
which
illustrates
in
a
typical
way
the
total
lack
of
sympathy
of
the
average
chinese
a
coolie
on
the
launch
accidentally
fell
overboard
and
although
a
friend
was
able
to
grasp
his
hand
and
hold
him
above
the
surface
no
one
offered
to
help
him
the
launch
continued
at
full
speed
and
finally
weakening
the
poor
man
loosed
his
hold
and
sank
this
is
by
no
means
an
isolated
case
some
years
ago
a
foreign
steamer
was
burned
on
the
yangtze
river
and
the
crowds
of
watching
chinese
did
little
or
nothing
to
rescue
the
passengers
and
crew
indeed
as
fast
as
they
made
their
way
to
shore
many
of
them
were
robbed
even
of
their
clothing
and
some
were
murdered
outright
our
first
day
on
the
min
river
was
the
most
luxurious
of
the
entire
expedition
for
we
were
fortunate
in
obtaining
the
standard
oil
company
launch
through
the
kindness
of
livingstone
their
agent
it
was
large
and
roomy
and
the
trip
which
would
have
been
worse
than
disagreeable
on
the
public
boat
was
most
delightful
the
min
is
one
of
the
most
beautiful
rivers
of
all
china
with
its
velvet
green
mountains
rising
a
thousand
feet
or
more
straight
up
from
the
water
and
often
terraced
to
the
summits
perched
on
the
bow
of
our
boat
was
a
wizened
little
gentleman
with
a
pigtail
wrapped
around
his
head
who
said
he
was
a
pilot
but
as
he
inquired
the
channel
of
everyone
who
passed
and
ran
us
aground
a
dozen
times
or
more
to
the
tremendous
agitation
of
our
captain
we
felt
that
his
claim
was
not
entirely
justified
the
river
life
was
a
fascinating
picture
one
moment
we
would
pass
a
so
loaded
with
branches
that
it
seemed
like
a
small
island
floating
down
the
stream
next
a
huge
junk
with
sails
projecting
at
impossible
angles
drifted
by
followed
by
innumerable
smaller
crafts
the
monotonous
chant
of
the
boatmen
coming
faintly
over
the
water
to
us
as
they
passed
when
evening
came
we
had
reached
the
in
which
we
were
to
spend
eight
days
were
drawn
up
on
the
beach
with
twenty
or
thirty
others
right
above
us
was
the
straggling
town
looking
very
much
like
the
rear
view
of
tenement
houses
at
home
darkness
blotted
out
the
filth
of
our
surroundings
but
could
do
nothing
to
lessen
the
odors
that
poured
down
from
the
village
and
we
ate
our
dinner
with
little
relish
our
beds
were
spread
in
the
which
we
shared
in
common
with
the
four
river
men
who
formed
the
crew
there
was
only
a
mosquito
net
to
screen
the
end
of
the
boat
but
all
our
surroundings
were
so
strange
that
this
was
but
a
minor
detail
as
we
lay
in
our
cots
we
could
look
up
at
the
stars
framed
in
the
half
oval
of
the
roof
and
listen
to
the
sounds
of
the
water
life
grow
fainter
and
fainter
as
one
by
one
the
river
men
beached
their
boats
for
the
night
it
seemed
only
a
few
minutes
later
when
we
were
roused
by
a
rush
of
water
but
it
was
daylight
and
the
boats
had
reached
the
first
of
the
rapids
which
separated
us
from
one
hundred
and
twenty
miles
away
in
the
late
afternoon
we
arrived
at
where
caldwell
stood
on
the
shore
waving
his
hat
to
us
amidst
scores
of
dirty
little
children
and
the
explosion
of
countless
firecrackers
wherever
we
went
crackers
preceded
and
followed
us
for
when
a
chinese
wishes
to
register
extreme
emotion
either
of
joy
or
sorrow
its
expression
always
takes
the
form
of
firecrackers
there
had
been
a
good
deal
of
persecution
of
the
native
christians
in
the
district
and
only
recently
a
band
of
soldiers
had
strung
up
the
native
pastor
by
the
thumbs
and
beaten
him
senseless
he
was
our
host
that
night
and
seemed
to
be
a
bright
vivacious
little
man
but
quite
deaf
as
a
result
of
his
cruel
treatment
he
never
recovered
and
died
a
few
weeks
later
caldwell
had
come
to
investigate
the
affair
for
the
missionaries
are
invested
by
the
people
themselves
with
a
good
deal
of
authority
we
spent
that
night
in
the
parish
house
just
behind
the
little
church
a
bare
schoolroom
being
turned
over
to
us
for
our
use
and
it
seemed
very
luxurious
after
we
had
set
up
our
cots
tables
chairs
and
bath
tub
but
the
house
was
in
the
center
of
the
town
and
the
high
walls
shut
out
every
breath
of
pure
air
the
barred
windows
opened
on
a
street
hardly
six
feet
wide
and
while
we
were
preparing
for
bed
there
was
a
buzz
of
subdued
whispers
outside
we
switched
on
a
powerful
electric
flashlight
and
there
stood
at
least
forty
men
women
and
children
gazing
at
us
with
rapt
attention
but
they
melted
away
before
the
blinding
glare
like
snow
in
a
june
sun
that
night
was
not
a
pleasant
one
the
heat
was
intense
the
mosquitoes
worse
and
every
dog
and
cat
in
the
village
seemed
to
choose
our
court
yard
as
a
dueling
ground
in
which
to
settle
old
scores
the
climax
was
reached
at
four
in
the
morning
when
directly
under
our
windows
there
came
a
series
of
squeals
followed
by
a
horrible
gurgle
the
neighbors
had
chosen
that
particular
spot
and
how
to
kill
the
family
pig
and
the
entire
process
which
followed
of
sousing
it
in
hot
water
and
scraping
off
the
hair
was
accompanied
by
unceasing
chatter
boiling
with
rage
we
dressed
and
went
for
a
walk
vowing
not
to
spend
another
night
in
the
place
but
to
sleep
in
the
on
the
whole
our
river
men
were
nice
fellows
but
they
had
the
love
of
companionship
characteristic
of
all
chinese
and
the
inherent
desire
to
huddle
together
as
closely
as
possible
wherever
they
were
on
the
way
up
the
river
to
yuchi
every
evening
they
insisted
on
stopping
at
some
village
and
it
was
difficult
to
induce
them
to
spend
the
night
away
from
a
town
moreover
at
our
stops
for
luncheon
they
would
invariably
ignore
a
shady
spot
and
choose
a
sand
bank
where
the
sun
beat
down
like
a
blast
furnace
the
chinese
never
appear
to
be
affected
by
the
sun
and
go
bareheaded
at
all
seasons
of
the
year
shading
their
eyes
with
one
hand
or
a
partly
opened
fan
a
fan
is
the
prime
requisite
and
it
is
not
uncommon
to
see
coolies
almost
devoid
of
clothing
dragging
a
heavy
load
and
with
the
perspiration
streaming
from
their
naked
bodies
energetically
fanning
themselves
meanwhile
caldwell
was
to
yuchi
one
of
his
mission
stations
far
up
a
branch
of
the
min
river
and
as
there
was
a
vague
report
of
tiger
in
that
vicinity
we
joined
him
instead
of
proceeding
directly
to
the
tiger
story
was
found
to
be
merely
a
myth
but
our
trip
was
made
interesting
by
meeting
miss
mabel
hartford
the
only
foreign
resident
of
the
place
she
has
lived
in
yuchi
for
two
years
and
at
one
time
did
not
see
a
white
person
for
eight
months
with
the
exception
of
caldwell
who
was
in
the
vicinity
for
three
days
it
requires
four
weeks
to
obtain
supplies
from
foochow
there
is
no
telegraph
and
mails
are
very
irregular
but
she
enjoys
the
isolation
and
is
passionately
fond
of
her
work
she
has
had
an
interesting
life
and
one
not
devoid
of
danger
in
she
was
wounded
and
barely
escaped
death
in
the
hwa
shan
flower
mountain
massacre
in
which
ten
women
and
one
man
were
brutally
murdered
by
a
mob
of
fanatic
natives
known
as
vegetarians
the
chinese
government
was
required
to
pay
a
considerable
indemnity
to
miss
hartford
which
she
accepted
only
under
protest
and
characteristically
devoted
to
missionary
work
in
kucheng
where
the
massacre
occurred
conditions
at
yuchi
when
we
arrived
were
most
unsettled
and
for
some
months
there
had
been
a
veritable
reign
of
terror
a
large
band
of
brigands
was
established
in
the
hills
not
far
from
the
city
and
we
were
warned
by
the
mandarin
not
to
attempt
to
go
farther
up
the
river
a
few
months
earlier
several
companies
of
soldiers
had
been
sent
from
foochow
and
the
result
of
turning
loose
these
ruffians
upon
the
town
was
to
make
the
remedy
worse
than
the
disease
the
soldiers
were
continually
arresting
innocent
peasants
accusing
them
of
being
brigands
or
aiding
the
bandits
and
shooting
them
without
a
hearing
at
one
time
accurate
information
concerning
the
camp
of
the
robbers
was
received
and
the
soldiers
set
bravely
off
but
when
within
a
short
distance
of
the
brigands
the
commanders
began
to
quarrel
among
themselves
guns
were
fired
and
the
bandits
escaped
a
chinaman
must
always
save
his
face
however
and
when
they
returned
to
yuchi
they
arrested
dozens
of
people
on
mere
suspicion
and
executed
them
without
the
vestige
of
a
trial
finally
conditions
became
so
intolerable
that
no
one
was
safe
and
after
repeated
complaints
by
the
missionaries
a
new
mandarin
of
a
somewhat
better
type
was
sent
to
yuchi
as
it
was
impossible
to
do
any
collecting
farther
up
the
river
because
of
the
bandits
we
left
for
two
days
after
arriving
at
yuchi
is
a
wonderfully
picturesque
old
city
situated
on
a
hill
at
a
fork
of
the
river
and
surrounded
by
high
stone
walls
pierced
and
loopholed
for
rifle
fire
such
walls
while
of
little
use
against
artillery
nevertheless
offer
a
formidable
obstacle
to
anything
less
than
field
guns
as
we
ourselves
were
destined
to
discover
the
methodist
mission
compound
encloses
a
considerable
area
on
the
very
summit
of
the
hill
backed
by
the
city
wall
and
besides
the
four
dwelling
houses
comprises
two
large
schools
for
boys
and
girls
caldwell
residence
commands
a
wonderful
view
down
the
river
and
in
the
late
afternoon
sunlight
when
the
hills
are
bathed
in
pink
and
lavender
and
purple
a
more
beautiful
spot
can
hardly
be
imagined
but
the
delights
of
are
somewhat
tempered
by
the
abominable
weather
in
summer
the
heat
is
almost
unbearable
and
the
air
is
so
nearly
saturated
from
continual
rain
that
it
is
impossible
to
dry
anything
except
over
a
fire
from
all
reports
winter
must
be
almost
as
bad
in
the
opposite
extreme
for
the
cold
is
damp
and
penetrating
but
the
early
fall
is
said
to
be
delightful
the
larger
part
of
fukien
like
many
other
provinces
in
china
has
been
denuded
of
forests
and
the
groves
of
pine
which
remain
have
all
been
planted
this
deforestation
consequently
has
driven
out
the
game
and
except
for
tigers
leopards
wolves
wild
pigs
serows
and
gorals
none
of
the
large
species
is
left
however
the
dense
growth
of
sword
grass
and
the
thorny
bushes
which
clothe
the
hills
and
choke
the
ravines
give
cover
to
muntjac
or
barking
deer
and
many
species
of
small
cats
civets
and
other
viverines
these
animals
come
to
the
rice
paddys
which
fill
every
valley
to
hunt
for
frogs
and
fish
but
it
is
difficult
to
catch
them
because
of
the
chinese
who
are
continually
at
work
in
the
fields
we
spent
a
week
trapping
about
and
although
we
caught
a
good
many
animals
they
were
almost
always
stolen
together
with
the
traps
we
had
this
same
difficulty
in
as
well
as
in
fukien
none
of
us
had
ever
seen
natives
in
any
part
of
the
world
who
were
such
unmitigated
thieves
as
the
chinese
of
these
two
provinces
the
small
mammals
are
hardly
more
abundant
than
the
larger
ones
for
the
natives
wage
an
unceasing
war
on
those
about
the
rice
paddys
and
have
exterminated
nearly
all
but
a
few
widely
distributed
forms
chapter
iv
a
bat
cave
in
the
big
ravine
a
few
days
after
our
arrival
in
we
went
with
caldwell
and
his
son
oliver
to
a
taoist
temple
seven
miles
away
in
a
lonely
ravine
known
as
the
walk
to
the
temple
in
the
early
morning
was
delightful
the
bamboo
chickens
and
francolins
were
calling
all
about
us
and
on
the
way
we
shot
enough
for
our
first
day
dinner
both
these
birds
are
abundant
in
fukien
province
but
it
is
by
no
means
easy
to
kill
them
for
they
live
in
such
thick
cover
that
they
can
only
be
flushed
with
difficulty
early
in
the
morning
we
frequently
heard
the
francolins
crowing
in
the
trees
or
on
the
top
of
a
hill
and
when
a
cock
had
taken
possession
of
such
a
spot
the
intrusion
of
another
was
almost
sure
to
cause
trouble
which
only
ended
when
one
of
them
had
been
driven
off
for
two
miles
and
a
half
the
big
ravine
is
a
narrow
cut
between
perpendicular
rock
walls
thickly
clothed
to
their
very
summits
with
bamboo
and
a
tangle
of
thorny
vines
in
the
bottom
of
the
gorge
a
mountain
torrent
foams
among
huge
bowlders
but
becomes
a
gentle
slow
moving
stream
when
it
leaves
the
cool
darkness
of
the
cañon
to
spread
itself
over
the
terraced
rice
fields
about
a
mile
from
the
entrance
two
old
temples
nestle
into
the
hillside
one
stands
just
over
the
water
but
the
other
clings
to
the
rock
wall
three
hundred
feet
above
the
river
and
it
was
there
that
we
made
our
camp
the
old
priest
in
charge
did
not
appear
especially
delighted
to
see
us
until
i
slipped
a
mexican
dollar
into
his
hand
then
it
was
laughable
to
see
his
change
of
face
the
far
end
of
the
balcony
was
given
up
to
us
while
caldwell
and
oliver
put
up
their
beds
at
the
feet
of
a
grinning
idol
in
the
main
temple
we
had
come
to
to
hunt
serow
chapter
xvii
and
had
brought
with
us
only
a
few
traps
for
small
mammals
harry
had
seen
several
serow
exhibited
for
sale
on
market
days
in
towns
along
the
river
and
all
were
reported
to
have
been
killed
near
this
ravine
there
was
a
village
of
considerable
size
at
the
upper
end
and
here
we
collected
a
motley
lot
of
beaters
with
half
a
dozen
dogs
to
drive
the
top
of
a
mountain
which
towered
about
two
thousand
five
hundred
feet
above
the
river
never
will
we
forget
that
climb
we
tried
to
start
at
daylight
but
it
was
well
toward
six
before
we
got
our
men
together
a
chinaman
would
drive
an
impatient
man
to
apoplexy
and
an
early
grave
for
it
is
impossible
to
get
him
started
within
an
hour
of
the
appointed
time
and
with
a
half
dozen
the
difficulty
is
multiplied
as
many
times
just
when
you
think
all
is
ready
and
that
there
can
be
no
possible
reason
for
delaying
longer
the
whole
crowd
will
disappear
suddenly
and
you
discover
that
they
have
gone
for
chow
then
you
know
that
the
end
is
really
in
sight
for
chow
usually
is
the
last
thing
we
waited
nearly
two
hours
on
this
particular
morning
before
we
started
on
the
long
climb
to
the
top
of
the
mountain
the
sun
was
simply
blazing
and
in
fifteen
minutes
we
were
soaked
with
perspiration
when
we
were
half
way
up
the
dogs
disappeared
in
a
small
ravine
overgrown
with
bamboo
and
sword
grass
and
suddenly
broke
into
a
chorus
of
yelps
they
had
found
a
fresh
trail
and
were
driving
our
way
harry
ran
to
a
narrow
opening
in
the
jungle
shouting
to
us
to
watch
another
higher
up
we
were
hardly
in
position
when
his
rifle
banged
followed
by
such
a
bedlam
of
yells
and
barks
that
we
thought
he
must
have
killed
nothing
less
than
one
of
the
hunters
before
we
reached
them
harry
appeared
smiling
all
over
and
dragging
a
muntjac
by
the
fore
legs
he
had
just
made
a
beautiful
shot
for
the
clearing
he
had
been
watching
was
not
more
than
ten
feet
wide
and
the
muntjac
flashed
across
it
at
full
speed
caldwell
fired
while
it
was
in
and
his
bullet
caught
the
animal
at
the
base
of
the
neck
rolling
it
over
stone
dead
this
beautiful
little
deer
in
fukien
is
hardly
larger
than
a
fox
its
antlers
are
only
two
or
three
inches
in
length
and
rise
from
an
elongated
pedicel
instead
of
from
the
base
of
the
skull
as
in
all
other
members
of
the
deer
family
on
each
side
of
the
upper
jaw
is
a
slender
tusk
about
two
inches
long
which
projects
well
beyond
the
lips
and
makes
a
rather
formidable
weapon
we
hoped
that
this
muntjac
was
going
to
prove
a
good
joss
but
instead
a
disappointing
day
was
in
store
for
us
when
we
had
worked
our
way
to
the
very
summit
of
the
mountain
under
a
merciless
sun
and
over
a
trail
which
led
through
a
smothering
bamboo
jungle
we
saw
dozens
of
fresh
serow
tracks
the
animals
were
there
without
a
doubt
and
we
were
on
the
with
excitement
illustration
a
chinese
hunter
and
a
muntjac
illustration
brigands
killed
in
the
rebellion
we
selected
positions
and
the
men
made
a
long
circuit
to
drive
toward
us
as
caldwell
had
directed
after
half
an
hour
had
passed
we
heard
them
yelling
as
they
closed
in
but
what
was
our
disgust
to
see
them
solemnly
parading
in
single
file
up
the
bottom
of
the
valley
on
an
open
trail
and
carefully
avoiding
all
thickets
where
a
serow
could
possibly
be
as
harry
expressed
it
all
the
animals
had
to
do
was
to
sit
tight
and
watch
the
noble
procession
pass
the
beaters
very
evidently
knew
nothing
whatever
about
driving
nor
were
we
able
to
teach
them
for
they
seriously
objected
to
leaving
the
open
trails
and
going
into
the
bush
we
worked
hard
for
serow
but
the
men
were
hopeless
and
it
was
impossible
to
still
hunt
the
animals
at
that
time
of
the
year
the
natives
say
that
in
september
when
the
mushrooms
are
abundant
in
the
lower
forests
the
serow
leave
the
mountain
tops
and
thick
cover
to
feed
upon
the
fungus
and
that
they
may
be
killed
without
the
aid
of
beaters
but
at
any
time
the
hunt
would
involve
a
vast
amount
of
labor
with
only
a
moderate
chance
of
success
after
we
had
left
fukien
caldwell
purchased
a
fine
male
and
female
serow
for
us
which
are
especially
interesting
as
they
represent
a
different
subspecies
sumatrensis
from
those
we
killed
in
did
yield
us
results
however
for
we
discovered
a
wonderful
bat
cave
less
than
a
mile
from
our
temple
its
entrance
was
a
low
round
hole
half
covered
with
vegetation
and
opening
into
a
high
circular
gallery
from
this
three
long
corridors
branched
off
like
fingers
from
the
palm
of
a
giant
hand
the
cave
was
literally
alive
with
bats
there
must
have
been
ten
thousand
and
on
the
first
day
we
killed
a
hundred
representing
seven
species
and
at
least
four
genera
this
was
especially
remarkable
as
it
is
unusual
to
find
more
than
two
or
three
species
living
together
the
cave
was
a
regular
bat
apartment
house
for
each
corridor
was
divided
by
rock
partitions
into
several
small
rooms
in
every
one
of
which
bats
of
different
species
were
rearing
their
families
the
young
in
most
instances
were
only
a
few
days
old
but
were
thickly
clustered
on
the
walls
and
ceilings
and
each
and
every
one
was
squeaking
at
the
top
of
its
tiny
lungs
the
place
must
have
been
occupied
for
scores
if
not
hundreds
of
years
for
the
floor
was
with
dung
when
we
returned
the
day
after
our
first
visit
we
found
that
many
of
the
young
bats
had
been
removed
by
their
parents
and
in
some
instances
entire
rooms
had
been
vacated
after
the
first
day
the
odor
of
the
cave
was
so
nauseating
that
to
enable
us
to
go
inside
it
was
necessary
to
wear
gauze
pads
of
iodoform
over
our
noses
the
bats
at
this
place
were
killed
with
bamboo
switches
but
later
we
always
used
a
long
gill
net
which
had
been
especially
made
in
new
york
we
could
hang
the
net
over
the
entrance
to
a
cave
and
when
all
was
ready
send
a
native
into
the
galleries
to
stir
up
the
animals
as
they
flew
out
they
became
entangled
in
the
net
and
could
be
caught
or
killed
before
they
were
able
to
get
away
it
was
sometimes
possible
to
catch
every
specimen
in
a
cavern
and
moreover
to
secure
them
in
perfect
condition
without
broken
skulls
or
wings
if
a
bat
escaped
from
the
net
it
would
never
again
strike
it
for
the
animals
are
wonderfully
accurate
in
flight
and
most
expert
dodgers
even
while
in
a
cave
where
hundreds
of
bats
were
in
the
air
they
seldom
flew
against
us
although
we
might
often
be
brushed
by
their
wings
and
it
was
a
most
difficult
thing
to
hit
them
with
a
bamboo
switch
their
ability
in
dodging
is
without
doubt
a
necessary
development
of
their
feeding
habits
for
with
the
exception
of
a
few
species
bats
live
exclusively
upon
insects
and
catch
them
in
the
air
it
is
a
rather
terrifying
experience
for
a
girl
to
sit
in
a
bat
cave
especially
if
the
light
has
gone
out
and
she
is
in
utter
darkness
of
course
she
has
a
cap
tightly
pulled
over
her
ears
for
what
girl
even
if
she
be
a
naturalist
wife
would
venture
into
a
den
of
evil
bats
with
one
wisp
of
hair
exposed
all
about
is
the
swish
of
ghostly
wings
which
brush
her
face
or
neck
and
the
air
is
full
of
chattering
noises
like
the
grinding
of
hundreds
of
tiny
teeth
sometimes
a
soft
little
body
plumps
into
her
lap
and
if
she
dares
to
take
her
hands
from
her
face
long
enough
to
disengage
the
clinging
animal
she
is
liable
to
receive
a
vicious
bite
from
teeth
as
sharp
as
needles
but
withal
it
is
good
fun
and
think
how
quickly
formalin
jars
or
collecting
trays
can
be
filled
with
beautiful
specimens
chapter
v
the
rebellion
on
sunday
june
we
went
to
the
bat
cave
to
obtain
a
new
supply
of
specimens
upon
our
return
just
as
we
were
about
to
sit
down
to
luncheon
four
excited
chinese
appeared
with
the
following
letter
from
caldwell
dear
roy
there
was
quite
a
lively
time
in
the
city
at
an
early
hour
this
morning
the
rebels
have
taken
and
it
looks
as
though
there
was
trouble
ahead
northern
soldiers
have
been
sent
for
and
the
chances
are
that
either
tonight
or
tomorrow
morning
there
will
be
quite
a
battle
bankhardt
trimble
and
myself
have
just
made
a
round
of
the
city
visiting
the
telegraph
office
post
office
and
other
places
and
while
we
do
not
believe
that
the
foreigners
will
be
molested
nevertheless
it
is
impossible
to
tell
just
what
to
expect
it
is
certain
however
that
the
consul
will
order
all
of
us
to
foochow
if
news
of
the
situation
reaches
there
owing
to
the
uncertainty
i
think
you
had
better
come
in
to
so
as
to
be
ready
for
any
eventuality
after
talking
the
situation
over
with
trimble
and
bankhardt
we
all
agreed
that
the
wisest
thing
is
for
you
to
come
in
immediately
i
am
sending
four
for
it
will
be
out
of
the
question
to
find
any
tomorrow
if
trouble
occurs
tonight
the
city
gates
are
closed
so
you
will
have
to
climb
up
the
ladder
over
the
wall
behind
our
compound
best
wishes
harry
later
it
is
again
reported
that
northern
soldiers
are
to
arrive
tonight
if
they
do
and
trouble
occurs
your
only
chance
is
to
get
to
today
the
camp
immediately
was
thrown
into
confusion
for
the
cook
and
the
were
jabbering
excitedly
at
the
top
of
their
voices
the
servants
began
to
pack
the
loads
at
once
and
meanwhile
we
ate
a
roast
chicken
faster
than
good
table
manners
would
permit
in
fact
we
took
it
in
our
fingers
we
were
both
delighted
at
the
prospect
of
some
excitement
and
talked
almost
as
fast
as
the
chinese
in
just
one
hour
from
the
time
harry
letter
had
been
received
we
were
on
the
way
to
it
was
the
hottest
part
of
the
day
and
we
were
dripping
with
perspiration
when
we
left
the
cool
darkness
of
the
ravine
and
struck
across
the
open
valley
which
lay
shimmering
in
a
heat
at
the
first
rest
house
an
the
top
of
the
long
hill
we
waited
nearly
an
hour
for
our
bearers
who
were
struggling
under
the
heavy
loads
three
miles
farther
on
a
poor
woman
tottered
past
us
on
her
peglike
feet
leaning
on
the
arm
of
a
man
a
short
distance
more
and
we
came
to
the
second
rest
house
we
had
been
there
but
a
few
moments
when
three
panting
women
steadying
themselves
with
long
staves
and
barely
able
to
walk
on
feet
not
more
than
four
inches
long
came
up
the
hill
with
them
were
several
men
bearing
household
goods
in
large
bundles
and
huge
red
boxes
the
exhausted
women
sank
upon
the
benches
and
fanned
themselves
while
the
perspiration
ran
down
their
flushed
faces
they
looked
so
utterly
miserable
that
we
told
the
cook
to
give
them
a
piece
of
cake
which
caldwell
had
sent
us
the
day
before
their
gratitude
was
pitiful
but
of
course
they
gave
the
larger
share
to
the
men
it
was
not
long
before
other
women
and
children
appeared
on
the
hill
path
all
struggling
upward
under
heavy
loads
or
tottering
along
on
tightly
bound
feet
probably
these
women
had
not
walked
so
far
in
their
entire
lives
but
the
fear
of
the
northern
soldiers
and
what
would
happen
in
the
city
if
they
took
possession
had
driven
them
from
their
homes
farther
on
we
had
a
clear
view
across
the
valley
where
a
long
line
of
people
was
filing
up
to
a
temple
which
nestled
into
the
hillside
half
a
mile
beyond
were
two
other
temples
both
crowded
with
refugees
and
their
goods
hundreds
of
families
were
seeking
shelter
in
every
little
house
beside
the
road
and
were
overflowing
into
the
cowsheds
and
pigpens
at
six
we
stood
on
the
summit
of
the
hill
overlooking
the
city
and
half
an
hour
later
were
clambering
up
the
ladder
over
the
high
wall
of
the
compound
just
behind
trimble
house
we
were
wet
through
and
while
cooling
off
heard
the
story
of
the
morning
fighting
it
seemed
that
a
certain
element
in
the
city
was
in
coöperation
with
the
representatives
of
the
revolutionary
organization
these
men
wished
to
obtain
possession
of
and
after
the
rebellion
was
well
started
to
gather
forces
march
to
foochow
and
force
the
governor
to
declare
the
independence
of
the
province
the
plot
had
been
hatching
for
several
days
but
the
death
of
yuan
had
somewhat
delayed
its
fruition
saturday
however
it
was
known
throughout
the
city
that
trouble
would
soon
begin
sunday
morning
at
half
past
three
a
band
of
one
hundred
men
from
yuchi
had
marched
to
where
they
were
received
by
a
delegation
of
rebels
dressed
in
white
who
opened
to
them
the
east
gate
of
the
city
immediately
they
began
to
fire
up
the
streets
to
intimidate
the
people
and
in
a
short
time
were
in
a
hot
engagement
with
the
seventeen
northern
soldiers
some
of
whom
threw
away
their
guns
and
swam
across
the
river
the
remaining
city
troops
were
from
the
province
of
hunan
and
their
sympathies
were
really
with
the
south
in
the
great
rebellion
these
immediately
joined
the
rebels
where
they
were
received
with
open
arms
it
was
reported
that
the
district
mandarin
had
asked
for
troops
from
foochow
and
that
these
might
be
expected
at
any
moment
thus
when
they
arrived
a
real
battle
could
be
expected
and
it
was
very
likely
that
the
city
would
be
partly
destroyed
we
had
a
picnic
supper
on
the
caldwell
porch
and
discussed
the
situation
it
was
the
opinion
of
all
that
the
foreigners
were
in
no
immediate
danger
but
nevertheless
it
was
considered
wise
to
be
prepared
and
we
decided
upon
posts
for
each
man
if
it
should
become
necessary
to
protect
the
compound
hundreds
of
people
were
besieging
the
missionaries
with
requests
to
be
allowed
to
bring
their
goods
and
families
inside
the
walls
but
these
necessarily
had
to
be
refused
had
the
missionaries
allowed
the
chinese
to
bring
their
valuables
inside
it
would
have
cost
them
the
right
of
consular
protection
and
moreover
their
compound
would
have
been
the
first
to
be
attacked
if
looting
began
on
monday
morning
while
we
were
sitting
on
the
porch
of
house
preparing
some
bird
skins
there
came
a
sharp
crackle
of
rifle
fire
and
then
a
roar
of
shots
bullets
began
to
whistle
over
us
and
we
could
see
puffs
of
smoke
as
the
deep
bang
of
a
black
powder
gun
punctuated
the
vicious
snapping
of
the
rifles
the
firing
gradually
ceased
after
half
an
hour
and
we
decided
to
go
down
to
the
city
to
see
what
had
happened
for
as
no
northern
troops
had
appeared
the
cause
of
the
fighting
was
a
mystery
we
went
first
to
the
mission
hospital
which
lay
across
a
deep
ravine
and
only
a
few
yards
from
the
quarters
of
the
soldiers
at
the
door
of
the
hospital
compound
lay
a
bloody
rag
and
we
found
trimble
in
the
operating
room
examining
a
wounded
man
who
had
just
been
brought
in
the
fellow
had
been
shot
in
the
abdomen
with
a
lead
ball
that
had
gone
entirely
through
him
emerging
about
three
inches
to
the
right
of
his
spine
from
the
doctor
we
got
the
first
real
news
of
the
puzzling
situation
it
appeared
that
all
the
men
who
had
arrived
sunday
morning
from
yuchi
to
join
the
rebels
were
in
reality
brigands
and
to
save
their
own
lives
the
hunan
soldiers
quartered
in
the
city
had
played
a
clever
trick
they
had
pretended
to
join
the
rebels
but
at
a
given
signal
had
turned
upon
them
killing
or
capturing
almost
every
one
although
their
sympathies
were
really
with
the
south
the
hunan
men
knew
that
the
rebels
in
could
not
hold
the
city
against
the
northern
soldiers
from
foochow
and
by
crushing
the
rebellion
themselves
they
hoped
to
avert
a
bigger
fight
as
we
could
not
help
the
doctor
he
suggested
that
we
might
be
of
some
assistance
to
the
wounded
in
the
city
and
with
rude
crosses
of
red
cloth
pinned
to
our
white
shirt
sleeves
we
left
the
hospital
accompanied
by
four
chinese
attendants
bearing
a
stretcher
in
the
compound
we
met
a
chair
in
which
was
lying
an
old
man
groaning
loudly
and
dripping
with
blood
beside
him
were
his
wife
and
several
boys
the
poor
woman
was
crying
quietly
and
between
her
sobs
was
offering
the
wounded
man
mustard
pickles
from
a
small
dish
in
her
hand
poor
things
they
have
so
little
to
eat
that
they
believe
food
will
cure
all
ills
the
bearers
set
the
chair
down
as
we
appeared
and
lifted
the
filthy
rag
which
covered
a
gaping
wound
in
the
man
shoulder
over
which
had
been
plastered
a
great
mass
of
cow
dung
just
think
of
the
infection
but
it
was
the
only
remedy
they
knew
we
took
the
man
upstairs
where
trimble
was
preparing
to
operate
on
the
fellow
who
had
been
shot
in
the
abdomen
the
doctor
was
working
steadily
and
quietly
making
every
move
count
and
inspiring
his
native
hospital
staff
with
his
own
coolness
the
way
this
young
missionary
handled
his
cases
made
us
glad
that
he
was
an
american
on
the
way
down
the
hill
several
soldiers
passed
us
each
carrying
four
or
five
rifles
and
slung
about
with
cartridge
belts
plunder
stripped
from
the
men
who
had
been
killed
a
few
hundred
yards
farther
on
we
found
two
brigands
lying
dead
in
a
narrow
street
the
nearest
one
had
fallen
on
his
face
and
as
we
turned
him
over
we
saw
that
half
his
head
had
been
blown
away
the
other
was
staring
upward
with
wide
open
eyes
on
which
the
flies
already
were
settling
in
swarms
there
was
little
use
in
wasting
time
over
these
men
who
long
ago
had
passed
beyond
need
of
our
help
and
we
went
on
rapidly
down
the
alley
to
the
main
thoroughfare
guided
by
a
small
boy
we
hurried
over
the
rough
stones
for
fifteen
minutes
and
suddenly
came
to
a
man
lying
at
the
side
of
the
street
his
head
propped
on
a
wooden
block
an
umbrella
once
had
partly
covered
him
but
had
fallen
away
leaving
him
unprotected
in
the
broiling
sun
his
face
and
a
terrible
wound
in
his
head
were
a
solid
mass
of
flies
and
thousands
of
insects
were
crawling
over
the
blood
clots
on
the
stones
beside
him
at
first
we
thought
he
was
dead
but
soon
saw
his
abdomen
move
and
realized
that
he
was
breathing
it
did
not
seem
possible
that
a
human
being
could
live
under
such
conditions
and
yet
the
bystanders
told
us
that
he
had
been
lying
there
for
thirty
hours
he
had
been
shot
early
the
previous
morning
and
it
was
now
three
of
the
next
afternoon
the
man
was
a
poor
who
lived
with
his
wife
in
the
most
utter
poverty
he
had
been
peering
over
the
city
wall
when
the
firing
began
sunday
morning
and
was
one
of
the
first
innocent
bystanders
to
pay
the
penalty
of
his
curiosity
i
asked
why
he
had
not
been
taken
to
the
hospital
and
the
answer
was
that
his
wife
was
too
poor
to
hire
anyone
to
carry
him
and
he
had
no
friends
so
there
he
lay
in
the
burning
sun
gazed
at
by
hundreds
of
without
one
hand
being
lifted
to
help
him
our
hospital
attendants
brushed
away
the
flies
placed
him
in
the
stretcher
and
started
up
the
long
hill
followed
by
the
haggard
weeping
wife
and
a
curious
crowd
on
every
hand
were
questions
why
are
these
men
taking
him
away
what
are
they
going
to
do
with
him
but
several
educated
natives
who
understood
said
a
work
of
love
they
got
right
there
a
lesson
in
christianity
which
they
will
not
soon
forget
it
is
seldom
that
chinese
try
to
help
an
injured
man
for
ever
present
in
their
minds
is
the
possibility
that
he
may
die
and
that
they
will
be
responsible
for
his
burial
expenses
we
left
the
stretcher
bearers
at
the
corner
of
the
main
street
with
orders
to
return
as
soon
as
they
had
deposited
the
man
in
the
hospital
and
under
the
guidance
of
a
boy
hurried
toward
the
east
gate
where
it
was
said
seven
or
eight
men
had
been
shot
our
guide
took
us
first
to
a
brigand
who
had
been
wounded
and
left
to
die
beside
the
gutter
the
corpse
was
a
horrible
sight
and
with
a
feeling
of
deathly
nausea
we
made
a
hurried
examination
and
walked
to
the
gate
at
the
end
of
the
street
a
dozen
soldiers
were
on
guard
we
learned
from
the
officer
that
there
were
no
wounded
in
the
pile
of
dead
just
beyond
the
entrance
so
we
turned
toward
the
river
bank
and
rapidly
patrolled
the
alleys
leading
to
the
official
residence
where
the
firing
had
been
heaviest
the
was
crowded
with
soldiers
and
we
were
informed
that
the
dead
had
all
been
removed
and
that
there
were
no
wounded
a
grim
statement
which
told
its
own
story
the
is
but
a
short
distance
from
the
hospital
so
we
climbed
the
hill
to
the
compound
the
sun
was
simply
blazing
and
i
realized
then
what
the
wounded
men
must
have
suffered
lying
in
the
heat
without
shelter
we
returned
to
the
house
and
were
resting
on
the
upper
porch
when
suddenly
far
down
the
river
we
saw
the
glint
of
rifle
barrels
in
the
sunlight
and
with
field
glasses
made
out
a
long
line
of
men
winding
along
the
shore
trail
at
the
same
time
two
huge
boats
filled
with
soldiers
came
into
view
heading
for
the
water
gate
of
the
city
these
were
undoubtedly
the
northern
troops
from
foochow
who
were
expected
monday
night
even
as
we
looked
there
came
a
sudden
roar
of
musketry
and
a
cloud
of
smoke
drifted
up
from
the
barracks
right
below
us
then
a
rattling
fusillade
of
shots
we
could
see
soldiers
running
along
the
walls
firing
at
men
below
and
often
in
our
direction
bullets
hummed
in
the
air
like
angry
bees
and
we
rushed
for
cover
but
in
a
few
moments
the
firing
ceased
as
suddenly
as
it
began
we
were
at
a
loss
to
know
what
it
all
meant
and
why
the
troops
were
firing
upon
the
northern
soldiers
whom
they
wished
to
placate
it
was
still
a
mystery
when
we
sat
down
to
dinner
at
half
past
seven
but
a
few
minutes
later
bankhardt
rushed
in
saying
that
he
had
just
received
a
note
from
the
the
mandarin
personal
servant
had
brought
word
that
the
northern
soldiers
who
had
just
entered
the
city
were
going
to
kill
him
and
he
begged
the
missionaries
for
assistance
bankhardt
also
told
us
of
the
latest
developments
in
the
situation
it
seems
that
the
city
soldiers
supposed
the
northern
troops
to
be
brigands
and
had
fired
upon
them
and
killed
several
before
they
discovered
their
mistake
a
very
delicate
situation
had
thus
been
precipitated
for
the
northern
commander
believed
that
it
was
treachery
and
intended
to
attack
the
barracks
in
the
morning
and
kill
every
man
whom
he
found
with
a
rifle
as
well
as
all
the
city
officials
the
story
of
the
way
in
which
the
missionaries
acted
as
peacemakers
saved
the
and
prevented
the
slaughter
which
surely
would
have
taken
place
in
the
morning
is
too
long
to
be
told
here
for
it
was
accomplished
only
after
hours
of
the
talk
and
face
saving
so
dear
to
the
heart
of
the
oriental
suffice
it
to
say
that
through
the
exercise
of
great
tact
and
a
thorough
understanding
of
the
chinese
character
they
were
able
to
settle
the
matter
without
bloodshed
the
following
day
twenty
brigands
were
given
a
trial
marched
off
to
the
west
gate
beheaded
amid
great
enthusiasm
and
the
incident
was
closed
in
the
afternoon
a
messenger
called
and
delivered
to
each
of
us
an
official
letter
from
the
commander
of
the
northern
troops
thanking
us
for
the
part
we
had
played
in
averting
trouble
and
bringing
the
matter
to
a
peaceful
end
an
interesting
sidelight
on
the
affair
was
received
a
few
days
later
a
young
man
a
christian
who
was
born
in
the
same
town
from
which
a
number
of
the
brigands
had
come
went
to
his
house
on
monday
night
after
the
fight
and
found
seven
of
the
robbers
concealed
in
his
bedroom
he
was
terrified
because
if
they
were
discovered
he
and
all
his
family
would
be
killed
for
aiding
the
bandits
he
told
them
they
must
leave
at
once
but
they
pleaded
with
him
to
let
them
stay
for
they
knew
there
were
soldiers
at
every
corner
and
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
get
away
while
he
was
imploring
them
to
go
a
knock
sounded
at
the
door
he
pushed
the
brigands
into
the
courtyard
and
opened
to
three
soldiers
they
said
we
understand
you
have
brigands
in
your
house
he
was
trembling
with
fear
but
answered
come
in
and
see
for
yourself
if
you
think
so
the
soldiers
were
satisfied
by
his
frank
open
manner
and
as
they
knew
him
to
be
a
good
man
did
not
search
the
house
but
went
away
the
poor
fellow
was
frightened
nearly
to
death
but
as
his
place
was
being
watched
it
was
impossible
for
the
brigands
to
leave
during
the
day
at
night
they
stripped
themselves
shaved
their
heads
and
dressed
like
coolies
and
were
able
to
get
to
the
ladder
down
the
city
wall
just
below
the
mission
compound
where
they
could
escape
into
the
hills
the
day
after
this
occurrence
about
four
in
the
afternoon
a
breathless
chinese
appeared
at
the
house
with
a
note
to
bankhardt
saying
that
his
chinese
teacher
and
the
mission
school
cook
had
been
arrested
by
the
northern
soldiers
and
were
to
be
beheaded
in
an
hour
we
hurried
to
the
police
office
where
they
were
confined
and
found
that
not
only
the
two
men
but
three
others
were
in
custody
the
mission
cook
owned
a
small
restaurant
under
the
management
of
one
of
his
relatives
and
while
bankhardt
teacher
and
the
other
man
were
sitting
at
a
table
some
northern
soldiers
appeared
one
of
whom
owed
the
restaurant
keeper
a
small
amount
of
money
when
asked
to
pay
the
soldier
turned
upon
him
and
shouted
you
have
been
assisting
the
brigands
i
saw
some
of
them
carrying
goods
into
your
house
thereupon
the
soldiers
arrested
everyone
in
the
shop
the
police
officials
were
quite
ready
to
release
the
teacher
and
the
other
man
upon
our
statements
but
they
would
not
allow
the
cook
to
go
his
hands
were
kept
tightly
bound
and
he
was
chained
to
a
post
by
the
neck
the
soldier
who
arrested
him
was
his
sole
accuser
but
of
course
others
would
appear
to
uphold
him
in
his
charge
if
it
were
necessary
the
cook
was
as
innocent
as
any
one
of
the
missionaries
but
it
required
several
hours
of
work
and
threats
of
complaint
to
the
government
at
foochow
to
prevent
the
man
from
being
summarily
executed
we
were
not
able
to
get
any
mail
from
foochow
during
the
rebellion
because
the
constant
stream
of
northern
soldiers
on
their
way
up
the
river
had
paralyzed
the
entire
country
to
such
an
extent
that
all
the
river
men
had
fled
the
soldiers
were
firing
for
target
practice
upon
every
boat
they
saw
on
the
river
and
dozens
of
men
had
been
killed
and
then
robbed
the
northern
commander
told
us
frankly
that
this
could
not
be
prevented
and
when
we
announced
that
we
were
going
to
start
with
all
the
missionaries
down
the
river
on
the
following
day
he
was
very
much
disturbed
he
insisted
that
we
have
american
flags
displayed
on
our
boats
to
prevent
being
fired
upon
by
the
soldiers
although
it
had
taken
eight
days
to
work
our
way
laboriously
through
the
rapids
and
up
the
river
from
foochow
to
we
covered
the
same
distance
down
the
river
in
hours
and
had
breakfast
with
kellogg
at
his
house
the
morning
after
we
left
in
two
days
our
equipment
was
repacked
and
ready
for
the
trip
to
futsing
to
hunt
the
blue
tiger
chapter
vi
hunting
the
great
invisible
for
many
years
before
caldwell
went
to
he
had
been
stationed
at
the
city
of
futsing
about
thirty
miles
from
foochow
much
of
his
work
consisted
of
itinerant
trips
during
which
he
visited
the
various
mission
stations
under
his
charge
he
almost
invariably
went
on
foot
from
place
to
place
and
carried
with
him
a
butterfly
net
and
a
rifle
so
that
to
so
keen
a
naturalist
each
day
walk
was
full
of
interest
the
country
was
infested
with
tigers
and
very
often
the
villagers
implored
him
to
rid
their
neighborhood
of
some
one
of
the
yellow
raiders
which
had
been
killing
their
children
pigs
or
cattle
during
ten
years
he
had
killed
seven
tigers
in
the
futsing
region
he
often
said
that
his
gun
had
been
just
as
effective
in
carrying
christianity
to
the
natives
as
had
his
evangelistic
work
although
caldwell
has
been
especially
fortunate
and
has
killed
his
tigers
without
ever
really
hunting
them
nevertheless
it
is
a
most
uncertain
sport
as
we
were
destined
to
learn
the
tiger
is
the
great
invisible
he
is
everywhere
and
nowhere
here
today
and
gone
tomorrow
a
sportsman
in
china
may
get
his
shot
the
first
day
out
or
he
may
hunt
for
weeks
without
ever
seeing
a
tiger
even
though
they
are
all
about
him
and
it
is
this
very
uncertainty
that
makes
the
game
all
the
more
fascinating
the
part
of
fukien
province
about
futsing
includes
mountains
of
considerable
height
many
of
which
are
planted
with
rice
and
support
a
surprising
number
of
chinese
who
are
grouped
in
closely
connected
villages
while
the
cultivated
valleys
afford
no
cover
for
tiger
and
the
mountain
slopes
themselves
are
usually
more
or
less
denuded
of
forest
yet
the
deep
and
narrow
ravines
choked
with
sword
grass
and
thorny
bramble
offer
an
impenetrable
retreat
in
which
an
animal
can
sleep
during
the
day
without
fear
of
being
disturbed
it
is
possible
for
a
man
to
make
his
way
through
these
lairs
only
by
means
of
the
paths
and
tunnels
which
have
been
opened
by
the
tigers
themselves
caldwell
usual
method
of
hunting
was
to
lead
a
goat
with
one
or
two
kids
to
an
open
place
where
they
could
be
fastened
just
outside
the
edge
of
the
lair
and
then
to
conceal
himself
a
few
feet
away
the
bleating
of
the
goats
would
usually
bring
the
tiger
into
the
open
where
there
would
be
an
opportunity
for
a
shot
in
the
late
afternoon
caldwell
first
experience
in
hunting
tigers
was
with
a
shotgun
at
the
village
of
his
had
not
arrived
with
the
basket
containing
his
rifle
and
as
it
was
already
late
in
the
afternoon
he
suggested
to
the
chinese
boy
who
was
his
constant
companion
that
they
make
a
preliminary
inspection
of
the
lair
even
though
they
carried
only
shotguns
loaded
with
lead
slugs
about
the
size
of
buckshot
they
tethered
a
goat
just
outside
the
edge
of
the
lair
and
the
tiger
responded
to
its
bleating
almost
immediately
caldwell
did
not
see
the
animal
until
it
came
into
the
open
about
fifty
yards
away
and
remained
in
plain
view
for
almost
half
an
hour
the
tiger
seemed
to
suspect
danger
and
crouched
on
the
terrace
now
and
then
putting
his
right
foot
forward
a
short
distance
and
drawing
it
slowly
back
again
he
had
approached
along
a
small
trail
but
before
he
could
reach
the
goat
it
was
necessary
to
cross
an
open
space
a
few
yards
in
width
and
to
do
this
the
animal
flattened
himself
like
a
huge
striped
serpent
his
head
was
extended
so
that
the
throat
and
chin
were
touching
the
ground
and
there
was
absolutely
no
motion
of
the
body
other
than
the
hips
and
shoulders
as
the
beast
slid
along
at
an
amazingly
rapid
rate
but
at
the
instant
the
cat
gained
the
nearest
cover
it
made
three
flying
leaps
and
landed
at
the
foot
of
the
terrace
upon
which
the
goat
was
tied
just
then
he
saw
me
said
caldwell
and
slowly
pushed
his
great
face
over
the
edge
of
the
grass
not
fifteen
feet
away
i
fired
at
his
head
and
neck
he
leaped
into
the
air
with
the
blood
spurting
over
the
grass
and
fell
into
a
heap
but
gathered
himself
and
slid
down
over
the
terraces
as
he
went
i
fired
a
second
load
of
slugs
into
his
hip
he
turned
about
slowly
climbed
the
hill
parallel
with
us
and
stood
looking
back
at
me
his
face
streaming
with
blood
i
was
fumbling
in
my
coat
trying
to
find
other
shells
but
before
i
could
reload
the
gun
he
walked
unsteadily
into
the
lair
and
lay
down
it
was
already
too
dark
to
follow
and
the
next
morning
a
bloody
trail
showed
where
he
had
gone
upward
into
the
grass
later
in
the
same
afternoon
he
was
found
dead
by
some
chinese
more
than
three
miles
away
during
his
many
experiences
with
the
futsing
tigers
caldwell
has
learned
much
about
their
habits
and
peculiarities
and
some
of
his
observations
are
given
in
the
following
pages
the
tiger
is
by
instinct
a
coward
when
confronted
by
his
greatest
enemy
man
bold
and
daring
as
he
may
be
when
circumstances
are
in
his
favor
he
will
hurriedly
abandon
a
fresh
kill
at
the
first
cry
of
a
shepherd
boy
attending
a
flock
on
the
and
will
always
weigh
conditions
before
making
an
attack
if
things
do
not
exactly
suit
him
nothing
will
tempt
him
to
charge
into
the
open
upon
what
may
appear
to
be
an
isolated
and
defenseless
goat
an
experience
i
had
in
april
will
illustrate
this
point
i
led
a
goat
into
a
ravine
where
a
tiger
which
had
been
working
havoc
among
the
herds
of
the
farmers
was
said
to
live
this
animal
only
a
few
days
previous
to
my
hunt
had
attacked
a
herd
of
cows
and
killed
three
of
them
but
on
this
occasion
the
beast
must
have
suspected
danger
and
was
exceedingly
cautious
he
advanced
under
cover
along
a
trail
until
within
one
hundred
feet
of
the
goat
and
there
stopped
to
make
a
survey
of
the
surroundings
peering
into
the
valley
he
saw
two
men
at
a
distance
of
five
hundred
yards
or
more
cutting
grass
and
after
watching
intently
for
a
time
the
great
cat
turned
and
bounded
away
into
the
bushes
on
another
occasion
this
tiger
awaited
an
opportunity
to
attack
a
cow
which
a
farmer
was
using
in
plowing
his
field
the
man
had
unhitched
his
cow
and
squatted
down
in
the
rice
paddy
to
eat
his
meal
when
the
tiger
suddenly
rushed
from
cover
and
killed
the
animal
only
a
few
yards
behind
the
peasant
this
shows
how
daring
a
tiger
may
be
when
he
is
able
to
strike
from
the
rear
and
when
circumstances
seem
to
favor
an
attack
i
have
known
tigers
to
rush
at
a
dog
or
hog
standing
inside
a
chinese
house
where
there
was
the
usual
confusion
of
such
a
dwelling
and
in
almost
every
instance
the
victim
was
killed
although
it
was
not
always
carried
away
there
is
probably
no
creature
in
the
wilds
which
shows
such
a
combination
of
daring
strategy
and
slinking
cowardice
as
the
tiger
often
courage
fails
him
after
he
has
secured
his
victim
and
he
releases
it
to
dash
off
into
the
nearest
wood
i
knew
of
two
chinese
who
were
deer
hunting
on
a
when
a
large
tiger
was
routed
from
his
bed
the
beast
made
a
rushing
attack
on
the
man
standing
nearest
to
the
path
of
his
retreat
and
seizing
him
by
the
leg
dragged
him
into
the
ravine
below
luckily
the
man
succeeded
in
grasping
a
small
tree
whereupon
the
tiger
released
his
hold
leaving
his
victim
lying
upon
the
ground
almost
paralyzed
with
pain
and
fear
a
group
of
men
were
gathering
fuel
on
the
hills
near
futsing
when
a
tiger
which
had
been
sleeping
in
the
high
grass
was
disturbed
the
enraged
beast
tinned
upon
the
peasants
killing
two
of
them
instantly
and
striking
another
a
ripping
blow
with
his
paw
which
sent
him
lifeless
to
the
terrace
below
the
beast
did
not
attempt
to
drag
either
of
its
victims
into
the
bush
or
to
attack
the
other
persons
near
by
the
strength
and
vitality
of
a
full
grown
tiger
are
amazing
i
had
occasion
to
spend
the
night
a
short
time
ago
in
a
place
where
a
tiger
had
performed
some
remarkable
feats
just
at
dusk
one
of
these
marauders
visited
the
village
and
discovered
a
cow
and
her
calf
in
a
pen
which
had
been
excavated
in
the
side
of
a
hill
and
adjoined
a
house
there
was
no
possible
way
to
enter
the
enclosure
except
by
a
door
opening
from
the
main
part
of
the
dwelling
or
to
descend
from
above
the
tiger
jumped
from
the
roof
upon
the
neck
of
the
heifer
killing
it
instantly
and
the
inmates
of
the
house
opened
the
door
just
in
time
to
see
the
animal
throw
the
calf
out
bodily
and
leap
after
it
himself
i
measured
the
embankment
and
found
that
the
exact
height
was
twelve
and
a
half
feet
the
same
tiger
one
noon
on
a
foggy
day
attacked
a
hog
just
back
of
the
village
and
carried
it
into
the
hills
the
villagers
pursued
the
beast
and
overtook
it
within
half
a
mile
when
the
hog
which
dressed
weighed
more
than
two
hundred
pounds
was
found
it
had
no
marks
or
bruises
upon
it
other
than
the
deep
fang
wounds
in
the
neck
this
is
another
instance
where
courage
failed
a
tiger
after
he
had
made
off
with
his
kill
to
a
safe
distance
the
chinese
declare
that
when
carrying
such
a
load
a
tiger
never
attempts
to
drag
its
prey
but
throws
it
across
its
back
and
races
off
at
top
speed
the
finest
trophy
taken
from
fukien
province
in
years
i
shot
in
may
two
days
previous
to
my
hunt
this
tiger
had
killed
and
eaten
a
boy
i
happened
to
be
in
the
locality
and
decided
to
make
an
attempt
to
dispose
of
the
troublesome
beast
obtaining
a
mother
goat
with
two
small
kids
i
led
them
into
a
ravine
near
where
the
boy
had
been
killed
the
goat
was
tied
to
a
tree
a
short
distance
from
the
lair
and
the
kids
were
concealed
in
the
tall
grass
well
in
toward
the
place
where
the
tiger
would
probably
be
i
selected
a
suitable
spot
and
kneeled
down
behind
a
bank
of
ferns
and
grass
the
fact
that
one
may
be
stalked
by
the
very
beast
which
one
is
hunting
adds
to
the
excitement
and
keeps
one
nerves
on
edge
i
expected
that
the
tiger
would
approach
stealthily
as
long
as
he
could
not
see
the
goat
as
the
usual
plan
of
attack
so
far
as
my
observation
goes
is
to
creep
up
under
cover
as
far
as
possible
before
rushing
into
the
open
in
any
case
the
tiger
would
be
within
twenty
yards
of
me
before
it
could
be
seen
for
more
than
two
hours
i
sat
perfectly
still
alert
and
waiting
behind
the
little
blind
of
ferns
and
grass
there
was
nothing
to
break
the
silence
other
than
the
incessant
bleating
of
the
goats
and
the
unpleasant
rasping
call
of
the
mountain
jay
i
had
about
given
up
hope
of
a
shot
when
suddenly
the
huge
head
of
the
emerged
from
the
bush
exactly
where
i
had
expected
he
would
appear
and
within
fifteen
feet
of
the
kids
the
back
neck
and
head
of
the
beast
were
in
almost
the
same
plane
as
he
moved
noiselessly
forward
i
had
implicit
confidence
in
the
killing
power
of
the
gun
in
my
hand
and
at
the
crack
of
the
rifle
the
huge
brute
settled
forward
with
hardly
a
quiver
not
ten
feet
from
the
kids
upon
which
he
was
about
to
spring
a
second
shot
was
not
necessary
but
was
fired
as
a
matter
of
precaution
as
the
tiger
had
fallen
behind
rank
grass
and
the
bullet
passed
through
the
shoulder
blade
lodging
in
the
spine
the
beast
measured
more
than
nine
feet
and
weighed
almost
four
hundred
pounds
upon
hearing
the
shots
the
villagers
swarmed
into
the
ravine
each
eager
not
so
much
to
see
their
slain
tormentor
as
to
gather
up
the
blood
but
little
attention
was
paid
to
the
tiger
until
every
available
drop
was
sopped
up
with
rags
torn
from
their
clothing
whilst
men
and
children
even
pulled
up
the
grass
i
learned
that
the
blood
of
a
tiger
is
used
for
two
purposes
a
bit
of
cloth
is
tied
about
the
neck
of
a
child
as
a
preventive
against
either
measles
or
smallpox
and
tiger
flesh
is
eaten
for
the
same
purpose
it
is
also
said
that
if
a
handkerchief
stained
with
tiger
blood
is
waved
in
front
of
an
attacking
dog
the
animal
will
slink
away
cowed
and
terrified
from
the
chinese
point
of
view
the
skin
is
not
the
most
valuable
part
of
a
tiger
almost
always
before
a
hunt
is
made
or
a
trap
is
built
the
villagers
hum
incense
before
the
temple
god
and
an
agreement
is
made
to
the
effect
that
if
the
enterprise
be
successful
the
skin
of
the
beast
taken
becomes
the
property
of
the
gods
thus
it
happens
that
in
many
of
the
temples
handsome
robes
may
be
found
spread
in
the
chair
occupied
by
the
noted
uong
or
the
god
of
the
land
when
a
hunt
is
successful
the
flesh
and
bones
are
considered
of
greatest
value
and
it
often
happens
that
a
number
of
cows
are
killed
and
their
flesh
mixed
with
that
of
the
tiger
to
be
sold
at
the
exorbitant
price
cheerfully
paid
for
tiger
meat
the
bones
are
boiled
for
a
number
of
days
until
a
product
results
and
this
is
believed
to
be
exceptionally
efficacious
medicine
notwithstanding
the
danger
of
a
tiger
in
the
tangle
of
its
lair
one
can
not
but
feel
richly
rewarded
for
the
risk
when
one
begins
to
sum
up
one
observations
the
most
interesting
result
of
investigating
an
lair
is
concerning
the
animal
food
that
a
tiger
always
devours
its
prey
upon
the
spot
where
it
is
taken
or
in
the
adjacent
bush
is
an
erroneous
idea
this
is
often
true
when
the
kill
is
too
heavy
to
be
carried
for
a
long
distance
but
it
is
by
no
means
universally
so
not
long
ago
the
remains
of
a
young
boy
were
found
in
a
grave
adjacent
to
a
tiger
lair
a
few
miles
from
futsing
city
no
child
had
been
reported
missing
in
the
immediate
neighborhood
and
everything
indicated
that
the
boy
had
been
brought
alive
to
this
spot
from
a
considerable
distance
the
sides
of
the
grave
were
besmeared
with
the
blood
of
the
unfortunate
victim
indicating
that
the
tiger
had
tortured
it
just
as
a
cat
plays
with
a
mouse
as
long
as
it
remains
alive
in
the
lair
of
a
tiger
there
are
certain
terraces
or
places
under
overhanging
trees
which
are
covered
with
bones
and
are
evidently
spots
to
which
the
animal
brings
its
prey
to
be
devoured
on
such
a
terrace
one
will
find
the
remains
of
deer
wild
hog
dog
pig
porcupine
pangolin
and
other
animals
both
domestic
and
wild
a
fresh
kill
shows
that
with
its
tongue
the
tiger
licks
off
all
the
hair
of
its
prey
before
devouring
it
and
the
hair
will
be
found
in
a
circle
around
what
remains
of
the
kill
the
chinese
often
raid
a
lair
in
order
to
gather
up
the
quills
of
the
porcupine
and
the
bony
scales
of
the
pangolin
which
are
esteemed
for
medicinal
purposes
in
addition
to
the
larger
animals
tigers
feed
upon
reptiles
and
frogs
which
they
find
among
the
rice
fields
on
the
night
of
april
a
party
of
frog
catchers
were
returning
from
a
hunt
when
the
man
carrying
the
load
of
frogs
was
attacked
by
a
tiger
and
killed
the
animal
made
no
attempt
to
drag
the
man
away
and
it
would
appear
that
it
was
attracted
by
the
croaking
of
the
frogs
one
often
finds
trees
by
tigers
beside
some
trail
or
path
in
or
adjacent
to
a
lair
catlike
the
tiger
measures
its
full
length
upon
a
tree
standing
in
a
convenient
place
and
with
its
powerful
claws
rips
deeply
through
the
bark
this
sign
is
doubly
interesting
to
the
sportsman
as
it
not
only
indicates
the
presence
of
a
tiger
in
the
immediate
vicinity
but
serves
to
give
an
accurate
idea
as
to
the
size
of
the
beast
the
trails
leading
into
a
lair
often
are
marked
in
a
different
way
in
doing
this
the
animal
rakes
away
the
grass
with
a
forepaw
and
gathers
it
into
a
pile
but
claw
prints
never
appear
chapter
vii
the
blue
tiger
after
one
has
traveled
in
a
chinese
for
several
days
the
prospect
of
a
river
journey
is
not
very
alluring
but
we
had
a
most
agreeable
surprise
when
we
sailed
out
of
foochow
in
a
chartered
house
boat
to
hunt
the
blue
tiger
at
futsing
in
fact
we
had
all
the
luxury
of
a
private
yacht
for
our
boat
contained
a
large
central
cabin
with
a
table
and
chairs
and
two
staterooms
and
was
manned
by
a
captain
and
crew
of
six
men
all
for
per
day
in
the
evening
we
talked
of
the
blue
tiger
for
a
long
time
before
we
spread
our
beds
on
the
roof
of
the
boat
and
went
to
sleep
under
the
stars
we
left
the
boat
shortly
after
daylight
at
for
the
walk
to
to
my
great
surprise
the
coolies
were
considerably
distressed
at
the
lightness
of
our
loads
in
this
region
they
are
paid
by
weight
and
some
of
the
bearers
carry
almost
incredible
burdens
as
an
example
one
of
our
men
came
into
camp
swinging
a
trunk
on
each
end
of
his
pole
laughing
and
chatting
as
gayly
as
though
he
had
not
been
carrying
pounds
for
six
miles
under
a
broiling
sun
caldwell
chinese
hunter
lived
at
and
we
found
his
house
to
be
one
of
several
built
on
the
outskirts
of
a
beautiful
grove
of
gum
and
banyan
trees
although
it
was
exceptionally
clean
for
a
chinese
dwelling
we
pitched
our
tents
a
short
distance
away
at
first
we
were
somewhat
doubtful
about
sleeping
outside
but
after
one
night
indoors
we
decided
that
any
risk
was
preferable
to
spending
another
hour
in
the
stifling
heat
of
the
house
it
was
probable
that
a
tiger
would
be
so
suspicious
of
the
white
tents
that
it
would
not
attack
us
but
nevertheless
during
the
first
nights
we
were
rather
wakeful
and
more
than
once
at
some
strange
night
sound
seized
our
rifles
and
flashed
the
electric
lamp
into
the
darkness
tigers
often
come
into
this
village
only
a
few
hundred
yards
from
our
camp
site
in
a
tiger
had
rushed
into
the
house
of
one
of
the
peasants
and
attempted
to
steal
a
child
that
had
fallen
asleep
at
its
play
under
the
family
table
all
was
quiet
in
the
house
when
suddenly
the
animal
dashed
through
the
open
door
the
chinese
declare
that
the
gods
protected
the
infant
for
the
beast
missed
his
prey
and
seizing
the
leg
of
the
table
against
which
the
baby
head
was
resting
bolted
through
the
door
dragging
the
table
into
the
courtyard
this
was
the
work
of
the
famous
blue
tiger
which
we
had
come
to
hunt
and
which
had
on
two
occasions
been
seen
by
caldwell
the
first
time
he
heard
of
this
strange
beast
was
in
the
spring
of
the
animal
was
reported
as
having
been
seen
at
various
places
within
an
area
of
a
few
miles
almost
simultaneously
and
so
mysterious
were
its
movements
that
the
chinese
declared
it
was
a
spirit
of
the
devil
after
several
unsuccessful
hunts
caldwell
finally
saw
the
tiger
at
close
range
but
as
he
was
armed
with
only
a
shotgun
it
would
have
been
useless
to
shoot
his
second
view
of
the
beast
was
a
few
weeks
later
and
in
the
same
place
i
will
give
the
story
in
his
own
words
i
selected
a
spot
upon
a
hilltop
and
cleared
away
the
grass
and
ferns
with
a
for
a
place
to
tie
the
goat
i
concealed
myself
in
the
bushes
ten
feet
away
to
await
the
attack
but
the
unexpected
happened
and
the
tiger
approached
from
the
rear
when
i
first
saw
the
beast
he
was
moving
stealthily
along
a
little
trail
just
across
a
shallow
ravine
i
supposed
of
course
that
he
was
trying
to
locate
the
goat
which
was
bleating
loudly
but
to
my
horror
i
saw
that
he
was
creeping
upon
two
boys
who
had
entered
the
ravine
to
cut
grass
the
huge
brute
moved
along
for
a
few
yards
and
then
cautiously
lifted
his
head
above
the
grass
he
was
within
easy
springing
distance
when
i
raised
my
rifle
but
instantly
i
realized
that
if
i
wounded
the
animal
the
boys
would
certainly
meet
a
horrible
death
tigers
are
usually
afraid
of
the
human
voice
so
instead
of
firing
i
stepped
from
the
bushes
yelling
and
waving
my
arms
the
huge
cat
crouched
for
a
spring
drew
back
wavered
uncertainly
for
a
moment
and
then
slowly
slipped
away
into
the
grass
the
boys
were
saved
but
i
had
lost
the
opportunity
i
had
sought
for
over
a
year
however
i
had
again
seen
the
animal
about
which
so
many
strange
tales
had
been
told
the
markings
of
the
beast
are
strikingly
beautiful
the
ground
color
is
of
a
delicate
shade
of
maltese
changing
into
light
on
the
underparts
the
stripes
are
well
defined
and
like
those
of
the
ordinary
yellow
tiger
before
i
left
new
york
caldwell
had
written
me
repeatedly
urging
me
to
stop
at
futsing
on
the
way
to
to
try
with
him
for
the
blue
tiger
which
was
still
in
the
neighborhood
i
was
decidedly
skeptical
as
to
its
being
a
distinct
species
but
nevertheless
it
was
a
most
interesting
animal
and
would
certainly
be
well
worth
getting
i
believed
then
and
my
opinion
has
since
been
strengthened
that
it
is
a
partially
melanistic
phase
of
the
ordinary
yellow
tiger
black
leopards
are
common
in
india
and
the
malay
peninsula
and
as
only
a
single
individual
of
the
blue
tiger
has
been
reported
the
evidence
hardly
warrants
the
assumption
that
it
represents
a
distinct
species
we
hunted
the
animal
for
five
weeks
the
brute
ranged
in
the
vicinity
of
two
or
three
villages
about
seven
miles
apart
but
was
seen
most
frequently
near
he
was
as
elusive
as
a
will
o
the
wisp
killing
a
dog
or
goat
in
one
village
and
by
the
time
we
had
hurried
across
the
mountains
appearing
in
another
spot
a
few
miles
away
leaving
a
trail
of
terrified
natives
who
flocked
to
our
camp
to
recount
his
depredations
he
was
in
truth
the
great
invisible
and
it
seemed
impossible
that
we
should
not
get
him
sooner
or
later
but
we
never
did
once
we
missed
him
by
a
hair
breadth
through
sheer
bad
luck
and
it
was
only
by
exercising
almost
restraint
that
we
prevented
ourselves
from
doing
bodily
harm
to
the
three
chinese
who
ruined
our
hunt
every
evening
for
a
week
we
had
faithfully
taken
a
goat
into
the
long
ravine
for
the
blue
tiger
had
been
seen
several
times
near
this
lair
on
the
eighth
afternoon
we
were
in
the
blind
at
three
as
usual
we
had
tied
a
goat
to
a
tree
nearby
and
her
two
kids
were
but
a
few
feet
away
the
lair
lay
shimmering
in
the
breathless
heat
silent
save
for
the
echoes
of
the
bleating
goats
crouched
behind
the
screen
of
branches
for
three
long
hours
we
sat
in
the
patchwork
shade
motionless
dripping
with
perspiration
hardly
breathing
and
watched
the
shadows
steal
slowly
down
the
narrow
ravine
it
was
a
wild
place
which
seemed
to
have
been
cut
out
of
the
mountain
side
with
two
strokes
of
a
mighty
ax
and
was
choked
with
a
tangle
of
thorny
vines
and
sword
grass
impenetrable
as
a
wall
of
steel
the
only
entrance
was
by
the
tiger
tunnels
which
drove
their
twisting
way
through
the
murderous
growth
far
in
toward
its
gloomy
heart
the
shadows
had
passed
over
us
and
just
reached
a
lone
palm
tree
on
the
opposite
hillside
by
that
i
knew
it
was
six
and
in
half
an
hour
another
day
of
disappointment
would
be
ended
suddenly
at
the
left
and
just
below
us
there
came
the
faintest
crunching
sound
as
a
loose
stone
shifted
under
a
heavy
weight
then
a
rustling
in
the
grass
instantly
the
captive
goat
gave
a
shrill
bleat
of
terror
and
tugged
frantically
at
the
rope
which
held
it
to
the
tree
at
the
first
sound
harry
had
breathed
in
my
ear
get
ready
coming
i
was
half
kneeling
with
my
heavy
winchester
pushed
forward
and
the
hammer
up
the
blood
drummed
in
my
ears
and
my
neck
muscles
ached
with
the
strain
but
i
thanked
heaven
that
my
hands
were
steady
caldwell
sat
like
a
graven
image
the
stock
of
his
little
caliber
high
power
savage
nestling
against
his
cheek
our
eyes
met
for
an
instant
and
i
knew
in
that
glance
that
the
blue
tiger
would
never
make
another
charge
for
if
i
missed
him
harry
would
for
ten
minutes
we
waited
and
my
heart
lost
a
beat
when
twenty
feet
away
the
grass
began
to
move
again
but
rapidly
and
the
i
saw
harry
watching
the
lair
with
a
puzzled
look
which
changed
to
one
of
disgust
as
a
chorus
of
yells
sounded
across
the
ravine
and
three
chinese
wood
cutters
appeared
on
the
opposite
slope
they
were
taking
a
short
cut
home
shouting
to
drive
away
the
tigers
and
they
had
succeeded
only
too
well
for
the
blue
tiger
had
slipped
back
to
the
heart
of
the
lair
from
whence
he
had
come
he
had
been
nearly
ours
and
again
we
had
lost
him
i
felt
so
badly
that
i
could
not
even
swear
and
it
was
the
fact
that
harry
was
a
missionary
which
kept
me
from
it
either
caldwell
exclaimed
just
once
for
his
disappointment
was
even
more
bitter
than
mine
he
had
been
hunting
this
same
tiger
off
and
on
for
six
years
it
was
useless
for
us
to
wait
longer
that
evening
and
we
pushed
our
way
through
the
sword
grass
to
the
entrance
of
the
tunnel
down
which
the
tiger
had
come
there
in
the
soft
earth
were
the
great
footprints
where
he
had
crouched
at
the
entrance
to
take
a
cautious
survey
before
charging
into
the
open
as
we
looked
harry
suddenly
turned
to
me
and
said
roy
let
go
into
the
lair
there
is
just
one
chance
in
a
thousand
that
we
may
get
a
shot
now
i
must
admit
that
i
was
not
very
enthusiastic
about
that
little
excursion
but
in
we
went
crawling
on
our
hands
and
knees
up
the
narrow
passage
every
few
feet
we
passed
side
branches
from
the
main
tunnel
in
any
one
of
which
the
tiger
might
easily
have
been
lying
in
wait
and
could
have
killed
us
as
we
passed
it
was
a
foolhardy
thing
to
do
and
i
am
free
to
admit
that
i
was
scared
it
was
not
long
before
harry
twisted
about
and
said
roy
i
have
lost
any
tigers
in
here
let
get
out
and
out
we
came
faster
than
we
went
in
this
was
only
one
of
the
times
when
the
great
invisible
was
almost
in
our
hands
a
few
days
later
a
chinese
found
the
blue
tiger
asleep
under
a
rice
bank
early
in
the
afternoon
frightened
almost
to
death
he
ran
a
mile
and
a
half
to
our
camp
only
to
find
that
we
had
left
half
an
hour
before
for
another
village
where
the
brute
had
killed
two
wild
cats
early
in
the
morning
again
the
tiger
pushed
open
the
door
of
a
house
at
daybreak
just
as
the
members
of
the
family
were
getting
up
stole
a
dog
from
the
heaven
well
dragged
it
to
a
hillside
and
partly
devoured
it
we
were
in
camp
only
a
mile
away
and
our
chinese
hunters
found
the
carcass
on
a
narrow
ledge
in
the
sword
grass
high
up
on
the
mountain
side
the
spot
was
an
impossible
one
to
watch
and
we
set
a
huge
grizzly
bear
trap
which
had
been
carried
with
us
from
new
york
it
seemed
out
of
the
question
for
any
animal
to
return
to
the
carcass
of
the
dog
without
getting
caught
and
yet
the
tiger
did
it
with
his
hind
quarters
on
the
upper
terrace
he
dropped
down
stretched
his
long
neck
across
the
trap
seized
the
dog
which
had
been
wired
to
a
tree
and
pulled
it
away
it
was
evident
that
he
was
quite
unconscious
of
the
trap
for
his
fore
feet
had
actually
been
placed
upon
one
of
the
jaws
only
two
inches
from
the
pan
which
would
have
sprung
it
one
afternoon
we
responded
to
a
call
from
a
village
seven
miles
beyond
where
the
blue
tiger
had
been
seen
that
day
the
natives
assured
us
that
the
animal
continually
crossed
a
hill
thickly
clothed
with
pines
and
sword
grass
just
above
the
village
and
even
though
it
was
late
when
we
arrived
harry
thought
it
wise
to
set
the
trap
that
night
it
was
pitch
dark
before
we
reached
the
ridge
carrying
the
trap
two
lanterns
an
electric
and
a
wretched
little
dog
for
bait
we
had
been
engaged
for
about
fifteen
minutes
making
a
pen
for
the
dog
and
caldwell
and
i
were
on
our
knees
over
the
trap
when
suddenly
a
low
rumbling
growl
came
from
the
grass
not
twenty
feet
away
we
jumped
to
our
feet
just
as
it
sounded
again
this
time
ending
in
a
snarl
the
tiger
had
arrived
a
few
moments
too
early
and
we
were
in
the
rather
uncomfortable
position
of
having
to
return
to
the
village
by
way
of
a
narrow
trail
through
the
jungle
with
our
rifles
ready
and
the
electric
lamp
cutting
a
brilliant
path
in
the
darkness
we
walked
slowly
toward
the
edge
of
the
sword
grass
hoping
to
see
the
flash
of
the
eyes
but
the
beast
backed
off
beyond
the
range
of
the
light
into
an
impenetrable
tangle
where
we
could
not
follow
apparently
he
was
frightened
by
the
lantern
for
we
did
not
hear
him
again
after
nearly
a
month
of
disappointments
such
as
these
heller
joined
us
at
with
kellogg
caldwell
thought
it
advisable
to
shift
camp
to
the
monastery
about
twelve
miles
away
where
he
had
once
spent
a
summer
with
his
family
and
had
killed
several
tigers
this
was
within
the
blue
tiger
range
and
moreover
had
the
advantage
of
offering
a
better
general
collecting
ground
than
thus
with
heller
to
look
after
the
small
mammals
we
could
begin
to
make
our
time
count
for
something
if
we
did
not
get
the
tiger
is
a
beautiful
temple
or
rather
series
of
temples
built
into
a
hillside
at
the
end
of
a
long
narrow
valley
which
swells
out
like
a
great
bowl
between
bamboo
clothed
mountains
two
thousand
feet
in
height
on
his
former
visit
caldwell
had
made
friends
with
the
head
priest
and
we
were
allowed
to
establish
ourselves
upon
the
broad
porch
of
the
third
and
highest
building
it
was
an
ideal
place
for
a
collecting
camp
and
would
have
been
delightful
except
for
the
terrible
heat
which
was
rendered
doubly
disagreeable
by
the
almost
continual
rain
the
priests
who
shuffled
about
the
temples
were
a
hard
lot
most
of
them
were
fugitives
from
justice
and
certainly
looked
the
part
for
a
more
disreputable
diseased
and
generally
undesirable
body
of
men
i
have
never
seen
our
stay
at
was
productive
and
the
temple
life
interesting
we
slept
on
the
porch
and
each
morning
about
half
an
hour
before
daylight
the
measured
strokes
of
a
great
gong
sounded
from
the
temple
just
below
us
boom
boom
it
went
then
rapidly
bang
it
was
a
religious
alarm
clock
to
rouse
the
world
a
little
later
when
the
upturned
gables
and
twisted
dolphins
on
the
roof
had
begun
to
take
definite
shape
in
the
gray
light
of
the
new
day
the
gong
boomed
out
again
doors
creaked
and
from
their
rooms
shuffled
the
priests
to
yawn
and
stretch
themselves
before
the
early
service
the
droning
chorus
of
hoarse
voices
swelling
in
a
meaningless
chant
harmonized
strangely
with
the
romantic
surroundings
of
the
temple
and
become
our
daily
and
evensong
illustration
the
monastery
illustration
a
priest
of
at
the
first
gong
we
slipped
from
beneath
our
mosquito
nets
and
dressed
to
be
ready
for
the
bats
which
fluttered
into
the
building
to
hide
themselves
beneath
the
tiles
and
rafters
when
daylight
had
fully
come
we
scattered
to
the
four
winds
of
heaven
to
inspect
traps
hunt
barking
deer
or
collect
birds
but
gathered
again
at
nine
for
breakfast
and
to
deposit
our
spoil
caldwell
and
i
always
spent
the
afternoon
at
the
blue
tiger
lair
but
the
animal
had
suddenly
shifted
his
operations
back
to
and
did
not
appear
at
while
we
were
there
our
work
in
fukien
taught
us
much
that
may
be
of
help
to
other
naturalists
who
contemplate
a
visit
to
this
province
we
satisfied
ourselves
that
summer
collecting
is
impracticable
for
the
heat
is
so
intense
and
the
vegetation
so
heavy
that
only
meager
results
can
be
obtained
for
the
efforts
expended
continual
tramping
over
the
mountains
in
the
blazing
sun
necessarily
must
have
its
effect
upon
the
strongest
constitution
and
even
a
man
like
caldwell
who
has
become
thoroughly
acclimated
is
not
immune
both
caldwell
and
i
lost
from
fifteen
to
twenty
pounds
in
weight
during
the
time
we
hunted
the
blue
tiger
and
each
of
us
had
serious
trouble
from
abscesses
i
have
never
worked
in
a
more
trying
climate
even
that
of
borneo
and
the
dutch
east
indies
where
i
collected
in
was
much
less
debilitating
than
fukien
in
the
summer
the
average
temperature
was
about
degrees
in
the
shade
but
the
humidity
was
so
high
that
one
felt
as
though
one
were
wrapped
in
a
wet
blanket
and
even
during
a
six
weeks
rainless
period
the
air
was
saturated
with
moisture
from
the
in
winter
the
weather
is
raw
and
damp
but
collecting
then
would
be
vastly
easier
than
in
summer
not
only
on
account
of
climatic
conditions
but
because
much
of
the
vegetation
disappears
and
there
is
an
opportunity
for
still
hunting
trapping
for
small
mammal
is
especially
difficult
because
of
the
dense
population
the
mud
dykes
and
the
rice
fields
usually
are
covered
with
tracks
of
civets
mongooses
and
cats
which
come
to
hunt
frogs
or
fish
but
if
a
trap
is
set
it
either
catches
a
chinaman
or
promptly
is
stolen
moreover
the
small
mammals
are
neither
abundant
nor
varied
in
number
of
species
and
the
larger
forms
such
as
tiger
leopard
wild
pig
and
serow
are
exceedingly
difficult
to
kill
while
our
work
in
the
province
was
done
during
an
unfavorable
season
and
in
only
two
localities
yet
enough
was
seen
of
the
general
conditions
to
make
it
certain
that
a
thorough
zoölogical
study
of
the
region
would
require
considerable
time
and
hard
work
and
that
the
results
so
far
as
a
large
collection
of
mammals
is
concerned
would
not
be
highly
satisfactory
work
in
the
western
part
of
the
province
among
the
bohea
hills
undoubtedly
would
be
more
profitable
but
even
there
it
would
be
hardly
worth
while
for
an
expedition
with
limited
time
and
money
bird
life
is
on
a
much
better
footing
but
the
ornithology
of
fukien
already
has
received
considerable
attention
through
the
collections
of
swinhoe
la
touche
styan
ricketts
caldwell
and
others
and
probably
not
a
great
number
of
species
remain
to
be
described
much
work
could
still
be
done
upon
the
herpetology
of
the
region
however
and
i
believe
that
this
branch
of
zoölogy
would
be
well
worth
investigation
for
reptiles
and
batrachians
are
fairly
abundant
and
the
natives
would
rather
assist
than
retard
one
efforts
the
language
of
fukien
is
a
greater
annoyance
than
in
any
other
of
the
chinese
coast
provinces
the
foochow
dialect
which
is
one
of
the
most
difficult
to
learn
is
spoken
only
within
fifty
or
one
hundred
miles
of
the
city
at
caldwell
who
speaks
foochow
perfectly
could
not
understand
a
word
of
the
southern
mandarin
which
is
the
language
of
that
region
and
near
futsing
where
a
colony
of
natives
from
amoy
have
settled
the
dialect
is
unintelligible
to
one
who
knows
only
foochow
travel
in
fukien
is
an
unceasing
trial
for
transport
is
entirely
by
coolies
who
carry
from
eighty
to
one
hundred
pounds
the
men
are
paid
by
distance
or
weight
therefore
when
coolies
finally
have
been
obtained
there
is
the
inevitable
wrangling
over
loads
so
that
from
one
to
two
hours
are
consumed
before
the
party
can
start
but
the
worst
of
it
is
that
one
can
never
be
certain
when
one
entire
outfit
will
arrive
at
its
new
destination
some
men
walk
much
faster
than
others
some
will
delay
a
long
time
for
tea
or
may
give
out
altogether
if
the
day
be
hot
with
the
result
that
the
last
load
will
arrive
perhaps
five
or
six
hours
after
the
first
one
as
horses
are
not
to
be
had
if
one
does
not
walk
the
only
alternative
is
to
be
carried
in
a
mountain
chair
which
is
an
uncomfortable
affair
and
only
to
be
found
along
the
main
highways
on
the
whole
transport
by
in
china
is
so
uncertain
and
expensive
that
for
a
large
expedition
it
forms
a
grave
obstacle
to
successful
work
if
time
and
funds
be
limited
on
the
other
hand
servants
are
cheap
and
usually
good
we
employed
a
very
fair
cook
who
received
monthly
seven
dollars
mexican
then
about
three
and
dollars
gold
and
boys
were
hired
at
from
five
to
seven
dollars
mexican
as
none
of
the
servants
knew
english
they
could
be
obtained
at
much
lower
wages
but
cooks
usually
receive
from
fifteen
to
twenty
dollars
mexican
a
month
it
was
hard
to
leave
fukien
without
the
blue
tiger
but
we
had
hunted
him
unsuccessfully
for
five
weeks
and
there
was
other
and
more
important
work
awaiting
us
in
it
required
thirty
porters
to
transport
our
baggage
from
the
monastery
to
miles
away
where
two
houseboats
were
to
meet
us
and
by
ten
in
the
evening
we
were
lying
off
pagoda
anchorage
awaiting
the
flood
tide
to
take
us
to
foochow
we
made
our
beds
on
the
deck
house
and
in
the
morning
opened
our
eyes
to
find
the
boat
tied
to
the
wharf
at
the
custom
house
on
the
bund
and
ourselves
in
full
view
of
all
foochow
had
it
been
awake
at
that
hour
the
week
of
packing
and
repacking
that
followed
was
made
easy
for
us
by
claude
kellogg
who
acted
as
our
ministering
angel
i
think
there
must
be
a
special
providence
that
watches
over
wandering
naturalists
and
directs
them
to
such
men
as
kellogg
for
without
divine
aid
they
could
never
be
found
when
we
last
saw
him
he
stood
on
the
stone
steps
of
the
water
front
waving
his
hat
as
we
slipped
away
on
the
tide
to
board
the
for
hongkong
chapter
viii
the
women
of
china
the
schools
for
native
girls
at
foochow
and
interested
us
greatly
even
when
we
first
came
to
china
but
we
could
not
appreciate
then
as
we
did
later
the
step
toward
civilization
of
these
institutions
how
much
the
missionaries
are
able
to
accomplish
from
a
religious
standpoint
is
a
question
which
we
do
not
wish
to
discuss
but
no
one
who
has
ever
lived
among
them
can
deny
that
the
opening
of
schools
and
the
diffusing
of
western
knowledge
are
potent
factors
in
the
development
of
the
people
the
chinese
were
not
slow
even
in
the
beginning
to
see
the
advantages
of
a
foreign
education
for
their
boys
and
now
along
the
coast
at
least
some
are
beginning
to
make
sacrifices
for
their
daughters
as
well
the
woman
college
which
was
opened
recently
in
foochow
is
one
of
the
finest
buildings
of
the
republic
and
when
one
sees
its
girls
dressed
in
their
quaint
little
garments
it
is
difficult
to
realize
that
outside
such
schools
they
are
still
slaves
in
mind
and
body
to
those
iron
rules
of
confucius
which
have
molded
the
entire
structure
of
chinese
society
for
over
years
the
position
of
women
in
china
today
and
the
rules
which
govern
the
household
of
every
orthodox
chinese
are
the
direct
heritage
of
confucianism
the
following
translation
by
professor
legge
from
the
of
the
confucian
chapter
is
illuminating
confucius
said
man
is
the
representative
of
heaven
and
is
supreme
over
all
things
woman
yields
obedience
to
the
instructions
of
man
and
helps
to
carry
out
his
principles
on
this
account
she
can
determine
nothing
of
herself
and
is
subject
to
the
rule
of
the
three
obediences
when
young
she
must
obey
her
father
and
her
elder
brother
when
married
she
must
obey
her
husband
when
her
husband
is
dead
she
must
obey
her
son
she
may
not
think
of
marrying
a
second
time
no
instructions
or
orders
must
issue
from
the
harem
women
business
is
simply
the
preparation
and
supplying
of
drink
and
food
beyond
the
threshold
of
her
apartments
she
shall
not
be
known
for
evil
or
for
good
she
may
not
cross
the
boundaries
of
a
state
to
attend
a
funeral
she
may
take
no
steps
on
her
own
motive
and
may
come
to
no
conclusion
on
her
own
deliberation
the
grounds
for
divorce
as
stated
by
confucius
are
disobedience
to
her
husband
parents
not
giving
birth
to
a
son
dissolute
conduct
jealousy
of
her
husband
attentions
to
the
other
inmates
of
his
harem
talkativeness
and
thieving
a
chinese
bride
owes
implicit
obedience
to
her
and
as
she
is
often
reared
by
her
husband
family
or
else
married
to
him
as
a
mere
child
and
is
under
the
complete
control
of
his
mother
for
a
considerable
period
of
her
existence
her
life
in
many
instances
is
one
of
intolerable
misery
there
is
generally
little
or
no
consideration
for
a
girl
under
the
best
of
circumstances
until
she
becomes
the
mother
of
a
male
child
her
condition
then
improves
but
she
approaches
happiness
only
when
she
in
turn
occupies
the
enviable
position
of
it
is
difficult
to
imagine
a
life
of
greater
dreariness
and
vacuity
than
that
of
the
average
chinese
woman
owing
to
her
bound
feet
and
resultant
helplessness
if
she
is
not
obliged
to
work
she
rarely
stirs
from
the
narrow
confinement
of
her
courtyard
and
perhaps
in
her
entire
life
she
may
not
go
a
mile
from
the
house
to
which
she
was
brought
a
bride
except
for
the
periodical
visits
to
her
father
home
it
has
been
aptly
said
that
there
are
no
real
homes
in
china
and
it
is
not
surprising
that
ignored
and
despised
for
centuries
the
chinese
woman
shows
no
ability
to
improve
the
squalor
of
her
surroundings
she
passes
her
life
in
a
dark
dwelling
with
broken
furniture
and
a
mud
floor
together
with
pigs
chickens
and
babies
enjoying
a
limited
sphere
of
action
under
the
tables
and
chairs
or
in
the
courtyard
without
her
work
is
actually
never
done
and
a
chinese
bride
bright
and
attractive
at
twenty
will
be
old
and
faded
at
thirty
but
without
doubt
the
crowning
evil
which
attends
woman
condition
in
china
is
foot
binding
and
nothing
can
be
offered
in
extenuation
of
this
abominable
custom
it
is
said
to
have
originated
one
thousand
years
before
the
christian
era
and
has
persisted
until
the
present
day
in
spite
of
the
efforts
directed
against
it
the
empress
dowager
issued
edicts
strongly
advising
its
discontinuation
the
natural
foot
society
which
was
formed
about
fifteen
years
ago
has
endeavored
to
educate
public
opinion
and
the
missionaries
refuse
to
admit
girls
so
mutilated
to
their
schools
but
nevertheless
the
reform
has
made
little
progress
beyond
the
coast
cities
precedent
and
the
fear
of
not
obtaining
suitable
husbands
for
their
daughters
are
responsible
for
the
continuation
of
the
evil
and
it
is
estimated
that
there
are
still
about
millions
of
girls
and
women
who
are
crippled
in
this
way
the
feet
are
bandaged
between
the
ages
of
five
and
seven
the
toes
are
bent
under
the
sole
of
the
foot
and
after
two
or
three
years
the
heel
and
instep
are
so
forced
together
that
a
dollar
can
be
placed
in
the
cleft
gradually
also
the
lower
limbs
shrink
away
until
only
the
bones
remain
the
suffering
of
the
children
is
intense
we
often
passed
through
streets
full
of
laughing
boys
and
tiny
girls
where
others
a
few
years
older
were
sitting
on
the
doorsteps
or
curbstones
holding
their
tortured
feet
and
crying
bitterly
in
some
instances
are
constructed
a
considerable
distance
from
the
family
dwelling
where
the
girls
must
sleep
during
their
first
crippled
years
in
order
that
their
moans
may
not
disturb
the
other
members
of
the
family
the
child
only
relief
is
to
hang
her
feet
over
the
edge
of
the
bed
in
order
to
stop
the
circulation
and
induce
numbness
or
to
seek
oblivion
from
opium
if
the
custom
were
a
fad
which
affected
only
the
wealthy
classes
it
would
be
reprehensible
enough
but
it
curses
rich
and
poor
alike
and
almost
every
day
we
saw
heavily
laden
coolie
women
steadying
themselves
by
means
of
a
staff
hobbling
along
the
roads
or
laboring
in
the
fields
illustration

class

feet
although
the
agitation
against
foot
binding
is
undoubtedly
making
itself
felt
to
a
certain
extent
in
the
coast
provinces
in
the
horrible
practice
continues
unabated
during
the
year
in
which
we
traveled
through
a
large
part
of
the
province
wherever
there
were
chinese
we
saw
bound
feet
and
the
fact
that
virtually
girl
over
eight
years
old
was
mutilated
in
this
way
is
satisfactory
evidence
that
reform
ideas
have
not
penetrated
to
this
remote
part
of
the
republic
i
know
of
nothing
which
so
rouses
one
indignation
because
of
its
senselessness
and
brutality
and
china
can
never
hope
to
take
her
place
among
civilized
nations
until
she
has
abandoned
this
barbarous
custom
and
liberated
her
women
from
their
infamous
subjection
there
has
been
much
criticism
of
foreign
education
because
the
girls
who
have
had
its
advantages
absorb
western
ideas
so
completely
that
they
dislike
to
return
to
their
homes
where
the
ordinary
conditions
of
a
chinese
household
exist
nevertheless
if
the
women
of
china
are
ever
to
be
emancipated
it
must
come
through
their
own
education
as
well
as
that
of
the
men
one
of
the
first
results
of
foreign
influence
is
to
delay
marriage
and
in
some
instances
the
early
betrothal
with
its
attendant
miseries
the
evil
which
results
from
this
custom
can
hardly
be
overestimated
it
happens
not
infrequently
that
two
children
are
betrothed
in
infancy
the
respective
families
being
in
like
circumstances
at
the
time
the
opportunity
perhaps
is
offered
to
the
girl
to
attend
school
and
she
may
even
go
through
college
but
an
inexorable
custom
brings
her
back
to
her
parents
home
forces
her
to
submit
to
the
engagement
made
in
babyhood
and
perhaps
ruins
her
life
through
marriage
with
a
man
of
no
higher
social
status
or
intelligence
than
a
coolie
among
the
few
girls
imbued
with
western
civilization
a
spirit
of
revolt
is
slowly
growing
and
while
it
is
impossible
for
them
to
break
down
the
barriers
of
ages
yet
in
many
instances
they
waive
aside
what
would
seem
an
unsurmountable
precedent
and
insist
upon
having
some
voice
in
the
choosing
of
their
husbands
while
in
we
were
invited
to
attend
the
wedding
of
a
girl
who
had
been
brought
up
in
the
woman
school
and
who
was
qualified
to
be
a
bible
woman
or
native
christian
teacher
it
was
whispered
that
she
had
actually
met
her
betrothed
on
several
occasions
but
on
their
wedding
day
no
trace
of
recognition
was
visible
and
the
marriage
was
performed
with
all
the
punctilious
chinese
observances
compatible
with
a
christian
ceremony
precedent
required
of
this
little
bride
although
she
might
have
been
radiantly
happy
at
heart
and
undoubtedly
was
to
appear
tearful
and
shrinking
and
as
she
was
escorted
up
the
aisle
by
her
bridesmaid
one
might
have
thought
she
was
being
led
to
slaughter
white
is
not
becoming
to
the
chinese
and
besides
it
is
a
sign
of
mourning
so
she
had
chosen
pink
for
her
wedding
gown
and
had
a
brilliant
pink
veil
over
her
carefully
oiled
hair
after
the
ceremony
the
bride
and
bridegroom
proceeded
downstairs
to
the
joyous
strain
of
the
wedding
march
but
with
nothing
joyous
in
their
demeanor
in
fact
they
appeared
like
two
wooden
images
at
the
reception
and
endured
for
over
an
hour
the
stares
and
loud
criticism
of
the
guests
he
assumed
during
the
ordeal
a
look
of
bored
indifference
while
the
little
bride
sat
with
her
head
bowed
on
her
breast
apparently
terror
stricken
but
once
she
raised
her
face
and
i
saw
a
merry
twinkle
in
her
shining
black
eyes
that
made
me
realize
that
perhaps
it
all
quite
so
frightful
as
she
would
have
us
believe
i
often
wonder
what
sort
of
a
life
she
is
leading
in
her
far
away
chinese
courtyard
chapter
ix
voyaging
to
we
had
a
busy
week
in
hongkong
outfitting
for
our
trip
to
hongkong
is
one
of
the
best
cities
in
the
orient
in
which
to
purchase
supplies
of
almost
any
kind
for
not
only
is
the
selection
excellent
but
the
best
english
goods
can
be
had
for
prices
very
little
in
excess
of
those
in
london
itself
the
system
which
we
used
in
our
commissary
was
that
of
the
unit
food
box
which
has
been
adopted
by
most
large
expeditions
the
boxes
were
packed
to
weigh
seventy
pounds
each
and
contained
all
the
necessary
staple
supplies
for
three
persons
for
one
week
thus
only
one
box
needed
to
be
opened
at
a
time
and
moreover
if
the
party
separated
for
a
few
days
a
single
box
could
be
taken
without
the
necessity
of
repacking
and
with
the
assurance
that
sufficient
food
would
be
available
our
supplies
consisted
largely
of
flour
butter
sugar
coffee
milk
bacon
and
marmalade
and
but
little
tinned
meat
vegetables
or
fruit
because
we
were
certain
to
be
able
to
obtain
a
plentiful
supply
of
such
food
in
the
country
through
which
we
were
expecting
to
travel
our
tents
were
brought
from
new
york
and
were
made
of
light
egyptian
cotton
thoroughly
waterproof
but
we
also
purchased
in
hongkong
a
large
army
tent
for
the
servants
and
two
canvas
flies
to
protect
loads
and
specimens
we
used
sleeping
bags
and
folding
cots
tables
and
chairs
for
when
an
expedition
expects
to
remain
in
the
field
for
a
long
time
it
is
absolutely
necessary
to
be
as
comfortable
as
possible
and
to
live
well
otherwise
one
can
not
work
at
one
highest
efficiency
for
clothing
we
all
wore
khaki
or
suits
with
flannel
shirts
and
high
leather
shoes
for
mountain
climbing
and
we
had
light
rubber
automobile
shirts
and
rubber
caps
for
use
in
rainy
weather
the
auto
shirt
is
a
long
loose
robe
which
slips
over
the
head
and
fastens
about
the
neck
and
when
one
is
sitting
upon
a
horse
can
be
so
spread
about
as
to
cover
all
exposed
parts
of
the
body
it
is
especially
useful
and
necessary
and
hip
rubber
boots
are
also
very
comfortable
during
the
rainy
season
our
traps
for
catching
small
mammals
were
brought
from
new
york
we
had
two
sizes
of
wooden
out
of
sight
for
mice
and
rats
and
four
or
five
sizes
of
oneida
steel
traps
for
catching
medium
sized
animals
such
as
civets
and
polecats
we
also
carried
a
half
dozen
no
wolf
traps
heller
had
used
this
size
in
africa
and
found
that
they
were
large
enough
even
to
hold
lions
heller
carried
a
savage
rifle
while
i
used
a
mm
mannlicher
and
a
winchester
all
of
these
guns
were
eminently
satisfactory
but
the
choice
of
a
rifle
is
a
very
personal
matter
and
every
sportsman
has
his
favorite
weapon
we
found
however
that
a
flat
trajectory
rifle
such
as
those
with
which
we
were
armed
was
absolutely
essential
for
many
of
our
shots
were
at
long
range
and
we
frequently
killed
gorals
at
three
hundred
yards
or
over
the
camera
equipment
consisted
of
two
kodaks
a
graphic
tripod
camera
and
graflex
for
rapid
work
we
have
found
after
considerable
field
experience
that
the
is
the
most
convenient
size
to
handle
for
the
plate
is
large
enough
and
can
be
obtained
more
readily
than
any
other
in
different
parts
of
the
world
the
same
applies
to
the
kodak
size
film
for
there
are
few
places
where
foreign
goods
are
carried
that
films
can
not
be
purchased
all
of
our
plates
and
films
were
sealed
in
tin
boxes
before
we
left
america
and
thus
the
material
was
in
perfect
condition
when
the
cans
were
opened
we
used
plates
almost
altogether
in
the
finer
photographic
work
for
although
they
are
heavier
and
more
difficult
to
handle
than
films
nevertheless
the
results
obtained
are
very
superior
a
collapsible
rubber
dark
room
about
seven
feet
high
and
four
feet
in
diameter
was
an
indispensable
part
of
the
camera
equipment
this
tent
was
made
for
us
by
the
abercrombie
fitch
company
of
new
york
and
could
be
hung
from
the
limb
of
a
tree
or
the
rafters
of
a
building
and
be
ready
for
use
in
five
minutes
the
motion
pictures
were
taken
with
a
universal
camera
and
like
all
other
negatives
were
developed
in
the
field
by
means
of
a
special
apparatus
which
had
been
designed
by
carl
akeley
of
the
american
museum
of
natural
history
this
work
required
a
much
larger
space
than
that
of
the
portable
dark
room
and
we
consequently
had
a
tent
made
of
red
cloth
which
could
be
tied
inside
of
our
ordinary
sleeping
tent
our
equipment
was
packed
in
fiber
army
trunks
and
in
wooden
boxes
with
sliding
tops
the
latter
arrangement
is
especially
desirable
in
for
the
loads
can
be
opened
without
being
untied
from
the
saddle
thus
saving
a
considerable
amount
of
time
and
trouble
it
was
by
no
means
an
easy
matter
to
get
our
supplies
together
but
the
lane
crawford
company
of
hongkong
pushed
the
making
and
packing
of
our
boxes
in
a
remarkably
efficient
manner
as
the
manager
of
one
of
their
departments
expressed
it
the
one
way
to
hurry
a
chinaman
is
to
get
more
chinamen
and
they
put
a
small
army
at
work
upon
our
material
which
was
ready
for
shipment
in
just
a
week
while
in
hongkong
we
were
joined
by
wu
of
shanghai
who
acted
as
interpreter
and
head
boy
as
well
as
a
general
field
manager
of
the
expedition
he
formerly
had
been
in
the
employ
of
cary
when
the
latter
was
commissioner
of
customs
in
and
he
was
educated
at
the
college
of
foochow
wu
proved
to
be
the
most
efficient
and
trustworthy
servant
whom
we
have
ever
employed
and
the
success
of
our
work
was
due
in
no
small
degree
to
his
efforts
we
left
for
tonking
on
the
commanded
by
harry
trowbridge
a
congenial
and
gentleman
whose
delightful
personality
contributed
much
toward
making
our
week
stay
on
his
ship
most
pleasant
on
our
way
to
haiphong
the
vessel
stopped
at
the
island
of
hainan
and
anchored
about
three
miles
off
the
town
of
this
island
is
by
miles
long
is
mountainous
in
its
center
but
flat
and
uninteresting
at
the
northwest
a
large
part
of
the
island
is
unexplored
and
in
the
interior
there
is
a
mountain
called
the
five
fingers
which
has
never
been
ascended
for
it
is
reported
that
the
hill
tribes
are
unfriendly
and
that
the
tropical
valleys
are
reeking
with
deadly
malaria
the
island
undoubtedly
would
prove
to
be
a
rich
field
for
zoölogical
work
as
is
shown
by
the
collections
which
the
american
museum
of
natural
history
has
already
received
from
a
native
dealer
these
include
monkeys
squirrels
and
other
small
mammals
and
bears
leopards
and
deer
are
said
to
be
among
its
fauna
the
next
night
steaming
brought
us
to
the
city
of
on
the
mainland
in
the
afternoon
we
went
ashore
with
captain
trowbridge
to
visit
bradley
of
the
china
inland
mission
who
is
in
charge
of
a
leper
hospital
which
is
a
model
of
its
kind
the
doctor
was
away
but
we
made
ourselves
at
home
and
when
he
returned
he
found
us
in
his
drawing
room
comfortably
enjoying
afternoon
tea
he
remarked
that
he
knew
of
a
chinese
cook
who
was
looking
for
a
position
and
half
an
hour
later
while
we
were
watching
some
remarkably
fine
tennis
the
cook
arrived
he
was
about
six
feet
two
inches
high
and
so
thin
that
he
was
immediately
christened
the
woolworth
building
and
although
not
a
very
prepossessing
looking
individual
he
was
forthwith
engaged
principally
because
of
his
ability
to
speak
english
this
was
at
six
in
the
afternoon
and
we
had
to
be
aboard
the
ship
at
eight
the
doctor
sent
a
note
to
the
french
consul
and
the
cook
returned
anon
with
his
baggage
and
passport
obtaining
this
cook
was
the
only
really
rapid
thing
which
i
have
ever
seen
done
in
china
when
the
arrived
in
haiphong
the
next
afternoon
we
were
besieged
by
a
screaming
fighting
mob
of
annamits
who
seized
upon
our
baggage
like
so
many
vultures
and
it
was
only
by
means
of
a
few
kicks
that
we
could
prevent
it
from
being
scattered
to
the
four
winds
of
heaven
after
we
had
designated
a
to
receive
our
equipment
the
unloading
began
and
several
trunks
had
gone
over
the
side
when
heller
happened
to
glance
down
just
in
time
to
see
one
of
the
ammunition
boxes
drop
into
the
water
and
sink
like
lead
the
annamits
believing
that
it
had
not
been
noticed
went
on
as
blithely
as
before
and
volubly
denied
that
anything
had
been
lost
we
stopped
the
unloading
instantly
and
sent
for
divers
the
box
had
sunk
in
thirty
feet
of
muddy
water
and
it
seemed
useless
to
hope
that
it
could
ever
be
recovered
but
the
divers
went
to
work
by
dropping
a
heavy
stone
on
the
end
of
a
rope
and
going
down
it
hand
over
hand
after
two
hours
the
box
was
located
and
brought
dripping
to
the
surface
fortunately
but
little
of
the
ammunition
was
ruined
and
most
of
it
was
dried
during
the
night
in
the
engine
room
because
of
this
delay
we
had
to
leave
haiphong
on
the
following
day
and
with
captain
trowbridge
we
went
by
train
to
hanoi
the
capital
of
the
colony
hanoi
is
a
city
of
delightful
surprises
it
has
broad
clean
streets
overhung
with
trees
which
often
form
a
cool
green
canopy
overhead
beautiful
lawns
and
houses
and
in
the
center
of
the
town
is
a
lovely
lake
surrounded
by
a
wide
border
of
palms
at
the
far
end
like
a
jewel
in
a
crystal
setting
seems
to
float
a
white
pagoda
an
outpost
of
the
temple
which
stands
in
the
midst
of
a
watery
meadow
of
lotus
plants
the
city
shops
are
excellent
but
in
most
instances
the
prices
are
exceedingly
high
like
all
the
french
towns
in
the
orient
the
hours
for
work
are
rather
confusing
to
the
foreigner
the
shops
open
at
in
the
morning
and
close
at
to
reopen
again
at
in
the
afternoon
and
continue
business
until
or
in
the
evening
during
the
middle
of
the
day
all
houses
have
the
shutters
closely
drawn
and
because
of
the
intense
heat
and
glare
of
the
sun
the
streets
are
absolutely
deserted
not
even
a
native
being
visible
in
the
morning
a
remarkable
especially
for
its
petitness
is
served
and
a
real
comes
later
anywhere
from
to
about
in
the
evening
the
open
and
restaurants
along
the
sidewalk
are
lined
with
groups
of
men
and
women
playing
cards
and
dice
and
drinking
gin
and
bitters
vermouth
or
absinthe
there
is
an
air
of
happiness
and
life
about
hanoi
which
is
typically
parisian
and
even
during
war
time
it
is
a
city
of
gayety
an
immense
theater
stands
in
the
center
of
the
town
but
has
not
been
opened
since
the
beginning
of
the
war
we
had
letters
to
chemin
dupontès
the
director
of
the
railroads
as
well
as
to
the
and
other
officials
without
exception
we
were
received
in
the
most
cordial
manner
and
every
facility
and
convenience
put
at
our
disposal
dupontès
was
especially
helpful
some
time
before
our
arrival
a
tunnel
on
the
railroad
from
hanoi
to
fu
had
caved
in
and
for
almost
a
month
trains
had
not
been
running
it
was
now
in
operation
however
but
all
luggage
had
to
be
transferred
by
hand
at
the
broken
tunnel
and
consequently
must
not
exceed
pounds
in
weight
this
meant
repacking
our
entire
equipment
and
three
days
of
hard
work
dupontès
arranged
to
have
our
pounds
of
baggage
put
in
a
special
third
class
carriage
with
our
boys
in
attendance
and
in
this
way
saved
the
expedition
a
considerable
amount
of
money
he
personally
went
with
us
to
the
station
to
arrange
for
our
comfort
with
the
de
telegraphed
ahead
at
every
station
upon
the
railroad
and
gave
us
an
open
letter
to
all
officials
in
fact
there
was
nothing
which
he
left
undone
the
railroad
is
a
remarkable
engineering
achievement
for
it
was
constructed
in
great
haste
through
a
difficult
mountainous
range
is
an
exceedingly
rich
province
and
the
french
were
quick
to
see
the
advantages
of
drawing
its
vast
trade
to
their
own
seaports
the
british
were
already
making
surveys
to
construct
a
railroad
from
bhamo
on
the
headwaters
of
the
irawadi
river
across
to
connect
with
the
yangtze
and
the
french
were
anxious
to
have
their
road
in
operation
some
time
before
the
rival
line
could
be
completed
owing
to
its
hasty
construction
and
the
heavy
rainfall
or
perhaps
to
both
the
tunnels
and
bridges
frequently
cave
in
or
are
washed
away
and
the
railroad
is
chiefly
remarkable
for
the
number
of
days
in
the
year
in
which
it
does
not
operate
nevertheless
the
french
deserve
great
credit
for
their
enterprise
in
extending
their
line
to
fu
over
the
mountains
where
there
is
a
tunnel
or
bridge
almost
every
mile
of
the
way
while
it
was
being
built
through
the
jungles
of
tonking
the
coolies
died
like
flies
and
it
was
necessary
to
suspend
all
work
during
the
summer
months
the
scenery
along
the
railroad
is
marvelous
and
the
traveling
is
by
no
means
uncomfortable
but
the
hotels
in
which
one
stops
at
night
are
wretched
one
of
our
friends
in
hongkong
related
an
amusing
experience
which
he
had
at
the
first
hotel
on
the
railroad
he
asked
for
a
bath
and
discovered
that
a
tub
of
hot
water
had
been
prepared
he
wished
a
cold
bath
and
seeing
a
large
tank
filled
with
cold
water
in
the
corner
of
the
room
he
climbed
in
and
was
enjoying
himself
when
the
hotel
proprietor
suddenly
rushed
upstairs
exclaiming
mon
dieu
mon
dieu
you
are
in
the
tank
of
drinking
water
when
we
arrived
at
fu
we
found
a
surprisingly
cosmopolitan
community
housed
within
its
grim
old
walls
some
were
consuls
some
missionaries
some
salt
telegraph
or
customs
officials
in
the
chinese
employ
and
others
represented
business
firms
in
hongkong
but
all
received
us
with
hospitality
characteristic
of
the
east
we
thought
that
after
leaving
hongkong
our
evening
clothes
would
not
again
be
used
but
they
were
requisitioned
every
night
for
we
were
guests
at
dinners
given
by
almost
everyone
of
the
foreign
community
howard
page
a
representative
of
the
standard
oil
company
proved
a
most
valuable
friend
and
through
him
we
were
able
to
obtain
a
caravan
and
make
other
arrangements
for
the
transportation
of
our
baggage
henry
wilden
the
french
consul
an
ardent
sportsman
and
a
charming
gentleman
took
an
active
interest
in
our
affairs
and
arranged
a
meeting
for
us
with
the
chinese
commissioner
of
foreign
affairs
moreover
he
later
transported
our
trunks
to
hongkong
with
his
personal
baggage
and
assisted
us
in
every
possible
way
we
went
to
the
foreign
office
at
half
past
ten
and
were
ushered
into
a
large
room
where
a
rather
imposing
lunch
had
already
been
spread
the
commissioner
a
fat
jolly
little
man
who
knew
a
few
words
of
french
but
none
of
english
received
us
in
the
most
cordial
way
and
immediately
opened
several
bottles
of
champagne
in
our
honor
he
asked
why
our
passports
had
not
been
viséd
in
peking
and
we
pleased
him
greatly
by
replying
that
at
the
time
we
were
in
the
capital
was
an
independent
province
and
consequently
the
peking
government
had
not
the
temerity
to
put
their
stamp
upon
our
passports
inasmuch
as
was
infested
with
brigands
we
had
expected
some
opposition
to
our
plans
for
traveling
in
the
interior
but
none
was
forthcoming
and
with
the
exception
of
an
offer
of
a
guard
of
soldiers
for
our
trip
to
fu
which
we
knew
it
would
be
impolitic
to
refuse
we
left
the
foreign
office
with
all
the
desired
permits
the
chinese
government
appeared
to
be
greatly
interested
in
our
zoölogical
study
of
offered
to
assist
us
in
every
way
we
could
suggest
and
telegraphed
to
every
mandarin
in
the
north
and
west
of
the
province
instructing
them
to
receive
us
with
all
honor
and
to
facilitate
our
work
in
every
way
none
of
the
opposition
which
we
had
been
led
to
expect
developed
and
it
is
difficult
to
see
how
we
could
have
been
more
cordially
received
chapter
x
on
the
road
to
fu
on
august
we
dispatched
half
our
equipment
to
fu
and
three
days
later
we
ourselves
left
fu
at
eleven
in
the
morning
after
an
interminable
wait
for
our
caravan
through
the
kindness
of
mr
page
a
house
boat
was
put
at
our
disposal
and
we
sailed
across
the
upper
end
of
the
beautiful
lake
which
lies
just
outside
the
city
and
intercepted
the
caravan
from
fu
on
the
way
we
passed
a
number
of
cormorant
fishers
each
with
ten
or
a
dozen
birds
sitting
quietly
upon
the
boat
with
outspread
wings
drying
their
feathers
every
bird
has
a
ring
about
its
neck
and
is
thus
prevented
from
swallowing
the
fish
which
it
catches
by
diving
into
the
water
after
waiting
an
hour
for
our
caravan
we
saw
the
long
train
of
mules
and
horses
winding
up
the
hill
toward
us
there
were
seventeen
altogether
and
in
the
midst
of
them
rode
the
cook
clinging
desperately
with
both
hands
to
a
diminutive
mule
his
long
legs
dangling
and
a
look
of
utter
wretchedness
upon
his
face
just
before
the
caravan
reached
us
it
began
to
rain
and
the
cook
laboriously
pulled
on
a
suit
of
yellow
oilskins
which
we
had
purchased
for
him
in
fu
these
together
with
a
huge
yellow
hat
completed
a
picture
which
made
us
roar
with
laughter

our

on
the
way
to

we
surveyed
the
tiny
horses
with
dismay
as
heller
vainly
tried
to
get
his
girth
tight
enough
to
keep
the
saddle
from
sliding
over
the
animal
tail
he
exclaimed
is
this
a
horse
or
a
squirrel
i
trying
to
ride
but
it
was
not
so
bad
when
we
finally
climbed
aboard
and
found
that
we
did
not
crush
the
little
brutes
a
box
on
each
side
of
the
saddle
with
a
few
odds
and
ends
on
top
made
a
pack
of
at
least
one
hundred
and
sixty
pounds
this
is
heavy
even
for
a
large
animal
and
for
these
tiny
mules
seemed
an
impossibility
but
it
is
the
usual
weight
and
the
way
in
which
they
moved
off
showed
that
they
were
not
overloaded
the
pack
saddle
is
a
remarkably
ingenious
arrangement
the
load
is
strapped
with
a
rawhide
to
a
double
frame
which
fits
loosely
over
a
second
saddle
on
the
animal
back
and
is
held
in
place
by
its
own
weight
if
a
mule
falls
the
pack
comes
off
and
moreover
it
can
be
easily
removed
if
the
road
is
bad
or
whenever
a
stop
is
made
it
has
the
great
disadvantage
however
of
giving
the
horses
serious
back
sores
which
receive
but
scanty
attention
from
the
muleteers
when
we
were
fairly
started
upon
our
long
ride
to
fu
the
time
slipped
by
in
a
succession
of
delightful
days
since
this
was
the
main
caravan
route
the
had
regular
stages
beyond
which
they
would
not
go
if
we
did
not
stop
for
luncheon
the
march
could
be
ended
early
in
the
afternoon
and
we
could
settle
ourselves
for
the
night
in
a
temple
which
always
proved
a
veritable
haven
of
rest
after
a
long
day
in
the
saddle
a
few
pages
from
my
wife
journal
of
september
fifteenth
describes
our
camp
at
and
our
life
on
the
road
to
fu
we
are
sitting
on
the
porch
of
an
old
old
temple
it
is
on
a
hilltop
in
a
forest
grove
with
the
town
lying
at
our
feet
the
sun
is
flooding
the
courtyard
and
throwing
bars
of
golden
light
through
the
twisted
branches
of
a
bent
old
pine
over
the
stone
well
and
into
the
dim
recesses
behind
the
altar
where
a
benevolent
idol
grins
down
upon
us
we
have
been
in
the
saddle
for
eight
hours
and
it
is
enchanting
to
rest
in
this
peaceful
aged
temple
outside
children
are
shouting
and
laughing
but
all
is
quiet
here
save
for
the
drip
of
water
in
the
well
and
the
chatter
of
a
magpie
on
the
pine
tree
today
we
made
the
stage
in
one
long
march
and
now
we
can
rest
and
browse
among
our
books
or
wander
with
a
gun
along
the
cool
paths
the
sun
is
hot
at
although
the
mornings
and
evenings
are
cold
and
tonight
we
shall
build
a
fragrant
fire
of
yellow
pine
and
talk
for
an
hour
before
we
go
to
sleep
upon
the
porch
where
we
can
see
the
moon
come
up
and
the
stars
shining
so
low
that
they
seem
like
tiny
lanterns
in
the
sky
it
is
seven
days
since
we
left
fu
and
each
night
we
have
come
to
temples
such
as
this
there
is
an
inexpressible
charm
about
them
lying
asleep
as
it
were
among
the
trees
of
their
courtyards
with
stately
pillared
porches
and
picturesque
gables
upturned
to
the
sky
they
seem
so
very
very
old
and
filled
with
such
great
calm
and
peace
sometimes
they
stand
in
the
midst
of
a
populous
town
and
we
ride
through
long
streets
between
dirty
houses
swarming
with
ragged
women
filthy
men
and
screaming
children
suddenly
we
come
to
the
dilapidated
entrance
of
our
temple
pass
through
a
courtyard
close
the
huge
gates
and
are
in
another
world
we
leave
early
every
morning
and
the
boys
are
up
long
before
dawn
as
we
sleepily
open
our
eyes
we
see
their
dark
figures
silhouetted
against
the
brilliant
camp
fire
hear
the
yawns
of
the
and
the
contented
crunching
of
the
mules
as
they
chew
their
beans
wu
appears
with
a
lantern
and
calls
out
the
hour
and
before
we
have
fully
dressed
the
odor
of
coffee
has
found
its
way
to
the
remotest
corner
of
the
temple
and
a
breakfast
of
pancakes
eggs
and
oatmeal
is
awaiting
on
the
folding
table
spread
with
a
clean
white
cloth
while
we
are
eating
the
beds
are
packed
and
the
loads
retied
accompanied
by
a
running
fire
of
exhortations
to
the
who
cause
us
endless
trouble
they
are
a
hard
lot
these
force
seems
to
be
the
only
thing
they
understand
and
kindness
produces
no
results
if
the
march
is
long
and
we
stop
for
tiffin
it
is
impossible
to
get
them
started
within
three
hours
without
the
aid
of
threats
once
after
a
long
halt
when
all
seemed
ready
we
rode
ahead
only
to
wait
by
the
roadside
for
hours
before
the
caravan
arrived
as
soon
as
we
were
out
of
sight
they
had
begun
to
shoe
their
mules
and
that
night
we
did
not
make
our
stage
until
long
after
dark
in
the
morning
when
we
see
the
first
loads
actually
on
the
horses
we
ride
off
at
the
head
of
the
caravan
followed
by
a
straggling
line
of
mules
and
horses
picking
their
way
over
the
jagged
stones
of
the
road
it
is
delightful
in
the
early
morning
for
the
air
is
fresh
and
brisk
like
that
of
october
at
home
but
later
in
the
day
when
the
sun
is
higher
it
is
uncomfortably
hot
and
we
are
glad
to
find
a
bit
of
shade
where
we
can
rest
until
the
caravan
arrives
the
roads
are
execrable
the
chinese
have
a
proverb
which
says
a
road
is
good
for
ten
years
and
bad
for
ten
thousand
and
this
applies
most
excellently
to
those
of
the
main
caravan
highways
are
paved
with
huge
stones
to
make
them
passable
during
the
rainy
season
but
after
a
few
years
wear
the
blocks
become
broken
and
irregular
the
earth
is
washed
from
between
them
and
they
are
upturned
at
impossible
angles
the
result
is
a
chaotic
mass
which
by
no
stretch
of
imagination
can
be
called
a
road
where
the
stones
are
still
in
place
they
have
been
worn
to
such
glasslike
smoothness
by
the
thousands
of
passing
mules
that
it
is
impossible
to
walk
upon
them
as
a
result
a
caravan
avoids
the
paving
whenever
it
can
find
a
path
and
sometimes
dozens
of
trails
wind
over
the
hills
beside
the
road
we
are
seldom
on
level
ground
for
ten
per
cent
of
the
entire
province
is
mountainous
and
we
soon
lost
count
of
the
ranges
which
we
crossed
it
is
slow
hard
work
toiling
up
the
steep
but
once
on
the
ridges
where
the
country
is
spread
out
below
us
like
a
great
green
relief
map
there
is
a
wonderful
exhilaration
and
we
climb
higher
with
a
joyous
sense
of
freedom
means
south
of
the
cloud
and
every
morning
the
peaks
about
us
are
shrouded
in
fog
sometimes
the
mists
still
float
about
the
mountain
tops
when
we
climb
into
them
and
we
are
suddenly
enveloped
in
a
wet
gray
blanket
which
sends
us
shivering
into
the
coats
tied
to
our
saddles
for
centuries
this
road
has
been
one
of
the
main
trade
arteries
through
the
province
and
with
the
total
lack
of
conservation
ideas
so
characteristic
of
the
chinese
every
available
bit
of
natural
forest
has
been
cut
away
as
a
result
the
mountains
are
desert
wastes
of
sandstone
alternating
with
hills
sometimes
clothed
with
groves
of
pines
or
spruces
these
trees
have
all
been
planted
and
ere
they
have
reached
a
height
of
fifteen
or
twenty
feet
will
yield
to
the
insistent
demand
for
wood
which
is
ever
present
with
the
chinese
the
ignorance
of
the
need
of
forest
conservation
is
an
illuminating
commentary
on
chinese
education
william
hanna
a
missionary
of
fu
told
us
that
one
day
he
was
riding
over
this
same
road
with
a
chinese
gentleman
a
deep
scholar
who
was
considered
one
of
the
best
educated
men
of
the
province
pointing
to
the
barren
hills
washed
clean
of
soil
and
deeply
worn
by
countless
floods
hanna
remarked
that
all
this
could
have
been
prevented
and
that
instead
of
a
rocky
waste
there
might
have
been
a
fertile
hillside
had
the
trees
been
left
to
grow
the
chinese
scholar
listened
in
amazement
to
facts
which
every
western
schoolboy
has
learned
ere
he
is
twelve
years
old
but
of
which
he
was
ignorant
because
they
are
not
a
part
of
confucius
teachings
to
study
modern
science
is
considered
a
waste
of
time
by
the
orthodox
chinese
for
everything
good
must
be
old
and
all
his
life
he
delves
into
the
past
utterly
neglectful
of
the
present
every
valley
along
the
road
was
green
with
rice
fields
and
this
together
with
the
deforestation
of
the
mountains
is
responsible
for
the
almost
total
lack
of
animal
life
night
after
night
we
set
traps
about
our
temple
camps
only
to
find
them
untouched
in
the
morning
there
were
no
mammals
with
the
exception
of
a
few
squirrels
subsp
and
now
and
then
a
tree
shrew
belangeri
the
latter
is
an
interesting
species
although
it
is
an
insectivore
and
a
relative
of
the
tiny
shrews
which
live
in
holes
and
under
logs
it
has
habits
and
in
appearance
is
like
a
squirrel
to
which
it
is
totally
unrelated
instead
of
the
thinly
haired
mouselike
tails
of
the
ordinary
shrews
the
tupaias
have
developed
long
bushy
tails
and
in
fact
look
and
act
so
much
like
squirrels
that
it
is
difficult
to
convince
the
white
residents
of
who
are
accustomed
to
see
them
run
about
the
hedges
and
walls
of
their
courtyards
that
the
two
are
quite
unrelated
the
tree
shrews
are
found
only
in
asia
and
are
one
of
the
most
remarkable
instances
of
a
superficial
resemblance
between
unrelated
animals
with
similar
habits
a
study
of
their
anatomy
has
revealed
the
fact
that
they
represent
a
distinct
group
which
is
connected
with
the
monkeys
lemurs
although
birds
were
fairly
abundant
the
species
were
not
varied
we
were
about
a
month
too
early
for
the
ducks
and
geese
which
during
the
winter
swarm
into
from
the
north
and
without
a
dog
pheasants
are
difficult
to
get
in
fact
we
were
greatly
disappointed
in
the
game
birds
for
we
had
expected
good
pheasant
shooting
even
along
the
road
and
virtually
none
were
to
be
found
the
main
caravan
roads
of
held
little
of
interest
for
us
as
naturalists
but
as
students
of
native
customs
they
were
fascinating
for
the
life
of
the
province
passed
before
us
in
panoramic
completeness
chinese
villages
wherever
we
have
seen
them
are
marvels
of
utter
and
abandoned
filth
and
although
those
of
are
no
exception
to
the
rule
they
are
considerably
better
than
the
coast
cities
pigs
chickens
horses
and
cows
live
in
happy
communion
with
the
human
inmates
of
the
houses
the
pigs
especially
being
treated
as
we
favor
dogs
at
home
on
the
door
steps
children
play
with
the
swine
patting
and
pounding
them
and
one
of
my
friends
said
that
he
had
actually
seen
a
mother
bring
her
baby
to
be
nursed
by
a
sow
with
her
family
of
piglets
the
natives
were
pleasant
and
friendly
and
seemed
to
be
industrious
wherever
the
deforestation
had
left
sufficient
soil
on
the
lower
hillsides
patches
of
corn
took
the
place
of
the
former
poppy
fields
for
opium
in
the
empress
dowager
issued
an
edict
prohibiting
the
growing
of
opium
and
gave
guarantees
to
the
british
that
it
would
be
entirely
stamped
out
during
the
next
ten
years
strangely
enough
these
promises
have
been
faithfully
kept
and
in
the
hillsides
which
were
once
white
with
poppy
blossoms
are
now
yellow
with
corn
in
all
our
miles
of
riding
over
unfrequented
trails
and
in
the
most
spots
we
found
only
one
instance
where
opium
was
being
cultivated
the
mandarin
of
each
district
accompanied
by
a
guard
of
soldiers
makes
periodical
excursions
during
the
seasons
when
the
poppy
is
in
blossom
cuts
down
the
plants
if
any
are
found
and
punishes
the
owners
china
deserves
the
greatest
credit
for
so
successfully
dealing
with
a
question
which
affects
such
a
large
part
of
her
four
hundred
millions
of
people
and
which
presents
such
unusual
difficulties
because
of
its
economic
importance
just
across
the
frontier
in
burma
opium
is
grown
freely
and
much
is
smuggled
into
therefore
its
use
has
by
no
means
been
abandoned
especially
in
the
south
of
the
province
and
in
some
towns
it
is
smoked
openly
in
the
tea
houses
in
august
just
before
we
reached
fu
there
was
an
of
opium
smuggling
which
throws
an
illuminating
side
light
on
the
corruption
of
some
chinese
officials
opium
can
be
purchased
in
fu
for
two
dollars
mexican
an
ounce
while
in
shanghai
it
is
worth
ten
dollars
mexican
tang
the
military
governor
the
minister
of
justice
the
governor
brother
and
three
members
of
parliament
had
collected
six
hundred
pounds
of
opium
which
they
undertook
to
transfer
to
shanghai
their
request
that
no
examination
of
their
baggage
be
made
by
the
french
during
their
passage
through
tonking
was
granted
and
a
similar
favor
was
procured
for
them
at
shanghai
thus
the
sixty
cases
were
safely
landed
but
a
few
hours
later
through
the
opium
combine
foreign
detectives
learned
of
the
smuggling
and
the
boxes
were
seized
the
minister
of
justice
denied
all
knowledge
of
the
opium
as
did
the
three
parliament
members
and
governor
tang
was
not
interrogated
as
that
would
be
quite
contrary
to
the
laws
of
chinese
etiquette
however
he
will
not
receive
reappointment
when
his
official
term
expires
as
we
neared
fu
and
indeed
along
the
entire
road
we
were
amazed
at
the
prevalence
of
goitre
at
a
conservative
estimate
two
out
of
every
five
persons
were
suffering
from
the
disease
some
having
two
or
even
three
globules
of
uneven
size
hanging
from
their
throats
in
one
village
six
out
of
seven
adults
were
affected
but
apparently
children
under
twelve
or
fourteen
years
are
free
from
it
as
we
saw
no
evidences
in
either
sex
probably
the
disease
is
in
a
large
measure
due
to
the
drinking
water
for
it
is
most
prevalent
in
the
limestone
regions
and
seems
to
be
somewhat
localized
every
day
we
passed
chairs
or
as
we
named
them
mountain
schooners
in
each
of
which
a
fat
chinaman
sprawled
while
two
or
four
sweating
coolies
bore
him
up
hill
the
chair
is
rigged
between
a
pair
of
long
bamboo
poles
and
consists
of
two
sticks
swung
by
ropes
on
which
is
piled
a
heap
of
bedding
overhead
a
light
bamboo
frame
supports
a
piece
of
yellow
which
completely
shuts
in
the
occupant
except
from
the
front
and
rear
the
chinese
consider
it
undignified
to
walk
or
even
to
ride
and
if
one
is
about
to
make
an
official
visit
nothing
less
than
a
chair
is
required
haste
is
just
as
much
tabooed
in
the
front
families
as
physical
exertion
and
is
utterly
incomprehensible
to
the
chinese
major
davies
says
that
while
he
was
in
tonking
before
the
railroad
to
fu
had
been
constructed
doumer
the
of
french
who
was
a
very
energetic
man
rode
to
fu
in
an
extraordinarily
short
time
while
the
europeans
greatly
admired
his
feat
the
chinese
believed
he
must
be
in
some
difficulty
from
which
only
the
immediate
assistance
of
the
viceroy
of
could
extricate
him
in
it
is
necessary
to
carry
one
own
bedding
for
the
inns
supply
nothing
but
food
and
consequently
when
a
chinaman
rides
from
one
city
to
another
he
piles
a
great
heap
of
blankets
on
his
back
and
climbs
on
top
with
his
legs
astride
the
animal
neck
in
front
the
horses
are
trained
to
a
rapid
trot
instead
of
a
gallop
and
i
know
of
no
more
ridiculous
sight
than
a
chinaman
bouncing
along
a
road
on
the
summit
of
a
veritable
mountain
of
bedding
with
his
arms
waving
and
streamers
flying
in
every
direction
he
is
assisted
in
keeping
his
balance
by
broad
brass
stirrups
in
which
he
usually
hooks
his
heels
and
guides
his
horse
by
means
of
a
rawhide
bridle
decorated
with
dozens
of
bangles
which
make
a
comforting
jingle
whenever
he
moves
on
the
sixth
day
out
when
approaching
the
city
of
fu
we
took
a
short
cut
through
the
fields
leaving
the
caravan
to
follow
the
main
road
the
trail
brought
us
to
a
river
about
forty
feet
wide
spanned
by
a
bridge
made
from
two
narrow
planks
with
a
wide
median
fissure
we
led
our
horses
across
without
trouble
and
heller
started
to
follow
he
had
reached
the
center
of
the
bridge
when
his
horse
shied
at
the
hole
jumped
to
one
side
hung
suspended
on
his
belly
for
a
moment
and
toppled
off
into
the
water
the
performance
had
all
happened
behind
heller
back
and
when
he
turned
about
in
time
to
see
his
horse
diving
into
the
river
he
stood
looking
down
at
him
with
a
most
ludicrous
expression
of
surprise
and
disgust
while
the
animal
climbed
out
and
began
to
graze
as
quietly
as
though
nothing
had
happened
was
interesting
as
being
the
home
of
miss
cordelia
morgan
a
niece
of
senator
morgan
of
virginia
we
found
her
to
be
a
most
charming
and
determined
young
woman
who
had
established
a
mission
station
in
the
city
under
considerable
difficulties
the
mandarin
and
other
officials
by
no
means
wished
to
have
a
foreign
lady
alone
and
unattended
settle
down
among
them
and
become
a
responsibility
which
might
cause
them
endless
trouble
and
although
she
had
rented
a
house
before
she
arrived
the
owner
refused
to
allow
her
to
move
in
she
could
get
no
assistance
from
the
mandarin
and
was
forced
to
live
for
two
months
in
a
dirty
chinese
inn
swarming
with
vermin
until
they
realized
that
she
was
determined
not
to
be
driven
away
she
eventually
obtained
a
house
and
while
she
considers
herself
comfortable
i
doubt
if
others
would
care
to
share
her
life
unless
they
had
an
equal
amount
of
determination
and
enthusiasm
at
that
time
she
had
not
placed
her
work
under
the
charge
of
a
mission
board
and
was
carrying
it
on
independently
until
our
arrival
she
had
seen
but
one
white
person
in
a
year
and
a
half
was
living
entirely
upon
chinese
food
and
had
tasted
no
butter
or
milk
in
months
we
had
a
delightful
dinner
with
miss
morgan
and
the
next
morning
as
our
caravan
wound
down
the
long
hill
past
her
house
she
stood
at
the
window
to
wave
she
kept
her
head
behind
the
curtains
and
doubtless
if
we
could
have
seen
her
face
we
would
have
found
tears
upon
it
for
the
evening
with
another
woman
of
her
kind
had
brought
to
her
a
breath
of
the
old
life
which
she
had
resolutely
forsaken
and
which
so
seldom
penetrated
to
her
exile
on
our
ninth
day
from
fu
we
had
a
welcome
bit
of
excitement
we
were
climbing
a
long
mountain
trail
to
a
pass
over
eight
thousand
feet
high
and
were
near
the
summit
when
a
boy
dashed
breathlessly
up
to
the
caravan
jabbering
wildly
in
chinese
it
required
fifteen
minutes
of
questioning
before
we
finally
learned
that
bandits
had
attacked
a
big
caravan
less
than
a
mile
ahead
of
us
and
were
even
then
ransacking
the
loads
he
said
that
there
were
two
hundred
and
fifty
of
them
and
that
they
had
killed
two
almost
immediately
a
second
gesticulating
chinaman
appeared
and
gave
the
number
as
three
hundred
and
fifty
and
the
dead
as
five
allowing
for
the
universal
habit
of
exaggeration
we
felt
quite
sure
that
there
were
not
more
than
fifty
and
subsequently
learned
that
forty
was
the
correct
number
and
that
no
one
had
been
killed
our
caravan
was
in
a
bad
place
to
resist
an
attack
but
we
got
out
our
rifles
and
made
for
a
village
at
the
top
of
the
pass
there
were
not
more
than
a
half
dozen
mud
houses
and
in
the
narrow
street
between
them
perfect
bedlam
reigned
several
small
caravans
had
halted
to
wait
for
us
and
men
horses
loads
and
chairs
were
packed
and
jammed
together
so
tightly
that
it
seemed
impossible
ever
to
extricate
them
our
arrival
added
to
the
confusion
but
leaving
the
to
scream
and
chatter
among
themselves
we
scouted
ahead
to
learn
the
true
condition
of
affairs
almost
within
sight
we
found
the
caravan
which
had
been
robbed
paper
and
cloth
were
strewn
about
loads
overturned
and
loose
mules
wandered
over
the
hillside
the
frightened
were
straggling
back
and
told
us
that
about
forty
bandits
had
suddenly
surrounded
the
caravan
shooting
and
brandishing
long
knives
instantly
the
had
run
for
their
lives
leaving
the
brigands
to
rifle
the
packs
unmolested
the
goods
chiefly
belonged
to
the
retiring
mandarin
of
and
included
some
five
thousand
dollars
worth
of
jade
and
gold
dust
all
of
which
was
taken
like
most
of
the
outlying
provinces
of
china
is
infested
with
brigands
who
make
traveling
very
unsafe
there
are
of
course
organized
bands
of
robbers
at
all
times
but
these
have
been
greatly
augmented
since
the
rebellion
by
dismissed
soldiers
or
deserters
who
have
taken
to
brigandage
as
the
easiest
means
to
avoid
starvation
the
chinese
government
is
totally
unable
to
cope
with
the
situation
and
makes
only
attempts
to
punish
even
the
most
flagrant
robberies
so
that
unguarded
caravans
carrying
valuable
material
which
arrive
at
their
destination
unmolested
consider
themselves
very
lucky
illustration

pagoda

fu

the
dead
of
china
so
far
as
our
expedition
was
concerned
we
did
not
feel
great
apprehension
for
it
was
generally
known
that
we
carried
but
little
money
and
our
equipment
except
for
guns
could
not
readily
be
disposed
of
throughout
the
entire
expedition
we
paid
our
and
servants
a
part
of
their
wages
in
advance
when
they
were
engaged
and
arranged
to
have
money
sent
by
the
mandarins
or
the
british
american
tobacco
to
some
large
town
which
would
be
reached
after
several
months
there
the
balance
on
salaries
was
paid
and
we
carried
with
us
only
enough
money
for
our
daily
needs
before
we
left
fu
we
were
assured
by
the
foreign
office
that
we
would
be
furnished
with
a
guard
of
soldiers
an
honor
few
foreigners
escape
the
first
day
out
we
had
four
all
armed
with
umbrellas
these
accompanied
us
to
the
first
camp
where
they
delivered
their
official
message
to
the
and
intrusted
us
to
the
care
of
others
for
our
next
day
journey
sometimes
they
were
equipped
with
guns
of
the
vintage
of
but
their
cartridges
were
seldom
of
the
same
caliber
as
the
rifles
and
in
most
cases
the
ubiquitous
umbrella
was
their
only
weapon
just
what
good
they
would
be
in
a
real
attack
it
is
difficult
to
imagine
except
to
divert
attention
by
breaking
the
speed
limits
in
running
away
several
times
in
the
morning
we
believed
we
had
escaped
them
but
they
always
turned
up
in
an
hour
or
two
they
were
not
so
much
a
nuisance
as
an
expense
for
custom
requires
that
each
be
paid
twenty
cents
mexican
a
day
both
going
and
returning
they
are
of
some
use
in
lending
an
official
aspect
to
an
expedition
and
in
requisitioning
anything
which
may
be
needed
also
they
act
as
an
insurance
policy
for
if
a
caravan
is
robbed
a
claim
can
be
entered
against
the
government
whereas
if
the
escort
is
refused
the
traveler
has
no
redress
it
is
amusing
and
often
irritating
to
see
the
cavalier
way
in
which
these
men
treat
other
caravans
or
the
peasants
along
the
road
waving
their
arms
and
shouting
oaths
they
shoe
horses
mules
or
chairs
out
of
the
way
regardless
of
the
confusion
into
which
the
approaching
caravan
may
be
thrown
they
must
also
be
closely
watched
for
they
are
none
too
honest
and
are
prone
to
rely
upon
the
moral
support
of
foreigners
to
take
whatever
they
wish
without
the
formality
of
payment
we
were
especially
careful
to
respect
the
property
on
which
we
camped
and
to
be
just
in
all
our
dealings
with
the
natives
but
it
was
sometimes
difficult
to
prevent
the
or
soldiers
from
tearing
down
fences
for
firewood
or
committing
similar
depredations
wherever
such
acts
were
discovered
we
made
suitable
payment
and
punished
the
offenders
by
deducting
a
part
of
their
wages
foreigners
can
not
respect
too
carefully
the
rights
of
the
peasants
for
upon
their
conduct
rests
the
reception
which
will
be
accorded
to
all
others
who
follow
in
their
footsteps
chapter
xi
fu
on
friday
september
we
were
at
chou
chou
and
camped
in
a
picturesque
little
temple
on
the
outskirts
of
the
town
as
the
last
stage
was
only
six
hours
we
spent
half
the
morning
in
taking
moving
pictures
of
the
caravan
and
left
for
at
after
an
early
about
two
in
the
afternoon
we
reached
a
large
commercial
town
at
the
lower
end
of
the
lake
its
population
largely
consists
of
merchants
and
it
is
by
all
means
the
most
important
business
place
of
interior
eight
miles
away
is
the
residence
and
official
city
at
we
called
upon
the
salt
commissioner
lui
to
whom
mr
bode
the
salt
inspector
at
fu
had
very
kindly
telegraphed
money
for
my
account
and
after
the
usual
tea
and
cigarettes
we
went
oil
to
fu
over
a
perfectly
level
paved
road
which
was
so
slippery
that
it
was
impossible
for
either
horse
or
man
to
move
over
it
faster
than
a
walk
this
was
the
hottest
day
of
our
experience
in
northern
the
thermometer
registering
in
the
shade
which
is
the
usual
temperature
but
the
moment
the
sun
dropped
behind
the
mountains
it
was
cool
enough
for
one
to
enjoy
a
fire
even
in
the
winter
it
is
never
very
cold
and
its
delightful
summer
should
make
northern
a
wonderful
health
resort
for
the
residents
of
burma
and
tonking
we
rode
toward
with
the
beautiful
lake
on
our
right
hand
and
on
the
other
the
shan
mountains
which
rise
to
a
height
of
fourteen
thousand
feet
as
we
approached
the
city
we
could
see
dimly
outlined
against
the
foothills
the
slender
shafts
of
three
ancient
pagodas
they
were
erected
to
the
the
spirits
of
the
earth
wind
and
water
and
for
fifteen
hundred
years
have
stood
guard
over
the
stone
graves
which
in
countless
thousands
are
spread
along
the
foot
of
the
mountains
like
a
vast
gray
blanket
in
the
late
afternoon
sunlight
the
walls
of
the
city
seemed
to
recede
before
us
and
the
picturesque
gate
loomed
shadowy
and
unreal
even
when
we
passed
through
its
gloomy
arch
and
clattered
up
the
street
we
soon
discovered
the
residence
of
evans
agent
of
the
british
american
tobacco
company
to
whose
care
our
first
caravan
had
been
consigned
and
he
very
hospitably
invited
us
to
remain
with
him
while
we
were
in
fu
this
was
only
the
beginning
of
assistance
to
the
expedition
for
he
acted
as
its
banker
throughout
our
stay
in
cashing
checks
and
transferring
money
for
us
whenever
we
needed
funds
the
british
american
tobacco
company
and
the
standard
oil
company
of
new
york
are
veritable
oases
in
the
desert
for
travelers
because
their
agencies
are
found
in
the
most
spots
in
asia
and
their
employees
are
always
ready
to
extend
the
cordial
hospitality
of
the
east
to
wandering
foreigners
besides
evans
the
white
residents
of
fu
include
the
reverend
william
hanna
his
wife
and
two
other
ladies
all
of
the
china
inland
mission
hanna
is
doing
a
really
splendid
work
especially
along
educational
and
medical
lines
he
has
built
a
beautiful
little
chapel
a
large
school
and
a
dispensary
in
connection
with
his
house
where
he
and
his
wife
are
occupied
every
morning
treating
the
minor
ills
of
the
natives
christian
and
heathen
alike
fu
was
the
scene
of
tremendous
slaughter
at
the
time
of
the
mohammedan
war
when
the
chinese
captured
the
city
through
the
treachery
of
its
commander
and
turned
the
streets
to
rivers
of
blood
the
mohammedans
were
almost
exterminated
and
the
ruined
stone
walls
testify
to
the
completeness
of
the
chinese
devastation
the
mandarin
at
fu
was
but
dissipated
and
corrupt
he
called
upon
us
the
evening
of
our
arrival
and
almost
immediately
asked
if
we
had
any
shotgun
cartridges
he
remarked
that
he
had
a
gun
but
no
shells
and
as
we
did
not
offer
to
give
him
any
he
continued
to
hint
broadly
at
every
opportunity
the
mandarins
of
lower
rank
often
buy
their
posts
and
depend
upon
what
they
can
make
in
squeeze
from
the
natives
of
their
district
for
reimbursement
and
a
profit
on
their
investment
in
almost
every
case
which
is
brought
to
them
for
adjustment
the
decision
is
withheld
until
the
magistrate
has
learned
which
of
the
parties
is
prepared
to
offer
the
highest
price
for
a
settlement
in
his
favor
the
chinese
peasant
accepting
this
as
the
established
custom
pays
the
bribe
without
a
murmur
if
it
is
not
too
exorbitant
and
in
fact
would
be
exceedingly
surprised
if
justice
were
dispensed
in
any
other
way
my
personal
relations
with
the
various
mandarins
whom
i
was
constantly
required
to
visit
officially
were
always
of
the
pleasantest
and
i
was
treated
with
great
courtesy
it
was
apparent
wherever
we
were
in
china
that
there
was
a
total
lack
of
antiforeign
feeling
in
both
the
peasant
and
official
classes
and
except
for
the
brigands
who
are
beyond
the
law
undoubtedly
white
men
can
travel
in
perfect
safety
anywhere
in
the
republic
before
my
first
official
visit
wu
gave
me
a
lesson
in
etiquette
the
chinese
are
exceedingly
punctilious
and
it
is
necessary
to
conform
to
their
standards
of
politeness
for
they
do
not
realize
or
accept
in
excuse
the
fact
that
western
customs
differ
from
their
own
at
the
end
of
the
reception
room
in
every
is
a
raised
platform
on
which
the
visitor
sits
at
the
of
the
mandarin
it
would
be
exceedingly
rude
for
a
magistrate
to
seat
the
caller
on
his
right
hand
tea
is
always
served
immediately
but
is
not
supposed
to
be
tasted
until
the
official
does
so
himself
the
cup
must
then
be
lifted
to
the
lips
with
both
hands
usually
when
the
magistrate
sips
his
tea
it
is
a
sign
that
the
interview
is
ended
when
leaving
the
mandarin
follows
his
visitor
to
the
doorway
of
the
outer
court
while
the
latter
continually
bows
and
protests
asking
him
not
to
come
so
far
fu
and
are
important
fur
markets
and
we
spent
some
time
investigating
the
shops
one
important
find
was
the
panda
the
panda
is
an
aberrant
member
of
the
raccoon
family
but
looks
rather
like
a
fox
in
fact
the
chinese
call
it
the
fire
fox
because
of
its
beautiful
red
fur
pandas
were
supposed
to
be
exceedingly
rare
and
we
could
hardly
believe
it
possible
when
we
saw
dozens
of
coats
made
from
their
skins
hanging
in
the
fur
shops
illustration
the
residence
of
rev
william
hanna
at
fu
illustration
the
gate
and
main
street
of
fu
skins
of
the
huge
flying
squirrel
were
also
used
for
clothing
and
the
abundance
of
this
animal
was
almost
as
great
a
surprise
as
the
finding
of
the
pandas
this
is
often
true
in
the
case
of
supposedly
rare
species
a
few
specimens
may
be
obtained
from
the
extreme
limits
of
its
range
or
from
a
locality
where
it
really
is
rare
and
for
years
it
may
be
almost
unique
in
museum
collections
but
eventually
the
proper
locality
may
be
visited
and
the
animals
found
to
be
abundant
we
saw
several
skins
of
the
beautiful
cat
which
with
the
snow
leopard
it
was
said
came
from
tibet
civets
bears
foxes
and
small
cats
were
being
used
extensively
for
furs
and
pangolins
could
be
purchased
in
the
medicine
shops
the
scales
of
the
pangolin
are
considered
to
be
of
great
value
in
the
treatment
of
certain
diseases
and
the
skins
are
usually
sold
by
the
pound
as
are
the
horns
of
deer
wapiti
gorals
and
serows
almost
all
of
the
fossil
animals
which
have
been
obtained
in
china
by
foreigners
have
been
purchased
in
apothecary
shops
if
a
chinaman
discovers
a
fossil
bed
he
guards
it
zealously
for
it
represents
an
actual
gold
mine
to
him
the
bones
are
ground
into
a
fine
powder
mixed
with
an
acid
and
a
phosphate
obtained
which
in
reality
has
a
certain
value
as
a
tonic
when
a
considerable
amount
of
faith
and
chinese
superstition
is
added
its
efficacy
assumes
double
proportions
every
year
a
few
tiger
skins
find
their
way
to
from
the
southern
part
of
the
province
along
the
tonking
border
but
the
good
ones
are
quickly
sold
at
prices
varying
from
to
fifty
dollars
mexican
ten
dollars
is
the
usual
price
for
leopard
skins
marco
polo
visited
fu
in
the
thirteenth
century
and
among
other
things
he
speaks
of
the
fine
horses
from
this
part
of
the
province
we
were
surprised
to
find
that
the
animals
are
considerably
larger
and
more
heavily
built
than
those
of
fu
and
appear
to
be
better
in
every
way
a
good
riding
horse
can
be
purchased
for
dollars
mexican
but
mules
are
worth
about
one
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
because
they
are
considered
better
pack
animals
on
the
advice
of
men
who
had
traveled
much
in
the
interior
of
we
hired
our
caravan
and
riding
animals
instead
of
buying
them
outright
and
subsequent
experience
showed
the
wisdom
of
this
course
saddle
ponies
which
are
used
only
for
short
trips
about
the
city
can
not
endure
continual
traveling
over
the
execrable
roads
of
the
interior
where
often
it
is
impossible
to
feed
them
properly
if
an
entire
caravan
were
purchased
the
leader
of
the
expedition
would
have
unceasing
trouble
with
the
to
insure
even
ordinary
care
of
the
animals
an
opportunity
would
be
given
for
endless
squeeze
in
the
purchase
of
food
and
there
are
other
reasons
too
numerous
to
mention
why
in
this
province
the
plan
is
impracticable
however
the
caravan
ponies
do
try
one
patience
to
the
limit
they
are
trained
only
to
follow
a
leader
and
if
one
happens
to
be
behind
another
horse
it
is
impossible
to
persuade
it
to
pass
beat
or
kick
the
beast
as
one
will
it
only
backs
up
or
crowds
closely
to
the
horse
in
front
on
the
first
day
out
heller
who
was
on
a
particularly
bad
animal
when
trying
to
pass
one
of
us
began
to
cavort
about
like
a
circus
rider
prancing
from
side
to
side
and
backward
but
never
going
forward
we
shouted
that
we
would
wait
for
him
to
go
on
but
he
replied
helplessly
i
ca
this
horse
is
under
my
management
and
we
found
very
soon
that
our
animals
were
not
under
our
management
either
in
a
town
near
fu
we
were
in
front
of
the
caravan
with
wu
and
heller
wu
stopped
to
buy
a
basket
of
mushrooms
but
his
horse
refused
to
move
ahead
beat
as
he
would
the
animal
only
backed
in
a
circle
ours
followed
and
in
a
few
moments
we
were
packed
together
so
tightly
that
it
was
impossible
even
to
dismount
there
we
sat
helpless
to
the
huge
delight
of
the
villagers
until
rescued
by
a
as
soon
as
he
led
wu
horse
forward
the
others
proceeded
as
quietly
as
lambs
we
paid
forty
cents
mexican
a
day
for
each
animal
while
traveling
and
fifteen
or
twenty
cents
when
in
camp
but
the
rate
varies
somewhat
in
different
parts
of
the
province
and
in
the
west
and
south
along
the
burma
border
fifty
cents
is
the
usual
price
when
a
caravan
is
engaged
the
necessary
are
included
and
they
buy
food
for
themselves
and
beans
and
hay
for
the
animals
ever
since
leaving
fu
the
cook
we
engaged
at
had
been
a
source
of
combined
irritation
and
amusement
he
was
a
lanky
effeminate
gentleman
who
never
before
had
ridden
a
horse
and
who
was
physically
and
mentally
unable
to
adapt
himself
to
camp
life
after
five
months
in
the
field
he
appeared
to
be
as
helpless
when
the
caravan
camped
for
the
night
as
when
we
first
started
and
he
would
stand
vacantly
staring
until
someone
directed
him
what
to
do
but
he
was
a
good
cook
when
he
wished
to
exert
himself
and
had
the
great
asset
of
knowing
a
considerable
amount
of
english
while
we
were
in
fu
evans
overheard
him
relating
his
experiences
on
the
road
to
several
of
the
other
servants
of
course
said
the
cook
it
is
a
fine
way
to
see
the
country
but
the
riding
my
goodness
that
awful
after
the
third
day
i
did
know
whether
to
go
on
or
turn
back
i
was
so
sore
i
could
sit
down
even
on
a
chair
to
say
nothing
of
a
horse
he
had
evidently
fully
made
up
his
mind
not
to
see
the
country
that
way
for
the
day
after
we
left
fu
to
the
tibetan
frontier
he
became
violently
ill
although
we
could
find
nothing
the
matter
with
him
he
made
such
a
good
case
for
himself
that
we
believed
he
really
was
quite
sick
and
treated
him
accordingly
the
following
morning
however
he
sullenly
refused
to
proceed
and
we
realized
that
his
illness
was
of
the
mind
rather
than
the
body
as
he
had
accepted
two
months
salary
in
advance
and
had
already
sent
it
to
his
wife
in
we
were
in
a
position
to
use
a
certain
amount
of
forceful
persuasion
which
entirely
accomplished
its
object
and
illness
did
not
trouble
him
thereafter
the
loss
of
a
cook
is
a
serious
matter
to
a
large
expedition
good
meals
and
varied
food
must
be
provided
if
the
personnel
is
to
work
at
its
highest
efficiency
and
cooking
requires
a
vast
amount
of
thought
and
time
in
natives
who
can
cook
foreign
food
are
by
no
means
easy
to
find
and
when
our
gentleman
finally
left
us
upon
our
return
to
fu
we
were
fortunate
in
obtaining
an
exceedingly
competent
man
to
take
his
place
through
the
good
offices
of
hanna
chapter
xii
and
the
temple
of
the
flowers
we
left
a
part
of
our
outfit
with
evans
at
fu
and
with
a
new
caravan
of
animals
traveled
northward
for
six
days
to
fu
by
taking
a
small
road
we
hoped
to
find
good
collecting
in
the
pine
forests
three
days
from
but
instead
there
was
a
total
absence
of
animal
life
the
woods
were
beautiful
parklike
stretches
which
in
a
country
like
california
would
be
full
of
game
but
here
were
silent
and
deserted
during
the
fourth
and
fifth
days
we
were
still
in
the
forests
but
on
the
sixth
we
crossed
a
pass
feet
high
and
descended
abruptly
into
a
long
marshy
plain
where
at
the
far
end
were
the
gray
outlines
of
dimly
visible
against
the
mountains
wu
and
i
galloped
ahead
to
find
a
temple
for
our
camp
leaving
heller
and
my
wife
to
follow
a
few
pages
from
her
journal
tell
of
their
entry
into
the
city
we
rode
along
a
winding
stone
causeway
and
halted
on
the
outskirts
of
the
town
to
wait
until
the
caravan
arrived
neither
roy
nor
wu
was
in
sight
but
we
expected
that
the
would
ask
where
they
had
gone
and
follow
for
of
coarse
we
could
not
speak
a
word
of
the
language
already
there
was
quite
a
sensation
as
we
came
down
the
street
for
our
sudden
appearance
seemed
to
have
stupefied
the
people
with
amazement
one
old
lady
looked
at
me
with
an
indescribable
expression
and
uttered
what
sounded
exactly
like
a
mon
dieu
of
disagreeable
surprise
i
tried
smiling
at
them
but
they
appeared
too
astonished
to
appreciate
our
friendliness
and
in
return
merely
stared
with
open
mouths
and
eyes
we
halted
and
immediately
the
street
was
blocked
by
crowds
of
men
women
and
children
who
poured
out
of
the
houses
shops
and
to
gaze
in
rapt
attention
when
the
caravan
arrived
we
moved
on
again
expecting
that
the
had
learned
where
roy
had
gone
but
they
seemed
to
be
wandering
aimlessly
through
the
narrow
winding
streets
even
though
we
did
not
find
a
camping
place
we
afforded
the
natives
intense
delight
i
felt
as
though
i
were
the
chief
actor
in
a
circus
parade
at
home
but
the
most
remarkable
attraction
there
could
not
have
equaled
our
unparalleled
success
in
on
the
second
excursion
through
the
town
we
passed
down
a
and
suddenly
from
a
courtyard
at
the
right
we
heard
feminine
voices
speaking
english
it
a
girl
no
it
a
boy
no
no
ca
you
see
her
hair
a
girl
just
then
we
caught
sight
of
three
ladies
unmistakably
foreigners
although
dressed
in
chinese
costume
they
were
kok
wife
of
the
resident
pentecostal
missionary
and
two
assistants
who
rushed
into
the
street
as
soon
as
they
had
determined
my
sex
and
literally
fell
upon
my
neck
they
had
not
seen
a
white
woman
since
their
arrival
there
four
years
ago
and
it
seemed
to
them
that
i
had
suddenly
dropped
from
the
sky
while
we
were
talking
wu
appeared
to
guide
us
to
the
camp
they
had
chosen
a
beautiful
temple
with
a
courtyard
on
the
summit
of
a
hill
overlooking
the
city
it
was
wonderfully
clean
and
when
our
beds
tables
and
chairs
were
spread
on
the
broad
stone
porch
it
seemed
like
a
real
home
illustration
one
of
the
pagodas
at
fu
the
next
days
were
busy
ones
for
us
all
roy
and
heller
setting
traps
and
i
working
at
my
photography
we
let
it
be
known
that
we
would
pay
well
for
specimens
and
there
was
an
almost
uninterrupted
procession
of
men
and
boys
carrying
long
sticks
on
which
were
strung
frogs
rats
toads
and
snakes
they
would
simply
beam
with
triumph
and
enthusiasm
our
fame
spread
and
more
came
bringing
the
most
ridiculous
tame
things
pigeons
maltese
cats
dogs
white
rabbits
caged
birds
and
i
even
believe
we
might
have
purchased
a
girl
baby
or
two
for
mothers
stood
about
with
little
brown
kiddies
on
their
backs
as
though
they
really
would
like
to
offer
them
to
us
but
hardly
dared
the
temple
priest
was
a
good
looking
chap
and
hidden
under
his
coat
he
brought
dozens
of
skins
i
believe
that
his
religious
vows
did
not
allow
him
to
handle
animals
openly
and
so
he
would
beckon
roy
into
the
darkness
of
the
temple
with
a
most
mysterious
air
and
would
extract
all
sorts
of
things
from
his
sleeves
just
like
a
performer
he
was
a
rich
man
when
we
left
the
people
are
mostly
tribesmen
mosos
lolos
tibetans
and
many
others
the
girls
wear
their
hair
bobbed
off
in
front
and
with
a
long
plait
in
back
they
wash
their
hair
once
on
their
wedding
day
and
then
it
is
wrapped
up
in
turbans
for
the
rest
of
their
lives
the
tibetan
women
dress
their
hair
in
dozens
of
tiny
braids
but
i
do
believe
there
is
any
authority
that
they
ever
wash
it
or
themselves
either
was
our
first
collecting
camp
and
we
never
had
a
better
one
on
the
morning
after
our
arrival
heller
found
mammals
in
half
his
traps
and
in
the
afternoon
we
each
put
out
a
line
of
forty
traps
which
brought
us
fifty
mammals
of
eleven
species
this
was
a
wonderful
relief
after
the
many
days
of
travel
through
country
devoid
of
animal
life
our
traps
contained
shrews
of
two
species
meadow
voles
asiatic
mice
spiny
mice
rats
squirrels
and
tree
shrews
the
small
mammals
were
exceedingly
abundant
and
easy
to
catch
but
after
the
first
day
we
began
to
have
difficulty
with
the
natives
who
stole
our
traps
we
usually
marked
them
with
a
bit
of
cotton
and
the
boys
would
follow
an
entire
line
down
a
hedge
taking
every
one
sometimes
they
even
brought
specimens
to
us
for
sale
which
we
knew
had
been
caught
in
our
stolen
traps
the
traps
were
set
under
logs
and
stumps
and
in
the
grass
where
we
found
the
runways
or
paths
which
mice
rats
and
voles
often
make
these
animals
begin
to
move
about
just
after
dark
and
we
usually
would
inspect
our
traps
with
a
lantern
about
nine
in
the
evening
this
not
only
gave
the
trap
a
double
chance
to
be
filled
but
we
also
secured
perfect
specimens
for
such
species
as
mice
and
shrews
are
cannibalistic
and
almost
every
night
if
the
specimens
were
not
taken
out
early
in
the
evening
several
would
be
partly
eaten
small
mammals
are
often
of
much
greater
interest
and
importance
scientifically
than
large
ones
for
especially
among
the
insectivores
there
are
many
primitive
forms
which
are
apparently
of
ancestral
stock
and
throw
light
on
the
evolutionary
history
of
other
living
groups
is
a
fur
market
of
considerable
importance
for
the
tibetans
bring
down
vast
quantities
of
skins
for
sale
and
trade
lambs
goats
foxes
cats
civets
pandas
and
flying
squirrels
hang
in
the
shops
and
there
are
dozens
of
fur
dressers
who
do
really
excellent
tanning
this
city
is
a
most
interesting
place
especially
on
market
day
for
its
inhabitants
represent
many
different
tribes
with
but
comparatively
few
chinese
by
far
the
greatest
percentage
of
natives
are
the
mosos
who
are
in
their
life
and
customs
they
were
originally
an
independent
race
who
ruled
a
considerable
part
of
northern
and
was
their
ancient
capital
to
the
effeminate
and
highly
civilized
chinese
they
are
barbarians
but
we
found
them
to
be
simple
honest
and
wholly
delightful
people
many
of
those
whom
we
met
later
had
never
seen
a
white
woman
and
yet
their
inherent
decency
was
in
the
greatest
contrast
to
that
of
the
chinese
who
consider
themselves
so
immeasurably
their
superior
the
mosos
have
large
herds
of
sheep
and
cattle
and
this
is
the
one
place
in
the
orient
except
in
large
cities
along
the
coast
where
we
could
obtain
fresh
milk
and
butter
as
with
the
tibetans
buttered
tea
and
parched
oatmeal
are
the
great
essentials
but
they
also
grow
quantities
of
delicious
vegetables
and
fruit
buttered
tea
is
prepared
by
churning
fresh
butter
into
hot
tea
until
the
two
have
become
well
mixed
it
is
then
thickened
with
finely
ground
until
a
ball
is
formed
which
is
eaten
with
the
fingers
the
combination
is
distinctly
good
when
the
ingredients
are
fresh
but
if
the
butter
happens
to
be
rancid
the
less
said
of
it
the
better
the
natives
of
this
region
are
largely
agriculturists
and
raise
great
quantities
of
squash
turnips
carrots
cabbage
potatoes
onions
corn
peas
beans
oranges
pears
persimmons
and
nuts
while
traveling
we
filled
our
saddle
pockets
with
pears
and
english
walnuts
or
chestnuts
and
could
replenish
our
stock
at
almost
any
village
along
the
road
everything
was
absurdly
cheap
eggs
were
usually
about
eight
cents
mexican
a
dozen
and
we
could
always
purchase
a
chicken
for
an
empty
tin
can
or
two
for
a
bottle
in
fact
the
latter
was
the
greatest
desideratum
and
when
offers
of
money
failed
to
induce
a
native
to
pose
for
the
camera
a
bottle
nearly
always
would
decide
matters
in
our
favor
in
we
learned
that
there
was
good
shooting
only
twelve
miles
north
of
the
city
on
the
snow
mountain
range
the
highest
peak
of
which
rises
feet
above
the
sea
we
left
a
part
of
our
outfit
at
kok
house
and
engaged
a
caravan
of
seventeen
mules
to
take
us
to
the
hunting
grounds
kok
assisted
us
in
numberless
ways
while
we
were
in
the
vicinity
of
and
in
other
parts
of
the
country
he
took
charge
of
all
our
mail
sending
it
to
us
by
runners
loaned
us
money
when
it
was
difficult
to
get
cash
from
fu
and
helped
us
to
engage
servants
and
caravans
it
had
rained
almost
continually
for
five
days
and
a
dense
gray
curtain
of
fog
hung
far
down
in
the
valley
but
on
the
morning
of
october
we
awoke
to
find
ourselves
in
another
world
we
were
in
a
vast
amphitheater
of
encircling
mountains
white
almost
to
their
bases
rising
ridge
on
ridge
like
the
foamy
billows
of
a
mighty
ocean
at
the
north
silhouetted
against
the
vivid
blue
of
a
cloudless
sky
towered
the
great
snow
mountain
its
jagged
peaks
crowned
with
gold
where
the
morning
sun
had
kissed
their
summits
we
rode
toward
it
across
a
level
plain
and
watched
the
fleecy
clouds
form
and
float
upward
to
weave
in
and
out
or
lose
themselves
in
the
vast
snow
craters
beside
the
glacier
it
was
an
inspiration
that
beautiful
mountain
lying
so
white
and
still
in
its
cradle
of
dark
green
trees
each
hour
it
seemed
more
wonderful
more
dominating
in
its
grandeur
and
we
were
glad
to
be
of
the
chosen
few
to
look
upon
its
sacred
beauty

a
moso
woman
in
the
early
afternoon
we
camped
in
a
tiny
temple
which
nestled
into
a
grove
of
spruce
trees
on
the
outskirts
of
a
straggling
village
to
the
north
the
snow
mountain
rose
almost
above
us
and
on
the
east
and
south
a
grassy
plain
rolled
away
in
gentle
undulations
to
a
range
of
hills
which
jutted
into
the
valley
like
a
great
recumbent
dragon
a
short
time
after
our
camp
was
established
we
had
a
visit
from
an
austrian
botanist
baron
who
had
been
in
the
village
for
two
weeks
he
had
come
to
for
the
vienna
museum
before
the
war
expecting
to
remain
a
year
but
already
had
been
there
three
surrounded
as
he
was
by
tibet
burma
and
tonking
his
only
possible
exit
was
by
way
of
the
overland
journey
to
shanghai
he
had
little
money
and
for
two
years
had
been
living
on
chinese
food
he
dined
with
us
in
the
evening
and
his
enjoyment
of
our
coffee
bread
kippered
herring
and
other
canned
goods
was
almost
pathetic
a
week
after
our
arrival
baron
left
for
fu
and
eventually
reached
shanghai
which
however
became
a
closed
port
to
him
upon
china
entry
into
the
european
war
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
his
collections
which
must
be
of
great
scientific
value
and
importance
have
arrived
at
a
place
of
safety
long
ere
this
book
issues
from
the
press
chapter
xiii
camping
in
the
clouds
we
hired
four
moso
hunters
in
the
snow
mountain
village
they
were
picturesque
fellows
supposedly
dressed
in
skins
but
their
garments
were
so
ragged
and
patched
that
it
was
difficult
to
determine
the
original
material
of
which
they
were
made
one
of
them
was
armed
with
a
most
extraordinary
gun
which
it
was
said
came
from
tibet
its
barrel
was
more
than
six
feet
long
and
the
stock
was
curved
like
a
golf
stick
a
powder
fuse
projected
from
a
hole
in
the
side
of
the
barrel
and
just
behind
it
on
the
butt
was
fastened
a
forked
spring
at
his
waist
the
man
carried
a
long
coil
of
rope
the
slowly
burning
end
of
which
was
placed
in
the
crotched
spring
when
about
to
shoot
the
native
placed
the
butt
of
the
weapon
against
his
cheek
pressed
the
spring
so
that
the
burning
rope
end
touched
the
powder
fuse
and
off
went
the
gun
the
three
other
hunters
carried
crossbows
and
poisoned
arrows
they
were
remarkably
good
shots
and
at
a
distance
of
one
hundred
feet
could
place
an
arrow
in
a
circle
four
times
out
of
five
we
found
later
that
crossbows
are
in
common
use
throughout
the
more
remote
parts
of
and
were
only
another
evidence
that
we
had
suddenly
dropped
back
into
the
middle
ages
and
with
our
rifles
and
twentieth
century
equipment
were
anachronisms
the
natives
are
able
to
obtain
a
good
deal
of
game
even
with
such
primitive
weapons
for
they
depend
largely
upon
dogs
which
bring
gorals
and
serows
to
bay
against
a
cliff
and
hold
them
until
the
men
arrive
the
dogs
are
a
mongrel
breed
which
appears
to
be
largely
hound
and
some
are
really
excellent
hunters
white
is
the
usual
color
but
a
few
are
mixed
black
and
brown
or
fox
red
hotenfa
one
of
our
mosos
owned
a
good
pack
and
we
all
came
to
love
its
big
red
leader
this
fine
dog
could
be
depended
upon
to
dig
out
game
if
there
was
any
in
the
mountains
but
his
life
with
us
was
short
for
he
was
killed
by
our
first
serow
hotenfa
was
inconsolable
and
the
tears
he
shed
were
in
sincere
sorrow
for
the
loss
of
a
faithful
friend
almost
every
family
owns
a
dog
some
of
those
we
saw
while
passing
through
chinese
villages
were
nauseating
in
their
unsightliness
for
at
least
thirty
per
cent
of
them
were
more
or
less
diseased
barely
able
to
walk
they
would
stagger
across
the
street
or
lie
in
the
gutter
in
indescribable
filth
one
longed
to
put
them
out
of
their
misery
with
a
bullet
but
although
they
seemed
to
belong
to
nobody
if
one
was
killed
an
owner
appeared
like
magic
to
quarrel
over
the
damages
the
dogs
of
the
tribes
were
in
fairly
good
condition
and
there
seemed
to
be
comparatively
little
disease
among
them
our
hunters
treated
their
hounds
kindly
and
fed
them
well
but
the
animals
themselves
although
loyal
to
their
masters
manifested
but
little
affection
in
korea
dogs
are
eaten
by
the
natives
but
none
of
the
tribes
with
which
we
came
in
contact
in
used
them
for
food
on
our
first
day
in
the
temple
heller
went
up
the
snow
mountain
for
a
reconnaissance
and
the
party
secured
a
fine
porcupine
it
is
quite
a
different
animal
from
the
american
tree
porcupines
and
represents
a
genus
which
is
found
in
asia
africa
and
southern
europe
this
species
lives
in
burrows
and
when
hunting
big
game
we
were
often
greatly
annoyed
to
find
that
our
dogs
had
followed
the
trail
of
one
of
these
animals
we
would
arrive
to
see
the
hounds
dancing
about
the
burrow
yelping
excitedly
instead
of
having
a
goral
at
bay
as
we
had
expected
some
of
the
beautiful
black
and
ivory
white
quills
are
more
than
twelve
inches
long
and
very
sharp
a
porcupine
will
keep
an
entire
pack
of
dogs
at
bay
and
is
almost
sure
to
drive
its
murderous
weapons
into
the
bodies
of
some
of
them
unless
the
hunters
arrive
in
a
short
time
the
mosos
eat
the
flesh
which
is
white
and
fine
although
we
were
only
twelve
miles
from
the
traps
yielded
four
shrews
and
one
mouse
which
were
new
to
our
collection
the
natives
brought
in
three
bats
which
we
had
not
previously
seen
and
began
a
thriving
business
in
toads
and
frogs
with
now
and
then
a
snake
the
temple
was
an
excellent
place
for
small
mammals
but
it
was
evident
that
we
would
have
to
move
high
up
on
the
slopes
of
the
mountain
if
gorals
and
other
big
game
were
to
be
obtained
accordingly
while
heller
prepared
a
number
of
bat
skins
we
started
out
on
to
hunt
a
camp
site
it
was
a
glorious
day
with
the
sun
shining
brilliantly
from
a
cloudless
sky
and
just
a
touch
of
autumn
snap
in
the
air
we
crossed
the
sloping
plain
to
the
base
of
the
mountain
and
discovered
a
trail
which
led
up
a
forested
shoulder
to
the
right
of
the
main
peaks
an
hour
of
steady
climbing
brought
us
to
the
summit
of
the
ridge
where
we
struck
into
the
woods
toward
a
on
the
opposite
slope
the
trail
led
us
along
the
brink
of
a
steep
escarpment
from
which
we
could
look
over
the
valley
and
away
into
the
blue
distance
toward
three
thousand
feet
below
us
the
roof
of
our
temple
gleamed
from
among
the
sheltering
pine
trees
and
the
herds
of
sheep
and
cattle
massed
themselves
into
moving
patches
on
the
smooth
brown
plain
illustration
the
snow
mountain
we
pushed
our
way
through
the
spruce
forest
with
the
glistening
snow
bed
as
a
beacon
and
suddenly
emerged
into
a
flat
open
meadow
overshadowed
by
the
ragged
peaks
what
a
perfectly
wonderful
place
to
camp
we
both
exclaimed
if
we
can
only
find
water
let
come
tomorrow
the
hunters
had
assured
us
that
there
were
no
streams
on
this
end
of
the
mountain
but
we
hoped
to
find
a
snow
bank
which
would
supply
our
camp
for
a
few
days
at
least
we
rode
slowly
up
the
meadow
reveling
in
the
grandeur
of
the
pinnacles
and
feeling
very
small
and
helpless
amid
surroundings
where
nature
had
so
magnificently
expressed
herself
at
the
far
end
of
the
meadow
we
discovered
a
dry
creek
bed
which
led
upward
through
the
dense
spruce
forest
where
water
has
been
water
may
be
again
we
argued
and
leading
the
horses
picked
our
way
among
the
trees
and
over
fallen
logs
to
a
fairly
open
hill
slope
where
we
attempted
to
ride
but
our
animals
were
nearly
done
after
climbing
a
few
feet
they
stood
with
heaving
sides
and
trembling
legs
the
breath
rasping
through
distended
nostrils
we
felt
the
altitude
almost
as
badly
as
the
horses
for
the
meadow
itself
was
twelve
thousand
feet
above
the
level
of
the
sea
and
the
air
was
very
thin
there
seemed
to
be
no
hope
of
finding
even
a
suitable
snow
bank
when
it
was
slowly
borne
in
upon
us
that
the
subdued
roaring
in
our
ears
was
the
sound
of
water
and
not
the
effect
of
altitude
as
we
both
imagined
above
and
to
the
left
was
a
sheer
cliff
hundreds
of
feet
in
height
and
as
we
toiled
upward
and
emerged
beyond
timber
line
we
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
silver
ribbon
streaming
down
its
face
it
came
from
a
melting
snow
crater
and
we
could
follow
its
course
with
our
eyes
to
where
it
swung
downward
along
a
rock
wall
not
far
from
the
upper
end
of
the
meadow
it
was
so
hidden
by
the
trees
that
had
we
not
climbed
above
timber
line
it
never
would
have
been
discovered
this
solved
the
question
of
our
camp
and
we
looked
about
us
happily
on
the
way
through
the
forest
we
had
noticed
small
mammal
runways
under
almost
every
log
and
when
we
stood
above
the
tree
limit
the
grassy
slope
was
cut
by
an
intricate
network
of
tiny
tunnels
these
were
plainly
the
work
of
a
meadow
vole
and
at
this
altitude
it
certainly
would
prove
to
be
a
species
new
to
our
collection
the
sun
had
already
dropped
behind
the
mountain
and
the
meadow
was
in
shadow
when
we
reached
it
again
on
our
homeward
way
by
five
we
were
in
the
temple
eating
a
belated
tiffin
and
making
preparations
for
an
early
start
but
our
hopes
were
idle
for
in
the
morning
three
of
the
mules
had
strayed
and
we
did
not
arrive
at
the
meadow
until
two
in
the
afternoon
our
camp
was
made
just
at
the
edge
of
the
spruce
forest
a
few
hundred
yards
from
the
snow
stream
as
soon
as
the
tents
were
up
we
climbed
to
the
grassy
slope
above
timber
line
with
heller
to
set
a
string
of
traps
in
the
vole
runways
and
under
logs
and
stumps

the
hunters
made
their
camp
beside
a
huge
rock
a
short
distance
away
and
slept
in
their
ragged
clothes
without
a
blanket
or
shelter
of
any
kind
it
was
delightfully
warm
even
at
this
altitude
when
the
sun
was
out
but
as
soon
as
it
disappeared
we
needed
a
fire
and
the
nights
were
freezing
cold
yet
the
natives
did
not
seem
to
mind
it
in
the
slightest
and
refused
our
offer
of
a
canvas
tent
fly
we
never
will
forget
that
first
night
on
the
snow
mountain
as
we
sat
at
dinner
about
the
we
could
see
the
somber
mass
of
the
forest
losing
itself
in
the
darkness
and
felt
the
unseen
presence
of
the
mighty
peaks
standing
guard
about
our
mountain
home
we
slept
breathing
the
strong
sweet
perfume
of
the
spruce
trees
and
dreamed
that
we
two
were
wandering
alone
through
the
forest
opening
the
treasure
boxes
of
the
wild
chapter
xiv
the
first
goral
we
were
awakened
before
daylight
by
wu
long
drawn
call
to
the
hunters
the
steady
drum
of
rain
on
our
tent
shot
a
thrill
of
disappointment
through
me
as
i
opened
my
eyes
but
before
we
had
crawled
out
of
our
and
dressed
it
lessened
to
a
gentle
patter
and
soon
ceased
altogether
it
left
a
cold
gray
morning
with
dense
clouds
weaving
in
and
out
among
the
peaks
but
nevertheless
i
decided
to
go
out
with
the
hunters
to
try
for
goral
two
of
the
men
took
the
dogs
around
the
base
of
a
high
rock
shoulder
sparsely
covered
with
scrub
spruce
while
i
went
up
the
opposite
slope
accompanied
by
the
other
two
we
had
not
been
away
from
camp
half
an
hour
when
the
dogs
began
to
yelp
and
almost
immediately
we
heard
them
coming
around
the
summit
of
the
ridge
in
our
direction
the
hunters
made
frantic
signs
for
me
to
hurry
up
the
steep
slope
but
in
the
thin
air
with
my
heart
pounding
like
a
trip
hammer
i
could
not
go
faster
than
a
walk
we
climbed
about
three
hundred
yards
when
suddenly
the
dogs
appeared
on
the
side
of
the
cliff
near
the
summit
just
in
front
of
them
was
a
bounding
gray
form
the
mist
closed
in
and
we
lost
both
dogs
and
animals
but
ten
minutes
later
a
blessed
gust
of
wind
drifted
the
fog
away
and
the
goral
was
indistinctly
visible
with
its
back
to
a
rock
ledge
facing
the
dogs
the
big
red
leader
of
the
pack
now
and
then
dashed
in
for
a
nip
at
the
animal
throat
but
was
kept
at
bay
by
its
vicious
lunges
and
sharp
horns
illustration
hotenfa
one
of
our
moso
hunters
bringing
in
a
goral
illustration
another
moso
hunter
with
a
porcupine
it
was
nearly
three
hundred
yards
away
but
the
cloud
was
drifting
in
again
and
i
dropped
down
for
a
shot
the
hunters
were
running
up
the
slope
frantically
waving
for
me
to
come
on
thinking
it
madness
to
shoot
at
that
distance
i
could
just
see
the
gray
form
through
the
sights
and
the
first
two
shots
spattered
the
loose
rock
about
a
foot
low
for
the
third
i
got
a
dead
rest
over
a
stone
and
as
the
crash
of
the
little
mannlicher
echoed
up
the
gorge
the
goral
threw
itself
into
the
air
whirling
over
and
over
onto
the
rocks
below
the
hunters
mad
with
excitement
dashed
up
the
hill
and
down
into
the
stream
bed
and
when
i
arrived
the
goral
lay
on
a
grassy
ledge
beside
the
water
the
animal
was
stone
dead
for
my
bullet
had
passed
through
its
lungs
and
although
the
front
teeth
had
been
smashed
on
the
rocks
its
horns
were
uninjured
and
the
beautiful
gray
coat
was
in
perfect
condition
it
so
happened
that
this
ram
was
the
largest
which
we
killed
on
the
entire
trip
when
the
hunters
were
carrying
the
goral
to
camp
we
met
yvette
and
heller
on
their
way
to
visit
the
traps
just
below
snow
line
and
she
returned
with
me
to
photograph
the
animal
and
to
watch
the
ceremonies
which
i
knew
would
be
performed
one
of
the
natives
cut
a
leafy
branch
placed
the
goral
upon
it
and
at
the
first
cut
chanted
a
prayer
then
laying
several
leaves
one
upon
the
other
he
sliced
off
the
tip
of
the
heart
wrapped
it
carefully
in
the
leaves
and
placed
it
in
a
nearby
tree
as
an
offering
to
the
god
of
the
hunt
i
have
often
seen
the
chinese
and
korean
hunters
perform
similar
ceremonies
at
the
death
of
an
animal
and
the
idea
that
it
is
necessary
to
propitiate
the
god
of
the
hunt
is
universal
when
i
was
shooting
in
korea
in
and
also
in
other
parts
of
china
if
luck
had
been
against
us
for
a
few
days
the
hunters
would
invariably
ask
me
to
buy
a
chicken
or
some
animal
to
sacrifice
for
good
joss
after
each
dog
had
had
a
taste
of
the
goral
blood
we
again
climbed
the
cliff
at
the
end
of
the
meadow
when
we
were
nearly
feet
above
camp
the
clouds
shut
in
and
as
the
impenetrable
gray
curtain
wrapped
itself
about
us
we
could
only
sit
quietly
and
wait
for
it
to
drift
away
after
an
hour
the
fog
began
to
thin
and
the
men
sent
the
hounds
toward
a
talus
slope
at
the
base
of
the
highest
peak
almost
immediately
the
big
red
dog
picked
up
a
trail
and
started
across
the
loose
rock
with
the
pack
yelping
at
his
heels
we
followed
as
rapidly
as
possible
over
such
hard
going
but
before
we
reached
the
other
side
the
dogs
had
rounded
a
sharp
pinnacle
and
disappeared
far
below
us
expecting
that
the
goral
would
swing
about
the
base
of
the
peak
the
hunters
sent
me
back
across
the
talus
to
watch
for
a
shot
but
the
animal
ran
down
the
valley
and
into
a
heavily
wooded
ravine
where
the
dogs
lost
his
trail
only
a
short
distance
above
camp
i
returned
to
find
that
heller
had
secured
a
rich
haul
from
the
traps
as
we
supposed
the
runways
which
yvette
and
i
had
discovered
above
timber
line
were
made
by
a
meadow
vole
and
in
the
forest
almost
every
trap
had
caught
a
mouse
he
also
had
several
new
shrews
and
we
caught
eight
different
species
of
these
important
little
animals
at
this
one
camp
wu
the
interpreter
hearing
us
speak
of
shrews
came
to
me
one
day
in
great
perplexity
with
his
dictionary
he
had
looked
up
the
word
shrew
and
found
that
it
meant
a
cantankerous
woman
the
following
day
heller
went
out
with
the
hunters
and
saw
two
gorals
but
did
not
get
a
shot
in
the
meantime
yvette
and
i
ran
the
traps
and
prepared
the
small
mammals
while
we
were
far
up
on
the
baron
appeared
armed
with
ropes
and
an
alpine
snow
ax
he
was
about
to
attempt
to
climb
the
highest
peak
which
had
never
been
ascended
but
the
drifts
turned
him
back
several
hundred
feet
from
the
summit
he
dined
at
our
camp
and
as
all
of
us
carefully
refrained
from
war
talk
we
spent
a
very
pleasant
evening
during
his
three
years
in
he
had
explored
and
mapped
many
sections
of
the
province
which
had
not
been
visited
previously
by
foreigners
and
from
him
we
obtained
much
valuable
information
on
the
third
morning
we
were
up
before
daylight
and
i
left
with
the
hunters
in
the
gray
dawn
we
climbed
steadily
for
an
hour
after
leaving
camp
and
when
well
up
on
the
skirted
the
base
of
a
huge
peak
through
a
dense
forest
of
spruce
and
low
bamboo
thickets
emerging
upon
a
steep
grassy
meadow
this
abutted
on
a
sheer
rock
wall
at
the
upper
end
and
below
ran
into
a
thick
evergreen
forest
as
we
entered
the
meadow
the
big
red
leading
dog
trotted
off
by
himself
toward
the
rock
wall
above
us
and
in
a
few
moments
we
heard
his
sharp
yelps
near
the
summit
instantly
the
pack
was
off
stringing
out
in
a
long
line
up
the
hillside
we
had
nearly
crossed
the
open
slope
and
were
standing
on
the
edge
of
a
deep
gully
when
the
dogs
gave
tongue
and
as
soon
as
the
hunters
were
sure
they
were
coming
in
our
direction
we
hurried
to
the
bottom
of
the
gorge
and
began
the
sharp
ascent
on
the
other
side
it
was
almost
straight
up
and
before
we
had
gone
a
hundred
feet
we
were
all
gasping
for
breath
and
my
legs
seemed
like
bars
of
lead
but
the
staccato
yelps
of
the
dogs
sounding
closer
and
closer
kept
us
going
when
we
finally
dropped
on
the
summit
of
the
hill
i
was
absolutely
done
i
lay
flat
on
my
back
for
a
few
minutes
and
got
to
my
knees
just
as
the
goral
appeared
on
the
opposite
cliff
the
sight
of
the
magnificent
animal
bounding
like
rubber
from
ledges
which
his
feet
seemed
hardly
to
touch
down
the
face
of
a
sheer
wall
will
remain
in
my
memory
as
long
as
i
live
he
seemed
the
very
spirit
of
the
mountains
a
thing
born
of
peaks
and
crags
vibrant
with
the
breath
of
the
clouds
selecting
a
spot
which
he
must
touch
in
the
next
flying
leap
i
waited
until
his
body
darkened
the
sights
and
then
pulled
the
trigger
the
game
little
brute
collapsed
then
struggled
to
his
feet
and
with
a
tremendous
leap
landed
on
a
projecting
shelf
of
rock
four
yards
below
instantly
i
fired
again
and
he
sank
down
in
a
crumpled
gray
mass
not
two
feet
from
the
edge
of
the
precipice
which
fell
away
in
a
dizzy
drop
of
six
hundred
feet
the
dogs
were
on
him
long
before
we
had
worked
our
way
down
the
cañon
and
up
to
the
shelf
where
he
lay
he
was
a
fine
ram
nearly
as
large
as
the
first
one
i
had
killed
i
wanted
to
rest
the
dogs
for
they
were
very
tired
from
their
two
days
of
hunting
so
i
decided
to
return
to
camp
with
the
men
on
the
way
a
second
goral
was
started
but
it
swung
about
the
summit
of
the
wooded
ridge
instead
of
coming
in
my
direction
giving
one
of
the
hunters
a
shot
with
his
crossbow
which
he
missed
it
was
a
beautiful
day
above
us
the
sky
was
clear
and
blue
but
the
clouds
still
lay
thickly
over
the
meadow
and
the
camp
was
invisible
the
billowy
masses
clung
to
the
forest
line
but
from
the
slopes
above
them
we
could
look
far
across
the
valley
into
the
blue
distance
where
the
summits
of
range
after
range
of
magnificent
mountains
lay
shining
in
the
sun
like
beaten
silver
there
was
a
strange
fascination
about
those
mountains
and
i
thrilled
with
the
thought
that
for
twelve
long
months
i
was
free
to
roam
where
i
willed
and
explore
their
hidden
mysteries
chapter
xv
more
gorals
both
gorals
were
fine
old
rams
with
perfect
horns
their
hair
was
thick
and
soft
pale
tipped
with
brownish
and
the
legs
on
the
cannon
bones
were
like
the
margins
of
the
throat
patches
their
color
made
them
practically
invisible
against
the
rocks
and
when
i
killed
the
second
goral
my
only
distinct
impression
as
he
dashed
down
the
face
of
the
precipice
was
of
four
yellowish
legs
entirely
separated
from
a
body
which
i
could
hardly
see
this
invisibility
combined
with
the
fact
that
the
snow
mountain
gorals
lived
on
almost
inaccessible
cliffs
thickly
covered
with
scrub
spruce
forest
made
still
hunting
impossible
in
fact
baron
who
had
explored
this
part
of
the
snow
mountains
fairly
thoroughly
in
his
search
for
plants
had
never
seen
a
goral
and
did
not
know
that
such
an
animal
existed
there
heller
hunted
for
two
days
in
succession
and
although
he
saw
several
gorals
he
was
not
successful
in
getting
one
until
we
had
been
in
camp
almost
a
week
his
was
a
young
male
not
more
than
a
year
old
with
horns
about
an
inch
long
it
was
a
valuable
addition
to
our
collection
for
i
was
anxious
to
obtain
specimens
of
various
ages
to
be
mounted
as
a
habitat
group
in
the
museum
and
we
lacked
only
a
female
the
preparation
of
the
group
required
the
greatest
care
and
study
first
we
selected
a
proper
spot
to
reproduce
in
the
museum
and
yvette
took
a
series
of
natural
color
photographs
to
guide
the
artist
in
painting
the
background
next
she
made
detail
photographs
of
the
surroundings
then
we
collected
portions
of
the
rocks
and
typical
bits
of
vegetation
such
as
moss
and
leaves
to
be
either
dried
or
preserved
in
formalin
in
a
large
group
perhaps
several
thousand
leaves
will
be
required
but
the
field
naturalist
need
select
typical
specimens
of
only
five
or
six
different
sizes
from
each
of
which
a
plaster
mold
can
be
made
at
the
museum
and
the
leaves
reproduced
in
wax
after
two
days
of
rain
during
which
i
had
a
hard
and
unsuccessful
hunt
for
serows
we
decided
to
return
to
the
temple
at
the
foot
of
the
mountain
which
was
nearer
to
the
forests
inhabited
by
these
animals
we
had
already
been
in
our
camp
on
the
meadow
for
nine
days
and
besides
the
gorals
had
gathered
a
large
and
valuable
collection
of
small
mammals
the
shrews
were
especially
varied
in
species
and
besides
a
splendid
series
of
meadow
voles
asiatic
mice
and
rats
we
obtained
a
new
weasel
and
a
single
specimen
of
a
tiny
or
little
chief
hare
an
asiatic
genus
which
is
also
found
in
the
western
part
of
north
america
on
the
high
slopes
of
the
rocky
mountains
although
we
set
dozens
of
traps
among
the
rocks
we
did
not
get
another
on
the
entire
expedition
nor
did
we
see
indications
of
their
presence
in
other
localities
the
almost
complete
absence
of
carnivores
at
this
camp
was
a
great
surprise
except
for
weasels
we
saw
no
others
and
the
hunters
said
that
foxes
or
civets
did
not
occur
on
this
side
of
the
mountain
even
though
food
was
abundant
on
the
day
before
we
went
to
the
temple
i
had
a
magnificent
hunt
we
left
camp
at
daylight
in
a
heavy
fog
and
almost
at
once
the
dogs
took
up
a
serow
trail
we
heard
them
coming
toward
us
as
we
stood
at
the
upper
edge
of
a
little
meadow
and
expected
the
animal
to
break
cover
any
moment
but
it
turned
down
the
mountain
and
the
hounds
lost
the
trail
in
the
thick
spruce
woods
we
climbed
slowly
toward
the
cliffs
until
we
were
well
above
the
clouds
which
lay
in
a
thick
white
blanket
over
the
camp
and
headed
for
the
cañon
where
i
had
shot
my
second
goral
hotenfa
wished
to
go
lower
down
into
the
forests
but
i
prevailed
upon
him
to
stay
along
the
open
slopes
and
while
we
were
resting
the
big
red
dog
suddenly
gave
tongue
on
a
ridge
above
and
to
the
right
of
us
it
was
in
the
exact
spot
where
my
second
goral
had
been
started
and
we
were
on
the
when
the
rest
of
the
pack
dashed
up
the
to
join
their
leader
in
a
few
moments
they
all
gave
tongue
and
we
heard
them
swinging
about
in
our
direction
just
then
the
clouds
which
had
been
lying
in
a
solid
bank
below
us
began
to
drift
upward
in
a
long
thin
finger
toward
the
cañon
on
and
on
it
came
and
closer
sounded
the
yelps
of
the
dogs
i
was
trembling
with
impatience
and
swearing
softly
as
the
gray
vapor
streamed
into
the
gorge
the
cloud
thickened
sweeping
rapidly
up
the
ravine
until
we
were
enveloped
so
completely
that
i
could
hardly
see
the
length
of
my
gun
barrel
a
moment
later
we
heard
the
goral
leaping
down
the
cliff
not
a
hundred
yards
away
with
the
rifle
useless
in
my
hands
i
listened
to
each
hoof
beat
and
the
stones
which
his
flying
feet
sent
rattling
into
the
gorge
then
the
dogs
came
past
and
we
heard
them
follow
down
the
rocks
their
yelps
growing
fainter
and
fainter
in
the
valley
far
below
the
goral
was
lost
and
as
though
the
fates
were
laughing
at
us
ten
minutes
later
a
puff
of
wind
sucked
the
cloud
out
of
the
cañon
as
swiftly
as
it
had
come
and
above
us
shone
a
sky
as
clear
and
blue
as
a
tropic
sea
hotenfa
disgust
more
than
equaled
my
own
for
i
had
loaned
him
my
gun
gauge
and
savage
and
he
was
as
excited
as
a
child
with
a
new
toy
he
was
a
remarkably
intelligent
man
and
mastered
the
safety
catches
in
a
short
time
even
though
he
had
never
before
seen
a
gun
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
hurry
down
the
mountain
for
the
dogs
might
bring
the
goral
to
bay
on
one
of
the
cliffs
below
us
and
in
twenty
minutes
we
stood
on
a
ridge
which
jutted
out
from
the
thick
spruce
forest
one
of
the
hunters
picked
his
way
down
the
rock
wall
while
hotenfa
and
i
circled
the
top
of
the
spur
we
had
not
gone
a
hundred
yards
when
the
hunter
shouted
that
a
goral
was
running
in
our
direction
hotenfa
reached
the
edge
of
the
ridge
before
me
and
i
saw
him
fire
with
the
gun
at
a
goral
which
disappeared
into
the
brush
his
bullet
struck
the
dirt
only
a
few
feet
behind
the
animal
although
it
must
have
been
well
beyond
a
hundred
yards
and
almost
straight
below
us
hardly
had
we
drawn
back
when
a
yell
from
the
other
hunter
brought
us
again
to
the
edge
of
the
cliff
just
in
time
to
see
a
second
goral
dash
into
the
forest
a
good
three
hundred
yards
away
in
the
very
bottom
of
the
gorge
rather
disappointed
we
continued
along
the
ridge
and
hotenfa
made
signs
which
said
as
plainly
as
words
i
told
you
so
the
gorals
are
not
on
the
peaks
but
down
in
the
forest
we
ought
to
have
come
here
first
there
were
not
many
moments
for
regret
however
for
this
was
our
busy
day
suddenly
a
burst
of
frantic
yelps
from
the
red
dog
turned
us
off
to
the
left
and
we
heard
him
nearing
the
summit
of
the
spur
which
we
had
just
left
one
of
the
other
hunters
was
standing
there
and
his
crossbow
twanged
as
the
goral
passed
only
a
few
yards
from
him
but
the
wicked
little
poisoned
dart
stuck
quivering
into
a
tree
a
few
inches
above
the
animal
back
the
goral
dashed
over
the
ridge
almost
on
top
of
the
second
hunter
who
was
too
surprised
to
shoot
and
only
yelled
that
it
was
coming
toward
us
on
the
cliff
below
hotenfa
leaped
from
rock
to
rock
almost
like
a
goat
himself
and
dashed
through
the
bushes
toward
a
jutting
shelf
which
overhung
the
gorge
we
reached
the
rim
at
the
same
moment
and
saw
a
huge
ram
standing
on
a
narrow
ledge
a
hundred
yards
below
i
fired
instantly
and
the
noble
animal
with
feet
wide
spread
and
head
thrown
back
launched
himself
into
space
falling
six
hundred
feet
to
the
rocks
beneath
us
as
the
goral
leaped
hotenfa
seemed
suddenly
to
go
insane
yelling
with
joy
he
threw
his
arms
about
my
neck
rubbing
my
face
with
his
and
pounding
me
on
the
back
until
i
thought
he
would
throw
us
both
off
the
cliff
i
was
utterly
dumbfounded
but
seized
his
gun
to
unload
it
for
in
his
excitement
there
was
imminent
danger
that
he
would
shoot
either
himself
or
me
then
i
realized
what
it
was
all
about
we
had
both
fired
simultaneously
and
neither
had
heard
the
other
shot
by
mistake
hotenfa
had
discharged
a
load
of
buckshot
and
it
was
my
bullet
which
had
killed
the
goral
but
his
joy
was
so
great
that
i
would
not
for
anything
have
disillusioned
him
it
was
a
half
hour
hard
work
to
get
to
the
place
where
the
goral
had
fallen
the
dogs
were
already
there
lying
quietly
beside
the
animal
when
we
arrived
my
bullet
had
entered
the
back
just
in
front
of
the
hind
leg
and
ranged
forward
through
the
lungs
flattening
itself
against
the
breast
bone
the
jacket
had
split
one
piece
tearing
into
the
heart
so
that
the
ram
was
probably
dead
before
it
struck
the
rocks
i
photographed
the
goral
where
it
lay
and
after
it
had
been
eviscerated
and
the
hunters
had
performed
their
ceremonies
to
the
god
of
the
hunt
i
sent
one
of
them
back
with
it
while
hotenfa
and
i
worked
toward
the
bottom
of
the
cañon
in
the
hope
of
finding
the
other
animals
it
was
a
delightfully
warm
day
and
hotenfa
told
me
in
his
vivid
sign
language
that
the
gorals
were
likely
to
be
asleep
on
the
sunny
side
of
the
ravine
therefore
we
worked
up
the
opposite
slope
it
was
the
hardest
kind
of
climbing
and
for
two
hours
we
plodded
steadily
upward
clinging
by
feet
and
hands
to
bushes
and
rocks
and
were
almost
exhausted
when
we
reached
a
small
open
patch
of
grass
about
two
thirds
of
the
way
to
the
summit
we
rested
for
half
an
hour
and
after
a
light
tiffin
toiled
on
again
i
had
not
gone
thirty
feet
and
hotenfa
was
still
sitting
down
when
i
saw
him
wave
his
arm
excitedly
and
throw
up
his
gun
to
shoot
i
leaped
down
to
his
side
just
as
he
fired
at
a
big
female
goral
which
was
sound
asleep
in
an
open
patch
of
grass
on
the
hotenfa
bullet
broke
the
animal
foreleg
at
the
knee
but
without
the
slightest
sign
of
injury
she
dashed
down
the
cliff
i
fired
as
she
ran
striking
her
squarely
in
the
heart
and
she
pitched
headlong
into
the
bushes
a
hundred
feet
below
how
hotenfa
managed
to
pack
that
animal
to
the
summit
of
the
ridge
i
never
can
understand
for
with
a
light
sack
upon
my
back
and
a
rifle
it
was
all
i
could
do
to
pull
myself
up
the
rocks
he
was
completely
done
when
we
finally
threw
ourselves
on
the
grass
at
the
edge
of
the
meadow
which
we
had
left
in
the
morning
hotenfa
chanted
his
prayer
when
we
opened
the
goral
but
the
god
of
the
hunt
missed
his
offering
for
my
bullet
had
smashed
the
heart
to
a
pulp
on
our
way
back
to
camp
the
red
dog
although
dead
tired
disappeared
alone
into
the
heavy
forest
below
us
suddenly
we
heard
his
deep
bay
coming
up
the
hill
in
our
direction
hotenfa
and
i
dropped
our
burdens
and
ran
to
an
opening
in
the
forest
where
we
thought
the
animal
must
pass
instead
of
coming
out
where
we
expected
the
dog
appeared
higher
up
at
the
heels
of
a
crested
muntjac
which
was
bounding
along
at
full
speed
its
white
flag
standing
straight
up
over
its
dark
bluish
back
i
had
one
chance
for
a
shot
at
about
one
hundred
and
fifty
yards
as
the
pair
crossed
a
little
opening
in
the
trees
but
it
was
too
dangerous
to
shoot
for
had
i
missed
the
deer
the
dog
certainly
would
have
been
killed
illustration
a
typical
goral
cliff
on
the
snow
mountain
i
was
over
losing
this
animal
for
it
is
an
exceedingly
rare
species
but
a
few
days
later
a
shepherd
brought
in
another
which
had
been
wounded
by
one
of
our
lolo
hunters
and
had
run
down
into
the
plains
to
die
when
we
reached
the
hill
above
camp
yvette
ran
out
to
meet
us
falling
over
logs
and
bushes
in
her
eagerness
to
see
what
we
were
carrying
no
dinner
which
i
have
ever
eaten
tasted
like
the
one
we
had
of
goral
steak
that
night
and
after
a
smoke
i
crawled
into
my
sleeping
bag
dead
tired
in
body
but
with
a
happy
heart
chapter
xvi
the
snow
mountain
temple
on
october
we
moved
to
the
foot
of
the
mountain
and
camped
in
the
temple
which
we
had
formerly
occupied
this
was
directly
below
the
forests
inhabited
by
serow
and
we
expected
to
devote
our
efforts
exclusively
toward
obtaining
a
representative
series
of
these
animals
unfortunately
i
developed
a
severe
infection
in
the
palm
of
my
right
hand
almost
immediately
and
had
it
not
been
for
the
devoted
care
of
my
wife
i
should
not
have
left
china
alive
through
terrible
nights
of
delirium
when
the
poison
was
threatening
to
spread
over
my
entire
body
she
nursed
me
with
an
utter
disregard
of
her
own
health
and
slept
only
during
a
few
restless
hours
of
complete
exhaustion
for
three
weeks
i
could
do
no
work
but
at
last
was
able
to
bend
my
trigger
finger
and
resume
hunting
although
i
did
not
entirely
recover
the
use
of
my
hand
for
several
months
however
the
work
of
the
expedition
by
no
means
ceased
because
of
my
illness
heller
continued
to
collect
small
mammals
with
great
energy
and
the
day
after
we
arrived
at
the
temple
we
engaged
eight
new
native
hunters
these
were
lolos
a
wandering
unit
from
the
independent
tribe
of
and
they
proved
to
be
excellent
men
the
first
serow
was
killed
by
hotenfa
party
on
our
third
day
in
the
temple
heller
went
out
with
the
hunters
but
in
a
few
hours
returned
alone
a
short
time
after
he
had
left
the
natives
the
dogs
took
up
the
trail
of
a
huge
serow
and
followed
it
for
three
miles
through
the
spruce
forest
they
finally
brought
the
animal
to
bay
against
a
cliff
and
a
furious
fight
ensued
one
dog
was
ripped
wide
open
another
received
a
in
the
side
and
the
big
red
leader
was
thrown
over
a
cliff
to
the
rocks
below
more
of
the
hounds
undoubtedly
would
have
been
killed
had
not
the
hunters
arrived
and
shot
the
animal
the
men
brought
the
serow
in
late
at
night
but
our
joy
was
considerably
dampened
by
the
loss
of
the
red
dog
hotenfa
carried
him
in
his
arms
and
laid
him
gently
on
a
blanket
in
the
temple
but
the
splendid
animal
died
during
the
night
his
master
cried
like
a
child
and
i
am
sure
that
he
felt
more
real
sorrow
than
he
would
have
shown
at
the
loss
of
his
wife
for
wives
are
much
easier
to
get
in
china
than
good
hunting
dogs
the
serow
was
an
adult
male
badly
scarred
from
fighting
and
had
lost
one
horn
by
falling
over
a
cliff
when
he
was
killed
he
was
brownish
black
with
rusty
red
lower
legs
and
a
whitish
mane
his
right
horn
was
nine
and
inches
in
length
and
five
and
inches
in
circumference
at
the
base
and
the
effectiveness
with
which
he
had
used
his
horns
against
the
dogs
demonstrated
that
they
were
by
no
means
only
for
ornaments
in
the
next
chapter
the
habits
and
relationships
of
the
gorals
and
serows
will
be
considered
more
fully
on
the
morning
following
the
capture
of
the
first
serow
the
last
rain
of
the
season
began
and
continued
for
nine
days
almost
without
ceasing
the
weather
made
hunting
practically
impossible
for
the
fog
hung
so
thickly
over
the
woods
that
one
could
not
see
a
hundred
feet
and
heller
found
that
many
of
his
small
traps
were
sprung
by
the
raindrops
the
lolos
had
disappeared
and
we
believed
that
they
had
returned
to
their
village
but
they
had
been
hunting
in
spite
of
the
weather
and
on
the
fifth
day
arrived
with
a
fine
male
serow
in
perfect
condition
it
showed
a
most
interesting
color
variation
for
instead
of
red
the
lower
legs
were
buff
with
hardly
a
tinge
of
reddish
november
the
sun
rose
in
an
absolutely
cloudless
sky
and
during
the
remainder
of
the
winter
we
had
as
perfect
weather
as
one
could
wish
yvette
constant
mussing
and
efficient
surgery
combined
with
the
devotion
of
our
interpreter
wu
had
checked
the
spread
of
the
poison
in
my
hand
and
my
nights
were
no
longer
haunted
with
the
strange
fancies
of
delirium
but
i
was
as
helpless
as
a
babe
i
could
do
nothing
but
sit
with
steaming
cloths
wrapped
about
my
arm
and
rail
at
the
fate
which
kept
me
useless
in
the
temple
the
lolos
killed
a
third
serow
on
the
mountain
just
above
our
camp
but
the
animal
fell
into
a
rock
fissure
more
than
a
hundred
feet
deep
and
was
recovered
only
after
a
day
hard
work
the
men
wove
a
swinging
ladder
from
tough
vines
climbed
down
it
and
drew
the
serow
bodily
up
the
cliff
as
it
weighed
nearly
three
hundred
pounds
this
was
by
no
means
an
easy
undertaking
our
lolo
hunters
were
tall
handsome
fellows
led
by
a
slender
young
chief
with
patrician
features
who
ruled
his
village
like
an
autocrat
with
absolute
power
of
life
and
death
the
lolos
are
a
strange
people
who
at
one
time
probably
occupied
much
of
the
region
south
of
the
yangtze
river
but
were
pushed
south
and
west
by
the
chinese
and
except
in
one
instance
now
exist
only
in
scattered
units
in
the
provinces
of
and
in
the
lolos
hold
a
vast
territory
which
is
absolutely
closed
to
the
chinese
on
pain
of
death
and
over
which
they
exercise
no
control
several
expeditions
have
been
launched
against
the
lolos
but
all
have
ended
in
disaster
only
a
few
weeks
before
we
arrived
in
a
number
of
chinese
soldiers
butchered
nearly
a
hundred
lolos
whom
they
had
encountered
outside
the
independent
territory
and
in
reprisal
the
lolos
burned
several
villages
almost
under
the
walls
of
a
fortified
city
in
which
were
five
hundred
soldiers
massacred
all
the
men
and
boys
and
carried
off
the
women
as
slaves
the
pure
blood
lolos
are
a
very
fine
tall
race
with
comparatively
fair
complexions
and
often
with
straight
features
suggesting
a
mixture
of
mongolian
with
some
more
race
their
appearance
marks
them
as
closely
connected
by
race
with
the
eastern
tibetans
the
latter
being
if
anything
rather
the
bigger
men
of
the
two
they
are
great
wanderers
and
over
a
very
large
part
of
form
the
bulk
of
the
hill
population
being
the
most
numerous
of
all
the
tribes
in
the
province
footnote
the

major
davies
p
like
almost
every
race
which
has
been
conquered
by
the
chinese
or
has
come
into
continual
contact
with
them
for
a
few
generations
the
lolos
of
where
they
are
in
isolated
villages
are
being
absorbed
by
the
chinese
we
found
as
did
major
davies
that
in
some
instances
they
were
giving
up
their
language
and
beginning
to
talk
chinese
even
among
themselves
the
women
already
had
begun
to
tie
up
their
feet
in
the
chinese
fashion
and
even
disliked
to
be
called
lolos
those
whom
we
employed
were
living
entirely
by
hunting
and
although
we
found
them
amiable
enough
they
were
exceedingly
independent
they
preferred
to
hunt
alone
although
they
recognized
what
an
increased
chance
for
game
our
rifles
gave
them
and
eventually
left
us
while
i
was
away
on
a
short
trip
even
though
we
still
owed
them
considerable
money
the
lolos
are
only
one
of
the
tribes
of
major
davies
has
considered
this
question
in
his
valuable
book
to
which
i
have
already
referred
and
i
can
not
do
better
than
quote
his
remarks
here
the
numerous
tribes
that
the
traveler
encounters
in
western
china
form
perhaps
one
of
the
most
interesting
features
of
travel
in
that
country
it
is
safe
to
assert
that
in
hardly
any
other
part
of
the
world
is
there
such
a
large
variety
of
languages
and
dialects
as
are
to
be
heard
in
the
country
which
lies
between
assam
and
the
eastern
border
of
and
in
the
countries
to
the
south
of
this
region
the
reason
of
this
is
not
hard
to
find
it
lies
in
the
physical
characteristics
of
the
country
it
is
the
high
mountain
ranges
and
the
deep
rivers
that
have
brought
about
the
differences
in
customs
and
language
and
the
innumerable
tribal
distinctions
which
are
so
perplexing
to
the
enquirer
into
ethnology
a
tribe
has
entered
from
their
original
himalayan
or
tibetan
home
and
after
increasing
in
numbers
have
found
the
land
they
have
settled
on
not
equal
to
their
wants
the
natural
result
has
been
the
emigration
of
part
of
the
colony
the
emigrants
having
surmounted
pathless
mountains
and
crossed
unbridged
rivers
on
extemporized
rafts
have
found
a
new
place
to
settle
in
and
have
felt
no
inclination
to
undertake
such
a
journey
again
to
revisit
their
old
home
being
without
a
written
character
in
which
to
preserve
their
traditions
cut
off
from
all
civilizing
influence
of
the
outside
world
and
occupied
merely
in
growing
crops
enough
to
support
themselves
the
recollection
of
their
connection
with
their
original
ancestors
has
died
out
it
is
not
then
surprising
that
they
should
now
consider
themselves
a
totally
distinct
race
from
the
parent
stock
wars
and
the
practice
of
slave
raiding
so
common
among
the
wilder
members
of
the
family
have
helped
to
still
further
widen
the
breach
in
fact
it
may
be
considered
remarkable
that
after
being
separated
for
hundreds
and
perhaps
in
some
case
for
thousands
of
years
the
languages
of
two
distant
tribes
of
the
same
family
should
bear
to
each
other
the
marked
general
resemblance
which
is
still
to
be
found
the
hilly
nature
of
the
country
and
the
consequent
lack
of
good
means
of
communication
have
also
naturally
militated
against
the
formation
of
any
large
kingdoms
with
effective
control
over
the
mountainous
districts
directly
we
get
to
a
flat
country
with
good
roads
and
navigable
rivers
we
find
the
tribal
distinctions
disappear
and
the
whole
of
the
inhabitants
are
welded
into
a
homogeneous
people
under
a
settled
government
speaking
one
language
burmese
as
heard
throughout
the
irrawaddy
valley
is
the
same
everywhere
a
traveler
from
rangoon
to
bhamo
will
find
one
language
spoken
throughout
his
journey
but
an
expedition
of
the
same
length
in
the
hilly
country
to
the
east
or
to
the
west
of
the
irrawaddy
valley
would
bring
him
into
contact
with
twenty
mutually
unintelligible

the

of

gorals
and
serows
gorals
and
serows
belong
to
the
subfamily
which
is
an
early
offshoot
of
the
it
also
includes
the
chamois
takin
and
the
rocky
mountain
goat
of
america
the
animals
are
commonly
referred
to
as
in
order
to
express
the
intermediate
position
which
they
apparently
hold
between
the
goats
and
antelopes
they
are
also
sometimes
called
the
rupicaprine
antelopes
from
the
scientific
name
of
the
chamois
the
horns
of
all
members
of
the
group
are
finely
ridged
subcylindrical
and
are
present
in
both
sexes
being
almost
as
long
in
the
female
as
in
the
male
although
no
one
would
suspect
that
the
gorals
are
more
closely
related
to
the
takins
than
to
the
serows
which
they
resemble
superficially
such
seems
to
be
the
case
but
the
cranial
differences
between
the
two
genera
are
to
a
certain
extent
bridged
over
by
the
skull
of
the
small
japanese
serow
this
species
is
most
interesting
because
of
its
intermediate
position
in
size
it
is
larger
than
a
goral
but
smaller
than
a
serow
its
long
coat
and
its
horns
resemble
those
of
a
goral
but
it
has
the
face
gland
and
short
tail
of
a
serow
it
is
found
in
japan
manchuria
and
southern
siberia
the
principal
external
difference
between
the
gorals
and
serows
besides
that
of
size
is
in
the
fact
that
the
serows
have
a
short
tail
and
a
well
developed
face
gland
which
opens
in
front
of
the
eyes
by
a
small
orifice
while
the
gorals
have
a
long
tail
and
no
such
gland

the
serows
are
similar
to
some
of
the
antelopes
but
in
their
clumsy
build
heavy
limbs
and
stout
hoofs
as
well
as
in
habits
they
resemble
goats
the
serow
has
a
long
face
and
because
of
its
enormous
ears
the
chinese
in
fukien
province
refer
to
it
as
the
wild
donkey
but
in
it
is
called
wild
cow
the
specific
relationships
of
the
serows
are
by
no
means
satisfactorily
determined
pocock
superintendent
of
the
london
zoölogical
society
gardens
has
recently
devoted
considerable
study
to
the
serows
of
british
india
and
considers
them
all
to
be
races
of
the
single
species
with
this
opinion
i
am
inclined
to
agree
although
i
have
not
yet
had
sufficient
time
in
which
to
thoroughly
study
the
subject
in
the
light
of
our
new
material
these
animals
differ
most
strikingly
in
external
coloration
and
fall
into
three
groups
all
of
which
partake
more
or
less
of
the
characters
of
each
other
chinese
serows
usually
have
the
lower
legs
rusty
red
while
in
indian
races
they
are
whitish
and
black
in
the
southern
burma
and
malayan
forms
the
serows
which
we
killed
upon
the
snow
mountain
can
probably
be
referred
to
sumatrensis
those
of
fukien
obtained
by
caldwell
represent
the
serow
sumatrensis
and
one
which
i
shot
in
may
near
not
far
from
the
burma
frontier
is
apparently
an
undescribed
form
our
specimens
have
brought
out
the
fact
that
a
remarkable
individual
variation
exists
in
the
color
of
the
legs
of
these
animals
this
character
was
considered
to
be
of
diagnostic
value
and
probably
is
in
some
degree
but
it
is
by
no
means
as
reliable
as
it
was
formerly
supposed
to
be
two
of
the
serows
killed
on
the
snow
mountain
have
the
lower
legs
rusty
red
while
in
two
others
these
parts
are
buff
colored
the
animals
all
males
of
nearly
the
same
age
were
taken
on
the
same
mountain
and
virtually
at
the
same
time
their
skulls
exhibit
no
important
differences
and
there
is
no
reason
to
believe
that
they
represent
anything
but
an
extreme
individual
variation
the
two
specimens
obtained
by
caldwell
at
are
even
more
surprising
the
old
female
is
coal
black
but
the
young
male
is
distinctly
with
a
chestnut
stripe
from
the
mane
to
the
tail
along
the
line
where
the
hairs
of
the
back
form
a
ridge
the
horns
of
the
female
are
nearly
parallel
for
half
their
extent
and
approach
each
other
at
the
tips
their
surfaces
are
remarkably
smooth
the
horns
of
the
young
male
diverge
like
a
v
from
the
skull
and
are
very
heavily
ridged
the
latter
character
is
undoubtedly
due
to
youth
these
serows
are
an
excellent
example
of
the
necessity
for
collecting
a
large
number
of
specimens
from
the
same
locality
only
by
this
means
is
it
possible
to
learn
how
the
species
is
affected
by
age
sex
and
individual
variation
and
what
are
its
really
important
characters
in
the
case
of
the
gorals
our
expedition
obtained
at
such
a
splendid
series
of
all
ages
that
we
have
an
unequaled
opportunity
for
intelligent
study
serows
are
entirely
asian
and
found
in
china
japan
india
sumatra
and
the
malay
peninsula
on
the
snow
mountain
we
found
them
living
singly
at
altitudes
of
from
to
feet
in
dense
spruce
forests
among
the
cliffs
the
animals
seemed
to
be
fond
of
sleeping
under
overhanging
rocks
and
we
were
constantly
finding
beds
which
gave
evidence
of
very
extensive
use
apparently
serows
seldom
come
out
into
the
open
but
feed
on
leaves
and
grass
while
in
the
thickest
cover
so
that
it
is
almost
impossible
to
kill
them
without
the
aid
of
dogs
or
beaters
sometimes
a
serow
will
lead
the
dogs
for
three
or
four
miles
and
eventually
lose
them
or
it
may
turn
at
bay
and
fight
the
pack
after
only
a
short
chase
a
large
serow
is
almost
certain
to
kill
several
of
the
hounds
if
in
a
favorable
position
with
a
rock
wall
at
its
back
the
animal
can
use
its
strong
curved
horns
with
deadly
effect
for
it
is
remarkably
agile
for
a
beast
of
its
size
in
fukien
we
hunted
serows
on
the
summit
of
a
high
mountain
clothed
with
a
dense
jungle
of
dwarf
bamboo
it
was
in
quite
different
country
from
that
which
the
animals
inhabit
in
for
although
the
cover
was
exceedingly
thick
it
was
without
such
high
cliffs
and
there
were
extensive
grassy
meadows
we
did
not
see
any
serows
in
fukien
because
of
the
ignorance
of
our
beaters
although
the
trails
were
cut
by
fresh
tracks
the
natives
said
that
in
late
september
the
animals
could
often
be
found
in
the
forests
of
the
lower
mountain
slopes
when
they
came
to
browse
upon
the
new
grown
mushrooms
caldwell
purchased
for
us
in
the
market
the
skin
of
a
splendid
female
serow
and
a
short
time
later
obtained
a
young
male
the
latter
was
seen
swimming
across
the
river
just
below
the
city
wall
and
was
caught
alive
by
the
natives
the
female
weighed
three
hundred
and
ten
pounds
and
the
male
two
hundred
and
ninety
pounds
serows
are
rare
in
captivity
and
are
said
to
be
rather
dangerous
pets
unless
tamed
when
very
young
we
are
reproducing
a
photograph
taken
and
kindly
loaned
by
herbert
lang
of
one
formerly
living
in
the
berlin
zoölogical
garden
we
saw
a
serow
in
the
zoölogical
park
at
calcutta
and
one
from
darjeeling
is
owned
by
the
london
zoölogical
society
gorals
are
pretty
little
animals
of
the
size
of
the
chamois
the
species
which
we
killed
on
the
snow
mountain
can
probably
be
referred
to
but
i
have
not
yet
had
an
opportunity
to
study
our
specimens
carefully
unlike
the
serows
these
gorals
have
blackish
brown
tails
which
from
the
roots
to
the
end
of
the
hairs
measure
about
inches
in
length
the
horns
of
both
sexes
are
prominently
ridged
for
the
basal
half
of
their
length
and
perfectly
smooth
distally
the
male
horns
are
strongly
recurved
and
are
thick
and
round
at
the
base
but
narrow
rapidly
to
the
tips
the
female
horns
are
straighter
and
more
slender
the
longest
horns
in
the
series
which
we
received
measured
six
inches
in
length
and
three
and
inches
in
circumference
at
the
base
like
the
serows
gorals
are
confined
to
asia
and
are
found
in
northern
india
burma
and
china
and
northwards
through
korea
and
southern
manchuria
we
hunted
gorals
with
dogs
on
the
snow
mountain
for
in
this
particular
region
they
could
be
killed
in
no
other
way
there
was
so
much
cover
even
at
altitudes
of
from
to
feet
and
the
rocks
were
so
precipitous
that
a
man
might
spend
a
month
still
hunting
and
never
see
a
goral
they
are
vicious
fighters
and
often
back
up
to
a
cliff
where
they
can
keep
the
dogs
at
a
distance
one
of
our
best
hounds
while
hunting
alone
brought
a
goral
to
bay
and
was
found
dead
next
day
by
the
hunters
with
its
side
ripped
open
on
the
snow
mountain
we
found
the
animals
singly
but
at
not
far
from
the
burma
frontier
where
we
hunted
another
species
in
the
spring
they
were
almost
universally
in
herds
of
from
six
to
seven
or
eight
it
was
at
the
latter
place
that
we
had
our
best
opportunity
to
observe
gorals
and
learn
something
of
their
habits
we
were
camping
on
the
banks
of
a
branch
of
the
shweli
river
which
had
cut
a
narrow
gorge
for
itself
on
one
side
this
was
seven
or
eight
hundred
feet
deep
a
herd
of
about
fifty
gorals
had
been
living
for
many
years
on
one
of
the
mountain
sides
not
far
from
the
village
and
although
they
were
seen
constantly
the
natives
had
no
weapons
with
which
to
kill
them
but
with
our
rifles
it
was
possible
to
shoot
across
the
river
at
distances
of
from
two
hundred
to
four
hundred
yards
we
could
scan
every
inch
of
the
hillside
through
our
field
glasses
and
watch
the
gorals
as
they
moved
about
quite
unconscious
of
our
presence
at
this
place
they
were
feeding
almost
exclusively
upon
the
leaves
of
low
bushes
and
the
new
grass
which
had
sprung
up
where
the
slopes
had
been
partly
burned
over
we
found
them
browsing
from
daylight
until
about
nine
and
from
four
in
the
afternoon
until
dark
they
would
move
slowly
among
the
bushes
picking
off
the
new
leaves
and
usually
about
the
middle
of
the
morning
would
choose
a
place
where
the
sun
beat
in
warmly
upon
the
rocks
and
go
to
sleep
strangely
enough
they
did
not
lie
down
on
their
sides
as
do
many
hoofed
animals
but
doubled
their
forelegs
under
them
stretched
their
necks
and
hind
legs
straight
out
and
rested
on
their
bellies
it
was
a
most
uncomfortable
looking
attitude
and
the
first
time
i
saw
an
animal
resting
thus
i
thought
it
had
been
wounded
but
both
heller
and
myself
saw
them
repeatedly
at
other
times
and
realized
that
this
was
their
natural
position
when
asleep
when
frightened
like
our
own
mountain
sheep
or
goats
they
would
run
a
short
distance
and
stop
to
look
back
this
was
usually
their
undoing
for
they
offered
excellent
targets
as
they
stood
silhouetted
against
the
sky
they
were
very
difficult
to
see
when
lying
down
among
the
rocks
but
our
native
hunters
who
had
most
extraordinary
eyesight
often
would
discover
them
when
it
was
almost
impossible
for
me
to
find
them
even
with
the
field
glasses
we
never
could
be
sure
that
there
were
no
gorals
on
a
for
they
were
adepts
at
hiding
and
made
use
of
a
bunch
of
grass
or
the
smallest
crevice
in
a
rock
to
conceal
themselves
and
did
it
so
completely
that
they
seemed
to
have
vanished
from
the
earth
like
all
sheep
and
goats
they
could
climb
about
where
it
seemed
impossible
for
any
animal
to
move
i
have
seen
a
goral
run
down
the
face
of
a
cliff
which
appeared
to
be
almost
perpendicular
and
where
the
dogs
dared
not
venture
as
the
animal
landed
on
a
projecting
rock
it
would
bounce
off
as
though
made
of
rubber
and
leap
eight
or
ten
feet
to
a
narrow
ledge
which
did
not
seem
large
enough
to
support
a
rabbit
the
ability
to
travel
down
such
precipitous
cliffs
is
largely
due
to
the
animal
foot
structure
professor
henry
fairfield
osborn
has
investigated
this
matter
in
the
mountain
goat
and
as
his
remarks
apply
almost
equally
well
to
the
goral
i
can
not
do
better
than
quote
them
here
the
horny
part
of
the
foot
surrounds
only
the
extreme
front
behind
this
crescentic
horn
is
a
shallow
concavity
which
gives
the
horny
hoof
a
chance
to
get
its
hold
both
the
main
digits
and
the
dewclaws
terminate
in
black
rounded
and
expanded
soles
which
are
of
great
service
in
securing
a
firm
footing
on
the
shelving
rocks
and
narrow
ledges
on
which
the
animal
travels
with
such
ease
this
sole
smith
states
softens
in
the
spring
of
the
year
when
the
snow
is
leaving
the
ground
a
fresh
layer
of
the
integument
taking
its
place
the
balls
with
which
the
dewclaws
are
provided
are
by
no
means
useless
they
project
back
below
the
horny
part
of
the
hoof
and
smith
has
actually
observed
the
young
captive
goats
supporting
themselves
solely
on
their
dewclaws
on
the
edge
of
a
roof
it
is
probable
that
they
are
similarly
used
on
the
rocks
and
precipices
since
on
a
very
narrow
ledge
they
would
serve
favorably
to
alter
the
center
of
gravity
by
enabling
the
limb
to
be
extended
somewhat
farther
forward

mountain
goat
hunting
with
the
camera
by
henry
fairfield
osborn
reprinted
from
the
tenth
report
of
the
new
york
zoölogical
pp
there
were
certain
trails
leading
over
the
hill
slopes
at
which
the
gorals
must
have
used
continually
judging
by
the
way
in
which
these
were
worn
we
also
found
much
sign
beneath
overhanging
rocks
and
on
projecting
ledges
to
indicate
that
these
were
definite
resorts
for
numbers
of
the
animals
many
which
we
saw
were
young
or
of
varying
ages
running
with
the
herds
and
it
was
interesting
to
see
how
perfectly
they
had
mastered
the
art
of
even
when
hardly
a
year
old
although
at
almost
all
were
on
the
east
side

the
wonderful

the
white
water
october
had
slipped
into
november
when
we
left
the
temple
and
shifted
camp
to
the
other
side
of
the
snow
mountain
at
the
white
water
it
was
a
brilliant
day
and
the
ride
up
the
valley
could
not
have
been
more
beautiful
crossing
the
or
dry
sea
a
great
grassy
plain
which
was
evidently
a
dry
lake
basin
we
followed
the
trail
into
the
forest
and
down
the
side
of
a
deep
cañon
to
a
mountain
stream
where
the
waters
spread
themselves
in
a
thin
green
veil
over
a
bed
of
white
stones
we
pitched
our
tents
on
a
broad
terrace
beside
the
stream
at
the
edge
of
the
spruce
forest
above
us
towered
the
highest
peak
of
the
mountain
with
a
glacier
nestling
in
a
basin
near
its
summit
and
the
slopes
extending
in
a
glorious
shining
crescent
about
our
camp
the
moon
was
full
and
each
night
as
we
sat
at
dinner
before
the
fire
the
ragged
peaks
turned
crimson
in
the
afterglow
of
the
sun
and
changed
to
purest
silver
at
the
touch
of
the
white
moonlight
we
have
had
many
camps
in
many
lands
but
none
more
beautiful
than
the
one
at
the
white
water
the
weather
was
perfect
every
day
the
sun
shone
in
a
cloudless
blue
sky
and
in
the
morning
the
ground
was
frozen
hard
and
covered
with
snowlike
frost
but
the
air
was
marvelously
stimulating
we
felt
that
we
could
be
happy
at
the
white
water
forever
but
it
did
not
prove
to
be
as
good
a
hunting
ground
as
that
on
the
other
side
of
the
mountain
the
lolos
killed
a
fine
serow
on
the
first
day
and
hotenfa
brought
in
a
young
goral
a
short
time
later
but
big
game
was
by
no
means
abundant
at
the
white
water
we
obtained
our
first
lady
amherst
pheasant
one
of
the
most
remarkable
species
of
a
family
containing
the
most
beautiful
birds
of
the
world
the
rainbow
colored
body
and
long
tail
of
the
male
are
made
more
conspicuous
by
a
broad
white
and
green
ruff
about
the
neck
the
first
birds
brought
alive
to
england
were
two
males
which
had
been
presented
to
the
countess
amherst
after
whom
the
species
was
named
we
found
this
pheasant
inhabiting
thick
forests
where
it
is
by
no
means
easy
to
discover
or
shoot
it
is
fairly
abundant
in
eastern
tibet
and
but
its
habits
are
not
well
known
although
the
camp
yielded
several
small
mammals
new
to
our
collection
we
decided
to
go
into
to
engage
a
new
caravan
for
our
trip
across
the
yangtze
river
while
heller
remained
in
camp
the
direct
road
to
was
considerably
shorter
than
by
way
of
the
snow
mountain
village
and
at
three
in
the
afternoon
our
beloved
temple
of
the
flowers
was
visible
on
the
hilltop
overlooking
the
city
as
we
rode
up
the
steep
ascent
we
saw
a
picturesque
gathering
on
the
porch
and
heard
the
sound
of
many
voices
laughing
and
talking
the
beautiful
courtyard
was
filled
with
women
and
children
of
every
age
and
description
and
all
the
doors
from
one
side
of
the
temple
had
been
removed
leaving
a
large
open
space
where
huge
cauldrons
were
boiling
and
steaming
we
sat
down
irresolutely
on
the
inner
porch
but
the
young
priest
was
delighted
to
see
us
and
insisted
that
we
wait
until
wu
arrived
we
were
glad
that
we
did
not
seek
other
quarters
for
we
were
to
witness
an
interesting
ceremony
which
is
most
characteristic
of
chinese
life
it
seemed
that
about
five
years
before
a
gentleman
of
had
shuffled
off
this
mortal
coil
his
soul
may
have
found
rest
but
his
mortal
coil
certainly
did
not
unfortunately
his
family
inherited
a
few
hundred
dollars
several
years
later
and
the
village
astrologer
informed
them
that
according
to
the
or
omnipotent
spirits
of
the
earth
wind
and
water
the
situation
of
the
deceased
gentleman
grave
was
and
that
if
they
ever
hoped
to
enjoy
good
fortune
again
they
must
dig
him
up
give
the
customary
feast
in
his
honor
and
have
another
burial
site
chosen
every
village
has
a
wise
man
who
is
always
called
upon
to
select
the
resting
place
of
the
dead
his
remuneration
varying
from
two
dollars
to
two
thousand
dollars
according
to
the
circumstances
of
the
relatives
the
astrologer
never
will
say
definitely
whether
or
not
the
spot
will
prove
a
propitious
one
and
if
the
family
later
sell
any
property
receive
a
legacy
or
are
known
to
have
obtained
money
in
other
ways
the
astrologer
usually
finds
that
the
do
not
favor
the
original
place
and
he
will
exact
another
fee
for
choosing
a
second
grave
the
dead
are
never
buried
until
the
astrologer
has
named
an
auspicious
day
as
well
as
an
appropriate
site
with
the
result
that
unburied
coffins
are
to
be
seen
in
temples
under
roadside
shelters
in
the
fields
and
in
the
back
yards
of
many
houses
any
interference
by
foreigners
with
this
custom
is
liable
to
bring
about
dire
results
as
in
the
case
of
the
rioting
in
shanghai
in
a
number
of
french
residents
objected
to
a
temple
near
by
being
used
to
store
a
score
or
more
of
bodies
until
a
convenient
time
for
burial
and
the
result
was
the
death
of
many
people
in
the
fighting
which
ensued
tyler
dennet
cites
an
amusing
anecdote
regarding
the
successful
handling
of
the
problem
by
a
native
mandarin
in
where
we
visited
caldwell
the
doctor
pointed
out
how
dangerous
to
public
health
was
the
presence
of
these
coffins
in
the
magistrate
had
a
census
taken
of
the
coffins
above
ground
in
the
city
and
found
that
they
actually
numbered
sixteen
thousand
the
city
itself
is
estimated
to
have
only
about
twenty
thousand
inhabitants
it
was
a
difficult
problem
for
the
magistrate
he
might
easily
move
in
such
a
way
as
to
bring
the
whole
city
down
about
his
head
but
the
chinese
are
clever
in
such
situations
perhaps
the
cleverest
people
on
earth
he
finally
devised
a
way
out
a
proclamation
was
issued
levying
a
tax
of
fifty
cents
on
every
unburied
coffin
the
chinese
may
be
superstitious
but
they
are
even
more
thrifty
for
a
few
weeks
devoted
itself
to
funerals
a
thousand
a
week
and
now
this
little
city
one
of
the
most
isolated
in
china
can
truly
be
said
to
be
on
the
road
to
health

the
white
water
there
are
very
few
such
progressive
cities
in
china
however
and
a
missionary
told
us
that
recently
a
young
child
and
his
grandfather
were
buried
on
the
same
day
although
their
deaths
had
been
nearly
fifty
years
apart
the
funeral
rites
are
in
themselves
fairly
simple
but
it
is
the
great
ambition
of
every
chinese
to
have
his
resting
place
as
near
as
possible
to
those
of
his
ancestors
that
is
one
of
the
reasons
why
they
are
so
loath
to
emigrate
we
often
passed
eight
or
ten
coolies
staggering
under
the
load
of
a
heavy
coffin
transporting
a
body
sometimes
a
month
journey
or
more
to
bury
it
at
the
dead
man
birthplace
a
rooster
usually
would
be
fastened
to
the
coffin
for
according
to
the
superstition
the
spirit
of
the
man
enters
the
bird
and
is
conveyed
by
it
to
his
home
there
is
a
strange
absence
of
the
fear
of
death
among
the
chinese
one
often
sees
large
planks
of
wood
stored
in
a
corner
of
a
house
and
one
is
told
that
these
are
destined
to
become
the
coffins
of
the
father
or
mother
even
though
his
parents
may
at
the
time
be
enjoying
the
most
robust
health
indeed
among
the
poorer
classes
a
coffin
is
considered
a
most
fitting
gift
for
a
son
to
present
to
his
father
we
established
our
camp
on
the
porch
of
the
temple
at
and
from
its
vantage
point
could
watch
the
festivities
going
on
about
us
the
feasting
continued
until
after
dark
and
at
daylight
the
kettles
were
again
steaming
to
prepare
for
the
second
day
celebration
by
ten
the
court
was
crowded
and
a
hour
later
there
came
a
partial
stillness
which
was
broken
by
a
sudden
burst
of
music
from
chinese
violins
and
pipes
going
outside
we
found
most
of
the
guests
standing
about
an
improvised
altar
the
foot
of
the
coffin
was
just
visible
in
the
midst
of
the
paper
decorations
and
in
front
of
it
were
set
half
a
dozen
dishes
of
tempting
food
these
were
meant
as
an
offering
to
the
spirit
of
the
departed
one
but
we
knew
this
would
not
prevent
the
sorrowing
relatives
from
eating
the
food
with
much
relish
later
on
in
a
few
moments
a
group
of
women
approached
supporting
a
figure
clothed
in
white
with
a
hood
drawn
over
her
face
she
was
bent
nearly
to
the
ground
and
muffled
shrieks
and
wails
came
from
the
depths
of
her
veil
as
she
prostrated
herself
in
front
of
the
altar
for
more
than
an
hour
this
chief
mourner
the
wife
of
the
deceased
lay
on
her
face
her
whole
figure
shaking
with
what
seemed
the
most
uncontrollable
anguish
this
same
lady
however
moved
about
later
among
her
guests
an
amiable
hostess
with
beaming
countenance
the
gayest
of
the
gay
but
every
morning
while
the
festivities
lasted
promptly
at
eleven
she
would
prostrate
herself
before
the
coffin
and
display
heartrending
grief
in
the
presence
of
the
unmoved
spectators
in
order
to
satisfy
the
demands
of
custom
custom
and
precedent
have
grown
to
be
divinities
with
the
chinese
and
such
a
display
of
feigned
emotion
is
required
on
certain
prescribed
occasions
as
one
missionary
aptly
described
it
the
chinese
are
all
face
and
no
heart
caldwell
told
us
that
one
night
while
passing
down
a
deserted
street
in
a
chinese
village
he
was
startled
to
hear
the
most
piercing
shrieks
issuing
from
a
house
nearby
thinking
someone
was
being
murdered
he
rushed
through
the
courtyard
only
to
find
that
a
girl
who
was
to
be
married
the
following
day
according
to
chinese
custom
was
displaying
the
most
desperate
anguish
at
the
prospect
of
leaving
her
family
even
though
she
probably
was
enchanted
with
the
idea
on
the
third
day
of
the
celebration
in
the
temple
at
the
feasting
ended
in
a
burst
of
splendor
from
one
until
far
past
sundown
the
friends
and
relatives
of
the
departed
one
were
fed
any
person
could
receive
an
invitation
by
bringing
a
small
present
even
if
it
were
only
a
bowl
of
rice
or
a
few
hundred
cash
ten
or
fifteen
cents
all
during
the
morning
girls
and
women
flocked
up
the
hill
with
trays
of
gifts
there
were
many
mosos
and
other
tribesmen
among
them
as
well
as
chinese
the
moso
girls
wore
their
black
hair
cut
short
on
the
sides
and
hanging
in
long
narrow
plaits
down
their
backs
they
wore
white
leather
capes
at
least
that
was
the
original
shade
and
pretty
ornaments
of
silver
and
coral
at
their
throats
and
as
they
were
young
and
gay
with
glowing
red
cheeks
and
laughing
eyes
they
were
decidedly
attractive
the
guests
were
seated
in
groups
of
six
on
the
stones
of
the
temple
courtyard
small
boys
acted
as
waiters
passing
about
steaming
bowls
of
vegetables
and
huge
straw
platters
heaped
high
with
rice
as
soon
as
each
guest
had
stuffed
himself
to
satisfaction
he
relinquished
his
place
to
someone
else
and
the
food
was
passed
again
we
were
frequently
pressed
to
eat
with
them
and
in
the
evening
when
the
last
guest
had
departed
the
chief
mourner
brought
us
some
delicious
fruit
candied
in
black
sugar
she
told
wu
that
they
had
fed
three
hundred
people
during
the
day
and
we
could
well
believe
it
the
next
morning
the
coffin
was
carried
down
the
hill
to
the
accompaniment
of
anguished
wails
and
we
were
left
once
more
to
the
peace
and
quiet
of
our
beautiful
temple
courtyard
sometimes
a
family
will
plunge
itself
into
debt
for
generations
to
come
to
provide
a
suitable
funeral
for
one
of
its
members
because
to
bury
the
dead
without
the
proper
display
would
not
only
be
to
lose
face
but
subject
them
to
the
possible
persecution
of
the
angered
spirits
this
is
only
one
of
the
pernicious
results
of
ancestor
worship
and
it
is
safe
to
say
that
most
of
the
evils
in
china
social
order
today
can
be
traced
directly
or
indirectly
to
this
unfortunate
practice
a
man
chief
concern
is
to
leave
male
descendants
to
worship
at
his
grave
and
appease
his
spirit
the
more
sons
grandsons
and
who
walk
in
his
funeral
procession
the
more
he
is
to
be
envied
as
a
missionary
humorously
says
the
only
law
of
god
that
ever
has
been
obeyed
in
china
is
to
be
fruitful
and
multiply
craving
for
progeny
has
brought
into
existence
thousands
upon
thousands
of
human
beings
who
exist
on
the
very
brink
of
starvation
nowhere
in
the
civilized
world
is
there
a
more
sordid
and
desperate
struggle
to
maintain
life
or
a
more
hopeless
poverty
but
fear
and
oblige
them
to
continue
their
blind
breeding
the
apparent
atrophy
of
the
entire
race
is
due
to
ancestor
worship
which
binds
it
with
chains
of
iron
to
its
dead
and
to
its
past
and
not
until
these
bonds
are
severed
can
china
expect
to
take
her
place
among
the
progressive
nations

chapter

across
the
yangtze
gorge
in
we
left
the
white
water
with
a
caravan
of
mules
and
horses
following
the
road
from
to
the
yangtze
we
crossed
the
black
water
and
climbed
steadily
upward
over
several
tremendous
wooded
ridges
each
higher
than
the
last
to
the
summit
of
the
divide
the
descent
was
gradual
through
a
magnificent
pine
and
spruce
forest
some
of
the
trees
were
at
least
one
hundred
and
fifty
feet
high
and
were
draped
with
beautiful
gray
moss
which
had
looped
itself
from
branch
to
branch
and
hung
suspended
in
delicate
streamers
yards
in
length
the
forest
was
choked
with
underbrush
and
a
dense
growth
of
dwarf
bamboo
and
the
hundreds
of
fallen
logs
carpeted
with
bronze
moss
made
ideal
conditions
for
small
mammal
collecting
however
as
all
the
species
would
probably
be
similar
to
those
we
had
obtained
on
the
snow
mountain
we
did
not
feel
that
it
was
worth
while
stopping
to
trap
at
in
the
afternoon
we
camped
upon
a
beautiful
hill
in
a
pine
forest
which
was
absolutely
devoid
of
underbrush
and
where
the
floor
was
thinly
overlaid
with
brown
pine
needles
although
the
moso
hunter
who
acted
as
our
guide
assured
us
that
the
river
was
only
three
miles
away
it
proved
to
be
more
than
fifteen
and
we
did
not
reach
the
ferry
until
half
past
one
the
next
afternoon
we
were
continually
annoyed
as
every
traveler
in
china
is
by
the
inaccuracy
of
the
natives
and
especially
of
the
chinese
their
ideas
of
distance
are
most
extraordinary
one
may
ask
a
chinaman
how
far
it
is
to
a
certain
village
and
he
will
blandly
reply
fifteen
to
go
but
thirty
when
you
come
back
after
a
short
experience
one
learns
how
to
interpret
such
an
answer
for
it
means
that
when
going
the
road
is
down
hill
and
that
the
return
uphill
will
require
double
the
time
caravans
are
supposed
to
travel
ten
an
hour
although
they
seldom
do
more
than
eight
and
all
calculations
of
distance
are
based
upon
time
so
far
as
the
are
concerned
if
the
day
march
is
eight
hours
you
invariably
will
be
informed
that
the
distance
is
eighty
although
in
reality
it
may
not
be
half
as
great
in
chinese
characteristics
arthur
smith
gives
many
illuminating
observations
on
the
inaccuracy
of
the
chinese
in
regard
to
distance
he
says
it
is
always
necessary
in
land
travel
to
ascertain
when
the
distance
is
given
in
miles
whether
the
miles
are
large
or
not
that
there
is
some
basis
for
estimates
of
distances
we
do
not
deny
but
what
we
do
deny
is
that
these
estimates
or
measurements
are
either
accurate
or
uniform
it
is
so
far
as
we
know
a
universal
experience
that
the
moment
one
leaves
a
great
imperial
highway
the
miles
become
long
if
constitute
a
fair
day
journey
on
the
main
road
then
on
country
roads
it
will
take
fully
as
long
to
go
and
in
the
mountains
the
whole
day
will
be
spent
in
getting
over
in
like
manner
a
farmer
who
is
asked
the
weight
of
one
of
his
oxen
gives
a
figure
which
seems
much
too
low
until
he
explains
that
he
has
omitted
to
estimate
the
bones
a
servant
who
was
asked
his
height
mentioned
a
measure
which
was
ridiculously
inadequate
to
cover
his
length
and
upon
being
questioned
admitted
that
he
had
left
out
of
account
all
above
his
shoulders
he
had
once
been
a
soldier
where
the
heft
of
the
men
clavicle
is
important
in
assigning
the
carrying
of
burdens
and
since
a
chinese
soldier
is
to
all
practical
purposes
complete
without
his
head
this
was
omitted
of
a
different
sort
was
the
measurement
of
a
rustic
who
affirmed
that
he
lived
ninety
from
the
city
but
upon
he
consented
to
an
abatement
as
this
was
reckoning
both
to
the
city
and
back
the
real
distance
being
as
he
admitted
only
one
way
the
habit
of
reckoning
by
tens
is
and
leads
to
much
vagueness
a
few
people
are
ten
or
twenty
a
few
tens
or
perhaps
ever
so
many
tens
and
a
strictly
accurate
enumeration
is
one
of
the
rarest
of
experiences
in
china
an
acquaintance
told
the
writer
that
two
men
had
spent
strings
of
cash
on
a
theatrical
exhibition
adding
a
moment
later
it
was
strings
but
that
is
the
same
as
is
it
not
a
man
who
wished
advice
in
a
lawsuit
told
the
writer
that
he
himself
lived
in
a
particular
village
though
it
was
obvious
from
his
narrative
that
his
abode
was
in
the
suburbs
of
a
city
upon
inquiry
he
admitted
that
he
did
not
live
in
the
village
and
further
investigation
revealed
the
fact
that
the
removal
took
place
nineteen
generations
ago
but
do
you
not
almost
consider
yourself
a
resident
of
the
city
now
he
was
asked
yes
he
replied
simply
we
do
live
there
now
but
the
old
root
is
in
that
village
the
whole
chinese
system
of
thinking
is
based
on
a
line
of
assumptions
different
from
those
to
which
we
are
accustomed
and
they
can
ill
comprehend
the
mania
which
seems
to
possess
the
occidental
to
ascertain
everything
with
unerring
exactness
the
chinese
does
not
know
how
many
families
there
are
in
his
native
village
and
he
does
not
wish
to
know
what
any
human
being
can
want
to
know
this
number
for
is
to
him
an
insoluble
riddle
it
is
a
few
hundred
several
hundreds
or
not
a
few
but
a
fixed
and
definite
number
it
never
was
and
never
will
be
p
after
breaking
camp
on
the
day
following
our
departure
from
the
white
water
we
rode
along
a
broad
trail
through
a
beautiful
pine
forest
and
in
the
late
morning
stood
on
an
open
summit
gazing
on
one
of
the
most
impressive
sights
which
china
has
to
offer
at
the
left
and
a
thousand
feet
below
the
mighty
yangtze
has
broken
through
the
mountains
in
a
gorge
almost
a
mile
deep
a
gorge
which
seems
to
have
been
carved
out
of
the
solid
rock
sharp
and
clean
with
a
giant
knife
a
few
miles
to
the
right
the
mountains
widen
leaving
a
flat
plain
two
hundred
feet
above
the
river
every
inch
of
it
as
well
as
the
valleys
which
stretch
upward
between
the
hills
is
under
cultivation
giving
support
for
three
villages
the
largest
of
which
is
taku
the
ferry
is
in
a
bad
place
but
it
is
the
only
spot
for
miles
where
the
river
can
be
crossed
the
south
bank
is
so
precipitous
that
the
trail
from
the
plain
twists
and
turns
like
a
snake
before
it
emerges
upon
a
narrow
sand
and
gravel
beach
the
opposite
side
of
the
river
is
a
vertical
wall
of
rock
which
slopes
back
a
little
at
the
lower
end
to
form
a
steep
hillside
covered
with
short
grass
the
landing
place
is
a
mass
of
jagged
rocks
fronting
a
small
patch
of
still
water
and
the
trail
up
the
face
of
the
cliff
is
so
steep
that
it
can
not
be
climbed
by
any
loaded
animal
therefore
all
the
packs
must
be
unstrapped
and
laboriously
carted
up
the
slope
on
the
backs
of
the
at
in
the
afternoon
we
were
loading
the
boat
which
carried
only
two
animals
and
their
packs
for
the
first
trip
across
the
river
it
was
difficult
to
get
the
mules
aboard
for
they
had
to
be
whipped
shoved
and
actually
lifted
bodily
into
the
dory
one
of
the
ferrymen
first
drew
the
craft
along
the
rocks
by
a
long
rope
then
climbed
up
the
face
of
what
appeared
to
be
an
absolutely
flat
wall
and
after
pulling
the
boat
close
beneath
him
slid
down
into
it
in
this
way
the
dory
was
worked
well
up
stream
and
when
pushed
into
the
swift
current
was
rowed
diagonally
to
the
other
side
after
four
loads
had
been
taken
over
the
boatmen
decided
to
stop
work
although
there
was
yet
more
than
an
hour
of
daylight
and
they
could
not
be
persuaded
to
cross
again
by
either
threats
or
coaxing
it
was
an
uncomfortable
situation
but
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
camp
where
we
were
even
though
the
greater
part
of
our
baggage
was
on
the
other
side
with
only
the
to
guard
it
and
therefore
open
to
robbery
about
a
third
of
a
mile
from
the
ferry
we
found
a
sandy
cornfield
on
a
level
shelf
just
above
the
water
and
pitched
our
tents
a
slight
wind
was
blowing
and
before
long
we
had
sand
in
our
shoes
sand
in
our
beds
sand
in
our
clothes
and
we
were
eating
sand
heller
went
down
the
river
with
a
bag
of
traps
while
we
set
forty
on
the
hills
above
camp
and
after
a
supper
of
goral
steak
which
did
much
to
allay
the
irritation
of
the
day
we
crawled
into
our
sandy
beds
at
daylight
hotenfa
visited
the
ferry
and
reported
that
the
loads
were
safe
but
that
one
of
the
boatmen
had
gone
to
the
village
and
no
one
knew
when
he
would
return
we
went
to
the
river
with
wu
as
soon
as
breakfast
was
over
and
spent
an
aggravating
hour
trying
by
alternate
threats
and
cajoling
to
persuade
the
remaining
ferryman
to
cross
the
river
to
us
but
it
was
useless
for
the
louder
i
swore
the
more
frightened
he
became
and
he
finally
retired
into
a
rock
cave
from
which
the
had
to
drag
him
out
bodily
and
drive
him
into
the
boat
the
second
boatman
ambled
slowly
in
about
ten
and
we
felt
like
beating
them
both
but
wu
impressed
upon
us
the
necessity
for
patience
if
we
ever
expected
to
get
our
caravan
across
and
we
swallowed
our
wrath
nevertheless
we
decided
not
to
leave
until
the
loads
and
mules
were
on
the
other
side
and
we
ate
a
cold
tiffin
while
sitting
on
the
sand
heller
employed
his
time
by
skinning
the
twenty
small
mammals
one
of
which
was
a
new
rat
that
our
traps
had
yielded
we
took
a
good
many
photographs
and
several
rolls
of
movie
film
showing
the
efforts
of
the
to
get
the
mules
aboard
some
of
them
went
in
quietly
enough
but
others
absolutely
refused
to
step
into
the
boat
one
of
the
would
pull
another
push
a
third
twist
the
animal
tail
and
a
fourth
lift
its
feet
singly
over
the
side
with
the
accompaniment
of
yells
kicks
and
chinese
oaths
the
performance
was
picturesque
to
say
the
least
illustration
a
liso
hunter
carrying
a
flying
squirrel
illustration
the
chief
of
our
lolo
hunters
by
five
the
entire
caravan
had
been
taken
across
the
racing
green
water
and
we
had
some
time
before
dark
in
which
to
investigate
the
caverns
with
which
the
cliffs
above
the
river
are
honeycombed
they
were
of
two
kinds
gold
quarries
and
dwelling
caves
the
latter
consist
of
a
long
central
shaft
just
high
enough
to
allow
a
man
to
stand
erect
this
widens
into
a
circular
room
along
the
sides
of
the
corridor
shallow
nests
have
been
scooped
out
to
serve
as
beds
and
all
the
cooking
is
done
not
far
from
the
door
the
caves
although
almost
dark
make
fairly
comfortable
living
quarters
and
are
by
no
means
as
dirty
or
as
evil
smelling
as
the
ordinary
native
house
the
mines
are
straight
shafts
dug
into
the
cliffs
where
the
rock
is
quarried
and
crushed

chapter
xx
through
unmapped
country
we
left
the
taku
ferry
by
way
of
a
steep
trail
through
an
open
pine
and
spruce
forest
along
the
rim
of
the
yangtze
gorge
where
the
view
was
magnificent
someone
has
said
that
when
a
tourist
sees
the
grand
cañon
for
the
first
time
he
gasps
indescribable
and
then
immediately
begins
to
describe
it
thus
it
was
with
us
but
no
words
can
picture
the
grandeur
of
this
titanic
chasm
in
places
the
rocks
were
painted
in
delicate
tints
of
blue
and
purple
in
others
the
sides
fell
away
in
sheer
drops
of
hundreds
of
feet
to
the
green
torrent
below
rushing
on
to
the
sea
two
thousand
five
hundred
miles
away
the
caravan
wound
along
the
edge
of
the
gorge
all
day
and
we
were
left
far
behind
for
at
each
turn
a
view
more
beautiful
than
the
last
opened
out
before
us
and
until
every
color
plate
and
negative
in
the
holders
had
been
exposed
we
worked
steadily
with
the
camera
we
were
traveling
northwestward
through
an
unmapped
region
which
baron
had
skirted
and
reported
to
be
one
of
vast
forests
and
probably
rich
in
game
after
six
hours
of
riding
over
almost
bare
we
passed
through
a
parklike
spruce
forest
and
reached
habala
a
long
thin
village
of
mud
and
stone
houses
scattered
up
the
sides
of
a
narrow
valley
above
and
to
the
left
of
the
village
rose
ridge
after
ridge
of
dense
spruce
forest
overshadowed
by
a
peak
and
cut
by
deep
ravines
the
gloomy
depths
of
which
yielded
fascinating
glimpses
of
rocky
cliffs
a
veritable
paradise
for
serow
and
goral
our
camping
place
was
a
grassy
lawn
as
flat
and
smooth
as
the
putting
green
of
a
golf
course
just
below
the
tents
a
streamlet
of
water
murmured
comfortably
to
itself
and
a
huge
dead
tree
was
lying
crushed
and
broken
for
the
camp
fire
the
boys
turned
the
beautiful
spot
into
home
in
half
an
hour
and
after
setting
a
line
of
traps
we
wandered
slowly
back
through
the
darkness
guided
by
the
brilliant
flames
of
the
fires
which
threw
a
warm
yellow
glow
over
our
little
table
spread
for
dinner
we
sent
men
to
the
village
to
bring
in
hunters
and
after
dinner
four
or
five
picturesque
mosos
appeared
they
said
that
there
were
many
serow
goral
muntjac
and
some
wapiti
in
the
forests
above
the
village
and
we
could
well
believe
it
for
there
was
never
a
more
likely
looking
spot
although
the
men
did
not
claim
to
be
professional
hunters
nevertheless
they
said
that
they
had
good
dogs
and
had
killed
many
muntjac
and
other
animals
they
agreed
to
come
at
daylight
and
arrived
about
two
hours
late
which
was
doing
fairly
well
for
natives
it
was
a
brilliant
day
just
warm
enough
for
comfort
in
the
sun
and
we
left
camp
with
high
hopes
however
it
did
not
take
many
hours
to
demonstrate
that
the
men
knew
almost
nothing
about
hunting
and
that
their
dogs
were
useless
because
of
the
dense
cover
still
hunting
was
out
of
the
question
and
after
a
hard
climb
we
returned
to
camp
to
spend
the
remainder
of
the
afternoon
developing
photographs
and
preparing
small
mammals
our
traps
had
yielded
three
new
shrews
and
a
silver
mole
as
well
as
a
number
of
mice
rats
and
meadow
voles
of
species
identical
with
those
taken
on
the
snow
mountain
it
was
evident
therefore
that
the
yangtze
river
does
not
act
as
an
effective
barrier
to
the
distribution
of
even
the
smallest
forms
and
that
the
region
in
which
we
were
now
working
would
not
produce
a
different
fauna
this
was
an
important
discovery
from
the
standpoint
of
our
distribution
records
but
was
also
somewhat
disappointing
the
photographic
work
already
had
yielded
excellent
results
the
paget
color
plates
were
especially
beautiful
and
the
fact
that
everything
was
developed
in
the
field
gave
us
an
opportunity
to
check
the
quality
of
each
negative
for
this
work
the
portable
dark
room
was
invaluable
it
could
be
quickly
erected
and
suspended
from
a
tree
branch
or
the
rafters
of
a
temple
and
offered
an
absolutely
safe
place
in
which
to
develop
or
load
plates
the
film
required
special
treatment
because
of
its
size
and
we
usually
fastened
in
the
servants
tent
the
red
lining
which
had
been
made
for
this
purpose
in
new
york
even
then
the
space
was
so
cramped
that
we
were
dead
tired
at
the
end
of
a
few
hours
work
one
who
sits
comfortably
in
a
theater
or
hall
and
sees
film
which
has
been
obtained
in
such
remote
parts
of
the
world
does
not
realize
the
difficulties
in
its
preparation
the
water
for
developing
almost
invariably
was
dirty
and
in
order
to
insure
even
a
moderately
clear
film
it
always
had
to
be
strained
for
washing
the
negative
pailful
after
pailful
had
to
be
carried
sometimes
from
a
very
long
distance
and
the
film
exposed
for
hours
to
the
carelessness
or
curiosity
of
the
natives
in
our
cramped
quarters
perhaps
a
corner
of
the
tent
would
be
pushed
open
admitting
a
stream
of
light
the
electric
flash
lamp
might
refuse
to
work
leaving
us
in
complete
darkness
to
finish
the
developing
by
guess
and
by
gosh
or
any
number
of
other
accidents
occur
to
ruin
the
film
at
most
we
could
not
develop
more
than
three
hundred
feet
in
an
afternoon
and
we
never
breathed
freely
until
it
finally
was
dried
and
safely
stored
away
in
the
tin
cans
we
left
habala
on
november
for
a
village
called
phete
where
the
natives
had
assured
us
we
would
find
good
hunters
with
dogs
for
almost
the
entire
distance
the
road
skirted
the
rim
of
the
yangtze
gorge
and
there
the
view
of
the
great
chasm
was
even
more
magnificent
than
that
we
had
left
while
its
sides
are
not
fantastically
sculptured
and
the
colors
are
softer
than
those
of
the
grand
cañon
of
the
colorado
nevertheless
its
grandeur
is
hardly
less
imposing
and
if
is
ever
made
accessible
by
railroads
this
gorge
should
become
a
mecca
for
tourists
for
it
is
without
doubt
one
of
the
most
remarkable
natural
sights
in
the
world
about
two
in
the
afternoon
we
saw
three
clusters
of
houses
on
a
tableland
which
juts
into
a
chasm
cut
by
a
tributary
of
the
great
river
one
of
them
was
phete
and
it
seemed
that
we
would
reach
the
village
in
half
an
hour
at
least
but
the
road
wound
so
tortuously
around
the
hillside
down
to
the
stream
and
up
again
that
it
was
an
hour
and
a
half
before
we
found
a
camping
place
on
a
narrow
terrace
a
short
distance
from
the
nearest
houses
next
day
we
could
not
go
to
the
village
to
find
hunters
until
because
the
natives
of
this
region
are
very
late
risers
and
often
have
not
yet
opened
their
doors
at
ten
this
is
quite
contrary
to
the
custom
in
many
other
parts
of
china
where
the
inhabitants
are
about
their
work
in
the
first
light
of
dawn
the
hills
above
phete
are
bare
or
thinly
forested
and
every
available
inch
of
level
ground
is
under
cultivation
with
corn
and
a
few
rice
paddys
near
the
creek
the
latter
were
a
great
surprise
for
we
had
not
expected
to
find
rice
so
far
north
the
village
itself
was
exceedingly
picturesque
but
never
have
we
met
people
of
such
utter
and
hopeless
stupidity
as
its
inhabitants
they
were
pleasant
enough
and
always
greeted
us
with
a
smile
and
salutation
but
their
brains
seemed
not
to
have
kept
pace
with
their
bodies
and
when
asked
the
simplest
question
they
would
only
stare
stupidly
without
the
slightest
glimmering
of
intelligence
it
required
an
hour
questioning
of
a
dozen
or
more
people
to
glean
that
there
were
no
hunters
in
the
village
where
they
had
lived
all
their
lives
but
wu
our
interpreter
finally
discovered
a
chinese
who
told
us
of
a
hunter
in
the
mountains
he
asked
how
far
and
the
answer
was
not
very
far
well
is
it
ten
i
do
know
how
many
have
you
ever
been
there
yes
it
is
only
a
few
steps
how
long
will
it
take
to
get
there
about
the
time
of
one
meal
we
were
not
to
be
deceived
for
we
had
had
experience
with
native
ideas
of
distance
and
we
ate
our
tiffin
before
starting
out
on
the
few
steps
a
steep
trail
led
up
the
valley
and
after
three
hours
of
steady
riding
we
reached
the
hunter
village
of
three
large
houses
on
a
flat
strip
of
cleared
ground
in
the
midst
of
a
dense
forest
the
people
looked
much
like
those
of
phete
but
were
rather
anemic
specimens
and
five
out
of
eight
had
enormous
goiters
they
were
exceedingly
shy
at
first
watching
us
with
side
glances
and
through
cracks
in
the
wall
wu
learned
that
we
were
the
first
white
persons
they
had
ever
seen
i
imagine
that
much
of
their
unhealthiness
was
due
to
too
close
intermarriage
for
these
families
had
little
intercourse
with
the
people
in
phete
who
were
only
a
few
steps
away
as
we
were
leaving
they
began
to
eat
their
supper
in
the
courtyard
the
principal
dish
consisted
of
mixed
cornmeal
and
rice
boiled
squash
and
green
vegetables
all
the
women
were
busy
husking
corn
which
was
hung
to
dry
on
great
racks
about
the
house
these
racks
we
had
noticed
in
every
village
since
leaving
and
they
seemed
to
be
in
universal
use
in
the
north
the
hunter
had
a
flock
of
sheep
and
we
purchased
one
for
mexican
but
there
was
considerable
difficulty
in
paying
for
it
since
these
people
had
never
seen
chinese
money
even
though
living
in
china
itself
for
currency
they
used
chunks
of
silver
the
size
of
a
walnut
and
worth
about
one
dollar
mexican
the
chinese
guide
finally
persuaded
the
people
of
the
genuineness
of
our
money
and
we
purchased
a
few
eggs
and
a
little
very
delicious
wild
honey
besides
the
sheep
these
people
as
well
as
those
of
phete
spoke
the
dialect
but
with
such
variation
that
even
our
could
understand
them
only
with
the
greatest
difficulty
when
we
returned
to
camp
we
found
that
the
coolie
who
had
been
engaged
to
carry
the
camera
and
tripod
had
left
without
the
formality
of
saying
or
asking
for
the
money
which
was
due
him
we
had
had
considerable
trouble
with
the
camera
coolies
since
leaving
the
first
one
carried
the
camera
to
the
taku
ferry
with
many
groans
and
there
engaged
a
huge
chinaman
to
take
his
place
for
he
thought
the
load
too
heavy
it
only
weighed
fifty
pounds
and
in
the
fukien
province
where
men
seldom
carry
less
than
eighty
pounds
and
sometimes
as
much
as
one
hundred
and
fifty
it
would
have
been
considered
as
only
half
a
burden
in
however
animals
do
most
of
the
pack
carrying
and
coolies
protest
at
even
an
ordinary
load
we
left
phete
in
the
early
morning
and
camped
about
five
hundred
feet
above
the
hunter
cabin
in
a
beautiful
little
meadow
it
was
surrounded
with
splendid
pine
trees
and
a
clear
spring
bubbled
up
from
a
knoll
in
the
center
and
spread
in
a
dozen
little
streams
over
the
edge
of
a
deep
ravine
where
a
mountain
torrent
rushed
through
a
tangled
bamboo
jungle
the
gigantic
fallen
trees
were
covered
inches
deep
with
green
moss
and
altogether
it
was
an
ideal
spot
for
small
mammals
our
traps
however
yielded
no
new
species
although
we
secured
dozens
of
specimens
every
night
there
were
a
few
families
of
lolos
about
two
miles
away
and
these
were
engaged
as
hunters
they
told
us
that
serow
and
muntjac
were
abundant
and
that
wapiti
were
sometimes
found
on
the
mountains
several
miles
to
the
northward
although
the
men
had
a
large
pack
of
good
dogs
they
were
such
unsatisfactory
hunters
that
we
gave
up
in
disgust
after
three
days
they
never
would
appear
until
ten
or
eleven
in
the
morning
when
the
sun
had
so
dried
the
leaves
that
the
scent
was
lost
and
the
dogs
could
not
follow
a
trail
even
if
one
were
found
moreover
the
camp
was
a
very
uncomfortable
one
due
to
the
wind
which
roared
through
the
trees
night
and
day
we
were
rejoined
here
by
hotenfa
who
had
left
us
at
the
taku
ferry
to
see
if
he
could
get
together
a
pack
of
dogs
he
brought
three
hounds
with
him
which
he
praised
exuberantly
but
we
subsequently
found
that
they
did
not
justify
our
hopes
nevertheless
we
were
glad
to
have
hotenfa
back
for
he
was
one
of
the
most
intelligent
faithful
and
altogether
charming
natives
whom
we
met
in
all
he
was
an
uncouth
savage
when
he
first
came
to
us
but
in
a
very
short
time
he
had
learned
our
camp
ways
and
was
as
good
a
servant
as
any
we
had
chapter
xxi
traveling
toward
tibet
since
the
hunters
at
the
windy
camp
had
proved
so
worthless
and
the
traps
had
yielded
no
small
mammals
new
to
our
collection
we
decided
to
cross
the
mountains
toward
the
road
which
leads
into
tibet
the
head
explored
the
trail
and
reported
that
it
was
impassable
but
after
an
examination
of
some
of
the
worst
barriers
we
decided
that
they
could
be
cleared
away
and
ordered
the
caravan
to
start
at
half
past
seven
in
the
morning
before
long
we
found
that
the
were
right
the
trail
was
a
mass
of
tangled
underbrush
and
fallen
logs
and
led
straight
up
a
precipitous
mountain
through
a
veritable
jungle
of
dwarf
bamboo
it
was
necessary
to
stop
every
few
yards
to
lift
the
loads
over
a
barrier
or
cut
a
passage
through
the
bamboo
thickets
and
had
it
not
been
for
the
adjustable
pack
saddles
we
never
could
have
taken
the
caravan
over
the
trail
late
in
the
afternoon
the
exhausted
men
and
animals
dragged
themselves
to
the
summit
of
the
mountain
for
it
was
not
a
pass
in
a
few
hours
we
had
come
from
autumn
to
where
the
ground
was
frozen
and
covered
with
snow
we
were
at
an
altitude
of
more
than
feet
and
far
above
all
timber
except
the
rhododendron
forest
which
spread
itself
out
in
a
low
gray
mass
along
the
ridges
it
was
difficult
to
make
the
slightest
exertion
in
the
thin
air
and
a
bitterly
cold
wind
swept
across
the
peaks
so
that
it
was
impossible
to
keep
warm
even
when
wrapped
in
our
heaviest
coats
the
servants
and
suffered
considerably
but
it
was
too
late
to
go
on
and
there
was
no
alternative
but
to
spend
the
night
on
the
mountain
as
soon
as
the
tents
were
up
the
men
huddled
disconsolately
about
the
fire
but
we
started
out
with
a
bag
of
traps
while
heller
went
in
the
opposite
direction
we
expected
to
catch
some
new
mammals
during
the
night
for
there
were
great
numbers
of
runways
on
the
bare
hillsides
the
ground
was
frozen
so
solidly
that
it
was
necessary
to
cut
into
the
little
tunnels
with
a
hatchet
in
order
to
set
the
traps
and
we
were
almost
frozen
before
the
work
was
completed
the
next
morning
we
had
caught
twenty
specimens
of
a
new
meadow
vole
and
a
remarkable
shrew
with
a
long
curved
proboscis
everyone
had
spent
an
uncomfortable
night
for
it
was
bitterly
cold
even
in
our
sleeping
bags
and
the
men
had
sat
up
about
the
fire
in
order
to
keep
from
freezing
there
was
little
difficulty
in
getting
the
caravan
started
in
the
gray
light
of
early
dawn
and
after
descending
abruptly
four
thousand
feet
on
a
precipitous
trail
to
a
lolo
village
strung
out
along
a
beautiful
little
valley
we
were
again
in
the
pleasant
warmth
of
late
autumn
the
natives
here
had
never
before
seen
a
white
person
and
in
a
few
moments
our
tents
were
surrounded
by
a
crowd
of
men
and
boys
the
chief
of
the
village
presented
us
with
an
enormous
rooster
and
we
made
him
happy
by
returning
two
tins
of
cigarettes
the
lolo
women
the
first
we
had
seen
were
especially
surprising
because
of
their
graceful
figures
and
handsome
faces
their
flat
turbans
short
jackets
and
long
skirts
with
huge
flounces
gave
them
a
rather
aspect
quite
out
of
harmony
with
the
metal
earrings
and
bracelets
which
they
all
wore
the
men
were
exceedingly
pleasant
and
made
a
picturesque
group
in
their
gray
and
brown
felt
capes
which
they
gather
about
the
neck
by
a
draw
string
and
to
the
lolos
and
mosos
alike
are
both
bed
and
clothing
we
collected
all
the
men
for
their
photographs
and
although
they
had
not
the
slightest
idea
what
we
were
about
they
stood
quietly
after
hotenfa
had
assured
them
that
the
instrument
would
not
go
off
but
most
interesting
of
all
was
their
astonishment
when
half
an
hour
later
they
saw
the
negative
and
were
able
to
identify
themselves
upon
it
the
lolos
are
apparently
a
much
maligned
race
they
are
exceedingly
independent
and
although
along
the
frontier
of
their
own
territory
in
they
wage
a
war
of
robbery
and
destruction
it
is
not
wholly
unprovoked
no
one
can
enter
their
country
safely
unless
he
is
under
the
protection
of
a
chief
who
acts
as
a
sponsor
and
passes
him
along
to
others
brooke
an
englishman
was
killed
by
the
lolos
but
he
was
not
properly
chaperoned
and
major
of
the
french
expedition
lived
among
them
safely
for
some
time
and
gives
them
unstinted
praise
whenever
we
met
tribesmen
in
who
had
not
seen
white
persons
they
behaved
much
like
all
other
natives
they
were
of
course
always
greatly
astonished
to
see
our
caravan
descend
upon
them
and
were
invariably
fascinated
by
our
guns
tents
and
in
fact
everything
about
us
but
were
generally
shy
and
decidedly
less
offensive
in
their
curiosity
than
the
chinese
of
the
larger
inland
towns
to
whom
foreigners
are
by
no
means
unknown
as
a
matter
of
fact
we
have
found
that
our
white
skins
light
eyes
and
hair
are
a
never
failing
source
of
interest
and
envy
to
almost
all
orientals
illustration
lolos
seeing
their
photographs
for
the
first
time
yvette
usually
excited
the
most
curiosity
especially
among
the
women
and
as
she
wore
knickerbockers
and
a
flannel
shirt
there
were
times
when
the
determination
of
her
sex
seemed
to
call
forth
the
liveliest
discussion
her
long
hair
however
usually
settled
the
matter
and
then
the
women
had
decided
the
question
of
gender
satisfactorily
they
often
made
timid
and
most
amusing
advances
one
woman
said
she
greatly
admired
her
fair
complexion
and
asked
how
many
baths
she
took
to
keep
her
skin
so
white
another
wondered
whether
it
was
necessary
to
ever
comb
her
hair
and
almost
everyone
wished
to
feel
her
clothes
and
shoes
she
always
would
command
more
attention
than
anyone
else
by
her
camera
operations
and
a
group
would
stand
in
speechless
amazement
to
see
her
dodge
in
and
out
of
the
portable
dark
room
when
she
was
developing
photographs
or
loading
plates
we
made
arrangements
to
go
with
a
number
of
the
lolos
to
a
spot
fifteen
miles
away
on
the
road
to
hunt
wapiti
probably
which
the
natives
call
our
american
wapiti
or
elk
is
a
migrant
from
asia
by
way
of
the
bering
strait
and
is
probably
a
relative
of
the
wapiti
which
is
found
in
central
asia
china
manchuria
and
korea
at
present
these
deer
are
abundant
in
but
few
places
throughout
the
orient
and
especially
in
china
the
growing
horns
when
they
are
soft
or
in
the
velvet
are
considered
of
great
medicinal
value
and
during
the
summer
the
animals
are
trapped
and
hunted
relentlessly
by
the
natives
in
when
we
were
there
a
pair
of
horns
were
worth
mexican
thanksgiving
morning
dawned
gray
and
raw
with
occasional
flurries
of
haillike
snow
but
we
did
not
heed
the
cold
for
the
trail
led
over
two
high
ridges
and
along
the
rim
of
a
tremendous
gorge
to
the
south
the
white
summits
of
the
snow
mountain
range
towered
majestically
above
the
surrounding
peaks
and
in
the
gray
light
the
colors
were
beautiful
beyond
description
to
the
north
we
could
see
heavily
wooded
mountain
slopes
interspersed
with
open
parklike
meadows
splendid
wapiti
country
our
tents
were
pitched
two
hundred
yards
from
the
road
just
within
the
edge
of
a
stately
forest
that
night
we
celebrated
with
harmless
bombs
from
the
huge
fires
of
bamboo
stalks
which
exploded
as
they
filled
with
steam
and
echoed
among
the
trees
like
pistol
shots
marco
polo
speaks
of
the
same
phenomenon
which
he
first
witnessed
in
this
region
over
six
hundred
and
thirty
years
ago
about
nine
in
the
evening
we
ran
our
traps
with
a
lantern
and
besides
several
mice
found
two
rare
shrews
and
a
new
mole
i
went
out
with
the
hunters
at
dawn
but
saw
nothing
except
an
old
wapiti
track
and
a
little
sign
all
during
the
following
day
a
dense
fog
hung
close
to
the
ground
so
that
it
was
impossible
to
hunt
and
on
the
night
of
december
it
snowed
heavily
the
morning
began
bright
and
clear
but
clouded
about
ten
and
became
so
bitterly
cold
that
the
lolos
would
not
hunt
they
really
suffered
considerably
and
that
night
they
all
left
us
to
return
to
their
homes
we
were
greatly
disappointed
for
we
had
brilliant
prospects
of
good
wapiti
shooting
but
without
either
men
or
dogs
and
in
an
unknown
country
there
was
little
possibility
of
successful
still
hunting
the
were
very
much
worried
and
refused
to
go
further
north
they
were
certain
that
we
would
not
be
able
to
cross
the
high
passes
which
lay
between
us
and
the
mekong
valley
far
to
the
westward
and
complained
unceasingly
about
the
freezing
cold
and
the
lack
of
food
for
their
animals
it
was
necessary
to
visit
the
mekong
river
for
even
though
it
might
not
be
a
good
big
game
region
it
would
give
us
a
as
it
were
of
the
fauna
and
important
data
on
the
distribution
of
small
mammals
therefore
we
decided
to
leave
for
the
long
ride
as
soon
as
the
weather
permitted
chapter

stalking
tibetans
with
a
camera
the
road
near
which
we
were
camped
was
one
of
the
great
trade
routes
into
tibet
and
over
it
caravans
were
continually
passing
laden
with
tea
or
pork
many
of
them
had
traveled
the
entire
length
of
to
on
the
tonking
frontier
where
a
special
kind
of
tea
is
grown
and
were
hurrying
northward
to
cross
the
passes
which
form
the
gateways
to
the
forbidden
land
the
caravans
sometimes
stopped
for
luncheon
or
to
spend
the
night
near
our
camp
as
the
horses
came
up
one
by
one
the
loads
were
lifted
off
the
animals
turned
loose
and
after
their
dinner
of
buttered
tea
and
each
man
stretched
out
upon
the
ground
without
shelter
of
any
kind
and
heedless
of
the
freezing
cold
it
is
truly
the
life
of
primitive
man
and
has
bred
a
hardy
restless
independent
race
content
to
wander
over
the
boundless
steppes
and
demanding
from
the
outside
world
only
to

the

are
frequently
more

their

in

chair
of

we

photograph
the
tibetans
were
the
most
difficult
it
was
almost
impossible
to
bribe
them
with
money
or
tin
cans
to
stand
for
a
moment
and
when
they
saw
the

set
up

they
would
make
long
detours
to
avoid
passing
in

we

not
get
by

we
tried
to
do
by
stealth
and
concealed
ourselves
behind
bushes
with
the

focused
on
a
certain
spot
upon
the
road
the
instant
a
tibetan
discovered
it
he
would
run
like
a
frightened
deer
and
in
some
mysterious
way
they
seemed
to
have
passed
the
word
along
that
our
camp
was
a
spot
to
be
avoided
sometimes
a
bottle
was
too
great
a
temptation
to
be
resisted

one
would
stand
timidly
like
a

with
wings
half
spread

to
dash
away

though
the

were
after

he
carefully
tucked
the

given
for
advance

inside
his

with
a
great

of
bravery
allowed
me
to
place

dodged

drew
his
sword
waved
it
wildly
about
his

and
took
to
his
heels
yelling
at
the
top
of
his
lungs
he
was
frightened
to
death
and
when
he
disappeared
from
sight
at
a
curve
in
the
road
he
was
still
going
strong
with
his
coat

flapping
like

one
caravan
came
suddenly
upon
the

unawares
there
were
several
women
in
the
party
and
as
soon
as
the
men
realized
that
there
was
no
escape
each
one
dodged
behind
a
woman
keeping
her
between
him
and
the
camera
they
were
taking
no
chances
with
their
precious
selves
for
the
women
could
be
replaced
easily
enough
if
necessary
the
trouble
is
that
the
tibetan
not
unnaturally
has
the
greatest
possible
suspicion
and
dislike
for
strangers
the
chinese
he
loathes
and
despises
and
foreigners

knows
only
too
well
are
symptoms
of
missionaries
and
punitive
expeditions
or
other
disturbances
of
his
immemorial
peace
he
is
confirmed
in
his
attitude
by
the
church
which
throughout
tibet
has
the
monopoly
of
all
the
gold
in
the
country
and
the
church
utterly
declines
to
believe
that
any
foreigner
can
come
so
far
for
any
end

foolish
than

of

has
remarked
that
it
is
curious
how
little
impression
the
civilization
and
customs
of
the
chinese
have
produced
on
the
tibetans
elsewhere
one
of
the
principal
characteristics
of
chinese
expansion
is
its
power
of
absorbing
other
races
but
with
the
tibetans
exactly
the
reverse
takes
place
the
chinese
become
tibetanized
and
the
children
of
a
chinaman

to
a
tibetan
woman
are
usually
brought
up
in
the
tibetan
customs
probably
the
great
cause
which
keeps
the
tibetan
from
being
absorbed
is
the
cold
inhospitable
nature
of
his
country
there
is
little
to
tempt
the
chinese
to
emigrate
into
tibet
and
consequently
they
never
are
there
in
sufficient
numbers
to
influence
the
tibetans

them

chapter

westward
to
the
mekong
river
during
the
night
of
december
there
was
a
heavy
fall
of
snow
and
in
the
morning
we
awoke
to
find
ourselves
in
fairyland
we
were
living
in
a
great
white
palace
with
ceiling
and
walls
of
filmy
glittering
webs
the
long
delicate
strands
of
gray
moss
which
draped
themselves
from
tree
to
tree
and
branch
to
branch
were
each
one
converted
into
threads
of
crystal
forming
a
filigree
lacework
infinitely
beautiful
it
was
hard
to
break
camp
and
leave
that
silver
palace
for
every
vista
through
the
forest
seemed
more
lovely
than
the
one
before
but
we
knew
that
another
fall
of
snow
would
block
the
passes
and
shut
us
out
from
the
mekong
valley
the
even
refused
to
try
the
direct
route
across
the
mountains
to
and
insisted
on
going
southward
to
the
ferry
and
up
the
yangtze
river
on
the
main
caravan
route
it
was
a
long
trip
and
we
looked
forward
with
no
pleasure
to
eight
days
of
hard
riding
the
difficulty
in
obtaining
hunters
since
leaving
the
snow
mountain
had
made
our
big
game
collecting
negligible
although
we
had
traveled
through
some
excellent
country
the
mekong
valley
might
not
be
better
but
it
was
an
unknown
quantity
and
whether
or
not
it
yielded
specimens
the
results
from
a
survey
of
the
mammal
distribution
would
be
none
the
less
important
and
we
felt
that
it
must
be
done
otherwise
we
should
have
turned
our
backs
on
the
north
and
returned
to
fu
as
we
rode
down
the
mountain
trail
we
passed
caravan
after
caravan
of
tibetans
with
heavily
loaded
horses
all
bound
for
that
land
of
mystery
beyond
the
barriers
often
we
tried
to
stop
some
of
the
natives
and
persuade
them
to
pose
for
a
color
photograph
but
usually
they
only
shook
their
heads
stubbornly
and
hurried
past
with
averted
faces
we
finally
waylaid
a
chinese
and
a
tibetan
who
were
walking
together
the
chinaman
was
an
amiable
fellow
and
by
giving
each
of
them
a
glass
jam
tumbler
they
halted
a
moment
as
soon
as
the
photograph
had
been
taken
the
chinese
indicated
that
he
expected
us
to
produce
one
and
was
thoroughly
disgusted
when
we
showed
him
that
it
was
impossible
repassing
the
lolo
village
we
followed
the
river
gorge
at
the
upper
end
of
which
is
located
and
left
the
forests
when
we
emerged
on
the
main
road
from
the
top
of
a
ten
thousand
foot
pass
there
was
a
magnificent
view
down
the
cañon
to
the
mountains
which
were
beautiful
beyond
description
in
their
changing
colors
of
purple
and
gold
just
after
leaving
the
pass
we
met
a
caravan
of
several
hundred
horses
each
bearing
two
whole
pigs
bent
double
and
tied
to
the
saddles
the
animals
had
been
denuded
of
hair
salted
and
sewn
up
and
soon
would
be
distributed
among
the
villages
somewhere
in
the
interior
of
tibet
on
the
second
day
we
saw
before
us
seven
peaks
as
sharp
and
regular
as
the
teeth
of
a
saw
rising
above
the
mouth
of
the
stream
where
it
spreads
like
a
fan
over
a
sandy
delta
and
empties
into
the
yangtze
here
the
mighty
river
flowing
proudly
southward
from
its
home
in
the
steppes
of
the
forbidden
land
countless
ages
ago
found
the
great
snow
mountain
range
barring
its
path
thrust
aside
it
doubled
back
upon
itself
along
the
barrier
base
still
restlessly
seeking
a
passage
through
the
wall
of
rock
far
to
the
north
it
bit
hungrily
into
the
mountain
side
again
broke
through
and
swung
south
gathering
strength
and
volume
from
hundreds
of
tributaries
as
it
rushed
onward
to
the
sea
for
two
days
we
rode
along
the
river
bank
and
crossed
at
the
ferry
there
was
none
of
the
difficulty
here
which
we
had
experienced
at
taku
for
the
river
is
wide
and
the
current
slow
it
required
only
two
hours
to
transport
our
entire
caravan
while
at
the
other
ferry
we
had
waited
a
day
and
a
half
strangely
enough
although
there
are
dozens
of
villages
along
the
yangtze
and
the
valley
is
highly
cultivated
we
saw
no
sign
of
fishing
moreover
we
passed
but
three
boats
and
five
or
six
rafts
and
it
was
evident
that
this
great
waterway
which
for
fifteen
hundred
miles
from
its
mouth
influences
the
trade
of
china
so
profoundly
is
here
used
but
little
by
the
natives
on
the
ride
down
the
river
we
had
good
sport
with
the
huge
cranes
probably
which
in
small
flocks
were
feeding
along
the
river
fields
the
birds
stood
about
five
feet
high
and
we
could
see
their
great
black
and
white
bodies
and
black
necks
farther
than
a
man
was
visible
it
was
fairly
easy
to
stalk
them
to
within
a
hundred
yards
but
even
at
that
distance
they
offered
a
rather
small
target
for
they
were
so
largely
wings
neck
legs
and
tail
we
were
never
within
shotgun
range
and
indeed
it
would
be
difficult
to
kill
the
birds
with
anything
smaller
than
bb
or
buckshot
unless
they
were
very
near

shot
our

he
stole
upon
five
which
were
feeding
in
a
meadow
and
fired
while
two
were
lined
up
one
of
the
huge
birds
flapped
about
on
the
ground
for
a
few
moments
and
lay
still
but
the
larger
was
only
and
started
off
at
full
speed
across
the
fields
two
left
the
caravan
yelling
with
excitement
and
ran
for
nearly
half
a
mile
before
they
overtook
the
bird
then
they
were
kept
at
bay
for
fifteen
minutes
by
its
long
beak
which
is
a
really
formidable
weapon
as
food
the
cranes
were
perfectly
delicious
when
stuffed
with
chestnut
dressing
and
roasted
each
one
provided
two
meals
for
three
of
us
with
enough
left
over
for
hash
and
our
appetites
were
by
no
means
birdlike
although
the
natives
attempt
to
kill
cranes
they
are
not
often
successful
for
the
birds
are
very
watchful
and
will
not
allow
a
man
within
a
hundred
yards
such
a
distance
for
primitive
guns
or
crossbows
might
as
well
be
a
hundred
miles
but
with
our
rifles
we
were
able
to
shoot
as
many
as
were
needed
for
food
the
birds
almost
invariably
followed
the
river
when
flying
and
fed
in
the
rice
barley
and
corn
fields
not
far
from
the
water
it
was
an
inspiring
sight
to
see
a
flock
of
the
huge
birds
run
for
a
few
steps
along
the
ground
and
then
launch
themselves
into
the
air
their
black
and
white
wings
flashing
in
the
sunlight
they
formed
into
orderly
ranks
like
a
company
of
soldiers
or
strung
out
in
a
long
thin
line
across
the
sky
when
we
disturbed
a
flock
from
especially
desirable
feeding
grounds
they
would
sometimes
whirl
and
circle
above
the
fields
ascending
higher
and
higher
in
great
spirals
until
they
were
lost
to
sight
their
musical
voices
coming
faintly
down
to
us
like
the
distant
shouts
of
happy
children
when
we
returned
to
fu
in
early
january
cranes
were
very
abundant
in
the
fields
about
the
lake
they
had
arrived
in
late
october
and
would
depart
in
early
spring
according
to
evans
we
often
saw
the
birds
on
sand
banks
along
the
yangtze
but
they
were
usually
resting
or
quietly
walking
about
and
were
not
feeding
apparently
they
eat
only
rice
barley
corn
or
other
grain
this
species
was
discovered
by
the
great
traveler
and
naturalist
lieutenant
colonel
prjevalsky
who
found
it
in
the
region
of
tibet
and
it
was
later
recorded
by
prince
henri
from
in
the
tibetan
highlands
apparently
specimens
from
have
not
been
preserved
in
museums
and
the
bird
was
not
known
to
occur
in
this
portion
of
china
along
the
yangtze
on
our
way
westward
we
shot
a
good
many
mallard
ducks
and
ruddy
sheldrakes
the
latter
are
universally
known
as
brahminy
ducks
by
the
foreigners
in
burma
and
but
they
are
not
true
ducks
the
name
is
derived
from
the
bird
beautiful
buff
and
rufous
color
which
is
somewhat
like
that
of
the
robes
worn
by
the
brahmin
priests
in
america
the
name
sheldrake
is
applied
erroneously
to
the
mergansers
and
much
confusion
has
thus
arisen
for
the
two
are
quite
unrelated
and
belong
to
perfectly
distinct
groups
the
mergansers
have
narrow
hooked
beaks
quite
unlike
those
of
the
sheldrakes
and
their
habits
are
entirely
dissimilar
the
brahminy
ducks
although
rather
tough
are
not
bad
eating
we
usually
found
them
feeding
in
fields
not
far
from
the
river
or
in
flooded
rice
dykes
and
very
often
sitting
in
pairs
on
the
sand
banks
near
the
water
they
have
a
bisyllabic
rather
plaintive
note
which
is
peculiarly
fascinating
to
me
and
like
the
honk
of
the
canada
goose
awakens
memories
of
sodden
marshes
bobbing
decoys
and
a
leaden
sky
shot
through
with
lines
of
flying
birds
mallards
were
frequently
to
be
found
with
the
sheldrakes
and
we
had
good
shooting
along
the
river
and
in
ponds
and
rice
fields
we
also
saw
a
few
teal
but
they
were
by
no
means
abundant
pheasants
were
scarce
we
shot
a
few
along
the
road
and
near
some
of
our
camps
but
we
found
no
place
in
where
one
could
have
even
a
fair
day
shooting
without
the
aid
of
a
good
dog
this
is
strikingly
different
from
korea
where
in
a
walk
over
the
hillsides
a
dozen
or
more
pheasants
can
be
flushed
within
an
hour
after
two
and
days
travel
up
the
yangtze
we
turned
westward
toward
and
camped
on
a
beautiful
flat
plain
beside
a
stream
it
was
a
cold
clear
night
and
after
dinner
and
a
smoke
about
the
fire
we
all
turned
in
both
of
us
were
asleep
when
suddenly
a
perfect
bedlam
of
angry
exclamations
and
chinese
curses
roused
the
whole
camp
in
a
few
moments
wu
came
to
our
tent
almost
speechless
with
rage
and
stammered
damn
fool
soldiers
come
try
to
take
our
horses
say
if
no
give
them
horses
they
untie
loads
shall
i
tell
break
their
heads
we
did
not
entirely
understand
the
situation
but
it
seemed
quite
proper
to
give
the
permission
to
do
the
and
they
went
at
it
with
a
will
after
a
volley
of
blows
there
was
a
scamper
of
feet
on
the
frozen
ground
and
the
soldiers
retired
considerably
the
worse
for
wear
when
the
battle
was
over
wu
explained
matters
more
fully
it
appeared
that
a
large
detachment
of
soldiers
had
recently
passed
up
this
road
to
and
four
or
five
had
remained
behind
to
attend
to
the
transport
of
certain
supplies
seeing
an
opportunity
for
graft
the
soldiers
were
stopping
every
caravan
which
passed
and
threatening
to
commandeer
it
unless
the
gave
a
sufficient
bribe
to
buy
their
immunity
our
with
the
protection
which
foreigners
gave
them
had
paid
off
a
few
old
scores
with
interest
that
they
had
neglected
no
part
of
the
reckoning
was
quite
evident
when
next
morning
two
of
the
soldiers
came
to
apologize
for
their
mistake
one
of
them
had
a
black
and
swollen
eye
and
the
other
was
nursing
a
deep
cut
on
his
forehead
they
were
exceedingly
humble
and
did
not
venture
into
camp
until
they
had
been
assured
that
we
would
not
again
loose
our
terrible
upon
them
such
extortions
are
every
day
occurrences
in
many
parts
of
china
and
it
is
little
wonder
that
the
military
is
cordially
hated
and
feared
by
the
peasants
the
soldiers
taking
advantage
of
their
uniform
oppress
the
villagers
in
numberless
ways
from
which
there
is
no
redress
if
a
complaint
is
made
a
dozen
soldiers
stand
ready
to
swear
that
the
offense
was
justified
or
was
never
committed
and
the
poor
farmer
is
lucky
if
he
escapes
without
a
beating
or
some
more
severe
punishment
it
is
a
disgrace
to
china
that
such
conditions
are
allowed
to
exist
and
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
ere
many
years
have
passed
the
country
will
awake
to
a
proper
recognition
of
the
rights
of
the
individual
until
she
does
there
never
can
be
a
national
spirit
of
patriotism
in
china
and
without
patriotism
the
republic
can
be
one
in

chapter
xxiv
down
the
mekong
valley
on
december
we
had
tiffin
on
the
summit
of
a
twelve
thousand
foot
pass
in
a
beautiful
meadow
from
which
we
could
see
the
glistening
peaks
of
the
vast
mountain
range
which
forms
the
divide
in
the
afternoon
we
readied
and
camped
in
a
grove
of
splendid
pine
trees
on
a
hill
overlooking
the
city
the
place
was
rather
disappointing
after
the
shops
were
poor
and
it
was
difficult
to
buy
rice
even
though
the
entire
valley
was
devoted
to
paddy
fields
but
we
did
get
quantities
of
delicious
persimmons
wu
told
us
that
seven
different
languages
were
spoken
in
the
city
and
we
could
well
believe
it
for
we
recognized
mosos
lolos
chinese
and
tibetans
this
region
is
nearly
the
extreme
western
limit
of
the
moso
tribe
which
appears
not
to
extend
across
the
mekong
river
the
mandarin
at
received
us
hospitably
and
proved
to
be
one
of
the
most
courteous
officials
whom
we
met
in
we
were
sorry
to
learn
that
he
was
killed
in
a
horrible
way
only
a
few
weeks
after
our
visit
trouble
arose
with
the
peasants
over
the
tax
on
salt
and
fifteen
hundred
rebelled
attacked
the
city
and
captured
it
after
a
sharp
fight
it
was
reported
that
they
immediately
beheaded
the
wives
and
children
and
boiled
him
alive
in
oil
illustration
a
quiet
curve
of
the
mekong
river
although
the
magistrate
offered
to
assist
us
in
every
way
we
could
obtain
no
information
concerning
either
hunting
grounds
or
routes
of
travel
the
flying
squirrels
which
we
had
hoped
to
find
near
the
city
were
reported
to
come
from
a
mountain
range
beyond
the
mekong
in
burma
and
was
merely
a
center
of
distribution
for
the
skins
moreover
the
natives
said
it
would
be
impossible
to
obtain
squirrels
at
that
time
of
the
year
for
the
mountain
passes
were
so
heavily
covered
with
snow
that
neither
men
nor
caravans
could
cross
them
it
was
desirable
however
to
descend
to
the
mekong
river
in
order
to
determine
whether
there
would
be
a
change
in
fauna
and
on
major
davies
map
a
small
road
was
marked
down
the
valley
a
stiff
climb
of
a
day
and
a
half
over
a
thickly
forested
mountain
ridge
frozen
and
brought
us
in
sight
of
the
green
waters
of
the
mekong
which
has
carved
a
gorge
for
itself
in
an
almost
straight
line
from
the
bleak
tibetan
plateaus
through
and
to
the
sea
our
second
camp
was
on
the
river
at
the
mouth
of
a
deep
valley
near
a
small
village
wu
said
that
the
natives
were
lutzus
and
i
was
inclined
to
believe
he
was
right
although
major
davies
indicates
this
region
to
be
inhabited
by
lisos
at
any
rate
these
people
both
in
physical
appearance
and
dress
were
quite
distinct
from
the
lisos
whom
we
met
later
they
were
exceedingly
pleasant
and
friendly
and
the
chief
accompanied
by
four
venerable
men
brought
a
present
of
rice
i
gave
him
two
tins
of
cigarettes
and
the
natives
returned
to
the
village
wreathed
in
smiles
the
garments
of
the
lutzus
were
characteristic
and
quite
unlike
those
of
the
mosos
lisos
or
tibetans
the
women
wore
a
long
coat
or
jacket
of
blue
cloth
trousers
and
a
very
full
pleated
skirt
the
men
were
dressed
in
plum
colored
coats
and
trousers
the
natives
said
that
monkeys
probably
were
often
seen
when
the
corn
was
ripe
and
that
even
yet
they
might
be
found
in
the
forest
across
the
river
heller
spent
a
day
hunting
them
but
found
none
and
we
obtained
only
one
new
mammal
in
our
traps
it
was
a
tiny
mouse
but
the
remainder
of
the
fauna
was
essentially
the
same
as
that
of
the
yangtze
valley
and
the
intervening
country
for
three
days
we
traveled
down
the
mekong
river
although
the
natives
said
that
the
trail
was
good
we
discovered
when
it
was
too
late
that
it
was
too
narrow
and
difficult
to
make
it
practicable
for
a
caravan
such
as
ours
it
was
necessary
to
continually
remove
the
loads
in
order
to
lift
them
around
sharp
corners
or
over
rocks
and
the
sometimes
had
to
cut
away
great
sections
of
the
bank
usually
only
six
or
seven
miles
could
be
traversed
after
eight
or
nine
hours
of
exhausting
work
and
we
were
glad
when
we
could
leave
the
river
the
mekong
on
an
average
is
not
more
than
a
hundred
yards
wide
in
this
region
and
like
the
yangtze
the
water
is
very
green
from
the
tibetan
snows
the
prevailing
rock
is
red
slate
or
sandstone
instead
of
limestone
as
in
the
country
to
the
eastward
and
the
sides
of
the
valley
are
so
precipitous
that
it
seems
impossible
for
a
human
being
to
walk
over
them
and
yet
they
are
patched
with
brown
corn
fields
from
the
summit
to
the
water
considering
the
small
area
available
for
cultivation
there
are
a
considerable
number
of
inhabitants
who
have
gathered
into
villages
and
seldom
live
in
isolated
houses
as
in
the
yangtze
valley
wherever
a
stream
comes
down
from
the
or
can
be
diverted
by
irrigating
ditches
the
ground
is
beautifully
terraced
for
rice
paddys
but
in
other
places
corn
and
peas
appear
to
be
the
principal
crops
very
few
vegetables
such
as
turnips
squash
carrots
or
potatoes
are
raised
which
is
rather
remarkable
as
they
are
so
abundant
in
all
the
country
between
the
mekong
and
the
yangtze
rivers
in
several
places
the
water
was
spanned
by
rope
bridges
the
cables
are
made
of
twisted
bamboo
and
as
one
end
must
necessarily
be
higher
than
the
other
there
are
always
two
ropes
one
to
cross
each
way
the
traveler
is
tied
by
leather
thongs
in
a
sitting
position
to
a
wooden
runner
which
slides
along
the
bamboo
cable
and
shoots
across
the
river
at
tremendous
speed
the
valley
is
hopeless
from
a
zoölogical
standpoint
it
is
too
dry
for
small
mammals
and
the
mountain
slopes
are
so
precipitous
thinly
forested
and
generally
undesirable
that
except
for
gorals
no
other
large
game
would
live
there
the
bird
life
is
decidedly
uninteresting
there
are
no
cranes
or
sheldrakes
and
except
for
a
few
flocks
of
mallards
which
feed
in
the
rice
fields
we
saw
no
other
ducks
or
geese
on
december
we
turned
away
from
the
mekong
valley
and
began
to
march
southeast
by
east
across
an
unmapped
region
toward
fu
we
camped
at
night
on
a
pretty
ridge
thickly
covered
with
spruce
trees
just
above
a
deep
moist
ravine
in
the
morning
our
traps
contained
several
rare
shrews
five
silver
moles
a
number
of
interesting
mice
and
a
beautiful
rufous
spiny
rat
it
was
too
good
a
place
to
leave
and
i
sent
hotenfa
to
inquire
from
a
family
of
natives
if
there
was
big
game
of
any
sort
in
the
vicinity
he
reported
that
there
were
goral
not
far
away
and
at
half
past
eight
we
rode
down
the
trail
for
three
miles
when
i
left
my
horse
at
a
peasant
house
they
told
us
that
the
goral
were
on
a
rocky
thinly
forested
mountain
which
rose
two
thousand
feet
above
the
valley
and
for
an
hour
and
a
half
we
climbed
steadily
upward
we
were
resting
near
the
summit
on
the
rim
of
a
deep
cañon
when
hotenfa
excitedly
whispered
and
held
up
three
fingers
he
tried
to
show
the
animals
to
me
and
at
last
i
caught
sight
of
what
i
thought
was
a
goral
standing
on
a
narrow
ledge
i
fired
and
a
bit
of
rock
flew
into
the
air
while
the
three
gorals
disappeared
among
the
trees
two
hundred
feet
above
the
spot
where
i
had
supposed
them
to
be
i
was
utterly
disgusted
at
my
mistake
but
we
started
on
a
run
for
the
other
side
of
the
gorge
when
we
arrived
hotenfa
motioned
me
to
swing
about
to
the
right
while
he
climbed
along
the
face
of
the
rock
wall
no
sooner
had
he
reached
the
edge
of
the
precipice
than
i
saw
him
lean
far
out
fire
with
my
gun
and
frantically
wave
for
me
to
come
i
ran
to
him
and
throwing
my
arms
about
a
projecting
shrub
looked
down
there
directly
under
us
stood
a
huge
goral
but
just
as
i
was
about
to
shoot
the
earth
gave
way
beneath
my
feet
and
i
would
have
fallen
squarely
on
the
animal
had
hotenfa
not
seized
me
by
the
collar
and
drawn
me
back
to
safety
the
goral
had
not
discovered
where
the
shower
of
dirt
and
stones
came
from
before
i
fired
hurriedly
breaking
his
fore
leg
at
the
knee
without
the
slightest
sign
of
injury
the
ram
disappeared
behind
a
corner
of
the
rock
i
dashed
to
the
top
of
the
ridge
in
time
to
see
him
running
at
full
speed
across
a
narrow
open
ledge
toward
a
thick
mass
of
cover
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
cañon
i
fired
just
as
the
animal
gained
the
trees
and
at
the
crash
of
my
rifle
the
goral
plunged
headlong
down
the
mountain
stone
dead
it
fell
on
a
narrow
slide
of
loose
rock
which
led
nearly
to
the
bottom
of
the
valley
and
slipping
and
rolling
in
a
cloud
of
red
dust
dropped
over
a
precipice
the
ram
brought
up
against
an
unstable
boulder
five
hundred
feet
below
us
and
it
required
half
an
hour
hard
work
to
reach
the
spot
when
i
finally
lifted
its
head
one
of
the
horns
which
had
been
broken
in
the
fall
slipped
through
my
fingers
and
away
went
the
goral
on
another
rough
and
tumble
descent
finally
stopping
on
a
rock
ledge
nearly
eleven
hundred
feet
from
the
place
where
it
had
been
shot
we
returned
to
camp
at
noon
bringing
joy
with
us
for
as
my
wife
had
remarked
the
day
before
we
will
soon
have
to
eat
chickens
or
cans
heller
hunted
the
gorals
unsuccessfully
the
following
day
and
we
left
on
december
camping
at
night
on
a
flat
terrace
beside
a
stream
at
the
end
of
a
moist
ravine
we
intended
to
spend
christmas
here
for
it
was
a
beautiful
spot
surrounded
by
virgin
forest
but
our
celebration
was
to
be
on
christmas
eve
the
following
day
dawned
bright
and
clear
there
had
not
been
a
drop
of
rain
for
nearly
a
month
and
the
weather
was
just
warm
enough
for
comfort
in
the
sun
with
one
coat
off
but
at
night
the
temperature
dropped
to
about
or
fahr
the
camp
proved
to
be
a
good
one
giving
us
two
new
mammals
and
just
after
tiffin
hotenfa
came
running
in
to
report
that
he
had
discovered
seven
gray
monkeys
probably
in
a
cornfield
a
mile
away
the
monkeys
had
disappeared
ere
we
arrived
but
while
we
were
gone
yvette
had
been
busy
and
just
before
dinner
she
ushered
us
into
our
tent
with
great
ceremony
it
had
been
most
wonderfully
transformed
at
the
far
end
stood
a
christmas
tree
blazing
with
tiny
candles
and
surrounded
by
masses
of
white
cotton
through
which
shone
red
holly
berries
holly
branches
from
the
forest
and
spruce
boughs
lined
the
tent
and
hung
in
green
waves
from
the
ridge
pole
at
the
base
of
the
tree
gifts
which
she
had
purchased
in
hongkong
in
the
preceding
august
were
laid
out
heller
mixed
a
fearful
and
wonderful
cocktail
from
the
chinese
wine
and
orange
juice
and
we
drank
to
each
other
and
to
those
at
home
while
sitting
on
the
ground
and
opening
our
packages
we
had
purchased
two
tibetan
rugs
in
and
as
christmas
presents
for
yvette
these
rugs
usually
are
blue
or
red
with
intricate
designs
in
the
center
and
are
well
woven
and
attractive
to
the
servants
and
we
gave
money
and
cigarettes
when
the
muleteers
were
brought
to
the
tent
to
receive
their
gifts
they
evidently
thought
our
blazing
tree
represented
an
altar
for
they
kneeled
down
and
began
to
make
the
chin
chin
joss
which
is
always
done
before
their
heathen
gods
our
christmas
dinner
was
a
masterpiece
four
days
previously
i
had
shot
a
pair
of
mallard
ducks
and
they
formed
the
de
the
dinner
consisted
of
soup
ducks
stuffed
with
chestnuts
currant
jelly
baked
squash
creamed
carrots
chocolate
cake
cheese
and
crackers
coffee
and
cigarettes
christmas
day
we
traveled
and
in
the
late
afternoon
passed
through
a
very
dirty
chinese
town
in
a
deep
valley
near
some
extensive
salt
wells
red
clay
dust
lay
thick
over
everything
and
the
filth
of
the
streets
and
houses
was
indescribable
we
camped
in
a
cornfield
a
mile
beyond
the
village
but
were
greatly
annoyed
by
the
chinese
who
insisted
on
swarming
into
camp
finally
unable
longer
to
endure
their
insolent
stares
i
drove
them
with
stones
to
the
top
of
the
hill
where
they
sat
in
row
upon
row
exactly
as
in
the
bleachers
at
an
american
baseball
game
when
we
left
the
following
day
we
passed
dozens
of
caravans
and
groups
of
men
and
women
carrying
great
disks
of
salt
each
piece
was
stamped
in
red
with
the
official
mark
for
salt
is
a
government
monopoly
and
only
licensed
merchants
are
allowed
to
deal
in
it
moreover
the
importation
of
salt
from
foreign
countries
is
forbidden
for
the
purposes
of
administration
china
is
divided
into
seven
or
eight
main
circuits
each
of
which
has
its
own
sources
of
production
and
the
salt
obtained
in
one
district
may
not
be
sold
in
another
in
the
salt
of
the
province
is
supplied
from
three
regions
the
water
from
the
wells
is
boiled
in
great
cauldrons
for
several
days
and
the
resulting
deposit
is
earth
impregnated
with
salt
this
is
crushed
mixed
with
water
and
boiled
again
until
only
pure
salt
remains
after
passing
a
village
of
considerable
size
called
peiping
we
began
the
ascent
of
an
exceedingly
steep
mountain
range
twelve
thousand
feet
high
all
the
afternoon
we
toiled
upward
in
the
rain
and
camped
late
in
the
evening
at
a
pine
grove
on
a
little
plateau
of
the
way
to
the
summit
during
the
night
it
snowed
heavily
and
we
awoke
to
find
ourselves
in
a
transformed
world
every
tree
and
bush
was
dressed
in
garments
of
purest
white
and
between
the
branches
we
could
look
westward
across
the
valley
toward
the
mekong
and
the
purple
mountain
wall
of
the
burma
border
there
were
still
one
thousand
feet
of
climbing
between
us
and
the
summit
of
the
pass
the
trail
was
almost
blocked
but
by
slow
work
we
forced
our
way
through
the
drifts
some
of
the
mules
were
already
weak
from
exposure
and
underfeeding
and
two
of
them
had
to
be
relieved
of
their
loads
they
died
the
next
day
our
did
not
appear
to
suffer
greatly
although
their
legs
were
bare
from
the
knees
down
and
their
feet
had
no
covering
except
straw
sandals
indeed
when
we
discovered
on
the
summit
of
the
pass
a
tiny
hut
in
which
a
fire
was
burning
they
waited
only
a
few
moments
to
warm
themselves
we
met
two
other
caravans
fighting
their
way
up
the
mountain
from
the
other
side
and
by
following
the
trail
which
they
had
broken
through
the
drifts
we
made
fairly
good
time
on
the
descent
there
had
been
no
snow
on
the
broad
flat
plain
which
we
reached
in
the
late
afternoon
and
we
found
that
its
ponds
and
fields
were
alive
with
ducks
geese
and
cranes
the
birds
were
wild
but
we
had
good
shooting
when
we
broke
camp
in
the
morning
and
killed
enough
to
last
us
several
days
on
december
our
weary
days
of
crossing
range
after
range
of
tremendous
mountains
were
ended
and
we
stood
on
the
last
pass
looking
down
upon
the
great
plain
outside
the
grim
walls
of
the
old
city
which
lies
on
the
main
fu
road
are
two
large
marshy
ponds
and
away
to
the
south
is
an
extensive
lake
we
camped
just
without
the
courtyard
of
a
fine
temple
and
at
four
yvette
and
i
went
over
to
the
water
which
was
swarming
with
ducks
and
geese
neither
of
us
will
ever
forget
that
shoot
in
the
glorious
afternoon
sunlight
cloud
after
cloud
of
ducks
rose
as
we
neared
the
pond
and
circled
high
above
our
heads
but
now
and
then
a
straggling
mallard
or
pin
tail
would
swing
across
the
sky
within
range
as
my
gun
roared
out
the
birds
would
whirl
to
the
ground
like
feathered
bombs
or
climb
higher
with
frightened
quacks
if
the
shot
went
wild
an
hour
before
dark
the
brahminy
ducks
began
to
come
in
we
could
hear
their
melodious
plaintive
calls
long
before
we
could
see
the
birds
and
we
flattened
ourselves
out
in
the
grass
and
mud
soon
a
thin
black
line
would
streak
the
sky
and
as
they
drew
nearer
yvette
would
draw
such
seductive
notes
from
a
tiny
horn
of
wood
and
bone
that
the
flock
would
swing
and
dive
toward
us
in
a
rush
of
flashing
wings
when
we
could
see
the
brown
bodies
right
above
our
heads
i
would
sit
up
and
bang
away
now
and
then
a
big
white
goose
would
drop
into
the
pond
or
an
ibis
flap
lazily
overhead
seeming
to
realize
that
it
had
nothing
to
fear
from
the
prostrate
bodies
which
spat
fire
at
other
birds
the
stillness
of
the
marsh
was
absolute
save
for
the
voices
of
the
water
fowl
mingled
in
the
wild
sweet
clamor
so
dear
to
the
heart
of
every
sportsman
as
the
day
began
to
die
hung
about
with
ducks
and
geese
we
walked
slowly
back
across
the
rice
fields
to
the
yellow
fires
before
our
tents
it
was
our
last
camp
for
the
year
and
as
if
to
bid
us
farewell
as
we
journeyed
toward
the
tropics
the
peaks
of
the
great
snow
mountain
far
to
the
north
had
draped
themselves
in
a
gorgeous
silver
mantle
and
glistened
against
a
sky
of
lavender
and
gold
like
white
cathedral
spires
on
january
we
camped
early
in
the
afternoon
on
a
beautiful
little
plain
beside
a
spring
overhung
with
giant
trees
at
the
head
of
erh
hai
or
fu
lake
which
is
thirty
miles
long
the
fields
and
marshes
were
alive
with
ducks
geese
cranes
and
lapwings
and
we
had
a
glorious
day
of
sport
over
decoys
and
on
the
water
before
we
went
on
to
fu
evans
was
about
to
leave
for
a
long
business
trip
to
the
south
of
the
province
and
we
took
possession
of
a
pretty
temple
just
within
the
north
gate
of
the
city
here
we
read
a
great
accumulation
of
mail
and
learned
that
a
thousand
pounds
of
supplies
which
we
had
ordered
from
hongkong
had
just
arrived
through
the
good
offices
of
howard
page
manager
of
the
standard
oil
company
of
fu
their
passage
through
tonking
had
been
facilitated
and
he
had
dispatched
the
boxes
by
caravan
to
fu
mr
page
rendered
great
assistance
to
the
expedition
in
numberless
ways
and
to
him
we
owe
our
personal
thanks
as
well
as
those
of
the
american
museum
of
natural
history
all
the
servants
except
our
faithful
wu
left
at
fu
but
with
the
aid
of
hanna
we
obtained
a
much
better
personnel
for
the
trip
to
the
burma
frontier
the
cook
who
was
one
of
hanna
converts
was
an
especially
fine
fellow
and
proved
to
be
as
energetic
and
competent
as
the
other
had
been
lazy
and
helpless
our
work
in
the
north
had
brought
us
a
collection
of
thirteen
hundred
mammals
as
well
as
several
hundred
birds
much
material
for
habitat
groups
and
a
splendid
series
of
photographic
records
in
paget
color
plates
black
and
white
negatives
and
motion
picture
film
but
what
was
of
first
importance
we
had
covered
an
enormous
extent
of
diverse
country
and
learned
much
about
the
distribution
of
the
fauna
of
northern
the
thirteen
hundred
mammals
of
our
collection
were
taken
in
a
more
or
less
continuous
line
across
six
tremendous
mountain
ranges
and
furnish
an
illuminating
cross
section
of
the
entire
region
from
fu
north
to
and
west
to
the
mekong
river
illustration
the
temple
in
which
we
camped
at
fu
illustration
a
crested
muntjac
it
is
apparent
that
in
this
part
of
the
province
which
is
all
within
one
life
zone
even
the
smallest
mammals
are
widely
spread
and
that
the
principal
factor
in
determining
distribution
is
the
flora
neither
the
highest
mountain
ridges
nor
such
deep
swift
rivers
as
the
yangtze
and
the
mekong
appear
to
act
as
effective
barriers
to
migration
and
as
long
as
the
vegetation
remains
constant
the
fauna
changes
but
little
chapter
xxv
missionaries
we
have
known
during
our
work
in
fukien
province
and
in
various
parts
of
we
came
into
intimate
personal
contact
with
a
great
many
missionaries
indeed
every
traveler
in
the
interior
of
china
will
meet
them
unless
he
purposely
avoids
doing
so
but
the
average
tourist
seldom
sees
the
missionary
in
his
native
habitat
because
for
the
most
part
he
lives
and
works
where
the
tourist
does
not
go
nevertheless
that
does
not
prevent
the
coastwise
traveler
from
carrying
back
with
him
from
the
east
a
very
definite
impression
of
the
missionary
which
he
has
gained
on
board
ships
or
in
oriental
clubs
where
he
hears
him
damned
with
faint
praise
almost
unconsciously
he
adopts
the
popular
attitude
just
as
he
enlarges
his
vocabulary
to
include
pidgin
english
and
such
unfamiliar
phrases
as
tiffin
bund
and
cumshaw
this
chapter
is
not
a
brief
for
the
missionary
but
simply
a
matter
of
fair
play
we
feel
that
in
justice
we
ought
to
present
our
observations
upon
this
subject
which
is
one
of
very
general
interest
as
impartially
as
upon
any
phase
of
our
scientific
work
but
it
should
be
distinctly
understood
that
we
are
writing
of
those
persons
whom
we
met
and
lived
with
and
whose
work
we
had
an
opportunity
to
know
and
to
see
are
not
attempting
generalizations
on
the
accomplishments
of
missionaries
in
any
other
part
of
there
are
three
charges
which
we
have
heard
most
frequently
brought
against
the
missionary
that
he
comes
to
the
east
because
he
can
live
better
and
more
luxuriously
than
he
can
at
home
that
he
often
engages
in
lucrative
trade
with
the
natives
and
that
he
accomplishes
little
good
either
religious
or
otherwise
it
is
said
that
his
converts
are
only
rice
christians
and
foreigners
have
often
warned
us
in
this
manner
do
take
christian
servants
they
are
more
dishonest
and
unreliable
than
any
others
it
is
often
true
that
the
finest
house
in
a
chinese
town
will
be
that
of
the
resident
missionary
in
the
mission
buildings
are
imposing
structures
and
are
placed
upon
a
hill
above
and
away
from
the
rest
of
the
city
any
white
person
who
has
traveled
in
the
interior
of
china
will
remember
the
airless
lightless
native
houses
opening
as
they
all
do
on
filthy
streets
and
reeking
sewers
and
he
will
understand
that
in
order
to
exist
at
all
a
foreigner
must
be
somewhat
isolated
and
live
in
a
clean
house
every
missionary
in
china
employs
servants
many
more
servants
than
he
could
afford
at
home
so
does
every
other
foreigner
whatever
his
vocation
there
is
no
such
thing
in
china
as
the
democracy
of
the
west
and
the
missionary
status
in
the
community
demands
that
certain
work
in
his
house
be
done
by
servants
otherwise
he
and
his
family
would
be
placed
on
a
level
with
the
coolie
class
and
the
value
of
his
words
and
deeds
be
discounted
but
the
chief
reason
is
that
the
wife
almost
always
has
definite
duties
to
which
she
could
not
attend
if
she
were
not
relieved
from
some
of
the
household
cares
she
leads
in
work
among
the
women
of
the
community
by
organizing
clubs
and
mutual
improvement
societies
and
in
teaching
in
the
schools
or
hospitals
where
young
men
and
women
are
learning
english
as
an
asset
to
medical
work
among
their
own
people
servants
are
unbelievably
cheap
while
we
were
in
foochow
a
cook
received
gold
per
month
a
laundryman
gold
per
month
and
other
wages
were
in
proportion
in
fukien
province
the
missionaries
receive
two
months
vacation
anyone
who
has
lived
through
a
fukien
summer
in
the
interior
of
the
province
will
know
why
the
missionaries
are
given
this
vacation
if
they
were
not
able
to
leave
the
deadly
heat
and
filth
and
disease
of
the
native
cities
for
a
few
weeks
every
year
there
would
be
no
missionaries
to
carry
on
the
work
the
business
man
can
surround
himself
with
innumerable
comforts
both
in
his
home
and
in
his
office
which
the
missionary
can
not
afford
and
during
the
summer
life
is
not
only
made
possible
thereby
but
even
pleasant
is
eight
days
travel
from
foochow
up
the
min
river
and
it
is
by
no
means
the
most
remote
station
in
the
province
very
few
travelers
reach
these
places
during
the
year
and
the
white
inhabitants
are
almost
isolated
miss
mabel
hartford
lives
alone
at
yuchi
and
at
one
time
she
saw
only
one
foreigner
in
eight
months
miss
cordelia
morgan
is
the
sole
foreign
resident
of
fu
a
large
chinese
city
six
days
from
fu
in
fu
reverend
william
hanna
his
wife
and
two
other
women
are
fourteen
days
ride
from
the
nearest
foreign
settlement
in
reverend
and
kok
and
their
three
small
children
live
with
two
women
missionaries
they
are
days
travel
from
a
doctor
and
for
four
years
previous
to
our
visit
they
had
not
seen
a
white
woman
these
are
some
instances
of
missionaries
whom
we
met
in
china
who
have
voluntarily
exiled
themselves
to
remote
places
where
they
expect
to
spend
their
entire
lives
surrounded
by
an
indifferent
if
not
hostile
population
can
anyone
possibly
believe
that
they
have
chosen
this
life
because
it
is
easier
or
more
luxurious
than
that
at
home
some
of
the
men
whom
we
met
had
left
lucrative
business
positions
to
take
up
medical
or
evangelistic
work
in
china
where
their
compensation
is
pitifully
small
not
of
the
salary
they
were
commanding
at
home
we
did
not
meet
any
missionaries
who
were
engaging
in
trade
with
the
natives
even
though
in
some
places
there
were
excellent
business
opportunities
consider
the
doctors
as
examples
of
the
civilizing
influences
which
missionaries
bring
with
them
we
saw
them
in
various
parts
of
china
doing
a
magnificent
wort
bradley
has
established
a
great
leper
hospital
at
where
these
human
outcasts
are
receiving
the
latest
and
most
scientific
treatment
and
beginning
to
look
at
life
with
a
new
hope
in
at
the
time
of
the
rebellion
we
saw
trimble
working
hour
after
hour
over
wounded
and
broken
men
without
a
thought
of
rest
in
fu
thompson
hospital
was
filled
with
patients
suffering
from
almost
every
known
disease
in
fu
we
saw
hanna
and
his
wife
dispensing
medicines
and
treating
the
minor
ills
of
patients
waiting
by
the
dozen
the
fees
received
being
not
enough
to
pay
for
the
cost
of
the
medicines
why
is
it
that
every
traveling
foreigner
in
the
interior
of
china
is
supposed
to
be
able
to
cure
diseases
certainly
an
important
reason
is
because
of
the
work
done
by
the
medical
missionaries
who
have
penetrated
to
the
farthest
corners
of
the
most
remote
provinces
aside
from
their
medical
work
missionaries
are
in
many
instances
the
real
pioneers
of
western
civilization
they
bring
to
the
people
new
standards
of
living
both
morally
and
physically
they
open
schools
and
emancipate
the
chinese
children
in
mind
and
body
they
fight
the
barbarous
customs
of
foot
binding
and
the
killing
and
selling
of
girl
babies
until
recent
years
it
was
not
unusual
to
meet
the
village
baby
peddler
with
from
two
to
six
tiny
infants
peddling
his
goods
from
village
to
village
not
many
years
ago
such
a
man
appeared
before
the
mission
compound
at
fukien
with
four
babies
in
his
basket
three
of
these
had
expired
from
exposure
and
the
kerosene
oil
which
had
been
poured
down
their
throats
to
stupefy
them
and
drown
their
cries
the
fourth
was
purchased
by
the
wife
of
the
native
preacher
for
ten
cents
in
order
to
save
its
life
this
child
was
reared
and
has
since
graduated
from
the
mission
schools
with
credit
in
foochow
a
stone
tablet
bearing
the
following
inscription
stands
beside
a
stagnant
pool
hereafter
the
throwing
of
babies
into
this
pool
will
be
punished
by
law
this
was
a
result
of
the
work
of
the
missionaries
their
task
is
by
no
means
easy
and
as
hanna
once
remarked
province
has
broken
the
heart
of
more
than
one
missionary
the
chinese
do
not
understand
their
point
of
view
and
it
is
difficult
to
make
them
see
it
a
chinaman
is
a
rank
materialist
and
pure
altruism
does
not
enter
into
his
scheme
of
life
as
a
rule
he
has
but
two
thoughts
his
stomach
and
his
cash
bag
it
is
impossible
to
make
him
realize
that
the
missionary
has
not
come
with
an
ulterior
motive
if
not
to
engage
in
trade
perhaps
as
a
spy
for
his
government
others
believe
that
it
is
because
china
is
so
vastly
superior
to
the
rest
of
the
world
that
the
missionaries
wish
to
live
there
eventually
the
suspicions
of
the
natives
become
quieted
and
they
accept
the
missionary
at
some
part
of
his
true
worth
at
the
time
of
the
rebellion
in
we
saw
harry
caldwell
bankhardt
and
trimble
save
the
lives
of
hundreds
of
people
and
the
city
from
partial
destruction
because
the
chinese
officers
of
the
opposing
forces
would
trust
the
missionaries
when
they
would
not
trust
each
other
an
excellent
piece
of
practical
missionary
work
was
done
in
fukien
province
not
long
after
our
visit
there
as
we
have
related
in
chapter
iii
several
large
bands
of
brigands
were
established
in
the
hills
about
yuchi
brigandage
began
there
in
the
following
way
during
a
famine
when
the
people
were
on
the
verge
of
starvation
a
wealthy
farmer
su
ek
by
name
decided
to
do
his
share
in
relieving
conditions
by
offering
for
sale
a
quantity
of
rice
which
he
had
accumulated
he
approached
another
man
of
similar
wealth
who
agreed
with
him
to
sell
his
grain
at
a
reasonable
price
su
ek
accordingly
disposed
of
his
rice
to
the
suffering
people
and
when
he
had
remaining
only
enough
to
sustain
his
own
family
until
the
following
harvest
he
sent
the
peasants
to
the
second
man
who
had
also
agreed
to
dispose
of
his
grain
this
farmer
refused
to
sell
at
the
stipulated
price
and
the
people
angered
at
his
treachery
looted
his
sheds
he
immediately
went
to
foochow
and
reported
to
the
governor
that
there
was
a
band
of
brigands
abroad
in
yuchi
county
under
the
leadership
of
su
ek
and
that
they
had
robbed
and
plundered
his
property
without
warning
a
company
of
soldiers
swooped
down
upon
the
community
and
arrested
a
number
of
men
whose
names
the
informer
had
given
su
ek
made
his
escape
to
the
hills
but
he
was
pursued
as
a
brigand
chief
and
was
later
joined
by
other
farmers
who
had
been
similarly
persecuted
unable
to
return
to
their

surrender

broke

ever
be

of
what
actually
took
place
under
the

of
settling
brigandage
behind

separate
yuchi
from

outer
world
it
is
well
that
it
should
not
be
known
during
the
spring
of
a
missionary
visited
yuchi
business
called
him
outside
the
city
wall
and
just
beyond
the
west
gate
he
saw
the
bodies
of
ten
persons
who
had
that
day
been
executed
among
these
were
two
children
brothers
the
sons
of
a
man
who
was
reported
to
have
sold
rice
to
the
brigands
the
smaller
child
had
wept
and
pleaded
to
be
permitted
to
kneel
beside
his
older
brother
further
up
in
the
row
he
was
too
small
to
realize
what
it
all
meant
but
he
wanted
to
die
beside
his
brother
in
the
middle
of
the
field
lay
a
man
whose
head
was
partly
severed
from
his
body
and
who
had
been
shot
through
and
through
by
the
soldiers
he
was
lying
upon
his
back
in
the
broiling
sun
pleading
for
a
cup
of
tea
or
for
someone
to
put
him
out
of
his
misery
the
missionary
learned
the
man
story
it
appeared
that
years
ago
a
law
suit
in
which
his
father
had
been
concerned
had
been
decided
in
his
favor
in
order
to
square
the
score
between
the
clans
the
son
of
the
man
who
had
lost
the
suit
had
reported
that
he
had
seen
this
man
carrying
rice
to
the
brigands
he
had
been
arrested
by
the
soldiers
partially
killed
and
left
to
lie
in
the
glaring
sun
from
nine
in
the
morning
until
dark
suffering
the
agonies
of
crucifixion
not
one
of
those
who
heard
his
moans
dared
to
moisten
the
parched
lips
with
tea
lest
he
too
be
executed
for
having
administered
to
a
brigand
the
missionary
returned
to
the
city
that
night
vowing
that
he
would
make
a
recurrence
of
such
a
thing
impossible
or
he
would
leave
china
he
took
up
the
matter
with
the
authorities
in
peking
in
a
quiet
way
and
later
with
the
military
governor
in
foochow
he
was
well
known
to
the
brigands
by
reputation
and
visited
several
of
the
chiefs
in
their
strongholds
they
declared
that
they
had
confidence
in
him
but
none
in
the
government
or
its
representatives
it
was
only
after
assuming
full
responsibility
for
any
treachery
that
the
brigands
agreed
to
discuss
terms
upon
invitation
to
accompany
him
to
the
township
the
missionary
was
escorted
out
to
civilization
by
picked
men
to
whom
the
chief
had
entrusted
an
important
charge
as
the
group
neared
the
township
the
missionary
sent
word
ahead
to
the
commander
of
the
northern
soldiers
to
prepare
to
receive
the
brigands

forming
into
squads
outside
the
barracks
instantly
the
brigands
halted
snapped
back
the
bolts
of
their
rifles
and
threw
in
shells
the
missionary
realized
that

followed
resulted
in
several
hundred
pardons
being
distributed
to
the

by

missionary
himself
the
men
then
returned
to
their
abandoned
homes
and
again
took
up
their
lives
as
respectable
farmers

the
reign
of
terror
in

portion
of

province
was
ended

the
efforts

chapter

chinese
new
year
at
the
last
half
of
the
expedition
began
january
when
we
left
fu
with
a
caravan
of
thirty
miles
for
eight
days
travel
to
the
south
the
although
they
had
promised
faithfully
to
come
at
daylight
did
not
arrive
until
nearly
noon
and
in
consequence
it
was
necessary
to
camp
at
at
the
foot
of
the
lake
we
improved
our
time
there
in
hunting
about
for
skins
and
finally
purchased
two
fine
leopards
and
a
tiger
the
latter
had
been
brought
from
the
tonking
frontier
there
were
a
number
of
tibetans
wandering
about
the
market
place
and
in
the
morning
a
caravan
of
at
least
two
hundred
horses
followed
by
twenty
or
thirty
tibetans
passed
into
the
city
while
it
was
yet
gray
dawn
they
were
bringing
tea
from
and
in
the
south
of
the
province
and
although
they
had
already
been
nearly
a
month
upon
their
journey
there
was
still
many
long
weeks
of
travel
before
them
ere
they
reached
the
steppes
of
their
native
land
the
trip
to
proved
uninteresting
and
uneventful
we
crossed
a
succession
of
dry
thinly
forested
mountains
from
to
feet
high
which
near
their
summits
were
often
clothed
with
a
thick
growth
of
rhododendron
trees
the
beautiful
red
flowers
flashed
like
fire
balls
among
the
green
leaves
peach
trees
were
in
full
blossom
and
in
some
spots
the
dry
hills
seemed
about
to
break
forth
in
the
full
glory
of
their
spring
verdure
we
crossed
the
mekong
near
a
village
called
on
a
picturesque
chain
suspension
bridge
of
a
type
which
is
not
unusual
in
the
southern
and
western
part
of
the
province
several
heavy
iron
chains
are
firmly
fastened
to
huge
rock
piers
on
opposite
sides
of
the
river
and
the
roadway
formed
by
planks
laid
upon
them
although
the
bridge
shakes
and
swings
in
a
rather
alarming
manner
when
a
caravan
is
crossing
it
is
perfectly
safe
if
not
too
heavily
loaded
in
the
afternoon
of
january
we
rode
down
the
mountain
to
the
great
plain
and
for
two
hours
trotted
over
a
hard
dirt
road
the
plain
is
eighteen
miles
long
by
six
miles
wide
and
except
for
its
scattered
villages
is
almost
entirely
devoted
to
paddy
fields
the
city
itself
includes
about
five
thousand
houses
it
is
exceedingly
picturesque
and
is
remarkable
for
its
long
straight
and
fairly
clean
streets
which
contrast
strongly
with
those
of
the
usual
chinese
town
at
the
west
but
still
within
the
city
walls
is
a
picturesque
wooded
hill
occupied
almost
exclusively
by
temples
we
ourselves
camped
between
two
ponds
in
the
courtyard
of
a
large
and
exceptionally
clean
temple
just
outside
the
south
gate
of
the
city
it
was
the
chinese
new
year
and
wu
told
us
that
for
several
days
at
least
it
would
be
impossible
to
obtain
another
caravan
or
expect
the
natives
to
do
any
work
whatever
it
was
a
very
pleasant
place
in
which
to
stay
although
we
chafed
at
the
enforced
delay
but
we
made
good
use
of
our
time
in
photographing
and
developing
motion
picture
film
collecting
birds
and
making
various
excursions
chinese
new
year
is
always
interesting
to
a
foreigner
and
at
we
saw
many
of
the
customs
attending
its
celebration
it
is
a
time
of
feasting
and
merry
making
and
no
native
if
he
can
possibly
avoid
it
will
work
on
that
day
chinese
families
almost
always
live
under
one
roof
but
should
any
male
member
be
absent
at
this
season
the
circumstances
must
be
exceptional
to
prevent
him
from
returning
to
his
home
it
is
customary
too
for
brides
to
revisit
their
mother
house
at
new
year
on
our
way
to
and
for
several
days
after
leaving
the
city
we
were
continually
passing
young
women
mounted
on
mules
or
horses
and
accompanied
by
servants
returning
to
their
homes
new
clothes
are
a
leading
feature
of
this
season
and
the
dresses
of
the
brides
and
young
matrons
were
usually
of
the
most
unexpected
hues
for
according
to
our
conception
of
color
the
chinese
can
scarcely
be
counted
conspicuous
for
their
good
taste
purple
and
blue
orange
and
red
pink
and
lavender
clash
distressingly
but
are
worn
with
inordinate
pride
these
visits
are
not
an
unalloyed
pleasure
to
the
bride
family

children

to
have
her
take
care
of
them
and
to
have
them
out
of
the
way
when
she
is
not
at
hand
to
look
after
them
and
most
especially
to
have
them
fed
at
the
expense
of
the
family
of
the
maternal
grandmother
for
as
long
a
time
as
possible
in
regions
where
visits
of
this
sort
are
frequent
and
where
there
are
many
daughters
in
a
family
their
constant
raids
on
the
old
home
are
a
source
of
perpetual
terror
to
the
whole
family
and
a
serious
tax
on

in

evil
which

may

during

all
the

gather
before

should
these
be
lacking

among
many
of
the
laboring
classes
a
scroll
with
a
part
of
the
genealogy
is
displayed
and
the
spirits
of
the
departed
are
appeased
and
honored
by
the
burning
of
incense
and
the
mumbling
of
incantations
while
strict
attention
is
paid
to
the
religious
observance
to
the
dead

the
most
punctilious

go
from

are
there
to

the
following
days
are
devoted
to
visits
to

this
continues
an
endless
routine
until
fourteen
days
later
the
feast
of
the

puts
an
end
to
the
epoch
of
national
leisure
the
chinese
are
inveterate
gamblers
and
at

they
turn
feverishly
to
this
form
of
amusement
which
is
almost
their
only
one
but
they
also
have
to
think
seriously
about

to
meet
their
obligations
at

almost
everyone
owes
money
in
china
according
to
the

to
lend
it

at
a
high

at
the

the
national
activity
is
at
fever

it

go
over

no

the
excellent
chinese
habit
of
making
the

there

of

no

village

a

thirty

central
corridor
is
about
thirty

at

followed
the

it
extensively
since
there
was
little
sign
upon
the
floor
at
we
saw
water
buffaloes
for
the
first
time
in
but
found
them
to
be
in
universal
use
farther
to
the
south
and
west
the
huge
brutes
are
as
docile
as
a
kitten
in
the
hands
of
the
smallest
native
child
but
they
do
not
like
foreigners
and
discretion
is
the
better
part
of
valor
where
they
are
concerned
water
buffaloes
are
only
employed
for
work
in
the
rice
fields
but
chinese
cows
are
used
as
burden
bearers
in
this
part
of
the
province
such
caravans
travel
much
more
slowly
than
do
mule
trains
although
the
animals
are
not
loaded
as
heavily
two
or
three
of
the
leading
cows
usually
carry
upon
their
backs
large
bells
hung
in
wooden
frameworks
and
the
music
is
by
no
means
unmelodious
when
heard
at
a
distance
marco
polo
the
great
venetian
traveler
refers
to
as
vochang
his
account
of
a
battle
which
was
fought
in
its
vicinity
in
the
year
between
the
king
of
burma
and
bengal
and
one
of
kublai
khan
generals
is
so
interesting
that
i
am
quoting
it
below
when
the
king
of
mien
burma
and
bangala
bengal
in
india
who
was
powerful
in
the
number
of
his
subjects
in
extent
of
territory
and
in
wealth
heard
that
an
army
of
tartars
had
arrived
at
vochang
he
took
the
resolution
of
advancing
immediately
to
attack
it
in
order
that
by
its
destruction
the
grand
khan
should
be
deterred
from
again
attempting
to
station
a
force
upon
the
borders
of
his
dominions
for
this
purpose
he
assembled
a
very
large
army
including
a
multitude
of
elephants
an
animal
with
which
his
country
abounds
upon
whose
backs
were
placed
battlements
or
castles
of
wood
capable
of
containing
to
the
number
of
twelve
or
sixteen
in
each
with
these
and
a
numerous
army
of
horse
and
foot
he
took
the
road
to
vochang
where
the
grand
khan
army
lay
and
encamping
at
no
great
distance
from
it
intended
to
give
his
troops
a
few
days
of
rest
as
soon
as
the
approach
of
the
king
of
mien
with
so
great
a
force
was
known
to
nestardin
who
commanded
the
troops
of
the
grand
khan
although
a
brave
and
able
officer
he
felt
much
alarmed
not
having
under
his
orders
more
than
twelve
thousand
men
veterans
indeed
and
valiant
soldiers
whereas
the
enemy
had
sixty
thousand
besides
the
elephants
armed
as
has
been
described
he
did
not
however
betray
any
sign
of
apprehension
but
descending
into
the
plain
of
vochang
took
a
position
in
which
his
flank
was
covered
by
a
thick
wood
of
large
trees
whither
in
case
of
a
furious
charge
by
the
elephants
which
his
troops
might
not
be
able
to
sustain
they
could
retire
and
from
thence
in
security
annoy
them
with
their
arrows
upon
the
king
of
mien
learning
that
the
tartars
had
descended
into
the
plain
he
immediately
put
his
army
in
motion
took
up
his
ground
at
the
distance
of
about
a
mile
from
the
enemy
and
made
a
disposition
of
his
force
placing
the
elephants
in
the
front
and
the
cavalry
and
infantry
in
two
extended
wings
in
their
rear
but
leaving
between
them
a
considerable
interval
here
he
took
his
own
station
and
proceeded
to
animate
his
men
and
encourage
them
to
fight
valiantly
assuring
them
of
victory
as
well
from
the
superiority
of
their
numbers
being
four
to
one
as
from
their
formidable
body
of
armed
elephants
whose
shock
the
enemy
who
had
never
before
been
engaged
with
such
combatants
could
by
no
means
resist
then
giving
orders
for
sounding
a
prodigious
number
of
warlike
instruments
he
advanced
boldly
with
his
whole
army
towards
that
of
the
tartars
which
remained
firm
making
no
movement
but
suffering
them
to
approach
their
entrenchments
they
then
rushed
out
with
great
spirit
and
the
utmost
eagerness
to
engage
but
it
was
soon
found
that
the
tartar
horses
unused
to
the
sight
of
such
huge
animals
with
their
castles
were
terrified
and
by
wheeling
about
endeavored
to
fly
nor
could
their
riders
by
any
exertions
restrain
them
whilst
the
king
with
the
whole
of
his
forces
was
every
moment
gaining
ground
as
soon
as
the
prudent
commander
perceived
this
unexpected
disorder
without
losing
his
presence
of
mind
he
instantly
adopted
the
measure
of
ordering
his
men
to
dismount
and
their
horses
to
be
taken
into
the
wood
where
they
were
fastened
to
the
trees
when
dismounted
the
men
without
loss
of
time
advanced
on
foot
towards
the
line
of
elephants
and
commenced
a
brisk
discharge
of
arrows
whilst
on
the
other
side
those
who
were
stationed
in
the
castles
and
the
rest
of
the
king
army
shot
volleys
in
return
with
great
activity
but
their
arrows
did
not
make
the
same
impression
as
those
of
the
tartars
whose
bows
were
drawn
with
a
stronger
arm
so
incessant
were
the
discharges
of
the
latter
and
all
their
weapons
according
to
the
instructions
of
their
commander
being
directed
against
the
elephants
these
were
soon
covered
with
arrows
and
suddenly
giving
way
fell
back
upon
their
own
people
in
the
rear
who
were
thereby
thrown
into
confusion
it
soon
became
impossible
for
their
drivers
to
manage
them
either
by
force
or
address
smarting
under
the
pain
of
their
wounds
and
terrified
by
the
shouting
of
the
assailants
they
were
no
longer
governable
but
without
guidance
or
control
ran
about
in
all
directions
until
at
length
impelled
by
rage
and
fear
they
rushed
into
a
part
of
the
wood
not
occupied
by
the
tartars
the
consequence
of
this
was
that
from
the
closeness
of
the
branches
of
large
trees
they
broke
with
loud
crashes
the
battlements
or
castles
that
were
upon
their
backs
and
involved
in
the
destruction
those
who
sat
upon
them
upon
seeing
the
rout
of
the
elephants
the
tartars
acquired
fresh
courage
and
filing
off
by
detachments
with
perfect
order
and
regularity
they
remounted
their
horses
and
joined
their
several
divisions
when
a
sanguinary
and
dreadful
combat
was
renewed
on
the
part
of
the
king
troops
there
was
no
want
of
valor
and
he
himself
went
amongst
the
ranks
entreating
them
to
stand
firm
and
not
to
be
alarmed
by
the
accident
that
had
befallen
the
elephants
but
the
tartars
by
their
consummate
skill
in
archery
were
too
powerful
for
them
and
galled
them
the
more
exceedingly
from
their
not
being
provided
with
such
armor
as
was
worn
by
the
former
the
arrows
having
been
expended
on
both
sides
the
men
grasped
their
swords
and
iron
maces
and
violently
encountered
each
other
then
in
an
instant
were
to
be
seen
many
horrible
wounds
limbs
dismembered
and
multitudes
falling
to
the
ground
maimed
and
dying
with
such
effusion
of
blood
as
was
dreadful
to
behold
so
great
also
was
the
clangor
of
arms
and
such
the
shoutings
and
the
shrieks
that
the
noise
seemed
to
ascend
to
the
skies
the
king
of
mien
acting
as
became
a
valiant
chief
was
present
wherever
the
greatest
danger
appeared
animating
his
soldiers
and
beseeching
them
to
maintain
their
ground
with
resolution
he
ordered
fresh
squadrons
from
the
reserve
to
advance
to
the
support
of
those
that
were
exhausted
but
perceiving
at
length
that
it
was
impossible
any
longer
to
sustain
the
conflict
or
to
withstand
the
impetuosity
of
the
tartars
the
greater
part
of
his
troops
being
either
killed
or
wounded
and
all
the
field
covered
with
the
carcasses
of
men
and
horses
whilst
those
who
survived
were
beginning
to
give
way
he
also
found
himself
compelled
to
take
to
flight
with
the
wreck
of
his
army
numbers
of
whom
were
afterwards
slain
in
the
pursuit
the
tartars
having
collected
their
force
after
the
slaughter
of
the
enemy
returned
towards
the
wood
into
which
the
elephants
had
fled
for
shelter
in
order
to
take
possession
of
them
where
they
found
that
the
men
who
had
escaped
from
the
overthrow
were
employed
in
cutting
down
trees
and
barricading
the
passages
with
the
intent
of
defending
themselves
but
their
ramparts
were
soon
demolished
by
the
tartars
who
slew
many
of
them
and
with
the
assistance
of
the
persons
accustomed
to
the
management
of
the
elephants
they
possessed
themselves
of
these
to
the
number
of
two
hundred
or
more
from
the
period
of
this
battle
the
grand
khan
has
always
chosen
to
employ
elephants
in
his
armies
which
before
that
time
he
had
not
done
the
consequences
of
the
victory
were
that
he
acquired
possession
of
the
whole
of
the
territories
of
the
king
of
bangala
and
mien
and
annexed
them
to
his
dominions

traveling
toward
the
tropics
we
left
with
no
regret
on
monday
january
our
stay
there
would
have
been
exceedingly
pleasant
under
ordinary
conditions
but
it
was
impossible
not
to
chafe
at
the
delay
occasioned
by
the
caravan
traveling
southward
for
two
days
over
bare
brown
their
monotony
unrelieved
except
by
groves
of
planted
pine
and
fir
trees
we
descended
abruptly
into
the
great
subtropical
valley
at
mile
after
mile
this
fertile
plain
stretches
away
in
a
succession
of
rice
paddys
and
fields
of
sugar
cane
interspersed
with
patches
of
graceful
bamboo
their
summits
drooping
like
enormous
clusters
of
ostrich
plumes
the
air
is
warm
and
fragrant
and
the
change
from
the
surrounding
hills
is
delightful
however
we
were
disappointed
in
the
shooting
for
although
it
appeared
to
be
an
ideal
place
for
ducks
and
other
water
birds
we
killed
only
five
teal
and
the
great
ponds
were
almost
devoid
of
bird
life
even
herons
so
abundant
in
the
north
were
conspicuous
by
their
absence
and
we
saw
no
sheldrakes
geese
or
mallards
at
we
camped
in
a
beautiful
temple
yard
on
the
outskirts
of
the
town
and
with
wu
i
returned
to
the
village
to
inquire
about
shooting
places
we
seated
ourselves
in
the
first
open
tea
house
and
within
ten
minutes
more
than
a
hundred
natives
had
filled
the
room
overflowed
through
the
door
and
windows
and
formed
a
mass
of
pushing
crowding
bodies
which
completely
blocked
the
street
outside
it
was
a
simple
way
of
getting
all
the
village
together
and
wu
questioned
everyone
who
looked
intelligent
we
learned
that
shooting
was
to
be
found
near
five
travel
south
and
we
returned
to
the
temple
just
in
time
to
receive
a
visit
from
the
resident
mandarin
he
was
a
intellectual
man
with
charming
manners
and
one
of
the
most
delightful
gentlemen
whom
we
met
in
china
during
his
visit
and
until
dinner
was
over
and
we
had
retired
to
our
tents
hundreds
of
men
women
and
children
crowded
into
the
temple
yard
to
gaze
curiously
at
us
after
the
gates
had
been
closed
they
climbed
the
walls
and
sat
upon
the
tiles
like
a
flock
of
crows
their
curiosity
was
insatiable
but
not
unfriendly
and
nowhere
throughout
our
expedition
did
we
find
such
extraordinary
interest
in
our
affairs
as
was
manifested
by
the
people
in
this
immediate
region
they
were
largely
chinese
and
most
of
them
must
have
met
foreigners
before
yet
their
curiosity
was
much
greater
than
that
of
any
natives
whom
we
knew
were
seeing
white
persons
for
the
first
time
just
before
camping
the
next
day
we
passed
through
a
large
village
where
we
were
given
a
most
flattering
reception
we
had
stopped
to
do
some
shooting
and
were
a
considerable
distance
behind
the
caravan
the
must
have
announced
our
coming
for
the
populace
was
out
to
greet
us
and
lined
the
streets
three
deep
it
was
a
veritable
triumphal
entry
and
crowds
of
men
and
children
followed
us
for
half
a
mile
outside
the
town
running
beside
our
horses
and
staring
with
eyes

young

on
the
second
day
from
we
climbed
a
high
mountain
and
wound
down
a
sharp
descent
for
about
feet
into
a
valley
only
feet
above
sea
level
we
had
been
cold
all
day
on
the
ridges
exposed
to
a
biting
wind
and
had
bundled
ourselves
into
sweaters
and
coats
over
flannel
shirts
after
going
down
about
feet
we
tied
our
coats
to
the
saddle
pockets
on
the
second
thousand
stripped
off
the
sweaters
and
for
the
remainder
of
the
descent
rode
with
sleeves
rolled
up
and
shirts
open
at
the
throat
we
had
come
from
into
summer
in
two
hours
and
the
change
was
most
startling
it
was
as
though
we
had
suddenly
ridden
into
an
artificially
heated
building
like
the
rooms
for
tropical
plants
at
botanical
gardens
our
camp
was
on
a
flat
plain
just
above
the
river
where
we
had
a
splendid
view
of
the
wide
valley
which
was
like
the
bottom
of
a
well
with
high
mountains
rising
abruptly
on
all
sides
it
was
a
place
of
strange
contrasts
the
bushes
and
trees
were
in
full
green
foliage
but
the
grass
and
paddy
fields
were
dry
and
brown
as
in
the
thick
trees
at
the
base
of
the
hills
were
literally
alive
with
doves
but
there
were
few
mammal
runways
and
our
traps
yielded
no
results
that
night
a
muntjac
the
first
we
had
heard
barked
hoarsely
behind
the
tents
the
soldier
who
accompanied
us
from
delivered
his
official
dispatch
at
the
village
which
lies
farther
down
the
valley
the
magistrate
who
proved
to
be
a
shan
native
arrived
soon
after
with
ten
or
twelve
men
and
we
discovered
that
there
was
but
one
man
in
the
village
who
spoke
chinese
the
magistrate
at
by
no
means
wished
to
have
the
responsibility
of
our
safety
thrust
upon
him
and
consequently
assured
us
that
there
were
neither
game
nor
hunters
in
this
village
although
his
anxiety
to
be
rid
of
us
was
apparent
he
was
probably
telling
the
truth
for
the
valley
is
so
highly
cultivated
rice
and
the
cover
on
the
so
limited
that
it
is
doubtful
if
much
game
remains
in
the
morning
the
entire
valley
was
filled
with
a
dense
white
fog
but
we
climbed
out
of
it
almost
immediately
and
by
noon
were
back
again
in
winter
on
the
summits
of
the
ridges
the
country
through
which
we
passed
to
was
similar
to
that
which
had
oppressed
us
during
the
preceding
week
cultivated
valleys
between
high
barren
mountains
relieved
here
and
there
by
scattered
groves
of
planted
fir
trees
it
was
a
region
utterly
hopeless
from
a
naturalist
standpoint
and
when
we
arrived
at
a
large
town
near
we
were
discouraged
during
almost
a
month
of
travel
we
had
been
guided
by
native
information
which
without
exception
had
proved
worthless
it
seemed
useless
to
rely
upon
it
further
and
yet
there
was
no
other
alternative
for
none
of
the
foreigners
whom
we
had
met
in
knew
anything
about
this
part
of
the
province
we
were
certain
to
reach
a
tropical
region
farther
south
and
the
fact
that
there
were
a
few
sambur
skins
for
sale
in
the
market
offered
slight
encouragement
these
were
said
to
come
from
a
village
called
a
little
more
far
to
the
tune
of
four
or
five
days
travel
over
on
the
burma
frontier
with
gloom
in
our
hearts
which
matched
that
of
the
weather
we
left
in
a
pouring
rain
on
february
to
slip
and
splash
southward
through
veritable
rivers
of
mud
for
two
long
marches
in
the
afternoon
of
the
second
day
the
country
suddenly
changed
the
trail
led
through
a
wide
grassy
valley
bordered
by
heavily
forested
hills
into
a
deep
ravine
along
the
banks
of
a
clear
stream
the
earth
was
soft
and
damp
and
the
logs
and
dense
vegetation
made
ideal
conditions
for
small
mammalian
life
we
rode
happily
up
the
ravine
and
stood
in
a
rocky
gateway
at
the
right
a
mountain
rose
out
of
a
tangle
of
luxuriant
vegetation
to
the
left
wave
after
wave
of
magnificent
forested
ridges
lost
themselves
in
the
low
hung
clouds
at
our
feet
lay
a
beautiful
valley
filled
with
stately
trees
which
spread
into
a
thick
green
canopy
overhead
we
camped
in
a
clearing
just
at
the
edge
of
the
forest
while
the
tents
were
being
pitched
i
set
a
line
of
traps
along
the
base
of
the
opposite
mountain
and
found
a
runway
under
almost
every
log
about
eight
i
ran
my
traps
and
with
the
aid
of
a
lantern
stumbled
about
in
the
bushes
and
high
grass
over
logs
and
into
holes
when
i
emptied
my
pockets
there
were
fifteen
mice
rats
shrews
and
voles
representing
seven
species
and
new
to
our
heller
brought
in
eight
specimens
and
added
two
new
species
we
forthwith
decided
to
stay
right
where
we
were
until
this
gold
mine
had
been
exhausted
in
the
morning
our
traps
were
full
of
mammals
and
were
laid
out
on
the
table
ready
for
skinning
the
length
tail
hind
foot
and
ear
of
each
specimen
was
first
carefully
measured
in
millimeters
and
recorded
in
the
field
catalogue
and
upon
a
printed
label
bearing
our
serial
number
then
an
incision
was
made
in
the
belly
the
skin
stripped
off
poisoned
with
arsenic
stuffed
with
cotton
and
sewed
up
the
animal
was
then
pinned
in
position
by
the
feet
nose
and
tail
in
a
shallow
wooden
tray
which
fitted
in
the
collecting
trunk
the
specimens
were
put
in
the
sun
on
every
bright
day
until
they
were
thoroughly
dry
and
could
be
wrapped
in
cotton
and
packed
in
trunks
or
boxes
we
have
found
that
the
regulation
army
fiber
trunk
makes
an
ideal
collecting
case
it
measures
thirty
inches
long
by
thirteen
deep
and
sixteen
inches
wide
and
will
remain
quite
dry
in
an
ordinary
rain
but
of
course
must
not
be
allowed
to
stand
in
water
the
skulls
of
all
specimens
and
the
skeletons
of
some
are
numbered
like
the
skin
strung
upon
a
wire
and
dried
in
the
sun
also
individuals
of
every
species
are
injected
and
preserved
in
formalin
for
future
anatomical
study
larger
specimens
are
always
salted
and
dried
as
soon
as
the
skin
has
been
removed
and
cleaned
of
flesh
and
fat
salt
is
rubbed
into
every
part
of
it
and
the
hide
rolled
up
in
the
morning
it
is
unwrapped
the
water
which
has
been
extracted
by
the
salt
poured
off
and
the
skin
hung
over
a
rope
or
a
tree
branch
to
dry
if
it
is
not
too
hot
and
the
air
is
dry
the
skin
may
be
kept
in
the
shade
to
good
advantage
but
under
ordinary
field
conditions
it
should
be
placed
in
the
sun
before
it
becomes
too
hard
the
hide
is
rolled
or
folded
into
a
convenient
package
hair
side
in
tied
into
shape
and
allowed
to
become
bone
dry
in
this
condition
it
will
keep
indefinitely
but
requires
constant
watching
for
the
salt
absorbs
moisture
from
the
air
and
alternate
wetting
and
drying
is
fatal
we
soon
trained
two
of
our
chinese
boys
to
skin
both
large
and
small
animals
and
they
became
quite
expert
they
required
constant
watching
however
and
after
each
hide
had
been
salted
either
heller
or
i
examined
it
to
make
sure
that
it
was
properly
treated
on
our
first
day
in
camp
we
sent
for
natives
to
the
village
of
ten
distant
the
men
assured
us
that
there
were
sambur
serow
and
muntjac
in
the
neighborhood
and
they
agreed
to
hunt
they
had
no
dogs
and
were
armed
with
crossbows
antiquated
guns
and
bows
and
arrows
but
they
showed
us
the
skins
of
two
sambur
in
proof
of
their
ability
to
secure
game
like
most
of
the
other
natives
with
the
exception
of
the
mosos
on
the
snow
mountain
these
men
had
no
definite
plan
in
hunting
the
first
day
i
went
out
with
them
they
indicated
that
we
were
to
drive
a
hill
not
far
from
camp
without
giving
me
an
opportunity
to
reach
a
position
in
front
of
them
they
began
to
work
up
the
hill
and
i
had
a
fleeting
glimpse
of
a
sambur
silhouetted
against
the
sky
as
it
dashed
over
the
summit
two
days
later
while
i
was
out
with
ten
other
men
who
had
a
fairly
good
pack
of
dogs
the
first
party
succeeded
in
killing
a
female
sambur
the
animal
weighed
at
least
five
hundred
pounds
but
they
brought
it
to
our
camp
and
we
purchased
the
skin
for
ten
south
of
the
money
of
the
region
like
all
of
for
some
distance
from
the
burma
frontier
is
the
indian
which
equals
cents
american
gold
in
that
part
of
the
province
adjoining
tonking
french
money
is
current
my
journal
of
february
tells
of
our
life
at
this
camp
which
we
called
good
hope
the
weather
is
delightful
for
the
sun
is
just
warm
enough
for
comfort
and
the
nights
are
clear
and
cold
how
we
do
sleep
it
seems
hardly
an
hour
from
the
time
we
go
to
bed
until
we
hear
wu
rousing
the
servants
and
the
crackle
of
the
outside
the
tent
we
half
dress
in
our
sleeping
bags
and
with
chattering
teeth
dash
for
the
fire
to
lace
our
high
boots
in
its
comfortable
warmth
after
breakfast
when
it
is
full
daylight
my
wife
and
i
inspect
the
traps
the
ground
is
white
with
frost
and
the
trees
and
bushes
are
dressed
in
silver
every
trap
holds
an
individual
interest
and
we
follow
the
line
through
the
forest
resetting
some
and
finding
new
mammals
in
others
yvette
has
conquered
her
feminine
repugnance
far
enough
to
remove
shrews
or
mice
from
the
traps
by
releasing
the
spring
and
dropping
them
on
to
a
broad
green
leaf
but
she
never
touches
them
we
go
back
to
meet
the
hunters
and
while
i
am
away
with
the
men
the
lady
of
the
camp
works
at
her
photography
i
return
in
the
late
afternoon
and
after
tea
we
wander
through
the
woods
together
it
is
the
most
delightful
part
of
the
day
when
the
sun
goes
down
and
the
shadows
lengthen
we
sit
on
a
log
in
a
small
clearing
where
we
can
watch
the
upper
branches
of
a
splendid
tree
it
is
the
home
of
a
great
colony
of
squirrels
subsp
and
after
a
few
moments
of
silence
we
see
a
flash
of
brown
along
a
branch
my
gun
roars
out
and
there
is
a
thud
upon
the
ground
yvette
runs
to
find
the
animal
and
ere
the
echoes
have
died
away
in
the
forest
the
gun
bangs
again
we
have
already
shot
a
dozen
squirrels
from
this
tree
and
yet
more
are
there
sometimes
a
tiny
striped
chipmunk
subsp
will
appear
on
the
lower
branches
searching
the
bark
for
grubs
and
after
he
falls
we
have
a
long
hunt
to
find
him
in
the
brown
leaves
when
it
is
too
dark
to
see
the
squirrels
we
wander
slowly
back
to
camp
and
eat
a
dinner
of
delicious
broiled
deer
steak
in
front
of
the
fire
over
the
coffee
we
smoke
and
talk
of
the
day
hunting
until
it
is
time
to
run
the
traps
of
all
the
work
we
enjoy
this
most
with
lanterns
and
a
gun
we
pick
our
way
among
the
trees
until
we
strike
the
trail
along
which
the
traps
are
set
on
the
soft
ground
our
feet
are
noiseless
and
extinguishing
the
lanterns
we
sit
on
a
log
to
listen
to
the
night
sounds
the
woods
are
full
of
life
almost
beside
us
there
is
a
patter
of
tiny
feet
and
a
scurry
among
the
dry
leaves
a
muntjac
barks
hoarsely
on
the
opposite
hillside
and
a
fox
yelps
behind
us
in
the
forest
suddenly
there
is
a
sharp
snap
a
muffled
squeal
and
a
trap
a
few
yards
away
has
done
its
work
even
in
the
tree
tops
the
night
life
is
active
dead
twigs
drop
to
the
ground
with
an
unnatural
noise
and
owls
show
black
against
the
sky
as
they
flit
across
an
opening
in
the
branches
we
light
the
lanterns
again
and
pass
down
the
trail
into
a
cuplike
hollow
here
there
are
a
dozen
traps
and
already
half
of
them
are
full
in
one
is
a
tiny
brown
shrew
caught
by
the
tail
as
he
ran
across
the
trap
another
holds
a
veritable
treasure
and
at
my
exclamation
of
delight
yvette
runs
up
excitedly
it
is
a
rare
insectivore
of
the
genus
and
possibly
a
species
new
to
science
we
examine
it
beside
the
lantern
wrap
it
carefully
in
paper
and
drop
it
into
a
pocket
by
itself
the
next
bit
of
cotton
clings
to
a
bush
above
a
mossy
log
the
trap
is
gone
and
for
ten
minutes
we
hunt
carefully
over
every
inch
of
ground
finally
my
wife
discovers
it
fifteen
feet
away
and
stifles
a
scream
for
in
it
caught
by
the
neck
and
still
alive
is
a
huge
rat
nearly
two
feet
long
it
too
is
a
species
which
may
prove
new
when
the
last
trap
has
been
examined
we
follow
the
trail
to
the
edge
of
the
forest
and
into
the
clearing
where
the
tents
glow
in
the
darkness
like
great
yellow
pumpkins
ours
is
delightfully
warmed
by
the
charcoal
brazier
and
stretched
comfortably
on
the
beds
we
write
our
daily
records
or
read
dickens
for
half
an
hour
it
is
with
a
feeling
of
great
contentment
that
we
slip
down
into
the
sleeping
bags
and
blow
out
the
candles
leaving
the
tent
filled
with
the
soft
glow
of
the
moonlight
chapter
xxviii
a
village
of
many
tongues
during
the
eight
days
in
which
we
remained
at
the
good
hope
camp
two
hundred
specimens
comprising
species
were
added
to
our
collection
although
the
altitude
was
still
feet
the
flora
was
quite
unlike
that
of
any
region
in
which
we
had
previously
collected
and
that
undoubtedly
was
responsible
for
the
complete
change
of
fauna
we
were
on
the
very
edge
of
the
tropical
belt
which
stretches
along
the
tonking
and
burma
frontiers
in
the
extreme
south
and
west
of
the
province
it
was
already
and
if
we
were
to
work
in
the
valleys
below
feet
it
was
high
time
we
were
on
the
way
southward
the
information
which
we
had
obtained
near
had
been
supplemented
by
the
natives
of
and
we
decided
to
go
to
as
soon
as
possible
the
first
march
was
long
and
uneventful
but
at
its
end
from
the
summit
of
a
high
ridge
we
could
see
a
wide
valley
which
we
reached
in
the
early
morning
of
the
second
day
the
narrow
mountain
trail
abruptly
left
us
on
a
jutting
promontory
and
wandered
uncertainly
down
a
steep
ravine
to
lose
itself
in
a
veritable
forest
of
tree
ferns
and
sword
grass
the
slanting
rays
of
the
sun
drew
long
golden
paths
into
the
mysterious
depths
of
the
valley
to
the
right
a
giant
sentinel
peak
of
granite
rose
gaunt
and
naked
from
out
the
enveloping
sea
of
green
which
swelled
away
to
the
left
in
huge
ascending
billows
we
rested
in
our
saddles
until
the
faint
tinkle
of
the
bell
on
the
leading
mule
announced
the
approach
of
the
caravan
and
then
we
picked
our
way
slowly
down
the
steep
trail
between
walls
of
tangled
vegetation
in
an
hour
we
were
breathing
the
moist
warm
air
of
the
tropics
and
riding
across
a
wide
valley
as
level
as
a
floor
the
long
stretches
of
rank
grass
far
higher
than
our
heads
were
broken
by
groves
of
feathery
bamboos
banana
palms
and
splendid
trees
interlaced
with
tangled
vines
near
the
base
of
the
mountains
a
shan
village
nestled
into
the
grass
the
bamboo
houses
sheltered
by
trees
and
bushes
were
roofed
in
the
shape
of
an
overturned
boat
with
thatch
and
the
single
street
was
wide
and
clean
could
this
really
be
china
verily
it
was
a
different
china
from
that
we
had
seen
before
it
might
be
burma
india
java
but
never
china
before
the
door
of
a
tiny
house
sat
a
woman
spinning
a
real
priscilla
somewhat
strange
in
dress
to
be
sure
and
with
a
mouth
streaked
with
betel
nut
but
priscilla
just
the
same
and
in
his
proper
place
beside
her
stood
john
alden
a
pair
of
loose
baggy
trousers
hitched
far
up
over
one
leg
to
show
the
intricate
tattoo
designs
beneath
a
short
coat
and
a
white
turban
completed
john
attire
but
he
grasped
a
gun
almost
as
ancient
in
design
as
that
of
his
pilgrim
fathers
priscilla
kept
her
eyes
upon
the
spinning
wheel
but
john
gaze
could
by
no
stretch
of
imagination
be
called
ardent
even
before
we
appeared
around
a
corner
of
the
house
and
the
pretty
picture
resolved
into
its
rightful
components
a
surprised
but
not
unlovely
shan
girl
and
a
native
who
stared
with
wide
brown
eyes
and
open
mouth
at
what
must
have
seemed
to
him
the
fancy
of
a
disordered
brain
illustration
a
shan
village
illustration
a
shan
woman
spinning
for
into
his
village
filled
with
immemorial
peace
and
quiet
where
every
day
was
exactly
like
the
day
before
had
suddenly
ridden
two
big
men
with
white
skins
and
blue
eyes
and
a
little
one
with
lots
of
hair
beneath
a
broad
sun
helmet
and
almost
immediately
the
little
one
had
jumped
from
the
horse
and
pointed
a
black
box
with
a
shiny
front
at
him
and
his
priscilla
at
once
but
without
loss
of
dignity
priscilla
vanished
into
the
house
but
john
alden
stood
his
ground
for
a
beautiful
new
tin
can
had
been
thrust
into
his
hand
and
before
he
had
really
discovered
what
it
was
the
little
person
had
smiled
at
him
and
turned
her
attention
to
the
charming
street
of
his
village
there
the
great
water
buffaloes
lazily
chewed
their
cuds
standing
guard
over
the
tiny
natives
who
played
trustingly
with
the
calves
almost
beneath
their
feet
such
was
our
invasion
of
the
first
shan
village
we
had
ever
seen
and
regretfully
we
rode
away
across
the
plain
between
the
walls
of
waving
grass
toward
the
river
two
canoes
each
dug
out
of
a
single
log
and
tightly
bound
together
formed
the
ferry
but
the
packs
were
soon
across
the
muddy
stream
and
the
mules
were
made
to
swim
to
the
other
bank
shortly
after
leaving
the
ferry
we
emerged
from
the
vast
stretches
of
rank
grass
on
to
the
open
rice
paddys
which
stretched
away
in
a
gently
undulating
plain
from
the
river
to
the
mountains
strangely
enough
we
saw
no
ducks
or
geese
but
three
great
flocks
of
cranes
probably
rose
from
the
fields
and
wheeled
in
spirals
above
our
heads
until
they
were
lost
in
the
blue
depths
of
the
sky
away
in
the
distance
we
saw
a
wooded
knoll
with
a
few
wisps
of
smoke
curling
above
its
summit
but
not
until
we
were
there
did
we
realize
that
its
beautiful
trees
sheltered
the
thatched
roofs
of
but
this
was
only
the
section
of
the
village
and
below
the
knoll
on
the
opposite
side
of
a
shallow
stream
lay
the
shops
and
markets
we
camped
on
a
dry
rice
dyke
where
a
fringe
of
jungle
separated
us
from
the
nearest
house
as
soon
as
the
tents
were
up
i
announced
our
coming
to
the
mandarin
and
requested
an
interview
at
five
wu
and
i
found
the
to
be
a
large
house
delightfully
cool
and
exhibiting
several
foreign
articles
which
evinced
its
proximity
to
burma
we
were
received
by
a
suave
chinese
secretary
who
shortly
introduced
the
mandarin
a
young
shan
not
more
than
twenty
years
old
who
only
recently
had
succeeded
his
late
father
as
chief
of
the
village
the
boy
was
dressed
in
an
exceedingly
long
frock
coat
rather
green
and
frayed
about
the
elbows
which
in
combination
with
his
otherwise
typical
native
dress
gave
him
a
most
extraordinary
appearance
we
soon
discovered
that
the
chinese
secretary
who
did
all
the
talking
was
the
power
behind
the
throne
he
accepted
my
gift
of
a
package
of
tea
with
great
pleasure
but
the
information
about
hunting
localities
for
which
we
asked
was
not
forthcoming
he
first
said
that
he
knew
of
a
place
where
there
were
tiger
and
leopard
but
that
he
did
not
dare
to
reveal
it
to
us
for
we
might
be
killed
by
the
wild
animals
and
he
would
be
responsible
for
our
deaths
bringing
to
his
attention
the
fact
that
tigers
had
never
been
recorded
from
the
region
did
not
impress
him
in
the
slightest
it
did
tend
to
send
him
off
on
another
track
however
and
he
next
remarked
that
if
he
sent
us
to
a
place
where
the
hunting
was
disappointing
we
probably
would
report
him
to
the
district
mandarin
assurances
to
the
contrary
had
no
effect
it
was
perfectly
evident
that
he
wished
only
to
get
us
out
of
his
district
and
thus
relieve
himself
of
the
responsibility
of
our
safety
during
the
conversation
which
lasted
more
than
an
hour
the
young
shan
was
not
consulted
and
did
not
speak
a
word
he
sat
stolidly
in
his
chair
hardly
winking
and
except
for
the
constant
supply
of
cigarettes
which
passed
between
his
fingers
there
was
no
evidence
that
he
even
breathed
the
interview
closed
with
assurances
from
the
chinaman
that
he
would
make
inquiries
concerning
hunting
grounds
and
communicate
with
us
in
the
morning
we
returned
to
camp
and
half
an
hour
later
a
party
of
natives
arrived
from
the
bearing
about
one
hundred
pounds
of
rice
a
sack
of
potatoes
two
dozen
eggs
three
chickens
and
a
great
bundle
of
fire
wood
these
were
deposited
in
front
of
our
tent
as
gifts
from
the
mandarin
we
were
at
a
loss
to
account
for
such
generosity
until
wu
explained
that
whenever
a
high
official
visited
a
village
it
was
customary
for
the
mandarin
to
supply
his
entire
party
with
food
during
their
stay
it
would
be
quite
polite
to
send
back
all
except
a
few
articles
however
for
the
supplies
were
levied
from
the
inhabitants
of
the
town
we
kept
the
eggs
and
chickens
giving
the
runners
considerably
more
than
their
value
in
money
and
they
gratefully
returned
with
the
rice
and
potatoes
on
the
hill
high
above
our
camp
was
a
large
shan
buddhist
monastery
bamboo
walled
and
thatched
with
straw
and
at
sunset
and
daybreak
a
musical
chant
of
childish
voices
floated
down
to
us
in
the
valley
all
day
long
tiny
figures
squatted
on
the
mud
walls
about
the
temple
like
a
flock
of
birds
peering
at
us
with
bright
round
eyes
they
were
wild
as
hawks
these
little
priests
and
although
they
sometimes
left
the
shelter
of
their
temple
walls
they
never
ventured
below
the
bushy
hedge
about
our
rice
field
in
the
village
we
saw
them
often
wandering
about
the
streets
or
sitting
in
yellow
groups
beneath
the
giant
trees
which
threw
a
welcome
shade
over
almost
every
house
they
were
not
all
children
and
finely
built
youths
or
men
so
old
that
they
seemed
like
wrinkled
bits
of
lemon
peel
passed
to
and
fro
to
the
temple
on
the
hill
there
is
no
dearth
of
priests
for
every
family
in
the
village
with
male
children
is
required
to
send
at
least
one
boy
to
live
a
part
of
his
life
under
the
tutelage
of
the
church
he
must
remain
three
years
and
longer
if
he
wishes
the
priests
are
fed
by
the
monastery
and
their
clothing
is
not
an
important
item
of
expenditure
as
it
consists
merely
of
a
straw
hat
and
a
yellow
robe
they
lead
a
lazy
worthless
life
and
from
their
sojourn
in
religious
circles
they
learn
only
indolence
and
idleness
the
day
following
our
arrival
in
the
weekly
market
was
held
and
when
wu
and
i
crossed
the
little
stream
to
the
business
part
of
the
village
we
found
ourselves
in
the
midst
of
the
most
picturesque
crowd
of
natives
it
has
ever
been
my
fortune
to
see
it
was
a
group
flashing
with
color
and
every
individual
a
study
for
an
artist
there
were
chinese
shans
with
tattooed
legs
turbans
of
pink
or
white
and
burmans
dressed
in
brilliant
purple
or
green
las
lisos
palaungs
was
and
kachins
in
black
and
red
strung
about
with
beads
or
shells
long
swords
hung
from
the
shoulders
of
those
who
did
not
carry
a
spear
or
gun
and
the
hilts
of
wicked
looking
daggers
peeped
from
beneath
their
sashes
every
man
carried
a
weapon
ready
for
instant
use
nine
tribes
were
present
in
the
market
that
day
and
almost
as
many
languages
were
being
spoken
it
was
a
veritable
babel
and
half
the
trading
was
done
by
signs
the
narrow
street
was
choked
with
goods
of
every
kind
spread
out
upon
the
ground
fruit
rice
cloth
nails
knives
swords
hats
sandals
skins
horns
baskets
mats
crossbows
arrows
pottery
tea
opium
and
scores
of
other
articles
for
food
or
household
use
dozens
of
natives
were
arriving
and
departing
bringing
new
goods
or
packing
up
their
purchases
under
open
thatched
pavilions
were
silent
groups
of
men
gambling
with
cash
or
silver
and
in
the
tea
houses
natives
lay
stretched
upon
the
couches
rolling
pills
of
opium
and
oblivious
to
the
constant
stream
of
it
was
a
picturesque
ever
changing
group
a
kaleidoscopic
mass
of
life
and
color
where
chinese
from
civilized
canton
drank
and
gambled
and
smoked
with
wild
natives
from
the
hills
or
from
the
depths
of
jungles
after
one
glimpse
of
the
picture
in
the
market
i
dashed
back
to
camp
to
bring
the
lady
of
the
camera
on
the
way
i
met
her
hot
and
breathless
half
coaxing
half
driving
three
bewildered
young
priests
resplendent
in
yellow
robes
all
the
morning
she
had
been
trying
vainly
to
photograph
a
priest
and
had
discovered
these
splendid
fellows
when
all
her
color
plates
had
been
exposed
she
might
have
succeeded
in
bringing
them
to
camp
had
i
not
arrived
but
they
suddenly
lost
courage
and
rushed
away
with
averted
faces
when
the
plate
holders
were
all
reloaded
we
hurried
back
to
the
market
followed
by
two
coolies
with
the
cameras
leaving
yvette
to
do
her
work
alone
i
set
up
the
cinematograph
wu
was
with
me
and
in
less
than
a
minute
the
narrow
space
in
front
of
us
was
packed
with
a
seething
mass
of
natives
it
was
impossible
to
take
a
street
scene
for
the
street
had
suddenly
disappeared
making
a
virtue
of
necessity
i
focused
the
camera
on
the
irregular
line
of
heads
and
swung
it
back
and
forth
registering
a
variety
of
facial
expressions
which
it
would
be
hard
to
duplicate
for
some
time
it
was
impossible
to
bribe
the
natives
to
stand
even
for
a
moment
but
after
one
or
two
had
conquered
their
fear
and
been
liberally
rewarded
there
was
a
rush
for
places
wu
asked
several
of
the
natives
who
could
speak
chinese
if
they
knew
what
we
were
doing
but
they
all
shook
their
heads
none
of
them
had
ever
seen
a
camera
or
a
photograph
the
kachin
women
were
the
most
picturesque
of
all
the
tribes
as
well
as
the
most
difficult
to
photograph
yvette
was
not
able
to
get
them
at
all
and
i
could
do
so
only
by
strategy
when
wu
discovered
two
or
three
squatting
near
their
baskets
on
the
ground
i
moved
slowly
up
behind
them
keeping
in
the
center
of
the
crowd
after
the
movie
camera
was
in
position
wu
suddenly
shooed
back
the
spectators
and
before
the
women
realized
what
was
happening
they
were
registered
on
or
thirty
feet
of
film
illustration
a
kachin
woman
in
the
market
at
illustration
one
of
our
shan
hunters
with
two
yellow
gibbons
one
of
the
kachin
men
who
had
drunk
too
much
suddenly
became
belligerent
when
i
pointed
the
camera
in
his
direction
and
rushed
at
me
with
a
drawn
knife
i
swung
for
his
jaw
with
my
right
fist
and
he
went
down
in
a
heap
he
was
more
surprised
than
hurt
i
imagine
but
it
took
all
of
the
fight
out
of
him
for
he
received
no
sympathy
from
the
spectators
poor
yvette
had
a
difficult
time
with
her
camera
operations
and
a
less
determined
person
would
have
given
up
in
despair
the
natives
were
so
shy
and
suspicious
that
it
was
impossible
to
bribe
them
to
stand
for
a
second
and
it
was
only
after
three
hours
of
aggravating
work
in
the
stifling
heat
and
dust
that
she
at
last
succeeded
in
exposing
all
her
plates
her
patience
and
determination
were
really
wonderful
and
i
am
quite
sure
that
i
should
not
have
obtained
half
her
results
the
kachin
women
were
extraordinary
looking
individuals
they
were
short
and
strongly
built
with
a
mop
of
coarse
hair
cut
straight
all
around
and
thick
lips
stained
with
betel
nut
their
dress
consisted
of
a
short
black
jacket
and
skirt
reaching
to
the
knees
and
ornamented
with
strings
of
beads
and
pieces
of
brass
or
silver
this
tribe
forms
the
largest
part
of
the
population
in
northern
burma
and
also
extends
into
assam
is
fortunate
in
having
comparatively
few
of
them
along
its
western
frontier
for
they
are
an
uncivilized
and
quarrelsome
race
and
frequently
give
the
british
government
considerable
trouble
there
were
only
a
few
burmans
in
the
market
although
the
border
is
hardly
a
dozen
miles
to
the
west
but
the
girls
were
especially
attractive
their
bright
pretty
faces
seemed
always
ready
to
break
into
a
smile
and
their
graceful
figures
draped
in
brilliant
sarongs
were
in
delightful
contrast
to
the
other
not
natives
the
burma
girls
were
not
chewing
betel
nut
which
added
to
their
distinction
the
lips
of
virtually
every
other
woman
and
man
were
stained
from
the
red
juice
which
is
in
universal
use
throughout
india
the
malay
peninsula
and
the
netherlands
indies
in
we
first
noted
it
at
the
good
hope
camp
and
the
shans
are
generally
addicted
to
the
practice
the
permanent
population
of
is
entirely
shan
but
during
the
winter
a
good
many
cantonese
chinamen
come
to
gamble
and
buy
opium
the
drug
is
smuggled
across
the
border
very
easily
and
a
lucrative
trade
is
carried
on
it
can
be
purchased
for
cents
mexican
an
ounce
in
burma
and
sold
for
two
dollars
mexican
an
ounce
in
fu
and
for
ten
dollars
in
shanghai
opium
is
smoked
publicly
in
all
the
tea
houses
the
drug
is
cooked
over
an
alcohol
lamp
and
when
the
pill
is
properly
prepared
it
is
placed
in
the
tiny
bowl
of
the
pipe
held
against
the
flame
and
the
smoke
inhaled
the
process
is
a
rather
complicated
one
and
during
it
the
natives
always
recline
no
visible
effect
is
produced
even
after
smoking
several
pipefuls
but
the
deathly
paleness
and
expressionless
eye
marks
the
inveterate
opium
user
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
chinese
government
has
been
and
is
genuinely
anxious
to
suppress
the
use
of
opium
and
it
has
succeeded
to
a
remarkable
degree
we
heard
of
only
one
instance
of
poppy
growing
in
and
often
met
officials
accompanied
by
a
guard
of
soldiers
on
inspection
trips
indeed
while
we
were
in
the
district
mandarin
arrived
we
were
sitting
in
our
tents
when
the
melodious
notes
of
gongs
floated
in
through
the
mist
they
were
like
the
chimes
of
far
away
cathedral
bells
sounding
nearer
and
louder
but
losing
none
of
the
sweetness
soon
a
long
line
of
soldiers
appeared
and
passed
the
camp
bearing
in
their
midst
a
covered
chair
the
mandarin
established
himself
in
a
spacious
temple
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
village
where
i
visited
him
the
following
day
and
explained
the
difficulty
we
had
had
at
the
he
aided
us
so
effectually
that
all
opposition
to
our
plans
ended
and
we
obtained
a
guide
to
take
us
to
a
hunting
place
on
the
river
three
miles
from
the
burma
border
chapter
xxix
camping
on
the
river
every
morning
the
valley
at
was
filled
with
a
thick
white
mist
and
when
we
broke
camp
at
daylight
each
mule
was
swallowed
up
in
the
fog
as
soon
as
it
left
the
rice
field
we
followed
the
sound
of
the
leader
bell
but
not
until
ten
was
the
entire
caravan
visible
for
thirty
u
the
valley
is
broad
and
flat
as
at
and
filled
with
a
luxuriant
growth
of
rank
grass
but
it
narrows
suddenly
where
the
river
has
carved
its
way
through
a
range
of
hills
the
trail
led
uncertainly
along
a
steep
bank
through
a
dense
tropical
jungle
palms
and
huge
ferns
bananas
and
giant
trees
laced
and
interlaced
with
thorny
vines
and
hanging
creepers
formed
a
living
wall
of
green
as
impenetrable
as
though
it
were
a
net
of
steel
we
followed
the
trail
all
day
sometimes
picking
our
way
among
the
rocks
high
above
the
river
or
padding
along
in
the
soft
earth
almost
at
the
water
edge
at
night
we
camped
in
a
little
clearing
where
some
adventurous
native
had
fought
the
jungle
and
been
defeated
his
bamboo
hut
was
in
ruins
and
the
fields
were
overgrown
with
a
tangle
of
throttling
vegetation
we
had
seen
no
mammals
but
the
birds
along
the
road
were
fascinating
brilliant
green
parrots
screamed
in
the
tree
tops
and
tiny
dressed
in
garments
of
red
and
gold
and
purple
flashed
across
the
trail
like
living
jewels
once
we
heard
a
strange
whirr
and
saw
a
huge
hornbill
flapping
heavily
over
the
river
every
beat
of
his
stiff
wing
feathers
sounding
like
the
motor
of
an
aëroplane
bamboo
partridges
called
from
the
bushes
and
dozens
of
unfamiliar
bird
notes
filled
the
air
at
eleven
on
the
following
morning
we
passed
two
thatched
huts
in
a
little
clearing
beside
the
trail
and
the
guide
remarked
that
our
camping
place
was
not
far
away
we
reached
it
shortly
and
were
delighted
two
enormous
trees
like
great
umbrellas
spread
a
cool
dark
shade
above
a
sparkling
stream
on
the
edge
of
an
abandoned
rice
field
from
a
patch
of
ground
as
level
as
a
floor
where
our
tents
were
pitched
we
could
look
across
the
brown
rice
dykes
to
the
enclosing
walls
of
jungle
and
up
to
the
green
mountain
beyond
a
half
mile
farther
down
the
trail
but
hidden
away
in
the
jungle
lay
a
picturesque
shan
village
of
a
dozen
huts
where
the
guide
said
we
should
be
able
to
find
hunters
as
soon
as
tiffin
was
over
we
went
up
the
creek
with
a
bag
of
steel
traps
to
set
them
on
the
tiny
trails
which
wound
through
the
jungle
in
every
direction
selecting
a
patch
we
buried
the
trap
in
the
center
covered
it
carefully
with
leaves
and
suspended
the
body
of
a
bird
or
a
chunk
of
meat
by
a
wire
over
the
pan
about
three
feet
from
the
ground
a
light
branch
was
fastened
to
the
chain
as
a
drag
when
the
trap
is
pulled
this
invariably
catches
in
the
grass
or
vines
and
while
holding
the
animal
firmly
still
gives
enough
spring
to
prevent
its
freeing
itself
trapping
is
exceedingly
interesting
for
it
is
a
contest
of
wits
between
the
trapper
and
the
animal
with
the
odds
by
no
means
in
favor
of
the
former
the
trap
may
not
be
covered
in
a
natural
way
the
surroundings
may
be
unduly
disturbed
a
scent
of
human
hands
may
linger
about
the
bait
or
there
may
be
numberless
other
possibilities
to
frighten
the
suspicious
animal
in
the
evening
our
guide
brought
a
strange
individual
whom
he
introduced
as
the
best
hunter
in
the
village
he
was
a
tall
mohammedan
chinese
who
dressed
like
a
shan
and
was
married
to
a
shan
woman
he
seemed
to
be
afflicted
with
mental
and
physical
inertia
for
when
he
spoke
it
was
in
slow
drawl
hardly
louder
than
a
whisper
and
every
movement
of
his
body
was
correspondingly
deliberate
we
immediately
named
him
the
dying
rabbit
but
discovered
very
shortly
that
he
really
had
boundless
energy
and
was
an
excellent
hunter
the
next
morning
he
collected
a
dozen
shans
for
beaters
and
we
drove
a
patch
of
jungle
above
camp
but
without
success
there
were
many
sambur
tracks
in
the
clearings
but
we
realized
at
once
that
it
was
going
to
be
difficult
to
get
deer
because
of
the
dense
cover
the
open
places
were
so
few
and
small
that
a
sambur
had
every
chance
to
break
through
without
giving
a
shot
nearly
all
the
beaters
carried
guns
the
dying
rabbit
was
armed
with
a
bolt
action
rifle
into
which
he
had
managed
to
fit
a
shell
and
several
of
the
men
had
winchester
carbines
model
the
guns
had
all
been
brought
from
burma
and
most
were
without
ammunition
but
each
man

the

village
at
the
men
worked
splendidly
under
the
direction
of
the
dying
rabbit
on
the
second
day
they
put
up
a
sambur
which
ran
within
a
hundred
feet
of
us
but
was
absolutely
invisible
in
the
high
grass
when
we
returned
to
camp
we
found
that
a
civet
had
walked
past
our
tent
and
begun
to
eat
the
scraps
about
the
cook
box
regardless
of
the
shouts
of
the
and
servants
who
were
imploring
heller
to
bring
his
gun
after
considerable
difficulty
they
persuaded
him
that
there
really
was
some
cause
for
their
excitement
and
he
shot
the
animal
it
was
probably
ill
for
its
flesh
was
dry
and
yellow
but
the
skin
was
in
excellent
condition
civets
belong
to
the
family
and
are
found
only
in
asia
and
africa
although
they
resemble
cats
superficially
they
are
not
directly
related
to
them
and
their
claws
are
only
partly
retractile
they
are
very
beautiful
animals
with
a
grayish
body
spotted
with
black
a
ringed
tail
and
a
black
and
white
striped
pointed
head
a
scent
gland
near
the
base
of
the
tail
secretes
a
strong
odor
which
although
penetrating
is
not
particularly
disagreeable
the
animals
move
about
chiefly
in
the
early
morning
and
evening
and
at
night
and
prey
upon
birds
eggs
small
mammals
fish
and
frogs
one
which
we
caught
and
photographed
had
a
curious
habit
of
raising
the
hair
on
the
middle
of
its
back
from
the
neck
to
the
tail
whenever
it
was
angry
or
frightened
although
there
were
no
houses
within
half
a
mile
of
camp
we
were
surprised
on
our
first
night
to
hear
cocks
crowing
in
the
jungle
the
note
was
like
that
of
the
ordinary
barnyard
bird
except
that
it
ended
somewhat
more
abruptly
the
next
morning
we
discovered
chanticleer
and
all
his
harem
in
a
deserted
rice
field
and
he
flew
toward
the
jungle
in
a
flash
of
red
and
gold
i
dropped
him
and
one
of
his
hens
with
a
right
and
left
of
sixes
and
found
that
they
were
jungle
fowl
in
full
plumage
the
cock
was
a
splendid
bird
the
long
neck
feathers
hackles
spread
over
his
back
and
wings
like
a
shimmering
golden
mantle
but
it
was
hardly
more
beautiful
than
the
black
of
his
underparts
and
tail
picture
to
yourself
a
red
gamecock
and
you
have
him
in
all
his
glory
except
that
his
tail
is
drooping
and
he
is
more
in
his
general
bearing
the
female
was
a
trim
little
bird
with
a
lilac
sheen
to
her
brown
feathers
and
looked
much
like
a
game
bantam
hen
the
jungle
fowl
is
the
direct
ancestor
of
our
barnyard
hens
and
roosters
which
were
probably
first
domesticated
in
burma
and
adjacent
countries
long
before
the
dawn
of
authentic
history
according
to
tradition
the
chinese
received
their
poultry
from
the
west
about
and
they
are
figured
in
babylonian
cylinders
between
the
sixth
and
seventh
centuries
although
they
were
probably
introduced
in
greece
through
persia
there
is
no
direct
evidence
as
to
when
and
how
they
reached
europe
the
jungle
fowl
inhabit
northern
india
burma
countries
the
malay
peninsula
and
the
philippine
islands
a
related
species
is
found
in
ceylon
another
in
southern
india
and
a
fourth
in
java
we
found
the
jungle
fowl
wild
and
hard
to
kill
even
where
they
were
seldom
hunted
during
the
heat
of
the
day
they
remain
in
thick
cover
but
in
cloudy
weather
and
in
the
early
morning
and
evening
they
come
out
into
clearings
to
feed
at
our
camp
on
the
river
we
could
usually
put
up
a
few
birds
on
the
edge
of
the
deserted
rice
fields
which
stretched
up
into
the
jungle
but
they
were
never
far
away
from
the
edge
of
the
forest
we
sometimes
saw
single
birds
of
either
sex
but
usually
a
cock
had
with
him
six
or
eight
hens
it
was
interesting
to
watch
such
a
flock
feeding
in
the
open
the
male
resplendent
in
his
vivid
dress
shone
like
a
piece
of
gold
against
the
dull
brown
of
the
dry
grass
and
industriously
ran
about
among
his
trim
little
hens
rounding
up
the
stragglers
and
directing
his
harem
with
a
few
clucks
whenever
he
found
some
unusually
tempting
food
it
was
his
duty
too
to
watch
for
danger
and
he
usually
would
send
the
flock
whirring
into
the
jungle
while
they
were
well
beyond
shotgun
range
when
flushed
from
the
open
the
birds
nearly
always
would
alight
in
the
first
large
tree
and
sit
for
a
few
moments
before
flying
deeper
into
the
jungle
we
caught
several
hens
in
our
steel
traps
and
one
morning
at
the
edge
of
a
swamp
i
shot
a
jungle
fowl
and
a
woodcock
with
a
right
and
left
as
they
flushed
together
we
were
at
the
camp
at
the
beginning
of
the
mating
season
for
the
jungle
fowl
it
is
said
that
they
brood
from
january
to
april
according
to
locality
laying
from
eight
to
twelve
creamy
white
eggs
under
a
bamboo
clump
or
some
dense
thicket
where
a
few
leaves
have
been
scratched
together
for
a
nest
the
hen
announces
the
laying
of
an
egg
by
means
of
a
proud
cackle
and
the
chicks
themselves
have
the
characteristic
peep
peep
peep
of
the
domestic
birds
after
the
breeding
season
the
beautiful
red
and
gold
neck
hackles
of
the
male
sometimes
are
molted
and
replaced
by
short
blackish
feathers
there
seems
to
be
some
uncertainty
as
to
whether
the
cocks
are
polygamous
but
our
observations
tend
to
show
that
they
are
we
never
saw
more
than
one
male
in
a
flock
and
in
only
one
or
two
instances
were
the
birds
in
pairs
the
cocks
are
inveterate
fighters
like
the
domestic
birds
and
their
long
curved
spurs
are
exceedingly
effective
weapons
we
set
a
trap
for
a
leopard
on
a
hill
behind
the
river
camp
and
on
the
second
afternoon
it
contained
a
splendid
polecat
this
animal
is
a
member
of
the
family
mustelidæ
which
includes
mink
otter
weasels
skunks
and
ferrets
and
with
its
brown
body
deep
yellow
throat
and
long
tail
is
really
very
handsome
polecats
inhabit
the
northern
hemisphere
and
are
closely
allied
to
the
ferret
which
so
often
is
domesticated
and
used
in
hunting
rats
and
rabbits
we
found
them
to
be
abundant
in
the
low
valleys
along
the
burma
border
and
often
saw
them
during
the
day
running
across
a
jungle
path
or
on
the
lower
branches
of
a
tree
the
polecat
is
a
little
beast
and
kills
everything
that
comes
in
its
way
for
the
pure
love
of
killing
even
when
its
appetite
has
been
satisfied
on
the
third
morning
we
found
two
civets
in
the
traps
the
cook
told
me
that
some
animal
had
stolen
a
chicken
from
one
of
his
boxes
during
the
night
and
we
set
a
trap
only
a
few
yards
from
our
tent
on
a
trail
leading
into
the
grass
the
civet
was
evidently
the
thief
for
the
cook
boxes
were
not
bothered
again
inspecting
the
traps
every
morning
and
evening
was
a
delightful
part
of
our
camp
life
it
was
like
opening
a
christmas
package
as
we
walked
up
the
trails
for
each
one
held
interesting
possibilities
and
the
mammals
of
the
region
were
so
varied
that
surprises
were
always
in
store
for
us
besides
civets
and
polecats
we
caught
mongooses
palm
civets
and
other
carnivores
the
small
traps
yielded
a
new
several
new
rats
and
an
interesting
shrew
we
saw
a
few
huge
squirrels
and
shot
one
it
was
inches
long
coal
black
above
and
yellow
below
the
animals
were
very
shy
and
as
they
climbed
about
in
the
highest
trees
they
were
by
no
means
easy
to
see
or
shoot
they
represent
an
interesting
group
confined
to
india
siam
the
malay
peninsula
the
islands
of
the
dutch
east
indies
and
borneo
chapter
xxx
monkey
hunting
our
most
exciting
sport
at
the
camp
was
hunting
monkeys
every
morning
we
heard
querulous
notes
which
sounded
much
like
the
squealing
of
very
young
puppies
and
which
were
followed
by
long
siren
wails
when
the
shrill
notes
had
reached
their
highest
pitch
they
would
sink
into
low
mellow
tones
exceedingly
musical
the
calls
usually
started
shortly
after
daylight
and
continued
until
about
nine
or
later
if
the
day
was
dark
or
rainy
they
would
be
answered
from
different
parts
of
the
jungle
and
often
sounded
from
half
a
dozen
places
simultaneously
the
natives
assured
us
that
the
cries
were
made
by
monkeys
and
several
times
we
started
in
pursuit
but
they
always
ceased
long
before
we
had
found
a
way
through
the
jungle
to
the
spot
from
which
they
came
at
last
we
succeeded
in
locating
the
animals
we
were
inspecting
a
line
of
traps
placed
along
a
trail
which
led
up
a
valley
to
a
wide
plateau
suddenly
the
squealing
began
followed
by
a
low
tremulous
wail
it
seemed
almost
over
our
heads
but
the
trees
were
empty
we
stole
silently
along
the
trail
for
a
hundred
yards
and
turned
into
a
dry
creek
bed
which
led
up
the
bottom
of
the
forested
ravine
with
infinite
caution
breathing
hard
from
excitement
we
slipped
along
scanning
the
top
of
every
tree
a
hornbill
sitting
on
a
dead
branch
caught
sight
of
us
and
flapped
heavily
away
emitting
horrid
squawks
a
flock
of
parrots
screamed
overhead
and
a
squirrel
followed
persistently
scolding
at
the
top
of
its
voice
but
the
monkeys
continued
to
call
the
querulous
squealing
abruptly
ceased
and
we
stood
motionless
beside
a
tree
for
an
instant
the
countless
jungle
sounds
were
hushed
in
a
breathless
stillness
then
low
and
sweet
sounded
a
moaning
wail
which
swelled
into
deep
full
tones
it
vibrated
an
instant
filling
all
the
forest
with
its
richness
and
slowly
died
away
again
and
again
it
floated
over
the
tree
tops
and
we
listened
strangely
moved
for
it
was
like
the
music
of
an
exquisite
contralto
voice
at
last
it
ceased
but
ere
the
echoes
had
reached
the
valley
the
jungle
was
ringing
with
an
unlovely
siren
screech
the
spell
was
broken
and
we
moved
on
alert
and
tense
the
trees
stretched
upward
full
one
hundred
and
fifty
feet
their
tops
spread
out
in
a
leafy
roof
long
ropelike
vines
festooned
the
upper
branches
and
a
luxuriant
growth
of
parasitic
vegetation
clothed
the
giant
trunks
in
a
swaying
mass
of
living
green
far
above
the
taller
trees
a
gaunt
gray
monarch
of
the
forest
towered
in
splendid
isolation
in
its
topmost
branches
we
could
just
discern
a
dozen
balls
of
yellow
fur
from
which
proceeded
discordant
squeals
it
was
long
range
for
a
shotgun
but
the
rifles
were
all
in
camp
i
fired
a
charge
of
at
the
lowest
monkey
and
as
the
gun
roared
out
the
tree
tops
suddenly
sprang
into
life
they
were
filled
with
running
leaping
hairy
forms
swinging
at
incredible
speed
from
branch
to
branch
not
a
dozen
but
a
score
of
monkeys
yellow
brown
and
gray
the
one
at
which
i
had
shot
seemed
unaffected
and
threw
itself
full
twenty
feet
to
a
horizontal
limb
below
and
to
the
right
i
fired
again
and
he
stopped
ran
a
few
steps
forward
and
swung
to
the
underside
of
the
branch
at
the
third
charge
he
hung
suspended
by
one
arm
and
dropped
heavily
to
the
ground
stone
dead
we
tossed
him
into
the
dry
creek
bed
and
dashed
up
the
hill
where
the
branches
were
still
swaying
as
the
monkeys
traveled
through
the
tree
tops
they
had
a
long
start
and
it
was
a
hopeless
chase
at
every
step
our
clothes
were
caught
by
the
clinging
thorns
our
hands
were
torn
and
our
faces
scratched
and
bleeding
in
ten
minutes
they
had
disappeared
and
we
turned
about
to
find
the
dead
animal
suddenly
yvette
saw
a
splash
of
leaves
in
the
top
of
a
tree
below
us
and
a
big
brown
monkey
swung
out
on
a
pendent
vine
i
fired
instantly
and
the
animal
hung
suspended
whirled
slowly
around
and
dropped
to
the
ground
before
i
had
reloaded
my
gun
it
gathered
itself
together
and
dashed
off
through
the
woods
on
three
legs
faster
than
a
man
could
run
the
animal
had
been
hiding
on
a
branch
and
when
we
passed
had
tried
to
steal
away
undiscovered
we
found
the
dead
monkey
a
young
male
in
the
creek
bed
and
sat
down
to
examine
it
it
was
evidently
a
gibbon
for
its
long
arms
round
head
and
tailless
body
were
unmistakable
but
in
every
species
with
which
i
was
familiar
the
male
was
black
this
one
was
yellow
and
we
knew
it
to
be
a
prize
that
there
were
two
other
species
in
the
herd
was
certain
for
we
had
seen
both
brown
and
gray
monkeys
as
they
dashed
away
among
the
trees
but
the
gibbons
were
far
more
interesting
than
the
others
illustration

head

a

gibbons
are
probably
the
most
primitive
in
skull
and
teeth
of
all
the
anthropoid
or
manlike
apes
the
group
which
also
includes
the
gorilla
chimpanzee
and
orangutan
they
are
apparently
an
earlier
offshoot
of
the
anthropoid
stem
as
held
by
most
authorities
and
the
giant
apes
and
man
are
probably
a
later
branch
gibbons
are
essentially
oriental
being
found
in
india
burma
siam
tonking
borneo
and
the
islands
of
hainan
sulu
sumatra
and
java
for
the
remainder
of
our
stay
at
the
river
camp
we
devoted
ourselves
to
hunting
monkeys
and
soon
discovered
that
the
three
species
we
had
first
seen
were
totally
different
one
was
the
yellow
gibbon
another
a
brown
baboon
and
the
third
a
huge
gray
ape
with
a
long
tail
known
as
the
langur
on
the
first
day
all
three
species
were
together
feeding
upon
some
large
green
beans
and
this
happened
once
again
but
usually
they
were
in
separate
herds
the
gibbons
soon
became
extremely
wild
although
the
same
troop
could
usually
be
found
in
the
valley
where
we
had
first
discovered
them
they
chose
hillsides
where
it
was
almost
impossible
to
stalk
them
because
of
the
thorny
jungle
usually
when
they
called
it
was
from
the
upper
branches
of
a
dead
tree
where
they
could
not
only
scan
every
inch
of
the
ground
below
but
were
almost
beyond
the
range
of
a
shotgun
sometimes
we
climbed
upward
almost
on
our
hands
and
knees
grasping
vines
and
creepers
drawing
ourselves
up
by
tree
trunks
crawling
under
thorny
shrubs
and
bushes
slipping
falling
scrambling
through
the
indescribable
tangle
we
went
forward
only
when
the
calls
were
echoing
through
the
jungle
and
stood
motionless
as
the
wailing
ceased
but
in
spite
of
all
our
care
they
would
see
or
hear
us
then
in
sudden
silence
there
would
be
a
tremor
of
the
branches
splash
after
splash
of
leaves
and
the
herd
would
swing
away
through
the
trackless
tree
tops
the
gibbons
are
well
named
or
for
they
are
entirely
arboreal
and
although
awkward
and
almost
helpless
on
the
ground
once
their
long
thin
hands
touch
a
branch
they
become
transformed
as
by
a
miracle
they
launch
themselves
into
space
catch
a
limb
twenty
feet
away
swing
for
an
instant
and
hurl
themselves
to
another
it
is
possible
for
them
to
travel
through
the
trees
faster
than
a
man
can
run
even
on
open
ground
and
when
one
examines
their
limbs
the
reason
is
apparent
the
fore
arms
are
so
exceedingly
long
that
the
tips
of
the
fingers
can
touch
the
ground
when
the
animal
stands
erect
and
the
slender
hands
are
longer
than
the
feet
the
gibbons
were
exceedingly
difficult
to
kill
and
would
never
drop
until
stone
dead
once
i
shot
an
old
male
with
my
mm
mannlicher
rifle
at
about
one
hundred
yards
and
even
though
the
ball
had
gone
clear
through
his
body
he
hung
for
several
minutes
before
he
dropped
into
a
tangle
of
vines
it
was
fifteen
minutes
before
we
were
able
to
work
our
way
through
the
jungle
to
the
spot
where
the
animal
had
fallen
and
we
had
been
searching
for
nearly
half
an
hour
when
suddenly
my
wife
shouted
that
a
monkey
was
running
along
a
branch
above
our
heads
i
fired
with
the
shotgun
at
a
mass
of
moving
leaves
and
killed
a
second
gibbon
which
had
been
hiding
in
the
thick
foliage
instead
of
running
the
animals
would
sometimes
disappear
as
completely
as
though
they
had
vanished
in
the
air
after
being
fooled
several
times
we
learned
to
conceal
ourselves
in
the
bushes
where
we
could
watch
the
trees
and
sooner
or
later
the
monkeys
would
try
to
steal
away
the
langurs
and
baboons
were
by
no
means
as
wild
as
the
gibbons
and
were
found
in
larger
herds
some
of
the
langurs
were
carrying
babies
which
clung
to
their
mothers
between
the
fore
legs
and
did
not
seem
to
impede
them
in
the
slightest
on
their
leaps
through
the
tree
tops
the
young
of
this
species
are
bright
and
strangely
unlike
the
gray
adults
as
they
grow
older
the
red
hair
is
gradually
replaced
by
gray
but
the
tail
is
the
last
part
of
the
body
to
change
heller
captured
one
of
the
tiny
red
monkeys
and
brought
it
back
to
camp
in
his
coat
pocket
the
little
fellow
was
only
a
few
days
old
and
of
course
absolutely
helpless
when
it
was
wrapped
in
cotton
with
only
its
queer
little
wizened
face
and
blue
eyes
visible
it
had
a
startling
resemblance
to
a
human
baby
until
its
long
tail
would
suddenly
flop
into
sight
and
dispel
the
illusion
it
lived
only
four
days
in
spite
of
constant
care
there
are
species
of
langurs
all
of
which
are
confined
to
the
orient
in
some
parts
of
india
the
animals
are
sacred
and
climb
about
the
houses
or
wander
in
the
streets
of
villages
quite
without
fear
at
times
they
do
so
much
damage
to
crops
that
the
natives
who
do
not
dare
to
kill
the
animals
themselves
implore
foreigners
to
do
so
the
langurs
are
not
confined
to
the
tropics
but
in
the
tibetan
mountains
range
far
up
into
the
snow
and
enjoy
the
cold
weather
in
the
market
at
we
saw
several
skins
of
these
animals
which
had
been
brought
down
by
the
tibetans
the
hair
was
long
and
silky
and
was
used
by
the
chinese
for
rugs
and
coats
the
species
which
we
killed
at
the
river
camp
like
all
others
of
the
genus
was
interesting
because
of
the
long
hairs
of
the
head
which
form
a
distinct
ridge
on
the
occiput
we
never
heard
the
animals
utter
sounds
but
it
is
said
that
the
common
indian
langur
gives
a
loud
whoop
as
it
runs
through
the
tree
tops
often
when
a
tiger
is
prowling
about
the
jungle
the
indian
langurs
will
follow
the
beast
keeping
in
the
branches
just
above
its
head
and
scolding
loudly
the
baboon
or
macaque
which
we
killed
on
the
was
a
close
relative
of
the
species
which
one
sees
parading
solemnly
about
the
streets
of
calcutta
bombay
and
other
indian
cities
in
agra
the
home
of
the
beautiful
taj
mahal
the
monkey
temple
is
visited
by
every
tourist
a
large
herd
of
macaques
lives
in
the
grounds
and
at
a
few
chuckling
calls
from
the
native
attendants
will
come
trooping
over
the
walls
for
the
food
which
is
kept
on
sale
at
the
gate
these
animals
are
surprisingly
tame
and
make
most
amusing
pets
on
one
of
our
hunts
my
wife
and
i
discovered
a
water
hole
in
the
midst
of
a
dense
jungle
where
the
mud
was
trodden
hard
by
sambur
muntjac
wild
boar
and
other
animals
we
decided
to
spend
a
night
watching
beside
it
but
the
dying
rabbit
who
was
enthusiastic
in
the
day
time
lost
his
courage
as
the
sunlight
waned
very
doubtfully
he
consented
to
go
although
the
trip
netted
us
no
tangible
results
it
was
an
experience
of
which
we
often
think
we
started
just
at
dusk
and
installed
ourselves
in
the
bushes
a
few
yards
from
the
water
hole
in
half
an
hour
the
forest
was
enveloped
in
the
velvety
blackness
of
the
tropic
night
not
a
star
nor
a
gleam
of
light
was
visible
and
i
could
not
see
my
hand
before
my
face
we
sat
absolutely
motionless
and
listened
to
the
breath
of
the
jungle
which
although
without
definite
sound
was
vibrant
with
life
now
and
then
a
muntjac
barked
hoarsely
and
the
roar
of
a
sambur
stag
thrilled
us
like
an
electric
shock
once
a
wild
boar
grunted
on
the
opposite
bank
of
the
river
the
sound
coming
to
us
clear
and
sharp
through
the
stillness
although
the
animal
was
far
away
tiny
forest
creatures
rustled
all
about
us
in
the
leaves
and
a
small
animal
ran
across
my
wife
lap
leaping
frantically
down
the
hill
as
it
felt
her
move
for
five
hours
we
sat
there
absolutely
motionless
although
no
animals
came
to
the
water
hole
we
were
silent
with
a
great
happiness
as
we
groped
our
way
back
to
camp
for
we
had
been
close
to
the
heart
of
the
jungle
and
were
thrilled
with
the
mystery
of
the
night
chapter
xxxi
the
shans
of
the
burma
border
we
saw
many
shans
at
the
river
for
not
only
was
there
a
village
half
a
mile
beyond
our
camp
but
natives
were
passing
continually
along
the
trail
on
their
way
to
and
from
the
burma
frontier
the
village
was
named
its
chief
was
absent
when
we
arrived
but
the
natives
were
cordial
and
agreed
to
hunt
with
us
when
the
head
man
returned
however
he
was
most
unfriendly
he
forbade
the
villagers
from
coming
to
our
camp
and
arguments
were
of
no
avail
it
soon
became
evident
that
only
force
could
change
his
attitude
and
one
morning
with
all
our
servants
and
we
visited
his
house
he
was
informed
that
unless
he
ceased
his
opposition
and
ordered
his
men
to
assist
us
in
hunting
we
would
take
him
to
for
trial
before
the
mandarin
he
grudgingly
complied
and
we
had
no
further
trouble
we
found
the
shans
at
to
be
simple
and
honest
people
but
abnormally
lazy
during
our
three
weeks
stay
not
a
single
trap
was
stolen
although
the
natives
prized
them
highly
and
often
brought
to
us
those
in
which
animals
had
been
caught
shans
were
continually
about
our
camp
where
boxes
were
left
unlocked
but
not
an
article
of
our
equipment
was
missed

the
shans
elevated
their
houses
on
poles
and
built
an
open
porch
in
front
of
the
door
while
the
dwellings
at
and
farther
up
the
valley
were
all
placed
upon
the
ground
the
thatched
roofs
overhung
several
feet
and
the
sides
of
the
houses
were
open
so
that
the
free
passage
of
air
kept
them
delightfully
cool
moreover
they
were
surprisingly
clean
for
the
floors
were
of
split
bamboo
and
the
inmates
if
they
wore
sandals
left
them
at
the
door
in
the
center
of
the
single
room
on
a
large
flat
stone
a
small
fire
always
burned
but
much
of
the
cooking
was
done
on
the
porch
where
a
tiny
pavilion
had
been
erected
over
the
hearth
the
shans
at
had
no
visible
means
of
support
the
extensive
rice
paddys
indicated
that
in
the
past
there
had
been
considerable
cultivation
but
the
fields
were
and
abandoned
the
villagers
purchased
all
their
vegetables
from
the
mohammedan
hunter
and
two
other
chinese
who
lived
a
mile
up
the
trail
or
from
passing
caravans
whom
they
sometimes
entertained
in
all
probability
they
lived
upon
the
sale
of
smuggled
opium
for
they
were
only
a
few
miles
from
the
burma
border
virtually
every
shan
we
saw
in
the
south
was
heavily
tattooed
usually
the
right
leg
alone
but
sometimes
both
were
completely
covered
from
the
hip
to
the
knee
with
intricate
designs
in
black
or
red
the
ornamentations
often
extended
entirely
around
the
body
over
the
abdomen
and
waist
but
less
frequently
on
the
breast
and
arms
all
the
natives
were
inordinately
proud
of
these
decorations
and
usually
fastened
their
wide
trousers
in
such
a
way
as
to
display
them
to
the
best
advantage
we
often
could
persuade
a
man
to
pose
before
the
camera
by
admiring
his
tattoo
marks
and
it
was
most
amusing
to
watch
his
childlike
pleasure
the
shan
tribe
is
a
large
one
with
many
subdivisions
and
it
is
probable
that
at
one
time
it
inhabited
a
large
part
of
china
south
of
the
yangtze
river
indeed
there
is
reason
to
believe
that
the
cantonese
chinamen
are
chiefly
of
shan
stock
and
the
facial
resemblance
between
the
two
races
certainly
is
remarkable
although
the
shans
formerly
ruled
a
vast
territory
in
before
its
conquest
by
the
mongol
emperors
of
china
in
the
thirteenth
century
and
at
one
time
actually
subdued
burma
and
established
a
dynasty
of
their
own
at
present
the
only
independent
kingdom
of
the
race
is
that
of
siam
by
far
the
greatest
number
of
shans
live
in
states
tributary
to
burma
china
and
siam
and
in
inhabit
almost
all
of
the
southern
valleys
below
an
altitude
of
feet
the
reason
that
the
chinese
allow
them
to
hold
such
an
extent
of
fertile
land
is
because
the
low
plains
are
considered
unhealthy
and
the
chinese
can
not
or
will
not
live
there
whether
or
not
the
malarial
fever
of
the
valleys
is
so
exceedingly
deadly
remains
to
be
proved
but
the
chinese
believe
it
to
be
so
and
the
result
is
the
same
where
the
shans
are
numerous
enough
to
have
a
chief
of
their
own
they
live
in
a
state
for
although
their
head
man
is
subordinate
to
the
district
chinese
official
the
latter
seldom
interferes
with
the
internal
affairs
of
the
tribe
the
shans
are
a
short
race
with
a
distinct
mongolian
type
of
features
and
rather
fair
complexions
their
dress
varies
decidedly
with
the
region
but
the
men
of
the
southern
part
of
the
province
on
the
river
wear
a
pair
of
enormous
trousers
so
baggy
that
they
are
almost
skirtlike

jacket
and
a
large
white
or
pink
turban

material
and
may
be
worn
in
a
high
cylinder
a
low

other
shapes

to
the

prisoners
of
war
in
burma
the
camp
at
was
a
supremely
happy
one
and
we
left
it
on
march
with
much
regret
its
resources
seemed
to
be
almost
exhausted
and
the
mohammedan
hunter
assured
us
that
at
a
village
called
we
would
find
excellent
shooting
we
asked
him
the
distance
and
he
replied
about
a
long
bamboo
joint
away
it
required
three
days
to
get
there
whether
the
man
had
ever
been
to
we
do
not
know
but
we
eventually
found
it
to
be
a
tiny
village
built
into
the
side
of
a
hill
in
an
absolutely
barren
country
where
there
was
not
a
vestige
of
cover
our
journey
there
was
not
uneventful
we
left
with
high
hopes
which
were
somewhat
dampened
after
a
day
unsuccessful
hunting
at
the
spot
where
our
caravan
crossed
the
river
with
a
shan
guide
we
traveled
due
north
along
a
good
trail
which
led
through
dense
jungle
where
there
was
not
a
clearing
or
a
sign
of
life
in
the
afternoon
we
noted
that
the
trail
bore
strongly
to
the
west
and
ascended
rapidly
soon
we
had
left
the
jungle
and
emerged
into
an
absolutely
treeless
valley
between
high
barren
hills
we
knew
that
the
burma
frontier
could
not
be
far
away
and
in
a
few
moments
we
passed
a
large
square
boundary
stone
a
hundred
yards
on
the
other
side
the
hills
were
covered
with
bright
green
stalks
and
here
and
there
a
field
glistened
with
white
poppy
blossoms
the
guide
insisted
that
we
were
on
the
direct
road
to
which
for
the
first
time
he
said
was
in
burma
on
our
map
it
was
marked
well
over
the
border
in
chinese
territory
and
we
were
greatly
puzzled
about
six
the
brown
huts
of
a
village
were
silhouetted
against
the
sky
on
a
tiny
knoll
in
the
midst
of
a
grove
of
beautiful
trees
and
we
camped
at
the
edge
of
a
water
hole
the
pool
was
almost
liquid
mud
but
we
were
told
that
it
was
the
only
water
supply
of
the
village
and
its
cattle
as
though
to
prove
the
statement
a
dozen
buffalos
ambled
slowly
down
the
hill
and
stood
half
submerged
in
the
brown
liquid
placidly
chewing
their
cuds
meanwhile
shan
women
with
buckets
in
their
hands
were
constantly
arriving
at
the
pond
for
their
evening
supply
of
water
we
had
no
filter
and
it
was
nauseating
to
think
of
drinking
the
filthy
liquid
but
there
was
no
alternative
and
after
repeated
boiling
and
several
strainings
we
settled
it
with
alum
and
disguised
its
taste
in
tea
and
soup
after
dinner
we
questioned
the
few
natives
who
spoke
chinese
but
we
became
only
more
and
more
confused
they
knew
of
no
such
place
as
and
our
shan
guide
had
discreetly
disappeared
but
they
were
familiar
with
the
trail
to
a
village
farther
west
in
burma
and
moreover
they
said
that
two
hundred
foreign
soldiers
were
stationed
there
we
were
quite
certain
that
they
must
be
native
indian
troops
but
thought
that
a
white
officer
might
perhaps
be
in
command
we
did
not
wish
to
cross
the
frontier
because
of
possible
political
difficulties
since
we
had
no
permits
to
shoot
in
burma
but
there
seemed
to
be
no
alternative
for
we
were
hopelessly
bewildered
by
the
mythical
we
eventually
discovered
that
there
were
two
villages
by
that
name
one
in
burma
and
the
other
in
china
where
it
was
correctly
placed
on
the
map
which
we
were
using
while
we
were
discussing
the
matter
a
tremendous
altercation
arose
between
the
chinese
and
the
servants
for
some
time
roy
did
not
interfere
supposing
it
to
be
a
personal
quarrel
but
the
disturbance
at
last
became
unbearable
calling
wu
we
learned
that
because
we
had
been
so
careful
to
avoid
english
territory
the
had
conceived
the
idea
that
for
some
reason
we
were
afraid
to
meet
other
foreigners
since
we
had
inadvertently
crossed
into
burma
it
appeared
to
them
that
it
would
be
an
opportune
time
to
extort
an
increase
of
wages
they
announced
therefore
that
unless
extra
money
was
given
them
at
once
they
would
untie
the
loads
and
leave
us
they
were
hardly
prepared
for
what
followed
however
taking
his
mannlicher
rifle
roy
called
the
together
and
told
them
that
if
any
man
touched
a
load
he
would
begin
to
shoot
the
mules
and
that
if
they
made
the
slightest
resistance
the
gun
would
be
turned
on
them
a
mules
represent
all
his
property
and
they
did
not
relish
the
turn
affairs
had
taken
they
subsided
at
once
but
we
had
the
loads
guarded
during
the
night
in
the
morning
the
were
exceedingly
surprised
when
they
learned
that
we
were
going
to
and
their
change
of
front
was
laughable
they
were
as
humble
and
anxious
to
please
as
they
had
been
belligerent
the
night
before
the
trail
led
over
the
same
treeless
rolling
hills
through
which
we
had
passed
on
the
previous
afternoon
there
was
only
one
village
but
it
was
surrounded
by
poppy
fields
in
full
blossom
it
must
be
a
rather
difficult
matter
for
a
native
living
in
china
near
the
border
to
understand
why
he
should
not
be
allowed
to
produce
the
lucrative
opium
while
only
a
few
yards
away
over
an
imaginary
line
it
can
be
planted
without
restriction
poppies
seem
to
grow
on
hillsides
better
than
on
level
ground
the
plants
begin
to
blossom
in
late
february
and
the
petals
when
about
to
fall
are
collected
for
the
purpose
of
making
leaves
with
which
to
cover
the
balls
of
opium
the
seed
pods
which
are
left
after
the
petals
drop
off
are
scarified
vertically
at
intervals
of
two
or
three
days
by
means
of
a
sharp
cutting
instrument
the
operation
is
usually
performed
about
four
in
the
afternoon
and
the
opium
in
the
form
of
dried
juice
is
collected
the
next
morning
when
china
in
forbade
the
consumption
of
opium
and
the
growing
of
poppies
it
was
estimated
that
there
were
from
to
thirty
millions
of
smokers
in
the
empire
we
reached
about
one
in
the
afternoon
and
found
it
to
be
a
straggling
village
built
on
two
sides
of
a
deep
ravine
with
a
mixed
population
of
shans
and
chinese
it
happened
to
be
the
weekly
market
day
and
the
bazaar
was
crowded
a
number
of
indian
soldiers
in
khaki
were
standing
about
and
i
called
out
to
roy
i
wonder
if
any
of
them
speak
english
instantly
a
little
fellow
approached
with
cap
in
hand
and
said
yes
madame
i
speak
english
one
can
not
realize
how
strange
it
seemed
to
hear
our
own
language
from
a
native
in
this
spot
i
he
was
the
compounder
or
medical
assistant
and
told
us
that
the
hundred
native
troops
were
in
charge
of
a
white
officer
whose
house
was
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
river
gorge
he
guided
us
to
a
temple
and
while
the
mules
were
being
unloaded
in
walked
a
tall
handsome
young
british
officer
who
introduced
himself
as
captain
clive
he
was
almost
speechless
with
surprise
at
seeing
me
for
he
had
not
spoken
a
sentence
in
english
or
seen
a
white
person
since
his
arrival
at
this
lonely
post
five
months
before
he
asked
us
at
once
to
come
to
his
quarters
for
tiffin
and
we
accepted
gladly
on
the
way
he
gave
us
our
first
news
of
the
outside
world
for
we
had
been
beyond
communication
of
any
sort
for
months
and
we
learned
that
the
united
states
had
severed
diplomatic
relations
with
germany
captain
clive
bungalow
was
a
bamboo
house
with
a
broad
verandah
and
thatched
with
straw
it
was
delightfully
cool
and
dark
after
the
glare
of
the
yellow
plains
about
us
and
in
perfect
order
the
care
which
britishers
take
to
keep
from
letting
down
while
guarding
the
frontiers
of
their
vast
empire
is
proverbial
and
captain
clive
was
a
splendid
example
of
the
indian
officer
he
was
as
and
as
though
he
had
been
expecting
us
for
days
and
the
tiffin
to
which
we
sat
down
was
as
dainty
and
well
served
as
it
could
have
been
in
the
midst
of
civilization
the
great
lord
clive
of
india
was
an
ancestor
of
our
young
officer
who
had
been
temporarily
detached
from
his
regiment
the
baluchis
and
sent
on
border
duty
he
was
very
unhappy
for
his
brother
officers
were
in
active
service
in
east
africa
and
he
had
tried
to
resign
several
times
but
the
indian
government
would
not
release
him
when
we
reached
rangoon
some
months
later
we
were
glad
to
learn
that
he
had
rejoined
his
regiment
and
was
at
the
front
was
a
recently
established
winter
station
and
in
may
would
be
abandoned
when
the
troop
returned
to
lashio
ten
days
journey
away
comfortable
barracks
cook
houses
and
a
hospital
had
been
erected
beside
a
large
space
which
had
been
cleaned
of
turf
for
a
parade
ground
captain
clive
was
in
communication
by
heliograph
with
lashio
at
the
end
of
the
railroad
and
received
a
of
world
news
two
or
three
times
a
week
with
mirrors
during
the
day
and
lanterns
at
night
messages
were
flashed
from
one
mountain
top
to
another
and
under
favorable
conditions
reached
lashio
in
seven
or
eight
hours
we
pitched
our
tents
a
short
distance
from
the
barracks
in
an
open
field
for
there
was
no
available
shade
although
captain
clive
was
perfectly
satisfied
with
our
passports
and
credentials
he
could
not
let
us
proceed
until
he
had
communicated
with
the
indian
government
by
heliograph
the
border
was
being
guarded
very
closely
to
prevent
german
sympathizers
from
crossing
into
burma
from
china
and
inciting
the
native
tribes
to
rebellion
in
december
a
rather
serious
uprising
among
the
kachins
in
the
myitkyina
district
on
the
upper
waters
of
the
irawadi
river
had
been
incited
by
a
foreigner
i
believe
and
clive
had
assisted
in
suppressing
it
the
indian
government
was
taking
no
further
chances
and
had
given
strict
orders
to
arrest
and
hold
anyone
other
than
a
native
who
crossed
the
border
from
china
very
fortunately
goffe
at
fu
had
communicated
with
the
of
burma
concerning
our
expedition
and
we
consequently
expected
no
trouble
but
captain
clive
could
not
let
us
proceed
until
he
had
orders
to
do
so
from
the
superintendent
of
the
northern
shan
states
through
a
delayed
message
this
permission
did
not
reach
him
for
five
days
and
in
the
meantime
we
made
the
most
of
the
limited
collecting
resources
which
afforded
clive
ordered
his
day
like
all
the
residents
of
burma
he
rose
at
six
and
after
coffee
and
rolls
had
drill
for
two
hours
at
half
past
ten
a
heavy
meal
took
the
place
of
breakfast
and
tiffin
tea
with
sandwiches
and
toast
was
served
at
three
and
dinner
at
eight
his
company
was
composed
of
several
different
native
tribes
and
each
religious
caste
had
its
own
cook
and
water
carrier
for
a
man
of
one
caste
could
not
prepare
meals
for
men
of
another
it
is
an
extraordinary
system
but
one
which
appears
to
operate
perfectly
well
under
the
adaptable
english
government
certainly
one
of
the
great
elements
in
the
success
of
the
british
as
colonizers
is
their
respect
for
native
customs
and
superstitions
the
company
drilled
splendidly
and
we
were
surprised
to
hear
all
commands
given
in
english
although
none
of
the
men
could
understand
that
language
this
is
done
to
enable
british
and
indian
troops
to
maneuver
together
captain
clive
himself
spoke
hindustani
to
his
officers
in
the
evening
the
men
played
football
on
the
parade
ground
and
it
seemed
as
though
we
had
suddenly
been
transported
into
civilization
on
the
magic
carpet
of
the
arabian
nights
every
morning
we
went
shooting
at
daylight
and
returned
about
nine
conditions
were
not
favorable
for
small
mammals
and
although
we
could
undoubtedly
have
caught
a
few
civets
mongooses
and
cats
we
did
not
set
a
line
of
steel
traps
for
we
expected
to
leave
at
any
time
our
attention
was
mostly
devoted
to
bird
collecting
and
we
obtained
about
two
hundred
interesting
specimens
we
had
our
meal
each
day
with
captain
clive
and
he
dined
with
us
in
the
evening
he
had
brought
with
him
from
lashio
a
large
quantity
of
supplies
and
lived
almost
as
well
as
he
could
have
done
at
home
although
the
days
were
very
warm
the
nights
were
cold
and
a
camp
fire
was
most
acceptable
captain
clive
was
on
excellent
terms
with
the
chinese
authorities
and
while
we
were
there
a
very
old
mandarin
blind
and
infirm
called
to
present
his
compliments
he
had
been
an
ardent
sportsman
and
was
especially
interested
in
our
guns
had
we
been
willing
to
accept
the
commission
he
would
have
paid
us
the
money
then
and
there
to
purchase
for
him
a
savage
rifle
like
the
one
we
were
carrying
the
old
gentleman
always
had
been
very
loyal
to
the
british
and
had
received
several
decorations
for
his
services
a
few
days
after
our
arrival
a
half
dead
chinaman
crawled
into
camp
with
his
throat
terribly
cut
he
had
been
attacked
by
brigands
only
a
few
miles
over
the
border
and
had
just
been
able
to
reach
the
company
compounder
took
him
in
charge
and
when
clive
asked
him
about
the
patient
his
evasive
answers
were
most
amusing
like
all
orientals
he
would
not
commit
himself
to
any
definite
statement
because
he
might
lose
face
if
his
opinion
proved
to
be
wrong
captain
clive
said
to
him
do
you
think
the
chinaman
will
die
looking
very
judicial
the
native
replied
sir
he
die
and
yet
he
may
live
but
said
clive
he
will
probably
die
wo
he
yes
was
the
answer
and
yet
perhaps
he
will
live
that
was
all
the
satisfaction
he
was
able
to
get
clive
told
us
of
another
native
who
formerly
had
been
in
his
company
he
had
been
transferred
and
one
day
the
captain
met
him
in
rangoon
when
asked
if
his
pay
was
satisfactory
the
answer
was
typical
sir
it
is
good
but
not
good
on
the
afternoon
of
our
fourth
day
in
a
heliograph
from
rangoon
announced
that
the
asiatic
zoölogical
expedition
of
the
american
museum
of
natural
history
is
especially
commended
to
his
majesty
indian
government
and
permission
is
hereby
granted
to
carry
on
its
work
in
burma
wherever
it
may
desire
this
was
only
one
of
the
many
courtesies
which
we
received
from
the
british
the
morning
following
the
receipt
of
the
heliogram
we
broke
camp
at
daylight
when
the
last
mule
of
the
caravan
had
disappeared
over
the
brown
hills
toward
china
we
regretfully
said
farewell
and
rode
away
if
we
are
ever
again
made
prisoners
of
war
we
hope
our
captor
will
be
as
delightful
a
gentleman
as
captain
clive
chapter
xxxiii
hunting
peacocks
on
the
salween
river
from
we
traveled
almost
due
north
to
the
salween
river
the
country
through
which
we
passed
was
a
succession
of
dry
treeless
hills
brown
and
barren
and
devoid
of
animal
life
on
the
evening
of
the
third
day
we
reached
the
salween
at
a
ferry
a
few
miles
from
the
village
of
changlung
where
the
river
begins
its
great
bend
to
the
eastward
and
sweeps
across
the
border
from
china
into
burma
the
stream
has
cut
a
tremendous
gorge
for
itself
through
the
mountains
and
the
sides
are
so
precipitous
that
the
trail
doubles
back
upon
itself
a
dozen
times
before
it
reaches
the
river
feet
below
the
upper
half
of
the
gorge
is
bare
or
thinly
patched
with
trees
but
in
the
lower
part
the
grass
is
long
and
rank
and
a
thin
dry
jungle
straggles
along
the
water
edge
the
salween
at
this
point
is
about
two
hundred
yards
wide
but
narrows
to
half
that
distance
below
the
ferry
and
flows
in
a
series
of
rapids
between
rocky
shores
the
valley
is
devoid
of
human
life
except
for
three
boatmen
who
tend
the
ferry
but
the
deserted
rice
fields
along
a
narrow
shelf
showed
evidence
of
former
cultivation
on
the
slopes
far
up
the
side
of
the
cañon
is
a
miao
village
a
tribe
which
we
had
not
seen
before
probably
the
valley
is
too
unhealthy
for
any
natives
to
live
close
to
the
water
edge
and
even
at
the
time
of
our
visit
in
early
march
the
heated
air
was
laden
with
malaria
the
ferrymen
were
stupid
fellows
half
drugged
with
opium
and
assured
us
that
there
were
no
mammals
near
the
river
they
admitted
that
they
sometimes
heard
peacocks
and
while
our
tents
were
being
pitched
on
a
steep
sand
bank
beneath
a
giant
tree
the
weird
catlike
call
of
a
peacock
echoed
up
the
valley
it
was
answered
by
another
farther
down
the
river
and
the
report
of
my
gun
when
i
fired
at
a
bat
brought
forth
a
wild
from
half
a
dozen
places
the
ferry
was
a
raft
built
of
long
bamboo
poles
lashed
together
with
vines
and
creepers
it
floated
just
above
the
surface
and
was
half
submerged
when
loaded
the
natives
used
a
most
extraordinary
contrivance
in
place
of
oars
it
consisted
of
a
piece
of
tightly
woven
bamboo
matting
three
feet
long
and
two
feet
wide
at
right
angles
to
which
was
fastened
a
handle
with
these
the
men
nonchalantly
raked
the
water
toward
them
from
the
bow
and
stem
when
they
had
poled
the
raft
well
into
the
current
the
invested
capital
was
not
extensive
for
when
the
ferry
or
propellers
needed
repairs
a
few
hours
work
in
the
jungle
sufficed
to
build
an
entirely
new
outfit
all
of
the
peacocks
were
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
river
from
our
camp
where
the
jungle
was
thickest
on
the
first
morning
my
wife
and
i
floated
down
the
river
on
the
raft
for
half
a
mile
and
landed
to
stalk
a
peacock
which
had
called
frequently
from
a
rocky
point
near
the
water
edge
we
picked
our
way
through
the
jungle
with
the
utmost
caution
but
the
wary
old
cock
either
saw
or
heard
us
before
we
were
within
range
and
i
caught
just
a
glimpse
of
a
brilliant
green
neck
as
he
disappeared
into
the
bushes
a
second
bird
called
on
a
point
a
half
mile
farther
on
but
it
refused
to
come
into
the
open
and
as
we
started
to
stalk
it
in
the
jungle
we
heard
a
patter
of
feet
among
the
dry
leaves
followed
by
a
roar
of
wings
and
saw
the
bird
sail
over
the
tree
tops
and
alight
on
the
summit
of
a
hill
this
was
the
only
peacock
which
we
were
ever
able
to
flush
when
it
had
already
gained
cover
usually
the
birds
depend
entirely
upon
their
ability
to
hide
or
run
through
the
bushes
after
several
attempts
we
learned
that
it
was
impossible
to
stalk
the
peacocks
successfully
the
jungle
was
so
crisp
and
parched
that
the
dry
leaves
crackled
at
every
step
and
even
small
birds
made
a
loud
noise
while
scratching
on
the
ground
the
only
way
to
get
the
peacocks
was
to
watch
for
them
at
the
river
when
they
came
to
drink
in
the
early
morning
and
evening
between
two
rocky
points
where
we
had
first
seen
the
birds
there
was
a
long
curved
beach
of
fine
white
sand
one
morning
heller
waited
on
the
point
nearest
camp
while
my
wife
and
i
posted
ourselves
under
a
bush
farther
down
the
river
we
had
been
sitting
quietly
for
half
an
hour
when
we
heard
a
scratching
in
the
jungle
thinking
it
was
a
peacock
feeding
we
turned
our
backs
to
the
water
and
sat
motionless
peering
beneath
the
bushes
meanwhile
heller
witnessed
an
interesting
little
drama
enacted
behind
us
an
old
male
peacock
with
a
splendid
train
stole
around
the
point
close
to
the
water
jumped
to
a
high
stone
within
thirty
yards
of
us
and
stood
for
a
full
minute
craning
its
beautiful
green
neck
to
get
a
better
view
as
we
kneeled
in
front
of
him
totally
unconscious
of
his
presence
after
he
had
satisfied
his
curiosity
he
hopped
off
the
observation
pinnacle
and
with
his
body
flattened
close
to
the
ground
slipped
quietly
away
it
was
an
excellent
example
of
the
stalker
being
stalked
and
had
heller
not
witnessed
the
scene
we
should
never
have
known
how
the
clever
old
bird
had
fooled
us
the
following
morning
we
got
a
peahen
at
the
same
place
heller
had
concealed
himself
in
the
bushes
on
one
side
of
the
point
while
i
watched
the
other
shortly
after
daylight
an
old
female
sailed
out
of
the
jungle
on
set
wings
and
alighted
at
the
water
edge
she
saw
heller
almost
instantly
although
he
was
completely
covered
by
the
vines
and
started
to
fly
but
he
dropped
her
with
a
broken
wing
recovering
herself
she
darted
around
the
rocky
point
only
to
meet
a
charge
of
from
my
gun
she
was
a
beautiful
bird
with
a
delicate
crown
of
slender
feathers
a
yellow
and
blue
face
patch
and
a
green
neck
and
back
but
her
plumes
were
short
and
inconspicuous
when
compared
with
those
of
the
male
probably
these
birds
had
never
before
been
hunted
but
they
were
exceedingly
shy
and
difficult
to
kill
although
they
called
more
or
less
during
the
entire
day
and
we
could
locate
them
exactly
they
were
so
far
back
in
the
jungle
that
the
crackling
of
the
dry
leaves
made
a
stalk
impossible
we
tried
to
drive
them
but
were
unsuccessful
for
the
birds
would
never
flush
unless
they
happened
to
be
in
the
open
and
cut
off
from
cover
apparently
realizing
that
their
brilliant
plumage
made
them
conspicuous
objects
the
birds
relied
entirely
upon
an
actual
screen
of
bushes
and
their
wonderful
sight
and
hearing
to
protect
themselves
from
enemies
they
usually
came
to
the
river
to
drink
very
early
in
the
morning
and
just
before
dusk
in
the
afternoon
but
on
cloudy
days
they
might
appear
at
almost
any
hour
if
undisturbed
they
would
remain
near
the
edge
for
a
considerable
time
or
strut
about
the
sand
beach
just
at
the
edge
of
the
jungle
at
the
sound
of
a
gun
or
any
other
loud
sharp
noise
the
peacocks
would
answer
with
their
mournful
catlike
wail
exactly
as
the
domesticated
birds
will
do
the
chinese
believe
that
the
flesh
of
the
peafowl
is
poison
and
our
servants
were
horrified
when
they
learned
that
we
intended
to
eat
it
they
fully
expected
that
we
would
not
survive
the
night
and
even
when
they
saw
we
had
experienced
no
ill
effects
they
could
not
be
persuaded
to
touch
any
of
it
themselves
an
old
peacock
is
too
tough
to
eat
but
the
younger
birds
are
excellent
and
when
stuffed
with
chestnuts
and
roasted
they
are
almost
the
equal
of
turkey
the
species
which
we
killed
on
the
salween
river
is
the
green
peafowl
which
inhabits
burma
sumatra
java
and
the
malay
peninsula
its
neck
is
green
instead
of
purple
as
is
that
of
the
common
indian
peacock
and
it
is
said
that
it
is
the
most
beautiful
bird
of
the
world
the
long
ocellated
tail
coverts
called
the
train
are
dropped
about
august
and
the
birds
assume
more
simple
barred
plumes
but
the
molt
is
very
irregular
usually
the
full
plumage
is
resumed
in
march
or
even
earlier
the
train
is
of
course
an
ornament
to
attract
the
female
and
when
a
cock
is
strutting
about
with
spread
plumes
he
sometimes
makes
a
most
peculiar
rustling
sound
by
vibrating
the
long
feathers
the
eight
or
ten
eggs
are
laid
on
the
bare
ground
under
a
bush
in
the
dense
jungle
are
dull
brownish
white
and
nearly
three
inches
long
the
chicks
are
sometimes
domesticated
but
even
when
born
in
captivity
it
is
said
they
are
difficult
to
tame
and
soon
wander
away
the
birds
are
omnivorous
feeding
on
insects
grubs
reptiles
flower
buds
young
shoots
and
grain
the
common
peafowl
is
a
native
of
india
ceylon
and
assam
it
is
held
sacred
by
some
religious
castes
and
we
saw
dozens
of
the
birds
wandering
about
the
grounds
of
the
temples
in
benares
agra
and
delhi
peafowl
are
said
to
be
rather
disagreeable
pets
because
they
often
attack
infirm
persons
and
children
and
kill
young
poultry
in
some
parts
of
ceylon
and
india
the
birds
are
so
abundant
and
easily
killed
that
they
do
not
furnish
even
passable
sport
but
in
other
places
they
are
as
wild
and
difficult
to
shoot
as
we
found
them
to
be
on
the
salween
river
in
india
it
is
a
universal
belief
among
sportsmen
that
wherever
peafowls
are
common
there
tiger
will
be
found
a
very
beautiful
variety
which
seems
to
have
arisen
abruptly
in
domestication
is
the
japanned
or
peacock
named
by
sclater
in
some
respects
it
is
intermediate
between
and
and
apparently
breeds
true
but
never
has
been
found
in
a
wild
state
albino
specimens
are
by
no
means
unusual
and
are
a
feature
of
many
zoölogical
gardens
peacocks
have
been
under
domestication
for
many
centuries
and
are
mentioned
in
the
bible
as
having
been
imported
into
palestine
by
solomon
although
the
bird
is
referred
to
in
mythology
the
greeks
probably
had
but
little
knowledge
of
it
until
after
the
conquests
of
alexander
in
the
thick
jungle
only
a
few
hundred
yards
from
our
camp
on
the
salween
river
i
put
up
a
silver
pheasant
one
of
the
earliest
known
and
most
beautiful
species
of
the
family
phasianidæ
its
white
mantle
delicately
vermiculated
with
black
extends
like
a
wedding
veil
over
the
head
back
and
tail
in
striking
contrast
to
the
underparts
red
cheek
patches
and
red
legs
this
bird
was
formerly
pictured
in
embroidery
upon
the
heart
and
back
badges
of
the
official
dresses
of
civil
mandarins
to
denote
the
rank
of
the
wearer
and
is
found
only
in
southern
and
western
china
it
is
by
no
means
abundant
in
the
parts
of
which
we
visited
and
moreover
lives
in
such
dense
jungle
that
it
is
difficult
to
find
the
natives
sometimes
snare
the
birds
and
offer
them
for
sale
alive
we
also
saw
monkeys
at
our
camp
on
the
salween
river
but
were
not
successful
in
killing
any
they
were
probably
the
indian
baboon
and
for
animals
which
had
not
been
hunted
were
most
extraordinarily
wild
they
were
in
large
herds
and
sometimes
came
down
to
the
water
to
skip
and
dance
along
the
sand
and
play
among
the
rocks
the
monkeys
invariably
appeared
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
river
from
us
and
by
the
time
we
hunted
up
the
boatmen
and
got
the
clumsy
raft
to
the
other
shore
the
baboons
had
disappeared
in
the
tall
grass
or
were
merrily
running
through
the
trees
up
the
the
valley
was
too
dry
to
be
a
very
productive
trapping
ground
for
either
small
or
large
mammals
but
the
birds
were
interesting
and
we
secured
a
good
many
species
new
to
our
collection
jungle
fowl
were
abundant
and
pigeons
exceedingly
so
but
we
saw
no
ducks
along
the
river
and
only
two
cormorants
very
few
natives
crossed
at
the
ferry
during
our
stay
for
it
is
a
long
way
from
the
main
road
and
the
climb
out
of
the
gorge
is
too
formidable
to
be
undertaken
if
the
salween
can
possibly
be
crossed
higher
up
where
the
valley
is
wide
and
shallow
while
we
were
camped
at
the
river
the
heat
was
most
uncomfortable
during
the
middle
of
the
day
and
was
but
little
mitigated
by
the
wind
which
blew
continually
during
the
valley
at
this
point
must
be
a
veritable
furnace
and
doubtless
reeks
with
fever
we
slept
under
nets
at
night
and
in
the
early
evening
while
we
were
watching
for
peacocks
the
mosquitoes
were
very
troublesome
chapter
xxxiv
the
gibbons
of
it
is
a
long
hard
climb
out
of
the
salween
valley
we
left
on
march
and
all
day
crawled
up
the
steep
sides
on
a
trail
which
doubled
back
and
forth
upon
itself
like
an
endless
letter
from
our
camp
at
night
the
river
was
just
visible
as
a
thin
green
line
several
thousand
feet
below
and
for
the
first
time
in
days
we
needed
a
charcoal
fire
in
our
tents
we
were
to
a
town
of
considerable
size
where
there
was
a
possibility
that
mail
might
be
awaiting
us
in
care
of
the
mandarin
although
ordinarily
a
three
days
journey
it
was
more
than
four
days
before
we
arrived
because
i
had
a
sharp
attack
of
malaria
shortly
after
leaving
the
salween
river
and
we
had
to
travel
half
stages
when
we
were
well
out
of
the
valley
and
at
an
altitude
of
feet
we
arrived
at
a
chinese
town
its
dark
houses
jammed
together
in
a
crowded
mass
and
the
filthy
streets
swarming
with
ragged
children
and
women
were
in
unpleasant
contrast
to
the
charming
little
shan
villages
which
we
had
seen
in
the
low
country
the
inhabitants
themselves
appeared
to
no
better
advantage
when
compared
with
their
shan
neighbors
for
their
stares
and
insolent
curiosity
were
almost
unbearable
the
region
between
the
salween
river
at
changlung
and
is
as
uninteresting
to
the
zoölogist
as
it
could
possibly
be
for
the
hills
are
dry
and
bare
and
devoid
of
animal
life
is
a
typical
chinese
town
except
that
the
streets
are
wide
and
it
is
not
as
dirty
as
usual
the
mandarin
was
a
jolly
rotund
little
fellow
who
simulated
great
sympathy
when
he
informed
me
that
he
had
received
no
mail
for
us
we
had
left
directions
to
have
a
runner
follow
us
from
and
in
the
event
that
he
did
not
find
our
camp
to
proceed
to
with
the
mail
we
learned
some
weeks
later
that
the
runner
had
been
frightened
by
brigands
and
had
turned
back
long
before
he
reached
we
had
heard
from
our
and
other
natives
that
black
monkeys
were
to
be
found
on
a
mountain
pass
not
far
from
the
village
of
on
the
main
road
and
as
we
were
certain
that
they
would
prove
to
be
gibbons
we
decided
to
make
that
our
next
hunting
camp
it
was
three
stages
from
and
toward
evening
of
the
second
day
we
again
descended
to
the
salween
river
the
valley
at
this
point
is
several
miles
wide
and
is
so
dry
that
the
few
shrubs
and
bushes
seem
to
be
parched
and
barely
able
to
live
at
the
upper
end
a
picturesque
village
is
set
among
extensive
rice
fields
although
a
few
chinese
live
there
its
inhabitants
are
chiefly
shans
who
are
in
a
transitory
state
and
are
gradually
adopting
chinese
customs
the
houses
are
joined
to
each
other
in
the
chinese
way
and
are
built
of
mud
thatched
with
straw
in
shape
as
well
as
in
composition
they
are
quite
unlike
the
dwellings
of
the
southern
shans
the
women
wore
cylindrical
turbans
about
eighteen
inches
high
which
at
a
distance
looked
like
silk
hats
and
the
men
were
dressed
in
narrow
trousers
and
jackets
of
chinese
blue
i
believe
that
some
of
the
shan
women
also
had
bound
feet
but
of
this
i
can
not
be
certain
we
camped
on
a
little
knoll
under
an
enormous
tree
at
the
far
end
of
the
village
street
and
a
short
time
after
the
tents
were
up
we
had
a
visit
from
the
shan
magistrate
he
was
a
dapper
energetic
little
fellow
wearing
foreign
dress
and
quite
with
foreign
ways
he
even
owned
a
shotgun
and
before
we
left
sent
to
ask
for
shells
he
presented
us
with
the
usual
chickens
and
i
returned
several
tins
of
cigarettes
he
appeared
to
be
quite
a
sportsman
and
directed
us
to
a
place
on
the
mountain
above
the
village
where
he
said
monkeys
were
abundant
we
left
early
in
the
morning
with
a
guide
and
after
a
hard
climb
arrived
at
a
little
village
near
the
forest
to
which
the
magistrate
had
directed
us
not
only
did
the
natives
assure
us
that
they
had
never
seen
monkeys
but
we
discovered
for
ourselves
that
the
only
water
was
more
than
a
mile
away
and
that
camping
there
was
out
of
the
question
the
next
day
april
we
went
on
to
it
is
a
tiny
village
built
into
the
with
hardly
fifty
yards
of
level
ground
about
it
but
commanding
a
magnificent
view
over
the
salween
valley
although
we
reached
there
at
half
past
two
in
the
afternoon
the
insisted
on
camping
because
they
swore
that
there
was
no
water
within
fifty
up
the
mountain
very
unwillingly
i
consented
to
camp
and
the
next
morning
found
as
usual
that
the
had
lied
for
there
was
a
splendid
camping
place
with
good
water
not
two
hours
from
it
was
useless
to
rage
for
the
chinese
have
no
scruples
about
honesty
in
such
small
matters
and
the
head
blandly
admitted
that
he
knew
there
was
a
camping
place
farther
on
but
that
he
was
tired
and
wanted
to
stop
early
as
we
gained
the
summit
of
the
ridge
we
were
greeted
with
a
ringing
from
the
forest
five
hundred
feet
below
us
they
were
the
calls
of
gibbons
without
a
doubt
but
strikingly
unlike
those
of
the
river
we
decided
to
camp
at
once
and
after
considerable
prospecting
chose
a
flat
place
beside
the
road
it
was
by
no
means
ideal
but
had
the
advantage
of
giving
us
an
opportunity
to
hunt
from
either
side
of
the
ridge
which
for
its
entire
length
was
scarcely
two
hundred
feet
in
width
the
sides
fell
away
for
thousands
of
feet
in
steep
slopes
and
as
far
as
our
eyes
could
reach
wave
after
wave
of
mountains
rolled
outward
in
a
great
sea
of
green
our
camp
would
have
been
delightful
except
for
the
wind
which
swept
across
the
pass
night
and
day
in
an
unceasing
gale
my
wife
and
i
set
a
line
of
traps
along
a
trail
which
led
down
the
north
side
of
the
ridge
while
heller
chose
the
opposite
slope
we
were
entranced
with
the
forest
the
trees
were
immense
spreading
giants
with
interlaced
branches
that
formed
a
solid
roof
of
green
feet
above
the
soft
moss
carpet
underneath
every
trunk
was
clothed
in
a
smothering
mass
of
vines
and
ferns
and
parasitic
plants
and
from
the
lower
branches
thousands
of
ropelike
creepers
swayed
back
and
forth
with
every
breath
of
wind
below
the
forest
was
fairly
open
save
for
occasional
patches
of
dwarf
bamboo
but
the
upper
canopy
was
so
close
and
dense
that
even
at
noon
there
was
hardly
more
than
a
somber
twilight
beneath
the
trees
our
first
night
on
the
pass
was
spent
in
a
terrific
gale
which
howled
up
the
valley
from
the
south
and
swept
across
the
ridge
in
a
torrent
of
wind
the
huge
trees
around
us
bent
and
tossed
and
our
tents
seemed
about
to
be
torn
to
shreds
amid
the
crashing
of
branches
and
the
roar
of
the
wind
it
was
impossible
to
hear
each
other
speak
and
sleep
was
out
of
the
question
we
lay
in
our
bags
expecting
every
second
to
have
the
covering
torn
from
above
our
heads
but
the
tough
cloth
held
and
at
midnight
the
gale
began
to
lull
in
the
morning
the
sun
was
out
in
a
cloudless
sky
but
the
wind
never
ceased
entirely
on
the
pass
even
though
there
was
a
breathless
calm
among
the
trees
a
few
hundred
feet
below
my
wife
and
i
had
just
returned
from
inspecting
our
line
of
traps
about
nine
in
the
morning
when
the
forest
suddenly
resounded
with
the
of
the
gibbons
it
seemed
a
long
way
off
at
first
but
sounded
louder
and
clearer
every
minute
at
the
first
note
we
seized
our
guns
and
dashed
down
the
slipping
stumbling
and
falling
the
animals
were
in
the
giant
forest
about
five
hundred
feet
below
the
summit
of
the
ridge
and
as
we
neared
them
we
moved
cautiously
from
tree
to
tree
going
forward
only
when
they
called
it
was
one
of
the
most
exciting
stalks
i
have
ever
made
for
the
wild
ringing
howls
seemed
always
close
above
our
heads
we
were
still
a
hundred
yards
away
when
a
huge
black
monkey
leaped
out
of
a
tree
top
just
as
i
stepped
from
behind
a
bush
and
he
saw
me
instantly
for
a
full
half
minute
he
hung
suspended
by
one
arm
his
round
head
thrust
forward
staring
intently
then
launching
himself
into
the
air
as
though
shot
from
a
catapult
he
caught
a
branch
twenty
feet
away
swung
to
another
and
literally
flew
through
the
tree
tops
without
a
sound
save
the
swish
of
the
branches
and
splash
after
splash
in
the
leaves
the
entire
herd
followed
him
down
the
hill
it
was
out
of
range
for
the
shotgun
and
my
wife
was
ten
feet
behind
me
with
the
rifle
but
had
i
had
it
in
my
hand
i
doubt
if
i
could
have
hit
one
of
those
flying
balls
of
fur
we
returned
to
camp
with
sorrow
in
our
hearts
but
two
days
later
we
redeemed
ourselves
and
brought
in
the
first
new
gibbons
we
were
sitting
on
a
bed
of
fragrant
pine
needles
watching
for
a
squirrel
which
had
been
chattering
in
the
upper
branches
of
a
giant
tree
when
suddenly
the
wild
call
of
the
monkeys
echoed
up
the
they
were
far
away
to
the
left
and
we
ran
toward
them
stumbling
and
slipping
on
the
rocks
and
logs
the
sounding
louder
every
moment
they
seemed
almost
under
us
at
times
and
we
would
stand
motionless
and
silent
only
to
hear
the
howls
die
away
in
the
distance
at
last
we
located
them
on
the
precipitous
side
of
a
deep
gorge
filled
with
an
impenetrable
jungle
of
palms
and
thorny
plants
it
was
an
impossible
place
to
cross
and
we
sat
down
irresolute
and
discouraged
in
a
few
moments
a
chorus
of
howls
broke
out
and
we
saw
the
big
black
apes
swinging
along
through
the
trees
two
hundred
yards
away
finally
they
stopped
and
began
to
feed
they
were
small
marks
at
that
distance
but
i
rested
my
little
mannlicher
on
a
stump
and
began
to
shoot
while
yvette
watched
them
with
the
glasses
one
big
fellow
swung
out
on
a
branch
and
hung
with
one
arm
while
he
picked
a
cluster
of
leaves
with
the
other
yvette
saw
my
first
shot
cut
a
twig
above
his
head
but
he
did
not
move
and
at
the
roar
of
the
second
he
dropped
heavily
into
the
vines
below
a
brown
female
ran
along
the
branch
a
few
seconds
later
and
peered
down
into
the
jungle
where
the
first
monkey
had
fallen
i
covered
her
carefully
with
the
ivory
head
of
the
front
sight
pulled
the
trigger
and
she
pitched
headlong
off
the
tree
for
a
few
seconds
there
was
silence
then
a
splash
of
leaves
and
three
huge
black
males
leaped
into
full
view
from
the
summit
of
a
tall
tree
they
were
silhouetted
against
a
patch
of
sky
and
i
fired
twice
in
quick
succession
registering
two
clean
misses
the
bullets
must
have
whizzed
too
close
for
comfort
and
they
faded
instantly
into
the
forest
like
three
black
shadows
for
ten
minutes
we
strained
our
eyes
into
the
dense
foliage
hoping
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
a
swaying
branch
suddenly
yvette
heard
a
rustling
in
the
low
tree
beneath
which
we
were
sitting
and
seized
me
violently
by
the
arm
screaming
excitedly
there
one
right
above
us
quick
quick
he
going
i
looked
up
and
could
hardly
believe
my
eyes
for
not
twenty
feet
away
hung
a
huge
brown
monkey
half
the
size
of
a
man
almost
in
a
daze
i
fired
with
the
shotgun
the
gibbon
stopped
slowly
pivoted
on
one
long
arm
and
a
pair
of
eyes
blazing
like
living
coals
stared
into
mine
i
fired
again
point
blank
as
the
huge
mouth
baring
four
ugly
fangs
opened
and
emitted
a
howl
the
monkey
slowly
swung
back
again
its
arm
relaxed
and
the
animal
fell
at
my
feet
stone
dead
it
was
a
magnificent
old
female
by
a
lucky
chance
we
had
chosen
from
all
the
trees
in
the
forest
to
sit
under
the
very
one
in
which
the
gibbon
had
been
hiding
and
she
had
tried
to
steal
away
unnoticed
while
my
wife
waited
to
direct
me
from
the
rim
of
the
gorge
i
climbed
down
into
the
jungle
to
try
and
make
my
way
up
the
opposite
side
where
the
other
monkeys
had
fallen
it
was
dangerous
work
for
the
rocks
were
covered
with
a
thin
layer
of
earth
which
supported
a
dense
growth
of
vegetation
if
i
tried
to
let
myself
down
a
steep
slope
by
clinging
to
a
thick
fern
it
would
almost
invariably
strip
away
with
a
long
layer
of
dirt
and
send
me
headlong
after
two
bad
falls
i
reached
the
bottom
of
the
ravine
where
a
mountain
torrent
leaped
and
foamed
over
the
rocks
and
dropped
in
a
beautiful
cascade
to
a
pool
fifty
or
sixty
feet
below
the
climb
up
the
opposite
side
was
more
difficult
than
the
descent
and
twice
i
had
to
return
after
finding
the
way
impassable
a
sheer
clean
wall
almost
seventy
feet
high
separated
me
from
the
spot
where
the
gibbons
had
fallen
i
skirted
the
rock
face
and
had
laboriously
worked
my
way
around
and
above
it
when
a
vine
to
which
i
had
been
clinging
stripped
off
and
i
began
to
slide
faster
and
faster
i
went
dragging
a
mass
of
ferns
and
creepers
with
me
for
everything
i
grasped
gave
way
i
thought
it
was
the
end
of
things
for
me
because
i
was
hardly
ten
feet
above
the
precipice
which
fell
away
to
the
jagged
rocks
of
the
stream
bed
in
a
drop
of
seventy
feet
the
rifle
slung
to
my
back
saved
my
life
suddenly
it
caught
on
a
tiny
ragged
ledge
and
held
me
flattened
out
against
the
cliff
but
even
then
i
was
far
from
safe
as
i
realized
when
i
tried
to
twist
about
to
reach
a
rope
of
creepers
which
swung
outward
from
a
bush
above
my
head
illustration
a
suspension
bridge
illustration
andrews
feeding
one
of
our
bear
cubs
how
i
managed
to
crawl
back
to
safety
among
the
trees
i
can
remember
only
vaguely
i
finally
got
down
to
the
bottom
of
the
cañon
but
felt
weak
and
sick
and
it
was
half
an
hour
before
i
could
climb
up
to
the
place
where
my
wife
was
waiting
she
was
already
badly
frightened
for
she
had
not
seen
me
since
i
left
her
an
hour
before
and
when
i
answered
her
call
she
was
about
to
follow
into
the
jungle
where
i
had
disappeared
we
left
the
two
monkeys
to
be
recovered
from
above
and
went
slowly
back
to
camp
the
gibbons
of
are
quite
unlike
those
of
the
river
they
represent
a
species
called
the
hoolock
which
is
also
found
in
burma
the
males
both
old
and
young
are
coal
black
with
a
fringe
of
white
hairs
about
the
face
and
the
females
are
light
brown
their
note
is
totally
unlike
the
river
gibbons
and
instead
of
sitting
quietly
in
the
top
of
a
dead
tree
to
call
to
their
neighbors
across
the
jungle
for
an
hour
or
two
the
hoolocks
howl
for
about
twenty
minutes
as
they
swing
through
the
branches
and
are
silent
during
the
remainder
of
the
day
they
called
most
frequently
on
bright
mornings
and
we
seldom
heard
them
during
cloudy
weather
apparently
they
had
regular
feeding
grounds
which
were
visited
every
day
but
the
herds
seemed
to
cover
a
great
deal
of
territory
like
the
gibbons
of
the
river
the
hoolocks
traveled
through
the
tree
tops
at
almost
unbelievable
speed
and
one
of
the
most
amazing
things
which
i
have
ever
witnessed
was
the
way
in
which
they
could
throw
themselves
from
one
tree
to
another
with
unerring
precision
on
april
we
received
the
first
mail
in
nearly
three
months
and
our
share
amounted
to
letters
besides
a
great
quantity
of
magazines
wu
had
ridden
to
for
us
and
as
well
as
the
greatly
desired
mail
had
a
basket
of
delicious
vegetables
and
a
sheaf
of
cablegrams
which
were
kindly
sent
by
palmer
and
abertsen
gentlemen
in
the
employ
of
the
chinese
customs
who
had
cared
for
our
mail
abertsen
also
sent
a
note
telling
us
of
a
good
hunting
ground
near
we
spent
an
entire
afternoon
and
evening
over
our
letters
and
papers
and
through
them
began
to
get
in
touch
with
the
world
again
it
is
strange
how
little
one
misses
the
morning
newspaper
once
one
is
beyond
its
reach
and
has
properly
adjusted
one
mental
perspective
and
it
is
just
as
strange
how
essential
it
all
seems
immediately
one
is
again
within
reach
of
such
adjuncts
of
civilization
on
april
we
had
the
first
rain
for
weeks
the
water
fell
in
torrents
and
the
roar
as
it
drummed
upon
the
tent
was
so
incessant
that
we
could
barely
hear
each
other
shout
because
of
the
long
dry
spell
our
camp
had
not
been
made
with
reference
to
weather
and
during
the
night
i
waked
to
find
that
we
were
in
the
middle
of
a
pond
with
fifteen
inches
of
water
in
the
tent
shoes
clothes
guns
and
cameras
were
soaked
and
the
surface
of
the
water
was
only
an
inch
below
the
bottoms
of
our
cots
this
was
the
beginning
of
a
ten
days
rain
after
which
we
had
six
weeks
of
as
delightful
weather
as
one
could
wish
chapter
xxxv
a
link
with
civilization
after
a
week
on
the
pass
above
we
shifted
camp
to
a
village
called
ten
miles
nearer
on
the
same
road
the
ride
along
the
summit
of
the
mountain
was
a
delight
for
we
passed
through
grove
after
grove
of
rhododendrons
in
full
blossom
the
trees
were
sometimes
thirty
feet
in
height
and
the
red
flowers
glowed
like
clusters
of
living
coals
among
their
dark
green
leaves
in
the
northern
part
of
the
rhododendrons
grow
above
other
timber
line
on
mountains
where
it
is
too
high
even
for
spruces
it
rained
continually
during
our
stay
at
i
had
another
attack
of
the
salween
malaria
and
for
five
or
six
days
could
do
little
work
heller
however
made
good
use
of
his
time
and
killed
a
beautiful
horned
pheasant
temminck
tragopan
besides
half
a
dozen
langurs
of
the
same
species
as
those
we
had
collected
on
the
river
he
also
was
fortunate
in
shooting
one
of
the
huge
flying
squirrels
which
we
had
hoped
to
get
at
he
saw
the
animal
in
the
upper
branches
of
a
dead
tree
on
the
first
evening
we
were
in
but
was
not
able
to
get
a
shot
the
next
night
he
watched
the
same
spot
and
killed
the
squirrel
with
a
charge
of
fours
it
measured
and
inches
from
the
nose
to
the
end
of
the
tail
and
was
a
rich
mahogany
red
grizzled
with
whitish
above
the
underparts
were
cream
white
as
in
all
flying
squirrels
the
four
legs
were
connected
by
a
sheet
of
skin
called
the
patagium
which
is
continuous
with
the
body
this
acts
as
a
parachute
and
enables
the
animal
to
sail
from
tree
to
tree
for
of
course
it
can
not
fly
like
a
bat
as
these
huge
squirrels
are
strictly
nocturnal
they
are
not
often
seen
even
by
the
natives
we
were
told
by
the
lutzus
on
the
mekong
river
that
by
building
huge
fires
in
the
woods
they
could
attract
the
animals
and
shoot
them
with
their
crossbows
a
few
weeks
later
we
purchased
a
live
flying
squirrel
from
a
native
and
kept
it
for
several
days
in
the
hope
that
it
might
become
tame
the
animal
was
exceedingly
savage
and
would
grind
its
teeth
angrily
and
spring
at
anyone
who
approached
its
basket
it
could
not
be
tempted
to
eat
or
drink
and
as
it
was
a
valuable
specimen
we
eventually
chloroformed
it
just
below
our
camp
in
a
pretty
little
valley
a
half
dozen
families
of
lisos
were
living
and
we
hired
the
men
to
hunt
for
us
they
were
fellows
as
all
the
natives
of
this
tribe
seem
to
be
and
worked
well
one
day
they
brought
in
a
fine
muntjac
buck
which
had
been
killed
with
their
crossbows
and
poisoned
darts
the
arrows
were
about
twelve
inches
long
made
of
bamboo
and
feathered
with
a
triangular
piece
of
the
same
wood
those
for
shooting
birds
and
squirrels
were
sharpened
to
a
needle
point
but
the
hunting
darts
were
tipped
with
steel
or
iron
the
poison
they
extracted
from
a
plant
which
i
never
saw
and
it
was
said
that
it
takes
effect
very
rapidly
the
muntjac
which
the
lisos
killed
had
been
shot
in
the
side
with
a
single
arrow
and
they
assured
us
that
only
the
flesh
immediately
surrounding
the
wound
had
been
spoiled
for
food
these
natives
like
the
mosos
lolos
and
others
carried
their
darts
in
a
quiver
made
from
the
leg
skin
of
a
black
bear
and
none
of
the
men
wished
to
sell
their
weapons
i
finally
did
obtain
a
crossbow
and
quiver
for
six
dollars
mexican
two
days
before
we
left
three
of
the
lisos
guided
my
wife
and
me
to
a
large
cave
where
they
said
there
was
a
colony
of
bats
the
cavern
was
an
hour
ride
from
camp
and
proved
to
be
in
a
difficult
and
dangerous
place
in
the
side
of
a
cliff
just
above
a
swift
mountain
stream
we
strung
our
gill
net
across
the
entrance
and
then
sent
one
of
the
natives
inside
to
stir
up
the
animals
while
we
caught
them
as
they
flew
out
in
less
than
half
an
hour
we
had
big
brown
bats
but
our
fingers
were
cut
and
bleeding
from
the
vicious
bites
of
their
teeth
they
all
represented
a
widely
distributed
species
which
we
had
already
obtained
at
fu
from
i
had
sent
a
runner
to
evans
at
fu
asking
him
to
forward
to
the
specimens
which
we
had
left
in
his
care
and
the
day
following
our
visit
to
the
bat
cave
the
caravan
bearing
our
cases
passed
us
at
we
ourselves
were
about
ready
to
leave
and
two
days
later
at
ten
in
the
morning
we
stood
on
a
precipitous
mountain
summit
gazing
down
at
the
beautiful
plain
which
lay
before
us
like
a
relief
map
it
is
as
flat
as
a
plain
well
can
be
and
except
where
a
dozen
or
more
villages
cluster
on
bits
of
dry
land
the
valley
is
one
vast
watery
rice
field
far
in
the
distance
outside
the
gray
city
walls
we
could
see
two
buildings
surrounded
by
compounds
and
wu
told
us
they
were
the
houses
of
the
customs
officials
although
only
given
the
rank
of
a
ting
or
chinese
city
is
one
of
the
most
important
places
in
the
province
for
it
stands
as
the
door
to
india
all
the
trade
of
burma
and
flows
back
and
forth
through
the
gates
of
over
the
great
caravan
road
to
bhamo
on
the
upper
irawadi
an
important
post
of
the
chinese
foreign
customs
which
are
administered
by
the
british
government
as
security
for
the
boxer
indemnity
is
situated
in
this
city
and
we
were
looking
forward
with
the
greatest
interest
to
meeting
its
white
population
at
the
time
of
our
visit
the
foreigners
included
fletcher
and
ralph
grierson
respectively
acting
commissioner
and
assistant
commissioner
of
customs
palmer
and
abertsen
also
of
the
customs
eastes
consul
chang
indian
medical
officer
and
reverend
and
embry
of
the
china
inland
mission
eastes
accompanied
by
the
resident
mandarin
was
absent
on
a
three
opium
inspection
tour
so
that
we
did
not
meet
him
we
reached
on
sunday
morning
and
camped
in
a
temple
outside
the
city
walls
immediately
after
tiffin
we
called
upon
grierson
and
went
with
him
to
the
customs
house
where
abertsen
and
palmer
were
living
we
found
there
a
scotch
botanist
forrest
an
old
traveler
in
who
was
to
on
a
expedition
for
an
english
commercial
firm
we
had
heard
much
of
forrest
from
kok
and
hanna
and
were
especially
glad
to
meet
him
because
of
his
wide
knowledge
of
the
northwestern
part
of
the
province
forrest
was
interested
chiefly
in
primroses
and
rhododendrons
i
believe
and
in
former
years
obtained
a
rather
remarkable
collection
of
these
plants
from
grierson
we
first
learned
that
the
united
states
had
declared
war
on
germany
it
had
been
announced
only
a
week
before
and
the
information
had
reached
by
cable
and
telegraph
almost
immediately
it
came
as
welcome
news
to
us
americans
who
had
been
vainly
endeavoring
to
justify
to
ourselves
and
others
our
lethargy
in
the
face
of
teuton
insolence
and
made
us
feel
that
once
again
we
could
acknowledge
our
nationality
with
the
pride
we
used
to
feel
on
monday
grierson
invited
us
to
become
his
guests
and
to
move
our
caravan
and
belongings
to
his
beautiful
home
we
were
charmed
with
it
and
our
host
the
house
was
built
with
upturned
gables
and
from
his
cool
verandah
we
could
look
across
an
exquisite
garden
to
the
blue
mountains
from
which
we
had
had
our
first
view
of
the
day
before
the
interior
of
the
dwelling
was
as
attractive
as
its
surroundings
and
the
beautifully
served
meals
were
as
varied
and
dainty
as
one
could
have
had
in
the
midst
of
a
great
city
like
all
britishers
the
customs
men
had
carried
their
sport
with
them
just
beyond
the
city
walls
an
excellent
golf
course
had
been
laid
out
with
chinese
graves
as
bunkers
and
there
was
a
cement
tennis
court
behind
the
commissioner
house
grierson
had
two
excellent
polo
ponies
besides
three
trained
pointer
dogs
and
riding
and
shooting
over
the
beautiful
hills
gave
him
an
almost
ideal
life
we
found
that
fletcher
had
a
really
remarkable
selection
of
records
and
an
excellent
victrola
after
dinner
as
we
listened
to
the
music
we
had
only
to
close
our
eyes
and
float
back
to
new
york
and
the
metropolitan
opera
house
on
the
divine
harmony
of
the
sextet

matchless
voice
but
none
of
us
wished
to
be
there
in
body
for
more
than
a
fleeting
visit
at
least
and
the
music
already
brought
with
it
a
lingering
sadness
because
our
days
in
the
free
wild
mountains
of
china
were
drawing
to
a
close
during
the
week
we
spent
with
grierson
we
dried
and
packed
all
our
specimens
in
boxes
which
were
purchased
from
the
agent
of
the
british
american
tobacco
company
in
they
were
just
the
right
size

carry
on

after
the
birds
and
mammals
had
been
wrapped
in
cotton
and
sprinkled
with

the
cases
were
soldered

made

tight
the
most
essential
thing
in
sending
specimens
of
any
kind
through
a
moist
tropical
climate
such
as
india
is
to
have
them
perfectly
dry
before
the
boxes
are

otherwise
they
will
arrive
at
their
destination
covered
with
mildew
and
absolutely
ruined
on
the
day
of
our
arrival
in
we
purchased
from
a
native
two
bear
cubs
about
a
week
old
each
was
coal
black
except
for
a
white
mark
on
the
breast
and
a
brown
nose
when
they
first
came
to
us
they
were
too
young
to
eat
and
we
fed
them
diluted
condensed
milk
from
a
spoon
the
little
chaps
were
as
playful
as
kittens
and
the
story
of
their
amusing
ways
as
they
grew
older
is
a
book
in
itself
after
a
month
one
of
the
cubs
died
leaving
great
sorrow
in
the
camp
the
other
not
only
lived
and
flourished
but
traveled
more
than
miles
he
went
with
us
on
a
pack
mule
to
bhamo
down
the
irawadi
river
to
rangoon
and
across
the
bay
of
bengal
to
calcutta
he
then
visited
many
cities
in
india
and
at
bombay
boarded
the
for
hongkong
and
became
the
pet
of
the
ship
from
china
we
took
him
to
japan
across
the
pacific
to
vancouver
and
finally
to
our
home
at
lawrence
park
bronxville
new
york
after
an
adventurous
career
as
a
house
pet
when
his
exploits
had
made
him
famous
and
ourselves
disliked
by
all
the
neighbors
we
regretfully
sent
him
to
the
national
zoölogical
park
washington
c
where
he
is
living
happily
at
the
present
time
he
was
the
most
delightful
little
pet
we
have
ever
owned
and
although
now
he
is
nearly
a
full
grown
bear
his
early
life
is
perpetuated
in
motion
pictures
and
we
can
see
him
still
as
he
came
to
us
the
first
week
he
might
well
have
been
the
model
for
the
original
teddy

chapter
xxxvi
a
big
game
paradise
a
few
months
previous
to
our
arrival
abertsen
had
discovered
a
splendid
hunting
ground
near
the
village
of
about
eighty
from
he
had
been
shooting
rabbits
and
pheasants
and
while
passing
through
the
village
the
natives
told
him
that
a
large
herd
of
or
wild
goats
lived
on
the
side
of
a
hill
through
which
a
branch
of
the
shweli
river
had
cut
a
deep
gorge
although
abertsen
was
decidedly
skeptical
as
to
the
accuracy
of
the
report
he
spent
two
days
hunting
and
with
his
shotgun
killed
two
gorals
moreover
he
saw
others
we
examined
the
two
skins
and
realized
at
once
that
they
represented
a
different
species
from
those
of
the
snow
mountain
therefore
when
we
left
our
first
camp
was
at
heller
and
i
started
with
four
natives
shortly
after
daylight
we
crossed
a
wooden
bridge
over
the
river
at
a
narrow
cañon
where
the
sides
were
straight
walls
of
rock
and
followed
down
the
gorge
for
about
two
miles
on
the
way
heller
who
was
in
front
saw
two
muntjac
standing
in
the
grass
on
an
open
hillside
and
shot
the
leader
the
deer
pitched
headlong
but
got
to
its
feet
in
a
few
moments
and
struggled
off
into
the
thick
cover
at
the
edge
of
the
meadow
it
had
disappeared
before
heller
reached
the
clearing
but
he
saw
the
second
deer
a
fine
doe
standing
on
a
rock
although
his
bullet
passed
through
both
lungs
the
animal
ran
a
quarter
of
a
mile
and
he
finally
discovered
her
several
hours
later
in
the
bushes
beside
the
river
in
a
short
time
we
reached
an
open
hillside
which
rose
six
or
seven
hundred
feet
above
the
river
in
a
steep
slope
the
opposite
side
was
a
sheer
wall
of
rock
bordered
on
the
rim
by
an
open
pine
forest
we
separated
at
this
point
heller
with
two
natives
keeping
near
the
river
while
i
climbed
up
the
hill
to
work
along
the
cliffs
half
way
to
the
summit
in
less
than
ten
minutes
heller
heard
a
loud
snort
and
looking
up
saw
three
gorals
standing
on
a
ledge
yards
above
him
he
fired
twice
but
missed
and
the
animals
disappeared
around
a
corner
of
the
hill
a
few
hundred
yards
farther
on
he
saw
a
single
old
ram
but
his
two
shots
apparently
had
no
effect
meanwhile
i
had
continued
along
the
hillside
not
far
from
the
summit
for
a
mile
or
more
without
seeing
an
animal
fresh
tracks
were
everywhere
and
trails
crossed
and
recrossed
among
the
rocks
and
grass
i
had
reached
an
impassable
precipice
and
was
returning
across
a
steep
slope
when
seven
gorals
jumped
out
of
the
grass
where
they
had
been
lying
asleep
i
was
in
a
thick
grove
of
pine
trees
and
fired
twice
in
quick
succession
as
the
animals
appeared
through
the
branches
but
missed
both
times
i
ran
out
from
the
trees
but
the
gorals
were
then
nearly
two
hundred
yards
away
one
big
ram
had
left
the
herd
and
was
trotting
along
broadside
on
i
aimed
just
in
front
of
him
and
pulled
the
trigger
as
his
head
appeared
in
the
peep
sight
he
turned
a
beautiful
somersault
and
rolled
over
and
over
down
the
hill
finally
disappearing
in
the
bushes
at
the
edge
of
the
water
the
other
gorals
had
disappeared
but
a
few
seconds
later
i
saw
a
small
one
slowly
skirting
the
rocks
on
the
very
summit
of
the
hill
the
first
shot
kicked
the
dirt
beside
him
but
the
second
broke
his
leg
and
he
ran
behind
a
huge
boulder
i
rested
the
little
mannlicher
on
the
trunk
of
a
tree
covering
the
edge
of
the
rock
with
the
ivory
head
of
the
front
sight
and
waited
i
was
perfectly
sure
that
the
goral
would
try
to
steal
out
and
in
two
or
three
minutes
his
head
appeared
i
fired
instantly
boring
him
through
both
shoulders
and
he
rolled
over
and
over
stone
dead
lodging
against
a
rock
not
fifty
yards
from
where
we
stood
the
two
natives
were
wild
with
excitement
and
yelling
at
the
top
of
their
lungs
ran
up
the
hill
like
goats
to
bring
the
animal
down
to
me
it
was
a
young
male
in
full
summer
coat
and
with
horns
about
two
inches
long
our
pleasure
was
somewhat
dampened
however
when
we
went
to
recover
the
first
goral
for
we
found
that
when
it
had
landed
in
the
grass
at
the
edge
of
the
river
it
had
either
rolled
or
crawled
into
the
water
we
searched
along
the
bank
for
half
a
mile
but
without
success
and
returned
to
just
in
time
for
tiffin
in
the
afternoon
we
shifted
camp
to
a
beautiful
little
grove
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
river
behind
the
hunting
grounds
heller
instead
of
going
over
with
the
caravan
went
back
along
the
rim
of
the
gorge
in
the
pine
forest
where
he
could
look
across
the
river
to
the
hill
on
which
we
had
hunted
in
the
morning
with
his
field
glasses
he
discovered
five
gorals
in
an
open
meadow
and
opened
fire
it
was
long
shooting
but
the
animals
did
not
know
which
way
to
run
and
he
killed
three
of
the
herd
before
they
disappeared
our
first
day
had
therefore
netted
us
one
deer
and
four
gorals
which
was
better
than
at
any
other
camp
we
had
had
in
china
we
realized
from
the
first
day
work
that
would
prove
to
be
a
wonderful
hunting
ground
and
the
two
weeks
we
spent
there
justified
all
our
hopes
at
other
places
the
cover
was
so
dense
or
the
country
so
rough
that
it
was
necessary
to
depend
entirely
upon
dogs
and
untrained
natives
but
here
the
animals
were
on
open
hillsides
where
they
could
be
still
hunted
with
success
moreover
we
had
an
opportunity
to
learn
something
about
the
habits
of
the
animals
for
we
could
watch
them
with
glasses
from
the
opposite
side
of
the
river
when
they
were
quite
unconscious
of
our
presence
there
was
only
one
day
of
our
stay
at
that
we
did
not
bring
in
one
or
more
gorals
and
even
after
we
had
obtained
an
unrivaled
series
dozens
were
left
shooting
the
animals
from
across
the
river
was
rather
an
unsportsmanlike
way
of
hunting
but
it
was
a
very
effective
method
of
collecting
the
particular
specimens
we
needed
for
the
museum
series
the
distance
was
so
great
that
the
gorals
were
unable
to
tell
from
where
the
bullets
were
coming
and
almost
any
number
of
shots
might
be
had
before
the
animals
made
for
cover
it
became
simply
a
case
of
long
range
target
shooting
at
seldom
less
than
three
hundred
yards
still
hunting
on
the
cliffs
was
quite
a
different
matter
however
and
was
as
good
sport
as
i
have
ever
had
the
rocks
and
open
meadow
slopes
were
so
precipitous
that
there
was
very
real
danger
every
moment
for
one
misstep
would
send
a
man
rolling
hundreds
of
feet
to
the
bottom
where
he
would
inevitably
be
killed
the
gorals
soon
learned
to
lie
motionless
along
the
sheerest
cliffs
or
to
hide
in
the
rank
grass
and
it
took
close
work
to
find
them
i
used
most
frequently
to
ride
from
camp
to
the
river
send
back
the
horse
by
a
and
work
along
the
face
of
the
rock
wall
with
my
two
native
boys
their
eyesight
was
wonderful
and
they
often
discovered
gorals
lying
among
the
rocks
when
i
had
missed
them
entirely
with
my
powerful
prism
binoculars
their
eyes
had
never
been
dimmed
by
study
and
i
suppose
were
as
keen
as
those
of
primitive
man
who
possibly
hunted
gorals
or
their
relatives
thousands
of
years
ago
over
these
same
hills
there
were
many
glorious
hunts
and
it
would
be
wearisome
were
i
to
describe
them
all
but
one
afternoon
stands
out
in
my
memory
above
the
others
it
was
a
brilliant
day
and
about
four
i
rode
away
from
camp
across
the
rice
fields
and
up
the
grassy
valley
to
the
long
sweep
of
open
meadow
on
the
rim
of
the
river
gorge
sending
back
the
horse
achi
my
native
hunter
and
i
crawled
carefully
to
a
jutting
point
of
rocks
and
lay
face
down
to
inspect
the
cliffs
above
and
to
the
left
with
my
glasses
i
scanned
every
inch
of
the
gray
wall
but
could
not
discover
a
sign
of
life
glancing
at
achi
i
saw
him
gazing
intently
at
the
rock
which
i
had
just
examined
and
in
a
moment
he
whispered
excitedly
by
putting
both
hands
to
the
side
of
his
head
he
indicated
that
the
animal
was
lying
down
and
although
he
pointed
with
my
rifle
it
was
full
five
minutes
before
i
could
discover
the
goral
flat
upon
his
belly
against
the
cliff
with
head
stretched
out
and
fore
legs
doubled
beneath
his
body
he
was
sound
asleep
in
the
sun
and
looked
as
though
he
might
remain
forever

achi
indicated
that
we
were
to
climb
up
above
and
circle
around
the
cliff
to
a
ragged
promontory
which
jutted
into
space
within
a
hundred
yards
of
the
animal
it
was
a
good
three
quarters
of
an
hour
before
we
peered
cautiously
between
two
rocks
opposite
the
ledge
where
the
goral
had
been
asleep
the
animal
was
gone
we
looked
at
each
other
in
blank
amazement
and
then
began
a
survey
of
the
ground
below
halfway
down
the
achi
discovered
the
ram
feeding
in
an
open
meadow
and
we
began
at
once
to
make
our
way
down
the
face
of
the
cliff
it
was
dangerous
going
but
we
gained
the
meadow
in
safety
and
worked
cautiously
up
to
a
grassy
ridge
where
the
goral
had
been
standing
again
we
crawled
like
snakes
among
the
rocks
and
again
an
empty
slope
of
waving
grass
met
our
eyes
the
goral
had
disappeared
and
even
achi
could
not
discover
a
sign
of
life
upon
the
meadow
with
an
exclamation
of
disgust
i
got
to
my
feet
and
looked
around
instantly
there
was
a
rattle
of
stones
and
a
huge
goral
leaped
out
of
the
grass
thirty
yards
away
and
dashed
up
the
hill
i
threw
up
my
rifle
and
shot
hurriedly
chipping
a
bit
of
rock
a
foot
behind
the
animal
swearing
softly
at
my
carelessness
i
threw
in
another
shell
selected
a
spot
in
front
of
the
ram
and
fired
the
splendid
animal
sank
in
its
tracks
without
a
quiver
shot
through
the
base
of
the
neck
i
had
just
ejected
the
empty
shell
when
achi
seized
me
by
the
arm
whispering
na
na
na
and
pointing
to
the
cliffs
two
hundred
yards
above
us
i
looked
up
just
in
time
to
see
another
goral
flash
behind
a
rock
on
the
very
summit
of
the
ridge
an
instant
later
he
appeared
again
and
stopped
broadside
on
with
his
noble
head
thrown
up
silhouetted
against
the
sky
it
was
a
perfect
target
and
resting
my
rifle
on
a
flat
rock
i
covered
the
animal
with
the
white
bead
and
centered
it
in
the
rear
sight
as
i
touched
the
hair
trigger
and
the
roar
of
the
shell
crashed
back
from
the
face
of
the
cliff
the
animal
leaped
with
legs
straight
out
whirling
over
and
over
down
the
meadow
and
bringing
up
against
a
boulder
not
twenty
yards
from
the
first
goral
that
night
as
i
walked
over
the
hills
in
the
cool
dusk
i
would
not
have
changed
my
lot
with
any
man
on
earth
the
breathless
excitement
of
the
stalk
and
the
wild
thrill
of
exultation
at
the
clean
kill
of
two
splendid
rams
were
still
rioting
in
my
veins

serow
and
sambur
we
had
a
delightful
visit
from
grierson
during
our
first
week
in
camp
he
rode
out
on
thursday
afternoon
and
remained
until
sunday
bringing
us
mail
war
news
and
fresh
vegetables
and
returning
with
goral
meat
for
all
the
foreigners
in
on
the
afternoon
of
his
visit
i
had
killed
three
monkeys
which
represented
a
different
species
from
any
we
had
obtained
before
they
were
the
indian
baboon
and
were
probably
like
those
of
the
salween
river
at
changlung
i
found
two
great
troupes
of
the
monkeys
running
along
the
opposite
river
bank
the
first
herd
was
climbing
up
the
almost
perpendicular
rock
walls
swinging
on
the
bushes
and
sometimes
almost
disappearing
in
the
tufts
of
grass
i
could
not
approach
nearer
than
one
hundred
and
fifty
yards
and
did
some
very
bad
shooting
at
the
little
beasts
but
a
running
monkey
at
that
distance
is
a
pretty
uncertain
mark
and
it
requires
a
much
better
shot
than
i
am
to
register
more
hits
than
misses
i
did
kill
two
but
both
dropped
into
the
river
and
promptly
sank
so
that
i
gave
it
up
less
than
a
half
mile
farther
on
another
and
larger
troupe
appeared
among
the
boulders
just
at
the
water
edge
profiting
by
my
experience
i
kept
out
of
sight
among
the
bushes
and
watched
the
animals
play
about
until
one
hopped
to
a
rock
and
sat
quietly
for
an
instant
i
got
six
in
this
way
but
we
were
able
to
recover
only
three
of
them
from
the
water
heller
shot
three
muntjac
at
besides
the
doe
which
he
killed
on
the
first
day
one
of
the
largest
bucks
had
a
pair
of
beautiful
antlers
three
and
one
half
inches
long
from
the
burr
to
the
tip
the
projections
or
pedicels
of
the
frontal
bone
from
the
summits
of
which
the
antlers
grow
measured
two
and
inches
from
the
skull
to
the
burrs
evidently
the
muntjac
are
somewhat
irregular
in
shedding
for
although
they
were
all
in
full
summer
pelage
two
already
had
lost
their
antlers
while
the
other
had
not
i
can
think
of
no
more
delicious
meat
than
the
flesh
of
these
little
deer
and
they
seem
to
be
as
highly
esteemed
by
the
english
sportsmen
of
india
as
they
are
by
the
foreigners
of
china
i
did
not
see
a
muntjac
while
at
but
was
fortunate
in
killing
a
splendid
serow
which
represents
a
subspecies
new
to
science
although
the
natives
said
that
serow
were
known
to
occur
in
the
thick
jungle
on
the
south
side
of
the
river
none
had
been
seen
for
years
heller
and
i
had
gone
to
this
part
of
the
gorge
to
hunt
for
a
troupe
of
monkeys
which
he
had
located
on
the
previous
day
we
had
separated
heller
keeping
close
to
the
water
while
i
skirted
the
cliffs
near
the
summit
not
far
from
the
road
which
led
through
the
pine
forest
i
was
walking
just
under
the
rim
of
the
gorge
when
suddenly
with
a
snort
a
large
animal
dashed
out
of
a
thicket
below
and
to
the
left
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
great
body
and
a
pair
of
short
curved
horns
as
the
beast
disappeared
in
a
shallow
gully
and
realized
that
it
was
a
serow
a
few
seconds
later
it
reappeared
running
directly
away
from
me
along
the
upper
edge
of
the
gorge
i
fired
and
the
animal
dropped
gave
a
convulsive
twist
rolled
over
and
plunged
into
the
cañon
as
the
serow
disappeared
we
heard
a
chorus
of
excited
yells
from
below
and
it
was
evident
that
some
natives
near
the
water
had
seen
it
fall
i
had
slight
hope
that
they
might
have
rescued
it
from
the
river
but
my
heart
was
heavy
as
we
worked
along
the
cliff
trying
to
find
a
place
where
it
was
possible
to
descend
a
wood
cutter
whom
we
discovered
a
short
distance
away
guided
us
down
a
trail
so
steep
that
it
seemed
impossible
for
a
human
being
to
walk
along
it
and
in
proof
i
slid
the
last
half
of
the
way
to
the
rocks
at
the
river
edge
narrowly
escaping
a
broken
neck
when
we
reached
the
stream
it
was
only
to
find
a
flat
wall
against
which
the
water
surged
in
a
mass
of
white
foam
separating
us
from
the
place
where
the
serow
had
fallen
i
tried
to
wade
around
the
rock
but
in
two
steps
the
water
was
above
my
waist
it
was
evident
that
we
would
have
to
swim
and
i
began
to
undress
inviting
achi
and
the
wood
cutter
to
follow
the
former
refused
but
the
latter
pulled
off
his
few
clothes
with
considerable
hesitation
it
was
a
swim
of
only
about
forty
feet
around
the
face
of
the
cliff
but
the
current
was
strong
and
it
was
no
easy
matter
to
fight
my
way
to
the
other
side
after
i
had
climbed
out
upon
the
rocks
i
called
to
the
wood
cutter
to
follow
and
he
slipped
into
the
water
evidently
the
current
was
more
than
he
had
bargained
for
and
a
look
of
fear
crossed
his
face
but
he
went
manfully
at
it
he
had
almost
reached
the
rock
on
which
i
was
standing
with
outstretched
hand
when
his
strength
seemed
suddenly
to
go
and
he
cried
out
in
terror
i
jumped
into
the
water
hanging
to
the
rocks
with
one
hand
and
letting
my
legs
float
out
behind
the
wood
cutter
just
managed
to
reach
my
big
toe
to
which
he
clung
as
if
it
had
in
reality
been
the
straw
of
the
drowning
man
and
i
dragged
him
up
stream
until
to
my
intense
relief
he
could
grasp
the
rocks
we
picked
our
way
among
the
boulders
for
a
few
yards
and
suddenly
came
upon
the
serow
lying
partly
in
the
water
i
felt
like
dancing
with
delight
but
the
sharp
rocks
were
not
conducive
to
any
such
demonstrations
and
i
merely
yelled
to
achi
who
understood
from
the
tone
if
not
from
my
words
that
the
animal
was
safe
the
men
who
had
shouted
when
the
animal
fell
over
the
cliff
were
only
fifty
feet
away
but
they
too
were
separated
from
it
by
a
wall
of
rock
and
surging
water
they
said
that
there
was
an
easier
way
up
the
cliff
than
the
one
by
which
we
had
descended
and
prepared
a
line
of
tough
vines
one
end
of
which
they
let
down
to
us
we
made
it
fast
to
the
serow
and
i
kept
a
second
vine
rope
in
my
hands
swimming
beside
the
animal
as
they
dragged
it
to
the
other
shore
it
was
landed
safely
and
the
wood
cutter
was
hauled
over
by
the
same
means
i
had
intended
to
swim
back
for
my
clothes
but
discovered
that
achi
had
disappeared
taking
my
garments
and
those
of
the
wood
cutter
with
him
he
evidently
intended
to
meet
us
on
the
hilltop
but
it
left
us
in
the
rather
awkward
predicament
of
making
our
way
through
the
thick
brush
with
only
the
proverbial
smile
and
minus
even
the
necktie
the
men
fastened
together
the
serow
four
legs
slipped
a
pole
beneath
them
and
toiled
up
the
steep
slope
preceded
by
a
naked
brown
figure
and
followed
by
a
white
one
the
side
of
the
gorge
was
covered
with
vines
and
creepers
many
of
them
thorny
and
pushing
through
them
with
no
bodily
protection
was
far
from
comfortable
when
we
arrived
at
the
road
on
the
rim
of
the
gorge
i
was
dismayed
to
find
that
achi
was
not
there
with
my
clothes
the
wood
cutter
did
not
appear
to
be
greatly
worried
and
indicated
that
we
would
find
him
farther
up
the
road
i
walked
on
dubiously
expecting
every
second
to
meet
some
person
and
sure
enough
a
chinese
woman
suddenly
appeared
over
a
little
hill
i
dived
into
the
tall
ferns
beside
the
road
burrowing
like
a
rabbit
and
from
the
frightened
way
in
which
she
hurried
past
she
must
have
thought
she
had
seen
one
of
her
ancestral
spirits
stalking
abroad
we
eventually
found
the
boy
and
decently
dressed
i
faced
the
world
again
with
confidence
and
happiness
on
the
way
back
to
camp
we
saw
a
goral
on
the
cliffs
across
the
river
it
was
high
up
and
fully
three
hundred
and
fifty
yards
away
but
of
course
quite
unconscious
of
our
presence
my
first
two
shots
struck
close
beside
the
animal
but
at
the
third
it
rolled
over
and
over
down
the
hill
lodging
among
the
rocks
just
above
the
river
our
entry
into
camp
was
triumphal
for
fully
half
the
village
acted
as
an
escort
to
the
serow
an
animal
which
few
had
ever
seen
it
was
a
female
and
probably
weighed
about
two
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
the
mane
was
short
and
black
and
strikingly
unlike
the
long
white
manes
of
the
snow
mountain
serows
the
horns
were
almost
smooth
getting
this
specimen
was
one
of
the
lucky
chances
which
sometimes
come
to
a
sportsman
for
one
might
hunt
for
weeks
in
the
same
place
without
ever
seeing
another
serow
as
the
jungle
is
exceedingly
dense
and
the
cliffs
so
steep
that
it
is
impossible
to
walk
except
in
a
few
spots
the
animal
had
been
feeding
on
the
new
grass
just
at
the
edge
of
the
heavy
cover
and
probably
had
been
sleeping
under
a
bush
when
she
was
disturbed
besides
mammals
and
birds
we
made
a
fairly
good
collection
of
reptiles
and
lizards
at
but
in
all
other
parts
of
the
province
which
we
visited
they
were
exceedingly
scarce
in
fact
i
have
never
been
in
a
place
where
there
were
so
few
reptiles
and
batrachians
we
obtained
only
one
species
of
poisonous
snake
here
it
was
a
small
green
viper
which
we
sometimes
saw
coiled
on
a
low
bush
watching
mouse
holes
in
the
grass
several
species
of
nonpoisonous
snakes
were
more
common
but
were
nowhere
really
abundant
we
left
the
day
after
i
killed
the
serow
for
a
village
called
where
there
was
a
report
of
sambur
none
of
us
had
any
real
hope
of
finding
the
huge
deer
after
our
former
unsuccessful
hunts
but
we
camped
in
the
early
afternoon
on
an
open
hilltop
five
miles
from
where
the
natives
assured
us
the
animals
often
came
to
eat
the
young
rice
during
the
night
we
engaged
four
men
with
three
dogs
as
hunters
but
awoke
to
find
a
dense
fog
blanketing
the
valley
and
mountains
it
was
not
until
half
past
nine
that
the
gray
mist
yielded
to
the
sun
and
left
the
hills
clear
enough
for
us
to
hunt
we
climbed
a
wooded
ridge
directly
behind
the
camp
and
skirted
the
edge
of
a
heavily
forested
ravine
which
the
men
wished
to
drive
heller
took
a
position
in
a
bean
field
while
i
climbed
to
a
sharp
ridge
above
and
beyond
him
in
less
than
half
an
hour
the
dogs
began
to
yelp
in
an
uncertain
way
i
saw
one
of
them
running
down
hill
nose
to
the
ground
and
a
few
seconds
later
heller
fired
twice
in
quick
succession
two
sambur
had
skirted
the
edge
of
the
wood
less
than
one
hundred
yards
away
but
he
had
missed
with
both
shots
the
trail
led
into
a
deep
ravine
filled
with
dense
underbrush
in
a
few
moments
the
dogs
began
to
yelp
again
and
while
heller
remained
on
the
hillside
to
watch
the
open
fields
i
followed
the
hounds
along
the
creek
bed
suddenly
the
whiplike
crack
of
his
savage
rifle
sounded
five
times
in
quick
succession
just
above
our
heads
and
we
climbed
hurriedly
out
of
the
gorge
heller
shouted
that
he
had
fired
at
a
huge
sambur
running
along
the
edge
of
a
bean
field
but
the
animal
showed
no
sign
of
being
hit
we
easily
picked
up
the
trail
in
the
soft
earth
and
in
a
few
moments
found
several
drops
of
blood
showing
that
at
least
one
bullet
had
found
its
mark
the
blood
soon
ceased
and
we
began
to
wonder
if
the
sambur
had
not
been
merely
scratched
heller
had
seen
the
deer
disappear
in
a
second
ravine
a
branch
of
the
one
out
of
which
it
had
first
been
driven
and
while
he
watched
the
upper
side
i
worked
my
way
to
the
bottom
to
look
for
tracks
a
few
moments
later
the
natives
began
to
shout
excitedly
just
above
me
and
heller
called
out
that
they
had
found
the
deer
which
was
lying
stone
dead
half
way
down
the
side
of
the
gorge
in
a
mass
of
thick
ferns
the
sambur
had
been
hit
only
once
but
the
powerful
savage
bullet
had
crashed
through
the
shoulder
into
the
lungs
it
was
quite
sufficient
to
do
the
work
even
on
such
a
huge
animal
and
the
deer
had
run
less
than
one
hundred
yards
from
the
place
where
it
had
been
shot
it
was
a
splendid
male
carrying
a
magnificent
pair
of
antlers
which
measured
inches
in
length
the
deer
was
about
the
size
of
an
american
wapiti
or
elk
and
must
have
weighed
at
least
seven
hundred
pounds
for
it
required
eight
men
to
lift
it
the
chinese
hunters
were
wild
with
excitement
but
especially
so
when
we
began
to
eviscerate
the
animal
for
they
wished
to
save
the
blood
which
is
considered
of
great
medicinal
value
they
filled
caps
sacks
bamboo
joints
and
every
receptacle
which
they
could
find
after
each
man
had
drunk
all
he
could
possibly
force
down
his
throat
and
had
eaten
the
huge
clots
which
choked
the
thorax
when
the
sambur
was
brought
to
camp
a
regular
orgy
was
held
by
our
servants
and
dozens
of
villagers
who
gathered
to
buy
beg
or
steal
some
of
the
blood
our
interpreter
wu
took
the
heart
as
his
perquisite
carefully
extracted
the
blood
and
dried
it
in
a
basin
the
liver
also
seemed
to
be
an
especial
desideratum
and
in
fact
every
part
of
the
viscera
was
saved
because
the
antlers
were
hard
they
were
not
considered
of
especial
value
but
had
they
been
in
the
velvet
we
should
have
had
to
guard
them
closely
then
they
would
have
been
worth
about
one
hundred
dollars
mexican
we
expected
from
our
easy
hunt
of
the
morning
that
it
would
not
be
difficult
to
get
sambur
and
indeed
heller
did
see
another
in
the
afternoon
but
failed
to
kill
it
unfortunately
a
relative
of
one
of
the
hunters
died
suddenly
during
the
night
and
all
the
men
went
off
with
their
dogs
to
the
burial
feast
which
lasted
several
days
and
we
were
not
able
to
find
any
other
good
hounds
illustration
a
mountain
chair
illustration
the
waterfall
at
there
were
undoubtedly
several
sambur
in
the
vicinity
of
our
camp
but
they
fed
entirely
during
the
night
and
spent
the
day
in
such
thick
cover
that
it
was
impossible
to
drive
them
out
except
with
good
beaters
or
dogs
we
hunted
faithfully
every
morning
and
afternoon
but
did
not
get
another
shot
and
after
a
week
moved
camp
to
the
base
of
a
great
mountain
range
six
miles
away
near
a
liso
village
the
scenery
in
this
region
is
magnificent
the
mountain
range
is
the
same
on
which
we
hunted
at
and
reaches
a
height
of
feet
near
it
is
wild
and
uninhabited
and
the
splendid
forests
must
shelter
a
good
deal
of
game
the
foothills
on
which
we
were
camped
are
low
wooded
ridges
rising
out
of
open
cultivated
valleys
which
often
run
into
the
ravines
in
which
the
sambur
sleep
why
the
deer
should
occur
in
this
particular
region
and
not
in
the
neighboring
country
is
a
mystery
unless
it
is
the
proximity
of
the
great
forested
mountain
range
but
in
similar
places
only
a
few
miles
away
where
there
is
an
abundance
of
cover
the
natives
said
the
animals
had
never
been
seen
and
neither
were
they
known
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
mountain
range
where
the
fu
road
crosses
the
salween
valley
on
may
we
started
back
to
to
spend
three
or
four
days
hunting
monkeys
before
we
returned
to
to
pack
our
specimens
and
end
the
field
work
of
the
expedition
on
the
way
my
wife
and
i
became
separated
from
the
caravan
but
as
we
had
one
of
our
servants
for
a
guide
we
were
not
uneasy
the
man
was
a
lazy
stupid
fellow
named
le
which
we
had
changed
to
leaping
frog
because
he
never
did
leap
for
any
cause
whatever
and
before
long
he
had
us
hopelessly
lost
it
would
appear
easy
enough
to
ask
the
way
from
the
natives
but
the
chinese
are
so
suspicious
that
they
often
will
intentionally
misdirect
a
stranger
they
do
not
know
what
business
the
inquirer
may
have
in
the
village
to
which
he
wishes
to
go
and
therefore
just
on
general
principles
they
send
him
off
in
the
wrong
direction
apparently
this
is
what
happened
to
us
for
a
farmer
of
whom
we
inquired
the
way
directed
us
to
a
road
at
nearly
right
angles
to
the
one
we
should
have
taken
and
it
was
late
in
the
afternoon
before
we
finally
found
the
caravan
chapter
xxxviii
last
days
in
china
it
was
of
paramount
importance
to
pack
our
specimens
before
the
beginning
of
the
summer
rains
they
might
be
expected
to
break
in
full
violence
any
day
after
june
and
when
they
really
began
it
would
be
impossible
to
get
our
boxes
to
bhamo
for
virtually
all
caravan
travel
ceases
during
the
wet
season
therefore
our
second
stay
at
was
short
and
we
returned
to
on
may
ending
the
active
field
work
of
the
expedition
exactly
a
year
from
the
time
it
began
with
our
trip
up
the
min
river
to
in
fukien
province
grierson
had
kindly
invited
us
again
to
become
his
guests
and
no
place
ever
seemed
more
delightful
after
our
hot
and
dusty
ride
than
his
beautiful
garden
and
cool
shady
verandah
where
a
dainty
tea
was
served
our
days
in
were
busy
ones
for
after
the
specimens
were
packed
and
the
boxes
sealed
it
was
necessary
to
wrap
them
in
waterproof
covers
moreover
the
equipment
had
to
be
sorted
and
sold
or
discarded
a
caravan
engaged
and
nearly
a
thousand
feet
of
film
developed
this
was
done
in
the
spacious
dark
room
connected
with
grierson
house
which
offered
a
welcome
change
from
the
cramped
quarters
of
the
tent
which
we
had
used
for
so
many
months
much
of
the
success
of
our
motion
film
lay
in
the
fact
that
it
was
developed
within
a
short
time
after
exposure
for
had
we
attempted
to
bring
or
send
it
to
shanghai
the
nearest
city
with
facilities
for
doing
such
work
it
would
inevitably
have
been
ruined
by
the
climatic
changes
although
cinematograph
photography
requires
an
elaborate
and
expensive
outfit
and
is
a
source
of
endless
work
nevertheless
the
value
of
an
actual
moving
record
of
the
life
of
such
remote
regions
is
worth
all
the
trouble
it
entails
the
paget
natural
color
plates
proved
to
be
eminently
satisfactory
and
were
among
the
most
interesting
results
of
the
expedition
the
stereoscopic
effects
and
the
faithful
reproduction
of
the
delicate
atmospheric
shading
in
the
photographs
are
remarkable
although
the
plates
had
been
subjected
to
a
variety
of
climatic
conditions
and
temperatures
by
the
time
the
last
ones
were
exposed
in
burma
a
year
and
a
half
after
their
manufacture
they
showed
no
signs
of
deterioration
even
when
the
ordinary
negatives
which
we
brought
with
us
from
america
had
been
ruined
the
other
photographs
some
of
which
are
reproduced
in
this
book
speak
for
themselves
the
entire
collections
of
the
expedition
were
packed
in
cases
and
included
the
following
specimens
mammals
birds
reptiles
and
batrachians
skeletons
and
formalin
preparations
for
anatomical
study
paget
natural
color
plates
photographic
negatives
feet
of
film
since
the
expedition
was
organized
primarily
for
the
study
of
the
mammalian
fauna
and
its
distribution
our
efforts
were
directed
very
largely
toward
this
branch
of
science
and
other
specimens
were
gathered
only
when
conditions
were
especially
favorable
i
believe
that
the
mammal
collection
is
the
most
extensive
ever
taken
from
china
by
a
single
continuous
expedition
and
a
large
percentage
undoubtedly
will
prove
to
represent
species
new
to
science
our
tents
were
pitched
in
different
spots
from
feet
to
feet
above
sea
level
and
because
of
this
range
in
altitudes
the
fauna
represented
by
our
specimens
is
remarkably
varied
moreover
during
our
nine
months
in
we
spent
days
in
the
saddle
riding
miles
on
horse
or
mule
back
largely
over
small
roads
or
trails
in
little
known
parts
of
the
province
in
we
were
entertained
most
hospitably
and
the
leisure
hours
were
made
delightful
by
golf
tennis
riding
and
dinners
grierson
was
a
charming
host
who
placed
himself
as
well
as
his
house
and
servants
at
our
disposal
utter
strangers
though
we
were
and
we
shall
never
forget
his
welcome
we
decided
to
take
four
to
bhamo
because
of
the
rain
which
was
expected
every
day
and
the
coolies
made
us
very
comfortable
upon
our
sleeping
bags
which
were
swung
between
two
bamboo
poles
and
covered
with
a
strip
of
yellow
they
were
the
regulation
chinese
mountain
schooner
at
which
we
had
so
often
laughed
but
they
proved
to
be
infinitely
more
desirable
than
riding
in
the
rain
with
the
cases
of
specimens
we
left
on
june
behind
a
caravan
of
thirty
mules
for
the
journey
to
bhamo
on
the
outskirts
of
civilization
our
were
miserable
specimens
of
humanity
they
were
from
province
and
were
all
unmarried
which
alone
is
almost
a
crime
in
china
every
cent
of
money
earned
by
the
hardest
sort
of
work
they
spent
in
drinking
gambling
and
smoking
opium
as
wu
tersely
put
it
they
make
how
much
spend
how
much
about
every
two
hours
they
would
deposit
us
unceremoniously
in
the
midst
of
a
filthy
village
and
disappear
into
some
dark
den
in
spite
of
our
remonstrances
we
would
grumble
and
fume
and
finally
getting
out
of
our
chairs
peer
into
the
hole
in
the
half
light
we
would
see
them
huddled
on
a
kang
over
tiny
yellow
flames
sucking
at
their
pipes
at
tiffin
each
one
would
stretch
out
under
a
tree
with
a
stone
for
a
pillow
and
his
broad
straw
hat
propped
up
to
screen
him
from
the
wind
with
infinite
care
he
would
extract
a
few
black
grains
from
a
dirty
box
mix
them
with
a
little
water
and
cook
them
over
an
alcohol
lamp
until
the
opium
bubbled
and
was
almost
ready
to
drop
then
placing
it
lovingly
in
the
bowl
of
his
pipe
he
would
hold
it
against
the
flame
and
draw
in
long
breaths
of
the
smoke
the
men
could
work
all
day
without
food
but
opium
was
a
prime
necessity
it
was
almost
impossible
to
start
them
in
the
morning
and
it
became
my
regular
duty
to
make
the
rounds
of
the
filthy
holes
in
which
they
slept
seize
them
by
the
collars
and
drag
them
into
the
street
force
made
the
only
appeal
to
their
deadened
senses
and
we
were
heartily
sick
of
them
before
we
reached
bhamo
the
road
to
bhamo
is
a
gradual
descent
from
five
thousand
feet
to
almost
sea
level
because
of
the
fever
the
valleys
are
largely
inhabited
by
chinese
shans
who
differ
in
dress
and
customs
from
the
southern
shans
of
the
river
few
of
the
men
were
tattooed
and
the
women
all
wore
the
enormous
cylindrical
turban
which
we
had
seen
once
before
in
the
salween
valley
illustration
map
i
the
red
line
indicates
the
travels
of
the
expedition
at
noon
of
the
fifth
day
we
crossed
the
border
into
burma
it
is
a
beautiful
spot
where
a
foaming
mountain
torrent
rushes
out
of
the
jungle
in
a
series
of
picturesque
cascades
and
loses
itself
in
a
living
wall
of
green
the
stream
is
spanned
by
a
splendid
iron
bridge
from
which
a
fine
wide
road
of
crushed
stone
leads
all
the
way
to
bhamo
what
a
difference
between
the
country
we
were
leaving
and
the
one
we
were
about
to
enter
it
is
the
deadly
parallel
of
the
old
east
and
the
new
west
on
the
one
side
is
china
with
her
flooded
roads
and
bridges
of
rotting
timber
the
outward
and
visible
signs
of
a
nation
still
living
in
the
middle
ages
fighting
progress
shackled
by
the
iron
doctrines
of
confucius
to
the
long
dead
past
across
the
river
is
english
burma
with
eyes
turned
forward
ever
watchful
of
the
welfare
of
her
people
her
iron
bridges
and
macadam
roads
representing
the
very
essence
of
modern
thought
and
progress
with
paternal
care
of
her
officials
the
british
government
has
provided
mail
bungalows
at
the
end
of
each
day
journey
which
are
open
to
every
foreign
traveler
they
are
comfortable
little
houses
set
on
piles
each
one
has
a
spacious
living
room
with
a
large
teakwood
table
and
inviting
lounge
chairs
in
a
corner
stands
a
cabinet
of
cutlery
china
and
glass
all
clean
and
in
perfect
order
the
two
bedrooms
are
provided
with
adjoining
baths
and
a
covered
passageway
connects
the
kitchen
with
the
house
all
is
ready
for
the
tired
traveler
and
a
boy
can
be
hired
for
a
trifling
sum

make
the
punkah
punk
such
comforts
can
only
be
appreciated
when
one
has
journeyed
for
months
in
a
country
where
they
do
not
exist
our
last
night
on
the
road
was
spent
at
a
bungalow
near
a
village
only
a
few
miles
from
bhamo
we
were
seated
at
the
window
when
with
a
rattle
of
wheels
the
first
cart
we
had
seen
in
nine
months
passed
by
that
cart
brought
to
us
more
forcibly
than
any
other
thing
a
realization
that
the
expedition
was
ended
and
that
we
were
standing
on
the
threshold
of
civilization
as
yvette
turned
from
the
window
her
eyes
were
wet
with
unshed
tears
and
a
lump
had
risen
in
my
throat
not
all
the
pleasures
of
the
city
the
love
of
friends
or
relatives
could
make
us
wish
to
end
the
wild
free
life
of
the
year
gone
by
silently
we
left
the
house
and
walked
across
the
sunlit
road
into
a
grove
of
graceful
drooping
palms
a
white
pagoda
gleamed
between
the
trees
and
the
pungent
odor
of
wood
smoke
filled
the
air
the
spot
was
redolent
with
the
atmosphere
of
the
lazy
east
the
east
which
like
the
fabled
lorelei
weaves
a
mystic
spell
about
the
wanderer
whom
she
has
loved
and
taken
to
her
heart
while
yet
he
feels
it
not
and
when
he
would
cast
her
off
and
return
to
his
own
again
she
knows
full
well
that
her
subtle
charm
will
bring
him
back
once
more
the
next
morning
we
entered
bhamo
it
is
a
city
of
low
cool
houses
wide
lawns
and
streets
built
on
the
bank
of
the
muddy
irawadi
river
only
a
few
miles
away
the
railroad
reaches
katha
and
palatial
steamers
run
to
mandalay
and
rangoon
we
called
upon
farmer
the
deputy
commissioner
who
offered
the
hospitality
of
the
circuit
house
and
in
the
evening
took
us
with
him
to
the
club
illustration
map
ii
route
of
the
expedition
in
a
military
band
was
playing
and
men
in
white
women
and
officers
in
uniform
strolled
about
or
sipped
iced
drinks
beside
the
tennis
court
we
felt
strange
and
shy
but
doubtless
we
seemed
more
strange
to
them
for
we
were
newly
come
from
a
far
country
which
they
saw
only
as
a
mystic
unknown
land
on
june
at
noon
we
embarked
for
the
journey
to
rangoon
exactly
nine
months
after
we
had
ridden
away
from
fu
toward
the
mountain
of
eternal
snow
our
further
travels
need
not
be
related
here
when
we
reached
civilization
we
expected
that
our
transport
difficulties
were
ended
instead
they
had
only
begun
india
was
isolated
from
the
pacific
and
to
expose
our
valuable
collection
to
the
attacks
of
german
pirates
in
the
mediterranean
and
atlantic
was
not
to
be
considered
even
though
it
necessitated
traveling
two
thirds
around
the
world
to
reach
america
safely
we
left
rangoon
for
calcutta
crossed
india
with
all
our
baggage
to
bombay
and
after
a
seemingly
endless
wait
eventually
succeeded
in
arriving
at
hongkong
by
way
of
singapore
there
we
separated
from
our
faithful
wu
and
sent
him
to
his
home
in
foochow
it
was
hard
to
say
to
wu
for
his
efficient
service
his
enthusiastic
interest
in
the
work
of
the
expedition
and
above
all
his
willingness
to
do
whatever
needed
to
be
done
had
won
our
gratitude
and
affection
we
ourselves
went
northward
to
japan
across
the
pacific
to
vancouver
and
overland
to
new
york
arriving
on
october
nearly
nineteen
months
from
the
time
we
left
we
were
never
separated
from
our
collections
for
had
we
left
them
i
doubt
if
they
would
ever
have
reached
america
it
was
difficult
enough
to
gather
them
in
the
field
but
infinitely
more
so
to
guide
the
cases
through
the
tangled
shipping
net
of
a
world
they
reached
new
york
without
the
loss
of
a
single
specimen
and
are
now
being
prepared
in
the
american
museum
of
natural
history
for
the
study
which
will
place
the
scientific
results
of
the
asiatic
zoölogical
expedition
before
the
public
the
story
of
our
travels
is
at
an
end
once
more
we
are
indefinable
units
in
a
vast
world
bound
by
the
iron
chains
of
convention
to
the
customs
of
civilized
men
and
things
the
glorious
days
in
our
beloved
east
are
gone
and
yet
to
us
the
orient
seems
not
far
away
for
the
miles
of
land
and
water
can
be
traversed
in
a
thought
again
we
stand
before
our
tent
with
the
fragrant
breath
of
the
pines
about
us
watching
the
glistening
peaks
of
the
snow
mountain
turn
purple
and
gold
in
the
setting
sun
again
we
feel
the
mystic
spell
of
the
jungle
or
hear
the
low
sweet
tones
of
a
gibbon
call
we
have
only
to
shut
our
eyes
to
bring
back
a
picture
of
the
bleak
barriers
of
the
forbidden

or
