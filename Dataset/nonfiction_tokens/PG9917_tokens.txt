chancellor
of
chautauqua
institution
with
illustrations
to
her
whose
devotion
and
untiring
effort
toward
an
intelligent
understanding
of
her
children
have
ever
been
an
inspiration
my
mother
and
to
my
children
whose
contribution
toward
my
education
has
been
greater
than
that
from
any
other
source
this
little
book
is
affectionately
dedicated
preface
to
second
edition
in
the
sad
years
that
have
intervened
since
this
book
was
published
we
have
all
been
impressed
by
the
brilliant
achievements
of
science
in
every
department
of
practical
life
but
whereas
the
application
of
chemistry
and
electricity
and
biology
might
perhaps
be
safely
left
to
the
specialists
it
seems
to
me
that
in
a
democracy
it
is
essential
for
every
single
person
to
have
a
practical
understanding
of
the
workings
of
his
own
mind
and
of
his
neighbor
the
understanding
of
human
nature
should
not
be
left
entirely
in
the
hands
of
the
specialists
it
concerns
all
of
us
there
is
no
better
way
for
beginning
the
study
of
human
nature
than
by
following
the
unfolding
of
a
spirit
as
it
takes
place
before
us
in
the
growth
of
a
child
i
am
humbly
grateful
of
the
assurances
received
from
many
quarters
that
these
chapters
have
aided
many
parents
and
teachers
in
such
study
in
the
present
edition
i
have
made
a
number
of
slight
changes
to
harmonize
the
reading
with
the
results
of
later
scientific
studies
there
is
a
new
list
of
references
and
some
new
material
in
the
chapter
on
sex
education
and
there
is
a
new
chapter
suggesting
the
connection
between
the
new
psychology
and
the
democratic
ideals
of
human
relations

preface
in
my
efforts
to
learn
something
about
the
nature
of
the
child
as
a
member
of
groups
and
in
my
own
studies
i
have
found
a
large
mass
of
material
accumulated
by
investigators
into
the
psychology
and
the
biology
of
childhood
which
could
be
of
great
practical
use
to
all
concerned
with
the
bringing
up
of
children
in
this
little
book
i
have
tried
to
present
some
of
this
material
in
a
form
that
will
make
it
available
for
those
who
lack
the
time
or
the
special
training
or
the
opportunity
to
work
it
out
for
themselves
it
has
been
my
chief
aim
to
show
that
a
proper
understanding
of
and
sympathy
with
the
various
stages
through
which
the
child
normally
passes
will
do
much
toward
making
not
only
the
child
happier
but
the
task
of
the
parents
pleasanter
i
am
convinced
that
our
failure
to
understand
the
workings
of
the
child
mind
is
responsible
for
much
of
the
friction
between
parents
and
children
we
can
not
expect
the
children
with
their
limited
experience
and
their
undeveloped
intellect
to
understand
us
if
we
are
to
have
harmony
intimacy
and
cooperation
these
must
come
through
the
parents
successful
efforts
at
understanding
the
children
in
speaking
of
the
child
always
in
the
masculine
i
have
followed
the
custom
of
the
specialists
it
is
of
course
to
be
understood
that
he
sometimes
means
she
and
usually
he
or
she
it
has
been
impossible
to
refer
at
every
point
to
the
source
of
the
material
used
one
unconsciously
absorbs
many
ideas
which
one
is
unable
later
to
trace
to
their
sources
in
addition
to
this
the
material
i
have
here
presented
has
been
worked
over
so
that
it
is
impossible
in
most
cases
to
ascribe
a
particular
idea
to
a
particular
person
i
wish
however
to
acknowledge
my
indebtedness
to
all
who
have
patiently
labored
in
this
field
and
especially
to
those
masters
of
child
study

i
owe
much
to
my
opportunity
to

in

study
these
groups
of
mothers
and

have
done
a
great
deal
under
the
guidance
and
inspiration
of
professor
felix

to
develop
a
spirit
of
in
the
attack
upon

am
very
grateful
to

for
her
assistance
in
revising
the
manuscript
and
in
securing
the
illustrations
the
assistance
of
my
husband
has
been
invaluable
in
his
suggestions
and
criticisms
he
has
given
me
the
benefit
of
his
experience

new
york
may
a
foreword
in
the
thought
of
the
writer
of
this
prefatory
page
the
book
he
thus
introduces
is
an
exceptionally
sane
practical
and
valuable
treatment
of
the
problem
of
problems
suggested
by
our
present
american
civilization
namely
the
training
of
the
generation
the
new
americans
who
are
to
realize
the
dreams
of
our
ancestors
concerning
personal
freedom
and
development
in
the
social
political
commercial
and
religious
life
of
the
republic
there
is
always
hope
for
the
adult
who
takes
any
real
interest
in
one
is
never
too
old
to
turn
over
a
new
leaf
and
to
begin
a
new
record
a
man
may
become
a
promising
child
in
the
kingdom
of
grace
he
may
dream
dreams
and
see
visions
he
may
resolve
and
his
experience
of
forty
or
more
years
in
practising
decision
and
in
persisting
despite
counter
inclinations
may
only
increase
his
chances
for
mastering
a
problem
overcoming
a
difficulty
and
developing
enthusiasm
a
page
of
history
or
of
ethics
a
poet
vision
or
a
philosopher
reasoning
will
find
a
response
in
his
personality
impossible
to
a
juvenile
his
knowledge
of
real
life
of
persons
he
has
met
of
theories
he
has
often
pondered
of
difficulties
he
has
encountered
and
canvassed
the
conversations
and
discussions
in
which
he
has
taken
part
all
give
new
value
to
the
pages
he
is
now
turning
and
while
he
may
not
as
easily
as
formerly
memorize
the
language
he
at
once
grasps
appreciates
and
appropriates
the
thoughts
there
expressed
with
these
advantages
as
a
thinker
a
reader
a
man
of
affairs
a
father
interested
in
his
or
children
and
in
their
education
what
a
blessing
to
him
and
to
his
family
comes
through
the
reading
of
an
interesting
suggestive
and
stimulating
book
on
child
training
such
as
this
practical
volume
by
gruenberg
in
fact
the
book
becomes
a
sort
of
a
normal
class
in
itself
it
is
attractive
ingenious
illustrative
and
stimulating
an
example
of
the
true
teaching
spirit
and
method
this
volume
has
in
it
much
that
a
preacher
and
pastor
would
do
well
to
read
and
a
wise
pastor
will
be
inclined
to
bring
together
mothers
and
teachers
and
read
to
them
certain
paragraphs
until
they
are
induced
to
put
a
copy
of
the
volume
in
their
own
library
and
thus
become
in
a
sense
members
of
a
strong
and
most
helpful
normal
class
one
thing
every
teacher
and
every
parent
should
remember
is
that
all
attempts
to
experiment
in
the
instruction
of
children
are
so
many
steps
towards
normal
work
in
which
are
included
the
use
of
illustrations
the
framing
of
questions
the
devices
to
get
attention
and
the
effort
to
induce
children
to
think
for
themselves
and
freely
to
express
their
thoughts
reasonings
doubts
difficulties
and
personal
independent
opinions
all
these
efforts
not
only
develop
power
in
the
child
but
they
react
upon
the
teacher
and
ensure
for
the
next
meeting
of
the
class
some
new
suggestion
some
additional
question
some
fresh
view
of
the
whole
subject
by
which
both
teacher
and
pupils
will
be
stimulated
and
instructed
in
our
intercourse
with
children
let
us
aim
to
develop
the
motive
and
we
shall
not
only
make
the
work
of
the
class
room
profitable
to
the
pupils
but
each
of
us
will
find
new
delight
new
inspiration
and
an
unanticipated
degree
of
success
in
this
beautiful
and
divine
ministry

housekeeping
in
the
sense
of
administering
the
work
of
the
household
has
been
raised
almost
to
a
science
the
same
is
true
of
the
feeding
of
children
but
the
training
of
children
still
lags
behind
so
far
as
most
of
us
are
concerned
in
the
stage
occupied
by
housekeeping
and
farming
a
generation
or
two
ago
there
has
indeed
been
developed
a
considerable
mass
of
exact
knowledge
about
the
nature
of
the
child
and
about
the
laws
of
his
development
but
this
knowledge
has
been
for
most
parents
a
closed
book
it
is
not
what
the
scientists
know
but
what
the
people
apply
that
marks
our
progress
has
been
considered
something
with
which
young
students
have
to
struggle
before
they
begin
their
struggle
with
bad
boys
but
mothers
have
been
expected
to
know
through
some
divine
instinct
just
how
to
handle
their
own
children
without
any
special
study
or
preparation
that
the
divine
instinct
has
not
taught
them
properly
to
feed
the
young
infant
and
the
growing
child
we
have
learned
but
slowly
and
at
great
cost
in
human
life
and
suffering
but
we
learned
it
our
next
lesson
should
be
to
realize
that
our
instincts
can
not
be
relied
upon
when
it
comes
to
understanding
the
child
mind
the
meaning
of
his
various
activities
and
how
best
to
guide
his
mental
and
moral
development
mistakes
that
parents
and
teachers
make
in
dealing
with
the
child
mind
are
not
often
fatal
nor
can
you
always
trace
the
evil
effects
of
such
mistakes
in
the
later
character
of
the
child
but
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
many
of
the
heartbreaks
misunderstandings
and
estrangements
between
parents
and
children
are
due
to
mistakes
that
could
have
been
avoided
by
a
knowledge
of
the
nature
of
the
child
mind
there
are
fortunately
many
parents
who
arrive
at
an
understanding
of
the
nature
of
the
child
through
sympathetic
insight
through
quick
observation
through
the
application
of
sound
sense
and
the
results
of
experience
to
the
problems
that
arise
it
is
not
necessary
that
all
of
us
approach
the
child
in
the
attitude
of
the
professional
scientist
indeed
it
is
neither
possible
for
us
to
do
so
nor
is
it
desirable
that
we
should
but
it
is
both
possible
and
desirable
that
we
make
use
of
the
experience
and
observations
of
others
that
we
apply
the
results
of
scientific
experiments
that
we
reënforce
our
instincts
with
all
available
helps
we
need
not
fall
into
the
error
of
placing
and
practical
insight
in
opposition
to
the
method
of
the
scientists
everyone
in
this
country
appreciates
the
wonderful
and
valuable
services
of
luther
burbank
and
no
one
doubts
that
if
his
method
could
be
extended
the
whole
nation
would
benefit
in
an
economic
way
yet
burbank
has
been
unable
to
teach
the
rest
of
us
how
to
apply
his
shrewd
and
his
keen
intuition
to
the
improvement
of
useful
and
ornamental
plants
it
was
necessary
for
scientists
to
study
what
he
had
done
in
order
to
make
available
for
the
whole
world
those
principles
that
make
his
practice
really
productive
of
desirable
results
in
the
same
way
it
is
well
for
every
parent
and
every
teacher
everyone
who
has
to
do
with
children
to
supplement
good
sense
and
observation
with
the
results
of
scientific
study
on
the
other
hand
there
is
no
universal
formula
for
the
bringing
up
of
children
one
that
can
be
applied
to
all
children
everywhere
and
always
any
more
than
there
is
a
universal
formula
for
fertilizing
soil
or
curing
disease
or
feeding
babies
yet
there
are
certain
general
laws
of
child
development
and
certain
general
principles
of
child
training
which
have
been
derived
from
scientific
studies
of
children
and
which
agree
with
the
best
thought
and
experience
of
those
who
learned
to
know
their
children
without
the
help
of
science
these
general
laws
and
principles
may
be
profitably
learned
and
used
in
bringing
up
the
rising
generation
too
many
people
and
especially
too
many
parents
think
of
the
child
as
merely
a
small
man
or
woman
this
is
far
from
a
true
conception
of
the
child
just
as
the
physical
organs
of
the
child
work
in
a
manner
different
from
what
we
find
in
the
adult
so
the
mind
of
the
child
works
along
in
a
way
peculiar
to
its
stage
of
development
if
a
physician
should
use
the
same
formulas
for
treating
ailments
as
he
uses
with
adults
simply
reducing
the
size
of
the
dose
we
should
consider
his
methods
rather
crude
if
a
parent
should
feed
an
infant
the
same
materials
that
she
supplied
to
the
rest
of
the
family
only
in
smaller
quantities
we
should
consider
her
too
ignorant
to
be
entrusted
with
the
care
of
the
child
and
for
similar
reasons
we
must
learn
that
the
behavior
of
the
child
must
be
judged
according
to
standards
different
from
those
we
apply
to
an
adult
the
same
act
represents
different
motives
in
a
child
and
in
an
adult
or
in
the
same
child
at
different
ages
moreover
each
child
is
different
from
every
other
child
in
the
whole
world
the
law
has
recognized
that
a
given
act
committed
by
two
different
persons
may
really
be
two
entirely
different
acts
from
a
moral
point
of
view
how
much
more
important
is
it
for
the
parent
or
the
teacher
to
recognize
that
each
child
must
be
treated
in
accordance
with
his
own
nature
it
is
the
duty
of
every
mother
to
know
the
nature
of
child
in
order
that
she
may
assist
in
the
development
of
all
of
his
possibilities
child
study
is
a
new
science
but
old
enough
to
give
us
great
help
through
what
the
experts
have
found
out
about
child
nature
but
the
experts
do
not
know
child
they
have
studied
the
problems
of
childhood
and
their
results
you
can
use
in
learning
to
know
your
child
your
problem
is
always
an
individual
problem
the
problem
of
the
scientist
is
a
general
one
from
the
general
results
however
you
may
get
suggestions
for
the
solution
of
your
individual
problem
we
all
know
the
mother
who
complains
that
her
boys
did
not
turn
out
just
the
way
she
wanted
them
to
although
they
are
very
good
boys
after
they
have
grown
up
she
suddenly
realizes
one
day
how
far
they
are
from
her
in
spirit
she
could
have
avoided
the
disillusion
by
recognizing
early
enough
that
the
interests
and
instincts
of
her
boys
were
healthy
ones
notwithstanding
they
were
so
different
from
her
own
she
would
have
been
more
to
the
boys
and
they
more
to
her
if
instead
of
wasting
her
energy
in
trying
to
make
them
like
herself
she
had
tried
to
develop
their
tastes
and
inclinations
to
their
full
possibilities
how
much
happier
is
the
home
in
which
the
mother
understands
the
children
and
knows
how
to
treat
each
according
to
his
disposition
instead
of
treating
all
by
some
arbitrary
rule
as
a
mother
of
three
children
said
one
day
with
mary
just
a
hint
of
what
i
wish
is
sufficient
to
secure
results

to
give
a

get
the
best
results
by
explaining
and
appealing
to
his
reason
how
much
trouble
she
saves
herself
and
the
children
by
having
found
this
much
out
a
mother
who
knows
that
what
we
commonly
call
the
spirit
of
destruction
in
a
child
is
the
same
as
the
will
not
be
so
much
grieved
when
her
baby
takes
the
alarm
clock
apart
as
the
mother
who
looks
upon
this
deed
as
an
indication
of
depravity
or
wickedness
illustration
the
impulse
to
action
early
leads
to
doing
some
of
the
directions
in
which
the
parents
may
profit
from
what
the
specialists
have
worked
out
may
be
suggested
there
is
the
question
of
punishment
for
example
how
many
of
us
have
thought
out
a
satisfactory
philosophy
of
punishment
in
our
personal
relations
with
our
children
we
all
too
frequently
cling
to
the
theory
of
punishment
that
justifies
us
in
paying
back
for
the
trouble
we
have
been
caused
if
indeed
we
do
any
more
than
vent
our
temper
at
the
annoyance
it
is
not
viciousness
on
our
part
it
is
merely
ignorance
but
the
time
is
rapidly
approaching
when
there
will
be
no
excuse
for
ignorance
even
if
it
is
not
yet
time
to
say
that
preventable
ignorance
is
vicious
how
many
mothers
for
example
realize
that
the
desire
on
the
part
of
the
child
to
touch
to
do
to
get
into
mischief
is
a
fundamental
characteristic
of
childhood
and
not
an
indication
of
perversity
in
her
particular
johnny
or
mary
how
many
know
that
these
instincts
are
the
most
useful
and
the
most
usable
traits
that
the
child
has
that
the
checking
of
these
impulses
may
mean
the
destruction
of
individual
qualities
of
great
importance
in
the
formation
of
character
how
many
know
how
wisely
to
direct
these
instincts
without
thwarting
them
how
many
mothers
good
housewives
know
anything
at
all
about
the
imagination
that
crowning
glory
of
the
human
mind
they
admire
the
poet
flights
of
fancy
but
when
on
being
asked
where
his
brother
is
harry
says
he
went
off
in
a
great
great
big
airship
they
feel
the
call
of
duty
to
punish
him
for
his
many
of
us
have
realized
in
a
helpless
sort
of
way
that
there
is
need
for
expert
knowledge
in
these
matters
and
have
comfortably
shifted
the
responsibility
to
the
teacher
parents
are
often
heard
to
say
when
a
troublesome
youngster
is
under
discussion
just
wait
until
he
begins
to
go
to
school
it
is
not
wise
to
wait
there
is
much
to
be
done
before
the
school
can
be
thought
of
or
even
before
the
kindergarten
age
is
reached
indeed
a
child
is
never
too
young
to
profit
from
the
application
of
thought
and
knowledge
to
his
treatment
of
course
the
training
value
of
the
school
work
is
not
to
be
underestimated
the
social
intercourse
that
the
child
experiences
there
the
regularity
of
hours
the
teacher
personality
all
have
their
favorable
influence
in
the
molding
of
the
child
character
but
neither
must
we
overestimate
the
powers
of
the
school
the
school
has
the
child
but
a
few
hours
a
day
for
barely
more
than
half
the
year
the
classes
are
unconscionably
large
we
all
hope
that
the
classes
will
be
made
smaller
but
they
never
can
be
small
enough
within
our
own
times
for
the
purpose
of
really
effective
moral
training
the
relations
between
teacher
and
pupil
can
never
be
as
intimate
as
are
those
of
parent
and
child
the
teacher
knows
the
child
as
a
rule
only
as
a
member
of
a
group
and
under
special
circumstances
the
parents
alone
have
the
opportunity
to
know
closely
the
individual
peculiarities
of
the
child
they
alone
can
know
him
in
health
and
in
sickness
in
joy
and
in
sorrow
in
his
strength
and
in
his
weakness
the
parents
can
watch
their
child
from
day
to
day
year
after
year
whereas
the
teacher
sees
the
child
for
a
comparatively
short
period
of
his
development
and
then
passes
him
on
to
another
the
time
was
and
for
most
of
our
children
still
is
when
the
teacher
had
to
know
nothing
but
her
subjects
the
nature
of
the
child
was
to
her
as
great
a
mystery
as
it
is
to
the
ordinary
person
who
never
learned
anything
about
it
she
was
supposed
to
deal
with
the
average
child
that
does
not
exist
and
to
attempt
the
futile
task
of
drawing
the
laggard
up
to
this
arbitrary
average
and
of
holding
the
genius
down
to
it
the
effort
is
being
made
to
have
the
teacher
recognize
the
individuality
of
each
child
but
the
mother
is
still
expected
to
confine
her
ministrations
to
his
individual
digestion
in
a
dozen
different
ways
the
effective
methods
in
the
treatment
of
children
at
home
or
in
school
in
the
church
or
on
the
playground
depend
upon
knowledge
and
understanding
as
is
the
case
in
all
practical
activities
instincts
alone
are
never
sufficient
to
tell
us
what
to
do
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
so
much
really
valuable
work
has
been
achieved
in
the
past
without
any
special
training
it
may
be
true
that
in
the
past
the
instincts
of
the
child
adapted
him
to
the
needs
of
life
it
may
also
be
true
that
the
instincts
of
adults
adapted
them
in
the
past
to
their
proper
treatment
of
children
we
should
realize
however
that
the
conditions
of
modern
life
are
so
complex
that
few
of
us
know
just
what
to
do
under
given
conditions
unless
we
have
made
a
special
effort
to
find
out
and
this
is
just
as
true
of
the
treatment
of
children
as
it
is
of
the
care
of
the
health
or
of
the
building
of
bridges
it
is
for
this
reason
that
the
results
of
child
study
are
important
to
all
who
have
to
do
with
children
whether
as
teachers
or
as
parents
whether
as
club
leaders
or
as
directors
of
institutions
whether
as
social
workers
or
as
loving
uncles
and
aunts
it
is
impossible
to
guarantee
to
anyone
that
a
study
of
child
nature
will
enable
him
or
her
to
train
children
into
models
of
good
behavior
knowledge
alone
does
not
always
produce
the
desired
results
nevertheless
an
understanding
of
the
child
should
enable
those
who
have
to
deal
with
him
to
assume
an
attitude
that
will
reduce
in
a
great
measure
their
annoyance
at
the
various
awkward
and
inconsiderate
and
mischievous
acts
of
the
youngsters
such
a
study
should
make
possible
a
closer
intimacy
with
the
child
and
finally
it
should
make
possible
a
longer
continuance
of
that
intimacy
with
the
child
which
is
so
helpful
for
those
in
authority
as
well
as
for
the
child
himself
ii
the
problem
of
punishment
picture
to
yourself
a
dark
hallway
behind
the
door
stands
an
indignant
mother
with
a
strap
in
her
hand
it
is
past
the
dinner
hour
and
william
has
not
yet
returned
but
here
he
is
now
he
comes
bounding
up
the
steps
radiantly
happy
and
under
each
arm
a
pumpkin
he
bursts
into
the
house
his
mother
seizes
him
by
the
shoulder
and
proceeds
to
apply
the
strap
where
she
thinks
it
will
do
the
most
good
the
little
boy
is
william
stillman
and
the
story
is
told
in
his
autobiography
he
tells
how
just
an
hour
before
dinner
a
neighboring
farmer
had
asked
him
to
go
to
his
field
to
shake
down
the
fruit
from
two
apple
trees
william
was
so
glad
to
do
something
for
which
he
would
receive
pay
that
he
allowed
the
work
to
trench
upon
his
the
two
large
pumpkins
he
brought
were
his
pay
and
he
knew
that
they
meant
a
great
deal
to
his
needy
family
stillman
in
writing
of
the
incident
continues
it
is
more
than
sixty
years
since
that
punishment
fell
on
my
shoulders
but
the
astonishment
with
which
i
received
the
flogging
instead
of
the
thanks
which
i
anticipated
for
the
wages
i
was
bringing
her
the
haste
with
which
any
mother
administered
it
lest
my
father
should
anticipate
her
and
beat
me
after
his
own
fashion
are
as
vivid
in
my
recollection
as
if
it
had
taken
place
yesterday
while
i
hope
that
not
many
of
us
are
guilty
of
such
flagrant
abuse
of
our
power
as
is
described
above
still
i
am
certain
that
on
many
occasions
we
punish
just
as
hastily
without
giving
a
chance
for
explanation
and
with
as
little
thought
as
to
whether
the
punishment
fits
the
crime
i
have
often
been
impressed
by
the
great
interest
that
mothers
take
in
uses
of
punishment
and
in
kinds
of
punishment
it
has
sometimes
seemed
as
if
the
most
valuable
thing
which
they
could
carry
away
with
them
from
some
meeting
was
a
new
kind
of
punishment
for
some
very
common
offence
i
have
frequently
felt
as
if
the
only
contact
some
mothers
have
with
their
children
is
to
punish
them
and
that
punishment
constituted
the
chief
part
of
the
poor
training
now
punishment
undoubtedly
has
a
place
in
the
training
of
children
but
only
a
place
the
proper
punishment
administered
in
the
right
spirit
may
cure
or
correct
a
fault
punishment
does
not
make
children
if
children
are
punished
frequently
it
may
even
make
them
we
can
all
remember
some
of
the
punishments
of
our
own
childhood
how
unjust
they
seemed
then
and
do
even
now
after
all
these
years
to
heal
the
wounds
how
outraged
we
felt
into
how
unloving
a
mood
they
put
us
the
history
of
punishment
for
criminals
shows
us
three
stages
with
primitive
peoples
and
in
early
times
the
first
impulse
is
to
get
even
or
to
strike
back
an
eye
for
an
eye
nothing
less
would
do
then
comes
a
stage
in
which
punishment
is
used
to
frighten
people
from
and
as
a
warning
a
deterrent
for
others
gradually
very
very
slowly
as
we
become
more
civilized
and
develop
moral
insight
develop
a
love
for
humanity
we
come
to
recognize
that
the
only
legitimate
purpose
of
punishment
in
the
treatment
of
offenders
is
to
redeem
their
characters
to
make
them
better
not
merely
frighten
them
into
a
state
of
apparent
that
is
a
state
of
avoiding
it
is
said
that
each
individual
in
his
development
lives
over
the
experiences
of
the
race
how
each
of
us
passes
through
the
three
attitudes
toward
punishment
is
very
interestingly
shown
by
a
study
that
was
made
some
years
ago
on
school
children
to
find
out
their
own
ideas
about
punishment
miss
margaret
schallenberger
sent
out
the
following
story
and
query
and
had
the
answers
tabulated
jennie
had
a
beautiful
new
box
of
paints
and
in
the
afternoon
while
her
mother
was
gone
she
painted
all
the
chairs
in
the
parlor
so
as
to
make
them
look
nice
for
her
mother
when
the
mother
came
home
jennie
ran
to
meet
her
and
said
oh
mamma
come
and
see
how
pretty
i
have
made
the
parlor
but
her
mamma
took
her
paints
away
and
sent
her
to
bed
if
you
had
been
her
mother
what
would
you
have
done
or
said
to
jennie
in
the
answers
the
most
striking
thing
is
the
range
of
reasons
given
by
the
children
for
punishing
jennie
there
are
three
prominent
reasons
the
first
is
clearly
for
revenge
jennie
was
a
bad
girl
she
made
her
mother
unhappy
she
must
be
made
unhappy
she
made
her
mother
angry
she
must
be
made
angry
a
boy
of
ten
says
i
would
have
sent
jennie
to
bed
and
not
given
her
any
supper
and
then
she
would
get
mad
and
cry
one
boy
of
nine
says
if
i
had
been
that
woman
i
would
have
half
killed
her
a
sweet
little
girl
would
make
her
paint
things
until
she
is
got
enough
of
it
another
girl
if
i
had
been
jennie
mother
i
would
of
painted
jennie
face
and
hands
and
toes
i
would
of
switched
her
well
i
would
of
washed
her
mouth
out
with
soap
and
water
and
i
should
stand
her
on
the
floor
for
half
an
hour
this
view
was
taken
mostly
by
the
younger
children
the
second
reason
for
punishing
is
to
prevent
a
repetition
of
the
act
a
thirteen
year
old
girl
says
i
would
take
the
paints
away
and
not
let
her
have
them
until
she
learned
not
to
do
that
again
when
a
threat
is
used
it
is
with
the
same
idea
in
view
i
do
anything
just
then
but
i
would
have
said
you
do
that
any
more
i
would
whip
you
and
send
you
to
bed
besides
all
trace
of
revenge
has
disappeared
the
third
stage
of
punishment
is
higher
still
jennie
is
punished
in
order
to
reform
her
in
the
previous
examples
the
was
now
jennie
and
her
moral
condition
come
into
the
foreground
none
of
the
younger
children
take
the
trouble
to
explain
to
jennie
why
it
was
wrong
to
paint
the
parlor
chairs
a
large
percentage
of
the
older
ones
do
so
explain
a
country
boy
of
fourteen
says
i
would
have
took
her
with
me
into
the
parlor
and
i
would
have
talked
to
her
about
the
injury
she
had
done
to
the
chairs
and
talked
kindly
to
her
and
explained
to
her
that
the
paints
were
not
what
was
put
on
chairs
to
make
them
look
nice
a
girl
of
sixteen
says
i
think
that
the
mother
was
very
unwise
to
lose
her
temper
over
something
which
the
child
had
done
to
please
her
i
think
it
would
have
been
far
wiser
in
her
to
have
kissed
the
little
one
and
then
explained
to
her
how
much
mischief
she
had
done
in
trying
to
please
her
mother
we
can
see
from
this
study
that
the
children
themselves
are
capable
of
reaching
a
rather
lofty
attitude
toward
and
punishment
yet
these
children
when
grown
up
that
is
we
ourselves
so
frequently
return
to
a
more
primitive
way
of
looking
at
these
problems
in
punishing
our
children
we
go
back
to
the
method
of
the
and
what
is
the
reason
for
our
apparent
is
it
not
plainly
the
fact
that
we
allow
ourselves
to
be
mastered
by
the
animal
instinct
to
strike
back
when
the
child
does
something
that
causes
annoyance
or
even
damage
do
we
stop
to
consider
his
motive
his
intent
or
do
we
only
respond
to
the
of
his
action
do
we
have
a
studied
policy
for
treating
his
offence
or
do
we
slide
back
to
the
desire
to
get
even
or
to
pay
him
for
what
he
has
done
sometimes
a
very
small
offence
will
have
grave
consequences
while
a
really
serious
fault
may
cause
but
little
trouble
here
for
instance
is
harry
who
was
so
intent
upon
chasing
the
woodchuck
that
he
ran
through
the
field
trampling
down
the
earth
he
caused
considerable
damage
if
your
punishment
assumes
the
proportion
dictated
by
the
anger
which
the
harm
caused
he
certainly
will
be
dealt
with
severely
knowing
that
he
had
not
meant
to
do
wrong
he
can
not
help
but
feel
the
injustice
of
your
wrath
of
course
he
has
been
careless
and
he
must
be
impressed
with
the
harm
such
carelessness
can
cause
whether
you
lock
him
in
a
room
or
deprive
him
of
some
special
pleasure
or
whether
you
merely
talk
to
him
depends
upon
you
and
upon
harry
but
one
thing
must
be
certain
harry
must
not
get
the
notion
that
you
are
avenging
yourself
upon
him
for
the
harm
he
has
done
or
for
the
aroused
by
his
act
he
must
not
feel
that
you
are
taking
it
out
of
him
because
you
have
been
made
angry
this
brings
us
to
the
old
rule
punish
in
on
the
other
hand
while
we
must
allow
every
trace
of
anger
to
disappear
we
must
not
allow
so
much
time
to
elapse
as
to
make
the
child
lose
the
connection
between
his
act
and
the
consequence
a
little
boy
at
breakfast
threw
some
salt
upon
his
sister
apple
in
a
spirit
of
mischief
the
mother
sent
him
out
of
the
room
and
told
him
that
he
would
have
to
go
to
bed
two
hours
earlier
than
usual
that
night
as
a
punishment
for
his
misdeed
now
we
all
know
that
the
days
of
youth
are
long
long
days
and
the
many
events
of
that
day
had
completely
crowded
out
of
the
little
boy
mind
the
trivial
impulsive
act
of
the
morning
the
punishment
could
not
arouse
in
him
any
feeling
but
that
of
unjust
privation
this
particular
case
illustrates
three
other
problems
in
connection
with
punishment
in
the
first
place
nothing
that
is
considered
desirable
or
beneficial
should
be
brought
into
disfavor
by
being
used
as
a
punishment
sleep
is
a
blessing
and
it
may
be
said
in
general
no
healthy
child
gets
too
much
of
it
by
imposing
two
hours
of
additional
sleep
upon
the
child
the
mother
discredits
sleeping
it
is
logical
it
is
as
unreasonable
as
that
once
favorite
punishment
of
teachers
now
rapidly
being
discarded
of
keeping
children
after
school
on
the
one
side
they
are
told
how
grateful
they
should
be
for
this
great
boon
of
education
and
for
being
allowed
to
come
to
school
and
then
they
are
told
you
have
been
very
bad
and
troublesome
as
a
punishment
you
shall
have
an
extra
hour
of
this
great
privilege
the
second
point
is
that
no
punishment
should
ever
deprive
a
child
of
conditions
that
are
necessary
for
his
health
or
impose
conditions
that
are
harmful
and
finally
it
is
not
wise
to
exaggerate
the
importance
of
trivial
acts
by
treating
them
too
seriously
the
little
boy
tried
to
be
smart
when
he
threw
that
salt
with
nearly
every
child
it
would
be
sufficient
in
a
case
like
this
to
make
him
feel
that
it
was
really
very
silly
and
that
he
had
made
himself
ridiculous
in
the
eyes
of
the
family
very
often
the
seriousness
of
a
child
offence
is
greatly
exaggerated
we
must
not
waste
our
ammunition
on
these
small
matters
if
we
use
our
strongest
terms
of
disapproval
for
the
many
little
everyday
vexations
we
shall
be
left
quite
without
resource
when
something
really
serious
does
occur
children
are
very
sensitive
to
such
exaggerations
and
their
attention
is
so
much
taken
up
with
the
injustice
of
making
a
big
ado
about
such
trifles
that
they
overlook
what
is
reprehensible
in
their
own
conduct
some
of
the
greatest
authorities
believe
that
a
child
should
be
allowed
to
suffer
the
consequences
of
his
deeds
we
should
borrow
from
nature
they
say
her
method
of
dealing
with
offenders
if
a
child
touches
fire
he
will
be
burnt
and
each
time
the
same
effect
will
follow
his
deed
why
not
let
our
punishments
be
as
certain
and
uniform
in
their
reaction
to
a
certain
extent
this
plan
can
be
followed
if
a
little
girl
stubbornly
refuses
to
wear
her
mittens
it
is
all
right
to
let
her
suffer
the
consequences
the
natural
consequences
and
let
her
hands
get
quite
cold
but
this
principle
can
not
be
consistently
applied
as
a
general
method
if
a
child
insists
upon
leaning
far
out
of
the
window
it
would
be
foolish
to
let
him
suffer
the
consequences
and
fall
possibly
to
his
death
part
of
our
function
is
to
prevent
our
children
from
suffering
all
the
possible
consequences
of
their
actions
we
are
here
to
guide
them
and
to
protect
them
to
abandon
the
child
to
the
natural
consequences
of
his
moral
actions
would
be
even
more
harmful
for
very
often
we
must
separate
the
child
from
his
fault
this
is
true
in
a
double
sense
in
the
first
place
we
are
concerned
chiefly
in
removing
the
faults
as
a
physician
seeks
to
separate
a
patient
from
his
sickness
but
we
must
also
avoid
the
error
of
identifying
any
fault
with
the
fundamental
nature
of
the
child
that
is
we
must
keep
before
us
the
character
of
the
child
as
distinct
from
the
wrong
acts
which
the
child
may
commit
if
a
child
lies
that
does
not
make
of
him
a
liar
any
more
than
does
his
failure
to
understand
what
he
has
just
been
told
make
of
him
a
blockhead
yet
the
natural
consequence
of
lying
for
instance
is
to
be
mistrusted
in
the
future
to
be
branded
a
liar
this
however
is
one
of
the
worst
things
that
can
happen
to
a
child
and
one
of
the
surest
ways
of
making
him
a
habitual
liar
many
children
pass
through
a
stage
in
which
they
naturally
come
to
have
the
feeling
which
is
expressed
in
the
saying
if
i
have
the
name
i
may
as
well
have
the
game
we
must
show
the
child
that
we
have
unbounded
confidence
in
him
otherwise
he
will
lose
faith
in
himself
it
is
clear
then
that
the
natural
method
will
not
work
in
such
cases
for
the
impulse
to
condemn
the
child
after
he
has
committed
a
wrong
deed
instead
of
condemning
the
may
merely
help
to
fix
upon
him
the
habit
of
committing
similar
deeds
in
the
future
in
nature
too
the
same
punishment
invariably
follows
the
same
offence
if
we
try
to
imitate
that
method
the
child
soon
learns
what
he
has
to
reckon
with
if
the
child
knows
that
a
certain
action
will
produce
a
certain
result
he
often
thinks
it
is
worth
the
price
then
the
child
feels
that
he
has
had
his
way
and
having
paid
the
price
the
account
is
squared
so
he
feels
justified
in
doing
the
same
thing
again
in
following
this
course
we
defeat
our
own
ends
as
this
kind
of
punishment
does
act
as
a
fine
moral
deterrent
scolding
as
a
punishment
is
also
not
efficacious
we
are
justified
in
having
our
indignation
aroused
at
times
and
in
letting
the
offender
feel
our
displeasure
there
is
something
calm
and
impressive
about
genuine
indignation
while
scolding
is
apt
to
become
nagging
and
to
arouse
contempt
in
the
child
when
we
consider
the
many
difficulties
of
finding
a
punishment
exactly
fitted
to
the
offence
in
a
way
that
will
make
the
offender
avoid
repetition
we
are
tempted
to
resort
to
sermonizing
and
reasoning
for
through
our
words
we
hope
at
times
to
establish
in
the
child
mind
a
direct
relation
between
his
conduct
and
the
undesirable
consequences
that
spring
from
it
in
doing
this
however
we
should
not
speak
in
generalities
but
bring
before
the
child
mind
concrete
examples
of
his
own
objectionable
acts
from
recent
experience
it
is
useless
to
tell
john
how
important
it
is
to
be
punctual
and
let
it
go
at
that
it
is
not
enough
even
to
tell
him
that
he
often
fails
to
be
on
time
if
you
can
remind
him
that
he
was
late
for
dinner
on
wednesday
missed
the
twice
last
month
and
delayed
attending
to
an
errand
monday
until
all
the
shops
were
closed
you
have
him
where
he
can
understand
your
point
mary
will
listen
respectfully
enough
to
a
homily
on
being
considerate
but
it
will
have
little
effect
upon
her
compared
to
bringing
before
her
a
picture
of
some
of
her
actions
how
instead
of
coming
right
home
from
school
the
day
you
were
not
feeling
well
and
helping
you
with
some
of
your
tasks
she
had
gone
to
visit
a
friend
just
that
afternoon
but
reasoning
with
a
child
often
fails
to
accomplish
its
purpose
because
the
child
reasoning
is
so
different
from
that
of
an
adult
unless
there
is
a
nearly
perfect
understanding
of
the
workings
of
the
child
mind
reasoning
is
frequently
futile
a
boy
who
had
received
a
long
lecture
on
the
impropriety
of
keeping
dead
crabs
in
his
pockets
said
after
it
was
all
over
well
they
were
alive
when
i
put
them
in
you
are
wasting
a
lot
of
my
precious
time
these
little
brains
have
a
way
of
working
out
combinations
that
seem
weird
to
us
only
with
a
child
of
a
certain
type
and
a
parent
able
to
understand
the
workings
of
his
mind
may
the
method
of
reasoning
work
satisfactorily
in
correcting
faults
and
establishing
good
habits
and
ideals
no
discussion
of
this
subject
would
be
complete
without
a
word
on
corporal
punishment
it
is
impossible
here
to
present
all
the
arguments
for
or
against
it
i
am
sure
however
that
the
most
enthusiastic
advocates
of
it
will
admit
that
it
is
not
always
practised
with
discretion
and
that
it
is
in
most
cases
not
only
unnecessary
but
positively
harmful
children
that
are
treated
like
animals
will
behave
like
animals
violence
and
brutality
do
not
bring
out
the
best
in
a
child
nature
it
would
seem
that
intelligent
parents
do
not
need
to
resort
to
such
methods
in
the
training
of
normal
children
as
suggested
by
our
veteran
novelist
william
dean
howells
we
have
clung
to
the
wisdom
of
solomon
in
this
respect
through
centuries
of
changing
conditions
solomon
said
spare
the
rod
and
spoil
the
child
howells
suggests
that
we
might
with
profit
spoil
the
rod
and
spare
the
child
in
the
small
families
of
there
is
no
need
to
cling
to
the
methods
that
may
have
worked
well
enough
with
the
oriental
polygamous
despot
who
never
could
know
all
his
children
individually
and
it
is
therefore
hardly
necessary
to
use
solomon
as
our
authority
it
is
plain
then
that
it
is
impossible
to
recommend
any
punishment
as
correct
or
even
to
recommend
any
one
infallible
rule
this
must
depend
upon
the
parent
upon
the
child
and
upon
the
circumstances
but
there
are
certain
definite
principles
which
we
must
keep
in
mind
and
which
will
do
much
toward
making
our
task
of
discipline
more
rational
we
must
never
punish
in
anger
we
must
consider
the
and
the
before
the
of
the
deed
we
must
condemn
the
and
not
the
child
we
must
be
sure
that
the
child
understands
exactly
the
offence
with
which
he
is
charged
we
must
be
sure
that
he
sees
the
of
the
to
the
we
must
never
administer
any
or
unusual
punishment
we
must
not
the
magnitude
of
the
offence
if
we
keep
these
principles
in
mind
we
may
not
always
be
right
but
we
shall
certainly
be
right
more
often
than
if
we
had
no
policy
or
definite
ideas
but
above
all
we
must
recognize
that
punishment
is
only
a
corrective
and
that
it
is
our
duty
to
build
up
the
positive
virtues
let
us
expend
our
energy
in
the
effort
to
establish
good
habits
and
ideals
and
the
child
will
shed
many
of
the
faults
which
now
occupy
the
centre
of
our
interest
and
attention
in
a
family
where
the
proper
spirit
of
intimacy
and
mutual
understanding
and
forbearance
reigns
punishment
will
be
relegated
to
its
proper
place
namely
the
medicine
closet
and
not
be
used
as
daily
bread
for
punishment
is
a
medicine
a
corrective
and
when
we
administer
it
we
must
do
in
the
spirit
of
the
physician
we
do
not
wish
to
be
quacks
and
have
one
patent
remedy
to
cure
all
evils
but
like
physicians
worthy
of
their
trust
we
must
study
the
ailment
and
its
causes
and
above
all
must
we
study
the
patient
the
same
remedy
will
not
do
for
all
constitutions
therefore
the
punishment
must
not
only
fit
the
crime
but
it
must
also
be
made
to
fit
the
criminal
love
and
patience
are
the
secret
of
child
management
love
which
can
fare
from
the
chilliest
soul
patience
which
knows
how
to
wait
for
the
harvest
iii
when
your
child
imagines
things
johnny
was
playing
in
the
room
while
his
mother
was
sewing
at
the
window
johnny
looked
out
of
the
window
and
exclaimed
oh
mother
see
that
great
big
lion
his
mother
looked
but
saw
only
a
dog
why
johnny
replied
the
mother
how
can
you
say
such
a
thing
you
know
very
well
that
was
only
a
dog
now
go
right
in
the
corner
and
pray
to
god
to
forgive
you
for
telling
such
a
lie
johnny
went
when
he
came
back
he
said
triumphantly
see
mother
god
said
he
thought
it
was
a
lion
himself
this
poor
mother
is
a
typical
example
of
a
large
class
of
mothers
who
fail
to
understand
their
children
because
they
have
no
idea
of
what
goes
on
in
the
child
mind
to
johnny
the
lion
was
just
as
as
the
dog
was
to
the
mother
and
even
if
the
dog
had
not
been
there
for
the
mother
to
see
johnny
could
have
seen
just
as
real
a
lion
every
mother
ought
to
know
that
practically
every
healthy
child
has
imagination
you
will
have
to
take
a
long
day
journey
to
find
a
child
that
has
no
imagination
to
begin
with
and
then
you
will
find
that
this
child
is
wonderfully
uninteresting
or
actually
stupid
you
can
easily
observe
for
yourself
that
as
soon
as
a
child
knows
a
large
number
of
objects
and
persons
and
names
he
will
begin
to
rearrange
his
bits
of
knowledge
into
new
combinations
and
in
this
way
make
a
little
world
of
his
own
in
this
world
beasts
and
furniture
and
flowers
talk
and
have
adventures
when
the
dew
is
on
the
grass
the
grass
is
crying
butterflies
are
flying
pansies
lightning
is
the
sky
winking
and
so
on
this
activity
of
the
child
mind
begins
at
about
two
years
and
reaches
its
height
between
the
ages
of
four
and
six
but
it
continues
through
life
with
greater
or
less
intensity
according
to
circumstances
and
original
disposition
it
is
not
only
the
poet
and
artist
who
need
imagination
but
all
of
us
in
our
everyday
concerns
do
you
realize
that
the
person
to
whom
you
like
so
much
to
talk
about
your
affairs
because
she
is
so
sympathetic
because
she
has
imagination
for
without
imagination
we
can
not
put
ourselves
in
the
place
of
another
and
much
of
the
misery
in
the
relation
between
human
beings
exists
because
so
many
of
us
are
unable
to
do
this
the
happy
can
not
realize
the
needs
of
the
miserable
and
the
miserable
can
not
understand
why
anyone
should
be
happy
if
they
lack
imagination
the
need
for
imagination
far
from
being
confined
to
dreamers
and
persons
who
dwell
in
the
clouds
is
of
great
importance
in
the
development
of
mind
and
character
imagination
is
a
direct
help
in
learning
and
in
developing
sympathy
as
one
of
our
great
moral
leaders
felix
adler
has
said
much
of
the
selfishness
of
the
world
is
due
not
to
actual
but
to
lack
of
imaginative
power
we
all
know
the
classic
example
of
queen
marie
antoinette
who
when
told
that
the
people
were
rioting
for
want
of
bread
exclaimed
why
let
them
eat
cake
instead
brought
up
in
luxury
she
could
not
realize
what
absolute
want
means
she
had
no
imagination
the
world
has
progressed
but
we
still
have
among
us
the
same
type
of
unfortunate
persons
who
are
unable
to
put
themselves
in
the
place
of
others
i
recently
heard
of
a
woman
who
on
being
told
of
a
family
so
poor
that
they
had
had
nothing
but
cold
potatoes
for
supper
the
night
before
replied
they
may
be
poor
but
the
mother
must
be
a
very
bad
housekeeper
anyway
for
even
if
they
had
nothing
but
potatoes
to
eat
she
might
at
least
have
fried
them
like
her
royal
prototype
this
modern
woman
had
not
the
imagination
to
realize
that
a
family
could
be
so
poor
as
to
be
in
want
of
fuel
but
being
able
to
put
yourself
in
the
place
of
another
is
of
importance
not
only
from
the
strictly
moral
point
of
view
you
can
easily
see
how
it
will
affect
one
everyday
relations
how
it
will
be
of
great
help
in
avoiding
misunderstandings
of
all
kinds
as
between
mother
and
child
between
mistress
and
maid
etc
if
parents
would
only
realize
this
importance
of
imagination
and
not
look
upon
it
as
a
vain
thing
they
would
not
merely
the
child
imagination
to
take
its
own
course
they
would
actually
make
efforts
to
cultivate
and
encourage
it
in
this
way
they
would
not
only
aid
the
child
in
becoming
a
better
and
more
sympathetic
man
or
woman
but
would
also
add
much
to
the
happiness
of
the
child
unless
we
have
given
special
thought
to
this
matter
most
of
us
do
not
appreciate
how
very
real
the
child
world
of
is
to
him
and
how
essential
to
his
happiness
that
we
do
not
break
into
it
rudely
when
one
of
my
boys
was
two
and
a
half
years
old
he
was
one
day
playing
with
an
imaginary
baby
sister
a
member
of
the
household
came
into
the
room
whereupon
he
immediately
broke
out
in
wild
screaming
and
became
very
much
agitated
it
took
some
time
to
quiet
him
and
to
find
out
that
the
cause
of
all
his
trouble
was
the
fact
that
this
person
had
inadvertently
stepped
upon
his
imaginary
sister
whom
he
had
placed
upon
the
floor
before
him
he
saw
his
little
sister
crushed
and
great
were
his
horror
and
grief
i
know
from
this
experience
and
many
others
that
if
we
do
not
enter
into
the
child
world
and
try
to
understand
the
working
of
his
mind
we
will
often
find
him
naughty
when
he
is
not
naughty
at
all
in
the
example
given
it
would
have
been
very
easy
to
follow
the
first
impulse
to
reprove
the
child
for
what
seemed
very
unreasonable
conduct
on
his
part
and
such
cases
arise
constantly
how
completely
the
child
throws
himself
into
an
imaginary
character
is
shown
by
an
incident
which
occurred
recently
a
little
boy
of
four
who
had
been
accustomed
to
speak
only
german
at
home
was
playing
doctor
and
was
so
absorbed
in
the
play
that
when
came
he
was
loath
to
abandon
the
role
his
mother
to
avoid
delay
simply
said
i
think
we
will
invite
the
doctor
to
have
dinner
with
us
and
he
promptly
accepted
the
invitation
when
the
maid
came
in
he
said
in
english
what
is
her
name
marie
the
mother
replied
is
that
mary
in
english
the
child
politely
inquired
you
see
i
can
not
speak
german
for
my
mother
never
taught
me
and
although
this
little
boy
never
spoke
english
to
his
parents
nor
his
parents
to
him
as
doctor
he
spoke
english
throughout
the
meal
many
parents
enter
spontaneously
into
the
spirit
of
their
games
and
make
believe
with
the
best
of
them
they
pity
poor
johnny
when
he
screams
with
terror
at
the
attack
of
the
bear
and
take
great
joy
in
admiring
the
kitten
if
we
but
realized
how
all
this
make
believe
helps
in
the
development
of
character
and
in
the
gaining
of
knowledge
parents
would
try
to
develop
the
child
imagination
and
not
only
those
who
have
the
gift
intuitively
it
is
the
child
natural
way
of
learning
things
of
getting
acquainted
with
all
living
and
inanimate
objects
in
his
environment
it
sharpens
his
observation
a
child
who
tries
to
act
a
horse
for
example
will
be
much
more
apt
to
notice
all
the
different
activities
and
habits
of
the
horse
in
his
various
relations
than
a
child
who
merely
observes
passively
a
child
with
imagination
when
receiving
directions
or
instructions
can
picture
to
himself
what
he
is
expected
to
do
and
easily
translates
his
instructions
into
action
to
the
unimaginative
child
the
directions
given
will
be
so
many
words
and
he
can
not
carry
out
these
instructions
as
effectively
again
and
again
teachers
find
that
pupils
fail
to
carry
out
orders
though
able
when
asked
to
repeat
word
for
word
the
instructions
given
them
the
plaintive
inquiry
what
shall
i
do
now
is
much
more
frequently
heard
from
the
child
who
is
unimaginative
or
who
has
had
the
play
of
his
imagination
curbed
for
the
child
can
whatever
he
wishes
and
whatever
he
likes
his
desire
is
at
his
finger
end
once
his
imagination
is
free
the
can
be
a
great
big
ship
the
carpet
a
rolling
sea
and
at
most
a
suggestion
is
needed
from
the
busy
mother
a
few
chairs
can
be
a
train
of
cars
and
keep
him
occupied
for
hours
a
wooden
box
is
transformed
into
a
mighty
locomotive
in
fact
give
an
imaginative
child
almost
anything
a
string
of
beads
or
a
piece
of
colored
glass
and
out
of
it
his
imagination
will
construct
great
happiness
a
normal
child
does
not
need
elaborate
toys
the
only
function
of
a
toy
as
someone
has
well
said
is
to
serve
as
lay
figures
upon
which
the
child
imagination
can
weave
and
drape
its
fancy
although
parents
have
not
always
understood
what
goes
on
in
the
child
mind
when
he
is
so
busy
with
his
play
our
poets
and
lovers
of
children
have
had
a
deeper
insight
stevenson
in
his
poem
my
kingdom
shows
us
how
with
the
touch
of
imagination
the
child
transforms
the
commonplace
objects
of
his
surroundings
into
material
for
rich
romance
down
by
a
shining
water
well
i
found
a
very
little
dell
no
higher
than
my
head
the
heather
and
the
gorse
about
in
summer
bloom
were
coming
out
some
yellow
and
some
red
i
called
the
little
pool
a
sea
the
little
hills
were
big
to
me
for
i
am
very
small
i
made
boat
i
made
a
town
i
searched
the
caverns
up
and
down
and
named
them
one
and
all
and
all
about
was
mine
i
said
the
little
sparrows
overhead
the
little
minnows
too
this
was
the
world
and
i
was
king
for
me
the
bees
came
by
to
sing
for
me
the
swallows
flew
i
played
there
were
no
deeper
seas
nor
any
wilder
plains
than
these
nor
other
kings
than
me
at
last
i
hear
my
mother
call
out
from
the
house
at
evenfall
to
call
me
home
to
tea
and
i
must
rise
and
leave
my
dell
and
leave
my
dimpled
water
well
and
leave
my
heather
blooms
alas
and
as
my
home
i
neared
how
very
big
my
nurse
appeared
how
great
and
cool
the
rooms
some
children
do
not
even
need
as
a
starting
point
for
their
imaginative
activity
they
can
just
conjure
up
persons
and
things
to
serve
as
material
for
their
play
many
children
when
alone
have
imaginary
companions
one
little
boy
when
taken
out
for
his
airing
daily
met
an
imaginary
friend
whom
he
called
buster
as
soon
as
he
stepped
out
of
the
house
he
uttered
a
peculiar
call
to
which
buster
replied
though
no
one
but
he
heard
him
and
he
would
run
to
meet
him
and
they
would
have
a
lovely
time
together
sometimes
for
hours
at
a
stretch
another
little
child
received
a
daily
visit
from
an
imaginary
cow
there
was
a
certain
place
in
the
where
this
red
cow
with
white
spots
would
appear
the
child
would
go
through
the
motions
of
feeding
her
patting
her
and
bringing
her
water
in
these
two
cases
the
companionship
lasted
but
a
few
months
but
there
are
children
whose
imaginary
companions
grow
up
with
them
and
get
older
as
they
get
older
illustration
imagination
supplies
this
a
prancing
steed
in
some
instances
there
is
a
group
of
such
imaginary
companions
and
their
activities
constitute
a
continued
story
of
which
the
child
is
a
living
centre
although
not
necessarily
the
hero
it
seems
to
me
that
the
power
to
create
his
own
friends
must
be
a
great
boon
to
a
child
who
is
forced
to
be
alone
a
great
deal
or
has
no
congenial
companions
there
need
be
no
fear
except
perhaps
in
very
extreme
cases
that
such
activity
of
the
imagination
is
morbid
a
little
girl
who
plays
with
her
dolls
is
really
doing
the
same
thing
only
that
she
has
a
symbol
for
each
of
her
imaginary
companions
but
although
an
imaginative
child
is
much
easier
to
teach
later
on
and
although
he
does
not
trouble
you
with
the
incessant
nagging
what
shall
i
do
now
the
mother
whose
idea
of
good
conduct
is
keeping
quiet
will
find
the
unimaginative
child
much
easier
to
care
for
he
is
very
much
less
active
and
therefore
less
troublesome
this
explains
why
this
priceless
gift
of
imagination
has
so
often
been
discouraged
by
parents
and
teachers
but
they
did
not
know
that
they
were
actually
the
child
by
so
discouraging
him
or
let
us
hope
they
would
not
have
chosen
the
easier
way
for
after
all
we
are
not
looking
for
the
easiest
way
of
getting
along
with
children
but
for
the
best
and
the
best
for
them
will
prove
in
the
end
to
be
the
best
for
us
it
must
certainly
try
your
patience
when
you
are
tired
at
the
end
of
a
day
work
to
have
harry
refuse
to
come
to
be
put
to
bed
because
you
called
him
harry
and
he
replies
perhaps
somewhat
crossly
i
am
not
harry
i
told
you
i
am
little
jack
horner
and
i
have
to
sit
in
my
corner
but
no
matter
how
hard
it
may
seem
do
not
get
discouraged
once
you
are
fully
aware
of
the
importance
of
what
seems
to
be
but
silly
play
you
will
add
this
one
more
to
your
many
sacrifices
and
find
that
it
will
bring
returns
a
hundredfold
and
after
all
as
in
so
many
other
problems
when
you
resolve
to
make
the
sacrifice
it
turns
out
to
be
no
sacrifice
for
once
you
approach
the
problem
in
an
understanding
spirit
the
flights
of
the
child
imagination
will
give
you
untold
pleasure
another
reason
why
imagination
has
been
suppressed
by
those
who
are
in
charge
of
children
is
the
fear
that
it
will
lead
to
the
formation
of
habits
of
untruthfulness
it
is
very
hard
to
realize
unless
you
understand
the
child
nature
that
the
child
is
not
lying
when
he
says
something
that
is
manifestly
not
so
to
you
and
the
other
adults
i
have
heard
children
reproved
for
lying
when
i
was
sure
that
they
had
no
idea
of
what
a
lie
is
in
one
family
an
older
boy
broke
a
plate
and
when
charged
with
the
deed
denied
it
flatly
his
little
brother
however
confessed
and
described
just
how
he
had
broken
it
now
the
older
boy
was
telling
a
falsehood
consciously
probably
from
fear
of
punishment
the
little
fellow
however
was
not
telling
an
untruth
from
his
point
of
view
he
really
imagined
having
broken
that
plate
he
had
heard
the
event
discussed
by
the
family
until
all
the
incidents
were
vivid
to
him
and
he
pictured
himself
as
the
hero
up
to
a
certain
time
it
is
impossible
for
the
child
to
distinguish
between
what
we
call
and
his
both
are
equally
real
to
him
and
the
is
ever
so
much
more
interesting
until
about
the
fifth
year
a
child
does
not
know
that
he
is
imagining
between
the
ages
of
four
and
six
the
imaginative
period
is
at
its
height
and
there
begins
to
appear
a
sort
of
undercurrent
of
consciousness
that
it
is
all
and
this
heightens
the
pleasure
of
trying
to
make
it
seem
real
gradually
the
child
learns
to
distinguish
between
imaginary
experiences
and
real
ones
but
until
you
are
quite
certain
that
he
distinguish
do
not
attach
any
moral
significance
to
his
stories
should
an
older
child
be
inclined
to
tell
falsehoods
you
may
be
sure
that
this
is
because
his
imagination
has
been
cultivated
there
are
then
other
reasons
and
causes
and
they
must
be
studied
on
their
own
account
after
you
come
to
a
clear
appreciation
of
the
value
of
imagination
in
the
child
development
you
will
instead
of
suppressing
his
feelings
look
around
for
ways
of
encouraging
this
activity
of
his
mind
you
will
see
a
new
value
in
fairy
tales
and
fables
and
a
new
significance
in
every
turn
of
his
fancy
iv
the
lies
children
tell
none
of
the
petty
vices
of
childhood
appears
to
shock
adults
so
much
as
lying
and
none
is
more
widespread
among
children
and
among
adults
as
we
are
speaking
of
children
however
it
is
enough
to
say
that
all
children
lie
constantly
persistently
universally
perhaps
you
will
be
less
grieved
by
the
lies
of
your
children
and
less
loath
to
admit
that
they
do
lie
if
you
realize
that
children
lie
the
mother
who
tells
you
that
her
child
never
lies
is
either
deceiving
herself
or
trying
to
impress
you
with
the
superiority
of
her
in
her
case
the
untruthfulness
of
childhood
has
not
been
remedied
however
although
lying
is
so
common
that
is
no
reason
for
ignoring
the
lies
of
children
they
have
to
be
taught
to
know
the
truth
and
to
speak
it
and
to
act
it
and
they
can
be
taught
the
psalmist
said
all
men
are
liars
but
he
spoke
hastily
as
he
afterward
learned
all
of
us
are
probably
born
with
instincts
that
make
it
easy
for
us
to
acquire
the
art
of
lying
but
we
have
also
the
instincts
that
make
us
love
the
truth
and
speak
it
indeed
a
child
may
acquire
a
hatred
of
untruth
that
is
so
keen
as
to
be
positively
distressing
and
this
condition
is
just
as
morbid
and
undesirable
as
that
of
the
other
extreme
which
accepts
lies
as
the
usual
thing
as
in
other
problems
connected
with
the
bringing
up
of
children
the
first
and
the
last
aim
should
be
to
understand
the
child
the
individual
particular
child
will
your
child
become
a
habitual
liar
or
will
he
simply
outgrow
the
tendency
toward
untruthfulness
as
he
will
leave
other
childish
things
behind
him
it
is
impossible
to
tell
but
for
the
vast
majority
of
children
a
great
deal
depends
upon
the
kind
of
treatment
given
if
you
do
not
treat
the
lies
of
your
children
there
is
the
danger
that
you
will
bring
out
other
characteristics
perhaps
even
more
undesirable
ones
such
as
cruelty
vindictiveness
or
even
we
must
recognize
that
there
is
no
general
faculty
of
lying
it
is
very
easy
for
us
to
class
as
every
word
and
every
act
that
is
not
in
complete
harmony
with
the
facts
as
we
understand
them
but
there
are
many
kinds
of
lies
as
well
as
many
degrees
of
them
a
child
that
is
branded
a
liar
has
undoubtedly
given
abundant
occasion
for
mistrust
and
has
lied
aplenty
but
undoubtedly
also
he
has
specialized
in
his
lying
and
would
be
incapable
of
certain
kinds
of
lies
that
are
common
enough
with
other
children
as
we
are
the
judges
of
our
children
in
all
of
their
misdeeds
we
must
preserve
not
only
a
judicious
attitude
but
we
must
really
be
and
to
this
end
it
is
essential
that
we
take
into
consideration
all
the
circumstances
that
lead
to
a
lie
including
the
motives
as
well
as
the
special
traits
of
the
particular
child
the
first
thing
that
we
should
keep
always
in
mind
is
that
the
moral
character
of
the
child
is
still
unformed
and
that
his
standards
of
truth
like
his
other
standards
are
not
the
same
as
those
of
the
adult
indeed
this
fact
is
at
the
same
time
the
hope
of
childhood
and
the
source
of
its
many
tragedies
it
is
the
hope
because
the
child
is
and
acquiring
new
vision
and
new
powers
the
child
of
is
the
adult
of
and
most
of
the
children
of
will
be
at
least
as
developed
in
time
as
the
adults
of
the
tragedy
arises
from
the
fact
that
as
we
grow
older
we
forget
the
outlook
of
the
child
and
misunderstandings
between
the
parents
and
the
children
are
almost
inevitable
whatever
the
prevailing
morality
of
a
community
may
demand
the
fact
remains
that
practically
all
children
up
to
a
certain
age
consider
it
perfectly
legitimate
to
lie
to
their
enemies
if
they
but
tell
the
truth
to
their
friends
children
may
lie
to
the
policeman
or
to
the
teacher
or
to
anyone
with
whom
they
are
for
the
moment
in
conflict
this
is
a
relic
of
the
time
when
our
savage
ancestors
found
it
necessary
to
practice
deceit
in
order
to
save
themselves
from
their
enemies
so
ingrained
is
this
instinct
that
many
a
child
will
stick
to
a
falsehood
before
the
teacher
or
other
inquisitors
only
to
retract
and
go
to
pieces
when
obliged
to
answer
his
mother
it
has
been
shown
over
and
over
again
that
children
even
well
along
in
the
teens
consider
it
quite
right
to
tell
one
story
to
a
teacher
or
to
another
child
who
is
disliked
and
a
different
story
to
one
that
is
liked
this
attitude
probably
arises
not
so
much
from
a
desire
to
deceive
as
an
outcome
of
natural
cunning
and
adaptability
this
is
illustrated
by
the
little
girl
who
used
to
throw
the
crust
of
her
bread
under
the
table
to
get
more
soft
bread
the
child
was
too
young
to
deceive
anyone
she
could
not
possibly
have
the
idea
of
deceit
or
of
lying
she
had
simply
come
to
dispose
of
the
crust
in
this
way
because
she
had
associated
the
arrival
of
more
bread
with
her
to
throw
the
bread
under
the
table
was
a
direct
way
to
the
getting
of
what
she
wanted
the
question
of
truth
or
untruth
never
entered
the
little
mind
to
treat
this
child
as
a
liar
would
not
only
be
unjust
but
would
be
apt
to
make
the
child
conscious
of
the
idea
of
deceit
later
in
his
development
the
child
may
still
use
the
same
kind
of
cunning
in
getting
what
he
wants
or
in
escaping
what
he
does
not
like
without
the
intention
to
deceive
and
a
lie
to
be
a
lie
must
include
that
intention
all
students
of
child
nature
agree
that
a
very
young
child
say
before
the
age
of
four
or
five
does
not
lie
consciously
later
the
child
may
say
many
things
that
are
not
so
but
gradually
he
comes
to
recognize
the
difference
between
what
he
says
and
what
is
really
so
he
may
need
help
in
coming
to
see
the
difference
but
this
aid
should
not
be
forced
upon
him
too
soon
a
little
boy
of
five
who
was
very
imaginative
became
acquainted
with
some
older
children
in
a
new
neighborhood
who
had
little
imagination
and
therefore
were
greatly
shocked
by
herbert
stories
they
proceeded
to
inform
him
that
he
was
lying
and
to
explain
to
him
what
a
lie
was
the
boy
was
very
much
impressed
after
he
came
home
he
discovered
that
there
was
a
great
deal
of
lying
going
on
he
asked
his
little
brother
are
you
older
than
me
to
which
the
little
one
answered
in
the
affirmative
herbert
came
running
to
his
mother
to
report
that
the
baby
had
told
a
lie
for
several
weeks
everything
that
was
said
was
subject
to
the
child
severe
scrutiny
every
slightest
mistake
was
at
once
labelled
by
him
as
a
lie
richard
said
is
my
right
hand
that
is
a
lie
helen
said
i
may
not
play
with
the
hammer
mother
said
i
may
so
helen
lied
the
maid
said
it
was
time
to
go
to
bed
but
it
is
only
five
minutes
to
seven
so
the
maid
lied
and
he
would
delight
especially
in
asking
the
baby
brother
leading
questions
to
trap
him
into
saying
lies
this
experience
did
not
result
in
making
herbert
any
more
scrupulous
in
his
own
speech
for
his
imagination
created
interesting
and
dramatic
situations
which
he
described
with
zeal
and
enthusiasm
for
a
long
time
after
he
had
discovered
lies
the
young
child
is
really
incapable
of
distinguishing
between
his
dreams
and
reality
on
the
one
hand
and
between
reality
and
his
or
imaginings
on
the
other
a
little
boy
came
home
from
kindergarten
a
few
days
after
he
had
entered
and
when
the
experience
was
still
full
of
novelties
to
him
he
described
the
workshop
each
little
boy
had
a
pair
of
overalls
with
the
name
across
the
bib
in
black
letters
there
was
a
little
locker
for
each
child
with
the
name
on
the
outside
each
had
his
set
of
tools
and
his
place
at
the
bench
day
by
day
he
narrated
his
doings
in
school
and
reported
the
progress
he
was
making
with
a
little
box
that
he
intended
for
his
aunt
birthday
on
the
birthday
the
mother
came
to
the
school
to
see
how
the
boy
was
getting
on
and
she
asked
about
the
box
which
he
was
now
to
bring
home
it
then
appeared
that
there
was
no
shop
no
overalls
no
lockers
no
tools
the
whole
story
was
a
creation
of
the
child
imagination
and
all
the
details
he
had
invented
were
real
enough
to
him
to
be
described
repeatedly
with
such
vividness
that
no
one
suspected
for
a
moment
that
it
was
all
a
fabrication
to
call
such
stories
lies
would
be
worse
than
useless
if
scolding
or
preaching
could
make
a
child
merely
stop
such
stories
there
would
be
no
gain
if
they
stopped
a
child
such
stories
there
would
be
a
decided
loss
gradually
the
child
may
come
to
recognize
the
difference
between
the
and
the
reality
and
he
may
be
helped
when
at
a
certain
age
you
think
your
child
ought
to
distinguish
more
clearly
between
his
imagination
and
cold
facts
it
would
be
all
right
to
explain
to
him
that
although
there
is
no
harm
in
his
enjoying
his
still
he
must
not
tell
his
fancies
as
if
they
were
real
but
must
tell
them
as
stories
that
will
achieve
the
desired
result
without
making
him
feel
hurt
at
your
lack
of
understanding
in
treating
him
like
an
ordinary
liar
whose
prime
intention
is
to
deceive
but
it
is
not
wise
to
force
this
development
even
at
the
risk
of
prolonging
the
age
of
dreams
with
some
children
lying
is
caused
by
their
esthetic
feelings
it
is
much
easier
for
them
to
describe
a
situation
as
they
feel
it
should
have
been
than
to
describe
it
as
it
actually
was
many
children
embellish
the
facts
without
any
trace
of
intent
to
deceive
although
we
recognize
that
what
they
say
is
not
strictly
the
truth
we
must
further
recognize
that
it
is
their
love
of
the
beautiful
or
their
sense
of
the
fitness
of
things
that
leads
them
to
these
exaggerations
it
is
the
same
sort
of
instinct
as
shows
itself
in
our
love
of
certain
kinds
of
fiction
we
know
that
some
of
the
happy
endings
in
the
plays
and
in
the
novels
are
often
but
we
like
to
have
the
happy
endings
or
the
poetic
justice
endings
or
the
irony
of
fate
endings
just
the
same
when
the
child
makes
up
his
endings
to
fit
his
sense
of
justice
or
beauty
we
must
not
condemn
him
as
we
are
often
tempted
to
do
by
calling
his
fabrication
a
lie
for
that
at
once
puts
it
in
the
same
class
as
deliberate
deceit
for
a
selfish
purpose
there
is
really
no
harm
in
this
class
of
lies
unless
as
the
child
grows
older
it
becomes
apparent
that
he
lets
his
wishes
and
preferences
interfere
with
his
vision
of
what
is
actually
going
on
in
such
cases
the
remedy
is
not
to
be
found
in
the
denunciation
of
lying
but
in
giving
the
child
opportunity
to
experience
realities
that
can
not
be
treated
untruthfully
to
this
end
various
kinds
of
hand
work
and
scientific
study
have
been
useful
it
is
impossible
for
the
child
to
cheat
the
tools
of
the
workshop
or
his
instruments
of
precision
it
is
impossible
to
make
a
spool
of
thread
do
the
work
of
two
or
three
or
one
can
not
make
the
paint
go
farther
by
applying
the
brush
faster
it
is
concrete
reality
that
can
teach
the
imaginative
child
reality
in
the
things
he
learns
from
books
there
is
no
check
upon
the
imagined
and
the
desired
one
kind
of
outcome
is
as
likely
and
as
true
as
another
but
in
the
experience
of
the
workaday
world
causes
and
consequences
can
not
be
so
easily
altered
by
a
trick
of
words
investigation
has
shown
that
the
sentimental
or
heroic
element
is
one
that
appeals
to
children
so
strongly
that
it
may
often
lead
to
what
we
adults
would
call
lies
or
it
would
seem
to
the
child
to
justify
lying
the
confession
to
a
deed
that
he
has
not
committed
for
the
purpose
of
saving
a
weaker
companion
from
punishment
or
injury
seems
to
be
a
type
of
lie
that
appeals
strongly
to
most
children
again
and
again
have
boys
and
girls
too
declared
stoically
that
they
were
guilty
of
some
dereliction
of
which
they
were
quite
innocent
to
shield
a
friend
and
most
children
not
only
admire
such
acts
but
will
seek
to
defend
them
on
moral
grounds
even
when
they
are
old
enough
to
know
what
a
is
the
explanation
for
this
is
to
be
found
in
the
fact
that
the
child
sees
every
situation
or
problem
as
a
whole
he
has
not
yet
learned
to
separate
problems
into
their
component
parts
a
situation
is
to
him
all
wrong
or
all
right
he
can
not
see
that
a
part
may
be
wrong
while
another
part
is
right
now
in
the
case
of
the
culprits
the
magnanimity
and
heroism
of
the
act
stand
out
so
prominently
that
they
quite
overshadow
the
trifling
circumstance
that
the
hero
did
do
the
wicked
deed
an
excellent
illustration
of
this
trait
of
child
nature
came
out
in
an
inquiry
that
was
made
a
number
of
years
ago
a
child
replied
in
answer
to
the
question
when
would
a
lie
be
justified
that
if
the
mother
life
depended
upon
it
one
would
have
the
moral
duty
of
saying
that
she
was
out
although
she
was
really
in
that
is
it
would
be
one
duty
to
make
the
great
moral
of
speaking
an
untruth
for
the
sake
of
saving
the
mother
any
child
will
tell
you
as
did
this
one
that
it
would
be
wicked
to
tell
a
lie
to
save
his
own
life
this
suggests
another
type
of
lie
that
is
quite
common
most
children
feel
their
personal
loyalties
so
keenly
that
they
would
do
many
things
that
they
themselves
consider
wrong
for
a
person
they
love
or
admire
a
little
girl
was
so
much
impressed
with
the
moral
teachings
of
her
teacher
that
she
was
determined
to
get
her
a
suitable
christmas
present
now
the
family
had
not
the
means
to
supply
such
a
present
and
mary
knew
it
and
was
greatly
distressed
by
the
fact
however
where
there
is
a
will
there
is
a
way
and
mary
found
the
way
by
cunningly
stealing
a
moustache
cup
from
a
store
with
the
inspiring
legend
to
dear
father
and
beautiful
red
and
blue
roses
and
gilt
leaves
mary
had
learned
that
it
was
wicked
to
steal
and
to
lie
but
her
heart
was
set
on
getting
something
for
the
teacher
not
for
herself
and
she
very
unselfishly
risked
her
moral
salvation
for
the
person
she
loved
and
admired
it
is
probably
better
for
the
child
if
we
do
not
push
the
analysis
of
acts
and
motives
too
early
for
there
is
more
danger
at
a
certain
age
from
morbid
than
from
acquiring
vicious
habits
if
we
recognize
that
many
of
the
lapses
from
the
paths
of
truth
arise
from
really
worthy
motives
we
must
make
sure
that
these
ideals
become
fixed
before
we
attempt
to
separate
the
unworthy
act
from
the
commendable
purpose
the
cases
so
far
given
show
how
important
it
is
to
retain
not
only
the
affection
but
also
the
confidence
of
our
children
and
how
important
it
is
to
have
right
teachers
and
associates
the
child
will
do
what
he
can
to
please
those
he
really
likes
or
admires
but
the
kind
of
thing
he
will
do
will
depend
a
great
deal
upon
what
those
he
admires
themselves
like
to
see
done
there
are
some
lies
that
are
due
to
faulty
observation
we
do
not
often
realize
to
what
extent
we
supplement
our
sense
perceptions
in
relating
our
experiences
lawyers
tell
us
that
it
is
very
difficult
to
have
a
witness
relate
what
he
saw
he
is
always
adding
details
for
completing
the
story
in
accordance
with
his
of
what
he
saw
this
is
not
lying
in
any
sense
but
it
is
relating
as
alleged
facts
what
are
in
reality
conclusions
from
facts
one
may
be
an
unreliable
witness
without
being
a
liar
and
so
may
the
child
tell
us
things
that
we
know
are
not
so
because
in
trying
to
tell
a
complete
story
he
has
to
supplement
what
he
actually
saw
with
what
he
feels
have
been
a
part
of
the
incident
defects
of
judgment
as
well
as
delusions
of
the
senses
or
lapses
of
memory
may
lead
to
misstatements
that
are
not
really
lies
some
delusions
of
the
senses
especially
of
sight
and
of
hearing
undoubtedly
have
a
physical
cause
another
source
of
comparatively
harmless
lying
is
the
instinct
for
secretiveness
children
just
love
to
have
secrets
and
if
there
are
none
on
hand
they
have
to
be
invented
a
child
will
tell
another
a
secret
on
condition
that
it
be
kept
a
secret
but
when
the
secret
is
told
it
turns
out
to
be
a
falsehood
perhaps
even
something
libellous
now
the
child
can
not
feel
that
he
has
done
anything
wicked
for
to
his
mind
the
big
thing
is
that
nellie
promised
not
to
tell
and
she
broke
her
promise
if
she
had
not
broken
her
promise
to
keep
the
secret
it
never
would
have
come
out
and
no
harm
would
have
been
done
perhaps
we
have
not
yet
sufficiently
driven
secrets
from
our
common
life
to
demand
that
the
children
shall
be
without
secrets
when
we
set
the
children
an
example
of
perfect
frankness
and
open
dealing
in
all
matters
we
may
perhaps
be
in
a
position
to
discourage
the
invention
of
secrets
by
the
young
people
secretiveness
leads
naturally
to
deceit
but
it
is
not
in
itself
serious
enough
to
make
much
ado
about
healthy
children
in
healthful
social
surroundings
will
outgrow
this
instinct
where
the
atmosphere
is
charged
with
intrigue
and
scheming
and
dissimulation
this
instinct
may
survive
longer
but
its
manifestation
is
in
itself
not
a
trait
that
should
give
its
concern
some
children
lie
because
they
are
inclined
to
brag
or
show
off
others
for
just
the
opposite
reason
they
are
too
sensitive
or
timid
and
a
lie
that
comes
from
either
side
of
the
child
nature
can
not
be
taken
as
a
sign
of
moral
depravity
the
treatment
which
a
child
is
given
must
take
into
consideration
the
child
temperament
charles
darwin
tells
of
his
own
inclination
to
make
exaggerated
statements
for
the
purpose
of
causing
a
sensation
i
told
another
little
boy
he
writes
in
his
autobiography
that
i
could
produce
polyanthuses
and
primroses
by
watering
them
with
certain
colored
fluids
which
was
of
course
a
monstrous
fable
and
had
never
been
tried
by
me
i
may
here
also
confess
that
as
a
little
boy
i
was
much
given
to
inventing
deliberate
falsehoods
and
this
was
always
done
for
the
sake
of
causing
excitement
for
instance
i
once
gathered
much
valuable
fruit
from
my
father
trees
and
hid
it
in
the
shrubbery
and
then
ran
in
breathless
haste
to
spread
the
news
that
i
had
discovered
a
hoard
of
stolen
fruit
for
the
vaunting
lie
it
is
usually
sufficient
to
defeat
its
purpose
by
showing
that
the
boast
can
not
be
carried
out
the
braggart
is
made
to
descend
from
the
pedestal
of
the
hero
to
the
level
of
the
fool
how
the
other
extreme
in
disposition
may
lead
to
a
lie
is
shown
by
the
little
girl
who
was
sent
to
the
store
for
a
loaf
of
bread
and
came
back
saying
that
there
was
no
more
to
be
had
the
mother
was
very
sure
that
that
could
not
be
but
soon
found
out
on
questioning
that
the
child
had
forgotten
what
she
was
sent
to
get
and
was
then
afraid
of
being
ridiculed
for
having
forgotten
here
the
cause
of
the
lie
was
timidity
to
punish
this
child
would
only
make
her
more
timid
in
a
case
of
this
kind
the
mother
should
try
to
cultivate
the
of
the
child
instead
of
punishing
her
for
untruthfulness
perhaps
the
most
common
kind
of
lie
is
the
one
that
a
child
tells
in
order
to
escape
punishment
it
is
often
chosen
as
the
easiest
way
without
realization
of
any
serious
and
even
when
a
child
is
taught
the
wrong
of
it
it
is
still
too
helpful
to
be
entirely
dropped
as
a
little
boy
once
said
a
lie
is
an
abomination
to
the
lord
and
an
help
in
time
of
trouble
the
first
lie
of
this
kind
that
a
child
invents
comes
without
any
feeling
of
moral
he
has
only
an
instinctive
shrinking
from
pain
to
cure
a
child
of
this
kind
of
lie
we
must
take
his
disposition
into
consideration
there
is
no
one
remedy
that
suits
all
children
in
some
cases
it
has
worked
very
well
to
develop
the
courage
of
the
child
so
that
he
will
fearlessly
accept
the
consequences
of
his
deeds
we
all
know
of
cases
where
children
can
be
physically
very
brave
and
stand
a
great
deal
of
pain
if
they
are
made
to
see
the
necessity
for
it
as
when
they
are
treated
by
a
dentist
or
physician
children
of
that
type
surely
can
be
taught
to
be
brave
also
about
accepting
the
consequences
of
misdeeds
with
another
type
of
child
the
desired
result
can
be
obtained
by
making
him
see
that
he
will
be
happier
and
that
his
relations
with
others
will
he
pleasanter
if
he
always
tells
the
truth
in
some
children
the
sense
of
honor
can
be
very
easily
aroused
and
they
can
be
made
to
see
how
truthfulness
and
reliability
help
human
beings
to
get
along
with
each
other
in
their
various
relations
a
great
many
temptations
for
this
kind
of
lie
can
be
entirely
avoided
if
your
child
feels
from
earliest
infancy
that
you
always
treat
him
justly
yet
a
child
who
is
neither
afraid
of
punishment
nor
inclined
to
deceive
may
often
be
tempted
to
lie
when
his
wits
are
challenged
there
is
something
about
your
tone
of
voice
or
in
the
manner
of
asking
who
left
the
door
of
the
open
that
is
an
irresistible
temptation
to
make
you
show
how
smart
you
really
are
you
think
you
know
and
your
manner
shows
it
but
you
may
be
mistaken
and
your
cocksureness
arouses
all
the
cunning
and
combativeness
of
the
child
there
is
a
vague
feeling
in
his
mind
that
he
would
like
to
see
you
confirm
your
suspicion
without
the
aid
of
an
open
confession
and
the
result
is
a
lie
indeed
any
approach
that
arouses
antagonisms
is
almost
sure
to
bring
out
the
propensity
to
dissimulate
or
even
to
deceive
in
such
cases
the
mother
should
learn
how
to
approach
the
child
without
a
challenge
instead
of
trying
to
teach
the
child
not
to
lie
the
worst
kind
of
lies
are
those
caused
by
selfishness
or
the
desire
to
gain
at
the
expense
of
another
or
those
prompted
by
malice
or
envy
or
the
passion
for
vengeance
although
such
lies
often
appear
in
the
games
of
children
the
games
themselves
are
not
to
be
held
responsible
for
this
indeed
the
games
of
the
older
children
when
played
under
suitable
direction
are
likely
to
be
among
the
best
means
for
remedying
untruthfulness
yet
it
may
be
wise
sometimes
to
keep
a
child
from
his
games
for
a
time
not
so
much
to
punish
him
for
lying
as
to
give
him
an
opportunity
to
reflect
on
the
close
connection
between
truthfulness
and
good
playing
special
instruction
may
sometimes
be
needed
as
a
means
to
arousing
the
conscience
the
lies
of
selfishness
are
bad
because
if
continued
they
are
likely
to
make
children
grasping
and
unscrupulous
but
it
is
in
most
cases
wiser
to
try
to
make
the
child
more
generous
and
frank
than
to
fix
the
attention
on
the
lies
if
he
can
be
made
to
realize
that
his
happiness
is
more
likely
to
be
assured
through
friendly
and
sincere
relations
the
temptation
to
use
lies
will
be
reduced
one
type
of
lying
that
is
very
irritating
and
very
hard
to
meet
is
that
known
as
prevarication
this
consists
in
telling
a
part
of
a
truth
or
even
a
whole
truth
in
such
a
way
as
to
convey
a
false
impression
and
is
most
common
at
about
twelve
or
thirteen
years
when
a
child
resorts
to
prevarication
he
is
already
old
enough
to
know
the
difference
between
a
truthful
statement
and
a
false
statement
indeed
it
is
when
he
most
keenly
realizes
this
that
he
is
most
likely
to
prevaricate
for
this
is
but
a
device
by
which
the
childish
mind
attempts
to
achieve
an
indirect
purpose
and
at
the
same
time
keep
his
peace
with
his
conscience
it
is
when
he
already
has
a
certain
fear
of
lying
and
is
not
yet
thoroughly
sincere
and
that
he
will
come
home
from
the
truant
fishing
party
and
ingeniously
tell
you
that
a
friend
of
harry
caught
the
fish
instead
of
saying
that
he
himself
did
it
his
conscience
is
quite
satisfied
with
the
reflection
that
he
a
friend
of
harry
in
this
stage
of
his
career
the
child
is
quite
capable
of
understanding
a
direct
analysis
of
what
is
essentially
a
deception
and
a
good
talk
that
comes
to
a
conclusion
is
about
the
best
thing
he
can
get
i
hope
you
will
not
think
from
what
i
have
said
that
i
have
been
trying
to
justify
lying
or
that
i
do
not
consider
lying
a
serious
matter
nor
on
the
other
hand
that
you
will
consider
a
single
application
of
the
remedies
suggested
sufficient
to
make
any
child
truthful
thoroughgoing
truthfulness
comes
hard
and
generally
comes
late
but
for
the
majority
of
children
truthfulness
is
attainable
although
it
will
not
be
attained
without
a
struggle
the
finer
instincts
often
enough
lead
to
violations
of
strict
veracity
but
they
may
be
made
also
to
strengthen
the
feeling
of
scrupulous
regard
for
the
truth
i
have
tried
to
show
that
what
we
call
a
lie
is
always
a
lie
and
that
some
of
the
very
methods
we
use
in
training
our
children
themselves
produce
lies
the
inflicting
of
severe
punishments
is
one
of
the
chief
of
these
and
the
most
common
lie
is
that
which
is
due
to
fear
of
punishment
lies
that
arise
from
bad
habits
should
be
treated
by
an
attempt
to
remedy
the
bad
habit
lies
that
arise
from
ignorance
should
be
treated
by
attention
to
necessary
knowledge
even
more
important
than
the
right
kind
of
treatment
for
untruthfulness
is
the
necessity
for
an
atmosphere
in
which
the
spirit
of
truthfulness
is
some
day
watch
yourself
and
notice
how
often
you
tell
untruths
to
your
child
how
often
he
hears
you
tell
white
lies
to
your
neighbors
how
often
he
hears
you
prevaricate
and
exaggerate
if
you
will
keep
track
of
these
things
you
will
realize
that
it
is
a
trifle
absurd
of
you
to
expect
your
child
to
be
a
strict
speaker
of
the
truth
part
of
our
campaign
against
the
lies
of
our
children
must
therefore
consist
in
our
attempt
to
establish
truthful
relations
among
adults
and
between
adults
and
children
being
afraid
the
heroes
of
history
and
the
heroes
of
fiction
whom
all
of
us
like
to
admire
are
the
men
and
women
who
know
no
fear
but
most
of
us
make
use
of
fear
as
a
cheap
device
for
attaining
immediate
results
with
our
children
when
johnny
hesitates
about
going
upstairs
in
the
dark
to
fetch
your
you
remind
him
of
columbus
who
braved
the
trackless
sea
and
the
unknown
void
in
the
west
and
you
exhort
him
to
be
a
man
but
when
johnny
was
younger
you
yourself
warned
him
that
the
bogeyman
would
get
him
if
be
did
not
go
right
to
sleep
and
it
is
not
very
long
since
the
day
when
he
tried
to
climb
the
cherry
tree
and
you
attempted
to
dissuade
him
with
the
alarming
prophecy
that
he
would
surely
fall
down
and
break
his
neck
thus
our
training
consists
of
countless
contradictions
we
set
up
noble
ideals
to
arouse
courage
and
when
that
suits
our
immediate
purpose
and
we
frighten
with
threats
and
warn
of
calamity
when
the
child
has
the
impulse
to
do
what
we
do
not
wish
to
have
him
do
this
at
once
suggests
the
effect
of
fear
upon
character
and
conduct
we
instinctively
call
upon
courage
when
we
want
the
child
something
we
call
upon
fear
when
we
want
to
in
other
words
bravery
stimulates
whereas
fear
paralyzes
the
human
race
is
characterized
by
an
instinct
of
fear
very
young
infants
exhibit
all
the
symptoms
of
fear
long
before
they
can
have
any
knowledge
or
experience
of
the
disagreeable
and
the
harmful
effects
of
the
things
that
frighten
them
thus
a
sudden
noise
will
make
the
child
start
and
tremble
and
even
scream
and
all
through
life
an
unexpected
and
loud
noise
is
likely
to
startle
us
an
investigation
has
shown
that
thunder
is
feared
much
more
than
lightning
children
will
laugh
at
the
flashes
of
lightning
but
will
cower
before
the
roaring
thunder
the
feeling
of
fear
is
closely
associated
with
what
is
it
is
not
noise
in
general
that
frightens
the
children
but
an
unexpected
noise
from
an
unknown
source
indeed
the
children
like
noise
itself
well
enough
to
produce
it
whenever
they
can
by
heating
drums
or
barrels
or
the
frightful
thing
about
thunder
is
that
the
cause
remains
a
mystery
and
it
is
frightful
so
long
as
the
cause
remain
a
mystery
if
the
child
lives
to
be
a
hundred
years
old
during
a
children
will
picture
to
themselves
a
battle
going
on
above
some
think
of
the
sky
cracking
or
the
moon
bursting
or
conceive
of
the
firmament
as
a
dome
of
metal
over
which
balls
are
being
rolled
illustration
neither
are
girls
afraid
to
climb
the
influence
of
the
unknown
explains
also
why
that
other
great
source
of
fear
namely
darkness
has
such
a
strange
hold
upon
children
fear
of
darkness
is
very
common
and
often
very
intense
there
are
but
few
children
who
do
not
suffer
from
it
at
some
time
and
to
some
extent
this
fear
is
frequently
suggested
by
stories
of
robbers
ghosts
or
other
terrors
but
even
children
who
have
been
carefully
guarded
sometimes
have
these
violent
fears
that
can
not
be
reasoned
away
in
order
to
discover
what
it
is
about
the
darkness
that
frightens
children
a
large
number
of
women
and
men
were
asked
to
recall
their
childish
experiences
with
fear
and
from
the
many
instances
given
the
following
may
be
used
to
illustrate
the
various
terrors
of
the
dark
one
woman
described
her
fears
of
an
indistinct
living
something
black
possibly
curly
which
she
feared
would
enter
the
room
in
the
darkness
from
somewhere
under
the
bed
another
could
see
dark
objects
with
eyes
and
teeth
slowly
and
noiselessly
descending
from
the
ceiling
toward
her
one
little
boy
when
he
had
finally
overcome
fear
said
to
his
father
that
he
thought
the
dark
to
be
a
large
live
thing
the
color
of
black
a
girl
of
nineteen
said
she
remembered
that
on
going
to
bed
she
used
to
see
little
black
figures
jumping
about
between
the
ceiling
and
the
bed
it
is
well
known
that
the
feeling
of
fear
is
often
very
intense
among
children
and
where
it
is
due
to
ignorance
it
is
not
right
to
laugh
it
away
doing
so
affords
no
explanation
the
ridicule
may
cause
the
child
to
his
fear
but
will
not
drive
the
feeling
away
since
the
feeling
of
fear
is
so
closely
connected
with
the
strange
and
unknown
the
only
way
that
it
may
be
directly
overcome
is
by
making
the
child
familiar
with
the
objects
that
cause
such
feelings
in
the
case
of
young
children
with
whom
we
can
not
reason
it
is
best
wherever
possible
to
remove
the
cause
or
gradually
to
make
the
child
familiar
with
the
darkness
or
whatever
it
is
that
makes
him
unhappy
one
very
young
child
became
frightened
when
he
was
presented
with
a
teddy
bear
every
time
the
teddy
bear
was
produced
he
would
cry
with
terror
the
mother
was
perplexed
about
what
to
do
now
as
the
teddy
bear
is
not
a
necessary
part
of
the
surroundings
there
is
no
reason
why
it
can
not
be
removed
altogether
and
produced
again
upon
some
future
occasion
when
the
child
is
old
enough
to
be
indifferent
to
it
very
many
children
are
frightened
by
the
touch
of
fur
or
even
of
velvet
but
this
lasts
only
a
short
time
and
they
soon
learn
to
like
dogs
and
cats
the
fear
of
darkness
is
different
we
can
not
eliminate
darkness
from
the
child
experience
and
we
must
patiently
try
to
help
the
child
to
overcome
his
fear
since
he
will
suffer
greatly
so
long
as
it
lasts
the
help
you
give
him
will
also
constitute
one
more
bond
of
sympathy
between
you
and
your
child
and
we
can
not
have
too
many
such
bonds
one
mother
got
her
boy
used
to
going
into
a
dark
room
by
placing
some
candy
on
the
farther
window
and
sending
him
for
that
here
the
child
fixed
his
attention
on
the
goal
and
had
no
time
to
think
of
the
terrors
of
the
dark
after
making
such
visits
a
few
times
the
boy
became
quite
indifferent
to
the
darkness
another
ingenious
mother
gave
her
little
daughter
who
was
afraid
a
tiny
flat
electric
spotlight
which
just
fitted
into
the
pocket
of
her
pajama
jacket
she
took
it
to
bed
with
her
slipped
it
under
the
pillow
and
derived
such
comfort
from
it
that
the
whole
family
was
relieved
the
child
soon
outgrew
her
timidity
a
child
who
from
infancy
has
been
accustomed
to
going
to
sleep
in
the
dark
and
suddenly
develops
a
fear
of
it
ought
to
be
indulged
to
the
extent
of
having
a
light
for
a
few
minutes
to
show
him
that
there
is
nothing
there
to
be
afraid
of
it
may
take
a
few
evenings
and
several
disagreeable
trips
to
the
child
bedroom
but
in
the
end
he
will
be
victorious
and
you
will
have
helped
him
to
win
the
victory
a
child
that
is
not
in
good
health
is
likely
to
be
possessed
by
his
fears
much
longer
than
one
who
is
well
in
the
latter
case
there
is
a
fund
of
energy
to
go
exploring
and
the
child
thus
becomes
more
readily
acquainted
with
his
surroundings
and
as
his
knowledge
grows
his
fears
vanish
again
the
sickly
child
has
not
the
energy
to
fight
his
fears
as
has
the
healthy
child
indeed
the
high
spirits
of
the
healthy
child
often
lead
him
to
seek
the
frightful
just
for
the
exhilaration
he
gets
from
the
sensation
the
period
of
most
intense
fears
is
between
the
ages
of
five
and
seven
and
while
imaginative
children
naturally
suffer
most
they
are
also
the
ones
that
can
call
up
bright
fancies
to
cheer
them
robert
louis
stevenson
must
have
had
a
lovely
time
in
the
dark
seeing
circuses
and
things
as
he
tells
us
in
his
poem
which
begins
all
night
long
and
every
night
when
my
mamma
puts
out
the
light
i
see
the
circus
passing
by
as
plain
as
day
before
my
eye
etc
although
fear
is
a
human
instinct
it
is
not
universal
and
once
in
a
while
we
find
a
child
who
has
no
instinctive
fear
if
such
a
child
is
not
frightened
he
may
remain
quite
ignorant
of
the
feeling
for
many
years
i
know
a
boy
who
at
the
age
of
five
was
unacquainted
with
the
sensation
of
fear
and
never
having
been
frightened
also
did
not
know
the
meaning
of
the
word
fear
he
had
heard
it
used
by
other
children
and
knew
that
it
was
something
unpleasant
but
when
one
day
at
dinner
he
said
to
his
mother
you
know
i
think
i
am
afraid
of
spinach
meaning
that
he
did
not
like
it
it
was
evident
that
the
feeling
of
fear
was
quite
foreign
to
him
many
parents
have
a
feeling
of
helplessness
in
the
face
of
a
trait
that
is
said
to
be
instinctive
as
though
there
were
some
fatal
finality
in
that
classification
but
while
it
is
true
that
fear
is
instinctive
it
is
equally
true
that
it
can
often
be
successfully
fought
by
having
recourse
to
other
instinctive
traits
thus
the
instinct
of
curiosity
which
is
more
widespread
even
than
the
instinct
of
fear
may
be
used
to
counteract
the
latter
since
fear
rests
so
largely
on
ignorance
curiosity
is
its
enemy
because
it
dissipates
ignorance
a
little
boy
who
had
a
certain
fear
of
the
figures
in
the
mirror
that
were
so
vivid
and
yet
so
unreal
used
to
try
to
come
into
a
room
in
which
there
was
a
large
mirror
and
steal
upon
the
causes
of
his
curiosity
unawares
his
double
was
always
there
as
soon
as
he
and
caught
his
eye
but
the
child
lost
his
fear
only
after
he
became
familiar
with
the
characters
in
the
in
the
same
way
curiosity
will
often
compel
the
child
to
become
gradually
so
well
acquainted
with
the
source
of
his
fears
as
to
drive
the
latter
quite
out
of
his
experience
we
must
be
careful
to
avoid
confusing
fear
and
caution
fear
arises
from
ignorance
and
is
not
necessarily
related
to
any
real
danger
caution
on
the
other
hand
is
a
direct
outcome
of
the
knowledge
of
danger
two
little
boys
were
watching
a
young
man
shooting
off
whenever
a
bunch
was
lit
the
older
boy
stepped
away
while
the
younger
one
held
his
ground
someone
taunted
the
older
boy
saying
you
see
harry
is
not
afraid
and
you
are
to
which
he
very
sensibly
replied
i
ai
afraid
neither
but
harry
does
know
that
he
might
get
hurt
and
i
do
therefore
while
we
do
not
wish
our
children
to
be
cowards
neither
do
we
want
them
to
feel
reckless
caution
and
courage
may
well
go
together
in
the
child
character
constantly
warning
the
child
against
possible
danger
does
not
develop
caution
it
is
more
likely
to
destroy
all
spontaneous
action
too
many
mothers
are
always
saying
to
their
children
do
do
this
you
might
hurt
yourself
or
do
go
to
the
stable
the
horse
may
kick
you
and
so
on
if
a
child
is
properly
taught
he
will
get
along
with
the
ordinary
knowledge
concerning
the
behavior
of
things
and
animals
that
might
be
injurious
and
he
will
learn
to
be
careful
with
regard
to
these
without
being
constantly
admonished
and
frightened
the
fear
of
being
considered
afraid
has
its
evil
side
as
well
as
its
good
side
while
it
may
often
make
the
child
affect
the
virtue
when
he
has
it
not
it
does
on
the
other
hand
make
many
a
boy
and
girl
especially
in
the
early
teens
concede
to
the
demands
of
prevailing
fashions
in
misconduct
when
the
conscience
and
the
knowledge
of
right
and
wrong
dictate
a
different
course
the
taunt
you
dassent
is
stronger
than
the
still
small
voice
saying
must
and
so
harry
plays
truant
for
the
first
time
not
so
much
because
he
is
tired
of
school
or
because
the
smell
of
the
young
spring
allures
him
as
because
tommy
dares
him
to
go
swimming
on
the
risk
of
getting
caught
and
licked
harry
yields
for
fear
of
being
called
a
cowardy
custard
it
is
important
to
guard
against
the
moral
effect
of
fear
when
it
is
directed
against
the
judgments
of
others
by
always
referring
the
child
to
what
others
will
think
of
him
we
are
likely
to
make
moral
cowards
a
child
can
be
taught
to
refer
to
his
own
conscience
and
to
his
own
judgment
and
if
he
has
been
wisely
trained
his
conscience
and
judgment
will
be
at
least
as
effective
guides
in
his
relations
with
human
beings
as
his
attempt
to
avoid
misconduct
for
fear
of
what
others
will
think
or
say
the
use
of
fear
as
a
means
of
discipline
is
being
discarded
by
all
thoughtful
parents
and
teachers
we
have
learned
that
authority
maintained
by
fear
is
very
when
a
child
gets
past
a
certain
age
the
obedience
based
upon
fear
of
authority
is
almost
certain
to
turn
into
defiance
the
fear
of
punishment
leads
directly
to
untruthfulness
and
deception
parents
who
rely
upon
affection
and
to
assure
the
right
conduct
of
their
children
get
better
results
than
those
who
terrorize
them
fear
and
hatred
are
closely
connected
and
in
cultivating
fear
we
are
fostering
a
trait
that
may
in
a
critical
moment
turn
to
hatred
the
only
things
that
we
should
teach
our
children
to
fear
are
those
we
should
be
willing
to
have
them
hate
let
your
children
learn
to
fear
and
hate
all
mean
and
selfish
acts
all
cunning
and
deception
all
unfairness
and
injustice
but
even
better
than
teaching
them
to
hate
these
vices
teach
them
to
love
and
admire
and
to
aspire
to
realize
the
positive
virtues
when
we
observe
the
undesirable
physical
effects
of
fear
such
as
the
effect
upon
the
heart
and
the
effect
upon
the
nerve
currents
we
can
hardly
expect
it
to
have
a
beneficial
effect
upon
the
mental
or
moral
side
of
the
child
nature
fear
always
cramps
and
paralyzes
it
never
broadens
or
stimulates
all
the
progress
made
by
our
race
has
been
accomplished
by
those
who
were
afraid
the
men
and
women
of
broad
vision
and
independent
fearless
action
every
mother
has
lurking
in
some
corner
of
her
heart
the
fond
hope
that
her
children
will
in
some
way
contribute
to
the
advancement
of
humanity
to
make
our
life
here
better
worth
living
to
contribute
in
this
way
our
children
must
be
without
fear
vi
the
first
great
law
when
you
have
had
a
scene
with
your
disobedient
robert
you
are
apt
to
wonder
how
jones
ever
manages
to
make
her
children
obey
so
nicely
if
all
secrets
were
made
public
you
would
know
that
jones
has
often
wished
that
she
could
make
her
children
mind
as
nicely
as
do
yours
for
we
always
imagine
that
making
children
mind
is
the
one
thing
that
other
mothers
succeed
in
better
than
we
do
why
is
it
that
we
consider
obedience
of
such
great
importance
in
the
bringing
up
of
our
children
is
it
because
obedience
itself
is
a
supreme
virtue
which
we
desire
to
cultivate
in
our
children
or
is
it
because
we
find
it
convenient
to
receive
obedience
from
those
with
whom
we
have
to
deal
that
obedience
is
a
virtue
can
not
be
denied
but
it
is
a
virtue
only
under
special
kinds
of
human
relationship
the
obedience
required
of
a
fireman
or
a
sailor
is
of
the
same
kind
as
that
which
we
demand
of
a
child
exposed
to
a
danger
that
he
does
not
see
the
work
of
the
fireman
and
of
the
sailor
is
such
that
these
people
must
be
constantly
prepared
to
obey
instantly
the
orders
given
by
those
in
authority
over
them
the
life
of
the
child
however
is
such
as
to
make
his
work
or
his
safety
depend
upon
his
obedience
only
under
exceptional
circumstances
to
justify
our
demand
for
obedience
we
must
find
better
reasons
than
the
stock
argument
so
often
given
namely
that
in
certain
emergencies
the
instant
response
to
a
command
may
result
in
saving
the
child
from
injury
or
even
from
death
the
need
for
obedience
lies
closer
to
hand
than
an
occasional
emergency
which
may
never
arise
in
all
human
relationships
there
come
occasions
for
the
exercise
of
authority
there
is
no
doubt
that
in
the
relations
between
parents
and
child
the
parent
or
elder
person
should
be
the
one
in
authority
on
account
of
his
greater
experience
and
maturer
judgment
quite
apart
from
any
question
of
sentiment
or
tradition
but
if
you
wish
to
exercise
authority
you
must
make
sure
to
deserve
it
laws
and
customs
give
parents
certain
authority
over
their
children
but
well
we
know
that
too
few
of
them
are
able
to
make
wise
use
of
this
authority
not
only
from
the
side
of
our
own
convenience
but
also
from
the
side
of
the
child
real
needs
we
must
give
the
young
spirit
training
in
obedience
the
child
that
does
not
get
the
constant
support
of
a
reliable
and
firm
guide
misses
this
support
the
child
is
happier
when
he
is
aware
of
having
an
unfailing
counsellor
one
who
will
decide
aright
what
he
is
to
do
and
what
he
is
not
to
do
but
when
i
say
that
the
obedient
child
is
happier
than
the
disobedient
one
i
do
not
mean
merely
that
the
latter
gets
into
mischief
more
frequently
or
that
the
former
receives
more
marks
of
affection
from
the
parents
there
is
involved
something
more
important
than
rewards
and
punishments
the
young
child
would
really
rather
obey
than
be
left
to
his
own
decisions
when
he
has
no
one
to
tell
him
what
to
do
or
to
warn
him
against
what
he
must
not
do
the
child
feels
his
helplessness
and
there
is
valuable
tonic
for
the
child
body
as
well
as
for
his
will
in
the
comfortable
consciousness
of
a
superior
authority
upon
which
he
can
safely
lean
as
the
child
becomes
older
he
begins
to
assert
his
own
desires
in
a
more
positive
fashion
and
at
about
two
and
a
half
to
three
years
the
problem
of
obedience
takes
on
a
new
aspect
for
now
the
child
has
had
experience
enough
to
enable
him
to
have
his
own
purposes
and
these
often
come
in
conflict
with
the
wishes
of
the
mother
should
obedience
be
now
demanded
and
should
it
be
insisted
upon
there
is
more
involved
in
this
problem
than
the
convenience
of
administering
the
household
or
the
immediate
safety
and
of
the
child
there
is
involved
the
whole
question
of
the
future
attitude
toward
life
shall
the
child
become
one
who
habitually
obeys
the
commands
of
others
without
questioning
without
resisting
and
so
perhaps
become
a
pliant
tool
in
the
hands
of
powerful
but
unscrupulous
men
or
shall
he
be
allowed
to
go
his
own
way
and
the
wishes
of
others
to
become
perhaps
a
wilful
victim
of
his
own
whims
and
moods
presenting
a
stubborn
resistance
to
overwhelming
forces
that
will
in
the
end
crush
him
in
the
case
of
the
very
young
child
absolute
obedience
must
be
required
for
the
reason
that
the
child
is
not
in
a
position
to
assume
the
responsibility
for
his
conduct
the
will
of
the
mother
must
be
followed
for
the
child
own
safety
and
health
for
the
child
has
no
intelligence
or
experience
that
is
judgment
or
purpose
to
guide
him
he
has
only
blind
impulses
that
may
often
be
harmless
but
are
never
reliable
so
the
first
need
is
for
training
in
regularity
and
this
is
possible
only
under
the
guidance
of
the
mother
or
nurse
who
what
is
to
be
done
or
not
done
and
whose
authority
must
be
absolute
so
the
child
must
first
of
all
learn
to
obey
later
he
must
learn
what
and
whom
to
obey
recognizing
then
in
full
the
value
of
obedience
we
must
be
careful
not
to
exaggerate
it
and
consider
it
a
cardinal
virtue
obedience
is
far
from
being
a
fundamental
virtue
on
the
contrary
once
established
as
a
ruling
principle
in
the
household
or
anywhere
else
it
is
easily
carried
far
enough
to
become
a
source
of
positive
harm
to
obey
means
to
act
in
accordance
with
another
wishes
to
act
in
this
manner
does
not
call
upon
the
exercise
of
judgment
or
responsibility
and
too
many
grow
up
without
acquiring
the
habit
of
using
judgment
and
without
acquiring
a
sense
of
responsibility
they
are
only
too
willing
to
leave
choice
and
decision
to
others
decision
of
character
and
habitual
obedience
do
not
go
well
together
moreover
it
is
now
coming
to
be
more
fully
recognized
that
the
progress
of
society
depends
not
upon
closer
obedience
to
the
few
natural
leaders
but
upon
the
exercise
of
discretion
and
judgment
on
the
part
of
an
ever
larger
number
of
those
who
are
not
leaders
there
may
be
a
still
greater
danger
in
requiring
implicit
obedience
of
every
child
we
have
learned
from
modern
studies
of
the
human
mind
that
is
the
outcome
of
and
when
we
constantly
force
children
to
do
things
that
have
no
direct
connection
with
their
thoughts
and
feelings
or
when
we
prevent
actions
which
follow
naturally
from
their
thoughts
and
feelings
we
are
interfering
with
the
orderly
working
of
the
mind
we
force
children
to
act
in
ways
unrelated
to
their
thoughts
and
feelings
and
as
a
result
we
have
many
men
and
women
of
fine
sentiment
and
lofty
thought
who
never
let
their
ideas
and
sentiments
find
expression
in
effective
action
in
other
words
the
effect
upon
the
mind
of
thoughtless
minding
is
not
a
healthy
one
a
large
amount
of
disobedience
arises
from
the
fact
that
the
attention
and
interest
are
so
different
from
an
adult
the
little
girl
who
is
said
to
have
given
her
name
as
mary
do
illustrates
this
mary
does
a
great
many
things
in
the
course
of
a
day
impelled
by
curiosity
and
the
instinct
to
handle
things
most
of
her
activities
are
harmless
but
when
she
touches
something
that
you
care
about
you
command
her
to
let
it
alone
this
is
quite
proper
very
often
however
she
is
told
to
stop
doing
things
that
are
quite
indifferent
and
that
satisfy
her
natural
craving
for
activity
without
being
in
the
least
harmful
being
interfered
with
constantly
she
soon
comes
to
consider
all
orders
arbitrary
and
disobedience
results
the
other
side
of
the
problem
is
seen
when
a
child
is
told
to
do
something
when
he
is
preoccupied
with
his
own
affairs
you
may
tell
him
a
second
time
very
likely
you
raise
your
voice
the
third
time
you
fairly
shout
this
is
undignified
and
it
is
also
unnecessary
for
bobby
has
the
order
from
the
first
but
he
has
not
to
your
wishes
in
such
cases
there
is
no
primary
disobedience
but
a
frequent
repetition
of
such
incidents
can
easily
lead
bobby
to
become
quite
indifferent
to
your
orders
then
disobedience
is
habitual
the
child
that
has
acquired
the
habit
of
ignoring
the
mother
wishes
will
not
suddenly
begin
to
obey
orders
when
the
emergency
comes
from
these
two
cases
we
may
see
that
it
is
important
to
get
first
the
child
habit
of
attending
to
what
is
said
to
him
by
making
everything
that
is
said
to
him
in
the
second
place
the
child
must
be
taught
to
feel
that
what
he
is
directed
to
do
is
the
best
thing
to
do
for
getting
the
child
to
obey
we
must
keep
constantly
in
mind
the
idea
that
we
are
working
for
certain
habits
now
a
habit
is
acquired
only
through
constant
repetition
of
a
given
act
or
a
given
kind
of
behavior
the
first
rule
for
the
parent
should
therefore
be
to
be
absolutely
consistent
in
demanding
obedience
from
the
child
if
you
call
to
the
children
in
the
nursery
to
stop
their
racket
because
father
is
taking
a
nap
and
fail
to
insist
upon
the
quietness
because
father
just
whispers
to
you
that
he
is
not
sleeping
you
have
given
the
children
practice
in
if
they
are
to
be
allowed
to
go
on
with
the
noise
this
should
be
because
you
openly
permit
them
to
go
on
with
their
noisy
fun
and
not
because
they
may
heedlessly
disregard
your
wishes
direct
disobedience
is
not
to
be
overlooked
under
any
circumstances
it
is
true
that
parents
often
give
orders
that
had
better
not
be
carried
out
but
the
remedy
is
not
in
allowing
the
children
to
disobey
but
in
thinking
twice
or
thrice
before
giving
a
command
or
in
agreeing
with
them
upon
a
course
of
action
without
giving
commands
at
all
by
giving
no
orders
that
are
unnecessary
or
that
are
arbitrary
the
child
will
come
in
time
to
feel
that
your
interferences
with
his
own
impulses
are
intended
for
his
own
good
illustration
only
a
good
reason
can
warrant
calling
an
absorbed
child
from
his
occupation
we
frequently
tell
the
children
that
we
want
them
to
obey
for
their
own
good
if
this
were
true
we
should
have
little
difficulty
in
obtaining
obedience
for
most
children
instinctively
follow
orders
and
suggestions
it
is
only
when
we
abuse
this
instinct
by
too
and
and
commands
for
our
own
convenience
that
the
children
come
to
revolt
at
our
orders
there
are
great
differences
among
children
in
the
readiness
with
which
they
adopt
suggestions
or
follow
orders
some
children
are
easily
dissuaded
from
a
line
of
action
in
which
they
are
engaged
their
attention
is
not
very
closely
filed
and
they
are
easily
distracted
and
may
be
sent
from
one
thing
to
another
without
resenting
the
interruptions
such
children
quickly
learn
to
obey
and
some
seldom
offer
resistance
to
suggestion
but
they
deserve
no
special
praise
or
credit
for
their
perfect
obedience
neither
do
their
parents
deserve
special
credit
for
having
trained
such
children
on
the
other
hand
there
are
children
who
set
their
hearts
very
firmly
upon
the
objects
of
their
desire
and
who
can
not
easily
stop
in
the
middle
of
a
game
or
in
the
middle
of
a
sentence
just
to
put
some
wood
in
the
stove
such
children
will
appear
to
be
disobedient
although
they
are
just
as
affectionate
and
as
loyal
and
as
dutiful
as
the
others
when
you
see
a
child
that
is
a
model
of
obedience
you
can
not
conclude
that
he
has
been
well
trained
nor
is
frequent
disobedience
an
indication
of
neglect
on
the
part
of
the
parents
but
the
majority
of
children
will
fall
in
the
class
of
those
whose
obedience
or
disobedience
is
a
matter
of
habit
resulting
from
the
firmness
and
consistency
and
considerateness
of
the
parents
unless
a
child
has
become
altogether
submissive
he
will
not
obey
all
orders
with
equal
readiness
alice
who
is
not
very
active
does
not
display
any
great
virtue
if
she
sits
still
when
you
tell
her
to
on
the
other
hand
sitting
still
means
to
harry
a
supreme
effort
as
well
as
a
great
sacrifice
to
demand
this
of
him
we
should
have
a
very
good
reason
i
know
children
who
are
models
of
obedience
in
most
matters
but
who
scream
with
protest
and
resentment
when
it
comes
to
taking
medicine
or
even
to
being
examined
by
a
physician
on
the
other
hand
a
little
boy
i
know
to
whom
obedience
in
general
comes
very
hard
has
such
respect
for
the
wisdom
of
physicians
and
for
the
helpfulness
of
medicines
that
he
will
undergo
a
thorough
examination
and
will
swallow
the
bitterest
of
drugs
without
even
making
a
wry
face
if
you
will
look
about
among
your
acquaintances
i
think
you
will
find
that
those
who
get
really
intelligent
obedience
from
their
children
are
the
ones
who
make
the
least
ado
about
it
and
perhaps
never
use
the
phrase
now
you
mind
me
it
is
the
weak
person
who
is
constantly
forced
to
make
appeals
to
his
authority
it
is
the
weak
person
who
is
constantly
threatening
the
child
with
terrible
retributions
for
his
disobedience
yet
none
are
quicker
to
detect
the
weakness
none
know
better
that
the
threats
will
not
be
carried
out
than
those
very
children
whose
obedience
we
desire
thus
to
obtain
many
of
us
get
into
the
habit
of
placing
too
many
of
our
wishes
in
the
form
of
commands
or
orders
to
do
or
not
to
do
instead
of
requesting
as
we
would
of
an
equal
wherever
possible
we
should
suggest
to
the
child
a
line
of
conduct
so
as
to
make
the
child
feel
that
he
is
making
a
choice
you
may
say
to
johnnie
go
and
get
me
a
pail
of
water
or
you
may
say
johnnie
please
get
me
a
pail
of
water
or
you
may
say
johnnie
mother
needs
a
pail
of
water
you
will
perhaps
get
just
as
good
service
in
one
case
as
in
another
but
the
ultimate
effect
on
johnnie
may
make
the
difference
between
a
man
who
finds
work
a
necessary
evil
and
one
who
finds
work
a
means
of
service
from
men
who
have
been
successful
in
managing
industries
and
from
women
who
have
managed
large
households
with
the
least
amount
of
friction
we
can
learn
that
there
is
a
way
of
obtaining
obedience
without
imposing
upon
the
minds
of
those
under
our
authority
whenever
you
wish
to
depart
from
the
usual
routine
there
is
a
good
reason
for
the
change
and
in
most
cases
the
reason
can
be
stated
with
the
request
when
this
is
done
the
order
loses
the
appearance
of
arbitrariness
if
you
say
to
mary
i
wish
you
would
go
out
without
me
this
afternoon
as
i
have
some
important
sewing
to
finish
you
will
most
likely
meet
with
ready
acquiescence
if
however
you
say
you
must
go
alone
this
afternoon
i
ca
go
with
you
and
if
when
mary
dares
ask
why
you
say
because
i
tell
you
to
you
will
certainly
sow
the
seeds
of
rebellion
no
child
will
accept
such
a
reason
if
at
least
you
make
an
appeal
to
your
superior
judgment
and
say
mother
knows
best
there
would
be
something
gained
for
now
you
are
shifting
the
basis
of
the
child
conduct
from
your
position
of
power
over
her
to
the
highest
authority
within
our
reach
namely
good
judgment
the
child
is
thus
learning
to
obey
not
a
but
a
expressing
your
wishes
in
the
form
of
a
request
modified
wherever
possible
by
a
reason
does
not
mean
that
you
are
to
give
the
child
a
reason
for
everything
he
is
asked
to
do
for
if
the
child
has
respect
for
you
and
feels
your
sympathy
with
him
he
will
do
many
things
that
are
requested
without
understanding
any
reason
but
confident
when
he
does
think
of
the
matter
that
you
have
a
good
reason
in
other
words
where
there
have
been
close
sympathy
and
habitual
obedience
the
parent
becomes
in
the
child
mind
the
embodiment
of
those
ideals
or
principles
toward
which
he
feels
loyal
in
the
same
way
men
and
women
who
give
arbitrary
commands
may
get
from
their
assistants
formal
obedience
but
they
never
get
hearty
and
intelligent
cooperation
indeed
it
is
no
doubt
because
we
still
cling
to
the
traditions
of
earlier
times
when
personal
loyalty
and
military
types
of
virtue
were
so
prominent
in
the
minds
of
men
that
we
are
so
slow
to
learn
the
need
for
cooperation
in
modern
times
the
need
is
for
leaders
who
will
inspire
their
fellows
with
enthusiasm
for
cooperation
who
will
wisely
guide
their
fellows
in
effective
service
and
of
the
corresponding
virtues
in
the
followers
obedience
is
the
first
and
yet
we
must
recognize
all
the
time
that
there
are
occasions
when
a
person
must
do
what
he
is
told
to
just
because
he
is
told
and
it
were
well
for
one
who
has
to
take
orders
to
be
able
to
do
so
without
fret
and
bitterness
the
child
should
however
come
sooner
or
later
to
distinguish
between
those
commands
that
arise
out
of
real
necessities
and
those
that
arise
from
the
passion
or
caprice
of
other
persons
to
the
former
he
must
learn
to
submit
with
the
best
possible
grace
with
an
effort
at
understanding
or
even
with
a
desire
to
assimilate
to
himself
to
the
latter
he
should
submit
when
forced
to
only
under
protest
and
with
the
resolve
to
make
himself
free
that
confidence
is
a
strong
factor
in
obtaining
obedience
is
well
illustrated
by
many
boys
in
every
village
and
town
these
boys
are
notoriously
disobedient
at
home
and
at
school
but
on
the
baseball
field
they
will
follow
the
orders
of
the
captain
without
question
they
feet
that
his
commands
are
not
arbitrary
or
thoughtless
that
they
are
not
petty
and
personal
but
really
for
the
greatest
advantage
to
those
concerned
if
we
can
inspire
in
our
children
such
confidence
in
our
motives
we
shall
have
little
worry
about
the
problem
of
obedience
in
the
training
of
the
child
we
often
forget
that
the
child
will
some
time
outgrow
his
childishness
we
must
consider
not
only
what
is
the
best
kind
of
behavior
for
a
but
what
kinds
of
habits
it
is
best
for
a
child
to
develop
in
view
of
his
some
day
becoming
an
adult
human
being
we
want
men
and
women
to
develop
into
free
agents
that
is
people
who
act
in
accordance
with
the
dictates
of
their
own
conscience
and
their
best
judgment
with
this
aim
in
view
how
much
emphasis
should
then
be
placed
on
the
matter
of
obedience
since
the
infant
has
no
will
he
must
be
guided
by
others
for
his
own
safety
and
for
the
development
of
his
judgment
but
we
do
not
wish
him
to
retain
his
habits
of
obedience
to
others
long
enough
to
deprive
him
of
his
independence
of
thought
and
action
the
growing
child
must
learn
to
repress
his
own
many
and
conflicting
impulses
and
to
select
those
that
he
learns
to
be
best
but
if
he
obeys
always
he
can
not
acquire
judgment
and
responsibility
he
learns
through
obedience
to
value
various
kinds
of
authority
and
eventually
to
choose
his
authorities
his
final
authority
being
his
conscience
or
principle
not
impulse
or
whim
he
learns
also
by
questioning
the
principle
of
obedience
to
persons
and
comes
to
guide
his
conduct
by
principle
or
conscience
and
not
by
custom
or
convention
we
do
not
wish
to
train
our
children
for
submission
but
for
judgment
and
discernment
we
must
therefore
respect
the
individuality
we
are
however
not
obliged
to
choose
between
blind
unquestioning
obedience
and
the
undignified
situations
which
arise
from
habitual
disobedience
obedience
to
persons
as
a
settled
habit
is
bad
the
ability
to
obey
promptly
and
intelligently
when
the
commander
authority
is
recognized
to
respond
to
suggestion
and
guidance
is
desirable
obedience
is
a
the
parent
may
use
with
wisdom
and
discretion
it
is
not
an
in
discipline
or
in
life
we
should
educate
obedience
that
is
cultivate
the
habit
of
intelligent
response
but
we
must
not
educate
obedience
that
is
the
habit
of
submitting
to
the
will
of
others
vii
the
training
of
the
will
after
all
what
is
there
about
a
person
that
really
counts
all
experience
and
all
philosophy
agree
that
it
is
the
character
and
the
central
fact
in
character
is
the
yet
the
will
is
not
something
in
the
soul
that
exists
by
itself
as
a
faculty
of
the
mind
the
will
is
a
product
of
all
the
other
processes
that
go
on
in
the
mind
and
can
not
be
trained
by
itself
neither
can
the
will
of
the
child
be
expected
to
come
to
its
own
through
neglect
indeed
although
the
will
can
not
be
trained
by
itself
its
training
is
even
more
important
than
the
training
of
the
intellect
the
great
defect
in
our
moral
training
has
been
that
we
have
generally
attempted
to
train
our
children
too
exclusively
through
precepts
and
mottoes
and
rules
and
too
little
through
activities
that
lead
to
the
formation
of
habits
the
will
depends
upon
the
intellect
but
it
can
not
be
trained
through
alone
though
learning
can
be
made
to
help
there
are
as
we
all
know
only
too
many
learned
men
and
women
with
weak
wills
and
there
are
many
men
and
women
of
strong
character
who
have
had
but
little
book
learning
the
will
expresses
itself
through
action
and
must
be
trained
through
action
but
action
is
impelled
by
feelings
so
the
will
must
be
trained
also
through
the
feelings
all
right
education
is
education
of
the
will
the
will
is
formed
while
the
child
is
learning
to
think
to
feel
and
to
do
we
judge
of
character
by
the
behavior
but
our
behavior
is
not
made
up
entirely
of
acts
of
the
will
hundreds
of
situations
occur
that
do
not
require
individual
decision
but
are
adequately
met
by
acts
arising
from
habit
or
even
from
instinct
the
experience
of
the
race
has
given
us
many
customs
and
manners
which
are
for
the
most
part
satisfactory
and
which
the
child
should
learn
as
a
matter
of
course
it
is
thus
important
that
the
child
should
acquire
certain
habits
as
early
in
life
as
possible
these
habits
will
not
only
result
in
saving
of
energy
but
will
also
give
assurance
that
in
certain
situations
the
child
will
act
in
the
right
way
if
it
is
worth
while
to
have
a
person
knock
on
a
door
before
entering
an
occupied
room
or
if
it
is
worth
while
to
have
people
look
to
the
left
and
to
the
right
before
crossing
a
thoroughfare
the
child
can
acquire
the
habit
of
doing
these
things
always
and
everywhere
without
stopping
to
make
a
decision
on
each
occasion
but
we
must
remember
that
in
guiding
the
child
to
the
formation
of
these
habits
example
and
practice
are
far
more
important
than
precepts
and
rules
example
is
more
important
because
the
child
is
very
imitative
one
rude
act
on
the
part
of
some
older
member
of
the
household
will
counteract
the
benefit
of
many
verbal
lessons
in
politeness
practice
is
important
because
it
is
through
constant
repetition
of
an
act
that
it
at
last
becomes
automatic
and
is
performed
without
thought
or
attention
in
fact
this
is
the
only
way
in
which
a
habit
can
be
formed
having
acquired
habits
about
the
common
relations
of
life
that
do
not
call
for
new
adjustment
every
time
they
are
met
the
mind
is
left
free
to
apply
itself
to
problems
that
really
need
special
consideration
imagine
how
wasteful
it
would
be
if
we
had
to
attend
to
every
movement
in
dressing
ourselves
you
can
easily
see
that
there
are
a
great
many
acts
that
bring
us
in
relation
to
others
and
that
should
be
as
mechanical
and
automatic
as
dressing
and
undressing
it
is
when
we
pass
from
the
routine
acts
which
are
repeated
every
day
that
we
come
to
the
field
in
which
the
will
holds
sway
there
is
nothing
more
helpful
in
the
training
of
the
will
than
the
frequent
performance
of
tasks
requiring
application
self
control
and
the
making
of
decisions
the
routine
of
fixed
duties
in
a
large
and
complex
household
furnished
to
our
grandparents
during
their
youth
just
the
opportunity
for
the
formation
of
habits
in
attending
to
what
needed
to
be
done
without
regard
to
the
momentary
impulse
or
mood
many
of
our
modern
homes
are
so
devoid
of
such
opportunities
that
there
is
great
danger
that
our
children
will
have
altogether
too
much
practice
in
following
their
whims
and
caprices
or
in
doing
nothing
it
is
just
because
the
modern
home
is
so
devoid
of
the
opportunities
for
carrying
on
these
activities
that
provision
must
be
made
in
that
other
great
educational
institution
the
school
all
the
newer
activities
of
the
school
the
shop
work
and
the
school
garden
the
domestic
science
and
the
sewing
the
recreation
centres
the
art
and
the
music
all
these
fads
and
frills
against
which
the
taxpayer
raises
his
voice
in
protest
these
prove
to
be
even
more
important
in
the
making
of
men
and
women
out
of
children
than
the
respectable
and
acceptable
subjects
of
the
school
for
these
activities
are
but
organized
and
planned
substitutes
for
the
incidental
doings
of
the
childhood
of
other
days
they
are
the
formal
substitutes
for
the
activities
by
means
of
which
a
past
generation
of
men
and
women
acquired
that
and
that
insight
into
relations
which
distinguished
their
characters
illustration
habits
of
careful
work
furnish
a
good
foundation
for
the
will
all
systematic
and
sustained
effort
whether
in
organizing
a
game
or
carrying
a
garden
through
from
the
sowing
to
the
harvest
whether
in
making
a
dress
or
a
chest
of
drawers
has
its
moral
value
as
training
in
application
and
decision
quite
distinct
from
its
contribution
to
knowledge
or
skill
two
or
three
generations
ago
no
thought
whatever
was
given
to
the
child
point
of
view
the
authority
of
parents
was
absolute
and
there
were
many
unhappy
childhoods
we
wish
to
avoid
these
errors
and
by
studying
the
child
we
hope
to
adjust
our
treatment
to
his
nature
and
his
needs
but
we
must
be
on
our
guard
against
the
danger
of
going
to
the
extreme
of
attributing
to
the
child
ideas
and
instincts
which
he
does
not
possess
in
former
times
it
was
considered
one
of
the
mother
chief
duties
to
break
the
child
will
realizing
the
importance
of
a
strong
will
we
are
in
danger
of
assuming
that
a
child
stubbornness
or
wilfulness
is
a
manifestation
of
a
strong
will
and
we
hesitate
to
interfere
with
it
this
is
an
entirely
false
assumption
in
the
first
place
a
child
up
to
the
age
of
about
three
years
has
no
will
he
can
only
have
strong
desires
or
impulses
or
pet
aversions
during
this
period
the
mother
will
must
be
his
will
and
there
can
be
no
clash
of
wills
but
to
be
his
will
the
mother
must
guide
the
child
in
accordance
with
needs
instincts
that
is
in
accordance
with
his
nature
and
not
in
accordance
with
her
convenience
or
caprice
she
must
bear
constantly
in
mind
that
the
child
is
not
merely
a
miniature
man
or
woman
but
that
each
stage
in
his
development
represents
a
distinct
combination
of
instincts
impulses
and
capacities
if
for
example
your
little
girl
is
digging
in
the
dirt
a
very
and
healthful
activity
and
you
stop
her
for
no
better
reason
than
that
she
will
soil
her
hands
or
clothes
you
are
unduly
interfering
with
her
and
if
you
continue
in
that
way
you
will
either
make
a
defiant
disagreeable
youngster
or
a
servile
cringing
slave
to
arbitrary
authority
on
the
other
hand
if
johnny
should
wish
to
play
with
a
knife
or
a
box
of
matches
it
manifestly
devolves
upon
you
to
take
these
objects
away
from
him
no
matter
how
strong
his
desire
to
have
them
may
be
but
it
also
devolves
upon
you
to
see
that
such
harmful
objects
are
not
very
easy
for
him
to
obtain
and
to
see
to
it
that
plenty
of
other
harmless
things
are
provided
for
him
this
suggests
a
common
mistake
parents
and
loving
friends
often
make
in
meeting
the
uncomfortable
assertions
of
the
child
will
when
the
child
cries
for
the
moon
you
try
to
get
him
interested
in
a
and
when
he
wants
a
fragile
piece
of
you
try
to
substitute
for
it
a
tin
whistle
with
a
very
young
child
that
is
about
all
you
can
do
but
a
time
comes
when
the
child
is
old
enough
to
know
the
difference
between
that
upon
which
he
has
set
his
heart
and
that
which
you
have
substituted
for
it
in
his
hand
at
this
time
you
must
stop
offering
substitutes
the
child
is
now
old
enough
to
understand
that
some
things
are
to
be
had
and
that
crying
for
them
will
not
bring
them
to
offer
him
a
substitute
is
now
not
only
an
insult
to
his
intelligence
but
it
is
demoralizing
to
his
will
it
makes
for
a
loose
hold
upon
the
object
of
his
desire
and
it
is
the
firmness
of
this
hold
that
is
the
beginning
of
a
strong
will
it
does
not
take
the
child
long
to
learn
that
he
is
not
to
have
a
knife
or
a
lighted
lamp
nor
does
it
take
him
long
to
get
into
the
way
of
scattering
his
desires
so
that
he
has
no
will
at
all
in
the
second
place
the
assumption
that
stubbornness
is
a
sign
of
strength
is
false
even
for
older
children
stubbornness
is
in
fact
a
sign
of
weakness
it
indicates
that
the
child
is
either
incapable
of
adjusting
himself
to
the
appeal
that
is
made
to
his
judgment
or
feelings
or
that
his
weakness
will
make
it
impossible
for
him
in
the
presence
of
his
immediate
desire
to
recognize
the
superior
judgment
and
authority
of
his
elders
at
home
or
in
school
it
takes
much
more
will
power
to
give
in
than
to
carry
one
point
but
we
must
always
make
sure
that
are
not
the
obstinate
and
wilful
ones
if
you
have
a
very
good
reason
for
not
wanting
helen
to
go
to
the
dance
even
if
she
is
too
young
to
understand
that
reason
you
are
perfectly
justified
in
carrying
your
point
if
your
reason
is
a
wise
one
she
will
come
to
see
it
in
time
and
will
honor
and
respect
you
all
the
more
for
not
having
given
in
to
her
impetuous
and
immature
desire
if
she
gives
in
gracefully
because
she
can
understand
the
reasons
or
just
out
of
respect
for
your
wishes
having
found
your
guidance
wise
before
hers
as
well
as
yours
is
the
triumph
the
only
thing
of
which
we
must
make
sure
is
that
we
are
right
to
the
best
of
our
understanding
and
that
we
do
not
insist
upon
having
our
way
just
because
oh
well
just
because
we
have
a
right
to
have
our
way
being
in
authority
as
stanley
hall
the
father
of
child
study
in
this
country
has
so
well
said
our
will
should
be
a
rock
not
a
wave
our
requirements
should
be
uniform
with
no
whim
no
mood
or
periodicity
about
them
having
made
sure
of
ourselves
we
need
not
fear
that
training
our
wilful
children
will
weaken
their
will
we
must
not
neglect
to
consider
the
very
close
relation
that
exists
between
the
health
of
the
body
and
the
health
of
the
spirit
a
strong
will
showing
itself
in
ability
to
concentrate
its
efforts
on
a
chosen
purpose
is
not
to
be
expected
in
a
child
whose
muscles
are
flabby
and
whose
nerves
quickly
tire
since
the
will
expresses
itself
in
action
it
can
be
best
cultivated
in
a
body
capable
of
vigorous
action
the
young
child
is
not
only
a
bundle
of
bones
and
muscles
it
is
also
a
bundle
of
impulses
and
some
of
these
impulses
lead
to
actions
that
are
quite
desirable
while
others
lead
to
actions
that
are
indifferent
and
still
others
to
actions
that
are
decidedly
undesirable
but
so
far
as
the
child
is
concerned
he
has
no
means
of
discriminating
between
one
kind
of
impulse
and
another
he
would
just
as
soon
carry
poison
to
his
mouth
as
good
food
he
would
rather
grasp
at
a
flame
than
at
a
harmless
rattle
one
of
the
essentials
then
becomes
suitable
knowledge
as
the
child
grows
older
he
should
gradually
learn
that
knowledge
is
necessary
to
wise
choice
it
is
not
so
much
the
knowledge
of
what
is
commonly
called
good
or
evil
as
the
knowledge
of
relations
and
needs
that
will
enable
him
to
choose
ends
and
to
choose
effective
means
toward
those
ends
yet
we
can
not
begin
too
early
to
have
such
considerations
as
it
is
right
or
it
is
best
rather
than
i
want
it
influence
the
conduct
of
our
children
but
in
order
to
do
the
right
we
have
to
the
right
and
the
children
who
get
these
moral
lessons
in
their
homes
are
fortunate
indeed
it
is
here
the
child
should
acquire
his
feeling
of
loyalty
to
duty
for
such
lessons
learned
in
the
home
are
the
most
impressive
and
the
most
enduring
we
must
also
make
certain
that
children
all
through
their
lives
at
home
are
given
opportunity
for
choice
and
decision
in
this
matter
of
making
decisions
there
is
a
great
deal
of
individual
variation
and
even
distinct
types
of
persons
have
been
described
according
to
the
way
they
reach
decisions
at
one
extreme
is
the
child
or
the
grown
person
who
apparently
without
any
effort
balances
the
reasons
that
may
be
given
on
the
opposite
sides
of
a
problem
and
makes
his
choice
solely
on
the
strength
of
the
reasoned
argument
herbert
spencer
tells
in
his
autobiography
how
when
a
young
man
he
wrote
down
as
in
a
ledger
all
the
advantages
and
all
the
disadvantages
he
could
think
of
in
regard
to
the
married
state
after
checking
off
the
items
on
the
two
sides
of
the
account
he
found
a
balance
in
favor
of
remaining
single
later
in
life
he
had
his
doubts
as
to
whether
the
decision
was
a
wise
one
but
it
was
the
best
he
could
make
under
the
circumstances
for
he
made
use
of
all
the
knowledge
at
his
command
and
stood
by
his
reasoned
decision
at
the
opposite
extreme
is
the
person
who
resolves
to
do
what
is
right
although
he
may
have
no
systematic
means
of
discovering
what
is
right
and
carries
out
his
resolution
at
the
cost
of
frequently
painful
effort
to
such
persons
there
is
a
kind
of
association
between
what
is
easy
and
what
is
wrong
on
the
one
hand
and
between
what
is
difficult
and
what
is
right
on
the
other
our
early
puritans
were
men
of
this
type
and
there
is
much
to
admire
in
the
sturdiness
with
which
they
crushed
their
impulses
in
the
resolve
to
carry
out
their
ideals
of
the
right
almost
complete
lack
of
will
is
shown
by
those
who
reach
their
decisions
by
not
reaching
them
that
is
there
are
those
doubting
hesitating
souls
who
postpone
making
a
decision
until
action
is
forced
upon
them
by
some
accidental
event
these
let
other
persons
or
the
course
of
events
make
their
decisions
for
them
there
is
such
a
delicate
balancing
of
the
desires
usually
because
all
desires
are
equally
weak
that
none
stands
out
to
dominate
the
choice
of
a
line
of
action
george
wanted
to
go
to
the
circus
and
had
saved
enough
from
his
weekly
allowance
but
he
was
saving
up
to
buy
a
rifle
and
he
was
undecided
now
as
to
whether
he
would
go
to
the
circus
or
add
to
his
savings
and
get
the
rifle
so
much
the
sooner
the
sight
of
some
other
boys
on
the
way
to
the
circus
made
the
decision
for
him
this
decision
was
not
a
reasoned
one
but
an
accidental
one
similar
in
its
weakness
is
the
will
that
reaches
no
decisions
except
as
the
balance
is
upset
by
later
impulses
from
within
the
girl
or
boy
who
allows
a
slight
headache
or
a
tired
feeling
to
make
important
decisions
can
not
be
said
to
have
much
strength
of
character
on
saturday
mabel
was
to
have
gone
on
a
steamboat
excursion
or
on
a
visit
to
a
friend
to
stay
over
night
when
she
went
to
sleep
friday
night
she
had
not
yet
made
up
her
mind
but
she
finally
went
to
visit
her
friend
because
she
had
and
was
too
late
to
join
the
excursion
party
children
that
have
not
acquired
habits
of
making
definite
decisions
will
find
themselves
badly
adrift
when
they
reach
the
adolescent
period
with
its
rapid
changes
of
mood
and
the
masses
of
frequently
conflicting
impulses
to
be
able
to
restrain
each
impulse
to
action
as
it
arises
and
to
hold
it
in
abeyance
until
all
the
alternatives
have
been
canvassed
is
a
power
that
comes
only
after
years
of
thought
and
practice
however
it
is
not
enough
to
be
able
to
refrain
from
doing
what
one
is
impelled
to
do
many
mothers
think
that
they
are
training
the
child
will
when
they
prohibit
the
taking
or
handling
of
various
things
about
the
house
it
is
true
that
the
child
should
learn
when
quite
young
to
avoid
certain
objects
but
if
the
prohibitions
are
too
general
the
child
will
be
frequently
tempted
to
break
the
rules
and
then
he
will
fall
in
his
own
esteem
or
he
will
observe
the
rule
and
have
too
little
outlet
for
his
activity
and
initiative
the
will
does
not
thrive
on
what
the
child
is
from
doing
but
on
what
the
child
does
the
child
need
is
for
practice
in
doing
and
in
choosing
what
he
will
do
when
activities
or
games
are
suggested
to
a
younger
child
it
is
best
to
give
him
a
choice
of
two
or
three
when
the
children
are
older
they
can
be
consulted
about
the
purchase
of
their
clothes
and
they
ought
gradually
to
assume
their
share
a
small
one
at
first
of
the
responsibility
of
the
household
as
early
as
possible
they
should
have
their
own
money
to
spend
as
in
no
other
way
can
they
learn
the
use
of
judgment
and
decision
in
the
spending
of
money
in
the
households
wherein
children
do
not
have
such
opportunities
but
in
which
the
parents
rule
everything
with
a
high
hand
the
children
grow
up
very
inefficient
in
managing
their
time
and
their
money
they
have
become
accustomed
to
being
ruled
and
flounder
helplessly
when
called
upon
to
decide
for
themselves
the
will
which
is
at
the
heart
of
moral
conduct
and
which
is
so
much
in
need
of
training
can
not
as
we
have
seen
be
trained
as
a
thing
by
itself
all
training
and
all
education
must
contribute
to
the
training
of
the
will
still
there
are
some
definite
points
that
we
can
profitably
keep
in
mind
when
we
are
concerned
with
the
child
will
first
of
all
comes
sound
bodily
health
then
there
must
be
sound
habits
for
most
of
the
everyday
activities
that
the
will
may
not
be
dissipated
upon
trivial
matters
and
that
the
common
duties
and
virtues
may
be
assured
there
must
be
constant
practice
in
sustained
effort
and
concentration
upon
useful
tasks
in
order
to
fix
the
habit
of
holding
the
attention
upon
the
chosen
purpose
we
must
not
confuse
wilfulness
with
strength
of
will
and
finally
there
must
be
constant
opportunity
for
making
decisions
that
the
child
may
feel
responsibility
in
making
of
decisions
as
the
highest
type
of
conduct
viii
how
children
reason
those
children
will
not
listen
to
reason
said
a
friend
whom
i
discovered
in
an
agitated
state
of
mind
one
afternoon
when
i
came
to
make
a
call
and
she
was
by
no
means
the
first
to
make
this
observation
indeed
it
is
one
of
the
characteristics
of
children
that
they
will
not
listen
to
reason
that
is
reason
which
is
not
however
saying
anything
against
the
children
good
sense
for
people
with
much
more
experience
have
refused
to
listen
to
reason
the
children
reason
margaret
told
me
her
troubles
her
sister
had
rented
a
farm
near
the
city
for
the
summer
and
had
offered
to
let
walter
spend
his
vacation
with
her
in
exchange
for
such
bits
of
help
as
he
was
able
to
render
but
walter
had
made
up
his
mind
to
go
to
work
in
an
office
that
summer
and
although
he
loved
the
country
and
had
always
wanted
to
drive
a
horse
and
go
fishing
his
mother
attempts
to
convince
him
of
the
wisdom
of
her
choice
were
without
avail
he
would
not
listen
to
her
reasons
she
pointed
to
the
health
argument
to
the
opportunities
for
play
the
free
time
the
driving
the
fishing
and
the
fruit
without
limit
knowing
walter
as
i
did
i
could
not
understand
why
it
was
so
hard
to
convince
him
but
every
story
has
at
least
two
sides
to
it
and
of
this
story
i
had
heard
only
one
the
mother
was
so
concerned
with
giving
her
son
her
good
reasons
for
going
to
the
country
that
she
never
even
thought
of
finding
out
his
equally
good
reasons
for
going
to
the
office
presently
however
walter
came
in
and
my
first
leading
question
brought
out
the
true
secret
of
the
disagreement
what
is
there
about
working
in
an
office
i
asked
the
boy
that
you
care
so
much
about
oh
it
is
working
in
an
office
that
i
care
about
i
just
want
to
earn
some
money
i
never
did
make
any
money
myself
and
now
i
have
a
good
chance
and
mother
wo
let
me
this
was
really
too
simple
here
two
sane
persons
had
spent
several
days
on
the
problem
without
coming
to
any
solution
by
placing
walter
services
on
the
farm
on
a
financial
basis
and
making
him
pay
for
his
board
he
managed
to
spend
his
vacation
healthfully
and
happily
and
profitably
in
every
sense
and
everybody
was
satisfied
over
and
over
again
we
are
impressed
with
the
fact
that
most
disagreements
between
people
whether
between
adults
or
between
children
or
between
children
and
adults
are
due
to
misunderstandings
as
soon
as
parents
resolve
not
to
treat
their
children
arbitrarily
that
is
on
the
basis
of
their
superior
strength
and
authority
they
adopt
a
plan
of
reasoning
with
them
this
plan
might
work
very
well
if
the
parents
only
understood
the
children
way
of
reasoning
if
they
but
realized
that
the
child
does
not
reason
as
do
adults
that
he
reasons
differently
in
each
stage
of
his
development
our
manner
of
reasoning
depends
very
closely
upon
our
language
but
every
significant
word
that
we
use
has
a
distinct
meaning
in
the
mind
of
the
individual
depending
altogether
upon
his
experience
as
the
experience
of
the
child
is
very
meagre
compared
to
that
of
the
person
it
is
no
wonder
that
our
everyday
remarks
are
constant
sources
of
misunderstanding
to
children
the
little
girl
who
had
been
frequently
reproved
for
not
using
her
hand
came
to
have
a
positive
dislike
for
her
other
hand
which
she
naturally
understood
to
be
hand
and
she
did
not
wish
to
have
anything
wrong
about
her
person
a
boy
was
trying
to
tell
his
sister
the
meaning
of
homesick
you
know
how
it
feels
to
be
seasick
do
you
well
it
the
same
way
only
it
at
home
children
are
apt
to
attach
to
a
word
the
first
meaning
that
they
learn
in
connection
with
it
only
with
the
increase
of
experience
can
a
word
come
to
have
more
than
one
meaning
moreover
the
child
will
apply
what
he
hears
with
fatal
exactness
and
literalness
two
little
girls
were
at
a
party
and
the
older
one
found
occasion
to
slap
her
sister
hand
the
hostess
reproved
her
for
this
whereupon
the
little
girl
asked
is
she
my
own
sister
the
hostess
had
to
admit
that
she
was
well
i
heard
papa
say
that
he
can
do
what
he
likes
with
his
own
doing
what
we
like
with
our
own
meant
to
the
child
exactly
what
the
words
said
without
those
qualifications
which
we
naturally
put
in
because
of
our
greater
experience
children
learn
with
wonder
that
mother
was
once
a
baby
and
that
father
was
once
a
baby
and
so
on
sully
tells
of
the
little
girl
who
asked
her
mother
when
everybody
was
a
baby
then
who
could
be
the
nurse
if
they
were
all
babies
thus
shows
real
reasoning
power
it
was
not
the
child
fault
that
she
had
no
historical
perspective
and
so
could
not
see
the
babyhoods
of
different
people
in
their
proper
relations
in
time
a
little
boy
who
was
beginning
to
read
deciphered
a
sign
in
a
grocery
store
families
supplied
he
asked
his
mother
whether
they
could
not
get
a
new
baby
there
when
herbert
was
passing
through
the
scissors
stage
he
cut
a
hole
in
his
father
coat
the
father
scolded
him
for
spoiling
his
suit
herbert
calmly
replied
i
did
not
cut
your
suit
i
only
cut
the
coat
he
resented
this
accusation
which
in
his
mind
was
not
merely
an
exaggeration
but
entirely
false
since
a
suit
is
a
suit
and
a
coat
is
a
coat
a
little
girl
while
out
with
her
nurse
and
brother
got
lost
by
separating
herself
from
the
nurse
side
when
she
was
at
last
found
she
was
reprimanded
for
running
away
from
the
nurse
she
felt
that
she
was
being
unjustly
treated
for
she
said
i
did
not
run
away
i
only
away
meaning
she
had
stepped
around
the
corner
to
look
in
a
window
if
she
had
been
scolded
for
getting
out
of
sight
of
the
nurse
she
would
have
felt
justly
reproved
but
accused
of
doing
something
she
never
did
and
never
thought
of
doing
that
is
running
away
she
naturally
resented
this
those
who
have
to
deal
with
children
in
an
intimate
way
can
not
be
too
scrupulous
about
how
they
use
their
words
the
logic
of
children
often
appears
to
us
all
wrong
until
we
take
the
trouble
to
see
how
they
come
to
their
queer
conclusions
the
story
is
told
of
a
boy
who
was
sent
to
the
circus
in
the
neighboring
town
by
his
uncle
who
gave
him
an
additional
quarter
so
you
can
ride
back
in
case
it
rains
well
it
did
rain
and
howard
came
back
riding
on
the
top
seat
next
to
the
driver
wet
to
the
skin
now
any
person
knows
why
he
was
to
ride
back
in
case
it
rains
but
to
howard
the
association
of
ideas
was
directly
between
raining
and
riding
and
not
between
riding
and
coming
home
dry
this
illustrates
a
very
common
difference
between
the
reasoning
of
children
and
that
of
adults
we
ideas
from
a
situation
and
combine
them
and
come
to
conclusions
the
child
combines
ideas
but
he
does
not
make
any
selection
and
the
simple
explanation
for
this
lies
in
the
fact
that
the
child
has
not
enough
experience
to
enable
him
to
select
what
is
significant
thus
a
little
girl
who
had
been
too
boisterous
in
her
play
was
called
in
by
her
mother
and
made
to
sit
quietly
in
a
chair
for
about
ten
minutes
at
the
end
of
this
time
her
mother
asked
her
whether
she
would
be
good
now
the
child
promised
that
she
would
and
was
told
that
she
might
then
go
out
to
play
again
as
she
arose
she
affectionately
turned
to
the
chair
and
said
thank
you
dear
chair
for
making
me
so
good
having
been
declared
good
after
sitting
in
the
chair
she
attributed
the
beneficent
change
in
her
behavior
to
the
chair
and
being
a
polite
little
girl
she
thanked
the
chair
very
often
these
simple
types
of
reasoning
have
their
humorous
aspects
and
we
do
not
take
them
seriously
one
winter
a
little
boy
who
had
always
gone
to
bed
regularly
he
was
four
and
a
half
years
old
then
began
to
call
for
some
one
to
come
to
him
after
he
was
supposed
to
be
asleep
he
wanted
to
sit
up
and
play
he
wanted
to
get
dressed
and
he
wanted
something
more
to
eat
this
continued
for
several
evenings
and
it
seemed
impossible
to
get
him
back
into
his
good
habits
at
last
he
was
asked
do
you
want
to
get
up
now
and
he
answered
at
once
because
it
is
winter
now
yes
it
is
winter
now
but
it
is
time
for
you
to
be
asleep
he
was
told
but
it
says
in
the
book
that
i
must
get
up
he
insisted
which
book
i
will
show
you
and
he
took
from
his
shelf
a
copy
of
garden
of
verses
and
turned
to
the
picture
opposite
the
poem
that
begins
in
winter
i
get
up
at
night
and
dress
by
yellow
candle
light
to
him
this
meant
that
in
winter
after
going
to
bed
one
must
get
up
and
dress
it
is
very
likely
many
children
who
have
had
this
delightful
poem
read
to
them
have
interpreted
it
in
the
same
way
but
probably
very
few
parents
have
taken
the
pains
to
trace
their
children
unaccountable
misbehavior
at
bedtime
to
such
a
source
this
same
poem
produced
in
another
child
quite
a
different
train
of
reasoning
for
why
did
the
little
girl
get
up
at
night
and
sleep
in
the
daytime
he
asked
was
she
a
trained
nurse
it
then
became
necessary
to
recall
that
an
aunt
of
the
child
who
a
trained
nurse
often
slept
at
home
during
the
day
after
having
worked
with
some
patient
at
night
there
is
no
doubt
that
many
of
the
crotchets
and
perversities
of
a
child
have
their
origin
in
chains
of
reasoning
that
are
perfectly
legitimate
in
view
of
the
past
experiences
of
the
young
mind
although
not
in
harmony
with
the
reasoning
of
more
mature
minds
the
parent
spends
much
time
and
energy
and
much
heartburning
sometimes
to
overcome
these
whims
what
is
needed
is
a
patient
and
sympathetic
attempt
to
discover
how
the
child
has
come
to
his
queer
ideas
and
desires
the
annoyance
that
children
cause
us
with
their
questionings
is
due
very
largely
to
the
fact
that
we
can
not
answer
their
questions
since
the
reasoning
that
prompts
them
is
too
searching
a
little
boy
shocked
and
vexed
his
grandmother
who
was
trying
to
teach
him
the
elements
of
theology
by
asking
who
made
god
it
is
very
likely
that
every
normal
child
has
asked
the
same
question
in
one
form
or
another
this
attempt
to
reach
back
to
the
very
beginning
of
causes
resembles
in
many
ways
the
speculations
of
the
mediaeval
metaphysicians
and
should
certainly
not
be
discouraged
we
need
not
on
the
other
hand
make
the
effort
to
answer
every
question
a
child
may
ask
for
at
a
certain
stage
in
his
development
he
will
get
the
habit
of
asking
questions
without
really
caring
for
the
answers
but
the
questions
are
worth
hearing
in
most
cases
just
to
help
us
understand
how
the
child
reason
some
of
the
questions
indicate
a
great
deal
of
reasoning
of
a
very
valuable
kind
when
the
little
boy
asks
why
do
i
see
two
things
with
my
two
eyes
or
when
the
little
girl
looks
up
from
her
dolls
and
asks
am
i
real
or
just
pretend
like
my
doll
they
show
that
they
have
been
thinking
when
a
child
has
passed
through
the
metaphysical
stage
of
reasoning
he
will
be
more
interested
in
animals
and
other
objects
of
nature
and
his
questions
will
have
to
do
more
with
the
operation
of
processes
how
he
grows
and
how
fishes
breathe
in
the
water
and
how
birds
fly
later
he
wants
to
know
how
things
work
what
makes
the
locomotive
go
how
the
noise
goes
through
the
telephone
how
the
incubator
makes
chickens
come
out
of
eggs
the
reasoning
of
the
child
may
lead
to
weird
conclusions
but
it
is
real
reasoning
and
can
be
improved
not
by
being
ridiculed
nor
by
being
suppressed
but
by
being
sympathetically
understood
and
encouraged
perhaps
the
most
serious
phase
of
the
peculiarities
of
reasoning
appears
with
older
children
when
it
comes
to
reasoning
about
right
and
wrong
conduct
professor
swift
of
washington
university
has
made
a
careful
study
of
this
subject
from
replies
given
by
many
men
to
questions
about
their
ideas
as
boys
it
seems
that
men
who
are
irreproachable
in
their
moral
standards
pass
through
a
stage
in
which
they
consider
it
legitimate
fun
to
rob
orchards
or
to
commit
petty
thefts
children
draw
fine
distinctions
between
acts
and
acts
that
are
very
though
they
may
not
be
one
man
says
i
distinguished
between
and
another
says
of
fruit
taking
i
only
partly
regarded
it
as
stealing
one
man
writes
when
a
employer
refused
to
let
me
have
my
clothes
at
cost
i
pocketed
enough
of
his
change
to
bring
my
clothes
down
to
the
cost
mark
few
regarded
taking
money
from
their
parents
as
very
bad
and
distinguished
between
such
stealing
and
taking
money
from
strangers
a
boy
of
fifteen
was
reproved
for
holding
his
ear
to
the
keyhole
of
a
room
in
which
his
mother
and
sisters
were
having
an
animated
discussion
the
appellation
eavesdropper
did
not
disconcert
him
in
the
least
on
the
contrary
he
undertook
to
justify
his
conduct
on
the
ground
that
he
was
being
discussed
and
as
he
had
no
dictagraph
he
was
obliged
to
do
the
listening
in
person
the
fact
that
the
dictagraph
had
been
so
frequently
used
for
getting
information
that
was
later
used
in
court
was
to
him
a
sufficient
justification
of
his
conduct
it
is
well
known
that
all
children
pass
through
the
stage
illustrated
by
these
cases
in
which
they
have
the
conception
of
right
and
wrong
for
most
children
the
difference
between
going
to
the
reformatory
or
jail
and
turning
out
decent
men
and
women
is
one
of
wholesome
and
sympathetic
environment
undue
severity
no
less
than
bad
example
confirms
many
a
youth
in
these
habits
which
should
represent
but
a
passing
stage
in
his
development
adults
should
not
read
their
own
ideas
of
morality
into
the
acts
of
their
children
and
then
catalogue
them
as
right
or
wrong
most
children
acts
are
neither
right
nor
wrong
they
are
merely
expressions
of
feelings
and
ideas
peculiar
to
the
stage
of
development
with
young
children
ideas
of
right
and
wrong
divide
themselves
into
acts
which
are
permitted
and
those
which
are
forbidden
they
have
no
conception
of
right
and
wrong
beyond
that
many
an
act
that
a
boy
commits
which
we
consider
wrong
is
but
the
expression
of
the
instincts
of
his
age
our
duty
consists
in
helping
him
to
pass
through
that
stage
without
making
permanent
habits
of
these
temporary
impulses
this
help
must
not
be
given
through
branding
the
acts
as
wicked
or
criminal
nor
is
moralizing
itself
generally
effective
help
must
come
through
providing
adequate
opportunities
for
play
and
games
and
work
that
will
use
up
surplus
energy
both
of
mind
and
body
above
all
help
must
come
through
the
healthy
examples
and
the
constant
manifestation
of
high
ideals
in
the
home
every
normal
child
will
in
time
respond
to
these
influences
there
are
unfortunately
some
children
that
will
not
develop
beyond
this
stage
of
primitive
savage
instincts
but
such
abnormal
children
are
rare
and
we
can
not
deal
with
them
here
with
the
problem
of
reasoning
then
as
with
all
other
aspects
of
child
training
it
is
a
question
of
understanding
of
being
in
close
relations
with
one
children
and
being
able
to
fathom
the
workings
of
their
minds
ix
work
and
play
all
work
and
no
play
makes
jack
a
dull
boy
and
it
is
this
same
lack
of
play
that
produces
so
many
dull
men
and
women
for
the
spirit
of
play
is
the
spirit
of
youth
and
spontaneity
and
joy
yet
work
and
play
have
so
much
in
common
that
it
seems
unfortunate
indeed
that
all
of
us
have
not
learned
to
retain
our
youth
when
work
becomes
necessary
i
trust
that
there
are
few
who
still
believe
that
play
is
wicked
if
we
desire
our
children
to
grow
up
into
healthy
and
joyful
and
moral
men
and
women
then
must
we
consider
play
a
necessity
of
life
for
play
is
more
than
merely
a
pleasant
means
for
passing
the
time
it
is
a
school
of
life
it
is
a
means
for
physical
mental
and
moral
education
the
young
child
before
he
is
old
enough
to
play
horse
or
to
imitate
other
activities
he
sees
going
on
around
him
gets
his
play
from
handling
a
rattle
or
a
ball
from
random
movements
of
his
legs
and
arms
or
from
playing
with
his
fingers
and
his
toes
he
derives
satisfaction
from
the
sensations
of
touch
and
sight
and
sound
as
well
as
from
the
feeling
of
freedom
and
the
sensation
of
his
active
muscles
but
this
infantile
play
is
not
only
satisfying
to
the
child
it
is
a
means
for
learning
the
use
of
his
little
hands
and
arms
and
legs
when
the
baby
learns
to
crawl
and
later
to
walk
he
derives
pleasure
from
the
exercise
of
his
arts
and
at
the
same
time
attains
perfection
in
the
use
of
his
limbs
and
in
the
correlation
of
his
muscles
he
is
also
gaining
strength
with
his
growth
for
these
muscles
will
not
gain
in
strength
unless
they
are
exercised
of
course
the
child
does
not
know
about
these
advantages
of
play
but
the
mother
should
know
and
give
the
growing
child
every
opportunity
to
exercise
himself
in
every
possible
way
for
thus
alone
can
he
gain
in
strength
in
endurance
and
in
confidence
when
the
child
is
a
little
older
his
play
takes
on
new
forms
for
he
is
now
deliberately
things
the
chairs
become
wagons
and
animals
the
corner
of
the
room
may
be
made
into
a
lake
a
pencil
or
a
is
quite
long
enough
for
a
fishing
pole
and
a
handful
of
beans
may
be
converted
into
all
kinds
of
merchandise
coins
for
barter
a
flock
of
birds
or
seaside
pebbles
that
is
as
the
child
experience
broadens
he
finds
more
to
imitate
he
exercises
his
imagination
more
and
combines
into
more
complex
plays
the
materials
he
finds
about
him
but
all
the
time
the
child
is
as
much
so
as
an
artisan
at
his
task
and
all
the
time
the
child
is
more
rapidly
probably
than
if
he
were
at
school
and
all
the
time
the
child
is
that
is
enjoying
the
outlet
of
his
impulses
illustration
work
is
play
play
has
been
called
the
ideal
type
of
exercise
because
it
is
the
kind
of
exercise
that
occupies
the
whole
child
his
mental
as
well
as
his
physical
side
and
later
also
the
moral
side
in
play
the
exercise
is
regulated
by
the
interests
so
that
while
there
may
be
extreme
exertion
there
is
not
the
same
danger
of
overstrain
as
is
possible
with
work
that
he
is
forced
to
do
in
play
the
exercise
is
carried
on
with
freedom
of
the
spirit
so
that
the
flow
of
blood
and
the
feeling
of
exhilaration
make
for
health
when
children
begin
to
play
at
work
their
activities
are
not
entirely
imitative
although
the
kind
of
work
they
choose
will
be
determined
by
the
kinds
of
activities
that
go
on
about
them
the
child
has
real
interests
in
work
and
these
should
be
encouraged
and
cultivated
the
chief
interest
is
perhaps
the
growing
sense
of
mastery
over
the
materials
which
the
child
uses
he
can
make
blocks
take
on
any
form
he
pleases
although
the
first
houses
he
tries
to
build
are
apt
to
be
just
a
random
piling
of
his
material
there
follows
a
growing
deliberation
and
planning
so
that
he
comes
at
last
to
make
what
he
has
to
make
and
not
merely
produce
an
accidental
result
the
earlier
plays
of
the
child
are
not
at
all
in
the
nature
of
games
there
is
not
at
first
the
need
for
a
companion
there
is
no
special
order
in
which
the
various
acts
of
his
play
have
to
be
carried
out
when
he
plays
horse
on
a
stick
or
is
a
parade
all
by
himself
or
plays
house
in
the
corner
a
few
simple
movements
are
repeated
until
the
child
is
tired
of
them
or
until
something
occurs
to
shift
his
interest
nor
is
there
in
these
early
plays
a
special
point
that
marks
the
end
of
the
interest
in
games
however
these
three
factors
are
always
present
it
takes
two
or
more
to
play
a
game
there
is
a
definite
order
or
succession
of
events
and
there
is
a
definite
finish
or
climax
and
as
we
watch
the
children
at
their
games
we
can
see
their
whole
mental
and
moral
development
unfold
before
us
for
nothing
is
more
characteristic
of
a
stage
of
development
than
the
games
in
which
he
is
interested
while
we
are
content
to
let
the
younger
children
play
as
much
as
they
like
because
very
often
the
more
they
play
the
less
they
annoy
us
we
are
all
inclined
to
expect
of
the
older
children
an
increasing
share
of
work
and
a
declining
interest
in
play
some
of
us
are
even
inclined
to
discourage
the
play
instinct
as
the
children
grow
older
because
we
have
come
to
think
of
play
as
something
not
only
frivolous
and
useless
but
even
a
harmful
waste
of
time
now
the
educational
value
of
play
keeps
pace
with
the
development
of
the
child
that
is
to
say
the
child
outgrows
interest
in
games
about
as
fast
as
these
lose
their
educational
value
the
new
games
that
the
child
takes
up
year
after
year
always
have
something
new
to
teach
him
illustration
let
them
romp
in
winter
as
well
as
in
summer
the
plays
of
the
early
period
develop
his
sense
perceptions
they
give
practice
in
seeing
and
hearing
and
touching
with
quick
discernment
then
for
four
or
five
years
play
gives
increased
mastery
of
the
child
own
body
and
over
the
objects
and
materials
with
which
he
plays
running
and
jumping
are
for
skill
and
for
speed
the
competitive
instincts
drive
each
to
do
the
best
he
can
for
himself
later
the
games
give
exercise
in
the
adjustment
of
the
child
not
only
to
his
material
surroundings
but
also
to
other
children
in
other
words
he
learns
to
take
his
place
among
other
human
beings
from
the
games
in
which
the
children
take
their
turns
at
some
activity
the
timid
child
learns
that
he
has
equal
rights
with
others
and
acquires
whereas
the
child
disposed
to
be
overbearing
learns
the
equally
necessary
lesson
that
others
have
rights
which
he
must
respect
every
child
learns
from
these
games
how
to
be
a
good
loser
as
well
as
how
to
be
a
good
winner
just
those
qualities
that
make
an
adult
an
agreeable
associate
in
business
or
in
social
dealings
are
brought
out
by
these
games
as
they
can
be
by
no
ordinary
form
of
work
which
the
children
have
a
chance
to
do
it
is
only
in
very
recent
times
that
we
have
begun
to
notice
that
the
work
required
of
the
children
in
the
schools
is
of
a
kind
that
either
ignores
the
development
of
the
social
instincts
or
actually
hinders
them
so
that
the
moral
or
social
effect
of
successful
school
work
is
frequently
very
undesirable
when
a
child
is
set
to
do
some
work
by
himself
even
if
the
work
is
not
too
difficult
for
him
there
is
no
exercise
for
the
social
instinct
and
the
work
must
be
very
interesting
indeed
to
hold
his
continued
attention
as
the
child
grows
older
there
is
increasing
need
for
social
stimulation
of
the
cooperative
kind
and
less
of
the
emulative
kind
where
the
experiment
has
been
tried
of
having
the
children
approach
their
school
work
as
they
approach
a
game
with
the
feeling
of
getting
at
an
interesting
goal
with
opportunities
for
each
to
do
his
best
for
the
whole
group
and
to
help
the
others
the
work
becomes
as
interesting
as
a
game
and
acquires
the
same
educational
value
as
a
good
game
well
played
in
the
home
we
might
often
get
the
necessary
work
done
with
more
expedition
and
with
better
spirit
if
we
recognized
the
child
need
of
constant
outlet
for
his
emotions
and
if
we
recognized
the
depressing
effect
of
routine
and
solitude
and
monotony
one
of
the
chief
reasons
why
working
girls
prefer
to
go
to
shops
and
factories
as
against
domestic
service
lies
just
in
this
natural
instinct
for
society
the
work
of
the
household
has
much
more
variety
than
the
work
of
a
factory
but
most
of
it
has
to
be
done
in
solitude
without
the
stimulation
that
comes
from
the
companionship
of
others
doing
the
same
thing
or
at
least
working
within
reach
of
the
voice
illustration
in
their
games
they
should
learn
to
lose
as
well
as
to
win
the
truly
wonderful
transformations
in
character
that
have
been
worked
in
girls
and
in
boys
by
means
of
play
have
taught
us
the
moral
value
of
for
the
older
children
in
these
games
which
come
at
a
period
when
the
child
has
already
acquired
considerable
skill
and
strength
the
chief
interest
is
in
doing
the
best
for
the
team
so
that
the
individual
learns
the
importance
of
subordinating
himself
to
a
common
purpose
he
learns
the
joy
of
contributing
his
best
to
his
side
without
considering
his
individual
glory
or
gains
in
this
way
he
acquires
that
negative
but
very
important
side
of
which
consists
in
the
ability
to
doing
what
the
impulse
would
drive
him
to
he
learns
also
the
importance
of
dreary
drudgery
in
his
practice
work
for
acquiring
special
skill
and
a
boy
will
spend
hours
in
such
dull
practice
animated
by
the
desire
not
to
excel
some
other
individual
but
by
the
desire
to
help
his
team
win
he
learns
not
only
to
take
his
place
in
the
game
but
to
judge
his
companions
by
their
special
ability
and
by
their
value
to
the
group
rather
than
by
clothes
or
personal
feelings
or
other
outward
and
incidental
facts
all
these
things
the
team
game
teaches
as
no
mere
whether
in
school
or
home
can
teach
we
have
learned
from
the
results
of
these
play
activities
with
all
kinds
of
children
in
the
city
and
in
the
country
of
rich
and
of
poor
that
the
spirit
of
the
game
is
not
only
capable
of
stimulating
the
growing
boy
and
girl
to
a
tremendous
amount
of
exertion
but
also
of
organizing
his
or
her
feelings
and
ideals
into
effective
moral
and
social
standards
and
when
the
same
spirit
is
applied
to
work
we
can
get
the
same
valuable
educative
results
with
the
addition
of
a
higher
appreciation
of
work
as
work
than
usually
comes
from
an
early
experience
with
doing
necessary
but
disagreeable
tasks
for
example
in
one
city
the
shop
work
of
classes
of
boys
was
organized
on
a
cooperative
basis
the
boys
worked
in
teams
for
the
making
of
desks
or
cabinets
the
results
as
measured
by
finished
product
or
by
the
quality
of
the
workmanship
were
far
ahead
of
what
the
same
instructors
could
get
from
the
same
boys
when
the
attempt
was
made
to
stimulate
the
workers
by
means
of
prizes
and
individual
rewards
children
can
learn
to
work
together
as
well
as
to
play
together
if
you
have
noticed
that
two
workers
very
often
do
half
as
much
work
in
a
given
time
as
one
worker
it
is
because
they
have
not
learned
to
work
together
they
have
been
denied
the
opportunity
of
learning
this
and
now
take
occasion
when
they
do
get
together
to
do
almost
everything
but
work
there
are
many
opportunities
in
the
ordinary
household
to
teach
girls
and
boys
to
do
useful
work
in
a
spirit
very
similar
to
that
which
they
put
into
their
games
it
may
not
be
possible
to
make
all
the
necessary
work
as
interesting
as
games
but
the
remoter
purpose
of
the
work
whether
it
is
to
accomplish
something
whose
need
is
recognized
by
the
child
or
the
hope
of
some
reward
should
make
for
close
attention
to
the
task
in
hand
for
example
after
a
certain
age
sweeping
and
other
household
tasks
lose
their
play
interest
but
if
the
girl
has
become
skilful
enough
to
do
the
sweeping
without
tiring
her
recognition
of
the
necessity
of
the
work
or
her
thought
of
what
she
wants
to
do
when
the
task
is
accomplished
should
make
it
possible
to
get
through
with
this
work
without
a
feeling
of
hardship
some
educators
approve
of
allotting
definite
tasks
to
the
girls
and
boys
and
compensating
them
in
definite
amounts
this
gives
them
not
only
a
measure
of
the
value
of
their
service
but
makes
them
feel
the
responsibility
of
each
contributing
toward
the
maintenance
of
the
establishment
the
main
thing
is
that
the
children
shall
not
look
upon
work
as
a
cruel
imposition
and
to
this
end
we
should
develop
the
spirit
of
helpfulness
and
cooperation
and
to
transfer
this
spirit
already
developed
in
play
to
the
work
that
has
to
be
accomplished
one
form
of
the
expression
of
the
play
instinct
has
come
lately
to
arouse
a
great
deal
of
public
interest
and
that
is
the
dance
books
have
been
written
about
the
history
of
the
dance
the
esthetics
of
the
dance
the
technique
of
the
dance
the
symbolism
of
the
dance
and
many
other
aspects
what
concerns
the
parent
chiefly
is
to
know
that
the
dance
is
at
once
a
healthful
exercise
an
important
aid
to
social
adjustment
and
a
valuable
for
the
emotions
with
the
rapid
growth
of
our
cities
we
have
come
suddenly
to
realize
that
nearly
half
of
the
nation
children
have
no
in
which
to
play
since
the
open
fields
and
vacant
lots
have
been
invaded
by
warehouses
and
factories
and
tenements
and
so
the
playground
movement
has
gained
rapid
headway
playgrounds
have
been
established
and
placed
in
charge
of
competent
and
enthusiastic
leaders
who
are
teaching
the
children
something
they
never
should
have
unlearned
but
at
the
same
time
we
are
coming
to
realize
that
the
children
in
the
country
and
in
small
towns
although
they
have
plenty
of
space
have
not
really
had
the
opportunity
to
get
the
most
out
of
their
play
activities
it
would
seem
that
even
the
instinct
of
play
can
be
made
to
work
to
better
purpose
when
it
is
intelligently
directed
it
is
our
duty
then
to
provide
not
only
play
space
and
play
time
but
also
play
material
and
where
possible
play
direction
it
is
our
further
duty
to
keep
alive
in
ourselves
as
far
as
possible
the
spirit
of
play
for
there
is
no
one
thing
that
will
do
so
much
to
keep
us
young
and
in
sympathy
with
our
children
as
the
ability
to
play
as
they
play
and
to
play
with
them
excepting
only
the
infant
when
playing
with
his
fingers
and
toes
the
child
must
play
with
some
or
with
some
the
selection
of
suitable
toys
becomes
a
more
serious
problem
than
is
commonly
realized
when
we
once
recognize
the
great
influence
of
play
upon
the
child
stepping
into
the
toy
shop
we
are
confronted
by
a
multitude
of
objects
the
variety
and
quantity
of
which
are
distracting
everything
that
the
ingenuity
of
man
could
devise
is
here
presented
to
our
astonished
eyes
and
children
gaze
upon
the
great
spectacle
and
are
delighted
if
we
go
to
the
store
just
to
be
amused
or
to
buy
a
very
indefinite
something
for
a
child
of
a
certain
age
we
are
quickly
satisfied
but
if
we
have
in
our
mind
some
idea
as
to
what
is
really
good
for
the
child
who
is
to
receive
the
gift
it
is
just
as
hard
to
find
the
right
thing
in
the
immense
toy
store
as
in
the
little
general
store
that
also
keeps
toys
the
manufacture
of
toys
has
grown
to
a
tremendous
industry
but
with
no
ideal
behind
it
no
guiding
educational
principle
toys
are
made
to
sell
having
fulfilled
that
function
the
manufacturer
is
not
further
concerned
consequently
toys
are
made
to
attract
the
eye
durability
use
and
need
from
the
point
of
view
are
rarely
considered
in
selecting
toys
we
must
not
consider
what
would
amuse
or
entertain
its
but
solely
the
child
need
and
this
need
will
differ
at
the
various
stages
in
his
development
illustration
do
forget
how
to
play
with
the
children
for
the
little
child
who
has
no
skill
we
want
to
get
toys
that
exercise
the
large
muscles
he
should
have
blocks
that
are
large
it
is
a
common
mistake
to
suppose
small
toys
are
suitable
for
small
children
within
certain
limits
just
the
opposite
is
true
young
children
can
also
use
toys
that
merely
need
to
be
manipulated
without
having
much
significance
things
that
can
be
taken
apart
and
put
together
are
enjoyed
and
are
very
instructive
a
child
should
get
from
his
toys
a
bare
suggestion
of
the
object
and
not
a
lifelike
representation
that
will
be
of
interest
to
the
critical
adult
refinement
of
finish
and
realistic
representation
are
entirely
wasted
on
the
child
a
massive
wooden
dog
or
bird
is
better
than
a
furry
or
feathery
one
it
is
enough
of
a
dog
or
bird
so
far
as
the
child
is
concerned
and
if
it
can
stand
rough
handling
so
much
the
better
for
the
little
boy
or
girl
an
animal
that
can
stand
up
or
be
drawn
about
by
a
string
is
quite
satisfactory
but
before
the
age
of
three
years
is
reached
the
animal
must
have
movable
parts
so
that
it
may
be
put
into
various
positions
be
made
to
do
things
at
about
three
years
of
age
the
child
also
comes
more
and
more
to
see
things
in
relation
to
each
other
and
no
longer
as
isolated
objects
at
this
time
if
he
has
a
cow
he
wants
also
a
stable
in
which
to
keep
her
the
doll
calls
for
a
carriage
and
bed
and
so
on
this
is
something
to
keep
in
mind
in
planning
our
purchases
children
like
to
reproduce
in
their
plays
the
processes
which
they
see
going
on
around
them
or
about
which
they
hear
this
is
in
a
way
their
preparation
for
the
activities
of
adult
life
if
the
little
boy
or
girl
wants
to
play
farm
or
menagerie
or
laundry
or
grocery
store
it
is
not
necessary
to
buy
the
whole
outfit
at
once
the
child
will
probably
not
be
ready
for
it
and
if
he
gets
more
than
he
can
comfortably
use
he
will
be
overwhelmed
and
many
objects
are
likely
to
be
neglected
let
us
say
for
instance
that
your
little
boy
has
received
a
and
horse
for
his
birthday
and
he
has
exhausted
the
possibilities
of
play
with
them
now
here
is
christmas
and
you
can
give
him
or
make
him
a
nice
substantial
barn
and
someone
else
can
give
him
a
cow
immediately
the
possibilities
for
play
are
greatly
multiplied
he
can
take
the
cow
to
pasture
bring
her
into
the
barn
to
be
milked
take
the
milk
to
market
and
store
away
hay
for
the
winter
and
so
on
indefinitely
in
time
he
can
have
a
barnyard
build
and
with
his
blocks
and
spend
many
happy
and
instructive
hours
a
great
advantage
in
having
toys
grouped
about
some
central
idea
is
that
several
children
can
play
at
the
same
time
and
each
particular
toy
stays
in
use
much
longer
than
it
would
otherwise
i
have
spoken
of
your
little
boy
as
the
manager
of
the
toy
farm
but
in
these
days
when
women
are
entering
every
profession
there
is
no
reason
to
suppose
that
it
is
not
your
little
girl
who
will
need
those
things
still
although
we
know
that
in
spite
of
traditions
little
boys
like
to
play
with
dolls
and
little
girls
like
to
play
with
other
things
we
shall
for
the
sake
of
convenience
stick
to
the
traditions
and
discuss
the
little
girl
in
connection
with
dolls
there
is
nothing
that
will
give
your
little
daughter
greater
pleasure
and
at
the
same
time
be
more
instructive
than
an
opportunity
to
run
a
whole
doll
house
by
this
i
do
not
mean
the
elaborate
constructions
that
are
sold
in
the
large
shops
under
that
name
no
a
packing
case
painted
and
divided
into
four
parts
will
serve
the
purpose
far
better
gradually
the
different
rooms
can
be
furnished
and
in
the
meantime
there
is
plenty
of
fun
and
much
development
in
trying
to
maintain
the
family
of
dolls
under
pioneer
conditions
calling
for
all
sorts
of
clever
makeshifts
there
are
numberless
things
that
will
go
to
make
up
the
little
girl
doll
house
and
her
activities
can
be
extended
over
the
entire
period
during
which
she
cares
to
play
with
dolls
at
first
she
will
be
satisfied
with
handling
her
baby
and
putting
her
to
sleep
later
she
will
want
to
dress
and
undress
it
before
long
she
will
have
a
whole
family
of
dolls
and
will
want
to
prepare
their
meals
for
them
sew
and
wash
their
clothes
and
keep
the
house
in
order
these
growing
needs
on
her
part
are
just
as
real
as
the
needs
adults
feel
and
it
would
be
just
as
unwise
to
get
her
a
new
doll
when
she
needs
most
of
all
a
for
her
kitchen
as
it
would
be
to
buy
for
yourself
a
picture
when
you
really
need
a
pair
of
new
spectacles
all
the
different
articles
needed
for
the
running
of
the
house
can
now
be
bought
separately
in
buying
the
different
articles
the
things
to
keep
in
mind
are
usability
simplicity
and
durability
the
furniture
that
you
buy
or
make
must
be
able
to
serve
the
ostensible
purpose
of
doll
furniture
it
is
better
to
get
one
chair
that
is
of
the
right
size
for
the
doll
well
proportioned
and
strong
enough
to
stand
the
handling
of
the
owner
than
a
whole
set
of
pretty
and
flimsy
and
useless
furniture
that
you
can
buy
in
a
gay
box
for
the
same
price
of
course
it
is
understood
that
the
principles
of
usability
simplicity
and
durability
apply
to
the
dolls
themselves
it
is
now
easy
to
obtain
dolls
with
indestructible
heads
and
with
jointed
bodies
made
of
durable
material
the
little
baby
will
love
the
doll
with
a
felt
head
it
can
stand
being
loved
hard
without
losing
some
of
its
features
to
give
a
little
girl
a
doll
that
is
so
finely
dressed
and
so
daintily
constructed
that
she
is
permitted
to
come
out
of
her
box
only
on
state
occasions
is
a
violation
of
every
sound
principle
of
child
training
and
fair
dealing
i
have
mentioned
as
examples
of
the
kind
of
toys
that
can
be
bought
singly
and
grouped
about
some
central
idea
the
farm
and
the
house
but
of
course
there
are
many
other
things
railroads
with
their
equipment
dairies
stores
of
all
kinds
etc
besides
the
toys
that
are
related
to
various
lines
of
activity
each
child
as
soon
as
he
is
old
enough
wants
the
opportunity
to
work
with
materials
and
tools
the
youngest
children
can
have
beads
to
string
mosaic
blocks
with
which
patterns
can
be
made
etc
for
the
older
children
you
can
get
materials
for
sewing
painting
parquetry
work
and
the
like
there
are
boxes
containing
wooden
and
iron
construction
strips
out
of
which
bridges
houses
airships
and
all
sorts
of
exciting
things
can
be
made
for
the
growing
boy
nothing
is
more
appropriate
than
some
carpentry
tools
of
his
own
here
again
we
must
remember
that
it
is
better
to
buy
a
few
good
tools
and
gradually
build
up
an
equipment
than
to
buy
a
set
that
looks
well
enough
in
the
store
but
goes
to
pieces
under
real
usage
a
or
toy
typewriter
a
camera
or
scroll
saw
will
afford
hours
of
helpful
amusement
and
instruction
musical
instruments
are
always
acceptable
the
metalophone
is
one
of
the
simplest
from
which
you
can
get
real
music
the
cheapest
is
just
as
usable
as
the
more
expensive
although
of
course
it
does
not
have
so
wide
a
range
of
notes
it
is
impossible
to
enumerate
all
the
indoor
group
games
that
are
offered
but
in
selecting
a
game
you
must
make
sure
that
it
really
has
some
sense
in
it
and
that
it
does
not
stimulate
the
gambling
spirit
as
do
so
many
of
the
games
with
dice
or
a
spinning
wheel
as
a
part
of
the
equipment
all
toys
that
encourage
healthy
outdoor
sports
are
worth
while
a
great
deal
of
the
progress
in
has
been
along
mechanical
lines
until
we
are
confronted
with
the
most
intricate
mechanical
contrivances
they
are
interesting
at
an
exhibition
and
most
likely
the
child
will
be
attracted
by
them
and
will
want
them
but
only
to
look
at
and
own
he
will
tire
of
them
much
more
quickly
than
he
would
of
the
simple
usable
toy
in
this
respect
the
children
of
the
rich
are
to
be
pitied
they
are
overloaded
with
these
expensive
mechanical
toys
which
overstimulate
them
at
first
and
later
bore
them
the
educative
value
of
simple
games
with
sticks
and
stones
or
anything
the
child
may
happen
to
pick
up
is
far
greater
and
calls
for
more
exercise
of
imagination
and
ingenuity
and
the
other
qualities
we
desire
to
foster
than
is
that
of
the
elaborate
mechanical
toys
it
would
be
very
desirable
if
all
the
skill
and
enterprise
that
is
devoted
to
the
development
of
the
toy
industry
were
applied
to
making
toys
simpler
more
durable
and
cheaper
instead
of
making
them
more
elaborate
more
realistic
and
more
flimsy
however
the
desirable
kinds
of
toys
will
not
be
manufactured
in
larger
quantities
until
an
enlightened
parenthood
both
demands
them
and
refuses
to
buy
the
glittering
that
look
so
charming
in
the
shop
but
go
to
pieces
in
the
child
hands
it
is
far
better
to
have
fewer
and
better
toys
than
more
of
an
inferior
quality
the
thing
to
keep
in
mind
is
that
a
toy
is
neither
an
artistic
model
an
aesthetic
ornament
nor
a
mechanical
spectacle
but
should
be
a
stimulus
to
call
forth
invention
ingenuity
imagination
and
skill
x
children
gangs
clubs
and
friendships
what
a
plague
boys
are
sighed
brown
that
white
boy
has
been
getting
our
harry
into
all
sorts
of
mischief
and
i
ca
make
harry
give
up
that
gang
green
agreed
that
boys
were
a
plague
her
jack
went
with
a
lot
of
boys
too
and
they
were
always
up
to
some
sort
of
tricks
which
she
was
quite
sure
boy
would
never
do
if
it
were
not
for
those
other
boys
and
green
was
right
any
boy
will
do
things
when
he
is
with
the
gang
that
he
never
would
think
of
doing
alone
and
that
he
would
dare
to
do
alone
if
he
did
think
of
them
even
your
boy
and
mine
too
i
hope
that
the
way
of
boys
what
we
mothers
will
have
to
do
is
to
stop
fretting
about
the
other
boys
in
the
gang
who
spoil
our
boys
and
about
the
mischief
and
noise
and
dirty
boots
and
staying
away
late
for
meals
and
get
down
to
a
practical
way
of
making
all
the
boys
in
the
gang
as
we
find
them
into
a
lot
of
decent
young
men
we
shall
have
to
stop
trying
to
make
boys
do
what
it
is
impossible
for
them
to
do
and
we
shall
have
to
stop
trying
to
keep
the
boys
from
doing
what
it
is
absolutely
necessary
that
they
should
do
if
they
are
to
develop
into
the
decent
young
men
we
have
in
mind
the
modern
way
the
efficient
way
of
treating
children
is
to
find
out
their
instincts
and
then
use
these
almost
irresistible
forces
of
nature
as
a
means
of
directing
their
development
and
that
is
what
we
shall
have
to
do
with
the
boy
and
his
gang
and
that
is
what
we
shall
have
to
do
with
the
girl
and
her
set
the
boy
is
a
more
serious
problem
because
under
the
promptings
of
his
instincts
he
soon
becomes
indifferent
to
the
attractions
and
amusements
of
the
home
and
seeks
the
companionship
of
boys
of
his
own
age
and
he
seeks
activities
that
can
not
for
the
most
part
be
carried
on
in
the
home
the
girl
on
the
other
hand
remains
much
longer
subject
to
the
will
of
her
mother
and
to
the
conventions
and
standards
of
the
home
she
remains
for
a
longer
period
satisfied
with
the
kinds
of
activities
that
can
be
carried
on
at
home
we
have
been
told
over
and
over
again
that
the
instincts
of
childhood
are
all
for
activity
and
a
few
of
us
have
trained
ourselves
not
to
expect
the
children
to
all
the
time
of
course
there
are
times
when
we
simply
must
have
them
be
still
and
of
course
we
allow
the
teachers
to
insist
upon
the
children
being
still
in
school
but
we
recognize
that
they
must
play
and
romp
and
run
and
shout
and
we
are
willing
even
to
spend
public
funds
for
playgrounds
this
shows
that
we
can
learn
and
that
we
can
make
use
of
our
knowledge
it
is
necessary
only
that
we
extend
our
knowledge
of
the
instincts
of
our
children
just
as
fast
as
we
can
make
use
of
more
up
to
the
age
of
about
ten
boys
are
apparently
satisfied
to
play
games
by
themselves
or
to
play
with
others
in
ways
that
let
each
look
out
pretty
much
for
himself
at
this
age
however
a
change
begins
to
appear
now
the
boy
tends
to
associate
himself
with
others
of
the
same
age
and
before
you
know
it
your
son
belongs
to
some
gang
every
street
in
a
town
and
every
corner
in
a
city
has
its
gang
and
if
your
boy
has
red
blood
and
hard
grit
in
him
he
is
a
member
of
one
of
these
gangs
he
ca
help
it
he
does
not
join
because
it
is
the
fashion
or
because
he
is
afraid
to
keep
out
or
because
he
has
social
ambitions
he
joins
because
it
is
his
instinct
to
join
with
others
in
carrying
on
the
activities
to
which
other
instincts
drive
him
if
you
stand
in
the
way
of
the
gang
you
are
fighting
against
one
of
the
strongest
forces
in
human
nature
now
if
you
feel
the
way
brown
and
green
felt
about
the
gangs
i
do
not
blame
you
but
you
must
not
stop
there
let
try
to
find
out
first
what
the
gang
means
to
the
boys
and
what
it
means
to
the
race
when
a
boy
joins
a
gang
he
does
not
discard
his
instinct
for
play
or
for
running
and
shouting
he
simply
takes
on
a
new
relation
to
the
world
about
him
as
a
member
of
the
gang
he
still
runs
and
plays
and
shouts
but
now
he
has
become
conscious
of
his
place
in
the
world
and
that
place
is
with
his
surrounded
by
all
sorts
of
enemies
and
dangers
and
obstacles
to
his
in
his
gang
he
finds
comfort
and
support
for
his
struggle
with
the
outside
world
here
he
finds
opportunity
for
satisfying
exchange
of
thought
here
he
finds
sympathy
and
understanding
such
as
he
can
get
nowhere
else
the
gang
without
a
written
code
in
most
cases
without
formal
rules
without
very
definite
aims
even
nevertheless
has
a
moral
scheme
of
its
own
that
every
boy
understands
and
lives
up
to
as
earnestly
and
as
devotedly
as
ever
man
followed
the
dictates
of
conscience
the
gang
demands
of
the
boy
unfailing
loyalty
and
what
is
more
it
usually
gets
it
of
how
many
other
institutions
or
organizations
can
as
much
be
said
the
gang
demands
fair
play
and
fidelity
among
its
members
and
it
usually
gets
these
the
gang
demands
devotion
and
of
its
members
and
the
boy
who
can
not
show
these
qualities
becomes
more
effectually
ostracized
than
any
defaulting
bank
official
or
corrupt
politician
these
fine
virtues
then
loyalty
honor
devotion
are
cultivated
by
the
gang
just
at
the
time
when
the
instincts
for
them
are
strongest
and
at
a
time
when
no
other
agency
is
prepared
to
do
the
work
for
you
will
realize
when
you
once
think
of
it
how
much
we
coddle
the
baby
when
he
is
cute
how
we
shower
him
with
toys
far
in
excess
of
what
he
can
use
or
enjoy
how
we
fuss
and
fondle
him
and
how
much
thought
we
give
to
every
possible
and
impossible
want
and
how
on
the
other
hand
we
neglect
the
boy
when
he
enters
upon
that
most
unattractive
but
very
critical
age
in
which
he
finds
other
boys
more
interesting
than
his
sister
and
her
dolls
when
he
cares
more
for
other
boys
than
he
does
for
his
mother
and
her
parlor
when
he
thinks
more
of
the
fellers
than
he
does
of
his
teacher
and
her
lessons
just
at
this
time
when
the
boy
is
beginning
to
wonder
vaguely
and
to
long
just
as
indefinitely
we
abandon
him
to
his
own
resources
and
to
white
bob
the
leader
of
the
gang
the
problem
that
confronts
us
is
how
can
we
save
and
strengthen
the
fine
qualities
which
this
spontaneous
association
with
other
boys
produces
without
encouraging
the
lawlessness
and
the
destructiveness
and
the
secretiveness
of
the
gang
first
of
all
we
mothers
must
recognize
not
only
that
the
boy
can
not
be
happy
without
his
associates
but
also
that
the
social
virtues
will
never
be
developed
in
him
at
all
if
we
keep
him
at
home
away
from
the
others
or
restricted
to
one
or
two
which
we
may
like
to
select
for
him
then
when
this
is
perfectly
clear
to
us
we
will
take
the
next
step
which
will
be
to
use
all
the
resources
of
the
homes
and
of
the
community
to
change
the
antisocial
gang
into
a
club
the
difference
between
a
gang
and
a
is
not
a
matter
of
clean
clothes
and
nice
manners
it
is
a
difference
in
mental
attitude
the
gang
has
rules
and
it
has
power
the
club
has
put
its
rules
into
form
and
it
what
it
can
do
and
what
it
wants
to
do
in
other
words
the
gang
is
a
casual
random
group
that
drifts
about
in
the
village
or
in
the
city
subject
to
every
passing
influence
whereas
the
club
is
a
deliberate
purposeful
organization
with
definite
aims
and
developments
both
meet
the
needs
of
the
growing
boy
for
association
both
give
the
social
instincts
and
virtues
suitable
opportunity
for
exercise
this
problem
of
giving
the
boys
a
chance
to
get
together
and
do
what
their
instincts
drive
them
to
do
is
not
one
merely
for
the
mothers
who
can
provide
for
their
boys
little
or
no
supervision
and
whose
boys
play
in
the
streets
and
vacant
lots
the
problem
is
just
as
great
in
the
case
of
the
who
provide
constant
supervision
for
their
children
indeed
it
is
a
serious
question
whether
the
condition
of
the
children
of
wealthier
families
is
not
in
this
respect
more
dangerous
than
that
of
the
less
wealthy
with
the
boys
of
the
street
the
problem
is
how
to
divert
the
activities
into
suitable
channels
with
the
boys
of
the
wealthy
the
problem
is
how
to
develop
the
spirit
of
loyalty
and
and
honor
which
have
been
suppressed
by
the
restricted
and
artificial
associations
of
the
solicitous
home
both
kinds
of
boys
must
be
left
free
to
form
their
own
associations
but
the
groups
must
be
so
directed
in
their
club
activities
without
however
suspecting
that
they
are
being
directed
as
to
connect
their
interests
with
lawful
amusements
civic
needs
and
social
relations
the
great
danger
is
that
when
adults
take
a
hand
in
these
matters
they
fix
their
attention
upon
the
civic
and
moral
virtues
and
overlook
the
instincts
of
activity
and
sociability
which
call
the
gang
into
being
and
the
club
degenerates
into
a
preachy
school
class
illustration
the
boys
need
a
chance
to
get
together
in
organizing
clubs
or
rather
in
presenting
opportunities
for
the
organization
of
clubs
we
must
recognize
that
bodily
activity
taking
the
form
of
athletics
or
of
workshop
effort
or
of
camping
hunting
is
a
fundamental
condition
of
healthy
growth
for
the
boys
and
girls
as
every
group
must
have
its
meeting
place
this
should
be
first
provided
and
it
should
be
of
a
nature
that
allows
gymnastics
and
hammering
and
boxing
to
go
on
without
any
restrictions
beyond
those
required
by
the
nature
of
the
little
animals
that
is
there
is
need
for
sleep
and
rest
and
meals
and
perhaps
certain
definite
hours
for
school
and
church
but
beyond
such
disagreeable
though
necessary
interruptions
the
meeting
place
of
the
club
should
be
a
busy
place
at
all
decent
hours
we
are
tempted
to
force
literature
and
debating
upon
our
clubs
these
things
usually
come
later
and
appeal
at
best
to
but
relatively
few
boys
literature
and
debating
are
good
but
they
can
never
take
the
place
of
parallel
bars
and
boxing
gloves
and
hammer
and
saw
we
are
also
tempted
to
pick
out
the
boys
for
the
clubs
that
we
are
interested
in
this
is
a
serious
mistake
it
is
this
sort
of
thing
that
causes
the
failure
of
so
many
attempts
to
redeem
the
children
of
the
slums
or
of
the
street
we
must
let
the
groups
form
spontaneously
the
boys
instincts
are
keener
in
detecting
the
sneak
and
the
coward
and
the
traitor
than
yours
are
and
if
the
club
has
the
right
start
the
undesirable
citizen
will
either
adopt
the
morals
of
the
club
or
be
squeezed
out
and
the
right
start
is
chiefly
a
good
meeting
place
it
is
here
that
the
church
and
the
school
and
the
home
can
cooperate
in
the
larger
cities
the
settlement
has
pointed
the
way
by
carrying
on
practically
all
of
the
work
with
children
through
the
medium
of
clubs
it
is
not
necessary
for
every
parent
to
furnish
a
suitable
meeting
place
indeed
each
club
needs
only
one
meeting
place
but
every
home
can
contribute
something
if
you
have
not
the
suitable
garret
or
barn
or
shed
you
can
supply
the
baseball
outfit
or
the
indian
clubs
or
the
or
some
of
the
tools
you
can
lend
your
homes
for
those
not
very
frequent
occasions
when
the
boys
are
quite
satisfied
to
have
a
quiet
evening
of
table
games
or
theatricals
or
imitation
with
chestnuts
to
roast
and
songs
to
sing
you
can
make
up
for
fishing
or
tramping
trips
or
you
can
sew
tapes
on
the
old
pants
for
uniforms
it
does
not
matter
so
much
you
do
so
long
as
you
do
as
much
as
you
can
and
above
all
if
you
show
an
interest
the
bond
of
sympathy
and
intimacy
that
comes
from
such
an
understanding
and
from
the
hearty
cooperation
of
the
home
with
these
natural
instincts
of
the
children
is
an
immense
gain
to
the
individual
parent
as
well
as
to
the
individual
child
instead
of
friction
and
opposition
of
forces
there
results
a
cooperation
of
forces
that
all
make
for
good
as
for
the
community
the
village
or
town
that
can
provide
meeting
places
for
all
of
its
groups
of
young
people
under
the
direction
of
those
who
understand
them
and
sympathize
with
them
with
suitable
equipment
for
physical
activities
of
all
kinds
can
make
no
better
investment
of
the
money
that
such
a
venture
would
cost
for
it
is
in
such
association
that
the
boys
and
girls
learn
to
be
members
of
a
group
and
eventually
of
the
larger
group
that
includes
us
all
the
good
citizen
is
the
one
who
has
developed
the
instincts
of
loyalty
and
devotion
and
and
honor
and
has
directed
them
toward
the
community
the
bad
citizen
is
the
one
in
whom
these
virtues
were
never
developed
or
one
in
whom
these
traits
remain
in
the
gang
stage
in
the
attempts
that
have
been
made
to
direct
the
instincts
of
children
we
have
given
the
boys
much
more
attention
than
the
girls
for
the
simple
reason
that
the
boys
have
given
us
more
trouble
still
the
girls
should
not
be
neglected
they
are
entitled
to
all
the
advantages
that
can
be
derived
from
organized
opportunity
to
associate
with
one
another
and
to
develop
the
social
virtues
they
should
also
have
the
opportunity
for
physical
exercise
and
development
which
the
boy
gets
because
he
makes
violent
demand
for
it
but
which
the
girl
needs
just
as
much
it
has
been
found
unwise
to
have
mixed
clubs
of
boys
and
girls
in
the
early
years
and
even
later
when
girls
and
boys
could
profitably
associate
together
they
like
to
have
their
separate
groups
for
special
activities
for
the
strictly
sociable
times
however
boys
and
girls
may
be
brought
together
at
any
age
apart
from
the
other
advantages
to
be
gained
from
the
club
the
girl
or
boy
will
be
saved
from
his
friends
there
is
a
real
danger
that
children
who
do
not
get
into
larger
groups
will
take
up
with
a
single
chum
or
intimate
while
it
is
true
that
many
lasting
and
valued
friendships
start
in
these
early
years
the
danger
is
nevertheless
a
serious
one
chums
or
intimates
in
their
tendency
to
get
away
from
other
people
may
do
nothing
worse
than
carry
on
silly
conversations
but
they
may
also
read
pernicious
literature
and
develop
bad
habits
activities
in
a
group
are
more
open
and
less
likely
to
be
of
a
secret
nature
intimacies
at
this
early
age
will
spring
up
for
all
kinds
of
superficial
reasons
in
a
study
made
some
years
ago
these
were
some
of
the
reasons
given
for
the
formation
of
friendships
we
were
cousins
he
taught
me
to
swim
we
had
the
same
birthday
she
had
a
red
apron
her
brown
eyes
and
hair
neither
of
us
had
a
sister
a
large
proportion
of
the
children
who
were
questioned
gave
as
the
only
reason
for
their
intimate
friendship
the
fact
that
they
live
near
each
other
however
absurd
these
reasons
may
appear
to
us
we
are
compelled
by
what
we
know
of
the
child
mind
to
respect
these
attachments
but
if
there
is
any
danger
in
the
intimacy
and
there
often
is
the
only
remedy
is
encouragement
of
association
in
a
large
group
there
is
safety
in
numbers
so
whether
we
are
more
concerned
with
the
mischief
done
by
the
gang
or
with
the
danger
of
intimate
chums
whether
we
care
more
for
the
development
of
good
citizenship
in
boys
and
girls
or
merely
to
make
the
children
happy
while
they
are
growing
up
it
is
necessary
for
parents
to
use
all
the
means
at
their
disposal
to
organize
and
encourage
the
social
activities
of
the
young
people
to
the
fullest
extent
xi
children
ideals
and
ambitions
when
you
take
pains
to
instruct
your
children
in
the
way
they
should
go
it
is
because
you
have
in
mind
certain
standards
of
what
a
child
should
do
or
of
what
kind
of
an
adult
you
wish
your
child
to
become
in
other
words
you
look
to
your
ideals
to
guide
you
in
the
training
of
the
child
we
all
appreciate
more
or
less
vaguely
the
importance
of
ideals
in
shaping
character
and
for
this
reason
we
value
ideals
although
it
is
considered
smart
for
adults
to
sneer
at
ideals
and
idealism
which
are
supposed
somehow
to
be
opposed
to
the
practical
affairs
of
life
but
in
a
way
there
is
nothing
more
truly
practical
than
a
worthy
ideal
where
there
is
no
vision
the
people
perish
and
that
is
just
as
true
of
the
individual
as
it
is
of
a
nation
moreover
it
is
the
who
shall
see
the
visions
and
draw
from
them
the
inspiration
for
higher
and
better
things
fortunately
every
normal
child
develops
ideals
it
is
for
more
experienced
people
to
provide
the
opportunities
for
the
formation
of
desirable
ideals
to
guide
the
ideals
after
they
are
formed
into
practicable
channels
to
use
the
ideals
to
reinforce
the
will
in
carrying
out
our
practical
purposes
in
the
training
of
the
child
you
no
doubt
find
it
easy
enough
to
recognize
and
to
encourage
ideals
that
are
in
harmony
with
your
own
or
that
seem
to
you
worthy
and
likely
to
have
a
favorable
influence
upon
your
child
career
or
character
when
freddy
says
that
he
wants
to
become
a
lawyer
or
a
doctor
you
encourage
him
you
say
that
fine
my
boy
and
in
your
mind
eye
you
see
him
climbing
to
fame
and
fortune
but
when
freddy
says
that
he
wants
to
be
a
policeman
and
marry
the
you
laugh
at
him
and
you
certainly
do
encourage
him
but
in
freddy
mind
doctor
and
lawyer
mean
no
more
than
policeman
they
involve
no
more
important
social
service
they
mean
no
more
dignity
in
personal
position
they
suggest
nothing
more
of
anything
that
is
worth
while
for
whatever
it
is
that
freddy
wants
to
be
at
any
moment
is
to
him
the
sum
of
all
that
is
to
him
worth
while
and
that
is
just
what
an
ideal
ought
to
be
this
is
not
a
plea
to
cruel
parents
in
behalf
of
smoothing
path
toward
the
coveted
post
or
the
course
of
his
courtship
of
the
daughter
it
is
simply
an
effort
to
point
out
how
important
it
is
to
avoid
shattering
early
in
life
that
precious
mirror
in
which
alone
visions
are
to
be
seen
when
you
have
ridiculed
the
policeman
out
of
further
consideration
you
are
likely
with
the
same
act
to
have
weakened
freddy
faith
in
ideals
and
to
this
extent
you
have
loosened
one
of
the
safest
props
of
his
character
we
need
not
be
afraid
of
the
crude
and
ideals
of
the
young
child
with
the
growth
of
his
experience
his
ideals
will
expand
we
should
fear
rather
to
infect
him
with
the
vulgar
disrespect
for
all
ideals
in
a
few
years
freddy
has
his
heart
set
on
charting
the
blank
spaces
on
his
geography
map
and
he
has
never
a
thought
for
the
girls
it
is
the
same
freddy
but
he
has
in
the
meanwhile
roamed
far
from
the
home
neighborhood
in
imagination
and
has
discovered
new
heroes
and
new
types
of
heroism
the
policeman
and
the
are
still
at
their
old
posts
but
freddy
ignores
them
because
his
ideals
have
grown
with
his
experience
and
his
information
as
well
as
with
his
bodily
growth
and
development
study
of
thousands
of
children
in
all
parts
of
this
country
in
england
and
in
germany
has
shown
that
the
young
people
begin
to
form
ideal
images
of
what
they
consider
desirable
or
beautiful
or
right
rather
early
in
life
they
form
ideals
of
virtue
as
well
as
ideals
of
happiness
and
these
ideals
reflect
their
experiences
and
their
surroundings
to
a
remarkable
degree
thus
there
are
differences
between
the
ideals
formed
by
country
children
and
those
formed
by
city
children
between
the
ideals
of
poor
children
and
those
of
wealthy
ones
between
the
ideals
of
english
children
and
those
of
american
or
german
children
but
aside
from
all
these
differences
it
is
found
that
the
ideals
vary
with
the
sex
of
the
child
and
also
with
the
age
so
that
each
child
passes
through
a
series
of
stages
marked
by
characteristic
types
of
ideals
as
early
as
the
age
of
nine
years
children
have
expressed
themselves
as
looking
forward
to
doing
good
in
the
world
or
to
making
themselves
good
the
age
at
which
this
impulse
to
service
or
to
personal
perfection
may
take
form
must
depend
upon
many
things
besides
the
peculiar
characteristics
of
the
individual
child
jessie
ideals
concerning
being
good
will
be
shaped
by
what
she
hears
and
sees
about
her
if
you
speak
frequently
about
the
foreign
missions
she
may
think
of
being
good
as
something
that
has
to
do
with
the
heathen
if
the
family
conversation
takes
into
consideration
the
sick
and
the
needy
jessie
ideal
may
be
dressed
like
a
red
cross
nurse
if
you
never
speak
of
the
larger
problems
of
community
welfare
or
of
social
needs
or
of
moral
advance
in
the
home
where
robert
has
a
chance
to
hear
you
he
can
get
suggestions
toward
such
ideals
only
after
he
has
read
enough
to
become
acquainted
with
these
problems
and
the
corresponding
lines
of
service
for
himself
answers
received
from
hundreds
of
girls
and
boys
would
seem
to
show
that
virtue
and
goodness
are
desirable
to
children
at
a
certain
stage
of
their
development
chiefly
if
not
solely
because
they
bring
material
or
social
benefits
virtue
is
rewarded
not
by
any
internal
or
spiritual
satisfaction
but
by
freer
access
to
the
candy
supply
or
to
the
skating
pond
the
right
is
that
which
is
allowable
or
that
which
may
be
practiced
with
impunity
the
wrong
is
that
which
is
forbidden
or
punishable
of
course
this
attitude
toward
moral
values
should
not
continue
through
life
we
should
do
what
we
can
to
establish
higher
ideals
of
right
and
wrong
how
soon
this
change
will
come
must
depend
very
largely
on
where
the
emphasis
is
laid
by
those
around
the
child
if
when
you
give
robert
a
piece
of
candy
you
always
impress
him
with
the
idea
that
this
is
his
compensation
for
having
been
good
he
will
retain
this
association
between
virtue
and
material
reward
long
past
the
age
when
he
can
already
appreciate
the
satisfaction
that
comes
from
exercising
his
instinct
to
be
helpful
or
from
doing
what
he
thinks
is
right
if
however
the
idea
in
the
home
is
that
all
goes
well
and
all
feel
cheerful
and
happy
because
every
one
is
trying
to
do
the
right
thing
the
various
indulgences
and
liberties
will
mean
to
the
child
merely
the
material
manifestations
of
the
good
feeling
that
prevails
and
not
rewards
of
virtue
so
far
as
possible
rewards
and
punishments
should
be
directed
toward
the
and
not
the
child
the
aim
should
be
to
make
the
child
derive
his
highest
satisfaction
from
carrying
out
his
own
ideals
of
conduct
rather
than
from
the
reward
for
that
conduct
the
approbation
of
those
he
honors
and
loves
should
gradually
replace
the
material
reward
to
the
child
the
ideal
of
success
may
mean
two
entirely
different
things
at
one
stage
it
may
mean
the
satisfaction
of
accomplishing
a
set
task
whether
selected
by
himself
or
imposed
by
some
one
else
later
it
comes
to
mean
excelling
some
other
child
in
a
contest
even
a
child
of
four
or
five
years
gets
a
great
deal
of
satisfaction
from
contemplating
a
house
he
has
built
out
of
his
blocks
or
the
row
of
mud
pies
this
satisfaction
gradually
comes
to
be
something
quite
distinct
from
the
pleasure
of
and
is
an
important
element
in
the
ideal
of
workmanship
as
the
child
grows
older
the
ideal
of
successful
accomplishment
grows
stronger
and
if
it
is
retained
throughout
life
it
contributes
a
large
share
toward
the
individual
happiness
most
of
the
school
activities
of
our
children
lay
too
much
emphasis
upon
the
ideal
of
successful
rivalry
and
too
little
upon
the
ideal
of
high
achievement
the
ideal
set
before
the
children
is
not
frequently
enough
that
of
doing
the
best
that
is
in
them
and
too
frequently
that
of
doing
merely
better
than
the
neighbor
which
may
be
poor
enough
some
of
the
work
done
with
children
in
clubs
outside
of
schools
has
brought
out
the
instinct
for
an
ideal
of
achievement
in
a
very
good
way
richard
came
home
quite
breathless
when
he
was
able
to
report
that
he
could
start
a
fire
on
a
windy
day
using
but
a
single
match
in
some
of
the
more
modern
organizations
for
girls
as
well
as
for
boys
graded
tasks
are
assigned
as
tests
of
individual
proficiency
or
prowess
every
girl
and
every
boy
must
pass
these
standards
without
regard
to
what
the
others
do
the
result
of
encouraging
this
ideal
is
likely
to
be
an
increased
sense
of
responsibility
well
as
an
increased
whereas
the
ideal
of
beating
others
may
in
many
cases
keep
the
girl
or
boy
at
a
rather
low
level
of
achievement
compared
to
the
child
own
capacity
this
competitive
ideal
is
illustrated
by
the
girl
who
is
ambitious
to
stand
at
the
head
of
her
class
and
receives
encouragement
enough
but
we
give
very
little
thought
to
the
child
whose
ideals
are
for
service
to
others
or
to
the
community
it
is
very
often
the
same
child
that
at
one
time
glories
in
successful
emulation
under
the
encouragement
of
our
approval
and
that
later
fails
to
develop
the
germs
of
altruistic
ideals
because
we
fail
to
recognize
or
at
least
to
encourage
them
we
can
not
expect
from
the
schools
an
early
change
of
emphasis
from
the
competitive
type
of
ambition
to
the
ideal
of
cooperation
or
service
although
the
teachers
who
have
tried
to
encourage
the
latter
have
found
the
school
work
to
proceed
more
satisfactorily
than
it
does
under
the
spirit
of
emulation
but
in
the
home
it
should
be
much
easier
to
encourage
these
higher
types
of
ideals
for
we
do
not
have
to
set
one
child
against
the
other
and
there
is
greater
opportunity
for
individual
service
on
account
of
the
greater
differences
in
the
ages
and
attainments
of
the
children
it
is
interesting
and
significant
that
of
the
thousands
of
children
who
have
given
expression
to
their
ideals
and
ambitions
a
very
small
number
less
than
one
in
every
hundred
have
appeared
to
be
quite
content
with
themselves
and
with
their
surroundings
the
normal
child
craves
for
some
thing
better
and
roams
as
far
afield
as
his
knowledge
and
opportunities
let
him
in
his
search
for
the
best
it
is
during
the
years
from
the
tenth
to
the
fifteenth
or
sixteenth
that
this
search
is
keenest
and
during
this
period
we
should
present
to
the
children
every
opportunity
for
becoming
acquainted
with
what
has
been
considered
best
in
the
history
of
the
race
the
reading
that
the
boy
or
girl
does
at
this
time
is
perhaps
the
most
important
source
of
ideals
the
selection
of
suitable
books
for
the
young
is
in
itself
an
important
problem
and
one
that
many
of
us
are
apt
to
neglect
it
is
impossible
to
judge
of
the
desirability
or
suitableness
of
a
book
from
its
appearance
or
from
its
price
or
from
the
standing
of
its
publishers
or
even
from
the
repute
of
the
author
many
books
are
not
only
worthless
but
positively
objectionable
if
it
is
not
possible
for
you
to
examine
carefully
each
book
that
you
consider
buying
you
should
make
use
of
an
annotated
list
or
seek
competent
counsel
in
some
other
form
through
libraries
and
various
associations
it
is
now
possible
to
obtain
carefully
prepared
lists
that
will
be
helpful
in
selecting
books
for
children
of
all
ages
an
interesting
point
that
has
been
brought
out
by
studies
is
the
fact
that
degrading
ideals
are
practically
wanting
in
children
you
were
no
doubt
shocked
to
discover
that
eddy
was
planning
to
become
a
burglar
or
a
pirate
chief
or
a
tramp
or
an
ordinary
highwayman
but
a
careful
analysis
of
the
motives
and
experiences
of
the
boy
will
show
that
the
particular
feature
that
eddy
admires
in
his
hero
is
far
removed
from
the
ones
that
shock
you
the
boy
is
dreaming
of
travel
and
adventure
of
the
excitement
of
chasing
or
of
being
chased
of
trying
his
ingenuity
in
conflict
with
the
professionally
ingenious
minions
of
the
law
of
being
brave
in
the
face
of
danger
of
testing
his
fortitude
in
the
time
of
trouble
of
the
loyalty
of
his
comrades
to
himself
as
leader
or
of
his
loyalty
to
his
chief
when
the
latter
is
beset
by
his
enemies
but
courage
and
loyalty
and
fortitude
and
ingenuity
are
no
more
degrading
ideals
than
are
material
possessions
and
intellectual
accomplishments
only
it
happens
that
many
boys
find
these
particular
ideals
embodied
in
heroes
and
personalities
that
we
feel
we
must
disapprove
for
various
reasons
robin
hood
appeals
to
the
children
not
because
he
violated
the
laws
of
the
land
or
because
he
deprived
people
of
their
property
but
because
he
was
brave
and
clever
and
just
and
kind
to
the
poor
in
comparing
the
ideals
of
children
raised
in
the
city
with
those
of
children
raised
in
the
country
interesting
differences
appear
the
city
children
are
in
general
less
inclined
to
be
altruistic
than
country
children
at
the
same
age
on
the
other
hand
city
children
draw
upon
a
wider
range
of
characters
from
history
and
from
fiction
for
their
ideals
in
the
matter
of
future
occupations
city
children
were
often
satisfied
to
mention
some
preference
from
the
various
occupations
of
which
they
had
heard
without
elaborating
the
details
whereas
the
country
children
although
they
did
not
select
from
so
wide
a
range
frequently
described
special
features
of
some
occupation
as
the
interesting
elements
leading
to
a
choice
from
the
various
studies
that
have
been
made
we
may
see
that
the
kind
of
ideals
that
a
child
is
likely
to
have
depends
a
great
deal
upon
the
with
whom
he
becomes
familiar
upon
the
with
which
he
becomes
familiar
and
upon
the
with
which
he
becomes
familiar
the
child
should
have
an
opportunity
to
discover
the
best
that
is
available
in
his
immediate
environment
his
earliest
heroes
should
be
his
parents
then
the
acquaintances
near
home
should
furnish
the
qualities
that
will
arouse
his
interest
and
admiration
it
is
a
mistake
to
thrust
upon
the
child
ideals
ready
made
and
imported
for
the
purpose
a
hero
thrust
upon
the
young
imagination
may
do
service
for
a
while
but
is
likely
to
be
discarded
later
when
that
particular
hero
virtues
really
need
to
be
kept
before
the
child
much
more
than
they
did
in
the
earlier
period
george
washington
and
his
hatchet
have
furnished
us
a
legend
that
is
a
good
illustration
of
this
the
hero
is
dressed
up
to
be
attractive
to
children
of
nursery
age
and
endowed
with
nursery
virtues
when
the
children
grow
up
and
so
outgrow
their
nursery
ideals
they
discard
interest
in
and
admiration
for
george
washington
this
is
a
serious
loss
to
our
national
idealism
the
results
of
the
studies
also
indicate
how
significant
is
suitable
literature
in
the
formation
of
ideals
a
comparison
of
returns
from
girls
with
those
from
boys
throws
an
important
side
light
on
this
problem
in
nearly
every
group
of
answers
received
it
was
evident
that
most
girls
when
they
get
to
a
certain
age
adopt
ideals
that
are
decidedly
masculine
the
explanation
of
this
seems
to
lie
in
the
fact
that
the
characters
of
history
and
of
literature
with
whom
they
become
most
familiar
are
those
showing
distinctly
masculine
qualities
there
are
real
differences
between
the
mind
of
a
girl
and
the
mind
of
a
boy
and
these
should
be
taken
into
consideration
in
their
training
there
is
great
need
for
the
clearer
recognition
and
sharper
definition
of
distinctly
feminine
ideals
it
is
not
enough
to
transfer
some
imitation
masculine
ideals
to
the
minds
of
our
girls
we
should
make
a
special
effort
to
discover
our
children
ideals
for
several
reasons
first
of
all
by
knowing
what
the
girl
or
boy
has
nearest
the
heart
we
shall
be
able
to
enter
into
closer
sympathy
with
the
child
we
shall
be
able
to
understand
much
of
the
conduct
that
would
otherwise
baffle
as
well
as
annoy
us
in
the
second
place
by
watching
the
rise
of
ideals
we
shall
be
better
able
to
direct
the
child
playing
and
his
reading
and
those
other
activities
that
are
needed
to
supply
the
experiences
and
ideas
that
seem
to
be
lacking
or
to
discourage
tendencies
that
seem
to
us
undesirable
in
the
third
place
if
we
know
our
children
ideals
we
can
make
use
of
these
as
motive
forces
in
helping
us
to
carry
out
our
larger
plans
it
is
when
the
boy
is
in
the
military
stage
of
his
ambitions
that
we
should
try
to
make
the
virtues
of
the
soldier
habitual
parts
of
his
character
it
is
when
the
girl
is
ambitious
to
make
a
fine
garden
that
we
should
try
to
make
her
fix
the
habits
of
orderliness
regularity
and
attention
to
details
of
course
not
every
girl
will
want
to
have
a
garden
and
many
a
boy
never
cares
to
be
a
soldier
but
at
every
stage
there
are
ideals
that
can
be
called
upon
to
fix
the
heart
upon
certain
virtues
until
the
latter
become
habits
it
is
very
easy
to
ridicule
the
ideals
and
ambitions
of
children
when
they
seem
to
us
too
or
futile
but
a
person
ideals
stand
too
close
to
the
centre
of
his
character
to
be
treated
so
rudely
it
is
better
to
ignore
the
many
trifling
flights
of
fancy
that
are
not
likely
to
have
any
permanent
effect
and
to
throw
the
child
into
circumstances
that
will
force
the
emergence
of
more
or
ambitions
there
is
another
danger
in
the
ease
with
which
a
child
faith
in
ideals
is
destroyed
when
these
happen
to
interfere
with
our
own
immediate
comfort
and
desires
when
a
boy
has
gotten
into
some
mischief
with
his
friends
and
is
the
only
one
caught
we
are
tempted
to
bring
pressure
to
bear
upon
him
to
make
him
tell
who
the
other
culprits
were
joe
is
ready
to
take
his
own
punishment
and
that
of
his
fellow
malefactors
too
rather
than
snitch
but
for
some
reason
we
feel
that
justice
demands
the
conviction
of
every
individual
involved
the
conflict
is
not
between
our
sense
of
justice
and
the
boy
stubbornness
or
wilfulness
it
is
rather
a
struggle
between
our
demand
for
retribution
and
the
boy
ideal
of
loyalty
if
through
threats
and
cajolery
or
more
indirect
methods
we
at
last
succeed
in
finding
out
that
it
was
brown
bob
who
was
responsible
for
the
whole
affair
we
have
at
last
broken
down
joe
inclination
to
act
according
to
certain
ideal
standards
joe
has
fallen
in
his
own
estimation
beyond
calculation
it
is
better
to
let
bob
go
unpunished
than
to
make
joe
go
back
on
his
principles
one
important
outcome
of
a
study
of
our
children
ideals
and
ambitions
should
be
the
direction
of
their
vocational
choices
we
have
read
of
benjamin
franklin
father
who
took
his
boys
about
to
various
shops
with
a
view
to
helping
them
make
up
their
minds
as
to
what
kind
of
trade
they
should
follow
nowadays
we
should
consider
this
method
rather
crude
but
for
a
variety
of
reasons
most
of
us
do
not
do
even
this
much
for
our
children
a
study
of
children
plans
and
hopes
for
their
future
work
brings
out
the
fact
that
the
desire
to
earn
money
as
a
motive
in
the
choice
increases
up
to
the
age
of
twelve
years
and
then
declines
rapidly
this
may
be
taken
to
mean
that
apart
from
the
enlarged
range
of
interests
that
comes
with
increased
experience
there
is
also
an
efflorescence
of
the
fancy
that
leads
to
increased
concern
with
ideal
ends
this
is
confirmed
by
a
comparison
of
the
choice
made
by
children
of
families
with
those
made
by
children
of
rather
poor
people
the
children
of
the
poor
in
tragically
large
numbers
appear
to
accept
the
fact
of
working
as
a
necessity
of
life
they
accept
this
doggedly
as
a
matter
of
course
the
children
of
more
prosperous
families
on
the
other
hand
though
frequently
expressing
preferences
for
the
same
kinds
of
occupations
have
their
hearts
set
on
the
joy
of
achievement
or
on
the
ideal
of
service
or
on
the
fun
of
in
much
larger
proportions
from
answers
written
by
english
children
in
a
factory
district
these
examples
are
typical
a
boy
of
eight
i
should
like
to
be
a
carpenter
because
my
mother
says
i
can
be
one
a
girl
of
twelve
i
should
like
to
go
out
when
i
am
older
to
earn
my
own
living
another
girl
of
twelve
i
think
it
would
be
nice
to
go
out
to
a
situation
in
contrast
with
these
are
the
answers
given
by
children
of
the
same
ages
who
came
from
homes
of
culture
if
not
always
of
wealth
a
boy
of
eight
i
would
like
to
be
like
major
because
i
like
carpentering
very
much
and
he
carpenters
beautifully
once
he
bought
a
box
for
his
silver
and
there
was
one
tray
to
it
and
he
wanted
to
make
little
fittings
for
the
silver
so
first
he
painted
some
names
on
some
paper
of
all
the
different
things
he
had
then
he
cut
them
out
and
supposing
he
wanted
to
put
knives
and
forks
quickly
he
would
have
a
little
name
written
down
where
they
ought
to
go
and
he
made
the
fittings
most
beautifully
quite
as
well
as
any
shop
would
a
girl
of
thirteen
one
thing
i
should
like
to
do
would
be
to
be
a
very
clever
naturalist
and
to
know
everything
about
everything
alive
or
in
the
country
world
a
girl
of
ten
i
should
like
to
be
a
piano
teacher
when
i
grow
up
for
then
i
shall
be
able
to
learn
to
play
many
pieces
of
poetry
a
part
of
this
difference
is
no
doubt
due
to
the
fact
that
in
many
families
there
are
traditional
ideals
of
the
obligations
of
privilege
which
the
children
readily
imitate
or
to
the
fact
that
these
children
do
not
have
to
think
about
the
necessity
of
earning
a
livelihood
and
so
give
their
attention
to
the
enjoyments
that
can
be
derived
from
various
kinds
of
activity
the
subject
of
vocational
guidance
which
has
come
into
great
prominence
during
the
past
few
years
includes
so
many
ideas
that
are
confusing
and
misleading
that
large
numbers
of
people
have
become
alarmed
and
are
fighting
the
movement
in
the
first
place
the
title
itself
is
misleading
most
people
do
not
enter
upon
callings
in
the
true
sense
of
that
word
they
get
into
some
kind
of
occupation
or
business
but
could
just
as
readily
have
adjusted
themselves
to
any
one
of
a
thousand
other
occupations
then
the
matter
of
is
misleading
it
is
impossible
for
anyone
to
undertake
to
guide
young
people
into
their
occupations
all
that
can
be
hoped
for
is
that
children
may
be
given
an
opportunity
to
find
out
about
the
different
types
of
work
that
need
to
be
done
and
about
the
different
human
qualities
that
are
of
value
in
the
various
occupations
the
question
that
concerns
the
parent
is
what
special
inclinations
has
the
child
that
can
be
utilized
in
a
future
occupation
it
is
not
so
much
a
question
of
making
full
use
of
your
child
talents
as
it
is
of
giving
him
an
opportunity
to
do
the
kind
of
work
in
which
he
will
be
most
happy
society
at
large
is
interested
in
conserving
all
the
different
kinds
of
ability
but
the
individual
child
is
concerned
with
realizing
his
own
ideals
with
living
so
far
as
possible
his
own
life
at
the
same
time
the
evidence
which
we
have
on
the
subject
not
very
much
to
be
sure
shows
that
there
is
really
a
close
connection
between
what
a
child
likes
to
do
and
what
he
can
do
well
it
is
of
course
true
that
one
can
learn
to
do
well
what
at
first
comes
hard
and
then
learn
to
like
it
but
we
must
not
forget
that
strong
inclinations
must
be
carefully
considered
when
future
work
is
being
decided
upon
our
children
are
so
imitative
that
a
child
with
marked
talents
will
occasionally
not
reveal
these
in
surroundings
that
lay
emphasis
on
qualities
unrelated
to
these
talents
so
many
a
boy
with
musical
ability
will
fail
to
show
this
where
music
is
looked
down
upon
as
something
unworthy
of
a
man
in
the
same
way
children
will
develop
ideals
in
imitation
of
what
goes
on
around
them
every
child
is
likely
at
some
time
in
his
career
to
look
forward
to
as
the
most
desirable
end
in
life
but
most
normal
children
will
pass
beyond
this
ideal
before
adolescence
if
however
the
atmosphere
in
which
the
child
lives
is
one
of
the
child
without
strong
tendencies
toward
other
ideals
is
likely
to
allow
this
ideal
to
persist
into
adolescence
and
young
manhood
or
womanhood
in
such
cases
the
ideal
becomes
fixed
without
indicating
that
the
individual
is
by
nature
of
an
avaricious
temperament
or
materialistically
inclined
the
same
principle
of
imitativeness
would
of
course
apply
to
other
ideals
this
explains
to
us
why
the
recurrence
of
certain
ideals
or
modes
of
life
in
successive
generations
of
a
family
leads
to
the
supposition
that
there
are
hereditary
elements
at
work
it
is
also
a
good
reason
why
we
should
guard
against
the
contaminating
influence
of
unworthy
ideals
it
is
impossible
for
us
to
carry
about
imitation
virtues
and
fool
our
children
into
imitating
them
children
begin
to
form
their
ideals
early
in
life
and
their
first
standards
are
derived
from
the
people
and
the
things
about
them
that
contribute
to
their
pleasures
sweets
and
parents
and
the
heroes
of
the
fairy
tales
as
the
child
experience
broadens
he
borrows
ideals
from
new
acquaintances
and
the
characters
he
meets
in
his
reading
the
child
absorbs
from
his
surroundings
from
his
acquaintances
and
from
his
reading
as
well
as
from
the
instruction
that
he
receives
in
school
or
in
church
materials
for
building
a
world
of
what
to
be
and
in
this
world
he
himself
plays
a
very
important
rôle
we
must
therefore
make
sure
that
the
materials
for
ideals
which
are
within
our
control
shall
be
of
the
best
loose
conversation
cynicism
open
disrespect
for
the
noble
things
in
human
character
lack
of
faith
in
human
nature
can
not
be
exhibited
to
the
child
day
after
day
without
having
their
sinister
effect
it
is
true
that
some
children
here
and
there
will
resist
these
unfavorable
influences
and
will
come
out
of
the
struggle
strong
and
with
faith
in
their
own
ideals
and
with
faith
in
mankind
but
we
can
not
afford
to
treat
the
developing
character
of
the
child
on
the
theory
that
it
needs
exercise
and
temptation
as
a
gymnast
needs
exercise
and
trying
tasks
the
temptation
that
becomes
a
habitual
stimulus
to
wrong
doing
or
wrong
thinking
has
no
moral
value
the
child
is
only
too
ready
to
follow
the
path
of
least
resistance
and
the
temptations
will
come
aplenty
after
the
ideals
begin
to
form
high
ideals
in
the
home
and
not
merely
good
words
loyalty
to
ideals
and
a
spirit
of
confidence
in
the
children
are
needed
to
give
the
children
that
confidence
in
themselves
which
they
need
to
make
them
loyal
to
their
own
ideals
when
these
are
out
of
harmony
with
vulgar
fashion
xii
the
stork
or
the
truth
mother
where
do
babies
come
from
some
day
you
will
be
asked
this
question
by
your
little
girl
or
your
little
boy
if
you
have
not
already
been
asked
what
will
your
answer
be
even
if
you
have
been
accustomed
to
giving
frank
answers
to
your
children
questions
about
all
sorts
of
subjects
you
are
likely
to
hesitate
when
it
comes
to
this
you
will
be
tempted
to
say
what
you
were
probably
told
yourself
under
similar
circumstances
you
will
perhaps
say
that
the
doctor
brings
babies
in
his
satchel
or
that
the
stork
brings
babies
in
his
bill
or
perhaps
you
will
feel
impelled
to
tell
harry
to
go
out
and
play
and
ask
you
again
a
few
years
later
when
he
will
be
old
enough
to
understand
the
telling
of
a
myth
like
the
stork
story
is
harmless
enough
for
the
time
being
we
have
entertained
santa
claus
for
ages
without
undermining
the
morals
of
our
children
and
we
shall
continue
to
retell
the
fairy
stories
for
although
they
are
not
strictly
speaking
true
stories
they
have
their
place
in
the
life
of
the
child
why
can
we
not
go
on
then
as
we
have
done
in
the
past
leaning
upon
the
stork
the
difference
between
the
story
of
where
babies
come
from
and
the
story
of
santa
claus
or
mother
hubbard
is
a
very
important
one
santa
claus
and
mother
hubbard
represent
ideas
and
interests
that
are
but
passing
phases
in
the
child
development
whereas
knowledge
about
reproduction
is
something
that
grows
in
interest
with
the
years
and
reaches
its
deepest
significance
just
at
the
time
when
you
can
hardly
if
at
all
regain
your
hold
upon
your
child
once
you
have
lost
it
it
does
not
matter
much
who
disillusions
your
child
about
santa
claus
the
disappointment
is
brief
and
soon
the
child
can
look
upon
the
legend
as
a
joke
but
it
does
matter
very
much
who
tells
your
child
that
the
stork
story
is
all
a
lie
and
he
is
told
it
is
well
for
mothers
to
realize
that
the
embarrassment
which
they
may
feel
when
this
question
is
first
asked
is
quite
foreign
to
the
child
for
the
child
at
this
time
has
no
knowledge
whatever
of
sex
to
him
it
is
simply
a
question
for
satisfying
his
momentary
curiosity
later
on
when
the
child
has
become
aware
of
the
idea
of
sex
he
is
not
likely
to
ask
his
mother
embarrassing
questions
or
if
he
should
ask
them
the
situation
would
be
equally
embarrassing
to
both
unless
you
have
in
the
meanwhile
kept
in
close
sympathy
with
your
children
and
they
feel
that
they
can
come
to
you
with
any
question
and
be
answered
frankly
and
the
way
to
keep
them
in
close
sympathy
is
by
meeting
frankly
every
question
as
it
arises
it
is
not
necessary
to
answer
every
question
by
telling
everything
you
know
it
is
necessary
merely
to
tell
enough
to
satisfy
the
immediate
need
not
only
then
does
your
frank
answer
tend
to
keep
the
child
in
touch
with
the
mother
but
you
protect
him
in
this
manner
against
going
for
his
information
to
sources
that
are
frequently
contaminating
the
information
that
boys
and
girls
give
one
another
about
sex
matters
is
often
something
appalling
not
only
in
its
distance
from
the
truth
but
in
the
amount
of
filth
with
which
it
is
encrusted
it
is
the
desire
to
keep
his
mind
clean
then
that
should
prompt
the
mother
to
tell
her
child
what
he
wants
to
know
when
he
wants
to
know
it
a
third
consideration
is
found
in
the
fact
that
many
children
when
they
do
not
receive
satisfactory
answers
to
their
queries
will
reflect
and
brood
about
the
subject
to
a
degree
that
becomes
morbid
this
is
especially
likely
to
happen
where
the
subject
of
the
child
inquiry
is
treated
as
though
it
were
an
improper
or
a
wicked
one
to
speak
about
so
that
the
child
dares
not
ask
others
for
enlightenment
that
the
early
answering
of
the
child
questions
may
offset
both
morbid
curiosity
and
the
danger
of
resorting
to
filthy
sources
of
information
is
illustrated
by
the
story
of
a
boy
who
was
invited
by
an
older
boy
to
come
to
the
for
the
purpose
of
being
told
an
important
secret
if
you
promise
not
to
tell
any
one
the
older
boy
began
i
will
tell
you
where
babies
come
from
why
i
know
where
babies
come
from
replied
the
second
not
greatly
interested
oh
yes
you
do
i
suppose
you
think
that
a
stork
brings
them
well
you
off
there
the
stork
ai
got
nothing
to
do
with
it
the
instructor
continued
breathlessly
for
fear
of
being
deprived
of
his
opportunity
to
impart
his
precious
secret
at
last
the
secret
was
out
but
the
younger
replied
coolly
that
nothing
my
mother
told
me
that
when
i
was
four
years
old
since
the
matter
had
ceased
to
be
a
secret
and
since
the
story
even
lacked
novelty
all
opportunity
for
the
elaboration
of
details
was
destroyed
but
what
can
you
tell
to
a
child
of
four
or
five
for
that
is
the
age
at
which
the
question
is
likely
first
to
present
itself
remember
that
the
child
is
not
asking
a
sex
question
but
one
about
the
direct
source
of
himself
or
about
some
particular
baby
that
he
has
seen
you
can
say
that
the
baby
grew
from
a
tiny
egg
which
is
in
a
little
chamber
that
grows
as
the
baby
grows
until
the
baby
is
big
enough
to
come
out
this
will
satisfy
most
children
for
a
considerable
time
but
some
children
will
immediately
ask
where
is
that
little
room
to
which
you
may
reply
the
growing
baby
must
be
kept
in
the
most
protected
place
possible
so
it
is
kept
under
the
mother
heart
or
you
may
say
that
the
baby
grew
from
a
seed
implanted
in
the
mother
body
that
it
was
nourished
by
her
blood
until
it
grew
large
enough
when
it
came
out
at
the
cost
of
much
suffering
of
course
you
will
tell
the
story
as
personally
as
you
can
about
your
particular
child
and
in
as
simple
a
way
as
you
can
if
you
tell
the
little
girl
or
boy
this
much
you
have
told
him
all
that
he
probably
cares
to
know
at
this
time
you
have
told
the
truth
so
that
you
have
nothing
to
fear
about
his
being
disillusioned
either
as
to
the
story
or
as
to
your
own
trustworthiness
and
you
have
avoided
arousing
the
suspicion
that
certain
subjects
are
unworthy
of
understanding
and
then
you
will
find
that
this
new
conception
of
his
relation
to
you
as
truly
a
part
of
your
being
will
deepen
and
strengthen
his
natural
feeling
of
affection
and
sympathy
it
is
also
well
with
the
first
telling
to
impress
the
child
in
so
many
words
if
necessary
with
the
idea
that
he
must
always
come
to
you
for
anything
he
wants
to
know
and
that
you
are
always
glad
to
tell
him
as
the
child
grows
older
his
knowledge
of
life
must
grow
also
in
the
country
and
in
small
towns
the
child
becomes
familiar
with
many
important
facts
about
life
without
any
special
effort
being
required
to
inform
him
he
learns
that
chickies
hatch
out
of
eggs
and
that
the
eggs
have
been
laid
by
the
mother
hen
he
learns
that
the
field
and
garden
plants
grow
from
seeds
and
that
the
seeds
were
borne
by
the
mother
plants
he
learns
about
the
coming
of
the
calf
and
the
colt
and
even
city
children
can
learn
that
kittens
and
puppies
come
from
mother
animals
it
is
a
comparatively
simple
matter
for
a
child
with
such
knowledge
to
get
the
further
information
that
the
baby
brother
developed
from
an
egg
that
mother
kept
near
her
heart
during
the
hatching
time
much
of
this
knowledge
that
the
country
child
acquires
incidentally
must
be
brought
to
the
city
child
through
special
efforts
and
devices
in
the
school
as
well
as
in
the
home
that
he
may
acquire
the
fundamental
facts
of
bearing
and
rearing
young
in
plants
as
well
as
in
animals
and
that
he
may
look
upon
these
facts
not
as
strange
or
disconcerting
marvels
but
as
natural
happenings
miss
garrett
one
of
the
most
successful
teachers
of
sex
and
reproduction
tells
the
story
of
some
city
boys
who
had
been
taught
these
things
and
who
had
decided
in
their
club
to
raise
rabbits
the
selection
of
a
father
rabbit
and
a
mother
rabbit
was
too
important
a
matter
to
leave
to
a
committee
so
the
whole
club
went
in
a
body
to
attend
to
these
preliminaries
the
care
the
boys
took
of
the
mother
rabbit
during
her
pregnancy
was
in
itself
an
education
later
miss
garrett
saw
the
leader
of
the
club
who
had
been
the
toughest
of
the
gang
with
another
boy
on
the
street
while
a
pregnant
woman
was
trying
to
cross
with
a
heavy
basket
come
on
jim
he
called
let
help
her
across
this
same
boy
but
a
few
months
back
would
have
ridiculed
the
poor
woman
in
her
plight
every
child
can
learn
what
jim
and
his
companion
learned
he
can
learn
to
respect
motherhood
and
to
be
considerate
of
mothers
as
mothers
it
is
very
interesting
to
see
the
great
differences
in
this
regard
between
families
in
which
the
fact
of
motherhood
is
a
secret
and
those
in
which
it
is
a
matter
of
common
knowledge
i
was
visiting
a
friend
whose
boy
knew
that
another
baby
was
expected
and
he
was
very
careful
to
avoid
annoying
his
mother
of
course
the
attitude
of
the
other
members
of
the
family
also
had
an
influence
upon
the
conduct
of
this
child
but
another
mother
complained
that
she
received
very
little
consideration
during
pregnancy
from
her
oldest
son
a
boy
of
fourteen
although
all
the
other
members
of
the
family
were
as
careful
and
as
thoughtful
as
could
be
desired
this
second
mother
however
had
allowed
her
older
boys
to
grow
up
on
the
assumption
that
sex
and
reproduction
had
nothing
to
do
with
life
or
at
any
rate
were
of
no
concern
to
them
and
were
not
suitable
subjects
to
know
about
so
that
her
boys
did
know
that
something
unusual
was
in
the
air
or
that
something
special
was
expected
of
them
the
important
thing
for
the
mother
to
do
during
these
growing
years
is
to
retain
the
confidence
of
the
children
and
to
give
them
an
opportunity
to
become
acquainted
with
the
everyday
facts
about
plants
and
animals
the
questions
that
come
to
the
child
mind
will
be
questions
of
motherhood
and
babyhood
chiefly
and
not
questions
of
sex
or
fatherhood
when
these
questions
do
at
last
arise
as
they
are
sure
to
almost
any
time
after
twelve
years
and
sometimes
even
before
you
have
a
great
advantage
if
your
child
brings
his
questions
to
you
instead
of
to
his
casual
acquaintances
of
the
school
or
street
even
if
you
are
not
prepared
to
answer
all
the
questions
for
him
the
girl
will
come
to
her
mother
and
the
boy
will
come
to
his
father
if
they
have
acquired
the
habit
of
coming
with
frankness
and
confidence
then
if
for
any
reason
you
are
not
qualified
to
tell
what
needs
to
be
told
you
may
just
as
frankly
say
so
and
refer
the
child
to
the
right
instructor
who
may
be
a
teacher
or
the
family
physician
older
children
may
even
be
sent
to
suitable
books
but
the
most
desirable
condition
is
that
in
which
the
parents
have
prepared
in
advance
to
answer
all
the
questions
themselves
and
even
to
anticipate
some
questions
illustration
in
the
country
children
become
acquainted
with
the
facts
of
life
the
child
should
receive
instruction
along
these
lines
at
various
stages
in
his
development
even
up
to
young
manhood
or
womanhood
corresponding
to
his
physical
development
and
to
his
mental
development
which
normally
proceed
in
close
relation
to
each
other
the
girl
should
be
informed
how
to
care
for
her
health
the
boy
should
be
instructed
about
the
sex
life
of
the
opposite
sex
to
know
what
they
have
a
right
to
expect
or
rather
what
they
have
no
right
to
demand
of
the
other
boys
during
the
adolescent
period
which
has
been
called
the
age
of
chivalry
and
romance
are
keen
to
appreciate
the
rights
of
others
and
their
own
duties
to
the
weak
it
is
at
this
time
that
we
are
to
appeal
to
their
sense
of
honor
in
establishing
ideals
of
purity
and
the
sense
of
responsibility
as
bearers
of
the
life
stream
the
standards
of
sex
morals
are
established
during
this
period
for
girls
as
well
as
for
boys
their
strength
to
time
of
temptation
will
lie
in
the
ideals
which
now
become
fixed
we
want
our
girls
to
grow
up
demanding
purity
of
the
young
men
they
will
meet
not
pretending
that
they
do
not
know
the
difference
and
we
want
our
boys
to
grow
up
with
faith
in
the
literal
truth
of
that
fine
line
about
sir
galahad
his
strength
is
as
the
strength
of
ten
because
his
heart
is
pure
the
parents
who
wish
to
prepare
themselves
with
a
knowledge
of
what
to
tell
their
children
in
place
of
the
old
stork
fable
of
when
to
tell
instead
of
postponing
to
a
dishonest
some
other
time
and
of
to
tell
instead
of
in
the
embarrassing
vagueness
would
do
well
to
read
some
of
the
abundant
literature
on
this
subject
that
has
been
issued
in

years
just

special
studies
in
many
parts
of
the
country
especially
during
the
war
have
made
it
clear
that
girls
in
the
adolescent
stage
are
definitely
aware
of
the
need
for
clean
and
trustworthy
instruction
on
matters
pertaining
to
the
relations
between
the
sexes
to
the
control
of
the
emotions
to
the
care
of
the
body
during
the
menstrual
period
and
to
other
problems
arising
from
the
facts
of
sex
it
is
pathetic
is
it
not
to
have
a
girl
write
some
parents
are
ashamed
to
tell
their
girls
everything
so
that
is
why
i
think
they
should
be
told
in
school
whose
parents
had
she
in
mind
another
writes
there
are
many
girls
with
no
mother
or
very
near
female
relation
that
can
tell
them
all
they
need
to
know
and
if
anything
should
happen
in
a
girl
life
she
does
not
think
it
proper
to
speak
to
a
male
even
if
it
is
her
father
are
the
girls
who
have
mothers
or
very
near
female
relations
to
be
none
the
better
or
happier
for
it
i
hope
that
mothers
will
not
continue
in
the
future
as
most
have
done
in
the
past
to
hesitate
about
giving
such
information
to
their
children
if
you
are
perhaps
tempted
to
feel
that
you
would
like
to
preserve
the
child
innocence
as
long
as
possible
you
have
but
to
realize
that
innocence
is
not
the
same
as
ignorance
we
are
apt
to
forget
how
young
we
ourselves
were
when
we
had
obtained
one
way
or
another
a
large
mass
of
information
about
reproduction
and
even
about
sex
the
question
is
not
whether
a
young
child
should
have
this
information
or
not
the
question
is
whether
he
shall
have
correct
and
pure
information
or
false
and
filthy
information
for
one
or
the
other
he
is
sure
to
get
true
knowledge
is
the
best
mantle
of
innocence
much
misery
is
caused
not
only
for
girls
but
also
for
boys
by
the
lapses
from
the
path
of
virtue
if
the
young
man
who
has
gone
astray
is
in
a
position
to
say
had
i
but
heeded
instead
of
saying
had
i
but
known
it
will
make
a
great
difference
in
the
way
he
will
later
feel
toward
the
one
person
from
whom
he
had
a
right
to
expect
protecting
knowledge
it
is
true
enough
that
knowledge
alone
is
not
a
sure
protection
against
but
you
can
have
no
moral
training
without
knowledge
and
knowledge
is
the
least
you
can
give
there
is
no
reason
why
parents
should
think
of
enlightening
their
children
on
this
subject
as
a
disagreeable
necessity
instead
of
as
one
of
the
important
means
through
which
to
be
of
real
help
to
their
children
and
at
the
same
time
to
help
themselves
to
retain
their
hold
upon
the
children
xiii
the
golden
age
of
transition
there
comes
a
time
in
the
life
of
every
boy
and
every
girl
that
brings
a
maximum
of
trials
and
worry
to
the
other
people
this
time
is
the
golden
age
of
transition
from
childhood
to
manhood
or
womanhood
the
age
of
adolescence
if
you
have
had
annoyance
and
hardship
with
your
infants
if
the
children
have
perplexed
you
and
tried
you
as
you
thought
to
the
limit
you
may
be
sure
that
there
is
more
in
store
for
you
for
the
age
of
adolescence
brings
with
it
problems
and
perplexities
and
annoyances
that
will
make
you
forget
that
it
any
trouble
at
all
to
look
after
younger
children
after
years
of
painstaking
attention
to
all
the
details
of
a
home
surroundings
in
the
hope
that
this
attention
will
result
in
distinct
gains
to
the
child
character
it
must
be
very
discouraging
to
notice
some
fine
day
that
louise
is
becoming
rather
finicky
about
the
food
which
is
just
as
good
as
she
has
always
had
and
that
arthur
is
inclined
to
become
rather
short
in
speaking
to
his
mother
not
to
say
impudent
and
both
are
likely
to
become
critical
not
only
about
the
food
but
about
a
hundred
other
things
that
they
find
at
home
and
both
are
likely
to
be
something
not
far
from
impudent
in
giving
expression
to
their
criticisms
in
fact
they
will
be
quite
prepared
to
undertake
the
education
of
their
parents
and
to
tell
you
with
alarming
assurance
just
how
and
when
to
do
things
both
at
home
and
abroad
fortunate
indeed
are
the
parents
who
have
come
to
this
critical
stage
in
their
education
equipped
with
a
sense
of
humor
however
these
unexpected
and
mortifying
outbreaks
of
inconsiderateness
and
bad
manners
do
show
that
your
early
efforts
have
all
been
in
vain
they
do
show
that
outside
influences
beyond
your
control
have
perverted
your
children
or
have
counteracted
your
efforts
they
show
merely
that
louise
and
arthur
are
still
growing
and
have
now
entered
upon
that
most
interesting
and
most
significant
period
of
the
new
birth
it
is
well
first
of
all
for
the
mother
and
the
father
too
to
realize
that
this
period
is
a
passing
one
for
this
knowledge
can
save
you
many
a
worried
day
and
many
a
sleepless
night
i
do
not
mean
that
when
the
child
comes
to
this
dangerous
age
you
are
simply
to
let
nature
and
impulse
have
their
way
i
mean
only
that
the
problems
are
to
be
met
with
many
devices
but
not
with
worry
for
we
are
coming
to
understand
some
of
the
fundamental
causes
of
the
great
changes
that
occur
in
the
nature
of
the
growing
child
at
this
time
and
we
are
learning
accordingly
better
ways
of
dealing
with
the
troublesome
manifestations
of
these
changes
not
that
we
can
lay
down
rules
for
the
proper
handling
of
all
adolescents
everywhere
for
we
can
not
every
individual
is
a
problem
by
himself
but
we
can
learn
a
better
way
of
approaching
this
precious
problem
a
more
helpful
attitude
to
maintain
toward
him
or
her
there
is
a
physical
basis
for
the
remarkable
alterations
in
the
minds
and
morals
of
this
age
the
infant
grows
very
rapidly
at
first
but
with
a
diminishing
rate
until
about
the
twelfth
year
then
almost
suddenly
the
rate
of
growth
increases
again
and
in
four
or
five
years
most
children
have
attained
nearly
their
full
physical
growth
associated
with
this
great
physical
growth
is
the
fact
that
some
organs
grow
much
faster
than
others
so
that
the
proportions
of
an
adult
come
to
be
very
different
from
those
of
a
child
in
the
meanwhile
however
there
has
been
a
great
strain
on
the
system
because
apart
from
the
demands
of
the
general
body
growth
some
of
the
organs
have
not
been
able
to
keep
up
with
the
special
demands
made
upon
them
for
example
the
growth
in
body
weight
and
in
muscle
may
proceed
more
rapidly
than
the
proportionate
growth
of
the
lungs
or
the
liver
or
the
weight
may
increase
more
rapidly
than
the
proportionate
strength
of
the
muscles
moreover
the
nervous
system
is
developing
at
a
more
rapid
rate
probably
than
the
other
systems
of
organs
and
this
strain
shows
itself
in
various
ways
that
are
disagreeable
to
adults
with
fixed
habits
and
standards
all
of
these
changes
are
intimately
bound
up
with
the
development
of
the
sex
organs
and
with
the
approach
of
sexual
maturity
a
graceful
child
becomes
awkward
and
a
child
comes
to
act
rudely
and
to
speak
quite
unlike
his
former
self
these
changes
are
related
to
the
fact
that
with
the
development
of
the
nervous
system
there
arise
impulses
for
hundreds
of
new
kinds
of
movements
which
the
child
can
learn
to
suppress
or
to
control
only
with
the
passing
of
time
this
is
the
age
at
which
the
child
is
exposed
to
the
acquirement
of
many
undesirable
muscular
habits
such
as
various
kinds
of
fidgetings
biting
of
the
twirling
of
buttons
wrinkling
of
the
forehead
shruggings
swaying
the
body
rolling
the
tongue
tapping
with
the
fingers
or
the
feet
and
so
on
nearly
a
thousand
of
these
uncontrolled
or
automatic
movements
have
been
described
in
children
of
this
age
of
course
any
of
these
movements
that
produce
sounds
or
that
catch
our
eye
are
very
annoying
to
us
and
if
we
have
never
nagged
before
we
are
likely
to
begin
now
by
saying
and
for
we
have
never
been
tempted
like
this
before
but
nagging
is
not
what
is
called
for
are
we
then
to
let
them
keep
on
annoying
others
or
are
we
to
leave
them
to
themselves
to
make
permanent
these
awkward
and
disturbing
and
often
hideous
movements
we
should
do
neither
we
should
remember
that
now
of
all
times
the
boy
or
girl
needs
our
friendship
and
our
sympathy
we
should
let
the
young
person
feel
that
our
objections
are
not
based
upon
our
momentary
annoyance
but
upon
our
concern
for
the
kinds
of
habits
he
will
acquire
and
we
should
do
what
we
can
to
help
him
break
his
habit
not
insist
that
he
break
it
for
us
moreover
it
is
not
certain
that
all
of
these
fidgetings
and
tappings
should
be
suppressed
upon
their
first
appearance
most
of
these
automatic
movements
disappear
of
themselves
as
the
child
matures
and
learns
to
direct
his
nervous
energy
into
channels
that
lead
to
useful
actions
as
he
acquires
skill
and
through
practice
in
gymnastics
or
with
tools
or
musical
instruments
or
at
some
games
and
while
there
should
be
every
opportunity
to
play
games
and
musical
instruments
and
to
handle
tools
we
should
not
be
discouraged
if
after
a
whole
day
of
hard
exertion
in
work
and
play
there
is
still
some
energy
left
for
drumming
on
the
table
or
teasing
sister
or
the
cat
or
for
dancing
a
jig
upstairs
and
rattling
the
lamp
closely
connected
with
the
rapid
development
of
the
nervous
system
is
the
fact
of
the
increasing
irritability
of
temper
this
will
show
itself
every
day
in
a
hundred
ways
of
course
it
is
unreasonable
and
of
course
the
boy
or
girl
is
not
to
be
allowed
to
become
rude
and
impatient
and
domineering
but
with
this
increasing
irritability
comes
increasing
sensitiveness
and
it
is
very
easy
for
you
to
make
him
realize
that
his
conduct
is
not
that
becoming
a
gentleman
or
that
his
manner
has
been
offensive
he
will
not
give
you
the
satisfaction
very
often
of
letting
you
know
that
he
fully
appreciates
your
point
of
view
indeed
he
will
even
make
a
show
of
disputing
your
position
he
will
try
to
argue
out
a
justification
for
his
conduct
or
at
least
a
mitigation
but
he
knows
very
well
what
his
offense
is
and
is
thoroughly
ashamed
of
himself
but
he
has
to
save
his
face
it
may
be
helpful
to
mothers
and
fathers
and
to
others
who
have
to
do
with
girls
and
boys
of
this
age
to
know
that
what
appears
to
us
as
impudence
is
very
often
but
an
expression
of
the
child
awkward
attempt
to
hide
his
discomfiture
or
embarrassment
this
is
especially
true
in
the
early
stages
of
adolescence
the
boy
or
girl
is
becoming
conscious
of
himself
as
a
person
and
resents
being
treated
as
a
child
the
only
way
he
knows
of
asserting
his
personality
is
by
affecting
an
air
of
disdain
toward
those
who
presume
to
treat
him
as
a
child
this
swagger
is
more
likely
to
be
put
on
when
there
is
a
third
person
present
it
is
therefore
always
safer
to
reserve
your
discussions
and
corrections
to
the
time
when
you
are
alone
with
your
girl
or
boy
and
can
place
your
conversation
on
an
intimate
basis
hand
in
hand
with
spells
of
most
irritating
the
adolescent
is
subject
to
spells
of
most
depressing
humility
and
indeed
at
every
point
this
period
is
marked
by
the
most
violent
contrasts
and
alterations
of
mood
hours
or
days
of
seeming
indifference
to
all
interests
and
activities
will
be
followed
by
keen
excitement
and
enthusiasm
a
fit
of
doubt
in
his
own
ability
and
worthiness
will
be
followed
by
almost
ludicrous
a
feverish
desire
for
constant
companionship
will
follow
a
dull
and
moody
search
for
seclusion
and
solitude
in
general
it
is
perhaps
wisest
to
ignore
these
changing
moods
except
where
they
find
their
outlet
in
offensive
or
vicious
conduct
we
must
remember
that
it
is
just
as
trying
to
the
young
person
as
it
is
to
the
older
ones
and
while
we
may
not
be
prepared
to
yield
our
comfort
and
our
standards
to
the
whims
of
the
girl
or
boy
we
should
seek
for
adjustment
through
sympathetic
exchange
of
ideas
and
sentiments
and
not
through
arbitrary
rules
in
any
case
these
changing
moods
need
not
in
themselves
be
considered
occasions
for
misgivings
and
worry
about
the
future
development
for
they
are
part
and
parcel
of
the
rapid
changes
in
the
nervous
system
so
complex
is
the
character
of
this
stage
that
volumes
have
been
written
about
it
it
has
been
recorded
in
song
and
in
literature
and
has
been
celebrated
in
religious
ceremonials
from
ancient
times
if
then
the
mother
finds
it
perplexing
and
somewhat
beyond
her
full
comprehension
she
certainly
should
not
blame
herself
it
has
been
said
that
the
complexity
of
the
individual
during
adolescence
is
due
to
the
fact
that
at
this
time
the
brain
and
the
whole
body
become
at
last
awakened
to
their
manifold
capacities
and
that
the
child
now
is
not
only
capable
of
doing
everything
that
a
human
being
can
do
but
feels
the
impulse
to
do
everything
but
manifestly
he
can
not
do
all
things
at
once
hence
the
rapid
changes
of
impulse
and
mood
there
is
a
sudden
increase
in
emotions
without
suitable
habits
for
giving
them
an
outlet
there
is
vague
longing
and
formless
yearning
for
the
child
knows
not
what
much
relief
and
satisfaction
come
from
physical
exertion
especially
for
boys
there
is
much
satisfaction
of
the
emotions
from
association
with
others
hence
the
growth
of
the
gang
and
the
feeling
of
kinship
adults
with
their
limited
interests
and
their
appreciation
of
the
need
for
specialization
in
the
practical
pursuits
of
life
are
often
inclined
to
look
with
disfavor
upon
the
growing
girl
or
dabbling
in
a
hundred
different
directions
not
content
with
athletics
and
hunting
the
boy
will
want
to
collect
stamps
or
eggs
to
make
a
and
learn
telegraphy
to
take
photographs
and
try
his
hand
at
the
cornet
to
experiment
in
chemistry
and
stuff
an
owl
not
content
with
dancing
sewing
and
cooking
the
girl
will
want
to

attempts
at
painting
she
will
want
to
become
more
proficient
at
the
piano
and
do
some
singing
she
will
want
her
share
of
photography
and
athletics
and
would

her
hand
at
writing
a
novel
all
these
things
seem
so
distracting
to
us
that
we
fear
either
that
the
young
person
will
become
a
superficial
dabbler
or
will
fail
to
settle
down
to
something
serious
but
much
is
to
be
said
in
favor
of
letting
every
girl
and
boy
do
as
near
to
everything
he
or
she
wants
to
do
as
possible
expertness
can
come
later
when
a
choice
of
a
specialty
has
been
made
now
is
the
time
for
touching
life
at
as
many
points
as
possible
for
acquiring
breadth
of
outlook
and
range
of
sympathy
and
interest
now
especially
is
the
time
for
trying
out
the
individual
capacities
which
may
lie
quite
beyond
the
range
of
the
conventional
pursuits
of
the
family
or
the
neighborhood
it
is
the
time
for
and
to
this
end
every
bit
of
help
that
can
come
from
the
home
and
from
the
church
from
the
school
and
from
the
community
from
direct
experience
and
from
literature
should
be
utilized
the
danger
of
early
specialization
is
shown
to
us
when
we
contemplate
men
and
women
who
have
no
interests
beyond
their
rather
narrow
routine
occupations
who
have
no
sympathies
beyond
their
rather
narrow
set
of
intimates
who
have
no
appreciation
of
human
character
and
human
service
beyond
the
small
circle
into
which
they
settled
in
their
teens
and
from
which
they
can
by
no
possibility
be
drawn
it
is
because
the
formation
of
new
habits
becomes
increasingly
difficult
after
the
sixteenth
or
seventeenth
year
that
narrow
prejudices
and
biased
opinions
should
be
avoided
by
participation
in
the
broadest
variety
of
activities
and
associations
before
the
conflicting
moods
and
tendencies
are
finally
welded
into
a
consistent
whole
the
girl
or
boy
should
make
a
part
of
his
personality
as
many
sources
of
enthusiasm
as
many
kinds
of
interest
as
many
lines
of
sympathy
as
possible
in
a
few
years
the
character
begins
to
set
and
the
of
the
character
will
be
in
large
part
determined
by
the
number
and
variety
of
emotional
intellectual
sensory
and
muscular
elements
that
have
been
developed
during
this
adolescent
period
one
of
the
characteristics
of
this
age
is
the
tendency
to
hero
worship
it
is
so
difficult
to
know
in
advance
what
types
of
heroes
our
children
are
going
to
select
that
we
are
inclined
to
feel
quite
helpless
in
the
matter
but
it
is
safe
to
say
that
earlier
training
is
sure
to
have
its
effects
although
we
can
not
always
measure
the
effect
a
boy
in
whom
a
keen
sense
of
honor
shows
itself
before
adolescence
is
not
likely
to
adopt
a
hero
in
whom
there
is
a
suspicion
of
anything
sneaky
the
new
flood
of
emotions
brings
with
it
a
host
of
new
aspirations
and
new
ideals
and
some
of
these
are
likely
enough
to
conflict
with
the
older
childish
ideals
it
is
therefore
of
the
utmost
importance
that
the
reading
which
is
perhaps
the
chief
source
of
model
heroes
for
most
children
should
be
of
a
wholesome
kind
this
does
not
mean
that
the
stories
must
be
about
paragons
of
virtue
the
villains
of
fiction
and
history
have
their
value
in
teaching
life
and
character
and
we
need
not
fear
that
they
will
contaminate
the
minds
of
the
young
for
in
most
children
the
instincts
may
be
relied
upon
to
reject
the
allurement
of
the
base
character
but
fiction
that
is
false
in
its
sentiment
that
does
not
present
truthful
pictures
of
life
is
likely
to
give
perverted
ideas
of
human
relations
and
false
standards
of
value
city
children
who
have
access
to
the
theatre
often
get
their
heroes
from
the
stage
and
the
same
thing
may
be
said
about
the
drama
as
about
fiction
it
is
only
the
too
highly
colored
and
exaggerated
melodrama
that
is
likely
to
be
objectionable
for
the
impressionable
youth
the
shows
which
are
coming
to
supply
so
many
of
the
children
with
their
chief
opportunity
to
learn
life
have
been
on
the
whole
fairly
wholesome
and
the
movement
to
secure
more
adequate
censorship
of
the
films
will
probably
leave
these
sources
of
instruction
perfectly
safe
from
a
moral
point
of
view
so
far
as
concerns
the
knowledge
of
life
that
the
adolescent
gets
the
only
real
danger
from
the
movies
and
the
theatres
is
likely
to
be
the
cultivation
of
the
habit
of
passive
entertainment
and
this
suggests
another
source
of
puzzles
of
adolescence
in
the
alternating
moods
of
excessive
exertion
and
indolence
there
is
the
possibility
of
girls
and
boys
learning
the
value
of
alternation
of
work
and
play
and
rest
but
there
is
also
the
danger
of
acquiring
the
habit
of
resting
all
the
time
and
leaving
not
only
the
work
for
others
but
also
the
activity
of
play
it
is
much
better
for
children
to
rest
because
they
are
tired
than
because
they
are
lazy
and
while
it
is
true
that
the
instincts
are
all
for
activity
it
is
easy
enough
for
the
growing
individual
to
acquire
the
habit
of
passive
absorption
of
whatever
amusement
is
provided
it
is
better
then
for
the
young
people
to
get
their
entertainment
out
of
theatricals
than
out
of
the
theatre
out
of
playing
games
than
out
of
watching
games
out
of
having
adventures
in
the
woods
and
in
the
water
than
out
of
reading
about
them
and
in
every
way
the
most
reliable
of
the
period
is
constant
activity
as
this
is
the
best
outlet
for
the
many
and
conflicting
emotions
which
are
the
source
of
the
chief
difficulties
when
arthur
shows
signs
of
getting
restless
it
is
a
great
comfort
to
be
able
to
send
him
off
on
some
errand
or
to
give
him
a
definite
task
to
do
but
it
is
also
a
great
service
to
the
boy
for
while
he
is
at
the
work
there
is
being
used
up
the
nervous
energy
that
would
otherwise
appear
at
the
surface
as
another
spell
and
this
principle
is
just
as
true
for
girls
as
it
is
for
boys
only
you
can
not
send
the
girl
to
a
piece
of
work
requiring
great
bodily
exertion
nor
does
she
need
this
so
much
work
is
not
only
a
satisfactory
for
the
emotions
in
general
but
it
is
especially
valuable
as
a
means
of
diverting
the
thoughts
and
feelings
from
the
growing
consciousness
of
sex
one
of
the
reasons
why
it
now
becomes
more
difficult
for
even
thoughtful
and
considerate
parents
to
keep
in
close
sympathy
with
the
boy
or
girl
is
this
outburst
of
new
and
varied
interests
which
clamor
for
movement
and
color
and
quick
changes
the
parent
has
in
the
course
of
years
settled
down
to
a
relatively
small
group
of
activities
and
interests
most
of
which
offer
no
appeal
to
the
growing
individual
for
instance
you
would
like
to
come
close
to
the
thoughts
and
feelings
of
your
growing
son
or
daughter
you
suggest
that
you
take
a
walk
together
now
it
is
very
nice
for
a
person
to
take
a
walk
alone
or
with
a
companion
but
the
girl
or
boy
sees
no
sense
in
taking
a
walk
unless
you
wish
to
get
somewhere
the
ordinary
conversation
and
gossip
that
a
girl
is
likely
to
hear
when
you
take
her
to
visit
a
friend
is
apt
to
be
very
stupid
to
the
girl
even
where
the
parents
have
watched
the
expanding
soul
closely
on
the
one
hand
and
have
kept
themselves
in
touch
with
a
variety
of
activities
rich
in
human
interests
on
the
other
they
often
find
that
the
intimacy
with
their
children
is
for
a
time
weakened
and
fully
restored
only
after
the
latter
have
passed
through
these
trying
years
what
is
likely
to
be
the
greatest
source
of
grief
on
the
part
of
the
parent
is
the
apparent
lapse
of
the
growing
boy
or
girl
from
standards
of
honesty
and
truthfulness
with
which
she
has
so
solicitously
tried
to
imbue
him
or
her
but
this
lapse
during
the
critical
growing
period
is
so
widespread
so
common
among
boys
and
girls
who
afterward
become
fine
men
and
women
that
special
students
of
the
problem
have
come
to
believe
that
is
quite
normal
at
least
for
boys
at
this
age
now
while
some
children
are
perhaps
by
nature
incapable
of
attaining
to
a
satisfactory
moral
level
most
children
will
under
suitable
surroundings
grow
away
from
this
state
of
lying
and
stealing
but
under
adverse
conditions
these
distressing
features
of
their
behavior
may
become
habitual
suitable
surroundings
and
treatment
would
here
consist
of
the
presence
of
good
models
and
high
ideals
sympathetic
help
in
resisting
temptation
and
not
in
a
harsh
denunciation
of
each
unapproved
act
as
evidence
of
turpitude
and
perversion
you
need
not
assume
that
there
perversion
until
that
is
demonstrated
beyond
any
doubt
for
if
the
child
is
morally
redeemable
he
should
be
treated
like
one
who
is
weak
and
who
needs
help
until
the
difficulties
are
mastered
otherwise
you
are
likely
to
encourage
in
him
the
feeling
that
he
is
hopeless
and
he
will
relax
all
effort
for
his
own
along
with
the
emotions
related
to
romantic
love
there
is
a
rapid
development
of
the
religious
side
of
the
nature
of
a
consciousness
of
the
race
as
a
whole
of
a
spirit
of
chivalry
and
disinterestedness
all
emotions
that
bear
a
tremendous
motive
power
which
needs
to
be
guided
into
suitable
channels
never
before
and
never
again
has
the
individual
the
endurance
and
the
energy
for
such
for
such
devotion
for
such
exertion
in
behalf
of
the
purest
of
ideals
at
the
same
time
the
increased
sensitiveness
shrinks
from
every
sneer
and
every
evidence
of
misunderstanding
or
unsympathetic
reproof
it
is
therefore
unwise
to
tease
the
girl
or
boy
about
the
friend
of
the
opposite
sex
it
is
cruel
to
sneer
at
their
ambitions
and
it
may
be
positively
demoralizing
to
ridicule
their
ideals
a
mother
of
unusual
intelligence
who
had
devoted
herself
not
only
to
the
routine
work
connected
with
her
household
and
the
care
of
her
children
but
had
made
special
efforts
to
keep
informed
on
what
was
going
on
in
the
world
of
thought
and
practical
affairs
and
who
had
a
busy
life
of
varied
activities
was
walking
along
a
city
street
with
her
youngest
son
just
fifteen
the
adolescent
who
was
rather
free
in
his
comments
on
what
went
on
around
him
made
this
pretty
little
speech
to
his
mother
mother
i
think
you
have
a
very
petty
mind
here
you
fuss
around
trying
to
help
out
that
poor
v
family
by
getting
together
clothing
for
the
children
and
an
odd
job
for
the
old
man
once
in
a
while
and
you
have
been
trying
to
raise
a
fund
to
complete
the
education
of
the
w
boy
and
all
things
of
that
kind
but
all
you
have
done
does
not
help
to
solve
the
problem
of
poverty
the
mother
who
had
indeed
been
carrying
on
these
various
good
works
alongside
of
many
other
activities
naturally
resented
the
criticism
of
her
son
but
what
she
minded
most
was
the
inconsistency
of
the
boy
when
a
few
minutes
later
they
passed
a
street
preacher
with
a
crowd
about
him
they
could
not
hear
what
the
man
was
saying
but
the
wise
young
adolescent
remarked
i
wish
i
had
some
money
to
help
that
fellow
with
now
thinks
the
mother
what
do
you
know
about
this
man
purposes
what
is
he
working
for
the
boy
did
not
know
but
he
wanted
to
do
something
to
help
the
cause
what
cause
he
did
not
know
and
did
not
care
for
him
it
was
enough
that
here
a
man
is
devoting
himself
to
a
cause
and
this
incident
illustrates
nearly
everything
that
makes
the
adolescent
so
puzzling
and
so
exasperating
to
older
people
first
of
all
he
had
gotten
hold
of
a
large
idea
which
he
could
not
by
any
possibility
understand
in
all
its
bearings
and
on
the
basis
of
this
he
criticises
the
charitable
efforts
of
his
mother
and
indeed
of
her
whole
generation
not
only
does
he
criticise
the
prevailing
modes
of
philanthropic
effort
but
he
condemns
these
good
people
as
having
petty
minds
because
they
do
not
all
see
what
he
has
seen
perhaps
for
as
long
as
a
day
or
two
his
attitude
is
not
reasoned
out
but
arises
from
the
deepest
feelings
of
sympathy
for
the
great
tragedy
of
poverty
which
he
takes
in
at
one
sweep
without
patience
for
the
details
of
individual
poor
people
then
the
preacher
on
the
street
corner
exposing
himself
to
the
gibes
and
sneers
of
the
unsympathetic
crowd
appeals
to
him
instantly
as
a
champion
of
some
cause
it
is
his
religious
feelings
his
chivalric
feelings
that
are
reached
he
would
himself
become
a
missionary
and
the
missionary
is
a
hero
that
appeals
especially
to
the
adolescent
there
is
no
inconsistency
between
his
disapproval
of
specific
acts
of
charity
and
his
approval
of
the
preacher
of
an
unknown
cause
in
both
instances
he
gives
voice
to
his
feelings
for
the
larger
comprehensive
ideals
that
are
just
surging
to
the
surface
of
his
consciousness
this
is
the
period
in
which
you
will
one
day
complain
that
the
young
person
is
giving
altogether
too
much
time
and
thought
to
details
of
dress
and
fashion
only
to
remonstrate
a
few
days
later
about
his
careless
or
even
slovenly
appearance
on
the
whole
however
the
interest
in
dress
and
appearance
will
grow
because
as
the
adolescent
boy
or
girl
becomes
conscious
of
his
own
personality
he
thinks
more
and
more
of
the
appearance
of
his
person
and
especially
of
how
it
appears
to
others
there
is
even
the
danger
that
the
boy
will
become
a
fop
or
a
dandy
and
that
the
girl
will
take
to
overdressing
argument
is
of
little
avail
in
such
cases
the
association
with
persons
of
good
taste
who
will
arouse
the
admiration
or
affection
of
the
growing
child
will
do
more
than
hours
of
sermons
if
the
boy
can
realize
that
one
may
be
a
fine
man
without
wearing
the
latest
style
in
collars
or
if
the
girl
finds
a
thoroughly
admirable
and
lovable
woman
who
does
not
observe
the
customs
of
fashion
too
much
neither
ridicule
nor
protest
will
be
necessary
in
general
the
adolescent
will
give
us
exercise
in
patience
and
in
imagination
and
in
ingenuity
he
will
puzzle
us
and
perplex
us
as
well
as
exasperate
us
but
if
we
can
not
remember
back
to
our
own
golden
age
we
must
try
as
best
we
can
to
believe
that
even
this
will
pass
away
xiv
heredity
and
environment
with
special
assistance
from
benjamin
charles
gruenberg
the
frequent
appearance
of
the
black
sheep
in
a
flock
of
tolerably
white
sheep
the
frequent
failure
of
the
best
efforts
of
parents
and
teachers
to
make
a
fairly
decent
man
out
of
a
promising
boy
have
led
many
to
question
whether
after
all
the
pains
and
effort
are
worth
while
we
have
come
to
question
the
wisdom
of
bothering
about
environment
just
as
we
sometimes
question
the
existence
of
a
principle
called
heredity
every
day
some
one
asks
the
question
do
you
believe
in
heredity
and
many
times
a
day
people
discuss
which
is
more
important
heredity
or
environment
these
are
certainly
questions
for
parents
since
the
answers
we
receive
must
influence
our
practice
or
conduct
in
relation
to
the
children
if
we
felt
quite
sure
that
heredity
was
everything
and
environment
nothing
we
should
reduce
our
school
appropriations
and
build
larger
jails
and
asylums
or
we
should
resign
ourselves
as
best
we
could
to
letting
nature
take
her
course
on
the
other
hand
if
we
felt
sure
that
heredity
was
nothing
and
environment
everything
we
should
proceed
at
once
to
double
our
school
equipment
raise
the
teachers
salaries
convert
our
penal
institutions
into
reformatories
and
our
armories
into
recreation
centres
and
advance
the
age
of
compulsory
education
just
as
far
as
we
thought
we
could
afford
to
those
who
place
the
emphasis
upon
heredity
in
the
attempt
to
discredit
the
value
of
thoughtful
and
painstaking
control
of
the
environment
of
the
developing
child
usually
remind
us
that
a
man
like
lincoln
achieved
power
and
distinction
in
spite
of
what
we
would
ordinarily
consider
serious
obstacles
to
complete
development
whereas
thousands
of
college
graduates
who
have
had
all
the
advantages
that
trained
tutors
and
guarded
surroundings
can
give
have
developed
into
mediocre
men
and
women
have
even
developed
into
vicious
and
criminal
men
and
women
they
will
remind
us
that
from
a
class
of
children
that
had
the
same
teachers
for
many
years
has
emerged
a
group
of
very
distinct
men
and
women
they
will
remind
us
that
brothers
and
sisters
with
the
identical
environment
turn
out
to
be
so
different
on
the
other
hand
those
who
see
nothing
in
heredity
will
point
to
the
same
lincoln
and
ask
confidently
why
his
ancestors
and
his
descendants
do
not
show
the
same
degree
of
power
and
achievement
they
will
point
to
the
same
family
of
brothers
and
sisters
who
had
the
same
heredity
and
ask
why
they
all
turned
out
so
differently
the
black
sheep
proves
just
as
much
and
just
as
little
for
one
side
of
the
argument
as
it
does
for
the
other
there
are
it
is
true
many
people
who
say
that
they
do
not
believe
in
either
heredity
or
environment
such
people
see
the
difficulties
of
the
disputants
and
reject
both
alternatives
they
prefer
to
say
frankly
that
they
do
not
understand
the
situation
that
life
is
too
complex
to
be
solved
by
puny
human
intellects
or
they
resort
to
some
equally
unintelligible
explanation
such
as
fate
or
nature
which
is
but
another
way
of
saying
that
we
never
understand
on
the
other
side
stands
the
scientist
who
refuses
to
shut
his
eyes
to
established
facts
and
insists
upon
trying
to
understand
as
much
as
possible
though
he
may
never
hope
to
understand
all
but
no
one
is
prepared
to
say
authoritatively
that
either
heredity
or
environment
is
the
exclusive
or
even
the
predominant
factor
in
determining
the
character
of
the
individual
indeed
the
voice
of
the
scientist
which
is
the
only
authoritative
voice
we
have
in
such
matters
is
telling
us
very
plainly
that
the
whole
question
of
heredity
environment
is
not
a
real
question
at
all
we
are
confronted
in
every
child
with
a
case
of
heredity
environment
and
the
practical
question
is
how
to
control
the
latter
so
as
to
get
the
most
from
the
former
to
begin
then
in
a
modest
way
to
understand
what
is
understandable
in
the
faith
that
understanding
will
grow
with
thought
and
observation
is
the
first
duty
of
those
who
are
not
content
to
fold
their
hands
in
resignation
or
despair
we
know
that
we
can
control
wherever
we
have
real
knowledge
the
cook
knows
that
she
can
not
make
roast
duck
out
of
pork
chops
but
she
knows
also
that
she
can
make
palatable
and
digestible
pork
chops
by
proceeding
in
one
way
and
that
she
can
make
tough
and
sickening
pork
chops
out
of
the
same
materials
by
changing
her
procedure
in
the
same
way
the
scientific
approach
to
the
problem
of
child
training
teaches
us
that
while
we
can
not
make
a
swan
out
of
a
goose
we
can
make
the
gosling
into
a
better
goose
or
a
poorer
goose
by
the
treatment
we
apply
to
it
a
frequent
source
of
doubt
and
misunderstanding
is
the
universal
occurrence
of
such
distinct
types
among
brothers
and
sisters
the
query
at
once
arises
have
not
these
children
the
same
heredity
brothers
and
sisters
have
the
same
ancestors
but
not
the
same
heredity
recent
biological
discoveries
teach
us
that
the
individual
develops
from
a
bundle
of
units
derived
from
the
two
parents
but
the
units
supplied
by
a
parent
never
represent
the
totality
of
the
parents
composition
nor
do
all
the
units
that
are
passed
on
come
to
manifest
themselves
as
parts
of
the
character
the
parent
passes
on
sample
units
from
her
or
his
own
inheritance
so
that
no
two
combinations
are
ever
exactly
alike
it
is
a
commonplace
observation
that
johnny
may
have
his
maternal
grandmother
chin
his
paternal
grandmother
eyes
his
father
walk
his
uncle
george
lips
his
aunt
mary
sharp
tongue
his
grandfather
alertness
and
his
mother
good
judgment
of
course
he
has
his
grandmother
eyes
or
his
uncle
lips
these
relatives
still
retain
their
respective
facial
organs
and
his
father
still
has
his
quick
temper
what
johnny
has
inherited
is
a
something
perhaps
in
the
nature
of
a
ferment
which
the
color
of
his
eyes
a
certain
something
that
makes
his
lips
develop
into
that
particular
shape
a
certain
something
that
causes
his
brain
to
respond
to
annoyance
in
the
same
manner
as
that
of
his
aunt
mary
and
the
various
ancestors
and
relatives
have
received
from
their
parents
similar
determining
factors
that
have
manifested
themselves
in
similar
peculiarities
we
do
not
inherit
from
our
relatives
or
even
from
our
parents
we
are
built
up
of
the
same
elements
as
those
of
which
our
relatives
are
built
but
each
one
of
us
has
received
his
individual
combination
of
factors
hence
no
two
brothers
or
sisters
are
exactly
alike
although
they
have
the
same
parents
and
the
same
ancestors
while
it
is
universally
recognized
that
no
two
individuals
are
exactly
alike
we
are
not
at
all
clear
in
our
minds
as
to
whether
the
important
differences
arise
from
differences
in
experience
or
or
from
essential
differences
in
we
know
that
children
of
the
same
parents
are
essentially
different
from
birth
and
that
no
matter
how
similar
the
treatment
they
receive
afterward
they
will
always
remain
different
or
even
become
more
different
as
they
become
older
it
is
becoming
more
clear
every
day
as
a
result
of
scientific
study
that
every
individual
is
absolutely
unique
excepting
only
true
twins
if
we
accept
this
individuality
of
the
person
as
a
fact
what
then
is
the
importance
of
training
or
environment
does
not
this
admission
settle
at
once
the
contention
of
those
who
see
no
value
at
all
in
a
environment
if
this
child
is
without
mathematical
ability
what
is
the
use
of
drumming
arithmetic
into
his
head
or
if
he
is
with
musical
genius
why
should
we
bother
about
teaching
him
music
he
will
take
to
it
naturally
the
answer
to
these
and
similar
questions
is
to
be
found
in
the
answer
to
another
question
namely
what
is
it
precisely
that
the
child
is
born
with
surely
no
child
is
ever
born
with
the
ability
to
dance
or
sing
or
to
do
sums
in
algebra
when
we
say
that
a
child
has
musical
genius
we
mean
merely
that
as
he
develops
we
may
notice
in
him
a
certain
capacity
to
acquire
musical
knowledge
more
readily
than
most
other
children
do
or
a
certain
disposition
to
express
himself
in
melody
or
a
certain
liking
for
music
in
some
form
or
a
certain
readiness
to
acquire
control
of
musical
instruments
in
other
words
the
child
is
born
with
a
capacity
for
acquiring
certain
things
from
the
outside
that
is
from
the
environment
he
is
born
with
certain
possibilities
which
can
become
actualities
only
if
the
suitable
conditions
are
provided
in
the
same
way
one
child
is
born
with
a
capacity
for
exceptional
muscular
development
and
another
for
exceptional
but
in
every
case
practice
makes
perfect
the
muscles
must
be
properly
nourished
and
exercised
the
will
must
be
trained
and
that
means
suitable
environment
now
while
every
individual
is
unique
not
every
child
is
a
born
genius
the
distinctiveness
of
each
child
lies
in
the
fact
that
he
consists
of
a
of
capacities
and
tendencies
each
of
which
varies
in
degree
when
compared
with
other
individuals
for
example
evelyn
has
about
the
same
capacity
for
physical
work
as
annie
but
she
stands
lower
than
the
latter
in
arithmetic
and
higher
in
language
work
john
shows
about
the
same
physical
power
as
henry
when
measured
by
running
and
jumping
and
chinning
but
john
can
hit
the
ball
with
his
bat
more
times
out
of
a
hundred
than
henry
can
whereas
henry
can
hit
the
with
his
rifle
more
times
out
of
a
hundred
than
john
can
in
a
thousand
details
any
two
children
differ
from
each
other
one
excelling
in
nearly
half
of
the
points
the
other
excelling
perhaps
in
about
as
many
and
the
two
standing
almost
exactly
alike
in
some
matters
a
child
that
excels
most
of
his
colleagues
in
one
or
a
few
points
is
said
to
have
marked
ability
in
that
direction
as
the
exceptional
athlete
or
the
child
with
exceptional
literary
or
moral
feeling
on
the
other
hand
a
child
that
seems
to
measure
well
up
to
the
average
in
most
points
and
even
to
excel
in
a
few
may
fall
far
short
in
some
matters
that
is
may
be
deficient
thus
a
perfectly
good
child
in
every
other
way
may
be
unable
to
master
the
ordinary
requirements
in
arithmetic
or
a
child
may
have
an
entirely
satisfactory
development
in
every
way
and
be
deficient
in
musical
discrimination
another
kind
of
difference
is
to
be
found
in
what
may
be
called
general
capacity
some
children
show
higher
capacity
than
the
average
along
nearly
every
line
that
can
be
measured
or
tested
without
showing
a
preponderance
in
any
one
direction
such
children
are
said
to
be
of
high
grade
or
of
high
vitality
in
the
same
way
many
children
are
below
the
average
in
nearly
every
line
without
being
particularly
defective
along
any
one
line
they
can
do
one
thing
about
as
well
as
another
just
as
the
boys
and
girls
can
do
one
thing
about
as
well
as
another
but
in
the
former
there
is
a
limit
to
the
possible
development
which
is
exceeded
in
the
latter
among
both
classes
of
children
the
full
development
depends
upon
suitable
environment
but
what
is
suitable
for
one
may
not
be
suitable
for
the
other
from
a
consideration
of
these
differences
in
degree
and
difference
in
kind
we
may
see
that
there
is
no
course
of
training
or
treatment
no
method
of
instruction
no
trick
for
the
mother
or
for
the
teacher
that
will
be
usable
for
all
children
under
all
circumstances
to
make
them
all
come
up
to
some
preconceived
uniform
standard
on
the
other
hand
if
we
consider
the
differences
as
worth
developing
and
even
emphasizing
it
must
be
obvious
that
the
training
and
the
treatment
should
be
adapted
to
the
individual
child
so
far
as
possible
starting
out
with
essentially
different
human
beings
uniform
treatment
will
not
make
them
all
alike
nor
will
treatment
make
them
all
alike
but
starting
out
with
a
particular
human
being
we
can
learn
to
treat
him
in
such
a
way
as
to
make
him
develop
into
a
more
desirable
person
than
he
would
become
if
he
were
neglected
or
if
he
were
treated
differently
and
that
is
the
main
problem
after
all
the
relation
between
heredity
and
environment
may
perhaps
be
made
clear
by
an
extreme
illustration
from
the
physical
side
here
are
two
men
both
five
feet
and
four
inches
tall
we
observe
that
they
are
both
short
now
the
shortness
of
one
of
them
turns
out
to
be
the
result
of
heredity
that
is
he
belongs
to
a
strain
of
short
people
no
amount
of
feeding
or
of
exercise
or
of
special
régime
could
have
made
him
more
than
a
quarter
or
half
an
inch
taller
the
other
man
however
belongs
to
a
race
of
rather
taller
men
and
women
his
shortness
of
stature
may
be
traced
to
undernutrition
or
to
overwork
or
to
sickness
during
his
childhood
it
is
quite
certain
that
a
different
kind
of
environment
would
have
resulted
in
his
being
as
tall
as
his
brothers
and
sisters
now
the
problem
of
training
concerns
itself
practically
not
so
much
with
the
person
who
is
particularly
long
by
nature
nor
so
much
with
the
person
who
is
unusually
short
by
nature
and
we
may
apply
long
and
short
to
every
other
trait
as
well
as
to
stature
the
problem
with
these
extremes
is
simply
to
keep
the
child
in
good
health
the
special
efforts
of
the
teacher
and
of
the
parent
are
devoted
to
giving
the
child
who
appears
somewhat
below
the
average
in
some
particular
those
special
stimulations
and
exercises
and
feedings
that
will
bring
him
up
to
the
average
we
find
the
extremely
short
too
discouraging
and
the
extremely
long
do
not
clamor
for
our
attention
but
it
is
those
near
the
that
we
want
to
help
over
to
the
other
side
of
the
dividing
line
and
this
is
just
as
true
of
an
undesirable
character
as
it
is
of
a
desirable
one
we
take
no
trouble
to
teach
honesty
to
the
child
that
seems
instinctively
honest
and
we
give
up
in
despair
with
the
child
that
convinces
us
of
his
utter
lack
of
a
moral
sense
we
concentrate
our
efforts
upon
the
delinquents
whom
we
catch
early
or
upon
those
who
are
in
danger
of
sliding
down
if
they
are
not
helped
along
perhaps
one
reason
for
the
great
confusion
on
this
subject
arises
out
of
the
fact
that
we
have
become
accustomed
to
making
a
sharp
distinction
between
physical
characters
on
the
one
hand
and
mental
and
moral
qualities
on
the
other
every
one
recognizes
family
resemblances
in
physical
features
a
particular
shape
of
nose
or
a
peculiarity
of
the
hand
appears
in
every
member
of
the
family
sometimes
for
several
successive
generations
facts
like
these
we
accept
as
evidence
of
heredity
without
any
question
we
also
recognize
that
the
joneses
of
centerville
always
take
the
measles
hard
whereas
with
the
andersons
vaccination
never
takes
but
when
it
comes
to
mental
qualities
which
we
are
not
accustomed
to
measure
or
to
recognize
with
the
same
degree
of
discrimination
most
of
us
fail
to
see
that
heredity
is
just
as
common
for
these
as
for
physical
traits
moreover
mental
qualities
take
on
such
a
great
variety
of
forms
that
their
recognition
is
made
doubly
difficult
thus
it
may
be
the
same
mental
traits
that
make
of
a
certain
man
a
successful
lawyer
of
his
brother
an
able
scientist
and
of
their
cousin
a
clever
criminal
no
doubt
each
of
these
three
men
has
qualities
in
a
degree
lacking
in
the
others
but
the
point
is
that
they
have
many
qualities
in
common
which
are
obscured
by
the
different
lines
of
development
they
have
followed
the
old
parable
of
the
wheat
cast
upon
the
ground
may
help
us
that
which
falls
upon
stony
ground
fails
of
germination
that
which
falls
upon
poor
soil
will
germinate
but
will
die
of
drought
or
be
scorched
by
the
sun
that
which
falls
upon
good
soil
will
develop
into
a
good
plant
the
of
plant
that
may
develop
is
determined
by
the
seed
by
heredity
the
plant
will
develop
is
determined
by
the
surrounding
conditions
by
the
environment
on
the
physical
side
these
facts
are
so
familiar
to
us
that
we
never
question
the
connection
between
development
and
food
or
between
development
and
exercise
or
between
development
and
other
physical
conditions
of
course
we
say
an
undernourished
child
will
never
be
strong
of
course
an
overworked
child
will
never
be
strong
of
course
drinking
and
smoking
and
other
dissipation
will
prevent
healthy
development
and
yet
do
we
not
know
that
of
two
underfed
children
one
will
show
the
ill
effects
more
than
the
other
that
of
two
overworked
children
one
will
survive
abuse
with
less
permanent
injury
than
the
other
we
must
then
have
clear
in
our
minds
the
idea
that
everything
that
happens
to
a
child
and
that
may
produce
a
reaction
or
an
effect
is
worth
considering
from
the
point
of
view
of
its
influence
upon
his
development
indeed
instead
of
discussing
heredity
environment
we
should
try
to
conceive
of
the
personality
of
the
child
as
made
up
of
the
effect
of
a
certain
heredity
responding
to
a
certain
environment
for
example
the
child
inherits
the
instinct
to
handle
things
at
a
certain
age
this
instinct
will
take
the
form
of
handling
objects
within
reach
and
of
breaking
them
we
can
not
say
that
the
child
has
an
instinct
for
breaking
vases
or
tearing
books
he
has
simply
the
instinct
to
something
with
material
that
he
can
handle
now
it
is
possible
for
the
child
to
exercise
this
instinct
only
on
material
that
can
be
broken
or
torn
it
is
also
possible
for
the
child
to
exercise
it
on
material
that
can
be
manipulated
constructively
as
blocks
for
building
clay
for
shaping
or
later
tools
of
various
kinds
in
one
case
the
child
establishes
habits
of
tearing
or
breaking
in
the
other
the
same
instincts
the
same
heredity
that
is
issues
in
habits
of
or
we
may
take
the
instinct
of
curiosity
which
every
normal
child
will
manifest
at
an
early
stage
this
instinct
may
find
exercise
in
wondering
what
is
in
parcels
or
closed
cupboards
or
it
may
exercise
itself
in
wondering
about
the
thunder
and
the
flowers
and
the
things
under
the
earth
or
it
may
be
quite
suppressed
by
discouragement
or
by
unsatisfying
indulgence
thus
the
same
instinct
may
lead
under
different
treatments
to
different
results
this
does
not
mean
that
every
child
has
the
making
of
an
investigator
it
means
that
a
perfectly
healthy
instinct
capable
of
being
turned
to
good
use
is
often
perverted
or
crushed
out
because
we
have
not
learned
to
cultivate
it
profitably
through
control
of
the
growing
child
development
there
is
abundant
evidence
that
the
mental
and
moral
capacities
are
inherited
in
the
same
way
as
the
purely
physical
or
physiological
ones
we
have
however
much
more
to
learn
about
how
to
control
the
development
of
the
former
than
about
the
control
of
the
latter
yet
this
point
should
be
clear
to
every
parent
and
teacher
whatever
the
child
inheritance
may
be
the
full
development
of
his
capacities
is
possible
only
under
suitable
external
conditions
what
these
conditions
are
depends
upon
the
combination
of
capacities
that
the
particular
child
possesses
but
to
find
out
what
these
capacities
are
we
must
give
the
child
an
opportunity
to
show
what
in
him
this
we
can
do
by
placing
him
in
an
environment
simple
enough
for
him
to
adjust
himself
to
readily
and
at
the
same
time
complex
enough
to
give
every
side
of
his
nature
a
chance
to
respond
this
is
the
significance
of
modern
educational
movements
that
seek
to
leave
the
child
untrammelled
in
his
responses
to
what
goes
on
around
him
we
have
learned
that
some
children
will
become
tall
and
that
others
will
never
reach
beyond
a
certain
height
we
seek
merely
to
keep
them
healthy
by
suitable
feeding
exercise
rest
bathing
etc
but
in
the
matter
of
mental
development
we
have
not
yet
learned
that
it
is
impossible
for
all
children
to
reach
the
same
degree
of
linguistic
or
mathematical
or
artistic
development
and
we
try
to
bring
all
of
them
up
to
our
preconceived
standard
of
what
a
child
do
in
each
line
the
thing
that
we
need
to
find
out
is
what
a
particular
child
do
and
then
we
must
give
him
the
opportunity
and
the
encouragement
to
do
his
best
the
things
we
encourage
him
to
do
will
be
the
basis
for
the
habits
which
he
will
form
for
the
skill
which
he
will
acquire
and
so
for
the
activities
that
will
yield
him
satisfaction
and
determine
his
behavior
in
relation
to
others
that
is
the
things
the
child
learns
to
do
well
will
determine
what
kind
of
a
person
he
will
be
when
he
grows
up
but
it
would
be
a
mistake
to
suppose
that
every
child
is
born
with
a
set
of
special
aptitudes
that
fit
him
for
some
particular
occupation
many
children
do
indeed
have
rather
special
types
of
native
ability
as
the
child
of
artistic
proclivities
or
the
natural
born
preacher
and
on
the
other
hand
many
children
are
born
with
marked
shortcomings
in
their
makeup
although
these
deficiencies
need
not
always
interfere
with
their
developing
into
excellent
men
and
women
for
example
a
child
may
be
or
incapable
of
mastering
a
foreign
language
in
school
or
awkward
in
doing
work
requiring
great
skill
and
yet
capable
of
doing
work
in
other
lines
those
children
that
have
proclivities
which
usually
show
themselves
early
in
life
and
which
are
commonly
associated
with
strong
likes
and
dislikes
will
no
doubt
do
the
most
effective
work
along
the
lines
of
their
native
talents
and
those
with
marked
deficiencies
should
certainly
not
be
directed
into
occupations
wherein
the
lacking
talents
are
essential
for
success
but
the
great
mass
of
children
vary
from
each
other
not
so
much
in
the
directions
along
which
their
special
abilities
lie
as
in
the
degree
to
which
they
are
capable
of
developing
the
ordinary
abilities
which
they
do
have
for
such
children
the
choice
of
an
occupation
can
not
wisely
be
made
very
early
in
life
nor
should
a
very
special
choice
be
made
until
there
has
been
an
opportunity
to
try
out
a
large
variety
of
activities
and
processes
indeed
even
for
the
child
of
decided
genius
it
is
desirable
that
there
be
a
chance
to
try
out
many
kinds
of
activities
both
physical
and
mental
this
is
desirable
not
so
much
in
the
hope
of
counteracting
his
special
bent
on
the
theory
of
supplying
exercise
for
the
functions
that
are
not
to
his
liking
as
for
the
purpose
of
giving
him
an
opportunity
to
find
out
he
can
do
and
to
give
us
a
chance
to
find
out
all
he
can
do
well
even
children
who
pass
as
average
children
however
may
be
divided
into
classes
according
to
the
variations
in
their
native
capacities
that
is
to
say
some
children
although
not
exhibiting
any
special
talents
or
special
deficiencies
are
nevertheless
more
easily
adjusted
to
doing
muscular
work
than
others
some
are
more
happy
in
the
manipulation
of
numbers
some
show
greater
patience
some
are
more
easily
fatigued
by
the
repetition
of
a
process
some
can
not
stand
on
their
feet
for
long
periods
without
suffering
and
so
on
these
differences
should
certainly
be
taken
into
consideration
first
of
all
in
the
treatment
accorded
them
in
the
school
and
at
home
in
what
is
required
of
them
in
the
selection
of
studies
etc
and
in
the
second
place
these
facts
should
be
considered
in
the
choice
of
general
fields
of
occupation
it
would
be
the
height
of
cruelty
and
of
injustice
to
insist
upon
preparing
for
and
entering
his
father
business
just
to
keep
up
the
family
tradition
when
a
little
attention
to
the
boy
work
in
school
and
to
his
play
and
to
his
personal
preferences
and
tastes
would
show
that
he
was
eminently
unsuited
for
the
business
and
at
the
same
time
well
suited
for
some
technical
pursuit
such
as
engineering
untold
misery
and
failure
spring
from
our
negligence
in
these
matters
no
less
than
from
our
direction
of
the
development
in
accordance
with
the
parents
ambitions
rather
than
in
accordance
with
the
child
discoverable
abilities
and
disabilities
how
far
short
our
ordinary
training
falls
of
giving
our
various
capacities
their
full
development
is
shown
by
the
exquisite
acuteness
of
touch
and
of
hearing
acquired
by
children
who
become
blind
in
infancy
the
senses
of
touch
and
hearing
are
here
developed
so
far
beyond
what
ordinary
persons
ever
attain
that
the
belief
is
quite
common
that
one
who
is
defective
in
one
sense
has
been
compensated
by
nature
with
special
capacity
in
the
other
senses
as
a
matter
of
fact
however
the
extreme
development
is
not
the
result
of
special
endowment
or
heredity
but
altogether
the
result
of
special
training
or
environment
there
is
a
certain
sense
in
which
the
idea
of
heredity
impresses
one
with
a
paralyzing
feeling
of
inevitableness
when
a
child
is
born
his
sex
is
irrevocably
fixed
the
character
of
his
eyes
and
of
his
hair
the
form
of
his
features
and
the
ridges
on
his
are
unalterable
except
through
mutilation
or
disease
but
up
to
a
certain
limit
the
child
will
grow
just
in
proportion
to
the
nurture
that
he
receives
and
what
that
limit
is
we
may
not
know
until
we
find
out
through
years
of
patient
effort
through
endless
trying
out
in
every
direction
he
will
grow
farther
in
some
directions
than
in
others
and
the
in
each
direction
is
the
element
of
destiny
supplied
by
heredity
very
few
however
reach
their
limit
in
many
directions
and
no
person
has
ever
reached
his
limit
in
every
direction
the
distance
we
do
actually
go
depends
in
practice
altogether
upon
the
kind
of
environment
that
is
supplied
this
environment
so
far
as
the
growing
child
is
concerned
is
entirely
within
our
control
and
we
have
no
right
to
give
up
our
efforts
and
to
shift
the
responsibility
to
unsatisfactory
heredity
until
we
are
quite
sure
that
all
has
been
done
that
suitable
surroundings
and
treatment
suitable
environment
can
do
we
must
watch
and
wait
and
work
hard
while
we
wait
and
watch
xv
freedom
and
discipline
is
it
not
strange
that
school
which
we
provide
for
our
beloved
children
for
their
own
good
at
so
great
a
cost
of
thought
and
money
should
be
so
little
appreciated
by
them
is
it
not
strange
that
school
which
is
intended
to
give
power
and
freedom
should
be
looked
upon
by
the
children
as
no
better
than
a
prison
a
good
place
from
which
to
escape
we
grown
folks
know
how
valuable
school
and
training
and
discipline
are
do
we
not
sometimes
sigh
that
we
had
not
more
of
these
blessings
in
our
own
childhood
or
that
we
did
not
take
advantage
of
the
little
we
had
if
the
children
only
knew
perhaps
they
would
not
so
eagerly
seek
to
escape
into
what
they
vainly
imagine
to
be
freedom
perhaps
grown
folks
who
have
thought
about
the
matter
know
of
course
that
freedom
is
something
different
from
merely
being
left
alone
they
know
that
freedom
is
a
state
to
be
attained
only
through
effort
they
know
that
freedom
results
from
a
discipline
which
makes
a
person
the
master
of
his
impulses
instead
of
leaving
him
their
slave
they
know
that
the
freedom
worth
striving
for
is
freedom
from
our
own
caprices
and
moods
from
our
blindness
and
ignorance
and
passions
it
is
for
this
reason
that
we
value
discipline
quite
apart
from
anything
that
it
may
contribute
to
our
ability
to
live
harmoniously
with
others
quite
apart
from
anything
it
may
do
to
increase
our
power
in
an
economic
sense
but
if
discipline
is
the
means
for
attaining
freedom
how
does
it
come
about
that
in
the
past
and
for
most
people
discipline
has
appeared
as
a
method
of
children
to
do
the
right
thing
until
they
have
the
habit
how
does
it
come
about
that
discipline
in
the
minds
of
most
people
consists
so
largely
of
children
from
doing
undesirable
acts
until
they
are
well
started
into
the
safe
age
of
discretion
the
reason
seems
to
be
that
the
need
for
discipline
or
training
makes
itself
most
quickly
felt
where
children
or
older
people
infringe
upon
the
rights
of
others
or
upon
the
proprieties
we
miss
discipline
where
a
child
fails
of
acts
impulsively
or
loses
his
temper
in
short
failure
of
early
training
is
indicated
wherever
there
is
lack
of
or
a
lack
of
proper
application
to
the
business
in
hand
it
is
therefore
natural
that
discipline
should
early
take
the
form
of
commanding
and
prohibiting
it
is
but
a
short
step
from
this
view
of
discipline
to
the
philosophy
that
what
children
do
spontaneously
what
they
like
to
do
must
be
wrong
and
the
complement
to
this
is
the
feeling
that
virtue
and
character
can
arise
only
from
doing
what
is
disagreeable
or
difficult
but
the
newer
studies
in
the
psychology
of
childhood
lead
to
a
totally
different
theory
of
character
formation
and
many
experiments
made
in
schools
and
institutions
confirm
these
new
theories
at
every
point
moreover
if
we
look
about
perhaps
even
in
our
own
homes
i
am
sure
we
can
all
find
abundant
support
for
the
modern
view
the
new
studies
have
to
do
with
the
relation
that
our
emotions
bear
to
our
activities
and
especially
to
the
formation
of
habits
to
learn
to
do
a
thing
we
have
known
for
ages
we
must
practise
continuously
and
uniformly
but
we
did
not
know
that
the
state
of
feelings
connected
with
the
performance
of
the
act
had
anything
to
do
with
the
result
richard
must
master
the
scales
in
his
music
study
these
scales
can
be
mastered
in
only
one
way
he
must
play
them
over
and
over
and
over
again
until
he
just
has
them
but
suppose
richard
does
not
care
to
practise
the
scales
over
and
over
and
over
again
suppose
that
he
does
not
care
whether
he
ever
masters
the
scales
or
not
well
he
can
be
to
practise
at
any
rate
and
perhaps
some
day
he
will
thank
his
elders
for
having
thus
forced
upon
him
the
extremely
valuable
but
unappreciated
command
of
the
scales
but
what
happens
in
the
course
of
this
forced
practise
there
is
resentment
and
antagonism
and
a
growing
hatred
of
scales
of
the
man
who
first
vented
scales
of
sloping
rows
of
notes
on
the
page
of
music
and
this
resentment
is
more
likely
to
prevent
a
real
mastery
of
the
task
than
the
enforced
practise
is
to
ensure
it
the
antagonism
will
at
any
rate
counteract
the
value
of
the
practise
to
a
large
degree
the
third
element
in
the
fixation
of
habits
that
we
have
heretofore
too
generally
disregarded
is
that
of
this
is
no
less
important
than
regularity
and
frequency
of
action
the
absence
of
satisfaction
to
say
nothing
of
the
presence
of
opposite
feelings
is
of
itself
sufficient
to
prevent
effective
learning
whether
of
knowledge
or
of
skill
and
when
the
opposite
feelings
are
present
the
acquired
act
or
idea
tends
to
be
pushed
out
of
the
system
at
the
earliest
opportunity
it
is
in
some
such
way
as
this
that
many
specialists
in
the
workings
of
the
human
mind
would
explain
so
much
of
our
forgetting
they
say
that
we
forget
either
because
we
really
wish
to
forget
the
facts
are
unpleasant
or
because
we
do
not
sufficiently
care
to
remember
the
facts
are
not
sufficiently
interesting
they
do
not
sufficiently
concern
us
out
of
the
psychological
facts
pertaining
to
the
relation
of
the
feeling
state
to
the
learning
process
and
to
the
process
is
developed
the
doctrine
of
interest
in
education
the
very
name
interest
suggests
to
many
that
this
must
be
some
plan
for
education
or
perhaps
for
giving
children
only
what
they
like
and
this
is
quite
the
opposite
of
the
traditional
view
which
is
expressed
by
the
humorist
who
said
it
does
not
matter
much
what
you
teach
a
boy
so
long
as
he
does
like
it
but
the
idea
of
interest
in
modern
psychology
does
not
mean
letting
the
child
have
his
own
way
any
more
than
discipline
means
doing
only
what
is
unpleasant
or
difficult
we
can
see
the
basic
truth
at
the
foundation
of
this
view
in
the
usage
of
the
race
which
awards
prizes
and
penalties
for
good
actions
and
evil
actions
respectively
if
you
should
be
asked
did
you
reward
maryann
did
you
punish
henry
you
would
no
doubt
say
something
like
this
if
we
reward
a
child
for
doing
what
we
approve
he
is
more
likely
to
do
that
sort
of
thing
again
if
we
punish
or
impose
unpleasant
consequences
upon
acts
that
we
disapprove
such
acts
are
less
likely
to
be
repeated
in
other
words
we
have
known
right
along
that
somehow
leads
the
child
to
repeat
the
conditions
that
brought
about
the
satisfaction
and
that
suffering
somehow
leads
the
child
to
avoid
the
conditions
that
brought
about
the
suffering
what
the
new
psychology
does
here
is
to
unify
what
we
have
known
we
say
not
the
performance
of
an
act
alone
will
establish
a
habit
not
the
repetition
alone
will
establish
it
not
the
subsequent
satisfaction
alone
all
of
these
factors
must
take
part
and
they
must
take
part
in
association
the
feeling
must
accompany
the
act
it
is
not
sufficient
that
richard
be
assured
that
some
time
in
the
vague
future
he
will
derive
deep
satisfaction
from
being
master
of
the
scales
he
must
somehow
be
made
to
feel
a
present
concern
either
in
what
he
is
doing
or
a
real
interest
in
the
outcome
the
time
that
is
to
elapse
between
the
beginning
of
his
practice
and
the
satisfaction
he
is
to
receive
must
not
be
beyond
the
child
power
to
appreciate
in
our
actual
dealing
with
children
our
experience
leads
us
to
make
use
of
these
principles
often
without
realizing
all
that
is
implied
for
example
when
the
young
child
by
your
side
shows
signs
of
weariness
and
you
still
have
some
distance
to
go
you
try
to
stimulate
his
interest
by
telling
him
of
the
good
things
to
come
at
journey
end
if
this
does
not
serve
your
purpose
you
draw
his
attention
to
the
bird
on
the
tree
only
a
hundred
feet
away
or
you
challenge
him
to
race
with
you
to
the
next
telegraph
post
and
if
you
challenge
him
to
such
a
race
you
are
sensible
enough
to
let
him
win
it
for
you
know
very
well
that
nothing
will
discourage
him
so
much
as
defeat
that
is
the
unpleasant
feeling
of
failure
and
you
know
that
nothing
will
stimulate
him
quite
as
much
as
the
satisfaction
of
defeating
you
in
other
words
you
set
before
him
one
goal
after
another
each
but
a
small
fraction
of
the
main
journey
and
each
within
the
appreciation
of
the
child
and
each
offering
a
satisfactory
conclusion
that
is
readily
and
eagerly
seized
as
striving
here
and
now
now
it
may
be
asked
what
discipline
is
there
in
doing
always
what
brings
satisfaction
how
can
the
children
ever
learn
to
do
the
disagreeable
but
necessary
tasks
that
make
up
so
large
a
part
of
living
where
will
they
ever
learn
that
some
things
must
be
done
not
because
we
like
to
do
them
but
because
it
is
our
duty
to
do
them
and
these
are
indeed
serious
questions
there
are
two
sets
of
answers
one
of
them
consists
of
the
results
actually
achieved
in
dealing
with
children
from
the
new
point
of
view
the
other
is
a
challenge
to
make
clear
just
what
we
mean
by
discipline
and
task
and
duty
to
take
the
latter
first
is
it
not
true
that
one
part
of
our
object
is
in
the
form
of
acquired
knowledge
and
acquired
skill
practising
the
scales
or
studying
the
multiplication
table
is
not
an
end
in
itself
we
require
study
and
practice
because
we
believe
that
the
knowledge
or
the
skill
is
worth
having
now
it
has
been
shown
over
and
over
again
that
what
is
learned
with
satisfaction
sticks
and
what
is
learned
with
pain
is
thrown
overboard
the
first
minute
the
watchman
is
off
his
guard
are
the
names
of
writers
with
the
titles
of
their
books
less
well
remembered
by
children
who
learn
them
through
the
game
of
authors
than
they
are
by
children
who
might
be
required
to
memorize
them
from
a
catalog
are
the
sums
and
products
of
numbers
acquired
in
keeping
scores
of
games
less
accurate
and
less
permanent
in
the
mind
of
the
child
than
the
same
sums
and
products
learned
as
school
exercises
is
the
skill
acquired
in
handling
tools
sewing
costumes
or
making
scenery
for
an
amateur
play
any
less
effective
or
less
lasting
than
the
skill
acquired
in
sewing
yards
of
stitches
or
sawing
yards
of
board
just
for
exercise
in
a
class
on
the
contrary
other
things
being
equal
arithmetic
and
authors
and
sewing
and
tinkering
can
be
made
both
more
effective
and
more
lasting
when
associated
with
pleasurable
feelings
than
when
performed
under
strain
compulsion
and
resentment
if
it
is
only
a
question
of
learning
this
or
that
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
pleasant
way
is
in
every
respect
the
better
way
but
of
course
it
is
not
merely
a
question
of
learning
the
specific
skill
or
knowledge
there
is
also
the
need
for
learning
application
persistence
through
difficulties
endurance
and
the
other
hardy
virtues
that
distinguish
a
disciplined
character
and
here
the
contrast
between
the
old
attitude
and
the
new
is
most
marked
we
can
certainly
force
children
to
do
what
is
disagreeable
we
can
hold
them
to
their
tasks
when
they
are
tempted
to
abandon
the
monotonous
and
wearisome
round
of
uninteresting
drudgery
but
is
this
the
only
way
to
get
for
the
children
experience
with
such
necessary
though
unpleasant
work
we
are
assuming
of
course
that
such
experience
is
necessary
since
uninteresting
work
can
not
be
separated
from
most
important
undertakings
a
typical
experience
in
a
school
that
has
for
several
years
conducted
a
class
along
the
lines
of
the
newer
psychology
can
answer
our
question
one
of
the
difficulties
that
had
to
be
overcome
was
the
mastery
of
simple
addition
another
was
the
art
of
writing
and
of
course
reading
is
a
necessary
art
of
modern
life
instead
of
the
usual
drill
and
practice
and
exercises
this
class
passed
through
the
drudgery
stage
without
realizing
that
school
was
a
prison
this
was
during
the
autumn
of
the
armistice
food
conservation
and
thrift
were
in
the
air
these
children
were
presented
with
a
quantity
of
garden
vegetables
but
there
was
more
than
they
could
use
themselves
so
the
suggestion
was
made
that
they
could
have
the
surplus
for
future
use
the
children
under
guidance
did
all
the
work
connected
with
canning
of
the
tomatoes
this
work
was
not
at
every
point
interesting
in
the
superficial
sense
but
the
purpose
of
the
entire
project
was
one
that
appealed
to
the
children
so
that
they
were
quite
satisfied
to
do
the
many
essential
details
did
they
not
here
learn
to
clean
their
dishes
and
jars
as
well
as
they
would
have
done
had
the
cleaning
been
a
duty
imposed
arbitrarily
from
above
must
drudgery
be
dreaded
to
be
well
done
let
the
teacher
who
had
charge
of
this
class
describe
what
happened
in
her
own
words
the
success
of
the
first
small
group
in
carrying
through
the
various
steps
led
to
further
work
of
the
same
sort
as
various
vegetables
were
given
us
the
children
also
dried
apples
and
lima
beans
which
they
gathered
themselves
at
the
school
farm
that
the
interest
in
this
rather
exacting
work
was
sustained
for
two
months
was
doubtless
due
to
the
fact
that
the
children
had
a
genuine
purpose
in
canning
a
large
quantity
of
vegetables
for
early
in
the
work
upon
the
suggestion
of
one
of
the
class
it
had
been
decided
to
have
a
sale
and
use
the
proceeds
to
buy
milk
for
a
sick
baby
although
i
had
not
thought
of
this
plan
myself
i
was
glad
to
lend
it
my
support
the
final
preparation
for
the
sale
occupied
a
large
share
of
the
time
for
several
weeks
the
chief
consideration
from
the
point
of
view
seemed
to
be
who
should
take
charge
of
the
business
of
selling
they
had
conducted
a
play
store
intermittently
during
the
fall
but
upon
testing
it
was
found
that
most
of
the
class
were
ill
prepared
to
act
as
salespeople
a
the
children
readily
recognized
this
fact
and
willingly
went
to
work
to
drill
on
addition
and
subtraction
the
most
successful
drill
was
accomplished
by
means
of
a
dramatic
rehearsal
of
the
forthcoming
sale
some
children
impersonating
the
visitors
and
the
others
the
salesmen
real
money
correct
prices
and
the
actual
jars
of
vegetables
and
fruit
were
used
for
this
play
footnote
a
remember
these
were
children
most
of
them
seven
or
eight
years
old
the
need
of
invitations
of
price
lists
and
of
bookkeepers
the
day
of
the
sale
was
also
recognized
and
led
to
much
needed
practice
in
written
english
the
prices
were
determined
by
a
study
of
the
latest
food
catalog
a
small
group
with
a
teacher
undertaking
this
work
it
necessitated
the
use
of
an
alphabetical
index
and
in
some
cases
the
calculation
of
the
price
of
pints
when
only
quarts
were
listed
as
we
had
used
both
pint
and
quart
jars
further
preparation
consisted
of
the
making
of
labels
for
the
jars
and
of
posters
for
the
room
the
art
teacher
when
called
in
to
advise
taught
the
children
how
to
make
accurate
square
letters
which
they
used
in
various
sizes
for
the
labels
and
posters
the
making
of
fifty
or
more
small
labels
with
letters
proved
irksome
to
the
little
people
but
they
showed
much
persistence
in
completing
the
task
because
of
their
interest
in
the
sale
the
eight
children
who
made
the
final
large
posters
did
a
great
deal
of
intelligent
painstaking
work
from
the
artistic
point
of
view
the
posters
were
not
noteworthy
but
they
represented
the
children
own
suggestions
the
sale
was
conducted
by
the
children
who
made
their
own
change
kept
records
of
sales
and
wrapped
up
purchases
the
various
duties
were
agreed
upon
by
the
class
in
accordance
with
each
one
proved
ability
to
carry
them
out
and
everyone
had
some
share
in
this
simple
account
of
an
experimental
class
conducted
at
the
ethical
culture
school
in
new
york
under
the
direction
of
miss
mabel
goodlander
are
many
references
to
drill
and
practice
but
throughout
all
of
the
work
it
was
possible
to
maintain
the
interest
of
the
children
because
apparently
the
attention
was
not
on
the
drill
as
an
end
in
itself
but
upon
the
special
skill
or
knowledge
as
a
means
to
a
more
remote
end
and
this
remote
end
was
not
the
formal
one
of
passing
or
being
promoted
or
getting
a
good
mark
but
the
vital
urgent
purpose
of
raising
money
through
the
sale
for
a
sick
baby
milk
undoubtedly
the
motives
of
the
several
children
in
this
class
were
varied
and
mixed
like
the
motives
of
good
citizens
who
are
united
in
support
of
a
particular
candidate
or
a
particular
platform
but
there
was
enough
common
purpose
to
insure
cooperation
and
persistence
and
effort
from
every
single
child
in
proportion
to
his
ability
the
learning
of
stupid
sums
and
the
practice
in
penmanship
are
no
more
attractive
to
these
children
than
they
are
to
ordinary
children
in
ordinary
schools
in
all
parts
of
the
country
but
they
overcame
all
internal
obstacles
went
through
with
all
of
the
monotony
and
drudgery
and
to
that
extent
triumphed
over
any
disposition
to
shirk
or
to
loaf
or
to
dawdle
or
to
flit
from
work
to
sensation
and
how
is
it
with
the
learning
of
responsibility
with
acquiring
a
sense
of
duty
many
of
us
have
no
doubt
learned
what
we
have
learned
of
duty
and
responsibility
through
the
constant
repetition
of
thou
shalt
and
thou
shalt
not
by
our
elders
during
our
own
growing
years
but
results
at
least
as
valuable
have
been
obtained
in
the
cases
of
others
through
the
constant
rubbing
up
against
their
equals
in
a
free
atmosphere
children
learn
to
live
with
others
by
living
with
others
they
learn
to
work
with
others
to
cooperate
by
working
with
others
they
learn
to
play
the
game
to
do
teamwork
to
play
fair
to
play
in
good
form
to
hit
hard
only
by
playing
according
to
rule
with
others
with
worthy
opponents
under
good
supervision
in
short
the
discipline
that
makes
for
power
and
freedom
may
be
quite
as
easily
obtained
through
the
exercise
of
freedom
as
through
external
coercion
nay
more
easily
and
more
effectively
it
is
fair
to
ask
whether
training
for
a
game
is
not
quite
analogous
to
our
idea
of
training
for
life
and
whether
the
methods
which
are
found
to
be
effective
in
the
former
kind
of
training
are
not
equally
valuable
for
the
latter
assuming
the
analogy
would
you
have
a
child
learn
the
rules
of
such
games
as
baseball
or
tennis
from
a
book
before
allowing
him
to
handle
a
ball
or
before
letting
him
see
a
game
would
you
expect
him
to
cooperate
in
teamwork
after
a
long
period
of
drill
upon
the
governing
team
cooperation
would
you
expect
him
to
hit
hard
because
he
has
learned
the
correct
answer
to
the
question
how
should
a
player
hit
this
may
not
seem
a
fair
comparison
to
some
of
the
training
that
has
actually
been
tried
perhaps
a
more
familiar
analogy
would
be
in
teaching
a
child
correct
movements
for
the
game
to
be
mastered
separated
from
any
experience
with
real
games
boys
are
practicing
for
a
game
and
each
one
is
drilling
on
some
special
detail
hitting
catching
running
bases
long
throws
or
what
not
each
one
of
them
has
in
mind
as
part
of
his
moving
purpose
not
only
his
team
success
and
glory
but
his
own
individual
responsibility
contrast
this
with
the
same
boys
required
to
drill
at
precisely
the
same
movements
on
the
theory
that
the
exercise
will
do
them
good
or
that
some
time
in
the
future
they
might
have
to
meet
a
situation
in
which
a
long
throw
or
a
swift
run
would
be
significant
do
you
expect
the
same
enthusiasm
and
energy
to
be
developed
in
both
cases
and
if
not
the
same
enthusiasm
and
energy
can
we
expect
the
same
results
whether
we
view
the
results
as
so
much
skill
or
technic
whether
we
view
the
results
as
so
much
training
in
drudgery
or
whether
we
consider
the
results
from
the
viewpoint
of
moral
values
as
so
much
devotion
restraint
the
moral
values
that
have
been
for
years
attributed
to
athletics
appear
after
all
to
be
the
effects
of
intense
enthusiastic
and
interested
participation
in
teamwork
that
is
in
purposeful
and
energetic
concern
with
joint
undertakings
the
responsibilities
we
wish
to
develop
the
sense
of
duty
no
less
than
the
application
and
persistence
no
less
than
knowledge
and
skill
are
types
of
habits
which
are
best
formed
under
the
glow
of
satisfying
experience
far
from
assuming
a
soft
life
for
the
child
the
idea
of
interest
assumes
the
most
strenuous
kind
of
life
and
the
experiences
of
all
who
have
tried
it
justifies
the
assumption
the
experimental
class
already
mentioned
similar
experiments
by
marietta
johnson
at
fairhope
alabama
and
elsewhere
experimental
classes
at
the
lincoln
school
and
at
the
horace
mann
school
at
various
play
schools
in
this
country
and
in
england
all
show
more
continuous
application
of
the
children
to
whatever
they
happen
to
have
in
hand
longer
periods
of
intense
activity
and
no
sign
whatever
of
loafing
or
shirking
the
activities
selected
by
the
children
themselves
involve
just
as
much
discipline
as
anything
that
can
be
selected
for
them
in
these
schools
the
children
never
hear
the
teacher
call
for
attention
for
although
everybody
knows
that
attention
is
an
essential
of
effective
work
the
attention
takes
care
of
itself
where
the
children
already
feel
a
genuine
concern
in
the
outcome
and
this
concern
insures
satisfactory
application
since
the
children
look
forward
to
satisfying
results
this
does
not
mean
of
course
that
either
the
work
itself
or
the
result
is
necessarily
pleasant
in
the
ordinary
sense
often
indeed
it
is
quite
the
reverse
as
when
the
racer
is
exerting
every
last
reserve
of
his
energy
in
the
final
spurt
or
when
the
contestants
are
in
suspense
awaiting
the
decision
of
the
judges
as
to
which
is
the
best
cake
and
the
endless
grind
of
practice
and
preparation
is
no
more
pleasant
to
the
child
who
knows
the
purpose
and
approves
the
purpose
of
his
efforts
having
taken
part
in
selecting
the
undertaking
than
similar
exertion
is
to
the
child
whose
work
is
all
planned
and
directed
by
outsiders
but
the
satisfactions
connected
with
the
exertions
are
different
in
the
two
cases
and
the
corresponding
results
are
correspondingly
different
the
principle
of
interest
as
a
guide
to
the
training
of
children
can
be
applied
in
the
home
as
well
as
in
the
school
it
means
first
of
all
taking
into
account
the
interests
tastes
preferences
of
the
children
as
has
already
been
suggested
in
earlier
chapters
there
are
many
occasions
when
the
child
may
be
consulted
or
given
a
choice
of
action
of
amusements
of
purchases
and
so
on
situations
in
which
it
is
a
matter
of
indifference
to
older
people
but
in
which
the
making
of
a
decision
or
a
choice
is
both
satisfying
and
valuable
to
the
child
even
where
the
decision
is
not
an
indifferent
one
our
own
should
not
be
imposed
in
an
arbitrary
manner
when
it
differs
from
that
of
the
child
we
can
get
his
assent
and
cooperation
where
an
arbitrary
choice
leaves
him
cold
or
even
resentful
the
games
children
play
whether
by
themselves
or
with
other
children
are
only
in
part
manifestations
of
tastes
they
represent
to
a
degree
stages
of
development
for
the
reason
therefore
that
interests
develop
we
shall
find
that
what
is
a
favorable
time
for
one
child
is
not
necessarily
a
favorable
time
for
another
child
to
learn
a
particular
thing
this
is
very
well
shown
by
the
great
differences
found
among
children
as
to
learning
school
subjects
like
reading
or
writing
in
some
the
interest
is
aroused
very
early
and
for
them
this
is
the
best
time
with
others
the
interest
does
not
appear
until
the
third
or
fourth
grade
or
even
later
and
for
such
children
this
is
the
best
time
there
is
no
one
period
that
is
best
for
all
children
by
attempting
to
treat
all
alike
therefore
we
not
only
waste
a
great
deal
of
energy
and
good
feeling
but
we
often
defeat
our
purpose
by
antagonizing
the
children
and
thus
making
them
resist
the
very
things
we
want
them
to
hug
to
themselves
and
this
is
just
as
true
of
what
we
try
to
do
in
the
home
as
it
is
of
school
teaching
to
discover
the
interests
of
the
children
requires
that
they
be
given
an
opportunity
to
express
themselves
this
means
in
most
cases
much
more
freedom
than
children
have
heretofore
enjoyed
but
it
means
also
constant
vigilance
on
the
part
of
the
elders
not
so
much
to
guard
against
the
freedom
being
abused
as
to
guard
against
the
opportunity
being
wasted
the
taste
in
games
or
in
reading
the
choice
of
companions
or
of
leisure
time
occupations
must
not
only
show
themselves
to
be
indulged
they
must
be
seized
upon
by
those
who
guide
the
children
as
means
for
giving
drive
and
direction
to
further
development
a
child
who
devotes
too
much
time
to
athletics
and
too
little
to
literature
may
be
drawn
to
reading
through
books
about
athletic
contests
of
the
classics
or
through
modern
stories
of
college
life
on
the
other
hand
the
boy
who
is
prone
to
get
his
satisfactions
vicariously
and
to
neglect
active
participation
in
games
and
other
activities
must
be
led
through
his
reading
properly
selected
and
unostentatiously
placed
under
his
nose
to
more
direct
concern
with
producing
practical
effects
in
his
environment
the
interest
once
discovered
must
be
the
means
for
stimulating
to
greater
exertion
and
to
closer
unification
of
the
child
activities
one
of
the
things
that
presents
a
difficulty
in
every
generation
is
the
fact
that
the
social
and
moral
ideals
change
from
age
to
age
we
are
thus
constantly
tempted
to
put
into
the
characters
of
our
children
those
traits
that
were
valued
highly
by
our
parents
without
always
considering
the
importance
of
each
item
for
the
days
in
which
our
children
will
play
their
parts
thus
it
comes
about
that
many
of
the
virtues
that
have
a
traditional
value
may
be
questioned
when
offered
as
staples
for
citizens
of
obedience
for
example
is
a
permanent
necessity
in
a
society
that
rests
upon
the
assumption
that
one
or
a
few
chosen
men
represent
the
will
of
the
gods
on
earth
but
has
only
a
transitory
value
in
a
democracy
as
someone
has
said
obedience
in
childhood
must
be
considered
as
a
scaffold
that
is
useful
while
the
lasting
parts
of
the
structure
are
being
put
in
place
when
the
desired
structure
is
completed
obedience
is
naturally
removed
as
of
no
further
service
now
the
kind
of
discipline
required
in
a
democracy
calls
for
an
attitude
or
disposition
that
makes
cooperation
with
others
come
as
a
matter
of
course
it
calls
for
the
making
of
decisions
or
the
forming
of
opinions
on
the
basis
of
facts
and
it
calls
for
the
habit
of
taking
due
account
of
the
rights
of
others
the
training
for
this
class
of
habits
is
best
obtained
through
methods
that
take
full
account
of
children
interests
just
as
the
older
outlook
turned
to
discipline
as
a
means
for
obtaining
freedom
the
new
psychology
utilizes
freedom
as
a
means
for
obtaining
discipline
in
both
cases
the
end
is
of
course
the
same
that
is
the
liberation
of
the
human
spirit
and
the
organizing
of
the
individual
powers
to
the
greatest
good
but
as
our
ideas
of
human
relations
and
of
values
have
changed
science
has
given
us
new
methods
for
attaining
the
final
goals
that
we
set
ourselves
